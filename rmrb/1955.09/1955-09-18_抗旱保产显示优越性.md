Agricultural Production Cooperatives Generally Achieve a Bumper Harvest

    Showing Superiority in Drought Resistance and Production Guarantee
    This year, amidst a severe drought, 356 out of 378 agricultural production cooperatives in Xin County, Shanxi Province, will achieve a bumper harvest. The autumn crops cultivated by these agricultural production cooperatives are growing very well. The "Golden Queen" corn grows like a bamboo forest, with thick cobs and full kernels. Millet and sorghum are also growing vigorously, with full ears. According to current estimates, the yields of 238 agricultural cooperatives, such as Donglou, will not only be higher than those of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers, but will also exceed the set production levels. Although 118 agricultural production cooperatives, such as Yancun, suffered severe drought, the yields of their cultivated autumn crops can still reach the set production targets.
    Because most agricultural cooperatives have demonstrated their superiority in drought resistance and production guarantee, most grain crops are growing well, which has further encouraged the demand of farmers outside the cooperatives to join. After recently hearing the good news that a cooperative will be established this autumn, farmers outside the Jiexiancun Cooperative happily said, "We've been waiting for this!" Six hundred and eighty-six households of farmers in six townships, including Donglou and Beizhang, have recently made preparations for establishing cooperatives on the basis of mutual assistance. According to preliminary understanding, more than 16,200 households of farmers in the county will join the cooperatives this autumn.

专栏：农业生产合作社普遍大丰收

    抗旱保产显示优越性
    山西忻县的三百七十八个农业生产合作社，今年在旱灾严重的情况下，已有三百五十六个社将获得丰收。这些农业生产合作社培植的大秋作物都生长得十分良好，金皇后玉米长得就像竹林一般，棒子粗大、籽粒饱满。谷子、高粱也生长茂盛，全部秀出大穗。据目前估计：东楼等二百三十八个农业合作社的产量，不但都比当地互助组和单干农民产量高。而且可超过定产的水平。烟村等一百一十八个农业合作社，虽然受了严重的旱灾，但他们培植的大秋作物的产量也可达到定产。
    由于大部农业合作社在抗旱保产中显示了优越性，使大部粮食作物生长良好，更加鼓舞了社外农民入社的要求，解原村社外农民最近听到今秋要建社的喜讯后，都高兴地说：“这可盼到了。”东楼、北张等六乡的六百八十六户农民，最近在互助的基础上，已作好了建社的准备工作。据初步了解，全县今秋将有一万六千二百多户农民入社。
