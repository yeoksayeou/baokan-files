The first high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plant in our country was officially put into production on August 26th. After departmental acceptance, adjustment tests, overall acceptance, and trial operation, the project quality was proven to be good. The vibration of the machinery meets standard regulations, the insulation tests of all electrical equipment are qualified, and not a single weld on all high-pressure pipelines leaked water or steam.

This power plant is one of the key projects of the First Five-Year Plan. This thermal power plant uses high-temperature and high-pressure equipment, with a steam pressure of 100 atmospheres and a temperature of 510 degrees Celsius. The use of such high-temperature and high-pressure equipment can greatly improve thermal efficiency and reduce coal consumption. It can save 15% more coal per year than an ordinary medium-pressure power plant of the same capacity.

The entire project of this power station adopted mechanized construction. Soviet experts provided great assistance during the construction process. All the equipment in the power station is highly mechanized and automated. Coal transportation and ash removal systems both use mechanical equipment. All boiler and turbine auxiliary equipment in the power station are operated using remote control devices. These devices can also automatically adjust water volume, air volume, and coal volume, thereby greatly improving the safety and economy of power generation.

The completion of the high-temperature and high-pressure power plant marks the rapid growth of our country's power industry's technical strength. The completion of this power plant also provides favorable conditions for the large-scale adoption of high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power equipment in the future. The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that power plants using large-scale high-temperature and high-pressure equipment will account for 32% of the total designed capacity of thermal power plants. During the First Five-Year Plan period, several large-scale high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plants will be built across the country. During the construction of the first large-scale high-temperature and high-pressure power plant, Soviet experts have helped train many engineering and technical personnel and installation workers who can master the installation technology of high-temperature and high-pressure equipment, and have trained high-quality high-pressure welding workers. They are now summarizing their experiences and preparing to welcome the construction of other high-temperature and high-pressure power plants. The first high-temperature and high-pressure power plant will also train a large number of shift workers and shift engineers with higher technical capabilities, and constantly replenish the technical strength of other high-temperature and high-pressure power plants.

Currently, this thermal power plant is transmitting a large amount of electricity and heat to nearby industrial and mining enterprises and to nearby cities.

    第一座高温高压热电站投入生产
    本报讯　我国第一座高温高压热电站在八月二十六日正式投入生产。经过分部验收、调整试验、总体验收和试运行，证明工程质量良好。机器的震动都合乎标准规定，全部电气设备的绝缘试验合格，全部高压管路的焊接面，没有一个焊口漏水漏汽。
    这座电站是第一个五年计划重点工程之一。这座热电站采用了高温高压设备，汽压是一百个大汽压，温度是摄氏五百一十度。采用这种高温高压设备可以大大提高热效率和减少耗煤量，它比一般中等压力同样容量的发电站每年可节省百分之十五的煤。
    这个电站的全部工程都采用了机械化施工。苏联专家在施工过程中给了很大帮助。电站的全部设备都是高度机械化和自动化的。运煤系统和除灰系统都利用机械设备。电站所有锅炉和汽机的附属设备，都用远方控制装置进行操作，这些设备还可以自动调节水量、风量和煤量，因而大大提高了发电的安全性和经济性。
    高温高压电站的建成，标志着我国电力工业技术力量的迅速成长。这座电站的建成，也为今后大量采用高温高压的火力发电设备提供了有利的条件。第一个五年计划规定，采用大型高温高压设备的发电站将占全部火力发电站设计能力的百分之三十二。在第一个五年计划期间，全国还要建筑若干个大型的高温高压火力发电站。在第一座大型高温高压发电站的施工过程中，苏联专家已经帮助培养了许多能够掌握高温高压设备安装技术的工程技术人员和安装工人，培养了成绩优良的高压焊接工人。他们现在正在总结经验，准备迎接其他高温高压电站的建设工作。第一个高温高压电站还将培养出大批具有较高技术能力的值班工人和值班工程师，不断充实其他高温高压电站的技术力量。
    目前，这座热电站正以大量的电力和热力输送给附近的工矿企业，输送给附近的城市。
