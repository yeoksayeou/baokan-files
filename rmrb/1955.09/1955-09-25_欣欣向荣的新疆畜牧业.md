The Thriving Animal Husbandry of Xinjiang
	Tian Guangyi

I.

Xinjiang is one of China's important animal husbandry bases. The natural pastures distributed north and south of the Tianshan Mountains and around the Tarim and Junggar Basins cover a total area of about 300,000 square kilometers, accounting for 17.6 percent of the total area of Xinjiang. About 600,000 people of minority nationalities, including Kazakhs, Mongols, Kyrgyz, and Tajiks, live on these vast grasslands. They are hardworking, simple, brave, and have rich grazing experience. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang also have good habits of raising livestock, and herds of various sizes are distributed on every oasis in the agricultural areas.

Despite the extremely favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry in Xinjiang, the number of livestock decreased year by year before liberation due to the Kuomintang reactionary rulers' implementation of cruel economic plunder. From 1942 to 1949, the number of livestock decreased by 24.7 percent, and the output of animal products decreased by more than 60 percent.

After the liberation of Xinjiang in 1949, animal husbandry entered a new era. In order to restore and develop animal husbandry production in Xinjiang, the Communist Party and the People's Government, on the basis of strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, correctly implemented the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry, including the economy of the herdowners, and the policy of no struggle, no division, no class distinction, and mutual benefit for both herders and herdowners. The People's Government has taken many effective measures to develop animal husbandry. It abolished the exorbitant taxes and levies of the old society and implemented a light tax policy for animal husbandry. It vigorously carried out trade in pastoral areas and established a trade cooperative network on the grasslands, opening up a broad sales market for the animal products of the herdsmen. The state has also given unprecedented support to animal husbandry in terms of production tools. In the past six years, it has supplied more than 33,000 pieces of equipment such as horse-drawn mowers, scythes, cream separators, wool shears, and hunting guns to herdsmen of all ethnic groups. In order to solve the difficulties in the production of the herdsmen, the People's Government has successively issued more than 4.75 million yuan in livestock protection loans; in 1953 and 1954, it allocated more than 1.2 million yuan in relief funds to purchase various female livestock to help thousands of poor herdsmen establish their families. It actively established and developed state-owned ranches and stud farms of a socialist nature, cultivated and promoted fine breeds of livestock, and assisted herdsmen in developing animal husbandry production. According to the state's production requirements and the actual situation in Xinjiang, it launched a patriotic livestock increase and protection campaign in pastoral areas, carried out large-scale animal disease prevention and control work, especially in the spring of 1954 and the spring of 1955, and led the herdsmen to overcome the snow disasters that had not been seen in decades, ensuring the safety of livestock. In promoting the development of animal husbandry in Xinjiang, the Soviet Union has also given great assistance, such as supplying fine breeds of livestock and sending experts to assist in the breeding of Xinjiang sheep and the prevention and control of various animal diseases.

In this way, after the liberation of Xinjiang in 1949, animal husbandry was rapidly restored and developed. By the end of 1954, the number of livestock in the province had increased by 42 percent compared with 1949, reaching more than 17 million head. The quality of livestock has also been generally improved. Now there are more than 30,000 of the best fine-wool sheep in the country—Xinjiang sheep—and more than 440,000 hybrid sheep improved with Xinjiang sheep, and thousands of excellent hybrid cattle and horses. The increase in animal products is also very significant.

The developing animal husbandry of Xinjiang has supported the industrial construction of the motherland. In terms of the export of animal products alone, the animal products exported from Xinjiang in the past six years, with wool alone, can be exchanged for 3,100 Stalin 80 tractors; sausage casings alone can be exchanged for all the equipment of the Urumqi Thermal Power Plant and the Ulabo Hydropower Station under construction. The machines exchanged from the Soviet Union with these animal products have been installed in factories such as the October Automobile Repair Plant and the Urumqi Thermal Power Plant. The cars exchanged are now also running on all the highways in Xinjiang, serving the urban and rural material exchange and the people's transportation. In recent years, the people in pastoral areas have also supported agricultural areas with thousands of livestock, meeting the growing needs of industrial and mining areas and urban people for meat.

With the development of animal husbandry, the lives of the herdsmen of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved. Like the advanced Inner Mongolia pastoral areas, Xinjiang pastoral areas are also increasingly embarking on the road to prosperity where both people and livestock are thriving. The concentrated manifestation of the improvement of people's lives is the general increase in the purchasing power of the masses. Herdsmen who used to wear old sheepskins all year round are now wearing new cloth clothes, and those who could not eat noodles in the past are now eating white flour supplied by the national flour mills. More and more new yurts have appeared on the grasslands. In the Fuyun grassland at the foot of the Altai Mountains, many herdsmen were forced to flee in the past due to the looting of the Usman bandits. Now it is a thriving scene. The population of Fuyun County has increased from 4,000 in 1951 to more than 17,000. By 1953, the number of livestock in the county had also increased from more than 58,000 in 1951 to more than 100,000. Seeing the happy life today, the herdsmen of all ethnic groups sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They said that it is the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who have made their people and livestock thrive, and that the dawn of socialism has illuminated the grasslands and hills of the pastoral areas.

II.

Now, there are 86 state-owned ranches in Xinjiang (including the ranches of the Production and Construction Corps stationed in Xinjiang). By the end of 1954, the livestock of the state-owned ranches had developed to more than 19 times that of 1949. In the past few years, the state-owned ranches have produced a large number of animal products for the country, and have promoted more than 18,000 Xinjiang sheep, 187 improved breeding horses, and 95 improved breeding cattle to the province and other provinces, assisting farmers and herdsmen in improving local breeds of livestock. These state-owned ranches have gradually grown into strong bases for helping farmers and herdsmen develop livestock and embark on the road to socialism.

The Gongnais Stud Sheep Farm in Xinjiang is a well-known and large-scale stud sheep farm in the country. With the efforts of Soviet expert Comrade Troitsky and all the staff of the farm, the only fine-wool breeding sheep in the country—Xinjiang wool and meat dual-purpose fine-wool breeding sheep (referred to as Xinjiang sheep)—was cultivated. According to the appraisal of Soviet experts and the working group of the Ministry of Agriculture, Xinjiang sheep rams can produce 8 kilograms of wool per year, and ewes can produce 6 kilograms of wool per year. The fineness of the wool can be spun into 60 to 64 count yarn. The wool fabrics spun by Chongqing Wool Textile Factory in China with Xinjiang wool are better than those spun with Australian fine wool. The Xinjiang sheep produced by the Gongnais Stud Sheep Farm have been widely promoted to this province and Gansu, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Northeast and other places, and are deeply welcomed by farmers in various places. In order to meet the state's requirements for developing animal husbandry, the farm has formulated a new breeding plan to ensure that it will cultivate more and better Xinjiang sheep for the country.

III.

Xinjiang's animal husbandry will develop at a faster rate, following the policy of "greatly increasing the number of livestock, generally improving the quality of livestock, increasing the production of animal products, and supporting the country's socialist industrial construction." From this year, large-scale grassland surveys have begun, from the Pamir Plateau in the south to the Altai Mountains in the north. At the same time, masses are being organized to cultivate pasture, improve grassland, to tap the unlimited potential of Xinjiang's natural grassland, open up new grassland, and prepare land for planned livestock development. Many semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas and agricultural-pastoral交错 (interlocked) areas have implemented preliminary agricultural and pastoral planning according to the state's production needs and local actual conditions, so that agricultural and pastoral production can better support each other. The People's Government is also prepared to establish more state-owned ranches to increase animal products for the country, cultivate and promote fine breeds of livestock. The state's animal husbandry and veterinary institutions are also constantly developing and growing stronger. These institutions are important technical forces for the state to assist the masses in carrying out animal husbandry production and preventing and controlling animal diseases.

Continuing to help poor herdsmen produce and build homes is an important link in the development of animal husbandry. Under the guidance of the Party and the People's Government, various temporary seasonal and perennial pastoral mutual aid organizations in the pastoral areas of Xinjiang have grown up on the basis of the original mutual aid of the herdsmen. Although these mutual aid groups have not been established for a long time, they have shown the superiority of organization in lambing and raising lambs, and in fighting against snow disasters. They have told the herdsmen of all ethnic groups with facts: the road of mutual assistance and cooperation is also the direction of animal husbandry development.

    欣欣向荣的新疆畜牧业
    田广义
    一
    新疆是我国的重要畜牧业基地之一。分布在天山南北和塔里木盆地、准噶尔盆地周围的天然牧场，总面积约达三十万平方公里，占全疆总面积的百分之十七点六。在这些一望无际的草原上，居住着哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜、塔吉克等少数民族约六十万人。他们勤劳、朴实、勇敢，具有丰富的牧放经验。新疆各族农民也有着饲养牲畜的良好习惯，在农业区的每一片绿洲上，也都分布着大小不等的畜群。
    尽管新疆有着发展畜牧业的极其优良的条件，但在解放前，由于国民党反动统治者实行残酷的经济掠夺，新疆的牲畜头数逐年减少，从一九四二年到一九四九年共减少了百分之二十四点七，畜产品产量则降低了百分之六十以上。
    一九四九年新疆解放后，畜牧业进入了一个崭新的时代。共产党和人民政府为了恢复和发展新疆的畜牧业生产，在加强新疆各民族团结的基础上，正确贯彻了保护和发展包括牧主经济在内的畜牧业政策、不斗不分不划阶级和牧工牧主两利政策。人民政府采取了许多发展畜牧业的有效措施。取消了旧社会的苛捐杂税，对畜牧业实行轻税政策。大力开展了牧区贸易事业，在草原上建立了贸易合作网，为牧民的畜产品打开了广阔的销路。国家在生产工具方面也给畜牧业以空前的支援，六年来共给各族牧民供应了马拉割草机、扇镰、奶油分离机、毛剪、猎枪等三万三千多件。为了解决牧民生产中的困难，人民政府还先后发放了四百七十五万多元的保畜贷款；在一九五三和一九五四年内，拨出一百二十多万元的救济款，购买各种母畜，帮助数千户贫苦牧民建立了家务。积极建立和发展了社会主义性质的国营牧场和种畜场，培育推广优良种畜，援助牧民发展畜牧生产。根据国家的生产要求和新疆的实际情况，在牧区开展了爱国增畜保畜运动，进行了大规模的兽疫防治工作，特别是在一九五四年春天和一九五五年春天，领导牧民群众战胜了数十年未有的风雪灾害，保证了牲畜的安全。在促进新疆畜牧事业的发展中，苏联也给予了很大的帮助，如像供应优良种畜，派专家协助培育新疆羊、防治各种兽疫等。
    这样，新疆在一九四九年解放后，畜牧业便得到了迅速的恢复和发展。到一九五四年底，全省牲畜头数已比一九四九年增加了百分之四十二，达到一千七百多万头。牲畜的质量也有了普遍的提高。现在全疆并已有了三万多只全国最好的细毛羊——新疆羊和四十四万多只用新疆羊改良的杂种羊及数千头优良的杂种牛马。畜产品的增加也十分显著。
    发展着的新疆畜牧业支援了祖国的工业建设。单就畜产品的出口来说，六年来新疆出口的畜产品仅羊毛一项就可换回斯大林八十号拖拉机三千一百台；仅肠衣一项就可换回相当于乌鲁木齐火力发电站和正在建设中的乌拉泊水力发电站的全部设备。用这些畜产品由苏联换来的机器已经安装到十月汽车修配厂、乌鲁木齐火力发电站等工厂。换来的汽车现在也正行驶在全疆各条公路线上，为城乡物资交流和人民的交通运输事业服务。几年来，牧区人民还给农业区支援了数千头牲畜，供应了工矿区和城市人民对肉食的日益增长的需要。
    随着畜牧业的发展，各族牧民的生活都有了显著的提高和改善，新疆牧区也和先进的内蒙古牧区一样，正在日益走上人畜两旺的繁荣道路。人民生活改善的集中表现是群众购买力的普遍提高。过去终年穿着老羊皮的牧民，如今都穿上了新布衣，过去吃不上面食的现在也吃上国家的面粉厂供应的白面了，在草原上出现了越来越多的新毡房。在阿勒泰山下的富蕴草原上，过去由于乌斯满匪徒的抢劫，许多牧民被迫逃亡在外，如今这里已是一片欣欣向荣的景象。富蕴全县人口已由一九五一年的四千人，增加到一万七千多人，到一九五三年全县的牲畜，也由一九五一年的五万八千多头，增加到十多万头了。各族牧民看到今天的幸福生活，都衷心地感谢共产党和毛主席。他们说，是共产党和毛主席使他们人畜两旺，使社会主义的曙光照亮了牧区的草原和山岗。
    二
    现在，新疆共有国营牧场八十六个（包括驻疆生产建设兵团的牧场在内）。到一九五四年底，各国营牧场的牲畜已发展为一九四九年的十九倍多。几年来，各国营牧场为国家生产了大量畜产品，并向省内外推广了新疆羊一万八千多只，改良种马一百八十七匹，改良种牛九十五头，支援农民和牧民改良土种牲畜。这些国营牧场，已逐渐成长为帮助农牧民发展牲畜，走向社会主义道路的坚强基地。
    新疆的巩乃斯种羊场是闻名全国、规模较大的种羊场。在苏联专家特罗依茨基同志和全场职工的努力下，育成了全国唯一的细毛种羊——新疆毛肉兼用细毛种羊（简称新疆羊）。根据苏联专家和农业部工作组的鉴定，新疆羊公羊可年产毛八公斤，母羊年产毛六公斤，毛的细度可纺六十到六十四支纱。我国重庆毛纺织厂用新疆羊毛纺的毛织品比用澳大利亚的细羊毛纺的还好。巩乃斯种羊场所产的新疆羊，已被大量推广到本省和甘肃、青海、陕西、东北等地，深受各地农民的欢迎。适应着国家发展畜牧业的要求，该场已制定了新的育种计划，保证为国家培育出更多更好的新疆羊来。
    三
    新疆畜牧业将以更快的速度，按着“大量发展牲畜数量，普遍提高牲畜质量，增产畜产品，支援国家社会主义工业建设”的方针向前发展。从今年起，南起帕米尔高原、北到阿勒泰山，已开始了大规模的草原勘查工作。同时已在组织群众培植牧草，改良草地，以发掘新疆天然草原的无限潜力，开辟新的草原，为有计划的发展牲畜准备园地。不少半农半牧区和农牧交错地区，根据国家的生产需要和当地的实际情况，实行了初步的农牧规划，使农牧生产能更好地相互支援。人民政府还准备建立更多的国营牧场，为国家增产畜产品，培育和推广优良种畜。国家的畜牧兽医机构也在不断地发展壮大，这些机构是国家协助群众进行畜牧生产和防治兽疫的重要技术力量。
    继续帮助贫苦牧民生产建家，是发展畜牧业的一个重要环节。在党和人民政府的引导下，新疆牧区各种临时季节性、常年性的牧业互助组织已在牧民原有的互助基础上成长起来，这些互助组虽然成立不久，但无论在接羔育羔、同风雪灾害作斗争等方面，都显示了组织起来的优越性。它们已用事实告诉各族牧民：走互助合作的道路，同样是畜牧业发展的方向。
