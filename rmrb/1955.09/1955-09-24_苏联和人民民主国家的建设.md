    Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Soviet Workers Discuss the Sixth Five-Year Plan
    Mass rallies and production meetings are being held in factories and mines across the Soviet Union to discuss the draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) for their respective enterprises and to propose suggestions for further developing and improving production.
    The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, the Soviet Union's largest steel enterprise, has decided to adopt several new technical innovations that will significantly increase the production of pig iron, steel, and steel products during the next five-year plan. Steelworkers plan to reduce the smelting time per furnace by one hour and the downtime of open-hearth furnaces by one-third, which could increase the steel output of existing equipment by approximately 11 percent; about 5 billion rubles are planned for capital construction. In the next five-year plan, efforts will continue to further improve the working and living conditions of steelworkers.
    Workers at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, which completed the Fifth Five-Year Plan six months ahead of schedule, proposed 600 rationalization suggestions for further utilizing internal production potential and expanding the adoption of new technologies at a conference discussing the draft of the new five-year plan for their enterprise. The fundamental transformation of production alone could double automobile production by 1960.
    In addition, workers in the coal mining, petroleum, textile, and many other industrial sectors have put forward tens of thousands of suggestions to enable their enterprises to better utilize production potential and leverage the latest scientific and technological achievements from the Soviet Union and other countries.
    Soviet Union Reclaims Nearly 30 Million Hectares of Wasteland
    The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" reported on September 10 that since the spring of 1954, the Soviet Union has reclaimed 29 million hectares of wasteland, of which 20 million hectares have already been sown with grains and other crops this year.
    As everyone knows, according to the plan for reclaiming wasteland formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in 1954, a total of 28 million to 30 million hectares of virgin and fallow land are to be reclaimed by 1956, a target that has been essentially achieved. By now, the area sown with crops on the newly reclaimed land is five million hectares more than the task set for 1955.
    In just over a year and a half (starting from March 1954, when the Soviet Union began large-scale reclamation of wasteland), the wasteland reclaimed by the Soviet Union is equivalent to the wheat sowing area of the United States, or nearly twice the total wheat sowing area of countries like Canada and Argentina, which are known as "world granaries."
    Korea Constructs Irrigation and River Management Projects
    Major construction of irrigation systems and river management projects has begun in various parts of northern Korea since September. These projects, totaling 363, are expected to be substantially completed before the next cultivation season.
    Upon completion of these projects, the irrigated area will be expanded by more than 35,700 cho (1 cho is approximately equal to 15 mu), and more than 18,300 cho of farmland will be completely protected from flooding.
    Next year, due to the conversion of 15,887 cho of dry land into paddy fields, the reclamation of 1,861 cho of wasteland, and the transformation of more than 18,000 cho of non-irrigated areas into irrigated areas, rice yields are expected to increase by more than 77,000 tons.
    Mongolian Youth Actively Participate in National Construction
    Under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League actively mobilizes and organizes the strength of young people to invest in the country's construction.
    More than 6,000 young people are enthusiastically engaged in productive labor on state-owned farms and ranches, mowing stations, and production cooperatives. Young people account for 40 percent of those working on farms and ranches, and more than 3,000 Youth League members and young people are playing an active exemplary role in production cooperatives. In 1954, 60 percent of Youth League members greatly increased the number of livestock they raised.
    On the industrial front, more than 5,000 league members form many Youth League production groups that are fighting and continuously achieving outstanding production results. This year, 199 young workers' groups participated in the nationwide competition to improve labor productivity. According to the results announced for the first half of the year, six young workers' groups exceeded their plans by more than 100 percent. A young workers' group at the leather factory belonging to the Choibalsan United Industrial Plant completed 255.9 percent of the plan for the first half of this year, improved labor productivity by 47 percent, and won first place in the competition.
    Poland Studies Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy
    Research work at the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, established in August, is progressing rapidly. The institute is building a small cyclotron, and another type of accelerator is also about to be completed. Polish scientists are beginning to build an atomic reactor. This was stated by Professor Soltan, Director of the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Corresponding Member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, to a reporter from the Polish Press Agency.
    In his conversation, Professor Soltan also pointed out that Poland will soon receive an atomic reactor and a cyclotron from the Soviet Union for research work.
    Czechoslovakia Accelerates Construction of Two Major Hydropower Stations
    The construction of two major hydropower stations on the Vltava River in Czechoslovakia is being accelerated.
    At the Orlík hydropower station construction site, the bridge connecting the two banks of the Vltava River was completed one and a half months ahead of schedule. A trial run was held on the bridge in early August, and a 70-ton Soviet-made road grader successfully crossed the bridge. From then on, various types of machinery and materials for construction can be continuously transported to the construction site on the west bank of the Vltava River.
    At the construction site of the Lipno hydropower station upstream, the last waterproof dam—the eighth waterproof dam—was completed in mid-August. The underground foundation of the dam has been completed, and workers are beginning to build the dam itself. Tunnel workers at the construction site are constantly setting new records, not only increasing the maximum excavation speed from three meters in 24 hours to 5.8 meters, but also increasing the general excavation quota to three meters per 24 hours.
    Stalin Reservoir Near Sofia, Bulgaria to be Completed
    Xinhua News Agency: The construction of the largest reservoir recently built near Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria—the Stalin Reservoir—is nearing completion. The dam that will permanently block the waters of the Iskar River will be completed in a few days. The water intake tunnel of the reservoir was completed several months ago. The water in the reservoir can flow into the tunnel within this year, driving the turbines of the Bursarel hydroelectric station. The second hydroelectric station is also about to be completed and will begin generating electricity this year.
    The construction of the Stalin Reservoir is of great national economic significance. Once completed, it can form a large lake 11 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide, allowing the Bursarel and Kokalyane hydroelectric stations to generate millions of kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, while also irrigating tens of thousands of hectares of land on the Sofia Plain.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联工人讨论第六个五年计划
    苏联各厂矿正举行着群众大会和生产会议，讨论本企业第六个五年计划（一九五六—一九六○年）的草案，并且提出进一步发展和改进生产的建议。
    苏联最大的钢铁企业马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂已决定采用一些技术上的新创造，使下一个五年计划中的生铁、钢和钢材的产量大大增加。炼钢工人计划使每炉钢的熔炼时间缩短一小时，使平炉停歇时间缩短三分之一，这样可以使现有设备的钢产量提高约百分之十一；计划用约五十亿卢布来从事基本建设。在下一个五年计划中要继续进一步改进钢铁工人的劳动条件和生活条件。
    提前半年完成第五个五年计划的莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的工人，在讨论本企业新五年计划草案的大会上，提出了六百项进一步利用内部生产潜力和扩大采用新技术的合理化建议。单从根本改造生产这一点来说，到一九六零年就能使汽车生产量增加为两倍。
    此外，采煤、石油、纺织和其他许多工业部门的企业的工人已提出了几万条建议，以便使他们的企业更好地利用生产潜力和利用苏联和其他国家的科学、技术上的最新成就。
    苏联开垦近三千万公顷荒地
    苏联“真理报”九月十日报道：从一九五四年春季起到现在，苏联已经开垦了两千九百万公顷荒地，其中有两千万公顷已经在今年播种了谷物和其他农作物。
    大家知道，根据苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在一九五四年制定的开垦荒地的计划的规定，到一九五六年总共要开垦两千八百万到三千万公顷生荒地和熟荒地，这一指标已经基本达到。而到现在，在新开垦的土地上播种的农作物的面积则比计划规定的一九五五年的任务还多五百万公顷。
    在短短一年半多（从一九五四年三月苏联开始大规模开垦荒地时算起）时间中，苏联开垦的荒地相当于美国的小麦播种面积，或者将近等于加拿大和阿根廷这样一些号称“世界谷仓”的国家的小麦播种面积的总和的两倍。
    朝鲜修建灌溉和治河工程
    朝鲜北部各地已从九月起开始进行灌溉系统和治河工程的主要建设。这些工程共有三百六十三项，预计将于明年耕作季节前基本上完成。
    在这些工程完成以后，灌溉面积将扩大三万五千七百多町步（一町步约合十五市亩），有一万八千三百多町步的田地将完全免受水灾的祸害。
    明年，由于有一万五千八百八十七町步旱地变成水田，一千八百六十一町步荒地被开垦，一万八千多町步的非灌溉地区变成灌溉地区，预计大米收成将增加七万七千多吨。
    蒙古青年积极参加祖国建设
    在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，蒙古革命青年团积极动员和组织青年的力量，投入祖国的建设事业中。
    约有六千多青年在国营农牧场、马拉刈草站和生产合作社热情地从事生产劳动。在农牧场工作的人有百分之四十是青年，在生产合作社有三千多名青年团员和青年在起着积极的模范作用。在一九五四年，百分之六十的青年团员都大大增加了自己所养育的牲畜头数。
    在工业战线上，有五千多名团员组成许多青年团生产小组在战斗着，并且不断取得优异的生产成绩。今年有一百九十九个青年工人小组参加了提高劳动生产率的全国性的竞赛。根据上半年公布的结果，有六个青年工人小组超额完成计划百分之一百以上。乔巴山联合工业工厂所属皮革厂的一个青工小组完成今年上半年度计划的百分之二百五十五点九，提高劳动生产率百分之四十七，获得了竞赛的第一位。波兰研究和平利用原子能情况
    八月份成立的波兰科学院原子核研究所的研究工作正在迅速开展中。研究所正在建造一个小型的回旋加速器，另一种类型的加速器也即将建成。波兰科学家们正着手建造原子反应堆。这是波兰科学院原子核研究所所长、波兰科学院通讯院士索尔坦教授向波兰通讯社记者说的。
    索尔坦教授在谈话中还指出，波兰很快将从苏联得到用于进行研究工作的原子反应堆和回旋加速器。
    捷两大水电站工程加速建设
    捷克斯洛伐克弗尔塔瓦河上两大水电站的建设工作，正在加速进行中。
    在奥利克水电站工地上，连接弗尔塔瓦河两岸的桥梁已经提前一个半月完工。八月上旬在桥上举行了试运，一架七十吨重的苏联制的开路机顺利地开过了这座桥梁。从此，建筑用的各式机器和物资即可源源不断地运到弗尔塔瓦河西岸的工地上。
    在上游的利普诺水电站建设工地上，工程的最后一个防水堰——第八防水堰已经在八月中旬竣工。拦河坝的地下基础已经建成，工人们正在开始修建拦河坝的本身。工地上的隧道工人不断创造新的纪录，他们不仅把二十四小时的最高掘进速度由过去的三公尺提高到五点八公尺，而且把每天二十四小时的一般掘进定额提高到三公尺。
    保京附近斯大林水库将竣工
    保加利亚首都索非亚附近新建的最大的水库——斯大林水库的建设工程即将竣工。永远拦阻伊斯基尔河水的拦河坝再过几天就要建筑成了。水库的进水隧洞的工程已经在数月以前完成。水库的水在今年以内就可以流入隧洞，带动伯萨列尔水电站的水轮机。第二个水电站也即将建成，并且在今年开始发电。
    斯大林水库的建设具有巨大的国民经济意义，它建成后可以形成一个十一公里长、三公里宽的大湖，使伯萨列尔水电站和科卡利亚涅水电站每年发出数百万瓩时的电力，同时还可以灌溉索非亚平原上的数万公顷的土地。　（据新华社讯）
