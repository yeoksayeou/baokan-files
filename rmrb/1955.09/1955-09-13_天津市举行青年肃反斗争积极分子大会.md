    Tianjin Holds Meeting of Young Activists in the Anti-Reactionary Struggle
    At the Tianjin Youth Anti-Reactionary Struggle Activists Meeting held on the 11th, 28 young anti-reactionary activists were commended by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, of whom nine also received certificates of merit.
    Communist Youth League member Yang Kegui is the deputy foreman of Class B in the cloth workshop of the state-owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory. His elder brother, Yang Baoren, was a counter-revolutionary murderer. After liberation, Yang Baoren infiltrated the state-owned Tianjin Steel Factory, pretending to be active and twice deceiving the factory to award him the title of model worker; at the same time, he hid guns and reactionary documents, attempting to wait for an opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. After Yang Kegui learned about this situation, he reported his brother. After investigation by the public security organs based on his report, it was confirmed and the hidden counter-revolutionary element was arrested according to law. Communist Youth League member Wang Wenli is a hotel clerk, and he maintains a high degree of vigilance against some guests with suspicious behavior. From 1954 to July of this year, he reported and assisted the public security organs in solving many counter-revolutionary and criminal cases. Young seal carver Wang Chunlai, since 1953, he and his father have assisted the public security organs in solving some counter-revolutionary and various criminal cases involving private seal carving. Twenty-four-year-old Communist Party member Yang Fengzao is a people's police officer. Because he can rely on the masses to conduct arduous investigations and research, he has discovered a total of 50 counter-revolutionary elements and criminal offenders in the past two years.
    More than 2,000 people attended today's meeting, and the vast number of young people outside the meeting also listened to the live broadcast of the meeting. Zhang Ze, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Fan Qingdian, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau, made reports to the meeting.
    Finally, the meeting also adopted a letter to the youth of Tianjin, calling on every young person to be an active element in the anti-reactionary struggle.

    天津市举行青年肃反斗争积极分子大会
    在十一日举行的天津市青年肃反斗争积极分子大会上，有二十八名青年肃反积极分子受到青年团天津市委员会的表扬，其中有九名还得到了奖状。
    青年团员杨克贵是国营天津第四棉纺织厂布场乙班副工长。他的哥哥杨宝仁是一个反革命杀人犯。解放后，杨宝仁一面混入国营天津钢厂做工，伪装积极，曾两次骗得厂级劳动模范的称号；一面又隐藏枪枝和反动证件，企图待机进行破坏活动。杨克贵知道了这个情况后就检举了他的哥哥。公安机关根据他的检举材料，经调查属实后，依法逮捕了这个暗藏的反革命分子。青年团员王文利是旅店店员，他对一些行迹可疑的客人，都保持着高度的警惕。从一九五四年到今年七月，他检举并协助公安机关破获了反革命和刑事犯罪案件多起。青年刻字手工业者王春来，从一九五三年以来，他就和他的父亲一起协助公安机关破获了一些私刻图章的反革命和各种犯罪案件。二十四岁的共产党员杨凤藻是人民警察，由于他能依靠群众艰苦地进行调查研究，近两年来共发现各种反革命分子和刑事罪犯等五十个。
    参加今天大会的共有二千多人，会外的广大青年还收听了大会的实况广播。青年团中央委员会书记处书记章泽和天津市公安局副局长樊青典向大会做了报告。
    大会最后还通过了给天津市青年的一封信，号召每个青年都要作一个肃反斗争的积极分子。
