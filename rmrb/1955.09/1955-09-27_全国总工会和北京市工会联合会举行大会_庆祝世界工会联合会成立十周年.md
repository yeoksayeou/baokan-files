Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions jointly held a meeting today to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Participating in the meeting were Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman, Li Jiebo, Liu Ziju, Li Zaiwen, and Dong Xin, Secretaries of the Secretariat, responsible persons from the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and various industrial trade unions under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and more than 1,700 workers from various industrial systems in Beijing.

Also invited to attend the celebration were M.V. Sherov, Soviet member of the WFTU Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau, B.N. Mukherjee, Indian member, A. Yaya, Indonesian member, Kaneko Kenta, representative of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions to the Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau, and Vasilyev, head of the Soviet Trade Union Sports Delegation who recently visited China, and all members of the delegation.

Wang Jiong, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the opening speech. He said that the World Federation of Trade Unions was established on October 3, 1945. Over the past ten years since its establishment, the WFTU has made significant contributions to the great cause of the international working class. In the struggle of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country to win their liberation, the WFTU has also given us strong support. Therefore, the tenth anniversary of the WFTU is a great happy event for the working class around the world, and also a great happy event for the Chinese working class. We are proud of the work done and the achievements made by the WFTU in the past ten years, and we congratulate it on achieving greater victories in the years to come.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, then spoke. He said: For the past ten years, the WFTU has consistently carried out unyielding struggles for the great cause of the international working class. The WFTU has always regarded the realization of the wishes and demands of workers around the world as its own task. The consistent actions of the WFTU over the past ten years have convincingly proved that it has not disappointed the trust and hope of workers around the world. Precisely because of this, it has received the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers internationally. Lai Ruoyu then described the great contributions made by the WFTU in strengthening the international and domestic unity of the working class, realizing the economic and social demands of the working class, striving for trade union and democratic rights, and striving for national independence and world peace.

Lai Ruoyu said: As a member of the WFTU, the Chinese trade union has consistently supported and earnestly implemented the various policies of the WFTU and actively responded to the calls of the WFTU. Even before the victory of the Chinese revolution, we sent our own representatives to participate in the work of the WFTU. At that time, the trade unions in the liberated areas worked hard to improve the lives of workers, protect trade union rights, and educate and mobilize all workers to strive for their own liberation and the liberation of the people of the whole country under extremely difficult conditions. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, made great efforts to restore and develop the national economy, improve their lives, strengthen the unity of the working classes of all countries, and safeguard lasting peace in the Far East and the world, and achieved remarkable results. Now, the working class and the people of the whole country are concentrating their energy and wisdom to strive for the completion of the first five-year plan.

Lai Ruoyu concluded: As we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the WFTU, we look back on the path the WFTU has taken over the past ten years. As one of its members, we feel very honored. The Chinese trade union will continue to follow the correct policies of the WFTU, and under the banner of the international working class unity, strive to defend world peace and strive for a better future for the working class.

B.N. Mukherjee, member of the WFTU Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau, said in his speech that over the past ten years, the WFTU has raised the banner of unity and peace, and the banner of friendship among all peoples even higher. On this memorable day, let us guarantee that the achievements made in the past ten years will be further developed. Let us work together more unitedly to strive for peace, oppose war, strive for bread and a better life, and strive for freedom and a more fulfilling life.

Then, the meeting unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the World Federation of Trade Unions in the name of the meeting. The telegram said that the Beijing workers' celebration of the tenth anniversary of the World Federation of Trade Unions extends warm congratulations to the World Federation of Trade Unions and its hardworking leaders. On the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the WFTU, we vow to fight with greater labor enthusiasm to complete and overfulfill our country's first five-year plan for developing the national economy, to build our socialist new life, to strengthen the unity of the international working class, and to defend world peace.

After the celebration meeting, the Beijing Workers' Amateur Troupe performed literary and artistic programs.
