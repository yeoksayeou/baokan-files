    Opposing Obstruction of UN General Assembly Discussion on Colonial Issues

    Prior to the opening of the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, world opinion earnestly hoped that this session would make beneficial contributions to the issue of colonialism. However, under the manipulation of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly successively rejected the inclusion of the Cyprus issue and the Algerian issue on the agenda. The United Nations General Assembly also rejected the discussion of the Cyprus issue by a narrow majority. This cannot but cause great regret. Many countries, especially representatives of Asian and African countries attending the United Nations General Assembly, have expressed great dissatisfaction with this. As the Syrian representative pointed out during the UN General Assembly debate, refusing to discuss these issues would cause "great damage" to the United Nations organization.

    Both the Cyprus issue and the Algerian issue are related to the colonial peoples' demands for independence and the right to self-determination. For many years, the people of Cyprus and the people of Algeria, like other colonial peoples, have demonstrated a growing will to get rid of colonial rule and oppression with strong actions. Their demands and actions are fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. However, the British colonialists and the French colonialists stubbornly refuse to recognize their legitimate demands and have taken cruel measures to suppress their national liberation movements. As a result, an increasingly tense situation has been created in these two places, threatening peace and security in North Africa and the Mediterranean region. In accordance with the United Nations Charter's principles of maintaining human rights and respecting the self-determination of peoples and nations, as well as preventing and eliminating threats to peace, the United Nations General Assembly has every right and obligation to take appropriate measures to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Cypriot and Algerian peoples and to stop the colonialists' illegal atrocities.

    The British colonialists' position of maintaining their colonial rule in Cyprus and the French colonialists' position in Algeria are unjust and therefore cannot be sympathized with by righteous people. Therefore, they are very afraid of the United Nations organization, as an international peace institution, intervening. They tried every possible means to obstruct the United Nations General Assembly from discussing these issues. And their efforts are supported by the United States and some other colonial countries. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles even wrote to Greek Prime Minister Papagos before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly to exert pressure, attempting to coerce Greece not to bring the Cyprus issue to the United Nations General Assembly. And Donald, the U.S. Vice-Consul in Algiers, stated even earlier: "The policy of the United States has been and will continue to be to support the French in Algeria."

    These colluding colonial countries are preventing the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the Cyprus issue and the Algerian issue, which is unreasonable.

    According to the British colonialists and their supporters, the Cyprus issue seems to be outside the scope of discussion by the United Nations, and if the United Nations intervenes, it will encourage "subversive activities" and "endanger the stability of the Mediterranean." What an absurd argument. This is obviously a rude threat to the United Nations General Assembly.

    The French representative even threatened the United Nations General Assembly, saying that if the Assembly discusses the Algerian issue, it would be an "intolerable interference" in France's internal affairs, because Algeria is "part of the French mainland," a typical colonialist tone. Those familiar with history know that Algeria only became a French colony because it was conquered by the force of French colonialists. For more than a hundred years, the Algerian people have never stopped fighting to break free from the shackles of colonialism, and their will for independence can never be obliterated by the French colonialists' pretexts such as "assimilation" and "integration." Their struggle has won the sympathy of all justice-loving people. The United Nations has every reason to support the just demands of the Algerian people. Moreover, the French authorities' recent intensified bloody massacres in Algeria not only completely violate the United Nations' basic principles on human rights but also violate the most basic humanitarian spirit; there is no doubt that they should be condemned by the United Nations. Any excuse against the United Nations General Assembly discussing the Algerian issue is untenable. Fifteen Asian and African countries have decided to raise the Algerian issue to the United Nations General Assembly again. Their demands should be taken seriously, because this demand reflects the common aspirations of Asian and African countries, and reflects the steadfast spirit of Asian and African countries in realizing and implementing the Bandung Conference resolutions.

    Opposing colonialism and advocating national independence have become the common will of all progressive humanity. In particular, Asians and Africans, who account for more than half of the world's population, almost unanimously demand the eradication of the scourge of colonialism and the end of Western countries' colonial rule in Asia and Africa. This upright call cannot be ignored by anyone. If the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly fails to discuss and resolve the Cyprus issue and the Algerian issue that have been placed before it, or even adopts an evasive attitude, then the prestige and role of the United Nations will inevitably be greatly damaged. And those colonial countries that obstruct the General Assembly from discussing these issues cannot escape the solemn condemnation of world opinion.

### 反对阻挠联大讨论殖民地问题

    反对阻挠联大讨论殖民地问题
    在第十届联合国大会开幕之前，世界舆论就殷切期望这一届大会能够在殖民地问题上作出有益的贡献。但是联合国大会的总务委员会在美、英、法等国的操纵下，先后否决了将塞浦路斯问题和阿尔及利亚问题列入议程。联合国大会也以微弱多数拒绝讨论塞浦路斯问题。这不能不令人感到极大的遗憾。许多国家，特别是亚非国家出席联合国大会的代表，已对此表示很大的不满。正如叙利亚的代表在联大辩论时所指出的，拒绝讨论这些问题，将对联合国组织造成“极大的损害”。
    塞浦路斯问题和阿尔及利亚问题都是有关殖民地人民要求独立和自决权利的问题。多年以来，塞浦路斯人民和阿尔及利亚人民同其他殖民地人民一样，用坚强的行动表示出了要求摆脱殖民统治和压迫的日益强烈的意志。他们的要求和行动完全符合于联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。但是，英国殖民者和法国殖民者却固执地拒绝承认他们的合法要求，并且采取了残酷手段来镇压他们的民族解放运动。因此在这两个地方造成了日益紧张的局势，而且威胁到了北非和地中海地区的和平和安全。联合国大会本着联合国宪章关于维护人权和尊重人民和民族自决的原则，以及防止并消除对和平威胁的原则，完全有权力同时也有义务采取适当的措施，满足塞浦路斯和阿尔及利亚人民的正当愿望，制止殖民主义者的非法暴行。
    英国殖民者要在塞浦路斯和法国殖民者要在阿尔及利亚维持其殖民统治的立场是非正义的，因而是得不到正义人类的同情的。所以他们十分害怕作为国际和平机构的联合国组织出面干预。他们千方百计阻挠联合国大会讨论这些问题。而他们的努力，得到美国和其他一些殖民国家的支持。美国国务卿杜勒斯甚至在联合国大会开幕之前，就写信给希腊首相贝贝格斯施加压力，企图胁迫希腊不要把塞浦路斯问题向联合国大会提出。而美国驻阿尔及尔副领事唐纳德在更早一些时候也公开声称：“美国的政策过去是而且将来仍然是支持法国人驻在阿尔及利亚的政策”。
    这些勾结在一起的殖民国家阻止联合国大会讨论塞浦路斯问题和阿尔及利亚问题，是毫无道理的。
    根据英国殖民者和他们的支持者的说法，仿佛塞浦路斯问题是在联合国讨论范围以外的事情，联合国如果予以过问，就是鼓励“颠覆活动”，并“将危害地中海的安定”。这是何等荒谬的论调。这显然是对联合国大会的粗暴威胁。
    法国代表更恫吓联合国大会说，如果大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题就是对法国内政的“不可容忍的干涉”，理由是：阿尔及利亚是“法国本土的一部分”，好一副殖民主义者的口气。熟悉历史的人都知道，阿尔及利亚只是因为被法国殖民者的武力征服才成为了法国的殖民地。一百多年以来阿尔及利亚人民从来没有停止过为挣脱殖民主义枷锁而斗争，他们的独立意志绝不是法国殖民者拿“同化”、“合并”一类幌子所能抹煞的。他们的斗争得到一切主张正义的人民的同情。联合国完全有理由给予阿尔及利亚人民的正义要求以支持。而法国当局最近在阿尔及利亚进行变本加厉的血腥屠杀，不仅完全违背了联合国关于人权的基本原则，而且违犯了最起码的人道精神；毫无疑问，应当受到联合国的谴责。任何反对联合国大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题的借口都是站不住脚的。十五个亚非国家已决定再向联合国大会提出阿尔及利亚问题。它们的要求应受到重视，因为这一要求反映了亚非各国的共同愿望，反映了亚非国家为实现和贯彻万隆会议决议的坚韧精神。
    反对殖民主义和主张民族独立，已经成为一切进步人类的共同意志。特别是占全世界人口一半以上的亚洲和非洲人，几乎是一致地要求根除殖民主义的祸害，结束西方国家在亚非地区的殖民统治。这种正直的呼声，是任何人都不能忽视的。如果第十届联合国大会不能够按照各国人民的愿望来讨论和解决已摆在它面前的塞浦路斯问题和阿尔及利亚问题或者甚至采取规避的态度，那末，联合国的威信和作用必然要大受损害。而那些阻挠联大讨论这些问题的殖民国家，是无法逃避世界舆论的严正谴责的。
