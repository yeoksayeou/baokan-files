Xinhua News Agency:

    The Shanghai Third Steel Plant saved more than 400,000 yuan in July and August, completing more than 51% of its savings target for the second half of the year. August was the month with the best implementation of the state plan this year for the factory, with both steel production and quality exceeding the state plan, and various types of steel exceeding the state plan targets.

    The steelmaking workers at the factory also implemented a series of measures to improve quality and applied advanced experiences from other factories in the labor emulation drive, ensuring that the chemical composition of all steel ingots met standards in August. The steel rolling workers not only incorporated the savings targets into the workshop operation plan but also implemented them into the daily economic accounting of the work teams. Workers in each work team launched competitions around the economic accounting indicators. Workers in the steel casting section of the foundry workshop appropriately mixed used sand with new sand, utilizing more than 90 tons of waste sand in just over a month, saving more than 2,900 yuan.

    上海第三钢厂下半年节约计划完成一半多
    上海第三钢厂七、八两个月共节约四十万多元，完成了下半年节约指标的百分之五十一以上。八月份是这个厂今年以来执行国家计划较好的一个月，钢的产量和质量都超过了国家计划，各种品种的钢材也都分别超额完成了国家计划。
    这个厂的炼钢工人们还在劳动竞赛中贯彻了一系列提高质量的措施和运用了别厂的先进经验，使八月份钢锭的化学成分全部合格。轧钢工人们的节约指标不仅订进车间作业计划，而且贯彻到每天的班组经济核算中去。围绕经济核算指标，各班组的工人互相展开了竞赛。铸造车间铸钢工段工人把用过的砂和新砂适当搭配起来使用，一个多月就利用了九十多吨废砂，节约二千九百多元。
