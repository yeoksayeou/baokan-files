Sichuan is transporting large quantities of grain stored in mountainous areas
    This year, Sichuan Province has transported a large quantity of grain accumulated in mountainous and remote areas out of the province.

    Due to inconvenient transportation, grain could not be transported out of these areas, resulting in large grain reserves over the years. Farmers had a lot of old grain that they could not sell, which affected the improvement of their living standards. In Xiushan, Youyang, and other counties in the southeastern corner of Sichuan, a large amount of old grain from 1949 was still stored in 1953. In order to help farmers with their production, the state purchased some grain in these areas, but because it was stored for too long, it often became moldy. Some places used it for brewing wine and making sugar, resulting in great waste.

    In order to promote the export of grain from these dead-end areas, the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee built highways, repaired waterways, and connected the mountainous areas to the province's transportation arteries. After the renovation of the Minjiang River and its tributaries this year, the Minjiang River trunk line from Yibin to Leshan has been opened to ships. With the improvement of land transportation, the amount of grain exported from more than ten relatively remote counties in the Leshan area increased by 3.9 times from January to August this year compared with the same period last year. A large amount of dead-end grain in more than ten counties in the Nanchong area has also been transported out this year. Yilong County transported out more than 14 million catties of old grain from two or three years ago. Dazhu, Dazu, and Dianjiang counties, which were originally difficult to transport surplus grain from, have now also transported out a large amount of surplus grain. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川运出大量山区存粮
    四川省山区和边远地区积存的粮食，今年大量运出省外。
    这些地区由于交通不便，粮食运不出，历年存粮很多。农民有很多陈粮卖不出去，影响生活的改善。四川东南角的秀山、酉阳等县，在一九五三年还储存着一九四九年的大量陈粮。国家为了扶助农民进行生产，在这些地区收购的一部分粮食，也因储存过久，往往发生霉变，有些地方用来酿酒熬糖，浪费很大。
    四川省人民委员会为促使这些地区的死角粮外运，修筑公路，整修航道，连结了山区和省内运输要道。岷江和岷江支流的航道今年整修后，宜宾到乐山段的岷江干线已通轮船。加上陆路交通的改善，乐山专区十多个较偏僻的县，今年一月到八月和去年同期比较，粮食外运量增加了三点九倍。南充专区十多个县的死角粮今年也大量外运。仪陇县把两三年前的陈粮运出了一千四百多万斤。原来余粮很难运出的产米区大足、大竹、垫江等县，现在都也已运出大量余粮。　（新华社）
