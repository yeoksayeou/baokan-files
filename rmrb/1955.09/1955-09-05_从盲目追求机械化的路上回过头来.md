    Turning Back From the Road of Blindly Pursuing Mechanization
    By Our Correspondent Fan Rongkang
    In early 1955, the Lingxi Vertical Shaft, newly built by the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau, went into production. The miners couldn't contain their joy.
  Only one person felt a bit guilty amidst the happiness. That person was Cheng Yizhi, Deputy Chief of the Mechanical Manufacturing Section of the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute.
    Cheng Yizhi and his colleagues in the Mechanical Manufacturing Section of the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute had put a lot of effort into the design of the Lingxi Vertical Shaft. At the time, they were very enthusiastic, or perhaps it could be said, very satisfied with one thing: they had designed the car pushers and car stoppers for the auxiliary shaft's wellhead yard, making the entire yard mechanized.
    At that time, in many coal mines in Northeast China, except for two mines in Fushun and Benxi that had car pushers and car stoppers installed, the auxiliary shaft wellhead yards in other mines were all operated manually. The comrades in the Mechanical Manufacturing Section believed that they were designing a socialist enterprise, which should be "built on the most advanced technological foundation," and they were determined to use mechanized equipment to replace manual operation.
    This task was assigned to a specially organized group. They saw car pushers and car stoppers on blueprints designed by the Soviets for other mines. However, the construction drawings had not yet arrived, and they did not know what the structure of the car pushers and car stoppers was, so they couldn't design them. Later, they found a schematic diagram of pneumatic car pushers and car stoppers in a book titled "General Layout of Mine Surface Industrial Equipment" borrowed from the Northeast Library. The comrades in the group were very happy and dedicated themselves to designing for more than a year, finally completing the task.
    The Fuxin Mining Bureau General Machinery Plant undertook the manufacturing of this new product. The workers encountered many difficulties in manufacturing these unfamiliar products. The two-meter-long cylinder was made of two cast pieces joined together, and it was extremely difficult to machine the tolerances of these two pieces to be exactly the same! Moreover, it was almost impossible to control such long castings on the lathe. However, the workers overcame these difficulties in order to support basic construction.
    The car pushers and car stoppers were installed in the Lingxi Vertical Shaft. So many days and nights of brainstorming, so many people's hard work, had finally yielded this set of mechanized equipment. However, during the test run, an unexpected event occurred. As soon as the air valve was opened, the violent air caused the car pusher to exert a powerful impact. The mine car was pushed open, and the steel cable on the car pusher was immediately broken.
    The car pushers and car stoppers had to be shelved, and the mine decided to use manual operation instead.
    Cheng Yizhi was of course not willing to admit defeat. A few days before the mine went into production, he personally went to test them. This time, as soon as the air valve was opened, the car pusher pushed the mine car into the cage, and the pusher pawl got stuck in the concrete floor next to the shaft. The car pusher could not retract, and even the cage was stuck and could not descend. People rushed over to pull with ropes and hit with hammers, but the pusher pawl was stuck there, unmoving. Finally, after clearing the concrete and soil around the shaft, the car pusher retracted.
    Clearly, this set of mechanized equipment was more troublesome and worrisome than the manual operation of automatic gliding. Later, after Soviet experts looked at the design drawings of the auxiliary shaft wellhead yard of the Lingxi Vertical Shaft, they also said: "The Soviet Union does not have this kind of car pusher and car stopper. Over there, the car pusher is electric, and the car stopper is manual, and the actions are very accurate."
      Thus, on the day the Lingxi Vertical Shaft went into production, people saw the miners pushing mine cars full of gangue into the cage by hand, just like their brothers in many other mines.
    "Yes, there are problems with the design. It is not feasible to design by simply copying from books." Cheng Yizhi thought this as he returned from the celebration of the transfer to production: "However, in any case, it is mechanized equipment, it is advanced. The mine should repair the machines and use them!"
    However, all the way until he left the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau, that set of car pushers and car stoppers had not been repaired.
    Winter passed. The comrades who returned from the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau told Cheng Yizhi that the mine was still pushing cars manually.
    A vague understanding gradually appeared in Cheng Yizhi's mind. It seemed that not having car pushers and car stoppers did not affect the mine's production. He began to feel that there was a more serious error in the design of the Lingxi Vertical Shaft's auxiliary shaft wellhead yard than simply copying from books; this was that they had designed equipment that was not needed in mine production.
    This vague understanding was confirmed during the recent organization of all personnel in the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute to study Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the All-Soviet Construction Workers Conference, to study Comrade Li Fuchun's report on "Practicing Strict Economy and Striving to Complete Socialist Construction," and to implement the central government's instructions on reducing the cost of basic construction. The Mechanical Manufacturing Section calculated the cost of the design of the Lingxi Vertical Shaft's auxiliary shaft wellhead yard in this study, which shocked people.
    The calculation was as follows: the Lingxi Vertical Shaft transported about 50 mine cars up and down the auxiliary shaft every day. If car pushers and car stoppers were used (of course, referring to car pushers and car stoppers that operated accurately), one mine car could be transported every minute. Calculated on a two-shift basis per day, the utilization rate of the mechanical equipment would not exceed 10 percent. That's the first point. Second, the construction of this set of mechanized equipment cost more than 100,000 yuan. If the method of automatic gliding was adopted, this huge investment could be saved. Third, using car pushers and car stoppers would involve high costs in daily production and would require two or three workers to operate, while the method of automatic gliding would also require only three to five workers, the cost is low, and it is not very difficult to operate by using the slope of the railway to glide automatically. Fourth, pneumatic car pushers and car stoppers often malfunction.
    Therefore, the conclusion is: today, in a medium-sized mine like the Lingxi Vertical Shaft, in the auxiliary shaft wellhead of a secondary production system, simply in order to lift a limited quantity of gangue, which itself has no value, it is unnecessary to spend such a large investment and the labor of so many people to build fully mechanized equipment.
    It is painful to admit this fact. Cheng Yizhi and many others who participated in this design did not expect that they would make such a mistake. In fact, this error was inevitable; it was destined to happen from the moment they started designing. Because the advanced nature of the design that they were thinking about at the time was only technical advancement, but they did not know that technical advancement must not be separated from economic rationality. They did not know that achieving the greatest economic effect with the least investment is the expression of socialist design thinking. Separated from economic rationality, not based on the actual needs of production, not considering the country's economic conditions, the technical level of industry, and other actual conditions, pursuing "full mechanization" is committing a blind error.
    Mistakes like the design of the auxiliary shaft wellhead yard of the Lingxi Vertical Shaft can be found in many places in the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute. Also in the design of this Lingxi Vertical Shaft, the designers once intended to use a large investment to build a set of mechanized coal feeding and ash removal equipment for a very small boiler room, including chain conveyors, scraper conveyors, belt conveyors, and a coal storage cellar with a vast project like a steel-structured bridge; and building this set of mechanized equipment was only to save five or six boiler workers. In the design of a small well—the Lingxi Eight Inclined Shaft—with reserves of only 1.6 million tons and a mining life of only twelve years, the designers forgot that the reason the state built these small wells was because they required less investment, had a shorter construction period, and produced coal quickly, and they stubbornly put highly mechanized equipment on this small well. They intended to use an investment of more than 200,000 yuan to build a large-scale, fully mechanized coal storage yard for the Lingxi Eight Inclined Shaft. However, the daily output of the Lingxi Eight Inclined Shaft was only a few hundred tons. This means that the coal produced by this mine every day only requires a train with twenty wagons to haul it away. Direct loading, coupled with some simple measures, can avoid building a mechanized coal storage yard. Several existing small wells adjacent to the Lingxi Eight Inclined Shaft have solved the problem in exactly the same way. In the design of the Yin Kuang Shan Inclined Shaft, the designers intended to spend an investment of about 200,000 yuan to build a mechanized gangue mountain to dispose of gangue. However, gangue, as everyone knows, is waste from the mine, and most mines across the country use the slope of natural terrain to dispose of gangue, and normal production is not affected in any way. In the five large and medium-sized mines designed by the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, all are equipped with automatic block signals, but some mines only have two electric locomotives in operation, making it impossible for collisions to occur.
    All of these, as it seems today, are such obvious wastes; but in the beginning, many designers at the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute could not have imagined this. All they thought about was "high mechanization" or "full mechanization." They flipped through books, copied foreign designs, and were proud of using the most machines in their designs; some designers even openly called themselves "textbook technicians." In this wave of blindly pursuing mechanization, there was also buried the individualistic idea of masterpieces of some designers. They always wanted to show off their skills and design superhuman works. Naturally, in the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, some people had fought against these phenomena of wasting state investment, and some people had carefully calculated the economic effects in their designs and adopted mechanized equipment more appropriately; but this correct thinking and practice did not receive due attention at the time. Some designers even criticized this design for having too low a degree of mechanization and accused this design of being "simply primitive."
    In this study, after in-depth inspection and criticism, the thinking of the designers has taken a step forward. The concept of economy has begun to be established. They have begun to clarify that even in the heavy industry sector of the coal mining industry, there are still distinctions between key projects and general projects. The mines designed with the help of the Soviet Union are key projects for coal mine construction; copying foreign designs and applying the mechanization standards of key projects to general projects eliminates the focus and violates the policy of focusing on key construction. They have also begun to clarify that even in productive construction, there are distinctions between the main production system and the secondary production system, and that in design, limited funds should be concentrated on the construction of the main production system to ensure the technical advancement of the main production system; as for the construction of secondary production systems such as the auxiliary shaft's wellhead yard and gangue disposal, efforts should be made to save money. They have also begun to clarify that even in the main production system of the coal mining industry, it is necessary to calculate the actual needs of production based on the size of the mine, the type of shaft (vertical or inclined), the amount of output, and the length of the mining life to adopt mechanized equipment; blindly pursuing mechanization is also wrong.
    Based on these understandings, the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute has formulated measures for saving. Taking these measures, and using these measures to revise some of the designs that can still be revised, will save the state more than 7 million yuan in investment in the second half of this year, accounting for more than 10 percent of the total investment in the design projects they undertake throughout the year. Due to the adoption of these measures, overcoming the error of blindly pursuing mechanization can also save a part of unnecessary design workload, equipment manufacturing time, and construction workload, which can better ensure the construction speed of the coal mining industry.

### 从盲目追求机械化的路上回过头来

专栏：厉行全面节约，克服一切浪费

    从盲目追求机械化的路上回过头来
    本报记者　范荣康
    一九五五年年初，双鸭山矿务局新建的岭西竖井投入生产了。矿工们都抑制不住心头的高兴。
  只有一个人，在高兴中感到有一些内疚。这个人就是沈阳煤矿设计院机械制造科副科长成一之。
    成一之和沈阳煤矿设计院机械制造科的同志们为岭西竖井的设计花费了不少心血。当时，他们很热心，或者也可以说是很满意的一件事，就是设计了副井井口车场的推车机和阻车机，使得副井井口车场全盘机械化了。
    那时，在东北的许多煤矿上，除了抚顺和本溪有两个矿井设置了推车机和阻车机以外，其他矿井的副井井口车场都是用人工操作的。机械制造科的同志们认为自己是在设计一个社会主义企业，应该“建筑在最先进的技术基础上”，决心用机械化的设备来代替人工操作。
    这个任务交付给一个专门组织起来的小组。他们从苏联给其他矿井设计的图纸上看到了推车机和阻车机。但是当时施工图还没有来，他们不知道推车机和阻车机的构造究竟是怎样的，还是没法设计。后来，他们从东北图书馆借来的一本“矿井地面工业设备总布置”上，找到了风动推车机和阻车机示意图。小组的同志们十分高兴，专心一致地设计了一年多，终于完成了任务。
    阜新矿务局总机厂承制了这件新产品。制造这些陌生的产品，工人们遇到了不少困难。两公尺多长的汽缸是用两段铸件接成的，要把这两段活儿的公差车得一模一样是多么不容易啊！而且车床上简直没法控制这么长的铸件。但是工人们为了支援基本建设，把这些困难都克服了。
    推车机和阻车机在岭西竖井安好了。多少昼夜的苦思，多少人的辛劳，才换来了这一套机械化的设备。可是，在试运转的时候，发生了意外的事情。汽阀刚一开放，猛烈的空气使推车机发出强大的冲击力。矿车被顶开了，推车机上的钢丝绳一下就被折断了。
    推车机和阻车机只好被打进冷宫，矿上决定还是用人工操作。
    成一之当然不甘心失败。投入生产的前几天，他亲自去试验。这一次，汽阀一开，推车机把矿车顶进罐笼，推车爪就卡在井筒旁的水泥地里，推车机退不回去，连罐笼也给卡住不能下降了。人们跑来用绳子拉，用铁锤打，推车爪还是卡在那儿，一动也不动。最后，把井筒旁的水泥和土块扒净，推车机才退回去了。
    显然，这套机械化的设备比起自动滑行的手工操作来，更费事，更令人操心。后来，苏联专家看了岭西竖井副井井口车场的设计图纸后，也说：“苏联没有这种推车机和阻车机。在我们那儿，推车机是电动的，阻车机是手动的，动作非常准确。”
      这样，到岭西竖井投入生产的那天，人们看到矿工们正像其他许多矿井里的弟兄们一样，用手推着满装矸石的矿车，送到罐笼里去。
    “是的，设计是有问题，照抄书本来设计是不行的。”从庆祝移交生产的大会上回来，成一之这样想：“可是，无论如何毕竟是机械化设备，是先进的，矿上总该把机器修理一下用上呵！”
    可是，一直到他离开双鸭山矿务局，那一套推车机和阻车机还没有修理。
    冬天过去了。从双鸭山矿务局回来的同志们告诉成一之，矿上还是用人工推车。
    一种模模糊糊的认识逐渐在成一之的脑子里出现，看来，没有推车机和阻车机，并不影响矿里的生产。他开始感到岭西竖井副井井口车场的设计中，还有比照抄书本更严重的错误；这就是他们设计了矿井生产中并不需要的设备。
    这种模模糊糊的认识，在沈阳煤矿设计院最近组织全院人员学习赫鲁晓夫同志在全苏建筑工作人员会议上的讲话，学习李富春同志“厉行节约，为完成社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告和贯彻中央关于降低基本建设造价的指示时，才被肯定下来。机械制造科在这次学习中替岭西竖井副井井口车场的设计算了一笔账，使人们大吃一惊。
    这笔账是这样的：岭西竖井每天通过副井上下的矿车约五十台次，如果使用推车机和阻车机的话
  （当然是指动作准确的推车机和阻车机），每一分钟可以运送一个矿车，每天按两班计算，机械设备的利用率不会超过百分之十。这是第一。第二，建设这套机械化的设备，共投资十多万元，如果采用自动滑行的办法，可以节省这笔巨额投资。第三，使用推车机和阻车机，在日常生产中要付出很高的成本费用，还需要两三个工人操作，而采用自动滑行的办法，也只需要三、五个工人，成本低，并且利用铁路的坡度自动滑行，操作起来也不是很费事的。第四，风动推车机和阻车机还常常使换不灵。
    因此，结论是：在今天，在岭西竖井这样一个规模不大的中型矿井里，在次要生产系统的副井井口，仅仅为了提升数量有限、并且本身没有什么价值的矸石，花费这样大的投资，这样多人的劳动，去建设全盘机械化的设备，是没有必要的。
    要承认这个事实是痛苦的。成一之和参加这项设计的其他许多人都没有想到他们会犯这样的错误。其实，这个错误是必然的，在他们开始设计时就已注定了要发生的。因为当时他们所想的设计的先进性，就只是技术上的先进，却不知道技术的先进性决不能离开经济的合理性。他们不知道以最少的投资发挥最大的经济效果，才是社会主义设计思想的表现。离开了经济的合理性，不根据生产的实际需要，不考虑国家的经济条件、工业的技术水平等实际情况，去追求“全盘机械化”，就犯了盲目性的错误。
    像岭西竖井副井井口车场设计的错误，在沈阳煤矿设计院还可以找到许多。也就在这个岭西竖井的设计中，设计人员曾打算用很大一笔投资，去为一座很小的锅炉房建设一套机械化的进煤出灰设备，其中包括锁链式运输机、刮板运输机、皮带运输机，还有一座工程浩大得有如钢结构的桥梁一样的储煤地窖；而建设这样一套机械化的设备只是为了节省五、六个锅炉工人。在一个埋藏量只有一百六十多万吨，开采年限只有十二年的小井——岭西八斜井的设计中，设计人员忘记了国家所以建设这些小井，是因为小井投资少、建设期限短、出煤快，也硬把高度机械化的设备架在这座小井身上。他们打算用二十多万元的投资，为岭西八斜井建设一个规模很大的、全盘机械化的贮煤场。而岭西八斜井的日产量只有几百吨。这就是说：这个矿井每天所产的煤只需要一列挂二十个车皮的火车就可以拉完，用直接装车的办法，再加上一些简单的措施，是可以不建机械化的贮煤场的。紧靠岭西八斜井的几个现有的小井，正是用同样的办法解决了问题。在银矿山斜井的设计中，设计人员曾打算花二十万元左右的投资，建设机械化的矸石山来处理矸石。而矸石，正如大家所知道的，是矿井里的废物，全国大多数矿井都是利用自然地形的坡度来处理矸石，正常生产也并不受什么影响。在沈阳煤矿设计院设计的五个大中型矿井里，全部装置了自动闭塞信号，可是有的矿井里总共只有两部电机车运转，根本不可能发生碰车的事情。
    所有这些，在今天看来，是多么明显的浪费；可是当初，沈阳煤矿设计院许多设计人员是想不到这一点的。他们所想的只是“高度机械化”或者是“全盘机械化”。他们翻书本，抄国外设计，以自己的设计中采用的机械最多而骄傲；甚至有的设计人员公然自称是“书本技术员”。在这种盲目追求机械化的热潮中，还埋藏着一部分设计人员个人主义的杰作思想。他们总想借此露一手，设计出超人的作品来。自然，在沈阳煤矿设计院里也曾有人同这些浪费国家投资的现象作过斗争，也曾有人在自己的设计中，严谨地计算过经济效果，比较恰当地采用了机械化设备；但这种正确的思想和作法当时并没有得到应有的重视。甚至有的设计人员反来批评这种设计机械化程度太低，指责这种设计“简直是原始状况”。
    在这一次学习中，经过深入的检查和批判，设计人员的思想提高了一步。节约的观点开始树立起来。他们开始明确：即使是在煤矿工业这个重工业部门中，也还有重点工程同一般工程的区别。苏联帮助我国设计的矿井是煤矿建设的重点工程；照抄国外设计，把重点工程的机械化标准搬用到一般工程上来，就没有了重点，违反了重点建设的方针。他们也开始明确：即使是在生产性建设中，还有主要生产系统同次要生产系统的区别，在设计中应该把有限的资金集中使用在主要生产系统的建设上，保证主要生产系统技术上的先进；至于副井的井口车场、矸石处理等次要生产系统的建设，应该力求节省。他们也开始明确：即使是在煤矿工业的主要生产系统中，也必须根据大井、小井、竖井、斜井、产量多少、开采年限多久等情况，计算生产的实际需要，来采用机械化的设备；盲目追求机械化也是错误的。
    根据这些认识，沈阳煤矿设计院制定了节约措施。采取这些措施，并且用这些措施去修改一部分还来得及修改的设计，今年下半年就可以为国家节省投资七百多万元，占他们全年承担的设计项目总投资额的百分之十以上。由于采取这些措施，克服盲目追求机械化的错误，还可以节省一部分不必要的设计工作量、设备制造的时间和施工工作量，更能保证煤矿工业的建设速度。
