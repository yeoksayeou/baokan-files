    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki: According to TASS, Finnish Republic President Paasikivi delivered a radio address in Helsinki on the evening of the 22nd regarding the results of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations.

    Paasikivi said: I am very satisfied with the concrete results that have been achieved. I am also very satisfied with what I had the opportunity to see in Moscow. During this visit, my entourage and I, through many talks with the Soviet leaders, perceived a very good political atmosphere toward Finland and great sympathy for Finland.

    The Soviet Union has relinquished its lease rights and other rights to the Porkkala-Udd area and returned it to Finland. This is a particularly important matter for us. This once again proves that friendly negotiations and rational consultations are the path to follow in resolving issues between us and the Soviet Union.

    In discussing the extension of the validity period of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, signed on April 6, 1948, for twenty years, Paasikivi pointed out that this friendship treaty affirms Finland's desire to remain outside the conflicting interests of the major powers. Articles 1 and 2 of this treaty stipulate that if Finland becomes the target of military aggression or if the Soviet Union becomes the target of military aggression through Finnish territory, Finland shall do its utmost to protect the inviolability of its territory, and consultations must be held if both parties believe that Finland is indeed threatened by military aggression. These provisions are based on the current situation and will not endanger Finland's position.

    Paasikivi concluded: Our relationship with the Soviet Union is the most important issue in our foreign policy, and this relationship has improved year by year during the implementation of the friendship treaty. I hope, and I also believe, that the agreements that have been signed and will soon be submitted to Parliament for discussion and approval will consolidate this positive development.

    巴锡基维就芬苏谈判结果发表广播演说
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰共和国总统巴锡基维二十二日晚间就苏芬谈判的结果在赫尔辛基发表了广播演说。
    巴锡基维说：我很满意已经达成的具体结果。我也很满意我有机会在莫斯科看到的情况。在这次访问当中，我和我的随行人员从同苏联的领导人物的许多次会谈中，看出了对芬兰的非常良好的政治气氛和对芬兰的莫大的同情。
    苏联放弃了波卡拉乌德地区的租借权和其他权利，并且将它归还给芬兰。这对我们来说是一件特别重要的事情。这再一次证明：友好的谈判和理智的协商是解决我们和苏联之间的问题时所应遵循的道路。
    在谈到延长一九四八年四月六日签订的苏芬友好合作互助条约有效期间二十年的问题时，巴锡基维指出，这个友好条约肯定了芬兰置身于各大国之间的利益矛盾之外的愿望。这个条约的第一条和第二条规定，如果芬兰成为军事侵略的目标或是苏联成为通过芬兰领土而来的军事侵略的目标，芬兰就应当尽它的力量来保护它的领土的不可侵犯性，而且，在双方认为芬兰的确有受到军事侵犯的威胁时必须进行协商。这些规定都是以现在的局势为出发点的，而且不会使芬兰的地位遭受危险。
    巴锡基维最后说：我们同苏联的关系是我们的对外政策的最重要的问题，这种关系在实行友好条约期间一年比一年好起来。我希望，而且我也相信，即将提交国会讨论和通过的已经签订的协定会巩固这种良好的发展。
