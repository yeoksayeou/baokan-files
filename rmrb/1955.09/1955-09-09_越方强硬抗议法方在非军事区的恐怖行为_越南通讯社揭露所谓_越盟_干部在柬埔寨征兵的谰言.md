Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 8th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 7th, the Vietnamese People's Army delegation of the Vietnam Demilitarized Zone Joint Armistice Commission strongly protested at the meeting on September 3rd against the French side's renewed intrusion into Ganpu Village in the demilitarized zone to commit terrorist acts, and demanded that a joint team be sent for on-the-spot investigation.

Two rows of armed police of the South Vietnamese regime, with the connivance of the French Federal forces, rushed into the demilitarized zone on September 1st and surrounded Ganpu Village in the southern part of the demilitarized zone. They searched for former resistance personnel, savagely beat residents, robbed residents of their property, and took away eight civilians.

On the same night, more than a hundred other armed police once again invaded and searched Ganpu Village. These armed police used rifle butts to wake up many sleeping elderly people and children and interrogated them. Finally, they took away forty-five residents.

In August, armed police in South Vietnam had repeatedly invaded Ganpu Village to carry out similar terrorist activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 8th: According to recent news from Phnom Penh, "Viet Minh" cadres are recruiting local youths in the Bapu area of Battambang Province. The Chief of General Staff of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, Lon Nol, has arrived in the area to take all necessary countermeasures.

The Vietnam News Agency pointed out in a telegram published on the 8th that the purpose of the above statement is obviously to undermine the Cambodian general election at a time when the election campaign is in full swing in Cambodia. As is known to all, during the War of Resistance, Battambang Province was one of the bases for the Khmer resistance forces, and the people's movement in this province is quite strong. General public opinion believes that, in addition to wantonly slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, pro-American elements in Cambodia also want to find an excuse to carry out terrorist rule over former resistance personnel in Cambodia and suppress candidates from hostile groups. The purpose of this approach is also to suppress Cambodian patriots who have been demanding that the Royal Cambodian Government guarantee free general elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords and the Cambodian Constitution.

    越方强硬抗议法方在非军事区的恐怖行为
    越南通讯社揭露所谓“越盟”干部在柬埔寨征兵的谰言
    新华社河内八日电据越南通讯社七日讯：越南非军事区联合停战委员会的越南人民军代表团在九月三日的会议上，强硬抗议法方再次侵入非军事区甘铺村进行恐怖行为，并且要求派一个联合小组前往进行实地调查。
    南越政权的两排武装警察在法兰西联邦部队的纵容下，在九月一日冲进非军事区，包围了非军事区南部的甘铺村。他们搜捕前抗战人员，野蛮地毒打居民，抢劫居民的财物，并且抓走了八个平民。
    同一天晚上，一百多个另外的武装警察再一次侵入并且搜查了甘铺村。这些武装警察用枪托打醒了许多正在熟睡的老人和儿童，加以拷问。最后，他们带走了四十五个居民。
    在八月间，南越的武装警察已经多次侵入甘铺村进行了类似的恐怖活动。
    新华社河内八日电据最近从金边传出消息说，“越盟”干部在马德望省巴普来地区征召当地青年入伍。柬埔寨王国军队参谋总长朗诺已经来到这个地区，以便采取一切必要的对付措施。
    越南通讯社在八日发表的电讯中指出：在竞选运动正在柬埔寨全面展开的时候，上述说法的目的显然是要破坏柬埔寨普选。大家知道，在抗战期间，马德望省是高棉抗战部队的根据地之一，人民运动在这个省份是相当强大的。一般舆论认为：柬埔寨的亲美人士除了对越南民主共和国大肆诬蔑之外，还想要找到借口来对柬埔寨前抗战人员实行恐怖统治，并且对敌对集团的候选人进行镇压。这种做法的目的还在于镇压柬埔寨的爱国者，他们一直在要求柬埔寨王国政府保证遵照日内瓦协定和柬埔寨宪法举行自由普选。
