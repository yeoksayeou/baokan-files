Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th. Hubei Province has decided to increase the number of agricultural production cooperatives from the existing 14,000+ to over 70,000 from this winter to next autumn. Every township in the province will, based on this decision and its own situation, formulate a plan within one month for developing agricultural production cooperatives this winter and spring. Some of the more advanced townships will also formulate plans for the cooperativization movement up to 1957. In these townships, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives will reach about 55% by the autumn of 1957.

Recently, Party committees at all levels in Hubei Province have sent responsible cadres to key townships to assist township branches in gaining experience in "overall planning." Approximately 20,000 cadres transferred from various provincial-level organizations will also assist in carrying out this work.

Currently, various regions in Hubei Province are formulating comprehensive cooperativization plans. Based on the recent instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee has decided to expand its original plan of establishing 6,500 cooperatives from this winter to next autumn to establishing 15,000 cooperatives.

More than 85% of Hubei Province's existing 14,000+ agricultural production cooperatives increased production this year, and the vast majority of cooperative members increased their income. Agricultural production cooperatives in the areas along the Yangtze River that were affected by major floods last year achieved even greater harvests this year than in 1953. Early and mid-season rice generally increased production by 10% to 20%, which greatly encouraged the surrounding peasants to take the socialist road. In the past month or so, over 60,000 peasant households in Zhaoyang and Yicheng counties in the Xiangyang area have verbally or in writing applied to join cooperatives during the deliberation of overall plans. More than 380 mutual aid teams in Zhaoyang County have also written applications to establish cooperatives. In Baiyang Township, Yichang County, the poor peasants and struggling middle peasants who recently requested to join cooperatives accounted for more than half of the peasant households outside the cooperatives in the entire township. In many places, the first batch of agricultural production cooperatives will be established by the end of September or the beginning of October, according to the agricultural cooperativization plans.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 11th. Parts of rural Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, have entered a new upsurge of the socialist mass movement; the majority of rural areas are on the eve of the upsurge. This was pointed out by a responsible comrade of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee after understanding the situation in Xiaogan County.

In order to understand the rural situation after the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the issue of agricultural cooperativization were issued, so as to strengthen the specific leadership of the cooperativization movement, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently sent a responsible comrade of the Provincial Committee to Xiaogan County to understand the specific rural situation. According to the Provincial Committee's responsible comrade's conversation with reporters: Since the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the issue of agricultural cooperativization were conveyed, the broad masses of peasants in rural Xiaogan County—especially the poor peasants and middle peasants with difficulties in their lives—were overjoyed and actively discussed joining old cooperatives and organizing new cooperatives. From many vivid examples, it can be seen that the county's rural areas are now on the eve of an upsurge in the agricultural cooperativization movement. Some villages and townships with a stronger cooperative foundation and more in-depth discussions this time have already begun to enter the climax of the movement. The poor peasants who are most eager to join agricultural production cooperatives said after hearing the transmission this time: "Chairman Mao's eyes are truly bright; he has thoroughly understood our hearts in Beijing, and our wishes can now be realized."

Xiaogan County has already established 390 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 11,000 mutual aid teams, and the organized peasants account for 56% of the county's total peasant households. Currently, many agricultural production mutual aid teams in the countryside are actively preparing to transition into cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, the county has recently formed 487 joint mutual aid groups (referred to as mutual aid joint groups). Many mutual aid joint groups are also discussing land shareholding. The peasants of Xu Yugui's mutual aid team in Friendship Township, upon hearing that class analysis methods would be adopted in this cooperative establishment, automatically asked someone to write everyone's history for them and sent it to the township branch of the Chinese Communist Party for review. Many mutual aid teams are also starting to improve labor organization, implement the "small contracting" system, and actively carry out autumn plowing and autumn planting and manure accumulation work, so as to create conditions for winning a bumper harvest after the establishment of cooperatives. Recently, the county sent staff to investigate the surrounding situation of 117 old cooperatives, and more than 1,300 poor peasant households requested to join the old cooperatives. In the past, these poor peasants were mostly subject to exclusion. After hearing the spirit of the central government's instructions this time, they happily and actively prepared cooperative shares and automatically sent them to the cooperative to request acceptance. Zhang Jiaxun, a poor peasant in Democracy Township, sent all 15 yuan from selling surplus grain to the cooperative as shares, requesting approval for him to be a member of the cooperative. Under the new situation of the increasingly approaching climax of cooperativization, many middle peasants who had previously adopted a cold and wait-and-see attitude towards the cooperativization movement have also begun to actively request to join cooperatives under the influence of the poor peasants. According to the analysis of survey materials, among the peasants in rural Xiaogan County who are currently actively requesting to join cooperatives, those in advanced townships with a better work foundation account for 40% to 50% of the total peasant households, those in general townships account for about 30%, and those in backward townships with a poor work foundation also account for more than 20% of the total peasant households.

The responsible comrade of the Provincial Committee emphasized in the conversation: This new situation in rural Xiaogan is representative to a certain extent in Hubei Province. However, it should be pointed out that, according to the situation learned this time, although our rural workers have improved their ideological level and overcome right-leaning emotions to a certain extent after studying the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the issue of agricultural cooperativization, and have made a lot of preparations for welcoming the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the leadership is still lagging behind the masses compared to the high enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to take the road of cooperativization. The prominent problem among them is that many people still have not correctly and immediately used class analysis methods, grasped the rural situation, carried out cooperative establishment planning well, and selected cooperative establishment targets well. The result of this will cause the movement to be blind, self-flowing and chaotic, thereby leaving loopholes for rich peasant elements and counter-revolutionary elements to sabotage the movement. In individual townships in Xiaogan, the fact that rich peasant elements manipulated middle peasants to come forward and attempt to organize fake cooperatives has already occurred.

He also pointed out: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has recently issued instructions to party organizations at all levels in rural areas throughout the province based on the development of the movement, requiring all localities to continue to criticize right-leaning ideology, and leading cadres must personally go deep into the townships in conjunction with the "three fixings" work, use class analysis methods, grasp the situation well, regard cooperative establishment planning as the key link in leading the current agricultural cooperativization movement, and strictly prevent the occurrence of self-flowing and chaotic phenomena in the movement. This instruction also emphasized that the objects of cooperative establishment must be carefully reviewed and selected, training of cooperative establishment backbones must be organized in a timely manner, great attention must be paid to cherishing the enthusiasm of the peasants for taking the socialist road, and at the same time, vigilance must be improved, and enemies must be strictly prevented from sabotaging the movement, so as to lead the cooperativization movement forward healthily.

### 湖北各地制定全面农业合作化规划  孝感县农业合作化运动即将进入高潮

    湖北各地制定全面农业合作化规划
    孝感县农业合作化运动即将进入高潮
    新华社武汉八日电　湖北省已决定从今冬到明年秋前把农业生产合作社由现有的一万四千多个发展到七万多个。全省每一个乡都将根据这个决定和本乡情况，在一个月内订出今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的计划。部分较先进的乡还将订出到一九五七年的合作化运动的规划，这些乡到一九五七年秋前，入社农户将达到百分之五十五左右。
    中共湖北省各级党委最近都已派出负责干部深入重点乡，协助乡支部取得“全面规划”的经验。全省各级机关抽调下乡的两万名左右的干部也将协助开展这项工作。
    现在，湖北省各地都在订全面的合作化规划。襄阳地委根据最近中共中央指示的精神，决定把原订的今冬到明年秋前建社六千五百个的计划扩大为建社一万五千个。
    湖北省现有的一万四千多个农业生产合作社今年百分之八十五以上都增了产，绝大部分社员增加了收入，长江两岸去年大水地区的农业生产合作社今年得到比一九五三年更大的丰收，早、中稻普遍增产一成到二成，这就大大鼓舞了周围农民走社会主义道路的积极性。一个多月来，襄阳专区枣阳、宜城等县在酝酿全面规划中，已有六万多农户口头或书面申请入社。枣阳县还有三百八十多个互助组写了建社申请书。宜昌县白羊乡最近要求入社的贫农和有困难的中农，就占全乡社外农户的一半以上。许多地方在九月底、十月初即将根据农业合作化的规划，建立起第一批农业生产合作社。
    新华社武汉十一日电　湖北省孝感县部分农村已进入新的社会主义群众运动的高潮；大部分农村正处在高潮前夕。这是中共湖北省委负责同志到孝感县了解后指出的。
    为了了解中共中央关于农业合作化问题的指示下达后的农村情况，以便加强对合作化运动的具体领导，中共湖北省委员会最近特派省委负责同志到孝感县了解农村具体情况。据省委负责同志对记者谈：自从中共中央关于农业合作化问题的指示传达以后，孝感县农村广大农民群众——特别是贫农和生活上有困难的中农，欢欣鼓舞，积极酝酿加入老社和组织新社。从许多生动事例，可以看出该县农村现已处于农业合作化运动高潮前夕。部分合作化基础较强而这次传达讨论又比较深入的村乡，已经开始进入运动高潮。要求加入农业生产合作社最为迫切的贫农，在这次听到传达以后，都说：“毛主席的眼睛真亮，他老人家在北京摸透了我们的心，我们的愿望现在能实现了。”
    孝感县已经建立了三百九十个农业生产合作社、一万一千多个互助组，组织起来的农民已占全县总农户百分之五十六。目前农村里许多农业生产互助组都在积极进行转社准备工作。据不完全统计，该县在最近新组成的互助组联合组（简称互助联组）已有四百八十七个。有许多互助联组并在酝酿土地入股。友谊乡徐玉贵互助组的农民听说这次建社要采用阶级分析方法，他们便自动请人代写每个人的历史，送给中共乡支部审查。许多互助组并着手改善劳动组织，实行“小包工”制，积极进行秋耕秋播和积肥工作，为争取建社后丰收创造条件。最近，这个县派出工作人员调查了一百一十七个老社周围情况，就有一千三百多户贫农要求加入老社。这些贫农过去大都是受着排挤的，这次听到中央的指示精神后，他们都欢欢喜喜地积极筹备入社股金，自动送到社里要求收纳。民主乡贫农张家勋把卖余粮的十五元都作为股金送到社里，要求批准他作为合作社的社员。在合作化高潮日益临近的新形势下，许多在过去对合作化运动采取冷淡观望态度的中农，经贫农的带动也开始积极地要求入社了。根据调查材料分析，目前孝感县农村中真正积极要求入社的农民，在工作基础较好的先进乡里要占总农户的百分之四十到五十，一般乡要占百分之三十左右，工作基础较差的落后乡也有占总农户百分之二十以上的农户要求入社。
    省委负责同志在谈话中着重指出：孝感农村的这种新形势，目前在湖北全省是有一定代表性的。但应该指出：根据这次了解的情况看，目前我们的农村工作人员虽然在学习中共中央关于农业合作化问题的指示后，思想水平有所提高，右倾情绪得到了一定程度的克服，并且对迎接农业合作化运动高潮已经作了不少准备工作。但与广大农民群众目前走合作化道路的高涨热情相比，仍然是领导落后于群众。其中突出的问题是：他们中间现在仍有不少人还没有正确地立即运用阶级分析方法，掌握农村情况，很好地进行建社规划，挑选好建社对象。这样的结果，将会使运动产生盲目性，产生自流与混乱现象。从而给富农分子和反革命分子留下了破坏运动的空隙。在孝感个别乡里已经出现富农分子操纵中农出面企图组织假社的事实。
    他又指出：中共湖北省委员会最近根据运动形势的发展，已经向全省农村各级党的组织发出了指示，要求各地继续批判右倾思想，领导干部必须结合“三定”工作亲自深入到乡，运用阶级分析方法，掌握好情况，把建社规划工作当作领导当前农业合作化运动的关键环节，严防运动的自流与混乱现象的产生。这个指示还强调对建社对象须认真审查挑选，及时组织建社骨干的训练，十分注意珍惜农民走社会主义道路的热情，同时必须提高警惕，严防敌人破坏，把合作化运动健康地领导前进。
