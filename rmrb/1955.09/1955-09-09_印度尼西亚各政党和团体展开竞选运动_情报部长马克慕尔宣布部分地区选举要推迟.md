Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th: Indonesia's first general election will begin on September 29th, and the election campaign is currently underway throughout the country. From the capital to small villages on remote islands, election signs of various political parties and groups can be seen everywhere. Mass rallies are being held in various towns, where leaders of various political parties are delivering speeches.

On September 4th, the Communist Party of Indonesia held a mass rally in Jakarta. The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indonesia, Aidit, and non-party candidate, Tole, delivered speeches at the rally. Aidit called on the people to make the voting day a day of unity against colonialism, so that the new parliament could be composed of people who oppose colonial rule, and that the parliament would become a weapon against the colonizers and their lackeys.

Tole said that before he was nominated as a candidate, he studied the program of the Communist Party of Indonesia and closely watched the struggle of the members of the Communist Party of Indonesia for the recovery of West Irian. He said that he had come to the conclusion that the Communist Party of Indonesia resolutely and selflessly fights for the Indonesian people, for West Irian and its people.

Former Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo is currently traveling in East Java and gave speeches at rallies on general elections hosted by the Indonesian Nationalist Party. Another leader of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Wilopo, is currently campaigning in various cities in West Java.

The Central Sumatra branch of the Indonesian Islamic League Party held a mass rally in Bukittinggi on September 3rd. The chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the party, Arudji Kartawinata, emphasized at the rally the need to unite in order to complete the national revolution and hold general elections. He said that the Dutch extract no less than 2.5 billion guilders from Indonesia every year. He demanded the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreements.

Natsir of the Masyumi Party and Sjahrir of the Indonesian Socialist Party are also currently delivering campaign speeches in many cities in Java.

At the same time, the calls for holding the vote as scheduled and preventing any attempts to postpone or sabotage the general election are rising as local election committees report the completion of election preparations. According to newspaper reports, areas that are ready to vote include East Java, Central Java, southern Sulawesi, southeastern Sulawesi, North Sumatra, and South Kalimantan.

The "Indonesian Torch" reported on the 5th that the commander of the Fifth Military District and the commander of the Seventh Military District have guaranteed the security of their defense zones during the elections. The newspaper said that some parties want to delay the elections under the pretext of poor security or insufficient preparation.

The Communist Party of Indonesia, the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Islamic League Party, the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, the National People's Party, the Greater Indonesia Party, and other parties all demanded that the general election not be postponed at a committee meeting held at the end of August. The Indonesian General Confederation of Trade Unions and the Indonesian People's Youth League have also recently made the same request.

Indonesian Nationalist Party leader Mangunsarkoro recently called in a speech for vigilance against attempts by foreign capital to bribe certain parties and politicians in order to influence the outcome of the general election.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th: Indonesian Minister of Information Makmur reiterated at a press conference on the 8th that the general election, which is in principle to be held on schedule, will be postponed in some areas.

Makmur said: The Indonesian Cabinet unanimously decided at a meeting on the 7th to hold the general election on schedule on September 29th. He went on to say that half of the 208 constituencies nationwide have declared that they are ready to hold the general election on September 29th. In addition, 24 constituencies have stated that they cannot be held on schedule, and other constituencies have not yet made a decision due to lack of general election equipment.

Makmur also said that emergency regulations have been invoked to amend some articles of the election law, including increasing the number of members of the election committee and the procedure for postponing the general election in the relevant areas.

The original election law stipulated that the Central Election Committee should have a maximum of nine members, and the Local Election Committee should have a maximum of seven members. The amended election law stipulates that the Central Election Committee should have at least nine members, and the Local Election Committee should have at least seven members. Those constituencies that do not hold elections on September 29th as scheduled will have the election date determined by the election committee of each constituency, but no later than November 29th.

    印度尼西亚各政党和团体展开竞选运动
    情报部长马克慕尔宣布部分地区选举要推迟
    新华社雅加达八日电印度尼西亚第一次普选将在九月二十九日开始举行，竞选运动目前正在全国各地展开。从首都到遥远的岛屿上的小村庄，到处都可以看到各政党和团体的竞选标志。各城镇纷纷举行群众大会，各政党的领袖在会上发表演说。
    九月四日，印度尼西亚共产党在雅加达举行群众集会。印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地和非党候选人托雷在会上发表了演说。艾地号召人民把投票日作为反对殖民主义的团结日，以使新的国会能由反对殖民统治的人来组成，并且使国会成为反对殖民者和它们的走狗的武器。
    托雷说，在他被提名为候选人以前，他研究了印度尼西亚共产党的纲领，并且密切地注视着印度尼西亚共产党党员为收回西伊里安而作的斗争。他说，他已经得出结论：印度尼西亚共产党坚决并且无私地为印度尼西亚全国人民、为西伊里安和它的人民而进行斗争。
    前总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约最近正在东爪哇旅行，并且在印度尼西亚国民党主持的关于普选的集会上发表了演说。印度尼西亚国民党的另一个领袖韦洛坡目前正在西爪哇各城市进行竞选活动。
    印度尼西亚回教联盟党中苏门答腊支部九月三日在武吉丁宜召开群众大会。这个党的中央执行委员会主席阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔在会上发表演说时强调团结起来以便完成民族革命和举行普选。他说，荷兰人每年从印度尼西亚榨取了不下于二十五亿盾。他要求废除圆桌会议协定。
    马斯友美党的纳席尔和印度尼西亚社会党的沙利尔目前也正在爪哇的许多城市发表竞选演说。
    同时，要求如期进行投票并且预防任何推迟或破坏普选的企图的呼声，随着各地方选举委员会报告选举筹备工作完成而越来越高涨。据报纸消息，已经准备好投票的地区包括东爪哇、中爪哇、苏拉威西的南部、苏拉威西的东南部、北苏门答腊和南加里曼丹。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”五日报道，第五军区司令官和第七军区司令官已经保证他们防区内进行选举期间的治安。这家报纸说，某些方面人士想在治安不良或者准备不充分和其他的借口之下来拖延选举。
    印度尼西亚共产党、印度尼西亚国民党、印度尼西亚回教联盟党、印度尼西亚回教教师联合会、国家人民党、大印度尼西亚党等党派在八月底举行的委员会会议上都提出了不得推迟普选的要求。印度尼西亚总工会和印度尼西亚人民青年团在最近也提出了同样的要求。
    印度尼西亚国民党领袖曼贡萨科罗在最近的演说中要求警惕外国资本对某些党派和政客行贿以影响普选结果的企图。
    新华社雅加达八日电印度尼西亚情报部长马克慕尔八日在记者招待会上再次说明在原则上按期举行的普选将在部分地区推迟。
    马克慕尔说：印度尼西亚内阁在七日会议上一致决定按期在九月二十九日举行普选。他接着又说，全国二百零八个选区中已经有一半宣布准备好在九月二十九日那天举行普选，此外，有二十四个选区表示不能按期举行，其他选区由于缺乏普选设备还未作出决定。
    马克慕尔又说，已经援引了紧急条例修改了选举法的一些条文，包括增加选举委员会委员的人数和在有关各地区推迟普选的程序。
    原来的选举法规定，中央选举委员会委员至多为九人，地方选举委员会委员至多为七人。修改后的选举法规定，中央选举委员会委员至少为九人，地方选举委员会委员至少为七人。那些不按期在九月二十九日举行选举的选区，将由各个选区的选举委员会自行决定选举日期，但是，不得迟于十一月二十九日。
