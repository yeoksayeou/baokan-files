    We See Agricultural Cooperatives Being Run More and Better
    Zhang Jiaqi
    Not long ago, some comrades from our work group inspected dozens of newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Caizi Township, Jianyang County, Duwei Township, Nanchong City, and Rongxi Township, Nanchong County, Sichuan Province. These three townships saw significant development in agricultural cooperatives last year. Caizi Township in Jianyang County is an advanced township. All thirteen villages in the township, with 1,704 households, now have cooperatives. Except for one cooperative established in 1953 as a trial by the county committee, the remaining twelve cooperatives were established in the spring and winter of 1954. A total of 673 farm households have joined the cooperatives, accounting for 37.4% of the township's total households. The largest cooperative has 206 households, the smallest has 28 households, and the average is 49 households per cooperative. Duwei Township in Nanchong City has basically achieved cooperativization. All eleven villages in the township, with 2,419 households, established thirty agricultural production cooperatives in three batches from spring to winter of 1954. A total of 1,432 farm households have joined the cooperatives, accounting for 59.1% of the township's total households. The largest cooperative has 103 households, the smallest has 30 households, and the average is 47.7 households per cooperative. Rongxi Township in Nanchong County is a general township. All twelve villages in the township, with 1,680 households, established nine agricultural production cooperatives in the summer and winter of 1954. A total of 263 farm households have joined the cooperatives, accounting for 15.6% of the township's total households. The average is 29.2 households per cooperative.
    After joint inspection and research with the Party branches of these townships, and based on the current situation of 52 cooperatives, we have roughly classified and ranked them as follows: The first category includes 22 cooperatives (6 in Caizi Township, 14 in Duwei Township, and 2 in Rongxi Township) with good production, significant increases in production, well-implemented contracting systems, high production enthusiasm among members, stable ideology, key members who have formed a leadership core and can operate independently, and who have set a good example for those outside the cooperatives. The second category includes 25 cooperatives (6 in Caizi Township, 14 in Duwei Township, and 5 in Rongxi Township) with average production and normal production order. The members' ideology is basically stable, and the key members are generally in good condition, but they have certain difficulties working independently. The third category includes only 5 cooperatives (1 in Caizi Township, 2 in Duwei Township, and 2 in Rongxi Township) with little increase in production or merely maintaining last year's production levels, and some even experiencing reduced production. Production order is chaotic, the organization is impure, members' ideology is unstable, a few people are demanding to withdraw from the cooperatives, and some leading key members have serious shortcomings.
    From the above situation, it can be seen that although many cooperatives were established in two or three batches within the past year, facts have proven that they have all been well-managed. Although there are still a very few backward cooperatives, as long as we earnestly strengthen leadership, these cooperatives can still change their backward situation and strive to gradually improve.
    The fact that agricultural cooperatives are well-managed is specifically manifested in the following three aspects: First, production is good, and production increases are high. As a result of distribution, the actual income of the vast majority of cooperative members has increased compared to before joining the cooperative. The spring harvest of the 52 cooperatives, except for one cooperative that reduced production by 5% due to disasters, all increased production to varying degrees. For example, the average yield of wheat per mu in the thirteen cooperatives of Caizi Township was 194 jin, more than 30 jin per mu compared to outside the cooperatives, and 14.8% higher than the township average of 169 jin per mu. The Victory Cooperative in this township produced 225 jin of wheat per mu, an increase of 42% compared to last year, barley increased by more than 50%, and rapeseed increased by more than 60%. Statistics from the 30 cooperatives in Duwei Township show that three cooperatives increased wheat production by 120% to 160% compared to last year, eight cooperatives increased production by 50% to 70%, and the rest increased production by 10% to 50%, with only one cooperative reducing production by 5%. The Tianba'er Cooperative had the most outstanding increase, with an average yield of 316 jin per mu on 105 mu of wheat. Rongxi Township was relatively worse, but seven of the nine cooperatives still increased production, and two maintained last year's production levels. Currently, the summer crops are being harvested, with large ears and full grains, and a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion. The reason why each cooperative can achieve such a significant increase in production is mainly due to the unified management of land and the unified use of labor, planting according to local conditions, exploiting the potential of the land, reasonable intercropping, increasing the cultivated area, and promoting several advanced technologies.
    Second, these cooperatives, after vigorous rectification this spring, further implemented the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, consolidated the unity of poor peasants and middle peasants within the cooperatives, and improved the production enthusiasm of the masses inside and outside the cooperatives. During the rectification, these townships earnestly handled specific policy issues such as draught cattle, farm tools, private plots, trees, investments, and sideline production, based on the principle of benefiting production, benefiting unity, and benefiting the development of the cooperatives. The production enthusiasm of the members has generally increased. For example, the 30 cooperatives in Duwei Township, due to the initial resolution of issues such as the pricing of pig feed and fertilizer, increased the number of pigs raised by 742 within two months and also drove the mutual aid teams to raise more pigs. After adjusting cattle prices, shortening payment periods, rushing to treat sick and thin cattle, and establishing feeding and usage systems, the township increased the number of draught cattle by seven, and 73 sick and thin cattle were fed and fattened. After the cooperatives promoted the development of household sideline occupations, the township has increased the number of chickens and ducks raised by more than 1,000, and rabbits by several hundred. The 30 cooperatives accumulated more than 1 million jin of fertilizer in more than a month. Many joint groups and farmers, seeing the superiority of the cooperatives in production, have requested to join old cooperatives or form new cooperatives. For example, farmers in three villages around the Victory Cooperative in Caizi Township are vying to join this cooperative. In Duwei Township, 72% of the 140 members of four joint groups are actively requesting to join the cooperative.
    Facts have proven that the work of rectifying the cooperatives is not as difficult as some people imagine. As long as the policies are explained to the masses and leadership is strengthened, many complex problems can be reasonably resolved. At the same time, consolidation work is also a long-term process. It should never be imagined that all problems can be solved and the cooperatives can be raised to an ideal "frame" through one movement.
    Third, in production management, these 52 cooperatives have generally implemented contracting systems and established some necessary and feasible production management responsibility systems. Duwei Township has also gained a set of experiences. They mobilized cooperative members to carefully formulate production plans and work point quotas for each agricultural task, and constantly checked, supplemented, and revised them during the production process. Based on production needs, labor was rationally organized and used, and various forms of work calculation methods could be adopted simultaneously within a cooperative. Some agricultural tasks suitable for individuals or households were directly contracted to households or individuals, avoiding frequent collective idling and waste. In the production process, a strict production management responsibility system with rewards and penalties was established, such as responsibility systems for field management, draught animal feeding and use, farm tools, fertilizers, and seeds, with dedicated personnel in charge. Work points were recorded using work cards, which greatly shortened the time for evaluating and calculating work points. Facts have proven that the worry that there would be too many cooperatives, that cadres would lack experience, and that they would not be able to lead is wrong. In these three townships, there was only one cooperative the year before last, and the vast majority were established last year. It should be said that they had no experience in running cooperatives, but they learned as they went, advanced in overcoming difficulties, and most of them managed the cooperatives well.
    The reason why these cooperatives are well-managed is mainly because the local leadership has implemented the policy of relying on the Party branches and the masses to run the cooperatives. These three townships have a total of 176 Party members. Except for a few who have not yet joined the cooperatives because they live too far away, the rest have joined the cooperatives, and most of them have become the leading key members of the cooperatives. The more than 300 Communist Youth League members under the leadership of the branch also played an active role. The eleven cooperatives established in Caizi Township before the autumn and winter of last year were basically established by the branch with the assistance of district staff. After the establishment of the cooperatives until now, in addition to regularly holding meetings of branch secretaries, township heads, agricultural cooperative accountants, and technicians to study and solve the problems of the cooperatives, there has been no dedicated person stationed in the township to work. The Party branch's leadership method for each cooperative is to divide into four support points. The branch secretary is stationed in a key cooperative, and the leadership of other cooperatives mainly relies on periodic meetings to exchange experiences and timely in-depth inspections. Special meetings are convened to mobilize and deploy during important production seasons such as rushing to plant and harvest, combating disasters, and promoting advanced technologies. The branch strengthens leadership by grasping both ends and bringing along the middle. Although there are no staff stationed in the cooperatives, more than a dozen cooperatives are still being run very well. On the contrary, in Duwei Township, there were too many staff, and some did not play a very good role, but instead restricted the enthusiasm and creativity of the cooperative staff.
    The above situation shows that the concern that cooperatives will not be well-managed if there are too many is unfounded, and the idea that cooperatives will not be well-managed without staff stationed in the cooperatives is, in fact, a lack of trust in the masses and a lack of trust in the leadership role of the Party branch. These ideas must be seriously criticized.
    But this does not mean that agricultural cooperatives have been run perfectly, and that there are no problems after the rectification. At present, these cooperatives still have some problems, and the problems in individual cooperatives are still very serious. For example, the organizational composition of a few cooperatives is impure, and counter-revolutionary elements and landlords and rich peasants have infiltrated the cooperatives to carry out sabotage. According to statistics from 950 cooperative members in 18 cooperatives in Duwei Township, there are a total of 48 landlords, rich peasants, former Kuomintang officers, reactionary party and league members, and reactionary secret society members (households), accounting for 5.05% of the total number of households in the 18 cooperatives. In the past, when establishing cooperatives, the political situation of the members was generally ignored, and there was a lack of due vigilance against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements after joining the cooperatives. These all deserve serious attention in the future. Secondly, political education work has not kept up accordingly, and the cooperative members' concept of loving the country and loving the cooperatives is weak. According to an analysis of 950 cooperative members in 18 cooperatives in Duwei Township, there are a total of 122 cooperative members with abnormal labor attitudes, rough work, who do not care for the crops and public property in the cooperatives, and whose thinking is not very stable, accounting for 12.8% of the 950 cooperative members. A small number of cooperatives have serious problems with theft, waste, and loss. In addition, the production management of some cooperatives is still relatively chaotic, the production management responsibility has not been established or is reduced to a formality, and the issue of personal remuneration has not been well resolved, so cooperative members are late for work, leave early, do rough work, and there is serious idling and absenteeism. Some cooperatives, in allocating labor, only start from taking care of the income of cooperative members, which restricts the enthusiasm of cooperative members with more labor and stronger labor. These problems are new problems that have emerged in the process of continuous progress. As long as we pay attention to them in time, study them in depth, and rely on the Party branch and the masses, they can be gradually resolved.

    我们看到农业合作社办得又多又好
    张家骐
    不久以前，我们工作组的几个同志在四川简阳县菜子乡、南充市都尉乡、南充县荣溪乡对一九五四年新建的几十个农业生产合作社进行了检查，这三个乡去年农业合作社都有很大发展。简阳县菜子乡是个先进乡，全乡十三个村，一千七百零四户，现已村村有社，除一个社是一九五三年县委试办的老社外，其余十二个社都是一九五四年春夏和冬季建立起来的。入社农户共六百七十三户，占全乡总农户百分之三十七点四。最大的社二百零六户，最小的二十八户，平均每社四十九户。南充市都尉乡已基本合作化，全乡十一个村，二千四百十九户，一九五四年从春季到冬季分三批建立了三十个农业生产合作社，入社农户共一千四百三十二户，占全乡总农户百分之五十九点一。最大的社一百零三户，最小的三十户，每社平均四十七点七户。南充县荣溪乡是个一般乡。全乡十二个村，一千六百八十户，一九五四年夏季和冬季建立了九个农业生产合作社，入社农户共二百六十三户，占全乡总农户的百分之十五点六。每社平均二十九点二户。
    经过同这些乡的党支部共同检查研究，根据五十二个社的现状大体分类排队如下：第一类生产好，增产显著，包工制执行得好，社员生产情绪高，思想稳定，骨干已形成领导核心并能独立作战，对社外起了良好的示范作用。这类社共二十二个，菜子乡六个，都尉乡十四个，荣溪乡两个。第二类生产一般，生产秩序还正常，社员思想基本稳定，骨干条件一般还好，但独立工作有一定困难。这类社共二十五个，菜子乡六个，都尉乡十四个，荣溪乡五个。第三类增产少或仅保持去年产量水平，个别的还减了产，生产秩序混乱，组织不纯，社员思想动荡，少数人闹退社，有的领导骨干有严重缺点，这类社只有五个，菜子乡一个，都尉乡两个，荣溪乡两个。
    从以上情况可以看出，虽然去年一年内分两三批办起了很多社，现在事实证明都办好了。虽然还有极少数的落后社，但只要认真加强领导，这些社还是可以改变落后面貌，争取逐步好转的。
    说农业合作社办好了，具体表现在以下三个方面：一、生产好、增产多，分配结果，绝大多数社员实际收入比入社前增加。五十二个社的小春作物，除一个社因灾害减产百分之五以外，都不同程度地增了产。如菜子乡十三个社的小麦，每亩平均产量一百九十四斤，比社外每亩多产三十多斤，比全乡平均产量一百六十九斤高出百分之十四点八。这个乡胜利社每亩小麦产二百二十五斤，比去年增产四成二，大麦增产五成多，油菜增产六成多。都尉乡三十个社统计：小麦比去年增产在百分之一百二十到一百六十的三个社，增产百分之五十到七十的八个社，其余都增产百分之十到五十，只一个社减产百分之五。夭把二社增产最突出，一百零五亩小麦，每亩平均产三百一十六斤。荣溪乡比较差些，但九个社仍有七个增了产，两个保持了去年产量水平。目前大春作物正在收割，穗大粒满，丰收已成定局。各社能这样突出增产，主要是土地统一经营，劳力统一使用后，因地种植，发挥土地潜力，合理复种、间种，增加耕地面积并推行了若干先进技术的结果。
    二、这些社经过今年春季的大力整顿，进一步贯彻了自愿互利政策，巩固了社内贫农同中农的团结，提高了社内外群众的生产积极性。整顿时这几个乡都对耕牛、农具、自留地、树木、投资、副业生产等具体政策方面的问题，本有利生产，有利团结和社的发展的原则，作了认真的处理，社员生产情绪普遍高涨。如都尉乡的三十个社，由于初步解决了猪的饲料、肥料作价等问题，两个月内喂的猪就增加了七百四十二只，并带动互助组也增喂了不少猪。经过调整牛价、缩短付款期、抢治病瘦牛、建立饲养使用制度后，全乡增加耕牛七头，七十三头病瘦牛都喂得肥壮了。各社提倡发展家庭副业后全乡已增喂鸡、鸭一千多只，兔子数百只。三十个社一个多月积肥一百多万斤。不少联组和农民见到社在生产上的优越性，纷纷要求加入老社或另组新社。如菜子乡胜利社周围三个村农民争着入这个社。都尉乡四个联组一百四十户组员，积极要求入社的占百分之七十二。
    事实证明，社的整顿工作并不是像某些人所想像的那样困难，只要把政策交代给群众，加强领导，许多复杂的问题都会得到合理解决的。同时巩固工作也是长期的，绝不能设想经过一个运动，就能把所有问题都解决，把社提高到理想的“框子里”。
    三、在生产管理上，这五十二个社普遍推行了包工制和建立了一些必要可行的生产管理责任制；都尉乡还取得了一套经验。他们发动社员认真制定生产计划和每项农活的工分定额，并在生产过程中不断检查、补充修正；根据生产需要，合理组织使用劳动力，一个社内可以同时采用多种形式的计工办法；有些适合个人或户的农活直接包给户或个人，避免了常常集体地窝工浪费。在生产过程中，还建立了严格的有报酬、有奖励的生产管理责任制，如田间管理、耕畜饲养和使用、农具、肥料、种子等专人保管等责任制，并采用工牌记分，大大缩短评工计分时间。事实证明：耽心社多了，干部没经验、领导不了的想法是错误的。这三个乡，前年只有一个社，绝大部分是去年建立的，应该说他们是没有办社经验的，但是他们边做边学，在克服困难中前进，还是绝大部分把社办好了。
    这些社所以办得好，主要是当地领导上贯彻了依靠党支部和群众办社的方针。这三个乡共有党员一百七十六个，除少数因住得太远暂时还没入社外，其余都参加了社，大部分并作了社的领导骨干，五十二个社就有四十九个社的社长是共产党员。在支部领导下的三百多个青年团员，也起了积极作用。菜子乡去年秋前和冬季建立的十一个社，基本上是以支部为主在区的工作人员协助下建立起来的。建社以后直到现在，区上除定期召开支部书记、乡长、农业合作社会计、技术员等会议研究解决社的问题外，没有专人固定驻乡工作。党支部对各社领导办法是分四个支点，支部书记驻一个重点社，对其它社的领导主要依靠定期会议交流经验和及时深入检查。在一些重要生产季节如抢种抢收、抗灾害、推行先进技术等，都专门召开会议进行动员布置。支部以抓两头、带中间的办法加强领导，虽没有驻社工作人员，十多个社仍然办得很好。相反的像都尉乡工作人员过多，有的未起到很好的作用，反而限制了社的工作人员的积极性和创造性。
    上述情况可以看出，认为社办多了就办不好的顾虑是没根据的，认为没有工作人员驻社社就办不好的思想，事实上是一种不相信群众，不相信党支部的领导作用的思想。这些思想必须认真批判。
    但这并不是说农业合作社已办得十全十美了，经过整顿后已没有问题了，目前这些社还有一些问题，个别社问题还很严重。如少数社组织成份不纯，被反革命分子和地主富农混入社进行破坏。据都尉乡十八个社九百五十户社员统计，地主、富农、伪军官、反动党团分子、反动会道门分子共有四十八人（户），占十八个社总户数百分之五点零五。过去建社时，一般的忽视了对社员政治情况的审查，入社后对反革命分子的破坏活动缺乏应有的警惕。这些都值得今后严重注意。其次是政治教育工作没有相应地跟上去，社员爱国爱社观念薄弱。据都尉乡十八个社九百五十户社员分析，其中劳动态度不正常、活路粗糙，不爱护社内庄稼和公物，思想不很稳定的社员共一百二十二个，占九百五十个社员的百分之十二点八。少数社偷窃浪费损失现象严重。此外，部分社生产管理仍较混乱，生产管理责任未建立或流于形式，个人计酬问题未很好解决，因而社员出工迟、收工早，活路粗糙，窝工旷工严重。有些社调配劳力上单从照顾社员收入出发，限制了劳力多劳力强的社员的积极性。这些问题，是在不断前进中出现的新问题，只要及时注意，深入研究，依靠党支部和群众，是可以逐步解决的。
