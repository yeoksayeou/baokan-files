    Beijing (By Our Own Correspondent) The youth labor models, shock team leaders, and inspection team leaders from Beijing's industrial, construction, and agricultural sectors held symposiums from the 3rd to the 8th of this month. At the meetings, they proposed that all young workers and farmers in the city take practical actions to increase production and practice economy to welcome the upcoming National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism.
    At the symposium held by youth industrial labor models Li Youzhi, Pan Yansheng, and 14 others, the labor models pointed out in their speeches that many young workers in the city still have shortcomings, such as not strictly following operating procedures and labor discipline, and not humbly learning technology and advanced experience. As a result, many people cannot fully complete the state plan, the quality of products is low, there are many defective products, and the phenomenon of wasting raw materials is serious. In the initiative unanimously adopted, they hoped that all young workers in the city would strive to improve product quality, overcome all difficulties, reduce the scrap rate by 20% to 50% according to state regulations, and strive to eliminate defective products and eliminate personal and machine accidents; at the same time, save raw materials as much as possible, and use every inch of steel, every drop of oil, every tael of cotton, every kilowatt-hour of electricity, every catty of coal, and every inch of wood in the most needed places for the construction of the motherland.
    At the meeting of more than 150 youth shock team leaders in the city's construction industry, which was initiated by the four youth shock teams of Zhang Baifa, Yu Chunhe, Feng Bensen, and Hu Yaolin, the representatives of the four teams read a letter from them to the city's construction youth shock teams. The letter suggested: strictly economize on raw materials, reduce the loss rate of raw materials to below the administrative regulation indicators, and complete 20% more of the September production tasks under the premise of ensuring project quality, as a gift to the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism. The Zhang Baifa shock team also proposed: in the recent task of binding 32 tons of steel bars, they will exceed the quota by more than 40%, save 544 kilograms of steel bars, and advance the construction period by two days. The meeting unanimously decided to call on the city's construction youth shock teams and other young workers to work hard to realize their gift plans.
    At the meeting of youth labor models, shock team leaders, and inspection team leaders in the suburban rural areas, it was also proposed that young people and teenagers in rural areas should reduce the loss of grain and cotton during the autumn harvest, earnestly do a good job in careful harvesting, careful threshing, good drying, and good storage, ensure a bumper harvest, and return every grain to the home, and immediately launch a grain picking movement during the autumn harvest, with each rural youth picking up five catties of grain. In this way, all suburban rural youths can pick up 500,000 catties of grain as a gift to the conference.
    The initiatives of youth labor models, shock team leaders, etc., have been supported by the majority of young workers and young farmers. Wherever these initiatives are passed on, it becomes active there. Many young workers in factories and enterprises held meetings to check the shortcomings in their work and put forward guarantees for improving product quality and saving raw materials. All young workers in the No. 8 workshop of the Weaving Workshop of the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory guaranteed to reduce the substandard rate by another 5% in September according to administrative regulations; all young workers in the No. 2 workshop of the Fine Yarn Workshop guaranteed that no bad yarn would be produced in September. The Youth Saving Team of the Freight Car Workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has challenged the factory's thirteen youth saving teams. They guarantee to utilize a total of 15 tons of old steel and iron, 3,000 various old screws, and 300 rivets by the end of the year, saving the country more than 10,000 yuan. Soon, seven youth saving teams put forward guarantee conditions to respond to their challenge. More than 30 young members of the Second Work Section of the Second Engineering Zone of the Beijing No. 4 Construction Engineering Company have made personal guarantee conditions. Many adult and elderly workers in the city also said that they would help young workers complete the plan.

    北京市青年劳动模范等提出增产节约倡议
    本报讯　北京市工业、建筑业、农业的青年劳动模范、突击队队长、检查队队长分别在三日到八日召开了座谈会，会上倡议全市青年职工、农民以增加生产、厉行节约的实际行动来迎接即将召开的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    在青年工业劳动模范李友芝、潘燕生等十四人举行的座谈会上，劳动模范们在发言中指出：目前全市青年职工中，还有不严格遵守操作规程和劳动纪律、不虚心学习技术和先进经验等缺点。因此，有不少人不能全面地完成国家计划，产品质量低、废品多和浪费原材料的现象严重。他们在一致通过的倡议书中，希望全市青年职工努力提高产品质量，克服一切困难，按国家规定的废品率降低百分之二十到五十，争取消灭废品，消灭人身和机器事故；同时，尽量节约原材料，把每一寸钢铁、每一滴石油、每一两棉花、每一度电、每一斤煤和每一寸木材，都用到建设祖国的最需要的地方去。
    在由张百发、于春和、冯本森和胡耀林四个青年突击队倡议召开的全市建筑业一百五十多个青年突击队队长会议上，四个队的代表宣读了他们给全市建筑业青年突击队的一封信。信中建议：严格节约原材料，把原材料的损耗率降低到行政规定指标以下，在保证工程质量的前提下，超额百分之二十以上完成九月份的生产任务，作为向全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的献礼。张百发突击队还提出：在最近一次绑扎三十二吨铁筋的任务中，要超过定额百分之四十以上，节约铁筋五百四十四公斤，提前工期两天。会议一致决定号召全市建筑业青年突击队和其他青年工人努力实现自己的献礼计划。
    各郊区农村青年劳动模范、突击队队长、检查队队长的会上也提出倡议，要求农村的青年、少年在秋收中减少粮食和棉花的损耗，认真做到细收、细打、晒好、藏好，保证丰产丰收，颗粒还家，并立即展开秋收中的拣粮运动，每个农村青年要拣回五斤粮。这样，全郊区农村青年就可拣回五十万斤粮食，作为向大会的献礼。
    青年劳动模范、突击队队长等的倡议，受到了广大青年职工和青年农民的拥护。这些倡议传到那里，那里就活跃起来。许多工厂企业的青年职工举行集会，检查自己工作中的缺点，提出提高产品质量、节约原材料的保证。国营北京第二棉纺织厂织布车间八工区全体青年工人，保证九月份按行政规定的次品率再降低百分之五；细纱车间二工区全体青年工人保证九月份不出一个坏纱。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂货车车间青年节约队，已经向全厂十三个青年节约队提出挑战，他们保证到年底共利用旧钢铁十五吨，各种旧螺丝三千条，铆钉三百个，为国家节约一万多元。很快就有七个青年节约队提出保证条件，向他们应战。北京市第四建筑工程公司二工区二工段，有三十多个青年团员订出了个人保证条件。全市许多成年和老年职工，也表示要帮助青年职工完成计划。
