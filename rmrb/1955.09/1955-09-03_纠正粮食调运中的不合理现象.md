Correcting Unreasonable Phenomena in Grain Transfer

To the Editor:

Currently, unreasonable transportation phenomena continue to appear in grain transfer work, causing huge losses to the state. The occurrence of these phenomena is due to the following different situations:

Due to the grain transfer departments' lack of thorough understanding of the grain inventory and sales situation in various regions, and the lack of comprehensive planning, serious waste of transportation capacity and freight has been caused. For example, in the first half of this year, corn from Inner Mongolia was transported to Hankou, while corn from Sichuan was transported through Hankou to Shandong, and corn from Shaanxi was transported to Beijing. As a result, more than 7,000 tons of grain were transported in opposing directions, wasting 10.5 million ton-kilometers of transportation capacity, equivalent to 142 thirty-ton railway cars traveling back and forth empty on the Longhai Railway, with freight expenditure of about 90,000 yuan. Another example is last year when Hunan Province transferred a large amount of grain from Daoxian and Ningyuan counties to Lingling County. Later, it was found that the inventory of these two counties, from which grain was transferred, was too small, and there was a danger of grain shortages. Then a large amount of grain was transferred back to the original locations from Lingling County. This round trip transfer wasted more than 160,000 yuan in freight. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Hebei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi provinces and Hengyang in Hunan, and Qimen and Jixi in Anhui last year, the total amount of freight wasted due to roundabout transportation and re-transfer of grain exceeded 5 million yuan.

Due to the mismatch between the geographical distribution of processing plants and the grain production and sales situation, a large amount of two-way flow of raw grain and finished grain has been caused. For example, the wheat required by Shanghai's flour mills has to be transported from Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Zhejiang and other provinces, and the processed flour has to be transported back to Zhejiang Province, or transported through Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong and other provinces to North China and Northeast China. In the four years from July 1949 to June 1953, the state suffered losses of 8.75 million yuan in freight and prices as a result; in 1954, freight losses alone amounted to 490,000 yuan.

Due to the excessive emphasis on eating habits or grain quality in certain areas, unreasonable transportation incidents have also been caused. For example, Shanghai is accustomed to eating a part of japonica rice. In the first half of this year, more than 100,000 tons of japonica rice and japonica rice paddy were transferred from Changzhou and Wuxi areas of Jiangsu Province; while Jiangxi, Guangxi and other provinces transferred more than 90,000 tons of indica rice and indica rice paddy to Wuxi, Changzhou, Nanjing and other places via Shanghai. If the indica rice and indica rice paddy from Jiangxi and Guangxi were transferred to Shanghai, and the japonica rice and japonica rice paddy from Wuxi and Changzhou were supplied to the local area and Nanjing, a lot of freight could be saved. Another example is that the wheat in western Inner Mongolia should be transported to Beijing according to the rational flow, but because of its poor quality, Beijing is unwilling to accept it, so it has to be transferred to Hebei; and Beijing separately transfers wheat from Shaanxi and Gansu. According to statistics for May and June this year, the transportation capacity wasted as a result totaled 13.4 million ton-kilometers, and the freight loss amounted to more than 439,000 yuan.

This phenomenon of unreasonable transportation should not be allowed to continue. Grain transfer departments must strictly implement the work of grain zoning, production and sales balance, and rational transportation, strengthen the planning of transfer work, properly solve the unreasonable geographical distribution of processing plants, and strictly control the variety adjustment work.

### 纠正粮食调运中的不合理现象

    纠正粮食调运中的不合理现象编辑同志：
    目前在调运粮食工作中，还不断出现不合理运输的现象，使国家遭受了巨大的损失。这些现象的发生有下面种种不同的情况：
    由于粮食调运部门对各地粮食库存情况和购销情况摸底不透，没有全面安排，造成了运输力和运费的严重浪费。例如，今年上半年内蒙古的玉米运往汉口，而四川的玉米却经过汉口运往山东，陕西的玉米又运往北京，结果有七千多吨粮食对流运输，浪费的运输力达一千零五十万吨公里，等于一百四十二个三十吨的车皮在陇海铁路上来回空驶一次，运费支出约九万多元。又如去年湖南省曾把道县和宁远县粮食大量调往零陵县，后来发现调出粮食的这两个县库存量太少，粮食有脱销的危险，就又从零陵县把大批粮食调回原地。这样往返调运，共浪费运费十六万多元。据去年山东、河北、浙江、江西四省和湖南的衡阳、安徽的祁门和绩溪三个地方不完全的统计，由于粮食迂回运输和倒运而浪费的运费总数在五百万元以上。
    由于加工厂的地区分布情况同粮食产销情况不相适应，造成了原粮和成品粮大量对流的现象。如上海市的面粉厂所需小麦要从江苏、安徽、山东、浙江等省运来，加工以后的面粉又要运回浙江省，或经过江苏、安徽、山东等省运往华北、东北等地。从一九四九年七月到一九五三年六月的四年中，国家因此在运费和价格上的损失达八百七十五万元；在一九五四年，仅运费一项损失就达四十九万元。
    由于某些地区过分地强调吃粮习惯或粮食质量，也造成了不合理运输的事件。如上海市习惯吃一部分粳米，今年上半年从江苏省的常州、无锡一带调运了粳米、粳稻十几万吨；而江西、广西等省又经过上海市调运给无锡、常州、南京等地籼米、籼稻九万多吨。如果将江西、广西的籼米、籼稻调给上海，而把无锡、常州一带的粳米、粳稻供应当地和南京市的需要，这样就可以节省很多运费。又如内蒙古西部的小麦按合理流向应该运给北京市，但是因为品质较差，北京市不愿接收，只得把这批小麦调往河北；而北京市另外从陕西、甘肃再调进小麦。据今年五、六两个月的统计，因此而浪费的运输力共一千三百四十万吨公里，运费损失达四十三万九千多元。
    不应该让这种不合理运输的现象再继续存在了。粮食调运部门必须严格地推行粮食分区、产销平衡、合理运输的工作，加强调运工作的计划性，妥善解决加工厂地区分布不合理的现象，并且严格地掌握品种调剂工作。　吴学成
