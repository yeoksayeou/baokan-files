Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 14th: According to TASS, Moscow, "Pravda" published an editorial on the 14th on the successful conclusion of the negotiations between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The editorial is entitled: "An Important Step Towards Further Easing International Tension."

The editorial said: All peace-loving people, especially the people of the Soviet Union and Germany, will be very satisfied with the successful conclusion of the negotiations between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The positive results of this negotiation constitute the basis for establishing friendly cooperation between the two countries in the future.

The editorial continued: The negotiations on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, held at the initiative of the Soviet government, were conducted in a spirit of mutual understanding—a spirit that once inspired the participants of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference and guaranteed the success of that meeting. The positive results of the Moscow negotiations once again emphatically demonstrate that when urgent international issues are discussed and resolved taking into account the interests of all parties concerned, the method of earnest cooperation that was successfully used in Geneva opens up broad possibilities for reaching agreements. At the same time, this negotiation once again convincingly demonstrates that the notorious policy of "negotiating from a position of strength" has completely gone bankrupt, and those who still insist on implementing this policy will only be defeated.

The editorial pointed out: The complete openness of the two negotiating parties in stating their views contributed to the success of the negotiations to a considerable extent. Although these views were inconsistent in many respects, this frank statement enabled both parties to better understand each other's attitudes, thereby finding a way to reach an agreement. This negotiation reaffirmed with new force the great creative significance of Soviet foreign policy, which takes into account both past experiences and pressing international issues. It mainly does not start from the past, but looks to the future; and in this specific case, the future requires the establishment of good and friendly relations between the Soviet and German people.

The editorial continued: Foreign newspapers have said a lot that the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany came to Moscow this time, a bit like a "prelude" to the meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries in Geneva in October. In the following sense, one can agree with the above statement: the successful conclusion of the Moscow negotiations is a good omen, which shows that the upcoming foreign ministers' meeting can be successful if all participants show sincerity in cooperation.

The editorial then quoted Khrushchev's words in the negotiations, pointing out that the goal of the Soviet government is to ensure world peace. The Soviet Union is willing to establish normal and friendly relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as with Britain, France, the United States, and other countries in the world. The editorial then said: The results of this negotiation disrupted the calculations of certain groups who had tried to prevent the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany, thereby seeking excuses for restoring the "Cold War" and undermining the serious international cooperation that began at the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference.

The editorial concluded: The results of the negotiations concluded in Moscow more powerfully show the world that the Soviet Union consistently and unswervingly strives to further ease international tension, to expand earnest cooperation with countries with different social systems, and to strengthen world peace and security. The Soviet people believe that the results of the negotiations are a new victory for the Soviet peaceful foreign policy, a new manifestation of the spirit of earnest cooperation in international relations, and an important victory for the forces of peace. These results are completely in line with the interests of the Soviet people and the German people.

    “真理报”就苏联和西德谈判结束发表社论
    新华社十四日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十四日就苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团的谈判圆满结束一事发表社论，社论题目是：“走向进一步缓和国际紧张局势的重要的一步”。
    社论说：一切爱好和平的人民，尤其是苏联和德国人民，对于苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团的谈判圆满结束将感到非常满意。这次谈判的积极结果构成在今后建立两国友好合作的基础。
    社论接着说：由于苏联政府的倡议而举行的关于建立苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的外交关系的谈判是本着互相谅解的精神进行的——这种精神曾经鼓舞了日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议的参加者，并且保证了那个会议的成功。莫斯科谈判的积极结果再一次着重表明：当人们在考虑到各有关方面的利益的情况下讨论和解决迫切的国际问题时，在日内瓦曾经成功地运用过的认真合作的办法就为达成协议开辟了广阔的可能。同时，这次谈判再一次令人信服地表明：声名狼藉的“从实力地位出发”的政策是彻底地破产了，那些仍然坚持要实施这种政策的人只会遭到失败。
    社论指出：谈判双方完全开诚布公地陈述它们的见解在相当大的程度上促使了谈判的成功。虽然这些见解在许多方面是不一致的，但是，这种坦白的陈述使双方能够更好地了解彼此的态度，从而找出达成协议的道路。这次谈判以新的力量再次肯定了苏联外交政策的伟大的创造性意义，这种外交政策既考虑到过去的经验，又照顾到迫切的国际问题。它主要不是从过去出发，而是从将来着眼；而在这个具体情况下，将来就要求建立苏联和德国人民之间的良好的、友善的关系。
    社论接着说：外国报纸曾经说过不少这样的话：德意志联邦共和国政府代表团这次到莫斯科来，有点像四国外长十月间在日内瓦举行的会议的“前奏”。在下面这个意义上，人们可以同意上述这种说法：莫斯科谈判的胜利结束是一个吉兆，它表明即将举行的外长会议是可以获得成功的，如果所有的参加者都表现出进行合作的诚意的话。
    社论接着引赫鲁晓夫在谈判中说过的话，指出苏联政府的目标是保障世界和平。苏联愿意同德意志联邦共和国建立正常的友好关系，也愿意同英、法、美等国以及世界上其他国家建立这种关系。社论然后说：这次谈判的结果打乱了某些集团的如意算盘，这些集团曾经设法阻止苏联和西德之间关系的正常化，从而为恢复“冷战”和破坏在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上开始的认真的国际合作寻找借口。
    社论最后说：在莫斯科结束的谈判的结果向全世界更加有力地表明：苏联言行一致地、坚持不渝地为进一步缓和国际紧张局势，为扩大同一切社会制度不同的国家的认真合作，为加强世界的和平和安全而努力。苏联人民认为：谈判的结果是苏联和平外交政策的新的胜利，是在国际关系中进行认真合作的精神的新的表现，是和平力量的重要的胜利。这些结果是完全符合苏联人民和德国人民的利益的。
