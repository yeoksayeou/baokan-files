    Is Japan Willing to Act as an Instrument of American Aggression?

    On September 9th, the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" revealed that a group of Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers were being trained at American military bases in Japan. Subsequently, Kyodo News also disclosed that military personnel from the Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques were also being trained in Japan. This illegal act has aroused great indignation among the Japanese public.

    In order to evade the accusations of the Japanese people, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has made various futile justifications. It said that the Japanese government had not received any notification from the U.S. military authorities regarding the training of Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers and would therefore conduct an investigation into the incident. However, the U.S. Far East Army Command issued a statement saying that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers at the U.S. base had entered Japan with valid visas obtained from the Japanese government. The Foreign Ministry said that these Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers were "guests" of the U.S. military authorities. But Williams, the press officer of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, has admitted that "the training is being conducted under the command of the U.S. Far East Command Headquarters." The Japanese Foreign Ministry's excuses cannot conceal the fact that the U.S. military authorities' training of Chiang Kai-shek military personnel in Japan was done with the prior consent of the Japanese government.

    The Japanese government's agreement to allow the United States to train military personnel from the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques on Japanese territory is a serious violation of the interests of the Japanese people and affects Japan's relations with Asian countries. People have not forgotten that Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama has repeatedly stated that Japan will follow the path of peaceful coexistence and strive to restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union. Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also put forward four principles of Japanese foreign policy at the beginning of this cabinet, one of which was to normalize relations between China and Japan as soon as possible "under the principle of good neighborliness." The United States is training Chiang Kai-shek military personnel on Japanese territory in an attempt to subvert the government of the People's Republic of China and continue to interfere in China's internal affairs. This is a very simple, common-sense issue; it is impossible to interpret it in any other way. The Japanese government has taken a cooperative attitude towards this action by the United States, and one cannot help but ask: how will Hatoyama and Shigemitsu explain their "peaceful coexistence" and "good neighborliness principle"? Since the Japanese government supports and participates in this aggressive activity against China, what position does it intend to place itself in with regard to its relations with the People's Republic of China?

    The Japanese public is concerned that Japanese authorities, without the knowledge of the Japanese people, are further turning Japan into a base for U.S. aggression in the Far East and the Western Pacific. The United States has shipped atomic rocket launchers to Japan, and the U.S. military in Japan continues to expand its air bases, especially with Japan succumbing to the United States' bearing military obligations in recent Japan-U.S. negotiations. This series of facts cannot but arouse the indignation of the Japanese people. The situation in Japan has sharply presented Japanese politicians with the following question: will they follow an independent policy, coexist peacefully with Asian countries, thereby enhancing Japan's position in Asia and the world and safeguarding Japan's political and economic interests? Or will they willingly accept American exploitation and become an instrument of American aggression in Asia and the Western Pacific? This question is not only related to the peace and security of Asia, but also primarily to the fundamental interests of Japan. Any sensible Japanese politician will not find it difficult to make the right decision on this.

### 日本甘愿充当美国的侵略工具吗

    日本甘愿充当美国的侵略工具吗
    九月九日，日本“朝日新闻”揭露：一批蒋贼军官，在日本的美国军事基地上受训。接着，日本共同社又透露，在日本受训的，还有李承晚和吴庭艳集团的军事人员。这一非法行为被揭发以后，日本公众表示了极大的愤慨。
    为了逃避日本人民的指责，日本外务省进行了各种各样徒劳无益的辩解。它说，日本政府没有得到过美军当局训练蒋贼军官的通知，因此，他们将对这一事件进行调查。但是，美国远东陆军司令部发表的声明却说：在美国基地的蒋贼军官，是获得日本政府的有效签证而进入日本的。外务省说，这些蒋贼军官是美军当局的“宾客”。但是美军第一骑兵师的新闻官威廉斯已承认，“训练是在美国远东军总司令部的指挥下进行的”。日本外务省的辩解无法掩饰这样一个事实，那就是：美军当局在日本训练蒋贼军事人员，是事先得到了日本政府的同意的。
    日本政府同意美国在日本领土上训练蒋贼集团和李承晚、吴庭艳集团的军事人员，严重地违背了日本人民的利益，并且影响到日本与亚洲国家的关系。人们没有忘记，日本首相鸠山曾经一再表示过日本将遵循和平共处的道路，努力同中苏恢复正常关系。日本外务相重光也在这届内阁成立之初，提出了日本外交政策的四项原则，其中之一就是要“在睦邻的原则之下”尽速使中日之间的关系趋于正常化。美国在日本领土上训练蒋贼军事人员，目的是企图颠覆中华人民共和国政府，继续干涉中国内政。这是一个十分简单的、属于常识性的问题；不可能作另外一种解释。对于美国的这一行径，日本政府竟然采取了合作的态度，人们不禁要问：鸠山和重光将怎样来解释自己的“和平共处”和“睦邻原则”？日本政府既然支持并参与这一针对中国的侵略活动，那末它在对中华人民共和国的关系上，究竟打算把自己摆在一个什么地位？
    日本的公众忧虑：日本当局在背着日本人民的情况下，正进一步地把日本变为美国在远东和西太平洋进行侵略活动的基地。美国原子火箭炮运到日本，驻日美军继续扩大空军基地，特别是最近日美谈判中日本屈从美国承担军事义务。这一系列的事实，不能不激起日本人民的愤慨。日本的局势，已向日本的政治家尖锐地提出了这样一个问题：他们将遵循独立政策、与亚洲国家和平共处、从而提高日本在亚洲和世界上的地位并保障日本的政治经济利益呢？还是甘愿接受美国的利用，成为美国在亚洲和西太平洋的侵略工具？这个问题不仅关系到亚洲的和平和安全，而且首先关系到日本的根本利益。凡是头脑清醒的日本政治家，对此是不难作出正确的决定的。
