Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th. In-depth investigation and research, and serious consideration for the masses are characteristics of Chongqing's recent preparations for grain rationing. Before formulating the draft implementation plan for citywide grain rationing, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee sent cadres to factories, construction sites, residential areas, schools, and government offices to carefully investigate the grain consumption of various types of work and people. They formulated a preliminary implementation plan and then distributed it to more than eighty representative units throughout the city for discussion. Party and government leaders in each unit analyzed and studied the grain consumption situation in their respective units and offered many supplementary and revised opinions on the draft.

Based on the opinions of the masses, the Municipal People's Committee made nine relatively important revisions. For example, considering that Chongqing is a mountain city with steep slopes and that manual water carriers expend a lot of physical strength, their grain ration level was appropriately increased. The Sichuan inland river channels are treacherous, and boatmen expend a great deal of physical strength during transportation. Therefore, long-distance wooden boat workers, trackers, and log rafters were all classified as special physical laborers.

Chongqing is a city close to rice-producing areas, and in the past, rice was the most supplied grain. To allow urban residents to diversify their grain sources and improve their diets, in addition to the original provisions for rice and flour as staple foods, the Municipal People's Committee also stipulated that seven types of grains, including corn, sweet potatoes, soybeans, glutinous rice, and mung beans, would also be included as staple foods, and reasonable conversion rates for rice and these coarse grains were set. Citizens can purchase these grains with grain coupons.

To facilitate grain purchases for the people, the Municipal People's Committee repeatedly studied and stipulated matters related to household registration transfers and floating populations, simplifying procedures as much as possible. Currently, each street office in the city has added one to three grain affairs officers to handle procedures such as increasing, decreasing, and transferring grain supplies for residents.

The Chongqing Municipal People's Committee recently held an expanded meeting to discuss the implementation plan for implementing the interim measures for grain rationing. Representatives from all walks of life who attended the meeting believed that the formulation of this plan was in line with the actual situation of the city and unanimously approved the plan.

(This newspaper's report) After cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai in Shandong Province, with populations of more than 50,000, implemented the method of graded and quantitative grain supply in towns and cities on September 1, residents are very satisfied, and a new atmosphere of grain saving has emerged. Generally, the negotiated quantitative distribution to households does not exceed the prescribed quantitative standards. According to statistics from more than 94,600 households in Qingdao that negotiated quantitative distribution, 97.4 percent of households did not exceed the standard. Li Da Niang, a martyr's family member in Weifang City with a family of five, originally received 145 jin of grain. After learning about the benefits of rationing this time, she voluntarily reduced it to 108 jin, an average reduction of 7.4 jin per person. In Linqing City, the average grain supply for all residents was reduced by three jin compared with the original supply, and residents throughout the city can save more than 900,000 jin of grain annually.

Through verifying the quantitative distribution, citizens have also generally learned to plan their lives and established a good atmosphere of thrift and frugality. Han Zhao Shi, a resident of Dayi Street in Linqing City, cooks meals every day according to her planned amount of grain, which is both delicious and filling, and saves grain. (Quan)

    重庆认真制定全市粮食定量供应实施方案
    济南等市实行定量供应后居民积极节约粮食
    新华社重庆十二日电　深入调查研究，认真为群众着想是重庆市在最近从事粮食定量供应准备工作中的一个特点。重庆市人民委员会在制定全市粮食定量供应实施草案前，曾派干部深入厂矿、工地、居民段、学校和机关中仔细调查了各种工种、各种人的粮食消费情况，订出了初步实施方案，然后分发到全市八十多个有代表性的单位进行讨论。各单位的党、政领导干部对所在单位粮食消费的情况，也都作了分析和研究，并对草案提出了不少补充和修改的意见。
    根据群众意见，市人民委员会先后作了九次较重要的修改。例如对职业挑水工人，考虑到重庆是一个山城，坡度较大，体力消耗较多，适当提高了他们的粮食定量等级。四川内河河道滩险水急，在运输中船工体力消耗很大，因此对长航木船工人、纤工、放木筏工人等都列为特种体力劳动。
    重庆是靠近稻谷产区的一个城市，过去供应以大米最多，为使城市居民能得到粮种上的调剂，改善伙食，除原规定大米、面粉两种口粮外，市人民委员会还规定玉米、红薯、黄豆、糯米、绿豆等七种也列为口粮，并合理规定了大米和这些杂粮的折合率。市民可凭粮票买到这些粮种。
    市人民委员会为便利人民群众购粮，有关户口迁移、流动人口等问题，都作了反复研究和规定，尽可能地简化手续。目前全市各街道办事处都增设粮食干事一名到三名，为居民办理粮食供应的增、减、转移等手续。
    重庆市人民委员会最近召开扩大会议，讨论了关于贯彻粮食定量供应暂行办法的实施方案，到会的各阶层人民代表，都认为这个方案的制定，切合本市实际情况，一致通过了这个方案。
    本报讯　山东省济南、青岛、烟台等十个五万人口以上城市，自九月一日开始实行市镇粮食分等定量供应办法后，居民都很满意，出现了节约粮食的新气象。根据协商定量到户的一般都不超过规定的定量标准。据青岛市协商定量的九万四千六百多户的统计，有百分之九十七点四的户不超过标准。潍坊市烈属李大娘五口人，原供应一百四十五斤，当她这次了解到定量供应的好处后，自动降为一百零八斤，每人平均降低用粮七点四斤。临清市全市居民平均供应量比原供应量降低三斤，全市居民全年即可节约粮食九十多万斤。
    通过核实定量，市民还普遍学会计划过日子，树立起俭省节约的优良风气。临清市大义街居民韩赵氏，每天按自己计划的粮食做饭，既吃的好，又吃的饱，又节约粮食。　（泉）
