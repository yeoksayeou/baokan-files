    Jiaxing Sauce Garden Uses River Snail Meat to Make Soy Sauce
    Yongxingtai Sauce Garden in Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, has successfully researched and used river snail meat to replace flour and soybeans in the trial production of high-grade soy sauce (i.e., soy sauce essence).
    When using river snail meat to replace flour and soybeans to make soy sauce, it only needs to be heated, added with ingredients, and filtered to become high-grade soy sauce. The color, aroma, and taste are the same as those made from flour and soybeans. It has been certified as qualified by the government health department. According to Jiaxing city statistics, after it is promoted throughout the city, the whole year can save 86,800 jin of flour or 108,500 jin of soybeans. The cost per 100 liters of high-grade soy sauce can be reduced by 5%.
    River snails are produced in large quantities in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, and the supply is abundant. Jiaxing City currently has river snail boats that can provide 40 to 80 dan of river snails every day, and they are available all year round. Using river snail meat to make high-grade soy sauce can not only save food for the country, but also increase the income of fishermen and improve their lives.

    嘉兴一酱园用螺蛳肉制酱油
    浙江省嘉兴市泳兴泰酱园研究用螺蛳肉代替面粉、黄豆试制高度酱油（即酱油精）获得成功。
    用螺蛳肉代替面粉、黄豆制酱油时，只要将它经过加热、加配料、过滤等过程，即成高度酱油，色、香、味均与面粉、黄豆所制的相同。经政府卫生部门鉴定合格。据嘉兴市统计，全市推广后，全年可节约面粉八万六千八百斤或黄豆十万八千五百斤。每百公升高度酱油的成本可降低百分之五。
    螺蛳在杭嘉湖地区出产很多，货源充足，嘉兴市现有螺蛳船每天能够提供螺蛳四十担至八十担，而且一年四季都有。利用螺蛳肉制高度酱油后，不但可以为国家节约粮食，而且可以增加渔民收入，改善渔民生活。
