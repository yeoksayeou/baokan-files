Strive to Fulfill the Rapeseed Sowing Plan
    Zhang Zhiyuan

    Due to the impact of last year's disaster, the rapeseed sowing period was delayed, and major producing areas suffered frost damage. In addition, disaster areas lacked draught animals and fertilizers, and cultivation was crude, resulting in the failure to complete the 1955 rapeseed production increase task. In order to compensate for the loss of oil production and ensure the people's need for edible oil, all localities must mobilize the broad masses of farmers during this year's rapeseed autumn sowing season to strive to complete and exceed this year's rapeseed sowing plan.

    Further expanding the use of winter fallow fields and advocating intercropping rapeseed in green manure fields and broad bean fields is an effective way to increase oil production without competing with grain and cotton for land. According to preliminary estimates, there are over 100 million mu of winter fallow fields nationwide. As long as water conservancy projects are combined and farmers are actively guided to change their farming habits, it is entirely possible to expand rapeseed cultivation on a portion of the better-conditioned winter fallow fields without hindering the cultivation of major spring crops. Hunan Province plans to expand the cultivated area by over 4 million mu using winter fallow fields during this year's rapeseed autumn sowing, an increase of over 1 million mu compared to last year's autumn sowing. Other provinces should also make full use of this favorable condition to appropriately expand the use of winter fallow fields on the basis of the original winter sowing area and increase oil production.

    Local experiences have proven that intercropping rapeseed in green manure fields and broad bean fields not only does not affect the yield of green manure and broad beans, but also increases rapeseed production and farmers' income. For example, farmers in Wenjiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, intercrop rapeseed in milk vetch (green manure) fields, and in addition to harvesting a normal yield of green manure, they can harvest more than 100 jin of rapeseed per mu. Some farmers in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and other provinces also have the habit of intercropping rapeseed in green manure fields and broad bean fields, and the results are very good. These areas should promptly summarize and exchange experiences, and actively guide farmers to widely use milk vetch, purple cloud alfalfa, broad beans, etc. to intercrop with rapeseed to increase oil production.

    This year's rapeseed sowing task is relatively large, and the newly developed areas and areas where green manure and broad beans are intercropped with rapeseed will increase compared to the past. Therefore, all localities must first do a good job in seed supply, and should especially select local early-maturing and high-yielding varieties for promotion. Some people believe that there are very few improved varieties, and it is difficult to expand the area of improved varieties. This is not in line with the facts. Rapeseed has a long history of cultivation in our country, and the masses have many excellent varieties. For example, Sichuan Province has several excellent varieties such as the high-yielding and disease-resistant Shengli rapeseed, the short-growing cinnabar red rapeseed, and the high oil-yielding Qixingjian. In areas where improved varieties have been cultivated and successfully trialed, it is even more necessary to actively expand the breeding and promotion of improved varieties according to possible conditions. In areas where green manure and rapeseed are intercropped, special attention should be paid to promoting early-maturing and high-yielding varieties, so as not to affect the yield and quality of rapeseed before the green manure is plowed or harvested.

    In order to ensure the development of rapeseed in various growth stages, all localities should attach importance to several major measures such as meticulous land preparation, increasing the application of base fertilizer, timely sowing, and ditching and drainage. Many areas farmers think that rapeseed is a "lazy crop" and do not pay attention to land preparation work. Especially in the lakeside and along the river areas, they often plow without harrowing, and even sow on stubble. Because the soil clods are large and the ground is compacted, the rapeseed seedlings emerge unevenly and grow poorly. This is the main reason for the low rapeseed yield and large plowing area, which must be avoided in the future. In rainy areas, preparations should also be made for ditching and drainage to avoid water accumulation in the fields, which will cause the rapeseed to be soaked, the leaves to turn yellow, and easily lead to disease and frost damage. Rapeseed is a crop that requires a lot of fertilizer. Applying sufficient base fertilizer can ensure the healthy growth of rapeseed seedlings. Last year, many areas lacked base fertilizer, which seriously affected the growth and development of rapeseed. Before rapeseed sowing this year, efforts should be made to open up fertilizer sources, try to apply sufficient base fertilizer, and improve fertilization techniques to promote healthy seedling growth. In addition, all localities should learn from last year's lesson of rapeseed seedlings being frozen due to delayed sowing this year. According to local climatic conditions, timely sowing should be carried out to make the seedlings grow healthily and take root firmly before wintering. In areas where the previous crop is harvested late or is often affected by drought and flood disasters and cannot be sown in time, seedling raising and transplanting can be appropriately promoted to strive for timely sowing; but it is also necessary to prevent sowing too early, so as not to cause pest and disease damage and premature bolting before spring.

    努力完成油菜播种计划
    张止渊
    由于去年灾情影响，油菜播种期延迟，主要产区又遭冻害；加以灾区的耕畜和肥料缺乏、耕作粗放，以致一九五五年油菜增产任务没有完成。为了弥补油料减产的损失，保证人民对食用油的需要，各地必须在今年油菜秋播季节中，发动广大农民，努力完成并争取超额完成今年油菜播种计划。
    进一步扩大利用冬闲田，提倡在绿肥田和蚕豆田间种油菜，这是在不同粮、棉争地的原则下，增产油料的有效办法。据初步估计：全国约有冬闲田一亿亩以上，只要结合兴修水利，积极指导农民改变耕作习惯，在不妨碍大春作物栽培的前提下，选用一部分条件较好的冬闲田扩种油菜，是完全可能的。湖南省计划在今年油菜秋播中，利用冬闲田扩大栽培面积达到四百万亩以上，比去年秋播增加了一百多万亩。其他各省也应充分利用这一有利条件，在原有冬播面积的基础上，适当扩大利用冬闲田，增加油料生产。
    各地的经验证明，实行绿肥田和蚕豆田间种油菜，既不影响绿肥、蚕豆产量，又能增产菜籽，增加农民收益。例如，四川温江专区农民利用苕子（绿肥）田间种油菜，除可收获一般产量的绿肥外，每亩可多收菜籽一百余斤。江西、湖南、湖北、浙江、广西等省，有些农民也有在绿肥田和蚕豆田内间种油菜的习惯，效果也都很好。这些地区应及时总结并交流经验，积极指导农民广泛利用苕子、紫云英、胡豆等同油菜间种，增产油料。
    今年油菜播种任务较大，新发展的地区和绿肥、蚕豆同油菜间作的地区要比以往增多。因此，各地首先要作好种子供应工作，特别应该选择当地早熟丰产的品种加以推广。有些人认为优良品种很少，要扩大良种面积很困难，这是不符合事实的。油菜在我国栽培历史很久，群众中有很多优良品种，例如四川省即有丰产抗病的胜利油菜、生长期短的朱砂红菜籽及出油率高的七星剑等几个优良品种。在良种栽培和试种成功的地区，更要根据可能条件，积极扩大良种的繁殖、推广。在绿肥、油菜间作地区，尤其要注意推广早熟丰产品种，以免绿肥耕翻或收获前油菜尚未成熟，影响菜籽产量及品质。
    为了保证油菜在各个生长阶段的发育，各地应重视精细整地、增施基肥、适期播种，开沟排水等几项主要措施。很多地区农民认为油菜是“懒庄稼”，不重视整地工作，尤其是滨湖沿江地区往往耕而不耙，甚至板茬下种；由于土壤坷垃大、地面板结，以致油菜出苗不齐，生长不良。这是油菜产量低、犁翻面积大的主要原因，今后必须极力避免。在多雨地区，还应作好开沟排水的准备工作，以免田中积水，油菜受渍叶色变黄，容易引起病害和冻灾的损失。油菜是需肥较多的作物，施足基肥，才能保证油菜苗期生长健壮。去年很多地区，由于缺乏底肥，结果，严重地影响了油菜的生长发育。今年油菜播种前，应大力开辟肥源，尽量作到施足底肥，提高施肥技术，以促进幼苗生长健壮。此外，今年各地还应接受去年因播种延迟致使油菜幼苗受冻的教训，根据当地气候条件，适期播种，使幼苗在越冬前即生长健壮，扎根稳固。在前作物收获较晚，或常受旱涝灾害影响不能及时播种的地区，可适当提倡育苗移栽，争取适期下种；但也要防止播种过早，以免引起病虫为害和春前抽苔过早。
