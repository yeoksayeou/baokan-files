Resolutely Support and Implement the Municipal Grain Rationing Measures
Xu Jianguo, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai

The "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Municipalities and Towns" promulgated by the State Council is a major measure to effectively implement the policy of planned grain supply, improve the urban grain supply system, promote grain conservation, and ensure the rational distribution of grain. The implementation of this measure will not only effectively guarantee the essential needs of the state and the people and ensure the smooth progress of national construction, but also control grain sales at a reasonable level, guarantee that the state's grain procurement quota from farmers remains unchanged for three years, promote the development of agricultural production, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The people of Shanghai resolutely support and guarantee the implementation of this major measure of the State Council.

In accordance with the central government's instructions on rectifying urban grain unified sales work and conserving grain, Shanghai has extensively carried out propaganda and education on grain conservation and the policy of unified grain purchase and sales throughout the city. It also implemented a method of verifying grain supply by household starting in May, and in June, it conducted verification work on various grain usages throughout the city. After the rectification, Shanghai's grain sales volume dropped rapidly. The actual grain sales volume in July decreased by 20.24% compared to April, and the grain sold less than in May was enough for 2 million people to eat for a month. Through propaganda and education, the broad masses of residents recognized the great significance of conserving grain for ensuring the rational distribution of grain and accumulating construction funds, and therefore actively created and promoted many methods for conserving grain, which greatly changed the phenomenon of grain waste. For example, more than 9,000 canteens in the city adopted various conservation methods, and the average grain usage figure was reduced by more than 27.5%. In terms of industrial grain usage, many conservation methods have also been created and promoted. Only state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories in the city, while ensuring product quality, can save more than 2 million catties of grain annually by adopting methods such as reducing the sizing rate of cotton yarn and appropriately using substitutes. After the implementation of the method of verifying supply by household, the phenomena of excessively loose grain supply, lax management, grain outflow, etc., have also been changed to some extent. The people generally expressed their support for the government's measures to implement the planned grain supply policy. A worker's family member said: "Before liberation, we couldn't buy rice even if we lined up, and we couldn't afford to buy black market rice. Now it's not too late to buy rice after I light the coal stove. If the state didn't control the grain, how could it guarantee our supply like this?"

However, it should be pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in Shanghai's planned grain supply work, and the phenomena of wasting grain, duplicate grain purchases, falsely reporting population to fraudulently obtain grain, and grain outflow have not been completely eliminated. This shows that the method of verifying supply by household is still not perfect, because there is no fixed standard for each person's grain consumption, and the supply work inevitably produces the problems of being too loose or too tight, and cannot guarantee a reasonable supply. Therefore, it is necessary to take further measures on the basis of verifying supply by household to promote achievements and overcome shortcomings. The "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Municipalities and Towns" promulgated by the State Council is an effective way to fundamentally solve the problem of rational grain supply.

The "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Municipalities and Towns" stipulates that in the future, the supply of staple food for residents will be based on "rationing by person, calculating by household, issuing food coupons by household, and supplying based on coupons." That is to say, appropriate grading supply standards should be set according to the age, labor intensity, and other conditions of the urban population, and supply should be based on coupons. According to the data obtained from interviews, symposiums, investigations, and calculations among 15,387 people in the city in the past month, the staple food classification supply standards stipulated in the central government's grain rationing measures take into account the different needs of various target groups and are reasonable and feasible. Therefore, the worry that there will not be enough grain to eat after the implementation of the rationing measures is unnecessary.

The "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Municipalities and Towns" has been promulgated. The people of Shanghai, like the people of other cities, will guarantee to support and implement this decision of the central government with concrete actions. Now, the task before all citizens of Shanghai is: to further recognize the important significance of implementing grain rationing in ideology, to establish the spirit of being happy to obey the state plan, to eliminate all phenomena such as falsely reporting population to fraudulently obtain grain, duplicate grain purchases, and resolutely fight against illegal hoarding and trafficking, and to supervise grain stores and various grain-using industries to abide by the government's management and regulations. The people of the city must also be vigilant at all times to prevent all sabotage activities by counter-revolutionaries, so as to ensure the smooth implementation of the grain rationing system.

We must also continue to implement the struggle to practice strict economy and oppose waste. Actively promote various effective methods of saving grain in canteens and among residents. In grain-using enterprises, we must strive to save grain in all aspects while ensuring product quality. In all links of grain management, we must improve grain storage and transportation work, strengthen management, and prevent all phenomena of waste and violation of grain laws. Only in this way can we save more grain for the country from all aspects.

The implementation of the grain rationing system will not only guarantee the rational supply of grain in municipalities and towns, but also be conducive to the development of agricultural production, and will further institutionalize China's grain work. Grain workers in Shanghai should work together with the people of the city to strive to ensure the implementation of this important measure. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, with a large population, many industries, and many types of occupational labor. It will encounter some difficulties in implementing grain rationing. However, as long as we closely follow the central government's policies and instructions, conscientiously carry out in-depth political work and meticulous organizational work, and with the assistance of the people of the city, we will surely be able to overcome the various difficulties encountered in our work and do a good job in grain rationing.

### 坚决拥护和贯彻市镇粮食定量供应办法

专栏：拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法

    坚决拥护和贯彻市镇粮食定量供应办法
    上海市副市长　许建国
    国务院公布的“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”，是有效地贯彻粮食计划供应政策，健全市镇粮食供应制度，推动粮食节约，保证粮食合理分配的一项重大措施。这一措施的实行，不但可以切实保证国家和人民必不可少的需要，保证国家建设的顺利进行，而且可以把粮食销售量控制在合理的水平上，保证国家向农民征购粮食的数量三年不变，促进农业生产的发展，巩固工农联盟。我们上海市人民，坚决拥护和保证贯彻国务院的这一重大措施。
    上海市根据中央关于整顿城市粮食统销工作和节约粮食的指示，在全市范围内，广泛地展开了节约粮食和粮食统购统销政策的宣传教育，并且从五月份开始实行了粮食按户核实供应办法，六月份又对全市各种用粮进行了核实工作。经过整顿以后，上海市粮食销售量迅速下降，全市七月份粮食实销售量比四月份减少了百分之二十点二四，比五月份少销售的粮食足够二百万人吃一个月。经过宣传教育，广大居民认识到节约粮食对于保证粮食的合理分配和积累建设资金的重大意义，因而积极创造和推广了许多节约粮食的办法，使粮食浪费的现象有了很大改变。如全市九千多个伙食团，采取了各种节约办法，使用粮数字平均降低了百分之二十七点五多。在工业用粮方面，也创造和推广了许多节约的办法，仅全市国营和公私合营棉纺织厂在保证产品质量的前提下，采用减低棉纱上浆率，适当地使用代用品的办法，每年就可节约粮食二百多万斤。实行按户核实供应的办法之后，粮食供应偏宽，管理松懈，粮食外流等现象，也已经有所改变。人民群众对政府贯彻粮食计划供应政策的措施，普遍表示拥护。一个工人家属说：“解放前排队还买不到米，买黑市米又买不起，现在我生好煤炉再去买米都不迟，不是国家掌握了粮食，那能这样保证给我们供应。”
    但是，应当指出，上海市的粮食计划供应工作还有不少缺点，浪费粮食、重复购粮、虚报人口冒领粮食和粮食外流的现象尚未完全杜绝。这说明，按户核实供应的办法也还是不够完善的，因为各人的粮食消费量没有一定的标准，供应工作上就不免产生偏松偏紧的毛病，不能保证供应合理。因此，必须在按户核实供应的基础上，采取进一步的措施，以发扬成绩，克服缺点。国务院颁布的“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”正是从根本上解决粮食合理供应问题的有效办法。
    “市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”规定，今后居民的口粮供应，采取“以人定量、归户计算、按户发票证、凭票证供应”的办法。就是说，要按照城市人口年龄大小、劳动轻重等情况规定适当的分等供应标准，凭票证供应。根据我们近一个月来在全市一万五千三百八十七人中通过访问、座谈、调查、测算所得的资料来看，中央规定的粮食定量供应办法中所规定的口粮分类供应标准，是照顾了各种不同对象的不同需要的，是合理可行的。因此，怕实行定量供应办法以后粮食不够吃的顾虑是不必要的。
    “市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”已经公布了。上海全市人民将同其他城市人民一样，保证用具体行动来拥护和贯彻中央这一决定。现在，摆在上海市全体市民面前的任务是：在思想上进一步认识实行粮食定量供应的重要意义，人人都树立乐于服从国家计划的精神，消灭一切虚报人口冒领粮食、重复购粮等现象，同非法囤积贩运的违法现象进行坚决的斗争，监督粮店和各用粮行业遵守政府的管理和规定。全市人民还要时刻地提高警惕，防止一切反革命分子的造谣破坏活动，以保证粮食定量供应制度的顺利实施。
    我们还要继续贯彻厉行节约，反对浪费的斗争。在伙食团和居民中积极地推广各种有效的节约用粮的办法。在用粮企业中，要在保证产品质量的前提下，从各方面努力节约粮食。粮食经营方面的各个环节，都要改善粮食保管和调运工作，加强管理，防止一切浪费和破坏粮食法令的现象。只有这样，才能从各方面为国家节约更多的粮食。
    粮食定量供应制度的实施，不但会保证市镇粮食的合理供应，而且将有利于发展农业生产，并将使我国的粮食工作进一步制度化。上海市粮食工作人员应该跟全市人民一起，努力保证贯彻这一重要措施。上海是全国最大的城市，人口多，行业多，职业劳动的种类也多，在实行粮食定量供应工作中是会碰到一些困难的。但是只要我们紧紧遵循着中央的政策和指示，兢兢业业地进行深入的政治工作和细致的组织工作，在全市人民的协助下，我们一定能够克服工作中碰到的各种困难，把粮食定量供应工作做好。
