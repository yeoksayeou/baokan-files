Xin'an Village in Shanyang Township, Caojing District, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, recently carried out the "Grain Three-Fixes" implementation to households. This has powerfully promoted current production and the development of agricultural cooperatives. At the beginning of implementing the "Three-Fixes" to households, many farmers were still skeptical about the policy. Some farmers said: "The 'Three-Fixes' sounds good, but I don't know how much they will purchase from me in the end!" Some members of the Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative said: "No matter how well we produce, the unified purchase will still increase anyway." After publicizing the policy and specifically fixing the production, purchase, and sales figures to each household, the farmers' mood changed significantly. They generally supported the policy and actively engaged in production. Farmers like Li Asan originally had twenty-two mu of "vegetarian fields" (fields without fertilizer application). After hearing the publicity about the "Three-Fixes" to households, they immediately bought more than one hundred catties of fertilizer powder, ready to apply to these fields. The day after the "Three-Fixes" figures were posted, the whole village purchased more than two thousand five hundred catties of fertilizer powder and applied it to the fields. Cooperative members Wu Qinyu and Wu Xingen of the Sanlian Cooperative originally had low production enthusiasm and complained about heavy work in the cooperative. They had not worked for half a month, but after the "Three-Fixes" to households, they actively went to work. All production teams in the cooperative originally thought that agricultural work was relatively slack and the working hours were late and short. After the "Three-Fixes" to households, they started work early and finished late, full of energy. The whole village also collected more than thirty burlap sacks and prepared for flood control. Every household prepared lamps to control rice borers. Woman Chen Meibao said: "This year, with the implementation of the 'Three-Fixes', we can keep more if we harvest more. We will definitely step up production." Some women spontaneously organized themselves to vigorously cut off withered heart seedlings.

After the "Three-Fixes" was implemented to households, it not only promoted production but also promoted the development of the cooperative movement. Farmer Gu Shougen, seeing that the "Three-Fixes" had been fixed, urgently requested to join the cooperative. Out of the one hundred and four households in the whole village, in addition to the original two agricultural cooperatives, a new cooperative was recently established. A total of eighty-three households in the village participated in the cooperatives. Farmer Shen Axin said it well: "The 'Three-Fixes' policy is really good. It remains unchanged for three years, so farmers can concentrate on production, improve their lives every year, and the country can also handle affairs according to the fixed figures. Socialist construction will be more planned."

    新庵村粮食三定到户农民积极生产
    龚樾苏
    江苏省松江县漕泾区山阳乡新庵村，最近进行了粮食三定到户的工作，有力地推动了当前生产和发展农业合作社的工作。开始贯彻三定到户时，很多农民对政策仍有怀疑，有些农民说：三定听听倒满好，不知到底向我购多少？三联农业合作社个别社员说：搞好了生产，统购时反正还要增加的。经过宣传政策，具体把产购销数字定到户，农民情绪显著变化，普遍拥护政策，积极生产。农民李阿三等本来有二十二亩“吃素田”（未施肥料的田），听了三定到户宣传后，立刻又买了一百多斤肥田粉，准备施到这些地里。三定数字张榜公布第二天，全村就购进了二千五百多斤肥田粉，追施到田里。三联社社员吴勤余、吴新根等本来生产情绪不高，嫌社里干活重，有半个月不上工了，三定到户后，积极出工。全社各生产队本来认为目前农事较闲，出工时间又迟又短，三定到户后，早上工，晚下工，劲头十足。全村还集中了三十多只麻袋，做好了防汛工作。户户备灯治螟。妇女陈美宝说：今年实行三定，多收多留，我们一定加紧搞好生产。有些妇女自动组织起来，大力剪除枯心苗。
    三定贯彻到户后，不但推动了生产，而且促进了合作化运动的发展。农民顾寿根看到三定已定好，迫切要求入社。全村一百○四户，除原有二个农业合作社外，最近又新建了一个社，全村共有八十三户参加了社。农民沈阿新说得好：三定政策真好。三年不变，农民可以安心生产，生活可以年年提高，国家也可根据既定数字办事，社会主义建设也就更有计划。
