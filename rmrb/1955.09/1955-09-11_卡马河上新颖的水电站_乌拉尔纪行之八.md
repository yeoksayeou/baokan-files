    Novel Hydroelectric Station on the Kama River
    —An Ural Travelogue, Part 8
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow
    When the Moscow-Beijing direct train passes near Molotov City, it crosses the Kama River, a tributary of the Volga. The Kama Hydroelectric Station is being built not far from there. It is a project of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan. The novelty of the project has attracted people's attention.
    The construction site is some distance from Molotov City. Along the way, the Kama River stretches up and down. The width of the river is no less than the Pearl River in our country. Ships are crowded at the docks on the riverbank near Molotov City. Last spring, when the hydroelectric station's reservoir was first impounded, the water level rose to thirteen meters, and the area expanded to one thousand seven hundred square kilometers. In the sea-like reservoir, oil derricks stand tall. That is the Polaznensky oil enterprise. These oil wells, which used to be on land, have now become riverbed oil wells. Along the reservoir's shore, many places where only small boats could pass in the past are now smoothly navigated by steamers, tugboats, barges, and rafts.
    The water transport on the Kama River is very developed, especially the transportation of timber. The Molotov Oblast in the Soviet Union is famous for its abundant timber, paper, mineral fertilizers, coal, and metal production. Every year, eight or nine million cubic meters of timber and several million tons of industrial products are transported across the country via the Kama River. In order to meet economic needs, Soviet engineers and workers have, for the first time in the history of world hydraulic engineering construction, created a navigation lock that ensures the smooth transportation of such a large volume of goods. Anatoly Vasiliev, the chief engineer of the hydroelectric station, took me to the lock. It is two parallel "water ladders"—waterways—more than kilometers long. Each waterway consists of six interconnected lock chambers (i.e., a section of the lock). The lock chambers are separated by rapidly descending iron gates, each gate covering an area of ​​three hundred square meters and weighing more than two hundred and fifty tons. When ships pass through each lock chamber, they rise or fall three and a half meters. The Volga-Don Canal and other previously built waterways are single-track, while the Kama lock is double-track, which greatly enhances transportation capacity. The Kama lock, with a water level difference of twenty-one meters, is divided into six chambers, allowing three chambers to pass simultaneously, which improves navigation efficiency and reduces river water loss. Among the parallel locks stands a square tower-shaped building seventy meters high, with a five-pointed star shining at its top. This is the central control station, which controls the gates and directs the passage of ships and rafts.
    The walls inside the lock are not made of reinforced concrete, but of steel plates, because the quicksand on the river bank here is extremely thick. From May onwards, rafts entering the lock are pulled by electric locomotives. This is also an innovation. A total of sixteen kilometers of rails have been laid on both sides of the two parallel waterways, with electric locomotives placed there. It takes twelve minutes for a tugboat to pull a raft through a lock chamber, but only four minutes with an electric locomotive, and the raft can be enlarged by a quarter.
    The most novel thing is the construction of the hydroelectric station itself. Where is the hydroelectric station building? Only a large bridge-like reinforced concrete spillway dam can be seen blocking the Kama River, most of which has already been built. Following the chief engineer, I passed through the tunnel under the riverbed, turned to the already installed eighteenth turbine, walked into the first batch of turbine power generation halls that were already working, and finally went up to the spillway dam to the place where the cranes for installing the turbine generators move. We almost walked through the entire hydroelectric station building. It turned out that it was inside the spillway dam. Clever Soviet engineers and workers utilized the twenty-one meter water level difference to install the turbine generators inside the dam. Such a building saves more than half of the reinforced concrete.
    A total of twenty-four turbine generators will be installed in the spillway dam. These are hydraulic generators with small bodies but great capabilities. Together, they will generate electricity equal to half of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station. I saw the manufacturing of these turbine generators at the Ural Electrical Machinery Plant in Sverdlovsk. This factory is one of the largest electrical machinery plants established by the Soviet Union during the period of national industrialization. It now produces more than two hundred kinds of electrical machinery. General turbine generators are three stories high. The turbine generator used for the Kama River, in order to adapt to the spillway dam, is only two stories high. This type of turbine generator has no support frame, and its rotating part is directly supported on top of the turbine. The stator of the turbine is the base of the entire linkage machine. The shaft of the turbine and generator is common, so the entire linkage machine is relatively short. This turbine has single-flow rotor blades, and the water flow can maintain its direction after passing through, so the working efficiency is relatively high. The Kama Hydroelectric Station installed six turbine generators in 1954 and will install nine in 1955. The installation workers assemble the various parts of the turbine generator in the work yard near the spillway dam, and then use a crane with a strong lifting force to place it inside the dam. This installation is relatively fast. Before the second batch of turbine generators were installed, the first batch was already working. As we walked through this automated turbine hall, the chief engineer said: "We are now about ten meters below the upper water level." The construction of the Kama Hydroelectric Station will be completed in 1955. Its scale is very considerable. In the past three years, one million one hundred thousand cubic meters of reinforced concrete have been poured here, fifteen million cubic meters of soil have been moved, and more than sixty thousand tons of metal structures and steel plates have been installed and driven. This year, another two hundred thousand cubic meters of reinforced concrete will be poured, two million seven hundred thousand cubic meters of soil will be moved, and eleven thousand tons of metal structures will be installed. Like other construction sites, this place is also equipped with many construction machines and has established a strong "rear area". When the project was fully underway, eight dredgers, thirty excavators, several large cranes, hundreds of trucks, tractors, bulldozers, concrete pumps, and other machines were active on the construction site. The "rear area" has two automated concrete factories, two steel factories, a machine repair factory, a wood factory, and two quarries. All earthwork on the construction site will be completed this year, and a large amount of mud flows through the dredger's delivery pipes every day. Therefore, an instrument called a radiation mud meter is used, using the radioactive isotope of cobalt, to continuously inspect and manage the mud slurry during the operation of the dredger. This inspection is of great help in managing complex machines and improving their productivity. The builders of the hydroelectric station rely on these powerful and advanced technologies and equipment to bravely solve problems and successfully complete tasks. Here, the production innovator Chelebanov, in cooperation with the engineers, used high-frequency electric vibrators to drive steel plates into the mud on a large scale for the first time in hydraulic construction, burying fifteen meters every three or four minutes. The concrete workers Oshmarin, Vudin, Novikov, and Mochalov's production team widely used pumps to pour concrete. Forty percent of the concrete on the construction site is poured using this method. The pump can send forty cubic meters of concrete per hour. Concrete can be delivered up to two hundred meters through the delivery pipe. The concrete pump works very well at minus ten to fifteen degrees Celsius, and even works well at minus thirty-five degrees Celsius.
    After the Kama Hydroelectric Station is completed, the water level of the reservoir will rise to twenty-one meters, and the area will expand to approximately two thousand square kilometers. In some places, it will be twenty-five to thirty kilometers wide. From the dam to Solikamsk City in the north, about three hundred kilometers will be vast river water. This "Kama Sea" will be six times larger than the Moscow River reservoir. On the dam of the hydroelectric station and on the bridges of the navigation locks, highways will be opened. The multi-story residential buildings, schools, and cultural and recreational places for construction workers that have appeared near the hydroelectric station have already formed the prototype of the Kama Hydroelectric Station New Area of Molotov City.
    The creation of the Kama Sea will make the Kama River a deep-water route and allow many tributaries of the Kama River to be navigable, which is of great significance to the Kama River basin, which is rich in industrial products. More importantly, the Kama Hydroelectric Station is the first large-scale hydroelectric power station in the Urals. The Urals has many powerful thermal power plants. I visited such a power plant in Berezniki, which uses Kizel coal to generate electricity. The electricity generated by the Kama Hydroelectric Station using "white coal" is the lowest in cost. The electricity generated by the Kama Hydroelectric Station will be added to the Ural power grid. It will greatly strengthen the power supply to industrial enterprises in the Molotov Oblast, Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Chelyabinsk Oblast. Power metallurgy, metal processing using high-frequency current, electric welding, and other departments that require electricity will be further developed. Many collective farms and machine tractor stations in Molotov Oblast will supplement their electricity. It will be possible to electrify the railways from Molotov City to Sverdlovsk and near Molotov City and Kizel City.

    卡马河上新颖的水电站
    ——乌拉尔纪行之八
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    莫斯科—北京直达火车经过莫洛托夫市附近的时候，要越过伏尔加河的支流卡马河。卡马水电站就是在离那里不远的地方建筑的。它是苏联第五个五年计划时期内的工程。工程的新颖吸引了人们的注意。
    工地离莫洛托夫市有一段路。沿路看到卡马河上下伸展着。河面的宽阔不亚于我国的珠江。靠莫洛托夫市这边的河岸码头上麇集着船只。去年春天，水电站的水库才拦蓄的时候，水位提高到十三公尺，面积扩大到一千七百平方公里。在海一样的大水库里，矗立着石油塔架。那是波拉兹连斯基石油企业。这些过去陆地上的采油井现在变成河底采油井了。水库沿岸许多过去只能走小船的地方，现在畅通无阻地走着轮船、拖船、驳船和木排。
    卡马河的水运很发达，特别是木材的运输。莫洛托夫州在苏联是以盛产木材、纸、矿质肥料、煤和金属出名的。每年有八、九百万立方公尺的木材和几百万吨的工业产品经过卡马河运到全国各地去。为着适应经济上的需要，苏联的工程师和工人在世界水利工程建筑史中，第一次创建了保证这样大量货物的顺利运输的航行水闸。水电站总工程师阿纳托里·瓦西里也夫带我到水闸跟前。它是两公里多长的两条平行的“水梯”——航道。每条航道由六个衔接的水闸室（即一段水闸）组成。水闸室由迅速向下落的铁门隔开，每扇铁门面积三百平方公尺、重二百五十吨以上。船只驶过每个水闸室的时候，上升或下降三个半公尺。伏尔加河—顿河运河和其他以前建筑的航道都是单线的，卡马水闸是双线的，这就大大加强了运输能力。水位差二十一公尺的卡马水闸分为六个室，使得三个室可以同时通行，既提高航运的效率，又降低河水的损失。在平行的水闸当中，耸立着七十公尺高的方塔形的建筑物，它的顶端闪耀着五角金星。这是中央管理站，它操纵闸门和指挥船只木排的通行。
    水闸内的墙壁不是钢筋混凝土的，而是钢板的，因为这里河岸的流砂极厚。进入水闸的木排，从五月起用电力机车来拉。这也是独创的。在两条平行的航道的两岸，已经铺好总共十六公里铁轨，放着电力机车。用拖船拉木排，通过一个水闸室要十二分钟，用电力机车只要四分钟，而且可以把木排加大四分之一。
    最新颖的是水电站本身的建筑。水电站建筑物在那里呢？只看见一座大桥般的钢筋混凝土的溢水堤坝挡住卡马河水，堤坝大部分已经筑成。我随着总工程师穿过河床底下的隧道，折到已经安装好的第十八座透平机脚下，走进已经在工作的第一批透平发电厅，最后上到溢水堤坝上面安装透平发电机的吊车活动的地方。我们几乎走遍了水电站建筑物。原来它就在溢水堤坝里面。聪明的苏联工程师和工人利用二十一公尺的水位差，把透平发电机安装在堤坝里面。这样的建筑物节约钢筋混凝土一半以上。
    在溢水堤坝里总共将安装二十四部透平发电机。这些是机身不大但是能力很大的水力发电机。它们总共将发出等于半个卡霍夫卡水电站的电力。我在斯维尔德洛夫斯克的乌拉尔电机制造厂看到这些透平发电机的制造。这个工厂是苏联在国家工业化时期建立的最大的电机制造厂之一。它现在生产着二百多种电力机器。一般透平发电机有三层楼高。卡马河用的透平发电机，为了适应溢水堤坝，只有两层楼高。这种透平发电机没有支架，它的旋转部分直接支在透平顶上，透平的固定子便是整个联动机的机座，透平和发电机的轴，是共同的，所以整个联动机比较短。这种透平是单流转叶的，水流过后可以不变方向，所以工作效率比较高。卡马水电站在一九五四年安装了六部透平发电机，一九五五年将安装九部。安装工人在靠近溢水堤坝的工作场里，把透平发电机各个部分装配妥当，然后用起重力强大的吊车把它安置在堤坝内。这样的安装比较快。在安装第二批透平发电机以前，第一批已经在工作了。当我们在这自动化的透平厅走过的时候，总工程师说：“我们现在是处在上流水位底下约十公尺的地方。”卡马水电站的建筑工程，将在一九五五年完成。它的规模是很可观的。过去三年中，在这里灌了一百一十万立方公尺钢筋混凝土，移了一千五百万立方公尺土，装了和打了六万多吨金属结构和钢板。今年还要灌二十万立方公尺钢筋混凝土，移二百七十万立方公尺土，装一万一千吨金属结构。像其他工地一样，这里也装备了许多建筑机器和建立了有力的“后方”。在工程全面展开的时候，工地上活动着八部吸泥机、三十部挖掘机、几部大吊车、几百辆卡车、拖拉机、推土机、混凝土唧筒和其他机器。“后方”有两座自动化的混凝土工厂、两座钢筋工厂、一座机械修理厂、一座木材厂和两座采石厂。工地上所有土工在今年都要完成，每天有大量泥浆流过吸泥机的输送管。所以使用一种叫做射线测泥器的仪器，利用钴的放射性同位素，在吸泥机工作当中不断地检查管理泥浆的情况。这种检查对于管理复杂的机器和提高它们的生产率大有帮助。水电站的建筑者们就是依靠这些强大的和先进的技术设备，勇敢地解决问题，顺利地完成任务的。这里的生产革新者切列班诺夫在工程师们合作之下，在水利建筑中第一次大规模地使用高频率的电力振动器把钢板打进泥土里，每三、四分钟埋十五公尺。混凝土工人奥什马林、伏丁、诺维科夫、莫查洛夫的生产队广泛地用唧筒灌混凝土。工地上百分之四十的混凝土是用这个方法灌的。唧筒每小时可以送四十立方公尺混凝土。混凝土经过输送管可以送到二百公尺远。混凝土唧筒在零下十度到十五度工作得很好，甚至在零下三十五度还能很好工作。
    在卡马水电站建成之后，水库的水位将提高到二十一公尺，面积将扩大到约二千平方公里，个别地方将宽到二十五到三十公里，从堤坝直到北面苏里卡木斯克市约三百公里都将是汪洋的河水。这个“卡马海”将有莫斯科河的水库的六倍大。在水电站的堤坝上，在航行水闸的桥梁上，将开辟汽车路。水电站附近出现的建筑工人的多层楼住宅、学校和文化娱乐场所，已经构成莫洛托夫市卡马水电站新区的雏形。
    卡马海的产生，使卡马河成为深水的航线，使卡马河许多支流都可以通航，这对于工业产品丰富的卡马河流域是有重要意义的。更重要的，卡马水电站是乌拉尔第一座巨大的水力发电站。乌拉尔有许多强大的火力发电厂。我在别列兹尼奇到过这样一个发电厂，它利用基泽尔的煤来发电。卡马水电站利用“白煤”发的电力是成本最低的。卡马水电站发的电力，将添加到乌拉尔发电网去。它将大大加强对莫洛托夫州、斯维尔德洛夫斯克州、车里雅宾斯克州的工业企业的电力供应。电力冶金，用高频率电流对金属加工，电焊以及其他需用电力的部门，将得到进一步发展。莫洛托夫州的许多集体农庄和机器拖拉机站将补充电力。莫洛托夫市到斯维尔德洛夫斯克以及莫洛托夫市、基泽尔市附近的铁路将有可能电气化。
