Make a Good Job of Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities

    Eat Your Stored Grain, Then Buy New Grain
    Cai Jianyuan
    Residents of the Luban Guan police station district in Chongwen District, Beijing, having suffered from the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants and soaring grain prices for a long time in the old society, developed the habit of "saving a little grain whenever they had some money." Now, seeing that the unified purchase and sale of grain has been implemented for nearly two years, and grain prices are stable, they have begun to pilot the method of grain rationing from August, ensuring reasonable supply. They have consciously changed this habit and are willing to eat their stored grain before buying new grain.
    There is a worker named Tang Qizhong who works at the private Yu Sheng Towel Factory. He, along with two other workers, Li Jizong and Guo Yongze, the manager and his wife, and two children, a total of seven people, eat together, and they have a bag of flour stored for their meals. In August, grain was supplied according to the per capita quota, and they purchased a total of 228 jin. Tang Qizhong calculated that the 205 jin from July, although a bit tight, was enough to get by. Now that it has increased by 23 jin, it is more than enough. From now on, there will be a certain amount of grain purchased every month, and there is no need to consider and verify the plan month after month as in the past. "Eat what you buy in the current month, no need to eat old grain at all!" Tang Qizhong was happy from the bottom of his heart. He once again raised the issue of taking out the stored bag of flour with the manager. The manager no longer rejected it immediately as in July, but simply replied, "You can decide," and after a pause, the manager said, "Take it out, it's useless to store it." Li Jizong added from the side, "Take out the stored grain." Guo Yongze did not express any objection. The manager's wife did not speak, but her expression was not as unpleasant as last time. The reason is that everyone's concerns about "not having enough to eat" have been eliminated, and no one can give a reason to store grain anymore. Tang Qizhong happily told the resident group leader that the bag of flour stored in their Yu Sheng Towel Factory had been taken out to eat, and they would buy 50 jin less grain in August according to the quota.
    There is a cadre's family member named Li Xiuling. Her husband works in the grain department, and she has five children, a total of seven people eating. From January to May this year, her family purchased an average of 125 jin of grain per month. In June, when planning grain purchases by household, her family was allocated 122 jin, and they ate more than ten jin of stored grain to get to the end of the month, which made her a little annoyed. In July, when planning grain purchases by household, she and her husband calculated: she said that they need to eat two and a half jin of flour and two and a half jin of rice every day, and the grain for the fifth child (under one year old) has not been included, so at least 150 jin per month. She thought that this way she could avoid using stored grain and could save some more. Her husband didn't mention storing grain, but said:
  "That won't work. There are times when you eat less, and there are times when you eat coarse grains, how can you calculate five jin every day?" She replied, "150 jin is not enough!" and said sharply, "You don't cook, you don't know!" The couple argued. After attending the street meeting on planning grain purchases, she still did not change her mind. However, her husband still insisted on ordering the same amount as in June, because he was not afraid of not being able to buy grain, and he was not afraid of grain price increases, so why store grain? He said to her, "If there's not enough to eat, eat the stored grain." The comrades from the work team also knew that her family had stored grain and agreed with her husband's opinion, approving their family to order 122 jin. She reluctantly agreed. In August, the method of per capita grain supply was implemented, and her family could buy 138 jin, which was enough to eat. At this time, she recalled what her husband had said to her on weekdays: "The methods issued by the People's Government are all for the people's sake." She also thought, "Now, even how much grain each person needs to eat each month is calculated clearly, it's really great." She fully understood the reason her husband said: if every family in the country stores dozens of jin of grain without eating it, what an alarming amount of backlog it would be! She automatically told the residents' committee that she would take out the grain she still had in storage to eat, and her family would buy 20 jin less in August.
    There is an old lady named Zhang Guisheng, whose husband is a carpenter. She said that she was "a thrifty person since she was a young girl," and "she would never touch the money she had saved at the bottom of the box." After her husband died in 1953, she often took apart and washed quilts and cotton clothes for others, or helped families when women gave birth, and slowly saved some money. After the implementation of unified grain sales, each person had a fixed eight jin of flour tickets per month, which made her compare it to the scene of squeezing to buy "mixed flour" during the Japanese occupation. Although she herself was reluctant to eat white flour, she felt that white flour was cute when she saw it, so she bought a few jin every month, and by January of this year, she had accumulated four bags of flour. There are seven people in her family: her son who works in the shoe production cooperative and her brother who does carpentry work do not eat at home; she, her daughter-in-law, and three children, five people, have been eating together since February of this year. When planning grain purchases by household in June, her family ordered 160 jin. The same amount was ordered in July, and the work team found that the order was too small, and suggested whether to increase it a little. Because she had stored grain, and could eat it secretly if it was not enough, but she was embarrassed to say it, so she said, "You decide, whatever amount is fine." The work team increased the order to 174 jin. In August, the method of per capita quota was piloted, and the seven people totaled 190 jin, of which more than two bags of flour could be bought. She calculated: "Oh! Two bags of white flour every month, how can we eat that much!" She also looked at the more than three bags of flour she had stored, some of which were already a little damp, what would happen if she continued to store them! She quietly ran to ask the resident group leader: "Can I not buy white flour in August? I still have more than three bags of white flour, I'll eat two bags this month, and the rest in September." The group leader said: "Of course, you should eat your stored grain first." In August, her family bought three jin of soybeans within the 100 jin quota, and as a result, bought 97 jin less.
    There is a housewife named Li Yuzhen. She, her own child, her sister and a child, and her younger brother's child, plus her old mother, a total of six people eat together. Other people in the family eat out. In June and July, when planning grain purchases by household, Li Yuzhen ordered 125 jin herself, and the work team increased it to 130 jin, which was just enough to eat. In August, according to the per capita quota, the six people totaled 133 jin. Li Yuzhen said: "It's no problem to save three or five jin a month." At this time, she remembered the white flour she had saved up every month, weighed it, and it totaled 107 jin. The reason why she saved a little white flour every month was to "prepare for a relative to come and make dumplings, which is convenient." Li Yuzhen thought: in fact, the grain she bought every month was enough to eat, and some white flour was left over every month. In the future, there will be no problem with the per capita quota, and there is only one result if you continue to store white flour: you will accumulate a certain amount of income every month, and you will also worry about being damp and wormy. She also thought: "If there is a surplus in the per capita quota, people will take it out to adjust to those who don't have enough. We are not grain speculators and profiteers, what are we doing storing hundreds of jin of grain?" So she said to her sister and mother: "Let's not buy white flour this month, let's take out what we have stored to eat." Her sister had no objection, but her mother said: "Buy a little!" After Li Yuzhen told her mother the reason why there was no benefit in storing grain, her mother agreed with her opinion: buy 107 jin less.
    There is a small oil and salt shop called "Huiyuan Store," which is run by Wang Dechang and his wife. They have five children, a total of seven people living. In May and June this year, they stored 50 jin of rice and 50 jin of flour. After that, his family had an extra habit: his wife often went to the steamed bun shop to buy some steamed buns to take back. Was it really because they didn't have time to cook and wanted to buy steamed buns to eat, or was it to show that they didn't have grain at home and went to buy steamed buns to eat? The neighbors guessed half and half. In June and July, when planning grain purchases by household, his family ordered 150 jin every month. In August, the method of per capita quota was piloted, and the seven people totaled 148 jin. Wang Dechang said that with careful calculation, it was enough to eat. One day, a member of the residents' committee went to ask: is it enough to eat, is there any extra? Wang Dechang's wife replied: "There is no extra, we just buy steamed buns to eat." The couple talked about this at night. The husband knew that his family had enough grain according to the per capita quota, and advocated taking out what had already been stored to eat. He also talked about the benefits of a stable grain price after the implementation of unified grain sales, and the fact that storing grain was useless. Later, his wife ran to the resident committee member and said, "We have stored one hundred and ten jin of grain, and we plan to eat it together."
    The examples are endless. Eating stored grain and then buying new grain is a concrete manifestation of the residents' practical actions to support the grain rationing method. There are 2,347 households in the Luban Guan police station district. According to incomplete statistics, 47 households have taken out stored grain to eat, totaling 1,480 jin.

### 吃完存粮，再买新粮

专栏：作好市镇粮食定量供应工作

    吃完存粮，再买新粮
    蔡鉴远
    北京市崇文区鲁班馆派出所辖区的居民，由于在旧社会曾经长期身受奸商剥削和粮价飞涨的痛苦，养成了“有个钱就要存点粮食”的习惯；如今，他们看到实行粮食统购统销将近两年，粮价稳定，从八月份起，又开始试行粮食定量供应办法，保证合理供应，他们已自觉地改变这个习惯，愿意吃完存粮，再买新粮。
    有一位工人，他叫唐启忠，在私营玉生毛巾厂做工。他和另外两位工人李继宗、郭永则，经理夫妻和两个孩子，共七个人一起开伙，在他们的伙食上存着一袋面粉。八月份粮食按人定量供应，他们合计购得二百二十八斤。唐启忠盘算，七月份的二百零五斤，虽然紧一点，也吃过来了；现在增加了二十三斤，足足有余了。以后每月购粮都有一定的数目，不用像过去那样月月考虑计划核定得实不实的问题了。“吃现月的买现月的，根本不用吃陈粮了！”唐启忠从心里高兴。他再一次向经理提出把存着的一袋面粉拿出来吃的问题。经理不再像七月里那样立刻给碰回来，而只是回答：“你瞧着办吧，”停了一下，经理又说：“拿就拿出来，存着也没用。”李继宗在旁边补一句：“把存粮拿出来吧。”郭永则没表示反对意见。经理的妻子没说话，可是脸色不像上次那样难看。原因是谁的心里也消除了“怕不够吃”的顾虑，谁也说不出再要存粮食的理由了。唐启忠高兴地去告诉居民小组长，他们玉生毛巾厂存着的一袋面粉已经拿出来吃，八月份照定量的数字，他们少买五十斤粮食。
    有一位干部家属，她叫李秀玲。她丈夫在粮食部门工作，还有五个孩子，共七个人吃饭。今年一月到五月份，她家平均每月购粮一百二十五斤。六月份按户订购粮计划，她家是一百二十二斤，吃了十来斤存粮才吃到月底的，她感到有点恼火。七月份按户订计划时，她和丈夫算账：她说，每天要吃二斤半面粉，二斤半大米，第五个孩子（不满周岁）的粮食还没打在数，所以每月至少一百五十斤。她心想这样可以不再动用存粮，还可以再剩下一部分积存起来。她丈夫没提存粮的事，只说：
  “这不行。有吃少的时候，还有吃粗粮的时候，那能每天算五斤？”她回答：“订一百五十斤还不够哩！”并厉声说：“你不做饭，你不知道！”夫妻俩吵起来。在参加过街道上关于订购粮计划的会以后，她还是没有改变自己的想法。可是她丈夫仍然坚持同六月份一样订，理由是：一不怕买不到粮食，二不怕粮涨价，还老存着粮食干什么？他对她说：“不够吃，吃存粮。”工作组同志也知道她家还有存粮，同意她丈夫的意见，批准他们家订一百二十二斤。她委曲地答应下来。八月份实行按人定量供应办法，她家可买一百三十八斤，足够吃。这时，她回想起了丈夫平日对她说的话：“人民政府出的办法没有不为人民着想的。”她又想：“现在连一个人每月需要吃多少粮食，也给算的清清楚楚，真是太好了。”她完全懂得了丈夫说的道理：要全国每家人都存下几十斤粮食不吃，该是一笔多惊人的积压账呵！她自动告诉居民委员会，她把现时还存着的粮食拿出来吃，八月份她家少买二十斤。
    有一位老大娘，她叫张贵生，丈夫是木匠。她说，她是“打从做闺女起就是会过日子的人”，是“有个钱沉了箱子底就不随便去动的人”。一九五三年丈夫死了以后，她常给人家拆洗被子和棉衣，或者谁家妇女生孩子她给帮帮忙，慢慢地积下了几个钱。实行粮食统销以后，每人每月固定有八斤面票，她不由得对比起日本鬼子侵占时期挤买“混合面”的情景。虽然她自己舍不得吃白面，可是看到白面又觉得可爱，于是就每月买下几斤，到今年一月里，共积存了四袋面粉。她家七个人：在鞋子生产合作社做工的儿子和做木匠活的兄弟不在家吃饭；她、儿媳妇和三个孩子，五个人从今年二月起在一起吃饭。六月份订按户购粮计划时，她家订了一百六十斤。七月份又订同样数目，工作组发觉订得太少，向她提议是否增加一点，她因为自己有存粮，不够可以背着吃，但又不好意思说出来，就说：“你们看吧，多少就多少。”工作组给增订为一百七十四斤。八月份试行按人定量的办法，七口合计一百九十斤，其中可以买两袋多面粉。她算计：“呵！每月两袋白面，那吃得了！”她又看了看存下的面粉还有三袋多，有的已经有点发潮了，要再存下去咋办呵！她悄悄跑去问居民小组长：“八月份俺不买白面行不？俺还有三袋多白面，这月搭着吃两袋，剩下的九月份搭着吃。”小组长说：“当然行。有存粮是该先尽存粮吃。”八月份她家因为在一百斤的数内已经买了三斤黄豆，结果是少买九十七斤。
    有一个家庭主妇，她叫李玉振。她和自己的一个孩子，她姐姐和一个孩子，还有她弟弟的一个孩子，再加上老母亲，共六个人一起吃饭。家里别的人在外吃饭。六、七月份按户订购粮计划，李玉振自订一百二十五斤，工作组给增到一百三十斤，结果刚够吃。八月份按人定量，六口合计一百三十三斤。李玉振说：“一月节余三、五斤没问题。”这时她想起了以前每月积存下来的白面，秤一秤，共计一百零七斤。以前所以每月积下一点白面，是因为“预备来个亲戚，包顿饺子吃方便些”。李玉振想：事实上每月买的粮食都够吃，白面也每月剩下一些，今后按人定量更没问题，再把白面存下去只有一个结果：积压了每月一定的收入，还担心要受潮、要生虫。她又想：“按人定量有节余的，人家还拿出来调剂给不够吃的，咱又不是投机倒把的粮食奸商，存下百十来斤粮食干啥？”于是她对姐姐和母亲说：“咱这月甭买白面，把存下的拿出来吃吧。”姐姐没意见，母亲却说：“稍买点吧！”李玉振把存下粮食没好处的理由给母亲讲了以后，母亲也就同意她的意见：少买一百零七斤。
    有一个小油盐店叫“惠远号”，是王德昌夫妻俩经营的。他们有五个孩子，共七个人生活。今年五、六月间，他们存下大米五十斤、面粉五十斤。这以后，他家多了一个习惯：他妻子常常上馒头铺买一些馒头拿回来。到底是因为没工夫做饭要买馒头吃，还是为了表示家里没粮食而去买馒头吃？邻居们一样猜一半。六、七月份订按户购粮计划，他家每月都订一百五十斤。八月份试行按人定量，七口合计一百四十八斤，王德昌说精打细算一下，也够吃了。一天，居民委员去问：够不够吃，有没有多余的？王德昌的妻子回答：“可没多余的哟，俺尽买馒头吃。”夜里夫妻俩谈这件事。丈夫知道自己家里按人定量的粮食是够吃的，主张把已经存下的拿出来吃。他又从实行粮食统销以后，粮价更加稳定的实例讲到按人定量供应的好处和存粮没有啥用的道理。后来，他的妻子就跑去找居民委员会委员说：“俺存有百十来斤粮食，俺准备搭着吃。”
    例子举不完，吃完存粮再买新粮，这就是居民们用实际行动拥护粮食定量供应办法的具体表现。鲁班馆派出所辖区共有居民二千三百四十七户，根据不完全统计，拿出存粮来吃的已经有四十七户，合计一千四百八十斤。
