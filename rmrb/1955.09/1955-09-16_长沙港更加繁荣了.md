In the Bumper Harvest Season

    Changsha Port More Prosperous
    As Hunan's rice is being harvested in large quantities, Changsha City, Hunan Province's transportation hub, is also becoming more prosperous.

    On the wide Xiang River, thousands of wooden boats and steamers come and go every day, fully loaded with grain, cloth, general merchandise, etc., transforming the Xiang River bank, which stretches fifteen li along Changsha City, into a bustling marketplace. Thousands of trucks speed along the riverside avenue. At the thirty-plus large and small docks along the Xiang River in Changsha Port and in the nearby warehouses, grain and various agricultural products from the countryside are piled up, along with cloth, general merchandise, and other supplies waiting to be transported to the countryside. The more than three thousand dockworkers originally stationed at Changsha Port are now insufficient to handle the workload. The total volume of goods imported and exported through Changsha Port in August was more than 188,000 tons, more than double that of July, and 41 percent more than the same period last year.

    Since the beginning of autumn, Hunan Province, from the Dongting Lake plain to the Nanling Mountains, has presented a scene of abundant harvest everywhere. Following the bumper harvest of early rice, the middle rice crop has also yielded a bumper harvest. The new grain that farmers are selling to the state is being concentrated at Changsha Port, boatload after boatload, from various lakes, streams, and river ports. In August, more than 110,000 tons of grain were transported to Changsha Port, 11 percent more than the same period in the bumper harvest year of 1953. With the bumper rice harvest, farmers in various regions need to buy more cloth, general merchandise, and other daily necessities than in previous years. In August, the state-owned commercial departments of Hunan Province shipped out various types of cloth, general merchandise, and other supplies that were marketable in rural areas through Changsha Port, two to three times more than in the same period last year.

    长沙港更加繁荣了
    湖南稻谷正在大量登场，湖南省物资集散枢纽的长沙市也跟着更加繁荣了。
    在宽阔的湘江上，每天有成千上万只木船、轮船，满载着粮食、布匹、百货等，来来往往，把紧靠长沙市十五华里长的湘江岸边水面上，变成一片闹市。千百辆货车奔驰在沿江大道上。在长沙港依傍湘江的三十多个大小码头上和近旁的仓库内，都堆积着从农村运来的粮食和各种农产品，以及待运到农村去的布匹、百货等物资。原来固定在长沙港的三千多个码头工人，现在不够应付了。今年八月份由长沙港进出口的货物共十八万八千多吨，比七月份增加一倍多，比去年同期增加百分之四十一。
    入秋以来，湖南省从洞庭湖滨平原到南岭山脉，到处呈现一片丰收景象。全省继早稻丰收后，中稻又获丰收。农民们卖给国家的新谷，正一船船从各个湖汊河港向长沙港集中。八月份运到长沙港的粮食有十一万多吨，比丰收的一九五三年同期增加百分之十一。随着稻谷丰收，各地农民今年需要买进比往年更多的布匹、百货等生活用品。八月份，湖南省国营商业部门经长沙港运出适销农村的各色布匹、百货等用品，比去年同期增加了两、三倍。
