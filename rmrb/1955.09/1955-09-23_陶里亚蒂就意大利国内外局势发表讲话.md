Xinhua News Agency, Rome, September 20th (TASS dispatch) -- The working people of Genoa and delegations from all over Italy held a demonstration on the 18th to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of "l'Unità" (Unity). Italian Communist Party General Secretary Palmiro Togliatti spoke at a conference convened to celebrate the occasion.

　　Togliatti said that the profound changes that have taken place in the international situation in recent months prove the great achievements of the international peace movement and the merits of the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The policy "backed by strength" has encountered a crisis. Togliatti went on to say that Italy has not participated in the work of easing international tensions, and that the Christian Democratic government and the ruling group of this party have taken measures during this period that expose their intention to continue to pursue the Cold War policy. Togliatti said that we must view the government's actions in this way: the suppression measures taken against Christian Democratic members who participated in the Helsinki World Peace Conference, allowing the US military stationed in Austria to withdraw to Italy, refusing to establish normal diplomatic and commercial relations with China, and the parliament's failure to respond to the Soviet Supreme Soviet's proposal to exchange delegation visits.

　　Togliatti continued: In terms of domestic policy, certain social and political groups are opposed to easing tensions, and they are trying their best to maintain a policy of discrimination against certain citizens.

　　Togliatti said: In order to ease tensions, it is urgently necessary to re-observe the Italian Republican Constitution and develop the progressive factors contained therein: guaranteeing the freedom of all citizens; implementing social reforms in industry and agriculture; and defending the right to employment and the right of the working masses to participate in national management. In order to achieve these goals, a strong joint struggle by all healthy and constructive forces in the country is required.

    陶里亚蒂就意大利国内外局势发表讲话
    新华社二十一日讯　据塔斯社罗马二十日讯：热那亚劳动人民和来自意大利各地的代表团十八日举行示威，庆祝“团结报”创刊纪念日。意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在为庆祝这个日子而召集的一次大会上讲了话。
      陶里亚蒂说，最近几个月来国际局势方面发生的深刻变化证明了国际和平运动的巨大成就和苏联及各人民民主国家和平外交政策的功绩。“以实力为后盾”的政策已经遇到危机。陶里亚蒂接着说，意大利没有参加缓和国际紧张局势的工作，而且，天主教民主党政府和这个党的统治集团在这个时期还采取了一些暴露了他们意图继续执行冷战政策的措施。陶里亚蒂说，我们必须这样来看待政府的行动：对参加赫尔辛基世界和平大会的天主教民主党党员所采取的镇压措施，让驻奥地利美军撤到意大利，拒绝同中国建立正常的外交和商务关系，以及议会没有回答苏联最高苏维埃提出的互派代表团访问的建议。
    陶里亚蒂继续说：在国内政策方面，某些社会和政治集团反对缓和紧张关系，他们竭力企图继续保持对某些公民实行歧视的政策。
    陶里亚蒂说：为了缓和紧张关系，就亟须重新遵守意大利共和国宪法和发展其中所包含的进步因素：保证全体公民的自由；在工业和农业中实行社会改革；保卫就业权利和劳动群众参加国家管理工作的权利。为了达到这些目标，就需要国内一切健康的和建设性的力量开展强有力的联合斗争。
