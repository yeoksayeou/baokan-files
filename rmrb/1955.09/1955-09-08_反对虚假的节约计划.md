    Oppose False Economy Plans
    Yi Kun
    The Chongqing 507 Power Plant’s economy plan for the second half of the year, formulated in July, had three items: saving on coal, plant electricity consumption, and fixed expenses, totaling more than 124,000 yuan, of which coal accounted for more than 77,000 yuan. However, in this 77,000 yuan, more than 69,000 yuan was a reduction in transportation costs due to the railway bureau lowering coal freight rates. Therefore, although the overall economy plan exceeded the original target, more than half of the economy figures had nothing to do with the power plant's own efforts. Relevant authorities had raised concerns about this, pointing out that the plant still had potential in reducing losses during coal transportation and utilizing inferior coal, but the plant did not seriously explore this. When the 507 Plant revised its economy plan in early August, it still did not remove the 69,000 yuan reduction in coal freight rates from the plan.
    This false economy figure was actually approved by the Chongqing Electric Power Bureau; in fact, the electric power bureau had already included this figure in the economy target it had previously issued to the 507 Plant. Why was this done? The reason was that some leaders believed that such "savings" figures could both exceed the economy target and be completed with confidence; while exploring economy potential was too much effort. This behavior of taking the results of others' efforts as one's own economy achievements is very wrong. Such a plan can only cover up shortcomings in work, hinder the enthusiasm for exploring economy potential, and encourage blind complacency.
    The increase production and practice economy movement requires every enterprise to actively explore the enterprise's potential strength and conscientiously formulate and implement economy plans. Only in this way can we truly accumulate more funds for the country. The Chongqing 501 Power Plant also had some objective difficulties in saving coal and plant electricity consumption, but because it paid attention to exploring economy potential, organized technical personnel and veteran workers to conduct special research, improved equipment, and solved the problems of poor combustion and increased coal consumption, it created favorable conditions for using low-quality fine coal. The workers also proposed suggestions such as using old and waste materials in maintenance, improving construction, and making the savings in maintenance costs exceed the original plan by more than two times. As a result, when the economy plan was determined in early August, after reducing the false figures that originally accounted for more than a quarter of the economy target, the plan was still 59 percent higher than the original target. In a recent overhaul, the plant's labor and material costs were more than 30 percent lower than planned. These facts show that the potential of enterprises is great, and that practicing economy by tapping the internal potential of enterprises is not a "dangerous" thing.
    The examples of the two plants above illustrate two different attitudes towards formulating and implementing increase production and practice economy plans. We advocate the genuine economy of the 501 Power Plant and oppose the false economy of the 507 Power Plant.

    反对虚假的节约计划
    一坤
    重庆五零七电厂在七月间制定的下半年节约计划有三个项目：节约燃煤、厂用电和固定费用，共十二万四千多元，其中燃煤一项占七万七千多元。但在这七万七千多元中，却有六万九千多元是因铁路局降低煤炭运价而减少支出的运输费。因此，虽然总的节约计划超过了原来的指标，可是其中有一半以上的节约数字是同电厂本身努力毫不相干的。这一点，有关机关曾经提过意见，指出该厂在降低运煤的途中损耗和利用劣质煤等方面还有潜力，但该厂并没有认真去挖掘。八月初，五零七厂修订节约计划时，仍没有把煤炭运价降低的六万九千多元从计划里除掉。
    这个虚假的节约数字居然为重庆电业局所同意；甚至电业局早先颁发给五零七厂的节约指标中，就已把这个数字计算在内了。为什么要这样呢？原来是有些领导人员认为像这样的“节约”数字，既能使计划超过节约指标，完成起来又有把握；而挖掘节约潜力则太费力气了。这种把别人努力的结果拉来当成自己的节约成绩的行为是很不对的。这样的计划只能掩盖工作中的缺点，妨碍挖掘节约潜力的积极性，助长盲目自满情绪。
    增产节约运动要求每一个企业都必须从积极方面来挖掘企业潜在力量，认真制定和贯彻节约计划。只有这样，才能真正为国家积累更多的资金。重庆五零一电厂在燃煤和厂用电的节约上，也有一些客观困难，但是由于注意了发掘节约的潜力，组织技术人员、老工人专门研究，改进了设备，解决了燃烧不良、煤耗上升的问题，为用劣质末煤创造了有利条件。职工们还提出了在检修中利用旧料、废料，改进施工，使检修费的节约超过原计划两倍以上等建议。结果在八月上旬确定节约计划时，把原来占节约指标四分之一以上的虚假数字削减以后，计划仍比原来的指标高百分之五十九。该厂在最近的一项检修中，人工、材料费用比计划降低了百分之三十多。这些事实说明，企业的潜力是大的，从发掘企业内部的潜力来厉行节约，并不是什么“危险”的事。
    上面两个厂的例子，说明了制定和贯彻增产节约计划的两种不同态度。我们提倡五零一电厂的真正节约，反对五零七电厂的虚假节约。
