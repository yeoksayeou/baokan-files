Shandong Province Strengthens the Transformation of Backward Townships

Currently, about 10% of the townships in Shandong Province are still backward and have not been transformed. In order to adapt to the upcoming high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has recently paid attention to strengthening the work of transforming backward townships. They plan to basically eliminate backward townships throughout the province by the end of 1956. They have instructed local and county Party committees to conduct in-depth investigations of existing backward townships and formulate specific transformation plans before the end of September.

In the past, Shandong has achieved considerable success in transforming backward townships. The 188 backward villages transformed in the Wendeng Special District have all become first-class or second-class villages. This year, Jiaxiang County's Twelfth District transformed six backward townships. For example, in Houji Township, six of the original nine township government committee members were landlords, rich peasants, and reactionary officers, and the secretary of the CPC township branch was a rich peasant element who had infiltrated the Party. Out of the 25 landlord and rich peasant households in the township, 24 evaded the land reform and all infiltrated agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, continuing to oppress and exploit the peasants. After these landlords, despots, and counter-revolutionaries who had entrenched themselves above the people were purged from the Party, rural government, cooperatives, and teams, the land and farm tools of the escaped landlords and rich peasants were distributed to peasants who lacked land and farm tools in accordance with the law. The masses were very happy, and their enthusiasm for production increased even more. Three agricultural production cooperatives were reorganized, twelve mutual aid teams were developed, and a new credit cooperative was established. (Reported by our correspondent in Jinan)

    山东省加强对落后乡的改造
    山东省目前尚有百分之十左右的落后乡没有进行改造，中共山东省委为了适应即将来临的农业合作化高潮，最近注意加强了改造落后乡的工作。他们计划到一九五六年底，在全省范围内基本上消灭落后乡。已指示各地、县委对现有落后乡，要进行深入的调查，于九月底以前作出具体改造计划。
    山东过去在改造落后乡方面，已获得不少的成绩。文登专区改造的一百八十八个落后村，都已变成了一类村或二类村。嘉祥县十二区今年改造了六个落后乡，其中后集乡原来九个乡政府委员中，有六人是地主、富农和反动军官，中共乡支部书记是混进党内的富农分子。全乡共二十五户地主富农，有二十四户逃避了土地改革，而又全部混进了农业生产合作社和互助组，仍然欺压和剥削农民。当把这些盘据在人民头上的地主恶霸反革命分子从党内、乡村政权内和社、组内清除出去后，又把漏网地主富农的土地、农具依照法律分给少地缺农具的农民，群众非常高兴，生产劲头更大了。重新整顿了三处农业生产合作社，发展了十二个互助组，新建立了一处信用合作社。　（本报驻济南记者）
