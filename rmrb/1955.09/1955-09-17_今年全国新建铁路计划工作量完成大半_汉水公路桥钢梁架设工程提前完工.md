Xinhua News Agency, September 16th. By the end of August, more than half of this year's planned workload for new railway construction nationwide had been completed. There are currently fourteen new railways under construction, and six hundred and eighty kilometers of track have already been laid on the ten railways that are currently being laid.

The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway had been laid to a point 526 kilometers away from Lanzhou by September 7th, leaving only 12 kilometers to Zhangye. The roadbed, bridges, and culverts leading to Zhangye have been basically completed, and it is expected that the original annual track-laying plan can be completed ahead of schedule soon.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is being constructed simultaneously in three sections: north, central, and south. The northern section has been laid to Yangjiawan, and this year's track-laying task has been completed. In the northern section, only about one hundred meters of the pilot tunnel of the largest Qinling Tunnel remains to be excavated. On September 7th, the southern section had been laid to Miehuogou, 403 kilometers away from Chengdu, leaving 51 kilometers to Lueyang. The tunnel, bridge, and roadbed projects in the central section have been fully launched.

The Lanzhou-Xinjiang, Baoji-Chengdu, Jining-Erenhot, Fengtai-Shacheng, and Litang-Zhanjiang Railways, which are continuing to be built this year, are all major railway lines stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. According to the original state plan, more than 1,050 kilometers of new railways will be laid this year. Adding the more than 1,400 kilometers that have already been laid in 1953 and 1954, only more than 1,000 kilometers of tasks remain for the last two years of the first Five-Year Plan. The first Five-Year Plan stipulates that an average of 817 kilometers of new railways should be built each year, which is two to three times faster than before liberation. From the start of the construction of the Songhu Railway in 1874 to 1949, China built an average of only 286 kilometers of railways per year in seventy-six years. Moreover, the railways built before liberation were mostly in coastal and plain areas, while the new railways being built now are mostly in remote mountainous areas in the northwest and southwest, making the technical and construction conditions much more difficult and complex than before.

(By our correspondent in Wuhan, 16th) The steel girder erection project of the Hanshui Highway Bridge, one of the components of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, has been completed ahead of schedule. The steel girder type of the Hanshui Highway Bridge is a "plate girder arch truss hybrid structure beam." The length of the steel girder is nearly 200 meters, and the width is more than 25 meters. The engineering technicians and workers who built the bridge were erecting bridges of this structure for the first time.

The erection of the steel girders began on July 15 and ended completely on September 15. These two months were a particularly hot period in the Wuhan area, and the bridge construction workers had to wear work clothes and thick canvas gloves to persist in operating on the hot steel girders. In order to devote themselves to the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge as soon as possible and to welcome the upcoming National Day, the employees who built the Hanshui Highway Bridge launched a labor emulation drive from the beginning of September, which enabled the steel girder erection project to be completed three and a half days ahead of schedule.

The erection of the steel girders was carried out with the direct assistance of Soviet experts. During the tense "closure" project of the steel girders, Soviet experts insisted on working at the site for more than 20 hours. With the help of the experts, the workers erecting the steel girders have skillfully mastered the technology of erecting this type of steel girder.

Now, the Hanshui Highway Bridge project has entered the stage of intense riveting operations.

    今年全国新建铁路计划工作量完成大半
    汉水公路桥钢梁架设工程提前完工
    新华社十六日讯到八月底，今年全国新建铁路计划工作量已完成大半。现在正在施工的新铁路有十四条，其中正在进行铺轨的十条铁路已经铺好了六百八十多公里。
    兰新铁路在九月七日已铺轨到距离兰州的五百二十六公里处，距张掖只剩十二公里了。通往张掖的路基、桥涵等工程都已基本完成，预计最近就可以提前完成原定的全年铺轨计划。
    宝成铁路正由南、中、北三段分头施工。北段已铺轨到杨家湾，今年的铺轨任务已经完成。北段正在施工的隧道中最大的秦岭隧道的导洞，只剩下一百多公尺还没有打通。南段在九月七日已铺轨到距离成都四百零三公里的灭火沟，距略阳还有五十一公里。中段的隧道、桥梁、路基工程已全面展开。
    今年继续修建的兰新、宝成、集二、丰沙、黎湛等铁路都是五年计划中所规定新建的主要铁路干线。按国家原定计划，今年要铺一千零五十多公里新铁路，加上一九五三年和一九五四年已经铺好的一千四百多公里，第一个五年计划的后二年只剩下一千多公里的任务了。第一个五年计划规定，平均每年要修八百一十七公里的新铁路，这样的建设速度比解放前要快两三倍。中国从一八七四年修建淞沪铁路开始，到一九四九年的七十六年中，平均每年不过修筑二百八十六公里铁路。而且解放以前修筑的铁路大都在沿海和平原地区，现在修建的新铁路大都在西北、西南等偏僻山区，在技术和施工条件上都比以往困难复杂得多。
    本报武汉十六日电  武汉长江大桥组成部分之一的汉水公路桥的钢梁架设工程，已经提前全部完工。汉水公路桥的钢梁型式是“钣梁拱桁混合结构梁”。钢梁的长度近二百公尺，宽达二十五公尺多。修桥的工程技术人员和工人们，都是第一次架设这样结构的桥梁。
    钢梁的架设工程开始于七月十五日，到九月十五日全部结束。这两个月正是武汉地区特别炎热的时期，修桥的工人要穿着工作服和戴着厚帆布的手套，在烫手的钢梁上坚持操作。修建汉水公路桥的职工为了早日投入到长江大桥的建设工程中去，和迎接即将到来的国庆节，从九月初展开了劳动竞赛，使架设钢梁的工程提前三天半完成。
    钢梁的架设工程是在苏联专家直接帮助下进行的。在紧张的钢梁“合龙”工程中，苏联专家在现场坚持了二十多个小时的工作。在专家的帮助下，架设钢梁的工人们已经熟练地掌握了架设这种钢梁的技术。
    现在，汉水公路桥工程已经进入紧张的拼铆作业阶段。
