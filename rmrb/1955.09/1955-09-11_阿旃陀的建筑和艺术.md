    The Architecture and Art of Ajanta
    Indian Archaeologist Chakravarti
    Like all the world's great historical sites—such as China's great Dunhuang, Datong Yungang, and Longmen—the art of Ajanta does not belong solely to its country of origin, but to the entire world. This artistic exemplar represents the accumulated labor and ideology of civilized nations throughout history, and hopes that every imaginative person will come to appreciate them.
    As far as India is concerned, as early as the second century B.C., stone-carved architecture had reached a very high level. The earliest and finest examples of this architecture can be found in Western India and the Deccan Plateau. They belong to the two major sects of Buddhism, namely Hinayana or the Lesser Vehicle, and Mahayana or the Greater Vehicle. The excavation of Hinayana grottoes dates from the second century B.C. to the second century A.D.; after this period, there were approximately three hundred years of obscurity. This was followed by the commencement of Mahayana activities, which continued for several centuries. The most perfect of these grottoes are found in Bajja, Kondane, Bhaja, Nasik, Karle, and Kanheri in Western India, and Pitalkhora, Ajanta, Aurangabad, and Ellora in the Hyderabad province of the Deccan Plateau. Without going into detail about the origins of this type of architecture, we can say that it occupies a prominent position in the development of Indian plastic arts. This grotto architecture can be divided into two main categories: the first is the "Chaitya" cave, or Buddhist hall, where people gather and worship, and the second is the monastic residence for monks. The "Chaitya" caves are more important and have more elaborate architectural decorations. They generally have two rows of columns and a semi-circular space, and are built with stone-carved "stupas," or mound-shaped pagodas, which contain the relics of the Buddha. The cave roofs have scroll decorations, one or more, symbolizing the Buddha's position as the cosmic master in the spiritual world. The most refined and captivating part of this architectural design is its facade, which has a lintel above the cave door and an arched window above it, allowing sunlight to enter the Buddhist hall. The largest of these Buddhist halls is in Bajja, and the most magnificent is in Karle. In the early grottoes, many designs show that this architecture evolved from wooden structures, and wooden rafters have indeed been found in the ceilings and archways of some grottoes. However, a characteristic of the later stage of stone-carved architecture during the Mahayana period is that it no longer imitated wooden structures, but instead carved Buddha statues. In the early relics, only symbols related to the Buddha, such as the throne, the Bodhi tree under which Shakyamuni attained enlightenment, his footprints, and other signs, represented the Buddha, and Buddha statues were often absent.
    The Ajanta Caves are named after a village about seven miles away. The caves are located in a remote valley with a poetic atmosphere. The twenty-nine caves are carved into the cliffs of a crescent-shaped mountain peak about two hundred and fifty feet high, with a small stream flowing below. The area is lush with shrubs, and during the rainy season, flowers bloom, creating a spectacular scene. The origins of these caves can be attributed to the Buddhist followers of the Hinayana and Mahayana sects. The earliest caves belong to the Hinayana practitioners, consisting of two Buddhist halls and three monastic residences, dating from the second century B.C. to the second century A.D. The remaining twenty-four caves, including two Buddhist halls and twenty-two monastic residences, were carved by Mahayana practitioners between the fifth and seventh centuries. Although the Ajanta Caves are famous for their murals, they also contain a large number of statues, mainly of Shakyamuni Buddha and bodhisattvas, some of which are of extremely high artistic value. Originally, most of the walls and ceilings of the caves were painted with murals, but only six caves have preserved these murals to this day. When these murals were first discovered one hundred and thirty-five years ago, they were severely damaged by vandals, causing the world to lose a collection of precious cultural relics. The earliest works of these murals can be traced back to the second century B.C., and are now only found in Caves 9 and 10, and have been badly damaged. The murals in Caves 16 and 17 were created in the fifth century, when Indian art reached its peak. The murals in Caves 1 and 2 are the most well-preserved, and their creation time would not be too far from this era.
    Like ancient murals elsewhere in the world, the painters of Ajanta also used the simplest methods to create their works. They brushed a layer of mud mixed with cow dung and rice husks onto the porous rock surface. After this treatment, they applied a layer of lime, then sketched on it, and finally colored it. The pigments were made from locally sourced minerals and plants, usually including red and yellow ochre, chalk, lampblack, and indigo. Only the blue used in the later murals was made from imported lapis lazuli powder. The painting methods often demonstrate the painters' superb skills and rich imagination; although chiaroscuro rendering and modeling techniques were already mastered, they were not widely used. In these paintings, especially on the ceilings of Caves 1 and 2, are painted various decorative paintings, including patterns, garlands, lotus patterns, square and rectangular grids, various flowers and trees, common animals, legendary animals, half-human half-beast creatures, and mythological figures. There are also scenes from life, some depicting foreign women in their national costumes, exotic figures, and animals. There are also highly artistic portraits, not only of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, but also of secular figures. The Padmapani Bodhisattva in Cave 1 has been praised as the pinnacle of Asian painting art, and some of the works are very similar to Michelangelo's paintings. In addition, there are depictions of Jataka tales, which are stories of the Buddha's previous lives, in his various incarnations, sometimes as a compassionate bodhisattva, sometimes as a human, sometimes as an animal, to save sentient beings from suffering. Cave 17 preserves the most narrative paintings, depicting the most moving events in the life of the Buddha. These murals also contain historical paintings. In Cave 1, there is a court painting depicting an Indian king receiving foreign guests from friendly countries with considerable ceremony. Some have identified this painting as depicting Pulakeshin II, the ruler of the Chalukya dynasty, receiving envoys and attendants sent by the Persian King Khosrau II. The famous Persian historian Tabari recorded this event. There are many paintings of a high standard, and it is impossible to introduce them all here. Therefore, I can only talk about a few of them. In Cave 1, there is a painting of "The Dying Princess," whose expression of grief and sorrow is unparalleled in the history of art. Also in Cave 1, the "Black Princess" and in Cave 2, the "Birth of the Buddha," those scenes depicting the palace, dressing, and the Buddha's visit to his family are all exquisite masterpieces, whose beauty and artistic value are incomparable. In addition to their artistic value, these murals provide unique materials for the study of ethnology, social life, the clothing and decorations of men and women of all walks of life at the time, hairstyles, and so on. The way of narrating stories is also easy for everyone to understand. Those rich and colorful decorations, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, garlands, are depicted very skillfully and set off the various parts of the body very cleverly. The folds of the outer garments are painted very simply, but very accurately. These murals show that the Ajanta painters were already adept at wielding their brushes and were good at using colors. The most outstanding artistic achievements of those master painters are also reflected in the women they painted. Someone commented on the female figures in the Ajanta murals: "The Ajanta murals' straightforward, heroic admiration for women is truly unparalleled... They are not just women, but the embodiment of all beauty in the world. Despite being so joyful and charming, they never lose their dignity and are not subjected to any contempt or insult."
    Unfortunately, we know nothing about who those artists were or where they came from. The art of telling stories through carving and painting has been perfected in Buddhist monuments, but the names of even one of the simple artisans who participated in the work have not been recorded to this day. However, some of them must have been remarkable figures in the art world at the time, and because they engaged in creation and left behind works for future generations to observe and appreciate, they are still remembered today. Some of the murals in Ajanta were undoubtedly created by artists of little renown, and a few may have been done by monks. However, some works show a high degree of skill and imagination, and we can be sure that they are the genius creations of meritorious artists.
    Finally, I cannot fully express my congratulations on the World Peace Council's suggestion to hold an exhibition of Ajanta murals. The importance of these murals in the international art world is undeniable. The Buddha himself lived for peace and died for peace; the Ajanta murals symbolize what he was striving for at the time and what peace-loving countries around the world are striving for today. In these murals, there is no hint of aggression. Many scenes show love for all living beings, and through love for humanity, greed and evil are overcome. Therefore, I would like to end by quoting a saying from our ancient sages: "Peace, peace, may peace prevail forever!"

    阿旃陀的建筑和艺术
    印度考古学家　查克拉瓦蒂
    如同世界上一切伟大的遗迹——好比伟大中国的敦煌、大同云岗和龙门一样，阿旃陀的艺术也不是只属于它的本国，而是属于全世界的。这种艺术典范代表着文明国家历代所积累的劳动成果和思想意识，盼望每一个富有想像力的人都来欣赏它们。
    就印度来说，早在纪元前二世纪，凿石而成的建筑就达到了很高的水准。这种建筑在西印度和德干高原可以找到最早的和最优秀的范例。它们属于佛教的两大宗派，即希那衍或小乘和摩诃衍或大乘。小乘石窟的开凿是从纪元前二世纪起至第二世纪；过了这一时期，大约有三百年是默默无闻的。其后即是大乘活动的开始，并持续了数百年。这些石窟，最完美的发现于西印度的巴贾、康丹、拜萨、那西克、卡尔勒和康希里以及德干高原海德拉巴省的皮塔考拉、阿旃陀、奥兰格巴德以及爱罗拉等地。关于这种建筑物的源流，姑且不详细谈，但我们可以说，它在印度造型艺术的发展中是占有显著地位的。这种石窟建筑可以分为两大类：第一类是在那里聚会和礼佛的“支提”窟，即佛殿，第二类是僧侣起居的寮房。“支提”窟比较重要，建筑上的装饰也比较讲究。它们一般有两下列柱和半圆形空间，建有石雕的“窣堵坡”，或称丘状佛塔，里面藏着佛陀的舍利。窟顶有卷式装饰，一个或数个不等，象征着佛在精神世界里的宇宙主宰的地位。这种建筑设计最精和引人入胜的地方是它的正面，这正面，下有窟门的楣框，上有拱窗，可使阳光照入佛殿。这种佛殿，以巴贾的为最大，以卡尔勒的为最壮丽。在早期的石窟中，有许多设计表明了这种建筑是脱胎于木构建筑的，有些石窟的顶部和大门拱顶确实发现过木椽。可是在大乘时期石凿建筑的后一阶段有一特征，就是不再模仿木构建筑，而雕凿佛像了。在早期的遗迹中，代表佛陀的，只有一些同他有关的象征，如宝座、释迦在它下面成道的菩提树、他的脚印和其他标志，而佛像则往往是没有的。
    阿旃陀石窟得名于距此约七英里的一个村镇，石窟坐落于荒僻的幽谷，环境气氛极富诗意。石窟共二十九个，凿于高约二百五十英尺的新月形山峰的悬崖峭壁间，其下有小溪流过。那里灌木繁茂，到了雨季，百花盛开，景色壮观。这些石窟的起源要归功于小乘和大乘两大宗派的佛教信徒。最早的石窟属于小乘教徒，计有两个佛殿和三个寮房，时期起于纪元前二世纪，迄于第二世纪。其余二十四个石窟，内有两个佛殿和二十二个寮房，都是大乘教徒从第五世纪到第七世纪之间凿造的。阿旃陀的石窟虽然都因壁画著名，它们还有着大批的雕像，主要是释迦牟尼佛和众菩萨，其中有些有极高的艺术价值。本来大多数的石窟壁上和顶上都绘了图画，可是这种图画保存至今的只有六个石窟了。一百三十五年前，当这些壁画初次被发现的时候，它们遭到了破坏分子的严重毁坏，使世界上损失了一批珍贵的文物。这些壁画最早的作品可以追溯到纪元前二世纪，现在仅见于第九号、第十号两窟，而且已被搞得一塌糊涂了。第十六号和第十七号两窟的壁画，乃是第五世纪当印度艺术登峰造极的时候创作的。第一号和第二号石窟的壁画保存得最完整，其创作时间也不会离这个年代太远。
    正如世界上其他各地的古代壁画一样，阿旃陀的画家也是采用了最简单的方法来创作的。他们在多孔的岩石表面上，刷上一层混和着牛粪和砻糠的泥土。这样处理过后，再敷上一层石灰，然后在上面钩绘草图，最后进行着色。颜料是用就地取材的矿物和植物配制的，通常计有红色和黄色的赭石、白垩、油烟和靛青。只是后期壁画所用的蓝色才用外地输入的石蓝粉调成。作画的方法常常显示了画家们高明的技巧和丰富的想像；明暗渲染和造型技术虽早已掌握了，但并没有被普遍采用。在这些绘画中，特别是第一号石窟和第二号石窟的藻井上面，绘着各种装饰画，其中有花纹，有花圈，有荷花模样，有正方和长方的各种图案的木格，有形形色色的花卉和树木，有常见的走兽，传说中的动物，半人半兽和神话人物。另有写生的场面，有的描写穿着自己民族服装的外国仕女、富有异国情调的人物和走兽。这里还有艺术造诣极高的画像，不仅有佛像和菩萨，也有世俗的人物。第一号石窟内的波头摩巴尼菩萨曾被誉为亚洲绘画艺术的极顶，其中有些作品同弥盖朗哲罗的绘画非常相像。此外还有描写本生经故事就是释迦佛前生的故事的，在他的各个不同前生中，本是慈悲的菩萨，有时为人，有时化兽，以拯救众生的苦难。第十七号石窟所保存的叙事画最多，内容是描写佛陀生平中最动人的事迹。这些壁画中也不乏历史画。在第一号石窟有一幅宫廷画，描写印度王以相当隆重的仪式接待来自友邦的外宾。有人鉴定这幅画是描写查鲁克耶朝统治者普拉皑新二世接待波斯王拘尸卢二世派来的使节和随员的场面。波斯著名史学家泰巴利对这件事有过一段记载。具有高度水平的绘画，数量很多，在这里不可能一一介绍。因此我只能谈一谈其中的几幅作品。在第一号石窟内，有一幅“公主临终”，所表现的凄恻伤感的神情，在艺术史上无出其右。同是第一号石窟内那幅“黑公主”和第二号石窟内那幅“佛陀诞生图”，那些描写宫闱、梳妆以及佛陀访问家属的画面都是精心杰作，其美感和艺术价值是无可比拟的。这些壁画除了艺术价值外，对于研究人种学、社会生活、当时各界男女的衣服装饰、头发式样等等，提供了独特的资料，叙述故事的方式，也是人人看得懂的。那些丰富多采的装饰品，项圈、手镯、耳环、花环，都描绘得非常高明，并且给身体各部分衬托得很巧妙。外衣的褶纹画得很简朴，却极精确。这些壁画表现了阿旃陀的画家们挥笔时已经得心应手，并且善于运用色调。那些绘画大师最卓越的艺术成就还表现在他们所绘的仕女身上。有人在提到阿旃陀壁画的女子形象时曾评论道：“阿旃陀壁画这样率直的、豪侠般的崇尚妇女，真是无可比拟的了。……她们不仅仅是女子，而是世界上一切美的化身。尽管是那样的欢乐和妩媚，但从未丧失她们的尊严，没有受到任何轻视或凌辱。”
    遗憾得很，那些艺术家究竟是谁，他们来自何方，我们一点也不知道。通过雕刻和绘画来谈讲故事的这一艺术，在佛教的纪念物中，已经尽善尽美，可是那些参加工作的淳朴的匠人的大名至今一个也没有记下来。不过他们当中有些人在当时艺术界一定是了不起的人物，由于他们从事了创作，留下了作品给后代来观摩欣赏，到今天还受到人们的怀念。阿旃陀的若干壁画，无疑是名望不大的艺术家所创作的，也有少数可能出自僧侣之手。但是，有些作品表现了高度的技巧和想像力，我们可以肯定它们是功勋艺术家的天才创作。
    最后，对于世界和平理事会建议举办阿旃陀壁画展览，我无法充分地表达我的祝贺。这些壁画在国际艺术界中的重要性是无可置辩的。佛陀自己为和平而生，为和平而死；阿旃陀壁画象征着他当时所争取的是什么，今天全世界爱好和平的国家正在争取的是什么。在这些壁画中，没有任何暗示侵略的地方。很多画面表明了对众生的爱，并通过对人类的爱战胜了贪欲和邪恶。因此，我要引用我们古代圣贤的一句话作为结束：“和平，和平，和平永存！”
