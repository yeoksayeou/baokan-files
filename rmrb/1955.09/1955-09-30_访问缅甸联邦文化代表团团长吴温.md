    A Visit with U Win, Head of the Cultural Delegation from the Union of Burma
    Our Reporter
    U Win, Head of the Cultural Delegation from the Union of Burma and Minister of Culture of the Union of Burma, led seventy Burmese musicians, dancers, and delegation staff to our country for a performance tour. This is an envoy of culture and friendship, bringing forty excellent, nationally-flavored artistic programs from Burma. It brings songs, dances, and the friendship of the Burmese people.

    In a bright reception room, U Win received the reporter. He first spoke about cultural and artistic exchanges between China and Burma. While introducing U Kyaw Tun, the cultural secretary of the delegation, who was present, he said to me, "Before you arrived, we were discussing events from over a thousand years ago. At that time, the Pyu kingdom within Burma sent a grand cultural mission to China to perform."

    U Win's words reminded me of our ancient historical records. Around the beginning of the ninth century, thirty-five "musicians" came from the hot lands of our southwestern neighbor, bringing twenty-two kinds of musical instruments and twelve moving melodies. These ancient Burmese musicians performed so brilliantly that our famous poets of the time recorded the Chinese people's heartfelt admiration for the art of our Burmese friends in their poems. The Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi vividly recorded those beautiful songs and dances and music with expressive verses. The poet wrote:

    “One blow on the jade conch pushes the hair high,
    One strike on the bronze drum makes the tattooed body leap,
    Pearl tassels whirl like twinkling stars,
    Floral garlands sway like writhing dragons and snakes.”

    These verses reflect our people's yearning for the ancient art of our neighbors. Now, we have the opportunity to appreciate this wonderful song and dance again.

    U Win continued, "Cultural and artistic exchanges between China and Burma have existed for many centuries, but this vivid interaction between the peoples of the two countries was interrupted during the British colonial rule over Burma. However, after Burma gained independence and China was liberated, we resumed and developed this connection. Three years ago, my predecessor, U Tun Pe, led a cultural delegation to China; and Mr. Zheng Zhenduo led the Chinese cultural delegation to Burma as guests at the beginning of this year." He said with a smile, "Our Burmese people are proud to welcome Chinese cultural envoys with enthusiasm." "Now, we have come to your country again," U Win continued, "This time, we made a special effort to arrive in Beijing before October 1st, because we want to come here and celebrate your National Day with you."

    Then, U Win briefly introduced the delegation he led to the reporter. The delegation includes Burma's most outstanding artists. Like the delegation's artistic director, the master of the harp, U Ba Than, whom the head of the delegation calls "a strange, genius person." He can play various instruments, and even if he has never played an instrument before, he will learn it after a few tries. U Han Pa, the best Burmese ensemble drummer and captain of the Burmese National Orchestra, is already sixty-eight years old, but he is still so energetic. Maung Khin, Burma's most famous folk singer, often sings songs of village girls on the radio, singing out the hearts of village girls. The delegation also includes U Aung Min, Burma's most popular classical dancer, and the famous composer U Po Wei... They are all talented artists, loved by the Burmese people.

    However, U Win introduced that the members of the delegation not only include these established artists, but also dancing talents from the farmers. U La Nyo came straight from the fields. With an elephant foot drum hung around his neck, he beats the leather drum and dances barefoot, showing distinct national characteristics and the spirit of the people. There are also eight young girls from the Burmese National School of Music and Drama, who are all future artists. The youngest little dancer in the delegation is only fourteen years old.

    Burmese actors and artists often like to use many very beautiful stage names to call themselves. Some are called "Emerald," and some are called "Sparkling Diamond." People may not know their real names, but they are familiar with their stage names. Now these precious "gems" and "diamonds" of the Burmese people have come to China, and they will also leave fond memories in the hearts of the Chinese people.

    U Win also introduced the diverse Burmese national musical instruments brought by the delegation. The delegation has an orchestra. This orchestra is a strange and wonderful combination of sounds. There is a drum set composed of twenty-two drums, a gong set composed of twenty-two gongs, large and small suonas, cymbals, flutes and other bamboo instruments... The delegation brought a short drum team - the "Do Pa Team." Short drums are popular on the shores of the "Sea of Victory" near the ancient capital of Mandalay. The delegation also brought a harp, which is the most beloved instrument of the Burmese people. There is also a zither, which is a unique Burmese ancient zither. In the caves of Bagan, the oldest ancient capital of Burma, there are "Ajanta" murals, and the girls in the paintings are playing boat-shaped zithers.

    U Win also introduced the delegation's colorful artistic programs. The "Giant Drum Dance" has been around for more than five hundred years, and the "Long Drum Dance" has also been around for more than three hundred years. Among Burmese national songs and dances, there is the majestic Burmese "Horse Dance," and the graceful and gentle Mon double dance. There is a dance drama of the Buddhist epic Ramayana, in which there is a Monkey King, which U Win said is very similar to Sun Wukong in Chinese Peking Opera. This dance drama needs to be performed for forty nights in Burma to be completed, and Burmese artists will come to introduce the essence of it to Chinese audiences this time. The delegation also brought three famous songs by the Burmese composer Swe Pay Aye.

    U Win said, "During the British colonial rule, the colonizers did not encourage the development of Burmese national art, but the people loved their national art, and they preserved the tradition of national culture."

    U Win concluded his introduction by saying, "In short, our main purpose in coming to China is for the friendship between the two peoples." He said, "We have brought songs of friendship from Burma, and we want to sing friendship with the Chinese people. Our songs include odes to Chairman Mao Zedong, and songs of congratulations from the Burmese people to the Chinese people. At the same time, because our era urgently needs peace, the delegation will also sing songs calling for peace and opposing war."

    Here is a song of friendship from the people of the Irrawaddy River:

    “The Burmese people extend Mita (cordial greetings) to the Chinese people,
    May their republic be victorious and prosperous,
    May the people of China and Burma work together
    For the peace of the whole world.”

    Before leaving, U Win expressed his appreciation for the culture and art of New China. He said that he was very interested in Chinese art programs such as the Lotus Dance, the Tea Picking Butterfly Dance, and Peking Opera. He said: "The Chinese cultural delegation's visit and performance left an unforgettable impression on the hearts of the Burmese people. Although the delegation has been gone for a long time, people are still talking about them!" He told me that during the Chinese cultural delegation's visit to Burma, Burmese artists had learned Chinese dances; Chinese artists also learned Burmese songs and dances. U Win said: "This time, the artists of the two countries are together again. I believe that in this month and a half, we will have more and better opportunities to learn from each other."

    访问缅甸联邦文化代表团团长吴温
    本报记者
    缅甸联邦文化代表团团长、缅甸联邦文化部部长吴温率领了七十位缅甸音乐和舞蹈艺术家及代表团的工作人员来到我国进行访问演出。这是一个文化和友谊的使节，它带来了缅甸四十个富有民族特色的优秀艺术节目。它带来了歌，带来了舞，也带来了缅甸人民的友情。
    在一间明亮的客室里，吴温接见了记者。他首先谈到了中缅两国的文化和艺术交流。他一面给记者介绍在座的代表团文化秘书吴觉吞，一面向我说：“在你来到以前，我们正谈论着一千多年以前的事情。那个时候，缅甸境内的骠国曾派遣了一个盛大的文化使团到中国来演出过。”
    吴温团长的话使我记起了我国古老的历史记载。大约是在九世纪开端，从我国的西南邻邦的炎热的土地上来了三十五位“乐工”，他们带来了二十二种乐器和十二支动人心弦的乐曲。这些古代的缅甸音乐家表演得那样出色，使我们当时的著名诗人在他的诗篇里记载了中国人民对缅甸友邦的艺术的衷心赞美。唐代诗人白居易用传神的诗句生动地记录了那些优美的歌舞和音乐。诗人写道：
    “玉螺一吹推髻耸，
    铜鼓一击文身踊，
    珠缨炫转星宿摇，
    花鬘斗薮龙蛇动。”
    这些诗句反映了我国人民对于我们邻国的古老艺术的向往。现在，我们又有机会欣赏到这美妙的歌舞了。
    吴温团长接着说：“中缅两国的文化和艺术交流多少世纪以来就曾存在着，只是在英国对缅甸实行殖民统治时期，两国人民的这种生动的交往才被隔断了。但是当缅甸获得了独立，中国获得了解放之后，我们又恢复并且发展了这种联系。三年前，我的前驱者吴吞帕曾率领文化代表团到过中国；而郑振铎先生率领的中国文化代表团于今年初还在缅甸作客呢。”他微笑着说：“我们缅甸人民是以对中国文化使者的热情欢迎而引为骄傲的。”“现在，我们又来到你们的国家了，”吴温团长继续说，“这次我们特地赶在十月一日前来到北京，因为我们要到这里来和你们共祝你们的国庆。”
    接着吴温团长扼要地向记者介绍了他所率领的代表团。代表团里有着缅甸的最杰出的艺术家。像代表团的艺术指导、弯琴名手吴巴丹，团长称之为“奇异的、天才的人”。他能玩弄各种乐器，有的乐器，即使他没玩过，只要学几次就会了。缅甸最好的套鼓敲击能手、缅甸国家管弦乐队队长吴汉帕，他已经有六十八岁的高龄了，但是他现在还是那样的精神。缅甸最著名的民歌手马庆，她经常在电台里演唱村女的歌，唱出村女的心。代表团里还有缅甸最受欢迎的古典舞蹈家吴昂明，还有著名的作曲家吴坡韦……，他们都是有天才的艺术家，受到缅甸人民的喜爱。
    但是，吴温团长介绍说，代表团的成员不仅有这些成名的艺术家，而且还有农民中的舞蹈能手。吴拉纽就是打从田野上来的。他身上挂起一只象脚鼓，手击皮鼓，赤脚起舞，表现出显明的民族特性和人民性。还有八个缅甸国家音乐戏剧学校的年轻的女孩子，她们都是未来的艺术家。代表团里最年轻的一个小舞蹈家才十四岁。
    缅甸的演员、艺术家常常喜欢用许多非常美丽的艺名来称呼自己。他们有的叫做“绿宝石”，有的叫做“闪光的金钢钻”。人民不一定知道他们的真名，但都熟悉他们的艺名。现在这些缅甸人民珍贵的“宝石”、“钻石”到中国来了，他们也将会在中国人民的心中留下亲切的记忆。
    吴温团长还介绍了代表团带来的缅甸多种多样的民族乐器。代表团有一个乐队。这个乐队是奇异的、美妙的音响的组合。有二十二个鼓组成的套鼓，有二十二个锣组成的套锣，有大小唢呐，铜钹、笛子和其他竹乐器……。代表团带来一个短鼓队——“都巴队”。短鼓风行在古都曼德勒附近的“胜利之海”的湖滨。代表团还带来箧琴，这是缅甸人民最心爱的乐器。还有弯琴，这是缅甸所独有的古琴。在缅甸最老的古都蒲甘的石窟里遗留着“阿旃陀”壁画，画里的少女就弹着舟形的弯琴。
    吴温团长也介绍了代表团多采的艺术节目。“巨鼓舞”已有五百多年历史了，“长鼓舞”也已流传了三百多年。在缅甸的民族歌舞中有威武的缅甸族的“马舞”，有优美柔和的汶族双人舞。有一出佛教史诗拉马耶那舞剧，其中有一个猴王，吴温团长说，它很像中国京剧中的孙悟空。这个舞剧在缅甸要连演四十个晚上才能演完，缅甸的艺术家这次将来向中国观众介绍其中的精华。代表团还带来了缅甸的一位大作曲家瑞卑埃的三支名歌。
    吴温团长说，“在英国殖民统治期间，殖民者是不鼓励缅甸民族艺术的发展的，但是人民喜爱自己的民族艺术，他们保存了民族文化的传统。”
    吴温团长归结他的介绍说：“总之，我们来到中国，主要目的就是为了两国人民之间的友谊。”他说：“我们从缅甸带来了友谊的歌声，我们要和中国人民一道歌唱友谊。我们的歌曲中有对毛泽东主席的颂歌，有着缅甸人民向中国人民的祝贺之歌。同时，因为我们这个时代特别迫切地需要和平，代表团也将唱出要求和平、反对战争的歌声。”
    这里就是伊洛瓦底江人民的友谊之歌：
    “缅甸人民向中国人民致以米塔（亲切的问候），
    愿他们的共和国胜利繁荣，
    愿中缅两国人民协力同心
    为了全世界的和平”。
    临别，吴温团长对新中国的文化艺术表示赞赏。他说，他对于荷花舞、采茶扑蝶舞以及京剧等等的中国艺术节目感到很大的兴趣。他说：“中国文化代表团的访问演出在缅甸人民心中留下了难忘的印象。虽然代表团已经离开很久了，但是人民至今还在谈论着他们哩！”他告诉我，在中国文化代表团访缅期间，缅甸的艺术家已经学习了中国的舞蹈；中国的艺术家们也学习了缅甸的歌舞。吴温团长说：“这一次，两国的艺术家们又在一起了。我相信在这一个半月内，我们将能有相互学习的更多更好的机会。”
