Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 16th (TASS): Egyptian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Muhammad Abu Naseer, held a press conference on the 14th for foreign journalists. At the conference, he stated that the Egyptian government is adopting a new approach to foreign trade. According to him, the new approach is: "Egypt will expand trade with countries willing to purchase Egyptian cotton, and on the other hand, Egypt will reduce trade with countries unwilling to purchase Egyptian cotton."

Naseer then pointed out that Egypt is expanding trade cooperation with other countries based on the recommendations of the Bandung Asian-African Conference. He specifically noted the development of trade ties between Egypt and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various People's Democratic countries. Naseer said, "The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and Eastern European countries are now the best customers for Egyptian goods." Naseer continued, saying that Egypt intends to develop its own industry in order to be able to export manufactured goods. According to Naseer, the first steel plant in Egypt will be completed in another year and a half.

In response to questions from reporters, Naseer pointed out that Egypt's foreign trade is currently developing smoothly, and "expanding trade ties with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various People's Democratic countries has greatly contributed to this development."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 17th: Egyptian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Muhammad Abu Naseer, announced on the 15th that the Egyptian government has established a new company to expand trade with Asian and African countries, including the People's Republic of China.

Naseer said that the purpose of this company is to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference regarding the need for closer economic relations between the peoples of Eastern countries. It will seek to conclude barter agreements to balance Egypt's foreign trade payments.

Naseer also announced that the Egyptian Cabinet has approved the recently concluded trade agreement with China. He pointed out that Egypt has a trade surplus with China, while it has a large trade deficit with Western countries. He said, "We consider China to be Egypt's best customer."

    新华社十六日讯  塔斯社开罗十五日讯：埃及工商部长穆·阿·努赛尔在十四日举行记者招待会，招待外国记者。他在招待会上说，埃及政府在对外贸易方面采取了新的方针。据他说，新的方针是：“埃及将扩大同那些准备购买埃及棉花的国家的贸易，另一方面，埃及将缩小同那些不愿意购买埃及棉花的国家的贸易”。
    努赛尔接着指出，埃及根据万隆亚非会议的建议，正在扩大同其他国家的贸易合作。他特别指出，埃及同苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的贸易联系有了发展。努赛尔说，“苏联、中华人民共和国和东欧各国现在是埃及商品最好的主顾”。努赛尔接着说，埃及打算发展自己的工业以便有可能输出制成品。据努赛尔说，再过一年半，埃及国内的第一个钢铁厂将建成。
    努赛尔在回答记者问题时指出，目前埃及的对外贸易正在顺利地发展，“同苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家扩大贸易联系，在很大程度上有助于这个发展”。
    新华社十七日讯  开罗消息：埃及工商部长穆·阿·努赛尔十五日宣布，埃及政府成立了一个新的公司来扩大同包括中华人民共和国在内的亚非国家进行贸易。
    努赛尔说，这个公司的目的是要执行亚非会议的关于要求东方各国人民之间建立更密切的经济关系的决议。它将设法订立换货协定，以使埃及的对外贸易收支平衡。
    努赛尔还宣布，埃及内阁已经批准了最近同中国缔结的贸易协定。他指出，埃及对中国的贸易是顺差的，而埃及对西方国家的贸易有很大的逆差。他说：“我们认为中国是埃及最好的顾客”。
