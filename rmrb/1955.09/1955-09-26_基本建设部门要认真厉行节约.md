    Basic Construction Departments Must Conscientiously Practice Thrift
    Ma Nanfeng, President of the People's Construction Bank of China
    Since the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, opposing waste, and resolutely lowering non-productive construction standards, leading personnel of many construction units and construction enterprises have actively taken measures, gone deep into construction sites, mobilized the masses, and actively consulted with design departments to study specific measures and plans for saving investment and reducing construction costs. By revising unreasonable designs, eliminating extravagant decorations that do not conform to the principle of thrift, reducing unnecessary construction projects, mechanical equipment, and other expenses, construction funds have been greatly saved. The single dormitory building of Dalian Paint Factory, upon receiving instructions from the leading organs, had already reached 90 percent of its construction progress. After careful study, the project cost was still reduced from 90 yuan to 81 yuan per square meter. The Fifth Engineering Office of the Second Engineering Company of the Northeast Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, through mobilizing the masses, found 59 tricks for saving, and conducted research with construction units and design departments, reducing the project cost of projects under construction and more than 80 percent completed by 4.6 percent, and some by more than 12 percent. According to the statistics of the People's Construction Bank of China at the end of August on 1,482 construction units, a total of more than 360.97 million yuan was saved, a decrease of 15.57 percent compared with the original investment plan; among them, savings in non-productive construction amounted to 164.36 million yuan, a decrease of 25.49 percent compared with the original investment amount; savings in productive construction amounted to 196.61 million yuan, a decrease of 11.75 percent compared with the original investment amount. Among the funds saved, more than 148.94 million yuan belonged to design revisions and reductions in construction costs, accounting for 41.3 percent; more than 212.03 million yuan belonged to the reduction of unnecessary construction projects and mechanical equipment, accounting for 58.7 percent. Saving these funds is of great significance for ensuring key construction.
    However, in the work of practicing thrift, some units are still wasting state funds by various excuses and improper means.
    Some units lack a national concept and construction perspective, and for the sake of the partial interests of their own units, they do not hesitate to ask the state for more money. Under the control of this erroneous thinking, they will naturally not actively take measures to resolutely reduce project costs. The tea room projects built by Jinzhou Railway Bureau at stations such as Lijin, Quangou, and Biantai originally cost 72 to 101 yuan per square meter. After reducing the cost, it still reached 53 to 61 yuan, and although the proportion of the reduction was not small, it was still much higher than the cost standard for dormitory projects stipulated by the Ministry of Railways - 30 to 55 yuan per square meter (Northeast region). According to the Liaoning Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China, it is entirely possible to build tea room projects at a cost of 20 yuan per square meter or according to the standards for temporary construction.
    In order to ask the state for more funds, some units even want to regard the difference between the estimated cost and the budget as the achievement of reducing costs and saving. The estimated cost of the Changsha Bureau housing project of the Hunan Post and Telecommunications Administration stipulated 80 to 85 yuan per square meter. After the budget was compiled, it was only 73 yuan. The bureau believed that executing the budget could overfulfill the savings target set by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant also had this wrong idea. They forgot that cost reduction should be carried out on the basis of the budget.
    Another way to ask the state for more funds is to emphasize the special nature of the unit's work or projects, and refuse to save. The family dormitory project built by the Forestry and Soil Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences requires two wardrobes for each household, which alone will cost more than 3,000 yuan. What is so special about a family dormitory! The original design of the flooring project of the processing workshop office of Shenyang Cement Machinery Repair Plant was magnesite earth. The Shenyang Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China suggested changing it to cement flooring, but the workshop director said: "We have many female comrades here, cement floors are too cold, we need to take care of them." In fact, these special requirements and excuses were not proposed by female comrades. The ×× mine pit renovated and rebuilt by Xinqiu Mining Bureau of Fuxin Mining Administration planned to build a brick and wood structure office with a cost of 70 yuan per square meter. After inspection by the design department of Fuxin Mining Bureau, it was believed that it should be rebuilt as an earthen house with a cost of no more than 28 yuan per square meter, which would save more than 7,000 yuan. However, this mine did not adopt this suggestion which conformed to the principle of thrift. They said: "The Central Committee is calling for lowering the standards of non-productive construction, and our office at the pit entrance is not a non-productive building." As a result, it was still built according to the brick and wood structure. In fact, if earthen houses are built, they can be repaired once a year and can be used for 15 to 20 years, which is longer than the mining time of this pit. Even more unsatisfactory is the dog house project of China Medical University, with a cost of 92 yuan per square meter. The Shenyang Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China made four suggestions to them before the unit slightly modified the original design, but the cost was still as high as 78 yuan. Their reason is: "The dogs here eat milk and meat every day, so their living conditions don't necessarily have to be worse than people's." These people never think that arbitrarily wasting state funds is a criminal act.
    In order to build their own units' buildings better, some units falsely report the progress of the project. When the competent department issued savings targets for the construction of the Pavlov Research Laboratory of China Medical University, the actual construction progress was 60 percent, but it was falsely reported as 80 percent, so that the project with a cost of 135 yuan per square meter was still constructed according to the original design. Hunan Normal University also took the same approach, falsely reporting 30 percent of the project progress as 60 percent. Even more serious is the greenhouse and preparation room project of the Forestry and Soil Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which started construction without an approved construction budget or approval from the competent department, and the cost per square meter exceeded the highest standard stipulated by the competent department by 39 yuan. Not only that, this unit also misappropriated state investment without authorization, and changed the first floor of the single dormitory into a nursery. However, it is not that they did not have a nursery, but they disliked the original nursery's cement floor and abandoned it.
    In addition to the many wrong practices mentioned above, some units are perfunctory in their thrift work and have a "close enough" mentality. Therefore, they shout empty slogans about thrift, only have plans, do not let go to mobilize the masses, and have not formulated specific measures and plans for saving investment. Some, although they have plans, are only formulated by leading staff, and do not revise the construction budget. As a result, the plans cannot mobilize the masses and cannot guarantee realization. Some people think that "the project is nearing completion, and there is not much profit to be made from saving." Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory emphasized that the project was about to be completed, and it was impossible to complete the savings targets set by higher authorities. The first savings plan formulated was only equivalent to 55 percent of the savings mandated by the higher authorities. After the higher authorities re-instructed and sent people to help calculate, it reached 86.6 percent of the savings task stipulated by the higher authorities. Is it really impossible for this factory to save? Of course not. For example, the competent bureau suggested changing the cement floor of the canteen project under construction to a three-in-one soil floor, which would save about 1,000 yuan, but the factory did not adopt it; for the two dormitory buildings under construction, in order to compare with the six completed buildings, it was also emphasized that the new construction standards could not be followed. Some units are only satisfied with the savings targets set by the competent department (bureau), and even though they know there is potential for savings, they do not continue to explore. The design department and the Construction Bank both believed that the casing processing plant project of the Hunan Provincial Company of China Animal Products Company could save 7,000 yuan, but the factory believed that the competent department only stipulated a saving of 5,000 yuan, so they were unwilling to save the funds that could be saved. There are also some leading staff of units who do not use their brains and try to easily achieve savings results, and take savings measures that do not conform to the actual situation, resulting in new waste. The three-story dormitory project built by Benxi Construction Engineering Bureau started construction in early May and had already stored heating materials and repaired heating ditches, but then cut off the heating equipment from the design, which not only caused the accumulation of heating materials, but also wasted the repaired heating ditches. The Fushun Construction Bureau built a bungalow project to watch the water pump, with a total cost of 3,600 yuan. Due to blindly revising the design, this project was reduced, so that the material handling fee alone lost 1,600 yuan. Xinqiu Mining Bureau of Fuxin Mining Administration even wrongly proposed to reduce productive construction projects, and these projects are the main projects for completing the first five-year plan tasks. The reason why they want to do this is to cover up the serious shortcomings in the construction of these projects.
    It is very obvious that the various ideas and practices mentioned above run counter to the spirit of practicing thrift and opposing waste as instructed by the Central Committee. Therefore, it is recommended that party and government leading organs and competent departments at all levels further strengthen the leadership and inspection of this work, strengthen the education on practicing thrift, so that the staff of the affiliated enterprises and units fully understand the importance of saving construction funds, overcome those localist ideas that only pay attention to the beauty and grandeur of their own units' buildings and disregard the overall situation; overcome those complacent and conservative ideas that are satisfied with completing the savings targets stipulated by the competent department (bureau) and do not actively explore potential; change the practice of disregarding the actual situation, taking simple measures, and blindly reducing investment.
    The People's Construction Bank of China should further strengthen the inspection and supervision of the implementation of reducing investment and reducing costs. For units that do not seriously implement the regulations of the superior authorities, they should actively put forward their opinions and supervise corrections, and insist on fighting against wrong ideas. The Fuxin Sub-branch has done a good job in this regard. For example, the original plan of Fuxin Power Plant was to build a three-story dormitory project with a cost of 105.92 yuan per square meter. According to the regulations of the General Bureau of Electricity, it was necessary to build a bungalow with a cost of only 45 yuan per square meter. The factory emphasized that revising the design would cause material accumulation, so it insisted on building a building with a cost of 77.32 yuan per square meter. The Fuxin Sub-branch conducted a more detailed understanding of the above situation and found that the accumulated materials could be adjusted, so it promptly reported to the Municipal Party Committee. Finally, with the approval of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, bungalows were still built according to the regulations of the General Bureau of Electricity, saving the state more than 135,000 yuan. However, it must be pointed out that many branches of the People's Construction Bank of China have not yet carried out this work, and some even think that "reducing investment and reducing costs are matters for the construction unit and have nothing to do with the bank." This statement is very wrong and must be corrected immediately.

    基本建设部门要认真厉行节约
    中国人民建设银行行长　马南风
    自党中央和国务院发出增产节约、反对浪费和坚决降低非生产性建筑标准的指示以后，许多建设单位和建筑企业的领导人员都积极地采取措施，深入工地，发动群众，并同设计部门主动协商，研究节约投资和降低造价的具体措施计划，通过修改不合理的设计、剔除不符合节约原则的豪华装饰、削减不必要的建设项目、机械设备和其他费用开支，大大地节约了建设资金。大连油漆厂建筑的单身宿舍，在接到领导机关指示时，工程进度已达百分之九十，经过认真研究，仍使工程造价由每平方公尺九十元降至八十一元。建筑工程部东北管理总局第二工程公司第五工程处，通过发动群众，找出了五十九项节约的窍门，并同建设单位和设计部门进行研究，使正在施工并完成百分之八十以上的工程降低工程造价百分之四点六，有的高达百分之十二以上。据中国人民建设银行八月底对一千四百八十二个建设单位的统计，共节约投资三亿六千零九十七万多元，较原定的投资计划减少了百分之十五点五七；其中非生产性建筑方面的节约为一亿六千四百三十六万元，较原投资额减少百分之二五点四九；生产性建筑方面的节约为一亿九千六百六十一万元，较原投资额减少百分之十一点七五。在节约的这批资金中，属于修改设计、降低建筑造价的为一亿四千八百九十四万多元，占百分之四十一点三；属于削减不必要的建设项目和机械设备的为二亿一千二百零三万元，占百分之五十八点七。节约这些资金，对于保证重点建设具有重大的意义。
    但是，在厉行节约的工作中，有些单位仍在用各种各样的借口和不正当的手段浪费国家的资金。
    有些单位缺乏国家观念和建设观点，为了本单位局部的利益，不惜多向国家要钱。在这种错误思想的支配下，他们自然不会积极采取措施坚决降低工程造价。锦州铁路管理局在李金、泉沟、边台等车站修建的茶炉房工程，原计划每平方公尺造价七十二元至一百零一元，降低造价后仍达五十三元至六十一元，降低的比重虽然不小，但仍比铁道部规定的宿舍工程造价标准——每平方公尺三十元至五十五元（东北地区）高得多。据中国人民建设银行辽宁省分行反映，茶炉房工程按每平方公尺造价二十元或按暂设工程的标准修建是完全可能的。
    为了向国家多要资金，有些单位竟想把概算同预算的差额作为降低造价和节约的成绩。湖南邮电管理局长沙局房屋工程，概算规定每平方公尺为八十元至八十五元，预算编出以后，仅为七十三元，该局认为按预算执行就可超额完成邮电部规定的节约指标。沈阳重型机器厂也有这种错误的打算。他们忘记了降低造价应当在预算的基础上进行。
    向国家多要资金的另一种方法是强调本单位的工作或工程特殊，拒绝节约。中国科学院林业土壤研究所修建的家属宿舍工程，每个住户要设两个大衣柜，仅这一项就要多花三千多元。既是家属宿舍有什么特殊可言呢！沈阳水泥机械修配厂加工车间办公室地坪工程，原来设计的是菱苦土地面，中国人民建设银行沈阳分行建议改成水泥地面，车间主任却说：“我们这里女同志多，水泥地太凉，要照顾些”。事实上，这种特殊的要求和借口并不是女同志提出来的。阜新矿务局新邱矿恢复改建的××矿坑，计划修建砖木结构的办公室，每平方公尺造价七十元，经阜新矿务局设计处检查后，认为应改建土房，每平方公尺造价最高不得超过二十八元，这样就可以节约资金七千多元。而这个矿并未采纳这一符合节约原则的建议。他们说：“中央是号召降低非生产性建筑标准，我们这个坑口的办公室就不是非生产性建筑。”结果，仍按砖木结构修建。事实上如建筑土房，每年修补一次可用十五年至二十年，比这个矿坑的开采时间还要长。更令人不能满意的是中国医科大学的犬舍工程，每平方公尺造价九十二元，中国人民建设银行沈阳分行向他们提过四次建议，该单位才对原设计略微作了修改，但造价仍高达七十八元之多，他们的理由是：“这里的狗每天吃牛奶、肉类，住的当然也不一定要比人差。”这些人丝毫不想到随意浪费国家资金，是犯罪的行为。
    为了把本单位的建筑修建得好一些，有些单位竟虚报工程进度。中国医科大学建筑巴甫洛夫研究室，主管部门下达节约指标时，施工的实际进度为百分之六十，但虚报为百分之八十，使每平方公尺造价高达一百三十五元的工程仍按原设计施工。湖南师范学院也采取了同样办法，把百分之三十的工程进度虚报为百分之六十。更严重的是中国科学院林业土壤研究所的温室和准备室工程既没有批准的建设预算，也没有经过主管部门批准就擅自抢先开工，每平方公尺造价超过主管部门规定的最高标准三十九元。不仅如此，这个单位还擅自挪用了国家的投资，把单身宿舍的一楼改为托儿所。可是，他们并不是没有托儿所，只是嫌原来的托儿所是水泥地面，就放弃不用了。
    除掉前述许多错误的做法外，还有一些单位草率从事节约工作，有“差不多”的思想。于是空喊节约，只有计划，不放手发动群众，没有制定节约投资的具体措施计划，有的虽有计划也只是由领导工作人员制定的，也不修改建设预算，结果计划不能动员群众，无法保证实现。有的人认为“工程已近尾声，节约的油水不大了”。衡阳矿山机械厂强调工程快要完工，没法完成上级机关规定的节约指标，第一次制定的节约计划只相当于上级机关规定的百分之五十五，经过上级机关再次指示并派人具体帮助计算后，才达到上级机关规定的节约任务的百分之八十六点六。这个厂真的不可能节约吗？当然不是。如正在修建的食堂工程，主管局建议把水泥地面改为三合土地面，约可节约一千元，但厂方并没有采纳；正在修建的两幢宿舍工程，为了同已经完工的六幢比美，也强调不能按照新的建筑标准执行。有的单位只满足于主管部（局）规定的节约指标，明知有节约潜力，也不继续挖掘。中国畜产公司湖南省公司肠衣加工厂工程，设计部门和建设银行都认为可以节约七千元，但厂方认为主管部门只规定节约五千元，因而对可能节约的资金就不愿再节约了。还有些单位的领导工作人员不动脑筋，企图轻易取得节约成绩，便采取了不符合实际情况的节约措施，结果造成新的浪费。本溪市建筑工程局承建的三幢三层楼宿舍工程，五月初已经开工，早已储备了暖气材料，并且修好了暖气沟，但又从设计上把暖气设备削掉，不仅造成暖气材料积压，已经修好的暖气沟也白费了。抚顺建设局修建一座看水泵的平房工程，总造价三千六百元，由于盲目修改设计，把这项工程削减了，以致仅材料搬运费一项即损失了一千六百元。阜新矿务局新邱矿竟错误地提出削减生产性的建设项目，而这些项目都是完成第一个五年计划任务的主要工程，他们所以要这样作，原来是为了掩盖这些工程在施工中的严重缺点。
    十分明显，以上所举的各种想法和作法，都是同中央所指示的厉行节约、反对浪费的精神背道而驰的。因此，建议各级党政领导机关和主管部门进一步加强对这一工作的领导检查、加强厉行节约的教育，使所属企业单位的工作人员充分了解节约建设资金的重要，克服那些只注意本单位建筑漂亮、阔气而不顾大局的本位主义思想；克服那些满足于完成主管部（局）规定的节约指标而不积极挖掘潜力的自满情绪和保守思想；改变那种不顾实际情况、采取简单措施、盲目削减投资的作法。
    中国人民建设银行要进一步加强对削减投资和降低造价的执行情况的检查和监督。对于不认真执行上级机关规定的单位，应积极向他们提出意见，监督纠正，要坚持向错误的思想进行斗争。阜新支行在这方面作得比较好。例如，阜新发电厂原计划修建的三层楼宿舍工程，每平方公尺造价一百零五元九角二分，按照电业总局规定要修建平房，每平方公尺造价仅四十五元，厂方却强调修改设计要造成材料积压，因此坚持要按每平方公尺七十七元三角二分的造价盖楼房。阜新支行对上述情况进行了比较详细的了解，发现积压材料可以调剂，因而及时向市委作了汇报，最后经中共辽宁省委员会批准仍按电业总局规定修建平房，为国家节约了十三万五千多元。但必须指出：中国人民建设银行的许多行处还没有开展这方面的工作，有的甚至认为“削减投资，降低造价是建设单位的事，同银行没有关系”，这种说法是十分错误的，必须立即纠正。
