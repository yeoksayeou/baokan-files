Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Construction of China's first tractor manufacturing plant officially began on the 15th. At 6:00 AM that day, a well-trained construction team entered the factory area and began excavating and laying the foundation for the general warehouse of the plant. The construction of the auxiliary workshops, non-ferrous metal repair casting workshops, and forging workshops, planned for this year, will commence successively within the next month. The remaining construction projects of the factory and the workshops of various power stations will commence in the coming year and the year after that.

The Soviet Union is assisting China in building this factory with the most advanced technology. The entire factory is designed very reasonably. Many important and precise equipment will be supplied by the Soviet Union. The entire production process will be mechanized and automated. After the tractor parts are produced by various workshops and departments, they will be sent by automatic conveyor belts to the assembly line of the tractor workshop's general assembly department for automatic assembly. All technical and economic indicators of the entire factory meet the advanced Soviet standards.

Chinese design units are responsible for the architectural technical design of the factory's nine workshops and the workshops of various power stations. This is the first time that Chinese engineers have designed such a large factory building. During the design process, the design units studied the architectural drawings designed by the Soviet Union for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and Soviet experts provided specific guidance. After the design was completed, Soviet experts reviewed and revised the design. As a result, the construction and building units are very satisfied with the designed drawings.

The construction of this factory will adopt mechanized and industrialized construction methods. Components such as beams, columns, roof trusses, roof panels, and doors and windows on the factory buildings are prefabricated in the processing plant in advance, and then loaded into the construction site with automatic loaders or other modern transportation tools, and hoisted or installed onto the buildings mechanically.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Production preparations for China's first tractor manufacturing plant have already begun.

The factory has compiled various plans for the preparation of production personnel based on the preliminary design, the overall factory construction plan, the workshop layout plan, and the experience of other factories, and has begun to gather and train them in batches. Currently, a large number of workers are being trained in relevant factories and technical schools across the country. Many engineering and technical personnel and management cadres are going to relevant factories, universities, or relevant factories in the Soviet Union for study and internship.

The specifications and quantities of various raw materials used in the manufacture of tools and the production of tractors are being calculated. The sources of the hundreds of cooperative products on tractors that need to be supplied by other factories have been preliminarily investigated.

The technical design that Soviet experts have helped the factory with has arrived. The design arranges the entire technological process from the input of raw materials to the production of tractors very precisely and reasonably. After the factory revises the overall production preparation plan based on the design data, the production preparation work can be fully launched.

    拖拉机制造厂动工兴建
    工厂的生产准备工作已经开始进行
    新华社十六日讯中国第一个拖拉机制造厂在十五日正式动工兴建。这天上午六时，一支经过锻炼的建筑队伍进入厂区，开始在这个厂的总仓库的地基上挖土打基础。计划在今年建设的辅助工场、有色金属修理铸件工场和锻工场的厂房，将在今后的一个月内陆续施工。这个厂其余的建筑工程和各个动力站的厂房，将分别在明年和后年动工。
    苏联正以最先进的技术援助中国建设这座工厂。整个工厂设计得非常合理。许多重要的精密的设备，将由苏联供应。整个生产过程都是机械化和自动化的。当拖拉机的部件由各个工场车间生产出来以后，就由自动传送带送到拖拉机工场总装配车间的装配台上，进行自动装配。全厂的各种技术经济指标，都是苏联的先进标准。
    中国的设计单位担负了这个厂的九个工场和各个动力站厂房的建筑技术设计。中国工程师设计这样大的厂房还是第一次。在设计过程中，设计单位研究了苏联给第一汽车制造厂设计的建筑图纸，苏联专家并进行了具体的指导。设计完成以后，苏联专家又对设计进行了审查和修改。结果设计出来的图纸，建设单位和施工单位都很满意。
    这个厂的建筑工程，将采用机械化、工业化施工方法。厂房上的梁、柱、屋架、屋面板和门窗等构件，都是事先在加工厂预制好，然后用自动装卸车或其它现代化的运输工具载入施工现场，用机械吊装或安装到建筑物上去。
    新华社十六日讯中国第一个拖拉机制造厂的生产准备工作，已经开始进行。
    这个厂已根据初步设计、建厂总体计划、车间平面布置图和外厂经验，编制了生产人员准备的各项计划，并开始分批结集和培养。现在，已经有一大批工人正在各地有关工厂和技工学校里受训。很多工程技术人员和管理干部，到有关工厂、大学或苏联有关工厂去学习和实习。
    制造工具和生产拖拉机时用的各种原材料的规格、数量等正着手计算。需要外厂供应拖拉机上的几百种合作产品的来源，已经初步调查清楚。
    苏联专家帮助这个厂做的技术设计已经来到。设计把从投入原材料到制出拖拉机的整个工艺过程，安排得非常精确合理。等这个厂根据设计资料把生产准备总体计划加以修订后，生产准备工作就可全面地展开。
