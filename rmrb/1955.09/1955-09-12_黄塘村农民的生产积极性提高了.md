    Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production Increases in Huangtang Village
    Xie Jing, Fu Da
    When the farmers of Huangtang Village, Shatin Township, Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, talk about the "Three Fixes" for grain, many will happily say, "In addition to fixing production, purchasing, and marketing, the 'Three Fixes' also achieve 'peace of mind'." Knowing the bottom line for selling and retaining grain, the farmers have a clear idea and are at ease to actively produce. Take fertilizer accumulation as an example. To date, farmers in Huangtang Village have applied more than 4,000 dan of sod, garbage mud, cow dung, and other miscellaneous fertilizers to their rice paddies, which is unprecedented in Huangtang Village. Before the "Three Fixes," the farmers here did not have the habit of accumulating fertilizer, and in addition, many farmers had misunderstandings about the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, so the enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer could not be aroused. After the "Three Fixes," the farmers knew the policy of "increased production, no increased purchase, and the amount of grain purchased remains unchanged for three years." The misunderstanding of the grain unified purchase and sale policy was gradually eliminated, and the enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. Therefore, not long ago, 80 percent of the village's main labor force was devoted to fertilizer accumulation. Farmer Deng Bingjun used to be afraid that increased production would mean selling more grain, so he only focused on the sideline occupation of picking bamboo shoots and was unwilling to accumulate fertilizer. After the "Three Fixes," he actively produced, accumulating fertilizer for six consecutive days, applying an average of 50 dan of fertilizer to each mu of rice field. Deng Huilong, a 70-year-old farmer, rarely accumulated fertilizer in the past, but after the "Three Fixes," he also accumulated 20 dan. When asked why he accumulated more fertilizer this year than in the past, he replied, "To increase production! The 'Three Fixes' have been decided. Increasing production and selling enough surplus grain is beneficial to the country, and I can also keep more grain for myself."
    There are seven mutual aid teams in this village. In the past, some team members were afraid that others would know how much grain they harvested, and that increased production would mean selling more surplus grain, so they requested to withdraw from the team. Deng Lu, the mutual aid team leader, sold some "excess grain" during the autumn grain unified purchase last year, and also mobilized team members to sell some "excess grain." Therefore, the team members had many opinions about him. He felt that it was difficult to be a mutual aid team leader and had proposed not to be a mutual aid team leader anymore. Later, after listening to the publicity and explanation of the "Three Fixes" policy, his ideological concerns gradually disappeared, and he firmly expressed his determination to actively run the mutual aid team well and to prepare conditions for transitioning to a cooperative.
    After the "Three Fixes" in Huangtang Village, many people made arrangements for their grain consumption in advance. Farmer Wu Kui had 1,021 jin of rice left over from last year after paying public grain and selling surplus grain, which was enough for her family of two to eat. However, she did not plan her grain consumption, eating and using it indiscriminately, and also left more than one mu of land barren. As a result, the grain she retained was not enough to eat, and the state had to supply her with 200 jin of rice. This year, the amount of grain her family retained is about the same as last year. She plans to eat about 40 jin of grain per person per month. She also decided to use the barren land to grow two mu of sweet potatoes this year. She said, "This year, I guarantee that I will not need the state to supply grain." Planned grain consumption can save grain. Deng Xingui also had no plan for grain consumption in the past, often putting too much rice when cooking, and using a large amount of leftover rice and pot scrapings to feed pigs, resulting in a shortage of grain in July this year, requiring the state to supply grain. Now, he knows the amount of grain he retained and realizes that wasting grain will affect the completion of the task of selling surplus grain and will also affect his own life. Now he makes sure to cook as much rice as he eats every day and prepares to grow more sweet potatoes to solve the problem of pig feed, and will no longer use grain to feed pigs in the future. In this way, he can save more than 200 jin of rice a year.
    In recent days, on the small road leading to the state grain station in Huangtang Village, many farmers carry their surplus grain to sell to the state according to the "Three Fixes" plan every day. Some farmers have completed more than 60 percent of their annual grain sales task. After receiving the grain money, the farmers bought lime and chemical fertilizers to use as top dressing for late rice. In the past, they were accustomed to weeding the fields once, but this year many farmers will weed the fields twice, striving for a bumper harvest of late rice.

    黄塘村农民的生产积极性提高了
    谢京　富达
    广东清远县沙田乡黄塘村的农民谈起粮食“三定”，很多人都会高兴地说：“‘三定’除了定产、定购、定销外，还做到‘定心’。”农民知道了卖粮、留粮的底，心中有数，就安心积极生产了。就拿积肥做例子吧。到目前止，黄塘村农民已在稻田上施了四千多担草皮泥、垃圾泥、牛粪等杂肥，这在黄塘村是从来没有过的事。“三定”以前，这里的农民没有积肥的习惯，再加上不少农民对粮食统购统销政策有误解，积肥的热情始终掀不起来。经过粮食“三定”，农民知道了“增产不增购，购粮数量三年不变”的政策，对粮食统购统销政策的误解逐渐消除了，生产积极性大大提高了，因此，不久以前，全村百分之八十的主要劳动力都投入了积肥工作。农民邓炳钧过去怕增产要多卖粮食，只顾去做挑山竹的副业而不肯积肥；“三定”以后，他积极生产，一连积了六天肥，平均在每亩禾田上施了五十担肥料。七十岁的老农邓惠隆过去一向很少积肥，“三定”后也积了二十担。问他为什么今年比过去多积了肥料，他回答说：“为了增产呀！‘三定’已定下来，增了产卖够余粮对国家有利，自己也可以多留粮。”
    这个村有七个互助组。过去有的组员怕别人知道自己收多少谷，增产多要多卖余粮，因此要求退组。互助组长邓路，去年秋季粮食统购时，卖了一部分“过头粮”，还发动组员也卖出了一些“过头粮”，所以组员对他有很多意见，他感到互助组长很难当，曾提出不再当互助组长了。后来他听了“三定”政策的宣传解释后，思想顾虑逐渐解除，坚决表示要积极搞好互助组，并要准备条件转社。
    黄塘村在粮食“三定”后，不少人都预先对自己的粮食消费作了安排。农民吴葵去年交了公粮，卖了余粮，还剩下一千零二十一斤稻谷，这本来足够她一家两口人吃的。但她用粮没有计划，乱吃乱用，还把一亩多地丢荒了。结果，弄得自留的粮食不够吃，要国家供应她二百斤米。今年她家留粮同去年差不多，她计划一个人一个月大约吃四十斤谷。她还决定今年要利用丢荒的地种两亩番薯。她说：“今年我保证不要国家供应粮食了。”有计划地用粮就能节约粮食。邓新桂原来用粮也没有计划，煮饭时经常多放米，把大量的剩饭、锅巴拿来喂猪，以致今年七月缺粮，要国家供应粮食。现在，他知道了自己的留粮数，认识到如果浪费粮食，会影响卖余粮任务的完成，也会影响自己的生活。现在他每天已做到吃多少就煮多少米，并准备多种番薯解决猪的饲料问题，今后不再用粮食喂猪。这样，他一年就可节约二百多斤稻谷。
    近日来，在黄塘村通往国家粮站的小道上，每天都有不少农民按“三定”计划把余粮挑去卖给国家。有些农民已完成全年卖粮任务百分之六十以上。农民在得了粮款后，即纷纷买回石灰、化学肥料，作为晚稻中耕追肥之用。过去他们习惯于耘田一次，而今年有很多农民都要耘田两次，争取晚稻丰收。
