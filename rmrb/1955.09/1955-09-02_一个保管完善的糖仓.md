    A Well-Managed Sugar Warehouse
    Chen Xueneng
    The three and a half sugar warehouses of the Changsha State-owned Commercial Storage Company in Hunan Province stored over 9 million catties of sugar this year without any melting. As of early July, a total of more than 2.6 million catties of brown sugar had been dispatched, with a loss of only 171 catties, reducing the loss rate by 99% compared to the rate stipulated by higher authorities, saving the state 11,727 catties of sugar.

    Sugar is susceptible to wind, moisture, and heat, making it a difficult commodity to store. In May and June of 1953, the sugar stored by the storage company melted severely. The warehouse floor was covered with sugar water one or two inches deep, and swarming with flies. In that year, the loss rate of raw sugar alone reached 0.42%, exceeding the loss rate stipulated by higher authorities by 172%. In March and April of last year, the company established a sugar storage research group, and tried the advanced method of "burying sugar with old chaff" used by the Guangdong Provincial Trading Company. The sugar bags were stacked layer by layer, with a layer of sugar and a layer of old chaff, and the surrounding area was also enclosed with old chaff. This initially found a way to prevent sugar from melting.

    In November last year, the company leaders transferred Wang Shumin, a young female accountant and Communist Party member, to serve as the leader of the Third Storage Group (responsible for paper and sugar warehouses), and subsequently transferred Youth League members Deng Yansheng and Hu XX to serve as custodians. These young Communist Party members and Youth League members actively engaged in the struggle to stop sugar melting. They decided to continue to promote the "old chaff burying sugar method." Before the sugar even entered the warehouse, they were busy padding old chaff and preparing "zhezi" (不知道怎么翻译). In February this year, sugar began to enter the warehouse in large quantities. They were receiving and stacking goods while using old chaff to pad the bottom and surround the stacks. In the process of promoting the "old chaff burying sugar method," some people believed that sugar could not be prevented from melting, or were afraid that the old chaff would be dirty and spoil the sugar; some people were afraid of trouble and were unwilling to pad chaff layer by layer when stacking sugar bags. When encountering such situations, Wang Shumin always patiently explained to everyone that sugar should be prevented from melting, and explained the benefits of this method, giving everyone confidence and determination. In May, the company launched a summer safety campaign. The leaders called on everyone to fight against the phenomenon of dampness and mold. The staff of the sugar warehouse carefully inspected the warehouse and found that some of the "zhezi" were not well enclosed, and some of the "zhezi" did not have old chaff in the middle, exposing the sugar bags. They drilled holes in these "zhezi" to check the bottom layer of sugar bags, and found that the bottom of one bag of sugar was damp because there was too little chaff padding. Because the sugar bags were not tightly squeezed together and there were gaps, a small number of sugar bags were also damp. Finally, they also conducted temperature tests. Through this meticulous inspection, everyone found many shortcomings and loopholes in their work, further understood the moisture-proof, heat-insulating, and wind-insulating properties of old chaff, and strengthened their determination to promote the "old chaff burying sugar method."

    Soon, the leaders put forward the slogan of reducing loss indicators, requiring the loss rate of white sugar to be reduced by 90% compared to the loss quota stipulated by higher authorities, and brown sugar to be reduced by 60%. If this plan is realized, the entire warehouse can reduce the loss of sugar by more than 34,000 catties this year. At the same time, the leaders also called on everyone to strive to ensure that the sugar does not melt. At the beginning, everyone felt unsure and did not dare to make guarantees. But after the persuasion and encouragement of the Party branch secretary, Wang Shumin happily accepted this glorious task first, and other staff also increased their confidence. Worker Li Hualu was very careful in protecting the sugar. In order to prevent people entering the warehouse from stepping on the sugar bags, he often got up before dawn to set up wooden boards and pave the way for everyone. They also created some experience. For example, the windows must be sealed with paper to prevent sunlight from entering; the windows and doors should not be kept closed all the time, but must be opened in a timely manner depending on the season and climate, in order to ventilate and dissipate moisture and heat.

    Through everyone's hard work, and under the continuous care and guidance of the Party, they gloriously realized the Party's requirements and created the first well-managed sugar warehouse in the province. (Excerpted and adapted from the New Hunan Daily)

    一个保管完善的糖仓
    陈学能
    湖南长沙国营商业仓储公司的三个半食糖仓库，今年保管九百多万斤食糖，没有发生融化的现象。截至七月上旬，共调出二百六十多万斤红糖，只损耗了一百七十一斤，比上级规定的损耗率降低了百分之九十九，使国家少损失食糖一万一千七百二十七斤。
    食糖怕风、怕潮、怕热，是较难保管的商品。一九五三年五、六月间，仓储公司保管的食糖融化得很厉害，仓库地上流着一、两寸深的糖水，地上爬满了苍蝇。这一年仅赤砂糖的损耗率即达百分之零点四二，超过上级规定的损耗率百分之一百七十二。去年三、四月间，公司里成立了保管食糖研究小组，试用了广东省贸易公司“老糠埋糖”的先进办法，将糖包一层一层地堆码，堆一层食糖，垫一层老糠，周围也用老糠围起来，初步找到了防止食糖融化的办法。
    去年十一月，公司领导上调年青的女会计、共产党员王淑民去担任第三保管小组组长（管纸和糖的仓库），随着又陆续调青年团员邓炎生和胡?兴担任保管员。这些年青的共产党员和青年团员积极地投入了制止食糖融化的斗争。他们决定继续推行“老糠埋糖法”。食糖还没有进仓，他们便忙着垫老糠，准备摺子。今年二月，食糖开始大量入库了，他们一面收货堆码，一面把老糠垫底围垛。在推行“老糠埋糖法”的过程中，也曾经有人认为食糖不可能不融化，或是怕老糠脏搞坏了糖；有的人怕麻烦，不愿在堆码糖包时层层垫糠，面面围糠。遇到这样的情况，王淑民总是耐心地向大家说明应当防止食糖融化，讲解这个办法的好处，使大家有了信心和决心。五月，公司里开展了夏防安全运动。领导上号召大家向潮霉现象作斗争。食糖仓库的工作人员们认真地检查了仓库，发现有的摺子没有围好，有的摺子当中没有老糠，糖包露在外面，在这些摺子中打洞抽查底层的糖包，发现有一包糖的下面因为糠垫少了，受了潮；由于糖包同糖包之间挤得不紧，有缝隙，也有少数的糖包受潮。最后他们还作了温度测验。经过这一次细致的检查，大家找到了工作中的许多缺点和漏洞，进一步摸到了用老糠隔潮、隔热、隔风的性能，推行“老糠埋糖法”的决心更坚定了。
    不久，领导上提出了降低损耗指标的口号。要求白糖的损耗率比上级规定的损耗定额降低百分之九十，红糖降低百分之六十。如果实现这个计划，今年全仓库就可以少损耗食糖三万四千多斤。同时领导上还号召大家为保证不使食糖融化而奋斗。开始时大家感到没有把握，不敢提出保证。但经过党支部书记的说服和鼓励，王淑民首先愉快地接受了这个光荣的任务，其他工作人员也提高了信心。工人李华禄保护食糖很细心，为了不让进仓的人踩在糖包上，他经常天不亮就起床搭木板，给大家铺好路。他们还创造了一些经验。例如窗子必须用纸封闭起来，以免太阳光射进去；窗子和门不能经常关着不开，一定要掌握季节和气候适时打开，以便通风散走湿气和热气等。
    经过大家辛勤的努力，在党的不断关怀和指导下，他们光荣地实现了党的要求，创造了全省第一个保管完善的糖仓。（摘编自新湖南报）
