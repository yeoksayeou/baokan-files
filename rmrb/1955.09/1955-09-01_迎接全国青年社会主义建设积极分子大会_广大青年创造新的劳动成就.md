Xinhua News Agency, August 31st – The broad masses of youth across the country are constantly creating new achievements in their respective production and work posts to welcome the upcoming National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism for Youth in Beijing.

From many factories, mines, and basic construction sites, good news of production from young workers engaged in creative labor continues to pour in. The 42 youth groups of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory all overfulfilled their production tasks in July. The production task for the young worker Zhang Quanlu was completely fulfilled by August 10th this year. The red flag bulletins, blackboard bulletins, and glory bulletins of this factory are constantly publishing the outstanding labor achievements of young workers. In order to welcome the convening of the congress, labor model Chen Chongxin of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory worked hard to learn advanced experience, reducing the efficiency of cutting gears from 40 minutes per gear in the past to 14 minutes now. The young workers of Anshan are responding to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to convene this congress with practical actions to vigorously build the steel capital and actively participate in the increased production and thrift labor competition. The young heating shift workers of the large rolling mill are striving to achieve the guaranteed conditions of the competition, regardless of how scorching the hot material of the initial rolled steel is and how high the temperature of the heating furnace is. Many young workers have also repeatedly broken quotas in production and created new production records.

Since the announcement of the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to convene the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism for Youth, many young workers in factories and mines have more enthusiastically participated in the youth thrift teams and launched thrift activities such as saving raw materials, collecting waste materials, and utilizing waste materials. More than 10,000 young people in 18 units, including the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the Datong Coal Mine, and the Taiyuan Railway Administration, have collected more than 528 tons of scrap steel, worth 79,200 yuan. Many young workers also used these waste materials to replace raw materials. In less than half a month, the young workers of the Nanjing Film Machinery Factory used waste materials to punch out 6,140 parts, and the quality was also very good.

To welcome the convening of this congress, the youth in rural areas are also redoubling their efforts to participate in field labor such as accumulating fertilizer, eliminating insects, fighting drought, and harvesting wheat. The rural youth in Henan Province launched a movement to accumulate thousands of carts and ten thousand loads of fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties including Boai, more than 400,000 carts of fertilizer have been accumulated. More than 23,600 young men and women in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, organized grain picking teams, and in just ten days during the wheat harvest season, they picked up more than 109,000 kilograms of wheat lost on the ground.

In many agricultural production cooperatives, the youth also proposed to strive to be excellent members to welcome this congress. More than 5,600 members of the Communist Youth League and young people in Guo Houqi, Heilongjiang Province, are taking practical actions to strive to be excellent members. So far, 238 young people have been selected as model members. In the 215 agricultural production cooperatives in Lantian County, Shaanxi Province, 343 outstanding young members who care about cooperative affairs, work actively, and cherish public property have emerged.

On the front line of defending the motherland, the young soldiers of the troops are also cheered by the upcoming congress. They all expressed their determination to be excellent national defense fighters and resolutely defend the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

The youth in commerce, culture, education, health and other departments are also welcoming the upcoming Congress of Active Builders of Socialism for Youth with practical actions of studying hard and working actively.

    广大青年创造新的劳动成就
    新华社三十一日讯　全国广大青年正在各个生产和工作岗位上不断地创造出新成就，来迎接即将在北京召开的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    从许多工厂、矿山和基本建设工地上，不断传来青年工人进行着创造性的劳动的生产捷报。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的四十二个青年小组，七月份都超额完成了生产任务。青年工人张全路今年的生产任务，到八月十日就已全部完成。这个工厂的红旗报、黑板报和光荣报上，不断登载着青年工人出色的劳动成绩。沈阳矿山机器厂劳动模范陈崇信为了迎接大会的召开，努力学习先进经验，使车齿轮的效率由过去每车一个需要四十分钟缩短到现在的十四分钟。鞍山的青年工人们正以努力建设钢都、积极参加增产节约劳动竞赛的实际行动，响应青年团中央关于召开这次大会的决定。大型轧钢厂青年加热班的职工们不管初轧钢的热料多么烤人，加热炉的高温多么热，仍然努力实现着竞赛的保证条件。还有许多青年工人，在生产中一再地突破了定额，创造出生产上的新纪录。
    青年团中央关于召开全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的决定公布以来，不少工厂、矿山的青年职工更加踊跃地参加了青年节约队，展开了节约原材料、搜集废料、利用废料等节约活动。太原钢铁厂、大同煤矿、太原铁路管理局等十八个单位里，就有一万多名青年搜集了废钢铁五百二十八吨多，价值七万九千二百元。许多青年工人还利用这些废料代替原材料。南京电影机械厂的青年工人不到半个月内，就利用废料冲成六千一百四十个零件，而且质量也很好。
    为迎接这次大会的召开，农村中的青年也正在加倍努力地参加积肥、除虫、抗旱和麦收等田间劳动。河南省农村青年展开了千车万担积肥运动。据博爱等十个县的不完全统计，已积肥四十多万车。黑龙江省拜泉县两万三千六百多名男女青年组织了拣粮队，在麦收季节里，仅仅十天就拾回了失落在地里的麦子十万九千多斤。
    在许多农业生产合作社里，青年们还提出了要争取做一个优秀社员来迎接这次大会。黑龙江省郭后旗已有五千六百多个青年团员和青年正以自己的实际行动争取做一个优秀社员。到目前为止，已有二百三十八名青年被选为模范社员。陕西省蓝田县二百一十五个农业生产合作社里，已涌现出三百四十三名关心社务、积极劳动、爱护公共财产的青年优秀社员。
    在保卫祖国的战线上，部队的青年战士们也都为即将召开的大会而欢欣鼓舞。他们都表示要做一个优秀的国防战士，坚决保卫祖国的社会主义建设事业。
    在商业、文化、教育、卫生等部门中的青年，也正以努力学习，积极工作的实际行动迎接即将召开的青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
