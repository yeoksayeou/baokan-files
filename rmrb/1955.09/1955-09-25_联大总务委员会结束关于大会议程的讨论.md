Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 24th: The United Nations General Committee concluded its discussion on the General Assembly agenda on the 22nd, according to TASS.

    The majority of the afternoon and evening sessions on the 22nd were spent discussing the recommendation to include the Algerian question on the General Assembly agenda. Representatives from Egypt, Iraq, Thailand, India, and Pakistan, representing the fourteen Asian-African countries that proposed discussing this issue at the current session of the UN General Assembly, reminded everyone of the unsettling situation that had formed in Algeria due to the actions of the French government. They pointed out that the Algerian situation was intensifying, and they firmly advocated including this issue on the General Assembly agenda.

    Egyptian representative Fawzi said that the General Assembly must take measures to try to stop the suppression of the Algerian people, who desire independence and autonomy. The French government is using force against the Algerian people and refusing to negotiate with the true representatives of the Algerian people. This undermines the United Nations Charter and poses a threat to peace and security in the region.

    Indian representative Menon pointed out in his speech that a large part of the armed forces currently stationed in Algeria are not French armed forces, but the armed forces of the North Atlantic Alliance, who are using a member state of the alliance to achieve their own goals in Algeria. Menon said that this is "France waging a colonial war with its partners."

    Soviet representative Kuznetsov pointed out in his speech that the resolution of the Twenty-Nine Nations Asian-African Bandung Conference once called on the French government to immediately resolve this issue peacefully. The recent events in Algeria show that this call has not received the attention it deserves from the French government. The Algerian issue has caused unease among many neighboring countries. We believe that, like the Moroccan issue, the United Nations cannot ignore the events in Algeria. The United Nations General Assembly should discuss the Algerian issue in order to help peacefully resolve this issue in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, while taking into account the rights and interests of the parties concerned.

    Representatives from France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand spoke out against including this issue on the General Assembly agenda.

    The General Committee rejected the recommendation to include the Algerian issue on the General Assembly agenda by a vote of eight to five. Those who voted against this recommendation included France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Those who voted in favor of including this issue on the agenda included the Soviet Union, Poland, Egypt, and Thailand. Two members of the committee abstained.

    Subsequently, the General Committee decided to recommend that the General Assembly include a number of political, socio-economic, organizational, and budgetary issues on the agenda.

    The General Committee's decision is in the nature of a recommendation to the General Assembly. Therefore, whether the issues rejected by the committee will be included on the General Assembly agenda will still be discussed by the General Assembly in plenary session.

    联大总务委员会结束关于大会议程的讨论
    新华社二十四日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会二十二日结束了关于大会议程的讨论。
    二十二日下午和晚间会议大部分时间是讨论关于把阿尔及利亚问题列入大会议程的建议。埃及、伊拉克、泰国、印度和巴基斯坦的代表，代表建议在联合国大会本届会议上讨论这一问题的十四个亚非国家，提醒大家注意由于法国政府的行动而在阿尔及利亚形成的不安局势。他们指出阿尔及利亚局势在尖锐化，他们坚决主张把这一问题列入大会议程。
    埃及代表法齐说，大会必须采取措施设法制止对希望独立自主的阿尔及利亚人民施行的镇压。法国政府对阿尔及利亚人民使用武力，拒绝同阿尔及利亚人民的真正代表进行谈判。这样就破坏了联合国宪章，对这个地区的和平和安全形成了威胁。
    印度代表梅农在发言中指出，现在驻扎阿尔及利亚的很大一部分武装部队不是法国武装部队，而是北大西洋联盟的武装部队，他们利用联盟的一个会员国来达到自己在阿尔及利亚的目的。梅农说道，这是“法国同它的伙伴一起进行殖民战争”。
    苏联代表库兹涅佐夫发言指出，亚非二十九个国家万隆会议的决议中曾经呼吁法国政府立即和平解决这一问题。不久前在阿尔及利亚发生的事件说明了，这个呼吁没有获得法国政府应有的注意。阿尔及利亚问题已经引起了许多邻国的不安。我们认为，同摩洛哥问题一样，联合国不能对阿尔及利亚事件置之不理。联合国大会应当讨论阿尔及利亚问题，以便根据联合国宪章原则在照顾到有关方面的权利和利益的情况下帮助和平解决这个问题。
    法国、英国、美国和新西兰代表发言反对把这个问题列入大会议程。
    总务委员会以八票对五票否决了把阿尔及利亚问题列入大会议程的建议。投票反对这个建议的有法国、美国、英国、新西兰等。赞成把这个问题列入议程的有苏联、波兰、埃及、泰国等。委员会的两名委员弃权。
    随后，总务委员会决定建议大会把许多政治、社会经济、组织和预算问题列入议程。
    总务委员会的决定是向大会提出建议的性质，因此已经为委员会否决的问题是否列入大会议程，还将由大会全体会议讨论。
