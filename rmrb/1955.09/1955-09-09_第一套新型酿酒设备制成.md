    First Set of New-Type Winemaking Equipment Made
    The state-owned Shanghai Tobacco Industrial Machinery Factory has manufactured a complete set of winemaking equipment for the newly built Beijing Wine Factory. This set of winemaking equipment was completed on September 5th. The main components, such as the distillation tower, grape skin distiller, and sterilizer, have been shipped to Beijing. The final large filter was inspected and painted for packaging on the 5th. This equipment can produce 1,500 liters of wine per hour and is the first set of new-type winemaking machinery designed and manufactured in China.
    In the past, this factory specialized in repairing and fitting cigarette machines for cigarette factories. After liberation, it manufactured a batch of variable-speed gearboxes and sluice gate hoisting machines for the Huai River harnessing project. Last year, industrial construction departments in various regions also ordered many industrial machines from this factory. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    第一套新型酿酒设备制成
    国营上海烟草工业机械一厂为北京新建葡萄酒工厂制造了全套的酿酒设备。这套酿酒设备已在九月五日全部制成，主要的部件如蒸馏塔、葡萄皮蒸馏机、杀菌机等已运到北京，最后一套大过滤机在五日那天经过检验后也已上漆装箱。这套设备每小时可以生产一千五百公升葡萄酒，是中国自己设计制造的第一套新型酿酒机器。
    这个厂过去专门为卷烟厂修配卷烟机器，解放后，曾为治淮工程制造过一批变速齿轮箱和闸门启闭机，去年各地工业建设部门又向这个厂订购了许多工业机器。（据新华社讯）
