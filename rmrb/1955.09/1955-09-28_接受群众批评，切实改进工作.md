Accepting Mass Criticism, Conscientiously Improving Work

Benxi Coal Mine Improves Raw Coal Recovery Rate

Editor:

The People's Daily readers' criticism of our mine's waste of raw coal has spurred us to improve our work.

At the beginning of this year, we had already begun to pay attention to waste phenomena such as the discarding of raw coal, and decided to take some measures to correct it. After the "Reader's Letters" column published readers' letters of criticism on April 24th, we further researched the issue. In the anti-waste work carried out since June, we have made preventing coal loss a major focus. According to the inspection at the end of June, the raw coal recovery rate in the first quarter of this year was 88.55 percent; in the second quarter, it was 91.3 percent, an increase of 2.75 percent compared to the first quarter. This shows that due to a series of measures we have taken, the work of preventing coal loss has achieved some results.

However, it should be admitted that the phenomenon of discarding raw coal still exists in our mine. Although the reasons are related to the influence of geological conditions, the main reason is that we still have shortcomings in technology and management. In addition, the consumption of pit props still exceeds the national standards. In order to further improve our work, we have decided to take three measures: abolish the advancing mining method, eliminate coal left at the top and bottom of the mining face, and clean up floating coal in the roadways, so that the raw coal recovery rate in the second half of the year will reach 92.16 percent, an increase of 4 percent compared to the annual plan.

Kaifeng Machinery Factory Improves Double-Share Plow Packaging Method

Editor:

After the "Reader's Letters" column published our letter criticizing the Kaifeng Machinery Factory for not improving the packaging method of double-share plows on March 13th, the leading comrades of relevant departments in Henan Province and the leading comrades of relevant units of the First Ministry of Machine Building who came to Henan to inspect work attached great importance to this issue. In addition to the Kaifeng Machinery Factory starting to improve the packaging method of double-share plows in April, the Anyang Machinery Factory and the Hunan Jianxiang Machinery Factory also adopted the new packaging method for delivery.

Due to the improvement of the double-share plow packaging method, the transportation loading capacity has been greatly improved. Before the improvement of the packaging, each 30-ton freight car could only load 80 plows on average; after the improvement, it can load 315 plows, reaching full load. According to calculations by the Kaifeng Railway Station, the double-share plows transported by the Kaifeng Machinery Factory to various places this year, after using the new packaging method, can save the country 373 railcars and save more than 82,000 yuan in freight. At the same time, it can also save a large number of automobile and horse-drawn carriage transportation capacity.

It should be noted that after the Kaifeng Machinery Factory improved the packaging of double-share plows, the packaging cost increased compared to before. However, this problem can be studied and improved. For example, the factory's packaging cost in the second quarter was more than 9 jiao 9 fen higher per unit than before the improvement, but it has been reduced to 5 jiao 5 fen in July; now the New Animal Power Agricultural Implements Promotion Department of the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is jointly studying with the Kaifeng Machinery Factory to reduce the packaging cost.

Public Security Academy Has Reduced the Cost of the Auditorium

Editor:

The criticism of Comrade Xiubin in the "Reader's Letters" column on May 22nd regarding the waste phenomenon in the construction of the auditorium of our academy is correct, and we sincerely accept it. When building the auditorium (i.e., the large classroom), our academy, due to its departmentalism and contamination by bourgeois ideology, violated the architectural principles of "suitability, economy, and attention to aesthetics where possible," and there were many extravagant and wasteful phenomena in the design.

After the newspaper's criticism and the inspection of relevant leading authorities, we actively corrected this mistake. Since this building started construction in October last year and had been built to the second floor by April this year, it was impossible to completely change the design. We reduced and modified the parts that could be reduced and modified as much as possible. We canceled the ethnic-style decorative patterns such as cement floral decorations, wooden floral canopies, que ti, dougong, and colored paint, reduced unnecessary equipment such as cloakrooms, small shops, parking lots, and flower beds, reduced the excessive number of outdoor pavements, overpasses, radiators, and wooden handrails in the original design, lowered the construction quality of the ground, steps, and lighting, and changed the methods of the roof, etc. As a result, a total of 106 items were reduced and modified, reducing the cost by more than 95,000 yuan.

In addition, we are determined to learn from this lesson, resolutely oppose extravagance and waste in all future work, and strive to implement the principle of thrift.

Kaifeng Municipal Bureau of Industry Begins to Handle Overstocked Materials in Various Factories

Editor:

After the "Reader's Letters" column published a letter criticizing the overstocked materials of various factories in Kaifeng City on July 24th, the Kaifeng Municipal Bureau of Industry organized the Municipal Planning Commission, Finance Bureau, Supervision Bureau, People's Bank and other units on July 28th to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the overstocked materials of various provincial, municipal, and public-private joint venture factories in the city. As of August 20th, according to the statistics of 17 units including the Kaifeng Machinery Factory, Henan Pharmaceutical Factory, Kaifeng Tobacco Factory, Kaifeng Winery, and Kaifeng Match Factory, there were more than 2,300 kinds of overstocked materials, with a value of more than 1.6 million yuan.

This inspection adopted the method of inspecting and handling at the same time. For example, the white sugar of the Kaifeng Winery had been overstocked for a long time, while the food factory was in great need of it, so it was decided to sell it to the food factory at that time; the motor of the Kaifeng Vegetable Oil Factory had been sold to the Henan Winery; the 1615 lathe of the Kaifeng Machinery Factory had been temporarily borrowed by the power plant for use; a total of 172 kinds of overstocked materials had been processed during the inspection, with a value of more than 88,000 yuan. At the same time, after research, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and other units divided the overstocked materials of various factories into three categories for processing: the first category was retained by the factory for self-use, the second category was sold to brother factories or relevant departments, and the third category was allocated by higher authorities. A meeting of the supply and marketing section chiefs of various factories was held on August 27th to balance and exchange information on overstocked materials and needed materials.

Solved the Bathing Problem for More Than 6,000 Employees

Editor:

The Party newspaper supported our opinion and criticized the relevant departments of the Ministry of Railways for not caring about the lives of the masses and raising the issue of bathing for more than 6,000 employees and their families in the second and third residential areas in the "Reader's Letters" column on February 13th this year, which aroused the attention of the leaders of the Ministry of Railways. Wang Zhijie, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, read this criticism to the people in charge of political work and trade union work throughout the railway at the National Political Work and Trade Union Work Conference in March this year, and expressed his support for this criticism. The Directly Subordinate Supply Section of the Ministry of Railways and the Trade Union of the Organs of the Ministry of Railways jointly studied the issue, and the supply section submitted a budget, which was approved by the leaders of the Ministry of Railways and allocated funds to repair the bathroom, and also added clothes storage cabinets, benches for rest, and water containers. This bathroom has been in use since June, which has basically solved the bathing problem for the vast number of employees and their families in the second and third residential areas of the Ministry of Railways. Employees and their families are very satisfied.

    接受群众批评，切实改进工作
    本溪煤矿提高了原煤回采率编辑同志：
    人民日报读者对我矿浪费原煤现象的批评，推动我们改进了工作。
    今年年初，我们已经开始注意了丢弃原煤等浪费现象，并且决定采取一些措施来加以纠正。四月二十四日“读者来信专页”发表了读者的批评信后，我们又进一步作了研究，在五月份专门检查这个问题，在六月份以来开展的反浪费工作中又把防止丢煤作为一项主要内容。根据六月末的检查，今年第一季度原煤回采率是百分之八十八点五五；第二季度是百分之九十一点三，比第一季度提高了百分之二点七五。这说明，由于我们采取了一系列的措施，防止丢煤的工作已经取得了一些成绩。
    但是，应该承认，目前丢弃原煤现象在我矿还是存在的。其原因虽然和地质条件的影响有关，但是主要的是我们在技术上和管理上还有着缺点。另外，坑木的消耗还是超过国家的标准。为了进一步改进工作，我们决定采取取消前进式采煤方法、消灭回采工作面顶底留煤和清扫巷道浮煤三项措施，使下半年原煤回采率达到百分之九十二点一六，比年计划提高百分之四。

    开封机械厂改进双铧犁包装法编辑同志：
      三月十三日“读者来信专页”发表了我们批评开封机械厂不改进双铧犁包装法的来信后，河南省有关部门的领导同志和第一机械工业部有关单位来河南检查工作的领导同志对这个问题都很重视。除了开封机械厂从四月份就开始改进双铧犁的包装方法以外，安阳机械厂和湖南建湘机械厂交货也都采用新法包装。
    由于双铧犁包装法的改进，运输装载量大大提高了。双铧犁在改进包装以前，每一个三十吨的货车平均只能装八十部；改进包装后可以装三百十五部，已经达到满载。根据开封车站计算，今年开封机械厂运往各地的双铧犁，用新法包装后，可为国家节约三百七十三个车皮，节约运费八万二千多元。同时，还可以节省大批汽车、马车的运输力。
    应该说明，开封机械厂在改进双铧犁包装后，包装费用比以前增高了。但是，这个问题是可以研究改进的。如这个厂第二季度包装费用比改进前每部高了九角九分多，七月份已减少到五角五分；现在河南省供销合作总社新式畜力农具推广部正和开封机械厂共同研究降低包装费用的办法。

    公安学院已经降低礼堂造价编辑同志：
      五月二十二日“读者来信专页”上秀彬同志对我院建筑礼堂中的浪费现象的批评是正确的，我们诚恳接受。我院在建筑礼堂（即大课堂）时，由于有本位主义思想，并且沾染了资产阶级思想，因而违反了“适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的建筑原则，在设计上出现了不少铺张浪费现象。
    经过报纸的批评和有关领导机关的检查，我们就积极纠正这个错误。由于这项建筑在去年十月份开始施工，到今年四月份时已经建造到二层，因此不可能全部变更设计。我们就对可以削减和修改的部分尽可能地作了削减和修改。我们取消了水泥花饰、木花罩、雀替、斗拱、彩色油漆等民族形式的装修花饰，削减了衣帽间、小卖部、停车场、花坛等不必要的设备，减少了原设计中数量过多的室外路面、天桥、暖气片、木扶手等设置，降低了地面、台阶、灯光等的建筑质量，改变了屋顶等的做法。结果共削减、修改了一百零六项，减少了造价九万五千多元。
    此外，我们还决心接受这个教训，在今后各项工作中坚决反对铺张浪费，努力贯彻节约的原则。

    开封市工业局开始处理各厂积压物资编辑同志：
    七月二十四日“读者来信专页”发表了批评开封市各工厂积压物资的来信后，开封市工业局在七月二十八日组织了市计划委员会、财政局、监察局、人民银行等单位对市内各省属、市属和公私合营厂的积压物资进行了全面的检查。到八月二十日为止，据开封机械厂、河南制药厂、开封烟厂、开封酒厂、开封火柴厂等十七个单位的统计，积压物资共二千三百多种，价值一百六十多万元。
    这次检查，采取了边检查边处理的办法。例如，开封酒厂的白糖积压了很久，而食品工厂却很需要，当时决定就转卖给食品工厂；开封植物油厂的马达已卖给河南酒厂；开封机械厂的一六一五车床已暂借给电厂使用；检查中已处理的积压物资共一百七十二种，价值八万八千多元。同时，市工业局等单位经过研究以后，又把各厂的积压物资分为三类进行处理：第一类留厂自用，第二类出卖给兄弟厂或有关部门，第三类由上级调拨。八月二十七日已经召开了各厂供销股长会议进行平衡，互相交流积压物资和需用物资的情况。

    解决了六千多职工的洗澡问题编辑同志：
    党报支持了我们的意见，在今年二月十三日的“读者来信专页”上对铁道部有关部门不关心群众生活，对第二、第三两个住宅区六千多职工及其家属的洗澡问题提出批评后，引起了铁道部领导方面的重视。中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席王志杰曾在今年三月全国政治工作、工会工作会议上向全路负责政治工作和工会工作的人员宣读了这篇批评稿件，并表示支持这一批评。铁道部直属供应段和铁道部机关工会共同进行了研究，由供应段提出预算，经铁道部领导方面批准后拨款修理浴室，还增设了存衣柜、休息用的板凳和供水容器等等。这个浴室已于六月份开始使用，基本上解决了铁道部第二、第三住宅区广大职工及其家属的洗澡问题。职工和家属都感到很满意。
