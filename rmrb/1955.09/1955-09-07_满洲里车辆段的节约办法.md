Manzhouli Rolling Stock Depot used to be the biggest waster in the Harbin Railway Bureau, with particularly serious waste in the use of materials. Some workers, when going out to repair vehicles, would always take more materials than needed, fearing they wouldn't have enough. When they were finished, they wouldn't bring the unused materials back. Inside and outside the factory, one could see brake shoes, screws, and all sorts of parts and scrap metal everywhere. Some were already corroded by mud and had become rusty waste. When repairing vehicles, some parts could still be used or slightly repaired, but the repairmen would throw them into the scrap heap as waste and replace them with new parts. In the first quarter of this year alone, the materials used for freight car repairs exceeded the quota by more than 62,000 yuan.

Recently, with the help of staff from the Harbin Railway Bureau, the depot has actively launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. They exposed and criticized the leadership's erroneous thinking of focusing only on production and neglecting conservation, as well as the serious waste phenomena. They inventoried the inventory materials of each unit, established material quota, storage, and usage systems, controlled the accumulation and waste of materials, and eliminated the chaos in material management.

They organized workers to rummage through the scrap piles and found more than 90 kinds of usable materials such as brake shoes, springs, and screws. They discovered and recovered 115 tons of discarded copper and iron, which had not been recorded and had been abandoned for many years, worth a total of 12,100 yuan.

They also implemented a system for appraising old materials. Every day at 3:00 PM, the appraisal team would appraise the parts removed from the repaired vehicles, distinguishing between usable parts and worthless waste materials, and immediately set prices for them and store them in the warehouse. In the past two months, more than 50 types and over 240 pieces of usable tools have been recovered through appraisal, worth more than 2,100 yuan, which can be used by the entire depot for half a year.

They also organized a vehicle inspection team to actively contact various inspection stations. Whenever there was a problem with machinery or transportation tools, the inspection team would take materials and repair tools there to repair them. This not only prolonged the life of the machinery but also avoided the phenomenon of discarding old materials randomly.

They paid special attention to saving valuable coal dust. They installed screens on the washing basins for the brake shoe beds, eliminating the waste of coal dust. The utilization rate of old coal dust has also increased compared to before. In June alone, of the 935 kilograms of coal dust used for hanging brake shoes, more than 735 kilograms were utilized old coal dust, saving the state more than 970 yuan.

Thanks to the efforts of all the staff, in June, the quota for repairing materials for each freight car passing through the station was reduced from an average of 0.17 yuan in April to 0.07 yuan, and the average quota for repairing materials for each freight car at the loading and unloading station was also reduced from 0.34 yuan in April to 0.11 yuan.

    满洲里车辆段的节约办法
    戴月
    满洲里车辆段过去是哈尔滨铁路管理局浪费最大的单位，在材料使用方面的浪费更突出。有的工人到外边去修理车辆时，恐怕材料不够用，总是多带一点出去，用不完时也不带回来。厂内厂外，到处都能看到闸瓦、螺丝钉等各种各样的零件和碎金属。有的已被泥土浸蚀，变成了腐锈的废料。在修理车辆时，有的零件本来还可以继续使用或稍加修理即可使用，但是修理人员也把它当成废品扔到废料堆里，重换新的零件。今年第一季度，仅货车的修理用料就超过定额六万二千多元。
    最近，该段在哈尔滨铁路管理局工作人员的帮助下，积极地展开了增产节约运动。他们揭发和批判了领导人员只顾生产不顾节约的错误思想和严重的浪费现象，清查了各单位的库存材料，建立了材料定额、保管、使用等项制度，控制了材料的积压和浪费，消灭了材料管理上的紊乱现象。
    他们组织职工在废料堆中翻出了能用的闸瓦、弹簧、螺丝钉等材料九十多种，发现和回收了没有记账的被弃多年的废铜、废铁一百一十五吨，合计价值一万二千一百多元。
    他们还实行了旧料鉴定制度。每天下午三点钟，鉴定小组就对修车卸下来的零件作一次鉴定，把可以使用的和失去使用价值的废料区分开，并当即定出价格，存入仓库。两个月来，经过鉴定回收的可用的工具就有五十多种、二百四十多件，价值两千一百多元，可供全段半年使用。
    他们还组织了车辆检查小组，主动同各检所联系。遇到哪里的机器或交通工具发生了问题，检查小组就携带材料和修理工具到那里去补修。这样，既延长了机器的寿命，也避免了乱扔旧料的现象。
    他们特别注意节约贵重的乌金。他们在挂瓦床的洗瓦案子上装上了纱罩，消灭了浪费乌金的现象。旧乌金的使用率也较前提高。仅在六月份挂瓦用的九百三十五公斤乌金中，就有七百三十五公斤多是利用的旧乌金，给国家节约了九百七十多元。
    由于全段职工的努力，六月份每辆货车在通过站修理材料的定额已由四月份的平均一角七分降低到七分，在装卸站平均每辆的修理材料定额也由四月份的三角四分降低到一角一分。
