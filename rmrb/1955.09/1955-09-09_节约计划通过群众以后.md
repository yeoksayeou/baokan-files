    After the Savings Plan is Approved by the Masses
    By Our Reporter Gu Lei
    The entire process of the state-owned Shanghai Bicycle Factory carrying out comprehensive savings work proves that only by facing the masses, relying on the masses at every step, and giving full play to the wisdom of the masses can we formulate advanced savings targets and find ways to complete savings tasks.
    The production of the Bicycle Factory has developed in recent years. Compared with 1953, the output in 1955 increased from 60,000 bicycles to 142,000 bicycles. It is regrettable that the quality of the bicycles is very poor: the welding is not strong, and there are fractures; the electroplating rusts quickly; the paint peels off easily; and some parts wear out quickly. People who bought the bicycles have made suggestions to the Bicycle Factory, saying that "the Forever brand bicycle is not forever." Later, although the quality of the bicycles has been greatly improved, well-meaning users still raised many suggestions, from the style of the bicycle to the safety devices, from the sturdiness of the saddle to the quality of the pedals, from the length of the frame to the width of the handlebars...
    The poor quality and style of the bicycles are related to the chaotic technical management of the factory. Taking the inspection work as an example, until the second quarter of 1955, only the "completion inspection" system could be implemented, and other inspection systems were mostly in name only. The inspection methods were also mostly primitive. When inspectors carried out drying inspections, they did not use instruments to control the temperature, but used their eyes. The workers operating would spit on the parts! The drawings for processing parts were not uniform, and the same type of parts on the same bicycle could not be interchanged. Some parts had to be knocked, filed, ground, and scraped to "fit" during assembly.
    Therefore, improving product quality has become an important task for the Bicycle Factory. After the nationwide savings campaign was launched, the Bicycle Factory, in accordance with the requirements of the state and the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, determined that improving quality and reducing costs were the focus of savings. At this time, the state gave the Bicycle Factory a cost target of reducing the cost of each bicycle by 11.73% compared to 1954. However, because it was necessary to improve the quality and style of the bicycles, money was needed, and this money was not included in this year's actual costs. Of course, if the Bicycle Factory ignored the opinions of the masses and did not improve the quality and style of the bicycles, it could easily obtain the honor of "overfulfilling the savings plan." However, this practice of sacrificing the interests of consumers is incompatible with the nature of socialist enterprises. The Bicycle Factory rejected this approach. After research, they decided to take the following measures to improve the quality of the bicycles and improve the style of the bicycles: increase the small springs in the saddle, lengthen the body, widen the handlebars, thicken the electroplating, add a cover to the chain, improve the braking device, use high-quality steel instead of ordinary steel to process certain important parts, and add reflective glass to the rear of the bicycle. Implementing these measures would cost several yuan more per bicycle. In this way, the state's target would not be achieved.
    At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on practicing economy, called on all enterprises to calculate detailed accounts, take stock, and formulate practical savings plans. In order to implement this instruction, the Bicycle Factory initially mobilized the staff of the departments to calculate detailed accounts. The calculation results were: the actual costs in the first quarter and the second quarter were close to the state's required target, and only the several yuan needed to improve the quality of the bicycles were not covered. The department staff had exposed certain wastes in raw materials, auxiliary materials, tools, administrative management fees, etc., and put forward 86 measures. But after calculating back and forth, the resulting numbers were still far from the state's required target, and they could not think of any other way. At this time, the mood of the leading staff and the department staff was not high, and the leading staff of the factory also reported these situations to the First Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, whose real motivation was to lower the savings target. Because the bureau did not agree, it was abandoned. At this time, the situation of savings in the factory was: how the above arranged, how the factory did it; the leaders had no idea in their minds, lacked confidence, and the plan floated in the air. The only reason for this was that the leading staff did not have enough determination to overcome difficulties, and the savings activities were divorced from the worker masses.
    The First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of our country, which was adopted by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, greatly encouraged the staff of the entire factory. At this time, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China continued to mobilize all enterprises and institutions in Shanghai to repeatedly calculate detailed accounts and fight against various conservative ideas. The Bicycle Factory Committee of the Communist Party of China organized the staff of the entire factory to further discuss savings work, criticized the conservative and unenthusiastic practices of tapping potential, and decided to fully mobilize the masses and resolutely complete the state's savings target. Afterwards, a waste exhibition was held in the factory. The examples at the exhibition pointed out that from the beginning of last year to May of this year, the losses from waste product returns and repairs amounted to more than 258,000 yuan, and the accumulated materials amounted to 132,000 yuan; most of these losses were caused by unsound systems, lax inspections, lack of a sense of responsibility, and carelessness in work. If the staff of the entire factory could establish socialist management thinking, cherish every bit of the state's wealth, many losses could be avoided.
    The exhibition gave all the staff a very practical education. On this basis, several leaders of the factory went deep into the departments to understand the situation and further discovered various kinds of waste. A rough calculation showed that more than 3,000 yuan could be reduced each month just from furniture repair fees, office expenses, and domestic water and electricity charges. Because the patterns on the sprockets were not uniform, the "stamped" materials were all sold as scrap steel, but these scrap materials could have been used to make small parts. There was also a great deal of waste in the use of auxiliary materials such as copper, grinding wheels, cloth wheels, nickel plates, paint, and machine oil. In short, in the past, there was: chaotic planning, random spending, random buying, and random use.
    Based on the materials already available, the leading staff of the factory held various small-scale symposiums separately, using the method of item-by-item verification to tap the potential for savings. It was discovered that if the sprockets were thinned and the style of the middle pattern was changed under the condition of ensuring quality, and the good materials stamped out were fully utilized, 13 tons of steel could be saved in the second half of the year; management fees could also be reduced by 14,000 yuan. After these tasks, the leaders had a better understanding of the situation, and they convened a conference of cadres above the level of foreman in the entire factory. At the meeting, the situation that had been discovered was presented in public, explaining that the factory had great potential, pointing out the key points of savings in each workshop and department, and letting the attendees discuss. At this meeting, everyone put forward 47 more measures. But after the final calculation, the state's required target was still not reached. Moreover, these measures had not yet met the workers, and a reliable guarantee for completing the measures had not yet been found.
    In order to solve this problem, the Bicycle Factory convened a meeting of employee representatives. In addition to reporting on the work of the second quarter to the delegates and arranging the work for the second half of the year and the third quarter, the savings target and various measures were handed over to the representatives for discussion. At the meeting, the representatives discussed and went deep into the workshops to consult directly with the workers, forming a determination in the entire factory: to strive to improve product quality and make the cost of each bicycle reach the state's target! The broad masses of workers actively thought of ways and put forward measures, not only making the content of the original 133 measures more specific, but also putting forward 93 workshop measures in each workshop.
    The methods proposed by the workers were very specific. For example, the diameter of the cloth wheels used for polishing is 18 inches. In the past, they were scrapped when they were used to 14 inches. Now, some can be used until only 7 inches are left; the nickel plates used for electroplating used to have the cut-off ends thrown away, which had been accumulated for two years without being utilized. Now, not only are they all utilized, but it is also guaranteed that no plate edges will be lost in the future; using soda water instead of some machine oil for some machines, the two rolling beds in the pedal group alone can save more than 2,150 yuan each year, and the flywheel, parts, and foot pedal groups in the fourth workshop can save 7,153 yuan in oil each year; using various methods to save steel, 100 tons can be saved in the second half of the year. The methods proposed by the workers enriched the original measures and provided a reliable guarantee for the savings plan. According to preliminary calculations, the state's target has been successfully exceeded. The work of practicing economy has reached a climax, and new savings methods are constantly emerging.
    In order to turn these measures into organized actions, the leaders of the Bicycle Factory classified and sorted out each measure (excluding workshop measures, a total of 153 measures), incorporated it into the production plan, and issued specific targets to the workshops. The savings work of the Bicycle Factory was only then on the right track. Among the measures, 27 are for improving quality, 15 are for improving enterprise management, and 98 are for reducing costs; there are also other measures for improving labor protection, improving technological processes, accelerating capital turnover, and improving cultural and technical levels. These measures are not only practical and feasible, but also can promote the management work of the entire enterprise. In order to further guarantee the realization of these measures, the Bicycle Factory also formulated a method for regularly inspecting savings work: according to the different nature of the measures, dividing which ones are the responsibility of which department to implement, which department is to cooperate, when to complete, and who is responsible for the inspection; every Wednesday, the entire factory carries out various savings activities, and the staff of the factory department, each department, and each workshop use the morning study time to check the completion of various measures; the factory department convenes workshop staff in the morning to report on problems in production, and the factory affairs meeting is held in the afternoon to study ways to solve the current problems; workers use their spare time in the evening to check their own work and put forward the guarantee plan for the next week. In this way, various problems in savings work can be solved in a timely manner, and new savings methods can be absorbed in a timely manner to enrich the savings plan, ensuring that this work develops smoothly. As of August 27, the measures that have been completed in the entire factory account for 19.5%; other measures are being implemented. By the end of the year, not only can the production plan be completed, but also the savings target can be completed, product quality can be improved, and the needs of the broad masses of consumers can be met. This is the entire harvest of the Bicycle Factory relying on the masses to practice economy.

### 节约计划通过群众以后

    节约计划通过群众以后
    本报记者  顾雷
    国营上海自行车厂开展全面节约工作的整个过程证明：只有面向群众、步步依靠群众、发挥群众的智慧，才能订出先进的节约指标，找出完成节约任务的办法。
    自行车厂几年来生产有发展，一九五五年同一九五三年比，产量由六万辆增加到十四万二千辆。令人遗憾的是车子的质量很不好：焊接得不牢，有断裂现象；电镀的地方很快生了锈；油漆容易脱落；部分零件很快就磨坏了。买车子的人曾给自行车厂提过意见，说“永久牌自行车不永久”。后来，车子的质量虽有很大改进，好心的用户们还是由车子的式样到保安装置、由坐垫的牢固到脚踏的质量、由车架的长短到车把的宽窄……提出许多意见。
    车子的质量和式样不好，同这个厂的技术管理混乱有关。单以检查工作看，直到一九五五年第二季度以前，只有“完工检查”一个制度能够贯彻，其他检查制度多流于形式。检查的方法也多是原始的，检查人员进行烘干检查时，不是用仪表控制温度，而是用眼睛，操作的工人是向部件上吐唾沫！加工部件的图纸不统一，同一部车子上的同一类部件不能互换，部分零件装配时要经过敲、锉、磨、刮才能“入座”。
    因此，提高产品质量，成了自行车厂的一项重要任务。全国开展节约工作后，自行车厂根据国家的要求和中共上海市委会的指示，确定以提高质量、降低成本为节约的重点。这时，国家给自行车厂的成本指标是每辆车的成本要比一九五四年降低百分之十一点七三。但是，因为要改进车子的质量和式样，需要花钱，而这笔钱并没有计算在今年的实际成本之内。当然，自行车厂如果不管群众的意见，不改进质量和车子的式样，是可以轻巧地取得“超额完成节约计划”的荣誉的。但这种牺牲消费者的利益的做法，是同社会主义企业的性质不相容的。自行车厂排斥了这种做法。经过研究，他们决定采取下列一些措施来提高车子的质量、改进车子的样式：增加坐垫小弹簧、伸长车身、放宽把手、电镀加厚、链子带罩、改进刹车装置、用优质钢代替普通钢加工某些重要零件、车后添反光玻璃。实现这些措施，每辆车子的成本要多好几元。这样，就达不到国家的指标。
    当时，中共上海市委员会根据中共中央关于厉行节约的指示，号召所有企业通过算细账、摸底、制定切实的节约计划。为贯彻这一指示，自行车厂初步发动科室人员算细账。计算结果是：第一季度和第二季度的实际成本接近国家要求的指标，只有改进车子质量要花的几元钱没有着落。科室人员曾揭发了原材料、辅助材料、工具、行政管理费等方面的某些浪费，提出了八十六条措施。但算来算去，得出的数字同国家要求的指标还相差很远，再也想不出别的办法了。这时，领导工作人员和科室工作人员的情绪都不高，厂的领导工作人员还将这些情况向第一机械工业部第一机器工业管理局报告，其真实的动机是想降低节约指标。因为局里没有答应，才作罢。这时，全厂节约的情况是：上面怎样布置，厂里怎样搞；领导心中无数，信心不足，计划飘在空中。追其原因，只有一个：领导工作人员克服困难的决心不够，节约的活动脱离工人群众。
    第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过的我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，大大鼓舞了全厂的工作人员。这时，中共上海市委继续动员上海市所有企业单位反复算细账，向各种保守思想进行斗争。中共自行车厂委员会组织全厂工作人员进一步讨论了节约工作，批判了保守、不积极挖掘潜力的做法，决定全力发动群众，坚决完成国家节约的指标。之后，在厂内举行了废品展览会，会上的实例指出：自去年年初到今年五月，废品退修的损失达二十五万八千多元，积压物资十三万二千元；这些损失绝大部分是因为制度不周、检查不严、责任心不强、工作中粗枝大叶所造成。如果全厂工作人员能树立社会主义的经营思想，爱护国家一点一滴的财富，有许多损失是可以避免的。
    展览会给全体人员一个很实际的教育。在这个基础上，厂的几个领导人员又深入各科摸情况，进一步发现了各种各样的浪费。粗略计算一下，只是家具修理费、办公费、生活用水和电费每月即可减掉三千多元。由于牙盘上花纹的式样不统一，“冲”下来的料都作废钢出卖了，而这些废料本来可以用做小的部件。在使用铜、砂轮、布轮、镍板、油漆、机油等辅助材料方面也有很大的浪费。总之，过去是：乱计划、乱发钱、乱买、乱用。
    根据已掌握的材料，厂的领导工作人员又分头召开各种小型的座谈会，用逐笔核对的办法挖掘节约的潜力。发现如在保证质量的条件下把牙盘改薄、改变中间花纹的式样，充分利用冲下的好料，下半年就能节省十三吨钢材；管理费也可核减一万四千元。经过这些工作，领导工作人员的心里更有数了，便召开全厂工长以上的干部大会。会上，把摸到的情况当众摆出，说明厂里有很大的潜力，指出各车间、各科节约的重点，让到会的人讨论。在这次会上，大家又提出四十七条措施。但是最后计算一下，仍然达不到国家要求的指标。而且这些措施还没有同工人见面，还没有找出完成措施的可靠保证。
    为了解决这个问题，自行车厂又召开了职工代表会议，除向大会代表报告第二季度工作，布置下半年和第三季度的工作外，并把节约的指标和各项措施交给代表讨论。会上，代表们一面进行讨论，一面深入车间和工人直接商量，全厂内形成一个决心：为提高产品质量，使每辆车的成本达到国家指标而奋斗！广大工人群众都积极地想办法、提措施，不但原有的一百三十三条措施的内容更具体了，而且各车间又提出了车间的措施九十三条。
    工人们提出的办法都很具体。例如：打光用的布轮的直径是十八寸，过去用到十四寸就报废，现在有些可以用到只剩下七寸；电镀用的镍板，过去把裁下的头子扔掉，积压了两年没有利用，现在不但全部加以利用，而且保证今后不丢掉一点板边；用苏打水代替部分机器的机油，只是脚踏组两部滚床每年就可节省二千一百五十多元，四车间飞轮、零件、踏脚三个组每年可节省油类七千一百五十三元；利用各种办法节约钢材，下半年可省下一百吨。工人们提出的办法丰富了原来的措施，使节约计划获得可靠的保证。据初步计算，已顺利地超过了国家提出的指标。厉行节约的工作走向了高潮，而且不断出现新的节约办法。
    为了把这些措施变成有组织的行动，自行车厂的领导人员又分类归纳和整理了每一项措施，（车间措施不在内，总计一百五十三条，）把它纳入了生产计划，订出具体的指标下达车间。自行车厂的节约工作到这时才走上正常的轨道。在措施中，有二十七条是提高质量的，十五条是改进企业管理的，九十八条是降低成本的；其他还有改进劳动保护、改进工艺过程、加速资金周转、提高文化技术水平等措施。这些措施不但切实可行，而且能推动整个企业的管理工作。为了进一步保证实现这些措施，自行车厂还订出经常检查节约工作的办法：根据不同性质的措施，划分那一些由那个部门负责贯彻、那个部门配合、什么时候完成、谁负责检查；每星期三全厂进行各种节约活动，厂部、各科室、各车间人员利用早晨学习时间检查各项措施完成情况；厂部在上午召集车间人员汇报生产中的问题，下午开厂务会议研究解决目前问题的办法；工人利用晚上的业余时间检查自己的工作和提出下一周的保证计划。这样，就能够及时解决节约工作中的各种问题，也可以及时吸收新的节约办法充实节约计划，保证这一工作顺利向前发展。到八月二十七日为止，全厂已完成的措施占百分之十九点五；其他措施正在执行中。到年底，不但可以完成生产计划，而且可以完成节约指标，提高产品质量，满足广大消费者的要求。这就是自行车厂依靠群众厉行节约的全部收获。
