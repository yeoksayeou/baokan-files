Xinhua News Agency, September 6th. The youth in various industrial, mining, basic construction, and transportation departments throughout the country have been using their spare time to collect a large amount of scrap steel and abandoned materials.

According to incomplete statistics from seventeen provinces and cities including Liaoning, Shanxi, Henan, Zhejiang, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, 6,283 youth conservation teams consisting of over 314,000 young workers participated in activities to collect scrap steel and abandoned materials. They have recovered over 90,600 tons of scrap steel, 967 tons of non-ferrous metals, and over 560,000 pieces of various machine parts, tools, and equipment for the country. In Liaoning Province, 150,000 young workers participated in the activity of collecting abandoned materials. In addition to recovering 80,684 tons of scrap steel and 130,000 pieces (plus 11 tons) of tools and parts, they also recovered a large amount of timber, coal, ore, coke, electrical wire, red bricks, sea salt, etc. In Tianjin, over 33,000 young conservation team members, in just three months, recovered scrap metal, waste materials, and various tools and parts, the value of which can be calculated at 960,000 yuan. Many factories and construction sites have set up youth conservation boxes and youth conservation warehouses, where young conservation team members send the materials they collect at any time.

In the activity of recovering waste materials, many young workers, while ensuring quality, have tried their best to directly use the recovered materials in production. The young workers of the Andong Dyeing and Weaving Factory used the recovered parts to make a "Youth Model" dyeing machine. The Li Hongsheng forging team of the Benxi branch of the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Engineering Company used the recovered materials to manufacture a small baking oven and made thousands of parts from four tons of scrap steel. Of the twelve kinds of workpieces processed by the forging youth conservation team of the Qiqihar Railway Vehicle Manufacturing Plant from January to May this year, seven kinds were made from leftover materials, saving 8,640 kilograms of steel and creating a wealth of 10,920 yuan for the country.

    广大青年职工积极拣收废钢铁和遗弃材料
    据新华社六日讯　全国各工矿企业、基本建设、交通运输部门的青年，利用业余时间拣收了许多废钢铁和遗弃材料。
    据辽宁、山西、河南、浙江、北京、天津、上海等十七个省、市的不完全统计，有六千二百八十三个青年节约队的三十一万四千多名青年职工，参加了拣收废钢铁、遗弃材料的活动；他们已为国家回收了废钢铁九万零六百多吨，有色金属九百六十七吨，各种机器零件、工具、器材五十六万多件。辽宁全省有十五万青年职工参加拣收遗弃材料的活动，除了拣回废钢铁八万零六百八十四吨，工具零件十三万件又十一吨外，还回收了大量的木材、煤、矿石、焦炭、电线、红砖、海盐等。天津市三万三千多名青年节约队员，在短短的三个月中，拣回的废金属、废料和各种工具、零件，仅能计算价值的，就有九十六万元。许多工厂和建筑工地上，都设立了青年节约箱和青年节约仓库，青年节约队员们随时把拣得的物资送到那里去。
    在回收废料的活动中，许多青年工人还在保证质量的情况下，把回收材料尽量地直接运用到生产中去。安东染织厂的青年工人将回收的零件制成一台青年号染机。鞍钢建设工程公司本溪分公司李鸿升锻工小组利用回收的材料制造了一台小烘炉，并将四吨废钢铁制成几千件零件。齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂锻工青年节约小组，在今年一月到五月加工的十二种工作物中，有七种是利用残料做成的，节约了八千六百四十公斤钢铁，为国家创造了一万零九百二十元的财富。
