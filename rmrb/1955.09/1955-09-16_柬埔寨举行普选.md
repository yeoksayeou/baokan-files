Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 14th: Phnom Penh dispatch: The general election in Cambodia was held on September 11th. According to Cambodian officials, only slightly more than 50% of the voters participated in the voting. The remaining approximately 500,000 voters "abstained." On the day of the voting, the Royal Cambodian Government dispatched police to surround and close the central organs of the Democratic Party, and arrested Wen Wanxi, the Deputy Secretary of the Democratic Party. Other leaders of the Democratic Party had to go into hiding to avoid persecution.

According to disclosures from the Democratic Party, on that day the police carried out "particularly severe" "surveillance" of the polling stations. In certain provinces, there were not even registers to record votes cast for the opposition parties. Despite this, according to the figures already released, out of 500,000 votes, 100,000 votes were still cast for the opposition parties. However, according to the election results, all ninety-one seats in the National Assembly were monopolized by the People's Socialist Community, formerly headed by King Sihanouk.

The message says that on the eve of the general election, at a meeting organized by the Democratic Party in Phnom Penh, members of the People's Socialist Community beat up members of the Democratic Party, and the police also opened fire and arrested people at the meeting. As early as during the campaign activities, many candidates and propagandists from the People's Party and the Democratic Party and other democratic parties were subjected to intimidation, restrictions, and arrest. Voters were also warned by government officials, village chiefs, police, and landlords, threatening them not to vote for parties other than the People's Socialist Community.

According to the United Press, the opposition parties, especially the Democratic Party, accused the election of being fraudulent and complained to the International Commission about illegal acts in the election.

    柬埔寨举行普选
    新华社河内十四日电　金边消息：柬埔寨的普选九月十一日举行。据柬埔寨官员说，只有百分之五十多一点的选民参加了投票。其余约五十万选民“弃权”。在投票的当天，柬埔寨王国政府出动了警察包围和封闭了民主党的中央机构，逮捕了民主党的副书记文湾西克。民主党的其他领导人为了避免迫害而不得不隐蔽起来。
    据民主党方面揭露，当天警察对各投票站进行了“格外厉害的”“监察”。在某几个省内，甚至没有表册来记录投给反对党的票。虽然如此，据已经公布的数字，在五十万张选票中，仍然有十万张选票是投给反对党的。但是，选举结果，国民议会所有九十一个议席却全部为以前国王西哈努克为首的人民社会同盟所独占。
    消息说，在普选进行的前夕，在金边的民主党组织的一个集会上，人民社会同盟的人殴打了民主党人，警察也开枪并且逮捕了集会的人。早在进行竞选活动时，人民派和民主党等民主党派的许多候选人和宣传员就遭到恫吓、限制和逮捕。选民们也受到政府官吏、里乡长、警察和地主的警告，威胁他们不得投人民社会同盟以外的其他党派的票。
    据合众社报道，反对党，特别是民主党指责选举有欺骗行为，并且向国际委员会控诉在选举中有违法行为。
