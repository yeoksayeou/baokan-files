    Support the Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns
    From Unified Purchase and Sale to Rationed Supply
    Jian Hong
    Since the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, the people in the cities have truly felt three major benefits from their own experience: First, they no longer have to worry about not being able to buy grain; second, they are not afraid of soaring grain prices; and third, they are no longer subject to the various exploitations and deceptions of unscrupulous merchants.
    People in every city, especially the working people, show a sense of joy whenever they talk about the current grain supply situation. They deeply feel that since liberation, especially since the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, they have been spared so much suffering and disaster regarding the issue of eating.
    Before liberation, the people of many cities not only suffered the pain of hunger and death during the Japanese imperialist occupation, but also suffered cruel oppression and exploitation during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. People still shudder when they recall the tragic situation of six or seven years ago. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary rulers and unscrupulous merchants controlled the grain, stirring up trouble all day long, hoarding and raising prices to seek exorbitant profits. In severe cases, grain prices soared several times a day. A rickshaw puller in Fuzhou said that the money he earned from taking a passenger from the suburbs to the city could only buy twelve taels or half a catty of rice. Lin Zhumei, a worker's family member in Fuzhou, painfully recalled the situation before liberation – in April and May of 1949: "The money my husband earned from working twelve hours a day became worthless overnight; sometimes, in the time it took to cook a meal or wash a piece of clothing for the children, the money that could have bought a little rice could buy nothing at all." At that time, people in Fuzhou generally felt that grain was more expensive than gold, and rice sold for as much as five silver dollars per liter at its most expensive. Even in Wuxi, a prosperous grain-producing area and a grain distribution center, people suffered the same hunger. Wuxi is one of the four famous rice markets in the country. Before liberation, in 1948, due to runaway inflation, people valued goods more than money, and this rice market became a stronghold for capitalists to speculate and profiteer. At that time, the city handled five to six million piculs of grain annually, but there were more than 50,000 people in the city who lacked grain. The severely exploited citizens cursed these speculative merchants as "rice weevils" and called the market with constantly changing grain prices at that time as "the three-market turnaround." Anqing, in Anhui Province, is a major grain distribution center in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In 1947, several well-known merchants in the city colluded to hoard grain and refuse to sell it, creating an artificial grain shortage. At that time, citizens, workers, and students not only suffered the pain of hunger, but also suffered bloodshed in the anti-hunger struggle. The grain shortages in some large cities were even more severe at that time. Residents in Shanghai often lined up in "long snake formations" of four to five thousand people or more in front of each rice shop to buy millet; dozens of people were crushed and injured in Ximen Road, Danjing Temple, and Jade Buddha Temple in one day. Some citizens often squatted there overnight wrapped in quilts just to buy some grain. Even with such hard work, they often could not buy any grain. Not only was grain expensive and difficult to buy at that time, but the weight was insufficient, the quality was very poor, it was mixed with sand and water, and it was moldy and inedible.
    After liberation, unscrupulous merchants continued to exploit every opportunity to speculate in grain. In June and July of 1949, unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai heard some news of floods and took the opportunity to raise grain prices. The market price of Zhongbai Japonica rice rose from 4,700 yuan to 75,000 yuan (old currency) per picul, a fifteen-fold increase in a month and a half. Unscrupulous merchants also bought over a large number of bad elements to purchase and squeeze out the state's grain everywhere, forcing many laborers who ate and bought in small quantities to reluctantly buy grain from private merchants at prices higher than the listed price because they often could not buy grain from cooperatives. Before Shanghai implemented unified grain sales at the end of 1953, the selling price of each dan of rice in private rice shops was 1,000 yuan (old currency) higher than that of state-owned companies. After private grain shops were converted into consignment shops after the implementation of unified grain sales, the six million citizens of Shanghai avoided this exploitation of about 800 million yuan (old currency) per month from private merchants.
    Since the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, because the state has guaranteed the people's reasonable supply and abolished the intermediate exploitation of grain merchants, people believe that the "grain price that even gods cannot determine" has been stabilized. Urban people can buy reasonably priced and high-quality grain, and they no longer have to worry about not being able to buy grain and unstable grain prices. A metal worker in Guangzhou who had been forced to give away his child due to hunger, because of stable grain prices and the elimination of exploitation by unscrupulous merchants, his family can not only eat enough, but also their lives have greatly improved, and they no longer worry about the problem of eating. Lu Fengchen, a worker at the Baoding Flour Mill in Hebei Province, said: After grain prices stabilized, because the workers no longer worry about the problem of eating at home, they can work with peace of mind, and the factory's output increased by 12.1 percent from the unified purchase and sale of grain to November 1954. Many urban residents said with satisfaction: In the past, there was often no rice in the pot, but now it is not too late to buy rice after the water is boiled; in the past, adults were often deceived when buying rice, but now it is not necessary to worry about letting children buy it. In the past few months when Wuhan and Anqing were surrounded by floods last year, not only were grain prices stable and supply as usual, but state-owned grain stores and cooperatives in the city also sent people to deliver grain to the residents who were flooded. Many of the original grain stores and rice processing plants in Chongqing were concentrated in the densely populated downtown area. After the city developed to the suburbs after liberation, there were very few grain stores in many new urban areas, especially in the areas where the working people lived, and some suburbs even had no grain stores, and it was very inconvenient for residents to buy grain. After the implementation of unified grain sales, the Grain Administration formed a city-wide grain supply network according to the region, population, and the habits of citizens buying grain. The consignment shops and rice processing plants concentrated in one place were appropriately relocated with the assistance of the government. Now it is much more convenient for residents to buy rice than before. When it comes to the New Year holidays, state-owned grain stores, cooperatives, and consignment shops also prepare a large amount of glutinous rice, millet, red beans, etc. according to the living habits of the citizens, and try their best to meet people's requirements. This situation is the same in every city.
    The above-mentioned benefits are only the visible material benefits that the urban people have obtained at present. We must also see the greater long-term interests of the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain for the urban people and the people of the whole country. This is mainly reflected in the fact that it guarantees the needs of socialist construction and is conducive to the progress of socialist construction. It must be understood that only by realizing socialist construction and developing industrial and agricultural production can the material and cultural life of all the people be continuously improved, and urban residents can live a happy life. After the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, the needs of industrial construction have been fully guaranteed, the development of industrial production has been promoted, and the restrictions, transformation and utilization of urban and rural capitalism have been greatly strengthened. All grain merchants and rice shops in various cities have quickly been incorporated into the track of state capitalism, and have changed from the capitalist business methods of "speculation and profit-seeking" to consignment shops serving the grain supply work for urban people; at the same time, the connection between urban and rural capitalism has been cut off from the grain aspect, weakening the influence of capitalism on farmers, and fatally hitting and restricting the grain speculation behavior of rich peasants. Moreover, due to the unified purchase and sale of grain, the economic alliance between the working class and the peasants has been further strengthened. On the one hand, the peasants sell grain to the state, and on the other hand, they rely on state-owned stores, cooperatives and the markets they lead to supply the means of production and means of subsistence. In this way, not only the circulation of industrial and agricultural products is accelerated, avoiding intermediate exploitation; and because of the strengthening of the leadership of the socialist economy, various economic tasks in rural areas have been promoted, and the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production have also been greatly promoted. At present, our country's grain is enough to eat and use, but it is not abundant. If we want to fundamentally change this situation and greatly increase the production of grain and other agricultural products, it is only possible to gradually realize agricultural collectivization. The fact that the collectivization movement can develop vigorously in the countryside, the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in the countryside, is one of the main reasons for this situation.
    The Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns recently announced by the State Council further strengthens the work of unified grain sales in cities and towns. This is precisely to consolidate the current personal interests that the people in cities and towns have already obtained, and at the same time to ensure the realization of greater long-term interests for all urban and rural people. Therefore, the people in cities and towns should deeply understand this truth. Those who understand this truth should patiently persuade those who have ideological problems or do not understand thoroughly, so that they can understand the implementation of the measures for rationed grain supply in cities and towns for their own personal and long-term interests. At the same time, they should also understand that the implementation of this measure is only unfavorable to those who want to take advantage of loopholes to speculate in grain. Only when everyone understands these truths clearly, and is always vigilant and exposes the rumors and sabotage of counter-revolutionaries and bad people, can this method be smoothly implemented, and can they consolidate their current gains and ensure the realization of greater long-term interests.

    拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法
    从统购统销到定量供应
    剑虹
    粮食统购统销以来，城市人民从切身体验中，真正感到了三大好处：一、不用担心买不到粮食了；二、不怕粮价高涨了；三、不再受奸商们的种种剥削和欺骗了。
    各个城市的人民，特别是劳动人民，只要一谈起目前粮食供应情形，就会流露出一种喜悦的心情。他们深深感到，解放以来，特别是实行粮食统购统销以来，真不知在吃饭问题上免除了多少痛苦和灾难。
    解放前，许多城市的人民不仅在日本帝国主义侵占时期饱受了饥饿死亡的痛苦，在国民党反动统治时期也遭受了残酷的压榨、剥削。人们想起六、七年前的悲惨状况，现在还不寒而栗。那时，国民党反动统治者和奸商们控制了粮食，整天兴风作浪，囤积抬价，谋取暴利，严重时粮价一天飞涨几次。福州市的三轮工人说，从市郊拿到可以买一斤米的车钱，跑到城里就只能买十二两或半斤了。福州市工人家属林珠妹沉痛地回忆解放前——一九四九年四、五月间的情景说：“我丈夫一天做了十二个钟头的工，拿回的钱，过一宿就变成了废纸；有时，只隔煮一顿饭或给小孩洗一件衣服的时间，本来可以买一点米的钱，一点也买不到了。”那时，福州市的人们普遍感到粮食比金子贵，大米最贵时每升卖到五块银元。就是在富饶的产粮区的粮食集散地——无锡市，人们也同样遭受着饥饿的痛苦。无锡市是全国著名的四大米市之一，在解放前一九四八年，因通货恶性膨胀，人心重物轻币，这个米市便成了资本家们投机倒把的堡垒。那时，全市每年吞吐的粮食达五、六百万石，但全市的缺粮人口就有五万多人。被残酷剥削的市民们骂这些投机倒把的商人为“米蛀虫”，称那时粮价变化无常的市场为“回头三市”。安徽省的安庆市是长江下游主要的粮食集散地。一九四七年该市几个有名的大商人勾结起来囤粮不卖，造成了人为的粮荒。当时的市民、工人、学生不仅遭受了饥饿的痛苦，而且在反饥饿斗争中造成了流血事件。那时一些大城市的粮荒更是严重。上海的居民们为了抢购黄米，在每个米店的门口，经常排着四、五千人以上的“长蛇阵”；在西门路、淡井庙、玉佛寺一天之内曾经挤死挤伤好几十人。有些市民为了买点粮食，常常是披了被子整夜地蹲在那里排队。就是这样辛苦，也往往买不到一点粮食。那时的粮食不仅又贵又难买，而且分量不足，质量很坏，掺沙掺水，霉坏得不堪食用。
    解放后，奸商们仍然利用每个空隙进行粮食投机。一九四九年六、七月间，上海市的奸商们听到一些水灾的消息，就趁机抬高粮价，中白粳的市价，从每石四千七百元涨到七万五千元（旧币），一个半月中涨了十五倍。奸商们并收买大批坏分子到处抢购、挤购国家的粮食，逼得许多零吃零买的劳动人民，常常因为买不到合作社的粮食而忍痛向私商购买高于牌价的粮食。一九五三年底上海市实行粮食统销前，私营米店每担米的售价都比国营公司高出一千元（旧币），实行粮食统销私营粮店转为代销店后，上海市六百万市民每月就避免了私商这项剥削约八亿元（旧币）。
    自实行粮食统购统销后，由于国家保证了人民的合理供应和取消了粮商的中间剥削，人们认为“神仙难定的五谷价”就稳定了。城市人民可以买到价钱公道，质量很好的粮食了，再也不必为买不到粮食和粮价不稳定而发愁了。广州市一个曾被饥饿逼迫得把孩子送了人的五金工人，由于粮价稳定和免除了奸商的剥削，全家不但能吃得饱，而且生活大大提高，他们再不为吃饭问题发愁了。河北省保定市面粉厂的工人吕凤臣说：粮价稳定后，由于工人们再不惦记家里的吃饭问题，都能安心生产，厂里的产量从粮食统购统销到一九五四年十一月，提高了百分之十二点一。许多城市居民都满意地说：过去是锅里常常无米，现在把水烧开再去买米也不迟；以前大人们买米也常受骗，现在让小孩子去买也不用操心了。去年武汉市、安庆市被大水包围的几个月中，不仅粮价稳定，供应如常，市内的国营粮店和合作社还派人把粮食送到被水淹的灾民住地。重庆市原来的许多粮食店和大米加工厂多集中在人口稠密的市中心区。解放后城市向郊区发展了，不少新的市区特别是劳动人民居住的地区粮食店很少，有的郊区甚至没有粮食店，居民买粮很不方便。实行粮食统销后，粮食管理局按地区、人口和市民买粮的习惯，组成了全市的粮食供应网。集中一地的代销店和大米加工厂，在政府协助下进行了适当的迁移。现在居民买米比以前方便多了。遇到过年过节，国营粮店、合作社和代销店还要按市民的生活习惯准备大量的糯米、黄米、红豆等，尽量满足人们的要求。这种情况各个城市都是一样的。
    上述那些好处，仅仅是目前城市人民得到的看得见的物质利益，我们还必须看到实行粮食统购统销对城市人民和全国人民的更大的长远利益。这主要表现在它保证了社会主义建设的需要和有利于社会主义建设的进行。必须了解，只有实现了社会主义建设，发展了工农业生产才能不断提高全体人民的物质生活和文化生活，市镇居民也才能过幸福的日子。实行粮食统购统销以后，充分保证了工业建设的需要，促进了工业生产的发展，同时也大大地加强了对城乡资本主义的限制、改造和利用。各个城市中所有的粮商、米店都很快地纳入了国家资本主义的轨道，已从“投机取巧、唯利是图”的资本主义经营方式，改变为为城市人民粮食供应工作服务的代销店；同时从粮食方面开始割断了城乡资本主义的联系，削弱了资本主义对农民的影响，致命地打击和限制了富农的粮食投机行为。而且由于粮食的统购统销进一步加强了工人阶级和农民的经济联盟，农民一方面把粮食卖给国家，一方面依靠国营商店、合作社及其所领导的市场供应生产资料和生活资料。这样，不仅加速了工、农业产品的流转，避免了中间剥削；并由于社会主义经济领导的加强，推动了农村各种经济工作，也大大地促进了农业的社会主义改造和农业生产的发展。目前我国粮食是够吃够用的，但是并不宽裕。如果要从根本上改变这种情况，大量增产粮食和其他农产品，只有逐步实现农业合作化才有可能。合作化运动所以能够在农村蓬勃发展，粮食统购统销政策在农村的实行，是促成这种形势的主要原因之一。
    最近国务院公布的市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法，进一步地加强了市镇粮食统销工作。这正是为了巩固市镇人民已得的目前的切身利益，同时也是保证实现全体城乡人民更大的长远利益。因此，市镇人民应该深刻地认识这个道理。认识了这个道理的人，就应该耐心地去说服那些思想不通或认识得不透彻的人，使他们认识实行市镇粮食定量供应办法对自己的切身利益和长远利益。同时也应该使他们懂得，实行这个办法，只有对那些想钻空子进行粮食投机的人不利。只有大家对这些道理都认识清楚了，并时时警惕和揭发反革命分子和坏人的造谣破坏，才能顺利地实施这个办法，也才能巩固自己目前的已得利益和保证实现更大的长远利益。
