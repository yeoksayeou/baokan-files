Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 4th: According to Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao," the Japanese Press and Broadcasting Delegation to China, after concluding its visit to China, arrived in Hong Kong on September 3rd on its way back home and held a press conference that day.

    The head of the delegation, Saneyoshi Yokota, Vice President of Japan's "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun," first praised China's achievements in the past six years at the press conference. He concluded: "China is moving forward, and this remarkable phenomenon is undeniable by anyone." Yokota continued: I believe that normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan should be restored. Before this step is realized, some easier things can be done immediately, such as cultural exchanges, mutual visits between the people of the two countries, and the development of trade.

    Toyoo Kuga, Foreign News Director of Japan's Kyodo News, said: "The new China is moving towards an increasingly stable direction, and I believe that she will be even stronger in the future because her government has the support of the broad masses." He also said: "The Chinese government, with the support of the masses, will not face any internal dangers. Possible threats can only come from outside, especially from her east. Because of this, China is determined to liberate Taiwan and advocates using negotiations to discuss with the United States how to ease tensions in the Taiwan area. This threat may also come from Japan. Therefore, China hopes to restore normal relations with Japan. I think the Japanese government should also try its best to normalize Sino-Japanese relations." Finally, Kuga answered some reporters' questions about whether China needs peace in an affirmative tone, saying: "Yes, because they want to build their country well."

    日本新闻界广播界代表团在香港招待记者
    新华社广州四日电　据香港“大公报”消息：日本新闻界广播界访华代表团结束了在中国的访问参观活动后，九月三日在回国途中抵达香港，并且在当天举行了记者招待会。
    代表团团长、日本“产业经济新闻”社副社长横田实在记者招待会上首先赞扬中国六年来的成就，他得出结论说：“中国正在迈步前进，这种显著的现象是没有一个人能够否认的”。横田实继续说：我认为中日间的正常外交关系应该恢复，在实现这一步之前，有些比较容易做的事可以立刻就开始做，比方文化交流，两国人民的互相访问，贸易的开展等等。
    代表团团员、日本共同通讯社外信局长久我丰雄说：“新中国是向着越来越稳定的方向前进着，我相信她将来一定会比现在更强大，因为她的政府获有广大群众的支持。”他又说：“有着群众支持的中国政府，在内部已不会产生任何危险。可能的威胁，只能来自外面，尤其是她的东面。正因为这样，中国决心要解放台湾，并且主张用谈判方式来和美国讨论缓和台湾地区紧张局势的问题。这威胁也可能来自日本，因此，中国希望和日本恢复正常关系。我认为日本政府也应该尽可能设法使中日关系正常化。”久我丰雄最后用肯定的语气答复一些记者提出的中国是否需要和平的问题，他说：“是的，因为他们要好好地建设自己的国家”。
