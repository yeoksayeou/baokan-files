The education in Yugoslavia today is based on the following principles:
    (1) Education at all levels (from primary school to university) is free, and all children, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or social background, have equal opportunities for enrollment. (2) In general education schools (primary and secondary), students of Yugoslav nationalities and ethnic minorities are taught in their native languages. (3) Compulsory education is stipulated for eight years, with students aged seven to fifteen. (4) Schools are managed by the state. Private schools may only be established with legal permission, and they must be subject to state supervision. (5) Schools are separate from the church. Teaching is non-religious. (6) Students from all types of schools (general education and vocational education) can enter corresponding higher education institutions or universities.
      Most of these principles were introduced into the Yugoslav education system only after World War II, thus greatly improving the pre-war Yugoslav education system, which was undemocratic. It not only prohibited the use of minority languages in primary schools, but also the language of the Macedonians, who are one of the constituent nationalities of Yugoslavia.
    After the war, the state vigorously established new schools and developed education. Students receive financial assistance through scholarships and the provision of dormitories and cafeterias. All students enjoy free healthcare and are exempt from military service during their studies.
    In 1945, when the country was first liberated, a four- to seven-year compulsory education system was implemented. In 1952, an eight-year compulsory education system was implemented. Due to the lack of sufficient eight-year schools, it was stipulated that the eight-year system be achieved through other schools, such as attending primary school for four years and secondary school for four years.
      Primary School Statistics	Number of Schools	Number of Teachers	Number of Students	Percentage of Female Students
    1939	8,956	32,100	1,428,000	42.6
    1947	2,145	23,300	1,478,000	43.2
    1952	13,661	29,700	1,422,000	46.2
    From the above figures, it appears that the increase in the number of teachers has not kept pace with the increase in the number of students compared to pre-war levels. This is due to the loss of teacher talent during the war.
    With the exception of a small number of junior high schools that teach Latin in the first year and Greek in the third year, all other secondary schools do not teach classical languages.
    The courses taught in senior high schools include: national language, two elective foreign languages (selected from English, French, Russian, German, and Italian), history, geography, biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, philosophy, moral education, art, and physical education.
    Students who complete four years of secondary school or eight years of school can enter any vocational school or continue higher education. Secondary education ends with a graduation examination. Students who pass the graduation examination can enter universities or other higher education institutions.
    In 1939, Yugoslavia had 205 higher education institutions with 125,000 students. In 1952, there were 683 higher education institutions with 249,000 students.
    Special primary and secondary schools are established for the education of disabled children (mentally handicapped, deaf, mute, incapacitated, and uneducated). In 1939, there were a total of 21 such schools with 3,200 students. In 1952, there were 53 schools with 4,900 students.
    There are now schools established for young workers—technical schools and secondary vocational schools.
    The task of schools for young workers is to train excellent workers for industry, shipbuilding, mining, agriculture, transportation, etc. All apprentices over the age of fourteen must attend these schools.
    The task of technical schools is to train competent workers needed for industrial and other economic activities. Only those who have been outstanding workers or employees for at least three years can enter these schools. Their study period is two years.
    The task of secondary vocational schools is to train mid-level professionals for economic sectors and other social activities. There are secondary technical schools, secondary agricultural, forestry, economic, and medical schools. Only those who have received at least eight years of compulsory education can enter these schools. Graduates from these schools can enter corresponding colleges or higher schools.
    Primary school teachers are educated in teachers' colleges. Teachers for the upper grades of eight-year schools or the lower grades of higher education institutions are trained by higher teachers' colleges, with a study period of three years. Teachers for higher education institutions, teachers' colleges, and vocational schools are trained by the relevant art academies and academies of sciences.
                  1939             1952
    Teachers' Colleges	35 (4,000 students)	78 (24,600 students)
    Higher Teachers' Colleges	2 (300 students)	12 (5,600 students)
    Art Academies and Academies of Sciences	4 (2,900 students)	8 (11,900 students)
    Junior art schools include music, dance, and applied arts schools. Students are children aged eight to fourteen. This education is elective and supplementary, as students must also attend compulsory general education schools.
    Secondary art schools also include music, dance, and applied arts schools, and their purpose is to cultivate students' professional artistic abilities. In 1939, there were a total of 21 primary and secondary art schools with 3,200 students; in 1952, there were 147 schools with 15,300 students.
    As for higher education institutions, these refer to schools that require high school graduation for admission, regardless of whether they are called universities, colleges, or higher schools, they are all at the college level.
    The development of higher education institutions in each republic follows its own path according to the political and economic conditions experienced in different regions of the former Yugoslavia. In Ljubljana, the first higher education institution was established at the end of the 16th century (1595), and the first local university was established in 1919. In Zagreb, the first higher education institution appeared in 1669, and the university was established in 1874. In Serbia, the first higher education institution opened in 1838, and the university opened in 1905. Skopje had its first college in 1920 and its first university in 1946. In Sarajevo, the first college opened in 1940, and the local university was not established until 1949.
    In 1938-39, Yugoslavia had only three universities and 29 colleges, higher schools, and academies of sciences, with a total of 17,700 students. By 1953-54, there were five universities, 72 colleges, higher schools, and academies of sciences, with a total of 75,543 students.
    In 1951-52, there were 3,400 students studying agriculture and forestry, 2,000 veterinary students, 10,300 engineering students, 4,700 economics students, 6,400 law students, 8,900 medical students, 19,100 art students, and 600 theology students.
    Generally, the curriculum of colleges is four to six years, the curriculum of art academies is four to five years, and the curriculum of higher schools is four years.
    Students from senior high schools or secondary vocational schools can enter higher education institutions, but students from secondary vocational schools must have two years of practical work experience in their respective fields before applying. High school graduates can apply to any higher education institution, while graduates of vocational schools can only apply to corresponding higher education institutions.

### 关于南斯拉夫教育事业的资料

    关于南斯拉夫教育事业的资料
    南斯拉夫今天的教育是基于下列原则的：
    （一）各级的教育（从小学到大学）是免费的，全体儿童不分性别、民族、宗教或社会出身，入学的机会平等。（二）在普通教育的学校（小学和中学）里，对南斯拉夫民族的学生和少数民族的学生，都是用他们本民族的语言来教学的。（三）义务教育的时间规定为八年，学童的年龄为七岁到十五岁。（四）学校都是国家管理的。只有经法律许可才可以开办私立的学校，它们必须受国家的监督。（五）学校和教会分离。教课是非宗教的。（六）各种学校（普通教育和专业性教育的）的学生，都可以进入相应的高等学校或大学。
      这些原则绝大部分是在第二次大战后才引用到南斯拉夫的教育制度上来，因此大大地改善了战前南斯拉夫的教育制度，那时的教育制度是不民主的，它不但不允许在小学里用少数民族的语言教学，连组成南斯拉夫民族之一的马其顿人的语言也不准用。
    战后，国家大力兴办新的学校，发展教育事业。学生们通过奖学金和供给他们的宿舍和食堂而得到经济上的援助。所有的学生都享受到免费的保健事业，而且在就学期间免服兵役。
    一九四五年当国家刚解放之后，便实行四年到七年制的义务教育，到一九五二年实行八年制的义务教育。由于缺乏足够的八年制的学校，曾经规定通过其他学校来实现八年制，例如在小学读四年、在中学读四年。
      小学数字统计	  学校数      教员人数      学生人数	  女学生所占百分比一九三九　八、九五六　三二、一○○　一、四二八、○○○　四二·六一九四七　二、一四五　二三、三○○　一、四七八、○○○　四三·二一九五二　一三、六六一　二九、七○○　一、四二二、○○○　四六·二
    从上述数字看来，和战前相比，教员人数的增加并未能适应学生人数的增加。这是由于教员人材在战争中遭受到损失。
    除了一小部分初级中学是在一年级开始教拉丁文、在三年级教希腊文之外，所有其他中学都是不教古典文的。
    在高级中学里所教授的课程有：国语，选修两门外国语（从英文、法文、俄文、德文、意大利文中选修），历史，地理，生物，物理，化学，数学，哲学，道德教育，美术，体育。
    念完中学四年或八年制学校的学生，可以进入任何职业学校或继续高等教育。中学教育经过毕业考试而终了。通过毕业考试的学生可以进大学或其他高等学校。
    在一九三九年，南斯拉夫有二○五所高等学校，十二万五千名学生，在一九五二年已有六八三所高等学校，二十四万九千名学生。
    对于残废儿童（神智不健全的、聋的、哑的、丧失活动能力的、缺乏教养的）的教育，有专设的初级和中级学校。在一九三九年这种学校一共有二十一所，有学生三千二百人，在一九五二年有五十三所，学生四千九百人。
    现在有为劳动青年而设立的学校——工艺学校和中等职业学校。
    为劳动青年而设立的学校的任务，是为工业、造船业、矿业、农业、运输业……培养出优良的工人。所有十四岁以上的学徒都要入这种学校学习。
    工艺学校的任务是培养出工业和其它经济活动所需要的称职的工人。只有那些至少当过三年优秀工人或职工的人才能入这种学校。他们的学习期限为两年。
    中等职业学校的任务是给经济部门和其他社会活动部门培养中级专业人员。有中等技术学校、中等农业、林业、经济和医学学校。只有那些起码已经受过八年义务教育的人才可以进这些学校。从这些学校出来的毕业生可以进入相当的学院或高级学校。
    小学教师是从师范学校里教育出来的。八年制学校的高年级的教师或高等学校的低年级教师是由高等师范学校来培养的，学习期间为三年。高等学校、师范学校和职业学校的师资由各有关的艺术学院和科学院来培养。		  一九三九年		一九五二年师范学校	  三十五所（四千学生）	七十八所（二万四千六百学生）高等师范	  二所（三百学生）	十二所（五千六百学生）艺术学院和科学院  四所（二千九百学生）	八所（一万一千九百学生）
    初级艺术学校包括音乐、舞蹈和实用艺术学校。学生都是八岁到十四岁的儿童。这种教育是选修的和补助性的，因为学生们同时还要进义务制的普通教育的学校。
    中等艺术学校也包括音乐、舞蹈和实用艺术学校，其目的是培养学生的专业艺术能力。一九三九年，初、中级艺术学校共有二十一所，三千二百名学生；一九五二年有一百四十七所，学生一万五千三百人。
    至于高等学校，是指那些规定必须高中毕业的人才能进去的学校，不管它们的名称是大学、学院或高级学校，全都一样。它们全都是属于学院水平的。
    每个共和国的高等学校的发展，都是按照过去南斯拉夫不同地区所经历的政治和经济条件，而各有其发展道路。在卢布尔雅纳，第一所高等学校的成立是在十六世纪末叶（一五九五年），而第一所当地的大学设立于一九一九年。在萨格勒布，第一所高等学校出现于一六六九年，大学成立于一八七四年。在塞尔维亚，第一所高等学校在一八三八年开课，大学在一九○五年开课。斯科普里在一九二○年才有第一所学院，一九四六年才有了大学。在萨拉也伏，一九四○年开办了第一所学院，而当地的大学直到一九四九年才成立起来。
    在一九三八—三九年间，南斯拉夫只有三所大学和二十九个学院、高等学校和科学院，共有学生一万七千七百人。到了一九五三—五四年，已有五所大学，七十二个学院、高等学校、科学院，共有学生七万五千五百四十三人。
    在一九五一—五二年，学习农业和林业的学生三千四百人，兽医学生二千人，工程学生一万零三百人，学经济的学生四千七百人，法律系学生六千四百人，医学学生八千九百人，艺术学生一万九千一百人，神学生六百人。
    一般地，学院的课程为四年到六年，艺术学院的课程为四年到五年，高级学校为四年。
    从高级中学或中等职业学校出来的学生可以进入高等学校，但是中等职业学校的学生在投考前必须具有其本行的两年的实际工作经历。高中毕业生可以投考任何高等学校，至于职业学校的毕业生只能投考相应的高等学校。
