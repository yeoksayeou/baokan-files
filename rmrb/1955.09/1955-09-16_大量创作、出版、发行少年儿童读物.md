Excellent children's books are a powerful tool for conducting communist education among children. In the past two years, great changes have taken place in the publication of children's books in our country. State-owned and joint state-private publishing houses have come to occupy an absolute advantage in the publication of children's books. The socialist transformation of private children's book publishers has been basically completed, thus improving the quality of children's books and greatly changing the situation of shoddy products. However, there are still many problems in the publication of children's books. The most serious is the extreme shortage of children's books. The variety, quantity, and quality are far from meeting the needs of children. Solving these problems is an extremely important task in the current children's education cause.

We should look at the current situation of the lack of children's books: In 1954, the total number of children's books printed nationwide was more than 13.69 million copies. There are nearly 120 million children aged six to fifteen in the country, of which about 70 million are literate, with an average of one copy for every five people. In the city of Lüda, there are 180,000 children in school, but the city's children's libraries and cultural centers have only more than 40,000 children's books, an average of one book for every four or five people. Children's books are even more lacking in rural areas. According to statistics from Hebei Province, there is an average of one book for every 1,100 children. Children do not have the necessary reading materials, so they read books that are not suitable for their level. This not only fails to promote the normal development of their intelligence, but also destroys the good habit of children loving to read because these books are difficult to understand. What is even more serious is that many children are still circulating reactionary, obscene, and absurd books, and their physical and mental health is being poisoned.

The reason why children's books are so scarce is that the creation, publishing, and distribution departments do not care about children, do not understand that ensuring the supply of children's books is a major issue related to the education of a new generation, and therefore have not paid attention to this matter, have not put it on their work plan, or have not given it a certain position. The Chinese Writers Association rarely seriously studies the issue of developing children's literature creation. Most local federations of literary and art circles do not have plans for children's literature creation, and some writers have the wrong idea of ​​underestimating children's literature creation. The publishing and editing forces of professional children's book publishing houses are very weak, and the people's publishing houses in various provinces and cities neglect this work, some even have never published children's books, and this item is not included in their work plans at all. The bookstore supply and distribution work is also very poor. Many bookstore staff have one-sided views, thinking that as long as "the distribution work for workers, peasants, and soldiers is done well, it doesn't matter whether children's books are taken care of or not." Some bookstore staff also have capitalist business views, only willing to promote thick books with high prices and large profits, and are not interested in thin, low-priced, and low-profit children's books and are unwilling to stock them.

We need to make demands on writers, editors, and publishing and distribution workers: pay more attention to the creation, publication, and distribution of children's books! Because children are the bearers of future construction undertakings. The current 120 million children will be the executors of the second five-year plan or the third five-year plan. Their physique, cultural literacy, and character have the most direct impact on the future of our country. We must cultivate them into new socialists, cultivate them into new people with strong physiques, communist morality, a materialist worldview, scientific knowledge, basic production knowledge, and cultural literacy. Once they grow up, they can inherit the cause of their elders and take on the arduous task of socialist and communist construction. Therefore, children's education is truly a fundamental cause related to the future of our country and society, and it is truly a century-old plan for our country. Although children are mainly educated in school classrooms, they must also be educated outside of school and outside of class by reading literary and scientific works. At the same time, in the past two or three years and in the next few years, there will still be a group of primary school graduates who cannot go to higher schools every year. Some engage in production, and some participate in self-study. They also need to consolidate the knowledge they have gained in school and continue to absorb new knowledge. This mainly depends on reading children's books and other reading materials. Therefore, both school children and out-of-school children urgently need a large number of children's books.

According to the needs of the vast number of children and the current shortage of children's books, our policy should be to create, publish, and distribute a large number of children's books in an effort to ensure a continuous supply of children's books. To this end, the Chinese Writers Association must first formulate a plan to prosper the creation of children's literature and strengthen leadership over the creation of children's literature. It is necessary to promote the atmosphere of writing for children among writers, overcome the idea of ​​underestimating children's literature, and organize a group of writers with a certain level to go deep into life and create for children. And require writers to write a certain number of things for children within a certain period of time. In order to continuously strengthen the creation of children's literature, on the one hand, it is necessary to establish a team of professional children's literature writers. This team does not have to be very large. The purpose is to play a backbone demonstration role to improve the writing level of children's books. On the one hand, we must train a large number of new writers. At present, among the cadres of the Communist Youth League, teachers, counselors, and state employees, there are many beginners who like to write children's books and have development prospects. The Chinese Writers Association and local federations of literary and art circles should give them enthusiastic care and guidance and help them grow up, instead of letting them fend for themselves. In addition, the Chinese Writers Association should also cooperate with the China Association for Science and Technology to organize some scientists and writers to create some beautiful scientific and literary works for children year by year through cooperative methods, in order to overcome the current phenomenon of dryness and boredom in children's science books.

We must expand the editing departments of existing children's book publishing institutions and establish professional children's book publishing houses; people's publishing houses in provinces and cities with conditions should set up children's book editing offices to be responsible for publishing some children's books needed locally. Publishing houses should strive to improve their business, strengthen mass work, truly closely link readers and writers, give writers practical help, and at the same time reduce the prices of children's books and improve the printing quality of children's books. Relevant government departments should give all necessary and possible preferential treatment to the publication of children's books. In this way, 40 million to 60 million copies of children's books can be printed every year in two or three years. The Xinhua Bookstore Main Store and several provincial and municipal branches should set up special institutions to manage the distribution of children's books and gradually establish a set of distribution systems. Strengthen the socialist ideological education of bookstore staff and overcome certain capitalist business ideas. Encourage them to actively serve children, face children, establish close contacts with schools, and actively recommend new books to schools, parents, and children.

At present, it is correct to focus on solving the quantity problem of children's books; but we cannot ignore quality because of this. Shoddy work is also wrong. It should be said that children's books still have many shortcomings in terms of content and form. Of the 187 kinds of children's books published by the China Youth Publishing House and the Children's Publishing House in 1954, very few can catch up with the level of award-winning works in 1953, which is a very noteworthy issue. Therefore, continuously improving the quality of children's books is still an important task.

Overcoming the serious phenomenon of the extreme shortage of children's books is an important matter. All relevant departments should seriously treat this matter, determine plans to improve the creation, publication, and distribution of children's books, and strive to fundamentally change this situation in the shortest possible time so that children have more books to read.

### 大量创作、出版、发行少年儿童读物

    大量创作、出版、发行少年儿童读物
    优良的少年儿童读物是向少年儿童进行共产主义教育的有力工具。近两年来，我国少年儿童读物的出版工作发生了很大变化，国营和公私合营出版社所出版的少年儿童读物已占绝对优势，基本上完成了对私营儿童读物出版商的社会主义改造，因而少年儿童读物的质量有了提高，粗制滥造的状况大大改变。但是，少年儿童读物的出版工作至今还存在不少问题，最严重的是少年儿童读物奇缺，种类、数量、质量都远远不能满足少年儿童的需要。解决这些问题就是目前少年儿童教育事业中的一项极其重要的任务。
    应该看看少年儿童读物缺乏的现状：一九五四年全国少年儿童读物的印数共一千三百六十九万多册，全国六岁到十五岁的少年儿童约近一亿二千万人，其中识字的约有七千万人，平均五个人才有一册。旅大市就学儿童共十八万人，全市儿童图书馆和文化馆的少年儿童书籍，却只有四万多册，平均四、五个人才有一本。农村的少年儿童读物更是缺乏，据河北省统计，平均一千一百多个儿童才有一本。少年儿童没有必要的读物，便阅读一些不适合自己水平的书籍。这不只不能促进他们智力的正常发展，而且会因为这些书籍难懂，破坏了少年儿童爱好读书的优良习惯。更严重的是许多少年儿童至今还在互相传看反动、淫秽、荒诞的图书，身心健康都遭受毒害。
    少年儿童读物所以十分缺乏，是因为创作、出版和发行部门不关心少年儿童，不了解保证少年儿童读物的供应是关系一代新人的教育的重大问题，因而没有重视这件事情，没有把它摆在自己的工作计划之内，或没有给它一定的位置。中国作家协会很少认真研究发展少年儿童文学创作的问题，各地文联大多没有关于少年儿童文学创作的计划，有些作家存在轻视少年儿童文学创作的错误思想。专业的少年儿童读物出版社的出版编辑力量很薄弱，而各省市的人民出版社又忽视这一工作，有的甚至从来没有出版过少年儿童读物，工作计划里也根本没有这一条。书店供应发行工作也作得很差，不少书店工作人员有片面的看法，以为只要“作好工农兵的发行工作就行了，儿童读物管不管没有关系”。有些书店工作人员还存在资本主义经营观点，只愿推销价高利大的厚本书，对本薄、价低、利小的少年儿童读物没有兴趣，不愿进货。
    我们有必要向作家们、编辑们、出版发行工作者们提出要求：更多地注意少年儿童读物的创作、出版和发行工作吧！因为少年儿童是未来的建设事业的担当者。现在的一亿二千万少年儿童，将是第二个五年计划或第三个五年计划的执行者。他们的体格、文化教养和品质，对于我们国家的未来，有着最直接的影响。我们必须把他们培养成为社会主义的新人，把他们培养成为体质健壮，具有共产主义道德品质、唯物主义世界观、科学知识、生产基础知识及文化教养的新人，一旦他们长大成人，就可以继承长辈的事业，把艰巨的社会主义共产主义建设任务担当起来。所以少年儿童教育真正是关系我们国家和社会未来的一项根本事业，真正是我们国家的百年大计。少年儿童虽然主要的是在学校的课堂中受到教育，但他们也要在校外和课外受到教育，阅读文艺的和科学的读物。同时，过去的两三年和今后的若干年内，每年还有一批不能升学的高小毕业生，或者从事生产，或者参加自学，他们也需要巩固在学校里面得到的知识，并不断吸取新的知识，这主要依靠阅读少年儿童读物和其他读物。所以不论在校少年儿童或校外少年儿童，都迫切需要有大量的儿童读物。
    根据广大少年儿童的需要和目前儿童读物奇缺的情况，我们的方针应当是大量创作、出版、发行少年儿童读物，以努力保证少年儿童读物的源源供应。为此，首先须要由中国作家协会拟定繁荣少年儿童文学创作的计划，加强对少年儿童文学创作的领导。要在作家当中提倡为少年儿童写作的风气，克服轻视少年儿童文学的思想，组织一批具有一定水平的作家深入生活，为少年儿童创作。并要求作家们在一定时间之内为少年儿童写一定数量的东西。为了不断加强少年儿童文学创作工作，一方面要建立 一支专业的少年儿童文学作家的队伍，这支队伍不必很大，目的在于起骨干示范作用，以提高少年儿童读物的写作水平。一方面要大量培养新作家。目前在青年团干部、教师、辅导员、国家工作人员当中，有不少喜爱写作少年儿童读物并有发展前途的初学写作者。中国作家协会和各地文联应当给他们以热情的关怀和指导，帮助他们成长起来，而不应任其自生自灭。另外，中国作家协会还应当配合中华全国科学技术普及协会，组织一些科学家和作家，用合作的方法，逐年为少年儿童创作一些优美的科学文艺读物，以克服目前少年儿童科学读物枯燥乏味的现象。
    必须扩大现有的少年儿童读物出版机构的编辑部门，并增设专业的少年儿童读物出版社；在各省市有条件的人民出版社设立儿童读物编辑室，负责出版一部分当地需要的儿童读物。出版社应当努力改进业务，加强群众工作，真正把读者和作者密切地联系起来，给作家以切实的帮助，同时应当降低少年儿童读物的价格，提高少年儿童读物的印刷质量。政府有关部门对少年儿童读物的出版工作应给予种种必要和可能的优待。这样，在两三年内每年都可以印刷四千万到六千万册少年儿童读物。新华书店总店和若干省市分店应当设立专门管理少年儿童读物发行工作的机构，并逐步建立一套发行制度。加强对书店工作人员的社会主义思想教育，克服某些资本主义经营思想。鼓励他们积极为少年儿童服务，面向少年儿童，同学校建立密切联系，主动地向学校、家长、少年儿童推荐新书。
    目前应当着重解决儿童读物的数量问题，这是正确的；但不能因此忽视质量。粗制滥造也是不对的。应当说，不论在内容方面，形式方面，儿童读物都还有不少缺点。一九五四年中国青年出版社和少年儿童出版社出版的一百八十七种少年儿童读物，能够赶上一九五三年评奖作品水平的极少，这是很值得注意的问题。因此，不断提高少年儿童读物的质量，仍然是一项重要的任务。
    克服少年儿童读物奇缺的严重现象，是一件重要的事情。各有关部门应当认真对待这件事情，确定改进少年儿童读物创作、出版、发行工作的计划，争取在最短的时间内，基本上改变这种状况，使孩子们有更多的书读。
