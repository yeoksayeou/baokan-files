Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 4th: Japanese "Defense Agency" Director-General Shigemasa Sunada publicly appointed nine former Japanese Army and Navy generals on the 2nd as members of the planned military advisory group of the "Defense Agency." They are the first group of former Japanese military generals to be openly reinstated to military professions after the war. Shigemasa Sunada said that they would offer him advice on "defense" issues, including the research and manufacture of weapons.

These nine former Japanese military generals were all direct participants in the Japanese militarist war of aggression. They include General Sadaichi Shimomura, the wartime Minister of the Army and Supreme Commander of the North China Area of the China Expeditionary Army, General Hitoshi Imamura, former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in Indochina, Takeo Yasuda, former Director-General of Aviation, Yoriyasu Sawamoto, former Vice Minister of the Navy, and Shigeru Fukudome, former Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet.

The appointment of members of the military advisory group is another measure by the Japanese government to strengthen its rearmament institutions. Not long ago, the Japanese Cabinet established the "Defense Cabinet Ministers' Informal Discussion Group" and is planning to expand the "Defense Agency" into a "Ministry of Defense."

    日本政府公然起用前陆海军将领
    新华社四日讯　东京消息：日本“防卫厅”长官砂田重政二日公然任命九名前日本陆海军将领为“防卫厅”的计划中的军事顾问团的成员。他们是战后第一批被公开恢复军事职业的前日军将领。砂田重政说，他们将就“防务”问题，包括武器的研究和制造问题，向他提出建议。
    这九名前日军将领，都是日本军国主义侵略战争的直接参与者。他们包括，战时的陆相、中国派遣军华北区最高指挥官下村定，前日本驻印度支那陆军总司令今村均，前航空总监安田武雄，前海军省次官泽本赖雄，前联合舰队参谋长福留繁等。
    军事顾问团成员的任命，是日本政府加强重整军备的机构的又一措施。不久以前，日本内阁成立了“防卫阁员恳谈会”，并且正在筹划把“防卫厅”扩建为“国防省”。
