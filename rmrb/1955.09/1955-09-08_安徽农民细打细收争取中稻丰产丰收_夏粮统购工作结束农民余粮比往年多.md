Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 6th. Farmers in the areas north and south of the Yangtze River and south of the Huai River in Anhui Province are adopting various meticulous harvesting methods to reap a bumper harvest of intermediate rice. Farmers in Jinma Township, Feixi County, installed cloth pockets on more than 240 newly made and repaired rice threshing floors to catch any scattered rice grains during harvesting. The Feguang Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved thorough cutting, threshing, sweeping, and cleaning during harvesting. The cooperative's two production teams harvested an extra 645 catties of grain. Farmers in the WuHu area generally threshed the rice bundles twice. In Zhuma Township, He County, they threshed 1,010 mu of rice fields’ bundles, yielding an additional 16,800 catties of rice. Farmers in Qianyou Township, Xuan County, changed the previous rough harvesting practices and estimated that the township could harvest an additional 70,000 catties of grain, equivalent to the yield of more than 150 mu of rice fields. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in many areas also organized women and children to pick up rice ears in the fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 6th. The unified purchase of summer grain in Anhui Province has concluded. Since July, Anhui Province's surplus grain has been continuously transported to other provinces.

Anhui Province had a bumper harvest of summer crops this year. Farmers throughout the province, especially those who suffered from floods last year, were grateful for the state's help and sold large quantities of surplus grain. The Shengji Agricultural Production Cooperative in Santa Township, Funan County, received 4,000 catties of grain from the state for supply and relief this spring. They have now sold 14,000 catties of grain to the state. Farmers in Bo County, Xiao County, Dangshan County, and Guoyang County completed their grain sales plans in mid-July. After selling grain, farmers had more surplus grain than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 6th. Farmers in the Huaibei Plain and along the river areas of Anhui Province, which suffered from floods last year, no longer need state grain supplies for their rations.

Anhui Province had a bumper harvest of summer grain crops and early rice this year. Due to the reform of agricultural production and the expansion of the planting area of summer grain crops, farmers harvested more grain this summer than in previous summers. Therefore, before the autumn harvest, the state supply was reduced ahead of schedule. Wuhu County in Huaibei, which relied on state supplies after suffering from disasters last year, had a bumper harvest of summer crops this year, with an average yield per mu exceeding the planned yield by 36 percent. After paying public grain, selling unified purchase grain to the state, and deducting seeds, feed, and rations before the autumn harvest, farmers had an average surplus of 131 catties of grain per person. Many grain-deficient households have become self-sufficient or surplus households.

    安徽农民细打细收争取中稻丰产丰收
    夏粮统购工作结束农民余粮比往年多
    新华社合肥六日电　安徽省长江两岸和淮河以南地区的农民，正在采用各种细收细打的办法收割中稻争取丰产丰收。肥西县金马乡农民在收割中，把新制成和修理好的二百四十多张稻床上装上了布兜，接纳撒落下来的稻粒子。肥光农业生产合作社在收割时做到了割净、掼净、扫净和打净，这个社的两个生产队就多收了六百四十五斤粮食。芜湖专区农民普遍翻打稻把两遍，和县乌江区驻马乡翻打了一千零十亩稻田的稻把，就多打了一万六千八百斤稻子。宣城县千又乡农民改变了往年粗收粗放现象，估计全乡能多收七万斤粮食，等于一百五十多亩稻田的产量。许多地区的农业生产合作社和互助组还组织妇女、儿童到田里拾稻穗。
    新华社合肥六日电　安徽省夏季粮食统购工作已经结束。从七月份开始，安徽省余粮就源源运往省外。
    安徽省今年夏收作物丰收。全省农民特别是去年遭受水灾的农民，感激国家的帮助大量出卖余粮。阜南县三塔乡盛集农业生产合作社，今年春季得到国家供应和救济的粮食有四千斤，他们现在已卖了一万四千斤粮食给国家。亳县、萧县、砀山、涡阳等县农民，在七月中旬就完成了售粮计划。农民在卖粮后，剩余粮食都比往年增加。
    新华社合肥六日电　安徽省去年遭受水灾的淮北平原和沿江地区，农民的口粮目前已不再需要国家供应。
    今年安徽省的夏季粮食作物和早稻丰收。由于进行了农业生产的改革，扩大了夏季粮食作物的播种面积，农民今年夏季比往年夏季收获了更多的粮食。因此在秋收前，就提早减少了国家供应量。淮北五河县去年受灾后，粮食靠国家供应，今年夏收作物丰收，平均每亩产量超过计划产量百分之三十六；农民除缴纳公粮、卖给国家的统购粮以及扣除种籽、饲料和秋收前的口粮外，平均每人还剩余粮食一百三十一斤。很多缺粮户已变成自给户或余粮户。
