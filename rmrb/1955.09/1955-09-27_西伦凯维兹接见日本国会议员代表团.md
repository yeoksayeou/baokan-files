The Polish people are following with friendly concern the great efforts made by the broad masses of the Japanese people in the struggle to safeguard peace, to ease international tensions, and to develop friendly relations between countries."

    西伦凯维兹接见日本国会议员代表团
    新华社华沙二十五日电　据波兰通讯社华沙讯：九月二十四日，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹接见了应波兰议会和波兰全国议员团的邀请到波兰访问的日本国会议员代表团。
    在接见时，参议员野沟胜代表日本国会议员讲话。他强调日本国会议员在波兰所受到的热诚招待，并且表示深信，他们的访问将有助于加强友好关系和建立两国间更加密切的合作。
    波兰部长会议主席接着讲话。他表示对日本代表的访问波兰感到非常高兴。西伦凯维兹随后说，虽然，在上次战争时期波兰人民和日本人民曾在敌对的阵营里面，但是现在在战争结束十年之后，这两个国家为了世界和平和国与国之间的友好，有着一切可能来建立更密切的文化、政治和经济关系。
    西伦凯维兹说，上次的战争使波兰和日本都遭受了无法估计的苦难和破坏，奥斯威辛的死亡营和广岛的惨剧，都是这种灾难的象征。“如果我们要从这些不幸的经历中得出结论的话，我们必须走为和平而斗争，为加强同世界各国人民之间的文化、政治和经济上的联系的道路。波兰人民正怀着友好的关切，注意着日本广大阶层人民在为了维护和平、为了缓和国际紧张局势和为了发展各国之间的友好关系而进行的斗争中所作的巨大努力。”
    接见时讲话的还有其他日本议员。他们都称赞波兰在和平建设工作中所取得的巨大成就。
