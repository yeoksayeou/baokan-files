    Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Today marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people are already living freely on most of their territory. They are celebrating this glorious anniversary with unparalleled excitement and joy.
    From the day the colonialists began their invasion of Vietnam, for nearly a hundred years, the Vietnamese people have consistently struggled against the invaders, demonstrating extraordinary courage and heroism. The guerrilla warfare of Zhang Ding and Zhang Juan in the south in 1867, the resistance movements of 1874, especially 1884, the twelve-year struggle led by Phan Đình Phùng from 1884 to 1896, and later the struggle led by Hoàng Hoa Thám, which continued until the eve of the First World War, the resistance movement in central Vietnam in 1907, the Biên Hòa uprising in 1914-1915, the Huế uprising in 1916, and the Thái Nguyên uprising in 1917, all these movements proved that the Vietnamese people had waged admirable and moving struggles for their freedom and national independence. However, during that period, the affairs of the country were still controlled by kings and feudal bureaucrats, whose policies were consistently betraying the people, and the people's wishes could not be realized.
    The Great October Revolution rang the bell, giving new impetus to the struggle for liberation of the oppressed people. The young Soviet regime quickly resolved the problems of the old colonies under the rule of the Tsarist government, restoring freedom to the oppressed people. This had a huge impact on all colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia. The victorious doctrines of Marx and Lenin pointed out the path of liberation for the people of all these countries.
    In Vietnam, the Marxist-Leninist party was born in January 1930 after the Yên Bái uprising. After this uprising, the bourgeoisie lost all its influence over the national liberation movement; the working class and peasant laboring masses were organized within their own party. The Party became the sole leader of the anti-imperialist revolution. In September 1930, the first people's government was established in three counties in central Vietnam. The imperialists suppressed this movement with unprecedented brutality. But from 1940 onwards, armed struggles were reorganized in northern, central, and southern Vietnam, with the aim of opposing French colonialists and Japanese imperialists. Although these resistance movements were still suppressed, they eventually became sparks that ignited the revolution five years later, destroying foreign rule in Vietnam.
    In May 1941, the national united front – the "Vietnam Independence League" – was born. This was the broadest organization ever seen in the history of our country's national liberation movement. The national united front, with the Party as the leading force, mobilized and organized guerrilla teams; throughout the Second World War, these guerrilla teams fought alongside the Allied forces, striking at the fascist aggressors.
    The victories achieved by the heroic Soviet army, first over Hitler's Germany, and then over Japanese imperialism, greatly contributed to the success of the general uprising in Vietnam on August 19, 1945, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on September 2.
    Under the favorable international situation that the collapse of fascism was inevitable, the August Revolution was able to achieve victory because it possessed three conditions, conditions that were indispensable for any anti-imperialist revolution in a colonial country, namely: the leadership of the working class, the organization of a broad anti-imperialist national front, and armed struggle.
    Since then, a glorious page has unfolded in our country's history. The Vietnamese people have gained freedom. The August Revolution not only freed the Vietnamese people from the shackles of the colonialists and all other forms of enslavement by the imperialists, but also eliminated the terrible exploitation by feudal landlords and feudal bureaucrats. For the first time, the working people became their own masters, the masters who determined the fate of the country. They began to work hard to stop the terrible famine, because in the last months of imperialist rule (from the end of 1944 to the beginning of 1945), as many as two million people had died of starvation. They tried their best to heal the wounds left by our country's disastrous slave system. This system of slavery continued until the middle of this century. They elected the National Assembly, began to build the people's government, and took various measures to eliminate the illiteracy and ignorance left behind by colonial rule.
    But the French colonialists always wanted to restore their oppressive rule. They took our peaceful attitude as weakness. Encouraged and supported by British and American imperialists, they colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, attacked the Vietnamese people in Saigon on September 23, and then attempted to enter the north. Subsequently, the French colonialists betrayed the obligations they had undertaken in the preliminary agreement of March 6, 1946, and the temporary agreement of September 14, launched the Haiphong massacre, occupied Lang Son, and provoked everywhere, until December 19 when our people began to launch a nationwide resistance against the invaders.
    Responding to the call of the Party and the democratic government, the people of the whole country united as one to protect the Party and the fruits of the August Revolution.
    When the patriotic war began, the material conditions were unfavorable for the Vietnamese people: famine was still rampant, the dogs of the French colonialists and Japanese imperialists were everywhere, and the People's Army was only established in the course of the war… At that time, the French expeditionary force's military superiority seemed certain; the enemy estimated all our difficulties, thinking that they could quickly defeat our young army and destroy our democratic government. But the evolution of facts proved that their estimate was completely wrong.
    With the support of American imperialists, the enemy soon launched a full-scale war, attacking the Vietnamese people. However, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the Vietnamese people concentrated all their strength and formed a seamless fighting entity. They did their best to strengthen guerrilla warfare, pushing it deep into the enemy's occupied rear areas. They consolidated their base areas and established their army with the enthusiastic support of the people. The People's Army was closely linked with the guerrillas, fighting bravely and eliminating enemy troops on several fronts. In the autumn and winter of 1947, in Viet Bac on the Sino-Vietnamese border, in the last months of 1950, in the northern midlands, the Red River Delta, Hoa Binh and Ba Vi, in 1951 along the Black River, in 1952 in southern Vietnam, in 1953 in Lai Châu, and finally on May 6, 1954, on the eve of the opening of the Geneva Conference, a decisive victory was achieved at Điện Biên Phủ. This victory greatly influenced the work of the Geneva Conference and promoted the signing of the Geneva Accords. This agreement guarantees the restoration of peace in Indochina based on the recognition of the national rights of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
    At the same time, the political conspiracies of the colonialists and imperialists, such as "using war to support war," "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," and the farces of "independence and democracy" and "land reform" performed by the imperialists' servants to deceive our people, all suffered shameful failures.
    Finally, throughout this period, the Party and the government devoted themselves to building and developing the economy, finance, and culture of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. First of all, land reform was implemented according to the principle of "land to the tiller." By striving to maintain and develop the indispensable sectors of small-scale industry and handicrafts, the residents and the army were supplied with various essential supplies. While encouraging the production of rice and other food crops, the Party and the government carried out irrigation and flood prevention work, and ensured that transportation was adequately developed.
    The state-owned part of the national economy, the state bank and commercial institutions, were established and continued to develop. National education, education for peasants and soldiers, and the fight to eliminate illiteracy, despite being carried out under difficult conditions, have achieved remarkable results.
    Therefore, in all these military, political, and economic fields, our young republic has gloriously passed the test of war. As Lenin taught us, all the qualities of a nation should be manifested in war.
    The people and the army united around the Party and the government, their love for the Party, and their moral and political unity helped us overcome enormous difficulties, endured the test, and prepared various conditions for victory in political, economic, and military aspects.
    The unwavering belief in the inevitable victory of the just cause inspired the courage of our people. The moral and fighting qualities that our soldiers, our guerrillas, and our cadres drew from the rich and colorful history of the national movement helped our young army accomplish many historic deeds; these deeds made their banner forever glorious.
    The precious examples of the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union have constantly inspired our people and our soldiers, and helped us cultivate our own heroes.
    The French people and peace-loving people all over the world have given us extremely valuable help. They stood with us in the extremely difficult days of the War of Resistance; they also rejoiced with us when peace was restored.
    The Democratic Republic has won a victory, and this victory will not disappear, because it is the victory of the oppressed over the oppressors, the victory of freedom over slavery. Our people have escaped the suffering of being enslaved again. The fruits of the August Revolution: peace, unity, independence, and democracy have been guaranteed and are being consolidated day by day.
    Peace has been restored in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
    The 1954 Geneva Conference brought us peace. But this peace is not consolidated when our country is still divided by the temporary demarcation line at the 17th parallel north. In addition, the arrogant attitude shown by the South Vietnamese authorities and its protectors poses a very serious threat to this peace, which has only been around for a year.
    Indeed, although the military phase of the Geneva Accords has been completed quite satisfactorily, liberating the entire territory of North Vietnam, the second phase, namely the work of restoring Vietnamese unity through general elections in 1956, has not yet begun due to the constant obstruction of the Ngo Dinh Diem government.
    The South Vietnamese authorities have carried out brutal persecution against our compatriots living in southern Vietnam, and against all patriots and peace-loving people: in one year, it has fabricated more than 300 cases, which is not only criminal behavior but also a violation of the Geneva Accords. At least four thousand patriots have been killed or injured, and more than nineteen thousand people have been arrested. In addition to these acts of terror, the Ngo Dinh Diem government is also wholeheartedly following the policies of the United States, determined to turn South Vietnam into a US colony and military base, and to incorporate it into the activities of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. Despite these actions, Ngo Dinh Diem shamelessly proclaims himself a "warrior" for the peace, democracy, and independence of Vietnam.
    This situation determines the tasks of the government of the Democratic Republic. The first goal is to thoroughly and completely implement the Geneva Accords, which means immediately convening a consultation conference between North and South Vietnam. This is the first step in preparing for free general elections and unifying the country. Therefore, peace and national unity are our main demands at present.
    Secondly, we must heal the wounds of war, gradually improve the living standards of our people, and build our new life so that everyone can live a truly free and democratic life. To this end, on the one hand, we must rebuild the national economy: agriculture, handicrafts, transportation, and industry. Since our people have been living in peace, they have bravely advanced along this path. But our work is still heavy, for example: restoring barren land to cultivation, repairing dikes to prevent floods, building irrigation systems to prevent droughts and famines. On the other hand, we should gradually improve the welfare of Vietnamese workers on the basis of improving labor productivity.
    Given the dilapidated conditions we inherited from war, colonialism, and feudalism, these tasks are heavy and complex. But the assistance of fraternal countries greatly increases the possibility of completing these tasks, allowing us to look forward to a future full of victory with confidence. Indeed, as a result of the meetings between the Vietnamese government delegation and the leaders of the Soviet and Chinese governments in July, the Soviet Union and China have decided to provide our country with a total of 1,530 billion Vietnamese currency in aid over the next few years. Other People's Democratic countries will also provide valuable assistance to our recovery efforts. This aid will supply us with materials, machinery, and technicians. The economic and cultural sectors of Vietnam will benefit greatly from this.
    This selfless, unconditional assistance, which is beneficial to our people, is completely different from the "assistance" understood by imperialists. Imperialists have always wanted to achieve the purpose of exploitation and enslavement through their "assistance." The notorious Marshall Plan clearly proves this point. All "beneficiaries" of the Marshall Plan have gradually lost their sovereignty.
    The policy adopted by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in its relations with other countries is very clear: it is a policy of peace and friendly relations. This policy is based on the Five Principles announced in the joint statements of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar, namely: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Bandung Conference specifically proved that these five principles have been endorsed by all aspects of Asian and African public opinion.
    We particularly hope to maintain peaceful relations with our neighbors, such as Cambodia and Laos. As for France, we still believe that under the conditions of absolute equality and mutual benefit, first of all, under the conditions of mutual trust and sincere cooperation, we can establish special economic and cultural relations with France.
    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country, if our people look back on the road they have traveled, they should feel proud. But at the same time, they should also turn their heads, especially to look to the future, to see what remains to be done. We are facing a political struggle that is difficult, long-term, and complex. However, if we are patient, firm, and prudent, if our Party and the national front continue to implement the long-tested principles of criticism and self-criticism, then we can be assured that we will achieve complete victory.
    In these ten years, the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism has made great progress. The Soviet Union has won a glorious victory against the fascist aggressors; it has made significant achievements in communist construction and in its policy of striving for peace and easing the international situation. The People's Democratic countries are becoming increasingly consolidated politically and economically. The victory of the Chinese revolution has liberated 600 million people, who are moving forward towards the goal of happiness with the same pace. With the fraternal support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people have victoriously repelled the aggressive forces of the Lee Seung-man gang, the United States, and its fifteen puppet states. The Vietnamese people have won victory in the war imposed on them by the French colonialists and have won peace in Geneva. The forces of peace are growing and the position of peace is becoming more consolidated. All these victories have inspired our people, giving them unlimited confidence in our bright future and in the inevitable victory of our cause.
    Despite the many difficulties and obstacles ahead, we still move forward with the confidence of victors and in the posture of victors! (Attached image)

    越南民主共和国成立十周年
    越南民主共和国主席  胡志明
    今天是越南民主共和国十周年诞辰。越南人民已经自由地生活在自己的大部分领土之上。他们以无比兴奋和愉快的心情来庆祝这个光荣的纪念日。
    从殖民主义者开始侵略越南的那天起，在将近一百年当中，越南人民始终不懈地进行着斗争，反抗侵略者，表现了异常的勇敢和英雄气概。一八六七年南部张定和张绢的游击队，一八七四年，特别是一八八四年的抵抗运动，自一八八四年至一八九六年由潘廷逢领导进行了十二年的斗争，后来由黄花探领导、一直继续到第一次世界大战前夕的斗争，一九○七年中部的抵抗运动，一九一四—一九一五年间的边和起义，一九一六年的顺化起义以及一九一七年的太原起义等等，所有这些运动都证明了越南人民为了自己的自由和民族的独立，曾经进行了可歌可泣的斗争。但是在那个时期，仍旧是由国王和封建官僚掌握国家的事务，他们所执行的罪恶政策是一贯背叛人民的，人民的愿望不能得到实现。
    伟大的十月革命敲响了钟声，给被压迫的人民争取解放的斗争以新的推动。年青的苏维埃政权很快就解决了沙皇政府统治下的旧殖民地问题，使被压迫的人民恢复了自由。这在所有亚洲的殖民地和半殖民地国家里产生了巨大的反响。获得胜利的马克思和列宁的学说，给所有这些国家的人民指出了解放的道路。
    在越南，马克思列宁主义的党是在一九三○年一月安沛起义以后诞生的。在这次起义以后，资产阶级失去了它对民族解放运动的一切影响；工人阶级和农民劳动群众被组织在自己的党内。党成了反帝国主义革命的唯一领导者。一九三○年九月，在中部的三个县内，建立了第一个人民政权。帝国主义者以空前未有的残暴手段，把这个运动压制下去了。但是从一九四○年以后，在越南的北部、中部和南部，武装斗争又重新组织起来了，其目的是反对法国殖民主义者和日本帝国主义者。这些反抗运动尽管还是被压了下去，但终于成为星星之火，在五年以后，引起了革命的爆发，摧毁了外国在越南的统治。
    一九四一年五月，民族统一战线——“越南独立同盟”诞生了。这是我国民族解放运动史上从来未有的最广泛的组织。以党为主导力量的民族统一战线，动员并组织了各游击队；在整个第二次世界大战期间，这些游击队和盟军并肩作战，打击法西斯侵略者。
    英勇的苏联军队所取得的胜利，首先是对希特勒德国的胜利，继而对日本帝国主义的胜利，大大有助于一九四五年八月十九日越南总起义的成功，而越南民主共和国就在九月二日宣布成立。
    在法西斯主义势必崩溃的有利的国际形势下，八月革命之所以能获得胜利，是因为它具备了三个条件，殖民地国家进行任何反帝革命所必不可少的条件，那就是：工人阶级的领导，组织一个广泛的反帝的民族阵线和武装斗争。
    自此以后，我国的历史展开了辉煌的一页。越南人民得到自由。八月革命不仅使越南人民摆脱了殖民主义者的枷锁和帝国主义者的一切其他奴役，并且消除了封建地主和封建官僚的可怕的剥削。劳动人民第一次成为自己的主人，成为决定国家命运的主人。他们开始埋头苦干，制止那可怕的饥荒景象，因为在帝国主义统治的最后几个月里（从一九四四年底至一九四五年初）死于饥荒的人已有二百万之多。他们竭力医治我国从灾难重重的奴役制度所遗留下来的创伤。这种奴役制度一直维持到本世纪的中叶。他们选出了国民大会，开始建设了人民政权，并且采取了各种措施，来消灭殖民统治所遗留下来的文盲和愚昧。
    但是法国殖民主义者老是想要恢复他们的压迫统治。他们把我们的和平态度当作软弱。他们在英、美帝国主义者的鼓励和支持之下，与蒋介石匪帮朋比为奸，九月二十三日在西贡向越南人民进攻，然后又企图进入北部。接着，法国殖民主义者背弃了他们在一九四六年三月六日的初步协定和九月十四日的临时协定上所承担的义务，发动了海防的大屠杀，占据了谅山，到处挑衅，一直继续到十二月十九日我们人民开始向侵略者展开全国抗战时为止。
    全国人民响应党和民主政府的号召，大家团结得像一个人一样，来保护党、保护八月革命的胜利果实。
    爱国战争开始的时候，物质条件对越南人民是不利的：饥荒仍然蔓延，法国殖民主义者和日本帝国主义者的走狗充斥各处，人民军只是在以后的战争过程中才建立起来……当时，法国远征军在军事上的优势似乎是肯定了的；敌人估计到我们的这一切困难，以为这样他们就可以很快击溃我们的年青军队，摧毁我们的民主政府。但是事实的演变恰恰相反，证明他们的估计是大错而特错了。
    凭借着美帝国主义者的支援，敌人不久便发动了全面战争，向越南人民进攻。但是，越南人民在党和政府的领导之下，集中了一切力量，组成一个天衣无缝的战斗整体。他们尽量加强游击战争，把游击战争深深地推进到敌人占领区的后方。他们巩固了自己的根据地，并且在人民热情支持之下建立了自己的军队。人民军同游击队密切地联系，英勇地作战，在好几个战线上消灭了敌人的部队。一九四七年的秋天和冬天，在越中边境上的越北，一九五○年最后几个月，在北部中游地区、红河三角洲，和平和巴位，一九五一年在黑水江沿岸，一九五二年在越南南方，一九五三年在莱州，最后于一九五四年五月六日，即日内瓦会议开幕的前夕，在奠边府取得了决定性的胜利。这个胜利大大影响了日内瓦会议工作的进行，促成了日内瓦协议的签订。这个协议保证：在承认越南、柬埔寨和老挝人民民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那的和平。
    同时，殖民主义者和帝国主义者的政治阴谋，例如：“以战养战”，“用越南人打越南人”，帝国主义者的奴仆们为了欺骗我国人民所扮演的“独立和民主”、“土地改革”等滑稽戏，这一切都遭到可耻的失败。
    最后，在这整个时期，党和政府致力于建设和发展越南民主共和国的经济、财政和文化。首先，根据“耕者有其田”的原则，开始实行了土地改革。由于竭力维持、发展小型工业和手工业中不可缺少的部门，居民和军队得到了各种最需要的用品的供应。党和政府一方面鼓励大米和其他粮食作物的生产，同时进行改良灌溉和防洪的工作，并且保证交通运输得到必要的发展。
    国民经济中的国营部分，国家银行和商业机构都建立起来了，并且继续得到发展。国民教育、农民和士兵的教育以及扫除文盲的斗争，尽管是在困难的条件下进行的，但都获得了显著的成就。
    因此，在所有这些军事、政治、经济领域内，我们年青的共和国都光荣地经过了战争的考验。正如列宁教导我们说，一个民族的一切品质应该在战争中表现出来。
    人民和军队团结在党和政府的周围，他们对党的热爱，在道德上和政治上的团结一致，帮助我们克服了极大的困难，经历了考验，并且在政治、经济和军事方面为胜利准备了种种条件。
    对正义事业必定胜利的不可动摇的信心，鼓舞了我国人民的勇气。我们的士兵、我们的游击队员和我们的干部，从丰富多采的民族运动史中所吸取的道德品质和战斗品质，帮助我们年青的军队完成了许多历史性的事迹；这些事迹使他们的旗帜永远光辉。
    中苏两国人民和军队宝贵的典范，不断地鼓舞了我们的人民和我们的战士，并帮助我们培养出自己的英雄。
    法国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民曾给我们以极宝贵的帮助。在抗战极端艰苦的日子里，他们和我们站在一起；当和平恢复了的时候，他们也和我们一道欢乐。
    民主共和国已经取得了胜利，这种胜利是不会消失的，因为这是被压迫者对压迫者的胜利，自由对奴役的胜利。我国人民摆脱了再度被奴役的苦难。八月革命的成果：和平、统一、独立和民主已经得到保障并且日益巩固。
    印度支那已经在承认越南、柬埔寨和老挝三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上恢复了和平。
    一九五四年日内瓦会议给我们带来了和平。但是当我国仍然被北纬十七度上临时分界线所分裂的时候，这个和平是不巩固的。加上南越当局和它的保护者所表示的横蛮态度，给这刚刚才有一年之久的和平带来了极严重的威胁。
    的确如此，虽然日内瓦协议的军事阶段已得到相当令人满意的结束，使北越全部领土获得解放，但是由于吴庭艳政府不断的阻挠，第二阶段，即于一九五六年通过普选恢复越南统一的工作还没有开始进行。
    南越当局对居住在我国南部的同胞们，对所有的爱国人士与和平人士，进行了凶暴的迫害：在一年之内，它制造三百多个案件，这不但是犯罪的行为，而且破坏了日内瓦协议。至少有四千个爱国人士被杀死或打伤，一万九千多人被逮捕。除了这些恐怖行为外，吴庭艳政府还死心蹋地追随美国的政策，一心要把南越变为美国的殖民地和军事基地，纳入东南亚侵略集团的活动范围之内。尽管有这些行为，吴庭艳还是恬不知耻地自命为越南和平、民主和独立的“勇士”。
    这样的形势决定了民主共和国政府的任务。第一个目标是彻底地、全部地实施日内瓦协议，这就是说，立即召开越南南北双方协商会议。这是准备进行自由普选，统一国家的第一步。因此，和平与统一全国是我们当前的主要要求。
    其次，我们必须医治战争的创伤，逐步提高我国人民的生活水平，并建设我们的新生活，使大家过着真正自由、民主的生活。为了这个目的，一方面我们必须重建国民经济：农业、手工业、运输业和工业。自从我国人民过着和平生活以来，他们就勇敢地沿着这条道路前进。但是我们的工作还很繁重，例如：使荒芜的土地恢复耕种，修复堤坝、防止水灾，建筑灌溉系统、防止旱灾和饥馑。另一方面，我们应该在提高劳动生产率的基础上，逐步提高越南工人的福利。
    鉴于我们从战争、殖民主义和封建制度继承下来的破烂情形，这些任务是沉重的和复杂的。但是兄弟国家的援助大大地增加了完成这些任务的可能性，使我们满怀信心地瞻望着充满胜利的未来。的确是这样，由于越南政府代表团七月间同苏联和中华人民共和国政府领袖们会谈的结果，苏联和中国已经决定在今后数年中给我国一笔援助，总额计一万五千三百亿越币。其他人民民主国家也将对我们的恢复工作给予宝贵的援助。这种援助将供给我们物资、机器和技术人员。越南的经济和文化各部门将要从此得到很多好处。
    这种大公无私的、无条件的、有利于我国人民的援助，同帝国主义者所理解的“援助”，完全不同。帝国主义者一向是想通过他们的“援助”来达到剥削和奴役的目的。臭名昭著的马歇尔计划便清楚地证明了这一点。凡是马歇尔计划的“受惠国”都渐渐丧失了自己的主权。
    越南民主共和国在同其他国家的关系方面所采取的政策，是很明显很清楚的，那就是和平与友好关系的政策。这个政策的基础是中印两国总理联合声明和中缅两国总理联合声明中所宣布的五项原则，即：互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处。万隆会议特别证明了这五项原则已经得到亚非舆论界各方面的拥护。
    我们特别希望同我们的邻国，如柬埔寨和老挝，维持和平的关系。至于法国，我们仍然认为，在绝对平等和互利的条件下，首先是在相互信任和真诚合作的条件下，我们是可以和法国缔结特殊的经济和文化关系的。
    当此建国十周年纪念之际，如果我国人民回顾已走过的道路，他们是应该感到骄傲的。但是同时也应该掉转头来，特别是展望未来，看看还有什么要做的。我们面对的是一个政治斗争，这个斗争是困难的，长期的，而且是复杂的。然而，如果我们耐心、坚定、审慎，如果我们的党和民族阵线继续实行久经考验过的批评和自我批评的原则，那末，可以保证我们一定会得到完全的胜利。
    在这十年当中，和平、民主、社会主义阵营已获得巨大的进步。苏联抵抗法西斯侵略者获得了辉煌的胜利；它在共产主义建设和争取和平与缓和国际局势的政策方面已取得了重大的成就。人民民主国家在政治上和经济上日益巩固。中国革命的胜利使六亿人民获得了解放，他们以同一步伐向着幸福的目标前进。朝鲜人民在中国人民志愿军兄弟般的支援之下，胜利地击退了李承晚匪帮、美国和它的十五个仆从国家的侵略军。越南人民在法国殖民者所强加于他们的战争中已得到了胜利，在日内瓦赢得了和平、和平的力量日益增长，和平的阵地日益巩固。所有这一切胜利都鼓舞了我国人民，使他们对我国光辉灿烂的未来，对我们的事业的必将胜利，怀着无限的信心。
    尽管前面有许多困难，有许多障碍，我们仍然抱着胜利者的信心，以胜利者的姿态向前迈进！（附图片）
