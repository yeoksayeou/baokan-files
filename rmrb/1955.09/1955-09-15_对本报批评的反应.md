Responses to the Newspaper's Criticism

    All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives writes: We sincerely accept the criticism made by the People's Daily editorial on August 17 regarding our work on the resettlement of demobilized construction servicemen. Regarding this work, before the State Council's decision was announced, we had drafted instructions for lower-level cooperatives based on the spirit of the meeting convened by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. However, it has been almost two months now, and the board of directors has not yet discussed and issued them, causing some cooperatives to fail to actively and conscientiously implement the State Council's decision. In order to correct this error, we have revised the original draft instructions and will now issue them to the supply and marketing cooperatives of each province and city. We will order all levels of cooperatives to conduct an in-depth review of erroneous attitudes such as discrimination, exclusion, and refusal to employ in the work of resettling demobilized construction servicemen; in the future, they must actively resettle demobilized construction servicemen under the leadership of the Party committee, prioritize demobilized construction servicemen as the first objects of employment, and set a deadline for each province and city supply and marketing cooperative to submit specific plans for resettling demobilized construction servicemen to the provincial Party committee and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.

    对本报批评的反应
    中华全国供销合作总社来信：八月十七日人民日报社论对我社安置复员建设军人的工作提出了批评，我们诚恳地接受这一批评。对于这一工作，本来在国务院的决议公布之前，我们就根据内务部召开的会议的精神，草拟了对下级社的指示，但一直到现在将达两个月之久，理事会尚未讨论发出，致使某些合作社没能积极认真地贯彻执行国务院的决议。为了纠正这个错误，我们已把原指示草稿加以修改，即下达各省、市供销社，责令各级社对于在安置复员建设军人工作中的歧视排斥、拒绝录用等错误态度进行一次深入的检查；今后必须在党委领导下积极安置复员建设军人，把复员建设军人列为录用人员的第一位对象，并限期让各省、市供销社提出安置复员建设军人的具体计划报告省委和中华全国供销合作总社。
