Strengthen the Late-Stage Management of Sugar Crops
Chen Songtao

This spring, major sugarcane producing areas suffered unprecedented frost damage. After the frost damage, they were hit by natural disasters such as drought and insect pests. These disasters have seriously affected the completion of this year's sugarcane planting area. In Sichuan Province, the area of sugarcane planting reduced due to frost damage to sugarcane seedlings was approximately 40,000 mu, and the area reduced due to drought and seedling shortages was approximately 60,000 mu. In Suiqi County, Guangdong Province, sugarcane in District 1 and District 3 died in large areas due to stem borers and drought. Due to the impact of natural disasters, sugarcane growth is poor, and farmers' enthusiasm for production is low. According to a survey of three villages in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, by the end of June, farmers had applied 44 percent less ammonium sulfate and 45 percent less cake fertilizer to sugarcane fields than last year, and the application of farm manure had not increased either. Moreover, 72 percent of the sugarcane fields were intercropped with grain crops. At the same time, the actual planting area of ​​sugar beet in many areas this year is still slightly short of the national plan due to pests and diseases. The above situation shows that tapping the potential of sugar production and actively increasing the yield of sugar crops is an urgent task for this production.

The sugarcane harvest period is generally after November, and September is still the main growing period for sugarcane. Strengthening field management of sugarcane fields during this period will have a certain effect on increasing yield per unit area. Some rural workers and farmers believe that there is no more work to be done in sugarcane fields now. This idea is wrong.

It is now the typhoon season. Sugarcane producing areas along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong should pay special attention to "high soil cultivation" in sugarcane field operations to stabilize the plants and reduce lodging. In areas with the habit of "tying leaves" and "ending" to prevent wind, farmers should be mobilized to do so as soon as possible. Appropriately removing the dry leaves of sugarcane plants can reduce the windward surface. Irrigating paddy sugarcane fields to soak the soil can prevent the sugarcane plants from being blown down by the wind. These experiences can be tried according to local conditions. During this period, sugarcane producing areas along the coast must pay attention to listening to typhoon forecasts and mobilize the masses to do a good job in wind prevention.

Sugarcane pests such as cotton aphids, stem borers, and scarab beetles have occurred in various places. Scarab beetles occurred in large numbers in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province in May, June, and July. Mutual aid teams in Jindaixiang Township, District 9, Ziyang County inspected 15.5 mu of sugarcane fields, and 9.9 mu were found to be infested with cotton aphids. Generally, each leaf had 50 to 200 insects, and the most had more than 1,000 insects per leaf. Some rural workers and farmers are not highly vigilant against insect pests. They blindly believe that "last winter was particularly cold, and there may be fewer or no cotton aphids this year." This kind of paralysis is very dangerous. Cotton aphid is the main pest in the later stage of sugarcane growth and is the most harmful. In 1954 alone, Neijiang County lost sugarcane worth a total of 1 million yuan due to cotton aphid infestation. If these pests can be controlled when they first occur, it will require less labor and yield greater results. If they are allowed to spread, it will not only be difficult to control, but will also cause great losses.

According to past experience, sugarcane in high and dry areas is most susceptible to autumn drought. In Guangxi Province in 1953 and 1954, sugarcane production decreased by about 20% because sugarcane farmers did not pay attention to autumn drought resistance. This year, these areas should pay attention to drought prevention.

In order to strive to complete this year's sugar crop production plan, in addition to actively guiding farmers to implement the above measures, harvesting methods must also be improved during harvesting operations to increase the harvest amount. According to rough calculations, harvesting sugarcane using the low-cutting method can increase the yield by 250 to 400 jin per mu, and harvesting the old sugarcane head (the last year) by pulling it out can increase the yield by 400 to 800 jin per mu. If low-cutting and pulling out the old sugarcane head are fully implemented in key provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Sichuan, sugarcane production can be increased by more than 10 million dan, equivalent to the yield of 200,000 mu of sugarcane fields. In terms of sugar beet harvesting, the harvesting and storage methods should also be improved. According to the experience of Heilongjiang and Jilin, the loss of sugar beet due to crude harvesting methods and improper storage before sale accounts for about 7% of the yield. It can be seen that in harvesting sugar crops, careful harvesting and attention to storage are very important measures to increase production.

Strengthening late-stage field management of sugar crops and increasing the yield of sugar crops is not only beneficial to the country but also beneficial to farmers. Staff and farmers in areas where sugar crops are grown should recognize the significance of doing a good job in this work and strive to strengthen late-stage management of sugar crops.

    加强糖料作物的后期管理工作
    陈松涛
    今春各主要产蔗区都受到了数十年来未有的冻害，在冻害以后又遭受干旱、虫害等自然灾害。这些灾害严重地影响到今年甘蔗种植面积的完成。四川省因蔗苗冻损减少的甘蔗种植面积约四万亩，因干旱缺苗减少的面积约六万多亩。广东省遂溪县一区、三区因螟虫和干旱为害，甘蔗大片死亡。由于遭受自然灾害侵袭，甘蔗生长不良，蔗农的生产情绪低落。据四川省内江县三个村的调查，到六月底，农民施在蔗田的硫酸铵较去年减少了百分之四十四，饼肥减少了百分之四十五，农家肥料的施用也没有增加；并且有百分之七十二的蔗田都间作了粮食作物。同时，今年许多地区的甜菜因病虫为害，实种面积同国家计划也还稍有距离。上述情况说明，挖掘糖料生产的潜力，积极提高糖料作物产量，是目前这项生产的紧迫任务。
      甘蔗的收获期一般在十一月以后，九月还是甘蔗的主要生长期，在这一期间加强蔗田的田间管理对提高单位面积产量是有一定作用的。有些农村工作人员和农民认为现在甘蔗田已没有什么工作好做了。这种想法是错误的。
    目前已到台风季节，福建、广东等沿海甘蔗产区，在蔗田作业中要特别注意“高培土”，使植株稳固，减少倒伏；有“结叶”、“结束”防风习惯的地区，应动员农民及早进行。适当剥除蔗株枯叶可以减少挡风面。水田蔗田经过灌水湿透土壤，可以使蔗株不致被风吹折断。这些经验可以因地制宜地试用。这一期间，沿海甘蔗产区必须注意收听台风预报，动员群众做好防风工作。
    绵蚜虫、螟虫、金龟子等甘蔗害虫，各地已有发生。四川省内江县五、六、七月份曾大量发生金龟子；资阳县九区金带乡互助组检查了十五点五亩甘蔗田，有九点九亩发生绵蚜，一般每片叶有虫五十到二百个，最多的每片叶上有虫一千个以上。有些农村工作人员和农民防虫的警惕性还不高，他们盲目地认为“去年冬天特别冷，今年绵蚜虫可能少些或没有”。这种麻痹思想是非常危险的。绵蚜是甘蔗生长后期的主要害虫，为害最烈。一九五四年仅内江一县即因绵蚜虫为害损失总值一百万元的甘蔗。这些害虫若能在刚发生时进行防治，花工少，收效大；如果让它蔓延开来，不但防治困难，而且将会造成很大损失。
    根据历年的情况看，高、旱地区的甘蔗是最容易受到秋旱的。广西省一九五三年和一九五四年，由于蔗农没有注意秋季抗旱工作，甘蔗约减产二成。今年这些地区应该重视防旱工作。
    争取完成今年糖料作物产量计划，除了积极领导农民贯彻上述措施外，还必须在收获作业中改进收割方法，提高收获量。根据粗略计算：用低砍方法收割甘蔗每亩可增收二百五十斤至四百斤，拔收宿根头（最后一年的）每亩可增收四百至八百斤。如果在广东、广西、福建、四川等重点省全面推行低砍和拔收宿根头，就可增产甘蔗一千万担以上，相当二十万亩蔗田的产量。在甜菜的收获方面也应改进收获和保管的方法。据黑龙江、吉林等的经验，甜菜因收获方法的粗放和在收获后出售前的保管不当而损失的约占产量的百分之七。由此可见，在收获糖料作物上，做到精细收获，注意保管是十分重要的增产措施。
    加强糖料作物的后期田间管理，提高糖料作物的产量不仅对国家有利，对农民也是有利的，种植糖料作物地区的工作人员和农民，应该认识做好这一工作的意义，努力加强糖料作物的后期管理。
