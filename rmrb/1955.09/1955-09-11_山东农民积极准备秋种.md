To ensure timely sowing of wheat, various areas of Shandong are actively preparing for autumn planting. In the Heze, Liaocheng, Jining, Tai'an, and Linyi regions, 30% to 50% of the autumn stubble land has already been plowed, with many counties having plowed over 80%. Many agricultural production cooperatives have completed their autumn plowing. In the Linyi, Changwei, and Jiaozhou regions, 50% to 60% of the early autumn stubble has been moisture-retained and drought-protected through methods such as harrowing and cultivation. In Zou County, 23 agricultural production cooperatives and 110 mutual aid teams in the tenth district have helped 161 households without labor power to cultivate 1,749 mu of land, solving the difficulty of plowing for those lacking livestock and labor. In terms of fertilizer preparation, the amount of fertilizer applied will be increased compared to last year. In Yinan and Junan counties, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased by 200 jin compared to last year. Wheat seeds are also being prepared. According to incomplete statistics from thirteen counties in the Tai'an and Jiaozhou regions, the state has already reserved more than 6,330,000 jin of improved seeds. Ju County has reserved 590,000 jin of wheat seeds, and the germination rate has been found to be good after testing. At the same time, mass exchange of improved seeds has also begun. In Xintai Township, Yexian County, fifteen farmer households have exchanged more than 3,000 jin of "Large-Grain Semi-Awn" improved seeds. (Sun Wenlin)

    山东农民积极准备秋种
    为保证小麦适时播种，山东各地积极准备秋种。菏泽、聊城、济宁、泰安、临沂等专区的秋茬地已耕百分之三十至五十，其中有不少县已耕到百分之八十以上，许多农业生产合作社已秋耕结束。临沂、昌潍，胶州等专区有百分之五十至六十的早秋茬都通过耙、耘等方法进行了保墒防旱。邹县十区二十三个农业生产合作社和一百一十个互助组，已帮助一百六十一户无劳力户耕地一千七百四十九亩，解决了无畜力和无劳动力的耕种困难。在肥料的准备上，施肥量将比去年有所增加。沂南、莒南等县每亩施肥量比去年增加二百斤。麦种也正在准备，据泰安、胶州两专区十三个县的不完全统计，国家已储备良种六百三十三万余斤。莒县已储备麦种五十九万斤，经检验结果发芽率良好。同时，群众性的良种互换工作也已开始进行，掖南县一区邢台乡十五户农民已换“大粒半芒”良种三千余斤。（孙文林）
