Agricultural Production Cooperatives Achieve Universal Bumper Harvests

    The crops of the agricultural cooperative are all good
    At the end of August, the Antong Township in Huangdu District, Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, organized a visiting team to visit the Lighthouse No. 3 Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangpu Village, Antong Township. Most of the visiting members were mutual aid team members. As soon as they ran to the edge of the field in the cooperative's cultivated area, they were attracted by the dark green late rice. Chen Xinqiu, the head of the Lighthouse No. 3 Cooperative, accompanied everyone to visit the fields one by one. The visiting members kept asking him questions. He told everyone: "This cooperative has been established for less than a year, and it has already achieved a bumper harvest in the summer harvest this year. The late rice is growing particularly well." He said with a smile: "Once the cooperative is organized, every field becomes better, and every field can increase production."
    The visiting team walked to a field at "Hedongkou". The rice seedlings in this field were divided into two parts. One half of the rice seedlings was yellow and short, while the other half was black and tall. It turned out that the yellow half, about twenty acres, belonged to Tang Boxing, a farmer working individually. In the past, his production always exceeded the five mu and five fen of Chen Daoyun, a poor farmer on this side. Since Chen Daoyun joined the cooperative, after the cooperative's processing and improvement, the rice seedlings now exceed those of Tang Boxing. Chen Xinqiu then led the visiting team to the bank of a three-mu field. The crops in this field did not look very good. Chen Xinqiu introduced: "This field used to be wasteland. After the cooperative was organized, we took it over and planted it, adding enough fertilizer, and that's why we have today's crops!" Everyone laughed when they heard what the head of the cooperative said, and they admired the cooperative for its strength and the fact that "the fields have also turned over."

### 农业合作社的庄稼块块好

专栏：农业生产合作社普遍大丰收

    农业合作社的庄稼块块好
    八月底，江苏嘉定县黄渡区安东乡组织了参观队，前往该乡双浦村灯塔第三农业合作社进行参观。参观的队员大都是互助组员。他们一跑到社里耕作区的田埂上，就被那一片墨绿色的晚稻吸引住了。灯塔第三社社长陈心球陪同大家逐块逐块地进行参观，参观队员们不断提出问题来问他，他告诉大家：“这个社办起来还不到一年，今年夏收就已得到丰收，晚稻长得格外好。”他笑着说：“一组织合作社，块块田变好了，块块田都能增产了。”
    参观队走到“河东口”一块田，这块田的稻苗分成了两片。一半稻苗又黄又矮，另一半却长得又乌又高。原来黄的那一半约二十来亩是单干农民唐伯兴的，过去他的生产总是超过这边贫农陈道云的五亩五分田，自从陈道云入社后，经过社里加工改良，现在稻苗超过了唐伯兴的田了。陈心球又领着参观队到了一块三亩头的田岸上，看上去这块田的庄稼并不怎么好，陈心球介绍说：“这块田原来是荒田，组织了社后，我们接收下来种，加足了肥料，才有今天的庄稼！”大家听了社长这么一谈，都笑了起来，心里头佩服合作社人多力量强，真是“田也翻了身”。
