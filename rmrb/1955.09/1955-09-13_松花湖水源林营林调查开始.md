    Songhua Lake Water Source Forest Management Survey Begins

    In accordance with the national forestry survey and design work policy, and combined with the specific conditions of the province, Jilin Province will complete the Songhua Lake water source forest management survey and design work within the country's first Five-Year Plan. This year's survey task is 160,000 hectares, and it is planned to be completed by the end of October. As early as the beginning of May, members of the Third Team of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Survey Team began working in the upper reaches of Songhua Lake. During the survey, the team members launched a labor emulation campaign, which improved work efficiency. By mid-August, they had completed 150,000 hectares of the task. Therefore, the entire team is preparing to investigate an additional 60,000 hectares in addition to the original plan and to complete it half a month ahead of schedule. In this way, the entire team can save the country more than 3,000 yuan in expenses.

    Songhua Lake is located in the middle section of the Songhua River; it is a man-made lake built after the Fengman Hydropower Station was built. Large and small rivers around the lake converge into the lake. Among them, more than a dozen larger rivers have been particularly seriously harmed by floods over the years. Every rainy season, mountain floods break out, and cultivated land near the slopes is completely washed away, causing serious soil erosion. This not only greatly harms agricultural production in the area along the lake, but also affects agricultural production in the surrounding fourteen counties. The successful construction of the Songhua Lake water source forest will greatly reduce these disasters.

    松花湖水源林营林调查开始
    吉林省根据全国林业调查设计工作的方针，并结合本省具体情况，要在国家第一个五年计划内，完成松花湖水源林营林调查设计工作。今年的勘查任务是十六万公顷，计划在十月末结束。早在五月初，吉林省林业调查队第三队队员就在松花湖上游地区开始工作。在勘查中，由于队员们开展劳动竞赛，提高了工作效率，在八月中旬就完成了十五万公顷的任务，因此全队准备除原计划外再调查六万公顷，并要比原定日期提前半个月完成。这样全队即可为国家节省经费开支三千多元。
    松花湖位于松花江的中段；是丰满水电站筑成后的人造湖。沿湖周围大小河流都向湖里汇集，其中十几条较大的河流历年洪水为害特别严重，每逢雨季山洪暴发，靠近山坡耕地全被冲毁，造成严重的土壤流失，这不仅使沿湖一带的农业生产受到很大的危害，而且影响到周围十四个县的农业生产。松花湖水源林营造成功后将大大减轻这些灾害。
