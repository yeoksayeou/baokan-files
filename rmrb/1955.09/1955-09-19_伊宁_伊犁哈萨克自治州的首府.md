Yining – Capital of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture
Xiao Du

The brilliant sunshine illuminates the perpetually snow-capped peaks of the Tianshan Mountains. The banks of the Ili River are covered in the dense shade of green trees. The Lombardy poplars grow even taller. The orchards are even more lush and verdant. In this most beautiful season of the year, I came to the border city of Yining in the motherland.

The Cradle of the National Revolution of the Three Districts

Yining is located in the center of the Ili River Valley plain, close to the Soviet border. This is a multi-ethnic city with a population of over 90,000. All thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang have residents here.

Yining is a city with a glorious history of revolutionary struggle. It was once the cradle of the famous National Revolution of the Three Districts in Xinjiang. In 1944, the people of all ethnic groups in the Ili, Tacheng, and Altai districts, unable to endure the cruel oppression and bloody rule of the Kuomintang bandits, finally launched a heroic armed revolution. In a short period of several months, this armed force completely annihilated the Kuomintang bandits' army stationed here, which possessed superior equipment, and overthrew the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang bandits in the Ili area. The headquarters of the Three Districts Revolution was located here at that time. Now, it is the capital of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. Under the glorious illumination of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of ethnic equality, the relationship between the various ethnic groups living in Yining City has undergone fundamental changes. In the past, the people of all ethnic groups living in this city hardly interacted with each other, not only rarely interacting on weekdays, but also not visiting each other during festivals. A Tatar woman said, "Before liberation, I lived in Yining for nine years and never even entered a Uyghur person's house." This is a vivid illustration of the ethnic relations in the old Yining City.

But in today's Yining, we see a completely different scene: people of all ethnic groups working together in various factories, working in various government offices, and even jointly organizing agricultural and handicraft production cooperatives. They live together, work together, help each other, and are harmonious and seamless. For example, in the Yining Municipal People's Government, we see cadres from thirteen ethnic groups; in the Yining People's Power Plant, there are workers including nine ethnic groups. The earliest "Victory" shoe production cooperative established in Yining City was formed by handicraft workers from seven ethnic groups. Now, it is a very common and ordinary phenomenon for people of all ethnic groups to interact closely on a daily basis and to congratulate each other during festivals. For many years, the working people of all ethnic groups have jointly built this city, and now they are living together more and more closely and harmoniously, jointly building and transforming this city.

A Green City

When guests from afar arrive in Yining, their first impression is: many trees. Standing high and overlooking the entire city, what you see is simply a green sea of trees. On both sides of many streets and canals in the urban area, there are rows of densely planted poplars, elms, willows, and locust trees, with lush foliage everywhere, giving people a cool and comfortable feeling.

A wide, poplar-lined avenue leads the new arrivals straight to the bustling city center. On the tree-lined road, a constant stream of streetcars – "Six Sticks" (a simple and light four-wheeled carriage) – clatter along, ringing their bells. Occasionally, one can see Kazakhs on horseback passing through the streets, hurrying towards the suburbs, with large packages of daily necessities purchased from the city on their backs. Even though it is summer, they still habitually wear their winter black cotton "chapan" and leather trousers. Their attire forms a stark contrast to the fluttering gauze skirts of the Uyghur and Russian girls passing by.

Indeed, the scenery of Yining City is very unique. In the urban area, Russian-style buildings among the green trees, the umbrella-shaped green roofs of Islamic mosques, the various and colorful ethnic costumes of pedestrians on the streets, as well as fruit stalls along the streets and the fragrant roast mutton..., the signs on many government offices and shops are written simultaneously in Han Chinese and Uyghur, Russian, or Kazakh, and two or three other ethnic languages. In general residential houses, there are green orchards and grape trellises; the orchards are planted with various fruit trees and flowers.

Yining City covers a large area, about ten kilometers long and wide. The entire city can be roughly divided into the old city and the new city. The old city is mainly a commercial area, with relatively narrow and irregular streets; the buildings are generally relatively short, old, and small; most of the shops have only one small storefront, and Uyghur merchants conduct transactions with customers across the low counter at the door.

The new city is the famous scenic and residential area. The streets are mostly in a "well" shape, relatively neat, wide, and straight. Most of the residential buildings are Russian-style bungalows. White walls, light blue and ultramarine painted doors and windows, paired with embroidered curtains and potted plants on the windowsills, are hidden among the green trees, looking very elegant and pleasing to the eye.

Connecting the new city and the old city is a very long street – Stalin Street. This is a major street in the entire city. The area surrounding Stalin Street is the lively and bustling city center.

A Prosperous New Look

Yining City has undergone great changes in recent years. Like many cities in the motherland's interior, both urban construction and various production and construction projects are becoming more prosperous and developing year by year.

In the urban area, new buildings are rising one after another among the green trees. There have also appeared some mechanized and semi-mechanized small-scale local and special product processing factories. The new school buildings are also increasing. In the past five years, the area of newly built and renovated buildings in the city has increased by about 25,000 square meters. Although Yining City has not yet started large-scale urban construction, people have already seen the prospects for its future development.

On a large open space at a crossroads in the middle of Stalin Street, a three-story building is being actively rushed to complete, and it can be completed by the end of this year. This is the future office building of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee. A comrade who understands the intention of the construction told me: in the future, there are plans to build a city center square here, and the streets in this area will also be expanded.

If the development and prosperity of cities in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture is mainly a concentrated reflection of the development and prosperity of the agricultural and pastoral economy, then this point is particularly evident in Yining City. Now is the harvest season for the rich agricultural and pastoral products on both sides of the Ili River, and Yining City is even more lively and prosperous. Every day, at the Ili River ferry, on the roads leading to the urban area and on the village roads, cars and horse-drawn carts loaded with wool, hides, grain, and other agricultural and pastoral local specialties, come and go in an endless stream from morning till night.

State-owned stores and cooperatives are particularly prosperous. Now the city's outlets have grown to sixty-six. In the department stores and cloth shops in the city center area around Stalin Street, customers are crowded all day long. Many Kazakh and Uyghur people would rather travel a long distance and squeeze into the outlets for half a day, even if they only buy a foot or half a foot of cloth. They say that the things in the state stores are good and cheap, and we can rest assured when we buy things there.

Yining is the city with the most developed handicrafts in Xinjiang. Now there are thirty-one types of handicrafts in Yining City, and the number of handicraft households has grown to more than 2,400. The main industries include ironwork, woodwork, carriages, rope spinning, brick kilns, leather, boots and shoes, sewing, oil pressing, galvanized iron, felt cylinders, felt, moxibustion, etc. The handicraft workers here are taking the road of organization. Since last year, the city has established three handicraft production cooperatives and twenty-four production groups. The largest private Liqun Company operated by Uyghur handicraft workers in Yining City has already implemented joint state-private ownership last year. The machine leather factory of this company produces "Hurumu" (a kind of fine leather), which is the best product in Xinjiang. The oil cowhide and oil horsehide produced by this factory are also very famous. The oil leather boots made of these two kinds of leather are waterproof and antiseptic, and are deeply loved by people of all ethnic groups and sell a lot.

The vigorous development of school education is another important symbol of Yining City's increasing prosperity. The Kazakh, Uyghur, Uzbek, Tatar, Russian, Mongolian, Han, and Hui ethnic groups here now each have their own middle school.

Happy People

With economic development, the lives of people of all ethnic groups are becoming happier and better day by day.

The lives of the residents of this border city are rich and colorful. During the day, people are engaged in intense production, work, and study in different positions; once dusk arrives, the city is brightly lit, and people begin to enjoy the joy of rest after a day of intense labor. In the People's Park, on the wide tree-lined road of Xishaozi in the quiet residential area, in the orchards of the exquisite Russian-style residences, in the open-air dance floor of the "Iskhak Bayk Club"..., everywhere are crowds of laughing people, as well as intermittent songs and the light and melodious tunes of the accordion and "Tanbor". The clubs and movie theaters are even more crowded with people. There are now nine movie theaters in the city, and watching movies is the most frequent and main entertainment for people.

If it is Sunday, the people of Yining City often like to go to the suburbs for picnics, hunting, or fishing by the Ili River. On holidays, you can also go a little further, to the scenic Guozigou and Sailimu Lake areas in the mountain pastoral areas to escape the heat, drink mare's milk, and enjoy the beauty of nature in the quiet valleys, vast grasslands, green lakes, verdant pine forests, as well as snow-capped mountains, flocks of sheep, and the yurts of Kazakh herdsmen, bathed in the sunshine.

After I stayed in Yining for a period of time, I deeply missed this city. Its joyful, vigorous atmosphere of youth life is so strongly infecting and exciting me. Every day I walk in this city, seeing every excited face and smiling eyes of the fraternal ethnic people here, it seems that they are telling me and letting me tell the people all over the country: we are advancing with the motherland!

    伊宁——伊犁哈萨克自治州的首府
    萧渡
    灿烂的阳光，照耀着终年积雪的天山高峰。伊犁河两岸，到处笼罩着绿树的浓荫。钻天杨长得更高了。果树园子也越发苍翠茂密。在这一年之中最美好的季节，我来到了祖国边疆的伊宁城。
    三区民族革命的摇篮
    伊宁位于伊犁河谷平原的中心，紧靠着苏联的边境。这是一个拥有九万多人口的多民族的城市。新疆的十三个民族这里都有它的居民。
    伊宁是一个具有光荣的革命斗争历史的城市。它曾经是著名的新疆三区民族革命的摇篮。一九四四年，伊犁、塔城、阿山三区各族人民由于不堪忍受国民党匪帮的残酷压迫和血腥统治，终于发动了英勇的武装革命。在短短的几个月内，这支武装力量就全部消灭了驻在这里的国民党匪帮拥有优势装备的军队，推翻了国民党匪帮在伊犁地区的反动政权。当时的三区革命司令部就设在这里。现在，它是伊犁哈萨克自治州的首府。在中国共产党民族平等政策的光辉照耀下，居住在伊宁城的各民族之间的关系，已经起了根本的变化。过去，住在这个城市里的各族人民，几乎是彼此“老死不相往来”的，不仅平日很少交往，就是逢年过节也不往来。有一个塔塔尔族的妇女说：“解放前我在伊宁住了九年，连一个维族人的房子也没进去过。”这是对旧的伊宁城各民族关系的生动说明。
    但在今天的伊宁，我们看到的完全是另一种情景：各族人民共同在各个工厂里劳动、在各个机关里工作，以至共同组织农业和手工业生产合作社。他们生活在一起、工作在一起，互助友爱，融洽无间。就如在伊宁市人民政府，我们看到有十三个民族的干部；在伊宁人民发电厂有包括着九个民族的工人。伊宁市最早成立的一个“胜利”靴鞋生产合作社，是由七个民族的手工业者参加组成的。现在，各族人民日常亲密地交往，逢年过节互相拜贺，已经是最普通、寻常的现象了。各族劳动人民多少年来在一起共同缔造了这个城市，如今他们正越来越亲密和睦地生活在一起，共同建设和改造着这个城市。
    绿色的城
    远方的客人来到伊宁，他得到的第一个印象便是：树多。站在高处?瞰全城，你的眼底简直是一片绿色的树海。市区内许多街道和水渠两旁，都成排地密密地栽着白杨、榆、柳和槐树，到处是浓荫，给人一种清凉、舒畅的感觉。
    一条宽阔的、白杨参天的林荫马路，把初来的客人，一直引向繁华的市中心区。林荫路上，川流不息的街车—“六根棍”（一种简单轻便的四轮马车），响着叮当的铃声来往奔驰。不时可以见着一些骑马的哈萨克人穿过街头，匆匆地向郊外走去；马背上捎着刚从城里买来的大包的日用品。虽然是夏天，他们还习惯地穿着过冬的黑色棉“袷袢”和皮裤子。他们的装束和走过身旁的维吾尔、俄罗斯族姑娘们的飘拂的纱裾，形成了强烈的对照。
    的确，伊宁城的风光是很别致的。市区内，绿树丛中的俄罗斯风格的房屋建筑、伊斯兰教礼拜寺伞盖形的绿色的楼顶、街头行人各色各样的、鲜艳的民族服装，以及沿街摆着的瓜果摊和发散着香味的烤羊肉……，这里的许多机关、商店门上的牌子，都同时写着汉文和维吾尔、俄罗斯或哈萨克等两三种民族文字。一般居民住宅内，都有绿荫荫的果园和葡萄架；果园里栽着各种果树和花草。
    伊宁城的范围很大，纵横都有约十公里长。整个城市大致可分为旧城区和新城区。旧城区主要是商业区，街道比较窄狭，也不规则；房屋建筑一般都比较矮小、古旧；商店大部分只有一间小铺面，维吾尔族商人们隔着当门的矮柜台同顾客进行交易。
    新城区就是著名的风景、住宅区。街道大都是“井”字形的，比较整齐、宽直。住宅建筑大部分是具有俄罗斯风格的平房。粉白的墙壁、淡蓝和蔚蓝色油漆的门窗，配着挑花的窗帘和窗台上的盆景，掩映在绿树丛中，看起来非常雅致和悦目。
    把新城区和旧城区连结起来的，是一条很长的大街—斯大林街。这是全城的一条主要街道。环绕着斯大林街的周围一带，就是热闹繁华的市中心区。
    繁荣的新面貌
    伊宁市这几年来有了很大的变化，它和祖国内地许多城市一样，无论城市建筑和各项生产建设，都在一年比一年繁荣和发展着。
    在市区内，新的建筑物一座接着一座在绿树丛中耸立起来。还出现了一些机械化和半机械化的小型的土、特产加工工厂。新的学校建筑也越来越多。五年来，全市新建和整修的房屋建筑面积已经增加了约两万五千平方公尺。虽然现在伊宁市还没有开始大规模的城市建设，但是人们已经看到了它未来发展的远景。
    在斯大林街中段一个十字街口的一大片空地上，有一座三层大楼正在积极赶修，今年年底可以落成。这是伊犁哈萨克自治州人民委员会未来的办公大楼。一个了解建筑意图的同志告诉我：将来这里计划修建一个市中心广场，这一带的街道也要扩展。
    如果说目前在伊犁哈萨克自治州的城市的发展和繁荣主要是农牧业经济发展和繁荣的集中反映，那末，这一点在伊宁城是看得特别明显的。现在正是富饶的伊犁河两岸农牧业产品的收获季节，伊宁城更显得热闹和繁荣了。每天，在伊犁河渡口，在通往市区的公路上和村道上，满载着羊毛、皮张、粮食和其他农牧业土特产品的汽车、马车，从早到晚络绎不绝。
    国营商店和合作社，生意特别兴隆，现在全城门市部已经发展到六十六个了。在斯大林街一带市中心区的百货、布匹门市部里，更是整天挤满了顾客。许多哈萨克、维吾尔族人民就是买一尺半尺布，也宁愿跑很远的路到门市部去挤半天。他们说，国家商店里的东西，又好又便宜，到那里买东西我们放心。
    伊宁是全疆手工业最发达的城市。现在伊宁市的手工业共有三十一种行业，手工业户已发展到二千四百多户。主要的行业有铁工、木工、套具、纺绳、砖窑、皮革、靴鞋、缝纫、榨油、洋铁、毡筒、毡子、莫合烟等等。这里的手工业者正在走着组织起来的道路，去年以来全市已建立了三个手工业生产合作社、二十四个生产小组。过去伊宁市维吾尔族手工业者经营的最大的私营利群公司，已经在去年实行了公私合营。这个公司的机器皮革厂出产的
  “胡入木”（一种细皮），是全疆最好的产品。这个厂所产的油牛皮和油马皮也很著名。这两种皮子制成的油皮靴可以防水、防腐，深受各族人民喜爱，销售很多。
    学校教育事业的蓬勃发展，是伊宁市日益繁荣的另一个重要标志。这里的哈萨克、维吾尔、乌孜别克、塔塔尔、俄罗斯、蒙古、汉、回等族，现在都已分别有了一所自己的中学了。
    幸福的人民
    随着经济的发展，各族人民的生活也一天比一天过得幸福美好起来。
    这个边疆城市的居民们的生活是丰富多采的。白天，人们都在不同的岗位上进行着紧张的生产、工作和学习；一到黄昏，全城电灯通明，人们开始享受着一天紧张劳动之后的休息的愉快。在人民公园、在幽静的住宅区西沙河子一带宽坦的林荫路上、在精致的俄罗斯式的住宅的果园里、在“依斯哈克拜克俱乐部”的露天舞场……，处处是欢笑的人群，还有断断续续的歌声和手风琴、“弹波儿”的轻快、悠扬的调子。俱乐部、电影院门前更是挤满了人。现在全市共有九家电影院，看电影是人们经常的主要娱乐。
    如果是星期天，伊宁市的人常常爱到郊外去野游、打猎，或者到伊犁河畔去钓鱼。在假日还可以走得远一点，到风景区果子沟、赛里木湖一带山里牧区去避暑、喝马奶子，在那幽静的山谷、广阔的草原、碧绿的湖水、苍翠的松林以及雪山、羊群和哈萨克牧民的蒙古包的旁边，沐浴在阳光底下，享受大自然的美丽的湖光山色。
    当我在伊宁逗留了一个时期以后，我深深留恋起这个城市来了。它的欢乐、蓬勃的青春生活的气氛，是这样强烈地感染着我，激动着我。我每天在这个城市里走着，看到这里兄弟民族人民的每一张兴奋的脸和微笑的眼光，都好像在告诉我并让我向祖国各地的人民转告一句话：我们正在和祖国一起前进！（附图片）
