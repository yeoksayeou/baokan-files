    (Reported by this newspaper) The Shijiazhuang Special District Public Security Organs in Hebei Province, based on reports and exposures from the masses and after thorough investigation, have uncovered a counter-revolutionary assassination group that had infiltrated the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Special District. This counter-revolutionary group, under the guise of "doctors," deliberately created multiple major medical accidents. According to incomplete statistics, in a little over two years, they assassinated forty-three revolutionary soldiers, cadres, and civilians, of whom twenty-two were murdered, and twenty-one were crippled. The principal elements of this counter-revolutionary group, Wang Pichang, Liu Zheng, and Li Zongquan, have recently been arrested by the local public security organs according to the law.
    The counter-revolutionary Wang Pichang joined Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang as early as 1926 and served as a major and lieutenant colonel medical director in Chiang's bandit army. In 1944, he also served as the president of the pseudo-Shaanxi Tongchuan Mining Area Hospital and secretary of the Kuomintang district branch in the mine, participating in Chiang's bandit "Central Unification" secret service organization, actively developing secret service personnel, and collecting information about our side. At that time, he had already caused the death of eight workers through medical malpractice. In 1951, Wang Pichang, through private introduction, infiltrated the First People's Hospital of Shijiazhuang Special District and actively sought out counter-revolutionary elements to carry out sabotage activities. In 1952, during the "Three-Anti" campaign and grading, Wang Pichang learned that Liu Zheng, Li Zongquan, and others were counter-revolutionary elements with serious crimes, so he gathered them to form a counter-revolutionary group to carry out counter-revolutionary activities together.
    This group of counter-revolutionary elements, seizing on the weakness of the hospital director Zhang Zhengquan, who liked to be flattered, tried their best to compliment Zhang Zhengquan while pretending to be proactive and gaining his trust. Zhang Zhengquan was deceived and soon promoted Wang Pichang to deputy director of surgery. Wang Pichang then recommended his counter-revolutionary group members, surgical assistant Liu Zheng and laboratory technician Li Zongquan, to become doctors and director of the laboratory. At the same time, they took advantage of the loopholes in the hospital's personnel system to privately introduce six counter-revolutionary elements and cronies to work in the hospital.
    After the core members of this counter-revolutionary group seized important positions in the hospital, they began to carry out assassination activities boldly. They adopted vicious methods such as treating serious illnesses lightly, treating acute illnesses slowly, delaying treatment, using the wrong medicines, and performing the wrong surgeries to assassinate volunteers, Liberation Army soldiers, state organ personnel, and workers, farmers, and even women and children who came to the hospital for treatment. In December 1952, Qi Zhiwei, deputy secretary of the CPC Huolu County Committee, suffered from acute gastroenteritis and went to the hospital for treatment. The counter-revolutionary Wang Pichang casually examined him and lied that it was appendicitis, removing his appendix. After the surgery, knowing that the patient should not eat hard food, Wang Pichang did not tell the patient, nor did he stop the patient when he found him eating hard food, causing the patient's condition to worsen. When Comrade Qi Zhiwei was critically ill, the nurse reported to him several times, but he coldly said, "Report it again when he's dead." As a result, Comrade Qi Zhiwei was poisoned to death in this way. Another example is Su Jinshan, a military dependent of a volunteer soldier, who underwent a cesarean section. After the fetus was removed, Wang Pichang sutured the incision. It should have been sutured in three layers, but he deliberately only sutured it in two layers, and it was not very secure, causing the patient to die of internal bleeding. Yang Quanbin, a boy from the Fifth District of Hengshui County, was stabbed in the abdomen by scissors, and the omentum prolapsed. His life was in great danger, and he was rushed to the hospital overnight. Wang Pichang was already asleep at the time. The attending doctor explained the situation to him, but Wang lay in bed and replied indifferently, "We'll talk about it tomorrow." As a result, the child bled too much and died the next day before surgery could be performed. Song Junshuan of Ding County was a twenty-five-year-old young man who was hospitalized with a hernia. Wang Pichang diagnosed it as a hiatal hernia (more serious than a general hernia). During the surgery, Wang actually let Yuan Wenhai, an inexperienced dentist, and Li Shuncai, a nurse, try it. As a result, the surgery was not performed properly, and the patient died in less than three days. After his death, in order to cover up his crimes, Wang Pichang falsely reported that he died of so-called acute gastric dilatation to deceive the masses and the leadership. Jiang Dali, a woman from Xiyi Village, Gaoyi County, was hospitalized due to illness. Initially, Liu Zheng performed the surgery, and he deliberately cut the patient's bladder and right ureter. Wang Pichang then deliberately cut the left ureter, causing the patient to die without urination. Wang Pichang and others were even more hostile to revolutionary soldiers. Liu Chunchang, Gao Lincheng, Ma Chunhua, and Liu Fenghe, four soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Liu Fenghe, a volunteer soldier, were hospitalized for recuperation. The Hebei Provincial Health Department instructed them to be injected with streptomycin and penicillin for treatment, but Wang Pichang and Liu Zheng injected them with distilled water for more than half a year, so the illnesses of these four soldiers were not cured for a long time.
    This counter-revolutionary group also frequently spread rumors, disrupting the central work of various periods. When the Korean War broke out, Liu Zheng spread rumors, saying, "The Third World War will break out soon." Later, he spread rumors that the liberation of Taiwan would cause a world war and vigorously sabotaged the peace signature campaign and the issuance of new currency. Counter-revolutionary Li Zongquan openly said, "It would be better if Japan ruled for a few more years." The counter-revolutionary elements blatantly said to the Communist Party members in the hospital, "You are the Communist Party, I am the Kuomintang, so what you say goes." Because this counter-revolutionary group blatantly carried out criminal activities at will, many employees called this hospital "a den of reactionaries" and called surgery "a department of murder." The criminal activities of this counter-revolutionary group have long aroused the anger of hospital employees. Communist Party members Zhang Zhikun, Shi Xin, and others, as well as the masses, reported and exposed the crimes of this counter-revolutionary group to the CPC Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee and the public security organs. After investigation by the public security organs, the evidence was conclusive, and this counter-revolutionary group was finally uncovered. These counter-revolutionary elements will be severely punished by the law.

    石家庄专区公安机关根据群众的检举和揭发
    破获了打入医疗部门的反革命暗害集团
    本报讯　河北省石家庄专区公安机关，根据群众的检举和揭发，经过周密侦察，破获了打入石家庄专区第一人民医院的反革命暗害集团。这个反革命集团披着“医生”的外衣，故意制造多次重大的医疗事故。根据不完全统计，在两年多时间内暗害革命军人、干部和群众四十三人，其中被害死的二十二人，残废的二十一人。这个反革命集团的首要分子王丕昌、刘正、李宗泉，已于最近被当地公安机关依法逮捕。
    反革命分子王丕昌早在一九二六年就参加了蒋介石的国民党，曾任蒋匪少校、中校军医主任。一九四四年他又担任伪陕西铜川矿区医院院长兼该矿国民党区分部书记，参加了蒋匪“中统”特务组织，积极发展特务人员，搜集我方情报。那时，他就治死过八名工人。一九五一年，王丕昌经私人介绍混入石家庄专区第一人民医院后，就积极搜罗反革命分子，进行破坏活动。一九五二年，王丕昌在“三反”和评级中，得知刘正、李宗泉等都是有严重罪行的反革命分子，就纠合他们组成反革命集团，共同进行反革命活动。
    这批反革命分子，抓住医院院长张政权喜欢受人奉承的弱点，极力恭维张政权，同时伪装积极，骗取信任。张政权受了欺骗，不久就把王丕昌提拔为外科副主任。王丕昌又先后推荐其反革命集团分子外科医助刘正、化验员李宗泉等当了医师、化验室主任。同时利用医院人事制度不严的漏洞，私自介绍反革命分子和亲信六人到医院工作。
    这个反革命集团的骨干分子窃取了医院的重要职位以后，就开始大胆进行暗害活动。他们采用重病轻治、急症缓治、拖延不治、错用药品、错动手术等恶毒手段，暗害来医院治病的志愿军、解放军、国家机关工作人员和工人、农民以至妇女儿童。一九五二年十二月，中共获鹿县委副书记齐志伟患急性胃炎，到医院治疗。反革命分子王丕昌草率地检查了一下，就谎说是阑尾炎，动手术取出阑尾。动手术以后，明知病人不该吃硬东西，王丕昌却不告诉病人，发现病人吃硬东西也不制止，以致病人的病情恶化。到了齐志伟同志病重垂危时，护士几次向他报告，他冷冷地说：“死了再来报告。”结果齐志伟同志就这样被毒害死去。又如志愿军军属宿金深破腹取婴。取出胎儿以后由王丕昌缝合，本应缝合三层，他却故意只缝两层，并且极不牢固，以致病人患内出血死亡。衡水县第五区男孩杨全彬因被剪刀刺伤腹部，大网膜脱出，性命十分危急，连夜抬到医院。当时王丕昌已睡觉，门诊大夫向他说明这一情况，王躺在被窝里漠不关心地答复：“明天再说”，结果小孩出血过多，第二天未及动手术就死了。定县宋俊拴是一个二十五岁的青年小伙子，因患疝症入院。经王丕昌诊断是裂孔疝（重于一般疝症）。动手术时王竟让没有经验的牙科医生袁文海和护士李顺才试作。结果手术不当，不到三天，病人死去。死后为了掩饰罪行，王丕昌虚报是因所谓急性胃扩张而死，用以蒙蔽群众，欺骗领导。高邑县西驿村妇女姜大利因病入院，起初由刘正动手术，他故意切破病人膀胱和右侧输尿管，王丕昌接着又故意切断左侧输尿管，致使病人不尿而死。王丕昌等对于革命军人更为仇视。中国人民解放军战士刘春长、高林城、马春华和志愿军战士刘凤和四人因病到医院休养，河北省卫生厅指示给注射连霉素和盘尼西林治疗，王丕昌、刘正竟给他们注射了半年多的蒸馏水，因此这四个战士的病久治不愈。
    这个反革命集团还经常散布谣言，破坏各个时期的中心工作。当朝鲜战争爆发时，刘正造谣说：“第三次世界大战不久要爆发。”后来又散布解放台湾会引起世界大战的谣言，并大肆破坏和平签名运动和发行新币等工作。反革命分子李宗泉公开说：“日本再来统治几年才好”。反革命分子猖狂地对院内共产党员说：“你们是共产党，我是国民党，你说怎办就怎办吧。”由于这个反革命集团明目张胆地任意进行罪恶活动，不少职工群众称这个医院为“反动派的下处”，称外科是“杀人科”。这个反革命集团的罪恶活动，早已引起医院职工的愤怒。共产党员张志坤、史信等和群众，纷纷向中共石家庄地委和公安机关检举和揭发这个反革命集团的罪行。经过公安机关的侦察，证据确凿，这个反革命集团终于被破获。这些反革命分子将受到法律的严厉惩办。
