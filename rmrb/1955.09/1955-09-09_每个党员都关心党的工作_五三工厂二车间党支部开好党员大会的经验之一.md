    Every Party Member Cares About Party Work
    ——One of the Experiences of the No. 2 Workshop Party Branch of Factory 53 in Holding a Good General Membership Meeting
    Chen Xing

    When you attend the general membership meeting of the No. 2 Workshop Branch of Factory 53, you will find the atmosphere at the meeting is tense and heated. The speeches of party members and the masses are enthusiastic and incisive. Some people raised their hands six times and still did not get a chance to speak, so they raised their hands for the seventh time. Party members and the masses fearlessly raised various criticisms and suggestions to the leading comrades of the branch, workshop, and work section.

    In order to get every party member to care about the work of the Party, the No. 2 Workshop Branch has done relatively meticulous mass work.

    To enable party members and the masses to have heated discussions on the agenda at the general membership meeting, the first thing to do is to make party members aware of their obligations and rights. Therefore, the branch led party members in studying the Constitution of the Communist Party of China twice in November 1953 and March 1954, and mobilized everyone to speak at the meeting. However, in October of last year, the Party branch found that there were still many party members who did not speak at the general membership meeting. This shows that some party members still do not care enough about the work of the Party. Why don't they care about the work of the Party? The Party branch then began to look for ideological reasons.

    The branch arranged a forum and selected some comrades who did not speak at the general membership meeting to talk about their opinions on the general membership meeting. At this forum, the branch secretary raised the question: "Why do some of our comrades always fail to speak at the general membership meeting?" At this time, Wang Dianjun, the foreman of the inspection work section, said: "What is there to say? Can the workshop director and the branch secretary have any mistakes in considering problems? Even if there are still some loopholes, we are no better than them." Wang Dianjun's words represented the opinions of some comrades; other comrades were obviously worried about speaking, and they simply answered: "We have many shortcomings ourselves, so how can we give opinions to others?"

    The branch studied the speeches at the forum and found that there were these two ideological situations among those who did not speak: one was that some comrades regarded the leading work as merely the business of the branch committee or administrative leaders, and therefore, they did not actively care about the work of the Party; the other was that some comrades had more ideological problems and had some dissatisfaction with the Party, so they did not dare or did not want to speak.

    These two situations fully illustrate that there are shortcomings in the work of the branch. The first situation shows that the branch did not inspire the collective wisdom of party members and limited the Party's leadership work to a few activists. Therefore, only these activists spoke at the general membership meeting; the second situation shows that the Party lacked due care and help for party members with ideological problems and did not promptly remove their ideological burdens and stimulate their enthusiasm. Precisely because of these two shortcomings, although the Party Constitution was studied, democracy had not been fully promoted at the general membership meeting.

    Starting from these two situations, the branch began to do patient and meticulous work. Here are two examples.

    Wang Dianjun's thinking belongs to the first situation. The branch secretary had a cordial conversation with Wang Dianjun and gave him a task, asking him to start studying the reasons for the uneven production in the workshop in the past two months and the solutions, so that he could bring it up at the next general membership meeting to discuss the issue of balanced production. Wang Dianjun happily accepted this task. He felt that this was a manifestation of the Party's attention and trust in him, so he worked especially hard to carry out this work. He used various opportunities to learn about the situation in various work sections and functional groups. The branch secretary also specifically helped him collect data, analyze problems, calculate figures, etc. In this way, Wang Dianjun spoke at the general membership meeting, and this first speech was very brilliant. He specifically analyzed the various specific reasons for the uneven production in the workshop, and finally clearly concluded: "The workshop leaders do not go deep into reality and have a bureaucratic work style, and they do not solve problems in a timely manner, which is the biggest obstacle to balanced production." All party members believed that his conclusion was correct, and his opinion was incorporated into the resolution of this general membership meeting. Obviously, this matter was a profound education for Wang Dianjun, making him realize that any party member who cares about the work of the Party can participate in the Party's collective leadership and exert the Party's collective strength. Since then, he has often spoken at the general membership meeting and has become a Party activist.

    Liu Yushu did not speak at the general membership meeting for a long time, which belonged to the second situation. Before joining the Party, his work was active, but after joining the Party, he became uneasy about work. He believed that the Party did not pay enough attention to and care for him, so he was dissatisfied with the Party. The branch studied his problem and instructed the branch organization committee member to help him. First, they criticized his dissatisfaction, and then worked with him to find the key to production, and mobilized him to report the results of the research at the general membership meeting. In addition, he was absorbed as the publication organizer of the workshop's Party newspaper, and he was also asked to participate more in mass work. Liu Yushu gradually realized that the Party cared about him. At a forum criticizing the influence of bourgeois ideology, he finally told the Party what was in his heart. He said: "I always thought that the Party organization did not care about me. Actually, it was my own thinking that had problems. Now I realize my mistakes. In the past, I did not use the standards of a party member to demand myself, so I adopted an attitude of indifference to the work of the Party. In the future, I will definitely resolutely correct my mistakes and strive to be a true party member." Since then, he has also become a Party activist, caring about the work of the Party, and often making sharp comments to the leaders at the general membership meeting.

    These two educational works gave the branch an experience: that is, the Party organization should often care for every party member, so that every party member can actively care for the work of the Party. In order to further do this work well, at the end of February this year, the branch conducted another survey and found that party members who did not speak at the general membership meeting still accounted for 32 percent of all party members. Some of these comrades had the same ideological situation as Wang Dianjun and Liu Yushu, and the branch took the above methods to help them. However, some other comrades did not want to speak, but simply did not have the habit of speaking or did not know where to start. For example, some comrades said: "Others have a lot to say, but I can't say a word." Some comrades said: "I was preparing to speak, but I forgot everything when I stood up." For these comrades, the branch also started to encourage them to speak. For example, after the agenda of each general membership meeting was announced, the branch committee members went down to help these party members to discover and analyze problems around the agenda, and told them which aspects they could raise questions from, so that they were prepared in their hearts. At the meeting, the executive chairman also paid special attention to giving priority to those comrades who spoke less, and they had the opportunity to stand up and speak when they raised their hands. After several exercises, these comrades who used to have a pounding heart when they stood up can now speak calmly.

    To strive for party members to care about the work of the Party, in addition to encouraging them to speak, it is also necessary to actively mobilize party members to do the work of the Party by using various opportunities. The No. 2 Workshop Branch believes that attracting party members to participate in the work of the resolution drafting committee and the inspection team of the general membership meeting is an effective way to improve party members' sense of responsibility for the work of the Party. Therefore, the No. 2 Workshop Branch does not treat these two tasks in a formalistic manner, but pays attention to how to give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of party members in doing the work of the Party through these two tasks. The branch committee assigned specific tasks to each comrade participating in the resolution drafting committee, asking them to go deep into the lower levels to collect information according to the requirements of the agenda, so as to concentrate everyone's wisdom to formulate a practical draft resolution. The enlarged meeting of the branch committee (with the participation of party members and the masses) solemnly discussed this draft, and then submitted it to the meeting for discussion. The branch committee also cared about the comrades participating in the inspection team, providing them with convenience for their work, and making them a powerful assistant for the branch committee to carry out its work. Many party members regarded participating in these two tasks as a glorious task assigned to them by all party members, so they could conscientiously and responsibly complete them. Through these two tasks, they realized that doing the work of the Party is not the business of a few people, and every party member has a responsibility, thus improving their enthusiasm for doing the work of the Party.

    In addition, the No. 2 Workshop Branch attaches great importance to and handles any criticisms and suggestions raised by party members and the masses at the general membership meeting, especially criticisms of the Party and administrative leaders. They believe that ensuring that party members' opinions are answered in a timely manner, earnestly accepting the correct opinions of the masses and implementing them will greatly help party members establish a sense of ownership of the work of the Party. When the implementation of the economic accounting system began, the propaganda work of the No. 2 Workshop lagged behind the movement. Comrade Ding Fuwen, who was engaged in propaganda work in the workshop, criticized the Party branch at the general membership meeting. He said: "When this economic accounting started, the propaganda work did not keep up. This is because the propagandists themselves do not understand the economic accounting system and do not have the capital to publicize. The Party branch only made general appeals and did not give the propagandists various help, which is wrong." The branch accepted his criticism and immediately organized the propagandists to study the economic accounting system after the meeting.

    These efforts of the No. 2 Workshop Branch not only expanded the ranks of Party activists, but also made the general membership meeting truly play the role of the highest leading organ of the Party's grassroots organization. At the same time, the level of the No. 2 Workshop Party Branch's daily leadership work has also been improved.

    每个党员都关心党的工作
    ——五三工厂二车间党支部开好党员大会的经验之一
    陈星
    当你参加五三工厂二车间支部的党员大会时，你会发现会场的空气是紧张的、热烈的。党员群众的发言是踊跃的、尖锐的。有的人举了六次手还得不到发言的机会，又举第七次手。党员群众对支部、车间和工段的领导同志毫无顾虑地提出了各种批评和建议。
    为了使每个党员都来关心党的工作，二车间支部曾做了比较细致的群众工作。
    要使党员群众在党员大会上对议题展开热烈的讨论，首先要让党员认识党员的义务和权利，因此，支部曾在一九五三年十一月和一九五四年三月两次领导党员学习了中国共产党党章，发动大家在大会上发言。但到去年十月，党支部发现仍然有不少党员在党员大会上不发言。这说明了一部分党员对党的工作还不够关心。为什么他们对党的工作不关心呢？党支部就着手来找思想原因。
    支部布置了一个座谈会，选择了一些在党员大会上不发言的同志谈谈对党员大会的意见。在这个座谈会上支部书记把问题提出来了：“为什么我们有些同志总不在党员大会上发言呢？”这时候，检验工段工长王殿君说：“有什么可说的呢？车间主任和支部书记考虑问题还有什么错误吗？即使还有些漏洞，我们也不比他们强。”王殿君的话代表着一部分同志的意见；另一部分同志显然对发言有些思想顾虑，他们只是这样回答：“我们自己缺点不少，怎么还给别人提意见呢？”
    支部研究了座谈会的发言，发现了不发言的人有这两种思想情况：一种是有些同志把领导工作当作仅仅是支委会或行政领导的事，因此，他们就不主动地来关心党的工作；另一种是有些同志思想问题较多，对党有些不满情绪，因此就不敢或不想发言。
    这两种情况充分说明支部的工作有缺点。第一种情况说明支部没有启发党员的集体智慧，把党的领导工作局限在少数积极分子手中，因此，在党员大会上发言的也只限于这些积极分子；另一种情况说明党对有思想问题的党员缺少应有的关怀和帮助，没有及时解除他们的思想包袱，启发他们的积极性。正因为有这两个缺点，所以虽然学习了党章，但在党员大会上还没有充分发扬民主。
    针对这两种情况出发，支部就动手来做耐心的细致的工作。这里可以举两个例子。
    王殿君的思想属于第一种情况。支部书记便找王殿君亲切地谈了一次话，交给他一个任务，要他着手去研究车间这两个月生产不均衡的原因和解决办法，以便在下次党员大会讨论均衡生产问题时提出来。王殿君愉快地接受了这个任务，他感到这是党对他的重视和信任的表现，因此特别努力去进行这项工作。他利用各种机会到各工段、各职能组去了解情况。支部书记又具体地帮助他搜集资料、分析问题、计算数字等。这样，王殿君就在党员大会上发言了，这第一次发言就很精彩。他具体分析了车间生产不均衡的各种具体原因，最后又明确地做出如下结论：“车间领导不深入实际，有官僚主义作风，解决问题不及时，是均衡生产最大的障碍。”全体党员都认为他的结论是正确的，他的意见就被吸收到这次党员大会的决议中去了。显然，这件事对王殿君是一次深刻的教育，使他意识到任何一个党员只要关心党的工作就能参加党的集体领导，发挥出党的集体力量。从此他就经常在党员大会上发言，成为党的积极分子了。
    刘玉书长期不在党员大会上发言属于第二种情况。入党之前，他的工作是积极的，入党之后却反而不安心工作起来，他认为党对他重视和关心不够，因而对党有不满情绪。支部研究了他的问题，就责成支部组织委员去帮助他。首先批评了他的不满情绪，然后同他一起找生产中的关键，动员他把研究的结果在党员大会上报告。此外，吸收他做车间党报的出刊组织员，又要他多参加群众工作。刘玉书逐渐认识到党是对他关怀的。在一次批判资产阶级思想影响的座谈会上，他终于向党说出了心里话，他说：“我一直以为党组织对我是不关心的，好多事都‘蒙’着我，实际上是我自己思想有问题。现在我认识到自己的错误了。过去，我没有用党员的标准来要求自己，所以对党的工作采取漠不关心的态度。今后我一定坚决改正错误，努力做一个真正的党员。”此后，他也成为党的积极分子，关心党的工作，时常在党员大会上对领导提出尖锐的意见。
    这两次教育工作使支部得到了一个经验：就是党组织应该经常关怀每个党员，就能使每个党员积极地关怀党的工作。为了进一步做好这一工作，今年二月底，支部又进行了一次调查，发现全车间没有在党员大会上发言的党员还占全体党员的百分之三十二。其中一部分同志不发言有着王殿君和刘玉书同样的思想情况，支部就采取了上述办法来帮助他们。但另有一部分同志并非是不想发言，而只是没有发言的习惯或者不知从那里说起好。如有的同志说：“别人一大套，我有话一句也说不上来。”有的同志说：“我准备要发言，但一站起来全忘了。”对这部分同志，支部也动手来启发他们发言。如每次党员大会议题公布出来后，支部委员即下去帮助这些党员围绕着议题来发现问题分析问题，告诉他们可以从那几方面提出问题，使他们心中有了准备。在大会中，执行主席也特别注意让那些发言少的同志优先发言，他们一举手，就有机会站起来发言。经过几次锻炼，这些过去一站起来就心跳的同志现在也能从容地发言了。
    要争取党员来关心党的工作，除了启发他们发言外，还必须利用各种机会积极动员党员来做党的工作。二车间支部认为，吸引党员参加党员大会的决议起草委员会和检查组的工作是提高党员对党的工作的责任感的有效方法。因此，二车间支部并不是以形式主义的态度对待这两件工作，而是注意到如何通过这两件工作来发挥党员做党的工作的主动性和积极性。支委会给每个参加决议起草委员会的同志分配了具体任务，要他们根据议题的要求深入下层收集情况，从而集中大家的智慧订出切合实际的决议草案，支委扩大会议（有党员群众参加）郑重地讨论这个草案，然后再提交大会讨论。支委会也很关心参加检查组工作的同志，给他们工作的方便，使他们成为支委会进行工作的有力助手。许多党员都把参加这两项工作当作全体党员交给他们的光荣任务，因此都能切实负责地去完成。通过这两项工作，使他们认识到做好党的工作不是少数人的事，每个党员都有责任，因而也就提高了他们做党的工作的热情。
    此外，二车间支部十分重视和处理党员群众在党员大会上提出的任何批评和建议，特别是对党和行政领导的批评意见。他们认为，保证党员的意见及时得到答复，切实地接受群众正确的意见并付之实施，就会大大帮助党员对党的工作树立主人翁的态度。贯彻经济核算制开始时，二车间的宣传工作落在运动后面，搞车间宣传工作的丁富文同志就在党员大会上对党支部提出批评，他说：“这次经济核算开始时，宣传工作没有跟上，这是因为宣传员自己不懂经济核算制，没有本钱宣传，党支部只作一般的号召，没有给宣传员各种帮助，这是不对的。”支部接受了他的批评，会后就立即组织宣传员来学习经济核算制。
    二车间支部的这些努力，不但扩大了党的积极分子的队伍，并使党员大会真正发挥了党的基层组织最高领导机关的作用。同时，二车间党支部的日常领导工作的水平也就随着提高了。
