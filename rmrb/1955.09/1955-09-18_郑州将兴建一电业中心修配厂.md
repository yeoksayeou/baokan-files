    Zhengzhou to Build an Electrical Industry Central Repair and Assembly Plant
    A state-owned electrical industry central repair and assembly plant will begin construction in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, at the intersection of the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways. The factory site has been selected, and the construction preparations are largely completed. Construction will begin soon.
    This factory is quite large in scale and has relatively complete equipment. It will be able to manufacture a variety of products, such as steel frames and purlins for factory buildings, as well as air ducts for boiler equipment, needed in power plant infrastructure construction projects. This factory will also have a large-capacity oxygen plant. Once completed, this factory will be able to manufacture a large amount of materials and oxygen needed for construction projects in new and expanded power plants in Wuhan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, and other places south of the Yellow River, in order to accelerate the construction of electrical projects in these areas.

    郑州将兴建一电业中心修配厂
    一座国营的电业中心修配厂将在京汉、陇海铁路的交岔点——河南省郑州市着手兴建。这个厂的厂址已经选定，施工准备工作已经大体做好，不久即可开工。
    这个工厂规模相当大，设备也比较完善，将能制造多种产品，如发电厂基本建设工程中需用的厂房钢架、桁条以及锅炉设备中的风管道等。这个工厂还将设有生产能力很大的氧气场。这个工厂建成以后，就能给黄河以南武汉、西安、郑州、徐州等地新建和扩建的发电厂，制造建筑工程中需要的大量材料和氧气等，以加速这些地区电业工程的建设。（本报驻郑州记者）
