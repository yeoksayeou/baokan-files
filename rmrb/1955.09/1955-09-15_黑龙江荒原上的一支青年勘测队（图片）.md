    Heilongjiang Province in our country has vast and fertile grasslands. According to preliminary estimates based on existing materials, there are still nearly a thousand hectares of uncultivated wasteland here, far exceeding the existing cultivated land area of the entire Heilongjiang Province. The natural conditions of these wastelands are very good and suitable for agricultural production. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, Heilongjiang Province plans to survey three million hectares of land suitable for cultivation on these wastelands.
    Starting in mid-July of this year, a survey army of more than 1,000 people began a large-scale survey and investigation work on the vast wasteland, actively providing planning materials for the reclamation of three million hectares of wasteland. The wasteland that needs to be surveyed and investigated on the ground this time is more than six million hectares, which is almost equivalent to the entire cultivated land area of Heilongjiang Province.
    This huge survey team is working selflessly with the strong help of Soviet experts. By the end of this year, they will complete the comprehensive survey of 800,000 hectares of wasteland.

    我国黑龙江省有着辽阔富饶的大草原，根据现有材料的初步估计，这里还有近千垧未开垦的荒地，远远超过黑龙江全省现有的耕地面积，这些荒地的自然条件都很好，适合于农业生产。在第一个五年计划时期内，黑龙江省计划要在这些荒地上勘测出三百万垧可以耕种的土地。
    从今年七月中旬起，一支一千多人组成的勘测大军，就在广阔的荒地上开始了规模巨大的勘测调查工作，积极为给开垦三百万垧荒地提供规划材料。这次需要实地踏勘调查的荒地在六百万垧以上，几乎相等于现在黑龙江省的全部耕地面积。
    这支巨大的勘测队伍正在苏联专家的大力帮助下忘我地劳动着，到今年年底，他们将完成八十万垧荒地的综合调查工作。
