    Exposing Three "Decisions" That Waste Timber
    Wang Zhonglan
    Timber is an indispensable and important material in national economic construction. China's timber resources are not very abundant, so we must pay close attention to saving and using timber rationally. However, the departments that currently control timber production and distribution have made several decisions that waste timber.
    The first is: In the first half of this year, units under the State Bureau of Materials Reserves transferred 17,620 cubic meters of pine logs (mostly Korean pine) from the Northeast Timber Industry Administration, and used 70 percent of it as dunnage to store materials in warehouses. Korean pine is one of the most valuable types of timber with the greatest utilization value. It should be used to build buildings, factories, bridges, and manufacture ships and vehicles. Using it as support legs in warehouses is a huge waste.
    In the past, the timber supply departments provided the State Bureau of Materials Reserves with substandard railroad ties with excessively large cracks from processing as dunnage. These railroad ties were perfectly usable as legs for warehouses. The price of these railroad ties is only one-third or one-quarter of the price of large squared timber. The problem is so obvious, why does the State Bureau of Materials Reserves insist on abandoning reasonable practices? And why do the departments in charge of timber allow them to do so?
    The second is: The state-owned timber processing departments in Northeast China produce a certain amount of veneer each year to meet the packaging needs of certain factories. These boards mainly utilize the slabs left over from processing timber. Generally, more than 90 percent of the timber used for construction or production is high-quality Korean and white pine. The slabs or smaller-sized timber left over after processing are naturally mostly Korean and white pine as well. The amount of this discarded small-sized timber in the Northeast region alone amounts to between 200,000 and 700,000 cubic meters each year. Except for a portion sold to rural areas through commercial departments, the rest can only be treated as packaging materials.
    In 1955, timber processing departments in Northeast China had a large backlog of veneer that could not be properly handled; however, the departments in charge of timber blindly instructed timber processing departments to process poplar veneer instead. The reason is that pine wood is more expensive and the price of the board is also high, and the using departments are generally unwilling to purchase it in order to reduce costs. Of course, reducing the cost of using materials and saving pine wood is a good thing; however, before the problem of the outlet for pine veneer has been resolved, abandoning the use of pine veneer and allowing it to accumulate in large quantities, and processing poplar veneer instead, what benefits will this bring other than causing greater waste to the state?
    The third is: In the past, the special materials used by the transportation departments to manufacture vehicles were all processed by the vehicle manufacturing departments themselves. Starting in 1955, in order to give timber processing departments a certain amount of production tasks, the departments in charge of timber completely handed over the materials for manufacturing vehicles to the timber processing departments for processing and unified supply. The result of this is: the timber processing departments do not understand the structure and performance of vehicles, and are limited by equipment and technology, so some timber cannot be processed at all. The vehicle manufacturing departments themselves have affiliated processing workshops with large production capacity, and after the timber processing work is handed over to the forestry departments, these workshops have to be closed down. For this reason, the timber processing departments decided to supply the vehicle manufacturing departments with semi-finished products – extra-large squared timber (i.e., logs with the bark sawn off on all four sides). However, the problem has not been solved, because the vehicle departments still have to process these semi-finished products separately after they receive them. As a result, the timber is sawn smaller and shorter. If the vehicle manufacturing departments had used the logs to process themselves from the beginning, the minimum timber that could be utilized would be about 70 to 75 percent. And after the timber department first carries out an unnecessary semi-finished product processing, and the vehicle manufacturing department then carries out a second processing, according to the highest estimate, the timber that is actually used on the vehicle can only be about 60 to 65 percent. This invisibly causes 10 to 15 percent of the timber to be wasted for nothing.
    The main responsibility for the above-mentioned matters does not lie with the using departments, but with the state departments in charge of timber. If these man-made wastes are from the hands of bureaucrats, I think these bureaucrats should wake up now. If it is because of "unfamiliarity with the business" or "lack of understanding of the situation", then when serious waste has been placed before them, it is also time to take action to improve.

### 揭发三件浪费木材的“决定”

    揭发三件浪费木材的“决定”
    王中岚
    木材是国家经济建设中不可缺少的重要物资，我国的木材资源又不很丰富，因此必须十分注意节省和合理地使用木材。但是，现在国家掌握木材生产和分配的部门，却做出了几项浪费木材的决定。
    第一件是：今年上半年，国家物资储备局所属各单位由东北制材工业管理局调入了松木大方材一万七千六百二十立方公尺（其中大部是红松），把百分之七十用来做了仓库储放物资的垫木。红松是木材当中最珍贵、利用价值也最大的树种之一，应该用来建筑楼房、工厂、桥梁、制造轮船、车辆，若用作仓库里的支垫楞腿，这是一宗很大的浪费。
    过去，木材供应部门给国家物资储备局供应的垫木全部是加工时裂缝过大的不合格的枕木。这些枕木用作仓库的楞腿是完全可以的。这种枕木的价格只及大方材的三分之一或四分之一。问题这样明显，为什么国家物资储备局偏偏要舍弃合理的做法呢？掌握木材的部门为什么又允许他们这样做呢？
    第二件是：东北地区的国营木材加工部门每年都要生产一定数量的薄木板来供应某些工厂包装产品的需要。这些板材主要是利用加工成材时剩下来的板皮。一般建筑或生产所用的木材，有百分之九十以上都是上等的红白松，加工以后所剩下来的板皮或尺码较小的木材当然也是红白松较多了。这种被舍弃的小尺码的木材，单单东北地区每年就有二三十万到六七十万立方公尺。其中除一部分通过商业部门销售给农村以外，其余的就只好当作包装用材处理了。
    一九五五年，东北地区的木材加工部门积压大量的薄板材不能得到适当的处理；但是，掌握木材的部门还盲目地责成木材加工部门另行加工杨木薄板材。原因是松木较贵，板材的价格也高，使用部门为了降低成本，多不愿购用。当然，降低用材部门的成本和节约松木，这是好事情；但是，在松木薄板材的出路问题还没有解决以前，就舍弃松木板材不用，任其大量积压，而去另行加工杨木板材，这除了会给国家造成更大的浪费外，还有什么好处呢？
    第三件是：过去交通运输部门制造车辆的特殊用材，都是车辆制造部门自己加工的。从一九五五年开始，掌握木材的部门为了给木材加工部门凑足一定的生产任务，便把制造车辆的用材完全交由木材加工部门加工和统一供应。这样做的结果是：木材加工部门不了解车辆的构造性能，又为设备和技术所限，有些木材根本没办法加工。而车辆制造部门本身拥有生产能力很大的附属加工车间，把木材加工工作交给林业部门之后，这些车间就得停闭。为此，木材加工部门又决定以半成品——特大方材（即把四边的树皮锯掉以后的原木），供应给车辆制造部门。可是问题仍没有解决，因为车辆部门在拿到这些半成品之后，还得另行加工。因而木材越锯越小，越截越短。如果车辆制造部门一开始就利用原木自行加工，能够利用的木材最少也有百分之七十到七十五左右。而经过木材部门先来一次毫无必要的半成品的加工，车辆制造部门接着来一次再加工，按最高估计，木材真正被利用于车辆上的，也只能是百分之六十至六十五左右。这就无形中使百分之十至十五的木材被白白地丢掉了。
    上面所举的这几件事情，主要的责任不在于用材部门，而在于国家掌握木材的部门。如果说这些人为的浪费是出自官僚主义者之手，我认为现在这些官僚主义者应该醒醒了。如果说是因为“业务不熟”或者“不了解情况”，那末，在严重的浪费已经摆在他们面前的时候，也到了动手改进的时候了。
