France's Strike Movement Surges

France's strike movement is surging. The strike movement has now spread to many industrial enterprises in Nantes, Dunkirk, Le Havre, Brest, La Traitresse (Seine-Maritime), and other cities.

In La Traitresse, the "Republican Security Force" occupied the striking shipyard factory buildings. In Nantes, negotiations between workers and employers broke down after the shipyard and other factory owners refused to consider the workers' demand for a 40 percent wage increase. Workers from almost all industrial enterprises in Nantes therefore held another strike on the 24th.

The strike by bus drivers and ticket collectors in Paris, which began on the afternoon of August 30, has been victorious after persisting for thirty-six hours. The Paris Municipal Transportation Authority has agreed to fulfill its promise to add wages for drivers and ticket collectors from January 1st of this year.

A characteristic of this strike movement by the French working people is the increasingly frequent concerted action taken by lower-level trade union organizations affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), "Workers' Force," and other trade union federations.

Six Million Workers in West Germany Demand Wage Increases

Six million organized workers in West Germany are launching a movement demanding wage increases and reduced working hours. Steelworkers and coal miners affiliated with the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) have already made such demands.

Recently, strike incidents in West Germany have become increasingly frequent. According to the German News Agency, since the beginning of June, there have been approximately forty strikes among workers in West Germany, primarily among metalworkers; in the first two weeks of August alone, there were as many as fifteen strikes. On the 23rd, another 7,500 metalworkers in Hamburg and Kassel went on strike to fight for wage increases.

According to the German News Agency, West German Chancellor Adenauer, in view of the growing scale of the West German workers' movement demanding wage increases, has personally intervened in wage disputes. Adenauer recently met with personnel from several West German trade unions at his vacation home in Mühlendorf, attempting to curb the struggle of West German workers.

American Workers Strike Demanding Wage Increases

Recently, many workers in the United States have held strikes.

Fourty thousand members of the United Automobile Workers union at eighteen factories of "International Harvester Company" continue to strike. According to a "Daily Worker" reporter, the workers rejected the company's proposal to meet some of the workers' demands.

Twenty thousand members of the United Automobile Workers union at five enterprises of "Studebaker-Packard Corporation" announced a strike on August 28. The strike was announced after the capital side refused to meet the demands put forward by the union when signing a new collective contract.

The strike by 1,500 sugar industry workers in Louisiana belonging to the Meat Packing Workers Union, which began on April 14, is still ongoing, despite the company's expulsion of a large number of striking workers from the factory, arrests of workers, and various strikebreaking conspiracies involving the summons of the union chairman.

The strike of employees at twenty-two large hotels in Miami Beach, Florida, which began in April, and the strike of more than 2,000 workers at "International Minerals & Chemical Corporation" in Mulberry are also continuing.

According to United Press International, 139,000 American auto workers went on strike briefly on the night of August 31. Under the strong pressure of the workers' strike, the company was finally forced to compromise and agreed to sign a new contract with the workers, stipulating wage increases.

Britain Had the Most Strikes in the First Half of This Year

According to materials published in the British Labour Department's organ, the "Ministry of Labour Gazette," in the first six months of this year, there were 1,205 strikes in Britain, involving 436,000 workers; in the first six months of 1954, there were 1,060 strikes, involving 205,100 people. The Gazette pointed out that the number of strikes in the first half of 1955 reached the highest record in the past decade since the war.

Japanese Steel Workers Hold Strike

Workers at Japan's Fuji Iron & Steel and Nippon Kokan, two major steel companies, held a 24-hour strike on the morning of the 6th, demanding higher wages.

Workers at another steel company, Sumitomo Metal Industries, took action by refusing to work overtime for three days.

These actions by steelworkers mark the beginning of a struggle launched by the Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions for workers at the five major steel companies to demand an average increase of 2,500 yen per month in wages. Workers at the other two steel companies, Yawata Iron & Steel and Kobe Steel Works, will also take action to join the struggle.

Uruguayan Workers Hold General Strike

Uruguay's 125,000 workers began a 24-hour general strike at midnight on the 5th in support of workers at the Fray Bentos meatpacking company, who have been on strike for two months demanding wage increases and the reinstatement of laid-off workers.

The striking industries include urban and rural transportation, slaughtering, textiles, flour, lumber, wool, construction, newspaper printing, and theater and film industries. (Xinhua News Agency)

    资本主义国家的罢工运动
    法国罢工运动高涨
    法国罢工运动高涨。现在，罢工运动已经波及南特、敦刻尔克、哈佛尔、布勒斯特、拉特勒（下塞纳省）和其他城市的许多工业企业。
    在拉森，“共和国保安队”占领了罢工的造船厂厂房。在南特，由于造船厂及其他工厂的厂主拒绝研究工人们关于增加工资百分之四十的要求，工人们同这些雇主的谈判宣告中断。南特几乎所有工业企业的工人因此在二十四日又举行了罢工。
    从八月三十日下午开始的巴黎公共汽车司机和售票员的罢工，在坚持了三十六小时之后已经取得胜利。巴黎市交通管理当局已经同意履行从今年一月一日起追加司机和售票员工资的诺言。
    法国劳动人民这次罢工运动的特点是：加入法国总工会、“工人力量”和其他工会联合会的下层工会组织愈来愈频繁地采取一致行动。
    西德六百万工人要求增加工资
    西德六百万有组织的工人正在展开要求增加工资和减少工作时间的运动。隶属于西德工会联合会的钢铁工人和煤矿工人都已经提出了这种要求。
    最近，西德的罢工事件日益频繁。据德意志通讯社报道，从六月初以来，在西德工人，主要是在五金工人当中，发生了约四十次罢工；单是在八月的头两周中，罢工就达十五次之多。二十三日，在汉堡和卡塞尔又有七千五百名五金工人为争取增加工资举行了罢工。
    据德意志通讯社消息，西德总理阿登纳鉴于西德工人要求增加工资运动的规模日益扩大，已经亲自干预工资纠纷问题。阿登纳最近在他休假的地方穆伦接见了好几个西德工会的人员，企图遏阻西德工人的斗争。
    美国工人罢工要求增加工资
    美国最近有许多工人举行了罢工。
    “国际收割机公司”的十八家工厂的四万名联合汽车工人工会会员继续进行罢工。据“工人日报”记者报道，工人们拒绝了公司提出的满足工人部分要求的建议。
    “沈迪克斯飞机公司”的五家企业的两万名联合汽车工人工会会员在八月二十八日宣布罢工，这次罢工是在资方在签订新的集体合同时，拒绝满足工会提出的要求后宣布的。
    路易斯安那州的属于肉类包装工人工会的一千五百名食糖工业工人从四月十四日开始的罢工还在继续进行中，侭管有大批罢工工人被公司逐出厂房、对工人进行逮捕以及传讯工会主席的种种破坏罢工的阴谋。
    在四月间开始的佛罗里达州马伊亚米—比奇的二十二个大旅馆的职工的罢工以及马尔贝里的“国际采矿和化学公司”的两千多工人的罢工也都在继续中。
    据合众社报道，美国十三万九千汽车工人在八月三十一日夜曾一度罢工。在工人们罢工的强大压力下，公司方面终于被迫让步，表示同意同工人签订新的合同，规定提高工资。
    今年上半年英国罢工次数最多
    根据英国劳工部机关报“劳工部公报”发表的材料，在今年头六个月中，英国发生了一千二百零五次罢工，参加罢工的有四十三万六千名工人；在一九五四年头六个月中发生的罢工次数是一千零六十次，参加罢工的人数是二十万五千一百人。公报指出，一九五五年上半年的罢工次数达到战后十年来的最高纪录。
    日本钢铁工人举行罢工
    日本富士制铁和日本钢管两大钢铁公司的工人，在六日早晨举行二十四小时罢工，要求提高工资。
    另一个钢铁公司——住友金属工业公司的工人采取了在三天内拒绝加班的斗争。
    钢铁工人的这些行动，是日本钢铁产业工会联合会发动的五大钢铁公司的工人要求平均提高每月工资二千五百日元的斗争的开端。另外两个钢铁公司——八幡制铁公司和神户制钢所的工人也将采取行动，参加斗争。
    乌拉圭工人举行总罢工
    乌拉圭十二万五千名工人五日午夜开始举行二十四小时总罢工，声援为要求增加工资和恢复被解雇工人的工作而罢工了两个月的费罗斯马尔特肉品公司的工人。
    罢工的行业包括有城市和乡村交通运输业、屠宰业、纺织业、面粉业、木材业、羊毛业、建筑业、报纸印刷业、戏剧电影业等。（据新华社讯）
