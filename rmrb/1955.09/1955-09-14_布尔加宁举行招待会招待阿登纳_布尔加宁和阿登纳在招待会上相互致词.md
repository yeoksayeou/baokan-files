Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 12th (TASS): Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin held a reception at the Kremlin on the evening of September 12th to host Federal Republic of Germany Chancellor Adenauer.

Present at the reception were Chancellor Adenauer, members of the Federal Republic of Germany government delegation, and personnel accompanying the delegation.

On the Soviet side were Kaganovich, Malenkov, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov, Suslov, Khrushchev, ministers of various Soviet ministries, and figures from all walks of life in the Soviet Union.

Bulganin and Adenauer exchanged toasts at the reception.

Bulganin pointed out that the negotiations between the Soviet government delegation and the Federal Republic of Germany government delegation were coming to an end. He said: We are not prepared to predict the final outcome of the negotiations at this time. Events will follow their own course. But I want to say that everything will end satisfactorily. As the saying goes, patience is a virtue. (Applause)

Bulganin continued, whatever happens, we have dealt with each other well and exchanged views frankly. Everything will turn out for the better. I am not a pessimist. I take an optimistic view of things. Therefore, I believe that everything will go smoothly.

Khrushchev said: If both sides have such a desire.

Bulganin continued: "I believe that a satisfactory solution to the issues we have discussed frankly and sincerely will be of great significance for resolving all issues in our bilateral relations, and there are quite a few of these issues.

Gentlemen, I want you to know that the Soviet government is not gambling, but is pursuing a sincere policy of peaceful diplomacy aimed at consolidating world peace." (Stormy applause)

Bulganin concluded: "A toast to the establishment of normal diplomatic and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and to the executors of this policy—the leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany and the leaders of the Soviet Union!" (Stormy applause)

Adenauer responded: "Gentlemen, in recent days, we have had very sincere, frank, and sometimes even intense conversations with the leaders of the Soviet government. My neighbor on the right, Mr. Khrushchev, expressed his thoughts very frankly. This is a man who can be trusted."

Adenauer pointed out that Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin had organized the visit of the Federal Republic of Germany government delegation to Moscow very well.

He said: "When we return home, we will be convinced that the visit to Moscow was a beneficial event and left us with many pleasant impressions. You have read much about the reactions to our negotiations in the newspapers. The newspapers are sometimes correct, but not always. I want to say that we have conducted important and decisive negotiations here in front of you.

A toast to good and friendly relations between us, not just diplomatic relations (diplomats are not always good friends), but also to diplomatic relations, and to the health of the Soviet people and the German people!" (Applause)

    布尔加宁和阿登纳在招待会上相互致词
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁九月十二日晚间在克里姆林宫举行招待会，招待德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳。
    出席招待会的有阿登纳总理，德意志联邦共和国政府代表团团员以及陪同代表团的人士。

    布尔加宁和阿登纳在招待会上相互致词。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联政府代表团同德意志联邦共和国政府代表团的谈判即将结束。他说：我们现在不准备预测谈判的最后结果。事件会照它自己的规律进行。但是我要说，一切都会完满结束的。俗话说得好，忍耐为上着。（掌声）
    布尔加宁接着说，无论怎样说，我们很好地打了交道，坦率地交换了意见。一切都将转好的。我不是悲观主义者。我是抱着乐观的态度来看事物的。因此我相信，一切都会顺利的。
    赫鲁晓夫说：如果双方都有这样的愿望的话。
    布尔加宁继续说：“我认为，圆满解决我们坦率真诚地讨论的那些问题，对于解决我们两国关系的一切问题有巨大的意义，而这些问题是不少的。
    先生们，我希望你们知道，苏联政府不是在赌博，而是在执行以巩固世界和平为目的的真诚的和平外交政策。”（暴风雨般的掌声）
    布尔加宁最后说：“为了苏联和德意志联邦共和国建立正常的外交和友好关系，为了这个政策的执行者——德意志联邦共和国的领袖们和苏联的领袖们，干杯！”（暴风雨般的掌声）
    阿登纳致答词说：“先生们，我们最近几天同苏联政府的领导者作了很真诚的、坦率的、有时甚至很激烈的交谈，我的右边的邻人，赫鲁晓夫先生，非常坦率地说出了他的想法。这个人是可以信赖的。”
    阿登纳指出，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁对德意志联邦共和国政府代表团的访问莫斯科组织得很好。
    他说：“我们回国的时候将深信，莫斯科的访问是有益的事情，给我们留下了很多愉快的印象。关于我们的谈判的反应你们在报纸上读到了许多。报纸说的有时是正确的，但是并不是一贯如此。我要说，我们在这里当着你们的面进行了重要的而且具有决定意义的谈判。
    为了我们之间的良好的友好关系，而不仅仅是外交关系（外交家并不总是好朋友），但是也为了外交关系，为了苏联人民和德国人民的健康，干杯！”（掌声）
