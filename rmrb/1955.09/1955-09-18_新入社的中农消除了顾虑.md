Column: Agricultural Production Cooperatives Generally Achieve Bumper Harvests

    The new middle peasants who joined the cooperative have eliminated their concerns.
    The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Liushi Township, Yanqi Hui Autonomous County, Xinjiang Province, achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of winter and spring wheat this year. The 138 mu of winter wheat sown by the cooperative yielded an average of 353 jin per mu, which is 50 to 80 jin higher than the yield of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers; the 611 mu of spring wheat yielded an average of 186 jin per mu, which is 45 jin higher than last year's spring wheat yield and 30 jin higher than that of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The bumper harvest of crops greatly increased the income of cooperative members. According to the cooperative's pre-distribution plan, each work day can be distributed 23.3 jin of wheat; the cooperative member household with the most distribution can get 7,223 jin of wheat, and the cooperative member household with the least distribution can also get 1,410 jin of wheat. This year's newly joined middle peasant, Jia Mali, still had some concerns after joining the cooperative, fearing that he would get less grain. His family has four laborers. Last year, he earned only 6,600 jin of wheat from individual farming throughout the year. This year, he received 7,223 jin of wheat just from the summer harvest pre-distribution. He said happily, "I have seen the benefits of agricultural cooperatives. The income from the summer harvest alone has exceeded my income from individual farming for a whole year. Where else can you find a household that harvests more grain than an agricultural cooperative?"

专栏：农业生产合作社普遍大丰收

    新入社的中农消除了顾虑
    新疆省焉耆回族自治县六十户乡红星农业合作社今年冬春小麦均获得了空前的丰收。这个社播种的一百三十八亩冬麦，每亩平均产量达到三百五十三斤，较当地互助组、单干农民的产量高出五十至八十斤左右；这个社的六百一十一亩春麦，每亩平均产量达到一百八十六斤，高出去年春麦产量四十五斤，较当地互助组、单干农民高出三十斤左右。庄稼的丰收大大增加了社员收入。根据该社制定的预分方案，每一个劳动日可以分得二十三点三斤小麦；分益最多的一户社员可以得到七千二百二十三斤小麦，最少的一户社员也分得了一千四百一十斤小麦。今年新入社的中农加马力，入社以后还有一些顾虑，只怕自己少分了粮食，他一家四个劳动力，去年单干全年只收入六千六百斤小麦，今年光夏收预分就分了小麦七千二百二十三斤。他高兴地说：“我算看到农业合作社的好处了，光夏季的收入就超过了我单干一年的收入，那里再有比农业合作社打粮更多的户儿家。”
