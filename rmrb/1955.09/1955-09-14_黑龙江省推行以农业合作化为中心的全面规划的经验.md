Heilongjiang Province's Experience in Promoting Comprehensive Planning Centered on Agricultural Cooperation
The Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

The work of agricultural cooperative comprehensive planning in Heilongjiang Province, since it was proposed during the pre-autumn farming break last year, has been gradually enriched and developed with the advancement of the agricultural cooperation movement. It has now progressed from single agricultural cooperation planning to comprehensive planning centered on agricultural cooperation. The essence of implementing comprehensive agricultural cooperation planning is to make overall arrangements and specific deployments for the socialist transformation of agriculture centered on agricultural cooperation in rural areas. This approach can, on the one hand, enhance the initiative, comprehensiveness, and planning of Party and government leaders at all levels in leading the socialist transformation of agriculture. It closely integrates agricultural cooperation with the reform of agricultural technology, the consolidation of existing agricultural production cooperatives with the active development of new cooperatives, current production with long-term construction, and the development of agriculture as the main focus while also paying attention to the development of animal husbandry, aquaculture, forestry, and other industries. This ensures that various rural economic tasks are developed comprehensively and in a planned manner in coordination. After the planning, the leadership felt that they had a good understanding of how to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture and construction in the local area. The village branch also changed the passive situation of "doing only what the superiors arrange" and can now actively study and find ways to overcome difficulties and do a good job. After the planning, the broad masses of peasants also have clear goals to strive for, greatly improving their enthusiasm for building socialism. They generally feel that "the future is bright and the mind is clear," and their enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation and production has greatly increased. They are actively carrying out technological reforms, building water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, and developing animal husbandry. Some cooperatives and groups are doing this independently, while others are doing it jointly. If there is a shortage of labor, they actively mobilize women. If there is a shortage of funds, everyone automatically raises funds. If they don't understand the technology, they take the initiative to learn. Many cooperatives have gone dozens of miles away from their homes to reclaim wasteland. The members are not afraid of hardship and work in the icy water. Everyone is active, demonstrating unparalleled socialist labor enthusiasm, making the agricultural cooperation movement truly a mass movement under the leadership of the Party. Because this work can play such a big role, it has attracted the attention of various parts of the province and is being actively promoted. Now, the process of carrying out this work in the province and some related issues are introduced below:

I. Agricultural Cooperation Planning

Under what circumstances was the method of comprehensive planning put forward? During the farming break last autumn, the agricultural cooperation movement in Heilongjiang Province had entered a high tide of great development from the trial stage. At that time, the situation was: various mutual assistance and cooperation organizations and people of all strata in rural areas had been universally mobilized to varying degrees: the original cooperatives were planning and brewing to expand their membership; the construction target groups were planning and brewing to expand their targets; and even mutual aid groups that did not meet the conditions for establishing cooperatives were also asking for further development and improvement. Some peasants were busy joining new cooperatives, some were busy joining old cooperatives, and those who were not prepared to join cooperatives this year were also actively brewing to join groups. In short, the scope of mobilization was very wide, forming a mass movement. However, because the leaders of many counties and districts failed to adapt to this situation and strengthen their leadership in a timely manner, some villages (administrative units, equivalent to townships) and villages (natural villages) produced bad phenomena in the process of peasants finding their own targets, such as "the strong finding the strong, squeezing out poor peasants," "competing for backbones, competing for members, lack of unity among each other," "blind concentration of backbones," and "rich peasants and wealthy peasants with more serious capitalist ideas taking the opportunity to organize low-level groups or engage in rich peasant cooperatives." All of these fully illustrate that in the situation of great development of agricultural cooperation, it is no longer enough to consider and implement the Party's policies and lead this movement from the scope and perspective of the new cooperatives themselves. It is necessary to proceed from the scope of the entire village and the perspective of comprehensively promoting the agricultural cooperation movement, considering both the expansion of old cooperatives and the establishment of new cooperatives; considering both the development of cooperatives and the improvement of mutual assistance groups; considering both this year and next year and even the year after that. Only in this way can we comprehensively implement the Party's policies and promote the healthy development of the agricultural cooperation movement. So, what kind of leadership method can achieve this step? The Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China assisted the Shuangcheng County Party Committee in summarizing the experience of agricultural cooperative planning in Xiqin Village last year. This experience is: under the leadership of the branch, taking the village as a unit, adopting the method of combining leadership and the masses, to carry out comprehensive planning of agricultural cooperation. Facts have proved that this method is the most appropriate method to meet the above needs. After this experience was summarized in Xiqin Village, it was promoted throughout the province.

The main contents of cooperation planning include: First, consider and formulate rough targets for the development of cooperation in the village as a whole: such as how many cooperatives are planned to be developed in total in the village, how many will be developed in which year, how large the scale of the cooperatives will be, how many households will the existing cooperatives expand, how many mutual assistance groups will be organized, which mutual assistance groups will be the key construction targets, which mutual assistance groups will be the expansion targets, and so on. Second, appropriately adjust and allocate backbone forces: such as which backbones will lead the old cooperatives, which backbones will participate in and lead the establishment of new cooperatives, which backbones will continue to lead the mutual assistance groups, the construction target groups should be equipped with key backbone forces, which masses of activists will be the training targets for leading backbones, and so on. Third, appropriately adjust the distribution of the poor and middle peasant class forces, avoid the phenomenon of "the strong finding the strong, the weak finding the weak, squeezing out poor peasants," and make appropriate arrangements for the old, weak, and disabled. Landlords and rich peasants must be properly placed and supervision strengthened. Fourth, specifically help cooperatives and groups set goals for a certain period: such as how the old cooperatives can be further consolidated and improved, how the new cooperatives that have been determined to be established can be planned and formally built, and how mutual assistance groups can do a good job in production to create conditions for establishing cooperatives.

The general work procedures for carrying out planning are: The first step is to assist the village branch in finding out the basic conditions of the existing cooperatives in the village, the ideological trends of peasants of all strata, the foundation of mutual assistance groups, and the situation of leading backbones, and on this basis, initially formulate a comprehensive plan for cooperation in the village. The second step is to train and improve leading backbones. The training method is to fully discuss the village branch's planning plan among the leading backbones, conduct education in the discussion, open up thinking and improve understanding, and on the basis of improving awareness, form a leading core with cooperatives and groups as units; then, through backbone individual connections, educate and organize the masses. The third step is to conduct extensive and in-depth ideological education targeting the ideological situation of peasants of all strata. The main contents of education include: the superiority of cooperatives, the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, the purpose and conditions for running cooperatives, the class line, and so on. The fourth step is to form agricultural production cooperatives or mutual assistance groups separately on a voluntary basis through individual connections of backbones on the basis of improving mass awareness. The fifth step is to help each cooperative and group formulate their own goals and implementation plans. The sixth step is to organize a mutual assistance and cooperation network, establish a contact system between cooperatives and groups, cultivate them with the cooperatives leading the groups in a planned and targeted manner, and at the same time launch a bottom-up "registration" to actively create conditions for establishing cooperatives.

The actual results of the promotion prove that the important role of carrying out agricultural cooperation planning lies in: First, through planning, we can further understand the bottom line of rural areas, comprehensively implement the Party's policies, and closely combine the plans of county and district leading organs with the demands of the masses, so that the plans of the leading organs are more in line with reality and have a mass foundation, and the demands of the peasants can be correctly led and strongly supported. In this way, we can avoid the blindness of leadership and the spontaneity of the masses, overcome both the conservative thinking and laissez-faire tendencies in leadership, and prevent the tendency of rashness and coercion, and correctly implement the policy of "active leadership and steady progress." For example, in the spring of 1954, Shuangcheng County planned to develop 400 cooperatives. After the agricultural cooperative planning during the farming break, the number of people who voluntarily "registered" to request the establishment of cooperatives exceeded the original number. Based on this situation, the county party committee revised the original plan to ensure the healthy development of the cooperative movement. Second, through planning, the work of developing cooperation is specifically deployed to the grassroots leadership and the broad masses, making the branch clear on how to lead, the old cooperatives clear on how to develop forward, the new cooperatives clear on how to establish, and the mutual assistance groups clear on the specific direction of improvement, greatly giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the village branch and the broad masses. For example, after the implementation of planning in some places last year, many mutual assistance groups that voluntarily registered to request the establishment of cooperatives actively created conditions under the leadership of the branch, took the initiative to visit and learn from the old cooperatives, and prepared for the establishment of cooperatives on their own, which are all new phenomena that have not occurred in previous years. Third, through planning, we can more comprehensively implement the Party's class policy in rural areas: on the one hand, avoid the phenomenon of squeezing out poor and middle peasants, and strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants; on the other hand, make appropriate arrangements for poor peasants who voluntarily join the cooperatives and those who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperatives, and effectively restrict the development and sabotage activities of rich peasant capitalism. Fourth, we can appropriately allocate backbone forces from the perspective of overall cooperative interests: we can take care of the consolidation and expansion of old cooperatives, and also take care of the establishment and development of new cooperatives; we can take care of the development of cooperatives, and also take care of the consolidation and improvement of mutual assistance groups; we can take care of this year, and also take care of next year and even the year after that, so that we can closely connect the relationship between cooperatives and cooperatives, and between cooperatives and groups, and comprehensively promote the agricultural cooperation movement in a planned manner. Fifth, after the planning, the work of developing cooperatives can be prepared in a planned and orderly manner throughout the year, developing a batch when it is mature, and consolidating, cultivating, and improving at the same time, avoiding the various problems that may occur during a short-term rush.

Since Heilongjiang Province began to promote the experience of comprehensive planning last autumn, the situation of the promotion has been extremely uneven. The more than 4,000 villages that have initially carried out planning can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is those who have adhered to the working method of the mass line, correctly implemented the Party's policies, initially achieved practical results, and are continuing to implement them. This category is in the minority. The second category is formalism, simply setting a plan target and announcing it to the masses, but the actual problems have not been solved. This category accounts for the majority. The third category is coercion and command, violating the principle of voluntariness, turning the planning into an administrative order to form groups and cooperatives, and even forcing the masses to sign guarantees to implement them, which seriously affects the enthusiasm of the masses for production and mutual assistance and cooperation. Some reflect: "We are stuck with it, we can't escape." These situations show that great efforts are still needed to do a good job in the comprehensive planning of agricultural cooperation in Heilongjiang Province.

Based on the experience and lessons of promoting comprehensive planning during this period, the following links must be paid attention to in order to do a good job in the comprehensive planning of agricultural cooperation: First, the cadres who carry out the work must first clarify the situation and characteristics of the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement and what principles and policies must be followed to lead this movement. Because the process of "combining leadership with mass voluntariness and carrying out comprehensive planning" is essentially a process of comprehensively implementing the Party's guidelines and policies, specifically deploying and leading the great development of cooperation. Second, we must absolutely abide by and conscientiously implement the working method of the mass line. The planning process is an arduous process of education and meticulous organizational work. The method of comprehensive planning is a method of combining leadership with the masses to guide the masses forward. Therefore, in practical work, we must patiently educate, connect individually, and mobilize at all levels from within the Party to outside the Party, from backbones to the masses, and voluntarily unite. If we deviate from the working method of the mass line, the planning will not only fail to achieve the expected results, but will also have the opposite effect. Third, we must rely closely on the branch and give play to the strength of various organizations in rural areas and use the mutual assistance and cooperation network.

II. Production Planning Centered on Cooperation

Production planning was put forward after the large-scale development of cooperatives last winter and this spring. At that time, the situation was: the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province had developed to more than 22,000, and the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounted for more than 35% of the total number of peasant households in the province. The proportion of labor, land, livestock, and farm tools in the cooperatives reached about 40%. This huge change in rural production relations has further liberated the rural productive forces under the constraints of the small peasant economy. According to surveys, the labor efficiency of cooperatives in the first year of establishment generally increased by 15% to 20% compared with mutual assistance groups, and the utilization efficiency of livestock increased by 20% to 25% compared with mutual assistance groups. Due to the increased utilization efficiency of livestock, farm tools, and other means of production in cooperatives, it is possible to extract a portion of the productive forces to invest in new production. Calculated according to the above ratio, if the 22,000 cooperatives in the province are run well, there will be 150,000 laborers, more than 100,000 livestock, and huge amounts of funds that can be used for expanded reproduction. This is a huge batch of productive forces. At the same time, with the continuous development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the future, the trend of increasing productive forces will become more and more obvious and prominent. However, because the leadership failed to adapt to this new situation and strengthen leadership, and failed to correspondingly enrich new production content, abnormal phenomena such as labor rotation and layoffs, squeezing out the old, weak, and female labor force from participating in production, a considerable number of livestock being squeezed out of the cooperatives, and waste of large amounts of funds have become more common in cooperatives. Members feel that there is no way out for production, reflecting that "there are many people and few jobs, and production is not satisfying." Under this situation, poor peasants are anxious, middle peasants begin to doubt whether cooperatives can increase production and income, and a small number of wealthy members do not care about production in the cooperatives and engage in "one foot in the door and one foot out of the door." Under the circumstance that cooperatives find their own way out, the phenomenon of blind production and engaging in capitalist management continues to occur. The above situation fully shows that with the development of agricultural cooperation, it is necessary to reform agricultural technology accordingly and enrich new production content. In order to meet the new requirements put forward by the huge growth of agricultural productive forces, it is not enough to adopt the management methods of the past small peasant economy or the piecemeal measures of the trial period of cooperatives; it is urgently needed to plan comprehensively, reform agricultural technology in a planned way, carry out agricultural infrastructure construction, and expand production content. In order to adapt to this requirement, the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in the winter of last year, assisted the Shuangcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China in summarizing the experience of production planning centered on cooperation on the basis of implementing the experience of comprehensive cooperation planning; Further production planning was carried out on the basis of cooperation planning, so that cooperation and development of production could be closely integrated and promote each other.

The content of production planning mainly includes three aspects: First, how to increase the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land. This includes measures such as popularizing new agricultural implements, planting high-yield and stable-yield crops, applying more fertilizer, promoting improved varieties, improving cultivation methods, and preventing natural disasters. Second, how to increase production content and expand the scope of production in accordance with local conditions, and carry out infrastructure construction in a planned way. This mainly includes how to reclaim wasteland to expand the area of cultivated land, build water conservancy projects to develop paddy fields, and develop animal husbandry, aquaculture, forestry and other productions. Third, according to the needs of production planning, further enrich and revise the plan for developing agricultural cooperation.

The general methods and steps for carrying out planning are: First, find the key to increasing production, tap the potential of resources, and find out the ways to increase production and the situation of resources; Second, carry out economic zoning, adjust and rationally utilize resources, and specifically plan which areas should focus on grasping which key links to increase production, and combine to develop which productions; Which wasteland, pastures, water conservancy, forest land, and fish ponds should be reclaimed or constructed by which district, village, cooperative, or group. Third, specifically formulate the production and construction plans for the county, district, village, cooperative, and group for the current year and for three to five years. For agricultural infrastructure construction that needs to be carried out jointly by the whole village, the branch leads the cooperatives to unite the mutual assistance groups and individual peasants to carry it out together. Production and construction that needs to be carried out jointly by several cooperatives and groups should be carried out voluntarily by the cooperatives and groups. Production and construction that is carried out independently by the cooperatives and groups should be planned separately by the cooperatives and groups. Fourth, formulate the main measures to ensure the realization of the plan and the current specific action plan. In general, the method of combining top-down progressive planning and bottom-up mobilization of the masses is adopted.

At present, the situation of promoting this experience in the province is: Shuangcheng and Keshan counties have universally promoted production planning in the whole county, and 25 counties have tried it in one district; The county has made a production plan, and only 27 counties have conducted pilot projects in one village; 12 counties have not carried out planning at all. The general situation is: more than 60 districts and more than 1,120 villages in the province have carried out production planning.

All those who have carried out production planning correctly and have been able to persist in organizing and implementing it in their daily work have achieved good results. The potential of agricultural production has been extensively tapped, the content of agricultural production and construction has been enriched, and the cooperative movement and the reform of agricultural technology to expand production have been closely combined at a new level. On the one hand, it has greatly promoted the improvement of agricultural productive forces and the development of agricultural production, and on the other hand, it has enriched the cooperative movement with rich production content, which has effectively consolidated and promoted the agricultural cooperation movement. Through production planning, Keshan County has found more than 16,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of reclaimable wasteland and discovered more than 250 usable water sources, which can develop more than 7,000 hectares of paddy fields. This year, Keshan County has reclaimed more than 6,000 hectares of dry land and more than 400 hectares of paddy fields. There are more than 200 cooperatives in the county that have organized distant farming teams to leave their villages to reclaim wasteland. The Heping Cooperative alone has reclaimed 300 hectares of wasteland this year. This year, 22 cooperatives and 8 mutual assistance groups in District 7 of Lalin County raised 6,000 yuan to jointly build two pumping stations, which reclaimed 237 hectares of paddy fields (and can reclaim 400 hectares next year), and can harvest a total of 1,422,000 catties of rice. 56 cooperatives jointly established a demonstration livestock farm. The three "Su Gao Xue" stallions of this farm have mated with 96 foreign foals. According to the characteristics of the soil quality in the area, District 9 of Zhaodong County focused on improving micro-alkaline soil in this year's production plan. More than 40 cooperatives in the district improved a total of 1,230 hectares of micro-alkaline soil, overcoming the phenomenon of "dead seedlings" and "rust seedlings," and it is estimated that each hectare of land can increase production by at least one dan of grain. After production planning, 78 cooperatives in District 11 of Shuangcheng County promoted a total of 52 sets of new-style animal-powered agricultural implements this year. A total of 1,326 hectares of land were sown with new-style agricultural implements; 150,000 catties of Cooperative No. 3 wheat seeds were promoted, and 518 hectares were sown; 107 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed. The combined effect of these three items alone can increase production by 3,774 dan of grain. At the same time, three villages, led by cooperatives, jointly built three fish ponds. These are all unprecedented initiatives in the eyes of the local peasants, which have greatly improved the enthusiasm of the peasants to take the road of cooperation. Old Wu Tou of Wujia Village in Shuangcheng County said: "I have lived a lifetime and never thought that our village could open up paddy fields and raise fish. Chairman Mao has pointed out that this cooperative road is really good." The peasants who have already joined the cooperatives are more active and wholeheartedly devoted to running the cooperatives well. The wavering ones have now turned to stability, some of those who have withdrawn from the cooperatives have expressed regret, and the peasants who have not joined the cooperatives are all very "envious." Many mutual assistance groups are actively creating conditions and requesting to establish cooperatives or join old cooperatives after the autumn of this year. In particular, the leading role of cooperative and group joint production for mutual assistance groups is even greater. From these situations, it can be seen that production planning is a further development of cooperation planning and an indispensable and important part of cooperation planning. That is to say, on the one hand, cooperation planning has opened up broad prospects and laid a solid foundation for further planned development of agricultural production; on the other hand, production planning has enriched and enriched cooperation planning with production and construction content and provided a guarantee for realizing the purpose of cooperation planning. Only by closely integrating these two aspects of planning and promoting each other can we better realize the socialist transformation of agriculture and develop rural productive forces.

However, judging from the situation in the province, production planning has been done well in only a few districts and villages, and formalism is more serious in most districts and villages. Some simply base their plans on the plan of the County Committee of the Communist Party of China without grasping the main key to increasing production in their locality; some only make plans sitting in the house without fully mobilizing the masses; some have planned well, but failed to conscientiously organize and implement them, resulting in formalism. At the same time, many shortcomings and deviations have also occurred in the planning work: for example, in handling the relationship between agriculture and sideline occupations, they have focused on developing diversified operations and ignored increasing the yield per unit area of farmland, and some have even changed good land to plant fruit trees; in handling the relationship between the interests of the state and the interests of the cooperatives, on the one hand, there is a tendency to rely solely on state loans regardless of the interests of the state, and on the other hand, there is also a phenomenon of mechanically requiring cooperatives to implement state plans; in handling the relationship between the collective interests of the cooperatives and the personal interests of the members, some cooperatives emphasize the collective in everything, and even want to incorporate chicks and ducklings into the unified management of the cooperatives; in handling production and life problems, some cooperatives blindly expand life consumption; in many places, there is a phenomenon of blindly greedy for more and bigger, doing everything but grasping the main ones, and the masses reflect that the cooperatives have too big appetites and want to swallow the sun in one bite, and so on.

According to the experience and lessons of promoting production planning in various places, the following links must be paid attention to in order to do a good job in production planning: First, production planning must be carried out by combining top-down progressive planning with bottom-up mobilization of the masses. Because on the one hand, only by first planning progressively from top to bottom can we implement overall planning, take care of the overall situation, and inspire the enthusiasm of the lower levels, so that the lower levels have something to follow when carrying out planning; on the other hand, only by fully mobilizing the peasant masses, giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses for construction, and relying on the experience and wisdom of the masses can we make the production planning go smoothly and turn the planning into practical actions for the masses to consciously build. Second, production planning must be centered on agricultural cooperation, rely closely on the cooperatives, unite and lead the mutual assistance groups and the broad masses of peasants, and closely combine it with rectifying, consolidating, and promoting the current agricultural cooperation movement. In places where cooperation planning has already been carried out, it should be carried out on the basis of cooperation planning. In places where cooperation planning has not been carried out, it should be carried out in conjunction with cooperation planning. From the perspective of improving production, it can better inspire the masses' requirements and enthusiasm for cooperation. Third, production planning cannot be planned in any way, but must reflect the Party's guidelines and policies for leading agricultural production, so that the development of agricultural production meets the needs of national industrial construction and advances along the requirements of gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture. Therefore, we must pay attention to grasping the principle of combining personal interests with cooperative interests, collective interests with national interests, and current interests with long-term interests; we must implement the principle of taking agriculture as the main focus and combining it with actively and plannedly developing rural production in an all-round way; the speed of development must not only have an active spirit, but also be built on a reliable foundation; the investment in production should mainly rely on the strength of the masses, implement the spirit of increasing production and saving, and try to achieve small investment and great results; at the same time, we should actively and steadily expand the cooperative economic front, strengthen socialist accumulation, and thoroughly implement the Party's three-in-one class policy in rural areas.

III. Strengthening Party Leadership is Key to Realizing Comprehensive Planning of Agricultural Cooperation

In the process of realizing the comprehensive planning of agricultural cooperation, many new situations and problems were encountered. In order to ensure that the planning work is effectively implemented, we must improve and strengthen Party leadership from the following aspects.

First, the leadership must change the work style of unplanned and pushed work and the guerrilla习气 of not paying attention to the implementation of the plan, and considering the plan as completed after it is completed, and establish a strong planning concept and guide the work according to the plan. District 11 of Shuangcheng County adopted the leadership method of grasping the plan by season and by section. According to the requirements of the overall plan, combined with the specific situation of each season and each section, it grasped the main key, formulated a specific implementation plan, and then specifically arranged the plan to the village, village, cooperative, and group to organize the implementation by helping the village and cooperative to check the implementation of the plan and study future measures. As a result, it not only effectively guided the current production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, but also guaranteed the realization of long-term construction plans by doing a good job in the current production of cooperatives and groups.

Second, the implementation of comprehensive planning requires the leadership to change the general call and the general work style of simply urging to work and rushing progress, and to truly go deep into the production process of the cooperatives and specifically guide the economic activities of the cooperatives. After the comprehensive planning, the cooperatives have rich content of production and construction, and the next problem is that the management level of the cooperatives is far behind the needs of production development. For example, labor efficiency is not high, production quality is rough, idling and waste are serious, financial management is chaotic, and so on. These all fully reflect that the responsibility for directly managing production has been transferred from individual peasants to the management institutions of the cooperatives after the transfer from groups to cooperatives, and the peasants lack experience in managing the collective economy, and the Party urgently needs to strengthen specific guidance. The Shuangcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China grasped this urgent problem that needs to be solved in the current economic activities of the cooperatives, deeply studied the management experience of the old cooperatives, and made it systematic and institutionalized, and then promoted it, effectively helping the broad masses of cooperatives to improve their management work, ensuring the realization of the production plans of each cooperative, and promoting the implementation of production planning centered on cooperation. This approach is good.

Third, the implementation of comprehensive planning requires the leadership to change the tendency of grasping the cooperatives in isolation and abandoning the mutual assistance groups in the leadership of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, and to adhere to the practice of leading the groups with the cooperatives. According to the experience of various places, the better method is: on the basis of the agricultural cooperation plan, organize a mutual assistance and cooperation network, establish a contact system between cooperatives and groups, specifically help solve the problems in the mutual assistance groups, pay attention to absorbing them to participate in some relevant meetings of the cooperatives, help the mutual assistance groups train backbones, and familiarize themselves with the cooperative policies and the knowledge of running the cooperatives, especially should help the mutual assistance groups solve the difficulties in production, absorb them to jointly reclaim wasteland, build water conservancy projects to expand production. This is the most practical education for the peasants outside the cooperatives.

Fourth, the implementation of comprehensive planning requires the leadership to change the single-handed work style and strengthen the leadership of the overall economic work in rural areas. The implementation of comprehensive planning has put forward many new requirements for other economic work in rural areas: the promotion of new-style animal-powered agricultural implements, the construction of water conservancy projects, the development of paddy fields, and the development of animal husbandry require strong technical guidance; the agricultural infrastructure construction needs to concentrate the surplus capital scattered in the hands of the peasants; some new means of production required require the supply and marketing cooperatives to actively cooperate. Adapting to this new situation, the Shuangcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China paid attention to strengthening the leadership of other economic work. In terms of technical guidance, it strengthened the leadership of the technology promotion station, enriched and improved the new-style agricultural implement technicians in the station, added water conservancy and animal husbandry technicians, and universally established technology teaching stations in each district, and the county trained a total of 2,726 new-style agricultural implement technicians and 1,085 breeders and livestock breeders for the cooperatives. In terms of credit work, in addition to paying attention to reasonable loans, it vigorously developed the credit cooperative business, and the county developed from three cooperatives last year to 33 cooperatives, with a deposit balance of 280,000 yuan. In terms of material supply, the new or important means of production needed for developing production were designated to specialized supply and marketing cooperatives to be responsible for, and contracts were signed to ensure supply. Individual strong leaders also promoted "triangular contracts." These have played an extremely important role in supporting and promoting the realization of comprehensive planning.

Fifth, the process of realizing comprehensive planning is a process of fierce struggle between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology, and between advanced ideology and conservative ideology. Therefore, strengthening the Party's ideological education work for the peasants and giving play to the fighting fortress role of the branch are the political driving force and guarantee for realizing comprehensive planning. The reason why Wujia Village in Shuangcheng County was able to overcome difficulties at all levels and finally build water conservancy projects and plant paddy fields that had never been planted in the history of Wujia Village was because the strong fortress role of the branch: not bowing to difficulties, constantly educating and encouraging the peasants' enthusiasm for building socialism, uniting and giving play to the wisdom and creativity of the peasant masses, played a decisive role.

    黑龙江省推行以农业合作化为中心的全面规划的经验
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部
    农业合作化全面规划的工作，在黑龙江省自从去年秋前挂锄期间提出以后，随着农业合作化运动的推进，在逐渐地充实和逐渐地发展。现在已由单项的农业合作化规划，进到了以农业合作化为中心的全面规划。实行农业合作化全面规划的实质就是将以农业合作化为中心的农业社会主义改造事业，在农村中做了统筹的安排和具体的布置。这样做一方面可以提高各级党和政府领导农业社会主义改造事业的主动性、全面性和计划性，把农业合作化和改革农业技术、把认真巩固现有农业生产合作社和积极发展新社、把当前生产和长远建设、把发展农业为主同时注意畜牧、水产、林业等事业的发展密切结合起来，使农村各项经济工作得以全面有计划地配合发展。规划之后，领导方面觉得对当地怎样进行农业社会主义改造，怎样进行建设，心里有数了。村支部也改变了“上级布置点才干点”的被动局面，能主动地研究和想办法克服困难做好工作。规划之后，也使广大农民群众有明确的努力目标，大大提高了农民群众建设社会主义的热情，普遍感到“前途美满、心里亮堂”，互助合作和生产积极性大大提高；积极进行改革技术、兴修水利、开垦荒地、发展畜牧。有的社、组单独进行，有的社、组联合进行；劳动力不足的积极发动妇女；资金不足的大家自动集资；不懂技术的主动去学。不少合作社离家到几十里路以外的地方去开荒。社员不怕吃苦，在冰冷的水里劳动，个个积极，表现出无比的社会主义劳动热情，使农业合作化运动真正成为在党的领导下的广大群众性的运动。这项工作因为它能够起到这样大的作用，已引起本省各地重视和积极地推广。现在把全省进行这项工作的经过和一些有关的问题介绍于下：
    一、农业合作化规划
    全面规划的方法是在什么样情况下提出来的？在去年挂锄期间，黑龙江省农业合作化运动已由试办阶段进入了大发展的高潮。当时的情况是：农村各种互助合作组织和各阶层群众，已程度不同地普遍动起来：原有的合作社正在筹划酝酿扩大社员；建社对象组正在筹划酝酿扩充对象；不够建社条件的互助组也要求进一步发展和提高。农民群众有的张罗入新社，有的张罗入老社，当年不准备入社的也在积极酝酿插组。总之，动的面很广，形成了一个群众性的运动。但是由于不少县、区领导未能适应这个形势及时加强领导，致使部分村（行政单位，相当于乡）、屯（自然村）农民群众在自找对象中产生了“强找强，排挤贫困农民”、“争骨干、争社员，相互间不团结”、“骨干盲目集中”、“富农和资本主义思想较严重的富裕农民，趁机组织低级组或搞富农社”等不好的现象。这些都充分说明了在农业合作化大发展的形势下，光是从新社本身这个范围和角度出发考虑和贯彻党的政策和领导这个运动已经不够了。必须从全村范围和全面推进农业合作化运动的角度出发，既考虑到老社的扩大，也考虑到新社的建立；既考虑到合作社的发展，也考虑到互助组的提高；既考虑到今年，也考虑到明年以至后年。只有这样才能全面地贯彻党的政策，使农业合作化运动健康地向前发展。那么用什么样的领导方法才能作到这一步呢？中共黑龙江省委员会农村工作部协助双城县委总结了去年希勤村农业合作化规划的经验。这个经验就是：在支部领导下，以村为单位，采取领导和群众相结合的方法，进行农业合作化的全面规划。事实证明：这个办法是适应上述需要的最恰当的办法。这个经验在希勤村总结出来之后，又在全省范围内进行了推广。
    合作化规划的内容主要包括：第一、通盘考虑订出本村合作化发展的大致指标：如全村计划总共发展多少社，哪年发展多少，合作社规模多大，现有社扩大多少户，组织多少个互助组，哪几个互助组做为重点培养的建社对象，哪几个互助组做为扩社对象，等等。第二、适当调整和配备骨干力量：如哪些骨干领导老社，哪些骨干参加和领导建立新社，哪些骨干继续领导互助组，建社对象组应重点配备骨干力量，有哪些群众积极分子作为领导骨干的培养对象，等等。第三、适当调整贫农和中农阶级力量的分布，避免“强找强，弱找弱，排挤贫困农民”的现象，对老弱残疾适当安排。对地主富农必须适当安插，加强监督。第四、具体帮助社、组定出一定时期的努力目标：如老社如何进一步巩固和提高，已经确定建立的新社如何筹划正式建成，互助组如何搞好生产为建社创造条件。
    进行规划的一般工作程序是：第一步协助村支部摸清本村现有社的基本状况，各阶层农民的思想动态，互助组基础和领导骨干情况，在此基础上初步制定本村合作化规划方案。第二步训练和提高领导骨干。训练的方法是将村支部的规划方案在领导骨干中进行充分讨论，在讨论中进行教育，打通思想提高认识，并在提高觉悟的基础上，以社、组为单位组成领导核心；然后通过骨干个别串连教育和组织群众。第三步针对各阶层农民思想情况，广泛深入地进行思想教育。教育内容主要包括：合作社优越性，自愿互利政策，办社的目的和条件，阶级路线等。第四步在提高群众觉悟的基础上，通过骨干个别串连，自愿联合，分别组成农业生产合作社或互助组。第五步帮助各社、组制定奋斗目标和实施计划。第六步组织互助合作网、建立社、组联系制度，以社带组，有计划、有对象地进行培养，同时发动自下而上“报名挂号”，积极为建社创造条件。
    推行所收到的实际效果证明，进行农业合作化规划的重要作用在于：第一、通过规划可以进一步摸清农村的底，具体全面地贯彻党的政策，把县、区领导机关计划同群众要求密切结合起来，使领导机关的计划，更加切合实际，有群众基础，使农民群众的要求能够得到正确的领导和有力支持。这样就可以避免领导的盲目性和群众的自发性，既可克服领导上的保守思想和放任自流偏向，又可防止急躁冒进和强迫命令的偏向，正确贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针。如双城县一九五四年春计划发展四百个社，经挂锄期农业合作化规划，自愿“报名挂号”要求建社的超过了原来预定的数字很多。县委根据这个情况，修改了原订计划，保证了合作化运动健康地向前发展。第二、通过规划实际上就把农业合作化大发展工作具体布置到基层领导和广大群众，使支部明确了如何领导，使老社明确了如何向前发展，使新社明确了如何进行建立，使互助组明确了提高的具体方向，大大发挥了村支部和广大群众的主动性和积极性。如去年有些地方实行规划以后，很多自愿报名要求建社的互助组，在支部的领导下，积极创造条件，自动到老社参观学习，自己动手酝酿筹备建社，这都是历年所没有的新气象。第三、通过规划可以更全面地贯彻党在农村的阶级政策：一方面避免排挤贫农和中农的现象，加强了贫农和中农的团结；另一方面使自愿入社和暂时不愿入社的贫农得到了适当安排，有力地限制了富农资本主义的发展和破坏活动。第四、可以从全面合作化利益着眼，适当配备骨干力量：既可照顾老社的巩固和扩大，也可照顾新社的建立和发展；既可照顾了合作社的发展，也可照顾互助组的巩固和提高；既照顾了今年，也照顾了明年以至后年，从而就可以密切社同社、社同组的关系，有计划地全面地推进农业合作化运动。第五、进行了规划，就可以使发展合作社工作，得以常年有计划有秩序地进行准备，成熟一批发展一批，边建立边巩固边培养，避免短时突击可能发生的种种毛病。
    黑龙江全省自去年秋季开始推广全面规划的经验以来，推广的好坏情况极不平衡。已经初步进行规划的四千多个村，大体可以分为三类：第一类，坚持了群众路线的工作方法，正确地贯彻了党的政策，初步收到了实际效果，并正在继续贯彻。这类是少数。第二类，形式主义，只是简单地订个计划指标，向群众一宣布，实际问题并没有解决。这类占多数。第三类，强迫命令，违反自愿原则，把规划变成了行政命令编组、编社，甚至强迫群众签名保证执行，结果严重地影响了群众生产和互助合作积极性。有的反映：“上了牛皮文书，没跑了。”这些情况说明：在黑龙江全省作好农业合作化的全面规划尚须作极大的努力。
    根据这个时期推广全面规划的经验和教训，作好农业合作化规划工作，必须注意掌握如下几个环节：第一，就是要使进行工作的干部首先明确农业合作化运动大发展的形势和特点以及领导这个运动必须遵循什么方针，掌握哪些原则政策。因为“领导同群众自愿结合，全面进行规划”的过程，实质就是全面贯彻党的方针政策、具体布置和领导合作化大发展的过程。第二，必须绝对遵守认真贯彻群众路线的工作方法。规划的过程，是一个艰苦的教育工作和细致的组织工作过程。全面规划的方法就是领导同群众相结合引导群众前进的方法。因此，在实际工作当中，要耐心教育，个别串连，从党内到党外，从骨干到群众，层层发动，自愿联合。如果离开了群众路线的工作方法，规划不但不会收到预期的效果，而且会起相反的作用。第三，必须紧紧依靠支部，并发挥农村中的各种组织力量和运用互助合作网。
    二、以合作化为中心的生产规划
    生产规划是在去冬今春合作社大量发展之后提出来的。当时的情况是：全省农业生产合作社已发展到两万二千多个，参加农业生产合作社的农户已占全省总农户的百分之三十五以上。合作社的劳动力、土地、耕畜、农具比重达百分之四十左右。农村生产关系这个巨大变革，进一步解放了小农经济束缚下的农村生产力。据调查，建社头一年合作社的劳动效率比互助组一般提高百分之十五到二十，耕畜运用效率比互助组提高百分之二十到二十五。由于合作社的耕畜、农具等生产资料运用效率提高，就有可能抽出一部分生产力投向新的生产。以上述比例计算，全省两万二千个合作社，如果办的好，将有十五万个劳动力、十万多匹耕畜和巨量资金可以用于扩大再生产。这是一批巨大的生产力。同时随着今后农业合作化运动的不断发展，生产力增加的趋势将越来越加明显和突出。但由于领导未能适应这个新的情况加强领导，相应地充实新的生产内容，因而在合作社中较普遍地出现了劳动力轮班歇工、排挤老弱和妇女劳动力参加生产、相当数量的耕畜被排挤在社外、大批资金浪费等不正常现象。社员们感到生产无出路，反映：“人多活少，生产不解渴”。在这种情况下贫农着急，中农对合作社能否增加生产、增加收入开始怀疑，少数富裕社员，不关心社内生产，搞“一脚门里，一脚门外”。在合作社自找出路的情况下，不断发生盲目生产和搞资本主义经营的现象。上述情况，充分说明了，随着农业合作化的发展，必须相应地改革农业技术，充实新的生产内容。为了满足由于农业生产力巨大增长而提出的新的要求，采取过去小农经济的经营方法或试办合作社时期那些零碎措施已经不够了；迫切需要通盘规划，有计划地改革农业技术，进行农业基本建设，扩大生产内容。为了适应这种要求，中共黑龙江省委员会农村工作部在去年冬季协助中共双城县委员会，在实行合作化全面规划经验的基础上，总结了以合作化为中心的生产规划的经验；在合作化规划的基础上，进一步进行生产规划，使合作化和发展生产密切结合起来，相互推动。
    生产规划的内容主要有三个方面：第一、如何提高现有耕地面积产量。包括如何推广新式农具、种植高产稳产作物、增施肥料、推广优良品种、改进耕作方法和防治自然灾害等措施。第二、如何因地制宜地，增加生产内容，扩大生产范围，有计划地进行基本建设。其中主要包括如何开荒扩大耕地面积、兴修水利发展水田、发展畜牧、水产、林业等生产。第三、根据生产规划的需要，进一步充实和修订发展农业合作化的计划。
    进行规划的一般方法和步骤是：第一步、找增产关键，挖资源潜力，摸清增产途径和资源情况；第二步、进行经济区划，调整和合理利用资源，具体规划出哪些地区重点应抓住哪些增产环节，结合发展哪些生产；哪些荒原、牧场、水利、林地、鱼池由哪个区、村、社、组开垦或建设。第三步、具体制定出县、区、村、社、组当年和三、五年的生产建设计划。需要全村共同进行的农业基本建设，就在支部领导下以社带组，团结个体农民共同进行。需要几个社、组共同进行建设的，由社、组自愿联合进行。属于社、组单独进行的生产和建设，由社、组分别计划进行。第四步、订出保证实现计划的主要措施和当前的具体行动方案。总的是采取自上而下逐级规划和自下而上发动群众结合的方法进行。
    目前全省推广这项经验的情况是：在全县范围内普遍推行生产规划的有双城、克山两个县，试行一个区的有二十五个县；县已做出生产规划方案，只在一个村进行试点的有二十七个县；根本未进行规划的有十二个县。总的情况是：全省已有六十多个区和一千一百二十多个村进行了生产规划工作。
    凡是正确进行了生产规划，并且能够在日常工作中坚持组织贯彻的都收到了良好效果。广泛地挖掘了农业生产潜力，丰富了农业生产建设内容，使合作化运动和改革农业技术扩大生产，在新的水平上密切结合起来。一方面大大促进了农业生产力的提高和农业生产的发展，另一方面使农业合作化运动有了丰富的生产内容，有力地巩固和推进了农业合作化运动。克山县通过生产规划，找出了一万六千多垧（每垧十五市亩）可垦的荒地，发现了二百五十余处可以利用的水源，共可开发水田七千多垧。今年克山县已开垦旱田六千多垧，水田四百多垧。全县共有二百多个社组织了远耕队离开本村开荒。和平社一个社今年就开垦了三百垧荒地。拉林县七区二十二个社、八个互助组，今年集资六千元联合建设了两处抽水站，共开垦了二百三十七垧水田（明年还能开四百垧），共可收获一百四十二万二千斤水稻。有五十六个合作社联合创办了一处示范牧畜场。这个场的三匹“苏高雪”种马已配出了九十六匹洋马驹。肇东县九区根据本区土质特点，在今年的生产规划中集中抓住了改良微堿性土壤，全区有四十多个合作社共改良了一千二百三十垧微堿性土地，克服了“死苗”和“锈苗”现象，估计每垧地至少可增产一石粮食。双城县十一区经过生产规划，有七十八个合作社今年共推广了五十二套新式畜力农具。共用新式农具播种一千三百二十六垧地；推广合作三号麦种十五万斤，播种五百一十八垧；开荒一百零七垧。仅这三项合集起来即可增产三千七百七十四石粮食。同时有三个村以社带组联合修建了三处养鱼池。这些在当地农民看来，都是历史上所没有的创举，大大提高了农民走合作化道路的积极性。双城县吴家村老吴头说：“我活了一辈子也没想到咱这村也能开水田、养鱼，毛主席指给这条合作化道路真好。”已经入社的农民更加积极，一心朴实的搞好合作社。动摇的现在已转向稳定，退了社的有些人已表示后悔，没有入社的农民看着都非常“眼热”，不少互助组都积极创造条件，要求今年秋后建社或加入老社，特别是社、组联合生产的对互助组的带头作用就更大。从这些情况可以看出：生产规划乃是合作化规划的进一步发展，是合作化规划的不可缺少的重要组成部分。也就是说，一方面，合作化规划，给进一步有计划地发展农业生产开辟了广阔的前途，奠定了有力的基础；另一方面，生产规划又给合作化规划充实和丰富了生产建设内容，给实现合作化规划的目的提供了保证。只有将这两个方面规划密切结合起来相互推动，才能更好地实现农业社会主义改造，发展农村生产力。
    但就全省情况看来，生产规划搞得好的还是少数区、村，多数区、村形式主义比较严重，有的只简单根据本县中共县委员会规划的方案往下套，没有抓住本地增产的主要关键；有的光是坐在屋子里做计划，没有充分发动群众；有的规划得虽然较好，但未能认真组织贯彻执行，结果流于形式。同时在规划工作中，还产生许多缺点和偏差：如在处理农业同副业关系上偏重发展多种经营，忽视提高农田单位面积产量，有的竟将好地改种了果树；在处理国家同合作社利益关系上，一方面有不顾国家利益单纯依靠国家贷款的偏向，另一方面，也有机械要求合作社执行国家计划的现象；在处理社的集体利益和社员个人利益的关系上，有些事事强调集体，甚至要把小鸡小鸭也纳入合作社统一经营；在处理生产和生活问题上有的合作社盲目扩大生活消费；不少地方有盲目贪多贪大的现象，样样都搞抓不住主要的，群众反映合作社胃口太大了，想一口吞个日头，等等。
    根据各地推行生产规划的经验和教训，搞好生产规划必须注意以下几个环节：第一、生产规划必须采取自上而下逐级规划和自下而上发动群众相结合的方法进行。因为一方面只有首先从上而下地逐级规划，才能贯彻统盘筹划、照顾全局，启发下面的积极性，使下面进行规划时有所遵循；另一方面只有充分发动农民群众，发挥群众的建设热情，依靠群众的经验和智慧，才能使生产规划顺利进行，把规划真正变为群众自觉建设的实际行动。第二、生产规划必须以农业合作化为中心，紧紧依靠合作社，团结带动互助组和广大农民群众进行，并同整顿巩固推进当前农业合作化运动密切结合起来。已经进行合作化规划的地方，应在合作化规划的基础上进行，没有进行合作化规划的地方，应同合作化规划结合起来进行，从提高生产着眼，可以更好地启发群众合作化的要求和积极性。第三、生产规划并不是怎样规划都可以，而是必须体现党的领导农业生产的方针政策，使农业生产的发展符合于国家工业建设的需要，沿着逐步实现对农业社会主义改造的要求前进。因此，必须注意掌握个人利益同合作社利益、集体利益同国家利益、目前利益同长远利益结合的原则；要贯彻以农业为主结合积极有计划地全面发展农村生产；发展速度既要有积极精神，又要建筑在可靠的基础上；生产投资主要应依靠群众的力量，贯彻增产节约精神，尽量做到投资小、收效大；同时应积极稳步地扩大合作经济阵地，壮大社会主义积累，深入贯彻党在农村三位一体的阶级政策。
      三、加强党的领导是实现农业合作化全面规划的关键
    实现农业合作化全面规划过程中，遇到了许多新的情况和问题。为了使规划的工作切实实行，必须从如下几方面改进和加强党的领导。
    第一、要求领导上必须改变无计划、推着干的工作作风和不重视执行计划，计划订完往兜一揣就算完事的游击习气，树立强烈的计划观念，按计划指导工作。双城县十一区采取按季、按段抓计划的领导方法，根据全面规划的要求，结合每季每段的具体情况，抓住主要关键，订出具体实施计划，然后通过帮助村、社检查计划执行情况研究今后措施，具体将计划布置到村、屯、社、组，组织贯彻实现。结果，既有力地指导了当前以互助合作为中心的生产运动，又通过搞好当前社、组生产保证了长远建设计划的实现。
    第二、实现全面规划要求领导上必须改变一般号召，单纯地催活计、赶进度等一般化的工作作风，切实深入到合作社的生产过程中去，具体指导合作社的经济活动。全面规划之后，合作社都有了丰富的生产建设内容，接着而来的问题是，合作社的经营管理水平远落后于生产发展的需要。如劳动效率不高，生产质量粗糙，窝工浪费现象严重，财务管理混乱，等等。这些都充分反映了，由组转社以后直接管理生产的责任已由个体农民身上转到了合作社的管理机构，农民缺乏管理集体经济的经验，迫切需要党加强具体指导。中共克山县委员会抓住合作社当前经济活动中这个迫切需要解决的问题，深入研究了老社经营管理经验，并把它条理化、制度化，然后加以推广，有效地帮助了广大合作社改进经营管理工作，保证了各社生产计划的实现，推动了以合作化为中心生产规划的实施。这种作法是好的。
    第三、实现全面规划要求领导上对互助合作运动的领导必须改变孤立抓社放弃互助组的偏向，坚持贯彻以社带组的做法。根据各地经验，较好的办法是：在农业合作化规划的基础上，组织互助合作网，建立社、组联系制度，具体帮助解决互助组中的问题，注意吸收其参加合作社的一些有关会议，帮助互助组培养骨干，熟习合作社政策和办社知识等，尤其是应该帮助互助组解决生产上的困难，吸收其联合开荒，兴修水利扩大生产。这是对社外农民一种最实际的教育。
    第四、实现全面规划要求领导上必须改变单打一的工作作风，加强农村全面经济工作的领导。全面规划的实施给农村其他经济工作提出了许多新的要求：推行新式畜力农具、兴修水利、开发水田、发展畜牧，要求有强的技术指导；进行农业基本建设需要把分散在农民手中的余资集中起来；所需用的一些新的生产资料要求供销合作社积极配合。中共双城县委员会适应这个新的情况，注意了加强对其他经济工作的领导。在技术指导方面，加强了对技术推广站的领导，在站内充实和提高了新式农具技术员，增设了水利和畜牧技术员，各区普遍建立了技术传授站，全县共给社训练了二千七百二十六名新式农具技术员，一千零八十五名饲养员和畜牧员。在信用工作方面，除注意了合理贷款外，大力发展了信用合作事业，全县由去年三个社发展到三十三个社，存款余额达二十八万元。在物资供应方面，发展生产所需要的新的或重要的生产资料，都指定了专门的供销社负责，订立合同保证供应。个别领导强的地方还推行了“三角合同”。这些都对支持与推动实现全面规划起了极重要的作用。
    第五、实现全面规划的过程就是社会主义思想同资本主义思想，先进思想同保守思想激烈斗争的过程。因此加强党对农民的思想教育工作，发挥支部的战斗堡垒作用，是实现全面规划的政治动力和保证。双城县吴家村所以能够克服层层困难，终于修建了水利，种上了吴家村有史以来就没有种过的水田，支部的坚强堡垒作用：在困难面前不低头，不断教育鼓励农民建设社会主义的热情，团结和发挥农民群众的智慧与创造性，起了决定性的作用。（新华社）
