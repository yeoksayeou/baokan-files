Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: According to TASS, West German Chancellor Adenauer held a press conference in Moscow on the 14th before departing for home. He described the results of the talks between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and West Germany and explained the West German government's views on some of the issues discussed. More than 100 foreign and Soviet journalists attended the press conference.

Adenauer pointed out that the results of the talks between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and West Germany are reflected in a number of documents. Adenauer briefly described the contents of the letters exchanged between the two sides that have already been published in the newspapers and talked about the reservations he intended to maintain regarding the boundaries and scope of sovereignty of West Germany.

He then said that the West German government delegation had tried from the beginning to avoid holding talks on the reunification of Germany along two lines, namely in Moscow and in Geneva.

Adenauer then emphasized that the Soviet government and the West German government did not agree on any kind of secret agreement or clause during the Moscow talks. He said: During the talks, we were not advised to abolish our treaty obligations to the West regarding participation in the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Adenauer then pointed out that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany would end a state of affairs that has been an important source of instability in Europe. He pointed out that this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. The normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany is a factor in consolidating peace in Europe and the world.

Speaking of the atmosphere of the Moscow talks, Chancellor Adenauer said that, of course, when Germany drew up a debit and credit comparison table of the terrible war against the Soviet Union, it was sometimes unavoidable to become emotional when recalling the past. Sometimes, emotionally charged and intense words were spoken to each other. Adenauer said, but I think it's better to say everything that's in our hearts than to pretend that nothing has happened in the past.

Adenauer recalled earlier concerns that the talks would be in vain, and said: But the result of everything is not like this. We have obtained a result that will strengthen peace in Europe and thus strengthen world peace.

When asked specifically by reporters about the progress of the Moscow talks, Adenauer said that the two delegations disagreed on some issues for several days, but they found that they were finally able to reach an agreement.

    阿登纳在记者招待会上谈同苏联会谈结果
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳在十四日动身回国以前在莫斯科举行记者招待会。他叙述了苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团之间的会谈结果，并且说明了德意志联邦共和国政府对所讨论的一些问题的意见。参加记者招待会的有一百多名外国和苏联记者。
    阿登纳指出，苏联和德意志联邦共和国的政府代表团之间的会谈结果反映在一些文件中。阿登纳在扼要叙述双方交换的已经在报上发表的信件内容时，谈到关于他打算坚持的德意志联邦共和国的疆界和主权范围的保留意见。
    他接着说，德意志联邦共和国政府代表团从一开始就设法避免沿着两条路线，即在莫斯科，又在日内瓦进行关于恢复德国统一问题的会谈。
    阿登纳接着强调说，苏联政府和德意志联邦共和国政府在莫斯科会谈期间并没有商定任何种类的秘密协定或条款。他说：在会谈期间并没有向我们建议废除我们对西方承担的关于参加西欧联盟和北大西洋公约组织的条约义务。
    阿登纳接着指出，建立苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的外交关系将能终止一种一直是欧洲不稳定局势的重要根源的状态。他指出，不能让这种状态照旧存在下去，苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系的正常化，是巩固欧洲和全世界和平的一个因素。
    在谈到莫斯科会谈的气氛时，阿登纳总理说，当然德国对苏联进行的可怕的战争拟订一张借贷对照表时，自然有时不免因想起过去而变得感情激动起来。有时彼此曾互相说过感情用事的激烈的言辞。阿登纳说，但是我认为，把我们心里的话一齐说出来比装作过去没有发生过什么来得好。
    阿登纳追述早先有人担心这次会谈将会是徒劳的，他说：但是，一切事情的结果都不是这样。我们已经获得了一种将能加强欧洲和平从而加强世界和平的结果。
    阿登纳在被记者具体问到莫斯科会谈的进行情况时，他说，两国代表团在一些问题上有好几天意见不能一致，但是他们发现终于能够达成协议。
