    Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Strives to Achieve the General Task of the State During the Transition Period
    Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    I

    It has been almost six years since the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao and participated in the production and construction of the motherland's border areas. Over the past six years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has carried forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army's high patriotism and revolutionary heroism, overcome all difficulties, and made certain contributions to the development of production and the socialist cause in Xinjiang.

    The participation of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in border production can be divided into two periods. The first period was from 1950 to 1952. At that time, Xinjiang had not been peacefully liberated for long, social order had not yet been stabilized, and the national economy, which had been ravaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time, was in urgent need of recovery. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang resolutely carried out the arduous tasks of suppressing bandits and defending the border, and at the same time, threw themselves into the vigorous mass production movement. The material conditions at that time were extremely difficult. The troops responsible for agricultural production and water conservancy construction reclaimed wasteland, built canals, and cultivated land on the deserted Gobi Desert. Most of the troops had no housing and endured the attacks of severe cold and scorching heat. They labored in the open air with simple and backward tools such as soil knives and human-pulled plows. The material conditions of the troops responsible for engineering construction (including industrial capital construction), transportation, and processing of sideline production were equally difficult. Although the situation was so difficult, under the strong leadership of the Party, all the commanders and fighters, with the great ideal of seeking happiness for the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas and building a socialist motherland, completed the production and construction tasks selflessly, and purchased a large number of agricultural machines and industrial equipment by saving on food and clothing, thereby improving the technical equipment for production and accumulating a large amount of funds for national economic construction. The large-scale production movement that developed rapidly during this period played a very important role in the fundamental improvement of Xinjiang's financial and economic situation, and laid a solid foundation for the development of the troops' production and construction in the future.

    The period after 1953 was the second period. During this period, the work of restoring the national economy of our country had been successfully completed, and on this basis, the first five-year plan began to be implemented; Xinjiang's financial and economic situation had also improved substantially, and social order had been stabilized. In order to adapt to the needs of the development of the motherland's economic construction situation, from this time onwards, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang made a clear division of labor. One part was dedicated to national defense tasks, and the other part was dedicated to production and construction. During this period, not only did we concentrate our main forces on developing agricultural production on the original basis and continue to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction in accordance with the tasks stipulated in the first five-year plan, and correspondingly developed the construction industry, transportation industry, and processing of sideline industries, but also greatly improved the quality of all work, actively improved the management system, mastered advanced science and technology, created conditions for the construction of regular state-owned farms, and laid a more solid foundation for the realization of the first five-year plan.

    After nearly six years of hard work, we have achieved great victories on the production front: we have built many modern factories in Xinjiang, which had almost no industrial foundation, and built many new farms on the barren Gobi Desert, which has greatly changed the face of the motherland's border areas.

    II

    The goal of our production and construction troops is to vigorously develop agricultural production, establish regular state-owned farms, promote the socialist transformation of agriculture, and create conditions for national industrial construction. All our work revolves around this goal.

    From 1950 to 1955, the total area we planted with various crops reached 6.23 million mu. From 1950 to 1954, the total output of various crops could be converted to 721.5 million jin of wheat. Due to the continuous improvement of cultivation techniques, the yield per unit area of various crops has also been continuously increasing over the past six years. For example, if the yield per unit area in 1950 is taken as 100, then the yield per unit area of several major crops in 1954 is: wheat 200, rice 174, and cotton 265. The area cultivated by machinery has also been expanding rapidly over the past six years. Machinery was only used in 1951, and the area cultivated by machinery accounted for only 3% of the total cultivated area in 1952, but it has developed to 45% by 1955. Since cotton is of great significance to the development of the national economy, and Xinjiang is one of the most promising cotton-growing areas in the motherland, we have always been concerned about the growth and development of the cotton-growing industry, and have expanded the cotton field area year by year. By 1955, the cotton field area accounted for more than 13% of the total cultivated area. In the future, we must accelerate development on this basis and establish a strong textile raw material supply base in Xinjiang. While developing agriculture, we have also correspondingly developed animal husbandry, producing a large number of wool, hides, dairy products, and meat. We now have 530,000 head of livestock of various sizes and of good quality. In terms of farm infrastructure construction, land planning has been carried out according to the requirements of mechanical cultivation and pasture rotation systems, and farmland irrigation systems, drainage systems, and farmland protection forests have been built. There has also been great progress in farm management. Many military reclamation farms have transitioned from supply-based management to enterprise-based management, implemented economic accounting systems, strengthened planning management, and gained some experience in the integrated management of agriculture and animal husbandry. Due to the continuous development of agricultural production and the achievements made in farm construction, a good foundation has been laid for the establishment of state-owned farms. The construction of regular state-owned farms is no longer a distant prospect but is just around the corner.

    Xinjiang is an arid and rain-scarce area, and most of the cultivated land relies on artificial irrigation. Therefore, the Xinjiang production troops have always attached great importance to water conservancy construction. As early as the spring of 1950, small-scale water conservancy repairs were carried out. In the second half of that year, large-scale water conservancy projects began to be surveyed, designed, and constructed throughout Xinjiang. Since then, large amounts of manpower, materials, and financial resources have been invested in water conservancy construction every year. With the needs of agricultural production development, the scale of water conservancy construction has been expanding year by year, and the number of projects has been increasing year by year. By 1955, sixteen large and medium-sized water conservancy projects were under construction simultaneously, and the basin plans for the Manas River and the Urumqi River were also underway. Up to now, six reservoir projects and nine large-scale canal projects have been completed and partially completed. The total irrigation capacity of these projects reaches more than 3.1 million mu; the amount of earth and stone completed is more than 38.5 million cubic meters. If they are built into dikes with a height and width of one meter each, it would be equal to fifteen times the length of the Great Wall, which can circle the earth once. The great achievements of water conservancy construction over the past six years have provided the most fundamental guarantee for the development of agricultural production and laid the necessary foundation for the realization of the first five-year plan. Water is like the blood of the land. It has restored life to the barren land that has been rarely visited for centuries and turned it into an oasis!

    In order to develop the economy of various departments of the farm, we have also correspondingly developed processing sideline industries including processing of agricultural and livestock products, repair of agricultural machinery and automobiles, and production of building materials. We have established many large and small factories and handicraft workshops, which have played a great role in coordinating the development of basic production departments (agriculture) of the farm and meeting the needs of production materials and living materials of the farm.

    From 1950 to 1954, the construction engineering troops completed the construction projects of seventeen industrial enterprises including petroleum, metal, steel, cement, machinery, automobile repair, and textile, as well as nearly 200,000 square meters of non-productive construction projects. The troops and farms also built 900,000 square meters of housing. Through six years of engineering construction, a strong construction engineering force has been trained, which is of great significance to Xinjiang's economic construction in the future.

    In terms of transportation, the automobile transportation troops have completed a total of 729 million ton-kilometers of transportation tasks in the past six years. This strong transportation force plays a very important role in the connection between Xinjiang and the interior, and has become the main force in Xinjiang's transportation industry.

    Through the practical training of production and construction and the training of regular agricultural schools, we have trained a large number of leading cadres and technical personnel with considerable political and professional qualities, many of whom have been tested by long-term revolutionary wars. They are truly worthy of the title "heroes in battle, good men in production." These cadres and technical personnel are extremely valuable assets for building a socialist motherland.

    The above is the main achievement of the Xinjiang production force.

    The history and achievements of production and construction over the past six years prove that the Xinjiang production force is a loyal team of the Party and Chairman Mao, and a shock force for socialist construction. The great achievements it has made have not only played a very important role in the restoration and development of Xinjiang's national economy, but also directly increased socialist economic factors and weakened the capitalist camp; it not only has great economic significance, but also has great political significance.

    However, the above is only one aspect of the achievement. The other aspect of the achievements of the Xinjiang production force is that it has promoted the socialist transformation of agriculture in Xinjiang through its influence and assistance to farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Farmers of all ethnic groups have personally seen the benefits of collective labor and large-scale mechanized production, and realized that only by taking the bright road of socialism can they have a truly happy life. They have been vividly educated by the fact that the troops have adopted a series of advanced cultivation techniques to obtain large-scale and high-yield grain and cotton crops, and have improved their cultivation techniques under the influence of the troops. The Xinjiang production troops have always regarded helping farmers of all ethnic groups develop production as their important task. Over the past six years, they have not only provided technical and material assistance to farmers of all ethnic groups, but also solved the problem of water use for more than 1 million mu of farmland in water conservancy construction.

    In October 1954, the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Military Region jointly issued the "Decision on Strengthening the Assistance of Agricultural Production and Construction Troops Stationed in Xinjiang to Farmers of All Ethnic Groups to Carry Out Agricultural Production Increase Movement Centered on Mutual Assistance and Cooperation." Since then, the assistance of the production troops to farmers of all ethnic groups has entered a new stage. The Xinjiang production troops faithfully implemented this decision, and in the winter of 1954 and the spring of 1955, they successively transferred a large number of cadres to help local areas establish agricultural technology guidance stations and agricultural production cooperatives, guide the agricultural production of farmers organized near the reclamation area, and help agricultural cooperatives improve their management systems. The production troops also imparted agricultural scientific knowledge to farmers through agricultural exhibitions, cultivation technique performances, and by absorbing the backbone of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups to participate in agricultural training courses and production technology conferences, which greatly promoted the improvement and enhancement of the cultivation techniques of farmers of all ethnic groups.

    Through the above series of assistance and influences, not only has the production enthusiasm and mutual assistance and cooperation of farmers of all ethnic groups been improved, and the development of agricultural production has been promoted, but also the people of all ethnic groups have more deeply realized that the People's Liberation Army is an army that seeks happiness for the people, thereby strengthening the flesh-and-blood relationship between the People's Liberation Army and the people of all ethnic groups.

    III

    We have been able to achieve the above achievements, first of all because of the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and at the same time, because of the active support of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, and the heroic struggle of all commanders and fighters. Because of this, we have written a glorious and brilliant page in the history of border construction.

    In the future, the tasks of the Xinjiang production troops, as instructed by the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Military Region, in addition to working hard to improve the agricultural and animal husbandry production of the troops, striving to realize regular state-owned farms as soon as possible, further developing the agricultural and animal husbandry production of the troops, and actively creating and preparing favorable conditions for large-scale industrial construction after the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, should also undertake the glorious task of vigorously assisting farmers of all ethnic groups and carrying out agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation. This is the dual task that we must accomplish in the future. Although there are many difficulties ahead of us, under the correct leadership of the Party and with the active support of the people of all ethnic groups, we have full confidence in completing this glorious task.

    Now the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is about to be established. This is a great happy event in the political life of the people of all ethnic groups in the country and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and it is a brilliant achievement of the Party's ethnic policy. All commanders and fighters of our Xinjiang production troops extend warm congratulations to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In the future, we will unite more closely with the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang around the Party and Chairman Mao, and strive to build the border areas of the motherland and realize the general task of the country during the transition period!

    新疆生产建设部队为实现国家过渡时期总任务而奋斗
    中国人民解放军新疆军区副司令员　陶峙岳
    一
    中国人民解放军新疆军区部队自响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召参加祖国边疆生产建设以来，已经快达六年了。六年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，新疆生产建设部队发扬了人民解放军高度爱国主义和革命英雄主义的光荣传统，战胜了一切困难，为新疆生产的发展和社会主义事业作出了一定的贡献。
    新疆生产建设部队参加边疆生产，可以分作两个时期。从一九五○年到一九五二年是第一个时期。这时，新疆和平解放不久，社会秩序尚未安定，遭到国民党反动派长期摧残的国民经济亟待恢复。所以，驻新疆人民解放军一方面坚决执行了剿匪和守卫边防的艰巨任务，另一方面又投入了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动中。当时的物质条件是极其困难的，担任农业生产和水利建设的部队在渺无人烟的戈壁滩上开荒、修渠、种地，绝大部分部队没有房住，忍受着严寒和酷暑的袭击，用砍土镘和人拉犁等简陋落后的工具，餐风宿露地劳动着。担任工程建筑（包括工业基本建设）、运输和加工副业生产的部队的物质条件也是同等艰苦的。虽然情况如此困难，但全体指战员在党的坚强领导下，抱着为边疆各族人民谋幸福和建设社会主义祖国的伟大理想，奋不顾身地完成了生产建设任务，并且节衣缩食购买了大批农业机器和工业设备，从而改善了生产技术装备，为国家经济建设积累了大量的资金。这一时期迅速发展起来的规模巨大的生产运动，对新疆财政经济状况的基本好转起了很重要的作用，并为以后部队生产建设事业的发展打下了强大的基础。
    一九五三年以后是第二个时期。这一时期，我国国民经济的恢复工作已胜利完成，并且在这个基础上开始实行第一个五年计划；新疆的财政经济状况也已基本好转，社会秩序已经安定。为了适应祖国经济建设形势发展的需要，从这时起驻新疆人民解放军作了明确的分工，一部分专门担任国防任务，另一部分则专门担任生产建设。在这一时期内，不但根据第一个五年计划所规定的任务在原有基础上集中主要力量发展了农业生产和继续进行了大规模的水利建设，相应地发展了建筑业、运输业和加工副业，并且大大提高了各项工作质量，积极改进了经营管理制度，掌握了先进的科学技术，为建设正规化的国营农场创造了条件，为第一个五年计划的实现奠定了更加稳固的基础。
    经过将近六年的艰苦奋斗，我们在生产战线上取得了伟大的胜利：在几乎毫无工业基础的新疆建设了许多现代化工厂，在荒凉的戈壁滩上建设了许多新农场，使祖国边疆的面貌起了很大的变化。
    二
    我们生产建设部队的奋斗目标是要大力发展农业生产，建立正规化国营农场，促进农业的社会主义改造，为国家工业建设创造条件。我们一切工作都是围绕这个目标进行的。
    从一九五○年到一九五五年，我们种植各种作物的面积累计达六百二十三万亩，从一九五○年到一九五四年各种作物总产量累计可折合小麦七亿二千一百五十万市斤。由于耕作技术的不断改进，六年来各种作物的单位面积产量也不断提高，如以一九五○年的单位面积产量为一百，则一九五四年几种主要作物的单位面积产量是：小麦二百，水稻一百七十四，棉花二百六十五。六年来机耕面积也在迅速扩大着，一九五一年才开始使用机器，一九五二年机耕面积仅占全部种植面积的百分之三，到一九五五年就已发展到了百分之四十五。由于棉花对国民经济的发展具有重大的意义，新疆又是祖国最有前途的植棉区之一，所以我们一直关心植棉业的成长和发展，逐年扩大了棉田面积，到一九五五年棉田面积已占全部种植面积的百分之十三强。今后我们要在这个基础上加速发展，在新疆建立一个强大的纺织原料供应基地。在发展农业的同时，我们也相应地发展了畜牧业，生产了大批羊毛、畜皮、乳品和肉类，我们现在已有了质量较好的大小牲畜五十三万头。在农场基本建设方面，根据机械耕作和牧草轮栽制的要求，进行了土地规划，建造了农田灌溉系统、排水系统和农田防护林。在农场经营管理方面也有很大的进步，很多军垦农场已由供给制经营过渡到企业化经营，实行了经济核算制，加强了计划管理，并在农牧结合经营方面取得了一定的经验。由于农业生产的不断发展和在农场建设上取得的成就，已为建立国营农场打下了良好的基础，现在建成正规化的国营农场已不复是遥遥无期而是指日可望的了。
    新疆是一个干旱少雨的地区，绝大部分耕地都依靠人工灌溉。所以新疆生产部队对于水利建设一直是极其重视的。远在一九五○年春季就进行了小型水利整修工作，这年下半年就开始在全疆各地进行大型水利工程的勘测设计和修建。从此以后，每年都以大批的人力、物力和财力投入水利建设中。随着农业生产发展的需要，水利建设的规模一年比一年扩大，工程项目也一年比一年增多，到一九五五年有十六项大、中型水利工程同时施工，玛纳斯河和乌鲁木齐河的流域规划也在进行。截至目前为止，已经完成和部分完成了六项水库工程和九项大型渠道工程，这些工程的总灌溉能力达三百一十多万亩；完成的土石方达三千八百五十多万立方公尺，如果砌成高宽各一公尺的堤坝，则等于万里长城的十五倍长，可绕地球一周。六年来水利建设的巨大成就为农业生产的发展提供了最根本的保证，为第一个五年计划的实现奠定了必要的基础。水，有如土地的血液，它使多少世纪以来人迹罕到的荒地重新恢复了生命，变成了绿洲！
    为了发展农场各部门经济，我们还相应地发展了包括农牧产品加工、农机汽车修理和建筑材料生产等部门的加工副业，建立了许多大、小型工厂和手工业工场，在配合农场基本生产部门（农业）的发展和满足农场生产资料、生活资料的需要方面起了很大的作用。
    从一九五○年到一九五四年，建筑工程部队完成了包括石油、金属、钢铁、水泥、机器、汽车修配、纺织等十七个工业企业的建筑工程和将近二十万平方公尺的非生产性建筑工程，部队农场还修建了九十万平方公尺的住房。通过六年来的工程建筑已锻炼出一支强大的建筑工程部队，这对于今后新疆的经济建设有十分重大的意义。
    在运输业方面，汽车运输部队六年来共完成了七亿二千九百余万吨公里的运输任务。这支强大的运输部队对于新疆和关内的联系起着很重要的作用，成为新疆运输事业中的主力军。
    经过生产建设的实际锻炼和正规农业学校的训练，我们培养了大批具有相当政治素养和业务素养的领导干部和技术人员，其中有很多人是经过长期革命战争的考验的，真不愧“战斗是英雄，生产是好汉”。这批干部和技术人员是建设社会主义祖国的极可珍贵的财产。
    以上就是新疆生产部队的主要成就。
    六年来生产建设的历史和成就证明：新疆生产部队是党和毛主席的忠实队伍，是社会主义建设的突击力量，它所取得的伟大成就不仅对新疆国民经济的恢复和发展起了十分重要的作用，而且直接增加了社会主义经济因素，削弱了资本主义阵地；不仅有巨大的经济意义，而且有巨大的政治意义。
    然而，以上所述，只是成就的一方面。新疆生产部队所获得的成就的另一方面，是通过它对新疆各族农民的影响和帮助，促进了新疆农业的社会主义改造。各族农民亲眼见到了集体劳动和机械化大生产的好处，认识到只有走社会主义这条光明大道才会有真正幸福的生活。他们从部队采用一系列的先进耕作技术而获得粮棉作物大面积丰产的事实中受到了生动的教育，在部队的影响下改进了耕作技术。新疆生产部队一直把帮助各族农民发展生产看成自己的重大任务，六年来不但对各族农民进行了技术上和物质上的援助，而且在水利建设中解决了一百万亩以上民田的用水问题。
    一九五四年十月，中共中央新疆分局和新疆军区党委会联合发布了“关于驻新疆农业生产建设部队加强援助各族农民开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动的决定”，从此，生产部队对各族农民的援助便进入了一个新阶段。新疆生产部队忠实地执行了这个决定，在一九五四年冬和一九五五年春先后抽调了大批干部帮助地方建立农业技术指导站和农业生产合作社，指导垦区附近组织起来的农民的农业生产，帮助农业社改进经营管理制度。生产部队还通过农业展览会、耕作技术表演和在举办农业训练班以及召开生产技术会议时吸收农业社和互助组的骨干参加等方式，向农民传授了农业科学知识，对各族农民耕作技术的改进和提高起了很大的促进作用。
    通过上述一系列的帮助和影响，不但提高了各族农民的生产热情和互助合作的积极性，推动了农业生产的发展，而且使各族人民更加亲切地体会到人民解放军是为人民谋幸福的军队，从而加强了人民解放军和各族人民之间血肉相联的关系。
    三
    我们能够取得上述成就，首先是因为有党和毛主席的正确领导，同时，也是因为有新疆各族人民的积极支援，苏联专家的无私帮助，和全体指战员的英勇奋斗。正因为这样，才使我们在边疆建设史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。
    今后新疆生产部队的任务，正如中共中央新疆分局和新疆军区党委会所指示的一样，除了努力搞好部队农牧业生产，争取尽早实现正规化的国营农场，更大地发展部队农牧业生产，积极为兰新铁路修通后进行大规模的工业建设创造和准备有利条件外，还应担负起大力援助各族农民，开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动的光荣任务。这就是我们今后所必须完成的双重任务。尽管在我们前面还有重重困难，但是在党的正确领导下，在各族人民的积极支援下，我们有充分的信心完成这项光荣任务。
    现在新疆维吾尔自治区即将成立了。这是全国各族人民和新疆各族人民政治生活中的一件大喜事，是党的民族政策的光辉成就，我们新疆生产部队全体指战员谨向新疆各族人民致以热烈的祝贺。我们今后将和新疆各族人民更加紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，为建设祖国边疆、为实现国家在过渡时期的总任务而奋斗！
