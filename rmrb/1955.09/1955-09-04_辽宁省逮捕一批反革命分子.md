    (Reported by this newspaper) The People's Public Security organs of ten cities in Liaoning Province, with the active assistance of the masses, after a long period of thorough investigation, arrested a batch of counter-revolutionaries on August 31 in accordance with the law. Among these criminals, there were American-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, heinous remaining counter-revolutionaries who had escaped the net, counter-revolutionaries who had committed crimes in the past and continued to engage in sabotage activities after being leniently treated by the government, staunch counter-revolutionaries from the hostile classes who resisted and undermined socialist transformation, and hidden counter-revolutionaries who infiltrated organs, factories, and enterprises using double-dealing tactics.
    These counter-revolutionaries extremely hated the victory of the people and tried every possible means to undermine the cause of socialist construction. They used all kinds of despicable means, especially utilizing technology or wearing various legal disguises, to carry out frantic sabotage of industrial and agricultural production and basic construction. For example, the counter-revolutionary Fan Kai, who was a puppet Manchurian policeman and secretary of the puppet maintenance association, sneaked into the Anshan Exploration Company of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry after liberation and used the "engineer" position he had fraudulently obtained to carry out technical sabotage. During the exploration of Gongchangling, someone discovered that the direction of the two profile lines was incorrect and that the two trenches being dug would meet. After reporting to Fan Kai, he knew it was wrong but deliberately said: "It doesn't matter if it's wrong, just do it!" As a result, the two trenches really met, the work was completely scrapped, and the task could not be completed on schedule, causing the state to lose more than 4,700 yuan. He also deliberately told the workers to dig blindly in places where it was completely unnecessary without designing, surveying, or asking for instructions, wasting manpower and state funds of more than 1,900 yuan. Fan Kai also disobeyed the suggestions of Soviet experts in a perfunctory manner and arbitrarily designed drilling holes, wasting state funds of more than 18,000 yuan. As another example, the reactionary rich peasant Zhu Lianjun infiltrated the Hongxing Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Eighth District of Andong City, stole the position of accountant, embezzled public funds, deliberately messed up the cooperative's accounts, and used women to win over the director of the cooperative, painstakingly trying to provoke the relationship between the director and deputy director in an attempt to bring down the cooperative. After his conspiracy was exposed and he was expelled from the cooperative, he stole the cooperative's green seedlings to sabotage production. This group of counter-revolutionaries was extremely vicious and cunning. They concealed their crimes, changed their names, fabricated false histories, and infiltrated our organs, enterprises, schools, etc., using double-dealing tactics to carry out sabotage in secret. For example, Mao Fengji, who served as a physical education teacher at Liaoyang No. 1 Junior High School, was originally a member of the San Qing Tuan, a secret agent of the "Fuxing Society," and a cousin of Mao Renfeng, the head of the Kuomintang secret service. He was in close contact with the head of the Kuomintang secret service and participated in high-level secret service meetings. During his time as a major supervisor in Chiang Kai-shek's army with the identity of a secret agent, he actively participated in plotting to murder two of our staff members. After Mao Fengji fabricated a history and sneaked into the school, he pretended to be honest on the surface, but secretly attacked progressive teachers, spread reactionary remarks, and undermined unity. What was particularly insidious was that in physical education teaching, when teaching students to practice throwing grenades and climbing parallel bars, he deliberately gave incorrect guidance, causing students to suffer dislocations and fractures. Five students have already been severely damaged and injured.
    This batch of counter-revolutionaries were all inhuman bandits. They not only sabotaged economic construction, but also murdered innocent people and directly endangered the safety of people's lives and property. For example, the counter-revolutionary Tong Xingrong, who was under control, obtained the lifting of his control after deceiving the authorities, fled from Shandong to Shenyang, and colluded with habitual thieves and bandits five times, stealing a total of forty-three sections of railway signal lines and detonating fuse lines. Fortunately, they were discovered in time, otherwise, it would have caused a serious train crash. The counter-revolutionary Jing Guangming, because his counter-revolutionary uncle Jiang Zhan'ao carried out technical sabotage and was arrested and sentenced, was extremely hostile to the People's Government and deliberately planned to retaliate. Taking advantage of the fact that Zhao Weicai, a labor model and advanced group leader of the Liaoning Provincial Second Construction Company, was unprepared, he struck Zhao Weicai's head with a hammer, causing Zhao Weicai to immediately die with his brains splattered.
    Among this group of criminals, there were also remaining counter-revolutionaries who were heavily in debt with blood, and had committed heinous crimes. They were all criminals who escaped during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement in 1951. Although they had exhausted their efforts to hide everywhere, changed their names, fabricated documents, and attempted to hide for a long time in the past few years, they were finally recognized by the people and did not escape the people's law.
    This time, there were also stubborn and persistent counter-revolutionaries who insisted on reactionary positions, resisted and undermined socialist transformation, and staunch counter-revolutionaries from hostile classes, as well as counter-revolutionaries who still harbored evil intentions after being leniently treated by the government and were incorrigible.
    The public security organs of various cities also arrested a number of habitual thieves, bandits, and hooligan ringleaders who organized bandit gangs.
    In the process of searching for counter-revolutionaries and various criminals, the public security organs in various places have received the active support and enthusiastic assistance of the broad masses.

    辽宁省逮捕一批反革命分子
    本报讯　辽宁省十个市的人民公安机关，在群众积极协助下，经过长时间的周密调查，在八月三十一日依法逮捕了一批反革命分子。这批罪犯中，有美蒋特务分子，有罪大恶极的残余漏网反革命分子，有在历史上有罪恶、经政府宽大处理后仍进行破坏活动的怙恶不悛的反革命分子，有抗拒和破坏社会主义改造的敌对阶级中的坚决反革命分子，有以两面手法混进机关、工厂、企业内部的暗藏反革命分子等。
    这些反革命分子极端仇恨人民的胜利，千方百计地破坏社会主义建设事业。他们以种种卑鄙手段，特别是利用技术或披着各种合法的外衣，对工农业生产和基本建设进行了疯狂的破坏。如反革命分子樊开，是伪满警察又是伪维持会秘书，解放后钻入重工业部地质局鞍山勘探公司，利用骗取到的“工程师”职权进行技术破坏。在弓长岭勘探时，有人发现两个剖面线开测的方向不对，挖的两个槽子要碰头，报告樊开后，他明知不对却有意地说：“错点没关系，就这样干吧！”结果两个槽子当真碰了头，工作全部报废，任务不能按期完成，使国家损失了四千七百多元。他又不设计、不测量、不请示报告，故意叫工人在完全没有必要的地方去瞎挖一通，浪费人力和国家资金一千九百多元。樊开还阳奉阴违地对待苏联专家建议，随意设计钻孔，浪费国家资金一万八千多元。再如，反动富农分子朱连俊混入安东市第八区红星第二农业生产合作社以后，窃取了会计职务，盗用公款，故意搞乱社内账目，并利用女人拉拢社主任，处心积虑挑拨正副主任之间的关系，企图搞垮合作社。他的阴谋被揭发而被开除出社以后，又偷割合作社的青苗，破坏生产。这批反革命分子十分恶毒和狡诈。他们隐瞒罪恶，改名换姓，编造假历史，混入我们机关、企业、学校等，以两面派手法，暗地进行破坏。如在辽阳第一初级中学充任体育教员的毛凤集，原来是个三青团员、“复兴社”特务，匪特务头子毛人凤的堂弟。他同国民党特务头子联系密切，参加过高级特务会议。在他以特务身份担任蒋贼军少校督导员等职期间，曾积极参与谋害我两名工作人员。毛凤集伪造历史钻入学校以后，表面假装老实，暗中打击进步教师，散布反动言论，破坏团结。特别阴险的是，他在体育教学中，教学生练习掷手榴弹、攀杠子等时，故意作不正确的指导，使学生发生骨节脱臼和骨折等事故，已有五名学生受到严重摧残与伤害。
    这一批反革命分子都是一些毫无人性的匪徒。他们不但破坏经济建设，而且凶杀暗害无辜人民，直接危害人民生命财产的安全。如被管制的反革命分子童兴荣，骗得解除管制后，由山东逃来沈阳，曾前后五次勾结惯窃惯盗，盗窃铁路号志线、导结线共达四十三节，幸亏及时发现，不然，将会造成严重的撞车事故。反革命分子靖广明，因他的反革命的舅父姜占鳌进行技术破坏，被逮捕判刑，对人民政府极端仇视，蓄意进行报复。他乘辽宁省第二建筑公司劳动模范、先进小组长赵维财没有防备，手持铁锤猛击赵维财的头部，致赵维财立即脑浆迸裂而死。
    这一批罪犯中还有血债累累、罪大恶极的残余漏网反革命分子。他们都是在一九五一年镇压反革命运动时漏网逃脱的罪犯，几年来虽用尽心机到处躲藏，改名换姓，假造证件，企图长期隐匿，伺机进行破坏，但到底被人民识破，没有逃出人民的法网。
    这一次逮捕的还有执迷不悟、坚持反动立场、抗拒和破坏社会主义改造的敌对阶级中的坚决反革命分子，以及经过政府宽大处理仍然祸心不死、怙恶不悛的反革命分子。
    各市公安机关还逮捕了一批组织盗匪集团的惯盗、土匪和流氓首恶分子。
    各地公安机关在搜捕反革命分子和各种犯罪分子的时候，得到了广大群众的积极支持和热情协助。
