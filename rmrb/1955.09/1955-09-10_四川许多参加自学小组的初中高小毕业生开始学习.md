Many junior and senior primary school graduates in Sichuan Province who are participating in self-study groups have begun their enjoyable learning life.

According to incomplete statistics from five cities and counties including Chengdu, Yibin, and Neijiang, more than 7,000 junior and senior primary school graduates who did not continue their schooling this year have joined self-study groups. Many cities and counties, such as Chongqing and Chengdu, have established self-study guidance committees. Neijiang and other cities have also specially trained a group of instructors for the self-study groups to help these graduates with their studies.

Various organizations have been established in various places to assist these graduates in their studies. The self-study radio lectures for senior primary school graduates, jointly organized by Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality, are scheduled to begin in mid-September. The Sichuan Provincial Department of Education has compiled and printed a set of self-study radio lecture textbooks to help graduates review their senior primary school lessons and learn some junior high school courses. Chengdu, Chongqing, Wanxian and other cities will also respectively open self-study lectures, cultural supplementary lectures, and natural science lectures for junior high school graduates. The four self-study lectures planned to be held in Chengdu will systematically teach junior high school graduates basic production knowledge in industry and agriculture. Wutongqiao City and other places have also established mobile libraries and youth reading rooms. Chengdu, Wanxian and other cities will also help students participating in self-study groups organize scientific research, aviation model, literature and art, embroidery and other groups.
