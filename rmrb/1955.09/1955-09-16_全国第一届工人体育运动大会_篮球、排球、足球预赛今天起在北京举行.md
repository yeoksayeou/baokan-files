The basketball, volleyball, and football preliminaries for the National First Workers' Games will begin on the 16th at the Beijing Municipal Workers' Cultural Palace, Beihai, East Chang'an Street, Xian Nong Tan, Guan Yuan and other stadiums.

The athletes from seventeen industrial units participating in this sports meet have arrived in Beijing one after another to register for the games.

Among these athletes is Wang Chonglun, a representative of the National People's Congress and a nationally renowned model worker, who will participate in the 200-meter low hurdles competition. There are also many responsible cadres from Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, such as Zhang Qingwu, the director of the Fushun Heating Plant, who regularly leads the factory's employees in physical exercise. This time, he was selected as the captain of the coal mine system's football team.

Many of the athletes are activists in socialist construction. Some come from various basic construction sites, some from Hainan Island and the Yellow River harnessing site, some from the Huai River harnessing site and the Kangzang Highway, and some from Xinjiang and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the frontier of the motherland. Among them are tractor drivers from the State-run Friendship Farm, veteran workers, mothers of many children, and athletes from fraternal ethnic groups in remote areas such as Mongolian, Russian, Korean, Hui, and Minzu.

These athletes were selected from the grassroots level within each industrial unit. They generally possess a high level of skill. In the selection competitions, some athletes broke national records, and some athletes' results approached national records. For example, Shen Bingqing, a female cyclist from the railway system, broke the national record in the 5,000-meter event, and the performance of the male hand grenade thrower from the heavy industry system approached the national record.

    全国第一届工人体育运动大会
    篮球、排球、足球预赛今天起在北京举行
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会篮球、排球、足球预赛从十六日开始分别在北京市劳动人民文化宫、北海、东长安街、先农坛、官园等体育场举行。
    参加这次体育运动大会的十七个产业单位的运动员，已经陆续到达北京向大会报到。
    这些运动员中，有全国人民代表大会代表、全国著名的劳动模范王崇伦，他将参加大会的二百公尺低栏竞赛；还有许多党、行政、工会和青年团的负责干部，如抚顺暖气厂厂长张庆武，经常带动本厂职工进行体育锻炼，这次，他被选为煤矿系统的足球代表队队长。
    运动员中很多是建设社会主义的积极分子。他们有的来自各基本建设工地，有的来自海南岛和根治黄河的工地，有的来自治淮工地和康藏公路，还有的来自祖国边疆的新疆和内蒙古自治区。他们中间有国营友谊农场的拖拉机手，有老工人，有很多孩子的妈妈；还有来自边远的蒙族、俄罗斯族、朝鲜族、回族、民家族等兄弟民族的运动员。
    这些运动员都是各产业单位自下而上选拔出来的。他们一般都具有较高的水平，在选拔比赛中，有的运动员的成绩已突破全国纪录，有些运动员的成绩接近了全国纪录。如铁路系统女运动员沈冰清的自行车五千公尺突破了全国最高纪录，重工业系统的男子手榴弹掷远运动员的成绩接近了全国最高纪录。
