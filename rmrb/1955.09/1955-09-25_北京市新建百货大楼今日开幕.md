The new Beijing Department Store – the Wangfujing Department Store of the Beijing Branch of the China National Department Store Corporation – is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM today (the 25th) and officially begin operations.

    This department store is currently the largest in Beijing. After fifteen months of construction, it was fully completed on September 1st. The building has a construction area of over 19,700 square meters and a business area of over 10,600 square meters. The building can accommodate more than 10,000 customers at the same time. The building has six floors, with the bottom three floors being business premises and the top three floors being warehouses, offices, and welfare facilities for the store's employees. The building has relatively complete ventilation and warm air equipment, which can constantly bring in large amounts of fresh air and keep the temperature inside the building from exceeding 34 degrees Celsius in summer and not lower than 15 degrees Celsius in winter. There are spacious lounges on the second and third floors, as well as three fitting rooms. To reduce the fatigue of mothers with children while shopping, a mother-child lounge is also provided on the second floor. This department store also has its own clothing processing factory, with clothing designers responsible for designing fashionable clothing for customers.

    This department store is divided into eighteen commodity departments according to the nature of the goods. In the initial stage of operation, it sells more than 13,800 kinds of goods, which is twice the total number of goods sold by the first and fourth sales departments of the Beijing Department Store Company in the past. The designs of the goods are also more novel than in the past. The variety of clothing, knitwear, and special handicrafts has increased significantly compared to the past. The children's clothing department alone has more than 200 more types of children's clothing than in the past, and the number of children's toys has doubled. The business area of the children's goods department is equal to the entire business area of the second shopping mall of the first sales department of the Beijing Department Store Company.

    After the department store starts operating, the variety of goods will gradually increase to 20,000. (Attached pictures)
