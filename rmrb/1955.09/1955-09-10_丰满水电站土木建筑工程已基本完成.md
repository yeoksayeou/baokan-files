Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 9th. The civil construction work in the restoration and reconstruction of China's largest hydroelectric power station – the Fengman Hydropower Station – has been basically completed. After several years of reconstruction, the originally riddled and uneven dam has been completely reinforced and heightened. The water level in Songhua Lake has also reached the normal level specified in the design. Now, when the newly installed gates are opened, waterfall-like torrents rush straight down the sloping, smooth spillway. The latest Soviet-style hydro-generators installed during the reconstruction use the abundant water stored in Songhua Lake to generate powerful electricity. This powerful electricity is transmitted continuously to many industrial cities and mining areas in Northeast China through several ultra-high-voltage transmission lines connected by thousands of iron towers.

The Fengman Hydropower Station began construction in 1937 during the Japanese imperialist occupation of Northeast China. The original design planned to install eight hydro-generators, calling it the "second largest" giant hydroelectric power station in the Far East. By the time power generation began in 1943, the dam project had not yet been completed, and the quality was poor, with serious leaks, creating a very dangerous situation. During the period of Chiang Kai-shek's occupation, it suffered serious damage. Therefore, when it was liberated in March 1948, the hydropower station was completely paralyzed. After taking over the Fengman Hydropower Station, the People's Government quickly restored its power generation. With the help of Soviet experts, they immediately began the restoration and reconstruction of the dam, and the Soviet Union helped redesign the Fengman Hydropower Station. According to the design, large-scale drilling and grouting were carried out and a large amount of concrete was poured, successfully solving the problems of dam leakage and stability, transforming the originally jagged dam into a solid whole, increasing its strength, intercepting the extraordinarily large flood of 1953, and ensuring the safety of millions of people downstream. At the same time, the original dam spillway, downstream revetment, and energy dissipation facilities that had been destroyed by floods were rebuilt, and the installation of the dam spillway gates was completed in a concentrated effort. This series of works fundamentally changed the dilapidated appearance of the Fengman Hydropower Station dam.

With the progress of the dam restoration and reconstruction project, the Fengman Hydropower Station has also successively installed the latest Soviet-designed, automated giant hydro-generators and a complete set of substation and power distribution auxiliary equipment. In the central part of Northeast China, an ultra-high-voltage transmission line several hundred kilometers long and two substations were also added in coordination.

The entire reconstruction project of the Fengman Hydropower Station is planned to be completed in 1959. At that time, its power generation capacity will exceed twice the highest power generation capacity during the Japanese imperialist occupation in 1945, reaching 567,000 kilowatts. After the completion of the Fengman Hydropower Station, it will also appropriately regulate the water volume through the control of the dam gates, realizing the comprehensive utilization of the river. In this way, it will not only facilitate the navigation, irrigation, and log rafting of the Songhua River, but also ensure that the area of several hundred kilometers along both banks of the Songhua River from Fengman to Harbin is free from floods.

    丰满水电站土木建筑工程已基本完成
    新华社长春九日电　中国目前最大的水力发电站——丰满水电站的恢复改建工作中的土木建筑工程已经基本完成。经过几年来的改建，这个水电站原来千疮百孔、高低不平的堤坝，已经全部加固加高完毕。松花湖内的水位也达到了设计上所规定的正常水位。现在，打开新安装的闸门，瀑布般的急流就沿着倾斜的、光滑的溢流面直奔而下。在改建中安装起来的苏联最新式的水轮发电机，就利用存蓄在松花湖的充沛的水量，发出强大的电力。这些强大的电力通过由几千个铁塔连接起来的若干条超高压输电线，源源不绝地输送到东北许多工业城市和工矿区。
    丰满水电站在一九三七年日本帝国主义占领我国东北期间开始建设。原设计准备安装八台水轮发电机，称为“远东第二个”巨型水电站。到一九四三年开始发电时，这个水电站堤坝工程尚未完工，并且质量低劣，漏水严重，形势非常危险。在蒋匪占领期间，又遭受了严重破坏。因此，到一九四八年三月解放时，这个水电站已经全部陷入瘫痪状态。人民政府在接收丰满水电站以后，很快使它恢复了发电。在苏联专家的帮助下，随即着手进行堤坝的恢复改建工作，并由苏联帮助对丰满水电站重新进行了设计。根据设计，进行了大规模的钻孔灌浆和浇制了大量的混凝土，胜利地解决了堤坝漏水和稳定性的问题，使这个原来狼牙锯齿般的堤坝，改建成为坚固的整体，增加了强度，拦蓄了一九五三年的特大洪水，保障了下游几百万人民的安全。同时，还改建了原来被洪水冲毁的堤坝溢流面、下游护堤和消力设施，突击完成了堤坝溢流闸门的安装工作。这一系列工作根本地改变了丰满水电站堤坝的残破面貌。
    随着堤坝恢复改建工程的进展，丰满水电站还先后安装了苏联最新设计的、自动化的巨型水轮发电机和全套的变电、配电附属设备。在东北地区中部还配合增建了一条长达几百公里的超高压输电线路和两个变电所。
    丰满水电站的全部改建工程计划在一九五九年完成。那时，它的发电能力将超过一九四五年日本帝国主义占领时期最高发电能力的一倍，达到五十六万七千瓩。丰满水电站建成以后，并将通过水电站堤坝闸门的控制，适当调节水量，实现河流的综合利用。这样，不但便利于松花江的航运、灌溉、流筏，并能保证从丰满到哈尔滨的松花江两岸几百公里地区免于水患。
