    Carefully Safeguard Discharged Serviceman Certificates and Military Family Certificates

    (I) To the Editor:
    Recently, incidents of discharged servicemen's certificates being swindled, stolen, and lost have occurred continuously in our county. Sun Taige, a discharged serviceman from the Fifth District, had his discharged serviceman certificate and more than eighty yuan stolen by a pickpocket while shopping at the market, less than half a month after returning home. Shen Qingyun, a discharged construction serviceman from Chengguan Town, took off his jacket and left it in the room while attending a flood control work conference in the county. As a result, the jacket, along with the discharged serviceman certificate in the pocket, was stolen. Wu Ti, a discharged construction serviceman from Jiepai Town, Sixth District, lost his discharge certificate on his way back home. This situation has also occurred in other counties.
    Counter-revolutionary elements, in order to forge history and infiltrate revolutionary organs to carry out sabotage activities, will try every means to steal or forge various certificates of revolutionary organs. Therefore, all discharged servicemen should raise their revolutionary vigilance and safeguard their certificates.

    (II) To the Editor:
    Recently, we discovered an incident in Zongyang County, Anhui, where a bad element stole a revolutionary military family certificate to impersonate a military family member and disrupt social order. The course of this incident is as follows: Liu Yong, a political instructor of a certain battalion of the Ningdu Military Sub-district of the Jiangxi Military Region (a native of Tanggou Town, Zongyang County), sent his revolutionary military certificate to his adoptive father, Liu Nanxiang, in the second half of 1954. Because Liu Nanxiang was not Liu Yong's direct relative, and because he had no financial difficulties and did not need government assistance, he casually discarded the military family certificate, which was then stolen by habitual thief Liu Duncai. After stealing the military family certificate, Liu committed theft everywhere. On November 6, 1954, Liu Duncai took a steamer from Anqing to Guichi. A comrade from the dam reinforcement headquarters on the steamer saw that he was a military family member and was very close to him. As a result, he stole eleven items of clothing, including quilts, bedsheets, uniforms, thermal underwear, and raincoats.
    Based on the above situation, I suggest that the leadership organs of troops in various places should educate every active serviceman not to casually send military family certificates to collateral relatives. If it is necessary to send them, they should also educate collateral relatives to recognize that the military family certificate represents the honor given to military families by the state and must be carefully safeguarded to prevent it from falling into the hands of bad people and causing adverse consequences.

### 认真保管复员军人证和军属证

    认真保管复员军人证和军属证
    （一）编辑同志：
    近来我县连续发生了复员军人的证件被骗、被盗和被遗失的事件。五区复员军人孙台阁回家还不到半个月，在集上买东西时就被扒手窃走了复员军人证明书和八十多元钱。城关镇复员建设军人申庆云，在县里开防汛工作会议时将上衣脱下放在屋里，结果衣服连同放在衣兜里的复员军人证明书一起被人偷去。六区界牌镇复员建设军人吴惕在回乡途中就把复员证明书遗失了。这种情况，在其它各县也发生过。
    反革命分子为了伪造历史混进革命机关进行破坏活动，就要千方百计地盗窃或伪造革命机关的各种证件。因此一切复员军人都应该提高革命警惕性，保管好自己的证件。

    （二）编辑同志：
    最近，我们安徽枞阳县发现了一起坏分子盗窃革命军人家属证明书而冒充军属、扰乱社会治安的事件。这一事件的经过如下：江西军区宁都军分区某营教导员刘永同志（枞阳县汤沟镇人）在一九五四年下半年曾把革命军人证明书寄给他的养父刘南祥。刘南祥因为不是刘永的直系亲属，同时生活上没有什么困难，不需要政府照顾，就将军属证随便乱丢，被惯窃刘敦材偷走了。刘犯偷了军属证，到处乱窜，进行偷窃。一九五四年十一月六日，刘敦材从安庆乘轮船到贵池，在轮船上的堵口复堤指挥部的某同志看到他是军属，同他很接近，结果被他偷走被子、被单、制服、卫生衣、雨衣等衣物十一件。
    根据以上情况，我建议各地部队领导机关应该教育每个现役军人不要将军属证随便寄给旁系亲属；如果必须寄给的，在寄去时也应该教育旁系亲属认识军属证代表着国家给军属的荣誉，必须认真保管，不要让它落入坏人手里，造成不良后果。
