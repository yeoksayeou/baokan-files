    Tractor Factory Construction Preparation Work Completed
    The construction preparation work for the tractor factory has been completed, and the construction of the factory buildings is about to begin.
    In the factory area of the tractor factory, the previously overgrown weeds and exploratory pits and wells are gone, and what can now be seen is a flat and open area. On this land, the locations of the factory building foundations to be constructed this year have been surveyed by surveyors, with white lime lines drawn on them and neat wooden stakes driven in. Construction machinery has been moved in. In the offices of the construction units, the walls are covered with construction drawings. Engineers, construction workers, foremen, and heads of various relevant departments have studied these drawings in detail. The workers have also listened to the explanations of the construction drawings by engineering and technical personnel, and are enthusiastically waiting for the official start of construction.
    Workers in various processing plants of the tractor factory are rushing to manufacture various prefabricated components for construction. The welders in the steel bar workshop of the reinforced concrete component factory have improved their skills and increased production through mutual teaching and learning. The daily output of the lumbering workshop of the lumber processing plant has exceeded the original plan by 38 percent. The products produced by the foam cement factory are placed in the factory like walls. Once the construction site needs them, vehicles in the parking lot can immediately load and transport them from the processing plant or warehouse to the site. The electricity and water for construction are also ready. (Xinhua News Agency)

    拖拉机制造厂施工准备工作完成
    拖拉机制造厂施工准备工作已经完成，厂房工程即将开始施工。
    在拖拉机制造厂厂区，往日丛生的杂草和探坑、探井已经没有了，现在所见到的是一片平坦的开阔地。在这块土地上，今年施工的厂房基础的位置，已由测量员测量好了，上面划着一条条白色的灰线和打着整齐的木桩。施工的机具已经搬来了。在施工单位的办公室里，墙上满挂着施工图。工程师、施工员、工长和各有关部门的负责人，曾经详尽地研究了这些图纸，工人们也听取了工程技术人员对施工图纸的讲解，正热情地等待正式施工时刻的到来。
    拖拉机制造厂各个加工厂的工人们正在赶制施工的各种预制品。钢筋混凝土构件厂的钢筋车间电焊组工人们由于互教互学，提高了技术，增加了产量。木材加工厂制材车间的日产量，已超过原计划百分之三十八。泡沫水泥厂生产的产品，已像围墙一样地放在厂里，一旦工地上需要，停车场上的车辆，马上就可以从加工厂或仓库里装运到现场。施工用的电力和水也都准备好了。　（新华社）
