To the Editorial Staff:

The Fushun Mining Bureau's Open-Pit Coal Mine is poorly managed, and nearby residents and some family members of coal mine workers frequently and brazenly go to the mine to take coal. The situation is most serious in several locations in the open-pit mine, including Nanchang, West Bengyan, Lower Plate Eighteen Rolls, Deep Lower Old Open-Pit, Yangbaikeng Lower, and Thirty Rolls. In the most serious cases, more than ten tons of coal are taken away each day, and in less serious cases, six or seven tons of coal are taken away each day. Those who take the coal not only steal the wealth of the state but also seriously hinder production. For example, people often go to take coal below the West Bengyan dumping ground, and if workers drop large rocks when tipping trucks above, it could cause personal injury accidents, so the tipping work cannot proceed normally. Also, on one occasion, bad elements taking coal at the Upper Second Level dug out the transportation line, nearly causing a major accident of vehicle derailment.

This situation also makes it impossible for the Fushun City fuel supply department to accurately grasp the entire coal consumption pattern. For example, in Nanyaodi, there are 1,300 households, most of whom do not buy coal, and each household regularly stores two or three tons of coal. In addition, there are many coal peddlers circulating in the market every day, and their goods are also stolen.

What is strange is that the Fushun Municipal People's Committee and the Fushun Mining Bureau and other relevant leading departments are turning a blind eye to this theft and letting it happen. Therefore, the people taking the coal are becoming more and more rampant, and even not long ago, there was an incident of beating up the open-pit mine police. The open-pit mine is a state-owned enterprise, not a "take what you need" "coal depot." To prevent further loss of state property, I suggest that relevant leading organs immediately stop this theft and take appropriate action against the relevant derelict personnel.

### 一个“各取所需”的“煤库”

    一个“各取所需”的“煤库”编辑同志：
    抚顺矿务局露天煤矿管理不严，附近的居民和一部分煤矿职工家属经常明目张胆地跑到矿场去拿煤。在露天矿的南昌、西崩岩、下盘十八卷、深部下边的旧露天、杨柏坑下和三十卷等几个地方情况最为严重，多的每天要被拿走十吨以上的煤，少的每天也要被拿走六、七吨煤。拿煤的人不但盗窃了国家的财富，而且严重地妨碍了生产。像西崩岩舍场下面经常有人去拿煤，工人在上面翻车的时候如果把大块石头丢下去，会造成人身事故，因此翻车工作就不能正常进行。又如有一次在上二段拿煤的坏分子把运输线扒空，险些造成车辆脱轨的重大事故。
    这种情况还使抚顺市的燃料供应部门不能准确地掌握全部的煤炭消耗规律。像南窑地有一千三百户居民，大部分都不买煤，而且每户都经常存有二、三吨煤炭；另外每天市场上流动的煤贩子也很多，他们的货也都是盗窃来的。
    令人奇怪的是，抚顺市人民委员会和抚顺矿务局等有关领导部门对这种盗窃行为竟然熟视无睹，听之任之。因此，拿煤的人越来越猖獗了，甚至不久以前还曾发生了殴打露天矿警察的事件。露天矿是国家的企业，而不是“各取所需”的“煤库”。为了使国家财产不再受到损失，我建议有关领导机关立即制止这种盗窃行为，并对有关失职人员进行适当的处理。杜文元
