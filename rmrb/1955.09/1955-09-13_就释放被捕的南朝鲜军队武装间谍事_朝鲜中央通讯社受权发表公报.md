Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th: The Korean Central News Agency, on the 12th, issued the following authorized communiqué regarding the release of captured armed spies of the South Korean army:

    The armed spies belonging to the 702nd District Team of the South Korean Army Intelligence Unit, who illegally intruded into our coastal waters off Unmu Island, North Pyongan Province, on July 22, 1955, and attacked and looted peaceful fishermen engaged in fishing, and were subsequently arrested by the Coast Guard of the Republic, have been released by our side on September 12, 1955.

    The crimes committed by these armed spies released by our side this time are serious. However, considering that these armed spies engaged in espionage activities due to the oppression and coercion of the US side and the South Korean military authorities and not of their own volition, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, based on the policy of leniency and the spirit of humanitarianism, has taken measures to release them so that they can live peaceful lives.

    Among the aforementioned personnel who have been released, those whose hometowns are in North Korea will return to their original places of residence according to their own wishes to live peaceful lives; for those who originally resided in South Korea, necessary measures will also be taken to enable them to return to their hometowns according to their own wishes to live peaceful lives.

    就释放被捕的南朝鲜军队武装间谍事
    朝鲜中央通讯社受权发表公报
    新华社平壤十二日电　朝鲜中央通讯社在十二日就释放被捕的南朝鲜军队武装间谍事受权发表公报如下：
    一九五五年七月二十二日非法侵入我方沿海平安北道云雾岛界线袭击和劫掠正在捕鱼的和平渔民后被共和国海岸警备队逮捕的南朝鲜国军陆军谍报队第七零二地区队所属武装间谍，已经在一九五五年九月十二日被我方释放。
    这次被我方释放的这些武装间谍的罪行是严重的。但是，鉴于这些武装间谍从事间谍活动是由于美国方面和南朝鲜军事当局的压制和强迫而并非他们的本意，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府根据宽大政策和人道主义精神，采取了释放他们的措施，使他们得以过和平生活。
    在被释放的上述人员中，凡是其家乡在北朝鲜的，将按照他们自己的希望回到原来居住的地方过和平生活；对于原居住在南朝鲜的，也将采取必要措施，使他们得以按照自己的希望回到家乡过和平生活。
