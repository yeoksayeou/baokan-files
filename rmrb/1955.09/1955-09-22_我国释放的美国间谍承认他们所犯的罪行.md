Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 20th. The Hong Kong newspaper "New Evening Post" published on the 18th a written statement in Chinese made by Li Ke, an American spy who was deported by the Chinese government, to the newspaper's reporter on the 18th.

    Li Ke wrote: "First, I want to make it clear that I am a spy and have seriously violated the laws of the People's Republic of China. During World War II, I served as a Japanese translator in the Marine Corps for the U.S. Naval Intelligence Department. After the war, I continued to serve as a reserve lieutenant in the Marine Corps. In August 1948, I received a scholarship from the American China Foundation and came to China to study Chinese. Shortly before I left the United States, the intelligence section of the 13th Naval District Headquarters in Seattle called me in for a meeting. During the meeting, they asked me to collect intelligence for them after I arrived in China. After arriving in China at the end of 1948, I provided military and political intelligence to Mr. Clubb, the American Consul in Beijing, and Mr. 法约翰, the Vice Consul, until the American Consulate was withdrawn in May 1950." Li Ke then wrote: "I was arrested in July 1951. After being arrested, because I knew that my crimes could not be concealed, I finally confessed. After being arrested, I have always been treated leniently and have not encountered any abuse or oppression. In these four years, I have had a good opportunity to consider my crimes. I deeply realize that I should not go to other people's countries to try to force them to accept the social system that I like."

    Li Ke also said: "In these years, I have also seen the improvement of the lives of the Chinese people and some of China's economic construction. The food we eat in prison is getting better year by year. I see that the clothes people wear are also getting better year by year. In the past, few people wore leather shoes, but now ordinary workers can afford them. From Beijing to Guangzhou, I see new factories, hospitals, and schools everywhere. The people seem to be very happy and optimistic, which is completely different from the situation five years ago."

    Li Ke said: "With China's rapid and continuous economic development, it is now a huge market. I also believe that if the U.S. government abandons its previous unreasonable blockade and embargo policy, and on the basis of mutual benefit and equality, there will be unlimited development of Sino-American trade. This is beneficial to China and also beneficial to the United States, and it is also the best foundation for safeguarding peace. I am an American. I love my country. I feel from the bottom of my heart that war can only bring a very great disaster to us Americans. So I now have the greatest determination to use all my strength to strive for world peace, especially the friendly relations between the Chinese and American people."

    Li Ke finally said: "Finally, there is one more thing I want to say about the issue of civilian repatriation. I was originally sentenced to six years, but because I received the leniency of the Chinese people, I was released early and received the greatest care during the repatriation process. I have great hope that the U.S. government will use the same spirit to assist the Chinese people to be repatriated in the United States."

    我国释放的美国间谍承认他们所犯的罪行
    新华社广州二十日电　香港“新晚报”十八日刊出了被中国政府遣送出境的美国间谍李克十八日对该报记者发表一篇用中文写成的书面谈话。
    李克写道：“首先，我要说清楚我是一个间谍，严重地违反了中华人民共和国的法律。在第二次世界大战中，我担任了美国海军情报部在海军陆战队里的日文翻译官。战后我继续当了海军陆战队的后补中尉。在一九四八年八月我得到一个美国在华基金委员会的奖学金来到中国学习中文。我离开美国之前不久，美国在西雅图的第十三海军区总部情报科叫我来跟他们会报。在会报的时候，他们要我到达中国以后替他们收集情报。一九四八年底，来到中国以后我收军事政治情报供给美国驻北京的领事柯乐博和副领事法约翰一直到美国领事馆在一九五零年五月撤退的时候。”李克接着写道：“我在一九五一年七月被捕。被捕以后因为我知道我的罪行掩不了，我最后坦白了。被捕以后我一直受到宽大待遇，没有遇到一点虐待和欺压。在这四年多内我有了一个很好的机会考虑考虑我的罪行。我深刻认识到我不应该到别的人的国家去想强迫他们接受我喜欢的社会制度。”
    李克又说：“我这几年也看到些中国的人民的生活的提高和一些中国的经济建设。我们在监狱的伙食一年比一年好。我看到人们所穿的衣服也一年比一年好。以前很少人穿皮鞋，现在普通的工作人员都可以穿得上。我从北京到广州，到处看到新的工厂，医院和学校。人民好像都是很愉快的很乐观，跟五年前的情形根本不一样。”
    李克说：“在中国很快的、不断的经济发展情况下它现在是一个巨大的市场。我也相信如果美国政府放弃它以前的无理封锁禁运政策，在一个互利平等基础上，中美贸易要有无限的发展。这个对中国有利也是对美国有利，它也是保障和平最好的基础。我是一个美国人。我爱我的祖国。我从内心感觉到战争只可以给我们美国人民带来一个非常大的灾难。所以我现在有最大的决心用一切力量争取世界和平，尤其是中美人民的友好关系。”
    李克最后说：“最后还有一句话我要说，关于平民遣返的问题。我原来被判决六年，因为受了中国人民的宽大，我被提前释放而且在遣返的过程中，受到最大的照顾。我有很大的希望，美国政府要用一样的精神协助在美国要遣返的中国人。”
