Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: According to TASS, the strike of transportation workers in Paris continues. On the 18th, buses in Paris were almost completely out of service, and only three of the fifteen subway lines were operating.

Strikes have also occurred in France's metal processing industry, coal mines, construction companies, chemical industry, and other industrial sectors.

In the Renault automobile factory, thirty-three workshops temporarily stopped work on the 17th, with workers demanding a wage increase of 40 francs per hour. At the Dunlop factory in Montluçon, Allier province, 4,000 workers went on strike. "L'Humanité" reported that farmers, merchants, and even some city and town councils in the province were supporting the striking workers. In Saint-Étienne, 5,000 construction workers have been on strike for several days.

According to newspaper reports, those currently participating in the strike movement also include 1,500 workers in various construction companies, 2,000 metalworkers in Cholet (Maine-et-Loire), 1,600 workers in oil refineries in Gonfreville-l'Orcher (near Le Havre), 2,000 workers in construction companies in Brest, several thousand metalworkers in the Paris region, and many other workers.

"L'Humanité" published a statement from the Politburo of the French Communist Party. The Politburo expressed its support for the working people fighting for their economic rights and pointed out that as a result of the united action of Communist Party members and grassroots members of the Socialist Party, as well as unions affiliated with the French "Workers' Force," the French Confederation of Christian Workers, and other trade union federations, the wages of hundreds of thousands of metalworkers and construction workers have been greatly increased.

The Politburo said that it is entirely possible to improve the material situation of all types of working people in France by reducing the profits of capitalist companies and reducing non-productive expenditures on the arms race and colonial policies in North Africa.

The Politburo called on party organizations at all levels and all party members to lead the French working class in the struggle to win satisfaction of their just demands.

    法共政治局声援工人争取经济权利的斗争
    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎市交通工人的罢工仍在继续中，十八日巴黎的公共汽车几乎完全停驶了，地下电车道的十五条线路只有三条线路有电车驶行。
    在法国的金属加工工业、煤矿、建筑企业、化学工业以及其他工业部门中，也发生了罢工运动。
    在雷诺汽车工厂各厂中有三十三个车间在十七日暂时停止了工作，工人们要求每小时增加工资四十法郎。在阿里埃省蒙律松市的邓禄普工厂中，有四千个工人罢工。“人道报”报道，这个省的农民、商人、甚至一些城市和村镇的市议会都在支持罢工工人。在圣亚田，建筑企业的五千个工人已经罢工好几天了。
    根据报纸的材料，目前参加罢工运动的，还有各建筑企业的一千五百个工人、萧尔市（麦茵—罗亚尔省）的两千个五金工人、冈弗里维尔—罗尔什（哈佛尔附近）各石油提炼工厂的一千六百个工人、布勒斯特各建筑企业的两千个工人、巴黎区的几千个五金工人以及其他许多工人。
    “人道报”发表了法国共产党政治局的声明。政治局表示声援为争取自己的经济权利而斗争的劳动人民，并且指出：由于共产党人和社会党基层组织的党员以及法国“工人力量”、法国天主教劳工联盟以及其他工会联合会所属工会行动一致的结果，几十万五金工人和建筑工人的工资已经大大增加了。
  政治局说：现在完全可以用减少资本主义公司的利润以及缩减在军备竞赛和在北非的殖民政策方面的非生产开支的办法，来改善法国各类劳动人民的物质情况。
    政治局号召全党各级组织和全体党员领导法国工人阶级为争取满足自己的正义要求而斗争。
