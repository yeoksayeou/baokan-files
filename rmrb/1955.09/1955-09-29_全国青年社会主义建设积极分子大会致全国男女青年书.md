Comrades, dear young men and women of the whole country:

We, one thousand five hundred and twenty-seven young men and women of all nationalities, have come to Beijing, the capital of our great motherland, to attend the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism. We have received the kind teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, listened to the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and reported on our work to the motherland. As we are about to leave Beijing and Tiananmen Square, we feel even more that these have been exciting and unforgettable days.

During these days, the Party and the state have given us high honor and have also put forward extremely glorious combat tasks to us and the youth of the whole country. How much the Party values and cares for our younger generation! Could ordinary young people like us, like us poor children who were once looked down upon, have received such attention and care in the old society? No. Only a country like ours attaches such importance to us, and only our great Communist Party cares for us in this way!

Comrades, the Party has solemnly pointed out to us that a new page in history has been opened in our great motherland. This is the era of socialist revolution that we are facing. Our task is to build a prosperous and strong socialist republic in a country that accounts for a quarter of the world's population. Our beloved leader said that this is "an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before." The First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is to lay a solid foundation for this undertaking. In the ranks of the Chinese people advancing towards socialism, the Party and Chairman Mao have special expectations for us young people, regarding us as a shock force, as a huge assault force.

The Party calls on us to actively participate in socialist industrial construction. Let the young people standing on industrial posts answer loudly: We must actively participate in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, make the labor competition lively, and everyone become a warrior on the industrial front.

The Party calls on us to actively participate in the agricultural cooperation movement. Let the vast number of rural youth answer loudly: We must use the greatest enthusiasm and courage to develop the socialist revolutionary base in the countryside and welcome the high tide of agricultural cooperation. We must abandon the erroneous idea that agricultural production is not promising and create a happy and beautiful hometown with our own hands.

The Party calls on the youth of all walks of life to do a good job in their respective posts. Let us answer loudly: We must be faithful to our duties and do every ordinary and small thing that is conducive to the cause of socialism with creative labor. Give one point of heat and emit one point of light, and make more contributions to the motherland.

The Party calls on us to learn culture and technology with the same tenacious spirit as fighting the enemy, and to march towards science. Let us answer loudly: We must cherish time, squeeze out time, study hard, and arm ourselves with all the knowledge and struggle experience of the revolutionary elders and the working people.

The Party calls on us to raise revolutionary vigilance and defend the motherland. Let us answer loudly: We will never allow a foreign enemy to set foot on the land of the motherland, and we will not allow a hidden counter-revolutionary element to hide among us. We must contribute our greatest strength to the liberation of Taiwan, to the defense of the motherland's security and world peace.

Comrades, the Party's call is our program of action. We must prove ourselves to be loyal sons and daughters of the great motherland and a generation nurtured by the Party and Chairman Mao with our heroic labor. As a new upsurge in the construction of socialism by the Chinese people is about to arrive, let us all say: We must be an active element in socialist construction. We must all strive to be an active element in socialist construction.

Comrades, the Party and the state have made it possible for us to contribute our intelligence and strength to the great motherland. We who attended the conference, from jet pilots flying high in the sky to agricultural cooperative accountants, from steelworkers to shepherdesses, from scientific researchers to forest hunters, from exploration team members to primary school teachers, and even to breeders, shop assistants, postmen, midwives, cooks, and people's police, have all been valued by the Party and the state. This shows that in our country, the Party has opened up the broadest and most glorious road for us!

Comrades! Let us advance heroically on this glorious road!

Let us complete the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule!

May our country be more prosperous!

Long live our beloved motherland!

Long live the great and glorious Communist Party of China!

Long live our great leader and respected teacher Chairman Mao!

    全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会致全国男女青年书亲爱的全国男女青年同志们：
    我们，一千五百二十七名各民族的男女青年，来到伟大祖国的首都北京，出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。我们领受了党中央和毛主席的亲切教导，听取了团中央的报告，向祖国汇报了工作。在我们即将离开北京，离开天安门的时候，我们更感到这是一段振奋而难忘的日子。
    在这段日子里，党和国家给了我们很高的荣誉，也向我们和全国青年提出了极其光荣的战斗任务。党对我们年轻一代是多么地重视和关怀呵！像我们这些普普通通的年轻人，像我们这些曾经被人瞧不起的苦孩子，在旧社会里得到过这样的重视和关怀吗？没有。只有我们这样的国家，才对我们这样的重视，只有我们伟大的共产党，才对我们这样的关怀！
    同志们，党向我们严肃地指出：在我们伟大的祖国，一页新的历史已经揭开了。这就是我们面对着的社会主义革命的时代。我们的任务，就是要在一个占全世界人口四分之一的国家里，建设起一个繁荣昌盛的社会主义共和国。我们敬爱的领袖说，这是“我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，就是要给这个事业打下牢固的基础。在中国人民向社会主义前进的行列里，党和毛主席对我们青年怀着特别深切的期望，把我们当作一支冲锋部队，当作一支巨大的突击力量。
    党号召我们积极参加社会主义的工业建设。让我们站在工业岗位上的青年响亮地回答：我们一定要积极参加增产节约运动，把劳动竞赛搞得热火朝天，人人都成为工业战线上的勇士。
    党号召我们积极参加农业合作化运动。让我们广大的农村青年响亮地回答：我们一定要用最大的热情和勇气，去发展农村的社会主义的革命阵地，迎接农业合作化的高潮。我们要抛掉那种认为农业生产没有出息的错误想法，用自己的双手去创造幸福美丽的家乡。
    党号召我们各行各业的青年都要做好本岗位的工作。让我们响亮地回答：我们一定要忠实于自己的职守，用创造性的劳动做好每一件有利于社会主义事业的平凡、细小的工作，有一分热，发一分光，为祖国作出更多的贡献。
    党号召我们要拿同敌人作战一样的顽强精神去学文化，学技术，向科学进军。让我们响亮地回答：我们一定要珍惜时间，挤出时间，刻苦学习，用革命长辈、劳动人民的全部知识和斗争经验把自己武装起来。
    党号召我们提高革命警惕性，保卫祖国。让我们响亮地回答：我们一定不让一个外来的敌人踏上祖国的土地，不让一个暗藏的反革命分子隐藏在我们身边。我们一定要为解放台湾，为保卫祖国的安全和世界和平，贡献出自己最大的力量。
    同志们，党的号召就是我们战斗的纲领。我们一定要以自己英勇的劳动，证明自己不愧是伟大祖国人民的忠实儿女，是党和毛主席所亲手教养出来的一代。在中国人民建设社会主义新的高潮就要到来的时候，让我们大家都这样说：我们一定要做一个社会主义建设的积极分子。我们人人都要努力争取做一个社会主义建设的积极分子。
    同志们，党和国家使我们有一切可能把自己的聪明才智和力量贡献给伟大的祖国。我们出席大会的人，从飞翔在高空的喷气式飞机的驾驶员到农业合作社的会计，从炼钢工人到牧羊姑娘，从科学研究工作者到山林的猎手，从勘探队员到小学教师，一直到饲养员、售货员、邮递员、接生员、炊事员、人民警察，都受到了党和国家的重视。这说明在我们的国家里，党已经给我们开辟了最宽阔最光荣的道路！
    同志们！让我们在这条光荣的道路上英勇地前进！
    让我们发展国民经济的第一个五年计划提前完成！
    让我们的国家更加兴旺！
    我们亲爱的祖国万岁！
    伟大的，光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖和敬爱的导师毛主席万岁！
                一九五五年九月二十八日社论
