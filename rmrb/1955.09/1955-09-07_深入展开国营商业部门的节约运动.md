    Deepen the Savings Campaign in State-Owned Commercial Departments
    State-owned commerce is a sector of the national economy with a vast operational scale and numerous organizational structures. The volume of goods sold and currency recovered by state-owned commerce annually, monthly, and daily holds a primary position in the market. According to the Five-Year Plan, the total retail sales of social commodities nationwide will reach approximately 49.8 billion yuan in 1957, of which state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce will account for 54.9 percent. This is a massive undertaking of commodity organization and distribution. If we are not careful about thrift in these activities, even minor instances of waste can result in losses of tens of thousands of yuan. Conversely, if we can practice strict economy and avoid waste, we can accumulate substantial wealth for the country. Therefore, it is extremely important to rigorously practice thrift and oppose waste in the state-owned commercial system.
    Starting from the second quarter of this year, state-owned commercial departments across the country, under the leadership of local Party committees and People's Committees, have successively launched campaigns to practice thrift and oppose waste. Preliminary materials revealed by various units indicate that there is considerable waste in state-owned commercial departments in commodity procurement, sales, allocation, transportation, warehousing, expense spending, and capital construction. According to statistics from the commercial departments, property losses in the national state-owned commercial system in 1954 amounted to 55,112,530 yuan, an increase of 66.7 percent compared to 1953. Of this, excessive commodity spoilage accounted for 57.35 percent, fines and compensation payments accounted for 11.99 percent, losses from deterioration and spoilage accounted for 0.62 percent, and other losses due to negligence, embezzlement, and wasteful operating expenses were also significant. Losses of commodities in state-owned commercial departments not only waste a lot of industrial and agricultural raw materials and the labor of workers and peasants, but also prevent a large number of useful commodities from meeting the needs of consumers, thereby directly affecting the development of production and the improvement of the people's material living standards. Therefore, thrift in state-owned commercial departments is not just a matter of profit and loss for the department itself, but has extremely broad significance.
    In order to overcome various forms of waste and save state funds, commercial departments in some areas have formulated specific thrift measures based on the results of work inspections and the waste phenomena exposed by the masses, stipulated current measures, or adopted "topic rewards" to mobilize the masses to solve certain key problems. However, there are still many units where the work is not thorough, the measures are not specific, and generally only a few mobilizations have been made, the masses have been mobilized to expose some facts of loss and waste, and finally a rough plan is put forward, such as reducing circulation costs by a few percentage points, reducing non-productive expenditures by a few percentage points, and so on. At the beginning of the plan, no in-depth inspection of the work was carried out, no research was done on the aspects that should be promoted and reformed, and no precise calculations were made. After the plan was put forward, it was not discussed in depth and extensively among the masses, so that every employee or shop assistant knew their specific tasks in the struggle to complete the plan. As a result, some of these savings plans lack reliable basis; some have a certain basis, but lack specific measures, and it is difficult for employees to implement them. In order to change this situation and make the struggle to practice thrift and oppose waste truly effective, we must take the savings campaign in state-owned commercial departments a step further, and we must oppose generalized appeals and empty plans.
    The current state of the savings campaign in state-owned commercial departments reflects that the leadership style of some leading personnel in the state-owned commercial system is still not thorough. They rarely understand the specific situation of grass-roots units on weekdays, and they have not conducted in-depth inspections and research on the causes of waste in the savings campaign. Of course, they cannot put forward specific measures to overcome waste. A commercial bureau in a certain city put forward indicators such as accelerating capital turnover and reducing circulation costs, but it did not have specific measures to achieve these indicators. It only "decided to extensively and deeply carry out political and ideological work," "launch a production increase and savings labor competition centered on improving business management and comprehensively and balancedly completing the state plan on the premise of correctly implementing policies," "At the same time, it is required to work hard to expand sales, accelerate commodity circulation, strengthen and improve wholesale business, and establish and improve various systems in commodity procurement, sales, allocation, and storage...". How can this kind of generalized and empty call mobilize the masses? How can the savings campaign be deepened? To change this situation, we must seriously improve the style of leading personnel in these departments and earnestly learn from the experience of other units in the commercial sector and other departments of the state. For example, the thrift measures in the capital construction of commercial departments are relatively specific, so the results of thrift are relatively large. For example, after inspecting the newly built railway work in the Southwest and Northwest regions, the leading comrades of the Ministry of Railways formulated 60 specific thrift measures, so that the railway system can not only avoid waste in the current projects, but also have something to follow in the future construction of new lines. These experiences are worth referring to and learning from.
    To take the savings campaign in state-owned commercial departments a step further, it is also necessary to give full play to the initiative and creativity of all employees and shop assistants in state-owned commercial departments in all aspects. The business of state-owned commerce is expanding rapidly, the variety of commodities managed is very large, and there are many links in circulation, and the commercial institutions are very scattered. Therefore, the savings campaign in commercial departments requires very complicated political and organizational work, which is a difficult task. But it must also be seen that commercial work is less affected by natural and technical conditions, but more affected by human power. As long as all staff can actively study and think of ways to improve their work subjectively, they can find many ways to save. For example, the Food Company of the Ministry of Commerce suffered serious losses in the second half of last year and the first half of this year due to poor management, and this year was even worse than last year. Many people did not check from the lack of subjective efforts, but simply attributed it to the difficulty of food management. However, within the Food Company, there are also very good experiences. For example, in the past, the cost of transporting live pigs was high, and there were many deaths and injuries. After adopting the double-layer loading method for transporting pigs in the first quarter of this year, more pigs were transported and costs were saved. For example, it is very difficult to store eggs, but thanks to the efforts of the staff of the egg products team of the Libao Purchasing Station of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Company, the weigher helps to pick up eggs gently whenever farmers come to sell them. The eggs collected are put into clean, dry baskets, and they are transported as soon as they are collected. During the rainy season, they use one-foot-high sleepers to pad the bottom of the baskets and pay attention to storage at all times. All the more than 80,000 kilograms of fresh eggs purchased throughout 1954 were not damaged. There are many similar examples, which shows that even in difficult positions, as long as commercial staff make subjective efforts, they can create many outstanding achievements.
    The savings methods of state-owned commercial departments must be specifically stipulated according to the different conditions of different regions and different businesses. But in general, state-owned commercial departments in various places should focus on reducing commodity circulation costs, accelerating capital turnover, strengthening property management systems, and saving capital construction expenses. According to statistics from commercial departments, if the capital turnover of state-owned commercial departments can be accelerated by 0.1 times on the existing basis, and the level of commodity circulation costs can be reduced by 1 percent, the state can save 1 billion yuan a year. If the property management system is improved, mutual arrears are eliminated, and credit work is improved, external debts can be reduced by more than 300 million yuan this year, and the interest alone can save more than 1,000 yuan. Although the proportion of capital construction investment in the state-owned commercial system in the total national investment is not large, after careful calculation and the adoption of various specific measures to reduce construction costs, the original construction plan remains unchanged, but the investment figures can be reduced by 77.7 million yuan, which shows that the potential for savings in this area is also very large. In all of the above aspects, there are already some advanced experiences and good practices in the commercial sector, and we must pay attention to promoting them in the future. For example, due to strengthening planning, normal commodity circulation, and saving expenses, the Guizhou Provincial Petroleum Company accelerated the current capital of the entire provincial petroleum company system by 0.09 times in the first half of this year, and accelerated the turnover of commodity funds by one time, saving a total of more than 20,000 yuan in interest, thus overfulfilling the task of handing over profits by 9 percent. For example, after the new commercial credit method was tried out in the Coal Industry Building Materials Company system in the fourth quarter of last year, the commercial credit owed to and owed by the company was reduced by 89.33 percent compared with the previous one, which greatly accelerated capital turnover and improved planning management work. In many other places, the original commercial equipment in society is actively used to expand business and save capital construction investment. These methods should be widely publicized, and various places should be organized to learn and promote them.
    In order to make thrift a lasting system and achieve the desired results, local Party committees should further strengthen their leadership over state-owned commercial departments. Party organizations and trade union organizations in state-owned commercial departments in various places should earnestly strengthen ideological and organizational work, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees, and improve the management of state-owned commerce through the struggle to practice thrift and oppose waste, so as to ensure the smooth completion of commercial tasks in the Five-Year Plan.

### 深入展开国营商业部门的节约运动

    深入展开国营商业部门的节约运动
    国营商业是国民经济部门中经营规模巨大和组织机构很多的一个部门。国营商业每年、每月、每日销售的商品和回笼的货币之多，在市场上占居首要地位。根据五年计划的规定，一九五七年全国的社会商品零售总额将达到四百九十八亿元左右，其中国营商业和合作社商业占百分之五十四点九。这是一个巨大的商品组织工作和分配工作，在这些工作中如果稍不注意节约，即使是点滴的浪费，动辄也会带来成千成万元的损失，而如果能够厉行节约，避免浪费，就能给国家积累大笔财富。因此，在国营商业系统厉行节约、反对浪费，是十分重要的。
    从今年第二季度开始，全国各地国营商业部门在各地党委和人民委员会的领导下，先后开展了厉行节约、反对浪费的运动。从各单位初步揭发的材料来看，国营商业部门在商品进销、调拨、运输、仓储保管、费用开支以及在基本建设等方面，都有不少的浪费。根据商业部门的统计，一九五四年全国国营商业系统财产损失达五千五百一十二万五千三百元，较一九五三年增加了百分之六十六点七，其中商品的超定额损耗占百分之五十七点三五，罚款和赔偿款占百分之一十一点九九，变质霉烂的损失占百分之零点六二，其他因过失、贪污舞弊的损失和经营费用的浪费也很大。国营商业部门商品的损失，不仅浪费了很多工农业原材料，浪费了工人和农民的劳动，也使大量有用的商品不能供应消费者的需要，从而直接影响生产的发展和人民物质生活水平的提高。因此，国营商业部门的节约，不只是关系本部门盈亏的问题，而且具有极其广泛的意义。
    为了克服各种浪费，节约国家的资金，有些地方的商业部门已经根据工作检查的结果和群众揭发的浪费现象，制定了一些具体的节约办法，规定了当前的措施，或者采用“课题悬赏”，发动群众来解决某些关键性的问题。但是，也还有不少单位的工作不深入，办法不具体，一般的只是作了几次动员，发动群众揭发了一些损失浪费的事实，最后提出一个大约的计划，例如降低流转费用百分之几，减少非生产性开支百分之几等等。在提计划之初，既没有深入检查工作，研究应兴应革的方面，进行精密的计算，而在计划提出之后，也没有在群众中进行深入广泛的讨论，使每一个职工或店员知道在完成计划的斗争中自己的具体任务。因而这些节约的计划有的是缺乏可靠的根据；有的虽有一定根据，但没有具体办法，职工们也很难贯彻执行。为了改变这种状况，使厉行节约反对浪费的斗争真正收到实效，就必须把国营商业部门的节约运动深入一步，必须反对一般化的号召和空洞的计划。
    国营商业部门节约运动的现状，反映了某些国营商业系统领导工作人员的领导作风是还不深入的，他们平日对基层单位的具体情况很少了解，在节约运动中又没有深入检查和研究浪费的原因，当然也就提不出克服浪费的具体办法。有一个市的商业局，提出了加速资金周转、降低流转费用等指标，但是却没有实现这些指标的具体办法，只是“决定广泛深入地进行政治思想工作”，“开展在正确贯彻政策前提下，以改善经营管理，全面均衡地完成国家计划为中心的增产节约劳动竞赛”，“同时，要求努力扩大推销、加速商品流转、加强和改进批发业务，并建立和健全商品进销、调拨、储存工作中的各项制度……。”像这种一般化的空洞的号召，如何能动员群众呢？如何能使节约运动深入下去呢？要改变这种状况，就必须认真改进这些部门领导工作人员的作风，切实学习商业部门其它单位和国家其它部门的经验。例如商业部门基本建设的节约措施就是比较具体的，因而节约的成绩也就比较大。又如铁道部的领导同志，检查了西南、西北地区的新建铁路工作后，定出了六十项节约的具体措施，使铁路系统不仅在目前的各项工程中可以避免浪费，而且在今后新线修建中也能有所依循。这些经验，都是值得参考和学习的。
    要把国营商业部门的节约运动深入一步，还需要从各方面发挥国营商业部门全体职工和店员的主动性和创造精神。国营商业的业务扩展很快，经营的商品品种很多，流转环节也很多，而商业机构又很分散，因此，商业部门的节约运动，需要进行十分复杂的政治工作和组织工作，这是一件艰难的工作。但是也必须看到，商业工作受自然条件和技术条件的影响较小，而受人力的影响则较大，只要全体工作人员能在主观上积极钻研，想出改进工作的办法，就可以找到很多节约的办法。例如，商业部的食品公司，由于经营管理工作很差，去年下半年和今年上半年亏损都很严重，而且今年比去年更坏，很多人不从主观努力不够去作检查，而简单地归咎于食品经营困难。可是就在食品公司中，也有很好的经验。如过去载运活猪，费用大，死伤多，今年第一季度采用双层装载法运猪后，运的多了，费用也节省了。又如保管鸡蛋是很困难的，但江苏省食品公司李堡收购站蛋品组，由于工作人员的努力，每当农民来卖鸡蛋，司磅员就帮助轻轻检拾。收来的鸡蛋，装入洁净、干燥的篓内，尽量做到随收随运。在霉雨季节，他们用一尺多高的枕木垫在篓底，时刻注意保管。一九五四年全年收购的八万多斤鲜蛋全部没有损坏。类似这样的例子很多，它说明即使在工作困难的岗位上，只要商业工作人员主观上努力，就可创造出很多优异的成绩。
    国营商业部门节约的办法，必须根据不同地区、不同业务的情况作出具体的规定。但是一般说来，各地国营商业部门都应该以降低商品流转费用、加速资金周转、加强财产管理制度和节约基本建设费用开支为重点。根据商业部门的统计，国营商业部门的资金周转如能在现有基础上加速零点一次，商品流转费用水平如能降低百分之一，一年就可以为国家节约十亿元。如果改进财产管理制度，取消互相拖欠和改进信贷工作，今年就可减少外部欠款三亿元以上，仅利息一项，就可节约一千元以上。国营商业系统基本建设投资在国家总投资中比重虽然不大，但在经过仔细计算，采取各种具体措施降低建筑造价后，原来的建筑计划不变，而投资数字却可以减少七千七百万元，可见这方面节约的潜力也是很大的。而在以上各个方面，在商业部门中都已经有一些先进的经验和好的作法，今后必须注意加以推广。例如贵州省石油公司，由于加强了计划性，商品流转正常，费用开支有节约，今年上半年全省石油公司系统全部流动资金加快零点零九次，商品资金的周转加速一次，共节约利息二万多元，因而超额百分之九完成利润上缴任务。又如去年第四季度在煤业建筑器材公司系统试行新的商业信贷办法后，该公司被人拖欠和拖欠别人的商业信用就较前减少了百分之八十九点三三，大大加速了资金周转，提高了计划管理工作。还有很多地方，积极利用社会上原有商业设备扩大营业，节约基本建设投资。这些办法都应该广泛进行宣传，组织各地学习和推广。
    为了使节约成为持久的制度，收到预期的效果，各地党委也应进一步加强对国营商业部门的领导，各地国营商业部门的党组织和工会组织，应该切实加强思想和组织工作，充分发挥全体职工的积极性和创造性，通过厉行节约反对浪费的斗争，把国营商业的经营管理提高一步，保证五年计划中商业任务的顺利完成。
