Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 26th: According to Soviet newspapers, Soviet agricultural workers who have completed this year's state grain purchase plan are now supplying the state with large quantities of grain above the plan. Among them, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldavia, along with eighteen other states, regions, and autonomous republics, have supplied the state with more than 206.27 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin) above the plan.

Due to the excellent grain harvest this year, the amount of grain purchased by the state in many regions has generally exceeded the level of 1952, the year with the best harvest.

This year's grain harvest in various parts of the Soviet Union is generally good, with particularly good harvests in the main grain-producing areas such as Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and the Volga River basin. Collective farms and state farms in all states of Ukraine have achieved large-scale bumper harvests this year, with an average harvest of 20 to 22 quintals of grain per hectare. The total grain harvest and yield per unit area of many collective farms and state farms have reached the level of 1960 as stipulated in the long-term plan. In the Moldavian Republic, many collective farms and state farms harvested one to one and a half times more grain per hectare than originally planned. In the arid grasslands of the southeastern European part of the Soviet Union, the total grain harvest in Stalingrad Oblast this year has increased to more than three times that of last year. Due to the increase in production, the grain purchased by the state in this oblast by September 10th was more than 87 percent above the original plan. Due to the general bumper harvest, Belgorod Oblast will purchase nearly twice as much grain for the state this year as in 1953, and more than 10 million poods more than in 1954.

Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: Eastern European People's Democratic countries have achieved even greater bumper harvests this year than in previous years.

Poland is celebrating the bumper harvest everywhere. At the All-Poland Harvest Festival held on September 18th, Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, announced with satisfaction: Poland has had a good harvest this year, with an average increase of 100 kilograms in grain yield per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) compared to last year.

In Czechoslovakia, this year's harvest is the largest bumper harvest in the past ten years. The average yield per hectare nationwide reached 3,000 kilograms. Some state farms and unified agricultural production cooperatives have even harvested 4,000 to 4,900 kilograms of wheat and barley per hectare.

Hungary's grain harvest this year far exceeded expectations. According to preliminary statistics, the yield of winter wheat and winter barley per hold (equivalent to 0.57 hectares) in agricultural production cooperatives exceeded 1,000 kilograms and 1,300 kilograms, respectively, and the yield of winter wheat per hold in state farms was over 1,300 kilograms.

Romania's harvest this year is also better than in previous years. The average yield of wheat and barley per hectare in the vast majority of collective farms has reached 2,000 to 3,000 kilograms, and many state farms and collective farms have also harvested 4,000 to 5,000 kilograms of grain per hectare.

In Albania, the grain yield per unit area this year is also better than last year, with bumper harvests of wheat, rye, and barley. Many rice growers harvested about 6,000 kilograms of rice per hectare.

    在捷克斯洛伐克，今年的收成是最近十年来没有过的大丰收。全国每公顷单位面积的平均收获量达到了三千公斤。有些国营农场和统一农业生产合作社并且在每公顷的土地上收获了四千到四千九百公斤的小麦和大麦。
    匈牙利今年谷物的收获量远远超过了预期的数字。据初步统计，农业生产合作社每一霍尔德（合零点五七公顷）冬小麦和冬大麦的产量分别超过了一千公斤和一千三百公斤，国营农场每一霍尔德冬小麦的产量在一千三百公斤以上。
