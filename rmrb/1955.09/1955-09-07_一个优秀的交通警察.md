    An Excellent Traffic Policeman
    Lei Yuanlong
    In the winter of 1954, the northwest wind howled, displaying its power to the people. The usually bustling area around the auditorium in Nanjing City became very quiet, and there were few pedestrians. Only the crisp sound of the bell directing traffic occasionally came from the traffic police booth.
    A car sped from south to north. When it was not far from the intersection of Huaihai Road and Zhongshan South Road, the bell rang, and the red lights on the east and west sides lit up. But at this moment, an old woman was leading three children across the street. A traffic policeman shouted loudly through the microphone:
      "Old woman, stop! A car is coming!"
    The old woman quickened her pace instead, leading two children across the street, leaving a four- or five-year-old child on the other side of the street, who also started running over. At this time, the car was very close to the child. Seeing that the child's life was in danger, the old woman stared blankly. At this critical moment, the traffic policeman rushed over, stopped the child with both hands, and the child fell, hitting his arms. The car whizzed past, just brushing past behind him.
    This traffic policeman is Comrade Lu Guohong, a Youth League member and traffic police squad leader of the Nanjing City Public Security Bureau, who was recently awarded a certificate of commendation by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Youth League. He has consistently completed his tasks outstandingly in maintaining traffic safety for the people. He and all his comrades created eleven "Traffic Safety Months" of excellent achievements and were named a first-class model at the Second Congress of Heroes and Models of the Nanjing City Public Security Bureau.
    Lu Guohong took up the traffic police post assigned to him by the Party as early as 1950. At that time, the motherland had just emerged from the suffering days before liberation, and the material equipment of the traffic police was still very lacking, but this did not diminish his confidence in serving the people. In summer, he was often dizzy from the sun and soaked to the skin by the rain, but he still concentrated and persevered; on winter nights, cold and fatigue attacked him at the same time, and he tried to keep his eyes open and restrained himself. Gradually, he understood the meaning of the traffic police work taught by the Party through his hard work: the work of the traffic police is closely related to the lives and happiness of the people. He felt that without traffic police for a moment, traffic accidents and injuries could occur, which would be detrimental to the country and the people. This sense of pride and honor in the revolutionary cause supported him and enabled him to spend one cheerful winter sleepless night after another, and many hot summer days under the scorching sun. He firmly kept his promise: no matter how difficult it is, he must stick to this glorious post.
    With the progress of the country's large-scale economic construction, there were more and more vehicles on the streets every day. The task placed before every traffic policeman was to better do the traffic safety protection work in socialist construction. Lu Guohong became even more active. Whenever he saw one vehicle after another loaded with equipment, raw materials, and products speeding past him, he was extremely happy. He realized that he had also joined this unprecedented and heroic undertaking. "These vehicles are all to support socialist construction, delivering materials to factories, mines, and rural areas, and are running for the greater happiness of the people in the future. Wouldn't socialism come faster if the vehicles ran more safely and quickly?" Lu Guohong often thought this way and spurred himself on: "To make the vehicles supporting socialist construction run both fast and safely, our burden is heavier, and we need to work harder!"
    Just as the traffic flow on the streets was increasing day by day, the Nanjing City Public Security Bureau issued a call to the traffic police to create "Traffic Safety Year, Safety Team." At this time, Lu Guohong had been promoted to squad leader. He and all his comrades actively responded to the call from higher authorities with practical actions. They understood that to create a "Safety Month," it was not enough to have confidence and determination, but it was necessary to improve their professional skills. Therefore, they strengthened their professional research, found the objective laws of traffic changes from their work, and improved their work. On Sundays, when the traffic flow was the largest, they focused on strengthening police force, especially near several bus stops, paying close attention to pedestrians crossing the street; on ordinary days, when school was dismissed, after work, and when the movie ended, he stood at the intersection to strengthen his shouts, preventing vehicles from driving in violation of regulations. In terms of patrols, in the past, they ran back and forth without focus, and often could not take care of places with many vehicles, horses, and pedestrians. Later, they changed to a key patrol method. In terms of directing traffic at the booth, if a car was coming, he would turn on the lights early because the car was running fast; if it was a large flatbed truck, the speed was slow, so he would turn on the lights later, so as not to affect the passage of people and vehicles. Public buses have certain driving rules and times, and most of the passengers are workers, students, and government staff, and time cannot be delayed, so they should open the road for them as soon as possible. As a result, the traffic order in the district has been greatly improved. Under his leadership, the team created a new record of no accidents for eleven months.
    Lu Guohong loves the job the Party has given him more and more. He believes: "The most valuable asset in building socialism is people, and our task is to protect the traffic safety of pedestrians; what an important responsibility the motherland has given us!" What some people consider to be "ordinary" and "meaningless" work, Lu Guohong treats it as an extraordinary thing to do. In winter, when heavy snow blocked the road, he took the lead in clearing the snow. When there were not enough tools, he moved large ice blocks with his hands. When his hands were frozen and sore, he rubbed them and continued to work. Sometimes he worked until late at night. On rainy days, when there was water on the streets, making it inconvenient for pedestrians to walk, he disregarded his already broken toes and automatically went to unblock the sewers. His toes were soaked in dirty water and felt like being pricked by needles, but he still insisted on clearing the sewers until the accumulated water receded and pedestrians could walk without obstacles, and then he left with satisfaction. It was in these "ordinary" and "small" things that Lu Guohong gradually developed noble communist moral qualities. On January 17th of this year, he performed another heroic act of self-sacrifice. He was on duty at the Jianye Road booth when a small jeep was signaling to turn from north to east. Suddenly, an old man crossed the street. He immediately shouted to stop, but the old man did not hear and continued to walk forward. Seeing that the car was about to reach him, Lu Guohong immediately rushed down from the booth and hurriedly gestured for an emergency stop towards the car. The car braked suddenly, stopping about two feet in front of him, saving the old man.
    Lu Guohong and all his comrades are not proud and complacent because of their achievements. They cautiously carry out the glorious task entrusted to them by the Party, and loyally protect the safety of thousands of pedestrians.

    一个优秀的交通警察
    雷远隆
    一九五四年冬天，西北风呼啸地向人们施展着威力，南京市平常很热闹的会堂一带，变得很宁静，行人也很稀少了，只有指挥交通的岗亭上，不时传出指挥车辆的清脆的铃声。
    一辆汽车飞快地由南向北驶来，距离淮海路和中山南路交叉口不远的时候，铃声响了，东西两面的红灯亮了。但这时一个老太太带着三个小孩，正要横穿过大街。一位交通警察用话筒大声呼喊：
      “老太太，站住！汽车来了！”
    老太太反而加快了脚步，带着两个小孩，横穿过了大街，丢下一个四、五岁的小孩还在街这边，也拔腿跑过来。这时，汽车离小孩已经很近，眼看着这孩子就有生命危险，老太太两眼直发呆。就在这千钧一发的时候，那位交通警察飞奔过来，用双手拦住孩子，孩子一跌，撞在他怀里。汽车呼地一声，刚巧从他的身后擦过去。
    这位交通警察，就是最近受到青年团江苏省委员会奖状表扬的青年团员、南京市公安局交通警察警长陆国洪同志。他在维护人民交通安全工作中，一贯出色地完成任务。他和全班同志一起创造了十一个“交通安全月”的优异成绩，在南京市公安局第二届功臣模范大会上，被评为一等模范。
    陆国洪早在一九五○年就走上了党分配给他的交通警察岗位。那时候，祖国刚从解放前的苦难日子中走过来，交通警察的物质装备还很缺乏，但这并不能降低他为人民服务的信心。夏天，他经常被太阳晒得头昏，被雨淋得全身透湿，但仍然聚精会神地坚持着；冬天的夜晚，寒冷和疲劳同时袭来，他努力把眼睛睁圆，克制着自己。慢慢地，他从努力工作中理解了党所教导的交通警察的工作意义：交通警察的工作同人民的生命、幸福密切联系着。他感到：一刻没有交通警察，就可能发生撞车、伤人事故，对国家、人民都不利。这种对革命事业的自豪感和光荣感，支持着他，使他精神愉快地度过了一个又一个的寒冬不眠之夜，晒过了许多伏夏烈日。他坚强地遵守着自己的诺言：不管怎样艰苦，一定要坚守这光荣的岗位。
    随着国家大规模的经济建设的进展，街上的车子一天比一天地多起来了。摆在每一个交通警察面前的任务，就是要更好地做好社会主义建设中的交通安全保卫工作。陆国洪更加积极了。每当他看见一辆又一辆载着器材、原料、产品的汽车，从他面前飞奔过去的时候，他高兴极了。他意识到自己也投身加入了这一前人未做过的、英勇的豪迈的事业。“这些车辆，都是为了支援社会主义建设，把物资送到工厂、矿山、农村去的，是在为人民未来的更大幸福而奔跑着，让车子跑得越安全、越迅速，社会主义不是来得越快吗？”陆国洪经常这样想着，并且鞭策自己：“要使支援社会主义建设的车子跑得既快又安全，我们的担子更加重了，更需要我们努力了！”
    正是街上交通流量一天比一天增大的时候，南京市公安局又向交通警察们提出了创造“交通安全年、安全班”的号召。这时陆国洪已被提升为警长。他和全班同志积极地以实际行动来响应上级号召。他们懂得：要创造“安全月”，光有信心和决心是不够的，必须提高业务水平。于是，他们就加强了业务研究，从工作中找到了交通变化情况的客观规律，改进了工作。在星期天，交通流量最大的时候，就重点加强警力，特别是在几个公共汽车站的附近，密切注意穿街的行人；在平常的日子，当放学、下班和电影散场的时候，他就站在交叉路口，加强喊话。防止车辆违章行驶。在巡逻方面，过去是没有重点地来回跑，车马行人多的地方往往照顾不过来，以后就改成重点巡逻的办法。在岗亭指挥方面，如果小汽车来了，就早开灯，因为小汽车跑得快；如果是大板车，速度慢，就晚开灯，以免影响人车穿行。公共汽车有一定的行驶规律和时间，乘客大都是工人、学生、机关工作人员，时间也不能耽误，就要及早为它们打开道路。这样一来，管区内的交通秩序有很大改进。在他带动下，创造了全班十一个月没出事故的新纪录。
    陆国洪越来越热爱党所交给他的工作岗位。他认为：“建设社会主义最宝贵的财产是人，而我们的任务是保护行人的交通安全；祖国交给我们多么重要的责任啊！”在一些人看来是“平凡”、“没意义”的工作，但陆国洪却把它当作不平凡的事来做。冬天，大雪阻路，他带头扫雪。工具不够，他就用手搬大冰块，手冻痛了，揉一揉再干。有时一直干到深夜。雨天，街上积水，行人走路不方便，他不顾自己的脚趾已经破裂，自动去通阴沟，脚趾被脏水泡得像针刺般痛，他仍然坚持把阴沟疏通，到积水退光，行人走路没有障碍，才满意地走开。就在这些被人视为“平凡”、“细小”的事情的不断锻炼中，陆国洪逐渐具备了高贵的共产主义道德品质。今年一月十七日，他又做出了一件舍己为人的英雄行为。他在建邺路岗亭值勤，一辆小吉普车正打手势由北向东迂回，忽然有一老人过街，他即高喊站住，老人没有听见，继续往前走，眼看汽车已到跟前，陆国洪马上冲下岗亭，迎着汽车连忙打急煞车手势，汽车猛然煞住，停在他面前两尺左右的地方，救了这位老人。
    陆国洪和他的全班同志并不因为他们的成就而骄傲自满，他们谨慎地执行着党交给他们的光荣任务，忠诚地保卫着千千万万行人的安全。
