Column:

We are meeting here, and this meeting could have been held earlier. In any case, starting these negotiations here and now to discuss the issues we have raised should not be considered untimely. However, since we are meeting for the first time, we should of course be particularly concerned with understanding each other, frankly expressing our thoughts and feelings, and striving to find possibilities that truly conform to the interests of the Soviet people and also truly conform to the interests of the German people, bringing us closer together.

In this situation, I would like to say a few words not as a Foreign Minister, but as an ordinary Soviet citizen. Here I can immediately say that I wholeheartedly agree with what Comrade Khrushchev just said.

Some people compare the crimes of the Hitlerite occupiers who occupied our territory with the actions of the Soviet army, which gloriously defended the motherland during the Great Patriotic War. We Soviet people cannot ignore such words. In order to defend against the aggressors, the Soviet army had to take some military measures during the course of military operations that it had no choice but to take. It is very clear that these military measures taken by the Soviet army on German territory cannot be compared with the crimes of the aggressors on Soviet territory. This is an insult to the Soviet people. I hope that we can find common ground on this issue in this negotiation.

Now it should be mentioned that in 1945, when the Soviet army entered German territory in the course of military operations, their actions were generally the same as those of the American and British armies. Of course, there were differences between the Soviet army and other Allied forces, because the Soviet army was at the forefront and took the responsibility for overcoming the main difficulties in the war. This was because, for nearly four years before that, the war was fought on our Soviet territory, and the Soviet army acted with due speed and determination, accelerating the end of the war.

It is appropriate to say that the Soviet army was not only fighting for its own motherland, but also for the German people.

The Federal Chancellor told us that Hitler and Hitlerism should not be equated with the German people. We completely agree with this statement. We clearly remember what Comrade J.V. Stalin said as early as the beginning of 1942: Hitler and his ilk will come and go, but the German nation, the German state, will still exist. This sentence expresses the profound thought of the entire Soviet people.

If Hitler's army had not invaded the Soviet Union, would the German people have suffered so much? Is it not a fact that the German people themselves were unable to liberate themselves from Hitler and Hitlerism? If the German people had been able to liberate themselves from Hitler and Hitlerism before the outbreak of World War II, wouldn't the Soviet people have been happier than anyone else? But at that time, the German people were unable to do so.

The Federal Chancellor said to me yesterday that he had never seen Hitler, and if he had seen Hitler in the past, he would have strangled Hitler with his own hands. Of course, we understand Mr. Adenauer's feelings. Then you will also understand us Soviet people, and understand the significance of the historic undertaking completed by our army—that is: our Soviet army liberated the German people from Fascism and Hitlerism.

I have no doubt that Mr. Adenauer, when mentioning the military operations of our army that entered German territory at the end of the war, did not intend to say anything insulting. We have the right to say that the Soviet army entered Germany as the liberator of the Soviet people and also as the liberator of the German people, making great sacrifices.

You know very well that our people also bore no small sacrifices in order to liberate the people of other European countries.

Now I want to talk about the issues we are discussing.

What does the Soviet government propose? The Soviet government has proposed in the past and now proposes the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. Comrade Bulganin, the head of the Soviet delegation, and Comrade Khrushchev, both spoke clearly and affirmatively about this yesterday and today. This will become a good foundation for the development of economic and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. We know that the Federal Republic of Germany agrees that our negotiations should discuss these issues and other issues related to them.

The head of the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany suggested that we should also discuss the issue of a group of former prisoners of war who were sentenced by Soviet courts for particularly serious crimes during the war, that is, in fact, the issue of a group of war criminals. And the second issue suggested for discussion is the issue of restoring German unity.

The Prime Minister said here today that he did not mention the word "prisoners of war" in his speech yesterday, which is completely correct. Nor did he mention the word "war criminals." This is also correct. So who are we talking about now? Where exactly is the issue raised by the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany? We have here several thousand sentenced war criminals who have committed particularly brutal crimes against the Soviet people, against peace, and against all mankind. We have no one else here. Since this issue is raised to the Soviet government, it refers to them.

The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany said that they understand the Soviet people's mood of boundless anger and hatred for the crimes and atrocities committed by the aggressors and war criminals against the Soviet people. We are pleased with this opinion.

We do not believe that all German people regard this issue, that is, how to deal with the above-mentioned extremely heinous war criminals, as the fundamental or primary issue in resolving the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. However, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that this issue, that is, the issue of war criminals, is related to both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. And if you agree to discuss this issue with representatives of the German Democratic Republic, that can also be done. However, we believe that the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany may not consider this appropriate under the current conditions. We have to take this into account.

There is another issue—the issue of restoring German unity. We Soviet people are very clear about how important this issue is to the German people.

In this regard, we cannot but explain that serious difficulties have now been created on this issue due to the implementation of the Paris Accords. The Soviet Union has repeatedly stated and warned at the time that the conclusion of such an agreement would never be in the interest of restoring German unity, and it will become an obstacle that did not exist not long ago, and could have been avoided. Not only the Soviet people, but also many Germans and people of other countries are very clear that West Germany's participation in military blocs aimed at the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe, and the realization of West Germany's re-militarization, are not ways to promote the restoration of German unity.

Please allow me to express the hope that the majority of the German people will understand this before too long. Now, we are in a period of relaxation of international tensions, and this fact helps to make such a speculation.

I would also like to say that if the Germans themselves do not unite their forces and do not start to solve the problem of German unification, this problem cannot be solved correctly. It has been said in the past that the four major powers also have obligations in this matter. This is right. The Soviet Union and the Soviet government are very clear about this. However, the restoration of German unity is, first and foremost, a matter for the Germans themselves. If the Germans do not find a common foundation on this matter, it will be impossible to overcome the existing difficulties.

You have said here that the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany does not propose any "preconditions." Our understanding of this sentence is that the Federal Republic of Germany does not propose any preconditions for establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. We welcome this clear statement from the Federal Chancellor. In this regard, we also welcome today's speech by Mr. Brentano, the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, who also took a negative attitude towards the so-called "preconditions." However, the Federal Chancellor's speech yesterday said that the issues raised in the Soviet government's proposal and the issues raised in the Federal Chancellor's speech must be resolved "as a whole." It is difficult to say that this statement is not a "precondition."

Should this sentence be understood as: diplomatic relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union cannot be established until the war criminal issue and the restoration of German unity issue are resolved?

If we expect to solve three, four, or more issues, each with its own significance, in one fell swoop, then we need to ask: Is doing so in line with the interests of the Soviet and German people, or will doing so run counter to the interests of the German and Soviet people?

We feel that we will get better results by solving these problems one by one. If we postpone one problem until the rest are solved, that is actually delaying the solution of each of them.

We believe that establishing diplomatic relations in the current situation is in the interest of the Soviet Union, and it is also in the same degree in the interest of the Federal Republic of Germany. If the government of the Federal Republic of Germany considers it appropriate to resolve this issue, then we can resolve this issue today. Doing so will make it possible for us to further improve relations and consider all other issues. Delaying the resolution of the issue of establishing normal relations and all attempts to resolve this issue incompletely will not achieve the goal and are completely inappropriate.

I think that if we had met five years ago, the situation would have been better than it is today, ten years after the end of the war. However, even now, of course, it is possible to act in various ways.

The Soviet government decided to take the initiative in the meeting between the representatives of the two countries. We believe that the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany is also able to understand this correctly. However, I still agree with an opinion I just heard, that is, if the Federal Republic of Germany considers it necessary to postpone the issues currently under discussion for a while, then that is fine.

I would also like to talk about the significance of the recent Geneva Four-Power Summit for the issues we are currently discussing. There is no doubt that this meeting is a good prerequisite for improving relations between our two countries and resolving the German issue.

The whole world believes that the Geneva Conference is a new stage in the four-power relationship that is in line with the interests of consolidating peace and improving relations between countries. However, in some newspapers in West Germany, and not only in West Germany, we can still see comments that insist that the Geneva Conference produced some unfavorable results for the Federal Republic of Germany and the German people. We cannot agree with this view. Only those who do not want to ease international relations but want to develop the situation in the opposite direction hold such a view.

The improvement in the four-power relationship that we can now see has created a better situation for resolving the unresolved issues after the war. This is conducive to the smooth resolution of the German issue.

The very fact that the talks are being held now shows the beginning of an improvement in relations between our two countries. This meeting should help ease international tensions. All of this is in the interest of the Soviet people and the German people. (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, according to TASS)

### 苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的发言

专栏：

    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的发言
    我们在这里开会了，这次会议本来还可以早一些举行。无论如何，在此时此地开始进行这一谈判，来讨论我们所提出的那些问题，绝不能认为时机不够成熟。但是，我们既然是初次会见，当然，我们就应该特别关心使彼此互相了解，坦率地说出我们的想法和我们的感觉，并且应该努力寻求既真正符合苏联人民的利益、也真正符合德国人民利益的那些使我们接近的可能性。
    在这种情况下，我想与其作为外交部长，不如作为一个普通的苏联人讲几句话。这里我可以马上说，我对赫鲁晓夫同志刚才所说的话是万分同意的。
    有人把占领我们领土的希特勒占领者的罪行同在伟大卫国战争期间光荣地保卫祖国的苏联军队的行动相提并论，我们苏联人对这种话是不能置之不理的。为了防御侵略者，苏联军队在军事行动过程中不得不采取一些非采取不行的军事措施。十分清楚，苏军在德国领土上所采取的这些军事措施是不能同侵略者在苏联领土上的罪行相提并论的。这对苏联人民是一种侮辱。我希望，我们在这次谈判中能够在这个问题上找到共同的基础。
    现在应当提一提的是，在一九四五年，当苏军在军事行动进程中进入德国领土时，他们的行动一般说来是同美军和英军一样的。当然，苏联军队和其他盟军之间是有区别的，因为苏军走在前面，担当了克服战争中主要困难的责任。这是由于，在这之前的将近四年中，战争是在我们苏联的领土上进行的，苏军以应有的迅速和坚决精神行动，加速战争的结束。
    这样说是适宜的，就是：苏军不仅是为自己的祖国战斗，而且他们也是为德国人民战斗。
    联邦总理对我们说，不应该把希特勒和希特勒主义同德国人民等同起来。我们完全同意这种说法。我们很清楚地记住约·维·斯大林还在一九四二年初说过的这样的话：希特勒之流会上台也就会下台，而德意志民族，德意志国家则依然是存在的。这句话表达了苏联全体人民的深刻的思想。
    如果希特勒军队没有侵犯苏联，德国人民也不至于受苦受难，这难道不是事实吗？德国人民自己不能够从希特勒和希特勒主义手中解放自己，这难道不是事实吗？如果还在第二次世界大战爆发以前德国人民就能够从希特勒和希特勒主义手中解放自己，苏联人民岂不是比任何人都高兴的吗？但是，那时德国人民没有能够办到这一点。
    联邦总理昨天对我说，他从来没有见过希特勒，如果他过去见到希特勒，那么一定亲手扼死希特勒。当然，我们是理解阿登纳先生的这种心情的。那么你们也会理解我们苏联人，会理解我国军队所完成的历史性事业的意义——这就是：我们苏联军队从法西斯主义和希特勒主义下解放了德国人民。
    我毫不怀疑，阿登纳先生提到在战争末期进入德国领土的我们的军队的军事行动时，是不愿意说什么侮辱话的。我们有权利说，苏军作为苏联人民的解放者，同时也作为德国人民的解放者进入德国，作了重大的牺牲。
    你们很清楚地知道，我们人民为了解放欧洲其他国家的人民，也承担了不小的牺牲。
    现在我要谈一谈我们所讨论的问题。
    苏联政府所建议的是什么呢？苏联政府在过去和现在都建议苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间建立正常的外交关系。苏联代表团团长布尔加宁同志在昨天，赫鲁晓夫同志在今天都清楚地和肯定地谈到这一点。这将成为苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间发展经济关系以及发展文化关系的良好基础。我们知道，德意志联邦共和国同意，我们的谈判应当讨论这些问题以及同这些事有关的其他问题。
    德意志联邦共和国代表团团长建议还要讨论关于一批由于在战争时期罪恶特别重大而被苏联法院判刑的前战俘的问题，这就是说，实际上是关于一批战犯的问题。而建议讨论的第二个问题是关于恢复德国统一的问题。
    总理先生今天在这里说，在他昨天的发言中并没有提到“战俘”这个字眼，这是完全不错的。也没有提到“战犯”这个字眼。这也是不错的。那我们现在谈的是谁呢？德意志联邦共和国代表团提出的问题究竟在那里呢？我们这里是有好几千被判刑的战犯，他们犯下了对苏联人民，对和平和全人类特别残暴的罪行。我们这里没有别的什么人。既然向苏联政府提出这一问题，那末指的就是他们。
    德意志联邦共和国总理和外交部长说，苏联人民无比愤怒地憎恨侵略者和战犯对苏联人所干的那些罪恶和暴行的心情，是他们所了解的。这种意见使我们感到满意。
    我们并不认为，所有德国人民都把这个问题，即如何对待上述罪大恶极的战犯的问题，看成解决苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的相互关系当中的基本的或者是首要的问题。但是，从另一方面看，不能不承认，这个问题，即关于战犯的问题，是同德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国都有关系的。并且，如果你们同意同德意志民主共和国的代表一起来讨论这个问题的话，那也是可以做到的。但是，我们认为，德意志联邦共和国代表团在目前条件下未必会认为这是适宜的。我们不得不考虑到这一点。
    还有另外一个问题——关于恢复德国统一的问题。我们苏联人十分清楚，这个问题对德国人民是何等重要。
    在这方面，我们不能不说明，现在，由于巴黎协定的实现，在这个问题上已经造成了严重的困难。苏联当时曾再三地声明过和警告过，缔结这种协定决不会符合恢复德国统一的利益，并且它将成为不久前还不存在的，而且本来是可以避免的一种障碍。不仅是苏联人，而且还有许多德国人以及其他国家的人们都十分清楚，西德参加矛头针对苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平的国家的军事集团以及西德重新军国主义化的实现，这并不是可以促成恢复德国统一的途径。
    请容许我表示希望：德国的大多数人民不要经过很长时间就会明白这一点。现在，我们是处在国际紧张局势缓和的时期中，这一事实是有助于作这种推测的。
    我还愿意说，如果德国人自己不团结起自己的力量和不着手解决统一德国的问题，这个问题是不可能获得正确的解决的。过去曾经说过：在这件事情上，四大国也负有义务。这是对的。苏联和苏联政府方面是很明白这一点的。然而，恢复德国的统一，究竟首先是德国人自己的事情。如果德国人不在这件事情上找到共同的基础，那就不可能克服现有的困难。
    你们在这里曾经讲过：德意志联邦共和国代表团不提出任何“先决条件”。我们对这句话的理解是：德意志联邦共和国在同苏联建立外交关系的问题上不提任何先决条件。我们欢迎联邦总理的这个明确的声明。在这方面，我们也欢迎德意志联邦共和国外交部长勃伦塔诺先生今天的发言，他也对所谓“先决条件”抱着否定的态度。但是，联邦总理昨天的发言说，必须要把苏联政府的建议中所提出的问题以及联邦总理的发言中所提出的问题“作为一个整体”来加以解决，这种提法恐怕很难说不是一种“先决条件”。
    对这句话是否应该这样理解：在战犯问题和恢复德国统一问题没有解决之前，德意志联邦共和国和苏联之间不能建立外交关系？
    如果我们期待一举解决三个、四个或者更多的各有各的意义的问题，那就需要问一下：这样做是否符合苏联和德国人民的利益，或是相反地这样做将同德国和苏联人民的利益相抵触呢？
    我们觉得，一个个地来解决这些问题，会获得更好的结果。要是把一个问题拖延到其余问题都解决时才解决，那其实就是拖延了其中每一个问题的解决。
    我们认为，在目前情况下建立外交关系是符合苏联的利益的，而且也是在同样程度上符合德意志联邦共和国的利益的。如果德意志联邦共和国政府认为解决这个问题是适宜的话，那末我们今天就能够解决这个问题。这样做会使我们有可能进一步改善关系和考虑所有的其他问题。拖延建立正常关系这个问题的解决和想不彻底地解决这个问题的各种企图是不能达到目的的，并且是完全不合时宜的。
    我觉得，我们要是在五年前会晤，局势就会比战争结束十年后的今天要良好。然而，就是在现在，当然也是能够以各种方式行动的。
    苏联政府决定在两国代表会晤这件事情上采取主动。我们以为，德意志联邦共和国代表团也是能够正确地了解这一点的。然而，我仍然同意我刚才听到的一种意见，就是如果德意志联邦共和国认为有必要把目前讨论中的问题延缓一些时候再解决，那就这样办好了。
    我愿意还谈一下，不久前举行的日内瓦四国政府首脑会议对我们现在所讨论的问题具有怎样的意义。毫无疑问，这次会议是改善我们两国关系和解决德国问题的良好前提。
    全世界都认为，日内瓦会议是符合巩固和平和改善国与国之间关系的利益的四国关系中的新阶段。然而，在西德某些报纸和不仅是西德的一些其他报纸上还可以看到这样的言论：硬说日内瓦会议对德意志联邦共和国和德国人民产生某些不利的结果。我们不能同意这种看法。只有那些不想使国际关系缓和而要使局势朝着相反方向发展的人才抱这样的看法。
    我们现在已经可以看到的四国关系中的改善，对解决战后悬而未决的问题创造了更加良好的情况。这从而也就有利于德国问题的顺利解决。
    目前举行会谈这件事情的本身就表明了我们两国关系改善的开始。这次会谈应有助于国际紧张局势的和缓。所有这一切都是符合苏联人民和德国人民的利益的。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科电）
