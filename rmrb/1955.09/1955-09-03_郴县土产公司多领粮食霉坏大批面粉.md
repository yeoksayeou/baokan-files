To the Editor:

The Chen County Branch of the China Native Produce Company violated national grain policies by repeatedly receiving flour, resulting in a large accumulation of flour and serious spoilage.

At the end of last year, the Chen County Special Office, based on the company's business situation, decided to allocate 120,000 jin of flour to them from December of last year to June of this year. However, the company privately requested an additional 90,000 jin of flour from the Hunan Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company. After this flour was transported, there was no place to store it, so they had to rent a warehouse at the Chen County Joint Transportation Station for temporary storage. Later, when the flour was transported back to the company's warehouse, it was placed directly on the damp floor without any padding or stacking, mixed with sugar. The sugar absorbed moisture, melted, and soaked the flour. However, no one paid attention to this situation. During the rainy season, the flour became even more difficult to store, yet the company did not notify the local grain department to make appropriate allocations. Instead, on May 23rd and June 20th, they submitted plans requesting the supply of flour, repeatedly stating that "the company does not have a single bag of flour left in stock." It was only at this point that someone discovered that more than 500 bags (over 25,000 jin) of flour in the warehouse had already become moldy and deteriorated, solidifying into lumps, and some had been eaten by termites.

What to do? They hired people to loosen the 256 bags of the most severely deteriorated flour with their feet, attempting to deceive superiors during inspections. They then moved the 246 bags of relatively better flour to the processing factory to be processed quickly. Due to the limited capacity of the processing factory and problems with market sales, the already processed steamed buns and flatbreads could not be sold due to their poor quality. Currently, the company's processing factory warehouse is still filled with deteriorated flour, some of which has completely turned yellow-green and has a strong odor. I heard that the company's leading staff members are going to Guangzhou to print packaging paper for "Cocoa Candy," preparing to use the moldy, smelly flour to make "Cocoa Candy" to deceive consumers and sell it.

I believe that the relevant leading departments should inspect and deal with the company's wrong behavior. At the same time, this matter should serve as a lesson for the relevant grain supply departments.

### 郴县土产公司多领粮食霉坏大批面粉

    郴县土产公司多领粮食霉坏大批面粉编辑同志：
    中国土产公司郴县分公司违反国家粮食政策，重复领取面粉，造成大批面粉积压和发霉变质的严重事件。
    去年年底，郴县专署根据这个公司的营业情况，决定从去年十二月到今年六月共拨给他们十二万斤面粉，但是这个公司又私自向中国土产公司湖南省公司再要来九万斤面粉。这些面粉运来以后，连堆放的地方也没有，只好租用郴县联运站的仓库暂时存放。后来面粉运回到公司的仓库，既不垫脚，又不砌垛，就放在潮湿的地板上，同食糖混在一起。食糖受了潮，溶化了，就浸潮了面粉。但是，这种情况一直没人过问。到了黄霉季节，面粉更不容易保管了，这个公司还不通知当地粮食部门适当进行调拨，反而在五月二十三日和六月二十日又提出要求供应面粉的计划，并一再声明“公司里一包存粉也没有了”。正在这个时候，才有人发现仓库里的五百多包（二万五千多斤）面粉已经发霉变质，凝固成块，有的已经被白蚁吃了。
    怎么办呢？他们雇人把二百五十六包变质最严重的面粉用脚踩松，企图来混过上级的检查，另外把较好的二百四十六包搬到加工厂赶紧加工。由于加工厂的力量有限，市场销售量更成问题，而已经加工的包干和发饼也因为质量低劣而卖不出去。到现在这个公司加工厂的仓库还塞满了变质的面粉，有的已经完全变成黄绿色，臭味很大了。听说公司的领导工作人员正在去广州印“可可糖”的包装纸，准备把霉臭的面粉做“可可糖”来蒙混消费者，推销出去。
    我认为：有关领导部门应该对这个公司的错误行为进行检查并处理；同时，这件事也值得有关的粮食供应部门引以为教训。
