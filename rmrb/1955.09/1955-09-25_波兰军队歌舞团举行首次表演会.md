Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: The Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble held its first song and dance performance at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing on the 24th, presenting fifteen beautiful musical and dance programs. These rich and varied programs included mass songs, military songs, and folk songs from Poland, China, and the Soviet Union, Polish and Chinese folk dances, dances depicting the life of the Polish army, and orchestral performances. The grand occasion of the evening was simultaneously broadcast by Beijing People's Broadcasting Station.

The song and dance performance began with the grand chorus of nearly a hundred members of the song and dance ensemble singing the national anthems of China and Poland. Following this, the song and dance ensemble performed the "Polonaise Dance" according to Polish custom as a prelude to the evening. This ancient Polish folk dance was composed by the famous Polish musician Chopin. Forty male and female dancers dressed in brightly colored ethnic costumes and Polish military uniforms, holding bouquets of flowers, formed different magnificent patterns on the stage as they stepped to the slow and solemn dance steps.

The grand chorus performed by Polish singers was warmly welcomed by the audience tonight. A total of seventeen Polish and other national songs were sung in the five chorus programs. The chorus demonstrated a high degree of artistic accomplishment in singing these songs with different styles. The song "Reed Flute," performed in the first chorus program, had a beautiful melody, with singing and beautiful whistling sounds alternating. When the Chinese song "Long Live Chairman Mao" ended, thunderous applause and cheers erupted in the theater. Both songs were encored after prolonged applause from the audience. After the chorus sang two a cappella songs, the humorous a cappella song "Marusya, Don't Go to the Forest!" which was added as an encore, was also repeated.

The dancers of the song and dance ensemble performed a total of five beautiful Polish folk dances tonight. The "Krakowiak Dance," which was re-performed for the audience, is an extremely popular dance in Poland. It is based on the theme of the Polish people celebrating their victory after defeating the Tartars in the fifteenth century, expressing the indomitable spirit of the Polish people and the victorious confidence and joy of free people.

The last two programs of the evening were the "Polonaise Dance" and the "Mazurka Dance," composed by the famous Polish musician Moniuszko, and performed with accompaniment by the grand chorus. The former dance was slow and solemn, while the latter dance was fast and intense. The performers demonstrated a high level of collective skill in the dances. The song and dance ensemble's performance of the "Sailor Dance," which depicts the life of the Polish army, and the Chinese folk dance "Picking Tea and Chasing Butterflies," also achieved great success.

An opening ceremony was held before the performance. When all the members of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble appeared on the stage, thunderous applause resounded in the theater hall. Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Xia Yan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, Ma Sicong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, Wu Xiaobang, Chairman of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association, and others stepped onto the stage with flowers, representing Chinese literary and art circles and military literary and art workers to welcome the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble's performance in China. In his welcoming speech, Chen Yi thanked them for bringing the beautiful art of the Polish people and congratulated them on the success of the performance. Lieutenant Colonel Wolva delivered a reply on behalf of the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble. Afterwards, Chen Yi and others warmly embraced Lieutenant Colonel Wolva and others.

After the performance, more than 250 literary and art workers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army presented flowers to the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble. Cheers and applause rang out from both on and off the stage. Subsequently, Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long and Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Su Yu, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wu Yuzhang, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xiao Hua, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China Qian Junrui, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Chen Yi, and Polish Ambassador to China Kirilo visited the backstage together to express their congratulations and condolences to the members of the song and dance ensemble.

    波兰军队歌舞团举行首次表演会
    新华社二十四日讯　波兰军队歌舞团二十四日在北京天桥剧场举行首次歌舞表演会，演出了十五个优美的音乐舞蹈节目。这些丰富多采的节目中，有波兰、中国和苏联的群众歌曲、部队歌曲和民歌，有波兰和中国的民间舞蹈，有表现波兰军队生活的舞蹈，还有交响乐队的演奏。晚会的盛况同时由北京人民广播电台广播。
    歌舞晚会表演由歌舞团的近百人组成的大合唱队合唱中、波两国国歌开始。接着，歌舞团按照波兰的习俗表演了作为晚会前奏的“波洛乃兹舞”。这个古老的波兰民间舞蹈是由波兰著名音乐家萧邦作曲。四十位穿着鲜艳的各色民族服装和波兰军服的男女舞蹈家，举着花束，踏着徐缓而庄重的舞步，在舞台上组成了不同的瑰丽的图案。
    波兰歌唱家表演的大合唱今晚受到观众的热烈欢迎。在五个合唱节目中一共演唱了十七支波兰和其他国家的歌曲。合唱队在演唱这些具有不同风格的歌曲时表现了高度的艺术素养。在第一个合唱节目中演唱的歌曲“芦笛”，它的曲调优美，歌声和美妙的口哨声轮替。中国歌曲“万岁毛泽东”演唱结束时，剧场中发出了雷动的掌声和欢呼声。这两支歌都在观众长时间鼓掌后重唱了一次。合唱队演唱了两支无伴奏合唱歌曲以后，加唱的一支无伴奏的幽默歌曲“玛露霞，不要到森林去！”也重唱了一次。
    歌舞团的舞蹈家们今晚一共演出了五个优美的波兰民间舞。为观众重演了一次的“克拉科维亚克舞”，是一个在波兰极为流行的舞蹈，它以十五世纪波兰人民打败鞑靼人后欢庆胜利为题材，表现了波兰人民英雄不屈，表现了自由人民的胜利信心和欢乐。
    晚会上最后的两个节目是波兰著名音乐家莫纽什科作曲的“波洛乃兹舞”和“玛佐卡舞”，由大合唱队伴唱演出。前一个舞蹈徐缓庄重，后一个舞蹈急促强烈。表演者在舞蹈中表现了高度的集体技巧。歌舞团演出的表现波兰军队生活的“水兵舞”和中国民间舞“采茶扑蝶”，也获得了极大的成功。
    在演出前举行了开幕式。波兰军队歌舞团全体人员出现在舞台时，剧场大厅中响起了雷动的掌声。中国人民解放军总政治部文化部部长陈沂、中华人民共和国文化部副部长夏衍、中国音乐家协会副主席马思聪、中国舞蹈艺术研究会主席吴晓邦等携着鲜花登上舞台，代表中国文艺界和部队文艺工作者欢迎波兰军队歌舞团在中国演出。陈沂在欢迎词中感谢他们带来了波兰人民优美的艺术，并且祝贺演出成功。沃尔瓦中校代表波兰军队歌舞团致了答词。接着，陈沂等和沃尔瓦中校等热烈拥抱。
    在演出结束后，中国人民解放军的文艺工作者二百五十多人向波兰军队歌舞团献了花。台上台下一齐欢呼鼓掌。随后，国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深，中国人民解放军总参谋长粟裕，全国人民代表大会常务委员吴玉章，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华，中华人民共和国文化部代理部长钱俊瑞，中国人民解放军总政治部文化部部长陈沂，同波兰驻华大使基里洛克一同到后台向歌舞团人员表示祝贺和慰问。（附图片）
