Efforts to Complete and Exceed the 1955 Plan

    Let the Campaign for Increased Production and Economy Reach the Broad Masses of Workers
    Gan Bai, Deputy Director of the Third Machine Industry Bureau, First Ministry of Machine Building
    The campaign for increased production and economy in the five factories in the Northeast region under the Third Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building has gone through processes such as ideological criticism, mobilizing the masses, exposing waste, issuing targets, and formulating measures. However, as of now, only a few factories, such as the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, have done a relatively good job, with specific struggle goals and methods for completing tasks, and the enthusiasm of the workers is high. The situation in most factories is not good, with increased production and economy targets remaining in the hands of workshop and work section leaders for a long time, and the broad masses of workers are watching, waiting, and lack motivation.
    Why is the campaign for increased production and economy not progressing well in most factories? This is mainly due to shortcomings and deviations in the leadership work of certain leading staff. These are manifested in the following five aspects:
    1.  Incomplete understanding of the campaign for increased production and economy, viewing increased production and economy in isolation. For example, some workshops in the Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Plant have not yet clarified what the production tasks are for this year and where the key to completing the production tasks lies, but are discussing how to save workshop expenses and conserve consumable materials in isolation. Some factories, because they did not complete their tasks in the first half of the year and fell too far behind, do not hesitate to complete the tasks by borrowing and hiring a large number of workers and outsourcing the processing of parts in order to complete the annual tasks, but do not pay enough attention to how to tap the potential of their own enterprises and whether product costs will increase as a result. Some factories are very enthusiastic about mobilizing workers to use their spare time to dig and collect scrap iron in the factory and are very serious about saving office expenses (which, of course, are necessary), but they are not very concerned about the most important savings—strengthening management, reducing the scrap rate, and saving raw materials. The leading staff of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant once attempted to make up for the shortfall in the completion of products such as machines by increasing the production of steel ingots, in order to complete the factory's annual total output value and total commodity value, but did not pay attention to the variety plan of machine products (equipment supplied to key construction projects) and large forgings and castings for fraternal factories. The mechanical installation team of this factory, in order to save the gauze and oil for wiping machines, even allowed the use of oil with sediment to wipe the machines! Although the director of the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant assigned the task of increasing production and economy to the lower levels and expressed his determination to complete the task, the total output value only reached 66.1% of the plan and the total commodity value only reached 32.5% of the plan because he did not specifically supervise and inspect the production tasks for the month.
    2.  The masses have not been fully mobilized. Obvious waste phenomena have not been deeply hated by the masses, and many workers still have incorrect understandings of the campaign for increased production and economy. Some people say, "Increased production and economy is a gust of wind, coming once a year," "There are so many problems, how can we increase production and economy?" "It's useless to make suggestions if the leadership doesn't solve the problems." Some workshops in the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant said that returning the light bulbs and materials that were fraudulently claimed was saving. Some bridge crane drivers in some workshops often use ten-ton or twenty-ton cranes to transport lunch boxes and popsicles weighing less than one kilogram, and were not stopped by workshop staff and the masses. The Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Plant abandoned special equipment manufactured with 10,000 to 20,000 yuan of technical improvement funds after only minor problems; more than 50 cast steel wheels for sixty-ton tippers were all scrapped. The Dalian Crane Factory used to use three tons more steel plates for each crane, and treated the cut-off large pieces of material as scrap iron. Some workers demanded to overcome this waste, but the relevant technical departments ignored it. This situation did not change until recently after newspaper criticism and inspection by higher-level authorities. These phenomena show that if the political consciousness of the workers is not raised, and strict economy and opposition to waste do not become the center of public opinion among the masses, it will be impossible to completely stop waste.
    3.  Lack of comprehensive understanding of the actual situation, and failure to formulate correct norms. Many factories usually do not pay attention to accumulating technical and economic norm data, and do not go deep into the lower levels to investigate the situation during the campaign. Therefore, the increased production and economy targets issued are not practical. Workshops and work sections doubt the reliability of the targets, and bargain with each other from top to bottom. The tasks cannot be issued in a timely manner, and the masses wait without moving forward. Many factories lack strict control over materials and finished products. For example, in the cast iron workshop of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, although savings targets were stipulated, the coke used every day was not weighed; the forging workshop could freely select forged steel ingots; the large forgings made in the cast steel workshop were not weighed or counted. The norm section originally "calculated" the weight of the electric shovel column to be eleven tons, but the electric shovel column after pouring could not be lifted by a fifteen-ton crane; the norm section "calculated" the pressing box crossbeam to be eleven tons, while the workshop estimated it to be only more than three tons. Each workshop in this factory stipulates targets for saving heating and water, but there are no meters to measure the consumption of heating and water. The production and sales volume of steel ingots are all estimated, so it often happens at the end of the quarter or year that there is a surplus of thousands of tons or a deficit of thousands of tons... Under these circumstances, how can correct planning and strict economic accounting be carried out?
    4.  The measures for implementing the plan are empty, unrealistic, and cannot be checked. Some factories list the measures of each section (which are thought out by one person without discussion by the masses) without analysis as the measures of the whole factory. Some of them are just slogans, such as "Implement the suggestions of Soviet experts," "Promote advanced experience," and "Improve quality and reduce the scrap rate." Many of the measures in a workshop of the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant do not specify who is responsible for implementing them and when they will be completed, so there is no guarantee that these measures will be implemented. In the measures stipulated in many factories, no measures for improving enterprise management are stipulated based on the specific tasks and specific characteristics of the unit.
    5.  Many factories have not organized labor competitions and formulated appropriate reward and punishment methods, so the enthusiasm of the masses has not been fully mobilized, and the labor enthusiasm cannot be consolidated. The wage policy of some factories is not implemented reasonably. The workers' skills have improved, but they have not been promoted for three or four years; workers with high skills are assigned to do work with low technical levels. Although they have reached the quota, they cannot get their basic wages for several months. Workers in the three-shift system jointly process a job, and wages are not distributed according to the amount of work, but according to the length of working time. Many factories do not reward excellent workers, nor do they give due disciplinary sanctions to those who violate labor discipline. This situation seriously hinders the development of increased production and economy.
    The main reason for the above shortcomings and deviations is that the leading staff at all levels of the enterprise lack a comprehensive and lasting understanding of increased production and economy, lack specific leadership in economic work, and have no clear view of relying on the workers to do a good job in production.
    According to the experience of factories that have done a good job, to correctly carry out the campaign for increased production and economy, it is necessary to implement the principle of "overall planning and mastering key points," mobilizing the masses at all levels to expose losses and waste, starting from the specific situation of the enterprise, studying the main links and key points of increased production and economy for completing the national plan at all levels, issuing and determining various indicators at all levels, and formulating specific technical and organizational measures plans. Each section and office, under unified leadership, should check and help each workshop according to the business system to comprehensively implement the plan.
    Increased production and economy is a regular and long-term task. It must never be regarded as a short-term blitz campaign; increased production and economy are unified and mutually influential, and must never be arranged in isolation and unilaterally. At the same time, we must not only strive to complete this year's tasks, but also prepare for next year's production, because next year's tasks are heavy, and under certain conditions, the tasks of the first and second quarters of next year can be advanced to this year's production. The focus of increased production and economy measures should be on how to strengthen production management, improve planning, organization technology, and economic work. Therefore, each factory must first formulate and arrange plans, rectify the organization, adjust cadres, and the director and deputy director should separately grasp various businesses under a unified policy and plan to improve the management level of the enterprise.
    It is necessary to actively sort out various norm data. To this end, section staff should go deep into workshops and actual work to investigate and propose draft economic and technical indicators of various categories for each section, office, and workshop. After the draft is discussed and revised by the workers, it must be completed. Units that cannot temporarily propose reliable raw material consumption norm indicators can propose temporary indicators through discussion by the workers, accumulate data within a limited time, and then formally stipulate the indicators. Once the indicators are stipulated, it is necessary to control materials according to the indicators and issue materials within the quota. Each workshop and warehouse should add necessary measuring instruments, such as electric meters, water meters, gas meters, and scales, for measurement in order to assess and compare results.
    The measures for increased production and economy should be clear and specific, address the root cause, be mutually consistent, have specific items and work content, deadlines, executors, and inspectors. Once the measures are approved, it is necessary to organize all forces to implement them.
    Each factory should strengthen political work, mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, and vigorously support the rationalization proposals of the masses. Section staff should effectively help the workshops solve difficulties in their work and provide the workshops with favorable conditions. It is necessary to stipulate various necessary reward and punishment systems, strictly enforce labor discipline, and implement the piece-rate wage system and the time-based bonus system to closely combine the interests of the state with the interests of the workers. It is necessary to resolutely eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries to clear obstacles for increased production and economy to ensure the smooth completion of the national plan.

### 让增产节约工作深入到广大职工中去

    让增产节约工作深入到广大职工中去
    第一机械工业部第三机器工业管理局副局长　甘柏
    第一机械工业部第三机器工业管理局所属东北地区的五个工厂的增产节约运动，都经过了思想批判、动员群众、揭发浪费、下达指标、制定措施等过程。但到目前为止，只有个别工厂，如沈阳矿山机器厂的工作做得比较好，有具体的斗争目标和完成任务的方法，职工群众的情绪饱满；多数工厂的情况则很不好，增产节约指标长期停留在车间和工段的领导人员手里，广大职工在观望、等待，干劲不大。
    为什么增产节约运动在多数工厂里开展得不好呢？这主要是某些领导工作人员在领导工作中有缺点和偏差。这些，表现在以下五个方面：
    一、对增产节约运动的认识不全面，孤立地看待增产和节约。譬如大连工矿车辆厂的某些车间，连今年的生产任务是什么，完成生产任务的关键在哪里都还未搞清楚，却孤立地讨论如何节约车间经费，节约消耗材料等。有的工厂因为上半年任务没完成，拖下得太多，为了完成全年任务，竟不惜以大量借雇工人和外包加工零件等方法来完成任务，而对于如何挖掘本企业的潜力，产品成本是否会因此而提高等问题，却注意得不够。有的厂对于动员职工利用业余时间挖掘和收拣厂内的废铁兴致很高，对于节约办公费用很认真（这些当然需要），但对于最主要的节约——加强管理工作，降低废品率，节约原材料等则不大关心。沈阳重型机器厂的领导工作人员曾企图以增产钢锭的方法弥补机器等产品完成的差额，以完成该厂全年的生产总值和商品总值，而对于关系十分重大的机器产品（供应重点工程项目的设备）和为兄弟厂协作的大型锻件、铸件的品种计划反而不加重视。这个厂的机械安装队为了节约擦洗机器的纱布和油，竟允许用有泥沙的油去擦洗机器！抚顺重型机器厂的厂长虽然向下面布置了增产节约任务，并表示了完成任务的决心。但是，由于对当月生产任务未作具体督促检查，结果生产总值只完成计划的百分之六十六点一，商品总值只完成了计划的百分之三十二点五。
    二、群众没有充分动员起来。明显的浪费现象还没有为群众所深恶痛绝，很多工人对于增产节约运动还有不正确的了解。有的人说：“增产节约是一阵风，一年来一阵”，“问题一大堆，还增产节约？”“领导上不给解决问题，提出也没用”。沈阳重型机器厂有的车间把退回冒领的灯泡和根本不应该领的材料说是节约下来的。有些车间的桥式吊车司机，经常用十吨或二十吨重的吊车吊送不到一公斤重的饭盒和冰棍，也没有遭到车间工作人员和群众的制止。大连工矿车辆厂用一、二万元的措施费制造的专用设备，稍有毛病就废弃不用；六十吨翻车的铸钢车轮五十多个全部报废了。大连起重机器厂，过去每做一辆吊车要多用三吨多钢板，把切下的大块料头当废铁处理。有的工人要求克服这种浪费，但有关的技术部门竟不加理睬。这一情况，直到最近经过报纸批评和上级机关检查以后才有改变。这些现象说明，如果不提高职工群众的政治觉悟，厉行节约，反对浪费不成为群众的舆论中心，是无法彻底制止浪费的。
    三、缺乏对实际情况的全盘了解，没有制定出正确的定额。很多工厂平时不注意积累技术经济定额资料，在运动中又不深入下层摸情况，因此下达的增产节约指标不切合实际，车间和工段怀疑指标的可靠性，上下互相讨价还价，任务不能及时下达，群众等待不前。很多工厂对材料和成品缺乏严格的控制，如沈阳重型机器厂铸铁车间，虽然规定了节约指标，但每日所用的焦煤不过秤；锻造车间可以随便挑选锻钢锭；铸钢车间做过的大锻件不过秤、不统计。定额股原“计算”电铲柱的重量为十一吨，但浇注后的电铲柱用十五吨吊车吊不动；定额股“计算”压箱横梁为十一吨，而车间的估计只有三吨多。这个厂每个车间都规定节约暖气和用水的指标，但没有仪表来测量暖气和水的消耗量。钢锭的产量和销售量都是估计出来的，因此在季末或年末时常发生忽而盘盈数千吨、忽而盘亏数千吨的怪事……在这种情况下，如何能够进行正确的计划和严格的经济核算呢？
    四、贯彻计划的措施空洞，不切实，无法检查。有的工厂把每个科的措施（未经群众讨论，只是一个人想出来的）不加分析地罗列起来就作为全厂的措施，其中有的仅仅是口号，如“贯彻苏联专家建议”、“推广先进经验”、“改善质量，减低废品率”。抚顺重型机器厂某车间的许多措施项目，都没规定由谁负责执行和什么时候完成，这些措施就没有实现的保证。在很多工厂规定的措施中，都没根据本单位的具体任务和具体特点规定出改善企业管理的措施。
    五、很多工厂都没有组织劳动竞赛和制定适当的奖惩办法，所以群众的积极性没有充分发挥，劳动热忱不能巩固。有的工厂的工资政策执行得不合理，工人技术提高了，但三、四年没有晋级；技术高的工人被分配干技术等级低的活，虽然达到了定额，但几个月拿不到基本工资。三班工作制的工人共同加工一个活，不按工作量的多少分工资，而按工作的时间长短来分工资。很多工厂对优良的工作者不奖励，对违犯劳动纪律的也不给以应得的纪律制裁。这种情况严重地阻碍了增产节约的开展。
    产生以上缺点和偏差的主要原因，是企业的各级领导工作人员对增产节约的全面性、持久性认识不足，对经济工作缺乏具体的领导，依靠职工群众搞好生产的观点不明确。
    根据工作做得好的工厂的经验，要正确地开展增产节约运动，必须贯彻“统筹全局，掌握重点”的方针，层层发动群众揭发损失浪费，从本企业的具体情况出发，逐级研究本单位完成国家计划的主要环节和增产节约的重点，逐级颁发和确定各项指标，制定具体的技术组织措施计划。各科、室在统一领导下，按业务系统对各车间加以检查和帮助，以求全面贯彻。
    增产节约是经常的和长期的工作。绝不能当作短时间的突击运动；增产和节约是统一的相互影响的，绝不能孤立地片面地安排。同时，我们不但要努力完成今年任务，而且要准备明年的生产，因为明年任务繁重，在一定的条件下可将明年一、二季任务提前于今年生产。增产节约措施的重点应放在如何加强生产管理、改善计划、组织技术和经济等工作上。因此，各个厂就必须首先制定和安排计划，整顿组织，调整干部，正、副厂长在统一的方针和计划下分头掌握各种业务，提高企业的管理水平。
    必须积极地整理各种定额资料。为此科室人员要深入车间和实际工作中摸底，提出各科、室、各车间分门别类的各种经济技术指标草案。草案经过职工群众讨论和修正以后，必须完成。暂时提不出可靠的原材料消耗定额指标的单位，可以经过职工的讨论提出临时指标，限期积累资料，以后再正式规定指标，指标一经规定，就必须按指标控制物资材料，限额发料，各车间和仓库应添置必要的度量衡仪器，如电表、水表、气表及磅秤等，作为计量之用，以便考核评比成绩。
    增产节约的措施要明确具体，对症下药，相互衔接，有具体项目和工作内容、期限，有执行者和检查者。措施一经批准，必须组织全力贯彻。
    各工厂要加强政治工作，发动群众的革命热情和积极性，要大力支持群众的合理化建议。科室人员要切实帮助车间解决工作中的困难，给车间以有利条件。要规定出各种必要的奖惩制度，严格劳动纪律，贯彻计件工资制和计时奖励制，使国家利益同工人利益密切结合起来。要坚决消灭暗藏的反革命分子，为增产节约扫清障碍，以保证国家计划的顺利完成。
