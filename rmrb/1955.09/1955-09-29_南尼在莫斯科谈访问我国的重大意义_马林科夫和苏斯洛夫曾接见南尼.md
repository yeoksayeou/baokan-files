Xinhua News Agency, September 28th dispatch: According to a TASS report: The Secretary-General of the Italian Socialist Party and Member of Parliament, Nenni, Mrs. Nenni, and the Italian Socialists accompanying him, after staying in Moscow for a few days en route to the People's Republic of China, left Moscow by plane on the evening of the 27th to go to Beijing. Soviet public representatives were at the airport to see them off. Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, also went to see them off.

Nenni and his party visited places of interest in Moscow.

On September 27th, Nenni attended a banquet held by the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee and the Soviet Peace Committee. He said at the banquet: The situation is favorable for our long journey to China. This trip of ours has great significance. We are not going to the East to discover a new continent, but to meet friends who are fighting in the strong peace camp. Now, the summit conference of the four major powers is a fait accompli! Our belief in the future should be based on the firm conviction that the struggle for peace by the people of all countries will be further strengthened. It is with this kind of confidence that we are going to China, where the Chinese people stand shoulder to shoulder with the great Soviet people at the forefront of the struggle for peace.

Xinhua News Agency, September 28th dispatch from Moscow by TASS: G.M. Malenkov and M.A. Suslov received the famous Italian politician, Member of Parliament, and Secretary-General of the Italian Socialist Party, Pietro Nenni, who was passing through Moscow on his way to the People's Republic of China, on the 27th and spoke with him.

    南尼等一行在莫斯科曾参观了名胜古迹。
    九月二十七日，南尼出席了斯大林国际和平奖金委员会和苏联保卫和平委员会举行的宴会。他在宴会上说：我们动身去中国作长途旅行的形势是有利的。我们这次旅行有重大的意义。我们到东方去并不是为了发现一个新大陆，而是去会见在强大的和平阵营中进行斗争的朋友。现在，四大国首脑会议已是一个既成事实了！我们对于未来的信念应该以坚信各国人民进一步加强和平的斗争的胜利为基础。我们是带着这样一种信心前往中国的，中国人民同伟大的苏联人民肩并肩地站在争取和平的斗争的最前列。
