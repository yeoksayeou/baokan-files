The "Three Fixes" Implementation in Xinxiang Prefecture Promotes the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement

    The work of fixing grain output, purchase and sales quotas down to individual households, the "Three Fixes," has been basically completed in more than 1,100 villages in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, by early September. After the "Three Fixes" were implemented down to the households, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased, especially their enthusiasm for participating in mutual aid and cooperation. According to reports from Huixian County, before the "Three Fixes," 5,789 farm households in all 112 villages of the county requested to join cooperatives. After the "Three Fixes" were implemented down to the households, 16,980 households requested to join. According to reports from 75 villages in Wuzhi County, after the "Three Fixes" were implemented down to the households, more than 8,300 households requested to join cooperatives, accounting for 26 percent of the farm households who had not yet joined. Some farmers who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives now also stated that they would not withdraw and would concentrate on production within the cooperatives. In these 75 villages, more than 135,000 cartloads of fertilizer had been accumulated by late August. (Jin Chengbin)

    新乡专区“三定”到户工作推动了农业合作化运动
    河南新乡专区一千一百多个乡的粮食“三定”到户工作，九月初已基本结束。“三定”到户后，农民生产情绪普遍高涨，特别是参加互助合作的积极性更高。据辉县了解，全县一百一十二个乡，“三定”前有五千七百八十九户农民要求入社，“三定”到户后有一万六千九百八十户要求入社。据武陟县七十五个乡了解，“三定”到户后要求入社的农民有八千三百多户，占未入社农户的百分之二十六。另有一些要退社的农户现在也表示不退社，要在合作社里好好搞生产。这七十五个乡在八月下旬就已积了十三万五千多车肥料。（靳承斌）
