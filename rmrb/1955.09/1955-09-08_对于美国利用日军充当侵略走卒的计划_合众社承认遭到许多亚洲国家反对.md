Xinhua News Agency, 7th September. A dispatch from Tokyo by the United Press International (UPI) on the 6th admitted that the US plan in the US-Japan talks to have Japan send troops to join the Pacific aggressive bloc had met with "unanimous opposition" from many Asian countries. This was the conclusion UPI drew after investigating the local "official and public" reaction to the US plan from its eight branches in Asia.

UPI stated: "The Asian region, from the misty jungles of Malaya to the lush rice paddies of Korea, has vivid memories of Japanese aggression." "They will oppose any plan to station Japanese troops in their region as part of a Pacific defense group."

Referring to the reaction in Jakarta, UPI said: "Japanese troops will definitely not be allowed to be stationed in Indonesia." "An official said: 'We have suffered enough from them (Japanese troops) during the Second World War.'"

Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, according to UPI: "The people of Malaya are unwilling to have any more dealings with Japanese troops." "The government and people of Thailand will not welcome Japanese troops back to their land." "There is no doubt that the Philippines will reject any defense plan that requires Japanese troops to be stationed on their territory."

    对于美国利用日军充当侵略走卒的计划
    合众社承认遭到许多亚洲国家反对
    新华社七日讯　据合众社在六日从东京发出的一条电讯中承认，美国在日美会谈中要日本派兵参加太平洋侵略集团的计划，遭到了亚洲许多国家“一致的反对”。这是合众社从它在亚洲的八个分社就美国计划调查了当地的“官方和公众”的反应后得出的结论。
    合众社说：“从马来亚的水气蒙蒙的丛林一直到朝鲜的绿油油的稻田流域的亚洲地区，对于日本在太平洋的侵略记忆犹新。”“它们将反对把日本军队驻在它们的地区作为太平洋防御集团的一部分的任何计划。”
    合众社在谈到雅加达的反应时说：“日本军队肯定地将不会被允许驻扎在印度尼西亚”。“一位官员说：‘在第二次世界大战时，我们已经吃够了他们（日本军队）的苦头。’”
    在东南亚其他地方，据合众社说：“马来亚的老百姓们再不愿同日本军队发生关系”。“泰国的政府和人民将不欢迎日本军队再到他们的国土上来”。“毫无疑问，菲律宾将拒绝那种要求把日本军队驻扎在他们领土上的任何防御计划”。
