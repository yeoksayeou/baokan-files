Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 3rd: Eighty-one medium and small towns in Shanxi Province began implementing a grain rationing system on September 1st. The implementation of grain rationing in nine small towns has been slightly delayed due to ongoing preparations.

    Hundreds of staff members from state grain supply units in these towns have studied relevant policies and regulations, improved sales work based on residents' grain purchasing habits and opinions, and allocated grain varieties. In addition to preparing commonly used grain types for residents, the four state grain supply stations in Changzhi City have also increased varieties such as bean flour and oat flour.

    In August, the leading bodies of these towns formulated rationing plans, verified the population, investigated residents' grain consumption levels, solicited residents' opinions on occupational classifications and rationing standards, and re-publicized the state's grain supply policies to residents. Collective mess units such as organs, organizations, and schools have drawn up grain consumption plans in accordance with the new supply standards.
Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, September 3rd: After the official implementation of the grain rationing system in Chengde City, Hebei Province, from September 1st, citizens generally believed that this method was very reasonable and expressed their intention to further avoid waste and continue to save grain for the country. Wang Cuifen, a female representative of a street residents' group, plans to save six jin of grain in September after rationing and is actively mobilizing women to use grain more rationally. Wang Guizhi's family used to waste a lot of grain, consuming 140 to 150 jin of grain per month. During the grain saving campaign, she received education, paid attention to cherishing grain, and her family only consumed 125 jin of grain in July and reduced it to 110 jin in August. According to the rationing standard in September, her family can buy 103 jin of grain. After careful calculation, she said: "This amount of grain is enough to eat, and I am confident that I can save five jin of grain." According to the statistics of citizens' new grain purchase plans, citizens throughout the city will save more than 166,800 jin of grain per month starting in September compared to August.
    This newspaper, Wuhan, September 2nd: According to the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities" promulgated by the State Council and the actual situation in Wuhan, Wuhan City has formulated detailed rules for the implementation of grain rationing in Wuhan City, which were announced on September 2nd. The city will implement grain rationing from October 1st. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has transferred 200 staff members above the deputy section chief level to participate in the propaganda and other work for implementing grain rationing, and various districts are also actively training cadres and carrying out various preparatory work.

    Before formulating the detailed rules for rationing, the Finance, Grain and Trade Office of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee and the Municipal Grain Bureau organized investigation teams to investigate and calculate the actual grain consumption of various types of people in more than a dozen collective mess units and 3,000 households in Qianjin Street, Jianghan District, and divided the city's population into fourteen grades for grain rationing, initially determining the rationing for each grade. The initially determined grain rationing for each grade was revised after widely soliciting opinions from other collective mess units and residents. Therefore, the grading method and rationing standards for each grade stipulated in the detailed rules for the implementation of grain rationing in Wuhan City are quite reasonable and have been supported by the people of the city.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 2nd: The third session of the first People's Congress of Shenyang City, held from August 26th to 30th, discussed and approved the specific implementation plan formulated by the Municipal People's Committee in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities" promulgated by the State Council, and determined that the city will implement the grain rationing system from October 1st.

    山西省八十一个城镇和承德市
    开始实行粮食定量供应制度
    新华社太原三日电　山西省八十一个中、小城镇从九月一日开始实行粮食定量供应制度。有九个小城镇因准备工作还在进行，实行粮食定量供应的时间稍为推迟。
    这些城镇中几百个国家粮食供应单位的工作人员，学习了有关的政策法令，并根据居民的购粮规律和居民的意见，改进了销售工作，同时调配了粮食品种。长治市的四个国家粮食供应站除准备了居民惯用的粮种外，还增加豆面和莜面等品种。
    这些城镇的领导机构在八月份先后制定了定量供应的方案，核实了人口，调查了居民的粮食消费水平，征询了居民对职业分类和定量供应标准的意见，并向居民再次宣传了国家的粮食供应政策。各机关、团体、学校等集体伙食单位，按照新的供应标准订出了用粮计划。
    新华社承德三日电　热河省承德市从九月一日起正式实行粮食定量供应制度后，市民们都认为这一办法很合理，表示要进一步避免浪费，继续为国家节约粮食。街道居民组妇女代表王萃芬计划在定量供应后，九月份节约六斤粮食，并积极动员妇女群众更合理地使用粮食。居民王桂芝家中过去浪费粮食现象严重，每月用粮一百四五十斤。在节约粮食运动中，她受到了教育，注意爱惜粮食，七月份她家只用粮一百二十五斤，八月份又减少到一百一十斤。九月份按定量供应标准，她家可买粮食一百零三斤。她经过仔细计算后说：“这些粮食是够吃的，还有把握节约出五斤粮食来。”根据市民新的购粮计划统计，全市市民从九月份起，每月将比八月份节约粮食十六万六千八百多斤。
    本报武汉二日电　武汉市根据国务院颁布的“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”和本市的实际情况，制定了武汉市粮食定量供应实施细则，并已于九月二日公布。全市将从十月一日起实行粮食定量供应。中共武汉市委会已经抽调了副科长以上的二百名工作人员，参加实行粮食定量供应的宣传等工作，各区也正在积极训练干部，进行各项准备工作。
    在制定定量供应实施细则以前，武汉市人民委员会财粮贸办公室和市粮食局曾经组织调查组，分别调查和计算了十几个集体伙食单位和江汉区前进街三千户居民中各类人口的实际用粮数量，把全市人口的粮食定量划为十四等，初步确定了各等的定量。初步确定的各等粮食定量，经过广泛征求其他集体伙食单位和居民的意见以后，又作了修改。因此，武汉市粮食定量供应实施细则中规定的分等办法和各等定量标准都相当合理，受到全市人民的拥护。
    据新华社沈阳二日电　沈阳市八月二十六日到三十日召开的第一届人民代表大会第三次会议，讨论并通过了市人民委员会根据国务院颁布的“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”制定的具体执行方案，并确定全市从十月一日开始实行粮食定量供应制度。
