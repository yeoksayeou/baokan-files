Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 19th: In the more than 12,000 townships in Henan Province that have completed the "Three Fixes" grain work down to the household level, farmers are working hard to achieve better harvests for autumn crops.

In these townships, agricultural producers' cooperatives and some perennial mutual aid teams have revised their autumn crop production increase plans and raised their production increase targets. In the Guzhuang Township Third Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xuchang County, the 75 surplus grain households, after selling their surplus grain according to the fixed purchase quotas, had more surplus grain left for their own disposal than last year. 社员谷根成 (Sheyuan Gu Gengcheng) works hard and has twice as much grain left as last year. Encouraged by the "Three Fixes" work, their autumn crop production increase plans are all higher than the fixed production figures. Four agricultural producers' cooperatives and seven perennial mutual aid teams in Chongyi Township, Anyang County, have launched a production increase competition. The Third Agricultural Producers' Cooperative has, in addition to applying two and a half cartloads of crude fertilizer per mu to cotton, sorghum, corn, and rice according to the original plan, now added another ten jin of fertilizer powder, hoed the late rice and cornfields one more time, and decided to apply phosphorus fertilizer to the wheat stubble cotton that lacks it. Farmers in cotton-producing areas, after seeing the various preferential treatments and rewards for cotton farmers mentioned in the Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas, were even more motivated to increase cotton production. The Wusan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xixinan Village, Anyang County, is striving to increase the total production of ginned cotton by more than 8,000 jin for the entire cooperative.

In the townships that have completed the "Three Fixes" work down to the household level, more and more farmers are requesting to participate in mutual aid and cooperation. Li Zhenling and four other mutual aid teams in Cai Zhang Township, Eleventh District, Changge County, have repeatedly requested to become cooperatives. Before the "Three Fixes" work, there were only two temporary mutual aid teams in Zhouzhuang Village, Luyi County, and after the "Three Fixes" work, six new perennial mutual aid teams were established.

    河南结束粮食“三定”工作地区农民争取丰收
    据新华社郑州十九日电　河南省已经结束粮食“三定”到户工作的一万两千多个乡里，农民们正在紧张地争取秋季作物得到更好的收成。
    在这些乡里，农业生产合作社和一些常年互助组都修订了秋季作物增产计划，提高了增产指标。许昌县谷庄乡第三农业生产合作社七十五户余粮户，按定购指标出卖余粮后，留下自由处理的剩余粮食都比去年多。社员谷根成劳动好，留的粮食超过去年一倍。他们在“三定”工作鼓舞下，订的秋季作物增产计划都比定产数字高。安阳县崇义乡四个农业生产合作社和七个常年互助组开展了增产竞赛。第三农业生产合作社的棉花、高粱、玉米和稻子，除按原计划每亩追施了两车半粗肥外，现在又增施了十斤肥田粉，在晚稻和玉米地里多锄了一遍，并决定对缺少磷肥的麦茬棉花追施磷肥。棉产区的农民看到农村粮食统购统销暂行办法中提出的对棉农的各项照顾和奖励后，更加激发了增产棉花的热情。安阳县西辛安村五三农业生产合作社，正争取全社增产籽棉八千多斤。
    结束了“三定”到户的乡里，要求参加互助合作的农户越来越多了。长葛县十一区蔡张乡李振岭等四个互助组，曾几次请求转社。鹿邑县周庄村在“三定”以前只有两个临时互助组，“三定”以后又新成立了六个常年互助组。
