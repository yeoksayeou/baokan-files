    Educate Peasants to Save Grain
    Chen Zhao
    In the past two or three months, wheat, early rice, and mid-season rice have been harvested successively, and many farm families have new grain. According to reports from various places, after the new grain harvest, the phenomenon of wasting grain continues to occur in rural areas. For example, some members of the Yongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kui Jing Township, Huaining County, Anhui Province, said: "Last year we broke the levee and suffered for a year; this year we have a bumper harvest, so we must enjoy it more!" During the early rice harvest, this cooperative temporarily hired many laborers from other places, put on a big show, and ate and drank extravagantly in the collective meals, using up 7,075 catties of rice in three days, accounting for one-third of the rice harvested in these three days. Therefore, after the new grain is harvested, the publicity and education work on saving grain in various places must be carried out intensively. Doing this work well is of great significance for ensuring the implementation and adherence to the measures of fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales.
    According to past habits, the period from the summer harvest and autumn harvest to the Spring Festival is the period when the most grain is wasted in rural areas. During this period, many farm families not only do not know how to save grain when cooking and feeding livestock, but also use a lot of grain to boil sugar and brew wine. Because many farmers wasted a lot of grain during this period, by the following spring and summer, when field production is intense and more grain is needed, they feel that there is not enough grain. This situation not only increases the difficulties of farmers in production and life, but also increases the burden of grain supply on the state. This year's harvests are very good, and bumper harvests are a certainty in many areas. The state has also determined the figures for fixed grain production and fixed purchases. The state's purchases of grain from farmers have decreased compared to last year, so it is certain that the surplus grain in the hands of farmers this autumn will increase significantly. Under these circumstances, educating farmers to save grain and preventing the growth of the trend of wasting grain is even more important.
    The state's determination of the figures for grain purchases from farmers for the 1955-1956 fiscal year is slightly lower than the previous year and will remain stable for three years, which is of course of great benefit to farmers. However, to stabilize this quantity of grain purchased, it is necessary to resolutely compress the sales volume of grain in urban and rural areas and eliminate the phenomenon of wasting grain in cities and villages. Therefore, whether in cities or villages, it is necessary to vigorously promote saving grain. At the same time, it should be seen that rural areas have favorable conditions for saving grain. There are many kinds of melons and vegetables in rural areas. During the period of large harvests of melons and vegetables, eating more melons and vegetables can save a portion of grain, which can be reserved for consumption during the spring plowing season next year or at other times when grain is needed. The straw, husks, and fruits of many crops and wild plants in rural areas are feed for poultry and livestock. Mobilizing farmers to seize the favorable season to collect and store these feeds in large quantities can not only save grain, but also ensure that livestock have sufficient feed, which is beneficial to the development of animal husbandry and poultry farming.
    In order to save grain, it is necessary to educate farmers to make annual arrangements for the use of grain. That is to say, it is necessary to rationally allocate the grain in their hands according to the different seasons and different needs throughout the year, and avoid the phenomenon of being loose in the beginning and tight at the end in the use of grain. After the implementation of fixed grain production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales, the figures for unified purchase and supply by the state throughout the year have been predetermined, and farmers have a "bottom line" in their hearts, making it relatively easy to make an overall arrangement for the grain they will use throughout the year.
    Publicity and education on saving grain should be carried out differently, targeting different objects. Within agricultural production cooperatives, every cooperative should be made to play a leading role in saving grain. Feed grain is the largest item of grain consumption in agricultural cooperatives, and efforts should be made to save grain in this area by improving livestock feeding methods and storing more fodder. Agricultural cooperatives must adopt necessary systems to manage the public grain in the cooperative, and it must not be used indiscriminately. Some cooperative members believe that the cooperative has a large family business and can show off and use more grain. This idea does not conform to the spirit of diligence and frugality in running the cooperative and must be criticized. Agricultural cooperatives should also pay constant attention to educating members to save grain, especially after distribution, it is even more necessary to strengthen this education.
    Grain-deficient households, farmers who grow cash crops, people in disaster areas, and fishermen, salt workers, and boat people in general grain-producing areas in rural areas are the objects of rural grain supply, and these grain-deficient people should pay special attention to saving grain. They should be told that the state guarantees the supply of grain they need, but they must not falsely report grain shortages and buy more grain, and they must not waste grain. That is to say, these grain-deficient people should propose the amount of grain they need according to the principle of saving, reporting how much they lack, not reporting more than they lack; buying when they lack, not buying in advance. Especially in the period after the new grain is harvested, grain-deficient households should try to save grain as much as possible, and not buy or buy less state grain, so that the state grain supply departments can guarantee to supply them with the necessary grain in the season when they need grain the most.
    For self-sufficient households, whether they can allocate the grain in their hands according to the principle of saving is a very important matter. Because the grain in the hands of self-sufficient households is only enough to eat and use, and is not very abundant. If they are good at saving and allocating it properly, they can live a good life. However, if they consume too much grain, they may change from self-sufficient households to "grain-deficient households." In the past, the state also supplied grain to this kind of undue "grain-deficient households," which caused an abnormal expansion of the rural grain supply. However, after the implementation of the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Rural Grain," the state no longer supplies grain to farmers who were originally rated as self-sufficient households. Therefore, self-sufficient households must dispel the incorrect idea of "asking the state to supply grain after it is eaten up" and avoid wasting grain.
    Education on saving grain should also be carried out for grain-surplus households. Grain-surplus households should be told that after completing the tasks of unified purchase and agricultural tax, their surplus grain will be entirely at their disposal, so saving grain is also their own. It is of course entirely proper for grain-surplus farmers to take out some of their grain to improve their lives, and no one can interfere. However, it should be noted that improving life should not become extravagance and waste, and the improvement of life should not exceed the level of production development. Farmers with surplus grain should improve their lives while saving more grain to expand production. This will continuously increase production and improve life.
    In order to save grain, it is also necessary to strictly control the sales volume of grain in rural areas from the grain supply side. Grain supply departments in various places should carefully review the rural grain unified sales targets for the third quarter and compress as much as possible the amount of grain that should not be sold and is sold too much. In particular, in areas where the "three fixings" work has not yet been carried out to households, since the amount of grain supplied to grain-deficient households has not yet been determined, it is easy to waste grain and sell too much grain if attention is not paid to saving grain education and strictly controlling the sales volume of grain. This must be paid close attention to. In addition, although the grain unified sales work in some areas has been rectified, the chaotic phenomenon of township staff randomly issuing grain purchase certificates has occurred again. These areas must quickly take effective measures to eliminate the chaotic phenomenon in grain supply and reduce the sales volume of grain that can be reduced.

### 教育农民节约粮食

    教育农民节约粮食
    陈昭
    最近两三个月来，小麦、早稻中稻陆续登场，许多农家都有了新粮。据各地反映，在新粮收获以后，农村中浪费粮食的现象不断地发生。例如，安徽省怀宁县盔井乡永丰农业生产合作社有些社员说：“去年破了圩，受了一年苦；今年丰收了，可要多多享用一点！”这个社在收割早稻期间，临时雇了很多外地的劳动力，大摆排场，在集体伙食方面大吃大喝，三天就用掉了七千零七十五斤稻谷，占这三天收割的稻子的三分之一。因此，在新粮收下来以后，各地对节约粮食的宣传教育工作，必须抓紧进行。做好这一工作对保证粮食定产、定购、定销办法的实施、贯彻，具有重要的意义。
    根据历年的习惯，从夏收、秋收到春节的期间是农村浪费粮食最多的时期。在这个期间，许多农家不但做饭和喂养牲畜不知节约粮食，而且用很多粮食熬糖煮酒。许多农民由于在这个期间浪费了大量的粮食，到次年春夏季，正当田间生产紧张、需要多吃多用粮食的时候，就感到粮食不够了。这种情况不但使农民增加了生产和生活方面的困难，而且给国家加重了粮食供应的负担。今年年景很好，许多地区丰收已成定局，而国家也确定了粮食定产和定购的数字，国家向农民征购的粮食比去年减少，因此今年秋后农民手里的余粮将有显著的增加，是可以肯定的。在这种情况下，教育农民节约粮食，防止浪费粮食的风气滋长，就更显得重要了。
    国家确定的一九五五年到一九五六年度向农民征购粮食的数字比上一年度略有减少，而且稳定三年不变，这当然对于农民是大有好处的。但是要把这个粮食统购数量稳定下来，就必须坚决压缩城乡的粮食销售量，消除城市和乡村中浪费粮食的现象。因此，不论在城市和农村，都必须大力提倡节约粮食。同时，应当看到，农村是有节约粮食的有利条件的。农村中各种瓜菜很多，在大量收获瓜菜的时期，多吃些瓜菜，就可以省下一部分粮食，留到明年春耕时期或其他需要粮食的时候食用。农村里的许多农作物和野生植物的藁秆、皮壳和果实等，都是家禽和牲畜饲料，发动农民抓紧有利的季节把这些饲料大量地收集和贮备起来，这样不但可以节约粮食，而且可以保证牲畜有充足的饲料，这对发展养畜业和养禽业是有利的。
    为了节约粮食，必须教育农民对粮食的使用作全年的安排。也就是说，要根据一年中的不同季节和不同需要合理地支配自己手里的粮食，避免粮食使用中的前松后紧现象。实行粮食的定产、定购、定销以后，国家在一年中统购和供应的数字已经预先确定，农民心里有了“底”，要对自己全年所要使用的粮食作出通盘安排，是比较容易做到的。
    节约粮食的宣传教育，应当分别不同情况针对不同对象进行。在农业生产合作社内，应当使每一个社都在节约粮食方面起带头作用。饲料粮食是农业合作社中用粮最多的一个项目，在这方面应当从改进牲畜饲养方法、多贮备饲草等方面想办法节约粮食。农业合作社对社里公共的粮食要采取必要的制度加以管理，不能滥用。有些社的社员认为社里家业大、可以讲讲排场，多用些粮食，这种想法是不符合勤俭办社的精神的，必须给以批判。农业合作社还要经常注意对社员进行节约粮食的教育，特别在分配以后，加强这一教育更有必要。
    农村中一般粮食产区的缺粮户、种经济作物的农民、灾区人民以及渔民、盐民、船民等，是农村粮食供应的对象，这些缺粮人民应当特别注意节约粮食。应当向他们说明，国家对他们所需要的粮食是保证供应的，但是他们不能虚报缺粮和多买粮食，不能浪费粮食。这就是说，这些缺粮人民应当根据节约的原则来提出自己需要的粮食数量，缺多少就报多少，不要缺少报多；什么时候缺，就在什么时候买，不要提前购买。特别是在新粮收下来后的一段时间内，缺粮户应当尽量节约粮食，不买或少买国家的粮食，这样，国家粮食供应部门就能够在他们最需要粮食的季节保证把必需的粮食供应给他们。
    对于自足户来说，能否按节约原则来支配自己手里的粮食，是一件很关紧要的事情。因为自足户手里的粮食本来就只是够吃够用，而并不十分丰裕，如果善于节约，支配得当，日子可以过得不坏；但如果过多地耗费了粮食，他们就可能由自足户变成“缺粮户”。过去国家对这种不应有的“缺粮户”也供应了粮食，曾因此造成了农村粮食供应面不正常的扩大。可是实行“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”以后，国家对原评定为自足户的农民，就不再供应粮食了，因此自足户必须打消过去那种“吃完了再要求国家供应”的不正确的想法，避免粮食的浪费。
    对余粮户也应当进行节约粮食的教育。应当向余粮户说明，在完成统购和农业税任务后，他们的余粮将完全归自己支配，因此，节约了粮食也是他们自己的。余粮户拿出自己的一部分粮食来改善生活，这当然是完全应当的，任何人都不能加以干涉。不过要注意的是，不要使改善生活变成铺张浪费，不要使生活的改善超越了生产发展的水平。有余粮的农民应当做到既改善生活，同时又节约出更多的粮食来扩大生产。这样就能不断增加生产和改善生活。
    为了节约粮食，还必须从粮食供应方面严格控制农村粮食的销量。各地粮食供应部门对第三季度农村粮食统销指标应认真地加以审查，尽可能压缩那些不应销和多销的粮食数量。特别是目前还没有进行“三定”到户工作的地区，由于对缺粮户的粮食供应数量还没有确定下来，如果不注意节约粮食的教育和严格控制粮食销售量，就很容易发生浪费粮食和多销粮食的现象。这是必须十分注意的。另外，还有些地区的粮食统销工作虽已经过整顿，但嗣后很快又发生了乡的工作人员乱开购粮证明的混乱现象。这些地区必须迅速采取有效措施，消除粮食供应中的混乱现象，把可以削减的粮食销售量削减下来。
