The market in Beijing is more prosperous than usual on the eve of the holiday. More customers than usual visit the city and suburban state-owned stores and cooperatives every day, and the sales staff of private retail stores are also busier than usual. Sales of clothing, floral shirts, woolens, leather shoes, sweaters, yarn, cosmetics, fruits, candies, and various foods have greatly increased compared to usual. The First Paper Flower Floss Silk Supply and Production Cooperative and more than two hundred paper flower shops supply a large number of paper flowers for holiday parades every day. In various flower shops, horticultural workers trim blooming tuberoses, dahlias, wintersweets, and roses into bouquets and supply them in batches. The city's eighteen major vegetable markets have prepared ample fresh vegetables. More than twenty kinds of vegetables, such as tomatoes, Chinese cabbage, cucumbers, lotus roots, rapeseed, and green peppers, transported from the suburbs and other places, are piled up in the vegetable markets. The transaction volume of many vegetable markets has doubled compared to usual.

In the bustling Wangfujing Street, the newly opened department store attracts tens of thousands of customers. From the 25th to the 28th, it received 346,000 customers in four days, and the sales amount was more than double the usual sales amount of the State-owned Department Store's First and Fourth Stores. Among them, the sales of clothing, shirts, silks and satins, woolens, sweaters, children's products, White Lex shoes, cosmetics, candies, canned goods, and other supplies accounted for 40% of the total sales. The merchants and stallholders in Dong'an Market have carried out cleaning and sweeping in recent days, and have added a large number of daily necessities, local products, and special handicrafts. In these few days, tens of thousands of customers have come to the jointly owned state-private Daoxiangcun Food Store to purchase food every day. The fresh candied fruits, sausages, ham, braised chicken, smoked fish, and moon cakes produced by this food store are very popular with customers. All private department stores in the city that have established consignment sales and wholesale purchase relationships with state-owned companies have added new products to welcome the festival.

The Dongxiao Market, which directly serves the countryside, has recently seen thousands of farmers and rural vendors come here every day to purchase children's hats, flannel shirts and pants, yarn, cold cream, hair ties, hair clips, and other supplies. The business volume of more than 2,200 merchants and stallholders has generally increased. In Tianqiao, the eastern suburban factory area, and Shijingshan, where working people live, department stores and cooperatives suddenly become lively every noon or evening. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Cooperative has supplied employees with three to four times more meat, fish, chicks, fruits, and white wine than it did during last year's National Day.

    在热闹的王府井大街，刚开幕的百货大楼吸引着成千上万的顾客，从二十五日到二十八日四天中，接待了顾客三十四万六千人，售货金额相当于国营百货公司第一、第四门市部往常销售额的一倍多。其中服装、衬衣、绸缎、呢绒、毛衣、儿童用品、白力士鞋、化妆品、糖果、罐头等用品的销售额占总销售额的百分之四十。东安市场的座商、摊商连日来进行了清洁扫除，新添了大批日用百货、土产品和特种工艺品。这几天，每天有上万的顾客到公私合营稻香春食品店选购食品。这个食品店出品的新鲜果脯、香肠、火腿、扒鸡、熏鱼和月饼等很受顾客欢迎。全市所有和国营公司建立代销、批购关系的私营百货商店，都新添了商品，迎接佳节。
    直接为农村服务的东晓市场，近来每天都有几千个农民和农村商贩来这里选购小孩帽子、绒衣绒裤、毛线、雪花膏、头绳、发夹等用品，二千二百多家座商、摊商的营业额普遍上升。在劳动人民聚居的天桥、东郊工厂区和石景山等地，每到中午或傍晚，百货商店和合作社就骤然热闹起来。石景山钢铁厂合作社已供应职工的各种肉类、鱼产、小鸡、水果和白酒比去年国庆节供应的数量多三、四倍。
