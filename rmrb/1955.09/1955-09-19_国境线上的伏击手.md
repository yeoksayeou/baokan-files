    Ambush Expert on the Border Line
    Bai Lang
    Zala's Childhood
    Zala—the son of a poor Lahu peasant in Yunnan—lost his father at the age of seven. Besides hard days, his father left his mother with four ignorant children—Zala and his brothers and sisters. Under their mother’s hard work and upbringing, they managed to survive, but poverty and fatigue soon tormented their mother to death. The death of their mother brought a crisis of life to the children and brewed a tragedy of separation. The children used their mother's only legacy—an iron pot—to exchange for a thin coffin with the local landlord Luo Weichang in Fuyong Village, Fubang District, Lancang County, and buried their mother before scattering in all directions! Nine-year-old Zala, like the iron pot, belonged to the landlord and became Luo Weichang's shepherd. However, his fate was not even as good as that iron pot!

    Skinny and small, Zala was not even as tall as a horse's leg, but he was responsible for feeding three horses and three cows. Not to mention the grazing and grass cutting alone, which already far exceeded his small physical burden. After heavy labor, he was often beaten and scolded viciously by the landlord. He was never full or warm. Sometimes, he couldn't help but envy the lives of his companions—the cattle and horses.

    The mountains in that area were high and full of wild animals. One day, one of Zala's horses was bitten to death by a sudden leopard attack, which was a common occurrence. However, Luo Weichang, who was even fiercer than a wild beast, had no humanity. He gave Zala a terrible beating! Zala was not willing to die in the hands of the landlord. He stole away with hatred and whip marks to seek refuge with an old hunter in a Lahu village. Although the old man's family was poor and had a lot of children, he took in the homeless Zala. From then on, Zala not only had a temporary home but also learned the skill of shooting. The old man loved Zala's bravery and intelligence. When Zala was thirteen years old, he gave him a bronze cannon gun for hunting animals, replacing the original bow and arrow for shooting birds. Zala was really happy. He became a little hunter! He truly lived up to the old man's training and expectations, killing a leopard and three bears with that gun.

    Who would have thought that such good days would not last long? In the year when Zala was fourteen years old, the old man passed away. After that, Zala became an orphan again. In order to survive, he had to work as a cowherd. Thus, hunger, cold, and abuse fell on Zala again!
    Zala Returns Home
    When the good news of the birth of New China made every remote corner boil with cheers, Zala had already bid farewell to his childhood and grown into a very handsome young man. In the winter of that year, the guerrilla team led by the Chinese Communist Party came to the border area. Zala had a deep hatred for those who oppressed and exploited him. However, year after year of life as a small prisoner made him have no opportunity to approach people who could enlighten him. Therefore, while cheering for liberation, he couldn't help but feel confused: Where did the guerrillas come from? Where would he go after being rescued from the cage?

    However, Zala was not without his own ideals. How much he envied the little soldiers in the guerrilla team carrying guns! Zala had loved guns since he was a child, but now he hadn't touched a gun for several years. If he could carry a gun like those little soldiers... No, it was a dream! Oh, how fun was the little bugler! Look at him raising his small face seriously. With a bugle call, the team would gather—for meals, meetings, drills, weeding, and even learning culture. If he could also... No, it was a dream! Zala didn't dare to have any hope at all.

    Li Xiaochun, the captain of the guerrilla team, had long admired Zala. Zala's intelligent and innocent face showed that he was a capable child. One day, he came to chat with Zala. They talked a lot. Finally, Li Xiaochun asked Zala a question:
    "Zala, are you willing to join the guerrilla team?"
    Did he even need to ask? Zala was too willing, too willing. Zala never thought that the army would accept him. He was so happy that his heart blossomed. He couldn't remember when he had been so happy! From that time on (January 1950), Zala—the son of the working people—truly returned to his home. He was seventeen years old at that time. In June of that year, the guerrilla team was reorganized and expanded, and Zala officially became a glorious fighter of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The leaders of the company discussed with him, found out his Chinese surname, and changed Zala's nickname to Yuan Yingzhong.
    Capturing Prisoners
    In June 1951, the Kuomintang remnants clamored for "counterattacking the mainland." Our army lured the enemy in deep and annihilated part of the invading remnants, and part of them escaped. At that time, the Second Company, where Yuan Yingzhong was located, was stationed in an area close to the Lahu ethnic group. After the company headquarters received the task of searching the mountains, a group of Yuan Yingzhong was ordered to set off overnight. Yuan Yingzhong led the team and walked very vigilantly in the front. At dawn, they arrived at Dongzhai.

    Suddenly, a figure faintly appeared in the distance. Yuan Yingzhong immediately stared at him. After a while, he could see it more clearly: the man was wearing a raincoat and carrying a bag, completely dressed as a Lahu villager. However, look at him looking around, his expression was so flustered, and his steps were so hurried. Yuan Yingzhong judged that this guy was definitely not a villager. He told his comrades to hide well and not to disturb him too early. Then, he hid himself.

    Closer, closer, in a few seconds, the sneaky guy would walk in front of Yuan Yingzhong. Yuan Yingzhong shot out sparks of hatred in his eyes, excitedly holding the bayonet-mounted gun, and rushed up in one stride:
    "Surrender your guns and you won't be killed!"
    The guy was so frightened when he saw the flashing bayonet that his legs went weak. He raised his hands and didn't dare to move.
    "Speak quickly, what are you doing?" Yuan Yingzhong's bayonet was tightly pressed against the guy's chest. The guy stammered:
    "Sending… sending letters…"
    A search of the bag revealed two letters. It turned out to be a secret message from the 13th Bandit Company to the Bandit Battalion Commander. Yuan Yingzhong asked the prisoner about the location of the Bandit Battalion headquarters and immediately reported to the company commander. The company commander ordered the entire company to pursue. Four miles away, they arrived in an instant. More than ten minutes later, they quietly surrounded a village. When Yuan Yingzhong led a platoon into the village, the enemy was still sound asleep. Several soldiers rushed up and pressed the enemies under their bodies before they could figure out what was going on.
    "Surrender your guns and you won't be killed! Anyone who runs will be shot dead!" At this time, the snipers also surrounded them, and the enemy dared not move anymore.
    In this way, more than twenty bandits were rounded up in one go, and more than six horses, twenty cattle, guns and ammunition, gold and silver, and a bandit flag with the Kuomintang emblem were seized.
    Mobilizing the Masses
    The Black Mountain in Yunnan is a forest area of more than a hundred miles, and it is also a mountainous area where various ethnic groups live together. The dense primeval forest conceals extremely fierce bandits. The bandits in the Black Mountain have been famous throughout history. In 1952, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the Black Mountain to suppress bandits, the people were blinded by the rumors of the bandits, and no one dared to approach the People's Liberation Army. However, if you want to wipe out the long-standing bandit gangs, how can you start without relying on the masses? And if you want to mobilize the masses, you must first understand the languages of the brotherly ethnic groups. Who understands? After thinking about it, the Lahu soldier Yuan Yingzhong was selected. In this way, Yuan Yingzhong took on this serious task and became the backbone of mobilizing the masses.

    After joining the army, Yuan Yingzhong was obviously getting smarter and smarter. Under the education of the Party, his multifaceted talents have been fully developed. In battle, he has the vigilance of an eagle and the bravery of a tiger. In his interactions with the masses, he is understanding and reasonable, yet gentle and kind like a lovable lamb. Usually, he is as peaceful and calm as a girl, but when he preaches to the masses, his words are so persuasive and inflammatory.
    This time in Black Mountain, when the troops first entered Laohetan, they didn’t know what was going on. The people were also afraid of the PLA, some ran away, and some went to join the bandits. Yuan Yingzhong was ordered by the platoon leader to go to the masses to find out the situation. He really felt unsure, but he was still very determined to complete the task. How to complete it? He first thought about how to approach the masses in his heart. He didn't smoke, but he took out a pack of cigarettes.

    He walked into the home of a man named He. The family had a paralyzed old man, an old woman, and six or seven children chirping. The head of the household was the eldest son, in his thirties. As soon as Yuan Yingzhong walked in, he was so scared that he turned and ran. Yuan Yingzhong called him to stop with a gentle expression and said:
    "Old folks, sorry to bother you. Come on, have a cigarette!"
    The man took the cigarette with a look of doubt on his face. Yuan Yingzhong said again:
    "Don't be afraid, old folks. The PLA is not like the Chiang bandits. They don't steal or rob, and they don't take a needle or a thread from the people. If you don't believe me, just watch!"
    The man just stared blankly at Yuan Yingzhong, without saying a word.
    The next day, Yuan Yingzhong went again. In addition to cigarettes, he also sent some needles and thread. Needles and thread are rare things in the local area. The man was so happy that he started talking. He quietly asked Yuan Yingzhong:
    "You are a Lahu child, why do you want to be 'Liberation'? 'Liberation' will kill people."
    "What are you talking about!" Yuan Yingzhong smiled kindly, "'Liberation' and Lahu are one family. 'Liberation' also comes from the common people. Don't worry, they will never kill people."
    Although Yuan Yingzhong's words were kind and sincere, the man was still skeptical. He shook his head and said to himself: "I'm just afraid!"
    Yuan Yingzhong felt that he was very honest. He reported his contact with him to the platoon leader. The platoon leader estimated that this person could be cultivated and asked Yuan Yingzhong to patiently enlighten and educate him. Sure enough, the platoon leader's estimate was not wrong. When Yuan Yingzhong went for the third time, the man was more natural. He took the initiative to ask:
    "'Liberation', what's your name?"
    "Zala," Yuan Yingzhong replied. The man tentatively asked again:
    "Zala, are you afraid of 'Liberation'?"
    "I'm not afraid. If I was afraid, I wouldn't have joined. 'Liberation' is so benevolent! Old He, have you seen 'Liberation' hit anyone?"
    "No." Of course not, he only saw "Liberation" helping the people with all kinds of work. He pondered for a while before stammering:
    "Zala, I have something to tell Zala!"
    Listening to his tone and looking at his expression, Yuan Yingzhong guessed that he had something he dared not say, so he said very enthusiastically:
    "Old He, tell Zala everything, 'Liberation' and Lahu are one family!"
    "I have a bronze cannon gun, give it to 'Liberation', okay?"
    "No, no," Yuan Yingzhong shook his head decisively and said: "'Liberation' has plenty of guns. Keep it for shooting birds." Then he put the gifts he brought: salt, towels, and needles and thread in front of Old He, saying that he would subsidize his life.
    Old He touched the gifts with wonder, so moved that his lips trembled. Finally, he said with excitement the words he had been holding back for a long time:
    "Zala, you must not tell anyone, both of my brothers have gone abroad!"
    Yuan Yingzhong's heart suddenly moved, but he controlled himself and said calmly:
    "It doesn't matter, they are still one family when they come back in the future."
    "They were dragged by the Kuomintang to become bandits. Zala, it would be good to call them back, do you have any way?"
    "Yes, it would be good to call them back, let me think about it." Yuan Yingzhong hid his joy, comforted Old He, and returned to the army to report and request tasks.
    The superior Party committee approved his plan. Yuan Yingzhong immediately mobilized Old He to accompany his mother to mobilize his brothers to come back. Three days later, the old lady really mobilized her two sons to come back. She also brought back five other youths who had been dragged away and five rifles.

    The old man was so happy! She was so moved that she killed the pig she was preparing for the funeral of the paralyzed old man and forced Yuan Yingzhong and his companions to eat a meal of new rice.
    Through the education of such examples, the masses in Laohetan were mobilized. The PLA established a very high prestige among the masses, and the army and the people forged an inseparable friendship. When the troops were transferred and asked the masses to give their opinions, the masses said: "Our opinion is that you don't leave." Men, women, old and young cried and refused to let the PLA go. There was no way, so the troops left four days late. When they set off, more than two hundred people scrambled to carry their backpacks, sending them out for more than a hundred miles. Later, the masses in Laohetan knew that the troops were short of vegetables, so they often drove livestock to send them vegetables from afar. They also sent two big red flags.
    Two Battles
    Just as heavy snow was flying, the PLA arrived in Ximeng District and settled down in a village. As soon as the troops arrived, they searched the mountains, ambushed, and cleared the remnants of the bandits. However, the enemies were very cunning, and their vigilance was extremely strict. The troops ambushed several times and failed. The soldiers were really unconvinced: Can't we really deal with the enemy? The soldiers' desire to eliminate the enemy became more urgent. Everyone asked for tasks one after another, and even the cooks and buglers were not willing to lag behind.

    On the night of February 2nd (1953), Zhao Yunde, the squad leader of Yuan Yingzhong, led their entire squad to ambush at the Naxi River on the border line. It was cold, the road was slippery, and the night was dark, but the ambition to kill the enemy encouraged them. No one felt cold. They walked one pulling the other. Although it was hard, they didn't feel too tired. In the middle of the night, they ambushed in the woods on the small mountain.

    At dawn, the squad leader suddenly found a dozen people walking in the mountain pass opposite, about two hundred meters away. The squad leader's eyes were blurred and he couldn't see clearly. He called Yuan Yingzhong over and said: "Take a closer look, are the people walking over there the enemy or the villagers?"
    Yuan Yingzhong was good at distinguishing between the enemy and us. He determined that they must be the enemy at a glance at the way they walked. So he and the squad leader quickly slid down the hillside and rushed to the side of the road, pushing the bullets into the chamber. Before they could ambush properly, the enemy's footsteps were already sounding. Yuan Yingzhong and the squad leader quickly hid in the weeds, not moving; if they moved, the weeds would make a loud rustling sound, which would startle the snake. After a while, an enemy walked over cautiously. Yuan Yingzhong could reach him with a hand. But the squad leader didn't let him move, saying that this was a scout, don't disturb him, there must be more behind. Yuan Yingzhong had to suppress his excitement, unscrew the lid of the grenade and wait. At this time, two girls from the Lahu village came towards the enemy. They saw Yuan Yingzhong lying in the grass at a glance. The girls smiled at him, and he quickly winked. The girls immediately understood, put away their smiles, hummed "The East is Red" in a low voice, and walked forward as if nothing had happened.
    "Ma Ya (girl), is there 'Liberation'?" This was the fierce voice of the enemy coming from the opposite side.
    "Ma Zhu! (meaning no)" the girl answered calmly while walking past the enemy.
    The enemy cursed the girl fiercely, and while cursing, he reached Yuan Yingzhong. But it was really terrible, the seven cunning enemies were tied up and carrying four people, if they fought, wouldn't they hurt the people too? So they had to let them go again.

    Finally, the squad leader redeployed the mission: divide the entire squad into two groups, preparing to attack from the front and back. The first group followed behind the enemy, and the second group went around to the front of the enemy. Yuan Yingzhong was assigned to the first group as a scout. He hadn't walked far when he saw an enemy hidden in the grass far away. Yuan Yingzhong jumped over and shouted: "Surrender your guns and you won't be killed!" Before the shout fell, a burst of bullets whizzed past his shoulder. He quickly returned fire with two shots, and the guy fell into the blood like a dead dog. A search revealed that he was a company commander of the bandits.

    The eight or nine enemies in the front and back were all panicked when they heard the gunfire. They forced the captured villagers to roll down the hillside and were about to escape when the snipers arrived. A fierce burst of fire killed the enemies, injured them, and some fled in panic. This ambush can't be considered a victory, but they still felt it wasn't enough and immediately held a review meeting. Yuan Yingzhong said annoyedly: "Only eight or nine enemies, they should have all been eliminated!" After research, they estimated that the enemy would definitely come to collect the corpses, so they set off again the next day. But the cowardly enemies didn't dare to come that day. On the third day, Squad Leader Qian Wencai accepted the instructions from the company commander and led three groups to ambush on the small road on three sides, preparing to attack from three sides. Yuan Yingzhong led his two comrades—Dong Wenwu, etc.—to ambush in the front. At two o'clock in the middle of the night, four enemies came in two batches. Yuan Yingzhong was the first to discover them. He shot the one in front in the dark; after the other two enemies were killed by his two comrades, Yuan Yingzhong fired two more shots and knocked down the last enemy who was trying to escape. He didn't want to kill him, wouldn't it be better to catch him alive and explore the enemy's situation? Who knew that when he opened the emergency kit and wanted to bandage him, the guy died.
    "There's one less?" the squad leader asked.
    A search found the body by the small ditch. This was the enemy that Yuan Yingzhong shot with the first shot in the dark.

    The entire battle lasted less than three minutes, eliminating all four enemies, and also seizing four carbines, while Yuan Yingzhong and his two comrades didn't touch a hair. The price they paid was only nine bullets.
    The old folks in Kava Mountain came to see the enemy's bodies one after another, and asked who killed them? From then on, the legend of "the PLA is a divine army" spread like a myth, and Yuan Yingzhong's wit and bravery also won the praise of the people of all ethnic groups, and they all called him an ambush expert on the border line.

    After suffering several painful lessons, the enemy dared not come to harass anymore. The rumors and offensive of the remnant bandits were completely crushed, and the big and small leaders of all ethnic groups gradually eliminated their worries and leaned towards our Party and our army.

    In the past five years, under the cultivation and education of the Party and the League, Yuan Yingzhong has grown into an excellent fighter in countless battles. He was accepted into the League in 1953. He has made two consecutive merits last year and this year. He can speak very clear Mandarin and write very vivid small articles. But he is not proud at all. A humble person will not forget his roots. He can correctly estimate the weight of the individual in the collective. Whenever he is asked to talk about his model deeds, his first sentence is always:
    "First of all, I must thank our Party and Chairman Mao..."

    国境线上的伏击手
    白朗
    扎拉的童年
    扎拉——这个云南拉祜族贫农的儿子，七岁就死了父亲。父亲给母亲留下来的除了艰难的日月，还有着四个不懂事的儿女——扎拉和他的哥哥、弟、妹们。他们在母亲苦熬苦拽的抚养下，总算活下来了，可是穷苦和劳累不久就把母亲熬煎死了。母亲的死，给孩子们带来了生的危机，酿成了骨肉离散的悲剧，孩子们用母亲仅有的遗产——一口铁锅，和本村（澜沧县富邦区富永村）地主罗伪昌换了一具薄棺把母亲埋葬之后，便各奔西东了！九岁的扎拉也跟那口锅一样地归依了地主，做了罗伪昌的牧童。然而他的命运真还不及那口铁锅呢！
    又瘦又小的扎拉，个儿还赶不上马腿高，可是经他喂养的就有三匹马和三头牛。别的不说，单是放牧和割草，已经远远超过他小小的体力负担了，而他在沉重的劳动之后，还常挨地主恶毒的打骂；吃，吃不饱，穿，穿不暖，有时候，他真不能不羡慕他的伙伴们——牛马的生活了。
    那一带的山高、野兽多。一天，扎拉放的马有一匹被突然袭来的豹子咬死了，这本是不可避免的常事。可是，比野兽还凶狠的罗伪昌是没有人性的，他给了扎拉怎样一顿毒打呵！扎拉是不甘心死在地主手里的，他带着仇恨和鞭伤偷跑出来，去投奔拉祜村一位打猎的老人。老人虽然家境穷苦，而且有一大堆孩子，竟也把无家可归的扎拉收养下了。从此，扎拉不但有了个临时的家，还学会了射击的本领。老人爱扎拉的勇敢和聪明，在扎拉十三岁那年，便交给他一枝打兽的铜炮枪，代替原来打鸟的弓箭。扎拉真高兴啊，他成了个小猎手啦！他当真没有辜负老人的培养和期待，竟用那枝枪先后打死了一只豹子和三只大熊。
    谁想，这样的好日子并没有维持多久，在扎拉十四岁那年，老人就故去了。这以后，扎拉又变成无家可归的孤儿，为了生活，不得不给人放牛牵马。于是，饥寒和虐待又重新落到扎拉的头上！
      扎拉回到了家
    当新中国诞生的喜讯使每一个边远的角落也欢声沸腾的时候，扎拉已经告别了童年时代，长成为一个很英俊的少年了。就在那年冬天，中国共产党领导的游击队来到了边区。扎拉对压迫他剥削他的人们有着切肤的仇恨，可是，一年又一年的小囚徒般的生活，使他没有机会接近能够启发他觉悟的人。因此，他在欢呼解放的同时，也不能不感到迷茫：游击队是从哪儿来的呢？自己被救出牢笼后又到哪儿去呢？
    然而，扎拉不是没有他自己的理想的。他是多么羡慕游击队里扛着枪的小战士呵！扎拉从小就爱枪，如今，已经好几年摸不到枪了；假如自己也能像那些小战士一样背起一枝枪……不，这是梦想！呵，那个小号兵多好玩哪，你看他一本正经地微仰起小脸，一声号响，队伍便集合了——吃饭，开会，操练，锄草，还能学文化呢。假如自己也能……不，这是梦想！扎拉根本就不敢抱任何希望。
    游击队的大队长李小春早就爱上了扎拉，扎拉的满脸聪明和天真，一看就知道是个精明能干的孩子。有一天，他便来和扎拉聊天了。他们聊了很多很多。最后李小春向扎拉提出了一个问题：
    “扎拉，你愿意参加游击队吗？”
    这还用问吗？扎拉太愿意了，太愿意了。扎拉真没想到部队还会收留他。直把他乐得心花都开了，长这么大他真记不得什么时候这样高兴过呵！就从那时起（一九五○年一月），扎拉——这个劳动人民的儿子，真正回到了自己的家，那时他是十七岁。当年六月间，游击队整编扩大，扎拉便正式成了中国人民解放军一名光荣的战斗员。连首长和他商议着，查清了他的汉字姓氏，就把扎拉这个乳名改成了袁应忠。
    捉俘虏
    一九五一年六月，国民党残匪叫嚣着“反攻大陆”，我军引敌深入后，把窜进来的残匪消灭了一部分，也有一部分逃掉了。当时袁应忠所在的二连，驻在靠近拉祜族的地区。连部接到搜山任务后，袁应忠的一个组便奉命连夜出发了，袁应忠带队，很机警地走在最前面。天快亮时，到了东寨。
    忽然，在目力将能达到的地方，隐隐地出现了一个人影，袁应忠立刻紧紧盯住了他。过一忽儿就看清些了：那人披着蓑衣，背着挎包，完全是拉祜族老百姓的打扮；可是，你看他东瞧瞧，西望望，神色多末张惶，步子又是多末匆忙，袁应忠判定，这家伙绝不是个老百姓。他告诉他的战友们隐蔽好，不要过早地惊动他，随后，他自己也隐蔽起来。
    近了，更近了，再过几秒钟，那个鬼鬼祟祟的家伙就要走到袁应忠的跟前了。袁应忠两眼射出仇恨的火花，激动地擎着上了刺刀的枪，一个箭步就冲了上去：
    “缴枪不杀！”
    那家伙一见闪光的刺刀，早吓软了腿，把两手一举，动也不敢动了。
    “快说，干什么的？”袁应忠的刺刀紧抵住那家伙的胸膛。那家伙口吃地说：
    “送…送信……的。”
    一搜挎包，果然有两封信，原来是匪十三中队给匪大队长的密件。袁应忠向俘虏问明了匪大队部的驻处，立刻报告了连长。连长下令全连出动追击。四里地，一恍便到了；十多分钟以后，他们便把一个寨子悄悄围住。当袁应忠领着一排人冲进寨?拥氖焙颍?司??诔苑埂７舜蠖映ひ豢葱问撇幻睿?滔路雇刖拖胩优堋Ｔ?χ掖蠛纫簧??
    “缴枪不杀！哪个跑打死哪个！”这时，狙击手们也围上来，敌人再也不敢动弹了。
    就这样，匪军二十多人便被一网打尽，还缴获了六匹马、二十多头牛、枪枝子弹、金子银子以及标着国民党徽的匪旗。
    发动群众
    云南的黑山，是一百多里的森林地带，也是各兄弟民族杂居的山区；遮天蔽日的原始森林，藏匿着凶顽无比的土匪，黑山的土匪，在历史上就是出名的。一九五二年，当中国人民解放军进入黑山剿匪的时候，人民受到土匪的谣言蒙蔽，谁也不敢和解放军接近。可是，要想肃清为害已久的匪帮，不依靠群众又怎么着手呢？而要想把群众发动起来，首先就必须懂得兄弟民族的语言才成。谁懂得呢？想来想去，拉祜族战士袁应忠就入了选。就这样，袁应忠便把这个严重的任务担当起来，成了发动群众的骨干。
    袁应忠参加部队以后，显然是越来越聪明了。在党的教育下，他多方面的才能，得到了充分的发挥。在战斗中，他有着鹰一样的机警，虎一样的神勇；而在他和群众相处中，他知情达理，却温和亲切得像一只可爱的小羊。平常，他跟一个姑娘似的安详沉静，可是，当他向群众做宣传时，他的话又是那样富于说服力和煽动性。
    这次到黑山，部队刚进老河滩时，一点也不摸底；老百姓也怕解放军，有的跑掉，有的当土匪去了。袁应忠奉了排长的命令到群众中去了解情况。他实在感到没有把握，但完成任务的决心还是很大的。怎样去完成呢？他首先在心里琢磨着接近群众的办法。他不会抽烟，但他出去却带了一盒纸烟。
    他走进姓何的一户人家，那家有个瘫老头子和一个老太婆，六七个孩子唧唧扎扎地。户主人是这家的大儿子，三十多岁。袁应忠一走进去，他吓得掉头就走。袁应忠和颜悦色地把他叫住说：
    “老乡，麻烦你们啦，来，抽枝烟吧！”
    那人露着满脸的疑惑把烟接了过去。袁应忠又说：
    “别怕，老乡，解放军不像蒋匪帮，不偷不抢，不动老百姓的一针一线。不信，你看好啦！”
    那人只呆呆地看着袁应忠，一言未发。
    第二天，袁应忠又去了。除了纸烟，还送了一些针线；针线是当地稀罕的东西。那人一高兴就搭话了。他悄悄地问袁应忠：
    “你是拉祜族的孩子为什么要当‘解放’？‘解放’会杀人的。”
    “哪里的话！”袁应忠亲切地笑了，“‘解放’、拉祜是一家，‘解放’也是老百姓出身，你放心，绝不杀人的。”
    袁应忠的话虽然亲切诚恳，那人还是半信半疑，摇摇头自语似的说：“我就是怕！”
    袁应忠觉得他很老实。便把他和他接触的经过汇报了排长。排长估计这个人可以培养，要袁应忠耐心地去启发教育。果然，排长的估计没有错，当袁应忠第三次去的时候，那人便自然些了。他主动地问道：
    “‘解放’，你叫什么名字？”
    “扎拉。”袁应忠回答。那人又试探着问：
    “扎拉，你怕‘解放’不？”
    “不怕，怕，就不参加了。‘解放’多仁义呵！老何，你见‘解放’打过人吗？”
    “没有。”本来没有嘛，他只看见“解放”帮老百姓做各种各样的活。他沉思了一会儿才吞吐地说：
    “扎拉，我有话跟扎拉说呵！”
    袁应忠听他的口气，看他的神色，就猜准他有什么不敢告人的事，便很热情地说：
    “老何，有什么话都跟扎拉说吧，‘解放’、拉祜是一家人喏！”
    “我有一杆铜炮枪，送给‘解放’吧？要不？”
    “不要，不要，”袁应忠果断地摇头说：“‘解放’枪多的是。你留着打鸟吧。”随后便把带去的礼物：咸盐、毛巾和针线放在老何面前。说给他补助一下生活。
    老何稀罕地摸着那些礼物，感动得嘴唇都发抖了，终于带着激动说出憋了好久的话：
    “扎拉，你可别说，我两个兄弟都到外国去了！”
    袁应忠的心突然一动，但他控制着，不动声色地说：
    “不要紧，他们以后回来还是一家人。”
    “他们是叫国民党拉去当土匪的。扎拉，叫回来才好呵，你可有什么办法吗？”
    “是呵，叫回来才好，让我想想看。”袁应忠隐藏着高兴，安抚了老何，便回到部队汇报并要求任务。
    上级党委批准了他的计划。袁应忠立刻动员老何陪着他的母亲去动员他的兄弟们回来。三天以后，老太太真的把她的两个儿子动员回来了。还捎带着领回来另外五个被拉走的青年和五枝步枪。
    老人家真是多么高兴呵！她感动得竟把准备给瘫老头办丧事的小猪杀掉，硬逼着袁应忠和他的伙伴们吃了一顿新米饭。
    通过这类实例的教育，老河滩的群众就发动起来了。解放军在群众中建立了很高的威信，军民结下了不可分离的友谊。当部队移防，要求群众给提意见时，群众都说：“我们的意见就是你们别走。”男女老幼哭着不放解放军，没有办法，部队就晚走了四天。当他们出发时，有二百多人抢着给他们背背包，一直送出一百多里。以后，老河滩群众知道部队缺青菜，常常赶着牲畜远远地把青菜给他们送来。还送来过两面大红旗呢。
    两次战斗
    正当大雪纷飞的时节，解放军到了西盟区，在一个寨里驻扎下来。部队一到，便搜山、打埋伏，清剿残匪。可是，敌人是非常狡猾的，他们的戒备极严。部队埋伏了几次都落空了。战士们真不服气呵：难道我们就真治不了敌人吗？战士们消灭敌人的心更迫切了。大家纷纷要求任务，连炊事员、司号员也不甘落后。
    是二月二日（一九五三年）那天晚上，袁应忠的班长赵云德带领着他们全班去国境线上的南溪河畔打埋伏。天冷，路滑，夜是漆黑的，但杀敌的雄心鼓舞着他们，谁也没感到冷，走起来一个拉着一个，虽说艰苦，也并不感到怎么吃力。半夜，就在小山上的树林里埋伏下来。
    天刚亮，班长忽然发现对面山坳处走过来十几个人，相距二百多公尺，班长眼花，看不清楚，他把袁应忠叫过来说：“你仔细看看，那边走过来的是敌人还是老乡？”
    袁应忠是善于辨别敌友的。他一看走路的样子就断定准是敌人。于是他和班长迅速地滑下山坡冲到大路边，把子弹推上了膛。还没埋伏好，敌人的脚步声就响过来了。袁应忠和班长敏捷地伏到乱草丛中，动也不动；一动，乱草就要发出很大的沙沙声，会打草惊蛇的。不一会儿，一个敌人缩头缩脑地走过来，袁应忠一伸手就能够抓到他。但是班长不让他动，说这是尖兵，别惊动他，后面一定还有多的。袁应忠只好按捺住激动，拧开手溜弹盖等着。这时候，有两个拉祜村的姑娘迎着敌人走来了，她们一眼就看见伏在草里的袁应忠。姑娘们对他笑了，他连忙使了个眼色，姑娘们马上会意地收起笑容，小声哼着“东方红”若无其事地走向前去。
    “马哑（姑娘），‘解放’有没有？”这是对面走来的敌人凶恶的声音。
    “马住！（没有的意思）”姑娘一边从容地回答，一边和敌人擦肩走过去。
    敌人狠狠地咒骂着姑娘，骂着骂着，就到了袁应忠的跟前。可是真糟糕呵，七个狡猾的敌人竟捆绑带着四个老百姓，一打，不是把老百姓也伤害了吗？只好又放过了。
    最后，班长重新布置了任务：把全班分成两组，准备前后夹击。第一组尾随敌后，第二组绕到敌人的前面去。袁应忠分到第一组，做尖兵。他走出不远，就看见一个藏在远远草里的敌人。袁应忠跳过去大喊一声：“缴枪不杀！”喊声未落，一梭子弹就从他的肩头嗖嗖穿过去，他敏捷地还击了两枪，那家伙就像死狗似的倒在血水里了。一搜查，原来是个匪军的中队长。
    前后的八、九个敌人一听枪声，全乱了阵，他们把抓来的老乡逼着翻下山坡，正想逃走，狙击手们便赶到了。一阵猛烈的射击，敌人死的死，伤的伤，有的连滚带爬地逃走了。这次伏击，也不能不算是个胜利，可是他们还嫌不够，马上开了检讨会。袁应忠懊恼地说：“只八、九个敌人，应该全部报销才对呵！”经过研究，他们估计敌人一定要来收尸，第二天便又出动了。可是怕死的敌人这天没敢来。第三天，七班长钱文才接受了连首长的指示，带着三个组分三面到小路埋伏下来，准备三面夹击。袁应忠带着他的两个战友——董文武等埋伏在最前面。到下半夜两点钟，就有四个敌人分两批来了，袁应忠第一个发现了他们，他在黑古影里冲着前面的一个就是一枪；当另外两个敌人被他的两个战友打死了以后，袁应忠又连发两枪打倒了企图逃跑的最后一个敌人。他本不想打死他，捉到活的不是还可以探探敌情吗？谁知，当他打开救急包刚想给他包扎，那家伙便断了气。
    “还少一个呢？”班长问。
    一找，在小沟边找到了尸首。这就是袁应忠在黑古影里，第一枪打的那个敌人。
    这次战斗总共不到三分钟，把四个敌人全部消灭，还缴了四枝卡宾枪，而袁应忠和他的两个战友一根毫毛也没碰倒，他们付出的代价只不过是九颗子弹。
    佧瓦山的老乡们，纷纷来看敌人的尸首，还问是谁打死的？从此，“解放军是神兵”的传说，像神话似的流传开来，而袁应忠的机智和勇敢也博得了各族人民的赞颂，都管他叫国境线上的伏击手。
    敌人受了几次惨痛的教训，再也不敢来骚扰了。残匪的谣言攻势彻底被粉碎，各民族的大小头人也逐渐消除了顾虑向我党我军靠拢了。
    五年来，袁应忠在党、团培养教育下，在无数次的战斗中，已经成长为一个优秀的战斗员，一九五三年就被接受入团。他在去年和今年连续立了两次功。他能说很清楚的普通话，写很生动的小文章。但他一点也不骄傲，谦虚的人是不会忘本的，他能够很正确地估计个人在集体中所占的分量。每当请他谈谈他的模范事迹时，他的第一句话总是说：
    “首先得感谢我们的党和毛主席……”
