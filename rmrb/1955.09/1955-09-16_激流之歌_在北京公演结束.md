    “激流之歌”在北京公演结束
    描写世界工人运动的著名影片“激流之歌”在北京公映结束，受到广大观众热烈的欢迎。从八日至十二日，有八万五千四百多观众到六家电影院观赏了这部影片，观众上座率突破了北京市半年来放映纪录影片的最高纪录。
    北京许多工厂的工人集体看过这部影片后，举行了座谈会，讨论影片的内容，得到很大的鼓舞。北京市工会联合会曾举行了电影预映会，并由市工会联合会宣传部负责人向各基层工会干部分析了电影的内容。
    石景山钢铁厂、京西矿务局、国营北京第一棉纺织厂和北京钢铁工业学院等在本单位放映了这部影片。有些厂矿在放映时，工会组织的负责人并讲话说明这部影片在我国映出的意义。现在，流动电影放映队正在京西矿区、建筑工地放映这部影片。
