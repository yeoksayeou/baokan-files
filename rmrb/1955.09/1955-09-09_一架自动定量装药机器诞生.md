    An Automatic Quantitative Medicine Filling Machine is Born
    Workers such as Wan Chunjie from the Lanzhou Biological Products Institute have created an automatic quantitative dispensing machine. This is a machine for automatically dispensing a fixed amount of medicine. When staff operate the button on this machine, the copper disk engraved with graduations on the upper part of the machine immediately starts to rotate. Then, they align the small rubber tube below the machine with an empty medicine bottle, and the medicine pours into the bottle with accurate measurements. The efficiency of dispensing medicine is eight times higher than the previous method of dispensing the same volume of medicine using a burette. Moreover, the burette dispensing method often resulted in errors in measurement, leading to significant rework and waste.
    Wan Chunjie, a young worker and Communist Party member in the Lanzhou Biological Products Institute's dispensing room, began organizing a research team with Wang Quan, Pan Yuxiang, and other staff members in July of last year to design this scientific dispensing machine. They made major and minor modifications to the drawings eleven times before creating a very complex blueprint. At that time, they could not find a factory to manufacture the machine. With the encouragement of the Party organization and administrative leadership of the Biological Products Institute, Wan Chunjie disassembled parts from old machines to assemble them. When some parts could not be installed, he changed the design. After repeated efforts, they finally succeeded in manufacturing it with the help of Wang Quan, Li Yongde, and others.

    一架自动定量装药机器诞生
    兰州生物制品所工人万纯洁等创造了一架自动定量分装机。这是一种自动定量装药的机器。工作人员操纵这种机器上的电钮，机器上边刻着度数的铜盘就马上转动起来，接着再把机器下面的小胶皮管对准空药瓶，药就倾入瓶里，分量十分正确。装药效率比过去用滴定管分装法装同等容量药品的效率提高了八倍。而且用滴定管分装法在分量方面还经常要发生错误，返工浪费很大。
    兰州生物制品所分装室青年工人、共产党员万纯洁去年七月开始和王全、潘玉香等工作人员组织了一个研究小组设计这个科学的分装机器。他们对图样曾经作了大小十一次的修改，才画成一张很复杂的图样。当时找不到承制机器的工厂，万纯洁在生物制品所的党组织和行政领导方面的鼓励下，把旧机器上的零件拆下来配装，有些零件安不上便改变设计。经过反复努力，终于在王全、李永德等人的帮助下制造成功。（新华社）
