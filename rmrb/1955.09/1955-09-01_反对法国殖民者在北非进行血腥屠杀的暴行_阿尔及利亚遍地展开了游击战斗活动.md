Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 31st: The French government announced on the 30th that it was extending the scope of the "state of emergency law" to the whole of Algeria. According to this law, the French authorities in Algeria can freely adopt high-handed measures, impose extremely strict censorship on newspapers, restrict the movement of residents, conduct searches, and exile residents.

France has taken these measures to deal with the increasingly widespread activities of the Algerian people's guerrillas. The Paris newspaper "Volontaires" said on the 30th that guerrilla warfare had actually spread throughout the entire territory of Algeria. The newspaper pointed out: However, the result of the suppression is only to provide new recruits for the Algerian guerrillas. "L'Humanité" reported that due to the so-called "mopping-up operations" carried out by the French authorities, Algerian farmers had abandoned their homes and fled to the mountains. The encirclement and suppression troops advanced through empty villages.

In Morocco, France is continuing to reinforce its troops. On the 30th, another 2,500 French troops, originally stationed in West Germany, arrived in Casablanca. On the same day, 117 armored vehicles were also transported there.

At the same time as the French army launched a major offensive against the Berber people of Morocco in central Morocco, the colonial authorities carried out mass arrests. According to Agence France-Presse, 2,500 Moroccans were arrested in Khenifra alone. They were tried in Rabat on the 29th.

    反对法国殖民者在北非进行血腥屠杀的暴行
    阿尔及利亚遍地展开了游击战斗活动
    新华社三十一日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府三十日宣布把“紧急状态法”的施行范围扩展到整个阿尔及利亚。根据这个法令，阿尔及利亚法国当局可以随便采取高压手段，对报纸进行极严格的检查，限制居民的移动，进行搜查和流放居民。
    法国采取这种措置是为了要对付阿尔及利亚人民游击队近来日益扩大的活动。巴黎“义勇军报”在三十日说，游击队的战斗活动实际上已经遍及阿尔及利亚全部领土。这家报纸指出：但是，镇压的结果只是使阿尔及利亚的游击队得到新的补充。“人道报”报道说，由于法国当局进行了所谓“扫荡战”，阿尔及利亚农民都抛弃了家园，逃到山里去了。围剿部队是通过空无一人的村庄向前推进的。
    在摩洛哥，法国在继续增兵。三十日，又有原来驻在西德的法军二千五百人到达卡萨布兰卡。同日还有一百十七辆装甲车运到。
    同法军在摩洛哥中部对摩洛哥的柏伯尔人大举进攻同时，殖民当局进行了大逮捕。据法新社消息，仅在肯尼弗拉被捕的摩洛哥人就有二千五百人。他们二十九日在拉巴特受审。
