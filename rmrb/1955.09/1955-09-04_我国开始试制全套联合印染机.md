    China Begins Trial Production of Complete Set of Combined Printing and Dyeing Machines
    A complete set of combined printing and dyeing machines is being trial-produced at the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory. Trial production of the most complex components of this printing and dyeing machine began in mid-August.
    In the past, the printing and dyeing machines used by China's textile industry were all imported from abroad. This is the first time that China has trial-produced a complete set of combined printing and dyeing machines. After the successful trial production of the complete set of combined printing and dyeing machines, they can be supplied to China's newly built textile printing and dyeing factories, allowing the vast number of urban and rural people to print and dye more and better colored cloth and printed cloth.
    In June of this year, the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory organized technical cadres to visit relevant factories in Shanghai to learn about the processing technology and manufacturing technology of special parts of printing and dyeing machines, and conducted a comprehensive study of the drawings of the complete set of printing and dyeing machines. After repeated research, the overall trial production schedule was established in mid-August. (Xinhua News Agency)

    我国开始试制全套联合印染机
    一种全套的联合印染机正在国营郑州纺织机械厂试制。这种印染机上的最复杂的部件的试制工作已在八月中旬开始。
    过去中国纺织工业所用的印染机，都是从国外进口的。试制全套的联合印染机，在中国还是第一次。全套的联合印染机试制成功以后，就可以供应中国新建的纺织印染工厂，给广大城乡人民印染更多更好的色布和花布。
    郑州纺织机械厂在今年六月间曾组织技术干部到上海各有关工厂参观，学习印染机的加工工艺和特殊机件的制造技术，并对成套印染机的图纸进行了全面的研究。经过反复研究后，在八月中旬订出了总的试制计划进度表。　（新华社）
