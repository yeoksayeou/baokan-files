    Vietnamese Literary and Art Development

    Liu Zhonglu, Head of the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe

    From 1884, when French colonialists occupied Vietnam, until the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, Vietnamese literature and art were consistently influenced by feudal rulers and colonialists. The literature and art of that time were mainly slavish and decadent, serving imperialism and the ruling class. However, throughout those eighty years, there existed a progressive and unyielding national literature and art. The patriotic movements against French colonialists, such as those led by Phan Đình Phùng and Phan Bội Châu, and the anti-tax movements, all embodied this unyielding spirit. The poems created by Vietnamese patriots and the people during the anti-tax movements were widely circulated among the people. Since the establishment of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, Vietnamese literature and art have had a new direction, beginning to serve the masses under the leadership of the proletariat and becoming strongly militant. In the struggles of the "Nghe-Tinh Soviets" and the "Nam Kỳ Uprising," we were left with many valuable literary and artistic works created by workers and peasants. These works were the crystallization of revolutionary fighters, and it can be said that prisons were schools for poetry creation at that time. Tố Hữu, a young poet who has a great influence on Vietnamese youth today and the author of the poetry collection "Viet Bac," created his poems in prison at that time and won the love of the masses.

    Since the August Revolution and the outbreak of the national resistance, Vietnamese literature and art have entered a new stage of development. The vast majority of Vietnamese literary and art workers participated in the August Revolution. After the outbreak of the national resistance, they immediately and bravely joined the ranks of the resistance, engaging in arduous and glorious long-term battles alongside the people and soldiers in the front and rear. In the early stages of the resistance, many songs and poems emerged, serving the people's struggle in a timely manner. Examples include "Eliminate Fascism" and "Vietnamese Soldiers," which were songs that appeared in the early stages of the revolution and resistance. It can be said that a part of Vietnamese literature and art during this period was closely integrated with the Vietnamese revolution and resistance. At that time, the Party put forward the policy of scientific, popular, and nationalized literature and art to inspire the people's patriotism and hatred for the enemy. This was because, despite the advantage of being able to serve every stage of the resistance in a timely manner, the line between the enemy and ourselves was not very clear for some literary and art workers, because they did not have much contact with the actual struggle, so many old and romantic sentiments remained in their works. During this period, the troops, workers, and peasants fought the enemy, produced, and engaged in literary and artistic work at the same time. At that time, the creations of the people and soldiers in the enemy-occupied areas had a clear fighting spirit, mass character, and national character, thereby further consolidating the people's literature and art at that time. With the development of the resistance, a group of young literary and art workers emerged among the masses. At that time, our literary and art workers put forward the slogan of learning from mass literature and art to enhance their fighting will. At the same time, the literary and artistic works of fraternal countries, especially those of China, also penetrated into our masses and had a great influence on Vietnamese literature and art. Here, special mention should be made of Zhao Shuli's works.

    However, it was only after our literary and art workers participated in rectification and training, mobilizing the masses to reduce rent and interest, and land reform movements that their positions of love and hatred were more thoroughly resolved. Literary and art workers who participated in mobilizing the masses for land reform gained the opportunity to participate in actual struggles, thus being able to further understand the peasants, change their thoughts and feelings, and receive better training. The national art exhibition clearly demonstrated that our literature and art have developed from the "utopian" creative methods that were divorced from reality to the point where they can correctly reflect the people's struggles and lives today. Many young writers' novels and poems have been welcomed by the masses. Next, the Vietnam Literary and Art Association launched a movement to collect and sort out the national musical heritage. Literary and art workers went deeper into the masses, who contained a rich national musical heritage, than before. This movement, which began in early 1954 and lasted until the end of 1954, universally unfolded the work of collecting folk songs in the army from the regimental level to the entire army, and among the people from the village, commune, district to the central level. The songs that were excavated were sorted out in a timely manner and immediately used to serve the people and the front lines. At the same time, many dances circulating among the people were also sorted out in the same way.

    Nine weeks after taking over the capital Hanoi, that is, three days before the eighth anniversary of the national resistance, the Vietnam National Art Troupe Observation and Performance Conference opened. The observation performance included 1,271 people and 26 art troupes from 26 ethnic groups. Among them were art troupes from the South. These art troupes had carried out heroic struggles in the extremely difficult southern guerrilla areas. Sometimes, its members could only fill their stomachs with taro and wild vegetables. At that time, the slogan "Every member must be a comprehensive, self-reliant worker" was put forward. They often set up stages not far from the enemy's strongholds to perform for the masses. They used grass mats as curtains, forests as backdrops, torches as lighting, and the audience had to stand in the mud to watch their performances. Some art troupes, such as the Thừa Thiên Art Troupe, suffered heavy sacrifices in the fight against the enemy, and only two lonely people are left today; and the Lao Hà Art Troupe has all heroically sacrificed. Now, both of these art troupes have been posthumously awarded the War of Resistance Medal by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    The observation and performance was held in a total of 29 sessions, with an audience of 170,000 people, including people from Saigon and Hai Phong (Hai Phong had not yet been liberated at that time). The programs performed included singing, dancing, drama, musical instrument performances, and so on. Most of these programs embodied a love of labor, a desire for peace and unity, as well as the people's fighting spirit and the revolutionary optimism of the troops. While performing ethnic programs, programs from fraternal countries such as "Picking Tea and Catching Butterflies" and "Red Army Dance" were also performed and were very popular among the masses. The National Art Troupe Observation and Performance Conference left a good impression on the people of the newly liberated areas. They said, "Our own literature and art are extremely healthy literature and art, which are completely different from the corrupt and degenerate literature and art left by the enemy." Therefore, many people overcame many difficulties from Hai Phong and Saigon to watch the performance. Some people decided not to return to the South after watching the conference.

    Through the National Art Troupe Observation and Performance Conference, our literary and art workers have more clearly realized the correctness of the literary and art line led by the Vietnam Workers' Party, and that the excavation of national heritage is in line with the wishes of the masses. However, there are still many shortcomings in our literature and art, which are far behind the urgent needs of revolutionary struggles and the masses of people. In general, the fighting content of literary and artistic works is not strong enough, the quantity is still small, and many dance programs have not been well processed and adapted. At the same time, in the work of excavating national heritage, we have not been able to clearly distinguish between the progressive and backward aspects of the national heritage.

    The Vietnam Workers' Party has put forward such tasks to Vietnamese literary and art workers: they must go deep into the masses and actual struggles, study the Party's policies and cultivate their own fighting will, collect and sort out national heritage, and learn from the valuable experiences of fraternal countries, especially the experiences of the Soviet Union and China, to further improve our artistic level. At the same time, they are required to transform their thinking, correct their work style, and cultivate their fighting will, so as to fully realize President Ho Chi Minh's teaching: A literary and art worker must be a fighter on the cultural front.

    The Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe, which visited China and other fraternal countries this time, is composed of personnel drawn from various units in Vietnam. Some of them are from the old liberated areas, some are from the newly liberated areas. There are northerners and southerners; some are actors from military art troupes, some are actors from people's art troupes, and some are actors from private opera troupes, but most of them participated in the War of Resistance.

    Some female comrades were only six or seven years old girls when they left the enemy-occupied areas with their mothers and evacuated to the countryside. Today, when they return, they have become female art troupe members. They are almost all young people who have only been in the art troupe for a short time. They have not received any specialized school training. Most of the dance and music are self-taught and self-trained in their work. At present, as in the War of Resistance period, they are not yet specialized. The actors have to do a lot of work. Sometimes they dance, sometimes they sing and act, and sometimes they have to do some other things.

    During the War of Resistance, sometimes they had to be divided into small groups of three or five people to go deep into the army, factories, and rural areas to perform for the masses, guide the people to sing and dance, and write ballads. At the same time, they also learned from the people to improve their own thinking and art. Some people followed the troops to participate in major battles to serve the troops, and some went to serve the civil workers or to the areas where the masses were mobilized to carry out land reform and rent reduction to serve the land reform and rent reduction movement. Some people endured various hardships and went to the southern guerrilla areas to engage in activities.

    After the restoration of peace, some efforts have been made in specialized business, but the technology has not been fully cultivated, and there are still many shortcomings. This visit to fraternal countries for performance can contribute to enhancing the mutual understanding between the Vietnamese and Chinese people and the people of fraternal countries on the one hand, and can further learn from the artistic experiences of fraternal countries to improve our own thinking and art, and continue to fight alongside the people of our country for the unification and independence of the motherland.

### 越南文艺发展的道路

    越南文艺发展的道路
    越南人民歌舞团团长　刘仲卢
    从一八八四年法国殖民者侵占越南起，直到一九三○年印度支那共产党诞生时为止，越南的文艺
  一直受到封建统治者和殖民者的影响。当时的文艺主要是为帝国主义和统治阶级服务的奴化的和堕落的文艺。但是，整整八十年来，还存在着一种进步的、不屈不挠的民族文艺。潘廷逢和潘佩珠等反对法国殖民者的爱国运动和反税收运动等都体现了这种不屈不挠的精神。越南爱国者和人民在反税收运动中所创作的诗歌在人民中间得到了广泛的流传。自从一九三○年印度支那共产党成立以后，越南的文艺才有了新的方向，开始在无产阶级的领导下面向人民大众，并且开始带有强烈的战斗性。在“宜安苏维埃”和“南圻起义”的斗争中，给我们留下了许多出自工农之手的有价值的文艺作品。这些作品都是革命战士的结晶，可以说那时监狱就是诗歌创作的学校。现在在越南青年中有着巨大影响的年轻诗人、诗集“越北”的作者素友，当时就曾在监狱中创作自己的诗歌，并且博得了群众的爱戴。
    自从八月革命和全国抗战爆发之后，越南文艺又进入了新的发展阶段。越南绝大多数的文艺工作者都参与了八月革命。全国抗战爆发以后，他们又立即奋勇地参加了抗战的行列，在前线和后方，同人民和战士并肩进行艰苦而又光荣的长期战斗。在抗战的初期就出现了许多的歌曲和诗篇，及时地为人民的战斗事业服务。如“消灭法西斯”和“越南战士”这些都是革命和抗战初期出现的歌曲。可以说，这个时期的越南文艺，一部分已经同越南的革命和抗战紧密地结合起来了。当时党提出了文艺科学化、大众化和民族化的方针，以启发人民的爱国心和对敌人的仇恨。这是因为：尽管当时具有能够及时为抗战的每一个阶段服务的优点，但是一部分文艺工作者的敌我界线还不十分明确，因为他们同实际斗争接触得还不多，所以在自己的作品中还残留着许多旧的和浪漫主义的情感。就在这个时期，部队、工人和农民一面抗击敌人，一面生产，一面又从事文艺工作。那时敌后地区的人民、战士的创作已带有很鲜明的斗争性、群众性和民族性，因而进
  一步巩固了当时的人民文艺。随着抗战的发展，在群众中出现了一批年青的文艺工作者。那时我们的文艺工作者已提出了向群众文艺学习以增强自己的战斗意志的口号。同时，各兄弟国家的文艺作品，特别是中国的文艺作品也深入到了我们的群众中间，并对我们越南的文艺起了很大的影响，这里特别要提到的是赵树理的作品。
    但是只有当我们的文艺工作者参加了整训、发动群众减租减息和土地改革的运动以后，他们的憎爱立场才得到了比较彻底的解决。参加发动群众进行土地改革的文艺工作者，获得了参加实际斗争的机会，因而能够进一步地了解农民，使自己的思想情感有了改变，并且得到了较好的锻炼。在全国举行的美术展览会就很清楚地证明了：我们的文艺已从脱离实际的“空想”的创作方法发展到今天的已能正确反映人民的战斗和生活的地步。许多青年作家的小说和诗歌受到了群众的欢迎。接着，越南文艺会又发动了搜集和整理民族音乐遗产的运动，文艺工作者比从前更深入到了蕴藏着丰富的民族音乐遗产的群众中去。这一运动从一九五四年初开始到一九五四年底为止，在部队中从团部一直到全军，在人民中从村、社、区一直到中央，普遍地展开了搜集民间歌曲的工作，被发掘出来的歌曲得到了及时的整理，并立即用来为人民和前线服务。与此同时，许多流传在民间的舞蹈也得到了同样的整理。
    在接管首都河内的九个星期以后，也就是在全国抗战八周年纪念日的前三天，越南全国文工团观摩会演大会开幕了。参加观摩演出的包括有二十六个民族的一千二百七十一人和二十六个文工团。其中还有来自南部的文工团。这些文工团曾在极为艰苦的南部游击区里进行了英勇的斗争，有的时候它的成员只能用芋头和野菜来充饥。当时曾提出了“每一个团员必须是全面自力更生的劳动者”的口号。他们常常在离敌人据点不远的地方搭起舞台为群众演出。他们以草席为幕，以树林为布景，火把为灯光，而观众也必须站在泥泞中来看他们的表演。有些文工团，像承天文工团，在对敌斗争中蒙受了重大的牺牲，今天只剩下孤零零的两个人了；又如劳河文工团则更已全部壮烈牺牲。现在这两个文工团都已被越南民主共和国政府追认发给抗战勋章。
    观摩会演总共演出了二十九场，观众达十七万人，其中包括来自西贡和海防（当时海防还没有解放）的人民。所演出的节目包括有歌、舞、剧、乐器演奏等等。在这些节目中大部分都体现了热爱劳动，渴望和平、统一的意志，以及人民的战斗精神和部队的革命乐观主义。在演出民族节目的同时，也演出了各兄弟国家的节目，如“采茶扑蝶”“红军舞”等，很受群众的欢迎。全国文工团观摩会演大会对新解放区的人民留下了良好的印象。他们说：“我们自己的文艺是极其健康的文艺，它和敌人留下来的腐化、堕落的文艺是完全不同的。”因此有很多人从海防、西贡克服重重困难赶来观看演出。有的人在看了会演之后，决心不再回南方去了。
    通过全国文工团观摩会演，使得我们文艺工作者更清楚地认识到越南劳动党所领导的文艺路线的正确，发掘民族遗产符合群众的愿望。但我们的文艺还是存在着不少缺点，它还远远赶不上革命斗争和人民群众的迫切需要。总的说来，文艺作品的战斗内容还不够强而有力，数量还很少，很多舞蹈节目还没有很好地加工改编。同时在发掘民族遗产的工作中还没有能够显著地分清民族遗产的进步面和其落后面。
    越南劳动党已经向越南文艺工作者提出了这样的任务：必须深入群众和实际斗争，学习党的政策和培养自己的战斗意志，搜集和整理民族遗产，学习各兄弟国家的宝贵经验，特别是苏联和中国的经验，以进一步提高我们的艺术水平。同时要求文艺工作者改造自己的思想，端正作风和培养战斗意志，以充分实现胡主席的教导：一个文艺工作者必  须是文化战线上的战士。
    这次到中国和其他兄弟国家访问的越南人民歌舞团，是由越南各种不同的单位抽调出来的人员组成的。他们中间有的是来自老解放区，有的是来自新解放区。有北方的，也有南方的；有的是部队文工团的演员，有的是人民文工团的演员，有的是私人歌剧团的演员，但大部分人都参加了抗战。
    有的女同志在跟母亲离开敌占区、疏散到乡下去时还是六、七岁的小姑娘，今天回来时已成为一个女文工团员。他们差不多都是年青人，参加文工团的时间还很短。他们还没有受过任何专门的学校训练。舞蹈和音乐大部分都是在工作中自学自练出来的，目前仍与抗战时期一样，还没有专业化，演员要做很多的工作，有时跳舞，有时歌唱和演戏，有时还要兼做一些其他的事。
    在抗战时期中，有时他们必须分为三、五个人一个小组深入到军队、工厂和农村中去为群众演出，引导人民唱歌，跳舞，并编写歌谣，同时也向人民学习，以提高自己的思想和艺术。有些人跟随着部队参加各大战役为部队服务，也有些人去为民工或到发动群众进行土改、减租的地区去为土改和减租运动服务，有些人忍受了各种困苦，到南部游击地区活动。
    和平恢复之后，在专门业务方面已作了一些努力，但技术还没有得到充分的培养，缺点还很多，这次到各兄弟国家进行访问演出，一方面可为增进越南同中国和各兄弟国家人民之间的互相了解贡献一部分力量，一面又可进一步学习各兄弟国家的文艺经验，以提高我们自己的思想和艺术，继续与我国人民一道为祖国的统一和独立而斗争。
