    Accumulated Teaching Instruments Should Be Transferred to Units in Need
    To the Editor:
    When the Hebei Province Veterans' Rapid Completion Middle School was established in the winter of 1952, it sent people to Beijing and Tianjin to purchase teaching equipment worth over 15,000 yuan, including microscopes, electric incubators, human body models, fetal models, plant specimens, and mechanics and electricity experimental instruments. In fact, at that time, the school only had two preparatory middle school classes, and the rest were primary school classes, so these instruments were rarely used. In May 1953, the Veterans' School was changed to a two-year rapid completion junior high school, and courses such as physics, chemistry, and biology were cancelled, making this large batch of instruments and equipment even more useless.
    For more than two years, many teachers have repeatedly suggested that since the stockpiled instruments and equipment are not needed, they should be reported to higher authorities and transferred to units in need. However, the school leaders have always ignored this correct opinion. Last year, when the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Education sent people to the school to inspect the work, some teachers also raised this opinion to the inspectors, but the school leaders used the excuse of "they will be useful in the future" and still did not report the instruments for disposal.
    We believe that the school's leaders should overcome departmentalism and allow the stockpiled instruments to play their due role as soon as possible.

### 应该把积存的教学仪器移交给需用单位

    应该把积存的教学仪器移交给需用单位编辑同志：
    河北省荣军速成中学在一九五二年冬季成立的时候，派人到北京、天津采购了价值一万五千元以上的教学用具，其中有显微镜、电气温箱、人体模型、胎儿模型、植物标本和力学、电学实验仪器等。其实，当时学校里只有两个中学预备班，其它都是小学班，很少用得着这些仪器。一九五三年五月荣军学校改为两年制的速成初级中学，取消了物理、化学、生物等课程，这一大批仪器设备就更用不着了。
    两年多来，许多教师曾多次提过意见：积压的仪器设备既然用不着，应该呈报上级移交给需用单位。但学校领导人员对这种正确的意见，总是置之不理。去年内务部、教育部派人来校检查工作的时候，也有教师向检查人员提过这个意见，而学校领导人员却用“将来还有用”作理由，仍不把仪器上报处理。
    我们认为，这个学校的领导人员应该克服本位主义思想，使积压的仪器早日发挥应有的作用。
