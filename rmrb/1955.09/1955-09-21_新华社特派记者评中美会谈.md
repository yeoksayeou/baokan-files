Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, September 20th, Chen Shi-wu, special correspondent for this agency, reports: With the Sino-American ambassadorial talks reaching an agreement on the first item on the agenda—the repatriation of civilians from both sides—world opinion has unanimously expressed its welcome, considering this a new event in Sino-American relations since the founding of the People’s Republic of China six years ago. It not only creates a good start for improving Sino-American relations in the future, but also will play its due positive role in easing tensions in the Far East.

Now that the first item on the agenda has been agreed upon, according to common sense and international conference practice, the ambassadorial talks should immediately enter the second item on the agenda, namely, the discussion of other practical issues over which the two sides have disputes. And it is precisely on the second item on the agenda that the sincerity of both sides in seeking a resolution to the disputes existing between the two countries will be further tested. World opinion after the agreement on the first item on the agenda shows that not only is the time ripe for entering the second item on the agenda, but it is also what the people of all countries unanimously and urgently expect.

However, at the fifteenth meeting held on September 14, which was the first meeting after the agreement was reached on the first item on the agenda, the attitude of the American side did not meet this unanimous expectation of peace-loving people all over the world, including the American people. After the adjournment of the meeting that day, the two delegations, in accordance with the common agreement in the meeting, announced to the press that Chinese Ambassador Wang Bingnan had proposed at the meeting that the issues that China currently believes should be discussed and resolved under the second item on the agenda are: 1. The issue of lifting the embargo; 2. The issue of preparing for higher-level Sino-American negotiations. American Ambassador Johnson mentioned the "issue of the implementation of the agreement" at the meeting. The fact that the American side did not mention a word about the second item on the agenda at the time aroused suspicion and incomprehension among reporters from various countries waiting outside the conference room. However, by dusk of the same day, the American delegation actually issued a written statement to the press, unilaterally publishing the content of the meeting on that day without the agreement of both parties and without the American delegation requesting publication, saying that the American ambassador stated at the meeting that it was "too early" to discuss other issues before the agreement on the repatriation of civilians was fulfilled.

This raises two questions.

First, the American delegation violated the common agreement on news releases made by both sides at the beginning of the talks, which stipulated that the content of the talks should be released to the press only after being agreed upon by both parties at the meeting. This agreement was made based on the suggestion of the American side.

Second, this unilateral announcement by the American side openly shows their intention to delay the discussion of the second item on the agenda, and the fact that this Sino-American talk will not only discuss the issue of civilian repatriation, but also discuss other practical issues over which the two sides have disputes, was first proposed by the American side.

This inconsistent approach of American diplomacy has aroused people's concerns.

In order to clarify the confusion caused by this unilateral action by the American side, the spokesperson of the Chinese delegation issued a written statement to the press at the League of Nations Building here on the afternoon of the 19th, pointing out that the American side's claim that it was "too early" to discuss the second item on the agenda was untenable. The spokesperson of the Chinese delegation pointed out: If it is said that the discussion of the second item on the agenda can only be entered after the agreement on the first item on the agenda has been fully implemented, then since there are many Chinese nationals in the United States, it will be a long-term issue for all Chinese in the United States who are willing to return to China to return to China, and therefore Sino-American talks will not be able to proceed at all during this long period. This argument is unreasonable and has no precedent in international conferences. The Chinese delegation reiterated in the statement that the Chinese side is abiding by the agreement it has reached. The fact that American nationals have recently begun to leave China one after another and arrive in Hong Kong is proof. The issue of faithfully fulfilling the agreement does not arise on the Chinese side but on the American side. Many Chinese who applied to return to China but were prevented from doing so, as acknowledged by the US side at the meeting, have not returned to China since the talks began in early August.

People believe that the time required to implement the agreement must not become an obstacle to continuing the discussion of the second item on the agenda. The Sino-American talks should immediately discuss the "embargo issue" and the "issue of preparing for higher-level Sino-American negotiations" proposed by Ambassador Wang Bingnan at the last meeting. Not discussing or delaying the discussion of the second item on the agenda is not feasible. Only by immediately discussing and resolving these issues can we contribute to improving Sino-American relations, easing tensions in the Far East, and strengthening world peace.

    新华社特派记者评中美会谈
    新华社日内瓦二十日电　本社特派记者陈适五报道：中美两国大使级会谈在关于第一项议程——双方平民回国问题的讨论达成协议以后，世界各国舆论一致表示欢迎，认为这是自从中华人民共和国成立六年来中美关系中的一个新的事件。它不仅为改进今后中美两国关系造成了一个良好的开端，而且也将在缓和远东紧张局势的道路上起它应有的积极影响。
    第一项议程既已达成协议，根据常识和国际会议的惯例，大使级会谈应该立即进入第二项议程，即双方有所争执的其他实际问题的讨论。而且正是在第二项议程上，双方对谋求解决两国间存在的争端一事是不是具有诚意，将受到进一步的考验。第一项议程达成协议后的世界舆论表明，进入第二项议程的讨论不但时机已经成熟，而且也是各国人民一致迫切期待的。
    但是，在九月十四日举行的第十五次会议上，也就是在第一项议程达成协议后的第一次会议上，美国方面的态度是不符合全世界爱好和平的人民、包括美国人民在内的这种一致的期望的。在这一天的会议休会后，双方代表团根据会议中共同的约定，向新闻界宣布中国王炳南大使在会上提出中国方面目前认为在第二项议程下应予讨论和解决的问题是：一、取消禁运问题；二、准备更高一级的中美谈判问题。美国约翰逊大使在会议上谈到“协议的实施问题”。美国方面对第二项议程只字未提一节当时就引起了等候在会议室外的各国记者的疑惑不解。可是，到了当天黄昏的时候，美国代表团方面竟然又向新闻界散发书面声明，片面地公布了当日会议上未经双方约定、美国代表团也并未要求公布的会谈内容，说美国大使在会上提出，在关于遣返平民的协议得到履行之前，讨论其他问题“为时过早”。
    这里就引起了两个问题。
    第一，美国代表团违反了会谈一开始时双方所作出的关于新闻发布问题的共同约定，这个约定规定向新闻界公布会谈内容，必须在会上经双方同意后进行。这个约定还是根据美国方面的建议作出的。
    第二，美国方面的这一片面的公告不惜公开地显示他们想拖延讨论第二项议程的意图，而这次中美会谈除了讨论平民回国问题外，也要讨论双方有所争执的其他实际问题一点，正是美国方面首先提出的。
    美国外交的这种出尔反尔的作法，已经引起了人们的疑虑。
    为了澄清美国方面这一片面行动造成的混乱，中国代表团发言人十九日下午在此间国联大厦向新闻界发表了书面声明，指出美国方面所提出的讨论第二项议程“为时过早”的说法是不能成立的。中国代表团发言人指出：如果说只有在第一项议程的协议实施完毕后才能进入第二项议程的讨论，那么由于中国在美国的侨民很多，全部愿意回国的在美国的中国人回到中国将是一个长时期的问题，因而在这一长时期中中美两国会谈将根本无法进行。这种说法是没有任何道理的，在国际会议中也是没有先例的。中国代表团在声明中重申中国方面是遵守它所达成的协议的。美国侨民近日来已开始陆续离开中国抵达香港，就是证明。忠实履行协议的问题不发生在中国方面而发生在美国方面。美方在会上所承认的、曾经申请回国而被阻止的许多中国人，从八月初会谈开始以来，至今还没有一个人回到中国。
    人们认为，实施协议所需要的时间决不能成为继续讨论第二项议程的障碍。中美会谈应该立即讨论王炳南大使在上次会议上提出的“禁运问题”和“准备更高一级的中美谈判问题”。不讨论或者拖延讨论第二项议程的做法都是行不通的。只有立即讨论和解决这些问题，才能对改进中美关系，缓和远东紧张局势和加强世界和平有所贡献。
