    A Large Number of Young People in Fujian Province Go to Mountain Areas to Reclaim Wasteland
    Recently, a large number of young people in Xiamen, Fuqing, and Putian in Fujian Province have volunteered to go to mountain areas to reclaim wasteland. Nine hundred and sixty young people from Fuqing and Putian counties have already set off for the mountain areas of Jianyang Prefecture. More than six hundred and forty people from Xiamen City have gone to mountainous areas of Yong'an, Ningyang and other counties to reclaim wasteland.
    The enthusiasm of young people from various places to go to mountain areas to reclaim wasteland is very high. Shen Yucai, a young man from Siming District in Xiamen City, applied three times to go to the mountain areas to participate in wasteland reclamation, and was finally approved. Before leaving, he excitedly said to his mother that he would develop the mountain areas well in the future, and after he established a new family, he would bring her to the mountain areas.
    Young people from various places who volunteered to go to the mountain areas to reclaim wasteland received a warm send-off from local people and cadres before their departure. They unanimously expressed that they would resolutely overcome difficulties, work hard to develop the mountain areas, and increase the production of more grain and industrial raw materials for the country.

    福建省大批青年到山区开荒
    福建省厦门、福清、莆田最近有大批青年志愿到山区开荒。福清、莆田两县的九百六十名青年已动身到建阳专区的山区去。厦门市已有六百四十多人到永安、宁洋等县的山区去垦荒。
    各地青年前往山区垦荒的热情很高。厦门市思明区青年沈玉赐曾经三次报名要求到山区去参加开荒，最后终于被批准了。他临走时兴奋地对他的母亲说，将来把山区开发好，等他建立了新家庭后，再接她到山区去。
    各地志愿到山区开荒的青年在临行前，受到当地群众和干部的热情欢送。他们一致表示要坚决克服困难，努力开发山区，为国家增产更多的粮食和工业原料。　（据新华社讯）
