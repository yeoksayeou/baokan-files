    Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 15th: According to TASS, the Communist Party of the United States submitted a formal appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on September 13th, demanding the abolition of the 1950 Internal Security Act.

    The appeal specifically pointed out that the Internal Security Act subjects America's "freedom of speech, publication, and assembly to unprecedented suppression," and that the Internal Security Act suppresses the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of voluntary association and collective activity.

    The appeal also stated that the basic premise of the Internal Security Act is incompatible with the "Geneva spirit."

    Newspapers reported that the Communist Party of the United States is taking this legal step to oppose a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals, which supports the Subversive Activities Control Board's order requiring the Communist Party and its members to register under the Internal Security Act.

    美国共产党要求废除反动的“国内安全法”
    新华社十六日讯  据塔斯社纽约十五日讯：美国共产党在九月十三日向美国最高法院提出一项正式上诉书，要求废除一九五零年的国内安全法。
    上诉书特别指出，国内安全法使美国的“言论、出版和集会自由受到史无前例的压制”，国内安全法压制宪法所保障的自愿结社和集体活动。
    上诉书还说，国内安全法的基本前提同“日内瓦精神”不相符合。
    报纸报道，美国共产党采取这个法律步骤是为了反对美国上诉法院的一项决定，这项决定支持颠覆活动管制委员会所发布的要共产党和它的党员根据国内安全法进行登记的命令。
