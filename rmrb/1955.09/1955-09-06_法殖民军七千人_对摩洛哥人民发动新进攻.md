Xinhua News Agency, September 5th dispatch from Casablanca: More than 7,000 French troops in Morocco, under the cover of tanks and aircraft, launched a new offensive at dawn on the 4th against the Smala tribe resisting French colonial rule in an area of 700 square miles near Oud Chemm, 75 miles southeast of Casablanca. The tribe rejected a so-called "final ultimatum" from the French military authorities demanding their surrender and retreated into the heavily forested mountains to continue their resistance.

    Reports say that the French army repeatedly searched the mountains and forests from east to west and from west to east, attempting to drive out all the members of the Smala tribe, then selecting those between the ages of fifteen and sixty to hand over to the French colonial authorities. However, the Smala tribe had already retreated before the French troops arrived. An Associated Press report stated: "When the columns surrounded a village and rushed in, they often found only empty huts."

    The French army continued to make large-scale arrests during the military operation. By noon on the 4th, about one hundred people had been arrested.

    This brutal repression by the French colonialists has aroused increasing anger among the Moroccan people. The Istiqlal Party, a Moroccan nationalist party, issued a statement on the 4th protesting the atrocities of the French authorities and warning that such policies would only lead to "tragic consequences."

    法殖民军七千人
    对摩洛哥人民发动新进攻
    新华社五日讯　卡萨布兰卡消息：在摩洛哥的法国军队七千多人在坦克和飞机掩护下，四日黎明又开始在卡萨布兰卡东南七十五英里的欧德柴姆附近面积七百平方英里的地区对反抗法国殖民统治的斯马拉部落大举进攻。这个部落拒绝了法军当局前些时候要他们投降的所谓“最后通牒”，而撤退到丛林密布的山野里继续进行反抗。
    消息说，法军在这个地区从东到西，又从西到东在山丛密林中反复搜索，企图把斯马拉部落的人都赶出来，然后把十五岁到六十岁的人挑出来，交给法国殖民当局处置。但是，在法军到达前，斯马拉部落已经撤退了。合众社消息说：“当纵队包围了一个村庄并且冲进去的时候，他们看到的往往只是一些没有人的茅舍。”
    法军在进行军事行动时继续大肆逮捕。到四日中午，已经有约一百个人被捕。
    法国殖民者这种残暴的镇压行动引起了摩洛哥人越来越大的愤怒。摩洛哥民族主义政党独立党在四日发表声明，抗议法国当局的暴行，并且提出警告说：这种政策只会造成“悲惨的后果”。
