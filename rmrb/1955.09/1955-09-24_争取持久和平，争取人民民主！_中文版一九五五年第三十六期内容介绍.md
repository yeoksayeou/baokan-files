"For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, Chinese edition No. 36, 1955, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Consolidation and Power of People's Democratic Countries." The editorial points out: The achievements of the people's democratic countries in building socialism once again prove the great vitality and consolidation of the people's democratic system, and prove that the people of these countries enjoy unlimited creative opportunities. The achievements made by the people's democratic countries in the struggle to lay the foundations of socialism have aroused the aspirations of the working people all over the world. However, the reactionaries in Western countries are hostile to the achievements made by the working people in the people's democratic countries, and they spread rumors and slander these countries. They have repeatedly raised the issue of abolishing the people's democratic system. The editorial emphasizes that, whether in the early days of liberation from the shackles of fascism or in the years that followed, the broad masses of the people in the people's democratic countries wholeheartedly supported the people's regime. They do not allow others to interfere in their internal affairs, and no force in the world can force them to abandon the socialist path they have chosen. Broad prospects are unfolding before the working people of the people's democratic countries. They are moving forward firmly under the great banner of socialism. The endless strength of the working people, the ever-consolidating worker-peasant alliance, the wise leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, and the friendship and fraternal alliance of the people of socialist countries, all these are guarantees for the further achievements of the people's democratic countries in building a new life.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Marching on the Road of Socialist Construction" by Constantin Nistor, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic; "The Work of the Italian Communist Party's District Organizations" by Amendola, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party; and "General Elections and the Tasks of the Indonesian Communist Party" by D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party.

Aidit's article talks about the great significance of the upcoming general election for the Indonesian parliament and the tasks of the Indonesian Communist Party. The article emphasizes that the most urgent political task of the Indonesian Communist Party at present is to strive for the victory of the national front in the upcoming general election, in order to establish a national coalition government firmly supported by all democratic forces. Only by completing the above tasks can we defend the democratic principles of the Republic of Indonesia, which is the task of defending our national independence, safeguarding peace and democracy, and strengthening unity.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”  中文版一九五五年第三十六期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第三十六期中文版已经出版。
    这一期发表了题为“人民民主国家的巩固和威力”的社论。社论指出：人民民主国家建设社会主义的成就再一次证明了人民民主制度的伟大生命力和巩固性，证明了这些国家人民享有无限的创造机会。各人民民主国家在奠定社会主义基础的斗争中所取得的成就引起了全世界劳动人民的向往。但是，西方国家的反动分子仇视人民民主国家的劳动人民所取得的成就，他们散布谣言，诽谤这些国家。他们一再提出废除人民民主制度的问题。社论强调指出，不论是在从法西斯枷锁下解放出来的初期，还是在以后的年代中，人民民主国家广大群众都全心全意地拥护人民政权。他们不容许别人干涉自己的内政，世界上也没有任何力量能够强迫他们放弃自己选定的社会主义道路。人民民主国家劳动人民的面前展现着广阔的远景。他们正在社会主义的伟大旗帜之下坚定不移地迈进。劳动人民无穷无尽的力量、日益巩固的工农联盟、共产党和工人党的英明领导、社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊和兄弟联盟，这一切就是人民民主国家在建设新生活方面取得进一步的成就的保证。
    这一期刊载的重要文章有：罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员、罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席康斯坦丁尼斯库的“在社会主义建设的道路上迈进”，意大利共产党书记处书记阿门多拉的“意大利共产党区组织的工作”，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会总书记艾地的“普选和印度尼西亚共产党的任务”等。
    艾地的文章谈到了即将到来的印度尼西亚国会普选的重大意义和印度尼西亚共产党的任务。文章着重说，印度尼西亚共产党当前最紧急的政治任务就是争取民族阵线在即将举行的普选中获得胜利，以建立一个为全体民主力量坚决支持的全国联合政府。只有完成上述任务，我们才能捍卫印度尼西亚共和国的民主原则，而这也就是捍卫我国民族独立、保卫和平民主与加强团结的斗争任务。
