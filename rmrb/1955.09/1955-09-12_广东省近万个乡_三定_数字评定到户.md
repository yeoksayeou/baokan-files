Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 11th: Nearly ten thousand townships in Guangdong Province have completed the assessment of "Three Fixes" figures to households, with more than seven thousand townships currently undergoing review work. After careful investigation and democratic evaluation, the surplus grain households and grain-deficient households have been largely distinguished in various localities.

After state purchasing based on fixed quotas, many farmers have increased their surplus grain. According to statistics from over three hundred townships in nine counties of the Yuebei area, the fixed purchase quantity decreased by more than 20% compared to last year's purchase volume, and the unified sales quantity decreased by 37% compared to last year. As a result, the average farmer in these three hundred townships had over 50 jin more surplus grain than last year. In the "Three Fixes" review in nine townships, including Yuanshan and Gaoqiao in Yingde County, 15 households that should have sold grain but did not, more than 300 households that should not have sold grain but did, and more than 20 households that should not have been sold grain but did sell grain were adjusted. The masses expressed satisfaction with this realistic approach.

When assessing the fixed purchase and fixed sales figures, many grain-deficient households proposed to "eat their own stored grain first, and then sell grain supplied by the state"; surplus grain households also strived to sell more grain in the summer, so that they could retain more grain for themselves after the autumn harvest for use next spring. The grain sold by many agricultural production cooperatives in the summer accounts for more than half of the annual unified purchase figures. The Sanfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sanfeng Village, Nanxiong County, increased its early rice production by 53% this year. In addition to keeping enough grain for use until the autumn harvest, the members completed the annual unified purchase task. Under their influence, a mutual aid team also completed 70% of its annual unified purchase task during the summer purchase. The entire village has completed 66% of its annual unified purchase task in the summer.

    广东省近万个乡“三定”数字评定到户
    新华社广州十一日电　广东省已有近一万个乡把“三定”数字评定到户，其中有七千多个乡现正进行复查工作。经过细致的调查和民主评议后，各地大体上分清了余粮户和缺粮户。
    按照定购数字统购以后，许多农民剩余的粮食都有增加。据粤北区九个县三百多个乡的统计，定购数量比去年购量减少百分之二十多，统销数量比去年减少百分之三十七。因此，这三百多个乡平均每个农民剩余粮食都比去年增加了五十多斤。英德县园山、高桥等九个乡在“三定”复查中，又调整了应购而未购的农户十五户，不应购而购的三百多户，不应销而销的二十多户。群众对这种实事求是的作法都表示满意。
    在评定定购定销数字时，许多缺粮户提出要“先吃自己存粮，后卖国家供应粮”；余粮户也争取夏季多卖粮，以便秋收后自己可多留粮，以备明年春季需用。许多农业生产合作社夏季出卖的粮食，都占全年统购数字的一半以上。南雄县三枫村三枫农业生产合作社，今年早稻增产百分之五十三，社员们除留下到秋收时期的用粮外，完成了全年统购任务。在他们的影响下，一个互助组也在夏购中完成了全年统购任务的百分之七十，全村在夏季已完成了全年统购任务的百分之六十六。
