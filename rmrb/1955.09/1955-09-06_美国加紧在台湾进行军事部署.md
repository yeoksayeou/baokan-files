Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The United States is busily carrying out military deployments in the Taiwan Strait area. The United Press International admitted that the Sino-US ambassadorial talks "have not had the slightest impact" on the US's work to "strengthen its forces" in Taiwan.

    The U.S. Far East Air Force authorities announced that two squadrons of the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing began moving from Okinawa to Taiwan on September 3 for 30 days of "maneuver training." According to the Associated Press, in order to make Taiwan function as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier," the United States is currently expanding Taiwan's airports and transporting large quantities of fuel and ammunition there.

    At the same time, the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are negotiating a plan in Taiwan for the United States to equip nine to ten reserve divisions of the Chiang bandit army. For some time now, the U.S. military aid program for Taiwan has already included twenty-one Chiang bandit army ground force divisions and two smaller armored divisions.

    The United States is also stepping up its combat arrangements on the coastal islands occupied by the Chiang bandit army. At the end of August, Walker, the deputy head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group and head of the Army Group, visited Matsu. With his participation, the Chiang bandit army in Matsu held a joint land and sea combat exercise.

    美国加紧在台湾进行军事部署
    新华社四日讯　美国在台湾海峡地区的军事部署正在忙碌地进行。合众社承认，中美大使级的会谈对于美国在台湾“加强力量”的工作“没有丝毫的影响”。
    美国远东空军当局宣布，第十八战斗轰炸机联队的两个中队在九月三日开始从冲绳岛调往台湾，以进行三十天的“机动训练”。据合众社报道，美国为了使台湾起“不沉的航空母舰”的作用，目前正在扩充台湾的机场，并且运去大批燃料和弹药。
    同时，美国和蒋介石卖国集团正在台湾谈判由美国装备九个到十个蒋贼军后备师的计划。若干时候以来，美国对台湾的军事援助计划已经包括了二十一个蒋贼军地面部队师和两个较小的装甲师。
    美国也加紧在蒋贼军盘踞下的沿海岛屿进行作战布置。八月底，美国军事援助顾问团副团长兼陆军组长华克尔曾到马祖活动。在他的参加下，马祖的蒋贼军举行了陆海军联合作战演习。
