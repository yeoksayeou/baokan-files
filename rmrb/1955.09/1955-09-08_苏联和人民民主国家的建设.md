    The Construction of the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Five Million People Visit Soviet Agricultural Exhibition
    The 1955 Soviet Agricultural Exhibition has been open for three months. During this period, a total of more than five million people visited the exhibition, including more than 700 foreign delegations from 67 countries.
    Over the past three months, the exhibition has organized a total of 700 symposiums, lectures, and reports, where advanced agricultural producers, agricultural experts, and scientists have shared advanced production experiences and new achievements in agricultural science. In addition, central and local publishing agencies have distributed five million pamphlets and promotional materials, widely introducing advanced production experiences in various sectors of Soviet agriculture.
    During this period, the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition also screened 180 agricultural science and technology films and "Agricultural News" documentaries for exhibition participants and audiences, with over three million viewers.
    Due to the continuous emergence of advanced individuals and agricultural production units in Soviet agriculture and animal husbandry production this year, the General Affairs Committee of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition has recently approved and accepted a new batch of exhibition participants.
    The exhibition's special publication "Advanced Experience" published a batch of letters written by soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the General Affairs Committee of the exhibition on the 3rd. The letters stated: The increase in participants in the 1955 Soviet Agricultural Exhibition demonstrates the superiority and infinite potential of the Soviet collective agricultural system, which encourages us to embark on the road of agricultural collectivization. Because the Soviet Union's today is China's tomorrow.
    Bulgarian People Greet National Day with Competitions
    The working people of Bulgaria are enthusiastically celebrating the eleventh anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation on September 9th with new labor achievements.
    In the competition to welcome the festival, miners in the Rhodope mining area are overfulfilling their plans by mining hundreds of tons of ore every day. The Stalin Chemical Plant in Dimitrovgrad exceeded its August production plan by 37 percent. The Karl Marx Soda Ash Factory in the Stalin region has won the mobile red flag of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers three times and is currently producing October's products. In Gabrovo, 99 percent of the textile workers at the Tralov Textile Factory have learned to manage multiple machines. The workers have already produced 280,000 meters of cotton fabric that was originally planned for October. Workers at the Gniev Textile Factory have also overfulfilled their plan for the first eight months of this year, producing enough extra woolen fabric to make approximately 20,000 men's suits and winter overcoats.
    To welcome the festival, the working farmers everywhere are accelerating the sale of grain to the state, and at the same time, they have plowed half of the cultivated land to sow spring crops.
    North Korea's Heavy Industry Output Will Exceed the 1949 Level This Year
    The total output of North Korea's heavy industry will exceed the pre-war level of 1949 by the end of 1955 and will reach the planned level for 1956, the final year of the three-year plan.
    In the metallurgical industry, the No. 1 blast furnace of the Kim Chaek Ironworks was repaired, rebuilt, and put into production in May, and its daily output increased from 500 tons to 700 tons. The production efficiency of other steel plants with complete sets of equipment for steelmaking and rolling, such as the Chongjin Steel Plant, the Hwanghae Ironworks, the Kangson Steel Plant, and non-ferrous metal smelting plants in Nampo and Munpyong, has also improved after repair and reconstruction. Compared with 1946, the output of the metallurgical sector has increased more than seven times for pig iron, 12.9 times for steel ingots, 3.4 times for alloy steel, and nine times for steel plates.
    In the mining industry, which is directly related to the metallurgical industry, the ore dressing plants of mines such as the Songhung and Taeyudong mines have been restored and expanded. Mines such as Geomdeok, Seongcheon, and Musan, equipped with the latest technology, are producing large quantities of iron, gold, silver, copper and other ores. North Korea's machine industry has recovered and developed particularly rapidly. The newly built Heechon Machine Manufacturing Factory and Heechon Auto Parts Factory have been put into production. The original Rakwon Machinery Factory, which produces mining machinery and parts, and the Ryongsong Machine Manufacturing Factory, which produces machinery and parts needed by the chemical and cement industries, have resumed production. They have produced many new products.
    In the electrical industry, the power generation equipment of the Changjin River, Hochon River, and Puning River power stations has been partially repaired and put into production, ensuring the power needs of various economic sectors. The power supplied to agricultural irrigation systems alone has increased from 48,000 horsepower at the time of the armistice to the current 60,800 horsepower. It is expected that all important hydroelectric power stations will be restored by the end of 1956.
    Mongolian Herdsmen Ensure Livestock Overwinter Successfully
    Ensuring the successful overwintering of livestock is one of the important tasks for developing animal husbandry in the Mongolian People's Republic. Mongolian herdsmen began storing feed, building livestock pens, digging wells, selecting winter pastures, and making other preparations in the summer.
    This year, agricultural and pastoral cooperatives across Mongolia will build 2,348 livestock pens to house more than 300,000 livestock. Ordinary herdsmen will build 11,370 livestock pens to house more than 1.38 million livestock.
    Poland Achieves Best Harvest in Eleven Years
    Poland's grain harvest this year is better than any year in the past eleven years, with an average yield of about two quintals per hectare more than before the war. At present, the grain harvesting work in various parts of Poland is nearing completion, and agricultural workers are accelerating the threshing work and selling grain to the state. This year's achievement is due to the government's greater assistance to agriculture and the selfless efforts of agricultural workers. In the next five-year plan (1956-1960), the government's assistance to agricultural workers will be further expanded, especially the supply of artificial fertilizers will be greatly increased. During this period, Poland's production of agricultural machinery and tools will triple, of which the production of tractors will double. There will be 10,000 combine harvesters supplied to agriculture.
    The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Decides to Develop Animal Husbandry
    The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held a plenary session in Prague on August 31st and September 1st. The meeting heard and discussed the report by V. Krutina on the further development of animal husbandry and on the tasks of state farms in improving agricultural production and adopted corresponding resolutions.
    The resolution pointed out that Czechoslovakia has made some achievements in developing agricultural production. Unified agricultural production cooperatives are constantly consolidating, especially after the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in June. Farmers are constantly organizing new cooperatives.
    The plenary session pointed out that significant improvements have not been achieved in certain aspects of agricultural production, especially in animal husbandry. Therefore, the resolution put forward the main task: to ensure the rapid development of animal husbandry in the recent years, primarily by greatly increasing the production of feed and the product yield of livestock, improving breeding work, and resolutely preventing livestock diseases.
    The resolution pointed out that in order to ensure the growing needs of the residents, Czechoslovakia must produce an average of 63,600 liters of milk, 5,590 kilograms of beef, and 11,350 kilograms of pork per 100 hectares of agricultural land annually before 1960.
    The resolution attached great importance to further improving the work of state farms. The resolution stipulated tasks in aspects such as staffing state farms with cadres, improving planning work, ensuring profitability, and rectifying the financial system.
    Albanian Workers Race Against Time
    More than 9,000 workers in Albania completed the state plan ahead of schedule in the first half of this year. They are already doing the work for 1956 to 1959.
    The achievements of Hikri Kanabari, a nationally renowned tractor driver in Albania, are particularly outstanding. He completed 447 percent of his work quota in 1953, and had completed the 1958 plan by August of this year. He is now doing the work for 1959. The land he has cultivated is all in compliance with agronomic regulations. Recently, he also guaranteed to complete his personal production quota in the second five-year plan (1956-1960) before June 30 next year. To commend Kanabari's outstanding achievements, the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania has awarded him the Labor Medal.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    五百万人参观苏联农业展览会
    一九五五年的苏联农业展览会自从开幕到现在已经三个月了。在这个期间，总共有五百多万人参观了展览会，其中包括来自六十七个国家的七百多个外国代表团。
    三个月来，展览会总共组织了七百次座谈会、讲座和报告会，由先进农业生产者、农业专家和科学家向大家传授先进生产经验和农业科学的新成就。此外，中央和地方出版机关还发行了五百万册小册子和宣传材料，广泛向人们介绍了苏联农业各部门中的先进生产经验。
    在这期间，苏联农业展览会还为展览会参加者和观众放映了一百八十场农业科学技术影片和“农业新闻”纪录片，观众达三百多万人。
    由于今年苏联农业和畜牧业生产中不断出现先进的人物和农业生产单位，最近苏联农业展览会总务委员会又批准和接受了一批新的展览会参加者。
    展览会专刊“先进经验”报三日发表了一批中国人民解放军战士写给展览会总务委员会的信。信上说：一九五五年苏联农业展览会参加者的增多，说明了苏联集体农业制度的优越性和无穷的潜力，这鼓舞我们走上农业集体化的道路。因为，苏联的今天就是中国的明天。
    保加利亚人民迎接国庆的竞赛
    保加利亚的劳动人民纷纷以新的劳动成就迎接九月九日保加利亚解放十一周年。
    在迎接节日的竞赛中，罗多彼矿区的矿工每天都超计划多开采几百吨矿砂。季米特洛夫格拉德的斯大林化学工厂超额百分之三十七完成了八月份生产计划。斯大林州的卡尔·马克思制碱工厂三次获得了保加利亚部长会议的流动红旗，目前正在生产十月份的产品。在加布罗沃城，特拉罗夫纺织厂的百分之九十九的纺织工人都学会了多台机器的管理，现在工人们已经生产了原来列在十月份计划中的二十八万公尺的棉织品；格尼耶夫纺织厂的工人也超额完成了今年头八个月的计划，单是超计划生产的毛织品就约可缝制两万件男装和冬季用男大衣。
    为了迎接节日，各地的劳动农民正在加速把谷物交售给国家，同时还把一半的耕地面积进行了翻耕，用来播种春季作物。
    朝鲜重工业产量今年将超过一九四九年水平
    朝鲜重工业的总产量到一九五五年底将超过战前一九四九年的水平，并且将达到一九五六年——三年计划的最后一年的计划水平。
    在冶金工业中，金策制铁所的第一号高炉在今年五月间修复、改建完成，并且开始生产，日产量从原来的五百吨提高到七百吨。其他拥有炼钢、压延等整套设备的城津炼钢厂、黄海制铁所、降仙炼钢厂，以及南浦、文坪等有色金属冶炼厂在修复和改建后，生产效率也都提高了。现在冶金部门的产量和一九四六年相比，生铁增加到七倍以上，钢锭增加到十二点九倍，合金钢增加到三点四倍，钢板增加到九倍。
    和冶金工业直接有关的采矿工业中的成兴、大榆洞等矿山的选矿厂得到恢复和扩建。拥有最新技术装备的检德、成川、茂山等矿山正生产着大量的铁、金、银、铜等矿石。朝鲜机器工业恢复发展得特别迅速。战后新建的熙川机器制造工厂和熙川汽车零件工厂都已投入生产。原有的生产矿山机械和零件的乐原机械厂、生产化学和水泥工业需用的机械和零件的龙城机器制造工厂等都已恢复生产。它们生产了许多新的产品。
    在电气工业方面，长津江、虚川江、富宁江等发电站的发电设备都部分地修复了，并且投入了生产，保证了各经济部门对电力的需要。停战后仅供给农业灌溉系统的电力就已从停战当时的四万八千匹马力增加到目前的六万零八百匹马力。预计到一九五六年底各重要水力发电站将都得到恢复。
    蒙古牧民保证牲畜顺利过冬
    保证牲畜顺利过冬是蒙古人民共和国发展畜牧业的重要工作之一。蒙古牧民们从夏天就开始贮藏饲料，建筑畜圈，掘井，选择冬季牧场和进行其他准备工作。
    今年蒙古全国农牧业合作社将建筑两千三百四十八个畜圈以饲养三十多万头牲畜。普通牧民将修建一万一千三百七十个畜圈以饲养一百三十八万多头牲畜。
    波兰获得十一年来未有的丰收
    波兰今年的谷物收成比过去十一年中任何一年的收成都好，谷物的收获量平均每公顷比战前约多二公担。目前，波兰各地的谷物收割工作已经将近完成，农业劳动者正在加速进行打谷工作和向国家交售谷物。今年的成就是由于政府对农业给与了更大的帮助和农业劳动者忘我努力得来的。在下一个五年计划（一九五六—一九六○年）中，政府对农业劳动者的帮助还将进一步扩大，特别是人造肥料的供应将大大增加。在这个时期中，波兰农业机器和农具的产量将增为三倍，其中拖拉机的产量将增为两倍。供给农业的联合机将有一万台。
    捷共中央决定发展畜牧业
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会八月三十一日和九月一日在布拉格举行了全体会议，会议听取并且讨论了弗·克鲁蒂纳所作的关于进一步发展畜牧业和关于国营农场在提高农业生产方面的任务的报告，并且通过了相应的决议。
    决议指出，捷克斯洛伐克在发展农业生产方面已经取得了一些成就。统一农业生产合作社不断地巩固，特别是在捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会六月全体会议之后。农民不断地组织新的合作社。
    全体会议指出，在农业生产的某些方面、特别是在畜牧业方面，并没有获得重大的改善。因而，决议提出了主要的任务：在最近几年内保证迅速地发展畜牧业，首先通过大大提高饲料的生产和牲畜的产品率，改善育种方面的工作和坚决防治牲畜疾病。
    决议指出，为了保证居民的日益增长的需要，在一九六零年以前，捷克斯洛伐克共和国平均每一百公顷农业用地每年必须出产六万三千六百公升奶类，五千五百九十公斤牛肉和一万一千三百五十公斤猪肉。
    决议十分重视进一步改善国营农场工作。决议规定了以干部充实国营农场、改善计划工作、保证赢利和整顿财务制度等方面的任务。
    阿尔巴尼亚工人同时间赛跑
    阿尔巴尼亚今年上半年有九千多个工人提前完成了国家计划。他们已经在做一九五六年到一九五九年的工作。
    阿尔巴尼亚全国闻名的拖拉机手希克里·卡纳巴里的成绩特别突出。他在一九五三年完成了工作定额的百分之四百四十七，今年八月以前就完成了一九五八年的计划。现在他已经在做一九五九年的工作。他所耕过的田地，都是符合农艺规程的。最近，他还保证在明年六月三十日以前，完成第二个五年计划（一九五六—一九六○年）中的个人生产定额。为了表扬卡纳巴里的卓越成绩，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团已经授给他劳动勋章。
