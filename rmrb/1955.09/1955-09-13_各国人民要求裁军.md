People of All Countries Demand Disarmament
Tan Wenrui

The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, in accordance with the decision of the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference, reconvened in New York on August 29. Peace-loving people all over the world are watching the proceedings of the meeting with hope. There is reason to ask the countries participating in the meeting to find a mutually acceptable solution and open a real path to achieving universal disarmament and banning atomic weapons.

Since the end of the Geneva Conference, the calls for an end to the arms race from people around the world have been louder than ever. The "New York Times" of the United States recently admitted that Washington is also deeply feeling the increasing pressure of this "huge wave of public opinion" that is sweeping across countries. This is not difficult to understand. Because the determination and confidence of the people of all countries to strive for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons have never been so greatly encouraged as they are today.

Public opinion in various countries has always believed that the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal put forward on May 10 this year provides a practical basis for solving this major problem. Because this proposal accepted the opinions of Western countries in many aspects, thereby bringing everyone's opinions closer. At the Geneva Conference, the heads of government of the four countries fully exchanged views on the issue of disarmament and agreed to explore ways to reach an agreement based on the proposals put forward by all parties. The gains of the Geneva Conference in this regard are deeply satisfying to public opinion in various countries. Newspapers in many countries have emphasized that the convergence of opinions among the four countries has created the prerequisites for further discussion of the substantive aspects of the disarmament issue. The "New York Herald Tribune" of the United States also believes that the discussions on disarmament at the Geneva Conference "opened up new prospects and opened up the possibility of the most promising achievements."

Peace-loving people in all countries attach particular importance to the valuable contribution made by the Geneva Conference in strengthening international trust. As everyone knows, the most important obstacle to the long-term lack of progress in the discussion of disarmament issues is the lack of understanding and trust between countries. But as the British "Daily Mirror" said, "The Geneva Conference dispelled the clouds of distrust that have enveloped mankind for ten years." This has created a favorable atmosphere for resolving all outstanding international issues. In his speech at the Geneva Conference, US President Eisenhower also acknowledged that the Soviet Union "sincerely hopes for peace" and said that "it is not always necessary for people to have the same ideas and beliefs in order to cooperate." Then there should be no insurmountable difficulties on the road to disarmament. Therefore, people of all countries cannot but have greater confidence in achieving disarmament and banning atomic weapons. The French "L'Humanité" once reflected such a common view, saying: "Everyone agrees that the Geneva Conference has greatly promoted the change in the atmosphere of international relations. Many things that seemed impossible or even unimaginable a few days ago have become possible since then."

People of all countries are encouraged by the easing of the international situation, and at the same time, they have stepped up the struggle to achieve universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The tenth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima once again reminded the people of all countries of the serious disasters that weapons of mass destruction can cause to mankind. On August 6, calls of "Hiroshima must not be repeated" were issued from almost every corner of the world. Twelve religious and educational leaders in the United States also jointly called: "Let us recognize from now on that no one has the moral right to drop an atomic bomb on another nation at any time or for any reason, and let this understanding become the basis of national policy."

Public opinion in many Western countries demands that activities to expand armaments and prepare for war be stopped without delay. The West German "Die Welt" frankly said: From an economic point of view, Western countries also have a vested interest in reducing armaments. The British "Daily Herald" on August 26 clearly advocated: Britain "needs to transfer manpower to productive industries, reduce the burden of armaments and end the waste of manpower. Use it to attack the economic crisis." This proposition and demand are obviously reasonable. No one can hide the fact that the people of the vast majority of capitalist countries have been overwhelmed by the heavy burden of expanding armaments. Even the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler had to admit that the harshness of economic difficulties forced Britain to cut its national expenditure, and of course, military expenditure came first. At the same time, the general public is also increasingly aware that scientific achievements have great potential to improve the living standards of people in various countries. Some scientists in Western countries have pointed out that if the vast amount of knowledge and national property now used in preparing for massacres is used to protect and improve life, then unimaginable great achievements will be made. Therefore, it is only natural that the people of all countries are increasingly demanding that their governments stop pursuing the policy of "guns instead of butter."

The firm stance and sincere efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving democratic countries on the issue of disarmament cannot but have a positive impact on the movement of people of all countries to strive for disarmament. Public opinion in various countries warmly welcomes and praises the Soviet government's decision to reduce its armed forces by 640,000 troops, believing that this is another major contribution to strengthening international trust and will help promote the settlement of the issue of universal disarmament. The Norwegian "Morgenposten" wrote: The Soviet leaders have proved with new and amazing actions that they sincerely hope that the tense situation will continue to ease as it is now and hope to eliminate the fear of war. In this way, they have created an extremely favorable atmosphere on the eve of the resumption of the talks by the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission in accordance with the decision of the four major powers.

Following the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Albania and Hungary also decided to reduce their armed forces. Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of our country, also pointed out at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress in July this year: "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have demobilized more than 4.51 million people from the army. We warmly support the Soviet government's proposal on May 10, 1955, on the issue of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat to the new war. We also fully support the Soviet government's proposal to convene a world conference on universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, with the participation of member and non-member states of the United Nations, no later than the first half of 1956. If this conference can be held and an agreement is reached on the basis of the Soviet government's proposal, the Chinese government is willing to further reduce its own army." These facts irrefutably show that the peace-loving democratic countries are not only promoting universal disarmament in words, but also in deeds. Public opinion in various countries has called on Western countries to take the same action. The Czechoslovak "Práce" wrote: "If the United States, Britain and France take similar measures without delay, it will be more conducive to establishing an atmosphere of international trust and in line with the interests of disarmament, which is what the people of all countries demand." The British "Manchester Guardian" also believes that it may be time for Western public opinion to "demand that Western governments also take corresponding measures."

However, some people with ulterior motives in Western countries deliberately want to belittle the significance of the actual actions of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving democratic countries in reducing their troops, saying that the Soviet Union's move is for propaganda purposes, that the Soviet Union's decision to disarm is out of necessity due to a lack of manpower... However, this kind of slanderous propaganda is in vain. Belgian Senator Struye denounced these malicious propaganda, saying: "It should be honestly admitted that if increasing the army by 640,000 people is a manifestation of a belligerent sentiment, then reducing so many troops should be regarded as a measure of peace-loving and should be expressed satisfaction with it."

Some recent remarks by US officials have particularly aroused dissatisfaction and unease in public opinion in various countries. US Secretary of Defense Wilson stated after the Soviet Union announced the reduction of its troops that the United States would not make any reductions in its troops in the foreseeable future. US Air Force Secretary Quarles also declared that the goal of US policy is not disarmament at all, but to maintain a huge "deterrent capability." Obviously, this kind of words and deeds that spread distrust and confrontation are completely contrary to the road planned by the Geneva Conference, and are also completely contrary to the common wishes and will of the people of all countries.

Stopping the arms race and banning atomic weapons has become the most urgent demand of hundreds of millions of people today, and this demand cannot be ignored. Anyone who uses any excuse to obstruct the settlement of the disarmament issue will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the people of the world.

    各国人民要求裁军
    谭文瑞
    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会已根据日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的决定，于八月二十九日在纽约复会。全世界爱好和平的人民满怀希望地密切注视着会议的进行。人们有理由要求参加会议的各国找出一个大家都能接受的解决办法，为实现普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器打开真正的道路。
    日内瓦会议结束以来，各国人民要求停止军备竞赛的呼声比过去任何时候更加响亮。美国“纽约时报”不久以前承认，华盛顿方面也深深感到这种遍及各国的“舆论巨浪”日益增加的压力。这是不难理解的。因为各国人民争取裁军和禁止原子武器的决心和信心，从来没有像今天这样的受到如此巨大的鼓舞。
    各国舆论一直认为，苏联今年五月十日提出的裁军建议，给解决这一重大问题提供了切实的基础。因为这个建议在许多方面接受了西方国家的意见，从而使大家的意见接近了。在日内瓦会议上，四国政府首脑就裁军问题充分地交换了意见，并同意根据各方面提出的建议探求达成协议的途径。日内瓦会议在这方面的收获，是各国舆论所深感满意的。许多国家的报纸都着重指出，四国意见的接近，使进一步讨论裁军问题的实质部分有了先决条件。美国的“纽约先驱论坛报”也认为日内瓦会议关于裁军问题的讨论，“打开了新的前途，打开了最有远大作为的可能性”。
    爱好和平的各国人民特别重视日内瓦会议在加强国际信任方面所作的宝贵贡献。大家知道，裁军问题的讨论所以长久没有获得进展，最主要的障碍就是各国之间缺乏谅解和信任。但是正如英国“每日镜报”所说的“日内瓦会议驱散了十年来笼罩在人类头上的不信任的乌云”。这就为解决一切悬而未决的国际问题创造了有利的气氛。美国总统艾森豪威尔在日内瓦会议上的发言中也承认苏联“是真诚地希望和平的”，并且说“并不总是一定要人们的思想和信仰一样，然后才能合作”。那末在裁军的道路上应当是没有什么不可克服的困难的。因此，各国人民不能不对实现裁减军备和禁止原子武器，怀有更大的信心。法国“人道报”曾经反映过这样一种普遍的看法说：“大家都同意，日内瓦会议已大大促进了国际关系的气氛的改变。在几天前还显得是不可能的，甚至很难想像的许多事从此已成为可能的了。”
    各国人民因为国际局势趋向缓和而感到鼓舞，同时并加紧了争取实现普遍裁军和禁止原子武器的斗争。广岛遭受原子弹轰炸十周年，再一次提醒各国人民大规模毁灭性武器会给人类造成什么样的严重灾难。在八月六日那一天，几乎从世界各个角落都发出了“不许广岛事件重演”的呼声。美国的十二名宗教界和教育界领袖也同声呼吁：“让我们从此认识到，任何人都没有道义上的权利在任何时候或为了任何理由向另一个民族投掷一颗原子弹，并且让这种认识成为国家政策的基础。”
    许多西方国家的舆论，要求毫不迟延地停止扩军备战的活动。西德“世界报”坦率地说：从经济原因来看西方国家对裁减军备也是利益相关的。英国“每日先驱报”八月二十六日而且明确主张：英国“需要把人力转入生产性的工业，减轻军备负担和结束人力的浪费。利用它来进攻经济危机。”这种主张和要求显然是有道理的。谁都不能掩饰这样的事实：绝大多数资本主义国家的人民已被扩军的重担压得喘不过气来。连英国的财政大臣巴特勒也不得不承认，经济困难的冷酷情况迫使英国必需削减它的国家开支，首先当然是军事开支。同时，广大公众也愈来愈明白，科学的成就是有着提高各国人民生活水平的巨大可能性的。西方国家的一些科学家指出，如果把现在用在准备屠杀方面的大量知识和国家财产用来保障和改善生活，那末将会取得难以预料的巨大成就。因此，各国人民日益强烈地要求他们的政府停止奉行“大炮代替黄油”的政策，是理所当然的。
    苏联和其他和平民主国家在裁军问题上的坚定立场和真诚努力，自然不能不对各国人民争取裁军的运动发生积极的影响。各国舆论热烈欢迎和赞扬苏联政府裁减武装部队六十四万人的决定，认为这是对加强国际信任的又一重大贡献，将有助于促成普遍裁军问题的解决。挪威“晨邮报”就这样写道：苏联领导者们以新的惊人行动来证明了他们真诚希望紧张局势像目前那样继续和缓下去，希望消除战争恐惧。这样，他们就在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会根据四大国的决定恢复会谈的前夕创造了极其有利的气氛。
    继苏联之后，波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚和匈牙利等国也先后决定裁减自己的武装部队。我国国防部长彭德怀今年七月十六日在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上也曾指出：“从中华人民共和国成立到现在，我们已经从军队中复员了四百五十一万多人。我们热烈地支持苏联政府在一九五五年五月十日提出的关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议。我们也完全支持苏联政府提出的最迟在一九五六年上半年召开有联合国会员国和非会员国参加的世界普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器会议的建议。如果这个会议能够开成，并在苏联政府建议的基础上达成协议，中国政府愿意进一步裁减自己的军队。”这些事实都无可辩驳地说明，各和平民主国家不仅在口头上而且以实际行动来促成普遍裁减军备。各国舆论纷纷要求西方国家采取同样的行动。捷克斯洛伐克“劳动报”写道：“如果美、英、法三个国家毫不拖延地采取类似的措施，就会更加有助于建立国际信任的气氛和符合裁减军备的利益，而这正是各国人民所要求的。”英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”也认为：可能已到了西方舆论“要求西方政府也采取相应措施”的时候了。
    但是西方国家一些别有用心的人，却故意想贬低苏联和其他和平民主国家裁减军队的实际行动的意义，说什么苏联的举措出于宣传的目的啦，什么苏联裁军的决定是出于人力缺乏的不得已啦……然而这种诬蔑宣传是枉费心机的。比利时参议员斯特律耶就指斥这些恶意宣传说：“应当诚恳地承认，如果增加军队六十四万人是表现好战的情绪的话，那末裁减这么多军队就应当被看成是爱好和平的措施，应当对它表示满意。”
    美国负责官员们近来的一些言论，特别引起各国舆论的不满和不安。美国国防部长威尔逊就在苏联宣布裁减军队之后声明，在预见的将来，美国的部队不会作任何裁减。美国空军部长卡利斯也宣称：美国的政策的目标根本不是裁军，而是保持巨大的“威慑能力”。很显然，这种散布不信任和对立空气的言行，是完全背离日内瓦会议所规划的道路的，也是完全违背各国人民的共同愿望和意志的。
    停止军备竞赛和禁止原子武器，今天已成为亿万人民的最迫切的要求，这种要求是不容忽视的。任何人用任何借口来阻挠裁军问题的解决，都必然要遭到全世界人民的坚决反对。
