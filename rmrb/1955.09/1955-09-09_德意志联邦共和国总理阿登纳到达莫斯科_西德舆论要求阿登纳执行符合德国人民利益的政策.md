Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, TASS dispatch, August 8th: At the invitation of the Soviet government, the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, led by Federal Chancellor Adenauer, arrived in Moscow on the 8th.

Welcoming Adenauer and the delegation were: Bulganin, Molotov, Pervukhin, Suslov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet, Kabanov, Minister of Foreign Trade, Gromyko, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Semyonov and other officials, as well as representatives of the Soviet and foreign press.

Also welcoming Adenauer and the delegation were the doyen of the diplomatic corps in Moscow, Swedish Ambassador Sohlman, and the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th: On the eve of West German Chancellor Adenauer's visit to Moscow, West German public opinion is increasingly voicing sober calls for Adenauer to implement policies that conform to the interests of the German people.

The Social Democratic youth organization "The Falcons" published an open letter demanding that Adenauer remember, when he arrives in Moscow: "His policies must serve the interests of the German people first and foremost, and not put the instructions of Western countries first," and demanded that Adenauer adopt a wise policy to contribute, and not be recorded in history as the main culprit advocating the division of Germany.

The West German financial newspaper "Politische Ökonomie" pointed out in a commentary on Adenauer's visit to Moscow published on the 3rd: If Adenauer is truly concerned about the reunification of Germany, he must no longer be dependent on the North Atlantic bloc.

"Frankfurter Rundschau" wrote: The solution to the German question "can only be the establishment of a European collective security system, the universal renunciation of the use of force, and the dissolution of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact."

"Industrie-Kurier," reflecting the views of West German business circles, hopes that Adenauer's trip to Moscow will promote "the establishment of contacts between the two countries and the easing of international tensions."

The fact that the sentiment demanding reconciliation between the two parts of Germany is growing is also reflected in many newspaper comments. "Fuldaer Volkszeitung," "Frankfurter Rundschau," "Badisches Tagblatt," and many other newspapers believe that the time for negotiations between East and West Germany is ripe, and that West Germany should have taken steps to seek reconciliation long ago, as the German Democratic Republic has done.

Some West German newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude shown by the West German government so far. For example, the West German weekly "Der Spiegel" pointed out that Adenauer is clinging to the Paris Agreements, and at the same time, Bonn's official propaganda is already blaming the Soviet Union, even before the Moscow talks have begun, saying that the talks will not have positive results. In view of these facts, the weekly expressed doubt as to whether Adenauer is truly prepared to conduct serious negotiations in Moscow.

    德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳到达莫斯科
    西德舆论要求阿登纳执行符合德国人民利益的政策
    新华社八日讯塔斯社莫斯科讯：应苏联政府的邀请，德意志联邦共和国政府代表团在联邦总理阿登纳率领下在八日到达莫斯科。
    前往欢迎阿登纳和代表团的有：布尔加宁、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛，苏联最高苏维埃联盟院外交委员会主席苏斯洛夫，对外贸易部长卡巴诺夫，外交部副部长葛罗米柯、谢苗诺夫和其他官员以及苏联和外国新闻界的代表。
    欢迎阿登纳和代表团的还有驻莫斯科的外交使团团长、瑞典大使索尔曼和美国、英国、法国驻苏大使。
    新华社柏林七日电在西德总理阿登纳访问莫斯科的前夕，西德舆论越来越多地发出了清醒的呼声，要求阿登纳执行符合德国人民利益的政策。
    社会民主党的青年组织“鹰团”发表了一封公开信，要求阿登纳到莫斯科的时候记住：“他的政策必须首先服务于德国人民的利益，而不是把西方国家的指示放在前面”，并且要求阿登纳采取一个明智的政策来作出贡献，而不要被历史记载为主张分裂德国的主要罪人。
    西德金融界报纸“政治经济学者报”在三日发表的关于阿登纳访问莫斯科的评论中指出：如果阿登纳真正关心德国的重新统一，他必须不再依附北大西洋集团。
    “法兰克福评论报”写道：德国问题的解决办法“只能是建立欧洲集体安全体系、普遍放弃使用武力和解散北大西洋公约组织和华沙联盟。”
    反映西德企业界人士意见的“工业快报”希望阿登纳的莫斯科之行将促进“建立两国之间的接触和缓和国际紧张局势”。
    关于要求德国东西两部和解的情绪日益增长的事实也在许多报纸评论中得到反映。“孚尔达人民新闻”、“法兰克福评论报”、“巴登日报”以及其他许多报纸都认为：东西德之间举行谈判的时机已经成熟了，西德早就应该像德意志民主共和国那样采取寻求和解的步骤。
    有一些西德报纸对西德政府迄今表现的态度表示不满，例如，西德“明镜”周刊指出，阿登纳抓住巴黎协定不放，同时，波恩的官方宣传甚至在莫斯科会谈开始之前就已经在责备苏联说什么这次会谈不会有积极结果。鉴于这些事实，这家周刊对阿登纳是否真正准备在莫斯科认真进行谈判表示怀疑。
