Comrades, our Chinese brothers and sisters!

    First of all, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to you for inviting the Soviet Youth Delegation to attend this outstanding congress.

    We are excited to extend our warmest congratulations to the participants of the Chinese Youth Congress of Active Builders of Socialism, and through you, to the mighty army of glorious Chinese youth, on the achievements you, the people, have made in the cause of building a new China.

    We are very happy to convey warm fraternal greetings to you and all Chinese youth on behalf of the Soviet youth.

    We know with what enormous enthusiasm the great Chinese people and the heroic Chinese youth, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are fighting to build the foundations of socialism in China and to realize the First Five-Year Plan.

    These days we have personally witnessed the great construction that is widely unfolding throughout China, from the heavy industrial heartland of the Northeast to the remote Tibet, from the mineral-rich Northwest to the fertile East China and South China. Beside the blast furnaces of Anshan, in the coal mines of Fuxin and Fushun, in the oil fields of Yumen, on the construction sites of the First Automobile Factory and the First Tractor Factory, in the rice paddies of Sichuan, everywhere there are advanced workers and labor models emerging, everywhere there is displayed the diligence, wisdom, and high creative initiative of the free laborers of the new China.

    Encouraged by Comrade Mao Zedong's call to "have a good body, study well, and work well," the Chinese youth are at the forefront of the effort to fulfill the Five-Year Plan. They have turned the slogan "Everything for Socialism" into the highest goal of their lives.

    Together with you, we are proud of the heroic labor and bold creation shown by the young heroes who have emerged in the implementation of the Five-Year Plan—steelworker Wang Hongshun, lathe planer Wang Chonglun, coal miner Wang Hengcheng, young train driver Sun Shigui, youth shock brigade leader steel bar worker Zhang Baifa, textile worker Huang Baomei, rice bumper harvest expert Huang Haicheng, cooperative director Hu Zhaokun, young animal husbandry workers Tursunniyazi and Hua Yinfeng, doctor Jin Zhendu, and other glorious sons and daughters of the great Chinese people. Together with you, we say, "The youth of new China can move mountains and drain seas." This inspiring sentence correctly expresses the heroic labor spirit of the Chinese youth.

    Our young men and women are proud of the heroic undertakings of our Chinese brothers and sisters.

    The Soviet youth heartily congratulate their Chinese youth friends on their great achievements in life and in the cause of building their socialist motherland.

    Dear Comrades!

    The Soviet youth fully understand that it is the greatest happiness to be a builder of a new society and to dedicate all one's strength and knowledge to the cause of the prosperity of the motherland. The Soviet youth and the Lenin Communist Youth League, with its millions of members, have, under the leadership of the Communist Party, acquired many glorious traditions during the years of our struggle for the victory of socialism in our country. The young heroes of the first Soviet Five-Year Plans responded to the Party's call, established new cities in remote jungles, built new roads in high mountains and deserts, and held high the banner of socialist competition. These outstanding traditions are being carried forward year by year. The spirit of these glorious traditions fills the daily life of Soviet youth today.

    As you probably know, our Fifth Five-Year Plan’s total industrial output target was completed ahead of schedule in four years and four months. This year, our country's industrial level has increased more than twofold compared with pre-war 1940. Huge hydropower stations such as Kuibyshev, Gorky, and Kakhovka will soon be generating electricity. The generating capacity of all the hydropower stations under construction in our country will be twice as large as the generating capacity of all the hydropower stations in the country at the beginning of 1954.

    The plan formulated by our Party for the rapid improvement of agriculture is being successfully implemented. This year, the sown area of ​​spring crops in our country has increased by 21 million hectares compared with last year. Collective farms and state farms have all achieved bumper harvests this year.

    The young men and women in factories, mines, and construction projects, and the young laborers in the fields of collective farms, inspired by the idea of ​​building a communist society, are dedicating their abundant energy and all their youthful enthusiasm to the great cause of consolidating the economic power of their motherland.

    Many production innovators and advanced producers have emerged from the Communist Youth League members and the youth masses. Grigory Pomyadun, a steelworker at the "Zaporozhstal Steel Plant," successfully mastered the fast steelmaking method using oxygen. Gainaki Seying, a young coal mining combine driver from Kazakhstan and a member of our delegation, has shown himself to be a model of good use of new technology and increased coal production. Many people are learning the rapid oil well drilling method of Alexander Tsirkov, an oil driller from Bashkir, who is also in this hall now. In the textile industry, the advanced experience of Serafima Kotova, a spinning girl at the Moscow Kalinin Spinning Mill, who initiated a campaign to discover and fully utilize production potential, is being promoted. Many railway train drivers are learning from train driver Viktor Pisklovni, who is attending this conference. He is driving high-speed, extra-axle trains even under the severe conditions of the Arctic Circle.

    We are happy for our achievements. But we cannot fail to see that there are still many shortcomings in our work, in the development of industry, agriculture, and our entire economy and culture. The people of our country and all Soviet youth, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are making every effort to overcome these shortcomings and difficulties and strive for greater achievements.

    The Communist Party has set new and great tasks for workers in Soviet industry, requiring them to make more persistent technological progress, improve labor organization, and, on this basis, achieve a new upsurge in industry.

    Many new and militant initiatives have emerged among young people. Communist Youth League members from the "Red Sormovo" factory in Gorky City are actively participating in the production rationalization movement. The youth of the Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Factory and the First Ball Bearing Factory in Moscow have begun to march for culture and cleanliness in their factories. The young workers of the Ural Machinery Manufacturing Plant have done a lot of work to promote advanced experiences, striving to ensure that every young man and woman masters advanced experiences.

    Our young people understand that the happiness of struggle and labor is the true happiness in life. A person can only grow and become stronger in labor and in practical work. Because of this, the Soviet young men and women are not afraid of difficulties and bravely go to the most important positions of communist construction. Everyone knows that our youth are playing a very important role in reclaiming virgin and fallow land. More than 300,000 young patriots responded to the Party's call and participated in land reclamation. Hundreds of new state farms have been established on the boundless grasslands of Altai and Kazakhstan. The young people who have settled there have already harvested millions of poods of grain from the reclaimed land. Young patriots started their lives in harsh conditions, on barren land. But the youth everywhere showed enthusiasm, courage, firmness and perseverance.

    Last year, the Party and the Soviet government passed a decision on the construction of 400 reinforced concrete structure factories. These factories are of great significance to the new upsurge in the construction industry. According to the initiative of the youth of Sverdlovsk City, the construction of these factories was declared as a youth shock project, and nearly 18,000 young patriots have gone to participate in the construction of these factories. This year, more than 50,000 Communist Youth League members and young people have been dispatched to participate in the construction of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad Hydropower Stations and railways, and to participate in coal mining work.

    Being proficient in one's business, highly mastering technology, and achieving new achievements in labor every day is the aspiration of all our young men and women. Because of this, the youth of our country are studying with high enthusiasm, mastering technology and production knowledge, and improving their culture. Dear Comrades!

    The Chinese people are not isolated in the struggle to successfully build socialism. Standing with you are the Soviet Union and the entire democratic and socialist camp.

    The friendship between the peoples of our two countries, forged in the struggle for peaceful construction, is unbreakable. The economic and cultural ties between our two countries are strengthening every day. This relationship is based on complete equality, mutual respect for national interests, and sincere desire for mutual assistance and striving for common economic prosperity.

    The ever-developing economic and cultural ties between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union clearly demonstrate the profound brotherly love of our two peoples and their ardent desire to increasingly strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship.

    The youth of our two countries are also linked by noble friendship. This friendship is manifested in all aspects, manifested in the great unity of the youth of our two countries in the struggle for the happiness of our two peoples.

    The members of the Soviet Youth Delegation who came to your country are here with great interest to learn about the labor achievements of the Chinese brothers and sisters, and carefully study their experiences. Our delegation is participating in this conference with extreme excitement. We are willing to introduce our experiences and will carefully study all the advanced new things you have accumulated so that we can take them back and apply them.

    Dear Comrades, Friends!

    The youth of the Soviet Union and China all understand that only a peaceful and constructive life is the guarantee of their happy future. In order to build and beautify our cities and villages, in order to turn deserts into beautiful gardens, in order to master high science and technology, in order to create human happiness with our own hands, we must have peace. Therefore, the youth of our two countries resolutely oppose war. The young men and women of our two countries are working selflessly to further consolidate the power of our country, and they are using this labor to confirm their desire for peace and happiness.

    Dear Comrades!

    The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League has entrusted our delegation to convey the following message to the Chinese Youth Congress of Active Builders of Socialism:

    "The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, on behalf of the Leninist Young Communist League and all Soviet youth, extends warm congratulations to all participants of the Chinese Youth Congress of Active Builders of Socialism.

    The Chinese youth, nurtured by the Chinese Communist Party, are building a new life with great enthusiasm and high confidence in victory, dedicating their strength and knowledge to the cause of socialist construction.

    The heroic undertakings of the Chinese younger generation make Soviet youth rejoice.

    With full brotherly friendship, the Soviet young men and women wish you, dear friends, new and glorious victories in the struggle for the prosperity of the great motherland.

    Long live the glorious Chinese youth – an active force in socialist construction!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China! Let the friendship between the youth of our two countries become even more consolidated and developed!

    The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League"

    在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上
    苏联青年代表团团长扎鲁日尼的祝词亲爱的同志们，我们的中国兄弟姐妹们！
    首先让我衷心地感谢你们邀请苏联青年代表团出席你们这次卓越的大会。
    我们兴奋地向中国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的参加者，并通过你们向浩浩荡荡的全体光荣的中国青年大军，对你们人民在建设新中国的事业中所取得的成就，表示最热诚的祝贺。
    我们非常高兴地代表苏联青年男女向你们和全体中国青年致热烈的兄弟的问候。
    我们知道，伟大的中国人民和英勇的中国青年以多么巨大的热情在共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的英明领导下，为了在中国建成社会主义基础，为了实现第一个五年计划而进行着斗争。
    这些日子我们亲眼看见了全中国广泛展开的巨大建设，从重工业的心脏东北到遥远的西藏，从矿藏丰富的西北到土地肥沃的华东和华南都在进行着这样的建设。在鞍山的高炉旁，在阜新和抚顺的煤矿里，在玉门的石油场中，在第一汽车厂和第一拖拉机厂的工地上，在四川的稻田里，到处都涌现出先进工人和劳动模范，到处都显示出新中国的自由的劳动者的勤劳、智慧和高度的创造积极性。
    中国青年在毛泽东同志号召“身体好，学习好，工作好”的鼓舞下，走在争取完成五年计划的队伍的前列。他们把“一切为着社会主义”的口号变成了自己生活的最高目标。
    我们和你们一起，为了在实现五年计划中所涌现出的青年英雄们——钢铁工人王洪顺、车刨工王崇伦、煤矿工人王恒成、青年火车司机孙士贵、青年突击队队长钢筋工人张百发、纺织工人黄宝妹、水稻丰产能手黄海澄、合作社主任胡兆坤、青年养畜工作者吐尔逊尼牙孜和华银凤、医师金镇都和伟大中国人民的其他光荣儿女所表现的英勇劳动和大胆创造而感到骄傲。我们和你们一起说“新中国青年可以移山倒海”。这句令人鼓舞的话，正确地表达了中国青年英勇劳动的气概。
    我国青年男女以中国兄弟姐妹们的英勇事业而骄傲。
    苏联青年衷心祝贺中国青年朋友们在生活、在建设社会主义祖国的事业中获得巨大的成就。
    亲爱的同志们！
    苏联青年完全了解，做一个新社会的建设者，把自己的一切力量和知识贡献给祖国繁荣的事业，这是最大的幸福。苏联青年和拥有千百万团员的列宁共产主义青年团，在我国为社会主义的胜利而进行斗争的年代中，在共产党的领导下有了许多光荣的传统。苏联最初几个五年计划时期的青年英雄们响应党的号召，在偏僻的丛林里建立了新的城市，在高山和沙漠中建设了新的道路，并且高高地举起了社会主义竞赛的旗帜。这些卓越的传统正在一年一年的发扬光大。现在苏联青年的日常生活中也充满这些光荣传统的精神。
    你们大概知道，我们第五个五年计划中工业的总产量计划已经在四年又四个月的时间中提前完成。今年我国工业水平和战前一九四○年相比增加了二倍多。像古比雪夫、高尔基和卡霍夫卡等巨大的水电站不久就将发电。我国正在建设的全部水电站的发电能力将比一九五四年年初全国水电站的发电能力大二倍。
    我们的党所制定的急速提高农业的计划正在顺利地实现。今年我国春播作物的播种面积比去年增加了二千一百万公顷。集体农庄和国营农场今年都得到了丰收。
    工厂、矿山和建筑工程中的青年男女，集体农庄田野上的青年劳动者，被建设共产主义社会的思想所鼓舞，把自己的充沛精力和自己的全部青春热情贡献给巩固自己祖国经济威力的伟大事业。
    从共青团员和青年群众中出现了许许多多生产革新者和先进生产者。“萨波罗什钢铁厂”的炼钢工人格里高里·波姆雅东顺利地掌握了使用氧气的快速炼钢法。哈萨克的青年采煤联合机司机、我们代表团的团员——盖那其·谢英表现为善于使用新技术和增加采煤量的模范。许多人正在学习巴什基尔的石油钻井工人亚历山大·齐尔可夫的油井快速钻凿法，他现在也在这个大厅中。纺织工业中正在推广莫斯科加里宁纺纱厂的纺纱女工赛拉费玛·科托娃的先进经验，她发起了挖掘和充分利用生产潜力的运动。许多铁路火车司机向出席这次大会的火车司机维克多·彼斯克洛夫尼看齐。他即使在北极圈严寒条件下也在驾驶快速超轴列车。
    我们为我们的成就而高兴。但是我们也不能不看到在我们的工作中，在工业、农业和我们整个经济和文化的发展中还存在着许多缺点。我国人民和全体苏联青年，在共产党的领导下正在尽一切努力去克服这些缺点和困难，争取更大的成就。
    共产党给苏维埃工业方面的劳动者提出了新的巨大任务，要求他们更加顽强地取得在技术上的进步，改进劳动组织并在这个基础上使工业达到新的高涨。
    青年中已出现了许多新的富有战斗性的创举，高尔基市“红色索尔莫伏”工厂的共青团员积极参加了生产合理化运动。莫斯科的奥尔忠尼启则机床制造厂和第一钢珠轴承工厂的青年们开始为自己工厂中的文化和整洁而进军。乌拉尔机器制造厂的青年工人为了推广先进经验做了很多工作，争取使每一个青年男女都掌握先进经验。
    我们的青年懂得，斗争和劳动的幸福是生活中的真正幸福。一个人只有在劳动中，在实际的工作中才能成长和壮大起来。正因为这样，所以苏联青年男女不怕困难，勇敢地走向最重要的共产主义建设岗位。大家都知道，我们的青年在开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作中是起着非常重要的作用的。三十多万青年爱国者响应党的号召参加了开荒。在阿尔泰和哈萨克的一望无际的草原上建立了成百个新的国营农场。新在那儿定居下来的青年们已经从开垦出来的土地上收获了几百万普特的粮食。青年爱国者在艰苦的条件下，在荒地上开始了自己的生活。但是青年们到处都表现出热情勇敢和坚毅顽强。
    去年党和苏维埃政府通过了一个关于建设四百个钢筋混凝土结构工厂的决定。这些工厂对建筑业的新高涨具有重大的意义。根据斯维特洛夫斯克市的青年们的倡议，这些工厂的建筑工程被宣布为青年突击工程，将近一万八千名青年爱国者已经去参加这些工厂的建设。今年被派去参加古比雪夫、斯大林格勒水电站和铁路的建设和参加煤矿工作的共青团员和青年已有五万多名。
    精通自己的业务，高度掌握技术，每天都在劳动中取得新的成就，这是我们全体青年男女的志愿。正因为这样，我国青年以高度的热情进行着学习，掌握技术和生产知识，提高自己的文化。亲爱的同志们！
    中国人民在顺利地建设社会主义的斗争中不是孤立的。和你们站在一起的有苏联和整个民主和社会主义阵营。
    在和平建设的斗争中锻炼出来的我们两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的。我们两国的经济和文化联系每天都在加强，这种联系是建立在完全平等，互相尊重民族利益的基础上的，是建立在互相帮助、争取共同的经济高涨的真诚愿望上的。
    中华人民共和国和苏联两国之间日益发展着的经济和文化联系明显地证明了我们两国人民的深厚的手足之情和他们要求日益加强中苏友谊的热烈愿望。
    我们两国的青年也是由崇高的友谊联系在一起的。这种友谊表现在各个方面，表现在我们两国青年为我们两国人民的幸福而进行斗争时的伟大团结中。
    来到你们国家的苏联青年代表却带着极大的兴趣来了解中国兄弟姐妹们的劳动成就，仔细学习中国兄弟姐妹们的经验。我们代表团参加这次大会也带着极其兴奋的心情，我们愿意介绍自己的经验，将仔细学习你们积累起来的一切先进的新的东西，以便带回去加以采用。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    苏联和中国的青年都懂得，只有和平的建设性的生活才是他们的幸福前途的保证。为了建设和美化我们的城市和乡村，为了把沙漠变成美丽的花园，为了掌握高度的科学技术，为了用自己的双手创造人类的幸福，我们必须要和平。因此我们两国的青年坚决反对战争。我们两国青年男女为了进一步巩固我们国家的威力进行着忘我的劳动，他们用这种劳动来证实自己要求和平和幸福的愿望。
    亲爱的同志们！
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会委托我们代表团向中国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会转达下面的祝词：
    “苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会代表列宁共产主义青年团和全体苏联青年向中国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的全体参加者表示热烈的祝贺。
    由中国共产党教养起来的中国青年带着巨大的热情和对于胜利的高度信心建设着新的生活，把自己的力量和知识贡献给社会主义建设事业。
    中国青年一代的英勇事业使苏联青年感到欢欣鼓舞。
    苏联青年男女怀着满腔兄弟般的友情祝你们，亲爱的朋友们，在为伟大祖国的繁荣昌盛的斗争中得到新的、光辉的胜利。
    光荣的中国青年——社会主义建设者积极力量万岁！
    苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！让我们两国青年的友谊更加巩固和发展起来！
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会”
