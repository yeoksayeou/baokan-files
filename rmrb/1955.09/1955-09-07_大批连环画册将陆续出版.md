A large number of comic books will be published successively.

    The People's Fine Arts Publishing House and the Morning Flower Fine Arts Publishing House have published a large number of comic books. Statistics for the first half of this year show that more than 90 new books have been published, with a total circulation of more than 5 million copies, including reprints.

    These comic books have penetrated factories, rural areas, and cities, and are very popular among readers, playing a broad role in publicity and education. Some comic books closely cooperate with the current struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, showing the people's high political vigilance and powerfully striking the dying reactionary classes, such as "The Crimes of the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," "How Hou Hong'e Fell into the Quagmire of Counter-Revolution," "Severing the Devil's Claws," "The Dragnet," "Eliminating Pirates," and "Mountain Outpost" and "Silver-Gray Powder" adapted from Soviet films. Some comic books are based on the new people and new things on the industrial and agricultural production fronts of the motherland, depicting the struggle between new and old ideas, such as "Mining Banner," "Combine Harvesters Arrive in Donbass," "Cannot Take That Road," "Female Chairman of the Collective Farm," and so on. There are also some that depict the combat stories in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, such as "The Battle of Shajiadian," "Sons and Daughters on the Huai River," "Green Hill Red Flag," "Reconnaissance Across the River," "Internationalist Soldier Shi Yuanhou," and so on. Historical biographies and classical literary masterpieces are also the main sources of comic book material. The entire set of twenty-one volumes of "Water Margin" has successively published eleven volumes. Children's colored comic books, such as "A Young Pioneer," "Little Peace Warrior," "Seryozha Studying," "The Emperor's New Clothes," "Strange Fire," etc., have become the closest partners of children.

    The two publishing houses will continue to publish a large number of comic books in the second half of this year to play a more powerful role in banning obscene publications.

    大批连环画册将陆续出版
    人民美术出版社和朝花美术出版社出版了大批连环画册，本年上半年统计已出版新书九十多种，连再版共发行五百多万册。
    这些连环画册，深入到工厂农村和各个城市，很受读者欢迎，起了广泛的宣传教育作用。有些画册紧密地配合了当前的肃清一切反革命分子的斗争，表现了祖国人民高度的政治警惕性，对垂死的反动阶级作了有力的打击，如“胡风反革命集团的罪行”、“侯红鹅是怎样掉进反革命的泥坑”、“斩断魔爪”、“天罗地网”、“消灭海盗”和根据苏联电影改编的“山中防哨”、“银灰色的粉末”等。有些画册取材于祖国工农业生产战线上的新人新事，描写了新旧思想的斗争，如“矿山旗手”、“康拜因到了顿巴斯”、“不能走那条路”、“集体农庄女主席”等。还有些是描写抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝战争中的战斗故事的，例如“沙家店战斗”、“淮河边上的儿女”、“翠岗红旗”、“渡江侦察记”、“国际主义战士史元厚”等。历史传记和古典文学名著，也是连环画取材的主要来源。全套二十一集的“水浒传”已陆续出版了十一集。儿童彩色连环画册，如“一个少先队员”、“和平小战士”、“谢辽莎温课”、“皇帝的新衣”、“怪火”等，都成了小朋友们最亲密的伙伴。
    这两个出版社今年下半年还将继续出版大量的连环画册，以对取缔黄色书刊起更有力的作用。
