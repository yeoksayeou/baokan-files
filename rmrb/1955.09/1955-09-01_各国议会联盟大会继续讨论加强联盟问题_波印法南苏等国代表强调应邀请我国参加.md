Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, August 31st: The Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference continued its discussions on strengthening the Union at its morning session on August 30th, according to TASS.

    Israeli representative Nurok spoke first, saying that parliamentarians from all countries bear a great responsibility for the fate of the world. The Inter-Parliamentary Union should promote the easing of international tensions and the consolidation of peace.
    American representative Pesha's speech did not address the substance of the issue. He talked about disarmament and the supervision of disarmament, and about the "lack of freedom" in other countries.
    Brazilian representative Salesa advocated strengthening the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
    Polish representative Żółkiewski said in his speech that the activities of the Inter-Parliamentary Union have promoted and will continue to promote mutual understanding and rapprochement between countries. He said that our Union should be universal in nature, and we regret that the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic have not had the opportunity to participate in the work of this conference. He said that no one can legally defend those who made this improper decision. We cannot agree to be without representatives of the great nation of China among us. Nor can we discuss the German issue without the participation of representatives from the German Democratic Republic. The Polish delegation believes that these issues should be re-examined correctly. Doing so will only enhance the prestige of the Union.
    Indian representative Sinha said that the proposal to expand the membership of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is in line with the aims of the Union. He said that we should not be biased when admitting new member states, otherwise the principles of our Union will be undermined, as happened in the discussion of admitting China to the Union.
    French representative Hamon criticized some representatives for trying to study the issues at this meeting in an extremely narrow-minded way, and criticized them for speaking rudely and insultingly. Hamon said that our failure to accept China into the Union is illogical. The Executive Committee's decision regarding China's participation in the Union is unsatisfactory. This decision should be revised in order to enhance the prestige of our Union.
    Yugoslav representative Simic, Sudanese representative Guballa, and others also supported the proposal to accept China into the Union.
    Soviet representative M. Tursun-Zade then spoke. He noted with satisfaction that the resolution put forward by the Council gave a good evaluation of the declaration made by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on establishing direct ties between the parliaments of various countries. He said that the Soviet government is implementing this declaration: parliamentary delegations from many countries have already had the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union and gain a broad understanding of the lives and realities of our people.
    Tursun-Zade said that Chairman Stansgate's statement that the Inter-Parliamentary Union must be universal in nature is of great significance.
    Tursun-Zade pointed out that the absence of representatives of 600 million Chinese people in the Inter-Parliamentary Union is contrary to the principles on which the Union's work is based. The majority of representatives who spoke at the meeting expressed their opinions in support of accepting the People's Republic of China into the Inter-Parliamentary Union. These opinions cannot be ignored. He concluded by pointing out that there are still many unresolved issues at the conference, and the solution of these issues awaits the joint efforts of parliamentarians from all countries.
    The conference then began to discuss the development of international economic exchange. A report on this issue was given by Sind, a representative of the Finance and Economics Committee. The rapporteur suggested holding an international economic conference to discuss some pressing issues in international economic relations, thereby promoting trust between countries.
    Sudanese representative Hal-Ghani, who spoke on this issue, put forward some amendments. In his opinion, these amendments would help the economic development of backward countries. He hoped that the international economic conference would be held quickly, believing that it would be a major contribution to international cooperation and mutual understanding.
    This issue is still under discussion.

    各国议会联盟大会继续讨论加强联盟问题
    波印法南苏等国代表强调应邀请我国参加
    新华社三十一日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：各国议会联盟大会三十日上午会议继续讨论关于加强联盟的问题。
    以色列代表努罗克首先发言，他说，各国议员对世界的命运负有重大的责任。各国议会联盟应当促成国际紧张局势的缓和与和平的巩固。
    美国代表佩夏的发言没有涉及问题的实质。他谈到裁军和监督裁军的问题，并谈到在其他国家中“缺乏自由”的情况。
    巴西代表萨莱萨主张加强各国议会联盟。
    波兰代表茹尔凯夫斯基在发言中说，各国议会联盟的活动在过去促成了，今后还将促成各国间的相互谅解和接近。他说，我们的联盟应当具有普遍的性质，我们所感到遗憾的是：中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国还没有机会参加本届大会的工作。他说，谁也不能在法律上为那些作出这一不正当的决定的人辩护。我们不能同意在我们之间没有伟大国家——中国的代表。我们也不能在没有德意志民主共和国代表参加的情况下讨论德国问题。波兰代表团认为，这些问题应该重新加以正确的讨论。这样做只会加强联盟的威信。
    印度代表辛哈谈到，扩充各国议会联盟成员的建议是符合联盟的宗旨的。他说，我们在吸收新会员国时不应该抱有偏见，否则我们联盟的原则就会遭到破坏，在讨论吸收中国参加联盟的问题上就发生了这种情况。
    法国的阿蒙批评一些代表企图极其偏狭地研究这次会议上的问题，批评他们说话粗鲁和带有侮辱性。阿蒙说，我们不接受中国参加联盟，这是不合逻辑的。执行委员会关于中国参加联盟的决定是不能令人满意的。应该修改这一决定，这样才能提高我们联盟的威信。
    南斯拉夫代表西米茨、苏丹代表古巴拉等人也支持接受中国参加联盟的建议。
    苏联代表米·图尔逊—查德接着发言。他满意地指出，理事会提出的决议案对苏联最高苏维埃发表的关于建立各国议会之间的直接联系的宣言作了良好的评价。他说，苏联政府正在实现着这一宣言：许多国家的议会代表团已经有机会访问了苏联和广泛了解了我国人民的生活和实际情况。
    图尔逊—查德说，斯坦斯盖特主席所说的关于各国议会联盟必须具有普遍的性质这一句话，是具有重大意义的。
    图尔逊—查德指出，在各国议会联盟中没有六亿中国人民的代表，这是违背联盟工作所依据的原则的。会上发言的大多数代表都发表了意见，支持接受中华人民共和国参加各国议会联盟的建议。对这些意见不能忽视。他最后指出，现在还有许多大会上没有解决的问题，这些问题的解决还有待各国议会议员的共同努力。
    接着大会开始讨论关于发展国际间的经济交流的问题。就这一问题做报告的是财经委员会代表辛德。报告人建议举行一次国际经济会议来讨论国际经济联系上的一些迫切问题，从而促进各国之间的信任。
    就这一问题发言的苏丹代表半尔加尼提出了一些修正。根据他的意见，这些修正会有助于落后国家的经济发展。他希望迅速地举行国际经济会议，认为这一会议将会是对国际合作和互相谅解的一个重大贡献。
    这一问题在继续讨论中。
