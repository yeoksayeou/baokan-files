Most central-level agencies have formulated new staffing plans.

The new staffing plans of various central-level agencies were formulated based on a study of the scope of business and working methods of the respective units. Therefore, in the new staffing plans of each unit, phenomena such as unclear business scope, unclear responsibilities, overlapping institutions, and duplication of work have been initially eliminated, and many dispensable institutions have been streamlined; only a very few newly established units that need to expand their business scope have expanded some institutions and staffing as needed. When formulating new staffing plans, many units separated institutions of a business or enterprise nature from the administrative staffing, which allows the central-level agencies to get rid of some specific administrative work and concentrate on considering overall leadership work. The intermediate levels in the new staffing of each unit have also been greatly reduced. Most units have decided to change from the past four-level or five-level system to a two-level or three-level system, and only a few units implement a four-level system due to business needs. According to the new staffing plans of eighteen units such as the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Justice, the number of divisions and sections has been reduced by more than 30%. The number of divisions, sections, and groups in some units has been reduced by more than 50%.

According to the new staffing plans, central-level agencies will also transfer a large number of staff to replenish local agencies at all levels and grassroots production units. According to the statistics of eighteen units such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, the number of people in the new staffing is more than 40% less than the original staffing. The number of non-business personnel has been reduced even more. The service personnel in general units have been reduced by more than half. The ratio of service personnel to cadres has reached 1:15, and some units have reached 1:18. Among these transferred staff, a considerable number are leading cadres above the section level, technical personnel, and university graduates. After the Ministry of Fuel Industry was abolished, in addition to supplying all the staff of the newly established Ministry of Coal Industry, Ministry of Electric Power Industry, and Ministry of Petroleum Industry, more than 900 people are prepared to be transferred to grassroots units of the coal, electric power, petroleum and other industrial systems, including more than 90 cadres at the division and section level, more than 220 technical cadres, and nearly 200 university graduates. Among the staff transferred from the Central Meteorological Bureau and other units, 79 people have already left Beijing in late August to participate in work in Xinjiang.

In the process of compiling new staffing plans, central-level agencies have combined this with studying the issue of improving work. Many units have put forward specific methods for improving work and formulated new work systems. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stipulates that the method of holding office meetings to study problems in a timely manner should be used to reduce the procedures for transmitting and issuing official documents, which saves time and improves work efficiency. The Ministry of Forestry reduced the procedures for reviewing official documents from the past eight times to three times, and stipulated that important official documents should be drafted by leading cadres themselves, which can not only simplify work procedures, save manpower and time, but also overcome the shortcomings of rework in official documents and improve work quality and efficiency. The Ministry of Light Industry abolished more than 110 types of reports and simplified 50 types of reports. The Ministry of Construction Engineering originally planned to hold 71 meetings from April to December this year. After preliminary research, the number was reduced to 38. These measures will greatly save manpower, materials, and financial resources, so as to concentrate on doing the main business work. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 中央一级机关大部分制定新的编制方案

    中央一级机关大部分制定新的编制方案
    中央一级机关大部分单位的新的编制方案都已经制定出来。
    中央一级机关各单位的新编制方案，都是在研究了本单位的业务范围和工作方法的基础上制定出来的。所以，在各单位的新的编制方案中，已初步消除了业务范围不清、职责不明、机构重叠、工作重复的现象，精简了许多可有可无的机构；只有极个别需要扩大业务范围的新建单位，才根据需要扩充了一些机构和编制。许多单位在制定新的编制方案时，都把事业、企业性质的机构从行政编制中划出，这就可以使中央一级机关摆脱一些具体的事务工作，便于集中力量考虑全盘的领导工作。各单位的新编制中，中间层次也大大减少。大多数单位都确定由过去的四级制或五级制改成二级制或三级制，只有少数单位因业务需要实行四级制。根据水利部、司法部等十八个单位的新编制方案统计，处、科级机构减少百分之三十以上。有些单位的处、科、组减少百分之五十以上。
    按照新的编制方案，中央一级机关还将抽调大批工作人员，去充实各级地方机构和基层生产单位。根据内务部、农业部等十八个单位的统计，新编制人数比原编制人数减少百分之四十以上。非业务人员减少的数量更大，一般单位的服务人员都减少一半以上。服务人员和干部的比例达到一比十五，有些单位达到一比十八。这些被抽调出来的工作人员中，有相当部分是科级以上的领导骨干、技术人员和高等学校毕业生。燃料工业部撤销后，除了供给新成立的煤炭工业部、电力工业部、石油工业部三个部的全体工作人员外，准备下调到煤炭、电力、石油等工业系统的基层单位去的有九百多人，其中有处、科长以上干部九十多人，技术干部二百二十多人，高等学校毕业生近二百人。从中央气象局等单位抽调出来的工作人员中，已有七十九人在八月下旬离开北京到新疆去参加工作。
    中央一级机关在编制新的编制方案过程中，都结合研究了改进工作问题。许多单位提出了改进工作的具体办法，制定了新的工作制度。外交部规定用举行办公会议及时研究问题的办法，来减少公文传递签发手续，既节省时间，又能提高工作效率。林业部把公文核稿的手续由过去的八次减为三次，并规定重要公文由领导干部亲自拟稿，不仅可以简化工作程序，节省人力和时间，而且可以克服公文返工的缺点，提高工作质量和效率。轻工业部废止了一百一十多种报表，简化了五十种报表。建筑工程部今年四月到十二月份原计划召开七十一次会议，经过初步研究后，核减为三十八次。这些措施都将大大地节省人力、物力、财力，以便集中精力做好主要业务工作。（新华社）
