Watching the Performance of the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe in Beijing
You Huihai, Director of the Chinese Dance Research Association

The Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe came to our country for a visit and performance after participating in the Fifth World Festival of Youth and Students in Poland. This is a good opportunity for artistic workers from China and Vietnam to exchange friendship and artistic experience.

We felt extremely excited after watching the performance of the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe. The simple and sincere emotions of the people's life and the proud heroic spirit of fighting for national liberation, which were concentratedly expressed in the artistic images they created, deeply moved us.

The dance programs of the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe truly reflect the life and character of the Vietnamese people. From those vivid characters, we can appreciate the noble qualities of the Vietnamese people: kindness, optimism, love of labor, wisdom, and bravery.

"The Flower-Snatching Dance" is a lively and beautiful folk dance. In the crowd attending a temple fair, a colorful flower stick is thrown back and forth in the air, and robust young men constantly rush to snatch the flower stick with their wit and courage. The winner wins the love of the elderly and the girls. The dance is full of a cheerful and optimistic atmosphere from beginning to end. Especially those fast and flexible movements in the process of snatching the flower stick strongly attract the audience. The ending of the dance uses rather unique clappers and lotus lanterns to celebrate the victory of winning the flower stick, in order to express the joyful emotions of these young people during the festival. The brisk movements of the person blowing the bugle interspersed in the dance, the wrestling matches of the young people, and the performances of the elderly add to the interest of the dance, making the whole dance look like a moving folk custom painting.

In "The Joy of Production Dance," what we see are the images of some hardworking people. If you are familiar with rice farming in the South, you can understand the meaning of every movement from the vivid performances of these girls. They focus on expressing the movements of production on the stage—drawing water, sowing seeds, transplanting seedlings, harvesting, and drying grains. They fully express the joy of labor. When the rice is harvested, they bite the grains picked from the ears of rice, and the sweet juice evokes their happy smiles. They delicately and prominently embody the sweetness and bitterness of labor. The steps and movements of this dance are not complicated. The hand movements have distinct characteristics and clearly and concisely convey the theme.

"The Fan Dance" expresses the good wishes and ideals of the Vietnamese people. Eight young girls play with flowers and butterflies in an imagined artistic conception, and flowers and butterflies are symbols of beautiful life and happiness. The girls use the fans and red scarves trembling in their hands to represent the beauty of flowers and butterflies. They chase and praise, immersing us together with these girls in a poetic and wonderful realm. The movements of this dance have national characteristics. The steps, hand movements, and body postures combine into harmonious lines, and the scenes formed in the pauses of the movement sentences are also very beautiful. The dance ends with a full and harmonious picture, giving people a very comfortable feeling.

The Vietnamese people have experienced a long and arduous struggle for the independence and liberation of their nation, and their heroic spirit full of confidence in victory in the struggle is strongly reflected in their artistic creation. This type of program constitutes a prominent feature of their entire performance content, which makes us feel particularly cordial. The strong will to overcome difficulties and the proud spirit after completing tasks, as shown in "The Firecracker Song," deeply touch our hearts. And "The Bamboo Grove Celebration Dance," which takes the close friendship between the people and the army as its theme, excellently expresses the noble qualities of the people's army. The joyful people after the victory dance on the ground intertwined with long bamboo poles. Along with the crisp and uniform sound of the bamboo poles striking each other, people and soldiers of the Muong and Dai ethnic groups held a celebration, alternately dancing dances with ethnic characteristics, fully expressing the exchange of friendly feelings between the military and the people.

Like many literary and art workers in our country, the artists of Vietnam have grown up in a fighting environment. They have gone deep into the lives of the people for a long time and have undergone a lot of training, so that their artistic creations have gained full ideological content and a strong atmosphere of life, and are loved by the people. Vietnamese dancers not only respect and retain the characteristics of national heritage in their creations, but also develop and improve them according to the requirements of new life and new emotions. For example, "The Bamboo Grove Celebration Dance," "The Flower-Snatching Dance," "The Joy of Production Dance," and "The Fan Dance" are all dances created on the basis of national traditional art and have new ideological content.

The Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe demonstrated artistic integrity in their performances. Beautiful folk music with national style gives the dance a rich color. According to the requirements of the theme of each dance, the content of the music also highlights a clear musical image. Those performances with singing and dancing made us feel very cordial. These moving folk music helped us to understand and feel the dance. In terms of stage art, whether it is the clothing design with national characteristics, or the stage background that introduces you to the wonderful realm of life, they all show the talents of Vietnamese artists. Like the sea and coast where the sea breeze blows and the waves shimmer, the uniquely interesting southern bamboo forest, the fertile fields swaying with golden rice ears, and the dense mountains and forests that are adapted to the strong character of the Vietnamese people, all provide actors and audiences with a rich imaginative artistic conception. This unified and integral relationship between various art departments is very prominent in the performance of the song and dance troupe.

The impressions and experiences we gained from the performance of the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe are profound. The cultural exchanges between our two countries have a long history, and the people of the two countries have been closely related in the past and present struggles for national liberation and the creation of a peaceful and happy life. The relationship between the people of the two countries and the relationship between the culture and art of the two countries, which are linked by this combat friendship, are inseparable. The people of the two countries can understand each other in every aspect and resonate warmly!

Let us thank the comrades of the Vietnamese People's Song and Dance Troupe led by Director Liu Zhonglu for their hard work and enthusiasm in promoting friendship and cultural exchange between the two countries, and let our two countries' artists sincerely learn from each other! (Attached picture)

    看越南人民歌舞团在北京的演出
    中国舞蹈研究会理事　游惠海
    越南人民歌舞团在波兰参加了第五届青年与学生联欢节以后来到我国进行访问演出。这是中、越两国艺术工作者交流友谊和艺术经验的好机会。
    看了越南人民歌舞团的演出，我们感到极大的兴奋。在他们创造的艺术形象中集中地表现出来的那种朴实真挚的人民的生活感情和为民族解放而斗争的自豪的英雄气概，深深地感动了我们。
    越南人民歌舞团的舞蹈节目，真实地反映了越南人民的生活和性格。从那些生动的人物形象中，我们体会到越南人民的善良乐观、热爱劳动、智慧、勇敢的高贵品质。
    “抢花舞”是一个活跃的优美的民间舞蹈。在赶庙会的人群中，一根彩色的花棒在空中来回扔掷，健壮的小伙子们川流不息地以自己的机智和勇敢去抢夺这根花棒，胜利的人博得了老年人和姑娘们的爱戴。舞蹈自始至终充满了快活、乐观的气氛，尤其是在抢花棒过程中那些快速的灵活的动作，强烈地吸引着观众。舞蹈的尾段，用了颇为别致的金钱板和荷花灯来庆祝夺得花棒的胜利，以表现这些青年在节日的欢乐情绪。穿插在舞蹈中的吹大号的人的明快的动作，青年人的角力摔交，以及老年人的表演等等，都增添了舞蹈的情趣，使整个舞蹈活像一幅动人的民间风俗画。
    在“生产欢乐舞”中，我们看到的是一些勤劳的人民的形象。如果你是熟悉南方水稻耕作的人，你就可以从这些姑娘生动的表演中领会每一个动作的意义。她们集中地把生产的动作表现在舞台上——戽水、播种、插秧、收割、晒谷子。她们充分表现出劳动的欢乐。当谷子收割的时候，她们咬咬从谷穗上摘下来的谷粒，香甜的浆汁，引起了她们的幸福的微笑。她们细致而凸出地体现了劳动的甘苦。这个舞蹈的步法和动作并不复杂，手的动作具有鲜明的特点，简洁明朗地传达了主题思想。
    “扇子舞”表现了越南人民善良的愿望和理想。八个年青的姑娘，在想像的意境中玩花扑蝶，而花和蝶正是美丽的生命和幸福的象征。姑娘们用自己手中颤动着的扇子和红巾代表花和蝶的美丽，她们追逐着，赞美着，使我们同这些姑娘们一起沉浸在一种诗意的、美妙的境界里。这个舞蹈的动作具有民族特色，步法、手的动作和身体的造型结合成和谐的线条，而在动作句子的停顿中形成的画面也是很美丽的。舞蹈结束于一个饱满的、和谐的画面，给人一种非常舒畅的感觉。
    越南人民为了自己民族的独立解放，经历过长期的艰苦的斗争，而他们在斗争中充满胜利信心的英雄气概，在他们的艺术创作中得到了有力的反映。这类节目构成他们全部演出内容的显著的特点，这使我们特别感到亲切。像在“拉炮歌”中所表现出来的克服困难的坚强意志和完成任务之后的自豪气概，都深深地打动我们的心弦。而以人民和军队的亲密友爱为主题的“竹丛联欢舞”，出色地表现了人民的军队的高贵的品质。胜利后欢乐的人们在交织着长竹竿的地面上跳舞，随着竹竿相互敲击的清脆均匀的音响，芒族、傣族的人民和战士们进行了联欢，交替地跳着富有民族特点的舞蹈，充分地表现了军民之间的友爱情绪的交流。
    正像我国许多文艺工作者一样，越南的艺术家们是在战斗环境中成长起来的。他们长期地深入人民生活，经过很多锻炼，才使他们的艺术创作取得饱满的思想内容和浓厚的生活气息，得到人民的热爱。越南的舞蹈家们不仅在创作中尊重和保留了民族遗产的特色，而且按照新的生活、新的感情的要求加以发展和提高。例如“竹丛联欢舞”、“抢花舞”、“生产欢乐舞”、“扇子舞”等节目，都是在民族传统艺术基础上创作出来的舞蹈，具有新的思想内容。
    越南人民歌舞团在演出中表现了艺术上的整体性。富有民族风格的优美的民间音乐给予舞蹈以丰富的色彩。按着每个舞蹈的主题的要求，乐曲内容也凸现了明朗的音乐形象。那些载歌载舞的表演，使我们感到非常亲切。这些动人的民间音乐，帮助了我们对舞蹈的理解和感受。而在舞台美术方面，不管是那些具有民族特点的服装设计，或者是那些把你引入美妙的生活境界的舞台背景，都显示了越南美术家的才华。像那吹来阵阵海风，波浪闪闪的大海和海岸，别有情趣的南方竹林，摇漾着金色稻穗的丰饶的田野，那些同越南人民坚强的性格相适应的丛山密林等等，都给演员和观众提供了丰富的想像的意境。这种各个艺术部门之间的统一的整体关系，在歌舞团的演出中表现得非常显著。
    从越南人民歌舞团的演出中，我们获得的印象和体会是深刻的。我们两个国家的文化交流有悠久的历史，而两国人民在过去和现在为争取民族解放和创造和平幸福生活的斗争中更是息息相关。由这种战斗友谊联结起来的两国人民之间的关系和两国文化艺术的关系是亲密无间的。两国人民在每一方面都能互相了解，热烈共鸣！
    让我们感谢由刘仲卢团长领导的越南人民歌舞团的同志们为增进两国的友谊和文化交流所付出的辛劳和热情，让我们两国艺术家们真诚地互相学习罢。（附图片）
