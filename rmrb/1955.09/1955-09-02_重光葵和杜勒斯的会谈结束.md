Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 1st. - The three-day talks held in Washington between Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu葵 and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles concluded on August 31st, and a communique was issued.

The communique indicated that Shigemitsu葵 assured Dulles that Japan is determined to take U.S.-Japan cooperation "as the cornerstone of its foreign policy"; Japan will implement a policy of rearmament to serve the U.S.'s aggressive policy in the Far East.

The communique stated: The United States and Japan have agreed to "endeavor at all times" to create conditions so that Japan can "as quickly as possible" assume the primary responsibility for its "national defense" and can "contribute to international peace and security" in the Western Pacific.

During the talks, Shigemitsu葵 explained to the United States the Japanese government's arms expansion plan (this plan stipulates that by 1958, Japan will expand its army, navy, and air force to 200,000 men). Kyodo News reported that the United States expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's arms expansion plan. Therefore, the communique said that the two sides decided to hold "defense" negotiations in Tokyo in the future to continue studying Japan's plan and to review it at any time according to the United States' "strategic needs."

During the talks, the Japanese side raised the issue of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Japan, because the broad masses of the Japanese people are increasingly strongly opposed to the occupation by U.S. troops. However, the communique revealed that this issue can only be considered after the conditions are met for Japan to make contributions to further rearmament and to maintaining "international peace and security" in the Western Pacific.

In terms of economy, Shigemitsu葵 emphasized during the talks that Japan needs to expand trade with Asian countries and requested the United States to relax the "embargo" forcibly imposed on Japan against China. However, it can be seen from the communique that Dulles demanded that Japan rely on U.S. "assistance" and "foreign private investment" to "free countries" in Asia.

Regarding the outcome of this meeting, Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the right-wing Socialist Party, commented that the meeting did not bring anything beneficial to the Hatoyama government. Hiroo Wada, Secretary-General of the left-wing Socialist Party, accused the Hatoyama government of lacking an "independent spirit."

### 重光葵和杜勒斯的会谈结束

    重光葵和杜勒斯的会谈结束
    新华社一日讯　华盛顿消息：日本外务相重光葵和美国国务卿杜勒斯在华盛顿举行的三天会谈，已经在八月三十一日结束，并且发表了公报。
    公报表明，重光葵曾向杜勒斯保证，日本决心以美、日合作“作为它的外交政策的基石”；日本将要执行重整军备的政策，以便为美国在远东的侵略政策服务。
    公报说：美国和日本已经一致认为要“随时努力”创造条件，以便使日本能“尽可能迅速地”承担它的“本国防务”的主要责任，并且能对西太平洋的“国际和平和安全作出贡献”。
    在会谈中，重光葵向美国解释了日本政府的扩军计划（这个计划规定到一九五八年日本要把陆海空军扩充到二十万人）。共同社报道说，美国表示不满意日本的扩军计划。因此，公报说，双方决定今后在东京举行“防务”谈判，继续研究日本的计划，并且要根据美国的“战略需要”随时加以检查。
    日本方面在会谈中提出了修改美日“安全条约”和驻日美军撤退的问题，这是因为日本广大人民日益强烈地反对美军的占领。但是，公报透露，唯有在日本对进一步重整军备和对维持西太平洋的“国际和平和安全”作出贡献的条件具备之后，这个问题才可能被考虑。
    在经济方面，重光葵在会谈中曾强调日本需要同亚洲国家扩展贸易，并且要求美国放宽强使日本对中国实行的“禁运”。但是，从公报中可以看出，杜勒斯却要求日本依赖美国对亚洲“自由国家”的“援助”和“外国私人投资”。
    对于这次会谈的结果，右派社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎评论说：会谈并没有给鸠山政府带来任何有利的东西。左派社会党总书记和田博雄指责鸠山政府缺乏“独立的精神”。
