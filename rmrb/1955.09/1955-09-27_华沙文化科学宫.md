    The Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw

    In the heart of Warsaw, at the confluence of a dozen streets, stands a magnificent building that soars into the sky. People can see its top from all directions near Warsaw. This is the famous Stalin Palace of Culture and Science. Every night, dozens of huge searchlights project various magnificent lights onto this skyscraper, illuminating the entire building like a transparent and bright crystal palace.
    The Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science is the tallest building in Poland. Including the top, it has forty-three floors, reaching a height of 227 meters and a volume of 817,500 cubic meters. The newly paved ring road around it is five kilometers long. Along the inside of the ring road is a green area of 93,000 square meters with trees, flowers, and plants. More than 2,000 exotic flowers and trees from all over Poland are planted here, including 8,000 roses alone.
    The Palace of Culture and Science itself includes six main parts: the main building, four wings, and an auditorium, with nearly 3,000 rooms, living rooms, lecture halls, and conference rooms. The top part of the Palace of Culture and Science is occupied by the Polish Academy of Sciences and various scientific institutions, and there is also a national experimental television center. In the side wings, there are a youth palace, swimming pool, gymnasium, and boxing room, as well as a museum, three theaters, two cinemas, a concert hall, and a winter garden. This garden is located indoors on two floors, with a glass roof. Various flowers and trees collected from all over the world are planted inside. There are also three aquariums in the garden, displaying various exotic aquatic animals.
    A separate part of the Palace of Culture and Science is a large-scale and modern auditorium. It is 70 meters long, more than 50 meters wide, and 22 meters high. The white marble walls, red velvet seats, and crystal chandeliers hanging in the air reflect each other, forming a beautiful picture. There are approximately 3,500 seats, each equipped with earphones that can translate eight languages. The stage can be used for large-scale performances. If it is necessary to hold a meeting here, the stage can be converted into a suitable conference rostrum within two or three minutes at the touch of a button. Due to the perfect and ingenious design, even those sitting in the last row of the auditorium can clearly hear the sound from the stage.
    The entire Palace of Culture and Science is so vast, but internal transportation is very convenient. There are 34 elevators in various parts of the building, the fastest of which can carry people from the ground to the roof in 55 seconds.
    This Palace of Culture and Science is a precious gift from the Soviet people to the Polish people. It was proposed by Comrade Stalin and built according to the agreement signed by the Soviet and Polish governments in April 1952. On July 21, 1952, Soviet and Polish builders began pouring the first batch of concrete on the foundation of this building. Due to the mechanization of construction work, it was completed in full for the eleventh anniversary of the founding of People's Poland this July.
    The construction work of this Palace of Culture and Science was attended by 4,000 Soviet architects, engineers, and workers, as well as many Polish architects, engineers, and workers. To supply the various building materials needed for the Palace of Culture and Science, nearly 200 Soviet factories and 100 Polish factories put in their efforts. The murals in the palace hall are inlaid with marble from the Urals and Polish marble. The large chandeliers hanging in the hall are products carefully made by two factories in Kharkov and Riga in the Soviet Union for a year.
    The Stalin Palace of Culture and Science has now become the center of cultural activities in Warsaw. It is a workplace for Polish scientists, a school for young people to acquire knowledge, and a playground for recreation. Tens of thousands of people come here in a continuous stream, either participating in various activities or lingering near the Palace of Culture and Science, admiring its beautiful architectural style and majestic atmosphere. In August of this year, the Palace of Culture and Science received youths from all over the world. They gathered here to discuss many important issues, performed rich and colorful literary and artistic programs, and held various sports competitions.

    华沙文化科学宫
    在华沙市中心十几条大街的汇合处，矗立着一座耸入云霄的宏伟壮丽的建筑物。人们从华沙附近的各个方面都能望得到它的顶端。这就是闻名的斯大林文化科学宫。每当夜晚，数十架巨大的探照灯把各种瑰丽的光彩投射到这座摩天大楼上，把整个建筑物照耀得如同一座透明晶亮的水晶宫。
    华沙文化科学宫是波兰全国最高大的建筑物，连同顶部共有四十三层，高达二百二十七公尺，体积为八十一万七千五百立方公尺。周围新铺的环形大道有五公里长。沿着环形大道的内侧是面积九万三千平方公尺的林木花草等绿化区。这里栽种了两千多株从波兰各地运来的奇花异木，其中单是玫瑰花就有八千株。
    文化科学宫本身包括主楼、四翼和礼堂等六个主要部分，共有近三千间房间、客厅、讲堂和会议室。文化科学宫最上面的一部分由波兰科学院和各个科学机构所占用，这里还设有一个波兰全国的实验电视中心。在侧翼有青年宫、游泳池、体育馆和拳击室，还有一个博物馆、三个剧院、两座电影院、一个音乐厅和一座冬季花园。这座花园是设在两层楼高的室内的，上面是玻璃屋顶，室内栽种着从世界各地采集来的各种花木。园内还有三个水族馆，里边陈列着各种奇异的水生动物。
    文化科学宫的一个单独部分是一座规模宏大、设备新颖的礼堂。它有七十公尺长，五十多公尺宽，高达二十二公尺。白色的大理石墙壁、红色天鹅绒的座椅和悬在空中的水晶大吊灯，相互辉映，构成了一幅美丽的图景。这里共设有约三千五百个座位，每一个座位上都装置着能听八种语言的译意风耳机。这里的舞台可以供给大规模的演出应用。如果需要在这里举行会议的话，只要一按电钮，就能够在二、三分钟内把舞台改装成为一个合适的会议主席台。由于设计的完善巧妙，即使坐在礼堂的最后一排，也能清晰地听到从台上传来的声音。
    整个文化科学宫是如此庞大，但是内部的交通却是十分方便的。大厦各部分共有三十四架电梯，其中最快的能在五十五秒钟内把人们从地面载升到屋顶。
    这座文化科学宫是苏联人民赠送给波兰人民的珍贵礼物。它是由斯大林同志提议并根据一九五二年四月波苏两国政府签订的协定建造的。一九五二年七月二十一日，苏联和波兰的建设者们在这座大厦的地基上才开始浇灌第一批混凝土，由于建筑工作的机械化，到今年七月人民波兰立国十一周年时就全部完工了。
    参加这座文化科学宫的建设工作的，有四千名苏联建筑师、工程师和工人，还有许多波兰建筑师、工程师和工人。为了供应文化科学宫所需的各项建筑材料，差不多有二百个苏联工厂和一百个波兰工厂投进了它们的力量。宫内大厅的壁画是用来自乌拉尔的大理石和波兰大理石镶嵌成的。而悬挂在厅内的那些大吊灯，则是苏联哈尔科夫和里加的两个工厂用了一年的时间精制成功的产品。
    斯大林文化科学宫现在已经成为华沙的文化活动的中心。这里是波兰科学家的工作场所，是青年们吸取知识的学校和游玩的乐园。成千成万的人们川流不息地来到这里，他们或是参加各种活动，或是留恋忘返地在文化科学宫近旁散步漫游，赞赏它的美丽的建筑风格和雄伟的气魄。今年八月间，文化科学宫曾接待了来自世界各国的青年们。他们在这里集会讨论了许多重大的问题，演出了丰富多采的文艺节目，举行了各项运动比赛。
    华沙文化科学宫，它是苏波两国人民永恒的兄弟般的友谊的象征，它是波兰文化的一朵光芒四射的瑰丽的鲜花。（附图片）
