Relevant units in Heilongjiang Province actively support volunteer reclamation teams.

When the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team passed through Harbin, Yu Jie, the Deputy Governor of Heilongjiang Province, met with all the members of the reclamation team, expressing a warm welcome and support for their work. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League also held a forum for them. At the meeting, the person in charge of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League reported on the preparations for land reclamation. He told all the team members that the person in charge of the Provincial People's Committee had also participated in this preparatory work, and had selected the best one among the five major wilderness areas in Heilongjiang Province—the Fengxiang area within Luobei County—for the Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team. This area has convenient transportation, a mild climate, a short frost period, and fertile land, with a reclaimable land area of 50,000 to 60,000 hectares.

In order to enable the reclamation team to start reclaiming land as soon as possible, the Heilongjiang Provincial Land Survey Bureau sent a survey team to Luobei. It has now surveyed 20,000 hectares of wasteland, and the draft land planning map has been completed. The staff of the Provincial Communist Youth League's land reclamation preparation team purchased all the means of production for the reclamation team, including thirty-five horses, two rubber-tired carts, and other agricultural tools, which have now been transported to the site. The Provincial Grain Bureau is responsible for contacting cities and counties to allocate and supply food for people and feed for horses through the municipal and county grain departments. The youths of Hegang City and Luobei County prepared a lot of wood for the reclamation team to build houses, and the youths of Baoquanling Farm built four temporary houses for the reclamation team. All the houses can be built by mid-September. All the furniture such as pots, bowls, ladles, basins, and tanks were purchased and donated by the youths of eight units in Hegang City with the bonuses from over-fulfilling production tasks and the income from voluntary labor. After hearing the news that the reclamation team was coming, the youths in Jiamusi City actively prepared winter leather hats and leather boots for the sixty members of the reclamation team. In terms of technical guidance, in order to enable the young reclamation team in Beijing to quickly master agricultural production technology in Heilongjiang Province, the Hejiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League decided to send ten youths with skilled agricultural production technology from Huachuan County to help reclaim land. Baoquanling Farm also sent a technician to guide the reclamation. It is now preliminarily determined that 300 hectares of land will be reclaimed this year.

The care and help of the Party, the government, and the youth have inspired all the members of the reclamation team. They expressed that they would overcome all difficulties and complete the task of land reclamation. (Our reporter stationed in Harbin)

    黑龙江有关单位积极支援志愿垦荒队
    北京市青年志愿垦荒队路过哈尔滨时，黑龙江省副省长于杰接见了垦荒队的全体人员，对他们的工作表示热烈欢迎和支持。青年团黑龙江省委员会并为他们召开了一次座谈会，会上团省委农村工作部负责人报告了关于开荒的准备工作情况，他告诉全体队员们：省人民委员会负责人也参加了这项筹备工作，为青年志愿垦荒队选择了黑龙江省五大荒区之中最好的一个——萝北县境内的凤翔地区。这个地区交通方便、气候温和、有霜期短、土地肥沃，可开荒地面积达五万至六万公顷。
    为使垦荒队早日开荒，黑龙江省土地勘测局派一个勘测小组到萝北去，现已勘测出荒地两万公顷，土地规划草案图已完成。省团委开荒筹备工作人员为开荒队买了全部生产资料，有三十五匹马、两台胶轮车以及其他农具，现已运到现场。人吃的粮食和马的饲料由省粮食局负责同市、县联系，由市县粮食部门调拨供应。鹤岗市和萝北县的青年，为垦荒队准备了盖房用的很多木料，宝泉岭农场青年为垦荒队搭了四间临时住房，全部住房九月中旬可以盖好。锅、碗、瓢、盆、缸等全部家具，都是鹤岗市八个单位的青年用超额完成生产任务的奖金和义务劳动的收入来购赠的。佳木斯市的青年听到垦荒队要到的消息后，就积极为这六十名垦荒队员准备冬季用的皮帽和皮靰鞡。在技术指导方面，为了使北京市的青年垦荒队很快地掌握黑龙江省的农业生产技术，青年团合江地委决定由桦川县派十名熟练农业生产技术的青年帮助开荒。宝泉岭农场也派了一名技术员前去指导开荒。现在初步确定计划今年开荒三百公顷。
    党、政府和青年们的关怀和帮助，鼓舞了垦荒队的全体人员，他们表示要克服一切困难，完成开荒任务。　（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
