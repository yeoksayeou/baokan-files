    Automatic Combined Machine for Radiator Fins Developed
    Chen Xiulin, a youth worker at the state-owned Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory and a Shanghai Municipal Industrial Labor Model, successfully created an automatic combined machine for radiator fins, greatly increasing production efficiency. On September 1st, this machine was officially put into production, and within five days, it had completed the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory's entire September production task for radiator fins, with all products meeting quality standards.
    Radiator fins are the main parts for manufacturing diesel engine radiators. In the past, processing this part required four processes, which not only had low production efficiency but also often caused industrial accidents. Chen Xiulin began designing this machine at the end of 1954. With the help of workers in the machine shop and tool shop, he finally succeeded in creating the automatic combined machine for radiator fins in August of this year. This machine allows the four processes to be carried out together, and everything from feeding the materials to producing the finished product is automated. According to the measurement by the rationalization proposal committee of this factory, after the full effectiveness of this machine is brought into play, one person operating it can equal the efficiency of two hundred people manufacturing radiator fins by hand, and it can complete the factory's entire month's production task for radiator fins in just over a day.
    Chen Xiulin is a young lathe operator who has just turned twenty-one. Since entering the factory in August 1953, he has created and improved eighteen tools and operating methods. On September 10th, at the Shanghai Municipal Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, he stated that during the first Five-Year Plan period, he would create another automatic machine to automate the water pipe interface work of diesel engine radiators. He has now begun research on this automatic machine.

    水箱散热片自动联合机制成
    上海市工业劳动模范、国营上海柴油机厂青年工人陈修林，创造水箱散热片自动联合机成功，使生产效率大大提高。九月一日这部机器正式投入生产，五天内就全部完成了上海柴油机厂九月份的水箱散热片的生产任务，产品质量完全合格。
    水箱散热片是制造柴油机水箱的主要零件。过去加工这个零件需要经过四道工序，不但生产效率低，而且时常发生工伤事故。陈修林从一九五四年底开始设计这种机器。在机工车间、工具车间职工们的帮助下，他终于在今年八月间创造成功了水箱散热片自动联合机。这部机器使四道工序能连在一起做，从放进材料到制出成品全部自动化。根据这个厂的合理化建议委员会的测定，这部机器的效力充分发挥以后，一个人操作能够抵上二百个人用手工制造水箱散热片的效率，只用一天多的时间就可以完成现在全厂一个月的水箱散热片的生产任务。
    陈修林是个刚满二十一岁的青年车工。从一九五三年八月进厂，到现在他已经创造和改进了十八种工具和操作方法。九月十日，他在上海市青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上，表示要在第一个五年计划期间，再创造一部自动机器，使柴油机水箱水管接口工作自动化。现在，他已经开始了这种自动化机器的研究。
