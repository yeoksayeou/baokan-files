The Vietnam News Agency recently published a letter from Pham Van Dong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference—Eden and Molotov—on August 17. On September 9, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, was also instructed to submit a memorandum to Desai, Chairman of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission. The aforementioned letter and memorandum detail the current situation in Vietnam and point out that the implementation of the Geneva Accords is facing serious threats.

The central issue in implementing the Geneva Accords in Vietnam is that the responsible authorities in the North and South should, in accordance with the agreement, hold a consultation conference on July 20, 1955, to prepare for the reunification of Vietnam through free general elections in July 1956. The completion of the concentration and transfer of military forces by the French and Vietnamese parties has created the necessary preconditions for the resolution of Vietnam's political issues. The situation in Vietnam has every reason and possibility to develop normally in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords. However, the southern authorities in Vietnam are pursuing policies that violate the Geneva Accords. The solemn international agreement is being openly undermined by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. This situation cannot but cause serious anxiety among the people of Asia and peace-loving people all over the world.

The seriousness of the situation in Vietnam lies first and foremost in the fact that the southern authorities in Vietnam have adopted a fundamentally negative attitude towards fulfilling the unavoidable responsibility of implementing the Geneva Accords. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique brazenly claims that it did not sign the Geneva Accords and is therefore not bound by any of its provisions. Under this pretext, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique unreasonably rejected the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to send representatives to hold consultations on schedule in order to obstruct the reunification of Vietnam. This excuse of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, which disregards solemn international agreements, is extremely absurd, because Article 27 of the Ceasefire Agreement clearly stipulates: "The signatories of this document and their successors in office shall be responsible for observing and implementing all the terms and provisions of this Agreement." Since the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is the successor to the French government that signed the Ceasefire Agreement, what reason does it have to evade its responsibility to implement the Geneva Accords? If the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is allowed to arbitrarily negate solemn international agreements, the entire foundation of the Geneva Accords will be subjected to unimaginable destruction, and the entire situation in Southeast Asia will inevitably be seriously affected. This is absolutely unacceptable to the people of Asia.

The seriousness of the situation in Vietnam also lies in the fact that the southern authorities in Vietnam are brutally trampling on the various provisions of the Geneva Accords. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in violation of the agreement, has adopted extremely cruel retaliatory measures against former resistance personnel in South Vietnam. At the same time, it has carried out barbaric massacres of people and people from all walks of life in South Vietnam, regardless of gender or age, who advocate consultation and elections to seek reunification. According to incomplete statistics, since the ceasefire a year ago, a total of 1,202 people have been killed, 4,231 have been injured, 25,165 have been arrested, and 705 have disappeared in South Vietnam. These heinous atrocities have aroused the greatest indignation of all people who uphold justice and love peace. They are a blatant violation of Articles 8 and 9 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and Article 14 (c) of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement.

While vigorously suppressing the people and opposing the reunification of Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is doing its utmost to lean on the United States, exclude dissidents, rely on American supplies, actively strengthen its military forces, create a war atmosphere, and advocate preparing to "march north." Warplanes and various war materials are continuously being transported into South Vietnam, and American military personnel are entering Saigon and other places in batches. Military airfields in various locations are being expanded or rushed to completion. In order to split Vietnam and establish its dictatorial rule, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has in fact placed South Vietnam under the military control of the United States. The so-called US military delegation stationed in South Vietnam is essentially the general headquarters of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army. American military personnel have been assigned to every unit of the Ngo Dinh Diem army. It is no longer the Ngo Dinh Diem clique that controls all the activities of the South Vietnamese army, but the so-called US military delegation. All this not only violates Articles 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference and Articles 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the Ceasefire Agreement, but also seriously threatens the security of Southeast Asia.

In addition, it should also be pointed out that in order to facilitate its unbridled pursuit of these destructive activities, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has not only failed to fulfill the provisions of Article 25 of the agreement, giving the International Commission all possible protection, assistance and cooperation, but has also carried out intolerable sabotage, destruction and personal attacks against this international impartial organization and its staff.

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique dares to adopt such an arrogant attitude towards the Geneva Accords entirely because it has received open encouragement and protection from the United States. On June 28, US Secretary of State Dulles said that the general election in Vietnam could only be held under so-called "genuinely free conditions." Shortly thereafter, Ngo Dinh Diem followed suit, falsely claiming that he doubted whether the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "has the conditions to realize free voting," creating an excuse to refuse to negotiate. When Ngo Dinh Diem publicly stated his refusal to negotiate, Dulles immediately declared: "The United States supports the position taken by Ngo Dinh Diem, the Prime Minister of free Vietnam." All of the aforementioned US military activities to control South Vietnam are undoubtedly the main factors that embolden Ngo Dinh Diem to attack the International Commission, refuse to negotiate, and massacre the people, clamoring for "marching north." This approach of the United States can only be understood as an attempt by the United States to permanently split Vietnam, obstruct the reunification of Vietnam, and turn southern Vietnam into a US military base.

The various provisions of the Geneva Accords constitute an organic whole. Only after all these provisions are fully implemented, and only after Vietnam is unified on the basis of respecting Vietnam's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, can peace in Indochina be effectively guaranteed. It is on the basis of this understanding that the Chinese people believe that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's refusal to negotiate, obstruction of general elections, and terrorist acts in South Vietnam, with the support and assistance of the United States, must be stopped, and the phenomenon of certain major powers disregarding the Geneva Accords and evading their international obligations must be quickly corrected. We fully support the suggestions made by Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong in his letter to Eden and Molotov, that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference should take all necessary measures to ensure respect for the Geneva Accords and immediately convene a consultation conference between the responsible authorities in the North and South to resolve the political problems of Vietnam. This is not only to satisfy the desire of the entire Vietnamese people for peace, reunification and independence, but also for the sake of peace and security in Asia.

### 日内瓦协议一定要全部实施

    日内瓦协议一定要全部实施
    越南通讯社最近公布了越南民主共和国外交部长范文同八月十七日给日内瓦会议两位主席——艾登和莫洛托夫——的信件。九月九日，越南人民军总司令武元甲将军又奉命向国际监督和监察委员会主席德赛提出备忘录。上述的信件和备忘录，都详尽地说明了越南目前的局势，并指出日内瓦协议的实施，正受到严重的威胁。
    目前在越南贯彻日内瓦协议的中心问题，是南北负责当局应该按照协议，在一九五五年七月二十日举行协商会议，准备在一九五六年七月用自由普选的办法，实现越南的统一。法、越双方军事部队集结和转移工作的完成，已为越南政治问题的解决创造了必要的前提。越南的局势，完全有理由也完全有可能按照日内瓦协议的精神，获得正常的发展。但是，越南南部当局却奉行违反日内瓦协议的政策。庄严的国际协定，正遭受到吴庭艳集团的公然破坏。这种情况，不能不引起亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人士的严重不安。
    越南局势的严重性，首先在于越南南部当局对于履行日内瓦协议的无可规避的责任，采取了根本否定的态度。吴庭艳集团放肆地声称，它没有在日内瓦协议上签字，因而不受日内瓦协议的任何约束。在这种借口之下，吴庭艳集团无理地拒绝了越南民主共和国关于互派代表按期举行协商会议的建议，以便阻挠越南的统一。吴庭艳集团这种蔑视庄严的国际协定的借口，是极端荒谬的，因为停战协定第二十七条明确规定：“本文件签署人及其职务的继承人均应负责遵守并实施本协定的各项条款和规定。”吴庭艳集团既然是签署停战协定的法国政府的继承者，那末，它有什么理由来规避自己履行日内瓦协议的责任呢？如果允许吴庭艳集团随意否定庄严的国际协定，日内瓦协议的整个基础，就将会受到不堪设想的破坏，整个东南亚的局势也必然要受到严重的影响。这是亚洲人民绝对不能容许的。
    越南局势的严重性，还在于越南南方当局对日内瓦协议的各项条款，加以粗暴的蹂躏。吴庭艳集团违反协议，对在南越的前抗战人员采取了极端残酷的报复手段，同时，它对南越一切主张协商选举谋求统一的人民和各界人士进行了不分男女老幼的野蛮屠杀。据不完全统计，自从停战起的一年来，越南南方人民被杀死的共有一千二百零二人，被打伤四千二百三十一人，被捕二万五千一百六十五人，失踪七百零五人。这些令人发指的暴行，激起了一切主张正义、爱好和平的人士的最大愤怒，它们是对日内瓦会议最后宣言第八条、第九条，越南停战协定第十四条丙款的公然破坏。
    吴庭艳集团一面厉行镇压人民，反对谋求越南统一；另一方面，它又竭力投靠美国，排斥异己，倚靠美国的供应，积极加强自己的军事力量，制造战争气氛，鼓吹准备“北进”。作战飞机和各种战争物资正源源不断地运进南越，美国军事人员成批地进入西贡等地，各处的军用机场正在扩建或加紧修建。吴庭艳集团为了分裂越南，建立它的独裁统治，实际上已经把南越置于美国的军事控制之下。美国驻南越的所谓军事代表团，俨然就是吴庭艳集团军队的总司令部。美国军事人员被分配到吴庭艳军队的每个单位里去。掌握南越军队的全部活动的早已不是吴庭艳集团，而是美国的所谓军事代表团。所有这一切不仅违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言第四和第五条，违反了停战协定第十六条、第十七条、第十八条和第十九条，而且严重地威胁着东南亚的安全。
    另外，还应该指出，为了便于它放手进行这些破坏活动，吴庭艳集团不仅没有履行协定第二十五条的规定，给予国际委员会以一切可能的保护、协助和合作，而且对这一国际公正组织及其工作人员，进行不能容忍的捣毁、破坏和人身攻击。
    吴庭艳集团对于日内瓦协议胆敢采取如此嚣张的态度，完全是因为它得到了美国方面的公开鼓励和庇护。六月二十八日，美国国务卿杜勒斯说越南的普选只能在所谓“真正自由的条件下举行”。过后不久，吴庭艳就依样画葫芦，妄称他怀疑越南民主共和国“是否具有实现自由投票的条件”，为拒绝进行协商制造借口。当吴庭艳公开表示拒绝进行协商后，杜勒斯又立即声明：“美国支持自由越南总理吴庭艳所持的立场。”所有上述美国控制南越的军事活动毫无疑问地是吴庭艳敢于攻击国际委员会，敢于拒绝协商并敢于屠杀人民、叫嚣“北进”的主要因素。美国这种作法，只能理解为美国力图永远分裂越南，阻挠越南的统一，并把越南南部变为美国的军事基地。
    日内瓦协议的各项条款，构成了一个有机的整体。只有在这些条款都全部实施之后，只有在尊重越南的主权、独立和领土完整的基础上统一了越南之后，才能有效地保证印度支那的和平。正是基于这样的理解，中国人民认为，吴庭艳集团在美国支持和协助之下，拒绝协商、阻挠普选以及在南越进行的恐怖行为，必须加以制止，某些大国藐视日内瓦协议、规避自己所承担的国际义务的现象，必须迅速纠正。我们完全支持范文同外交部长致艾登和莫洛托夫信中所提出的建议，即要求日内瓦会议的两位主席，采取一切必要的措施，以保证尊重日内瓦协议，立即召开南北负责当局的协商会议，解决越南的政治问题。这不仅是为了满足越南全体人民要求和平、统一和独立的愿望，同时也是为了亚洲和平和安全的利益。
