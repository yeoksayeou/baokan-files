Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 6th: On the morning of September 5th, large numbers of French police conducted extensive searches of North African residences throughout France and arrested large numbers of North Africans. The French authorities accused them of supporting the North African national liberation movement.

According to Agence France-Presse, more than one hundred North Africans were arrested in Paris. In Marseille, police questioned more than three thousand people and arrested more than three hundred. In Lyon, two hundred people were arrested. Many North Africans were also arrested in many towns in the Seine-et-Oise department.

On the same day, French troops continued to search the Oudjaim region of central Morocco for the Smala tribesmen who refused to surrender.

The situation in Morocco remains the focus of attention for French politicians. The Paris newspaper "Combat" pointed out that French politicians continue to argue over such issues as the abolition of the current Moroccan Sultan Arafa, the composition of the "Council of the Throne" and the Moroccan government, and the conditions and date for the transfer of former Sultan Yusuf from his exile in Madagascar to France.

French representative General Catroux, who was sent to negotiate with former Moroccan Sultan Yusuf on the situation in Morocco, arrived in Madagascar on the 5th. A delegation of Moroccan politicians also arrived in Madagascar for this purpose.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 7th: Of the Algerians illegally arrested in various parts of France on September 5th, more than two hundred and twenty have been transported by French authorities by plane from France to Algeria for trial. At the same time, France continues to reinforce its troops in Algeria, and more than a thousand French troops have now arrived in Aran, Algeria. France has also borrowed eight American helicopters to scout and track the Algerian people's armed forces.

On the other hand, the Algerian People's Armed Forces also continue to operate in Constantine Province, constantly attacking French military strongholds and destroying the communication equipment of French colonists.

Algerian nationalists accuse the United States of supporting the French colonial army with military equipment. They say that all the French troops in North Africa, except for one legion, are equipped with American uniforms, weapons, and guns.

In Morocco, a nationalist organization called "Heroes of Independence" distributed leaflets on the 5th, calling on the Moroccan people to hold a general strike across the country on the 12th to pressure the pro-French current Sultan Arafa to abdicate. Alal al-Fassi, leader of the Moroccan nationalist party Istiqlal, said in Cairo on the 6th that he demanded the reinstatement of former Sultan Yusuf.
