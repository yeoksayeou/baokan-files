    A Careless Security Worker

    To the Editor:

    On August 26th, I was eating at a cold food shop in front of the Shenyang Railway Station when I suddenly noticed an unattended briefcase on the table in front of me. It was clear that it must contain many documents, and someone had carelessly lost it. As a revolutionary soldier, to prevent bad elements from stealing state secrets, I sat in the cold food shop, acting as a voluntary "guard" for the briefcase, waiting for the owner to return and claim it.

    Half an hour later, the owner returned in a panic, looking for the briefcase. After the shop assistant confirmed it, I returned the briefcase to him. It turned out that he was a staff member named Xia Shangrong from the Security Section of the Kangfu Hospital in Henan Province. He had come to Shenyang this time to investigate the political history of certain staff members, and the briefcase contained a large number of materials and many letters of introduction.

    Currently, a struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries is underway throughout the country. Xia Shangrong is a person doing security work, and this time he came to the Northeast with important responsibilities, but he did not even have the most basic revolutionary vigilance, losing a briefcase full of confidential documents! This is really unacceptable. I hope that the Party organization of the Kangfu Hospital in Henan Province will give Xia Shangrong the punishment he deserves and use this incident to educate all staff members to raise their revolutionary vigilance and do a good job in confidentiality.

    一个麻痹大意的保卫工作人员编辑同志：
    八月二十六日，我在沈阳车站前的一家冷食店吃东西，忽然发现我面前的桌子上放着一个没有主人的公事皮包。很显然，这里面一定装了很多文件，不知是那一个麻痹大意的人丢掉的。我是个革命军人，为了不使坏分子盗窃国家机密，我就一直坐在冷食店里，替这个皮包当义务“警卫员”，等待着失主回来认领。
    过了半小时，失主才惊慌失措地回来找皮包。经过售货员的证实，我把皮包还给了他。原来他是河南省康复医院保卫科的科员，名叫夏尚荣，这次到沈阳来调查某些工作人员的政治历史情况，皮包里装的就是大批材料和许多介绍信。
    目前全国各地正在进行肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，夏尚荣是一个做保卫工作的人员，这次到东北来又负有重要责任，可是他却连最起码的革命警惕性也没有，把装满机密文件的皮包丢失了！这实在太不应该了。希望河南省康复医院党组织给夏尚荣以应有的处分，并且用这件事教育全体工作人员提高革命警惕性，做好保密工作。
