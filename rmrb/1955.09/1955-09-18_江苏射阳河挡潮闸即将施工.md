    Jiangsu Sheyang River Tide Barrier to be Constructed Soon
    A tide barrier will soon be constructed at Daxuejian on the Sheyang River in the Lixiahe region of Jiangsu Province. This is one of the major projects in this year's Huai River Harnessing Project. The project headquarters has now been established. Rows of workers' dormitories have been built on the construction site. Workers are repairing roads and bridges, and laying narrow-gauge railways. Technicians are surveying and setting out on the construction site. Large quantities of grain, cement, steel bars, and other materials are being continuously transported to the construction site.
    Preparations for the construction of the Sheyang Barrier began in the winter of 1953. After detailed surveys and explorations, and with the help of Soviet experts, the technical design has now been completed. In the design, the engineering personnel studied and adopted the advanced Soviet experience of not driving foundation piles, which can save the state more than 3 million yuan in construction costs.
    The Lixiahe region of Jiangsu Province has more than 10 million mu of fertile land, 80 percent of which is planted with rice, and it is a land of fish and rice in the lower reaches of the Huai River. In the past, due to floods, waterlogging, and backflow of sea tides, harvests were not guaranteed. Since the harnessing of the Huai River, the threat of floods to the Lixiahe region has been reduced. After the Sheyang Barrier is completed, it can protect 14 million mu of land in the Lixiahe region and coastal reclamation areas from backflow of sea tides, and can also eliminate a certain degree of rainstorm disasters.

### 江苏射阳河挡潮闸即将施工

    江苏射阳河挡潮闸即将施工
    在江苏省里下河地区射阳河的大学尖，即将修建一座挡潮闸。这是今年治淮工程中的主要工程之一。现在工程指挥部已经成立。工地上已修建了一排排的工棚。工人们正在整修公路和桥梁，铺设轻便铁轨。技术员们正在工地上测量放样。大批的粮草和水泥、钢筋等器材，正源源运往工地。
    修建射阳闸的准备工作，从一九五三年冬就已开始。经过详细的勘查和钻探，和在苏联专家的帮助下，现在已完成技术设计。在设计中，工程人员学习并采用了苏联不打基桩的先进经验，可为国家节约工程费用三百多万元。
    江苏省里下河地区有一千多万亩良田，百分之八十种水稻，是淮河下游的鱼米之乡。过去由于受洪水、内涝和海潮倒灌，收成没有保证。治淮以来，已减轻了对里下河地区的洪水威胁。射阳闸修成后，可使里下河地区和海边垦区一千四百万亩土地免遭海潮倒灌，并可免除一定程度的暴雨灾害。
