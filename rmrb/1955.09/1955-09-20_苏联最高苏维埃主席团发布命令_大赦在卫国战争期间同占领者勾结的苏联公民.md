Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th. TASS, Moscow reports: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued an edict on the 17th regarding amnesty for Soviet citizens who collaborated with the occupiers during the Soviet Great Patriotic War.

The edict states: Following the victorious conclusion of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people have achieved many new and significant accomplishments in economic and cultural construction, and in further consolidating their socialist country in all aspects.

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, taking this into consideration, as well as the termination of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany, and in the spirit of humanitarian principles, believes that amnesty can be granted to those Soviet citizens who, during the Great Patriotic War, were tempted by cowardice or lack of awareness to collaborate with the occupiers.

In order to give these citizens the opportunity to return to an honest working life and become a useful member of socialist society, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has decided:

Those sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years for crimes such as serving the enemy during the Great Patriotic War shall be released; those sentenced to more than ten years shall have their sentences halved. Those convicted for serving in the German army, police, and German special forces shall be released unconditionally; those exiled and banished shall be exempted from continuing their sentences. Those who have committed the above crimes but have not yet been tried shall not be prosecuted.

Those convicted of murdering and torturing Soviet citizens shall not be pardoned.

Soviet citizens currently residing abroad who surrendered to the enemy during the Great Patriotic War or served in the German army, police stations, and German special forces shall be exempt from prosecution; Soviet citizens currently residing abroad who held leading positions in the police, gendarmerie, and propaganda organs established by the occupiers during the Great Patriotic War (including those who were induced to join anti-Soviet organizations after the war) shall be exempt from prosecution if they have atoned for their actions with consistent patriotic actions beneficial to the motherland or have already surrendered. Soviet citizens who have committed serious crimes against the Soviet state during the war according to current laws and are exiled abroad, if they return to surrender, may be treated leniently and sentenced to no more than five years of exile.

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR also instructs the Council of Ministers of the USSR to take measures to facilitate the return of Soviet citizens currently abroad and their families (regardless of nationality) to the Soviet Union and to assist them in finding employment in the Soviet Union.

    苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布命令
    大赦在卫国战争期间同占领者勾结的苏联公民
    新华社十八日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团十七日发布了关于大赦在苏联卫国战争期间同占领者进行勾结的苏联公民的命令。
    命令指出：在伟大的卫国战争胜利结束之后，苏联人民在经济、文化建设和进一步巩固自己社会主义国家的各方面已经取得了许多新的巨大成就。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团考虑到这一点以及苏联和德国之间战争状态的终止，并且本着人道主义的原则，认为对伟大的卫国战争期间由于胆小或者觉悟不高而被诱惑同占领者进行勾结的那些苏联公民可以实行大赦。
    为了给予这些公民以重新回到诚实的劳动生活和成为社会主义社会有用的一员的机会，苏联最高苏维埃主席团决定：
    凡卫国战争时期犯有为敌人服务等罪行而被判十年以下徒刑者予以释放；被判十年以上徒刑者减半执行。凡因为在德国军队、警察和德国特种部队中服务而被判罪者，一律释放；被流放和放逐者免除继续服刑。凡犯有上项罪行而尚未审判者，不予审理。
    凡因为杀害和严刑拷问苏联公民而定罪者不予赦免。
    凡卫国战争期间向敌人投降或为德国军队、警察局和德国特种部队服务的、现居国外的苏联公民免予追究；凡在卫国战争期间在占领者所建立的警察、宪兵和宣传机关担任领导职务（包括战后被诱加入反苏组织的人）的现居国外的苏联公民，如以一贯有利于祖国的爱国行动赎罪或已自首者，免予追究。按现行法律曾在战争中对苏维埃国家犯有严重罪行而流亡国外的苏联公民，如回来自首，可从轻处理，判刑不超过五年流放。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团并且责成苏联部长会议采取措施，便利目前在国外的苏联公民以及他们的家属（不分国籍）返回苏联，并且帮助他们在苏联就业。
