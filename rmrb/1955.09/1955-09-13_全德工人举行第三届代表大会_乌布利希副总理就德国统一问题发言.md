Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 11th: The Third All-German Workers' Congress was held in Leipzig on the 9th. Present were 4,200 representatives of workers from East and West Germany.

    Free German Trade Union Federation Secretary Kirchner delivered a report at the meeting. In his report, he suggested that the Free German Trade Union Federation and the West German Trade Union Federation put forward common opinions on the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in October. He then explained the Free German Trade Union Federation's views on the issue of restoring German unity and called for all-German understanding on a broad basis.

    German Democratic Republic Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht spoke during the discussion. He said: In order to achieve German unification, the interests of both East and West Germany must be taken into account. He emphasized that the preconditions for reunification can only be created on the basis of equal rights. Both sides must recognize that reunification is only possible on the condition of guaranteeing peace in Europe and preventing Germany from becoming a militaristic country and a war base for the North Atlantic bloc.

    The congress unanimously adopted a resolution calling on all German workers to strive for the unity of the working class.

    The resolution pointed out that the struggle against the resurgence of West German militarism and for peace and the establishment of a unified, democratic Germany requires trade union workers in the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic to jointly discuss measures for cooperation and unified struggle. The resolution calls on West German trade union workers to organize mutual visits of workers and trade union delegations.

    The resolution calls on the West German government to restore normal relations with the government of the German Democratic Republic in order to bring East and West Germany closer together.
