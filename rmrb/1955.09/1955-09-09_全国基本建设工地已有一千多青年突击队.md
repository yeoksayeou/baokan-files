　　Over One Thousand Youth Shock Brigades on National Basic Construction Sites

Recently, youth shock brigades on various basic construction sites across the country have greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, there are now 1,551 youth shock brigades nationwide, with 30,825 members.

These youth shock brigades are constantly breaking labor quotas and creating new achievements in production. More than 140 youth shock brigades in Beijing have overfulfilled their second-quarter project plans. The Yu Chunhe bricklaying youth shock brigade overfulfilled the first half of the year's state plan by 76.26%. After studying the country's First Five-Year Plan, they proposed to overfulfill the second half of this year's construction tasks by 89% on the premise of ensuring project quality, and to reduce the material consumption rate from the state-stipulated 2% to 0.5%. Since being named in May, the Sun Jialiu carpentry youth shock brigade of the Northwest Second Construction Company has created four advanced production tools: the "crescent-shaped paper-cutting double-knife single-edged knife," the "plum blossom chisel," the "batten frame," and the "mobile scaffolding," and has overfulfilled seven major engineering tasks by an average of 71.54%.

Many youth shock brigades take the lead in responding to the Party's call to practice strict economy and oppose waste, implement strict economy in production, and minimize the consumption of building materials. The Zhang Baifa rebar youth shock brigade in Beijing saved more than 3,800 kilograms of rebar in the second quarter while overfulfilling the task by an average of 34.73%. The Qianjin youth shock brigade of the Fourth Engineering Office of the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering learned the experience of civilized construction and basically eliminated the loss of red bricks and mortar, saving more than 10,000 red bricks in one task alone. The Wang Junqi youth shock brigade of the First Engineering Company of the Hebei Textile Administration Bureau put forward the slogan "Do not waste half a brick, do not drop a drop of ash," and implemented the "cost-saving accounting," "regional responsibility," and "mutual inspection" systems, saving the state construction materials such as blue bricks, cement, lime, and coarse sand worth 5,312 yuan in the second quarter.

    全国基本建设工地已有一千多青年突击队
    全国各基本建设工地上的青年突击队近来有很大的发展。据不完全统计，全国现在已经有一千五百五十一个青年突击队，队员三万零八百二十五人。
    这些青年突击队，在生产上不断突破劳动定额，创造新的成绩。北京市有一百四十多个青年突击队都超额完成了第二季度的工程计划。于春和瓦工青年突击队，超额百分之七十六点二六完成了上半年国家计划。他们学习了国家的第一个五年计划以后，又提出要在确保工程质量的前提下，超额百分之八十九完成今年下半年的工程任务，并把材料耗损率由国家规定的百分之二降低到千分之五。西北第二建筑公司孙家骝木工青年突击队，自五月命名以来，创造了“月牙形裁纸双刀单刃刀”“梅花凿子”“板条架”“活动脚手架”四种先进生产工具，平均超额百分之七十一点五四完成了七项较大的工程任务。
    许多青年突击队带头响应党的厉行节约、反对浪费的号召，在生产中实行严格的节约，尽量减少建筑材料的耗费。北京张百发钢筋工青年突击队，第二季度在平均超额百分之三十四点七三完成任务的同时，节约了三千八百多公斤钢筋。建筑工程部东北第一工程公司第四工程处前进青年突击队，学习了文明施工的经验，基本上消灭了红砖和灰浆的损耗，仅在一项任务中就节省了一万多块红砖。河北纺织管理局第一工程公司王俊起青年突击队提出“不浪费半块砖、不掉一滴灰”的行动口号，并推行了“节约核算”“区域责任”“相互检查”等制度，第二季度就给国家节约了价值五千三百十二元的青砖、水泥、白灰、粗砂等建筑材料。（新华社）
