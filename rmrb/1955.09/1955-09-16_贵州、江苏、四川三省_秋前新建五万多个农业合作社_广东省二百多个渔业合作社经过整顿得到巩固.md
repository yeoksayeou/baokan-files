　　This newspaper reports that Guizhou, Jiangsu, Sichuan and other provinces have established a large number of agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest.

　　From the beginning of July to the beginning of September, Guizhou Province newly established more than 24,000 agricultural production cooperatives, and agricultural production cooperatives in ethnic minority areas have also greatly developed. According to statistics from six special districts, 4,497 ethnic minority agricultural production cooperatives and ethnic joint cooperatives have been established. Before July this year, there were 6,400 agricultural production cooperatives in the province. Together with the newly established cooperatives, there are now more than 30,000, basically achieving the goal of having cooperatives in every township, and some villages have become cooperativized. In order to adapt to the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives in the future, Guizhou Province plans to train 100,000 active peasant elements by the end of this year. At present, according to incomplete statistics from various places, more than 43,000 key members for establishing cooperatives have been trained in batches.

　　As of now, Jiangsu Province has newly established 20,000 agricultural production cooperatives, reaching 30.9 percent of the development plan. This year, various places have had bumper harvests of early and mid-season rice and other autumn crops, and farmers are actively requesting to establish cooperatives before the autumn planting. 140,000 mutual aid teams have applied to establish cooperatives. According to the requirements of the masses, the Siyang County Party Committee has approved the establishment of 873 new cooperatives with 18,395 peasant households joining; 445 old cooperatives have also been expanded. Now, there are more than 2,300 cooperatives in the county, including old cooperatives, with 46.8 percent of the total peasant households in the county participating in the cooperatives, and 66 cooperativized townships have already been established. By the end of August, Suqian County had built 1,490 new cooperatives, with 34,486 peasant households participating. Including the expansion of the old cooperatives, the peasant households participating in the cooperatives accounted for 48.7 percent of the total peasant households in the county, and the development plan for agricultural production cooperatives in the county this winter and next spring has been completed. In Tai County, where development was slow in the past, 835 new cooperatives were built or are being built in August.

　　In Sichuan Province, more than 390,000 peasant households have joined cooperatives before this autumn harvest. In the six special districts of Wenjiang, Neijiang, Jiangjin, Suining, Luzhou, and Leshan alone, more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives were newly established before the autumn harvest. Around the autumn harvest this year, a cooperative upsurge has appeared in some areas of Sichuan Province. In particular, the clear fact that the original more than 28,000 cooperatives increased production and increased income has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to join cooperatives. After seeing that the old cooperatives generally increased production by 20 to 30 percent in the spring harvest, more than 17,000 peasant households in Jianyang County are busy applying to join the cooperatives. After the autumn harvest distribution, 3,255 mutual aid teams in Renshou County were transformed from teams into cooperatives. Now, the newly built cooperatives in various places are intensively carrying out autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting activities.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th. Over 200 fishery production cooperatives in Guangdong Province have been consolidated after rectification since the first half of this year. Many cooperatives have adjusted phenomena such as excessively low tool depreciation rates and excessively long depreciation fee repayment periods. Now, most of the deep-sea operation cooperatives in the province have implemented a production responsibility system of "contracting production, contracting management, and contracting repairs," and have formulated production plans on a quarterly and monthly basis. In the fishery production cooperatives in the East Guangdong District and Hainan Island, nearly 70 percent of the cooperatives have also implemented a reward system for over-quota production after setting production quotas.

　　Since June, fishery production has entered the off-season. During this period, most production cooperatives have adopted two to three types of operations based on local sea currents, climate, and fishing seasons in order to strive for a non-slack off-season. Those who have always operated trawling also engage in fishing and surrounding net operations; shallow water operations are also developing towards deep water operations. The First Production Cooperative of Lingshui County, Hainan Island, has adopted seven types of operations, trawling when there is wind, setting surrounding nets when the sea is calm, and pulling large nets in the port when there is a strong wind. As a result, they catch fish every day, completely eliminating the off-season, and production in the first half of this year increased by 76.6 percent compared with the same period last year.

    贵州、江苏、四川三省
    秋前新建五万多个农业合作社
    广东省二百多个渔业合作社经过整顿得到巩固
    本报讯　贵州、江苏、四川等省秋前新建立了大批农业生产合作社。
    从七月初到九月初，贵州省新建农业生产合作社两万四千多个，少数民族地区的农业生产合作社也有了很大发展。据六个专区统计，已建立少数民族农业生产合作社和民族联合社四千四百九十七个。在今年七月以前，全省已有六千四百个农业生产合作社，加上新建立的社，现在共有三万多个，基本上达到乡乡有社，而且出现了一些合作化了的村庄。为了适应今后农业生产合作社的大量发展，贵州省计划到今年年底训练十万名农民积极分子。目前，据各地不完全统计，已分批训练了四万三千多名建社骨干分子。
    江苏省到目前为止，新建立农业生产合作社两万个，达到发展计划的百分之三十点九。今年各地早、中稻等秋庄稼丰收，农民积极要求在秋种前建社，已申请办社的互助组达十四万个。泗阳县委根据群众要求，已批准建成八百七十三个新社，入社农户一万八千三百九十五户；四百四十五个老社也进行了扩大。现在全县连老社已有二千三百多个，入社农户占全县总农户的百分之四十六点八，并已有合作化乡六十六个。宿迁县到八月底止，已建成新社一千四百九十个，参加的农户有三万四千四百八十六户，连同老社扩大在内，入社农户占全县总农户的百分之四十八点七，已完成全县今冬明春农业生产合作社的发展计划。过去发展迟缓的泰县，八月份建成或正在建立的新社就有八百三十五个。
    四川省今年秋前有三十九万多户农民入社，仅温江、内江、江津、遂宁、泸州、乐山六个专区，秋前就新建一万多个农业生产合作社。今年秋收前后，四川省部分地区已出现合作化高潮，特别是原有的两万八千多个社增加生产增加收入的鲜明事实，更加鼓舞了广大农民入社热情。简阳县一万七千多户农民看到老社小春普遍增产百分之二、三十后，忙着申请报名入社。秋收分配后，仁寿县有三千二百五十五个互助组由组转办成社。现在各地新建社正紧张地展开秋收秋耕和秋种活动。
    据新华社广州十五日电　广东省二百多个渔业生产合作社经过今年上半年以来的整顿后，已得到巩固。许多合作社对工具折价过低、折价费偿还时间过长等现象进行了调整。现在，全省大部分深海作业的合作社推行了“包产、包管、包修”的生产专责制度，并按季按月制定生产计划。粤东区和海南岛的渔业生产合作社中，有近百分之七十的社在定额包产后还实行了超额生产的奖励制。
    六月份以来渔业生产进入了淡季，这个时期中，绝大部分生产合作社根据当地的海流、气候、渔汛等情况实行两种到三种的作业，争取做到淡季不淡。一向操拖网作业的多兼营钓鱼和围网作业；浅水作业的就兼向深水作业发展。海南岛陵水县第一生产合作社兼施七种作业，有风时拖网，风平浪静时放围网，强风时在港内拉大网，结果天天捕鱼，完全消灭了淡季，今年上半年比去年同期增产百分之七十六点六。
