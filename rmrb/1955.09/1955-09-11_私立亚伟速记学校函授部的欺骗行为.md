    The Deceptive Practices of the Correspondence Department of the Private Yawei Stenography School
    Recently, this newspaper has continuously received letters from readers exposing the various illegal activities of the Beijing Private Yawei Stenography School in its long-term use of correspondence courses to carry out deceptive practices.
    The Beijing Private Yawei Stenography School has a specialized course, a training class, and a correspondence department, with a total of 3,851 students, of which 3,748 are in the correspondence department. This is a major fraud. In five years, they printed and distributed more than 570,000 copies of various books, periodicals, and promotional materials (excluding those printed by Yawei Stenography Schools in other locations), boasting that the correspondence method was "convenient and effective," claiming to have established systems for "correcting homework," "sending letters," and "following up on letters," so that "every remote student can receive specific guidance." They used the sweet talk of "introducing high-achieving students to work in government agencies and organizations" to deceive young people eager to participate in work, and also used the practice of "awarding prizes and medals to those who introduce three or more students" to expand the number of enrolled students. As a result, hundreds and thousands of young people in various places were deceived into enrolling.
    But what is the actual situation? The correspondence department only has four or five "teachers," who of course cannot conduct any teaching work for more than 3,700 students. As a result, many students' homework was thrown into the wastepaper basket; when students raised questions and asked for answers, they took the opportunity to promote their own published books. Therefore, participating in correspondence learning is equivalent to spending a lot of money to buy a few worthless booklets. Wang Yugui from the Baoding West Street Office of the Hebei Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China wrote to reflect that the school's promise to guarantee that students would learn stenography in three months was just a deceptive and beautiful lie. Many students found that they had been deceived after enrolling and demanded to withdraw from school, but they stipulated that "no fees will be refunded upon withdrawal," and of course, they did not care how many students withdrew after swindling the money. According to incomplete statistics, the number of students who can maintain their studies until graduation after six months at the Private Yawei Stenography School accounts for only 6.5 percent in the elementary class and only 3.4 percent in the advanced class. Readers' letters reveal that less than two-tenths of one percent of the graduates of this school have learned skills that can be used in their work. Even their own people have said, "Whoever can learn stenography in our correspondence department is truly blessed by their ancestors." When some of the very few graduates requested job recommendations, they maliciously said that "the matter is now handled uniformly by higher authorities, and the school has stopped assigning jobs," to create dissatisfaction with the government among these young people.
    Being able to receive learning materials after paying tuition is still fortunate. More seriously, many students sent money to the school, which was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news. Huang Xudong from Huojia County, Henan Province, wrote to say that he sent the school 4.5 yuan for tuition and requested enrollment, but he did not receive a reply after several letters of inquiry. Although the post office confirmed that the school did receive the money, they kept perfunctorily saying that they "did not receive it." Huang Kejian from the Shenjing Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Fifth District of Panyu County, Guangdong Province, wrote: "I spent more than three yuan and only bought a student ID card!" They even tried to profit from the postage sent by students from various places. Soldiers Wang Xiaoyou and Zheng Jizhong from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Xinjiang wrote: "They asked students to send nine jiao for postage, but in reality, only two jiao were used; they asked students from remote areas to pay an extra four yuan for airmail postage, but they still sent the learning materials by surface mail."
    The books and periodicals published by the Yawei Stenography School also contain many reactionary contents. In October 1950, just as China's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea began, their printed 14th edition of lectures and instruction books contained many extremely reactionary remarks. For example, the inside cover of the instruction book said: "Our biggest enemy is ourselves." "Speaking of the facts, what should be the ambition of Chinese youth? It is to rebuild the Republic of China." When students raised questions one after another, Tang Yawei, the principal of the school, only said that it was a grammatical problem.
    The vast number of readers unanimously pointed out in their letters that such deceptive activities of the Private Yawei Stenography School cannot be tolerated and demanded that the government conduct a thorough investigation and deal with it seriously.

### 私立亚伟速记学校函授部的欺骗行为

    私立亚伟速记学校函授部的欺骗行为
    最近，本报不断接到读者来信，揭发北京私立亚伟速记学校长期以来利用函授业务进行欺骗活动的种种不法行为。
    北京私立亚伟速记学校设有专修科、讲习班和函授部，共有学员三千八百五十一人；其中函授部的学员就有三千七百四十八名。这是一个大骗局。五年中，他们印发了各种书刊和宣传品共五十七万多册（外地亚伟速记学校印发的不计算在内），吹嘘函授方法“便利有效”，自称订有“批改课卷”“发函”“催函”等制度，使“每一个远地的学员都能得到具体的指导”；用“成绩优秀的，介绍到机关团体服务”的花言巧语来欺骗热望参加工作的青年；还用“介绍学员三人以上者，赠给奖品，奖章”的做法来扩大招收学员的人数。因此，各地成百上千的青年受骗而报名参加了学习。
    可是实际情况怎样呢？函授部只有四、五个“教员”，对三千七百多个学员当然不可能进行什么教学工作。于是，不少学员的课卷都被扔到了纸篓里；碰到学员提出问题要求解答的时候，他们就乘机推销自己出版的书刊。因此，学员参加函授学习，等于花很多钱买了几本没有价值的小书罢了。中国人民银行河北省分行保定西大街办事处王玉贵就来信反映：学校说在三个月内保证学员学会速记，这不过是骗人的漂亮话而已。许多学员入学后发现受骗了，纷纷要求退学，但是他们规定“退学不退费”，骗到钱以后当然不在乎有多少学员退学了。据不完全统计，私立亚伟速记学校能维持到六个月毕业的学员数，初级班占百分之六点五，高级班仅占百分之三点四。读者来信揭发说，在这个学校毕业后学成致用的学员不足千分之二。就连他们自己的人也曾说过：“谁能在我们函授部学成速记，真乃祖上有德。”当为数极少的毕业生中某些人要求介绍工作时，他们又恶毒地说是“现由上级统一办理，学校停止分配工作”，来制造这些青年对政府的不满。
    付了学费以后能够拿到学习材料还是幸运的。更严重的是：不少学员把钱寄给学校，就如石沉大海，渺无音信了。河南省获嘉县黄旭东来信说，他寄给学校学费四元五角，请求入学，几次去信催问都没有得到答复，虽然经向邮局查询证明学校里确实收到了钱，但他们却一直搪塞说“没有收到”。广东番禺县第五区深井供销合作社黄克俭来信说：“我花了三块多钱，只买到了一个学员证！”他们连各地学员寄的邮费都要设法从中谋利。中国人民解放军新疆某部战士王孝友、郑继中来信说：“他们要学员寄交邮费九角，实际上只用两角；他们要远地方的学员多交航空邮资四元，但他们仍然用平邮寄发学习材料。”
    亚伟速记学校所出版的书刊上还有着很多反动的内容。一九五○年十月，正当我国抗美援朝运动开始的时候，他们在印发的第十四版讲义和指导书中却有许多极端反动的言论。如，指导书封面里说：“我们最大的敌人就是自己。”“用事实来说，中国青年应该有的志愿是什么呢？是要把中华民国重新建造起来。”当学员纷纷提出质问时，学校校长唐亚伟只说这是语法上的毛病。
    广大读者在来信中一致指出，私立亚伟速记学校这种欺骗活动是决不能容许的，要求政府进行彻查，并严肃处理。
