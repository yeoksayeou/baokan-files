The profound changes in international relations brought about by the Geneva Four-Power Summit have been well received by the British people. The British people sincerely welcome the emergence of a realistic prospect for further easing international tensions and strengthening trust between countries.

In the political commentaries of many newspapers, in the letters from newspaper readers, and in the resolutions of trade unions and social organizations, it is clearly demonstrated that ordinary Britons are eager to block the path of the "Cold War" and the "arms race" and demand that urgent international issues be resolved through negotiation.

An Associated Press correspondent in London, in explaining the mood in Britain, wrote: "These days, it is generally considered inappropriate in London to discuss the 'Cold War' or maliciously talk about Russia... In conversations, political speeches, and newspapers, it is not easy to hear words like 'Soviet threat.'" The correspondent also said that those attempts to diminish the "optimism" of ordinary Britons were drowned out by the "chorus of approval" won by Soviet foreign policy. The correspondent believed: "It seems that the 'Geneva spirit' has taken a firm hold in Britain, causing some ruling figures in the United States and Britain to feel uneasy."

Recently, under the influence of those groups who believe that continuing the "Cold War" and militarization policies are beneficial to them, some articles have appeared in newspapers that attempt to weaken the constantly strengthening mood for peace and international cooperation by various means. They deliberately emphasize the differences between the major powers on various international issues, while avoiding mentioning the convergence of views on many issues, in order to warn the British people not to be "overly optimistic." They also deliberately minimize the significance of many new and important measures taken by the Soviet government and the governments of the People's Democracies to ease international tensions.

It is worth noting that among the London newspapers with the widest circulation, only "The Times" and "The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" published the news of Polish and Albanian disarmament on September 5. An editorial in "The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" admitted: "Instead of warmly welcoming these practices, some people are trying every possible means to diminish their significance." The newspaper tried hard to find excuses for these actions, repeating the lies about the size of the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. However, it admitted that the Soviet Union "sincerely hopes for a relaxation of the situation."

The attempt to influence the British public and force them to abandon their own position has been condemned by many influential newspapers. "The People," a reputable Sunday newspaper with a circulation of more than five million, refuted on the 4th the arguments of two Western politicians who attempted to intimidate the British people with lies such as the Soviet threat. The newspaper wrote that Goebbels also used this method to shout about the dangers of Bolshevism and tried to create disputes between Russia and the Western world. It said: "We truly hope to develop friendly relations with the Russians, which should be a major first step towards solving political and military problems. Attempts to throw out the old 'Bolshevik ghost' again will only poison the new atmosphere of friendship." The newspaper pointed out: "It is foolish to insist that we only see the Russians talking and not acting. They concluded a treaty with Austria and began to withdraw troops. They reduced their army by 640,000 men... We cannot insist that all of this is just pretense." The newspaper pointed out that those who felt it necessary to say this "are simply creating international conspiracies." (Xinhua News Agency, according to TASS London, September 5)

### 日内瓦会议以后的英国舆论动向

    日内瓦会议以后的英国舆论动向
    日内瓦四国政府首脑会议所引起的国际关系中的深刻变化，在英国人民群众中得到良好的反应。英国人民群众真诚地欢迎进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的信任的现实的前景的出现。
    在许多报纸的政治评论中，在报纸读者来信中，在工会组织和社会团体的决议中，都清楚地表现出普通的英国人渴望堵塞“冷战”和“军备竞赛”的道路，要求以谈判方式解决迫切的国际问题。
    美联社驻伦敦记者在说明英国的情绪时写道：“这些日子里，伦敦人士普遍认为议论‘冷战’或者恶意地谈论俄国是不适宜的……在谈话中，政治演说中和报纸上已经不容易听到像‘苏联威胁’这样的话。”这个记者还说，那些企图降低普通英国人的“乐观情绪”的言论，被苏联外交政策所博得的“一片赞同声”所淹没了。记者认为：“看来，‘日内瓦精神’在英国已占有巩固的地位，美国的和英国的某些执政人士因此而惶惶不安。”
    最近以来，在那些认为继续“冷战”和军国主义化政策于己有利的集团的影响下，报纸上出现了一些文章，这些文章企图用各种方法来削弱正在不断加强的、有利于和平和国际合作的情绪。它们故意强调大国在各种国际问题上的分歧，而对于在许多问题上观点的接近避而不谈，借以警告英国人不要“过分乐观”。它们还故意缩小苏联政府和人民民主国家政府为了缓和国际紧张局势所采取的许多新的重要措施的意义。
    值得注意的是，在销路最广的伦敦报纸中间，九月五日只有“泰晤士报”和“每日电讯与晨邮报”刊载了波兰和阿尔巴尼亚裁军的消息。“每日电讯与晨邮报”的社论承认：“有人不但不去热烈欢迎这些做法，反而在千方百计地缩小这些做法的意义”。这家报纸竭力为这些行动寻找借口，重复那些关于苏联和人民民主国家武装部队数量的谰言。但是，它承认，苏联“真诚地希望局势缓和”。
    那种想影响英国公众、迫使他们放弃他们自己的立场的企图，遭到许多有影响的报纸的谴责。发行份数在五百万份以上的有声望的星期日报纸“人民报”四日驳斥了两个西方政客的论调，因为他们企图用什么苏联方面的威胁一类谎话来恫吓英国人。这家报纸写道，戈培尔也曾用这种方式大叫布尔什维克的危险性，而极力在俄国同西方世界之间制造纠纷。它说：“我们真正希望同俄国人发展友好关系，这应当是走向解决政治和军事问题的道路上的重大的第一步。企图把陈旧的‘布尔什维克鬼影’再度抛出来的做法只会毒化友好的新气氛。”这家报纸指出：“硬说我们只看到俄国人说话而没有行动，这种说法是愚蠢的。他们同奥地利缔结了条约，并且开始撤退军队。他们裁减了军队六十四万人……我们不能硬说这一切都是装腔作势。”报纸指出，那些认为有必要这样说的人“只是在制造国际阴谋”。（新华社据塔斯社伦敦五日讯）
