New U.S. Plot to Interfere in Middle Eastern Affairs
		Cui Qi

On August 26, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement on the Middle East issue, proposing a so-called "Middle East Peace Plan." This plan suggests using U.S. loans as "compensation" and donations for "water development projects" to resolve the Arab refugee problem, while also establishing a "collective measures" treaty with U.S. participation to "ensure security."

Dulles attempted to create the impression that the United States was appearing as a mediator, seeking to resolve the disputes between Israel and Arab countries. However, the peaceful cloak he carefully wove was quickly torn apart. In recent days, the broad public and public opinion in Middle Eastern countries have risen up to oppose Dulles's proposals. Egypt's "Voice of the Arabs" radio station pointed out that the purpose of Dulles's proposal is to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries and force them to obey the will of Western countries. Syria's "Al-Ayyam" newspaper said that these proposals are a new attempt to exert pressure on Arab countries under the pretext of establishing stability in the Middle East.

In fact, Dulles's "Peace Plan" has not brought the slightest breath of peace to the Middle East. On the contrary, the United States is even willing to create an atmosphere of war in order to force Middle Eastern countries to accept Dulles's proposals. The United Press International deliberately claimed the day after Dulles issued his statement that "war in the Middle East could break out at any time." This is clearly an attempt to make relations between Israel and Arab countries even more strained.

People know that Israelis and Arabs have a long history of peaceful coexistence, and there is no objective basis for conflict between them. The so-called Palestinian dispute is entirely caused by the imperialist policies of Western countries in the Middle East. As early as World War I, in order to prevent the development of the Palestinian people's national independence movement, Britain supported a large number of Jews scattered around the world to migrate to Palestine with ulterior motives, and provoked relations between Jews and Arabs, creating long-term disputes between them. After World War II, American forces gradually penetrated the Middle East, squeezing out British forces and wooing and provoking both Jews and Arabs, which made the situation in Palestine increasingly deteriorated and complicated. This evil policy of Anglo-American imperialism and the contradictions between them undermined the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on the Palestinian issue in 1947, and finally led to the Palestinian War in 1948. It caused a large number of Israeli and Arab people to shed blood, displaced hundreds of thousands of Arab refugees, and caused great suffering to the people of Middle Eastern countries.

However, since the Palestinian truce in 1949, the situation there has been unstable because imperialism has not abandoned its policy of provocation and interference. The United States has tried its best to use the disputes between Israel and Arab countries to continuously carry out expansion activities. For example, in 1953, the United States suggested that the United Nations send "international forces" to guard the borders between Israel and Arab countries, attempting to use this to send American troops into Palestine. In 1954, the United States also conspired to sign a "mutual defense agreement" with Israel, wanting to implement military occupation of Israel. The purpose of these activities is to establish a springboard for the United States to further intervene in the Middle East in Palestine, a transportation and strategic location in the Middle East. Now, it is not difficult to see that Dulles's "Middle East Peace Plan" is also a new plot based on this purpose.

Dulles knows that water resources are the lifeline of many countries in the Middle East, so he chose to use "water development projects" as bait. However, the essence of this plan has long been seen through by the people of the Middle East. Since 1953, U.S. Presidential Envoy Johnston has visited the Middle East several times to promote his formulated water development plan for the Jordan River. His purpose is to tie the four countries in the Jordan River basin, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan, to the U.S. economic ties, so that American forces can infiltrate these countries to gradually dominate their economic lifelines. At the same time, this plan greatly facilitates the United States to carry out provocation and alienation against these countries, and can use this to interfere in their lives and manipulate their policies. Therefore, when Johnston visited the Middle East earlier this year, Lebanon's "Al-Anbaa" pointed out: "The Johnston Plan is a step to establish foreign rule over our water resources and facilitate U.S. expansion in Arab countries."

Of course, the main attempt of Dulles's "Peace Plan" is not here. It is trying to use the pretext of rescuing Arab refugees and mediating the Palestinian dispute to deceive Middle Eastern countries into accepting a "collective security measure" controlled by the United States, thereby tying more Middle Eastern countries together as a means for the United States to organize military blocs in the Middle East. Dulles's so-called "reconciliation" between Israel and Arab countries is not at all for the benefit of the people of Israel and Arab countries, nor is it for the peace and security of the Middle East, but to eliminate certain obstacles in order to put together a broad Middle East military bloc. The United Press reported that "the West very much hopes to include Israel in the Middle East defense organization, but due to the firm opposition of Arab countries, the establishment of this defense organization is being hindered." An Associated Press dispatch on July 27 said more bluntly: "For many years, the United States has been conducting such propaganda in the Middle East: the countries there should stop arguing with each other and should unite to oppose the common danger of communism that the United States considers to be." It can be seen that the United States is conspiring to drag Middle Eastern countries onto a dangerous path.

The U.S. policy of organizing military blocs in the Middle East is fundamentally incompatible with the interests of the people of Middle Eastern countries, so it has suffered constant setbacks. This has forced the United States to change its approach repeatedly. In 1951, the United States directly suggested the establishment of the "Middle East Command," but it completely went bankrupt. Since then, especially this year, it has turned to hiding behind the scenes, splitting Arab countries, and attempting to drag Middle Eastern countries into military blocs individually or in pairs. To this end, the United States created the Turkish-Iraqi treaty and applied various types of base pressure on Middle Eastern countries, wanting to expand this treaty. However, these activities did not achieve its expected goals. On the contrary, the imperialist face of the United States has been further exposed in front of the people of the Middle East. It was under these circumstances that Dulles proposed the so-called "Middle East Peace Plan." He wanted to open another path, continue the old conspiracy through the Palestinian dispute, and save the United States' poor influence in the Middle East. It was also under these circumstances that U.S. Vice President Nixon announced that he would "visit" the Middle East in November to "repair the broken walls of the United States there."

These activities of the United States that threaten the security of the Middle East are supported by Britain, and at the same time, they have deepened the contradictions between the United States and Britain in the Middle East. United Press International said on December 8, 1954: The United States and Britain have different plans in the activities of putting together the Middle East bloc. Britain wants to "restore its prestigious and influential position in this region," but "Britain has almost completely lost its territory in this region after the war and let the United States benefit. The competition between the United States and Britain for the valuable Middle East market and the friendship of Arab countries (?) is a prominent feature of the two countries' policies towards the Arab world recently." Now, this situation is continuing to develop. After Dulles's "Middle East Peace Plan" was published, Britain's response was lukewarm, but at the same time it immediately stated that "the British government is also willing to contribute." This open and secret struggle between Anglo-American imperialism is often one of the important factors of instability in the Middle East situation.

The people of Middle Eastern countries, who have long suffered from imperialist oppression and ravage, know where their disasters come from and who threatens their peace and security. At the United Nations Political Committee in December 1954, the Syrian representative said well: "Who is the Arab world threatened by that needs to be defended? Until now, the acute problem of the Arab world has been caused by its relations with the West. In the past 150 years, the troubles of the Arab world have always come from the West." Egypt's "Voice of the Arabs" radio station recently also said that the United States is the root cause of all the difficulties in the Arab world. The unanimous call of the broad people of the Middle East is: No foreign intervention!

The people of all countries in the world sympathize with and support the struggle of the people of Middle Eastern countries for independence and freedom, and are concerned about the stability of the Palestinian situation. The Asian Countries Conference and the historic Asian-African Conference held this year condemned the policies of certain countries to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries and establish military blocs, and supported the rights of the Arabs in Palestine, demanding the peaceful settlement of the Palestinian issue. All honest people believe that the United States must stop interfering in Middle Eastern affairs, let the people of Middle Eastern countries decide their own affairs, and resolve the Palestinian dispute through peaceful consultations. Only in this way will it be in line with the interests of the people of Middle Eastern countries and will help to ensure peace and security in the Middle East.

    美国干涉中近东事务的新策划
    崔奇
    八月二十六日，美国国务卿杜勒斯就中近东问题发表声明，提出了一个所谓“中东和平方案”。这个方案建议由美国贷款作为“赔偿金”和捐款进行“水力发展计划”，来解决阿拉伯难民问题，同时订立一个有美国参加的“集体措施”条约以“保证安全”。
    杜勒斯企图给人造成一种印象，仿佛美国是以调停人身份出现，谋求解决以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的纠纷问题。但是，他所精心编织的和平外衣很快地就被揭破了。这些天来，中近东国家的广大公众和舆论纷纷起来反对杜勒斯的建议。埃及“阿拉伯之声”电台指出，杜勒斯建议的目的在于干涉阿拉伯国家内政，并强使它们听从西方国家的意志。叙利亚“埃沙姆报”说，这些建议是一个想在建立中东稳定局面的借口下，对阿拉伯国家施加压力的新企图。
    事实上，杜勒斯的“和平方案”没有给中近东带来丝毫和平气息。相反地，美国为了迫使中近东国家接受杜勒斯的建议，甚至不惜制造战争空气。美国国际新闻社在杜勒斯发表声明的第二天故意扬言说，“中东战事可能随时爆发”。这显然是企图使以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的关系更加紧张起来。
    人们知道，以色列人和阿拉伯人本来有着和平相处的悠久历史，他们之间并没有发生冲突的客观基础。所谓巴勒斯坦纠纷问题，完全是西方国家对中近东的帝国主义政策所造成的。远在第一次世界大战期间，英国为了阻止巴勒斯坦人民的民族独立运动的发展，就别有用心地支持散居世界各地的大批犹太人移居巴勒斯坦，并挑拨犹太人和阿拉伯人之间的关系，在他们之间制造了长期的纠纷。第二次世界大战以后，美国势力步步伸入中近东，排挤着英国的势力，并对犹太人和阿拉伯人进行两面拉拢，两面挑拨，遂使巴勒斯坦的局势日益恶化和复杂化。美英帝国主义的这种罪恶政策以及它们之间的矛盾，破坏了一九四七年联合国大会关于巴勒斯坦问题的决议，并终于酿成了一九四八年的巴勒斯坦战争。它使大批的以色列人民和阿拉伯国家人民流了血，使几十万阿拉伯难民流离失所，使中近东各国人民遭到极大的痛苦。
    但是，一九四九年巴勒斯坦停战以来，由于帝国主义仍然没有放弃它们的挑拨和干涉政策，那里的局势一直处于不稳定状态中。美国就想尽办法利用以色列和阿拉伯国家的纠纷，不断地进行扩张活动。例如，一九五三年，美国曾建议联合国派遣
  “国际部队”驻守以色列和阿拉伯国家的边界，企图借此把美国军队开进巴勒斯坦。一九五四年，美国又曾阴谋和以色列签订“共同防御协定”，想对以色列实行军事占领。这些活动的目的就是要在巴勒斯坦这个中近东交通和战略要地，建立一个美国进一步插足中近东的跳板。现在，不难看出，杜勒斯提出的“中东和平方案”也就是出于这种目的的新策划。
    杜勒斯深知，水源问题是中近东许多国家的生命线，因此他就选中了用“发展水力计划”作为钓饵。但是，这个计划的实质是中近东人民早已识破了的。从一九五三年起，美国总统特使约翰斯顿就曾几次到中近东活动，推销他所制定的发展约旦河水力计划。他的目的是想把约旦河流域的叙利亚、黎巴嫩、以色列和约旦四个国家一起系在美国经济的纽带上，使美国势力渗入这些国家，以逐步支配这些国家的经济命脉。同时，这个计划大大便于美国对这些国家进行挑拨离间，并可以借此干涉它们的生活，操纵它们的政策。因此，当今年年初约翰斯顿到中近东进行活动时，黎巴嫩“消息报”就指出：“约翰斯顿计划是一个建立外国对我们水源的统治以及便于美国在阿拉伯国家实行扩张的步骤。”
    当然，杜勒斯的“和平方案”的主要企图还不在这里。它是想借救济阿拉伯难民和调解巴勒斯坦纠纷为名，骗取中近东国家接受一个美国控制的“集体安全措施”，从而把更多的中近东国家拴在
  一起，以作为美国在中近东组织军事集团的一种手段。杜勒斯所说的以色列和阿拉伯国家“和解”，完全不是为了以色列和阿拉伯国家人民的利益，更不是为了中近东的和平和安全，而是想借此消除某种障碍，以便拼凑一个广泛的中近东军事集团。合众社曾报道说：“西方很希望把以色列包括在中东防御组织以内，但是由于阿拉伯国家的坚决反对，这种防御组织的建立正在受到阻碍。”美联社七月二十七日电讯说得更露骨：“美国多年来一直在中东进行这样的宣传：那里的国家应当停止互相争吵，而应当团结起来反对美国所认为的共产主义的共同危险。”由此可见，美国正阴谋把中近东各国拉上多么危险的道路上去。
    美国在中近东组织军事集团的政策，是和中近东各国人民的利益根本不相容的，因此它遭到了不断的挫折。这迫使美国不得不屡次改变它的做法。一九五一年，美国曾直接建议成立“中东司令部”，结果完全破产了。从此以后，特别是今年以来，它转而躲在幕后，分裂阿拉伯国家，企图单个地或成双地把中近东各国拖进军事集团。为此美国就制造了土耳其—伊拉克条约，并对中近东国家施行了各种类型的卑劣的压力，想把这个条约扩大。可是，这些活动并没有达到它的预期目的。相反地，美国的帝国主义面目，在中近东人民面前更加暴露了。正是在这种情况下，杜勒斯提出了所谓“中东和平方案”。他想开辟另外一条门路，通过巴勒斯坦纠纷问题继续进行老阴谋，并挽救美国在中近东的恶劣影响。也正是在这种情况下，美国副总统尼克松宣布要在十一月“访问”中近东，以“修补美国在那里的破了的围墙”。
    美国这些威胁中近东安全的活动，是得到英国的支持的，同时它也加深了美英之间在中近东的矛盾。合众社一九五四年十二月八日说过：美英在拼凑中近东集团活动中有着不同的打算，英国是要“恢复它在这个地区的有威望和有影响的地位”，但是“英国战后在这个地区几乎完全失去了它的地盘而让美国沾了光。英美两国竞相争夺宝贵的中东市场和阿拉伯国家的友谊（？），是最近两国对阿拉伯世界的政策的显著特点。”现在，这种情形正在继续发展中。杜勒斯的“中东和平方案”发表后，英国的反应是冷淡的，但同时它又立即表示“英国政府也愿意作出贡献”。美英帝国主义这种明争暗斗，经常是中近东局势不稳定的重要因素之一。
    长期遭受帝国主义压迫和蹂躏的中近东各国人民，知道他们的灾难来自什么地方，他们的和平和安全受到谁的威胁。在一九五四年十二月联合国政治委员会上，叙利亚代表说得好：“阿拉伯世界受到谁的威胁而需要保卫呢？直到目前为止，阿拉伯世界的尖锐问题一直是由于同西方的关系而产生的。在过去一百五十年中，阿拉伯世界的烦扰总是来自西方。”埃及“阿拉伯之声”电台最近也说，美国是阿拉伯世界的一切困难的根源。中近东广大人民的一致呼声是：不要外国干涉！
    世界各国人民都同情和支持中近东各国人民争取独立自由的斗争，并关心巴勒斯坦局势的稳定。今年举行的亚洲国家会议和具有历史意义的亚非会议，谴责了某些国家干涉中近东国家内政和建立军事集团的政策，并支持巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人的权利，要求实现巴勒斯坦问题的和平解决。一切正直人们都认为，美国必须停止对中近东事务的干涉，让中近东各国人民自己决定自己的事情，通过和平协商方式解决巴勒斯坦的争端。只有这样，才会符合中近东各国人民的利益，并有助于保障中近东的和平与安全。
