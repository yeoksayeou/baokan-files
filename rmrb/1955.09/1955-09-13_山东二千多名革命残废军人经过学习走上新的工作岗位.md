    Over Two Thousand Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers in Shandong Embark on New Jobs After Studying
    In early September, more than 2,600 students from the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Accelerated Secondary School took up their posts. They were assigned to work in various departments of the provincial grain and public security systems and in rural work teams.
    These students were revolutionary disabled soldiers who were gloriously wounded in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, with Party members and Communist Youth League members accounting for more than 70%. Before entering the school, most of them were illiterate or semi-illiterate. After two to four years of study, they have improved to a high school or junior high school cultural level. When they learned that they would be assigned work ahead of schedule due to work needs, they were all overjoyed and offered unconditional guarantees to obey the assignments. (Gong Xiufu)

    山东二千多名革命残废军人经过学习走上新的工作岗位
    九月上旬，山东省革命残废军人速成中学有两千六百多名学员走上工作岗位。他们分别被分配到省粮食、公安系统各机关和农村工作队工作。
    这些学员都是在抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝斗争中光荣负伤的革命残废军人，其中党员团员占百分之七十以上。他们在入学前大部是文盲或半文盲，经过两年至四年的学习，已提高到高中或初中的文化水平。当他们知道由于工作需要提前出校分配工作后，个个兴高采烈，纷纷提出无条件地服从分配的保证。　（宫秀夫）
