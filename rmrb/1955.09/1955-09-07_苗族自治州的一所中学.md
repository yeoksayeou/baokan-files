    A Middle School in the Miao Autonomous Prefecture
    Yong Rong
    The Jishou National Middle School of Hunan Province is located on the bank of the Wanrong River in Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture. This school was transformed from the Hunan Provincial No. 13 Middle School in 1952, according to the wishes of the Miao people after liberation. From 1952 to 1954, the government allocated more than 328,000 yuan for the school's construction and various subsidies, newly built and renovated school buildings of more than 11,500 square meters, and newly built 24 large classrooms and five large dormitories for boys and girls that can accommodate more than 1,000 people. The newly built library has more than 5,400 books of various kinds and more than 70 kinds of newspapers, magazines, and picture albums. The newly built physics and chemistry instrument laboratory has more than 20 precision microscopes and various animal, plant, and mineral specimens and models. The school has a school clinic that provides timely prevention and treatment of diseases for students. The incidence of gastrointestinal diseases and malaria among students has dropped from 12% in 1951 to 5% now. Hookworm disease and skin diseases, which accounted for a large proportion of Miao students in the past, have now basically disappeared.
    This year, there are 1,028 Miao and Han students in this national middle school, including 308 Miao students, an increase of nearly fifteen times compared with before liberation. More than 90% of Miao students enjoy scholarships and in-kind subsidies. Before liberation, it was extremely difficult to find a Miao junior high school graduate in the Miao-populated areas. Among the 285 students graduating from this school this year, in addition to 44 Miao junior high school graduates, there are also 9 Miao senior high school graduates. All nine senior high school graduates applied to colleges and universities this year.
    Miao students study very diligently at school. Teachers also pay special attention to the characteristics of Miao students in their teaching. Miao students have poor Chinese language proficiency and weak comprehension ability, so teachers guide them to read popular reading materials and use practical examples to make analogies when lecturing. Teachers also pay attention to adopting heuristic and inductive methods so that Miao students can answer difficult questions, in order to establish and enhance their self-confidence. Miao junior high school student Long Zhiwen had poor Chinese language proficiency and could not keep up with the class when he first entered the school, and he was also not cheerful. After the school's education, his Chinese language class improved rapidly, and his personality became cheerful. He has performed well in all aspects of the school and has been accepted as a member of the Communist Youth League and elected as the organization member of the Communist Youth League general branch committee. After graduating from junior high school this year, he has been admitted to senior high school.
    Miao students are free to participate in their favorite ethnic cultural and recreational activities at school. Miao male students often practice boxing, knife dancing, halberd dancing, lion dancing, and singing Miao songs, and perform at weekend evening parties or other gatherings. The school also specifically collects the most beautiful patterns of lace, fancy clothes, and fancy belts that Miao female students like, for them to study in art classes.

    苗族自治州的一所中学
    永镕
    湖南省吉首民族中学，设在湘西苗族自治州吉首县万溶江畔。这所学校是解放后根据苗族人民的要求，在一九五二年由湖南省立十三中学改成的。从一九五二年到一九五四年，政府拨给这个学校的修建费和各种补助费达三十二万八千多元，新建和改建校舍一万一千五百多平方公尺，新建了二十四间大课堂和五大幢能容纳一千多人的男、女生宿舍。新建的图书馆里藏有五千四百多册各种图书和七十多种报纸、杂志、画册。新建的理化仪器实验室里有精密的显微镜二十多台和各种动、植、矿物标本和模型。学校里设有校医室，及时为学生预防和治疗疾病，学生中患肠胃病和疟疾的，由一九五一年的百分之十二降到现在的百分之五。过去在苗族学生中占很大比例的蛔虫病和皮肤病，现已基本绝迹。
    今年，这所民族中学里，有苗、汉族学生一千零二十八人，其中有苗族学生三百零八人，比解放前增加了近十五倍。苗族学生百分之九十以上享受着助学金和实物补助的待遇。解放前在苗族聚居地区要找一个苗族初中毕业学生，是极不容易的。今年这个学校毕业的二百八十五名学生中，除有苗族初中毕业生四十四人外，还有苗族高中毕业生九人。这九名高中毕业生今年全部报考了高等学校。
    苗族学生在学校里学习都很用心。教师们在教学中也特别照顾到苗族学生的特点。苗族学生的语文程度差，理解能力弱，教师就指导他们阅读通俗读物，讲课时也多引用实际例子打比方。教师还注意采取启发和诱导方式，使苗族学生能答出疑难问题，以树立和增强他们的自信心。苗族初中学生龙治文，初入校时语文程度很差，跟不上班，性情也不开朗；经过学校的教育，语文课进步很快，性情也变得开朗了，在学校里各方面的表现都很好，已被吸收为青年团员，并被选为青年团总支委员会组织委员。他今年从初中毕业后已考取了高中。
    苗族学生在学校里可以自由地参加他们所喜爱的本民族的文娱活动。苗族男学生经常练习打拳、舞刀、舞义、舞狮子和演唱苗歌，在周末晚会或其他集会上演出。学校里还专门为苗族女学生搜集她们所喜爱的花边、花衣、花带等最美丽的图案，供她们在美术课堂上研究。
