    The Haymaking and Storage Movement in the Hulunbuir Grassland
    In recent years, the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has promoted a large number of mowing machines and raking machines in the Hulunbuir Grassland. According to statistics from four banners in the Hulunbuir League pastoral area, there are more than 560 machines. Herdsmen use machines to cut grass, which not only reduces heavy physical labor but also greatly increases the amount of grass cut. Each mowing machine can cut more than 10,000 catties of grass per day, which is equivalent to the labor of more than a dozen people in one day. Last year, there were 516 mowing machines in the four banners of the pastoral area, which cut a total of 5.5 million poods of grass (32 catties per pood), an average of about 3 poods per livestock, an increase of one to two times compared with previous years. This year, the haymaking task of these four banners is 7,874,000 poods, an average of about 9 poods per livestock. Before the start of this year's haymaking work, the herdsmen of each banner made full preparations. The leaders at all levels first formulated plans and divided the hayfields. The four banners trained and cultivated more than 200 male and female herdsmen drivers, and also trained more than 100 horses to pull the mowing machines, plus more than 200 horses trained last year, totaling more than 300 horses. Since mid-July, more than 430 mowing machines and raking machines have all been put into production. In addition, more than 1,000 herdsmen using scythes have also joined the haymaking and storage movement. As of the end of August, some banners have completed about 60% of the original plan.

    呼伦贝尔草原的打草储草运动
    内蒙古自治区人民委员会近几年来在呼伦贝尔草原上推广了大量打草机和搂草机。现据呼伦贝尔盟牧区四个旗的统计就有五百六十多台。牧民们使用机器打草，不但减轻了繁重的体力劳动，而且大大增加了打草量。每台打草机每天能打一万多斤草，相当于十几个人工一天的劳动。去年牧区四个旗共有五百一十六台打草机，共打草五百五十万普特（每普特三十二斤），每头牲畜平均三普特左右，较往年增加一至两倍。今年这四个旗的打草任务是七百八十七万四千普特，每头牲畜平均九普特左右。今年打草工作开始前，各旗牧民都作了充分准备，各级领导首先制定了计划，划分了打草场，四个旗共训练和培养了二百多名男女牧民驾驶员，还训练了一百多匹拉打草机的马，加上去年训练的二百多匹共三百多匹马。从七月中旬开始，有四百三十多台打草机和搂草机全部投入了生产，另外，还有一千多名牧民使用镰刀也投入了打草储草运动。截至八月底，有的旗已完成原订计划百分之六十左右。（赛音）
