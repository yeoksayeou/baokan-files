Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 19th (TASS): Khrushchev made the following speech on September 19, 1955, during the negotiations between the Soviet and German Democratic Republic government delegations:

　　I completely agree with everything Comrade Bulganin said on this matter.

　　I would like to talk about the great significance of the close cooperation between the various parties united in the National Front of Democratic Germany for the development of the German Democratic Republic, based on our opinions.

　　We all understand that the joint activities of these parties and their leaders have played a significant role in the great achievements of the German Democratic Republic in developing its economy and culture, in establishing friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, and in further consolidating this relationship.

　　Speaking of the significance of the National Front, I would also like to mention the fruitful activities of Professor Correns, Chairman of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany.

　　The sincere and comprehensive cooperation between the various parties of the National Front is your guarantee for forward progress. Therefore, I would like to express the hope that for the further rise of the economy of the German Democratic Republic and the material welfare of its residents, for the sake of the German people and for world peace, this close cooperation between these parties can achieve greater success.

　　We understand that achieving this cooperation is not a simple task.

　　In practical life, it is not so easy for various parties to reach mutual understanding and cooperation on all issues. Indeed, some issues may arise, on which there will be different opinions. In resolving these issues, it is necessary to demonstrate political wisdom. Since there is a league of parties, the interests of the parties joining this league must be taken into account, and methods of solving all issues must be sought and found. Obviously, in doing so, it is necessary to act in a spirit of mutual tolerance, but this tolerance should not harm the basic goals put forward by the German Democratic Republic. Only in this way can the league of parties be continuously consolidated, thereby continuously increasing the achievements of the German Democratic Republic.

　　The task facing the German people, which concerns millions of Germans, is to reunify Germany into a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. We are always ready to do everything possible to promote the successful resolution of this task. We are realists; therefore, in solving any political problem, including this one, we should calmly assess the situation that has formed. To make the restoration of German unity beneficial to the German people and the people of European countries, it does not depend solely on one side. It involves both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. In addition, there are the four countries bound by certain terms and obligations, which still hold different opinions on the German question. Therefore, we should not have illusions.

　　As everyone knows, the foreign ministers of the four countries will soon meet in Geneva, and the German question will be included on the agenda along with other issues. Our view on this issue is clear. I would like to talk about specific facts in my speech now. The fact is this: of the four foreign ministers preparing to meet in Geneva, three countries participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and only one country does not participate in this organization. Moreover, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is opposed to this country. The three governments and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany want to restore German unity according to their conditions, and want the reunified Germany to also join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I believe that this path is not in the interests of the German people, nor in the interests of the security of the people of European countries and the relaxation of international tensions. We can in no way agree to this development of events, the consequences of which would only strengthen the North Atlantic military group aimed against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Therefore, in negotiations with representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, we frankly said to Mr. Adenauer: Please do not ask us for what we cannot promise. We cannot assist your plan to restore German unity, we cannot assist the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that is, the organization aimed against us and the cause of peace. I think that in similar circumstances, the Germans would do the same.

　　The signing and entry into force of the Paris Accords and the accession of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have created serious obstacles to reuniting the two parts of Germany into a unified German state.

　　Now the question arises: how to satisfy the German people's desire for reunification; should the current situation continue permanently? Our answer is clear and affirmative, that is, the Germans should solve this problem themselves. The Germans should sit down at a table! No one can solve the German problem better than the Germans themselves. The reunification of Germany should proceed in such a way that the unified German state is a peace-loving and democratic country, so that the strength of the German state is not directed against other countries. We will do our best to promote such a solution to the German problem.

　　Under the current circumstances, it is obviously a difficult matter to resolve the German problem on this basis. Not long ago, we met and talked with representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany. The negotiations with representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany illustrated that there are significant difficulties on the road to a rapid solution to this problem. During a break in the negotiations with the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Adenauer wanted to convince me that the North Atlantic Group seemed to be established for the purpose of peace, and that this organization did not threaten the Soviet Union in the slightest.

　　And we are very clear that the Paris Accords are military agreements. We are also clear that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established as a military organization, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has its commander of armed forces in Europe - General Gruenther. Therefore, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not a sports organization, and its establishment is not to prepare for sports competitions and football matches. Everyone knows that Gruenther is not a football coach, who doesn't know that he is a general, he "trains a team" for war, and precisely for war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This is something that cannot be ignored.

　　Some people want to prove to us that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established for defensive purposes. We also said to some member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established for defense, then we are also willing to join this "defensive organization." However, as everyone knows, the Soviet Union was not allowed to join. This fact also shows that the spearhead of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is directed against the Soviet Union.

　　It is very clear that the entry into force of the Paris Accords and the accession of the Federal Republic of Germany to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have created serious obstacles to resolving the German problem. We pointed out the only correct path - that the German people should solve this problem with their own hands. The Germans will find the correct way to solve this problem.

　　If I say that the German nation and the Soviet people are both concerned about having peaceful and friendly relations, I think I am expressing a common opinion.

　　I would like to say: it is clear that in a certain period of time, we must consider the fact that there are two countries in Germany - the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

　　Genuine friendly relations have developed between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet government will also make the same efforts to develop friendly relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, and will strive to promote the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany.

　　I would like to say a few words as a communist and the secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union - I do not force everyone present to accept my views: the highest goal of our party, which follows the doctrines of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, is to build communism. We strive to eliminate the phenomenon of man exploiting man, to make people friendly to each other, and to make labor and science benefit all the people. If the people of all countries embark on this path of development, then not only will there be no possibility of war, but there will also be no possibility of any armed conflict.

　　The working people of the German Democratic Republic have embarked on the road of socialist construction. This is a historically significant event in the lives of the German people. You have received our support on this road. We hope that you will achieve complete success in your great constructive work. We believe that you can achieve new victories on this road. The socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic is a very important undertaking, and it is even difficult to properly express the full significance and greatness of this undertaking with language now. The socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic is in the interests of all the working people of Germany. Many workers who have joined the German Social Democratic Party, the German Christian Democratic Union and other parties will also devote themselves to promoting the construction of a socialist Germany. However, to strive for the construction of socialism and for the construction of a socialist Germany is, of course, the internal affair of the German working class itself and the German people.

　　I should state that the task of the Soviet state is to establish good and friendly relations of good neighborliness with all the German people. We have no doubt that the leaders of the German Democratic Republic are also striving in this direction.

　　Chancellor Adenauer of the Federal Republic of Germany also said during negotiations in Moscow that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is committed to developing friendly relations with the Soviet people. I have no right to doubt this statement. We will welcome these good words to be confirmed by good facts. We know that the words and guarantees of the representatives of the German Democratic Republic who are successfully negotiating with us are consistent with practical actions, and we are confident that this will continue to be the case in the future. Our friendship and mutual trust will be increasingly consolidated.

　　We also hope that the relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will also develop satisfactorily in the future. However, as the Russian proverb says, time will tell. We, for our part, will do everything possible to ensure that the relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany develop smoothly. Both the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany have a stake in extensively expanding trade and cultural ties. Doing so will be of great benefit to the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, and the Soviet Union.

　　I would also like to talk about a special issue - the issue of former prisoners of war who were sentenced by Soviet courts as war criminals. You all remember that when Comrade Bulganin and I returned from Geneva via Berlin, we exchanged views with you on this issue. President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic wrote a letter to Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, on this issue.

　　When the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany came to us, it also raised this issue with us, and linked this issue with the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. We said to Mr. Adenauer and the members of the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany that this issue had nothing to do with negotiations on the establishment of diplomatic relations, and that this issue could only be resolved by the Soviet Union, because these people had committed crimes against the Soviet people, and that is why they were sentenced by Soviet courts. However, time is passing, and people are changing with it. Some people turn for the better, and others turn for the worse. But most people turn for the better. Therefore, we believe that we can agree to the request to release these people early.

　　We take into account that they have their own relatives and friends, who are waiting for these fathers, sons, husbands and brothers. We understand that we must take care of this kind of human sentiment. These people have served a considerable period of their sentence, and we hope that they will correctly estimate the magnanimity of the Soviet government, and that they will not harbor resentment in their attitude towards the Soviet Union after their release.

　　These are the issues I wanted to talk about in my speech.

　　The draft treaty that the committee has prepared is obviously satisfactory to both of us, which is not common. The most common situation is that people reach a solution to a problem through compromise. There is no compromise between us, because we have no differences of opinion and we have a common worldview. It is true that our Soviet troops are temporarily stationed on your territory, which may cause some unpleasantness, but we are convinced that the necessity of this measure will be correctly understood. We are clearly aware that the stationing of foreign troops, even troops from friendly countries, on a territory does not always win the happiness of the residents. But people can and should understand the necessity of taking this measure under the current circumstances. Our joint decision to have Soviet troops remain on your territory is only a temporary measure. We understand that this is an unpleasant matter, so if someone here says that this is a pleasant decision, then we do not believe such a statement. Do you agree?

　　Ulbricht said: We agree.

　　Khrushchev said: However, we will work with you to resolutely strive to achieve an agreement between countries on a general reduction of armed forces and the withdrawal of troops from the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France stationed in Germany. If the United States, Britain, and France are willing to do so today, then we can solve this problem now. We are willing to withdraw our troops from Germany, but on one condition, that is: our partners in the war against Hitler's Germany will also withdraw their troops.

　　We hope to solve this problem in the future. The Geneva meeting of the heads of government of the four countries has created this hope. We hope that the Geneva spirit will continue to develop and strengthen, and that the Geneva spirit is not that kind of invisible and intangible spirit, but a concrete action like what we have shown on our part, such as our decision to reduce our armed forces by 640,000 people, our abandonment of the Porkkala Udd naval base leased in Finland, and we have taken a series of other measures. We hope that our Geneva partners will also take the same actions, and then we can put forward new proposals on our part. Some bourgeois politicians accuse us of smiling and appearing friendly, but that seems to be all. However, are the facts I listed above regarding the reduction of armed forces and the abandonment of the naval base in Finland not concrete actions aimed at easing international tensions?

　　At the same time, we are waiting for the Western countries to also show concrete results that are conducive to easing international tensions and consolidating peace, and that are in line with the Geneva spirit.

    赫鲁晓夫的发言
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：赫鲁晓夫一九五五年九月十九日在苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表团谈判时发言如下：
    我完全同意布尔加宁同志在这个问题上所说的一切。
    我想根据我们的意见讲一讲团结在民主德国全国阵线里各党派之间的亲密合作对于德意志民主共和国的发展具有怎样重大的意义。
    我们大家都了解，这些党派和它们的领导人的共同活动对于德意志民主共和国在发展经济和文化方面所获得的巨大成绩，在建立德意志民主共和国与苏联之间的友好关系以及在进一步巩固这种关系上是起着重大的作用的。
    讲到全国阵线的意义，我还想提到民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯教授的富有成果的活动。
    全国阵线各党派之间的真诚的全面合作是你们向前发展的保证。因此我想表示这样一种愿望：为了德意志民主共和国的经济和它的居民物质福利的进一步高涨，为了德国人民和为了世界和平，希望这些党派之间的亲密合作能够获得更大的成功。
    我们明白，达成这种合作并不是一个简单的任务。
    在实际生活中，各党派之间就所有的问题达成互相谅解和实行合作并不是那么容易。的确，也会产生一些问题，对这些问题会有不同的看法。在解决这些问题时，需要表现出政治上的英明。既然有各党联盟，就必须考虑到加入这个联盟的各党派的利益，寻求和找出解决所有问题的方法。显然，在这样做时，必须本着互相忍让的精神，但这种忍让不应当损害德意志民主共和国提出的基本目标。只有这样，各党联盟才能够日趋巩固，从而使德意志民主共和国所获得的成果不断增多。
    摆在德国人民面前的、千百万德国人所关心的任务，就是把德国重新统一为一个统一的和平民主的德国。我们时刻准备竭尽一切力量来促进这个任务的圆满解决。我们是现实主义者；因此在解决任何政治问题以及在解决这个问题时，我们都应当冷静地估计到所形成的情况。要使德国统一的恢复既有利于德国人民也有利于欧洲各国人民，这不单单取决于一方面。这里牵涉到德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两方面。此外，还有受一定的条款和义务约束的四国，它们对解决德国问题仍然抱有不同的意见。因此，我们不应当抱有幻想。
    大家知道，四国外长很快就要在日内瓦会晤了，德国问题也将和其他问题一块列入议程。我们对这个问题的观点是明确的。我现在在发言中想谈一谈具体的事实。事实是这样：准备在日内瓦聚会的四国外长中，有三个国家参加了北大西洋集团，只有一个国家没有参加这个组织。而且，北大西洋公约组织是反对这个国家的。三国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府一起想按照它们的条件恢复德国的统一，并且要让恢复统一后的德国也加入北大西洋公约组织。我认为，这条道路是不符合德国人民的利益的，是不符合欧洲各国人民的安全和缓和国际紧张局势的利益的。我们无论如何也不能同意事态的这种发展，它的后果只会加强旨在反对苏联和人民民主国家的北大西洋军事集团。因此，在同德意志联邦共和国代表进行谈判时，我们曾向阿登纳先生开诚布公地说：请不要向我们要求我们不能答应的事。我们不能协助你的那个恢复德国统一的计划，我们不能协助北大西洋公约组织，即旨在反对我们和和平事业的组织。我认为，在类似这样的情况下德国人也会这样做的。
    巴黎协定的签订和生效以及德意志联邦共和国的加入北大西洋公约组织，造成了使德国的两个部分重新统一成为一个统一的德意志国家的严重的障碍。
    现在产生了这样一个问题：如何满足德国人民对重新统一的愿望；难道现在的状况要永久继续下去吗？我们的回答是明确的和肯定的，就是德国人应该自己来解决这一问题。德国人坐到一张桌子上来！没有人比德国人自己能够更好地解决德国问题。德国的重新统一应该这样进行：要使统一的德意志国家是一个爱好和平的和民主的国家，使德意志国家的力量的矛头不致指向其他国家。我们将尽力促使德国问题获得这样的解决。
    在目前的情况下，在这一基础上解决德国问题显然是一件困难的事情。不久前我们曾经同德意志联邦共和国代表会见和进行交谈。同德意志联邦共和国代表的谈判说明了，在迅速解决这一问题的道路上有着重大的困难。在同德意志联邦共和国代表团谈判期间，阿登纳先生在一次休息的时候要我相信说，北大西洋集团好像是为着和平的目的而建立的，好像这一组织丝毫不威胁苏联。
    而我们十分清楚，巴黎协定是军事协定。我们也清楚，北大西洋公约组织是作为一个军事组织而建立的，北大西洋公约组织在欧洲有它的武装部队的统帅——格仑瑟将军。因此，北大西洋公约组织不是一个体育组织，它的成立不是为了准备举行体育比赛和足球赛。大家知道，格仑瑟并不是足球教练，谁不知道他是一个将军，他“训练一支队伍”是为了进行战争，也正是为了对苏联和人民民主国家进行战争。这一点是不能不加以注意的。
    有人想要向我们证明，北大西洋公约组织是为了防御的目的而建立的。我们也曾经向北大西洋公约组织的一些成员国说：如果北大西洋公约组织是为了防御而建立起来的话，那么我们也愿意加入这个“防御性的组织”。可是，大家知道，苏联没有被容许加入。这一事实也就说明，北大西洋公约组织的矛头是针对苏联的。
    十分明显，巴黎协定的生效和德意志联邦共和国的加入北大西洋公约组织，为解决德国问题造成了严重的障碍。我们指出了唯一正确的道路——由德国人民亲手来解决这一问题。德国人会找到正确解决这一问题的道路的。
      如果我说，德意志民族和苏联人民都关心要有一种和平和友好的关系，我想，我是表达了共同的意见的。
    我想说：显然在一定的时期中必须考虑到这个事实：在德国存在有两个国家——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国之间已经发展了真正的友谊关系。苏联政府还将同样地尽力发展同德意志联邦共和国的友谊关系，并且将尽力促进德国两部分的接近。
    我想，作为一个共产党员和苏联共产党中央委员会的书记说几句话——我并不强迫所有在座的人接受我的观点：我们这个遵循马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学说的党的最崇高的目的就是建设共产主义。我们努力要使人剥削人的现象消灭，使人和人互相友好，使劳动和科学造福全体人民。如果各国人民都走上了这条发展的道路，那就不仅没有可能发生战争、而且不会有可能发生任何武装冲突。
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民走上了社会主义建设的道路。这是德国人民生活中的一件有历史意义的大事。你们在这条道路上得到了我们的支持。我们希望你们在巨大的建设性工作中获得完满的成就。我们相信，你们能够在这条道路上获得新的胜利。德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设是一件非常重要的事业，甚至现在很难用语言恰当地表达出这个事业的全部意义和它的伟大。德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设是符合德国全体劳动人民的利益的。许多加入了德国社会民主党、德国基督教民主联盟和其他党派的工人们，也将致力于促进建成一个社会主义的德国。但是，为建设社会主义和为建成一个社会主义的德国而奋斗，这当然是德国工人阶级自己、德国人民的内部事务。
    我应该说明，苏维埃国家的任务是同全体德国人民建立良好的、睦邻的友谊关系。我们毫不怀疑：德意志民主共和国的领导者们也是在朝着这个方向努力的。
    德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳先生在莫斯科谈判期间也说过，德意志联邦共和国政府致力于发展同苏联人民的友好关系。我没有权利怀疑这句话。我们将欢迎这些好话得到良好的事实的证实。我们知道，正在同我们成功地进行会谈的德意志民主共和国代表们的话和保证是同实际行动一致的，我们确信，今后也会这样。我们的友谊和相互信任将日益巩固。
    我们也希望：苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系今后也将得到令人满意的发展。然而俄国的俗话说得好：日久见人心。我们这方面将尽一切努力以使苏联和德意志联邦共和国的关系得到顺利的发展。苏联和德意志联邦共和国双方对广泛展开贸易和文化联系都有利害关系。这样做对德意志联邦共和国、德意志民主共和国和苏联都会有很大的好处。
    我还想就一个特殊的问题——关于被苏联法院作为战犯判了刑的前战俘问题谈一谈。你们都记得，当布尔加宁同志和我从日内瓦回来途经柏林的时候曾就这一问题同你们交换了意见。德意志民主共和国总统皮克同志曾就这一问题给苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志一封信。
    当德意志联邦共和国代表团到我们这里来的时候，它也向我们提出了这一问题，并且把这一问题同建立苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的外交关系的问题联系在一起。我们向阿登纳先生以及德意志联邦共和国政府代表团的团员说，这个问题同建立外交关系的谈判是没有任何关系的，而这个问题只有苏联能够解决，因为这些人对苏联人民犯下了罪行，他们就是因此而被苏联法院判刑的。但是，时间在逝去，人也随着在变化。一些人向好的方面转变，另外一些人向坏的方面转变。不过大多数的人是向好的方面转变。因此我们认为，可以答应提前释放这些人的要求。
    我们考虑到，他们有自己的亲人和戚友，这些亲人和戚友等待他们这些父亲、儿子、丈夫和兄弟。我们懂得，必须照顾到这种人情。这些人已经服了相当一段时间的刑期，我们希望，他们将正确地估计苏联政府的宽宏大量，并且在他们释放后在对待苏联的态度上不怀着报复情绪。
    这些就是我在发言中想要谈到的问题。
      委员会已经拟就的条约草案，显然使我们双方都感到满意，这种情况是不常见的。最常见的情况是，人们通过妥协取得问题的解决。我们之间没有什么妥协，因为我们没有不同看法的争论，因为我们有共同的观点、共同的世界观。不错，我们的苏联军队暂时还留在你们的国土上，这件事可能引起一些不愉快，但是我们深信，这种措施的必要性将被正确地了解。我们清楚地认识到，在领土上驻扎外国、即使是友好国家的军队也不总是博得居民的高兴的。但是人们能够而且应该明白在目前的情况下采取这种措施的必要性。我们共同作出的关于苏联军队留在你们国土上的决定，只是暂时的措施。我们明白，这是一件不愉快的事情，因此如果有人在这里说这是令人愉快的决定，那么我们是不相信这种说法的。你们同意吗？
    乌布利希说：我们同意。
    赫鲁晓夫说：但是，我们将同你们一道，坚定不移地力求做到：国与国之间就普遍裁减武装部队和撤离驻扎在德国的苏、美、英、法四国的军队达成协议。如果美、英、法三国今天愿意这样做的话，那么我们可以在现在就解决这个问题。我们愿意从德国撤离军队，但是有一个条件，就是：我们的对希特勒德国作战时的伙伴也将撤退他们的军队。
    我们希望在将来解决这个问题。四国政府首脑日内瓦会议产生了这种希望。我们希望，日内瓦精神将不断发展和加强，日内瓦精神不是那种看不见和不可捉摸的精神，而是要像我们这方面所表现的那种具体行动，如我们决定裁减武装部队六十四万人，我们放弃在芬兰租借的波卡拉乌德海军基地，我们并且采取了一系列其他措施。我们希望我们的日内瓦伙伴们也采取同样的行动，然后，我们这方面才可以提出新的建议。某些资产阶级政治家责难我们说，我们虽然微笑着，显得友好，但是似乎是仅此而已。然而，难道我上面所列举的关于裁减武装部队和放弃在芬兰的海军基地的这些事实不是目的在缓和国际紧张局势的具体行动吗？
    同时，我们期待着西方国家方面也表现出有助于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的、符合日内瓦精神的具体结果。
