    "Zhaxi Lamu"
    —Remembering the Model Deeds of Youth League Member and Female Doctor Huang Xin
    
      “Zhaxi Lamu” (吉祥神女 - Auspicious Goddess) is the name given to Huang Xin, the female director of the local health clinic and a member of the Youth League, by the Tibetan people of Sanyan Zong in the Qamdo region.

    The origin of this name is as follows: In Ani Village, a woman named Zeren Zhuoma had been suffering from severe dysentery for more than a month and was covered in bedsores. When Huang Xin learned of this, she immediately rushed to treat her, personally sewed a cotton mattress for the patient to lie on, and cleaned her body. Under Huang Xin's day and night care, Zeren Zhuoma recovered after half a month. Her whole family gratefully said, "Zhaxi Lamu" is our "Auspicious Goddess." You are so kind to us, we will call you "Zhaxi Lamu"! When Huang Xin and the health worker left her home, Zeren Zhuoma's family was reluctant to let her go. Huang Xin and the health worker had already climbed a hillside, but they were still standing in front of the door, shouting loudly: "Zhaxi Lamu, come back!" The name "Zhaxi Lamu" spread from then on.

    Huang Xin came to the Kangzang Plateau in 1952 with the Qamdo National Hygiene Work Team of the Ministry of Health. At that time, she had just graduated from Guangxi Medical College. In the summer of 1953, she followed a medical team deep into a remote place called Sanyan in the mountains on the east bank of the Jinsha River in southeastern Qamdo for treatment. The Tibetan people of Sanyan Zong had been isolated from the outside world for a long time and had never seen a doctor. Therefore, when the medical team first arrived, few Tibetans came to them. Huang Xin and the comrades of the medical team climbed mountains and ridges every day to actively look for patients. Sometimes, while helping Tibetans harvest highland barley, they treated them on the edge of the fields. More than two months later, the Tibetans regarded the medical team as their own relatives. In the spring of 1954, when health institutions were generally established in various Zong in the Qamdo area, Huang Xin automatically requested the National Hygiene Work Team to send her to Sanyan Zong to establish a health clinic.

    After the Sanyan Health Clinic was established, sixty or seventy Tibetans came to see a doctor every day. However, no one from the Lower Sanyan, which was separated by a high mountain, had come. One day, Beizhen, the younger sister of Ciweng Wangwan, the headman of Lower Sanyan, suffered from puerperal fever and sent someone to ask them to make a house call. Lower Sanyan was very far from the health clinic. The next day, just as it was dawn, Huang Xin and a Tibetan cadre from the Zong set off. They crossed a mountain more than 5,000 meters above sea level and passed through a primeval forest, arriving at Lower Sanyan that evening. The patient had a fever of over 40 degrees and had been in a coma for five days. Huang Xin didn't have time to rest and immediately started giving the patient injections and medicine, and wiping her body with alcohol to reduce the fever. The Tibetans who were crowded at the door watching were all surprised and praised when they saw the patient gradually wake up. Three days later, Beizhen's illness was cured. She took Huang Xin's hand and said: In the past, there were countless motherless children in the village. Now Chairman Mao has sent doctors to save the children's mothers. From then on, patients from Lower Sanyan also often came to the health clinic.

    For more than a year, Huang Xin and her companions have learned to ask questions in Tibetan. Carrying medicine bags on their backs, they have spent years climbing snow-capped mountains over 4,000 meters above sea level, traveling to dozens of small villages and pastures in Upper and Lower Sanyan, seeing more than 10,000 patients, vaccinating more than 4,000 people with cowpox, and saving many lives. Once, Huang Xin and her companions went on a house call on a night of heavy wind and snow. When they reached a mountain, the snow had buried the road and they couldn't go any further, so they spent the night in the open on the mountainside. The next morning, they found themselves sleeping in a snowdrift. Although the work and life are so hard, the Tibetan people give them infinite warmth, which makes them feel happy. Now, the old people of Sanyan Zong regard Huang Xin as their daughter, and the young people regard her as their sister. When people see her, they greet her affectionately from afar: "Zhaxi Lamu".

    “札西拉姆”
    ——记青年团员、女医生黄欣的模范事迹
    新华社记者  吕南新
      “札西拉姆”（吉祥神女）是昌都地区三岩宗藏族人民送给当地卫生所女所长、青年团员黄欣的名字。
    这个名字的来由是这样的：阿尼村有一个名叫泽仁卓玛的女人害重痢疾已躺了一个多月，混身长满了褥疮。黄欣知道这件事后，马上跑去给她看病，亲手缝一床棉花垫子给病人铺上，还把她浑身上下擦洗干净。在黄欣日夜看守下，半个月后，泽仁卓玛的病就好了，她一家人都感激地说：“札西拉姆”是我们的“吉祥神女”，你对我们这么好，我们就叫你“札西拉姆”吧！当黄欣和卫生员离开她家时，泽仁卓玛一家人都舍不得让她走，黄欣和卫生员已经爬上一个山坡了，她们还站在门前大声地喊：“札西拉姆，回来吧！”“札西拉姆”的名字就从此传开了。
    黄欣是一九五二年随卫生部昌都民族卫生工作大队来到康藏高原的，她那时才从广西医学院毕业。一九五三年夏天，她随一个医疗小组深入到昌都东南金沙江西岸群山里一个叫三岩的偏僻地方治病。三岩宗藏族人民长时期和境外隔绝，从没有见过医生，因此，医疗组刚到时，很少有藏民来找他们。黄欣和医疗组的同志，每天爬山越岭，主动找寻病人，有时候，一边帮助藏民收青稞，一边就在田坎上给藏民治病。两个多月以后，藏民把医疗组当成了自己的亲人。一九五四年春天，昌都地区各宗普遍建立卫生机构时，黄欣就自动向民族卫生工作大队要求派她到三岩宗建立卫生所。
    三岩卫生所成立后，每天都有六、七十个藏民来看病。但是隔着一座高山的下三岩还没有人来过。有一天，下三岩头人次翁旺丸的妹妹贝珍，害了产褥热，派人来请她们出诊。下三岩离卫生所很远，第二天天刚刚亮，黄欣就和宗里一个藏族干部上路了。她们翻过一座拔海五千多公尺的大山，又穿过一片原始森林，当天傍晚赶到下三岩。病人发烧已经到了四十度以上，已经昏迷五天了。黄欣来不及休息，马上就动手给病人打针吃药，用酒精擦身退烧。当时挤在门口看的藏民，见到病人逐渐清醒，都惊喜得啧啧称赞。三天后，贝珍的病就好了。她拉着黄欣的手说：过去村里不知有多少没妈妈的孩子，现在毛主席派来医生，救活孩子们的妈妈了。从此，下三岩也经常有病人来找卫生所了。
    一年多以来，黄欣和她的伙伴们已经学会了用藏话问诊。她们背着药包，成年累月地翻越拔海四千公尺以上的雪山，走遍了上下三岩几十个小村和牧场，看了一万多次病，给四千多人种了牛痘，救活了许多人。有一次，黄欣和她的同伴，在一个大风雪的夜里出诊，走到一座山上，雪已经把路埋了，没法再走，于是就在山腰露宿。第二天一早，她们才发现自己睡在雪堆里面。工作和生活虽然这样艰苦，但藏族人民却给她们无限的温暖，使她们感到幸福。现在，三岩宗的老人们把黄欣看成自己的女儿，青年们把她当成自己的姊妹，人们见了她，老远就亲切地喊：“札西拉姆”。
