    Actively Cultivate New Forces for Scientific Research
    The "Provisional Regulations on Graduate Students of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" has been approved and promulgated by the State Council, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to enroll the first batch of graduate students this year. This is a major measure for our country to formally train more advanced scientific cadres, improve the level of scientific work in our country, and adapt to socialist construction.
    The development of science is of great significance to national construction, and the training of scientific cadres is an important factor in determining the development of science. In the past few years, we have made great efforts in carrying out scientific work and training scientific cadres, but we have not yet established a formal system for training advanced scientific cadres. In addition, our country's science is backward, and there are fewer scientific workers who meet the needs of the people, so the strength of our country's scientific work is still relatively weak. With the development of the planned construction of the national economy, the demands on scientific work from all aspects are increasing day by day. We must train a large number of scientific workers as soon as possible in order to smoothly undertake the huge tasks that the country has put forward for scientific work.
    Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, a large number of young people have joined the ranks of scientific work. They will gradually improve their scientific level in practical work and become skilled scientific workers with theoretical literacy. In addition, the state sends many students to the Soviet Union and other countries to study every year. These are important sources of scientific cadres. However, as the basic form of the state's training of scientific cadres, it should establish a formal graduate student system, select the most outstanding staff or college graduates who are most promising in science, and concentrate on studying and conducting creative research under the guidance of mentors with rich scientific knowledge and a high level of theory. In this way, more advanced scientific cadres who meet certain standards can be trained in a relatively short period of time. Now, our country has entered a period of planned and large-scale construction, scientific work has gradually gotten on track, and the research work of many scientific departments has gradually begun. Under such circumstances, it is entirely necessary and conditional to establish a formal graduate student system to train more advanced scientific cadres.
    According to the Provisional Regulations on Graduate Students of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, after four years of study, graduate students must have a certain level of Marxism-Leninism, a solid foundation in their own science, practical knowledge of relevant national construction, and be able to independently conduct professional creative scientific research work. To ensure the quality of graduate students, we must first rely on strict pre-enrollment recommendation procedures and review and examination systems. Scientific research institutions, universities, and production technology departments of enterprises should encourage the most outstanding and promising young scientific and technical workers in their departments to take the exam. Outstanding in-service cadres with scientific promise in various departments should be a major source for selecting graduate students, and various departments should adopt a positive attitude towards this work. Of course, taking out the most outstanding scientific workers will affect the work and current tasks to a certain extent. However, for the long-term interests of socialist construction and to continuously improve the scientific and technological level of our country, this temporary difficulty should be overcome through efforts. Only in this way can the quality of graduate students be guaranteed. Because in-service cadres with certain practical work experience have better conditions than a newly graduated student. After strict graduate training, these people can quickly become more proficient in specialized business and mature scientific workers with greater creativity, and can make greater contributions to the country's socialist construction.
    The establishment of a formal graduate student system began first with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is only enrolling a small number of graduate students in research institutions that are already qualified. Other research institutions and scientists of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should pay attention to preparing conditions for training graduate students. After the establishment of the graduate student system of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, qualified universities should also establish formal graduate student systems; other universities should also actively create such conditions in conjunction with the development of scientific research work. The establishment of a graduate student system in universities can further improve the teaching quality and the level of scientific research work in schools. Where conditions permit, senior researchers in scientific institutions should guide graduate students in universities, and senior teachers in universities should also guide graduate students in scientific institutions, to further strengthen cooperation between the two parties. The number of scientific research institutions and universities across the country has greatly increased in the past six years, and will continue to develop in the future. If a formal system for training graduate students is gradually established in scientific research institutions and universities across the country, a large number of more advanced scientific cadres and teachers will be successively trained for the country in a few years. We should work towards this direction.
    The key to training graduate students lies in the导师 [tutor, advisor]. The number of tutors and the tutors' concern for graduate students have a decisive impact on graduate student training. The progress of graduate students certainly depends on their own efforts, but also depends on the guidance of their tutors. Tutors should closely care about the progress of graduate students in learning and research, help them obtain the necessary knowledge, and cultivate their ability to think independently; in combination with the research work, they should pay attention to giving play to their creativity and helping them master correct research methods.
    In the past few years, Chinese scientists have made many achievements in building the motherland and cultivating new forces. They are happy to contribute their true talents to the country and pass on their long-term accumulated knowledge and experience to the next generation. With a formal graduate student training system, it will be easier to give play to the role of scientists. The future of science belongs to the younger generation. Scientists should strive to guide more graduate students and train specialized talents for the motherland as much as possible under possible conditions. Of course, under the current conditions of few scientists and scientific institutions in our country and heavy tasks, the work will encounter many difficulties, and this work is relatively unfamiliar to most scientists in our country. However, because the learning method of graduate students is mainly to study on their own under the guidance of tutors; at the same time, the majors they study and research should generally be closely related to the scientific research work that the tutors are engaged in. Therefore, as long as the tutors adopt a positive attitude, they will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and cultivate more scientific talents for the country. The faculties and research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should strengthen their leadership in the training of graduate students, give full play to the strength of scientists, and provide the necessary working conditions to ensure the victory of this major task.

### 积极培养科学研究工作的新生力量

    积极培养科学研究工作的新生力量
    “中国科学院研究生暂行条例”已经国务院批准公布，今年中国科学院决定招收第一批研究生。这是我国正规地培养较高级的科学干部，提高我国科学工作水平，适应社会主义建设的一项重大措施。
    科学的发展对于国家建设具有重要意义，科学干部的培养是决定科学发展的重要因素。过去几年来，我们在开展科学工作、培养科学干部方面已经做了很大的努力，但是一直还没有建立起培养高级的科学干部的正规制度。加以我国科学落后，合乎人民需要的科学工作人才较少，因而我国科学工作的力量仍然是比较薄弱的。随着国民经济有计划建设事业的发展，各方面向科学工作提出的要求日益增多，我们必须尽快地培养大量的科学工作干部，才能够顺利地担负起国家向科学工作提出的巨大任务。
    建国以来，大量的青年加入了科学工作的队伍，他们在实际工作中将逐步提高科学水平，成为熟练的、有理论素养的科学工作者。另外，国家每年派遣很多的留学生去苏联和其它国家学习。这些都是科学干部的重要来源。但是，作为国家培养科学干部的基本形式，应该是建立正规的研究生制度，选拔最优秀的、在科学上最有培养前途的工作人员或高等学校毕业生，在有丰富的科学知识和高度的理论水平的导师的指导下，集中精力学习和进行创造性的研究。这样就可以在比较短的时期内培养出合乎一定标准的较高级的科学干部。现在，我国已进入有计划的、大规模建设时期，科学工作已逐渐走上轨道，许多科学部门的研究工作已逐步地开展起来。在这样的情况下，建立正规的研究生制度，培养较高级的科学干部是完全必要的和有条件的。
    根据中国科学院研究生暂行条例的规定，经过四年的学习，研究生必须具有一定的马克思列宁主义水平、本门科学方面的坚实的基础、有关国家建设方面的实际知识，并能独立进行专业的创造性的科学研究工作。要保证研究生的质量，首先依靠严格入学前的推荐手续和审查考试制度。各科学研究机关，各高等学校，各企业的生产技术部门应该鼓励本部门最优秀、最有培养前途的青年科学技术工作者应考。各部门的优秀的、在科学上有培养前途的在职干部应该是选拔研究生的一个主要来源，各部门对这一工作应当采取积极态度。当然，把最优秀的科学工作干部调出来，是会在一定程度上影响工作，影响当前任务的。但是，为了社会主义建设的长远利益，为了不断地提高我国的科学技术水平，这种暂时的困难是应该努力设法克服的，非如此便不能保证研究生的质量。因为具有一定的实际工作经验的在职干部比一个刚刚毕业的学生具备更好的条件。这些人经过严格的研究生训练，可以很快地成为更通晓专门业务，具有更大的创造能力的成熟的科学工作者，在国家社会主义建设事业中能做出更大的贡献。
    正规的研究生制度的建立首先由中国科学院开始。今年中国科学院也只是在已具备条件的研究机构招收为数不多的研究生。中国科学院的其他研究机构和科学家应当注意为培养研究生准备条件。在中国科学院研究生制度建立以后，有条件的高等学校也应当建立正规的研究生制度；其他的高等学校也应当结合科学研究工作的开展，积极创造这样的条件。高等学校研究生制度的建立可以进一步提高学校的教学质量和科学研究工作的水平。在条件许可的情况下，科学机关的高级研究人员应当指导高等学校的研究生，高等学校的高级教师也应当指导科学机关的研究生，以进一步加强两方面的合作。全国科学研究机构和高等学校的数量六年来有了很大的增长，今后还要继续发展。如果培养研究生的正规制度在全国各科学研究机构、各高等学校逐步建立起来，几年以后就能够陆续为国家培养出大量的较高级的科学干部和师资。我们应该朝着这个方向努力。
    培养研究生的关键在于导师。导师的数量和导师对于研究生的关切，对研究生培养工作有着决定性的意义。研究生的进步当然要靠本人的努力，但也有赖于导师的指导。导师应该密切关怀研究生在学习和研究上的进展，帮助他们获得必需的知识，培养他们独立思考的能力；结合研究工作的进行，应该注意发挥他们的创造性，帮助他们掌握正确的研究方法。
    几年来，我国科学家在建设祖国、培养新生力量方面已经有了不少成绩。他们是乐于把自己的真才实学贡献给国家，把自己长期积累的知识和经验传授给下一代的。在有了正规的培养研究生制度以后，就更便于发挥科学家的作用。科学的将来属于青年一代，科学家们在可能的条件下应该争取多指导研究生，多为祖国培养专门人才。当然，在目前我国科学家和科学机构数量少、任务重的条件下，工作是会遇到不少困难的，而这项工作对于我国多数科学家来说又是比较生疏的。不过，由于研究生的学习方式主要是在导师指导下自己钻研；同时，他们学习、研究的专业一般应该是和导师所从事的科学研究工作有密切关联的。所以只要导师们采取积极的态度，就一定能够克服困难为国家培育更多的科学人才。中国科学院各学部、各研究机构应当加强对研究生培养工作的领导，充分发挥科学家的力量，给予必要的工作条件，以保证这一重大任务的胜利实现。
