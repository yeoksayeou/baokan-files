    We Must Not Allow Backward Units to Remain Backward for Long
    Jia Yujiang
    The leaders of the Third Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province are only satisfied with the overall average production level of the entire mine. They have long neglected to tap the potential of backward units, resulting in a large gap between backward and advanced units, which directly affects the balance of production. In the first half of the year, the Third Mine overproduced raw coal by 1,334 tons, but the recovery was 19,931 tons less than the quota. In July, four coal mining teams overproduced by 2,118 tons, while the other five teams produced 4,795 tons less than the quota. Among the six tunneling groups, only one group completed its task in July, overproducing by 248 tons, while the other five tunneling groups produced 598 tons less than the quota. There is also a large difference in the consumption of main materials between advanced and backward units. In July, most coal mining teams and tunneling groups reduced pit prop consumption, saving 116 cubic meters of pit props, but another group of coal mining teams and tunneling groups exceeded the quota, wasting 120 cubic meters. If these coal mining teams and tunneling groups could also complete the state-stipulated targets, the cost of coal per ton in the Third Mine in July could be reduced by 0.248 yuan due to reduced pit prop consumption alone. The long-term backwardness of production in some working faces has seriously affected the completion of the entire production task. For example, the 314 working face in the Zhangba Coal Pit has continuously produced 9,485 tons less coal from January to July this year, resulting in the entire Zhangba Coal Pit failing to complete its plan for seven months. According to preliminary calculations, if all coal mining teams and tunneling groups in the Third Mine could complete their production tasks for two consecutive months and reach the average advanced production level, they could save 400,000 yuan.
    Instead of patiently organizing the backward coal mining teams and groups to catch up with the advanced coal mining teams and groups, the leaders of the Third Mine ignore where production is backward and only go to where the production tasks are being completed well. In June last year, the leaders and staff of the Zhangba Coal Pit saw that the various indicators of the 309 working face were being completed very well, so they organized a working group to go to the 309 working face to help with the work. However, less than a month later, the working group members felt that "the workers at the 309 working face are not united enough, and the various indicators for the month have not been completed." In July, they abandoned the 309 working face and went to the 312 working face. They said, "The 312 working face is a typical working face for testing metal mesh false roofs for coal mining using double mesh." However, this typical working face soon encountered adverse natural conditions and was often unable to circulate normally. Therefore, the working group hurriedly moved to the 307 working face, which was working better at the time. In this short period of three months, the working group moved three times, each time leaving behind a pile of difficult problems to solve.
    When problems could not be solved, the working group left again. The coal mining team leaders and workers saw that their work had problems and the leadership ignored them, which created negative emotions, and the work naturally became more difficult. The Second Coal Mining Team originally had good indicators and was once the focus of leadership assistance. However, some problems occurred in September last year, and the people helping with the work left. The workers saw that the leadership did not care, and their production morale declined, and they have not been able to complete their tasks in any month since then. The more the tasks are not completed, the more the leaders feel that they are backward, and the less they care about them. One day in early May this year, the Second Coal Mining Team reported to the pithead dispatch station that the roof was changing, the pressure was too high, and there was a risk of a roof collapse. However, the dispatch station only generally instructed "strengthen management" and did not provide any specific assistance. The Second Coal Mining Team and the First Coal Mining Team are in the same Communist Youth League branch, which has a branch secretary who is detached from production. This branch secretary also rarely comes to the Second Team because it is backward.
    The leaders give all kinds of conveniences and care to advanced units in terms of working conditions, but ignore backward units. For example, the N704 working face in the Qichi Coal Pit is completing its tasks well, and material consumption has also been reduced. The leaders give it many favorable conditions. Even though the mining face is only 67 meters long and the roof is good, they still replenish a lot of new pit props every month. The 705 working face has not been able to complete its tasks for a long time, and the leaders rarely care about it. The working face is as long as 95 meters, the roof has serious fragmentation, and not enough new pit props are replenished. The Fifth Tunneling Group has created new records, and the leaders not only regularly send staff to help in the group, but also allow the group to have the best tool allocation and transportation conditions. Even on slopes of only two degrees, mules are allocated to help with transportation. The Second Tunneling Group is considered a backward group by the leaders and receives no assistance. On slopes of eight degrees, they still have to push carts manually. Therefore, the slightly more backward coal mining teams and tunneling groups are very angry. They say, "Same workers, different treatment, what's the point of working hard!"
    Although the leaders of the Third Mine pay attention to the work of advanced units, they have not summarized and promoted advanced experiences well. Liang Sanniu, vice chairman of the mine trade union, said, "Some experiences have been summarized, but they are just reported to the higher authorities, and that's it." In fact, that is indeed the case. In December last year, the mine summarized the "bottom groove, eight eyes in a row" drilling experience of the First Tunneling Group, but only sent a report to the higher-level trade union and did no further work. The 309 working face used a winch to retract the entire length, and also gained a lot of experience, but it was not summarized. The failure to summarize and promote advanced experiences well, coupled with the wrong attitude towards backward links, has made it impossible for backward units to transform for a long time.
    Regarding the huge gap between advanced and backward units, the leaders of the Third Mine have now begun to pay attention, but they have only analyzed the main indicators of the entire mine. As for why backward units have not been able to catch up with advanced units for a long time, they have not fundamentally sought the reasons, let alone taken concrete measures to change this situation.

### 不能让落后单位长期落后

    不能让落后单位长期落后
    贾玉江
    山西阳泉矿务局第三矿的领导人员只满足于全矿生产水平的总平均数，长期不重视发掘落后单位的潜在力量，使得落后单位和先进单位之间的差额很大，直接影响生产的均衡性。上半年第三矿共超产原煤一千三百三十四吨，回采却比定额少产了一万九千九百三十一吨。七月份有四个采煤队超产了二千一百一十八吨，而另外五个队却比定额少产了四千七百九十五吨。六个掘进组，七月份除一个组完成任务，超产了二百四十八吨外，其他五个掘进组比定额少产了五百九十八吨。先进单位和落后单位的主要材料消耗量也相差很大。七月份，大部分采煤队和掘进组降低了坑木消耗，节约了一百一十六立方公尺坑木，但另一部分采煤队和掘进组却超过定额，浪费了一百二十立方公尺。如果这些采煤队和掘进组也能完成国家规定的指标，那末三矿七月份每吨煤炭的成本仅由于坑木消耗减少就可以降低零点二四八元。有些工作面因为生产长期落后，已严重影响整个生产任务的完成。如丈八煤坑的三一四工作面，今年一至七月份连续少产九千四百八十五吨煤，以致整个丈八煤坑七个月不能完成计划。根据初步的材料计算，第三矿所有采煤队和掘进组如果连续两个月都能完成生产任务，并达到平均先进的生产水平，就可以节约四十万元。
    第三矿的领导人员不是耐心地组织落后的采煤队、组，赶上先进的采煤队、组；而是那里生产落后就抛开不管，那里生产任务完成得好，就到那里去。去年六月，丈八煤坑的领导工作人员看到三○九工作面的各项指标都完成得很好，就组织工作组到三○九工作面去帮助工作。但没过一个月，工作组的人员觉得：“三○九工作面的工人太不团结，当月的各项指标都没有完成。”七月份就抛开三○九工作面，到三一二工作面去了。他们说：“三一二工作面是试验金属网假顶采煤铺双网的工作面，很典型。”但这个典型的工作面，不久就遇上了恶劣的自然条件，经常不能正规循环，于是工作组又急急忙忙搬到当时工作较好的三○七工作面去。这样短短的三个月时间，工作组就搬了三次家，每一次都留下一堆难以解决的问题。
    问题不能解决，工作组又走了。采煤队长和工人看见自己工作发生了问题，领导上就抛开不管，便产生了消极情绪，工作自然就更难搞好了。第二采煤队原来指标完成得不错，也曾是领导上帮助的重点；但去年九月发生了一些问题，帮助工作的人就走了，工人们看见领导上不管了，生产情绪也就低沉下来，直到现在没有一个月能够完成任务。任务越完不成，领导人员越觉得他们落后，就越不过问了。今年五月初有一天，第二采煤队因顶板变化，压力太大，有发生冒顶事故的危险。队长随即向坑口调度站汇报，但调度站只一般地指示“加强管理”，没有给任何具体的帮助。第二采煤队和第一采煤队是一个青年团支部，有一个脱离生产的支部书记。这个支部书记也因为二队落后，很少到二队来。
    领导人员对先进的单位在工作条件上给以种种方便和照顾，对落后的单位则不加理睬。如七尺煤坑的南七○四工作面，任务完成得好，材料消耗也有降低，领导人员就给以许多优裕的条件，尽管采长只有六十七公尺，顶板也好，每月还都给补充很多的新坑木。七○五工作面长期完不成任务，领导人员就很少照顾，工作面长达九十五公尺，顶板有严重的破碎现象，也不给补充足够的新坑木。掘进五组创造过新纪录，领导人员不仅经常派工作人员在组里帮助，还让这个组得到最好的工具配备和运输条件；甚至在仅有二度的坡度，也拨了骡子来帮助运输。掘进二组被领导人员认为是个落后组，就得不到任何帮助，八度的坡度，仍然是人力推车。因此落后一点的采煤队和掘进组都很气愤，他们说：“一样工人，两样待遇，还有什么劲头干活呀！”
    第三矿的领导人员虽然注意做先进单位的工作，但对先进的经验并没有很好地总结、推广。矿工会副主席梁三牛说：“有些经验也总结过，都是往上一报，就算完事。”事实上也确是这样。去年十二月，矿上总结了掘进一组“底拉槽，八眼一茬齐”的打眼经验，只往上级工会送了一份报告，再没有做任何工作。三零九工作面使用回柱绞车机回全长，也取得不少经验，但没有总结。先进经验没有很好地总结、推广，加上人们对落后环节又持有错误的态度，就使得落后单位长期不能转变。
    对于先进和落后之间的巨大差额，第三矿的领导人员现在虽已开始注意，但只是把全矿的主要指标分析了一下；至于落后单位为什么长期赶不上先进，还没有从根本上找寻原因，更没有采取具体的措施来改变这种状况。
