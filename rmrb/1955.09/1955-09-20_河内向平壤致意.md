    Hanoi Salutes Pyongyang
    By Our Correspondent in Vietnam, Zhan Chao
    The Korean People's Delegation and Art Troupe, after more than a month of visiting and performing, left Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, by train on the 16th of this month, carrying the deep affection of the Vietnamese people, and returned to Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    Korea and Vietnam, these two heroic countries, have such similar pasts, presents, and futures! Common struggles and fighting friendship have tightly united the Korean and Vietnamese peoples. Although they are thousands of kilometers apart and speak different languages, they are so close and so easy to understand each other. When the Korean People's Delegation and Art Troupe were visiting and performing in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, thousands of people came to greet them and watch their performances wherever they went. Everywhere, the Vietnamese people were heard saying a short sentence full of deep affection: "Our friends have come!"
    To welcome their friends, many elderly people braved the hot sun and rainstorms to come from places hundreds of kilometers away; many people also specially gave portraits of Marshal Kim Il-sung and President Ho Chi Minh, which they had carved with charcoal, to their beloved friends; farmers brought sweet potatoes thicker than bowls and pumpkins weighing fifteen kilograms to give to the Korean People's Delegation and Art Troupe; children gave the carefully woven chicken coops to the envoys of the Korean people, asking them to take them to the Korean children, encouraging each other to work hard for reconstruction and the reunification of the motherland.
    People will never forget the kind and moving scene at the farewell banquet in the Presidential Palace in Hanoi on the evening of the 15th. President Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, personally awarded the First Class Labor Medal to the envoys of the Korean people. President Ho Chi Minh also entrusted the Korean People's Delegation and Art Troupe with a precious gift to take back to Marshal Kim Il-sung. Among the gifts given by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army to the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army were two particularly historically significant gifts: one was a special gun with a 40 cm caliber, which was manufactured by the Vietnamese People's Army Arsenal during the War of Resistance. This gun participated in the battle to annihilate the French invading army's 100th Battalion in the winter-spring campaign in early 1954. The French invaders had named this battalion the "Korean Battalion," which was transferred to Vietnam after participating in the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea. The other was a US-made submachine gun, which was the first trophy of the Dien Bien Phu campaign. Now, the Vietnamese people's army is giving these two historically significant souvenirs to the Korean people's army to commemorate the fighting friendship between the Vietnamese and Korean peoples and to express their determination to jointly defend peace.
    President Ho Chi Minh said: "In the war against aggression, our Korean and Vietnamese peoples have defeated US imperialism and French colonialists; in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of our motherlands, the peoples of our two countries will surely win, and US imperialism and its running dogs will surely fail." President Ho Chi Minh said: "Comrades, you have brought the great fraternal friendship of the Korean people to our Vietnamese people; now, please take back to the Korean people, to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the Korean Workers' Party, and to the leader of the Korean people, Comrade Kim Il-sung, the warm fraternal friendship of our Vietnamese people. The just cause of our two peoples will surely triumph."
    This is the heroic Vietnamese people saluting the heroic Korean people. This is glorious Hanoi saluting glorious Pyongyang.

    河内向平壤致意
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    朝鲜人民代表团和艺术团，经过一个多月的访问演出，于本月十六日带着越南人民的深情厚意，坐火车离开越南民主共和国首都河内，回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首都平壤去了。
    朝鲜和越南，这两个英雄的国度，它们有着多么相彷的过去、现在和未来啊！共同的斗争，战斗的友谊，把朝鲜人民和越南人民紧紧地团结在一起。他们虽然是相隔几千公里，虽然操着不同的语言，但是他们却这样地接近，这样地容易互相了解。当朝鲜人民代表团和艺术团在越南民主共和国进行访问演出的时候，每到一处，都有成千上万的人来迎接他们和看他们的演出。到处听到越南人民说着一句包含着无限深情厚意的简短的话：“我们的朋友来了！”
    为了迎接自己的朋友，许多老年人冒着炎热的太阳和暴风骤雨，从上百公里以外的地方赶来；许多人还特意把自己用炭精刻的金日成元帅和胡志明主席像送给亲爱的友人；农民们把自己种的比碗口还粗的红薯、十五公斤重的南瓜等带来，送给朝鲜人民代表团和艺术团；孩子们把自己精心编织的鸡笼，交给朝鲜人民的使者，请他们带给朝鲜的小朋友们，互相勉励要为恢复建设工作和争取祖国的统一而努力。
    人们永远忘记不了十五日晚上在河内主席府里临别宴会上的那种亲切动人的情景。胡志明主席代表越南民主共和国政府，亲自把一等劳动勋章授予朝鲜人民使者们。胡志明主席还把一份珍贵的礼物托付朝鲜人民代表团和艺术团带回给金日成元帅。在越南人民军总司令部送给朝鲜人民军总司令部的礼品中，有两件特别富有历史意义的礼物：一件是一枝四十糎口径的特种枪，这是越南人民军兵工厂在抗战时期制造的，这枝枪曾经在一九五四年年初的冬春战役中参加消灭法国侵略军第一○○营的战斗。法国侵略者曾把这个营命名为“朝鲜营”，它是在参与美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争后调到越南来的。另一件是一枝美制冲锋枪，是奠边府战役中的第一件战利品。现在，越南人民的军队把这两件有历史意义的纪念品送给朝鲜人民的军队，以纪念越南人民和朝鲜人民的战斗的友谊，表示共同保卫和平的决心。
    胡志明主席说：“在反侵略战争中，我们朝鲜人民和越南人民已经战胜了美帝国主义和法国殖民者；在争取祖国的和平统一斗争中，我们两国人民一定胜利，美帝国主义和它的走狗一定失败。”胡志明主席说：“同志们，你们把朝鲜人民伟大的兄弟的友谊带来给我们越南人民；现在，请你们带着我们越南人民热烈的兄弟的友情回去给朝鲜人民、给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、给朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民的领袖金日成同志。我们两国人民的正义事业必定胜利。”
    这是英雄的越南人民在向英雄的朝鲜人民致意。这是光荣的河内在向光荣的平壤致意。
                      九月十六日，河内
