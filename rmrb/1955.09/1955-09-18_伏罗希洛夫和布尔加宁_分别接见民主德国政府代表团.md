    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 17th. TASS Moscow, September 17th reported: The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, received Grotewohl, the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, and the members of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, Vice Premiers Ulbricht, Nuschke, and Bolz, in the Kremlin on September 17th.
    Present at the reception were Begov, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Semenov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, and Pushkin, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the USSR to the German Democratic Republic.
    During the reception, Voroshilov had a friendly and warm conversation with Grotewohl and the members of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 17th. TASS Moscow, September 17th reported: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, received Grotewohl, the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, and the members of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic: Vice Premiers Ulbricht, Nuschke, and Bolz on September 17th.
    Present at the reception were Semenov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, and Pushkin, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the USSR to the German Democratic Republic.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 17th. TASS Berlin, September 16th reported: "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on the arrival of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic in Moscow to continue negotiations with the Soviet Government that began in Berlin in July of this year, stating that particularly important issues will be discussed in these negotiations. The members of the government delegation themselves have already indicated this. The two governments will jointly discuss further measures to safeguard peace, establish a European collective security system, and expand economic and scientific ties between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.
    The editorial said that Western newspapers are paying particular attention to the continuation of these negotiations precisely when Adenauer has just returned from Moscow. This attention is entirely understandable. Adenauer's propaganda machine is attempting to portray the situation as if the West German delegation was negotiating in Moscow on behalf of the entire Germany. However, the trip of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic to Moscow once again demonstrates that no issue concerning the entire Germany can be resolved without the participation of the German Democratic Republic.
    The editorial went on to point out that the signing of the Paris Agreements is the most significant obstacle on the road to the reunification of Germany. The editorial emphasized that Germany can be reunited into a unified and democratic country, a country without warmongers and militarists. This is a complex, arduous task that will take a long time to resolve. However, this issue can be resolved if the two Germanies gradually approach each other and achieve mutual understanding.
    The editorial stressed that the German Democratic Republic is making every effort to resolve this important national issue. (Attached picture)

    伏罗希洛夫和布尔加宁
    分别接见民主德国政府代表团
    新华社十七日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫十七日在克里姆林宫接见了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和德意志民主共和国政府代表团团员、副总理乌布利希、努舍克和博尔茨。
    接见时在座的有苏联最高苏维埃主席团秘书别哥夫、苏联外交部副部长谢苗诺夫和苏联驻德意志民主共和国特命全权大使普希金。
    接见时，伏罗希洛夫同格罗提渥和德意志民主共和国政府代表团团员作了友好热烈的交谈。
    新华社十七日讯  塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁十七日接见了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和德意志民主共和国政府代表团团员：副总理乌布利希、努舍克和博尔茨。
    接见时在座的有苏联外交部副部长谢苗诺夫和苏联驻德意志民主共和国特命全权大使普希金。
    新华社十七日讯  据塔斯社柏林十六日讯：“新德意志报”就德意志民主共和国政府代表团到达莫斯科同苏联政府继续进行在今年七月间在柏林开始的谈判一事发表社论说：在这次谈判中将讨论特别重大的问题。政府代表团成员本身已经说明了这一点。两国政府将共同讨论在保障和平、建立欧洲集体安全体系以及扩大苏联和德意志民主共和国两国之间的经济和科学联系等方面的进一步措施。
    社论说，西方报纸特别注意这次谈判恰好是在阿登纳刚从莫斯科回来的时候继续进行的。这种注意是完全可以理解的。阿登纳的宣传机关企图把事情说成是，似乎西德代表团是代表整个德国在莫斯科举行谈判的。但是，德意志民主共和国政府代表团的莫斯科之行再次说明，没有德意志民主共和国的参加，任何一个有关整个德国的问题都是不可能解决的。
    社论接着指出，巴黎协定的签订是重新统一德国的道路上的最主要的障碍。社论强调说，德意志可以重新统一成为一个统一的和民主的国家，一个没有战争挑拨者和军国主义者的国家。这是一个复杂的、艰巨的和需要很多时间才能解决的任务。但是，如果两个德国将逐渐接近起来和取得相互谅解，这个问题是可以解决的。
    社论着重指出，德意志民主共和国正在全力设法解决这一重大的全民族的问题。（附图片）
