    Friend
    Soviet Union, M. Sukhanov
    Ivan Monakhov will soon be parting with his young friend. This old worker from Moscow worriedly thinks of the moment when those seeing him off will have to leave the Moscow-Beijing train carriage. One last hurried embrace, and he will return to the bustling platform of Moscow Station. The excited face of the young worker Le Minqiang from distant Shanghai, shines before his eyes through the train window.

    At the same time, the old Moscow worker thinks with pleasure that his student will be working in a Chinese factory, and his experience and knowledge will help Chinese comrades manufacture their own cars.

    We are sitting in the workshop of the adjusting section [1] of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory. Le Minqiang pushes aside his notebook, in which he had been writing something, and listens attentively to Monakhov's words. Through the closed doors comes the rumbling of machine tools and the clanging of parts. Parts made by the skilled hands of workers flow into the general assembly line [2], where they are used to assemble powerful and robust automobiles.

    Ivan Monakhov has worked in this automobile factory for more than twenty-five years, almost half his life. During this period, he has accumulated rich experience and thoroughly studied all the characteristics of grinding machines [3] and the mysteries of grinding work. He can almost unerringly determine the cause of a machine's malfunction simply by listening to the sound it makes, and he can quickly adjust it. As the foreman of the grinding machine adjustment section, he enjoys great prestige in the workshop and the factory.

    It can be said that Monakhov has been engaged in this work since the early days of the Soviet automobile industry. He deeply understands Le Minqiang and his comrades' thirst for knowledge, and their unstoppable and tenacious desire to master the "tricks" of production.

    "When the first Chinese-made car rolls off the assembly line, that will also be our holiday," Ivan Monakhov said. "We are trying our best to help our friends so that this day will come sooner."

    "By the way," he asked, "have you noticed the photo exhibition window in the Technical Education Section about the construction project of the China First Automobile Works? Le Minqiang will be working in this factory in the future."

    Almost a year ago, Le Minqiang came from Shanghai to this automobile factory in Moscow, built by the Soviets after the revolution. Although the Shanghai worker was not unfamiliar with production, the scale of the factory surprised him.

    "At first, I was even a little scared," Le Minqiang recalled. "My teacher, Comrade Monakhov, helped me quickly get familiar with the new environment. He patiently explained everything I didn't understand. Of course, many other comrades also helped me."

    "Anyone would be happy to help someone like him," said Seni Temshikin, the director of the adjusting section, interjecting. "He is very capable and learns almost everything at first try. He has a strong desire for knowledge and wants to know everything. He is even interested in things that are not directly related to his line of work..."

    Seeing my doubtful look, Temshikin explained, "For example, an adjusting foreman doesn't necessarily need to understand the electrical equipment of the machine tool, but he wants to know this too. Strangely enough, he only went to school for three years, and yet he not only has practical experience, but also has mastered the theory of grinding work. Our engineers who teach theory highly praise him."

    I smiled.

    "What, don't you believe it? Do you think it's an overstatement?"

    "No," I replied, "it's because whenever I talk to anyone about the Chinese comrades who are interning in your factory, everyone says that they are hardworking and eager to learn. The deputy director of the technical department, Yefim Leiches, has talked to me about the many advantages of engineer Zhao Qian, who is studying the processing technology of gearbox [4] parts. Comrades' comments on engineer Fan Hengguang, who is studying production organization, and many other Chinese comrades are very good. In the Technical Education Section, they told me that they have never found any Chinese comrade who doesn't study well."

    Monakhov said slowly, "Yes, there is no need to say that they are capable people and very fond of labor. For example, let's talk about Le Minqiang, who I taught. In one year, he has learned so much that he has now become a real foreman. When it comes to adjusting machine tools, the workers in our workshop even come to ask him for advice. They know that he does this work quickly and well."

    Before this, Le Minqiang had been listening to our conversation in silence. Now, he suddenly became excited, pushed his blue cap to the back of his head, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and struggled to pronounce each word, firmly declaring:

    "I am not a foreman, I am still just an adjuster. In order to become a foreman like you, I still need to work and study for a lot of time..."

    "Oh, oh, you don't have to be modest," Temshikin smiled. "I already know that you know no less than other foremen. As for continuing to study and improve your skills, that is of course necessary. We are still learning, learning from each other. It is not good to stay in one place." Temshikin paused, thought for a moment, and added calmly, as if in discussion, "A very modest person. Modest, hardworking, and strong."

    Le Minqiang moved his hand awkwardly, and the notebook that he had been writing in when we came to the workshop almost fell off the table. I grabbed it. The notebook opened, and I saw notes written in Russian.

    Monakhov said, "Look, this is another proof of Le Minqiang's hard work and strength. We have already told you that he only studied Russian for six months in China. You know, this time is very short. However, during his year in our country, he has not only spoken Russian well, but can also write..."

    At this time, three Chinese youths wearing work clothes and blue caps walked into the workshop.

    Temshikin said, "Let me introduce you, these are newcomers. They came from China a month ago."

    We began to talk. The three came from Changchun, Tianjin, and Fushun respectively. They were all workers who had come to Moscow to learn new knowledge. One of them will study broaching machines [5], diamond boring machines [6], and thread lathes [7]. Another will study grinding work, and the third will study the technical inspection work of the chassis and rear axle workshop [8].

    "One of them is my new student," Monakhov said.

    "How about it, have you looked at Moscow and the factory?"

    The Chinese youths helped each other to talk about how they had been to Red Square, Lenin Hills, and the various parks in Moscow, walked on the bustling streets and squares, looked at the factory, and been to various workshops.

    Le Minqiang listened to the words of his compatriots, smiling knowingly. When he came to Moscow, he immediately went to Red Square, Lenin Hills, and from its heights, he viewed the broad panorama of the big city, with the picturesque outlines of the Kremlin's ancient bell tower, the new tall buildings, and the factory chimneys, and the dense green of the clusters of parks... What was especially long and unforgettable for him was the pleasant and solemn parade. He had participated in the parades on Red Square with the workers of the automobile factory on May Day and the October Revolution Day. But are the theaters, cinemas, and parks of Moscow easy to forget? He had also been a guest in the homes of Soviet friends.

    Le Minqiang recalled, "In May, I was a guest at my teacher Comrade Monakhov's home. His small house was very comfortable. His wife prepared some delicious food for us. This was so pleasant!"

    "Le Minqiang, why don't you say anything about us playing 'Moscow-Beijing' and 'Three Tankers' together?" Monakhov asked, and then explained, "You know, I can play the accordion, and he can play the harmonica. Our ensemble is not bad..."

    As I thanked the comrades for their conversation and prepared to leave, Monakhov said thoughtfully, "I have become accustomed to being with him. He is already like my child. Perhaps this is because I don't have any children? I can't even figure it out myself, but I am reluctant to part with him..."

    Le Minqiang learned the rich experience of the Soviet workers and fully studied what was new to him. He is about to return to his motherland. There, his family is waiting for him, and a lot of work is waiting for him to complete. Like his teacher, the old worker from Moscow, he faces the task of laying the foundation for and developing the automobile industry in his motherland.

    Soon, the friends will part. What Le Minqiang will take away is not only the accumulated production experience and technical knowledge, but also the memory of the city, the people of the city, the factory, and his comrades in work and dormitory. He will also take away the warmth of that sincere friendship.

    When Ivan Monakhov comes to the factory the day after sending Le Minqiang back to his country, what awaits him, in addition to the familiar work, will be a new student—Xu Hongkai, a young worker from Tianjin. Of course, this can help Monakhov restrain his feelings of parting with his friend. Friends can be separated, but true friendship will not disappear after separation.

    朋友
    苏联  姆·苏哈诺夫
    伊万·莫纳霍夫很快就要同他的年轻朋友分别了。这位莫斯科的老工人忧愁地想到请送行的人离开莫斯科—北京列车车厢的那一刻。还有一次匆匆的临别的拥抱，他就要回到莫斯科车站熙熙攘攘的月台上来了。车窗中来自遥远的上海的青年工人乐民强的激动的脸，在他的眼前闪耀。
    同时，这位莫斯科的老工人愉快地想到，他的学生将在中国工厂工作，他的经验和知识将会帮助中国同志制造自己的汽车。
    我们坐在莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的调整工段〔一〕的厂房里。乐民强把他记下了一些什么的笔记本推到一边去，注意地听着莫纳霍夫的话。透过了关闭着的门传来了机床的隆隆声和零件的锵锵声。工人们的有经验的手制成的零件流入总装配线〔二〕，就在这里用这些零件装配成马力大的坚固的汽车。
    伊万·莫纳霍夫在这个汽车厂已工作了二十五年以上，几乎是半辈子了。在这段期间，他积累了丰富的经验，透彻地研究了磨床〔三〕的一切特点和研磨工作的奥妙。他只要一听声音几乎就能毫无错误地确定机床工作发生毛病的原因，而且能够迅速地把它调整好。作为磨床调整工长的他，在车间和工厂里享有极大的威望。
    可以说，莫纳霍夫从苏联汽车制造业建立的初期，就从事这项工作。他非常理解乐民强和他的同志们的求知的热望，理解他们的如何能够更好地掌握生产“窍门”这一不可遏止的顽强的愿望。
    “当第一辆中国自造的汽车离开装配线的时候，这也将是我们的节日。”伊万·莫纳霍夫说：“我们尽力想办法帮助我们的朋友，为的是让这一天更快地来到。”
    “请问，”他问道，“你们没有注意到技术教育科里的那个中国第一汽车厂建筑工程的照片展览窗吗？乐民强将来就在这个工厂里工作。”
    差不多是一年以前，乐民强从上海来到莫斯科的这座革命后由苏联人建造的汽车厂里来。虽然这位上海工人对生产并不生疏，但是工厂的规模却使他惊奇。
    “起初甚至有些害怕，”乐民强回忆说：“我的这位老师，莫纳霍夫同志，帮助我很快地熟悉了新的环境。他耐心地向我解释一切我所不明白的事。当然其他许多同志也都帮助过我。”
    “谁也会高兴帮助这种人的，”调整工段主任谢尼·捷姆希金插进来说：“他很能干，对一切几乎是一学就会。他的求知欲很强，想知道一切事情，他甚至对同他那一行没有直接关系的事都感到兴趣……”
    捷姆希金看到我的怀疑的目光后，就解释说：“比如，调整工长并不必要了解机床的电气装置，而他也想知道这个。奇怪的是：他只上过三年学，你瞧，他不仅有实际经验，而且也掌握了研磨工作的理论。我们的教理论的工程师都非常称赞他。”
    我微笑了一下。
    “怎么，不相信吗？认为赞誉得过分了吗？”
    “不是，”我回答说，“这是因为我无论同谁谈到那些在你们工厂实习的中国同志，大家都说他们是勤劳和刻苦学习的人。技术部的副主任叶菲姆·列依切斯同我谈起过关于研究排档变速箱〔四〕零件加工工艺的赵?千工程师的很多优点。同志们对于研究生产组织的范恒光工程师和其他许多中国同志的评论都是很好的。在技术教育科里，他们告诉我说，他们还从未发现哪位中国同志学得不好。”
    莫纳霍夫慢慢地说：“是的，不用说，他们是一些能干的人，并且是非常热爱劳动的人。比如，就说我所教的这位乐民强吧。一年中他就学会了那么多东西，现在已成为一位真正的工长了。当要调整机床的时候，我们车间的工人甚至都来请教他了。他们知道，他做这件工作既快又好。”
    在这以前，乐民强沉默地听着我们谈话，现在突然兴奋起来，把他的蓝色小帽推向后脑勺，擦着汗淋淋的前额，吃力地吐出每个字，坚决地声明说：
    “我不是工长，我还只是一个调整工。为了成为像你这样的工长，我还应当工作和学习很多时间……。”
    “噢，噢，你不必谦虚了，”捷姆希金微笑了，“我早已知道，你懂得的并不比别的工长少。至于继续学习和提高自己的技术，这当然是需要的。我们也仍在学习，互相学习。停在一个地方是不行的。”捷姆希金敛住笑容沉思了一下，好像讨论似的沉着地补充说，“非常谦虚的一个人。谦虚、勤劳、坚强。”
    乐民强局促地动了一下手，于是那本在我们到车间来的时候他曾记入了些什么的笔记本差一点从桌子上掉下来。我抓住了它。本子打开了，我看到了用俄文写的笔记。
    莫纳霍夫说：“你看，这是乐民强勤劳和坚强的又一个证据。我们已经告诉过你，他在国内只学过六个月的俄文。你要知道，这时间是很短的。但是，在他来到我国的一年期间，他不仅俄文已说得很好，而且也能写了……。”
    这时，三个穿着工作服、戴着蓝色便帽的中国青年走进了车间。
    捷姆希金说：“让我来介绍一下，这是新来的人。他们是在一个月以前从中国来的。”
    我们开始谈起来了。这三个人一个来自长春，一个来自天津，一个来自抚顺，他们全都是工人，到莫斯科来是为了学习新的知识。其中一个人将研究拉床〔五〕、金钢石搪床〔六〕和螺纹车床〔七〕，另一个人学习研磨工作，第三个人学习底盘和后桥车间〔八〕的技术检查工作。
  　“这里边有一个是我的新学生，”莫纳霍夫说。
    “怎么样，你们是不是已经看了一下莫斯科，看了一下工厂了？”
    中国的青年人互相帮着开始谈到，他们已经到过红场，到过列宁山和莫斯科的各公园，在热闹的大街和广场上散过步，看了一下工厂，到过各个车间。
    乐民强听着他的同胞的话，会意地微笑着。当他来到莫斯科的时候，也是立刻就去到红场，到列宁山，并从它的高处来观赏这个大城市广阔的全景，那有着克里姆林宫古老的钟楼、新的高大建筑物和工厂烟囱的清晰如画的轮廓、有着一团团的公园的浓绿的全景……。使他特别长久难忘的是愉快而庄严的游行。在五一节和十月革命节他曾同汽车厂的工人们一道参加了红场上的游行。可是，莫斯科的剧院、电影院、公园难道容易忘怀吗？他也到苏联朋友家中做过客。
    乐民强回忆说，“五月里，我曾到我的老师莫纳霍夫同志家做过客。他的小住宅非常舒适。他妻子为我们准备了一些美味的食品。这是多令人愉快啊！”
    “乐民强，你怎么不说我们一块儿奏‘莫斯科—北京’和‘三个坦克手’的事呢？”莫纳霍夫问，随即解释说：“你们知道，我会拉手风琴，他会吹口琴。我们的合奏还不错哩……”
    当我对同志们的谈话表示谢意并预备告辞的时候，莫纳霍夫沉思地说道：“我同他在一起已经习惯了。他已经像是我的孩子。这也许是因为我没有孩子的缘故？我自己也弄不清为什么，但是我舍不得同他分别……”
    乐民强学习到苏联工人的丰富经验，充分研究了对他说来是新的事物。他将要回到自己的祖国。那里有他的家庭在等待着他，有许多的工作在期待着他去完成。他同他的老师——莫斯科的老工人从前的情况一样，面临的任务是要为祖国的汽车制造业奠定基础并加以发展。
    不久以后，朋友们就要分别了。乐民强所要带走的不仅有积累起来的生产经验和技术知识，他带走的还有对城市、这个城市的人、工厂和他在工作中、宿舍中的同志的怀念。他将带走的还有那真诚友情的温暖。
    等到伊万·莫纳霍夫送乐民强回国后的第二天来到工厂时，等待着他的除开熟悉的工作外将还有一个新学生——从天津来的青年工人许鸿凯。当然，这可以帮助莫纳霍夫克制同朋友离别之情。朋友是能离别的，但真正的友情在分别后不会消失。
