More than 85% of the overseas Chinese students studying at the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary School, a total of over two thousand nine hundred, were admitted to universities and secondary schools this summer vacation. Among them, more than one hundred and fifty were admitted to universities, more than two thousand six hundred were admitted to regular middle schools, and one hundred and fifty were admitted to secondary vocational schools. These admitted overseas Chinese students have been assigned to universities, secondary vocational schools, and regular middle schools in more than twenty cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing for study. Relevant departments have also organized them by region and sent special personnel to escort them to school.

Before embarking on their new learning journey, the overseas Chinese students happily expressed their feelings after returning to the country. They all warmly thanked the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the people of the motherland for their care and love; and especially thanked the teachers of the supplementary school for their help, which enabled them to improve both their political and academic levels after returning to the country.

Overseas Chinese students who applied but were not admitted were properly resettled. Some of them remained at the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary School to continue their studies; others were sent to the Beijing Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary School and the Xiamen Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary School to continue their studies, preparing to take the exam again next year. The Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students' Supplementary School is also preparing to open university preparatory classes, secondary technical classes, and supplementary classes for senior high school year one, senior high school year two, and junior high school, to help them with their studies.

    在广州补习的归国华侨学生近三千人考入高等、中等学校
    广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校的学生，今年暑假共有二千九百多名考进了高等学校和中等学校，占在该校补习的归国华侨学生百分之八十五以上。计有一百五十多人考进了高等学校，二千六百多人考进了普通中学，一百五十名考进了中等专业学校。这些被录取的华侨学生，已分配在北京、上海、广州、南京等二十多个城市的高等学校、中等专业学校和普通中学学习。有关部门还按地区，分别把他们组织起来，派专人送他们入学。
    在走上新的学习岗位以前，华侨学生们都愉快地发表了回国后的感想。他们都热烈感谢共产党、人民政府和祖国人民对他们的关怀和爱护；并特别感谢补习学校的老师对他们的帮助，使他们在回国后，不论在政治水平和文化水平上都有了提高。
    投考未被录取的华侨学生都得到妥善的安置。他们当中，有的留在广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校继续补习；有的分送到北京归国华侨学生中等补习学校和厦门的集美归国华侨学生中等补习学校继续补习，准备明年再考。广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校还准备开设大学先修班、中等技术班、高中一、高中二和初中各班等补习班，帮助他们补习。
