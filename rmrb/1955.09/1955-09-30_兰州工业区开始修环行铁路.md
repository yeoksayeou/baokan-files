Construction of Circular Railway Begins in Lanzhou Industrial Zone

    A circular railway specifically for industrial infrastructure construction and industrial production has begun construction in the Lanzhou industrial zone. Workers are working hard on earthwork engineering.
    In the Lanzhou industrial zone, starting next year, several large enterprises, including the Lanzhou Oil Refinery, will successively begin large-scale construction, and a large amount of construction materials and huge, heavy machinery and equipment will be transported here. After the completion of this circular railway, materials from all over the country supporting the industrial construction of Lanzhou and machinery ordered from the Soviet Union can be transferred from the Longhai Railway to the circular railway and transported to the construction site. In the future, after these factories are put into production, the circular railway can transport various raw materials to the factories and transport many industrial products to all parts of the country.
    This circular railway will be more than ten kilometers long after completion, with a large transportation capacity. There are two stations and one locomotive depot along the line. There are also several branch lines from this main line to various factories. Once the freight cars enter the circular railway line, the shunting locomotives of the locomotive depot can easily pull them to various factories. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    兰州工业区开始修环行铁路
    兰州市工业区已经开始修建一条专为工业基本建设和工业生产服务的环行铁路。工人们正在紧张地进行土方工程。
    在兰州市工业区，从明年开始，将有兰州炼油厂等几个大型企业陆续开始大规模的施工，大量的建筑器材和巨大、沉重的机器设备将要运到这里。这条环行铁路建成以后，全国各地支援兰州工业建设的物资和从苏联订购的机器，便可以由陇海铁路转环行铁路运到工地。将来这些工厂投入生产以后，环行铁路又可以把各种原料运到工厂，把许多工业产品运往祖国各地。
    这条环行铁路修成以后有十多公里长，运输能力很大。沿线有两个车站和一个机务段。从这条干线到各个工厂还有好几条支线。货车一走进环行铁路线上，就可以由机务段的调动机车很方便地把它们牵引到各个工厂。　（本报驻兰州记者）
