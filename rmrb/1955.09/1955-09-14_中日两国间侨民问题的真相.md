The statement issued by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association on September 1 regarding the situation of Overseas Chinese in Japan has aroused close attention and importance from the entire Chinese people. This statement refutes the Japanese government's claim that Overseas Chinese in Japan enjoy the same treatment as other foreigners, exposes the truth about the issue of Overseas Chinese between China and Japan, and thus points out the responsibility that the Japanese government should bear in handling the issue of Overseas Chinese in Japan.

The statement by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association indicates that the Japanese government not only frequently infringes upon the personal freedom and legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese in Japan, unreasonably arrests Overseas Chinese and searches their residences, but even interferes with the inherent rights and freedom of Overseas Chinese to love their motherland and choose and support their own government. The statement points out the fact that from the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to 1952, Overseas Chinese in Japan were deprived of their right and freedom to return to their motherland. Until June 1953, although twelve Japanese ships had sailed to China, and 14,550 Japanese nationals in China who were willing to return to Japan had returned to their country, the Japanese government did not provide any convenience for Overseas Chinese to return to their country. This situation continued until March 1955 without fundamental change. The free exchange and contact between Overseas Chinese in Japan and their motherland is subject to various obstacles, and even the remains of deceased relatives of Overseas Chinese are not allowed to be reburied in their hometown. Although the Chinese side has repeatedly assisted Japanese nationals in China in remitting their wages back to Japan to support their families, the necessary remittances from Overseas Chinese to their families in China have not received any facilitation to this day. Compared with the Japanese government's attitude towards expatriates of other countries in Japan, the Japanese government obviously adopts an inappropriate discriminatory attitude towards Overseas Chinese in Japan. This attitude is not conducive to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and should no longer continue to exist.

The Chinese government's attitude towards Japanese nationals in China stands in sharp contrast to the Japanese government's attitude towards Overseas Chinese in Japan. The Chinese government has always protected the legitimate rights and interests of Japanese nationals in China, and never interfered with their thoughts and beliefs, their views on the Japanese political situation, or their attitude towards the Japanese government, whether it is criticism, opposition, or support. The Chinese government has always provided various conveniences for Japanese nationals who wish to return to their country. By the end of March 1955, with the assistance of the Chinese government and through the efforts of non-governmental organizations in China and Japan, approximately 29,000 Japanese nationals who wished to return to Japan had returned to Japan out of a total of approximately 35,000 Japanese nationals. They are the best witnesses to the Chinese government's open and aboveboard attitude towards Japanese nationals in China.

As for the more than 6,000 Japanese nationals who are still staying in China, they have expressed their willingness to reside in China for a long time or temporarily. The Chinese government has stated that if any of them apply to return to their country, the Chinese government will still provide various conveniences to enable them to realize their wishes. This was originally a non-issue. Therefore, the Japanese government's claim that the issue of Japanese nationals returning to China is currently facing difficulties, etc., is fundamentally inconsistent with the facts and is a deliberate distortion. In fact, the Red Cross Society of China is continuing to assist Japanese nationals who wish to return to Japan, and the agreement signed by the three Japanese organizations, namely the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council, with the Red Cross Society of China is still valid. Non-governmental organizations in China and Japan have cooperated well in the past and will continue to cooperate well in the future. Therefore, if we are to talk about the "issue of expatriates," as the facts have proven, what needs to be resolved through negotiations between China and Japan is by no means the unilateral so-called "issue of Japanese nationals," but the issue of expatriates on both sides. In other words, the issue of Japanese nationals has already been basically resolved, and what should be mainly discussed now is the issue of Chinese nationals in Japan.

The statement by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association also indicates that the Japanese government has not yet accounted for the whereabouts of a large number of Chinese who were abducted to Japan and enslaved in the past. According to the materials held by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, a total of 38,935 Chinese were abducted to Japan during the Japanese militarists' invasion of China, and 6,830 were killed. It must be pointed out that this is, so far, the figure obtained by Overseas Chinese in Japan through individual investigations in various forms under extremely difficult conditions. This can only be the most conservative statistic and cannot cover the whole picture. For example, the "Akahata" newspaper of Japan reported on January 22, 1950, that according to Shiowaki of the "China Research Institute," which specialized in investigating Chinese prisoners of war and laborers during the war, approximately 160,000 to 170,000 Chinese prisoners of war were abducted to Japan during the war.

As the statement by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association pointed out, the Japanese government not only refuses to account for the whereabouts of this large number of Chinese who were abducted to Japan during its war of aggression against China, but also obstructs the investigation of their situation. The mass massacre in the Hanaoka mine in northern Honshu, Japan, where more than 400 Chinese prisoners of war and workers were tortured and killed, which was not revealed until 1950, is a clear example. This massacre was first revealed by the "Overseas Chinese People's Daily," the organ of the Democratic Promotion Association of Overseas Chinese in Japan, on January 11, 1950. This Overseas Chinese newspaper subsequently revealed that similar massacres had occurred in the Heiwa mine in Hokkaido, the Funakawa, Asakawa Okuno, and Sego of Akita Prefecture, and the Yosano Village of Yosano County in Kyoto Prefecture. In February 1950, the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association requested the Japanese government to handle the remains of the Hanaoka massacre and thoroughly investigate the murderers. However, the Japanese government not only ignored it completely, but also closed down the "Overseas Chinese People's Daily" on September 28, 1950. Later, it was the Overseas Chinese Association that collected these remains with the assistance of Japanese non-governmental organizations such as the Japan-China Friendship Association and sent them back to the motherland. As for the massacres that occurred in other places, the Japanese government has not shown any signs of wanting to conduct any investigation to this day.

Obviously, the Japanese government has the responsibility to immediately conduct a thorough investigation of all these massacres and provide the Chinese people with a responsible account of the whereabouts of the thousands upon thousands of abducted Chinese. However, the Japanese government completely avoids talking about this, and instead groundlessly demands that the Chinese government discuss the completely fictitious issue of 40,000 Japanese who are "unaccounted for" in the Japanese war of aggression against China. It seems that it is not the Japanese government but the Chinese government that should be responsible for these Japanese who were driven to carry out the war of aggression, which cannot but be said to be extremely absurd. The Japanese government's raising of such provocative and unwarranted issues at a time when the Japanese people are universally demanding the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, and making the resolution of such issues a prerequisite for the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, is of dubious motives.

It is entirely understandable that Overseas Chinese in Japan welcome the strengthening of friendly relations between China and Japan, support the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on August 16, and feel indignant at the Japanese government's absurd attitude. Because not only Overseas Chinese feel this way, but also people of justice in Japan universally feel this way. The statement issued by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association once again powerfully confirms the iron-clad facts stated in the statement of our Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on August 16. If the Japanese government has even a shred of sincerity in its repeated statements about "improving Sino-Japanese relations," it should immediately correct its incorrect attitude on the issue of expatriates between China and Japan, so as to solve many major issues related to the interests of the people of China and Japan in a realistic manner from the perspective of the interests of the Japanese people. The Chinese government has expressed its readiness to negotiate these issues with the Japanese government. Now is the time to test whether the Japanese government is sincere in seeking the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

### 中日两国间侨民问题的真相

    中日两国间侨民问题的真相
    东京华侨总会在九月一日就在日华侨的处境所发表的声明，引起了全中国人民的密切注意和重视。这个声明驳斥了日本政府所宣传的所谓在日华侨享有同其他外侨同样待遇的说法，揭露了中日两国间侨民问题的真相，从而指出了日本政府在处理在日华侨问题上应负的责任。
    东京华侨总会的声明表明：日本政府不但经常侵犯在日华侨的人身自由和正当权益，无理地逮捕华侨和搜查华侨的住宅，甚至干涉华侨爱护自己祖国、选择并支持自己政府的固有权利和自由。声明指出了这样的事实：从一九四九年中华人民共和国成立起到一九五二年，在日华侨竟被剥夺了返回祖国的权利和自由。直到一九五三年六月，尽管已有十二艘次的日本船只航行中国，并有一万四千五百五十名愿意返回日本的在华日侨回国，但日本政府对华侨回国，却并没给予任何便利。这种情况一直拖延到一九五五年三月并没有基本上的改变。在日华侨和祖国的自由往来和联系受到各种阻挠，甚至华侨亲属死后的遗体也不准迁葬还乡。尽管中国方面曾多次协助在华日侨将其工薪汇回日本作家属瞻养，但华侨对在中国的家属所必要的瞻养汇款至今没有得到任何便利。同日本政府对其他国家在日本的侨民的态度比较起来，日本政府对在日华侨显然采取了不应有的歧视的态度。这种态度是不利于中日关系正常化的，因此再也不应该继续存在下去。
    中国政府对于在华日侨的态度，和日本政府对于在日华侨的态度形成了强烈的对照。中国政府一向保护在华日侨的合法权益和正当权利，并且对他们的思想信仰和他们对日本政局的看法与对日本政府的态度，不论是批评、反对或支持，从不加以干涉。对于愿意回国的日侨，中国政府一向给予各种便利。到一九五五年三月底为止，在中国政府协助下，经过中日两国民间团体的努力，在总数三万五千名左右的日侨中，已经有大约二万九千名愿意回国的日侨返回日本。他们都是中国政府对在华日侨所采取的光明磊落的态度的最好的见证人。
    至于那些现在仍然留在中国的六千多名日侨，他们表示愿意长期或者暂时侨居中国。中国政府已经表示，如果他们之中有人申请回国，中国政府仍将给予各种便利，使他们能够实现自己的愿望。这原来就已是一个不成问题的问题。因此，日本政府所宣称的什么在华日侨返国问题目前陷入困难等等说法，是根本上与事实不符的，并且是有意歪曲的。事实上，中国红十字会仍在继续援助愿意返回日本的日侨回归日本，同时日本红十字会，日中友好协会，日本和平联络会三团体与中国红十字会所签署的协议，至今依然有效。中日两国的民间团体过去合作得很好，今后也会很好地合作下去的。因此，如果要谈“侨民问题”的话，正如事实证明：中日之间需要谈判解决的绝不是单方面的所谓“日侨问题”，而应是双方侨民的问题，换言之，日本侨民问题早已基本上解决了，现在主要应谈及的，正是中国在日本的侨民问题。
    东京华侨总会的声明还表明：日本政府对于过去被掳到日本去受奴役的大批中国人的下落还没有作出交代。根据东京华侨总会所掌握的材料，在日本军国主义者侵华期间被掳到日本的中国人共达三万八千九百三十五名，被杀害的达六千八百三十名。必须指出，这是至今为止，根据在日华侨在万分困难条件下以各种形式逐个调查出来的数字，这只能是最保守的统计，是不能概括全貌的。譬如日本“赤旗报”在一九五○年一月二十二日报道，据战时专门从事调查中国被俘军人和劳工的“中国研究所”的盐胁说，战时被掳往日本的中国战俘大约有十六、七万人。
    正如东京华侨总会的声明所指出的，日本政府不但至今不肯对这一大批在日本进行侵略战争时被掳到日本的中国人的下落作出交代，而且还阻挠对他们的情况进行调查。一直到一九五○年才被揭露的在日本本州北部花岗矿山虐杀中国战俘和工人四百多人的大惨案，就是一个显明的例子。这个惨案是留日华侨民主促进会的机关报“华侨民报”在一九五○年一月十一日首先揭露的。这家华侨报纸随后又揭露了在北海道平和矿山、秋田县的船川、浅川奥的与濑以及京都府的与谢野郡与谢野村都发生过类似的惨案。东京华侨总会在一九五○年二月要求日本政府处理花岗惨案的遗骨，并彻底追究凶手。但是日本政府不但根本置之不理，反而在一九五○年九月二十八日封闭了“华侨民报”。后来还是由华侨总会在日中友好协会等日本民间团体的协助下收集了这些遗骨，并把它们送回了祖国。至于其他地方所发生的惨案，日本政府一直到现在还没有要作任何调查的迹象。
    很明显，日本政府有责任立即对所有这些惨案进行彻底调查，并将成千成万被掳去的中国人的下落向中国人民作出负责的交代。但是日本政府对此却完全避而不谈，反而无中生有地要求和中国政府讨论所谓在日本侵华战争中“不知下落”的完全虚构的四万名日本人的问题。似乎对这些被驱使来进行侵略战争的日本人应该负责的倒不是日本政府而是中国政府，这不能不说是十分荒谬的事情。日本政府在日本人民普遍要求恢复中日两国正常关系的时候提出这种富有挑拨性的莫须有的问题，并且把这种问题的解决作为恢复中日两国正常关系的先决条件，其动机是值得怀疑的。
    在日华侨欢迎中日两国友好关系的加强，支持中国外交部发言人八月十六日的声明，并对日本政府的荒谬态度感到愤慨，这是完全可以理解的。因为不仅华侨有此感觉，而且有正义感的日本人士中也普遍有此感觉。东京华侨总会所发表的声明，又一次有力地证实了我国外交部发言人八月十六日的声明所发表的铁一般的事实。日本政府对其屡次所作的“改善中日间关系”的说法如果有一丝一毫的诚意，它就该立即纠正它在中日两国侨民问题上的不正确的态度，以便从日本人民的利益出发，实事求是地解决有关中日两国人民利益的许多重大问题。中国政府已经表示准备和日本政府谈判这些问题。现在是考验日本政府对于寻求中日关系正常化是否具有诚意的时候了。
