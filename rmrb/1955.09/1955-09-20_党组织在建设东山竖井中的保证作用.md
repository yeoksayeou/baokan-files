The modern Hegang Coal Mine's Dongshan Shaft has been put into production. This is another new victory in China's industrialization process.

During the five-year shaft construction process, the Party organization at the Dongshan Shaft construction site, under the leadership of the superior Party committee, unswervingly struggled against various erroneous ideas to comprehensively achieve -- good, economical, fast, and safe completion of the construction task. During the shaft lining, the engineering team leader and engineers, in order to ensure the quality of the project, disregarded speed and economy. At that time, the technical operating regulations stipulated that each shift was only allowed to lay four meters. When some workers requested to exceed four meters, the team leader and engineers firmly disagreed, believing that the quality of the project could not be guaranteed. In order to overcome the conservative thinking of these people, the Party organization immediately sent people to understand the situation among the workers and technicians. The results proved that on the premise of ensuring the quality of the project, each shift could completely exceed four meters per day. Under the suggestion and supervision of the Party organization, the engineering team revised the technical operating regulations, thereby guaranteeing the progress of the shaft project. In roadway excavation, some leading staff members had a one-sided view of the task, and some workers did not abide by the operating regulations during construction, resulting in extremely low project quality. At this time, in addition to supervising the administration to strictly implement regulations and systems and transferring outstanding staff to serve as inspectors, the Party organization also universally carried out education on quality first among employees, promoted the administration and trade union to summarize and promote the construction experience of Hao Shutang's team, which had good engineering quality, and organized workers to visit projects with good quality and projects with poor quality, and then organized them to have discussions on their observations, so that they could ideologically recognize the importance of abiding by operating regulations and systems. As a result, since July 1954, major quality accidents have been eliminated, ensuring the quality of the entire project. The Party organization also criticized the thinking among employees that "the country is vast and wealthy, so there is no need to pay attention to savings," and educated employees with the advanced thinking and deeds of people like Jia Dexiang who were always mindful of saving, thereby promoting the development of mass savings work.

The Dongshan Shaft project is a complex project. To ensure the smooth completion of this project, the Party organization at the construction site and all Party members played an active role in each project. At the beginning of 1954, when the key project to determine whether the shaft could be handed over to production ahead of schedule – the construction of the South No. 1 chute roadway – could only be excavated at a rate of 30 to 40 meters per month. If this continued, the shaft construction task could not be completed on schedule. At that time, Soviet experts suggested organizing a good excavation team to carry out a competition to advance 100 meters per month. After studying the experts' suggestions, the Party organization and administrative departments at the construction site transferred seven Party members, headed by the national labor model Liu Jingchi, and another seventeen workers to form a rapid excavation team, strengthening the excavation force of the South No. 1 chute roadway. The Party organization also supervised the administrative department to solve problems such as electromechanical supply and transportation. As a result, in April, a record of 110 meters of progress per month was created, and the roadway was tunneled through ahead of schedule on August 20. The zero intersection point is the main passage for transportation. When the underground civil engineering had been basically completed and turned to a large amount of mechanical installation work, the excavation work at the intersection point had not yet been completed. The Party branch at the construction site held a Party member meeting and resolved to complete this project ahead of schedule. Under the leadership of Communists Zhang Guangjin, Li Defu and other comrades, technician Shi Jinbi changed the construction method, thereby completing the task ahead of schedule and ensuring that a large amount of equipment could pass through here on time and be transported to the installation site. For example, in August 1954, the construction task of the headframe on the ground of the auxiliary shaft was very heavy, and it was also a project closely related to installation and civil engineering. If all the foundation work could not be completed in August, the installation project could not be completed before the ground froze. The Party branch at the construction site earnestly discussed this issue and decided that all civil engineering tasks should be completed in August. During the construction, when it rained, Communist Party member and deputy director of the work area Li Lin still led all the workers to insist on construction. The slogan "No leaving work until the task is completed!" proposed by the Communist Youth League member Zhao Mingren was supported by all employees. With the active labor of all workers, the foundation project was finally completed in August. In short, on every important project, Communist Party members responded to the call of the Party, took a fighting stance to lead the workers to overcome difficulties, and powerfully guaranteed the completion of the shaft construction task.

The Dongshan Shaft is equipped with the most advanced technology. In order to complete the construction task of this new mine with complex technical equipment, it is necessary to mobilize all employees to learn from the Soviet Union and from Soviet experts. The Party organization clearly recognized that earnestly implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is an effective way to learn from the Soviet Union. It pointed out that learning from the Soviet Union is one of the manifestations of the Party spirit of Communist Party members. In this way, a firm idea of learning from the Soviet Union was established among all employees, especially among Party member cadres. Subsequently, the administrative side also established a series of systems to ensure the implementation of expert suggestions. A wave of learning from the Soviet Union was set off throughout the construction site. With the kind and patient help of the experts, the engineering technicians who previously did not know how to sink shafts are now not only able to guide shaft construction, but also able to do part of the design.

The construction team for the shaft was a newly organized team, and the political and technical levels of the employees were very low. This requires the Party organization to constantly conduct political and ideological education for employees, continuously improve the political consciousness of employees, and lay a solid ideological foundation for completing the shaft construction task. The Party organization publicized the great prospect of building socialism to employees, and educated them with the thoughts and deeds of advanced figures, so that everyone could recognize the significance of their work and feel at ease and love their work. In previous political movements and in daily work, due to the Party's patient ideological work, the consciousness of employees has been greatly improved, and their labor enthusiasm has also been improved. For example, workers Zhang Fenghe, Jia Dexiang and others were in poor health, but they never left their posts, showing boundless labor enthusiasm. Under the education of the Party, a large number of outstanding workers have joined the Communist Party, strengthening the Party's ranks in capital construction.

    党组织在建设东山竖井中的保证作用
    中共东山竖井工程队总支书记　孙起昌
    现代化的鹤岗煤矿东山竖井投入生产了，这是我国工业化进程中的又一个新的胜利。
    在五年的建井过程中，东山竖井工地的党组织，在上级党委的领导下，为全面——好、省、快、安全地完成建设任务，曾坚持不渝地向各种错误思想进行了斗争。在井筒砌壁的时候，工程队长、工程师为了保证工程质量，就不顾快和省。当时，技术操作规程规定每小班只许砌四公尺，有的工人要求超过四公尺时，队长和工程师坚决不同意，认为不能保证工程质量。为了克服这些人的保守思想，党组织即派人到工人和技术人员中去了解，结果证明在保证工程质量的条件下每天每一班完全可以超过四公尺。在党组织的建议和督促下，工程队修改了技术操作规程，从而保证了井筒工程进度。在巷道掘进中，部分领导工作人员有片面的任务观点，有些工人在施工中不遵守操作规程，致使工程质量异常低劣。这时，党组织除监督行政严格执行规程制度、抽调优秀工作人员担任检查员外，还在职工中普遍进行了质量第一的教育，推动行政和工会总结和推广了工程质量好的郝树堂小组的施工经验，组织工人参观质量好的工程和不好的工程，然后组织他们座谈参观观感，使他们从思想上认清遵守操作规程、制度的重要性，因而从一九五四年七月以来就杜绝了大的质量事故，保证了整个工程的质量。党组织还批判了职工中那种家大业大不注意节省的思想，并以经常注意节约的贾德祥等先进思想和事迹向职工进行教育，从而促进了群众性的节约工作的开展。
    东山竖井工程是一个复杂的工程，为保证这一工程的顺利完成，工地党组织和全体党员在各个工程中都发挥了积极作用。一九五四年初，决定竖井能否提前移交生产的关键工程——南一槽大巷施工时，每月只能掘进三、四十公尺，如继续这样干下去，就不能按期完成建井任务。当时苏联专家建议组织好的掘进队，开展月进百公尺的竞赛。工地党的组织和行政部门，在研究了专家的建议之后，抽调了以全国劳动模范刘景池为首的七名党员和另外十七名工人组成快速掘进队，充实了南一槽大巷的掘进力量。党组织并监督行政部门解决了机电供应和运输等问题，结果在四月份就创造了月进一百一十公尺的纪录，并提前在八月二十日凿通了巷道。零号交叉点是运输的主要通口，当井下的土建工程已基本上建成而转入大量机械安装工作时，交叉点的发?工程尚未完成。工地党支部召开了党员大会，决议提前完成这项工程。在共产党员张光金、李德福等同志带动下，技术员史锦壁同志改变了施工方法，从而提前完成了任务，保证了大量设备按时从这里通过，运向安装的地方。又如在一九五四年八月间，井上的副井井棚施工任务很重，同时又是安装同土建紧密联系的工程，如果八月份不能完成全部基础工程，安装工程就不可能在结冻之前全部竣工。工地党支部大会认真讨论了这个问题，并决定八月份要全部完成土建任务。在施工中遇上了雨天，共产党员、工区副主任李林同志仍然领导着全体工人坚持施工。青年团员赵明仁提出的“不完成任务不下班！”的口号得到了全体职工的拥护。在全体工人的积极劳动下，终于在八月份完成了基础工程。总之，在每个重要的工程上，共产党员都响应党的号召，以战斗的姿态来带动工人克服困难，有力地保证了竖井建设任务的完成。
    东山竖井是以最先进技术装备起来的，要想建成这一个技术装备复杂的新矿井的建设任务，必须动员全体职工向苏联学习，向苏联专家学习。党的组织清楚认识到：认真贯彻苏联专家建议，就是学习苏联的有效办法。指出向苏联学习是共产党员党性的表现之一。这样便在全体职工中首先是党员干部中，树立了坚固的学习苏联的思想。随后行政方面又建立了一系列的制度，来保证专家建议的贯彻。全工地掀起了学习苏联的热潮。在专家亲切而耐心的帮助下，工程技术人员过去不会打竖井，现在不但能指导竖井的施工，并且能够做部分设计。
    建设竖井的工程队，是一支新组织起来的队伍，职工的政治水平和技术水平很低。这就要求党组织经常对职工进行政治思想教育，不断地提高职工的政治觉悟，为完成建井任务奠定坚实的思想基础。党组织向职工宣传了建设社会主义的伟大远景，并以先进人物的思想和事迹进行教育，使大家认清自己工作的意义，安心并热爱自己的工作。在历次政治运动中，在日常工作中，由于党耐心地进行了思想工作，职工的觉悟大大提高了，劳动积极性也提高了。如工人张凤和、贾德祥等身体不好，但从来没有离开过工作岗位，表现了无限高涨的劳动热情。在党的教育下，已有大批优秀工人参加共产党，壮大了基本建设中党的队伍。
