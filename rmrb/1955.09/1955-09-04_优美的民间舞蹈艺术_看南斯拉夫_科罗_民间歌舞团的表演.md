The performance of each dance program by the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble attracts the audience with great power. From their rich and colorful performances, we have a general understanding of the thoughts and feelings of the Yugoslav people and their lives and struggles, and we also understand that the Yugoslav people have a high level of culture and art.

Why can their performances give people a strong feeling? This is because their programs have beautiful folk colors and a strong atmosphere of life; and in each program, they strive to express certain ideas and themes. Each program truly and simply reflects the different lifestyles and customs of the people of various ethnic groups. The skills of the actors, the composition and changes of the dance scenes, the activities and interrelationships of the characters, and the music closely integrated with the dance are harmoniously organized together to express the content and theme of a dance.

For example, the "Ghermit Dance" of the Macedonian People's Republic depicts a fragment of the struggle of the Ghermit people's guerrillas against Turkish rule and for national liberation. The appearance of the seven warriors with the sound of drums gives people a heroic impression. In the dance, through the description and depiction of scenes such as lookout, searching for the enemy, ambush, attack, fighting with the enemy, being injured, and continuing to advance to attack the enemy, they express their strong and unyielding heroic character and their confidence in victory. This program profoundly expresses the traditional strong and unyielding heroism of the Yugoslav people. The reason why this program is particularly exciting is that its rigorous organization, the changes in composition, and the choice of movements are completely combined with the inner emotions of the characters, and all start from the need to express the struggle against the enemy. The profound ideological content of the program is inseparable from the complete art form. I think this program has reached a high level both politically and artistically.

The "Vlash National Competition Dance" of the Serbian People's Republic fully expresses the Yugoslav people's optimistic emotions of loving life. The humor of the girls and the interest of the young men bring people to a beautiful realm that they yearn for.

From the "Serbian Dance," we can focus on seeing the artistic accomplishment of Comrade Skovran, the artistic director, and the achievements in developing folk art. This is a large-scale group dance, which includes five "Kolo" dances. Each of the five dances has its own different style, characteristics, and sentiment, but these five dances are unified under a theme thought - expressing the happiness and beauty of the life of the Yugoslav people and their noble spiritual world. The ups and downs of emotions change with different dances, and beauty and lightness, warmth and tension complement each other. It can be seen that it not only completely preserves the original style, characteristics, and dance forms, but also, after artistic processing and refinement, makes it more perfect. This is the result of long-term and in-depth research and analysis of Serbian dance.

Here, I cannot but mention the most popular "Šota Dance," which depicts the love between a girl and a young man. The young girl uses various dance movements to show her lover that she can do all the housework. The actress's performance is particularly moving. She portrays a lively, beautiful, and labor-loving girl. It is difficult for you to say whether her dance is flexible or soft, light or vigorous. It seems that her whole body - from heel to fingertip, every joint and every muscle - is dancing to the rhythm of the music. Her movements make you feel like a little bird that has just awakened in spring is flying in the sky, or like a gentle spring breeze is blowing a beautiful feather floating in the sky, both fresh and beautiful. The love expressed in their very interesting duet is profound and moving, and even the slightest emotional changes are clearly presented to the audience. The happiness and joy of young people's love that they express gives the audience a strong infection.

Any art, especially dance art, cannot fully express its theme and content without superb skills, and cannot give the audience infection. The "Classical Bosnian Mute Dance" performed by the song and dance troupe shows the actors' skills and dance accomplishments. We know that to express the content of a dance, a large part of it must be borrowed from music. It is difficult for actors to dance and create roles without the rhythm and melody of music. However, the actors in this dance brilliantly completed their performance tasks. The touching power of this dance is very strong, and this is also inseparable from the actors' skills. Although there is no musical accompaniment, their movements are very neat and consistent. No one misses a beat, even in slow or fast dance steps. It can be said that the actors' inner emotional changes are the melody of this dance, and the beautiful dance steps are the rhythm of this dance. In the dance, the young men constantly shake the girls' hands with force to examine whether the other party is healthy and hardworking, sometimes it is a slow dance step, and sometimes it is a powerful rotation, which expresses the healthy spirit of the people. The song and dance troupe has perfectly preserved the legacy of classical art and given it careful development, so that it can be passed down among the people, which shows their infinite love and importance to their national art. I think this is also a concrete manifestation of their patriotism.

The "Lindo Dance" of the Croatian People's Republic, with its peaceful and tranquil dance steps and powerful and rapid rotations, forms a clear contrast, highlighting the characters' personalities and inner world. It is impossible to fully describe the feelings given to me by all the programs of the performance, because each program has its own different style and characteristics. We know that the "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble pays special attention to the collection and excavation of folk dances. They often send members to learn dance in the folk and actively participate in national song and dance festivals to observe and learn. At the same time, they also pay great attention to popularization work. They have close and inseparable links with the artistic traditions of the folk and the development of folk art. This is the reason why the troupe has maintained a vigorous vitality in its creation and performance, and why their programs have a deep people's character.

The visit and performance of the Yugoslav "Kolo" Folk Dance Ensemble in China will undoubtedly make the people of our two countries more understanding, so that we have the opportunity to exchange and learn from each other in culture and art. I firmly believe that the friendship between the people of our two countries will be further developed and consolidated. (Attached picture)

    优美的民间舞蹈艺术
    ——看南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团的表演
    隆荫培
    南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团演出的每一个舞蹈节目，都以极大的力量吸引着观众。从他们丰富多采的演出里，我们概括地了解了南斯拉夫人民的思想情感和他们的生活和斗争，也了解了南斯拉夫人民有着高度的文化艺术水平。
    为什么他们的演出能够给人一种强烈的感受呢？这是因为他们的节目都有着优美的民间色彩和浓厚的生活气息；并且在每一个节目里都力求表达出一定的思想和主题来。每个节目都真实和朴素地反映了各民族人民不同的生活和风俗面貌。演员们的技巧，舞蹈画面的构图和变化，角色的活动和互相联系以及同舞蹈紧密结合着的音乐，都是为了表现一个舞蹈的内容和主题而和谐无间地组织在一起的。
    例如马其顿人民共和国的“格米特舞”表现了格米特人民游击队反对土耳其统治，争取祖国解放的斗争的片断。七勇士伴着鼓声一出场就给人一种英勇的印象，在舞蹈中通过瞭望，寻察敌人，埋伏，袭击，与敌厮杀，受伤，继续前进打击敌人等场面的描写和刻划，表现了他们坚强不屈的英勇性格和必胜的信心。这个节目深刻地表现了南斯拉夫人民传统的坚强不屈的英雄气概。这个节目之所以特别激动人心，就在于它组织的严谨，构图的变化和动作的选择完全同人物的内心情绪结合在一起，都是从表现与敌斗争的需要而出发的。节目的深刻思想内容是同完整的艺术形式不可分离的，我认为这个节目不论从政治性或是从艺术性上来讲都达到了高度的水平。
    塞尔维亚人民共和国的“弗拉希民族竞赛舞”充分地表现了南斯拉夫人民热爱生活的乐观的情绪。少女们的幽默，小伙子们的情趣，把人带到一种令人向往的美好境界中去。
    从“塞尔维亚舞”中我们可以集中地看出艺术指导斯科夫兰同志的艺术修养和发展民间艺术的成绩。这是一个大型的组舞，其中包括了五个“科罗”舞蹈，五个舞蹈各有其不同的风格、特色和情调，但是这五个舞蹈又在一个主题思想——表现南斯拉夫人民生活的幸福和美好，他们高尚的精神世界——的照明下统一起来。情绪的起伏随着不同的舞蹈而变化着，优美和轻快，热烈和紧张互相对称互相增补。可以看出，它不单完整地保留了原来舞蹈的风格、特色和舞蹈的形式，而且经过艺术上的加工和提炼，使其更加完善了。这是对塞尔维亚的舞蹈经过了长期和深入的研究和分析的结果。
    在这里我还不能不提到最受观众欢迎的“莎达舞”，这是描写一个少女和一个小伙子的爱情的舞蹈。年轻的姑娘通过各种舞蹈动作向自己的情人显示她是能从事一切家务的。女演员的表演特别动人，她刻划了一个活泼、美丽、热爱劳动的少女形象。她的舞蹈很难让你说出是灵活还是柔美，是轻快还是矫健，好像她的全身——从脚跟一直到指尖，每一个关节和每一块肌肉都在合着音乐的节拍而舞动着。她的动作，使你感觉好像在春天刚刚苏醒的小鸟在天空飞翔，又好像是温柔的春风在吹拂着飘在天空中的一支美丽的羽毛，既清新又美丽。从他们非常有情趣的对舞中表现的爱情是深刻而动人的，就连最细微的感情变化也很清楚地呈现在观众的面前。他们所表现出来的年轻人的爱情的幸福和愉快给予了观众强烈的感染。
    任何艺术，尤其是舞蹈艺术，若没有高超的技巧便不能充分表达它的主题和内容，也就不能给观众以感染。歌舞团所表演的“古典波斯尼亚哑舞”就显示了演员们的这种技巧和舞蹈素养。我们知道，要表现舞蹈的内容，很大一部分是要借助于音乐的。演员们离开了音乐的节奏和旋律是很难舞蹈起来并进行角色创造的。但是，这个舞蹈的演员们却天才地完成了表演任务。这个舞蹈感人的力量是很强烈的，而这也是同演员们的技巧分不开的，虽然没有音乐的伴奏，但是他们的动作却非常整齐一致，不管在缓慢的还是在急速的舞步中，甚至没有一个人踏错半拍节奏。可以说演员们的内在情感的变化就是这个舞蹈的旋律，优美的舞步就是这个舞蹈的节奏。在舞蹈中小伙子们不断地用力摇动着姑娘们的手，来考察对方是否健康和刻苦耐劳，有时是轻缓的舞步，有时又是有力的旋转，这都表现了人民健康的气魄。歌舞团是这样完美地保存了古典艺术的遗产，并给予了精心的发展，使得它在人民中间流传下去，这正表现了他们对于自己民族艺术无限的热爱和重视。我觉得这也正是他们爱国主义的具体表现。
    克罗地亚人民共和国的“林德若舞”，平和、恬静的舞步和有力的迅速的旋转，形成了鲜明的对衬，把人物的性格和内心世界突出地表现了出来。想来全面的描写演出的全部节目所给予我的感受是不可能的，因为每一个节目都有着它不同的风格和特点。我们知道“科罗”民间歌舞团是特别重视民间舞的收集和发掘工作的，他们经常派团员去民间学习舞蹈和积极地参加全国的歌舞节进行观摩学习，同时也非常注意普及的工作。他们同民间的艺术传统和民间艺术的发展有着紧密不可分的联系，这就是该团在创作和演出中保持了蓬勃的生命力，使他们的节目具有深厚的人民性的原因。
    南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团在中国的访问演出，无疑地会使我们两国人民更加了解，使得我们在文化艺术上有互相交流学习的机会，我深信我们两国人民的友谊也必将得到进一步的发展和巩固。（附图片）
