Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, September 2nd: According to TASS, the Council of the International Union of Students (IUS) held its 10th annual meeting in Sofia from August 27th to 31st. Ninety-six delegates and one hundred and nine observers from seventy-two countries participated in the meeting.

    IUS Secretary-General Jiří Pelikán delivered a report on the international student movement and the tasks of the IUS. He pointed out that the characteristic of the student movements in many countries this year is the strengthening of the struggle for the democratization of higher education and the popularization of education. He said that one of the main tasks of the IUS is to prepare for the Fourth World Student Congress to be held in 1956.

    Harish Chandra (India) made a report on the issue of convening the Fourth World Student Congress. He proposed inviting student organizations that have not joined the IUS to participate in the Congress and holding extensive discussions with national student unions that have disagreements with the IUS.

    The meeting held a three-day discussion on the above two reports. Speakers advocated expanding contacts between students of various countries and establishing unity in the student movement. They also talked about the living and studying conditions of students in their own countries and put forward some suggestions for improving the work of the IUS.

    At the meeting on August 31st, the suggestions made by the committees on the activities and tasks of students in colonial and dependent countries, students' economic and learning problems, and cultural cooperation issues were adopted.

    In the resolution adopted on the international student movement and the tasks of the IUS, the meeting approved the IUS's plans and general guidelines.

    The meeting also adopted a decision to convene the Fourth World Student Congress in 1956 and entrusted the Executive Committee to determine the time and place of the meeting and the procedures for the Congress.
