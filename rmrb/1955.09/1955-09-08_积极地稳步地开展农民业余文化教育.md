Actively and Steadily Carry Out Farmers' Spare-Time Cultural Education
Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education

Since 1953, China has embarked on its first Five-Year Plan for economic construction, gradually realizing the nation's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The socialist transformation of agriculture is mainly through the path of production collectivization. The current basic task in rural areas is to carry out agricultural production increase campaigns centered on mutual aid and cooperation. At present, there is still a large number of illiterate people in rural China, and the cultural level of farmers is very low, which is incompatible with the requirements of developing mutual aid and cooperation movements and developing agricultural production. In the process of realizing agricultural production collectivization and developing agricultural production, farmers' need for culture is growing, especially the need of rural staff, activists, and agricultural production cooperative members to improve their cultural level is becoming more urgent. In the future, after the realization of collectivization and the further implementation of agricultural production mechanization, farmers will feel an even greater need for cultural and scientific knowledge.

In recent years, rural life practice has illustrated the need for collectivization and production development for culture in the following aspects: First, running agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams requires evaluating work, bookkeeping, formulating production plans, and registering farm tools, and doing these tasks requires literacy and numeracy. Second, improving farming techniques, improving farm tools, building water conservancy projects, improving soil, applying fertilizer rationally, and preventing plant diseases and insect pests all require farmers to have a certain amount of scientific knowledge. Third, in order to improve farmers' political awareness, enable them to consciously respond to the call of the Party and the People's Government, and better complete their production and work tasks, it is also necessary to teach farmers and cadres to read and write, and learn to read newspapers and documents.

Economy is the foundation, and without economic development, culture cannot develop. Developing the economy is the prerequisite for developing culture. However, developing the economy also requires a corresponding development of culture to make culture serve the economy. If the economy develops without developing culture, cultural backwardness will hinder economic development. To realize the social revolution (collectivization) and technological revolution (mechanization) of agricultural production, it is also necessary to correspondingly realize the cultural revolution in rural areas. Lenin once said: "Cultural work among the peasants, if it is regarded as an economic aim, is precisely to implement collectivization. ... But the condition for this complete collectivization includes a high cultural level of the peasants (precisely the broad masses of peasants), that is, without the entire cultural revolution, complete collectivization is impossible." (On Cooperation). Implementing a cultural revolution in rural areas means eradicating illiteracy and popularizing compulsory education, so that farmers become cultured and educated people, so that they can use modern agricultural science and technology to engage in agricultural production. This also means that to realize the collectivization and mechanization of agricultural production, farmers must also master culture. It is impossible to build a socialist agriculture without culture for the peasants. Socialism cannot be built on the basis of a large number of illiterate people. Improving the cultural level of farmers is an important condition for increasing labor productivity.

In addition to this, farmers are also the main reserve force for the national defense forces and the industrial front, so the improvement of farmers' cultural level is also of considerable significance for building a strong modernized national defense force and carrying out large-scale industrial construction in the country.

From this, it can be seen that improving the cultural level of farmers has become a major task at present. With the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production, farmers' spare-time cultural education must develop accordingly. It is wrong to neglect farmers' spare-time cultural education.

According to the requirements of the state's general task during the transition period, the basic policy task of farmers' spare-time cultural education in the future must be to closely follow and closely combine with the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production, actively and plannedly eliminate illiteracy in rural areas, and gradually improve the cultural level of farmers, effectively serving the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production. It is required that the illiteracy of young and middle-aged people in rural areas be basically eliminated during the transition period. In the next three to five years, strive to basically eliminate illiteracy among the main township cadres nationwide; in areas where agricultural production cooperatives have developed earlier and have a better foundation, eliminate illiteracy among most existing members and activists, and a portion of non-member young and middle-aged people; in other areas, strive to have a portion of members, mutual aid team members, activists, and other young and middle-aged farmers enroll in school; and gradually eliminate a portion of illiteracy. At the same time, those farmers who have already escaped illiteracy and primary school graduates should be organized to study in order to continue to improve their cultural level.

According to the above-mentioned policy task, the current focus of carrying out farmers' spare-time cultural education is to eliminate illiteracy, and gradually improve the cultural level of farmers on the basis of eliminating illiteracy. The target is mainly cadres and activists. In the past, the policy of "mainly cadres and activists" was not well implemented, and in the future, all difficulties must be overcome and resolutely implemented.

Eliminating rural illiteracy is an arduous task. Carrying out this work must be both active and steady. We should understand the difficulties and favorable conditions of doing this work, so as to strive to overcome the difficulties and give full play to the role of the favorable conditions, so that it can proceed smoothly. The illiteracy left over from the old society in rural areas is in the hundreds of millions, the current rural economy is still very backward, the living standards of farmers are still low, farmers are busy with production, and there is not much time for study, and Chinese characters are difficult to learn - all these situations determine the long-term and arduous nature of eliminating rural illiteracy. It is impossible to eliminate illiteracy all at once in a short period of time without seeing these situations. Hasty advances are not possible. On the other hand, the realization of land reform, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the increasing growth of agricultural production, the gradual improvement of farmers' lives, and the continuous improvement of political awareness will all promote farmers' desire to learn culture, and organizing them is also conducive to farmers' learning. It is unfounded to not see this aspect of the situation, to overstate the difficulty of eliminating illiteracy, and thus lack confidence in the work of eliminating illiteracy. After correcting the tendency of blind advances, some people have adopted a passive and conservative attitude towards the work of eliminating illiteracy, which is also wrong.

Starting from the above-mentioned situation, in order to correctly implement the policy task of farmers' spare-time cultural education, the work should be carried out in accordance with the following implementation principles:

I. Farmers' spare-time cultural education should be combined with politics

Comrade Mao Zedong has long instructed us to "educate the peasants with socialism" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II). In the future, we must vigorously conduct socialist education among the peasants. Winter schools and people's schools are important places to conduct socialist education among the broad masses of peasants. In order to make people's schools and winter schools truly shoulder the task of conducting socialist education among the broad masses of peasants, the following points should be achieved:

1. Farmers' spare-time schools (including people's schools and winter schools) should all have political classes in order to conduct political education among farmers in a planned manner. The basic task of current political education is to educate the peasants with socialism. Its main contents are education on the general task of the state during the transition period and education on the Constitution. It is necessary to specifically explain to them the policies on mutual aid and cooperation, the policies on developing agricultural production on the basis of mutual aid and cooperation, as well as the policies on socialist industrialization, close integration of industry and agriculture, and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance; and it is necessary to conduct education on patriotism and internationalism among them. The idea that winter schools and people's schools can do without political classes is wrong.

2. The cultural classes of farmers' spare-time schools should permeate socialist ideological content. Culture cannot be separated from politics. Any view that opposes culture and politics is wrong. Farmers' spare-time schools should not only teach farmers to read and learn culture through cultural classes, but also instill socialist ideas into farmers, and help them overcome superstitious ideas and conservative ideas on the basis of teaching scientific knowledge.

3. Farmers' spare-time schools should cooperate with the central work and the ideological situation of the masses to conduct political and ideological education among the peasants. Conducting political and ideological education among the peasants cannot be done by preaching empty and abstract political concepts, but should be good at combining with real political life, focusing on the current central work in rural areas, addressing the actual ideological problems of the peasants, explaining policies with concrete examples, explaining the truth clearly, enlightening awareness, so that they can realize the correctness of the Party and government policies, and consciously and willingly resolutely implement these policies. We should be good at continuously improving the socialist consciousness of the peasants through the propaganda and mobilization work of various central tasks.

Combining with politics is a fine tradition in our country's industrial and agricultural spare-time cultural education work. We should carry forward this fine tradition and resolutely oppose the tendency to separate from politics in farmers' spare-time cultural education. Separating from politics will lead our cultural and educational work to make principled mistakes. But on the other hand, we must also prevent the tendency to only talk about politics in empty terms and neglect cultural learning.

II. Farmers' spare-time cultural education should be combined with production

The teaching content of the cultural classes of farmers' spare-time schools should be based on the needs of agricultural production, in accordance with the principle of learning for application, including some of the most necessary common sense for farmers' lives and agricultural production, such as commonly used simple language common sense, natural science common sense, and agricultural science common sense, combining learning and application. The tendency of separating learning from application and separating education from production must be prevented. In the stage of eliminating illiteracy and literacy teaching, literacy textbooks should be compiled with commonly used words in rural life, so that they can be learned and applied. In the stage of eliminating illiteracy, if conditions permit, some abacus calculation can also be learned. According to the current needs of rural production, the curriculum of the higher primary school classes of farmers' spare-time schools should include language and arithmetic, and if conditions permit, a common sense class can be set up (including production common sense and political common sense). Due to the needs of agricultural production development, our farmers must gradually improve their cultural level to higher primary school and even higher levels on the basis of eliminating illiteracy.

For primary and secondary school graduates engaged in agricultural production, they are generally organized to study independently to continue to improve their cultural and political level. In addition to further improving their language skills and calculation abilities, they should also be organized to learn scientific knowledge related to agricultural production. In places where conditions permit, rural youth schools can be piloted with emphasis.

Farmers' cultural learning organizations should be combined with agricultural production organizations. In recent years, some areas have established people's schools and winter schools on the basis of agricultural production cooperatives, and established learning groups on the basis of agricultural production mutual aid teams. It is very beneficial to closely combine farmers' learning organizations with production organizations in this way. If agricultural production cooperatives manage the learning of the members, they can uniformly and reasonably arrange the time for production and learning, so that they do not delay each other. At the same time, it is also easier for cooperatives to combine the content of learning with the needs of developing production. Also, issues such as learning expenses and teacher treatment can be well resolved by the cooperatives.

Running schools by agricultural production cooperatives should become the basic direction for the future development of farmers' spare-time cultural education. All localities should actively summarize the experience in this regard and gradually promote it. But whether agricultural production cooperatives should immediately run schools still depends on the situation of the cooperatives. Run them if they can, and don't run them if they can't. Do not force it or be too hasty. Specifically, larger cooperatives that have production on track and a certain foundation for their work can and should consider running schools in the future. Cooperatives that already have people's schools or winter schools should run the people's schools and winter schools well and play a typical demonstration role. Cooperatives with a small scale and a foundation for their work, but cannot run schools independently, can consider running schools jointly by several cooperatives or one cooperative with several mutual aid teams. Cooperatives that have been newly established for a short time, production is not yet on track, and the foundation of work is not yet solid, should not force themselves to run schools for the time being, and it is not too late to run them when conditions are ripe in the future.

Advocating that agricultural production cooperatives run schools does not mean that no mass-run schools are needed other than cooperatives. The existing perennial people's schools, study groups, and winter schools that are not run by cooperatives should not only not be cancelled, but should also be actively run well. If conditions are ripe in the future, then it can be considered to hand over these learning organizations to the management of agricultural production cooperatives. In those places where there are no cooperatives, or where the cooperatives do not yet have the conditions to run schools, winter schools and people's schools are still organized by the masses according to their needs and possible conditions. It should also be explained that running schools by cooperatives does not mean that the leadership of the CPC branch can be dispensed with or weakened. This only means that the farmers' spare-time learning organization is directly responsible for management by the cooperative. Like other rural work, it still relies on the unified leadership of the CPC township branch and the township people's committee, and the active support and assistance of various mass organizations.

Farmers' spare-time cultural education must adhere to the principle of not hindering production and work. It is necessary to be good at using the idle time of production to carry out, to be good at adapting to local conditions, strive to be compatible with the seasonality of agricultural affairs, and also be good at making appropriate arrangements for the time of learning and meetings to solve the contradiction between learning and work. Years of experience have proven that the general law of farmers' learning in most areas of our country is: the winter is relatively idle in agricultural affairs, and more time can be spared for learning; after the spring ploughing, agricultural affairs gradually become busy, and the learning time should be reduced; and learning should be almost stopped during the busy season of agricultural affairs. According to this law, winter schools should be run in the winter idle time, and after the spring ploughing, the winter schools should be transformed into "perennial learning" (during this period, the teaching progress should be consciously slowed down and the teaching weight should be reduced). During the busiest seasons of agricultural affairs such as wheat harvest, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest, vacations should be actively taken. An effective way to solve the contradiction between learning and work is to implement a unified arrangement of working (including meetings) and learning time, so that the two are staggered. At present, many areas have fixed the time for farmers' meetings and learning, and have made specific regulations on the time for political classes and cultural classes during the learning time. In this way, the spare-time cultural learning of farmers can be guaranteed without affecting production or hindering work.

At present, the most difficult thing for learning in rural areas is cadres and activists. They are busy with work, have many meetings, and have no time to study. However, due to the vigorous development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, these people are the most eager to improve their cultural level and working ability. Therefore, we must study effective ways to solve the learning difficulties of cadres and activists.

An effective way to solve the learning difficulties of cadres and activists is to first streamline meetings and reduce concurrent positions, and at the same time, require a planned and reasonable arrangement of their meeting activities and learning time to ensure that they have a certain amount of time for learning. In terms of the organizational form of learning, it must be suitable for the characteristics of cadres. For the main cadres of the township, two methods can be adopted: separate classes and learning away from production. Separate classes should also be combined with methods such as individual self-study and contracted teaching and learning. Under the conditions that work permits, transferring cadres in batches and learning away from production is a better way. This allows for concentrated time to learn using the rapid literacy method. This method can only be limited to the main cadres of the township at present, and the transfer time is best in winter. For general cadres and activists in rural areas, they can generally learn together with the masses. If they miss classes due to work or meetings, the teacher can make up the lessons afterwards. If conditions permit, separate classes can also be considered. In addition to the above-mentioned methods, solving the learning difficulties of cadres and activists also requires guarantees from various organizations, providing convenient conditions for learning, and should strengthen supervision and inspection, and when encountering ideological obstacles, appropriate education and encouragement should be given. To eliminate illiteracy among party member cadres, the party branch must grasp it tightly, the higher level strengthens leadership, and the individual's consciousness and enthusiasm for learning.

III. Carrying out farmers' spare-time cultural education must rely on the masses and adhere to the principle of voluntariness

Carrying out farmers' spare-time cultural education must adhere to the principle of "educating the people by the people," "mainly mobilizing the people to educate themselves." It is necessary to widely mobilize the literate masses to teach the illiterate masses. The practice of wanting to rely solely on the government to hire full-time teachers to carry out the elimination of illiteracy is unrealistic and unworkable. Farmers' spare-time cultural education mainly relies on mass teachers to take on teaching in their spare time, and then equips a small number of full-time teachers as the backbone to take on guidance work. The sources of mass teachers are: one is the masses who have completed the elimination of illiteracy and literacy education over the years; the other is primary and secondary school graduates and other rural intellectuals engaged in agricultural production.

Implementing the principle of "educating the people by the people" must also pay attention to the training and improvement of mass teachers. For mass teachers, we must vigorously strengthen political and ideological leadership, criticize and overcome their negative emotions towards farmers' spare-time cultural education, educate them to be at ease and love their work, and cultivate their sense of honor in serving the masses. At the same time, we must pay special attention to organizing mass teachers to learn culture and business, in order to improve their cultural and business level. The most realistic and effective way to organize them to learn is to "combine with the actual teaching," "learn what you teach," and "supplement what you lack." In peacetime, methods such as teaching research groups, observation teaching, regular teaching of business, and short-term training can be used for learning. Among them, the teaching research group is more effective and should become the main way to train and improve mass teachers in the future. Before the opening of winter school, short-term training should be conducted for winter school teachers, and the training content should focus on business, so that they are familiar with the textbooks and understand the teaching methods.

Farmers' spare-time cultural education is a broad mass movement, and the expenses it requires cannot rely on the government to solve, and must be based on the principle of self-raising by the masses. The methods of self-raising can be formulated by various localities according to their specific circumstances. At present, some agricultural production cooperatives run people's schools and allocate a portion of the public welfare fund as the funding for the people's schools. The mass teachers are also evaluated and credited according to the time they teach as remuneration. These methods have provided some effective experience for properly solving the funding problem of winter schools and people's schools in the future.

Mobilizing farmers to participate in learning must adhere to the principle of voluntariness. We should mobilize and persuade them to consciously and voluntarily participate in learning on the basis of improving the ideological awareness of the peasant masses. Running schools by agricultural production cooperatives should also adhere to the principle of voluntariness. Any coercive methods must be opposed.

IV. Teaching methods must be suitable for the characteristics of farmers, and correctly implement the "quick, practical" teaching policy

First of all, in terms of literacy teaching, it is certainly wrong to mechanically apply the rapid literacy method without looking at the object or considering the conditions; however, the conservative thought of fundamentally negating the advantages of the rapid literacy method is also wrong. In recent years, some areas have adopted the unit literacy teaching method based on the spirit of the rapid literacy method, combining sudden attacks and consolidation, because it is more suitable for the characteristics of adults, so it has a better effect. This improvement in teaching methods is worthy of attention. In the future, various localities should adopt the rapid literacy method if conditions permit, such as winter schools in some places, where the learning time is long and they can learn in a concentrated manner, they can use the basic spirit of the rapid literacy method for teaching. In places where there are no conditions, do not force the use of the rapid literacy method. When using the ordinary teaching method, it is also necessary to appropriately absorb some of the advantages of the rapid literacy method to improve teaching. Secondly, the teaching method must be closely linked to reality, and firmly grasp the principle of "learning for application." Some farmers' spare-time schools, in addition to teaching literacy textbooks, also taught some commonly used words (such as teaching the words "cotton" when planting cotton), and the masses welcomed this method.

It is necessary to fully develop the consciousness and enthusiasm for learning. It is necessary to develop the spirit of hard work and eagerness to learn on the basis of consciousness. Only in this way can we learn well. It is necessary to educate farmers: first, to be good at using spare time to study; second, to have the spirit of "being good at asking questions," and to ask people if they don't understand; and third, to have "perseverance," to be able to persist in learning for a long time, and to oppose hot and cold diseases.

V. Carrying out farmers' spare-time cultural education must rely on the leadership of the Party committee One of the basic keys to strengthening the organizational leadership of farmers' spare-time cultural education lies in closely relying on the leadership of Party committees at all levels. To carry out such a large-scale mass cultural education work, to complete the historical task of eliminating the illiteracy of hundreds of millions of people, it is impossible to achieve without the unified leadership of the Party. Past experience has proven that those areas that can obtain the close leadership of the Party committee, the farmers' spare-time cultural education work there is carried out well, and vice versa. Therefore, we must closely rely on the leadership of the Party committee. We must promptly ask the Party committee for instructions, report our work, so that the Party committee includes the farmers' spare-time cultural education work on their agenda, inspect and discuss this work within a certain period of time, and give us guidance.

To carry out farmers' spare-time cultural education work, under the leadership of the Party committees and people's committees at all levels, it is also necessary to properly solve the issues of institutions and cadres at the same time. Therefore, institutions for industrial and agricultural spare-time education should be set up within the education departments in accordance with the principle of streamlining, and a certain number of capable cadres should be equipped to be responsible for this work full-time.

Eliminating illiteracy is an extremely broad mass work. To complete this major historical task, it is necessary to mobilize social forces and mass forces to assist the government in carrying out the anti-illiteracy movement. To this end, we can learn from the Soviet experience in eliminating illiteracy and establish organizations such as the Anti-Illiteracy Association. Establishing the Anti-Illiteracy Association and widely mobilizing social and mass forces to assist the government in carrying out the anti-illiteracy movement is necessary for carrying out the anti-illiteracy work. However, we still lack experience in this area. Therefore, we should first select individual areas for experimentation, and gradually promote it after gaining a certain amount of experience.

To fully mobilize social forces, we must also obtain the strong support and active help of relevant parties such as the Youth League, the Democratic Women's Federation, the People's Armed Forces Department, agricultural production cooperatives, cultural centers (stations), and the Science Popularization Association. Here, it should be particularly emphasized to rely on the strength of the Youth League. According to the past experience of the Soviet Union, and according to the experience of our country's current work of eliminating illiteracy and consolidating and improving after eliminating illiteracy, it fully shows that the Youth League is the most powerful assistant and pillar in carrying out industrial and agricultural spare-time cultural education work. Therefore, we must rely on the strength of the Youth League, cooperate with them, and jointly do a good job in farmers' spare-time cultural education work.

Eliminating illiteracy among the 500 million agricultural population in the country and continuously improving the cultural level of farmers on the basis of eliminating illiteracy to meet the needs of building a socialist society is a long-term, arduous, and glorious task. We must, under the leadership of the Party and the government, rely on the support of the people of the country, in the spirit of the above-mentioned guidelines and principles, unite as one, and strive to realize this great and glorious task.

    积极地稳步地开展农民业余文化教育
    教育部副部长　董纯才
    从一九五三年起，我国开始了经济建设的第一个五年计划，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。对农业的社会主义改造，主要是通过生产合作化的道路。当前农村的基本任务，就是开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。目前在我国农村里还存在着大量文盲，农民文化水平很低，这是和开展互助合作运动、发展农业生产的要求不相适应的。在实现农业生产合作化、发展农业生产的过程中，农民对于文化的需要日益增长，特别是乡村工作人员、积极分子和农业生产合作社社员更迫切要求提高文化水平。将来在实现合作化之后进一步实行农业生产机械化，那时农民将会感觉更加需要文化科学知识。
    近年来的农村生活实践，已经从这几个方面说明合作化和发展生产对文化的需要：一、办农业生产合作社、互助组都需要评工、记账、订生产计划、登记农具，做这些工作，就要会读、写、算。二、要改进耕作技术、改良农具、兴修水利、改良土壤、合理施肥、防止病虫害，都需要农民有一定的科学知识。三、为了提高农民的政治觉悟，使他们自觉地响应党和人民政府的号召，更好地完成自己的生产和工作任务，也需要教农民和干部识字念书，学会读报和看文件。
    经济是基础，经济不发展，文化不可能发展。发展经济是发展文化的前提。但是发展经济，又要求相应地发展文化，使文化为经济服务。如果发展经济而不发展文化，文化落后就会阻碍经济的发展。要实现农业生产的社会革命（合作化）和技术革命（机械化），那还必须相应地实现农村的文化革命。列宁曾经说过：“农民中的文化工作，如果将它当作经济目的看待，那就正是要实行合作化。……但这完全合作化的条件，是包含有农民（正是广大农民群众）底高度文化水准在内，即如果没有整个的文化革命，那末，完全合作化便是不可能实现的。”（论合作制）。在农村里实行文化革命，就是说要扫除文盲和普及义务教育，使农民都变成有文化有教养的人，使他们能够用现代农业科学技术来从事农业生产。这也就是说，要实现农业生产的合作化和机械化，还必须农民掌握文化。建设社会主义的农业，农民没有文化是不行的。社会主义是不能建立在大量文盲的基础之上的。提高农民的文化水平，是提高劳动生产率的一个重要条件。
    除此以外，农民还是国防部队和工业战线的主要后备军，因此，农民文化水平的提高，对于建立强大的现代化的国防力量和进行国家大规模的工业建设也有着相当重大的意义。
    由此可见，提高农民文化水平，已成为当前一项重大任务。随着农业互助合作运动和农业生产的发展，农民业余文化教育必须作相应的发展。忽视农民业余文化教育是错误的。
    根据国家在过渡时期的总任务的要求，今后农民业余文化教育的基本方针任务，必须是紧紧跟随着和密切结合着农村互助合作运动和农业生产的发展，积极地有计划地扫除农村中的文盲，并逐步提高农民的文化水平，有效地为农业的社会主义改造和发展农业生产服务。要求在过渡时期内基本上扫除农村中的青壮年文盲。在今后三、五年期间，争取在全国范围内基本上扫除主要乡干部中的文盲；在农业生产合作社发展较早和较有基础的地区，扫除大部分现有社员和积极分子中的青壮年文盲及一部分非社员的青壮年文盲；在其他地区，争取一部分社员、互助组组员、积极分子和其他青壮年农民中的文盲入学；并逐步扫除一部分文盲。同时，对已经摆脱文盲状态的农民和小学毕业生应当组织他们学习，以继续提高他们的文化水平。
    根据上述方针任务的规定，当前开展农民业余文化教育工作是着重扫除文盲，并在扫除文盲的基础上逐步提高农民的文化水平。对象是以干部和积极分子为主。过去对“以干部、积极分子为主”的方针没有很好贯彻，今后必须克服一切困难，坚决执行。
    扫除农村文盲是一项艰巨的任务。开展这项工作必须既要积极，又要稳步。我们应当明了做这工作的困难和有利条件，从而努力克服困难，发挥有利条件的作用，使它能顺利进行。旧社会遗留下来的文盲在农村里是数以万万计，当前农村经济还很落后，农民生活水平还低，农民忙于生产，学习时间不多，还有汉字难学——所有这些情况，决定了扫除农村文盲的长期性和艰巨性。不看到这些情况，想要在短期内一下子把文盲扫光，那是办不到的。急躁冒进是不行的。另一方面，土地改革的实现，互助合作运动的发展，农业生产日益增长，农民生活逐年改善，政治觉悟不断提高，这些都会推动农民要求学习文化，同时组织起来了又有利于农民学习。看不见这方面情况，过份夸大扫除文盲的困难，因而对扫除文盲工作缺少信心，这是没有根据的。在纠正盲目冒进的偏向之后，有一些人对扫除文盲工作采取消极保守的态度，那也是错误的。
    从上述情况出发，要正确地贯彻农民业余文化教育的方针任务，就应当按照以下几条实施原则来进行工作：
    一、农民业余文化教育应当同政治相结合
    毛泽东同志早已指示过我们，要“用社会主义教育农民”（毛泽东选集二卷）。今后我们必须大力地向农民进行社会主义教育。冬学和民校正是向广大农民进行社会主义教育的重要场所。要使民校、冬学真正担负起向广大农民进行社会主义教育的任务，应当做到以下几点：
    一、农民业余学校（包括民校和冬学），都应当设政治课，以便有计划地对农民进行政治教育。当前政治教育的基本任务是用社会主义教育农民。它的主要内容是国家在过渡时期的总任务的教育和宪法教育。要具体地向他们讲解关于互助合作的政策，关于在互助合作基础上发展农业生产的政策，以及社会主义工业化、工业农业密切结合和巩固工农联盟的政策；并且应当向他们进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育。那种认为冬学、民校可以不设政治课的想法是不对的。
    二、农民业余学校的文化课应当渗透着社会主义的思想内容。文化是不能脱离开政治的。任何把文化和政治对立起来的看法都是错误的。农民业余学校不仅要通过文化课教农民识字、学文化，同时还要向农民灌输社会主义的思想，要在教学科学知识的基础上帮助他们克服迷信思想和守旧思想。
    三、农民业余学校应当配合中心工作和群众的思想情况向农民进行政治思想教育。向农民进行政治思想教育，不能用空洞的抽象的政治概念来说教，应当善于结合着现实的政治生活，围绕着当前农村的中心工作，针对农民的实际思想问题，用具体事例来解释政策，讲清道理，启发觉悟，使他们认识到党和政府政策的正确，能自觉自愿地坚决执行这些政策。应当善于通过各项中心工作的宣传鼓动工作，来不断地提高农民的社会主义觉悟。
    结合政治是我国工农业余文化教育工作中的一个优良传统。我们应当发扬这一优良传统，坚决反对在农民业余文化教育中脱离政治的偏向。脱离政治就会导致我们的文化教育工作犯原则性的错误。但是另一方面也要防止只空洞讲政治，忽视文化学习的偏向。
    二、农民业余文化教育应当同生产相结合
    农民业余学校文化课的教学内容，应当根据农业生产的需要，按照学以致用的原则，包括农民生活和农业生产最必需的一些常识，如常用的简单的语文常识，自然科学常识和农业科学常识，把学和用结合起来。学用脱节、教育和生产脱节的倾向必须注意防止。在扫除文盲识字教学阶段，识字课本应当以农村生活中常用字来编，这样就可以学以致用。在扫除文盲阶段，如果有条件也可以学习一些珠算。根据目前农村生产的需要，农民业余学校高小班的课程，应当包括语文、算术两科，有条件的可以设常识课（包括生产常识和政治常识）。由于农业生产发展的需要，我们的农民必须在扫除文盲的基础上逐步把自己的文化程度提高到高小以至更高的水平。
    对从事农业生产的小学和初中毕业学生，一般是组织他们自学，继续提高他们的文化、政治水平，除进一步提高他们的语文程度和计算能力外，还应当组织他们学习有关农业生产的科学知识。在有条件的地方，可以重点试办农村青年学校。
    农民的文化学习组织应当同农业生产组织相结合。近年来有些地区以农业生产合作社为基础建立民校、冬学，以农业生产互助组为基础建立学习小组，这样把农民的学习组织和生产组织密切结合起来，有很大的好处。由农业生产合作社管社员的学习，就可以统一合理安排生产和学习的时间，使彼此互不耽误。同时，合作社办学，也比较容易使学习的内容和发展生产的需要结合起来。还有，学习费用和教师待遇等问题也都可以很好地由合作社解决。
    农业生产合作社办学应当成为今后发展农民业余文化教育的基本方向，各地应当积极总结这方面的经验，逐步推行。但是目前农业生产合作社是不是立刻就要办学，那还要根据社的情况来决定，能办就办，不能办就不办，千万不要勉强、操之过急。具体地说：凡生产已上轨道，工作有一定基础的较大的社，今后就可以也应当考虑办学。目前已经办有民校或冬学的社，就要把民校、冬学办好，起典型示范作用。凡社的规模较小，工作虽然有基础，但是还不能单独办学，可以考虑由几个社或一个社带上几个互助组联合办学。凡新建社不久，生产还没有上轨道，工作基础还不巩固，目前尚欠办学条件的社，暂时就不要勉强办学，等以后条件成熟的时候再办也不迟。
    提倡农业生产合作社办学，并不等于说除社以外就不要群众办学了。现有不是社办的常年民校、学习小组和冬学，不但不要取消，而且还应当积极办好。如果以后条件成熟，到那时就可以考虑把这些学习组织交农业生产合作社管理。在那些没有社的地方，或者社还没有条件办学的地方，仍然是根据群众需要和可能条件，发动群众举办冬学和民校。还要说明由社办学，也不是说可以不要或者削弱中共支部的领导。这只是说，农民业余学习组织由社直接负责管理，它和其他农村工作一样，仍然是要依靠中共乡支部和乡人民委员会的统一领导、各群众团体的积极支持和协助。
    农民业余文化教育，必须坚持不妨碍生产、工作的原则，要善于利用生产的空闲来进行，要善于因时制宜，力求同农事的季节性相适应，还要善于把学习和会议的时间作适当安排，以解决学习和工作的矛盾。多年的经验证明，我国大部分地区的农民学习的一般规律是：冬季农事较闲，可以抽出较多时间学习；春耕后，农事渐渐忙起来，学习时间就要减少一些；到农忙季节差不多就要停止学习。按照这个规律，就应该利用冬闲办冬学，到春耕以后，就把冬学转变为“常年学习”（在这期间就有意识地放缓教学进度，减轻教学分量）。在麦收、夏锄、秋收等农事最忙的季节，就主动放假。解决学习和工作矛盾的有效办法，是实行统一安排工作（包括会议）和学习的时间，使两者互相交错开。目前不少地区都是把农民开会时间和学习时间固定安排好，对学习时间，又把政治课和文化课的时间作了具体的规定。这样就可以在不影响生产、不妨碍工作的条件下，保证农民的业余文化学习。
    目前在农村最感学习困难的是干部和积极分子，他们工作忙，会议多，没功夫学习。而目前由于农村互助合作运动的蓬勃发展，又是这些人最迫切要求提高文化水平和工作能力。因此我们必须研究出解决干部和积极分子学习困难的有效的办法。
    解决干部和积极分子学习困难的有效办法，首先是要做到精简会议、减少兼职，同时还要求有计划地把他们的会议活动和学习的时间作合理的安排，以保证他们有一定的时间学习。在学习组织形式上，必须适合于干部的特点。对乡村主要干部大体上可以采取单独编班和脱离生产学习两种办法。单独编班，还要和个人自学、包教包学等方法相结合。在工作允许的条件下，分批抽调干部，脱离生产学习，是比较好的办法。这样可以集中时间采取速成识字法进行学习。这个办法目前只能限于乡的主要干部，抽调时间最好是在冬季。农村中一般干部和积极分子，一般可以同群众一起学习，如因工作或者开会缺课，可以事后由教师补课，如果有条件的也可考虑单独编班。解决干部、积极分子的学习困难问题，除上述一些办法以外，还要有各个组织上的保证，给予学习上的便利条件，并且应当加强督促和检查，遇到有思想障碍的时候就要适当地进行教育和鼓励。扫除党员干部的文盲，一定要党支部抓得紧，上级加强领导，本人学习的自觉性和积极性。
    三、开展农民业余文化教育必须依靠群众，坚
        持自愿的原则
    开展农民业余文化教育，必须坚持“以民教民”的原则，“主要是发动人民自己教育自己”。应当广泛动员识字的群众，教不识字的群众。那种想单靠政府聘用专职教师来进行扫除文盲的做法，是不切合实际的、行不通的。农民业余文化教育主要依靠群众教师利用业余时间担任教学，再配备少数专职教师作骨干，担任辅导工作。群众教师的来源，一个是历年受完扫除文盲识字教育的群众；另一个是从事农业生产的高小、初中毕业生及其他农村知识分子。
    贯彻“以民教民”的原则，必须同时注意群众教师的培养和提高的问题。对于群众教师必须大力加强政治思想领导，批判和克服他们对农民业余文化教育的消极情绪，教育他们安心和热爱自己的工作，培养他们为群众服务的光荣感。同时还要特别注意组织群众教师学习文化和业务，以提高他们的文化、业务水平。组织他们学习，最现实最有效的办法，是“结合教学实际”、“教啥学啥”、“缺啥补啥”，在平时可以采用教学研究小组、观摩教学、定期传授业务、短期训练等方式进行学习。其中教学研究小组收效较大，更应当成为今后培养和提高群众教师的主要方式。在冬学开办前，应当对冬学教师进行短期训练，训练内容以业务为主，使他们熟悉教材，明白教法。
    农民业余文化教育是一个广大的群众性的运动，它需要的费用不可能依赖政府解决，必须以群众自筹为原则，自筹办法可以由各地根据具体情况自行规定。目前有些农业生产合作社办民校，在公益金中拨出一部分作为民校的经费，对群众教师也按照他教学的时间，评工记分作为报酬。这些办法为今后妥善地解决冬学民校的经费问题，提出了一些有效的经验。
    动员农民参加学习，必须坚持自愿原则。我们应当在提高农民群众的思想觉悟的基础上，动员说服他们自觉自愿地参加学习。农业生产合作社办学同样也应当坚持自愿原则。任何强迫命令的作法，都要反对。
    四、教学方法必须适合于农民的特点，正确地
        贯彻“速成的联系实际的”教学方针
    首先，在识字教学方面，不看对象，不顾条件，机械地搬用速成识字法固然是不对的；但是根本否定速成识字法的长处的保守思想，也是错误的。近年来有些地区，根据速成识字法的精神，采用单元识字教学法，边突击边巩固，由于它更加适合于成人的特点，因而收效较好。这种教学方法上的改进，是值得重视的。今后各地应当根据具体情况，有条件采用速成识字法的，如某些地方的冬学，学习时间较长，又能集中学习，就可以采用速成识字法的基本精神来进行教学。没有条件的地方，就不要勉强采用速成识字法。采用普通教学法，也要适当吸收速成识字法的某些优点来改进教学。其次，在教学方法上必须紧密地联系实际，牢牢掌握“学以致用”的原则。有的农民业余学校除教识字课本外，还教了一些常用字（如种棉花的时候就教“棉花”二字），群众很欢迎这种办法。
    要充分发扬学习的自觉性和积极性。必须在自觉的基础上发挥刻苦好学的精神，只有这样才能学好。要教育农民，一要善于利用空闲学习；二要有“好问”的精神，不懂就要问人；三要有“恒心”，能长期坚持学习，反对冷热病。
    五、开展农民业余文化教育，必须依靠党委的领导加强农民业余文化教育组织领导的基本关键之一，在于紧紧地依靠各级党委的领导。开展这样规模巨大的群众性的文化教育工作，要完成扫除千百万文盲的历史任务，要是离开党的统一领导，那是决不可能实现的。已往的经验已经证明了，那些地区能取得党委的密切领导，那里的农民业余文化教育工作开展得就好，反过来就做不好。因此，我们必须紧紧地依靠党委的领导。我们必须及时地向党委请示，报告我们的工作，使党委把农民业余文化教育工作排入他们的议事日程里，在一定时期内检查、讨论这一工作，给我们以指导。
    开展农民业余文化教育工作，在各级党委和人民委员会的领导下，还必须同时妥善地解决机构和干部问题。因此应当根据精简原则，在教育部门内设置工农业余教育的机构，配备一定数量有工作能力的干部，来负责专管这项工作。
    扫除文盲是一件极其广泛的群众性的工作，要完成这一重大的历史任务，必须动员社会力量和群众力量，来协助政府开展扫除文盲运动。为此，可以学习苏联扫除文盲的经验，成立扫除文盲协会这样的组织。成立扫除文盲协会，广泛地动员社会力量和群众力量，协助政府开展扫除文盲运动，这对开展扫除文盲工作是必要的。但是目前我们在这方面还缺乏经验。因此应首先选择个别地区作试验，等取得一定经验后再逐步加以推广。
    要充分发动社会力量，还必须取得青年团、民主妇联、人民武装部门、农业生产合作社、文化馆（站）、科学普及协会等有关方面的大力支持和积极帮助。在这里应当特别强调的是依靠青年团的力量。根据苏联过去的经验，根据我国现在扫除文盲工作和扫除文盲后的巩固提高工作的经验来看，都充分说明了青年团是开展工农业余文化教育工作中的最有力的助手和支柱。因此我们必须依靠青年团的力量，同他们通力合作，共同把农民业余文化教育工作做好。
    在全国五亿农业人口中扫除文盲，并在扫除文盲的基础上不断地提高农民的文化水平，以适应建设社会主义社会的需要，这是一个长期的艰巨的光荣任务。我们一定要在党和政府的领导下，依靠全国人民的支持，本着上面所说的方针原则的精神，团结一心，为实现这个伟大的光荣的任务而努力奋斗。
