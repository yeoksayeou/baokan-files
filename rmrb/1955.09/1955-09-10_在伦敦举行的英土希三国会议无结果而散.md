    Xinhua News Agency, London: The foreign ministers of Britain, Turkey, and Greece began a conference in London on August 29 to discuss the political and military issues in the Eastern Mediterranean region, particularly the island of Cyprus. The conference announced its suspension on September 7 without achieving any results.

    The people of Cyprus were not represented at the London conference. A Cypriot delegation, elected by the All-Cyprus Conference to fight for self-determination for Cyprus, stated at a press conference in London on August 26 that the people of Cyprus unanimously do not recognize the London conference.

    At the London conference, the three governments expressed different opinions on the Cyprus issue. Britain was trying its best to maintain its rights over Cyprus, believing that the island was its main military base in the Eastern Mediterranean region; Greece supported the Cypriot residents' demand for self-determination, but it agreed that if Cyprus were incorporated into it, Britain could continue to maintain military bases there. Turkey advocated maintaining the status quo, saying that if Greece demanded Cyprus, then the Turkish government would demand the "return" of the island to Turkey.

    Due to the divergence of opinions among the three countries, the conference adjourned once on September 2. The three foreign ministers held individual talks during the adjournment, but these talks did not bring the positions of the parties closer.

    On September 6, the conference resumed. British Foreign Secretary Macmillan stated at the meeting that Britain was prepared to implement a colonial constitution in Cyprus, under which the residents of Cyprus would obtain so-called "autonomy." Greece opposed the British proposal, believing that the proposal did not stipulate the right of self-determination for the residents of Cyprus; Turkey also disagreed with the British proposal, opposing granting Cyprus "autonomy" before Greece guaranteed the annexation of Cyprus.

    The dispute over the Cyprus issue has worsened relations between Greece and Turkey. While the London conference was in progress, the Turkish consulate in Thessaloniki, Greece, was bombed, and anti-Greek incidents also occurred in Istanbul, Turkey.

    At the same time, Britain is stepping up measures to suppress the residents of Cyprus. On the 6th, more than 1,000 British troops conducted an unprecedented and largest-scale house-to-house search in the suburbs of Nicosia, during which a state of emergency was declared, and local residents were prohibited from leaving their homes. Meanwhile, according to the British Admiralty, more than 600 reinforcements had been dispatched from Malta to Cyprus.

    The residents of Cyprus continue to carry out activities against British rule. Leaflets are constantly being distributed in Nicosia, saying: "British, even if you send all the British troops here, you will not be able to suppress our liberation movement."

    在伦敦举行的英土希三国会议无结果而散
    据新华社讯　伦敦消息：英国、土耳其、希腊三国外交部长于八月二十九日开始在伦敦举行会议，讨论东地中海地区、特别是塞浦路斯岛的政治和军事问题。这个会议到九月七日，在没有取得任何结果的情况下，宣布停止举行。
    塞浦路斯人民没有代表参加伦敦会议。一个由全塞浦路斯会议选出的争取塞浦路斯自决的塞浦路斯代表团八月二十六日在伦敦记者招待会上说，塞浦路斯人民一致不承认伦敦会议。
    在伦敦会议上，三国政府对塞浦路斯问题表示了不同的意见。英国竭力要保持它对塞浦路斯的权利，认为这个岛屿是英国在地中海东部地区的主要军事基地；希腊支持塞浦路斯居民要求自决权的主张，不过它同意如果把塞浦路斯归并于它，可以让英国继续在那里保持军事基地，土耳其主张维持现状，它说，如果希腊要求塞浦路斯的话，那么土耳其政府就要求把这个岛屿“归还”土耳其。
    由于三国意见的分歧，会议一度在九月二日休会，三国外长在休会期间进行了个别会谈，但是这些会谈并没有使各方面的立场接近。
    九月六日，会议复会，英国外交大臣麦克米伦在会上表示英国准备在塞浦路斯实施殖民地宪法，塞浦路斯居民根据这个宪法将得到所谓“自治”。希腊反对英国建议，认为建议没有规定塞浦路斯居民的自决权；土耳其也不同意英国的建议，它反对在希腊不保证兼并塞浦路斯以前就给予塞浦路斯“自治”。
    塞浦路斯问题的争执使希腊同土耳其关系恶化。在伦敦会议进行期间，土耳其驻希腊萨罗尼加的领事馆被炸，土耳其的伊斯坦布尔也发生了反希腊事件。
    同时，英国正在加紧采取镇压塞浦路斯居民的措施。六日，英军一千多人在尼科西亚郊区进行了一次空前未有的最大规模的挨户搜查，在搜查时宣布了紧急状态，当地居民被禁止离开自己的家。同时，据英国海军部宣布，六百多名增援部队已由马耳他岛开往塞浦路斯。
    塞浦路斯居民继续进行反对英国统治的活动，在尼科西亚不断有人散发传单，传单上说：“英国人，你们即使把所有英国军队开到这里也镇压不了我们的解放运动。”
