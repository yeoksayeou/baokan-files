It is disclosed that when the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Gunnar Myrdal, spoke at the opening meeting of the committee, he pointed out that the recent improvement in the political atmosphere has led to the expansion of intra-European trade and has given rise to hopes for good prospects. He said that in the first half of 1955, the total trade volume between Eastern and Western European countries was 1,085 million US dollars, while in the first half of 1954, it was 927 million US dollars.

Myrdal requested the meeting representatives to demonstrate a spirit of cooperation to promote progress and realize the ideals of the "Geneva spirit". The meeting will be held until October 14.
