Zhejiang Establishes Schools on Islands Such as Nanjishan

After the liberation of Nanjishan, Beijishan Islands in Zhejiang Province, the residents on the islands requested the establishment of schools. Now, the Dongtou County People's Government has established four schools on the three islands of Nanjishan, Beijishan, and Beilong. When the children and parents heard the news about the establishment of schools on the islands, they were very happy. In just a few days, more than two hundred children signed up for school.

The residents on the islands, in order to run their own schools well, are busy repairing school buildings and purchasing school equipment. The masses in Kecai'ao Village, Beijishan Island, converted a public house into a school building, repaired and painted it, and built a new teacher's dormitory. The fishermen of the six mutual aid teams in this village all said: Establishing a school is a happy event, and we should care about it! The fishermen in Beilong Township are also busy building school buildings, some bringing thatch, some bringing Mao bamboo, and some contributing labor, striving to have the school buildings built before the start of school. Some of the tables and chairs on the island were burned by Chiang's bandit troops. Now, in order for their children to go to school, the fishermen are making them themselves using old wood. Many parents have specially gone to the mainland to purchase school supplies in order to ensure that their children can enroll on time. In order to run these schools well, the Culture and Education Section of the Dongtou County People's Government will send a group of excellent teachers to take on the teaching work.

    浙江在南麂山等岛上办学校
    浙江省南麂山、北麂山岛解放以后，岛上的居民纷纷要求创办学校。现在，洞头县人民政府已在南麂山、北麂山、北龙三个岛办了四所学校。孩子和家长们听到在岛上办学校的消息，都十分高兴，没有几天，就有二百多个孩子报名上学。
    岛上的居民为了办好自己的学校，正忙着为学校修理校舍和购置校具。北麂山岛壳菜岙村群众把一所公共房子改为校舍，并进行了修理粉刷，还新搭了一间教师寝室。这个村的六个渔业互助组的渔民都这样说：办学校是一件喜事，我们应该关心这件事！北龙乡的渔民也正忙着动手搭校舍，有的拿出芒草秆，有的拿出毛竹，有的出工，争取在开学前把校舍盖好。岛上的一些桌椅都被蒋贼军烧光了，现在，渔民们为了使自己的孩子们上学，就自己动手用旧木料来做。许多家长们为了使孩子按时入学，特地到大陆上购买学习用品。洞头县人民政府文教科为了办好这些学校，将派一批优秀教师前来担任教学工作。
