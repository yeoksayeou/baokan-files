Agricultural Production Cooperatives Achieve General Good Harvest

    Most Commune Members' Income Increased
    Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province have generally begun autumn harvest distribution work. Areas along the Yangtze River and around the lakes, where the season is earlier, have already carried out specific distributions; areas where the season is later are brewing and formulating preliminary distribution plans.
    In the process of formulating preliminary distribution plans, various localities have conscientiously implemented the distribution principle of "mainly based on labor, taking into account land," so that all commune members have obtained reasonable benefits. Generally, cooperatives have guaranteed that the income of more than 95% of commune members has increased. According to a survey of 147 households in six cooperatives, including Tongyi and Xinxing in Wuchang County, the income of 144 households increased, accounting for 98% of the total number of commune members. In the distribution, reasonable solutions were made to the issues of land yield, the distribution ratio of land labor, and the repayment of the price of cattle and farm tools when joining the cooperative. All of these have powerfully promoted the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives. In the past, the Jiang Yonghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huangmei County had five middle-peasant households requesting to withdraw from the cooperative due to unfair assessment of production. After this adjustment, they not only did not withdraw from the cooperative, but also produced more actively. The surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers have also applied to join the cooperative one after another. (Zuo Bin)

专栏：农业生产合作社普遍大丰收

    社员收入大部增加
    湖北省各地农业生产合作社，普遍开始秋收分配工作。季节早的沿江滨湖地区已进行具体分配；季节较晚的地区正酝酿制定预分方案。
    在制定预分方案过程中，各地认真贯彻了“以劳为主、兼顾土地”的分配原则，使全体社员都获得了合理利益。一般社都保证了百分之九十五以上的社员收入增加。据武昌县同益、新星等六个社一百四十七户社员调查，其中有一百四十四户社员增加了收入，占总社员数百分之九十八。在分配中，对入社土地产量、土地劳力分配比例以及入社耕牛农具价款偿还等问题都作了合理解决。这都有力地推动了农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。黄梅县姜永洪农业生产合作社原来由于评产不公，有五户中农要求退社，经过这次调整后，他们不但不退社，而更积极生产了。周围互助组和单干农民也都纷纷申请入社。（作宾）
