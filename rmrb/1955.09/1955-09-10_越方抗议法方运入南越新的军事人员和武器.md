Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 9th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on September 9th: The chief representative of the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army submitted a memorandum to the chief representative of the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces on September 5th, strongly protesting the French side's violation of the Geneva Accords by transporting new military personnel and weapons into South Vietnam.

The memorandum cites many instances of war materials being transported into South Vietnam since August 1954. For example, on March 25, 1955, an American aircraft carrier docked in Saigon, carrying many military liaison planes, helicopters, and jet engines for "Sabre" fighter planes. In May, the ships "Cambodge" and "Floride" unloaded a large amount of war materials for use by the air force and army in Saigon. In early July, the United States transported 30 of the latest L-19 reconnaissance aircraft into South Vietnam, which could be converted into light bombers.

The memorandum also points out that, in addition to the above-mentioned illegal reinforcements of weapons and war materials, the French Union Forces expanded military airports in Bien Hoa, Vung Tau, Nha Trang, Da Nang, etc. in May 1955, and built new military airports in Nha Ban, Chau Doc Province, etc. in June 1955.

The memorandum then describes the fact that the French Union Forces allowed a large number of foreign military personnel to enter South Vietnam illegally. The memorandum said that in addition to US General Collins and many US officers arriving in Saigon to train the Ngo Dinh Diem government's army and establishing a command structure led by General O'Daniel to effectively control military command in South Vietnam, many other foreign military personnel entered South Vietnam.

The memorandum points out that the purpose of foreign military personnel entering South Vietnam is to strengthen the military power of South Vietnam. Therefore, this is completely inconsistent with the Geneva Accords.

The memorandum emphasizes that all these actions show that the French Union Forces have seriously violated Articles 16, 17, 18, and 19 of the Geneva Accords, and violated Articles 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. These violations of the agreement, which occurred at the same time as the Ngo Dinh Diem government's refusal to hold consultative conferences, opposition to free general elections, and implementation of retaliation against former resistance personnel in South Vietnam, are part of a conspiracy to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords and turn South Vietnam into an American military base.

The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army finally strongly protested these violations of the agreement in the memorandum. It requested the General Command of the French Union Forces to ensure the cessation of such actions, respect the procedures for supervising the entry of weapons and military personnel into Vietnam, and notify the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army of the arrival and departure of all troops, military personnel, weapons, and ammunition entering and leaving South Vietnam since the Geneva Accords came into effect.

    越方抗议法方运入南越新的军事人员和武器
    新华社河内九日电　据越南通讯社九日讯：越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表在九月五日向法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团首席代表提出了一份备忘录，强烈抗议法方违反日内瓦协定，把新的军事人员和武器运入南越。
    备忘录举出从一九五四年八月以来许多作战物资被运入南越的事例。例如，在一九五五年三月二十五日，一艘美国航空母舰到西贡停泊，运进许多军用联络机、直升飞机和“佩刀式”飞机的喷气引擎。五月，“柬埔寨号”轮船和“佛罗里特号”轮船在西贡卸下大批供空军和陆军使用的战争物资。七月初，美国把三十架最新式的Ｌ十九型侦察机运入南越，这些飞机是可以改装成轻型轰炸机的。
    备忘录又指出，除了上述非法增援武器和战争物资的行为以外，法兰西联邦部队方面在一九五五年五月扩充了在边和、头顿、芽庄、岘港等地的军用机场，并且在一九五五年六月在朱笃省芽班等地建筑了新的军用机场。
    备忘录接着叙述了法兰西联邦部队方面容许大批外国军事人员非法进入南越的事实。备忘录说，除了美国将军柯林斯和许多美国军官到达西贡训练吴庭艳政府的陆军以及建立了由奥丹尼尔将军领导的指挥机构以便实际掌握南越的军事指挥权以外，还有许多外国军事人员进入南越。
    备忘录指出，外国军事人员进入南越的目的是加强南越的军事力量。因此，这是同日内瓦协定完全不相符合的。
    备忘录强调说，所有这些行动表明，法兰西联邦部队已经严重地违反了日内瓦协定第十六条、第十七条、第十八条和第十九条，违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言第四和第五条。同吴庭艳政府拒绝举行协商会议、反对举行自由普选、对南越前抗战人员实施报复同时发生的这些违反协定的行动，是破坏日内瓦协定的实施和把南越变成美国军事基地的阴谋的一部分。
    越南人民军总司令部代表团最后在备忘录中强烈抗议这些违反协定的行动。它要求法兰西联邦部队总司令部保证停止这类行动，尊重监督武器和军事人员进入越南的程序，并且把日内瓦协定生效以来出入南越的一切部队、军事人员、武器和弹药到达和离开的情况通知越南人民军总司令部代表团。
