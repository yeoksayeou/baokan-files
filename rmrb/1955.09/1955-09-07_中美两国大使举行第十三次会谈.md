　　The next meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, September 10.

    新华社日内瓦六日电　中美两国大使级会谈在六日上午当地时间十时到十二时二十五分在日内瓦国联大厦举行第十三次会议。
    在六日会议上，双方大使继续讨论了第一项议程——双方平民回国问题。王炳南大使把对方提出曾申请回国的十二名在华美侨的情况通知了约翰逊大使。
    在这十二名在华美侨中，芭莱、包霭德、黄贝德、派克、李克思夫妇、第该等七人已经结束了他们的未了案件，可以随时离境；最近提出申请的罗曼诺瓦母女也可以随时离境；马纳在清理了他的债务以后也可以随时离境；华里柱并没有提出离境申请，如果提出申请，可以随时离境；至于惠哲夫人，虽然由于荷兰政府声称她是荷兰人而没有被列入在华美侨的名单，但是假如她愿意的话，她也可以随时离境。
