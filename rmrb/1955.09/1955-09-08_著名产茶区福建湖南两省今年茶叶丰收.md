Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 7th: Fujian Province has had a generally good harvest of spring and summer tea, with production reaching the planned annual tea output. Tea farmers in the tea-producing areas are now continuing to harvest and process autumn tea, which will be completed by the end of September.

　　The new teas this year, such as the famous Minhong and Oolong teas, have been successively sold to European and Asian markets. The province plans to increase tea exports by 16 percent compared to last year.

　　Fujian Province is one of the main tea-producing areas in the country. During the tea-picking season, relevant departments promptly sent technical cadres to guide tea farmers in picking and processing. Many areas use tea rolling machines for tea production, so the quality of the tea is very good, clean, and hygienic. To facilitate tea farmers in selling tea, state-owned tea companies have added eight purchasing stations in various tea-producing areas and have also appropriately adjusted tea prices. So far, the Fujian Provincial Company of the China Tea Company has purchased 15 percent more tea than last year, overfulfilling the annual purchasing task.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 4th: Hunan Province has had a bumper tea harvest this year. According to statistics, the total output of spring tea, summer tea, and autumn tea reached more than 375,000 dan, exceeding the original production plan and increasing by more than 9 percent compared to last year. Farmers in various tea-producing areas have basically completed the autumn tea picking work, and workers in tea factories in Changsha, Pingjiang, Anhua and other places are busy processing and re-processing. Some have already started shipping out.

　　Hunan Province is a famous tea-producing area in the country, and its annual output of commercial tea accounts for one-sixth of the total commercial tea in the country. This year, tea farmers in various places, by changing the old habit of picking both old and young leaves together, implemented tender picking, batch picking, and improved preliminary processing technology, resulting in improved tea quality, and reduced stem and moisture content compared to previous years.

    著名产茶区福建湖南两省今年茶叶丰收
    新华社福州七日电　福建省春茶和夏茶普遍丰收，产量达到了全年茶叶的计划产量。现在茶区农民正继续采制秋茶，九月底可以结束。
    今年的新茶如著名的闽红、乌龙等茶类，已先后远销欧洲、亚洲市场。全省计划出口的茶叶比去年增加百分之十六。
    福建省是全国主要产茶区之一。在茶叶采摘季节，各有关部门及时派出技术干部，指导茶农采摘、加工。不少地区采用揉茶机制茶，因此茶叶品质很好，清洁卫生。为便利种茶农民出售茶叶，国营茶业公司在各茶区增设了八个收购站，还适当调整了茶价。到目前为止，中国茶业公司福建省公司已收购的茶叶比去年增加百分之十五，超额完成了全年的收购任务。
    新华社长沙四日电　湖南省今年茶叶丰收。据统计春茶、夏茶、秋茶总产量共达三十七万五千多担，超过原订生产计划，比去年增产百分之九多。现在各产茶区的农民已基本结束秋茶采摘工作，长沙、平江、安化等地制茶厂的工人正忙着加工复制，有一部分已经开始外运。
    湖南省是全国著名的产茶区，年产商品茶占全国商品茶总数六分之一。今年，各地植茶农民由于改变过去老嫩一齐采的习惯，实行嫩采、分批采摘和改进初制技术结果，茶叶质量都有提高，含梗和含水率也比往年降低。
