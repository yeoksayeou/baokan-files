    Promote Bamboo-Reinforced Concrete
    Zhang Youliang
    Bamboo-reinforced concrete is a concrete component made with bamboo poles or strips instead of steel reinforcing bars. The bamboo material should have a fine texture and tough skin; thin bamboo like tea-stick bamboo can be used whole, and thick bamboo like moso bamboo can be split for use.
    For mixed-structure dormitories, using bamboo-reinforced concrete for floors can save 36% to 45% of steel, and it is more than five yuan cheaper per square meter than using steel-reinforced concrete.
    Southern provinces in China abound in bamboo, with an annual output of about 150 million dan, of which moso bamboo, suitable for making bamboo-reinforced concrete, accounts for about 50%. Moreover, the productivity of moso bamboo is very high, and it can be used after growing for three or four years.
    As early as around 1933, Chinese experts researched bamboo-reinforced concrete. The use of bamboo-reinforced concrete structures has a history of thirty to forty years in Guangzhou. In the Dongshan District of Guangzhou, bamboo-reinforced concrete buildings are extremely common. Currently, there are two large-scale buildings in Guangzhou with verifiable dates: one is the Dongtian Teahouse, a three-and-a-half-story building with a roof and floors made of bamboo-reinforced concrete. This building was built in 1915 and is now forty years old. The other is the dormitory of the Seventh Middle School, a three-story building with floors made of cinder bamboo-reinforced concrete, which is now thirty-seven years old. After liberation, some bamboo-reinforced concrete buildings were also built, such as the 12,000-square-meter primary school classrooms, auditoriums, dormitories, and canteens built by the South China Military Region, with floors and roofs made of cinder bamboo-reinforced concrete.
    However, none of the above-mentioned buildings have undergone scientific calculations, and the bamboo reinforcement has not been treated for anti-corrosion or anti-insect purposes. For example, the bamboo-reinforced concrete roof of the Guangzhou Dongtian Teahouse has shown signs of corrosion because the bamboo reinforcement was not treated for anti-corrosion during construction, and the roof has cracks that allow water to seep in. It was not until last year, when the Guangzhou Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau conducted tests on bamboo-reinforced concrete, carried out scientific structural calculations, and treated the bamboo reinforcement for waterproofing and anti-corrosion, that it built an experimental institute and a sanatorium, and the application of bamboo-reinforced concrete entered a new stage.
    In order to further research and promote bamboo-reinforced concrete, the Ministry of Construction Engineering convened a bamboo-reinforced concrete technology conference from August 15th to 17th, discussing the applicable scope of bamboo-reinforced concrete, the types of bamboo and treatment methods, and other issues, exchanged experiences, and initially affirmed that bamboo-reinforced concrete can be used for floors, door and window frames, and gutter covers in civil buildings. The conference also decided to further study the anti-corrosion, waterproofing, and anti-insect treatment of bamboo, the processing of bamboo, and the applicable scope of bamboo-reinforced concrete.

    推广竹筋混凝土
    张友谅
    竹筋混凝土是用竹竿或竹条代替钢筋制成的混凝土构件。这种竹材要肉质细密，表皮坚韧；细的如茶杆竹可以整根用，粗的如毛竹可以劈开来用。
    混合结构的宿舍，用竹筋混凝土做楼板，可以节省百分之三十六到百分之四十五的钢材，每平方公尺比用钢筋混凝土便宜五元多。
    我国南方各省盛产竹材，全国年产量约一万五千万担，其中适宜做竹筋混凝土的毛竹约占百分之五十，而且毛竹的生产率很高，生长三四年就能使用。
    大约在一九三三年，我国就有专家研究竹筋混凝土。使用竹筋混凝土结构，在广州已有三四十年历史，广州市东山区内，竹筋混凝土的建筑物极为普遍。目前在广州市有确实年代可考，并且规模较大的建筑物有两座，一座是洞天茶楼，这是一座三层半的楼房，屋面和楼板都是竹筋混凝土做的。这座楼修建于一九一五年，至今已四十年。另一座是第七中学学生宿舍，是三层楼房，楼板是用煤渣竹筋混凝土做的，至今已有三十七年。解放后，也修了一些竹筋混凝土建筑物，如华南军区建了一万二千平方公尺的子弟小学教室、礼堂、宿舍和食堂，楼板和屋面都是用煤渣竹筋混凝土做的。
    不过，上面所说的这些建筑物，都没有进行过科学的计算，对竹筋也没有做过防腐防虫处理。像广州洞天茶楼的竹筋混凝土屋面，因为施工时没有对竹筋作防腐处理，同时屋面有裂缝浸水，竹筋已有腐蚀现象。直到去年，广州市建筑工程局为了进行竹筋混凝土的试验，经过科学的结构计算和对竹筋做了防水和防腐处理，修建了一座试验所和一座疗养所，竹筋混凝土的应用才进入了一个新的阶段。
    为了进一步研究和推广竹筋混凝土，建筑工程部在八月十五日到十七日召开了竹筋混凝土技术会议，讨论了竹筋混凝土的适用范围、竹筋的种类和处理方法等许多问题，交流了经验，并初步肯定：民用建筑的楼板、门窗框、阴沟盖，都可以使用竹筋凝混土，会议并决定对竹材的防腐、防水、防虫处理，竹材的加工以及竹筋混凝土的适用范围作进一步研究。
