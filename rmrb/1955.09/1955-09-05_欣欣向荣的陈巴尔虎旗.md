The Chen Barag Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been liberated for ten years. In these ten years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of Chen Barag Banner have experienced an extraordinary historical period: feudal privileges were abolished in pastoral areas, various social democratic reforms were carried out, the people took control of the government and became the masters of the grasslands; animal husbandry developed, and those who had no livestock acquired livestock; schistosomiasis control work was carried out, and those who had no children had children; literacy campaigns were launched, and those who had no culture acquired culture. The people began a life of freedom and happiness.

Recalling the early days of liberation, the entire banner had only over 13,000 head of livestock left. Today, the people of the entire banner own more than 130,000 head of livestock. In ten years, the livestock of the entire banner has increased tenfold, averaging more than twenty head of livestock per person.

The rapid increase in livestock is inseparable from the vigorous support of the Party and the People's Government. From 1949 to 1954, the People's Government provided herdsmen with over 200,000 yuan in pastoral loans and over 10,000 head of livestock, and implemented a light tax policy, which strongly supported the development of animal husbandry production. In addition, it vigorously organized herdsmen to fight against natural disasters, gradually establishing the idea that "man can conquer nature." Now all livestock have pens, and most young and weak livestock have warm sheds in winter and spring.

The People's Government has also trained a large number of veterinary workers who go deep into pastoral areas to prevent and control livestock diseases for herdsmen. In the past, diseases such as rinderpest, anthrax, sheep pox, and bovine pleuropneumonia, which herdsmen considered incurable and caused the death of large numbers of livestock, can now be controlled. From 1950 to 1954, the number of livestock that underwent various preventive inoculations in the banner reached more than 247,000 head-times, which is almost equivalent to an average of two inoculations for each head of livestock in the banner.

The old society left the herdsmen with two major disasters: poverty and disease. Therefore, while developing animal husbandry production and improving people's lives, it is also necessary to improve people's health and increase the population. Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have sent a large number of medical workers to go deep into pastoral areas to carry out various medical and health work. In 1950, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government sent a venereal disease prevention and control team to Wanggong Sumu in Chen Barag Banner to carry out a pilot project for schistosomiasis control. Immediately afterwards, a general treatment for syphilis was carried out among the herdsmen of the entire banner. Since 1953, the schistosomiasis control team has been using advanced Soviet therapies to carry out radical treatment among the herdsmen of Chen Barag Banner. Many herdsmen who used to suffer from lower back and leg pain due to syphilis no longer have pain, many people whose eyes were damaged by syphilis have regained their sight, and many women who had not had children for many years have given birth to chubby babies.

While carrying out schistosomiasis control work, maternal and child health work was also carried out. Now the banner and sumu have maternal and child health stations, and each baga has new-style midwives. Thirty-four new-style midwives trained from the herdsmen are distributed in seventeen bagas. Now many women use new-style delivery methods, which greatly reduces the infant mortality rate. The pastoral population, which had been declining, has begun to rise. Since 1950, the population of Chen Barag Banner has been rising every year. Last year, Wanggong, Wuzhuer, and Tenihe Sumu together increased by eighty-eight people.

    欣欣向荣的陈巴尔虎旗
    阿拉坦
    内蒙古自治区陈巴尔虎旗解放十年了。在这十年当中，陈巴尔虎旗的人民在共产党的领导下，经历了一段极不平凡的历史时期：在牧区废除了封建特权，进行了各种社会民主改革，人民掌握了政权，当了草原的主人；发展了畜牧业，没有牲畜的人有了牲畜；进行了驱梅工作，没有孩子的有了孩子；开展了识字运动，没有文化的有了文化。人民开始了自由幸福的生活。
    回想解放初期，全旗只剩下了一万三千多头牲畜，而今天，全旗人民已拥有十三万多头牲畜了，十年间全旗牲畜增加了十倍，平均每人有二十多头牲畜。
    牲畜的迅速增加是同党和人民政府的大力扶助分不开的。从一九四九年到一九五四年，人民政府给牧民贷放了二十来万元的牧业贷款和一万来头牲畜，并施行轻税政策，有力地扶助了畜牧业生产的发展。此外并大力组织牧民同自然灾害进行斗争，使牧民逐渐树立了“人定胜天”的思想。现在所有的牲畜都有了圈，在冬春两季大部分幼畜和瘦弱牲畜都有暖棚。
    人民政府还培养了大批兽医工作人员，深入牧区为牧民的牲畜防治疫病。过去牧民认为不可治而造成大批牲畜死亡的牛瘟、炭疽、羊痘、牛肺疫等疫病，现在已能控制了。从一九五零年到一九五四年全旗进行各种预防注射的牲畜数达二十四万七千多头次，这差不多等于给全旗每头牲畜平均进行了两次注射。
    旧社会给牧民遗留下的是贫、病两大灾难。因此，在发展畜牧业生产、改善人民生活的同时，还必须提高人民健康水平和增加人口。解放以来党和人民政府派遣大批医务工作人员，深入牧区开展各项医疗卫生工作。一九五零年内蒙古自治区人民政府派性病防治工作队，到陈巴尔虎旗完工苏木进行驱梅试点工作，紧接着在全旗牧民中普遍治疗了一次梅毒。一九五三年起，驱梅队又在陈巴尔虎旗牧民中，用苏联的先进疗法开始进行根治工作。许多过去因患梅毒腰腿痛的牧民已经不痛了，许多人因梅毒坏了的眼睛已经复明了，也有不少的多年没生过孩子的妇女抱上了胖娃娃。
    在进行驱梅工作的同时，还开展了妇幼卫生工作。现在旗和苏木都设有妇幼保健站，各巴嘎有新法接生员。从牧民中培养出来的三十四名新法接生员分布在十七个巴嘎里。现在许多妇女用新法接生，大大减少了婴儿死亡率。过去一直是下降的牧区人口已开始上升。从一九五零年以来陈巴尔虎旗人口每年都在上升。去年完工、乌珠尔、特尼河三个苏木共增加了八十八人。
