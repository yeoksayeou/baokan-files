　　Autumn Crop Harvests Expected Across the Country
　　(Our Dispatch) This year, a bumper harvest of autumn crops is expected across the country.
　　In rice-growing areas, early rice has been harvested, and intermediate rice is being harvested successively, with some areas already completed. This year, except for Guangdong and Guangxi, which experienced reduced production due to drought, major rice-producing provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan have all achieved comprehensive bumper harvests of early and intermediate rice. In Hunan Province, the average yield of early rice throughout the province is 450 to 500 jin per mu, and intermediate rice is around 500 jin. In areas such as Liling, Liuyang, Xiangyin, and Wangcheng, the yield per mu is generally above 500 jin, with some reaching around 700 jin. In Hubei Province, early rice production increased by 10% compared to the bumper year of 1953, and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area may increase by 20% to 30%. Mianyang County, which suffered severe waterlogging, can still produce more than 350 jin per mu. In Yangzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, the average yield of intermediate rice per mu is 400 to 420 jin, an increase of more than 25% compared to 1954, and more than 10% compared to the bumper year of 1953. The 2.48 million mu of double-cropping rice planted this year in Anhui Province yielded an average of more than 400 jin of early rice per mu, an increase of more than 50% compared to 1954. More than 3 million mu of early and intermediate rice in Jinhua Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, also reported a general bumper harvest. In Xinjiang Province, the famous rice-producing area of ​​Aksu Prefecture, with more than 230,000 mu of rice, is estimated to exceed the bumper harvest level of an average of 360 jin per mu in 1954. In order to strive for an extra harvest, some provinces have also expanded the area of ​​late autumn crops, and the area of ​​late rice has also increased. At present, rainfall is even in most areas, and late rice is growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected.
　　In major coarse grain areas across the country, except for northern Shaanxi and northwestern Shanxi, which experienced reduced production due to drought, and some areas of Henan, where production was slightly affected by floods, coarse grain crops in Hebei, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Anhui, and northern Jiangsu can all achieve bumper harvests. The autumn crop growth in Hebei Province is generally better than in 1954 and is expected to exceed the planned output. Zhaoli Village in Tongxian County estimates that this year's dryland corn can produce 300 jin, and low-lying land can reach 600 jin. The 135,000 mu of spring corn in Dingxian County has generally achieved a bumper harvest, an increase of 2 million jin compared to the plan. In Jining Prefecture, Shandong Province, sorghum yielded 200 jin per mu in 1954, and this year's yield is 300 jin per mu, with some reaching 500 jin. Corn in Jiaozhou Prefecture also increased by 10% to 20% compared to 1954. If there are no unexpected disasters, the output of more than 17 million mu of sweet potatoes in Shandong Province can be converted into more than 6 billion jin of grain (four jin of sweet potatoes converted into one jin of grain). The average yield of sorghum in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, is estimated to be 130 jin per mu, exceeding the plan by 12.5 jin, and 7.5 jin more than in 1953. Some agricultural production cooperatives have sorghum yields as high as 300 jin per mu. Heilongjiang Province's 75 million mu of coarse grain crops such as corn, millet, soybeans, and sorghum can approach the bumper harvest level of 1952. Corn in Xinjiang Province has already turned yellow, and the 810,000 mu of corn in Hotan Prefecture under the Kunlun Mountains will exceed the original plan by 11% per mu.
　　At present, most parts of the country are showing a scene of bumper harvest. However, some autumn crops are still some time away from harvest, and the threat of natural disasters such as water, drought, and early frost still exists. Farmers in various places are actively strengthening field management in the later stages to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest.

    各地秋季作物丰收在望
    本报讯　今年全国各地秋季作物丰收在望。
    各水稻地区的早稻已收割完毕，中稻正在陆续收割，部分地区已收割完毕。今年除广东、广西因旱减产外，江西、湖南、湖北、安徽、江苏、浙江、四川、贵州、云南等主要产稻省份的早、中稻都全面获得丰收。湖南省今年全省早稻平均每亩产四百五十斤至五百斤，中稻在五百斤左右。醴陵、浏阳、湘阴、望城等地区每亩产量一般都在五百斤以上，高的达七百斤左右。湖北省早稻比丰收的一九五三年增产一成，荆江分洪区可增产二至三成。渍水较重的沔阳县每亩也可产三百五十斤以上。江苏省扬州专区中稻每亩平均产量为四百到四百二十斤，比一九五四年增产二成半以上，比丰收的一九五三年还增产一成多。安徽省今年改种的二百四十八万亩双季稻，早稻每亩平均产量为四百多斤，比一九五四年增产五成以上。浙江省金华专区三百多万亩早、中稻也普告丰收。在新疆省，著名的水稻产区阿克苏专区二十三万多亩水稻，估计可超过一九五四年平均每亩收三百六十斤的丰收水平。为了争取多收一季，有些省还扩大了晚秋面积，晚稻面积也有增加。目前大部地区雨水调匀，晚稻生长良好，可望丰收。
    全国主要杂粮地区除陕北、晋西北因旱减产及河南部分地区因水灾产量稍受影响外，河北、山东、黑龙江、吉林、安徽和苏北等地杂粮作物都可丰收。河北省秋季作物生长一般比一九五四年好，估计将超过计划产量。通县一区召里村今年估计旱地玉米可产三百斤，洼地可达六百斤。定县十三万五千亩的春玉米普遍丰收，比计划增产二百万斤。山东省济宁专区一九五四年高粱每亩收二百斤，今年每亩收三百斤，好的达五百斤。胶州专区的玉米也比一九五四年增产一、二成。如无意外灾害，山东省一千七百余万亩甘薯的产量可折合粮食（四斤薯类折一斤粮食）六十余亿斤。安徽省阜阳专区的高粱估计每亩平均产量为一百三十斤，超过计划十二斤半，比一九五三年多收七斤半。有些农业生产合作社的高粱，每亩产量高达三百斤。黑龙江省七千五百万亩玉米、谷子、大豆、高粱等杂粮作物，可接近一九五二年的丰收水平。新疆省玉米已经黄熟，昆仑山下和阗专区的八十一万多亩玉米，每亩产量将超过原计划百分之十一。
    目前，全国绝大部分地区呈现一片丰收景象。但部分秋作物距收获还有一段时间，水、旱、早霜等自然灾害的威胁还存在，各地农民正积极加强后期的田间管理，争取全面大丰收。
