    In today's environment where new opera creation is not yet flourishing, the premiere of "Song of the Grassland" is an exciting event.
    From the performance of "Song of the Grassland," we sensed the beautiful and vast grassland atmosphere; saw the lovely characters living on the grassland, possessing diligence, a robust quality, and a brave, forthright character; and understood that the grassland is to them as air is to life. In the past, the reactionary rulers used the ownership of the grassland to divide and incite the minority nationalities, causing internecine feuds between tribes, in order to carry out more cruel oppression and exploitation against them. On the other hand, they also propagated that they were all ignorant, savage, bloodthirsty, and bellicose. "Song of the Grassland" clearly tells us that the Tibetan brothers living on the grassland are just like us, loving peace and hoping to live a good life. From the expressions of several young people—Abuzha, Nongcuojia, and Zhuoma—in the first act, we can hear how eagerly they hope that the old Red Army, which they heard from the elders had been to the grassland ten years ago, can return soon so that the Tibetans can live a good life. In the second act, we see more clearly that when Duoriji, the headman of the Bazha tribe, ordered everyone to go to the Jida tribe to steal the horses back, the emotion shown by the people was not elation, but grief and depression. Old Zhe, whose eldest son had already been sacrificed in the feud, dared to dissuade his youngest son, Abuzha, from sacrificing himself again.
      As the central figures of the entire opera, Abuzha and Nongcuojia have been steadfastly in love with each other from beginning to end, without the slightest wavering due to the feud between the two tribes. Because they clearly understand: "We are human, and they are also human. Everyone works hard to live a good life, why should we fight...?" Therefore, in the fourth act, when Nongcuojia is imprisoned by the headman for releasing Abuzha, her close companion—Zhuoma—braves the difficulties to help her escape from prison to find Abuzha; in the fifth act, the two tribes have reconciled. These passionate and moving scenes all illustrate that the Tibetan brothers love peace and hope to live a happy and fulfilling life; but this can only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The playwright's central idea is clear. The director also grasped this point and expressed it more concretely through stage action.
    In the whole opera, the scenes from Act Three, Scene Two, where Abuzha is arrested and Nongcuojia releases him, to Act Four, Scene Two, where Tumu and Nongcuojia's siblings meet, are more prominent and complete. We can feel the inner activities of the characters, the actions are full of drama, and the structure of the drama and music is very tight, coherent from beginning to end, which is very in line with the requirements of opera and leaves a deeper impression. From this, we can also see the director's talent in handling opera.
    The music of "Song of the Grassland," generally speaking, has a Tibetan national style. Because the composers went deep into the Tibetan autonomous region of Gansu Province to experience life, using many Tibetan folk songs and mountain songs as creative material, many beautiful and moving melodies with national characteristics appeared in the opera. For example, the solo of the "Overture" at the beginning makes us feel the vast and open grassland atmosphere. Listening to "No girl can compare to my Nongcuojia" sung by Abuzha behind the curtain before he appears in the first act, we seem to see a brave young man on that boundless grassland, riding a valiant steed, singing heartily, and running like the wind to meet his lover. If the composer did not have the experience of grassland life and the understanding of the brave and forthright character of the people on the grassland, he would not be able to write such vivid music. Other more bright, healthy, and beautiful lyrical melodies are helpful in shaping the brave, optimistic, and strong personalities of Abuzha and Nongcuojia, who are the central figures of the opera.
    The most impressive, and also the most prominent in the entire opera, is the scene in the first act where Gaiba, the headman of the Jida tribe, obtains the "Grassland Ownership Certificate" for "Bitter Seashore" from the reactionary Liu Section Chief, and someone reports to him that the Bazha tribe's horses have run across the river. He looks at the "Grassland Ownership Certificate" in his hand, confidently orders everyone to drive the horses that have run across the river into their own herd, and at this time, a strong theme appears in the orchestra. It is heart-wrenching and reminds everyone that the conflict between the two tribes has begun. This theme develops into Nongcuojia's "Aria" - "There are many hardships in Bitter Seashore" and Abuzha and Nongcuojia's duet "When will we see a sunny day" after Wan Laogong is injured in the third act, scene two; later it is played by the chorus and the orchestra to express the development of the conflict. As soon as it appears, it reminds people of the root cause of the conflict—the division and incitement of the reactionary rulers. The composer's treatment method is more profound in thought and outstanding in creative development. This piece of music expresses the people's desire for a peaceful and beautiful life, and when this desire cannot be realized, it produces a sense of oppression; but there is no sense of depression or despair. It contains a deep potential force, which profoundly expresses the thoughts and feelings of the people on the grassland who yearn for a peaceful and beautiful life. Its melody is also unforgettable.
    In this performance, the orchestra played a significant role in describing the scene and rendering the atmosphere. For example, in the horse snatching in the first act, although there is no horse snatching action on the stage, the music makes people feel that the horses are being driven around wildly in confusion. In the second scene of the third act, the Bazha people's night raid, and in the first scene of the fourth act, Alima comes at night to rescue Nongcuojia from prison, the music makes people breathe the air of the night. Before Caida appears in the second scene of the fourth act, a phrase from the "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" appears in the music, foreshadowing the entry of the People's Liberation Army into the grassland. The heroic image of Caida immediately appears on the hillside, and the music here gains a strong dramatic effect.
    In terms of singing technique, the overall performance is better than past opera performances. The voices of the general actors have been quite well trained, the range is wide, and the expressiveness is enhanced. In terms of musical form, some choruses are used according to the needs of the plot development, which not only strengthens the expressiveness of the content but also enriches the color of the opera.
    The scenery and lighting of "Song of the Grassland" are unanimously considered by the audience to have new creations and are a step forward compared to the past. We cannot but thank the influence of the performance by the Soviet State Moscow Musical Theatre in Beijing.
    The performance of "Song of the Grassland" showed some progress in new opera in some creations. However, it should be said that it still has many shortcomings.
      In terms of the script, the author expresses through the form of opera the situation of the fraternal nationalities being liberated from the dark suffering and moving towards a bright and happy life path under the leadership of the Communist Party. This intention and the positive significance of the script should be affirmed. However, the author only uses two "Grassland Ownership Certificates" from the reactionary rulers as a means and cause for the intensification of the conflict between the two tribes, which makes it seem that the fraternal nationalities are too easily deceived. Would it be a secret matter that two neighboring tribes received the same "Grassland Ownership Certificate" almost at the same time? Since the cause of the intensified conflict is simple, the solution to the conflict is also very easy; as soon as the People's Liberation Army arrives, after a few words, the past grievances are all eliminated by comparing the two "Grassland Ownership Certificates." This simplifies the problem between the tribes. In fact, there are many reasons for the conflicts between tribes, and it will not be so easy to solve them. This is because the author has not delved deep enough into real life, or is not good at handling the intricate problems between tribes well, and simply solves them.
      The audience felt that the script was lengthy. This is because the author is unwilling to abandon some minor or unnecessary plots, and the director has not been able to boldly give appropriate arrangements, so as to reduce the characteristics of the opera - refinement and concentration. At the same time, in expressing the thoughts and feelings of the characters, the author used too much narration and description, such as spring breeze, butterflies, orioles, cuckoos, high mountains, flowing water... However, not enough effort has been put into directly and profoundly conveying the true inner feelings of the characters to the audience with poetic language, so that people can breathe with the characters in the opera.
    In terms of the main characters, although Abuzha and Nongcuojia are prominently portrayed, there are still contradictions in these characters with their true heroic character. For example, Nongcuojia heartlessly abandons her father, who raised her from the age of three and depends on her for life, who is still bleeding after being accidentally injured by Abuzha for love; this is a bit inhumane. Abuzha is the representative of the new force, but his attitude towards the tribal feud is vague. For example, in the second act, after the headman of the Bazha tribe issued the order to snatch the horses, Abuzha sang to his father, who did not want him to participate in the feud: "Pray for me, bless me, I will come back alive, with my lover, riding the stolen horse, singing the song of victory to see you, old man." This is completely the posture of a conqueror; the contradiction between the tribal feud and love seems not to exist in him. Therefore, the ideology of this heroic character is reduced. And Wan Laogong, who is called the old hero, although he let his son join the Red Army ten years ago, and his daughter's love and the tribal feud also make him contradictory, but we can't see his clearer attitude towards the feud, what is his heroic behavior? The audience can't see it either. Therefore, this old hero did not leave any impression in people's minds.
    What makes people feel insufficient about the music of "Song of the Grassland" is that it lacks a distinct personality in shaping the musical image of the characters. Because opera music not only has to express the inner activities and changes in thoughts and feelings of the characters in the prescribed situation due to the attitude towards different people and things, but more importantly, it must have a distinct personality when shaping the musical image of the characters. Otherwise, it will not meet the requirements of deeply expressing the essence of life. The composers of "Song of the Grassland" also consciously portrayed the characters' personalities. For example, in the musical images of Abuzha and Nongcuojia, who are the central figures of the whole opera, there are many healthy, bright, and beautiful melodies, but this only shows the brave and youthful side of these two characters, and it is not enough to describe their psychological state more deeply and express their thoughts and feelings more delicately. Therefore, although many beautiful and moving melodies have appeared, there are not many that can leave a deep impression—music that can express the inner thoughts and activities of typical characters in a typical environment. This is because the composers have not delved deep enough into the essence of life and lack a deeper understanding, mastery, and expression ability of the characters' personalities.
    In terms of the orchestra, although it is richer than the past new operas, it is still not delicate and profound enough, and the use of harmony cannot give more changes with the development of the plot; therefore, the color is not rich enough and appears somewhat monotonous. Especially when the People's Liberation Army entered the grassland in the second scene of the fourth act, this is the turning point in the development of the whole opera, and it also shows that the life of the people on the grassland has undergone a major change from then on. Therefore, when the red flag symbolizing the happy life of the fraternal nationalities appears on the high mountain slope, it is required to appear with music that is completely different from before, that can display the new look of life and introduce the audience, whose emotions have been excited, into a higher emotion. However, the music at this time seems weak and does not achieve the desired effect, which affects the emotions of the later scenes and cannot provoke a more enthusiastic climax.
    In this performance, many viewers felt that they could not hear the lyrics clearly. On the one hand, this is because the composers did not arrange the stress of some words well in accordance with the laws of Chinese language - tone and intonation. At the same time, not enough attention was paid to the four tones of the words; in this way, it sounds different from the original meaning and is difficult to understand. Another important reason is that some actors do not understand that singing in opera is different from ordinary singing; there is a considerable distance between the actors and the audience, especially when singing Chinese pinyin single words, if the consonants are not pronounced clearly, it will pass in a flash, and the audience will only hear the long and loud vowels; at the same time, many actors often use fixed mouth shapes to sing vowels, which makes it very difficult to hear what the singer is singing. One of the reasons why our many traditional Chinese opera music is loved by the masses is that their singing can make every word clear. I think this is worth learning and researching for new opera actors.
    The playwrights and composers of "Song of the Grassland" are all young writers, and they do not have very rich experience in creating such a large-scale opera. It is not easy to have such achievements now. We welcome its performance. We hope that the authors will learn from this creation and strive to create more successful works.

    评新歌剧“草原之歌”的演出
    舒模
    编剧：任萍作曲：罗宗贤、卓明理、金正平导演：刘郁民中央实验歌剧院演出
    在新歌剧创作还不够蓬勃的今天，“草原之歌”的上演，是令人兴奋的事。
    从“草原之歌”的演出中，我们感到了美丽辽阔的草原气息；看到了生活在草原上的，具有勤劳、浑厚品质和勇敢、爽朗性格的可爱的人物形象；了解到草地同他们的关系如同空气和生命的关系一样。过去的反动统治者就利用草地的占有
  权来对少数民族进行分化挑拨，造成部落间的自相仇杀，以便对他们进行更残酷的压榨和剥削。另一方面又宣传他们都是愚昧，野蛮，嗜杀好斗的。“草原之歌”明确地告诉了我们，生活在草原上的藏族兄弟，是和我们一样热爱和平、希望过美好生活的。从第一幕几个年轻人——阿布扎、侬错加、卓玛的倾诉中，就可以听到他们是多么热烈地盼望从老年人那里听来的，十年以前曾经到过草地的老红军能够早早地回来，好让藏民能够过好光景。在第二幕里，我们更明显地看到；当巴扎部落头人多日吉命令大伙出发到吉达部落把马抢回来的时候，人们表现出来的情绪并不是兴高采烈，而是悲痛和抑郁，由于仇杀已经牺牲了大儿子的老哲，已敢于劝阻自己的小儿子阿布扎，不愿他再去牺牲。
      作为全剧中心人物的阿布扎和侬错加，他们自始至终是坚贞不移地相互热爱着，并未因两个部落的仇杀而有丝毫的动摇。因为他们清楚地了解：“我们是人，他们也是人，大家勤苦过光景，为什么要打冤家……？”所以在第四幕中当侬错加因释放了阿布扎被头人关在牢里的时候，她的亲密伙伴——卓玛就不避艰险帮助她逃出监牢去找阿布扎；在第五幕中两个部落已经重归于好。这些热烈动人的场面，都说明了藏族兄弟是热爱和平，希望过美好幸福的生活的；但这只有在共产党和毛主席领导下才能实现。剧作者的中心思想是明确的。导演也掌握住了这一点，通过舞台动作，把它更具体地表现了出来。
    全剧中以三幕二场阿布扎被捕到侬错加把他释放，和四幕二场土木关上才达和侬错加兄妹会见这两场戏较突出、完整。我们能够感觉到人物的内心活动，动作富于戏剧性，剧和音乐的结构非常严紧，自始至终一气呵成，很符合歌剧的要求，给人的印象也较深刻。从这里也可以看出导演处理歌剧的才能。
    “草原之歌”的音乐，一般的说，是具有西藏民族风格的。由于作曲者曾深入到甘肃省的藏族自治区去体验生活，用很多藏族民歌和山歌来做创作素材，所以剧中出现了不少具有民族色彩的美丽动听的曲调。如一开场“序歌”的独唱，使我们感受到辽阔、开朗的草原气息。听着第一幕阿布扎出场前在幕后唱的“姑娘里谁也比不上我的侬错加”，我们好像看到那一望无际的草原上，一个勇敢年轻的小伙子，骑着一匹骠悍的骏马，纵情地高唱，飞也似地跑来会见他的爱人。如果作曲者没有草原生活的体会和对草原上人们勇敢、爽朗性格的了解，他是不可能写出这样生动的音乐的。其他更多明朗、健康而优美的抒情曲调，对于塑造作为剧的中心人物的阿布扎和侬错加这两个青年的勇敢、乐观和坚强的性格的一面，是有不少帮助的。
    给人印象最深，也是全剧音乐最突出的，是第一幕吉达部落头人盖巴从反动派的刘科长手里得到了“苦海滩”的“草原所有证”后，有人报告他巴扎部落的马群跑过河来了的场面。他看看手里的“草原所有证”，胸有成竹地命令大家把跑过河来的马赶到自己的马群里去，这时乐队里出现了一个强烈的主题，它震人心弦，提示大家：两个部落的矛盾开始了。这个主题到三幕二场，发展成万老公布受伤后，侬错加的“咏叹调”——“苦海滩里苦难多”和阿布扎和侬错加齐唱的“何时才能见晴天”；后来又用合唱和乐队奏出，用以表现矛盾的发展。它一出现，就使人想到了矛盾的根源——反动统治者的分化挑拨。作曲者这样的处理方法是有较深刻的思想性和突出的创造发挥的。这段音乐表现了人民对和平美好生活的愿望，而当这愿望不能实现的时候，就产生了压抑的情绪；但是丝毫没有消沉、绝望之感。它蕴藏着一种深厚的潜在的力量，它是深刻地表达了向往和平美好生活的草原上人们的思想情感的。它的曲调也是令人久久不忘的。
    在这次演出中，管弦乐在描写情景和渲染气氛方面发挥了不少作用。如第一幕的抢马，虽然舞台上并没有抢马的动作，从音乐中却使人感到马群在混乱中被赶着四处狂奔。三幕二场巴扎人黑夜偷袭和四幕一场阿里玛夜晚来救侬错加出监牢，音乐都使人呼吸到夜的气息。四幕二场才达出场之前，音乐中出现了“中国人民解放军进行曲”中的一个乐句，预示解放军进入草原了，瞬间那具有英雄形象的才达即在山坡上出现，音乐在这里获得了较强烈的戏剧效果。
    在演唱技术方面，整个说来，较过去的歌剧演出有所提高。一般演员的声音都经过相当训练，音域宽，表现力加强了。在乐曲形式上，根据剧情发展的需要，采用了一些重唱，这不仅加强了对内容的表现力，使歌剧的色彩也更丰富了。
    “草原之歌”的布景、灯光，被观众一致认为有新的创造，比过去进了一步。这不能不感谢苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院来北京演出所给予的影响。
    “草原之歌”的演出，在某些创作上显示了新歌剧的一些进展。但是，应该说，它仍有不少缺点。
      在剧本方面，作者通过歌剧形式，将兄弟民族从黑暗的苦难中，由于共产党的领导而获得解放，走向光明幸福的生活道路的情况表现出来，这种意图和剧本所产生的积极意义是应该肯定的。但是作者仅仅以反动统治者用两张“草原所有证”做为造成两个部落矛盾尖锐化的手段和原因，这就显得兄弟民族似乎太容易受骗了。两个邻近的部落，几乎是同时得到相同的“草原所有证”，难道会是件秘密的事么？造成矛盾尖锐化的原因既然简单，所以解决矛盾也就很轻易；解放军一到，几句话一说，两张“草原所有证”一对证，过去的冤仇全消了。这是将部落间的问题简单化了。事实上，造成部落间的矛盾的原因是很多的，解决起来也不会这么容易，这是由于作者对现实生活挖掘得还不够深，或者是对于部落间错综复杂的问题还不善于很好地处理，就简单地把它解决了。
      观众都感到剧本冗长。这是由于作者不愿意舍弃一些次要的或者不必要的情节，同时导演也没能大胆地给予适当的按排，以致减去了歌剧的特点——洗炼和集中。同时，在表达人物思想感情方面，作者用了过多的叙述描写，如春风、蝴蝶、黄莺、布谷鸟、高山、流水……但直接地深刻地把人物内心的真实感情用诗的语言传达给观众，使人能够随着剧中人一道呼吸，这方面所下的工夫还不够。
    在主要的人物方面，虽然突出地刻划了阿布扎和侬错加，但在这些人物身上，也还有和他们的真实的英雄性格相矛盾的地方，如侬错加为了爱情，就忍心地抛弃了从三岁起把她抚养大的、相依为命的、被阿布扎误伤后仍在流血的父亲；这未免太不近人情。阿布扎是新生力量的代表，但他对部落间仇杀的态度却是模糊的。如第二幕当巴扎部落头人发出抢马的命令后，阿布扎对着不愿意他去参加仇杀的父亲便这样唱道：“为我祈祷吧，为我祝福吧，我要活着回来，带着我的爱人，骑着夺回的马，唱着胜利的歌儿来见你老人家。”这完全是征服者的姿态；部落仇杀和爱情的矛盾，在他身上似乎不存在。因此就降低了这个英雄人物的思想性。而被称为老英雄的万老公布，虽然十年前他让自己的儿子去当红军，女儿的爱情和部落仇杀也使他矛盾，但看不到他对仇杀的更明确的态度，他的英雄行为是什么？观众也看不到。因此这位老英雄没有在人们的脑子里留下什么印象。
    “草原之歌”的音乐，使人感到不足的，就是在塑造人物音乐形象上，缺乏鲜明的性格。因为歌剧音乐不仅要表现人物在规定情景中，由于对待不同的人和事的态度所引起的内心活动及思想感情的变化，更重要的是在塑造人物音乐形象时要具有鲜明的性格。否则它就达不到深刻地表现生活实质的要求。“草原之歌”的作曲者也曾有意识地对人物性格加以刻划，如作为全剧中心人物的阿布扎和侬错加，在这两个人物的音乐形象中，就出现了不少健康、明朗、优美的曲调，但这仅只表现了这两个人物勇敢、青春的一面，而更深刻地来描写他们的心理状态，更细致地来表现他们的思想情感就不够了。因此优美动听的曲调虽然出现了不少，能让人留下深刻印象的——能够表达出典型环境中典型人物的内在思想活动的音乐是不多的。这是由于作曲者对生活的本质挖掘得还不够深，缺乏对人物性格的更深刻的理解、掌握和表现能力。
    在管弦乐方面，虽然比过去的新歌剧丰富了些，但还是表现得不够细腻和深刻，和声的运用还不能随着情节的发展给以更多的变化；因此色彩就不够丰富，显得有些单调。尤其四幕二场解放军进入草原时，这是全剧发展的转折点，也显示出草原上人们的生活从此有了大的变革。所以当象征着兄弟民族幸福生活的红旗出现在高山坡上的时候，就要求出现和以前完全不同的、能够展示新的生活面貌的音乐把心情已激动起的观众引入更高涨的情绪中去，但这时的音乐却显得无力，没有达到应有的效果，以致影响到后几场戏的情绪，不能挑起更热烈的高潮。
    在这次演出中，很多观众感到听不清唱词。这一方面是由于作曲者谱曲时，没有将有些字的轻重音的配置很好地符合中国语言的规律——语气、语调。同时对字的四声的注意也不够；这样，听起来就同原来的意思有出入，使人不易理解了。还有一个重要的原因，是有些演员不了解在歌剧中的演唱同一般的演唱有所不同；演员同观众有着相当的距离，尤其唱中国的拼音单字时，如果子音不咬得清楚一些，刹一下就过去了，观众听到的就只是长而响的母音；同时，许多演员常是用固定的口型去唱母音，这就很不容易听出演唱者究竟在唱什么。我们很多戏曲音乐之所以被群众喜爱，首先就是它们的唱能够字字让人听得清楚。我认为这是值得新歌剧演员学习和研究的。
    “草原之歌”的剧作者和作曲者都是青年作家，他们对创作这样大型歌剧也不是有很丰富的经验的，能有现在这样的成绩，是不容易的。我们欢迎它的演出。希望作者们从这次创作中吸取经验，为创作更成功的作品而努力。
