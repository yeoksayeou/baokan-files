The newly established Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications and the Beijing Foreign Affairs College held their opening ceremonies on the 10th. Another institution of higher education newly built in Beijing this year, the Beijing Normal College, will open on October 4th. With this, Beijing has reached twenty-seven institutions of higher education.

In addition to the newly built schools, the original institutions of higher learning in Beijing have also increased their specialized programs on the existing basis in the new academic year. The Department of Geology and Geography of Peking University has added two majors, Geology and Economic Geography, in order to cultivate comprehensive research talents related to geology for my country's Second Five-Year Plan. Tsinghua University has added three new majors. These two universities have now developed to more than 6,000 people, exceeding the number of students after the departmental adjustment in 1952 by more than 50%. In addition, most engineering colleges have also changed to a new five-year academic system and adopted new teaching plans in order to improve the quality of teaching.

This year, a total of more than 19,000 new students have enrolled in universities and colleges throughout the city, and the total number of university students in the city is expected to reach 57,000, an increase of three times compared with the early days of liberation in 1949.

    北京已有二十七所高等学校
    新建的北京邮电学院、北京外交学院十日举行开学典礼。今年在北京新建的另一所高等学校——北京师范学院将在十月四日开学。到此，北京高等学校已达到二十七所。
    除了新建的学校外，北京原有的高等院校在新学年中也都在原有的基础上增加了专业设置。北京大学地质地理系新增了地质学和经济地理两专业，以便为我国第二个五年计划培养有关地质方面的综合研究人材。清华大学新增了三个专业。这两个大学现在已发展到六千多人，超过了在一九五二年院系调整后的学生人数百分之五十以上。另外大部工科院为了提高教学质量还改为五年的新学制，和采用了新的教学计划。
    今年全市高等学校共有一万九千多名新生入学，全市大学生预计将达到五万七千人。比一九四九年解放初期增加了三倍。　（新华社）
