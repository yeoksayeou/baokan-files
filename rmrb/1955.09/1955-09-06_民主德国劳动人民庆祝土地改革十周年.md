Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 5th: In the past few days, working people in various parts of the German Democratic Republic have been holding gatherings to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first truly democratic land reform in German history.

　　A national celebration meeting was held in Halle on September 2nd. Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a speech at the meeting. After describing the achievements made in the past ten years, he spoke about the reunification of Germany. He emphasized that a reunified Germany must be a democratic and peaceful country, in which the rule of the Junker landlords must be completely eliminated throughout Germany, so that the working people can move towards happiness in peace.

　　Paul Verner, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, described in his speech the enormous changes brought about by the land reform in the social and economic structure and compared the lives of farmers in East and West Germany. He said that the savings of farmers in the German Democratic Republic are increasing year by year, while the debts of farmers in West Germany are constantly increasing. Verner finally pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is creating conditions to fully mechanize all strenuous field work by 1960.

　　On September 3rd, a get-together with farmers from West Germany was also held in Halle. During the get-together, Ulbricht answered many questions raised by the West German farmers.

　　Celebration meetings were also held in Dresden, Merseburg and other places.
