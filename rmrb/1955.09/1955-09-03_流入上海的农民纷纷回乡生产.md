    Farmers who blindly flowed into Shanghai have been returning to their hometowns to participate in production. In August, over 268,000 people returned. Currently, one to two thousand people apply to the government to return to their hometowns every day. These farmers generally have land, houses, or other production and living conditions in their places of origin. After flowing into Shanghai, they find life difficult because they lack fixed employment or any employment at all.
    Since July, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee and the People's Committees of various districts have established special agencies to assist farmers flowing into Shanghai to return to their hometowns. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces have sent cadres to introduce the situation in rural areas to the farmers flowing into Shanghai from their respective areas. All departments in Shanghai have made every effort to help returning farmers. Railway and shipping departments have increased vehicles and liners, and relevant departments have established transit stations in eight transportation hubs such as Zhenjiang, Ningbo, and Bengbu to help returning farmers solve problems such as food, accommodation, and transportation along the way. Farmers with difficulties in paying part of their travel expenses have also received government subsidies.
    Many farmers sent letters to their relatives and friends in Shanghai or to government departments after returning home, saying that they received the care and settlement from the local government when they returned to their hometowns. More than 180 farmers from Shenhuang District, Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, who returned from Shanghai, have mostly joined agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    流入上海的农民纷纷回乡生产
    从农村中盲目流入上海的农民，在八月份有二十六万八千多人回乡参加生产。目前每天都有一、二千人向政府申请回乡。这些农民在原籍一般都有土地、房屋或其他生产、生活条件，他们流入上海后，因为没有固定职业或者没有职业，生活反而困难。
    七月份以来，上海市人民委员会和各区人民委员会，为协助流入上海的农民回乡，成立了专门机构。江苏、浙江、安徽等省，都派了干部来向当地流入上海的农民介绍农村情况。上海市各部门对回乡农民尽力予以帮助。铁路、航运部门增加了车辆、班轮，有关部门在镇江、宁波、蚌埠等八个交通枢纽设立了转运站，帮助回乡农民解决途中的食宿、交通等问题。部分路费有困难的农民还得到政府的补助。
    许多农民回乡后给在上海的亲友或政府部门来信说，他们回到家乡时得到了当地政府的关怀和安置。江苏省盐城县沈黄区一百八十多个农民从上海回去后，大部分参加了农业生产合作社。
