To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan

In 1937, Japanese imperialism launched a large-scale war of aggression against China. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, both military and civilians, united and fought for eight years. Finally, with the assistance of the great ally, the Soviet army, they achieved the final victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. On September 2, 1945, the Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender, and September 3 became the day of victory for the Chinese people's war against Japan.

The war of aggression launched by Japanese imperialism brought profound disasters to the Chinese people and endless suffering to the Japanese people. After Japan's surrender, Japan became a colony day by day under the rule of the American occupiers. The American occupiers attempted to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a military base for launching aggressive wars in the Far East, which further aggravated the disasters of the Japanese people. Now, the Japanese people's struggle for national independence and for defending lasting peace in the world and the Far East is vigorously unfolding.

The Chinese people suffered long-term aggression from Japanese militarism. The eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan caused serious losses to the lives and property of the Chinese people. After the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, quickly healed the wounds of war and began the great socialist construction. The Chinese people are actively striving for lasting peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with the plight of the Japanese people under American military occupation and support the Japanese people's just struggle for independence, peace, freedom, and democracy. In recent years, the Chinese people have extended a hand of friendship to the Japanese people, expressing their willingness to live in friendship with the Japanese people through various practical actions, and to work for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and the development of economic and cultural relations between the two countries.

Opposing war and defending peace are the common aspirations of the Chinese and Japanese people. The people of the two countries will never allow the revival of Japanese militarism, and will never allow the tragedy of war to be repeated. (Xinhua News Agency)

The Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people in a just war against Japanese aggressors. The picture shows Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu studying combat plans during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army (the predecessor of the Chinese People's Liberation Army) annihilated more than 3,000 soldiers of the elite Itagaki Division of the Japanese army at Pingxingguan. This victory boosted the confidence of the people across the country in winning the War of Resistance. The picture shows the Eighth Route Army cavalry breaking through Pingxingguan, which was occupied by the enemy, and advancing rapidly.

The New Fourth Army (the predecessor of the Chinese People's Liberation Army) opened up large anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines in the north and south of the Yangtze River, and led the people to launch guerrilla warfare. The picture shows soldiers of the New Fourth Army firing at the enemy in the Battle of Majiayuan.

The Yanling Detachment in Baiyangdian, central Hebei Province, is a heroic anti-Japanese guerrilla force on the water. The picture shows the Yanling Detachment boarding boats from Wen'anwa to the Bohai Sea area during the summer offensive in 1944.

The cooperation between the army and the people to launch a struggle to cut off transportation lines greatly weakened the enemy's combat power.

In 1945, after the Soviet Red Army defeated German fascists, it dispatched troops to Northeast China on August 9, completely annihilating the most elite Japanese force—the Kwantung Army—and forced Japanese fascists to surrender unconditionally, helping the Chinese people achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan at an early date. The picture shows the citizens of Dalian warmly welcoming the Soviet army into the city.

    纪念抗日战争胜利十周年
    一九三七年，日本帝国主义向中国发动了大规模的侵略战争，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，军民一致，抗战八年，终于在伟大盟邦苏联军队的援助下，取得了抗日战争的最后胜利。一九四五年九月二日，日本政府在投降条约上签字，九月三日这一天，就成为中国人民对日战争胜利日。
    日本帝国主义发动的侵略战争，带给中国人民深重的灾难，同时也给日本人民带来了无穷的痛苦。日本投降后，日本在美国占领者的统治下，一天天殖民地化，美国占领者企图复活日本军国主义，变日本为它在远东发动侵略战争的军事基地，这就更加重了日本人民的灾难。现在，日本人民为争取民族独立，为保卫世界和远东的持久和平而进行的斗争正蓬勃展开。
    中国人民长期遭受日本军国主义的侵略，八年的抗日战争，使中国人民的生命财产遭受严重的损失。在中国人民解放战争获得胜利后，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，迅速医治了战争创伤，并开始了伟大的社会主义建设。中国人民积极争取亚洲和世界的持久和平。中国人民深切同情日本人民在美国军事占领下的悲惨境遇，支持日本人民为争取独立、和平、自由、民主而进行的正义斗争。几年来，中国人民向日本人民伸出友谊的手，以各种实际行动表示愿和日本人民友好相处，为促进中日关系正常化，为发展两国间的经济和文化关系而努力。
    反对战争，保卫和平是中日两国人民的共同愿望，两国人民决不允许日本军国主义复活，决不允许战争的惨剧重演。　（新华社稿）
