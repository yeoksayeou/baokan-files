Respected Commander-in-Chief General Ne Win, Generals and Officers, Ambassador U Myint Thein, Friends and Comrades:

We are very pleased that the Burmese Military Friendship Delegation, headed by Commander-in-Chief Ne Win, has come to our country for a visit at the invitation of our government. On behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I would like to extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guests, Commander-in-Chief Ne Win and all the Generals and Officers; and extend our sincere respect to you, and through you to the Government and people of the Union of Burma.

China and Burma have a long and profound traditional friendship in history. In modern times, the anti-colonialist struggles of our two peoples for national independence and freedom have deepened the mutual sympathy and concern between our two peoples, thereby further deepening the friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this friendship between our two countries has been further developed. In recent years, our two countries have witnessed increasing cultural and economic exchanges, and have sent cultural and trade delegations to each other, strengthening friendly cooperation in culture and economy. It should be particularly mentioned that last year the Prime Ministers of China and Burma paid mutual visits and issued joint statements and communiqués, which laid the foundation for the peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between our two countries. This time, the Union of Burma has again been invited to send a military friendship delegation headed by Commander-in-Chief Ne Win to visit our country. We believe that this friendly visit will promote mutual understanding between our two armed forces, thereby helping our two governments and peoples to further develop the friendly relations between our two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Commander-in-Chief and Generals and Officers, you will soon be visiting our capital and other places in our country. You will see that our people love peace, and that our armed forces are an army that defends the fruits of our people's revolutionary victory and the achievements of socialist construction. The Chinese people resolutely oppose imperialist aggression, but will never invade others. Our army is an army that defends peace.

Commander-in-Chief and Generals and Officers, during your visit, you will personally witness the friendship of our people and their army towards the people and army of Burma. I firmly believe that your visit will enhance mutual understanding between us, thereby benefiting the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

I propose a toast to the friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Burma, to peace in Asia and the world;

To the health of Mr. U Ba Swe, Minister of Defense of the Union of Burma, and to the health of all the delegates of the delegation headed by Commander-in-Chief Ne Win!

    彭德怀元帅的讲话尊敬的总司令奈温将军、各位将军和军官，吴拉茂大使先生，各位朋友们、同志们：
    以奈温总司令为首的缅甸军事友好代表团应我国政府的邀请，前来我国访问，我们感到十分高兴。我谨代表中华人民共和国政府和人民、以及中国人民解放军，向我们的贵宾、奈温总司令和诸位将军和军官，表示热烈的欢迎；向你们、并通过你们向缅甸联邦政府和人民致以衷心的敬意。
    中缅两国在历史上就有着悠久而深厚的传统友谊。近代以来，我们两国人民为了争取民族的独立和自由而进行的反殖民主义的斗争，加深了我们两国人民的互相同情和关怀，因而更加深了两国人民的友谊和相互了解。中华人民共和国成立以后，我们中缅两国的这种友谊，有了进一步的发展。几年来，我们两国文化与经济交流日益增多，并互相派遣了文化、贸易代表团，加强了两国文化与经济上的友好合作。特别应该提到的是，去年中缅两国总理进行了互相访问，并发表了联合声明和会谈公报，为我们两国和平共处和友好合作奠定了基础。这次，缅甸联邦又应邀派遣了以奈温总司令为首的军事友好代表团来我国访问，我们相信，这种友谊的访问，必将促进我们两国军队的相互了解，从而有助于我们两国政府和人民在和平共处的五项原则基础上，进一步发展我们两国之间的友好关系。
    总司令和各位将军、军官们，你们即将在我国首都和各地参观，你们将会看到我国人民是热爱和平的，我国的武装力量是保卫我国人民革命胜利的果实和社会主义建设成果的军队。中国人民坚决反对帝国主义的侵略，但也决不会去侵略别人。我们的军队是保卫和平的军队。
    总司令和各位将军、军官们，你们在参观中将亲自看到我国人民及其军队对缅甸人民及其军队的友情，我深信，你们的参观访问必将增进我们之间的互相了解，从而有利于亚洲和世界的和平事业。
    我提议为中缅两国人民和军队间的友好、为亚洲及世界和平；
    为缅甸联邦国防部长吴巴瑞先生的健康，为以奈温总司令为首的代表团全体代表的健康，干杯！
