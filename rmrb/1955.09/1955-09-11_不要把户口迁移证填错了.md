    Don't Fill Out Household Registration Transfer Certificates Incorrectly
    Comrade Editor:
    I am a clerk at the Dongguan Town People's Government in Shangyu County. In handling household registration transfer work, I have found that some comrades doing household registration work are irresponsible and often write the names, ages, and addresses of people transferring their household registration incorrectly, which causes great difficulties for household registration management work. For example, the Zifang Police Station of the Second Sub-bureau of Xuzhou City, in the transfer certificate issued to Dong Yucheng (from Fengrun County, Hebei), wrote his name as "Dong Yuchen." Also, Wang Boliang, who moved from Xiaoshan County with his family of three, had errors in the ages filled in on their transfer certificates; Wang Boliang is thirty-five years old this year (born in 1920), but the transfer certificate states he was born in 1926. Wang Chunyou, who moved from the same county, had his name written as Wang Zaiyou on the transfer certificate; he is sixty-eight years old this year (should be born in 1887), but it is written as born in 1883. We investigated the twenty-eight households and over one hundred and twenty people living in the Xincun neighborhood of the Dongguan Town Railway Station and found a total of ninety-five errors in names, ages, and dates of birth on the transfer certificates.
    I believe that managing household registration is an important part of public security work. At a time when class struggle is becoming increasingly acute and complex, we should do a good job in household registration management to prevent hidden enemies from using legal identities to lie dormant and carry out sabotage.

### 不要把户口迁移证填错了

    不要把户口迁移证填错了编辑同志：
    我是上虞县东关镇人民政府的文书。我在办理户口迁移工作时，发现有些做户籍工作的同志对待工作不负责，常常把户口迁移人的姓名、年龄、住址写错，给户口管理工作造成很大困难。像徐州市第二分局子房派出所在发给董玉晨的（河北丰润县人）迁移证上，把他的名字写成了“董玉臣”。又像萧山县迁来的王伯良，全家三口，迁移证上填的年龄都有错误；王伯良今年已经三十五岁（一九二○年生），迁移证上写的却是一九二六年生。这个县迁来的王春有，迁移证上姓名写成了王在有；他今年六十八岁（应为一八八七年生），却写成一八八三年生。我们调查了东关镇火车站新村所住的二十八户人家、一百二十余人，迁移证上发生姓名、年龄、出生年月的错误共有九十五处。
    我认为，管理户口是治安工作的一个重要环节，在目前阶级斗争日渐尖锐复杂的情况下，更应该做好户口管理工作，以堵塞暗藏的敌人用合法身份潜伏进行破坏的漏洞。
