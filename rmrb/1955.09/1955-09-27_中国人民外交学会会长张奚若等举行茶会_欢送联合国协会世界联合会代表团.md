Xinhua News Agency, September 26th. President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Xiruo, and other responsible members of the Institute held a tea party on the afternoon of the 26th to bid farewell to the World Federation of United Nations Associations delegation, which came to China for a visit at the invitation of the Institute.

    Zhang Xiruo delivered a speech at the meeting, saying: "The Chinese government and people have consistently upheld the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and we support the efforts of the World Federation of United Nations Associations to realize the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and promote friendly cooperation among countries.

    China is one of the founding countries of the United Nations. After its establishment, the People's Republic of China has resolutely demanded that the United Nations expel the Chiang Kai-shek clique, a handful of fugitives who fled to Taiwan and are sheltered by foreign forces, and restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. However, under the manipulation of certain forces hostile to the Chinese people, the United Nations has repeatedly rejected this just demand. Recently, the international situation has eased, and people of all countries have demanded that the United Nations General Assembly correct this error, but the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly has continued to illegally deprive the People's Republic of China of its status and rights in the United Nations. This violates the United Nations Charter, is not in line with the wishes of the people of the world, and is not conducive to maintaining international peace and security.

    In contrast to the United Nations, the World Federation of United Nations Associations has refused the participation of the illegal organization in Taiwan since 1950 and advocated restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Recently, the plenary representatives of the tenth session held in Bangkok unanimously passed a resolution, reaffirming this proposition. This reflects the will of peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese people express their gratitude for this righteous act and friendly gesture.

    The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs welcomes the delegation of the World Federation of United Nations Associations to visit China and hopes to continue to develop its ties with the World Federation of United Nations Associations and with friendly associations of various countries through this visit."

    Charles Judd, head of the delegation of the World Federation of United Nations Associations, expressed his gratitude for the invitation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and said that he would continue to work to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and promote friendly cooperation among countries.

    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若等举行茶会
    欢送联合国协会世界联合会代表团
    新华社二十六日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若和学会其他负责人在二十六日下午举行茶会，欢送应学会邀请前来中国访问的联合国协会世界联合会代表团。
    张奚若在会上致词，他说：“中国政府和人民是一贯维护联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的，我们支持联合国协会世界联合会为实现联合国宪章的宗旨和原则和促进各国友好合作的努力。
    中国是联合国创始国之一。中华人民共和国在它成立之后就坚决要求联合国把一小撮逃亡到台湾的、受外来势力庇护的蒋介石集团的代表驱逐出去，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位，但是联合国在某些敌视中国人民的势力的操纵之下，一再拒绝了这一正义的要求。最近国际局势有了缓和，各国人民都要求联合国大会纠正这一错误，但是联合国大会第十届会议竟又继续非法剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国的地位和权利。这是违反联合国宪章，不符合世界人民的愿望和不利于维护国际和平和安全的。
    和联合国相反，联合国协会世界联合会自一九五○年即拒绝了台湾非法组织的参加，并主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。最近在曼谷举行的第十届会议全体代表又一致通过决议，再次肯定这一主张。这反映了全世界爱好和平人民的意志。中国人民对这种正义行为和友好表现表示感谢。
    中国人民外交学会欢迎联合国协会世界联合会代表团访问中国，并希望通过这次访问继续发展它同联合国协会世界联合会以及同对中国友好的各国协会之间的联系”。
    联合国协会世界联合会代表团团长查尔斯·贾德对中国人民外交学会的邀请表示感谢，并表示将继续为恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利和促进各国友好合作而努力。
