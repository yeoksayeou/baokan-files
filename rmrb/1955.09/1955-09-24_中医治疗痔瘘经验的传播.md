Spreading Experience in Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment of Hemorrhoids and Fistulas
　　Bai Sheng

　　The Chongqing Hemorrhoids and Fistula Medical Team, which is spreading experience in traditional Chinese medicine treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas in Beijing, has achieved excellent treatment results using the escharotic therapy for hemorrhoids and the seton therapy for fistulas. Because this treatment method has significant advantages over Western surgical excision for hemorrhoids and fistulas, people attach great importance to its widespread application and dissemination. Recently, this medical team has received more than 700 letters from all over the country and from countries such as the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Burma, and Belgium, all praising the excellent effects of this therapy and requesting detailed introductions to its experience.

　　Hemorrhoids and fistulas are one of the most common chronic diseases in various countries around the world. In China, there has long been the saying "nine out of ten people have hemorrhoids," which shows that this disease is very common. Hemorrhoids and fistulas refer to hemorrhoidal masses (sores) and fistula tracts, which are both diseases inside and outside the anus. The anal canal is a section of about four centimeters long in the anal region. The anal canal is surrounded by the internal and external sphincter muscles and the levator ani muscle. There is a comb-like line where the anal canal connects to the rectum, and many venous vessels are gathered above and below the comb-like line. When blood circulation is obstructed and stagnates here, venous congestion forms, and the blood vessels become tortuous or dilated, thus swelling up and becoming hemorrhoids. Those that grow above the comb-like line are called internal hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids are not visible at first. They grow inside the anus and only bleed slightly during bowel movements; when they become severe, they prolapse out of the anus during bowel movements and must be manually pushed back into the anus; or because blood flow is blocked, the hemorrhoidal mass becomes larger and larger, and even manual pressure cannot return it to the anus, causing the patient great pain. Hemorrhoidal masses that grow below the comb-like line are called external hemorrhoids, which are exposed outside the anus and can be seen from the beginning. People who sit still for long periods, have poor bowel habits, malnutrition, weak constitution, women who have given birth too many times, or have a genetic predisposition are all prone to hemorrhoids. Fistula tracts are also the most common chronic surgical diseases in the anal region. Most often, they are initially caused by an abscess due to the invasion of viruses around the anus. After the abscess ruptures, the wound does not heal for a long time, forming a tubular wound, which is called a fistula tract. The most obvious symptoms of a fistula tract are pus leakage and fecal leakage.

　　Hemorrhoids and fistulas in various countries are mostly treated by surgical excision; in the past, Western medicine in China has also used this method. However, Western surgical excision of hemorrhoids and fistulas is subject to many restrictions, such as hemorrhoid patients with severe hypertension, heart disease, tuberculosis, anemia, and the elderly and infirm are not suitable for surgical excision and can only use long-term palliative therapy. Even if surgery is performed, it often recurs, especially the excision surgery for fistula tracts, which can even cause adverse sequelae such as not being able to pass stool or being unable to control bowel movements.

　　Using traditional Chinese medicine's escharotic therapy and seton therapy to treat hemorrhoids and fistulas does not have these drawbacks. Escharotic therapy uses a Chinese medicine with strong corrosive and astringent properties—"escharotic powder"—and applies it to the surface of the internal hemorrhoids, causing the hemorrhoidal mass to quickly necrotize, dry up, and fall off, eventually healing. This medicine is made of arsenic trioxide, alum, lapis medicamentorum, sulfur, and realgar. It is a light yellow powdery medicine. Using this medicinal therapy is not only simpler and less prone to bleeding than Western surgical therapy, reducing the patient's pain, but it also prevents recurrence after healing. At the same time, this escharotic therapy can be used to treat hemorrhoid patients who also have anemia or high blood pressure, as well as the elderly and infirm. As for the seton therapy of traditional Chinese medicine for anorectal fistula tracts, it mainly uses a silk thread with slight corrosive properties, threaded through the fistula tract, gradually cutting open the fistula tract and draining the pus; after the pus is completely removed, new muscle slowly grows. Using this seton therapy, there will be no problems with not being able to pass stool or not being able to control bowel movements after healing.

　　Treating hemorrhoids and fistula patients with escharotic therapy and seton therapy is a valuable legacy of ancient Chinese medicine. Our ancestors accumulated extremely rich experience in treating hemorrhoids and fistula diseases. The causes, symptoms, and treatment of hemorrhoid and fistula diseases have long been recorded in detail in ancient Chinese medical books. For example, the earliest medical book "Huangdi Neijing Suwen" says: "Due to overeating, muscles and veins are transversely loosened, and intestinal prolapse causes hemorrhoids," which explains the cause of hemorrhoids. It was also discovered in the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing that Sophora japonica fruit and flower can treat "five kinds of hemorrhoids." By the Sui Dynasty, Chao Yuanfang had a detailed explanation of the five kinds of hemorrhoids. In the Song Dynasty, Dou Hanqing divided the five kinds of hemorrhoids into twenty-five types according to their shape. By the Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, there was further development. In terms of treatment methods, according to existing literature records, there are no less than one hundred kinds, summarized into about nine categories: internal treatment, acupuncture treatment, guidance therapy, moxibustion therapy, cauterization therapy, fumigation and washing therapy, external treatment, escharotic therapy, and seton therapy. However, before the Tang Dynasty, the main treatment was internal treatment, which was to use medicine to treat, such as eating Sophora japonica fruit and flower. After the Song Dynasty, external treatment began to be applied, such as fumigation and washing therapy, and escharotic therapy. By the Ming Dynasty, escharotic therapy and seton therapy were widely used and were recorded in detail. In Lou Ying's "Medical Outline" in the Ming Dynasty, there are detailed records of the ancients using escharotic therapy to treat internal hemorrhoids, and in Xu Chunfu's "General Records of Ancient and Modern Medicine" in the Ming Dynasty, there are detailed records of the ancients using seton therapy to treat fistula tracts. The most common and most important treatments that have been passed down to this day are escharotic therapy and seton therapy. From the existing literature, it appears that the escharotic therapy we use today was discovered in the Song Dynasty, and the seton therapy was discovered in the Ming Dynasty.

　　This effective method of treating hemorrhoids and fistulas only had the possibility of widespread dissemination after liberation. In October 1952, under the guidance of the Party and the government's policy of uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine and promoting the motherland's medicine, the Surgical Society of the Chongqing Branch of the Chinese Medical Association and the Chongqing Health Workers Association jointly held a symposium to specifically discuss the methods of traditional Chinese and Western medicine for treating hemorrhoids and fistulas. At this time, the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners put forward the effective treatment methods of using escharotic powder to treat hemorrhoids and using seton therapy to treat fistula tracts, which they had never passed on to outsiders in the past. After research by the former Southwest Health Department and the Chongqing Health Workers Association, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners Zhou Jimin, Jiang Houfu, and Zhang Ronghui were sent to the Chongqing Seventh People's Hospital to focus on trying out traditional Chinese medicine methods to treat internal hemorrhoids and fistula tracts. Soon after, the Seventh People's Hospital officially established a hemorrhoids and fistula department, and sent surgeons Li Kaitai and Chen Zhihan to cooperate with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in treating hemorrhoids and fistulas. At that time, these two Western medicine doctors were very dissatisfied, believing that there were many things they needed to learn, and even the time to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was not enough, so how could they have time to learn "backward" traditional Chinese medicine, which was simply "driving backwards." They worried that if they cooperated with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in this way for a long time, even their Western medicine knowledge and skills would be wasted. Therefore, they adopted a passive attitude, often made things difficult for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and sometimes even did not approve patients to see traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. However, their erroneous view of discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine slowly changed in the face of facts. Once, a patient came, a sixty-year-old Soviet friend named Hrisosoff who had suffered from internal hemorrhoids for thirty-five years. Because he had undergone multiple surgical treatments in Western medicine that had not been cured, but had instead caused severe anemia, he resolutely demanded that the Chongqing Seventh People's Hospital use traditional Chinese medicine methods to treat him when he learned about the traditional Chinese medicine treatment method for hemorrhoids. When he arrived at the Seventh People's Hospital, his hemoglobin was only 40%, and his anemia was very serious. The hemorrhoidal mass was already the size of a duck egg. At that time, Western medicine believed that the patient's condition was relatively serious, and in addition to adopting long-term palliative treatment, the only option was to perform surgical treatment under blood transfusion, but it was difficult to guarantee that it would not recur. At that time, the patient refused to undergo surgery again and resolutely requested treatment with traditional Chinese medicine methods. The traditional Chinese medicine practitioners used escharotic therapy for treatment, applying escharotic powder nine times. In just fifteen days, the hemorrhoidal mass that had tormented the patient for a long time completely fell off. Soon, the patient was discharged from the hospital happily. The patient later wrote a letter to the hospital saying: "Without surgery, the hemorrhoids disappeared, and the intestines did not prolapse. Although my body is still weak, I am now able to work very easily and am no longer afraid of rectal prolapse. I am very happy and very satisfied that you have this therapy." Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners had continuously cured many patients like Hrisosoff. In the face of a series of facts, Western medicine doctors' thoughts of despising traditional Chinese medicine began to change, and they admitted that traditional Chinese medicine had rich experience, and began to conduct case studies and discussions with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and learn the traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods for hemorrhoids and fistulas from traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. From then on, this hemorrhoids and fistula medical team truly embarked on the road of cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

　　In early 1954, Huang Jichuan, a famous traditional Chinese medicine hemorrhoids and fistula expert in Chengdu, Sichuan, who was over ninety years old, heard that a traditional Chinese medicine hemorrhoids and fistula department had been established in a Chongqing hospital, and that his students were participating in the treatment, and that Western medicine doctors were also learning, so he came to the Chongqing Seventh People's Hospital to observe and guide. This old traditional Chinese medicine practitioner had more than 60 years of rich clinical experience in treating hemorrhoids and fistula diseases, but in the old society, he was influenced by feudal conservative ideas, and his important clinical experience and detailed preparation methods for effective hemorrhoids and fistula medicines had never been publicly taught to others. This time, he was very touched to see the good situation of cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine in treating hemorrhoids and fistulas at the Chongqing Seventh People's Hospital, and to be respected by Western medicine doctors. He personally burned escharotic powder to apply medicine to patients and guided young traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in learning. Later, he returned to Chengdu, and in October 1954, he finally made public his secret recipe for treating hemorrhoids and fistulas and his clinical experience that had never been passed on to outsiders for more than 60 years. The method of treating hemorrhoids and fistulas adopted by the traditional Chinese and Western medicine cooperation hemorrhoids and fistula team at the Chongqing Seventh People's Hospital absorbed his rich clinical treatment experience.

　　In more than a year of clinical practice in Chongqing, this hemorrhoids and fistula team cured a total of 290 hemorrhoid patients and 333 fistula patients. Their treatment achievements attracted the attention of all parties. In order to better disseminate the experience of traditional Chinese medicine treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas, with the attention of the Ministry of Health, two traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and two Western medicine doctors from the Chongqing hemorrhoids and fistula medical team were sent to Beijing in September 1954 to impart their experience. In October 1954, they began medical work at the Sixth Hospital directly under the Central Government in Beijing. From October 1954 to September this year, they have cured more than 900 hemorrhoid and fistula patients in Beijing using escharotic therapy and seton therapy. It can be seen from here the significant advantages and curative effects of the traditional Chinese medicine treatment method for hemorrhoids and fistulas. This curative effect has been recognized by the Western medicine doctors who participated in the study. Wu Jingbo, a surgeon at the Sixth Hospital directly under the Central Government, said: After this clinical study, I really feel that the traditional Chinese medicine hemorrhoids and fistula therapy has many advantages. It is not only effective and can be cured, but also the treatment time is short, the patient suffers less, and the operation and equipment are simple and easy to promote. In particular, it is not as prone to causing serious sequelae such as anal stenosis and anal incontinence as Western surgical therapy. At present, many surgeons in Beijing have learned this traditional Chinese medicine treatment method for hemorrhoids and fistulas, and have begun clinical treatment in their respective hospitals, achieving very good results.

　　Due to the close cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, the traditional Chinese medicine treatment method for hemorrhoids and fistulas has gained new development. Western medicine doctors have helped traditional Chinese medicine practitioners improve their treatment methods. For example, the registration of medical records, the diagnosis of pathology, the application of surgical instruments, disinfection, and the observation of the condition have all applied new medical methods. Especially in the improvement of the traditional Chinese medicine escharotic powder, significant achievements have been made in solving the problem of poisoning. Arsenic trioxide in traditional Chinese medicine escharotic powder is a highly toxic medicine that is prone to causing pain and burns when applied to the skin. Sometimes, if the amount used is slightly inappropriate, poisoning may occur. After research and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, when using escharotic powder, they give patients intravenous injections of Novocain (anesthetic) on the one hand to reduce the patient's pain. At the same time, in order to prevent poisoning, achieve safety and simplicity, and be easy to master, they have improved the ingredients and production methods of escharotic powder after repeated research. Now they have initially tried escharotic powder made of alum, copper sulfate, and seeds of Brucea javanica. After clinical trials, this escharotic powder has a good curative effect and can completely avoid the risk of poisoning. It is currently under further research. After the cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, significant progress has also been made in the treatment of fistula tracts. Many more complicated fistula tracts have adopted the method of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment, that is, performing surgery on the one hand and seton therapy on the other hand, with better curative effects.

　　The traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods and experience for hemorrhoids and fistulas are very worthy of attention from the Chinese medical community. It is an effective method for treating hemorrhoid and fistula diseases in various countries around the world. This is a valuable medical legacy left by our ancestors, and we should study, research, organize, and improve it well to further develop it. The Chongqing hemorrhoids and fistula medical team has made achievements in this regard. They have set a good example in spreading the experience of traditional Chinese medicine treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas, Western medicine doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Chinese and Western medicine uniting and cooperating, and organizing and promoting the medical legacy of the motherland. Their experience tells us that as long as traditional Chinese and Western medicine can unite and cooperate closely, and Western medicine can learn from traditional Chinese medicine with an open mind, then the motherland's rich medical legacy will be rapidly developed.

    中医治疗痔瘘经验的传播
    柏生
    在北京传播中医治疗痔瘘经验的重庆痔瘘医疗小组，用枯痔疗法治疗痔疮、用挂线疗法治疗瘘管，取得了优异的治疗成绩。由于这种治疗方法比西医用手术疗法割治痔瘘有显著的优点，人们对它的广泛应用和传播非常重视。最近，这个医疗小组收到了来自全国各地和来自苏联、蒙古、缅甸、比利时等国的七百多封信，信上一致赞扬这种疗法的优异效果，要求详细介绍它的经验。
    痔瘘是世界各国最常见的一种慢性疾病，我国早就流传着“十人九痔”的话，可见这种病症是很普遍的。所谓痔瘘，就是痔核（疮）和瘘管，都是肛门内外的病症。肛门地方有一段长约四公分的肛管。肛管周围由内外括约肌和提肛肌围绕着。在肛管和直肠相连的地方有条梳状腺，许多静脉管就聚集在梳状腺的上下。当血液循环发生障碍停滞在这里时，就形成静脉郁血，血管迂曲或扩张，于是胀大起来，就成了痔疮。长在梳状腺上面的叫内痔。内痔开始看不见。它长在肛门里面，只是在大便时出点血；等到严重起来以后，它就在大便时脱出肛门之外，必须用手揉按才能收回到肛门里面去；或者因为血流阻止，痔核越胀越大，即使用手揉按也不能回到肛门里面去，使病人感到非常痛苦。痔核长在梳状腺下面的，叫外痔，它露在肛门外面，一开始就可以看得见。一个人经常坐着不动，大便习惯不好，营养不良，体质衰弱，妇女生育过多或遗传等，都很容易生痔疮。瘘管也是肛门部最多见的慢性外科疾病。最初多半是由于肛门周围受了病毒的侵袭而发生脓肿，破溃后，久不愈合就形成一个管状的伤口，这就叫作瘘管。瘘管最明显的症状是漏脓、漏粪。
    痔瘘这种病症，世界各国多是采用手术割治；过去我国西医也一直是采用这种方法。但西医割治痔瘘的手术要受很多限制，如患有严重的高血压、心脏病、肺结核、贫血症以及年老体弱的痔疮病人，都不宜动手术割治，只能采用长期的姑息疗法。即使动了手术，也往往复发，尤其是瘘管的割治手术，甚至造成不是大便不出来，就是肛门控制不住大便的不良后遗症。
    采用中医的枯痔疗法和挂线疗法治疗痔瘘，就没有这些弊病。枯痔疗法是使用一种带有强烈腐蚀性、收敛性的中药——“枯痔散”，把它涂在内痔的表面，使痔核很快坏死，干枯和脱落，最后痊愈。这种药是用白砒、白矾、月石、硫黄和雄黄配制成的。它是一种淡黄色粉末状的药物。使用这种药物疗法比西医手术疗法不但方法简便，不易出血，能够减少病人痛苦，而且治好以后，就不会再犯。同时，对于兼患有贫血症或高血压以及年老体弱的痔疮病人，都可以用这种枯痔疗法医治。至于中医治疗肛直肠瘘管的挂线疗法，主要是使用一条丝质的带有轻微腐蚀性的药线，贯穿到瘘管中，把瘘管逐渐割开，并把脓水引出来；等脓水除尽，新肌肉便慢慢生长起来。用这种挂线疗法，愈后不会发生大便不出来或肛门控制不住大便的毛病。
    用枯痔法和挂线法治疗痔瘘病人是我国古代医学的宝贵遗产。我们祖先对治疗痔瘘这种病症，积累了极其丰富的经验。关于痔瘘病症发生的原因、症状和治疗，在中国古医书里早就有了详细的记载。如最早的医书“黄帝内经素问”上说：“因而饱食，筋脉横解，肠澼为痔”，就说明了痔疮发生的原因。又在神农本草经上发现槐实、槐花可疗“五痔”的说法。到了隋朝，巢元方对五痔又有了详细的解释。宋朝窦汉卿并将五痔按形态分为二十五种。及至金、元、明、清等代，更有了进一步的发挥。在治疗方法方面，据已有的文献记载不下一百多种，综合起来约有内治法、针治法、导引法、灸治法、熨治法、薰洗法、外治法、枯痔法、挂线法等九类。但在唐代以前，主要是内治法，就是用吃药来治疗，如吃槐实、槐花等。宋代以后才开始应用外治法，如薰洗法、枯痔法等。而到明代才普遍采用了枯痔法和挂线法，并有了详细的记载。在明代楼英的“医学纲目”上就有古人对用枯痔疗法治疗内痔的详细记载，明代徐春甫的“古今医统”上就有古人对用挂线法治疗瘘管的详细记载。而流传到今天的最普遍也最主要的就是枯痔疗法和挂线疗法。我们今天应用的枯痔疗法，从现有文献上看，是发现在宋朝，挂线疗法发现在明朝。
    这种治疗痔瘘的有效方法，只是在解放以后才有了广泛传播的可能。一九五二年十月，在党和政府的团结中西医和发扬祖国医学的政策指导下，中华医学会重庆分会外科学会和重庆市卫生工作者协会共同召开了一个座谈会，专门讨论了中西医治疗痔瘘的方法。这时，中医师们提出了过去他们从未外传的用枯痔散治疗痔疮，用挂线法治疗瘘管的有效治疗方法。后经原西南卫生部和重庆市卫生工作者协会研究，便派中医师周济民、蒋厚甫、张荣辉等到重庆市第七人民医院重点试用中医治疗内痔和瘘管的方法。不久以后，第七人民医院正式成立了痔瘘科，派外科医师李开泰和陈之寒和中医合作治疗痔瘘。当时这两位西医很不满意，认为自己要学的东西很多，连学习苏联先进经验的时间都不够，哪还有时间来学习“落后”的中医学，这简直是在“开倒车”。他们担心，如果天长日久地这样同中医合作下去，连西医的一套知识和技术也会荒废的。因此他们采取了消极态度，经常跟中医为难，甚至有时连病人也不批准给中医看。但是，他们歧视中医的错误观点，在事实面前慢慢地改变了。一次，来了一个患者，这是患有内痔已三十五年的六十多岁的苏联友人希里索夫。他因为经过西医多次手术疗法都未根治，反而造成严重贫血，所以当他知道中医治疗痔疮的方法以后，便坚决要求重庆市第七人民医院使用中医方法治疗。在他到第七人民医院的时候，血色素只有百分之四十，贫血十分严重，痔核已经有鸭蛋大。当时西医认为病人情况比较严重，除采取长期的姑息疗法外，就只有在输血的情形下，施行手术疗法，但很难保证不再复发。当时病人拒绝再动手术，坚决请求用中医方法治疗。中医便用枯痔法进行治疗，共涂了九次枯痔散，不过十五天，那个长期折磨病人的痔核就完全脱落了。不久，病人愉快地出院了。病人后来给医院写了一封信说：“未作手术，痔疮就消失了，肠子也不脱出。虽然现在身体还弱，但我已能很方便地工作，再也不怕有脱肛的情形。我很愉快和很满意你们有这种疗法。”像希里索夫这样的病人，中医曾连续治好了许多。在一连串的事实面前，西医们轻视中医的思想开始转变，承认了中医是有丰富经验的，开始同中医在一起进行病例的研究和讨论，向中医学习中医治疗痔瘘的方法。从此，这个痔瘘医疗小组开始真正走上了中西医合作的道路。
      一九五四年初，四川成都九十多岁的著名中医痔瘘专家黄济川听说重庆医院里设立了中医痔瘘科，而且有他的学生参加治疗，还有西医在学习，他便来到重庆市第七人民医院观看和指导。这位老中医对痔瘘病症的治疗已有六十多年丰富的临床经验，但在旧社会，他受了封建保守思想的影响，他的重要临床经验和痔瘘有效药物的详细制法，从没有公开传授给别人。这次他在重庆市第七人民医院看到中西医合作治疗痔瘘的良好情形，并受到西医的尊重，他很感动，亲自烧枯痔散给病人上药，指导年青的中西医学习。以后，他回到了成都，在一九五四年的十月终于把自己六十多年来从未外传的治疗痔瘘的秘方和他的临床经验公开了。而重庆市第七人民医院中西医合作的痔瘘小组所采用的治疗痔瘘的方法，就吸取了他的丰富的临床治疗经验。
    这个痔瘘小组在重庆一年多的临床中，共治好了二百九十个痔疮患者和三百三十三个瘘管患者，他们的治疗成绩引起了各方面的重视。为了更好地传播中医治疗痔瘘的经验，在卫生部的重视下，重庆痔瘘医疗小组中的两个中医师、两个西医师在一九五四年九月被派到北京来传授经验。一九五四年十月他们在北京中央直属机关第六医院开始了医疗工作。从一九五四年十月到今年九月，他们用枯痔疗法和挂线疗法已经在北京治好了九百多个痔瘘病人。从这里可以看到中医治疗痔瘘方法的显著优点和疗效。这种疗效已经被参加学习的西医所承认。中央直属机关第六医院的外科大夫吴静波说：经过这次临床学习，我确实感到中医痔瘘疗法有许多优点，它不但效果显著，能够根治，而且治疗时间短，病人痛苦小，同时操作和设备也都简单，易于推广。特别是它不像西医手术疗法容易产生肛门狭小、肛门失禁等严重后遗症。目前北京许多外科医师都已学会了这一中医治疗痔瘘的方法，并已开始在自己所在的医院中进行临床治疗，取得了很好的成绩。
    由于中西医的密切合作，使中医治疗痔瘘的方法获得了新的发展。西医师帮助中医师们提高了治疗方法。例如病历的登记、病理的诊断、手术用具的应用、消毒和观察病情等，都应用了新的医学方法。尤其是在中药枯痔散的改良中，对解决中毒问题已有显著成绩。中药枯痔散中的白砒是一种毒性很强的药，涂在皮肤上容易发生疼痛和烧伤，有时分量使用稍不恰当，可能发生中毒情形。经过中西医合作研究后，他们在使用枯痔散时，一方面给病人施行奴佛卡因（麻醉剂）静脉注射，减除病人的疼痛。同时为了防止中毒，达到安全简单，容易掌握，经过反复研究，他们改进了枯痔散成分和制作方法。现在他们已初步试用白矾、胆矾、鸦胆子仁合制的枯痔散。这种枯痔散在临床上试用后，疗效还不错，完全可以避免中毒的危险。现正在进一步研究中。在中西医合作后，对瘘管的治疗上，也有了显著的进展。许多比较复杂的瘘管采用了中西医结合治疗的办法，即一方面施行手术，一方面挂线，疗效更好。
    中医治疗痔瘘的方法和经验是非常值得我国医学界重视的，它是世界各国治疗痔瘘病症的一种有效方法。这是我们祖先留传下来的宝贵的医学遗产，我们应该很好地学习研究和整理提高，使之进一步得到发展。重庆痔瘘医疗小组在这方面已做出了成绩，他们在传播中医治疗痔瘘的经验上，和西医学习中医，中西医团结合作，整理发扬祖国医学遗产方面，都树立了一个良好的范例。他们的经验告诉我们，只要中西医能亲密地团结合作，西医能够虚心学习中医，那么祖国丰富的医学遗产是会得到迅速的发展的。
