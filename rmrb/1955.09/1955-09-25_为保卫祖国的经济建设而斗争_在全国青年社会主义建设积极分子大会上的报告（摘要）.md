To Defend the Motherland's Economic Construction

——Report at the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism (Abstract)

Luo Ruiqing, Director of the First Office of the State Council and Minister of Public Security

With great excitement, I extend warm congratulations to the Congress and to all comrades! Congratulations to the heroes, models, and active builders of socialism from all fronts across the country for their brilliant achievements!

On July 30th of this year, the Second Session of the First National People's Congress formally adopted the first Five-Year Plan, a plan of great historical significance directly guided by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The implementation of this plan is a very glorious and very arduous task. In order to successfully complete this task, the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Party, the government, and our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, are working selflessly on all fronts of socialist construction.

Now, the convocation of the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism is a major event of great concern to the people of the whole country. The more than 1,500 active builders of socialism who have appeared at this Congress give people an extremely clear feeling: the broad masses of young people across the country have been mobilized urgently, responding to the call of the Party, the government, and Chairman Mao with heroic and active practical actions, and have set off a mass upsurge of socialist construction. We believe that the success of this meeting will bring new guarantees for the successful completion and overfulfillment of the first Five-Year Plan.

Comrades! I want to talk about an issue closely related to socialist construction, and an extremely important issue for ensuring the successful realization of socialist construction. This is: suppressing the activities of counter-revolutionaries and defending socialist construction.

In my speech at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, I said, "To tolerate the activities of counter-revolutionaries is to make it impossible to carry out socialist construction safely; to carry out socialist construction safely, we cannot tolerate the activities of counter-revolutionaries." I also listed some examples to illustrate why we made such a judgment. Today, I would also like to repeat this statement in front of the comrades, and I would like to explain in detail why we must resolutely struggle against counter-revolutionaries in order to build socialism.

As everyone knows, our socialist construction is being carried out in an environment surrounded by imperialism abroad and with the intensification of class struggle at home during the transition period.

Imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the remaining counter-revolutionaries in the country, and the reactionaries among the hostile classes, are they sleeping? Would they sit idly by while we carry out socialist construction and complete socialist construction? No, they will never sit idly by. Moreover, they are constantly watching us, constantly preparing for and carrying out various conspiracies and sabotage against the socialist construction of our people. They are always dreaming of one day restoring their rule on our liberated land.

The enemy's various conspiracies to sabotage our country are a sharp and life-and-death struggle against our revolutionary cause. Almost whatever we want to build, the enemy tries to sabotage.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, workers across the country are concentrating their efforts on industrial construction, especially heavy industry construction. Millions of young people have stood at the forefront of the struggle for the country's socialist industrialization, displaying a high degree of labor enthusiasm. Tens of thousands of young people, under the guidance of the Communist Youth League organizations, are responding to the call of the Party and the government and are joining the upsurge of labor competitions.

However, counter-revolutionaries hidden in factories, mines, and basic construction projects have adopted various despicable means: conspiring to burn down factories and mines, explode machinery and equipment, sabotage technological improvements, steal confidential intelligence, deliberately carry out erroneous construction, etc., attempting to delay and undermine our country's socialist industrialization through these insidious and vicious sabotage activities.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, farmers across the country are vigorously developing the agricultural production cooperative movement, organizing agricultural production cooperatives, and actively improving agricultural technology, increasing agricultural production, and using abundant agricultural products to support industrial construction. Now, all young farmers in our country are working with the farmers across the country to advance the socialist transformation of agriculture in the motherland, using hard work to build a new life in the countryside.

However, counter-revolutionaries hidden in the countryside are trying every possible means to sabotage the agricultural production cooperative movement and our unified purchase and sales policy. For this evil purpose, they do not hesitate to destroy crops, burn grain, poison draught animals, damage farm tools, or create rumors, sow discord, and use the superstitious psychology of some of the masses to sabotage production, even to the point of infiltrating our agricultural production cooperatives, usurping leadership, seizing important work, and conspiring to dismantle the agricultural production cooperatives from within, attempting to delay and undermine our country's socialist transformation of agriculture.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, people across the country are carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Young employees in private industrial and commercial enterprises, together with the broad masses of employees, are exemplarily implementing the Party's and the government's various policies, advancing the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

However, those counter-revolutionaries in the bourgeoisie who are determined to sabotage socialist transformation have carried out various despicable and shameless sabotage activities, such as destroying factory machinery, withdrawing funds, sabotaging processing and ordering, stealing economic intelligence, and even participating in the special agent organizations of imperialism and the Chiang gang, engaging in the heinous act of betraying the motherland.

Various hidden counter-revolutionaries are also carrying out various despicable sabotage activities aimed at our country's national defense construction, cultural construction, transportation construction, financial and trade facilities, and other socialist construction undertakings.

Various hidden counter-revolutionaries are not only sabotaging us from the outside, but also mainly attempting to sabotage us from the inside. Various hidden counter-revolutionaries not only wear various disguises and put on various masks, taking the opportunity to infiltrate and drill into our factories, mines, enterprises, schools, state organs, armed forces, cooperatives, mass organizations, democratic parties, and other organizations, but also try every possible means to sabotage our Party and the Communist Youth League. Counter-revolutionaries adopt the means of feigning enthusiasm and progress, and the tactics of being two-faced, drilling into our Communist Party and drilling into our Communist Youth League to carry out various sabotage activities. Many facts revealed in the recent struggles to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries in various places have further proved this despicable and shameless evil conspiracy of the enemy.

What should be particularly pointed out here is that counter-revolutionaries also carry out sabotage aimed at the weaknesses of some young people with weak wills. Counter-revolutionaries poison the minds of these young people, exploit their naivety, cater to their interests and hobbies, implement emotional enticement, and material inducement, so that these young people are first corrupted in their lives, and then further politically disintegrated, coerced, and framed. Or they pull them into reactionary small group activities manipulated by counter-revolutionaries, making these young people politically backward, dispirited, and even gradually degenerate to the path of counter-revolution; or they directly drag them down, push them into the quagmire of counter-revolutionary organizations, and use them to do counter-revolutionary things that sabotage socialist construction. This move is a very insidious and very vicious means of counter-revolutionaries. It is something we should pay special attention to.

Our Party and government are doing their best to educate young people, cultivating the moral qualities of young people who are loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to the revolutionary cause of socialism, while all counter-revolutionaries are doing everything possible to seduce and lure some young people to betray the motherland, betray the people, and betray the revolutionary cause of socialism.

Stalin said: "The youth are our future, they are our hope." But counter-revolutionaries are assassinating young people politically and morally, that is, assassinating our future and our hope. How insidious and vicious is this! Is this something we can tolerate?

A very small number of people, because they are numb and cannot see these vicious sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionaries, or because they do not have a firm revolutionary stand and cannot distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, when they see the people rise up to fight against the counter-revolutionaries and suppress the sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionaries, they doubtfully say, "Are we being too harsh on the counter-revolutionaries? Can we ease up a little?" Well then, from the above actual situation, it is the counter-revolutionaries who are too harsh on the people, it is the counter-revolutionaries who refuse to ease up on the people. Therefore, our struggle with the counter-revolutionaries must not waver.

It can be seen from this that anyone who hopes for the prosperity of our country, social progress, a stable and happy life for themselves, and the advancement of their young children cannot tolerate these counter-revolutionaries who have committed heinous crimes.

It can be seen from this that if we want to build a strong socialist country, we must defend socialist construction and we must thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. If we do not do this, the Chinese people will suffer and the cause of socialism will be sabotaged.

In recent months, starting from the struggle to expose and eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, in all parts of the country, within state organs, armed forces, people's organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, cultural and educational units, etc., in cities and rural areas, the broad masses of cadres and people have universally responded to the call of the Party, the government, and Chairman Mao, and have launched a vigorous movement to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. The socialist consciousness and revolutionary vigilance of the people have been greatly enhanced, everyone's eyes have been sharpened, and as a result, many counter-revolutionary cases have been cracked and a large number of hidden counter-revolutionaries have been cleared out. This is another serious blow to the remaining counter-revolutionaries.

The broad masses of young people, in this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, just as they have done on other fronts of socialist construction, have played an active role, displaying a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and a spirit of heroic and resolute struggle.

Wu Deyuan, a young seal-carving worker in Beijing, because he is always concerned about protecting the interests of the country and is vigilant against the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries, has reported and assisted public security organs in arresting a total of fifteen counter-revolutionaries and eighty-five criminal offenders in the past five years.

Li Zhongmin, a counter-revolutionary element in the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory who wore the guise of a "technical personnel," threw away several tons of chemicals, incited backward workers to go on strike, and sowed discord between workers and leaders, engaging in various sabotage activities. This counter-revolutionary element was discovered and exposed by Wang Pinyi, a young welding rod worker who was full of revolutionary vigilance.

Zhu Bangheng, a hidden counter-revolutionary element in the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Hubei Province, often created sabotage accidents under the cover of "low technical skills" and "lack of a sense of responsibility." The cunning sabotage activities of this counter-revolutionary element did not escape the sharp eyes of young worker Sun Hongyi. Sun Hongyi exposed seventeen sabotage accidents carried out by this counter-revolutionary element one by one, subjecting the counter-revolutionary element Zhu Bangheng to the punishment of the people's law.

What they did was completely right, and they deserve to be called outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people.

In the countryside, the heroic and resourceful actions of outstanding elements among the broad masses of young people in fighting against counter-revolutionaries are equally worthy of our praise.

Zhang Guifang, a female member of the Communist Youth League in Biyang County, Henan Province, discovered this spring that her husband, Fu Guangcheng, had been fooled by Li Bingzhao, the head of the reactionary secret society (Miaodao), and was lured to join the counter-revolutionary organization "Save the People's Army," and realized that the reactionary secret society was plotting to organize a riot, attempting to overthrow our people's regime, and vainly hoping to establish some kind of "Great Buddha Country." Therefore, Zhang Guifang compared her husband's life before and after liberation, and asked her husband Fu Guangcheng, "Have you forgotten your roots! Think about it, who benefits from what you are doing? What kind of person have you become!..." In this way, she finally saved her husband. Moreover, on the very day that this reactionary secret society was plotting a riot, she vigilantly and calmly learned about the specific situation of the enemy's activities and quickly reported it to the government. The enemy's plot to riot was crushed, and all the counter-revolutionary elements were caught.

Jin Xinge, a sixteen-year-old female member of the Communist Youth League in Gedong Street (Town), Taijiang County, Guizhou Province, when bandits robbed Gedong Street on June 10th of this year, tried every possible way to pass through the two blockades of the bandits, rushed to the county to report the situation, and helped the People's Public Security Forces to eliminate the bandits.

In the cities, there are many such examples as well. Li Yongchang, a member of the Communist Youth League in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, is a moving example of his heroic act of capturing a murderous special agent and sacrificing himself to save others. The matter was like this: just as the counter-revolutionary element Sun Dewen was wielding a knife to murder the people's police officer Zhang Zhimin, he fearlessly rushed forward to rescue him. Although he was cut several times by the counter-revolutionary element, he always grabbed this murderer and refused to let go. The murderous counter-revolutionary element was finally captured by the people because of this.

Our People's Army, they are not only heroes who defend the national defense, but also active fighters against espionage and counter-espionage. Zhao Yongqing, a soldier of a certain unit stationed in Lanzhou, based on his high vigilance and heroism and resourcefulness, once exposed a counter-revolutionary element who had sneaked into the army, attempted to collude with the enemy hidden in society, and plotted a riot, and a counter-revolutionary element who was preparing to sabotage weapons and win over backward soldiers to desert. Once when he was assigned the task of guarding prisoners, he personally captured a leader of the Yiguandao who was distributing reactionary leaflets and colluding with prisoners to carry out sabotage activities. Comrade Zhao Yongqing's exemplary deeds are just one of many outstanding fighters in the anti-espionage struggle of the youth in the army.

We also have many young people who, in the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, have undergone the test of struggle, and have shown a clear class stand and political line on the issue of revolution and counter-revolution, and are not shaken by the various threats and inducements of counter-revolutionaries, and do not violate the interests of the country and the people for personal gain. This expression of loyalty to the country and the people is also worthy of being promoted.

Comrades! I have talked about many exemplary deeds of young comrades in fighting against counter-revolutionaries, does it mean that in this struggle, the weaknesses and shortcomings of some of our young people have not been exposed at the same time? No, it is not like that. In order to combat the various conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries, and in order to defend the full realization of the first Five-Year Plan, on the one hand, we must greatly promote the advantages of our youth, and at the same time, we must strive to overcome our own weaknesses and shortcomings, and some of our youth do have serious weaknesses and shortcomings in the face of the conspiracies and tricks of counter-revolutionaries.

For example, the idea of peace and paralysis is still very serious among some young comrades. In the minds of these comrades, there are still various naive ideas. For example, some people say, "We young people are very simple, and are not the target of counter-revolutionaries." Is this statement correct? Let me answer with the facts! There was a maintenance worker at the wired broadcasting station in Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, named Xiong Fang, who was twenty-five years old, from a free professional family, and had a high school education. It can be said that he was a "simple" young man. But counter-revolutionaries did not fail to see him as a target because of this. This young man was targeted by Zhao Ruirong (female), a counter-revolutionary element who had infiltrated the interior, because he pursued personal enjoyment in life and lacked a proper attitude towards relations between men and women. The two of them hooked up and often ate, drank, and had fun together. After the counter-revolutionary element Zhao Ruirong deceived this young man, she fled to Hong Kong and, in the Chiang bandit secret service, constantly wrote letters to him in the form of love letters, and finally seduced Xiong Fang into the water, causing him to do many bad things for the Chiang bandit secret service and becoming a sinner of the motherland and the people.

Some young comrades also say: "Our factory is full of young people, with simple histories and uncomplicated social relations, and there will be no problems." Or they say: "Our factory is full of old workers, everyone has been getting along for five or six years, we are all familiar with each other, there will be no problems." In short, these people believe that "there are no counter-revolutionaries in my place, there are no problems." Comrades, think about it, are these arguments correct? Let me ask, where did the counter-revolutionary element Li Zhongmin of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory and the counter-revolutionary element Zhu Bangheng of the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Hubei Province come from? Aren't the many facts of sabotage by counter-revolutionaries recently revealed in various places enough to refute this numb and inhuman argument? In fact, the place where this kind of paralysis exists is precisely where counter-revolutionaries can easily hide!

In February 1955, Tianjin City arrested a counter-revolutionary political swindler whose name was Dong Weijun. This Dong Weijun had pretended to be a cadre of the Tianjin Federation of Students and went to Nankai University, Tianjin University, Tianjin Medical College, Nursing School, No. 3 Girls' High School, No. 6 Girls' High School, and other universities and secondary schools to contact the heads of student unions in each school to learn about the number of teachers and students, the organization of the Communist Youth League, the situation of foreign students and overseas Chinese students, and the students' vacation activities, etc. Although this swindler did not have the trickery of Li Wanming, he did not even forge any documents, but he still barged around as if he was in no man's land, and was warmly received by the heads of student unions in each school, who gave him detailed information, and even prepared to make written reports to him. Later, this swindler pretended to be a member of the Communist Youth League and the propaganda minister of the student union of Hebei Normal College. A female youth in a certain organ became acquainted with him through dancing, and actually fell in love with this swindler.

Comrades, are these lessons not worth being vigilant about? This incident shows that there is indeed a serious state of paralysis in our school educational institutions and among our intellectual youth.

Perhaps some people think that what I said above are all urban situations. The rural situation is different, and rural youth will not be the target of counter-revolutionaries, right! This statement is also incorrect. On July 16th of this year, "China Youth Daily" published a very educational case. Lin Qiurong, who had been the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch and the director of the Township Security Committee of Huangshi Township, Shangrao County, Jiangxi Province, a youth from a poor peasant family, how was he dragged into the water by counter-revolutionaries step by step? It was nothing else, he was only initially eroded by bourgeois ideology, did not like to participate in labor, paid attention to ostentation, paid attention to eating and wearing, and then gradually became a "three-handed," embezzling public funds, and finally, he was regarded as a "treasure" by counter-revolutionaries and was pulled into the counter-revolutionary organization.

In addition, there are some young people who, in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, show a vague stand, cannot distinguish between political right and wrong, and cannot distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. Some show wavering in the struggle, some adopt a so-called "neutral attitude," and some even express "sympathy" for counter-revolutionaries. People with these serious weaknesses, if they are not vigilant and corrected, are likely to develop to the point of losing their stand and being exploited by the enemy.

There are also some young people who, because they are also somewhat stained with the filth of the old society, have also said some lies in politics more or less. However, because they are not highly aware, they do not have the courage to be loyal and frank to the organization for a while, and to correct their mistakes, so they carry a burden. This is very wrong and very dangerous. This is not only because the false is false, and the false will always be exposed, and paper cannot contain fire; but also because people with this weakness are often regarded by counter-revolutionaries as good targets for "winning over" and "liaison." There was a youth named Yang Shibin in Changning Middle School in Shanghai. He had participated in a reactionary small group manipulated by counter-revolutionaries. This is certainly wrong, but if he could confess honestly, it would not be a big deal. However, when he was accepted into the Communist Youth League, he concealed this matter. If he had confessed this matter to the organization after joining the League, it would not have been too late, but he still lacked the quality and courage of being loyal and honest to the organization. He deceived himself and thought, "I'll hide it if I can, anyway, I won't participate in the small group anymore." What was the result? Counter-revolutionary elements Zhang Weishan and Jin Zhongbin, etc., seized this disloyal and dishonest Yang Shibin, and wanted him to "strive to be an extraordinary person." Yang Shibin thought that Zhang Weishan, Jin Zhongbin, and other counter-revolutionary elements already knew about his past activities, and his weakness was in the hands of others, and he thought that he could not get rid of the control of counter-revolutionary elements. As a result, this Yang Shibin, who deceived the organization, became a prisoner of counter-revolutionary elements and became a counter-revolutionary element. A person, if he is not loyal and honest to the organization, if he tells lies in politics, and insists on not correcting this mistake, he is bound to ruin his own future. This is a serious lesson.

Comrades, you are all outstanding representatives selected by the broad masses of young people, so you should not only be good at carrying out socialist construction, but also be good at defending socialist construction; you should not only become active participants in socialist construction, but also become active participants in defending socialist construction; you should not only become examples for the broad masses of young people in the struggle to carry out socialist construction, but also become examples for the broad masses of young people in the struggle to defend socialist construction.

You should, through your own exemplary leading role, strive to overcome the kind of peaceful and paralyzed thinking in some young people mentioned earlier, overcome various types of bourgeois individualism in some young people, and overcome the errors of vague or even lost positions in some young people.

You should, through your own exemplary leading role, lead the broad masses of young people to more actively participate in the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, and in the struggle, test yourselves, train yourselves, and improve your political awareness and class consciousness, so that you will always be loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to the great cause of socialism.

Comrades! The current struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements is unfolding across the country, and we must continue this struggle, persist in it, until we achieve complete victory. We must eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, and we can also eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements.

We say that we can eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, and we can achieve complete victory in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, because: our cause is just, it represents the interests of the broad masses of the people, and therefore it will inevitably gain the support of the broad masses of the people. The power of the people's revolution is the new, nascent, and great power of human progress; while counter-revolutionary elements are reactionary, declining, they are the running dogs of imperialism, and they are public enemies of the people across the country. They are only a very small number and are in an extremely isolated position among the people. The great Chinese people, who have already stood up, are fully capable of overcoming and eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements. Historical laws show that all reactionary classes and counter-revolutionary elements are doomed to perish, this is their inevitable destiny.

We say that we can achieve complete victory in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, also because we have the following necessary conditions for victory.

What are these necessary conditions for victory?

First of all, we have ample time to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements. It is impossible for any counter-revolutionary element to escape the past and hide it. With the continuous development of our socialist revolution, the continuous improvement of the political awareness and revolutionary vigilance of the broad masses of the people, it is impossible for any counter-revolutionary element to escape the dragnet of the people. Even if they are not discovered today, they will be discovered tomorrow; if they are not discovered this year, they will be discovered next year. After the launch of this mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, various places have cracked some counter-revolutionary cases that could not be cracked for a long time in the past. Even the most cunning counter-revolutionary elements who changed their names, changed their appearances, fled east and west, falsely reported their deaths, and hid in hidden walls and tunnels, deep in the mountains and wild caves, have also been discovered and captured. Have not those relatively hidden counter-revolutionary elements who used two-faced tactics to hide within our ranks, such as Hu Feng, who hid in the revolutionary camp for more than 20 years, and Pan Hannian and Yang Fan, who hid in our Party for many years, also been exposed?

Secondly, we have sufficient materials to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. Some counter-revolutionary elements often think that others do not know about their criminal activities, and think that we do not have materials in hand to prove their crimes, so they stubbornly resist and deny them. However, they have forgotten that the people will rise up to expose them; some people in the counter-revolutionary organization who do not want to continue to be counter-revolutionary will also confess them; especially, it has been six years since the national liberation, and we have not only mastered many materials about the past and present activities of counter-revolutionary elements, but we can also conduct thorough and detailed investigation and research work. Therefore, any attempt by counter-revolutionary elements to stubbornly resist and deny is useless. I think that all the comrades who have participated in this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements have almost personally seen that some counter-revolutionary elements made various sophistries at the beginning of the struggle, attempting to divert attention; then, they carried out various shameless denials and resistance, attempting to muddle through; finally, when we presented the materials we had, the counter-revolutionary elements had to bow their heads and admit their guilt in the face of conclusive evidence. There are many such facts.

Thirdly, our struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements, in addition to the two important conditions of ample time and sufficient materials mentioned earlier, also has a more important condition for achieving victory, that is, we have the correct guidelines and correct policies formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

What are our guidelines? They are the guidelines that we have repeatedly talked about in the past, Chairman Mao instructed us: "Raise vigilance, eliminate all special agents; prevent deviations, do not wrong a good person," that is, implement the guidelines of "relying on the correct guidance of the leading organs and the high awareness of the broad masses." What is our policy? It is to continue to implement the policy of "combining suppression and leniency."

Our policy of combining suppression and leniency, specifically speaking, is: leniency for confession, severity for resistance. It is better to confess than not to confess, and it is better to report bad people than not to report them. Those who confess, those who should be sentenced to death can be exempted from the death penalty, those who should be sentenced to heavy punishment can have their sentences reduced, those who perform meritorious service can offset their crimes with meritorious service, and those who perform great meritorious service can be rewarded. Those who do not confess must be severely punished according to law. Acting in accordance with this policy not only makes those counter-revolutionary elements who are determined to be enemies of the people and engage in sabotage activities receive the punishment they deserve, but also points out a bright way out for those counter-revolutionary elements who are willing to confess and repent.

Our Communist Party and the People's Government have always been consistent in word and deed. We do what we say. Our policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionary elements has long been universally implemented across the country, and has achieved remarkable results.

Xie Kunlin, a hidden counter-revolutionary element in the Nanjing Municipal Store Employees' Union, had joined the Chiang bandit and Wang puppet army as early as the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, and had done many counter-revolutionary and anti-people things, with considerable crimes and popular resentment. After liberation, he fabricated his history, concealed his crimes, and successively infiltrated the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Handicraft Industry Federation, and the Nanjing Municipal Store Employees' Union. If he had thoroughly confessed his crimes, repented of his past mistakes, and started anew, he could still have been given lenient treatment. However, this counter-revolutionary element has been hiding it all the time, refusing to confess, superficially pretending to be active, deceiving the trust of the leadership, and secretly colluding with special agents to carry out various sabotage activities. When this struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements began, everyone exposed his counter-revolutionary face, so he hated the Communist Party even more, hated the People's Government, hated the masses of the people, and hated all revolutionary cadres. On the afternoon of August 5th of this year, this counter-revolutionary element took advantage of everyone's afternoon nap and, armed with two knives, broke into the Financial and Trade Committee of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and continuously slashed and wounded four party member cadres, Wang Fuyin, Wu Shujian (female), Du Xiumei (female), and Zhang Rude (female), and cut off the neck blood vessels of Communist Youth League member Sun Yuankai. Comrades Wang Fuyin and others fought fiercely with the counter-revolutionary element Xie Kunlin and captured Xie on the spot. Because this counter-revolutionary element was unrepentant, refused to confess, and even dared to commit murder, the Nanjing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, in accordance with the policy of severity for resistance, sentenced the criminal to death on August 11th of this year in accordance with the law, and executed him immediately.

This is the shameful road taken by those counter-revolutionary elements who are determined to be enemies of the country and the people and resist to the end.

However, for counter-revolutionary elements, there is also another bright path that is the opposite of this.

Wang Huimin, a counter-revolutionary element who had infiltrated the Yuanchang Engineering Team of the former Municipal Engineering Bureau of Tianjin City, had also joined the puppet army during the Anti-Japanese War, and had also served as a squad leader, often going to the countryside to grab grain and harass the masses.

In the autumn of 1942, he killed one of our army's staff members, and later forced laborers to build bunkers, and instructed the puppet army to beat and injure a farmer named Xu Enxi to death. If we look at the historical crimes of this counter-revolutionary element Wang Huimin, his crimes are even more serious than those of the counter-revolutionary element Xie Kunlin mentioned earlier, because Wang committed crimes that caused both popular anger and blood debt, and logically he should be sentenced to death. However, because he voluntarily and thoroughly confessed his crimes and showed signs of repentance, the Military Control Commission Military Law Office of Tianjin City, in accordance with the policy of leniency for confession and the laws of the state, lightly sentenced the criminal to ten years of imprisonment on September 12.

This is what is said about counter-revolutionary elements with historical crimes, so what about counter-revolutionary elements with real crimes?

There was a counter-revolutionary element named Xing Zhonglie who had joined the New People's Association intelligence team, a traitorous organization, before liberation, and had also joined the Kuomintang's special agent organization "Traitor Elimination Team," collected intelligence on our Party's work, and used his power to oppress the people. After liberation, he concealed these criminal histories, infiltrated Tianjin No. 25 Middle School as a staff member, spread reactionary remarks in the school, and also hid guns and bullets. His crimes were also very serious. However, this counter-revolutionary element Xing Zhonglie, under the call of the People's Government's policy, thoroughly confessed his crimes, and voluntarily handed over two hidden pistols, more than 500 bullets, and some reactionary books and periodicals. Therefore, the government not only exempted this counter-revolutionary element from the criminal punishment he should have received, but also allowed him to continue to work in the school to see the effect.

There was a U.S.-Chiang special agent named Liu Zhongliang who joined the Chiang bandit special agent organization "Security Bureau" as a special agent in Hong Kong in the summer of 1952, and joined the U.S. imperialism "Far East Intelligence Bureau" as a spy in the spring of 1953. In August 1954, he also joined the Chiang bandit "Central Committee" special agent organization, and carried out many evil activities in Hong Kong that betrayed the motherland. In early October 1954, he was sent back by the Chiang bandit special agent agency, carrying special agent work plans and secret writing powder, and plotted to return to the motherland to carry out sabotage activities. However, after returning to the country, this special agent, due to seeing the progressive scene of the motherland, receiving education from the government, and at the same time, his parents and relatives also promoted the government's policy of leniency to him, so he repented, and on October 9, 1954, his father led him to surrender to the local public security organ, handed over his special agent evidence, and received lenient treatment from the government, and was sentenced to three years of control, and went home to work in production and start anew.

Similar things can be cited a lot.

From the treatment received by these counter-revolutionary elements, today, two paths are clearly laid out in front of all counter-revolutionary elements: one is the shameful dead end taken by counter-revolutionary elements who attempt to resist; the other is the bright path of life taken by counter-revolutionary elements who voluntarily confess and explain their problems. The only way out for all counter-revolutionary elements is to voluntarily confess and thoroughly explain their problems.

From the above-mentioned situations and examples, it is further illustrated that as long as we can fully utilize various favorable conditions, and can earnestly implement the correct guidelines and policies for suppressing counter-revolutionaries stipulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to achieve the purpose of thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements.

In order to enable each of our young people to play a greater role in the current struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, and in the long-term struggle to defend the socialist construction of the motherland in the future, I would also like to put forward the following hopes:

We hope that the young people on the industrial front will exemplarily abide by labor discipline, strictly implement various systems and operating procedures, work hard to learn technology, become proficient in their industry, not only ensure that they do not have accidents, but also help others prevent accidents, and when accidents have already occurred, actively assist the leadership in investigating all suspicious accidents. Actively participate in anti-espionage and security work, prevent and combat all sabotage activities carried out by counter-revolutionary elements aimed at our industrial construction.

We hope that the young people on the agricultural front will actively implement the Party and the state's policies for developing the agricultural cooperative movement, help the leadership to purify and consolidate the organization of the cooperative, actively participate in doing a good job in supervising the reactionary landlord class elements and controlling counter-revolutionary elements, and prevent and combat all sabotage activities carried out by counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary landlords and rich peasant elements aimed at our agricultural production cooperative movement.

We hope that the young people in the People's Army and the People's Police will stand firm in their posts, hold their weapons tightly, raise vigilance, and defend the motherland. Not only be good at waging heroic struggles against the open enemy with guns, but also learn to wage brave and resourceful struggles against the hidden enemy.

We hope that the intellectual youth will not only work hard to learn natural science, but also work hard to learn Marxism-Leninism, work hard to learn Comrade Mao Zedong's works, improve their political awareness, actively participate in practical struggles, closely integrate with the workers and peasants, improve revolutionary vigilance, and learn to fight against all disguised counter-revolutionary elements wearing various disguises.

We hope that the young people in state organs, mass organizations, and other various work positions will perform their duties to the best of their ability, raise vigilance, overcome paralysis, tighten systems, strengthen secrecy, prevent bad people from infiltrating, and combat the conspiracies and sabotage

    为保卫祖国的经济建设而斗争
    ——在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上的报告（摘要）
    国务院第一办公室主任兼公安部长　罗瑞卿
    我以十分兴奋的心情向大会、向同志们表示热烈的祝贺！祝贺来自全国各个战线的英雄们、模范们、社会主义建设积极分子们的光辉成就！
    今年七月三十日，在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，正式通过了党中央和毛主席直接指导制定的有伟大历史意义的第一个五年计划。这个计划的实现，是一个十分光荣、十分艰巨的任务。为了胜利地完成这个任务，全国人民在党、政府和我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导下，正在社会主义建设的各个战线上，奋不顾身地工作着。
    现在，全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的召开，是一个全国人民十分关心的重大事件，出现在这次大会上的一千五百多位社会主义建设积极分子，更给了人们这样一种极其鲜明的感觉：全国广大青年群众，已经紧张地动员起来，以英勇积极的实际行动，来响应党、政府和毛主席的号召，掀起了社会主义建设的群众性的热潮。我们相信，这次会议的成功，将给我们完成和超额完成第一个五年计划带来新的胜利的保证。
    同志们！我要讲的，是同社会主义建设有密切关系的一个问题，也是保证社会主义建设胜利实现的一个极其重要的问题。这就是：镇压反革命分子的活动，保卫社会主义的建设。
    我在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中曾经这样说过：“要容忍反革命分子的活动，就不能安全地进行社会主义的建设；要安全地进行社会主义的建设，就不能容忍反革命分子的活动。”我并列举了一些事例来说明我们为什么要作出这样的论断。今天我还愿意在同志们面前重复地提到这一论断，并愿意详细地说明一下为什么为了建设社会主义就必须同反革命分子进行坚决斗争的道理。
    大家都知道，我国的社会主义建设，是在国外帝国主义包围的环境下，和国内过渡时期阶级斗争更加尖锐化的情况下进行的。
    帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团，国内残余的反革命分子和敌对阶级中的反动分子，他们并没有在那里睡觉，难道他们会坐视我们进行社会主义建设和完成社会主义建设吗？不，他们决不会坐视的。而且他们时时刻刻都在窥伺着我们，时时刻刻都在对我国人民的社会主义建设，准备进行和正在进行各种阴谋破坏，他们总是梦想着有一天要在我们解放了的国土上复辟。
    敌人破坏我们国家的各种阴谋活动，是同我们的革命事业针锋相对的、你死我活的斗争。几乎我们要建设什么，敌人就企图来破坏什么。
    全国工人，在党和政府的领导下，正在集中力量进行工业建设，特别是重工业建设。几百万青年站到为国家的社会主义工业化而斗争的前列，发挥了高度的劳动热情。成千成万的青年，在青年团组织的引导下，正在响应党和政府的号召，卷入劳动竞赛的热潮。
    可是，暗藏在工矿企业和基本建设中的反革命分子，却采取了各种卑鄙手段：阴谋焚烧工厂矿山，爆炸机器设备，破坏技术改进，偷窃机密情报，故意实行错误施工，等等，企图用这些阴险毒辣的破坏，来推迟和搞垮我国社会主义工业化的事业。
    全国农民，在党和政府的领导下，正在以大力发展农业生产合作化运动，组织农业生产合作社，正在积极改进农业技术，增加农业生产，用丰富的农产品来支援工业建设。现在，我国全体青年农民正在和全国农民一起，把祖国的农业社会主义改造事业推向前进，用辛勤的劳动来建设农村中的新生活。
    可是，暗藏在农村中的反革命分子，他们正在想方设法来破坏农业生产合作化运动，破坏我们的统购统销政策。为了这个罪恶目的，他们不惜毁坏庄稼，烧掉粮食，毒害耕畜，破坏农具，或者制造谣言，挑拨离间，利用部分群众的迷信心理破坏生产，以至于钻进我们农业生产合作社里来，篡夺领导，把持重要工作，阴谋从内部来拆农业生产合作社的台，企图推迟和搞垮我国农业社会主义改造的事业。
    全国人民，在党和政府的领导下，正在对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造。在私营工商业中的青年职工和广大职工一起，正在模范地执行党和政府的各项政策，将国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造事业推向前进。
    可是，资产阶级中那些坚决破坏社会主义改造的反革命分子，他们却进行了各种卑鄙无耻的破坏，如毁坏工厂机器，抽逃资金，破坏加工订货，盗窃经济情报，甚至参加帝国主义和蒋匪帮的特务组织，进行背叛祖国的罪恶活动。
    各种暗藏的反革命分子还针对着我国的国防建设、文化建设、交通建设、财经贸易设施等各项社会主义建设事业，进行着各种卑鄙的破坏活动。
    各种暗藏的反革命分子，并不只是从外部来破坏我们的，而且主要的是企图从内部来对我们进行破坏。各种暗藏的反革命分子，不仅披着各种外衣，戴上各种假面具，乘隙混入和钻进我们的工厂、矿山、企业、学校、国家机关、军队、合作社、群众团体、民主党派等组织中，而且想尽一切办法来破坏我们的党和青年团。反革命分子采取假积极、假进步的手段，采取两面派的手法，钻进我们的共产党里来，钻进我们的青年团里来，进行各种破坏。从最近各地在肃清暗藏反革命分子的斗争中所揭发出来的许多事实来看，更证明了敌人的这种卑鄙无耻的罪恶阴谋。
    在这里，应当特别提出的，是反革命分子还针对着某些意志薄弱的青年人的弱点，进行破坏。反革命分子对这些青年进行思想放毒，利用他们的幼稚，投合他们的兴趣和爱好，实行感情拉拢，物质引诱，使这些青年首先在生活上腐化下来，然后，进一步在政治上瓦解他们，胁迫他们，陷害他们。或者拉他们参加反革命分子所操纵的反动小集团活动，使这些青年政治落后，意志消沉，甚至逐步堕落到反革命的道路上去；或者直接把他们拉下水，推向反革命组织的泥坑，利用他们做破坏社会主义建设的反革命勾当。这一着，是反革命分子十分阴险、十分恶毒的手段。是我们应当特别引起警惕的。
    我们的党和政府正在尽力教育青年，培养青年忠于祖国、忠于人民、忠于社会主义的革命事业的道德品质，而一切反革命分子却千方百计地勾引和诱惑某些青年人背叛祖国，背叛人民，背叛社会主义的革命事业。
    斯大林说：“青年是我们的将来，是我们的希望。”而反革命分子却在政治上和道德上来谋杀青年，也就是谋杀我们的未来和我们的希望。这是多么阴险毒辣！这难道是我们能够容忍的吗？
    有极少数的人因为自己麻木不仁，看不见反革命分子这些狠毒的破坏活动，或者因为自己没有坚定的革命立场，划不清敌我界限，当看到人民群众起来向反革命分子作斗争，和镇压反革命分子的破坏活动的时候，他们怀疑地说：“对反革命分子太厉害了吧，缓和一点行不行呢？”那吗，从以上这些实际情况来看，是反革命对人民太厉害，是反革命对人民不肯缓和。所以，我们同反革命分子的斗争决不能动摇。
    由此可见，任何希望我国国家富强、社会进步，希望自己生活安定和幸福，希望自己的青年子弟上进的人，对于这些罪恶滔天的反革命分子，都是不能容忍的。
    由此可见，我们要建设社会主义的强大国家，就一定要保卫社会主义建设，就一定要把一切反革命分子彻底肃清。如果不这样办，中国人民就要遭殃，社会主义的事业就要遭受破坏。
    最近几个月来，从揭露和肃清胡风反革命集团的斗争开始，全国各地，在国家机关、武装部队、人民团体、工矿企业、文化教育等等单位的内部，在城市和农村中，广大干部和人民群众普遍响应了党、政府和毛主席的号召，大张旗鼓地开展了肃清一切反革命分子的运动。人民群众的社会主义觉悟和革命警惕性大大提高了，大家的眼睛擦亮了，因而，许多反革命案件被破获了，大批暗藏的反革命分子被清查出来了。这是给残余反革命分子的又一次严重的打击。
    广大的青年，在这次肃清反革命分子的斗争中，正如他们在社会主义建设的其他战线上一样，起了积极的作用，表现了高度的革命警惕性和英勇果敢的斗争精神。
    北京市青年刻字工人吴德元，由于他时时刻刻都在关心保卫国家利益，警惕着反革命分子的破坏，所以他在过去的五年当中，一共检举和协助公安机关捕获了十五个反革命分子，八十五个刑事犯罪分子。
    沈阳矿山机器厂一个披着“技术人员”外衣的反革命分子李仲民，把几吨化学药品扔掉，煽动落后工人怠工，挑拨工人和领导的团结，进行各种破坏活动。这个反革命分子，就是被富有革命警惕性的青年焊条工人王品一发现和揭露出来的。
    湖北省江岸机车车辆修理厂暗藏的反革命分子朱邦恒，经常在“技术不高”、“责任心不强”的掩盖下，制造破坏事故。这个反革命分子的狡猾的破坏活动，没有逃过青年工人孙洪义的雪亮的眼睛。孙洪义把这个反革命分子所进行的十七件破坏事故，一件一件都揭发了。使反革命分子朱邦恒受到了人民法律的惩办。
    他们这样作是完全对的，他们不愧称为中国人民的优秀儿女。
    在农村中，广大青年中的优秀分子，同反革命分子进行斗争的英勇机智的行为，同样是值得我们加以称赞的。
    河南省泌阳县有一个女青年团员张桂芳，今年春天，发现自己的丈夫傅广成上了反动会道门（庙道）头子李炳照的当，被诱骗参加了反革命组织“救民军”，并发觉反动会道门阴谋组织暴乱，企图颠覆我人民政权，妄想建立什么“大佛国”。于是张桂芳就向自己的丈夫对比解放前后的生活，并追问她丈夫傅广成说：“你忘了本！你想，你这样做对谁有利？你成了什么人！……”就这样，她终于把自己的丈夫挽救了过来。并且，正当这个反动会道门阴谋暴动的当天，她机警沉着地了解了敌人活动的具体情况，迅速报告了政府。敌人的暴动阴谋被粉碎了，全部反革命分子都落网了。
    贵州省台江县革东街（镇）有一个十六岁的女青年团员金星鹅，当今年六月十日土匪抢劫革东街的时候，她想尽各种办法，通过了土匪的两道封锁，急奔到县里报告情况，帮助人民公安部队消灭了土匪。
    在城市里，这样的事例也是很多的。浙江省温州市青年团员李永昌，捕捉行凶特务，舍己救人的英雄行为，就是一个动人的例子。事情是这样的：正当反革命分子孙德文持刀行凶，谋杀人民警察张志敏时，他奋不顾身地猛扑过去营救，虽然自己被反革命分子砍了几刀，但他始终抓住这个凶犯不放，这个行凶的反革命分子终于因此被人民捕获。
    我们的人民军队，他们既是保卫国防的英雄，又是防奸反特的积极战士。驻兰州某部队战士赵永庆，凭着他的高度警惕和英勇机智，曾经揭发了一个混入部队、企图勾结暗藏在社会上的敌人、阴谋暴动的反革命分子，和一个准备破坏武器、拉拢落后战士开小差的反革命分子。当他有一次担任看管罪犯的任务时，还亲手擒获了一个散发反动传单、勾结罪犯进行破坏活动的一贯道头子。赵永庆同志的模范事迹就是部队青年在反奸斗争中许多杰出的战士中的一个。
    我们还有许多青年，他们在肃清反革命分子的运动中，经过了斗争的考验，在革命同反革命的问题上，表现了有明确的阶级立场和政治界限，不为反革命分子的各种威胁利诱所动摇，不为个人利害而违背国家和人民的利益，这种对国家、对人民的忠诚表现，也是值得发扬的。
    同志们！我说了很多青年同志们在同反革命分子作斗争中的模范事迹，是不是就等于说在这个斗争中就没有同时暴露出我们某些青年人的弱点和缺点呢？不是的，不是这样的。为了打击反革命分子的各种阴谋活动，为了保卫第一个五年计划的全部实现，我们一方面要大大发扬我们青年的优点，同时，我们必须努力克服我们自己的弱点和缺点，而我们有些青年在反革命分子的阴谋诡计面前，确实还有严重的弱点和缺点。
    譬如说：太平麻痹思想在一些青年同志中还是很严重的。在这些同志的头脑中，还存在着各种各样的天真的想法。比如有人说：“我们青年人很单纯，不是反革命下手的对象。”这种说法对不对呢？让我拿事实来回答吧！广东省韶关市有线广播站有个机务员叫熊方，二十五岁，出身自由职业家庭，高中文化程度，本来可以说是一个“单纯”的青年。但反革命分子并不因为这点就不把他看成下手的对象。这个青年人因为追求个人生活享受，对男女关系缺乏正当的态度，就被混进内部的反革命分子赵瑞容（女）看上了。两个人勾搭在一起，经常吃喝玩乐。反革命分子赵瑞容骗上这个青年后，自己就逃往香港，并在蒋匪特务机关，利用写情书的方式，不断给他写信，终于勾引熊方下了水，使他替蒋匪特务机关做了许多坏事，变成了祖国和人民的罪人。
    又有一些青年同志说：“我们厂内全是青年，历史简单，社会关系又不复杂，不会有问题。”或者说：“我们厂内都是老工人，大家相处五、六年，我们全都熟悉，不会有啥问题的。”总之，这些人认为“我这个地方是没有反革命的，是没有问题的。”请同志们想一想，这些论调是正确的吗？试问沈阳矿山机器厂的反革命分子李仲民，湖北省江岸机车车辆修理厂的反革命分子朱邦恒是从那里来的呢？难道最近各地所揭发的许多反革命进行破坏的事实，还不能驳倒这种麻木不仁的论调吗？实际上，存在着这种麻痹思想的地方，正是反革命分子容易躲藏的地方啊！
    一九五五年二月，天津市逮捕了一个反革命政治骗子，它的名字叫董维均。这个董维均曾冒充天津市学联的干部，先后到南开大学、天津大学、天津医学院、护士学校、女三中、女六中等大、中学校里去，与各校学生会负责人接洽，了解各校师生人数、青年团组织情况、留学生和华侨学生情况以及学生假期活动，等等。虽然这个骗子手还没有李万铭那样的骗术，他甚至没有伪造任何证件，但是，他还是横冲直撞，如入无人之境，并且受到了各校学生会负责人的热情招待，详细介绍情况，甚至还准备向他作书面报告。后来这个骗子手又冒充是青年团员、河北师范学院学生会的宣传部长，某机关有一位女青年因跳舞和他相识，竟然就同这个骗子手谈起恋爱来了。
    同志们，这样的教训，难道还不值得引起警惕吗？这个事件说明，在我们的学校教育机关，在我们的知识青年中间，确实存在着严重的麻痹思想。
    也许有人以为我上面说的都是城市的情形。农村情况不同，农村青年不会是反革命下手的对象吧！这种说法也是不对的。今年七月十六日“中国青年报”发表了一个很有教育意义的案件。曾当过江西省上饶县黄市乡的团支部书记、乡治安保卫委员会主任的林裘荣，这个贫农出身的青年，他是怎样一步一步地被反革命分子拉下水的呢？不是别的，开始时他仅仅是受到了资产阶级的思想侵蚀，不爱参加劳动，讲排场，讲吃穿，于是就逐渐变成了“三只手”，贪污公款，最后，被反革命分子当成“宝贝”，拉进了反革命组织。
    此外，还有一些青年，在肃清反革命分子的斗争中，表现立场模糊，分不清政治上的是非，分不清敌我界限。有的在斗争中表现动摇，有的采取所谓“中立态度”，有的甚至对反革命分子表示“同情”，有这些严重弱点的人，如不加以警惕和改正，就很可能发展到丧失立场和被敌人利用的地步。
    也还有一些青年，因为自己也多少沾染了一些旧社会的污毒，在政治上也或多或少说过一些假话。但是因为自己觉悟不高，一时没有勇气对组织忠诚坦白，修正自己的错误，因而背上了包袱。这是很不对的，而且是很危险的。这不仅仅是因为假的就是假的，假的是始终要被戳穿的，纸里是包不住火的；而且因为有这种弱点的人，常常会被反革命分子看成为进行“争取”“联络”的好对象。上海长宁中学有一个青年，名叫杨士斌，他曾经参加过为反革命分子所操纵的反动小集团。这当然是错误的，但如果他能坦白交代，还不算一件大不了的事情，可是当他被接收加入青年团的时候，把这件事情隐瞒了。如果入团以后，就向组织交代这个问题，也还是不算太晚，但是他仍然缺乏对组织忠诚老实的品质和勇气。他自欺欺人地想：“能隐瞒住就隐瞒了吧，反正我再不参加小集团了。”结果怎样呢？反革命分子张维珊和金忠彬等人，抓住了这个不忠诚不老实的杨士斌，要他“争取作一个不平凡的人”。杨士斌想到张维珊、金忠彬等反革命分子已经知道了自己过去的活动，把柄在人家手里，认为无法摆脱反革命分子的控制。结果这个欺骗组织的杨士斌，就当了反革命分子的俘虏，变成反革命分子了。一个人，如果对组织不忠诚，不老实，如果政治上说假话，又坚持不改正这个错误，是一定要自己毁坏自己的前途的。这是一个严重的教训。
    同志们，你们都是广大青年群众所选拔出来的优秀代表，因此，你们不仅应当善于进行社会主义建设，而且应当善于保卫社会主义建设；你们不仅应当成为进行社会主义建设的积极分子，而且应当成为保卫社会主义建设的积极分子；你们不仅应当在进行社会主义建设的斗争中成为广大青年的榜样，而且应当在保卫社会主义建设的斗争中成为广大青年的榜样。
    你们应当通过自己的模范带头作用去努力克服前面说过的某些青年中的那种太平麻痹思想，克服某些青年中各种各色的资产阶级个人主义，克服某些青年中那种立场模糊，甚至丧失立场的错误。
    你们应当通过自己的模范带头作用去领导广大青年更积极地参加肃清一切反革命分子的斗争，并在斗争中去考验自己，锻炼自己，提高自己的政治觉悟和阶级觉悟，使自己永远忠于祖国，忠于人民，忠于社会主义的伟大事业。
    同志们！目前全国肃清一切反革命分子的斗争正在展开，这个斗争，我们必须继续下去，坚持下去，一直到取得全部胜利。我们必须肃清一切反革命分子，而且也能够肃清一切反革命分子。
    我们说：我们能够肃清一切反革命分子，我们能够取得肃清反革命分子的斗争的全部胜利，是因为：我们的事业是正义的，是代表广大人民的利益因而也就必然会取得广大人民的支持的，人民革命的力量是人类进步的新生的伟大的力量；而反革命分子则是反动的，没落的，他们是帝国主义的走狗，是全国人民的公敌。他们只是极少数，在人民群众中处于极端孤立的地位。已经站立起来了的伟大的中国人民，是完全有力量可以战胜和肃清一切反革命分子的。历史规律说明了：一切反动阶级和反革命分子都是要灭亡的，这是他们注定了的必然的命运。
    我们说：我们能够取得肃清反革命分子的斗争的全部胜利，也因为我们还具备着以下这些必胜的条件。
    这些必胜条件是什么呢？
    首先，我们有肃清一切反革命分子的充裕的时间。任何反革命分子想逃脱过去，隐瞒下去，都是不可能的。随着我国社会主义革命事业的不断发展，广大人民群众的政治觉悟和革命警惕性的不断提高，任何反革命分子企图逃过人民的天罗地网，是办不到的。他们即使今天不被发现，明天也会被发现，今年不被发现，明年也会被发现。这次镇压反革命的群众运动开展以后，各地都破获了一些过去长期不能破获的反革命案件，甚至连那些改名换姓、化影变形、东逃西窜、假报死亡和躲藏在夹墙地道、深山野洞里的最狡猾的反革命分子，也被发现捕获了。那些用两面派手法混藏在我们内部的比较隐蔽的反革命分子，例如混在革命阵营里二十多年的胡风，隐藏在我们党内许多年的潘汉年、杨帆，也还不是一样被揭露出来了吗？
    其次，我们有肃清反革命分子的充分的材料。有的反革命分子，往往以为他的罪恶活动，别人不知道，以为我们手上没有掌握他的材料，因而进行顽抗抵赖。可是，他忘记了：人民群众会起来检举他；反革命组织里有些不愿意继续作反革命的人也会供出他；尤其是全国解放已经六年，我们不仅掌握了许多反革命分子过去和现在进行活动的材料，而且我们还可以进行充分的细致的调查研究工作。因此，任何反革命分子企图进行顽抗抵赖，都是无济于事的。我想，凡是参加了这次肃清反革命分子的斗争的同志们，差不多都亲自看到了有一些反革命分子在斗争初期，进行各种狡辩，企图转移视线；以后，就进行各种无耻的抵赖抗拒，企图蒙混过关；最后，当我们把掌握的材料摆出来，反革命分子在确凿的证据面前，只得低头认罪。这样的事实，是很多的。
    再次，我们肃清一切反革命分子的斗争，除了前面说的有充裕的时间和充分的材料这两个重要条件以外，还有一个取得胜利的更重要的条件，就是我们有党中央和毛主席所制定的正确的方针和正确的政策。
    我们的方针是什么呢？就是我们过去所一再讲的，毛主席指示我们的：“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的方针，就是实行“依靠领导机关的正确指导与广大群众的高度觉悟相结合”的方针。我们的政策是什么呢？就是要继续贯彻“镇压与宽大相结合”的政策。
    我们这个镇压与宽大相结合的政策，具体地说，就是：坦白从宽，抗拒从严。坦白比不坦白好，对坏人检举比不检举好。坦白了的，应处死刑的可以免处死刑，应处重刑的可以减刑，立功的可以将功折罪，立大功的可以受奖。不坦白的，一定要依法严惩。按照这个政策办事，不仅使那些坚决与人民为敌、进行破坏活动的反革命分子，受到应得的惩办，而且给那些愿意坦白悔过的反革命分子，指出了一条光明的出路。
    我们共产党和人民政府，从来就是言行一致的，我们说到那里，就做到那里。我们对待反革命分子的镇压与宽大相结合的政策早已在全国各地普遍地贯彻实行，并且取得了显著的成效。
    南京市店员工会，有一个暗藏的反革命分子谢坤林，早在抗日战争初期，就曾经参加过蒋匪和汪伪军，干过许多反革命反人民的勾当，有相当大的罪恶和民愤。解放以后，他伪造历史，隐瞒罪恶，先后混入了南京市总工会手工业联合会和南京市店员工会。如果他彻底坦白了自己的罪恶，痛改前非，重新作人，是还可以获得宽大处理的。可是，这个反革命分子却一直隐瞒着，拒不交代，表面伪装积极，骗取领导信任，暗中却勾结特务分子进行各种破坏活动。当这次肃清反革命分子的斗争开始以后，大家揭露了他的反革命面目，于是他更加仇恨共产党，仇恨人民政府，仇恨人民群众，仇恨一切革命干部。今年八月五日下午，这个反革命分子乘大家都在午睡的时候，拿着两把刀，闯入中共南京市金融贸易委员会，连续将王福印、吴淑俭（女）、杜秀梅（女）、张汝德（女）四位党员干部砍伤，并将青年团员孙元恺的颈部血管砍断。王福印等同志和反革命分子谢坤林猛力搏斗，当场将谢犯捉住。由于这个反革命分子怙恶不悛，拒不坦白，并且竟敢行凶杀人，南京市中级人民法院遂根据抗拒从严的政策，在今年八月十一日依法将该犯判处了死刑，立即执行。
    这就是那些坚决与国家和人民为敌、抗拒到底的反革命分子所走的可耻的道路。
    但是，对于反革命分子来说，也还有另外一条与此相反的光明的道路。
    混入天津市前市政工程局园场工程队的一个反革命分子王惠民，在抗日战争时期，也曾经参加过伪军，还当过小队长，经常下乡抢粮，扰害群众。
  一九四二年秋天，曾杀害了我军一个工作人员，以后又强征民夫修筑岗楼，指使伪军把农民徐恩喜打伤致死。如果按王惠民这个反革命分子的历史罪恶来看，比前面说的那个反革命分子谢坤林的罪恶是还要严重的，因为王犯既有民愤，又有血债，论理应当处以极刑。但是，由于他自动地彻底地坦白交代了他的罪行，确实有悔过的表现，所以，天津市军事管制委员会军法处，根据坦白从宽的政策和国家的法律，在九月十二日，从轻判处该犯有期徒刑十年。
    这是说的有历史罪恶的反革命分子，那末，有现实罪行的反革命分子怎么样呢？
    有一个反革命分子邢忠烈，解放前参加过汉奸组织新民会情报小组，还参加过国民党的特务组织“锄奸小组”，收集过我党的工作情报，并依势欺压人民。解放后，他隐瞒了这些罪恶历史，混入天津市第二十五中学当职员，在学校里散布反动言论，并且还隐藏着枪枝、子弹。他的罪行也是很严重的。但是，这个反革命分子邢忠烈，在人民政府的政策的感召下，彻底地坦白交代了自己的罪行，自动交出了所隐藏的手枪两枝，子弹五百多粒，及一部分反动书刊。因此，政府不仅免去了这个反革命分子应受的刑事处分，而且还准许他仍然留在学校工作，以观后效。
    江苏有一个美蒋特务分子刘忠良，一九五二年夏天，在香港参加了蒋匪特务组织“保密局”当特务，一九五三年春天又参加了美帝国主义“远东情报局”当间谍，一九五四年八月还参加了蒋匪“中委会”特务组织，在香港进行了许多背叛祖国的罪恶活动，并于一九五四年十月初，被蒋匪特务机关派遣回来，携带了特务工作计划和密写药粉等，阴谋回到祖国来进行破坏活动。但是，这个特务分子回国后，由于看到祖国进步的情景，受到政府的教育，同时，他的父母和亲友们，也向他宣传政府的宽大政策，于是他有了悔改，便于一九五四年十月九日，由他父亲领着向当地公安机关投案自首，交出了他的特务罪证，受到了政府的宽大处理，判处管制三年，回家劳动生产，重新作人。
    类似的事情，还可以举出很多。
    从以上这些反革命分子所受到的处理来看，今天，在一切反革命分子的面前，明明白白地摆着两条道路：一条是企图抗拒的反革命分子所走的可耻的死路；一条是自动坦白交代问题的反革命分子所走的光明的生路。一切反革命分子只有自动坦白，彻底交代自己的问题，才是唯一的出路。
    从以上所讲的这些情况和事例来看，也进一步说明了，只要我们能够充分利用各项有利条件，能够认真执行党中央和毛主席所规定的镇压反革命的正确的方针和政策，我们就必然能够达到彻底、干净、全部地肃清一切反革命分子的目的。
    为了使我们每个青年在当前的肃清反革命分子的斗争中，以及在今后长期的保卫祖国社会主义建设的斗争中，发挥更大的作用，我还愿意提出以下几点希望：
    我们希望工业战线上的青年们，要模范地遵守劳动纪律，严格地执行各项制度和操作规程，努力学习技术，精通本行业务，不仅保证自己不发生事故，而且要帮助别人防止发生事故，当事故已经发生，还要积极协助领导追查一切可疑事故。要积极参加防奸保卫工作，防止和打击反革命分子针对着我们工业建设所进行的一切破坏活动。
    我们希望农业战线上的青年们，要积极地贯彻党和国家的发展农业合作化运动的政策，帮助领导纯洁和巩固合作社的组织，积极参加做好对反动的地主阶级分子的监督和管制反革命分子的工作，防止和打击反革命分子和反动地主、富农分子针对着我们农业生产合作化运动所进行的一切破坏活动。
    我们希望人民军队和人民警察中的青年们，站稳自己的岗位，握紧自己的武器，提高警惕，保卫祖国。不仅善于同公开的拿枪的敌人作英勇的斗争，而且要学会同隐蔽的敌人作勇敢机智的斗争。
    我们希望知识青年们，不仅要努力学习自然科学，而且要努力学习马克思列宁主义，努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，提高自己的政治觉悟，积极参加实际斗争，与工农群众紧密地结合起来，提高革命警惕性，学会同一切伪装的披着各式各样外衣的反革命分子作斗争。
    我们希望在国家机关、群众团体和其他各种工作岗位上的青年们，要克尽职守，提高警惕，克服麻痹，严密制度，加强保密，防止坏人混入，打击一切反革命分子和坏分子的阴谋破坏。
    亲爱的同志们！我们中国青年，向来就是热爱祖国，热爱劳动，热爱我国人民英勇斗争的光荣历史的。今天我们的祖国正在沿着社会主义的大道前进，我们中国青年更加热爱我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设。我们是一支年轻的力量，我们是建设社会主义和保卫社会主义的突击队。在我们面前，任何困难都可以克服，任何敌人都可以战胜。在今后保卫祖国社会主义建设的斗争中，我们将更好地发扬我们英勇奋斗艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，发扬我们的模范作用和带头作用，广泛深入地宣传党和政府镇压反革命分子的各项政策，带动与推进全国广大青年同全国人民一道，更坚决更勇敢地进行肃清一切反革命分子的斗争，一直到取得彻底消灭敌人的全部胜利。我们深深地相信：全国青年和全国人民一道，在中国共产党和我们的天才的英明的领袖毛主席的领导下，将像创造奇迹一样，把我们国家建设成为
  一个光辉灿烂的无限美好和幸福的社会主义国家。
