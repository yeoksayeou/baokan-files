    Concerning the Resolution on Convening the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League and Suggesting Changing the Name of the China New Democratic Youth League to the Communist Youth League of China
    --Adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
                     September 18, 1955
    1. Since the Second National Congress of the Youth League in June 1953, the national Youth League organizations, following the direction of "good health, good study, good work" instructed by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have mobilized all members and united the vast number of young people to actively participate in the practical struggles of the great socialist construction and socialist transformation. The political enthusiasm of the youth across the country has reached a new high, and the League's organization has been further consolidated and strengthened. The vast number of young people have increasingly demonstrated that they are a heroic shock force in building and defending the motherland. In order to further strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the League and more effectively organize the youth of the country to strive for the realization of various tasks of socialist construction, the Third Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Youth League decided to convene the Third National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League in Beijing in the second half of 1956.

    2. In view of the fact that the period of the New Democratic Revolution in our country has ended, and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, have entered a new period of the great socialist revolution, the general tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation formulated by the Party and the state have put forward new tasks and new requirements for the Youth League. The broad masses of League members and young people, due to the continuous improvement of their socialist consciousness, also very much hope to change the name of the League. For this reason, the Third Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Youth League suggests that the "China New Democratic Youth League" be changed to the "Communist Youth League of China" at the Third National Congress; and instructs the Standing Committee to organize a special committee to be responsible for the revision of the League Constitution. The revised draft of the League Constitution must be published in the first half of 1956, and after extensive discussion by the whole League, it will be submitted to the Third National Congress for discussion and adoption.

    3. The agenda of the Third National Congress of the Youth League is: (1) To listen to and discuss the work report of the Second Central Committee of the Youth League; (2) To discuss and adopt the new League Constitution; (3) To elect the Central Committee.

    关于召开青年团第三次全国代表大会和建议更改中国新民主主义青年团的名称为中国共产主义青年团的决议
    ——中国新民主主义青年团第二届中央委员会第三次全体会议通过
                     一九五五年九月十八日
    一、自从一九五三年六月青年团第二次全国代表大会以来，全国青年团的组织遵循着中国共产党和毛主席指示的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的方向，动员全体团员和团结广大青年积极地参加了伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的各项实际斗争。全国青年的政治积极性有了新的高涨，团的组织也得到进一步的巩固和壮大，广大青年日益表现出是建设和保卫祖国的一支英勇的突击力量。为着进一步加强团的思想建设和组织建设，更有效地组织全国青年为实现社会主义建设的各项任务而奋斗，青年团第二届中央委员会第三次全体会议决定于一九五六年下半年在北京召开中国新民主主义青年团第三次全国代表大会。
    二、鉴于我们国家的新民主主义革命时期已经 终结，全国人民在党的领导下已进入了伟大的社会主义革命的新时期，党和国家所制定的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的总任务，已经给青年团提出了新的任务和新的要求，因而中国新民主主义青年团这一名称已不能确切地体现青年团组织的性质和任务。广大团员和青年由于社会主义觉悟的不断提高，也十分希望更改团的名称。为此，青年团第二 届中央委员会第三次全体会议建议在第三次全国代表大会上将“中国新民主主义青年团”改为“中国共产主义青年团”；并责成常委会组织专门委员会负责修改团章的工作。修改后的团章草案必须于一九五六年上半年公布，经过全团的广泛讨论之后，提交第三次全国代表大会讨论通过。
    三、青年团第三次全国代表大会的议程是：（一）听取和讨论青年团第二届中央委员会的工作报告；（二）讨论并通过新的团章；（三）选举中央委员会。
