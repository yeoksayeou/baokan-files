Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The 87th Annual Conference of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) opened in Southport on the 5th. There were 981 delegates from 183 unions attending this year's conference, representing a total of more than 8,106,000 members.

The agenda of the annual conference included 82 proposals submitted by various unions on foreign and domestic policies, international solidarity among working people, and welfare issues. A proposal put forward by the National Union of Life Assurance Workers advocated holding talks among the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and Britain, believing that "world peace can only be achieved and consolidated when these countries coordinate with each other with peaceful intentions." The Iron Founders' Union put forward an amendment to this proposal, pointing out the achievements of the Geneva Four-Power Summit and suggesting expanding the scale of the talks to allow leaders of the People's Republic of China to participate in the talks "to discuss the situation in the Far East and reach agreement on measures to ease international tensions." This union believed that these measures should include measures to "recognize People's China and resolve the Taiwan issue."

At the meeting on the 5th, Geddes, chairman of the General Council of the British Trades Union Congress, delivered the opening speech. When he spoke about the international situation, he believed that the Geneva Four-Power Summit had achieved positive results. At the same time, Geddes called on everyone to be cautious about the atmosphere of goodwill created by the Geneva Conference and expressed concern about the spread of "communist ideas."

Geddes also spoke about Britain's growing economic difficulties and the strike movement. His attitude towards the strike movement was similar to that of the employers and the government, insisting that strikes were one of the reasons for the deterioration of the domestic economic situation.

After Geddes' speech, the conference began to discuss the General Council's summary report. In the report, the General Council expressed "serious concern" about the British government's economic policies. The report criticized the government for failing to put forward a definite plan to increase industrial investment, lower prices, and promote production. On the contrary, it allowed profits to increase and dividends to rise. When the report talked about the material conditions of the British working people and their struggle to win their rights, it exposed the General Council's attempt to control workers' right to strike. The report suggested revising the relevant articles of the British Trades Union Congress's constitution so that it could intervene in negotiations between workers and employers.

In the part of the report on the international situation, on the one hand, it pointed out that the easing of tensions between major powers gave people hope that "more difficult and pressing international problems can also be resolved through negotiations." On the other hand, the General Council advocated maintaining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and supported arming West Germany and the Paris Accords.

The General Council also supported the divisive policies of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" that harmed the workers' movement.

At the end of the morning session on the 5th, the conference announced that it had received a congratulatory telegram from the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union. This news was greeted with warm applause from the delegates.

At the meeting on the 6th, a sharp struggle unfolded over the issue of the right of trade unions to declare strikes.

The General Council requested to amend the constitution of the Trades Union Congress so that it would have the right to intervene in negotiations when it believed that the negotiations between workers and employers would lead to a strike. In other words, the General Council demanded the right to decide on strike issues instead of the trade unions.

Representatives of many trade unions opposed this request. Electrical Trades Union Chairman Foulkes said that the General Council's proposal took away the workers' powerful weapon in the struggle to win their rights. National Union of Railwaymen General Secretary Campbell said: The proposed amendment to the Trades Union Congress's constitution undermined the workers' position in their struggle with employers.

As a result of the vote, under the manipulation of a group formed by some large unions that consistently supported the General Council, 4,842,000 votes were in favor of the General Council's proposal, and 3,039,000 votes were against it.

Supported by a group composed of several large trade unions, a proposal aimed at opposing so-called "unofficial strikes," which was not welcomed by ordinary members, was passed. 5,332,000 votes were in favor of this proposal, and 2,804,000 votes were against it.

    英国职工大会第八十七届年会在南港举行
    许多提案反映出英人民对加强和平的愿望
    右翼工会领导操纵年会通过干涉工人罢工权利的决议
    据新华社讯　英国职工大会第八十七届年会五日在南港开幕。参加这一届年会的有一百八十三个工会的九百八十一个代表，这些工会一共拥有八百一十万六千多会员。
    年会的议程上列着各工会提出的关于外交和内政政策、劳动人民的国际团结和福利问题的八十二个提案。全国人寿保险业工人联合会提出的提案主张美、苏、法、英四国举行会谈，认为“只有在这些国家彼此协调地怀着和平意图的情况下，才有可能达到并且巩固世界和平”。翻砂工人工会对这个提案提出了一个修正案，指出日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的成就，并且建议扩大会谈的规模，使中华人民共和国的领导人可以参加会谈，“以讨论远东的局势，并且就缓和国际紧张局势的措施达成协议”。这个工会认为，在这些措施中，应当包括“承认人民中国和解决台湾问题”的措施。
    在五日会议上，英国职工大会最高委员会主席吉迪斯致开幕词。他在讲到国际局势时，认为日内瓦四国政府首脑会议具有积极的成果。同时，吉迪斯却号召大家慎重地对待日内瓦会议所形成的善意气氛，并且对于“共产主义思想”的传布表示不安。
    吉迪斯还讲到英国日益增长的经济困难和罢工运动。他对罢工运动所采取的态度同企业主和政府的态度相近，硬说罢工是国内经济情况恶化的原因之一。
    在吉迪斯发言之后，大会开始讨论最高委员会的总结报告。最高委员会在报告中对英国政府的经济政策表示“严重不安”。报告指责政府没有提出增加工业投资的肯定的计划，来降低物价和促进生产。相反地，却听任利润增长和红利上升。报告谈到英国劳动人民的物质状况和他们为争取自己权利而进行的斗争时，暴露了最高委员会企图控制工人举行罢工的权利。报告建议修改英国职工大会章程的有关条款，以便使它有可能干预工人和企业主的谈判。
    报告在关于国际局势的一部分中，一方面指出，大国之间紧张关系的缓和使人满怀希望地觉得，“更困难的和迫切的国际问题也是可以通过谈判获得解决的”。另一方面，最高委员会却主张保持北大西洋集团，赞成武装西德和巴黎协定。
    最高委员会还赞成“国际自由工会联合会”执行的那种危害工人运动的分裂政策。
    五日上午会议结束时，大会宣布收到全苏工会中央理事会的贺电。这个消息博得了代表们亲切的掌声。
    在六日会议上，关于工会宣布罢工的权利的问题展开了尖锐的斗争。
    最高委员会要求修改职工大会的章程，以便在它认为工人和企业主的谈判势将酿成罢工时有权插手谈判。换句话说，最高委员会要求获得代替工会来决定罢工问题的权利。
    许多工会的代表都反对这种要求。电气工会主席福尔克斯说，最高委员会的建议夺去了工人们在争取自己权利的斗争中的强大武器。全国铁路工人工会总书记坎贝尔说：对职工大会章程提出的修改破坏了工人在他们同企业主斗争中的地位。
    表决结果，在一贯支持最高委员会的一些大工会结成的集团的操纵下，赞成最高委员会的建议的有四百八十四万两千票，反对的有三百零三万九千票。
    在几个大工会组成的集团支持下，通过了为普通会员所不欢迎的、目的在于反对所谓“非官方罢工”的提案。赞成这个提案的有五百三十三万二千票，反对的有二百八十万四千票。
