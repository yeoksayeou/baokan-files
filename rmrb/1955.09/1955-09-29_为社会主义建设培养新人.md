    Cultivating New People for Socialist Construction
    Xiang Nan
    Our people are solving a task of great historical significance, which is to build our country into an industrialized socialist nation with a high degree of modern culture. The Party has repeatedly taught us that the higher the people's level of awareness, the stronger their political training, the more consolidated their internal unity, and the faster the growth of new forces, the more effective the struggle for socialism will be.
    The socialist revolution is the most profound revolution, and its ultimate goal is to eliminate the exploiting classes. This revolution not only causes fundamental changes in the economic base, class relations, and political system of the entire society, but also causes fundamental changes in the ideology and moral concepts of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, this revolution is also the most complex and intense class struggle. All our fronts, all our departments, and all our work posts cannot stand outside the class struggle, and this struggle is manifested more sharply than ever among the youth. The resolution of the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out: "The unfolding of class contradictions... also means the unfolding of the struggle for the youth." Under the conditions of gradually transitioning to a socialist society, cultivating new people, that is, cultivating the youth to become infinitely loyal to the cause of the Party, possessing modern cultural and scientific knowledge, and being socialist active builders who are not afraid of any difficulties, is of particularly significant importance to the successful solution of the task of building socialism. Building socialism is inextricably linked with cultivating new people. To build socialism, it is necessary to mobilize all the youth and give full play to their enthusiasm, to continuously replenish new blood from the younger generation, to obtain a reserve labor force that meets the requirements of modern production, and to cultivate outstanding cadres in various departments of the country's economic and cultural construction. And the youth can only obtain genuine communist education in labor and in the nationwide struggle for building socialism, and can only temper themselves into an active and conscious force for building socialism.
    Under the leadership of the Party, China's youth have experienced a glorious and militant path, and today they are actively participating in all the most important socio-political events on the road to socialism. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong gave extremely high evaluations of the role of Chinese youth in the revolutionary struggle, praising them for having "played a certain vanguard role" in history, "standing at the forefront of the revolutionary ranks," and being "an army on one front against imperialism and feudalism, and an important army." In the period of socialist revolution, the Party has given youth even greater missions. The Party pointed out: "The historical task of realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning from new democracy to socialism mainly relies on the young generation of new China to complete." This generation of youth in our country is a new generation nurtured in the new society and grown up under the guidance of the Party. They are full of enthusiasm and ideals for building socialism, and they are eager to use their heroic labor to establish merits for the motherland to answer the Party's expectations. Actively strengthening the communist education of youth is precisely to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of youth in the cause of building socialism, and to enable youth to better shoulder the mission of building and completing a socialist society.
    Attracting the broad masses of young people to actively participate in all activities of the country, work diligently and conscientiously, and work in a down-to-earth manner is the fundamental direction and most important method for us to educate young people in the spirit of communism. Lenin taught that the cultivation and education of young people should be combined with their active participation in social life and with their participation in national labor. Labor is the source of creating all the wealth of society, the source of enhancing national power, and also the source of improving the people's material and cultural life. A conscious and honest attitude towards labor is an important sign of measuring everyone's political awareness. Among the youth in our country, the idea of regarding labor as a glorious and heroic undertaking is being established more and more widely. Countless young activists have given play to their enthusiasm and creative talents in labor. The more than 1,500 activists who recently attended the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists are outstanding representatives of the youth in our country.
    But after all, it should be seen that it has only been a few years since the people and youth of our country were liberated from the hateful old society and old system, and in the old society, labor became a heavy burden of people's suffering, and they could not get enough to eat and wear all year round. It is impossible to completely eliminate the old views on labor left over from the old society all at once. It is also very natural that there are some backward elements among the youth who have old views on labor, evading work and choosing "easy jobs." Some of them admire the corrupt and degenerate life of the bourgeoisie who do not work for nothing, and regard the bourgeois way of life as the "happiness" and "ideal" they strive for. Some people are unwilling to participate in physical labor, thinking that "studying is to get rid of labor" and that "with knowledge, one can avoid labor." When they fail to get into school, they think that "the future is bleak." It can be seen that a conscious attitude towards labor cannot be formed spontaneously, and it is necessary to educate young people with communist views on labor so that they understand that in the new society, labor has a completely new meaning. As Stalin taught, "Socialism and labor are inseparable. ... Socialism is not about everyone being lazy and gluttonous, but about everyone working honestly, not working for others, not working for the rich and exploiters, but working for themselves and for society." Young people should be allowed to participate appropriately in family labor and various physical labors from an early age, let them learn to manage their own lives and actively participate in voluntary labor for the public good, develop labor habits, interests, and certain labor skills, and gradually form their correct views on labor in labor, and understand that labor is the first need of life, and more universally and firmly establish the concept of "labor is glorious and laziness is shameful" among young people.
    Socialist society is a society with a high degree of culture and science, so the struggle for socialism is inextricably linked with the struggle for mastering knowledge and science. Lenin said that a communist society can only be built on the basis of modern knowledge, and if you do not understand this knowledge, then communism will always be just a wish. Guiding young people to study hard and tirelessly and firmly master cultural and scientific knowledge is the most important task in cultivating new socialist people. Our country has given unprecedented care to the education of the new generation. Our country's constitution stipulates that "the state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people." Comrade Mao Zedong urged young people to "have good health, study well, and work well." There are more than 58.41 million young people and children studying in primary and junior middle schools in our country, and more than 1.4 million people studying in senior middle schools, secondary vocational schools, and universities. This number is many times higher than before liberation. However, because the vast number of workers and peasants in our country were deprived of the opportunity to receive education in the past, a large proportion of them have not yet gotten rid of illiteracy. Lenin said: "A communist society cannot be built in a country full of illiteracy." In order to adapt to the development of industrialization and agricultural collectivization, a literacy campaign should be earnestly launched to eliminate illiteracy among young workers and peasants as early as possible, and to widely create conditions for young people to study culture, read newspapers and periodicals, and carry out cultural activities in every factory and rural area.
    Of course, young people in our country cannot be satisfied with getting rid of illiteracy and obtaining general cultural knowledge, but should also become experts in their own fields and far surpass their predecessors in science. At the beginning of the implementation of the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union, Stalin called on revolutionary youth to make a mass advance to science and seize the scientific fortress in front of them. This instruction is of great practical significance to our socialist construction cause today. What lies before us is an extremely glorious and great task, but our science and technology are very backward. If we cannot cultivate a sufficient number of outstanding cadres who are both virtuous and talented to meet the needs of national construction, and raise the cultural level of the working people to a considerable level, it will be impossible to build a socialist society.
    Studying hard in labor and various practical struggles is the most important way for the broad masses of young people to acquire knowledge. The vast majority of our young people are not studying in schools but are working in practical work positions. For young people who are studying in schools, that is, preparing to work, of course, they should make full use of school conditions to cultivate them into outstanding cadres who are both virtuous and talented to meet the needs of national construction. However, for young people who have already participated in production and work, they should be organized to study unremittingly in practical struggles. Even those who have studied in school cannot think that graduation means the completion of their education. Because the school can only obtain basic knowledge, Stalin said: "The school is just a preparatory stage. The real training of cadres is to be obtained in active work, outside the school, in the struggle against difficulties, and in the process of overcoming difficulties." Xu Renwu, who attended the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists, originally only had a high elementary school education. After several years of hard study, he has improved to the level of a college student in mathematics, chemistry, and physics, and is able to read Russian originals. He has risen from the level of an ordinary worker to the level of an engineer and is now serving as a shift director of a workshop. We should use such examples to educate those young people who think that they cannot study unless they go to school.
    Marxism-Leninism is an invincible and powerful force, and it is the sharpest weapon for winning the victory of socialism and communism. Only by seriously studying and mastering Marxism-Leninism and inheriting the experience of all revolutionary struggles can the younger generation shoulder the great task of holding up the banner of communism to the final victory. Marxism-Leninism is a fighting science. The Marxist-Leninist education of young people should be closely integrated with the Party's policies and lines, with ideological criticism, and with the current practical struggles. In particular, the tendency to neglect politics, theory, and class struggle among some young people at present should be criticized. This tendency can only lead young people to break away from politics and class struggle, become paralyzed and careless, and completely disarm themselves in front of the enemy, which is a very dangerous tendency.
    Since carrying out the socialist revolution means the elimination of capitalism in urban and rural areas and the elimination of the exploitative system, it will inevitably lead to the intensification of the class struggle. Therefore, arming young people with the knowledge of class struggle and revolutionary vigilance and protecting young people from the poisoning of the bourgeoisie and all reactionary forces ideologically and politically is of particularly great significance at present. While the enemy is conspiring to overthrow the people's regime and attempting to realize a counter-revolutionary restoration, they are also making every effort to use the weaknesses of young people to carry out the work of "winning over" and "liaising" with young people. The enemy understands that young people are the shock force in building socialism and the successors to the Party's great cause; therefore, the enemy is making every effort to spread all kinds of bourgeois ideas among young people through vulgar entertainment venues, reactionary, absurd, and obscene publications, and various despicable means, attempting to turn young people into decadent, selfish, degenerate, reactionary, and hateful people who hate the Party and the people and hate socialism. And secret agents, hooligans, bandits, and counter-revolutionary double-dealers are everywhere looking for those young people who do not care about politics, are corrupt and degenerate, and are individualists. Some counter-revolutionaries in religious clothing are spreading lies among young people that "what God needs are defeated, weak, sad, unsuccessful, and broken people." This is the most conclusive evidence of the counter-revolutionaries' struggle for young people. Countless facts have proven that those who think that "the world is at peace" and are therefore careless and cover up the contradictions of the class struggle can only play a role in disintegrating the people and young people. This is political right-leaning and a serious mistake. We must raise the revolutionary vigilance of young people, strengthen combat readiness, and keep young people in a clear mind at all times so that they can rise up at any time to defend the socialist construction of the motherland. At the same time, it is also necessary to thoroughly eliminate all open and hidden counter-revolutionaries, severely crack down on social professional hooligans, resolutely ban vulgar entertainment venues, actively deal with reactionary, absurd, and obscene publications, and strengthen the cultivation of communist moral qualities among young people from all aspects to resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology. This is an indispensable measure to protect young people from the poisoning of reactionary forces politically and ideologically.
    To guide young people to love their jobs, participate in various kinds of labor with great joy, and overcome difficulties and create miracles in daily ordinary labor, it is necessary to adopt special education methods suitable for the characteristics of young people. The new generation is not only different from the older generation in age and physiology, but also has different living environments, conditions, and experiences. Therefore, the education of young people should be different from that of adults. Stalin pointed out that one of the major tasks of the Party during the dictatorship of the proletariat is to carry out the work of transforming the old generation and educating the new generation in the spirit of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism. Here, it is called transformation for the old generation and education for the new generation, which is a very important distinction. The so-called special education method refers to a method that can most effectively cultivate the communist moral qualities of young people and give full play to the enthusiasm and creative spirit of young people. Positive education and active guidance are our basic principles for guiding young people. We must fully use revolutionary leaders, hero models, and advanced examples to educate young people. The noble qualities of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary leaders, such as hard struggle and heroic fearlessness, are the glorious models for the youth of our country, and all advanced people in production, technical innovators, and activists in socialist construction, their heroism and courage in labor, and their moving model deeds are living examples for young people to move forward. In recent years, we have introduced hero models to the broad masses of young people through newspapers, books, radio, literary works, and various conferences. The glorious deeds and noble moral appearance of those hero models can arouse the admiration, love, and heartfelt praise of young people so much, and can give young people such a strong sense of emotion and education, which is clear evidence.
    Educating young people is not about just talking about grand principles, but should be done through concrete activities and practical actions to improve young people's awareness. Recently, some organizational forms advocated by youth league organizations in various places and supported by party organizations, such as youth shock brigades, youth advanced classes and groups, youth thrift teams, youth reclamation teams, voluntary labor, and grain picking movements, are effective educational methods. Vigorously commending young activists on various fronts, using effective organizational forms to promote the experience of advanced producers and innovators to all working people, is an important method to effectively improve labor productivity, promote the completion of various tasks in the first five-year plan, and cultivate young people to fight against all backward phenomena such as following old ways and avoiding difficulties.
    The Party often teaches us to cherish any small enthusiasm of young people, to give enthusiastic encouragement and support to new forces, and to oppose suppressing new forces with a noble-master attitude. This instruction of the Party is of great significance for cultivating new people and giving play to the labor enthusiasm of young people. Young people are full of creative desires and determination to break through the status quo, and the labor that young people yearn for is a creative labor that can express their initiative. This desire is really the most precious quality of young people. Our responsibility lies in carrying forward this innovative spirit of young people and cultivating young people into people who can create boldly and work independently. Of course, young people sometimes make mistakes, so it is completely appropriate to point out shortcomings to young people in a timely manner and avoid and make fewer mistakes. In this case, it is wrong to indulge young people, but it is not appropriate to give young people too many restrictions and too much blame, and to pick on shortcomings with simple methods and rude attitudes, making young people feel that they are useless. In the youth itself, if they are afraid of making mistakes before they have done the work, and are afraid of "showing their heads" and not being "mature" all day long, and cannot distinguish between personal ideals and individualism, and cannot distinguish between independent responsibility and making independence, then creativity and new forces cannot be developed and grown. We must never make young people cautious, timid, and cowardly, which is very harmful to the revolutionary cause. As long as young people are loyal to the Party and the people, it is not a bad thing to be bold in their work and have a little "youthfulness." Our Party is a Party that looks forward, and is a Party that supports new forces and new things and fights against all outdated and reactionary forces. What the Party hopes for is that each generation will be better than the previous generation, and that "students will surpass their teachers." The Party often points out that it is necessary to open up the way for young people, and that young people should be allowed to dare to act and live and work vigorously; young people should be encouraged to dare to break with old ideas, dare to challenge outdated things, and launch struggles against backward phenomena. Because only those who grow up in actual struggles are vigorous, tenacious, lively and optimistic, energetic, confident in their own strength, and not afraid of any difficulties.
    In exposing backward social consciousness and things that hinder social progress, in educating young people with communist moral qualities, and in fighting against feudal remnants and bourgeois ideas that discriminate against and destroy young people, women, and children, progressive social public opinion plays an extremely important role. Continuing to strengthen the propaganda of newspapers and periodicals in this regard will better mobilize all the people to care about the growth of the younger generation and give a positive influence to the formation of new qualities and appearance of young people.
    The work of cultivating and educating young people is a common cause of the whole Party and the whole society, but as the Party's assistant and reserve army, and as the core force to unite young people across the country, the Youth League has a particularly important responsibility. The Party has entrusted the glorious responsibility of uniting and educating the entire younger generation to the Youth League. The Youth League should, with an active and proactive spirit, expand the influence of the Youth League among young people through its regular ideological and organizational work, through various lively and concrete activities and the exemplary behavior of the Youth League members, and unite young people more closely around the Party, so that all its work is subordinate to the interests of building socialism.
    The general tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation formulated by the Party have revealed magnificent prospects to the people and youth of our country, encouraging young people to struggle to realize this great ideal. Young people are always the most active and enthusiastic fighters in the pursuit of light and socialism. When the people of the whole country are struggling to realize the first five-year plan, giving full play to the enthusiasm of young people in the struggle to build socialism, improving and raising the communist education of young people, and cultivating young people into active and conscious fighters for building socialism is an extremely important task for our Party and all the people to smoothly move towards a socialist society. We must actively and enthusiastically realize this task!

    为社会主义建设培养新人
    项南
    我国人民正在解决着具有伟大历史意义的任务，这个任务就是要把我国建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的社会主义国家。党一再教导我们，人民的觉悟程度越高，政治锻炼越强，内部的团结越巩固，新生力量成长的越快，争取社会主义的斗争就越有成效。
    社会主义革命是最深刻的革命，这个革命要达到消灭剥削阶级的最终目的。这个革命不仅引起整个社会的经济基础、阶级关系、政治制度的根本改变，而且会引起广大人民的思想意识、道德观念的根本改变。因而这个革命又是一场最复杂、最激烈的阶级斗争。我们的一切战线、一切部门和一切工作岗位都不可能置身于阶级斗争之外，这一斗争在青年中更表现得比任何时候都愈加尖锐。联共（布）第十四次代表大会决议中曾指出：“阶级矛盾的展开………也就意味着争取青年的斗争的展开。”在逐步过渡到社会主义社会的条件下，培养新人，即把青年培养成为无限忠实于党的事业，具有现代文化科学知识，不怕任何困难的社会主义积极建设者，对顺利解决建设社会主义的任务，具有特别重大的意义。建设社会主义是同培养新人不可分离地联系着的。要建设社会主义就必须把全体青年动员起来，并充分发挥青年的积极性，必须从年轻一代那里不断地补充新的血液，从那里得到合乎现代化生产要求的劳动后备力量，从那里培养出国家经济和文化建设各个部门的优秀干部。而青年也只有在劳动中，在为建设社会主义而展开的全民斗争中，才能获得真正的共产主义教育，才能把自己锻炼成建设社会主义的积极的、自觉的力量。
    我国青年在党的领导下，经历了光荣的、战斗的道路，今天正在积极参加向社会主义前进道路上的一切最重大的社会政治事件。对于我国青年在革命斗争中的作用，党和毛泽东同志给了极高的估价，称誉我国青年在历史上“起了某种先锋队的作用”，“站在革命队伍的前头”，“是反帝反封建的一个方面军，而且是一个重要的方面军”。而在社会主义革命时期，党又赋予青年以更重大的使命，党指出：“实现国家工业化和逐步地由新民主主义过渡到社会主义的这个历史任务，主要依靠新中国的年轻一代来完成”。我国这一代的青年，是在新社会的养育和在党的教导下成长起来的新生的一代，他们对建设社会主义充满着热情和理想，他们渴望着用自己的英勇劳动为祖国树立功勋，来回答党的期望。积极加强青年的共产主义教育，正是为了充分发挥青年在建设社会主义事业中的积极性和创造性，为了使青年更好地担当起建设和建成社会主义社会的使命。
    吸引广大青年积极参加国家的一切活动，勤勤恳恳、脚踏实地地劳动，是我们以共产主义精神教育青年的根本方向和最重要的方法。列宁教导说，培养和教育青年要跟青年们积极参加社会生活，跟他们参加全民劳动结合起来。劳动是创造社会一切财富的源泉，增强国家威力的源泉，也是改善人民的物质生活和文化生活的源泉。自觉和诚实的劳动态度，是测量每个人政治觉悟的重要标志。在我国青年中，把劳动看成是光荣、豪迈的事业的思想，正在愈来愈广泛地树立起来。无数青年积极分子在劳动中发挥了自己的积极性和创造才能。最近出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的一千五百多名的积极分子，就是我国青年的优秀代表。
    但毕竟还应当看到，我国人民和青年，从可憎恨的旧社会、旧制度解放出来还只是几年的功夫，而在旧社会里，劳动成为人们苦痛的重担，终年劳动而不得温饱。旧社会中遗留下来的对待劳动的旧观点是不可能一下子就肃清的。在青年中间，存在一些逃避工作，选择“轻松活儿”的旧的劳动观点的落后分子，也是很自然的。他们当中有些人羡慕资产阶级不劳而获的腐化堕落的生活，把资产阶级的生活方式当作自己争取的“幸福”和“理想”。有些人不愿参加体力劳动，认为“学习就是为了脱离劳动”，“有了知识才能避免劳动”，在升不了学时，就认为“前途暗淡了”。可见自觉的劳动态度，是不可能自发地形成的，必须以共产主义的劳动观点教育青年，使他们懂得在新社会中，劳动有了完全新的意义。正如斯大林所教导的那样，“社会主义和劳动是分不开的。……社会主义并不是要大家好吃懒做，而是要大家诚恳劳动，不是替别人去劳动，不是替富豪和剥削者去劳动，而是为自己，为社会而劳动。”应当让青年们从小就适当地参加家庭劳动和各种体力劳动，让他们学会管理自己的生活和为公共利益积极参加义务劳动，养成劳动的习惯、兴趣和一定的劳动技能，并在劳动中逐渐形成他们对待劳动的正确观点，懂得劳动是人生的第一需要，在青年中更普遍地更牢固地树立起“劳动光荣、偷懒可耻”的观念。
    社会主义社会是具有高度文化和科学的社会，所以，为社会主义而斗争是同为掌握知识、掌握科学而斗争不可分地联系着的。列宁说过，只有在现代知识基础上，才能建立起共产主义社会，如果不通晓这种知识，那共产主义始终不过是一种愿望而已。引导青年顽强不倦地学习，牢固地掌握文化科学知识，是培养社会主义新人最重要的任务。我们国家对于新一代的教育，给了从未有过的关怀。我国宪法上规定“国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展”。毛泽东同志更谆谆地嘱咐青年要做到“身体好，学习好，工作好”。我国青少年在小学和初级中学读书的有五千八百四十一万多人，在高级中学、中等专业学校和高等学校学习的有一百四十多万人。这个数字比之解放前已经超过了许多倍。但由于我国广大工农青年，在过去被剥夺了受教育的机会，所以至今还有很大部分没有摆脱文盲状态，列宁说：“在一个文盲充斥的国家内，是建成不了共产主义社会的。”为了适应工业化和农业合作化的发展，应当认真展开扫盲运动，提早扫除工农青年中的文盲，并广泛地在每个工厂和农村给青年创造学习文化、阅读书报和开展文化活动的条件。
    我国青年当然不能以脱离文盲、获得一般的文化知识为满足，还应当成为精通本行的专家，并在科学上远远超过自己的前辈。斯大林在苏联实行第一个五年计划的开头，曾经号召革命青年向科学作群众性的进军，夺下自己面前的科学堡垒。这个指示对我们今天建设社会主义事业说来，特别具有伟大的现实意义。摆在我们面前的是极其光荣伟大的任务，但我们的科学技术却十分落后，如果我们不能培养出足够数量的合乎国家建设需要的德才兼备的优秀干部，并把劳动人民的文化程度提高到相当的水平，要想建成社会主义社会是不可能的。
    在劳动中、各种实际斗争中顽强地学习，是广大青年取得知识的最重要的途径。我们青年中的绝大部分并不是在学校中而是在实际工作岗位上劳动着的。对于正在学校中学习也就是准备劳动的青年，当然要充分利用学校条件，培养他们成为合乎国家建设需要的德才兼备的优秀干部，但对已经参加生产和工作的青年来说，就应当组织他们在实际斗争中永不松懈地学习。即使在学校学习过的人，也不能认为毕业就完成了自己的教育。因为学校只能获得基础知识，斯大林说过：“学校还只是一个预备阶段。干部底真正锻炼，是要在活的工作中，在学校以外，在和困难作斗争中，在克服困难的过程中取得的。”出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的徐人武原来只有高小文化程度，经过几年的刻苦学习，已经在数学、化学和物理学方面，提高到相当大学生的程度，并且能够阅读俄文原著了。他已从一个普通工人的水平提高到相当于工程师的水平，现在担任着一个车间的轮班主任。我们应当用这样的事例去教育那些认为非进学校就不能学习的青年。
    马克思列宁主义是所向无敌的强大力量，是争取社会主义和共产主义胜利实现的最锋利的武器。年轻一代只有认真学习和掌握马克思列宁主义，继承全部革命斗争的经验，才能担负起把共产主义的旗帜撑持到最终胜利的伟大任务。马克思列宁主义是战斗的科学。对青年进行马克思列宁主义的教育，应当紧密地同党的政策、路线相结合，同思想批判相结合，同当前实际斗争相结合。特别应当批判目前在一部分青年中忽视政治、忽视理论、忽视阶级斗争的倾向。这种倾向只能导致青年脱离政治、脱离阶级斗争，麻痹大意，在敌人面前完全解除武装，这是一种十分危险的倾向。
    进行社会主义革命既然意味着城乡资本主义的消灭、剥削制度的消灭，就必然引起阶级斗争的尖锐化。因此，以阶级斗争知识和革命警惕性武装青年，从思想上、政治上保护青年不受资产阶级和一切反动势力的毒害，在当前就具有特别重大的意义。敌人在阴谋推翻人民政权、企图实现反革命复辟的同时，也竭力在利用青年人的弱点，进行“争取”、“联络”青年的工作。敌人懂得青年是建设社会主义的突击力量，是党的伟大事业的继承人；因此，敌人就通过下流娱乐场所，通过反动、荒诞、淫秽的书刊，通过各种卑鄙手段，竭力在青年中散布各色各样的资产阶级思想，企图把青年变成颓废、自私、堕落、反动、仇恨党和人民、仇恨社会主义的人。而特务、流氓、盗匪和反革命两面派，更到处在物色青年中那些不问政治、腐化堕落分子和个人主义者。一些披着宗教外衣的反革命分子在青年中散布什么“神所需要的是失败的、软弱的、悲伤的、不成功的、破碎的人”的谎言。就是暴露反革命分子争夺青年的最确凿的罪证。无数事实证明了：那些认为“天下太平”，因而粗心大意，把阶级斗争的矛盾掩盖起来的做法，只能起瓦解人民和青年的作用。这是政治上的右倾，是严重的错误。我们必须提高青年的革命警惕性，加强战斗准备，使青年经常保持清醒的头脑，以便随时起来保卫祖国的社会主义建设。同时，还要彻底肃清一切公开和暗藏的反革命分子，严厉打击社会职业流氓，坚决取缔下流娱乐场所，积极处理反动、荒诞、淫秽的书刊，并从各方面加强青年共产主义道德品质的培养，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，这是从政治上、思想上保护青年不受反动势力毒害的必不可少的措施。
    要引导青年热爱自己的工作岗位，兴高采烈地参加各种各样的劳动，并在日常的平凡劳动中克服困难，创造奇迹，就必须采用适合青年特点的特殊的教育方法。新的一代同老一辈不仅有年龄、生理上的不同，而且生活环境、条件和经历也都是不相同的。因此对待青年人的教育就要和成年人区别开来。斯大林指出，党在无产阶级专政时期的重大任务之一，就是开展以无产阶级专政和社会主义精神改造老一代和教育新一代的工作。这里对老一代叫改造，对新一代叫教育，就是极重要的区别。所谓特殊的教育方法，是指的这样一种方法，要能够最有成效地培养青年的共产主义道德品质，最充分地发挥青年的积极性和创造精神。正面教育，积极引导，是我们指导青年的基本原则。我们必须充分用革命领袖、英雄模范人物和运用先进事例去教育青年。革命先烈和革命领袖那种艰苦奋斗、英勇无畏的高贵品质，是我国青年的光辉典范，而一切生产上的先进人物，技术革新者，社会主义建设积极分子，他们在劳动中所表现的英勇和果敢，他们动人的模范事迹，则是青年们前进的活的榜样。几年来，我们通过报刊、书籍、广播、文学作品和各种会议等形式，向广大青年介绍了英雄模范人物。那些英雄模范人物的光辉事迹和崇高的道德面貌，能够那样地引起青年们的崇敬、热爱和衷心的赞扬，能够那样地给青年们以强烈的感动和教育，就是明证。
    对青年进行教育，不是靠光讲大道理，应当通过具体活动，通过实际行动，去提高青年的觉悟。近来由各地青年团组织倡导，得到党的组织所支持的一些组织形式，如青年突击队，青年先进班、组，青年节约队，青年垦荒队，义务劳动，拣粮运动等，就是有效的教育方式。大力表彰各个战线上的青年积极分子，运用有效的组织形式，把先进生产者和革新者的经验推广到一切劳动群众中去，是有效地提高劳动生产率、推动第一个五年计划各项任务的完成和培养青年向一切因循守旧、回避困难等的落后现象作斗争的重要方法。
    党经常教导我们，要爱护青年人任何一点微小的积极性，要对新生的力量给以热情的鼓励和支持，反对用贵族老爷式的态度去压制新生力量。党的这个指示，对于培养新人、发挥青年的劳动积极性有着极重大的意义。青年充满创造的欲望和突破现状的决心，青年所向往的劳动，乃是一种创造性的、能够表现自己主动精神的劳动。这种愿望实在是青年最可宝贵的品质。我们的责任，就在于发扬青年的这种革新精神，把青年培养成能够大胆创造，独立工作的人。当然，青年有时也会产生过失，因而向青年及时指出缺点、避免和少犯错误是完全应当的。在这种情况下，对青年放纵是错误的，但不宜给青年过多的限制和过多的指责，动辄用简单的方法和粗暴的态度去挑剔缺点，使青年人感到一无是处。在青年本身，如果还没有做工作就先怕犯错误，成天怕“露头”、怕不“老成”，分不清什么是个人理想和什么是个人主义、分不清什么是独立负责和什么是闹独立性，那末创造性也好、新生力量也好，是发展不起来、生长不起来的。我们决不要使青年成为谨小慎微、胆怯懦弱的人，这对革命事业是非常有害的。只要青年对党对人民是忠诚的，在工作上泼辣一点，“青年气”一点并没有什么坏处。我们的党是向前看的党，是支持新生力量和新鲜事物而和一切陈旧、反动力量作斗争的党。党所希望的，是一代胜过一代，“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。党经常指出要为青年开路，应当让青年敢作敢为，生龙活虎地工作和生活；应当鼓励青年敢于和旧的思想决裂，勇于向陈旧的事物挑战，向落后现象展开斗争。因为只有在实际斗争中成长起来的人，才是朝气蓬勃，坚忍不拔，活泼乐观，精力充沛，确信自己的力量，不怕任何困难的人。
    在揭露落后的社会意识和阻碍社会前进的事物上，在以共产主义道德品质教育青年上，在同歧视、摧残青年、妇女、儿童的封建残余思想和资产阶级思想作斗争中，进步的社会舆论，都起着极其巨大的作用。继续加强报刊对这方面的宣传，将能更好地动员全体人民都来关怀青年一代的成长，给予青年新的品质面貌的形成以积极影响。
    培养教育青年的工作是全党全社会的共同事业，但作为党的助手和后备军，作为团结全国青年的核心力量的青年团，却负有特殊重大的责任。党把团结教育整个年轻一代的光荣责任交给青年团，青年团应当以积极主动精神，通过自己经常的思想教育工作和组织工作，通过各种生动具体的活动和团员的模范行为，扩大青年团在青年中的影响，把青年更紧密地团结到党的周围，使自己的全部工作都服从于建设社会主义的利益。
    党所制定的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的总任务，给我国人民和青年揭示了壮丽的远景，鼓舞着青年们为实现这一伟大理想而斗争。青年永远是追求光明，追求社会主义最积极、最热情的战士。当全国人民为实现第一个五年计划而斗争的时候，充分发挥青年在建设社会主义斗争中的积极性，改进和提高对青年的共产主义教育，把青年培养成为建设社会主义积极的、自觉的战士，是我们党和全体人民顺利走向社会主义社会途中的极其重要的任务。我们一定要积极热情地来实现这项任务！
