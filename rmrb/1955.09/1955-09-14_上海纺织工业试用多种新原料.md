    The Shanghai branch of the China Silk Company recently purchased 50 metric tons of eri silkworm cocoons from Anhui Province, preparing to experiment with weaving new products in Shanghai.
    This eri silkworm was transplanted from India. Not long ago, the state-owned Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory used eri silk to trial-produce light and pure white silk fabrics. The state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Wool Textile Factory also blended it with wool to weave single-sided tweed and feather yarn tweed, with exquisite quality. Staff at the Shanghai branch of the China Silk Company believe this is a new silk raw material with great potential for development. In addition to Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces and regions have also begun cultivating this eri silkworm this year.
    There are several other new textile raw materials being used for trial production and production of textiles in Shanghai. Ramie, which grows in many areas of China, is now being tested for blending with cotton. The state-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory has trial-produced more than 7,000 bolts of ramie yarn and poplin, which have been successively processed into printed fabrics and sold on the market. Starting in September, this factory will continue to trial-produce ramie-cotton blended khaki. The East China Textile Administration is also preparing to experiment with blending ramie and wool.
    After testing by Shanghai textile factories, wild Apocynum venetum from the Northwest has proven to be a high-grade textile raw material. The Shanghai branch of the China National Native Produce Export Corporation is processing a portion of refined Apocynum venetum in Shanghai, preparing it for export.
    In wool spinning mills, the trial production of blended yarn and various woolen clothing fabrics using artificial wool and wool has also been successful. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海纺织工业试用多种新原料
    中国丝绸公司上海市公司最近从安徽省收购了五十公担蓖麻蚕茧，准备在上海试验纺织新的产品。
    这种蓖麻蚕是从印度移殖过来的，不久前国营上海绢纺织厂已用蓖麻蚕丝试制成轻盈洁白的绢纺；国营上海第三毛纺织厂也用它和羊毛混纺织成单面花呢和羽纱花呢，质地也很精美。中国丝绸公司上海市公司的工作人员认为这是一种很有发展前途的新的丝绸原料。除安徽外，今年福建、河南、云南、贵州等省区都开始培育这种蓖麻蚕。
    在上海用来试制和生产纺织品的新的纺织原料，还有好几种。在我国许多地区生长的苎麻，现在正试用与棉花混纺。国营上海第九棉纺织厂试用混纺的七千多匹麻纱和府绸已陆续加工成花色布在市场上出售。九月份起，这个厂又继续试制麻棉混纺的卡其。华东纺织管理局还准备试用苎麻与羊毛混纺。
    西北野生的罗布麻经上海纺织工厂试验后，证明可以做高级纺织原料。中国土产出口公司上海分公司正在上海加工一部分精炼过的罗布麻，准备出口。
    在毛纺厂里，用人造毛与羊毛混纺制绒线和多种呢绒衣料，也已试验成功。　（新华社）
