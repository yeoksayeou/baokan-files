Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 7th: The Japan Peace Committee held a meeting of its secretariat on August 29th. The meeting decided to support the struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town against the expansion of the U.S. Tachikawa base; and expressed support for the Indian people's struggle to liberate Goa, lodging a serious protest against the atrocities of the Portuguese authorities.

According to the decision of the meeting, the strength of the people of all strata will be widely mobilized to strive for the victory of Sunagawa Town's struggle against the expansion of the base. In order to achieve this goal, the meeting decided to ask all peace organizations and mass organizations to once again exert the power of unity around the World Conference for the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to support the residents of Sunagawa Town; and called on people of all strata to donate money to support the residents of Sunagawa Town and sign petitions against the expansion of the Tachikawa base.

The meeting also decided to: demand that the National Liaison Conference Against Military Bases hold a national representative conference against bases in Sunagawa Town, exchange experiences in anti-base struggles in various places, and expose the government's various deceptive conspiracies; explain to the people the nature of the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement" as violating the interests of the people. And combine the movement to ban atomic weapons with the struggle against military bases.

In addition, the meeting decided to call on the people and arouse public opinion against the United States transporting atomic rocket launchers and bombers capable of carrying atomic bombs to Japan. The meeting believes that transporting these weapons to Japan to forcibly prepare for atomic war is contrary to the people's desire for peace and efforts, and also violates the promises of the Hatoyama Cabinet. This measure will exacerbate tensions in Asia and undermine world peace.

    日本拥护和平委员会号召支援砂川町居民
    团结一致进行禁止原子武器运动和反对军事基地斗争
    新华社七日讯东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会曾在八月二十九日举行书记局会议。会议决定支援砂川町居民反对扩大美国立川基地的斗争；并且表示支持印度人民解放果阿的斗争，对葡萄牙当局的暴行提出严重抗议。
    根据会议的决定，将广泛动员各阶层人民的力量，争取砂川町反对扩大基地斗争的胜利。为了实现这个目的，会议决定要求各和平组织和群众团体再一次发挥团结在禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会周围的力量，支援砂川町居民；并且号召各阶层人民捐款支援砂川町居民和签名反对扩大立川基地。
    会议还决定：要求全国反对军事基地联络会议在砂川町举行全国反对基地代表会议，交流各地反对基地斗争的经验，揭露政府的各种欺骗阴谋；向人民说明美日“行政协定”的违反人民利益的性质。并且使禁止原子武器运动和反对军事基地斗争结合起来。
    另外，会议决定要号召人民和唤起舆论反对美国把原子火箭发射器和能够装载原子弹的轰炸机运到日本。会议认为把这些武器运到日本强行准备原子战争，是违背人民要求和平的意愿和努力的，也是违反鸠山内阁的诺言的。这种措施将加剧亚洲紧张局势和破坏世界和平。
