Agricultural Cooperativization Changes the Face of the Fuan Area
	Zeng Yuqiu

In the Fuan Special District of Fujian Province on the east coast, natural conditions are very complex. More than 70% of the land is mountainous. Most of the cultivated land consists of layered terraces. Only a few areas are small plains between mountains. Natural disasters are frequent: floods in spring, droughts in summer, typhoons in summer and autumn, and insect plagues at any time. People along the coast also have to fight against sea tides, while people in the mountains suffer from animal pests. The people in the mountains are hardworking and brave, but they have never found a path to prosperity.

In the spring of 1953, the Communist Party organization in the Fuan area led farmers in a trial run of 14 agricultural production cooperatives, most of which increased production. Although three cooperatives suffered severe drought, they reduced production less than farmers outside the cooperatives. Since then, the people of the Fuan Special District have begun to see a happy future. In 1954, the number of cooperatives increased to 110, and in the autumn, most of the cooperatives again increased production compared to farmers outside the cooperatives. In Huanggen Township, Zherong County, four cooperatives increased their average yield per mu by 22%, nine permanent mutual aid teams increased their average yield per mu by 16%, and five temporary mutual aid teams increased their average yield per mu by 12%. The fact that agricultural cooperatives had high yields attracted more farmers to embark on the road of cooperativization. From the autumn of 1954 to July 1955, there were already 1,666 cooperatives in the entire district. There were 41,315 cooperative member households. Among the 773 townships in the district, 562 had agricultural cooperatives. This year, the spring harvest crops of agricultural cooperatives have also been unprecedentedly abundant. The development of cooperativization is changing the face of the land and people's thinking.

Wheat Grows for the First Time
	
Dongshan Township in Zhouning County is a mountain township surrounded by many hillsides. This township never grew wheat; but this year, golden wheat grew for the first time on the land of the township's agricultural cooperative. The cooperative members ground the wheat into flour for the Dragon Boat Festival. When they saw the pearl-like wheat grains, they couldn't help but admire them. Cooperative member Chen Qipu said: "Chairman Mao has come up with a good method for us. By setting up cooperatives, yellow soil turns into gold. Mountainous garden land where nothing used to grow can now grow wheat." This mountainous area suffered severe damage before liberation. There was a shortage of labor, and the land was cultivated very crudely. Many fields and gardens were abandoned. The elderly said: "This place is barren and the people are poor, and nothing good can be grown." Farmers were afraid of not having enough fertilizer, so they didn't even grow crops in the rice paddies. They planted one crop of rice in the paddy fields in the year and one crop of sweet potatoes in the dry land in the year, and left it idle in the winter. Last winter, the people's government called on farmers to plant another crop. The agricultural cooperative held a special meeting on this matter and planned to use 50 mu of idle mountain garden land in the winter to plant wheat. The main difficulty in planting wheat was the lack of fertilizer. To plant 50 mu of land, 500 dan of fertilizer would be needed. To accumulate some mountain ash and grass ash in the mountains, one had to run two or three li. After the autumn harvest, sweet potatoes had to be harvested and dried. If winter planting was to be carried out, fertilizer had to be accumulated, and these tasks had to be done on sunny days, so there was a labor shortage. Individual farm households could not overcome this difficulty. However, agricultural cooperatives can rationally use labor, and the difficulty is easily overcome. They left some people to harvest sweet potatoes, extracted some people to plant wheat, and extracted some people to accumulate fertilizer. Several agricultural tasks were carried out simultaneously, and finally 50 mu of wheat were planted. As a result, the average yield per mu was 84 jin, which was almost equal to half a season of rice.

Due to the lead taken by the agricultural cooperative in winter planting, coupled with the large-scale development of agricultural cooperatives, the winter planting area in the counties of the Fuan Special District generally increased last winter and this spring. The entire district harvested a bumper crop of spring food crops such as barley, wheat, broad beans, peas, and potatoes, totaling 35 million jin, an increase of more than 11 million jin over last year, accounting for 94% of the district's annual food production increase target. Rape also increased by more than 19,000 dan, an increase of more than 84% over last year. The achievements of agricultural cooperatives are the most prominent. In the twelfth district of Fuan County, the winter wheat sowing area in the entire district expanded by 32.8%, while the agricultural cooperative expanded by 227.8%; the rape area in the entire district expanded by 66%, while the agricultural cooperative expanded by 376.2%; the barley area in the entire district expanded by 11%, while the agricultural cooperative expanded by 450%; the pea area in the entire district expanded by 90%, while the agricultural cooperative expanded by 264.4%. Because agricultural cooperatives have good field management of spring harvest crops, the yield per unit area is also higher than that of ordinary farmers.

Mountain Village Rice Enters Granary in July

Louxia Township in Fuan County is a mountain village where only single-season rice has always been grown. Two years ago, I heard that a farm tried to grow double-cropping rice, and many people did not believe it. Last spring, the Liu Naiyou mutual aid team wanted to try to plant a little. To plant, the soil quality must first be improved. They wanted to improve Wang Ruixi's one-and-three-tenths mu of land. After calculation: excluding meals, the labor cost alone would be 4.8 yuan, and everyone's hearts were cold. Team member Liu Lichun said: "So much cash is needed, but who knows what the harvest will be?" Some said: "What if the land is not suitable and there is no harvest?" Therefore, they stopped.

Last autumn, this mutual aid team transformed into the Minjin Agricultural Cooperative, and there were more methods. The cooperative planned to improve the soil of 27 mu of land and plant double-cropping rice. During the Spring Festival, the cooperative mobilized dozens of people every day to carry more than 1,300 dan of fertile soil and more than 20 dan of green manure to the 27 mu of land, and planted double-cropping rice. More fertilizer was applied, and insects and weeds were diligently removed. The entire cooperative harvested a total of 144 dan of the first season of early rice, with an average yield of 525 jin per mu. This was about 100 jin more per mu than planting single-season rice last year. The cooperative members happily said: "The first season has already yielded so much. Adding the second season, each mu will yield 900 jin or 1,000 jin." The good news spread throughout the village, and farmers outside the cooperative also said: "People say that Taiwan rice is double-cropped, and Fuzhou rice enters the granary in June (lunar calendar), because that land is treasure land. I didn't expect our mountain gully to have a miracle this year. Agricultural cooperatives are really capable."

This year, the early rice area in the entire special district has been expanded by several thousand mu, and the agricultural cooperatives have expanded the most. For example, Shouning and Zherong counties have never grown early rice, but they did this year. Shouning County planted 252 mu in the entire county, and the agricultural cooperatives planted 229 mu. Zherong County planted 127 mu in the entire county, and the agricultural cooperatives planted 95 mu. New things like this, changing from single-season to double-season, are constantly appearing in the mountains.

From Grain Shortage to Grain Surplus

Shouning County is located in a high mountain area. The local farmers use these words to describe the height of the local mountains: "Cheling goes up to the sky, nine ridges pass in nine years." And the land is fragmented. Farmers say: "A handful of rice seedlings is planted in three plots," "The embankment (referring to the field wall) is as high as a mountain, and the field is as small as a dipper." The difficulty of cultivation can be imagined. In this area, land is rarely fertilized and is eroded by rainwater, becoming barren day by day. Farmers cannot completely rely on the land and must go out to engage in some side occupations to make a living. Several mountainous counties such as Zhouning County have similar situations to Shouning. In Limen Township, Zhouning County, "Every year, as soon as the first month is over, the men go out to make palm clothes and work as mud workers; they return home in April (lunar calendar), plow and harrow the soil once, put the rice seedlings in the fields, weed once at the end of June, and then go out again, returning late at the end of the year. Farming like this yields an average of just over 200 jin per mu; the grain produced is not enough to eat year after year." In the winter of 1953, the He Dexiang mutual aid team in Chiyuan Village of this township, consisting of 15 households, lacked a total of 10 dan of grain. In March 1954, 11 households in this team formed the Chiyuan Agricultural Cooperative, and the situation changed. They extracted some people to engage in side occupations outside, and the rest engaged in agriculture at home, carrying out land improvement. The mountain land was only seven inches deep, so they organized labor to transport more than 400 dan of soil to improve 3.5 mu of land; they also plowed and harrowed the land one more time. This spring, before the farmers outside the cooperative had returned home, the cooperative's intensive spring plowing and production began. Originally, mountain fertilizer was mostly accumulated mountain ash, and other fertilizers were rare, but with the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, the strength increased, and the fertilizer problem was also easier to solve. The Chiyuan Cooperative obtained a national loan to buy eight yellow oxen, plus the cooperative's original four oxen, for a total of twelve oxen, accumulating more than 900 dan of cattle manure, and also bought a lot of cattle bones, manure cakes, and fertilizer powder to apply to the fields. With careful work and thick fertilizer, the crops grew very lushly. When agricultural work was not tight, the agricultural cooperative also signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to buy palm leaves to make palm clothes, and also helped people carry loads, work, and make tea. When the accounts were settled at the autumn harvest: the income from side occupations increased by 10% compared to 1953, the yield of rice increased by 31%, and the yield of sweet potatoes increased by 68%. The original grain-shortage households have all become grain-surplus households, and the entire cooperative sold a total of 55 dan of surplus grain to the state. Other agricultural cooperatives in the mountains, like the Chiyuan Cooperative, are gradually processing and fertilizing the land. In the past, they only hoed the weeds once and applied fertilizer once. Now, many cooperatives have hoed the weeds twice and applied fertilizer twice. In 1954, the average yield per mu of single-season rice in the entire district was only over 250 jin, and the yield of sweet potatoes was 1,000 jin. However, the better agricultural cooperatives have already achieved a yield of 400 jin per mu of single-season rice and 4,000 jin per mu of sweet potatoes. This has set an example for the development of mountain production.

Beginning to Overcome Natural Disasters

Natural disasters are a serious threat to mountain production. Because many mountain forests have been cut down and riverbeds are shallow, these mountainous areas are almost flooded with rain in the summer and drought when the weather is clear. When natural disasters strike suddenly, it is difficult for individual farmers to resist. It is much easier to resist disasters after agricultural cooperatives are established.

Houwangshan in Shihou Township, Ningde County, has 49 mu of farmland that is drought-prone when it is sunny, and there is often no harvest. Farmers couldn't think of a good way and planned to change to planting pine trees. After the establishment of the Minsheng Agricultural Cooperative in this township, they found an abandoned canal that had been abandoned for 35 years and mobilized the masses to repair it in two days. This canal was one chi deep, two chi wide, and more than 400 zhang long. Everyone also dug a reservoir at the end of the canal. In this way, more than 30 mu of farmland became paddy fields, and more than 10 mu of rain-fed fields would no longer be short of water. In total, grain production can be increased by more than 7,400 jin.

The land in Shuitian Township, Fuan County, is river beach land, and the tide can reach the big river beside the fields. When the tide comes, the river water rises and the fields can be irrigated by waterwheels. But water can only be wheeled during the time when the tide is high, and it is not possible when the water level drops. Therefore, this time for seizing water is very tight. Gao Nailing, the director of the Qianfeng Cooperative, said: "In the past, to wheel water once from the tide, two shifts of people had to be hired, and the wages for each person were one silver yuan. Each shift had eight people, and two shifts had a total of sixteen people, which would cost sixteen silver yuan. Who could afford to wheel water like that? So often we had to watch the rice seedlings die of drought." The situation is different after the establishment of the cooperative. Last year, there was an autumn drought, and the rice was all pregnant with ears. This was a drought that strangled the rice, and the farmers were very anxious. However, the several waterwheels of the Qianfeng and Shengli cooperatives kept ringing, and when the high tide came, they intercepted the tide day and night to irrigate the fields, finally rescuing the fields. Both cooperatives increased production.

Another enemy of mountain production is animal pests. Wild boars, monkeys, and wild chickens often spoil crops. Wild boars can eat several thousand sweet potato seedlings in one night. In 1953, animal pests alone spoiled the harvest of 30,000 dan of sweet potatoes in the entire district. Many farmers in the mountains did not sleep at night, knocking on bamboo instruments and blowing ox horns to prevent wild boars from attacking. The biggest problem in clearing wild boars is that cultivation contradicts hunting. To manage such a small piece of land, it is no longer possible to spare time to hunt animals. The contradiction is resolved by organizing agricultural cooperatives. The First Agricultural Cooperative of Henglin Township, Fuan County, organized a wild boar hunting team, built fifteen wild boar watchtowers, and watched for wild boars in the dark night to protect crops. The crops in the cooperative were less damaged than those of farmers outside the cooperative. Because the control of animal pests was organized, more than 1,200 animals have been exterminated in the entire special district this year, preventing damage to many crops.

Busy Farming No Longer Delays Busy Tea Harvesting

The Fuan Special District is a famous tea-producing area. However, in the past, tea production was low and the quality was poor. What was hindering the increase in tea production and quality? The main reason was that tea harvesting and tea making contradicted agricultural production, and tea-making technology was high and required certain equipment. Individual farmers lacked labor and funds, and they could not take care of both agriculture and tea industry. "Doing both agriculture and side occupations well" was something that farmers could not do for many years. In the first year of the establishment of the Xinkang Agricultural Tea Production Cooperative in Linglu Township, Fuan County, they accomplished what farmers had been unable to do for many years. This cooperative has a total of 340 mu of paddy fields and 140 mu of tea gardens. The entire cooperative has more than 110 full and semi-laborers. After the establishment of the cooperative, they divided the cultivation areas according to the distance of the fields and production needs, and divided the cooperative members into five production teams. Each team was equipped with two people with tea-making skills and three people with agricultural and side-occupation skills. Because the labor force was used uniformly, they solved the contradiction between busy farming and busy tea harvesting. Cooperative member Xie Jianghe has three mu of tea gardens and five mu of paddy fields. Last year, he did it alone and only took care of plowing and sowing. As a result, only 20% of the first spring tea was harvested. This year, after joining the cooperative, everything was taken care of. At the same time, unified management, division of labor and specialization not only had special personnel responsible for the preliminary processing and sale of tea, but also mobilized 45 female cooperative members to contract the picking of tea. This enabled the cooperative to extract more labor to engage in agriculture and side occupations. Therefore, this year, the spring plowing of this cooperative was timely, and the quality of the first spring tea was the best in the entire district. The price per dan increased by 60% compared to last year. The five laborers extracted to engage in side occupations in the village earned 804 yuan. Farmers inside and outside the township were surprised to see that their side occupations were doing so well and asked: "Where did you get so much effort?" Cooperative director Liu Deyong replied: "It's because we established an agricultural tea production cooperative."

The benefits of agricultural cooperatives have attracted the hearts of many farmers. Many mutual aid teams had plans to establish cooperatives this spring. Some are producing in linked groups; others are following the agricultural cooperatives and doing what the agricultural cooperatives do. More cooperatives have been established this autumn and spring than originally planned, and there is currently a trend of developing into nests and clusters. According to preliminary calculations, 1,367 mutual aid teams have already requested to establish cooperatives. The face of the Fuan Special District will have even greater and newer changes!

    农业合作化改变着福安地区的面貌
    曾毓秋
    在东海岸的福建省福安专区，自然条件是很复杂的。百分之七十以上的土地都是山地。耕地大部分是层层叠叠的梯田。只有很少的地方是山间小块平原地。自然灾害很多：春天涝，夏天旱，夏秋两季常有台风，随时都有虫灾，沿海人民还得向海潮作战，山区人民又为兽害所苦。山区人民是勤劳勇敢的，但他们一直找不到通向富裕的道路。
    一九五三年春天，福安地区的共产党组织领导农民试办了十四个农业生产合作社，大部分社都增了产。有三个社虽然受了严重旱灾，但也比社外农民少减产。从此，福安专区的人民开始看到了幸福的前途。一九五四年发展到一百一十个社，到秋季绝大部分社又都比社外农民增产了。柘荣县黄根乡四个社每亩田平均增产二成二，九个常年互助组每亩平均增产一成六，五个临时互助组平均增产一成二。农业合作社产量高的事实，吸引了更多的农民走到合作化的路上来。一九五四年秋到一九五五年七月，全区已有了一千六百六十六个社。入社农户有四万一千三百一十五户。全区七百七十三个乡中，有五百六十二个乡有了农业合作社。今年农业合作社春收作物又是空前的丰收，合作化的发展正在改变着大地的面貌和人们的思想。
    第一次长出了小麦
    周宁县东山乡是个被许多山坡围绕着的山乡。这个乡从来不种小麦；可是今年这乡农业合作社的土地上第一次长出了金黄的小麦。社员们用麦子磨面过了端午节。他们看见这珍珠似的麦粒，都忍不住赞叹起来，社员陈其浦说：“毛主席给我们想的办法好，办了社，黄土变黄金，过去不种东西的山园地也种出小麦来了。”这个山区解放前受到严重的糟踏，劳动力缺乏，地种得很粗糙，有不少田园被抛荒。老年人说：“这地方地瘦人穷，种不出什么好东西来。”农民怕肥料不够，连秧田都不种作物，水田一年种一季稻谷，旱地一年种一季甘薯，冬天就闲着不种什么。去年冬天，人民政府号召农民多种一季作物。农业合作社专为这事开了会，打算利用冬闲的山园地种五十亩小麦。种麦最主要的困难是缺肥料，要种五十亩地就得五百多担肥料。山地里要积点山灰、草灰，就得跑上二、三里地。秋收后要收甘薯，晒甘薯干，如果要冬种，又要积肥，而且这些活都要抢在晴天做，这样，劳力就有困难。单门独户的农家是无法克服这种困难的。农业合作社却可以合理使用劳力，困难也就容易克服了。他们留一部分人收甘薯，抽出一些人种麦，再抽出一些人积肥，几种农活穿插进行，终于种了五十亩小麦，结果每亩平均收了八十四斤，差不多顶上了半季稻谷。
    由于农业合作社带头冬种，加上农业合作社大发展，去冬今春福安专区各县普遍增加了冬种面积。全区今年春收粮食作物大麦、小麦、蚕豆、豌豆、马铃薯等大丰收，共收了三千五百万斤，比去年增产一千一百多万斤，占全区全年粮食增产任务百分之九十四。油菜也增产了一万九千多担，比去年增产百分之八十四多。农业合作社的成绩最为突出。福安县十二区冬小麦播种面积全区扩大百分之三十二点八，农业合作社却扩大了百分之二百二十七点八；油菜全区扩大了百分之六十六，农业合作社却扩大了百分之三百七十六点二；大麦全区扩大了百分之十一，农业合作社却扩大了百分之四百五十；豌豆全区扩大了百分之九十，农业合作社却扩大了百分之二百六十四点四。因为农业合作社对春收作物田间管理好，单位面积产量也比一般农民高。
    山村七月谷进仓
      福安县楼下乡是个山村，从来都是种的单季稻。前两年听说一个农场试种了连作稻，好多人不相信。去年春天刘奶佑互助组想试种一点。要种就先得改良土质。他们想改良王瑞喜的一亩三分田。一计算：吃饭除外，光工资就要四元八角，大家心都冷了。组员刘立春说：“现钱要这么多，那知收成究竟如何？”有的说：“万一土地不合，没收成，怎么办？”因此，就停下手了。
    去年秋天，这个互助组转成了民进农业合作社，办法多起来了。社里计划二十七亩田都要改良土壤，种连作稻。春节期间，社里每天出动了几十人，给二十七亩土地挑了一千三百多担肥土，上了二十多担绿肥，插上了连作稻。多上了肥，又勤除虫、除草，全社第一季早稻共收了一百四十四担，平均每亩收了五百二十五斤。比去年种单季稻每亩多收了一百斤左右。社员高兴地说：“第一季就收这么多，加上第二季，每亩要收它九百斤或一千斤。”喜讯传遍了全村，社外农民也说：“人讲台湾稻两熟，福州六月（夏历）谷进仓，因为那地是宝地，想不到我们山沟今年也出奇事，农业合作社真有本领。”
    今年全专区早稻面积扩大了几千亩，农业合作社扩大的最多。如寿宁和柘荣两个县，历来都是不种早稻的，今年却种了。寿宁全县种了二百五十二亩，农业合作社就种了二百二十九亩。柘荣县全县种了一百二十七亩，农业合作社就种了九十五亩。像这样单季改双季的新事，正不断地出现在山区里。
    从缺粮到余粮
    寿宁县处在高山地带，当地的农民，用这样的话来形容当地的山高：“车岭车上天，九岭过九年。”而地块又零碎，农民说：“一把秧苗插三丘”，“岩（指田壁）高如山，田小如斗”。耕作的困难是可以想像的。在这一带，土地很少上肥，又给雨水冲刷，一天天贫瘠下去。种田人不能完全指靠土地，必须出外搞些副业才能糊口。周宁县等几个山区县，和寿宁的情况差不多。周宁县礼门乡“每年只要正月一过，男人们便出门打棕衣，做泥工去了；夏历四月间回家，耕耙过一遍土，把禾苗下到田，六月底耘一次草，又出门去了，迟的要到年底才回来。像这样种田，每亩平均产量才二百斤多一点；生产出来的粮食年年不够吃。一九五三年冬天，这个乡的池园村何德祥互助组十五户共缺粮十担。一九五四年三月，这个组有十一户组成了池园农业合作社，情况就变了。他们抽出一部分人到外边搞副业，剩下的在家搞农业，进行土地加工。山地田土只有七寸深，他们组织劳力运进四百多担土，改良了三亩五分田；又多耕耙了一次田地。 这年春天，社外农民还没回家来，社里紧张的春耕生产就开始了。本来山地肥料多是积山灰，其他肥料很少，但成立起农业合作社，力量大了，肥料问题也好解决了。池园社得到国家贷款买了八头黄牛，加上社里原有的四头牛一共有了十二头牛，积了九百多担牛粪，又买了许多牛骨、粪干和肥田粉下到田里。工精料厚，庄稼长得十分肥壮。农活不紧的时候，农业合作社又同供销社订了合同，买棕片打棕衣，还帮人担挑、做工、制茶。到秋收时把账一算：副业收入比一九五三年增加一成，农业的水稻增产三成一，甘薯增产六成八。原来的缺粮户都变成了余粮户，全社共卖了五十五担余粮给国家。山区的其他农业合作社也像池园社一样，正在逐步做到加工加肥。过去只锄一遍草，施一次肥。现在许多社都做到了除二遍草，施二次肥。一九五四年全区单季稻田平均每亩不过收二百五十多斤，甘薯收一千斤。但较好的农业合作社单季稻已达到每亩收四百斤，甘薯每亩收四千斤。这就为山区生产的发展做出了榜样。
    开始战胜了自然灾害
    自然灾害是山区生产的严重威胁。因为山林多被砍伐，河床又浅，这些山区在夏季差不多是一雨成涝，天晴即旱。当自然灾害突然袭击的时候，单门独户的农民是很难抗拒的。成立起农业合作社抗灾就方便多了。
    宁德县石厚乡后望山，有四十九亩农地，一晴就旱，经常没收成。农民们想不出好办法，打算改种松树。这个乡的民生农业合作社成立后，找到一条荒废了三十五年的水渠，发动群众在两天内把它修好了。这条水渠有一尺深，二尺宽，四百多丈长。大家又在渠尾开了一个蓄水池。这样，三十多亩农地变成了水田，十几亩靠天水的田再不会断水了。总计可以增产粮食七千四百多斤。
    福安县水田乡的地是河滩地，潮水可以达到田边的大河。潮水来时，河水涨满，可以车水灌田。但只有在潮水涨满的时间里可以车水，水位下降就不行了。因此，这段抢水的时间是十分紧张的。前锋社社长高奶凌说：“过去，车一次潮水，得请两班人，每人的工资要一块银元，每班八人，两班共十六人，就要十六块银元，这谁车得起？所以常常只得看着禾苗活活地旱死。”办了社，光景就不一样了。去年逢上秋旱，稻子都孕穗了，这是卡着脖子的旱，种田人都是十分心焦的。但是，前锋、胜利两个社的几驾水车不停地响，当大潮到来的时候，他们连夜截潮灌田，终于把田地抢救回来了。两个社都增了产。
    山区生产的另一个敌人是兽害。山猪、山猴、山鸡，经常糟蹋庄稼。山猪在一夜之间，就可以吃掉好几千株甘薯。一九五三年，全区仅兽害就糟蹋了三万担甘薯的收成。山区的许多农民，夜夜不睡，手里敲着竹器，吹着牛角，防备山猪来侵袭。清剿山猪最大的一个问题，就是耕作同猎兽相矛盾，要经营那么一小块土地，就再也抽不出手来猎兽了。组织了农业合作社，矛盾就解决了。福安县横林乡第一农业合作社组织了一个打山猪队，盖了十五座看猪楼，在黑夜里看山猪，保庄稼。社里的庄稼就比社外农民的少受损害。因为组织起来捕灭兽害，今年全专区灭兽一千二百多头，使不少庄稼免受损害。
    农忙再不误茶忙
    福安专区是有名的茶叶产区。但是，过去茶叶产量低，质量差。是什么东西妨碍着茶叶产量质量的提高呢？主要原因是采茶制茶和农业生产有矛盾，而且制茶的技术性高，要有一定设备。个体农民劳力不足，资金也不足，顾了农业就顾不了茶业。“农业副业齐做好”，这是农民多年来办不到的事。福安县岭路乡新康农茶生产合作社建社第一年，农民们多年办不到的事他们就办到了。这个社共有田三百四十亩，茶园一百四十亩。全社有全、半劳力一百一十多人。办社后，他们便根据田地远近和生产需要，划分了耕作区，社员分成五个生产组，每组配备有制茶技术的二人，有农副业技术的三人。由于劳力统一使用，他们便解决了农忙茶忙的矛盾。社员谢江和有三亩茶园五亩田，去年一个人干，只顾住了犁田、播种，结果头春茶只采了百分之二十，今年入社，样样都顾到了。同时，统一经营，分工分业，不但有专人负责茶叶的初制和出卖，还动员了四十五个女社员，包干采摘茶叶。这就使社里能抽出更多的劳力去搞农业和副业。因此，今年这个社春耕及时，头春茶叶品质又是全区最好的，每担价格比去年增加百分之六十。抽出的五个劳力在本村搞副业，收入八百零四元。乡里乡外农民看到他们副业搞得好，都惊奇地问：“你们那里来的这么多功夫？”社长刘德永回答说：“就是因为办了农茶生产合作社。”
    农业合作社的好处吸引了许多农民的心，许多互助组在今年春天就有了建社的打算。有的是联组生产；有的是跟着农业合作社学，农业合作社做什么，他们也做什么。去秋今春，办起的社都比原先计划的数字多，目前更有成窝成片发展的趋势了。据初步计算，已经有一千三百六十七个互助组要求办社。福安专区的面貌将会有更大更新的变化！
