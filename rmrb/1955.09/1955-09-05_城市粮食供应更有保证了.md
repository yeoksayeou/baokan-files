Supporting the Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns

    City Grain Supply More Guaranteed
    Zhang Xulian
    I am a loading and unloading worker at the No. 1 Warehouse of the Harbin Municipal Grain Bureau. On the morning of August 26th, during a break from loading and unloading grain sacks, a comrade explained the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns" issued by the State Council in detail. This made me clearly realize that this is a major measure in our country's grain work and a law that everyone must abide by.
    After July this year, the state called on all urban residents to formulate grain consumption plans for their families. I discussed this matter with my wife. At first, my wife was a little worried, always afraid that it would "not be enough to eat." I said, "You're just afraid of going hungry!" I explained to her in detail that fearing starvation was a thing of the old society. I used to carry bags at the dock all day, and the money I earned wasn't enough to buy rice. I was so hungry that my legs were weak and my eyes were blurred. When I put a two-hundred-pound bag on my shoulder, cold sweat would break out on my forehead, and my feet couldn't stand on the springboard. Especially during the last few years of Japanese rule, even if you earned money, you couldn't buy rice to eat. But today is the new society. The state guarantees our workers' right to work. I have a job, and my family has enough to eat and wear, especially since the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Our family receives enough grain on time. The state is calling on us to formulate grain consumption plans for the sake of national construction and to ensure that everyone has grain to eat. When I told her this, she became happy and formulated a grain consumption plan to save three catties of grain per person per month.
    When I learned about the various provisions of the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns" issued by the State Council, I felt even more that the state's regulations were reasonable. For example, the state stipulates that we general heavy manual laborers should receive forty to forty-nine catties, but I can eat my fill with forty-five catties each month. Recently, my family also learned how to steam buns with potatoes mixed with flour, which can save more grain for the country and better improve our own lives. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the "Provisional Measures for Rationed Grain Supply in Cities and Towns." With the regulations on fixed grain rations, the grain supply will be more reasonable and guaranteed. The government's meticulous care for the people's lives further encourages us to work better for national construction and do more work to realize the country's first Five-Year Plan.

专栏：拥护市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法

    城市粮食供应更有保证了
    张绪连
    我是哈尔滨市粮食局第一仓库装卸工人。八月二十六日上午，在装卸粮袋的空隙时间，有个同志向我详细地讲了国务院发布的“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”，使我清楚地认识到这是我国粮食工作的重大措施，也是人人必须遵守的法令。
    今年七月以后，国家号召我们城市居民家家制定用粮计划，我就和我的爱人商量了这件事，开始的时候，我爱人也有一个小心眼，总是害怕“不够吃”。我就说：“你是饿怕了！”我详细地向她说清了，怕挨饿的那是旧社会的事，我在码头上成天扛袋子，挣的钱不够买米的，饿得我腿发酸，眼发花，二百来斤的袋子往肩上一放，脑瓜门上直冒虚汗，脚跟站不住跳板，特别是日本鬼子统治的那最后几年，就是赚两个钱也是买不到米吃啊。可是，今天是新社会，国家保障了我们工人的劳动权利，我有工作做，家中有吃有穿，特别是国家实行粮食统购统销政策，咱家按时得到了足够的吃粮。国家号召咱们制定用粮计划，是为了国家建设，也是为了保证人人有粮吃。当我向她这么一讲，她也高兴起来了，制定了每人每月节约三斤粮食的用粮计划。
    当我知道了国务院发布的“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”的各项规定，我更感觉到国家的规定是合理的。像国家规定我们一般重体力工人是四十至四十九斤，可是，我每个月有四十五斤就吃得饱饱的了。最近我家又学会了土豆掺面蒸馒头的方法，还能为国家节约更多的粮食，也会更好地来改善我们自己的生活。所以，我从心里拥护“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”。有了粮食定量的规定，粮食的供应就更合理而有保证了。政府这样无微不至地关怀人民生活，也就更加鼓舞我们更好地为国家建设而劳动，为实现国家第一个五年计划而做更多的工作。
