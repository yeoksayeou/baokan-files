To Improve Inland Water Transport Capacity to Meet National Construction Needs
    Huainan Coal Mine's Yangtze River Terminal Port to be Expanded

In accordance with the requirements of national economic development, the Ministry of Communications has decided to expand the Yangtze River terminal port of the Huainan Coal Mine. The construction preparation work for the port is now being actively carried out, and construction will officially begin soon.

The Yangtze River terminal port of the Huainan Coal Mine is located at Yuxikou, fifteen kilometers downstream of Wuhu Port. Coal from the Huainan Coal Mine is transported by the Huainan Railway to the railway terminal station, and then transferred from the port to Daye, Shanghai, and other industrial areas along the Yangtze River.

The output of the Huainan Coal Mine has been continuously increasing since liberation. The output in 1954 increased nearly doubled compared to 1950. However, the port's throughput is only 800,000 tons. In addition, the port's equipment is simple and the coastline often collapses, making it far from capable of undertaking future coal transportation tasks. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications decided to expand the Huainan Coal Mine terminal port into a port with an annual throughput of 2.5 million tons by 1957. (It is planned to expand the port to an annual throughput of 6 million tons by 1962.)

In order to select the port site, the General Bureau of Navigation Engineering of the Ministry of Communications sent engineering designers to conduct preliminary reconnaissance and measurement and drilling work to select the construction site. These engineering designers collected original hydrological, meteorological, geological and other data, inspected the topography near Yuxikou, and preliminarily drafted four port sites on the north bank of the Yangtze River where coal ports could be built. After on-site inspection and research by Soviet experts from the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Communications, it was finally decided to expand the port at the original Yuxikou port. Yuxikou is the terminal station of the Huainan Railway, so there is no need to lay more new railway lines, and some of the original equipment can be used, which can save a lot of funds.

The main outgoing materials from the port are Huainan coal, and the main incoming materials are grain and wood. The imported timber is mainly pit wood for the Huainan Coal Mine and construction timber for urban and rural areas along the Huainan Railway. Coal is bulky and large in quantity, so it is not suitable for manual loading and unloading. Therefore, the main production operation of the port is mechanized operation, supplemented by a very small amount of manpower.

After the expansion of the Yangtze River terminal port of the Huainan Coal Mine is completed, it will greatly reduce the transportation load of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. The Huainan coal transported by the southern section of the Jinpu Railway can mostly be exported from this port in the future, using the cheap water transportation of the Yangtze River to complete the task. This will rationally use national transportation tools, so that the railway can complete the transportation work that needs to be undertaken more urgently by the railway. At the same time, it will also make full use of the vast rivers of the motherland, improve water transport capacity, and reduce water transport costs (the current coal transport cost is 1.46 yuan per ton, which will be reduced to 0.44 yuan to 0.53 yuan after the port is built), giving full play to the role of inland water transport in the national economy. Now the workers on the construction site are preparing for the submerged row revetment, and when the Yangtze River water level is slightly lower, they can fully and officially start construction. More than a year later, people will be able to see huge barge fleets of 3,000 tons and 5,000 tons coming and going in this magnificent modern port.

    提高内河运输能力适应国家建设需要
    淮南煤矿长江终点港即将扩建
    根据国民经济发展的要求，交通部决定扩建淮南煤矿长江终点港。该港的施工准备工作现在正积极进行，不久就可以正式动工。
    淮南煤矿长江终点港在芜湖港下游十五公里的裕溪口。淮南煤矿的煤由淮南铁路运至铁路终点站后，再由该港转运到大冶、上海及长江沿岸其他工业地区。
    淮南煤矿的生产量解放后不断增加。一九五四年的产量就比一九五○年增加了将近一倍。而该港的吞吐量才有八十万吨。加上该港设备简陋，岸线经常崩坍，远不能担负起今后的煤运任务。因此，交通部决定在一九五七年把淮南煤矿终点港扩建成一个年吞吐量为二百五十万吨的港口。（一九六二年准备扩建到年吞吐量为六百万吨的港口。）
    为了选定该港港址，交通部航务工程总局曾派工程设计人员实地进行了初步踏勘和选择建港址的测量钻探工作。这些工程设计人员收集了原始的水文、气象、地质等资料，视察了裕溪口附近的地形，在长江北岸可以建造煤港的地方初步拟定了四个港址。又经过地质部、水利部和交通部苏联专家的实地视察研究，最后决定在原裕溪口港口进行扩建。裕溪口是淮南铁路的终点站，不需要敷设更多的新铁路线，可以利用一部分原有设备，这样可以节省一大笔资金。
    该港输出的物资以淮南煤炭为主，输入以粮食和木材为大宗。输入木材主要是淮南煤矿的坑木和淮南铁路沿线城乡的建筑木材。煤炭笨重而且量大，不宜于人工装卸，所以该港的主要生产作业以机械化操作，辅以极小部分人力。
    淮南煤矿长江终点港扩建成以后，将大大地减轻津浦铁路南段运输量的负荷，用津浦铁路南段运的淮南煤，以后大都可从本港出口，利用长江价廉的水运完成任务。这样就合理地使用了国家运输工具，使铁路尽量能完成更迫切需要用铁路来担负的运输工作。同时也充分利用了祖国广大的河流，提高水运能力，降低水运成本（现在煤运成本为每吨一点四六元，该港建成以后，将降低为零点四四元到零点五三元）发挥内河水运在国民经济中所起的作用。现在工地上的工人正在作沉排护岸的准备工作，等长江水位稍低，就可全面正式动工。一年多以后，人们就可以看到巨大的载重三千吨和五千吨的大驳轮队在这雄伟的现代化的港口来回出入了。
