Xinhua News Agency, September 26th. The National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference continued on its seventh day with Vice Minister of National Defense Tan Zheng delivering a report titled "Defending the Motherland is the Sacred Duty of Youth."

Tan Zheng congratulated the youth activists present – the experts in building and defending the motherland – and pointed out that strengthening China's national defense and safeguarding the socialist cause of the motherland requires the efforts of all the people of the country, especially the youth comrades, in their respective posts. He concluded by particularly encouraging the youth activists in the armed forces to always work with the youth and people of the whole country to dedicate themselves to defending the motherland and the people's peaceful labor.

At today's meeting, more youth activists continued to put forward proposals or participated in the labor competitions that had already been launched. Twenty-nine rural educated youth from Zhejiang, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces, who were attending the conference, after full deliberation beforehand, proposed to the nation's rural educated youth at the meeting today: during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, each person should strive to help at least one illiterate rural youth escape illiteracy. Many of these twenty-nine proposers are outstanding youth on the agricultural production front or excellent teachers in people's schools.

Thirty rural youth activists from Henan Province who attended the conference also proposed to the nation's rural youth to launch a "thousand carts, ten thousand dan" manure accumulation campaign this winter and next spring. In their proposal, they said: The rural youth of Henan Province launched a "marching towards green grass, thousand carts, ten thousand dan grass-cutting and manure accumulation campaign" at the end of August this year. Taking just the villages where they thirty are located as an example, 904 young people have participated in this campaign and have accumulated a total of 11,351 carts of fertilizer, creating favorable conditions for increasing grain production. Their proposal was warmly responded to by the rural youth activists from Jiangxi Province who attended the conference, and they also put forward specific figures guaranteeing manure accumulation at the meeting.

Wang Shouwen, the furnace chief of the No. 8 open hearth furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, was greatly encouraged after hearing the competition terms of the youth steelmaking furnace of Benxi Iron and Steel Company and the youth steelmaking class of Daye Steel Works yesterday. Today, he represented their No. 8 open hearth furnace in participating in this competition.
