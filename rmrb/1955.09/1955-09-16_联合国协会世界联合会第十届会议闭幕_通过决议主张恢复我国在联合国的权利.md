    通过决议主张恢复我国在联合国的权利
    新华社十三日讯　曼谷消息：联合国协会世界联合会第十届会议已经在十一日闭幕。
    会议通过了主张让中国进入联合国的决议。在表决时，除了美国代表投反对票、泰国和菲律宾代表弃权以外，其他正式会员国的代表都投了赞成票。在这以前，会议的政治委员会曾经讨论联合国会员资格的问题。匈牙利代表在会上说，任何国际事件没有中华人民共和国参加，就不会得到圆满的效果。他指出：中华人民共和国被剥夺在联合国中的合法席位是值得控诉的，为了促进和平，必须马上恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位。
    会议还通过的另一项决议，对最近国际局势的改善表示满意。决议说，日内瓦会议是这种改善的一个最突出的例子，希望即将举行的四国外长会议以及联合国裁军委员会小组委员会和一切旨在消除世界紧张局势的会谈获得成功。
