    Curbing Serious Waste in Publicly Funded Healthcare
    Cao Wenyong
    The implementation of publicly funded healthcare is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of our country's political system, embodying the deep concern of the Party and the government for the health of state personnel. In the three years since its implementation, publicly funded healthcare has greatly advanced the development of our country's healthcare system, improving the health of state personnel and significantly reducing illness. This has created favorable conditions for the victorious realization of our socialist cause.
    However, it should be pointed out that many state personnel lack a correct understanding of this important welfare measure. They seek hospitalization or medication even when they are not particularly ill, thus causing serious waste in publicly funded healthcare. The solution to this problem lies first in correcting the attitude of each of our staff towards publicly funded healthcare and combating all acts of arbitrary waste of medicine.
    The waste in publicly funded healthcare manifests itself in several ways.
    Many state personnel regard publicly funded healthcare as a material enjoyment. It seems that not seeing a doctor or taking medicine with publicly funded healthcare is a "loss". Therefore, they see a doctor even when they are not sick, take medicine even when they should not, and are hospitalized even when it is unnecessary. Examples of this are countless. Shi Chunyan, Minister of the Armed Forces Department of the Dazhou County Committee in Sichuan Province, once had a sour taste in his mouth after eating oranges and called a doctor to diagnose him. The diagnosis revealed that it was not a disease at all, but due to eating oranges. There was also a staff member of the Dazhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office named Wu Sanquan who called a doctor in the middle of the night. When the doctor arrived and asked him what was wrong, he said, "I can't sleep. Please diagnose what's wrong with me?" A staff member of Dalian Institute of Technology, suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and arthritis, both chronic diseases, could not be effectively treated in the short term. However, he visited the clinic sixty-four times in two and a half months, taking three hundred and fifty doses of Chinese medicine alone. If he took three doses a day, he would still have one hundred and twenty-five doses left. Taking such a large amount of Chinese medicine is not only a waste of state property, but also harmful to the patient's health. A staff member of the former Industry Department of the People's Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region once bought enough tissue fluid with public funds for one person to inject for six years, totaling one thousand five hundred ampoules, and this tissue fluid would deteriorate after six months. These staff members were afraid of "losing out," so they bought as much as possible. Anyway, they didn't spend their own money, and if they couldn't use it, they would put it away and throw it away when it went bad. They took this wrong attitude towards state property. As for taking expensive medicines for minor illnesses and taking tonics when not ill, this is also a relatively common phenomenon. If the doctor does not prescribe tonics, they will force the doctor to prescribe them. This is what a staff member of Jinzhou Public Security Bureau did. He wanted the people in the health clinic to prescribe tonics. The people in the health clinic said, "This needs to be approved by the higher authorities." He said angrily, "I am your superior." He forced the doctor to prescribe a prescription. Zhongyang County in Shanxi Province once conducted a survey. Out of one hundred and two people taking medicine in five units in one month, fifty-two were taking tonics, and the cost of tonics accounted for 70% of the total cost of medicine. In addition, some people have a special interest in staying in hospitals. They want to be hospitalized even when they are not sick, and they are unwilling to leave once they are in. A staff member in Heilongjiang Province did not want to be discharged from the hospital after recovering from his illness. When measuring his temperature, he put the thermometer on a hot water bag, causing the temperature on the thermometer to rise, in an attempt to deceive the doctor. As for the hospitalization of general minor illnesses, it is even more common, and almost every hospital has it. This is also a shameful act of using the state's welfare system to achieve personal illegitimate enjoyment.
    Let's take a look at the situation on the medical staff's side. Some medical staff take an irresponsible attitude towards the implementation of the publicly funded healthcare system. They mistakenly believe that since it is the state's money, why offend the patient? Therefore, they do not conscientiously grasp the medical principles and accommodate the patient's unreasonable demands. They prescribe whatever medicine the patient wants, and they prescribe as much as the patient wants. For example, a doctor in the Luliang County Sanatorium in Yunnan Province prescribed thirty ampoules of streptomycin to a patient at one time. The patient thought it was too little, so the doctor immediately added thirty more ampoules. Of course, this kind of doctor will be "well received" by those patients who like to take advantage of the state, but this "good reputation" is exchanged for sacrificing state property. A medical worker in Qingdao took X-rays for people who didn't need them in order to practice taking X-rays. Some patients didn't want to take them, so he said, "It's publicly funded healthcare anyway, so take one!" This bad attitude of being good at being generous with the state's money actually fuels the wasteful atmosphere among state personnel.
    Some medical staff also take advantage of the convenience of their work to prescribe drugs for themselves indiscriminately, and the waste is often more serious. For example, Dr. Li Cunxiao of the Sixth District Health Clinic in Huailai County, Hebei Province, was not sick, but in order to enjoy publicly funded healthcare, he said that he had neurasthenia and took a large amount of Six Combination Vitamins, Tianwang Buxin Pills, Malt Cod Liver Oil, and Ginseng Tonics in a short period of time. Sometimes he disliked the taste of the medicine and threw it away after eating half of it. According to the statistical materials from various regions, the most serious waste is the medical institution itself. A hospital in Liaoning Province used forty-three bottles of Aloes Compound Elixir (tonic) for publicly funded healthcare in one month, of which thirty-four bottles were used by the hospital staff. From Tianjin's statistics in 1953, health workers accounted for only about one-tenth of the total number of people enjoying publicly funded healthcare in the city, but the overspending on publicly funded healthcare accounted for about one-quarter of the city's overspending.
    There is also a situation in which some state personnel and medical staff engage in illegal and undisciplined acts of stealing state medicines and equipment. There are many ways to steal, such as claiming more medicine, using their position to fraudulently claim a large number of medicines for private ownership, or altering documents and falsely reporting claims. For example, Li Chengyin (who has been dismissed), the former deputy section chief of the Health Section of Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, once suffered from a mild cold and used his position to claim thirty-five ampoules of streptomycin, six bottles of vitamin pills, seventeen ampoules of vitamin injections, twenty-three ampoules of glucose, and dozens of ampoules of Anagan, Calcium Sugar, and Calcium Bromide, totaling 315 yuan in RMB. Similar thefts have occurred in Sichuan, Henan, Liaoning, and other places.
    It is clear that the above three situations cannot but cause serious waste and loss of state property. In 1954, the expenditure on publicly funded healthcare in many areas across the country exceeded the budget, and the main reason lies here. Taking Shanghai, Beijing, and Dalian as examples, it was initially estimated that the overspending in 1954 would reach 400,000 yuan or 1.5 million yuan. The average expenditure on publicly funded healthcare in Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, in the first half of 1954 accounted for 181.6% of the total budget for publicly funded healthcare. Obviously, without overcoming the serious waste in publicly funded healthcare, the overspending situation in various regions cannot be fundamentally improved.
    This serious waste phenomenon fully illustrates that the concept of cherishing state property is extremely weak among many of our staff members (including medical staff). They arbitrarily squander the state's money to satisfy their personal enjoyment. This is a serious selfish act, and this behavior is not commensurate with the glorious title of a state staff member. In order to curb this wasteful behavior, we must first start by correcting the attitude of state personnel towards publicly funded healthcare. For those who seek treatment, Party organizations and health departments in various regions must educate them to cherish the state's medicines, trust the doctor's diagnosis, and overcome the erroneous mentality of seeking medical treatment and taking medicine indiscriminately whether they are sick or not. For medical staff, they must be educated to cherish the state's medical property, grasp medical principles, and patiently persuade and educate those state personnel who seek medical treatment and medicine indiscriminately, and never accommodate the patient's unreasonable demands. As long as each of our medical staff corrects their attitude, this can be fully achieved. If both patients and medical staff can consciously treat publicly funded healthcare with a correct attitude, then waste can be reduced or avoided.
    Secondly, the lack of sufficient understanding of the significance of implementing publicly funded healthcare and the lack of specific measures to ensure the implementation of publicly funded healthcare and prevent waste in some areas of the health department are also important reasons for the current serious waste. Therefore, the health departments in various regions should earnestly strengthen their leadership over publicly funded healthcare work and formulate measures to improve the management system.
    Finally, those who dare to steal state medicines and supplies must be severely punished. In order to prevent the continued occurrence of such theft, the health departments in various regions should establish a strict management system for medicines and supplies and improve the procedures for reviewing financial reimbursement.

    制止公费医疗中的严重浪费
    曹文庸
    实行公费医疗是我国政治制度优越性的具体表现，它体现了党和政府对国家工作人员健康的深切的关怀。三年来，由于实行了公费医疗，大大推进了我国保健事业的发展，使国家工作人员的健康情况得到了改善，疾病大大减少。这给我国社会主义事业的胜利实现创造了有利条件。
    但是应该指出，有不少国家工作人员对这一项重要的福利措施是缺乏正确认识的，他们没有什么病就要住院或吃药，因而造成了公费医疗中的严重浪费现象。填塞这个漏洞的办法，首先是端正我们每个工作人员对公费医疗的态度，并同一切任意浪费医药的行为作斗争。
    公费医疗的浪费现象表现在几个方面。
    不少国家工作人员把公费医疗看成是一种物质享受，似乎有了公费医疗不看病不吃药是“白吃亏”的，因此没有病也找医生，不该吃药也吃药，不该住院也住院。这类例子是举不胜举的。四川省达县县委会武装部部长石春彦，有一次吃了广柑后口中发酸，就打电话找医生来诊断，诊断结果根本不是病，是因为吃了广柑的缘故。达县专署还有个工作人员叫吴三铨，半夜打电话找医生看病，医生赶来问他什么病，他说：“我睡不着觉，请你诊断一下是什么病？”大连工学院一个工作人员，患肺结核和关节炎，这两种病都是慢性病，本来不是短期突击治疗可以见效的。但是，他在两个半月里看了六十四次门诊，仅中药就拿了三百五十付。如果每天吃三付，还剩余一百二十五付。这样大量服用中药，不但浪费了国家财产，而且对病人健康也是有害无益的。原内蒙古自治区人民政府工业部的一个工作人员，一次就用公费买了够一个人六年注射用的组织液，计一千五百支，而这种组织液在六个月后就要变质。这些工作人员唯恐自己“吃亏”，因此，能多买就尽量多买，反正自己不花钱，用不了就搁起，坏了就扔掉。他们就采取这种错误态度来对待国家的财产。至于小病吃贵重药，无病吃补药，也是比较普遍的现象。如果医生不给开补药，他们就会强迫医生开。锦州市公安局一个工作人员就是这样，他要卫生所的人开补药，卫生所的人说：“这要经上级批准的。”他就生气地说：“我就是你们的上级。”强迫医生开方。山西省中阳县曾进行过一次统计，五个单位一个月中吃药的计一百○二人，而其中吃补药的就有五十二人，吃补药的花费占总药费的百分之七十。此外，某些人对住医院的兴趣特别大，没有病也想住院，进去了还不肯出来。黑龙江省一个工作人员病好了不肯出院，试体温时竟将体温表放在热水袋上，使表上温度升高，企图欺骗医生。至于一般小病住院的情况则更为普遍，几乎那一个医院都有。这也是利用国家的福利制度来达到个人非份的享受的可耻行为。
    再看一看医务工作人员方面的情况。有些医务人员对公费医疗办法的实施抱着不负责任的态度，他们错误地认为反正花的是国家的钱，何必去得罪病人，因而不认真地掌握医疗原则，迁就病人的无理要求。病人要什么药，就开什么药，要多少，就开多少。如云南省陆良县疗养院一个医生给一个病人一次就开链霉素三十支，病人嫌少，这个医生立即增加三十支。当然，这类医生是会得到那些爱讨国家便宜的病人的“好评”的，可是这种“好评”是用牺牲国家财产的办法换来的。青岛市有个医务人员为了练习拍爱克斯光片的技术，给本来无需拍片子的人拍了片子，有的病人不愿拍，他就说：“反正是公费医疗，你就拍一张吧！”这种善于慷国家之慨的恶劣态度，实际上是助长了国家工作人员浪费的风气。
    医务人员中也有人利用工作的方便，给自己滥开药品，其浪费情节往往更为严重。如河北省怀来县六区卫生所的李存孝医师，本来没有病，但是为了享受公费医疗，就说自己神经衰弱，在短期内服用了大量的六合维生素、天王补心丸、麦精鱼肝油和人参补剂等，有时嫌药的味道不好，吃一半就扔掉了。根据各地区的统计材料来看，浪费最严重的就是医疗机构本身。辽宁省某医院在一个月里公费医疗用去爱罗补汁（补药）四十三瓶，其中本院工作人员用去的就有三十四瓶。从天津市一九五三年统计来看，卫生人员只占全市享受公费医疗的人数的十分之一左右，但是，超支的公费医疗经费却占全市超支经费的四分之一左右。
    还有一种情况是：某些国家工作人员和医务人员有盗窃国家药品器材的违法乱纪行为。盗窃的办法很多，有的是多领药品；有的是利用职权冒领大批药品归私人所有；有的是涂改单据、虚报冒领。例如，黑龙江省讷河县前卫生科副科长李成荫（已撤职），有一次患轻感冒就利用职权领去链霉素三十五支、维生素丸六瓶、维生素注射剂十七支、葡萄糖二十三支，安那加、糖钙、溴化钙各数十支、计折合人民币三百一十五元。四川、河南、辽宁及其他各地也都有类似的盗窃的事情发生。
    很明白，上面三种情况都不能不造成国家财产的严重浪费和损失。一九五四年全国各地不少地区的公费医疗开支都超出预算，主要原因就在这里。以上海、北京、旅大三市为例，一九五四年初步估计超支达四十万元或一百五十万元不等；河南省信阳专区一九五四年上半年的公费医疗开支平均占公费医疗总预算的百分之一百八十一点六。显然，不克服公费医疗中的严重的浪费，各地超支的情况是不可能得到根本改善的。
    这种严重的浪费现象充分说明，我们许多工作人员（包括医务工作人员）爱护国家财产的观念极端薄弱，他们任意挥霍国家的钱来满足个人的享受，这是一种严重的自私行为，这种行为是同一个国家工作人员的光荣称号不相称的。为了制止这种浪费行为，首先就要从端正国家工作人员对公费医疗的态度着手。对治病的人来说，各地党组织和卫生部门必须教育他们爱护国家的医药，相信医生的诊断，克服有病无病乱投医乱吃药的错误心理。对医务人员来说，必须教育他们爱惜国家的医药财产，掌握医疗原则，对那些乱投医乱要药的国家工作人员进行耐心地说服教育，决不迁就病人的无理要求。只要我们每个医务人员端正了态度，这一点是完全可以做到的。如果病人和医务人员都能自觉地以正确的态度对待公费医疗，那末浪费现象就能减少或避免。
    其次，有些地区的卫生部门对实施公费医疗的意义认识不足，对如何保证公费医疗的实施和防止浪费的发生缺少具体办法，也是造成目前严重浪费的一个重要原因。因此，各地卫生部门应该切实加强对公费医疗工作的领导，订出改善管理制度的办法。
    最后，对于敢于盗窃国家医药用品的人，必须予以严厉制裁。为了防止这种盗窃行为的继续发生，各地卫生部门应该建立严格的医药用品管理制度，健全审查财经报销手续。
