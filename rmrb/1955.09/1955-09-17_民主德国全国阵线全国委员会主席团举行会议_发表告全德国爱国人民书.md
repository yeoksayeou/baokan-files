Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th. The Presidium of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany held a meeting on the 15th to discuss the current tasks of the German people in the struggle for peace and the restoration of unity.

Those attending the meeting included Presidium members Dieckmann, Ulbricht, Nuschke, as well as representatives of scientists, labor heroes, and farmers, and representatives from West Germany. Afterwards, a letter to all patriotic people of Germany was issued.

The letter stated: In Geneva and Moscow, the policy of rational consultation and understanding has triumphed over the "policy of strength" and the Cold War policy. We should attribute this victory to the unwavering struggle of the people of the world for peace and the peace policies of the Soviet Union and the countries of the democratic camp. The German people welcome this victory with satisfaction because they know that only in the spirit of mutual understanding and rapprochement can peace in Europe be guaranteed and the motherland be reunited in peace and freedom.

The letter calls on all German people to carry out the following tasks: 1. Strengthen the struggle against the Paris Agreements and against militarization, and resolutely support the establishment of a European collective security system; 2. Strengthen and consolidate the German Democratic Republic in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life; 3. Demand that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany hold negotiations with the government of the German Democratic Republic on an equal footing in order to gradually bring the two parts of Germany closer together and achieve unity—in this regard, the first task should be to formulate an all-German opinion for the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference; 4. Expand and strengthen the friendly ties between the people of East and West Germany. The letter points out that the All-German Conference must accomplish the task of easing the situation and enabling Germans to understand and approach each other.

    民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团举行会议
    发表告全德国爱国人民书
    新华社柏林十六日电  民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团十五日举行会议，讨论德国人民在争取和平和恢复统一斗争中的当前的任务。
    出席会议的，有主席团委员狄克曼、乌布利希、努舍克等人，还有科学家、劳动英雄和农民的代表以及从西德来的代表。会后发表了告全德国爱国人民书。
    告人民书说：在日内瓦和莫斯科，理智的协商和谅解的政策战胜了“实力政策”和冷战政策。我们应当把这个胜利归功于世界人民争取和平的坚定不移的斗争以及苏联和民主阵营各国的和平政策。德国人民以满意的心情欢迎这个胜利，因为他们知道：只有本着彼此谅解与接近的精神，欧洲的和平才有保证，祖国才能够在和平、自由中重新统一起来。
    告人民书号召全德国人民执行下面的任务：一、加强反对巴黎协定、反对军国主义化的斗争，坚决拥护建立欧洲集体安全体系；二、在政治、经济和文化生活各方面来加强和巩固德意志民主共和国；三、要求德意志联邦共和国政府同德意志民主共和国政府在平等的基础上举行谈判，以便德国两个部分逐步接近而达到统一——在这方面，第一个任务应该是为日内瓦四国外长会议制定出一个全德的意见；四、扩大和加强德国东、西两部人民的友好联系。告人民书指出：全德会议必须完成这样的任务：缓和局势，使德国人彼此谅解和接近。
