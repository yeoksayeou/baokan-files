    An overpass is being built at the intersection of the Baolan Railway and the Longhai Railway. After the overpass is completed and open to traffic, Baolan Railway trains will cross the Longhai Railway on the bridge, and the two railways can simultaneously cross and pass trains, so that transportation efficiency will not be affected.
    The overpass adopts a steel frame structure and will stand in the distance opposite the nearby Yellow River arch bridge after completion.

    包兰陇海路交叉处建跨线桥
    在包兰铁路和陇海铁路的交叉处，开始建设一座跨线桥。这座跨线桥落成通车以后，包兰铁路的火车就在桥上越过陇海铁路，两条铁路可以同时交叉通行火车，使运输效率不受影响。
    这座跨线桥采用钢架结构，建成后将和附近的黄河大拱桥遥遥相对。　（新华社）
