Purchasing Sunflower Seeds
Jiang Qiu

Sunflower seeds are a widely used oilseed and also an export commodity. Planting sunflowers is not only technically simple, but also generally does not compete with cotton and grain for land, possessing enormous potential for increased production.

This spring, in addition to the major producing areas such as Northeast and North China continuing to plant sunflowers on a large scale, many areas that did not have the habit of planting sunflowers in the past also actively introduced and trialed planting. According to the planting situation in Henan, Rehe, Qinghai, Gansu and other provinces, the national output of sunflower seeds this year will be significantly higher than last year. In addition, many large and medium-sized cities across the country, including government agencies, organizations, schools, and urban residents, have actively responded to the call to increase oilseed production for the country, utilizing empty spaces near their homes to plant many sunflowers, and the planting volume is also considerable.

Currently, sunflower seeds are already on the market. State-owned oil companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should seize the opportunity to do a good job in purchasing sunflower seeds. Especially this year, the planting plans for major oil crops in some areas have not been completed due to the influence of natural conditions, so vigorously purchasing sunflower seeds to increase the source of edible oil and expand the export volume is even more important.

At present, in addition to actively purchasing sunflower seeds in the main producing areas, the oil companies and supply and marketing cooperative systems should also pay special attention to strengthening the purchasing work in scattered producing areas and cities. Because although the products in these areas are scattered and the product quality is not high, if we pay attention to purchasing bit by bit, accumulating small amounts into large quantities, we can obtain a considerable quantity. If we do not actively purchase because these areas have low output and poor quality, these sunflower seeds will be eaten piecemeal, and this will reduce the production enthusiasm of the masses, which will be very unfavorable to the promotion and expansion of sunflower planting next year. Oil companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should organize all possible forces and adopt methods that facilitate the masses to sell their products, so as to purchase sunflower seeds from major producing areas, minor producing areas, and scattered sunflower seeds in cities.

    收购葵花子
    江秋
    葵花子是一种用途很广的油料，也是一项出口物资；种植向日葵不但技术简单而且一般不同棉粮争地，增产潜力极大。
    今年春季除东北、华北等主要产区仍然大量地种植了向日葵以外，许多过去没有种植向日葵习惯的地区也都积极引种试种。根据河南、热河、青海、甘肃等省种植情况看，今年全国葵花子的产量比去年将有较大的增加。此外，全国许多大、中城市的机关、团体、学校和城市居民也都积极响应为国家增产油料的号召，利用宅旁空地种植了许多向日葵，种植数量也相当可观。
    目前葵花子已经上市，各地国营油脂公司和供销合作社应该抓紧时机做好葵花子的收购工作。特别是今年某些地区的主要油料作物播种计划因自然条件的影响没能完成，大力收购葵花子，以增加食油的来源，并扩大出口数量，就更加显得重要了。
    当前油脂公司和供销合作社系统除了应在葵花子主要产区积极进行收购外，还应该特别注意加强在分散产区和城市的收购工作。因为这些地区虽然产品分散和产品质量不高，但如果注意一点一滴地收购，积少成多，集中起来就会有很大的数量；如果因为这些地区产量少，质量不好，而不去积极收购，这些葵花子就会被零碎地吃掉了，而且会降低群众的生产热情，这对明年推广和扩大向日葵的种植是十分不利的。各地油脂公司、供销合作社应该组织可能的力量和采用便利群众交售的方法，把主要产区、次要产区以及城市零星的葵花子都收购起来。
