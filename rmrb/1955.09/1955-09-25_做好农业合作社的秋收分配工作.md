    Do a Good Job in the Autumn Harvest Distribution of Agricultural Cooperatives

    The autumn harvest season is approaching, and more than 600,000 agricultural cooperatives across the country are preparing for the autumn harvest distribution. This is a major event related to the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperatives, and we must strive to do it well.

    This autumn, a bumper harvest is expected in most parts of the country, and the crops of most agricultural cooperatives are growing better than those of farmers outside the cooperatives. The first question that the millions of cooperative members who joined agricultural cooperatives since last summer and autumn have often considered—whether production can be increased—has been satisfactorily answered. Now, the issue they are focusing on is the distribution issue, whether their own income can be increased. Whether the distribution of the cooperative is fair greatly affects the consolidation and development of the cooperative, the departure or retention of a few members, and the timing of some farmers joining the cooperative. Therefore, fair and reasonable distribution, ensuring that the vast majority of cooperative members increase their income compared to before joining the cooperative, and further strengthening their confidence and determination to take the road of cooperation is an extremely important task.

    A high tide of the cooperative movement is about to appear nationwide. Many farmers are preparing to join the cooperative, and some are considering the timing of their joining. One of the important issues they consider is whether their actual income after joining the cooperative will be more or less than before joining. They pay particular attention to the income distribution of those cooperative members whose production conditions are similar to their own. Therefore, doing a good job in the autumn harvest distribution of existing cooperatives, using vivid facts to educate the thousands of farmers who are preparing to join the cooperative about the superiority of cooperation, making the farmers who have already decided to join more determined, and turning the hesitant farmers into active ones, is a huge driving force for the early arrival of the high tide of the cooperative movement.

    The implementation of the mutual benefit policy is the key to consolidating the cooperative, and the execution of the mutual benefit policy is often concentratedly reflected in the distribution of income. The cooperative is a semi-socialist economic organization voluntarily united by poor and middle peasants, containing both cooperative and private natures. Its income distribution must conform to these two natures to promote its development and progress. That is to say, the income distribution of the cooperative must correctly reflect the principle of mutual benefit between poor and middle peasants and the correct combination of individual and collective interests. Members' land and other means of production contributed to the cooperative must receive reasonable remuneration, and the distribution principle of "labor as the main factor, taking land into account" must be correctly implemented. Last year, some cooperatives did not grasp these principles well in the distribution of income, and there was a tendency to excessively and hastily reduce land remuneration, which reduced the income of some members with more land, affecting the unity and consolidation of the cooperative. Some agricultural cooperatives had too high or too low remuneration for livestock and large farm tools, thus causing harm to the interests of poor peasants or infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. Since the spring of this year, some of these problems have been resolved in the rectification of cooperatives, while some have not yet been resolved; they must be seriously resolved in this year's autumn harvest distribution process. Huanggang County in Hubei Province recently conducted trial calculations for distribution in agricultural cooperatives and corrected the phenomenon of underestimating land productivity in more than 160 cooperatives. As a result, the members who were originally passive and dissatisfied due to the low assessment of productivity became active, the individual members who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative settled down, and the very few members who withdrew from the cooperative due to the low assessment of productivity asked to return to the cooperative. The mutual aid teams that were originally unwilling to transfer to the cooperative because they saw the unfair assessment of productivity are also actively preparing to transfer to the cooperative after the autumn. This experience should be promoted.

    In order to reasonably distribute income, it is also necessary to pay attention to mastering the appropriate proportion between the personal income of members and the public accumulation and public production expenses of the cooperative. It is wrong to overemphasize any one side. Last year, some cooperatives, disregarding the needs of their members, retained too much and distributed too little, blindly spending, which led to the phenomenon of "increased production in the cooperative, reduced production for the members." Some cooperatives did not consider the development of production in the coming year and the growth of socialist factors, distributing all income to individuals, which hindered the development and improvement of the cooperative. When distributing income, cooperatives must pay attention to appropriately handling the issue of members' personal income and collective expenses based on local production conditions and the awareness of members, preventing these two deviations.

    Income distribution is a very heavy task. All cooperatives must conduct socialist and collectivist education for their members through the specific facts of their cooperative, continuously improve the awareness of members, and solve the problem of mutual benefit. Generally speaking, the small-proprietor mentality of middle peasants is more serious, and their persuasion and education work should be further strengthened. But this does not mean that education can be relaxed for poor peasant members. It should be recognized that the autumn harvest distribution process is a process of strengthening political and ideological education for all members. All members should recognize the superiority of cooperation from the increase in production and income, the importance of mutual benefit between middle and poor peasants, the growth of public accumulation of the cooperative as the basis for the long-term interests of the members, and the relationship between the realization of the cooperative's production plan and the country's socialist construction. In short, raising the socialist awareness of the members a step further through the autumn harvest distribution is a major issue that should be resolved in the autumn harvest distribution.

    The old cooperatives in the existing agricultural cooperatives have carried out many distributions and accumulated some experience. The more than 500,000 new cooperatives established since last spring have undergone a universal rectification, and most of them are consolidated. However, at the same time, it should be seen that some new cooperatives have been established and rectified relatively roughly, and many legacy issues, especially issues directly related to distribution, such as land productivity assessment, have not been well resolved; the phenomenon of weak accounting work and chaotic financial management is even more serious. Therefore, through the autumn harvest distribution, conducting a serious inspection and resolution of these issues, and universally rectifying the cooperative, is possible and must be done. At present, many places closely combine the formulation of distribution plans with the work of rectifying and consolidating cooperatives. Through trial calculation and trial distribution, clearing income, expenditure, and labor work accounts, checking and resolving issues related to land productivity assessment, labor calculation, and financial management, they mobilize members to make a final effort to strive for a bumper harvest. This not only ensures fair and reasonable distribution but also improves the degree of consolidation of the cooperative. Huanggang County in Hubei Province has done this, and some district cadres said: "This distribution is equivalent to a year's consolidation work." A few rural workers have simplified the autumn harvest distribution work. They believe that "as long as you clear a few accounts, one distribution is over." "As long as production has increased, isn't it easy to distribute things?" Distribution work guided by this kind of thinking will definitely not be done well. This kind of simple and hasty thinking and practice must be seriously inspected and corrected.

    In order to do a good job in the autumn harvest distribution, it is necessary to organize forces well and make full preparations. Last year, due to insufficient preparation and insufficient attention from the leadership, many problems occurred in the autumn harvest distribution of some cooperatives. For example, some areas did not determine the distribution plan until the autumn harvest was completed; some areas did not clear the labor work accounts before the leadership rushed to the work of unified grain purchase and the establishment and expansion of cooperatives; and some cooperatives' distribution accounts were dragged on until this year and have not been cleared, seriously affecting the consolidation of old cooperatives and the establishment of new cooperatives. This year, rural work is more complex than last year, the work of grain "three fixings" to households is very heavy, and the momentum and scale of the cooperative movement have greatly exceeded last year. If preparations are not made early and properly arranged, various tasks will crowd in after the autumn harvest, which will inevitably cause work to be delayed and passive, which will not only affect the consolidation and development of cooperatives but also affect the progress of other tasks. Therefore, all localities should step up preparations, start early, train accounting personnel, clear up various accounts, improve financial management, and strive to quickly distribute income after the autumn harvest in order to concentrate efforts on leading the cooperative movement and welcome the new high tide of the national rural cooperative movement.

### 做好农业合作社的秋收分配工作

    做好农业合作社的秋收分配工作
    秋收季节即将到来，全国六十多万个农业合作社正在准备进行秋收分配。这是有关巩固和发展农业合作社的一件大事，必须努力把它作好。
    今年秋季全国绝大部分地区可望丰收，多数农业合作社的庄稼长得又比社外农民的好，去年夏秋以来新加入农业合作社的千万户社员所经常考虑的第一个问题，即能否增产的问题，已经得到圆满的回答。现在他们所集中注意的问题，已经是分配问题，是自己能否增加收入的问题了。合作社的分配是否公平，在很大程度上影响社的巩固和发展，少数社员的去留，和某些农民入社时间的迟早。因此，公平合理地进行分配，保证绝大多数社员都比入社以前增加收入，更加坚定他们走合作化道路的信心和决心，就是一件意义极为重大的工作。
    在全国范围内，合作化运动的高潮即将出现。广大农民有的正在张罗入社，有的正在考虑自己入社的时间。他们考虑的重要问题之一，就是入社以后的实际收入究竟比入社以前是多是少。他们特别注意同自己的生产条件相当的那些社员的收入分配情况。因此，作好现有的合作社的秋收分配工作，用生动的事实向千千万万准备入社的农民进行一次合作化优越性的教育，使已经决心入社的农民更加坚定，使还在犹豫的农民转向积极，这对合作化运动高潮的早日到来是一个巨大的推动力量。
    互利政策的贯彻是巩固合作社的关键，而互利政策的执行状况常常在收益分配上集中表现出来。合作社是贫农、中农自愿联合的半社会主义的经济组织，它包含着合作和私有的两种性质，它的收益分配必须符合这两种性质，才能促进它的发展和前进。这就是说，合作社的收益分配必须正确体现贫农和中农互利的原则，体现个人利益和集体利益的正确结合。社员入社的土地和其他生产资料必须取得合理的报酬，“劳动为主、兼顾土地”的分配原则必须正确地加以贯彻。去年有些合作社分配收益没有很好地掌握这些原则，发生了过多过急地降低土地报酬的偏向，使部分土地较多的社员减少了收入，影响到社的团结和巩固。部分农业合作社对牲口、大农具的报酬偏高偏低，因而发生了伤害贫农或侵犯中农利益的现象。今年春季以来各地整顿合作社，这些问题有的已经解决，有些还没有解决；在今年的秋收分配过程中，必须认真加以解决。湖北黄冈县最近在农业合作社进行试算分配，纠正了一百六十多个社土地评产偏低的现象。结果，原来因为评产太低而消极不满的社员积极起来了，个别想退社的社员安定下来了，极少数因为评产太低退了社的社员又重新要求回社了，原来看到评产不公不愿转社的互助组也积极准备秋后转社了。这个经验应该加以推广。
    为了合理地分配收益，还必须注意掌握社员个人所得和社的公共积累、公共生产费用的适当比例。过分强调任何一面都是不对的。去年有些社不顾社员需要，多留少分，盲目开支，以致发生了“社增产、社员减产”的现象。也有些社不考虑来年生产的发展和社会主义因素的增长，把全部收益分给个人，妨碍了合作社的发展和提高。合作社进行收益分配，必须注意根据当地的生产条件和社员的觉悟，适当地处理社员个人所得和集体费用的问题，防止这两种偏差。
    收益分配是一项十分繁重的工作，所有合作社必须通过本社的具体事实，对社员进行社会主义、集体主义的教育，不断提高社员觉悟，解决互利的问题。一般地说，中农的小私有者的心理比较严重，对他们的说服教育工作更应加强。但这绝不是说对贫农社员可以放松教育。应该认识，秋收分配过程就是对全体社员加强政治思想教育的过程。要让所有社员从生产的提高和收入的增加认识合作化的优越性，中农、贫农互利的重要性，社的公共积累的增长是社员长远利益的基础的道理，合作社的生产计划的实现同国家社会主义建设的关系。总之，经过秋收分配把社员的社会主义觉悟提高一步，是秋收分配中应该解决的一大问题。
    现有农业合作社中的老社，已经进行过多次分配，积累了一些经验。去年春季以来新建立的五十多万个新社，经过一次普遍的整顿，绝大部分也是巩固的。但是，同时应该看到，部分新社由于建立和整顿都比较粗糙，不少遗留问题，特别是直接有关分配的问题，如土地评产等等，还没有很好地解决；会计工作薄弱和财务管理混乱的现象更加严重。因此，通过秋收分配，把这些问题进行一次认真的检查和解决，把合作社普遍整顿一次，是可能做到也必须做到的。目前很多地方把制定分配方案和整顿巩固合作社的工作密切结合起来，通过试算试分，清算收入、支出、劳动工账，检查解决有关土地评产、劳动计算、财务管理等方面的问题，发动社员努最后一把力，争取丰产丰收。这样不仅保证了分配的公平合理，同时使社的巩固程度提高一步。湖北黄冈县这样作了，有些区干部说：“这次分配，等于一年的巩固工作。”有少数农村工作人员把秋收分配工作简单化了，他们认为“只要算清几笔账，一分就完了。”“只要增了产，分东西还不好办？”在这种思想指导下进行分配工作，肯定是做不好的。对这种简单草率的思想和作法，必须认真进行检查纠正。
    为了做好秋收分配工作，必须很好地组织力量，进行充分的准备。去年某些合作社的秋收分配，由于准备不足，领导重视不够，曾经发生了不少问题。例如，有些地区直到秋收完毕还没有定出分配方案；有些地区劳动工账没有算清，领导力量就匆忙地转上粮食统购和建社扩社工作上；有些社的分配账拖到今年还没有算清，严重影响到老社的巩固和新社的建立。今年农村工作比去年更为复杂，粮食“三定”到户的工作很繁重，合作化运动的声势规模也大大超过去年。如不及早作好准备，加以妥善安排，秋收以后各种任务拥挤上来，势将造成工作的拖拉、被动，不仅影响合作社的巩固发展，也将影响其他任务的进行。因此，各地应该加紧准备，及早动手，训练会计人员，清理各种账目，改进财务管理，争取在秋收以后能够很快把收益分配清楚，以便集中力量领导合作化运动，迎接全国农村的合作化运动的新高潮。
