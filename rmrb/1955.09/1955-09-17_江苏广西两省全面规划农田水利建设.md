Jiangsu and Guangxi Provinces Comprehensively Plan Farmland Water Conservancy Construction

    This newspaper reports that Jiangsu Province is actively starting with basin-wide planning, based on the principle of combining temporary and permanent solutions, and emphasizing both flood control, drainage, and drought prevention. The province will continue to manage severely damaging rivers and vigorously develop farmland water conservancy to gradually reduce various water and drought disasters, ensuring increased agricultural production.
    According to the plan, while constructing large-scale water conservancy projects, Jiangsu Province will also widely carry out mass farmland water conservancy projects based on different local water conditions and agricultural production increase plans. Therefore, all localities are required to carefully formulate outline plans for the next three years and specific plans for this winter and next spring to ensure that water conservancy construction is carried out with leadership and in a step-by-step manner. The general requirements are: in terms of flood prevention, in areas where water has an outlet, when rainfall reaches 150 to 200 millimeters continuously, accumulated water should be completely drained within three days; in terms of drought resistance, paddy fields should generally be able to resist drought for 50 days, and dry crops should be able to be irrigated twice. Based on this requirement and the province's agricultural production increase plan, from this winter to the end of 1957, the earthwork task for farmland water conservancy projects is roughly stipulated as follows: in the Taihu Lake Basin, Lixiahe area, along the Yangtze River, the mountainous areas of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, and the Xuzhou and Huaiyin areas, a total of approximately 351.87 million cubic meters of earthwork will be done. This winter and next spring, 132 million cubic meters of earthwork will be completed first. After the implementation of this plan, Jiangsu Province will gradually reduce various water and drought disasters. The construction of large-scale projects such as the Sheyang River Sluice will fundamentally improve the farmland water conservancy conditions in the Lixiahe area, and ensure increased grain and cotton production; the completion of other farmland water conservancy projects will also greatly improve irrigation and drainage conditions throughout the province, providing an important guarantee for the agricultural production increase plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, September 13th. Guangxi Province is carrying out comprehensive farmland water conservancy planning work step by step with townships as units. Six counties have now completed preliminary planning, and forty counties are about to complete key surveys.
    The six counties of Cenxi, Guiping, Tianyang, He County, Xing'an, and Wuming, which have completed planning work, have selected the sites for phased construction of water conservancy projects based on local historical data on water and drought disasters, the irrigation capacity of existing water conservancy facilities, and natural water sources. According to the plan, the nine townships of Linlu and Linlang in the Second District of Wuming County will completely eliminate water and drought disasters by 1960. Starting this year, the farmers in these townships will build twelve small-scale water conservancy projects with irrigation areas of less than 1,000 mu and two medium-sized water conservancy projects with irrigation areas of more than 1,000 mu in three batches. The irrigation area is required to reach 96 percent of the total cultivated land area.
    Prior to this, some areas in the province with relatively serious drought and flood conditions had completed comprehensive farmland water conservancy planning first. The first and second batches of irrigation and flood control projects in dozens of townships in these areas have been completed one after another. Ten townships in Fuzhong County have now newly built 21 small-scale water conservancy projects and repaired 45 original water conservancy projects in accordance with the plan. The irrigation area has reached 95 percent of the cultivated land area, and the drought resistance capacity is around 40 days. Due to the elimination of drought disasters, these areas have had very good grain harvests.
    The comprehensive farmland water conservancy planning work in various places is carried out jointly by farmer water conservancy technicians and water conservancy department cadres. The province has trained 13,000 farmer water conservancy technicians, and another 10,000 will be trained recently.

    江苏广西两省全面规划农田水利建设
    本报讯  江苏省积极从流域规划入手，根据治标治本结合、防洪排涝防旱并重的方针，继续治理为害严重的河流，大力兴办农田水利，以逐渐减少各种水旱灾害，保证农业增产。
    根据规划，江苏省在兴修大型水利工程的同时，还要根据各地不同的水利情况和农业增产的计划要求，广泛开展群众性的农田水利工程。因此，要求各地认真制定今后三年的轮廓计划和今冬明春的具体计划，以保证水利建设有领导有步骤地进行。一般要求是：防涝方面，凡水有出路的地区，降雨量连续一百五十公厘至二百公厘时，积水能做到在三天内全部排出；抗旱方面，水稻田一般做到能抗旱五十天，旱作物能灌溉两次。根据这一要求和全省的农业增产计划，从今年冬季起到一九五七年底，农田水利工程土方任务大体规定：太湖流域，里下河地区，沿江地区，镇江、扬州山区和徐州、淮阴地区，共约做土方三亿五千一百八十七万公方。今冬明春将首先完成土方一亿三千二百万公方。这一规划实现后，江苏省将逐步减少各种水旱灾害。射阳河闸等大型工程的兴建，将使里下河地区的农田水利条件基本改善，粮、棉增产得到保障；其他农田水利工程的完成，也将大大改善全省灌溉与排涝条件，使农业增产计划获得重要保障。
    新华社南宁十三日电广西省各地正以乡为单位，有步骤地进行农田水利的全面规划工作。现在有六个县已初步完成了规划，有四十个县即将完成重点勘察。
    已经完成规划工作的岑溪、桂平、田阳、贺县、兴安、武鸣六县，根据当地历年水旱灾害的资料、现有水利设备的灌溉能力和天然水源，已选择了分期兴建水利工程的地址。武鸣县第二区林渌、琳琅等九个乡根据规划，将在一九六零年前全部消灭水旱灾害。这几个乡的农民从今年开始，将分三批兴建灌溉千亩以下的小型水利工程十二处，千亩以上的中型水利工程两处，灌溉面积要求达到总耕地面积百分之九十六。
    在此以前，省内有一部分旱涝比较严重的地区，已先完成农田水利全面规划。这些地区几十个乡的第一、第二批灌溉、防洪工程已先后完工。富钟县有十个乡现已按照规划新建小型水利工程二十一处，补修原有水利工程四十五处，灌溉面积已达耕地面积百分之九十五，抗旱能力都在四十天左右。由于消灭了旱灾，这些地区的粮食收成都很好。
    各地农田水利全面规划工作，是由农民水利技术员和水利部门干部协同进行的。全省已训练了一万三千名农民水利技术员，最近要再训练一万名。
