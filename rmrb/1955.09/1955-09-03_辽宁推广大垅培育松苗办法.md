    Liaoning Province's Forestry Bureau, based on the experience of trial ridge cultivation of two-year-old pine seedlings (Larch, Black Pine, Oriental Arborvitae, Korean Pine) in Gaiping, Beizhen, and other places in 1954, has promoted ridge cultivation on over 900 mu of land in more than 90 state-owned nurseries throughout the province this year.
    Using ridge cultivation for two-year-old pine seedlings can produce 19,000 more seedlings per mu than using seedbeds in the past. It can also reduce the investment per mu by two-thirds or more, saving the state more than 170,000 yuan. Because ridge cultivation provides good ventilation and sunlight, resists drought and waterlogging, and facilitates weeding and cultivation, the seedlings grow vigorously and are of good quality.

    辽宁推广大垅培育松苗办法
    辽宁省林业局根据一九五四年盖平、北镇等地试行大垅培育二年生松苗（落叶松、黑松、侧柏、果松）的经验，今年在全省九十多个国营苗圃中推广大垅育苗九百多亩。
    用大垅培育二年生松苗比过去用苗床作培育每亩地能多产一万九千棵苗木；并能减少每亩投资三分之二以上，共为国家节省资金十七万多元。由于垅作通风，日照良好，抗旱抗涝，便利除草中耕，苗木生育茁壮，质量良好。
