Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 31st (TASS dispatch): The Soviet "North Pole-4" and "North Pole-5" drifting scientific stations are currently continuing interesting scientific research work in the center of the Arctic zone.

    Since a new group of scientists from the "North Pole-4" scientific drifting station boarded the ice floe where the station is located in April of this year, the ice has drifted more than 780 kilometers. The scientists at this drifting station are now working in an almost unexplored area in the central Arctic Ocean. In the deepest part of the Arctic Ocean, whether in the water between ice floes or under the ice floes, more seaweed and plankton than elsewhere can be found, and fish also appear more frequently. The heavy-duty winch used in deep water collected samples of silt and sand, as well as samples of various stones and rock fragments, from the bottom of the Arctic Ocean for the first time in this latitude zone. These samples can be used to better determine the geological history of the bottom of the Arctic Ocean and the original place of formation of the ice floes.

    The speed at which the ice floe where the "North Pole-5" drifting scientific station is located has been drifting north has slowed down slightly since the end of June. The great storms in the central Arctic have intensified, and the wind direction has also changed frequently, so the drift route has become more tortuous. In four months, the total voyage of the drift was more than 750 kilometers, while the total northward navigation of the ice floe was only about 300 kilometers away from its original starting point.

    Over the past four months, the staff of the "North Pole-5" scientific drifting station has made many measurements of the depth of the seabed, and the results show that the eastern slope of the Lomonosov submarine mountain range has many branches more than one kilometer high and hundreds of kilometers long. While studying the undulations of the seabed, seabed mud was continuously collected and seabed organisms were captured. At present, they are still continuing to observe the external shape of the ice floes, the tidal flow direction of the sea water, and the physical and chemical conditions of the sea water.

    北极地带苏联两个漂流科学站研究工作继续进展
    新华社三十一日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“北极—四号”、“北极—五号”等漂流科学站目前继续在北极地带的中心进行有趣的科学研究工作。
    “北极—四号”科学漂流站的一批新的科学家从今年四月登上漂流站所在的这块冰块以后，这块冰已经漂流了七百八十多公里。这个漂流站的科学家现在已经深入到北冰洋中部几乎未经考察的地区进行工作。在北冰洋的最深处，不论是在冰块之间的水中或是在冰块下面，都能发现水草和比别处多的浮游生物，鱼出现的时候也更多了。在深水中使用的重型卷扬机在这一带纬道上第一次从北冰洋底收集了淤泥和沙粒的样品，以及各种石头和各种岩石碎片的样品。根据这些样品可以更好地判断出北冰洋底的地质史，冰块的最初的形成地方。
    “北极—五号”漂流科学站所在的冰块从六月底开始向北漂流的速度已稍许缓慢了些。北极中心大风暴加剧了，同时风向也经常改变，因此漂流路线就曲折得更加厉害。四个月当中，漂流的总航程为七百五十多公里，而冰块沿向北方的总方航行面仅离开原来的出发点约三百公里。
    四个月来，“北极—五号”科学漂流站的工作人员对海底深度作了许多次测量，结果证明：洛蒙诺索夫海底山脉东面山坡有着许多高一公里以上长几百公里的支脉。在研究海底起伏情况时，不断收集海底泥土和捕捉海底生物。目前，他们还在继续观测冰块的外状、海水的潮流方向和海水的物理化学状况。
