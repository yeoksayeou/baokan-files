An important measure in the modernization and regularization of China's armed forces
    In order to build a strong and modern national defense force, to safeguard the security and independence of our motherland, and to safeguard the great socialist cause, China's military system has been changed from a voluntary military service system to a compulsory military service system. Regarding the service of officers of the People's Liberation Army, and the establishment of a regular state reward system for soldiers, the Regulations on the Service of Officers of the People's Liberation Army and the Regulations on Awarding Medals and Medals to Personnel of the People's Liberation Army Who Made Meritorious Service During the Chinese People's Revolutionary War, promulgated in February this year, have made principled provisions. The 22nd meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a resolution, and Chairman Mao Zedong issued an order to confer the military rank of Marshal of the People's Republic of China on Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Chen Yi, Luo Ronghuan, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, and Ye Jianying for their outstanding contributions to the creation and leadership of the people's armed forces or in leading the battle group operations. At the same time, in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations on the Service of Officers, the state conferred military ranks on officers of various services and arms of the People's Liberation Army, and wore military rank epaulettes and symbols and dressed in accordance with the new uniform style prescribed by the state from October 1, 1955. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress also approved the list of the first batch of personnel who should be awarded the First Class August 1st Medal, the First Class Independence and Freedom Medal, and the First Class Liberation Medal, including those who led the uprising of the original Kuomintang army during the People's Liberation War and made significant contributions to the People's Liberation War, as well as those who made significant contributions to the peaceful liberation of Tibet. This is what all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country have eagerly anticipated and unanimously supported.
    Now Chairman Mao Zedong has conferred the military rank of Marshal of the People's Republic of China on Zhu De, Peng Dehuai and other ten generals of the People's Liberation Army who are loved by the Chinese military and civilians. Premier Zhou Enlai has conferred the military ranks of Grand General, General, Lieutenant General, and Major General on leaders at all levels of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Other officers and soldiers will also receive military ranks, medals and awards in batches. Here, we would like to extend our warm congratulations to the officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who have received ranks and all the recipients of medals and awards.
    Awarding state medals and awards to personnel who made meritorious service during the Chinese People's Revolutionary War is a lofty honor given to their heroic sons and daughters by our great motherland and the people of the motherland, which represents the deep gratitude of the state and the people to these heroic sons and daughters. Since its founding, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the direct leadership of the Communist Party of China, has fought bravely with the powerful enemies at home and abroad with unswerving revolutionary will and great spirit of self-sacrifice, together with the people of the whole country. For the victory of the people, they endured unimaginable hardships, and even paid with blood and life; finally, with the support of the people of the whole country, they defeated the Kuomintang reactionary army and won the great victory of the people's revolution. The fact that the Chinese people can start the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation today is inseparable from their heroic struggle. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate for the state to award them medals and awards. During the Liberation War, many former Kuomintang officers and soldiers with patriotism and a sense of justice, some raised the banner of righteousness on the battlefield and joined the people's side, and some announced their departure from Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule and allegiance to the people's democratic regime. They all made contributions to the great People's Liberation War. Some officials of the Tibetan local government also made important contributions to the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Therefore, it is also entirely appropriate to award them medals and awards.
    Why is it necessary to implement the military rank system in the People's Liberation Army now? This is because with the implementation of the compulsory military service system, the modernization of equipment requires that the training and actions of the troops must strictly comply with the regular system and regulations, the status and interrelationships of officers among soldiers must be clearly stipulated, and the organization and discipline of the troops must be further improved. The implementation of the military rank system will facilitate the strengthening of the organization and discipline of the troops in order to carry out military tasks. In the long domestic revolutionary war, the People's Liberation Army established strict discipline and formed the fine tradition of superiors caring for subordinates and subordinates obeying superiors. However, at that time, due to the decentralized operations of the troops, simple equipment, few arms of service, and the fact that they were composed of volunteers, it was easy for officers and soldiers to get along for a long time and recognize each other. At that time, we did not have a unified national regime to issue and confer military ranks, so it was entirely correct not to implement the military rank system at that time. The situation is different now. The national people's regime has long been established, the compulsory military service system has begun to be implemented, and the organization and equipment of the People's Liberation Army are also very different from the past, so it is necessary and also has the conditions to implement the military rank system. The state's conferring of military ranks on officers is an honor given to officers at all levels by the state, and at the same time, it is a major political responsibility given to officers at all levels by the state. Officers exercising their powers in accordance with the regulations is also what the state and the people require of them. Therefore, officers at all levels must guard against arrogance and rashness, work diligently, and complete the glorious tasks given by the state and the people. According to the provisions of the Regulations on the Service of Officers, officers must wear epaulettes and symbols corresponding to their military ranks, so that there are clear identification marks between officers and soldiers, between officers at all levels, and between various services and arms. This makes it possible to conduct command and work at any time and any place in accordance with a strict military organization and order, with clear responsibilities. Only in this way can the army, under the new conditions and new requirements of complex equipment, rapid movement, and coordinated operations of modern arms of service, successfully carry out military tasks and defend the motherland in accordance with rapidly changing situations.
    After the implementation of the military rank system, there are clear distinctions between officers and soldiers and between officers at all levels. Will this affect the close unity between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates? No. The military rank system of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is essentially different from the military rank system of the old army. In old China and all capitalist countries, the army is a tool for maintaining reactionary rule and oppressing the people, and there are also sharp contradictions between officers and soldiers in the army. Officers are the oppressors of soldiers, so they cannot have close unity, and the people hate the reactionary army. But the People's Liberation Army is completely different. The People's Liberation Army is a tool to defend the motherland, resist aggression, suppress counter-revolutionary forces, consolidate the people's regime, and safeguard the interests of the people; there is no opposition of class interests between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates of the People's Liberation Army, but they are completely consistent. Both officers and soldiers are fighting together to defend the motherland and the interests of the people, and to defend socialist construction. Therefore, the military rank of officers of the People's Liberation Army does not mean that officers can oppress soldiers or that superiors can oppress subordinates. On the contrary, it means that officers have greater responsibilities, they must better care for and cherish their subordinates and soldiers, and better unite their subordinates and soldiers to jointly complete the tasks assigned to them by the motherland and the people. Therefore, the implementation of the military rank system is to continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between superiors and subordinates, and unity between the military and the people of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the basis of better organization and discipline, and should not and will not affect this unity in the slightest.
    The implementation of the military rank system can also guarantee the quality required of officers by the national defense cause. A modern revolutionary army not only requires officers to be loyal to their motherland and people, and to show a high degree of courage and determination in battle, but also must have military scientific knowledge and the ability to master modern military technology, and must have the physical conditions commensurate with their positions in order to be competent. The state's conferring of military ranks on officers is determined by their current positions, political qualities, professional abilities, experience in serving in the army, and contributions to the revolutionary cause. This guarantees the quality required of officers for the modernization of national defense. In order to encourage officers to continue to improve themselves and adapt to the growing needs of the modernization of the army for the quality of officers, the Regulations on the Service of Officers also stipulate the time limit for the promotion of officers' military ranks and the conditions for early promotion. These provisions will become a positive force to urge officers to work hard, improve themselves, and strive to defend the motherland.
    The long-tested Chinese People's Liberation Army is the loyal defender of the interests of the Chinese people and national security. The implementation of the Regulations on the Service of Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the state's regular reward system for soldiers will encourage all soldiers and officers to carry forward the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism to a greater extent, to play a greater role in the modernization and regularization of the People's Liberation Army with a high degree of initiative and creativity, and to play a greater role in liberating Taiwan, completing the great cause of national reunification, and defending the motherland and resisting imperialist aggression.

    我国武装力量现代化正规化建设中的重要措施
    为了建设强大的现代化的国防力量，保卫我们祖国的安全和独立，保卫伟大的社会主义事业，我国的军事制度已经由志愿兵制改变为义务兵役制。关于人民解放军军官服役方面的问题，以及建立国家对军人的正规奖励制度的问题，今年二月间公布的人民解放军军官服役条例和授予人民解放军在中国人民革命战争时期有功人员以勋章奖章的条例已做了原则的规定，全国人民代表大会常务委员会第二十二次会议通过决议，并由毛泽东主席发布命令，授予对创造和领导人民武装力量或在领导战役军团作战中立有卓越功勋的朱德、彭德怀、林彪、刘伯承、贺龙、陈毅、罗荣桓、徐向前、聂荣臻、叶剑英以中华人民共和国元帅军衔。同时，国家根据军官服役条例的规定，分别授予人民解放军各军种、兵种军官以军衔，并于一九五五年十月一日起佩带军衔肩章、符号，按照国家规定的新的服装制式着装。全国人民代表大会常务委员会还通过了应分别授予一级八一勋章、一级独立自由勋章和一级解放勋章的第一批人员的名单，包括在人民解放战争中领导原国民党军队起义有功，对人民解放战争有重大贡献以及对和平解放西藏有重大贡献的人员。这是我国人民解放军全体官兵和全国人民所热切期望和一致拥护的。
    现在毛泽东主席已经授予我国军民所热爱的人民解放军的高级领导人员朱德、彭德怀等十位将领以中华人民共和国元帅的军衔，周恩来总理已经授予中国人民解放军各级领导人员以大将、上将、中将、少将等军衔，其他官兵也将分批接受军衔和勋章奖章。在这里，我们谨向受衔的中国人民解放军军官和所有的受勋受奖人员表示热烈的祝贺。
    授予中国人民革命战争时期有功人员以国家的勋章和奖章，这是我们伟大的祖国和祖国人民给予自己的英雄儿女们的崇高荣誉，这代表着国家和人民对于这些英雄儿女们的深切感谢。我国人民解放军从建军以来，就在中国共产党的直接领导下，和全国人民在一起，以百折不回的革命意志和伟大的自我牺牲精神，同强大的国内外敌人英勇作战。为了人民的胜利，他们忍受了人们难以想像的艰难困苦，甚至付出了鲜血和生命；最后终于在全国人民的支持下，击败了国民党反革命军队，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。我国人民今天能够开始社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，是同他们的英勇斗争分不开的。因此，国家授予他们以勋章奖章是完全应当的。在解放战争期间，有许多具有爱国心和正义感的原国民党官兵，有的在战场上高举义旗投到人民方面，有的宣布了脱离蒋介石的反动统治、效忠于人民民主政权，他们对于伟大的人民解放战争都是有功绩的。西藏地方政府的一些官员，对于和平解放西藏也曾作了重要贡献。因此，授予他们以勋章奖章也是完全应当的。
    为什么现在要在人民解放军中实行军衔制度呢？这是因为随着义务兵役制的实行，部队现代化的装备要求部队的训练和行动都必须严格遵照正规的制度和条例，军官在军人中间的地位和相互关系也必须明确规定，部队的组织性和纪律性必须进一步提高，实行军衔制度将更便于加强部队的组织性和纪律性，以遂行军事任务。在长期的国内革命战争中，人民解放军曾经建立了严明的纪律，形成了上级爱护下级，下级服从上级的优良传统。但在那个时期，由于部队分散作战，装备简单，兵种不多，并且是由志愿兵组成的，官兵长期相处，互相识别容易，当时我们又没有全国统一的政权来颁发和授予军衔，所以在那个时期不实行军衔制是完全正确的。现在的情况不同了，全国的人民政权早已建立，义务兵役制已开始推行，人民解放军的编制和装备也同过去大不相同了，所以就必须实行而且也有条件实行军衔制了。国家授予军官以军衔，是国家给予各级军官的荣誉，同时是国家给予各级军官重大的政治责任。军官按照条令施行职权，也是国家和人民对他们的要求。因此，各级军官必须戒骄戒躁，兢兢业业，完成国家和人民给予的光荣任务。根据军官服役条例的规定，军官必须佩带和军衔相符的肩章符号，以便在官兵之间，各级军官之间，各军种兵种之间，有着显明的识别标志。这就能够随时随地按照严密的军事组织和秩序，职责分明地进行指挥和工作。只有这样，军队才能在装备复杂、运动快速和现代化诸兵种协同动作的新条件和新要求之下，依据迅速变化着的情况，胜利地执行军事任务，保卫祖国。
    实行军衔制以后，官和兵之间以及各级军官之间都有了显明的区别标志，这是不是会影响官兵之间和上下级之间的亲密团结呢？不会的。我国人民解放军的军衔制同旧军队的军衔制有着本质的不同。在旧中国和一切资本主义国家，军队是维护反动统治和压迫人民的工具，军队中官兵之间也存在着尖锐的矛盾，军官是士兵的压迫者，所以他们就不可能有亲密的团结，人民对于反动军队是憎恨的。但是人民解放军就完全不同了。人民解放军是保卫祖国、抵抗侵略和镇压反革命势力、巩固人民政权的工具，也是保卫人民利益的工具；人民解放军官兵之间和上下级之间没有阶级利益的对立，而是完全一致的，无论军官和士兵都是为保卫祖国和人民利益，保卫社会主义建设而共同奋斗的。所以人民解放军军官的军衔决不是意味着军官可以压迫士兵，上级可以压迫下级。相反的，它是意味着军官有了更重大的责任，他们必须更好地关心和爱护自己的下级和士兵，更好地团结下级和士兵，共同完成祖国和人民交给自己的任务。所以，实行军衔制就是要在更好的组织性和纪律性的基础上，继续发扬我国人民解放军官兵团结、上下团结和军民团结的光荣传统，而决不会也不应该丝毫影响这种团结。
    实行军衔制度，还可以保证我国国防事业对于军官所要求的质量。现代化的革命军队不仅要求军官要忠实于自己的祖国和人民，在战斗中表现高度的勇敢和坚定，而且必须具有军事科学知识和掌握现代化军事技术的能力，并必须具有同职务相适应的身体条件，才能胜任。国家授予军官军衔，就是以他们的现任职务，政治品质，业务能力，在军队中服务的经历和对革命事业的贡献等条件来决定的。这就保证了国防现代化建设对军官所要求的质量。为了鼓励军官不断上进，以适应现代化军队对军官质量要求日益增长的需要，军官服役条例还规定了军官军衔晋级的年限和提前晋级的条件。这些规定，将成为督促军官努力上进，提高自己，为保卫祖国而奋斗的积极力量。
    久经考验的中国人民解放军是我国人民利益和国家安全的忠实捍卫者。中国人民解放军军官服役条例和国家对军人正规奖励制度的实施，将鼓舞全体军人和军官更高度地发扬爱国主义和革命英雄主义精神，以高度的积极性和创造性在人民解放军的现代化正规化建设中发挥更大的作用，在解放台湾，完成祖国统一大业和保卫祖国、防御帝国主义侵略的斗争中发挥更大的作用。
