    An Electrified Grain-drying Ground
    Chen Yonglu
    When the No. 4 Branch of the State-Run Friendship Farm was harvesting spring wheat, I visited an electrified grain-drying ground. It was equipped with modern machinery donated by the Soviet Union to our country, and the installation of electrical equipment and the adjustment of new machinery were personally supervised by Soviet experts on site.
    In this grain-drying ground, the automatic grain unloading truck used its sensitive and powerful long arm to prop up the wheat-filled truck box (with a capacity of about two to three thousand kilograms), which could be quickly unloaded to the designated place in a dozen seconds, shortening the time to unload a truckload of grain by about seven minutes compared to ordinary trucks. The electrified grain loader (or grain tipping machine) swallowed a large amount of wheat grains with its rotating long tongue, and spat them out from the top of the elevator and threw them into the distance. This machine can be used for both loading and unloading, and it only takes more than twenty minutes to load a truck full of grain. When unloading, it can unload more than 7,000 kilograms of wheat per hour, which is equivalent to the physical labor of more than 40 people.
    On this grain-drying ground, one can also see an excellent new type of machinery - an electrified grain winnowing machine, which uses its very clever winch to throw out wheat at a great speed, so that the heavier, complete wheat grains fall eight to ten meters away, and the lighter, incomplete wheat grains fall closer. The side air flow can remove impurities in the wheat, such as chaff, chopped straw and grass seeds. At the same time, it can also reduce the humidity of the seeds by about 0.5%. In this way, good and bad seeds and impurities are clearly separated. The efficiency of this machine is 10,000 to 11,000 kilograms of grain per hour. One can also see grain cleaning machines and grain dryers powered by electricity. The seed selection machine can select seven or eight different grades of seeds.
    The various machines on the electrified grain-drying ground not only replace the tense and heavy physical labor of dozens of people, but also greatly reduce the area of the grain-drying ground and improve the drying quality of the wheat. With such an electrified grain-drying ground, whether it is day or night, or windy and rainy, the tasks will be completed smoothly according to the established plan, without being restricted by the natural climate.

    一座电气化的晒麦场
    陈永禄
    在国营友谊农场第四分场收获春小麦的时候，我参观了一座电气化的晒麦场。这是以苏联赠送我国的现代化机械装备起来的，电气设备的安装和新式机械的使用调整，也都是苏联专家在现场亲自指导进行的。
    在这座晒麦场里，自动式的卸粮汽车用它那灵敏有力的长臂支起了盛满麦子的车箱（容量约二千至三千公斤），在十几秒钟内就可迅速地卸到所指定的地方，比一般载重汽车卸一车粮可缩短七分钟左右。电气化的谷物装运机（或称倒粮机）以它那回转的长舌吞进大量麦粒，又从升运器顶端吐出抛向远方。这种机械可供装车和倒粮两用，装满一汽车粮食只要二十多分钟时间。倒粮时每小时可倒出七千多公斤小麦，相当于四十多人的体力劳动。
    在这座晒麦场上，还可看到一种出色的新式机械——电气化的扬粮机，用它那很灵巧的卷扬器以很大的速度把麦子抛出，使较重的完整麦粒落到八至十公尺以外，较轻的不完整麦粒就落得近一些。侧面的风流则可清除麦子中的夹杂物，如谷糠、切碎的藁草和草籽等。同时也能将种籽的湿度降低百分之零点五左右。这样便将好、坏种籽和夹杂物等很显明地分开了。这种机械的效率一小时可扬粮一万到一万一千公斤。还可看到用电力带动的谷物精选机、谷物干燥机等机械。选种机能选出七、八种不同等级的种籽。
    电气化晒麦场上的各种机械，不仅代替了数十人的紧张而繁重的体力劳动，还大大地减少了晒麦场的面积，提高麦子的干晒质量。有了这样电气化的晒麦场，无论白天黑夜或是刮风降雨，都会按照已订计划顺利地完成任务，不受自然气候的限制。
