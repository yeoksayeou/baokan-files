　　Publish More Books for Children and Young People
　　Li Geng
　　Recently, the serious situation of insufficient supply of reading materials for children and young people has attracted great attention from the Party and the government, and relevant departments are required to seriously treat this problem, quickly improve their work, and create, publish, and distribute a large number of reading materials for children and young people. Of course, saying that there is a lack of reading materials for children and young people is not a comparison with the pre-liberation era. According to estimates by several veteran publishing workers with more than 20 years of history, in the ten years before the Anti-Japanese War, the five major bookstores that published children's books, such as Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, Beixin Bookstore, and Children's Bookstore, published no more than 2,000 kinds of reading materials for children and young people, with an average print run of only about 3,000 to 4,000 copies per title. However, after the founding of New China, from 1950 to 1954/55, about 2,800 new children's books were published (excluding comic strips), with a circulation of about 57 million copies.
　　The problem is not here. The problem is that compared with the massive needs of today's reality, and compared with the rapid development of our country, the publication of reading materials for children and young people currently appears to be far behind. — Of the 120 million children and young people, 70 million are now literate, but last year only one book (excluding comic strips) could be obtained for every five people, and only one new first edition book could be obtained for every seventeen people; there are more than 500,000 primary schools in the country, but last year the average print run of each type of reading material for children and young people was only more than 10,000 copies; in Shanghai, there are 50,000 visits per day by children and young people to old bookstores that rent out reactionary, obscene, and absurd books, and we do not yet have enough new books to completely occupy this position overflowing with toxic currents. These two or three figures alone are enough to illustrate that the variety and print run of reading materials for children and young people are really too small now.
　　But the above is only a general statement of the lack of reading materials for children and young people. Taking a closer look, the problem becomes even more serious. First of all, the children's books we publish now are generally aimed at urban children and young people, and there is a particular lack of books suitable for reading by the largest number of rural children and young people. According to statistics from Hebei Province, there is an average of one book for every 1,100 people. Secondly, there is an extreme shortage of reading materials for children and young people of ethnic minorities, with only the Nationalities Publishing House publishing some, and very few published by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang People's Publishing House. Thirdly, the younger the children, the less they have to read. We publish very few books for children in lower grades, and reading materials for pre-school children are almost non-existent. Last year, the Children's and Young People's Publishing House only published 30 new picture stories and picture books for young children. Adding the 35 children's comic strips from the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, it is still pitifully small. The aspects are also not complete enough. For example, books on fine arts, music, and games, which children and young people need very much, are simply hard to find in bookstores. There are few literary books being created. In recent years, the number of types published each year has generally only reached about half or less of similar translated books. Works reflecting realistic struggles and national construction are very rare, and revolutionary historical stories and biographies of heroic figures are even rarer. In terms of quality, there are too few good books. General knowledge books in various subjects are generally written in a boring and dull manner. On the bookshelves of children's libraries, they often maintain the appearance of new books for a long time, and no young readers go to read them old and torn.
　　Faced with these facts, publishing workers across the country should now consider how to fundamentally change this situation in the shortest possible time.
　　To publish a large number of reading materials for children and young people, great efforts are needed from all relevant departments. In terms of publishing work, it is very important to find ways to strengthen the editorial power of existing publishing institutions for children and young people, to establish new specialized publishing houses, to set up editorial staff or institutions for reading materials for children and young people in people's publishing houses in provinces and cities with the conditions, and to require some central-level publishing houses to increase the proportion of reading materials for children and young people in their publishing plans, etc.
　　The topic selection plan is the foundation of publishing work. Every publishing house that publishes reading materials for children and young people must first formulate a topic selection plan for next year or a longer period. The Children's and Young People's Publishing House already has a three-year topic selection plan from 1955 to 1957. This plan needs to be widely solicited for opinions and re-examined and revised by relevant leading departments based on today's requirements. Appropriate provisions should be made for the proportion of reading materials of various levels for different ages, the proportion of literature and knowledge reading materials in various subjects, the aspects that should be focused on for development first, and the important topics that must be realized, and the indicators of topic selection should be expanded.
　　However, judging from the situation of past publishing work of reading materials for children and young people, the more important thing is to unite and cultivate writers and do a good job in organizing manuscripts. Without writers, there would be no manuscripts. Creation is the prerequisite for publication. Here, the writer is the main body. But the publishing house is the bridge from the writer to the reader, the institution that controls the national publishing material power, and the actual executor of the national publishing plan. Although the manuscript is written by the writer, it is centrally processed by the publishing house before it meets the reader. Therefore, in promoting the development of creation, the attitude of the publishing house towards writers and how well the organizational work is done are of great significance. Many authors now reflect that they often hear calls for them to write reading materials for children and young people, but they rarely see the footprints of publishing house editors at their doors. This situation must be changed. The publishing house, especially the Children's and Young People's Publishing House, urgently needs to launch a solicitation of manuscripts from authors across the country in the near future, and widely sign contracts with literary writers, scientists, artists, translators, educators, and children and young people workers to write at least one book for children and young people within one or two years. By next year, there should be more than a thousand such contracts to ensure that the indicators of publishing varieties increase rapidly. As mentioned above, the target of manuscript organization must be very broad, not limited to big cities, and even less limited to authors who have written reading materials for children and young people. Because in our China, not only are there very few professional writers, but even few amateur authors have written for children and young people. The only way out is to mobilize everyone to write. Also, because the situation is like this, the publishing house must never just "sign contracts" with authors. The publishing house must patiently help them write, reflect the situation of children and young people readers to them, help them get in touch with children and young people readers, and carefully review their manuscripts. Only in this way can authors who are relatively unfamiliar with children and young people smoothly write manuscripts suitable for them to read.
　　It is particularly important to emphasize the cultivation of new forces. In recent years, a group of new authors of reading materials for children and young people have emerged. The publications of the China Youth Publishing House and the Children's and Young People's Publishing House often see the names of newcomers. From the establishment of "Children's Literature and Art" in July 1953 to the end of 1954, at least 5,000 authors submitted articles. Except for about two-thirds or more of middle school students with generally lower writing levels, there are also 1,000 to 2,000 people who are newspaper reporters, publishing house editors, primary and secondary school teachers, military and government cadres, college students, and a few workers. Among them, about 140 people whose works are well written are in frequent contact with "Children's Literature and Art". Other newspapers and periodicals for children and young people also have their own batch of new authors who they have discovered, cultivated, and contacted. Although most of these people are beginners in writing and are not at a high level, we must cultivate new authors and establish new teams from here, and give special help to authors with potential and willingness to work hard, and do our best to support their growth. This work was done very poorly in the past. Many new authors of the China Youth Publishing House and the Children's and Young People's Publishing House have disappeared after publishing one book, and this phenomenon must be eliminated. The editorial staff of the publishing house must recognize that this is a work of fundamental significance to the development prospects of the future publishing industry of reading materials for children and young people.
　　When expanding the translation force, we should also pay attention to some writers and painters of reading materials for children and young people left over from the old publishing industry. There are a considerable number of such people in large cities such as Shanghai, and some of them are quite proficient in business and skilled. In the process of the socialist transformation of private bookstores, state-owned publishing houses should pay attention to organizing the useful people among them, and those who have been decentralized and transferred to other industries can also find ways to re-centralize them. They should be given education, given topics and plans, and led to carry out some writing and drawing work.
　　Now, it is often difficult to find a place to publish children's literary works of more than 5,000 to 6,000 words, which is very detrimental to the development of creation. Therefore, the editorial strength and leadership of "Children's Literature and Art" must be strengthened, and consideration should be given to increasing the length and improving the content, so that more works can have a garden where they can be published regularly.
　　In addition to vigorously organizing new creations, publishing houses should also find ways to expand the scope of reading materials for children and young people that can be published. For example, in terms of literary reading materials, some works are not specifically written for children and young people but are also suitable for children and young people to read. Chinese literary works such as "Heroes of Lüliang" can be printed in separate volumes with more illustrations for children. It is also possible to compile and select collections of works specifically for children to read by famous Chinese writers, including Lu Xun, and famous foreign writers. It is possible to compile and select Chinese folk tales and myths, and publish translated versions of old Chinese fables, stories, and abridged and rewritten versions of classical novels in modern language. The scope of translation can also be expanded. In addition to reading materials for children and young people in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, classical children's literature and contemporary progressive works in other countries should also be selected and translated in a planned way. Andersen's fairy tales have not yet been published in a children's version, and there are no new translations for children of Grimm's Fairy Tales, Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels, The Story of Reynard the Fox, etc. Science fiction and adventure novels are also an unexplored field. This shows that there are many aspects that can be expanded.
　　Faced with such a major task, the comrades who do publishing work are most worried about the lack of editorial power, because even now, the Children's and Young People's Publishing House alone has more than 2,000 manuscripts every year, which it often cannot handle. This is certainly a difficulty. But it must also be understood that at no time can a publishing house have a large number of editorial staff that is always directly proportional to the increase in publications. The meaning of the phrase "running a publishing house well must rely on the masses" includes relying on social forces in editorial work in addition to relying on writers and readers. Now, some publishing houses' use of social forces is still limited to proofreading translated manuscripts and reviewing specialized manuscripts. In fact, the scope of using social forces in editorial work is very broad. The initial review, review, processing, and verification of various manuscripts, as well as illustrations and cover design, can all be assigned to people outside the publishing house. Publishing houses should change the practice of doing everything themselves but not being able to do much, and put a large part of their efforts into organizational work. In order to quickly increase reading materials for children and young people, the first thing is that specialized publishing houses must unite a group of fixed social forces around themselves. This is difficult, but it is the most practical solution. The Writers Association, newspaper and magazine editorial departments, cultural and educational institutions, and academic research groups should also give strong support in this regard.
　　By doing a good job in uniting and cultivating writers, widely organizing manuscripts, and using social forces in editorial work, we will not find it difficult to greatly increase the number of publications of reading materials for children and young people on the basis of the existing publishing power. At the present time, when we are focusing on solving the quantity problem, publishing workers have no reason to ignore quality. In this regard, we must ensure that publications have a certain ideological and artistic level, but at the same time, we must proceed from reality and gradually improve quality. Quality is to be improved from the development of quantity. Therefore, we must especially cherish every creation and do our best to help it become a usable manuscript after revision.
　　Although the current pricing of reading materials for children and young people has been reduced by 22% in March this year, which is the same as that of general popular reading materials, it is still 11.6% higher per impression than popular editions of literary works and 36.7% higher per impression than textbooks for spare-time schools, which is not compatible with the purchasing power of child readers, especially rural children. Therefore, with the assistance of relevant government departments, publishing houses must also strive to improve business management, implement savings, and reduce waste in order to further reduce prices. Some people emphasize the printing quality of children's books without considering the price, which is wrong. But we cannot only care about the low price without asking about the quality. We still require a higher printing quality for general reading materials for children and young people, and we also need some particularly exquisite publications, which cannot be changed. Therefore, publishing houses can only solve this problem by adopting a careful calculation and trying to lower profits as much as possible. At the same time, we can also consider printing two versions of several types of books, and distributing the popular version to rural areas in large quantities at the lowest price.
　　The publishing sector can never complete this major task alone. From the perspective of publishing workers, the first thing we urgently require is that the Chinese Writers Association strengthen its leadership in children's literature creation and solve many ideological problems that urgently need to be solved in creation. Gradually establish a professional team and directly give amateur children's literature workers writing assistance. The second is the strong support of artists. We must advocate that everyone start working on illustrations and decorations for reading materials for children and young people in order to improve the quality of future publications. The third is that the education department calls on and supports the vast number of primary and secondary school teachers to engage in writing reading materials for children and young people in their spare time. Because the teacher's team is a fertile ground that can grow countless authors of reading materials for children and young people. The fourth is the improvement of distribution work. Bookstores can jointly formulate plans with publishing houses and select 10 to 20 new books each year according to different targets for key and large-scale promotion. We hope that newspapers and periodicals will criticize and introduce new books more often, and we also hope that the Higher Education Department will consider adding children's literature groups or graduate students in the literature departments of several normal universities or comprehensive universities to make long-term plans for cultivating professional cadres.
　　As long as relevant departments pay attention to it and work together, the current situation of lack of reading materials for children and young people can be quickly changed. Under the leadership of the Party, publishing workers also have full confidence in doing their part of the work well.

    给少年儿童出版更多的书
    李庚
    最近，少年儿童读物供不应求的严重情况，引起了党和政府的极大注意，并要求有关部门认真地对待这个问题，迅速改进工作，大量地创作、出版和发行少年儿童读物。说少年儿童读物缺乏，自然不是同解放前相比。据几位有二十多年历史的老出版工作者估计，抗日战争以前的十年中，出儿童读物的五家主要书店，如商务、中华、开明、北新、儿童，所出的少年儿童读物不超过两千种，印数每种平均只在三、四千册左右。但是新中国成立后，从一九五○到一九五四五年当中，就出版了新的儿童读物约二千八百多种（连环画未计在内），发行约五千七百万册。
    问题不在这里。问题是在同今天现实的大量需要相比，同我们国家一日千里的发展情势相比，少年儿童读物的出版工作，目前是显得远远地落后了。——一亿二千万少年儿童中，现在识字的有七千万，但去年每五个人只能得到一册书（不包括连环画），每十七个人只能得到一册初版的新书；全国现有五十多万所小学，但去年少年儿童读物每种平均印数只有一万多册；上海租阅反动、淫秽、荒诞图书的旧书摊每天有五万人次的少年儿童读者，而我们还没有足够的新书把这块毒流横溢的阵地全部占领过来。只用这两三个数字，就足以说明现在少年儿童读物的品种和印数实在都是太少了。
    但上面还只是一般地说少年儿童缺乏读物，再细看一下，问题就更加严重。这首先就是我们现在出版的儿童读物，一般都是以城市少年儿童为对象的，适合最大量的农村少年儿童阅读的书尤其缺乏。根据河北省的统计，平均一千一百多人才有一本。其次是给兄弟民族的少年儿童读物奇缺，只有民族出版社出版一些，内蒙古自治区和新疆人民出版社也出得很少。又其次是年龄越小的孩子越没有书看，我们出的低年级儿童读物很少，学龄前的儿童读物几乎等于没有。去年少年儿童出版社新出的图画故事和幼儿画册就只有三十种，加上人民美术出版社的三十五种儿童连环画，也还是少得可怜。方面也不全得很，像少年儿童十分需要的美术、音乐、游戏方面的书，简直很难在书店里看到。文学书籍是创作得少，几年来每年出版的种数，大体都只及到同类翻译书的一半以下。反映现实斗争和国家建设的作品十分难得，革命历史故事、英雄人物传记更是凤毛麟角。从质量上看是好书太少。各科知识性读物，一般都写得枯燥乏味，在儿童图书室的书架上，它们往往长期保持着新书的风姿，没有小读者去把它看旧翻破。
    面对着这些事实，全国的出版工作者现在应该考虑的，就是如何在最短的时间内，基本上把这种情况改变过来。
    要大量出版少年儿童读物，需要各有关部门共同做极大的努力。在出版工作方面，设法增强现有的少年儿童出版机构的编辑力量，添办新的专业出版社，在各省、市有条件的人民出版社设立少年儿童读物编辑人员或机构，要求有些中央级出版社在自己的出版计划中增加少年儿童读物部分等等，都是非常重要的办法。
    选题计划是出版工作的基础。每一个出版少年儿童读物的出版社首先要订出明年或较长期的选题计划。少年儿童出版社已经有一个从一九五五年到一九五七年的三年选题计划。这个计划需要再广泛征求意见，请有关领导部门，根据今天的要求，重新加以审查修订，对其中供应不同年龄的各种不同程度的读物的比例，文学和各科知识读物的比例，首先着重发展的方面，必须实现的重要选题，都要再加以适当的规定，并且把选题的指标扩大。
    但是，从过去少年儿童读物出版工作的情形看来，更重要的还是团结和培养作家，做好组织稿件的工作。没有作家就没有书稿。创作是出版的前提。在这里作家是主体。但出版社是由作家到读者的桥梁，是掌握国家出版物质力量的机构，是国家出版计划的实际执行者。书稿虽然是作家写的，但却由出版社集中处理，才同读者见面。因此在推动创作发展上，出版社对待作家的态度如何，组织工作做得怎样，就有极重要的意义。现在许多作者反映说：呼吁他们写作少年儿童读物的声音常常有，但门前却看不到出版社编辑的足迹。这个情况一定要改变。出版社首先是少年儿童出版社，迫切需要在最近向全国各地的作者展开约稿，广泛地同文学作家、科学家、美术家、翻译工作者、教育工作者、少年儿童工作者们订立为少年儿童一、二年内至少写一部书的合同。到明年这种合同应当有千个以上，才能保证出版品种指标迅速地增长。组稿的对象如上面所说，方面必须很广，也不限在大城市，更不能只限于曾写过少年儿童读物的作者。因为在我们中国，不仅专业作家极少，连为少年儿童动过笔的业余作者也不多，只有动员大家来写这一条出路。也因为情况如此，出版社就绝不能只是向作者“订约”而已，出版社必须耐心地帮助他们写作，向他们反映少年儿童读者的情况，帮助他们同少年儿童读者取得联系，细致地审读他们的稿件。只有这样，才能使对少年儿童比较生疏的作者，也能顺利地写出适合他们阅读的书稿来。
    特别要强调的是培养新生力量。几年来出现了一批少年儿童读物新作者，中国青年出版社和少年儿童出版社的出版物中就常见到新人的名字。“少年文艺”从一九五三年七月创办到一九五四年底，投稿的作者至少有五千人，除去约三分之二以上的中学生一般写作水平较低，还有一、二千人是报社记者、出版社编辑、中小学教师、部队和机关干部、大学生、少数工人，其中因为作品写得较好已同“少年文艺”经常联系的有一百四十人左右。其他少年儿童报刊也都有自己发现、培养、联系的一批新作者。这些人现在虽然多数是初学写作、水平不高；但我们必须从这里培养新的作者，建立新的队伍，对其中有前途肯努力的作者要给予特殊的帮助，要尽力扶持他们成长。过去这个工作做得很差，中国青年出版社和少年儿童出版社的许多新作者，大多数出了一本书之后，便再看不见第二本，必须消除这种现象。出版社的编辑工作人员必须认识这是对将来少年儿童读物出版事业发展前途有根本意义的一项工作。
    在扩大著作翻译力量的时候，也要注意旧出版业留下来的一些少年儿童读物编写者和绘画作者。这种人在上海等大城市里有相当数量，其中颇有些精于业务和技巧熟练的人。在私营书店的社会主义改造过程中，国家出版社要注意把这一部分当中可用的人组织起来，分散转业了的，也可以设法再加以集中。要给他们以教育，给他们出题目、定计划，领导他们进行一些编写和绘图的工作。
    现在五、六千字以上的儿童文学作品常常找不到地方发表，这是对创作发展十分不利的。因此，“少年文艺”的编辑力量和领导力量都要加强，要考虑增加篇幅，改进内容，让更多的作品有一个经常可以发表的园地。
    除了大力组织新的创作，出版社还要设法扩大可以出版的少年儿童读物的范围。比如在文学读物方面，有些本来不是专为少年儿童写作但却也适合少年儿童阅读的。像“吕梁英雄传”这一类的中国文学作品，就可以印行分册的多加插图的儿童版。也可以编选包括鲁迅在内的中国著名作家以及外国著名作家的专给儿童阅读的作品选集。可以编选中国民间传说，神话故事，出版翻译成现代语言的中国旧有的寓言、故事、古典小说的节本、改写本。翻译的范围也还可以扩充，除了苏联和人民民主国家的少年儿童读物，对其他国家古典儿童文学作品和当代进步作品，也要有计划地选择翻译过来。现在安徒生的童话，还没有出儿童版，格林姆童话、鲁滨逊飘流记、格列佛游记、列那狐的故事等等也没有新的为儿童译的本子。科学幻想和冒险小说更是一个未经开辟的园地。这说明能够设法扩大的方面是很多的。
    面对这样重大的任务，做出版工作的同志最担心的是编辑力量不够，因为就是现在，像少年儿童出版社，已经每年有二千多部稿件，经常处理不了。这当然是一个困难。但也必须了解：任何时候出版社都不可能拥有同出版物增加永远成正比例的大量编辑人员。办好出版社必须依靠群众这句话的意义，除了依靠作家，依靠读者，还包括在编辑工作上也必须依靠社会力量。现在有些出版社对运用社会力量，还仅限于校对译稿和审读专门性质的稿件，其实在编辑工作上运用社会力量的范围很广，各种稿件的初审、审定、加工、查对以及插图、封面装帧，都可以分别约请社外的人担任。出版社应当改变包下来办而又办不了多少的做法，而把很大一部分力量放到组织工作上。为了迅速增加少年儿童读物，首先是专业出版社一定要在自己周围团结一批固定的社会力量，这是困难的但却是最实际的解决办法。作家协会、报刊编辑部门、文化教育机关和学术研究团体在这方面也要大力给予赞助。
    把团结和培养作家、广泛组织稿件和在编辑工作上运用社会力量这两件工作做好，我们将不难在现有出版力量的基础上，大大地增加少年儿童读物的出版数量。在目前着重解决数量问题的时候，出版工作者没有理由因此忽视质量。在这方面必须保证出版物有一定的思想艺术水平，但同时也要从实际出发，逐步提高质量，质量是要从数量的发展中来提高的。因此要特别爱护每一部创作，尽力帮助它经过修改成为可用的书稿。
    现在的少年儿童读物的定价，虽然已经在今年三月降低了百分之二十二，和一般通俗读物相等，但仍比文学作品普及本每印张高百分之十一点六，比业余学校课本每印张高百分之三十六点七，这同儿童读者的购买力特别是农村儿童的购买力不相适应。因此，出版社还要在有关政府部门协助之下，努力改进业务管理，实行节约，减少浪费，以求再降低价格。有人因为强调儿童读物的印制质量，就不考虑定价多少，是不对的。但也不能只顾定价低，而不问质量如何。对一般少年儿童读物我们仍要求有较高的印制质量，也需要一些特别精美的出版物，这是不能改变的。因此，出版社只有采取精打细算并尽可能压低利润的办法来解决这个问题。同时也可以考虑把若干种书印两种版本，把普及的版本以最低价格大量向农村发行。
    出版部门绝没有可能单独完成这个重大任务。从出版工作者的角度看来，我们迫切要求的第一是中国作家协会加强对儿童文学创作的领导，解决现在创作上许多亟需解决的思想问题。逐步建立一支专业的队伍，并且直接给业余的少年儿童文学工作者以写作上的帮助。第二是美术家的大力支持。要提倡大家动手为少年儿童读物插图、装帧，以提高今后出版物的质量。第三是教育部门号召和支持广大中、小学教员在业余从事少年儿童读物的写作。因为教师的队伍正是可能生长出无数少年儿童读物作者的沃土。第四是发行工作的改进。书店可以和出版社共同拟定计划，每年根据不同对象各选出十至二十种新书重点地大量推广。我们希望报刊多多批评和介绍新书，也希望高等教育部考虑在几个师范大学或综合大学的文学系里添设儿童文学组或研究生，为培养专业干部作长远打算。
    只要有关部门重视起来，共同努力，目前少年儿童读物缺乏的情况，是可以迅速改变的。出版工作者在党的领导下，也完全有信心做好自己的一部分工作。
