Shanghai Holds Exhibition to Purge Counter-Revolutionary Elements

The "Exhibition to Purge Counter-Revolutionary Elements," organized by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Artists Association, has been on display at the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall since August 30th.

The works in this exhibition are mostly serial cartoons, totaling 203 pieces, in addition to 36 cartoons and continuous cartoons, and 8 propaganda posters. These works depict the ugly faces of counter-revolutionary elements and the harm their criminal activities cause to our socialist construction. Many works vividly portray the true stories of vigilant and courageous soldiers, workers, and neighborhood workers struggling against counter-revolutionary elements; many works also powerfully criticize right-leaning paralysis of thought. The crimes of counter-revolutionary elements Li Dehou and Li Wanming, revealed by Minister of Public Security Luo Ruiqing at the Second Session of the National People's Congress, have also been vividly drawn into serial cartoons and displayed. All the exhibited works were created collectively by art workers in Shanghai in a concentrated effort over the past month and a half.

The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Artists Association has reproduced 95 sets of the exhibited works, totaling more than 23,400 pieces, and plans to successively exhibit them at 38 locations including workers' clubs and cultural centers in Shanghai, as well as in 52 cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Anhui, and other five provinces, and Beijing.

    上海举办肃清反革命分子画展
    中国美术家协会上海分会举办的“肃清反革命分子画展”，八月三十日起已在上海中苏友谊馆展出。
    这次展览的作品，多数是连环画，共二百零三幅，此外还有漫画和连续漫画三十六幅，宣传画八幅。这些作品刻划出了反革命分子的丑恶面目和他们的罪恶活动对于我们社会主义建设的危害性。许多作品生动地描绘了机警勇敢的战士、职工、里弄工作人员同反革命分子作斗争的真实的故事；也有许多作品有力地批判了右倾麻痹思想。公安部部长罗瑞卿在全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的发言中所揭露的反革命分子李德厚和李万铭的罪行，也被形象地绘成连环画陈列了出来。展出的全部作品，都是上海的美术工作者在最近一个半月内突击地集体创作的。
    中国美术家协会上海分会已把展出作品，复制了九十五套，共二万三千四百多幅，准备在上海各工人俱乐部、文化馆等三十八个地点以及江苏、浙江、福建、山东、安徽等五省的五十二个城市和北京等地相继展出。
