How Jinan City Carries Out the Work of Rationing Grain Supply
Sun Chengzuo

Jinan City began to implement the grain rationing supply method on September 1st. Prior to this, an investigation was first conducted on the grain consumption of various types of people and industries throughout the city. Based on the survey data, detailed rules for the implementation of the provisional measures for grain rationing supply in the city were formulated. Subsequently, over one thousand staff members were trained, and the districts also trained more than fifteen thousand grassroots workers above the level of residents' group leaders, and began the work of assessing supply grades. After completing the above preparatory work, publicity and mobilization, as well as the evaluation of supply grades and standards, were launched on August 22nd. By September 4th, the assessment of the grain ration standards for residents throughout the city had been completed. When the working people of Jinan City heard about the implementation of the grain rationing supply method, their mood was stable, they believed in the measures stipulated by the state, and actively supported this measure. Some people said: The rationing standard is determined based on age and labor differences, which is reasonable, and the government should have implemented this method long ago. After the supply quantity is determined, it will benefit the country, and residents can also better arrange their own lives. Some people said: When the unified purchase and sale of grain began, I felt unaccustomed and inconvenient, but now I am used to it. There are too many benefits to unified purchase and sale.

From the perspective of the initial implementation of the grain rationing supply method, the rationing supply standards stipulated by the state are in line with the actual situation in Jinan City. This is reflected in the fact that the supply amount evaluated by the masses is mostly lower than or close to the rationing standard. The general situation is that as long as it is arranged reasonably, carefully calculated, and waste is overcome, it will not only be enough to eat, but some people will also have a surplus.

Based on initial experiences, the following issues must be noted in order to smoothly implement the grain rationing supply method.

First, in the preparatory work, attention should be paid to conducting investigations and research on the labor situation and actual grain needs of various types of people. This is the premise for comprehensively and thoroughly formulating detailed rules for the implementation of the rationing supply method and correctly grasping the implementation of rationing standards. From the investigation in Jinan City, the labor differences and types of work in agencies, organizations, and larger factories are relatively easy to determine due to the detailed division of labor. The most difficult to classify are the labor differences and types of work of members of individual handicrafts and handicraft workshops, because their division of labor is rough, one person masters multiple operations, and the intensity of labor varies greatly. As for general residents, their labor situation is also very complicated, and it is also a detailed task to understand their actual needs for grain. In-depth and meticulous investigation and classification must be carried out in these two aspects in order to appropriately divide and grasp the general limits of the supply standard range. Jinan City did not pay enough attention to the above situation at the beginning of the investigation, focusing on the investigation of large factories and agencies and organizations. Therefore, after the evaluation of grades, many problems were encountered among general residents and small private industries, which increased the difficulty of later work.

Second, the evaluation of rationing grades and standards must be done well. Implementing graded grain rationing supply for residents is a major issue related to everyone's economic life. Because we lack experience, the evaluation of rationing grades and standards must be carried out steadily in batches. In terms of steps, according to the principle of prioritizing organized masses and then general residents of the street, the evaluation should first be carried out for members of agencies, organizations, and state-owned enterprises, and employees should be required to implement the rationing supply method in an exemplary manner, actively carry out publicity and education to the masses, and help families formulate grain consumption plans according to the standards. The experience of units that have done this work well is: the leaders attach importance to it and organize a certain force to specifically grasp it, repeatedly conduct policy education to their members to dispel their ideological doubts; analyze and study the past actual grain consumption situation and the labor situation of different types of work to have a clear understanding of the needs of their own unit's personnel; at the same time, fully mobilize the masses to check for loopholes, find waste, and make detailed calculations to correctly propose personal grain needs plans. Where this is done, the assessed rationing grades and standards are more reasonable, and everyone is more satisfied. In contrast, some units have not paid enough attention by their leaders, and the ideological mobilization of the masses is insufficient, resulting in many people's rationing grades and standards being assessed unreasonably. Machine Factory No. 2 and Diesel Engine Factory are the same type of factory with the same proportion of management personnel. The Diesel Engine Factory assessed the rationing supply standards for workers and staff more reasonably, while the Machine Factory No. 2's staff were assessed with a higher standard. Later, after the Machine Factory No. 2 further mobilized and re-evaluated through the Party Committee, the assessed standards became completely reasonable. These facts fully demonstrate that to achieve reasonable distribution, ideological education and careful evaluation work must be done well.

To do a good job in the evaluation of rationing supply grades and standards for general residents and private factories and shops on the streets, the primary link is to do a good job in the training of grassroots workers above the level of residents' group leaders and the evaluation of their rationing supply grades and standards. Then, through them, the evaluation work will be carried out among the residents. In this way, experience can be gained to guide the work. The evaluation of the supply grades and standards of general residents is roughly divided into three steps: (1) In view of the ideological situation of the masses, make a mobilization report to explain the significance and benefits of implementing rationing supply and saving grain; (2) Organize residents' group discussions to dispel doubts, check for waste loopholes, calculate household living accounts, and formulate grain consumption plans in accordance with the rationing method; (3) On the basis of mature deliberation through family meetings, convene residents' group meetings to conduct evaluation work. Facts have proved that as long as the first two steps are done well, and the situation of each household is grasped through the grassroots workers and activists, and they play a leading role in the group evaluation, the group's evaluation work can be completed smoothly.

Third, the average standards of various supply grades must be uniformly grasped by the city level. According to the statistics of some units, the general situation is: the standard of workers in the factory is generally more appropriate, and some management personnel promoted from workers feel it is slightly tight. The rationing standards for agency staff and mental workers generally do not exceed the standard for the city as a whole, but because the size of the unit, the number of people, the proportion of internal and external staff, and the proportion of men and women are different, it is impossible to completely balance between units. The general situation is that large units do not exceed the standard, and small units and units with more external staff and fewer female comrades are slightly higher than the average standard. But the overall situation is in line with the rationing standards stipulated by the state. The main problem encountered by Jinan City in the process of implementing the rationing standards stipulated by the State Council is: because the objects of investigation when formulating the implementation details were mainly large factories and agencies and organizations, the investigation and research on the labor situation of residents and individual handicrafts and small handicraft workshops was insufficient, and the complexity and characteristics of this aspect were not fully estimated. After the initial evaluation, it was found that the original methods of dividing types of work were not applicable to independent laborers and small workshops among residents; no clear provisions were made for comprehensive types of work, and various industries compared with each other. The leadership was unable to understand the situation for a while and could not determine it, which affected the progress of the work. In response to these situations, the following solutions were adopted: (1) A small number of workers in a factory whose needs are higher than the rationing standard or who have no clear regulations can be adjusted and assessed by each factory within the total number not exceeding the average rationing standard of the factory, and no separate regulations will be made. (2) For individual types of work that cannot be clearly classified, those that have little impact can be temporarily evaluated by each district with reference to the same type of labor intensity. (3) Independent laborers and people in small workshops whose types of work are not fixed can be evaluated with reference to the standards of the same type of labor intensity; those that are not easy to refer to can be separately studied and proposed by trade union organizations at the grassroots level, and the average standard of mixed types of work can be reported to the city for approval. (4) Household sideline labor shall be based on the standard of general citizens and shall not be classified separately. (5) Peddlers are generally based on the standard of citizens, and individual ones are allowed to be slightly higher than the standard of citizens.

At the beginning, the supply standard for general citizens did not specify the overall average and the approximate limits to be grasped separately, which resulted in a tendency to choose the higher number rather than the lower number during implementation, resulting in more than 80% of people approaching the highest number in the range of supply standards. That is to say, in fact, the highest number was turned into the lowest number. In order to correct the deviation of high supply, the approximate limits to be grasped were determined based on the average of the supply standards officially announced by the State Council, taking into account the different situations of adults and the elderly and the weak, so as to be grasped in the evaluation. Another reason for the high evaluation of residents' supply standards is that some residents are unwilling to lower the figures whose actual needs are lower than the standard, while individual residents whose actual needs exceed the standard require raising the standard. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the method of evaluating the whole family by quantifying the individual, which is not only easy to evaluate, but also prevents the quantification from being too high, and remedies the shortcomings of unreasonable quantification of various types of personnel.

Fourth, we must resolutely crack down on the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and speculators. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the grain rationing supply measures, we must first strengthen publicity and education to the masses, improve political vigilance, and promptly expose and report the sabotage activities of bad elements. Secondly, the public security departments must strictly control the counter-revolutionaries under control. In addition, we must strengthen the inspection and management of cooked food shops and grain consignment shops, and deal with illegal households in cooked food shops and grain consignment shops in accordance with the law. These measures are of great importance to ensuring the stability of the grain market and ensuring the smooth implementation of grain rationing measures.

专栏：做好市镇粮食定量供应工作

    济南市怎样进行粮食定量供应工作
    孙承祚
    济南市从九月一日开始实行了粮食定量供应办法。在这以前，首先，对全市各类人口和行业用粮情况进行了调查。根据调查资料，制定了市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法实施细则。接着便对抽调的一千多名工作人员进行了训练，各区也对居民小组长以上一万五千多名基层工作人员进行了训练，并开始了供应等别标准的评定工作。在完成上述筹备工作之后，于八月二十二日展开了宣传动员和评议供应等别、标准的工作。到九月四日为止，全市居民口粮定量标准的评定工作已全部结束。济南市劳动人民听到实行粮食定量供应办法的时候，情绪稳定，相信国家规定的办法，并积极拥护这一措施。有些人说：定量标准是根据年龄和劳动差别规定的，是合理的，政府早就该实行这个办法了。供应数量定下来之后，对国家有好处，居民也可以更好地安排自己的生活。有些人说：粮食统购统销开始时，感觉不习惯，不方便，现在习惯了。统购统销的好处太多了。
    从粮食定量供应办法初步实施的情况看，国家规定的定量供应标准是符合济南市的实际情况的。这表现在：经过群众评定的供应量，绝大多数都低于定量标准或接近定量标准。一般的情况是：只要合理安排，精打细算，克服浪费，不仅可以够吃，而且某些人还有节余。
    根据初步体会，要顺利地实行粮食定量供应办法，必须注意以下几个问题。
    第一、在准备工作中，要注意做好对各类人口的劳动情况和粮食实需情况的调查研究工作，这是全面、周到地制定定量供应办法实施细则、正确掌握执行定量标准的前提。从济南市调查的情况来看，机关、团体和较大工厂的劳动差别和工种，因分工细致，各种供应等别和类型比较容易确定。最难划分的是个体手工业和手工工场、作坊中的成员的劳动差别和工种，因为他们的分工粗，一个人掌握多种操作，而且劳动强度变化多。至于一般居民，由于他们的劳动情况也很复杂，要了解他们对粮食的实需情况，也是一个细致的工作。对这两方面的情况必须进行深入细致的调查、分类，才能适当划分掌握供应标准幅度的大体界限。济南市在开始调查时对上述情况注意不够，着重调查了大型工厂和机关、团体方面，因此，评定等别以后，在一般居民和私营小型工业中曾经遇到许多问题，给后来的工作增加了困难。
    第二、必须做好定量等别、标准的评定工作。实行居民口粮分等定量供应，是关系每个人经济生活的重大问题，由于我们缺乏经验，定量等别、标准的评定工作必须稳步地分批进行。在步骤上，根据先有组织的群众后街道一般居民的原则，首先对机关、团体、国营企业的成员进行评议，并要求职工模范地执行定量供应办法，积极向群众进行宣传教育，帮助家庭按照标准订好用粮计划。这一工作做得较好的单位的经验是：领导人员重视，并组织一定力量具体掌握，反复向所属人员进行政策教育，解除他们的思想疑虑；根据过去实际用粮情况和不同工种的劳动情况进行分析、研究，做到对本单位人员的需要心中有数；同时充分发动群众查漏洞、找浪费、算细账，正确地提出个人需粮计划。凡是这样做的单位，评定的定量等别、标准比较合理，大家也都比较满意。和这相反，有些单位由于领导人员重视不够，群众的思想发动不够，结果造成许多人的定量等别、标准评定不合理。机器二厂和柴油机厂是同一类型的厂子，管理人员比例相同，柴油机厂评定工人、职员的定量供应标准都比较合理，而机器二厂职员评定的定量标准都偏高。后来机器二厂经过党委进一步深入动员和重新评议之后，评定的标准就完全合理了。这些事实充分说明，要做到合理分配，必须做好思想教育和细致的评定工作。
    要做好街道一般居民和私营厂、店的定量供应等别、标准的评定工作，首要一环是做好居民小组长以上的基层工作人员的训练及其定量等别、标准的评定工作。然后通过他们再在居民中展开评定工作。这样，可以取得经验，指导工作。一般居民的供应等别、标准的评定工作大体上分三步进行：（一）针对群众思想情况，做好动员报告，说明实行定量供应和节约粮食的意义、好处；（二）组织居民小组座谈讨论，解除疑虑，检查浪费的漏洞，算家庭生活账，酝酿按定量办法制定用粮计划；（三）在通过家庭会议酝酿成熟的基础上召开居民小组会议，进行评定工作。事实证明，只要头两步作好了，并通过基层工作人员和积极分子串连走访，掌握了各户情况，在小组评议中起带头作用，小组的评定工作就能顺利完成。
    第三、各类供应等别的平均标准必须由市级统一掌握。根据部分单位统计来看，大致情况是：工厂当中工人的标准一般较适当，部分从工人中提拔的管理人员感到略紧。机关工作人员和脑力劳动者的定量标准，全市总平均不超过标准，但由于单位大小、人数多少不同，内、外勤人员的比例不同，男女人数比例不同，因而单位之间不可能完全平衡。一般情况是：大单位不超过标准，小单位和外勤人员多、女同志少的单位略高于平均标准。但总的情况是符合国家规定的定量标准的。济南市在执行国务院规定的定量标准过程中遇到的主要问题是：由于制定实施细则时调查的对象主要是大工厂和机关、团体，对居民和个体手工业、小型手工作坊的劳动情况调查研究不够，未能充分估计到这一方面的复杂性和特点，开始评议后发现原规定的工种划分办法不适用于居民中独立劳动者和小作坊的情况；对综合工种未作明确规定，各行业互相攀比，领导方面又一时弄不清情况，不好确定，影响工作的进行。针对这些情况采取了以下解决办法：（一）一个工厂内少数工人需量高于定量标准或无明确规定者，可在不超过该厂平均定量标准总数之内，各厂自行调剂评定，不再单独规定。（二）个别不能明确分类的工种，凡影响不大者，各区暂比照同类劳动强度评定。（三）独立劳动者和小作坊中的工种不固定的人，可比照同类劳动强度的标准评定；不好比照者，由工会组织基层工作人员单独按业研究提出混合工种的平均标准，报市批准。（四）家庭副业劳动一律按一般市民标准，不单独划类。（五）摊贩一般按市民标准，个别的允许适当地略高于市民标准。
    一般市民的供应标准，开始由于未规定总平均数和分别掌握的大体界限，在执行中发生了从高不从低的偏向，造成百分之八十以上的人接近供应标准幅度的最高数，这就是说，实际上将最高数变成了最低数。为了纠正供应偏高的偏差，又根据国务院正式公布的供应标准的平均数分别壮年和老弱等不同情况，确定了三个大体掌握的界限，以便评定中掌握。评定居民供应标准偏高的另一个原因是有些居民对实际需要量低于标准的数字不愿降下来，而个别实际需要超过标准的，则要求提高标准。因此，必须采取以人定量全家计算的办法评定，这样不仅容易评定，且可防止定量偏高，补救各类人员定量不尽合理的缺点。
    第四、必须坚决打击反革命分子和投机商人的破坏活动。为了保证粮食定量供应措施的顺利贯彻，首先应加强对群众的宣传教育，提高政治警惕性，及时揭发、检举坏分子的破坏活动。其次，公安部门必须对被管制的反革命分子严加管制。另外，必须对熟食店和粮食代销店加强检查管理，并对熟食店和粮食代销店中的违法户依法予以处理。这些措施对于保证粮食市场的稳定、对于保证粮食定量措施的顺利实施，有重要的作用。
