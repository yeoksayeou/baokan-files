    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 5th. Talks between the Soviet government and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on establishing normal relations between the two countries are scheduled to begin on September 9th in Moscow. Bonn officials already released the list of personnel for the Federal Republic of Germany delegation, headed by Chancellor Adenauer, on the 4th. Delegation members include Foreign Minister Brentano, State Secretary of the Chancellery Globke, Deputy Foreign Minister Hallstein, Ambassador to NATO Blankenhorn, Ambassador to the United Nations Eckhardt, and other officials. In addition, Arnold, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Kissinger, Chairman of the Federal Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee, and Schmidt will accompany the delegation. The delegation will fly to Moscow on the 8th.
    Recently, Adenauer's upcoming visit to Moscow has been the focus of attention for the German public. Political leaders, prominent social figures, newspaper and radio commentators, and millions of ordinary people all expect the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany to seize this opportunity to normalize West Germany's relations with the Soviet Union, thereby contributing to the relaxation of international tensions and improving prospects for resolving the German question.
    West German public opinion is increasingly recognizing that the outdated and bankrupt "policy of strength" should be abandoned in favor of another policy that can truly solve the German question. For example, the "Southwest Review" put forward this view. Similarly, people are increasingly aware that the Paris Agreements and the subsequent re-militarization of West Germany are hindering the resolution of the German unification issue. The Social Democratic Party's "New Rheinische Zeitung" commented that West Germany's intensified rearmament efforts and demands that the Soviet Union accept the "fait accompli" of the Paris Agreements will only create obstacles to the German unification issue.
    Many West German newspapers emphasized that the normalization of relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union is in the interests of the German people because it will promote the resolution of the German question. The "German People's Newspaper" said that if the Federal Republic wants to contribute to the reunification of Germany by easing tensions, then its primary task is to establish normal relations with the Soviet Union.
    At the same time, West German economic circles attach great importance to the possibility of the Moscow talks promoting trade development with the Soviet Union. According to the Paris "International Forum" weekly: German business people hope that the Moscow talks can be conducted in the "Geneva spirit." They are very interested in broad opportunities for exporting to and importing from Eastern Europe.

    苏联政府同西德政府的会谈即将在莫斯科举行
    西德公众普遍要求同苏联的关系正常化
    新华社柏林五日电　苏联政府同德意志联邦共和国政府关于建立两国之间的正常关系的会谈定于九月九日在莫斯科举行。波恩官方已经在四日公布了以总理阿登纳为首的德意志联邦共和国代表团人员的名单。代表团成员包括外交部长勃伦塔诺、总理办公厅国务秘书格罗布克、外交部副部长哈尔斯坦、驻北大西洋公约组织大使布兰肯豪恩、驻联合国大使埃克哈特和其他官员。此外，陪同前往的还有参议院外交委员会主席阿诺德、联邦议院外交委员会主席基辛格和施密特。代表团将在八日乘飞机前往莫斯科。
    最近以来，阿登纳即将前往莫斯科进行访问一事是德国公众注意的中心。政界领袖和社会知名人士、报纸和电台的评论员以及千百万普通人民，都期待着德意志联邦共和国政府代表团能够利用这次机会来实现西德同苏联关系的正常化，从而对国际紧张局势的缓和作出贡献并且改进解决德国问题的前景。
    西德舆论愈来愈认识到，应当放弃过时的和破了产的“实力政策”，而奉行另一种真正能解决德国问题的政策。例如，“西南评论”就提出了这种主张。同样，人们也一天比一天了解巴黎协定和随之而来的西德重新军国主义化阻碍了德国统一问题的解决。社会民主党的“新莱因报”在评论中指出，西德加紧重新武装的工作并且要求苏联接受巴黎协定的“既成事实”只会给德国统一问题树立障碍。
    西德许多报纸着重指出西德同苏联之间关系的正常化是符合德国人民的利益的，因为这将促进德国问题的解决。“德国人民报”说，如果联邦共和国要通过缓和紧张局势来对德国的重新统一有所贡献，那末它的首要的工作就是同苏联建立正常关系。
    同时，西德的经济界人士非常重视莫斯科会谈促进同苏联发展贸易的可能性。据巴黎“国际论坛”周刊报道：德国商界人士希望莫斯科会谈能够在“日内瓦精神”下进行。他们对于向东欧输出和从东欧输入的广泛机会感到很大兴趣。
