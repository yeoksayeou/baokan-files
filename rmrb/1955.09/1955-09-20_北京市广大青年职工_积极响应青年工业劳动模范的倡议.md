The initiative put forward by Li Youzhi and other fourteen young industrial labor models in Beijing regarding "Striving to improve product quality, save raw materials, and comprehensively complete the national plan" has been enthusiastically responded to and supported by the broad young workers in the city.

　　Over 80% of young workers and production teams and groups dominated by young people in major factories and mines have formulated or are formulating action plans in response to the initiative. In the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, more than 2,000 young workers and 43 production teams and groups dominated by young people have formulated action plans in response to the initiative. Eleven youth savings teams have enthusiastically launched competitions, with eight teams planning to save more than 40,000 yuan of wealth for the country in September. Five young blanking workers in the production preparation area of the freight car workshop have saved 63 tons of new iron plates since the beginning of this year, and they guarantee to save another 40 tons of new iron plates by the end of the year. Young lathe operator Zhang Jinming has not produced any defective products in the past three years, and he completed the annual production task on August 10th this year. This time, he guarantees to complete the task 80 hours ahead of schedule every month by the end of the year. He also guarantees not to produce a single defective product in the first Five-Year Plan and strives to eliminate defective products and rework phenomena. After improving equipment and operations, the youth team of hot blast stoves at a blast furnace in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has increased wind temperature by 40 degrees this year, saving 1,052 kilograms of coke per day. Now, they guarantee to increase wind temperature by another 30 degrees by the end of the year without any major or minor accidents. Within three days of receiving the initiative, 1,468 young workers and more than 20 youth teams, groups, and shock brigades in the Jingxi Mining Bureau successively revised their guarantee conditions. The Fangshan Mine Youth Tunneling Shock Brigade guarantees to over fulfill the footage task by 25 meters in September and guarantees no accidents. All the young people at the Qianmen Substation of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau have achieved 430 consecutive days of safe and accident-free power supply. Now, they guarantee to reach a new record of 545 days of safe power supply by the end of the year. All the young drivers of the second and third motorcades of the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company guarantee to save another 1,000 gallons of gasoline by the end of the year.

　　After the city's young workers responded to the initiative of the young labor models, they have made many achievements in just a few days. After responding to the initiative, six young quarry machine operator assistants at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant quarry actively improved the angle of the rock crushing machine's tooth plate and shaft plate. On September 14th, the daily output increased from 220 tons in early September to 253 tons. The youths of the engineering section of the transportation department, in order to ensure safe driving, used their spare time to refresh 156 switch points and warning bell signs. After hearing the initiative, the youths of Wang Cheng's team in the first mining team of the Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau set a new record for coal output on the same day, increasing the daily output from 120 cars to 197 cars. From September 9th to 11th, the Wanfotang Youth Rock Tunneling Team overfulfilled the footage task by 2.38 meters in three days. After responding to the initiative, Dong Xiangge, a young man in the bread workshop of the Yili Food Company, was able to shake out four ounces of flour from the 50 empty flour bags used in the workshop every day. By September 16th, he had shaken out a total of one and a half catties of white flour, and she promised to continue this work forever.

　　Adult and elderly workers in many factories and mines have also expressed their support for the initiative of the young labor models and actively helped young people formulate and implement action plans in response to the initiative. Wang Enru, the section chief of the processing workshop of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, said: "Young people have low skills and are prone to producing defective products. I will patiently guide them, often check their work, and help them improve their skills so that the young people can better implement the action plans in response to the initiative of the young labor models." Hao Jihe, an old worker of the boiling cloth pot group in the Beijing Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, in order to support the initiative of the labor models, he guaranteed to teach the newly arrived young apprentices in the group to operate independently within three months and help them improve product quality. All the master craftsmen and young workers of the leak detection team in the water supply workshop of the Beijing Water Supply Company have formulated a plan to check for water leaks from now until the end of the year and guarantee that the quality reaches 100 percent.

    北京市青年工业劳动模范李友芝等十四人提出的关于“努力提高产品质量、节约原材料、全面完成国家计划”的倡议，已经获得了全市广大青年职工的热烈响应和支持。
    各大厂矿企业约有百分之八十以上的青年职工和青年占多数的生产班、组已经制定出或正在制定响应倡议的行动计划。长辛店机车车辆修理厂有二千多名青年职工和四十三个青年占多数的生产班、组已经订出响应倡议的行动计划；十一个青年节约队热烈地展开了竞赛，其中八个队计划在九月份为国家节约四万多元的财富；货车车间生产准备工区的五个青年下料工，今年以来已经节省了六十三吨新铁板，他们保证到年底再节省四十吨新铁板；青年车工张金铭，三年来没有出废品，今年八月十日就完成了全年的生产任务，这次他保证到年底每月都提前八十小时完成任务；还保证在第一个五年计划里不出一个废品，争取消灭次品和返工现象。石景山钢铁厂某高炉热风炉青年小组，经过改进设备和操作，今年以来提高风温四十度，每天可以节约
  一千零五十二公斤焦炭；现在他们保证到年底再提高风温三十度，不出任何大小事故。京西矿务局在接到倡议以后的三天中，就有一千四百六十八名青年职工和二十多个青年班、组和青年突击队，相继修订了保证条件；房山矿青年掘进突击队保证在九月份超额完成二十五公尺的进尺任务，并保证不出任何事故。北京电业局前门变电站全体青年已经做到了连续四百三十天安全无事故供电，现在他们保证到年底达到安全供电五百四十五天的新纪录。北京市汽车运输公司第二、第三汽车队的全体青年司机，保证到年底再节约一千加仑汽油。

    许多厂矿的成年老年职工，也纷纷表示支持青年劳动模范的倡议，积极帮助青年制定和实现响应倡议的行动计划。北京第一机床厂加工车间工段长王恩儒说：“青年的技术低，容易出废品，我要耐心指点他们，常去检查检查他们的工作，帮助他们提高技术，让小伙子们更好地实现响应青年劳动模范倡议的行动计划。”北京市机织印染厂煮布锅小组老工人郝纪和，为了支持劳动模范的倡议，他保证在三个月内教会本组新来的青年徒工基本上能独立操作，帮助他们提高产品质量。北京市自来水公司供水车间检漏组全体老师傅和青年工人一起，订出了从现在到年底的检查漏水的计划，并保证质量达到百分之百。（青年团北京市委会青工部）
