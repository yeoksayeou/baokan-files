In his report, Lin Feng said that with the development of socialist construction, all aspects require a large and increasing number of laborers and specialists with cultural education and mastery of science and technology. He expressed hope that the young activists would take the lead in promoting the active participation of the broad masses of workers and peasants in spare-time learning, master skills, and further welcome the high tide of socialist construction; he encouraged young people in school or participating in spare-time learning to form an atmosphere of active, diligent, persistent, and closely connected with reality learning for the socialist cause.

At today's meeting, eight young activists in grain storage work attending the conference proposed launching a "four-free" granary competition among grain storage workers nationwide, to achieve granaries free of insects, mold, rodents, and accidents. Hu Jiwu, director of the Tenth District Grain Warehouse in Changshou County, Sichuan Province, and an outstanding young grain storage worker, read out this proposal on behalf of the eight of them at the meeting.
