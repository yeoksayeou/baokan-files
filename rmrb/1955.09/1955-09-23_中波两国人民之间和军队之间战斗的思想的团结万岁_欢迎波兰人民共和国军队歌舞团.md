Long Live the Ideological Solidarity of the Fighting Peoples and Armies of China and Poland
——Welcome to the Song and Dance Troupe of the Polish People's Republic Army
Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

"Long live the solidarity of the fighting ideas between the people and the armies of China and Poland," was the last sentence in the speech by Lieutenant Colonel Volva, representative of the General Political Department of the Polish Army, at the welcoming meeting at Beijing Railway Station. I think this sentence is very meaningful. The solidarity between our two peoples and between our armies is indeed not only a fighting one, but more importantly, an ideological one, because only ideological solidarity can consolidate combat solidarity.

I once visited Poland with the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and had some contact with the Polish people and their heroic army. The deepest impression they gave me was that they paid great attention to ideological education in the army. To give a small example: at the famous port of Gdansk (i.e. the pre-war Danzig Corridor), we visited the Polish Naval Museum in heavy rain, and a slogan in front of the museum deeply moved us: "As long as there is a drop of water left in the Baltic Sea, it will always belong to the Polish people." This not only demonstrated the fighting spirit of the Polish Navy, but also the lofty patriotism of the Polish Navy. Entering the museum, you can see from the history of Polish shipbuilding to the history of the Polish Navy that almost every photograph, picture, or object is used to educate the Polish people and army on how to love their motherland and how to defend it. The same situation can be seen in the Military Museum in Warsaw.

Among the ordinary Polish people, we also saw the influence of this ideological education.

Poland has built many new things in its ten years of socialist construction, but for many historical things that were destroyed by the war, even if it is only half a statue left in a house, it must be preserved and embedded in the restored and rebuilt building. In some places, we also saw churches with high artistic value that were restored to their original appearance. The purpose is to cultivate the people's patriotic feelings, let the people recall, and thus defend the past glory of their motherland. On the other hand, it is to show the great construction power of the Polish people and army.

The great musician – Chopin, the most glorious son of the Polish people, instructed before his death: after his death, his heart must be sent back to Poland. Comrade Bierut personally buried the symbolic heart of this great son of the Polish people, a symbol of lofty patriotism.

In addition to patriotic education, they have not relaxed the education of the people in internationalist thought. They always humbly and respectfully talk about the Soviet people and the Soviet army, even though their own army once fought alongside the Soviet army in Berlin; when talking about the great achievements in economic construction, national defense construction, cultural construction, and other aspects, they always regard the friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries as a very important factor. Wherever there are Soviet military martyrs' tombs and memorial towers, they will suggest that we go to lay flowers and pay our respects.

The friendship and solidarity between China and Poland have been greatly enhanced since Premier Zhou Enlai visited Poland and Comrade Bierut visited our country. In the Bedgoszcz region, a responsible comrade of the state once told us in detail about the increasing friendship and solidarity between our two countries. He said: After Comrade Bierut returned from China, he gave them a two-day report on China. When everyone was having dinner together, the responsible comrade of the state also added what Comrade Bierut had told them about how Chairman Mao educated young people and educated the army.

Wherever we went, we often saw slogans like this: "Welcome to the representatives of the invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army." Whenever we encountered such a situation, we were filled with gratitude.

All of these can be called their great ideological work among the people and the army. These works are all to strengthen the ideological unity of the Polish people and the people of all fraternal countries.

"Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism!" is a clear sign of this ideological solidarity.

As for the Polish army – the heroic sons of the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, from the day the first Polish army division named after Kosciuszko, the leader of the Polish peasant uprising, was established in 1943 in Szerze, near the Oka River in the Soviet Union, until it later developed into the Polish First Army, fighting alongside the Soviet army, liberating Warsaw, and directly attacking Berlin, they educated cadres and soldiers with this lofty spirit of patriotism and internationalism. Before that, the outstanding sons of Poland had also participated in the battle to defend Madrid, the capital of Spain.

This makes the Polish army, like their country, a powerful force for defending peace in our peace, democracy, and socialist camp in Europe.

The Song and Dance Troupe of the Polish People's Republic Army is visiting our country with this lofty idea of patriotism and internationalism. I firmly believe that the people and army of our country will deeply appreciate this lofty idea from them.

From the day it was created (the year it was created was also the year the first division of the Polish army was created), this song and dance troupe has been marching, living and fighting with the Polish army. At first, they only had twenty or thirty people. They started serving the troops with poems, plays, and songs by famous poets in the Polish army at that time, such as Shingwald, Vazik, Bastelrak, and Plutkowski, expressing the thoughts and feelings of the soldiers, and constantly educating the soldiers with patriotism and the fighting friendship of the Soviet army.

On December 25, 1943, the song and dance troupe gave a pleasant performance of its own programs to the soldiers of the Second Division for the first time, and continued to be with them throughout the entire combat march afterwards.

In 1944, the song and dance troupe gave a series of larger performances, such as the performance in Smolensk in January and the performance in Lemberdorf near Warsaw in September. At that time, the song and dance troupe had grown to more than seventy people.

In January 1945, the song and dance troupe obtained the title of the Song and Dance Troupe of the First Army of the Polish Army, and under this name, it passed through Warsaw, Bedgoszcz, through the Pomrzy front, and finally arrived in Berlin. It was the only large-scale song and dance troupe in the Polish army and the Polish state at that time with excellent singers, musicians, and dancers.

Since then, the song and dance troupe has not only performed frequently in Warsaw, but also traveled to the most remote areas of Poland to perform for the Polish soldiers who were training in the camps and the Polish troops who were performing extremely difficult tasks.

The song and dance troupe has also visited Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Soviet Union, and has been warmly welcomed and highly praised by these countries and peoples.

Due to its achievements in artistic activities at home and abroad for many years, the song and dance troupe won the National Prize in 1951 and the Order of the Labor Banner, First Class, in 1954.

Last year – October 12, 1954, we were fortunate to see the performance of the song and dance troupe at the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Polish Army in Warsaw. The performance of the choir showed a majestic fighting spirit and had great touching power. Listen to the lyrics of the First Army March:

Leaving home, coming to the border,
Look——
The wind blows the willows, the golden wheat fields are dyed,
The road is not far.
Take off your rags, put on your military uniform, get ready, go to the battlefield;
Forward, our First Army!…………
Wait! Marusza,
The time will come.
Look——
The devil is dying,
Tears of joy, shining brightly,
Don't cry! Marusza, the past has turned to ashes.
Forward, our First Army!…………

Look! How beautiful and powerful! The song perfectly expresses the feelings of the lyrics.

The dance team performed a section of "Flames of Paris" on the same day, which also showed a strong fighting spirit and high skills. We all praised and applauded non-stop. Poland is indeed a country worthy of a high cultural and artistic tradition!

The Polish Army Song and Dance Troupe's friendship and help to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe is something we cannot forget. They fully met our requirements, providing any teacher we needed, and sending anyone we wanted to accompany the troupe. Comrade Maliyan Savatsky, the choir conductor of the song and dance troupe, helped us rehearse "The Party is Our Helmsman" (composed by Moradley), which we were preparing to perform in the Soviet Union, despite his busy work; the dance instructor choreographed the "Krakow" dance for us, and the song and dance troupe also sent us a complete set of costumes so that we could catch up with performing this program at the closing ceremony in Warsaw. They regarded our work as the same as their own.

These places also embody the great spirit of high patriotism and internationalism of the Polish army.

Such a song and dance troupe with high political thought and artistic level is visiting our country, and its expected achievements are certainly not only in the cultural exchange aspect, but more importantly, in combat, especially in the Marxist-Leninist ideology, to enhance the close unity between the people and the armies of our two countries.

I wish the song and dance troupe a great success in its performances in China!

Long live the ideological solidarity of the fighting peoples and armies of China and Poland!

    中波两国人民之间和军队之间战斗的思想的团结万岁
    ——欢迎波兰人民共和国军队歌舞团
    中国人民解放军总政治部文化部部长  陈沂
    “中波两国人民之间和军队之间战斗的思想的团结万岁”，这是波兰军队总政治部代表沃尔瓦中校在北京车站欢迎会上致词中最后的一句。我觉得这句话是非常有意义的。我们两国人民之间、军队之间的团结，的确不仅是战斗的，更重要的是思想的，因为只有思想上的团结，才能够巩固战斗上的团结。
    我曾随中国人民解放军歌舞团访问过波兰，同波兰人民及其英雄的军队有过一些接触。他们给我的最深的印象，就是他们在军队中非常注意思想教育工作。举一个很小的例子说：在著名的革但斯克（即战前的但泽走廊）海港，我们在大雨中参观了波兰海军博物馆，馆前的一幅标语使我们深受感动：“只要波罗的海还有一滴水，它就永远是波兰人民的”。这不仅表现了波兰海军的战斗气魄，也表现了波兰海军的崇高的爱国主义。进入博物馆，你更可以看到从波兰造船的历史一直到波兰海军的历史，几乎没有一张照片、一幅图画或者一件实物不是教育波兰人民和军队如何热爱自己的祖国，如何保卫自己的祖国的。同样的情况，在华沙的军事博物馆中也可以看到。
    在普通的波兰人民当中，我们同样也看到了这种思想教育的影响。
    波兰在十年社会主义建设中，建设了许多新的东西，但对于曾遭受战争破坏的许多历史东西，那怕是一座房子中唯一剩下来的半截塑像，也要把它保留下来嵌在按原样恢复和重建的建筑物中。有的地方我们还看到按原样恢复的具有高度艺术价值的教堂。其目的就是要培养人民的爱国主义的情感，让人民回想，从而保卫他们祖国过去的光荣。另一方面就是借此显示波兰人民和军队的伟大的建设力量。
    大音乐家——波兰人民最光荣的儿子萧邦，临死时嘱咐：死了之后一定要把他的心送回波兰。贝鲁特同志亲自安葬了这位波兰人民的伟大儿子、崇高的爱国主义者的象征性的心。
    爱国主义的教育之外，他们也没有放松对人民进行国际主义思想的教育，他们总是谦虚而尊敬地讲到苏联人民和苏联军队，虽然他们自己的军队曾经和苏军一道打过柏林；谈到经济建设、国防建设、文化建设以及其他方面的巨大成就，他们总是把苏联和其他兄弟国家的友谊和援助看成是非常重大的因素。凡有苏军烈士墓、纪念塔的地方，他们都要建议我们去献花、致敬。
    中波两国之间的友谊和团结，自周恩来总理访问波兰、贝鲁特同志来访我国之后，更是大大增进了。在贝德哥斯区州，一位州的负责同志就曾经很详尽地告诉过我们两国这种日益增进的友谊和团结。他说：贝鲁特同志由中国回来后向他们作了两天有关中国的报告。大家在一起吃晚饭的时候，这位州的负责同志还补充讲了贝鲁特同志告诉他们的毛主席如何教育青年，教育军队的话。
    我们所到之处，常常可以看到这样的标语：“欢迎百战百胜的中国人民解放军的代表”。每当遇到这种情景，我们都满怀着感激之情。
    所有这些都可以称为是他们在人民和军队中间的巨大思想工作。这些工作都是为了加强波兰人民和各兄弟国家人民的思想上的团结的。
    “战无不胜的马克思、列宁主义万岁！”就是这个思想团结的鲜明标志。
    至于波军——波兰人民的英雄儿子，在波兰统一工人党领导下，从一九四三年在苏联奥卡河旁的谢尔则地方以波兰农民起义领袖考什秋什科命名的波军第一师成立那一天起，以至以后发展成为波兰第一军，同苏军并肩作战，解放华沙、直捣柏林，都是以这种崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神教育干部和士兵的。在这以前，波兰的优秀儿子还参加过保卫西班牙首都马德里的战斗。
    这就使得波兰军队如同他们的国家一样，在欧洲，成为我们和平、民主、社会主义阵营中的一支强大的保卫和平的力量。
    波兰人民共和国军队歌舞团就是带着这种崇高的爱国主义和国际主义的思想来访问我国的。我深信，我国人民和军队一定会从他们身上深深地体会到这种崇高的思想。
    这个歌舞团从产生那天起（它产生的年月，也是波军第一师产生的年月），就一直和波军在一道行军、生活和战斗。最初他们只有二、三十个人，他们以当时波军中著名的诗人，如胜瓦尔德、瓦日克、巴斯德尔拉克和浦鲁特可夫斯基的表现战士的思想和感情的诗、剧本、歌曲开始了为部队服务，并且以爱国主义精神和苏联军队的战斗友谊经常教育战士。
    一九四三年十二月二十五日，歌舞团第一次全部以自己的节目给第二师的战士们作了愉快的演出，并且在以后在整个战斗行军中一直同他们在一起。
    在一九四四年中，歌舞团作了一系列的较大的演出，如：一月在斯摩棱斯克的演出，九月在华沙附近的冷伯尔多夫的演出。当时歌舞团已经发展到七十多个人了。
    一九四五年一月，歌舞团获得了波兰军第一军歌舞团的称号，并且以这样的名义走过了华沙、贝德哥斯区，通过波姆日防线，最后到达柏林。它是当时波军和波兰国家唯一的拥有优秀的歌唱家、音乐家和舞蹈家的大型的歌舞团。
    此后歌舞团不仅经常在华沙演出，而且到波兰最偏僻的地区，去为在营地进行训练的波军战士和在执行极为艰苦任务的波军部队演出。
    歌舞团也曾访问过捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、苏联，受到这些国家和人民的热烈欢迎和极高评价。
    由于多年来在国内外的艺术活动的成就，歌舞团在一九五一年获得了国家奖金，一九五四年获得了劳动旗帜一等勋章。
    去年——一九五四年十月十二日，我们曾经幸运地在华沙庆祝波军建军节十周年的纪念会上看到了歌舞团的表演。合唱队的演唱表现了雄伟的战斗气魄，具有极大的感人力量。请听第一军进行曲的歌词吧：
    离开家乡，来到边疆，
    你看——
    风吹柳树响，黄金染麦田，
    路不遥远。
    脱破衣，着军装，准备好，上战场；
    前进，我们第一军！…………
    等着吧！玛露霞，
    时候就来临。
    你看——
    恶魔快死亡，
    欢乐的眼泪呵，闪闪在发光，
    别哭吧！玛露霞，往日成灰烬。
    前进，我们第一军！…………
    看！多美，又多有力量呀！歌曲恰如其分地发挥了歌词的感情。
    舞蹈队在当天表演了“巴黎的火焰”的一段，同样显示了强有力的战斗气魄和高度技巧。我们都同声称赞，鼓掌不停。波兰的确是配称得起有高度文化艺术传统的国家呵！
    波军歌舞团对于中国人民解放军歌舞团的友爱和帮助，是我们不能忘记的。他们对我们的要求，完全做到了有求必应，我们需要什么教员，他们就派什么教员，要谁随团帮助，就派谁来随团帮助。歌舞团的合唱指挥马利杨·萨瓦茨基同志在紧张的工作中帮助我们排演了我们准备到苏联去演出的“党是我们的舵手”（莫拉德里作曲）；舞蹈指导为我们排了“克拉科夫”舞，歌舞团还送了我们全套服装，以便使我们赶得及在华沙的闭幕式演出中演出这个节目。他们是把我们的工作看作同他们自己的工作一样的。
    这些地方也体现出了波兰军队高度的爱国主义和国际主义的伟大精神。
    这样一个有高度政治思想和艺术水平的歌舞团访问我国，其可期的成就当然不只是文化交流方面的，更重要的是在战斗上，特别是在马克思列宁主义的思想上增进我们两国人民之间、军队之间的亲密团结。
    祝歌舞团在中国的演出获得巨大的成功！
    中波两国人民之间、军队之间战斗的思想的团结万岁！
