    The First Year of Basic Cooperativization in Alashan Township
    Shang Jiong, Lian Shan
    In Huocheng County, Xinjiang Province, near the Soviet border, the first basically cooperativized township emerged this spring. This is Alashan Township. The land here is fertile and vast, with dozens of crisscrossing canals flowing throughout the township like blood vessels in the human body. It is said that more than sixty years ago, this was still a wilderness of weeds, which was developed into fertile fields by the laboring people of six ethnic groups, including Kazakh, Xibe, Uyghur, Han, Daur, and Hui, who lived here in more than two hundred households. Now, it is being built into a new type of countryside.
    The First Spring
    From last winter to this spring, farmers of all ethnic groups in Alashan Township, under the leadership of the Party, carried out a mutual aid and cooperation movement. Influenced by the original Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the township, the enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups for mutual aid and cooperation was unprecedented, and they applied to join the cooperative and mutual aid teams one after another. The number of agricultural cooperatives in the township rapidly developed from one to five, with 120 farmer households joining the cooperatives, accounting for more than 62 percent of the total number of farmer households in the township. Together with the farmer households participating in mutual aid teams, the organized farmers in the township accounted for more than 73 percent of the total number of farmer households. In addition, a credit cooperative was established in the township in December 1954, and the district supply and marketing cooperative was also located in this township. The Communist Party is the organizer of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the township. In the course of carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the organizations of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League are also rapidly growing. The township has developed eight Party members and twenty-two League members. Thus, starting from this spring, farmers of all ethnic groups in Alashan Township embarked on the road of basic cooperativization.
    In March and April, the first spring of the basically cooperativized township arrived. At this time, it snowed heavily for several consecutive times, and the weather suddenly turned cold, freezing the thawed land again. Farmers in neighboring townships temporarily stopped spring plowing according to past habits. However, the farmers in the cooperativized township did not stop. They responded to the call of the Party, and after the Alashan Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the resounding slogan of "Overcoming Difficulties and Fighting the First Battle of Spring Plowing Well," under the leadership of the five agricultural cooperatives, farmers throughout the township launched intense spring plowing and sowing work in the harsh weather, completing the sowing of more than 12,800 mu of various spring-sown crops on time, exceeding the original spring sowing task by 3 percent. Among them, the sowing area of the five cooperatives reached more than 9,900 mu, accounting for more than 77 percent of the total sowing area of the township. The spring sowing cultivation technology has also been significantly improved compared with previous years. Farmers not only plowed the land first, then sowed, and then harrowed, but also used new-style plows and iron harrows on most of the land, thus ensuring the neat emergence and robust growth of crops.
    The farmers of the basically cooperativized Alashan Township thus won the honor for the cooperativized township for the first time. This year, Alashan Township was the only one of the twenty-one agricultural townships in Huocheng County to overfulfill the spring plowing and sowing task. Other townships failed to complete the task due to the impact of the weather. The reputation of the cooperativized township immediately spread.
    No Reduction in Production Despite Disaster
    The farmers of the cooperativized township were not satisfied with this. They knew that completing the spring plowing and sowing task only created conditions for striving for a bumper harvest this year. Therefore, after the end of spring plowing, they launched cultivation work that they had never done before. They applied more than 6,230 carts of manure to the land that had never been fertilized before for the first time. Most of the crops were weeded once or twice for the first time this year. In order to ensure the robust growth of crops, the five agricultural cooperatives also built six dams in the township this year, renovated and merged the canals, and implemented the method of watering day and night, reducing water waste. The paddy fields in the township were generally watered two to three times.
    This year, there was drought in the area due to untimely rainfall. Alashan Township also suffered serious drought and pests and diseases on more than 800 mu of dry land and some oil crops, reducing the harvest or resulting in no harvest at all. However, due to the improvement of cultivation techniques, other crops in Alashan Township, such as wheat, oats, barley, corn, and millet, have already achieved or will soon achieve a bumper harvest. It is estimated that the township can still complete or overfulfill this year's total output plan, which will increase farmers' income on the basis of 1954. Mao Dahemaiti (Kazakh), a member of the Alashan Agricultural Cooperative, harvested more than 13,000 jin of wheat when he was in the mutual aid team last year. This year, he received more than 15,000 jin of wheat alone in the agricultural cooperative. Bai Kemuhemaiti (Kazakh), a member of the cooperative, only harvested more than 1,300 jin of wheat when he worked alone last year because he cultivated less land and the harvest was not good. This year, he received 6,900 jin of wheat in the cooperative.
    Agricultural Cooperatives Drive Farmers Outside the Cooperative
    Agricultural cooperatives have become the center for driving and attracting farmers throughout the township to carry out agricultural production increase campaigns. During the spring plowing and cultivation period, the five cooperatives in the township drove and helped mutual aid teams and individual farmers to complete tasks such as sowing, weeding, and watering. During the summer and autumn harvests, they also actively helped mutual aid teams and individual farmers. When harvesting wheat, the Abulakemu perennial mutual aid team could not allocate enough labor because they planted a relatively large area, and 95 mu of wheat could not be harvested in time. The Alashan Agricultural Cooperative immediately dispatched several members to hitch horses to harvesters to help them. The individual farmer Shapu'er Ali (Kazakh) lost his wife in March this year, and there were only him and five young orphans in his family. During the summer harvest, he suffered from a serious illness, and no one could harvest the ripe wheat. He lay at home and anxiously shouted: "My wheat is finished!" But just as he was helpless, the Alashan Cooperative had already harvested all of his 7.5 mu of wheat without any compensation. When the members told him that they had helped him harvest the wheat, Shapu'er Ali shed tears of gratitude, tightly grasped the member's hand, and said: "You are even closer than my own brothers."
    Indeed, the farmers of all ethnic groups in the basically cooperativized Alashan Township are now relying on and helping each other, no longer like the individual farmers who were scattered and managed on their own, who couldn't care about each other and didn't care about each other. Now, not only are the more than 100 farmer households who have joined the cooperatives confident in running the cooperatives, but also the farmers outside the cooperatives are actively applying to join the cooperatives. They say: The sooner you join the cooperative, the sooner you can live a happy and joyful life!
    All Ethnic Groups Are As United As One Family
    Ethnic relations in the cooperativized township have been further harmonized on the original basis. Now, if you take a trip to Alashan Township, you can not only see farmers of all ethnic groups producing and working closely in one cooperative, but you can also see all ethnic groups respecting each other's customs and habits. The pigs raised by Xibe and Han farmers are all tied up or kept in pens; the livestock of farmers of other ethnic groups are also not running around everywhere. In the past, ethnic groups rarely visited each other during festivals, but now they congratulate each other. During the Spring Festival this year, Xibe, Han, and Daur farmers specially made halal meals to entertain Kazakh, Uyghur, and Hui farmers who believed in Islam.
    This spring, more than 30 urban poor households moved from Yining City to Alashan Township. Most of them are Uyghur. As soon as they arrived in Alashan Township, they were welcomed by farmers throughout the township, especially the members of the agricultural cooperative. In order to help them quickly establish their households, the agricultural cooperative absorbed them into the cooperative. At that time, they had no houses to live in, no draft animals, no farm tools, and some even lacked food for a short period of time. Under this circumstance, the members of the five cooperatives in the township tried their best to help them. Some members saved money and food, and helped these urban poor to overcome temporary difficulties. In production, they did not know how to cultivate the land, weed, or water, so the old members enthusiastically and patiently taught them every production technique until they fully learned it. Under the agricultural cooperative's meticulous care, help, and attention, these urban poor are now living better than before, and more than 20 people are already familiar with various crop activities. Some urban poor who were originally not very comfortable with agricultural production are now determined to work hard and create a happy and fulfilling life together with the old members.

    阿拉山乡基本合作化的第一年
    尚炯　练善
    在新疆省靠近苏联边境的霍城县，今年春天出现了第一个基本合作化的乡，这就是阿拉山乡。这里的土地肥沃而广阔，数十条纵横的渠道，像人体上的血脉一样流贯全乡。据说，六十多年以前，这里还是一片荒草滩，是居住在这里的二百多户哈萨克、锡伯、维吾尔、汉、达呼尔、回等六个民族的劳动人民，用自己的双手把它开拓成肥沃的良田的。现在，它正被建设成为一个新型的乡村。
    第一个春天
    从去年冬天到今年春天，阿拉山乡各族农民在党的领导下，开展了互助合作运动。由于受了乡里原有的红光农业生产合作社的影响，各族农民互助合作的积极性空前高涨，纷纷要求入社、入组。全乡农业合作社迅速由一个发展到了五个，入社农民有一百二十户，达到全乡农户总数的百分之六十二以上，加上参加互助组的农户，全乡组织起来的农民已占农户总数的百分之七十三强。此外，乡上还在一九五四年十二月建立了一个信用合作社，区供销合作社也设在这个乡里。共产党是全乡互助合作运动的组织者。在开展互助合作运动中，共产党和青年团的组织也在迅速壮大。全乡发展了党员八名，团员二十二名。这样，从今年春天开始，阿拉山乡的各族农民就走上了基本合作化的道路。
    三、四月间，基本合作化乡的第一个春天到来了。就在这时候，一连下了几场大雪，天气突然变冷，解冻了的土地又冻结了。邻乡的农民根据过去的习惯，都暂时停止了春耕工作。但是合作化乡的农民没有停止。他们响应了党的号召，在中共阿拉山乡支部提出“战胜困难，打好春耕第一仗”的响亮口号以后，在五个农业合作社的带动下，全乡农民在严寒的气候里，展开了紧张的春耕播种工作，使全乡一万二千八百多亩各种春播作物，适时完成播种，超过了原定春播任务的百分之三。其中，五个社的播种面积就达九千九百多亩，占全乡总播种面积的百分之七十七强。春播的耕作技术，也较往年有了显著的改进，农民不仅做到了先犁地后播种再耙耱，而且绝大部分土地都是用新式犁犁过后用铁耙耙的，因此，保证了庄稼齐整出苗和健壮成长。
    基本合作化的阿拉山乡的农民，就这样第一次为合作化乡赢得了荣誉。今年霍城县的二十一个农业乡中，唯有阿拉山乡超额完成了春耕播种任务，其他各乡由于气候的影响都没有完成任务。合作化乡的名声立刻传播出去了。
      受灾不减产
    合作化乡的农民并没有因此满足。他们知道完成春耕播种任务，只是为今年争取丰收创造了条件，因而当春耕结束后，他们便又展开了过去从来没有做过的中耕工作。他们第一次在从来没有上过粪肥的土地上施了六千二百三十多车粪肥。绝大部分庄稼今年都破例地拔了一遍到两遍草。为了保证作物的健壮生长，五个农业合作社今年还修筑了全乡的六处水坝，整修和裁并了渠道，实行了昼夜浇水的方法，减少了水的浪费，全乡的水田一般都浇了两遍到三遍水。
    今年，当地因天雨不及时而有旱情，阿拉山乡也有八百多亩旱田和一些油料作物遭受严重的旱灾和病虫害，减少了收成或全无收成。但由于耕作技术的改进，阿拉山乡其他作物如小麦、燕麦、大麦、玉米、谷子等都已经或即将获得丰收。估计全乡仍可完成或超额完成今年的总产量计划，将使农民的收入在一九五四年的基础上有所增加。阿拉山农业合作社社员毛达合买提（哈萨克族）去年在互助组时，收了一万三千多斤小麦，今年在农业合作社里仅小麦他就分了一万五千多斤。社员白克木合买提（哈萨克族）去年单干时，因为种的地少，收成也不好，因而只收了一千三百多斤小麦，今年在社里就分到了六千九百多斤小麦。
    农业合作社带动了社外农民
    农业合作社已经成了带动和吸引全乡农民开展农业增产运动的中心。全乡五个社在春耕和中耕时期，带动和帮助互助组和单干农民完成了播种、除草、浇水等任务。在夏收和秋收中，又积极帮助了互助组和单干农民。收割小麦时，阿不拉克木常年互助组因为种得比较多，劳动力调派不开，有九十五亩小麦无法及时收割。阿拉山农业合作社立即抽出几个社员套上马拉收割机去帮助他们。单干农民沙甫尔阿里（哈萨克族），今年三月间妻子死了，家里只有他和五个幼小的孤儿。夏收中，他又害了重病，黄熟的麦子无人去收。他躺在家里着急地喊：“我的麦子完蛋了！”但是正当他束手无策的时候，阿拉山社已经无代价地把他的七亩半小麦全部收割回来了。当社员告诉他已经帮助他把小麦收割回来了时，沙甫尔阿里流着感激的眼泪，紧紧地握着社员的手说：“你们真比我的亲兄弟还亲。”
    的确，基本合作化的阿拉山乡的各族农民，现在是互相依靠、互相帮助了，不再像分散经营时的个体农民那样，谁也顾不了谁，谁也不顾谁。现在，不只是已入社的一百多户农民的办社信心都很坚定，就是社外农民也在积极地要求入社。他们说：早入社，就可以早过幸福愉快的生活！
    各族人民团结得像一家人
    合作化乡的民族关系已经在原有基础上进一步融洽起来。现在，如果你在阿拉山乡转一趟，你不光是能看到各民族农民在一个社内亲密无间地生产和工作，而且你也能看到各民族互相尊重风俗习惯。锡伯族和汉族农民养的猪，都被拴起来或关在圈里；其他民族农民的牲畜也没有到处乱跑的现象。过去，各民族逢年过节，彼此多不往来，现在却是互相祝贺了。今年春节时期，锡伯族、汉族和达呼尔族农民还特意做了清真饭，招待信奉伊斯兰教的哈萨克族、维吾尔族和回族的农民。
    今年春天，有三十多户城市贫民从伊宁市搬到了阿拉山乡。其中，绝大部分是维吾尔族。他们一到阿拉山乡，就受到了全乡农民特别是农业合作社社员的欢迎。为了帮助他们迅速建立家务，农业合作社便把他们分别吸收到社里。当时，他们既没有房子住，也没有耕畜、农具，有些人甚至连短时期的口粮也很缺乏。在这种情况下，全乡五个社的社员便尽力帮助他们。有些社员省吃俭用，把粮食和钱节余下来，帮助这些城市贫民度过暂时的困难。在生产中，他们不会种地、除草和浇水，老社员们便热情地耐心地教给他们每一项生产技术，直到他们完全学会为止。在农业合作社无微不至的关怀、帮助和照顾下，现在这些城市贫民生活上都比以前过得好，有二十几个人已经熟悉各种庄稼活儿了。有些原来不大安心农业生产的城市贫民，现在也决心努力劳动，同老社员一道共同创造幸福美满的生活。
