Youth Shock Brigades Play a Huge Role in Railway Construction

　　In various important projects of newly built railways across the country, youth shock brigades have played a huge role. According to current incomplete statistics, 102 youth shock brigades have been established on the Baocheng Railway, the Lanxin Railway, the Jier Line, and the Fengsha Line, as well as the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and other construction sites, with a total of more than 5,000 members. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, these youth shock brigades have motivated the broad masses of workers, overcome many difficulties, and successfully completed their tasks. The Youth Shock Team at the northern entrance of the Qinling Tunnel on the Baocheng Railway increased the daily excavation progress from 1.4 meters to 2.7 meters, accelerating the time to open up the Qinling Mountains. The Guo Zhiying Youth Shock Brigade on the Fengsha Line opened up Tunnel No. 7 half a month ahead of schedule, and then opened up Tunnel No. 4, which was made of extra-hard rock, one month ahead of schedule, and took the lead in overcoming the arduous task of Shijingshan, the fifth key project.

　　Youth shock brigades have not only achieved outstanding results in production, but also constantly improved the political consciousness and technical level of their members. Among the 440 members of the five youth shock brigades on the Lanxin Railway and the Lanyin section of the Baolan Railway, 14 joined the Party and 50 joined the League after the team was formed. After half a year of study by the Youth Shock Brigade of the 16th Engineering Area of the Lanxin Railway, 16 of the 22 ordinary workers have passed the examination and reached the standard of third-grade concrete workers.

　　Youth shock brigades have set a good example for the broad masses of young people and workers in the new railway construction projects, and have been praised by the masses and commended by the leadership. Many youth shock brigades have been rated as advanced collective units or collective model units.

    青年突击队在铁路建设中发挥了巨大作用
    在全国新建铁路的各个重要工程中，青年突击队发挥了巨大作用。据目前不完全统计，在宝成路、兰新路、集二线和丰沙线，以及武汉长江大桥等工地上，已经建立了一百零二个青年突击队，共有队员五千多人。这些青年突击队在共产党和青年团的领导下，带动广大工人群众，战胜了许多困难，出色地完成了任务。宝成路秦岭隧道北口青年突击班，每天开挖进度由一点四公尺提高到二点七公尺，加速了打通秦岭的时间。丰沙线郭志英青年突击队提前半个月打通了七号隧道，又提前一个月打通了特坚石的四号隧道，并带头战胜第五个关键性工程石景山的艰巨任务。
    青年突击队不仅在生产上取得了优异成绩，队员们的政治觉悟和技术水平也在不断提高。兰新路和包兰路兰银段五个青年突击队的四百四十名队员，成立队以后入党的有十四人，入团的有五十人。兰新路十六工区青年突击队经过半年的学习，在二十二名普通工中，经过考试已经有十六人达到三级混凝土工的标准。
    青年突击队在新建铁路工程中给广大青年和职工群众树立了良好榜样，受到群众的称赞和领导上的表扬。不少青年突击队被评为集体先进单位或集体模范单位。
