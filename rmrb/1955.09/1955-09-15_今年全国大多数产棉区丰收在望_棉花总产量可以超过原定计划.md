Xinhua News Agency, September 14th. This year, a good harvest is expected in most cotton-producing areas across the country, and it is estimated that the total cotton production will exceed the original plan. Looking at ten major cotton-producing provinces, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Liaoning can all overfulfill their production increase tasks, Sichuan Province can fulfill its production increase task, while Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces will experience reduced production due to severe drought. In addition, provinces and cities such as Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Hunan, Gansu, Shanghai, and Beijing can also fulfill or overfulfill their production increase tasks.

The unit area yield of cotton has also increased in many cotton-producing areas. In Hebei Province, except for Handan and Xingtai prefectures which suffered from drought, and Tianjin prefecture which suffered from flooding, the unit area yield of cotton in other prefectures can exceed that of last year. In Henan Province, more than 400,000 mu of paddy cotton in Anyang Prefecture can yield an average of 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu, exceeding the original plan; in the Yudong Plain, the cotton in Chenliu, Xingyang, Gongxian, and Suixian counties yields an average of 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu, also exceeding the original plan. In Jiangsu Province, each prefecture can generally yield 30 to 35 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and good ones can yield 40 jin. In Cixi County, Zhejiang, the average yield of cotton is 50 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Although Shaanxi Province suffered from drought, the 1 million mu of paddy cotton in the Guanzhong Plain can yield an average of 70 jin of ginned cotton per mu, of which the 150,000 mu of paddy cotton in Chang'an County and the suburbs of Xi'an City can yield an average of more than 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and the yield of 100,000 mu of paddy cotton in the Luohe Canal irrigation area can increase by 20% compared with last year.

The reason why cotton production is so good this year, in addition to the favorable weather in most cotton-producing areas, is mainly because the peasants have a high enthusiasm for increasing cotton production to support the country's industrial construction. Due to the further development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in various cotton-producing areas, and the implementation of the state's "three fix" policy for grain and various policies related to rewarding cotton planting, the national cotton planting area exceeded the original plan by more than 1.5 million mu. There have been many improvements and advancements in cotton planting techniques in various regions. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Anhui provinces, more than 710,000 peasants have received instruction in cotton planting techniques. Under their leadership, peasants in various regions have adopted improved varieties, implemented close planting, increased fertilizer application, prevented and controlled pests, trimmed branches and nipped side shoots, and strived for a good cotton harvest. The national area of improved cotton varieties has expanded by 9 million mu compared with last year; among them, in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces alone, 4 million mu of cotton fields have been converted from planting coarse-staple cotton to fine-staple cotton, which is estimated to increase the production of ginned cotton by 200,000 dan. Generally, various regions can prevent and control cotton pests in a timely manner. Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces have established red bollworm-free demonstration areas in areas flooded last year, sown cotton seeds fumigated with medicinal agents, and strengthened daily prevention and control work, so the main cotton pest, the red bollworm, has rarely occurred.

The state has given great support to the peasants in cotton-producing areas. This year, the national pre-purchase of cotton paid a deposit of more than 140 million yuan to the peasants, and supplied more grain, cotton cloth, fertilizer, and other materials to the peasants who pre-sold more cotton. In order to solve the shortage of seeds in disaster areas and expand the cotton fields, the country transferred and supplied 400 million jin of cotton seeds to the peasants, more than double the amount in previous years. The state supplied more than 20,000 tons of pesticides for pest control to various cotton-producing areas, an increase of 1.5 times compared with last year, and paid attention to the demonstration and promotion of high-efficiency pest control equipment such as changing single-tube sprayers to double-tube sprayers, as well as chicken feather brush powdering machines, animal-powered sprayers and powderers. The supply of chemical fertilizers to cotton-producing areas reached 133,000 tons, an increase of one time compared with last year. In addition, various cotton-producing areas have also vigorously promoted new agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-share plows and animal-powered three-tooth cultivators.

This year, cotton in many areas began to fluff in early and mid-August, one or two weeks earlier than in previous years. At present, peasants in various regions have finished picking the first flush of cotton and are picking the middle flush of cotton.

### 今年全国大多数产棉区丰收在望  棉花总产量可以超过原定计划

    今年全国大多数产棉区丰收在望
    棉花总产量可以超过原定计划
    新华社十四日讯　今年全国大多数产棉区可望丰收，估计棉花总产量将超过原定计划。从十个主要产棉省来看，河北、山东、江苏、河南、湖北、安徽、辽宁七省都可以超额完成增产任务，四川省可以完成增产任务，山西、陕西两省因受旱较重而减产。此外，新疆、浙江、湖南、甘肃、上海、北京等省、市也都可以完成或超额完成增产任务。
    许多产棉区棉花的单位面积产量也提高了。河北省除邯郸、邢台两专区受旱，天津专区受涝外，其他专区的棉花单位面积产量都可以超过去年。河南省安阳专区四十多万亩水地棉花，平均每亩可收皮棉六十斤，超过原定计划；豫东平原陈留、荥阳、巩县、睢县等县的棉花，每亩平均产量为皮棉四十斤，也都超过原定计划。江苏省各专区一般每亩可收皮棉三十到三十五斤，好的可收四十斤。浙江慈谿县的棉花平均每亩可收五十斤皮棉。陕西省虽然受到干旱，但关中平原一百多万亩水地棉花平均每亩可收皮棉七十斤，其中长安县和西安市郊区的十五万亩水地棉花平均每亩可收皮棉八十斤以上，洛惠渠灌溉区的十万亩水地棉花每亩产量可比去年提高百分之二十。
    今年棉花生产所以这样好，除了大多数产棉区风调雨顺以外，主要是因为农民增产棉花支援国家工业建设的热情高涨。由于各产棉区农业合作化运动进一步的发展，以及国家粮食“三定”政策和有关奖励植棉的各项政策的贯彻，全国棉花播种面积超过原定计划一百五十多万亩。各地在植棉技术上都有不少改进和提高。据河北、山东、河南、陕西、湖北、湖南、四川、安徽八省的不完全统计，受到植棉技术传授的农民有七十一万多人。在他们的带动下，各地农民纷纷采用良种，实行密植，增施肥料，防治虫害，整枝打杈，力争棉花丰收。全国良种棉田比去年扩大九百万亩；其中仅江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、湖北、湖南等省四百万亩棉田将粗绒棉改种细绒棉，估计就可以增产皮棉二十万担。对棉花虫害，各地一般都能及时防治。湖北、江西等省在去年被淹过的地区建立无红铃虫示范区，播种了用药剂熏蒸过的棉籽，并加强了日常的防治工作，棉花主要的害虫红铃虫已很少发生。
    国家对产棉区农民给以巨大的支援。今年全国预购棉花付给农民的定金有一亿四千多万元，并对多预售棉花的农民多供应了粮食、棉布、肥料等物资。为解决灾区缺种和扩大棉田所需的种籽，全国调运供应农民棉种四亿斤，超过往年一倍。国家供应各产棉区治虫农药二万多吨，比去年增加一点五倍，并注意了改单管喷雾器为双管喷雾器，以及鸡毛刷粉车、畜力喷雾器和喷粉器等高效率治虫器械的示范推广。对产棉区化学肥料的供应量达十三万三千吨，比去年增加一倍。此外，各产棉区还大力推广了双轮双铧犁、畜力三齿耘锄等新式农具。
    今年许多地区的棉花在八月上、中旬就开始吐絮，比往年提早了一、二十天。目前，各地农民已经把头喷花拾完，正在拾中喷花。
