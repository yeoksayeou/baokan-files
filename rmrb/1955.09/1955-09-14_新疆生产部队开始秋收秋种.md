The Xinjiang Agricultural Production Corps is comprehensively carrying out the autumn harvest and planting. This year, the total harvest area of autumn crops of the Corps is more than 668,000 mu (including cotton, rice, miscellaneous grains, oil crops, beans, etc.), accounting for 67.3 percent of the total sown area. After the summer harvest, the soldiers assembled machines and repaired tools to prepare for the autumn harvest. At present, in addition to dispatching 28 "Skharm-48" cotton pickers to pick cotton, they are also using ten newly imported Soviet corn harvesters for trial corn harvesting. All regions have also launched labor competitions, and the soldiers have expressed that they will harvest carefully and thoroughly, and harvest more grain and cotton to support the country's industrial construction. At the same time, the Corps is planting more than 400,000 mu of winter wheat. Most of these more than 400,000 mu of winter wheat land has undergone summer fallow plowing and base fertilizer application before sowing. Some of the newly reclaimed wasteland this year has been scientifically planned in accordance with advanced Soviet experience. All seeds are excellent varieties that have been carefully selected and treated with pesticides. According to the different climates of various regions in Xinjiang, sowing began in early September, dispatching more than 150 tractors of various types. Sowing can be completed in most areas by mid-September.

    新疆生产部队开始秋收秋种
    新疆农业生产部队正在全面进行秋收秋播。今年部队秋季农作物的总收获面积有六十六万八千多亩（包括棉花、水稻、杂粮、油料、豆类等作物），占总播种面积百分之六十七点三。在夏收结束后，战士们就装配机器修整工具，准备秋收。目前除出动二十八台斯哈姆四十八型采棉机收摘棉花外，并采用了新近从苏联进口的玉米收割机十台试割玉米。各地并开展了劳动竞赛，战士们表示要细打细收，多收粮食和棉花，支援祖国工业建设。与此同时，部队正在播种四十余万亩冬麦。这四十多万亩冬麦地，大部进行了播前伏耕和施基肥。其中一部分今年新开垦的荒地，按照苏联先进经验进行了科学的规划。全部种子是经过精选和药剂处理的优良品种。根据新疆各地区气候的不同，九月初旬先后开始播种，出动各种类型的拖拉机一百五十余台。大部地区在九月中旬可以播种完毕。
