Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 28th. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu's speech to the members of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma was published on the 26th.
	In his speech, U Nu made special mention of the relationship between Burma and China. He said, "I believe that the relationship between China and Burma, and the mutual understanding between China and Burma, have improved significantly since Premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma and later I visited China and discussed common issues with the Chinese leaders. I believe that, for the sake of common interests, our two countries have not only taken coordinated actions in economic, cultural, and social issues, but also made joint efforts in defending universal peace."
	U Nu also expressed confidence in the current friendly ties between Burma and India. He said that the people of the two countries have deep friendship with each other. He thanked India for its assistance when Burma encountered difficulties. He said that last year India agreed to purchase 900,000 tons of rice from Burma according to the conditions proposed by Burma, and now India has agreed to Burma's request for financial assistance. He said that the reason why Burma asked India for help in times of difficulty was because of the solid friendship between the two countries.

    缅甸总理吴努谈中缅和缅印友好关系
    新华社二十八日讯　仰光消息：缅甸总理吴努对缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟国会议员的演说词已经在二十六日发表。
    吴努在演说中特别提到缅甸和中国的关系。他说：“我认为中缅两国的关系和中缅两国之间的相互了解，从周恩来总理访问了缅甸和后来我访问中国并且同中国的领袖们讨论了共同问题之后，有了显著的改善。我相信，我们两国为了共同的利益，不仅在经济、文化和社会问题方面采取了协调一致的行动，而且也在保卫普遍和平方面进行了共同的努力。”
    吴努还表示对目前缅甸和印度的友好联系具有信心。他说，两国人民彼此具有深厚的友谊。他感谢印度在缅甸遇到困难时给予的帮助。他说，去年印度同意根据缅甸建议的条件向缅甸购买九十万吨大米，现在印度又答应了缅甸希望得到财政援助的要求。他说，缅甸在困难的时候向印度请求帮助的原因是由于两国之间存在着坚固的友谊。
