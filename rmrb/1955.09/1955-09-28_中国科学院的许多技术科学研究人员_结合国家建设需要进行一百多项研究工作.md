Many technical science researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in conjunction with the urgent needs of national construction, are cooperating with industrial departments and universities to carry out more than one hundred research projects.

To support the construction of the new steel bases in Baotou and Wuhan, metallurgists and young scientific workers are studying the ore dressing and smelting methods for the iron ores in these two locations, as well as refractory materials. Scientific workers at the Petroleum Institute are studying the synthesis of petroleum using fluidization methods (i.e., artificial petroleum) to find economical and effective production routes. To rationally utilize petroleum resources, they are conducting component analysis and evaluation of natural petroleum and shale oil and providing scientific data for newly built oil refineries. Coal research workers are conducting evaluation, analysis, and identification work on coalfields across the country, formulating a national coal classification plan to provide a scientific basis for the rational and economical utilization of coal resources. This is a central task for the Coal Research Office at present. In addition, research institutions in the technical science sector are also studying earthquake-resistant building structures, series capacitor transmission, long-distance measurement and control of power systems, and the manufacture of optical instruments, among other important topics.

Since the Chinese Academy of Sciences began conducting research according to plan in 1953, approximately 60 percent of the research projects have been commissioned by government industrial departments and carried out according to their needs. Many of these have yielded good results. For example, the research on blast furnace bricks, essential for the iron and steel industry, has not only achieved ideal main performance indicators (compressive strength, etc.) but can also increase daily output by about 30 percent, which is very helpful in extending the life of blast furnaces. The scientific workers engaged in this research have therefore been rewarded by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A recent research achievement by scientific workers at the Yumen Oilfield provides a strong guarantee for increasing the oil production and quality of the Yumen Oilfield. Crude oil from the Yumen oil wells often contains a large amount of salt water, which is difficult to separate. Therefore, during refining, it corrodes production equipment and affects the quality of heavy oil and asphalt. This salt-water-containing crude oil also poses many difficulties in storage and transportation. Now, petroleum researchers, in close cooperation with producers, have solved this problem that could not be solved for many years—the problem of crude oil desalting and dewatering. Other contributions have been made to the research and manufacture of new industrial products such as the 50-ton universal material testing machine, various precision optical instruments and other precision instruments and machinery, bronze oil-containing bearings; the smelting of tungsten alloys and the ore dressing research of non-ferrous metals in the electrical industry; the extraction of rare metals; nodular cast iron and its processing, and so on.

Since 1954, research units in the field of technical science have frequently sent more than a dozen research groups to factories and mines to work, including well-known metallurgists, metal physicists, and chemical experts.

    中国科学院的许多技术科学研究人员
    结合国家建设需要进行一百多项研究工作
    中国科学院的许多技术科学研究人员正结合国家建设的迫切需要，同产业部门、高等学校合作，进行一百多个项目的研究工作。
    配合包头、武汉两个新的钢铁基地的建设，冶金学家和年轻的科学工作者正在研究上述两地铁矿的选矿、冶炼方法以及耐火材料。石油研究所的科学工作者正在研究用流体化方法合成石油（即人造石油），以寻求经济有效的生产途径；为合理利用石油资源，他们正进行着天然石油、页岩油的成份分析评价的工作，并为新建炼油厂提供科学数据。煤炭研究工作者正对全国煤田进行评价、分析和鉴定工作，制定全国煤的分类方案，为合理而经济地利用煤炭资源提出科学的依据。这是煤炭研究室当前的一项中心工作。此外，技术科学部门的研究机构还在研究耐地震的建筑结构，串联电容器输电、电力系统远距离测量和操纵以及光学仪器制造等不少重要课题。
    中国科学院自从一九五三年开始按计划进行研究以来，大约有百分之六十的研究项目是接受政府产业部门的委托和根据他们的需要进行的。其中许多已得出了较好的结果。例如对炼铁工业中必需的高炉砖的研究，不但使成品的主要指标（耐压强度等）都达到了理想目标，而且可提高日产量百分之三十左右，对延长高炉寿命也很有帮助。从事这项研究的科学工作者因此得到了重工业部和中国科学院的奖励。在玉门油矿的科学工作者新近获得的一项研究成果，对提高玉门油矿的石油产量和质量提供了有力的保证。玉门原油自油井中开采出来时经常含有大量盐水，难以分离，因此在制炼时要腐蚀生产设备、影响重油和沥青的品质，这种含盐水的原油在贮存和运输方面也有很多困难。现在石油研究者在生产者的密切配合下解决了这个多年来不能解决的问题——原油脱盐脱水问题。其他如对五十吨万能材料试验机、多种精密光学仪器以及其他精密仪器和机械、青铜含油轴承等工业新产品的研究制造；电气工业上的钨合金冶炼和有色金属的选矿研究；稀有金属的提炼；球墨铸铁及其加工等等，都有贡献。
    从一九五四年以来，技术科学方面各研究单位经常派出十多个研究小组去厂矿工作，其中有著名的冶金学家、金属物理学家、化工专家等。
