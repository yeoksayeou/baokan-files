How Chengjiachuan Village is Piloting Overall Planning for Cooperativization
    Han Fuwang, Guo Zengji
    In 1953, Chengjiachuan Village, Wulihou Township, Luan County, Shanxi Province, established an agricultural production cooperative. The number of member households has now grown to 72, accounting for 30.3% of the village's total households. The cooperative has achieved increased production for two consecutive years, and the vast majority of farmers are actively and enthusiastically requesting to join. Last autumn, out of the village's 22 mutual aid teams, 12 proposed to transform into cooperatives, with over 90 households registering and firmly demanding to join. However, during the expansion of the cooperative, only 52 households were absorbed from nine teams, leaving the remaining 40-plus households out. These households complained, "It's pushed off year after year, and we never make the list." Some mutual aid teams bluntly stated, "We're actively preparing, and we will definitely establish a cooperative next year. We'll build it whether it's approved or not!" The leadership failed to adapt to this new situation and strengthen leadership in a timely manner, instead adopting a passive and defensive attitude. Because they didn't have a clear picture beforehand, they blindly absorbed members during the cooperative's expansion. Some households that actively requested to join were refused, while some households that were not very willing to join were "dragged" in, affecting the cooperative's consolidation. More seriously, they blindly concentrated key personnel, undermining many mutual aid teams. For example, Wang Qiude's team had 18 households, all of whom applied to join the cooperative last year, but the cooperative only took five, including two Party members and one Youth League member. The remaining 13 households only had one Youth League member as a backbone. After most of the key personnel of some teams were taken away, the leadership didn't help with timely rectification. Some of the remaining households then forcefully joined with others, forming new teams. Some teams concentrated three or four key personnel, while others lacked key personnel, draught animals, and farm tools, making it impossible to carry out mutual aid production. Thus, there emerged "rich teams," "poor teams," "backbone teams," and "collapsed teams." Under these circumstances, some wealthy households seized the opportunity to win over struggling households with "mutual aid," sometimes exchanging one of their animal labor days for six of the struggling households' labor days. Zhao Quangui, a newly emerging middle peasant, entrusted his 28 mu of land to the team, only paying a wage of just over 70 yuan a year. He himself drove a rubber-wheeled cart to earn money outside, saying, "You (struggling households) produce the same in our team, why bother joining the cooperative and making trouble!"
    In light of this situation, in mid-August of this year, the work team of the CPC Changzhi Prefectural Committee piloted an overall plan for cooperativization in this village.
    The main contents of the plan are: how to consolidate and improve the old cooperative; how to establish new cooperatives, and how many; which masses and which key personnel will participate in which cooperative and which team; which teams will establish cooperatives this year, and which teams can be considered for cooperative expansion next year. This concrete plan is to realize the principle of "prepare a batch, develop a batch; build cooperatives while consolidating." The specific steps and practices are as follows:
    First, understand the situation and formulate a plan. According to a preliminary analysis, the current class situation of this village is: The village currently has 238 households, of which two are poor peasants, accounting for 0.8% of the total households; 162 are new middle peasants, accounting for 68% of the total households (of which 140 are lower-middle peasants, accounting for more than 58% of the total households); 69 are old middle peasants, accounting for 29% of the total households (of which 14 are lower-middle peasants, accounting for 5.8% of the total households); and five are landlords and rich peasants, accounting for 2% of the total households. Currently, in addition to the 72 households that have already joined the cooperative, the village still has 14 mutual aid teams with a total of 153 households, and only 13 individual farmers. Among these households, the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants are even more eager to join the cooperative. Based on this situation, the work team and the Party branch committee formulated a preliminary plan for cooperativization, which was discussed at the branch general meeting. On the one hand, the Party members were educated to clearly recognize the new situation in which farmers were actively requesting to join the cooperative, encouraging the Party members' enthusiasm to lead the farmers on the road of cooperativization. On the other hand, targeting the right-leaning conservative thinking of some Party members who lacked class consciousness, excessively exaggerated the shortcomings of the cooperative, and believed that it was difficult to develop more cooperatives, the Party members and activists were organized to discuss and educated with the specific facts such as the superiority of the agricultural cooperative in this village and the enthusiasm of the farmers for the cooperative. In particular, the erroneous argument of Party member Guo Baoqing that "joining the cooperative is not free, suffers foreign crimes, and cannot earn money" was discussed, thereby improving the Party members' class consciousness. Wang Gou said, "With the active enthusiasm of the broad masses and the correct policies of the Party, we will definitely be able to move towards socialism. In the past, my mind was unclear, I lacked confidence, and I fell behind." Guo Dongwang, the Party branch secretary, said, "With a clear understanding of the situation, the work has a direction and is happy to do." The Party members' thoughts tended to be consistent, and the plan was approved.
    Second, fully mobilize the masses and base the plan on the masses' conscious voluntariness. The Party branch had previously understood the attitudes of various classes towards cooperativization, and then convened a mass meeting of the entire village. Through summarizing the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, a vivid contrast education of the two roads was carried out, further clarifying the purpose of building cooperatives and the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, allowing everyone to discuss it. Many farmers said, "We will resolutely follow the Communist Party on the road of cooperativization." After the meeting, the masses held family meetings to discuss joining the cooperative. From the perspective of the 166 households outside the cooperative's attitude towards cooperativization, they can be divided into the following categories: The first category, seeing the superiority of agricultural cooperatives and believing in the future of socialism, actively requested to join after the mobilization of the meeting, accounting for about 70%, the vast majority of whom are poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among new and old middle peasants. There are also some struggling households who worry that others will not want them, fearing that they will not be taken care of after joining the cooperative, and fearing that they will not be able to afford the funds. Cheng Maichen, a lower-middle peasant among new middle peasants, mobilized his 70-year-old grandmother to join the cooperative after the meeting. The old woman happily said, "As long as the cooperative wants us, you go and sign up quickly." The second category is willing to join the cooperative but not so urgently, saying that they can join or not. Some show hesitation and wavering, being afraid of everything. Although some also signed up to join the cooperative, their motives are not pure. This type of household accounts for about 20%, mostly old middle peasants and a part of upper-middle peasants among new middle peasants. For example, Zhao Honghai, an old middle peasant, went to the mutual aid team leader to sign up to join the cooperative one day, but the next morning he went to the village staff and said, "Hearing that everyone else has signed up, I felt that it would not look good if I didn't sign up, so I also registered, but in my heart, I wanted to join the cooperative next year." The third category is that they have sufficient means of production, strong personnel, and a wealthy life. They have many concerns about cooperativization, fearing that they will suffer losses, not be free, and that struggling households will take advantage of them. This type of household accounts for about 10%. The vast majority of them are old upper-middle peasants and wealthy households of some new upper-middle peasants, showing that they will delay as much as possible and prepare to wait for another two or three years. For example, Wang Fugou, an old upper-middle peasant, said, "I have carts, livestock, and 18 mu of good land. As long as the policy allows individual farming, I will wait two or three years before considering it." Every household in the village held a family meeting, each choosing their own path. After two days of deliberation, 114 households in the entire village voluntarily signed up to join the cooperative, exceeding the original estimate of the branch.
    Third, promptly review, revise, and announce the plan. While the masses were deliberating and applying to join the cooperative, the Party branch, based on the principle of "actively leading and advancing steadily," in addition to mobilizing Party members to deeply understand the true thoughts of various classes, also held various small symposiums in a planned and targeted manner, using the viewpoint of class analysis to understand their attitude towards joining the cooperative. The branch correctly determined the household ranking of those who signed up to join the cooperative, and promptly announced the results of the plan to the masses, which was approved after democratic discussion. Of the 114 households who signed up to join the cooperative this year, except for the persuasion of Shen Qun, only seven key personnel of the mutual aid team still lead their respective mutual aid teams, and 17 households with ideological disagreements and relatively wealthy lives who are unwilling to join the cooperative for the time being are temporarily left outside the cooperative, and two landlord and rich peasant households are not absorbed. A total of 88 households joined the cooperative this year, building three new cooperatives. Three new mutual aid teams were also established. The three newly built cooperatives have initially set up a framework. On the one hand, they are actively leading to do a good job in production, and on the other hand, they are starting to consider the things that the newly built cooperatives should do. Everyone unanimously believes that this method is really good. The order of who comes first and who comes later is ranked, every household has a bottom line, everyone's mind is clear, and the cooperative will definitely be run well.
    As a result of the combination of the Party branch's leadership and the masses' voluntariness in carrying out overall planning, the bias of excluding poor households from joining the cooperative has been corrected, the problem of excessive concentration of key personnel has been resolved, and the relationship between the cooperative and the team has been closer. By 1956, there will be a total of four cooperatives in the village, with 160 member households, accounting for 67% of the total households. In 1957, another 45 households will be developed, and the number of member households will reach 205, accounting for about 86% of the total households, and the entire village can be cooperativized. There are still 33 households left outside the cooperative. The vast majority of them are new upper-middle peasants and old upper-middle peasants, as well as landlords and rich peasants.
    From the pilot in Chengjiachuan Village, it is realized that the following points must be paid attention to in implementing the overall planning of cooperativization: First, rely closely on the Party branch and give play to the Party's leading role. First of all, Party members and cadres must clearly recognize the new situation that has emerged under the new situation, understand the inevitability of the great development of the cooperativization movement, and make the Party's leadership ahead of the movement. Then, on this basis, carry out cooperative education and policy education widely and comprehensively, and constantly improve revolutionary vigilance to strictly prevent sabotage by reactionary rich peasants and other bad elements. Second, correctly implement the Party's class line. Understand the ideological attitudes of various classes in depth, and analyze and study them specifically. Clearly recognize who are the activists in taking the socialist road, the main force of cooperativization, and the objects we rely on; who hold a negative and perfunctory attitude towards socialism and cannot be relied on. We must think deeply and plan ahead, take the overall situation into account, and see the new cooperatives being established, as well as the old cooperatives; take into account the consolidation and improvement of the old cooperatives, as well as the establishment and development of the new cooperatives; run the existing cooperatives well, and also pay attention to the mutual aid teams. Third, implement the mass line working method of combining leadership with the masses, fully cultivate and use activists, explain the policies clearly, calculate the advantages and disadvantages, and let the masses fully deliberate and discuss, so that they can do it themselves. The scale and speed of the movement should be based on specific conditions, and never rely solely on the enthusiasm of a few staff members.

    成家川村是怎样试行合作化全面规划的
    韩福旺　郭增基
    山西省潞安县五里后乡成家川村一九五三年建立了一个农业生产合作社，入社农户现已发展到七十二户，占全村总农户的百分之三十点三。这个社两年来都获得增产，广大农民积极热情地要求入社。去年秋季，全村二十二个互助组，即有十二个组提出转社，其中报名挂号坚决要求入社的有九十多户。但在扩社时，只从九个组内吸收了五十二户入社，把其余的四十多户都甩在外边。这些户不满地说：“一年推一年，年年不上榜。”有的互助组干脆提出“我们积极准备，明年一定要建社，到那时批准也建，不批准也建！”领导上未能适应这个新情况及时加强领导，而是采取了消极应付和被动招架的态度。由于事先心中无数，扩社时盲目吸收社员，有些积极要求的户被拒绝在社外，有些户本来还不大愿意入，却被“卷”进来，影响了社的巩固；更严重的是盲目集中骨干，抽垮了不少互助组。例如王秋德组共十八户，去年全部报名入社，而社只要了五户，其中有两个党员，一个团员，留下的十三户，只有一个团员作骨干。有些组的大部骨干被抽走后，领导方面也没帮助及时进行整顿，有些剩下来的户，便强找强，硬碰硬，另成新组。有的组集中了三四个骨干；有的却少骨干，缺耕畜，少农具，无法进行互助生产。因此就出现了“富组”“穷组”“骨干组”“倒塌组”。在这种情况下，有些富裕户便乘机拉拢困难户“互助”，他们有以一个畜工去换这些户的六个人工的。新上中农赵全贵把二十八亩土地交在组里，一年只出七十多元工资，他自己却赶上胶皮大车出外赚钱，并说：“你们（困难户）在咱组一样的生产，何必入社找麻烦！”
    根据这种情况，今年八月中旬中共长治地委工作组在这个村试行了合作化的全面规划。
    规划的主要内容是：怎样巩固和提高老社，怎样建立新社，建立几个；哪些群众和哪些骨干参加哪个社、哪个组；哪些组今年建社，哪些组可做为明年扩社对象。以这样具体规划来实现“准备一批，发展一批；一边建社、一边巩固”的办社方针。具体进行的步骤和做法如下：
    第一步，摸清底子，制定方案。据初步分析目前这个村的阶级情况是：全村现有农户二百三十八户，其中贫农两户，占总农户数的百分之零点八；新中农一百六十二户，占总农户百分之六十八
  （其中下中农一百四十户，占全村总农户百分之五十八强）；老中农六十九户，占总农户百分之二十九（其中下中农十四户，占总农户百分之五点八）；地主、富农五户，占总农户百分之二。现在除七十二户已经入社外，全村尚有十四个互助组，共计一百五十三户，单干农民只有十三户，这些农户中的贫农和下中农，对入社要求更迫切。工作组和党支委根据这个情况，制定合作化初步规划方案，在支部大会上作了讨论，一方面教育党员明确认识目前农民积极要求入社的新情况，鼓舞了党员带领农民走合作化道路的积极性；另方面针对部分党员缺乏阶级观点、过分夸大社的缺点以及认为很难再发展社的右倾保守思想，组织党员积极分子讨论，并结合本村农业合作社的优越性和农民群众对社的热情等具体事实进行教育。特别对党员郭保庆的“入社不自由，受洋罪，赚不上钱”的错误论调开展了讨论，从而提高了党员的阶级觉悟。王狗则说：“有广大群众的积极热情和党的正确政策，我们一定能走到社会主义。过去头脑不清，缺乏信心，落后了。”支部书记郭东旺说：“底子清了，工作有奔头，干着高兴。”党员思想趋向一致，通过了规划方案。
    第二步，充分发动群众，把规划建立在群众自觉自愿的基础上。党支部事先了解了各阶层对合作化的态度，接着召开全村群众大会，通过总结农业合作社的优越性，进行了两条道路的生动对比教育，进一步讲明建社的目的和自愿互利政策，让大家讨论。很多农民表示“坚决跟着共产党走合作化的道路。”会后，群众纷纷自行召开家庭会，商量入社。从社外的一百六十六户对合作化态度来看可分如下几类：第一类，看到了农业合作社优越性，相信社会主义前途，经过大会动员，积极要求入社的达百分之七十左右，其中绝大多数是贫农和新老中农中的下中农。其中还有些困难户顾虑别人不要，怕入社得不到照顾，怕投不起资金等。新中农中的下中农成买臣会后动员他七十岁的奶奶入社。老人高兴地说：“只要社要咱，你快去报名吧。”第二类，是愿意入社但不那样迫切，表示入不入都可以。有一部分表现犹豫动摇，前怕虎后怕狼。有些虽也报名入社，但动机不纯。这类户约占百分之二十左右，绝大部分是老中农和新中农中的上中农的一部分。如老中农赵红孩，头一天找互助组长报名入社，但第二天一早却找村的工作人员说：“听到别人都报了名，我觉得不报不好看，所以也报名挂了号，实心我是想明年入社。”第三类，生产资料充足，兵强马壮，生活富裕，他们对合作化顾虑很多，怕入社吃亏，不自由，怕困难户沾了他们的光，这类户占百分之十左右。其中绝大部分是老上中农和一部分新上中农的富裕户，表现能拖就拖，准备再等二、三年。如老上中农王富狗说：“我有车有牲口，有十八亩好地，只要政策允许单干，我就过两三年再说吧。”全村户户开家庭会，各选门路，经过两天酝酿，全村自愿报名入社的即达一百一十四户，超过了支部原估计数。
    第三步：及时审查修正公布规划方案。在群众酝酿申请入社的同时，党支部根据“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，除发动党员深入了解各阶层真实思想外，还有计划有目的地分别召开了各种小型座谈会，用阶级分析的观点摸清他们入社的态度，支部对报名入社户正确地进行定户排队审查，及时向群众公布规划结果，经民主讨论通过。今年报名入社的一百一十四户，除说服申群只等七户互助组骨干仍然领导各自的互助组外，对十七户思想不通和生活较富裕当下不愿入社的户暂留在社外，两户地主、富农不吸收。今年入社的共八十八户，建成三个新社。又成立三个新互助组。新建的三个社，初步搭起了架子，一面积极领导搞好生产，一面开始考虑新建社应办的事情。大家一致认为：这个办法真好，谁先谁后排了队，户户有了底，人人心眼亮，一定能办好社。
    通过党支部领导同群众自愿相结合进行全面规划的结果，排挤贫困户入社的偏向纠正了，骨干过分集中的问题解决了，社组关系密切了。到一九五六年，全村共四个社，入社农户一百六十户，占总农户的百分之六十七。一九五七年，再发展四十五户，入社农户将达到二百○五户，占总农户的百分之八十六左右，全村即可合作化。留在社外的尚有三十三户。其中绝大部分为新上中农和老上中农，还有地主、富农。
    从成家川村的试点中体会到，实行合作化全面规划必须注意以下几点：一、紧紧依靠党支部，发挥党的领导作用。首先使党员干部明确地认识新的形势下出现的新情况，了解合作化运动大发展的必然性，使党的领导赶在运动的前面。然后在这个基础上，广泛全面地进行合作化教育和政策教育，并时刻提高革命警惕性，严防反动富农和其它坏分子的破坏。二、正确地贯彻执行党的阶级路线。深入了解各阶层的思想态度，具体分析研究。明确认识哪些人是走社会主义道路的积极分子，是合作化的主力，是我们依靠的对象；哪些人对社会主义抱消极应付态度，不能依靠。必须深谋远虑，统筹全局，要看到正在建立的新社，也要看到老社；要顾及到老社的巩固和提高，也要顾及到新社的建立和发展；要办好现有的社，也要注意到互助组。三、贯彻领导同群众相结合的群众路线的工作方法，充分培养和运用积极分子，讲明政策，算清利害，让群众充分地酝酿讨论，由他们自己来做。运动规模大小，速度快慢，应根据具体条件办事，绝不能只凭少数工作人员的热情。
