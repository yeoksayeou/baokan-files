The use of high-quality pine wood as dunnage by our bureau in the first half of this year indeed shows a lack of sufficient attention to conserving the country's valuable timber resources. We humbly accept Comrade Wang Zhonglan's criticism.

The dunnage used by our bureau over the years has mostly been discarded railway ties. However, due to poor wood quality, cracks, and warpage, the service life is very short, and a large number of dunnage is scrapped every year, even some that are mostly scrapped before being used. For example, of the more than 250,000 cubic meters of discarded railway ties purchased by the Qingdao warehouse last year from the Northeast Timber Bureau, 80% were fundamentally unusable. Moreover, because the railway ties are pre-shaped, the utilization rate in the warehouse is also very low.

The materials stored by our bureau are mostly large metal materials, which are subject to high pressure and long storage times, making it difficult to move and restack. Once materials are placed in storage, they are generally not easily moved unless under special circumstances, unlike general merchandise warehouses where goods are moved and dunnage is replaced easily. Therefore, dunnage that is not strong enough to withstand pressure or that bends and deforms makes it difficult to ensure the safety of the materials. This is the main reason why we chose high-quality timber this year. This year, we also proposed to the Ministry of Forestry to use some discarded railway ties. The Ministry of Forestry said that there were still some discarded railway ties in Inner Mongolia. Based on this, our bureau sent a special person to the Wuyi Timber Yard to investigate the situation. The timber yard informed us that this batch of railway ties was processed in 1953 and had serious defects such as cracks and warpage. It was estimated that only 10% could be selected for our bureau's use. However, the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Administration firmly disagreed with the selection. The staff sent by our bureau may have had overly high demands, and the supplying unit may also have been insufficiently flexible.

In the future, in order to conserve the country's high-quality timber, ensure the safety of materials, and reduce dunnage waste, we plan to use substitutes as much as possible and reduce the use of wood as dunnage. We have now produced more than 472,000 concrete and stone piers, which can replace approximately 137,000 cubic meters of timber. For the portion that still requires the use of wood, we will also try to use oak and substandard ash railway ties, reducing the use of pine timber to a minimum.

### 国家物资储备局的检讨

    国家物资储备局的检讨
    我局在今年上半年用优质松木做垫木用，确实是对节约国家的优质材种不够重视，我们虚心地接受王中岚同志的批评。
    我局历年来使用的垫木，大部分是废枕木。但是因为木质低劣、裂缝坡楞等缺陷，所以使用年限很短，每年都有大批的垫木报废，甚至还有未曾使用就大部报废的。像去年青岛仓库采购的由东北制材局拨给的二十五万多立方公尺的废枕木，就有百分之八十根本不能使用。而且，由于枕木已经定型，在仓库里的使用率也很低。
    我局所储物资多为大型的金属材料，压力大，存放久，倒垛难，物资一经入库之后，非遇特殊情况，一般不轻易转动，不同于一般商品仓库，吐纳快，倒换垫木容易。所以，抗压力不强或弯扭变形的垫木就难以保证物资安全，这就是我们今年选用优质木材的主要原因。今年我们也曾向林业部提出使用部分废枕木的要求，林业部说内蒙古还有部分废枕木。我局据此派了专人到五一贮木厂去实地了解。贮木厂向我们介绍，这批枕木是一九五三年加工的，裂缝、坡楞等缺陷很严重，估计可以从中挑出百分之十供我局用。但是，内蒙古森林工业管理局坚不同意挑选。我局派出的工作人员可能有要求过高的偏向，而供材单位也可能有不够灵活之处。
    今后为了节约国家的优质木材，并保证物资安全，减少垫木浪费，我们拟尽量使用代量品，少用木材作垫木。现在我们已制成水泥墩和石墩四十七万二千多个，约可代替十三万七千多立方公尺木材。还要使用木材的部分，也要尽量采用柞树和不合规格的水曲柳枕木，把松木锯材缩减到最低限度。
