Xinhua News Agency, September 4th dispatch from Moscow via TASS: Following recent negotiations in Moscow between delegations from the governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, an agreement on civil aviation between the Soviet Union and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was signed on September 3rd. The negotiations were conducted in an atmosphere of sincere friendship and full mutual understanding.

The agreement stipulates the establishment of direct civil aviation routes between the Soviet Union and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Soviet and Yugoslav civil aircraft will both have the right to fly between Moscow and Belgrade.

Signing the agreement on behalf of the Soviet government was Air Force Marshal S. Zhavoronkov, Chief of the Civil Aviation General Administration under the Soviet Council of Ministers. Signing on behalf of the government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was D. Djuric, Minister Plenipotentiary of the Yugoslav Secretariat of Foreign Affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd dispatch from Belgrade: The Vice-Chairman of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, S. Vukmanović-Tempo, expressed satisfaction with the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav economic talks in a statement to the Yugoslav News Agency on the evening of September 2nd. He pointed out that the outcome of the talks was further cooperation with and development of economic ties with the Soviet Union. This result will certainly help to improve Yugoslavia's current economic situation.

Vukmanović-Tempo pointed out that the trade to be carried out, as agreed upon in the talks, would be beneficial to both parties, and the two countries would import the goods they needed. The loan granted by the Soviet Union to Yugoslavia will be able to meet the needs of the Yugoslav economy. He said, "I would like to emphasize that the terms under which Yugoslavia obtained these loans are extremely favorable: the loan stipulates a 2 percent interest rate, repayable in ten years, with the start of repayment postponed for an average of three years. These terms are much more favorable than the terms of loans previously obtained by Yugoslavia or those currently offered in other markets." He pointed out that the credit for purchasing raw materials makes it possible for Yugoslavia to purchase certain raw materials, mainly coking coal and cotton, in the next three years. This loan will greatly alleviate Yugoslavia's shortage of US dollars in its balance of payments.

Vukmanović-Tempo also said that an agreement has now been concluded to provide funds for the design, equipment, and equipment installation for the manufacture of artificial fertilizers in Yugoslavia in the coming year and subsequent years. These investments will be of great significance to Yugoslav agriculture. The nature of these investments is in line with the long-term direction of Yugoslavia's infrastructure policy and current economic development trends.

Vukmanović-Tempo said that in Moscow, the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to provide Yugoslavia with an atomic reactor and a cyclotron, as well as other equipment and materials. The Yugoslav delegation accepted this proposal in principle and agreed to discuss the issue further, at which time a specific decision would likely be made.

    苏联和南斯拉夫签订民用航空协定
    南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席谈苏南经济会谈结果
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联和南斯拉夫两国政府代表团最近在莫斯科进行谈判后，已在九月三日签订了苏联和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国之间的民用航空协定。谈判是在真诚友好和相互充分谅解的气氛中进行的。
    协定规定在苏联和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国之间建立直达民用航空线。苏联和南斯拉夫民用飞机都享有在莫斯科和贝尔格莱德之间飞行的权利。
    代表苏联政府在协定上签字的是苏联部长会议民用航空总局局长、空军元帅谢·热沃隆科夫，代表南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府在协定上签字的是南斯拉夫外交秘书处公使德·朱里茨。
    新华社三日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德二日讯：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国联邦执行委员会副主席斯·伏克曼诺维奇—泰波二日晚上对南斯拉夫通讯社发表谈话，对苏南经济会谈的结果表示满意。他指出，会谈达成的结果是：同苏联进一步合作和发展同苏联的经济联系。这个结果一定能够对改善南斯拉夫目前的经济情况有所帮助。
    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波指出，在会谈中双方协议的将要进行的贸易对双方都是有利的，两国将进口它们所需要的货物。苏联给予南斯拉夫的贷款将能满足南斯拉夫经济的需要。他说，我愿意强调指出，南斯拉夫获得这些贷款的条件是极为有利的：贷款规定在十年还清利息百分之二，开始偿还的时间平均可以推迟三年。这些条件比南斯拉夫以前所获得的贷款的条件或者是目前别的市场上所提出的贷款条件要有利得多。他指出，购买原料的信贷使南斯拉夫有可能在今后三年中购买一定的原料，主要是焦煤和棉花。这项贷款使南斯拉夫可以大大缓和支付账目中缺乏美元的情况。
    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波又说，现在已经缔结了一项协定来提供明年和以后几年中在南斯拉夫制造人造肥料的设计、设备和设备安装的资金。这些投资对于南斯拉夫的农业将有重大意义。这些投资的性质是符合南斯拉夫基本建设政策的长远方针和现在的经济发展趋势的。
    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波说，在莫斯科，苏联表示愿意向南斯拉夫提供一个原子反应堆和回旋加速器以及其他装备和材料。南斯拉夫代表团在原则上接受这个建议，并且同意在以后讨论这个问题，那时大概会作出具体决定。
