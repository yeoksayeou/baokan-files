    Communiqué on the Results of National Economic Development and Implementation of the National Plan for 1954
    September 21, 1955
    In 1954, China's industry, agriculture, capital construction, transportation, domestic and foreign trade, culture, education, health, and people's living standards achieved further development and improvement. The situation in various major sectors is now announced as follows:
    (1) Industrial Production Plan Completion
    In 1954, national state-owned, cooperative-operated (factories affiliated with supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives), and joint state-private industrial enterprises completed 106% of the total output value plan, of which: state-owned industries completed 107% of the plan, cooperative-operated industries completed 112% of the plan, and joint state-private industries completed 99% of the plan.
    In 1954, the percentages of completion of the total output value plan by various industrial ministries were: Ministry of Fuel Industry 108%, of which: General Bureau of Electricity Management 106%, General Bureau of Coal Mine Management 109%, General Bureau of Petroleum Management 109%; Ministry of Heavy Industry 111%, of which: Anshan Iron and Steel Company 108%, Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau 113%, Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau 110%, Chemical Industry Administration Bureau 112%, Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau 107%; First Ministry of Machine Building 103%; Ministry of Textile Industry 103%; Ministry of Light Industry 105%. Industrial enterprises under other ministries such as the Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Foreign Trade, and Ministry of Food also overfulfilled their plans.
    In 1954, the majority of important industrial products from national state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private industrial enterprises, such as electricity, raw coal, crude oil, gasoline, pig iron, steel, rolled steel, coke, copper, lead, zinc, tin, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, caustic soda, soda ash , ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, cement, plate glass, steam boilers, generators, electric motors, transformers, metal-cutting lathes, spinning machines, looms, locomotives, passenger cars, freight cars, ball bearings, timber exports, paper, automobile tires, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, gunny sacks, bicycles, rubber shoes, edible vegetable oil, sugar, flour, cigarettes, matches, etc., completed or overfulfilled the state plan. However, a few products did not complete the plan, such as the First Ministry of Machine Building's hydro turbines, drilling rigs, and bare copper wire, and the Ministry of Light Industry's salt, etc.
    In 1954, various industrial ministries completed or overfulfilled the state plan for reducing costs. The product costs of various industrial ministries in 1954 decreased by 5.8% compared to 1953. The costs of important industrial products such as electricity, raw coal, pig iron, rolled steel, sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate, cement, electric motors, metal-cutting lathes, freight cars, automobile tires, and paper were reduced to varying degrees compared to the plan.
    In 1954, the imbalance between supply, production, and sales of some products was relatively serious; many enterprises did not comprehensively fulfill the state plan; the poor quality of certain products in the machine manufacturing and light industry sectors had not been adequately improved; coal mines, nonferrous metals, and logging departments did not pay enough attention to safe production; many enterprises still had waste in the use of labor, raw materials, and funds.
    (2) Industrial Production Growth and the Growth of Socialist Economic Components
    In 1954, the total industrial output value of the country (excluding handicraft production cooperatives and individual handicrafts) increased by 17% compared to 1953, of which: state-owned industries increased by 27%, cooperative-operated industries increased by 31%, joint state-private industries increased by 25%, and private industries decreased by about 5%.
    In 1954, private industrial enterprises accounting for about one-quarter of the total output value of large-scale private industry had already been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. The value of products processed, ordered, purchased, sold, and acquired by the state accounted for about 89% of the total output value of large-scale private industry.
    By the end of 1954, the number of handicraft production cooperatives had increased to 11,741, an increase of 154% compared to the end of 1953, and the total output value increased by 76% compared to 1953. In addition, 1,042 handicraft supply and marketing production cooperatives and 28,836 production groups were organized.
    In 1954, the total output value of individual handicrafts increased by about 11% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, due to the further development of socialist and semi-socialist industrial production, and due to the continued transformation of private industry by the state, the proportion of state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private industries in the total industrial output value of the country increased significantly, while private industry decreased accordingly. Their proportions are: state-owned industry accounted for about 59%, cooperative-operated industry accounted for about 4%, joint state-private industry accounted for about 12%, and private industry accounted for about 25%.
    In 1954, in the total industrial output value of the country, the production of means of production increased by 20% compared to 1953, and the production of consumer goods increased by 14% compared to 1953; the proportion of the production of means of production increased from 41% in 1953 to 42% in 1954.
    In 1954, modern industry accounted for 33% of the total national industrial and agricultural output value, workshop handicrafts, cooperative handicrafts, and individual handicrafts accounted for 17%, and agriculture and farmers' sideline occupations accounted for 50%.
    In 1954, the output of the vast majority of important industrial products in the country increased significantly. Compared with 1953, their percentages are: electricity 120, raw coal 120, crude oil 127, gasoline 142, pig iron 136, steel 125, rolled steel 117, coke 126, copper 116, lead 180, zinc 131, sulfuric acid 133, nitric acid 161, caustic soda 130, soda ash 139, ammonium sulfate 132, ammonium nitrate 120, cement 119, plate glass 129, steam boilers 104, electric motors 104, transformers 100, spinning machines 168, looms 157, locomotives 520, passenger cars 212, freight cars 121, ball bearings 174, timber exports 126, paper 130, automobile tires 144, cotton yarn 112, cotton cloth 113, bicycles 180, rubber shoes 111, edible vegetable oil 106, sugar 117, flour 109, cigarettes 105, matches 129. However, products such as generators and metal-cutting lathes saw a decrease in output compared to 1953, partly because the original varieties and specifications were not suitable for the needs of national economic construction, and partly because the state trial-produced some new products in 1954.
    (3) Improvement of the Technical Level of State-Owned Industry
    In 1954, many state-owned industrial enterprises achieved certain results in learning and promoting advanced Soviet experience, improving operating methods, improving equipment utilization, and saving raw materials and fuel.
    In the power industry, the capacity of new power generation equipment with automated devices accounted for 20.6% of the total capacity. In the coal mining industry, the degree of pure mechanization of coal mining increased by 8.2% compared to 1953, and the amount of mechanized coal mining accounted for 34% of the total coal mining; the degree of mechanization of haulage in roadways increased by 6.2% compared to 1953, and the amount of mechanized haulage work in roadways accounted for 79.5% of the total haulage work in roadways. In the iron and steel industry, the new Soviet method of repairing open-hearth furnace bottoms has begun to be implemented, shortening the time for repairing furnace bottoms and increasing the production of open-hearth steel. In the black and nonferrous metal mining industries, a quarter of the mines have adopted "hard alloy drill bits," which has improved mining efficiency. In the building materials industry, the advanced experience of "fast cement kiln operation, water cooling, and long-term safe operation" has been promoted in all cement plants, significantly increasing cement production. In the machine manufacturing industry, the furnace body of electric furnaces has been expanded, and the "rapid heating method for forging" has been promoted, greatly improving the situation of insufficient casting and forging capacity. In the textile industry, most cotton mills have strengthened technical measures, adopted "fiber impurity separators," and installed "cotton suction devices," which have increased the utilization rate of chopped cotton waste, reduced flying lint, reduced breakage rates, and saved cotton. In the oil pressing industry, the "Li Chuanjiang oil pressing method" has begun to be promoted, increasing the oil yield.
    Important new products successfully trial-produced by various industrial ministries in 1954 include: 6,000 kW steam turbine generator, 154 kV, 20,000 kVA transformer, combined coal mining machine, coal loading machine, pneumatic rock loading machine capable of loading 20 cubic meters of rock per hour, 300 kW horsepower mine hoist, 100-ton capacity molten iron car, 0.3 cubic meter electric mud gun for automatically closing the tapping hole of large blast furnaces, 1,200 mm diameter spiral classifier, precision boring machine with a boring bar diameter of 85 mm, hydraulically driven precision grinder, dedicated multi-tool semi-automatic lathe, 2,650-ton displacement cargo ship, heat-resistant stainless steel, large tires with a 12-inch cross-section and a 22-inch inner diameter, 24-row seeder, etc., and the first aircraft was successfully trial-produced.
    In 1954, the main technical and economic indicators improved compared to 1953: the standard coal consumption rate for power generation decreased by 2.1%, the recovery rate of raw coal increased by 4.3%, the oil shale mining rate increased by 10.4%, the effective volume utilization of blast furnaces increased by 4.7%, the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces increased by 5.6%, the actual recovery rate of copper beneficiation increased by 3.5%, and the average amount of cotton used per piece of cotton yarn decreased by 1.1 jin.
    However, the coal mines of the Ministry of Fuel Industry did not complete the plan for promoting new coal mining methods and improving the degree of mechanization; some departments did not do enough in comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union and promoting China's existing advanced experience; the work of trial-producing new products did not meet the state's requirements, and some varieties did not complete the trial-production plan. Therefore, mastering and improving technology, promoting advanced experience, and increasing the trial production and manufacturing of new products are still problems that relevant departments must continue to strive to solve in the future.
    (4) Agriculture
    In 1954, the Yangtze and Huai River regions and Hebei Province suffered particularly severe floods, and agricultural production did not complete the plan; however, due to the broad masses of farmers carrying out agricultural production increase movements centered on mutual aid and cooperation under the correct leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, carrying out rescue, dike protection, drainage, seedling rescue, replanting, and supplementary planting work in disaster areas, and organizing production increase movements in non-disaster areas, the output of most major crops reached or exceeded the level of 1953.
    In 1954, the sown area of grain crops nationwide increased by 2% compared to 1953; the sown area of technical crops increased by more than 6% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, the total grain harvest reached 339 billion jin, a slight increase compared to 1953. Compared with 1953, the harvest amounts of various major crops were: rice 99, wheat 128, soybeans 91, miscellaneous grains 97, cotton 91, sugarcane 119, sugar beets 196, jute 106, flue-cured tobacco 109, rapeseed 100, peanuts 130.
    In 1954, state-owned farms continued to develop. The Ministry of Agriculture system had more than 2,400 state-owned farms, of which the number of mechanized farms had increased to 97. These mechanized farms had a total of more than 180,000 hectares of cultivated land, 2,235 tractors (converted to 15 horsepower standard units), and 430 grain combine harvesters.
    In 1954, with the help of the Soviet Union, the large-scale state-owned Friendship Farm had begun construction.
    In 1954, there were 89 tractor stations nationwide, with a total of 778 tractors (converted to 15 horsepower standard units), and the total workload for the year reached more than 80,000 hectares.
    In 1954, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations developed rapidly. By the autumn harvest, farmer households participating in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams accounted for about 60% of the total number of farmer households in the country. A total of more than 114,000 agricultural production cooperatives actually participated in the autumn harvest distribution, with participating farmer households accounting for 2% of the total number of farmer households in the country and operating cultivated land accounting for 3% of the total cultivated land area in the country; compared with 1953, the number of households increased by seven times and the cultivated land area increased by five times. By the end of 1954, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide had developed to nearly 500,000, with participating farmer households accounting for 11% of the total number of farmer households in the country and operating cultivated land accounting for 14% of the total cultivated land area in the country.
    In 1954, the state provided farmers with enormous assistance in agricultural water conservancy, agricultural implements, fertilizer supply, animal disease prevention, and agricultural loans. In order to prevent floods, the state spent more than 240 million yuan on rescue, damming, and dike restoration.
    In 1954, many canals, ponds, weirs, and dams were newly built and renovated, and more than 110,000 waterwheels were loaned, thereby expanding the irrigated area by more than 780,000 hectares and improving the irrigated area by more than 2.46 million hectares. A total of 10,700 water pumps (176,000 horsepower) were used for agricultural water conservancy nationwide, carrying out drainage and irrigation on more than 380,000 hectares of farmland.
    According to a mid-1954 survey, the number of various major livestock increased compared to the same period in 1953, of which: cattle increased by 6%, horses increased by 7%, sheep increased by 13%, and pigs increased by 6%. In the second half of the year, due to disasters and shortcomings in work, the number of draught animals in some areas decreased. In 1954, there were 89 state-owned pastures and breeding farms led by provinces (municipalities) and above, with a total of more than 190,000 head of breeding livestock.
    In 1954, fishery production mutual aid and cooperation organizations continued to develop. The total output of aquatic products increased by 21% compared to 1953, of which the output of state-owned aquatic product enterprises increased by 31% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, mass mutual aid and cooperative afforestation work continued to develop. The total afforestation area nationwide totaled more than 1.16 million hectares, of which: the area of protective forests (including water source forests) was more than 330,000 hectares, and the area of timber forests was more than 630,000 hectares.
    (5) Growth of Capital Construction
    In 1954, the total amount of capital construction investment actually completed by the state increased by 15% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, the total amount of investment actually completed by various industrial ministries increased by 31% compared to 1953, of which construction and installation engineering increased by 16%, and the newly added fixed assets from investment increased by 16%. The proportion of the total amount of investment actually completed by various industrial ministries in the total state investment was 48%.
    In 1954, in terms of industrial construction, a total of 411 construction units above the limit continued construction and started construction, of which 39 construction units had been completed. The thin plate factory and No. 6 blast furnace project of Anshan Iron and Steel, the first phase of the Fushun Aluminum Plant, the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, and the Chongqing Power Plant have all been put into production, and the main part of the Harbin Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory has begun production. In this way, some important products that China could not produce in the past can now begin to be produced.
    In 1954, in terms of railway construction, the total amount of investment actually completed increased by 43% compared to 1953, and a total of 831 kilometers of new railways were laid. Among the newly built lines, the Jining to Erlian section of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway, which connects China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, has been completed; the track laying project from Lanzhou to Yumen on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang line has crossed the Wushao Ridge and reached Jiuba; the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu line has been laid to Guangyuan, and the northern section has only laid 10 kilometers due to the construction of the Weihe River Bridge.
    In 1954, a total of 542 kilometers of newly built narrow-gauge forest railways were completed.
    In 1954, in terms of highway construction, a total of 5,828 kilometers of lines were built nationwide, with 4,311 kilometers completed by central investment, including 3,662 kilometers newly built, 582 kilometers rebuilt, and 67 kilometers restored. The Kangzang Highway has been opened to traffic, and the Qingzang Highway has also been initially opened to traffic.
    In 1954, in terms of water conservancy construction, a total of 650 million cubic meters of earthwork, 8.79 million cubic meters of stonework, and 190,000 cubic meters of concrete were completed nationwide. The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River and the Boshan Reservoir on the Huai River have been fully completed, and the Foziling Reservoir on the Huai River has been basically completed. These water conservancy projects played a significant role in the fight against the particularly severe floods in 1954. Major projects such as the Dahuofang Reservoir, Nanwan Reservoir, and Meishan Reservoir were started and continued to be constructed.
    In 1954, the state built many schools, hospitals, kindergartens, and other cultural and living facilities, and more than 18,000 new hospital beds were added with state investment.
    In 1954, the construction of urban public utilities continued. At the end of 1954, compared with the end of 1953, the length of tap water pipes nationwide increased by 9%, the length of sewers increased by 7%, and the number of public bus vehicles increased by 14%.
    In 1954, the total construction area of houses built by the state totaled more than 47 million square meters, of which the residential construction area was more than 13 million square meters.
    In 1954, the state's capital construction investment plan was not fully completed, and the newly added fixed asset plan and the newly added production capacity plan for certain products were not fully completed; some units inappropriately increased non-productive investment, labor and construction organizations were unsound, and the waste of work stoppages, idle work, stockpiled materials, and equipment was quite common, and the effect of investment was not fully realized.
    In 1954, surveying and design work was greatly improved, and the number of surveying and design personnel increased by 31% compared to 1953. However, the design work still could not meet the needs of construction, causing many units to be unable to start work on schedule or to carry out construction without design.
    In 1954, the amount of geological exploration work nationwide increased by 66% compared to 1953, and the total drilling footage increased by 74% compared to 1953. The main mineral quantities explored by the geological department in 1954, such as coal, iron, copper, and petroleum, all increased significantly compared to 1953.
    (6) Development of Transportation and Postal and Telecommunications Services
    In 1954, railway freight volume completed 103% of the plan, an increase of 20% compared to 1953; freight turnover completed 102% of the plan, an increase of 19% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, compared with 1953, the average number of cars loaded per day on railways increased by 15%, the average total weight of freight trains increased by 5%, and the turnaround time of freight cars shortened by 2.6%.
    In 1954, railway transportation costs decreased by 3% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, the railway freight transportation plan was overfulfilled, but the planning of transportation was not strong enough, and the operating order was not normal enough, resulting in some waste of transportation capacity.
    In 1954, river and sea freight transportation overfulfilled the plan. Their percentages of completion of the plan were: Yangtze River and Songhua River freight volume 104, freight turnover 101; coastal freight volume 114, freight turnover 106. Compared with 1953, their percentages were: Yangtze River and Songhua River freight volume 132, freight turnover 139; coastal freight volume 167, freight turnover 173.
    In 1954, in terms of river and sea transportation, measures such as day and night loading and unloading shift operations and ship time-sharing operation schedules were implemented, and transportation efficiency was improved. However, the quality of dispatching work was not high, there were more production accidents, and the non-productive mooring time of ships was also relatively long.
    In 1954, local transportation freight overfulfilled the plan. Compared with 1953, their percentages were: automobile freight volume 143, freight turnover 158; inland river barge freight volume 135, freight turnover 143.
    In 1954, civil aviation transportation overfulfilled the plan. Compared with 1953, their percentages were: freight volume 131, freight turnover 125.
    In 1954, among various transportation industries, except for railway and civil aviation transportation, which are operated uniformly by the state, state-owned and joint state-private economies accounted for 91% of the coastal and inland river barge freight turnover; in automobile freight turnover, state-owned and joint state-private economies accounted for 72%.
    In 1954, the volume of postal and telecommunications services increased by 9% compared to 1953.
    (7) Expansion of Domestic and Foreign Trade
    In 1954, domestic trade was further expanded on the basis of the continued development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in people's purchasing power.
    In 1954, the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of grain and oil was continued, and the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and the policy of planned purchase of cotton were implemented, so that the state further grasped the commodity sources of major industrial and agricultural products and ensured the continued expansion of the socialist commercial position. In this year, the total purchase value of state-owned domestic commerce increased by 42% compared to 1953, and the total sales value increased by 35% compared to 1953. The total sales value of supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives nationwide increased by 75% compared to 1953; the total value of agricultural products and by-products purchased throughout the year increased by 41% compared to 1953, of which the total value purchased on behalf of the state increased by 44% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, the total retail sales of social commodities nationwide increased by about 12% compared to 1953, of which the retail sales of state-owned and cooperative economies increased by 57% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, the main commodities sold by state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial enterprises to urban and rural residents, compared with 1953, their percentages were: edible vegetable oil 136, sugar 169, cotton cloth 142, towels 112, socks 120, rubber shoes 105, paper 112, coal 119, kerosene 181.
    In 1954, the total amount of grain purchased by the state completed 110% of the plan, and the total amount of grain sold by the state increased by 37% compared to 1953, basically ensuring the supply of grain needed by cities, industrial and mining areas, rural technical crop areas, disaster areas, and other grain-deficient farmers.
    By the end of 1954, the proportion of state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial enterprises in the total wholesale amount of pure commercial institutions nationwide had risen from about 69% in 1953 to about 89%; the proportion of state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial enterprises in the total retail sales of commodities of pure commercial institutions nationwide had risen from about 49% in 1953 to about 67%; the proportion in the total retail sales of social commodities nationwide had risen from about 41% in 1953 to about 58%.
    By the end of 1954, the number of state-owned commercial institutions nationwide increased by 45% compared to the end of 1953. The number of retail stores of supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives increased by 38% compared to the end of 1953, with 170.48 million members, an increase of 8% compared to the end of 1953.
    In 1954, due to the correct implementation of the state's planned purchase and planned supply policy, prices continued to remain stable. The national wholesale price index was 100.4% of 1953, and the retail price index in the eight major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang was 100.4% of 1953.
    In 1954, domestic trade expanded, but not enough attention was paid to the overall arrangement of private commerce in the process of socialist transformation, and state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial enterprises advanced faster in retail; some commodities, due to the unsound wholesale institutions of state-owned commercial enterprises and insufficient investigation and research on the market supply and demand situation, once caused the phenomenon of stockpiling above and stockouts below in some areas; there were also some shortcomings in the work of grain purchase and supply.
    In 1954, China's foreign trade also expanded correspondingly with the development of the national economy. In this year, China conducted trade with the governments and business circles of more than 60 countries, continued to expand economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and developed trade relations with Southeast Asian countries and Western capitalist countries. In 1954, the total import and export trade volume nationwide increased by 4.5% compared to 1953, and both import and export plans were overfulfilled, of which the import of complete sets of equipment for industry and capital construction increased by more than one time compared to 1953, playing an important role in establishing the foundation of China's modern industry.
    (8) Increase in the Number of Employees, Increase in Labor Productivity, and Improvement of Employee Living Standards
    By the end of 1954, the number of employees in the main sectors of the national economy in China (excluding employees in private enterprises) increased by more than 800,000 compared to 1953. Excluding the employees who were transferred from private industry to joint state-private industry and the employees of state-owned commercial enterprises who absorbed private wholesale commercial enterprises, the actual increase was more than 500,000. However, many agencies and enterprises had too many personnel, causing considerable waste.
    In 1954, the state actively carried out the training of workers and cadres, trained a large number of skilled workers, and improved the technical proficiency of on-the-job workers and cadres. Various industrial ministries trained a total of more than 82,000 skilled workers, and more than 250,000 on-the-job workers and cadres improved their technical proficiency through schools and training courses.
    Due to the strengthening of leadership in grass-roots enterprises, the rectification and improvement of labor organization, the improvement of labor technical equipment, the improvement of the proficiency of workers and cadres, and the development of labor competition, the labor productivity of production workers in national state-owned and joint state-private industries nationwide increased by about 15% compared to 1953. The labor productivity of transportation business personnel increased by about 12% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, the living standards of employees nationwide were correspondingly improved with the development of production and the increase in labor productivity. In 1954, the total wage amount of employees in national state-owned and joint state-private industrial enterprises nationwide increased by about 19% compared to 1953, and the average monetary wage of employees increased by about 2.6% compared to 1953. In 1954, as in previous years, employees enjoyed the state's labor insurance or public medical treatment in addition to their wage income. In 1954, the number of employees in enterprises nationwide implementing labor insurance reached 5.38 million, an increase of 11% compared to 1953; the number of employees enjoying public medical treatment reached more than 5 million.
    (9) Achievements in Cultural, Educational, and Health Undertakings
    In 1954, the number of universities and colleges nationwide increased, the work of teaching reform was being further carried out, and there were a total of 258,000 students, an increase of 19% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, there were more than 608,000 students in secondary vocational schools.
    In 1954, a total of more than 47,000 students graduated from universities and colleges, of which engineering graduates accounted for 33%; a total of more than 169,000 students graduated from secondary vocational schools. These graduates have all participated in the country's construction work.
    In 1954, there were more than 3.58 million students in ordinary middle schools, an increase of 22% compared to 1953; there were more than 50,000 students in workers' and peasants' short-term middle schools, an increase of 82% compared to 1953. Elementary education continued to be consolidated and improved, with a total of more than 51.2 million students, a slight decrease compared to 1953 due to the impact of the floods; nurseries and kindergartens have developed.
    In 1954, the number of employees and farmers participating in organized amateur cultural studies increased.
    In 1954, there were 38 research institutions in the Chinese Academy of Sciences system, and the number of researchers increased by 17% compared to 1953.
    In 1954, there were more than 200,000 hospital beds and more than 40,000 sanatorium beds nationwide. Public hospitals under the Ministry of Health system had more than 163,000 beds, an increase of 13% compared to 1953; sanatoriums had more than 14,000 beds, an increase of 33% compared to 1953. The 13 ministries such as industry and transportation and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions system had a total of more than 27,000 hospital beds and more than 22,000 sanatorium beds.
    In 1954, there were more than 22,000 joint clinics of traditional Chinese medicine and joint clinics of traditional Chinese and Western medicine nationwide, with a total of more than 62,000 traditional Chinese medicine doctors working in these clinics.

    关于一九五四年度国民经济发展和国家计划执行结果的公报
    一九五五年九月二十一日
    一九五四年我国工业、农业、基本建设、交通运输、国内外贸易、文化、教育、卫生事业和人民的生活水平，获得了进一步的发展和提高。现将各主要部门的情况发表公报如下：
    （一）工业生产计划完成情况
    一九五四年全国国营、合作社营（供销和消费合作社的附属工厂）和公私合营工业完成总产值计划百分之一○六，其中：国营工业完成计划百分之一○七，合作社营工业完成计划百分之一一二，公私合营工业完成计划百分之九九。
    一九五四年各工业部完成总产值计划的百分比是：燃料工业部一○八，其中：电业管理总局一○六，煤矿管理总局一○九，石油管理总局一○九；重工业部一一一，其中：鞍山钢铁公司一○八，钢铁工业管理局一一三，有色金属工业管理局一一○，化学工业管理局一一二，建筑材料工业管理局一○七；第一机械工业部一○三；纺织工业部一○三；轻工业部一○五。其他各部如林业部、铁道部、商业部、对外贸易部、粮食部等所属工业企业也都超额完成了计划。
    一九五四年全国国营、合作社营和公私合营工业的重要工业产品的绝大部分，如电力、原煤、原油、汽油、生铁、钢、钢压延品、焦炭、铜、铅、锌、锡、硫酸、硝酸、烧碱、纯碱、硫铵、硝铵、水泥、平板玻璃、蒸汽锅炉、发电机、电动机、变压器、金属切削机床、精纺机、织布机、机车、客车、货车、滚珠轴承、运出木材、纸、汽车外胎、棉纱、棉布、麻袋、自行车、胶鞋、食用植物油、糖、面粉、卷烟、火柴等都完成或超额完成了国家计划。但也有少数产品没有完成计划，如第一机械工业部的水力透平、钻探机和裸铜线，轻工业部的盐等。
    一九五四年各工业部完成或超额完成了国家降低成本的计划。一九五四年各工业部的产品成本比较一九五三年降低了百分之五·八。电力、原煤、生铁、钢压延品、硫酸、硫铵、水泥、电动机、金属切削机床、货车、汽车外胎和纸等重要工业产品的成本，比较计划都有不同程度的降低。
    一九五四年有些产品供、产、销不平衡的现象比较严重；不少企业没有全面地完成国家计划；机器制造和轻工业方面的某些产品质量不好的情况还未得到应有的改善；煤矿、有色金属和森林采伐等部门对安全生产还注意不够；在劳动力、原材料和资金的使用方面，很多企业还存在着浪费现象。
    （二）工业生产的增长和社会主义经济成份的增长
    一九五四年全国工业总产值（不包括手工业生产合作社和个体手工业）比较一九五三年增加了百分之一七，其中：国营工业增加了百分之二七，合作社营工业增加了百分之三一，公私合营工业增加了百分之二五，私营工业下降了约百分之五。
    在一九五四年内，占私营大型工业总产值约四分之一的私营工业企业已经转变为公私合营。在私营大型工业总产值中，国家加工、定货、统购、包销和收购等的产品价值约占百分之八九。
    一九五四年底手工业生产合作社已增加到一一、七四一个，社数比较一九五三年底增加了百分之一五四，总产值比较一九五三年增加了百分之七六。此外，还组织了一、○四二个手工业供销生产社和二八、八三六个生产小组。
    一九五四年个体手工业总产值比较一九五三年增加了约百分之一一。
    一九五四年由于社会主义和半社会主义工业生产有了进一步的发展，由于国家对私营工业继续进行了改造，因此，国营、合作社营和公私合营工业在全国工业总产值中所占的比重，有显著的增长，而私营工业则相应地下降。它们的比重是：国营工业约占百分之五九，合作社营工业约占百分之四，公私合营工业约占百分之一二，私营工业约占百分之二五。
    一九五四年在全国工业总产值中，生产资料生产比较一九五三年增加了百分之二○，消费品生产比较一九五三年增加了百分之一四；生产资料生产所占的比重已由一九五三年的百分之四一上升到一九五四年的百分之四二。
    一九五四年全国工农业总产值中，现代工业占百分之三三，工场手工业、合作化手工业和个体手工业占百分之一七，农业和农民的副业占百分之五○。
    一九五四年全国重要工业产品的产量绝大多数都有显著的增加，同一九五三年比较，它们的百分比是：电力一二○，原煤一二○，原油一二七，汽油一四二，生铁一三六，钢一二五，钢压延品一一七，焦炭一二六，铜一一六，铅一八○，锌一三一，硫酸一三三，硝酸一六一，烧碱一三○，纯碱一三九，硫铵一三二，硝铵一二○，水泥一一九，平板玻璃一二九，蒸汽锅炉一○四，电动机一○四，变压器一○○，精纺机一六八，织布机一五七，机车五二○，客车二一二，货车一二一，滚珠轴承一七四，运出木材一二六，纸一三○，汽车外胎一四四，棉纱一一二，棉布一一三，自行车一八○，胶鞋一一一，食用植物油一○六，糖一一七，面粉一○九，卷烟一○五，火柴一二九。但发电机、金属切削机床等产品，一方面因为原有品种、规格不适合国家经济建设的需要，另一方面，国家在一九五四年内试制了一些新产品，所以，这些产品的产量比较一九五三年有所减少。
    （三）国营工业技术水平的提高
    一九五四年很多国营工业企业在学习和推广苏联先进经验，改良操作方法，改进设备利用，以及节约原材料和燃料等方面，都取得了一定的成绩。
    在电力工业中，有自动化装置的新发电设备的容量占总容量的百分之二○·六。在煤矿工业中，采煤纯机械化程度比较一九五三年提高了百分之八·二，机械化采煤量已占全部采煤量的百分之三四；大巷运搬机械化程度比较一九五三年提高了百分之六·二，大巷机械化运搬工作量已占大巷全部运搬工作量的百分之七九·五。在钢铁工业中，已开始推行苏联修补平炉炉底的新方法，缩短了修补炉底的时间，增加了平炉钢的产量。在黑色和有色金属采矿工业中，有四分之一的矿山已采用“硬质合金钎头”，提高了采矿效率。在建筑材料工业中，“水泥窑快速运转、水冷却和长期安全运转”的先进经验已在全部水泥厂中推广，显著地提高了水泥的产量。在机器制造业中，扩大了电炉炉体，推行了“锻造快速加热法”，铸造和锻造能力不足的情况有了很大的改进。在纺织工业中，大多数棉纺厂加强了技术措施，采用了“纤维杂质分离机”，装置了“吸棉器”，使抄斩花回用率提高，飞花减少，断头率降低，节约了用棉。在榨油工业中开始推行了“李川江榨油法”，提高了出油率。
    一九五四年各工业部试制成功的重要新产品有：六、○○○瓩汽轮发电机，一五四千伏、二○、○○○千伏安变压器，联合采煤机，装煤机，每小时能装岩二○立方公尺的气动装岩机，三○○瓩马力的矿井卷扬机，容量一○○吨的铁水车，自动封闭大型高炉出铁口用的○·三立方公尺的电动泥炮，直径一、二○○公厘的螺旋分级机，搪杆直径八五公厘的精密搪床，液压传动的精密磨床，专用的多刀半自动车床，排水量二、六五○吨的货轮，耐热不锈钢，横断面一二吋、内直径二二吋的大型轮胎，二四行播种机等，并试制成功了第一架飞机。
    一九五四年主要技术经济指标比较一九五三年都有提高：发电标准煤耗率降低了百分之二·一，原煤回采率提高了百分之四·三，页岩采油率提高了百分之一○·四，高炉有效容积利用程度提高了百分之四·七，平炉利用系数提高了百分之五·六，铜选矿实收率提高了百分之三·五，每件棉纱用棉量平均降低了一·一市斤。
    但是，燃料工业部各煤矿没有完成推行新法采煤和提高机械化程度的计划；某些部门在全面学习苏联和推广我国已有的先进经验方面做得不够；试制新产品的工作还没有达到国家的要求，还有一部分品种没有完成试制计划。因此，掌握和提高技术，推广先进经验，增加新产品的试制和制造，仍是今后有关部门必须不断努力加以解决的问题。
    （四）农业
    一九五四年长江、淮河地区和河北省遭受了特大的洪水，农业生产没有完成计划；但由于广大农民在各级党委和政府的正确领导下，开展了以互助合作运动为中心的农业增产运动，在灾区进行了抢险、护堤、排涝、救苗、抢种、补种等工作，在非灾区组织了增产运动，大多数主要农作物的产量还是达到或超过了一九五三年的水平。
    一九五四年全国粮食作物播种面积比较一九五三年增加了百分之二；技术作物播种面积比较一九五三年增加了百分之六以上。
    一九五四年粮食总收获量达到三千三百九十亿斤，比较一九五三年略有增加。各种主要作物的收获量同一九五三年比较，它们的百分比是：稻谷九九，小麦一二八，大豆九一，杂粮九七，棉花九一，甘蔗一一九，甜菜一九六，黄麻一○六，烤烟一○九，油菜籽一○○，花生一三○。
    一九五四年国营农场继续有了发展，农业部系统共有国营农场二千四百余个，其中机械化农场已增加到九十七个。这些机械化农场共有耕地十八万余公顷，拖拉机（折合十五马力标准台）二、二三五台，谷物联合收割机四三○台。
    一九五四年在苏联的帮助下，规模巨大的国营友谊农场已经开始兴建。
    一九五四年全国共有拖拉机站八十九个，它们共有拖拉机（折合十五马力标准台）七七八台，全年的工作量达到八万余公顷。
    一九五四年农业生产互助合作组织发展较快。秋收时，参加农业生产合作社和互助组的农户约占全国农户总数的百分之六○。实际参加秋收分配的农业生产合作社共有十一万四千余个，参加的农户占全国农户总数的百分之二，经营的耕地占全国总耕地面积的百分之三；同一九五三年比较，户数增加了七倍，耕地面积增加了五倍。到一九五四年底，全国农业生产合作社已发展到将近五十万个，参加的农户占全国农户总数的百分之一一，经营的耕地占全国总耕地面积的百分之一四。
    一九五四年国家在农田水利、农具、肥料供应、兽疫防治和农业贷款等方面，给了农民巨大的援助。为着防御水灾，国家用于抢险、堵口和复堤等方面的费用达到二亿四千余万元。
    一九五四年新修和整修了许多渠、塘、堰、坝，贷放水车十一万余辆，从而扩大了灌溉面积七十八万余公顷，改善了灌溉面积二百四十六万余公顷。全国用于农田水利方面的抽水机共有一万零七百台（十七万六千余马力），在三十八万余公顷的农田上进行了排水和灌溉。
    一九五四年年中调查，各种主要牲畜的头数比较一九五三年同期都有增加，其中：牛增加了百分之六，马增加了百分之七，羊增加了百分之一三，猪增加了百分之六。下半年由于灾情和工作上有缺点，某些地区的耕畜有所减少。一九五四年全国省（市）以上领导的国营牧场和种畜场已有八十九个，共有种畜十九万余头。
    一九五四年渔业生产互助合作组织继续有了发展。水产总产量比较一九五三年增加了百分之二一，其中国营水产企业的生产量比较一九五三年增加了百分之三一。
    一九五四年群众互助合作造林工作继续有了发展。全国造林总面积共计一百十六万余公顷，其中：防护林（包括水源林）面积三十三万余公顷，用材林面积六十三万余公顷。
    （五）基本建设的增长
    一九五四年国家实际完成的基本建设投资总额比较一九五三年增加了百分之一五。
    一九五四年各工业部实际完成的投资总额比较一九五三年增加了百分之三一，其中建筑安装工程增加了百分之一六，由投资而新增加的固定资产增加了百分之一六。各工业部实际完成的投资总额，在国家投资总额中的比重为百分之四八。
    一九五四年在工业建设方面，共有四百十一个限额以上的建设单位继续施工和开始施工，其中已有三十九个建设单位建设完成。鞍钢的薄板厂和六号高炉工程，抚顺制铝厂第一期工程，沈阳风动工具厂，重庆电厂等重大的工程都已投入生产，哈尔滨量具刃具厂的主要部分已经开始生产。这样，我国过去不能生产的某些重要产品，现在已经能够开始生产了。
    一九五四年在铁路建设方面，实际完成的投资总额比较一九五三年增加了百分之四三，新建铁路共铺轨八三一公里。在新建的线路中，沟通中、苏、蒙三国的集宁——乌兰巴托铁路的集宁至二连段已经铺轨完成；兰州——新疆线的兰州至玉门段的铺轨工程已越过乌鞘岭到达九坝；宝鸡——成都线南段已铺轨到广元，北段因修渭河大桥只铺轨十公里。
    一九五四年完成的新建窄轨森林铁路共计五四二公里。
    一九五四年在公路建设方面，全国共修建线路五、八二八公里，由中央投资完成的四、三一一公里，其中新建三、六六二公里，改建五八二公里，恢复六七公里。康藏公路已经通车，青藏公路也已经初步通车。
    一九五四年在水利建设方面，全国共完成土方六亿五千万立方公尺，石方八百七十九万立方公尺，混凝土十九万立方公尺。永定河的官厅水库和淮河的薄山水库已全部竣工，淮河的佛子岭水库已基本完工，这些水利工程在一九五四年防御特大洪水的斗争中都发挥了显著的作用。开始和继续施工的主要工程有大伙房水库、南湾水库和梅山水库等。
      一九五四年国家兴建了许多学校、医院、幼儿园和其他文化生活设施，由国家投资而新增加的医院床位一万八千余张。
    一九五四年继续进行了城市公用事业的建设。一九五四年底同一九五三年底比较，全国自来水管长度增加了百分之九，下水道长度增加了百分之七，公共汽车车辆数增加了百分之一四。
    一九五四年国家兴建的房屋建筑面积共计四千七百余万平方公尺，其中住宅建筑面积是一千三百余万平方公尺。
    一九五四年国家的基本建设投资计划没有全部完成，新增固定资产计划和某些产品的新增生产能力计划也没有全部完成；有些单位不适当地增加了非生产性的投资，劳动、施工组织不健全，停工、窝工、积压材料和设备的浪费现象相当普遍，没有充分发挥投资的效果。
    一九五四年勘察设计工作有了很大的改进，勘察设计人员比较一九五三年增加了百分之三一。但设计工作仍满足不了施工的需要，使很多单位不能按期开工，或者没有设计即行施工。
    一九五四年全国地质勘探工作量比较一九五三年增加了百分之六六，钻探总进尺比较一九五三年增加了百分之七四。一九五四年地质部门已经探明的主要矿量，如煤、铁、铜、石油等同一九五三年比较都有显著的增加。
    （六）交通运输和邮电事业的发展
    一九五四年铁路货运量完成计划百分之一○三，比较一九五三年增加了百分之二○；货物周转量完成计划百分之一○二，比较一九五三年增加了百分之一九。
    一九五四年同一九五三年比较，铁路每日平均装车数增加了百分之一五，货物列车平均总重增加了百分之五，货车周转时间缩短了百分之二·六。
    一九五四年铁路运输成本比较一九五三年降低了百分之三。
    一九五四年铁路货物运输计划超额完成了，但是运输计划性还不够强，运行秩序不够正常，致使运输力有些浪费。
    一九五四年江、海货物运输超额完成了计划，它们完成计划的百分比是：长江、松花江货运量一○四，货物周转量一○一；沿海货运量一一四，货物周转量一○六。同一九五三年比较，它们的百分比是：长江、松花江货运量一三二，货物周转量一三九；沿海货运量一六七，货物周转量一七三。
    一九五四年在江、海运输方面，实行了昼夜装卸轮班作业计划和船舶分时运行图表等措施，运输效率有了提高。但是，调度工作的质量不高，生产事故较多，船舶非生产性停泊的时间也较长。
    一九五四年地方交通货物运输超额完成了计划，同一九五三年比较，它们的百分比是：汽车货运量一四三，货物周转量一五八；内河轮驳船货运量一三五，货物周转量一四三。
    一九五四年民用航空运输超额完成了计划，同一九五三年比较，它们的百分比是：货运量一三一，货物周转量一二五。
    一九五四年在各种运输业中，除铁路和民用航空运输由国家统一经营外，在沿海和内河轮驳船货物周转量中，国营和公私合营经济占百分之九一；在汽车货物周转量中，国营和公私合营经济占百分之七二。
    一九五四年邮电业务量比较一九五三年增加了百分之九。
    （七）国内外贸易的扩大
    一九五四年国内贸易在工农业生产继续发展和人民购买力提高的基础上，有了进一步的扩大。
    一九五四年继续贯彻了粮食、油料的计划收购和计划供应政策，并开始实行了棉布的计划收购、计划供应和棉花的计划收购政策，这样就使国家进
  一步掌握了主要工农业产品的商品货源，保证了社会主义商业阵地的继续扩大。本年内国营国内商业的购进总值比较一九五三年增加了百分之四二，销售总值比较一九五三年增加了百分之三五。全国供销和消费合作社的销售总值比较一九五三年增加了百分之七五；全年收购农产品和农副产品总值比较一九五三年增加了百分之四一，其中代国家收购的总值比较一九五三年增加了百分之四四。
      一九五四年全国社会商品零售总额比较一九五三年增加了百分之一二左右，其中国营经济和合作社经济的零售额比较一九五三年增加了百分之五七。
    一九五四年国营商业和合作社商业销售给城乡居民的主要商品同一九五三年比较，它们的百分比是：食用植物油一三六，糖一六九，棉布一四二，毛巾一一二，袜子一二○，胶鞋一○五，纸一一二，煤炭一一九，煤油一八一。
    一九五四年国家粮食收购总量完成计划百分之一一○，国家粮食销售总量比较一九五三年增加了百分之三七，基本上保证了城市、工矿区、农村技术作物区、灾区和其他缺粮农民所需粮食的供应。
    到一九五四年底，国营商业和合作社商业在全国纯商业机构批发总额中所占的比重，已由一九五三年的百分之六九左右上升到百分之八九左右；国营商业和合作社商业在全国纯商业机构商品零售总额中所占的比重，已由一九五三年的百分之四九左右上升到百分之六七左右，在全国社会商品零售总额中所占的比重，已由一九五三年的百分之四一左右上升到百分之五八左右。
    到一九五四年底，全国国营商业机构数比较一九五三年底增加了百分之四五。供销和消费合作社的零售店数比较一九五三年底增加了百分之三八，社员一亿七千零四十八万人，比较一九五三年底增加了百分之八。
    一九五四年由于正确执行了国家的计划收购和计划供应政策，物价继续保持稳定，全国批发物价指数为一九五三年的百分之一○○·四，北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、沈阳八大城市的零售物价指数为一九五三年的百分之一○○·四。
    一九五四年国内贸易扩大了，但对于私营商业在社会主义改造过程中的统筹安排还注意不够，国营商业和合作社商业在零售方面前进得快了一些；有些商品由于国营商业批发机构不够健全，对市场的供需状况调查研究不够，曾在部分地区一度产生上面积压、下面脱销的现象；在粮食的收购和供应工作中，也还存在着一些缺点。
    一九五四年我国对外贸易，随着国民经济的发展也有相应的扩大。本年内我国同六十多个国家的政府和工商界进行了贸易，继续扩大了同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作，发展了同东南亚国家和西方资本主义国家的贸易关系。一九五四年全国的进出口贸易额比较一九五三年增加了百分之四·五，进出口计划都已超额完成，其中工业、基本建设的成套设备进口比较一九五三年增加了一倍多，对于建立我国现代化工业的基础起了重要的作用。
    （八）职工人数的增加、劳动生产率的提高和职工生活的改善
    一九五四年底我国国民经济主要部门的职工人数（未包括私营企业职工）比较一九五三年增加了八十余万人，除去从私营工业转变为公私合营工业的职工和国营商业吸收私营批发商业的职工外，实际增加了五十余万人。但是许多机关和企业的人员过多，造成了相当大的浪费。
    一九五四年国家积极进行了工人和干部的培养训练工作，培养了大批的熟练工人，提高了在业工人和干部的技术熟练程度。各工业部共计培养了八万二千余名熟练工人，另有二十五万余名在业工人和干部通过学校和训练班提高了技术熟练程度。
    由于基层企业领导的加强，劳动组织的整顿和改善，劳动技术装备的改进，工人和干部的熟练程度的提高，以及开展了劳动竞赛的结果，一九五四年全国国营和公私合营工业生产工人的劳动生产率比较一九五三年提高了约百分之一五。交通运输营业人员的劳动生产率比较一九五三年提高了约百分之一二。
    一九五四年全国职工的生活，随着生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高，也得到了相应的改善。一九五四年全国国营和公私合营工业企业职工的工资总额比较一九五三年增加了约百分之一九，职工所得货币工资平均计算比较一九五三年提高了约百分之二·六。一九五四年也和往年一样，职工除了工资收入以外，还享受到国家的劳动保险或公费医疗的待遇。一九五四年全国实行劳动保险企业的职工达到五百三十八万人，比较一九五三年增加了百分之一一；享受公费医疗待遇的职工达到五百余万人。
    （九）文化、教育、卫生事业的成就
    一九五四年全国高等学校数有增加，教学改革工作正在进一步地开展，学生共计二十五万八千人，比较一九五三年增加了百分之一九。
      一九五四年中等专业学校共有学生六十万八千余人。
    一九五四年从高等学校毕业的学生共计四万七千余人，其中工科毕业生占百分之三三；从中等专业学校毕业的学生共计十六万九千余人。这些毕业学生都已经参加了国家的建设工作。
    一九五四年普通中学的学生共计三百五十八万余人，比较一九五三年增加了百分之二二；工农速成中学的学生共计五万余人，比较一九五三年增加了百分之八二。小学教育继续在整顿和提高，学生共计五千一百二十余万人，因水灾影响比较一九五三年略有减少；托儿所、幼儿园有发展。
    一九五四年参加有组织的业余文化学习的职工和农民都有了增加。
    一九五四年中国科学院系统的研究机构共有三十八个，研究人员比较一九五三年增加了百分之一七。
    一九五四年全国共有医院床位二十万余张，疗养院、所床位四万余张。卫生部系统所属公立医院共有床位十六万三千余张，比较一九五三年增加了百分之一三；疗养院、所床位一万四千余张，比较一九五三年增加了百分之三三。工业、交通等十三个部和中华全国总工会系统共有医院床位二万七千余张，疗养院、所床位二万二千余张。
    一九五四年全国共有中医联合诊所和中西医联合诊所二万二千余个，在这些诊所里工作的中医师共有六万二千余人。
    一九五四年全国共有电影院八百余座，比较一九五三年增加了百分之五。在全国厂矿、工地和农村中流动的电影放映队共有二千七百余队，比较一九五三年增加了百分之二六。各类电影放映单位的电影观众达到八亿二千余万人次。全国共有各类职业剧团二千四百余个，剧场二千一百余座。
    一九五四年全国共有文化馆二千三百余个，文化站三千九百余个。
    一九五四年全国性的和省（市）、专区地方性的报纸共有二五三种，因撤销大行政区和合并若干省市建制，报纸种数比较一九五三年略有减少，但全年发行总份数达到十七亿一千零八十五万份，比较一九五三年增加了百分之二。杂志三○四种，全年发行了二亿零四百九十三万册，册数比较一九五三年增加了百分之一九。
    一九五四年出版图书共计九亿三千九百九十六万册，比较一九五三年增加了百分之二五，其中用少数民族文字刊印的图书共有八百七十三万册，比较一九五三年增加了百分之一三。
    一九五四年人民广播事业获得了进一步的发展，发射电力比较一九五三年增加了百分之七八。
