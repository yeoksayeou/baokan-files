    Soviet Industry Completes Fifth Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    A. Duginov, Director of the Soviet State Planning Commission
    Thanks to the implementation of the Communist Party's policies, the Soviet people have achieved many new accomplishments in all sectors of the national economy in recent years. The achievements in industrial development are particularly significant. With creative labor, the Soviet people have completed the targets of the Fifth Five-Year Plan for industry ahead of schedule. This is of great significance for the further upsurge of the Soviet economy and the strengthening of the economic power of the socialist camp.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulated that the level of industrial production in 1955 should exceed that of 1950 by approximately 70 percent. However, from May 1, 1954, to May 1, 1955, industrial production had already exceeded the 1950 level by 71 percent. Therefore, in terms of total industrial output, the Fifth Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule in four years and four months.
    The rate of development achieved by Soviet industry is unprecedented in history. In 1954, the output of Soviet large-scale industry was 35 times that of Tsarist Russia in 1913.
    In the past 25 years (excluding war years), Soviet industrial output has increased by an average of 18.2 percent annually. However, during the same period, in the richest capitalist country—the United States—industrial output has increased by an average of only 2.4 percent annually, 3.6 percent for the United Kingdom, and 2.1 percent for France. Everyone knows that the economic power of a country depends not only on the level of production achieved, but also on the speed of production development. These figures clearly and unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of the socialist planned economic system over the capitalist economic system.
    At the same time, it is very important to emphasize that the Communist Party and the Soviet government, in their planned leadership of national economic development, have consistently and firmly followed the great Lenin's instructions: to give priority and more rapid development to heavy industry—the production of the means of production.
    Lenin repeatedly emphasized that large-scale machine industry and its application to agriculture is the only economic foundation of socialism. Heavy industry is the foundation of the entire national economy, the foundation of our country's economic independence, and the source of improving the people's welfare.
    According to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the production of the means of production—the mining of coal and oil, the production of metals, electricity, machinery, equipment, and building materials—should increase by 80 percent during the period of 1951–1955. But in reality, by 1955, the production of the means of production will increase by 84 percent. The summary of the first half of this year proves that this plan has been overfulfilled. The Soviet Union ranks second in the world in the production of pig iron and steel, as well as in coal mining and electricity generation.
    This year, electricity generation will increase by 82 percent compared to 1950, while the Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulated an increase of 80 percent.
    During the years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union extensively launched the construction of new and powerful power stations equipped with the latest technology. Many large-scale power stations have already been put into operation. Among them are the Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Station with a generating capacity of 164,000 kilowatts, the Gumat Hydroelectric Station with a generating capacity of 224,000 kilowatts, the Mingechaur Hydroelectric Station with a generating capacity of 357,000 kilowatts, and the Kama Hydroelectric Station. The generating capacity of the hydroelectric stations currently under construction in the Soviet Union is almost three times the generating capacity of all hydroelectric stations at the beginning of 1954.
    The Soviet Union was the first in the world to build an atomic power station with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts. The construction of the world's largest hydroelectric station on the Volga River (in Kuibyshev and Stalingrad) is also nearing completion.
    The machine-building industry, which is the foundation of technological progress, completed the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan eight months ahead of schedule. The total output of the machine-building industry and metal-processing industry this year will be more than double that of 1950, that is, 4.6 times that of the pre-war year of 1940.
    The rapid development of heavy industry makes it possible to greatly expand the production of consumer goods. In 1955, the production of consumer goods will increase by 72 percent compared to 1950, while the Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulated 65 percent. This means that the Five-Year Plan has also been completed ahead of schedule in this regard.
    On the basis of vigorous development of heavy industry, the Communist Party and the Soviet government are implementing the program of drastically increasing agriculture, stipulating that grain production should be increased to at least 10 billion poods per year in the near future. Currently, more than 1.4 million tractors, 350,000 grain harvesting combines, and thousands of other machines of various kinds are working in the fields of collective farms and state farms. In a short period of time, 28 million to 30 million hectares of virgin and fallow land will be reclaimed.
    Socialist production is planned and continuously developed on the basis of advanced technology through constant improvement of production tools and technological processes. Therefore, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have always considered that the issue of adopting advanced technology in all sectors of the national economy is of paramount importance. The development of advanced technology and the adoption of these technologies in the national economy are realized in accordance with state plans.
    The movement of production innovators and rationalization proposers is of great significance in the struggle to improve labor productivity and expand output. From 1951 to 1954, 3.25 million inventions and rationalization proposals put forward by scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers were adopted in industry, construction, and transportation. For example, at the "VEF" factory in Riga, workers and engineering technicians put forward more than 7,000 rationalization proposals in a short period of time. As a result, in the past three months, labor productivity in an automatic screw lathe workshop has increased by 13 percent.
    Thanks to the constant concern of the Soviet state, scientists and engineers, inventors and rationalization proposers are constantly promoting the progress of science and technology, creating new machines, instruments, advanced technological processes, and so on. The Soviet machine-building industry—the core of heavy industry that promotes technological progress—creates 600 to 700 new types of machine tools, machines, and mechanisms every year. This makes it possible to mechanize heavy and arduous labor, and to implement comprehensive mechanization and automation of production, all of which are the basis for the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the continuous increase in output. In the past four years, labor productivity in industry has increased by 33 percent, and in the first half of this year, it increased by 7 percent compared with the first half of 1954.
    The achievements of socialist industry are great and undeniable. However, the interests of the Soviet state require further improvement of industry on the basis of making full use of modern scientific and technological achievements. The resolution of the July Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee put forward this task, and the Soviet people regard this resolution as a program for achieving a new and powerful upsurge in socialist industry. Therefore, the Soviet people are not satisfied with the achievements they have made, but continue to expose shortcomings and tap new potentials for the more rapid and further development of production. To work better today than yesterday, and to do more for one's beloved country, which is also to do more for oneself than before—this is the constant desire of the Soviet working people. Drill operator V. Polezhayev of the Molotov "Mikha Naurite" factory said at the general workers' meeting to discuss the summary of the July Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee: "In the past, I was satisfied with my achievements. I completed the quota by 300 or 400 percent. Now I think that the achievements I have made are not the highest limit. In the future, I will work better." These ordinary words express the sense of responsibility and concern of the masters who regard the completion of the state plan as their own business.
    Now, in order to strive for a good welcome to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a nationwide socialist competition has been launched throughout the Soviet Union.
    The labor heroism of the Soviet people has played a huge role in achieving great historical victories. Now, it is showing new strength in the struggle to realize the grand program put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to further strengthen and uplift socialist industry.

    苏联工业提前完成了第五个五年计划
    苏联国家计划委员会司长  阿·杜金诺夫
    苏联人民由于实现了共产党的政策，近几年来在国民经济一切部门中都获得了许多新的成就。而在工业发展方面的成就尤其巨大。苏联人民以创造性的劳动，提前完成了第五个五年计划关于工业方面的指标。这对于苏联经济的进一步高涨和加强社会主义阵营的经济力量，都具有十分重大的意义。
    第五个五年计划规定，一九五五年工业生产水平要比一九五○年约超过百分之七十。然而从一九五四年五月一日到一九五五年五月一日的这个时期，工业生产量已经比一九五○年的水平超过了百分之七十一。因此，在工业总产量方面，第五个五年计划已经以四年零四个月的时间提前完成了。
    苏联工业方面所达到的这种发展速度，在历史上是空前的。一九五四年苏联大工业的产量为一九一三年沙皇俄国时代的三十五倍。
    近二十五年来（战争年代除外），苏联工业产量平均每年增加百分之十八点二，然而，在同一时期内，在最富有的资本主义国家——美国，工业产量平均每年只不过增加百分之二点四，英国为百分之三点六，法国为百分之二点一。大家都知道，一个国家的经济威力，不仅决定于生产所达到的水平，还要看生产发展的速度如何。这些数字明显而又确凿地证明了社会主义经济计划制度比资本主义经济制度优越。
    同时，强调指出这点是非常重要的，即共产党和苏联政府在有计划地领导国民经济的发展时，一贯坚定地遵循着伟大的列宁的遗训：要优先和更迅速地发展重工业——生产资料的生产。
    列宁不止一次地强调指出，大机器工业和把它运用到农业中去，这是社会主义的唯一经济基础。重工业是全部国民经济的基础，是我国经济独立的基础，是提高人民福利的源泉。
    根据第五个五年计划规定，在一九五一——一九五五年期间，生产资料的生产——煤和石油的开采，金属、电力、机器、装备和建筑材料的生产应增加百分之八十。但是实际上，到一九五五年，生产资料的生产将增加百分之八十四。今年上半年的总结证明已经超额完成了这个计划。在生铁和钢的生产以及采煤和发电方面，苏联占世界第二位。
    今年，发电量比一九五○年增长百分之八十二，而按照五年计划的规定应增加百分之八十。
    苏联在第五个五年计划年代里，广泛地展开了用最新技术装备起来的新的强大发电站的建筑工作。许多大规模的发电站已经送电了。其中有发电量为十六万四千瓩的齐姆良发电站，发电量为二十二万四千瓩的古马茨克水电站，发电量为三十五万七千瓩的明格查乌尔水电站和卡马水电站等。目前苏联正在建设中的水电站的发电能力，差不多相当于一九五四年年初所有水电站的发电能力的三倍。
    苏联在世界上首先建成了发电能力为五千瓩的原子能发电站。在伏尔加河上（在古比雪夫和斯大林格勒）进行的世界上最大的水电站的建筑工程也接近完工了。
    作为技术进步的基础的机器制造业，比规定期限提前八个月完成了第五个五年计划的任务。今年机器制造工业和金属加工工业的总产量将增为一九五○年的两倍多，即增为战前一九四○年的四点六倍。
    重工业的迅速发展使得有可能大量扩大消费品的生产。一九五五年消费品的生产将比一九五○年提高百分之七十二，而第五个五年计划规定为百分之六十五。这就是说，在这方面也提前完成了五年计划。
    在大力发展重工业的基础上，共产党和苏联政府实现着急剧提高农业的纲领，规定在最近几年内谷物的生产要增加到每年至少有一百亿普特的水平。目前有一百四十多万台拖拉机、三十五万台谷物收割联合机和成千上万的其它各种机器在集体农庄和国营农场的田间工作着。在短期间内，要开垦二千八百万到三千万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地。
    社会主义的生产是在高度技术的基础上，通过对生产工具和工艺规程的经常改进而有计划地不断地发展的。所以共产党和苏联政府过去和现在一直认为，在国民经济一切部门中采用先进技术的问题有着头等重要的意义。发展先进技术和在国民经济中采用这些技术，是根据国家计划来实现的。
    生产革新者和合理化建议者的运动，在为提高劳动生产率和扩大产量的斗争中具有重大意义。从一九五一年到一九五四年，在工业、建筑业和运输业方面曾采用了由科学家、工程师、技师和工人提出的三百二十五万项发明和合理化建议。例如在里加的“威夫”工厂，在不长的时间里，工人和工程技术人员就提出了七千多项合理化建议。结果，最近三个月以来，在一个自动旋床车间里，劳动生产率就提高了百分之十三。
    由于苏维埃国家的不断关怀，科学家和工程师、发明者和合理化建议者不断地推动科学和技术前进，创造着新的机器、仪器、先进的工艺规程等等。苏维埃机器制造业——推动技术进步的重工业的核心——每年都创造出六百到七百种新型机床、机器和机械。这使得繁重的费力的劳动可以机械化，使生产采取综合机械化和自动化，而这一切正是劳动生产率不断提高和产量不断增加的基础。近四年来，在工业方面劳动生产率已经提高了百分之三十三，而今年上半年比一九五四年上半年提高了百分之七。
    社会主义工业所达到的成就是伟大的，无可争辩的。但是苏维埃国家的利益要求在尽量利用现代的科学和技术成就的基础上来进一步提高工业。苏共中央七月全会的决议就提出了这个任务，苏联人民把这项决议看作是使社会主义工业获得新的强大高涨的纲领。因此，苏联人民并不满足于已取得的成就，而继续揭发缺点，为生产的更迅速地进一步发展而发掘新的潜力。今天要比昨天工作得更好，要为自己亲爱的国家，同时也就是为自己比以前做得更多——这就是苏联劳动者的经常愿望。莫洛托夫“米哈瑙利特”工厂钻工弗·波列若也夫在全体工人讨论苏共中央七月全会总结的大会上发言时说道：“过去我曾满足于自己所达到的成绩。我百分之三百、四百地完成的定额。现在我认为已经达到的成绩并不是最高的限度。今后我要更好地工作。”在这些普通的话里表现出了把完成国家计划看作自己切身事业的那种主人翁的关心和责任感。
    现在，为了争取很好地迎接苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，在苏联全国展开了全民的社会主义竞赛。
    苏联人民的劳动英雄主义在历次取得伟大的历史性胜利中起了巨大的作用。现在它又在为实现苏联共产党所提出的使社会主义工业进一步强大高涨的宏伟纲领的斗争中表现出新的力量。
