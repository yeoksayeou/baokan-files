Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: Today, this reporter interviewed the负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge) of the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce regarding the arrangements and transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises in various regions this year. He said: In the first half of this year, various regions implemented the policy of "taking all factors into consideration and making overall arrangements" and conducted comprehensive arrangement and transformation work on capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises. The production and operation of private industrial and commercial enterprises has largely stabilized, fundamentally changing the serious difficulties brought about by their own blind development and corrupt management.

The负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge) of the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce said that after the arrangements, the trend of declining production in private industry since the second quarter of last year has changed, with the output value in the second quarter of this year increasing compared to the first quarter. The output value of private large-scale industries in twelve cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai increased by 2.35 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Cities with relatively large increases include Beijing, Xi'an, Harbin, Jinan, Tianjin, and Qingdao, with increases ranging from 5 to over 22 percent. Some industries have turned from losses to profits or break-even. In Shanghai, the steel and shipbuilding industries generally suffered losses in January and February, but achieved a balance of income and expenditure with some profits in June. In Harbin, all nine households in the dyeing and finishing industry suffered losses in the first quarter, but seven households had profits in the second quarter. In terms of commerce, the total retail sales of private commerce and state capitalist commerce in thirty-two cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai increased by 3.18 percent in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter, of which the retail sales of state capitalist commerce increased by over 13 percent compared to the previous quarter. Most industries have turned from losses to profits or are close to maintaining profitability. For example, in Tianjin, over 11,000 households in 34 industries including department stores, cotton cloth, new medicines, groceries, and electrical materials saw their profits increase by 136.65 percent in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and the proportion of businesses experiencing losses decreased from 51.22 percent in the first quarter to 48.48 percent in the second quarter. In Shanghai, the turnover of five industries including cotton cloth, coal, firewood, tea snacks, southern goods, and new medicines in the second quarter exceeded the maintenance level by 10 to 20 percent.

The负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge) of the Administration for Industry and Commerce said that due to the implementation of the policy of "taking all factors into consideration and making overall arrangements," state capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises in various regions have greatly developed this year. In the second quarter, the output value of processing, ordering, exclusive sales, and purchasing of private large-scale industries in twelve cities including Beijing increased by 2.38 percent compared to the previous quarter, accounting for 93.47 percent of the total output value of private large-scale industries. In terms of commerce, the proportion of state capitalism is also rising. Among the thirty-two cities, the proportion of state capitalist commerce in the total retail sales of private commerce was 38 percent in the first quarter, rising to 42 percent in the second quarter. In the first half of this year, many cities prepared conditions for the overall transformation in the production arrangements. For example, based on the work in the first half of this year, Shanghai approved 102 private heavy industrial factories and 168 private light industrial factories for joint state-private operation in July and August this year, of which all the light industry portion adopted joint operation by industry. In addition to a portion of these factories operating jointly independently, the rest adopted the method of large factories leading small factories and advanced factories leading backward factories to carry out factory mergers and joint operations, based on national needs and capitalists' willingness. The 168 light industrial factories will be merged into 101 factories.

The负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge) of the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce said that there are also some problems in the work of arranging private industrial and commercial enterprises this year. In the industrial sector, some local state-owned enterprises have not earnestly implemented the policy of giving up a portion of production tasks to maintain and transform private industry; there is still a phenomenon of blind development in handicrafts. In arranging production, less work has been done to rectify and reform enterprises, and the arrangement and transformation have not been combined better. In the commercial sector, after private merchants were converted to distributors and agents, there has been no further promotion of improving their business management, and the work of adjusting the commercial network has not yet been carried out.

The负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge) of the Administration for Industry and Commerce said that in the arrangements, some capitalists have become active because they have been taken care of, but many capitalists still hold a simple attitude of relying on and waiting for arrangements. Some large commercial capitalists have the erroneous idea of blindly expanding operations to increase profits, hoping that small households will merge into larger ones, believing that the larger the scale, the better. There are also some private merchants who accept distribution and agency sales engaging in illegal activities such as adulteration and counterfeiting. Therefore, cadres of local industrial and commercial administrative departments and other relevant departments must strengthen education to capitalists and correct their incorrect thoughts and illegal behaviors in a timely manner.

### 各地贯彻“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针  私营工商业的生产经营情况已大体稳定

    各地贯彻“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针
    私营工商业的生产经营情况已大体稳定
    新华社十五日讯　今天，本社记者就今年各地私营工商业的安排和改造情况，访问了中央工商行政管理局负责人。他说：今年上半年各地贯彻“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针，对资本主义工商业进行了全面安排和改造工作，私营工商业的生产经营情况已大体稳定下来，基本上改变了由于本身的盲目发展和经营管理腐败所带来的严重困难局面。
    中央工商行政管理局负责人说，经过安排，私营工业自去年第二季度以来生产逐季下降的趋势已有改变，今年第二季度的产值比第一季度增加。北京、天津、上海等十二个城市私营大型工业第二季度的产值，比第一季度增加百分之二点三五，增加较多的如北京、西安、哈尔滨、济南、天津、青岛等城市，增加百分之五到百分之二十二多。部分行业已由亏损转为盈余或保本。上海市钢铁业和造船业一、二月份普遍亏本，六月份已做到收支平衡并有盈余。哈尔滨市漂染业九户第一季家家亏损，第二季已有七户有盈余。商业方面，第二季度北京、天津、上海等三十二个城市的私营商业和国家资本主义商业的零售总额，比上季度增加百分之三点一八，其中国家资本主义商业的零售额比上季增加百分之十三多。多数行业由亏损转为盈余或接近维持。如天津市百货、棉布、新药、杂货、电料等三十四个行业一万一千多户，第二季度的盈余额比第一季度增加百分之一百三十六点六五，亏损面由第一季度的百分之五十一点二二缩小为第二季度的百分之四十八点四八。上海市棉布、煤、薪炭、茶食、南货、新药等五个行业第二季的营业额，超过维持水平百分之十到二十。
    工商行政管理局负责人说，由于贯彻“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针，今年各地国家资本主义性质的工商业得到很大发展。第二季度北京等十二个城市私营大型工业加工、订货、包销、收购的产值比上季度增加百分之二点三八，在私营大型工业总产值中所占的比重达到百分之九十三点四七。商业方面，国家资本主义的比重也是上升的。三十二个城市中，国家资本主义商业在私营商业零售总额中所占的比重，第一季度为百分之三十八，第二季度上升到百分之四十二。今年上半年在生产安排中，不少城市为全业改造准备了条件。如上海市在今年上半年的工作基础上，今年七、八月份批准了一百零二个私营重工业工厂和一百六十八个私营轻工业工厂实行公私合营，其中轻工业部分全部是采取按行业全业合营。这些工厂中除一部分单独合营外，其余的按国家需要和资本家自愿，采取大厂带小厂、先进厂带落后厂的方式，进行并厂合营。一百六十八个轻工业工厂就将裁并为一百零一个工厂。
    中央工商行政管理局负责人说，今年在安排私营工商业的工作中也存在着一些问题。在工业方面，有些地方国营企业单位对让出一部分生产任务来维持、改造私营工业的方针，没有认真执行；手工业还有盲目发展的现象。在安排生产中，对企业进行整顿和改革的工作做得较少，还没有把安排和改造结合得更好。在商业方面，把私商转为经销代销以后，还没有进一步推动他们改善企业的经营管理，调整商业网的工作也还未展开。
    工商行政管理局负责人说，在安排中，有一些资本家因得到照顾而积极起来，但也有不少资本家抱着单纯依赖等待安排的态度，有些大户商业资本家存在盲目扩大经营增加利润的错误思想，希望小户并入，规模愈大愈好，还有些接受经销代销的私商进行掺杂掺假等违法活动。因此各地工商行政部门和其他有关部门的干部，必须加强对资本家进行教育，及时纠正他们不正确的思想和违法行为。
