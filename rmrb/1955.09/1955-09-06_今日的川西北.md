Today's Northwest Sichuan

    A Beautiful and Rich Place

    In the northwestern part of Sichuan Province, the "Land of Abundance," lies a vast plateau spanning over a thousand miles: the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region. This place is beautiful and rich. Lush, verdant primeval forests cover ridge after ridge, resembling a vast green ocean when viewed from above. On the boundless grasslands, countless herds of cattle, horses, and sheep graze. In summer, the grasslands are lush with water and grass, and wildflowers bloom, resembling a beautiful large garden. This area produces sturdy, fast-galloping "Tangke Horses," sheep weighing over a hundred pounds, as well as livestock products such as hides, furs, and cheese. It also produces velvet antlers, musk, cordyceps, fritillaria bulbs, and Jinchuan snow pears that are sold throughout the country, as well as the world's precious animal, the panda, and many mineral deposits. The Northwest Sichuan Plateau has countless rivers, and surveys are currently underway to prepare for the construction of hydroelectric power stations.

    The Chengdu-Aba Highway

    The construction and phased opening of the Chengdu-Aba Highway has brought prosperity and happiness to the Northwest Sichuan Plateau. People say that this is a road to happiness. The Chengdu-Aba Highway starts from Chengdu and reaches Aba on the Northwest Sichuan Plateau, with a total length of over five hundred kilometers. When this highway is mentioned, the people of all ethnic groups in Northwest Sichuan sing the praises of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Han workers for their hard work. Before liberation, the reactionaries implemented a policy of blockade, confining the minority nationalities in the mountain valleys. At that time, the daily necessities needed by the people of all ethnic groups, such as oil, salt, grain, and cloth, could not be transported in, and local specialties could not be transported out. The people's lives were extremely miserable.

    In March 1951, the Chengdu-Aba Highway began construction with the participation of tens of thousands of road construction soldiers, workers, and civilians. With the continuous extension of the highway, all kinds of daily necessities needed by the people of all ethnic groups were continuously transported in along the highway, and prices generally fell. The local specialties of the plateau opened up sales channels, and prices increased relatively. Before liberation, one jin of fritillaria bulbs in Gengda Township, Wenchuan County, could only be exchanged for six jin of salt. In 1954, one jin of fritillaria bulbs could be exchanged for forty-three jin of salt. Now, the purchase price of wool in the Aba area is more than double that of 1949 before liberation. Today, more and more people in rural areas are using toothpaste, towels, rubber shoes, and flashlights. Wherever the car goes, the lives of the people there can be improved. Every time the highway is opened to traffic in sections and a traffic opening ceremony is held, the fraternal ethnic groups from remote mountain villages dress in festive costumes, beat gongs and drums, and cross mountains and ridges to welcome the cars, present flags and flowers to the road construction personnel, and present the most precious gift of the Tibetan people - "Hada."

    The New City on the Plateau - Shua Jing Si

    The car departs from Chengdu, travels along the Chengdu-Aba Highway for more than a day, crosses the snowy, 4,000-meter-high Zhegushan Mountain, and arrives at Shua Jing Si, the political center of the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region.

    Shua Jing Si is located at the junction of the agricultural and pastoral areas of the Northwest Sichuan Plateau. In 1935, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led by our great leader Chairman Mao, passed through here during the Long March of 25,000 Li. In the past, Shua Jing Si was a desolate place, with only a dozen herdsmen's "winter tents." In summer and autumn, the herdsmen drove their cattle and sheep to the high mountains to graze. In winter and spring, the herdsmen returned to the "winter tents" to spend the winter. Today's Shua Jing Si has a flat and wide street, with beautiful ethnic trade buildings, post and telecommunications bureaus, people's banks, Xinhua bookstores, salt bureaus, transportation companies, and more than 100 private industrial and commercial enterprises on both sides of the street. People can buy daily necessities such as salt, tea, and various industrial products produced in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places. Various books, periodicals, and newspapers published nationwide can also be seen here. The Autonomous Region People's Hospital built on the west bank of the Suomo River has internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, dentistry, otolaryngology, and other departments, as well as X-ray rooms, operating rooms, and well-equipped wards.

    At night, the newly built Mingyuan Power Plant in Shua Jing Si transmits electricity to the offices, factories, and residential houses of various organs. For thousands of years, bright electric lights have appeared in this place that was illuminated by pine torches. At this time, the wired broadcasting station broadcasts music from Beijing, and movies are being shown in the auditorium.

    Longri Farm

    On May 1st, International Labor Day, 1954, Longri Farm was officially established. Longri Farm was built in the Longri Dam area, which is a fertile large grassland, and the Bailu River, a tributary of the Yellow River, passes through the grassland. According to preliminary surveys, the Longri Dam grassland has a total arable area of more than 160,000 mu. The climate on the grassland is very cold, and it often snows all year round. In the past, local herdsmen always believed that crops would not grow in such a cold place, so they allowed this land to lie barren for thousands of years. After liberation, trial planting proved that crops could be grown on the Longri Dam grassland at an altitude of more than 3,700 meters. Large radishes weighing three jin, large Chinese cabbages weighing eight jin, and potatoes weighing one jin were produced here. Highland barley produced up to 206 jin per mu. The successful trial planting of grain here can not only solve the food problem of herdsmen on the grassland, but also promote the trial planting experience throughout the Northwest Sichuan Plateau.

    Now Longri Farm has built farm headquarters, ranch headquarters, livestock sheds, tractor sheds, clinics, and other houses, covering an area of more than 13,000 square meters. The construction of Longri Farm demonstrates the happy prospects of the Autonomous Region. People of all ethnic groups love the farm and actively support its construction. Some people travel hundreds of miles to buy high-quality seeds for the farm, and herdsmen introduce their livestock experience to the farm.

    Unite and Advance

    The Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of division and oppression against minority nationalities caused disunity between and within the various ethnic groups of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. At that time, disputes and armed fights often occurred. Longri Dam before liberation was a battlefield for armed fights. I don't know how many fraternal ethnic groups died in the armed fights, and some families even became extinct.

    After liberation, under the call of the great ethnic policy of the Communist Party of China, a new atmosphere of increasing unity and friendship has emerged between and within the various ethnic groups of the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region. Former enemies have become relatives, and "enemies" who never met in the past have become close friends. Everyone is united to work hard for the construction of the Autonomous Region.

    今日的川西北
    杨毓初
    美丽富饶的地方
    在“天府之国”的四川省西北部，有一片纵横千多里的辽阔高原，这就是四川省藏族自治区。这里是美丽而富饶的。葱茂翠绿的原始森林，覆盖着一个山岭又一个山岭，站在高处望去，像一片浩瀚的绿色海洋。在一望无际的草原上，牧放着无数的牛群、马群和羊群。到了夏天，草原上水草丰茂，鲜花盛开，像一个美丽的大花园。这里产有膘肥体壮、善于驰骋的“唐克大马”，一百多斤重的羊，以及皮毛、乳酪等畜产品，有行销全国的鹿茸、麝香、虫草、贝母和金川雪梨，有世界上珍奇的动物——熊猫，还有很多矿藏。川西北高原上有无数河流，现正在勘测准备建设水力发电站。
      成阿公路
    成阿公路的修筑和逐段通车给川西北高原带来了繁荣和幸福，人们说这是一条通向幸福的道路。成阿公路，起自成都，到达川西北高原的阿坝，全长五百多公里。提起这条公路，川西北的各族人民就要歌颂毛主席和共产党，感谢中国人民解放军和汉族工人老大哥。解放前，反动派实行封锁政策，把少数民族封闭在山沟里。那时各族人民需要的油、盐、粮食、布疋等生活必需品都运不进来，土特产品也运不出去，人民的生活极端悲惨。
    一九五一年三月成阿公路在成千上万的筑路军工和民工参加下，动工修筑。随着公路的不断伸延，各族人民日常需要的各种生活用品，沿着公路源源不绝地运进来，价格也普遍下降。高原上的土特产品打开了销路，价格相对地提高。解放前，汶川县耿达乡一斤贝母只能换六斤盐，一九五四年一斤贝母就可以换到四十三斤盐了。现在阿坝地区的羊毛收购价格比解放前一九四九年提高了一倍多。现在农村里用牙膏、毛巾、胶鞋、手电筒的人一天比一天多起来。汽车通到哪里，哪里人民的生活就能得到改善。每当公路分段通车，举行通车典礼时，深山远寨的兄弟民族都穿上节日盛装，敲锣打鼓，翻山越岭赶来迎接汽车，给筑路人员献旗、献花，献上藏族人民最珍贵的礼物——“哈达”。
    高原上的新城——刷经寺
    汽车从成都出发，沿成阿公路驶行一天多时间，翻过白雪皑皑、拔海四千多公尺的鹧鸪山，就到达四川省藏族自治区的政治中心刷经寺。
    刷经寺位于川西北高原农、牧业区交界处。一九三五年，我们伟大的领袖毛主席领导的工农红军，进行二万五千里长征时曾路过这里。过去刷经寺是个荒凉的地方，只有十来户牧民的“冬帐房”，夏、秋两季牧民把牛羊赶到高山去放牧，冬季和春季牧民们就回到“冬帐房”来过冬。今日的刷经寺，一条平坦宽阔的大街已经形成，街道两旁有漂亮的民族贸易大楼，有邮电局、人民银行、新华书店、盐务局、运输公司，还有一百多家私营工商业。人们从这里可以买到生活必需的盐、茶叶和上海、天津、广州等地出产的各种工业品。全国出版的各种书刊、报纸，这里也能看到。在梭磨河西岸修建的自治区人民医院，设有内科、外科、小儿科、妇产科、牙科、五官科等，还有爱克司光室、手术室和设备较完善的病房。
    夜晚，刷经寺新建的明原电厂，把电力输送到各机关、工厂和居民的住宅。几千年来，在这个用松明照亮的地方，出现了明亮的电灯光。这时，有线广播站播送出北京的乐曲，大礼堂内在上演电影。
      龙日农场
    一九五四年“五一”国际劳动节那天，龙日农场正式成立了。龙日农场兴建在龙日坝地方，这里是一个肥美的大草原，黄河的支流白河从草原上穿过。据初步调查，龙日坝草原可耕的面积共有十六万多亩。草原上气候很冷，一年四季常常飘雪花。过去当地牧民一直认为在这样寒冷的地方是不长庄稼的，几千年来就让这块土地白白地荒芜了。在解放后，经过试种的结果证明：在拔海三千七百多公尺的龙日坝草原上，完全可以种庄稼，这里出产了三斤重的大萝卜、八斤重的大白菜、一斤重的马铃薯，青稞每亩最高产到二百零六斤。这里试种粮食成功后，不但可以解决草原上牧民的粮食问题，同时还可以把试种经验在整个川西北高原上推广。
    现在龙日农场已经修建了农场场部、牧场场部、牲畜棚舍、拖拉机棚、医务所等房屋，占地面积约一万三千多平方公尺。龙日农场的兴建，展示了自治区幸福的远景。各族人民都热爱农场，积极支援农场的兴建。有的人跑几百里路为农场购买优良种籽，牧民们把自己的牧畜经验介绍给农场。
      团结前进
    国民党反动派对少数民族实行的分裂、压迫政策，造成了藏族自治区各民族之间和民族内部的不团结，那时纠纷、械斗时常发生。解放前的龙日坝就是一个械斗的战场，兄弟民族因械斗死亡的不知有多少，有的人家甚至“绝”了户。
    解放后，在中国共产党的伟大的民族政策感召下，四川省藏族自治区各民族之间和民族内部，出现了日益团结、友爱的新气象。过去的仇人成了亲人，过去不见面的“冤家”成了亲密的朋友，大家团结在一起为建设自治区而努力。（附图片）
