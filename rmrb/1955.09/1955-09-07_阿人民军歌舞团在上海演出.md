Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 6th: The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe visited and performed in Shanghai from August 29th to September 5th.

The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe performed six shows for the people and garrison troops of Shanghai. The spacious Cultural Square was filled to capacity for each performance. During the performances, applause and cheers could be heard from far away.

The Song and Dance Troupe visited the East China Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music in Shanghai. The teachers and students of the school held a concert for them. The guests also visited workers' cultural palaces, factories, and workers' residential areas, and joined more than 400 children at the Children's Palace.

On the 5th, the artists of the Song and Dance Troupe, together with Shanghai literary and art workers and military art workers, held a symposium. They introduced each other's work in the field of literature and art, and divided into four groups—folk music, instrumental music, vocal music, and dance—to exchange techniques and give demonstration performances of individual programs.

During their stay in Shanghai, the Song and Dance Troupe also attended banquets and receptions hosted by Liao Rongbiao, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Xu Jianguo, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai. The distinguished guests expressed great interest in the acrobatic performances by Shanghai literary and art workers.

On the morning of the 6th, the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe left Shanghai by special train for a visit and performance in Hangzhou.
