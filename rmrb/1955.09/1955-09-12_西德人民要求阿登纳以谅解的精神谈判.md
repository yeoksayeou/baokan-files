Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 11th: People from all walks of life in West Germany are eagerly anticipating positive results from the Soviet-West German talks. They demand that Adenauer abandon his "policy of strength" and negotiate in a spirit of understanding.

    The chairman of the German People's League, Elvers, speaking at a mass meeting in Bremerhaven on the 9th, demanded that the West German government delegation conduct negotiations in Moscow in a spirit of understanding.

    Mayors, farmers, and residents of eleven towns in Westphalia jointly signed a statement on the 9th, demanding that Adenauer reach an understanding with the Soviet Union. The statement said: "We welcome the Federal Chancellor's visit to Moscow and expect that this visit will further ease international relations. We believe that continuing to maintain the Paris Agreement and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on one side, and the Warsaw Pact on the other, does not contribute to European peace and German unification. On the contrary, the establishment of an all-European collective security treaty will contribute to the cause of peace and unity."

    According to a report in the German Communist Party's "Freies Volk" on the 9th, the newspaper recently conducted a series of opinion polls among West German working people on the Moscow negotiations. The general opinion in their replies was that the West German government should reach an understanding with the Soviet Union. Representatives of the Munich Building, Bricklaying, and Earthwork Union stated that this opportunity must be used to restore relations with the Soviet Union. A worker representative from Lower Saxony said: "The Soviet Union has made enough proposals for easing the situation. Now it depends on whether Adenauer can bring back positive results from Moscow." A transport worker from Dusseldorf said: As long as Adenauer is sincere, the negotiations will be successful.

    西德人民要求阿登纳以谅解的精神谈判
    新华社柏林十一日电　西德各阶层人民热烈期待苏联和西德的会谈获得积极成果。他们要求阿登纳放弃“实力政策”，以谅解的精神进行谈判。
    德国人联盟主席艾尔费斯九日在不来梅港的群众大会上讲话，要求西德政府代表团必须以谅解的精神在莫斯科进行谈判。
    威斯特伐利亚州十一个城镇的市长、农民和居民九日联合签署了一项声明，要求阿登纳必须和苏联达成谅解。这项声明说：“我们欢迎联邦总理访问莫斯科，并且期望这次访问将进一步缓和国际关系。我们认为继续保持巴黎协定和北大西洋公约为一方、华沙条约为另一方，并不能有助于欧洲的和平和德国的统一。与此相反，建立一个全欧集体安全公约才能有助于和平和统一的事业。”
    据德国共产党“自由人民报”九日报道，这家报纸不久以前曾经在西德劳动人民中间就莫斯科谈判问题进行了一系列的意见询问。他们在回答中总的意见是要求西德政府和苏联谅解。慕尼黑建筑、砖石、泥土工会的代表表示必须利用这次机会同苏联恢复关系。下萨克森州一个工人代表说：“苏联对于缓和局势已经作了足够的建议，现在就要看阿登纳能否从莫斯科带回积极成果了。”杜塞尔多夫一个运输工人说：只要阿登纳有诚意，谈判必将获得成果。
