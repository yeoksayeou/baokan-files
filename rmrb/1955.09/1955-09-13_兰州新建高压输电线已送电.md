    New High-Voltage Power Line in Lanzhou Put into Operation
    On the morning of the 7th, a newly built high-voltage power line in the Lanzhou area began transmitting electricity to nearby areas.

    This high-voltage power line was constructed to meet the industrial development of the Lanzhou area. Since construction began in April this year, it has progressed rapidly. A large section of the power line is erected in mountainous areas. Workers adopted special methods of erecting iron towers and concrete poles to avoid high-altitude operations on the mountains and ensure safety. (Xinhua News Agency)

    兰州新建高压输电线已送电
    七日早晨，在兰州地区新建成的一条高压输电线开始向附近送电了。
    这条高压输电线是适应兰州地区的工业发展而建设的。它从今年四月动工以来，进展很快。输电线有很大一段是架设在山地上，工人们曾采取了特殊的架设铁塔和水泥杆的方法，避免了山地高空作业，保证了安全。　（新华社）
