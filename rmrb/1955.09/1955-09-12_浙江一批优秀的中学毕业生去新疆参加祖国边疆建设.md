A batch of 504 outstanding junior and senior high school graduates from Zhejiang Province, volunteering to participate in the construction of the motherland's border regions, left Hangzhou in batches by train on September 7th and 8th to embrace a new life in Xinjiang.

Among the more than 500 students going to Xinjiang this time, there are 301 members of the Communist Youth League and 80 graduates from health and nursing schools. They were selected from the current graduates of seven cities and five special districts, including Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wenzhou, for their good character, excellent academic performance, and strong physique. They all felt honored to be selected to participate in border construction.

Before the departure of the young students going to Xinjiang, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education and the Hangzhou Municipal Education Bureau jointly held a farewell meeting. Chen Li, Deputy Director of the Department of Education, encouraged the students to overcome difficulties and build the border region into a beautiful paradise with their own hands. Zheng Fenggui, the student representative to Xinjiang, said in her reply: "We will never let down the expectations of the Party and the people. We must build the border region as beautiful as the West Lake in Hangzhou." (Our correspondent in Hangzhou)

    浙江一批优秀的中学毕业生去新疆参加祖国边疆建设
    浙江省志愿参加祖国边疆建设的初中、高中毕业生五百零四人，于九月七、八两日分批乘车离开杭州，去新疆迎接新的生活。
    这次去新疆的五百多名学生中，有青年团员三百零一人，有卫生、护士学校毕业生八十人。他们是从杭州、宁波、温州等七个市和五个专区本届毕业生中挑选出来的品学优良、身体强壮的青年学生。他们都为自己能被挑选参加边疆建设感到光荣。
    去新疆的青年学生在出发前，浙江省教育厅和杭州市教育局曾联合举行了欢送大会。教育厅副厅长陈立勉励同学们克服困难，战胜困难，用自己的双手把边疆建设成美丽的乐园。赴新疆的学生代表郑凤桂致答词说：“决不辜负党和人民对我们的期望，我们一定要把边疆建设得和杭州西湖一样美丽。”　（本报驻杭州记者）
