A horizontal adit in the southern Zhongliangshan Coalfield began construction on the 5th. This adit development project is an important component of the entire mine construction project. On the day of commencement, representatives from local government organs, people's organizations, and workers and peasants came to offer their congratulations. Drilling in the Zhongliangshan Coalfield near Chongqing began in 1950, and records and collections of climate, rainfall, hydrology and other data have been kept for several years. In 1954, roadway exploration was also carried out, and various coal samples were collected. This July, after the preliminary design was completed, the Second Engineering Department of the Chongqing Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau, which is responsible for the mine construction project in this coalfield, actively prepared for the adit development of the Zhongliangshan Coalfield. They overcame difficulties in work and life and finally completed the preparation of the construction organization design. At present, the preparatory work for the construction of other projects in this coalfield is also underway.

    中梁山南部煤田建设平洞
    在中梁山南部煤田上的一座平洞，已在五日开始建设。这个平洞开拓工程是整个矿井建设工程的重要组成部分。开工那天，当地政府机关、人民团体的代表和工人、农民代表都来祝贺。重庆附近的中梁山煤田在一九五零年时就开始钻探，同时记录和搜集了几年来的气候、雨量、水文等资料，一九五四年还进行了井巷勘探，搜集了各种煤样。今年七月，初步设计完成后，担负这个煤田矿井建设工程的重庆煤矿基本建设局第二工程处，就积极地为中梁山煤田的平洞开拓作准备。他们克服了工作、生活上的困难，终于完成了施工组织设计的编制工作。目前，这块煤田上其他工程的施工准备工作也在着手进行。
