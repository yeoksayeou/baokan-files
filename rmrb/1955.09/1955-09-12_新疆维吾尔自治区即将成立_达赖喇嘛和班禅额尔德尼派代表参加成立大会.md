    几年来，新疆省各族人民的政治、经济、文化事业都已有很大发展，在农业地区已经完成了民主改革的工作，各民族自治州、县已先后建立，本地的民族干部也已大批成长起来，建立新疆维吾尔自治区的条件已完全成熟。新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，将使自治区的各项建设事业得到进一步的发展。
    九月九日，乌鲁木齐市成立了各族人民庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年和新疆维吾尔自治区成立大会筹备委员会，并开始工作。现在，乌鲁木齐市数以百计的设计工作人员，正按照民族形式布置庆祝大会会场、观礼台和市街彩楼。公私商店也在装置彩灯。从九月六日开始，以汉、维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古四种文字出版的新疆日报，每天都以迎接维吾尔自治区为题出专刊，介绍新疆六年来各项建设事业的巨大成就。新疆省民族文艺工作团，正在排演各种节目，其中有新近创作的“感谢毛主席”。作为接待贵宾和代表的天山饭店、军区招待所、工会大楼、合作局大楼、燕儿窝干部休养所等地方，也已粉刷一新，正按照民族风习进行室内外的布置。数十名各民族的厨师都训练好了，他们将为各族贵宾炮制各自喜爱的美味。
    还在一个月以前，新疆省民族区域自治筹备委员会就从省、市各机关抽调了各族干部一百五十多人，积极进行在九月二十日召开的新疆省第一届第二次人民代表大会的各项准备工作。现在，大会的各项有关事宜都已准备完善。
