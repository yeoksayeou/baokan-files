    We Must Help Poorly Performing Agricultural Cooperatives Increase Production
    Li Yuènóng, Secretary of the CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee, Hebei Province
    In late July, we conducted a review of the production situation of agricultural cooperatives throughout the prefecture. The results were as follows: 65% of the agricultural production cooperatives in the prefecture produced more than individual farmers, but 27% of the cooperatives (4,528) produced about the same as individual farmers, and 8% of the cooperatives (1,312) produced less than the average individual farmer. This situation is serious. If we do not actively find ways to remedy it, not only will some cooperative members suffer economic losses, but it will also be very detrimental to the development of cooperatives this winter and next spring. At this time, it was already the "hoeing-up" season, but we believed that as long as we further strengthened specific leadership in production within the cooperatives and seriously solved the existing problems within the cooperatives, the vast majority of cooperatives could achieve increased production. Therefore, we immediately began to arrange this work.

    In early August, all counties in the prefecture universally convened a meeting of poorly performing agricultural cooperatives to study measures to increase production. The reasons for the failure to increase production were checked one by one for each cooperative. Through the method of advanced cooperatives introducing their experiences, measures to increase production were formulated for each cooperative. The 201 poorly performing cooperatives that participated in the meeting in Rongcheng and Zhuoxian counties, after everyone found reasons and thought of solutions, determined to immediately strengthen field management, artificially pollinate corn, apply fertilizer once to late corn, apply water fertilizer to sweet potatoes, remove false roots, and prune cotton twice more. After specifically calculating the results of strengthening field management, except for 16 cooperatives that still could not increase production, the rest could achieve increased production, and the output could exceed that of individual households. During the meeting, supply and marketing cooperatives provided cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer on credit to cooperatives with relatively weak economic strength in all counties. In Wangdu, Gaoyang, and other five counties alone, supply and marketing cooperatives provided over 17 million jin of fine fertilizer and chemical fertilizer on credit to poorly performing cooperatives.

    After the meeting, each county organized a large number of staff to go to the countryside and provide specific assistance to poorly performing cooperatives. According to statistics from Laiyuan, Dingxian, and other twelve counties, originally 31% of the cooperatives produced about the same as individual households. Due to the active assistance of the staff who went to the countryside in strengthening field management, two-thirds of them had exceeded the production of individual households by late August. The percentage of cooperatives whose production lagged behind individual households dropped from the original 9% to 3%. The superiority of agricultural cooperatives has been fully demonstrated.

    The fact that agricultural cooperatives changed from being unable to increase production to being able to increase production deeply moved many farmers outside the cooperatives. Many individual farmers have asked to join the cooperatives after the autumn harvest. According to statistics from Qingyuan County, more than 4,000 individual households have already "registered" with the cooperatives. Ma Zhenzong, a farmer from Beitaoxu Village in Boye County, voluntarily sent a bag of wheat to the cooperative to be used as seed, expressing his determination to join the cooperative after the autumn harvest.

    The above situation shows that the central issue in developing the agricultural cooperation movement is to actively help agricultural cooperatives increase production. We cannot sit idly by and watch the output of agricultural cooperatives be equal to or almost the same as that of individual households, let alone watch agricultural cooperatives reduce production. Facts have proved that as long as we earnestly strengthen specific leadership over agricultural cooperatives, we can enable agricultural cooperatives to increase production. Even if a situation of reduced production has initially formed, it can be reversed. Facts have also proved that as long as we can guarantee that agricultural cooperatives increase production, the vast majority of farmers will be attracted to agricultural cooperatives.

    必须帮助生产较差的农业合作社提高产量
    中共河北省保定地委书记　李悦农
    七月下旬，我们对全专区农业合作社的生产情况作了一次检查，结果是这样：占全专区农业生产合作社总数百分之六十五的社生产能超过单干农民，但是有百分之二十七的社（四千五百二十八个）生产同单干农民差不多，有百分之八的社（一千三百十二个）生产低于一般单干农民。这一情况是严重的，如不积极设法补救，不仅部分社员经济上要受到损失，而且对今冬明春发展社的工作非常不利。这时已到了“挂锄”季节，但我们认为：只要进一步加强社内生产的具体领导，认真解决社内存在的问题，是能够使绝大多数社达到增产的。于是，我们立即着手布置这一工作。
    八月初，全专区各县普遍召开了一次生产较差的农业合作社研究增产措施的会议，逐社检查了不能增产的原因，并通过先进社介绍经验的办法，逐社订出了增产措施。容城、涿县参加会议的二百零一个不能增产的社，经过大家找原因、想办法，确定立即加强田间管理，对玉米实行人工授粉，对晚玉米施一次追肥，对甘薯施水肥、去虚根，对棉花再整两次枝。具体计算加强田间管理后的结果，除尚有十六个社不能增产外，其余的都能达到增产，产量可以超过单干户。各县对于经济力量较薄弱的社，在开会期间都由供销合作社当场赊给了饼肥和化学肥料。仅望都、高阳等五县，由供销社赊给不能增产社的细肥、化学肥料即达一千七百多万斤。
    会议结束后，各县又组织大批工作人员下乡，深入不能增产的社内进行具体帮助。据涞源、定县等十二个县统计，原来有百分之三十一的社生产同单干户差不多，由于下乡工作人员积极协助这些社加强田间管理，其中三分之二到八月下旬生产都已超过单干户。生产落后于单干户的社，由原来的百分之九，降到百分之三。农业合作社的优越性充分地显示出来了。
    农业合作社由不能增产变成能增产的事实，使许多社外农民深受感动。不少单干农民纷纷要求秋后入社。据清苑县统计，已有四千多单干户向社里“挂了号”。博野县北陶绪村农民马振宗主动地把一袋麦子送到社里去，交给社做麦种，表示他秋后入社的决心。
    上述情况说明：发展农业合作化运动的中心问题，是积极地去帮助农业合作社，增加生产，不能坐视农业合作社的产量同单干户的产量相等或差不多，更不能坐视农业合作社减产。事实证明，只要我们认真地加强对农业合作社的具体领导，是能够使农业合作社增加生产的，即使已初步形成减产的局面，也是能够扭转的。事实也证明，只要我们能保证农业合作社增加生产，广大农民是会被吸引到农业社里来的。
