Xinhua News Agency dispatch, Moscow, September 9th, TASS: Bulganin's speech on September 9th at the negotiations between the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is as follows: Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!

On behalf of the Soviet government, I welcome you, Mr. Prime Minister, and the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, to Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union.

Prior to the negotiations that we are beginning today, the Soviet government exchanged notes with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. As you know, the Soviet government proposed to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to discuss the establishment of direct diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between our two countries.

The Soviet government believes that the establishment of normal relations between our two countries is in the interests of both the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The normalization of relations between our two countries is consistent with the task of consolidating peace in Europe and further easing international tensions, a matter of deep concern to both of our countries.

In the past two world wars, the Soviet and German peoples suffered the heaviest losses of life and the greatest material losses. The consequences of the enormous devastation caused by the last world war have not yet been completely eliminated. The losses of millions of families in the Soviet Union are even more painful, as they lost their loved ones in the heinous war of aggression launched by the Hitlerite invaders. This adventure also caused suffering to millions of German families. These losses are irreplaceable.

History convincingly shows that periods of hostility and estrangement between our two countries can only bring poverty and suffering to both of us. Conversely, if there are good mutual relations and cooperation between the two countries, the people of both countries often benefit greatly from this.

The people of other European countries also hope that the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will establish normal relations. They are rightly concerned to see that certain groups are planning to prevent the establishment of normal relations between our two countries, taking advantage of the lack of normal relations between us to sow hatred between the Soviet Union and West Germany. Such a plan harbours the danger of a new war in Europe, which is even more destructive, and threatens the security of the European people. Therefore, all those who seek to consolidate peace in Europe cannot but hope for the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

If normal relations are established based on trust and mutual respect for each other's interests, obstacles to peaceful cooperation between our two countries will be removed, thereby promoting the strengthening of the security of the people of Europe.

Despite the terrible sacrifices and destruction suffered by the Soviet people in the last war, they do not harbor animosity towards the German people. This is particularly illustrated by the fact that good and friendly relations have already been established between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, which are constantly developing and strengthening, based on the principles of equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

However, the Soviet government hopes that, as far as it depends on it, it will also maintain good relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. We believe that if we proceed from the interests of the Soviet and German peoples, and from the interests of maintaining peace in Europe, the establishment of such relations should not encounter any obstacles.

As everyone knows, the Geneva Four-Power Summit promoted the easing of international tensions. Now, the opportunities for countries to come closer to each other and establish the necessary trust have improved. This situation has naturally received widespread support and sympathy from the people of our two countries. This situation makes the normalization of relations between our two countries, and the establishment of direct diplomatic relations, even more urgent.

As everyone knows, the Soviet government has expressed its agreement to exchange views here on the issue of restoring German unity. At the same time, we cannot but pay attention to the serious obstacles created on this road after the entry into force of the Paris Accords, according to which the Federal Republic of Germany participated in certain military blocs, and West Germany is undergoing militarization. In addition, the following fact should also be emphasized: the Soviet government has always believed that the solution to the issue of restoring German unity is primarily a matter for the German people themselves, and in dealing with this matter, the co-existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, which is an established reality, must be taken into account, and the solution of this major task should be in accordance with the international agreements guaranteeing peace and European security. The Soviet side has been, and still is, unwavering in its support for the restoration of German unity, so that Germany becomes a peace-loving and democratic country.

The Soviet government expresses the hope that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will promote the resolution of outstanding issues of mutual interest. It cannot be overlooked that the lack of normal relations between our two countries adds considerable difficulties to the resolution of the main national issue of the German people - the reunification of Germany into a democratic state.

Based on the above, the Soviet government proposes that the Soviet Union establish diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, and that an agreement be reached on the establishment of embassies in Bonn and Moscow and the exchange of ambassadors between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Reaching the necessary agreements in this area will greatly promote the development of trade between our two countries. We suggest exchanging views on this issue as well. As everyone knows, trade between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is now very limited and unstable. However, it is currently possible to lay a solid trade foundation that is mutually beneficial to the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union. This would greatly expand trade volume in the coming years and develop mutually beneficial economic ties on the basis of corresponding long-term agreements.

The Soviet government also believes that the establishment and development of scientific, cultural, and technical cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is in the interests of the people of both countries. It is beneficial for delegations from both countries in industry, agriculture, trade, science, and culture, as well as sports delegations and tourists, to exchange visits.

These are the issues we hope to discuss in these negotiations. We put forward these considerations based on the fact that, during the exchange of notes, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany expressed its agreement to discuss the establishment of diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between our two countries, as well as issues related thereto.

Finally, please allow me to express the hope that our negotiations will achieve good results, and that the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will benefit the people of our two countries and strengthen peace and security in Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 10th, TASS dispatch: Negotiations between the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany continued at 10:00 AM on September 10th.

Federal Chancellor Adenauer presided.
