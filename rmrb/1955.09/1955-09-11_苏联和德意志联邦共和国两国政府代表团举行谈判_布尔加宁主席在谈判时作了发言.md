Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 10th, TASS dispatch: Negotiations between the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany were held in Moscow on the morning of September 9th at 11:00 AM.

The Soviet side participating in the negotiations included: Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin (head of the delegation), Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Khrushchev, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Pervukhin, Minister of Foreign Trade I.

Also participating in the negotiations were Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federal Council and Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia Arnold, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federal Parliament Kiesinger, and Vice Chairman Schmidt.

At the negotiations, N. A. Bulganin spoke first.

Subsequently, Federal Chancellor Adenauer spoke.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch, Moscow, September 9th, TASS: Bulganin's speech on September 9th at the negotiations between the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is as follows: Mr. Prime Minister, Gentlemen!

On behalf of the Soviet government, I welcome you, Mr. Prime Minister, and the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, to Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union.

Prior to the negotiations that we are beginning today, the Soviet government exchanged notes with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. As you know, the Soviet government proposed to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to discuss the establishment of direct diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between our two countries.

The Soviet government believes that the establishment of normal relations between our two countries is in the interests of both the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The normalization of relations between our two countries is consistent with the task of consolidating peace in Europe and further easing international tensions, a matter of deep concern to both of our countries.

In the past two world wars, the Soviet and German peoples suffered the heaviest losses of life and the greatest material losses. The consequences of the enormous devastation caused by the last world war have not yet been completely eliminated. The losses of millions of families in the Soviet Union are even more painful, as they lost their loved ones in the heinous war of aggression launched by the Hitlerite invaders. This adventure also caused suffering to millions of German families. These losses are irreplaceable.

History convincingly shows that periods of hostility and estrangement between our two countries can only bring poverty and suffering to both of us. Conversely, if there are good mutual relations and cooperation between the two countries, the people of both countries often benefit greatly from this.

The people of other European countries also hope that the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will establish normal relations. They are rightly concerned to see that certain groups are planning to prevent the establishment of normal relations between our two countries, taking advantage of the lack of normal relations between us to sow hatred between the Soviet Union and West Germany. Such a plan harbours the danger of a new war in Europe, which is even more destructive, and threatens the security of the European people. Therefore, all those who seek to consolidate peace in Europe cannot but hope for the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

If normal relations are established based on trust and mutual respect for each other's interests, obstacles to peaceful cooperation between our two countries will be removed, thereby promoting the strengthening of the security of the people of Europe.

Despite the terrible sacrifices and destruction suffered by the Soviet people in the last war, they do not harbor animosity towards the German people. This is particularly illustrated by the fact that good and friendly relations have already been established between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, which are constantly developing and strengthening, based on the principles of equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

However, the Soviet government hopes that, as far as it depends on it, it will also maintain good relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. We believe that if we proceed from the interests of the Soviet and German peoples, and from the interests of maintaining peace in Europe, the establishment of such relations should not encounter any obstacles.

As everyone knows, the Geneva Four-Power Summit promoted the easing of international tensions. Now, the opportunities for countries to come closer to each other and establish the necessary trust have improved. This situation has naturally received widespread support and sympathy from the people of our two countries. This situation makes the normalization of relations between our two countries, and the establishment of direct diplomatic relations, even more urgent.

As everyone knows, the Soviet government has expressed its agreement to exchange views here on the issue of restoring German unity. At the same time, we cannot but pay attention to the serious obstacles created on this road after the entry into force of the Paris Accords, according to which the Federal Republic of Germany participated in certain military blocs, and West Germany is undergoing militarization. In addition, the following fact should also be emphasized: the Soviet government has always believed that the solution to the issue of restoring German unity is primarily a matter for the German people themselves, and in dealing with this matter, the co-existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, which is an established reality, must be taken into account, and the solution of this major task should be in accordance with the international agreements guaranteeing peace and European security. The Soviet side has been, and still is, unwavering in its support for the restoration of German unity, so that Germany becomes a peace-loving and democratic country.

The Soviet government expresses the hope that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will promote the resolution of outstanding issues of mutual interest. It cannot be overlooked that the lack of normal relations between our two countries adds considerable difficulties to the resolution of the main national issue of the German people - the reunification of Germany into a democratic state.

Based on the above, the Soviet government proposes that the Soviet Union establish diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, and that an agreement be reached on the establishment of embassies in Bonn and Moscow and the exchange of ambassadors between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Reaching the necessary agreements in this area will greatly promote the development of trade between our two countries. We suggest exchanging views on this issue as well. As everyone knows, trade between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is now very limited and unstable. However, it is currently possible to lay a solid trade foundation that is mutually beneficial to the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union. This would greatly expand trade volume in the coming years and develop mutually beneficial economic ties on the basis of corresponding long-term agreements.

The Soviet government also believes that the establishment and development of scientific, cultural, and technical cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is in the interests of the people of both countries. It is beneficial for delegations from both countries in industry, agriculture, trade, science, and culture, as well as sports delegations and tourists, to exchange visits.

These are the issues we hope to discuss in these negotiations. We put forward these considerations based on the fact that, during the exchange of notes, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany expressed its agreement to discuss the establishment of diplomatic, trade, and cultural relations between our two countries, as well as issues related thereto.

Finally, please allow me to express the hope that our negotiations will achieve good results, and that the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany will benefit the people of our two countries and strengthen peace and security in Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 10th, TASS dispatch: Negotiations between the delegations of the governments of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany continued at 10:00 AM on September 10th.

Federal Chancellor Adenauer presided.

    苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团举行谈判
    布尔加宁主席在谈判时作了发言
    新华社十日讯　塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和德意志联邦共和国政府代表团九日上午十一时在莫斯科举行了谈判。
    谈判是根据苏联的倡议举行的，苏联曾经在六月七日的照会中提议要使苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系正常化，并且提议为此目的而讨论关于建立两国的直接外交关系、贸易关系和文化关系的问题。
    苏联方面参加谈判的有：部长会议主席布尔加宁（代表团团长）、最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫、部长会议第一副主席兼苏联外交部长莫洛托夫、部长会议第一副主席别尔乌辛、对外贸易部长伊·格·卡巴诺夫、外交部副部长谢苗诺夫。
    德意志联邦共和国方面参加谈判的有：联邦总理阿登纳（代表团团长）、外交部长勃伦塔诺、外交部副部长哈尔斯坦、联邦总理办公厅国务秘书格罗布克、大使布兰肯豪恩、某部司长格鲁、经济合作部对外经济司司长莱因哈特、外交部贸易政治司司长舒尔本堡、外交部文化司司长特卢兹舒勒、大使埃克哈特、外交部礼宾司公使衔司长摩尔、公使华尔特、某部司长缪勒和柯赫。
    参加谈判的还有联邦参议院外交委员会主席、北莱因威斯特伐利亚州总理阿诺德，联邦议院外交委员会主席基辛格和副主席施密特。
    谈判时尼·亚·布尔加宁首先发言。
    随后，联邦总理阿登纳发言。
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科九日电：布尔加宁九月九日在苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团谈判中发言，全文如下：总理先生，各位先生！
    我代表苏联政府，在苏联的首都莫斯科欢迎你们，总理先生和德意志联邦共和国政府代表团。
    在我们今天开始的这次谈判以前，苏联政府曾经同德意志联邦共和国政府互相交换过照会。正像你们所知道的，苏联政府向德意志联邦共和国政府提出建议，主张讨论我们两国建立直接的外交关系、贸易关系和文化关系的问题。
    苏联政府认为：我们两国建立正常关系是符合苏联和德意志联邦共和国的利益的。我们两国关系的正常化同巩固欧洲和平和进一步缓和国际紧张局势的任务是一致的，对于这一点，我们两国是不能不深切关怀的。
    在过去两次世界大战中，苏联和德国人民的生命损失最惨重，物质损失最巨大。上次世界大战所造成的巨大破坏的后果，到现在还没有完全消除。苏联千千万万家庭的损失就更加沉痛，希特勒侵略者所发动的罪恶战争冒险使他们失去了自己的亲人。这次冒险也给千千万万的德国家庭造成痛苦。这些损失是无可弥补的。
    历史令人信服地说明，我们两国之间存在着敌意和隔阂的时期只能给我们两国带来贫困和苦难。相反地，如果两国之间存在着良好的相互关系和合作，两国人民就经常从这里得到很大的好处。
    欧洲其他国家的人民也希望苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立正常关系。他们看到某些集团计划阻止我们两国建立正常关系，利用我们之间没有正常关系的空子在苏联和西德之间散布仇恨。他们对这种计划表示忧虑是完全有根据的。这样的计划孕育着破坏性更加厉害的欧洲新战争的危险，它威胁着欧洲人民的安全。因此，凡是要求巩固欧洲和平的人，都不能不希望苏联和德意志联邦共和国关系的正常化。
      如果建立起以信任和互相尊重对方利益为基础的正常关系，就会消除横在我们两国和平合作的道路上的障碍，从而促进欧洲各国人民安全的加强。
    尽管苏联人民在上一次大战中遭受了惨重的牺牲和破坏，他们对德国人民并不怀恶感。可以说明这一点的特别是：苏联同德意志民主共和国之间已经建立了良好、友善的关系，这种关系正在不断发展和巩固，它所依据的原则是平等、互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政。
    但是，苏联政府希望：只要事情取决于它，它就也要同德意志联邦共和国保持良好的关系。我们认为，如果从苏德两国人民的利益出发，从维护欧洲和平的利益出发，建立这种关系是应当不至于碰到任何阻碍的。
    大家知道，日内瓦四国政府首脑会议促进了国际局势的缓和。现在，各国彼此接近和建立必要的信任的机会已经改善了。这种情况很自然地受到了我们两国人民广泛的支持和同情。这种情况更迫切地要求我们两国关系的正常化，要求两国建立直接的外交关系。
    大家知道，苏联政府表示同意在这里就恢复德国统一问题交换意见。同时，我们不能不重视巴黎协定生效后在这条道路上所造成的那些严重的障碍，根据巴黎协定德意志联邦共和国参加了某一些军事集团，西德正在进行军国主义化。此外，还应当着重指出下列的事实：苏联政府一向认为德国恢复统一问题的解决首先是德国人民自己的事，在处理这件事时必须考虑到德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国同时并存这个既成的现实情况，而且，这个重大任务的解决应当符合保障和平和欧洲安全的各项国际协定。苏联方面过去是，现在仍是坚定不移地主张恢复德国统一，使德国成为爱好和平和民主的国家。
    苏联政府表示希望，苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间建立外交关系会促进同双方有利害关系的悬而未决的问题的解决。也不能不看到，我们两国之间缺乏正常的关系给解决德国人民主要的民族问题——使德国重新统一成为一个民主国家——增添了不少困难。
    根据上述情况，苏联政府建议：苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系，并且就苏联和德意志联邦共和国互相在波恩和莫斯科建立大使馆和互派大使的问题取得协议。
    彼此之间在这方面达成必要的协议，就会大大地促进我们两国贸易的发展。我们建议在这个问题上也交换一下意见。大家知道，苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的贸易现在是非常有限的，并且是不稳定的。然而，目前有可能奠立对德意志联邦共和国和苏联共同有利的巩固的贸易基础。这样一来，就可以在最近几年内大大扩大贸易额，并在相应的长期协定的基础上发展互利的经济联系。
    苏联政府还认为：在苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间建立和发展科学、文化、技术合作是符合我们两国人民的利益的。两国工业、农业、贸易、科学和文化代表团以及体育代表团和旅行者互相往来，是有好处的。
    我们希望在这次谈判中讨论的就是这样一些问题。我们提出这些考虑，是从这一点出发的：在交换照会的过程中，德意志联邦共和国政府曾经表示同意讨论在我们两国之间建立外交、贸易和文化关系的问题以及与此有关的一些问题。
    最后，请允许我表示希望我们的谈判会获得良好的结果，会使苏联和德意志联邦共和国的关系正常化，以利于我们两国人民，利于加强和平和欧洲的安全。
    新华社十日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和德意志联邦共和国政府代表团九月十日上午十时继续谈判。
    联邦总理阿登纳担任主席。
