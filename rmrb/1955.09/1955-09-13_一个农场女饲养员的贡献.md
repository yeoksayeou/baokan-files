	A Female Farm Breeder's Contribution
	Zhang Zheng

	During a sweltering noon in the autumn harvest season, Hua Yinfeng, a breeder at the Dongyang County Farm in Zhejiang, carried a newborn piglet out of the pigsty every few minutes. Squatting in the shade at the base of a straw stack, she carefully and skillfully removed the piglets’ membranes and umbilical cords, placing them in a basket. The lively piglets scurried around in the basket, filling Hua Yinfeng's heart with indescribable excitement; this year, together with her comrades, she had already delivered one hundred and ninety-eight piglets.

	Hua Yinfeng is an ordinary rural girl, born into a poor peasant family in Dongyang County. At the age of nine, because her family could not afford the rent and exorbitant taxes levied by the Kuomintang reactionaries, her parents painfully sold her to another family as a child bride. From then on, she spent her days fetching water, grinding flour, and chopping firewood, never having enough to eat during the day or sleep soundly at night. Her mother-in-law even poured cold water into her tattered cotton quilt and put wheat awns in it. Later, she was driven out of the house and lived alone in a dilapidated temple. It was not until after the liberation of Dongyang County and the implementation of land reform that Hua Yinfeng escaped from the pit of fire, truly living a human life and receiving human treatment. In February 1953, she was introduced by the township people's government to work as a pig breeder at the Dongyang County Farm. For more than two years, Hua Yinfeng has consistently loved her work and created scientific breeding methods, creating and saving considerable wealth for the country. In 1954, she was named a provincial agricultural labor model, elected as a representative to the Provincial People's Congress, and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China in November of the same year.

	After Hua Yinfeng entered the Dongyang County Farm, she was assigned to pig breeding. At that time, some people said: This work is dirty and smelly, and it has no "future." Her answer was: "There is no good or bad job. No matter what job it is, as long as you do it well and achieve results, it is a contribution to the country and the greatest future."

	For more than two years, Hua Yinfeng has consistently treated her work with this spirit. She has never complained about hardship in the face of work, nor has she lowered her head in the face of difficulties. She has always been wholeheartedly focused on doing her job well. Once, she saw a piglet fall into a manure pit, and she jumped into the pit without hesitation to pull the piglet out. Although she was covered in dirt and stench, she was overjoyed when she learned that the piglet could still be saved.

	This year, in order to improve the breed of pigs and produce more high-quality fat pigs, the farm gradually increased the number of sows. By the end of May, there were already twenty sows capable of breeding. This was still unfamiliar work for Hua Yinfeng, requiring her to familiarize herself with the sows' personalities and constitutions, and to take careful care of them before and after delivery. She was somewhat concerned about raising so many sows well. However, when she thought of what the leaders had told her: "Raising sows well can provide the country with more fat pigs, which can not only improve people's lives, but also exchange for machines to build the country," she put all her worries behind her. Last year, a very fierce sow crushed more than a dozen newborn piglets to death. Hua Yinfeng was so saddened by this that she couldn't eat for several days. Since then, she has taken even more careful care of each piglet. In the twenty-odd days from late May to mid-June this year, nine sows gave birth to ninety-nine piglets. Fearing that the piglets would be crushed again, Hua Yinfeng slept next to the pigsty for more than ten consecutive nights, carefully watching over them. One of the sows had an inflamed udder, and the piglets had no milk to eat after birth, and would starve to death in two days. Therefore, Hua Yinfeng mixed honey and brown sugar with boiling water, put it in a porcelain dish, and let the piglets eat it. For the piglets who didn't know how to eat, she patiently fed them spoonful by spoonful, and had to get up four or five times a night to feed them until the sow had milk. She also often noticed which piglets couldn't get milk, which piglets had problems, and what medicine they needed to take. If she didn't have time during the day, she would travel eighteen li at night to the town of Dongyang to get medicine, returning to the farm around two o'clock in the morning. Because of her meticulous care, the survival rate of piglets in the first half of this year reached 93.75 percent, and the piglets sold by the farm were also welcomed by the masses. On the morning of August 21, Hua Yinfeng and a technician carried six piglets to a small town five or six li away to sell. As soon as they arrived at the market, they were bought out by the masses; some villagers who didn't buy any even followed them back to the farm to buy them.

	Hua Yinfeng's pig breeding work was not done well all at once. Initially, she raised eighteen pigs, but because she had no experience, she was busy all day long but still couldn't raise them well. On average, each pig didn't even gain six liang of meat per day. Not being able to raise pigs well was the most distressing thing for her. She thought, if she couldn't even raise pigs well, how could she give full play to the locomotive role of the farm and set a good example for the peasants?

	Low cultural level and lack of scientific knowledge can affect pig breeding work. However, because Hua Yinfeng has a high sense of responsibility and studies diligently, she has gradually developed a relatively advanced breeding method. When feeding the pigs, she saw that the large pigs were抢了小猪的食 ("snatching the small pigs' food", or "eating the food meant for the small pigs") and the small pigs often couldn't get enough to eat, so she used the "group management" method to raise the pigs in different pigsties according to different breeds and sizes. She thought that to raise pigs well, she had to use the "fixed time and quantity" method to feed them. She often paid attention to keeping the pigsty clean, getting up early every morning to sweep it; when the weather was cold, she padded it with thick straw to prevent the pigs from getting cold. She fenced off a piece of land outside the pigsty, and released the pigs on time every day to let them move around. She also found ways to improve the breed of pigs and breed hybrid pigs. Hybrid breeds gain an average of six liang more meat per day than native breeds.

	With the development of the farm, more and more pigs were raised. In November 1953, Hua Yinfeng was responsible for raising ninety-six pigs by herself. The work was very heavy, requiring her to wash, cut, cook, and feed thousands of kilograms of feed every day, as well as many other tasks. But she didn't complain. While working from dawn to dusk, she actively improved her work methods. For example, she used to cut feed with a knife, but she changed to putting the feed in a large bucket and shoveling it with a shovel, which improved efficiency several times over. She used to carry water to wash green fodder from the pond bucket by bucket. She devised a way to draw water directly into the feed pot and filter it. As a result, it saved manpower and the water was clean. Although these improvements in working methods were very simple, they all cost her a lot of effort.

	She also put a lot of thought into the feed. She carefully observed the growth of the pigs, and appropriately matched the feed for them according to the different needs of various pigs. She often collected shells, snails, and eggshells, crushed them, and used them as mineral feed. Therefore, the pigs she raised never suffered from rickets. She also often paid attention to saving grain and reducing the cost of pig raising. For example, corn cobs were originally used as waste for burning, but she crushed them, stir-fried them, ground them into powder, and then cooked them to feed the pigs, and the effect was very good. She also used bran, pig grass, radish leaves, water lilies, and wheat husks to replace part of the barley and corn as feed. She said: "Grain is the treasure of treasures, and it must be kept for great use; there are dozens of kinds of feed that can be used to feed pigs. As long as you are willing to use your brain, there is a way." As a result of her careful calculation, in the fourth quarter of 1953 alone, she saved more than one hundred and twenty yuan for the state in terms of pig feed, and the average feeding cost per pig per day was reduced by more than one jiao. As a result of her and the efforts of the comrades in the animal husbandry team, the pig raising plan was overfulfilled by 40 percent in the first half of this year, with a surplus of 209 yuan, reversing the previous situation of losing money in pig raising. The meat growth rate of pigs has been increased to an average of more than nine liang and eight qian per pig per day.

	Hua Yinfeng's growth is inseparable from the cultivation of the Party and the help of comrades. When she was first responsible for pig breeding, the farm director Xing often studied the work with her and helped her make plans. Director Xing's words are still deeply imprinted in her mind: "Yinfeng, raising pigs well is our responsibility. Not raising pigs well is a loss to the farm and the country." In early December last year, some pigs in individual pigsties developed an epidemic disease, and the pigs' skin festered. At that time, a veterinarian living on the farm told her: This is a skin disease, not an epidemic disease. Hua Yinfeng didn't pay much attention to it, and treated it as a skin disease, only carrying out some simple disinfection work. But by mid-December, the pigs' condition not only did not improve, but became more and more serious. More than ninety pigs had contracted the epidemic disease. Some pigs had very high temperatures and lay motionless in the pigsty, not eating their food. Hua Yinfeng was so anxious that she couldn't even eat, thinking: If so many pigs die, what a great loss it would be to the country! She quickly sent a letter to the city to ask someone to treat them. At that time, the leaders of the farm were attending a meeting outside, and Jin, the chief of the Agricultural Section of the County People's Government, learned of the news and rushed to the farm that night in heavy snow to guide the rescue work. The workers in the farm also helped with isolation, disinfection, and other work. After several days of intense rescue, most of the pigs were saved.

	Hua Yinfeng also often asks the masses for advice on pig breeding experience. Last year, when the farm's pigs had skin diseases, the leaders of the farm assisted her in holding a peasant forum. At the meeting, the masses introduced that using mulberry leaves to pad the pigsty could treat the pig's skin diseases. After the meeting, Xu Baolian and others from Xinsheng Township also helped the farm to find mulberry leaves. After using this kind of leaf to pad the pigsty several times, the pig's skin diseases were cured. In addition, Hua Yinfeng also found many feeds that could be fed to pigs through the masses. For example, raising pigs with water lilies was found with the help of the masses. The method of giving pigs charcoal to help pigs digest and prevent pig diarrhea was also learned from the masses.

	She has deeply realized in her actual work that without the cultivation of the Party, without the care of the leadership, and without the help of the collective, one cannot do any work well.

    一个农场女饲养员的贡献
    张政
    在秋收季节的一个炎热的中午，浙江东阳县农场的饲养员华银凤，每隔几分钟就从猪舍里捧出一只刚出胎的仔猪。他蹲在稻草垛底下的荫凉处，小心地、熟练地把仔猪的黏膜、脐带去掉，放在箩里。活泼的仔猪在箩里乱窜，华银凤的心里说不出的兴奋；今年，她和同志们一起，已经接生了一百九十八只仔猪了。
    华银凤是一个平凡的农村姑娘，出生在东阳县一个贫农的家里，九岁的那年，因为家里交不起地租和国民党反动政府的苛捐杂税，父母忍痛地把她卖给了人家做童养媳。从此，她就成天挑水、推磨、砍柴，白天吃不饱，晚上睡不好，她婆婆甚至在她的破棉絮里浇冷水、放麦芒。后来还被赶出了家门，一个人住在破庙里。直到东阳县解放进行土地改革以后，华银凤才跳出了火坑，真正过着人的生活，受到人的待遇。一九五三年二月，由乡人民政府介绍她到东阳县农场做养猪工作。两年多来，由于华银凤一贯地热爱自己的工作，创造了科学的饲养方法，为国家创造和节约了不少财富，在一九五四年被评为全省的农业劳动模范，当选为省人民代表大会代表，并在同年十一月光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    华银凤进东阳县农场以后，就被分配做养猪工作。当时，有人说：这工作又脏、又臭，没有“出息”。她的回答是：“工作没有好坏，不管什么工作，只要好好去做，做出成绩来，就是对国家的贡献，就是最大的出息。”
    两年多来，华银凤一贯本着这种精神来对待自己的工作，从来没有在工作面前叫过苦，也没有在困难面前低过头，总是全神贯注地想把自己的工作作好。有一次，她看见一只小猪跌到粪坑里去了，她就毫不犹豫地跳到粪坑里把小猪捞起来。虽然弄得满身脏臭，但当她知道小猪还可以救活的时候，还是满心高兴。
    今年，农场里为了改良猪的品种，生产更多的优良的肥猪，逐步增养了一些母猪，到五月底已经有二十只能够生产的母猪了。这对华银凤来说，还是一件生疏的工作，需要熟悉母猪的性格、体质，并且要在产前、产后加以细心照顾。要养好这许多母猪，她是有些耽心的。但是，一想到领导同志告诉过她：“把母猪养好了，就能够供给国家更多的肥猪，不只可以改善人民生活，还可以换回机器来建设国家。”她就把什么顾虑都放在脑后了。去年，有一只很凶的母猪，把出生不久的十多只仔猪都压死了。华银凤为这件事难过得几天吃不下东西。从此以后，她就更加仔细地照顾每一只小猪。今年五月下旬到六月中的二十多天中，有九只母猪生产了九十九只仔猪，华银凤怕仔猪又被压死，她一连十几个晚上睡在猪栏旁边，小心地照管。有只母猪因为乳房发了炎，小猪生下来没有奶吃，两天就会饿死。于是，华银凤就用开水把蜂糖和红糖拌匀，放在一只磁盘里，让小猪吃。对于还不会吃的小猪，她就耐心地一匙一匙地喂，晚上也要起来喂四、五次，直到母猪有了奶为止。她还经常注意到哪只仔猪抢不到奶吃，哪只仔猪有毛病，需要吃什么药，她白天没有工夫，就在夜里赶十八里路，到东阳县城去配药，直到夜里两点左右才回到场里。由于她这样无微不至地照顾，今年上半年仔猪的成活率达到百分之九十三点七五，农场里卖出去的小猪也受到群众的欢迎。八月二十一日上午，华银凤和技术员挑着六只小猪，到五、六里路外的一个小镇上去卖，刚到市场就被群众买光了；有的老乡因为没有买到，还跟着他们回到农场里来买。
    华银凤的养猪工作，并不是一下子就做得很好的。最初，她饲养十八只猪，因为没有经验，虽然整天忙忙碌碌，还是养不好，平均每只猪每天还长不到六两肉。猪养不好，这是她最苦恼的一件事情。她想，连猪也养不好，怎么能发挥农场的火车头作用，给农民树立一个好的榜样呢？
    文化水平低，科学知识少，是会影响到养猪工作的。但是由于华银凤有高度的责任感，刻苦钻研，也就慢慢地研究出了一套比较先进的饲养方法。在给猪喂料的时候，她看见大猪抢了小猪的食，小猪经常吃不饱，她就用“分群管理”的办法，把猪按不同的猪种和大小分在各个猪栏里养。她想到要把猪养好，就得用“定时定量”的办法来喂料。她经常注意保持猪栏的清洁，每天大清早就起来打扫；天气冷的时候，就垫上厚厚的稻草，不使猪受冻。她在猪舍外面圈出了一块地方，每天都按时把猪放出来活动一下。她又想办法改良了猪种，繁殖杂交猪，杂交种比土种每天平均多长六两肉。
    随着农场的发展，猪越养越多了。一九五三年十一月，华银凤一个人负责养九十六只猪。工作是很繁重的，每天要洗、切、煮、喂千把斤饲料，还有其他的许多工作。但是她没有叫苦。她一面起早摸黑地干，一面积极地改进工作方法。例如，以前是用刀切饲料，她改为把饲料放在一个大桶里用铲子铲，效率提高了好几倍。以前洗青料的水，要一担一担地到池塘里挑，她想办法把水直接引到饲料锅里，并且经过过滤，结果是省了人力，水又干净。这些工作方法上的改进虽然很简单，但都化费了她不少心血。
    在饲料上，她也动了许多脑筋。她仔细地观察猪的生长情况，按照各种猪的不同的需要，适当地给它们搭配饲料。她经常搜集蚌壳、螺蛳、蛋壳，弄碎了作为矿物饲料，因而她养的猪从来没有得过软骨病。她还经常注意节约粮食，降低养猪的成本。例如，玉米心本来是作为废物烧火用的，她把它弄碎，炒过，磨成粉，再煮过用来喂猪，效果很好。她又用糠、猪草、萝卜菜叶、水荷花和小麦壳等物代替部分大麦、玉米当饲料。她说：“粮食是宝中之宝，要留着派大用场；可以喂猪的饲料有好几十种，只要肯动脑筋，就有办法。”她这样精打细算的结果，单是一九五三年第四季度，在猪的饲料方面就为国家节省了一百二十多元，平均每只猪每天的饲养费降低了一角多钱。她和畜牧组的同志努力的结果，今年上半年超额百分之四十完成了养猪计划，盈余二百零九元，扭转了过去养猪亏本的情况。猪的长肉率已经提高到平均每只猪每天长九两八钱多。
    华银凤的成长是同党的培养、同志们的帮助分不开的。她刚负责养猪工作的时候，农场的邢场长经常同她一起研究工作，帮助她订计划。邢场长的话直到现在还深深地印在她的脑子里：“银凤，养好猪是我们的责任，养不好猪对农场、对国家都是损失。”去年十二月初，个别猪栏的猪发生了疫病，猪的皮肤发烂。当时住在农场里的一位兽医对她说：这是皮肤病，不是疫病。华银凤也就大意过去，把它当作皮肤病来医，只进行了一些简单的消毒工作。但是到了十二月中旬，猪的病情不但没有好转，而且越来越严重了，有九十多只猪都染上了疫病，有些猪的体温很高，睡在猪栏里一动也不动，食料也不吃。这一下可把华银凤急坏了，她难过得连饭也吃不下，心想：如果这许多猪都死了，这对国家是多大的损失啊！她连忙带信到城里请人来医治。当时农场的领导同志正在外面开会，县人民政府农业科的金科长知道了这个消息，当天晚上就冒着大雪，赶到场去指导抢救工作。场里的工人也帮着进行隔离、消毒等工作。经过几天紧张的抢救，才把大部分猪挽救过来。
    华银凤还经常向群众请教养猪的经验。去年，当农场的猪生皮肤病的时候，农场的领导同志协助她召开了农民座谈会。会上，群众介绍了用构树叶垫栏，可以治疗猪的皮肤病；会后，新生乡的农民徐宝莲等人还帮助农场去找构树叶。用这种树叶垫了几次猪栏，就把猪的皮肤病治好了。此外，华银凤还通过群众找到了许多可以给猪吃的饲料。例如，用水荷花养猪，就是在群众的帮助下找到的。给猪吃木炭可以帮助猪消化、防止猪肚泻的办法，也是向群众学来的。
    她在实际工作中已经深深体会到，没有党的培养、没有领导上的关怀、没有集体力量的帮助，一个人是什么工作也搞不好的。
