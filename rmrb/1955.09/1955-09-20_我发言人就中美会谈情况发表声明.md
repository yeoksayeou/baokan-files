Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, September 19th: The spokesperson for the Chinese delegation participating in the Sino-American ambassadorial talks issued the following written statement to reporters on the 19th:

    Following the Sino-American ambassadorial talks on September 14th, Ambassador Johnson issued a statement regarding the talks, publicly revealing the issues under dispute. Ambassador Wang Bingnan regrets this and believes it is necessary to provide the following clarification:

    The Sino-American ambassadorial talks were realized through the mediation of India, Britain, and other countries. At the beginning of the talks, China and the United States reached an agreement on the content stipulated in the conference announcement, using "the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries" and "certain other practical issues in dispute between the two sides" as the two agenda items of the talks. Now, both sides have reached an agreement on the first agenda item. According to the conventions of international conferences, the talks should immediately enter into discussions on the second agenda item. However, Ambassador Johnson said in his public statement: "It would be premature to discuss other issues before the agreed-upon statement regarding the repatriation of civilians is fulfilled."

    If Ambassador Johnson's public statement implies that the talks will not be able to discuss other issues before the agreement is fully implemented, then, given the large number of Chinese citizens in the United States, and the lengthy period it will take for all Chinese in the U.S. who wish to return to China to do so, Sino-American talks will be fundamentally impossible during this long period. This statement is unreasonable and unheard of in any international conference.

    China adheres to the agreements it has reached. After the Sino-American talks reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their respective countries, the Chinese side has already notified the U.S. side of the results of the reviews completed in cases involving Americans who violated the law in China. These Americans have begun to leave China successively. On the other hand, although none of the many Chinese citizens whom the U.S. side admitted in the talks had applied to return home but were prevented from doing so by the U.S. government have returned to China so far, we do not consider this an obstacle to continuing the discussion of the second agenda item, understanding that the implementation of the agreement requires a certain amount of time.

    According to the agreed-upon agenda, Ambassador Wang Bingnan already raised the "embargo issue" and the "issue of preparing for higher-level Sino-American negotiations" during the talks on September 14th. The Chinese side believes that the talks should proceed without delay into the discussion of these issues in order to contribute to easing the tension between China and the United States.

### 我发言人就中美会谈情况发表声明

    我发言人就中美会谈情况发表声明
    新华社日内瓦十九日电　参加中美两国大使级会谈的中国代表团发言人十九日向记者发表书面声明如下：
    九月十四日中美两国大使级会谈后，约翰逊大使对会谈情况发表声明，公开了会谈中争论的问题。对此王炳南大使感到遗憾，并认为有必要作如下说明：
    中美两国大使级的会谈是印度、英国和其他国家从中斡旋而实现的。在会谈开始的时候，中美双方就按会谈公告所规定的内容达成了协议，以“双方平民回国问题”和“双方有所争执的某些其他实际问题”作为会谈的两项议程。现在，双方对于第一项议程已经达成了协议，根据国际会议的常规，会谈应该立即进入第二项议程的讨论。但是，约翰逊大使在他发表的公开声明中却说：“在达成协议的关于遣返平民的声明得到履行之前，讨论其他问题未免为时过早。”
    如果约翰逊大使公开声明的含意是说，在协议实施完毕以前，会谈将不能讨论其他问题，那末，中国在美国的侨民很多，全部愿意回国的在美中国人回到中国将是一个长时期的问题，而在这一长时期中，中美会谈将根本无法进行。这种说法是没有任何道理的，也是任何国际会议中所没有听说过的。
    中国方面是遵守它所达成的协议的。中美会谈就双方平民回国问题达成协议后，中国方面已经将在中国犯法的美国人的案件中已经审查完毕的结果向美方作了通知。这些美国人已开始陆续离开中国。另一方面，虽然美方在会谈中所承认的、曾经申请回国而被美国政府阻止不能回国的许多中国人中，至今还没有一个人回到中国；由于了解到协议的实施需要一定的时间，我们并没有认为这是继续讨论第二项议程的障碍。
    根据双方协议的议程，王炳南大使已经在九月十四日的会谈中提出了“禁运问题”和“准备更高一级的中美谈判问题”。中国方面认为，会谈应该不再迟延地进入这些问题的讨论，以便对和缓中美之间的紧张局势作出贡献。
