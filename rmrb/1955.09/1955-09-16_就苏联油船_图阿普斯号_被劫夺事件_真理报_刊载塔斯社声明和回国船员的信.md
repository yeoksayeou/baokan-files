Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: "Pravda" published on September 15th, regarding the hijacking of the Soviet tanker "Tuapse," a TASS statement and a letter to the "Pravda" editorial department, jointly written by the ship's captain Kalinin and seven crew members, entrusted by a group of returned "Tuapse" crew members.

    The TASS statement mentioned the circumstances of the hijacking of the "Tuapse" tanker on June 23, 1954, and also discussed the measures taken by the Soviet government to negotiate the release of the Soviet sailors. As a result of these measures, 29 crew members were released in July 1955.

    The TASS statement also stated that a portion of the "Tuapse" tanker's crew—twenty people—are still being forcibly detained on Taiwan Island. To this end, the Soviet Embassy in Washington submitted a memorandum to the U.S. State Department on August 8, 1955, pointing out that the Soviet government was disturbed by the detention of twenty crew members of the "Tuapse" tanker and the oil tanker itself. The Soviet government hoped that the U.S. government would take necessary measures to release the Soviet sailors and the oil tanker. At the same time, the Soviet government requested the French government to continue its efforts to secure the release of the crew members and the oil tanker "Tuapse" detained in Taiwan.

    The Soviet people expect that all the Soviet sailors detained in Taiwan will be freed, and that the "Tuapse" oil tanker will be able to return to the Soviet Black Sea fleet.

    The Soviet sailors who were released from Taiwan and returned to the Soviet Union, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet government, described the hijacking of the "Tuapse" tanker in a letter to the "Pravda" editorial department. They also talked about how, when they were detained in Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities used all kinds of intimidation and humiliation to force them to abandon their desire to return to their country.

    The letter continued, the secret agents of Chiang Kai-shek's espionage organization, with the help of a group of instigators, tried their best to instill their ideas in us, trying to make us believe that the Soviet Union had abandoned us. However, the thought of our Soviet motherland supported our spirit and will. We believed that the Soviet government would not let us fall into danger, but would try its best to set us free. This belief was further strengthened when the French Chargé d'Affaires in Taiwan came to inspect the place where we were imprisoned. From him we learned that the Soviet government had requested the French government to take care of our fate and help us get released. The Soviet government provided us with money and sent us food and Soviet newspapers.

    We express our warm gratitude to our dear Soviet government for making it possible for us to return to the land of our motherland and to the big family of the Soviet people. We would also like to thank the representatives of the French authorities who helped facilitate our release, the Swedish Red Cross, and the public in various countries, for rising up to protest against the insults suffered by us and the sailors of other countries who were trapped in Taiwan's torture chambers.

    We were deeply moved by the warm welcome we received from our dear capital, our motherland, and our dear city of Odessa.

    However, after returning to our motherland, we still cannot forget that twenty of our comrades are still being forcibly detained in Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek elements continue to detain them on provocative pretexts, insisting that they "intend to seek asylum there." However, none of us had the opportunity to meet with the rest of the crew before we left. The Chiang Kai-shek elements are afraid of the truth: all the Soviet sailors who are still being detained in Taiwan to this day hope to return to their motherland.

    The letter concluded by saying that all the Soviet sailors detained in Taiwan should be released. Our "Tuapse" oil tanker should also return to the ranks of the Soviet merchant fleet.

    就苏联油船“图阿普斯号”被劫夺事件
    “真理报”刊载塔斯社声明和回国船员的信
    新华社十五日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：“真理报”十五日就苏联“图阿普斯号”油船被劫夺的问题刊载了塔斯社的声明和油船船长卡里宁及七名船员受回到苏联的一批油船船员的委托联名写给“真理报”编辑部的一封信。
    塔斯社的声明提到一九五四年六月二十三日
  “图阿普斯号”油船被劫夺的情况，还讲到苏联政府交涉释放苏联海员所采取的措施，由于这种措施，有二十九名船员在一九五五年七月被释放了。
    塔斯社声明还说，“图阿普斯号”油船的一部分船员——二十个人，仍然被强迫扣留在台湾岛。为此，苏联驻华盛顿大使馆曾在一九五五年八月八日向美国国务院提出一份备忘录，指出苏联政府对于“图阿普斯号”油船二十名船员和油船的被拘留感到不安，苏联政府希望美国政府采取必要措施以释放苏联海员和油船。同时苏联政府请求法国政府继续努力，争取释放被扣留在台湾的“图阿普斯号”油船的船员和油船。
    苏联人民期待着，所有被扣留在台湾的苏联海员都能够获得自由，而“图阿普斯号”油船能够重新回到苏联的黑海船队中。
    由于苏联政府的努力而自台湾被释放归国的苏联海员在给“真理报”编辑部的信中叙述了“图阿普斯号”油船被抢劫的经过，并且谈到他们被拘禁在台湾时蒋介石当局为了强迫他们放弃回国的愿望怎样对他们进行了种种恫吓和侮辱。
    信中接着说道，蒋介石间谍机关的特务在一群挑拨离间分子的帮助下极力给我们灌输他们的思想，想叫我们相信苏联已经抛弃了我们。但是，我们一想起苏维埃祖国，我们的精神和意志就得到了支持。我们相信，苏联政府不会听任我们陷于危难，而是会极力设法使我们获得自由。当法国驻台湾临时代办来察看我们被囚禁的地方时，我们的这种信念就更加巩固了。从他那里我们知道，苏联政府已经请求法国政府负责照顾我们的命运，并且协助我们获释。苏联政府供给了我们金钱，寄来了粮食和苏联的书报。
    我们向我们亲爱的苏联政府表示热烈的感激，感谢它使我们重新回到祖国的土地上，回到苏联人的大家庭里。我们也要感谢协力促使我们获释的法国当局的代表，感谢瑞典红十字会和世界各国的公众，因为它们起来对我们和对陷入台湾酷刑室的其他国家的海员所遭到的侮辱表示抗议。
    亲爱的首都、祖国和我们亲爱的敖德萨市对我们的热忱欢迎，使我们十分感动。
    但是，我们在回到祖国之后，依然不能忘记，我们的二十个同志仍被强迫拘留在台湾。蒋介石分子继续用挑衅性的借口拘留着他们，硬说什么他们“打算请求在那边避难”。但是，我们这批人在出发前，谁也没有机会同其余的船员会晤。蒋介石分子害怕真相：到目前为止还被拘留在台湾的全体苏联海员都希望回祖国。
    信中最后说，被拘留在台湾的全体苏联海员都应当获得释放。我们的“图阿普斯号”油船也应当回到苏联商船队的队伍里。
