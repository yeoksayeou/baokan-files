Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The National Youth Socialist Construction Activists' Conference continued into its fourth day. The Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Lai Ruoyu, attended the conference and delivered a speech. He expressed his hope that the worker and farmer representatives attending the conference would interact more, and discuss their work and living conditions in detail. He hoped that they would form close and intimate friendships, and maintain close contact even after the conference. Lai Ruoyu said: Youth socialist construction activists must firmly remember a very important principle, which is that our socialist construction cause must rely on a consolidated worker-peasant alliance. Strengthening and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance naturally mainly relies on the policies of the Party and the state, but direct interactions and contact between workers and peasants are also very important.

At today's conference, the head of the Vietnamese Youth Delegation, Huang Van Dinh, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese National Salvation Youth League, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the Vietnamese youth and presented gifts. The gifts included: a red flag embroidered with the emblem of the Vietnamese National Salvation Youth League and the words "Congratulations to the Chinese youth on their victory in the socialist construction competition," a portrait of Chairman Mao, and many congratulatory letters from youths in various parts of Vietnam to the conference. The youth activists warmly applauded to thank the Vietnamese youth for their congratulations and presented flowers to the Vietnamese Youth Delegation.

During breaks in today's conference, youth activists danced group dances in the halls and lounges, and songs rose and fell throughout the venue.

Sixteen youth activists spoke at the conference today. The last speaker, Luo Zongxian, a youth literary and artistic worker from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, sang two of his new songs, "To Realize a Thousand-Year Dream" and "Happiness Blossoms for Ten Thousand Years," accompanied by an accordion at the end of his speech. At this time, the entire audience responded by singing "Ode to the Motherland".

As the meeting was about to adjourn, representatives of the Young Pioneers from the First Primary School Affiliated to Beijing Normal School came to congratulate the conference and present gifts. As soon as the Young Pioneer representative finished reading the congratulatory message, he was enthusiastically picked up by the youth activists on the rostrum amidst warm applause. Members of the Soviet Youth Delegation also ran up to pin Soviet Young Pioneer emblems on the children's chests.

Today, the conference received 510 congratulatory letters from youth across the country, as well as many congratulatory telegrams and gifts. Many young people on the industrial and agricultural fronts reported their achievements to the conference.

He reported on his pig breeding achievements. In 1954, he actively responded to the government's call to increase pork production.

The pigs he raised could give birth to more than twenty piglets per litter. In his speech, he expressed his desire to become a livestock breeding expert and contribute to the great rural cooperativization movement.

Wang Xicheng, a freight handler from the Xuchang Food Company in Henan Province, reported on his experiment of loading pigs in four layers on trains and setting a new national record by transporting 9,199 pigs in twenty-nine months without any casualties. He felt that his work served the needs of the people and the industrialization of the country, and he would continue to find ways to reduce the loss rate of live pig transportation.

Wang Furong, the head cook of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's cooking team, who has been a cook for twelve years, has researched and created many kinds of cooking and vegetable cutting tools and food varieties in three years to ensure the health of the workers. He proposed to save more grain on the basis of ensuring that everyone is well-fed and work hard not to waste a single grain of rice.

Also reporting to the country at today's conference were Sun Shigui, the young train driver who created the "rapid fire starting method," Xu Renwu, a labor model from Jinan City and a technician at the Shandong Chemical Plant, Song Chunkui, a labor model from Xinhailian City, Jiangsu Province and a tractor driver at the state-owned Dongxin Farm, Niu Guizhi, the leader of the women's production team of the "Happiness Road" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, Yang Xixian, a model of agricultural tool improvement from Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, Xiong Guanghua, a Miao youth militiaman from Yunnan Province who assisted the border guards in clearing out bandits, and Yang Boxun, a people's police officer from Chongqing who was awarded the title of "Excellent League Member."
