    Sincere Friendship and Excellent Art
    Lou Shiyi
    The visit to China by the Burmese Cultural Delegation, headed by the Minister of Culture of the Union of Burma, U Win, and including many famous Burmese writers and artists, is a manifestation of the increasingly close cultural cooperation between China and Burma, and is of great significance for promoting the close friendship between the people of our two countries.
    Burma and China share more than a thousand kilometers of close border. Like the waters of the Nujiang River and the Irrawaddy River, the friendship and cultural exchange between the people of the two countries have a very long history. When the Chinese Cultural Delegation visited Burma this January, we had a deeper appreciation for this precious historical friendship, and the mutual goodwill expressed by the people of the two countries after they had shaken off the shackles of Western colonialism and gained freedom and independence. During our visit to Burma, we were warmly welcomed and given grand and cordial hospitality by the government and people wherever we went. Even in places we could not visit due to the itinerary, many people traveled by plane and train from afar to participate in our reception and attend our performance evenings. The Minister of Culture, U Win, who headed the current cultural delegation, was our enthusiastic host. During our visit to Rangoon, he accompanied us almost every day, visiting, touring, and attending various welcome, reception, and performance gatherings, establishing close friendships with each member of our delegation. Many artists, young men and women, and even children, also became the best of friends with our delegation members during our brief visit. This most beautiful expression of human affection between the peace-loving people of the two countries is unforgettable to us forever.
    Equally unforgettable is the achievement of Burmese culture and art with a long tradition and novel creation that we personally came into contact with during our visit. In Rangoon and Mandalay, we saw glittering pagodas everywhere, magnificent and splendid historical, religious, and artistic buildings, which made us constantly marvel at the perseverance and creative talent of the Burmese people. We also saw many musical and dance art performances specially arranged for us by our Burmese friends, and their rich, beautiful, profound, and novel colors and emotions inspired us greatly. The tones and colors of Burmese music are both beautiful and varied. Among the instruments, the "Saung Gauk" and the "harp," as the main music, particularly aroused great interest in us who had just come into contact with this national art. In a circular silver-inlaid balustrade, more than a dozen leather drums of different sizes are arranged. The performer stands in this drum array and strikes the drums with both hands like playing the piano. The rhythm is sometimes high and majestic like ten thousand horses galloping, and sometimes low and choked like a flowing stream. The form of the "harp" is also very beautiful. On the magnificent boat-shaped harp plate, a crane-neck-like curved string column extends, with thirteen strings stretched on it like a sail. The performer puts the harp plate on his knees and holds the harp with both hands, plucking the strings with his fingers, emitting a tinkling sound. The timbre is very quiet, leading people into a dreamlike world of art. Another distinctive instrument is the "bamboo xylophone," which is made of twenty or so pieces of bamboo that have been refined for a long time, arranged into a row of keys and suspended on a wooden frame, and played by hitting it with two small hammers. When we first saw this simple instrument, we never thought that the sound it made would be as magnificent and elegant as a piano. In addition, many instruments, cymbals, flutes, bamboo boards that make a sound by striking two halves of bamboo joints, and suonas with slightly downward-facing trumpets, are very similar to Chinese instruments, making us feel particularly kind. Burmese music performances also absorb some Western modern wind instruments, and create scenes that use makeup and stage settings to match the mood of the performance. At Prime Minister U Nu's reception, we enjoyed an ensemble program arranged as a paradise scene. The artist U Ba Than, who played the main music, was dressed as a god, holding a curved harp and sitting high in the clouds. Many performers, dressed as fairies and angels, used various instruments to accompany the performance in the misty white clouds. It was truly "this music should only be found in heaven," which left us with a deep impression. Burmese vocal music is also very amazing. Modern songs, like "In the Golden Land," which our delegation's mezzo-soprano soloist, Ms. Dong Ailin, learned in Burma, describes the joy of farmers' labor and the desire for mutual assistance, and the lyrics are very fresh and healthy. The singing of many soloists we have admired has a deep foundation of strength in its simplicity. Each performer's program is very rich, and they can continue to sing continuously at an evening, rolling on like flowing water, and its variety can make the audience feel more and more novel and inspired as they listen.
    Burmese dance is also very beautiful, delicate, elegant, and full of musical beauty. Its characteristic is that the content is generally very narrative. Whether it is performing religious, mythological, or people's labor and game life stories, even if the audience is not familiar with the performance program in advance, they can understand the progress of the plot from the changes in the dance postures. The second feature is that most of the dances, whether group dances, duets, or solo dances, are often performed with singing and dancing, or there are two clowns standing next to the dancers, using humorous songs and dialogues, while doing stand-up comedy with the dancers during the intermission of the dance, while explaining the plot to the audience, or improvising, and making various humorous performances. Another very important feature is that the rhythm of the dance is very clear. The stretching and rotating movements of the arms, body, and legs change rapidly or circuitously with the rhythm of the music and lyrics, making people feel harmonious and coordinated. The costumes of the dancers are also very gorgeous. Male gods and goddesses in classical dance generally wear tall crowns with pointed tops like Western Gothic architecture. This tall crown is also very similar to the pagodas in Burmese religious architecture. The costumes of male gods are generally very similar to the short armor of martial roles in Chinese Peking Opera. The elbows are decorated with small wings, which give people the feeling of riding the clouds when the arms are used. The "longyi" worn by female dancers trails on the ground, making them feel more graceful and gentle as they advance and retreat.
    During its short visit to Burma, the Chinese Cultural Delegation developed a strong love for Burmese music and dance art. Under the cordial and tireless guidance of Burmese artists, our musicians learned to play the curved harp and the zither, the singers learned "Burma-China Friendship Song" and "In the Golden Land," and the young artists of the dance troupe learned classical solo dances, duets, sowing dances, and folk dance "Flowers of Mandalay." We brought these programs and the Burmese people's friendly enthusiasm for New China back to our motherland. But what we are even more eagerly awaiting is the friendly and precious achievements of Burmese culture and art brought by our Burmese friends themselves.
    Now, the Chinese people, like we felt in Burma, can personally feel the sincere and warm friendship of the friendly envoys of the neighboring country and their excellent artistic performances. Through their outstanding artistic performances, the people of the two countries will further consolidate and develop our close friendship built on the common desire to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

    真挚的友谊和优秀的艺术
    楼适夷
    以缅甸联邦政府文化部部长吴温为首、包括许多缅甸著名作家和艺术家的文化代表团的访问我国，是中缅两国文化合作日益密切的表现，对于促进我们两国人民间的亲密友谊具有重大意义。
    缅甸和中国有一千多公里密接的疆界，正如怒江同伊洛瓦底江的流水一样，两国人民友谊和文化的交流，已经有非常悠久的历史。当今年一月间，中国文化代表团访问缅甸的时候，我们对于这种宝贵的历史友谊，和两国人民在摆脱了西方殖民主义者的奴役获得了自由和独立以后所表示的相互的友好，更有深刻的感受。在我们访问缅甸的日子里，凡是我们所到达的地方，都受到政府和人民的热烈的欢迎和隆重、亲切的接待，甚至因为行程的关系我们不能访问到的地方，也有很多的人特地乘飞机、搭火车从远道赶来参加对我们的接待和出席我们的表演晚会。这次任文化代表团团长的文化部部长吴温，正是我们的热情的主人。当我们在仰光访问活动期间，他几乎天天陪着我们，一起访问、参观、游览，出席各种欢迎、招待和表演的集会，同我们每个团员建立了亲密的友谊。很多艺术家、青年男女、甚至小朋友们，也在我们短促的访问期间，同我们的团员结成了最好的朋友。这种在爱好和平的两国人民之间，所表现的人与人的最美丽的感情，是使我们永远难忘的。
    同样使我们难忘的，是我们在访问期间所亲身接触到的具有悠久传统和新颖创造的缅甸文化艺术的成就。在仰光、在曼德勒，我们到处看到金光灿烂的宝塔，雄浑、富丽的历史的、宗教和艺术的建筑，使我们对缅甸人民劳动的毅力和创造的才能不住地发出惊叹。我们又看到了缅甸友人特地招待我们的许多音乐和舞蹈的艺术表演，它们的丰富、优美、精深和新颖的色调和情愫使我们受到很大的感奋。缅甸音乐的音调和色彩，都是美丽而多姿的。在乐器中，作为主乐的“套鼓”和“弯琴”，特别使刚刚接触到这种民族艺术的我们感到极大的兴趣。在一座圆形镶银的雕栏中，排列着十几面大小不同的皮鼓，演奏者处身在这个鼓阵中，用两手像奏钢琴一样打击这些鼓，奏出的节调时而高昂雄伟像万马奔腾，时而低沉哽咽像小溪流水一般。“弯琴”的形式也非常美丽，在金碧辉煌的舟形的琴盘上，伸起一条鹤颈一般的弯弯的弦柱，上面像风帆一般张着十三条琴弦，演奏者把琴盘放在膝上，两手抱琴用指头撩拨琴弦，发出琤琮的声音，音色非常幽静，引人进入到梦一般的艺术的世界。另外一种富于特色的乐器是“竹琴”，用二十几片经过长期炼制的竹片编成一排琴键，悬在木制的琴架上，用两个小锤打击演奏的。当我们第一次看到这种朴质的乐器时，无论如何想不到它发出来的声音竟同钢琴一样的富丽和幽雅。此外很多的乐器，钹、笛、用两半片竹节打击作声的竹板，喇叭口略略向下的唢呐，都同中国的乐器非常相似，使我们感到特别的亲切。缅甸音乐演奏中还吸收一些西洋近代的管乐器，和创制用化装和舞台装置配合演奏情调的场景。在吴努总理的招待会上，我们欣赏过一个布置成天堂景色的合奏节目。演奏主乐的艺术家吴巴丹作天神装束，怀抱弯琴，高坐云端，很多的演奏者，扮成仙女和天使的样子，在白云霭霭中，用各种乐器配合演奏，真是“此曲只应天上有”，尤令我们留下深刻的印象。缅甸的声乐也非常使人惊异，近代的歌曲，像我们代表团的女中音独唱家董爱琳女士在缅甸学到的“在黄金的土地上”，描写农民劳动的欢乐和互助的愿望，歌词都非常清新健康。许多我们欣赏过的独唱家的歌唱，都在平易中具有深沉的底力。每个演唱者的节目都非常丰富，能够在一个晚会上接连不断地一直唱下去，像流水一样地滚滚不绝，而它的变化多采，却又能使听众愈听愈感到新颖和奋发。
    缅甸的舞蹈也非常的清丽、细致、典雅和富于音乐的美。它的特色一般是内容故事性很强，无论表演宗教、神话或人民劳动和游戏的生活故事，即使对表演的节目事先并不熟悉，观众也可以从舞姿的变化中理解故事情节的进展。第二种特色，是大部分的舞蹈，不论群舞、对舞、独舞，往往是载歌载舞的，或者是在舞蹈者的旁边，站着两个小丑，用幽默的歌唱和对白，一边在舞蹈的间歇中同舞者对口相声，一边向观众作剧情的说明，或是即景生情，作种种滑稽的演述。另一个也是很重要的特色，便是舞蹈的节奏性非常明确，手臂、身段和腿部的伸曲旋转的动作，随着乐声和歌词的节拍，作种种迅速的或迂回的变化，使人感到谐和与协调。舞蹈者的装束也非常绚烂。古典舞的男神和女神，一般戴着像西洋峨特式建筑的尖顶的高冠，这种高冠也很像缅甸宗教建筑中的宝塔。男神的服装一般很像中国京剧中武生的短靠，手肘上装饰着小小的翅膀，在两臂运用的时候，令人有驾云御风之感。女舞蹈者所穿的“笼格”，长曳地面，在进退起伏之中，愈加显出婀娜柔和的感觉。
    中国文化代表团在访缅的短时期中，对缅甸的音乐舞蹈艺术发生了强烈的爱好。在缅甸艺术家亲切的孜孜不倦的指导之下，我们的音乐家学会了弯琴与箧琴的演奏，歌唱家学会了“缅中友好歌”和“在黄金的土地上”，舞蹈队的青年艺术家们学会了古典的单人舞、双人舞、播种舞和民间舞蹈“曼德勒的花朵”。我们把这些节目和缅甸人民对新中国的友好的热情一起带回到祖国来了，但是我们更加热烈期待的，是由我们的缅甸友人亲自带来的缅甸人民的友好和缅甸人民的文化和艺术的宝贵成果。
    现在，中国人民同我们在缅甸时期所感受到的一样，能够亲身感受到邻邦友好使节们所带来的缅甸人民的真挚和热烈的友谊和他们的优秀的艺术表演。通过他们的卓越的艺术表演，两国人民将更加巩固和发展我们建筑在保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同愿望上的亲密友谊。
