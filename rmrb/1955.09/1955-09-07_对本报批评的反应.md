    Response to Criticism from This Newspaper

    On June 21st, this newspaper published an article titled "Why the Shanxi Provincial Food Company Lost Money," criticizing the Shanxi Provincial Food Company's leadership for failing to promptly investigate and address the serious chaos in management and the dereliction of duty by some staff, which resulted in the company losing a lot of money. Now, Wang Hao, the manager of the Shanxi Provincial Food Company, has sent a letter of self-criticism and proposed improvement measures. The Ningwu County Company mentioned in the criticism is under the business leadership of the Xin County Branch, while personnel transfers, rewards, and punishments are under the leadership of Ningwu County; although the business operations of the Yuci Branch are directly led by the Provincial Company, personnel matters are under the leadership of the Yuci Special District. They have recommended that the relevant leading departments seriously handle the dereliction of duty by personnel involved in the dead cattle incident in these two companies.

    对本报批评的反应
    六月二十一日本报发表了“山西省食品公司为什么赔了钱”一文，批评山西省食品公司领导人员对经营管理中的严重混乱和某些工作人员的失职，一直没有及时检查处理，致使公司赔了许多钱。现在，山西省食品公司经理王浩已来信检讨并提出了改进措施。批评中提到的宁武县公司，业务上属忻县分公司领导，人事调动奖惩工作则属宁武县领导；榆次分公司业务工作虽属省公司直接领导，人事工作则属榆次专区领导。这两公司发生死牛事故的失职人员，他们已建议有关领导部门严肃处理。
