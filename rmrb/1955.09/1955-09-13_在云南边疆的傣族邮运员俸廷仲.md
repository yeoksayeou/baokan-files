Dai Postal Worker Feng Tingzhong on the Yunnan Frontier

In the mountains and forests of the border counties of Lincang, Gengma, and Cangyuan in southwestern Yunnan, a young man frequently treads the muddy roads, carrying mail, laboriously crossing one mountain after another. He is Feng Tingzhong, a young Dai postal worker.

In December 1952, Feng Tingzhong was transferred to work at the Lincang County Post and Telecommunications Bureau.

This area is inhabited by Dai, Kawa, Lahu and other ethnic groups. The towering mountains block traffic with the interior. In July 1953, the People's Government decided to open a postal route from Lincang to Gengma.

It takes ten days to travel back and forth from Lincang to Gengma, and the route is full of high mountains and ridges, and wild animals often appear in the forests. At first, many comrades were unwilling to go, but Feng Tingzhong volunteered to the leadership and said, "Let me go." Since then, he has been responsible for the postal service on this route.

The climate in southern Yunnan is scorching in summer and bitterly cold in winter, and the roads are even more slippery and difficult to walk on rainy days. Feng Tingzhong often had to travel in the dark, sometimes only eating a little cold rice ball to get through the day. If he couldn't reach the station that day, he had to stay in the mountains and fields. These difficulties did not affect his enthusiasm for work.

Once, when crossing a river, the water suddenly rose. Local people in this situation would have to turn back. But Feng Tingzhong thought, "If I turn back, I don't know how long the mail will be delayed, and the people in the border areas are so eager for news from the interior! I must arrive on time." He plucked up his courage and went into the water. Just as he reached the middle of the river, a violent wave hit him far away. He held the mail high with both hands, preventing the river water from wetting it, and struggled back to the shore. The second time, he re-selected a location and ventured across the water to the other side.

In August 1954, the government decided to open a postal route from Gengma to Cangyuan. It was even more difficult to walk this route. The Kawa ethnic group lives along the way, and they do not speak the same language. Feng Tingzhong thought: "Work is a major matter, and difficulties are minor matters. All difficulties can be overcome if we find a way." He happily accepted this new task.

There is a steep and narrow section of road on this route that is often covered with mud and water for two seasons each year. Feng Tingzhong developed sores on his feet from stepping in this mud and water. The leadership wanted him to take a period of rest. He said, "It doesn't matter if my feet hurt a little, but if the mail is delayed, it will affect the work of a county." He endured the pain and continued to travel on business.

In the past three years, Feng Tingzhong has never lost a single piece of mail. Every time he went on a business trip, he carefully checked the mailbags to see if they were tied tightly and whether they would get wet in the rain. At night, he put the mail next to his pillow or under his pillow when he stayed in a store.

When Feng Tingzhong first arrived in the Kawa area, he found it very inconvenient because he didn't speak the language and had problems with food and lodging. In order to have good relations with the local Kawa people, he helped them with their work every time he arrived at a village. Some Kawa elders who understood Dai language, and he used Dai language to chat with them about their daily lives, and he often promoted the Party's ethnic policies to them. Once, after listening to him talk about Chairman Mao's love for the people in the border areas, an old Kawa man said with emotion, "I will work hard to increase production and strive to become a labor model and see Chairman Mao." When Feng Tingzhong came from the city for the second time, he used his own money to buy several portraits of Chairman Mao and gave them to the old man and others. Now Feng Tingzhong is very close to the local Kawa people. (Extracted and adapted from Yunnan Daily)

### 在云南边疆的傣族邮运员俸廷仲

    在云南边疆的傣族邮运员俸廷仲
    在云南西南临沧、耿马、沧源等几个边沿县的山林里，一个年轻的小伙子经常踩着泥泞的道路，带着邮件，艰难地越过一个山头又一个山头。他就是傣族青年邮运员俸廷仲。
    一九五二年十二月，俸廷仲被调到临沧县邮电局工作。
    这一带地方居住着傣、佧瓦、拉祜等民族。重重的高山，阻挡了和内地的交通。一九五三年七月，人民政府决定开辟临沧到耿马的邮路。
    从临沧到耿马来回得走十天，沿途又是高山峻岭，森林里还常常有野兽出没。起初，许多同志都不愿去，俸廷仲就自告奋勇地向领导要求说：“让我去。”从此，他就担任了这条路的邮运工作。
    滇南的气候，夏天酷热，冬天严寒，下雨天路更滑得难走。俸廷仲还常常不得不摸黑赶路，有时只吃一点儿冷饭团就度过一天。当天赶不到站，只好宿在山野里。这些困难，都没有影响他的工作积极性。
    有一次过河时，河水突然涨了，当地老百姓遇到这种情形，就只好折回去。可是俸廷仲想：“要是折回去，邮件不晓得又要积压多久，边疆人民是多么盼望着内地的消息啊！一定要按时到达才行。”他鼓着勇气，就下水去了。刚到河心，一股猛烈的浪头把他打了很远，他双手高举着邮件，不让河水浸湿，又挣扎着回到岸上来。第二次他重新选择了一个地点，冒险涉水走到了对岸。
    一九五四年八月，政府又决定开辟从耿马到沧源的邮路。走这条路困难更多。沿途居住的是佧瓦族，语言不通。俸廷仲想：“工作是大事，困难是小事，一切困难想办法总可以克服。”他又愉快地接受了这个新的任务。
    这条路上有一段又陡又窄的路，每年有两季经常积满泥水。俸廷仲踩了这种泥水，脚上生了疮。领导上要他休养一个时期。他说：“我的脚痛一点不要紧，邮件积压了就要影响一个县的工作。”他忍住痛，还是继续地出差去了。
    近三年来，俸廷仲从没有损失过一次邮件。每次出差的时候，他总是仔细检查邮包，看扎得紧不紧，下雨时会不会浸水，晚上住店就把邮件放在自己枕头旁边或枕头下面。
    俸廷仲初到佧瓦族地区的时候，语言不通，食宿都感到非常不便。为了同当地佧瓦族人民搞好关系，他每到一个寨子就帮他们做活。有些佧瓦族老人懂傣话，他就用傣话同他们谈家常，还经常向他们宣传党的民族政策。有一次，一个佧瓦族老大爷听他讲了毛主席热爱边疆人民的事情后，感动地说：“我要好好搞生产，争取当劳动模范，去见毛主席。”俸廷仲第二次从城里来的时候，就用自己的钱买了几张毛主席像，送给了这个老大爷和别的人。现在俸廷仲和当地佧瓦族人民已处得非常亲密了。　（摘编自云南日报）
