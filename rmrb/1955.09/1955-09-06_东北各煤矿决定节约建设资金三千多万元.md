    Northeast Coal Mines Decide to Save Over 30 Million Yuan in Construction Funds

    (Our Dispatch) The Northeast coal mines have decided to save 36,640,000 yuan in state capital construction investment this year, exceeding the savings target required by the Coal Mine Administration Bureau by 4,224,000 yuan. Among them, the coal mines in Fuxin, Hegang, and Fushun will each save more than 5 million yuan in capital construction investment, and the coal mines in Jixi, Benxi, and other places will also save more than 3 million yuan in capital construction investment.
    After the former Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Coal Mine Administration Bureau issued instructions to practice thrift and oppose waste, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau conveyed and mobilized its subordinate bureaus, mines, and capital construction units. Based on the savings already achieved in the first half of the year and the different situations of each bureau, it formulated this year's savings targets. Of the total savings task this year, 89% is attributed to plan reduction, lowering engineering design standards, and engineering costs, while 11% is attributed to lowering the standards for non-productive buildings. The Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau also requires all capital construction units to ensure speed in industrial construction, absolutely guarantee the quality of all projects, ensure normal construction, and strictly prevent new waste phenomena from occurring. Furthermore, productive construction projects must strive to be advanced, auxiliary projects must be simplified, and non-productive construction projects can only adopt the lowest standards. In addition, the use of steel materials must be strictly controlled. All buildings and facilities, except those that must use steel materials due to technical requirements, must use substitute materials. Currently, all capital construction units under the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau have formulated effective savings measures to ensure the completion of this year's savings task.

    东北各煤矿决定节约建设资金三千多万元
    本报讯　东北各煤矿今年决定为国家节约基本建设投资三千六百六十四万元，超过煤矿管理总局要求的节约指标四百二十二万四千元。其中阜新、鹤岗、抚顺三个煤矿节约的基本建设投资都将在五百万元以上，鸡西、本溪等煤矿节约的基本建设投资也将在三百万元以上。
    在前燃料工业部同煤矿管理总局发出厉行节约反对浪费的指示以后，东北煤矿管理局就对所属各局矿、各基本建设单位作了传达和动员，并根据今年上半年已经完成的节约情况和各局不同的情况制定了今年的节约指标。在今年全部节约任务中，属于计划核减、降低工程设计标准和工程造价的占节约总数的百分之八十九，属于降低非生产性建筑标准的占节约总数的百分之十一。东北煤矿管理局还要求各基本建设单位在工业建筑方面，必须保证速度，对一切工程要绝对保证质量，保证正常施工，严格防止新的浪费现象发生；并要使生产性建筑工程力求先进，附属工程必须从简，非生产性建筑工程只能采用最低标准；这以外，还要严格控制钢铁材料的使用，一切建筑和设施，除技术要求必须使用钢铁材料的以外，一律使用代用材料。现在东北煤矿管理局各基本建设单位已经分别制定出有效的节约措施，保证完成今年的节约任务。
