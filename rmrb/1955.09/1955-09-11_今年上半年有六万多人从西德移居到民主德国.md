    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 9th. The German Unification Issues Committee held a press conference in Berlin on the 7th. Committee Secretary Giernos said at the press conference: The number of people returning or moving from West Germany to the German Democratic Republic is increasing day by day. In 1954, 100,000 people moved from West Germany to the German Democratic Republic, and in the first half of this year, there were 61,000 people, including 15,000 young people, an increase of 22 percent over the same period last year. Among these people are scientists, artists, engineers, and doctors.

    Giernos pointed out: A large number of people moved to the German Democratic Republic because they have long been unemployed and living in poverty in West Germany, or because they cannot tolerate the political persecution by the West German authorities. The majority of young people are against conscription; they oppose the remilitarization of West Germany.

    Approximately fifty young people from West Germany participated in the press conference, and they pointed out the instability of West German society and the hardship of life. They expressed that they saw a bright future of life in the German Democratic Republic. They are determined to become new citizens of the German Democratic Republic.

    今年上半年有六万多人从西德移居到民主德国
    新华社柏林九日电　德国统一问题委员会七日在柏林举行记者招待会。委员会秘书吉尔诺斯在招待会上说：从西德返回或移居到德意志民主共和国的人数一天比一天增加。从西德移居到德意志民主共和国的人在一九五四年有十万人，在今年上半年有六万一千人，其中青年有一万五千人，比去年同期增加了百分之二十二。在这批人中间有科学家、艺术家、工程师和医生等。
    吉尔诺斯指出：大批人民移居德意志民主共和国是因为他们在西德长期失业、生活困苦，或者因为不能忍受西德当局政治上的迫害。青年人中大部分是因为反对征兵，他们反对西德重新军国主义化。
    约有五十个从西德过来的青年参加了记者招待会，他们在会上指出西德社会的不安定和生活的困苦。他们表示，在德意志民主共和国看到了生活的光明远景。他们决心要做德意志民主共和国的新公民。
