Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 12th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on September 1 regarding the joint communique of the Japan-U.S. talks.

The statement pointed out: The Japan-U.S. joint communique issued by Shigemitsu and Dulles shows that, under the pretext of instability in the Far East situation, they want to expand military bases in Japan, strengthen rearmament, and further transform the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" into a more powerful treaty.

This runs counter to the direction of easing international tensions pointed out by the heads of government of the Four Powers, and it also runs counter to the Japanese people's desire for independence and peace, which includes revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" and removing obstacles to Japan-China trade and Japan-Soviet negotiations.

The statement said: The communique states that the Far East situation is unstable, but the cause of the instability, as evidenced by the situations in Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan, lies in the U.S. imperialist plans to invade Asia. The fact that Japan is subordinate to the United States and that Japan is being turned into a base for atomic warfare, with China and the Soviet Union as imagined enemies, is also a major cause of instability in the Asian political situation.

Therefore, in order to consolidate peace in Asia and to realize Japan's independence and prosperity, abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," "Administrative Agreement," and all other unequal treaties that make Japan subordinate to U.S. imperialism's atomic warfare policy, and striving to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other Asian countries is the path that conforms to the interests of the Japanese people.

The statement also pointed out: The Japan-U.S. joint communique shows that the Hatoyama Cabinet has succumbed to U.S. intimidation and pressure, violated its promises to the people, and is attempting to make the Japanese people serve the U.S. atomic warfare policy more effectively. The communique also indicates that, in order to implement this policy, the Hatoyama Cabinet is attempting to revise the constitution and restrict and suppress the Communist Party and the democratic movement.

The statement concluded: The Japanese Communist Party opposes the Hatoyama Cabinet's pro-U.S. policy and will unite with all democratic forces and the people of the whole country to fight for the independence and peace of the motherland.

    日共中央常任干部会就日美会谈发表声明
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会，在九月一日就日美会谈的联合公报发表了声明。
    声明指出：重光和杜勒斯发表的日美联合公报表明，他们借口远东形势不稳定，要扩大在日本的军事基地，加强重整军备，把日美“安全条约”进一步变成强有力的条约。
    这是同四大国政府首脑会议指出的缓和国际紧张局势的方向背道而驰的，也是同日本人民要求改订日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”、消除日中贸易和日苏谈判的障碍等争取独立与和平的愿望相违背的。
    声明说：公报说远东形势不稳定，但是不稳定的原因正如朝鲜、印度支那和台湾的形势所表明的那样，在于美帝国主义侵略亚洲的计划。把日本从属于美国、把日本变成以中苏两国为假想敌国的原子战争基地这个事实也是造成亚洲政治形势不稳定的重大原因。
    因此，为了巩固亚洲和平，为了实现日本的独立和繁荣，废除使日本从属于美帝国主义的原子战争政策的日美“安全条约”、“行政协定”等一切不平等条约，以及为争取同苏联、中国和亚洲其他国家建立正常的外交关系而努力，乃是符合日本人民利益的道路。
    声明还指出：日美联合公报表明，鸠山内阁已经屈服在美国的威吓和压力之下，违背了它对人民所作的诺言，企图使日本人民日益有效地服务于美国的原子战争政策。公报并且表明，鸠山内阁为了执行这种政策，正企图修改宪法，对共产党和民主运动加以限制和镇压。
    声明最后说：日本共产党反对鸠山内阁的这种从属于美国的政策，为了争取祖国的独立与和平，将同一切民主力量和全国人民团结起来进行斗争。
