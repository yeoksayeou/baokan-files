    Newspapers in Various Countries Advocate for the Restoration of China's Legitimate Rights in the United Nations
    According to Xinhua News Agency, at the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 20, the US representative and the mechanical majority it controlled forced the Assembly to adopt the absurd proposal of "not considering the issue of China's representation in the United Nations" at this session, thus once again obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. This action by the US government and its followers has aroused condemnation and protest from newspapers in many countries.
    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an article on the 24th stating that the US representative's act of once again, without reason, refusing to discuss the Soviet proposal on restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China at the United Nations General Assembly is incompatible with the "Geneva spirit" and a trampling on the principles of international law. The Romanian "Munca" wrote on the 22nd that the action taken by the United Nations General Assembly under the influence of the United States is a very unjust action against the Chinese people, and this action, taken out of fear of further relaxation of the international situation, will only hinder the settlement of international disputes. The Czechoslovak "Rude Pravo" published a commentary by a special correspondent on the 24th stating that the People's China being deprived of its legitimate seat in the United Nations is the most obvious illegal act in international relations. People of all countries who demand to maintain and develop the Geneva spirit are calling for further steps to be taken in strengthening international cooperation, and restoring the People's China's legitimate rights in the United Nations is precisely such a concrete step.
    The Indian Urdu daily "Naya Zamana" published an editorial on the 24th stating that this decision by the United Nations General Assembly "will reduce the prestige of the United Nations organization and will undermine efforts to improve the world situation." The editorial said that although the Soviet proposal did not pass under the pressure of the United States, the population of the countries that voted in favor of this proposal, combined with the population of China, exceeds half of the world's population. The editorial said that the United States, faced with ironclad reality, had to agree to hold direct negotiations with the People's Republic of China, but it opposed admitting China into the United Nations organization, just to keep its puppet Chiang Kai-shek alive and usurp China's seat in the Security Council. The Egyptian "Al-Gomhuria" published a commentary on the 24th stating that some countries, especially the United States and Britain, stubbornly opposed the passage of this resolution, "which will aggravate international tensions and hinder the restoration of universal peace." "Al-Ahram" sharply condemned the policies of the United States and Britain towards China and demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.
    Even some newspapers in the United States could not but acknowledge that the United States' forcing the United Nations General Assembly to reject the restoration of the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations was against the will of the majority of member states. "The Washington Post" published an editorial on the 24th stating that "If the government is sensible, it will not regard postponing the vote on the question of Communist China's entry into the United Nations as a reason for inaction or self-congratulation. It is very clear: this vote does not represent the true sentiments of many member states of the United Nations." The London correspondent of "The Scotsman" quoted British diplomatic sources as saying, "One of the biggest deals in the history of the United Nations has been completed in New York." The newspaper said that Britain agreed to support the United States in postponing the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of allowing the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations for another year in exchange for the Americans' support for Britain's refusal to allow Greece to discuss the Cyprus issue at the United Nations General Assembly.

### 各国报纸主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利

    各国报纸主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利
    据新华社讯　在九月二十日联合国大会第十届会议上，由于美国代表及其控制的机械多数，强使大会通过了本届会议“不考虑关于中国在联合国中的代表权的问题”的荒谬提案，因而再一次阻挠了恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。美国政府及其追随者这种行径引起许多国家报纸的斥责和抗议。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”二十四日发表一篇文章说，美国代表在联合国大会上又一次毫无理由地拒绝讨论苏联关于恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利的提案的行为，是同“日内瓦精神”不相容的，也是对国际法原则的蹂躏。罗马尼亚“劳动报”二十二日写道，联合国大会在美国影响下采取的行动是对中国人民极不公正的行动，这种由于害怕国际局势进一步缓和而采取的行动，只会阻碍国际争端的解决。捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”二十四日刊载特派记者的评论说，人民中国被剥夺了它在联合国里的合法席位，是国际关系中最明显的非法行为。要求保持和发展日内瓦精神的各国人民，都呼吁在加强国际合作方面采取进一步的步骤，而恢复人民中国在联合国内的合法权利，正是这种具体的步骤。
    印度乌尔都文日报“新世纪报”二十四日发表社论说，联合国大会这一决定“将降低联合国组织的威信，并且将损害为改善世界局势而作的努力”。社论说，虽然苏联的提案在美国的压力下没有通过，然而投票赞成这一提案的国家的人口同中国的人口合计起来超过世界人口的一半。社论说，美国在面对铁的现实的情况下不得不同意同中华人民共和国举行直接谈判，但是它却反对接纳中国进入联合国组织，这只是为了使它的傀儡蒋介石活命和篡夺中国在安全理事会中的席位。埃及“共和国报”二十四日发表评论说，某些国家，特别是美国和英国，顽固地反对通过这个决议，“结果是加剧国际紧张局势并且妨碍恢复普遍的和平”。“开罗报”尖锐地谴责美国和英国对中国的政策，并且要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    甚至美国的一些报纸也不能不承认美国强迫联合国大会拒绝恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利是违反多数会员国的意志的。“华盛顿邮报”二十四日发表一篇社论说，“如果（美国）政府是明白事理的话，它将不认为推迟考虑共产党中国进入联合国问题的投票可以当作不采取行动或私自庆幸的理由。这是很清楚的：这次投票并不代表联合国很多会员国的真正情绪。”“苏格兰人报”伦敦记者引英国外交界人士的话说，“在纽约完成了联合国历史上最大的交易之一”。这家报纸说，英国同意支持美国把联合国大会讨论允许中华人民共和国进入联合国问题再推迟一年，是以美国人支持英国拒绝希腊要求在联合国大会上讨论塞浦路斯问题作为交换的。
