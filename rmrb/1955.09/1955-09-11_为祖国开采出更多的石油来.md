    Extract More Oil for the Motherland
    To the Editor:
    We work in the water and gas injection teams of the Yumen Mining Bureau's Oil Production Plant. This is a job of great importance to the completion of the country's oil extraction tasks. The Laojunmiao Oilfield is currently our country's largest natural oil field. In the past, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' indiscriminate drilling and extraction, this richly endowed oil field suffered great damage. Many oil wells lost their self-flowing capacity, and countless barrels of crude oil were buried underground and could not be extracted. After liberation, with the help of Soviet experts, we adopted the extraction method of "water injection at the edge of the oil field and gas injection at the top of the structure" to maintain and increase the pressure of the oil layer, extend the oil field's production life, and increase crude oil production and the oil layer's recovery rate.
    Water and gas injection work requires advanced equipment and a high level of technical skill. There are many difficulties in the work. But we know that injecting one more drop of water or one more bit of gas means extracting one more drop of oil. We work hard to learn technology, do our jobs well, and complete the tasks assigned to us by the state.
    Gas injection work is carried out under high pressure. Natural gas is very flammable and explosive, and a serious accident can occur with just a moment's carelessness. Initially, because we were not familiar with the machinery performance of the gas injection wells and did not grasp the properties of the gas, everyone was very nervous when working, resulting in chaotic work order, long downtime, and low gas injection volume. Some wells were even shut down for several months. In order to change this situation, we familiarized ourselves with the properties of natural gas through various experiments, mastered the performance of the machinery, and, with the help of technicians, studied operating methods, formulated various operating procedures, and established shift handover and other systems. We also improved the production equipment. In our work, we conscientiously maintain and service the machinery. Drivers never leave the engine room and carefully check the operation of the machinery. As a result, our gas injection team has never had an accident. In the first half of this year, we not only overfulfilled the gas injection task, but also increased the machinery's operating rate by more than double the original plan. The natural gas we use is wet gas, which easily freezes and blocks wells and pipelines in winter, preventing normal gas injection. To overcome this difficulty, in addition to insulating the gas injection pipelines and regularly performing well cleaning and washing, we also took measures to separate the heavier hydrocarbons in the natural gas into liquid form and use absorbers to absorb the water vapor before compressing and injecting it into the wells. In this way, we were able to continuously inject gas even in winter. Many of us have put forward valuable rationalization proposals in our work. For example, Chen Zenrong, the captain of the gas injection team, proposed increasing the starting speed to 285 degrees per minute. Adopting this suggestion not only ensured production safety, but also increased the gas injection volume by two-thirds.
    While carrying out gas injection work, we are also intensively carrying out water injection work at the edge of the oil field. The technical conditions for water injection work are equally complex. Each well must undergo pumping, well washing, water injection testing, acid treatment, acid washing, acid soaking, and other work. In the past, it took us five or six hours to mix acid once, but now we can mix it in two hours. Because we have promoted advanced experience, pumping efficiency has more than doubled. Walking in the mining area of the Yumen Oil Mine, on the hills of the Qilian Mountains, towering derricks can be seen everywhere. Here, thousands of tons of water are being injected into the oil fields.
    We guarantee that we will continue to do our job well in the future, so that the motherland can extract more oil to supply the needs of the country's socialist construction.

### 为祖国开采出更多的石油来

    为祖国开采出更多的石油来编辑同志：
    我们在玉门矿务局采油厂担任着油田注水、注气的工作——这是一项对完成国家石油开采任务有着重要作用的工作。老君庙油田是目前我国最大的天然石油田。过去由于国民党反动派乱打井、乱采油，这个蕴藏丰富的油田遭到了很大的破坏，许多油井失去了自喷能力，无数的原油被埋在地下不能开采出来。解放后，在苏联专家的帮助下，我们采取了“油田边缘注水，构造顶部注气”的开采方法，来保持和提高油层的压力，延长油田的喷油寿命，提高原油产量和油层的采收率。
    注水、注气工作，需要先进的设备和高度的技术水平。工作中的困难是很多的。但是我们知道多注一滴水、多注一点气，就能多开采出一滴石油来，我们努力学习技术，做好工作，完成了国家交给我们的任务。
    注气工作是在高压情况下进行的，天然气非常容易燃烧和爆炸，一不小心就会发生严重的事故。最初，由于我们对注气井的机器性能摸不清，对气体的性质也掌握不住，大家工作时精神非常紧张，因而工作秩序混乱，停工时间很长，注气量很少，有的井甚至一停工就是几个月。为了改变这种情况，我们从各种试验中熟悉了天然气的性质，掌握了机器性能，并且在技术人员的帮助下研究了操作方法，制定了各种操作规程，建立交接班等制度，还改进了生产设备。在工作中，我们认真地做好机器的检修保养工作，司机一刻也不离开机房，细心检查机器的运转情况；因此，我们注气队从来没有发生过事故，今年上半年我们不仅超额完成了注气任务，而且使机器的运转率超过了原计划一倍以上。我们所用的天然气是湿气，在冬天很容易冻结而堵塞井和管线，使注气工作不能正常进行。为了克服这个困难，我们除了做好注气管线的保温工作和经常进行通井、洗井工作以外，并且采取措施，把天然气中较重的碳水化合物变为液体分离出来，利用吸附器把水蒸气吸收后再去压缩注入井中。这样，就顺利地做到了冬天也可以连续注气。我们有许多人在工作中提出了不少宝贵的合理化建议。如注气队队长陈增荣提出把开车速度提高到每分钟二百八十五度的建议，采用这一建议以后，不仅做到生产安全，而且使注气量提高了三分之二。
    在进行注气工作的同时，我们还在紧张地进行油田边缘注水工作。注水工作的技术条件同样是十分复杂的，在每口井内都要进行抽吸、洗井、试注水、酸处理、酸洗、酸浸等工作。过去，我们配酸一次需要五、六个小时，现在两个小时就能配好。因为我们推广了先进经验，抽吸效率提高了一倍多。走在玉门油矿的矿区内，在祁连山的山岗上，到处都可以看见高耸的井架，这里正在把成千成万吨的水注入油田中去。
    我们保证今后还要进一步做好工作，使祖国开采出更多的石油来，供给国家社会主义建设的需要。
