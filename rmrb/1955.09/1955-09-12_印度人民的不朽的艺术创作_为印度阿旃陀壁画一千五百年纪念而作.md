The Immortal Artistic Creation of the Indian People
    ——Written for the 1,500th Anniversary of the Ajanta Murals of India
    Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China
    During our visit to India, we often unexpectedly encountered grand welcoming scenes. Before the train had even come to a stop, the shouts of "Long live the Chinese Cultural Delegation!" echoed back and forth. Endless streams of people, waving welcoming flags, ran alongside the train. Among these crowded people, we often encountered the particularly bright eyes of many women. Those pairs of large eyes occupied the most prominent and broadest position on their faces, particularly round and large in the middle, gradually tapering towards the ends. These are what world artists call the famous "almond" eyes, filled with unspoken, warm, and sincere friendship. Such "almond" eyes, we often encountered in the world-famous Ajanta cave murals and many Indian paintings. Although time separates us by more than 1,500 years (the earliest Ajanta murals are at least 2,100 years old), these "almond" eyes, filled with friendship, still vividly remain on the paintings, eternally existing, as if speaking to us, as if smiling at us, as if innocently and passionately telling us about the suffering and joy of their era. We see the "Procession of the King, Queen, and Entourage" in the earliest mural in Ajanta Cave No. 10. In that painting, the "almond" eyes of the female attendants seem to be smiling innocently as they gaze at us. We see a girl in the Cave No. 2 mural, leaning against a stone pillar, one leg bent, the sole of her foot against the pillar, holding a flower in her hand, petals falling to the ground, her eyes thoughtfully looking down. We see the queen dressing in front of a mirror and the maids on both sides in Cave No. 17, again expressing such drowsy and flowing "almond" eyes, as if inviting us to breathe in the fresh air of the morning together. This is the glorious artistic achievement of ancient India, and also the eternal and immortal creation of the Indian people.

    The great and immortal achievement of the Ajanta murals is, of course, not limited to the expression of the famous "almond" eyed women. More importantly, they depict the various situations and lives of Indian society and the Indian people from the 2nd century BC to the 7th century AD, for nearly a thousand years. Their depiction is so concrete, so vivid and lively, so colorful and vibrant, that they can be regarded as the best historical records left by the Indian artists of that era. Therefore, they are the immortal creation of the Indian people, and a magnificent artistic contribution to all mankind. Although Buddhism had declined in India by the end of the 7th century AD, and gradually tended to disappear, and Buddhists have not existed in the Indian mainland for thousands of years, the Buddhist art of Ajanta is eternally new. They do not decline with the decline of Buddhism in the Indian mainland. The works painted for the needs of Buddhist monasteries and hermitages at that time have now become part of the eternal memorial monuments of human artistic creation. Just like the classical works of Greece and Rome, although the ancient Greek polytheism centered on the worship of Cupid (or Zeus) has long ceased to exist, they have become the most brilliant and moving eternal and immortal works of art that mankind can create.

    In the murals of the first cave of Ajanta, the first thing that amazes people is the statue of Prince Gautama, which is larger than a real person. He is in full dress, holding a blue lotus flower in his hand, his eyes fixed on the front, as if he is looking at the audience watching him from any direction. Some say that this painting depicts Gautama's wedding scene, while others call it "Bodhisattva with Lotus Hand." In any case, there is no doubt that it is a flawless masterpiece.

    There is also a picture of Prince Gautama bathing in the palace. Attendants hold water jugs in both hands, pouring water on his head like pouring nectar. He sits on a peacock throne, with joy on his face, his hair wet and draped down. Other attendants are busy delivering water, bath spices in copper basins, and other things.

    There is a scene of the palace, the king and queen are sitting and chatting, surrounded by nearly ten palace maids, each with different postures and expressions; their skin is so round and soft; their expressions are so charming, and so full of personality.

    On that ceiling, for every flower, fruit, bird, and even figure in each grid, the painters used their ingenuity and skill, creating superior realistic works, without a trace of exaggeration, nor a trace of absurdity. If a grid is taken out separately, it can also become a very perfect and exquisite small painting.

    The murals in the second cave are very well preserved, and are as highly valued as the first cave, and the murals on the ceiling are also the most complete. The posture of the apsaras is elegant and graceful. The famous picture of the king's tour and the three-masted ship sailing in the river (Buddha is on the shore, and a long-haired man is kneeling in the boat praying) are complex in structure and vividly depicted. A king once ordered a beautiful palace maid to seduce the Buddha, but she failed. A mural shows her trembling and prostrate before the enraged king who has drawn his sword, and many palace maids are panicked and surrounding them. There is also a picture of an envoy telling a king some bad news with sorrow and hopelessness. The envoy stretched out a palm, frowning tightly; we see his eyes so melancholy! It fully explains what a frightening story he wants to tell.

    Both the ninth and tenth caves have murals, and they are all the earliest works (around the 2nd century BC). The story of the six-tusked elephant in the tenth cave is very important. These paintings are like comic strips, with several murals forming a complete picture to narrate a story of "Buddha's previous life". The actions of the elephants are masterpieces of sketching. The hunters are so alert and brave, they look like the Indian people commonly seen today, although the weapons used are different. The palace maids and attendants are also like ordinary Indian people who can be encountered everywhere today. The ancient Indian artists wrote them into these pictures and made them immortal.

    The murals in the sixteenth and seventeenth caves are from about the fourth or fifth century AD, so they are later than those in the ninth and tenth caves, but earlier than those in the first and second caves. Even today, if we come from the river, we can see a corner of the golden and magnificent murals in these two caves from afar.

    The murals in the sixteenth cave, such as "The Sorrow of Gautama's Wife When He Became a Monk" (another legend: "The Dying Princess"), are great works in the history of world painting. She sits with her head down as if in a coma, a palace maid is fanning her, and the men and women, old and young, around her are so busy and everyone is sad. There is also a picture: the Buddha is preaching in a hermitage, and kings and wealthy merchants are kneeling and paying their respects to him. There is also a picture: kings riding on a group of elephants, on a tour, attendants holding drums and other musical instruments, soldiers holding long scimitars, and escorting them forward. There is also a picture: the Buddha is sitting on a diamond seat, and a large group of kings and other people are listening to him preach. There are also stories about Buddha's birth, Buddha learning martial arts, and other "Buddha's biography". The characters in these pictures are lifelike. If we are familiar with the Indian people of today, we will definitely be familiar with them. Just below this sixteenth cave, there is a stone step that leads to the riverside, which must have been the gate of the Ajanta Grottoes in ancient times. Two stone elephants stand on both sides of the stone steps, and a stone statue of the Dragon King guards the gate. When Xuanzang came to the Ajanta Grottoes in 638 AD, he walked up from this stone step.

    The murals in the seventeenth cave are particularly rich. In addition to the Thousand Buddhas and the Cycle of Rebirth, almost all of them are full of human touch. Just below a row of eight Buddha statues, there are eight small murals, each depicting a pair of lovers, giving each other flowers or wine, which are true depictions of real life. Several groups of "Apsaras" fly across the sky at night, with thick white clouds behind them. The figures of those "Apsaras" are simply extremely soft and beautiful, and the expressions on their faces are both pure and sweet. An Apsara wearing a flower hat askew, those eyes, that cherry-like small mouth, that pair of long, thin eyebrows that can speak, constitute such a lovely girl. The story of Sakyamuni subduing the mad elephant in the "Buddha's Biography" can vividly describe the emotions of the terrified people. There is a very beautiful and magnificent picture, the story is: Sakyamuni returns after attaining enlightenment and accepts the alms of his wife and son. A princess and a little prince stretched out their hands clasped together in front of Sakyamuni. Sakyamuni's body is particularly solemn and huge, behind him is the blue night sky, and his feet are stepping on white lotus flowers. In the sky, an Apsara holding a garland flies over his head, and flowers fall from the sky. We see how his wife and little prince are looking up at him, and how they are clasping their hands to pay their respects to him. This is one of the best successful works of Indian art. There are also large hunting pictures, and many other stories on "Buddha's previous life" are depicted extremely vividly. For example, in the picture of Prince Vasvantara's travel, the surrounding characters are so realistically represented in the picture, and the images of the merchants doing business in the small shops are simply vividly written out. There is also a picture of Sakyamuni preaching, those crowds who are listening attentively, from the kings to the common people, are so uniformly pious, and so differently expressing their joy. After reading the examples cited above, we can know that the murals of the Ajanta Grottoes in India are the results of the hard work of ancient Indian artists in this cave from the 2nd century BC to the 6th and 7th centuries AD. Using very simple tools and natural pigments, they displayed their unparalleled talents and left behind so many rich and colorful murals, from men, women, and children to birds, horses, elephants, hunting dogs, lions, deer, from the scenery of nature, the sky, clouds to fragrant flowers, green leaves, etc., all are expressed vividly, truthfully, and vividly, not only recording the social life at that time for nearly a thousand years, but also making them immortal. The artists of Ajanta have infinite joy and love for life and nature. They rejoice in the beauty of images and actions, rejoice in and love men, women, children and animals, rejoice in the fresh green of the leaves, rejoice in the vastness of the earth, and rejoice in the brightness of the sun. All of this moved and excited the artists, and they wrote it down. And these painted records have conveyed their joy to many people in the past one or two thousand years. This is one of the meanings of our commemoration of the Ajanta murals. Like the Indian people, we love those immortal creations of the Indian people, the brilliant artistic achievements of India—the Ajanta murals. We, together with the people of the world, celebrate the 1,500th anniversary of the Indian Ajanta murals—they are not only the pride of the Indian people, but also the magnificent and immortal achievements in human art that the entire mankind is proud of.

    印度人民的不朽的艺术创作
    ——为印度阿旃陀壁画一千五百年纪念而作
    中华人民共和国文化部副部长　郑振铎
    我们在印度访问的时候，经常地在不意中遇到盛大的欢迎场面。火车还不曾停下来，“中国文化代表团‘荆特巴’（万岁）”的呼声就此呼彼应地继续地高喊着。无穷尽的人流，举着欢迎的旗帜，随着火车跑。在这些拥挤的人群里，我们经常地碰到许多特别光亮的妇女们的大眼睛。那一对对的大眼睛，占着脸部的最明显而且是最广阔的地位，中间特别圆大，而两头则逐渐尖小下去。这些就是世界艺术家们所谓有名的“杏仁”眼，充溢着无言的热烈而真挚的友情的眼睛。像这样的“杏仁”眼，我们在著名世界的阿旃陀石窟的壁画上和好些印度绘画上也经常地遇到。时间相隔着一千五百年以上了（最早期的阿旃陀壁画离今至少在二千一百年以上），这样的充溢着友情的“杏仁”眼，还活生生地留在画面上，永恒的存在着，像对我们说着话，像对我们微笑着，像天真而热情地在倾诉着她们那时代的苦难和欢乐。我们看阿旃陀石窟最早期的第十窟壁画中的“国王、王妃和随从的行列”，在那一幅画里，那些侍从的妇女们的“杏仁”眼是那么天真地含着微笑似地在对我们睁望着。我们看第二窟壁画里的一位女郎，身倚石柱，屈起一腿，足底板抵在柱上，手里执着一朵花，花瓣儿纷纷落在地上，她的双眼若有所思地下注着。我们看第十七窟的那位对镜梳妆的王后和两旁的侍女们，又是表现着那么惺忪而流转的“杏仁”眼，仿佛叫我们也同在吸着清晨的新鲜空气。这是古代印度的辉煌的艺术成就，也是印度人民的永恒的不朽的创作。
    阿旃陀壁画的伟大的不朽的成就，当然不限于表现有名的“杏仁”眼的妇女们，更重要的是，它们表现了印度社会和印度人民在从公元前二世纪到公元七世纪的将近一千年间的各式各样的情况和生活；它们的表现是那么具体，那么生动活泼，那么有声有色，可算得是印度那时代的艺术家们笔下所留存的最好的历史记录，也便是印度人民的不朽的创作，为整个人类所作出的宏伟的艺术上的贡献。虽然佛教在公元第七世纪之末在印度已经衰微下来，而且逐渐的趋于消灭了，佛教徒已经有千把年在印度本土上不存在了，但阿旃陀的佛教艺术却是万古常新。它们并不随着印度本土的佛教的衰亡而衰亡。当时为佛教的寺院和精舍的需要而绘画的作品，如今却成为人类艺术创作上永恒纪念的丰碑之一部分。正像希腊罗马的古典作品一样，虽然以邱比德（或宙士）的崇拜为中心的希腊古代的多神教早已不存在，但它们，却成为人类所能创作的最辉煌最动人的永恒不朽的艺术品了。
    在阿旃陀石窟的第一窟壁画里，首先令人惊叹的是那个比真人的身体还高大些的乔答摩太子像，他盛装着，手执一朵青色的莲花，双眼注视着前面，仿佛正在注视着从任何方向对他看着的观众。有人说，这画表现乔答摩结婚时的情形，也有人称之为“莲花手菩萨”。不管如何，无可怀疑的，那是一幅完美无疵的杰作。
    还有一幅是乔答摩太子在宫中沐浴图。侍从们双手执着水罐，醍醐灌顶地向他头上倒下水去。他坐在孔雀宝座上，脸上带着愉悦，他的头发湿湿地披了下来。还有别的侍从们在忙着送水、送盛在铜盆里的沐浴用的香料和别的东西。
    有一幅宫廷的景色，国王和王后坐着闲谈，左右有近十个宫女围绕着，各有不同的姿态和表情；她们的肌肤是那么圆润，又是那么柔和；她们的神态是那么妩媚，又是那么具有个性。
    就在那天花板上，每一格的花、果、禽鸟、以至人物，画家们也都运以精心，出之巧密，是现实主义的上乘的作品，不带一点浮夸，也没有一点荒诞的成分。如果单独截取了一格，也可自成一幅很完美、很精致的小画幅。
    第二窟的壁画保存得还很好，和第一窟同是最受人重视的，天花板上的壁画也最为完整。飞天的姿态是飘举而优美的。有名的国王出巡图和三桅船在河中驶行图（佛在岸上，船中有一长发的人跪着祈祷），结构复杂而描写得很生动。一个国王曾命令他的一个美丽的宫女去诱惑佛，但她失败了。一幅壁画表现她战栗地匍伏在盛怒地拔出刀来的国王之前，许多宫女们都惊惶失措地围绕着他们。还有一幅是表现一个使臣在一个国王面前，忧愁而无望地告诉他某些坏消息。那个使臣伸出一只手掌，紧蹙着双眉；我们看他那双眼睛那么愁郁！完全说明了他所要诉说的是什么一件值得惊惶的故事。
    第九窟和第十窟都有壁画，而且都是最早期的作品（约在公元前二世纪）。第十窟里所有的六牙象的故事画是十分重要的。这些画幅成为连环图画似的，以若干幅的壁画构成一个完整的画面，来叙说一个“佛本生经”的故事。那象群的行动是写生的杰作。猎人们是那么机警而勇敢，看来宛如今日所常见的印度人民，虽然所用的武器是不同了。那宫女们、侍从们也都好似活在今日的处处可以遇到的印度的平平常常的老百姓。而古老的印度艺术家们把他（她）们写入这些画面上而使之永生不朽了。
    第十六窟和第十七窟的壁画，时代约在公元第四或第五世纪，因之，较之第九、第十窟的为晚，但比之第一、第二窟的却较早。直到今天，我们如果从河道上来的话，老远的就会望得见这两窟之内金碧辉煌的壁画的一角。
    第十六窟的壁画，像“乔答摩出家修道时他妻子的悲哀”（另一传说：“垂死的公主”），是世界画史上的大作品。她昏迷似的低头坐着，一个宫女在打扇，周围的男男女女，老老少少，是多末忙碌，而且个个人都悲愁着。还有一幅：佛在一个精舍里说法，国王们、富商们跪着向他敬礼。还有一幅：国王们骑在一群象上，在出巡，侍从们执着鼓和其他乐器，兵士们执着长的弯刀，拥着他们往前走。还有一幅：佛坐在金刚座上，一大群的国王们和别的人们在围着听他说法。还有佛诞生、佛学武艺等等的“佛传”上的故事画。这些画面上的人物都是栩栩如生的。我们如果熟悉今日的印度人民，也一定会熟悉他们。就在这第十六窟之下，有一道石级，可走到河道边上，古时一定是阿旃陀石窟的山门。有两只石象，站在石级的两旁，有一尊石雕的龙王像在守卫着这山门。玄奘法师在公元六三八年到阿旃陀石窟来时，就由这道石级走上来的。
    第十七窟的壁画尤为丰富。除了千佛像和轮回图之外，差不多都是极富于人情味的。就在一横列的八尊佛像之下，有八小格的小幅壁画，每一幅都表现着一对情人，彼此在赠花或送酒，是人间的现实生活的写真。有好几群“飞天”在夜里飞过天空，浓厚的白云在他们后面。那些“飞天”的身姿简直是柔美极了，脸部的表情是既纯洁，又甜蜜。一位斜戴着一顶花帽的飞天，那双眼睛，那个樱桃似的小嘴，那对会说话的长长细细的眉毛，构成了多末可爱的一位女郎。“佛传”中的释迦制伏狂象的故事，是能够把惊恐的人民的情绪描写得淋漓尽致的。有一幅十分美丽而宏伟的大画面，故事是：释迦成道归来，接受他妻和子的布施。一位公主和一位小王子在释迦面前伸出合掌的手来。释迦的身体特别庄严巨大，背后是蓝色的夜天，他的双足踏在白色的莲花上。在天空，一位飞天执着花环飞在他的头顶上，花朵纷纷的从天上落下。我们看，他的妻和小王子是怎样的抬头望着他，又是怎样的向他合掌致礼。这是印度艺术的最好的成功作品之一。还有大幅的狩猎图，以及其他“佛本生经”上的好些故事都被描绘得生动之至。譬如像华斯梵他罗太子的出行图，那周围的人物是多末现实地被表现在画面上，那些在小商店里做着买卖的商人们的形象，简直是活灵活现的被写了出来。还有一幅释迦说法图，那些聚精会神地在静听着的群众，从国王们到老百姓们是那么同一的虔诚，又是那么不同的各各表露出喜悦之意。我们读了上面所举的例子，就可以知道，印度阿旃陀石窟的壁画乃是古代的印度艺术家们，从公元前二世纪到公元第六、七世纪，一直在这个石窟里辛勤工作的成果。用很简单的工具和天然的颜料，施展出他们无比的才能，留下了那么许多丰富多采的壁画，从男人、女人、孩子到禽鸟、马匹、象群、猎狗、狮子、鹿，从自然界的景色，天空、云彩到芬香的花朵，绿色的树叶等等，无不表现得活泼、真实和生动，不仅记录下将近千年间的当时社会生活，而且是，使它们永生了。阿旃陀的艺术家们对于人生和自然是有无穷的喜悦和爱情的。他们喜悦形象和动作的美，喜悦并爱好男人、女人、孩子和动物，喜悦树叶的新妍的绿色，喜悦大地的广阔，喜悦阳光的明亮。所有这一切，使艺术家们感动、兴奋而动笔记录了下来。而这些绘画的记录又把他们的喜悦传达给一、二千年以来的许多人了。这便是我们纪念阿旃陀壁画的意义之一。我们同印度人民一样，喜爱那些不朽的印度人民的创作，辉煌的印度艺术成就——阿旃陀壁画。我们和全世界人民在一起，庆祝这个印度阿旃陀壁画的一千五百年的纪念——它们不仅是印度人民引为骄傲的，同时也是整个人类引为骄傲的人类艺术上的宏伟不朽的成就。
