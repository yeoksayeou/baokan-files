    Shenyang Bicycle Factory Improves Product Quality
    The state-owned Shenyang Bicycle Factory has improved the quality of its "White Mountain" brand bicycles. In the past, the "White Mountain" brand bicycles produced by this factory had problems such as rusting of electroplating, peeling of paint, and cracks in welding, which caused dissatisfaction and criticism from users. Since March of this year, the factory has been paying attention to improving quality. Workers have implemented twenty suggestions from Soviet experts in the electroplating formula. The improved electroplating has enhanced rust resistance. The electroplated rims and handlebars are bright and dazzling. When tested with salt water spray, they remain in their original condition after continuous spraying for forty-eight hours (previously, it could not reach fourteen hours).

    In the paint work, the composition of the paint has been improved, and phosphating treatment has been added. The paint on the new products does not peel off and is beautiful with luster. In addition, the transmission parts of the newly produced "White Mountain" brand bicycles have an additional grinding process after quenching to ensure the precision and flexibility of the products. In welding operations, specialized personnel are assigned to specialized welding tasks to ensure the quality of welding.

    The "White Mountain" brand bicycles produced by the factory in July have been shipped according to the new standards. Commercial departments in various places have expressed satisfaction with the factory's recent products and have requested to take delivery. (Han Jiatai)

    沈阳自行车厂提高产品质量
    国营沈阳自行车厂提高了“白山”牌自行车的质量。过去这个厂出产的“白山”牌自行车有电镀生锈、烤漆掉皮、烧焊裂口等毛病，引起用户的不满和批评。这个厂从今年三月起注意改进质量，工人们在电镀配方上贯彻了苏联专家二十项建议，改善后的电镀部分增强了防锈能力，镀出的车圈和车把光亮耀眼，用食盐水作喷雾试验时，连续喷射四十八小时，仍保持原状（过去达不到十四小时）。
    在烤漆工作上，改进了配漆的成份，增加了磷化处理，新产品上的烤漆既不脱落而且光泽美观。另外，新产的“白山”牌自行车的传动部件在淬火之后，增加了一道研磨工序，保证了产品的精密灵活性。在焊接操作上实行了专人专活焊接，保证了焊接的质量。
    七月份这个厂出产的“白山”牌自行车，已按新标准出厂。各地商业部门对这个厂最近产品表示满意，纷纷要求提货。　（韩家泰）
