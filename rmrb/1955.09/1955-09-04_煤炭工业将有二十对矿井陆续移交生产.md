The state-owned coal industry will successively transfer twenty pairs of newly built, renovated, and restored mines to production from September to the end of this year. Adding the twenty-nine pairs of mines that have already been put into production in the past two years, the newly added production capacity of the state-owned coal industry in the first three years of the first Five-Year Plan will be equivalent to more than 30% of the original production capacity in 1952.

Most of the mines planned to be transferred to production before the end of the year have now entered the final stages of construction. Among them, the newly built Dongshan Shaft of Hegang Mining Bureau, which is of large scale, has completed most of the project construction and started trial production on July 16. The newly built Central Shaft of Liaoyuan Xi'an Mining Bureau has also completed 90% of the entire mine construction project. These two pairs of mines are the first two pairs built with comprehensive Soviet assistance to China out of more than ten large shafts after the Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine. These two pairs of shafts are equipped with the latest Soviet technology, with highly mechanized and automated coal mining and transportation equipment, and also have very large output.

In order to rapidly supply the needs of industrial coal during the first Five-Year Plan period, the coal industry system has implemented the policy of "less investment and faster coal production" in recent years. Among the mines to be transferred to production this year, more than twenty pairs are restored and renovated old mines. These mines have only undergone one or two years of construction, and the increased coal production each year is enough to supply the annual power generation needs of more than one million kilowatts of thermal power equipment. The Dongda Well of Fengfeng Coal Mine, which officially started producing coal in early August this year, has resumed production in only one year and seven months from the start of construction in January last year, and the state's investment in it is only equivalent to one-half of the cost of building a new mine of the same scale. Three pairs of renovated small mines of Hegang Mining Bureau will be put into production before the end of this year. These three pairs of mines have only carried out some basic construction to change the mining methods, and can increase the production of hundreds of thousands of tons of raw coal next year.

### 煤炭工业将有二十对矿井陆续移交生产

    煤炭工业将有二十对矿井陆续移交生产
    从九月起到今年年底止，国营煤炭工业将有二十对新建、改建和恢复的矿井陆续移交生产。加上过去两年多内已经投入生产的二十九对矿井，在第一个五年计划头三年中，国营煤炭工业新增加的生产能力，将等于一九五二年原有生产能力的百分之三十以上。
    计划在年底前移交生产的矿井，目前大部分已进入施工结尾阶段。其中规模宏大的鹤岗矿务局新建的东山竖井，绝大部分工程已经建设完成，并已在七月十六日开始试生产。辽源西安矿务局新建的中央竖井也已完成了全部建井工程的百分之九十。这两对矿井是继阜新海州露天矿之后由苏联全面援助我国建设的十多对大竖井中最先建成的两对。这两对竖井都是用苏联最新的技术装备起来的，不但有高度机械化和自动化的采煤和运输设备，而且产量也很大。
    为了迅速供应第一个五年计划期间工业用煤的需要，几年来煤炭工业系统贯彻了“投资少、出煤快”的方针。在今年移交生产的矿井中，有二十多对是恢复和改建的旧矿井。这些矿井都只经过一两年的建设，每年增产的煤炭就足够供应一百多万瓩火力发电设备全年发电的需要。已在今年八月初开始正式出煤的峰峰煤矿东大井，从去年一月开始施工到现在，只一年零七个月的时间就恢复了生产，而国家对它的投资只相当于新建一个同样规模矿井的二分之一。鹤岗矿务局今年年底前有三对改建的小矿井将投入生产，这三对矿井都只是为改变开采方法而进行了一些基本建设，明年就能增产几十万吨原煤。　（新华社）
