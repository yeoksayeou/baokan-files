Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 10th: The following is the full text of Bulganin's speech on September 10, 1955:

    Yesterday we listened to the speech by Federal Republic Chancellor Adenauer, which was indeed very interesting and worthy of serious consideration. Mr. Adenauer spoke of the enormous importance of the current talks and the difficulties involved. We are also fully aware of this.

    Mr. Adenauer said that he wished to conduct these talks with complete frankness. We are also willing to say the same.

    One cannot but agree with what was said yesterday about the danger of a new war threatening Europe.

    The Soviet people know very well what war means in our time. They experienced it firsthand not long ago, even though they had not threatened anyone, nor did they intend to invade foreign territories, and were willing to live peacefully with all countries. During the four years of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people encountered such great disasters and suffered so much at the hands of the aggressors and war criminals that even now, not a single Soviet family can recall this event without feeling great pain and a heartfelt protest.

    The war brought severe losses and destruction to the peoples of Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, as well as to the peoples of France and Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The people of all Europe cannot forget and will not forget the crimes of German militarism and fascism, which launched the Second World War.

    The German people are in a different situation. But for them, the war ultimately brought only great losses and misfortune. It should be believed that the German people now hate war no less than the Soviet people. When speaking of the Soviet and German peoples, we can say with complete certainty that their dreams and sentiments in this regard clearly have much in common. In any case, we believe that they do not want a new war to break out, and we believe that they should unite more closely to ensure peace and security, which is in the wishes and interests of all European peoples—and not just European peoples.

    We have assured frankness, so we must tell you, the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, that after the war, the Soviet Union has already established harmonious and friendly relations with a part of the German people. These relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have developed on a solid foundation of multifaceted cooperation. We have no doubt that the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are in the interests of the Soviet and German peoples. This relationship will continue to develop on the basis of equality and non-interference in internal affairs.

    The Soviet Union hopes to establish normal relations with the Federal Republic of Germany as well. We believe that, under the current circumstances, there can be no serious reasons—no matter how cleverly conceived—for delaying the normalization of these relations.

    Such a delay is in the interests of neither the Soviet people nor the German people. All those who strive for peace and consolidate peace, and who truly remember the losses and disasters brought by war, will agree that relations between our two countries must be normalized.

    In West Germany, sometimes people say that one should deal with the Soviet Union "from a position of strength." We cannot but scoff at this statement when we mention it. One cannot help but laugh at this argument. The German Wehrmacht, Germany, the German people know better than anyone else how the Soviet Union was and how it is now.

    What is the meaning of these talks in West Germany about a policy of "from a position of strength?" Obviously, all this talk must be from those who have even forgotten the lessons of the Second World War. It seems to me that both sides participating in the current talks can agree that if any of us were now pursuing a similar approach, the talks that have begun in Moscow would be meaningless.

    Mr. Adenauer said that the Federal Republic of Germany does not pose any "preconditions" for the normalization of relations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet delegation welcomes Mr. Adenauer's remarks. Posing "preconditions" would violate the spirit of the document exchange before the start of this meeting; doing so would not be in the interests of the Soviet and German peoples.

    As for the two issues specifically mentioned in the Federal Chancellor's speech, the Soviet government needs to express its opinion on each issue separately.

    The Issue of Prisoners of War

    The Federal Chancellor raised the issue of prisoners of war as the main issue. We believe that there is some misunderstanding here. There are no German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union. All German prisoners of war have been released and repatriated. Only war criminals of the former Hitler army are in the Soviet Union, criminals who were convicted by Soviet courts for committing particularly heinous crimes against the Soviet people, against peace, and against humanity. Indeed, as of September 1, there were still 9,626 such people in our country. But these people must be treated as criminals according to the most humane standards and rules. These are people who have lost their humanity, these are saboteurs, arsonists, and murderers who killed the old, the weak, women, and children. The Soviet courts have given them their due punishment and they cannot be regarded as prisoners of war.

    The Soviet people cannot forget the serious crimes of these criminals, such as the massacre of 70,000 people in Babi Yar in Kyiv. We cannot forget the millions of people who were shot, hanged, or burned alive in German concentration camps. Indeed, how can people forget the tons of women's hair that were cut from the heads of tortured women and stored in Majdanek? We here have personally witnessed what happened in Majdanek. More than five and a half million completely innocent people were killed in the Majdanek and Auschwitz concentration camps. The Ukrainian people will never forget the tens of thousands of innocent men and women who were shot or hanged in Kharkiv.

    I might mention the concentration camps set up in Smolensk, Krasnodar, Stavropol, Lviv, Poltava, Novgorod, Orel, Rivne, Kaunas, Riga, and many other cities, where the Nazis murdered hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens. People cannot forget those innocent people who were murdered, hanged, or buried alive, people cannot forget those burned cities and villages, and the women, teenagers and children who were killed. The 9,626 people I mentioned are the criminals who committed these heinous crimes.

    I would also like to further point out that if we are to discuss the issue of these criminals at this time and place, it is necessary for representatives of both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to participate in the discussion. But this is an issue that concerns both parts of Germany. We believe that the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany would find it inappropriate under the current circumstances for the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to jointly participate in the discussion of this issue, so it is clearly inappropriate to treat this issue as a topic in the current negotiations.

    The Issue of Reunifying Germany

    We completely agree that the issue of reunifying Germany is an important national task for the German people. The Soviet government has always consistently believed that Germany should be reunified into a complete, peace-loving, and democratic country. Some people try to make it seem as if the Soviet Union is afraid of Germany being reunified into a peaceful and democratic country. We ask you not to believe those people. In view of what the Prime Minister said on this issue yesterday, we believe it is necessary to clarify this point.

    Since the Paris Agreements were ratified, there have been avoidable obstacles on the road to the national reunification of Germany, and we would not be completely frank if we did not point this out. You are all well aware that when the Paris Agreements were still under consideration, the Soviet Union warned about this point many times. According to these agreements, the Federal Republic of Germany has joined military groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Military Alliance, and according to these agreements, West Germany is now being remilitarized. Everyone knows that these military groups are aimed at the Soviet Union and some other peace-loving European countries. This is a fact, and no matter what words are used to refer to the so-called defensive nature of these military groups, this fact cannot be overturned.

    The Soviet Union cannot but take into account the situation that has emerged. But despite this, we are still studying possible ways to overcome the difficulties that have occurred and to try to at least gradually abolish all military groups in Europe. The Soviet Union's proposal to establish an all-European collective security system is for these purposes. By establishing a European collective security system that is sufficient to lead to the abolition of European military groups, people can find a more secure way to solve the current German problem, including the reunification of Germany.

    It has been mentioned here that the four countries have obligations regarding the settlement of the German question. One cannot but agree with this. However, the Soviet Union has always believed that the task of solving the German question, including the reunification of Germany, is primarily a matter for the Germans themselves, and therefore, in the current situation, it is a matter that requires the joint efforts of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to solve.

    Everyone knows that the vast majority of residents of the German Democratic Republic agree with this opinion. It would be completely incomprehensible if the Federal Republic of Germany were to deny this. We still believe that Germans in both parts of Germany can find common ground and will find time to consult and work together to solve the German question and overcome the difficulties on this path.

    We hope that this exchange of views will help to consider the entire German question and directly help to normalize relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.

    At the end of his speech, Mr. Adenauer reiterated the Federal Government's willingness to consider the issue of establishing diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. However, he has not yet explained his attitude to the Soviet government's proposal to establish diplomatic relations between our two countries, establish a Soviet embassy in Bonn and an embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Moscow, and mutually send ambassadors. We would like to know the opinion and response of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to this proposal.

### 布尔加宁十日在苏联同西德谈判中的发言

    布尔加宁十日在苏联同西德谈判中的发言
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科十日电：下面是布尔加宁在一九五五年九月十日的发言全文：
    昨天我们听了联邦共和国总理阿登纳先生的发言，这个发言的确使我们很感兴趣并且值得加以认真考虑。阿登纳先生谈到目前这次会谈的巨大重要性以及其中所包含的困难。我们也充分认识到这一点。
    阿登纳先生谈到他愿意完全坦率地进行这一会谈。我们也愿意这样说。
    人们不能不同意昨天所说的欧洲新战争威胁的危险性。
    苏联人民知道得很清楚，在我们的时代里战争意味着什么。他们在不久以前亲身经历过战争，尽管他们并没有威胁任何人，也没有打算侵略外国的领土，而且愿意和所有的国家和平相处。在伟大的卫国战争的四年里，苏联人民遭遇到那么大的灾难、在侵略者和战争罪犯手里受过那么大的痛苦，甚至到现在，没有一个苏联家庭回想起这件事情时能够不感到非常痛心并且产生一种由衷的抗议。
    战争给波兰、南斯拉夫和捷克斯洛伐克的人民、给法国和英国、比利时和荷兰的人民带来了严重的损失和破坏。全欧洲的人民不能忘记而且也不会忘记发动第二次世界大战的德国军国主义和法西斯主义的罪行。
    德国人民则处于不同的情况。但是，对他们来说，战争最后替他们带来的也只是巨大的损失和不幸。应当相信，现在德国人民憎恨战争的程度并不下于苏联人民。在谈到苏联人民和德国人民时，我们可以万无一失地说，他们在这方面的梦想和情绪显然有很多相同的地方。无论如何，我们相信他们并不希望让新战争爆发，而且我们认为他们应当更加团结起来以保证和平和安全，这是符合一切欧洲人民——而且不仅仅是欧洲人民——的愿望和利益的。
    我们已经保证态度坦率，因此我们必须告诉诸位，德意志联邦共和国的代表们，在战争结束后苏联已经同一部分德国人民建立和睦与友好的关系。苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的这种关系是在多方面的合作的坚实基础上发展起来的。我们毫不怀疑，苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的友好和合作是符合苏联人民和德国人民的利益的。这种关系将在平等和互不干涉内政的基础上继续发展下去。
    苏联希望同德意志联邦共和国也建立起正常关系。我们认为，在目前情况下，迟迟不让这种关系正常化是不可能有任何认真的理由的——不论这种理由想得如何巧妙。
    这种拖延既不符合苏联人民的利益，也不符合德国人民的利益。凡是为争取和平和巩固和平而努力、而且真正记得战争带来的损失和灾难的人都会同意我们两国之间的关系必须正常化。
    在西德，有时候有人说出这样的话：同苏联打交道应当“凭借实力地位”。我们在提到这种说法时不能不嗤之以鼻。人们对这种论点不能不为之失笑。德国国防军、德国、德国人民比任何人都知道得清楚，苏联以前是怎样，现在又是怎样。
    西德这一些关于“凭借实力地位”政策的谈论是怎么回事呢？显然，这一切谈论一定是那些连第二次世界大战的教训都忘记了的人发出来的。在我看来，我们参加目前会谈的双方当能同意，如果我们中间有任何人现在奉行一种相似的方针的话，在莫斯科开始的会谈将毫无意义。
    阿登纳先生说，德意志联邦共和国并不对同苏联的关系的正常化提出任何“先决条件”，苏联代表团欢迎阿登纳先生的这番话。提出“先决条件”将违反我们在这一会谈开始以前的文件往来的精神；那样做将不符合苏联和德国人民的利益。
    至于联邦总理的发言中所特别提到的两个问题，苏联政府有必要分别对每个问题表示它的意见。
    战俘问题
    联邦总理把战俘问题当作主要问题提出来。我们认为，在这里存在着某种误解。在苏联并没有德国战俘。所有德国战俘都已经被释放和遣返。只有前希特勒军队的战争罪犯在苏联，他们是因为对苏联人民、对和平和人道犯了特别凶恶的罪行而被苏联法庭定了罪的罪犯。的确，到九月一日，仍然有九千六百二十六个这样的人在我国。但是这些人是根据最人道的标准和规则都必须当作罪犯加以看管的。这些是已经失了人性的人，这些人是破坏者、纵火者、杀害老弱妇孺的凶手。苏联法庭已经给予他们应有的惩罚，不能把他们视为战俘。
    苏联人民不能忘记这些罪犯分子像在基辅的巴比耶枪杀七万人那样的严重罪行。我们不能忘记在德国集中营里被枪杀、绞死或活活烧死的千百万人。的确，人们怎能忘记从受了酷刑的妇女的头上割下来的、储存在麦丹尼克的数以吨计的妇女头发呢？我们在这里的人，曾经亲眼看见过麦丹尼克所发生的情况。有五百五十余万绝对无辜的人在麦丹尼克集中营和奥斯威辛集中营里被杀害。乌克兰人民将永远不会忘记在哈尔科夫被枪杀或者绞死的几万名无辜男女。
    我不妨提一下设在斯摩棱斯克、克拉斯诺达、斯塔夫罗波尔、伊伏夫、波尔塔发、诺夫哥罗德、奥勒尔、罗夫诺、考那斯、里加和许多其他城市中的集中营，纳粹在那里残害了数以十万计的苏联公民。人们不能忘记那些被谋杀、绞杀或活埋的无辜的人民，人们不能忘怀那些被烧毁的城市和乡村，被杀害的妇女、少年和儿童。我所提到的那九千六百二十六人就是犯下这些万恶罪行的罪犯分子。
    我还想进一步指出，如果我们要在此时此地讨论这些罪犯的问题，那就有必要由德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国的代表共同参加讨论。但是这是一个对德国的两个部分都有关系的问题。我们相信德意志联邦共和国政府代表团会觉得在目前环境下不宜于由德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国的代表共同参加讨论这个问题，所以把这个问题作为目前谈判中的一个题目显然是不合时宜的。
    重新统一德国问题
    我们完全同意重新统一德国问题是德国人民的一项重要的全国性任务。苏联政府一向一成不变地认为德国应当重新统一成为一个完整的、爱好和平和民主的国家。有些人企图使人觉得好像苏联害怕德国重新统一成为一个和平和民主的国家。我们请求你们不要相信那些人。鉴于总理先生昨天在这个问题上所发表的一段话，我们认为有必要把这点说清楚。
    自从巴黎协定被批准以来，在德国全国重新统一的道路上出现了本来可以避免的障碍，如果我们不指出这一点，我们就算不上完全坦白了。你们全都很明白，当巴黎协定还在考虑中的时候，苏联就曾经好多次就这一点提出警告。根据这些协定，德意志联邦共和国已经参加了北大西洋公约集团和西欧军事联盟这一类军事集团，同时根据这些协定，西德现在已经在重新军国主义化。任何人都知道，这些军事集团是针对苏联和某些其他爱好和平的欧洲国家的。这是一个事实，不论用什么话来提及这些军事集团的所谓防御性质，都是不能推翻这个事实的。
    苏联不能不考虑到已经出现的局面。但是尽管如此，我们仍在研究克服已经发生的困难的可能办法和设法至少是逐步取消欧洲的一切军事集团的可能性。苏联提出的建立全欧集体安全体系的建议就是为了这些目的。通过建立一个足以导致取消欧洲的军事集团的欧洲集体安全体系，人们便可以找到比较保险的办法来解决目前的德国问题，包括德国的重新统一问题。
    在这里曾经有人提到四国关于解决德国问题的义务。人们是不能不同意这一点的。但是，苏联一向认为解决德国问题，包括重新统一德国的任务，首先是德国人自己的事情，因而在目前的情况下，这是需要德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国共同努力来解决的事情。
    大家知道，德意志民主共和国的绝大多数居民都同意这个意见。如果德意志联邦共和国竟然否认这一点，那将是完全不可理解的。我们仍然相信德国两部分的德国人可以找到共同基础，并且将找到时间来进行会商，共同努力解决德国问题，克服在这条道路上的困难。
    我们希望我们这一次交换意见将有助于考虑整个德国问题和直接地有助于苏联和德意志联邦共和国关系的正常化。
    阿登纳先生在他的发言的末尾重申联邦政府愿意考虑建立苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间外交、经济和文化关系的问题。但是他还没有就苏联政府提出的关于建立我们两国间的外交关系，在波恩设立苏联大使馆和在莫斯科设立德意志联邦共和国大使馆并且互派大使的建议说明他的态度，我们愿意知道德意志联邦共和国政府对这个建议的意见和答复。
