    The German Democratic Republic is Consolidating and Developing
    Su Xin
    To discuss further development and consolidation of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic and to exchange views on other issues related to the two countries, delegations from the governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have been holding talks in Moscow since September 17. These talks are a continuation of the discussions that began during Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Berlin in July of this year. They will not only affect the relationship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic but also the development of the entire German and even European situation. Therefore, they are attracting widespread attention from international public opinion.
    The liberation of eastern Germany from Junkerdom and militarist rule and the thorough implementation of the Potsdam Agreement in eastern Germany have enabled the German people to establish a democratic, peace-loving state – the German Democratic Republic – for the first time in German history. It provides an example and a base for the democratic development of the whole of Germany, and it makes it impossible for imperialist monopoly capital to ever again push the whole of Germany onto the path of war to harm the people of European countries. Therefore, the people of all countries regard the establishment of the German Democratic Republic as a turning point in German and European history.
    In the six years since its establishment, the German Democratic Republic has made great achievements on the road of peaceful and democratic development. The consolidated alliance of the working class and the working peasants has become the unbreakable foundation of the anti-fascist democratic system of the German Democratic Republic. Under the leadership of the vanguard of the working class in democratic Germany – the Socialist Unity Party of Germany – the workers, peasants, working intellectuals, and all patriots of the German Democratic Republic are united around the National Front, which represents the broadest strata of democratic Germany, to fight for the construction of a new Germany.
    In the economic field, democratic reforms have opened up broad avenues for the smooth development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic. Thanks to the efforts of the working class in democratic Germany, the German Democratic Republic has doubled its industrial production during the implementation of its first five-year plan, and has achieved great success in the development of the metallurgical industry and the machine-building industry, which has gradually overcome the economic difficulties caused by the division of Germany. Agriculture has also developed. The number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased from more than 1,800 in 1952 to more than 5,000 now. The unit area yield and livestock numbers of agriculture have exceeded pre-war levels. The socialist foundation of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic is being consolidated and expanded. The proportion of socialist components in industry has reached about 86 percent, and in agriculture, it has reached 30 percent.
    Along with the economic upsurge, the material life of the working people of the German Democratic Republic is constantly improving. Since 1950, the German Democratic Republic has implemented sixteen price reductions, and wage levels have continued to rise. In 1954, the income of workers and staff increased by 14 percent compared to 1953. The large-scale construction of housing also demonstrates the German Democratic Republic government's great concern for the welfare of the working people, with housing construction expenditures reaching more than 730 million marks.
    The culture and art of the German Democratic Republic are developing vigorously. Those works that promoted fascism, spread national hatred, and advocated aggression and expansion have long been eliminated in democratic Germany. Replacing them are new literary and artistic works guided by the ideas of peace, democracy, and internationalism, which encourage the working people of the German Democratic Republic to work harder to build a new life. In the past few years, many schools, theaters, clubs, cultural palaces, and other cultural facilities have been established in the German Democratic Republic. They are increasingly meeting the growing cultural needs of the working people.
    The significant achievements of the German Democratic Republic in economic and cultural construction are the result of the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party and the Republic's government, and the selfless labor of the people of the German Democratic Republic, and are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The liberated working people of democratic Germany are deeply convinced that the system they have chosen is superior and fully in line with their interests, and they are rapidly developing their country along the chosen path through creative labor. The efforts of the people of the German Democratic Republic to defend their country and build their new life are consistently supported by the Soviet Union. It is precisely because of these factors that the German Democratic Republic has a vigorous vitality and can overcome various difficulties, smash various destructive conspiracies, and continue to consolidate and develop.
    In accordance with the national aspirations of the German people, the German Democratic Republic has consistently and unswervingly striven to establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. In order to promote mutual understanding between the people of East and West Germany and to restore the unity of the country on a peaceful and democratic basis, the government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic have made dozens of proposals to the West German authorities, advocating that representatives from both East and West Germany sit down at a table to jointly discuss the issue of restoring national unity. These proposals have been warmly supported by the broad masses of the German people.
    Since the first day of its establishment, the German Democratic Republic has worked actively with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies to ease international tensions and promote international cooperation. The German Democratic Republic has formed an unbreakable friendship with the fraternal countries of the peace and democracy camp, developing fraternal and sincere cooperation. The German Democratic Republic also maintains relations with many capitalist countries. It now trades with nearly one hundred countries and has signed long-term trade agreements with twenty of them.
    Due to its pursuit of a peaceful policy and active participation in international affairs, the international prestige of the German Democratic Republic has grown continuously in recent years. Peace-loving people all over the world regard the German Democratic Republic as the future of the new Germany and as a reliable friend in their struggle for human progress and world peace.
    But even now, there are still people who want to erase the achievements of the German Democratic Republic and even deny its existence. This is ridiculous and futile, as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin pointed out: "The international prestige of the German Democratic Republic is growing year by year. Talk about 'non-recognition' of the German Democratic Republic cannot stop this. The German Democratic Republic exists and develops successfully because this country has deep roots in the entire history and life of the German people. We are convinced that, whether some people like it or not, it will continue to consolidate in the future."
    The German Democratic Republic is a sovereign state and has been recognized and supported by the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democracies. The government of the German Democratic Republic effectively manages the affairs of developing the economy and culture and is warmly supported by the people. Therefore, any solution to the German problem that does not take into account the views and interests of the German Democratic Republic is bound to be unworkable. The German Democratic Republic safeguards the national interests of the German people and represents the future of Germany. Any policy that attempts to deny its existence, deny its status and rights is bound to meet with shameful bankruptcy.
    The talks held in Moscow have further strengthened the relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, it will further enhance the strength and status of the German Democratic Republic, thereby helping to resolve the German question on a peaceful and democratic basis and restore the unity of Germany.

    德意志民主共和国在巩固和发展着
    苏新
    为了商讨进一步发展和巩固苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的友好关系并就其他有关两国的问题交换意见，苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府代表团从九月十七日起在莫斯科举行会谈。这次会谈是今年七月间布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问柏林时即已开始的讨论的继续，它不仅将对苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的关系发生影响，而且也关系着整个德国以至欧洲局势的发展，因此它吸引着各国舆论的广泛注意。
    德国东部从容克制度和军国主义统治下获得解放和波茨坦协定在德国东部的彻底实施，使德国人民得以在德国的历史上第一次建立起了一个民主的爱好和平的国家——德意志民主共和国。它为整个德国的民主发展提供了榜样和基地，并且使得帝国主义垄断资本从此永远不可能再把整个德国推上战争的道路来祸害欧洲各国人民了。因此，各国人民都把德意志民主共和国的成立当作为德国历史和欧洲历史的转折点。
    在成立的六年来，德意志民主共和国已在和平民主发展的道路上取得了伟大的成就。工人阶级和劳动农民的巩固联盟已成为德意志民主共和国反法西斯民主制度的牢不可破的基础。在民主德国工人阶级的先锋队——德国统一社会党的领导之下，德意志民主共和国的工人、农民、劳动知识分子和所有的爱国人士，都团结在代表着民主德国最广泛的阶层的全国阵线周围，为建设新德国而奋斗。
    在经济方面，民主改革为顺利发展德意志民主共和国的国民经济开辟了宽广的道路。由于民主德国工人阶级的努力，德意志民主共和国在实行第一个五年计划的过程中，已把工业生产量增加了一倍，在发展冶金工业和机器制造工业方面获得了巨大的成就，这就使由于德国的分裂所产生的经济困难得到逐步的克服。农业也有了发展。农业生产合作社的数目已从一九五二年的一千八百多个增加到现在的五千多个。农业的单位面积产量和牲畜头数已超过了战前的水平。德意志民主共和国国民经济中的社会主义基础正在日益巩固和扩大。社会主义成分在工业中的比重已占到百分之八十六左右，在农业中占到百分之三十。
    随着经济的高涨，德意志民主共和国劳动人民的物质生活也不断提高。从一九五○年以来德意志民主共和国已实行了为数达十六次的减低物价，而工资水平则不断提高。一九五四年工人和职员的收入比一九五三年增加了百分之十四。住宅的大规模兴建也说明了德意志民主共和国政府对劳动人民福利的巨大关怀，住宅建筑费用的支出已达到七亿三千多万马克。
    德意志民主共和国的文化艺术正在蓬勃地发展着。那些宣扬法西斯主义、散布民族仇恨、鼓吹侵略扩张的作品在民主德国早已被清除了。代替它们的是以和平、民主和国际主义的思想为指针的新的文艺作品，它们鼓舞着德意志民主共和国劳动人民更加努力地去建设新的生活。在德意志民主共和国，过去几年内已建立了许多学校、剧院、俱乐部、文化宫和其他文化设施。它们日益满足着劳动人民的不断增长的文化需要。
    德意志民主共和国在经济和文化建设方面获得如此重大的成就，是统一社会党和共和国政府的正确领导和德意志民主共和国人民忘我劳动的结果，又是同苏联的无私援助分不开的。得到了解放的民主德国的劳动人民深刻地相信，他们所选择的制度是优越的，是完全符合他们的利益的，他们以创造性的劳动来沿着选定的道路迅速发展自己的国家。德意志民主共和国人民为保卫自己国家和建设自己新生活的努力得到苏联始终如一的支持。正是由于这些因素，所以德意志民主共和国具有蓬勃的生命力，能够克服各种困难，粉碎各种破坏性阴谋而不断巩固发展。
    按照德国人民的民族愿望，德意志民主共和国一贯坚持不渝地为争取建立一个统一、民主和爱好和平的德国而努力。为了促进东西德人民的互相谅解和在和平民主的基础上恢复国家的统一，德意志民主共和国的政府和人民议院曾经向西德当局提出过数十次建议，主张由东西德双方代表坐到一张桌子旁来共商恢复国家统一的问题。这些建议得到了德国广大人民的热烈支持。
    自从成立的第一天起，德意志民主共和国就同苏联和人民民主国家一起积极地为缓和国际紧张局势和增进国际合作而努力。德意志民主共和国已同和平民主阵营各兄弟国家结成了牢不可破的友谊，发展着兄弟般的真诚合作。德意志民主共和国也和许多资本主义国家保持着关系。现在它和近一百个国家进行贸易，并和其中二十个资本主义国家签订了长期的贸易协定。
    由于奉行了和平政策和积极参与了国际事务，德意志民主共和国的国际威信几年来不断增长。全世界爱好和平的人民都把德意志民主共和国当作新的德国的未来，当作他们争取人类进步和世界和平的斗争中的可靠朋友。
    但是直到现在还有人仍然想抹杀德意志民主共和国的成就，甚至否认它的存在。这是可笑和徒然的，正如苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁所指出的：“德意志民主共和国的国际威信在一年年增长。关于‘不承认’德意志民主共和国的言论并不能阻挡这一点。德意志民主共和国之所以存在和成功地发展，是因为这个国家在整个历史中和德国人民生活中有深厚的根基。我们确信，不管某些人喜欢或是不喜欢，今后它仍将日益巩固。”
    德意志民主共和国是一个主权国家，并且得到了苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的承认和支持。德意志民主共和国政府有效地管理着发展经济和文化的事务，得到人民的热烈拥护。因此，在处理德国问题的时候，不考虑到德意志民主共和国的意见和利益的任何解决方法都一定是行不通的。德意志民主共和国维护着德国人民的民族利益，代表着德国的未来，任何想要否认它的存在，不承认它的地位和权利的政策都必然要遭到可耻的破产。
    莫斯科举行的会谈进一步加强了苏联和德意志民主共和国的关系，同时，它也将更增强德意志民主共和国的力量和地位，从而有助于在和平民主的基础上解决德国问题，恢复德国的统一。
