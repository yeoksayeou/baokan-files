Xinhua News Agency, September 27th. Charles Judd (Chairman of the Executive Committee), head of the delegation of the United Nations Associations World Federation, and John A.F. Ennals (Secretary-General), a member of the delegation, who were invited to visit China by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, left Beijing by plane on the 27th. They stayed in Beijing for a week. Another member of the delegation, Inamullah Khan (First Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee), had already left Beijing on the 22nd.

    Judd and Ennals held a press conference with Chinese and foreign journalists on the eve of their departure from Beijing. They talked about their impressions of their trip to Beijing and their meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai. At the meeting, Ennals also outlined the work carried out by the United Nations Associations World Federation since its establishment in 1946. Then, he and Judd answered questions from reporters.

    Ennals and Judd said that they were grateful to the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs for the arrangements made for their visits to various places, and that they were satisfied with the discussions they had held to develop further contacts between the United Nations Associations World Federation and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

    Ennals said: Since 1950, the United Nations Associations World Federation has consistently held that the representatives of the People's Republic of China should replace the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the United Nations Organization. He said, "The United Nations Associations World Federation unanimously passed a resolution supporting the People's Republic of China again at its tenth conference in Bangkok this year," and this resolution has been forwarded to the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is currently in session.

    Ennals continued: At the Bangkok conference, the Federation also reaffirmed that it "believes that coexistence and cooperation are possible and appropriate even between countries with different political systems and ideologies." He said: "We hope that the recent easing of tensions, together with the growing trend of countries accepting coexistence and cooperation as the basis of treaties and declarations, can be exploited, and we recommend that these principles be applied more broadly to determine relations between countries."

    He emphasized that efforts must be made in this regard by people and non-governmental organizations, and he pointed out the importance of "peaceful settlement of all outstanding issues."

    Ennals said: The United Nations Associations World Federation has "again urged the United Nations to take steps to make the United Nations itself universal, demanding that it immediately admit all countries to participate."

    Speaking of his impressions of China, Ennals said that they were deeply impressed by the work efficiency of the Beijing No. 2 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory they had visited, and that they warmly approved of the discussions on work between the workers they had seen on one occasion.

    Judd also said that he was "extremely impressed by the workers' ingenuity and thoughtful interest in their work." Judd also said: "My deepest impression of New China is the enthusiasm of your young men and women in building the country." He said that he had visited the Central Institute for Nationalities, and he was very impressed by the fact that "so many young men and women really feel that they have a mission, that is, they want to do something to help ethnic minorities who have not always enjoyed equal opportunities."

    Regarding China's education, Ennals said that this undertaking is "making great progress," and said: "Especially in a middle school we visited, I noticed that the number of scientific instruments there is much more than in many middle schools elsewhere in the world." He said that he was "very touched by the happiness of the children and the dedication of the teachers" in New China.

    Judd said, referring to his visit to some Christian churches and a seminary in Beijing: "From what I have seen here of the Christians, I know that they are happy and they have freedom."

    When asked by a reporter what impressed him most during his stay in Beijing, Ennals said, "What impressed me very much was what is being done to build a happier life for the Chinese people. Or, I can say that what interests me most is our talks with the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and your Premier about the peaceful settlement of outstanding political issues in Asia."

    联合国协会世界联合会代表团在京招待记者
    谈他们对于北京之行以及同周恩来总理会谈的印象
    新华社二十七日讯　应中国人民外交学会邀请前来中国访问的联合国协会世界联合会代表团团长查尔斯·贾德（执行委员会主席）和团员约翰·阿·弗·恩纳尔斯（秘书长）二十七日乘飞机离开北京。他们在北京逗留了一个星期。另一位团员伊纳穆拉汗（执行委员会第一副主席）已经在二十二日离开北京。
    贾德和恩纳尔斯在离开北京的前夕举行了一次有中国和外国记者参加的记者招待会。他们在会上谈到他们对于北京之行以及他们同周恩来总理会谈的印象。恩纳尔斯在会上并且概述了联合国协会世界联合会自从一九四六年成立以来所进行的工作。然后，他和贾德回答了记者提出的问题。
    恩纳尔斯和贾德说，他们对中国人民外交学会为他们访问各地所进行的安排表示感谢，并且对他们为了发展联合国协会世界联合会和中国人民外交学会的进一步接触所进行的商谈感到满意。
    恩纳尔斯说：自从一九五○年以来，联合国协会世界联合会就一致认为应当由中华人民共和国的代表来代替联合国组织中的蒋介石集团的代表。他说：“联合国协会世界联合会今年在曼谷举行第十届会议的时候再次一致通过了一项支持中华人民共和国的决议”，这项决议已经转达给现在正在开会的联合国大会第十届会议。
    恩纳尔斯接着说：在曼谷会议上，联合会也曾经重申，它“相信甚至在有着不同的政治制度和思想意识的国家之间进行共处和合作也是可能的和适当的”。他说：“我们希望，最近的紧张局势的和缓同各国接受以共处和合作作为条约和宣言的基础这种日益增长的趋势能够加以利用，我们建议这些原则更广泛地被应用来决定各国之间的关系。”
    他强调，在这方面，人民和非政府组织必须进行努力，他并且指出了“和平解决一切悬而未决的问题”的重要性。
    恩纳尔斯说：联合国协会世界联合会已经“再次促请联合国采取步骤，使联合国本身具有普遍性，要求它立即接纳所有国家参加”。
    在谈到对中国的观感时，恩纳尔斯说，他们对于他们参观过的国营北京第二棉纺织厂的工作效率有很深的印象，他们热烈地赞同他们有一次看到的工人之间关于工作的讨论。
    贾德也说，他“对于工人们在工作中所表现的机敏和善于思索的兴趣有着极为深刻的印象”。贾德并且说：“我对新中国的最深刻的印象就是你们的青年男女建设国家的热情。”他说，他参观过中央民族学院，给他的印象非常深刻的是“这样多的青年男女真正感到他们有一个使命，那就是他们希望做一些事情来帮助一向没有享受平等机会的少数民族”。
    关于中国的教育事业，恩纳尔斯说，这个事业“正在取得巨大进展”，他说：“特别是在我们参观过的一所中学校里，我注意到那里的科学仪器的数量比世界其他地方许多中学校的科学仪器要多得多。”他说，他为新中国的“儿童们的幸福和教师们的专心致志的态度很受感动”。
    贾德在提到他参观北京的某些基督教堂和一个神学院的情况时说：“从我在这里所看到的基督教徒的情况，我知道他们很愉快，他们有自由。”
    有记者问，在逗留北京期间，什么东西印象最深刻，恩纳尔斯说，“给我印象非常深刻的就是为中国人民建设更加幸福的生活而正在做的事情。或者，我可以说，使我最感兴趣的就是我们同中国人民外交学会和你们的总理关于和平解决亚洲的悬而未决的政治问题所进行的谈话。”
