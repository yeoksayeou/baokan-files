Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 10th. The work of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales" of grain in more than 8,000 townships in Guangxi Province has been gradually implemented down to households. In Guilin and Yishan prefectures, where progress has been faster, most townships have organized the masses of farmers to repeatedly discuss the "three fixes" figures and revise them based on the opinions of the masses.

During the implementation of the grain "three fixes" down to households, various localities publicized policies through mass meetings and forums. Some meetings also conducted "three comparisons" education (comparing production development, changes in life, and price stability). At a policy forum held in Zhongdan Zhongtun, Baise County, farmers such as Liang Dong raised a total of twenty-eight questions, which were all answered after discussion. When Dingjiang Market in Lingui County announced the "three fixes" figures, farmers went to see the list at night with lanterns and torches and held discussions. After careful evaluation in Siliand Township, Liujiang County, the number of previously falsely reported grain-deficient households has been greatly reduced. Now, surplus grain households account for 93 percent of the total number of farm households in the township, and the fixed grain sales volume is more than 70,000 jin less than the total sales volume for the whole year last year.

The "three fixes" down to households work in Guangxi Province started in mid-to-late August. Various localities dispatched more than 50,000 county and district cadres to the countryside to carry out the work. There are hundreds of thousands of trained township cadres and activists. It is estimated that the "three fixes" down to households work in the whole province can be completed ahead of schedule on September 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th. Heilongjiang Province is making preparations for the grain "three fixes" down to households. The province will comprehensively implement the grain "three fixes" down to households in October.

In the past two months, various counties have successively conducted typical pilot projects of "three fixes" down to households and carried out publicity among the masses. Farmers in places where the "three fixes" down to households were piloted unanimously reflected that "they have a bottom line in their hearts, and they are more motivated to produce."

At the end of August, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee formulated detailed implementation rules for the interim measures for the unified purchase and sale of rural grain. The recent provincial grain work conference, based on the specific conditions of the province, tentatively set the grain output and fixed purchase figures for the province and various counties, and determined the food grain standards for farmers and the feed standards for livestock. Judging from the ratio of the initially determined fixed purchase quantity to the output, farmers in the province will have more surplus grain to dispose of themselves this year than in previous years. The provincial grain work conference, considering that the province has a small population and abundant land, and that there are very few agricultural households that lack grain, determined that in the "three fixes" down to households work, it will focus on doing a good job in fixing production and fixing purchase, but also do a good job in the unified sales work for a small number of grain-deficient households.

In September, rural work cadres throughout the province will generally study the interim measures for the unified purchase and sale of rural grain. Various counties will train a large number of cadres and continue to publicize the benefits and methods of the grain "three fixes" in depth among farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Hunan and Hubei provinces are actively preparing for the grain "three fixes" down to households. In August, all counties in Hunan Province held training classes, and a total of more than 120,000 grassroots cadres were trained. Hubei Province has transferred approximately 20,000 cadres from various levels of government, who will be concentrated in batches for study and then successively go to the countryside to participate in grain work and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

The two provinces have also conducted typical experiments on "three fixes" down to households. Hubei Province selected more than 100 townships in areas with different natural and economic conditions and investigated the grain field output and the grain consumption standards of various types of farm households and rural residents. The "three fixes" down to households work carried out in more than 280 townships in Hunan Province has mostly ended and is currently summarizing experiences.

Hubei Province will complete all preparatory work before the end of September. The "three fixes" down to households work in Hunan Province will be fully launched in October and November.

    广西八千多个乡粮食“三定”工作贯彻到户
    黑龙江湖北湖南进行“三定”到户准备工作
    新华社南宁十日电　广西省八千多个乡的粮食“定产、定购、定销”工作已陆续贯彻到户。进展较快的桂林、宜山两专区绝大部分乡，已组织农民群众反复讨论了“三定”数字，并根据群众意见进行了修订。
    在进行粮食“三定”到户工作中，各地通过群众大会、座谈会来宣传政策，有的会议还进行“三比”教育（比生产发展、生活变化和物价稳定）。在百色县中旦中屯举行的政策座谈会上，农民梁东等共提出了二十八个问题，经过讨论后都得到了解答。临桂县定江墟公布“三定”数字时，农民们在夜晚打着灯笼火把去看榜，并进行座谈。柳江县泗连乡经过认真评议，过去虚假的缺粮户已大大减少。现在全乡余粮户占农户总数百分之九十三，粮食定销量比去年全年销售量减少了七万多斤。
    广西省“三定”到户工作是从八月中、下旬开始的。各地曾抽调五万多名县、区干部下乡开展工作。受过训练的乡干部和积极分子有几十万人。全省“三定”到户工作估计可提前在九月二十日完成。
    新华社哈尔滨八日电　黑龙江省正在进行粮食“三定”到户的准备工作。全省将在十月份全面地把粮食“三定”贯彻到户。
    在前两个月内，各县先后作了“三定”到户的典型试办，在群众中进行了宣传。试办“三定”到户的地方的农民，一致反映“心里有了底，生产更有劲头了”。
    八月底，黑龙江省人民委员会制定了贯彻农村粮食统购统销暂行办法的实施细则。最近召开的全省粮食工作会议，根据本省具体情况，初步定下了全省和各县的粮食产量和定购数字，确定了农民的食粮标准和牲畜饲料标准。从初步确定的定购数量所占产量的比例来看，今年全省农民将有比往年更多的剩余粮食由自己支配。全省粮食工作会议考虑到本省人少地多，历来农业户缺粮的很少，确定在“三定”到户工作中，将着重搞好定产和定购，但也要做好对少数缺粮户的统销工作。
    九月份，全省农村工作干部将普遍学习农村粮食统购统销暂行办法。各县将训练大批干部，继续在农民中深入地宣传粮食“三定”的好处和做法。
    新华社九日讯　湖南、湖北两省积极进行粮食“三定”到户的准备工作。湖南省各县八月份都举办了训练班，受训的基层干部共有十二万多人。湖北省各级机关已抽调出约两万个干部，分批集中学习后，将陆续到农村参加粮食工作和互助合作运动。
    两省还进行了“三定”到户的典型试验工作。湖北省在自然条件和经济条件不同的地区，选择一百多个乡，调查了粮田产量和各类农户以及农村居民的用粮标准。湖南省在二百八十多个乡进行的“三定”到户工作，大部已结束，正在总结经验。
    湖北省将在九月底前全部完成准备工作。湖南省“三定”到户工作将在十、十一两月全面展开。
