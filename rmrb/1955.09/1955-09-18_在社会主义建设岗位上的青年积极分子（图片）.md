Young activists from all over the country who are to attend the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress are about to open in our beloved capital. More than 1,500 of the most outstanding young activists from all fronts across the country, representing the millions of young builders, have come to Beijing to report their achievements and share their experiences with the motherland; to receive instructions from the Party Central Committee, listen to the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, discuss the tasks of youth in realizing the Five-Year Plan, and propose their future plans for hard work. In the near future, a new upsurge of meritorious service for socialist construction will appear among the youth of the whole country.
