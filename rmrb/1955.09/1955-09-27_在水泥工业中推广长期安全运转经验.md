    Promote Long-Term Safe Operation Experience in the Cement Industry
    Xu Zhuoran
    The task given to the cement industry by the state in the First Five-Year Plan is to reach an annual output of six million tons by 1957.

    There are two ways to increase cement production: one is for the state to invest in building and expanding a number of factories to increase the production capacity of the cement industry; the other is to rely on existing enterprises to actively tap potential production capacity in order to increase production. At present, the main focus should be on tapping the potential of existing enterprises.

    An important method for relying on existing enterprises to increase cement production is to improve the safe operation cycle of cement kilns. Workers at the state-owned Guangzhou Cement Plant have made outstanding achievements in this regard. Their No. 3 cement kiln has set new national records for safe operation of cement kilns five times in the five years from 1950 to 1954. The lowest record was 136 days, and the highest reached 367 days. This kiln, due to its long-term safe operation, increased cement production by about 3,000 tons for the state last year. Including the saved medium repair costs, it has increased production and saved a total of 123,200 yuan for the state.

    However, at present, the safe operation cycle of cement kilns in many cement plants across the country is far behind this figure. In 1954, the average operation cycle of cement kilns nationwide (excluding cement plants under local leadership, same below) was 43.9 days, and in the first half of this year it was 38.5 days. In all cement kilns, more than 76 percent of the kilns had an operating cycle of less than 100 days!

    Judging from the above situation, it is very necessary to thoroughly promote the experience of long-term safe operation of cement kilns at the Guangzhou Cement Plant in the cement industry. If the operating cycle of cement kilns across the country can be increased to 100 days, 542,500 yuan of repair costs can be saved each year, and 274,000 tons of No. 400 cement (with a pressure resistance of 400 kilograms per square meter) can be produced. If the turnaround time of cement kilns nationwide reaches 300 days, it can save the state 962,500 yuan in repair costs and increase the production of 466,000 tons of No. 400 cement, equivalent to creating wealth of 22.4 million yuan for the state.

    In the past, the promotion of Guangzhou Cement Plant's experience in long-term safe operation of cement kilns in the cement industry has achieved certain results, increasing the turnaround time of cement kilns to some extent. In some factories where the promotion work was better, such as the No. 2 kiln of Chongqing Cement Plant, a record of continuous operation for 202 days was created by the end of February this year. However, from a national perspective, the current promotion work still has serious shortcomings:

    First, many units still lack a systematic and profound understanding of Guangzhou Cement Plant's advanced experience in long-term operation, and one-sidedly believe that long-term operation is a chemical technology problem, ignoring the importance of mechanical problems; or they believe that the main thing is high-temperature kiln coating, ignoring the protection of the kiln coating; some also believe that reasonable technical operation is enough, ignoring the uniformity of raw material composition and input into the kiln. All of these are incorrect. The experience of Guangzhou Cement Plant was created through a series of arduous work based on strengthening political and management work. The reason why their cement kiln can operate for a long time is that they pay attention to equipment maintenance. Each maintenance is planned and prepared, and is carried out under the careful leadership of a responsible engineer. It is only considered qualified when the maintenance quality fully meets the regulations; the kiln coating is firmly and smoothly applied, so that the refractory bricks will not be quickly burned and melted, and will not affect the operation of the cement kiln; after the cement kiln is operating normally, the work of protecting the kiln coating is done well. Their method of protecting the kiln coating is to strictly control the composition and quantity of raw materials and fuel, and raw materials and coal that do not meet the standards are not allowed to enter the kiln. Attention should be paid to the stability of the kiln firing system. When the combustion situation in the kiln is not good or there are abnormal situations, the feeding should be reduced in time or thin kiln skin should be added and problems such as ring formation in the kiln should be dealt with to avoid major accidents. Regular attention should be paid to the maintenance of equipment and environmental hygiene, so as to avoid small problems developing to the point where they cannot operate before shutting down for major repairs. Obviously, if you do not pay attention to the above points, the cement kiln cannot operate safely for a long time.

    Second, the promotion of advanced experience has not been combined with the improvement of the enterprise's technical management work. The average operating cycle of cement kilns at Fushun Cement Plant last year was only 18 days, but the leaders of this plant did not pay attention to it, and did not pay attention to promoting advanced experience and improving the technical management of the enterprise. At the beginning of this year, when it was clear that the plan could not be completed, the leadership personally went to the kiln and ordered the workers to implement the high-temperature kiln coating operation method. The workers were confused and had to blindly obey, resulting in increased chaos. In the first quarter, they were forced to stop the kiln for repairs 12 times, had 11 ring formation accidents, and 6 brick drop accidents, completing only 90.73 percent of the clinker plan. At the end of the second quarter, seeing that the plan could not be completed, they wanted to solve the problem by adding fluorite to the raw materials. Adding fluorite is a successful advanced experience in the cement industry in the Soviet Union and other countries, but if no prior experimental research is done, the raw materials are not mixed and fed evenly, and the technical operations cannot be adapted accordingly, production cannot be improved. Under such extremely immature conditions, Fushun Cement Plant mechanically applied raw materials mixed with fluorite to production, but still failed to complete the plan. In the second quarter, the number of kiln shutdowns for repairs increased to 18 times, ring formation and brick drop accidents increased to 31 times, and the completion of the clinker plan was less than 90 percent. In the entire first half of the year, the average operating period of cement kilns at Fushun Cement Plant was only 11.1 days, a decrease of nearly 40 percent compared with the operating period last year. Some cement plants are also not sufficiently aware of this point, and simply increase the intensity of equipment load and labor intensity, which cannot maintain the results of advanced experience for a long time. On the contrary, Guangzhou Cement Plant's use of eight automatic controls related to the main instruments of cement kiln equipment and operation and the use of "technical symposiums" to improve the technical level of workers have achieved good results.

    Third, some units' staff have not persisted in learning and promoting the advanced experience of long-term safe operation of cement kilns. For example, after Xiaotun Cement Plant promoted the advanced experience of Soviet cement kiln water cooling and Guangzhou Cement Plant's long-term safe operation of cement kilns in 1952 and 1953, it created new records for long-term safe operation within the plant three times from 1953 to 1954, ranging from 105 days to 116 days. If it were not for the influence of arrogance and complacency and the idea of one-sidedly pursuing output, the operating period of their cement kilns would have increased, and output would have also increased. However, because they only pursued increased output, they made the wrong decision to implement strong fire calcination on October 15, 1954, which caused the thermal load of the firing zone to increase excessively, causing the kiln coating and fire bricks to burn out prematurely, greatly shortening the equipment operation time. From January to April this year, Xiaotun Cement Plant failed to complete the production plan, and only completed 96 percent of the hourly quota. Not only did it fail to complete the task of 6,254 tons of clinker, but it also wasted more than 82,000 yuan in repair costs and 1,000 tons of coal. Later, after accepting the above lessons, they reversed the situation where the cement kiln could not operate for a long time, and production increased.

    Fourth, the Construction Engineering Bureau clearly stated as early as 1953 that to tap the potential of enterprises, it is necessary to promote the three major experiences of cement kilns, namely the advanced experience of Soviet rapid rotary kilns and water cooling of the firing zone, and the long-term safe operation experience of cement kilns at Guangzhou Cement Plant. These three experiences are an organically linked whole. But even now, some people have not recognized this problem. When Huaxin Cement Plant replaced the coal used for firing, the firing zone moved back, but the position of water cooling did not move back. Both kilns were burned red and had to be shut down for repairs, destroying the long-term operation. From January to April, Xiaotun Cement Plant simply accelerated the speed of the kiln and shortened the flame, and the problem of water leakage from the water cooling was not resolved. As a result, the fire bricks often burned out, and the kiln was constantly shut down for repairs. This all shows that the promotion of long-term safe operation experience cannot be carried out in isolation.

    Many facts in the past have proven that the promotion of long-term operation experience of cement kilns can not only guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the state's production plan and increase production and savings plan, but also promote the technical and economic work in the cement industry.

    This year, due to strict economy, some construction (especially civil construction) projects have been postponed or cancelled, and cement production will be reduced slightly in the second half of the year. However, this does not affect the promotion of long-term operation experience of cement kilns in the cement industry. Because, judging from my country's current cement production capacity, it is still lagging behind the needs of national construction, and small-scale production reduction is only a temporary and short-term phenomenon. What's more, cement plants are still in production! Therefore, cement plants that are currently in production should still actively promote the experience of long-term operation, strive to complete the 1955 production plan ahead of schedule, and strive for ample maintenance time for various production equipment, so as to prepare good conditions for next year's production work and the promotion of long-term operation experience of cement kilns. Some cement plants that have shut down for major kiln and equipment repairs, in addition to ensuring the quality of repairs, should start from technical aspects, equipment repairs, personnel training, and summarizing experience, so as to lay a solid foundation for promoting the experience of long-term operation of cement kilns next year. This is a problem that the leading staff of all cement plants must pay attention to and master, as the Ministry of Heavy Industry pointed out: We should make full use of this year's production reduction conditions to turn the negative factors generated by the production reduction into positive factors. The scope of work should be tightened as much as possible and appropriately. We should still advance technology in the production reduction so as to create conditions and lay a good foundation for development.

    在水泥工业中推广长期安全运转经验
    徐卓然
    国家在第一个五年计划中给予水泥工业的任务是：要在一九五七年达到年产量六百万吨的水平。
    增产水泥有两个办法：一个是国家投资新建和扩建一批工厂，提高水泥工业的生产能力；另一个是依靠现有企业，积极挖掘潜在生产能力，以增加生产。在目前，主要的应是挖掘现有企业的潜力。
    依靠现有企业增产水泥的一个重要方法，就是提高水泥窑的安全运转周期。国营广州水泥厂的工人们在这方面做出了卓越的成绩。他们的第三号水泥窑，从一九五○年到一九五四年的五年中，曾五次创造全国水泥窑安全运转的新纪录，最低的纪录为一百三十六天，最高的达到三百六十七天。这一个窑，在去年一年中，由于长期安全运转，给国家增产水泥三千吨左右。连同节省的中修费用合计在内，共给国家增产节约十二万三千二百元。
    但是，目前在全国许多水泥厂中，水泥窑的安全运转周期是远远落后于这个数字的。一九五四年，全国水泥窑（不包括地方领导的水泥厂，下同）平均运转的周期是四十三点九天，今年上半年是三十八天半。在全部水泥窑中，竟有百分之七十六以上的窑运转的周期不到一百天！
    从上述情况看，在水泥工业中深入地推广广州水泥厂水泥窑长期安全运转的经验是十分必要的。如果全国水泥窑的运转周期都能够提高到一百天，每年就可以节约五十四万二千五百元的修理费用，增产四百号水泥（每平方公尺耐压力为四百公斤）二十七万四千吨；如果全国水泥窑的周转期都达到三百天，就可以给国家节省修理费用九十六万二千五百元，增产四百号水泥四十六万六千吨，相当于为国家创造财富二千二百四十万元。
    过去，在水泥工业中推广广州水泥厂水泥窑长期安全运转经验是有一定成绩的，使水泥窑的周转日期较前有所增加。在一些推广得比较好的厂，例如重庆水泥厂的二号窑，到今年二月底也曾创造了连续运转二百零二天的纪录。但是，从全国范围来看，目前的推广工作还有严重的缺点：
    首先，许多单位对于广州水泥厂长期运转先进经验还缺乏系统深刻的理解，片面地认为长期运转就是化工技术问题，忽视机械问题的重要性；或者认为主要是高温挂窑皮，忽视保护窑皮；还有的认为技术操作合理就可以了，忽视了原料成分和入窑量的均齐，这些都是不正确的。广州水泥厂的经验是在加强政治工作和管理工作的基础上，经过一系列的艰苦工作而创造成功的。他们的水泥窑所以能够长期运转，是因为重视设备的检修工作。每次检修都有计划有准备，并且是在负责工程师的认真领导下进行的，只有在检修质量完全合乎规定时，才算合格；窑皮挂得坚固平整，使耐火砖不致很快地被烧熔，不会影响水泥窑的运转；水泥窑正常运转起来后，作好了保护窑皮的工作。他们保护窑皮的办法是严格控制原料、燃料的成分及数量，在生料和煤的成分不合格时不准入窑。注意窑的烧成制度的稳定，在窑内燃烧情况不好或有异常情况时，及时减少下料或补挂薄的窑皮和处理窑内结圈等问题，以避免重大事故的发生。经常注意设备的检修维护工作和环境的卫生工作，避免在小的毛病发展到不能运转时，才停车进行大检修。显然，如果不注意以上几点，水泥窑是无法长期安全运转的。
    第二，推广先进经验没有同改进企业的技术管理工作相结合。抚顺水泥厂去年水泥窑平均运转的周期才十八天，可是这个厂领导人员不加重视，不注意推广先进经验和改进企业的技术管理工作。今年年初眼看完不成计划了，领导上才亲自上窑，命令工人实行高温挂窑皮操作法。工人摸不着头脑，只好盲目服从，结果增加了混乱，第一季度被迫停窑检修十二次，结圈事故十一次，掉砖事故六次，只完成熟料计划的百分之九十点七三。第二季度末，眼看计划无法完成，但又想用在原料中掺用萤石来解决。掺萤石是苏联和其他国家水泥工业中成功的先进经验，但如果事先不加试验研究，原料拌合和喂料不匀，技术操作也不能相适应，是无法提高生产的。抚顺水泥厂就在这样极不成熟的条件下，生搬硬套地把掺用萤石的原料投入生产，结果仍无法完成计划。第二季度停窑检修又增加到十八次，结圈和掉砖事故增加到三十一次，完成熟料计划还不及百分之九十。整个上半年，抚顺水泥厂水泥窑的平均运转期才十一点一天，比去年运转期还降低了将近百分之四十。还有些水泥厂对这点认识不足，单纯提高设备负荷的强度和劳动强度，结果是不能使先进经验的成果长期保持下去。相反的广州水泥厂利用八种自动控制有关水泥窑设备和操作的主要仪表和利用“技术座谈会”来提高工人技术水平的办法，收到了很好的效果。
    第三，某些单位的工作人员没有坚持学习和推广水泥窑长期安全运转的先进经验。例如小屯水泥厂在一九五二年和一九五三年先后推广了苏联水泥窑水冷却的先进经验和广州水泥厂水泥窑长期安全运转的经验后，曾在一九五三年到一九五四年间三次创造了一百零五天到一百一十六天的厂内长期安全运转新纪录。如果不是由于骄傲自满情绪和片面追求产量的思想在作祟的话，他们的水泥窑运转期还会增加，产量也会再提高的。可是由于他们只追求提高产量，在一九五四年十月十五日做出了实行强火煅烧的错误决定，使烧成带热力负荷过份增加，致使窑皮和火砖过早烧垮，设备运转时间大大缩短。今年一至四月，小屯水泥厂没有完成生产计划，小时定额也只完成了百分之九十六，不仅没有完成六千二百五十四吨熟料的任务，还浪费了八万二千多元的修理费和一千吨燃煤。后来接受了以上教训，扭转了水泥窑不能长期运转的局面，产量才有了提高。
    第四，建工局从一九五三年就明确提出，挖掘企业潜力，必须推广水泥窑的三大经验，即苏联快速转窑和烧成带水冷却的先进经验，以及广州水泥厂水泥窑长期安全运转的经验。这三个经验是个有机联系的整体。但是直到现在，还有些人没有认清这个问题。华新水泥厂更换了烧成用煤时，烧成带后移了，但水冷却的位置并未后移，两个窑都被烧红，只好停车检修，破坏了长期运转。小屯水泥厂在一至四月中，由于单纯地加快了窑的转动速度，缩短火焰，水冷却漏水问题也没有解决，结果火砖经常烧垮，不断停窑检修。这都说明，推广长期安全运转的经验是不能孤立地进行。
    过去有许多事实证明，推广水泥窑长期运转的经验，不单单可以保证完成和超额完成国家的生产计划和增产节约计划，而且能够推动水泥工业中的技术工作和经济工作前进。
    今年，由于厉行节约，某些建筑（特别是民用建筑）项目被推迟或取消，下半年水泥的产量少有压缩。但是这并不影响在水泥工业中推广水泥窑长期运转的经验。因为，从我国目前水泥生产能力看，仍然是落后于国家建设需要的，小量地减产只是暂时的、短期的现象。何况目前水泥厂仍正在生产呢！因此，正在进行生产的水泥厂，仍应积极推广长期运转的经验，争取提前全面完成一九五五年生产计划，给各种生产设备争取从容的检修时间，为明年的生产工作和推广水泥窑长期运转经验准备良好的条件。某些停车检修大窑和设备的水泥厂，除保证检修质量外，应从技术、设备检修、人员训练、总结经验等方面入手，给明年推广水泥窑长期运转经验奠定牢固的基础。这是一切水泥厂的领导工作人员必须注意掌握的一个问题，正如重工业部所指示的：应充分利用今年减产条件，使减产所产生的消极因素变成积极因素，工作的面要加以可能和适当的紧缩，在减产中仍使技术前进，以便为发展创造条件、打好基础。
