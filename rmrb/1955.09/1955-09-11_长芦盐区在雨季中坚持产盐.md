Changlu Salt District Persists in Salt Production During the Rainy Season

Xinhua News Agency

This year, the salt fields in the Changlu Salt District broke the past practice of suspending production during the rainy season, seized the opportunity during the rainy season, and persisted in salt production. By the end of August, the entire salt district had completed more than 86 percent of its annual salt production plan and prepared a large amount of brine for autumn sunning.

In the process of fighting against the weather, the meteorological groups of various salt fields and workshops have been very active. As soon as the weather changes, they immediately notify the various salt flats. The workers on the salt flats try their best to make good use of the weather to rush brine and dry salt. When it rains, they quickly unfold the work of raking salt and protecting brine to reduce the loss of salt.

    长芦盐区在雨季中坚持产盐
    长芦盐区各盐场今年打破过去雨季停产的惯例，在雨季中抓紧时机，坚持产盐。到八月底，全盐区已完成全年产盐计划百分之八十六以上，并为秋晒准备了大量的卤水。
    在和天时进行斗争的过程中，各盐场和各车间的气象小组十分活跃。天气一有变化，他们就立刻通知各个盐滩。盐滩上的职工们尽量利用好天气赶卤和晒盐，遇到雨天，就迅速地展开扒盐和保卤的工作，减少盐斤的损失。　（新华社）
