    Organizing Product Appraisals
    By our reporter, Gu Lei
    In July, the industrial management departments of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee convened three professional meetings for the dyeing and printing, rubber, and fountain pen industries, respectively, including local state-owned, joint state-private, and private enterprises. At the meetings, through reports, case studies, and charts, comparisons were made of who had the most output, best quality, least waste, lowest cost, and most orderly management. The experiences of advanced units and the reasons for the backwardness of lagging units were jointly studied, so that the backward could catch up with the advanced.
    Among the three professional meetings, the dyeing and printing industry meeting was the most successful because the preparation was more thorough. To ensure the success of this meeting, under the auspices of the Fourth Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, a preparatory committee was formed, led by the Textile Industry Bureau, and including the Shanghai Textile Workers' Union, the Shanghai Wholesale Station of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Shanghai Branch of the China Coal Construction Company, the Shanghai Branch of the China Chemical Company, and the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association. The committee began its work in May. The preparatory committee established three groups: a data synthesis group, a technical exchange group, and a secretariat, responsible for reviewing and organizing typical materials on business management, quality appraisal, coal conservation, and caustic soda saving. To ensure the accuracy of the data, the preparatory committee also held various small-scale forums, inviting engineers, technicians, and veteran workers from relevant factories to participate in discussions.
    The meeting was attended by administrative leaders, union chairmen, technicians, and advanced workers from fifty-one local dyeing and printing enterprises. The Shanghai Municipal Textile Industry Bureau gave a report on "The Current Basic Situation and Future Work Direction of the Local Dyeing and Printing Industry in Shanghai," clearly pointing out the current problems in the dyeing and printing industry. The meeting also introduced the experiences of the joint state-private Da Xin Zhen Dyeing and Printing Factory and the private Mao Sheng Xing Dyeing and Printing Factory in improving quality and practicing strict economy; comprehensively summarized and introduced the experiences in saving caustic soda and coal, and overcoming defects in rolled dyed cloth and printed cloth. The meeting organized two discussions: one to allow attendees to relate to their own factory's situation, expose problems existing in production, and study plans to improve work in the second half of the year based on the spirit of thrift; the other to discuss and exchange experiences in technology and conservation.
    The main achievement of the meeting was the exposure of the backward state of the local dyeing and printing industry in Shanghai in a spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Speaking of the dyeing and printing industry, Shanghai is indeed a veteran. However, due to the pride, complacency, and conservatism of some enterprises, many kinds of printed cloth produced by various factories were dull in color and unclear in background color, with reds not red enough and whites not white enough. There were few small flower varieties and the patterns were not beautiful. Many plain-colored cloths were dull in color, easily faded, and uneven in shade from beginning to end, with stripes, dye spots, green edges, and brittleness. These poor-quality cloths aroused public dissatisfaction. This year, the Ministry of Textile Industry forwarded a letter from the Southwest region, which said: "The multi-colored mercerized satin produced by the Shanghai Wanfeng Factory is of good quality, but the color is not fast, and the shrinkage is very severe. After being exposed to the sun, the color turns gray. After washing once, it becomes cropped pants, which the masses call 'heartbreak satin'!" Many dyeing and printing products in Shanghai are not as bright, diverse, durable, lively, or popular as those from dyeing and printing factories in Qingdao, Tianjin, and the Northeast. Some people reflected: "In the Yu'nan area, as soon as Jinan's raw cloth arrives, Shanghai's raw cloth becomes unsalable. The new products of Shanghai, Fan Laming and Jing Yuan cloth, often turn red and green, causing consumers to shake their heads." In the past, Shanghai's vulcanized raw (blue cloth) products sold well in North China and Central and Southern China, but now they have been replaced by similar products from Tianjin and Jinan. This year, at a symposium on patterns and varieties held by the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, representatives from various regions also reflected that some light-colored cloths produced in Shanghai had unclear boundaries between white flowers and background colors, making them difficult to sell.
    Many leading staff members of dyeing and printing factories could not accept these opinions and still believed that Shanghai had high technical standards, a long history, and rich experience. They looked down on other places and were unwilling to learn from their experiences. In recent years, dyeing and printing factories in Tianjin and the Northeast have sent people to visit and study at dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai, but dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai have rarely sent people to visit and study elsewhere. In the first half of this year, Shanghai's dyeing and printing industry sent representatives to participate in the North China Regional Dyeing and Printing Technology Exchange Meeting. There, many dyeing and printing factory staff members humbly asked Shanghai representatives for advice. Tianjin Local State-Owned Dyeing and Printing Factory No. 1 had more than a dozen staff members studying the patterns of dyeing and printing products from various regions to absorb the advantages of various patterns and improve the quality of the factory's products. Dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai rarely did this.
    There are many reasons for not paying attention to product quality, the most important of which is that some dyeing and printing factories are only infatuated with past achievements and profits. When practicing strict economy, many factories unilaterally saved materials while neglecting product quality. Printed cloth should be bleached, but some factories omitted this process. The factories "learned" this point quickly, but they did not learn some of the experiences that could guarantee quality. For example, the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company stipulates that the rate of first-class vulcanized raw products should be 97%, and the joint state-private Da Xin Zhen Dyeing and Printing Factory averaged 99.88% in April and May. They have a set of experiences, but other factories rarely learn from them. Technical management is chaotic: there is no specific leadership for pattern design, no understanding of the requirements of the general consumers, and each factory has its own set of ingredients, with some factories even changing them at will. The four processes of sampling, engraving, color mixing, and printing in many factories are "independent kingdoms," each doing its own thing; engineers rarely go to the workshops, and testing work is also unsound. Many bad products are caused by poor cooperation and lax prevention.
    These problems were criticized at the professional meeting. Many people reviewed the past thinking of only looking backward and not forward, only focusing on output and not on quality, only seeing the advantages of their own factory and not seeing the advantages of other factories, and only pursuing profits without regard for the interests of the general consumers. After reviewing their work, many factory staff members began to formulate plans to improve work and revise conservation targets. The joint state-private Da Gong Dyeing and Printing Factory comprehensively revised various indicators, increasing the recovery rate of caustic soda from 85% to 93%, the rate of first-class mercerized raw cloth from 99.5% to 99.83%, the rate of first-class bleached cloth from 97% to 98.5%, and management expenses from a reduction of 5.7% to a reduction of 8%. Some private factories are also working on revising various indicators. The private Nanhua Dyeing and Printing Factory reduced the planned amount of insurance powder from 70 cm per piece to 60 cm, increased the rate of first-class bright red cloth from 98.5% to 99.5%, and increased the rate of first-class wool blue from 93% to 97%. Now, all factories are organizing the communication of various contents and experiences from the professional meeting and mobilizing the masses to improve product quality.
    From the several professional meetings in Shanghai, especially from the dyeing and printing professional meeting, such meetings can play two good roles in industrial production: first, to establish a spirit of mutual learning, appraisal, and learning from each other's strengths; to point out the existing shortcomings, to tell those who are arrogant and complacent that their work achievements are far from the requirements of the state and the people; and also to put forward specific experiences, so that complacent people know that "there is always someone stronger," and they must never "close themselves off" in production, but must humbly learn from others' advanced experience to overcome their own shortcomings. Second, some workers in factories with relatively backward work are content with being backward, or complain about fate, blaming the factory for being broken, the machines for being old, the technology for being low, and the experience for being lacking; professional meetings can use specific experiences to encourage and guide them forward.
    Today, when workers in industrial enterprises across the country are striving to practice strict economy and striving to complete the 1955 plan, the practice of promoting production through professional meetings is worthy of attention. In the current industrial production, regardless of heavy industry or light industry, regardless of which product, there are differences between advanced and backward in terms of output, quality, and cost. This difference is manifested between different types of enterprises and between enterprises of different sizes. Taking product cost as an example, the cost of the same specification of rubber insulated wire in the private Huali Factory is 53% higher than that of the state-owned Shanghai Wire Factory; for the same specification of electric fan, the cost per unit in the joint state-private Huasheng Factory is 94 yuan, while in the private Huanan Factory it is 135 yuan. The cost of some products in state-owned enterprises is also higher than that of private factories. For the same four-ton white Bakelite water tube boiler, the cost per unit in the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory is 53,714 yuan, while in the private Sifang Machinery Factory it is 51,036 yuan. For the same type of AC motor, the cost per unit in the state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory is 228 yuan, while in the joint state-private Xin'an Factory it is 177.2 yuan, and in the private Yuantai Factory it is 163.2 yuan. This shows that it is very necessary to organize enterprises to exchange experiences and learn from each other's strengths. If professional meetings of different sizes and styles can be held by industry, by variety, or by specification, it may be possible to find many ways to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and complete the plan.
    As for how to make professional meetings successful, from the process of the Shanghai Dyeing and Printing Professional Meeting, two points are worth noting. One is to prepare fully in advance, and the materials collected should be specific and accurate. Whether it is criticism or praise, it should be true, so that the participants are convinced, stimulated, moved, and enlightened. Second, when holding professional meetings in a city, it is best to absorb all similar enterprises to participate, so that everyone is educated, breaks down barriers, and widely exchanges experiences. When the Shanghai Municipal Textile Industry Bureau held the Dyeing and Printing Professional Meeting, it did not absorb the four state-owned dyeing and printing factories in Shanghai to participate, which was a defect, because state-owned dyeing and printing factories after all have a lot of experience in management that can be introduced; at the same time, the quality of some products of state-owned dyeing and printing factories is very poor, not as good as those in Tianjin, Qingdao and other places. If they participated in the meeting, they could also get some education and find some ways to improve product quality.

    组织产品的评比
    本报记者　顾雷
    上海市人民委员会的工业管理部门，在七月份分别召开了包括地方国营、公私合营和私营企业的印染、橡胶、金笔等三个专业会议。会上，通过报告、典型介绍和图表，看看谁的产量多、质量好、浪费少、成本低、管理秩序正常，共同研究先进单位的经验和落后单位的落后原因，使落后的赶上先进的。
    在三个专业会议中，以印染业开得较好，因为准备比较充分。为了把这个会议开好，在上海市人民委员会第四办公室主持下，以纺织工业局为主，组成了包括市纺织工会、中国花纱布公司上海批发站、中国煤建公司上海分公司、中国化工公司上海分公司、染织业同业公会的筹备委员会，从五月份开始工作。筹备委员会下设资料综合、技术交流、秘书等三个组，分别担任经营管理、质量评比、节约用煤、节省烧碱等典型材料的审核和整理工作。为了保证资料的准确，筹委会还召开了各种小型座谈会，邀请有关厂的工程技术人员、老工人参加讨论。
    出席会议的有五十一家地方印染企业的行政负责人员、工会主席、技术人员和先进工作者。市纺织工业管理局在会上作了“上海市地方印染工业目前基本情况和今后工作方向”的报告，明确指出印染业中当前存在的问题。会议还分别介绍了公私合营大新振印染厂和私营茂盛兴印染厂提高质量、厉行节约的经验；综合总结并介绍了节约烧碱和用煤的经验和克服卷染色布、印花布疵病的经验。会议组织了两次讨论：一次让到会的人联系本厂情况，揭发生产中存在的问题，根据节约的精神研究改进下半年工作的计划；另一次讨论和交流技术、节约方面的经验。
    会议的主要收获是用批评和自我批评的精神，揭发了上海地方印染业的落后状况。说起印染工业，上海的确是老资格。但由于有些企业有骄傲、自满、保守情绪，各厂生产的许多种印花布色泽暗淡、底色模糊不清，红的不红、白的不白，小花的品种少、花样不美，许多单色布的颜色灰暗，容易泛色，头梢深浅不一，出条花、染花、绿头、发脆等。这些质量坏的布，引起了群众不满。今年纺织工业部曾转来一封西南区的人民来信，信上说：“上海万丰厂的什色丝光罗缎，质地很好，但颜色不牢，缩水很厉害，太阳一晒，颜色变灰，水洗一次，变成了吊腿裤子，群众称之为‘伤心缎’！”上海有许多印染产品不如青岛、天津、东北等地印染厂的货色鲜艳、多样、结实、有生气、受人喜欢。有人反映：“在豫南地区，济南的元布一到，上海元布就滞销。上海新产品的凡拉明、精元布，经常泛红泛绿，消费者见了摇头。”过去，上海的硫化元（青布）产品畅销华北、中南地区，现在已为天津、济南的同类产品所代替。今年，在中国花纱布公司召开的花色品种座谈会上，各地代表也反映上海生产的部分浅花布白花同地色界线不清，难以销售。
    对于这些意见，许多印染厂的领导工作人员听不进去，依然认为上海的技术水平高，历史久，经验丰富，瞧不起别处，不虚心吸取别处的经验。几年来，天津、东北的印染工厂都曾派人到上海印染厂参观、学习，而上海的印染厂却很少派人到别处去参观、学习。今年上半年，上海印染业派代表参加了华北区印染技术交流会议，在那里，有许多印染厂的工作人员虚心地向上海代表请教。天津地方国营印染一厂有十几个工作人员研究各地印染产品花样，以吸收各地花样的优点，改进本厂产品质量。上海的印染厂则很少这样做。
    不重视产品质量的原因是很多的，其中最主要的是某些印染厂只醉心于已往的成就，只醉心于利润。在厉行节约时，不少厂片面节约材料而忽视产品质量。印花布本应经过漂白，有些厂却省去这一道工序。这一点，各厂“学习”得很快，但有些能够保证质量的经验，他们就不学习了。例如，中国花纱布公司规定硫化元的正品率为百分之九十七，公私合营大新振印染厂四、五月份平均达到百分之九九点八八，他们是有一套经验的，但别的厂很少去学习。在技术管理方面是混乱的：不具体领导花样的设计，不了解广大消费者的要求，配料方法各有一套，有的厂甚至随意变更。许多厂内的打样、雕刻、调色、印制等四个工序“各霸一方”，各干各的；工程师很少下车间，化验工作也不健全。有许多坏产品是由于相互配合不好、防范不严所造成的。
    这些问题，在专业会议上都受到了批判。不少人检讨了过去只向后看不向前看、只重产量不重质量、只看自己厂的长处而看不见别厂的优点、只追求利润不顾广大消费者利益的思想。很多厂的工作人员在检讨后，着手制定改进工作的计划和修订节约指标。公私合营大公印染厂比较全面地修正了各项指标，使烧碱的回收率由百分之八十五提高到九十三、丝光元布正品率由百分之九十九点五提高到九十九点八三、漂白布的正品率由百分之九十七提高到九十八点五、管理费用由降低百分之五点七提高到降低百分之八。某些私营工厂也在着手修改各项指标。私营南华印染厂保险粉计划用量由每匹七十公分降至六十公分、大红布正品率由百分之九十八点五提高到九十九点五、毛蓝正品率由百分之九十三提高到九十七。现在，各厂都在组织传达专业会上的各项内容和经验，发动群众改善产品质量。
    从上海几次的专业会议，特别是从印染专业会议来看，这样的会议可以在工业生产中起两种良好作用：一是树立相互学习、评比，取长补短的风气；提出存在的缺点，告诉那些骄傲自满的人，他们的工作成就同国家和人民的要求相差得很远；同时也提出具体的经验，使自满的人知道“强中还有强中手”，绝不能在生产上“闭关自守”，必须虚心学习别人的先进经验来克服自己的缺点。二、有些工作较为落后的工厂职工，自甘落后，或怨天尤人，埋怨厂子破、机器旧、技术低、经验少；专业会议可以用具体的经验鼓励和指引他们前进。
    在全国各工业企业职工正努力厉行节约、为完成一九五五年计划而奋斗的今天，利用专业会议的形式推动生产的做法，是值得重视的。在目前工业生产中，不管重工业或轻工业，不管哪一种产品，在产量、质量、成本方面都有先进同落后的差别。这种差别表现在不同类型的企业之间，表现在不同规模的企业之间。以产品成本为例，同样规格的橡皮绝缘线，私营华利厂的成本比国营上海电线厂高百分之五十三；同样规格的电风扇，公私合营华生厂每台成本为九十四元，而私营华南厂则是一百三十五元。国营企业的某些产品成本也有比私营厂高的。同样是四吨的白拔克水管锅炉，国营上海锅炉厂每台成本是五万三千七百一十四元，而私营四方机器厂的是五万一千零三十六元。同样的一种交流电动机，国营上海电机厂每台成本是二百二十八元，公私合营新安厂的是一百七十七元二角，私营元泰厂的是一百六十三元二角。这说明组织各企业交流经验，相互取长补短，是十分必要的。如果能够按行业、按品种或按规格，举行大小不同样式的专业会议，就可能找到许许多多增加产量、提高质量、降低成本、完成计划的方法。
    至于如何能把专业会议开好，从上海印染专业会议的过程看，有两点是值得注意的。一是事先做充分准备，搜集的材料要具体、正确，无论是批评或是表扬，都要真实，使与会者服气、受到刺激、感动和得到启发。二是在一个城市里召开专业会议，最好是吸收同类的所有的企业参加，使大家都受到教育，打破隔阂，广泛交流经验。上海市纺织工业局召开印染专业会议时，没有吸收上海四个国营印染厂参加，是一个缺陷，因为国营的印染厂毕竟在管理方面有不少经验可以介绍；同时国营印染厂也有些产品的质量很坏，比不上天津、青岛等地的产品，如果他们参加了会议，也可以得到一些教育、找到一些改进产品质量的方法。
