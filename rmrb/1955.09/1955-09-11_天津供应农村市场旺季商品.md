    Tianjin is supplying seasonal goods to rural markets.
    Trains carrying goods needed for the peak rural market season are departing from Tianjin Station one after another. In August, more than 700 train cars loaded with cloth, general merchandise, and other daily-use industrial products were shipped to Xi'an, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Baoding, Hohhot, and other places. From the second quarter to the end of August this year, the number of woolen underwear, cotton sweaters and trousers, leather gloves, and other items transferred by Tianjin's state-owned commercial departments to various regions has greatly increased compared to the same period last year.
    Based on the characteristics of this year's peak season market, Tianjin's state-owned commercial departments, in organizing the supply for the third quarter, not only added 48 new products but also expanded the purchase quantity of more than 100 kinds of commodities. In terms of cloth, the processing orders for worsted wool fabric, khaki, and denim were expanded, and more than 100 new designs of dark-colored printed cloth were added. The purchase quantity of small commodities needed by the vast rural areas, such as wooden combs, shoe eyelets, buttons, shoelaces, and hairpins, increased by 50% to 600% compared to the same period last year. Small commodities such as hemp ribbon, lamp wicks, and oil pots, which state-owned commerce had never handled before, are now also being purchased. (Xinhua News Agency)

    天津供应农村市场旺季商品
    载运农村旺季市场需要的物资的列车，正源源不断地从天津车站开出。在八月份已有七百多个车皮满载着布匹、百货等日用工业品运往西安、太原、沈阳、保定、呼和浩特等地。今年天津国营商业部门从第二季度到八月底，调往各地的绒衣裤、棉毛衫裤、皮手套等的数量，都比去年同期大大增加。
    根据今年旺季市场的特点，天津国营商业部门组织的第三季度的货源，除增加了四十八种新产品外，还扩大了一百多种商品的进货数量。布匹方面，扩大了华达呢、卡其布、劳动布等的加工订货，增加了一百多种新设计的深色花布。广大农村需要的小百货，如木梳、鞋眼、钮扣、鞋带、发卡子等进货数量比去年同期增加了半倍到六倍。过去国营商业从没有经营过的麻丝带、灯心、油壶等小商品，现在也开始进货了。　（新华社）
