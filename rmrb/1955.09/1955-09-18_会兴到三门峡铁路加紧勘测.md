    Railway from Huixing to Sanmenxia Undergoes Intensified Surveying

    Surveying is being accelerated for the railway from Huixing Station on the Longhai Railway to Sanmenxia. In the future, a large amount of materials from all over the country supporting the construction of the Sanmenxia hydro-junction project will be transported from here. Surveyors have initially surveyed three comparative lines, and after research, a line of better quality has now been selected.

    On the loess plateau between Huixing and Sanmenxia, the railway line has to pass through six deep gullies ranging from sixty meters to ninety meters. Here, surveyors from the Northwest Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who are carrying out surveying work, are tied with hemp ropes and suspended in mid-air in the deep gullies to measure the terrain. They also visited nearby old farmers and collected relevant hydrological data.

    会兴到三门峡铁路加紧勘测
    从陇海铁路线上的会兴车站到三门峡的铁路正在加紧勘测。将来全国各地支援三门峡水力枢纽工程建设的大量物资将由这里运输。勘测人员已初测了三条比较线，经过研究后，现在已选出一条质量较好的线路。
    从会兴到三门峡间的黄土台地上，铁路线要经过六条六十公尺到九十公尺的深沟。在这里进行勘测工作的铁道部西北设计分局的勘测人员们，腰里缚着麻绳吊在深沟的半空测量地形。他们还访问了附近的老农民，收集了有关的水文资料。
