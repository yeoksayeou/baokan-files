    The National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists has closed. This congress vividly demonstrated that youth are an important shock force in socialist construction, and also showed our Party's great concern and expectations for youth.
    Socialist construction is an extremely great and arduous undertaking, it is an undertaking that requires mobilizing all the strength of our country to create. The strength of the younger generation cannot be ignored, especially. Youth account for one-fifth of the national population and more than one-third of the national labor force; youth have a high degree of enthusiasm and courage to dedicate themselves to the motherland. If we do not fully mobilize them, the cause of socialist construction cannot be carried out. To build a strong socialist industrialized country requires decades of hard work, and this task mainly falls on the shoulders of the current generation of young people.
    Our Party has always attached importance to the role of youth, especially young activists, in national life, regarding young activists as a bridge connecting the broad masses of young people, as an advanced force driving the broad masses of young people, and also as an important source for cultivating and promoting cadres. In the past few years, on all fronts of socialist construction, according to incomplete statistics, more than 1,500 youth shock brigades, more than 2,300 youth advanced teams, youth advanced groups, and tens of thousands of young activists have emerged. They have indeed played a great role in promoting socialist construction. The scale of socialist construction is constantly expanding, and the tasks are also increasing. Therefore, we need more youth shock brigades, more youth advanced teams, youth advanced groups, more various kinds of technical talents and specialists. In a word, the young activists we need are not tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, but millions or tens of millions. That is to say, to cultivate and train a shock army for socialist construction from the younger generation; and let this shock army unite the young masses with the people of the whole country to fight for building a socialist society. This has become an urgent and important task for our Party organizations and the Communist Youth League organizations.
    To cultivate young activists, first of all, according to the characteristics of young people, we must trust them, guide them, and use them, and give play to their enthusiasm and creativity. The growth of the Zhang Baifa steel bar workers' youth shock brigade of the Sixth Construction Engineering Company of Beijing is an example. After this team was established, the League's general branch and administrative leaders on the construction site used them with great trust, and they all overfulfilled their tasks. In the seventy-one tasks accepted in 1954, this team broke the labor quota sixty-nine times, with a total average reaching 145% of the quota. Therefore, the entire team was rated as a model in the Beijing construction industry. This fact shows that as long as we trust and use young people boldly, they will be brave enough to take responsibility and be able to act independently; they will grow up in constant work and study.
    In the work of cultivating young activists, we must, in accordance with the characteristics of young people, pay attention to using various organizational forms that can inspire young people's enthusiasm and creativity. For example, organizing youth shock brigades, youth advanced teams, youth advanced groups, youth workshops, youth open-hearth furnaces, etc. in basic construction sites and factories and mines; in the movement to increase production and practice economy, various places have organized youth supervision posts, youth conservation teams, etc.; in rural areas, youth grain picking teams, youth grass-cutting and fertilizer accumulation teams, advanced technology research groups, etc. have been organized. Through these practical works and struggles, not only can the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of young people be greatly improved, but also the advanced and shock role of the broad masses of young people in socialist construction can be fully brought into play. Many young activists who participated in this conference emerged from these activities. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen provinces and cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Liaoning, and Shanxi, since May of this year alone, young people in various places have collected a total of more than 90,000 tons of scrap steel, 967 tons of non-ferrous metals, and more than 560,000 pieces of discarded tools in the activities of collecting abandoned materials. This also shows that these activities are very meaningful. Party organizations and Communist Youth League organizations in various places should, in accordance with the specific conditions of their localities and in conjunction with the various initiatives put forward to the youth of the country at this conference, create more organizational forms so that the broad masses of young people can play a greater role in socialist construction.
    According to the characteristics of young people, in the work of cultivating and educating the younger generation, we must adhere to the policy of patiently guiding, setting examples, and conducting education and encouragement from the positive side. For the foreseeable shortcomings of young people and the mistakes that may occur in their work, we should pay attention to using tips and education methods in advance to prevent them. For the mistakes that some young people have already made, we should give appropriate criticism in a timely manner, but we must prevent and oppose the aristocratic master-style attitude of criticizing, accusing, and struggling against young people's mistakes and shortcomings at every turn. The heroic deeds of the Soviet Union's Paul, Zoya and Shura, and China's Wu Yunduo, Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, etc., have had a profound impact on the Chinese youth generation in terms of spirit and morality, which fully proves the great role of positive education in setting examples. Since the second half of 1953, the Jiangxi Provincial Communist Youth League organization began to give extensive, timely and appropriate commendations to youth model units, youth outstanding models and youth activists that emerged in various fields. This has greatly promoted the encouragement and education of youth and the cultivation of youth activists. Some people have compiled this demonstration effect into four sentences, which are: "There are role models in everything, commendations are given every year, young people have great energy, and leaders have strong confidence." This further proves that the positive education approach has a huge effect on the cultivation and education of young people.
    We believe that under the encouragement of the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists, and under the leadership of the young activists who participated in this conference, as long as we adhere to the correct policy and use the correct methods, activists from the broad masses of young people will surely emerge in large numbers.

### 努力培养更多的青年积极分子

    努力培养更多的青年积极分子
    全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会闭幕了。这次大会生动地证明了青年在社会主义建设中是一支重要的突击力量，也显示了我们党对青年的极大的关怀和期望。
    社会主义建设是极其伟大而又艰巨的事业，是要动员我们国家的一切力量去创造的事业，青年一代的力量尤其不能忽视。青年占全国人口的五分之一，占全国劳动力的三分之一以上；青年具有献身祖国的高度热情和勇气。如果我们不把他们充分地动员起来，社会主义建设事业是无法进行的。而要建成一个强大的社会主义工业化的国家，需要几十年的艰苦努力，这个任务主要就落在现在的青年一代的肩上。
    我们党一向就重视青年特别是青年积极分子在国家生活中的作用，把青年积极分子看作联系广大青年群众的桥梁，看作带动广大青年群众的先进力量，同时也把青年积极分子作为培养和提拔干部的重要源泉。几年以来，在社会主义建设的各个战线上，根据不完全统计，已经涌现了一千五百多个青年突击队，两千三百多个青年先进班，青年先进组，以及成千上万的青年积极分子，他们对社会主义建设的确起了很大的推动作用。社会主义建设的规模在不断扩大，任务也随着加重。因此，我们需要更多的青年突击队，更多的青年先进班，青年先进组，更多的各种各样的技术人才和专门家，一句话，我们需要的青年积极分子已不是几万几十万，而是几百万几千万。这就是说，从青年一代中培养和训练一支社会主义建设的突击大军；并由这支突击大军去团结青年群众同全国人民一道，为建成社会主义社会而斗争，这就成为我们党组织和青年团组织的一项迫切而重大的任务。
    要培养青年积极分子，首先要根据青年的特点，信任他们、引导他们和使用他们，发挥他们的积极性和创造性。北京市第六建筑工程公司张百发钢筋工青年突击队的成长就是一例。这个队建立以后，工地上的团总支和行政领导上就很信任地使用他们，他们都超额完成了任务。在一九五四年接受的七十一次任务中，这个队有六十九次突破了劳动定额，总平均达到定额的百分之一百四十五，于是全队被评为北京市建筑业模范。这个事实说明，只要我们对青年们是大胆地加以信任和使用，他们就会勇于负责并且能够独立活动；他们就会在不断的工作和学习中成长起来。
    在培养青年积极分子的工作中，必须按照青年的特点，注意运用各种各样能够启发青年的积极性和创造性的组织形式。比如在基本建设工地和厂矿企业组织青年突击队，青年先进班，青年先进组，青年车间，青年平炉等；在增产节约运动中，各地组织了青年监督岗，青年节约队等；在农村中组织了青年拣粮小组，青年打草积肥小组，先进技术研究小组等等。通过这些实际工作和斗争不但可以大大提高广大青年的社会主义觉悟，同时还可以充分发挥广大青年在社会主义建设中的先进的突击作用。参加这次大会的很多青年积极分子就是在这种活动中涌现出来的。根据上海、天津、北京、辽宁、山西等十七个省市的不完全统计，仅仅今年五月以来各地青年在收集遗弃材料的活动中，就一共收集了废钢铁九万多吨，有色金属九百六十七吨和被遗弃的工具五十六万多件。这也说明这些活动是很有意义的。各地党组织和青年团组织应该根据当地的具体条件，结合这次大会向全国青年提出的各种倡议，创造更多的组织形式，让广大青年在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用。
    按照青年的特点，在培养和教育青年一代的工作中，必须坚持循循善诱、典型示范、从正面进行教育和鼓励的方针。对可以预见到的青年的缺点和青年在工作中可能发生的错误，应该注意事前用提示和教育的方法，加以防止，对某些青年已经发生的错误，应该及时地适当地给以批评，但必须防止和反对那种对青年的错误和缺点动辄批评、指责和斗争的贵族老爷式的态度。苏联的保尔、卓娅和舒拉，中国的吴运铎、杨根思、黄继光等等的英雄事迹给中国的青年一代在精神上和道德上的深刻影响，就充分证明典型示范的正面教育的巨大作用。江西省青年团组织，从一九五三年下半年以来，开始对各方面涌现出来的青年模范单位、青年优秀典型以及青年积极分子进行广泛的、适时而又恰当的表扬，这对鼓舞和教育青年，培养青年积极分子产生了很大的推动作用。有人把这种示范作用编成四句话，这就是：“事事有榜样，年年有表扬，青年劲头大，领导信心强”。这更证明正面教育的作法对青年的培养和教育的效果是巨大的。
    我们相信，在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的鼓舞之下，在参加这次大会的青年积极分子的带动之下，只要我们坚持正确的方针，运用正确的方法，广大青年群众中的积极分子一定会大批地涌现出来。
