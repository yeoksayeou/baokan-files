US Monopoly Capital in West Germany
Xi Lingsheng

With the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements, US monopoly capital's interest in investing in West German arms enterprises has grown even greater. The moment the agreement was signed last year, it sparked a new wave of investment in West Germany in the United States. The "New York Herald Tribune" reported last November: "It is hoped that the current American investment boom in West Germany will become even more active. The German consulate in the United States has received many applications from Americans willing to open branches in Germany." Since then, Citibank has established a branch in Düsseldorf, West Germany; General Motors has decided to invest 300 million marks in a factory near Frankfurt am Main; Wilson, chairman of the board of supervisors of the American "New York Grace Corporation," visited West Germany in February this year to invest in West Germany's chemical industry. Recently, many new cartel agreements have been concluded between US and West German monopoly capital. Through all these activities, the power of US monopoly capital is stepping up its infiltration into West Germany to further control West Germany's economy.

It is known that US monopoly capital originally had a great influence in Germany. After the war, this influence was further expanded. For ten years, relying on the occupation system in West Germany, US monopoly capital has strengthened its control over the West German economy through various means. In the name of compensation and restitution of foreign capital, US monopoly capital easily acquired many West German enterprises at home and abroad. At the same time, the US occupation authorities implemented so-called "de-cartelization" in West Germany, nominally dispersing West German monopoly organizations, while US monopoly capital took the opportunity to acquire shares of West German enterprises at low prices, establishing control in various enterprises. For example, American capitalists once acquired a large number of shares of the IG Farben chemical concern on the "black market" at 40% of their face value, thus controlling this enterprise. US monopoly capital also formed US-German joint monopoly organizations in West Germany's major industrial sectors and poured large amounts of loans and funds into these enterprises, thereby strengthening US capital's control in these enterprises. For example, US monopoly capital provided loans to Germany's largest steel concern, "Vereinigte Stahlwerke" (United Steelworks), and obtained the right of veto on the board of directors, manipulating this monopoly enterprise. In addition, American capitalists also used the method of concluding patent agreements to gain control over the production of West German companies.

For this reason, US monopoly capital has greatly strengthened its position in many important industrial sectors of West Germany. According to incomplete statistics, US investment in West Germany amounts to approximately 3 billion marks. The vast majority of these investments are concentrated in military-related sectors, with the oil industry ranking first, the electrical industry second, and the automotive industry third. In addition to controlling important enterprises such as IG Farben chemical industry company and "Vereinigte Stahlwerke" through the occupation authorities, US monopoly organizations have also controlled more than 500 West German enterprises, with a total capital of 7.6 billion marks. In West Germany's oil industry, US capital accounts for 31.7% of the total fixed capital. The vast majority of this is controlled by Mobil Oil. In the automotive industry, US General Motors and Ford Motor Company, through the West German Opel automobile factory and German Ford Motor Company, control approximately 50% of West Germany's total automotive production. In the electrical industry, the German Electrical Company controlled by the US Morgan Consortium and West Germany's Siemens Company jointly control 75% of the total fixed capital of this industrial sector. In addition, nearly 30% of West German crude steel production is in foreign hands, mainly in the hands of American capitalists. The coal mines in the Ruhr area are mainly concentrated in the hands of the Thyssen and Stinnes groups, and a large portion of the shares of Thyssen enterprises are owned by US monopoly capital; in the enterprises of the Stinnes group, US capital holds 53% of the shares.

The infiltration and expansion of US monopoly capital into West Germany has brought them huge profits. According to German newspapers, foreign capitalists receive approximately 1 billion marks in profits annually from their German branches, most of which goes to American capitalists. For example, General Motors earned 311 million marks from the Opel automobile factory in the four years from 1949 to 1952. The German branch of US-owned Mobil Oil Company made a profit of 70 million marks in 1954 alone. American monopolists obtained approximately 640 million marks in remuneration in 1954 alone by adopting the method of concluding patent agreements with West German companies. US monopoly capital is particularly enthusiastic about West Germany's rearmament because they see that the expansion of West German arms enterprises will provide them with even greater profits. A United Press report on July 14 stated that West German stocks were "becoming increasingly popular" in the United States.

US monopoly capital is also using West German monopoly capital to undermine the competitive position of countries such as Britain and France in the capitalist market. West Germany's general wages are lower than those of the United States, Britain, and France, coupled with government subsidies, lower export commodity prices, shorter delivery times, and other reasons, so it occupies a favorable position in the competition, squeezing out British and French commodities everywhere. In recent years, West German commodities have surpassed those of Britain and France in the markets of Western Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, and their influence in Southeast Asia and French North Africa is also constantly growing. The largest quantities of West German export goods are chemicals, electrical equipment, automobiles, textiles, and machinery. Most of these are related to industrial sectors controlled or invested in by the United States. For example, Opel factories and German Ford Motor Company, subsidiaries of General Motors, are serious rivals of British and French automobile merchants.

West German monopoly capital is using American investment and American political and economic factors to preserve and restore its strength. They share maximum profits with US monopoly capital in the exploitation of the West German working people and in external economic expansion. This is why some people in the West German ruling group are willing to violate Germany's national interests and follow the United States' foreign policy.

Of course, another aspect of the relationship between US and German monopoly capital cannot be ignored. With the restoration of West Germany's economic strength, West German monopoly capital is increasingly demanding to gain a more independent position. West German weekly "Vorwärts" (Forward) in Düsseldorf once said: "Germany must...use all economic and political means to get rid of American financial and political guardianship." West German Economics Minister Erhard, in a book he authored, also openly advocated that West German monopoly capital should strengthen its expansion in the dollar area. This trend is reflected in the West German political situation, that is, many bourgeois political leaders and newspapers have recently demanded that Germany restore its unification and embark on a path of independence and self-reliance. The request by former "Blank Office" planning director Colonel Bohning and West German Federal Parliament member Stangner, along with forty other socially prominent figures, for foreign troops to withdraw from Germany, and the drafting of a German regulation that does not participate in any military alliance, is an illustrative example. Within the West German Free Democratic Party, German Party, and Christian Democratic Union and other bourgeois parties, a force is also emerging that opposes completely following US policy. This situation demonstrates the strong pressure of the German people's demand for independence, and also shows a contradiction that is germinating and developing between German monopoly capital and US monopoly capital.

    美国垄断资本在西德
    席林生
    随着巴黎协定的批准和实施，美国垄断资本对于西德军火企业投资的兴趣更大了。这个协定在去年刚一签订，就在美国引起了向西德投资的新的热潮。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”在去年十一月曾经报道说：“希望目前在西德已经活跃起来的美国投资热潮能够更加活跃。德国驻美领事馆收到许多愿意在德国开设分公司的美国人的申请书。”从那时候起，美国花旗银行在西德杜塞尔多夫设立了分行；通用汽车公司决定在美因河畔法兰克福附近的汽车厂投资三亿马克；美国“纽约格雷斯公司”康采恩监察委员会主席威尔逊今年二月到了西德，打算对西德的化学工业进行投资。最近美国和西德垄断资本之间纷纷缔结许多新的卡特尔协定。通过这一切活动，美国垄断资本的势力正在加紧渗入西德，来进一步控制西德的经济。
    人们知道，美国垄断资本在德国原来就有很大的势力。战后，这种势力更为扩大了。十年来，依靠着对西德的占领制度，美国垄断资本通过各种方法来加强对西德经济的控制。在赔偿和归还外国资本的名义下，美国垄断资本轻易地把西德许多国内外企业弄到手里。同时，美国占领当局在西德实行了所谓“非卡特尔化”，把西德垄断组织在名义上加以分散，而美国垄断资本借此机会以低价收购西德各企业的股票，在各企业中建立了控制权。例如美国资本家曾在“黑市”上以票面价值的百分之四十的价格大量收购法本化学康采恩的股票，而控制了这一个企业。美国垄断资本还在西德各主要工业部门组成美德联合垄断组织，并把大量贷款和资金倾注到这些企业中，从而加强美国资本在这些企业中的控制。例如美国垄断资本给予德国最大的钢铁康采恩“联合炼钢厂”以贷款，而取得在董事会中的否决权，操纵了这个垄断企业。此外美国资本家还利用缔结专利权合同的办法，获得对西德公司生产的控制。
    由于这种缘故，美国垄断资本已在西德的许多重要工业部门中大大地加强了它们的地位。根据不完全统计，美国在西德的投资约计三十亿马克。这些投资绝大部分是集中在同军事有关的部门中，其中以石油工业为第一位，电气工业占第二位，汽车工业占第三位。美国垄断组织除了通过占领当局控制了法本化学工业公司、“联合炼钢厂”等重要企业外，还控制了五百多家西德企业，这些企业的资本总额达七十六亿马克。在西德的石油工业中，美国资本占有整个固定资本的百分之三十一点七。其中绝大部分由美孚石油公司所控制。在汽车工业中，美国通用汽车公司和福特汽车公司通过了西德的奥泊尔汽车工厂和德国福特汽车公司，控制了约占西德汽车总生产量的百分之五十。在电气工业中，美国摩根财团所控制的德国电气总公司和西德的西门子公司，共同控制了这一工业部门全部固定资本的百分之七十五。此外将近百分之三十的西德原钢生产是在外国人手中，其中主要是在美国资本家的手中。鲁尔区的煤矿主要集中在蒂森和斯丁尼斯集团的手中，而蒂森企业的很大一部分股票为美国垄断资本所有；在斯丁尼斯集团的企业中，美国资本掌握着百分之五十三的股份。
    美国垄断资本对西德的渗入和扩张，使他们获得了巨大的利润。据德国报纸估计，外国资本家每年从他们的德国分厂中所得到的利润达十亿马克，其中大部分归美国资本家所有。例如通用汽车公司在一九四九年到一九五二年的四年中从奥泊尔汽车工厂就获得三亿一千一百万马克的利润。美商美孚油公司德国分公司在一九五四年一年就获利七千万马克。美国垄断资本家采取和西德公司缔结专利权合同的办法，就在一九五四年一年中获得了六亿四千万左右马克的报酬。美国垄断资本特别热衷于西德的重新武装，就是因为他们看到西德军火企业的扩充将为他们提供更大的利润。美国合众社七月十四日的报道说，西德的股票在美国“越来越红了”。
    美国垄断资本并且利用西德垄断资本来打击英、法等国在资本主义市场上的竞争地位。西德一般工资较美国和英、法等国为低，加上政府津贴、出口商品价格较低、交货期短等等原因，因此在竞争中居于有利的地位，处处排挤英、法的商品。近年来，西德商品在西欧、中东、拉丁美洲的市场上，其势力都已超过了英法，在东南亚和法属北非的势力也在不断增长。在西德出口货物中数量最多的是化学品、电气装备、汽车、纺织品和机器。这些大多跟美国所控制或投资的工业部门有关系。例如通用汽车公司的附属公司奥泊尔工厂和德国福特汽车公司，就是英、法汽车商人的严重敌手。
    西德垄断资本利用美国的投资，利用美国方面的政治和经济的因素，来保存和恢复自己的实力。他们在对西德劳动人民的剥削中，在对外的经济扩张中，和美国垄断资本分享最大限度的利润。这就是为什么在西德统治集团的某些人中，他们甘愿违背德国的民族利益，追随美国的对外政策。
    当然，对于美德垄断资本的关系，还不能不看到另外一面。随着西德经济力量的恢复，西德垄断资本正在日益强烈地要求取得更多的独立地位。西德杜塞尔多夫的“前进”周刊就曾说过：“德国必须……用一切经济和政治的办法来摆脱美国的财政和政治的监护”。西德经济部长艾哈德在他所著的一本书中，也公开主张西德垄断资本应加强在美元区的扩张。这种趋势反映在西德政治局势中，就是最近许多资产阶级政治领袖和报刊纷纷要求德国恢复统一并走上独立自主的道路。前“布兰克部”计划处处长波宁上校和西德联邦议会议员斯丹格纳等四十名社会著名人士要求外国军队从德国撤退，以及拟定一个不参加任何军事联盟的德国的法规，就是一个具有说明性的例子。在西德的自由民主党、德意志党和基督教民主联盟等资产阶级政党内部，也发生着一种反对完全追随美国政策的力量。这种情形表明了德国人民的独立要求的强大压力，同时也表明了德国垄断资本对美国垄断资本的一种正在滋生和发展着的矛盾。
