The Ministry of Higher Education of the People's Republic of China has formulated the "Implementation Measures for People's Grants for General Students in National Universities and Colleges (Excluding Higher Normal Schools)" and issued instructions to all national universities and colleges and relevant departments to implement these measures.

The instructions stated that since the implementation of the system of granting People's Grants to all students in national universities and colleges in 1952, it has played a role in ensuring the completion of the state's task of cultivating construction talents. However, on the other hand, it has also generated considerable waste and the incorrect idea that "everything should be provided by the state" among some students.

In the past two or three years, with the development of the national economy, more and more families have been able to provide for their children to enter universities and colleges. At the same time, the standards for student grants in universities and colleges have not been adjusted, which has had some impact on student meals. In order to use People's Grants more rationally and appropriately raise the food standards for poor students without increasing the state's financial burden, the Ministry of Higher Education has, with the approval of the State Council, changed the previous system of granting People's Grants to all general students to a system of granting People's Grants to some students based on their family economic situation.

The instructions emphasized that this change of system is a complex and meticulous task. The presidents and deans of all universities and colleges should explain in detail to the students the basis for the state's change of the grant system, and educate students to save state funds to support socialist construction and to consider whether to apply based on their own economic situation in a practical and realistic manner. It is necessary to prevent those without difficulties from requesting subsidies and to avoid activists leading the way, not applying even if they have difficulties. The application and approval procedures for grants must be simplified as much as possible, and students should not be mobilized to evaluate or conduct mutual comparisons.

The new implementation measures for People's Grants for general students in national universities and colleges stipulate that People's Grants include regular subsidies and temporary subsidies. Regular subsidies are divided into food subsidies (which are further divided into three types: full, two-thirds, and one-half food subsidies) and subsidies for daily learning and living supplies. Temporary subsidies are divided into subsidies for learning, bedding, and other items. The measures also made necessary provisions for the children of revolutionary martyrs, ethnic minorities, returned overseas Chinese students, and students in sports and navigation majors.

These new implementation measures for People's Grants for general students in national universities and colleges will be implemented from October this year for both new and old students.

    高等教育部制定发给学生助学金的新办法
    中华人民共和国高等教育部制定了“全国高等学校（不包括高等师范学校）一般学生人民助学金实施办法”，并向全国各高等学校及各有关部门发出了执行这个办法的指示。
    指示中说，全国高等学校学生，自一九五二年实行全体发给人民助学金制以来，对保证完成国家培养建设人材的任务，起了一定的作用。但在另一方面，在部分学生中也产生了不少浪费现象和“一切应由国家供给”的不正确思想。
      近两三年来，随着国民经济的发展，越来越多的家庭已经有条件供给子女进入高等学校学习，同时，高等学校学生助学金标准一直没有调整，因而对学生伙食也有些影响。为了更合理地使用人民助学金，并在不增加国家财政负担的前提下，适当地提高贫苦学生的伙食标准，高等教育部已报经国务院批准，将以前施行的一般学生全体发给人民助学金的制度，改为根据学生家庭经济情况部分发给人民助学金的制度。
    指示中着重指出：这一制度的改变是一件复杂、细致的工作，各高等学校校、院长应向学生详细地说明国家改变助学金制度的根据，教育学生为节约国家资金支援社会主义建设，根据自己的经济情况实事求是地考虑是否申请。既要防止没有困难而要求补助；又要避免积极分子带头，有困难也不申请。助学金的审批手续必须力求简便，不得动员学生评议或进行互相评比。
    全国高等学校一般学生人民助学金新的实施办法中规定，人民助学金包括定期补助费和临时补助费。定期补助费分为伙食补助费（又分为补助全部、三分之二和二分之一伙食费三种）和日常学习、生活用品补助费。临时补助费分为学习、被服和其他补助费。办法中并对革命烈士子女、少数民族、归国华侨学生及体育、航海专业的学生作了必要的照顾。
    这项新的高等学校一般学生人民助学金实施办法，不论新生旧生，一律自今年十月份开始实行。
