Several Problems in the Health Work of Anshan, Fushun, and Shenyang
National People's Congress Delegate Shen Qizhen

Anshan, Fushun, and Shenyang are currently undergoing large-scale industrial construction in accordance with the nation's First Five-Year Plan. The number of factories and mines being rebuilt, expanded, and newly built is increasing daily. Based on what I saw during my inspection in June of this year, factories and mines constructed according to Soviet standards generally have safety equipment and working conditions, such as ventilation, cooling, and dust removal, that meet health requirements. Other factories and mines have also begun to pay attention to improving safety equipment and working conditions and have achieved some results. However, some factories and mines still lack understanding of industrial hygiene, or are limited by economic and technical difficulties, and industrial hygiene has not been improved. For example, in the Shenyang Chemical Plant's 666 workshop that we inspected, benzene gas was overflowing. The newly built Ku'an Thiazole workshop in the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory did not have proper ventilation equipment, which has serious implications for the health of workers. In addition, according to statistics from the health bureaus of the three cities, harmful gases in many factories have not been effectively treated. In response to the above situation, health departments must carry out effective health supervision, promptly bring this to the attention of the factories, and jointly study solutions with the factory's technical departments. Currently, most of the larger factories have central laboratories. If some additional equipment can be added, the factory's own technical capabilities can be used to study measures to improve the workshop environment. For example, Fushun Petroleum Factory No. 1 is currently using the factory's central laboratory to study how to recover oil from the industrial wastewater discharged by the factory, which will make valuable contributions to solving the treatment of the factory's industrial wastewater.

The industrial construction of the three cities had no long-term planning during the enemy and puppet period, and industrial wastewater and domestic sewage were discharged everywhere without treatment. Currently, industrial wastewater and domestic sewage in Fushun City flow into the Hun River from eighteen discharge outlets separately, without proper treatment before discharge. The Nanhu scenic area in Shenyang City, located downstream of Fushun, is also polluted by the industrial wastewater and domestic sewage discharged by Fushun City. At the same time, Shenyang City lacks sewage treatment equipment, and a large amount of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage from the city also flows into the Hun River. Because Shenyang City has more types of industries, and the chemical substances contained in various industrial wastewaters are more complex, the pollution of the Hun River is further aggravated. In addition, Fushun City's water supply and drainage system is very chaotic, and most water sources are close to the Hun River, intertwined with the eighteen discharge outlets. For example, the domestic sewage discharge outlet of the newly built residential area in Dongzhou is located upstream of the city's water source, and there are one domestic sewage discharge outlet and three industrial wastewater discharge outlets upstream of the Fushun urban area water source, and seven domestic sewage discharge outlets and nine industrial wastewater discharge outlets upstream of the Petroleum Factory No. 3 water source, making the water source highly susceptible to pollution.

In order to improve the water quality of the Hun River and improve the chaotic situation of the water supply and drainage system in Fushun City, relevant parties should conduct investigations on the flow rate, flow velocity, water quality, degree of pollution, and self-purification capacity of the main stream of the Hun River from Fushun to Liaoyang in sections, and formulate a treatment plan based on the investigation results. It would be best to build a reservoir at a suitable location upstream of the Hun River to supply water to the entire city. However, before the reservoir is built, attention should still be paid to the environmental sanitation of the original water sources, regular water quality inspections should be carried out, especially bacteriological inspections, and work to protect the water sources should be strengthened.

As for the drainage system, it should also be gradually and comprehensively transformed. Domestic sewage must be appropriately concentrated according to the situation and treated before discharge. Domestic sewage can not only provide fertilizer, but also be used to treat industrial wastewater. For example, according to research by the Central Institute of Hygiene, the carbolic acid content in industrial wastewater from Shijingshan, Beijing, is 2/1000, which is about 100 times higher than the allowable amount. If treated with domestic sewage, more than 95% of the carbolic acid can be removed after eight hours. The main industrial wastewater in Fushun City is petroleum industrial wastewater. According to observation, the oil content in the wastewater seems to be higher than that of Dalian Petroleum Factory. If appropriate methods can be studied to recover oil from the wastewater, it will not only avoid polluting the river water, but also reduce a large amount of production losses. In addition, the water supply and drainage system in Anshan City is also very chaotic. For example, the sewage discharged from Taiping Village flows directly into the Sha River, which seriously affects the water source. A treatment plan must be quickly studied and implemented.

The issue of air protection in the three cities must be studied as soon as possible. According to the report from the Fushun City Health Bureau, the daily amount of smoke and dust fallout in the city is very large. There are many public opinions, and the health department should study and take appropriate measures together with the industrial design department based on the degree of harm. For example, the Fushun City Thermal Power Plant is located in the center of the city, and the amount of smoke and dust discharged is extremely large. It can be considered to adopt the cyclone water washing dust collector device designed according to Soviet data by the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant to reduce smoke and dust. All the equipment of this dust collector can be manufactured with domestic raw materials, and each unit costs no more than 100,000 yuan, and the dust removal efficiency can reach more than 80%. All pulverized coal boilers can be used. As for other various smelting industries, chemical industries, cement industries, etc., further research should be conducted to use high-voltage electricity to collect smoke and dust. Using high-voltage electricity to collect smoke and dust can not only achieve a dust removal effect of 99%, but also recover a large amount of valuable metals and other industrial raw materials from the smoke and dust. Someone has calculated that a certain smelting plant in Shenyang City discharges a large amount of sulfur dioxide gas, which is extremely harmful to human health, from its chimneys every year. If it can be recovered as a raw material for manufacturing sulfuric acid, 40,000 tons of sulfuric acid can be produced every year. The equipment for collecting smoke and dust using high-voltage electricity generally consumes very little electricity, has high work efficiency, and requires little maintenance cost. However, because high-voltage equipment such as high-voltage rectifiers (which convert AC voltage into DC voltage) and insulation supports cannot be manufactured domestically for the time being, the equipment investment may be higher. It is hoped that the State Construction Commission will instruct scientific research institutions to cooperate closely with industrial departments to conduct planned research and quickly find a solution.

The factories and mines in the three cities have built workers' canteens over the years, which has played a certain role in improving workers' health. In the future, the operation and management of canteens should be further strengthened, and meals should be prepared according to the nutritional value of the food. This year, the government has allocated more refined grains and less coarse grains. In the future, workers' demands should be considered, and the allocation ratio of coarse and refined grains should be changed to allocate more coarse grains. On the one hand, this can reduce the economic burden on workers, and on the other hand, it can increase workers' nutrition. Since liberation, the supply of vegetables in the three cities has been greatly improved. For example, vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Anshan City have well-organized organizations. Under the slogan of "advance, yield later, and stagger in the middle" of the local agricultural department, the supply of vegetables from June to October every year has been basically resolved. In the peak months of July, August, and September, the supply even exceeds demand, but vegetables are still lacking in spring and winter. In order to ensure a constant and sufficient supply of vitamins, further research should be conducted to improve vegetable storage methods, and appropriately expand the cultivation of fine vegetables such as green onions, garlic, peppers, cucumbers, and tomatoes in warm cellars and greenhouses. At present, health-preserving meals for heavy industrial workers have been widely promoted, workers in toxic gas workshops and high-temperature workshops have been partially given a certain amount of milk, and some miners can eat in the tunnels, but there are still miners who work continuously in the tunnels for eight hours without eating, which consumes too much physical strength. Relevant parties should solve this problem.

    鞍山、抚顺、沈阳三市卫生工作中的几个问题
    全国人民代表大会代表  沈其震
    鞍山、抚顺、沈阳三个城市现在正在根据国家第一个五年计划进行大规模的工业建设，改建、扩建、新建厂矿日益增多。就我在今年六月进行视察时所看到的，凡按照苏联标准设计修建的工厂矿山，安全设备和劳动条件，如通风、降温、排尘等，多已适合健康要求，其他一些工厂矿山也已开始注意安全设备和劳动条件的改善，并已取得某些成绩。但还有某些厂矿对工矿卫生仍缺乏认识，或因限于经济上和技术上的困难，厂矿卫生还未得到改善。例如我们视察过的沈阳化工厂六六六车间苯气四溢，东北制药厂新建矿胺噻唑车间没有装置适当的通风设备，对于工人健康都是有严重影响的。此外，根据三个城市卫生局的统计资料，不少工厂的有害气体还未作有效处理。针对以上情况，卫生部门必须进行有效的卫生监督，迅速提请厂方注意，并同厂方技术部门共同研究解决办法。现在，规模较大的工厂大多数设有中心试验室，倘能稍添设备，即可利用工厂本身技术力量研究改善车间工作环境的措施。例如抚顺石油一厂现在正在利用该厂中心试验室研究如何从该厂排出工业废水中收回石油的问题，对于解决该厂工业废水的处理将能作出有价值的贡献。
    三个城市的工业建设，在敌伪时期原无长远的规划，工业废水和生活污水均不经处理随处排出。现在，抚顺市工业废水和生活污水从十八个排水口分别流入浑河，都没有在排出前加以适当处理。位于抚顺下游的沈阳市南湖风景区，湖水也被抚顺市排出的工业废水和生活污水所污染。同时，沈阳市缺乏下水处理设备，全市工业废水和生活污水也大量流入浑河。因沈阳市工业种类更多，各种工业废水所含化学物质更为复杂，更加加重了浑河的污染程度。此外，抚顺市上下水道系统非常紊乱，大多数水源地都靠近浑河，同十八个排水口相互错杂。例如东洲新建居民区生活污水排出口位于全市水源最上游，抚顺市区水源地上游有一个生活污水和三个工业废水排出口，石油三厂水源地上游有七个生活污水和九个工业废水排出口，水源地污染可能性很大。
    为了改善浑河的水质和改善抚顺市上下水道系统的紊乱情况，有关方面应该对浑河干流上自抚顺下至辽阳分段对流量、流速、水质、污染程度、自净能力等进行调查，并且根据调查结果制定处理计划。最好在浑河上游选择适当地点建立水库，供给全市用水，但在水库尚未修建以前，仍应经常注意原有水源地的环境卫生情况，定期检查水质，特别要注意细菌学的检查，加强保护水源地的工作。
    至于下水系统，也应当逐步进行全面改造，生活污水必须根据情况适当地加以集中，在排出前必须进行处理。生活污水不仅可以供给肥料，并且可以利用处理工业废水。例如根据中央卫生研究院的研究，北京石景山工业废水中石炭酸含量为千分之二，超出容许量约一百倍，如用生活污水处理，经过八小时后石炭酸含量百分之九十五以上可以去除。抚顺市工业废水主要为石油工业废水，根据观察，废水中石油含量似较大连石油厂为高。倘能研究采用适当方法将废水中石油收回，不仅可以避免污染河水，并且可以减少生产上的大量损失。此外，鞍山市上下水系统也非常紊乱，例如自太平村排出的污水直接流入沙河，影响水源极为严重，必须迅速研究处理办法。
    三个城市的大气保护问题必须及早研究。根据抚顺市卫生局汇报，该市每日烟尘降落量很大。群众意见颇多，卫生部门应当根据危害情况同工业设计部门共同研究采取适当措施。例如抚顺市火力发电厂位于全市中心，烟尘排出量极大，可以考虑采用上海杨树浦发电厂按照苏联资料设计的旋风水洗式除尘器的装置，减少烟尘。这种除尘器全部设备都可用国产原料制造，每具造价不超过十万元，除尘效率可达百分之八十以上，一切粉煤锅炉都可采用。至于其他各种冶炼工业、化学工业、水泥工业等，则应进一步研究利用高压电捕集烟尘。利用高压电捕集烟尘，不仅可以得到百分之九十九的除尘效果，并且可以从烟尘中收回大量有价值的金属及其他工业原料。曾有人计算，沈阳市某冶炼厂每年自烟囱排出大量的对人的健康极有害的二氧化硫气体，倘能收回作为制造硫酸的原料，每年可以生产四万吨硫酸。利用高压电捕集烟尘的设备，一般消耗电量很小，工作效率很高，维持费用不大。但因高压电设备如高压整流机（将交流电压变成直流电压）、绝缘支持物等国内一时还不能制造，设备投资可能较高。希望国家建设委员会责成科学研究机关密切同工业部门配合进行有计划的研究，迅速求得解决。
    三个城市的工厂矿山历年都增建了工人食堂，对于改进工人健康起了一定作用。今后应进一步加强食堂的经营管理，根据食物的营养价值调配膳食。今年政府分配细粮较多，粗粮较少。今后应考虑工人要求，改变粗粮细粮分配比例，分配较多粗粮，一方面既可减少工人经济负担，另方面又可增进工人营养。解放以来，三个城市的菜蔬供应已大有改进。例如鞍山市郊区菜农已有健全组织，在当地农业部门的“提前、让后、中间排开”的口号下，每年六月至十月的菜蔬供应基本上已获得解决，在七、八、九三个旺月甚至供过于求，但在春冬两季菜蔬仍然缺乏。为了解决维生素的经常充分供应，应当进一步研究改进菜蔬储藏方法，并适当地扩大暖窖温室中葱、蒜、辣椒、黄瓜、西红柿等细菜的栽培。目前重工业工人的保健饭已普遍推行，有毒气体车间和高温车间工人已部分配给了一定分量的牛奶，采矿工人已有一部分可在坑道进食，但仍有矿工在坑道作业连续八小时不进食物，体力消耗太多，这种问题有关方面应加以解决。
