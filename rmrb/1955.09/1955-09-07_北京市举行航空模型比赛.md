At the Beijing Fourth Aeromodelling Competition held on the 4th, Wang Qinian, a student from the Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University, had his rubber-band powered model airplane stay in the air for 152 seconds on its first flight. This greatly exceeded the highest record of 78.8 seconds in the rubber-band powered model airplane flight at the Beijing Third Aeromodelling Competition held in 1954.

A total of 117 male and female athletes from 24 secondary schools participated in this competition, with 125 towline, rubber-band powered, and catapult model airplanes participating in different levels of competition. These model airplanes were mostly designed by the young athletes themselves or made according to advanced aeromodelling airplane designs from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other people's democratic countries.

In the high school group's Class 3 towline model airplane competition, Shi Zhida, a student from Beijing No. 25 Middle School, achieved a total flight time of 357.5 seconds in three flights, winning first place. Zheng Long, a fifteen-year-old Young Pioneer and student from Beijing No. 3 Girls' Middle School, used a towline model airplane that she designed and built during the summer vacation to participate in the junior high school group's Class 2 towline model airplane competition, achieving a total score of 222.3 seconds.

    北京市举行航空模型比赛
    在四日举行的北京市第四届航空模型比赛大会上，北京师范大学附属中学学生汪耆年的橡筋动力模型飞机第一次飞行时，在空中停留了一百五十二秒钟，大大超过了一九五四年举行的北京市第三届航空模型比赛橡筋动力模型飞机飞行的最高成绩——七十八秒八。
    这次大会共有二十四个中等学校的一百一十七名男、女运动员参加，有一百二十五架牵引、橡筋动力和弹射模型飞机参加了不同级别的比赛。这些模型飞机大都是青年和少年运动员们自己设计或按照苏联和捷克斯洛伐克等人民民主国家先进的航空模型飞机图样制作的。
    在高中组三级牵引模型飞机的比赛中，北京市第二十五中学学生师志达的模型飞机，三次飞行的总成绩是三百五十七秒五，获得第一名。十五岁的少年先锋队员、北京市第三女子中学学生郑珑用她在暑假中设计和制作的牵引模型飞机，参加了初中组二级牵引模型飞机比赛，总成绩达到二百二十二秒三。　（新华社）
