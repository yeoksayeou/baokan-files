Put the Grain "Three Fixes" Policy into Effect at the Household Level

    Actively Increase Grain Production to Support National Construction
    Han En, Representative of the National People's Congress,
    Director of the Happiness Road Agricultural Production Cooperative, Jilin Province

    The "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" promulgated by the State Council has greatly encouraged us farmers. The grain issue is a major event of utmost concern to the people of the whole country, and our government has consistently attached importance to it. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the government has vigorously led and helped farmers across the country to develop agricultural production and increase grain production, and has implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain since the winter of 1953. The implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain policy has brought countless benefits to the people of the whole country. This policy not only guarantees the grain needs of people in industrial and mining areas and cities, but also guarantees the grain needs of people in grain-deficient rural areas, disaster areas, and farmers in cash crop areas. Take our agricultural cooperative as an example. Our cooperative has suffered from natural disasters for four consecutive years, and the grain has been insufficient every year. We have received timely supplies from the state. For example, in 1954, our cooperative's farmland was affected by disasters, and grain production decreased. The entire cooperative only sold 100,000 jin of revolving grain to the state, while this year we received 120,000 jin of coarse grain supplied by the state. Thanks to the state's support and assistance in grain supply and production, coupled with the efforts of all members, the living standards of our cooperative members have not been affected by the disasters. Over the past few years, our cooperative has also been continuously consolidated and developed, and now it is a fully socialist agricultural cooperative with 153 members.

    In order to further improve the unified purchase and sale of grain, the state has implemented the method of fixing grain production, purchase, and sale. This is fully in line with the requirements of the broad masses of farmers. We warmly support and will resolutely implement this method. The "Provisional Measures for the Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" promulgated by the State Council has made specific provisions for fixing grain production, purchase, and sale, which has put farmers at ease. This method stipulates that the amount of grain that farmers sell to the state will remain unchanged for three years starting this year. If farmers increase production, the state will no longer increase purchases. After farmers complete the grain purchase task, the surplus grain will be completely at their own disposal. How considerate the state is to farmers! Livestock feed, grain for raising pigs, and seeds are all appropriately set aside. Therefore, the members of our cooperative are very satisfied with the "Three Fixes" method. For example, member Zhang Jichen said: "My family of five can retain 2,650 jin of rations according to regulations; if we pay attention to saving, 2,000 jin will be enough." Therefore, with this "Three Fixes" method, we farmers are more encouraged to actively produce grain and support the country's socialist construction. According to the growth of our cooperative's crops, we can guarantee to sell 570,000 jin of grain to the state this year. In order to make the crops mature quickly and not be affected by early frost, we have plowed autumn ridges for four hectares of cornfields and weeded twenty hectares of soybean fields once; for paddy fields, in addition to weeding and cutting grass from the field ridges, we also use methods such as draining water and sun-drying rice to promote early maturity of rice. We must also do a good job in preparing for the autumn harvest, ensuring that every grain returns home and saving grain. In order to change the situation of insufficient and low-quality manure fertilizer, we carried out manure accumulation work during the slack season this year. At present, we have accumulated 6,000 carts of manure, which is enough to meet the needs of 60% of the cooperative's farmland.

    积极增产粮食支援国家建设
    全国人民代表大会代表
    吉林省幸福之路农业生产合作社主任  韩恩
    国务院公布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”，使我们农民受到了很大的鼓舞。粮食问题是全国人民最关心的一件大事，我们的政府也是一贯地重视粮食问题的。从中华人民共和国成立起，政府就大力领导和帮助全国农民发展农业生产，增产粮食，并从一九五三年冬季开始实行了粮食统购统销政策。粮食统购统销政策的实行，给全国人民带来的好处是说不完的。这一政策不但保证了工矿区和城市人民对粮食的需要，而且保证了农村缺粮人民、灾区人民、经济作物区农民对粮食的需要。就拿我们农业合作社来说吧，我们社连遭四年自然灾害，每年粮食不足，都及时得到了国家的供应。例如，一九五四年我们社的农田受灾，粮食减产，全社只向国家卖出了十万斤周转粮，而今年得到国家供应的粗粮就有十二万斤。由于国家在粮食供应和生产方面的支持和帮助，再加全体社员的努力，并没有因为受灾而影响我们社社员的生活水平。几年来，我们社也在不断地巩固和发展，现在它已经是一个拥有一百五十三户社员的完全社会主义性质的农业合作社了。
    为了进一步改进粮食统购统销工作，国家实行了粮食定产、定购、定销的办法，这是完全符合广大农民的要求的，我们热烈拥护并将坚决执行这个办法。在国务院公布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”里，对粮食定产、定购、定销都作了具体的规定，使得农民心里有了底。这个办法规定，农民向国家交售粮食的数量，自今年起三年不变，农民增产，国家不再增购，农民完成粮食征购任务后，余粮完全归自己自由支配。国家对农民的照顾多周到呀，牲口饲料，养猪用的粮食和种籽都给适当地留出来。因此，我们社的社员们对“三定”办法都非常满意。如社员张继臣说：“我家五口人按规定能够留两千六百五十斤口粮；如果注意节约，有两千斤就够了。”所以，有了这个“三定”办法，更能鼓励我们农民积极生产粮食，支援国家社会主义建设。根据我们社的庄稼生长情况，今年可保证卖给国家五十七万斤粮食。为了使庄稼成熟的快，不受早霜侵袭，我们已给四公顷玉米田放了秋垅，给二十公顷大豆田拔了一遍大草；对于水稻田，除拔稻稗割地埂子草外，并用撤水晒稻等办法促进水稻早熟。我们还要做好秋收准备工作，保证颗粒还家，节约粮食。为了改变粪肥不足和质量不高的情况，我们在今年挂锄期间开展了积肥工作，目前已积肥六千车，足够满足全社百分之六十的农田的需要。
