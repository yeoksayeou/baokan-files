Nearly 20,000 Farmers from Coastal Fujian Sign Up to Participate in Mountain Area Economic Development
Harbin Mobilizes a Large Number of Surplus Laborers to Rural Areas for Production

Farmers in the coastal areas of Fujian Province are responding to the government's call and actively requesting to participate in the development of the mountain area economy. By the end of August, according to statistics from Fuqing, Hui'an, Minhou, Putian, and other counties, nearly 20,000 volunteer laborers had signed up. Among them, the first batch of more than 1,300 volunteer laborers from Fuqing, Putian, and Minhou counties departed in August for northern Fujian mountain areas such as Nanping, Jianyang, Pucheng, Shuiji, and Youxi. More than 10,000 volunteer laborers in the second batch from various regions are also actively preparing and will arrive in the mountain areas within this month.

People in various parts of Fujian are vying to participate in the glorious cause of developing the mountain areas with the spirit of socialist builders. The number of volunteer laborers requesting to participate in the development of the mountain areas in various regions has greatly exceeded the original plan, some even exceeding the original plan by two or three times. In the Beizhai and other four townships of the Fourth District of Fuqing County, there were 47 moving examples of fathers sending sons, wives sending husbands, and brothers encouraging each other to participate in the development of the mountain areas. In Dingxi Township, Dongshan County, not only young men enthusiastically responded to the government's call, but young women also vied to participate in the development of the mountain areas. A young female agricultural cooperative member, Lin Xueying, requested the local work team to approve her going to the mountain areas six times in a row. Zhang Shanzai, an elderly woman in her seventies, also requested to go to the mountain areas, saying, "Although I am old, I can help young female volunteer laborers take care of their children."

As of September 4, statistics from various districts and streets in Harbin City show that more than 6,000 households with more than 21,000 people have gone to 19 counties in Heilongjiang Province to participate in agricultural production. More than 1,900 households and more than 3,400 people have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production.

The counties attach great importance to the work of immigration, preparing grain, resettlement housing, and land for the immigrants. The local people also helped the immigrants move their belongings, deliver green vegetables, and soybean paste. The immigrants generally reflected that "the government and the local people's care for them is truly meticulous, and they will definitely work hard in production in the future."

Currently, the immigrants who have gone to various counties have joined agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and most of the immigrants have participated in wheat harvesting and firewood gathering. The elderly and women have also gone to glean wheat. The immigrants have sent letters to their relatives and friends reporting on the situation in the countryside and thanking the government for its concern for the people. (Pang Zhimin)

    福建沿海近两万农民报名参加开发山区经济
    哈尔滨市动员大批剩余劳动力去农村生产
    福建沿海地区农民响应政府号召，纷纷要求参加开发山区经济。到八月底止，据福清、惠安、闽侯、莆田等县统计，报名的志愿劳动者已近两万人。其中福清、莆田、闽侯等三县首批志愿劳动者一千三百多人，已于八月份先后出发前往南平、建阳、浦城、水吉、尤溪等闽北山区。各地第二批志愿劳动者一万多人也正在积极准备，本月内即可到达山区。
    福建各地群众都以社会主义建设者的精神，争先要求参加开发山区的光荣事业。各地要求参加开发山区的志愿劳动者人数都大大超过了原订计划，有的甚至超过原订计划的两三倍。福清县四区北宅等四个乡出现了四十七起父送子、妻送郎、兄弟互相鼓励参加开发山区的生动事例。东山县顶西乡不但小伙子们热烈响应政府号召，就是青年妇女们也都争先要求参加开发山区的工作。年轻的女农业社员林雪英一连六次要求当地工作组批准她前往山区。七十多岁的老太太张山仔也要求去山区，她说：“我虽然年老，但可以帮助女青年志愿劳动者照顾小孩。”　　（新前）
    哈尔滨市各区街截至九月四日的统计，已有六千多户二万一千多人去黑龙江省内十九个县参加农业生产。一千九百多户、三千四百多人回籍参加农业生产。
    各县对移民工作都非常重视，为移民准备了粮食，安置房屋和土地等。当地群众也帮助移民搬物品、送青菜、大酱等。移民普遍反映“政府和当地群众对他们的关怀真是无微不至，今后一定努力生产”。
    目前去各县的移民都参加了农业生产合作社和互助组，并且大部分移民均参加了麦收和打柴，老年和妇女也去拣麦子。移民纷纷来信向其亲友报告去农村的情况和感谢政府对人民的关怀。（庞志敏）
