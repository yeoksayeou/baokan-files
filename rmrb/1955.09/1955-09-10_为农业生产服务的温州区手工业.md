Wenzhou district's handicraft production in Zhejiang province occupies a very important position in the rural economy. Among the 61 handicraft industries in the district, 17 are in the production of means of production such as iron, wood, and bamboo products. In implementing the handicraft cooperative movement to serve agricultural production, the district had organized 573 handicraft production cooperatives (groups) by July of this year, accounting for 26.5% of the total number of handicraft workers.

In recent years, handicrafts have played a significant role in supporting agricultural and fishery production. According to statistics from 13 counties including Pingyang, Wenling, Yueqing, Huangyan, Rui'an, and Lishui, the total output value of handicrafts last year was over 72.27 million yuan, producing 600,000 various agricultural and fishery tools, an increase of 15% compared to 1953. At the same time, due to the development of handicraft cooperative organizations, the handicraft economy has gradually been brought into the orbit of national planning. According to statistics from 15 counties, 145 cooperatives and 151 groups have established production and sales relationships with the national economy and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, carrying out planned production. For example, in 1954, Huangyan County sold 16,497 pieces of agricultural tools through production-sales integration and product exhibitions, gradually normalizing and stabilizing the handicraft economy.

In serving agricultural production, handicraft production cooperatives (groups) actively improved tools and operating techniques based on rural changes, creating and improving agricultural tools suitable for farmers' needs. For example, after the popularization of the double-cropping rice system on 110,000 mu throughout the district last year, many handicraft production cooperatives (groups) not only improved existing agricultural tools such as hoes, plows, and harrows, but also created and invented advanced agricultural tools such as ox-drawn rice threshers, paddy field cultivators, rice root digging "three-sided fast," and rolling harrows. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 44 types of tools were improved and created in the district. For example, the successful creation of the bamboo splitting machine increased production efficiency by tenfold, pioneering the use of machinery in the bamboo weaving industry, and was listed as one of the 16 national product creations and improvements in the Beijing Handicraft Products Exhibition. The improvement of production technology not only improved product quality but also reduced product prices, allowing farmers to buy inexpensive and high-quality agricultural tools. During the busy farming season, many cooperatives and groups also organized to go to the countryside to repair agricultural tools for farmers. In the second quarter of this year alone, 80 handicraft production cooperatives (groups) mobilized a total of 646 handicraft workers to go to the countryside, which was warmly welcomed by the masses.

With the development of production, the economic income of handicraft workers in the Wenzhou district has also increased relatively. According to statistics at the end of 1954, the wage income of ordinary handicraft production cooperative (group) members increased by about 20% compared to 1953. The public accumulation of handicraft production cooperatives (groups) in the district reached more than 44,400 yuan, laying an economic foundation for the future semi-mechanization and mechanization of handicrafts.

    为农业生产服务的温州区手工业
    哲中
    浙江温州区手工业生产在农村经济中占着很重要的地位。全区六十一个手工业行业，其中铁、木、竹器等生产资料行业占十七个。在贯彻为农业生产服务的手工业合作化运动中，全区到今年七月份已组织五百七十三个手工业生产合作社（组），占手工业总人数的百分之二十六点五。
    几年以来，手工业对支持农、渔业生产起了很大作用。据平阳、温岭、乐清、黄岩、瑞安、丽水等十三个县统计，去年手工业总产值七千二百二十七万多元，生产各种农、渔业工具六十万件，比一九五三年增加了百分之十五。同时，由于手工业合作组织的发展，使手工业经济逐步纳入国家计划轨道。据十五个县统计，已经有一百四十五个社和一百五十一个组同国家经济和各级供销合作社建立了产销关系，进行有计划的生产。如黄岩县手工业一九五四年通过产销结合、产品展览等方式，成交农具一万六千四百九十七件，使手工业经济逐步趋向正常稳固。
    在为农业生产服务中，手工业生产社（组），根据农村变化积极改进工具和操作技术，创造和改良了适合农民需要的农具。如去年全区普遍改变耕作制度推广连作稻十一万亩以后，就有许多手工业生产社（组），不仅改良了旧有锄头、犁耙等农具，而且创造、发明了牛拉打稻机、水田中耕器、掘稻根“三面快”、滚耙等先进农具。据不完全统计，全区共改良和创造工具四十四种。如劈篾机创造成功，使生产效率提高十倍，开创了篾业使用机器的先例，在北京手工业产品展览中被列为全国十六种产品创造改进之一。生产技术的改进，不仅提高了产品质量，并降低了产品价格，使农民买到价廉物美的农具。在农忙季节，不少社、组，还组织下乡为农民修补农具。单今年第二季度，全区就有八十个手工业生产社（组），共动员六百四十六个手工业者下乡，受到群众热烈欢迎。
    随着生产的发展，温州区手工业者的经济收入也相对增长了。据一九五四年底统计，一般手工业生产社（组）员的工资收入都比一九五三年增加百分之二十左右。全区手工业生产社（组）的公共积累达四万四千四百多元，为今后手工业半机械化和机械化奠下了经济基础。
