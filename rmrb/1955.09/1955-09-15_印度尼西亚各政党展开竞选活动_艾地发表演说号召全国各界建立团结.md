According to the "People's Daily" in Jakarta, D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indonesia, delivered a speech at a mass rally in Yogyakarta on the 11th. Aidit called for the establishment of unity in the struggle for complete national independence, for the interests of all sectors of the nation, and for the defense of the people's democratic rights. He said that the general election should build unity among all the people to confront Dutch colonialism.

Aidit said that if the Communist Party of Indonesia wins the general election, it will establish a national united government supported by the broad masses of the people, and it will elect Sukarno as president, if he continues to maintain the current unity and implement the five basic tasks mentioned in his Independence Day speech, such as strengthening unity and recovering West Irian.

On the same day, the Communist Party of Indonesia convened a mass rally in Jakarta. Lukman, First Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indonesia, detailed the criminal nature of the Round Table Conference agreements and the attitude of the Communist Party of Indonesia in advocating the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements, eliminating the "Darul Islam" armed bandits, and improving the status of women. CPI leaders Alimin and women's leader Mrs. Umi Sarjono also delivered campaign speeches at the meeting.

The Communist Party of Indonesia also convened a mass rally in Semarang on the 12th. A non-party candidate, Mrs. de Susanto, said at the meeting that the Communist Party of Indonesia's program opened the door for women to win freedom and rights. She called on the people to vote for the Communist Party of Indonesia. The speech of another non-party candidate, Professor Purbodiningrat, was also read at the meeting, as he could not attend the meeting. His speech pointed out that the Communist Party of Indonesia's program of establishing a united government is in line with the wishes of the Indonesian people.

Gani, one of the leaders of the Indonesian Nationalist Party and former Minister of Transportation, delivered a speech at a mass rally in Medan. He called on Indonesian residents to vote for the Nationalist Party. Gani criticized the anti-corruption measures of the Harahap cabinet as unfair and politically biased.

According to "Abadi," the Masyumi Party convened a mass rally in Garut, West Java, on the 11th. Masyumi Party leader Sukiman delivered a campaign speech at the meeting.

Leaders of the Indonesian Socialist Party are now traveling in the southeastern provinces, delivering campaign speeches.

    据雅加达“人民日报”报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地十一日在日惹的一次群众大会上发表演说。艾地号召在为争取完全的民族独立、为全国各界的利益和为保卫人民的民主权利而斗争中建立团结。他说，普选应该在全体人民中间建立团结以对付荷兰殖民主义。
    艾地说，假如印度尼西亚共产党在普选中获胜，它将建立得到广大人民支持的民族联合政府，并且它将选举苏加诺为总统，如果他继续保持目前的团结和实行他在独立日演说中提到的加强团结和收复西伊里安等五项基本任务的政策的话。
    同一天，印度尼西亚共产党在雅加达召集了群众大会。印度尼西亚共产党第一副总书记鲁克曼在会上详细说明了圆桌会议协定的罪恶性质，以及印度尼西亚共产党主张废除圆桌会议协定、肃清“回教国运动”武装匪徒和提高妇女地位的态度。在会上发表竞选演说的还有印度尼西亚共产党领导人阿利明和妇女领袖乌米·萨约诺夫人等。

    印度尼西亚国民党领袖之一、前交通部长干尼在棉兰的一个群众集会发表演说。他要求印度尼西亚居民投票选举国民党。干尼批评哈拉哈普内阁的反贪污措施是不公平的和有政治偏见的。
