    Shenyang Transformer Factory's Metalworking Shop
    Promotes the Advanced Experience of Saving by Implementing "Raw Material Free Workdays"
    (Our report) The workers in the metalworking shop of Shenyang Transformer Factory are learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union's "Raw Material Free Workday" and have saved a lot of raw materials.
    "Raw Material Free Workday" is the savings experience of the workers at the "Paris Commune" shoe factory in Moscow, Soviet Union. The workers at the "Paris Commune" shoe factory saved various raw materials for making shoes bit by bit every day, and on the last day of the month, they used all the raw materials saved to make shoes. According to the specific situation of their workshop, the workers of the Shenyang Transformer Factory's metalworking shop decided to take the work section as a unit. After saving a certain amount of raw materials in daily parts processing, they arranged a "Raw Material Free Workday" on one or several machine tools at any time according to the requirements of the work plan. In this way, the remaining "material heads" from processing in the workshop can be reprocessed into finished products of good quality. Another source of raw materials for "Raw Material Free Workdays" is broken copper and scrap iron picked up by workers outside the workshop.
    July 13th was the first "Raw Material Free Workday" in this workshop. By August 22nd, they had arranged nineteen "Raw Material Free Workdays", saving the state a total of 381.28 yuan worth of raw materials.
    Every day, the workers try to save raw materials bit by bit. Many workers have prepared a small wooden box next to the machine tool, and even the little "material heads" saved are placed in the wooden box. Zhang Qinggui saved a lot of "material heads" when cutting the raw materials for the "top contact post", and now he has processed these "material heads" into "connecting heads". Zhang Dejiu alone picked up steel materials with a total length of about fourteen or five meters outside. In the past, "material heads" and iron blocks were everywhere when cleaning in this workshop, but now they are nowhere to be seen.

### 沈阳变压器厂金工车间  推行“不领原材料工作日”的先进节约经验

    沈阳变压器厂金工车间
    推行“不领原材料工作日”的先进节约经验
    本报讯　沈阳变压器厂金工车间工人学习苏联“不领原材料工作日”的先进经验，节约了不少原材料。
    “不领原材料工作日”是苏联莫斯科“巴黎公社”制鞋厂的节约经验。“巴黎公社”制鞋厂工人日常一点一滴地节约制鞋的各种原材料，到月末的一天，就全部用节约下来的原材料来做鞋。沈阳变压器厂金工车间工人根据本车间的具体情况，确定以工段为单位，在日常零件加工中节约下来的原材料有一定数量以后，就根据作业计划的要求，随时在一台或几台机床上安排一个“不领原材料工作日”。这样，车间里加工剩下的“料头”就都可以重新加工成质量良好的成品。“不领原材料工作日”的另一个原材料来源，是工人在车间外面拣回来的破铜碎铁。
    七月十三日是这个车间的第一个“不领原材料工作日”。到八月二十二日，他们已经安排了十九个“不领原材料工作日”，共为国家节约了价值三百八十一元二角八分钱的原材料。
    工人们每一天都一点一滴地想办法节约原材料。不少工人在机床旁预备了一个小木箱，节约下来的一点点“料头”，也都放在木箱里。张庆贵在切割“顶触柱”的原料时，节约了不少“料头”，现在他已经把这些“料头”加工成“接线头”。张德久一个人就在外面拣回来总长约十四五公尺的钢料。过去，在这个车间清扫时，“料头”、铁块到处都有，现在已经看不到了。
