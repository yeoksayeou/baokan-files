Xinhua News Agency, 13th September - The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its twenty-first meeting on September 13th.

The meeting, based on the State Council's proposal and Deputy Premier Chen Yi's explanation, discussed the issue of establishing the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and abolishing Xinjiang Province. The meeting considered that after a relatively long period of consultation and preparation by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province, preparations for the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region were ready. At the same time, of the more than four million people in Xinjiang Province, the Uyghur ethnic group accounts for more than 74 percent, and the establishment of an autonomous region with the Uyghur ethnic group as the main body is in line with the state's ethnic policies. The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government has submitted a report to the State Council requesting approval for the early establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Therefore, the meeting passed a resolution: approving the proposal submitted by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council to establish the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, abolish the Xinjiang Province system, and use the original administrative region of Xinjiang Province as the administrative region of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

The meeting also approved appointments.

    全国人民代表大会常委会会议通过决议
    成立新疆维吾尔自治区撤销新疆省建制
    新华社十三日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会在九月十三日举行第二十一次会议。
    会议根据国务院提出的议案和陈毅副总理的说明，讨论了成立新疆维吾尔自治区撤销新疆省建制的问题。会议考虑到经过新疆省各民族人民的较长时间的协商和准备，建立新疆维吾尔自治区的筹备工作已经就绪。同时，新疆省四百多万人口中，维吾尔族占百分之七十四以上，以维吾尔族为主体成立自治区是符合国家的民族政策的。新疆省人民政府已向国务院提出报告，提请批准早日建立新疆维吾尔自治区。因此，会议通过决议：批准国务院周恩来总理提出的议案，成立新疆维吾尔自治区，撤销新疆省建制，并以原新疆省的行政区域为新疆维吾尔自治区的行政区域。
    会议还通过了任命事项。
