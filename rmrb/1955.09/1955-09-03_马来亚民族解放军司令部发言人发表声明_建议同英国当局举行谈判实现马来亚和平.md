Xinhua News Agency, London, September 2nd: The British "Labour Monthly" published a statement by the spokesperson of the Malayan National Liberation Army Headquarters to the British authorities, which suggests holding negotiations to achieve peace in Malaya.

The statement said that the sole objective of our struggle was and still is to establish a peaceful, democratic, and independent Malaya. We have always strived to achieve this goal peacefully, believing that this is beneficial not only to the people of Malaya, but also to the people and government of Britain.

However, the British government continues to maintain colonial rule in Malaya. Currently, Britain is forcing Malaya to accept a constitution that does not conform to the principles of self-determination and the wishes of the people. The British Governor of Singapore and the British High Commissioner to the Federation of Malaya still enjoy the power to veto any resolutions passed by the Legislative Council. Foreign troops are still stationed in Malaya, and these troops can establish their own military bases on Malayan soil.

As long as this situation exists, Malaya cannot be said to have achieved independence or any true freedom. On the contrary, this situation threatens the freedom and democratic rights of the Malayan people, who do not intend to bear sacrifices for purposes that violate their own interests.

The statement continued, in order to truly realize the national independence of Malaya, it is first necessary to end the war, revoke the emergency regulations, and guarantee the freedom and democratic rights of the people. Only under these conditions can national elections be held in a peaceful and democratic environment.

We firmly believe that it is possible and necessary for various political parties, associations, and social organizations representing the people to convene a round table conference in the shortest possible time in order to comprehensively discuss the issue of ceasefire and to guarantee national independence through peaceful means. Reaching an agreement on this basis will be in the vital interests of all the people of Malaya. If such a conference can be convened, we will actively promote its success.

The statement said that the "amnesty" proposal as a means of ceasefire is not a completely satisfactory proposal. However, in order to express the sincere desire for peace and to promote a speedy ceasefire, the Headquarters of the Malayan National Liberation Army is willing to make concessions and is prepared to accept this proposal as a basis for negotiations with the British government.

The statement said, however, it must be emphasized that any attempt to force us to surrender and submit is a breach of faith and is doomed to failure.

The fact is that the British authorities have taken all measures to try to crush us, and they have been doing so for almost seven years. But they have not succeeded. We have the support of the vast majority of the residents of our country. We will not be defeated. We believe that the overall situation is increasingly favorable to the cause of Malayan independence.

The statement concluded by saying that we are prepared to send our representatives to Kuala Lumpur to discuss preparatory measures for negotiations, provided that the British authorities provide all necessary guarantees to ensure the personal safety and freedom of our representatives. For the sake of peace, we have taken a big step forward. Now, whether the proposal to hold negotiations can be realized depends on the British authorities.

    马来亚民族解放军司令部发言人发表声明
    建议同英国当局举行谈判实现马来亚和平
    新华社二日讯　塔斯社伦敦一日讯：英国“劳动月刊”刊载了马来亚民族解放军司令部发言人对英国当局提出的声明，这个声明建议就实现马来亚和平举行谈判。
    声明说，我们斗争的唯一目标从前是，现在仍旧是建立和平、民主和独立的马来亚。我们始终力求以和平方式达到这个目标，我们认为，这样不仅有利于马来亚人民，而且有利于英国人民和政府。
    但是，英国政府继续在马来亚保持着殖民统治。目前，英国强迫马来亚接受不符合自决原则和人民愿望的宪法。英国驻新加坡总督和英国驻马来亚联合邦高级专员依旧享有否决立法议会所通过的任何决议的权力。在马来亚，仍旧驻扎着外国军队，这些军队能在马来亚土地上建立他们自己的军事基地。
    只要这种情况存在一天，马来亚就谈不上取得独立，或是任何真正的自由，相反地，这种情况威胁到马来亚人民的自由和民主权利，而马来亚人民是不打算为违反本身利益的目的而承担牺牲的。
    声明接着说，为了真正实现马来亚的民族独立，首先必须结束战争、撤销紧急条例和保障人民的自由和民主权利。只有在这些条件之下，全国选举才能够在和平和民主的环境中举行。
    我们深信，各个政党、协会和代表人民的社会团体有可能而且有必要在最短期间内召开圆桌会议，以便全面讨论停战问题和通过和平方式保障民族独立的问题。在这一基础上取得协议将符合马来亚全体人民的切身利益。如果这种会议能够召开，我们将积极促使会议获得成就。
    声明说，作为停战手段的“大赦”建议并不是完全令人满意的建议。但是，为了表示争取和平的真诚愿望和促使从速停战，马来亚民族解放军司令部愿意让步，并且准备接受这一建议作为同英国政府谈判的基础。
    声明中说，但是必须强调指出，要使我们投降屈服的任何企图都是对信用的破坏，都是注定要失败的。
    实际情况是英国当局采取了一切办法想来粉碎我们，他们这样作已经快七年了。但是他们并没有成功。我们得到我国绝大多数居民的支持。我们是不会被战胜的。我们相信，总的局势对马来亚取得独立的事业越来越是有利的。
    声明最后说，我们准备派我们的代表到吉隆坡去讨论进行谈判的准备措施，只要英国当局提供一切必要的保证，来保障我们代表的人身安全和自由。为了和平着想，我们已向前走了一大步。现在，关于举行谈判的建议是否能实现，就要看英国当局了。
