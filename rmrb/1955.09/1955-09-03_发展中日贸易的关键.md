The development of equal and mutually beneficial trade between China and Japan is of great benefit to the development and improvement of the national economies of both countries, and it is also a common aspiration of the people of China and Japan. In recent years, thanks to the continuous efforts of our government and people, as well as people from all walks of life in Japan who are enthusiastic about Sino-Japanese trade, Sino-Japanese trade has recovered to a certain extent, but it is far from fully utilizing the possibilities of trade between the two countries, let alone achieving the development it deserves. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the "September 3rd" victory, it is beneficial to review the situation and process of Sino-Japanese trade since the founding of New China in order to find out the key to the development of Sino-Japanese trade for the future development of Sino-Japanese trade.

The process of recovery and development of Sino-Japanese trade in the past six years has been tortuous. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, trade between China and Japan had recovered to a considerable extent. According to statistics, the volume of Sino-Japanese trade in 1950 increased by 2.2 times compared with 1949. People were expecting this trade to continue to develop, but since 1951, due to the Japanese government's pursuit of the trade discriminatory "embargo" policy of the United States, trade between China and Japan was on the verge of being interrupted, and the trade volume in 1952 was only a quarter of that in 1950. This situation is clearly contrary to the interests of the Japanese people. In June 1952, after the Moscow International Economic Conference, representatives of China and Japan signed the first Sino-Japanese trade agreement in Beijing. This agreement was significant as the beginning of the restoration of trade relations between the two countries, but the result of its implementation was only about 5% of the total trade volume of 60 million pounds stipulated in the agreement, which was far from satisfactory. In October 1953, we signed the second Sino-Japanese trade agreement in Beijing with a delegation from the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade. The result of the implementation of this agreement was 38.8% of the total agreement amount of 60 million pounds. Although it was a step forward compared with the first time, it was still not satisfactory; at the same time, it must be pointed out that the percentage of China's exports to Japan completed in the implementation of the agreement was more than twice that of Japan's exports to China. This was not because Japan did not have export commodities to China, but because the Japanese government restricted the export of Japanese commodities to China.

In order to further develop Sino-Japanese trade relations, in March this year, we sent a trade delegation composed of representatives from trade, banking, shipping and other aspects to visit Japan. The delegation had extensive contacts with Japanese business and people from all walks of life, enhanced mutual understanding, and signed the third Sino-Japanese trade agreement in Tokyo. The people of China and Japan are watching the implementation of this agreement, hoping that it can be successfully implemented and that Sino-Japanese trade relations will be further developed.

China and Japan have full conditions for developing trade. The economic exchanges between the two countries have had close relations in history and have occupied an important position in the economic life of the people of China and Japan. China's soybeans, rice and other grains, oilseeds, and industrial raw materials such as salt, coal, and iron sand are needed by Japan, and have been supplied to Japan in large quantities in the past. These commodities play an important role in the lives of the Japanese people and the normal development of Japanese peaceful industries. Commodities such as steel, hardware, ships, power generation equipment, chemical raw materials, fertilizers, medicines, dyes, and rayon produced in Japan are needed by China and are also required by Japan for foreign markets. China and Japan are geographically close, and it only takes two days by sea from Shanghai to Nagasaki; it only takes four days from Tianjin to Kobe, and transportation is extremely convenient. The freight for one ton of coal is about 17 US dollars from the United States to Japan, and only about 3 US dollars from China to Japan. It can be seen that if China and Japan can freely exchange what they have on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, according to the needs and possibilities of both parties, Sino-Japanese trade clearly has extremely broad prospects.

China and Japan have many favorable conditions for developing trade, but so far, it has not been developed as it should be. What is the key? The key is that Sino-Japanese trade relations have not yet been normalized. And the responsibility lies with the Japanese government. The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always advocated developing extensive trade relations with Japan in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and have taken measures to improve trade relations between the two countries, but the Japanese government has so far adopted a negative attitude and is unwilling to assume the responsibilities and obligations it should bear, so that Sino-Japanese trade relations have not been normalized.

The signing of trade agreements between the governments of the two countries is an important condition for the development of international trade relations. Therefore, although three non-governmental trade agreements have been signed between China and Japan, as mentioned above, the first two trade agreements have not been successfully implemented due to the lack of support from the Japanese government, and whether the third trade agreement can be successfully implemented depends on the Japanese government. If the Japanese government changes its attitude towards Sino-Japanese trade, gives real support and assistance to the newly signed trade agreement, and further discusses and signs trade agreements between the two governments, trade between China and Japan will be greatly developed. This is beneficial to the economic development of China and Japan, especially to the improvement of the Japanese economy. Japan's economy relies heavily on foreign trade. Because Japan needs to import many kinds of industrial raw materials from abroad, and industrial products need foreign sales markets, if the governments of China and Japan sign a trade agreement, Sino-Japanese trade relations will be normalized, Sino-Japanese trade will inevitably expand, and Japan's various products will get a large and stable sales market, and at the same time, it will get a full supply of various products needed by Japan.

The conclusion of payment agreements between the national banks of both sides, the realization of mutual opening of accounts, and the direct handling of all payment and settlement matters related to Sino-Japanese trade and trade can eliminate the inconvenience of the current third-country banks and improve the current complicated management methods for Japan's import and export trade with China, which is extremely beneficial to the development of Sino-Japanese trade. We have made many efforts for this, and the Japanese business community also believes that it should be realized as soon as possible, and it has been included in the third Sino-Japanese trade agreement, but due to the Japanese government's negative attitude, there has been no progress so far, which has greatly hindered the convenience and development of trade between the two countries.

The mutual establishment of permanent business representative offices with powers and effectiveness in each other's countries can promptly understand each other's supply and demand, promptly resolve trade-related issues between the two parties, and closely connect each other. The establishment of such institutions is undoubtedly important for the development of trade relations between the two countries. Representatives from both China and Japan also believed when negotiating trade agreements that they should be set up as soon as possible for the development of Sino-Japanese trade. It is also because of the obstruction of the Japanese government that it has not been realized so far. Recently, China's trade negotiations with Egypt have reached a specific agreement on the mutual establishment of business representative offices between China and Egypt. This fully shows that the governments of China and Egypt have the sincerity to develop trade between the two countries, which is a clear contrast to the Japanese government.

Abolishing the trade discriminatory "embargo" policy is an important condition for the development of Sino-Japanese trade. Because the Japanese government implemented the US embargo policy, the originally huge Sino-Japanese trade was artificially reduced to a very small amount, making Japan's independent economy subordinate to the United States and bringing serious difficulties to the Japanese economy, which is completely contrary to the interests of the Japanese people. For China, the "embargo" did not suffocate the Chinese economy. China's rapid recovery and the first five-year economic construction plan currently underway are enough to illustrate this. And it is Japan itself that has suffered the actual disaster of the "embargo." Therefore, the Japanese people and business community are justified in demanding the abolition of the "embargo." Only by completely abolishing the "embargo" policy and freely exchanging the commodities of the two countries according to needs and possibilities can Sino-Japanese trade be further developed.

Establishing normal trade relations between China and Japan, first signing a trade agreement between the two governments, signing a payment agreement between the national banks of the two countries, mutually establishing business representative offices, and abolishing the "embargo" policy on trade are the key to the current development of Sino-Japanese trade. These problems are completely possible to solve, can be solved, and should be solved. The main thing is to see the attitude of the Japanese government. It has been ten years since the end of World War II, and normal relations between China and Japan have not yet been restored, and trade relations have not been normally developed, which is completely contrary to the wishes of the Japanese people. After the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the international situation has eased somewhat. The Japanese government should change its attitude of obstructing Sino-Japanese trade, give positive support to Sino-Japanese trade, and take concrete measures to normalize trade relations between the two countries, and trade between China and Japan will be further developed.

    发展中日贸易的关键
    中华人民共和国对外贸易部副部长  雷任民
    发展中日两国间平等互利的贸易，对两国国民经济的发展和改善有很大好处，也是中日两国人民的共同愿望。几年来，在我国政府和人民以及日本热心于中日贸易的各界人士的不断努力下，中日贸易虽有了一定的恢复，但还远远没有使两国贸易的可能被充分利用，更未能得到应有的发展。在“九·三”十周年纪念日的今天，对新中国成立以来中日贸易的情况和过程做一回顾，从而找出发展中日贸易的关键所在，对今后中日贸易的开展是有益的。
    六年来中日贸易的恢复和发展的过程是曲折的。中华人民共和国成立后，中、日两国贸易曾有相当程度的恢复。根据统计资料，一九五○年中日贸易额即比一九四九年增加了二点二倍。人们正在期待这种贸易能够继续发展，但自一九五一年开始，由于日本政府追随美国执行了贸易歧视的“禁运”政策，使中日两国间的贸易濒于中断，一九五二年的贸易额仅及一九五○年的四分之一。这一情况显然是违背日本人民利益的。一九五二年六月，在莫斯科国际经济会议以后，中日双方代表在北京签订了第一次中日贸易协议。这个协议作为恢复两国贸易关系的开端是有意义的，但是执行的结果仅实现了协议规定的贸易总额六千万英镑的百分之五左右，远远不能令人满意。一九五三年十月我们又和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团在北京签订了第二次中日贸易协议，这次协议执行的结果实现了协议总额六千万英镑的百分之三十八点八。虽然比第一次进了一步，但是还不能令人满意；同时必须指出，协议执行中中国对日本的出口完成的百分比超过日本对中国的出口一倍左右，这并不是因为日本没有出口商品对中国输出，而是因为日本政府限制了日本商品向中国输出的结果。
    为了进一步发展中日贸易关系，今年三月间，我们派出了一个由贸易、银行、航运等各方面代表组成的贸易代表团去日本访问。代表团在日本同日本工商界和各界人士进行了广泛的接触，增进了相互间的了解，并在东京签订了第三次中日贸易协定。中、日两国人民正注视着这个协定的执行，希望它能够圆满地实现，使中日贸易关系获得进一步发展。
    中日两国间具备着发展贸易的充分条件。两国的经济交流在历史上曾有过密切关系，在中、日两国人民经济生活中曾占着重要的位置。中国的大豆、大米等粮食、油料和盐、煤、铁砂等工业原料是日本所需要的，在过去曾经大量供应过日本，这些商品对日本人民的生活和日本和平工业的正常发展有着重要作用。日本生产的钢铁、五金、轮船、发电设备、化工原料、肥田料、药品、染料、人造丝等商品是中国所需要的，也是日本要求国外市场的。中日两国地理邻近，从上海到长崎仅需两天的海程；从天津到神户仅需四天时间，运输极为近便。一吨煤的运费，从美国到日本约需十七美元，从中国到日本仅为三美元左右。由此可见，如果中日两国能够在平等互利的基础上，按照双方的需要和可能，自由地互通有无，中日贸易显然有着极为广阔的前途。
    中日两国具备着发展贸易的多种便利条件，但迄今为止，仍未得到应有的发展，其关键何在呢？关键在于中日贸易关系尚未正常化。而其责任在于日本政府。中国政府和中国人民一贯主张同日本按照平等互利的原则发展广泛的贸易关系，并曾采取措施，改进两国贸易关系，但是日本政府至今仍采取消极态度，不愿承担起应负的责任和义务，使中日贸易关系未能正常化。
    两国政府间签订贸易协定是发展国际贸易关系的重要条件。所以中日两国间民间性的贸易协定虽已签订过三次，如前所述，由于日本政府未予支持，使前两次贸易协议都未能顺利执行，第三次贸易协定能否圆满实现，要看日本政府。如果日本政府改变其对中日贸易的态度，对新签订的贸易协定给予确实的支持和协助，并进而商谈和签订两国政府间的贸易协定，则中日两国间的贸易将会大大发展。这对中日两国经济的发展，特别是对日本经济的改善是有利的。日本的经济在很大程度上依靠对外贸易，因为日本有很多种的工业原料需由国外进口，同时工业产品又需要国外的销售市场，如果中日两国政府签订了贸易协定，中日贸易关系正常化，中日贸易必将扩大，日本的各种产品将会得到广大而稳定的销售市场，同时也会得到日本所需的各种产品的充分供应。
    双方国家银行缔结支付协定，实现相互开立账户，直接办理中日贸易以及同贸易有关的一切支付清算事宜，可以免除目前通过第三国银行的不便和改善目前日本方面对中国进出口贸易的繁琐管理办法，这对于中日贸易的发展是极其有利的。我们曾为此做过很多努力，日本工商界也认为应侭早实现，并且已经列入第三次中日贸易协定，但是由于日本政府的消极态度至今尚未有进展，这就大大妨碍了两国贸易的便利和开展。
    双方在对方国家互设有权力和有效的常驻商务代表机构，可以及时地相互了解彼此供应和需要的情况，及时解决双方有关贸易的问题和密切彼此间的联系，这种机构的设置，对于发展两国间的贸易关系，无疑是有重要作用的。中日双方代表在谈判贸易协定时也都认为，为中日贸易的开展，应侭速设置。也是因为日本政府的阻挠，至今未能实现。最近中国同埃及的贸易谈判，已经达成中埃两国之间相互设置商务代表机构的具体协议。这充分说明了中埃两国政府具有发展两国间贸易的诚意，这对于日本政府是个显明的对照。
    废除贸易歧视的“禁运”政策，是中日贸易发展的重要条件。由于日本政府执行了美国的禁运政策，使本来有着巨额的中日贸易，人为地缩小到很小的数额，使日本的独立经济变为服从于美国的从属地位，给日本经济带来了严重困难，这是完全违反日本人民的利益的。对于中国来说，“禁运”并未使中国经济窒息，中国经济的迅速恢复和现在正在进行的第一个五年经济建设计划就足以说明。而受到“禁运”的实际灾难的，正是日本自己。因此，日本人民和工商界热烈要求废除“禁运”是有理由的，只有彻底废除“禁运”政策，根据需要和可能，自由地互相交换两国的商品，中日贸易才能进一步发展。
    建立中日两国间的正常贸易关系，首先签订两国政府间的贸易协定，签订两国国家银行间的支付协定，互设商务代表机构，废除贸易上的“禁运”政策是目前发展中日贸易的关键所在。这些问题是完全有可能解决的、能够解决的、应该解决的。主要是看日本政府的态度如何。第二次世界大战结束已经十年了，中日两国间的正常关系尚未恢复，贸易关系尚未得到正常发展，这是完全违反日本人民的意愿的。在日内瓦四大国首脑会议以后，国际局势已有些缓和，日本政府亟应改变阻挠中日贸易的态度，对中日贸易给以积极支持，为两国贸易关系正常化做出具体措施，则中日两国的贸易，将会得到进一步的发展。
