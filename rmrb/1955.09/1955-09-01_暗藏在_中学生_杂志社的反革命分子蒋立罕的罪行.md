The Crimes of Chiang Li-han, a Counter-Revolutionary Hidden in the "Middle School Student" Magazine
"Middle School Student" Magazine

In July of this year, a strange incident occurred at the "Middle School Student" magazine: Meng Chuan-bin, a student from Tianjin No. 3 Middle School, after reading the article "Making Soda" published in the July issue of "Middle School Student," followed the method to make soda. As a result, the soda bottle exploded, injuring both his hands and chest. Readers from other places also reported that not only could they not make soda using this method, but the bottles also exploded. After investigation, it was proven that this incident was a vicious conspiracy by Chiang Li-han, a counter-revolutionary hidden in the "Middle School Student" magazine.

	A Person with a Special Background
Chiang Li-han was a sworn enemy of progressive youth long ago. Before liberation, when he was studying at the Agricultural College of Peking University, he joined the Kuomintang and served as the secretary of the Kuomintang district branch. He received a monthly allowance from the Kuomintang Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters. According to his own confession, he received even more allowance when student movements occurred. This means that he was very active in undermining student movements. He once reported the situation at the school to the Second Department of the "North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters," saying, "The Communist Party is very active and we must think of a way quickly." Chen Xueping, the big Kuomintang secret agent, also invited him to his home for dinner to "discuss work." He also frequently provided blacklists to the pseudo-Peiping Municipal Party Headquarters to arrest progressive students. In 1947, when students launched the "Anti-Civil War, Anti-Hunger" movement, he gathered his henchmen at home to plan activities to sabotage the student movement. He removed the valve stems from the tires of the Peking University Agricultural College's cars, preventing students from taking cars to the city to participate in the parade. In his current dormitory, iron bars and cowhide whips he used to beat people during that time were also found. On the eve of liberation, a big shot of the Central Bureau of Statistics secret service in Beijing summoned him and said, "I am going to Taiwan. You stay behind..." So he remained in hiding for a long time.

After liberation, Chiang Li-han, in the face of the strict laws of our people's government, pretended to bow his head and confess his crimes, accepting supervision. He seemed to be "well-behaved" on the surface, but secretly wrote secret letters to his "friends," saying, "We must endure and prepare to meet even greater misfortune." He often secretly met with other counter-revolutionaries, and even "exchanged New Year greetings" during the Spring Festival, discussing some "small business." In a secret letter, he revealed such a conspiracy: "We must break a gap and formulate a newer plan."

	Sneaking into the Belly
Like all hidden counter-revolutionaries, Chiang Li-han also used despicable two-faced tactics to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, waiting for an opportunity to carry out sabotage activities.

After pretending to plead guilty and receiving lenient treatment from the People's Government, he joined the Kaiming Bookstore and later sneaked into the "Middle School Student" magazine. He told everyone, "I have stains on my past history, and I am sorry to the people. In the future, I will serve the people well and atone for my sins. I will also study hard and improve my understanding." He appeared very "sincere" when he said this; although he was not very energetic at work, he seemed "diligent" and very "cautious"; in front of the leaders, he was always respectful and spoke softly; he was also "polite" and "very courteous" to ordinary comrades.

Under these pretenses of being "active" and "honest," Chiang Li-han gradually launched his counter-revolutionary activities.

He often made strange remarks and complained in front of backward comrades. For example, he would say, "The League members in the magazine do not approach the masses," "The leadership is not democratic, they only listen to the opinions of the big radishes (referring to group leaders), and ignore the opinions of us little radishes (referring to ordinary comrades)," "Leader XX is arrogant," and incite the masses' dissatisfaction with the Party. Because everyone was temporarily deceived by his false appearance, they did not suspect his ulterior motives.

	Accidents Occur One After Another
Chiang Li-han was responsible for editing natural science knowledge at "Middle School Student." When revising science knowledge manuscripts, he often deliberately made important and simple numbers and methods wrong in order to achieve his vicious goal of poisoning young people. For example, in the September 1954 issue of "Middle School Student," an article titled "How to Protect Your Eyes" was published. The original manuscript mentioned that a positive way to prevent nearsightedness was to "not read for more than one hour. After reading, you should go outdoors for some activity and look at distant places to give your eyes a rest." Chiang Li-han deliberately deleted this very important passage.

Another time, when the Party called on students to plant sunflowers to increase oilseed crops, "Middle School Student" magazine published an article guiding the planting of sunflowers in its March issue this year. The original article did not discuss the method of seed selection, but Chiang Li-han deliberately introduced a wrong method - the water selection method, and explained that the seeds that sank to the bottom of the water must be good seeds. In fact, he knew that sunflower seeds are different from ordinary seeds and cannot be selected by the water selection method at all. They can only be selected one by one; if the water selection method is used, good seeds will not sink, and bad seeds will sink. The "Middle School Student" readers planted seeds according to the seed selection method written by Chiang Li-han, and the planted seeds were all bad, thus destroying the planting activities and affecting sunflower production.

Chiang Li-han used every possible loophole to slander the new China. In an article titled "What are the Uses of Wood?" Chiang Li-han intentionally overstated the amount of pit props used by my country's coal mines throughout the year by a hundred times. He used this method to slander that the new China's coal mining industry was extremely backward.

In a short article of less than 300 words introducing "Making Vein Bookmarks," he also "creatively" made many deletions and revisions, deliberately changing the leaves used for making leaf veins, the dosage of medicines, the cooking time, and the method of removing the leaf flesh, so that no one could make vein bookmarks.

This hidden counter-revolutionary tried every possible means to undermine the youth's enthusiasm for scientific activities and undermine the Party's cause of cultivating and educating a new generation.

	How Did the Soda Bottle Explode?
In the movement to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries, this heinous counter-revolutionary did not bow his head and confess his crimes. In front of people, he pretended to be "indifferent," hypocritically saying, "I have confessed my problems clearly, and I feel relieved." Behind his back, he carried out sabotage activities even more frantically.

In the July issue of "Middle School Student" magazine, in order to promote comprehensive technical education, guide young students to love science, and enrich students' summer vacation life, a simple and easy scientific method for making soda was specially introduced; but the counter-revolutionary Chiang Li-han viciously tampered with the author's original manuscript when processing the manuscript.

First of all, he changed the dosage of the two medicines used in the original manuscript for making soda: Tartaric acid was originally "three and a half grams," but he changed it to "one tael," and baking soda was "four grams," but he changed it to "one tael and two mace." According to the dosage, it was almost increased by ten times.

Ten times! Ten times the amount of chemical medicine, packed in small bottles, their chemical reaction is equivalent to a small bomb.

At the same time, he also changed the bottles used for making soda: the original "beer bottle" was changed to "narrow-mouth bottle." Beer bottles have a large capacity and thick walls, which can withstand the pressure of soda; narrow-mouth bottles are ordinary medicine bottles with thin walls and small capacity, and cannot withstand the pressure of soda. The dosage of medicine has been increased by ten times, which is already very dangerous, and the bottle has also been changed to smaller and thinner, which makes it easier to explode and explode more violently. When we sent someone to Tianjin to visit student Meng Chuan-bin, we learned that the two medicines he used when making soda were less than one-third of a tael, and it exploded.

Not only that, but in order to make his premeditated murder plan succeed, the counter-revolutionary also carried out the following series of conspiracies:

According to the regulations of our magazine, the author's original manuscript should be attached when submitting the manuscript for review. This counter-revolutionary, who usually pretends to be very "law-abiding," did not attach the original manuscript for review this time. When submitting it for review, he repeatedly emphasized to the leaders that the author was from "Children's Home," and they had made soda last summer vacation and had great results, so there would be no problems. He only smoothed out the wording of this article. This was to paralyze the leaders and comrades, so the leaders failed to discover this mistake in time.

Shortly after the publication of the July issue of "Middle School Student," the students in Beijing made soda according to the method introduced in the publication, but none of them succeeded. It was either "so sour that it hurt their teeth" or "so astringent that they wanted to vomit after drinking it"; they called to ask, but Chiang Li-han told them very positively on the phone: "The medicines are good, you should do it a few more times!" When one student poured tartaric acid solution into the bottle (he used a beer bottle because there were no other "narrow-mouth bottles"), the soda immediately broke open the bottle stopper and shot up three or four feet high. When he called to ask, Chiang Li-han answered even more "ingeniously," saying, "I'm afraid your bottle stopper was not tightened. If the bottle stopper is tightened, it will not come out."

On the 16th and 17th, readers from other places also wrote one after another, reflecting that they could not make soda successfully. They also asked how much soda can be made with these many medicines, how big the bottle should be, and how much water should be added, etc. Chiang Li-han replied vaguely to the readers, only saying that it would not be wrong to do it according to the method in our publication; on the 23rd (one week before Meng Chuan-bin wrote to report the explosion and injury), a reader wrote to report that making soda had broken the bottle (fortunately no one was injured). He did not answer this letter at all, and secretly hid the letter on the pretext of "taking it home to deal with." After the matter was discovered, we asked him to hand it over, but he destroyed the letter along with other counter-revolutionary evidence.

All this proves that the explosion and injury accident of "making soda" was a pre-planned assassination activity by the counter-revolutionary Chiang Li-han.

	Cannot Slip Away
After we seized all these evidences of his sabotage conspiracy, the counter-revolutionary Chiang Li-han still tried his best to quibble and tried to muddle through. He said that the dosage of medicine for "making soda" was a mistake in calculating one decimal place when he converted "grams" to "taels." He always refused to admit that it was intentional sabotage. In order to expose his evil conspiracy, we gave him a piece of chalk at the meeting and asked him to write the calculation formula of how to convert "grams" to "taels" on the blackboard for everyone to see. He "hesitated" for half an hour, sometimes dividing "grams" by "taels," and sometimes dividing "taels" by "grams"; sometimes adding a "0" under "taels," and sometimes moving the decimal point of the quotient up and down one place. But no matter how he calculated, he never even calculated the absolute numbers of "one" and "1.2." Because his so-called "one tael" and "one tael and two mace" were completely fabricated out of thin air!

We also asked him why he wanted to convert "grams" to "taels," and he quibbled that he did it for the convenience of the students because there were no balances in the countryside. We further exposed his lies.

We asked: Do you know whether tartaric acid and baking soda are Western medicine or Chinese medicine?

He replied: Western medicine.

We asked: Is Western medicine weighed with a balance or with a scale?

He replied: Weighed with a balance.

We asked: Is the balance calculated in "grams" or in "taels" and "mace"?

He replied: In "grams."

We asked: Then why do you want to convert "grams" to "taels"?

He could not answer. Because he could not justify himself at all.

When he was questioned, he tried his best to say that he was "low in level" and "careless," trying to say that these deliberately created political accidents were accidents of responsibility. But the fact is that Chiang Li-han graduated from the Agricultural College of Peking University and was a middle school physics and chemistry teacher. He has certain agricultural and physical and chemical knowledge. Simple numbers and common sense in articles such as "Making Soda," "Making Vein Bookmarks," "What are the Uses of Wood?" and "How to Grow Sunflowers Well" would never be wrong. And more seriously, after Chiang Li-han carried out these sabotage activities, he also tried every means to deceive the leaders and conceal his crimes; all this can only show that Chiang Li-han was deliberately and systematically carrying out counter-revolutionary conspiracies.

For more than a month, after studying the "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," we have brightened our eyes. With the help of the Party's leadership and the masses of readers, we have finally exposed this poisonous snake that has been lurking in the revolutionary ranks for a long time. After fully grasping the materials of Chiang Li-han's counter-revolutionary activities, we repeatedly explained the Party's policies to him, asking him to thoroughly confess and start a new life. But this incorrigible counter-revolutionary stubbornly denied everything and resisted to the end, even destroying the evidence of counter-revolutionary crimes, indicating his determination to be an enemy of the people. The comrades of our "Middle School Student" magazine are very angry and unanimously request the leaders of the China Youth Publishing House to suggest that the People's Government severely punish him according to law. Not long ago, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate has依法 (yifa - according to law) arrested and brought to justice the counter-revolutionary Chiang Li-han.

This guilty counter-revolutionary finally did not escape the giant hand of the people.

    暗藏在“中学生”杂志社的反革命分子蒋立罕的罪行
    “中学生”杂志社
    今年七月间，“中学生”杂志社发生了一桩奇异的事故：天津第三中学的学生孟传斌，在看过“中学生”七月号上刊登的“做汽水”一文以后，仿照这个办法去制汽水，结果汽水瓶就发生爆炸，弄得两手和胸部都受了伤。其他地方的读者也反映用这个法子不但做不成汽水，反而炸破了瓶子。经检查的结果，证明这桩事故是一个暗藏在“中学生”杂志社的反革命分子蒋立罕的毒辣阴谋。
      别有来历的人
    蒋立罕很早就是进步青年的死对头。解放前在北京大学农学院念书的时候，他就加入了国民党，担任国民党区分部的书记。他每月向国民党北平市党部领取津贴，照他自己供认，学生运动一来，领的津贴就更多。这也就是说，他破坏学生运动是很积极的。他曾到“华北剿总”二处去汇报过学校的情况，说“共产党活动很厉害，得快想办法。”国民党的大特务头子陈雪屏也请他到家中去吃饭，借此“谈工作”。他也经常给伪北平市党部开黑名单，逮捕进步学生。一九四七年，学生们掀起“反内战反饥饿”运动时，他在家中召集他的喽啰们布置破坏学运的活动。他把北大农学院的汽车轮胎上的气门栓拔掉，阻碍同学们坐汽车到城里来参加游行。在他现在住的宿舍里，还发现那时他用来打人的铁棍和包着牛皮的鞭子，解放前夕，在北京的一个中统特务大头子又召见他，对他说：“我要跑到台湾去。你留下……”于是他就长期潜伏了下来。
    解放了，蒋立罕在我们人民政权森严的法纪面前，假装低头认罪，接受了管制。他表面上好像已经“规规矩矩”，其实暗地里却在给他“朋友”写密信说：“我们要忍受，要准备迎接更大的不幸。”他经常同别的反革命分子秘密约会、接头，在春节时还“互相拜年”，谈一些“小买卖”。他在一封密信透露了这样的阴谋：“我们要打出一个缺口来，制定更新的计划。”
    钻进肚子里来
    和一切暗藏的反革命分子一样，蒋立罕也用尽卑鄙的两面手法，打进革命队伍内部来了，伺机进行破坏活动。
    他在假装服罪，得到人民政府宽大处理以后，就混入开明书店工作，后来又钻进“中学生”杂志社工作。他逢人就表示：“我过去历史上有污点，对不起人民，今后要好好为人民服务，将功赎罪。我也要好好学习，提高觉悟。”说这话的时候，态度装得很“真诚”；他在工作上劲头虽然不大，看起来倒也是“勤勤恳恳”的，而且十分“小心谨慎”；在领导面前，他总是毕恭毕敬，讲起话来轻言细语；同一般同志相处，也“客客气气”，“很有礼貌”。
    就在这些“积极”、“老实”的伪装下，蒋立罕一步步地展开了他的反革命活动。
    他经常在落后同志们面前说怪话，发牢骚。譬如说“杂志社党团员不接近群众”啦，“领导上不民主，只听大萝卜头（指组长）的话，我们小萝卜头（指一般同志）的意见却充耳不闻”啦，“××领导盛气凌人”啦，挑拨群众对党的不满。由于大家一时被他的假象蒙蔽了，竟没有怀疑到他别有用心。
      事故层出不穷
    蒋立罕在“中学生”担任自然科学知识的编辑工作，在修改科学知识稿件时，经常把重要而简单的数字和制法故意搞错，来达到他毒害青年的恶毒目的。譬如在一九五四年九月号“中学生”上，发表了一篇“怎样爱护眼睛”的稿子。原稿中提到防止近视眼的积极办法是“看书不要超过一小时，看完书后，应当到室外活动一下，使眼睛看远处。”蒋立罕却故意把这很重要的一段删去了。
    又有一次，当党号召同学们种向日葵，以便增产油料作物的时候，“中学生”杂志在今年三月号刊登了一篇指导种植向日葵的文章。这篇文章原稿没有谈选种方法，蒋立罕却故意介绍了一种错误的选种方法——水选法，并说明沉到水底一定是好种子。其实他明知道，向日葵种子和一般种子不同，根本不能用水选法，只能一粒一粒的选；如果用水选法，好的种子根本不下沉，坏的种子倒下沉了。“中学生”读者按照蒋立罕所写的选种方法，种下去的种子都是坏的，这样就破坏了种植活动，影响了向日葵的增产。
    蒋立罕利用一切可钻的空子来污蔑新中国。在一篇“你知道木材有哪些用处？”一文中，蒋立罕有意把我国煤矿全年要用的坑木多算了一百倍。他用这样的办法来污蔑新中国采煤业是极端落后的。
    在一篇介绍“做叶脉书签”的不到三百字的短文中，他也“别出心裁”地大加删改，把做叶脉用的树叶、药品分量、煮的时间及去掉叶肉的方法都故意改错了，使得同学们没有一个人做得出叶脉书签。
    这个暗藏的反革命分子就是这样千方百计地来破坏青年对科学活动的积极性，破坏党培养教育新一代的事业。
    汽水瓶是怎样爆炸的
    在肃清一切反革命分子的运动中，这个罪恶多端的反革命分子，不低头认罪，在人面前，他装得“若无其事”，假惺惺地说：“我问题已交代清楚了，我感到一身轻。”在背后，却更加疯狂地进行破坏活动。
    在七月号的“中学生”杂志上，为了推行综合技术教育，引导青年同学热爱科学，丰富同学们的暑假生活，特地介绍了一个做汽水的简单而又易行的科学方法；但反革命分子蒋立罕在处理稿件时却故意把作者原稿加以恶毒的窜改。
    首先，他把原稿做汽水用的两种药品分量都改了：酒石酸原来是“三克半”，他改成了“一两”，小苏打“四克”，他改成了“一两二钱”。照分量算来，差不多增大了十倍。
    十倍！十倍的化学药品，装在小小的瓶子里，它们起化学作用的时候，就等于一个小炸弹。
    同时，他把做汽水用的瓶子也改了：原来的“啤酒瓶”，改成了“细口瓶”。啤酒瓶容量大、瓶壁厚，能抵挡汽水的压力；细口瓶即平常的药水瓶，瓶壁薄、容量小，不能抵抗汽水的压力。药品分量增大了十倍，已经很危险了，再加上瓶子又改小改薄了，这就更容易爆炸，爆炸得更猛烈。我们派人到天津去探望孟传斌同学时，知道孟传斌做汽水时用的两种药品，都还不到一两的三分之一，就爆炸了。
    不但这样，反革命分子为了使其预谋杀人的计划得逞，还作了下面一系列的阴谋活动：
    照我们杂志社的规定，送审稿件时要附上作者原稿，这个平时装得非常“奉公守法”的反革命分子，偏偏在这一次没有照规定把原稿附上送审。送审时，他还反复向领导上强调说，这个作者是“少年之家”的，他们去年暑假就做过汽水，很有成绩，不会有什么问题。这篇文章，他只在字句上顺一顺。以此来麻痹领导上和同志们，因此领导上未能及时发现这个错误。
    “中学生”七月号出版不久，北京市同学根据刊物上介绍的办法去制汽水，都没有制成功，不是“酸得要掉了牙”，就是“涩得一喝下去就要作呕”；他们打电话来问，蒋立罕在电话里却很肯定地告诉他们：“药品不错，你们多做几回吧！”有一位同学把酒石酸溶液倾入瓶里时（他用的是啤酒瓶，因为没有别的“细口瓶”），汽水一下子就冲开瓶塞，直冒三四尺高。他打电话来问时，蒋立罕回答得更“妙”，他说：“恐怕你的瓶塞没有塞紧。瓶塞塞紧，就冲不出来了。”
    到了十六、七日，外地读者也纷纷来信，都反映做汽水做不成功。还问，这许多药品能制多少汽水，瓶要多大，要放多少水，等等。蒋立罕给读者回信，都含糊其辞，只说照我们刊物上的做法不会错；二十三日（就是孟传斌来信反映爆炸伤人前一星期）有一位读者来信，反映做汽水炸破了瓶（幸未伤人）。这封信他根本就不回答，而且还以“带到家里去处理”的借口，把信悄悄藏起来了。事情被发现后，我们要他交出来，他却把这封信和其他反革命的罪证一起销毁了。
    所有这一切都证明了：“做汽水”发生爆炸伤人事故，是反革命分子蒋立罕事前周密布置的一个暗害活动。
      滑不过去
    当我们把他这些阴谋破坏的罪证都抓住了以后，反革命分子蒋立罕还百般狡辩，企图蒙混过关。他说“做汽水”的药品分量，是他把“克”换算成“两”的时候，算错了一位小数点。他始终不肯承认是故意破坏。为了揭穿他这个罪恶的阴谋，在开会时，我们给他一支粉笔，叫他到小黑板上，把“克”如何换算成“两”的算式列出给大家看。他“磨姑”了半个多钟头，一会儿把“克”去除“两”，一会儿又把“两”去除“克”；一会儿在“两”下面加个“0”，一会又把商数小数点移上、移下一位。但不论他怎样算，他始终连一个“一”和“一·二”的绝对数字也没有算出来。因为他所谓“一两”、“一两二钱”，完全是凭空捏造出来的！
    我们又问他为什么要把“克”化成“两”，他狡辩说，他是为同学们方便。因为乡下没有天平。我们就进一步揭穿他的鬼话。
    我们问：你知道酒石酸和小苏打是西药还是中药？
    他回答：是西药。
    我们问：西药是用天平称的，还是用秤称的？
    他回答：用天平称。
    我们问：天平是用“克”计算，还是用“两”、“钱”计算的？
    他回答：用“克”。
    我们问：那末你为什么要把“克”化成“两”？
    他答不上来了。因为他根本不能自圆其说。
    被问住了他又极力推说“水平低”、“疏忽大意”。企图把这些有意制造的政治事故说成是责任事故。但事实是：蒋立罕是北京大学农学院毕业的，曾任中学物理化学教员，具有一定的农业知识和物理化学知识。像“做汽水”、“做叶脉书签”、“木材有哪些用处”和“怎样种好向日葵”等文章中的简单数字和普通常识是决不会搞错的。而更严重的是蒋立罕在制造这些破坏活动以后，还想尽一切办法来欺骗领导，隐瞒他的罪行；这一切都只能说明蒋立罕是别有用心地、有计划地进行反革命阴谋活动的。
    一个多月来，经过了对“关于胡风反革命集团的材料”的学习，我们擦亮了眼睛，在党的领导和读者群众的帮助下，终于把这条长期潜伏在革命队伍内部的毒蛇揭露出来了。在充分掌握了蒋立罕的反革命活动材料以后，我们曾经反复对他交代党的政策，要他彻底坦白，重新做人。但这个怙恶不悛的反革命分子，却百般抵赖，顽抗到底，甚至销毁了反革命的罪证，表示要决心同人民为敌。我们“中学生”杂志社的同志们都非常愤怒，一致要求中国青年出版社领导上建议人民政府依法严厉惩办他。不久以前，北京市人民检察院已依法将反革命分子蒋立罕逮捕法办了。
    这个罪恶累累的反革命分子终于没有逃出人民的巨掌。
