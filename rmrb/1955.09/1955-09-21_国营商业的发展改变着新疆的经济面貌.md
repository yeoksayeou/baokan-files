    The Development of State-Owned Commerce Changes the Economic Landscape of Xinjiang
    Abudulin
    In Xinjiang, the overlapping snow-capped mountains thousands of meters above sea level and the endless deserts separate the rich agricultural areas, the vast grasslands, the production areas of various precious medicinal materials, and the emerging factory areas and cities. If you have not traveled through the vast Gobi Desert or trekked across the vast grasslands, it is difficult to appreciate the significance of carrying out trade work for the various ethnic groups scattered throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.
    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to stagnant trade, golden grains, cotton, and valuable native and special products such as fur in rural and pastoral areas were largely abandoned on the ground, while the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups lived in poverty. Occasionally, merchants would travel long distances to the grasslands, but they were not there to serve the herdsmen, but to plunder them. They could take a horse or a cow from the herdsmen for one or two top hats, and they would exchange a sheep with two teeth from the herdsmen for a little needle, thread, a few kilograms of dried apricots, peach skins, or even a flashlight and lighter worth only two or three yuan. They often came with only a package of goods, and when they returned, they all became "bosses" employing many people herding livestock.
    After liberation, the People's Government restored trade with the Soviet Union, developed urban and rural material exchanges, enlivened the market, cracked down on speculation, ensured supply, stabilized financial prices, and strengthened the socialist economic forces, which greatly changed the economic landscape of the entire Xinjiang. Taking pastoral areas as an example, herders can now buy daily necessities such as flour, tea, sugar, and leather boots at reasonable prices everywhere. Now, a sheep can be exchanged not just for a flashlight, but for a bolt of white cloth; men, women, and children all wear clothes made of printed cloth, corduroy, and even woolen fabrics. When you see this prosperous scene and hear people of all ethnic groups singing songs like "Take off the old sheepskin that has lasted for thousands of years, put on new clothes of fine cloth, thank the Chinese Communist Party, thank the leader Chairman Mao!" you can feel the intense excitement and agitation in people's hearts.
    In the six years since liberation, Xinjiang's state-owned trade institutions have continued to develop and grow. So far, the domestic trade system has successively established specialized companies such as department stores, cotton cloth, monopoly, oil, petroleum, medicine, cultural supplies, and mining areas; the foreign trade system has also established four specialized companies for animal products, tea, silk, and imports. By the end of 1954, the number of staff members in the state-owned commercial trade system had increased three and a half times compared with 1950, of which staff members from various minority ethnic groups accounted for 37.1 percent. Now, even those counties distributed along the edge of the vast Gobi Desert and in the mountains, which in the past rarely had commercial contacts with other places, have trade companies or trade stores. Coupled with supply and marketing cooperatives all over the place and hundreds of mobile trade teams simultaneously launching activities in the vast rural and pastoral areas, urban and rural trade is becoming increasingly active, changing the face of the entire Xinjiang national economy day by day.
    State-owned commercial trade institutions implement reasonable price policies in various places, purchasing large quantities of agricultural and pastoral people's native and special products, and supplying the production and living materials needed by farmers and herdsmen. Many of the native and special products purchased by the state were discarded as waste in the mountains and fields in the past, but now they have become the precious wealth of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups. In recent years, farmers and herdsmen have continuously improved and upgraded production technology, producing more and more products to sell to the state. The state's purchase volume has increased year by year, increasing 3.2 times in 1954 compared with 1950, and this year's purchase plan is even larger.
    The state is making every effort to meet the growing living needs of farmers and herdsmen. The supply of various commodities is also constantly increasing. For example, the sales volume of cloth in 1954 increased 6.3 times compared with 1950, and during the same period, the sales volume of tea increased 4.5 times. The prices of various native and special products have also greatly increased compared with before liberation, and are gradually becoming fair and reasonable. For example, in 1949, herdsmen could only exchange 8.3 bricks of tea for 100 sheepskins, but in 1952, 100 sheepskins could be exchanged for 55 bricks of tea. This has greatly promoted agricultural and pastoral production and improved the lives of people of all ethnic groups. For example, in the Bayingoleng Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture and the Bayinbuluke District of Hejing County, many herders in the past had nothing left even after working hard for many years, but now, every household on the grassland has livestock and everyone has something to do.
    A very favorable condition is that Xinjiang is close to the friendly Soviet Union, providing a broad export market for abundant livestock products and other native and special products. After the liberation of Xinjiang, the People's Government quickly restored trade relations with the Soviet Union. In recent years, it has exported a large number of draught animals, furs, casings, grains, oilseeds, dried fruits, and other native and special products in exchange for a large number of construction equipment and transportation tools, supporting Xinjiang and the country's economic construction. On the highways leading to the Soviet Union, you can see cars carrying furs and cars carrying brand-new tractors, combine harvesters, and other materials and equipment constantly coming and going. By 1954, the exported leather alone could be exchanged for the equipment of a power plant generating 20,000 kilowatts of electricity; sheepskin alone could be exchanged for steel rails for laying 5,000 kilometers of railways; and the wool exported in five years could be exchanged for 9,300 GAZ-150 trucks or 3,100 Stalin 80 tractors. The imported automobiles have increased the monthly transportation capacity of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Highway by 50,000 tons, greatly promoting the exchange of materials inside and outside Xinjiang and reducing prices. The imported tractors, if used for farming at the same time, can cultivate about 30,000 mu of land a day. In the desolate Gobi Desert of Xinjiang, modern industrial and mining enterprises and large-scale state-owned farms are being established, which is inseparable from the development of urban and rural material exchanges and trade with the Soviet Union. Now, the railway from Lanzhou via Urumqi to the Soviet Union is being rushed, and the future prospects for the development of Xinjiang's trade are truly encouraging. (Attached picture)
    
    On the basis of continuous development of production, the purchasing power of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang increased 7.2 times in 1954 compared with 1950. In order to meet the needs of people of all ethnic groups, state-owned commerce has also developed greatly.

    国营商业的发展改变着新疆的经济面貌
    阿布都林
    在新疆，重重叠叠的拔海数千公尺的雪山，连绵无垠的大大小小的沙漠，把富饶的农业区、一望无际的草原、各种名贵药材的产地以及蕴藏丰富的矿区和新兴的工厂区、城市分隔了开来。如果你没有穿行过浩瀚的戈壁，跋涉过广阔的草地，你是很难体会到开展贸易工作对于分散居住在天山南北各地的各族人民，具有着多么重大的意义。
    在国民党反动统治时期，由于贸易滞塞，农村、牧区黄金般的粮食、棉花以及皮毛等贵重的土产、特产，大量委弃于地，而勤劳勇敢的各族人民却过着穷困的生活。间或也有商人远途跋涉来到草原，但是他们不是来为牧民服务，而是来掠夺牧民的。他们拿一两顶礼帽可以牵去牧民的一匹马或一头牛，用一点针、线和几斤杏干、桃皮甚至只值两三块钱的一个手电筒、打火机，也要换牧民的一只二齿羊。他们常常是来时仅仅带着一包货物，回去时一个个都变成了雇有许多人吆着畜群的“老板”。
    解放后，人民政府恢复对苏联贸易，开展城乡物资交流，活跃市场，打击投机，保证供应，稳定金融物价，壮大社会主义经济的力量，使整个新疆的经济面貌起了巨大的变化。就以牧区来说，牧民们到处都可以用合理的价格，买到自己需要的面粉、茶、糖以及皮靴等日用品。现在用一只绵羊不再是只换回一个手电筒，而是可以换取一匹白市布了；男女老少都穿起了花布、条绒甚至毛织品的衣服。当你看到这种繁荣景象，听到各族人民唱起“脱去千年的老羊皮，穿上细布新衣裳，感谢中国共产党，感谢领袖毛主席！”这样的歌子时，你可以感到人们的心中充满着多么强烈的兴奋和激动。
    解放六年来，新疆的国营贸易机构不断发展和壮大。到目前为止，对内贸易系统已有百货、花纱布、专卖、油脂、石油、医药、文化用品、矿区等专业公司相继建立起来；对外贸易系统也已经建立了畜产、茶叶、丝绸、进口等四个专业公司。到一九五四年底，国营商业贸易系统的工作人员比一九五零年增加了三倍半，其中各少数民族工作人员占百分之三十七点一。现在，连那些分布在大戈壁边沿和万山丛中、过去很少同外地有商业往来的县份，也都有了贸易公司或贸易商店。加上遍布各地的供销合作社以及数百个流动贸易组在广阔的农村、牧区同时展开活动，就使得城乡贸易日益活跃起来，日新月异地改变着整个新疆国民经济的面貌。
    国营商业贸易机构，在各地执行着合理的价格政策，大量地收购农、牧民的土产、特产品，供应农民和牧民所需的生产、生活资料。国家收购的土特产品中，有很多过去是被当做废物遗弃山野的，现在则成了各族农民和牧民的宝贵财富。几年来农民和牧民不断改进和提高生产技术，增产越来越多的产品卖给国家。国家的收购量逐年增加，一九五四年比一九五零年增加了三点二倍，今年的收购计划规模更大。
    国家正在尽一切努力来满足农民和牧民日益增长的生活需要。各种商品的供应量也在不断增加。如布匹的销售量一九五四年比一九五零年增加了六点三倍，同时期内，茶的销售量增加了四倍半。各种土产、特产品的价格也较解放前有很大提高，正在逐步作到公平合理。如一九四九年，牧民用一百张羊皮只能换回砖茶八点三块，到一九五二年一百张羊皮就可以换到砖茶五十五块。这样就大大地推动了农业和牧业生产，改善了各族人民的生活。例如，在巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州和靖县巴音布鲁克区草原上，过去有很多牧民辛苦了多少年，连根牲畜毛也没有剩下，现在，草原上家家有牲畜，人人有事做。
      一个十分有利的条件是：新疆靠近友邦苏联，给产量丰富的各种畜产品和其他土产、特产提供了广阔的对外销路。新疆解放后，人民政府很快就恢复了同苏联的贸易关系。几年来曾出口了大批耕畜、皮毛、肠衣、粮食、油籽、干果等土产、特产品，换回了大批的建设器材和交通工具，支援了新疆和全国的经济建设。在通向苏联的公路干线上，你可以看到载着皮毛和载着崭新的拖拉机、联合收割机等物资器材的汽车不断地来往着。到一九五四年，单是出口的皮张就可换回发两万瓩电力的一座电厂设备，其中仅羊皮一项，即可换回铺设五千公里铁路的钢轨；五年中出口的羊毛可以换回吉斯一五○号载重汽车九千三百辆或斯大林八○号拖拉机三千一百台。进口的汽车已使兰新公路每月增加了五万吨的运输能力，大大地促进了新疆内外的物资交流，降低了物价。进口的拖拉机如同时用来耕地，一天约可耕地三万亩。新疆荒漠的戈壁滩上，一个个现代化的工矿企业和大规模的国营农场正在建立起来，这是同开展城乡物资交流和对苏贸易分不开的。现在，从兰州经乌鲁木齐到苏联境内的铁路正在赶修，展望新疆未来贸易事业的发展远景，实在令人欢欣鼓舞。（附图片）
    在不断发展生产的基础上，新疆各族人民的购买力一九五四年比一九五零年增加了七点二倍。为了适应各族人民的需要，国营商业也有很大发展。这是维吾尔族顾客在乌鲁木齐市中国百货公司第二门市部里选购花色绸缎。
