The state-owned Shandong Provincial Transportation Company plans to save more than 206,900 liters of gasoline and more than 15,600 liters of diesel in the second half of the year. To ensure the completion of this conservation plan, the Shandong Provincial Transportation Company is widely promoting advanced experiences such as "air fuel savers" and "towing empty trucks with empty trucks," strengthening vehicle maintenance, and has also formulated "winter vehicle maintenance measures." At present, more than 80% of the vehicles in the province have installed "air fuel savers," generally saving about 3 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers compared to before. The Jining Transportation Branch Company has implemented the method of "towing empty trucks with empty trucks," using ten-wheeled trucks to tow six-wheeled trucks, saving 5 liters of gasoline over 32 kilometers from Jining to Ziyang, which is nearly the consumption of one vehicle.

From the beginning of July to August 20th, state-owned transportation companies in Shandong Province have already saved 32,123 liters of gasoline and 2,639 liters of diesel. (Xu Zhigang)

    山东运输公司积极节约汽油
    国营山东省运输公司计划下半年节约汽油二十万六千九百多公升，柴油一万五千六百多公升。为了保证完成这项节约计划，山东省运输公司正在广泛推广“空气节油器”推行“空车拖空车”等先进经验，加强车辆保养，另外还制定了“冬季车辆保养措施”。目前，全省百分之八十以上的车辆都已经安装了“空气节油器”，一般每行驶一百公里比以前节约汽油三公升左右。济宁运输分公司推行“空车拖空车”的办法，用十轮汽车拖六轮汽车，从济宁到滋阳，三十二公里节省汽油五公升，将近一辆车的消耗量。
    从七月初到八月二十日，山东全省的国营运输公司已经节约汽油三万二千一百二十三公升，柴油二千六百三十九公升。　（许志岗）
