Make a Good Job of Food Rationing in Towns and Cities

    Housewives' Forum

    Twelve housewives from worker families living in the "Beiyang Workshop" courtyard in Tucheng, Sixth District of Tianjin, recently held a meaningful forum to discuss the benefits of planned grain consumption. Some of them were housewives who had always been thrifty, while others had not paid attention to saving food in the past.

    Auntie Liu was once a wasteful person when it came to food. In the past, she would steam two large steamer baskets full of steamed buns at a time, and if they dried out, she would throw them on the windowsill. When others asked her about it, she would say, "Oh, I'm saving them for making sauce." A pig farmer had prepared a large bucket in front of her house. Auntie Liu and other families would pour dried steamed buns and leftovers into the bucket every day, filling it up in a day or two. However, since the launch of the food saving campaign throughout the city, the pig farmer no longer came to Auntie Liu's door. It turned out that Auntie Liu had subscribed to a grain consumption plan in July and had been seriously saving food. At the forum, Auntie Liu opened her mouth and said, "I really shouldn't have wasted food like that in the past."

    Housewives Auntie Gu and Zhang Lanying then shared their experiences.

      Auntie Gu's child used to get sick frequently. However, Auntie Gu never investigated the cause of the illness. After the start of the food saving campaign, she took care to ensure that her child ate meals on time and in fixed quantities. In less than two months, the child's illnesses became less frequent, and she realized that not eating meals on time and in fixed quantities was the cause of the illness. Since subscribing to the grain consumption plan, Zhang Lanying has had a planned daily expenditure for the family. In the past, when she went to the cooperative, she would want to buy good rice when she saw it, and as a result, she could not save money by storing rice, and her plan for living the second half of the month would be disrupted. Now, Zhang Lanying says, "I divide my monthly salary into three parts, first buying grain and then buying oil, and I also arrange my daily pocket money in an orderly manner. In August, my family saved ten jin of rice, which saved one yuan and eighty cents, just enough to buy four pairs of shoe fabric for the four children."

      Many people spoke at the forum. They said that in our courtyard, in the past, there were dried steamed buns everywhere on the ground, and there were often leftovers in the trash cans. Because families lacked a plan for food and money, they were often loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end. Now, every family has posted a food saving agreement and is living a life of careful calculation.

    Someone at the meeting asked: After the implementation of the food rationing method, is there any inconvenience? There was a debate on this issue. Some people said: With the implementation of this method, eating out and buying food is not as convenient and free as it used to be. The housewives from worker families then talked about the half-starved life before liberation. Some said that in the past, they could not buy food even if they earned money, and the workers could not get enough to eat when they went home, which was really inconvenient. Others said that now they can buy food whenever they want, and the only inconvenience is having to bring food stamps. What is that? They talked about how they felt a little troubled when they first used coupons to buy cloth, but now they have gotten used to it. After some debate, the housewives finally agreed: "Everyone should do their part to build socialism. Can't we do this little thing?"

    Finally, everyone talked about what they should do at present. The following two guarantees were almost mentioned by everyone: 1. The methods of saving food have not been exhausted, and we must be more careful in September, arrange our lives well, and realize the family's grain consumption plan. 2. The grading and rationing will begin soon, and everyone should assess the grain consumption level in a realistic manner in this work. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 主妇们的座谈会

专栏：作好市镇粮食定量供应工作

    主妇们的座谈会
    住在天津六区土城“北洋工房”大院的十二个工人家庭的主妇，最近举行了一个有意义的座谈会，讨论按计划用粮的好处。她们中有些是一向勤俭的主妇，也有过去不注意节约粮食的主妇。
    刘大娘就曾是一个浪费粮食的人。过去，她蒸馒头一蒸就是两大笼屉，放干了，扔在窗台上。别人问她，她说：“嗐，我那是留着做酱的。”有个养猪人，准备了一个大桶放在她家门口。刘大娘和别的人家每天把干馒头、剩饭都倒在桶里，一两天就是一满桶。可是，自从节约粮食运动在全市开展以来，养猪人再不来刘大娘的门前了。原来，刘大娘在七月份订了用粮计划，认真节约了粮食。座谈会上，刘大娘开口就说：“我过去那样浪费粮食可真不应该。”
    主妇顾婶和张兰英紧接着讲了自己的经验。
      顾婶的孩子过去经常闹病。可是顾婶始终没有追究过闹病的原因。在节约粮食运动开始以后，她留心照顾孩子定时定量吃饭。不到两个月，孩子的病少起来了，她这才知道吃饭没有定时定量，是致病的原因。张兰英从订用粮计划以后，家庭日用开支有计划了。过去她到合作社看到好米就想买，结果存米就积不下钱，下半月过日子的计划就打乱了。现在呢，张兰英说：“我把每月的工资分成三份，先买粮食再买油，每天的零用钱也安排得有条有理的。八月里我家节约了十斤米，就省下一元八角钱，正好给四个孩子买四双鞋面布。”
      座谈会上说话的人很多，她们说，我们这个大院里，过去地上到处有干馒头，垃圾箱里常常有剩饭。因为家庭用粮用钱缺乏计划，常常月初松月末紧。现在家家都贴出了节约粮食公约，精打细算地过日子。
    会上有人提出：粮食定量供应办法实行后，有什么不方便吗？在这个问题上有了争论，有人说：实行这个办法，出门吃饭、买粮食就不如过去那么方便自由了。工人家庭的主妇们，就谈到解放前半饥半饱的生活情景。有的说，过去挣来钱买不着粮食，工人回家吃不饱饭，那才真叫不方便呢。有的说，现在几时买粮食几时有，只是要带着粮票，这点不方便又算什么？她们谈到刚开始拿票买布时也觉着有些麻烦，现在也就习惯了。经过一番争论，主妇们最后一致的意见是：“人人要为建设社会主义出把力，这件小事咱还办不到吗？”
    最后大家又谈到自己在目前该做些什么事，下面的两条保证几乎是每个人都讲过的：一、节约粮食的办法还没有想尽，九月份更要精打细算，安排好生活，实现家庭的用粮计划。二、评级定量就要开始，大家在这项工作中要实事求是地评定用粮等级。　（新华社）
