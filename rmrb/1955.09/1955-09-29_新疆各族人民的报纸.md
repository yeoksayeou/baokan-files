Newspapers of the People of All Nationalities in Xinjiang
Xu Shuchao

*Xinjiang Daily*, published in Uyghur, Chinese, Kazakh, and Mongolian (the Mongolian version is published every other day), is the organ of the Xinjiang Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the newspaper of the thirteen nationalities of Xinjiang. It conveys the voices of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, and every day brings news from Xinjiang, both domestic and foreign, the voices from Tiananmen Square and Huai Ren Hall in the capital, and the good news of the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to every city north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, and to the vast and remote rural and pastoral areas. From here, the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang hear the footsteps of the times and march towards the goal of socialism together with the people of the whole country.

The Chinese version of *Xinjiang Daily* was first published on December 6, 1949—the seventieth day after the liberation of the entire Xinjiang region. By January of the following year, the original Uyghur and Kazakh versions of *Xinjiang Daily* were also officially changed to Party newspapers, and merged with the Chinese version in August of the same year. At the same time, the Mongolian version was created, becoming the current *Xinjiang Daily*. At the time of its publication, it clearly stated its mission was to further develop and consolidate the broad people's democratic united front, strengthen the leadership of the working class, promote the step-by-step social reform in agricultural areas, publicize and implement the policy of national equality and unity, disseminate Soviet construction experience, and unite all democratic classes and all nationalities of Xinjiang in the affectionate and harmonious family of the motherland, and strive to build a new Xinjiang for the people.

For more than five years, *Xinjiang Daily* has faithfully carried out its mission. From the beginning, it used its main space and strength to participate in stabilizing social order and the struggle of farmers of all nationalities to reduce rents and oppose local tyrants. In the winter of 1950, the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea unfolded throughout Xinjiang like a spring tide. A large number of propagandists went deep into various rural and pastoral areas to carry out propaganda, so that more than four million people of all nationalities in Xinjiang received a profound education in patriotism and internationalism. During the movement, 1.6 million people throughout Xinjiang signed and voted in favor of the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, opposed U.S. imperialism arming Japan, and 1.79 million people directly participated in demonstrations. People of all nationalities enthusiastically donated cash, grain, and livestock, using 30 airplanes and 7 cannons to support the Chinese People's Volunteers who went abroad to fight, and extensively launched activities such as signing patriotic pacts and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The concentrated publicity of the four language versions of *Xinjiang Daily* in this process left a deep impression on the masses of people of all nationalities and powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Wu Gunisha Khan, a 103-year-old Uyghur woman in the seventh district of Urumqi, walked more than 80 miles to Nanshan while ill to pick up wheat ears or spin thread at night to donate in support of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. After this moving deed was published in the newspaper, it soon spread throughout Xinjiang, inspiring the internationalism and patriotism of the people of all nationalities.

From the autumn of 1952 to the end of 1953, a vigorous land reform movement was launched in the agricultural areas of Xinjiang, with a population of about 3.5 million. This movement enabled nearly two million Uyghur, Hui, Han, and other ethnic farmers with little or no land to receive about eight million mu of arable land and other means of production, liberating the productive forces in the vast rural areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. As the mouthpiece of the people, the Uyghur and Chinese versions of *Xinjiang Daily* carried out continuous and concentrated publicity for land reform during this period. Many of the communications and articles published in the newspaper at that time, such as "Between One Household and Five Hundred and Sixty-One Households" and "A Village Devastated by the Landlord Class and Without Songs," fully exposed the cruel facts of landlords occupying farmers' land, orchards, vineyards, and other forms of exploitation of farmers, and pointed out that the feudal land ownership system was the main root cause of the poverty and suffering of all nationalities in Xinjiang, mobilizing all those who love their own nationality and care about the future of their own nationality to support and participate in the land reform movement. The land reform work experience introduced by the newspaper also directly promoted this struggle.

Among the four language versions, the Kazakh and Mongolian versions are aimed at cadres of their own nationalities and the vast number of herdsmen. Since animal husbandry production accounts for a large proportion of Xinjiang's entire national economy, 56 of the 80 counties (including county-level autonomous regions) in Xinjiang have animal husbandry, of which 22 counties (autonomous regions) are purely pastoral areas or areas mainly engaged in animal husbandry. Therefore, reports on animal husbandry production are also a regular and important content of the Chinese and Uyghur versions. In recent years, the newspaper has continuously publicized the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's policies of protecting and developing animal husbandry production, including the pastoral owner economy, and "no struggle, no division, no class designation" and "mutual benefit for herdsmen and pastoral owners." It also regularly reflects and disseminates the achievements and experiences in improving livestock feeding methods, improving livestock breeds, preventing and controlling animal diseases, protecting and cultivating grasslands, and developing trade and medical and health care in pastoral areas. The newspaper constantly used vivid examples and models to prove the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's policies of protecting and developing animal husbandry, and proved that the result of implementing this policy was to make herdsmen of all nationalities prosperous and happy, and eliminated the doubts and concerns of some pastoral owners about the development of animal husbandry production at the beginning of liberation and before and after the land reform in agricultural areas. Communications such as "I am confident that I will develop my cattle and sheep to thousands or tens of thousands" published by the newspaper at that time, received such good results. The newspaper also paid attention to criticizing and correcting the erroneous ideological tendencies of some cadres who had once produced "emphasis on agriculture and neglect of animal husbandry" and "the backwardness of animal husbandry." Now, Xinjiang's constantly developing livestock industry has increased from more than 12 million head of livestock just after liberation to more than 17 million head at the end of 1954. A joyful scene of "prosperity for both people and livestock" is appearing everywhere on the vast grasslands.

After the start of the first five-year plan construction, various language versions of *Xinjiang Daily* further strengthened the publicity of economic construction. The Uyghur and Chinese versions vigorously reported on the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas and water conservancy construction, which is particularly important for the development of agricultural production in Xinjiang. The Kazakh, Mongolian, and Chinese versions did their best to support and advocate the activities of mutual aid and mutual exchange of labor on the basis of the original mutual aid habits of herdsmen, vigorously promoted the movement to increase livestock products and trade work in pastoral areas. As for the achievements of industrial construction in Xinjiang and the whole country, especially the construction of heavy industry and its relationship with farmers and herdsmen of all nationalities, all four language versions made more prominent publicity. The newspaper's publicity and reports during this period were based on Xinjiang's task of implementing the state's first five-year plan. This task stipulates that during the state's first five-year plan period, Xinjiang should focus on vigorously developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, while rectifying and improving existing industrial and mining enterprises, establishing new industries that can balance local supply, production, and sales, developing transportation, postal and telecommunications undertakings, developing state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce step by step, expanding the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and gradually implementing the socialist transformation of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industrial and commercial enterprises, to ensure that the proportion of the socialist economy in the entire national economy gradually increases, in order to appropriately meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people of all nationalities. In order to fully reflect the rapidly changing construction achievements in these many aspects, all four language versions have added the special column "Xinjiang is Moving Forward," focusing on publishing many short and lively news communications such as "Exploration Begins for the Dam Foundation of the Ulabo Reservoir," "Production Troops Reclaim Virgin Wasteland and Build Modernized Farms," and "A Large Number of Xinjiang Sheep Leave the Gongnais Breeding Farm." These reports constitute a vivid picture of Xinjiang's current construction, encouraging people of all nationalities to forge ahead on the road of socialism.

*Xinjiang Daily* also vigorously publicized the policy of national equality and unity. Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic region. Due to the invasion of imperialism and the long-term oppression and provocation of the great-Han chauvinists of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there was a deep division between the various nationalities, especially between the various minority nationalities and the Han nationality. There were also serious disunity phenomena within the various nationalities. After liberation, Party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party and governments at all levels did arduous and great work to fundamentally change this situation. A large number of Han cadres and leading figures who have ties with the local people of all nationalities worked together to eliminate national division and strengthen national unity. The Party and the government also vigorously cultivated ethnic minority cadres and helped ethnic minorities develop their various construction undertakings. In this way, a new relationship of friendship, harmony, unity, and mutual assistance has been established between the various nationalities. Now, all autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties of all nationalities in Xinjiang have been established, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region will soon be established throughout the province. The people of all nationalities who are in charge of their own affairs have further consolidated the unity with all fraternal nationalities. Through its own words, *Xinjiang Daily* constantly and in many ways expounds that consolidating this unity and consolidating the unity of our great motherland is the fundamental guarantee for the prosperity and development of all nationalities in the country. The newspaper also provides a large amount of space to reflect the endless stream of vivid examples of national unity north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. In Xinjiang, the great contributions made by the production troops of the People's Liberation Army to assisting the construction undertakings of the people of all nationalities are a brilliant example of the Han people's loyal and selfless assistance to all fraternal nationalities in moving towards a happy life. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have built large-scale water conservancy projects and modern factories in various places, and used manpower and materials to help people of all nationalities develop production and improve their lives. The newspaper has made in-depth and moving publicity reports on these achievements. The actual lives of the people of all nationalities have also provided endless vivid materials for reports on national unity. When carrying out publicity in this regard, the newspaper has widely used various forms such as news, pictures, comic strips, and letters from readers.

In the process of carrying out its own mission, *Xinjiang Daily* has established close ties with the people of all nationalities. Now, it has more than 3,000 correspondents of all nationalities. These people with a sense of social entrepreneurship are distributed in the vast rural areas and vast pastoral areas north and south of Xinjiang, distributed in various posts and cities. On average, four to five thousand contributions and letters come from far and near every month. The number of readers is increasing, and the newspaper usually has more than 35,000 or 6,000 copies. The distribution range covers the rural and pastoral areas north and south of Xinjiang. Whether in the Altai Mountains and the Pamir Plateau, in the Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin, people can read *Xinjiang Daily* in one or more languages. The newspaper itself has also made great progress. In recent years, it has continuously cultivated and improved reporters, editors, and typesetting workers of all nationalities. It has become a news agency with members of thirteen nationalities, full of the spirit of unity and mutual assistance.

*Xinjiang Daily* also has some shortcomings. It has not done enough in reflecting national life and implementing the policy of national unity. The newspaper's writing is also not popular enough. In this way, the guiding role of the newspaper is weakened. In order to meet the needs of the construction of the motherland and the people of Xinjiang, the newspaper needs to improve in these areas.

    新疆各族人民的报纸
    徐述超
    用维吾尔文、汉文、哈萨克文、蒙古文出版的新疆日报（其中蒙文版是隔日刊），是中共中央新疆分局的机关报，是新疆十三个民族人民自己的报纸。它传达着新疆各族人民的心声，每天把新疆和国内国外的消息，把首都天安门和怀仁堂的声音，把鞍钢和兰新路建设的捷报传播到天山南北的各个城市，传播到辽阔遥远的农村和牧区。新疆各族人民从这里听到了时代前进的脚步声，和全国人民一起迈步向社会主义的目标前进。
    新疆日报汉文版在一九四九年十二月六日——新疆全境解放后的第七十天发刊。到第二年一月，原有的维吾尔文、哈萨克文新疆日报也正式改为党报，并于同年八月同汉文版合并，同时创办了蒙古文版，便成为现在的新疆日报。它在发刊时明确提出自己的任务是：进一步发展和巩固广泛的人民民主统一战线，加强工人阶级的领导作用，推动农业地区有步骤地进行的社会改革，宣传贯彻民族平等团结政策，传播苏联建设经验，团结新疆各民主阶级、各民族人民于祖国友爱和睦的大家庭中，为建设人民的新疆而奋斗。
    五年多来，新疆日报忠实地执行着自己的任务。它一开始就以自己的主要篇幅和力量，参加了安定社会秩序和各族农民减租反恶霸的斗争。一九五○年冬天，全疆有如春潮似地展开了抗美援朝运动，大批的宣传员深入到各个农村、牧区进行宣传，使新疆四百多万各族人民受到了爱国主义和国际主义的深刻教育。运动中，全疆有一百六十万人签名投票拥护缔结五大国和平公约，反对美帝国主义武装日本，并有一百七十九万人直接参加了示威游行；各族人民踊跃捐献现金、粮食、牲畜，以三十架飞机和七门大炮支援了出国作战的中国人民志愿军，并广泛地展开了订立爱国公约、优待烈属、军属等运动。新疆日报四种文版在这一过程中的集中宣传，曾在各族人民群众中留下了深刻印象，有力地推动了抗美援朝运动的深入开展。乌鲁木齐市第七区一百零三岁的维吾尔族老妈妈吾古尼沙汗，带病步行到八十多里外的南山拾麦穗或在晚间纺线来捐献支援抗美援朝，这一动人事迹在报纸上公布后，不久就传遍了全疆各地，激发了各族人民的国际主义和爱国主义热情。
    从一九五二年秋到一九五三年底，全新疆约三百五十万人口的农业地区掀起了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动。这个运动曾使得近两百万无地、少地的维吾尔、回、汉等族农民，分得了约八百万亩左右的耕地和其他生产资料，解放了天山南北广大农村的生产力。作为人民的喉舌，新疆日报维吾尔文、汉文版在这期间曾连续集中地进行了土地改革的宣传。报纸当时发表的许多通讯和文章，例如“一户与五百六十一户之间”、“一个被地主阶级摧残得没有歌声的村子”等等，充分暴露了地主霸占农民土地、果园、葡萄园以及其他各种压榨农民的残酷事实，并指出封建的土地所有制是新疆各民族遭受贫困和灾难的主要根源，动员一切热爱本民族和关心本民族前途的人拥护和参加到土地改革运动里来。报纸所介绍的土地改革工作经验，也直接推动了这一斗争。
    在四种文版中，哈萨克文、蒙古文版是以本民族干部和广大牧民为对象的。由于畜牧业生产在新疆整个国民经济中占着很大比重，全疆八十个县（包括县级自治区）中有五十六个县（自治区）有畜牧业，其中二十二个县（自治区）是纯牧区或以牧业为主的地区，因此，有关畜牧业生产的报道，也是汉文、维吾尔文版经常的、重要的内容之一。几年来，报纸不断地宣传了中国共产党和人民政府保护和发展包括牧主经济在内的畜牧业生产和“不斗、不分、不划阶级”、“牧工、牧主两利”的政策。对各地改善牲畜饲养方法、改良牲畜品种、防治兽疫、保护和培育草场以及开展牧区贸易和医疗卫生等方面的成就和经验，也作了经常的反映和传播。报纸不断运用活的事例和榜样证明了中国共产党和人民政府保护和发展畜牧业政策的正确性，证明了实行这一政策的结果是使各族牧民得到繁荣和幸福，消除了部分牧主在解放初期和农业区土地改革前后对发展畜牧业生产所引起的怀疑和顾虑。报纸当时发表的“我有信心把牛羊发展到几千只几万只”等通讯，都收到了这样的良好效果。报纸也注意批判和纠正了少数干部曾经产生的“重农轻牧”、“牧业落后论”等错误的思想倾向。现在，全新疆年年发展着的牲畜业已由刚解放时的一千二百多万头牲畜增加到一九五四年年底的一千七百多万头，辽阔的草原上到处呈现出“人畜两旺”的欢乐景象。
    第一个五年计划建设开始以后，新疆日报各种文版进一步加强了经济建设的宣传。维吾尔文、汉文版大力报道了农村的互助合作运动以及在新疆对发展农业生产特别重要的水利建设。哈萨克文、蒙古文以及汉文版在报道中尽力支持和提倡牧民在原有互助习惯的基础上开展互助变工的活动，大力推动畜产品的增产运动和牧区的贸易工作。至于新疆和全国的工业建设，特别是重工业建设的成就和它同各族农牧民的关系，四种文版都作了比较突出的宣传。报纸这个时期以来的宣传报道是以新疆地区执行国家第一个五年计划的任务为依据的。这个任务规定新疆在国家第一个五年计划期间，以大力发展农业和畜牧业生产为中心，同时整顿、提高现有工矿企业，举办地方供、产、销能够平衡的新的工业，发展交通运输、邮电事业，有步骤地发展国营商业和合作社商业，扩大城乡物资交流，对个体农业、手工业和私营工商业逐步实行社会主义改造，保证社会主义经济在全部国民经济中的比重逐步增长，以适当地满足各族人民日益增长的物质生活和文化生活的需要。为了充分反映这许多方面日新月异的建设成就，四种文版都增辟了“新疆在前进”的专栏，集中发表如“乌拉泊水库坝基工程开始钻探”、“生产部队开垦原始荒地建设现代化农场”、“大批新疆羊自巩乃斯种羊场出场”等许多短小活泼的消息通讯。这些报道构成了新疆目前建设的生动图景，鼓舞着各族人民在社会主义的道路上奋勇前进。
    新疆日报还大力地宣传了民族平等团结的政策。新疆是一个多民族地区，由于帝国主义的侵略和国民党反动派大民族主义者的长期压榨和挑拨，各民族之间特别是各少数民族同汉族之间的隔阂很深。各民族内部也有严重的不团结现象。解放后，中国共产党各级党委和各级人民政府做了艰苦而巨大的工作，来从根本上改变这种情况。大批的汉族干部和同当地各族人民有联系的领袖人物在一起，尽力消除民族隔阂，加强民族团结。党和人民政府并大力培养民族干部，帮助少数民族发展自己的各项建设事业。这样，就使各民族之间建立起了友爱和睦、团结互助的新关系。现在，全疆各民族自治州、自治县已全部建立，全省范围内的新疆维吾尔自治区也即将成立，当家作主的各民族更加巩固了同各兄弟民族之间的团结。新疆日报通过自己的言论，不断地、多方面地阐述巩固这种团结，巩固我们伟大祖国的统一，是全国各族人民获得繁荣发展的根本保证。报纸还提供大量篇幅，来反映天山南北民族团结方面层出不穷的生动事例。在新疆，人民解放军生产部队对援助各族人民的建设事业所作的巨大贡献，是汉族人民忠诚无私援助各兄弟民族走向幸福生活的光辉范例。解放军战士在各地兴修大型水利工程，建设现代化工厂，用人力、物力帮助各族人民发展生产、改善生活，报纸对于这些成就，都作了深入人心的宣传报道。各族人民的现实生活也给民族团结的报道提供了无尽的生动题材，报纸在进行这方面的宣传时，广泛运用了消息、图片、连环画和读者来信等各种形式。
    在执行自己的任务的过程中，新疆日报同各族人民建立起了密切的联系。现在，它拥有三千名以上的各族通讯员，这些有着社会事业家感觉的人们分布在南北疆广大的农村和辽阔的牧区，分布在各个岗位和城市；平均每月来自远近各地的来稿来信达四、五千件。读者在增加着，报纸发行份数通常在三万五、六千份以上。发行范围遍及南北疆的农村、牧区，无论在阿尔泰山和帕米尔高原，在准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地，人们都可以读到一种或几种文字的新疆日报。报社本身也有很大发展。几年来，它不断地培养、提高了各民族的记者、编辑和排字工人，它已成为一个有十三个民族成份成员、充满着团结互助精神的新闻机构。
    新疆日报也还有一些缺点，它在反映民族生活、贯彻民族团结政策方面，都作得不十分够。报纸文字也不够通俗。这样，就减弱了报纸的指导作用。为了适应祖国建设和新疆人民的需要，报纸需要在这些方面加以改进。
