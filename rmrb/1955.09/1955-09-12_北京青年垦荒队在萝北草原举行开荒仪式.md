Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 11th: On September 10th, on the Luobei County grassland in Heilongjiang Province, on the border of the motherland, the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team solemnly held a land reclamation ceremony on the beautiful butterfly-shaped 20,000-hectare wasteland on the banks of the Dulu River. Ruan Yongsheng, Secretary of the Luobei County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and representatives of the villagers came to congratulate them. Ruan Yongsheng congratulated the reclamation team members on starting a new life of building youth villages and youth cities in the sparsely populated wilderness. The team members raised their right hands and solemnly swore: to persevere to the end, to turn the wilderness into a paradise, and to open up roads for later generations of youth. They wrote to the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, guaranteeing that during the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, they would reclaim 1,500 mu of wasteland as a gift to the conference.

After Ruan Yongsheng, Secretary of the Luobei County Committee of the Communist Party of China, cut the ribbon, Yang Hua, the captain of the reclamation team, issued the order to start land reclamation. At this time, four sets of reclamation plows with six strong horses each started working at the same time. Where the plow passed, the green grassland turned into black-brown fertile fields. Ruan Yongsheng and Yang Hua grabbed a handful of black, oily, wet soil and looked at the endless grassland, their faces showing excited smiles.

The Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team mainly uses animal-powered farm tools for land reclamation. It is relatively difficult to reclaim land in the grassland with animal-powered farm tools in autumn. In order to overcome the difficulties and facilitate animal-powered cultivation, the reclamation team specifically asked the survey team to plan the wasteland to be reclaimed this year into equal rectangular plots. In the past two days, they have conducted trial plowing on these plots. Twenty reclamation team members also humbly learned reclamation methods and the experience of operating plows from technicians sent by the state-owned Baoquanling Mechanical Farm and youths from Huachuan County who had worked as animal-powered farm tool operators and came to help with reclamation. Pang Shuying, a female reclamation team member who had never seen a reclamation plow, has already learned how to use a plow to reclaim land.

The basic construction projects such as the construction of dormitories, warehouses, stables, and wells next to the wasteland started on the 6th.

    北京青年垦荒队在萝北草原举行开荒仪式
    新华社哈尔滨十一日电　九月十日，在祖国边疆的黑龙江省萝北县草原上，北京市青年志愿垦荒队在都噜河畔美丽的蝴蝶形的二万公顷荒地上，隆重地举行了开荒仪式。中共萝北县委书记阮永胜和村民代表前来祝贺。阮永胜祝贺垦荒队员在人迹罕至的旷野里建设青年村、青年城的新生活的开始。队员们高举起右手庄严地宣誓：要坚持到底，把荒野变成乐园，为后来的青年开辟道路。他们向中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会写信保证在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会开会期间，开垦出一千五百亩荒地，作为向大会的献礼。
    中共萝北县委书记阮永胜剪彩后，由垦荒队队长杨华发出了开始开荒的命令。这时四台套着六匹壮马的垦荒犁一齐出动，犁杖过处，碧绿的草原变成了黑褐色的良田。阮永胜和杨华抓起一把黑油油的湿土，望着望不到头的草原，脸上露出兴奋的笑容。
    北京市青年志愿垦荒队开荒主要是使用畜力农具。秋天在草原上用畜力农具开荒是比较艰苦的。垦荒队队员们为了克服困难，便于畜力耕作，特请勘测队把今年将要开垦的荒地规划成相等的长方形地块，前两天他们已在这些地块上进行了试犁。二十个垦荒队员还虚心地向国营宝泉岭机械农场派来的技术员和曾作过畜力农具手的桦川县来帮助垦荒的青年，学习了开荒方法和操纵犁的经验。从未见过垦荒犁的女垦荒队队员庞淑英已经学会了用犁开荒。
    在荒地旁边建设宿舍、仓库、马厩和水井等的基本建设工程，已在六日破土动工。
