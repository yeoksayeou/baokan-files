    Grotewohl's Statement

    Respected Comrade Chairman of the Council of Ministers! Dear Comrades!

    First, allow me to express, on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, our gratitude to you for inviting us to Moscow for these talks. Our discussions are a continuation of the talks we held in Berlin from July 24th to 27th of this year.

    Our shared starting point at that time was that the Geneva Conference had helped to ease tensions in international relations, and that in order to safeguard peace and the security of all peoples, negotiations must continue in the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation. We believe that concluding bilateral agreements between states on the issue of the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic is appropriate because such agreements contribute to safeguarding peace and strengthening the German Democratic Republic, thereby helping to reunify Germany into a peace-loving and democratic state.

    We also thank the Soviet government for its efforts that led to the reconciliation of the international situation and the success of the Geneva Conference. If such a relaxation of tensions could also occur in Europe and in Germany, a peaceful solution to the German question would become possible.

    We proceed from the actual situation, which is that there are two German states with different social systems existing on German territory. In the German Democratic Republic, the rule of monopoly capital and the Junkers has been overthrown. A worker-peasant state led by the working class in alliance with the laboring peasantry and progressive intellectuals has been established. Thus, militarism in the German Democratic Republic has been eradicated, and peace forces pursuing a genuine peace policy have grown up. Therefore, the German Democratic Republic has become a bastion of peace in Germany. Conversely, in West Germany, the economy and state apparatus are controlled by monopoly capitalists, and militarists are once again issuing orders there. The two German states currently exist simultaneously and are recognized by some countries.

    Most German people deeply regret that the Paris Agreements continue to obstruct the resolution of the German question. The main responsibility for this should be borne by the militarist groups in West Germany. These groups are once again cultivating a militarist spirit, which once led to crimes against the peoples of Europe, particularly against the Soviet people, and plunged the German people into an abyss of terrible suffering. We will never allow these crimes to be repeated. Therefore, we agree with the Soviet government's view that the only way to guarantee the security of the peoples of Europe and establish lasting peace is to create a European collective security system that will gradually eliminate the existing military blocs in Europe. Since a pan-European treaty on collective security has not yet been concluded, the German Democratic Republic will continue to fulfill its obligations under the Warsaw Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance in the future.

    Every political leader must clearly recognize that a reunified Germany must never be a militarist state. A unified Germany must not participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, if both German states participate in a pan-European collective security system, then reunification along peaceful and democratic lines will be possible. I reiterate on behalf of the German Democratic Republic what I said in the People's Chamber: the government of the German Democratic Republic is prepared to make its contribution to the establishment of such a collective security system. In the current situation, we have decided to redouble our efforts to bring Germans to the negotiating table and reach an agreement among themselves. The time has come for the Federal Republic of West Germany to revise its policies and promote a peaceful solution to the German question, after the failure of its policy of strength.

    This will be beneficial to cooperation between the two German governments. Joint negotiations will help create a foundation for creating conditions conducive to the reunification of Germany into a peace-loving, democratic German state, thereby making it possible to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

    We also express the hope that the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference will reach an agreement on the establishment of a collective security system in order to help the German people seek a path to unification in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles. We recognize that the primary responsibility for reunification lies with the German people. Therefore, we welcome the steps taken by the Soviet Union to normalize relations with the Federal Republic of Germany by establishing diplomatic relations.

    We hope, based on the interests of the entire German people and the Soviet peoples, that this normalization will also develop into a genuine friendship between the residents of West Germany and the Soviet Union. The German Democratic Republic has maintained a sacred friendship with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics since its establishment. This is in line with the national interests of the entire German people.

    According to the Warsaw Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, our two countries have been united by an alliance that is in line with the political and economic interests of its contracting parties, as well as their security interests.

    We believe that the time has come to place all issues concerning the strengthening and expansion of our two countries' political, economic, and cultural cooperation, as well as all other relations, on a state legal basis.

    We unanimously agree that we will carry out this work based on equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs, in accordance with the interests of our two peoples.

    We have come here with the conviction that we will be able to jointly achieve new victories and make progress in deepening and strengthening the friendship between our two peoples, defending peace, and restoring Germany's unity through peaceful and democratic means.

    For our further work, we suggest that our experts immediately begin consultations and make recommendations so that we can reach a final agreement on the text of the documents we have already agreed to draft, based on these recommendations. We are referring first and foremost to the wording of the treaty on relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

### 格罗提渥总理的声明

专栏：

    格罗提渥总理的声明尊敬的部长会议主席同志！亲爱的同志们！
    首先请允许我代表德意志民主共和国政府感谢你们邀请我们到莫斯科来举行这次会谈。我们的会谈是今年七月二十四日到二十七日我们在柏林举行的会谈的继续。
    我们那时所持的一致出发点是：日内瓦会议已经帮助缓和了国际关系中的紧张气氛，为了保障和平和各国人民的安全，必须继续本着互相谅解和合作的精神进行谈判。我们认为，就德意志民主共和国的主权问题缔结国家间的双边协定是适宜的，因为这种协定有助于保障和平和加强德意志民主共和国，从而有助于把德国重新统一为一个爱好和平的和民主的国家。
    我们还感谢苏联政府，因为它所作的努力导致了国际局势的和解和日内瓦会议的成功。如果在欧洲和在德国也能出现这种紧张气氛的缓和，德国问题的和平解决就会成为可能。
    我们是从实际局势出发的，实际局势就是，在德国领土上存在着有着不同的社会制度的两个德意志国家。在德意志民主共和国，垄断资本和容克贵族的统治已被推翻。一个由同劳动农民和进步智识分子结成联盟的工人阶级领导的工农国家已经成立。因此，军国主义在德意志民主共和国已经根除，奉行真正的和平政策的和平力量已经成长起来。因此，德意志民主共和国已经成为德国和平的堡垒。相反的，在西德，经济和国家机器受到垄断资本家的控制，军国主义分子又在那里发号施令了。两个德意志国家目前同时存在着，并且都得到了一些国家的承认。
    大多数德国人民对于巴黎协定一直阻挠着德国问题的解决深感遗憾。这一点的主要责任应当由西德的军国主义集团来负。这些集团正在再度培植军国主义精神，而这种精神曾导致对欧洲各国人民、特别是对苏联人民的犯罪，并且曾把德国人民投入可怕的痛苦的深渊。我们决不容许这些罪行的重演。所以我们同意苏联政府的意见：保障欧洲各国人民的安全和建立持久和平的唯一方法，就是建立将使欧洲现存的军事集团逐渐消灭的欧洲集体安全体系。由于关于集体安全的全欧条约尚未缔结，所以德意志民主共和国今后将继续履行华沙友好合作互助条约的义务。
    每一个政治领袖必须清楚地认识到，一个重新统一的德国绝不能是一个军国主义的国家。整个德国决不能参加北大西洋公约组织。然而，假如两个德意志国家都参加全欧集体安全体系，那末按照和平民主的方针重新统一将是可能的。我代表德意志民主共和国重申我在人民议院中说过的话：德意志民主共和国政府准备对建立这种集体安全体系作出它的贡献。在目前的情况下，我们已经决定要加倍努力，以便使德国人坐在谈判桌旁谈判，并且在他们之间达成协议。在实力政策遭受失败之后，西德联邦共和国修改它的政策并且促进用和平方法解决德国问题的时候已经到来了。
    这将利于两个德国政府之间的合作。共同谈判便于造成一种基础，以创造利于德国重新统一为一个爱好和平的、民主的德意志国家的状态，从而使得同德国缔结和约成为可能。
    我们也表示希望日内瓦的四国外交部长会议将就建立一个集体安全体系的问题达成协议，以便帮助德国人民谋求按照和平和民主的方针实现统一的道路。我们认识到重新统一的主要责任在德国人民身上。因此，我们欢迎苏联所采取的步骤：通过同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系来使两国关系正常化。
    我们从全体德国人民和苏联各族人民的利益出发，希望这种正常化也将发展成为西德居民同苏联间的真正友谊。德意志民主共和国从建立的日子起就同苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟保持着神圣的友谊。这是符合全体德国人民的民族利益的。
    根据华沙友好合作互助条约，我们两国已经被一个联盟团结在一起，这个联盟是符合它的各缔约国的政治和经济利益以及它们的安全的利益的。
    我们认为，已经到了把关于加强和扩大我们两国间的政治、经济和文化合作以及一切其他关系的全部问题置于一种国家法律基础之上的时候了。
    我们一致同意，我们将在平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上、根据我们两国人民的利益来进行这项工作。
    我们是带着这样的信念到这里来的：我们将能够共同在加深和加强我们两国人民的友谊、保卫和平和用和平和民主的方法恢复德国的统一方面取得新的胜利并且获得进展。
    为了我们进一步的工作，我们建议我们的专家们立即着手进行商谈并且提出建议，以便我们能够根据这些建议就我们已经一致同意草拟的文件的文本达成最后协议。我们所指的首先是关于德意志民主共和国同苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的关系的条约的措辞问题。
