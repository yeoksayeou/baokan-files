    Xinjiang is a Wonderful Place
    Chu Anping

    Whenever Xinjiang is mentioned, people have various ideas. The names of the Tianshan, Kunlun, and Altai Mountains give people a sense of infinite height and grandeur; the words Gurbantunggut Desert, the great Gobi of the Tarim Basin, and the salt flats of the reed marshes remind people of desolation and loneliness. Over the past year, as I have wandered through this vast land, seeing the eternally unchanging snow peaks, the lush and deep forest colors, the lake scenery that merges with the sky, and the plains that always seem like a vast ocean from afar, my heart has been opened, and my spirit has become heroic. On this land, among the mountains, by the lakesides, and in the forests, appear golden wheat waves, snow-mountain-like cotton piles, and countless fat cattle and sheep, making people deeply feel that our motherland is vast and broad, beautiful and rich.

    Many people always think that Xinjiang is a very cold place. This is not a question that can be explained in a single sentence. Xinjiang's area is equal to sixteen Zhejiang provinces. Over such a large area, the temperature cannot be uniform. Some places, such as the Altai Mountains, are generally colder in winter, but some places, such as Kashgar and Hotan in southern Xinjiang, are very warm in winter and do not even require wearing an overcoat. Traveling in the suburbs is colder, but living in the cities is warmer. When cold air arrives, of course, it will be colder, but when there is no cold air, it is not necessarily very cold. So, whether Xinjiang is cold or not cannot be generalized in one sentence. Last November, I was in the Chabuqia'er Xibe Autonomous County in the Ili region when a cold air mass hit. I was riding in a light carriage in sub-zero twenty-degree weather, under a sky full of sunshine, driving from Chabuqia'er back to Yining. The horses, with icicles on their manes, galloped across the snow, making a slight metallic sound. Such a journey was nothing less than the most beautiful and unforgettable enjoyment for me. The outdoor temperature in Urumqi in winter is generally around minus twenty degrees Celsius. Even on the coldest days, people still come and go in the streets, and children still carry their schoolbags to school.

    People also think that Xinjiang is a very desolate place. Xinjiang does have many mountains, deserts, grass lakes, and wastelands. Generally speaking, it is a vast land with a sparse population. If you are dispirited, shortsighted, and content with staying in a small room, then when you arrive in a place like Xinjiang and see the endless desert, you will naturally feel a sense of desolation. But if you are not such a person, if you have a high enthusiasm for labor, a strong spirit of creation, and are full of fighting spirit, wanting to do something for the motherland, then you will feel fortunate to be born in such a great country, and even more fortunate to be born in such a great era! The thousands of miles of winding, overlapping mountains, I don't know how many valuable treasures are buried, just waiting for thousands upon thousands of young men and women to survey and explore year after year. The vast, boundless fertile wilderness is also waiting for hundreds of thousands of people to cultivate and manage it, to awaken these lands from their long sleep, to let them be nourished by the river water, regain life, and begin to serve to strengthen the country's power. People with strong wills will never feel desolate when they see these vast wildernesses; the feelings they experience can only be excitement, pride, and a desire to try.

    Many of the past views and impressions of Xinjiang need to be fundamentally reversed today. For example, everyone who talks about Xinjiang says that Xinjiang lacks water. But today, it can be stated with certainty that what Xinjiang lacks is not water, but engineering construction and scientific management of water. If canals are dug to bring river water to the fields, and reservoirs are built to store unused water, then the utilization rate of water can be greatly improved. If we open up water sources and reduce water leakage and waste, in a foreseeable future, Xinjiang's water will be basically sufficient for the development of agricultural production. In the past era of reactionary regimes, the authorities did not pay attention to these issues, let alone seriously carry out water conservancy construction. After liberation, many water conservancy projects have been built in Hami, Yanqi, Aksu, and the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang, which have played a significant role in production. Now the government is continuing to carry out various water conservancy projects and is also teaching people to use water reasonably. The old idea that Xinjiang lacks water should be completely changed today.

    In the past, people thought that Xinjiang had little rain and water, and many places were deserts, which led to many one-sided and incorrect impressions. Some people think that since Xinjiang lacks water, there are no rivers, but in fact, Xinjiang has many large rivers. Not only are there many rivers, but there are also many lakes and marshes (collectively called "seas" locally). These rivers have always been the lifeline of the people on both banks. Not only do vast farmlands rely on it for irrigation, but many places can also use hydropower for industrial power and lighting for citizens in the future; some waterways can also be navigable after being improved in the future. Some people think that since Xinjiang has little rain and water, there must not be many trees. In fact, from Qitai in the west to Ili in the east, on the shady side of the Tianshan Mountains, there are lush spruce trees for thousands of miles, which are the main source of timber for Xinjiang's infrastructure construction. In general cities and villages, the trees are also very lush. In Xinjiang, the fraternal ethnic groups generally have the habit of planting trees, and when they plant trees, they plant dozens of miles, or thousands of plants, both in large numbers and densely. Whether in pastoral or rural areas, wherever there is water, there must be trees. Especially in the Gobi Desert, if you see trees far away in front of you, there must be water and people there. In southern Xinjiang and Ili, many families plant fruit trees in their homes. In Xinjiang, people clearly feel the benefits of planting trees in their lives: shade, building houses, firewood, and eating fruit. When I traveled in Xinjiang, I often passed through lush shade-lined roads with continuous forests. Once, when traveling in southern Xinjiang, from the east to the west of Baicheng County, along the highway, there were willow and poplar trees planted for a stretch of one hundred and sixty or seventy li without a break. And the abundance of trees in Yining, all white poplars, is a major feature of this famous city in the western border of the motherland.

    Similarly, when some people hear me talk about the abundance of fish in Xinjiang, they are surprised. They think that since Xinjiang is a desert, where can there be fish? But in fact, some of the main rivers in Xinjiang are full of fish. This year, I have eaten fish from the Ili River, the Manas River, the Kaidu River, the Peacock River, the Tarim River, and the Aksu River. The Kuerti River under the Altai Mountains is also famous for its fish. In Urumqi, I also saw live crucian carp for sale at the fish stalls.

    People always think that Xinjiang is a poor place. In the past, the lives of the people of Xinjiang were indeed very poor, mainly due to the cruel oppression of the feudal reactionary regimes of the old era. In fact, Xinjiang is not only not poor, but very rich. Although Xinjiang's underground resources have not been extensively surveyed and the quantity of these resources cannot be estimated, the abundance of Xinjiang's resources is a definite fact. There are large reserves of oil, coal, and iron, as well as many precious non-ferrous metals. In terms of agriculture, Xinjiang's land is also surprisingly fertile. Today, the highest national yields of several major agricultural products in China have been created in Xinjiang. Xinjiang's wheat production has reached a maximum of 1,373 jin per mu, rice a maximum of 2,205 jin per mu, and cotton a maximum of 1,349 jin per mu. Although these high-yield records have only been created on some small areas, they are enough to illustrate the fertility of Xinjiang's land and its potential in agricultural production. In terms of melon and fruit production, in addition to the cantaloupe and Turpan grapes that are well-known in the mainland, other fruits such as pears, peaches, apricots, apples, pomegranates, cherries, figs, watermelons, and peanuts are abundant and good. Last summer, when I traveled to Ili, I could buy five apples for one jiao. In early summer this year, when I was in the Kuche and Aksu areas, I could buy thirty apricots for one jiao. These were purchased from street vendors, and it would be even cheaper to buy directly from the orchards. It is said that in some places in southern Xinjiang, you can buy a peach tree for two or three yuan, and all the peaches on the tree belong to you. Except for a few tropical fruits, most domestic melons and fruits can be found in Xinjiang.

    Xinjiang is also one of China's major pastoral areas. There are many natural and beautiful pastures here. Last year, when I traveled in Nilek, Xinyuan, Gongliu, Tekes, and Zhaosu in the Ili region, all that I saw was green or blue. The carpet-like green grass covered all the grasslands and hillsides endlessly. A piece of turquoise, a piece of emerald green; other than turquoise and emerald green, almost no other color can be seen. Even the air people breathe seems to be "green air," particularly fresh and refreshing. The Nanshan area of Urumqi, the Bayinbuluke area of Bayingol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, and the Altai Mountains are all infinitely beautiful and vast pastoral areas. Those hard-working herdsmen graze their cattle and sheep on these high-mountain grasslands. Yurts, mare's milk, dombra (musical instrument), plus the infinitely beautiful pastoral mountain scenery and the fresh and refreshing high-mountain climate, make the lives of herdsmen in these areas full of poetic beauty.

    This year, I have traveled to more than twenty places in Xinjiang, large and small. Every time I went to a place, the Han comrades working there always praised the local area to me—how rich the products were, how beautiful the scenery was, as long as you work hard, you can create a happy life, and so on. This actually reflects the situation that people who have not been to Xinjiang are influenced by old and incorrect views, thinking that Xinjiang is a relatively desolate place and there is nothing attractive about it, but people who have come to Xinjiang and settled down in Xinjiang have carefully experienced that Xinjiang has its own lovable and desirable aspects, and deeply feel that this place has unlimited possibilities for creation and development. Especially in the past few years since liberation, Xinjiang has made many new improvements and achievements in various aspects. Under the active leadership and assistance of the Party and the government, agricultural production has made considerable achievements in improving seeds, promoting new agricultural tools, and new farming methods. The water conservancy projects built by the troops stationed in Xinjiang and the productive labor of the troops have given great help and enlightenment to the local ethnic elders. In 1954, the cotton planted by the farmers in Turpan reached a record of 314 jin of seed cotton per mu on a large area of 30,000 mu, which is a remarkable thing. There have also been new improvements in animal husbandry. Herdsmen have realized that the "Xinjiang sheep" promoted by the government are better than the original local sheep in terms of wool, meat, and milk. In terms of artificial insemination, lambing and raising lambs, and cutting grass and building sheds for the winter, herdsmen have also received various necessary assistance from the government. The active development of agricultural and pastoral production, coupled with the increase in the prices of agricultural and pastoral products and the decrease in the prices of industrial products, will inevitably greatly improve the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Schools and enrollment have generally increased. Medical and health services and the screening of movies have not only reached smaller cities, but have also penetrated into smaller rural areas and remote pastoral areas, which is unprecedented in the history of Xinjiang.

    The face of the city has also changed greatly. Take Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, for example. This place was ruled by Yang Zengxin, Jin Shuren, Sheng Shicai, the Kuomintang, etc. for nearly forty years since the Republic of China. Until it was about to be liberated, it was still a mess of "uneven roads, dim lights, and unreliable telephones." No city is more likely to make people clearly see the contrast between the old and new eras than Urumqi. In this city, almost everything left over from the old society is dilapidated; all the new and tidy buildings you see now have been built in the past few years since liberation; the newly built buildings are mostly equipped with modern sanitary facilities and heating equipment. Roads and city appearance have also been greatly improved. At present, the main streets of Urumqi have been paved with asphalt, and there are several urban transportation lines with buses. The Mingyuan area in the western suburbs used to be a wasteland, but now it has been built into a fairly modern new urban area in Urumqi. There have been increases in hospitals and theaters, and their scale and equipment are first-class. More importantly, since liberation, Urumqi has transformed from a consumer city to a production city, and for the first time in Xinjiang's history, there have been modern industries: the iron and steel industry, the machinery manufacturing industry, the power industry, and the textile industry. These modern industries are making huge contributions to developing the production and improving the lives of the people of Xinjiang. Recently, many foreign guests who have arrived in Urumqi have expressed surprise when they see such a fairly modern city on the western border of China.

    In order to support the construction of the border areas, in the past few years, many patriotic young men and women have continued to come to Xinjiang from all corners of the motherland. Whether in the army, in factories, in mines, or in cities, we often meet many young girls speaking Shandong dialect, Hunan dialect, and Shanghai dialect. Their appearance marks the care and support of the people of all parts of the motherland for the fraternal ethnic groups of Xinjiang and the construction of Xinjiang; it marks the heroic style of the new generation of young people who are not afraid of hardship and dedicate themselves to the border areas. Our country has the tremendous strength and determination to develop the border areas, create new history, and advance every corner of the motherland into a happy socialist society.

    Chairman Mao's ethnic policy of equality, unity, friendship, and mutual assistance has achieved great success in Xinjiang in recent years. The Han and fraternal ethnic groups get along in harmony, trust and help each other, and indeed live like a big family. This year, wherever I went, even to the most remote small villages, the local fraternal ethnic groups treated me with unparalleled enthusiasm, giving me full help and care in work and life, talking and laughing, without any strangeness. They regarded me as a respectable guest from the capital of the motherland, from the place where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are located. (Attached pictures)

    新疆好地方
    储安平
    一提起新疆，人们便会有各种不同的想法。天山、昆仑山、阿尔泰山这些名字，给人们以一种无限高大雄伟的感觉；古尔班通古特沙漠、塔里木盆地的大戈壁以及苇湖碱滩这些字眼，又使人们联想到荒凉落寞。这一年来，我在这一大片土地上漫游，看到那亘古不化的雪峰、葱郁深邃的林色、水天相接的湖景以及那远远看来永远像一片浩瀚的海洋似的平原，心胸开放，意气豪迈。就在这土地上、山岭间、湖滩边、森林里，出现着黄金色的麦浪，雪山似的棉堆以及那数也数不清的肥壮的牛羊，使人深切感到，我们的祖国辽阔而又广大，美丽而又富庶。
    很多人总以为新疆这地方很冷。这不是一句话可以笼统解释得了的问题。新疆的面积有十六个浙江省大。在这样一个大面积上，气温不可能一无差别，有些地方，例如阿尔泰山一带，在冬天一般要比较冷些，但有些地方，如南疆的喀什、和阗一带，冬天就很温暖，甚至不需要穿大衣。冬季在郊外旅行，比较冷些，在城市里住着，就比较暖和。寒流来时，当然要冷些，没有寒流的时候，就不一定很冷。所以新疆冷或不冷，不能用一句话来概括。去年十一月底，我正在伊犁地区的察布查尔锡伯族自治县，正巧寒流侵袭，当我在零下二十度的天气里，坐了一辆轻便马车，在满天的好太阳下，从察布查尔驶回伊宁时，那带着冰凌的马匹，在雪地上一路疾驶，发出轻微的金属似的响声，这样的旅行对于我毋宁是一次最优美难忘的享受。乌鲁木齐冬天户外的温度一般在零下二十度左右，即使最冷的日子，人们照样在街上来来往往，而孩子们也照样提着书包上学。
    人们又以为新疆这地方很荒凉。新疆确是山岭多、戈壁多、草湖多、荒地多。总的说来是土地辽阔，人烟稀少。假如你意气萎靡，目光如鼠，满足于株守斗室之内，那末你到了新疆这样的地方，看到大漠连天，自然会兴起荒凉之感。假如你不是这样一个人，假如你劳动的热情很高，创造的精神很旺，满怀斗志，想为祖国做一番事业，那你就会感到你何幸而生在这样一个伟大的国家，更何幸而又生在这样一个伟大的时代！那迤逦千里、峰峦重叠的群山之间，不知道埋藏着多少宝贵的财富，正需要数以千计万计的青年男女穷年累月地去勘测钻探。那浩瀚的一望无边的肥沃的原野，也正等待着十万百万的人们去开垦经营，让这些土地从多年的沉睡中苏醒过来，使它们得到河水的滋润，恢复生命，开始为增强国家的力量而服务。意志坚强的人们，看了这些辽阔的原野，决不会发生荒凉的感觉；他们发生的感情只能是兴奋、骄傲和跃跃欲试。
    过去人们对于新疆的许多看法和印象，今天需要从根本上扭转过来。例如自来论新疆的人都说新疆缺水。但在今天，可以肯定地说，新疆缺的不是水，而是对水的工程建设和科学管理。假如一面开挖水渠，把河水引到田里，一面修筑水库，把不用的水积储起来，那末水的利用率就可以大大提高。一面开辟水源，一面减少水的渗漏浪费，在一个可以预见的未来的日子里，新疆的水对于农业生产的发展，基本上是够用的。在过去的反动政权统治时代，当政的人们不会注意到这些问题，更不会认真进行水利工程建设。解放以后，在新疆的哈密、焉耆、阿克苏以及玛纳斯河流域各地，都兴建了很多的水利工程，在生产上发生了很大的作用。现在政府一面继续进行各种水利建设，一面又教导人民合理用水。新疆缺水的旧观念今天应该完全改变过来。
    过去人们以为新疆少雨少水，很多地方又都是沙漠，因而连带发生了许多片面的不正确的印象。有人以为新疆既然缺水，因而也就没有什么河流，殊不知新疆的大河多得很。不仅河流很多，而且还有很多湖沼（当地统称为海子）。这些河流一向都是两岸人民生活的命脉，不仅广大的农田靠它灌溉，其中很多地方将来还可以利用水力发电，以供工业动力和市民照明之用；有一部分河道将来整理以后还可以通航。有些人以为新疆既然少雨缺水，树木一定不多。其实，西起奇台、东迄伊犁，在天山阴面，迤逦千里，长着繁茂的云杉，这是新疆基本建设的主要木材来源。在一般城市和农村里，树木也很茂盛。在新疆，兄弟民族大都有种树的习惯，而且他们种起树来，都是一种十几里，或者一种几千株，既多且密。无论在牧区或农村，凡是有水的地方，都一定有树。尤其在戈壁滩上，要是你老远老远看到前面有树了，那地方也一定有水，有人家。在南疆和伊犁各地，很多人家家里都栽植果树。在新疆，人民在他们的生活里很明显地感受着种树的好处：取荫、架屋、烧柴和吃果子。当我在新疆各地旅行时，常常一路浓荫夹道，林色不绝。有一次在南疆旅行时，从拜城的县东到县西，沿着公路，延绵一百六七十华里，柳杨交植，没断过树。而伊宁的树木之盛，一色白杨，又是这一个祖国西陲名城的一大特色。
      同样，当有些人听我谈到新疆多鱼的时候，也都表示惊奇。他们以为新疆既是一片沙漠，哪儿还会有鱼？可是事实上，新疆的一些主要河流，大都产鱼。这一年里，我就先后吃过伊犁河、玛纳斯河、开都河、孔雀河、塔里木河以及阿克苏河等河里的鱼。阿尔泰山下的库额尔齐斯河，也以产鱼闻名。在乌鲁木齐，在鱼摊上我还看见有活鲫鱼卖。
    人们总以为新疆这地方穷苦。过去新疆人民的生活的确是很穷苦的，这主要是由于旧时代的封建反动政权的残酷压榨。实际上，新疆这地方不仅不穷，而且富得很。新疆地下的资源，虽然还没有进行大规模的勘测，还不能估计这些资源的数量，但是，新疆物藏之富，是可以肯定的事实。石油、煤、铁都有很大的蕴藏量，此外还有很多珍贵的有色金属。在农业方面，新疆的土地也是出奇的肥沃。今天中国好几种主要农产品的全国最高产量都是在新疆创造的。新疆的小麦生产最高达到每亩一千三百七十三斤、水稻最高每亩二千二百零五斤，棉花最高每亩一千三百四十九斤，这些高额丰产纪录虽然还只是在一些小面积上创造的，然而已经足够说明新疆土地的肥沃和它在农业生产上的潜力。在瓜果的生产方面，除了内地熟知的哈密瓜和吐鲁番葡萄以外，其他如梨、桃、杏、苹果、石榴、樱桃、无花果、西瓜、花生等，也无不既多且好。去夏我游伊犁时，一角钱可以买到五个苹果。今年初夏我在库车、阿克苏一带时，一角钱可以买到三十只杏子。这些还都是从市上小贩的手里购买的，要是直接到果园里买，还要便宜。据说在南疆有些地方，花两、三元就可以买一株桃树，树上结的桃子完全归你所有。除了少数热带瓜果以外，国内一般瓜果，在新疆大都能够见到。
    新疆又是我国的主要牧区之一。这儿有很多天然的优美的牧场。去年我在伊犁地区的尼勒克、新源、巩留、特克斯、昭苏一带旅行，双目所及，非绿即青。那像地毯一样的绿草，无头无尽地铺盖在所有的草原上和山坡上。一片青翠，一片碧绿；碧绿青翠以外，几乎再见不到第二种颜色。甚至连人们所呼吸的空气，也仿佛是“青色的空气”似的，特别清新透爽。乌鲁木齐的南山一带、巴音郭楞蒙族自治州的巴音布洛克一带以及阿尔泰山一带，都是无限美好的广大牧区。那些勤劳的牧民，就在这些高山草原上牧放着他们的牛羊。蒙古包、马奶子、冬不拉（乐器）、再加上那无限美丽的牧区山色和清新舒爽的高山气候，使得这些地区的牧民生活充满了诗一样的美丽色彩。
    这一年来，我在新疆走了大大小小二十多个地方。每到一个地方，在当地工作的汉族同志总是对我盛称当地如何如何的好——物产如何富饶，风景如何美丽，只要劳动就能创造幸福的生活，等等。这实际上反映了这样一种情况：没有来过新疆的人，受了旧的不正确的看法的影响，以为新疆这地方比较荒凉，没有什么引人之处，但是到了新疆，在新疆住定了下来的人们，又细细体会到新疆自有它的可爱可取之处，并深切感到这地方具有无限创造开发的可能。特别在解放以后这几年来，新疆在各方面都有很多新的改进和成就。在党和政府的积极的领导和帮助下，农业生产无论在改良种籽上、推广新式农具和新的耕作方法上，都有相当的成绩。驻新疆部队所建造的水利工程和部队的生产劳动，更给当地各族老乡以很大的帮助和启发。一九五四年吐鲁番农民种的棉花，在三万亩的大面积上达到每亩生产籽棉三百十四斤的纪录，就是一件了不起的事情。牧业方面，也有新的改进。牧民认识到政府推广的“新疆羊”，无论是毛、肉、乳，都比原来的土种羊好。在人工授精、接羔育羔以及割草搭棚过冬等各方面，牧民也得到了政府给予的各种必要的帮助。农牧生产的积极发展，再加上农牧产品价格的提高和工业产品价格的降低，就必然使新疆各族人民的生活得到很大的改善。各地的学校和入学人数普遍增加。医疗卫生事业和电影的放映，不仅已经到达了较小的城市，而且已经深入到较小的农村和偏僻的牧区，这在新疆历史上都是前所未有的事情。
    城市的面貌也有很大的变化。就以新疆的首府乌鲁木齐来说，这地方自从民国以来，被杨增新、金树仁、盛世才、国民党等前后统治了近四十年，直到快被解放的时候，依然还是一个“马路不平、电灯不明、电话不灵”的烂摊子。再没有比乌鲁木齐这样一个城市更容易使人明显地看出新旧时代的对比了。在这个城市里，凡是旧社会遗留下来的，几乎都是破烂的；凡是你现在所看到的一些新的整齐的建筑，都是解放以后这几年内建造起来的；新造的建筑大都装有现代化的卫生设备和暖气设备。道路和市容也有了很大的改进。目前乌鲁木齐的主要街道都已铺了沥青，并有了几条行驶公共汽车的市内交通干线。西郊明园一带，过去是一片荒滩，现在已经建设成为乌鲁木齐的一个相当现代化的新的市区。医院和剧场都有增加，它们的规模和设备都是头等的。而更重要的是乌鲁木齐这个城市在解放以后已经从一个消费城市转变为一个生产城市，而且使新疆历史上第一次有了现代工业：钢铁工业、机器制造工业、电力工业以及纺织工业等。这些现代工业正为发展新疆人民的生产和提高新疆人民的生活作出巨大的贡献。最近很多到达乌鲁木齐的外宾，看到在中国的西部边疆上有着这样一座相当现代化的城市，都表示惊奇。
    为着支援边疆的建设，这几年来，很多爱国的青年男女不断地从祖国各个角落来到新疆。无论在部队里、工厂里、矿山上以及城市里，我们经常会遇见很多说着山东口音、湖南口音和上海口音的年轻姑娘。她们的出现，标志着祖国各地人民对于新疆兄弟民族和新疆各项建设的关怀和支援；标志着新一代年青人的不畏艰苦、献身边陲的豪迈作风。我们的国家有着巨大的力量和决心来开发边疆、创造新的历史，把祖国的每一个角落都推进幸福的社会主义社会。
    毛主席的平等团结友爱互助的民族政策，这几年来在新疆取得了巨大的成就。汉族和各兄弟民族，大家融融洽洽，互信互助，的确像生活在一个大家庭中一样。这一年，我无论到什么地方去，甚至到最偏僻的小村，当地的兄弟民族都以无比的热情接待我，在工作上和生活上给我充分的帮助和照顾，谈谈笑笑，毫不生疏。他们把我看作一个来自祖国的首都，来自党中央和毛主席所在地的可敬的远客。（附图片）
