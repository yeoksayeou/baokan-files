Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 16th: The government of the Federal Republic of Germany held a meeting on the 15th. Chancellor Adenauer and Foreign Minister Brentano gave a detailed report on the process and results of the Moscow negotiations.

"Die Welt," in reporting on the reaction to Adenauer's report, emphasized that the vast majority of the cabinet is willing to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

According to "Die Welt," the chairmen of the parliamentary groups of the Bundestag are scheduled to convene a Bundestag meeting on September 22 to discuss foreign policy issues, primarily the results of the Federal Chancellor's negotiations in Moscow.

Xinhua News Agency: West German, Yugoslavian, and American newspapers continue to comment on the results of the Soviet and Federal Republic of Germany talks in Moscow.

The West German Social Democratic Party's "Neue Rhein Zeitung" published an article by its Moscow correspondent, Feddersen, entitled: "The Moscow Talks Should Be a Turning Point in Our Policy." Feddersen emphasized that West Germany's policy of "negotiating from a position of strength" suffered a crushing defeat in the Moscow talks. It was clear during the talks that a reunified Germany should not participate in NATO; Germany can only be reunified when Bonn and East Berlin consult and take joint measures before the major powers. The article stated that we are standing at a turning point in our policy, and the Social Democratic Party unreservedly supports the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The article pointed out that the issue of West Germany establishing contact with the German Democratic Republic cannot be postponed indefinitely; West Germany must discuss this issue and make a decision. The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" hoped that the establishment of normal relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union would end the distrust and suspicion that it has shown in its policy towards Eastern European countries. As for who achieved victory in Moscow, the newspaper emphasized that the answer should be that the easing of tensions was the victor.

The Yugoslavian "Borba" published an article stating that the Moscow agreement is a reflection of the new trend of mutual rapprochement and consultation. Any more practical solution to the German question should begin in this way. Experience has shown that realistic agreements, if they help to ease tensions, are usually beneficial. There are many reasons to believe that the results of the Soviet-West German talks are precisely this. Openly discussing opposing views, without fear that doing so will cause the talks to fail, is a manifestation of the Geneva spirit, and the results of the Moscow talks are a direct continuation of the Geneva achievements.

"The New York Times" correspondent in Washington, Abel, pointed out that American diplomats have different opinions on the results of the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. He wrote: "The State Department has decided not to publicize its unease about the Moscow agreement between Adenauer and Bulganin." According to Abel, Assistant Secretary of State Merchant visited Adenauer a few days before the Federal Republic of Germany delegation visited Moscow and received assurances that West Germany would not rashly exchange ambassadors with the Soviet Union, but would insist on "limited contact through diplomatic agencies." "The New York Herald Tribune" reporter Koblenz reported from Bonn that the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union has been widely welcomed and supported by many critics. According to Koblenz, Adenauer took this action against the advice of Foreign Minister Brentano and the other two important members of the delegation, who were "concerned" about the American "reaction to the establishment of diplomatic relations."

    西德政府举行会议听取阿登纳总理的报告
    西德、南、美等国报纸继续评论苏联和西德的会谈结果
    新华社十七日讯  据塔斯社柏林十六日讯：德意志联邦共和国政府十五日举行了会议，总理阿登纳和外交部长勃伦塔诺作了关于莫斯科谈判的过程和结果的详细报告。
    “世界报”在报道对阿登纳报告的反应时着重指出，内阁中的绝大多数愿意同苏联建立外交关系。
    据“世界报”报道，联邦议院各党团主席订于九月二十二日召开联邦议院会议，讨论外交政策问题，首先是讨论联邦总理在莫斯科谈判的结果。
    据新华社讯  西德、南斯拉夫和美国的报纸继续评论苏联和德意志联邦共和国在莫斯科会谈的结果。
    西德社会民主党的“新莱因报”刊载了驻莫斯科特派记者费德森的一篇文章，题目是：“莫斯科会谈应当成为我们的政策的一个转折点”。费德森强调说，西德奉行的“凭借实力地位”的政策在莫斯科会谈中遭到了惨败。在会谈中可以清楚地看出：一个重新统一的德国不应当参加北大西洋公约组织；只有当波恩和东柏林进行协商并且在大国面前采取共同措施的时候，德国才可能重新统一。文章说，我们是站在我国政策的转折点上，社会民主党毫无保留地支持同苏联建立外交关系。文章指出，西德同德意志民主共和国建立接触的问题也不可能无限期地加以搁置，西德必须讨论这个问题并且作出决定。“法兰克福环球报”希望西德同苏联建立正常关系将终止它对东欧国家政策中所表现的那种不信任和猜疑。至于谁在莫斯科取得了胜利，报纸着重说，答案应当是紧张局势的缓和取得了胜利。
    南斯拉夫“战斗报”发表文章说，莫斯科协议是互相接近和协商这种新的趋向的反映。任何一种比较切实的解决德国问题的办法都应该以这样的方式开始。经验表明：实事求是的协议，如果这些协议有助于和缓的话，通常都是有益的。有不少根据可以确信：苏联和西德会谈的结果正是这样。开诚布公地倾谈相反的看法，不必担心这样做会使会谈失败，这是日内瓦精神的表现，而莫斯科会谈的结果正是日内瓦成就的直接继续。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者阿伯尔指出：美国外交家对苏联和德意志联邦共和国的谈判结果各有不同的意见。他写道：“国务院决定不宣扬它对阿登纳和布尔加宁之间的莫斯科协议的不安。”据阿伯尔说，美国助理国务卿麦钱特在德意志联邦共和国代表团赴莫斯科访问前几天曾经访问阿登纳，并且得到了保证：西德不会冒失地同苏联互派大使，但是将坚持“通过外交代理机构进行有限的接触”。“纽约先驱论坛报”记者柯布伦兹从波恩报道，同苏联建立外交关系受到许多批评家的广泛的欢迎和支持。据柯布伦兹说，阿登纳不接受外交部长勃伦塔诺和代表团的其他两个重要团员的劝说而采取了这个行动，后者“担心着”美国“对建立外交关系”的反应。
