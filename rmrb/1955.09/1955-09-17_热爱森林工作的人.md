    A Person Who Loves Forest Work
    Lin Lai

    In the forest area of the Greater Khingan Mountains in Northeast China, it often snows heavily, and everywhere there are forests so tall that you can't see the sky. In winter, it's all a vast expanse of white. Here, the temperature is often minus 40 degrees Celsius, and the rivers are covered with thick ice. In such a harsh season, Comrade Wang Shouhai, a scaler from the Tulihe Forest Industry Bureau, works tirelessly in the logging areas, lumberyards, and storage yards, diligently inspecting and grading the timber after harvesting and processing, according to national timber standards, stamping marks, and calculating the volume based on the scaling results.

    Wang Shouhai came to the forest area in the winter of 1952. When he first arrived, seeing such dense forests and such heavy snow, and sleeping in leaky and drafty workers' barracks, sometimes with bedding frozen to the walls, he had to go up the mountain with the workers as soon as it was light and didn't return until sunset. Therefore, Wang Shouhai had ideological fluctuations, and he felt that this work was too difficult. After learning about his ideological situation, the Party organization and administrative leaders in the forest area promptly educated him and other scalers, making him realize the prospects of working in the forest area and understand the importance of scaling work: as long as the scalers' scaling work couldn't keep up, it would affect the completion of production tasks; if the scalers mistakenly graded first-class materials as second-class materials, it would cause losses to state property. This strengthened his courage and confidence to overcome difficulties.

    The construction site of the Jinchang Forestry Team was a fourth-class, seventh-grade forest farm after "plucking the big hairs" [Note]. The wood in the forest farm was scattered, and the scaling required a long walk. Moreover, to get to this forest farm, one had to pass through fallen trees lying across the road and "big-head fragrant" saplings along the way. The branches and leaves of these "big-head fragrant" saplings were very sharp, often scratching his hands and clothes. However, Wang Shouhai was not intimidated by these difficulties and went to the site with the workers every day at dawn. When he was busy with work, he would just eat some cold rice on the site; when he was thirsty, he would eat some snow. Back at the dormitory, he still had to calculate accounts and reconcile accounts, ending the day's work.

    When he first arrived in the forest area, Wang Shouhai, like other new comrades, did not know how to use the marking hammer or keep accounts; but he was determined to learn if he didn't know how, and he learned from the old scalers. Although his dormitory was more than half a kilometer away from where the old scaler Zhong Changsheng lived, neither wind nor snow stopped him from going there to study. Because he understood: only by studying well can he work well. After studying, he could work, but his work efficiency was not high, and he could only scale more than 30 cubic meters of wood per day, and he had to calculate even a little bit of the accounts until late at night. When he saw Zhong Changsheng calculating the scaling field accounts quickly and without any errors without looking at the "volume table", he asked Zhong Changsheng to teach him. Zhong Changsheng told him: "Memorize the volume numbers, and you will know them over time." After returning, he made up his mind: he must quickly learn Zhong Changsheng's skills. After that, whenever he had free time, he would memorize the "volume table", sometimes even memorizing it while lying in bed; he also often worked with other scalers to study how to do a good job. After a year of hard study, he skillfully mastered the scaling techniques, and the amount of wood he scaled every day reached more than 100 cubic meters, and he could also calculate the volume numbers without looking at the "volume table". Therefore, other scalers called him "living volume". Under his influence, six scalers in his workshop also became "living volumes".

    The scaler's marking hammer can determine the fate of the wood. Each scaler has to scale an average of more than 30,000 cubic meters of wood per year. If one cubic meter of first-class material is graded as second-class material, the state will lose 40 yuan. This requires the scaler to have a high sense of responsibility. Conversely, if the scaler is slightly negligent and hammers marks randomly, wrongly determining the grade of the wood, it will cause great losses to the state. Therefore, scaling work is an important task related to whether or not the state plan can be completed in a comprehensive and balanced manner according to material types and specifications. Among the scalers, the slogan "A hammer mark, worth thousands of gold" is also widely popular. Wang Shouhai understands these principles very deeply, so every time he goes to work with a work team, he first learns about the logging situation in the mountain area and educates the workers to reasonably process the materials. When he picks up the hammer and stamps the wood, he carefully looks at how many live and dead knots the wood has, whether it has bends or other problems, and then stamps the mark. Therefore, his work has always been good.

    Wang Shouhai also firmly remembers this sentence: "A Communist Youth League member should not only do his job well, but also lead the masses to jointly do a good job in production." Therefore, he pays great attention to the workers' ideological situation and production situation, often assisting the work team leader in publicizing the state's forestry production policies, domestic and international affairs, and fire prevention, security, and hygiene work to the workers. He also uses his free time to read newspapers to the workers, help the bookkeepers calculate accounts, and actively puts forward rationalization proposals to the leadership for improving the work. When he comes into contact with the workers, he always persuades people with reason in everything and has a kind attitude, so everyone is very willing to approach him. When the Liu Shaowu work team was first established, many new workers did not understand production technology and could not even tie rope knots, so he suggested that nine old workers be assigned to each group to serve as technical instructors. He found that among these nine old workers, some had the wrong idea of "not making money, just worrying," so he assisted the work team leader in educating them, making them consciously and voluntarily take on this work. As a result, under the guidance of the old workers, the new workers quickly learned production techniques, and there were few accidents in production. But later he discovered that some workers thought that they were earning fixed wages, and even if the production tasks were not completed, their wages would not be deducted, so they were sloppy in their work. A bullock cart should pull four portions of wood, but they only pulled two portions. When others asked them, they said: "Our work team is just an old bull and a broken cart with a lumpy harness, so just pull a little!" This affected the timber collection from reaching the quota. In addition to reflecting this situation to the work team leader, Wang Shouhai also actively publicized the importance of completing tasks to the workers; at the same time, he used various methods to improve the workers' political consciousness and production enthusiasm, so that this team increased from importing 60 to 70 cubic meters of wood per day to more than 100 cubic meters, and completed the task ahead of schedule every month, and was rated as a model work team of the entire Forest Industry Bureau. After the superiors issued a call for increasing production and practicing economy, he saw that the feeders of this work team were wasting grass, so he discussed with the work team leader and strengthened the education of the feeders. As a result, the feed for each cow was reduced from 30 pounds to 23 pounds per day, saving the state more than 4,960 yuan in four months.

    Wang Shouhai resolutely struggles against those who violate the policies of the Party and the state or violate labor discipline. Once, Wang Shouhai went to a work team to provide support. When inspecting the mountain site, he found that a scaler casually graded waste materials as qualified materials, and conversely graded qualified materials as waste materials. He raised his opinion, and the work team held another meeting to criticize this scaler. But this scaler did not accept the criticism. After the meeting, Wang Shouhai talked to him individually, explained the importance of scaling work to him, and worked with him to determine the specifications of the wood, helping him to change his work style. Another worker claimed that the scaled wood was only recently pulled by himself and asked for it to be scaled. Wang Shouhai immediately exposed this deception and used it to educate other workers.

    For more than three years, because of his love for his scaling work, his meticulous treatment of the state's wealth, and his close ties with the masses, he has made significant achievements in his work. The Party and the masses have given him the honor he deserves: he has been selected as an active worker seven times, and twice selected as a labor model of the Tulihe Forest Industry Bureau. The Tulihe Forest Industry Bureau Youth League Committee and the Second Congress of the Inner Mongolia Youth League have also rewarded him.

    热爱森林工作的人
    林来
    祖国东北大兴安岭的林区，常常下着鹅毛大雪，到处都是抬头看不见天的森林。冬天，尽是一片白茫茫的世界。在这里，气温常是摄氏零下四十度，河里结着厚厚的冰。就在这样严寒的季节里，图里河森林工业局的检尺员王守海同志，奔走在山场、楞场和贮木场上，进行着紧张的劳动，他认真地按照国家颁布的木材规格的标准，对采伐造材后的木材进行检尺和品等区分，加盖号印，再根据检尺结果，计算材积。
    王守海是一九五二年冬天到林区的。初来的时候，看到这样茂密的大森林，这样大的风雪；晚上睡的又是透风漏雪的工铺，有时被褥和墙冻在一起；早上，天一亮就跟着工人上山，直到太阳落山才回来，因此，王守海思想上是有过波动的，他曾感到这个工作太困难了。林区的党组织和行政领导同志在了解了他的思想情况以后，及时地对他和其他的检尺员进行了教育，使他认清了在林区工作的前途，懂得了检尺工作的重要性：只要检尺员的检尺工作跟不上，就会影响生产任务的完成；只要检尺员在检尺时，错把一等材料打成了二等材，就会给国家财产造成损失。这样，增强了他克服困难的勇气和信心。
    金昌林工队的工地是经过“拔大毛”〔注〕的四等七级林场，林场的木头分散，检尺时要跑很远的路。而且去这个林场时，还得穿过横在路上的倒木和沿路的“大头香”小树。这种“大头香”小树的枝叶很厉害，时常划破他的手和衣服。可是，王守海并没有被这些困难吓倒，每天天一亮就跟着工人一起上场。工作忙，就在场上吃点冷饭；口渴，就吃点雪。回到宿舍，他还得算账，对账，结束一天的工作。
    初到林区时，王守海和其他新来的同志一样，不知道怎样打号锤、记账；但是他抱着不会就学的决心，向老检尺员学习。虽然他的宿舍离老检尺员钟长胜住的地方有一里多地，但是不论刮风下雪，都没有挡住他去那里学习。因为他懂得：只有学习好，才能工作得好。经过学习，他可以工作了，但是工作效率不高，每天只能检尺三十多立方公尺的木材，一点点账也得算到深夜。当他看见钟长胜不看
  “材积表”，很快就把检尺野账毫无差错地算出来时，就要求钟长胜教他。钟长胜告诉他：“把材积数字记在脑子里，天长日久就会了。”回来后，他就下了决心：一定要很快学会钟长胜的本领。以后他只要有空，就背“材积表”，有时躺在床上还要背；他还经常同别的检尺员一起研究如何做好工作。经过一年的苦心学习，他熟练地掌握了检尺技术，每天检尺木材的数量达到了一百多立方公尺，并且一样可以不看“材积表”，就能算出材积数字来。因此，别的检尺员都叫他“活材积”。在他的影响下，他所在的车间有六名检尺员也成了“活材积”。
    检尺员的号锤可以决定木材的命运。每个检尺员每年平均要检尺三万多立方公尺的木材，一立方公尺的一等材如果被打成了二等材，国家就得损失四十元。这样，就要求检尺员有高度的责任心。相反的，如果检尺员稍有疏忽大意，乱打号锤，错定了木材的等级，就会给国家造成很大的损失。因此，检尺工作是关系到能否按材种规格，全面均衡地完成国家计划的重要任务。在检尺员当中也普遍地流行着“号锤一响，黄金万两”的口号。王守海对这些道理是理解得很深刻的，所以他每到一个工队工作，首先就要了解山场造材的情况，教育工人合理造材。在他拿起号锤往木头上打号印时，他要好好地看看这棵木材的活结、死结有多少，是否有弯度或其他毛病，然后再打上号印。因此，他的工作一直是好的。
    王守海还牢牢地记着这样一句话：“一个青年团员不但要把自己担负的工作做好，并且要带动群众，共同搞好生产。”因此，他非常注意工人的思想情况和生产情况，经常协助工队队长向工人宣传国家的林业生产方针、国内外大事以及防火、保安和卫生工作等。他还利用空闲时间给工人读报，帮助记账员算账，并且积极地向领导上提出改进工作的合理化建议。他在同工人同志接触的时候，总是事事以理服人，态度和蔼，因而大家都很愿意同他接近。刘绍武工队刚成立时，很多新工人不懂生产技术，连绳扣也不会结，他就建议把九名老工人分配到各组担任技术指导工作。他发现在这九名老工人中，有人有“不挣钱，白操心”的错误思想，就协助工队长进行了教育，使他们自觉自愿地担负起这个工作。结果新工人在老工人的指导下，很快就学会了生产技术，在生产中很少发生事故。但是以后他又发现，有的工人以为挣的是固定工资，生产任务完不成，也不会扣工资，因而便在工作时马马虎虎，一个牛车应该拉四分木材，只拉二分，别人问他们时就说：“咱们工队反正是老牛破车疙疸套，拉点就行呗！”影响了集材达不到定额。王守海除把这个情况反映给工队队长以外，还积极地向工人宣传完成任务的重要性；同时，用各种方法去提高工人的政治觉悟和生产积极性，使这个队由每天进材六、七十立方公尺提高到一百多立方公尺，月月超额完成了任务，被评为全森林工业局的模范工队。在上级发出增产节约号召以后，他看见这个工队的饲养工喂草有糟蹋现象，就同工队长研究，加强了对饲养工的教育，结果每天每头牛的草料由三十斤减到二十三斤，四个月就为国家节约了四千九百六十多元。
    对于违反党和国家政策或违反劳动纪律的人，王守海是进行坚决斗争的。有一次王守海到一个工队去支援，在检查山场时，发现有个检尺员马马虎虎地把废材打成了合格材，把合格材反而打成了废材，他就提出意见，工队又开会对这个检尺员进行了批评。但是这个检尺员不接受批评。会后王守海就找他个别谈话，向他说明了检尺工作的重要性，并且和他一起确定木材的规格，帮助他转变了工作作风。另一个工人，把已检尺的木头说成是自己才拉来的，要求检尺。王守海立即揭发了这种欺骗行为，并且用它来教育其他工人。
    三年多来，由于他这样热爱自己的检尺工作，一丝不苟地对待国家的财富，同群众保持紧密的联系，他在工作上作出了显著的成绩。党和群众给了他应得的荣誉：七次评选他为积极工作者，两次选他为图里河森林工业局的劳动模范。图里河森林工业局青年团委和青年团内蒙古第二次代表大会也都对他进行了奖励。
