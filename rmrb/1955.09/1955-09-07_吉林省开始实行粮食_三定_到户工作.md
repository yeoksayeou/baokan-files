Jilin Province Begins Implementing Grain "Three Fixes" to Households

    (Our report) Jilin Province's first batch of 1,900 villages have successively begun the work of implementing the grain "Three Fixes" to households. As of August 30th, the grain "Three Fixes" work had been completed in 123 villages and 7 districts throughout the province. The province-wide "Three Fixes" to households work will be completed in batches before the end of October.

    In the villages where the "Three Fixes" to households have been implemented, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has generally increased. Many farmers reflect that after the implementation of the "Three Fixes," households with surplus grain have a bottom line, and households short of grain are reassured. After the Youjia Village of Liuhe County completed the "Three Fixes" to households work, three agricultural production cooperatives, including "Rising Sun," accumulated more than 650 cartloads of green manure in six days. The whole village plans to raise more than 200 additional pigs in addition to the existing 300 pigs.

    In the process of conducting pilot projects of the grain "Three Fixes" to households work, the counties of Jilin Province have trained more than 43,000 county, district, and village staff through training courses, preparing cadres for the gradual unfolding of the work. The province has also transferred more than 100 staff members from government departments to various places to provide specific guidance on the "Three Fixes" to households work.

    吉林省开始实行粮食“三定”到户工作
    本报讯　吉林省第一批一千九百个村粮食“三定”到户工作已先后开始。到八月三十日止，全省已经有一百二十三个村及七个区的粮食“三定”到户工作结束。到十月底以前，全省“三定”到户工作将分批完成。
    已经进行“三定”到户的村，群众生产情绪普遍高涨，许多农民反映：实行“三定”后，余粮户有了底，缺粮户定了心。柳河县油家村完成“三定”到户工作后，“太阳升”等三个农业生产合作社，在六天内就积绿肥六百五十多车。全村计划除养好现有的三百多头猪外，还要增养二百多头。
    吉林省各县在进行粮食“三定”到户工作试点过程中，已通过训练班训练了县、区、村工作人员四万三千多人，为逐步展开工作准备了干部。省里还抽调了一百多名机关工作人员分赴各地具体指导“三定”到户工作。
