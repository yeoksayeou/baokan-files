    Yang Baojiang and His Coal Mining Third Shift
    Shu Tao

    Yang Baojiang is the leader of the Third Shift of the Sixth Coal Mining District of the Fushun Mining Bureau's Laohutai Mine. Under his leadership, the Coal Mining Third Shift completed the first half of this year's production task forty-one days ahead of schedule, exceeding the production quota by 15,561 tons of raw coal, and basically achieved safe production.

    Yang Baojiang is good at grasping the key issues in his work, summarizing experience, or learning from lessons. In January of this year, the Coal Mining Third Shift did not complete its production task, and everyone developed a mood of mutual complaint. The workers blamed the technical personnel, the later shift complained that the previous shift did not prepare the conditions, the coal miners complained that the carpenters did not build the supports in time, and the carpenters complained that the blasters and drillers delayed the supports. That night, Yang Baojiang carefully analyzed these words, and the next day he convened a production meeting. He first examined the shortcomings in the班's labor organization and technical management, and guided everyone to carefully calculate the daily working hours, discovering that the main reason for not completing the production task was that the production preparation work was not done well enough. Every day, after the coal miners went down the well, they had to wait one or two hours before they could start production, and the waiting time was even longer when the work face conditions were not good. Therefore, everyone conducted research targeting this problem and decided that workers in the four work types of blasting, drilling, support, and chute would enter the well one hour early to do a good job of production preparation. A strict division of labor was carried out, specific measures for the previous shift to create conditions for the next shift were stipulated, and the shift handover system was strictly enforced. After doing this, regular cycles were realized, and the specifications of the work face were maintained. Then, with everyone's joint efforts, the advanced experiences of "leaving holes, leaving yellow mud, leaving pit wood" were created, as well as a new record for coal miners extracting coal within ten minutes of entering the well.

    Yang Baojiang pays great attention to cultivating technical strength and promoting advanced experience. In the past, each worker in the Third Shift only knew one skill, but the skills of all the workers in the班, put together, constituted a complete set of coal mining techniques. In order to gradually cultivate all the workers in the班 into technical talents capable of mastering the complete set of coal mining skills, Yang Baojiang decided to use pre-shift meetings for technical education. He also, based on the characteristics of the old workers having production technology and experience, and the new workers having high production enthusiasm, mobilized more than fifty new and old workers to sign mutual learning contracts. In the past six months, more than 50 percent of the workers in the班 have learned the skills of coal mining, support, and blasting.

    Yang Baojiang attaches great importance to promoting advanced experiences. This year, the leadership transferred Pang Guanxiang, a worker from the Third Shift, to study deep-hole drilling techniques. After returning to the班, he began to experiment. The first time, he failed because the angle was not found correctly. Some workers said sarcastically: "A blind man lighting a lamp is a waste of wax." Some also said: "Even the technicians can't do it, and he still wants to show off." Pang Guanxiang felt a little discouraged after hearing these words. At this time, Yang Baojiang convened a production meeting to analyze the reasons for this failure, and criticized the erroneous understanding of some workers, encouraging Pang Guanxiang to continue the experiment, and personally helping him. As a result, the experiment was successful, creating a new record of producing 11,100 tons of coal per month and 580 tons of coal per day at a 40-meter work face.

    "Taking crude censure and merely punitive measures against workers who are progressing slowly will not achieve the due effect." This is a phrase Yang Baojiang often says. He often conducts patient education of relatively backward workers and helps solve the key problems hindering their progress. For example, the carpenter Feng Zhanlu had very good skills, but he just didn't work hard. Every month, besides absenteeism and taking leave, he worked for less than half a month. After being transferred to work in the Third Shift, Yang Baojiang paid attention to strengthening his education, and went to the residential group to understand his family situation, learning that Feng Zhanlu was fond of squandering money. After getting his salary, he would spend it all in three days, and when he could no longer maintain his life, he would quarrel with his wife at home. After understanding these situations, Yang Baojiang talked to Feng Zhanlu, soliciting his opinions on production and leadership. Old Feng said: "The money earned is not enough to eat, I don't want to do it anymore." Yang Baojiang helped him to carefully calculate the family accounts, proving that if he didn't squander, he could live a good life. After this calculation, Feng Zhanlu understood that the family's financial difficulties were due to his own squandering and felt very ashamed. Yang Baojiang knew that Old Feng's family had no food, so he mobilized the workers to lend him ten yuan from the bonus for recovering pit wood. Old Feng said moved: "Section Chief Yang is too thoughtful, I must work hard in production in the future to be worthy of him and everyone." Since then, Old Feng began to actively produce.

    Yang Baojiang often relies on Party members, Youth League members, and activists to solve difficulties in production. In the first half of this year, the working environment of the Third Shift was very bad, with broken roof lines, averaging one every meter. If the support work was not done well, it was easy for roof collapses to occur. Therefore, it was necessary to ensure the timely supply of pit wood. Originally, the Third Shift had four workers transporting pit wood, but they only transported seventy roots in eight hours, and they were always unable to supply enough. They also often complained, demanding more people. In order to solve this problem, Yang Baojiang convened a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and activists to conduct research. Everyone unanimously believed that the reason for the insufficient supply of pit wood was not the lack of people, but the poor work attitude of the transport workers. Therefore, Party member Liu Dianren and activist Bai Lianchen signed up to help transport pit wood. As a result, they transported ninety roots in four hours the first time, and another 110 roots in five hours the second time. These facts educated the transport workers, and from then on, the supply of pit wood could be guaranteed.

    Yang Baojiang and his coal mining班 created the highest record in the entire mine. The leadership has repeatedly praised them, and now they have become a model for workers throughout the mine to learn from.

    杨宝江和他的采煤第三班
    舒陶
    杨宝江是抚顺矿务局老虎台矿采煤六区三班的班长。在他的领导下，采煤三班提前四十一天完成了今年上半年的生产任务，超额生产了一万五千五百六十一吨原煤，而且基本上作到了安全生产。
    杨宝江善于抓住工作中的关键问题，总结经验或吸取教训。今年一月，采煤三班没有完成生产任务，大家就产生了互相埋怨的情绪，工人说是技术人员的责任，后一班埋怨前一班不给准备条件，采煤工埋怨木工搭棚子不及时，木工埋怨放炮工和打眼工耽误了棚棚子。当天晚上，杨宝江把这些话作了仔细的分析，第二天就召开了一个生产会议。他首先检查了班里劳动组织和技术管理中的缺点，并引导大家仔细地计算了每天的工作时间，发现没有完成生产任务的主要原因是生产准备工作做得不够，每天采煤工人下井后，要等一、二个小时才能开始生产，遇到掌子情况不好时，等的时间就更长。于是大家针对这个问题进行研究，决定放炮、打眼、支柱、溜子等四个工种的工人提前一小时入井做好生产准备工作，进行了严密的分工，规定了上一班为下一班创造条件的具体办法，严格了交接班制度。这样做了以后，实现了正规循环，保持了掌子的规格。接着又在大家的共同努力下，创造了“留眼、留黄泥、留坑木”的先进经验和采煤工人入井十几分钟就出煤的新纪录。
    杨宝江非常注意培养技术力量和推广先进经验。过去，三班的工人每人只会一样技术，但全班工人的技术放在一起就是一套完整的采煤技术。杨宝江为了把全班工人都逐渐培养成能掌握全套采煤本领的技术人材，就决定利用坑前会进行技术教育。他又根据老工人有生产技术和经验，新工人有很高的生产热情的特点，动员了五十多名新老工人签订互学合同。半年来，全班百分之五十以上的工人都学会了采煤、支柱和放炮的本领。
    杨宝江很重视推广先进经验。今年，领导上调三班工人庞观祥去学习深打眼的技术。回班后，就开始试验。第一次由于角度没有找对，失败了。有些工人就讲怪话说：“瞎子点灯白费蜡。”也有的说：“技术员都搞不成，他还想露一手。”庞观祥听了这些话有点灰心。这时，杨宝江就召开生产会议，分析这次失败的原因，并批判了某些工人的错误认识，鼓励庞观祥继续试验，并亲自帮助，结果试验成功，创造了四十公尺掌子月产一万一千一百吨煤、日产五百八十吨煤的新纪录。
    “对进步较慢的工人采取生硬的指责和用单纯的惩办方法是达不到应有的效果的”。这是杨宝江经常说的一句话。他经常对较落后的工人进行耐心的教育，并帮助解决阻碍他们进步的关键问题。如木工冯占禄技术很好，就是不好好干活，每月除了旷工和请假，工作不到半个月。调到三班工作后，杨宝江就注意对他加强教育，并到居民组去了解他的家庭情况，知道冯占禄好乱花钱，拿到工资后三天光，生活无法维持了就在家同老婆吵架。了解了这些情况以后，杨宝江就找冯占禄谈话，征求他对生产和领导上的意见。老冯说：“挣的钱不够吃，不想干了。”杨宝江帮助他细算了一下家庭账，证明如果不是乱花，生活可以过得很好。经过这样一算，冯占禄明白了家庭生活困难是由于自己乱花钱，感到很惭愧。杨宝江知道老冯家里没粮食，就动员工人们在回收坑木的奖金中借给他十元。老冯感动地说：“杨班长作的太周到了，我今后在生产上一定好好干，才对得起他和大家。”从此以后，老冯就开始积极生产了。
    杨宝江经常依靠党员、团员和积极分子解决生产中的困难。今年上半年，三班的工作环境很不好，顶板断线，平均一公尺就有一个，如果支柱工作做得不好，很容易发生顶板坍下来的事故，因此，必须保证坑木的及时供应。原来三班有四个工人运坑木，八小时只运七十根，总是供应不上，他们还经常叫苦，要求增加人。为了解决这个问题，杨宝江召开了党员、团员、宣传员和积极分子会进行研究，大家一致认为坑木供应不上不是人少，而是运行工人的工作态度不好。于是党员刘殿仁、积极分子白连臣报名要求帮助运坑木，结果他们第一次在四小时内运了九十根，第二次又在五小时内运了一百一十根。这些事实教育了运行工人，从此坑木就能保证供应了。
    杨宝江和他的采煤班在生产上创造了全矿的最高纪录，领导上屡次表扬他们，现在他们已成为全矿工人学习的榜样。
