The friendly cooperation, economic exchanges, and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese people are being strengthened and developed daily. The picture shows Premier Zhou Enlai of China receiving the delegation of Japanese journalists and broadcasters.

At the invitation of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society to Japan, led by the head of the delegation Li Dequan and the deputy head Liao Chengzhi, paid a friendly visit to Japan in October 1954. The picture shows the head of the Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan, Li Dequan (right), handing over a list of Japanese war criminals remaining in China to the President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, Tadatsugu Shimazu, during a visit to the Japanese Red Cross Society.

Strengthening cultural exchanges and extensively developing trade relations between China and Japan in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit is the common aspiration of the people of both countries. At the invitation of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan, led by the head of the delegation Lei Renmin, visited Japan in March 1955. The picture shows fifteen Japanese organizations jointly holding a meeting in Tokyo on April 2 to welcome the Chinese Trade Delegation to Japan.

In the spirit of humanitarianism, the Chinese Red Cross provides various conveniences to Japanese nationals in China who wish to return to their country. By the end of March 1955, it had assisted approximately 29,000 Japanese nationals who wished to return to Japan. The picture shows returning Japanese nationals bidding farewell to those who saw them off as they left Tanggu New Port on the "Xing'an Maru."
