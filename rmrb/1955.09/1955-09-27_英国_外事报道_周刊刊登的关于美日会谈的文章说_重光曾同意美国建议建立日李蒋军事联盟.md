Xinhua News Agency, September 26th dispatch from London: The British "Foreign Report" weekly published an article on the US-Japan Washington talks on September 22nd, stating that Tokyo's repeated denials of the possibility that Shigemitsu葵 and Dulles discussed sending Japanese troops abroad are not convincing. The magazine said that, unofficially, news from Tokyo constantly suggests that not only is there a possibility of sending Japanese troops abroad, but also the possibility of expanding the US-Japan "Security Treaty" to include other Asian countries.

"Foreign Report" said that Dulles had proposed the establishment of an alliance between Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea during the US-Japan talks, and Shigemitsu葵 "had already expressed his agreement."

Prior to this, when Kyodo News reported on the scope of Japan's troop deployment abroad, it also said: the Japanese "Foreign Ministry believes it should at least include South Korea and Taiwan."

Xinhua News Agency, September 25th dispatch from Tokyo: According to the policy of "the Self-Defense Forces should also study atomic and hydrogen bombs" as stated by Shigemasa Sunada, the Japanese "Defense Agency" has established a special organization to study the effects of atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions, etc. At the same time, special research classes have been newly established in some military schools to conduct research on atomic warfare.

    英国“外事报道”周刊刊登的关于美日会谈的文章说
    重光曾同意美国建议建立日李蒋军事联盟
    新华社二十六日讯　伦敦消息：英国“外事报道”周刊在九月二十二日登载了一篇关于美日华盛顿会谈的文章说，东京再三否认重光葵和杜勒斯讨论了派遣日本军队出国的可能性的语气，是不能令人相信的。这个杂志说，在非官方方面，东京不断传出的消息暗示：不仅存在着派遣日本军队出国的可能性，而且还存在着可能扩大美日“安全条约”而将其他亚洲国家包括在内的可能性。
    “外事报道”说，杜勒斯在日美会谈中曾经提出了成立日本、台湾和南朝鲜联盟的建议，重光葵“已经表示同意”。
    在这以前，日本共同社在报道日本派兵出国的范围时也说：日本“外务省认为至少包括韩国和台湾”。
    新华社二十五日讯　东京消息：日本“防卫厅”根据砂田重政所说的“自卫队也要研究原子弹和氢弹”的方针，已经设立了一个专门机构，来研究原子弹和氢弹的爆炸效果等问题；同时，还在一些军事学校里新设立了特别研究班，进行研究原子战争的工作。
