This time, our Japanese Diet delegation, at the invitation of Mr. Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Mr. Peng Zhen, Secretary-General, has come to the capital of your country, Beijing, from Guangzhou via Hong Kong, to attend your country's National Day celebrations. Here, we express our deep gratitude for the care and hospitality shown by your country in all respects.

We respectfully admire your country's efforts to build a new China with the concerted efforts of the whole nation, and we wish the construction of the new China an early success.

At present, the relationship between Japan and China is very unnatural, which is truly regrettable.

However, we firmly believe that as contact between the peoples of the two countries continues to increase, relations between the two countries will gradually return to normal; the day when the two countries join hands to contribute to world peace and human culture is not far off.

Finally, we are deeply grateful for the welcome we received from many important figures in your country upon our arrival in your country's capital. We once again express our sincere respect and gratitude for your invitation, and we wish the entire Chinese people prosperity and happiness.

At the banquet, Peng Zhen said in his speech that he firmly believes that this visit to China by members of the Japanese House of Representatives and House of Councillors will help promote and develop friendly cooperation, trade exchanges, cultural exchanges, and the early normalization of relations between China and Japan. He also proposed a toast to the early normalization of relations between China and Japan, to safeguarding lasting peace in the Far East and the world, and to the visit of Japanese friends to China.

Eikichi Kamabayashi, head of the Japanese Diet Delegation, then delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude for the invitation from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, the highest organ of power in the new China, to visit China and participate in the National Day of the new China. He said that Japan and China are neighboring countries, and various issues between the two countries should be resolved as soon as possible. More mutual exchanges between the peoples of the two countries will help solve these problems. He stated that the delegation will also work towards this goal. Finally, he proposed a toast to the grand and successful completion of the National Day celebrations of the new China, and to the happiness and prosperity of the people of the new China.
