    At the Meeting of Soviet and West German Government Delegations on September 10
    Speech by Khrushchev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR

    I would like to express some opinions on the speeches of Federal Chancellor Adenauer and Foreign Minister Brentano. Mr. Adenauer said that the Soviet army seemed to have behaved recklessly when it advanced on German territory. We firmly deny this. The Soviet Union continued to pursue the aggressors after driving them out of our territory because they did not surrender. If our army had not pursued them, the enemy would have regrouped and attacked again. Therefore, the Soviet army could not stop halfway; it had to achieve its goal—to eliminate the enemy. Soviet soldiers continued the war imposed on them by the German fascists and eliminated the enemy, shedding their own blood and fulfilling their sacred duty to their people. Is this recklessness? If an army of any country attacked Germany, and the German army turned from defense to offense, could this be called recklessness? This is the sacred duty of the people. Therefore, I believe that this statement is an insult to the Soviet army. This is the first point I have to make.
    In their speeches, the Federal Republic's Chancellor and Foreign Minister said that many families have no news of their loved ones. We understand the pain of these families—parents, wives, and children. However, you should have the courage to point out the real culprit. Who is responsible for the fact that many breadwinners and relatives did not return home? This is the disaster brought about by Hitler and his gang. If the Germans sacrificed a lot, then the Soviet people sacrificed even more. Who should we ask for answers? Some Italian politicians (the Soviet Union never attacked Italy) are now asking us why many Italian soldiers who attacked us with the German fascists did not return home. They ask: Where are our soldiers? These soldiers are buried in Soviet soil.
    We did not start the war, so we are not guilty of the fact that many people did not return home. The sacrifice of millions of people should be a warning so that this tragedy will not be repeated in the future. If anyone tries to repeat what Hitler did, then it will end the same way, or even more tragically.
    I hope that the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany understand me correctly. We should discuss issues frankly and sincerely in a calm manner. In negotiations, we should not be angry, let alone seek revenge. Anger and revenge are bad advisors, and they will never lead to the right solutions. We should understand this. Of course, we cannot completely forget the past, but when solving problems, we should not think about the past first, but look to the future, and the future requires us to establish good and friendly relations between the Soviet and German peoples.
    I want to talk again about the issue of German reunification that everyone has already touched upon. We understand that this is an important issue for the German people. But you should also understand the other side. We once fairly and frankly warned the German side that the Paris Accords and the Federal Republic of Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would cut off the path to resolving this issue in the future. Let's be frank: we cannot agree to solve this problem within the scope you hope for.
    Now some people are discussing the issue of German reunification, saying that a reunited Germany should join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the spearhead of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is directed against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. This has been confirmed by all the events that have happened in the past. The following fact is proof: when we announced in the past that we were willing to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, we were rejected, and the reason we were rejected was because this group was established to deal with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Since the organization was established to target us, what we government officials should strive to do is to weaken this organization, not strengthen it. This is a natural hope. Since the Federal Republic of Germany has joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the German Democratic Republic has not joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, then we would be fools if we promoted the joining of the entire Germany to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, thereby strengthening the forces targeting us. I believe that if the Federal Republic of Germany were in this position, its leaders would do the same as we do, and they would be right to do so.
    So where is the way out of the current situation? It is too late to raise the issue of abolishing the Paris Accords. Now that the agreement has been implemented, no one will agree to do so. Raising the issue of the Federal Republic of Germany withdrawing from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is also unrealistic. If we do this, it would be like we are issuing some kind of ultimatum. We will not raise this issue. Therefore, starting from the actual situation that has already been created today, the Soviet government has put forward its proposal: advocating the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany and creating conditions under which trade between our two countries can develop favorably, and in this regard, we have very great potential.
    The Federal Republic of Germany, with its strong industry, can obtain profitable orders in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is rich in mineral and agricultural raw materials. Therefore, our two countries—the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany—are not competitors. You cannot find such favorable conditions in economic and trade relations with all Western countries as between our two countries. Trade—this is a voluntary matter. If you have goods that you want to sell, and it is beneficial for you to sell them, then you sell them. We do the same. If it is not beneficial for you to develop trade relations with us—then you don't have to do so. We are dispensable. I say this, and you also know this, because the Soviet Union is so vast, it has its own strong industry, mineral raw materials, agricultural raw materials, and it has a glorious working class and collective farmers, excellent cadres, scientists and engineers. However, if we establish trade relations with you, this will promote both the economic development of the Soviet Union and the economic development of the Federal Republic of Germany.
    Regarding the issue of cultural ties. I think there is no need to say much about this issue, because it is obvious that this kind of connection is beneficial to the comprehensive development of our relations.
    This is our attitude. I dare say that if our respected partners are not prepared to negotiate and reach an agreement on the establishment of diplomatic, trade and cultural relations now, if they want to wait, I think it is okay to wait, we are not eager; but I think that the continued existence of a state of no diplomatic relations between our two major countries is probably not wise. The interests of the German people and the interests of the various peoples of the Soviet Union require the normalization of relations between our two countries. Because doing so will promote better mutual understanding and help eradicate distrust. All this will be a prerequisite for the restoration of German unity. We understand your attitude. But we and you both have a stake in the normalization of relations and the easing of tensions. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish contact between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. As for the conditions under which this work is carried out, it is not our business to make suggestions to you. If you have the desire, you will find a way to solve this matter.
    One of the goals of the Soviet government is to ensure world peace. We do not want to find other ways besides establishing friendly relations, and we do not want the spearhead of this relationship to be directed against other countries—Britain, France, the United States, or any other country. We believe that is not our policy. The Soviet Union is willing to establish normal friendly relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, and at the same time, we are willing to establish this kind of relationship between our country and Britain, between our country and France, between our country and the United States, and between our country and other countries in the world.

    在苏联和西德两国政府代表团九月十日会谈中
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫的发言
    我想对联邦总理阿登纳先生和外交部长勃伦塔诺先生的发言表示一些意见。阿登纳先生说，苏联军队在德国领土上推进时似乎也曾经胡作非为。我们坚决否认这一点。苏联把侵略者逐出我国领土后继续追赶他们，是因为他们没有投降。如果我们的军队不去追赶他们，那末敌人就会重整旗鼓再度进犯。因此，苏军不能停在半路上，它应当达到自己的目的——消灭敌人。苏联军人继续进行了德国法西斯分子所强加于他们的战争并且消灭了敌人，他们流出了自己的鲜血，对本国人民完成了神圣的职责。这难道是胡作非为吗？如果有哪国的军队进攻德国，而德军由防御转入进攻，这难道可以叫做胡作非为吗？这是人民的神圣天职。因此我认为，这种说法是对苏联军队的一种侮辱。这就是我所不得不发表的第一点意见。
    联邦共和国总理先生和外交部长先生在发言中说道，许多家属丝毫不知道他们的亲人的消息。我们是理解这些家属——父母妻儿的痛苦心情的。但是，你们应该勇于指出真正的祸首。谁对许多养育者和亲人没有回家负有罪责呢？这是希特勒和他的匪帮带来的灾难。如果说德国人牺牲了很多，那末苏联人民却牺牲得更多。我们应该向谁提出要求呢？意大利（苏联是从来没有进攻意大利的）的某些政治家现在向我们提出要求说，同德国法西斯分子一起进攻我们的许多意大利士兵没有回到家里。他们问道：我们的士兵哪里去了呢？这些士兵已经埋葬在苏联的国土里了。
    战争不是我们发动的，因此我们对许多人没有回家是没有罪责的。千百万人的牺牲应该是一个警告，使得将来不要重演这一悲剧。如果谁要尝试重演希特勒所干的事情，那末这也将得到同样的结局，或者是更悲惨的结局。
    我希望德意志联邦共和国的代表先生们正确地了解我的意思。我们应该在心平气和的情况下开诚布公地、真诚地讨论问题。在谈判中我们不应当心怀激愤，更不应当存心报复。激愤和报复是坏的顾问，它们永远不会导致正确的解决办法。我们应该明白这一点。当然，我们不能完全忘怀过去，但是在解决问题时首先不要惦记过去，而要瞻望未来，而未来则要求我们建立苏联人民和德国人民之间的良好的友好关系。
    我要再谈一下大家已经涉及到的恢复德国统一的问题。我们明白，这对德国人民是一个重要的问题。但是你们也应该了解另一方面。我们曾经公正地和直率地警告德方说，巴黎协定和德意志联邦共和国的参加北大西洋公约组织会切断今后解决这个问题的道路。让我们坦白地说吧：我们不能同意在你们所希望的范围内解决这个问题。
    现在有人这样议论恢复德国的统一的问题，他们说重新统一了的德国应当加入北大西洋公约组织，而北大西洋公约组织的矛头是针对苏联和人民民主国家的。这一点已经是由过去发生的一切事件证实了。下面这一事实就是明证，过去当我们宣布，我们愿意加入北大西洋公约组织时，我们被拒绝了，所以被拒绝是因为这一集团的建立就是为了对付苏联和人民民主国家的。既然所建立的组织的矛头针对着我们，那末我们这些政府人员所应该努力去做的，就是使这个组织削弱，而不是使它加强。这是理所当然的希望。既然德意志联邦共和国加入了北大西洋公约组织，而德意志民主共和国没有加入北大西洋公约组织，那末，如果我们促使整个德国加入北大西洋公约组织，从而使矛头针对我们的力量加强起来，那我们就是傻子了。我相信，德意志联邦共和国如果处在这种地位，它的领导人所作所为也会像我们一样，而他们这样做也是对的。
    那末当前局势的出路究竟在哪里呢？现在提出废除巴黎协定的问题已经晚了，这一协定既已实现了，那末谁也不会同意这样做。提出使德意志联邦共和国退出北大西洋公约组织的问题吧，这也是不现实的，如果这样做，那就等于我方提出了某种最后通牒。我们不会提出这个问题。因此，从今天既已造成的实际情况出发，苏联政府提出了它的建议：主张同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系以及创造我们两国之间的贸易可以获得有利发展的条件，而在这一方面我们是有着十分巨大的潜力的。
    拥有强大工业的德意志联邦共和国可以在苏联获得有利可图的定货。苏联的矿物原料和农业原料都很丰富。因此，我们两国——苏联和德意志联邦共和国——并不是竞争的对手。你们并不是同一切西方国家在经济和贸易关系方面都可以找到像我们两国之间的这种有利条件的。贸易——这是自愿的事情。如果你们有商品要想出售，出售对你们有利，那末你们就出售。我们也这样做。如果同我们发展贸易关系，对你们没有好处——那就不必这么做。我们是可有可无的。不同西德贸易，我们的经济也将胜利地发展。我所以要这样说，你们也知道这一点，是因为苏维埃国家幅员是这样辽阔，它有自己强大的工业、矿物原料、农业原料，它拥有光荣的工人阶级和集体农民、优秀的干部、科学家和工程师。但是，如果我们同你们建立贸易关系，这将既能促进苏维埃国家的经济发展，也能促进德意志联邦共和国的经济发展。
    关于文化联系的问题。我认为，关于这一问题甚至不必说很多的话，因为很明显，这种联系对全面发展我们的关系是有好处的。
    这就是我们的态度。我敢说，如果我们尊敬的伙伴现在不准备就建立外交、贸易和文化关系的问题进行谈判和达成协议，如果他们要等待的话，我认为可以等待，我们不是迫不及待的；不过我认为，我们两大国之间没有外交关系的状态继续存在，未必是理智的。德国人民的利益和苏联各族人民的利益要求我们两国关系正常化。因为这样做将促使更好地互相了解，将有助于根除不信任。这一切将是恢复德国统一的前提。我们是明白你们的态度的。但是我们和你们对于关系的正常化和紧张局势的缓和都有利害的关系。因此，德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国之间建立接触将是有好处的。至于在怎样的条件下进行这件工作，向你们作提示不是我们的事情。如果你们具有愿望，你们将找到解决这件事的途径。
    苏联政府的一个目标是——保障世界和平。我们除了建立友好关系以外，不想寻找其他的途径，而且我们不想让这种关系的矛头针对着其他国家——英国、法国、美国或是任何其他国家。我们认为，那不是我们的政策。苏联愿意同德意志联邦共和国建立正常的友好关系，同时我们也愿意我们的国家同英国之间，我们的国家同法国之间，我们的国家同美国之间，我们的国家同世界上其他各国之间建立这种关系。
