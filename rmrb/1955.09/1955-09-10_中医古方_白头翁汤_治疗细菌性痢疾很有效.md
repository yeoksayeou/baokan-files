Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula "Baitouweng Decoction" Very Effective in Treating Bacterial Dysentery

In August of this year, Shanghai Municipal Contagious Disease Hospital and Shanghai Municipal Fourth People's Hospital treated thirty-two patients with bacterial dysentery using the ancient formula "Baitouweng Decoction" of the famous ancient Chinese doctor Zhang Zhongjing, with a cure rate of 100%.

"Baitouweng Decoction" is recorded in Zhang Zhongjing's "Treatise on Cold Damage," written more than 1,700 years ago. The original formula includes four Chinese herbal medicines: Baitouweng (Pulsatilla chinensis), Huangbai (Phellodendron amurense), Huanglian (Coptis chinensis), and Qinpi (Fraxinus rhynchophylla). The dosages of the drugs currently used by these two hospitals have been researched and modified by Shanghai Municipal Eleventh People's Hospital (Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital). Among the patients they cured with this ancient formula, there were elderly people in their sixties, children as young as two years old, and pregnant women. After taking "Baitouweng Decoction" continuously for three to eight days, the patients' body temperatures and bowel movements returned to normal, other symptoms were reduced or disappeared, and their appetites gradually increased, with no side effects observed. The Shanghai Municipal Fourth People's Hospital, because children were unaccustomed to taking oral decoctions, used "Baitouweng Decoction" for enemas, and the same results were obtained.

On September 6, the two hospitals presented clinical experimental reports at a symposium on the treatment of dysentery with "Baitouweng Decoction" held by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中医古方“白头翁汤”治疗细菌性痢疾很有效
    上海市立传染病院和上海市立第四人民医院在今年八月一个月中，采用中国古代名医张仲景的“白头翁汤”古方治疗了三十二个细菌性痢疾病人，治愈率达百分之百。
    “白头翁汤”记载在一千七百多年前张仲景著的“伤寒论”书中，原方内容包括白头翁、黄柏、黄连和秦皮四种中药。目前这两个医院所用的药物剂量是经过上海市立第十一人民医院（中医院）研究修改过的。他们用这个古方治愈的病人中，有六十多岁的老人、两岁的小孩和孕妇。这些病人在连续服用“白头翁汤”三天到八天后，体温和大便恢复正常，其它症状也都减轻或消失，并且食欲逐渐增强，没有发现任何副作用。上海市立第四人民医院为小孩不习惯口服煎液，曾用“白头翁汤”灌肠治疗，所得效果相同。
    九月六日，这两个医院在上海市卫生局举办的介绍“白头翁汤”治疗痢疾的座谈会上，作了临床实验报告。　（新华社）
