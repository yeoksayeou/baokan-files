    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 4th: According to Vietnam News Agency on September 3rd, the Vietnamese International Supervisory and Control Commission suggested on August 29th that the French Federal Forces side release another thirteen Vietnamese prisoners who were illegally detained in Chi Hoa Prison near Saigon.
    The International Commission pointed out that these prisoners should be released in accordance with Article 21, Clause C of the Geneva Accords, and handed over to the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army.
    In mid-July prior to this, the International Commission had suggested that the French Federal Forces side hand over another fifteen Vietnamese prisoners detained in Chi Hoa Prison to the Vietnamese People's Army side. However, the French Federal Forces side has not accepted this suggestion. It requested the International Commission to authorize the on-the-spot release of these prisoners, instead of handing them over to the Vietnamese People's Army side in accordance with Article 21, Clause C of the Geneva Accords. It attempted to detain these prisoners and wanted to use this method to obstruct the investigation by the International Commission's mobile inspection team.

    越南国际委员会再次要法方释放越方俘虏
    新华社河内四日讯　据越南通讯社三日讯：越南国际监督和监察委员会在八月二十九日建议法兰西联邦部队方面再释放十三名被非法地拘留在西贡附近志和监狱的越方俘虏。
    国际委员会指出，这些俘虏应当根据日内瓦协定第二十一条丙款的规定予以释放，并且把他们交给越南人民军总司令部。
    在这以前的七月中旬，国际委员会曾建议法兰西联邦部队方面把拘留在志和监狱的另外十五名越方俘虏交给越南人民军方面。但是，法兰西联邦部队方面还没有接受这个建议，它要求国际委员会授权就地释放这些俘虏，而不按照日内瓦协定第二十一条丙款把他们交给越南人民军方面。它企图把这些被拘留的俘虏扣留，并且想用这个办法来阻止国际委员会机动视察小组的调查。
