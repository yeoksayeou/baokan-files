	Copper wire mesh is also called copper wire cloth. It is one of the main components of modern papermaking equipment. In the papermaking process, the pulp must pass through the copper wire mesh to become paper. Without copper wire mesh, the flour industry cannot sift the ground wheat properly. The chemical industry also needs copper wire mesh to assist in production.

	Now, China's first modern copper wire mesh factory—the Jiamusi Copper Wire Mesh Factory—has been basically completed and will soon be partially put into trial production. This copper wire mesh factory is a component of the Jiamusi Integrated Paper Mill. When it is officially put into production, it will play a significant supporting role in the development of China's papermaking and other industries.

	There are many types of copper wire mesh, including plain weave, twill weave, three-strand weave, and special mesh. The density of various copper wire meshes also varies. The coarsest copper wire mesh has only five or six warp and weft threads per square inch, while the finest copper wire mesh has one or two hundred warp and weft threads per square inch, which is much denser than the ordinary silk we wear.

	Before liberation, China could not produce copper wire mesh, and the copper wire mesh needed in various industries was imported from abroad. After liberation, the People's Government built a copper wire mesh factory attached to the Shenyang Paper Mill in Shenyang, but its equipment was relatively simple, and most of the operations were manual. Therefore, the copper wire mesh produced was not precise enough, and it was only suitable for low-speed cylinder papermaking machines that produce single-sided glossy paper. The copper wire mesh needed for the Fourdrinier papermaking machines that manufacture the large quantities of newsprint and industrial paper needed domestically still relied on imports. Since 1954, state-owned paper mills across the country have imported copper wire mesh worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. With the development of China's industrial construction and cultural undertakings, the papermaking industry must also develop accordingly. Therefore, the demand for copper wire mesh will gradually increase. It is not cost-effective to import large quantities of copper wire mesh from abroad for a long time, and sometimes even with money, it is impossible to buy copper wire mesh that fully meets the needs. After the Jiamusi Copper Wire Mesh Factory is officially put into production, its output can meet the needs of the whole country. In terms of variety, this factory can produce copper wire mesh for manufacturing cultural paper such as printing books and newspapers, copper wire mesh for manufacturing industrial paper such as cement bags, cable paper, insulating paper, and cigarette paper, as well as copper wire mesh for the flour and chemical industries.

	All the equipment of the Jiamusi Copper Wire Mesh Factory is manufactured in the Soviet Union. From copper alloying to weaving, each production link is equipped with the most precise instruments. Workers use these instruments to operate the machines, carry out production, and inspect product quality, which can not only improve production efficiency but also greatly reduce the labor intensity of workers.

	In the old copper wire mesh factories, copper was melted using coke, and workers produced in high temperatures all day long, making them susceptible to injuries. In the casting workshop of the Jiamusi Copper Wire Mesh Factory, workers only need to put the copper in a high-frequency electric furnace and press a button. The copper can be melted in a dozen minutes.

	In the old copper wire mesh factories, the quality of melted copper relied on visual inspection, which easily led to defective products. In the Jiamusi Copper Wire Mesh Factory, workers can accurately know the degree of copper melting by simply looking at the instrument readings.

	In the old copper wire mesh factories, workers had to watch the mesh surface every minute and every second when weaving the mesh in order to detect broken wires or other abnormal situations in time and stop the machine immediately; otherwise, the woven mesh would easily be scrapped. Because the copper wires are thin and the mesh is very dense, it is very strenuous to look at, and workers' vision is easily damaged. The weaving machines of the Jiamusi Copper Wire Mesh Factory are very precise and are equipped with automatic shutdown devices. During production, the machine will automatically stop whether the warp or weft thread is broken. Therefore, it not only ensures product quality but also protects the health of workers.

	The Jiamusi Copper Wire Mesh Factory also has perfect waste recovery equipment. In the old copper wire mesh factories, the waste of copper was quite large. Because the surface of the copper wire turns black after being woven into a mesh, it needs to be acid-washed to make it shine. During the acid-washing process, a layer of copper on the surface of the copper mesh is washed off, and this copper runs away with the sewage. The Soviet Union was very thoughtful when designing the copper wire mesh factory for our country. A sedimentation tank was set up in the sewage ditch. When the sewage passes through the sedimentation tank, the copper content is completely retained. In this way, a lot of valuable copper can be recovered every year.

	The Soviet government not only helped our country design the Jiamusi Copper Wire Mesh Factory, but also sent experts to help during construction. The experts came here when the factory construction project started in August last year and have been enthusiastically helping our country's workers and technicians solve various difficult problems encountered in the construction of the factory. In April this year, a very complex acid-washing tank project started on the construction site. The bricklayers in charge of this project did not know how to build it, so he patiently drew an operation diagram for the workers and squatted in the acid-washing tank to teach the workers how to build acid-resistant bricks. He also climbed into the concealment area under the tank, which was only half a meter high, to check the quality. After the civil engineering was completed, the experts guiding production came to the copper wire mesh factory. Now they are helping our country train workers and managers who master this modern copper wire mesh factory, actively creating conditions for starting production. (Attached picture)

### 佳木斯铜网厂

    佳木斯铜网厂
    李茜
    铜网也叫铜丝布。它是现代造纸设备的主要部件之一。在造纸过程中，纸浆必须经过铜网才能变成纸型。面粉工业没有铜网，就不能把磨碎的麦子筛好。化学工业也需要铜网来配合生产。
    现在，我国第一座现代化铜网厂——佳木斯铜网厂已基本上建设成功，最近即将部分投入试生产。这个铜网厂是佳木斯综合造纸厂的一个组成部分，正式投入生产后，对我国造纸等工业的发展将起重大的配合作用。
    铜网的种类很多，有平织网、捻织网、三线网和特种网等。各种铜网的密度也不一样，最粗的铜网每平方吋只有经纬线各五、六根，精细的铜网每平方吋有经纬线各一二百根，比我们穿的普通绸子还要密得多。
    解放前，我国不能生产铜网，各种工业中所需要的铜网，都是从国外进口的。解放后，人民政府在沈阳建设一个附属于沈阳造纸厂的铜网厂，但是它的设备比较简单，大部分用手工操作，所以生产的铜网不够精密，只适合于生产单面光纸的低速度圆网造纸机使用，而制造国内大量需要的新闻纸和工业用纸的长网造纸机上所需要的铜网，仍靠国外进口。一九五四年以来，全国国营造纸厂进口的铜网价值数十万元。随着我国工业建设和文化事业的发展，造纸工业也要相应地发展，所以对铜网的需要必将逐渐增加，长期以大量外汇从国外进口铜网是不合算的，而且有的时候有钱也买不到完全满足需要的铜网。佳木斯铜网厂正式投入生产后，它的产量可以满足全国的需要。在品种方面，这个工厂可以生产制造印刷书籍、报纸等文化用纸的铜网，可以生产制造水泥袋、电缆纸、绝缘纸和卷烟纸等工业用纸的铜网，也可以生产面粉工业和化学工业等用的铜网。
    佳木斯铜网厂的全部设备都是苏联制造的。从配铜到织网，每一个生产环节都设有最精密的仪表，工人们通过这些仪表来操纵机器、进行生产和检验产品质量，既可以提高生产效率，又能大大减轻工人的劳动强度。
    在旧的铜网厂里，都是用焦炭化铜，工人们整天在高温中生产，身体很容易受伤；在佳木斯铜网厂的铸造车间里，工人们只要把铜放在高周波电炉内，按一按电钮，十几分钟后就可以把铜溶化好了。
    在旧的铜网厂里，铜是否化好了，是依靠肉眼的鉴定，所以很容易出废品。在佳木斯铜网厂里，工人们只要一看仪表的度数，就可以准确地知道铜的溶化程度。
    在旧的铜网厂里，工人们在织网的时候，眼睛必须每分每秒地看着网面，才能及时地发现断线或其他不正常的情况，立即停车；不然，织出的网很容易报废。由于铜线细、网也很密，看起来很吃力，工人的视力很容易受损害。佳木斯铜网厂的织网机器非常精密，并且附设有自动停车装置，在生产时不管是经线还是纬线断了，机器都会自动停下来。因此，它既保证产品质量，又保障工人身体健康。
    佳木斯铜网厂还有完善的废品回收设备。在旧的铜网厂中，铜的浪费是相当大的。因为铜丝织成网后，表面即变成黑色，需要经过酸洗才能发亮。在酸洗过程中，铜网表面的铜就被洗掉一层，这些铜就随着污水跑掉了。苏联为我国设计铜网厂时想得非常周到，在污水沟内设了一个沉淀池，污水经过沉淀池时，将所含的铜质完全留下。这样，每年便可以收回许多宝贵的铜。
    苏联政府不仅帮助我国设计佳木斯铜网厂，而且在施工的时候，又派专家来帮助。专家从去年八月建厂工程开工的时候来到这里，一直热情地帮助我国的工人和技术人员解决建厂中所遇到的各种困难问题。今年四月，工地上一项很复杂的酸洗槽工程开工了，担任这项工程的瓦工不懂如何修建，他就耐心地为工人们画了一张操作图，并蹲在洗酸槽中教工人砌耐酸砖。他还爬进只有半公尺高的槽下隐蔽部去检查质量。土建工程完工后，指导生产的专家们又来到了铜网厂。现在他们正在帮助我国培养掌握这座现代化铜网厂的工人和管理人员，积极地为开工生产创造条件。（附图片）
