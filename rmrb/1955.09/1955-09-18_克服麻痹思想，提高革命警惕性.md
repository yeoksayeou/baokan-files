    Overcome Complacency, Raise Revolutionary Vigilance

    Attention Must Be Paid to the Safekeeping of Confidential Documents
    Editor:
    One evening at the end of July, the main gate of the Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the doors and windows of eleven offices, including the chairman's office, the director's office, the production department, the organization department, the propaganda department, and the finance department, were wide open. The entire building was empty, and many offices had important documents marked "Confidential," "Top Secret," and "Absolutely Secret" on their desks. At this time, two people entered the building and took some important documents from the basic construction office on the first floor, the production department office on the second floor, and the finance department office on the third floor.
    Strangely enough, no one noticed that they had lost any documents the next day. It wasn't until the production department meeting on the third day that Wang Shijun realized that the document he was keeping was missing. However, he just casually asked a few comrades around him, and when he couldn't find it, he simply ignored it. On the same day, the finance department also discovered that a document was missing. The clerk immediately reported to the director, who calmly said, "It doesn't matter, it won't get lost." The clerk saw that the director was very calm and stopped looking for it. And Li Shijie, of the basic construction office, did not discover that his document was missing for a long time.
    Some people may suspect that these documents may not be very important! No, among the missing documents, some had the total investment amount and future production capacity of each key project; some had the completed figures of the provincial state-owned factories and mines' production plan last year, as well as the production plan figures and completion methods for this year; some had the number of employees, total output value, and production capacity of each factory and mine in the province. Obviously, these are all extremely important classified materials.
    Seven or eight days later, the agency held an enlarged meeting of the Party branch, and everyone learned that these documents had been taken away by the secretary of the Party branch as the Party organization's representative checking the agency's security work.
    These situations happened during the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Shouldn't this arouse vigilance? Xiaozhong

    You Should Cherish Your Credentials
    Editor:
    Newspapers everywhere often publish many advertisements for lost and voided credentials. I did a statistical analysis of such advertisements published in the Shandong "Dazhong Daily" from August 1st to September 3rd and found that there were about 150 pieces of credentials declared lost and void, including badges of the People's Liberation Army, work permits, entry permits, service permits, internship permits, guest permits, and badges of various agencies, and even the official seal of the "First Brigade of the Shandong Yellow River Conservancy Bureau Engineering Corps" was lost.
    China Youth Daily once exposed such an incident: A swindler named Dong Weijun in Tianjin picked up the school badge of Hebei Normal College at the beginning of this year, and then impersonated a "student union representative" to go to more than a dozen schools, including Nankai University, Tianjin University, Tianjin Medical College, Tianjin Nursing School, Tianjin No. 2 Girls' Middle School, No. 3 Girls' Middle School, No. 6 Girls' Middle School, No. 17 Middle School, and No. 18 Middle School, to ask the student union leaders to report to him and give "instructions." Of course, this swindler was finally arrested; but at the time, who knew whether the credentials this swindler was carrying had already been declared lost and void in the newspaper? This incident shows that bad elements who pick up other people's lost credentials will use them to swindle and deceive, disrupt social order, and even carry out various serious counter-revolutionary activities.
    However, many of our comrades think that if their credentials are lost, they can simply spend a few yuan to put an advertisement in the newspaper and then get another one; anyway, after the advertisement is published to declare it void, they will no longer be responsible. These comrades have not thought about what terrible losses the loss of credentials could cause to the country! All state organs, enterprises, and organizations should use this anti-counter-revolutionary campaign to educate their staff to protect their credentials as they would protect their own eyes. Yi Zhen

    Confidential Documents Are Not Allowed to Be Sent by Ordinary Mail
    Editor:
    At present, some units neglect the work of safeguarding state secrets in order to save postage. For example, the Liaoning Provincial Company of the China Minerals Company sent us a notification of changes in coal exports by ordinary mail; the Jixi Mining Bureau sent the August transportation plan as printed matter; and the Anshan Iron and Steel Raw Materials Department also sent us a table of Anshan Iron and Steel's coking coal inventory, receipts, and daily usage by ordinary mail.
    I believe that the contents of these documents are related to national economic secrets and should be sent as confidential documents, or at least by registered mail. Sending them by ordinary mail is very dangerous. If they are lost and fall into the hands of counter-revolutionary elements, our economic construction will suffer losses. Currently, a struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements is being carried out across the country. Why are these units so careless in safeguarding state secrets? I hope these units will examine their complacency.

    Personnel Going to Factories and Mines for Internships Must Pay Attention to Confidentiality
    Editor:
    In order to ensure that students who come to our factory for production internships can do a good job in confidentiality, we have, according to instructions from higher authorities, explained to them the scope of confidentiality and the disciplines that should be observed, and strictly implemented the system of notebook registration, stamping, and review. However, some students from certain universities and colleges who come to our factory for production internships still do not take the confidentiality work seriously. For example, Zhou Dagang and 35 others from Northeast Institute of Technology privately copied 20 copies of top-secret materials; Lu Shengyi and 36 others from Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology privately printed certain record forms and copied more than 130 copies of confidential numerical data. The notebooks used by teachers and students of Renmin University of China for their internships were all purchased privately and did not have the school's official seal or registration number. Even more serious, Li Minghe, a graduate student from Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, privately took confidential materials back to his dormitory to copy them, which resulted in a loss incident.
    As far as I know, these kinds of phenomena also exist in other factories and mines. Therefore, it is necessary to once again remind personnel from various universities and colleges who go to factories and mining enterprises for production internships to abide by the confidentiality system; at the same time, it is recommended that each school conduct strict confidentiality education for personnel sent to participate in internships and assist enterprises in doing a good job in confidentiality.

### 克服麻痹思想，提高革命警惕性

    克服麻痹思想，提高革命警惕性
    必须注意保管机要文件编辑同志：
    七月末的一个晚上，吉林省工会联合会的机关大门和主席办公室、主任办公室、生产部、组织部、宣传部、财务处等十一个办公室的门窗都大开着。全楼一个人也没有，而不少办公室的桌子上都放着写有“机密”、“极密”、“绝密”字样的重要文件。正当这个时候，有两个人走进了大楼，在一楼基本建设办公室、二楼生产部办公室和三楼财务处办公室拿走了一些重要文件。
    很令人奇怪，到了第二天，竟没有任何人发觉自己丢了文件。第三天生产部开会的时候，王世俊才发觉自己保管的那份文件不见了。但是他只是不慌不忙地问了周围几个同志，找不到也就不管了。同一天，财务处也发现丢了文件，干事马上报告处长，处长毫不着急地说：“不要紧，丢不了。”干事看处长很沉着，也就不找了。而基本建设办公室李世杰同志丢的那份文件在很长时间里还没有一个人发觉。
    有人也许会怀疑，这些文件可能是不很重要吧！不，丢失的几份文件里，有的文件上有各重点工程投资总额和将来的生产能力；有的文件上有去年全省国营厂矿生产计划完成数字，今年各类生产计划数字和完成办法；有的文件上有全省各厂矿职工人数、生产总值和生产能力。显然，这些都是极其重要的机密材料。
    事情过了七、八天，机关里召开了党支部扩大会议，大家才知道这些文件是机关党支部书记代表党组织检查机关保密工作时拿走的。
    这些情况发生在肃反斗争中，难道还不应该引起警惕吗？　晓钟
    应该爱护自己的证件编辑同志：
    各地报纸上经常刊载着很多证件遗失作废的广告。我把八月一日到九月三日的山东“大众日报”登的这类广告统计了一下，就发现声明遗失作废的证件共有一百五十件左右，其中有解放军的胸章，各机关的工作证、出入证、服务证、实习证、来宾证和证章，甚至“山东黄河河务局工程总队第一大队”连公章也丢失了。
    中国青年报曾经揭发过这样一个事件：天津市有个叫董维钧的骗子，在今年年初从路上拾得了河北师范学院的校徽，于是冒充“学联代表”到南开大学、天津大学、天津医学院、天津护士学校、天津市女二中、女三中、女六中、十七中、十八中等十几个学校去，要学生会负责人向他汇报工作，并作了“指示”。当然，这个骗子最后是被捕了；但当时谁又知道这个骗子带的证章是不是已经在报纸上声明遗失作废的呢？这个事件说明，坏分子拣到了别人丢失的证件，就会利用它来招摇撞骗，扰乱社会治安，甚至进行各种严重的反革命活动。
    但是，我们的很多同志却以为证件遗失了，顶多花上几块钱登登报，就再领一个；反正登报作废后自己就可以不负责了。这些同志没有想一想，丢失证件以致可能给国家造成何等可怕的损失！各个国家机关、企业、团体应该通过这次肃反运动，教育工作人员像保卫自己的眼珠那样来保存自己的证件。　易珍
    机密文件不许用平信寄递编辑同志：
    目前有些单位为了节省邮资，而忽视了保守国家机密的工作。例如，中国矿产公司辽宁省公司将有关对外出口煤炭变更的情况用平信寄给我们单位；鸡西矿务局将八月份运输计划当印刷品寄；鞍钢原燃料处将鞍钢炼焦煤炭库存、收到及当日使用的数量情况表也用平信寄给我们单位。
    我认为，这些文件内容是有关国家经济机密的，应该作为密件寄送，起码也应用挂号信寄。用平信寄是很危险的，万一丢失了，落到反革命分子的手里，就会使我们的经济建设事业遭到损失。目前全国各地正在开展肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子的斗争，这些单位为什么这样不注意保守国家机密呢？希望这些单位检查一下自己的麻痹思想。

    到厂矿实习的人员要重视保密工作编辑同志：
    为了使来我厂进行生产实习的学生能够做好保密工作，我们曾根据上级指示，对他们讲明了保密范围和应该遵守的纪律，并且严格地执行了笔记本登记、盖章和审查的制度。但是，有某些高等学校来厂生产实习的学生仍然没有认真重视保密工作。例如，东北工学院周大刚等三十六人私自抄录了绝密资料二十份；北京钢铁工业学院卢盛意等三十七人私自印刷某些记录表格，并抄录了有关机密的数字资料一百三十多份。中国人民大学师生实习用的笔记本全是私人买的，没有校方的图章及编号登记。更严重的是北京钢铁工业学院研究生李明和将机密材料私自带回宿舍抄录，结果就造成了丢失事件。
    据我了解，这类现象在其它厂矿也有。因此，有必要再次提醒各高等学校到厂矿企业进行生产实习的人员必须遵守保密制度；同时建议各学校对派出参加实习的人员严格地进行保密教育，协助企业做好保密工作。
