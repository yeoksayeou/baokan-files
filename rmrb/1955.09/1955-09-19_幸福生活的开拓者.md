    Pioneers of a Happy Life
    Jin Tong
    Xinjiang is our country's rich frontier. The Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has reclaimed over 1.1 million mu of wasteland here in the past six years, established farms in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, built reservoirs and canals, and planted grain and cotton. And on this land, they have sown the seeds of socialism.
    Marching into the Grassland
    In 1950, this production corps carried out Chairman Mao's wise instructions and began a large-scale production battle. Although the production conditions were very difficult at that time and production tools were very scarce, the difficulties did not defeat our soldiers because they understood that "happiness must be earned through hard work." They contributed all their strength to a happy tomorrow.
    In order to expand the planting area, the soldiers organized "Youth Shock Brigades" and "Resist-America, Aid-Korea Reclamation Teams," clearing away the numerous obstacles in their path. In that year alone, the reclamation soldiers in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains used pickaxes, "two oxen pulling a plow," and a small number of plows to reclaim 835,000 mu of virgin land, and for the first time sowed wheat, cotton, corn, rice, and other crops on grasslands that had never grown crops before, harvesting 53.9 million jin of grain, laying the foundation for future expansion of production.
    Our soldiers are all from working-class backgrounds. It's natural to say they're not "outsiders" when it comes to growing crops, but to produce with advanced science and technology, they had to start from scratch. In order to increase crop yields, starting in 1952, the soldiers resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from the Soviet Union," and launched a wave of learning Soviet agricultural science and technology in the corps, which rapidly improved the level of agricultural production technology. Over the past few years, over 90 percent of the production personnel in the corps have mastered certain production techniques and management skills through production training. Liu Xuefo, who once created the highest cotton record in the country, is a vivid example. Liu Xuefo was an ordinary soldier who initially didn't even know how to thin and fix cotton seedlings, but later he actively learned from the Soviet Union's cotton planting experience and led a high-yield cotton team, finally creating a yield of 733 jin per mu on 53 mu of high-yield cotton land, with three mu reaching a high yield of 1,184 jin per mu.
    Bumper Harvests of Grain and Cotton
    With the continuous improvement of farming techniques and the increasing development of mechanized production, the unit area yield of various crops in the production corps has increased year by year. In 1950, the average yield of wheat was only 80-90 jin per mu, and cotton was only 20-30 jin per mu. By 1952, the yield of winter wheat in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains had exceeded that of 1950 by one to two times, and there was a high-yield record of 1,377 jin per mu of winter wheat. Take the "High-Yield Model Company" of a certain unit in the Manas River Reclamation Area as an example. The grain produced by this company in 1953 alone could feed the entire company for a full sixteen years.
    The Manas River Basin is a base for cotton production. The natural conditions in this area are suitable for cotton growth, and there is snow water from the Tianshan Mountains, which can provide sufficient irrigation for cotton during its growth period. In the past, it was said that cotton could not be grown here, but since the agricultural production corps of the People's Liberation Army came here, they not only planted cotton, but also, under the guidance of Soviet agronomist Titov, implemented close planting and early thinning, early fixing, ridge-furrow irrigation, as well as a series of advanced farming methods such as cultivating, weeding, pruning, and topping, and applied a large amount of granular fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer to the cotton fields, overcoming various natural disasters, and creating a harvest of 402 jin per mu on 20,000 mu of cotton fields. This year, more than 320,000 mu of winter wheat have been harvested, and 150,000 mu of cotton also have hopes for a bumper harvest. These facts of bumper harvests illustrate the brilliant achievements of the soldiers in conquering nature with creative labor.
    A Model for Farmers of All Nationalities
    In the past six years, through the hard work of the soldiers, this corps has successively established dozens of farms on the grasslands in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, with a planting area of over 1.1 million mu, and a total harvest equivalent to nearly 880 million jin of wheat. Mechanized cultivation area accounts for 45 percent of the total cultivated area. In terms of production equipment, it currently has over 850 tractors (converted into standard units), 80 combine harvesters, and over 18,000 head of cattle and horses. The construction of the farms is rapidly moving towards standardization. The Xinjiang grassland has fundamentally changed its face.
    This modern agricultural production corps, which has gradually mastered agricultural science and technology and possesses strong mechanical equipment, has set the best example for farmers of all nationalities in Xinjiang to take the socialist road. Under the influence and help of the corps' collectivized advanced agricultural farming techniques, the production techniques of farmers of all nationalities near the corps'驻地 have been improved, and the yields of various crops have also been continuously increased. Many farmers, seeing the superiority of the corps' collectivized and mechanized production, have joined agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. The production and construction work carried out by the soldiers in the frontier to transform the natural landscape has also attracted and encouraged countless young men and women to actively participate in the country's economic construction work. In the past six years, thousands of young men and women from all over the country have come to Xinjiang to participate in production. The vast majority of these young people have mastered new agricultural science and technology and have become important talents for building standardized state-owned farms.
    This agricultural production corps is also a large-scale agricultural science school. It has not only trained thousands of cadres with certain agricultural technology and management skills, but also constantly dispatches a large number of cadres to help local agricultural production cooperatives carry out production work. From last year to this year alone, more than 6,000 farmer representatives, local technical cadres, workers, and students have visited, interned, and visited the Manas River Reclamation Area. All those who come to visit and inspect are very appreciative of the modern farms established by the soldiers on the grassland.
    Brilliant Prospects
    In the past six years, this production corps, standing at the forefront of agricultural production and construction in Xinjiang, has established a new and happy life on the grassland and created great wealth for the motherland. However, they are not satisfied. In order to accelerate the realization of standardized state-owned farms, produce more and better agricultural products, and support socialist industrialization, according to the First Five-Year Plan, by 1957, the cultivated land area operated by the Production and Construction Corps will be developed to more than 3.1 million mu, the cotton planting area will be expanded by more than eight times (including 50,000 mu of long-staple cotton), and the mechanized cultivation area will be developed to 65 percent of the total cultivated area. By 1957, more modern socialist state-owned farms will appear on the vast grassland. Now, the soldiers are working heroically to realize this huge plan.

    幸福生活的开拓者
    金同
    新疆，是我们祖国富饶的边疆。人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队，六年来在这里开垦了一百几十万亩荒地，在天山南北建立了农场，兴修了水库渠道，种植了粮食和棉花。并且在这块土地上撒下了社会主义的种子。
    向草原进军
    一九五○年，这一支生产部队执行毛主席的英明指示，开始了大规模的生产战斗。虽然那时生产情况很艰苦，生产工具非常缺乏，但是，困难没有难倒我们的战士，因为他们懂得“幸福是要靠艰苦的劳动换来的”。他们把自己的全部力量，贡献给了幸福的明天。
    为了扩大播种面积，战士们组织了“青年突击队”“抗美援朝开垦队”，扫清了横在前进道路上的重重障碍。就在这一年，天山南北的屯垦战士，用坎土镘、“二牛抬杠”和为数不多的犁，开垦了八十三万五千亩处女地，在从未生长过庄稼的草原上，第一次播种了小麦、棉花、包谷、水稻和其他作物，收获了五千三百九十万斤的粮食，为以后扩大生产打下了基础。
    我们的战士都是劳动人民出身，要说种庄稼自然不算是“外行”，但是要用先进的科学技术生产，就得从头学起了。为了提高作物的产量，从一九五二年起，战士们坚决执行了毛主席“学习苏联”的伟大号召，在部队中掀起了学习苏联农业科学技术的热潮，使农业生产技术水平有了迅速的提高。几年来，部队中百分之九十以上的生产人员，通过生产的锻炼，都掌握了一定的生产技术和经营管理的本领。曾经创造了全国棉花最高纪录的刘学佛，就是一个生动的例子。刘学佛是一个普通战士，最初连棉花间苗定苗也不懂，但是后来他积极学习了苏联的植棉经验，领导一个棉花丰产小组，终于在五十三亩棉花丰产地上，创造了每亩七百三十三斤的产量，其中有三亩达到了每亩一千一百八十四斤的高额产量。
    粮棉大丰收
    随着耕作技术的不断提高和机械化生产的日益发展，生产部队各种作物的单位面积产量一年一年提高了。一九五○年一般小麦产量每亩平均不过八、九十斤，棉花每亩平均二、三十斤，到一九五二年，天山南北冬小麦产量超过了一九五○年的一倍到两倍，并出现了冬小麦每亩一千三百七十七斤的丰产纪录。拿玛纳斯河垦区某部“丰产模范连”来说，这个连队一九五三年一年生产的粮食，可供全连人吃整整十六年。
    玛纳斯河流域是生产棉花的基地，这个地区的自然条件适合棉花生长，并有天山雪水，可使棉花在生长期间得到充足的灌溉。过去都说这里不能种植棉花，但从人民解放军农业生产部队到这里以后，不但种植了棉花，而且在苏联农学家提托夫的指导下，实行了密植和早间苗、早定苗，培垅沟灌以及中耕、除草、整枝、打尖等一系列的先进耕作方法，并给棉田大量施用了颗粒肥和磷肥，战胜了各种自然灾害，在两万亩大面积的棉田上，创造了每亩四百零二斤的收成。今年三十二万多亩冬麦已获得丰收，十五万亩棉花也有丰收希望。这些丰收的事实说明了战士们用创造性的劳动征服自然的光辉成就。
    各族农民的榜样
    六年来，经过战士们的艰苦奋斗，这支部队已经在天山南北的草原上先后建立起来了几十个农场，播种面积达到一百一十多万亩，总收获量折合小麦近八亿八千万斤，机耕面积占总耕地面积百分之四十五，在生产装备方面，目前已经拥有拖拉机（折合标准台）八百五十多台，联合收割机八十台，耕牛耕马一万八千多头。农场的建设在迅速向正规化的方向迈进。新疆草原已从根本上改变了自己的面貌。
    这一支逐渐掌握了农业科学技术，并拥有雄厚机械装备的现代化的农业生产部队，给新疆各族农民走社会主义道路作出了最好的榜样。部队驻地附近的各族农民，在部队集体化先进农业耕作技术的影响和帮助下，生产技术有了提高，各种作物产量也在不断提高，不少农民看到部队集体化、机械化生产的优越性，都纷纷参加了农业生产合作社和互助组。战士们在边疆进行的改造自然面貌的生产建设工作，也吸引和鼓舞着无数青年男女积极参加祖国经济建设工作。六年来，从祖国各地先后已有几千名青年男女来到新疆，参加了生产，这些青年绝大多数已经掌握了新的农业科学技术，成为建设正规化国营农场的重要人材。
    这支农业生产部队，也是一所规模巨大的农业科学学校。它不仅自己培养了数千名具有一定农业技术和管理技术的各种干部，每年还不断抽调大批干部帮助地方农业生产合作社进行生产工作。从去年到今年，光是到玛纳斯河垦区进行参观、实习和访问的农民代表，地方技术干部和工人、学生，先后就有六千人以上。凡来参观访问的人，对于战士们在草原上建立起来的现代化农场都非常赞许。
    灿烂的远景
    六年来，这支站在新疆农业生产建设前哨的生产部队，在草原上建立起了新的幸福生活，给祖国创造了巨大的财富。但是，他们并不满足。为了加速实现正规化的国营农场，生产更多更好的农产品，支援社会主义工业化，根据第一个五年计划，到一九五七年，生产建设部队所经营的耕地面积将发展到三百一十多万亩，棉花种植面积要扩大到八倍以上（其中长绒棉有五万亩），机耕面积将发展到总耕地面积的百分之六十五。到了一九五七年，在广阔的草原上，将要出现更多的现代化的社会主义国营农场。现在，战士们正为实现这个巨大的计划而英勇的劳动。
