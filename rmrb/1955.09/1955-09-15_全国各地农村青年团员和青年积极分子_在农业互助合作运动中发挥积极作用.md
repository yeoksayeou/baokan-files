Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: The broad masses of rural Youth League members and young activists are warmly welcoming the upcoming high tide of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Currently, over 7.5 million rural Youth League members have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, accounting for 90 percent of the total number of rural Youth League members, of which over 2.4 million Youth League members have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and many Youth League members have taken on leadership positions.

Under the education of the Party, the government, and the Youth League organizations, the broad masses of rural Youth League members and young activists have become an active force in the agricultural collectivization movement. Youth in agricultural cooperatives in fifteen provinces, including Liaoning, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi, are determined to strive to be excellent members through practical actions. In Xingyang County, Henan Province, youth and League members in 179 agricultural cooperatives have put forward over 4,000 suggestions since last autumn. Fu Renxing, a rich peasant from Shanshan Township, Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, sneaked into an agricultural cooperative and deliberately raised the proportion of land dividends in order to achieve his sinister goal of undermining unity within the cooperative and ruining it. Fu Atang, the deputy director of the agricultural production cooperative and a Youth League member, promptly exposed his conspiracy. Under the leadership and assistance of the Party branch and the cadres stationed in the cooperative, the rich peasant was expelled from the cooperative, consolidating unity within the cooperative.

Rural youth and Youth League members in various localities are enthusiastically learning and promoting agricultural production technology and advanced experience in increasing production. They actively participate in technical training and instruction and have also signed contracts with agricultural technology promotion stations to guarantee teaching and learning. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, and Sichuan, more than 3,000 such contracts have been signed. In Hebei Province, more than 40,000 Youth League members and young people serve as technicians in agricultural cooperatives.

    全国各地农村青年团员和青年积极分子
    在农业互助合作运动中发挥积极作用
    据新华社十四日讯　广大农村青年团员和青年积极分子热烈地迎接就要到来的农村互助合作运动的高潮。目前已有七百五十多万农村青年团员参加了互助合作组织，占农村青年团员总数的百分之九十，其中有二百四十多万青年团员参加了农业生产合作社，不少青年团员担任了领导职务。
    广大农村青年团员和青年积极分子在党和政府及团组织的教育下，已成为农业合作化运动中一支积极的力量。辽宁、浙江、陕西等十五省的农业社内的青年决心以实际行动争取做一个优秀社员。河南荥阳县一百七十九个农业社内的青年和团员，从去年秋季到现在提出各种建议达四千多条。浙江省萧山县山前乡十四村富农富仁兴钻到农业社内，故意将土地分红比例提高，以达到他的破坏社内团结，搞垮农业社的罪恶目的。农业生产合作社副社长、青年团员富阿堂及时揭穿了他的阴谋，在党支部和驻社干部的领导帮助下，将富农清洗出社，使社内的团结得到巩固。
    各地农村青年和青年团员热烈学习和推广农业生产技术、先进增产经验。他们积极参加了技术训练和传授，还同农业技术推广站订立了包教保学合同。据河北、辽宁、吉林、四川等四个省的不完全统计，订立合同的就有三千多个。河北省有四万多名青年团员和青年在农业合作社中担任了技术员。
