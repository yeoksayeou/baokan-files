Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 23rd: Saigon news: Ngô Đình Diệm issued a communiqué on the 21st, reiterating that his government "can never" negotiate with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of Vietnamese general elections as stipulated in the Geneva Accords.

Ngô Đình Diệm said in his statement that opinions could be "exchanged through radio broadcasts." However, "there can be no talk of holding meetings, let alone negotiations."

According to the Geneva Accords, the responsible authorities of both North and South Vietnam should begin consultations on next year's general elections from July 20th this year. Due to the repeated rejections by the Ngô Đình Diệm government, these consultations have not been able to take place to date.

    吴庭艳再次表示拒绝协商
    新华社河内二十三日电　西贡消息：吴庭艳二十一日发表公报，重申他的政府“决不可能”像日内瓦协议所规定的那样同越南民主共和国协商越南普选问题。
    吴庭艳在他的声明中说，可以“通过广播声明来交换意见”。但是，“决谈不上举行会议，更不用说进行谈判了”。
    根据日内瓦协议，越南南北双方负责当局应从今年七月二十日开始就明年的普选问题进行协商。由于吴庭艳政府的一再拒绝，这项协商迄今没有能够举行。
