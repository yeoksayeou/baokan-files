Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 12th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, on behalf of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a memorandum to Ambassador Desai, Chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam, on September 9th. In the memorandum, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army strongly condemned the acts of American imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities in sabotaging the Geneva Accords, and suggested that the International Commission take necessary measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected.

The memorandum is divided into three parts. The first part states that after three hundred days, that is, after the ceasefire was implemented and the regrouping and transfer of troops were completed, the implementation of the Geneva Accords entered a very important new stage, namely the stage of resolving political issues.

The memorandum reviewed the statement issued by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 6th regarding the holding of consultative conferences and the note sent to the Southern government on July 19th. The memorandum pointed out that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam advocates continuing to thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords in order to consolidate peace and achieve the unification of Vietnam.

The memorandum said that, on the contrary, the Southern authorities stubbornly refused consultation, violating Article 7 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. They also openly opposed the Geneva Accords, stubbornly stating that they were not bound by the various provisions of the agreement.

The memorandum said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that due to the conspiracy of American imperialism, the Southern authorities' open actions of sabotaging the agreement, and the ambiguous attitude of the French authorities, the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords is facing a very serious threat.

The memorandum said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the political issues of Vietnam must be resolved correctly in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, that is, by holding consultative conferences between the responsible authorities of both sides to discuss the issue of general elections aimed at unifying Vietnam. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also pointed out that the French government and the South Vietnamese government should bear their respective responsibilities in the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords regarding the cessation of hostilities and the resolution of political issues.

The second part of the memorandum pointed out that American imperialism and the Southern authorities, disregarding the provisions of the Geneva Accords, are stepping up the build-up of armaments and intensifying the suppression and slaughter of the people.

The memorandum said that the number of American military personnel in South Vietnam continues to increase. The American organization and training delegation headed by O'Daniel has been strengthened, including departments such as staff, planning, logistics, operations, intelligence, and security. This delegation effectively controls the command of the South Vietnamese armed forces. American military personnel have been assigned to Ngo Dinh Diem's army, to various military regional headquarters, and to various training centers. In Da Lat training school alone, there are more than 80 American military personnel. At the same time, the General Headquarters of the French Union Forces and the Southern authorities are trying every means to obstruct and shrink the supervision of the International Commission, especially the supervision of ships traveling on the Mekong River. They are attempting to use the US-Cambodia military agreement to increase the transportation of weapons and war materials to South Vietnam through Cambodian territory.

Ngo Dinh Diem's military forces are being continuously strengthened. Recently, the United States planned to expand the armed forces in South Vietnam to ten divisions in 1956. The Ngo Dinh Diem government is stepping up the creation of a war mentality among the Southern army and people, advocating preparations for a "northward advance."

The memorandum pointed out that provocative actions on the 17th parallel are increasing. Ngo Dinh Diem's troops openly rushed into the demilitarized zone to suppress and kill the people. General O'Daniel has inspected the units stationed near the 17th parallel.

The memorandum said that the above facts prove that American imperialism and the Southern authorities have violated the relevant provisions of the ceasefire agreement and the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, and that their above-mentioned actions have received the sympathy of the French government.

The memorandum pointed out that, following the orders of the United States, the Southern authorities are currently suppressing and massacring people who participated in the war of resistance and those who love peaceful reunification and support the Geneva Accords. These actions are in complete violation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

The memorandum said in the third part that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the above situation is extremely serious, because this situation not only violates the relevant provisions stipulated in the ceasefire agreement and the Final Declaration, but also the foundation of the current Geneva Accords is facing a serious threat. Regarding the consultation between the authorities of North and South Vietnam to discuss the issue of free general elections for the unification of Vietnam, it is currently encountering enormous difficulties; the most fundamental desire of the Vietnamese people, namely, to consolidate peace and achieve the unification of the motherland, is being seriously violated. Because the political issues have not been resolved, and because American imperialism and the Southern authorities are conspiring to strengthen their military forces and prepare for war, the current situation in Vietnam is tense, and the consolidation of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia is facing enormous difficulties.

The memorandum pointed out that the main responsibility for undermining the Geneva Accords and making the situation more tense clearly lies with American imperialism and the Southern authorities. The French government and the French Union Forces in Indochina, as a party to the signing of the Geneva Accords, should also bear their own responsibility.

The memorandum said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again declares its policy of continuing to correctly and thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords, and resolutely opposes all actions that violate the agreement and conspiracies to undermine the agreement, and demands that all responsible parties must stop actions that violate and undermine the agreement and thoroughly implement the provisions of political and other issues. The will of the Vietnamese people for peace, unity, independence, and democracy cannot be shaken by any force.

    武元甲向德赛提出关于越南局势的备忘录
    强烈谴责美国和南越当局破坏日内瓦协定的行为
    新华社河内十二日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲将军奉越南民主共和国政府的命令，在九月九日致越南国际监督和监察委员会主席德赛大使一份备忘录。在备忘录中，越南人民军总司令部强烈地谴责美帝国主义和越南南方当局破坏日内瓦协定的行为，同时建议国际委员会采取必要的措施，以使日内瓦协定得到尊重。
    备忘录共分三部分。它的第一部分说，经过三百天后，即在实现停火、完成集结和转移军队之后，执行日内瓦协定进入了一个非常重要的新的阶段，即解决政治问题的阶段。
    备忘录回顾了越南民主共和国为举行协商会议在六月六日发表的声明和在七月十九日致南方政府的照会。备忘录指出，越南民主共和国政府主张继续彻底执行日内瓦协定，以巩固和平，实现越南的统一。
    备忘录说，相反地，南方当局一意拒绝协商，违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言的第七条。它们还公开反对日内瓦协定，顽固地说它们不受协定的各项条款的约束。
    备忘录说，越南民主共和国政府认为：由于美帝国主义的阴谋，由于南方当局的公开破坏协定的行动，由于法国当局的模糊的态度，继续执行日内瓦协定正在遭到非常严重的威胁。
    备忘录说，越南民主共和国政府认为，越南的政治问题一定要正确地按照日内瓦协定的规定来解决，也就是说举行双方负责当局的协商会议，讨论目的在统一越南的普选问题。越南民主共和国政府同时指出，法国政府和越南南方政府应该担当起在继续执行日内瓦协定有关停止敌对行动和解决政治问题中自己所负的责任。
    备忘录的第二部分指出，美帝国主义和南方当局不顾日内瓦协定的规定正在加紧增强军备、加紧镇压和屠杀人民。
    备忘录说，美国在越南南方的军事人员继续不断地增加。以奥丹尼尔为首的美国组织和训练代表团已经得到加强，其中包括参谋、计划、后勤、作战、情报、治安等部门。这个代表团实际上掌握了南越武装力量的指挥权。美国的军事人员已经被分配到吴庭艳的军队中去，到各个军区司令部、各个训练中心去，仅大叻一个训练学校就有美国军事人员八十多人。就在这个时候，法兰西联邦部队总司令部和南方当局想尽各种办法来阻挠和收缩国际委员会的监察，特别阻挠对于来往在湄公河上的船只的监察。他们企图利用美柬军事协定经过柬埔寨境内来增加运送武器和战争物资到南越。
    吴庭艳的军事力量正在得到不断的增强。最近美国计划在一九五六年内把越南南方的武装力量扩充到十个师。吴庭艳政府加紧在南方军队和人民中制造战争心理，鼓吹准备“北进”。
    备忘录指出，十七度线上的挑衅行动愈来愈增多了。吴庭艳的部队公然冲入非军事区镇压和杀害人民。奥丹尼尔将军曾经去视察驻扎在十七度线附近的各部队单位。
    备忘录说，上述事实证明，美帝国主义和南方当局已经违反了停战协定和日内瓦会议最后宣言中规定的有关条款，而它们的上述行动都得到法国政府的同情。
    备忘录指出，遵循美国的命令，目前南方当局正在镇压、残杀曾参加过抗战的人和热爱和平统一、赞成日内瓦协定的人，这些行动完全违反日内瓦协定中规定的条款。
    备忘录在第三部分说，越南民主共和国政府认为，上述情况是极其严重的，因为这种情况不仅违反了停战协定和最后宣言中所规定的有关条款，而且目前日内瓦协定的基础也正遭到严重的威胁。关于越南北方和南方双方当局应当进行协商以讨论关于统一越南的自由普选的问题，目前正碰到巨大的困难；目前越南人民最根本的愿望，即巩固和平、实现祖国统一的愿望，正遭到严重的违反。由于政治问题未得到解决，又由于美帝国主义和南方当局阴谋加强军事力量、准备战争，因此，目前越南的形势紧张起来，越南和东南亚和平的巩固正遭到巨大的困难。
    备忘录指出，关于破坏日内瓦协定使形势更加紧张的主要责任，很明显地是在美帝国主义和南方当局方面，法国政府和在印度支那的法兰西联邦部队是签订日内瓦协定的一方，也应负起自己的责任。
    备忘录说，越南民主共和国政府再一次地说明自己的政策是继续正确而彻底地履行日内瓦协定，并且坚决反对一切违反协定的行为和破坏协定的阴谋，要求有责任的各方必须停止违反和破坏协定的行动并彻底履行政治和其他问题的条款。越南人民的和平、统一、独立和民主的意志是任何力量所不能动摇的。
