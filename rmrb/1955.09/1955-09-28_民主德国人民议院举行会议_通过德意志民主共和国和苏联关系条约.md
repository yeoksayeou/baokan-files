Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 27th. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic opened its session in Berlin on the 26th. The agenda of the meeting included the following items: the treaty on relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; the first and second readings of the constitutional amendment bill; the first and second readings of the law on the national emblem and flag of the German Democratic Republic, etc.

The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, delivered a government statement on the treaty on relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union at the meeting.

Grotewohl first pointed out that the treaty on relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union proves how the relations between the two countries have developed on the basis of selfless friendship. It arises from the spirit of the Geneva Conference and serves the relaxation and understanding that the Geneva Conference is directed towards. The entire German people must seize this opportunity to strive for the welfare of the nation and for the unification of the country on a basis of peace and democracy.

Grotewohl said that the conclusion of the treaty on relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union will greatly promote the recognition of the German Democratic Republic by other countries.

Grotewohl welcomed the Soviet Union's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. He said: After the two German states held negotiations with the Soviet Union in Moscow, the issue has become clearer for everyone who desires unification. There is no other way than to negotiate with the German Democratic Republic. The reunification of Germany is a matter for the Germans themselves. "Policy of strength" has ended in Geneva and been buried in Moscow. The only viable path left is for the two German governments to seek unification through understanding and negotiation. We have been preparing for such negotiations.

Grotewohl then elaborated on the content of the treaty and pointed out that this treaty is a historic document. This treaty and the Moscow negotiations make all of us increasingly convinced that the achievements of the German Democratic Republic and the socialist foundations of our country have been guaranteed and will never be abandoned. Grotewohl finally said that this treaty helps the unification of our motherland because it inspires the progressive forces in West Germany who are engaged in the struggle for unification. Therefore, we call on the entire German people to jointly strengthen their efforts to achieve this great cause and rebuild Germany into a unified, independent, democratic and peace-loving country.

Discussion then began. Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht of the German Socialist Unity Party parliamentary group, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group, and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bolz of the German National Democratic Party parliamentary group spoke in succession. General Secretary Gierlach of the German Free Democratic Party, General Secretary Rose of the Democratic Farmers' Party, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany Correns, and representatives of other mass organizations also spoke successively. All those who spoke agreed with the government statement made by Grotewohl. Representatives of various parliamentary groups of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic expressed their gratitude to the Soviet Union for its friendly attitude towards the German Democratic Republic.

The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic unanimously adopted the treaty on relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. All those present in the hall welcomed this decision of the People's Chamber with stormy and lasting applause.

The People's Chamber then turned to discussing other issues, listened to a speech by Deputy Prime Minister Stoph of the German Democratic Republic, and passed the constitutional amendment bill. This bill made the following addition to Article 5 of the Constitution: "Service in defense of the motherland and the achievements of the working people is the glorious national duty of the working people of the German Democratic Republic." The bill also made the following addition to Article 112 of the Constitution: Legislative power regarding the military defense of the motherland and the protection of citizens falls within the jurisdiction of the Republic. The organization of the work of defending the motherland and protecting citizens will be implemented in accordance with the decisions of the Council of Ministers.

    民主德国人民议院举行会议
    通过德意志民主共和国和苏联关系条约
    新华社柏林二十七日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院会议二十六日在柏林开幕。会议议程包括下列问题：德意志民主共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟关系条约；一读和二读宪法补充法案；一读和二读德意志民主共和国国徽和国旗法案等。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在会议上发表了关于德意志民主共和国和苏联关系条约的政府声明。
    格罗提渥首先指出：德意志民主共和国和苏联关系条约证明了两国的关系如何在无私的友谊基础上发展。它从日内瓦会议的精神中产生，并且为日内瓦会议所导向的缓和与谅解而服务。全德人民必须利用这个时机为民族的福利、为国家在和平和民主的基础上获得统一而努力。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国和苏联关系条约的缔结，将在很大程度上促使其他国家承认德意志民主共和国。
    格罗提渥欢迎苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系的决定。他说：在两个德意志国家在莫斯科同苏联举行谈判以后，对于每一个希望统一的人来说，问题已经更加清楚。除了同德意志民主共和国谈判以外，没有别的道路。德国的重新统一是德国人自己的事情。“实力政策”已经在日内瓦告终，并且在莫斯科被埋葬了。剩下的唯一可行的道路，就是两个德国政府经过谅解和谈判以求得统一。我们一直在准备举行这种谈判。
    格罗提渥接着详细阐明条约的内容，并且指出：这个条约是一个历史性的文件。这个条约和莫斯科谈判使我们大家日益确信：德意志民主共和国的成就和我们国家的社会主义基础已经有了保证，而且永远也不会予以放弃。格罗提渥最后说：这个条约有助于我们祖国的统一，因为它鼓舞了在进行着争取统一的斗争的德国西部的进步力量。因此，我们号召全德人民共同加强努力，以争取这项伟大事业的实现，把德国重新建成为统一的、独立的、民主的和爱好和平的国家。
    接着开始讨论。德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希代表德国统一社会党议会党团、副总理努舍克代表基督教民主联盟议会党团、副总理兼外交部长博尔茨代表德国国家民主党议会党团相继发言，德国自由民主党总书记吉尔拉赫、民主农民党总书记罗斯、民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团主席柯伦斯及其他群众的代表也先后发了言。所有发言的人都赞同格罗提渥所作的政府声明。人民议院各党团代表们表示感谢苏联对德意志民主共和国的友好态度。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院一致通过德意志民主共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟关系条约，大厅中所有出席的人以暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声来欢迎人民议院的这个决定。
    人民议院随后转入讨论其他问题，听取了德意志民主共和国副总理斯多夫的发言，并且通过了宪法补充法案。这个法案对宪法第五条作了下列补充：“为保卫祖国和劳动人民的成果而服役是德意志民主共和国劳动人民的光荣的民族义务。”法案还对宪法第一百一十二条作了下列补充：关于军事上保卫祖国和保护公民方面的立法权力列入共和国的权限之内。组织保卫祖国和保护公民的工作将根据部长会议的决议来实现。
