    Many women activists in Tianjin are leading housewives to conscientiously implement grain consumption plans. Some housewives are even saving grain within the government-approved planned grain consumption amount. According to statistics from the Gansu Road Street Office in Tianjin, the average grain consumption per resident in the entire street was 24.9 catties in May, which decreased to just over 22 catties in July and August.

    In the grain conservation movement, these 300-plus women activists often use methods such as reading newspapers, holding discussion forums, and visiting households to promote the significance of conserving grain, introduce their own experiences in setting grain consumption plans and conserving grain, and help the housewives in their neighborhoods formulate grain consumption plans. In the family of Tong Yuguang, an activist, there are three adults and three children. In the past, they consumed an average of 23.5 catties of grain per person per month. During the grain conservation movement, she paid attention to reducing waste from washing rice, cooking rice, children eating, and handling leftovers, and came up with some ways to conserve grain, saving more than eight yuan on rice purchases in July and August. Some housewives in the neighborhood learned from her experience after hearing Tong Yuguang's introduction. In July, the grain consumption plans set by more than 40 households of employees of the Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory were generally on the high side, but with the help of activist Song Da Niang, most of them revised their grain consumption plans. Activist Lu Guizhen introduced to the masses her experience of making monthly, or weekly grain consumption plans based on the total monthly planned grain consumption amount, and cooking each meal according to the planned quantity. Many housewives emulated her method and implemented the grain consumption plans.

    天津许多妇女积极分子带动家庭主妇节约粮食
    天津市甘肃路街办事处所属范围内的三百多名妇女积极分子，带动家庭主妇认真执行了用粮计划。有些主妇还在政府批准的计划用粮数内节约了粮食。据街办事处统计，全街每个居民五月份平均用粮二十四点九斤，七、八两月份降到二十二斤多。
    这三百多名妇女积极分子，在节约粮食运动中，常常通过读报、座谈、挨户访问等方式，向群众宣传节约粮食的意义，介绍自己订用粮计划和节约粮食的经验，帮助附近的家庭主妇们制定用粮计划。积极分子童玉光的家里有三个大人和三个小孩，过去平均每人每月用粮二十三斤半，在节约粮食运动中她注意从淘米、煮饭、小孩吃饭和处理剩饭中减少浪费，并想出一些办法节约粮食，七、八两月省下了八元多的买米钱。附近有些家庭主妇听了童玉光的介绍后，都学习了她的经验。天津染整厂的四十多户职工家属七月份订的用粮计划普遍偏高，但她们在积极分子宋大娘帮助下，大都修改了用粮计划。积极分子卢桂珍向群众介绍了她根据全月的计划用粮量，作出每旬或每周的用粮计划，和每餐按量作饭的经验，很多家庭主妇仿效了她的办法，贯彻执行了用粮计划。　（新华社）
