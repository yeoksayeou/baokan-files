Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 16th: "The Times of India" on September 16th expressed concern about the developments in the meeting in Geneva between the ambassadors of China and the United States on the second item on the agenda. The newspaper said that the United States insists that further negotiations depend on China first fulfilling the agreement on the repatriation of civilians of both sides. This approach "may actually hinder further progress." The newspaper said that this development "caused unexpected disappointment in New Delhi."
    The newspaper said that India had hoped that the agreement on the repatriation of civilians of both sides would pave the way for discussions on the more important second item on the agenda - in particular, discussions on whether it would be appropriate to reach a principled agreement on holding a high-level Sino-US meeting.

    “印度时报”批评美国对中美会谈的态度
    新华社新德里十六日电  “印度时报”十六日对中美两国大使在日内瓦就第二项议程举行会谈的发展情况表示关切。报纸说，美国坚持进一步的谈判要取决于中国首先履行关于双方平民回国问题的协议。这种作法“可能实际上阻碍进一步的进展”。报纸说，这种发展情况“使新德里感到出乎意料之外的失望”。
    报纸说，印度曾经希望，关于双方平民回国问题的协议将为讨论更重要的第二项议程——特别是讨论是否宜于就举行中美高级会议达成原则的协议一事扫清道路。
