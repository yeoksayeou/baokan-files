    Chongqing Builds New Cotton Waste Processing Plant

    A new cotton waste processing plant in Chongqing officially began production recently. Most of the machinery and equipment in this plant were converted from idle materials and stockpiled equipment from various cotton textile factories in Chongqing, with a total investment of only more than 180,000 yuan.

    The task of the cotton waste processing plant is to reprocess the cotton waste left over from the removal of impurities in cotton textile factories into useful raw materials. In the process of spinning cotton into fine yarn, cotton textile factories must remove the impurities contained in the cotton. When removing impurities, some very short cotton fibers are dropped along with the impurities. In the past, some of these cotton scraps were burned by workers as firewood, and some were sold at very low prices to warehouses to line bags and floors. According to the Southwest Textile Administration's statistics for the six cotton textile factories in the Chongqing area alone, more than 1,000 tons of cotton scraps were lost each year. Now that this cotton waste processing plant has been built, it can increase the country's wealth by more than one million yuan a year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重庆新建一座落棉加工厂
    重庆市新建的一座落棉加工厂在最近正式开工投入生产。这个厂的大部分机器设备都是利用重庆各棉纺织厂的呆滞物资和积压器材改装而成的，全部投资只花了十八万多元。
    落棉加工厂的任务，是将棉纺织厂里从清除杂质中剩下来的下脚棉重新加工成为有用的原料。棉纺织厂里在把棉花纺成细纱的生产过程中，必须把含在棉花当中的杂质除掉，清除杂质的时候，有些很短的棉花纤维就随同杂质一起掉下来了。以往，这些下脚棉有的给工人当柴烧掉，有的以极低的价格卖给仓库里垫口袋、垫地板。仅据西南纺织管理局所属重庆地区六个棉纺织厂计算，一年损失的下脚棉就有一千多吨。现在这座落棉加工厂建成后，一年就能为国家增加一百多万元的财富。（新华社）
