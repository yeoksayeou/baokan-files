    Sino-US ambassadorial talks, which began in Geneva on August 1st, reached an agreement on the first item on the agenda—the return of civilians to their respective countries—on the 10th of this month. This is a good start. It helps to promote reconciliation and create an atmosphere of mutual trust between China and the United States. This is beneficial to improving relations between China and the United States.
    The Sino-US ambassadorial talks followed closely after the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference. The Geneva Conference opened the way to eliminate the "Cold War" and ease international tensions. The path pointed out by the Geneva Conference, as well as the spirit of reconciliation and construction it established, could not but have a positive impact on the Sino-US talks.
    During the month-long negotiation process, both China and the United States made necessary efforts to reach an agreement on the first item on the agenda. It is quite obvious that without the necessary spirit of cooperation, if not trying to bring each other's views closer, it would be impossible to reach an agreement. This once again confirms that as long as both sides have the sincerity to solve problems, any international dispute can be resolved through negotiation.
    The efforts made by the Chinese government to seek an agreement on the first item on the agenda have been recognized by international public opinion. Before the start of these negotiations, China released eleven American pilots who had committed espionage crimes in advance. Not long ago, China also announced measures to deal with twelve American citizens applying to leave the country. These actions undoubtedly had a good impetus to the progress of the negotiations. However, some American newspapers deliberately distorted the efforts made by the Chinese side. They even said that the Chinese side was eager to discuss the second item on the agenda, and that the Chinese side attempted to use the reaching of an agreement on the second item as a condition for resolving the first item. Now, the facts have proved that this malicious distortion is without any basis. In fact, only the efforts of both parties can reach an agreement, and the agreement must be beneficial to both parties. Reaching an agreement on the first item is not only in China's interest, but also in the interest of the United States.
    Now, an agreement has been reached on the issue of the return of civilians to their respective countries. We expect the agreement to be implemented smoothly without any obstacles. The Chinese side will earnestly implement this agreement in accordance with its consistent attitude of firmly abiding by international agreements. At the same time, after the agreement is reached, other practical issues on which the two sides have disputes—the second item on the agenda of the talks—will enter into discussion. In order to make the talks a complete success, and to contribute to easing the tension between China and the United States, both sides should continue their efforts to seek an agreement, so that this ambassadorial-level meeting can pave the way for further negotiations between China and the United States.
    Everyone knows that to ease the situation in Asia, one cannot but touch upon the issue of improving Sino-US relations. Improving Sino-US relations has become the main condition for consolidating peace in Asia and the Pacific region. This is why international public opinion attaches such great importance to the Sino-US talks. People of all countries, especially the people of Asia, hope that this meeting will lead to the improvement of Sino-US relations, so that some urgent Far Eastern issues can be resolved. The "Indian Times" said that this negotiation is "the first independent diplomatic contact between China and the United States, and will undoubtedly be the first step towards further consultations on political issues in the East." The British "Manchester Guardian" believes that the ambassador-level negotiations "have moderate and direct goals, and if these goals are achieved, they can lead to continuous negotiations, which may lead to the resolution of major issues." Some realistic American politicians also believe that it is necessary to continue to take steps to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries. We believe that all these propositions reflect the peace aspirations of the people of the world, and at the same time, they add to the responsibility of China and the United States to continue to strive for an agreement on the second item on the agenda. The Chinese people welcome the agreement reached by the Sino-US ambassadorial talks on the first item on the agenda, and are willing to make their due efforts to further improve Sino-US relations.

### 中美会谈就双方平民回国问题达成协议

    中美会谈就双方平民回国问题达成协议
    八月一日在日内瓦开始的中美大使级的谈判，已于本月十日就第一项议程——双方平民回国问题——取得协议。这是一个良好的开端。它有助于促进和解并创造中美之间相互信任的气氛。这对于改进中国和美国的关系是有利的。
    中美两国大使级会谈，是紧接着日内瓦四国政府首脑会议之后举行的。日内瓦会议为消除“冷战”、和缓国际局势开辟了道路。日内瓦会议所指出的道路以及它所树立的和解气氛和建设性的精神，不能不对中美会谈发生有利的影响。
    在一个多月的谈判过程中，为了使第一项议程取得协议，中美双方都作了必要的努力。十分明显，如果没有应有的合作精神，如果不是设法使彼此间的观点趋于接近，要想达成协议是不可能的。这就再一次确定地证明，只要双方都有解决问题的诚意，任何国际纠纷都可以通过协商方式得到解决。
    中国政府为谋求第一项议程取得协议所作的努力，已为各国舆论所公认。在这次谈判开始之前，中国提前释放十一名犯有间谍罪的美国飞行员。前不久，中国又宣布对十二名申请出境的美侨处理办法。这一些行动无疑地对谈判的进展产生了良好的推动作用。但是，某些美国报纸却故意歪曲中国方面所作的努力，他们甚至说中国方面要急于讨论第二项议程，中国方面企图以对第二项议程的达成协议为解决第一项议程的条件。现在，事实证明这种恶意的歪曲是没有任何根据的。事实上，只有双方的努力才能达成协议，而协议又必然是对于双方有利的。第一项议程的取得协议，不仅符合于中国的利益，同样地也是符合美国方面的利益的。
    现在，双方平民回国问题已经达成了协议。我们期待协议将得到顺利实施而不致有阻挠的情况发生。中国方面将本着坚决遵守国际协议的一贯态度，认真地执行这个协议。同时，在这项协议达成之后，双方有所争执的其他实际问题——会谈的第二项议程——即将进入讨论。为了使会谈得到圆满成功，为了对和缓中美之间的紧张局势作出贡献，双方谋求协议的努力都应该继续下去，使这一次的大使级会谈能够为中美之间的更进一步的谈判开辟道路。
    谁都知道，要和缓亚洲局势，就不能不接触到改进中美关系的问题。改进中美关系已成为巩固亚洲和太平洋地区和平的主要条件。这就是为什么各国舆论，对中美会谈寄予如此巨大的关切的原因。各国人民，特别是亚洲人民希望这次会议引导到中美关系的改善，从而使一些迫切的远东问题得到解决。“印度时报”说，这次谈判是中美两国之间“第一次独立的外交接触，并且无疑将是走向关于东方的政治问题的进一步协商的第一个步骤”。英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”认为这次大使一级的谈判，“有着适度的、直接的目标，如果这些目标达到的话，就可以导致继续不断的谈判，从而可能获得主要问题的解决。”一些具有现实感的美国政治家，也认为有必要继续采取步骤，来解决两国之间悬而未决的问题。我们认为，所有这些主张反映了世界人民的和平愿望，同时也加重了中美双方继续努力寻求对第二项议程达成协议的责任。中国人民欢迎中美两国大使级会谈在第一项议程中所达成的协议，并愿为进一步改进中美关系作出他们应作的努力。
