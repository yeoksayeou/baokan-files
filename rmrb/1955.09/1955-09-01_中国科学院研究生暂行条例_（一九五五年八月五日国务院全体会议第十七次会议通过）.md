Article 10 Employees who are permitted to take the graduate entrance examination shall be granted one to two months of leave by their employing agency to prepare for the examination.

Chapter III Training of Graduate Students

Article 11 The duration of study for graduate students shall generally be four years. In special circumstances, with the approval of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the duration may be appropriately extended or shortened, but the extension period shall not exceed one year.

Article 12 After admission, each graduate student shall be assigned a research fellow as their academic advisor (with the approval of the academic division, associate research fellows may also serve as academic advisors). Graduate students shall conduct their studies and research under the guidance of their academic advisors. Academic division members, members of institute academic committees who do not work at research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other experts outside the Chinese Academy of Sciences may, with their consent and the consent of their employing agency, be entrusted by the institute to serve as academic advisors. Each academic advisor shall, in principle, guide no more than five graduate students at the same time.

Article 13 The primary method of training graduate students is to conduct independent work under the guidance of their academic advisors, according to individual plans. The content of a graduate student's individual plan shall include the following:

(1) One or two basic professional courses and one professional course related to the thesis;

(2) Dialectical materialism and historical materialism;

(3) Russian and one other foreign language (other foreign language study may be waived with special approval from the Chinese Academy of Sciences);

(4) Thesis.

The graduate student's individual plan shall be formulated under the guidance of the academic advisor, and the plan shall specify the content and deadlines for each stage of study or work. The academic advisor shall propose the required courses within two months of admission, and the thesis plan shall be proposed one year before the start of the thesis work. The graduate student's individual plan shall be reviewed by the institute's academic committee, approved by the institute director, and reported to the academic division for record-keeping; the procedures for modifying the plan are the same.

Article 14 The selection of topics for graduate students' theses should proceed from the needs of national construction and scientific development, and should be related to the development direction of the institute. The thesis must propose new theoretical or practical research results in the student's specialty. Thesis topics should be included as part of the institute's research plan.

Article 15 Graduate students should generally complete the required courses within two years and take examinations within the time frame specified in their individual plans. The examinations shall be conducted by the institute's academic committee. Those who fail the examination may take a make-up examination with the approval of the institute. Those who fail the make-up examination shall not be allowed to participate in the thesis defense. Thesis work should begin no later than the beginning of the third year.

Article 16 Graduate students must, every six months, report on the implementation of their individual plans and their learning experiences within their research office or research group, and submit a written summary after discussion within the research office or research group, which will be submitted to the institute's academic committee for review.

Article 17 At the end of each academic year, the graduate student's academic advisor must provide an evaluation of the graduate student, which will be submitted to the institute's academic committee for review. The evaluation should reflect the graduate student's research capabilities, the status of their professional course studies, and the degree of preparation for their thesis.

Article 18 After a graduate student has passed the examinations specified in their individual plan and completed their thesis, they should submit the thesis and its abstract to their academic advisor for review. The institute shall then send the thesis or thesis abstract to relevant experts for comments, and finally, the institute's academic committee shall review and decide whether to propose a defense. The original manuscript of the thesis shall be submitted to the institute's library for archival purposes.

Article 19 After a graduate student's thesis has been reviewed and approved for defense, the institute's academic committee shall appoint one or two rebuttal experts from among experts other than the graduate student's academic advisor. The date of the defense shall be determined through consultation between the institute and the rebuttal experts. At least one month before the defense, the institute shall distribute the thesis or thesis abstract to relevant experts and agencies, and announce the date of the defense. Anyone who wishes to attend the defense meeting may do so with the approval of the institute.

Article 20 The thesis defense shall be held at a meeting of the institute's academic committee, which shall be chaired by the institute director. After the thesis defense, it must be approved by a majority vote of the institute's academic committee members in a secret ballot. Before the vote, the academic committee should exchange opinions with the rebuttal experts.

Article 21 After a graduate student's thesis has been approved, the institute shall submit it to the academic division for review and report it to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for approval of graduation and award of the degree of Associate Doctor of Science. Graduate students whose theses are not approved may, within the period of study specified in Article 11 of these Regulations, revise their theses under the guidance of their academic advisors and prepare for a second defense, with the approval of the institute upon review by the academic division and reported to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The date of the second defense shall not be later than one year from the date of the first defense.

Article 22 In any of the following circumstances, the institute shall propose, upon review by the academic division and with the approval of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to revoke the graduate student's qualification:

(1) Exhibiting a lack of scientific research ability and being formally proposed by the academic advisor;

(2) Failing to pass the required course examinations;

(3) Failing to submit the thesis on time;

(4) Failing to pass the thesis defense twice.

Chapter IV Treatment and Job Assignment of Graduate Students

Article 23 The task of graduate students is to study, and they shall not undertake tasks other than research work during their period of study.

Article 24 Graduate students shall enjoy state financial aid and a certain amount of vacation time each year. Graduate students who continue to receive wages from their original work units shall not be granted financial aid.

Article 25 Graduate students shall have the right to use the relevant equipment of the institute and participate in various academic and social activities within the institute.

Article 26 The research unit where the graduate student is located shall be responsible for supplying the necessary data funding for the preparation of the graduate student's thesis.

Article 27 A graduate student's thesis may be published in the journal of the research unit where they are located, or be recommended by the research unit for publication in publications of the Chinese Academy of Sciences or other relevant academic journals, after the thesis has been approved by the defense and revised under the guidance of the advisor, taking into account the opinions of the rebutters; however, this shall not apply to content involving state secrets.

Article 28 After graduation, graduate students shall be assigned work by the government in a unified manner, except for those who retain their original positions and return to their original work units.
