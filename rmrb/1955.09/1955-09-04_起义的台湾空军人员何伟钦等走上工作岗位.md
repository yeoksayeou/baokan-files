    新华社一日讯　驾机起义飞回祖国大陆的前台湾蒋军空军人员何伟钦、黄铁骏、刘若龙、宋宝荣等，在回家探亲和到各地参观游览后，在一日分别走上新的工作和学习岗位。
    依据他们自己的申请，何伟钦、黄铁骏等参加了中央国防体育俱乐部滑翔学校的工作，刘若龙被分配到中国民用航空局工作，宋宝荣到轻工业部的机械学校读书。
    何伟钦等对于人民政府分配他们工作都感到非常兴奋，一致表示要积极工作和学习，献身于祖国建设事业，来答谢政府和人民给他们的关怀。何伟钦说：中央国防体育俱乐部滑翔学校是我国新创立的第一个滑翔学校，我们有机会到这个学校去工作，感到非常光荣和高兴。宋宝荣兴奋地说：我少年时就有学习工科当个工程人员的愿望，在旧社会，我的愿望没有变成现实。这次架机起义归来后，这个愿望已实现了。
