    To greet the National Congress of Active Young Builders, young people in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Shandong, Zhejiang, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other places are presenting new labor achievements as gifts to the congress.
    In order to welcome the convening of the congress, workers in a youth splicing group at the Changchun Plywood Factory actively promoted advanced experiences and overfulfilled production tasks for two consecutive months. The Wang Youren Youth Shock Team of the Jilin Basic Construction Second Engineering Company put forward eight rationalization proposals in sixteen days and also improved four kinds of tools, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. Teng Guozhang, a young worker in Jilin City, created an automatic riveting machine, increasing efficiency twenty times.
    Members of the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team in Luobei County, Heilongjiang Province, decided to reclaim 1,500 mu of wasteland during the National Congress of Active Young Builders as a gift to the congress. To ensure the completion of this glorious task, they launched a labor competition on September 15. On the first day of the competition, the area of wasteland reclaimed by each reclamation plow exceeded the maximum area reclaimed by each plow per day by local farmers.
    In Hubei Province's industrial system, more than 8,000 young workers have formed more than 230 youth conservation teams to collect waste materials. Currently, more than 800 young conservation team members at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site have recovered approximately 100,000 kilograms of scrap steel. Youth conservation team members in various factories and mines in Huangshi City have recovered waste materials and old materials worth more than 80,000 yuan. Zhang Yun, a young seaman in Yichang City, recently proposed two rationalization proposals regarding adjusting shipping routes and increasing gasoline loading capacity, which could increase national income by more than 110,000 yuan per year. More than 140 young men and women shock team members of the Jinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luotian County, under the slogan of "Expand cultivated land area and strive for a bumper harvest," reclaimed more than 30 mu of wasteland in three days; they cut more than 600,000 catties of green grass and accumulated more than 50,000 catties of fertilizer in half a month.
    Li Lianzhu, a young worker at the Shandong State-owned Guangbei Mechanized Farm, diligently studied advanced Soviet experience, and in 1953 and 1954, he continuously exceeded the farm's cotton picking quota, creating new cotton picking records. Recently, in welcoming the National Congress of Active Young Builders, he completed this year's cotton picking task with a 60% excess.
    Youth conservation teams and youth shock teams have been widely established in factories, mines, and basic construction sites throughout Zhejiang Province. The 87 youth conservation teams and 14 youth supervision posts established in Hangzhou City have a total of more than 1,500 team members and post members. Through their activities, they have saved assets worth more than 75,000 yuan for the country.
    Six youth conservation teams of the Timber Processing Factory and Tool Repair Factory under the Inner Mongolia Directly Subordinate Engineering Company utilized their spare time to reorganize warehouses and utilize waste products from June to August, reducing costs by 75% and saving more than 4,000 yuan for the country.
    More than 3,000 young people in various factories and mines in Xinjiang have participated in youth conservation teams. The conservation team at the Xinjiang Machine Factory, with 260 young people, had recovered a total of 16 tons of scrap iron and more than 9 tons of crushed coke by the first half of August, and also saved many other raw materials, saving the country 9,450 yuan. The conservation team composed of sixteen young people in the power workshop of the Xinjiang Cement Factory has repaired fifty-three large and small magnetic bottles and four hundred meters of discarded wire since June.
    The forty-four young activists from Beijing who are attending the National Congress of Active Young Builders have made new contributions to production on the eve of the congress's opening. The blast furnace managed by Li Youzhi, a young activist and deputy foreman of the Iron Smelting Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, has recently produced more than ten tons of pig iron per day more than planned for a week. He only left his production post to prepare for the congress after personally watching a furnace of red-hot molten iron flow out on the afternoon of the 17th. From September 1st to 17th, Ti Baotian, a young worker at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, led a youth conservation team to utilize more than nine tons of scrap steel, saving the country more than 5,000 yuan.
    The Sun Yutian team of the youth steelmaking class at the State-owned Tianjin Steel Plant aims to increase the number of rapid steelmaking furnaces planned for September by 10%, and shorten the smelting time by ten minutes per shift compared to the plan. By the 12th, they had completed more than 62% of the planned number of rapid steelmaking furnaces, and the quality was also up to standard. The Haiou (Seagull) work team of the State-owned Tianjin Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, where Sun Hongmin, a delegate to the National Congress of Active Young Builders, is located, has achieved its guarantee to reduce defective yarn in order to welcome the congress. Currently, they are producing sixty to one hundred and twenty fewer defective yarns per day than planned. The twenty-three youth groups and youth shock teams on various construction sites throughout the city have formulated advanced production plans for the middle ten days of the month after overfulfilling their production tasks for the first ten days of September.
    The young workers of Chongqing No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant have created more than 100 excellent production achievements as a gift to the National Congress of Active Young Builders. The youth rolling steel class of the casting workshop of Chongqing No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant completed thirty-one days of production tasks in twenty days in August. Ninety-five percent of the Communist Youth League members and more than half of the young workers of Tianfu Coal Mine participated in the production activities to greet the congress, and they are conscientiously implementing their "meritorious service plans."
