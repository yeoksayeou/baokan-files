    The Guanting Hydropower Station Under Construction
    Yu Qing
    Along the recently opened Fengtai-Shacheng Railway, visitors to the Guanting Reservoir are drawn to another new construction project: the Guanting Hydropower Station, which is currently under construction.
    Sailing south on the vast "Lake Guanting," one can see the recently completed gateway to the hydropower station—the intake structure. Following the intake is a circular diversion tunnel, six meters in diameter (after lining) and 770 meters long. Since the tunnel was opened this spring, workers have been working hard on the tunnel lining. This project is very arduous; when lining the top arch, workers must often operate in a crawling or lying position for long periods. However, the workers have been working happily and finding ways to overcome various difficulties. Worker Chen Huankun created the "tapered groove rolling material method," which eliminates cracks at the joints between new and old concrete and saves a great deal of cement and labor. The lining project requires a large amount of rebar every day. In the past, straightening and bending rebar was mostly done manually, which was inefficient, of poor quality, and tiring for the workers. Rebar worker Chen Zhonghua, after a long period of research, used old machine parts to create a "rebar straightening machine." Work that used to take three technicians seven months to complete can now be done in one month using the "rebar straightening machine," and the quality is better than manual operation. Thanks to the workers' active efforts, the planned tasks for the tunnel lining project were overfulfilled in June and July, and by the end of August, the entire project was 73 percent complete.
    A hilltop above the diversion tunnel is the site of the hydropower station's surge tank. Workers must dig a large vertical shaft more than 20 meters deep from the top of this hill and connect it to the tunnel to regulate water pressure and protect the safety of buildings and generators. During the excavation process, drillers created drilling methods such as "double-hole operation" and "pre-fixed blast holes." Youth shock brigade members Li Shengbao and Zhang Zhiliang drilled 31.4 meters in one shift, exceeding the quota by nearly double. Currently, more than two-thirds of the surge tank has been excavated.
    Along the reservoir dam, through a mountain valley road opened up by stonemasons, one arrives at another main project under construction—the power plant building. Two months ago, the sound of blasting here could no longer be heard, as the excavation of the plant site had been completed. Next to the flattened steep walls, dense scaffolding has been erected, and a reinforced concrete power plant building over 30 meters high is under construction. In order to accelerate the progress of the project, the workers actively find ways to overcome difficulties and often work in the rain. When pouring concrete in a certain area, the water used to cure the concrete kept flowing down, making it difficult to carry out the work below. Wang Shoushan and Ma Chang'an, members of the steel bar youth commando team, used their own clothes to absorb the water. It was late at night, and the cold wind was blowing, but they persevered and completed the task. Thanks to the selfless spirit of all the employees, the reinforced concrete work of the generator floor of the main plant building has been successfully completed. Installation workers have promptly erected tall cranes and many lifting equipment here, and steel pipes and machine parts weighing several tons have been installed in the designated positions. The "cone ring" and "seat ring" of the third generator have been installed. Soon, China's own giant hydroelectric generators will be transported to Guanting and installed here.
    Now, most of the earth and stone work of the hydropower station has been completed, and all projects are progressing rapidly. The day when the hydropower station will generate electricity is not far off. At that time, the rapid current of the Yongding River will pass through the diversion tunnel and enter the plant building with the force of ten thousand horses, driving the generators to rotate. Inexpensive electricity will be sent from Guanting to support the increasingly developed industrial production and urban construction in the capital and other places.

    建设中的官厅水电站
    宇清
    沿着不久前通车的丰沙铁路，到官厅水库来参观的人们，被另一个新的建设工程吸引着。这项工程就是正在建设中的官厅水电站。
    在广阔的“官厅湖”上，驾舟南望，可以看到最近完工的水电站的大门——进水口工程。通过进水口，紧接着的就是直径六公尺（衬砌后）、长七百七十公尺的圆形引水隧洞。从今年春天这条隧洞打通以后，工人们就开始在这里紧张地进行隧洞衬砌工作。这项工程很艰巨，在衬砌顶拱的时候，工人们还需要长时间爬卧着操作。但是工人们一直愉快地工作着，并且想办法克服了各种困难。工人陈焕坤创造了“减筍槽滚料法”，使新旧混凝土结茬处没有裂缝，并节省了许多水泥和工人。衬砌工程每天需要大量钢筋，过去平直和弯曲钢筋，大都用人工操作，效率低，质量不好，工人也很劳累。钢筋工陈忠华经过长时间研究，利用旧机件制成了“直铁机”。过去三个技工用七个月时间才能完成的工作，使用“直铁机”，一个月就可以完成，而且质量比人工操作好。由于工人们的积极努力，六七月份隧洞衬砌工程的计划任务都超额完成了，到八月底，全部工程已经完成了百分之七十三。
    引水隧洞上面的一个山头，是水电站的调压井工地。工人们要从这个山顶上向下挖一个二十多公尺深的大直筒，并且要和隧洞接通，用以调节水压，保护建筑物和发电机的安全。在开挖过程中，钻工们创造了“双孔作业”、“预先固定炮眼”的打钻方法。青年突击队员李生宝和张之良，一班就打进了三十一点四公尺，突破定额近一倍。目前，调压井已经挖下三分之二以上。
    沿着水库拦河坝，穿过一条石工们开辟的山谷公路，就来到了正在施工的另一主体工程——发电厂房。两个月以前，这里的开山炮声就已经听不到了，开挖厂址的工程已经完成。在削平的陡壁旁边，树立起了密密麻麻的脚手架，一座三十多公尺高的钢筋混凝土结构的发电厂房正在建筑。为了加速工程进度，工人们积极设法克服困难，并且经常冒雨施工。在浇注某处的混凝土的时候，养护混凝土的水不断往下流，下面的工程难以进行。钢筋青年突击队队员王寿山和马长安就用自己的衣服把水吸尽。那时候，正是深夜，寒风嗖嗖地吹着，但他们坚持完成了任务。由于全体职工抱着这样忘我的精神来进行劳动，现在主厂房发电机层的钢筋混凝土工程已经顺利完成。安装工人们及时在这里架起了高大的起重机和很多吊装设备，数吨重的钢管和机件已经安装在规定的位置。第三台发电机的“锥形环”和“座环”已经安装完毕。不久，我国自制的巨型水力发电机就要运到官厅，在这里安装。
    现在，水电站的土石方工程大部分已经完工了，各项工程都在迅速地进展着。水电站发电的日子不久就要到来了。那时候，永定河的急流将以万马奔腾之势，穿过引水隧洞进入厂房，推动发电机运转。廉价的电能就将从官厅发出，支援首都等地日益发展的工业生产和城市建设。
