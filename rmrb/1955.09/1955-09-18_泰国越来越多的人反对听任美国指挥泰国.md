Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 17th: The Indian weekly "Delhi Times" recently published a dispatch from its Bangkok correspondent stating that the vast majority of the people of Thailand do not approve of the policy of allowing the United States to command Thailand.

    The "Delhi Times" pointed out that according to the agreement signed between the United States and Thailand in 1950, Thailand promised to open its domestic market to American goods, support American policies in diplomacy, expand its army to 200,000 men, and allow the United States to send advisors and experts to Thailand.

    The "Delhi Times" said that due to the dumping of American manufactured goods, Thai industry is facing a serious crisis. Up to three-quarters of Thai textile factories are about to close, which has caused serious unemployment problems. The weekly also said that since American "aid" began to arrive in Thailand, Thailand's rice exports have decreased by 25 percent, timber exports by 30 percent, and tobacco exports by 50 percent.

    The "Delhi Times" continued by saying that because Thailand has become a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, its military expenditures have increased sharply, totaling about 60 percent of the national budget. Thailand also needs to spend 128,370,600 baht to maintain American military and technical delegations. The "Delhi Times" quoted the Thai newspaper "Democracy" as saying, "Judging from everything in Thailand, the country seems to be in a state of war."

    The "Delhi Times" said: "The vast majority of Thai residents do not approve of the policy of allowing the United States to command Thailand." The weekly also said that this opinion is becoming increasingly prominent in Thai business circles and even within the ruling group, namely that the safest way to alleviate Thailand's serious economic crisis is to reject American "aid" and adopt the anti-colonial policies commonly adopted by Asian countries.

    The "Delhi Times" concluded by saying that many political figures are in favor of Thailand adopting the Five Principles announced by Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai.

    泰国越来越多的人反对听任美国指挥泰国
    新华社新德里十七日电  印度“德里时代”周刊最近一期发表它驻曼谷记者的电讯说：泰国绝大部分人民不赞成听任美国指挥泰国的政策。
    “德里时代”指出，根据美国和泰国在一九五○年签订的协定，泰国答应开放国内市场让美国货物进口，在外交方面支持美国的政策，把陆军扩充到二十万人，并且允许美国派遣顾问和专家到泰国。
    “德里时代”说，由于美国制成品的倾销，泰国工业正面对着严重的危机。泰国纺织工厂关闭的将要达到四分之三，这引起了严重的失业问题。这家周刊还说，自从美国“援助”开始到泰国以来，泰国的大米出口已经减少了百分之二十五，木材出口减少了百分之三十，烟草出口减少了百分之五十。
    “德里时代”接着说，由于泰国成为东南亚条约组织的一个成员，它的军事支出猛烈地增加，其总数约占国家预算的百分之六十。泰国还需要支出泰币一亿二千八百三十七万零六百铢来维持美国的军事代表团和技术代表团。“德里时代”援引泰国报纸“民主报”的话说：“从泰国的每一件事情看来，国家好像处在战争状态中。”
    “德里时代”说：“泰国居民绝大多数不赞成听任美国指挥泰国的那种政策。”这家周刊还说，在泰国商界以至在统治集团内部，这种意见愈来愈有地位，即缓和泰国严重经济危机的最安全的道路就是拒绝美国的“援助”，并且采取亚洲国家所共同采取的反殖民主义政策。
    “德里时代”最后说，许多政界人士的意见是赞成泰国采纳尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理所宣布的五项原则的。
