Implement the "Three Fixes" Policy for Grain to Households

    Do a Good Job in Grain Rationing
    Xin Qi

    The "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas" issued by the State Council on August 25 made clear provisions for unified grain sales in rural areas. That is, under the principle of unified arrangement for grain purchase and sale in rural areas, based on the grain production, purchase, and sale figures assigned to the townships before and after the spring plowing in 1955, combined with the actual situation, after verifying the output and stipulating grain consumption standards, calculate the grain consumption per household, and divide households into surplus grain households, self-sufficient households, and grain-deficient households at one time based on the yield minus grain consumption and actual public grain payment. For grain-deficient households that produce grain and rural residents who do not produce grain, the amount of grain that must be supplied by the state is stipulated at one time, and the state issues grain supply certificates, and then supplies grain "with certificates, monthly, at fixed points, and in fixed quantities." The grain supply amount for grain-deficient households is evaluated once a year. With these regulations, the rational supply of grain needed by the 100 million grain-deficient people in rural areas will be more reliably guaranteed.

    Two years of experience have proven that to do a good job in unified grain sales in rural areas, unified grain purchase must be closely combined with unified grain sales. That is to say, the line between surplus and deficient grain should be drawn at one time, purchase and sale work should be arranged in a unified manner, those with surplus grain should be subject to unified purchase, those who are short of grain should be subject to unified sales, and the annual unified sales figures should be verified before spring plowing. The reason why the rural grain supply in some areas was once tense in March and April this year was partly because the grain purchase and sale work was not closely integrated. People who were short of grain suspected whether the state would guarantee the supply of grain, and thus their emotions were unstable; those who were not short of grain or even had surplus grain also said they were "short of grain," so that many people who should not have been supplied received supplies, those who should have been supplied less were supplied more, and some people who were truly short of grain did not receive timely supplies. After the implementation of grain rationing, these shortcomings can be avoided, and the state guarantees a reasonable supply to farmers who are truly short of grain.

    Why should the rationing figures for grain-deficient households in rural areas be evaluated once a year? This is because under the guidance of the Party and the People's Government's policies of rewarding agricultural production, and with the support of the state in water conservancy construction, agricultural loans, and other aspects, with the development of agricultural cooperativization, farmers' grain production will increase year by year, and many grain-deficient households will change from insufficient grain to self-sufficiency or even surplus. After one year, some grain-deficient households that produce grain will not need state supply, and some grain-deficient households may even sell part of their surplus grain. Therefore, it is completely reasonable to evaluate the rationing figures once a year.

    Everyone already knows that the state's unified grain purchase plan for this year is reduced compared to the past two years, and this figure will remain unchanged for three years. This is a major measure to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. To stabilize this reduced unified purchase figure, grain sales must be strictly controlled. If grain sales are not strictly controlled and exceed the state's plan, the result will inevitably increase the amount of unified purchase from farmers. Doing so will undermine the policy of increasing production without increasing purchases and keeping the unified purchase figure unchanged for three years. Obviously, this situation is very harmful to both the state and the farmers. Therefore, in addition to implementing quantitative grain supply in towns and strictly reducing unreasonable sales, grain rationing must also be implemented in rural areas. To do a good job in rural grain rationing, in-depth investigation and research work is necessary, and the masses must be fully mobilized for evaluation, so as to correctly verify the supply amount of grain-deficient households and verify the amount of grain that needs to be supplied to grain-deficient households in one year, so as to ensure that the state's sales plan is not broken and to ensure the implementation of the grain unified purchase and sale policy.

    In order to draw a clear line between surplus and deficient grain and correctly verify the supply quantity to grain-deficient households, it is necessary to rationally stipulate the grain consumption standards for various types of grain-deficient farmers based on the farmers' production and living conditions. First of all, it is necessary to stipulate the grain consumption standard for seeds. The amount of seeds used by farmers who produce grain in the same area is the same. Therefore, the amount of seeds retained by surplus grain households or grain-deficient households should be stipulated according to actual needs to ensure the needs of developing grain production. Secondly, the grain consumption standards for rations and feed must be determined according to the different specific conditions of various grain-deficient households. Generally, grain-deficient households in grain-producing areas have lower living conditions than local surplus grain households, so their grain consumption standards for rations and feed are naturally lower than those of local surplus grain households. For grain-deficient households that plant cash crops according to the national plan, the measures stipulate that their grain consumption standards for rations and feed "should not be lower than the grain consumption standards of local surplus grain households" in order to encourage farmers who plant cash crops to actively produce industrial raw materials to ensure the needs of national industrial production, which is reasonable. The measures stipulate that the grain consumption standards for rations and feed for grain-deficient households in disaster areas "should be lower than the grain consumption standards for grain-deficient households in normal years in the local area." Because farmers' actual living conditions are inevitably worse than those in normal years after suffering disasters, it is in line with the actual situation in disaster areas to stipulate that their grain consumption standards for rations and feed are lower than the standards for grain-deficient households in normal years. The measures stipulate that the grain consumption standards for rations and feed for the non-agricultural population in rural areas "should generally not exceed the grain consumption standards of local surplus grain households." The so-called non-agricultural population in rural areas generally refers to rural handicraftsmen, doctors, primary school teachers, small merchants and peddlers, etc. The labor of these people is directly serving the farmers, and at the same time, the living conditions of some of them are relatively high, so it is appropriate to set the grain consumption standards for rations and feed for these people appropriately higher, but not to make their grain consumption standards exceed the standards of local surplus grain households, which is also correct.

    After the rationing figures for grain-deficient households are determined, all grain-deficient farmers should purchase grain in the spirit of obeying the state plan and saving grain. First of all, grain-deficient households should obey the state's plan for supplying grain varieties. The measures stipulate that "the variety of grain supplied to grain-deficient households can be supplied according to the principle of what the state has available locally, and some potatoes can also be supplied. However, the state grain authorities should do their best to organize adjustments and appropriately take care of the needs of the masses." This provision takes into account both the state's possibilities and the needs of the grain-deficient people. Everyone should recognize that my country has a vast area, and the ripening seasons of grain crops and people's grain consumption habits are different in the south and the north. Although the state must do its utmost to organize the adjustment of grain varieties, it is still impossible to meet the needs of urban and rural consumers for grain varieties in any season. Therefore, grain-deficient households should understand the difficulties of the state and consciously change some living habits. They should eat whatever grain the state supplies.

    According to the provisions of the Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain in Rural Areas, the state should make reasonable arrangements for the time of grain supply to grain-deficient households. That is to say, the state grain authorities will, in the future, determine the time to start supplying grain to grain-deficient households separately according to the principle of when grain is deficient and when it is supplied, and make a monthly supply plan. This is very necessary. Two years of experience have told us that if a monthly supply plan is not made, some people may, under the influence of the idea of "eating the state's first and their own later," purchase a large amount of grain from the state in the first few months of the beginning of a year, so that the state's rural grain sales plan indicators are consumed in large quantities, and when the green and yellow are not connected and grain is truly deficient, the grain supplied is reduced instead, resulting in a tense phenomenon and excessive consumption of the state's inventory turnover grain. After a monthly supply plan is made according to the actual grain deficiency of grain-deficient households, on the one hand, the state grain authorities must organize the supply in a planned manner to ensure that the reasonable needs of grain-deficient households are met; on the other hand, grain-deficient households must eat their own grain first and the state's grain later, and try to save grain in various ways to ensure that the monthly grain supply plan is not broken. In this way, the rural grain unified sales work will have a stable order. For grain-deficient farmers, they can get supplies in time and will not delay time for purchasing grain. For the state, with an accurate monthly supply plan, the state grain authorities can organize grain transfer work in a planned manner, avoid roundabout transportation and opposite transportation, and save transportation costs, so as to accumulate construction funds for the state.

    Since the reasonable supply of rural grain-deficient households has been reliably guaranteed after the implementation of grain rationing, various grain-deficient households engaged in agricultural production should more actively participate in the agricultural cooperativization movement, work hard to increase production, and practice strict economy. Grain-deficient households that grow grain should work hard to cultivate the land and strive to produce more grain, and strive to become self-sufficient households or surplus grain households in the near future. Grain-deficient households that grow cash crops should work hard to increase the yield of cash crops according to the national plan, and sell more and better cotton, hemp, tea, sugar materials, oil crops, and other industrial raw materials and special products to the state to support the great cause of national socialist industrialization. This is the glorious task of the current rural grain-deficient households.

    做好粮食定销工作
    辛起
    国务院在八月二十五日发布的“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”，对农村粮食统销作了明确的规定。这就是，在统一安排农村粮食购销的原则下，根据一九五五年春耕前后分配到乡的粮食定产、定购、定销数字，结合实际情况，经过核定产量，规定用粮标准，按户计算用粮量，以产量减去用粮量和实缴公粮，一次划分余粮户、自足户、缺粮户。对生产粮食的缺粮户和不生产粮食的农村居民，把必须由国家供应的粮食数量，一次规定下来，由国家发给粮食供应证，然后“凭证、按月、定点、定量”进行供应。对缺粮户的粮食供应量，每年评定一次。有了这些规定，农村中一亿缺粮人口所需粮食的合理供应，将会得到更可靠的保证。
    两年来的经验证明，要作好农村粮食统销工作，必须把粮食统购同统销密切结合起来。这就是说，要一次划分余粮缺粮的界限，购销工作统一安排，对有余粮的，进行统购，对缺粮的，进行统销，并且在春耕以前把全年的统销数字核定下来。今年三、四月间某些地区农村粮食供应曾经一度紧张，其原因之一，就是粮食购销工作没有密切结合，缺粮的人怀疑国家是否保证供应粮食，因而情绪不安定；那些不缺粮甚至有余粮的人，也说“缺粮”，以致许多不该供应的人得到了供应，该少供应的人供应得多了，而有些真正缺粮的人却没有得到及时的供应。实行粮食定销以后，就可以避免这些缺点，国家对真正缺粮的农民保证合理供应。
    为什么对农村缺粮户的定销数字要一年一评呢？这是因为在党和人民政府奖励农业生产的政策指导下，在国家兴修水利、农业贷款等多方面的扶持下，随着农业合作化的发展，农民的粮食产量将会逐年提高，许多缺粮户将由粮食不足转而达到自给自足以至有余。一年之后，就会有若干生产粮食的缺粮户不需要国家供应，甚至有些缺粮户还可能出卖部分余粮。所以一年评定一次定销数字，是完全合理的。
    大家已经知道，国家今年确定的粮食统购计划数字比上两年都有减少，而且这个数字三年不变。这是进一步巩固工农联盟的一项重大措施。要把这个减少了的统购数字稳定下来，就必须严格控制粮食销量。如果粮食销量不严格控制，突破了国家的计划，结果必然增加向农民统购的数字。这样做，那就会使增产不增购、统购数字三年不变的政策受到破坏。显然，这种情况对国家和农民都是非常有害的。因此，除在市镇实行粮食定量供应，严格压缩不合理的销量以外，在农村也必须实行粮食定销。为了做好农村粮食定销，就须要进行深入的调查研究工作，并充分发动群众进行评议，以便正确地核定缺粮户的供应量，把一年需要供应给缺粮户的粮食数量核定下来，以保证国家销售计划不被突破，从而保证粮食统购统销政策的贯彻执行。
      为了划清余粮缺粮的界限，正确地核定对缺粮户的供应数量，就必须根据农民的生产情况和生活条件，合理地规定各类缺粮农户的用粮标准。首先，要规定出种子的用粮标准。在同一个地区的生产粮食的农民所用种子数量是相同的，因此，不论余粮户或缺粮户留用的种子数量，都应根据实际需要规定，以保证发展粮食生产的需要。其次，口粮、饲料的用粮标准，必须根据各种缺粮户不同的具体情况加以确定。一般粮产区的缺粮户，由于生活条件一般低于当地余粮户，他们的口粮和饲料用粮标准就自然低于当地余粮户。对于按照国家计划种植技术作物的缺粮户，办法中规定，他们的口粮、饲料用粮标准，“应不低于当地余粮户的用粮标准”，以便鼓励种植技术作物的农民积极生产工业原料，以保证国家工业生产的需要，这是合理的。灾区缺粮户口粮、饲料用粮标准，办法中规定“应低于当地正常年景缺粮户的用粮标准”。因为农民在遭受了灾害之后，实际生活条件必然不如正常年景时候的生活条件，因此，规定他们的口粮、饲料用粮标准低于正常年景下缺粮户的标准，也是符合灾区实际情况的。对农村的非农业人口口粮、饲料用粮标准，办法中规定“一般不应超过当地余粮户的用粮标准”。所谓农村的非农业人口，一般是农村里的手工业者、医生、小学教师、小商小贩等。这些人的劳动都是直接为农民服务的，同时他们之中的一部分人的生活条件也比较高些，因此对这些人口的口粮和饲料用粮标准适当地定得高一点，但是不使他们的用粮标准超过当地余粮户的标准，这也是正确的。
    缺粮户的定销数字确定以后，所有缺粮农民都应当用服从国家计划和节约粮食的精神来购买粮食。首先，缺粮户应该服从国家供应粮食品种的计划。办法中规定，“供应缺粮户的粮食品种，可以根据国家在当地有什么供应什么的原则进行供应，并可供应部分薯类。但国家粮食机关应尽力组织调剂，适当照顾群众需要。”这项规定既照顾了国家的可能，也照顾了缺粮人民的需要。大家应该认识，我国地区广大，南方和北方的粮食作物成熟季节和人民用粮习惯都不一样，国家虽然要尽最大可能来组织粮食品种的调剂，但还不可能在任何季节都能满足城乡消费者对粮食品种的需要。因此，缺粮户应该体谅国家的困难，自觉地改变某些生活习惯，国家供应什么粮食就吃什么粮食。
    按照农村粮食统购统销暂行办法的规定，国家对缺粮户的粮食供应，在时间上要作合理的安排。就是说，国家粮食机关今后将根据什么时候缺粮什么时候供应的原则，分别确定对缺粮户开始供应的时间，并作出分月供应的计划。这样做，是非常必要的。两年来的经验告诉我们，如果不定出分月供应计划，有些人可能在“先吃国家的，后吃自己的”思想支配下，在一个年度开始的头几个月，向国家大量购买粮食，使国家的农村粮食销量计划指标大量消耗，等到青黄不接，真正缺粮的时候，供应的粮食反而少了，以致形成紧张现象，过多地消耗国家的库存周转粮。根据缺粮户实际缺粮情况定出分月供应计划以后，一方面国家粮食机关要有计划地组织供应，保证满足缺粮户的合理需要；另方面缺粮户也要先吃自己的粮，后吃国家的粮，并多想办法节约粮食，以保证粮食分月供应计划不被突破。这样，农村粮食统销工作就有了稳定的秩序了。对缺粮农民来说，可以及时地得到供应，也不致为购买粮食而耽误时间。对国家来说，由于有了准确的分月供应计划，国家粮食机关就可以有计划地组织粮食调运工作，避免迂回运输、相向运输等浪费，以节约运输费用，为国家积累建设资金。
    既然实行粮食定销以后，农村缺粮户的合理供应都有了可靠的保证了，从事农业生产的各种缺粮户应该更积极地参加农业合作化运动，努力增加生产，厉行节约。种植粮食的缺粮户应该勤劳耕作，争取生产更多的粮食，争取在不久的将来由缺粮户变成自足户或余粮户。种植技术作物的缺粮户，应该按照国家计划努力增加技术作物的产量，把更多更好的棉花、麻、茶、糖料、油料等工业原料和特产品卖给国家，支援国家社会主义工业化的伟大事业。这就是当前农村缺粮户的光荣任务。
