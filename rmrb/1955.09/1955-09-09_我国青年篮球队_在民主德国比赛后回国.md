    我国青年篮球队
    在民主德国比赛后回国
    根据中德文化合作协定来德意志民主共和国访问的中国青年篮球队已经结束了它的访问比赛，在七日乘飞机返国。
    中国青年篮球队是在八月十七日到达德意志民主共和国的。篮球队曾经同哈雷和来比锡队、柏林市代表队和德国国家选手队正式比赛过四次，中国篮球队男子队和女子队四次都以绝对优势得胜。
    民主德国体育报纸和哈雷市的报纸都发表文章，赞扬中国青年篮球队的技术。哈雷专区统一社会党机关报“自由报”八月二十二日评论说：“卓越的球技、巨大的跳跃力以及投篮的准确，使我们中国的朋友们获得辉煌的胜利。”德国“体育回声报”九月五日以“熟练的篮球健将的表现”为题，盛赞中国球员的动作迅速灵敏。这家报纸说：“中国球员们精确地运用了各种球技和策略。要达到中国球队的水平，我们还需要努力学习。”
