To do a Good Job in Distributing Reading Materials for 120 Million Children and Adolescents
    Zuo Lin
    In the past few years, our bookstore's work in supplying reading materials has been very successful and has been praised by the people. The attitude of many staff members in diligently serving the people is very touching to readers. However, there are also many problems in the work of supplying reading materials, especially in the supply of reading materials for children and adolescents, where there are many shortcomings.
    Children across the country generally report that they cannot buy the reading materials they need in bookstores, and many good books are often out of stock. Even Shanghai, which has done a relatively good job in supplying children's reading materials, has this situation. Weimin Primary School in Shanghai wanted to buy ten kinds of books, but only managed to buy three. A student at Shanghai No. 2 Girls' Middle School registered for "The Platoon Advances in Formation" but only received it after more than a month. Award-winning works such as "The Story of Luo Wenyin" and "The Little Swallow's Flight of Ten Thousand Miles" are often unavailable in cities such as Beijing, Changsha, and Baoding. The situation is even worse in rural areas than in cities. Apart from county towns and large towns where books can still be bought in bookstores, rural children have nowhere to buy books. In Hebei Province, the average number of children's books sold in recent years has been one book for every 1,100 people. Rural high primary schools have few books, and even the schools with the most books have only a few hundred volumes. They reflect: buying a book is more difficult than anything else!
    The reason why the supply of reading materials for children and adolescents is not done well is inseparable from the business ideology and working methods of bookstore staff. First of all, some bookstore staff still have capitalist business ideology. They like to sell thick books, because these books are expensive, have large profits, are eye-catching, and are easy to manage, while children's reading materials are thin, cheap, have small profits, and are difficult to find. Selling ten copies is not as good as selling one thick book. Therefore, they do not carefully estimate market needs, are unwilling to order a large number of children's reading materials, and even when certain children's reading materials are out of stock in the market, they are unwilling to continue stocking them.
    Secondly, they underestimate the supply of reading materials for children and adolescents. For example, the Xinhua Bookstore General Store has never issued instructions on the distribution of reading materials for children and adolescents, but only issues a stock preparation notice before each "June 1st" Children's Day. Many bookstores even believe that they have no task to promote children's reading materials. Most bookstores do not have a "Children's Reading Materials" category at all, mixing children's reading materials with adult reading materials. Children enter the bookstore as if they have arrived in an ocean of books, making it difficult to find the books they want to buy. Some bookstore staff even dislike children coming to the store. In Tieling County, Liaoning, when children go to the bookstore to buy books and ask to see the content first, the bookstore staff say: bring the money first, and then I'll let you see!
    Distribution work is a major political task. All books are distributed to hundreds of millions of people through bookstores. Without this bridge, books cannot play their role. Whether this work is done well has a huge impact on the spiritual life of the people. If distribution staff only want to make more money, regardless of whether they are serving the needs of political culture or serving various readers well, then that is capitalist business ideology. In order to improve distribution work, especially the distribution of popular reading materials and reading materials for children and adolescents, relevant parties should strengthen socialist ideological education for all bookstore staff, so that they can establish a correct understanding of distribution work and actively serve various readers.
    At present, there are approximately 120 million children and adolescents aged six to fifteen, accounting for one-fifth of the country's population. Such a large number of readers should be given an important position. It should be understood that reading materials for children and adolescents are a powerful tool for carrying out communist education among children and adolescents. Supplying reading materials for children and adolescents is not a "small matter," but a major matter related to educating our new generation. Therefore, bookstore staff must attach importance to the work of distributing reading materials for children and adolescents. As the general hub for distributing reading materials for children and adolescents, the Xinhua Bookstore General Store should quickly establish an organization to manage the distribution of reading materials for children and adolescents, study methods for distributing reading materials for children and adolescents, and ensure that reading materials for children and adolescents can penetrate schools and rural areas.
    Distributing reading materials for children and adolescents is different from distributing reading materials for adults. It should be tailored to the special circumstances of children and adolescents, and special methods should be adopted to make children and adolescents aware of what books are available and to make it convenient for them to buy books. In order to allow children and adolescents to carefully select their favorite books, bookstores should display reading materials for children and adolescents in a concentrated manner, rather than placing them on the highest shelves or locking them in cabinets. They should also regularly post advertisements to tell children and adolescents about good books and what new books have been published. Bookstore staff should care for children and adolescents like older sisters and brothers, often taking the initiative to understand the needs of young readers, and answering the questions of young readers kindly and patiently. In order to prevent children and adolescents from dirtying or messing up the books, a designated area can be set aside to display sample books, exclusively for children and adolescents to browse. The procedures for buying books should also be particularly simple. In addition, I would also like to mention the issue of selling reading materials for children and adolescents in all comprehensive bookstores. Currently, many bookstores do not sell reading materials for children and adolescents, which is very inconvenient for young readers. For example, in Harbin, there is only one store that sells reading materials for children and adolescents. Children often have to travel ten miles to buy books, and if they take a bus, the fare is more expensive than the book itself. Children have a lot of complaints about this. In order to facilitate young readers, the book classification in comprehensive bookstores should include "Children's Reading Materials," and a large number of reading materials for children and adolescents should be sold. Private bookstores and book stalls should also be well utilized and subjected to socialist transformation, so that they can also serve young readers and various readers well. The Xinhua Bookstore's plan to gradually form a distribution network of public and private bookstores in cities is a good one, as it allows readers to buy books conveniently.
    Going deep into schools, going deep into rural areas, and facing children and adolescents are the keys to distributing a large number of reading materials for children and adolescents. Therefore, organizing the work of bringing books to schools and rural areas is extremely important. More than 70 percent of children and adolescents in our country with reading ability are in rural areas. If reading materials for children and adolescents cannot reach rural areas, it is impossible to distribute a large number of reading materials for children and adolescents. Currently, Xinhua Bookstore has approximately 5,000 mobile book supply personnel in rural areas. They climb mountains and cross ridges, working diligently and are very popular among farmers. However, for the vast rural areas of the country, this number is too small. Therefore, it is still necessary to take various measures and use all possible forces to distribute books to rural areas. For example, can we consider developing the previously effective professional distributors on a large scale (of course, we should strengthen their education to prevent them from making mistakes such as coercion and commandism)? Can we ask cooperative or Communist Youth League organizations to assist in selling books on a relatively large scale? In cities, can we establish a system where one bookstore is linked to several schools, or set up amateur distributors in schools with a large number of students, who are supplied with booklists by the bookstore and sell books on their behalf? In my opinion, some of these can be tried out, and some can be used boldly under strengthened leadership.
    The Communist Youth League organizations and education departments should actively assist bookstores in doing a good job in the distribution of reading materials for children and adolescents. Experience has shown that if bookstores, education departments, and Communist Youth League organizations can closely cooperate and jointly recommend reading materials for children and adolescents, the effect will be great. For example, in the first half of 1954 in Tianjin, because the Communist Youth League organizations, the Education Bureau, and the bookstore jointly made three recommendations to children and adolescents, more than 20,000 copies of the book "Han Meimei" were sold. Prior to this, the general sales volume for each type of book was only five or six hundred copies.
    Schools have a special responsibility in guiding children and adolescents in reading and recommending reading materials for children and adolescents. Krupskaya said it well: "Books can also greatly improve the quality of learning." If we compare the academic performance of children and adolescents who read often with the academic performance of children and adolescents who have not taken any books other than textbooks, we can see that there is a big difference in their knowledge. Therefore, principals, teachers, and counselors must regard guiding children and adolescents in reading as their responsibility, and should often recommend good books to children and adolescents and organize children and adolescents to buy books. School libraries, in particular, should buy more reading materials for children and adolescents, organize them to read, and help them answer questions, so that books become the closest friends of children and adolescents. Parents all love their children. Loving their children means not only giving them warmth in life, but also giving them spiritual food. Therefore, regularly buying books for children and caring about their reading is an important responsibility of parents.
    We believe that the comrades in the bookstore will overcome all difficulties and do an excellent job in supplying reading materials for children and adolescents, so that children and adolescents can continuously obtain rich spiritual food. Children and adolescents will also sincerely thank all the people who serve them.

### 做好一亿二千万少年儿童读物的发行工作

    做好一亿二千万少年儿童读物的发行工作
    左林
    几年来，我们书店读物的供应工作，很有成绩，得到了人民的称赞。其中许多工作人员勤勤恳恳为人民服务的态度，是很使读者感动的，但是，读物供应工作也存在不少问题，特别是少年儿童读物的供应工作，缺点很多。
    全国小朋友普遍反映，在书店里买不到他们需要的读物，许多好书常常脱销。连儿童读物供应工作做得比较好的上海市也有这种情形。上海市卫民小学要买十种书，结果只买到三种。上海市第二女子中学的一个学生，要买“中队齐步前进”，登记了一个多月才买到。得奖的作品“罗文应的故事”、“小燕子万里飞行记”等，在北京、长沙、保定等城市经常买不到。城市如此，农村更差。除了县城和大镇还可以在书店买到书以外，农村儿童就无处买书。河北省几年来所出售的儿童读物，平均一千一百多人才有一册。农村高小的图书很少，藏书最多的也不过数百册。他们反映：买本书，比什么都难！
    少年儿童读物供应工作做得不好的原因，是同书店工作人员经营思想和工作方法分不开的。首先是某些书店工作人员还有资本主义经营思想。他们喜欢销厚本书，认为这些书价钱大、利大、醒目、管理方便，而少年儿童读物则本薄、价低、利小、难找，销十本也抵不上销一本厚书。因而他们不去认真估计市场需要，不愿意大量定购少年儿童读物，甚至某些少年儿童读物在市场脱销时，也不愿继续进货。
    其次，他们轻视少年儿童读物的供应工作。例如：关于少年儿童读物的发行工作，新华书店总店从来没有发过指示，只是在每年“六一”前发一个备货通知。许多书店甚至认为自己没有推销少年儿童读物的任务。大多数书店根本没有“儿童读物”类，把少年儿童读物和成人读物混在一起。儿童进了书店，好像到了书的海洋，很难找到要买的书。有些书店工作人员甚至厌恶少年儿童上门。在辽宁铁岭县，少年儿童到书店买书要求先看看内容，书店工作人员就说：拿钱来，再给你看！
    发行工作是一个重大的政治任务。所有的书籍，都是通过书店发行到亿万人手中去的。没有这个桥梁，书就不能发挥它的作用。这个工作做得好不好，对人民的精神生活有着十分巨大的影响。如果发行工作人员只是想多卖钱，而不问是否服从了政治文化的需要，是否很好地为各种读者服务，那就是资本主义经营思想。为了改进发行工作，特别是通俗读物和少年儿童读物的发行工作，有关方面应当对所有书店工作人员，加强社会主义的思想教育，使他们树立起对发行工作的正确认识，积极地为各种读者服务。
    目前六岁到十五岁的少年儿童约近一亿二千万，占全国人口五分之一。对数量这样众多的读者，是应该给以一个重要位置的。要知道，少年儿童读物是对少年儿童进行共产主义教育的有力工具。供应少年儿童读物不但不是一件“小事”，而是
  一件有关教育我国新一代的大事。所以书店工作人员对发行少年儿童读物的工作必须重视。作为发行少年儿童读物总枢纽的新华书店总店，应当很快地建立管理少年儿童读物发行的机构，研究少年儿童读物的发行办法，务必使少年儿童读物能够深入学校，深入农村。
    发行少年儿童读物和发行成人读物不一样，它应该针对少年儿童的特殊情况，采取特殊的方法，使少年儿童知道出了什么书和方便地买到书。为了使少年儿童能仔细选择自己喜爱的书，书店应该把少年儿童读物集中地摆出来，而不要放在书架的最高层或锁在柜子里。还应该经常张贴广告，告诉少年儿童有什么好书，新出了一些什么书。书店服务员应该像大姐姐大哥哥一样关心少年儿童，经常主动地了解小读者的需要，亲切、耐心地解答小读者的问题。为了避免少年儿童把书弄脏或翻乱，可以划出一定地方陈列样书，专供少年儿童翻阅。买书的手续也应特别简便。此外，这里还要提一提在所有综合书店出售少年儿童读物的问题。现在许多书店是不卖少年儿童读物的，这对小读者很不方便。例如：在哈尔滨市，只有一个门市部出售少年儿童读物。少年儿童买书常常要跑十来里路，如果坐车，车钱比书钱还多。小朋友对此很有意见。为了便利小读者，综合书店的图书分类应该有“儿童读物类”，大量出售少年儿童读物。对私营书店和书摊也要很好地利用和进行社会主义改造，使他们也很好地为小读者和各种读者服务。新华书店在城市中准备逐渐将公营和私营书店组成发行网的办法是很好的，这可以使读者能够方便地买到书。
    深入学校，深入农村，面向少年儿童，这是大量发行少年儿童读物的关键。因此，组织书籍下学校、下乡的工作极为重要。我国具有阅读能力的少年儿童百分之七十以上在农村，如果少年儿童读物不能下乡，大量发行少年儿童读物是不可能的。现在，新华书店在农村的流动书籍供应人员约有五千人。他们爬山越岭，辛勤工作，很受农民的欢迎。但是对于全国广大农村来说，这数目太少了，因此，还需要采取各种办法，运用一切可以运用的力量，将书籍发行到农村去。比如：是否可以考虑大量发展过去行之有效的专业发行员呢（当然应加强对他们的教育，使他们不发生强迫命令的错误）？是否可以比较大量地请合作社或青年团的组织协助代售呢？在城市里，是否可以建立一个书店联系几个学校的制度，或者在人数较多的学校里设立业余的发行员，由书店供给书目，代售书籍呢？凡此种种，我认为有些可以试办，有些可以在加强领导的条件下放手使用。
    青年团组织和教育部门，应该积极协助书店做好少年儿童读物的发行工作。经验证明，如果书店、教育部门、青年团组织能够密切联系配合，共同推荐少年儿童读物，效果是很大的。如天津市在一九五四年上半年，由于青年团组织、教育局、书店联合向少年儿童作了三次推荐工作，“韩梅梅”一书就销了二万多册，在此以前，一般是每种书只销五六百册。
    在指导少年儿童阅读和推荐少年儿童读物方面，学校负有特殊的责任。克鲁普斯卡娅说得好：“书籍同样也能把学习质量提得很高。”如果我们把常常读书的少年儿童的学习成绩，跟除去课本以外没有拿过任何书籍的少年儿童的学习成绩比较一下，我们可以看出，他们在知识上有很大的区别。因此，校长、教师、辅导员必须把指导少年儿童阅读看作自己的责任，而且应当经常向少年儿童推荐好书，组织少年儿童买书。学校图书馆尤其应当多买少年儿童读物，组织他们阅读，帮助他们解答问题，使书籍成为少年儿童最亲密的朋友。家长都是热爱孩子的，热爱孩子不但要给他们生活上的温暖，而且也应该给他们精神上的食粮。因此，经常地为孩子买书、关心孩子的阅读，是家长的重要责任。
    我们相信，书店的工作同志，将打破一切困难，把少年儿童读物供应工作做得出色，使少年儿童源源不断地得到丰富的精神食粮。少年儿童也将衷心地感激一切为他们服务的人们。
