    I
    A large-scale, highly mechanized, new socialist-type mine – the Hegang Dongshan Vertical Shaft – has been built in Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province.

    This vertical shaft holds a large reserve of high-quality industrial coal. Based on its designed output, it can continue to be mined for decades.

    When people come to Hegang, they can see the two tall headframes standing halfway up Dongshan Mountain and piercing the sky from afar; walking into the industrial square, they can see the huge main and auxiliary shaft hoist rooms and the three-story administrative combined welfare building and other buildings. People can ride in the cage of the auxiliary shaft, like taking an elevator, and in fifty seconds they will arrive at the underground city that never sleeps, 150 meters deep underground – the bottom yard, illuminated by special explosion-proof electric lights as bright as day. Look! Battery locomotives pull long trains of mine cars back and forth, and car pushers continuously push the coal-filled cars forward. Walking around the bottom yard, you can see the pump room, the underground central substation, the waiting room, the traffic control room, the mine car cleaning chamber, the mud pump room, the sedimentation tank, the dressing station, and other underground facilities that are also highly mechanized and indispensable for mine production.

    II

    The coal mining and transportation process of this vertical shaft is completely mechanized. It greatly reduces the heavy physical labor of the miners and allows for production at a very high speed.

    The world's top-notch Donbas-type combined coal mining machine, capable of cutting coal, loading coal, and unloading coal, cuts the black and shiny coal from the coal wall, crushes the large pieces of coal, and then automatically loads the coal onto the chain conveyor laid on the working face. After passing through the belt conveyor on the level roadway, it is transferred to the heavy-duty chain conveyor going uphill, where the coal will be directly loaded into the iron mine cars parked at the loading station in the mining area.

    When a car is full of coal, the loader presses a button, and the shunting winch installed on the main transportation roadway will automatically start, pulling the loaded car forward and bringing another empty car over. When all the empty cars are full, the loader can immediately pick up the special telephone installed near his work location to request the transportation dispatcher in the underground transportation control room to quickly supply empty cars. In the blink of an eye, a train of empty cars pulled by a battery locomotive will appear in the not-too-distant front, rumbling along the main transportation roadway. The chain conveyor continuously pours coal into the newly delivered empty cars...

    Trains full of coal flow like water from all directions to the bottom yard composed of a circular transportation line. Here, the most intense scene appears. When the designed output is reached, seventy trains will continuously drive into the bottom yard every day, which means that an average of one train will drive into the bottom yard every eight minutes. Strangers may ask, with so many trains, how is traffic order maintained? Will there be collisions? This concern is unnecessary. Because the signals for directing traffic and moving the switches in the bottom yard are all electrified and automated. As long as the transportation dispatcher sits in the control room of the bottom yard and presses the corresponding button, he can send out a signal prohibiting passage or allowing passage, and at the same time, the switch will automatically move to the required position. In this way, the trains safely pass through the switches and continuously drive into the bottom of the main shaft.

    The heavy trains loaded with coal that have just been sent into the bottom yard do not stop moving. When the circular tippler operator at the bottom of the main shaft presses a button, the chain car pusher automatically crawls forward, sending the coal-filled trains into the circular tippler one by one. The car rotates in the circular tippler, the coal is poured into the inclined coal bin set at the bottom of the main shaft, and the empty car is automatically pushed to the empty car line. When the gate in the loading chamber is opened, the coal in the inclined coal bin immediately fills the six-ton skip. Then the skip hoists the coal to the ground along the main shaft at a speed of 5.3 meters per second.

    III

    This vertical shaft is equipped with a highly mechanized set of water-sand filling equipment with unprecedented capabilities in our country. It provides a strong guarantee for extracting more of the country's underground resources.

    Water-sand filling mining is the best mining method for filling the underground goaf completely with sand when mining thick coal seams. It can prevent spontaneous combustion in the goaf and prevent surface subsidence, making roof management easier. More importantly, this method can be used to recover more underground coal, minimizing the loss of the country's underground resources. In a word, it has the characteristics of high recovery rate and high safety.

    But sending huge amounts of sand underground is not an easy task. After the Dongshan Vertical Shaft reaches its designed output, the amount of sand sent underground every day is almost equal to the volume of coal mined every day. Therefore, this set of giant, highly mechanized filling equipment is very important. This set of equipment consists of a ground sand storage bin, a mixing station, a pressurization station, a main pipeline for transporting slurry, an underground sedimentation tank, a mud discharge pipeline, an underground water reservoir, a ground water storage pond, and a main pipeline for transporting water above and below ground.

    The large amount of sand transported every day is first sent to the giant ground sand storage bin, and then the sand stored in the sand bin is automatically loaded into the belt conveyor installed at the bottom of the sand bin by a reciprocating sand feeder, and transported by the belt to the slurry mixing station set on the ground.

    After the slurry is mixed, it is sent directly to the mining area through seamless steel pipes.

    After the slurry reaches the mining area, it settles in the goaf, while the water and the mud separated from the slurry flow along the drainage roadway into the underground sedimentation tank.

    Cleaning the sludge in the sedimentation tank is a most laborious and complex operation, which has always been done manually in some other coal mines in our country. The Dongshan Vertical Shaft is completely mechanized. The high-lift mud pump in the mud pump chamber of the sedimentation tank can continuously discharge the slurry that has settled in the mixed water tank and is concentrated by the scraper to the ground. The clear water in the sedimentation tank then flows along the water ditch of the main transportation roadway to the underground water reservoir, and the underground water is pumped to the ground water storage pond through a water pump.

    The underground water is settled in the ground water storage pond and then sent to the mixing station by the water pump set in the water storage pond.

    This is repeated endlessly to form a continuous flow of sand and water.

    IV

    This vertical shaft is extremely well-equipped with safety and welfare facilities, which fully embodies the Party and the state's policy of safe production in the coal mining industry.

    Powerful ventilation equipment and a complete ventilation system ensure that workers can breathe enough air underground, and also ensure that the toxic and harmful methane gas generated underground is converted into harmless gas and discharged outside the well. Once an accidental disaster occurs underground that requires changing the direction of the airflow, the driver can easily operate the specially set-up light winch in the mechanical room to immediately adjust the gate. The designers took into account the unique severe cold of northeastern North China in winter, and in order not to send excessively cold air underground, the main ventilator is also equipped with air heating equipment.

    The sprinkling pipeline network, which extends from the ground to the bottom of the shaft and from the bottom of the shaft to the loading stations, transfer points, coal cutting machines, and combined coal mining machine working locations in each mining area, subdued the coal dust floating in the air, which has explosive properties.

    Safety equipment to prevent the expansion of coal dust explosion accidents—rock dust shelves—can be seen at the exit and entrance of each mining area and each coal mining working face. Once a fire breaks out underground, the fire prevention train composed of ten cars pulled by a battery locomotive can immediately rush to the fire location to supply sufficient fire extinguishing equipment. Not only that, as long as people turn on the gate on the ground, the specially set-up fire-fighting water pipe will immediately connect with the compressed air pipeline extending to each work location, turning the compressed air pipe into a water supply pipe, and immediately transporting the water needed to extinguish the fire from the ground to the fire extinguishing location.

    Fire extinguishers, fire-fighting sand, fire-proof gates, and other essential equipment for fire extinguishing can be found everywhere in this underground.

    The combined welfare building also has changing rooms, shower rooms, sun lamp rooms, clinics, health food stations, and small shops specially set up for the miners.

    V

    This new socialist-type Dongshan Vertical Shaft has received Soviet economic and technical assistance from design and construction to equipment supply and production preparation.

    The geological conditions of the Dongshan Vertical Shaft are quite complicated, and the geological data was extremely insufficient during the design, so many new technical problems arose during the construction process. These problems could not be completely solved without thorough investigation, scientific calculation, and rich experience by experts. During the construction process, the Soviet expert group headed by Soviet expert Comrade Bogumolov provided specific technical guidance on site, which was one of the important guarantees for the successful construction of the Dongshan Vertical Shaft.

    The Soviet government has also trained a group of cadres and workers for the production management and technical management of the Dongshan Vertical Shaft. There are dozens of managers and engineering and technical personnel here who have studied in the Soviet Union for a year, including: mine director, chief engineer, section chief, section head, mechanic, squad leader, combined coal mining machine driver, etc. They have also interned at Soviet coal mine technical schools and mines.

    This vertical shaft has been built. In the future, our task is to work diligently, study hard, and comprehensively promote advanced Soviet experience to manage such a pair of modern mines well, and to complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned by the state.

    一座现代化的竖井
    鹤岗矿务局副局长兼东山竖井矿矿长　宋肖颂
    鹤岗矿务局东山竖井总工程师　于兴隆
    一
    在黑龙江省鹤岗市建成了一座规模巨大的、高度机械化的社会主义的新型矿井——鹤岗东山竖井。
    这座竖井底下蕴藏着大量的优质工业用煤。以它的设计产量计算，可以继续开采数十年。
    人们来到鹤岗，远远就可以看到竖立在东山半腰插入天空的两个高大的井架；走进工业广场，就可以看到巨大的主副井绞车房和三层建筑的行政联合福利大楼等建筑物。人们可以坐上副井的罐笼，像坐电梯一样，在五十秒钟以后就到了一百五十公尺深的地下的不夜之城——井底车场，它被特种防爆电灯照耀得和白昼一样。看吧！蓄电池机车牵引着长长的一列矿车来往急驰，推车机把装满煤的矿车不停地向前推去。环绕井底车场走上一周，就可以看到水泵房、井下中央变电所、候车室、行车调度室、矿车清理硐室、泥泵房、沉淀池、包扎所等等同样为高度机械化了的矿井生产上所不可缺少的地下设施。
    二
    这座竖井的采煤和运煤过程完全是机械化的。它大大地减轻了矿工们繁重的体力劳动，用很高的速度进行生产工作。
    世界上头等的能够割煤、装煤、卸煤的顿巴斯型联合采煤机，把乌黑发亮的煤炭从煤壁上切割下来，把大煤块打碎，然后自动地把煤装到铺在工作面上的链板运输机里去。经过平巷上的皮带运输机，再转装到上山的重型链板运输机里，煤从这里就将一直装入停放在采区装车站的铁制矿车里。
    当煤装满了一个车厢的时候，装车工人一按电钮，设在主要运输大巷上的调车绞车就会自动开动，把已经装满的重车拉向前方，把另一个空车带过来。当空车全部装满的时候，装车工人可以马上拿起设在他工作地点附近的用来调度运输的专用电话，向井下运输调度室里的运输调度员请求迅速供应空车。一转眼的工夫，在不远的前方就会出现一列由蓄电池机车牵引着的空车，沿着主要运输大巷隆隆地驶来。链板运输机不断地向新送来的空车倾下煤炭……
    装满煤炭的列车从四面八方像水一样地流向由环形运输线路构成的井底车场。在这里最紧张的场面就出现了。达到设计产量时，每天将有七十次列车源源地驶进井底车场里来，也就是说平均每八分钟就要有一列车驶进井底车场。陌生人会问车这么多、行车秩序怎样维持？列车会不会发生冲突？这个顾虑是不必要的。因为在井底车场指挥行车的信号和搬动道叉全部是电气化和自动化的。只要运输调度员坐在井底车场的调度室里一按相应的电钮就可以发出禁止通行或允许通过的信号，同时道叉子也会自动地移动到要求的位置上。这样列车就安全地通过道叉不停地驶入主井井底。
    刚刚被送进井底车场的装满煤的重列车并没有停止不动。当主井井底圆型翻笼司机一按电钮，链式推车机就自动向前爬行起来，把装满煤炭的列车一个个地送进圆型翻笼。车在圆型翻笼内转一周，煤就倾进设在主井井底的倾斜煤仓，空车皮就被自动推到空车线上去。装载硐室里的闸门一开，倾斜煤仓里的煤马上就灌满了容量六吨的箕斗。然后箕斗沿主井井筒以每秒五点三公尺的速度把煤炭提升到地面。
    三
    这座竖井装备了为我国前所未有的有巨大能力的高度机械化的一套水砂充填设备。它为更多地采出国家地下资源提供了有力的保证。
    水砂充填采煤就是把地下的采空区完全用砂子再填满，是开采厚煤层的最好的采煤方法。它既能防止采空区的自然发火，又能防止地表塌陷，使顶板管理更加容易。更重要的是，采用了这种方法可以更多地回采出地下的煤炭，把埋藏在地下的国家资源的损失减少到最低限度。一句话，它具有回采率高、安全性大的特点。
    可是把巨量的砂子送到井下却不是一件容易办到的事情。东山竖井达到设计产量后，每天要往井下送进的砂子，几乎同每天采出的煤炭的体积相等。因此，这一套巨型的、高度机械化的充填设备就显得十分重要了。这套设备是由地面储砂仓、搅拌站、加压站、输送砂浆干线管路、井下沉淀池、排泥管路、井下水仓、地面储水池、地面地下输水干线管路等所组成。
    每天运来的大量的砂子，首先被送进巨型的地面储砂仓，然后靠往复给砂机把储存在砂仓里的砂子自动地装进设在砂仓底部的皮带运输机，由皮带运送到设在地面上的砂浆搅拌站。
    砂浆搅拌好以后，经无缝钢管一直送到采区。
    砂浆到达采区以后，就沉降在采空了的地方，而水和从砂浆内析出的泥分，则沿着疏水巷道流进井下沉淀池。
    沉淀池内淤泥的清扫是一项最繁重而复杂的操作过程，在我国的另一些煤矿里一向以人力来进行。东山竖井则完全以机械来进行。沉淀池的泥泵洞室的高扬程泥泵，可以不间断地把沉淀在混水池内又被刮斗集中起来的泥浆排出到地面。沉淀池内的清水则沿着主要运输大巷的水沟流向井下水仓，通过水泵把井下水排到地面储水池。
    井下水在地面储水池内经过沉淀后再经过设在储水池中的水泵送到搅拌站。
    如此反复不已地构成一个不断的砂流和水流。
    四
    这座竖井在安全福利设备上是极其完备的，它充分体现了党和国家在煤矿工业上的安全生产的方针。
    强大的通风设备、完善的通风系统保证了工人在井下可以呼吸到足够的空气，也保证把井下产生的有毒有害瓦斯变成无害的气体排出井外。一旦井下发生意外的灾害需要改变风流的方向时，司机就可以毫不费力地在机械室内开动特设的轻便绞车，马上调整好闸门。设计者考虑到东北北部冬季特有的严寒，为了不使过冷的空气送入井下，主要扇风机还附设有空气加热的设备。
    从地面延伸到井底，从井底又延伸到各个采区装车站、转装地点、截煤机、联合采煤机工作地点的撒水管路网，把具有爆炸性能的浮游在空气中的煤尘制服住了。
    防止煤尘爆炸事故扩大的安全设备——岩粉棚，在每个采区、每个采煤工作面的出口和入口都可以看到。井下一旦发生火灾，由蓄电池机车牵引着的由十节车所组成的防火列车，就可以马上开赴发火地点，供应足够的灭火器材。不仅如此，人们只要在井上开动闸门，特设的消火水管马上就会同延伸到各个工作地点的压风管路连结起来，变压风管为输水管，立刻从地面把扑灭火灾所需要的水输送到灭火的地点。
    灭火器、消火砂、防火闸门等等在灭火上不可缺少的器材和设备，在这个井下到处都有。
    在联合福利大楼里还专门为矿工们设置着更衣室、淋浴室、太阳灯室、诊疗所、保健食品站、小卖店等福利设备。
    五
    这座新的社会主义类型的东山竖井，从设计、施工到设备供应，生产准备，都得到苏联在经济上技术上的帮助。
    东山竖井的地质情况是相当复杂的，而在设计时地质资料又极为不足，所以在施工过程中就产生了很多新的技术问题。这些问题，如没有专家周密的调查，科学的计算，丰富的经验是不可能彻底解决的。在施工过程中，以苏联专家鲍古莫洛夫同志为首的苏联专家工作组在现场进行具体的技术指导，是东山竖井建设成功的重要保证之一。
    苏联政府还为东山竖井的生产管理和技术管理培养了一批干部和工人。这里有几十名管理人员和工程技术人员，曾在苏联学习了一年，其中有：矿长、总工程师、科长、段长、机械师、班长、联合采煤机司机等。他们也曾在苏联的煤矿技术学校和矿井实习过。
    这个竖井是建成了。今后，我们的任务是要兢兢业业地工作，努力学习和全面推广苏联先进经验，来管理好这样一对现代化的矿井，完成和超额完成国家所给予的任务。
