Worker Athletes from All Production Fronts Across the Country
Feng Zhong

The first National Workers' Games is about to officially open on October 2nd. The preliminary rounds for basketball, volleyball, and soccer have concluded, and the finals for the winning teams from the preliminary rounds have been held for thirty-four matches. Athletes participating in track and field, cycling, and weightlifting are also intensifying their training, preparing to achieve even better results at the Games.

The over 1,700 athletes participating in the Games are outstanding athletes selected step by step from grassroots sports events involving over one million employees from seventeen units nationwide, including railways, coal mines, the First Ministry of Machinery, the Second Ministry of Machinery, heavy industry, textiles, postal and telecommunications, electricity, highway transportation, seamen, construction, store employees, education, light industry, agriculture and water conservancy, forestry, and the People's Bank of China. These athletes come from all production fronts across the motherland. There are forestry workers from Hainan Island, heavy industry workers from remote Xinjiang and Yunnan; there are workers from the Yellow River harnessing project, the Huai River harnessing project, and various basic construction sites, as well as highway transportation workers from the Kangzang Plateau; there are Yangtze River shipping sailors, as well as state farm tractor drivers; there are female textile workers, as well as miners from the mines; there are veteran workers with more than ten years of work experience, and there are also seventeen-year-old female workers. Today, they gather in the capital of the motherland, representing workers across the country to report to the people of the motherland on the achievements of sports training over the past six years.

Among these athletes, many are not only athletic champions on the sports field but also model workers and production experts. Wang Chonglun, a nationally renowned labor model, is an athlete selected from the heavy industry system to participate in the 200-meter low hurdles and 400-meter intermediate hurdles at the Games. He won first place in the 200-meter low hurdles at the Anshan city-wide sports event. Wang Chonglun also regularly plays basketball, swims, and learned to skate last year. It is precisely because he regularly participates in sports activities that his health has transformed from weak to very healthy. He maintains abundant energy, enabling him to delve into tool improvement day and night, creating outstanding achievements in production.

Li Fengqin, a young female foundry worker from the Dalian Shipyard representing the First Machinery Trade Union in the cycling competition at the Games, is a "three-good" model worker. She created the "core-holding iron" fixture, which increased production efficiency sixfold, earning her the title of Second-Class Labor Model of Lüda City and First-Class Labor Model of Dalian Shipyard. She is also a model in amateur cultural learning. Her achievements in sports are also outstanding. In June of this year, at the Liaoning Provincial Cross-Country and Cycling Competition, she participated in the women's 3,000-meter cycling race, achieving a time of six minutes and fourteen seconds and three tenths of a second, breaking the national record.

Among the athletes from light industry, store employees, agriculture and water conservancy, electricity, construction, seamen, postal and telecommunications, coal mines, textiles, and the People's Bank of China, there are also labor models and advanced workers.

Among the athletes, there are also some leading staff members such as factory directors, mine managers, and trade union chairmen from factories, mines, enterprises, and construction sites. They not only take the lead in participating in exercises themselves but also attach great importance to carrying out employee sports activities in their units. Therefore, sports activities in their units are generally well-developed. Zhang Qingwu, the director of the Fushun Warm Steam Plant, is one such example. He is the captain of the National Coal Mine Soccer Team participating in this Games. Because Zhang Qingwu regularly participates in sports exercises, he is very healthy, and has never had his work or studies affected by poor health in recent years. Sports activities at the Fushun Warm Steam Plant are very active. More than 80% of the factory's employees regularly participate in calisthenics. In addition to having already established basketball and volleyball teams, the factory organized a soccer team in 1953, with nearly thirty soccer players, four of whom were selected for the Fushun mining area representative team. The athletes have healthy physiques, and their attendance rate is almost 100%, enabling them to complete their work tasks very well.

Among the athletes participating in the Games, there are also athletes from ethnic minorities. Bagmalov, a nineteen-year-old Russian athlete from Xinjiang Nonferrous Metals Company, won first place in the hand grenade throwing event at the first National Heavy Industry Employees' Sports Games, with a score of 62.45 meters. The Minzu people living in Yunnan number less than 500,000, but athletes have also been selected to participate in the sports event. In addition, there are Mongolian, Hui, and Korean athletes. Sports activities among the Korean ethnic group are very widespread. The Korean people especially love soccer. Among the soccer teams of the units participating in the Games, most units have Korean soccer players. The National Forestry Soccer Team is almost entirely composed of Korean athletes from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin.

Among the 1,700 athletes, there are more than 600 female athletes, accounting for more than one-third. Today, they not only shoulder the task of building the motherland in production like men but also have the conditions to actively participate in sports activities and exercise to better produce and work like men. Wang Xuehua, an athlete from the light industry representative team and a female worker from the Lüda Knitting Factory, was originally a girl from a poor family who suffered from poverty and hunger in the old society, making her body weak. After liberation, she went to work in the factory, and after work every day, her back and legs ached. She didn't want to eat, couldn't sleep well, and often missed work due to illness, failing to complete production tasks and study well. Since 1953, she has persisted in various sports exercises regardless of winter or summer, and as a result, she has become very strong from being sickly. Since April of last year, she has participated in various sports events in Lüda city multiple times, continuously winning first or second place in the 400-meter, 800-meter, long jump, and cycling races. At this Games, she will participate in the 800-meter and long jump competitions. After Wang Xuehua became healthy, her production efficiency increased by one time compared to before, and the quality also improved from 85% to 100%, and she was rated as an advanced worker in the entire factory. Moreover, she also has abundant energy to participate in cultural learning, no longer feeling tired during classes, and her test scores are very good every time. She has now transitioned from being illiterate to studying in the first year of junior high school. Xu Nengying, a female athlete from the agriculture and water conservancy representative team, is a model female driller at the Meishan Reservoir and is only nineteen years old this year. Before liberation, her family was poor, and she was a child bride at the age of twelve, washing clothes and cooking all day long, and had no idea what sports were. When she was sixteen years old, she heard that the Foziling construction site was recruiting drillers, so she asked a few companions to walk to Foziling to become drillers. Drilling work is very hard and requires a strong body. She actively participated in sports activities, playing ball, running, and persisting in exercising. On May 1st of this year, she participated in the first sports event for Huai River harnessing employees, winning first place in the women's 800-meter and 400-meter races, and second place in the 200-meter race. In June, she participated in the first Anhui Provincial Workers' Sports Games, winning first place in the 800-meter race and second place in the 400-meter race. At the first National Agriculture and Water Conservancy Workers' Sports Selection Event, she won second place in the 800-meter race.

Among the female athletes, there are also many who are already mothers of one or several children, but they are still able to arrange their production, study, and housework time well, persist in sports exercises, and are as active on the sports field as young girls.

Although the development of employee sports has only been a few years, many worker athletes with excellent results have emerged. Among the athletes participating in this Games, some have broken or approached the national record in some sports events, and their scores are improving rapidly.

Zhang Xiling, an athlete from the heavy industry representative team, broke the national record for the 10,000-meter race at the Lüda City Autumn Track and Field Sports Meeting in October of last year with a score of thirty-one minutes and fifty-seven seconds and nine tenths of a second, becoming the holder of this national record. His 5,000-meter time is fifteen minutes and twenty-one seconds, which is also tied with the national record. Zhang Xiling has been participating in sports exercises since 1949, running more than 10,000 meters from home to work every day. In 1953, he represented the Northeast region in the National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Sports Meeting, winning third place in the 10,000-meter race and second place in the 5,000-meter race. After returning from Beijing, he organized a long-distance running training group of seven people and persisted in training. Last August, at the National Track and Field Gymnastics Sports Meeting for Students Above Middle School in Thirteen Cities, he watched the 10,000-meter long-distance running performance of Soviet track and field team member Popov, and re-ordered his training plan, finally creating excellent results not long after. Liu Chengbang, a 23-year-old athlete from the railway representative team, is the national record holder for hand grenade throwing, with a score of 68.90 meters. His javelin throwing score is also very good. In August 1954, at the Track and Field Gymnastics Sports Meeting for Students Above Middle School in Thirteen Cities held in Lüda City, he broke the national javelin record, which had been held for eighteen years in our country, with a score of 55 meters and 23.5 centimeters (the current national javelin record is 61 meters and 11 centimeters, which was created by Yu Jin'an of the Central Sports Institute this year). In addition, the current score of 1 minute and 57.1 seconds for the men's 800-meter race of Li Zhonglin, an athlete from the railway representative team, has also broken the national record.

In cycling events, the achievements of worker athletes are the most prominent. The cycling race scores of Li Guizhi, a female athlete from the heavy industry representative team, are: 2 minutes and 50 seconds for 1,500 meters, 5 minutes and 55.7 seconds for 3,000 meters, and 10 minutes and 19 seconds for 5,000 meters. These scores have all broken the national record. Among the female cyclists, Li Fengqin from the First Machinery representative team, Shen Bingqing from the railway representative team, and Wang Lingmei and Xuan Ping from the Mars representative team also have excellent scores. In particular, Xuan Ping, a 19-year-old female athlete, shortened her 3,000-meter cycling time from 7 minutes and 36 seconds to 6 minutes and 40.2 seconds during her recent month-long intensive study, and recently shortened it to 5 minutes and 59.3 seconds in a recent test. Among male cyclists, Yu Guihai from the electricity representative team also broke the national record for the 10,000-meter cycling race at the recently held China Electricity Employees' Sports Games, with a score of 17 minutes and 20 seconds (the national record is 17 minutes and 29.7 seconds). Sun Guomin, an athlete from the Mars representative team, won the 10,000-meter cycling championship at the first National Sports Games of the China Mars Sports Association with a score of 19 minutes and 21.4 seconds. After recent intensive training, his 10,000-meter score has improved rapidly to 17 minutes and 17 seconds, also breaking the national record.

This National Workers' Sports Games is the first major review of worker sports since the establishment of New China. We warmly hope that worker athletes will create excellent results at the Games, and we also hope that the athletes will return to their production posts and lead more employees in their units to participate in sports exercises, as the backbone of developing mass employee sports activities.

    来自全国各个生产战线的工人运动员们

    全国第一届工人体育运动大会就要在十月二日正式开幕了。大会的篮球、排球、足球的预赛已经结束，预赛中的优胜队的决赛也已进行了三十四场；参加田径、自行车、举重比赛的运动员也正加紧练习，准备在大会上取得更好的成绩。
    参加大会的一千七百多名选手是全国铁路、煤矿、第一机械、第二机械、重工业、纺织、邮电、电业、公路运输、海员、建筑、店员、教育、轻工业、农业水利、林业、中国人民银行等十七个单位，从有一百多万名职工参加的基层单位运动会中一步步选拔出来的优秀运动员。这些运动员来自祖国四面八方的各个生产战线。有从海南岛来的林业工人，有从遥远的新疆和云南来的重工业工人；有来自根治黄河工地、治淮工地和各个基本建设工地的工人，也有来自康藏高原的公路运输工人；有长江航运的轮船驾驶员，也有国营农场的拖拉机手；有纺织厂的女工，也有矿井下的矿工；有十几年工龄以上的老工人，也有十七岁的女工。他们今天齐集祖国的首都，代表全国职工向祖国人民汇报六年来体育锻炼的成绩。
    在这些选手中，有许多人不仅是运动场上的健将，而且是劳动模范和生产上的能手。全国著名的劳动模范王崇伦是重工业系统选拔出来的参加大会二百公尺低栏和四百公尺中栏比赛的运动员。他的二百公尺低栏在鞍山全市的运动大会上曾获得第一。王崇伦还经常打篮球，会游泳，去年又学会了滑冰。正是因为他经常参加体育活动，身体由衰弱变得很健康。一直保持充沛的精力，因此能够夜以继日地钻研，改进工具，在生产上创造突出的成绩。
    代表第一机械工会参加大会自行车比赛的大连造船公司青年翻砂女工李凤琴，是“三好”模范，她创造了“握芯铁”胎具，使生产效率提高了六倍，得到了旅大市二等劳动模范和大连造船公司一等劳动模范的称号。她还是业余文化学习的模范。在体育运动上的成绩也是突出的。今年六月在辽宁省越野、自行车比赛大会上，她参加女子三千公尺自行车比赛，成绩是六分十四秒三，打破了全国最高纪录。
    在轻工业、店员、农业水利、电业、建筑、海员、邮电、煤矿、纺织、中国人民银行等单位的运动员中，也都有劳动模范和先进工作者。
    在运动员中还有一些是厂矿、企业、工地的厂长、工会主席等领导工作人员。他们不仅自己带头参加锻炼，而且非常重视开展本单位的职工体育运动，因此他们所在单位的体育活动一般的开展得较好。抚顺暖汽厂厂长张庆武就是其中的一个。他是参加这次大会的全国煤矿足球代表队的队长。张庆武由于经常参加体育锻炼，身体很健康，几年来从没有因为身体不好影响工作和学习。抚顺暖汽厂的体育活动非常活跃。全厂百分之八十以上的职工都经常参加广播体操。厂里除早已建立了篮球和排球队外，一九五三年又组织了足球队，有近三十名足球队员，其中四名被选为抚顺矿区的代表队。运动员们都有健康的体格，出勤率几乎都是百分之百，能够很好地完成自己的工作任务。
    参加大会的运动员中还有少数民族的选手。来自新疆有色金属公司的十九岁的俄罗斯族运动员巴格马洛夫，在全国第一届重工业职工体育大会上获得手榴弹掷远第一名，成绩是六十二点四五公尺。居住在云南的民家族不到五十万人，但也有运动员被选拔出来参加体育大会。此外还有蒙古族、回族和朝鲜族的运动员。朝鲜族的体育活动开展得非常广泛。朝鲜族人民尤其喜爱足球。在参加大会的各单位的足球队中，多数单位都有朝鲜族的足球队员。全国林业的足球队几乎全体是由吉林延边朝鲜族自治区的朝鲜族运动员组成的。
    在一千七百多名运动员中，女运动员有六百多人，占三分之一以上。今天，她们不仅在生产上同男子一样担负着建设祖国的任务，而且也同男子一样有条件积极参加体育活动，锻炼身体，以便能够更好地生产和工作。轻工业代表队的运动员、旅大针织厂的女工王学花，原是一个贫苦家庭出身的姑娘，在旧社会受贫困、饥饿的折磨，身体瘦弱。解放以后到工厂做工，每天下了班腰也酸，腿也痛，不愿吃饭，也睡不好觉，还经常因病缺勤，完不成生产任务，学习得也不好。她从一九五三年起无论冬夏一直坚持各种体育锻炼，结果由多病变得非常健壮了。从去年四月起，她多次参加旅大市的各种运动会，连续得到四百公尺、八百公尺、跳远和自行车比赛的第一名或第二名。在这次大会上她将参加八百公尺和跳远比赛。王学花身体健康起来以后，生产效率比以前提高一倍，质量也由百分之八十五提高到百分之百，被评为全厂的先进工作者。而且也有充沛的精力参加文化学习，上课不再感觉疲倦了，每次考试成绩都很好，现在已由文盲转入初中一年级学习。农业水利代表队的女运动员徐能英是梅山水库的模范女钻探工，今年只有十九岁。解放前家里贫穷，十二岁就给人做童养媳，整天洗衣、做饭，根本不知道什么是体育运动。十六岁那年她听说佛子岭工地招收钻探工，就约几个同伴步行到佛子岭当了钻探工人。钻探工作很艰苦，需要有强壮的身体。她就积极参加体育活动，打球、跑步、坚持锻炼。今年五月一日她参加治淮职工首届体育运动大会，曾获得女子八百公尺和四百公尺的第一名，二百公尺的第二名。六月又参加了安徽省第一届工人体育运动大会，又获得八百公尺的第一名和四百公尺的第二名。在全国第一届农业水利工人体育选拔大会上，获得八百公尺的第二名。
    在女运动员中还有不少人已经是一个或几个孩子的妈妈，但她们仍然能够很好地安排生产、学习和处理家务的时间，坚持体育锻炼，和年轻的姑娘们一样活跃在运动场上。
    开展职工体育运动虽然只有几年的历史，但已经涌现了不少的成绩优越的工人运动员。参加这次大会的运动员中，有些人在一些运动项目中的成绩已经打破了全国最高纪录或接近了全国最高纪录，而且成绩正在飞跃地提高。
    重工业代表队运动员张希苓，在去年十月旅大市秋季田径运动会上，以三十一分五十七秒九的成绩打破了全国一万公尺的最高纪录，成为这一项全国最高纪录的保持者。他的五千公尺成绩是十五分二十一秒，也平全国最高纪录。张希苓从一九四九年起参加体育锻炼，每天从家里跑一万多公尺到工厂上班。一九五三年他代表东北区参加全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会，获得一万公尺的第三名和五千公尺的第二名。从北京回去后，他就组织了七个人的长跑锻炼小组，坚持锻炼。去年八月在全国十三个城市中等以上学校学生田径体操运动大会上，他看了苏联田径代表队队员波波夫的万公尺长跑表演，又重新订了锻炼计划，不久终于创造了优越成绩。铁路代表队的运动员二十三岁的刘成邦是手榴弹掷远全国最高纪录的保持者，成绩是六十八公尺九十公分。他的投标枪成绩也很好，一九五四年八月在旅大市举行的十三个城市中等以上学校学生田径体操运动大会上，他以五十五公尺二十三点五公分的成绩打破了我国保持十八年之久的标枪最高纪录（现在标枪全国最高成绩是六十一公尺十一公分，是中央体育学院于金安今年创造的）。此外，铁路代表队运动员李中林男子八百公尺现在的成绩是一分五十七秒一，也打破了全国最高纪录。
    在自行车比赛项目中，工人运动员的成绩是最为突出的。重工业代表队的女运动员李桂芝自行车比赛的成绩：一千五百公尺是二分五十秒，三千公尺是五分五十五秒七，五千公尺是十分十九秒。这些成绩都已打破了全国最高纪录。在女子自行车运动员中，第一机械代表队的李凤琴，铁路代表队的沈冰清和火星代表队的王苓妹和玄萍，也都有优良的成绩，特别是十九岁的女运动员玄萍在最近集中学习一个多月中，自行车三千公尺的成绩由七分三十六秒缩短到六分四十秒二，最近测验又缩短到五分五十九秒三。男子自行车运动员中，电业代表队的于贵海在最近举行的中国电业职工体育运动大会上也打破了自行车一万公尺的全国最高纪录，成绩是十七分二十秒（全国最高纪录是十七分二十九秒七）。火星代表队的运动员孙国民在中国火星体育协会全国第一届体育运动大会中获得自行车万公尺冠军，成绩是十九分二十一秒四，经过最近的加紧锻炼，万公尺的成绩已飞跃地提高到十七分十七秒，也突破了全国最高纪录。
    这次全国工人体育运动大会是新中国建立以来工人体育运动的第一次大检阅。我们热烈希望工人运动员们在大会上创造优良的成绩，更希望运动员们在回到生产岗位以后，带动本单位更多的职工参加体育锻炼，作为开展职工群众性的体育活动的骨干。
