The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1955, issue 35, has been published.

This issue features an editorial titled "Consolidate Peace in the Far East and the World," commemorating the tenth anniversary of the victory over Japanese militarism. The editorial points out that the historic victory over the aggressive forces of militarist Japan was achieved ten years ago thanks to the joint efforts of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and their allied countries. After the war, the attitudes of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China towards Japan clearly demonstrated their peaceful foreign policies, and they have done much to promote the normalization of relations with Japan. However, the occupation system has undermined Japan's economic and cultural life, preventing the Japanese people from developing their various talents. Japanese democratic patriots are currently engaged in a resolute struggle, demanding the abolition of the occupation system, ensuring the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, and independent Japan, and establishing economic and cultural relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and other countries.

This issue contains important articles such as "The Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam" by Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; "For Peace, for the Benefit of the People of Poland and Yugoslavia" by Rapacki, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; and "The Youth League - The Chinese Communist Party's Closest Assistant" by Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

Rapacki's article points out that the normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp is warmly welcomed by the Polish people. The Polish working class and all working people recognize that the new relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are of great significance for easing international tensions. We believe that the declaration of the Soviet and Yugoslav governments is in line with the vital interests and heartfelt wishes of the Polish people. We hope that the principles on which this declaration is based will also become the basis for cooperation and rapprochement between Poland and Yugoslavia.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五五年第三十五期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第三十五期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“巩固远东和全世界的和平”为题发表社论，纪念战胜日本军国主义十周年。社论指出，十年前，由于苏联、中国及其同盟国家的人民的共同努力，才取得了击败军国主义日本侵略势力的历史性胜利。战后，苏联和中华人民共和国对待日本的态度清楚地表现了它们的和平外交政策，它们在促使对日关系的正常化方面已做了很多的工作。但是，占领制度破坏了日本的经济和文化生活，使日本人民的各种才能不能发挥出来。日本的民主爱国人士目前正在进行坚决斗争，要求废除占领制度，保证建立一个和平、民主、独立的日本，并同苏联和中华人民共和国以及其他国家建立经济和文化关系。
    这一期刊载的重要文章有越南民主共和国主席胡志明的“越南民主共和国成立十周年”，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局候补委员拉帕茨基的“为了和平，为了波兰和南斯拉夫两国人民的利益”和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦的“青年团——中国共产党最亲密的助手”等。
    拉帕茨基的文章指出，南斯拉夫同苏联以及社会主义阵营其他国家间关系的正常化受到波兰人民的热烈欢迎。波兰工人阶级和全体劳动人民都认识到南斯拉夫同苏联和人民民主国家间的新关系对于缓和国际紧张局势具有重大的意义。我们认为苏南两国政府宣言符合波兰人民的切身利益和衷心愿望。我们希望，作为这个宣言的基础的各项原则也成为波兰和南斯拉夫合作和接近的基础。
