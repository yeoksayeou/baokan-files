    Let the Younger Generation Emit More Light and Heat
    The National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism is scheduled to open in Beijing today. This is a joyous event for the youth of the whole country, and also a major event of deep concern to the people of the whole country.
    Our country has 120 million young people, who have grown up under the close care of the Chinese Communist Party. They are lively and vigorous on all fronts of the motherland and have made many contributions to the motherland. They are the future and hope of the motherland. Obviously, to accomplish such a magnificent cause of socialist construction, it is necessary to fully mobilize them all and give full play to their strength and wisdom. This congress is to serve this task. At this congress, representatives of young activists from all over the country will report on their work to the motherland, exchange work experiences, unite the youth of the whole country, and call on them to dedicate their youth to the great socialist cause.
    For the sake of advancing the cause of socialism, the responsibility of the youth is enormous. The youth on the industrial front must launch a large-scale movement to increase production and practice economy. In terms of increasing production, more youth shock brigades should be organized to break through production quotas, promote labor competitions in the entire work area, and strive to generally improve labor productivity. In terms of saving, efforts should be made to collect waste materials, save raw materials, and fight against all waste and corruption. The youth on the agricultural front should strive to consolidate and develop agricultural producers' cooperatives, welcome the high tide of the new socialist mass movement in the countryside, learn and improve agricultural farming techniques, and actively increase agricultural production. The youth on other fronts should also give full play to their high degree of enthusiasm in their respective posts, and use creative labor to improve production efficiency and work quality.
    In all these aspects, the young activists have already set a glorious example for the youth of the whole country. The youth must learn from their noble qualities, and the young activists themselves must continue to work hard and maintain their glorious position on the industrial, agricultural, and other fronts.
    What exactly has created the glory of the young activists?
    The glory of the young activists is primarily due to their love of the motherland and their firm adherence to the battle post assigned to them by the motherland. Many young people have achieved outstanding results on the socialist construction front because they have completely dedicated their beautiful youth to their work. The work that the motherland needs us to do is all beautiful and has a promising future. Although we can choose different occupations according to the needs of the country and our own expertise, this does not mean that there is any hierarchy of high or low, noble or base, between these occupations. Naturally, not every occupation will attract people at once. Only persevering and arduous labor will enable people to discover the "secrets" in labor, generate a strong feeling for work, and thus be willing to contribute their lives to it. For example, some people look down on the occupation of pig raising, but Hua Yinfeng, a young pig breeder in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, has worked diligently and painstakingly studied this work, thereby creating a set of scientific pig raising methods and creating and saving a large amount of wealth for the country. Hua Yinfeng said well: "No matter what work, as long as you do it well and achieve results, it is a contribution to the motherland, and it is the greatest achievement." The idea of ​​dividing occupations into good or bad, high or low, and various levels is a reflection of the world view of the exploiting class. The exploiting class likes to seek personal fame and gain, so they like work that is famous and profitable, and are unwilling to do work that is anonymous and unprofitable; the exploiting class likes ease and hates labor, so they regard physical labor as "inferior" work. The youth should oppose this exploiting class ideology.
    The glory of the young activists is also due to their spirit of not fearing difficulties and overcoming difficulties. There will inevitably be many difficulties in socialist construction. Our country is an economically backward country. In a fairly long period, the supply of food and cloth cannot be sufficient, the houses are not spacious enough, and there are more difficulties in the supply of materials in areas with inconvenient transportation. In short, our life is still relatively difficult. But this is only compared with the beautiful life in the future, not with the past era. Compared with the past, the current living standards of the people have been greatly improved. Everyone remembers how many people suffered from hunger and cold and how many people were displaced during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. This situation certainly does not exist now. Remote areas were originally more difficult than big cities. Now we are going there to build, precisely to start changing the difficult situation there. Only with a correct understanding of difficulties can we overcome material difficulties with a revolutionary optimistic spirit. When more than 1,700 young people who participated in reclamation in Suileng County, Heilongjiang, first arrived in the uncultivated land, they slept in the open because they had no houses to live in; they ate millet mixed with salt because they had no vegetables to eat. They did not complain or shrink from such a life, just because they had such a correct understanding. In addition to material difficulties, there are also work difficulties. It is inevitable for anyone to encounter some failures and setbacks in their work. For young people, due to lack of experience, these failures and setbacks may be more and feel more difficult to endure. But remember: all these are difficulties in the process of advancement. As long as you are sufficiently mentally prepared for failures and setbacks, and believe that "failure is the mother of success," you will not be overwhelmed by difficulties, you will not be intimidated by difficulties, but you will be determined to overcome difficulties. A strong fighting will is tempered in the struggle against difficulties. The youth should strive to work for the motherland in the most difficult environment and to train themselves. Whoever wants to covet comfort, is unwilling to endure wind and waves, and escapes struggle, do not expect to achieve victory. Victory does not belong to those who seek ease and comfort.
    Young socialist construction activists must be active in learning. Socialist and communist societies can only be built on a high level of science and technology; if young people do not study science and technology, do not advance towards science, and do not seize the fortress of science and technology, they cannot engage in the great socialist construction cause. Having a high degree of enthusiasm for work is of course valuable, but enthusiasm alone cannot solve complex technical problems in production, and cannot build a socialist society. The Party and the state have already taken and are taking various methods to train scientific and technical talents, but it is impossible to send all young people to schools to study. Therefore, many young people mainly conduct spare-time study, study at work, learn from old workers, learn from experienced masses, learn from technicians, and learn from Soviet experts. Many of the representatives attending the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism this time have learned science and technology through their own hard work. For example, Wang Hengcheng from Benxi Coal Mine was originally an ordinary coal loader. Because he actively studied his business at work, he is now a seventh-level coal miner and has achieved five years without accidents; Sun Shigui, a young charter team from Ang'angxi, seriously studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and diligently learned from others, and created a "fast fire method" that can save a lot of coal; Hu Zhaokun from Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Weixian County, Shandong, seriously studied agricultural science and technology at work, enabling the cooperative he led to achieve bumper harvests year after year.
    In addition to studying science and technology, young people must also study politics, study Marxism-Leninism, study the Party's various guidelines and policies, and arm themselves with communist ideology. With a high degree of communist consciousness, they can increase their determination to overcome various difficulties in socialist construction, truly learn science and technology well, have a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, stand firm, and actively participate in the sharp class struggle during the transition period. The idea that "with technology, you have everything" is harmful. If you do not study politics, you will fall behind, you will become a short-sighted mediocre person, you will be corrupted by bourgeois ideology, you will be deceived or poisoned by hidden enemies, and you will ruin your own political life. There are many such lessons, and everyone must be vigilant.
    Young activists need to be good at uniting the masses. Unity is strength, and unity can overcome all difficulties. Giving play to collectivism is a good way to increase and consolidate unity among comrades; while individualism will destroy unity among comrades. Individualists despise collective power, highlight individuals, and exaggerate the role of individuals. Individualism is bound to fail. But opposing individualism does not mean negating the role of advanced individuals. The advancement of individuals can promote the progress of the collective. The advanced role of young activists is valued for this reason. However, the advancement of individuals cannot play a role without the support of the collective and cannot achieve any success. The fact that a large number of young activists can be produced so widely in New China illustrates this point. Therefore, young activists must be modest and prudent, and must strive to unite all young people, and use advanced methods to promote backward methods to carry out creative labor. Here, let us revisit what Comrade Mao Zedong said to the labor heroes and model workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1945: "You have many advantages and great contributions, but you must remember that you must not be proud. You are respected by everyone, which is appropriate, but it is also easy to cause pride. If you become proud, are not modest, no longer work hard, do not respect others, do not respect cadres, and do not respect the masses, you will not be able to become heroes and models. There have been some such people in the past, and I hope you will not learn from them." Young activists should firmly remember this passage.
    Let the younger generation emit more light and heat for the noble cause of socialism!

### 让年轻一代发出更多的光和热

    让年轻一代发出更多的光和热
    全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会定于今天在北京开幕。这是全国青年欢欣鼓舞的一件大事，也是全国人民深切关怀的一件大事。
    我国有一亿二千万青年，他们是在中国共产党的亲切关怀下成长起来的，他们生龙活虎似地活跃在祖国的各个战线上，为祖国立下了许多功劳。他们是祖国的未来和希望。显然，要完成社会主义建设这样宏伟的事业，就一定要把他们全部动员起来，把他们的力量和智慧充分发挥出来。这次大会就是为这个任务服务的。在这个大会上，各地青年积极分子代表要向祖国汇报自己的工作，交流工作经验，要团结全国的青年，号召他们为伟大的社会主义事业献出自己的青春。
    为着推进社会主义事业，青年的责任是巨大的。工业战线上的青年们要展开大规模的增产节约运动。在增产方面，要组织更多的青年突击队，突破生产定额，推动全工区的劳动竞赛，争取普遍地提高劳动生产率。在节约方面，要大力收集废材料、节省原材料，并向一切浪费和贪污行为作斗争。农业战线上的青年们要努力巩固和发展农业生产合作社，迎接在农村中新的社会主义群众运动的高潮，学习和改进农业耕作技术，积极地提高农业生产。其他战线上的青年们，同样要在自己的岗位上发挥高度的积极性，用创造性的劳动来提高生产效率和工作质量。
    在所有这些方面，青年积极分子们已经给全国青年树立了光荣的榜样。青年们要向他们的高贵品质学习，而青年积极分子们自己，要继续努力，在工业、农业和其他战线上保持他们的光荣的地位。
    究竟是什么东西造成了青年积极分子们的光荣呢？
    青年积极分子们的光荣首先是由于他们热爱祖国，坚守祖国分配给自己的战斗岗位。许多青年在社会主义建设战线上得到了优异的成绩，因为他们把美丽的青春完全献给了自己的工作。祖国需要我们做的工作都是美丽的，都有远大的前途。我们虽然可以根据国家的需要和自己的专长来挑选不同的职业，但这不是说在这些职业之间有什么高低贵贱的等级区别。自然，并不是任何一种职业一下子就会吸引住人的，只有坚毅的艰苦的劳动才会使人发现劳动中的“秘密”，对工作产生强烈的感情，从而愿意把自己的一生贡献给它。比方说，某些人是看不上养猪这样一个职业的，但浙江省东阳县青年饲养员华银凤却在这一工作中辛勤劳动，刻苦钻研，从而创造了一套科学的饲猪办法，为国家创造和节约了大量财富。华银凤说得好：“不管什么工作，只要好好去做，做出成绩来，就是对祖国的贡献，就是最大的出息。”把职业分成好坏高低、分成各种等级的思想是剥削阶级世界观的反映。剥削阶级好图个人名利，因此喜欢有名有利的工作，不愿做无名无利的工作；剥削阶级好逸恶劳，因此，把体力劳动都当作“下贱”的工作。青年们是应该反对这种剥削阶级思想的。
    青年积极分子们的光荣还由于他们不怕困难、战胜困难的精神。在社会主义建设中必然有许多困难。我国是一个经济落后的国家，在一个相当长的时期内，粮食、布匹的供应不能充分，房子住得不够宽敞，交通不便的地区物质供应方面的困难更多。总之，我们的生活还是比较艰苦的。但这只是同将来的美好的生活比，而不是同过去的时代比。如果同过去比，现在的人民生活水平是大大地改善了。谁都记得，在国民党反动派统治时期，有多少人忍饥挨饿，有多少人流离失所。这种情况现在当然不存在了。边远的地区比大城市原来就比较困苦，现在我们到那里去建设，正是为了着手改变那里的困苦状况。只有对困难有了正确的认识，才能用革命的乐观精神去战胜物质困难。在黑龙江绥棱县参加开垦的一千七百多名青年刚到未开垦地时，没有房子住，就露宿；没有菜吃，就吃小米拌盐花，他们对这样的生活毫不抱怨，毫不退缩，就因为有了这样正确的认识。除了物质上的困难，还有工作上的困难。任何人在工作中遇到一些失败和挫折都是难免的，对于青年人，由于缺乏经验，这些失败和挫折可能更多些，更觉得难于忍受些。但是要记住：这一切都是前进中的困难。只要对失败和挫折有了足够的思想准备，并且相信“失败是成功之母”，就不会在困难面前仓皇失措，就不会被困难吓倒，而会下定决心去战胜困难。坚强的斗争意志是在同困难斗争中锻炼出来的，青年们就应该争取到最困难的环境中去为祖国工作，去锻炼自己。谁想贪图安逸，不愿经受风浪，逃避斗争，谁就休想得到胜利。胜利是不属于苟且偷安的人的。
    青年社会主义建设积极分子必然是学习上的积极分子。社会主义和共产主义社会只能建立在高度科学技术基础上；如果青年们不去学习科学技术，不向科学进军，不夺取科学技术的堡垒，就不能从事伟大的社会主义的建设事业。有高度的工作热情，当然是可贵的，但是光凭热情是不能解决生产上复杂的技术问题的，是不能建成社会主义社会的。党和国家已经采取并且正在采取各种方法来培养科学技术人材，但是不可能把全部青年送到学校中去学习。因此许多青年主要是进行业余学习，在工作中学习，向老工人学习，向有经验的群众学习，向技术人员学习，向苏联专家学习。这次出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的代表中有许多人就是靠自己刻苦钻研学到科学技术的。例如本溪煤矿王恒成，原来是一个普通装煤工人，由于在工作中积极钻研业务，现在成为七级采煤工人，做到了五年不出事故；昂昂溪青年包车组孙士贵认真学习苏联先进经验，认真向别人学习，就创造了能够节约大量煤炭的“快速焚火法”；山东潍县红星农业合作社胡兆坤，在工作中认真学习了农业科学技术，使他所领导的社连年获得丰收。
    除了学习科学技术，青年还必须学习政治，学习马克思列宁主义，学习党的各项方针政策，用共产主义思想来武装自己。具有高度的共产主义觉悟，才能增长克服社会主义建设中各种困难的决心，才能真正学好科学技术，才能有高度的革命警惕性，站稳立场，积极参加过渡时期尖锐的阶级斗争。那种认为“有了技术就有了一切”的思想是有害的。不学习政治，就要落后，就要变成鼠目寸光的庸人，就要被资产阶级思想腐蚀，就要被暗藏的敌人所欺骗或毒害，以至断送自己的政治生命。这样的教训是很多的，大家一定要警惕。
    青年积极分子需要善于团结群众。团结就是力量，团结就能战胜一切困难。发挥集体主义是增长和巩固同志间的团结的好办法；而个人主义却要破坏同志间的团结。个人主义者轻视集体力量，个人突出，夸大个人的作用。个人主义是一定要失败的。但反对个人主义并不是抹杀先进的个人的作用，个人先进能够推动集体前进。青年积极分子的先进作用所以被重视，就是这个原因。但是个人的先进，没有集体的支持是不能发生作用的，是不能得到任何成就的。大批青年积极分子只能在新中国如此广泛地产生的事实就说明了这一点。因此，青年积极分子一定要谦虚谨慎，一定要努力团结全体青年，采用先进推动落后的方法来进行创造性的劳动。在这里，让我们重温毛泽东同志一九四五年对陕甘宁边区劳动英雄和模范工作者说过的话：“你们有许多的长处，有很大的功劳，但是你们切记不可以骄傲。你们被大家尊敬，是应当的，但是也容易因此引起骄傲。如果你们骄傲起来，不虚心，不再努力，不尊重人家，不尊重干部，不尊重群众，你们就会当不成英雄和模范了。过去已有一些这样的人，希望你们不要学他们。”青年积极分子应该牢牢记住这段话。
    让年轻的一代为社会主义的崇高事业发出更多的光和热吧！
