Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 23rd: Seoul dispatch: The United States and South Korea held their first formal meeting in Seoul on the 22nd to discuss detailed plans for U.S. military aid to South Korea.

According to General Rendle, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, who attended the meeting, the meeting discussed ways to implement the 1955-56 military aid plan. He said that the negotiations had made "great progress." According to sources, the content of the talks included: the U.S. equipping the ten South Korean reserve divisions established since the beginning of this year, and other issues.

Earlier that day, South Korean "Minister of National Defense" Son Won-il, who attended the meeting, said at a press conference that the U.S. military aid to South Korea this year will be $405 million. He also said that according to the U.S. military aid plan, the U.S. will deliver fifty Sabre jet fighters to South Korea within this year.

The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are not only violating the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcements of war materials into South Korea, but are also stepping up their opposition to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for supervising the implementation of this agreement. Son Won-il publicly stated on the 20th that now is the time to "take strong measures and actions" to deal with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    美国同李承晚举行扩军会谈
    新华社平壤二十三日电　汉城消息：美国和南朝鲜二十二日在汉城举行了第一次正式会议，讨论美国对南朝鲜的军事援助的详细计划。
    据参加会议的远东美军总司令兰尼兹尔在会后说，会议讨论了关于执行一九五五—五六年军事援助计划的办法。他说，谈判取得了“很大的进展”。据消息透露，会谈的内容包括：美国装备今年以来建立的十个南朝鲜后备师等问题。
    当天早些时候，参加会议的南朝鲜“国防部长官”孙元一在记者招待会上说，美国本年度对南朝鲜的军事援助将为四亿零五百万美元。他并且说，根据美国的军事援助计划，美国将在今年年内交给南朝鲜五十架佩刀式喷气战斗机。
    美国和李承晚集团不仅仅是违反停战协定把增援作战物资运入南朝鲜，而且正在加紧反对负责监督这个协定的执行的中立国监察委员会。孙元一在二十日公开发表声明说，现在是“采取强烈的措施和行动”来对付中立国监察委员会的时候了。
