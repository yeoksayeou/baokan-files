Liaoning Province Begins Surveying Wasteland to Prepare for Autumn Reclamation

The Liaoning Provincial People's Committee has transferred more than 40 agricultural and water conservancy cadres and surveying and design technicians to form ten wasteland surveying teams. On August 31, they began to go to ten counties, including Heishan, Tieling, Yingkou, Zhangwu, Fuxin, Faku, Xinmin, Liaozhong, Kangping, and Gaiping, to conduct wasteland surveys in order to determine the utilization methods of the wasteland in each county and prepare for autumn reclamation.

Within Liaoning Province, along the banks of the Liao River and Taizi River basins, in the western plains, and along the coast, there are many large areas of arable wasteland that have not yet been developed and utilized. According to preliminary surveys and estimates in sixteen counties and cities including Liaozhong, Kangping, Gaiping, and Yingkou alone, there are more than forty large pieces of wasteland that can be reclaimed, covering an area of about 100,000 hectares. Most of this wasteland has flat terrain and fertile soil, making it suitable for crop growth and of great utilization value. About 60,000 hectares of wasteland can be developed into paddy fields after small-scale water conservancy projects are built. Generally, after the wasteland is developed, early-maturing crops such as corn, sorghum, wheat, and potatoes can also be planted. The wasteland distributed in these areas is relatively large, generally about 200 to 300 hectares per piece, with larger pieces reaching 4,000 to 5,000 hectares, making it suitable for reclamation with new farm tools. Many pieces of wasteland can be developed in the autumn after simple surveying and planning. According to preliminary estimates, after these wastelands are reclaimed, each hectare can produce at least 3,000 to 4,000 jin of grain, and 100,000 hectares of wasteland can increase grain production by 300 million to 400 million jin per year.

    辽宁省开始勘测荒地准备今秋垦荒
    辽宁省人民委员会抽调农业、水利干部和勘测设计等技术人员四十多人，组成十个荒地勘测组，在八月三十一日开始分赴黑山、铁岭、营口、彰武、阜新、法库、新民、辽中、康平、盖平等十个县进行荒地勘测工作，以便确定各县荒地的利用办法，并给今秋开荒做好准备。
    辽宁省境内，沿辽河、太子河流域两岸，西部平原地区和沿海一带，有许多大面积的可耕荒地尚未开发利用；仅据辽中、康平、盖平、营口等十六个县市初步调查估计，可以开垦的大片荒地共四十多处，面积约达十万垧左右。这些荒地，大部地势平坦，土质肥沃，适于农作物生长，利用价值较大；其中约有六万垧荒地经过兴修小型水利工程后，即可开发为水田。一般的荒地开发后，也可播种玉米、高粱、小麦、土豆等早熟作物。分布在这些地区的荒地，每片面积都较大，一般约二、三百垧，较大的达四、五千垧，适于用新农具开垦。许多荒地经过简单勘测规划，即可在秋季进行开发。据初步估算，这些荒地开垦后，每垧地最少可生产粮食三千斤到四千斤，十万垧荒地每年即可增产粮食三亿斤到四亿斤。
