Strive to Fulfill This Year's Basic Construction Plan

There are only three months left in 1955. Seizing these three months to fully complete the basic construction plan for 1955 is the serious task currently facing all staff and workers in the basic construction sector.

The completion of the basic construction plan in the first few months of this year was not good. By the end of July, only 38.8 percent of the year's workload had been completed. Even with the estimated completion for August, the total will still be less than 50 percent. This means that in the last four months of this year, more than half of the annual plan must be completed to ensure the full realization of the 1955 basic construction plan. The success of this year's basic construction plan will not only affect the work of various aspects of the national economy this year, but also has extremely important implications for the realization of the basic construction tasks of the First Five-Year Plan. This is because the basic construction workload for the next two years accounts for more than half of the entire five-year basic construction workload, and the basic construction tasks for next year are expected to exceed this year's plan by more than 25 percent. If this year's plan cannot be fully completed, it will increase the burden for next year and the year after, thereby adding difficulties to the completion of the Five-Year Plan.

The poor completion of the plan in the first few months of this year was, objectively, due to the two revisions of the plan in accordance with the spirit of strict economy and the failure to deliver some design documents on time; subjectively, it was due to poor coordination and cooperation between some construction units and construction teams, between general contracting units and subcontracting units, and some leading agencies not grasping the plan tightly enough or delving deeply enough into the work. Now the annual construction plans of all units have been adjusted, and the design, equipment, and materials have mostly arrived, so the construction conditions are much better than in the previous months. In the coming months, as long as we strive to overcome the shortcomings in our work and actively take effective measures to strive to complete more work, it is entirely possible to do so. Last year, the staff and workers in the basic construction sector completed more than 40 percent of the annual plan in the four months from September to December, and in the year before that, more than 45 percent of the plan was completed in the last four months. This certainly reflects the very poor balance in the completion of the basic construction plan; but it also shows that if we become tense, work hard, and overcome difficulties, there is ample possibility of striving to complete the annual plan in the next three months.

In order to fully utilize these favorable conditions and strive to complete the annual plan in the last few months of this year, all basic construction departments must quickly and completely determine the specific plans for these months. Due to the achievements of comprehensive economy, the state has added some engineering projects with the money saved this year; at the same time, in order to reduce the burden for next year, some projects originally scheduled to be constructed next year will also be started ahead of schedule this year. However, some competent departments have not yet confirmed the specific projects to be added and started ahead of schedule. This state of procrastination must be changed immediately. There are still many projects to be completed in the last few months of this year. In order to ensure that these projects are completed on schedule, all construction units must cooperate with construction teams and other relevant units to immediately delve deeply into the construction conditions and tap potential, and then determine the specific completion date of each project. Based on this requirement, determine when the construction unit, design unit, technical supply department, general contracting unit, and various subcontracting units must complete what work, and compile a comprehensive construction plan and technical supply plan. In this way, the state's plan can become the clear responsibility of each unit.

Timely proposing specific plans is only one side of the problem. In order to guarantee the full realization of the plan, it is also necessary to organize the forces of all parties to struggle for the implementation of the plan. The key issue here is that the leading personnel at all levels of the basic construction department must establish a leadership style of going deep into the grassroots and have a sense of the overall situation.

At present, there are still many leading personnel of construction enterprises who sit in offices and direct production through functional institutions with many levels and a large number. They concentrate a large number of talented people who understand technology around themselves, letting them bear the tedious tasks of compiling and filling out reports, etc., without paying attention to equipping the foreman-level cadres, who are directly responsible for production, construction progress, quality, and cost, more strongly, resulting in the grassroots organizations for production being abnormally weak. Even more serious is that these foremen, who already feel unable to cope, do not receive specific help from their superiors, and are often hampered by the various reports sent down by their superiors and the various meetings convened. In order to change this situation, on the one hand, we must take training methods to fundamentally improve the technical level and organizational ability of foremen; on the other hand, and most importantly and most effective, is to change the leadership style of basic construction institutions at all levels. Leading personnel must go to the site to discover the reasons hindering the realization of the plan, tap the potential for accelerating the progress of the project, and specifically help grassroots cadres solve problems and overcome difficulties. At the same time, technical personnel should be placed in grassroots units as much as possible so that they can directly play a role in production. Only in this way can the organizational leadership and technical leadership of construction be truly strengthened, and the goal of striving to complete half of the annual plan in the last four months of this year will not become empty talk.

Another responsibility of the leading personnel at all levels of the basic construction department is to strengthen the overall concept and unconditionally guarantee mutual cooperation. In the first half of this year, the lack of cooperation between units was an important factor in the failure to complete the plan. Now, there is not much time left. In order not to waste the precious time in the last few months, we must vigorously overcome the shortcomings of lack of coordination and ensure that construction is carried out continuously according to the planned schedule. Local party committees, party organizations in basic construction departments, supervisory departments, and even the masses of workers must play a supervisory role and launch a struggle against the tendency of departmentalism. If something happens due to departmentalism that results in the failure to complete the cooperation task and thus affects the progress of the project, the relevant personnel should be given the necessary disciplinary action.

Mobilizing all staff and workers to launch a labor competition and strive to improve labor productivity and struggle to complete the plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it is one of the important keys to ensuring the completion of the plan. At present, there is a wide gap between the level of general workers and the level of advanced workers in terms of labor productivity. Wang Shou'an's plastering team of the Third Engineering Office of the Northeast Second Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering in Shenyang prepared materials and tools the day before to ensure that they started work as soon as they went to work the next day, exceeding the 1955 labor quota by 40 percent in the floor plastering project. However, the labor efficiency of plasterers in Liaoning Province as a whole generally only reaches 60 to 80 percent of the 1954 quota (this year's quota for plasterers has been increased by 31 percent compared to last year). Similar situations exist in other types of work and in other regions. If we launch a labor competition well, actively summarize and promote the experience of advanced producers, and raise the backward to the advanced level, we can greatly improve labor efficiency and accelerate the progress of the project. The Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of all construction enterprises must immediately strengthen their leadership over the labor competition and promote the mass competition upsurge.

The last few months of this year will be the most intense months. However, while grasping the progress of the project, we must prevent the bias of single-mindedness and resolutely ensure the comprehensive completion of the plan. Some construction enterprises have carried out economic activity analysis; some construction enterprises have promoted the experience of combining team accounting with labor competition, and the plans have been completed relatively well in these units. However, there are still many units that have not paid attention to the issue of comprehensive completion of the plan. Some units only pay attention to completing the investment amount, only choosing to do the projects that make more money first, and do not guarantee the completion of the project quantity plan according to the project items; some construction enterprises believe that implementing the policy of economy is only the business of the design unit, and have not yet carried out the economy work well; some units are carrying out economy one-sidedly, causing new backlogs and waste; and some units only care about rushing work and neglect safety, resulting in many casualties. In particular, the situation of neglecting quality is even more serious. According to incomplete statistics from nineteen key projects under the First Ministry of Machine Building, as many as 1,200 quality accidents requiring rework and repair occurred in the second quarter of this year alone. In the Second Quarter of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system, there were 2,964 quality accidents, and the number of reworks was even more than in the same period last year. From January to May, the Ministry of Construction Engineering had 1,799 quality accidents, and the rework losses totaled more than 145,000 yuan. Because many projects have to be reworked and redone after they are completed, two projects could have been completed, but now only one can be completed. This not only causes waste in manpower and materials, but especially causes great losses in time. In the tense construction ahead, we must be very vigilant against these biases and correct and prevent them.

It is a difficult task to complete more than 50 percent of the annual plan in four months. However, as long as we make full use of various favorable conditions and strive to overcome shortcomings in our work, we will certainly be able to overcome difficulties and achieve victory. We believe that all staff and workers on the basic construction front will certainly live up to the expectations of the Party and the people and victoriously complete the 1955 basic construction plan.

### 努力完成今年的基本建设计划

    努力完成今年的基本建设计划
    一九五五年只剩了三个多月。抓紧这三个多月的时间，全面完成一九五五年的基本建设计划，是基本建设部门全体职工当前的严重任务。
    今年前几个月基本建设计划完成的情况是不好的。到七月份为止，只完成了全年工作量的百分之三十八点八，加上八月份预计完成的工作量，总共也还达不到百分之五十。这就是说，在今年最后的四个月里，必须完成全年计划的一半以上，才能保证全部实现一九五五年的基本建设计划。而今年的基本建设计划完成得好坏，不仅会影响本年度国民经济各个环节的工作，而且对实现第一个五年计划的基本建设任务有极其重要的关系。因为今后两年的基本建设工作量占整个五年的基本建设工作量的一半以上，明年的基本建设任务预计要超过今年计划的百分之二十五以上。如果今年的计划不能全部完成，就要加重明年和后年的负担，从而给五年计划的完成增加困难。
    今年前几个月的计划完成得不好，从客观上说，是由于根据厉行节约的精神两次改动了计划和部分设计文件没有按时交付；从主观上说，是由于部分建设单位和施工单位之间、总包单位和分包单位之间配合协作不好，以及有些领导机关对计划抓得不紧、工作不深入。现在各单位的年度建设计划已经经过调整，设计、设备和材料也已大部到达，施工的条件要比以前几个月好得多。在今后几个月内，只要我们努力克服工作中的缺点，积极地采取有效措施，争取完成更多的工作量，是完全可能的。去年基本建设部门的职工曾在九月到十二月的四个月中完成了全年计划的百分之四十以上，前年的计划也有百分之四十五以上是在最后四个月中完成的。这固然反映了完成基本建设计划的均衡性很差；但同时也说明了如果紧张起来，努力奋斗，克服困难，在今后的三个多月中争取完成全年的计划，可能性是充分存在的。
    为了充分利用这些有利的条件，争取在今年最后这几个月中完成全年的计划，各个基本建设部门必须迅速地把这几个月的具体计划完全确定下来。由于全面节约的成就，今年国家用节约下来的钱增加了一些工程项目；同时，为了减轻明年的负担，有一些原定在明年施工的工程也将提前在今年施工。但是，有些主管部门直至现在还没有把要增加的和要提前开工的具体项目肯定下来。这种拖延不决的状况必须立即改变。今年最后几个月中还有很多工程要交工，为了保证这些工程按期完成，各个建设单位必须协同施工单位和其他有关单位，立即深入摸清施工条件、挖掘潜力，据以确定每一项工程的具体交工日期，然后按照这个要求，确定建设单位、设计单位、技术供应部门、施工的总包单位和各个分包单位必须在什么时候完成什么工作，编制出周密的综合施工计划和技术供应计划。这样，国家的计划才能变成各个单位的明确的责任。
    及时地提出具体的计划，只是解决了问题的一面。为了保证计划的全部实现，还必须组织各方面的力量为执行计划而奋斗。这里的关键问题，又在于基本建设部门的各级领导人员必须树立深入下层的领导作风和整体观念。
    目前仍有不少建筑企业的领导人员坐在办公室里，通过层次很多数量很大的职能机构来指挥生产。他们把有才能的懂得技术的人才大量地集中在自己周围，让他们担负编制和填写表报等繁琐的事务工作，而不注意将直接指挥生产，对施工的进度、质量、成本直接负责的工长一级干部配备得更强一些，结果就使得进行生产的基层组织异常薄弱。更严重的是，这些本已感到难以胜任的工长们，从上级得不到具体的帮助，还常常被上级发下来的各种表报和召集的各种会议绊住了手脚。为了改变这种状况，一方面要采取培养训练的办法，从根本上提高工长的技术水平和组织能力；另一方面，也是最重要的和最能迅速奏效的，就是改变各级基本建设机构的领导作风。领导人员要到现场上去，发现阻碍计划实现的原因，挖掘加速工程进度的潜力，具体帮助基层干部解决问题，克服困难。同时，要把技术人员尽可能地放到基层单位去，让他们直接在生产上发挥作用。只有这样，施工的组织领导和技术领导才能真正地加强，争取在今年最后的四个月中完成全年计划的一半，才不致变成空话。
    基本建设部门各级领导人员的另一个责任是必须加强整体观念，无条件地保证互相配合协作。今年上半年，各个单位配合协作不够好，曾是计划不能完成的一个重要因素。现在，剩下的时间不多了，为了不浪费最后几个月的宝贵时间，就必须大力克服互不协调的缺点，保证按照预定计划毫不间断地进行施工。地方党委、基本建设部门中的党组织、监察部门以至职工群众，要发挥监督作用，向本位主义的倾向展开斗争。如果发生了由于本位主义，没有完成配合协作任务因而影响了工程进度的事情，应该给有关的人员以必要的纪律处分。
    发动全体职工展开劳动竞赛，努力提高劳动生产率，为争取提前和超额完成计划而斗争，这是保证完成计划的重要关键之一。目前在劳动生产率方面，一般工人的水平和先进工人的水平相差很远。在沈阳的建筑工程部东北第二工程公司第三工程处的王寿安抹灰小组，头一天把材料和工具准备好，保证第二天一上班就干活，在抹地坪的工程上超过了一九五五年劳动定额百分之四十。而辽宁省全省抹灰工的劳动效率，一般只达到一九五四年定额的百分之六十到八十（今年抹灰工的定额比去年提高了百分之三十一）。其他工种和其他地区也有类似的情形。如果我们很好地发动劳动竞赛，积极地总结和推广先进生产者的经验，把落后的提高到先进的水平，就可以大大提高劳动效率、加速工程进度。各个建筑企业的党、行政、工会和青年团组织，必须立即加强对劳动竞赛的领导，把群众的竞赛高潮推动起来。
    今年最后的几个月将是最紧张的几个月。但是在抓紧工程进度的同时，必须防止单打一的偏向，必须坚决保证全面地完成计划。今年有些建筑企业开展了经济活动分析的工作；有些建筑企业推行了班组核算与劳动竞赛相结合的经验，在这些单位中，计划都完成得比较好。但是还有不少单位，仍然没有注意全面完成计划的问题。有些单位只注意完成投资额，只拣钱多的工程先做，而不按照工程项目保证完成工程量计划；有的建筑企业认为贯彻节约方针只是设计单位的事，至今还没有很好地展开节约工作；有的单位片面地进行节约，造成了新的积压和浪费；还有的单位只顾赶工忽视了安全，发生了不少伤亡事故。特别是忽视质量的情况更为严重。据第一机械工业部所属十九个重点工程的不完全统计，仅今年第二季度中要返工补修的质量事故就发生了一千二百件。重工业部系统第二季度发生了质量事故二千九百六十四件，返工次数比去年同期还要多。建筑工程部一至五月发生了质量事故一千七百九十九件，返工损失共达十四万五千多元。由于许多工程做完了又要返工重做，本来可以完成两项工程，现在只能完成一项，这不仅在人力、物力上造成浪费，特别是时间要遭受很大损失。在今后紧张的施工中间，对这些偏向必须十分警惕，加以纠正和防止。
    在四个月中要完成全年计划的百分之五十以上，这是一个困难的任务。但是，只要充分利用各种有利条件，努力克服工作缺点，就一定能战胜困难，取得胜利。我们相信，基本建设战线上的全体职工一定能够不负党和人民的期望，胜利地完成一九五五年的基本建设计划。
