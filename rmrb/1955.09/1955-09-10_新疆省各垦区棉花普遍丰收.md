    Cotton Harvests Are Generally Good in Various Reclamation Areas of Xinjiang Province
    The 150,000 mu of cotton planted by the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has begun to be harvested. The cotton picking work in the Yanqi and Aksu reclamation areas of southern Xinjiang began on August 25. The cotton picking work in the Manas River reclamation area of northern Xinjiang began in some areas in early September and will be generally harvested after September 10. This year, the cotton cultivated by the troops has generally achieved high yields due to the conscientious implementation of the technical guidance of Soviet experts. According to preliminary assessments, the average yield per mu of more than 82,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River reclamation area can exceed 400 jin, which is twice as high as the average yield of more than 30,000 mu of cotton in the area last year. It is estimated that the minimum yield per mu of more than 2,000 mu of long-staple cotton in Aksu and Turpan in southern Xinjiang can be 300 jin.
    In order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest, the leading authorities issued instructions to subordinate troops in mid-August, requiring all cotton planting units to "collect cleanly, collect well, collect quickly, and not lose a single cotton boll." All units began various preparations for cotton picking and drying as early as July and August. The Manas River reclamation area and the Urumqi reclamation area troops also opened cotton picker training classes. This year, 28 cotton pickers will participate in the cotton picking work.

    新疆省各垦区棉花普遍丰收
    新疆军区生产建设兵团种植的十五万亩棉花已开始收摘。南疆焉耆、阿克苏垦区的收花工作，八月二十五日即开始了，北疆玛纳斯河垦区的收花工作，九月初在部分地区开始，九月十日以后，将普遍收摘。今年部队栽培的棉花，由于认真贯彻了苏联专家的技术指导，普遍获得丰产。根据初步鉴定，玛纳斯河垦区八万二千多亩棉花，每亩平均产量可超过四百斤，要比去年该区三万多亩棉花的平均产量高一倍，南疆阿克苏、吐鲁番的二千多亩长绒棉，估计最低每亩可收三百斤。
    为了争取棉花丰产丰收，领导机关已在八月中旬向所属部队发出指示，要求所有植棉单位，做到“收净，收好，收快，不丢一朵棉絮”。各单位早在七、八月间即开始了收花、晒花等各项准备工作，玛纳斯河垦区和乌鲁木齐垦区部队，并开办了采棉机训练班，今年将有二十八台采棉机参加收花工作。
