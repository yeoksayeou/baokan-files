    Why Pull Normal School Students to Switch to Other Jobs Editor:
    The state cultivates normal school students in order to solve the shortage of teachers. However, some government organs and government workers do not act according to the needs of the state and privately recruit or pull away normal school students to do other jobs. For example, our school student Liu Fenghua, in September 1954, asked for leave under false pretenses to apply for the training department of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and was admitted. After we discovered this situation, we contacted this unit many times, explaining that it was not permissible to arbitrarily recruit normal school students who were still studying, and pointed out that if there was a real need for work, the transfer procedures should be handled through the Hebei Provincial Department of Education. However, this unit did not pay attention to our opinions, and this matter has not been resolved until now. Wang Xiufeng, a junior normal school student in our school, is the wife of a staff member of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China. After graduating last summer, she was designated by a higher-level organ to be transferred and assigned to work in the Xingtai County Cooperative. Some parents also have incorrect views about normal schools. Chen Chi (a state organ worker), the father of Chen Yutao, a third-year student at our school, not only repeatedly wrote letters to encourage his son to apply for university after graduation, but also wrote to our school principal, hoping to have his son assigned to study at university.
    These situations have a very unfavorable impact on our teaching work. For example, after Wang Xiufeng was assigned to work in the cooperative, many students had opinions. They questioned the school: Is being an elementary school teacher glorious or not? Why can Wang Xiufeng's husband use his authority to transfer her away? These questions are difficult for us to answer. In order to prevent this situation from continuing, we hope you will publish this letter to draw everyone's attention.
    Xingtai Normal School, Hebei Province

### 为什么拉师范学生改行做别的工作

    为什么拉师范学生改行做别的工作编辑同志：
    国家培养师范学校学生的目的，是为了解决师资不足的问题；但是有一些机关和机关工作人员却不根据国家需要，私自录用或拉走师范学生做别的工作。例如，我校学生刘凤华，在一九五四年九月间借故请假投考中国人民解放军某部训练部，就被录取了。我们发现这个情况后，曾多次同这个部队联系，说明不能任意录用在学的师范生，并指出如果确因工作需要，应通过河北省教育厅办理调动手续。但是这个部队没有重视我们的意见，使这件事情直到现在不能解决。我校初级师范学生王秀凤，是中共邢台地委会一个工作人员的爱人，她在去年暑假毕业后，就被上级机关指名要走，分配到邢台县合作社工作。还有些家长对师范学校有不正确的看法。本校三年级学生陈玉韬的父亲陈墀（国家机关工作人员）不但屡次写信动员他的儿子毕业后投考大学，并且还给我校校长来信，希望分配他的儿子入大学学习。
    这些情况对我们的教学工作有很不利的影响。像王秀凤被分配到合作社工作后，很多同学都有意见。他们向学校质问：当小学教师光荣不光荣？为什么王秀凤的爱人可以利用职权把她调走？这些问题使我们很难解答。为了不让这种情况继续发生希望你们发表这封信，以引起大家的注意。河北省邢台师范学校
