Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong, the Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on August 29th at the suggestion of the US side. At the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged a strong protest with the US side regarding the US's recent instigation of the Syngman Rhee gang to openly carry out provocative acts attempting to undermine the Armistice Agreement, and the US's actions attempting to unilaterally dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

Major General Zheng Guolu also demanded that immediate and effective measures be taken to eliminate the serious threat to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, to immediately restore the normal state of all ports in the US military control area, and to ensure the safety of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission personnel and the normal work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams.

At this meeting, the US side openly clamored for the "dissolution" of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, claiming that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was "incompetent" and "useless." The US side attempted to evade its serious responsibility for violating the Armistice Agreement, and again used fabricated incidents and lies that had long been exposed by the Korean-Chinese side to slander and vilify the Korean-Chinese side, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and its Polish and Czechoslovak members.

In response, Major General Zheng Guolu cited the facts and various evidence confirmed at the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission over the past two years since the armistice, thoroughly exposing and denouncing the US side's crimes of continuously violating the Armistice Agreement during the past two years since the armistice. Major General Zheng Guolu once again demanded that the US side, in the face of undeniable evidence, acknowledge the facts, be responsible for violating the Armistice Agreement, and take necessary measures in accordance with the Armistice Agreement to ensure that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is free from any threats and obstructions so that they can perform their duties and tasks.

Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out that if the US side disregards the legitimate demands and advice of the Korean-Chinese side, and refuses to fulfill the Armistice Agreement with practical actions and facts, and insists on attempting to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission unilaterally, it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

In his speech at the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu said: "Recently, your side and the Syngman Rhee gang colluded to carry out provocative acts attempting to openly undermine the Armistice Agreement, but it brought about results contrary to your intentions. The Syngman Rhee gang's despicable attacks and threats cannot intimidate anyone. This has not only been met with blows from our side and condemnation from peace-loving countries and people around the world, but has even been opposed by some of your 'allies' who sent troops to participate in the Korean War, and has completely exposed your consistent deliberate attempt to undermine the Armistice Agreement and 'abolish' the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission."

Major General Zheng Guolu said: "Your side is attempting to be unrestricted by the Armistice Agreement and unsupervised by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and arbitrarily transport large quantities of war materials into South Korea in order to further arm the Syngman Rhee gang, attempting to provoke war in Korea again. Everyone knows that recently in Washington, officials of the US government and the Syngman Rhee gang formulated a plan to further expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army and equip it with new weapons such as jet aircraft and atomic cannons, and are now preparing to implement this plan.

To implement this plan, as your side itself has openly admitted, your side wants to undermine the Armistice Agreement and be free from its constraints. Therefore, your side is determined to attempt to undermine the Armistice Agreement and abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission."

Major General Zheng Guolu finally pointed out: "The Korean Armistice Agreement, as a solemn whole, must be fully implemented in all its provisions; for the peace of Korea, Asia, and the whole world, it must be maintained. Today, your side has finally taken off its mask at this meeting, and blatantly expressed your attempt to undermine the Armistice Agreement and 'abolish' the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which you have long sought to achieve through various despicable methods. The reason why your side is hostile to the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is because they do not conceal and do not want to conceal your side's actions that undermine the Armistice Agreement; the reason why your side, disregarding the decency of civilized human society, constantly repeats malicious slanders is because your side has included the abolition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on your agenda. I once again lodge a serious protest against your side's attempt to undermine the Armistice Agreement."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong, at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on August 29th, Major General Zheng Guolu, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, protested to the US side regarding the US's adoption of new measures to deprive the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at various ports in South Korea of their rights, for the purpose of abolishing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

According to reports from the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed in South Korea: Recently, the US side has not only failed to take any effective practical measures against the Syngman Rhee group's crazy atrocities of infringing upon the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and threatening the safety of the Neutral Nations personnel, but has instead used this as an excuse to further obstruct and interfere with the activities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. The US side prohibits the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams from conducting spot checks, and prohibits Neutral Nations personnel from going to the ports designated by the Armistice Agreement, and prohibits them from conducting inspections and supervisions on the ground by walking or riding in vehicles. The US side even claimed: "Inspections should be limited to relying on helicopters, and helicopters should not land, but only conduct inspections in the air."

It is very obvious that it is impossible to effectively inspect and supervise the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materials by riding in an airplane in the air or sitting in the team's barracks. Therefore, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has expressed its disagreement with this method. However, the US side stubbornly insisted at the meeting that "air inspections relying on helicopters" seemed to be "the most effective," attempting to legitimize its planned restriction and obstruction of the work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams.

Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out at the meeting: The measures that the US side is taking are to deprive the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams of the right to perform their tasks, which is a clear violation of the Armistice Agreement. Major General Zheng Guolu once again demanded that the US side must fulfill the obligations it has undertaken under the Armistice Agreement, and immediately take necessary measures within the US-controlled area to ensure that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams can carry out their normal work.

    就美李破坏停战协定并企图片面解散中立国监察委员会问题
    朝中方面在军事停战委员会提出强硬抗议
    新华社平壤三十一日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会在美方建议下在八月二十九日举行会议。朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将在会上就美方最近唆使李承晚匪帮公然进行企图破坏停战协定的挑衅行为和美方企图片面解散中立国监察委员会的行动向美方提出强硬抗议。
    郑国禄少将并且要求立即采取有效措施，以消除对中立国监察委员会的严重威胁，立即恢复美方军事控制地区内一切口岸的正常状态，保障中立国监察委员会人员的安全和中立国视察小组的正常工作。
    美方在这次会议上公然叫嚣“解散”中立国监察委员会，声称中立国监察委员会是“无能”和“无用”的。美方企图回避它违反停战协定的严重责任，并又以早已被朝中方面揭穿了的虚构的事件和谎言，对朝中方面、中立国监察委员会和其中的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克成员进行诽谤和诬蔑。
    对此，郑国禄少将列举了停战后两年间在军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会上确证了的事实和各种证据，彻底地揭穿和斥责了美方在停战后两年间不断违反停战协定的罪行。郑国禄少将再一次要求美方在不可抹煞的证据面前，承认事实，对违反停战协定的罪行负责，并且根据停战协定采取必要的措施使中立国监察委员会不受任何威胁和阻挠，使他们能够执行他们的职责和任务。
    郑国禄少将指出，如果美方无视朝中方面的正当要求和劝告，而以实际行动和事实拒绝履行停战协定，坚持企图废除中立国监察委员会的片面行动的话，它就必须对由此而产生的一切后果承担全部的责任。
    郑国禄少将在会上的发言中说：“最近你方和李承晚匪帮合谋进行了企图公然破坏停战协定的挑衅行为，但是它带来了同你方意图相反的结果。李承晚匪帮的卑劣的攻击和威胁不能吓唬任何人，这不仅遭到了我方的打击和全世界爱好和平国家及人民的谴责，甚至也遭到了出兵参加朝鲜战争的你方一部分‘同盟国’的反对，并且完全暴露了你方一贯蓄意企图破坏停战协定和‘废除’中立国监察委员会的阴谋。”
    郑国禄少将说：“你方企图不受停战协定的限制和中立国监察委员会的监视，任意地把大量的作战物资运入南朝鲜，以进一步武装李承晚匪帮，企图在朝鲜再挑起战争。大家都知道，最近在华顿盛，美国政府的官员和李承晚匪帮制定了关于进一步扩充李承晚傀儡军队，并以喷气式飞机和原子炮等新型武器来武装它的计划，现在正为实行这个计划而进行准备工作。
    为了实行这个计划，正如你方自己公开承认的
  一样，你方要破坏停战协定，不受它的拘束。因此，你方决心企图破坏停战协定，取消中立国监察委员会。”
    郑国禄少将最后指出：“朝鲜停战协定作为庄严的整体，它的任何条款必须全部实施；为了朝鲜和亚洲以及全世界的和平，必须维护它。今天，你方终于在这个会议上脱掉假面具，露骨地表示了你方从很久以来一向以各种卑鄙的方法谋求破坏停战协定和‘废除’中立国监察委员会的企图。你方之所以敌视中立国监察委员会的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员，是因为他们不掩盖并且也不想掩盖你方破坏停战协定的行为；你方之所以不顾文明的人类社会的体面，不断地重复充满恶意的中伤，是因为你方把取消中立国监察委员会列入了你们的日程。我对你方破坏停战协定的企图再一次提出严重抗议。”
    新华社平壤三十一日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在军事停战委员会八月二十九日的会议上，朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将就美方在废除中立国监察委员会的目的下，采取新的措施来剥夺驻在南朝鲜各口岸的中立国视察小组的权利一事，向美方提出了抗议。
    据驻在南朝鲜的中立国视察小组报告：最近美方对于李承晚集团侵害中立国监察委员会的工作、威胁中立国人员安全的疯狂暴行，不但不采取任何有效的实际措施，反而以此为借口，对中立国视察小组的活动，进一步施加阻碍和干涉。美方禁止中立国视察小组进行抽查，并且禁止中立国人员前往停战协定所指定的口岸，禁止他们在地面上步行或乘坐车辆进行视察和监督。美方竟主张：“视察只限于依靠直升飞机，不要让直升飞机着陆，只能在空中进行视察”。
    十分明显，乘坐飞机在空中，或坐在小组的营房里，不可能有效地视察和监督军事人员的轮换和作战物资的替换。因此，中立国监察委员会对这种办法已表示不同意。但是，美方在会议上固执地把“依靠直升飞机的空中视察”说成似乎是“最为有效”，企图使它有计划地限制和阻挠中立国视察小组工作的行为合法化。
    郑国禄少将在会上指出：美方所正在采取的措施是要剥夺中立国视察小组执行任务的权利，是明显地违反停战协定。郑国禄少将再一次要求美方必须履行根据停战协定所承担的义务，并且在美方控制地区内立即采取必要措施，以保障中立国视察小组进行正常的工作。
