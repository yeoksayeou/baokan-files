    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet government's decision to build the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station is now five years old.

    The director of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station Construction Office, Mr. Gayevsky, told a TASS reporter: Over the past five years, all our staff have done a tremendous amount of work. The hydroelectric power station builders have tamed the Volga River. Machine operators have moved seventy-five million cubic meters of earth on the main building alone. However, the decisive factor in construction now is no longer earthwork but concrete work. Since the beginning of construction, 400,000 cubic meters of concrete have been completed, of which 215,000 cubic meters were laid this year. The speed of work is constantly increasing. At the beginning of this year, we were laying 9,000 to 11,000 cubic meters of concrete per month, but in July and August, the concrete laid had increased to 35,000 cubic meters.

    Currently, the main concrete works are being carried out at the location of the first four generating units of the power station and at the assembly yard.

    Recently, our staff has been preparing to start the concrete work on the spillway dam, where at least 40,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete will be laid by the end of the year.

    A strong production base has been built on the construction site of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, which guarantees the construction of the main projects of this hydraulic hub. The concrete factory has already begun supplying products, with a production capacity of 8,000 cubic meters of concrete per day; the machine repair factory, the automobile repair factory, the steel bar factory, the woodworking complex, and many other factories have all begun production.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Council of Ministers' decision to build the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, the builders of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station set a world record by laying 19,050 cubic meters of concrete per day.

    This is the second world record created by the builders of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station after launching a socialist emulation campaign to welcome the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The first world record was set on August 19th. They laid a total of 17,050 cubic meters of concrete in one day.

    This record greatly exceeded the highest record of 15,700 cubic meters of concrete laid in one day by the United States when building the Grand Coulee Dam.

    After the builders of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station created this world record, the Minister of Power Station Construction of the Soviet Union, Mr. Loginov, sent them a congratulatory telegram.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The builders of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station are striving to start the first generating unit one year ahead of schedule on September 21st—the fifth anniversary of the Soviet Council of Ministers' decision to build the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station—and to put another three generating units into production before the end of this year.

    Currently, the hydroelectric power station construction site is showing a busy scene before completion. In addition to accelerating the installation of the second generator, the construction workers are also raising and reinforcing the dam that blocks the Dnieper River bed, and the artificial reservoir "Kakhovka Sea" is gradually forming. This reservoir will extend from Zaporozhye to New Kakhovka, with a length of 250 kilometers; its width will reach 25 to 30 kilometers, with a total area of more than 200,000 hectares, and can store 14 billion cubic meters of water. Before the first generating unit of the power station is started, the workers will first accumulate 5 billion cubic meters of water in this reservoir. In order to ensure that the huge Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station with a power generation capacity of 250,000 kilowatts can transmit a powerful current for the first time from September 21st, the high-voltage transmission lines erected from New Kakhovka to many areas in southern Ukraine are also about to be completed.

    苏联三大水电站五年来建设成就巨大
    据新华社讯  苏联政府发布兴建斯大林格勒水电站的决定已经满五周年了。
    斯大林格勒水电站建设处主任加耶夫斯基对塔斯社记者说：五年来，我们全体员工作了巨大的工作。水电站建筑工人驯服了伏尔加河。机器操使者仅仅在主要建筑上就处理了七千五百万公方的泥土。但是，现在在建设上起决定性作用的，已不是土方工程而是混凝土工程了。从建设开始到现在已经完成了四十万公方混凝土工程，其中二十一万五千公方是今年敷设的。工作的速度在不断地增加。今年年初，我们每月敷设九千到一万一千公方的混凝土，但是七月和八月所敷设的混凝土已经增加到三万五千公方。
    现在主要的混凝土工程是在电力站的头四个联动机的地方和装配场上进行的。
    最近，我们员工准备着手进行溢流坝的混凝土工程，到年底这里将敷设至少四万公方的钢筋混凝土。
    在斯大林格勒水电站建设工地上，已经建设了一个强大的生产基地，它保证着这个水力枢纽的主要工程的建设。混凝土工厂已经开始供应产品，它的生产力为每昼夜八千公方的混凝土；机器修理工厂、汽车修理工厂、钢筋工厂、木材加工联合工厂和许多其他工厂都已开始生产。
    据新华社讯  古比雪夫水电站建筑者在苏联部长会议发布建设古比雪夫水电站的决定的五周年前夕，创造了每昼夜敷设一万九千零五十公方混凝土的世界纪录。
    这已经是古比雪夫水电站建筑者为迎接苏联共产党第二十次代表大会而展开社会主义竞赛后的第二次创造的世界纪录。第一次创造世界纪录是在八月十九日。他们一昼夜共敷设了一万七千零五十公方的混凝土。
    这个纪录，大大超过了美国在建筑大古力闸时所创造的一昼夜敷设一万五千七百公方混凝土的最高纪录。
    古比雪夫水电站建筑者创造了这个世界纪录后，苏联电站建设部部长洛吉诺夫已经去电向他们祝贺。
    据新华社讯  卡霍夫卡水电站的建筑者，正在争取在九月二十一日——苏联部长会议发布兴建卡霍夫卡水电站决定的五周年，提前一年开动第一台联动机，并且争取在今年年底以前把另外三台联动机投入生产。
    现在，水电站工地上呈现出了竣工前的繁忙景象。建筑工人除了加速安装第二台发电机外，并且正在加高和加固拦断第聂伯河床的堤坝，人工水库“卡霍夫卡海”正在日渐形成。这个水库将从萨坡罗什伸展到新卡霍夫卡，长达二百五十公里；它的宽度将达二十五公里到三十公里，总面积有二十多万公顷，能蓄水一百四十亿立方公尺。在电力站第一台联动机开动以前，工人们将使这个水库先蓄积五十亿立方公尺的水。为了保证能从九月二十一日起，使发电能力为二十五万瓩的巨大的卡霍夫卡水电站第一次输送出强大的电流，工人们在从新卡霍夫卡到乌克兰南部许多地区所架设的高压输电线也快要架设完成了。（附图片）
