    Large Numbers of Mutual Aid Teams and Individual Farmers
    Actively Request to Establish and Join Agricultural Cooperatives
    (Report from this newspaper) A large number of mutual aid teams and individual farmers in Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Yunnan are actively requesting to establish and join agricultural production cooperatives.
    In the Jinan area of ​​Shanxi Province, before August 15th, more than 2,580 mutual aid teams, including more than 22,100 farming households, had requested to join cooperatives. According to statistics from the Xin County area as of the end of August, 1,070 mutual aid teams and individual farmers, totaling more than 10,600 households, actively requested to join existing cooperatives and establish new ones. Some mutual aid teams requesting to establish agricultural production cooperatives have made preliminary preparations for establishing cooperatives and have begun collective production. In Xin County, many mutual aid teams, in addition to collective production, are also considering selecting key members to establish cooperatives. In An'yi, Yaogou, and other nine villages in Nangou Township, Xin County, 224 mutual aid team members and individual farmers, after discussion and consultation, are preparing to establish nine new cooperatives and have initially selected directors, deputy directors, accountants, and other leaders within the cooperatives.
    In Haicheng County, Liaoning Province, 118 mutual aid teams in the Sixth and Ninth Districts have registered to prepare for establishing cooperatives after the autumn harvest. The Chen Zhongqi mutual aid team in Guchengzi Village, Sixth District, has already selected a cooperative director, accountant, and production team leader, and is just waiting for approval to establish the cooperative. Liaoyang County estimates that approximately 40,000 farming households throughout the county are requesting to join cooperatives. County officials visited 63 farmers outside the cooperatives with varying backgrounds in Bahuangdi Village, and 28 of them requested to join cooperatives this year. Due to the active requests from farmers in various regions to participate in agricultural production cooperatives, leaders in various counties generally feel that the originally planned development of agricultural production cooperatives was too low. Counties such as Gaiping, Haicheng, Kuandian, Liaozhong, Yingkou, and Liaoyang have preliminarily revised their original plans. It is estimated that approximately 15,000 new agricultural production cooperatives will be developed throughout the province this winter and next spring.
    In Jiangsu Province, mutual aid teams have developed to more than 433,700, and the number of farming households participating in the teams has accounted for 51.44 percent of the total number of farming households. According to incomplete statistics from the five special districts of Zhenjiang, Nantong, Yancheng, Yangzhou, and Huaiyin, among the existing mutual aid teams, there are more than 68,300 with strong core members, a good foundation of mutual assistance, and where the masses voluntarily request to establish cooperatives. As of the end of August in the Huaiyin Special District, 11,191 mutual aid teams were actively considering establishing cooperatives, and more than 136,000 farming households had requested to join cooperatives. The mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives are all welcoming the establishment of cooperatives with practical actions to improve production.
    In Yunnan Province, the work of establishing a large number of agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest is being extensively and deeply carried out in rural areas, and the vast number of farmers are requesting to join agricultural production cooperatives. In most cooperative-building areas, more than 90 percent of farmers are requesting to join cooperatives, setting off a wave of enthusiasm for establishing cooperatives. In areas where various ethnic minorities live and in areas where multiple ethnic groups live together, people of all ethnic groups have improved their awareness after fully studying the policies and are also enthusiastically requesting to establish cooperatives. In the two dams of Mosha and Gasa in Xinping County, most of the Dai farmers in the eight Dai autonomous townships are voluntarily applying to establish cooperatives. When Limin Township in Quxi was establishing cooperatives, Miao farmers came to register while playing the lusheng and beating drums.

    山西辽宁江苏云南大批互助组和个体农民
    积极要求建立和参加农业合作社
    本报讯　山西、辽宁、江苏、云南大批互助组和个体农民积极要求建立和参加农业生产合作社。
    山西省晋南区在八月十五日前，要求入社的互助组已达两千五百八十多个，包括两万二千一百多户农民。忻县区截至八月底的统计，全区有一千零七十个互助组和个体农民，共一万零六百多户，积极要求加入老社和建立新社。要求建立农业生产合作社的互助组，有的已作了建社的初步准备，并开始集体生产。忻县区的不少互助组除集体生产外，还酝酿选拔出建社骨干。忻县南沟乡安邑、窑沟等九个村的二百二十四户互助组组员和个体农民，经过酝酿串连和协议，准备新建社九个，并初步选定了正副社长、会计等社内领导人员。
    辽宁省海城县六区和九区已有一百一十八个互助组报名准备秋后建社；六区古城子村陈忠旗互助组已选了社主任、会计和生产队长，只等着批准建社。辽阳县估计全县约有四万户农民要求入社。县里工作人员在八荒地村访问了不同成分的六十三户社外农民，其中有二十八户要求今年入社。由于各地农民积极要求参加农业生产合作社，各县领导方面普遍地感到原订的发展农业生产合作社计划低了。盖平、海城、宽甸、辽中、营口和辽阳等县已初步修改了原来的计划。预计全省在今冬明春将新发展一万五千个左右的农业生产合作社。
    江苏全省互助组已发展到四十三万三千七百多个，入组的农户已占总农户的百分之五十一点四四。根据镇江、南通、盐城、扬州、淮阴等五个专区不完全的统计，在现有的互助组中，骨干较强、互助基础较好、群众自愿要求办社的就在六万八千三百个以上。淮阴专区截至八月底，已有一万一千一百九十一个互助组积极酝酿办社，要求入社的农民已有十三万六千多户。各地准备办社的互助组都正以搞好生产的实际行动迎接办社。
    云南省秋前建立大批农业生产合作社的工作，正在各地农村广泛深入展开，广大农民纷纷要求参加农业生产合作社。大部分建社地区，百分之九十以上的农民要求入社，掀起了办社热潮。在各少数民族聚居区和民族杂居区，各族人民充分学习政策后，提高了觉悟，也热烈要求办社。新平县磨沙和戛洒两个坝子里，八个傣族自治乡的傣族农民，大多自愿申请办社。曲溪利民乡建社时，苗族农民吹着葫芦笙，敲锣打鼓前来报名。
