    10,000 Kilograms of Squid Mistakenly Shipped to Xinjiang

    To the Editor:
    In July of this year, the Xinjiang Provincial Trade Company suddenly received 10,000 kilograms of squid. The people of the Xinjiang region do not have the habit of eating squid, and the Xinjiang Provincial Trade Company has never ordered squid. However, this batch of squid traveled a long distance to Xinjiang, which is truly baffling.
    After inquiring everywhere, it turned out that this batch of squid was sent by the Xi'an Municipal Trade Company to the Gansu Provincial Trade Company. When the shipper at the native produce warehouse of the Xi'an Municipal Trade Company was dispatching the goods, they mistakenly wrote the consignee as "Wang Chao-ran, stationed in Lanzhou, Xinjiang Provincial Trade Company." This error was discovered the day before the goods were shipped, but they believed that the goods had already been registered at the station. If the registration were changed, the railway would impose a fine. Therefore, they let it be shipped. Afterwards, the warehouse only noted in the documents sent to the Gansu Provincial Trade Company, "Please contact Wang Chao-ran at the Xinjiang Provincial Trade Company to pick up the goods." However, this batch of goods was shipped all the way to Urumqi and accumulated in the warehouse of the Xinjiang Provincial Trade Company.
    According to the Lanzhou market price, this 10,000 kilograms of squid is worth more than 120,000 yuan. The freight from Lanzhou to Urumqi, calculated at the lowest standard, will cost more than 5,500 yuan. The native produce warehouse of the Xi'an Municipal Trade Company was afraid that their unit would be fined, resulting in such a significant loss. This is intolerable. I suggest that the higher leading organs investigate this matter and give the relevant derelict personnel the punishment they deserve.

### 一万公斤鱿鱼错运到新疆

    一万公斤鱿鱼错运到新疆编辑同志：
    今年七月间，新疆省贸易公司突然收到鱿鱼一万公斤。新疆地区的人民没有吃鱿鱼的习惯，新疆省贸易公司也从来没有订购过鱿鱼，而这批鱿鱼却长途跋涉来到了新疆，这真是一件令人摸不到头脑的事。
    经过到处打听，原来这批鱿鱼是西安市贸易公司发给甘肃省贸易公司的。西安市贸易公司土产货栈的发货人在发货的时候，误将收货方写成了“新疆省贸易公司驻兰州王超然”。这个错误在货物运出的前一天已经发现了，但是他们认为这批货物已经在车站上登记过了，如果更改登记要被铁路方面罚款，所以就让它运走了。事后，这个货栈只是在寄给甘肃省贸易公司的单据里注明，“请到新疆省贸易公司王超然处联系提货。”但是这批货物却一直运到了乌鲁木齐，就积压在新疆省贸易公司的仓库里了。
    这一万公斤鱿鱼依兰州市价计算，约值十二万多元；从兰州到乌鲁木齐的运价，按最低标准计算，也要五千五百多元。西安市贸易公司土产货栈为了怕本单位被罚款，结果造成这样重大的损失。这是令人不能容忍的。我建议上级领导机关检查这件事情，并给有关失职人员以应得的处分。
