Vice Premier Tian Jiyun met with the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Pichai Ratanachuen, and his delegation this evening at the Great Hall of the People.

During the meeting, Tian Jiyun praised Pichai as an "old friend who has made significant contributions to Sino-Thai friendship" and quoted the saying "The true measure of a horse is over a long journey, and the true measure of a person is over a long period of time" to illustrate that China and Thailand have always supported each other, and that the relationship between the two countries can withstand any test.

Pichai stated that Thai Prime Minister Chatichai has repeatedly emphasized that the events that occurred in Beijing this past spring and summer are purely China's internal affairs. Thailand's policy of continuously developing friendly cooperation with China in all aspects will not change.

After the meeting, Tian Jiyun hosted a banquet in honor of the Thai guests. In his speech at the banquet, he said that frequent exchanges between the leaders of China and Thailand and between various levels of the two countries have deepened mutual understanding and friendship, and have strongly promoted mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields such as economics, technology, and culture.

When discussing the Cambodian issue, Tian Jiyun pointed out that the Chinese government has always believed that the Cambodian issue must be resolved in a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable manner. Only in this way can the Cambodian people be freed from the suffering of war, and the peace and stability of the region be effectively maintained. For a long time, Thailand has insisted on international justice and has played an important role in seeking a political solution to the Cambodian issue. We will continue to strengthen close cooperation with Thailand and other ASEAN countries to achieve this goal.

Deputy Prime Minister Pichai, in his impromptu speech, said that just now, Vice Premier Tian mentioned that China has repeatedly announced that the reform and opening-up policy, the independent and peaceful foreign policy, and the policy of strengthening friendly cooperation with neighboring countries that have been determined in the past will not change. This makes Thailand and many other countries in the world happy.

Deputy Prime Minister Pichai arrived in Beijing this afternoon at the invitation of the Chinese government to begin his friendly visit to China.
