	Fewer Factories, More Transportation
	Yang Shouyue, Guizhou Provincial Department of Transportation

	Guizhou, a barren land in ancient times, has a strong demand for roads. Folk sayings such as "To get rich, build roads first" and "Roads into the Miao villages, more votes for the county magistrate" fully express the Guizhou people's feelings for road transportation. Guizhou's backwardness, whether in the past or today, is largely due to its backward transportation.

	By the end of 1988, Guizhou Province had 30,445 kilometers of paved roads, 15 times more than at the beginning of the liberation. However, from the perspective of coordinated development of various sectors of the national economy, road transportation is undoubtedly a constraining factor.

	Guizhou is known as the "Western Coal Sea," with proven reserves of 490 million tons, ranking fourth in the country and first in the south. However, the abundant coal resources cannot contribute to the country. Why? Because of transportation constraints, they cannot be transported out. Guizhou is one of the four major tobacco-producing areas in the country, with an annual output of 450 million catties. During the harvest season, due to poor roads and inconvenient transportation, saving one side means losing the other, saving tobacco means losing rapeseed. Guizhou has a total forest stock of 1.3 billion cubic meters. Due to inconvenient transportation, the amount of timber rotting in some areas is equal to the amount transported out.

	The reasons for Guizhou's backward road transportation are multifaceted. First, road transportation construction has not been included in the national basic construction plan. The state spends money building various types of factories, and there are also many non-production projects, but very little money is spent on building and improving roads. It is hoped that the proportion of road construction investment in the national plan will gradually increase.

	Second, the toll revenue should be strictly used for road maintenance and improvement. Theoretically, it is not appropriate to levy "two funds" on the transportation department and enterprises, and in practice, it is "a drop in the bucket." It is suggested that the state exempts these levies.

	Third, the sources of road transportation construction funds should be expanded. It is appropriate to slightly increase the toll and vehicle purchase tax rates, "taking from the vehicles and using for the roads," to promote the development of road construction.

	Fourth, the policy of using labor in lieu of relief and public-private cooperation should be continued. It is hoped that the central government's policy of subsidizing road and river repairs will continue. This policy is deeply loved by the people, especially the people in remote and poor mountainous areas who see cars for the first time. The people call it a "great benevolent act" and a "historical monument."

	Our country, in its development, has limited financial resources and many urgent tasks. When encountering contradictions, squeezing and suppressing transportation, over time, the leg of transportation becomes shorter and shorter, losing balance. This phenomenon should not be repeated. What if the funds are insufficient? "Fewer factories, more transportation" can achieve twice the result with half the effort, truly implementing the State Council's industrial policy.

### 少办点工厂　多办点交通

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面——交通运输问题讨论

    少办点工厂　多办点交通
    贵州省交通厅　杨守岳
    贵州，古代的不毛之地。贵州人民对公路的渴求十分强烈，在民间流传着许多美好的说法：“要致富，先修路”；“公路修进苗家寨，县长选票多起来”等等，充分表达了贵州人民对公路交通的感情。贵州之所以落后，无论是过去还是今天，交通落后是一个重要的原因。
    到一九八八年底，贵州省公路通车里程三万零四百四十五公里，比解放初期增加十五倍。但是，从国民经济各部门协调发展的角度看，公路交通无疑是一个制约的因素。
    贵州素有西南煤海之称，已探明的储量有四百九十多亿吨，居全国第四、南方之首。然而，丰富的煤炭资源不能为国家作贡献，什么原因？受交通制约，运不出来。贵州是全国四大烤烟产区之一，年产量达四百五十万担。每到收获季节，道路不好，交通不便，保了东边就保不了西边，保了烤烟就保不了油菜。贵州林木总蓄积一点三亿多万立方米。由于交通不便，采伐的木材在有的地区腐烂的和运出的一样多。
    贵州公路交通落后，制约因素是多方面的。首先，公路交通建设没有能够列入国家基本建设计划。国家花钱建设各式各样的工厂，非生产性项目也不少，却很少花钱建设公路，改造公路。希望在国家计划中逐步提高公路建设投资比重。
    第二，养路费收入要严格用于公路的维护和改善。对交通部门和企业开征“两基金”从理论上说不过去，在实际上是“杯水车薪”，建议国家免征。
    第三，要扩大公路交通建设的资金来源。适当提高养路费、车购费的征收费率，“取之于车，用之于路”，促进公路建设发展。
    第四，要继续实行以工代赈、民办公助政策，希望中央补助修路治河政策继续下去，这项政策深受群众拥护，特别是边远贫困山区的人民群众第一次见到了汽车，群众称之为“伟大的德政”，“历史的丰碑”。
    我们国家在发展中，财力有限，急需办的事情很多。遇到矛盾，挤交通、压交通，久而久之，交通这条腿就愈来愈短，失去了平衡。这种现象再不能重复。资金不够怎么办？“少办点工厂，多办点交通”就可以事半功倍，真正把国务院产业政策落到实处。
