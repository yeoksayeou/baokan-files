	In the wake of China's announcement to suspend diplomatic relations with Liberia, the Chinese Embassy in Liberia closed today.

	All diplomatic staff and employees of the embassy, along with their families, attended the flag-lowering ceremony held this morning. Chinese Ambassador Cao Yuanxin and his wife departed last night and have returned to China. The rest of the embassy staff will return to China in batches by the end of the month.

	The Chinese government's aid projects will soon be halted, and Chinese experts working in Liberia will return to China in succession this month.

	Local officials and workers who had worked with the Chinese experts were moved to tears upon hearing the news of their departure. Some said, "The People's Republic of China has been sincerely helping us." An official from the Liberian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Chinese diplomats, "I firmly believe that, in the near future, the ambassador of the People's Republic of China will return to Liberia."

    我关闭驻利比里亚大使馆
    新华社蒙罗维亚十月十一日电  在中国宣布中止与利比里亚的外交关系后，中国驻利比里亚大使馆今天关闭。
    使馆的全体外交官和工作人员及其家属参加了今天上午举行的降国旗仪式。中国大使曹元欣和夫人已于昨晚离开这里回国。使馆的全体人员将在月底前分批返回祖国。
    中国政府援建的各个项目不久都将中止，在利比里亚工作的中国专家也将于本月陆续回国。
    曾同中国专家一道工作的当地官员和工人在听说中国朋友就要离开的消息后，热泪盈眶。有的说中华人民共和国是在诚心诚意帮助我们。利比里亚外交部的一位官员对中国大使馆的外交官说：“我坚信，在不久的将来，中华人民共和国的大使将重新回到利比里亚。”
