There Are Still Rational and Fair-Minded People in the United States

Chen Jiayou

Editor's Note: Professor Chen Jiayou is from Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He is 78 years old this year. He graduated from Shanghai's Jinan University in the 1930s, studied in the United States in the 1930s, and obtained a Ph.D. in Law from Indiana University in 1940. He later worked as a researcher at the International Relations Research Institute of the U.S. Department of Defense for over 30 years. After retiring, he taught constitutional law at Howard University in Washington, D.C.

The following article is provided by Professor Chen for publication in the overseas edition of "Outlook." The publication has added a few subheadings for the convenience of readers.

This time, China's student movement is not a democratic movement! The style of the student movement is completely contrary to democracy, but it is merely a reappearance of traditional feudal autocracy, repeating historical turmoil to change dynasties.

This time, China's student movement colluded with overseas anti-China elements to launch a rumor campaign. Initially, they blamed the Chinese government for corruption, then claimed that the Chinese government is authoritarian, and later fabricated the lie of the Tiananmen Square massacre. This created a storm, coercing tens of thousands of people to gather in Tiananmen Square for eight weeks, aiming to destroy China's international position and domestic economy.

The rumors stirred up by the student movement were merely a prelude to the turmoil. Initially, they blamed the government for corruption, and corruption became synonymous with the government; then, with the slogan "No Freedom, No Life," they labeled the Chinese government as authoritarian, depriving the people of their freedom; and finally, with "Hunger Strike to Save the Nation," they portrayed the current government as one that would destroy China. These rumors obscured the truth, just as the Yellow River floods have submerged countless people and economic and cultural centers for thousands of years, buried in the earth, never to see the light of day.

The rumor campaign launched by this student movement colluded with overseas anti-China elements, using modern communication tools to spread rumors worldwide. The power of many voices turned rumors into facts. Of course, spreading rumors has a definite purpose and a well-thought-out plan, just like after the fall of the Qin Dynasty, King Xiang of Chu and King Liu of Han fought for the throne.

In 202 BC, at the Battle of Gaixia, Xiang Yu was surrounded and could not escape, making him extremely confused. That night, Chu songs came from all directions, startling Xiang Yu, who thought his army's morale had collapsed and surrendered to Liu Bang. His subordinates also suspected each other, causing confusion between friends and enemies. Xiang Yu did not dare to fight and fled that night, reaching the Wujiang River with only 30 horsemen. With the Wujiang River in front and pursuers behind, the situation was dire, and he could not reverse the tide. Ashamed to face his parents in Jiangdong, a hero who could "pull mountains and cover the world" ended up with no way out and committed suicide. The Battle of Gaixia was Liu Bang's pre-planned strategy to destroy Xiang Yu, using the "Surrounded by Chu Songs" tactic to shake Xiang Yu's resolve. This is the first recorded psychological warfare in Chinese history where a rumor campaign succeeded.

The rumor campaign launched by this student movement was indeed a storm, with a powerful momentum, coercing tens of thousands of people to gather in Beijing's Tiananmen Square for eight weeks without retreating, showing the power of the rumor campaign. This student movement aimed to destroy the Chinese government through a middle breakthrough, using the condition of dismantling the government as its goal and the tactic of occupying Tiananmen Square as its means to blackmail the government. Thus, the student movement narrowed its scope of attack, focusing on the government leaders, spreading rumors that the government leaders had secretly taken the country's gold reserves abroad to maintain a life of luxury after fleeing the country; announcing that Deng Xiaoping had died, Yang Shangkun had fled, Li Peng had been assassinated by his guards, and was critically injured; the central government's Zhongnanhai had three fires, still burning; the 27th Army had been surrounded by other troops in Beijing's southern suburbs and was in fierce battle, indicating that civil war had broken out; various regional governments had declared independence, and China had fallen into a state of anarchy, and so on.

The highly authoritative _New York Times_ and _Washington Post_ in the United States surprisingly revived their old tricks of publishing sensational news, disregarding the accuracy of the reports, exaggerating the rumors as reliable news, and using large headlines to publish them on the front pages. Some columnists also wrote special articles to attack the Chinese government, elevating the student movement as a struggle for democracy. However, these one-sided words based on rumors could not withstand the test of time and were eventually proven false; yet, they still did not admit defeat and continued their anti-China stance, always opposing China. Some overseas Chinese who originally harbored hostility towards China also took the opportunity to attack the Chinese government, wanting to overthrow the Chinese government and cause chaos in China. This is completely the result of feudal consciousness and authoritarian remnants still lingering in their minds. When we see the governments of various industrialized countries, without considering the true facts, immediately announcing economic sanctions against China, stopping all diplomatic relations and technological exchanges, the speed of their response is unprecedented, showing the power of rumors.

The economic losses caused by this student movement to China are truly incalculable. However, the leaders of the student movement actually blackmailed the government into acknowledging that this student movement was a patriotic movement, which is insane and shows no remorse for the irreparable damage they caused to their country.

After the rumor campaign launched by the student movement's leaders and backers failed, they resorted to a desperate gambit, fabricating the Tiananmen Square massacre to shock international opinion and achieve their goal of destroying China's international position and domestic economic construction. In June, China experienced continuous incidents of murder, arson, and looting. Just in terms of burned vehicles, there were over 1,000, including public buses, trams, trucks, and military vehicles. They used the burned vehicles to block major roads in Beijing, preventing the PLA from entering Beijing to enforce martial law. They surrounded the troops that had entered Beijing, seizing soldiers' weapons and ammunition. They also captured soldiers, beat them to death, and hung their bodies on the railings of overpasses, burning them with gasoline. These horrifying scenes were captured by the staff of the three major American television broadcasting companies in Beijing. Of course, we cannot say that these scenes shown on television are propaganda or fabrication by the Chinese government.

On the morning of June 4, rumors spread that a massacre had occurred in Tiananmen Square. The student movement leaders reported that 30,000 students had been killed and countless people injured. Although the three major American television broadcasting companies had reporters and cameras in the square, they did not see any signs of a massacre. At that time, with the rumors of a massacre, they reported based on the rumors, and thus the massacre rumor became a fact. They reported the rumors as facts, which was certainly intentional. Otherwise, why did they not use footage to confirm the massacre?

Rational and fair-minded people in the United States reported in detail what they had witnessed in Beijing, pointing out that the so-called Tiananmen Square massacre had no factual basis and was merely a rumor.

The truth about the Tiananmen Square massacre has gradually become clear in American society. This is entirely due to a few rational and fair-minded American television special program hosts and columnists who reported in detail what they had witnessed on the night of June 3 and the morning of June 4, refuting the massacre rumor.

On the nights of June 3 and 4, Ted Roppel, the special host of ABC Television, recorded what he saw on his videotape and broadcast it at 10 PM on June 27 on the ABC Television network that covers the entire United States. He solemnly pointed out that the so-called massacre had no factual basis and was merely a rumor.

Following this, Jay Matthews, who was the chief of the Washington Post's Beijing bureau and is now the chief of the Los Angeles bureau, pointed out that there was no massacre that night. What he saw in June was on the Third Ring Road, where three young men on bicycles stopped a truck carrying food and supplies, set the truck on fire, and then shouted slogans and rode away on their bicycles. He also witnessed a group of young people surrounding PLA soldiers, seizing their rifles and ammunition. At the same time, he confirmed Ted Roppel's report that there were indeed incidents of dismembering soldiers' limbs. The so-called "peaceful petition" by students did not match the facts. These events were all witnessed by him.

We can refer to the A25 column in the June 29 issue of the Washington Post. On June 30, Sarah Lubman, the Washington Post's Beijing correspondent, also published her special report. According to her report, she was with the high-level leaders of the student movement from the beginning of the student movement and can be said to have been with the student movement from start to finish. She emphasized that this student movement had nothing to do with democracy, and elevating the student movement to a democratic movement was an insult to the word "democracy." Another columnist, Richard Harwood, also agreed with her conclusion. We can also refer to his article published in the editorial section of the Washington Post on July 2. When we see their reports of what they saw and heard in Tiananmen Square, it is undoubtedly indisputable or questionable. Then, why did the rumor spread and shock the whole world? The Washington Post's Beijing correspondent used the word "myth" to describe the so-called massacre rumor.

Although the editorial department of the Washington Post stirred up trouble, spread rumors, and distorted right and wrong during the student movement, condemning the Chinese government without mercy, this not only misled itself and others but also damaged the Washington Post's self-proclaimed reputation for integrity and impartiality. However, the bureau chief, columnist, and Beijing correspondent of the Post reported based on facts, refuting the absurd statements made by the Post during the student movement.

In the United States, although the truth about the Tiananmen Square massacre has been revealed to the world, some overseas Chinese in the United States still insist on being wrong to the end, running around and shouting to continue the rumor of the Tiananmen Square massacre. They organized the "All-American Chinese Association for Promoting Democracy," and some Chinese students in the United States also organized the "Alliance of Independent Student Unions." They declared to the world that their ultimate goal is to overthrow the current Chinese government by force and bring the current government leaders to justice. After overthrowing the Chinese government, they will establish a government ruled by intellectuals. This is completely the same as the feudal autocratic era in China, always using violence to change dynasties. They do not prioritize building democracy but want to establish a feudal political system ruled by intellectuals. This continuous turmoil not only hinders the development of Chinese culture but also destroys China's economic structure. This periodic great destruction has made China perpetually weak and vulnerable to foreign invasions.

Those who want to overthrow the Chinese government think that China's socialism has failed. In fact, they do not know that in 1929, when the United States experienced a serious crisis, President Roosevelt adopted socialist policies. To make China completely Westernized is to make China regress and perpetually fall behind.

Now, those who want to overthrow the Chinese government think that China's socialism has failed. Obviously, they do not know that capitalist America experienced a serious crisis in 1929, almost leading to self-destruction. At that time, the newly elected President Roosevelt established the New Deal, adopting socialist policies such as the social welfare system, national economic control, unemployment insurance, medical insurance, organizing the National Works Progress Administration, incorporating all unemployed people in the country into this structure, and starting to build national water conservancy irrigation systems. The most famous constructions include highways, the TVA hydroelectric system, the Grand Coulee hydroelectric system, national housing construction, government buildings, the restoration of bankrupt large enterprises and banks, river dredging, and national greening. Of course, there are still people in the United States today who oppose the socialization of capitalism. In 1980, the conservative Reagan was elected president, repeatedly vowing to abolish the New Deal and state enterprises left by Roosevelt's administration, but these New Deals and enterprises have become American law, and Reagan's efforts ultimately failed.

From these economic changes, we can see that capitalism not only does not meet the demands of the times but is also a dead-end road. Now, to make China follow the capitalist road is to prove that they do not know the lessons of history and practical experience. The so-called complete Westernization of China is merely to make China regress and perpetually fall behind.

Those who instigate riots never mention that China has a constitution based on democracy. China's constitution is a law that guarantees a democratic system, with a series of clearly defined maximum freedoms and human rights. Even the democratic government of the United States would never allow American students to run amok like China's student movement, destroying the American government. China's government's decisive action to suppress the riot is the execution of an inviolable responsibility.

This domestic student movement was originally a conspiracy: to overthrow the Chinese government through riots, using fabricated democracy and freedom to deceive the world. They never mention that China already has a constitution based on democracy. China's constitution is not only a law that guarantees a democratic system but also has a series of clearly defined maximum freedoms and human rights. We can say that China's constitution's interpretation of democracy is far broader than any democratic country. This time, China's student movement ran amok for eight weeks, trampling on democracy and freedom, truly exceeding any definition and scope of democracy and freedom.

Even the democratic government of the United States would not allow American students to run amok like China's student movement to destroy the American government. In 1969, the United States experienced a student movement against the Vietnam War, occupying campuses to protest, and the federal government, to maintain the government's dignity and social order, decisively sent troops to suppress the riot, and bloodshed occurred. Even former U.S. President Reagan, when he was the governor of California in 1969, deployed the National Guard to suppress the student movement. At that time, the American student movement was only against the U.S. Vietnam policy.

However, this time, China's student movement was a riot to overthrow the Chinese government. Faced with the serious situation, the Chinese government, of course, could not ignore it and let it develop naturally. The Chinese government's decisive action to suppress the riot is the execution of an inviolable responsibility. The government of any country in the world also has this inviolable responsibility: to send troops to suppress anti-government and anti-state rebellions.

　　在美国尚有理智公允的人士
　　陈嘉祐
    编者按：陈嘉祐教授是浙江杭州人，今年78岁，早年毕业于上海暨南大学，30年代去美国学习，1940年在印地安那州获法学博士学位，后在美国国防部国际关系研究院任研究员30多年，退休后到华盛顿霍华德大学任宪法教授。
    本文是陈教授提供给《瞭望》海外版发表的。该刊只是为方便于读者阅读，加了几个提要性的小标题。
    此次中国的学潮岂是民主运动！学潮的作风完全与民主背道而驰，不过是传统封建专制的再现，重复历史上的动乱来改朝换代。
    此次中国学潮与海外反华分子沆瀣一气，策动谣言攻势，初则以贪污的黑锅抛在中国政府身上，继而说中国政府是专制独裁，后又制造天安门广场大屠杀的谎言，真是山雨欲来，胁从了几十万之众，结集天安门广场达八星期之久，以达到摧毁中国在国际间的地位和国内经济的阴谋。
    学潮所策动的谣言亦不过是动乱的前奏。初则以贪污的黑锅抛在中国政府身上，贪污亦就成了政府的代名词；继而以“无自由毋宁死”的口号，将中国政府说成为专制独裁，夺去了人民的自由；再而三者，则以“绝食救亡”将中国现在执政的政府说成为灭亡中国的政府。这种谣言掩盖了事实的真相，和几千年来黄河泛滥成灾一样，淹没了无可计数的人民和经济文化中心所在的城镇和乡村，时到今日仍长埋于黄土之下，永远不能见天日。
    这次学潮所策动的谣言攻势，与海外反华分子沆瀣一气，借着现代电讯工具，谣言不胫而走，遍及整个世界。众口铄金，谣言亦就成了事实。当然，传播谣言是有他一定的目的和周详的计划的，一如同在秦亡之后，楚王项羽与汉王刘邦互争天下。
    公元前202年，垓下之战，项羽被围，久久不能解脱，真使他心乱如麻。那天夜间，楚歌从四面而来，项羽心惊胆战，以为他的军队军心已散，竟向刘邦投降；他的部下亦互相猜疑，弄得敌友不分。项羽不敢恋战，连夜突围，到了乌江仅剩30骑。正是前有乌江天堑，后有追兵，大势已去，不能挽狂澜于既倒，愧见江东父老。一代“力拔山兮气盖世”的枭雄，竟走投无路，自刎而亡。垓下决战是刘邦事先决策的以毁灭项羽为目的，以四面楚歌为手段，来动摇项羽战志的谣言攻势的成功。这在中国的历史上是首次记载的心理战中成功的谣言攻势。
    此次学潮所策动的谣言攻势，真是山雨欲来，声势浩大，胁从了几十万之众，结集在北京天安门广场不退达八个星期之久，可知谣言攻势所能起的作用。此次学潮以中间突破来捣毁中国政府，提出要以瓦解政府的条件为目的，以坚持霸占天安门广场不退为手段，来要挟政府，以逞中间突破。于是学潮缩小打击的范围，将焦点集中在政府领导人员身上，传播政府领导人员已将国家的黄金贮备私自运出国外，以作逃亡国外后维持享乐生活之用；宣布邓小平已死亡，杨尚昆已逃遁无踪，李鹏被卫士行刺，身中四枪，生死不明；中国中央政府所在地中南海，已有3处发生大火，仍在继续焚烧中；第27军已在北京郊区南苑被其它部队包围，正在激战中，内战形势已成；各地区政府亦纷纷宣告独立，中国已沦陷在无政府的状态中，等等。
    在美国极具权威性的《纽约时报》和《华盛顿邮报》居然恢复了过去竞载黄色新闻的故伎，不计报道的准确性，尽量将传闻的谣言说成为极无疑问的可靠消息，大肆渲染，以大字标题登载在报章的首版。一些专栏作家亦竞作专题论文，来攻击中国政府，将学潮抬高，说成为争取民主的运动。但是这些基于谣言的片面之辞，经不起时间的考验，先后宣告破产；可是他们仍不承认失败，仍是一贯反华，始终与中国为敌，在海外的一些对中国原来存有敌意的华人，亦借机来攻击中国政府，既要打倒中国政府，又要中国大乱。这完全是封建意识和专制余毒仍在他们心理上作祟的结果。当我们看了各工业先进国家的政府，不计事实的真相，人云亦云，立即宣布对中国实施经济制裁，停止一切外交关系和科技交流，反应之迅速，史无前例，可见谣言作用之大。
    这次学潮对中国的经济损失，真是不能以金钱来计算。但是这些学潮的领导人居然要挟政府承认这次学潮是爱国运动，真是丧心病狂，不知他们对祖国所造成无可挽救的严重破坏。
    在学潮领导人和背后策动人所制造的谣言攻势破产后，他们便不惜孤注一掷，制造出天安门广场大屠杀的谣言，来耸动国际视听，达到摧毁中国在国际间的地位和国内的经济建设的阴谋。6月间，在中国连续发生了杀人、焚烧、抢劫等罪行。以烧毁的车辆一项来讲就有1000多辆。包括公共汽车、电车、货车和军车。并将烧毁的车辆在北京各交通要道，筑起了路障，来阻止执行戒严令的解放军进入北京。将已进入北京的军队层层包围，抢夺兵士的枪械和弹药。还将捉获的兵士活活打死，再将尸体吊在立交桥的栏杆上，用汽油焚烧。这些可怖的电视录像是美国三大电视广播公司人员在北京现场所采访到的实况。当然，我们不能说这些在电视荧屏上所展出的情节是中国政府的宣传或是造谣。
    在6月4日晨，谣言纷飞，说天安门广场已发生大屠杀。学潮领导人报道已有3万学生被杀，和不可计数的人受伤。虽然美国三大电视广播公司都有报告和录像人员在广场，但是他们全没有看到有大屠杀的痕迹。当时既有大屠杀的谣言，他们就根据谣言来传播，于是大屠杀的谣言亦就成为事实。他们将谣言当事实来报道，当然是有用意的。不然的话，为甚么他们对于大屠杀没有用录像来证实确有其事？
  美国有理智和公允的人士，将他们在北京目睹的实况作了详尽的报道，指出所谓的天安门广场大屠杀没有事实根据，不过是谣言。
    美国社会对于天安门广场大屠杀的真相已日渐明朗。这完全是由于几位有理智和公允的美国电视特别节目主持人和专栏作家，将他们在6月3日夜间和6月4日早晨亲眼目睹的实况作了详尽的报道，否定了大屠杀的谣言。
    美国ABC电视广播公司电视特别主持人Ted　Roppel在6月3、4两日间，将所见的情况摄入在他的录像带中，在6月27日晚上十点钟，在ABC电视广播公司所属的普及全美的电视台放映。他特别郑重指出，所谓大屠杀一事没有事实的根据，不过是谣言。
    接着，有《华盛顿邮报》曾任驻北京的新闻分社主持人，现任美国洛杉矶新闻分社主持人Jey　Mathews指出，在当晚现场并没有发生大屠杀一事。他在6月间所看到的却是在三环路上，有三个乘自行车的青年阻止了一辆载食粮和杂货的货车，并一把火将这辆货车烧毁后，高喊口号，骑着自行车扬长而去。他又亲眼看到一批年轻人包围着解放军的兵士，抢夺了他们的步枪和弹药。同时他也证实了Ted　Roppel的报道，确有肢解兵士手脚的事发生，所谓的学生“和平请愿”与事实不符，这些事，都是他亲眼目睹的。
    我们可以参考在6月29日出版的《华盛顿邮报》A25号专栏，在6月30日，《华盛顿邮报》驻北京记者Sarab　Lubman也登载了她的专题报告。根据她的报道，在学潮开始时，她就和学潮高层领导人在一起，可以说和学潮相始终。她强调指出，这次学潮完全没有民主，将学潮抬高为民主运动简直是对民主一词的侮辱。另外一位Richard　Harwood亦是《华盛顿邮报》的专题作家，他完全同意她的结论。我们还可以参考他在7月2日出版的《华盛顿邮报》社论栏中所发表的论文。我们看了他们报道在天安门广场上所见所闻的事，当然是不容置辩或是置疑。那么，为什么谣言会流传到震惊了整个世界呢？那位《华盛顿邮报》驻北京的记者，就用“神话”一词来形容这次所谓的大屠杀的谣言。
    虽然《华盛顿邮报》的编辑部在学潮期间，兴风作浪，造谣生事，颠倒是非，谴责中国政府不遗余力，这不但自误误人，也有损《华盛顿邮报》自命正直无私的信誉。但是，《邮报》自己的分社社长、专栏作家和驻北京的记者却根据事实来报道，否定了《邮报》在学潮期间所作出的荒诞言论。
    在美国，虽然天安门广场大屠杀的真相已大白于世，但是在美国的一些华人仍是坚持错到底的心态，奔走呼号，要继续鼓噪天安门广场大屠杀的谣言，组织了“全美华人促进民主会”，一些中国在美国的留学生也组织了“独立学生会的联盟”。他们宣告世界：要以暴力来摧毁现在执政的中国政府为最后目的，并要将现在的政府领导人绳之以法。在摧毁中国政府后，另组以知识分子专政的政府。这完全和中国封建专制时代一样，总要以暴力来换朝易代。他们不以建设民主为当务之急，反而要建立以知识分子专政的封建政制。这种暴乱相继，不但阻止了中国文化的发扬，而且销毁了中国的经济结构。这种周期性的大毁灭，使中国一贯贫弱和招致外来侵略。
    那些要摧毁中国政府，以为中国的社会主义已告失败的人，其实他们不知道，美国在1929年发生严重危机时，罗斯福总统就采取了社会主义政策。要中国全部西化是要中国开倒车和永远落后。
    现在那些要摧毁中国政府的人，以为中国的社会主义已告失败。很显然，他们不知道资本主义的美国在1929年曾发生严重的危机，几有自告毁灭的结局。当时新任总统罗斯福创立新政，采取社会主义的政策，如社会福利制度、全国经济统制、失业保证、医药保险，组织全国工程建设机构，将全国失业者全部纳入这一结构，开始兴建全国性的水利灌溉系统。其中最著名的建设如公路、TVA水力发电系统、Grand　Conlee水力发电系统、全国住房建设、政府大厦的兴建、恢复已告破产的大企业和银行、清理河道、绿化全国等。当然，美国到今日仍有反对资本主义社会主义化的人士。1980年，保守主义的里根当选为总统，口口声声要废除罗斯福总统时代所遗留下的新政和国家企业，但是这些新政和企业已成为美国的法律，里根的努力终告失败。
    看了这些经济的变革，就可知道资本主义不但已不适应时代的要求，而且是走不通的道路。现在要中国走资本主义的道路，足证明他们不知历史的教训和实践的经验。所谓要中国全部西化，亦不过是要中国开倒车和永远落后。
    搞暴乱的人始终不提中国有基于民主的宪法。中国的宪法是保证民主政制的法律，具有一系列明文规定的极大限度的自由和人权。就是民主的美国政府也决不会放任美国的学生像中国的学潮那样无法无天，摧毁美国政府。中国政府断然出兵平乱是执行不可侵犯的责任。
    此次国内的学潮原来就是个阴谋：以暴动来摧毁中国的政府，以虚构的民主和自由为掩护来欺骗世人。他们始终不提中国已有基于民主的宪法。中国的宪法不但是保证民主政制的法律，而且具有一系列明文规定的极大限度的自由和人权。我们可以说，中国宪法对于民主的解说，比任何民主国家远要广泛。这次中国的学潮无法无天动乱了8个星期之久，践踏了民主和自由，真是超越了任何民主和自由的定义和范畴。
    就是民主的美国政府，亦决不会放任美国的学生发展到像中国学潮那样无法无天地搞动乱，也不会容忍像中国学潮那样要摧毁美国的政府。在1969年，美国发生了反对越南战争的学生运动，霸占校园以示抗议，美国联邦政府为了维护政府的威信和社会的治安，断言出兵平乱，而且发生了流血的惨事。就是前任美国总统里根，在1969年任加利福尼亚州长时也出动民卫兵，摧毁了学生运动。当时美国的学生运动不过是反对美国的越南政策。
    但是这次中国的学潮是以暴动来摧毁中国的政府。中国政府鉴于事态的严重，当然不能置之不问不闻，任其自然发展。中国政府断然出兵平乱就是执行不可侵犯的责任。世界任何国家的政府亦有此不可侵犯的责任：出动军队来镇压颠覆政府和反国家的叛乱。
