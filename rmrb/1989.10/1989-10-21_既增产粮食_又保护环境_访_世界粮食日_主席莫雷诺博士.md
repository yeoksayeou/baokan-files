	Increasing Food Production and Protecting the Environment
	— An Interview with Dr. Rafael Moreno, Chairman of World Food Day

	By Luo Jinbiao, People’s Daily Reporter

	October 16th is World Food Day. This year’s theme is “Food and the Environment.” The reporter interviewed Dr. Rafael Moreno, Deputy Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and Chairman of World Food Day, on this topic.

	Why was the theme of this year’s World Food Day chosen to be “Food and the Environment”? Dr. Moreno said that the need to increase food production while protecting the Earth’s resources and environment is a very real problem facing the world today.

	Increasing Pressure on Food Demand

	Dr. Moreno said that the Earth’s surface area has not changed, but the number of people living on it is increasing at an astonishing rate. In 1988, the world’s population reached 5 billion, double that of 1950. By the year 2000, it will exceed 6 billion. Currently, 75% of the world’s population lives in the Third World. It is here that the problems of population growth, food production and distribution, and deteriorating natural environments are intertwined and becoming increasingly severe. According to the FAO’s fifth global food survey, between 1979 and 1981, at least 495 million people suffered from food shortages. Even though in the past 10 years the overall growth rate of food production has been faster than the population growth rate, the uneven distribution has still resulted in an increase in the number of people suffering from food shortages. All inhabitants of the Earth rely on this planet for their food. To maintain the current level of food consumption by the year 2000, food production needs to increase by about 40%. To eliminate hunger, even more food needs to be produced. All of this means that the demand for food is putting increasing pressure on the Earth’s natural resources.

	Severe Deterioration of the Earth’s Environment

	Dr. Moreno pointed out that the Earth’s environment, including land, water, and air, has already been severely degraded due to human activities.

	Firstly, this situation is caused by industrialization in developed countries. During the process of industrialization, the Earth’s natural resources have been plundered, land, lakes, and oceans have been polluted by garbage and toxic waste, and the air is filled with toxic gases. Acid rain is threatening forests and lakes. The “greenhouse effect” caused by carbon dioxide and other gases may significantly raise the Earth’s temperature, leading to major climate changes. The ozone layer is being damaged, which may cause serious harm to humans and plants worldwide.

	Secondly, poverty and population pressure in Third World countries are also causing environmental degradation.

	Every year, at least 11 million hectares of tropical forests are cut down, mainly due to poor farmers seeking arable land and pasture, as well as fuel. This has led to devastating consequences in many regions: in the Andes Mountains, such an important hydrological basin, vegetation has almost been stripped bare, land has been eroded, and the danger and harm of floods have increased. Plants along the coasts of Africa and Asia have been severely damaged.

	Due to land degradation, arable land will be significantly reduced. FAO research shows that the world loses 50 to 70 million hectares of arable land each year, most of which occurs in developing countries.

	Arid and semi-arid regions are threatened by the encroachment of deserts. According to United Nations research, desertification has destroyed 27 million hectares of irrigated land, 173 million hectares of rain-fed land, and 307.1 million hectares of pasture. In Brazil, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia, more and more regions are threatened by desertification.

	Most of the world’s aquatic resources are also facing serious dangers. From the 1950s to the 1960s, the world’s fish catch increased by about 7% per year; since 1970, the growth rate has slowed to about 2%. In many regions, freshwater aquaculture is also threatened by river and lake pollution, as well as water use by cities and industries.

	The Key Lies in Rural Development

	Dr. Moreno believes that in the face of the severe challenges posed by food production and environmental protection, we should not be pessimistic but should believe in human capability. We should find ways to produce more food without degrading the land, raise more livestock without turning pastures into deserts, and develop fisheries without depleting aquatic resources.

	At the same time, we must strive to ensure that hundreds of millions of impoverished farmers around the world no longer suffer from poverty. All countries, whether developed or developing, must take immediate action. The technical, economic, political, and social sectors, as well as the environmental protection sector, must coordinate and work together. Here, the key lies in rural development. Many countries, such as China, have made tremendous efforts in this regard, creating valuable experiences that show there is a feasible path. We hope that more countries will do the same and believe that governments of all countries can find solutions.

　　既增产粮食　又保护环境
　　——访“世界粮食日”主席莫雷诺博士
　　本报记者　罗晋标
    10月16日，是一年一度的“世界粮食日”。今年的主题为“粮食与环境”。记者就此采访了联合国粮农组织副总干事、“世界粮食日”主席拉法尔·莫雷诺博士。
    为什么今年的“世界粮食日”要选择“粮食与环境”这一主题呢？莫雷诺博士表示，既要增产粮食，又要保护地球资源和环境，这是当今世界面临的一个极为现实的问题。
    粮食需求压力增大
    莫雷诺博士说，地球的面积并没有变，但生活在地球上的人数却以惊人速度增加。1988年世界人口达50亿，为1950年的两倍；到2000年，将超过60亿人。目前世界3／4的人生活在第三世界。正是在这里，人口的增加、粮食的生产和分配与自然环境不断恶化等问题交织在一起，日益严重。据粮农组织第5次世界粮食调查，在1979年至1981年，至少有4.95亿人粮食不足。即使最近10年整个粮食生产的增长速度比人口增长速度快，但分配不均仍造成了粮食不足者总数的增加。地球上的所有居民都要从这个地球获取粮食。如要保证2000年能维持现有粮食消费水平，粮食生产要增加40％左右，而要消灭饥饿则需增产更多。这一切意味着粮食需求对地球自然资源的压力越来越大。
    地球环境严重恶化
    莫雷诺博士指出，地球环境，包括土地、水和空气等，由于人类活动已经出现了严重恶化的情况。
    首先，这种情况是发达国家工业化所造成的。在工业化过程中，地球自然资源被掠夺，土地、湖泊和海洋被垃圾和有毒废料污染，空气充满有毒气体。酸雨威胁着森林和湖泊。二氧化碳和其他气体造成的“温室效应”可能使整个地球温度明显上升，引起气候大变化。臭氧层遭破坏，可能造成对全球人类和动植物的严重危害。
    其次，第三世界国家的贫困和人口压力也造成了环境恶化。
    地球上每年至少有1100万顷热带森林被砍伐，这主要是由于贫苦农民为争耕地和牧场以及为获取燃料。这在许多地区造成了破坏性恶果：安第斯山那样极为重要的水文盆地，植被几乎被剥光，土地被侵蚀，水灾的危险和危害增加。沿非洲和亚洲海岸的植物遭到严重破坏。
    由于土地遭破坏，耕地将大量减少。粮农组织的研究表明，全世界每年要失去500至700万顷耕地，其中大部分发生在发展中国家。
    干旱和半干旱地区受到沙漠推进的威胁。据联合国研究结果，沙漠化破坏了2700万顷水浇地、17300万顷雨浇地、307100万顷牧场。在巴西、孟加拉国、巴基斯坦、阿富汗、伊朗、阿尔及利亚、利比亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯，越来越多的地区遭受沙漠化的威胁。
    地球上大部分地区的水产资源也面临着严重危险。50年代至60年代期间，世界捕鱼量每年增长约7％；1970年以来，增长速度降低到约2％。在许多地区，淡水养鱼也遭受河湖污染、城市和工农业用水的威胁。
    关键在于发展农村
    莫雷诺博士认为，面对上述有关粮食生产和环境保护问题的严重挑战，我们不应当悲观，而要相信人类的能力。我们应当找到这样的办法：生产更多粮食而不使土地贫瘠，饲养更多牲畜而不使牧场变为干旱地，发展渔业而不至剥夺水产资源。
    同时，我们必须努力保证全世界数以亿计的贫苦农民不再继续遭受贫困。所有国家，无论是发达国家还是发展中国家，都要紧急行动起来，技术、经济、政治、社会各部门同环境保护部门相互协调，作出一致努力。在这里，关键在于发展农村。不少国家，例如中国，在这方面作出了巨大努力，创造了具有巨大价值的经验，它表明有一条切实可行的道路。我们希望有更多的国家能这样做，并相信各国政府能够找到解决办法。
