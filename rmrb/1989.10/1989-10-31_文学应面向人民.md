For some time, the Chinese literary world has been bustling with its own affairs while being largely ignored by society. On one hand, various schools and factions are flourishing, while on the other, society seems indifferent to these phenomena. Many works, apart from editors and a few literary circles, have no readers and are left to perish on their own. This cannot be said to align with the original intentions of the writers. Meanwhile, in the literary field that serious writers disregard, a "yellow tide" is surging, and various poorly made cultural trash not only takes away millions of readers from serious literature but also seriously corrupts social morals. The tragedy of literature should make us reflect deeply. The Muse cannot continue to "boldly march forward" alone but should look back to see how far she has strayed from the common people.

"Soul, return!"

Looking at the development history of Chinese modern literature, allowing literature to move from the "palace" to the "common people" is one of the goals and a fine tradition of the promoters of modern literature.

At the beginning of modern Chinese literature, the pioneers of the May Fourth New Culture Movement raised the banner of "literary revolution" and issued a resounding challenge to feudal literature. In his famous "On Literary Revolution," Chen Duxiu clearly proposed the "three major principles": "To overthrow the ornate and flattering aristocratic literature and build a plain and lyrical national literature; to overthrow the stale and extravagant classical literature and build a fresh and sincere realistic literature; to overthrow the obscure and abstruse literature of the woods and build a clear and popular social literature."

These "three major principles" essentially aim to remove all barriers between literature and the people, making literature close to life and approach the people, and together with the people, break with feudal culture. Although the May Fourth cultural pioneers' advocacy of "literary revolution" was somewhat vague in purpose and radical in attitude, and some views were inevitably biased, their advocacy of literature facing the people still has great significance today. After the "literary revolution" slogan was raised, a group of literary revolutionaries, with their everlasting works, shouted out the strongest voice of the times. Whether it was Lu Xun's cry of "Save the children" in "Diary of a Madman" or Guo Moruo's passionate call for a brand-new China in "The Phoenix's Rebirth," they both shook the entire China at that time. Later, with the advocacy of revolutionary literature and the rise of the proletarian literary movement, literature further approached the masses. After the Yan'an rectification of literature and art, Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks" pointed out the direction for the development of proletarian revolutionary literature, and Chinese modern literature saw an unprecedented situation. Literature was more closely integrated with the times and the people, thus forming a new wave of new democratic literature that has made indelible contributions to the history of the Chinese revolution.

In the past decade of the new period, under the guidance of the Party's pragmatic line of thought, the literary and art circles have returned to their roots and brought new vitality to literature. However, the recurrent bourgeois liberalization trend has harmed the healthy development of our country's literature. Various serious literary trends that are far removed from life and the people, and various strange, bizarre, and obscure works, have entered the hall under various grand and fashionable banners. Once a writer's life and creation go astray, they will inevitably drift further from the people and ultimately be abandoned by the people. In recent years, the sharp decline in the circulation of serious literary magazines in our country has already sounded the alarm for writers. Only by facing the people can literature fulfill its glorious mission of socialist literature. Socialist literature has a sacred mission, that is, to enrich the spiritual life of the people with healthy spiritual products, to purify people's moral character, and to inspire the people to build a better life. The mission of socialist literature requires writers in the socialist period to have a high sense of social responsibility.

This sense of responsibility is reflected in: first, never allowing one's works to harm society; second, writers should, through various lively and popular forms that the people like, promote social virtues and righteousness, and promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

Only by facing the people can literature have the fundamental guarantee of prosperity. The people are the mother of all excellent writers; the people's life is the soil on which all excellent works are based. Therefore, to make the tree of literature deep-rooted and luxuriant, literature must face the people.

Facing the people requires writers to face the people, that is, they should put down their airs, deeply feel the labor and creation of the people, feel the spirit of the people in the construction of socialist modernization, feel the various psychological and spiritual phenomena they produce under new historical conditions, and feel the great strides of China's modernization process. If a writer is separated from the lively creation of the people, separated from the optimistic and enterprising life of the people in the face of difficulties, and only faces himself, closes the door to create, and even distorts and defames the historical appearance of the people's life, he will inevitably be abandoned by the people.

Facing the people also requires writers to use healthy literary works to guide the people to strive for the construction of a prosperous and democratic socialist republic. Literary works should be the spiritual fire of an era, especially so in the socialist historical period. Those works that depict the socialist life, which the people have obtained through bloody struggles, as a piece of blackness, those that spread negative, decadent, and even desperate emotions with so-called "anxiety consciousness," those that dilute the era, dilute the plot, and dilute the characters to the point where only a blur remains, and those that are permeated with bourgeois liberalization and are incompatible with socialist spiritual civilization, can only bring confusion, bewilderment, and even despair to the people. In recent years, the literary field has forgotten "grandeur." We should fulfill our duty as writers, for the people, for the nation, and call for the "grand soul."

Of course, our society is not flawless, especially a socialist republic built on the ruins of a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society. In a relatively long historical period, it is inevitable that it will bear the birthmarks of the old society. Various negative phenomena, even dark sides, in socialist society, our writers are not forbidden to write, but we must not exaggerate ants into elephants and clouds into dark clouds. Because of some negative phenomena in the socialist motherland, we should not deny her entirely, which the people will not accept.

　　文学应面向人民
　　于吉瑞
    一个时期以来，中国文坛自身的热闹与在整个社会中的被冷落，正形成强烈的反差。一方面是各种主义流派旗帜林立，另一方面是社会对这种现象的视而不见。许多作品，除编辑及少数文学圈子里的人以外，没有读者，一任自生自灭。这不能说不是违背了文学家们的初衷。而在为严肃作家不屑一顾的另一文场上，“黄潮”汹涌，各种粗制滥造的文化垃圾不仅夺去了严肃文学的千百万读者，而且严重地污染了社会风气。文学的悲哀，应引起我们沉痛的反思。缪斯女神，不能再独自“大胆地往前走”了，而应回眸身后，看看自己究竟离红尘间的芸芸众生有多远了。
  “魂兮归来！”
    从中国新文学的发展史来看，让文学从“殿堂”走向“民间”，是新文学倡导者们的目标之一，也是新文学的优良传统之一。
    中国现代文学肇始之初，“五·四”新文化的先驱们就高扬“文学革命”之旗，对封建文学提出了响亮的挑战。陈独秀在他著名的《文学革命论》中，明确提出“三大主义”：“曰推倒雕琢的阿谀的贵族文学，建设平易的抒情的国民文学；曰推倒陈腐的铺张的古典文学，建设新鲜的立诚的写实文学；曰推倒迂晦的艰涩的山林文学，建设明了的通俗的社会文学”。
    这“三大主义”实质上是推倒文学与人民之间的一切壁垒，让文学贴近生活，向人民靠拢，与人民一道，同封建文化决裂。尽管“五·四”文化先驱们倡导“文学革命”目的是朦胧的，态度是激进的，有些看法难免偏颇，但他们倡导文学面向人民，现在看来，仍有非常重大的意义。“文学革命”的口号喊出之后，一批文学革命的先驱，以自己彪炳千秋的作品，喊出了时代的最强音。不论是鲁迅在《狂人日记》中发出的“救救孩子”的呐喊，还是郭沫若在《凤凰涅槃》中对一个崭新中国的热情呼唤，都震动了当时整个中国。后来，随着革命文学的倡导和无产阶级文学运动的兴起，文学更进一步地走向民众。延安文艺整风以后，毛泽东同志的《讲话》给无产阶级革命文学的发展指明了方向，中国新文学出现了前所未有的局面。文学与时代与人民结合得更紧了，从而形成了在中国革命史册上立下不可磨灭功绩的新民主主义文学新潮。
    新时期十年来，在党的实事求是的思想路线指引下，文艺界正本清源，给文学带来新的生机。但不时泛滥的资产阶级自由化思潮，却使我国的文学健康发展受到损害。各种严重脱离生活，脱离人民的文艺思潮，各种怪异、猎奇、晦涩的作品，在各种堂皇、时髦的旗帜下，登堂入室。作家的生活和创作一旦走火入魔，必然离人民越来越远，最终必然要被人民所抛弃。最近几年我国严肃文学刊物发行量的急骤下降，就早已向作家们敲响了警钟。文学面向人民，才能不负于社会主义文学的光荣使命。社会主义文学负有神圣的使命，即用健康的精神产品，来丰富人民群众的精神生活，净化人们的道德情操，鼓舞人民建设美好生活的勇气。社会主义文学的使命要求社会主义时期的作家们要有高度的社会责任感。
    这种责任感表现在：一、决不能让自己的作品有害于社会，二、相反，作家应通过各种生动活泼的为人民群众所喜闻乐见的形式，弘扬社会美德和正气，促进社会主义精神文明的建设。
    文学面向人民，才使文学有了繁荣的根本保障。人民，是一切优秀作家的母亲；人民的生活，是一切优秀作品赖以产生的土壤。因此，要想使文学之树根深叶茂，文学必须面向人民。
    文学面向人民，就是要求作家们面向人民，即应当放下架子，深刻感受人民劳动创造的生活，感受人民群众在社会主义现代化建设中的精神风貌，感受他们在新的历史条件下所产生的各种心理现象和精神现象，感受中国现代化历史进程的伟大步伐。作家如果离开了人民群众生龙活虎的创造，离开了人民群众在困难中乐观奋进的时代生活，一味面向自我，闭门造车，甚至歪曲、丑化人民生活的历史面貌，势必被人民所抛弃。
    文学面向人民，还要求作家们用健康的文学作品，引导人民为建设富裕、民主的社会主义共和国而奋斗。文学作品，应是一个时代的精神之火，在社会主义历史时期内，尤应如此。那些把人民经过浴血奋斗而换来的社会主义生活涂抹得一片漆黑的作品，那些以不正常的所谓“忧患意识”来传播消极、颓废、甚至绝望情绪的作品，那些淡化时代、淡化情节、淡化人物到最后只剩下一片模糊的作品，那些渗透资产阶级自由化而与社会主义精神文明格格不入的作品，只能给人民带来迷惘、困惑甚至绝望。近几年，文学领域，“崇高”被淡忘了。我们应尽一个作家的义务，为人民，为民族召唤“崇高”之魂。
    当然，我们的社会不是美无瑕疵的，特别是像我们这样一个在半封建、半殖民地的废墟上建设起来的社会主义共和国，在相当长的一段历史时期内，她不可避免地会带有旧社会留给她的胎痕。社会主义社会中的各种消极现象、甚至阴暗面，我们的作家不是不能写，但决不应把蚂蚁说成大象，把云霓写成乌云。因为社会主义的祖国有些消极的现象而全盘否定她，是人民所不答应的。
