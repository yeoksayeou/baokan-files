It is well known that severe inflation, characterized by consumption and investment inflation, has become a major enemy in China's current economic life. In terms of consumption inflation, implementing "consumption diversion" is a necessary strategy to effectively control consumption inflation.

The core of guiding consumption diversion is to convert part of the consumption fund into production funds, thereby enhancing supply capacity.

Diversion One: Take effective measures to significantly increase residents' savings and defer and break down overheated consumption. Currently, Chinese residents hold more than 15 billion yuan in cash. If one-third of this can be converted into savings deposits, it will greatly weaken the momentum of consumption inflation and also expand the funding sources for increasing supply.

Diversion Two: Expand the issuance of stocks and bonds, converting part of the consumption funds into production funds. Allow some enterprises with good economic performance and promising products to issue a certain number of stocks and bonds, which can alleviate the pressure of cash in the hands of the public on the market at any time. At the same time, these production funds converted in the form of stocks and bonds can significantly increase effective supply.

Diversion Three: Accelerate the commercialization of housing, adjusting the structure of consumption fund usage. Currently, the consumption structure of Chinese residents is quite irrational, with a narrow consumption scope, mainly concentrated on food, clothing, daily necessities, and transportation, accounting for 92%, while consumption on housing only accounts for 8%. Currently, China has about 1.2 billion square meters of state-owned housing that can be sold. If half of this can be commercialized within three years, with an average selling price of 300 yuan per square meter, it can recover 180 billion yuan in consumption funds.

The above are strategies for consumption diversion in response to the already existing consumption fund inflation. Currently, it is necessary to strictly control the growth rate of consumption funds; reasonably adjust the product structure, enterprise structure, commodity structure, and investment structure to increase the supply of short-term consumer goods that are in demand; appropriately raise the prices of some consumer goods to curb excessive consumption demand; significantly reduce the scale of fixed asset investment; and strive to control the prices of production materials. Only by taking corresponding measures in all aspects and coordinating them can consumption inflation be truly effectively controlled and eliminated, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of curbing inflation.

    消费分流
    ——一个抑制消费膨胀的有效对策
    众所周知，以消费膨胀和投资膨胀为特征的严重通货膨胀已经成为我国当前经济生活中的大敌。就消费膨胀而论，实施“消费分流”是有效抑控消费膨胀必须采用的对策之一。
    引导消费分流的核心是把一部分消费基金转化为生产基金，增强供给能力。
    分流之一：采取有力措施大力增加居民储蓄，推迟和分解过热的消费。目前，我国居民手持现金1500亿元以上，若能将其中的1／3变为储蓄存款，将大大削弱消费膨胀的势头，也为增加供给扩大了资金来源。
    分流之二：扩大发行股票和债券，将部分消费基金转化为生产基金。允许一些经济效益好和产品有发展前途的企业，发行一定数量的股票和债券，那就能缓解群众手里的现金对市场随时产生的冲击和压力。与此同时，这些以股票和债券形式转化的生产基金可大大增加有效供给。
    分流之三：加快住宅商品化的步伐，调整消费基金的使用结构。目前我国居民的消费结构极不合理，消费面比较狭窄，消费主要集中在吃、穿、用、行上，占92％，而消费在住上仅占8％。目前，我国公有可出售住宅约12亿平方米，若能在三年内将其中一半商品化，以平均每平方米300元的售价计算，可收回消费基金1800亿元。
    以上是对已出现的消费基金膨胀采取消费分流的对策。当前，要严格控制消费基金的增长速度；合理调整产品结构、企业结构、商品结构和投资结构，增加适销对路的短线消费品的供给；还可适当调高部分消费品的价格，以遏制过旺的消费需求；要大幅度压缩固定资产投资规模；努力控制住生产资料价格。只有多方面都采取相应措施，彼此配合，才能真正有效地控制和消除消费膨胀，进而达到遏制通货膨胀的最终目的。
