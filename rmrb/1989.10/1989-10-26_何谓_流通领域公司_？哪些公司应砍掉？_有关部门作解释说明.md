	What is a "Circulation Sector Company"? Which Companies Should Be Eliminated?
	Relevant Departments Provide Explanations and Clarifications

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th – (Reporter Chen Yun)

	At today's national conference on the rectification and streamlining of companies, relevant departments explained and clarified what constitutes a circulation sector company and which companies in the circulation sector should be prioritized for elimination.

	The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Further Rectification and Streamlining of Companies" clearly states that the focus of company mergers and eliminations should be on "eliminating companies established by party and government organs at all levels, as well as companies in the circulation sector that are excessively involved in commercial wholesale, foreign trade, and material supply, and financial companies."

	Regarding companies in the circulation sector, relevant departments explained that circulation refers to the circulation of commodities, which is the exchange of commodities mediated by money. Companies in the circulation sector are those engaged in commodity buying and selling activities. Money, as a general equivalent, is a special commodity, so companies engaged in trust investments and other financial activities are also considered circulation sector companies.

	However, companies that produce and sell their own products should be classified as production-type companies; companies that engage in technological development and sell their own technologically developed products should be classified as technology-type companies; companies that both construct and sell their own constructed houses should be classified as construction industry companies. These three types of companies are not considered circulation sector companies. If the above companies sell very few of their own produced or developed products and mainly deal in other enterprises' products, they should be rectified as circulation sector companies. It is reported that this rectification and streamlining will focus on eliminating excessive and redundant companies in the circulation sector, specifically those engaged in wholesale business. These companies include:

	1. Commercial wholesale companies engaged in commodity buying and selling activities, including:
		- Wholesale companies within the state-owned commercial system;
		- Wholesale companies within the state-owned grain system that handle grain and oil purchasing and selling;
		- Wholesale companies at various levels within the supply and marketing cooperative system;
		- Various types of commercial wholesale companies established by production enterprises and various levels of production management departments;
		- Private enterprises engaged in commercial wholesale business.

	2. Material supply and sales companies, including:
		- Companies under material departments that handle material supply and sales;
		- Companies under provincial, autonomous region, and municipal material departments;
		- Material supply and sales companies under various levels of industrial and transportation management departments;
		- Material supply and sales companies under local township and enterprise management departments;
		- Companies commissioned by material management departments to handle the supply of important production materials;
		- Material exchange companies established by local economic cooperation offices;
		- Material supply and sales companies under large enterprises and enterprise groups.

	3. Foreign economic and trade companies, including:
		- Specialized foreign trade companies under the foreign economic and trade department that handle import and export business;
		- Specialized foreign trade companies under various levels of governments, departments, mass organizations, social groups, and military units;
		- Industrial-trade, agricultural-trade, technological-trade, military-trade companies, barter trade companies, small-scale border trade companies, comprehensive foreign trade companies, and foreign trade consulting service companies with foreign trade operation rights.

	4. Real estate development companies, including:
		- Companies within real estate enterprises that do not directly engage in the development and construction of real estate products but are solely engaged in the buying, selling, and leasing of houses and land.

　　何谓“流通领域公司”？哪些公司应砍掉？
　　有关部门作解释说明
    新华社北京10月25日电　（记者陈芸）在今天召开的全国清理整顿公司工作座谈会上，有关部门对什么是流通领域的公司和重点砍掉流通领域中哪些公司，作出解释及说明。
    中共中央、国务院《关于进一步清理整顿公司的决定》中明确提出，撤并公司的“重点是砍掉各级党政机关开办的公司，流通领域中过多、过滥的从事商业批发、对外贸易、物资供应的公司和金融性公司”。
    关于流通领域中的公司，有关部门解释说，流通是指商品流通，即以货币为媒介的商品交换。流通领域的公司，就是从事商品购销活动的公司。货币是充当一般等价物的特殊商品，因而从事信托投资等业务的金融性公司，也属流通领域公司。
    但是，从事商品生产并销售自己生产的商品的公司，应列为生产型公司；从事科技开发并销售自己科技开发商品的公司，应列为科技型公司；既建造房屋又出售自己建造的房屋的公司，应列为建筑业的公司，这三类公司不列为流通领域的公司。如果上述公司销售自己生产、开发的商品很少，主要经营其他企业的商品，则应按流通领域的公司进行整顿。据介绍，这次清理整顿要砍掉的流通领域中过多过滥的公司，是那些经营批发业务的公司，这类公司包括：
    一、从事商品购销活动的商业批发公司，包括：国营商业系统的批发公司；国营粮食系统中从事粮油购销的批发公司；供销合作社系统所属的各级批发公司；生产企业及各级生产主管部门开办的各类商业批发公司；私营企业中从事商业批发业务的公司。
    二、物资供销公司，包括：物资部门所属从事物资供应、销售等公司；省、自治区、直辖市各级物资部门所属公司；各级有关工业、交通主管部门所属物资供销公司；各地方乡镇企业主管部门所属物资供销公司以及受物资主管部门委托经营重要生产资料的供应公司；各地经济协作办举办的物资串换公司；大型企业和企业集团所属的物资供销公司。
    三、对外经济贸易公司，包括：对外经济贸易部门所属从事进出口业务的专业外贸公司；各级政府、各部门、群众组织、社会团体、部队所属的专业外贸公司，工贸、农贸、技贸、军贸公司以及易货贸易公司、边境等小额贸易公司、综合外贸公司、有外贸经营权的咨询服务公司。
    四、房地产开发公司，包括：房地产企业中不直接从事房地产产品的开发建设，而专门从事房屋、土地的买卖和出租活动的公司。
