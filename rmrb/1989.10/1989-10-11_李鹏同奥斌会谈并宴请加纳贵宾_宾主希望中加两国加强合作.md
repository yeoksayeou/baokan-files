Today in the afternoon, Premier Li Peng held a grand welcoming ceremony for Paul Victor Obeng, a member of the Provisional National Defense Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Ghana, who was invited to visit China. Subsequently, the two sides held a cordial and friendly talk in the East Hall of the Great Hall of the People.

Premier Li Peng said, "Three years ago, I was invited to visit the Republic of Ghana, where I met Chairman Rawlings and had a talk with you. Today, I am very pleased to be able to host you in Beijing and exchange views on the international situation, bilateral relations, and other issues of common interest. I wish you a successful visit."

Chairman Obeng said, "I am visiting your country at a crucial time when both Ghana and China are deeply engaged in economic reforms. The purpose of this visit is to discuss further development of friendly cooperation between the two countries. He said, Ghana has always attached great importance to economic relations with China. China's technical assistance to Ghana's agriculture has been very effective."

Chairman Obeng continued, "Ghana has always valued China's reforms. When some people in China carried out counter-revolutionary activities under the banner of so-called 'democracy' and 'freedom,' we felt disappointed. But we have always believed that the Chinese leadership and government can control the situation. Now, based on our observations, this is indeed the case."

At the request of the guest, Premier Li Peng briefed the situation of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing in the spring and summer of this year. Li Peng said, "Internationally, some people have pinned their hopes of 'peaceful evolution' on the third and fourth generations of China, taking advantage of China's reform and opening-up to infiltrate and subvert our country; within the Party, there are also different views on reform. He said, the correct understanding should be that reform is the self-improvement of socialism, not the pursuit of capitalism. Li Peng stressed that if this counter-revolutionary rebellion is not suppressed, China will change color."

In discussing the current situation in China, Premier Li said, "Although China is currently facing some temporary economic difficulties, the political situation is stable. Internationally, some people want to use economic means to pressure us to change our policies, but this will not succeed. We believe that after rectification and adjustment, the Chinese economy will ultimately succeed. This will undoubtedly create better conditions for future economic development and opening-up."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th.

Tonight, Premier Li Peng hosted a banquet in the West Hall of the Great Hall of the People to welcome Paul Victor Obeng, a member of the Provisional National Defense Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Ghana, and his entourage.

At the banquet, Premier Li Peng said, "In recent years, Ghana has achieved remarkable results in its domestic economic recovery program and has made successful strides in political system reform. In international affairs, Ghana pursues an active policy of neutrality and non-alignment, opposes hegemony, strives to strengthen African unity, and supports the just struggle of the Namibian people for independence and the South African people against apartheid. We appreciate the stance of the Ghanaian government and are genuinely pleased with the progress made by the Ghanaian people."

In discussing international issues, Premier Li Peng pointed out, "Over the past year, the situation on the African continent has undergone positive changes, with regional 'hotspots' generally cooling down, and the momentum for political resolution of disputes on the rise, which is encouraging. In particular, the start of Namibia's independence process marks that the day when the entire Africa achieves decolonization is not far away. Premier Li Peng expressed that the Chinese government firmly supports the African countries' just struggle to maintain national independence and legitimate rights and to oppose the apartheid system, and firmly supports the efforts of African countries to promote South-South cooperation and push for North-South dialogue."

Li Peng said, "The Chinese government and people are willing to learn from each other, support each other, cooperate closely, and move forward together with the Ghanaian government and people in the cause of building their own countries."

Chairman Obeng hoped and believed that China's economic reform would continue. Because many developing countries, including Ghana, can learn from it. He highly appreciated China's support for the liberation movements in Africa, especially the liberation movements in Southern Africa to achieve national self-determination and eradicate the detestable apartheid system.

He expressed that the Ghanaian government and people will make positive efforts to continue to strengthen mutually beneficial bilateral relations with friendly countries like China.

    李鹏同奥斌会谈并宴请加纳贵宾
    宾主希望中加两国加强合作
    本报北京10月10日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天下午，李鹏总理在人民大会堂东门外广场，为应邀来访的加纳临时全国保卫委员会委员、部长委员会主席保罗·维克托·奥斌举行了隆重欢迎仪式。随后，宾主步入大会堂东大厅进行了亲切友好的会谈。
    李鹏总理说，3年前我应邀访问加纳共和国，结识了罗林斯主席，并和阁下举行了会谈。今天，我为能在北京尽地主之谊，接待阁下访华，并就国际形势、双边关系和其他共同感兴趣的问题交换意见，感到非常高兴。我预祝阁下访问成功。
    奥斌主席说，我是在加纳和中国都在深入进行经济改革的关键时刻访问贵国的。访问的目的在于商讨两国进一步发展友好合作关系。他说，加纳一直非常重视加中的经济关系。中国对加纳农业方面的技术援助是卓有成效的。
    奥斌主席接着说，加纳一贯重视中国的改革。当中国有些人在所谓“民主”、“自由”的口号下进行反革命活动时，我们深感失望。但我们一直相信中国领导人和中国政府能够控制局势。现在根据我们的观察，事实正是如此。
    应客人要求，李鹏总理通报了今年春夏之交在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱的情况。李鹏说，国际上有人想把和平演变的希望寄托在中国的第三代和第四代身上，他们利用中国改革开放的时机，对我国进行渗透、颠覆；对于改革，中国党内也有不同的认识。他说，正确的认识应该是，改革是社会主义的自我完善，而不是搞资本主义。李鹏强调指出，如不平息这场反革命暴乱，中国就会改变颜色。
    在谈到中国当前局势时，李总理说，中国目前经济上虽有一些暂时的困难，但政治形势是稳定的。国际上有人想用经济手段压我们改变政策，这是做不到的。我们相信，中国经济经过治理整顿，最终会获得成功。这无疑会为今后的经济发展和对外开放创造更好的条件。
    本报北京10月10日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今晚，李鹏总理在大会堂西大厅设宴欢迎加纳临时全国保卫委员会委员、部长委员会主席奥斌一行。
    李鹏总理在宴会上说，近年来，加纳在国内实施的经济复兴计划已取得了可喜成就，并在政治体制改革方面迈出了成功的步伐。在国际事务中，加纳奉行积极中立和不结盟政策，反对强权政治，致力于加强非洲团结，支持纳米比亚人民争取独立和南非人民反对种族隔离的正义斗争。我们对加纳政府的立场表示赞赏，对加纳人民取得的进步感到由衷的高兴。
    在谈到国际问题时，李鹏总理指出，去年以来，非洲大陆的形势发生了积极变化，地区“热点”普遍降温，谋求政治解决争端的势头方兴未艾，前景令人鼓舞。尤其是纳米比亚独立进程的开始，标志着整个非洲完全实现非殖民地的日子已为期不远。李鹏总理表示，中国政府坚决支持非洲国家维护民族独立和合法权益以及反对种族隔离制度的正义斗争，坚决支持非洲国家为开展南南合作、推动南北对话而作出的努力。
    李鹏说，中国政府和人民愿与加纳政府和人民在建设各自国家的事业中，互相学习，互相支持，紧密合作，共同前进。
    奥斌主席在讲话中希望并相信中国经济改革将继续下去。因为包括加纳在内的许多发展中国家都可从中借鉴。他很赞赏中国对非洲的解放运动，特别是对南部非洲争取民族自决、铲除令人厌恶的种族隔离制度而进行的解放运动提供了慷慨的支援。
    他表示，加纳政府和人民将作出积极努力，继续加强同像中国这样友好的国家之间的互利双边关系。（附图片）
