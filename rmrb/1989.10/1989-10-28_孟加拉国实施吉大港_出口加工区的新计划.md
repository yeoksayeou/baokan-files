The Bangladesh government will begin implementing the second phase of the Chittagong Export Processing Zone development plan. The aim is to develop land, increase infrastructure, and create favorable conditions for more export-oriented enterprises and to attract foreign investment.

This plan is expected to cost 2.04 billion taka (approximately $64 million), while in the first phase, the government invested only 250 million taka (approximately $7.8 million) for the development of the zone.

The Chittagong Export Processing Zone was established in 1983. To date, 24 enterprises have started operations in the zone, exporting approximately 540 million taka (approximately $16.96 million) worth of products last year. Currently, 51 companies have been approved to invest in this processing zone, with a total investment of 14 billion taka (approximately $437.5 million). Among these, 12 are wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and 23 are joint ventures. In addition, the management bureau of the processing zone has received 154 inquiries from foreign investors.

It is reported that the Bangladesh government will also establish two more export processing zones in the capital Dhaka and the second-largest port of Chittagong, Khulna.

　　孟加拉国实施吉大港
    出口加工区的新计划
    孟加拉国政府将开始实施吉大港出口加工区开发建设的第二阶段计划，旨在开发土地，增加基础设施，为开办更多外向型企业和吸引外资创造有利条件。
    这一计划预计耗资20.4亿塔卡（约6400万美元），而在第一阶段，政府为该区开发建设只投资了2.5亿塔卡（约780万美元）。
    吉大港出口加工区创建于1983年，至今已有24家企业在该区开业，去年已出口了约5.4亿塔卡（约1696万美元）的产品。目前已有51家公司企业获准在这一加工区投资，投资额达140亿塔卡（约4.375亿美元）。其中12家是外商独资企业，23家是合资企业。此外，加工区管理局还收到了154项外商投资的咨询要求。
    据悉，孟加拉国政府还将在首都达卡和孟第二大港口库尔纳再开辟两个出口加工区。　　　　　　（欣花）
