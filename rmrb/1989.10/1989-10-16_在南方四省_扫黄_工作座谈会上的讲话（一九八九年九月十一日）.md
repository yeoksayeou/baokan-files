On August 24, the Party Central Committee and the State Council convened a national teleconference to rectify and clean up the book, newspaper, magazine, and audio-visual markets. After the conference, the "yellow" crackdown work was launched nationwide. Most provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have had Party and government leaders personally take charge, making specific arrangements. Many places have established specialized teams with leadership responsibility at various levels. The masses have strongly responded to the Central Government's decision on the "yellow" crackdown, unanimously expressing firm support and enthusiastic endorsement, believing it to be a good and practical deed for the people. Comrades Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and Wang Zhen, along with some senior comrades, have shown great concern for this work, hoping to see it through to the end and achieve results. Nationwide, a preliminary atmosphere for the "yellow" crackdown has been formed. Some regions that have acted quickly have already seized and banned a large number of obscene books and audio-visual products, shut down bookstalls and audio-visual markets that specialize in selling yellow publications, and in some cases, have followed the leads to investigate and deal with underground networks and publishing houses, printing plants involved in "manufacturing yellow" and "trafficking yellow." The market for books and publications has begun to change. Overall, the "yellow" crackdown has shown initial results, and the development trend is relatively normal.

However, we must also see that the "yellow" crackdown has just begun, with uneven progress in various places. Some "blind spots" have not been touched, and especially in some regions, the leaders have not truly taken it seriously, with the work still at the stage of general mobilization. Many tasks have not yet been truly implemented. Therefore, the urgent task at hand is to redouble our efforts, seize the momentum, and push the "yellow" crackdown to be carried out thoroughly and deeply, preventing it from being half-hearted.

To achieve this, the key is to strengthen leadership and ensure the work is tightly and concretely implemented.

First, grasp the understanding. The reasons why the "yellow" crackdown has not been deeply implemented in some places are many, but the main issue is that the leadership lacks a sufficient understanding of the importance and urgency of the "yellow" crackdown. This time, the Central Government has made a firm decision, and the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau unanimously agrees that it must be carried out resolutely. This is not an overreaction but an important component and a key task in implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The "yellow" crackdown is part of the struggle against bourgeois liberalization. The proliferation of yellow books and audio-visual products in society is both a result of bourgeois liberalization and a factor that has exacerbated its spread. One of the important means by which foreign hostile forces implement their "peaceful evolution" strategy against our country is to use "yellow, gambling, and drugs" to numb our people. The clear evidence of this is that during the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, some social dregs came out as vanguards. The "yellow" crackdown is a guarantee for the healthy progress of reform and opening up. Some comrades worry that the "yellow" crackdown will affect opening up, which is unnecessary. By eliminating yellow elements and cleaning up "flies" and "mosquitoes," we can improve the investment environment and better handle the work of opening up. The "yellow" crackdown is a breakthrough in strengthening socialist spiritual civilization. The persistent presence of obscene materials reflects serious mistakes in spiritual civilization construction over the past few years. Without solving this problem, it is impossible to talk about cultivating "four-haves" talents, improving national quality, and establishing a good social order. The "yellow" crackdown is a practical action to do real things for the people and establish the Party's prestige. The people have a strong aversion to yellow elements and have expressed their views strongly. If such matters cannot be handled well, it will be difficult to gain the trust of the people. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must put the "yellow" crackdown work on the agenda and take it seriously. You four provinces are located along the coast, with heavier tasks and more difficulties. I hope you will report to the main leaders of your provincial Party committees after returning, and hope they will pay more attention to this matter.

Second, grasp the implementation. A large amount of evidence shows that many of our tasks have not been completed not because the policies are wrong or the thinking is not good, but because the leadership style is not strict enough, and the work is not concrete enough, causing many good ideas to remain empty talk. To do a good job in the "yellow" crackdown and achieve the expected goals, the most important thing is to implement the work concretely, tightly, and specifically, and to follow through to the end. This is because: first, the "yellow" crackdown is difficult. Yellow books and audio-visual products have been rampant for a long time, and it is not a matter of one or two days; the scope is wide, covering many corners of cities and countryside; many people are involved, not only the general public but also Party members and cadres; and the "yellow sources" are connected domestically and internationally, both scattered and hidden, making the work very extensive. Without putting in real effort and doing concrete work, it is difficult to achieve results. Second, the "yellow poison" is deeply rooted. In recent years, due to the relaxation of education on the Four Cardinal Principles and weak ideological and political work, many young people have been influenced by the idea of "everything for money" and corrupted by Western decadent lifestyles, lacking lofty ideals and proper life pursuits. Some people have been deeply affected by the "yellow poison" and have reached a point of no return. A group of people see "manufacturing yellow" and "trafficking yellow" as a way to get rich, and indeed, some people and units have made a fortune by engaging in such illegal activities. Some county and township cadres also view such dirty dealings as a way to make money, not only failing to crack down but also shielding and indulging, and some even collude with outsiders to directly participate in illegal activities. Therefore, without concretely addressing the root causes, the "yellow" crackdown will be difficult to sustain, and even if there are short-term effects, it will be difficult to consolidate them. Third, there are historical lessons. The "yellow" crackdown is not the first time, so why has it been repeatedly banned without effect, and instead, it has become more rampant? An important reason is that the work has not been tightly, severely, and concretely implemented. Some "yellow traffickers" have taken advantage of our "one-time campaign" habit. When the "yellow" crackdown comes, they temporarily avoid the storm, go underground, and wait for the opportunity. Once the storm passes, they resurface and return, becoming even more brazen and escalating their actions. Therefore, this time, we must prevent the "yellow" crackdown from being half-hearted and failing halfway.

The key to implementing the work concretely and tightly is to overcome the tendency to be superficial and strengthen the specific guidance of this work. Each unit must have requirements, measures, arrangements, and inspections, and implement a responsibility system, layer by layer, to the person. The work should be focused on supervision, inspection, and concrete implementation. Relevant leaders should go to the frontline of the "yellow" crackdown and conduct a thorough inspection of the "yellow" crackdown work within their leadership scope. For example, has the social opinion and social force for the "yellow" crackdown been formed? Have the obscene, reactionary books and pornographic videotapes that should be seized and destroyed been seized and destroyed? Have the banned books and magazines been reviewed by the organization? Have the individual bookstalls selling all kinds of trash been managed? Have the leadership teams of publishing houses, printing plants, and bookstores with serious problems been reorganized and adjusted? Have measures to enrich the cultural life of the masses been implemented? Have policies and regulations for supporting excellent publications and strengthening the management of the audio-visual market been drafted? Such matters must be supervised, inspected, researched, and implemented one by one. The key to whether the "yellow" crackdown can be deepened lies in whether the masses have been truly mobilized. Those who know best about where the "yellow" is manufactured and trafficked are the masses. Only when the masses truly care about, support, and combine with specialized forces can a "yellow" crackdown net be formed, making the "yellow poison" have no place to hide, and creating a strong social opinion that "rejecting yellow" is glorious, "liking yellow" is shameful, and "trafficking yellow" is a crime. Only in this way can the work be truly implemented. The "yellow" crackdown involves many departments, including propaganda, culture, publishing, commerce, taxation, public security, customs, border defense, as well as education and mass organizations. All these forces must be organized to carry out comprehensive management. On the one hand, it is necessary to emphasize that each relevant department must take the initiative to assume responsibilities from a comprehensive perspective and avoid shifting responsibilities. On the other hand, the Party committee and the government must strengthen unified leadership, do a good job in organizational coordination, and clarify responsibilities. Mobilize the entire society's forces to form a "total war" situation and achieve victory in the "yellow" crackdown.

Third, grasp the key points. What are the key points of the "yellow" crackdown? This should vary according to the time and place. Nationwide, the current focus should be on solving the problem of "yellow sources." For those units and places that seriously produce and sell obscene publications, if we do not concentrate our efforts to eliminate them, the "yellow" crackdown will never be thorough. For example, places like Xiamen in Fujian, Wenzhou in Zhejiang, and Haikou in Hainan, these coastal regions should be the focus this time. These places are connected with overseas regions, where a large number of obscene videos and books are smuggled and pirated, and then sold to inland areas, causing harm nationwide. Some places have prostitution and gambling rampant, with "yellow, gambling, and drugs" all present, and have formed an underground black social force. These black strongholds must be firmly uprooted, and no leniency should be shown. Some provinces, including inland provinces, have publishing houses, printing plants, and book dealers that publish and print obscene and vulgar reading materials and yellow videotapes in large quantities, and have a well-organized underground distribution network. These units must be thoroughly rectified and cannot be a mere formality. Bad books must be seized and sealed, publishing houses and printing plants must be closed, and those responsible must be investigated. We now have too many publishing houses in some places, with some personnel having low quality and disorganized organizations, which is a good opportunity to cut down a batch. For those publishing houses and printing plants that are found to have produced yellow materials, their business licenses must be revoked, and their personnel, especially the responsible persons, must be educated and dealt with. Not only economic penalties should be imposed, but also administrative or legal responsibilities should be pursued. For those black dens that specialize in producing obscene videos, books, and illegal publications, they must be "uprooted" completely. The main organizers, producers, and sellers must be severely punished by law. Those who focus on "everything for money," sell publishing numbers, and assist in evil deeds, as well as the brokers of yellow books and audio tapes, must also be investigated and dealt with as key points.

Each locality should carefully study and determine its own work focus based on the actual situation. It is necessary to pay attention to concrete analysis and classified guidance. For those who do not take the lead seriously, the focus should be on solving the problem of taking the lead seriously; for those who have not mobilized the masses, the focus should be on mobilizing the masses; for those who do not implement the work concretely, the focus should be on implementing the work concretely. Grasping the key points requires determination and effort, perseverance, and thorough implementation. In terms of public opinion, it is necessary to create a momentum and attract the attention of the entire Party and society; in terms of forces, it is necessary to gather elite troops and concentrate forces to launch annihilation battles; in terms of deployment, it is necessary to scientifically organize forces, choose the right breakthrough points, and carry out work in an orderly manner; in terms of implementation, it is necessary to be swift and decisive, dare to confront difficulties, and not rest until the goal is achieved.

At present, while cleaning up various illegal, reactionary, and seriously politically erroneous publications and audio-visual products, it is necessary to first concentrate necessary forces to clean up yellow products. Distinguishing yellow works from non-yellow works is not particularly difficult. In addition to obviously obscene and pornographic publications and audio-visual products, for works that contain sexual content and nude or semi-nude images, the main consideration should be their purpose and starting point of creation and production, and the overall tone and tendency of the entire work. In some literary classics, for the sake of the plot, when describing male-female relationships, there may be some subtle descriptions or images, but the overall tone of the work is elegant, healthy, and beneficial. Such books or their audio-visual and film products should not be listed as yellow things. Some works are not like this. Their purpose of including sexual content and nude or semi-nude things is to find ways to sell and promote obscene things, or to use obscene things as a means to attract audiences or readers. The overall tone of the work is low, vulgar, and decadent, and it is harmful to the physical and mental health of young people. Its social effect is very bad, and such works are yellow things, not "borderline balls," and should be firmly prohibited and banned.

Grasping the key points means holding on without being swayed by criticism or overwhelmed by difficulties. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious,' and the Communist Party is the most serious." The "yellow" crackdown must have this serious spirit! The comrades in charge of the "yellow" crackdown work must have a clear understanding of their responsibilities and must personally participate in the implementation of important work. In short, it is necessary to pay attention to grasping the key points. Without key points, there is no policy, without key points, there is no method, without key points, there is no ups and downs, and we all should learn to grasp the key points.

Fourth, grasp the cases. Selecting cases with typical significance and publicly handling them is an important link to deepen the "yellow" crackdown work. This can demonstrate the leadership's determination, mobilize the masses, and intimidate the bad elements. This can also reflect the Party's policy. To isolate and strike a small number of bad elements, and to save those who have made minor mistakes and can be educated, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist, and to reward those who make amends and those who make great contributions. When selecting cases, each locality should pay attention to typicality, and be both lenient and strict, to disintegrate the bad elements and promote the work. Properly handling some cases can also lay a good foundation for the follow-up work and the formulation of relevant policies, guidelines, and regulations.

One of the important reasons why our past "yellow" crackdown work has not been effective is that we have been too lenient, either not handling cases that should be handled, or handling them lightly when they should be handled severely, or replacing legal punishment with economic penalties for those who should be sentenced. Therefore, the criminals' arrogance has not been truly curbed. This time, emphasizing the handling of cases is to resolutely reverse this situation and resolutely curb the criminals' arrogance. Otherwise, the masses will not be truly mobilized, and this evil trend will not be stopped in the future. We must handle and publicize cases like the handling of Liu Qingyan and Zhang Zishan in the early days of liberation, making criminals tremble with fear just by thinking about it. For those who are extremely evil and not killing them would not satisfy public outrage, they must be dealt with severely and swiftly according to the law. Then, with television, radio, newspapers, and other media, we must carry out extensive publicity to create a strong social opinion for the "yellow" crackdown, mobilize sufficient social forces, and promote the continuous deepening of the "yellow" crackdown.

Finally, let's talk about the issue of flourishing arts. In the entire process of modernization construction and reform and opening up, it is an extremely important and urgent task to strengthen socialist spiritual civilization construction, which is a long-term and arduous task. I have said that we must do one thing to crack down on "yellow" and another to flourish arts and activate the cultural life of the masses. This policy must be firmly adhered to. The prosperity of arts cannot be achieved by merely cracking down on "yellow." The prosperity of arts in any country relies on the development of healthy and excellent artistic creation and performances, using healthy and excellent artistic works and cultural activities to occupy the field, making yellow and vulgar low-level things have no market. Therefore, to fundamentally solve the "yellow" problem, we must use healthy things that the masses like to see and hear to occupy the ideological and cultural field, and meet the multi-level and multi-faceted cultural life needs of the masses. Flourishing socialist arts is a big issue. This conference cannot specially discuss it in depth, but it is a very important issue that must be solved with hard work.

    在南方四省“扫黄”工作座谈会上的讲话
    （一九八九年九月十一日）
    李瑞环
    今年8月24日党中央、国务院召开了全国整顿清理书报刊及音像市场电话会议。会后，“扫黄”工作在全国范围内铺开。大多数省、自治区、直辖市都由党、政负责同志亲自挂帅，做出了具体部署，许多地方层层建立了有领导负责的专门班子。广大群众对中央关于“扫黄”的决定反映强烈，一致表示坚决拥护和热烈支持，认为这是为群众办了一件好事、实事。小平、陈云、先念同志和一些老同志都非常关心这项工作，希望抓到底抓出成效。全国现已初步形成“扫黄”气候。一些动作较快的地区，已经收缴和查禁了大批淫秽书刊和音像制品，取缔了一些专门兜售黄色书刊的书摊和音像市场，有的还顺藤摸瓜，查处了一些“制黄”、“贩黄”的地下网络和出版社、印刷厂，书报刊市场面貌已开始发生变化。总的来看，“扫黄”已初见成效，发展态势是比较正常的。
    我们也要看到，“扫黄”工作刚刚开始，各地发展不平衡，一些“死角”还未触动，特别是有些地区领导还没有真正重视起来，工作还停留在一般号召阶段，不少工作还没有真正落实。所以，当务之急是，再加一把劲，乘势而上，推动“扫黄”工作扎实深入开展，防止虎头蛇尾。而要做到这一点，关键在于加强领导，把工作抓紧抓实。
    第一，抓认识。有些地方“扫黄”深入不下去，原因固然很多，但主要的还是领导上对“扫黄”的重要性和紧迫性认识不足。这次“扫黄”，中央下了决心，政治局常委一致认为必须下决心搞下去。这决不是“小题大作”，而是当前贯彻十三届四中全会精神的一个重要内容、一项重要工作。“扫黄”是反对资产阶级自由化斗争的一个组成部分。黄色书刊和音像制品充斥社会，既是资产阶级自由化造成的恶果，也为资产阶级自由化泛滥起了推波助澜的作用。国外敌对势力对我国推行“和平演变”战略的一个重要手段，就是利用“黄赌毒”来麻醉我们的人民。这次北京反革命暴乱中一些社会渣滓跳出来充当急先锋，就是明证。“扫黄”是改革和对外开放健康进行的一个保证。有些同志担心“扫黄”会影响对外开放，这是不必要的。把黄色的东西打掉了，把“蚊子”、“苍蝇”扫除干净，会有利于改善投资环境，把对外开放工作搞得更好。“扫黄”是加强社会主义精神文明建设的突破口。淫秽的东西屡禁不绝，反映了这几年精神文明建设的严重失误。不解决这个问题，“四有”人才的培养、民族素质的提高、良好社会秩序的建立等都无从谈起。“扫黄”是为群众办实事、树立党的威信的实际行动。群众对黄色的东西深恶痛绝，反映强烈，如果这样的事情也办不好，就无法取信于民。因此，各级党委一定要把“扫黄”工作摆到议事日程上，认真地抓起来。你们四省地处沿海，任务较重，困难较多，希望你们回去后向省委的主要负责同志认真地作个汇报，希望他们进一步关注这件事情。
    第二，抓落实。大量事实证明，我们的许多工作没有做好，并不是失之于方针不对头，思路不够好，而是因为领导作风不过硬，工作抓得不实，使很多好的设想流于空谈。“扫黄”工作要搞好，达到预期的目的，最重要的是要把工作抓实、抓紧、抓具体，抓住不放，一抓到底。这是因为：其一，“扫黄难度大。黄色书刊和音像制品泛滥成灾，时间长，“冰冻三尺非一日之寒”；范围广，遍及城乡许多角落；参与的人较多，不仅有一般的群众，也有党员、干部；而且“黄源”连结国内外，既分散、又隐蔽，抓起来工作量很大。不下点真功夫、做一番切切实实的工作，是难以奏效的。其二，“黄毒”根子深。近年来由于放松了坚持四项基本原则的教育，思想政治工作薄弱，为数不少的青少年受“一切向钱看”思想的影响和西方腐朽生活方式的腐蚀，缺乏远大理想和正当的人生追求，有的人中“黄毒”很深，已经到了不能自拔的地步。一批人见利忘义，视“制黄”、“贩黄”为发财之道，也确实有些人、有些单位靠干这种黑行道发了大财。一些县、乡的少数干部也把这种肮脏勾当视为生财之路，不仅不打击，反而包庇纵容，有些甚至内外勾结，直接参与了非法活动。因此，不实实在在地从根子上抓起，“扫黄”很难扫下去，一时见效的也难于巩固。其三，有历史的教训。“扫黄”至今已非一次，为什么三令五申，屡禁不绝，反而愈演愈烈？一个重要的原因就是工作抓得不紧、不狠、不实。一些“黄贩子”看准了我们有“一阵风”的毛病，“扫黄”来了，暂时避避风，转入地下，埋伏起来，等待时机。一等风头过去，他们就沉渣泛起，卷土重来，而且更加肆无忌惮，变本加厉。因此，我们这次“扫黄”必须防止虎头蛇尾，半途夭折。
    抓紧、抓实的关键是克服飘浮的作风，加强对这项工作的具体指导。各单位都要做到有要求、有措施、有部署、有检查，而且要实行责任制，层层落实到人。要把工作放到督促检查、狠抓落实上。有关领导同志要深入“扫黄”第一线，对自己领导范围内的“扫黄”工作进行一次认真的检查。例如，“扫黄”的社会舆论和社会力量形成了没有？该收缴的黄色、反动书刊和淫秽录像带收缴、销毁了没有？查封的书报刊组织审看了没有？兜售乌七八糟东西的个体书摊管起来了没有？问题成堆的出版社、印刷厂和书店的领导班子整顿调整了没有？丰富群众文化生活的措施落实了没有？扶植优秀出版物和加强音像市场管理的政策规章着手制订了没有？诸如此类的事情，都要一件一件地去督促、去检查、去研究、去落实。“扫黄”能不能深入，关键还在于是否真正把广大群众发动起来。哪里“制黄”、哪里“贩黄”，最了解情况的是广大群众，只有广大群众真正地关心、支持这项工作，并与专门力量结合起来，才能形成“扫黄”的天罗地网，使“黄毒”无处容身，形成“拒黄”光荣、“嗜黄”可耻、“贩黄”有罪的强大社会舆论，造成黄色的东西一露头就“老鼠过街、人人喊打”的局面。只有这样，工作才算真正地落到了实处。“扫黄”工作涉及宣传、文化、出版、工商、税务、公安、海关、边防，乃至教育和群众团体等诸多部门，必须把各种力量组织起来，进行综合治理。一方面，要强调各有关部门必须从全局出发，主动承担任务，避免推诿扯皮；另一方面，党委和政府必须加强统一领导，做好组织协调工作，明确分工。把全社会力量动员起来，形成打“总体战”的局面，夺取“扫黄”工作的胜利。
    第三，抓重点。什么是“扫黄”的重点？这应当因时、因地而异，就全国范围来说，当前要集中力量解决“黄源”的问题。对那些制作、贩卖淫秽出版物严重的单位和地方，不集中力量加以清除，“扫黄”就永远扫不净。如福建的石狮、浙江的温州、海南的海口等沿海地区的若干城镇，这次就要作为重点。这些地方连结海外，大量走私、翻制淫秽录像、书刊，并且推销到内地，祸害全国。有的卖淫嫖娼成风，“黄赌毒”俱全，已经形成了一股地下黑社会势力。对这些黑据点必须坚决拔掉，不允许姑息养奸。有些省份包括内地省份的一些出版社、印刷厂和书商，大量编辑出版、印制不堪入目的淫秽读物、低级庸俗读物和黄色录像带，并且有一套组织严密的地下发行网点。对这些单位必须彻底整顿，不能走过场。坏书要收缴封存，出版社、印刷厂要关闭，责任者要查处。我们现在一些地方出版社过多过滥，有些人员素质低下，组织混乱，正好借这个机会砍掉一批。对那些查实确有印制黄色物品的出版社、印刷厂等，要吊销其营业执照，对其人员特别是负责人要进行必要的教育、处理，不仅给予经济上的处罚，还要追究其行政或法律的责任。对那些专门制造淫秽录像、书刊和非法出版物的黑窝子，一定要“连锅端”，对主要的组织者、生产者、销售者要依法给予严厉打击。还有那些“一切为了赚钱”，卖书号、刊号助纣为虐的单位和个人，以及黄色书刊、音像带的掮客，也要重点查处。
    各地要根据实际情况精心研究确定自己的工作重点。要注意具体分析，分类指导。对领导不重视的，重点要解决领导重视的问题；群众没发动起来的，要首先发动群众；工作不实的，要狠抓落实。抓重点必须下决心、下力量，锲而不舍，狠抓到底。在舆论上，要造成声势，引起全党和全社会的关注；在力量上，要调集精兵强将，集中力量打歼灭战；在部署上，要注意科学组织力量，选好突破口，有秩序地开展工作；在实施上，要雷厉风行，敢于碰硬，不达目的，绝不罢休。
    当前，在清理各种非法的、反动的、有严重政治错误的出版物和音像制品的同时，要注意首先集中必要力量清理黄色制品。区分黄色作品与非黄色作品并不十分困难。除了明显的色情、淫秽的出版物、音像制品等外，对夹杂有色情内容、裸体半裸体画面的作品，主要看他创作、制作的目的和出发点，看整个作品的基本格调和基本倾向。在一些文学名著里，出于情节的需要，讲到男女私情时，有些细微描写或形象的画图，但整个作品的基本格调是高雅的、健康的、有益的，这类书刊或其音像、电影制品不应列为黄色的东西。有些作品不是这样，它夹杂色情、裸体半裸体东西的目的，是为了变着法子、拐弯抹角地兜售和宣扬淫秽的东西，或者是以淫秽的东西作为招徕观众或读者的手段，作品的基本格调是低下的、庸俗的、萎靡的，是有害于青少年身心健康的，其社会效果是很坏的，这一类作品就是黄色的东西，决不是什么“擦边球”，应该坚决予以禁止和取缔。
    抓重点，看准了就要抓住不放。要不为非议所动摇，不被困难所压倒。毛泽东同志说过：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲认真。”“扫黄”就得有这股认真劲！主管“扫黄”工作的同志，必须对自己负责的工作有清醒的认识，必须亲身参与重要工作的落实。总之，要注意抓重点。没有重点就没有政策，没有重点就没有章法，没有重点工作就没有波澜起伏，我们都应该学会抓重点。
    第四，抓案例。选择具有典型意义的案例大张旗鼓地进行处理，是促使“扫黄”工作深入一步的重要环节。这样做，可以显示领导的决心，可以把广大群众发动起来，把坏人震慑下去。这样做，还可以体现党的政策。为了孤立打击极少数坏人，挽救那些一时失足、错误轻微、可以教育过来的人，必须坚持坦白从宽、抗拒从严，立功者赎罪、立大功者受奖的政策。各地选择案例时要注意典型性，要有宽有严，以瓦解坏人，推动工作。有准备地处理一些案例，还可以为后期的处理工作，以及制定有关方针、政策、法规打下较好的基础。
    我们过去“扫黄”工作收效不明显的一个重要原因是手软，或该处理的没有处理，或该重处的轻处，或该判刑的以经济处罚代替法律惩办，因此犯罪分子的嚣张气焰一直没有真正打下去。这次强调抓案例，就是要坚决扭转这种状况，坚决把犯罪分子的气焰打下去，不这样群众就不可能真正地发动起来，不这样今后就不能刹住这股歪风。要像解放初期处理刘青山、张子善那样，大张旗鼓地处理和宣传，使犯罪分子一想起来就胆战心惊。对那些罪大恶极不杀不足以平民愤的，要按照法律规定从重从快处理，然后以电视、电台、报纸等配合进行大张旗鼓的宣传，借此造成“扫黄”的强大社会舆论，动员足够的社会力量，推动“扫黄”的不断深入。
    最后，讲讲繁荣文艺的问题。在整个现代化建设和改革开放的过程中，大力加强社会主义精神文明建设是一个极为重要而亟待解决的课题，是一项长期而艰巨的任务。我讲过，要一手抓“扫黄”，一手抓繁荣文艺和活跃群众文化生活。这个方针必须坚定不移。文艺的繁荣单靠抓“扫黄”抓不出来。任何国家文艺的繁荣，都要靠发展健康的、优秀的文艺创作和演出活动，用健康的、优秀的文艺作品和文化活动占领阵地，使黄色的低级庸俗的东西没有市场。所以，彻底地解决“扫黄”问题，从根本上说必须用健康的群众喜闻乐见的东西来占领思想文化阵地，满足群众多层次、多方面的文化生活需要。繁荣社会主义文艺是一篇大文章，这次会议不可能专门展开研究，但这是个非常重要的问题，非下硬功夫解决好不可。（新华社发）
