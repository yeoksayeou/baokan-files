Kim Il-sung, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, today emphasized the importance of educating young people to persist on the socialist path during a meeting with a Chinese military delegation. He stated that the socialist system is the best in the world and that it was achieved through the blood and sweat of countless people. We must educate the younger generation to uphold the socialist path.

Kim Il-sung made these remarks during a meeting with a Chinese military delegation led by Liu Huaqing, Vice Secretary of the Central Military Commission, at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang.

In a warm and friendly atmosphere, Kim Il-sung had an in-depth conversation with the delegation. He said, "China's adherence to the four cardinal principles is very good. Adhering to these principles is fundamental. Without these principles, even if the country becomes prosperous, it will be of no use."

He told Liu Huaqing, "Socialism is the best system, but there are people in the world who are trying every means to sabotage such a system. We are all old revolutionaries, and we must defend the fruits of the socialist victory."

Kim Il-sung once again expressed his support for the Chinese Party and government in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing.

After the meeting, Kim Il-sung hosted a luncheon for the entire Chinese military delegation.

Attending the meeting and luncheon were Kim Jong-il, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Minister of the People's Armed Forces, as well as Chinese Ambassador to the DPRK Wen Yizhan and military attaché Wang Da-hui.
