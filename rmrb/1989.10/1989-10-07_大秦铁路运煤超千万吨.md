	Daqin Railway Coal Transport Exceeds 100 Million Tons

	Our reporter He Guanghua and Mao Lei report: The first phase of the Daqin Railway, China's first double-track electrified heavy-haul railway, has been in operation for 10 months and has transported over 110 million tons of coal from Shanxi.

	The first phase of the Daqin Railway runs from Datong to Dashizhuang, covering nearly 411 kilometers, and was officially opened on December 28, 1988. Due to the shortened construction period, there were difficulties such as incomplete line equipment and inadequate production and living facilities. More than 6,000 railway workers along the line have used every means to transport more coal and transport it faster, increasing the number of trains from the initial 3 to 5 pairs per day to the current 30 pairs.

    大秦铁路运煤超千万吨
    本报讯  记者贺广华、毛磊报道：我国第一条双线电气化重载铁路--大秦铁路一期工程开通运营10个月，累计运出晋煤突破1100万吨。
    大秦铁路一期工程从大同至大石庄，全长近411公里，于去年12月28日正式开通。由于施工工期缩短，存在线路设备不全、生产生活设施不配套等困难。沿线6000多名铁路职工千方百计多运煤、快运煤，使列车开出对数由开始每天3对、5对增加到目前的30对。
