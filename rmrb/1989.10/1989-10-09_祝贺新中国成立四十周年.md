I, like all Soviet people, am delighted that the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is being celebrated at a time when relations between our two countries have been normalized. I have just returned from a trip to China, arranged by my Chinese colleagues, and I would like to share some of my impressions.

The 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been an important period in history. For me personally, they are a significant part of my own life. The story is as follows: just before the 4th anniversary of the founding of New China, I came to Beijing for the first time as the youngest correspondent of *Pravda* to begin my journalistic career.

I was able to visit the major construction projects of China's first Five-Year Plan. I was a witness to the first victory of the first Five-Year Plan. At the end of 1953, in the city of Anshan Steel Workers, new blast furnaces, tube and rail rolling mills were put into operation with great fanfare. Not long ago, I was able to see for myself that all these projects are still in operation. The Soviet "800" rolling mill, a product of the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, has been running continuously for 7 Five-Year Plans, producing 100 million tons of rolled steel for China each year. There is something even more pleasing: Anshan, which in the 1950s was called the "Magnitogorsk Steel Combine of China," has become a university of steel industry for the whole country, training 50,000 experts for similar enterprises nationwide. Many enterprises built during the first Five-Year Plan also play a role in training personnel for their respective industries.

Thirty years ago, I saw the first tractor produced in China, the "DT-54" crawler tractor, in Luoyang. Now, I have returned to this ancient city, and its new appearance is so striking that I can hardly recognize it, because the dense phoenix trees along the avenues have made the city look young. Now, when almost all provinces in China can produce tractors, the "First Tractor" joint venture is still the leading enterprise in agricultural machinery manufacturing and the center of agricultural machinery design.

The autumn of 1956 was unforgettable for me. At that time, I was writing daily reports for *Pravda* about the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. By then, China had laid the foundation for the industrialization of the country, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and individual industrial and commercial enterprises. The Eighth National Congress set the general line for the Party to build socialism and turn China into a developed country.

What is the difference between China in the 1980s and China in the 1950s? In the country I know and care about, have I seen anything unexpected, especially surprising? What caught my eye was the astonishing change in rural roads. In the traffic flow, rickshaws are no longer the mainstay, and small tractors or motorcycles with trailers have become the main means of transportation. These vehicles are loaded with bricks and tiles, rushing on the roads. This is also a characteristic of the times. After solving the problem of food and clothing, Chinese farmers first hope to rebuild their houses. Therefore, bricks and tiles are needed everywhere, and reinforced concrete slabs are being made.

Township enterprises are a new phenomenon in the economy, and we have not yet fully understood their significance. This new and efficient aspect not only ensures employment for 95 million farmers but also makes full use of surplus labor. Now, the production of township enterprises accounts for 28% of China's total industrial output and 20% of export products. I have been thinking that this experience might also be suitable for our country's Central Asia and Transcaucasia regions, where there are abundant labor resources.

To illustrate the achievements and difficulties of the republic over the past 40 years, I made two comparisons: first, China's population has increased from 540 million to 1.1 billion in these 40 years; second, in 1949, the ratio of industry and agriculture in the national total output was 3:7, and now this figure has been reversed. In these 40 years, if China's population had not doubled, the increase in agricultural productivity would have been felt even more. After all, in these years of reform, the total grain output has increased by one-third, and the production of meat and cotton has doubled.

The second comparison shows that China has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a major industrial power. Now, China's coal and cement production ranks first in the world, steel smelting and electricity production rank fourth, and oil production ranks fifth.

The decade of reform is also a decade of opening up. The open policy has enabled China to attract foreign loans and direct investments totaling $45.098 billion. By the end of 1988, a total of 15,948 foreign-funded enterprises of various types had been approved. There are hundreds of such enterprises in Shanghai alone, more than in the entire Soviet Union. This is an example. There are things we can learn from our Chinese friends.

During a visit to Xi'an, the deputy secretary of the provincial party committee told me: "Now that the relationship between Beijing and Moscow has been normalized, the open policy should be more actively applied to relations with the Soviet Union." "In history, this city was the starting point of the great 'Silk Road.' We are pleased to learn that a railway connecting China's Xinjiang and Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union will be built. Thus, we are as if rebuilding the great Silk Road."

Due to the shift of the center of world trade from the Atlantic to the Pacific, Europe's interest in Asia will increase in the 1990s, and at the same time, economic ties between Europe and Asia will increase. This opens up the prospect for China and the Soviet Union to become the pivot between Europe and Asia, the Atlantic and the Pacific. Cooperation between our two countries will accelerate regional economic integration and become a catalyst for the entire Asian process.

The age of 40 is a mature age. Socialist China, as a member of the international community with rich experience and heavy responsibilities, is welcoming its own anniversary. It is gratifying to see that China is increasingly actively using its strength and influence to promote the resolution of current urgent issues, ensuring the health and progress of humanity.

### 祝贺新中国成立四十周年

    祝贺新中国成立四十周年
    《真理报》政治观察家  弗·奥夫钦尼科夫
    我同所有的苏联人一样，感到高兴的是，中华人民共和国成立40周年是在我们两国关系正常化之后庆祝的。我刚刚结束中国同行安排的中国之行。这里我想谈谈自己的感想。
    中华人民共和国成立以来的40年，是历史上的一个重要阶段。对我个人来说，则是我自己生命的一部分。事情是这样的，在新中国成立4周年的前夕，我第一次来到北京，作为《真理报》最年轻的驻外记者开始了自己的记者生涯。
    我得以访问中国第一个五年计划期间的主要建设工程。我是第一个五年计划期间第一项胜利的见证人。1953年底，在鞍山钢铁工人城，新的高炉、轧管和轧轨车间隆重投产。不久前，我能经过亲眼目睹而确信，所有这些项目至今还在工作，苏联的“800”轧钢机——乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的产品，已连续运转了7个五年计划，每年为中国生产100万吨轧材。还有更使我高兴的事，50年代被称为
  “中国的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合公司”的鞍山，已经成为中国钢铁工业大学，为全国同类企业培养出了5万名专家。在第一个五年计划期间新建的许多企业现在也都起到了为本行业培养人才的作用。
    30年前，我在洛阳亲眼看到了中国生产出来的第一台拖拉机
  “DT—54型”履带式拖拉机。现在，我又来到这座古老的城市，新的面貌竟使我不敢辨认，因为林荫道旁茂密的梧桐树使城市变得年轻了。现在，当中国几乎所有的省份都可以生产拖拉机的时候，“第一台拖拉机”联合企业依然是农机制造的主导企业，农机设计的中心。
    1956年的秋天对我来说是令人难忘的。那时我天天为《真理报》撰写关于中国共产党第八次代表大会的报道。当时，中国已经奠定了国家工业化、农业和个体工商业社会主义改造的开端。第八次代表大会确定了党的建设社会主义和把中国建成发达国家的总路线。
    80年代的中国与50年代的中国有什么不同呢？在我所知道和关注的这个国家里是否看到了未曾料到的、特别是令我吃惊的东西！映入我眼帘的是农村道路上的惊人变化。在车流中，人力车早已不占主导地位，小型拖拉机或带挂斗的摩托车成为运货的主要工具。这些车辆满载着砖瓦在公路上奔驰。这也正是时代的特征。中国农民在解决温饱后，首先是希望翻盖住房。因此，到处都需要砖瓦，都在制作钢筋混凝土的板块。
    乡镇企业是经济中的新鲜事，它的意义我们还没有完全认识。这个新的、富有效益的方面不仅保障了9500万农民的就业，也大大利用了剩余劳动力。现在，乡镇企业的生产占中国工业总产量的28％，占出口产品的20％。我一直在想，这个经验可能在我国的中亚和外高加索地区也适宜，那里有着富裕的劳动资源。
    为了说明共和国40年来的成就和困难，我进行了两项对比：第一，中国人口在这40年间从5.4亿增加到11亿；第二，1949年工业和农业在国家总产值中的比例是3∶7，现在这个数字颠倒了位置。在这40年里，如果中国人口没有增加一倍，那么就会倍加感到农业生产率的增长。要知道，在改革的这些年里，粮食总产量增长了1／3，肉类和棉花生产增加一倍。
    第二项对比说明，中国已从落后的农业国成为一个主要的工业大国。现在，中国煤炭和水泥产量已在世界上占第一位，炼钢和电力生产占第四位，石油产量占第五位。
    改革的10年也是实行开放政策的10年。开放政策使中国得以吸引外国贷款和直接投资450.98亿美元。至1988年底，共批准兴办各类外商直接投资企业15948个。仅在上海，这类企业就有数百家，比在整个苏联还多。这就是范例。在中国朋友那里我们是有东西可以学习的。
    在西安访问时，省委副书记对我说：“现在，当北京和莫斯科的关系正常化之后，开放政策应当更积极地运用于同苏联的关系中”。“在历史上，我们这个城市是伟大的‘丝绸之路’的开端。我们高兴地得知，将修建连接中国新疆和苏联哈萨克斯坦的铁路。这样，我们犹如在重建伟大的丝绸之路。”
    由于世界商贸活动的中心正从大西洋转向太平洋，到90年代，欧洲对亚洲的兴趣将会日益增加，与此同时欧亚之间的经济联系也将增加。这为中苏开辟了成为欧亚之间、大西洋和太平洋之间支点的前景。我们两国之间的合作将会加快地区经济一体化，成为整个亚洲进程的催化剂。
    40岁是成熟的年龄。社会主义的中国已作为国际社会中富有经验和责任重大的成员来迎接自己的节日。令人高兴的是，中国越来越积极地利用自己的力量和影响，以推动解决当前的迫切问题，保障人类的健康和进步。
