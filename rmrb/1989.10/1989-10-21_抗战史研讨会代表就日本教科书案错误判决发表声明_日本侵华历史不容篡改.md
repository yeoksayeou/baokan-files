Representatives of the Anti-War History Symposium Issue Statement on Japanese Textbook Case's Erroneous Judgment
Japan's Invasion of China History Cannot Be Distorted

BEIJING, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- New China News Agency reporter Huang Zhimin and People's Daily reporter Ma Heqing report: Today, 50 representatives of the Chinese Anti-Japanese War History Academic Symposium held here issued a statement. They expressed strong indignation over the Tokyo District Court's ruling on October 3 this year in the lawsuit against the Japanese Ministry of Education for altering textbooks. The court ruled that certain historical facts in the textbooks "cannot be considered illegal." The representatives pointed out that this ruling, which distorts or even alters historical facts, has hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and the people of Asia, including the Japanese people.

The four-day academic symposium was attended by veterans of the Anti-Japanese War from across the country, well-known figures from the Anti-Japanese War, historians specializing in the history of the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, and visiting scholars from Japan and the Soviet Union in Beijing.

In the statement titled "History Cannot Be Distorted," the representatives said, "The Japanese invasion forces launched a full-scale invasion of China on July 7, 1937, at the Marco Polo Bridge, which has already been recorded in world history and Japanese history. The Tokyo District Court's ruling, which affirms the Ministry of Education's demand to alter certain historical facts in textbooks as 'not illegal,' is extremely unjust."

The statement sternly points out that the atrocities committed by Japanese militarism in China are well-documented and irrefutable. Those who deliberately distort or alter this history, or even attempt to erase it, are engaging in absurd behavior. The Tokyo District Court's attempt to exonerate the Japanese invasion group is absolutely unacceptable.

During this academic symposium, a specialized research institution for the history of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Anti-Japanese War History Research Association, was established. Zhu Muzhi serves as the advisor, Liu Dayou as the honorary president, and Bai Jiefu as the president.

　　抗战史研讨会代表就日本教科书案错误判决发表声明
　　日本侵华历史不容篡改
    本报北京10月20日讯　新华社记者黄智敏、本报记者马鹤青报道：今天在此间结束的中国抗日战争史学术研讨会的50名代表发表一项声明，就日本东京地方法院在今年10月3日对日本文部省修改教科书诉讼案作出的所谓修改教科书中某些历史事实“不能算违法”的错误判决，表示了极大的义愤，并严正指出东京地方法院对这种歪曲甚至篡改历史事实所作出的这一判决，伤害了中国人民和包括日本人民在内的亚洲人民的感情。
    出席这次为期4天学术研讨会的有来自全国各地的抗战老战士和抗战的知名人士、专门研究中国抗日战争史的史学专家，以及在京的日本和苏联的访问学者等。
    代表们在发表的题为《历史不容篡改》的声明中说，日本侵略军从1937年7月7日在卢沟桥发动对中国的全面侵略战争，本来早已载入世界史册，也载入日本史册。东京地方法院在判决中，竟肯定文部省要求修改教科书中某些历史事实“不能算违法”。这是极不公正的。
    这份声明严正指出，日本军国主义在中国的侵略暴行，事实俱在，证据确凿。有人蓄意歪曲或篡改这个历史，或者干脆把它抹掉，那是荒唐之举，东京地方法院为日本侵略集团开脱罪责是绝对不能容忍的。
    在这次学术研讨会上，还成立了专门研究抗日战争史的学术研究机构——中国抗日战争史研究会，朱穆之为顾问，刘大年为名誉会长，白介夫为会长。
