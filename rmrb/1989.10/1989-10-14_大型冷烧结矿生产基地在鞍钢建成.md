The first large cold-sintered ore production base designed by China was recently completed at Anshan Steel.

The construction of the large cold-sintered ore production base is one of the key technical renovation projects for Anshan Steel during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. This project adopts advanced technology from the sintering field in the 1980s, and upon full production, it can annually produce 3 million tons of cold-sintered ore. This type of ore is a "fine grain" urgently needed by blast furnaces for steelmaking, with high strength, low ash content, and uniform particle size. It can significantly improve the utilization rate of blast furnaces, reduce the coke ratio, and increase production while saving energy.

    大型冷烧结矿生产基地在鞍钢建成
    新华社沈阳10月13日电　（记者陈光明）我国设计的第一座大型冷烧结矿生产基地日前在鞍钢建成。
    大型冷烧结矿生产基地建设是鞍钢“七五”重点技术改造项目之一，这项工程采用了80年代世界烧结领域的先进技术，全部投产后，可年产300万吨冷烧结矿。这种矿石是炼铁高炉急需的“细粮”，强度高，灰分少，粒度均匀，可大幅度提高炼铁高炉利用系数，降低焦比，增产节能。
