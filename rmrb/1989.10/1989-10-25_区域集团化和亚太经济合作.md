At a seminar jointly organized by the Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the International Issues Research Institute of Shougang from September 18 to 21, more than 70 experts and scholars from relevant departments, research institutions, and universities across the country discussed the general trends in the economic development of the world and the Asia-Pacific region in the 1990s, the impact of the regionalization of the world economy on global economic and trade, and the prospects of various "economic circle" proposals in the Asia-Pacific region.

Most participants believed that the economic development of the world and the Asia-Pacific region in the 1990s would not encounter major setbacks. The growth rate of the world economy might be slightly higher than in the 1980s, but it would not experience high-speed growth. Some participants also believed that although the growth rate might be around 3% to 4%, given that this growth is built on the economic development of the past 40 years post-war, the base is large. In a sense, it can be said that it is not low-speed growth but medium-speed growth. Regarding the economic prospects of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1990s, most participants held a relatively optimistic view, believing that the Asia-Pacific region is the most vibrant part of the world economy, and its development speed will be significantly faster than that of other regions in the world.

Regarding the issue of the regionalization of the world economy, participants generally agreed that since the 1980s, the regionalization of the world economy has become an important trend in global economic development. It runs parallel with the trend of political multipolarity, mutually promoting each other, and both are products of the uneven development of the world economy and politics. With the development of regionalization, the world economy and trade will present a new pattern, which will have an unignorable impact on the future development of the world economy and politics. Some participants believed that regional economic blocs emphasize the maintenance of internal interests and have a clear tendency to exclude outsiders, which is not conducive to the development of the world economy and trade. Others believed that if regional economic blocs can actively promote economic cooperation within the region, thereby promoting the growth of the global economy and trade, and adopt limited protectionism towards the outside, then they may be beneficial to the world economy. However, the general view is that in the process of the regionalization of the world economy, most developing countries, due to a lack of funds and technology, have relatively weak product competitiveness and will be in a significantly disadvantaged position.

Regarding the prospects of establishing an "economic circle" in the Asia-Pacific region, most participants believed that due to the rapid growth of mutual trade in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, the significant increase in capital flows, and the further deepening of international division of labor, the conditions for establishing an "economic circle" have been created objectively. Currently, the consultation and coordination organizations for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region have also transitioned from non-governmental civilian forums to government-led ministerial-level consultation mechanisms. Due to the existence of various complex differences in political and economic systems, levels of productivity, social religions, values, and historical factors in the region, there are significant obstacles to formally establishing a large "economic circle" in the Asia-Pacific region. During this period, it is not ruled out that relatively small-scale sub-regional economic circles may be established first.

　　区域集团化和亚太经济合作

    在9月18—21日中国社会科学院亚洲太平洋研究所和首钢国际问题研究所联合召开的研讨会上，全国有关部门、研究机构、大专院校70余位专家学者就90年代世界和亚太地区经济发展的一般趋势、世界经济区域集团化对世界经济和贸易的影响和亚太地区各种“经济圈设想”的前景进行了热烈讨论。
    多数与会者认为90年代世界和亚太经济的发展将不会遇到大的挫折。世界经济的增长速度可能略高于80年代，但不会出现高速增长。也有的同志认为，虽说可能是3％—4％的增长速度，但因为是在战后40多年经济发展基础上的继续增长，基数大了，在某种意义上可以说已不是低速增长，而是中速增长。对90年代亚太地区经济发展的前景，多数同志持较为乐观的看法，认为亚太地区经济是世界上最有活力的部分，其发展速度将明显快于世界其他地区。
    关于世界经济区域集团化问题，与会者普遍认为，进入80年代以来，世界经济区域集团化已成为世界经济发展的一个重要趋势，它与政治多极化的趋势并行，相互促进，都是世界经济政治发展不平衡的产物。伴随区域集团化的发展，世界经济和贸易将出现新的格局，对未来世界经济政治的发展将产生不可忽视的影响。有的同志认为，区域经济集团强调维护其内部利益而具有明显的排外倾向，这对世界经济和贸易发展不利。也有的认为，如果它能积极推动地区内的经济合作，而促进整个世界经济和贸易的增长，又对集团外采取有限的保护主义，那么它对世界经济的发展也可能是利大而弊小。但普遍的看法是，在世界经济区域集团化过程中，多数发展中国家由于缺乏资金和技术，产品竞争能力较弱，将处于明显的不利地位。
    对于在亚太地区建立“经济圈”的前景，多数同志认为：由于近几年亚太地区相互贸易增长快，资金流动明显增加以及国际分工进一步加深等原因，客观上为建立“经济圈”创造了条件。目前亚太地区经济合作的咨询和协调组织也已从非官方的民间论坛过渡到由政府出面建立部长级协商机构的阶段。由于该地区政治经济制度、生产力水平、社会宗教、价值观念以及历史上形成的诸多复杂差异的存在，在亚太地区正式建立大“经济圈”的障碍重重。在这期间，不排除有先建立较小范围的次区域经济圈的可能性。
