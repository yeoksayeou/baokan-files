Washing Clothes
Wang Ying

Yunnan Province's Xuanwei is my second hometown. In February 1959, I bid farewell to my military school and joined thousands of fellow railway soldiers to gather here to build the Gui-Kun Railway. I miss every mountain and stone, every blade of grass and tree there, but most of all, I miss the local elders and villagers.

Behind our camp, there was a small river. The river was not wide, and the water was clear enough to see the bottom. On Sundays, the place was bustling with people. Local aunts, mothers, sisters, and younger sisters would come to the river with basins and baskets to wash clothes and vegetables.

I, a northerner from the ice city, washed clothes by hand and dried them in the grass (which meant laying the sheets on the grass by the river). The truck drivers had plenty of soap, so they washed quickly and often played in the water while doing so.

Next to me was a woman in her fifties named Li. She didn't wash clothes by rubbing them; instead, she used a stick to beat the clothes on a green stone slab. She would raise her arm and beat the clothes up and down. The sound of splashing water and the sunlight created a beautiful, colorful scene.

As we became more familiar with each other, we would often chat. Aunt Li was not very talkative and would use her eyes to communicate. Gradually, I got used to it. One day, while Aunt Li was beating the clothes, she started to cry. First, she sobbed quietly, then she cried loudly, and her cries echoed along the river. What could have made Aunt Li so emotional and sad? Later, I found out that it was the Double Ninth Festival. More than ten years ago, on this day, her son was conscripted into the army and left. She had washed and dried the clothes but hadn't had time to give them to her son before the troops marched to Qujing. After that, it was said that he went to fight in the Northeast, and then to Taiwan, and there was no news of him since.

Perhaps because of this, Aunt Li was particularly close to us soldiers; but for the same reason, she also dared not get too close to us. That deep bond between soldiers and civilians was truly heartfelt. She seemed to understand something but also had her doubts. Once, while washing clothes, I saw Aunt Li using ash, and I knew she was struggling financially. I handed her a bar of Light soap. She smiled bitterly and said, "I can't take it, I can't take it," and pushed it back to me with her rough, cracked hands. My eyes welled up with tears. Could it be that because of her son who had no news, she didn't even dare to accept "Light"?

Time passed, and the seasons changed. My comrades left a shining railway for the people of Xuanwei, and our unit was also preparing to leave. Aunt Li heard that we were going to Sichuan to build the Cheng-Kun Railway. One noon, she came to the company and found me, saying, "Can I wash your clothes for you?" Looking at Aunt Li, I was speechless for a long time. Several old soldiers who had participated in the Korean War pushed me, saying, "Go, go, we'll take care of it here."

I went to the river with Aunt Li. She rolled up her sleeves, soaked the clothes in water, and used the Light soap to rub them. Then she started beating them with the stick. Splash, splash, the water and soap bubbles shone brightly in the sunlight. At that moment, I saw Aunt Li's thin face covered in sweat. I gently wiped her sweat with a handkerchief. She looked up at me and murmured, "Old Platoon Leader, will you remember Xuanwei?"

"Yes, yes, I will still sing the Yunnan Lantern Festival song!"

Aunt Li smiled. This was the first time I saw her smile so happily. Suddenly, she stood up and hugged me with her wet hands, looking at me as if she were expecting her long-lost son. Aunt Li didn't cry, but I did. My cries were like the flowing water beneath my feet.

Now I use a washing machine, but I can never forget the scenes of washing clothes by the river in Xuanwei, Yunnan.

    打衣

    云南宣威是我的第二故乡。1959年2月，我告别军校同千万名铁道兵战士一道，云集这里，修建贵昆铁路。我怀念那里的一山一石，一草一木，更怀念那里的父老乡亲。
    驻地后边有条小河，河面不宽，水清见底。星期天人声沸沸，当地的婶子、大娘、姐姐、妹妹端着盆子，提着篮子，到河边洗衣、洗菜。
    我这个北国冰城人，洗衣用手搓，凉晒靠草窝（就是把被单放在河边的草地上）。汽车兵有的是肥皂，洗将起来也快当，时不时地连洗带玩。
    同我挨着的，是一位50岁左右姓李的大娘。她洗衣的方法不是搓，而是拿着一个棒子，把衣物放在青石板上，扬起胳膊，一上一下地打。只听得叮咚叮咚，水花四溅，在阳光下闪出五颜六色的光环，煞是好看。
    熟悉了，也常拉拉呱。大娘不苟言笑，用眼神看看你，就等于说话了。渐渐地我也就习惯了。忽一日，大娘击打着衣服，哭了起来，先是啜泣，后是放声，整个河边都听到呜呜的哭声。什么事使大娘这么动情和伤心呢？事后才知道，那一日是重阳节，十多年前，她的儿子正是在重阳节被号上兵，开拔了。她从河边洗衣回来，把晾干的衣服还没送到儿子手上，队伍已经开往曲靖了。以后呢？据说是赴东北作战，再以后呢，听说去了台湾，没有了消息。
    正是因为这个原因吧，大娘对我们这些当兵的，特别亲近；也由于这个原因，她也不敢十分接近我们。那种军民鱼水情，真是别有滋味在心头，她似乎有所悟又有所疑。有一次洗衣，我看大娘用草木灰，知道她生活拮据了，我顺手递给她一条光明牌肥皂。她苦笑着：“要不得，要不得。”用她干裂的手又退给我。我的眼圈红了，难道就因为她那无消息的儿子，连“光明”也不敢要么？！
    时光流逝，斗转星移。我的战友们为宣威父老留下一条闪光的铁路，队伍也要开拔了。大娘听说我们要去四川修建成昆铁路，一天中午，来到连里，找着我说：“我给你洗洗衣服可要得？”望着大娘，我久久地说不出话来。连里几名参加过抗美援朝的老兵，一个劲地推着我，连声地说：“去，去，这里有我们了。”
    我同大娘来到河边，大娘挽起袖子，把衣服泡在水里，她用光明肥皂在衣服上搓来搓去，然后用棒子打将起来。叮咚，叮咚，水花和皂花在阳光下光芒四射。这时，我看见大娘清瘦的脸上渍出汗来。我用手帕轻轻为她擦汗，她仰起头看着我，喃喃地说：
    “老班长，你会记得我们宣威吗？”
    “记得，记得，我还会唱云南花灯咧！”
    大娘笑了。这是我第一次看到她笑得这么开心。忽地，她立起身用湿乎乎的手抱住我，端详着。像企望她久别的儿子一样看呀看，大娘没哭，我倒哭了，那哭声就像脚下的流水。
    如今我用上洗衣机了，但怎么也忘不了云南宣威河边的那一幕幕打衣……
