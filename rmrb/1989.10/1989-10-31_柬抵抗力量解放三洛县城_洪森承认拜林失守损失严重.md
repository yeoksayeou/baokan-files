Cambodian Resistance Forces Liberate Three Loke County
Hun Sen Admits Heavy Losses in Loss of Bailleung

	BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- According to a broadcast by the Democratic Kampuchea radio station today, Cambodian resistance forces have liberated the city of Three Loke in Battambang Province.

	The broadcast said that on October 27 and 28, Cambodian resistance forces launched an attack on Three Loke County. The Phnom Penh military forces' 4th Division, 93rd Regiment, and part of a regiment transferred from Takeo Province were annihilated. The remnants of the enemy fled east along the 10th Highway.

	The broadcast said that after the attack on Three Loke County, the invading Vietnamese forces dispatched the 3rd Regiment of the 330th Division to reinforce the area. This Vietnamese force was annihilated by the resistance forces en route to Three Loke.

	In this battle, the resistance forces destroyed an enemy ammunition depot, seized two cannons, four military vehicles, and a large amount of ammunition and military supplies.

	BEIJING, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- PHNOM PENH -- Hun Sen, the puppet prime minister of the Phnom Penh regime, recently publicly admitted that the loss of Bailleung has caused severe losses to the Vietnamese and Phnom Penh puppet forces.

	Hun Sen made these remarks while hurriedly visiting the battlefield in western Cambodia's Battambang Province to inspect the situation.

	Bailleung is a strategic stronghold located in the southwestern part of Battambang Province. On October 22, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea captured the besieged city of Bailleung, defeating the 95th Brigade, the 196th Division, and disguised Vietnamese forces of the Phnom Penh puppet army, thus liberating the entire Bailleung region.

	The Vietnamese "ambassador" in Phnom Penh admitted on October 28 in response to a reporter's question: "The battle of Bailleung has caused severe losses to the Phnom Penh government army." However, he argued that only part of the military forces were "scattered," and most of the forces were "preserved."

	The "ambassador" also believed that the Democratic Kampuchea resistance forces might attack Battambang City, but he asserted that the "chances of success" for the guerrillas were slim.

	According to sources from the Cambodian resistance forces, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea has already controlled the 10th Highway from Bailleung to Battambang City. Another two anti-Vietnamese forces have also made progress in the northwestern part of Battambang Province. The Khmer National Liberation Army captured four Vietnamese-Phnom Penh military outposts along the 69th Highway in Tmob County on October 24 and 25. The Khmer People's National Liberation Front forces have launched another attack in the Svay Chek area.

　　柬抵抗力量解放三洛县城
　　洪森承认拜林失守损失严重
    新华社北京10月30日电　据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，柬埔寨抵抗力量解放了马德望省三洛县城。
    广播说，10月27日和28日，柬埔寨抵抗力量向三洛县城发起进攻。驻守县城和周围据点的金边军队第4师、第93团和从内地干丹省调来的一个团的部分官兵被歼，残敌沿10号公路向东部逃跑。
    广播说，三洛县城被攻击后，侵柬越军出动330师的第3团前去增援。这股越军在开往三洛途中被抵抗力量击溃。
    在这场战斗中，抵抗力量摧毁敌军一座弹药库，缴获大炮两门、军车4辆以及大批弹药和军用物资。
    新华社北京10月29日电　金边消息：金边政权伪总理洪森最近公开承认，拜林失守给越军和金边伪军造了严重损失。
    洪森是在匆匆赶到柬埔寨西部马德望省视察战场形势时说这番话的。
    拜林镇是位于马德望省西南部的一个战略重镇。民柬国民军10月22日攻克了被围困已久的孤城拜林，击溃柬伪军第95旅，第196师及伪装的越军部队，从而解放了整个拜林地区。
    越南驻金边“大使”28日在金边答记者问时也承认：“拜林一战使金边政府军遭到严重损失”。但他又辩解说，只有部分军队被“打散”，大部分力量还是“保存”下来了。
    这位“大使”还认为民柬抵抗力量游击队可能会进攻马德望市，但他断言，游击队“成功希望”渺茫。
    另据柬埔寨抵抗力量人士透露，民柬国民军已控制了拜林至马德望市的10号公路。另二支抗越力量在马德望省西北部也获得进展，西哈努克民族军24日和25日先后攻克特莫博县69号公路沿线4个越南—金边军队据点。高棉人民民族解放阵线部队已在斯外则一带再次发动进攻。
