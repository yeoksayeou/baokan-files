Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
Tune: "Gazing at the Tide"

    The nation's founding was a monumental event,
    A glorious beginning that all nations admire.
    Missiles soar to the sky, satellites orbit the Earth,
    From the nine borders, no noise can be heard.
    The direction must not deviate,
    Strive for the Great Harmony, avoid extravagance.
    Forty years of construction,
    The revolutionary tradition is most praiseworthy.

    Everywhere are famous mountains with mist and clouds,
    There are strange clouds, strange stones, strange trees, strange flowers.
    Beijing is elegant and clean,
    Flowers bloom like brocade, every visitor praises it.
    Do not impose sanctions recklessly!
    Suppressing rebellion is an internal affair,
    Why all the noise?
    Come, let's have a peaceful world,
    "Negotiate" and talk about everyday matters.

　　庆祝建国四十周年
　　调寄望海潮
　　郭化若
    惊天动地，辉煌开国，万邦共仰中华。导弹冲天，星球绕地，九边四顾无哗。方向莫偏差，向大同迈进，力戒豪奢。四十年建设，革命传统最堪嘉。
    名山处处烟霞，有奇云、奇石、奇树、奇花。燕京雅净，香花铺锦，游人个个欣夸。制裁莫乱加！平叛属内政，何事喧哗？来日和平世界，“谈判”话桑麻。
