State Administration of Foreign Exchange officials recently responded to questions from Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the disclosure of China's foreign debt figures over the past four years.

Reporter: Why disclose China's foreign debt figures now?

Answer: As China's reform and opening-up progresses, the scale of utilizing foreign capital continues to expand. Practice has proven that borrowing foreign debt is an important source of funds for China's economic development, playing a positive role in promoting China's economic development. Currently, both domestic and international parties are very concerned about China's foreign debt issues and hope to understand China's foreign debt situation over the past few years. This is an objective requirement of reform and opening-up. To increase China's transparency in foreign opening-up and to clarify international financial circles' various speculations about China's foreign debt balance, the State Council has decided to disclose China's foreign debt balances at the end of each year from 1985 to 1988.

Reporter: In the past, some domestic and international publications have reported on China's foreign debt figures. What is your view on this?

Answer: In the past, some publications have reported on China's foreign debt figures from different sources and different perspectives. We do not comment on this. According to the relevant foreign debt management division of labor principles of the state, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange is responsible for the statistical monitoring and external disclosure of China's foreign debt figures. The foreign debt figures disclosed this time are based on the foreign debt scope determined by the "Provisional Regulations on Foreign Debt Statistical Monitoring" approved by the State Council and published by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which is also the usual foreign debt scope internationally.

Reporter: What are the main contents of China's foreign debt scope?

Answer: China's foreign debt scope is basically the same as the foreign debt scope used by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It refers to the debts incurred by agencies, organizations, enterprises, institutions, financial institutions, or other entities within China's borders to international financial organizations, foreign governments, financial institutions, enterprises, or other entities outside China's borders using foreign currency, with contractual repayment obligations. Specifically, it includes loans from international financial organizations, foreign government loans, loans from foreign banks and financial institutions, buyer's credit, loans from foreign enterprises, issuance of foreign currency bonds, international financial leasing and deferred payments, debts directly repaid in foreign exchange in compensatory trade, and other forms of debts.

Reporter: Some people say that the 1990s will be a peak period for China's debt repayment, and there may be difficulties in repayment at that time. What is your view on this?

Answer: We believe that the peak of debt repayment and debt repayment difficulties are two different things. The peak of debt repayment refers to the relatively highest amount of debt repayment, while debt repayment difficulties refer to the ability to bear the debt. If there is no ability to bear the debt, difficulties will arise even before reaching the peak of debt repayment. As for China, even if the 1990s see a peak in debt repayment, there will be no debt repayment difficulties. This is because China's foreign debt is completely within the country's foreign debt-bearing capacity, the foreign debt structure and foreign debt direction are basically reasonable, and the distribution of foreign debt terms is relatively even; in recent years, China's trade and non-trade foreign exchange earnings have increased significantly, and foreign exchange reserves have increased; the debt repayment ratio and debt ratio are both below the internationally recognized danger warning line. Therefore, as long as we pay attention to learning from the lessons of some developing countries that have experienced debt crises, strictly follow the state's relevant foreign debt management principles, strengthen foreign debt management, and improve the efficiency of foreign debt utilization, we can ensure the timely repayment of principal and interest on foreign debts in the future.

Reporter: What principles does China's foreign debt management follow now?

Answer: The overall principle of China's foreign debt management is "unified leadership, division of responsibilities," that is, the State Council takes unified leadership, and relevant government departments take divided responsibilities.

The principle of borrowing foreign debt is that the total amount of borrowing should be controlled, the foreign debt structure should be reasonable, and it should be in line with one's repayment and absorption capacity; it must be used in production and construction, and it must be used effectively and efficiently; it must be repaid on time to maintain foreign credibility. This is also the basis for our formulation of foreign debt management policies. Adhering to these principles is the guarantee for China to achieve results in utilizing foreign capital.

    国家外汇管理局负责人谈公布外债数字
    我国外债在承受能力范围之内  借用原则是总额控制结构合理
    新华社北京10月6日电　国家外汇管理局负责人日前就公布我国近4年外债数字回答了新华社记者提问。
    记者：为什么要现在公布我国的外债数字？
    答：随着我国改革开放进一步发展，利用外资规模逐年扩大。实践证明，借外债是我国发展经济的重要资金来源之一，对我国经济发展起了积极的促进作用。目前，国内外人士都十分关心中国的外债问题，希望能通报我国近几年外债情况，这是改革开放的客观要求。为了增强我国对外开放的透明度，澄清国际金融界人士对中国外债余额的种种猜测，国务院决定对外公布我国1985年至1988年各年末全国外债余额数。
    记者：过去国内外一些报刊曾透露过有关中国的外债数字，您对这个问题怎样看？
    答：过去一些报刊曾从不同来源和不同口径报道过有关中国的外债数字，我们不予评论。根据国家有关外债管理分工原则，国家外汇管理局负责全国外债的统计监测和对外公布我国外债数字。此次公布的外债数字，是根据经国务院批准由国家外汇管理局公布的《外债统计监测暂行规定》确定的外债范围，也即是国际上通常的外债口径。
    记者：我国的外债口径包括哪些主要内容？
    答：我国的外债口径与国际货币基金组织和世界银行采用的外债口径基本相同。是指中国境内的机关、团体、企业、事业单位、金融机构或者其他机构对中国境外的国际金融组织、外国政府、金融机构、企业或者其他机构用外国货币承担的具有契约性偿还义务的全部债务。具体包括有国际金融组织贷款、外国政府贷款、外国银行和金融机构贷款、买方信贷、外国企业贷款、发行外币债券、国际金融租赁和延期付款、补偿贸易中直接以现汇偿还的债务，以及其它形式债务等。
    记者：有人说进入90年代是中国的偿债高峰，到时候是否会出现偿债困难？
    答：我们认为，偿债高峰与偿债困难是两回事。因为偿债高峰是偿债数额中的相对最高额，偿债困难是对债务的承受能力。如果没有承受能力，即使不到偿债高峰，也会发生困难。就我国而言，即使进入90年代偿债高峰，也不会发生偿债困难。这是因为，我国的外债完全在国家外债承受能力范围之内，外债结构和外债投向基本合理，外债的期限分布也比较均匀；近几年我国的贸易和非贸易外汇收入有大幅度增长，外汇储备是净增加的；偿债率和债务率都低于国际公认的危险警戒线。因此，只要我们重视吸取某些发展中国家发生债务危机的教训，认真遵守国家有关外债管理原则，加强外债管理，提高外债的使用效益，就能够保证将来按时对外债的还本付息。
    记者：现在我国的外债管理遵守哪些原则？
    答：我国外债管理的总原则是“统一领导，分工负责”，即由国务院统一领导，政府各有关部门分工负责。
    借用外债的原则是，借外债的总额要有控制，外债结构要合理，要同自己的偿还能力和消化能力相适应；一定要用在生产建设上，而且要用的好，用的有效益；要按时还本付息，维护对外信誉。这也是我们制定外债管理政策的依据，掌握好这些原则是我国利用外资取得成效的保证。
