The 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) identified accelerating economic and technological ties with the outside world as an important reform measure for achieving the strategy of accelerating socio-economic development. For decades, the Soviet Union had limited its economic and technological ties with the outside world to merely "balancing surpluses and deficits," essentially adopting a policy of self-reliance. As a result, many of its technologies lagged behind those of the West. For example, the Soviet Union's steel production is currently twice that of the United States, but it still needs to import cold-rolled steel sheets for the automotive industry from the West.

After Gorbachev took office, he adjusted the strategic guiding ideology for economic and technological ties with the outside world. He believed that external economic factors are powerful accelerators for scientific and technological economic development and important means to solve political tasks, rather than just a matter of "balancing surpluses and deficits." He pointed out that the Soviet economy would be integrated with the world economy in stages.

The Soviet Union first improved the cooperation mechanism with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries, shifting from trade-based cooperation to highly specialized and close cooperation to promote further economic and technological integration among CMEA countries. It improved the cooperation methods with other CMEA countries, giving production enterprises broad direct contact rights, from selecting cooperation partners, determining cooperation methods, to signing contracts and negotiating product prices.

The Soviet Union strengthened its economic ties with Western developed countries and actively sought to join international economic organizations. It has been requesting to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) since 1986. Under the Soviet Union's initiative, the CMEA and the European Economic Community established formal relations last year.

Establishing joint ventures is an important form of the Soviet Union's strengthened international economic cooperation, as joint ventures can attract foreign capital, introduce advanced technologies, and advanced management methods. The Soviet Union has made significant progress in establishing joint ventures: by early 1987, there were only 7 joint ventures, but by the end of 1988, this number had grown to 160, and by July 1, 1989, the Soviet Union had established 680 joint ventures, 88% of which were with capitalist countries.

To accelerate the pace of economic ties with the outside world, the Soviet Council of Ministers passed a special resolution in December 1988 to relax policies on establishing joint ventures. For example, it abolished the regulation on the share of foreign investors in joint ventures, allowing the chairman or general manager of a joint venture company to be a foreign citizen. It also imposed the lowest import tax or completely exempted joint ventures from taxes for goods imported for production development. At the same time, it greatly simplified the procedures for establishing joint ventures.

The reform of the foreign trade system has progressed rapidly. For example, it was stipulated that from April of this year, all enterprises, joint-stock companies, and other organizations whose products and services have competitive advantages in foreign markets can directly engage in import and export business on the basis of self-accounting for foreign exchange earnings and decide on export items independently. They can also use foreign exchange earnings to independently import the equipment needed for production.

Due to the adoption of the above active measures, a new situation of companies engaging in foreign trade has been formed. In addition to joint ventures, the Soviet Union's joint ventures overseas are also developing rapidly, with more than a hundred active in Western countries. These joint ventures are mostly engaged in commerce or manufacturing, with some operating banks, transportation, or technical services.

The Soviet Union is actively planning to establish free economic zones. This autumn, the Soviet Union will establish a "free enterprise activity zone" in the Vyborg region to attract Western enterprises to cooperate with Soviet companies. The Soviet Union has decided to establish a new free economic zone in the Far Eastern city of Nakhodka. It is reported that the proposed Far Eastern free economic zone also includes Sakhalin Island, the Kamchatka Peninsula, Vladivostok, and the regions of Khasan, Khabarovsk, and others.

In developing economic ties with the outside world, the Soviet Union still faces many problems, such as bureaucratism, shortages of high-quality raw materials for joint ventures, and the need for further improvement of legislation related to joint ventures. The Soviet Union has taken several significant steps in accelerating economic and technological ties with the outside world.

　　苏联加速对外经济科技联系
　　方萱
    苏共27大把加速对外经济科技联系作为实现加速社会经济发展战略的重要改革措施。几十年来，苏联把对外经济科技联系只局限于“调剂余缺”上，基本上实行的是闭关自守的政策，因此很多技术落后于西方。例如，苏联目前钢产量是美国的两倍，但汽车工业用的冷轧钢板还需从西方进口。
    戈尔巴乔夫执政后，在对外经济技术联系的战略指导思想上作了调整。他认为，对外经济因素是科技经济发展强有力的加速器和解决政治任务的重要手段，而不仅仅是“调剂余缺”的问题。他指出，苏联经济将分阶段同世界经济联成整体。
    苏联首先改进了同经互会国家的合作机制，把它与经互会国家以贸易关系为主的合作转向生产高度专业化的密切合作，促进经互会国家的经济和科技的进一步一体化。它改进了与经互会其他国家的合作方式，生产企业享有广泛的直接联系权，从选择合作伙伴、确定合作方式到签订合同、协商产品价格。
    苏联加强与西方发达国家的经济联系，积极争取参加国际经济组织。它从1986年起就要求加入关贸总协定。在苏联的推动下，经互会与欧洲经济共同体去年建立了正式关系。
    建立合资企业是苏联加强国际经济合作的重要形式，因为合资企业可以吸引外资、引进先进技术和先进的管理方法。苏联在建立合资企业方面取得了长足进展：1987年初，合资企业总共才有7家，到1988年底发展到160家，到今年7月1日苏已成立680家合资企业，其中88％是与资本主义国家合资的。
    为了加快对外经济联系步伐，苏联部长会议1988年12月通过专门决议，放宽兴建合资企业的政策。如规定取消外国投资者在合资企业中的股份规定，合资公司的董事长或总经理可由外国公民担任，对合资企业为发展生产而进口的商品将征收最低进口税。或者完全免税；同时还大大简化了建立合资企业的手续。
    外贸体制改革进展迅速，如规定从今年4月起，凡是产品和服务在国外市场上拥有竞争能力的一切企业、联合公司等组织，在外汇自负盈亏的基础上均可以直接经营进出口业务，并自行决定出口项目，同时还可以用外汇收入自主进口生产所需要的设备等。
    由于采取了上述积极措施，就形成了公司办外贸的新局面。除合资企业外，苏联在国外的合营企业也日益发展，活跃于西方国家的合营企业已达百家以上。这些合营企业大多从事商业或制造业，也有一部分经营银行、运输或技术服务。
    苏联积极筹建自由经济区。今年秋天，苏联在维堡地区将建立“自由企业活动区”，以便吸引西方的企业同苏联公司进行合作。苏联已决定在远东城市纳霍德卡建立新的自由经济区。据悉，拟议中的远东自由经济区还包括萨哈林岛、堪察加半岛、符拉迪沃斯托克及哈桑、哈巴罗夫斯克等地区。
    在开展对外经济联系方面，苏联还面临不少问题，如官僚主义、合资企业优质原料短缺、有关合资企业的立法还有待完善等。苏联在加速对外经济科技联系方面已迈出了有重大意义的头几步。
