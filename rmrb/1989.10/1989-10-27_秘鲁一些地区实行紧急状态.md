The Peruvian government announced that starting from October 23rd, a state of emergency will be implemented for one month in the regions of Lima and Callao to curb the escalating violence and ensure the smooth conduct of the municipal elections scheduled for November 12th.

During this period, the armed forces will enforce political and military control in the aforementioned regions. Constitutional rights such as freedom of assembly, freedom of movement, the inviolability of the home, and the protection against arbitrary arrest without a court order will be temporarily suspended. Other regions in Lima Province have already been under a state of emergency prior to this.

As the date of the municipal elections approaches, the wave of violence in Peru continues to intensify, with violent assassinations primarily targeting local mayors and candidates for the municipal elections. According to statistics from the Peruvian Senate's Peace Committee, 47 mayors have been assassinated since the beginning of this year. Under the threat of this wave of assassinations, some local and county-level municipal authorities in Peru have vacancies, but no one is willing to run for these positions. According to government estimates, approximately 200 mayors or municipal election candidates have announced their resignation or withdrawal from the race.

　　秘鲁一些地区实行紧急状态
    本报加拉加斯10月26日电  记者朱满庭报道：秘鲁政府宣布从本月23日起在利马和卡亚俄地区实行为期1个月的紧急状态，以制止日益严重的暴力浪潮，确保11月12日举行的市政选举顺利进行。
    在此期间，武装部队在上述地区执行政治和军事管制，宪法规定的集会自由、通行自由、家庭住宅不受侵犯、无法官书面命令不受逮捕等权利将暂时取消。利马省的其它一些地区在此之前已进入紧急状态。
    随着市政选举日期的临近，秘鲁的暴力浪潮不断加剧，暴力暗杀活动的主要目标是各地的市长和参加市政选举的候选人。据秘鲁参议院和平委员会统计，今年年初已有47位市长死于暗杀。在暗杀浪潮的威胁下，秘鲁内地一些地、县一级的市政当局虽出现空缺，但没有人出来竟选这些职务。根据政府方面的估计，迄今约有200个市长或市政选举候选人已宣布辞职或退出竞选。
