Ten years ago, the Taoshan Forestry Bureau in the northern region had a popular saying: "Taoshan is poor, Taoshan is bitter, talented people do not settle in Taoshan." At that time, the Heilongjiang Province Yichun Forestry Area, under the guidance of the "big timber" ideology, produced raw logs year after year, and the resource crisis and economic difficulties were already showing signs. The Taoshan Forestry Bureau, caught in the midst of this, could not escape its fate. The state needed timber, the local government needed taxes, and ten thousand employees needed to eat. Life was extremely difficult. By the end of 1978, the accumulated losses were nearly five million yuan.

Ten years later, today, the Taoshan Forestry Bureau has risen to the rank of a national second-level enterprise, becoming a shining star in the Xiao Xing'an Mountains of Heilongjiang. What caused this dramatic change in ten years? The people of Taoshan say it is the fruit of the reform and opening-up policy, the result of forestry promoting tourism and tourism promoting all industries, and a new path to prosperity for the forestry economy.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, the winds of reform and opening-up have blown into the Xiao Xing'an Mountains, and the people of Taoshan have quickly become active.

"We have 180,000 hectares of land in our forestry bureau, with unique natural landscapes in all four seasons, which can be developed for tourism. Why must we focus on cutting a few big trees?" "Developing tourism can help us make friends, communicate information, attract foreign investment, technology, and talent, and also expand foreign trade exports, with all benefits and no harm. One industry promotes a hundred industries, why not do it?" A large-scale discussion from the bottom up and from the top down made the decision-makers of the Taoshan Forestry Bureau finally decide: open the mountain gates and develop tourism.

They acted immediately. With the support of higher authorities, the Taoshan Hotel hung the signs of China Travel Taoshan Branch and Taoshan International Travel. They renovated the Taoshan Hotel, which covers an area of 50,000 square meters. Inside the courtyard, there are high-rise buildings, single-story houses, rainbow bridges, and green waters. In summer and autumn, there are green willows and red flowers, and in winter and spring, there are ice sculptures everywhere. In a situation where funds were extremely tight, they planned carefully and invested year by year to gradually renovate the Eagle Beak Cliff, Xiangsi Mountain, Xuan Yang Peak, Stone Pagoda Pine, and the well-preserved primeval forest located deep in the forest. They built a ski resort and a shooting range; they opened the first natural wildlife breeding and hunting ground in China that is open to foreigners. During the peak tourist season, there is also the Northeast Great Dragon Lantern Dance team performing with the tourists, attracting many tourists. American tourist Mr. Dick said after a hunting trip, "I have hunted in six countries, but I have not seen facilities as complete as yours, and a camp as luxurious and comfortable as yours."

From 1981 to 1988, Taoshan has received more than 20,000 tourists from 15 countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, earning more than 100 million yuan in foreign exchange; it has received more than 140,000 domestic tourists, earning more than 23 million yuan in income.

The development of the tourism industry has opened up channels for introducing foreign capital and technological equipment. They have reached agreements with businessmen from Singapore and Hong Kong to jointly build factories using local resources, and have introduced advanced technology and equipment from West Germany to establish a flooring block factory. They have successively cooperated with 38 enterprises inside and outside the province to develop new products. Various forms of introduction and cooperation have increased the value of the Taoshan Forestry Bureau by 280 million yuan and earned a profit of 78 million yuan.

Developing tourism has broadened the horizons of the people of Taoshan, making them deeply realize that increasing forest resources is the starting point and the ultimate goal of all work in forestry enterprises, and has strengthened their determination to take forestry as the foundation. The speed of afforestation has accelerated. In the eight years of developing tourism, the area of afforestation and preservation has reached 470,000 mu, equivalent to the total area of afforestation and preservation in the 19 years since the establishment of the bureau.

Tourism has also promoted the vigorous development of the catering service industry, transportation industry, and tourism commodity processing industry. The processing industry of local specialties such as wood ear, ginseng, pine nuts, deer antler, and wild vegetables has also emerged. The entire bureau presents a thriving scene with various businesses and industries flourishing.

　　无限风光在桃山
　　傅刚  冯泰
    十年前，北国桃山林业局流传着这样的顺口溜：“桃山穷，桃山苦，能人不落桃山户”。当时，黑龙江省伊春林区在“大木头”挂帅的思想指导下，年复一年地生产原木，资源危机、经济困难的局面已经初露端倪。身在其中的桃山林业局也难逃厄运。国家要木材，地方要税利，万名职工要饭吃。日子过得十分艰难。到一九七八年底累计亏损近五百万元。
    十年后的今天，桃山林业局已跻身于国家二级企业行列，成为黑龙江小兴安岭上的一颗明珠。十年巨变，原因何在？桃山人说，是改革开放政策的结晶，是林业带旅游，旅游促各业的结果，走上了繁荣林区经济的一条新路。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，改革开放的东风吹到了小兴安岭，桃山人也很快活跃起来。
  “我们林业局有十八万公顷地盘，四季都有大自然赋予的北国林海特有景观，可以发展旅游，为什么非盯着砍几根大木头不可？”“发展旅游，可以广交朋友，沟通信息，吸引外资、技术和人才，还可以扩大外贸出口，有百利而无一害。一业促百业，何乐而不为？”一场自下而上、自上而下的大讨论，使桃山林业局的决策者们终于下定了决心：打开山门，发展旅游。
    说干就干，在上级的支持下，桃山宾馆挂出了国旅桃山支社和桃山中旅的牌子。对占地五万平方米的桃山宾馆进行了改造，院内有高楼，有平房，虹桥碧水，湖亭相映，夏秋柳绿花红，冬春冰雕处处。在资金十分紧张的情况下，他们精打细算，逐年投资，对坐落在林海深处的鹰嘴岩、相思山、悬羊峰、石塔青松和保存完好的原始森林逐年进行修饰；修建了滑雪场和靶场；开辟了我国第一个对外开放的天然野生动物饲养狩猎场。旅游旺季，还有东北大秧歌队与游人同乐，吸引了众多的旅游者。美国游客迪克先生在一次狩猎结束后对导游员说：“我到过六个国家狩猎，设施像你们这样齐全，营地像你们这样豪华舒适，我还没有见过。”
    从一九八一年到一九八八年，桃山已接待来自美国、日本、新加坡、香港等十五个国家和地区的游客二万多人，创汇一百多万元；接待内宾十四万余人，收入二百三十多万元。
    旅游业的发展，开通了引进外资和技术设备的渠道。他们已与新加坡、香港的客商分别达成了利用本地资源联合建厂的协议，引进西德的先进技术和设备建立地板块厂。他们先后与省内外的三十八家企业联营开发新产品。多种形式的引进联营，为桃山林业局增值二千八百多万元，利润七百八十多万元。
    开展旅游，使桃山人开拓了眼界，深刻体会到增加森林资源是林业企业一切工作的出发点和落脚点，坚定了以营林为基础的思想，更新造林速度加快。开展旅游八年来，更新造林保存面积达四十七万亩，等于建局后十九年造林保存面积的总和。
    旅游还带动了饮食服务业、交通业、旅游商品加工业的蓬勃发展。木耳、人参、松仁、鹿茸、山野菜等土特产品加工业也纷纷兴起。全局呈现出多种经营、百业争辉的喜人局面。
