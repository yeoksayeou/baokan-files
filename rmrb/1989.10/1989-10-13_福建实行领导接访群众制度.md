Fujian Implements Leader Reception System for the Masses

FUZHOU, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- In Fujian, six out of nine prefectures and 71 out of 81 counties have implemented a system where leaders receive visits from the masses. This system has driven a large number of cadres to go deep into the grassroots, connect with the masses, and promptly solve many urgent and difficult problems, thereby building a bridge of close contact between cadres and the masses.

In Ningde, the system of "Regional Committee members taking turns to invite visits from the masses" and "regional and county-level leaders receiving visits from the masses on designated days" has been implemented. Leaders from the Regional Committee and the Regional Government take turns each month to visit various cities and counties, working with local leaders to receive visits. The long-standing problem of drinking water and irrigation for farmers in Changlu Village, Xiapu County, and the long-delayed policy implementation issue for a couple in Gutian County, were both resolved through on-site office meetings. The resolution of these issues not only demonstrated the leaders' practical and down-to-earth work style but also enhanced mutual trust and understanding between cadres and the masses.

In Nanping, after a company implemented a lease-hold and contract system, the contractor acted independently without consulting the workers' congress; in San Yuan District, some village cadres embezzled public funds and property, and illegal logging occurred in Shuikou... Such problems, once discovered during visits, were immediately addressed by local leaders, who also proposed solutions to prevent similar issues from arising, thereby promoting reform, opening up, and clean governance.

During the May-June turmoil, many prefecture and county leaders received visits from the masses, conducted face-to-face consultations, and did a lot of work to stabilize the situation. The leaders of Sanming City and relevant departments conducted extensive consultations with the masses, patiently addressing the thoughts of students preparing to protest, which played a significant role in stabilizing the city's situation. Throughout the turmoil, no students, workers, or citizens in the city took to the streets.

The reason why the leader reception system at the provincial, prefecture, county, and township levels in Fujian has been able to persist and expand is due to the leaders' attention and personal involvement, as well as the practical and feasible methods explored in practice. There are reception schedules, a leadership responsibility system, fixed reception venues, and standardized procedures such as reception registration books, handling slips, completion slips, and personal files. There are also follow-up visits and inspections to ensure implementation.

    福建实行领导接访群众制度
    本报福州讯　记者张铭清报道：在福建9个地市、81个县区中，已有6个地市、71个县区，实行了领导接访群众制度。这种制度推动了大批干部深入基层、联系群众，及时解决了群众中大量的急、难问题，在干部群众之间架起了密切联系的桥梁。
    宁德地区实行“地委委员轮流约访群众”和“地县两级领导接待群众来访日”，地委、行署领导逐月轮流到各市县和当地领导联合接访。霞浦县长芦村农民饮水、灌溉的老大难问题，古田县一对夫妇落实政策中久拖不决的问题，通过现场办公得到了解决。这类问题的解决，不仅体现了领导扎扎实实办事的作风，还增进了干群的信任、理解。
    南平一家企业实行租赁承包后，承包者撇开职代会自行其是；三元区一些村干部侵占公款公物，水口发生乱砍滥伐……这类问题在接访中一旦发现，当地领导不但立即采取措施加以纠正，还举一反三，提出解决面上出现此类问题的办法，推动了改革开放和廉政建设。
    在5、6月动乱期间，许多地市县领导通过接待群众来访，开展面对面的协商对话，做了大量稳定局势的工作。三明市领导和有关部门与群众广泛开展协商对话，耐心做一些准备上街游行的学生的思想工作，对稳定全市局势起了重大作用。全市在动乱期间没有学生、工人和市民上街游行。
    福建省地市县乡各级领导接访制度之所以能够坚持和推开，一是由于领导重视，身体力行，二是由于在实践中摸索出切实可行的办法，有接待时间表，有领导责任制保证，有固定接待场所，有接待登记本、批办单、办结单、人头档案等规范程序，有回访、检查落实等。
