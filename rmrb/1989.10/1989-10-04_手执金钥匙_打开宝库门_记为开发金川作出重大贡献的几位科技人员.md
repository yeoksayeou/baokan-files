Twenty years ago, Gansu's Jinchuan was a sparsely populated, wind-swept expanse of desert. Today, it stands as a city of towering buildings and bustling factories, rivaling Canada's Sudbury, the world's largest nickel mine, and has become China's largest nickel-producing city.

In 1988, Jinchuan produced 200,000 tons of nickel, accounting for over 80% of China's total nickel production. It also produced over 300 tons of cobalt, over 500 kilograms of platinum group metals, over 10,000 tons of copper, and over 100,000 tons of sulfuric acid. Its annual total output value has exceeded 650 million yuan.

Twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye. What force transformed this once-forgotten land into such a brilliant jewel, radiating dazzling light? It was the scientists and engineers who opened Jinchuan's treasure vault; it was science and technology that propelled Jinchuan's leap forward.

The First Furnace of Nickel

Scientists and engineers opened Jinchuan's treasure vault; science and technology propelled Jinchuan's leap forward.

It was 1958. Certain major powers declared that China was a nickel-poor country, lacking both resources and technology. They then listed nickel as a banned export item, aiming to suppress China's alloy steel production and hinder the development of China's military, machinery manufacturing, and chemical industries.

China did not yield. With patriotic confidence, China's vast geological survey teams braved the elements, traversing the western regions, exploring and searching. Guided by a mere walnut-sized sample of ore, they discovered, with the magical power of science as described in "A Thousand and One Nights," a massive polymetallic nickel deposit in Jinchuan: the entire mining area spans approximately 6.5 kilometers, with metal reserves of 5.45 million tons of nickel, 3.43 million tons of copper, and substantial amounts of cobalt, platinum, palladium, gold, silver, and sulfur. Among the world's similar mines, Jinchuan's nickel reserves rank second.

The news spread through the airwaves, reaching Beijing and the rest of the country. The scientists and engineers were overjoyed. Wang Deyong, a researcher from the Beijing Nonferrous Metals Research Institute, was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. Indeed, this young man from a humble background had always relied on state scholarships to study. After graduating from the Shenyang Nonferrous Metals Industry School and entering the workforce, he yearned to make a name for himself in the field of nonferrous metallurgy and repay his country. When he received orders to participate in the construction of the Jinchuan nickel base, he didn't hesitate. He packed his simple belongings, bid farewell to the comforts of Beijing, and arrived in China's vast northwest in 1959, becoming one of the first pioneers of the Jinchuan nickel base. At that time, the country was facing three years of natural disasters, and Jinchuan was still a desert wasteland, not even marked on the map. Life was extremely difficult. On this desolate land, they found three sacks of straw, using one to cover the window, another as a door curtain, and the third as a bed. Each month, they received 24 pounds of coarse grain, eating qingke barley and beans, which were so rough that they were hard to swallow. There were no vegetables, and the only thing they had to eat with their meals was salt. When the bread ran out and they were starving, they would fill their stomachs with bitter and astringent camel grass, eventually developing edema.

Difficulties are like a giant grindstone, sharpening Wang Deyong's will. He remained steadfast, determined to extract the precious and rare nickel from the ore and quickly alleviate the country's urgent need for nickel and cobalt.

With no references, he translated what little foreign literature he could find; with no experience, he experimented and explored. Finally, he and other engineering and technical personnel used outdated blast furnace smelting technology to produce Jinchuan's first furnace of nickel in November 1963, ending China's history of not being able to produce nickel.

The first victory spurred Wang Deyong to greater heights. He immediately threw himself into the technical transformation of electric furnaces, enduring the 60-degree heat and toxic gases that could cause unconsciousness after the furnace was shut down, working with other engineering and technical personnel to collect firsthand data and build the country's first fully enclosed electric furnace. This significantly improved the production and quality of nickel. He also led the industrial trial to reduce the nickel content in the slag of blast furnaces, achieving a satisfactory result of reducing the nickel content in the slag to below 0.15%. He conducted trials to reduce the smelting rate, lowering it from 27% to 17%. He also improved the structure of blast furnaces, achieving waste heat utilization. In just a few years, he created significant economic benefits for Jinchuan's nickel production through technological means.

The "Cultural Revolution" threw Wang Deyong into the depths of political turmoil. Despite enduring humiliation, he remained steadfast in his beliefs, continuing to selflessly dedicate himself to the country's nickel industry. He wrote papers, translated materials, and conducted technical transformations of electric furnaces. He was the first in the country to complete an industrial trial of large-scale electric furnace electrode roasting, researching and selecting the best sealing compound, and transforming the electric furnace structure to achieve a sealed furnace top, significantly reducing metal loss.

Digging Through Difficult Strata

Although Jinchuan has risen on the horizon, the mine is located at the junction of the Qilian Mountains on the northern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the ancient Alxa Plateau, with a complex rock composition, fractures everywhere, and deeply buried ore bodies. Thus, a serious problem—slow tunnel excavation speed—has been hindering Jinchuan's development. At that time, someone described the excavation speed as "one finger per month, one fist per year." The completed tunnels quickly deformed and needed repairs. An internationally renowned scholar remarked, "I've worked in geology for decades and have never seen such a fractured geological structure as Jinchuan's."

Faced with this formidable obstacle, what should be done?

In 1978, at the first "Jinchuan Resource Comprehensive Utilization Science and Technology Work" conference, "Jinchuan Mine Area Rock Mechanics Research" was listed as one of the most important topics.

Under the guidance of renowned domestic rock mechanics expert Professor Chen Zongji, Senior Engineer Tian Yongchuan bravely took on the responsibility of conducting on-site experimental work. In the Jinchuan mine area, he drilled tunnels, climbed steep slopes, carried drilling machines, and dug soil, day after day, month after month, collecting a large amount of firsthand data to study the complex geological conditions of the Jinchuan mine area. Even when he went abroad for inspections, he voluntarily gave up a bit of rest time to visit mine areas similar to Jinchuan's topography.

Diligent exploration bore the fruits of scientific discovery. He and other engineering and technical personnel in the project team combined advanced domestic and international rock mechanics theories with the actual conditions of the Jinchuan mine area, proposing a set of rock stability analysis and control methods suitable for the Jinchuan mine area. This involved studying the unique rock structure of Jinchuan, combining its deformation characteristics, mechanical parameters, stress conditions, and failure mechanisms, successfully mastering the laws of activity in the Jinchuan region, finding methods for predicting engineering geology, and proposing measures for controlling ground pressure. This became a guide for Jinchuan mine construction, marking the entry of Jinchuan mine area engineering geology and rock mechanics research into a new stage, reaching international advanced levels.

Science and technology breakthroughs were like a thousand horses galloping. Soon, other scientific and technological personnel jointly researched and developed "Jinchuan Mine Area Original Rock Stress Measurement and Structural Stress Field Research," "Jinchuan Poor Rock Layer Tunnel Surrounding Rock Deformation Control and Shotcrete Support Technology," "Mechanized Downward Layered Horizontal Access Development and Backfilling Mining Method," and "Large Hole Spherical Charge Retreat Mining Method," among other major scientific research achievements that reached domestic and international advanced levels. This broke through the difficulty of underground tunnel support, accelerated the progress of mine excavation projects, and improved the level of mechanized operations in the mine. The doors to Jinchuan's mineral resources were truly opened, and the precious gems that had slept for millions of years in the deep strata sparkled under the sun, leaping into the hands of miners and gathering in the brilliant sunlight.

The Miracle of Wisdom and Perseverance

Jinchuan Company's nickel smelting production is the final stage of the integrated production system of mining, smelting, and refining, and is the cradle where more than ten precious nonferrous metals contained in Jinchuan nickel ore are born. The mined ore, after being finely ground and selected by the beneficiation process to remove impurities and become concentrate, undergoes pyrometallurgical processes such as smelting, blowing, and casting, and hydrometallurgical processes such as electrolysis, finally separating and revealing their true forms.

However, the smelting production process is complex, with many procedures, and technological progress in each procedure directly affects the recovery of various metals and the company's economic benefits.

Most of Jinchuan's scientific and technological joint attack projects were launched at this "bottleneck." Among them, the most notable major scientific research achievement was the "High pH and High Current Density Industrial Trial of Sulfide Nickel Anode Electrolysis."

Jinchuan Company's nickel electrolysis production system was built and put into operation in 1966, using sulfide nickel anode diaphragm electrolysis and three-stage purification technology, with a designed annual production capacity of 100,000 tons. After 1978, with the breakthrough in mine production, increased output, and the urgent need for domestic construction, higher requirements were placed on nickel metal production: to increase the production capacity of electrolytic nickel through scientific and technological means without increasing capital investment.

Facing the difficulties, a middle-aged "heroine" bravely took on this major scientific research task.

She is Yang Yuhua, a renowned expert in the domestic nickel production industry and the chief engineer of Jinchuan Company's smelting plant.

Yang Yuhua graduated from the Shenyang Nonferrous Metals Industry School in 1956 and came to Jinchuan, which was then a desert, in 1960. Over the years, she has experienced the entire process of Jinchuan nickel mine's arduous pioneering efforts, establishing meritorious service. As early as the initial production of the first batch of electrolytic nickel at Jinchuan Company, her hard work and sweat were already present. With the continuous expansion of Jinchuan Company's production scale, she specialized in wet process production technology, dissolving the nickel and copper anode plates produced by pyrometallurgy into the electrolyte, using diaphragm electrolysis and three-stage continuous purification technology to remove impurities, and producing electrolytic nickel with a nickel content of 99.97% and electrolytic copper with a copper content of 99.96%, among other final products.

Now, when she took on the task of increasing the original design production capacity of the nickel electrolysis workshop to 200,000 tons per year without expanding the factory and adding large equipment, the task was indeed arduous!

She consulted the literature and found that only by increasing the pH (acidity) of the electrolyte and the current density in nickel electrolysis production could the production be significantly increased. However, this scheme was only seen in scattered foreign literature, and domestic trials were unprecedented. How high should the pH of the electrolyte and the current density be to both maintain quality and increase production?

She wandered in the maze of science, staying up all night to formulate plans. The first experiment failed. Due to the inability to control the appropriate temperature and dosage, the nickel plates extracted from the test tank were covered with large and small bumps caused by hydrogen bubbles, commonly known as "toad skin," which were both ugly and reduced the purity of the electrolytic nickel, attracting some sarcastic remarks.

Undeterred, she started everything from scratch, exploring everything anew. In later experiments, she changed the original plan's gradual design, doing the opposite, starting with high pH and high current density from the beginning.

One experiment after another...

One set of data after another...

Success! She finally succeeded. She used two titanium tube heaters to raise the temperature of the molten hole from the original 50°C to 65°C, first solving the technical difficulty of nickel growth pores, and after days and nights of hard work, finally researched the optimal process technology for high pH and high current density. Under the condition of not expanding the factory and adding large equipment, the production capacity of the nickel electrolysis workshop indeed increased from 100,000 tons to 200,000 tons, thus opening up a new path of short cycle, less investment, quick results, high benefits, relying on technological progress, and relying on the internal development of the enterprise to produce.

Jinchuan, this Jinchuan that relies on science and technology to open the underground treasure vault, this Jinchuan that relies on science and technology to make rapid progress, has achieved 99 scientific and technological achievements in its development process through joint attacks, of which 78 have won provincial and ministerial-level awards, 72 have been applied to actual production, and 9 have reached international advanced levels. According to statistics, in the past 11 years, the economic benefits increased by science and technology alone amounted to 800 million yuan, accounting for 44.51% of the profits and taxes realized in the same period. Therefore, after they read and defended the "Jinchuan Resource Development and Comprehensive Utilization" scientific research achievements, which summarized the entire development of Jinchuan science and technology, at the 1989 National Science and Technology Progress Award Review Committee, they immediately won the high praise of the attending experts and scholars, and the "Special Award" of the National Science and Technology Progress was bestowed upon the vast number of scientific and technological personnel of Jinchuan, in recognition of their enormous contributions to the country's nickel industry.

    手执金钥匙　打开宝库门
    ——记为开发金川作出重大贡献的几位科技人员
    本报记者　何黄彪
    20年前，甘肃金川还是人烟稀少、风沙肆虐的茫茫戈壁；如今，已是高楼林立、厂房栉比，成为堪与号称世界第一大镍矿的加拿大萨特伯里相媲美的我国最大的镍都。
    1988年，它年产镍2万吨，占我国镍总产量的80％以上，年产钴300多吨，铂族500多公斤，铜1万多吨，硫酸10万多吨。其年总产值已经突破6.5亿元。
    20年岁月，弹指一挥间。是什么力量使这片几乎被人遗忘的土地骤然变成了这样一颗璀璨的明珠，放射出绚丽夺目的光彩？！
    第一炉镍是怎样炼成的
    科技人员打开了金川的宝库；科学技术使金川飞跃。
    那是1958年，某些大国断言中国是个贫镍国，一无资源，二无技术，于是，他们就把镍列为禁运商品，想以此来遏制中国的合金钢生产，从而影响我军工、机械制造、化学工业等部门的发展。
    不屈服，不信邪，具有爱国自信心的我国广大地质队的科技人员，餐风宿露，转辗西北，跋涉呀，探索呀，终于在仅有一块核桃大的矿石标本引导下，以《天方夜谭》中阿里巴巴芝麻开门的科学魔力，在金川境内发现了这么一座多金属伴生的特大型镍矿床：整个矿区长约6.5公里，金属储量为545万吨，铜343万吨，还有大量的钴、铂、钯、金、银、硫。其中镍储量在世界同类矿中名列第二位。
    喜讯通过电波，传到了北京，传遍了全国。这下，可把科技人员乐坏了。北京有色金属研究院的科研工作者王德雍获知这个消息后，激动得彻夜难眠。是啊，这个家境贫寒的青年，解放后一直是靠公费上学的，心里倍感共和国的温暖。当他从沈阳有色金属工业学校毕业、走向工作岗位后，更是想在有色冶金领域里大显身手，报效祖国。当他一接到调令，要他去参加金川镍基地的建设，二话不说，背起简单的行李，告别了舒适的北京，满怀豪情于1959年来到祖国的大西北，成为金川镍基地的首批开拓者。当时，国家正遭到三年自然灾害，金川还是一片戈壁荒滩，在地图上连个名字都没有标上，生活更是十分艰苦。他们在这个“大漠孤烟直”的荒僻土地上，找来三个草袋，一个遮窗户，一个作门帘，一个当床铺，住在四面漏风的地窝里。每月24斤粗粮，吃的是青稞、豆面，粗糙得难以下咽，没有蔬菜，唯一用来下饭的就是咸盐。馍馍吃完了，实在饿得慌，就用那又苦又涩的骆驼草填肚子，最后患了浮肿病。
    困难，是一块巨大的磨刀石，在磨砺着王德雍的意志。他没有丝毫动摇，一心想的就是如何把珍贵而稀少的镍从矿石中提炼出来，尽快改变国家缺镍少钴的紧迫状况。
    没有资料，他从有限的国外资料中一点点翻译；没有经验，他在一次次实验中探索攻关。终于，他与其他工程技术人员一道，运用老掉牙的鼓风炉熔炼技术，于1963年11月从铜镍矿中生产出了金川的第一炉镍，从而结束了我国不能生产镍的历史。
    首战告捷，使王德雍更加鼓荡起前进的风帆。他又马不停蹄地投入了热电炉的技术改造，冒着停炉后仍然高达60度的高温和随时可致人昏迷的有毒气体的熏呛，与其他工程技术人员一道，轮流钻进炉膛内，取得了第一手资料，建成了国内第一台全密矿热电炉，从而使生产镍的产品和质量大幅度提高。他还主持了鼓风炉降低渣含镍的工业试验，取得了渣含镍降低到0.15％以下的可喜成绩；他进行降低冶焦率试验，使冶炼焦率从27％降到了17％；他又改进了鼓风炉的结构，实现了废热利用。短短几年，他通过科技手段，为金川的镍生产创造了重大的经济效益。
    “十年动乱”把王德雍打入了政治的最底层。他在忍辱负重中，信念不渝，仍然默默地为着祖国的镍事业进行无私的奉献。他撰写论文，翻译资料，进行矿热电炉技术改造，在国内首次完成大型矿热炉电极焙烧的工业试验，研究筛选最佳密闭糊的成份，改造电炉炉体结构实现密封炉顶，从而大大减少了金属的损失。
    在困难的地层中掘进
    金川虽然在地平线上崛起了，但是，由于这座矿床位于青藏高原北缘隆起的祁连山脉与古老的阿拉善台地的交汇处，岩石构成十分复杂，断裂带到处分布，岩石破碎，矿体埋藏很深。于是，一个严重的问题——巷道掘进速度在阻碍着金川的发展。当时有人形容掘进速度是“一月一指头，一年一拳头”，建好的巷道很快又发生变形而需要返修。一位国际知名学者感慨地说：“我干了几十年地质工作，从来没有见过像金川这样破碎的地质构造。”
    面对这只凶狠的拦路虎，怎么办？
    1978年，在第一次召开的“金川资源综合利用科技工作”会议上，把“金川矿区岩石力学研究”列入了最重要的课题。
    高级工程师田永川在国内著名岩石力学专家陈宗基教授的指导下，勇敢地挑起了负责现场试验工作的重担。他在金川矿区钻巷道、爬陡坡、抬钻机、挖土方，日复一日，月复一月，为研究复杂的金川矿区地质情况取得了大量的第一手资料。就连出国考察之时，他也主动放弃转道他国的一点点休息时间，奔往与金川地貌相似的矿区考察。
    辛勤的探索，催开了鲜艳的科学之花。他与课题组其他工程技术人员一起，把国内外先进的岩石力学理论与金川矿区的实际情况结合起来，提出了一套适合金川矿区岩体稳定性分析及其控制法，这就是以研究金川特殊的岩体结构为核心，结合其变形特征、力学参数、受力条件及破坏机制，成功地掌握了金川地区活动的规律，找到了预报工程地质的方法，提出了地压控制措施，成为金川矿山建设的指南，标志着金川矿区工程地质和岩石力学的研究进入了一个全新的阶段，达到了国际领先水平。
    科技攻关，万马奔腾。不久，其他科技人员联合研究的《金川矿区原岩应力测量和构造应力场的研究》、《金川不良岩层巷道围岩变形控制与喷锚支护技术》、《机械化下向分层水平进路胶结充填采矿法》、《大孔球状药包后退式采矿法》等具有国内外先进水平的重大科研成果相继问世。从而突破了井下巷道支护难关，加快了矿山掘进工程进度，提高了矿山机械化作业程度。金川矿藏的大门真正被打开了，那些在地层深处沉睡了亿万年之久的宝石，闪着幽幽的光泽，经过矿山工人之手，纷纷跃出，齐集在灿烂的阳光之下。
    智慧与毅力的奇迹
    金川公司的镍冶炼生产，是整个采、造、冶联合生产系统工程的最后一站，也是金川镍矿中所含10多种珍贵有色金属诞生之摇篮。从地下开采出来的矿岩，经过选矿工艺的细磨精选，排除杂质，化作精矿，在这里通过以熔炼、吹炼、熔铸为主的火法生产工艺和以电解为主的湿法生产工艺，最终分化，显示出它们各自的“庐山真面目”。
    然而，冶炼生产环节众多，工艺复杂，每道工序的技术进步，都直接影响到各类金属的回收与公司的经济效益。
    金川科技联合攻关的大部分项目，都在这个“颈口”上展开。其中最引人注目的重大科研成果就是“硫化镍阳极电解高PH值高电流密度工业试验”。
    金川公司的镍电解生产系统，建成投产于1966年，采用的是硫化镍阳极隔膜电解和三段净化工艺，设计年生产规模为1万吨。1978年以后，随着矿山生产的突破、出矿量的增加和国内建设的急需，对镍金属的生产也提出了更高的要求：要在不增加基建投资的情况下，通过科学技术手段，大幅度地提高电解镍的生产能力。
    直面困难，挺身而出，一位中年“巾帼英雄”勇敢地承担了这项重大的科研任务。
    她，就是在国内镍生产领域享有盛誉的女专家、金川公司冶炼厂总工程师杨郁华。
    杨郁华，于1956年毕业于沈阳有色金属工业学校，1960年来到当时还是一片戈壁的金川。岁月流逝，她在酸甜苦辣中经历了金川镍矿艰苦创业的全过程，立下了功勋。早在金川公司建厂初期生产的第一批电解镍中，就凝聚了她的辛劳和汗水。随着金川公司生产规模的不断扩大，她专攻湿法生产工艺，把火法冶炼中生产出的镍、铜阳极板浸入电解液中，采用隔膜电解及三段连续净化工艺，除去杂质，生产出了含镍量99.97％的电解镍和含铜量99.96％的电解铜等最终产品。
    现在，当她承担了要在不扩建厂房和不增加大型设备的前提下，使镍电解车间原设计生产能力翻番，达到年产2万吨电解镍的科研项目，其任务是何等艰巨啊！
    她查阅资料，只有在电镍生产中提高阴板液PH（酸）值和提高电流密度的方法才能使生产大幅度提高。但这种方案仅见于国外的零星资料，国内试验尚属首次。究竟把电解液PH值和电流密度提高到多少才能既不影响质量又提高了产量呢？
    她神游在科学的迷宫里，通宵达旦在制定着方案。第一次实验失败了。由于掌握不了合适的温度、用量等，从试验槽中提炼出的镍板上布满了大大小小由氢气泡造成的疙瘩，俗称“蛤蟆皮”，又难看又降低了电镍品级率，由此招来了一些人的风凉话。
    不服输，不气馁，顶着上！她一切从头开始，一切重新探索，在后来的实验中，她改变原方案循序渐进的设计，反其道而行之，实验之初就从高PH值、高电流密度做起。
    一次试验，又一次试验……
    一批数据，又一批数据……
    成功了！她终于成功了。她用两台钛管加热器，将熔孔的温度从原来50℃提高到65℃，首先解决了电镍生长气孔这一技术上的难关，又经过日日夜夜奋战，终于研究出了高PH值、高电流密度最优的工艺技术，在不扩建厂房和不增加大型设备的条件下，果然使镍电解车间的生产能力由1万吨奇迹般地上升为2万吨，从而闯出了一条周期短、投资少、见效快、效益高、依靠科技进步、依靠企业内涵发展生产的新路子。
    金川，这个依靠科学技术打开地下宝库的金川，这个靠了科学技术使之突飞猛进的金川，在它前进的历程中，经过联合攻关，共取得99项科技成果，其中有78项获省、部级以上奖励，有72项成果应用于生产实际，有9项成果达到国际先进水平。据统计，11年来，纯属科技进步增加的经济效益为8亿元，占同期实现利税的44.51％。因此，当他们把概括整个金川科技发展的“金川资源开发与综合利用”科研成果在1989年国家科技进步奖评审委员会宣读和答辩后，立即博得了与会专家学者的高度赞扬，并把国家科技进步“特等奖”的桂冠授予了金川广大的科技人员，以表彰他们为共和国的镍事业所作出的巨大贡献。
