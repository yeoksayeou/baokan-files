North and South Korea to Resume Sports Talks

The head of the North Korean delegation to the inter-Korean sports talks, Kim Hyong-jin, notified the chief representative of the South Korean delegation, Chang Chung-shik, on October 16 that the North agrees to hold the third round of inter-Korean sports talks on October 20 at Panmunjom.

The talks were originally scheduled for July 18 but were indefinitely postponed by the South for unjustified reasons. It was only recently that South Korea proposed resuming the talks on October 20.

    朝鲜北南将恢复体育会谈
    朝鲜北南体育会谈北方代表团团长金亨镇十月十六日通知南方代表团首席代表张忠植，北方同意于本月二十日在板门店举行第三次朝鲜北南体育会谈。
    会谈原定于七月十八日举行，但南方以不正当理由将之无限期推迟。直到不久前，南朝鲜才提出于十月二十日恢复会谈。
