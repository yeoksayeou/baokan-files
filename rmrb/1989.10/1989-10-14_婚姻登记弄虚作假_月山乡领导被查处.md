Edition: 6

	Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on March 25, on the sixth page, titled "Marriage Registration Fraud in Yueshan Township." After receiving the letter, the county's disciplinary committee and supervisory bureau have seriously investigated and punished the relevant responsible parties involved in the incident:

	The Party Committee Secretary, Chen Kezhi, failed to properly fulfill his supervisory duties and even helped his son and son-in-law, who were not of legal marriage age, obtain marriage certificates. He received a Party warning. The township head, Luo Guangpu, helped his son, who was not of legal marriage age, obtain a marriage certificate and instructed the marriage registrar to increase the ages of his three children on their household registration books. He received a Party severe warning and a major demerit in his administrative record. The marriage registrar, Jing Zhaojun, arbitrarily issued marriage certificates to more than 40 couples who were not of legal marriage age and altered the birth dates on other people's household registration books. He received a one-year Party probation and was dismissed from his administrative post but retained on the payroll for one year.

    婚姻登记弄虚作假　月山乡领导被查处
    你报3月25日第六版刊登《月山乡婚姻登记中弄虚作假》的读者来信后，县纪委、县监察局已对这起事件中的有关责任人员进行了严肃处理：党委书记陈克志，不认真履行监督职能，还为不到法定婚龄的儿子和女婿办理了结婚证书，受到党内警告处分。乡长罗光普给不到法定婚龄的儿子办理了结婚证书，又授意婚姻登记员为自己3个孩子改大了户口簿上的年龄，受到党内严重警告、行政记大过处分。婚姻登记员景朝俊擅自办理了40多对不到法定婚龄青年的结婚证书，为他人涂改户口簿上的出生年月，给予留党察看一年、行政开除留用一年的处分。
