Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 7th — The national conference on military-civilian integration in the defense science and technology industry, held in Beijing today, emphasized the need to strengthen military-civilian coordination, overcome difficulties, tap into potential, and ensure the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the entire defense science and technology industry.

The conference was approved by the State Council and jointly organized by the State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, and the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. The conference noted that the product and industrial structure of defense enterprises have undergone significant changes, with civilian product output now accounting for 66% of the total industrial output. While fulfilling military product tasks, the defense sector has actively undertaken a number of key national projects, such as the electron-positron collider, filling gaps in China's scientific and technological fields and reaching advanced world levels in some areas.

The conference acknowledged that defense enterprises currently face several challenges: the development of military-civilian integration is uneven across the country; some civilian products are experiencing sluggish sales and severe backlogs, affecting normal production operations and leading to a decline in enterprise economic efficiency; and there are shortages of funds, energy, and raw materials. However, it is also necessary to recognize that the ongoing economic restructuring has brought opportunities and prospects for the development of military-civilian integration. Defense enterprises should uphold the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, strengthen cooperation, further enhance military-civilian coordination, adjust product and industrial structures, fully tap into defense potential, and open up new prospects for military-civilian integration.

    国防科技工业军民结合工作会议强调
    军民统筹　稳定发展
    据新华社北京10月7日电（记者许志敏）今天在京召开的全国国防科技工业军民结合工作会议强调，加强军民统筹，克服困难，挖掘潜力，保证整个国防科技工业持续、稳定和协调地发展。
    这次会议是经国务院批准，由国家计委、国家科委和国防科工委联合召开的。会议认为，军工企业的产品和产业结构已发生明显变化，目前民品产值已占工业总产值的66％。在完成军品任务的前提下，军工部门积极承担了电子对撞机等一批国家重点项目，有的填补了我国科技领域空白和达到世界先进水平。
    会议认为，当前军工企业面临的困难是：全国军民结合的发展还不平衡；一些民用产品滞销，积压严重，影响了生产的正常运转，企业经济效益下降；资金、能源、原材料紧缺等。但也必须看到，治理整顿同时也给军民结合的发展带来了希望和机遇，军工企业要发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，大力协同，进一步加强军民统筹，搞好产品和产业结构的调整，充分挖掘军工潜力，开拓军民结合的新局面。
