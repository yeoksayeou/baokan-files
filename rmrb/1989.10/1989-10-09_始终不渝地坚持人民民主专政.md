The turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital, Beijing, have provided us with profound and multifaceted lessons. One of the most important lessons is that the concept of people's democratic dictatorship has faded in the minds of many people over the past few years. Reflecting calmly on the past and contemplating the future, we deeply feel that it is of great practical significance and far-reaching historical importance to re-learn and fully grasp the Party's theory of people's democratic dictatorship and to persistently uphold it.

I. Historical Choice, Fundamental Experience

Upholding people's democratic dictatorship is an indispensable part of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles.

Why should we uphold people's democratic dictatorship? The simplest answer is: people's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental system of our country. The first article of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the First Session of the First National People's Congress in 1954, clearly states: The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. The first article of the revised Constitution adopted by the Fifth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress in 1982 also clearly states: The People's Republic of China is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. This fact shows that the socialist state under people's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental system of our country, and any organization or individual that undermines this system is in violation of the Constitution.

Looking back at history, in our country, the establishment of the socialist republic under people's democratic dictatorship was not arbitrary, and the establishment of this system was not easy. After the Opium War, China was invaded by imperialist powers, gradually becoming a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society, and the people lived in misery. To seek a way to save the nation and strengthen the country, progressive Chinese people at that time mainly studied new ideas from the West. In terms of state institutions, Kang Youwei hoped to establish a constitutional monarchy without fundamentally changing the feudal monarchy, but this plan quickly failed. The great forerunner of the bourgeois democratic revolution, Sun Yat-sen, proposed a complete revolutionary program, including the implementation of a "three-power separation" system, aiming to establish a bourgeois democratic republic, and fought hard to achieve this goal. The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China, but the political system they introduced from the West was completely transformed in China. When Yuan Shikai and the Beiyang warlords gained power, the bourgeois republic became a fake republic. Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause. Although he hung the sign of a bourgeois republic, he actually implemented fascist dictatorship. This was the failure of bourgeois democracy and the bourgeois republic in China.

The victory of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China. The Chinese democratic revolution had a new turning point, transforming from an old democratic revolution to a new democratic revolution. Led by the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, after 28 years of arduous struggle, including 22 years of armed struggle, with millions of people sacrificing their lives, finally overthrew the rule of the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and established the People's Republic under people's democratic dictatorship. A century of tortuous history shows that China could not choose the path of a bourgeois republic, and the only correct choice was to establish a republic under people's democratic dictatorship. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Summing up our experience, concentrating on one point, is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. This dictatorship must be united with the international revolutionary forces. This is our formula, this is our main experience, this is our main program." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, p. 1485)

In the new historical period, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in response to the bourgeois liberalization trend that denies the Four Cardinal Principles, pointed out: "Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, we would not be able to defend and build socialism." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 155) The 40-year practice of the people's democratic dictatorship in our country also proves: only by upholding the people's democratic dictatorship can there be a strong country, social stability, economic development, protection of people's rights, improvement of people's lives, and enhancement of our country's international status. History and reality, experience and lessons all tell us that the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of our country. Upholding the people's democratic dictatorship provides a reliable guarantee and important support for us to uphold the socialist path, uphold the leadership of the Communist Party, and uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Upholding the people's democratic dictatorship is our fundamental experience. Without this, there would be no position for the people, no independence for the People's Republic, and no prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern country.

II. A New Type of Dictatorship, A New Type of Democracy

Our country is a socialist state under people's democratic dictatorship. People's democratic dictatorship is a combination of democracy within the people and dictatorship over the enemy, a combination of new-type democracy and new-type dictatorship. Although the bourgeois state claims "sovereignty of the people," in reality, it is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, that is, a dictatorship over the majority, with a few enjoying democracy, and a dictatorship over the working class and the broad laboring people, with a few bourgeois exploiters enjoying democracy. The dictatorship of the proletariat, in our country, is the people's democratic dictatorship, which for the first time in history makes the working class and other laboring people the masters of the state. It is the opposite of all exploiting class states in nature, where the working class and the broad laboring people enjoy democracy, while a few exploiters are subjected to dictatorship and ruled.

Dictatorship and democracy are dialectically unified. On the one hand, dictatorship and democracy have fundamental differences, and their objects, scope, and methods are different. If the two are confused, it will be difficult to distinguish or even reverse the two different types of contradictions, damaging the people's democratic dictatorship. On the other hand, dictatorship and democracy are closely linked. First, dictatorship and democracy are two aspects of the same problem. Any democratic state is a combination of the democracy of a certain class and the dictatorship over a certain class, a unity of democracy and dictatorship. The ruling class that holds state power not only insists on dictatorship over the opposing class to deal with the resistance of the ruled class but also insists on a certain form of democracy within its own class to adjust the contradictions within the ruling class, organize its own forces, and then impose dictatorship on the ruled class. The bourgeois democratic system is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; the proletarian democratic system is the dictatorship of the proletariat. Second, dictatorship and democracy are interdependent, mutually guaranteed, and complementary. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "The people's democracy and the dictatorship over the enemy are inseparable." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 161) Only by striving to expand democracy, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people, and enabling them to exercise their right to be masters of the country, can the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship have a solid foundation and a powerful force, and effectively impose dictatorship on the enemy and punish lawbreakers. At the same time, only by insisting on dictatorship and resolutely striking down the enemy can the democratic rights of the people be guaranteed. Without dictatorship, democracy loses its premise and guarantee.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is an indispensable protective shield for the proletariat and the broad laboring people, and it has always been attacked and distorted by all hostile forces. Representatives of the bourgeoisie and their scholars always beautify bourgeois democracy as universal democracy, completely denying that it is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; on the other hand, they describe the dictatorship of the proletariat as "undemocratic" and "dictatorial." Since the birth of the dictatorship of the proletariat, from the Paris Commune to the Soviet government and the people's democratic dictatorship in our country, they have all been cursed by domestic and foreign enemies as "dictatorship," "dictatorship," and "tyranny." Lin Biao advocated that "power is the power of suppression," and Zhang Chunqiao spread the idea of "comprehensive dictatorship," both of which only talked about dictatorship, denied democracy, and directed the dictatorship at the Party and the people. In recent years, an illegal organization called "Thaw Society" issued a declaration, openly opposing the people's democratic dictatorship, saying that our insistence on the people's democratic dictatorship is "dividing humanity." In Shanghai, a so-called "democracy discussion group" maliciously said that "the root of all evil is the dictatorship of the proletariat." In this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, the leaders of bourgeois liberalization, those who plot political conspiracies, and the leaders of some illegal organizations worshipped bourgeois democracy, cursed the people's democratic dictatorship as "dictatorship," as a "fascist regime," and slandered the use of the pillar army of the people's democratic dictatorship to impose martial law as a "fascist intimidation tactic"; while they spread rumors, incited trouble, occupied the square, set up barricades, disrupted order, and violated human rights, they claimed it was "democracy."

Within the people, there is also the erroneous idea of separating democracy from dictatorship, which is a matter of ideological understanding. In the eyes of some people, it seems that once democracy is mentioned, the function of dictatorship disappears; once dictatorship is mentioned, it hinders democracy. Some people always equate dictatorship with autocracy. In fact, dictatorship is a matter of state nature, that is, which class is in the dominant position, and autocracy is a matter of state form, that is, the organizational form of state power. Countries that belong to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie have some that adopt a democratic system, some that adopt an autocratic system, with the former being more common. The dictatorship of the proletariat can only adopt a democratic system; otherwise, it will degenerate.

In response to the stubborn insistence of bourgeois liberalization on denying and distorting the people's democratic dictatorship, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed the need to uphold the people's democratic dictatorship. He not only spoke the most, the most resolutely, and the most thoroughly on the issue of upholding dictatorship but also spoke the most, the most thoroughly, and the most profoundly on the issue of developing democracy; he insisted on two-pronged efforts, speaking of dictatorship without forgetting democracy, and speaking of democracy without forgetting dictatorship. He believed that as a socialist democracy that unifies new-type democracy and new-type dictatorship, it must insist on the unity of democracy and dictatorship, the unity of democracy and centralization, the unity of democracy and legal system, the unity of freedom and discipline, the unity of rights and obligations, and the unity of people's democracy and the Party's leadership. Only in this way can socialist democracy be strictly distinguished from bourgeois democracy and individualistic democracy, and the serious spread of extremist democracy and anarchism be prevented.

For socialism, the more essential thing is democracy. This is because, under socialist conditions, the laboring people jointly enjoy different forms of ownership and control over the means of production, and on this basis, they must realize the right to manage state affairs, economy, culture, and other matters, that is, they must develop democracy. Socialism is superior to capitalism, and socialism is ruled by the people, not only in the economic field but also in the fields of ideology, culture, and politics; not only in being able to develop the productive forces faster and increasingly meet the material and cultural needs of the people but also in having a higher and more realistic democracy. Without democracy, there is no socialism. It is democracy that is the true essence of socialism, that is, socialism is essentially democratic. Lenin repeatedly pointed out: "The essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat is not only violence, but mainly not violence." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 3, p. 857)

"The dictatorship of the proletariat is not only the violence used against the exploiters, and even mainly not violence." (Selected Works of Lenin, Vol. 4, p. 9) Here, the main point is that the dictatorship of the proletariat, as the political power of the proletariat and the laboring people, although it must suppress the resistance of the exploiting class, is more importantly to organize the people to build and develop production and manage the state. Lenin here is still talking about the dictatorship of the proletariat in the transitional period, when the exploiting class has not been eliminated. In the socialist period, the exploiting class has been eliminated, and the essence of the dictatorship of the proletariat should be "mainly not violence." From the overall trend of socialist development, the scope of democracy is increasingly expanding, and the scope of dictatorship is gradually narrowing. The more socialism develops, the more democracy develops. This is undeniable.

III. Dictatorship Must Continue, Democracy Must Expand

In our country, although the exploiting class has been eliminated and class struggle is no longer the main contradiction, dictatorship must still be continued. Due to domestic factors and international influences, class struggle will still exist for a certain period and may intensify. This is not something that can be changed by human will. Hostile forces and hostile elements that oppose and sabotage the socialist system, as well as various criminals, degenerate elements, and new exploiters, still exist and must be struck down and stopped in their destructive activities; imperialism and other anti-socialist forces still exist, and their possible invasions and subversive activities must be defended against. This counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital also proves this point. Therefore, the view that "upholding the people's democratic dictatorship has no object" is groundless and harmful in practice. Class struggle has not been extinguished, and the concept of dictatorship must not be weakened. We must be prepared for long-term struggle and insist on the dictatorial function of the people's democratic dictatorship state.

While insisting on continuing dictatorship, we must also strive to expand democracy. In 1956, Comrade Zhou Enlai, based on the characteristics of our country's basic completion of socialist transformation and the elimination of the exploiting class, profoundly pointed out: "Now our people's democratic dictatorship should be: dictatorship must continue, democracy must expand." (Selected Works of Zhou Enlai, Vol. 2, p. 207) He believed that democracy should be expanded not only because the strength of the people's democratic dictatorship and the reduction of the enemy's activities allow it, but also because it is verified by the historical experience of the Soviet Union and our country's entire proletarian dictatorship, therefore, "expanding democracy, this point is more essential in nature." (Ibid.) Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the changes in social contradictions and class contradictions after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of private ownership of the means of production in our country, proposed that the fundamental task is to develop the productive forces, that is, the focus is on economic construction, and correctly handling the contradictions within the people became the general theme of national political life. He also formulated a series of democratic principles for correctly handling the contradictions within the people, and established the correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" for the development of science and culture. He pointed out, in response to some places where strikes and class suspensions occurred at that time, that to prevent such incidents from happening, the fundamental method is to strengthen education and expand democracy. He also pointed out: "Our goal is to create a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and with individual hearts content, lively and vigorous, so as to be conducive to the socialist revolution and socialist construction, to overcome difficulties more easily, and to build our country's modern industry and modern agriculture more quickly. The party and the state will be more consolidated and more able to withstand risks." (The Situation in the Summer of 1957) Unfortunately, due to various complex reasons, there was once an erroneous tendency to expand class struggle, and during the "Cultural Revolution," the state system of people's democratic dictatorship was seriously damaged.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party has correctly summarized the experiences and lessons in upholding the people's democratic dictatorship, and confirmed the principle of "dictatorship must continue, democracy must expand." Comrade Deng Xiaoping, while specially discussing the issue of upholding the dictatorship of the proletariat, also specially discussed the importance of expanding democracy, pointing out: "In the practice of democracy, we have done too little in the past and have made mistakes. Lin Biao and the 'Gang of Four' propagated 'comprehensive dictatorship,' imposing feudal fascist dictatorship on the people, and we have thoroughly smashed this dictatorship. This has nothing in common with the dictatorship of the proletariat and is completely the opposite. Now we have resolutely corrected the mistakes of the past and have taken various measures to continue to strive to expand Party democracy and people's democracy." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 154) In Comrade Deng Xiaoping's many speeches and in some important documents of the Party Central Committee, it has been repeatedly summarized that since the founding of the country, democracy has not been emphasized, and it has been pointed out that "this has become an important condition for the 'Cultural Revolution' to occur, which is a painful lesson." (Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Historical Issues Since the Founding of the Country) "The main historical lessons of the development of socialism in our country are: first, we did not concentrate our efforts on developing the economy; second, we did not actually build democratic politics." (Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the Guiding Principles for the Construction of Socialist Spiritual Civilization)

Currently, the top priority for the whole Party and the people of the whole country is to complete the four tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. We must strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, completely suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and create a stable political situation and social environment for the continued socialist modernization; we must strive to expand democracy, strengthen supervision, punish corruption, and win the trust of the people.

Upholding the dictatorial function of a socialist state, completely suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, is the top political task at present. We have achieved a decisive victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, but we have not yet achieved a complete victory. We are facing a group of enemies who attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and subvert the socialist state power of the people's democratic dictatorship. We must not be lenient with these ruthless enemies. This turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion tell us that the dictatorial function of a socialist state must be upheld and strengthened, and it must not be weakened, let alone abolished. In our country, the institutions that perform the dictatorial function include military organs, judicial organs, procuratorial organs, security organs, and public security organs, that is, the army, police, courts, prisons, and other coercive institutions. It is particularly important to note that the people's army, as the pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship and an important part of the state apparatus, has the dual function of defending against foreign invasions and suppressing the subversive and destructive activities of domestic and foreign hostile forces and hostile elements. We must strive to strengthen the construction of these coercive institutions, so that they gradually achieve the goals of being well-equipped, well-armed, rationally structured, efficient, and strong, and better play their role in maintaining national interests and security.

To strive to expand democracy, we must continue to implement the policies, principles, and requirements for political system reform and strengthening democratic political construction determined by the Thirteenth Congress, and do so in a steady and gradual manner. The current stage of democratic political construction must focus on effectiveness and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the grassroots masses, starting with what can be done, and dedicating efforts to improving basic systems such as the people's congress system. The current democratic political construction must emphasize the resolute punishment of corruption and the strengthening of clean governance. It should be noted that the phenomenon of corruption in Party and government organs is a corrosive agent for the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship. It not only damages the fighting capacity of the Party and the authority of the government, harms the image of the Party and the government in the minds of the people, but also seriously dampens the enthusiasm of the people for socialist modernization. How to punish, prevent, and eradicate corruption? The most important thing is to strengthen democratic construction, expand people's democracy, and ensure the people's right to supervision. Power without supervision leads to corruption. This is even more important for high-level cadres. We must learn from this historical lesson. As early as 1945, when the War of Resistance Against Japan was about to achieve victory, the famous democrat Huang Yanpei asked Comrade Mao Zedong: Can the Communist Party find a new path to break out of this cycle? He asked a thought-provoking question. Mao Zedong replied at the time: "We have already found a new path, we can break out of this cycle. This new path is democracy. Only by letting the people supervise the government can the government not relax. Only when everyone takes responsibility can there be no decline after the loss of a person." These words are still very touching today.

Recently, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's recent speeches, discussed and adopted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Doing a Few Things That the People Care About in the Near Future." This makes the people see that the Party and the government not only have the determination to punish corruption but also have the measures to do so. If these things are done well and real results are achieved, it will certainly boost morale and win the trust of the people. As long as we work hard to promote democratic political construction, improve the supervisory system, ensure the people's right to supervision, insist on the equality of citizens before the law and regulations, and the equality of Party members before the Party Constitution and Party discipline, truly achieve the rule of law, and ensure that the law is enforced strictly and violations are punished, and truly make democracy institutionalized and legalized, we can thoroughly solve the problems of privileges, lawlessness, and corruption, and make the people's democratic dictatorship more consolidated.

    始终不渝地坚持人民民主专政
    钟灿
    在首都北京发生的这场反党反社会主义的动乱和反革命暴乱，教训是深刻的、多方面的。其中很重要的一条，就是这几年人民民主专政观念在很多人的心目中淡化了。冷静地总结过去，思考未来，我们深深感到，重新学习、全面掌握党的人民民主专政理论，始终不渝地把它坚持下去，具有十分重要的现实意义和极其深远的历史意义。
    一、历史的选择，基本的经验
    坚持人民民主专政是坚持四项基本原则不可缺少的重要内容。
    为什么要坚持人民民主专政呢？最简单的回答是：人民民主专政是我们国家的根本制度。1954年一届人大一次会议通过的中华人民共和国第一部宪法第一条明确指出：中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。1982年五届人大五次会议通过的修改后的新宪法第一条也明确指出：中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家。这个事实说明，人民民主专政的社会主义国家是我们国家的根本制度，任何组织或者个人破坏这个制度都是违背宪法的。
    回顾历史，在我们国家，找到人民民主专政的社会主义共和国这个制度不是随心所欲的，建立起这个制度也不是轻而易举的。中国自鸦片战争以后，帝国主义列强纷至沓来，使中国逐渐沦为半封建半殖民地社会，人民生活在水深火热之中。为了寻找救亡图存、兴邦强国的道路，当时求进步的中国人，主要是研究西方的新道理。在国家制度问题上，康有为希望在不根本改变封建君主制度的前提下，建立君主立宪政体的资产阶级国家。这个方案很快破产了。资产阶级民主革命的伟大先行者孙中山，完整地提出了包括实行“三权分立”政体在内的、以建立一个资产阶级民主共和国为目标的革命纲领，并为实现这个纲领进行了艰苦斗争。辛亥革命推翻了清朝统治，产生了中华民国，但是他们从西方引进来的一套政治制度在中国却完全变了样，待到袁世凯为代表的北洋军阀得势，资产阶级共和就变成了假共和。蒋介石背叛了孙中山的革命事业，他虽然挂着资产阶级共和国的招牌，但实际上实行的是法西斯独裁。这是资产阶级民主主义、资产阶级共和国方案在中国的破产。
    十月革命的胜利，给中国送来了马列主义。中国民主革命出现了新的转机，由旧民主主义革命转变为新民主主义革命。中国共产党领导中国人民，经过28年艰苦卓绝的斗争，包括22年的武装斗争，千百万人流血牺牲，终于推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山的统治，建立了人民民主专政的人民共和国。一个世纪的曲折历史说明，中国不能选择资产阶级共和国的道路，唯一正确的是建立人民民主专政的共和国。所以，毛泽东同志说：“总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。这个专政必须和国际革命力量团结一致。这就是我们的公式，这就是我们的主要经验，这就是我们的主要纲领。”（《毛泽东选集》第1485页）
    在新的历史时期，邓小平同志针对否定四项基本原则的资产阶级自由化思潮指出：“没有无产阶级专政，我们就不可能保卫从而也不可能建设社会主义。”（《邓小平文选》第155页）我国人民民主专政建立以来40年的实践也证明：只有坚持人民民主专政，才有国家的强盛、社会的安定、国民经济的发展、人民权利的保障、群众生活的改善、我国国际地位的提高。历史和现实、经验和教训都告诉我们，四项基本原则是我们的立国之本，坚持人民民主专政，为我们坚持社会主义道路、坚持共产党的领导、坚持马列主义毛泽东思想提供了国家政权的可靠保证和重要依托。坚持人民民主专政是我们的基本经验。舍此，就没有人民的地位，就没有人民共和国的独立，就没有富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家。
    二、新型的专政，新型的民主
    我国是人民民主专政的社会主义国家。人民民主专政是对人民内部的民主与对敌对分子专政的结合，是新型民主与新型专政的结合。资产阶级国家虽然标榜“主权在民”，但实际上是资产阶级专政，即对多数人实行专政，少数人享受民主，对工人阶级和广大劳动人民实行专政，少数资产阶级剥削者享受民主。而无产阶级专政，在我国是人民民主专政，则破天荒第一次使工人阶级和其他劳动人民成了国家的主人，它与一切剥削阶级国家的性质相反，工人阶级和广大劳动人民享受民主，而对少数剥削者实行专政，进行统治。
    专政与民主是辩证统一的。一方面，专政与民主有着原则的区别，二者的对象、范围和方法都是不同的。如果把两者混淆起来，就会分辨不清甚至颠倒两类不同性质的矛盾，损害人民民主专政。另一方面，专政与民主又是紧密相联的。首先，专政与民主是同一个问题的两个方面。任何民主制的国家，都是一定阶级的民主与对一定阶级的专政的结合，都是民主与专政的统一体。掌握国家政权的统治阶级，既坚持对敌对阶级的专政，用来对付被统治阶级的反抗，同时又坚持在本阶级内部实行一定形式的民主，用以调节统治阶级内部的矛盾，组织自己的力量，以便对被统治阶级实行专政。资产阶级民主制，也就是资产阶级专政；无产阶级民主制，也就是无产阶级专政。其次，专政与民主互为前提，相互保证，相辅相成。正如邓小平同志所说的，“人民的民主同对敌人的专政分不开”。（《邓小平文选》第161页）只有努力扩大民主，充分调动人民群众的积极性，使他们行使当家作主的权利，才能使人民民主专政的国家政权有牢固的基础和强大的力量，才能对敌人进行有效的专政，对违宪违法分子进行有力制裁。同时，也只有坚持专政，毫不手软地打击敌人，才能保障人民的民主权利。没有专政，民主就失去了前提和保证。
    无产阶级专政是无产阶级和广大劳动人民不可须臾离开的护身法宝，因而历来遭到一切敌对势力的攻击和歪曲。资产阶级代表人物及其学者，总是一方面把资产阶级民主美化为全民民主，根本不承认是资产阶级专政；另一方面又把无产阶级专政说成“不民主”、“专制”。自从无产阶级专政诞生以来，从巴黎公社到苏维埃政权和我国人民民主专政，都曾被国内外敌人谩骂为“独裁”、“专制”、“暴政”。林彪鼓吹“政权就是镇压之权”，张春桥散布“全面专政”，都是只讲专政，否定民主，并把专政矛头指向党内和人民内部。前几年，有个非法组织叫“解冻社”，发表了一个宣言，公开反对人民民主专政，说我们坚持人民民主专政是“分裂人类”。上海有个所谓的“民主讨论会”，恶毒地说“万恶之源是无产阶级专政”。在这次动乱和反革命暴乱中，资产阶级自由化的头面人物、搞政治阴谋的人以及一些非法组织的头头，崇拜资产阶级民主，咒骂人民民主专政是“专制”，是“法西斯政权”，污蔑动用人民民主专政的柱石军队实行戒严是“法西斯恐吓手段”；而把他们造谣惑众、煽动闹事、霸占广场、设置路障、破坏秩序、侵犯人权，说成是“民主”。
    在人民内部也有将民主与专政割裂开来、对立起来的错误观念，这是属于思想认识问题。在有的人看来，似乎一讲民主，专政职能就消失了；一讲专政，就妨碍民主了。也有人总是把专政与专制等同起来。实际上，专政是国体问题，是讲哪个阶级占统治地位，专制是政体问题，是讲国家政权的组织形式。同属资产阶级专政的国家，有的采用民主制，有的采用专制制，而以前者为普遍。无产阶级专政只能采取民主制，否则它会变质。
    针对顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人对人民民主专政的否定和歪曲，邓小平同志反复强调必须坚持人民民主专政。他不但在坚持专政的问题上，讲得最多、最坚决、最彻底，而且在发展民主的问题上也讲得最多、最彻底、最深刻；他坚持两手抓，讲专政不忘讲民主，讲民主不忘讲专政。他认为，作为新型民主与新型专政相统一的社会主义民主，必须坚持民主与专政的统一、民主与集中的统一、民主与法制的统一、自由与纪律的统一、权利与义务的统一、人民民主与党的领导的统一。只有这样，才能把社会主义民主同资产阶级民主、个人主义民主严格地区别开来，才能防止极端民主化和无政府主义的严重泛滥。
    对于社会主义来说，更本质的东西是民主。这是因为，在社会主义条件下，劳动人民共同享有对生产资料的不同形式的所有权和支配权，在这个基础上，必然要求实现对国家事务、经济、文化和其他事务的管理权，即要求发展民主。社会主义优越于资本主义，社会主义由人民当家做主，不仅体现在经济方面，而且体现在思想文化和政治方面；不仅体现在能够更快地发展生产力，日益满足人民群众的物质和文化生活的需要，而且体现在有更高更切实的民主。没有民主就没有社会主义。正是民主，才是社会主义的真正本质，也就是说社会主义在本质上是民主的。列宁多次指出：“无产阶级专政的实质不仅在于暴力，而且主要不在于暴力。”（《列宁选集》第3卷第857页）。
  “无产阶级专政不只是对剥削者使用的暴力，甚至主要的不是暴力。”（《列宁选集》第4卷第9页）这里主要是指，无产阶级专政作为无产阶级和劳动人民自己的政权，虽然要对剥削阶级的反抗进行镇压，但更重要的是组织人民进行建设，发展生产，管理国家。列宁这里讲的还是过渡时期的无产阶级专政，剥削阶级还没有被消灭。到了社会主义时期，剥削阶级已经消灭，无产阶级专政的实质更应该“主要不在于暴力”。从社会主义发展的总趋势看，民主的范围越来越大，专政的范围逐步缩小。社会主义愈发展，民主也愈发展。这是确定无疑的。
    三、专政要继续，民主要扩大
    在我国，尽管剥削阶级已经消灭，阶级斗争已经不再是主要矛盾，但专政仍要继续坚持。由于国内的因素和国际的影响，阶级斗争还将在一定范围内长期存在，有时还会激化，这是不以人的意志为转移的。敌视和破坏社会主义制度的敌对势力和敌对分子以及其他各种犯罪分子、蜕化变质分子、新剥削分子仍然存在，必须打击和制止他们的破坏活动；帝国主义和其他反社会主义势力仍然存在，必须防御其可能的侵略和颠覆活动。这次在首都发生的这场反革命暴乱以血的事实也证明了这一点。所以，那种认为“坚持人民民主专政无对象”的观点是没有根据的，在实践中也是有害的。阶级斗争远没有熄灭，专政的观念决不能淡化。我们必须作好长期斗争的精神准备，坚持人民民主专政国家的专政职能。
    在专政必须继续坚持的同时，还应努力扩大民主。1956年，周恩来同志根据我国社会主义改造基本完成、剥削阶级已经消灭的特点，深刻地指出：“现在我们的人民民主专政应该是：专政要继续，民主要扩大。”（《周恩来选集》下卷第207页）他认为，民主所以要扩大，不仅为人民民主专政的强大和敌人活动余地的缩小所许可，还为苏联和我国整个无产阶级专政的历史经验所证实，因此，“扩大民主，这一点更带有本质的意义”。
  （同上）毛泽东同志根据我国生产资料私有制的社会主义改造基本完成后社会矛盾和阶级矛盾的变化，提出根本的任务是发展生产力，即重点是抓经济建设，而正确处理人民内部矛盾就成了国家政治生活的总题目，并且规定了正确处理人民内部矛盾的一系列民主原则，制定了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一发展科学、文化的正确方针。他针对当时一些地方罢工罢课的情况指出，为了防止这类事件的发生，根本的方法是加强教育和扩大民主。他还指出：“我们的目标，是想造成一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面，以利于社会主义革命和社会主义建设，较易于克服困难，较快地建设我国的现代工业和现代农业，党和国家较为巩固，较为能够经受风险。”（《一九五七年夏季的形势》）可惜，由于种种复杂的原因，一度出现了阶级斗争扩大化的错误倾向，“文化大革命”时期，人民民主专政的国家制度遭到了严重的破坏。
    十一届三中全会以来，我们党正确总结了在坚持人民民主专政问题上的经验教训，确认了“专政要继续，民主要扩大”的原则。邓小平同志在专门论述坚持无产阶级专政问题的同时，又专门论述扩大民主的重要性，指出：“在民主的实践方面，我们过去作得不够，并且犯过错误。林彪、‘四人帮’宣传什么‘全面专政’，对人民实行封建法西斯专政，我们已彻底粉碎了这个专政。这与无产阶级专政毫无共同之点，而且完全相反。现在我们已经坚决纠正了过去的错误，并且采取各种措施继续努力扩大党内民主和人民民主。”（《邓小平文选》第154页）在邓小平同志的多次讲话中，在党中央的一些重要文件里，都曾经反复总结了建国以来忽视民主建设的失误，明确指出：建国以来，没有重视民主政治建设，“成了‘文化大革命’得以发生的一个重要条件，这是一个沉痛教训。”（《中国共产党中央委员会关于建国以来党的若干历史问题的决议》）“我国社会主义发展中的主要历史教训，一是没有集中力量发展经济，二是没有切实建设民主政治。”（《中共中央关于社会主义精神文明建设指导方针的决议》）
    当前，摆在全党全国人民面前的头等大事是，完成党的十三届四中全会提出的四项任务。我们必须加强人民民主专政，彻底平息反革命暴乱，为继续进行社会主义现代化建设创造一个安定的政治局面和社会环境；努力扩大民主，加强监督，惩治腐败，取信于民。
    坚持社会主义国家的专政职能，彻底平息反革命暴乱，是当前第一位的政治任务。我们已经取得了制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利，但尚未取得彻底胜利。我们面对的是一伙妄图推翻共产党的领导、颠覆人民民主专政的社会主义国家政权的敌人。对这些凶残的敌人决不能心慈手软。这次动乱和反革命暴乱告诉我们，社会主义国家的专政职能必须坚持和强化，决不能削弱，更不能取消。在我国，履行专政职能的，包括军事机关、审判机关、检察机关、安全机关、公安机关等，即军队、警察、法庭、监狱等强制机构。特别要指出，人民军队作为人民民主专政的柱石和国家机器的重要组成部分，具有抵御外来侵略和镇压国内外敌对势力和敌对分子颠覆破坏活动的双重职能。我们要努力加强这些强制机构的建设，使它们逐步达到设备齐全、装备精良、体制合理、人员精干、效能高强，更好地发挥其维护国家利益和安全的作用。
    要努力扩大民主，就要继续按照十三大确定的关于政治体制改革和加强民主政治建设的方针、原则和要求，做到既坚定不移，积极努力，又稳定推进，逐步进行。现阶段的民主政治建设，必须着眼于实效，着眼于调动基层群众的积极性，要从办得到的事情做起，致力于人民代表大会制等基本制度的完善。当前的民主政治建设，必须强调坚决惩治腐败，加强廉政建设。应当看到，党政机关存在的腐败现象，是人民民主专政的社会主义国家政权的腐蚀剂，它不仅破坏了党的战斗力和政府的权威性，损害了党和政府在人民群众心目中的形象，而且严重地挫伤了人民群众社会主义现代化建设的积极性。怎样惩治腐败、防止腐败、根治腐败？最重要的是加强民主建设，扩大人民民主，确保人民的监督权。失去监督的权力，会导致腐败。这对于高级干部来说，就更为重要。必须记取这个历史的教训。早在1945年，正当抗日战争即将取得胜利的时候，著名民主人士黄炎培
  向毛泽东同志提出，一人、一家、一团体、一地方乃至一国，大凡初期都能精神振奋，克服艰难困苦，而往后时间长了，环境渐好，精神渐退，惰性发作，到风气养成，无法扭转，无法补救，一部历史总跳不出由兴盛到衰败的周期率。他问道：中共能否找出一条新路，跳出这周期率的支配？他提的问题发人深省。毛泽东当时答道：“我们已经找到新路，我们能跳出这个周期率。这条新路，就是民主。只有让人民来监督政府，政府才不敢松懈。只有人人起来负责，才不会人亡政息。”这些话，今天读起来仍然非常亲切。
    最近，中共中央政治局全体会议根据十三届四中全会和邓小平同志最近讲话精神，讨论并通过了《中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》。这使人民看到，党和政府不仅有惩治腐败的决心，而且有惩治腐败的措施。这几件事做好了，真正干出实绩来，必会振奋人心，取信于民。只要我们扎扎实实搞好民主政治建设，健全监督制度，保证人民的监督权，坚持公民在法律和制度面前人人平等，党员在党章和党纪面前人人平等，真正做到有法可依，有法必依，执法必严，违法必究，确实使民主制度化、法律化，就能彻底解决搞特权、违法乱纪和腐败的问题，使人民民主专政更加巩固。
