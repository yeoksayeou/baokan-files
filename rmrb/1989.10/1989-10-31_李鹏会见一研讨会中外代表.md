Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 30th.

Premier Li Peng today said that the new leadership collective of the Communist Party of China, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, established at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, is united, powerful, and stable.

He made these remarks this afternoon when meeting with representatives attending the Symposium on Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and the Asia-Pacific Region.

He told more than 250 foreign government officials, entrepreneurs, scholars, and experts from 20 countries and regions, as well as over 100 Chinese representatives, that China's political situation is now stable, and there have been some positive changes in the economy, but difficulties still exist. With the implementation of the rectification and adjustment policies, these difficulties will gradually be overcome, thereby ensuring that China's economy maintains sustained, stable, and coordinated development.

Li Peng also mentioned that with the gradual stabilization of social order, the martial law imposed on certain areas of Beijing will undergo some changes in form, and the armed police will replace the troops on duty at Tiananmen Square.

After briefly introducing the nature and goals of China's reforms to the representatives, Li Peng reiterated that the Chinese government is willing to continue developing relations with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is willing to expand exchanges and cooperation with Asia-Pacific countries in the fields of economy, technology, trade, and more.

He wished the symposium success, hoping it would contribute to promoting economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

　　李鹏会见一研讨会中外代表
    新华社北京10月30日电　国务院总理李鹏今天说，在党的十三届四中全会上确立的以江泽民同志为核心的党的新领导集体是团结的、有力量的、稳定的。
    他是在下午会见出席中国与亚太地区经济贸易合作研讨会的代表时说这番话的。
    他对来自20个国家和地区的250多位外国政府官员、企业家、知名学者和专家以及100多位中国代表说，中国现在政局稳定，经济上也出现了一些积极的变化，但困难还是存在的。随着治理整顿方针的贯彻，这些困难将逐步得到克服，从而使中国经济保持持续稳定协调的发展。
    李鹏还特别提到，随着社会秩序日趋稳定，北京部分地区实行的戒严在方式上要发生一些变化，天安门广场执勤的戒严部队将由武装警察代替。
    在简要地向代表们介绍了中国改革的性质和目标之后，李鹏重申中国政府愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上继续发展与其它国家的关系，愿意同亚太地区国家在经济、技术、贸易等方面扩大交流和合作。
