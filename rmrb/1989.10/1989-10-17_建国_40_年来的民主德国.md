The German Democratic Republic has completed 40 years since its founding. On October 7, 1949, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic marked a turning point in the history of the German people and Europe. As the greatest achievement of the revolutionary German workers' movement, it is the result of a long and arduous struggle by all progressive forces to establish a state free from capitalist exploitation, nationalism, and aggressive ambitions.

The birth of the Democratic Republic is part of the world revolutionary process, a link in the chain of victories by the peoples of various countries. It proclaims the transition from capitalism to socialism. The Democratic Republic is firmly rooted in the socialist world, a victory in the process of anti-fascist democratic and socialist transformation in East Germany after the liberation of the German people. The masses exercised their right to self-determination, choosing socialism and a society with true freedom, democracy, and human rights. The history of the past 40 years has proven that socialism has taken root on German soil in an irreversible way.

The Democratic Republic has consistently fulfilled its historical responsibility, striving to ensure that war will never again break out from German soil. As an equal member of the international family of nations, it cooperates extensively with the socialist world and pursues peace and social progress as the guiding principles of its policy. Located in the heart of Europe, on the sensitive dividing line between two social systems and two major military alliances, the Democratic Republic, as a stable socialist pillar, has a beneficial influence on the situation in Europe and the world, especially at a time when the international situation is changing rapidly. The policy of dialogue and cooperation of the Democratic Republic is universally praised.

We are particularly pleased that the visit of Erich Honecker, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, to China in October 1986 has led to the normalization of relations between the two countries, and the relationship between the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of China has reached a new level.

Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the working people have achieved tremendous successes in the past 40 years. These achievements have been made through hard work and struggle, under conditions of openness to the world and in the face of constant attempts by imperialism to interfere in internal affairs and reverse the historical course on German soil. History and geography have given the Democratic Republic a special mission: to provide proof that a new social system is ultimately superior in all respects. Under these conditions, it has become a matter of life and death to stand firmly in the socialist world, to carry out effective political and ideological work, and to engage in the complex competition between socialism and capitalism.

The Democratic Republic is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a state with a sound and efficient socialist system. Socialist planned economy, based on the public ownership of the main means of production and its dominant position in the national economy (while collective and private ownership also exist), has ensured the high-speed development of the national economy.

The growth of national income reflects this. From 1949 to 1989, national income increased by more than 11 times, from 24.9 billion marks at the time of the founding of the state to 279 billion marks this year, with an average annual growth rate of 4%. This growth rate was achieved to a large extent, and since 1986 entirely, by increasing labor productivity. Compared to 1949, labor productivity in 1989 increased by 9.5 times.

The main part of the increase in economic efficiency is due to industry, which currently accounts for 65% of national income. Industrial output per day increased from 1.28 billion marks in 1949 to 23.1 billion marks in 1989. In its main economic sectors, the Democratic Republic has kept pace with the rapid technological progress and created its own high-tech products. The Democratic Republic is one of the few developed industrial countries in the world that can systematically master the research, production, and use of microelectronics. The production and application of microelectronics are increasingly penetrating all major sectors of the national economy and are expanding into the fields of science, education, and health.

Due to the collective ownership and its close cooperation with the full ownership of the people, the agriculture of the Democratic Republic has achieved high efficiency, thus ensuring the growing demand of the people for basic foodstuffs. In terms of meat and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter, eggs, and other major foodstuffs, the per capita consumption of the Democratic Republic is among the highest in the world.

The highly effective education system is one of the most important achievements of the Democratic Republic. All children can receive a ten-year general technical education. Today, 90% of workers have received systematic vocational training, compared to only 25% in 1949. Today, 1.7 million employees have received higher and specialized education, accounting for 22% of the total number of employees.

The growing economic strength of the Democratic Republic provides a solid foundation for improving the material and cultural living standards of the people, social stability, full employment, equal educational opportunities for all, and free medical care. This is in line with the guidelines adopted by the Eighth Party Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1971, which is everything for the happiness of the people and the interests of the working class and all working people. The basic point of this guideline is to give full play to the role of the producers, and to link the growing economic benefits and social achievements clearly, which can encourage people to devote themselves more to socialism.

In the early 1970s, we proposed that the housing problem, as the core of the welfare policy, would be solved as a social problem by 1991. In the Second World War, about 1/4 of the housing in the territory of the Democratic Republic was destroyed or damaged, and in some large cities even more than 50%. In 1949, there were only 5.1 million housing units, i.e., 270 housing units per 1,000 people, and the per capita housing area was only 12 square meters. In 1989, there were more than 7 million housing units, i.e., 422 housing units per 1,000 people, and the per capita housing area was 27 square meters. Now, 581 housing units are newly built or renovated every day, compared to only 82 in 1949. Between 1971 and 1989, 9.8 million residents have significantly improved their housing conditions. The state's expenditure on housing and related facilities, such as schools, kindergartens, nurseries, shops, sports halls, etc., accounts for 10% of the gross national product in the same period. The battle cry of the German workers' movement, "A warm, safe, and dry home for everyone," will soon become a reality.

The housing construction program embodies the principle of integrating economic policy with social welfare policy. This principle is also reflected in the per capita actual income. In 1988, the per capita actual income was 8.4 times that of 1949. At the same time, it should be noted that for more than 30 years, the people of the Democratic Republic have been buying meat, butter, milk, bread, and other basic foodstuffs at the same price, as well as heating, electricity, transportation, and many industrial products. In 1989, the state subsidized 84 marks for every 100 marks of basic foodstuffs. In addition, a series of measures to help young families, working mothers with children, youth, and retired workers also belong to the welfare achievements of the Democratic Republic.

Numerous facts show that 40 years, although short in history, have made the Democratic Republic a country that can clearly prove the vitality of socialism. Our people are proud of the achievements they have made and are facing the challenges of the future, entering the fifth decade. The Twelfth Party Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, to be held in May 1990, will look to the future, formulate tasks for the future, and the central theme will be to further strengthen socialism, enhance its attractiveness, and maintain world peace.

    建国40年来的民主德国
    德国统一社会党中央机关报《新德意志报》评论员　弗兰茨·柯尼平
    德意志民主共和国自建国至今已走完了40年的历程。1949年10月7日德意志民主共和国的成立，标志着德意志人民和欧洲历史上的一个转折点。她作为革命的德国工人运动的最伟大成就，是所有进步力量为争取建立一个没有资本主义剥削、没有民族主义和侵略野心的国家而进行的长期艰苦斗争的结果。
    民主德国的诞生是世界革命进程的一部分，是各国人民取得胜利的一环。它宣告了资本主义向社会主义的过渡。民主德国牢牢地立足于社会主义世界，是德意志人民获得解放后德国东部所进行的反法西斯的民主和社会主义变革这一整个过程中的胜利成果。人民群众行使他们的自决权，选择了社会主义，选择了一个拥有真正自由、民主和人权的社会。过去40年的历史证明，社会主义在德意志土地上不可逆转地站稳了脚跟。
    民主德国始终不渝地履行自己的历史责任，努力使战争永远不再从德意志土地上爆发。她作为国际民族大家庭中平等的一员，与社会主义世界广泛合作，并以和平与社会进步作为自己政策的宗旨。民主德国地处欧洲心脏，在两种社会制度和两个最大军事联盟的敏感的分界线上。作为稳定的社会主义支柱，对欧洲和世界局势产生着良好的影响，尤其是在当前国际局势多变的时刻，民主德国的对话与合作政策受到普遍赞扬。
    我们感到特别高兴的是，德国统一社会党中央委员会总书记、德意志民主共和国国务委员会主席埃里希·昂纳克1986年10月正式友好访华以来，两国关系全面正常化，德国统一社会党和中国共产党的关系提高到了一个崭新的水平。
    在德国统一社会党的领导下，劳动人民在过去40年中所取得的巨大成就有目共睹。这些成就是通过努力工作和艰苦斗争取得的，是在对世界开放的条件下以及帝国主义不断企图干涉内政和倒转德意志土地上的历史车轮的形势下取得的。历史和地理位置赋予民主德国一项特殊的使命，即提供新的社会制度在各个方面最终是优越的证明。在这种条件下，牢牢地立足于社会主义世界，积极有效地进行政治思想工作，不断地投身于社会主义和资本主义之间的复杂竞赛，就成了生死攸关的问题。
    民主德国是作为一个拥有健全而高效的社会主义制度的国家，来庆祝自己成立40周年的。社会主义计划经济在主要生产资料公有制及其在国民经济中占有主导地位的基础上（同时存在有集体和私人所有制），保证了国民经济的高速发展。
    国民收入的增长反映了这一点。从1949年至1989年，国民收入增长了11倍以上，从建国时的249亿马克提高到今年的2790亿马克，年均增长4％。这一增长速度在很大程度上，而自1986年以来则是全部地靠提高劳动生产率取得的。同1949年相比，1989年的劳动生产率提高了9.5倍。
    经济效率增长的主要部分是依靠工业，目前工业产值占国民收入的65％。工业日产值从1949年的1.28亿马克提高到1989年的23.1亿马克。在其主要经济部门，民主德国已经赶上了飞速发展的科技进步步伐，且创造了自己的尖端产品。民主德国属于世界上为数不多的可以系统掌握微电子研究、生产和使用的发达工业国家。微电子的生产和应用日益渗透到国民经济的各主要领域，并扩大到科学、教育和卫生领域。
    由于集体所有制及其与全民所有制的密切配合，民主德国的农业取得了高效的发展，从而稳定地保证了人民群众对基本食品日益增长的需求。在肉食和牛奶、奶酪、黄油、鸡蛋等其它主要食品方面，民主德国的人均消费量居世界前列。
    卓有成效的教育体制，是民主德国所取得的最重要成果之一。所有儿童都可以接受十年制普通综合技术学校教育。今天，90％的职工接受过系统的职业培训，而在1949年只有25％。今天，170万就业者接受过高等和专业教育，占就业总数的22％。
    民主德国日益增强的经济实力，为提高人民物质文化生活水平、社会安定、全员就业、人人享有同等教育的机会以及免费医疗，提供了坚实的基础。这符合1971年德国统一社会党第八次代表大会制订的方针，即一切为了人民的幸福以及工人阶级和所有劳动人民的利益。这一方针的基本点在于发挥生产者的作用，日益增长的经济效益和社会成果之间明确挂钩，可以鼓励人们更加投身于社会主义。
    我们在70年代初曾经提出，作为福利政策核心的住房问题，到1991年将作为社会问题加以解决。在第二次世界大战中，民主德国领土上被毁或受损的住房约占1／4，在一些大城市甚至达50％以上。1949年仅有510万套住房，即每千人平均拥有住房270套，人均住房面积仅为12平方米。1989年共有住房700多万套，即每千人平均拥有422套，人均住房面积为27平方米。现在每天新建或改建住房581套，而1949年仅为82套。1971年至1989年间就有980万居民彻底改善了住房条件。国家用于住房及其配套设施建设的费用，例如学校、托儿所、幼儿园、商店、体育馆等，占同期生产性国民收入的10％。德国工人运动的战斗口号“为每人提供一套温暖、安全、干燥的住房”，不久将成为现实。
    住房建设纲领体现了经济政策与社会福利政策相统一的方针。这一方针也在人均实际收入方面得到了反映。1988年的人均实际收入为1949年的8.4倍。同时还应该考虑到，民主德国人民30多年来始终在用同等的价格购买肉类、黄油、牛奶、面包和其他基本食品，取暖、用电、交通以及许多工业品的价格也是如此。1989年，国家为每100马克的基本食品就补贴84马克。除此之外，帮助年轻家庭、抚养孩子的在职女工、青年和退休工人的一系列措施，也属于民主德国的福利成果之一。
    大量事实表明，40年虽然在历史上是短暂的，但民主德国在40年里却成为一个可以清楚地证明社会主义生命力的国家。我国人民正满怀对已经取得的成就的自豪，面对未来的挑战，跨入第五个10年。1990年5月召开的德国统一社会党第十二次代表大会将着眼未来，制订今后的任务，其中心议题将是进一步加强社会主义，增强其吸引力以及维护世界和平。
