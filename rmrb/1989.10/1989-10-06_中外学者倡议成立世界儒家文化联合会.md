Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th.

Chinese and foreign scholars propose the establishment of the World Confucian Cultural Federation. At the academic discussion meeting held today to commemorate the 2540th anniversary of Confucius' birth, more than 120 Chinese and foreign scholars proposed the establishment of the World Confucian Cultural Federation to strengthen academic exchanges between Confucian scholars and Confucian studies institutions in various countries.

This proposal was first put forward by Professor Hans Müller of the Federal Republic of Germany, and was supported by the attendees. They believe that the Confucian doctrine established by Confucius has not only played a significant role in the development of Chinese society but has also had a profound impact on world culture. Strengthening the study and dissemination of Confucianism has become a global issue.

This academic discussion meeting was organized by the newly established domestic non-governmental research institution, the Chinese Confucius Association.

    中外学者倡议
    成立世界儒家文化联合会
    新华社北京10月5日电　（记者李光茹）在今天结束的纪念孔子诞辰2540周年学术讨论会上，120多位中外学者倡议成立世界儒家文化联合会，以加强各国儒学家和儒学研究机构之间的学术交流。
    这一倡议由联邦德国汉学家万小力首先提出，得到与会者的附议。他们认为，孔子所创立的儒家学说，不仅对中国社会发展起过重大作用，而且对世界文化产生着重大影响，加强儒学的研究和传播现已成为世界性课题。
    这次学术讨论会由刚刚成立的国内民间研究机构——中华孔子学会主办。
