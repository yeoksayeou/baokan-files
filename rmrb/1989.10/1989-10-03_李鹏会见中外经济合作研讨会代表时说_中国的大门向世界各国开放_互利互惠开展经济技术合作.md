	Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, said today that regardless of any disturbances, China is willing to maintain friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China is willing to further develop mutually beneficial economic and technological cooperation and trade exchanges with them. This fundamental policy will not change.

	Li Peng said this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People while meeting with representatives attending the Sino-Foreign Economic Cooperation Seminar that China's door is open to all countries around the world, and the Chinese people themselves will not close it.

	He said that China is a developing country, and currently, the most important task for China is to develop its productive forces and gradually achieve prosperity and strength.

	Li Peng said that due to historical reasons and national conditions, the Chinese people have chosen the socialist system. Of course, this does not mean that the current system in China is already perfect. China is carrying out reforms precisely to develop and improve the socialist system.

	He said that engaging in economic and technological cooperation with the outside world is not just beneficial to China; cooperation is mutually beneficial. "Differences in ideology should not hinder us from becoming friends and developing cooperation. There is a Chinese saying: 'Seek common ground while reserving differences.' I hope that friendly cooperation based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect will continue to develop."

	Li Peng emphasized that China's political situation is stable, the leadership core is united, and China's future is bright.

	Li Peng also pointed out that "Jiang Zemin has rich experience in political and economic work, and we support him as our leadership core."

	Some foreign representatives attending the seminar said that this seminar conducted very constructive discussions. They are optimistic about the prospects of economic and trade cooperation with China. Some said that when they leave China, some of their original concerns will disappear. They fully agree with Premier Li Peng's statement that cooperation is mutually beneficial. Some representatives also said that many businesspeople and economists in the West want to cooperate with China.

	The Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, Rong Yiren, and State Councilor Zhou Jiaxuan participated in the meeting.

	This evening, Rong Yiren held a reception at the Prince Gong Mansion to welcome the representatives attending the Sino-Foreign Economic Seminar. Premier Li Peng and his wife, Zhu Lin, and State Councilor Zhou Jiaxuan attended the reception. Li Peng had extensive contact and discussions with economic figures from various countries.

    李鹏会见中外经济合作研讨会代表时说
    中国的大门向世界各国开放  互利互惠开展经济技术合作
    本报北京10月2日电　新华社记者朱云龙、本报记者计泓赓报道：国务院总理李鹏今天说，不管出现什么风波，中国愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上同世界各国友好相处，愿同它们进一步开展互利的经济技术合作和贸易往来，这一基本政策是不会改变的。
    李鹏今天下午在人民大会堂会见参加中外经济合作研讨会的代表时说，中国的大门是向世界各国开放的，中国人自己不会把大门关上。
    他说，中国是一个发展中国家，当前，在中国第一位的事情是发展生产力，使国家逐步繁荣富强起来。
    李鹏说，由于历史原因和本国国情，中国人民选择了社会主义制度。当然，这并不是说中国现行的体制已经很完善，中国实行改革，正是为了发展和完善社会主义制度。
    他说，对外开展经济技术合作，不光是中国一方受益，合作是互惠互利的。“意识形态的不同不应妨碍我们结成朋友、发展合作。中国有句话：‘求同存异’。我希望建立在平等互利和互相尊重基础上的友好合作不断发展。”
    李鹏强调，中国的政局是稳定的，领导核心是团结的，中国的前途是光明的。
    李鹏还指出，“江泽民有丰富的政治和经济工作的经验，我们支持他作为我们的领导核心。”
    参加研讨会的一些外国代表表示，这次研讨会进行了很有建设性的讨论。他们对同中国开展经济和贸易合作的前景持乐观态度。有的说，待离开中国的时候，一些原来的担心是会消失的。他们表示完全同意李鹏总理所说的，开展合作是互利互惠的。有的代表还说，西方的许多企业家和经济界人士都想同中国开展合作。
    全国人大常委会副委员长、中信公司董事长荣毅仁、国务委员邹家华等参加了会见。
    今天晚上，荣毅仁在恭王府举行招待会，招待参加中外经济研讨会的代表。李鹏总理和夫人朱琳、国务委员邹家华出席了招待会。李鹏同各国经济界人士进行了广泛接触和交谈。
