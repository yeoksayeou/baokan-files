North Korean Minister of Culture and Arts Highly Praises China's "Crackdown on Pornography"
"Crackdown on Pornography" Will Promote Development of Chinese Arts

Pyongyang, October 17 (Xinhua) — North Korean Minister of Culture and Arts Jang Chol today told Xinhua News Agency reporters that China's "crackdown on pornography" aligns with the essential requirements of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This campaign will promote the development of China's socialist arts and inspire the Chinese people to engage in socialist causes.

Jang Chol is one of the veteran leaders of North Korea's arts sector. He served as the Deputy Minister of Culture and Arts for 21 years and has been the Minister of Culture and Arts since 1986. Today, during a meeting with reporters at the Pyongyang International Cultural Center, he said that China's "crackdown on pornography" after suppressing the turmoil and riots is of great significance. Pornographic publications do not belong to the category of socialist culture; they violate the cultural policies of the Communist Party of China. China's "crackdown on pornography" will eliminate cultural trends that are contrary to socialist arts, allowing healthy culture and arts to flourish.

Jang Chol introduced the great achievements in developing national culture in North Korea. He said that under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, North Korea has made comprehensive progress in film, drama, literature, music, fine arts, and acrobatics. North Korean arts have become an important means of educating the masses.

He said that in inheriting national cultural heritage, North Korea adheres to the principles of party leadership, proletarian leadership, and historical materialism. The principles of party leadership and proletarian leadership mean evaluating and handling cultural heritage based on the interests of the proletariat and the party's policies. The principle of historical materialism means viewing cultural heritage based on specific historical conditions. Without these two principles, nationalism or conservatism will emerge. When discussing North Korea's attitude towards advanced foreign cultures, he said that absorbing the excellent cultures of other countries is a consistent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea. However, introducing advanced foreign cultures is not the goal; rather, it is to digest and absorb these cultures to contribute to the development of socialist national arts.

He said that currently, imperialists are launching a reactionary ideological and cultural offensive to undermine socialism. The infiltration of bourgeois ideology and culture is mainly carried out through arts. North Korea pays special attention to preventing the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and culture. In artistic creation, North Korea strictly guards against the emergence of bourgeois liberalization.

    朝鲜文化艺术部长高度评价中国“扫黄”
    “扫黄”将促进中国文艺发展
    新华社平壤十月十七日电（记者张锦芳）朝鲜文化艺术部长张澈今天在对新华社记者发表谈话时说，中国开展“扫黄”工作符合建设具有中国特色的社会主义的本质要求。这项工作将促进中国的社会主义文艺事业的发展，鼓舞中国人民投入中国的社会主义事业。
    张澈是朝鲜文艺部门老资格的领导人之一，曾担任朝鲜文化艺术部副部长二十一年，一九八六年起担任文化艺术部长。他今天在平壤国际文化会馆会见记者时说，中国在制止动乱和平息暴乱后开展“扫黄”工作具有十分重要的意义。黄色出版物根本不属于社会主义文化的范畴，它违背中国共产党的文艺政策。中国开展的“扫黄”工作将铲除与社会主义文艺相反的文化潮流，使健康的文化艺术得到发展。
    张澈介绍了朝鲜发展民族文化取得的巨大成果。他说，在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，朝鲜在电影、戏剧、小说、音乐、美术和杂技等方面得到了全面发展。朝鲜文艺已发展成为教育群众的重要手段。
    他说，朝鲜在继承民族文化遗产时坚持党性、工人阶级性原则和历史主义原则。党性和工人阶级性原则就是以工人阶级的利益和党的政策为基准评价和处理文化遗产。历史主义原则就是根据具体历史条件看待文化遗产。离开这两条原则，就会出现民族虚无主义或复古主义。他在谈到朝鲜对待外来先进文化的态度时说，吸收别国优秀的文化是朝鲜劳动党一贯坚持的文艺政策。但是，引进外国先进文化本身不是目的，而是要对外来先进文化加以消化吸收，使之为发展社会主义民族文艺作出贡献。
    他说，当前，帝国主义者为了瓦解社会主义，正在发动反动的思想文化攻势。资产阶级思想文化的侵袭主要通过文艺形式进行。朝鲜特别注意防止资产阶级思想文化的侵袭。在文艺创作方面，朝鲜严格提防资产阶级自由化的出现。
