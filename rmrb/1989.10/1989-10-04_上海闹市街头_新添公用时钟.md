A large clock, standing atop an 18-story building at the center of Jiading County in Shanghai, began chiming melodious musical chimes on September 28. This clock, known as the "Mosida" clock, has four faces, each with an area of 16 square meters, making it the second-largest public clock in Shanghai after the Customs House clock.

This clock is just one part of Shanghai's plan to install public clocks in bustling street areas. Recently, nearly 30 prominent public clocks have been erected in locations such as the central garden on Hengshan Road, across from Shanyang Park on Huaihai Road, the green belt at Laoximen, and the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shimen Road. Most of these clocks are powered by solar energy.

    上海闹市街头　新添公用时钟
    据新华社上海10月3日电　（记者李正华、通讯员张达昶）位于上海嘉定县城中心一座18层高楼的顶端、面积仅次于海关大钟、4个立面每面面积达16平方米的“摩士达”大钟，9月28日正式响起了悦耳的音乐报时钟声。
    这座大钟仅是上海市在闹市街头安装公用大钟的规划中的一个。不久前，在上海市区的衡山路街心花园、淮海路襄阳公园对面、老西门绿化地带、南京路石门路口等近30处，已经竖起了醒目的公用时钟。这些时钟大部分采用太阳能为动力。
