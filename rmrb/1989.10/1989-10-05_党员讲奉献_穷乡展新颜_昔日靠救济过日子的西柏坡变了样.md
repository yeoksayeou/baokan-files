Party members in West Berghof, a famous old revolutionary base in Ping Shan County, Hebei Province, have inherited the revolutionary tradition of serving the people wholeheartedly and have won the praise of the local residents.

The reporter visited West Berghof on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and saw a village where the mountains are covered with fruit trees, the rivers are full of fish, farmers raise livestock, the fields are lush with crops, and rural industries are thriving. All 16 natural villages have roads suitable for cars, and 80% of the households have access to running water.

From May 1948 to March 1949, West Berghof was the headquarters of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army. It was the last rural command post in Chinese revolutionary history.

In 1958, a large reservoir was built in West Berghof, submerging the original fertile fields, and the villagers moved to the hills. The farmers of West Berghof, who had relied on farming for generations, lived by a large reservoir but neither ate fish nor knew that fish could be sold for money. Until 1986, the more than 7,000 people in West Berghof had less than half an acre of land per person, with an annual income of less than 90 yuan, and relied on relief for grain every year. The more than 380 Communist Party members in West Berghof were anxious about this situation.

In 1986, a new secretary, Qi Wenhui, aged 39, was appointed by the West Berghof Township Party Committee. Qi Wenhui visited every household, listening to the voices and suggestions of the villagers. Old Party member Yan Lianzhang held Qi Wenhui's hand and said with tears, "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao lived here. We cannot rely on state relief to live anymore and bring shame to the Party."

A Party meeting was held, and the Young Pioneers also participated. Everyone talked about the mountains of West Berghof and the large reservoir. They took an oath to do good deeds for the villagers. They planned to plant economic forests on the mountains in layers. Secretary Qi Wenhui led all the Party and Youth League members up the mountain. The Party branch secretary of Xigou Village, Feng Lanquan, gave up his profitable personal business and persuaded the villagers to go up the mountain. The villagers said, "The secretary is doing this for us. Why should we stay here?" The village accountant, Li Lianming, a female Communist Party member, left her three children at home with her husband, who was a cadre in Shijiazhuang, and also went up the mountain. An 80-year-old Party member, Wei Ying, also went up the mountain. He said, "If I can live to see the changes in my hometown, I will die content as a Party member." The famous stonemason Liu Jingqiang, who could earn more than 2,000 yuan a year outside, was persuaded by Secretary Feng Lanquan. He said, "I am a villager here. Seeing you Party members doing this for everyone, how can I not go up the mountain?" He not only went up the mountain but also wrote an application to join the Party last year and became the deputy village head.

After more than three years of construction, West Berghof has adjusted its industrial structure, and the per capita income has increased to more than 300 yuan. The Communist Party members here have also gained prestige among the people. This year, the Ping Shan County Party Committee called on all Party members in the county to learn from the West Berghof Party members' spirit of selfless devotion, scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, and spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, and to serve the villagers wholeheartedly.

### 党员讲奉献　穷乡展新颜  昔日靠救济过日子的西柏坡变了样

    党员讲奉献　穷乡展新颜
    昔日靠救济过日子的西柏坡变了样
    新华社石家庄10月4日电　（记者罗绮）著名老解放区河北省平山县西柏坡的共产党员们，继承革命传统，全心全意为乡亲服务，获得群众好评。
    记者是在国庆40周年前夕来西柏坡采访的，看到的景象是山有林果水有鱼，农户有养殖，地里庄稼好，乡村工业办得热火朝天；16个自然村，村村通了汽车；80％的农家用上了自来水。
    西柏坡1948年5月至1949年3月是中共中央和中国人民解放军总部的驻地，是中国革命史上最后一个农村指挥所。
    1958年西柏坡修了座大水库，淹掉了原来的良田，老百姓住到了山梁上。祖祖辈辈靠种地吃饭的西柏坡农民，守着个大水库，既不吃鱼，也不知道鱼可以卖钱。一直到1986年，西柏坡7000多口人，人均不到半亩地，收入不到90元，吃粮年年靠救济。西柏坡的380多名共产党员，对此心急如焚。
    1986年，中共西柏坡乡委员会调来一位新书记，39岁，名叫齐文辉。齐文辉走村串户，倾听乡亲们的呼声和建议。老党员阎连章拉着齐文辉的手，哭着说，党中央、毛主席在咱们这里住过，咱们可再不能给党丢人，靠国家救济过日子了。
    党员大会召开了，团员们也来参加。大家说西柏坡的山，说西柏坡那个大水库，集体宣誓要为乡亲们做好事。他们要在山上分层次种植经济林果。乡党委书记齐文辉带领全乡党团员们上山了。西沟村党支部书记封兰圈舍弃了能赚钱的个人营生，挨家逐户说服群众上山。群众说：“支书为了我们，我们还呆着干啥。”村里的会计李联明是位女共产党员，丈夫在石家庄当干部，她把三个孩子放在家里，也上山了。80岁的老党员魏英也上山了，他说：“能活着看到家乡的变化，我这个党员死了也甘心了。”远近闻名的石匠刘景强，一年在外可赚2000多元。支书封兰圈找他，他说：“我是这村的人，看到你们党员这么干，还不是为了大家？我有什么理由不上山？”他不仅上了山，去年还写了入党申请书，并当了副村长。
    西柏坡经过3年多的建设，产业结构调整了，人均收入也增加到300多元。这里的共产党员在群众中也有了声望。今年，中共平山县委员会号召全县党员，学习西柏坡的党员们以大公无私的奉献精神、实事求是的科学精神、团结友爱的互助精神，全心全意为乡亲们服务的事迹。
