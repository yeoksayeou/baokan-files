After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, some Western countries imposed sanctions on us, such as freezing loans, suspending project negotiations, withdrawing investors, and advising their own tourists to "self-discipline and refrain" from coming to China, and so on. Thus, some people are worried: if foreigners don't come, what should we do about continuing to open up?

From the perspective of some short-term situations, there are indeed some concerns. However, if we look at the overall picture and the long-term view, we can say that the opening up of China, with its 1.1 billion people, is not only a necessity for our country's political and economic development but also a necessity for the development of international politics and economics. The key here is still to rely on our solid work.

Without going too far back, let's look at the facts of the past two months: On June 28, shortly after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, while the international sanctions were still echoing, Shenzhen held the second Litchi Festival Trade Fair. In 10 days, 46 joint venture projects were signed with foreign businesses, with a total investment of over 400 million yuan in agreements and intentions. Immediately after that, the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning, along with the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, held a foreign investment negotiation meeting in Dalian. Then, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Tourism invited more than 400 overseas travel wholesalers to discuss plans for recovery. Following that, the first Beijing International Trade Fair was held as scheduled, with more than 1,800 companies from over 20 countries and regions participating in this grand event... It cannot be denied that these activities were affected by the Western sanctions, but some activities, in terms of results, not only exceeded previous levels but also surpassed expectations. This shows that in the face of our efforts, the so-called "sanctions" cannot achieve the goals of some people.

Many far-sighted foreign businessmen have always maintained their sincerity in doing business with China. Their welcome and affirmation by the Chinese people are well-deserved. We have also noticed that recently, some countries have gradually lifted the "do not travel to China" advisory... As time goes by, the facts will increasingly prove: sanctions are ineffective, isolation is futile, and the trend of China's opening up to the outside world is irreversible.

When faced with difficulties, what we need is not sighs, but a pragmatic spirit and better actual actions of opening up to dispel the doubts of the world and strengthen our own confidence.

Currently, the obstacles set by some people in our opening up to the outside world are indeed bad, but if we seize this opportunity to seriously summarize past experiences and lessons, and do the necessary adjustment work, such as in foreign trade, to quickly straighten out relationships and rectify order; in tourism, to quickly train employees and improve service quality, solve new problems brought by the rapid development of tourism in the past few years, and focus on long-term strategies while addressing short-term issues; in the investment environment, to further improve and perfect it, and so on. Solid work on the ground will not only help overcome current difficulties but also create better conditions for future development.

In summary, it is better to stand up and act than to sit and sigh. Let us take one step at a time, overcoming obstacles, and forge ahead on the path of continued opening up!

    继续开放要着眼于做实事
    成城
    平息发生在北京的反革命暴乱后，某些西方国家对我们实行制裁，诸如冻结贷款，中断项目洽谈，撤离投资者，劝告本国游客“自律自戒”不来中国等等。于是有人担心，我们坚持开放，人家不来怎么办？
    从短时间内的某些情况来看，确实有些令人担心，但是只要全面看，放眼看，我们可以这样说，11亿人口的中国的开放，不仅是我国政治、经济发展的需要，也是国际政治、经济发展的需要。这里的关键，仍然要靠我们扎扎实实地工作。
    远的不说，就看最近两个多月发生的事实吧：6月28日，北京平息反革命暴乱不久，国际制裁声浪尚在喧嚣，深圳市即举办了第二届荔枝节贸易洽谈会。10天当中，与外商签订了46个合资项目，协议和意向投资额超过4亿元。紧接着，北疆的黑吉辽、内蒙古三省一区在大连召开了外商投资洽谈会。随后，北京市旅游局一举邀请400多位海外旅游批发商前来共商重振大计。再继之，首届北京国际博览会如期召开，20多个国家和地区的1800多个厂家参加了这一盛会……不可否认，这些活动因西方国家的制裁而受到影响，但有的活动从效果看，不仅超过以往，而且超过预想。这说明，在我们的努力面前，所谓的“制裁”并不能达到某些人的目的。
    许多有远见的外商，始终没有放弃同中国谈生意、做生意的诚意，他们受到中国人民的欢迎和肯定是理所当然的。我们也注意到，最近有的国家，已经逐步解除“不要到中国去旅游”的劝告……随着时间的推移，事实会越来越清楚地证明：制裁是无效的，孤立是枉然的，中国对外开放的大趋势不可逆转。
    困难当头，我们需要的不是叹息，我们需要的是以务实的精神和更好地开放的实际行动，解除世人的疑虑，增强自己的信心。
    当前对外开放遇到某些人设置的障碍固然是坏事，但如果我们抓住这个时机，认真总结过去的经验教训，做好必要的调整工作，例如在外贸方面，抓紧理顺关系，整顿秩序；在旅游方面，抓紧培训员工，提高服务质量，解决前几年旅游超速发展带来的新问题，压长线，上短线；在投资环境上，做进一步的完善和改进等等。脚踏实地的工作，既有助于克服眼前的困难，也为下一步的发展创造更好的条件。
    总之，坐而叹不如起而行。让我们一步一个脚印踏过荆棘，在继续开放的道路上勇往直前！
