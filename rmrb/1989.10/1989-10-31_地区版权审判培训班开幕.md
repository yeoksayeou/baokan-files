A regional copyright judgment training class, attended by legal professionals from over a dozen countries in the Asia-Pacific region, opened today in Beijing.

This training class is jointly organized by China's Supreme People's Court, the National Copyright Administration, and the World Intellectual Property Organization of the United Nations. Judges, prosecutors, lawyers, professors, and experts from the United States and Sweden will conduct lectures through thematic reports and mock trials. Over 100 judges, lawyers, and copyright experts from more than ten countries and regions, including China, will attend as auditors.

At the opening ceremony, the President of the Supreme People's Court, Ren Jianxin, and the Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization, Arpad Bogsch, both delivered speeches.

In discussing China's copyright judgment work, Ren Jianxin stated that since the implementation of the "General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China," copyright disputes and cases have been increasing year by year. In the past three years, the people's courts have accepted over 400 first-instance copyright cases. Additionally, a large number of copyright disputes have been mediated by the national copyright authorities, protecting the legal rights of copyright owners and promoting the development of science and culture.

Ren Jianxin also revealed that China's legislative bodies are currently drafting a copyright law.

　　地区版权审判培训班开幕
    本报北京10月30日讯　记者毛磊、张志业报道：有亚太地区十几个国家法律界人士参加的“地区版权审判培训班”，今天在北京开幕。
    这一培训班是由我国最高人民法院、国家版权局和联合国世界知识产权组织联合举办的。来自美国、瑞典的法官、检察官、律师、教授、专家将通过专题报告和模拟审判的形式进行授课。包括中国在内的十多个国家和地区的法官、律师及版权专家100余人参加旁听。
    最高人民法院院长任建新、联合国世界知识产权组织总干事鲍格胥在今天的开幕式上分别致辞。
    在介绍中国版权审判工作时，任建新说，《中华人民共和国民法通则》颁布实施后，版权纠纷和案件逐年有所上升。近3年来，人民法院受理的一审版权案件已达400多件，还有大量的版权纠纷经国家版权部门作了调处，保护了版权所有人的合法权益，促进了科学文化事业的发展。
    任建新还透露，我国立法部门正抓紧拟定版权法草案。
