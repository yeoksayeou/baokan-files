Every time the critical period for drought relief and irrigation arrives, many farmers are troubled by the task of drilling wells. Not only does drilling a large well with a big auger tire out one's back and legs, but even drilling a hand-operated well requires eight or nine strong men to hug the drill rod and shout "Hey ya" for half a day.

The Jiancheng County Machinery Factory in Henan spent a year developing a small, mobile drilling rig. This product uses the diesel engine from a walk-behind tractor as its power source. When drilling, the diesel engine drives the drilling rig; when moving, the walk-behind tractor "carries" the drilling rig. It combines the advantages of large auger, water jet rotary, and vehicle-mounted drilling rigs, as well as walk-behind tractors. In the past, drilling a well required dozens of people, but now only three are needed; in the past, it took two or three days to drill one well, but now it only takes two hours. Additionally, it can choose different diameters (30-60 cm) and depths (7-50 m) of wells according to irrigation needs.

    新型钻机打眼井　只需三人两小时
    本报讯　每到抗旱浇地的节骨眼上，许多农民都为打井犯愁。不光打机井推大锅锥累得腰酸腿疼，就连打个手压井，也得八九个汉子抱着锥杆“嗨哟”半晌午。
    河南项城县机械厂费了一年功夫，最近研制出小型移动式钻井机。该产品以手扶拖拉机上的柴油机为动力源。打井时，柴油机带动钻井机工作；转移时，手扶拖拉机“背”着钻井机跑。它集大锅锥式、水冲转式、汽车式钻井机及手扶拖拉机的优点于一身。过去打一眼井要几十个人，现在三个人就行；过去一眼井打两三天，现在只要两小时。另外，可根据灌溉需要选择不同直径（30—60厘米）、不同深度（7—50米）的井眼。　（赵明　张功林）
