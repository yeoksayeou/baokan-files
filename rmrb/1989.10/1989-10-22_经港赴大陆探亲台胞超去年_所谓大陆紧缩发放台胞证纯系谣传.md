Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 21st.

From January to October 20th of this year, the number of Taiwanese visiting the mainland via Hong Kong for family visits and tourism has reached over 450,000, a 35% increase compared to the same period last year, surpassing the total number for the entire year last year. It is estimated that the total number of Taiwanese visiting the mainland this year will reach 550,000.

Today, the deputy general manager of the China Travel Service in Hong Kong, Zhao Fei, told reporters that currently, an average of 2,000 people apply for the "Travel Permit for Taiwanese Compatriots" through this location daily.

Regarding recent rumors in Taiwan that the mainland is tightening the issuance of permits for Taiwanese and that "to prevent mainland pro-democracy activists from leaving the country," Zhao Fei believes these claims are groundless. He said that the requirement for Taiwanese entering the mainland via Hong Kong to have two entry visas is not a new regulation and is not part of a tightening policy. Because the Taiwanese authorities refuse to implement "three links" with the mainland and do not allow Taiwanese citizens to come directly to the mainland, they must go through a third region. Since they must go through a third region, they naturally need visas. To ensure that Taiwanese can travel to the mainland smoothly and return to Taiwan smoothly, it has been stipulated from the beginning that two Hong Kong visas are required. The procedures for tens of thousands of Taiwanese who have returned to the mainland for family visits and tourism have all been handled this way.

Zhao Fei believes that as members of the tourism industry, we all need to provide the best service for the exchanges between compatriots on both sides of the strait. We will further establish direct business relationships and cooperation with travel agencies, airlines, and other service institutions in Taiwan to better contribute to the exchanges between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

### 经港赴大陆探亲台胞超去年  所谓大陆紧缩发放台胞证纯系谣传

　　经港赴大陆探亲台胞超去年
　　所谓大陆紧缩发放台胞证纯系谣传
    新华社香港十月二十一日电  （记者端木来娣）记者今天从香港中国旅行社获悉，从今年元月至十月二十日，经香港赴大陆探亲观光的台湾同胞已达四十五万余人次，比去年同期增加百分之三十五，超过去年全年的总数。预计今年全年返大陆探亲观光的台胞将达到五十五万人次。
    香港中旅社副总经理赵飞今天接受记者采访时说，现在每日经此地申请办理“台湾同胞旅行证明”的平均二千人左右。
    关于台湾最近传闻大陆紧缩发放台胞证、谣传“为防范大陆民运人士离境”等问题，赵飞认为是毫无根据的。他说，要求由香港地区进入大陆的台胞，必须备有两次入港签证才可取得台胞证，并不是新的规定，更不是紧缩政策。因为台湾当局拒绝与大陆实行“三通”，不准台湾民众直接来大陆，而必须经过第三地区。既然要经过第三地区，当然必须有签证。为了让台湾同胞能够顺利地前往大陆，又顺利地返回台湾，从一开始就规定必须要有两次香港签证，几十万回大陆探亲旅游台胞的手续都是这么办的。
    赵飞认为，作为旅游业者，我们都要为两岸同胞的交往提供最好的服务。我们将进一步与台湾的旅行社、航空公司等服务机构建立直接的业务关系和合作，更好地为促进海峡两岸人民交流作出贡献。
