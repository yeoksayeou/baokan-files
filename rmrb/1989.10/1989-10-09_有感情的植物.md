Experiments conducted in Australia, the United States, and the Soviet Union have shown that plants have sensations and can respond to human emotions and language, even to the extent of "singing."

Dr. Evans of Queensland University in Australia connected a device similar to a hospital heart monitor to a geranium. He praised a little girl sitting next to the geranium for being beautiful, and the girl smiled. He then asked her to compliment the flower, at which point the needle on the monitor moved. Next, he told the girl that she had encountered a terrible blizzard but was not wearing a coat, and the girl shivered. The monitor's needle moved again. Several other devices not connected to the geranium showed no reaction to the girl's emotions. Many scientists believe that plants have a primitive nervous system.

Professor Ulasov of Leningrad University in the Soviet Union, through his experiments, believes that certain plants capture insects for food or cause insects to fall off when they touch them, which is a protective behavior of the plants. Recognizing that plants have sensations can help improve the cultivation of plants, protect orchards, and preserve forests.

Engineer Kisel of the California Plant Research Institute in the United States points out that plants produce sounds as beautiful as a flute, with their tones and melodies varying according to the environment, depending on whether the plants feel happy with the people present. The most responsive plant to this is the hairy-leafed begonia.

Many gardeners know that talking to plants can affect their growth. Some people in Britain who grow large leeks say that after spending entire nights talking to them, the leeks' growth is noticeably affected.

For several years, researchers at Utrecht University in the Netherlands have experimented with weeds' reactions to praise and criticism. They played recordings of singing and praise continuously for 24 hours a day for a month on a plot of land covered with stinging nettles and white grass. Almost all the weeds bloomed and grew vigorously, with one plant even growing 10 new leaves. On another plot of land, people constantly scolded the weeds, resulting in the weeds gradually withering and eventually dying.

    “有感情的植物”
    澳大利亚、美国、苏联等国的试验表明，植物也有感觉，能对人类的情感与语言等刺激作出反应，甚至会“唱歌”。
    澳大利亚昆士兰大学的埃文斯博士，用一台类似医院中测量心跳仪器的检波器与一株天竺葵联结。他夸奖坐在天竺葵旁边的小女孩子长得很漂亮，小女孩笑了，同时又让她赞美花，此时检波器上的指针摆动了。然后博士对女孩说，她遇到了可怕的暴风雪，但没穿大衣，女孩颤抖起来，这时检波器的指针又动了。而另外几台仪器没有与天竺葵相联结，面对女孩的激情没有任何反应。许多科学家认为，植物有初级的神经系统。
    苏联列宁格勒大学乌拉索夫教授经过试验认为，某些植物抓住虫子当食物，或虫子碰到它时落下来，这是植物的保护行为。如果能认识植物有感觉的这一特征，有助于改良植物的种植、保护果园和森林。
    美国加利福尼亚植物研究所的基塞尔工程师指出，植物会产生如同笛子一样美妙的声音，其音调和旋律根据环境而不同，这取决于植物对在场的人是否感到愉快。对此反应最明显的是毛叶秋海棠。
    许多园丁知道，对植物讲话会影响其生长。英国一些种大韭菜的人说，在他们整夜整夜坐在菜地边与其说话之后，能够明显地影响韭菜的长势。
    荷兰乌特里奇大学几年来试验杂草对赞扬与批评的反应。他们在一块长着大荨麻和白草的地上，每天24小时不间断地放唱歌与赞美的录音带，整整一个月，几乎所有的草都开花了，而且生长茂盛，有一棵竟长出10片新叶。在另一块草地，人们面对野草总是怒气冲冲，结果草慢慢枯萎，以至死亡。
