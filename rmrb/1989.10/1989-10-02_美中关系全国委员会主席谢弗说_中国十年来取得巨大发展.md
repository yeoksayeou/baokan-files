    中国十年来取得巨大发展
    本报华盛顿9月30日电  记者张亮报道：在中华人民共和国成立40周年前夕，美中关系全国委员会主席谢弗在接受本报记者采访时说，“在邓小平的领导下，中国在过去10年中阔步前进，取得了巨大的发展。这充分显示了中国人民的勤劳和智慧。”70年代末以来谢弗先生曾先后5次访华。他说每次访问中国都会发现新的积极变化。
    在华期间他曾有幸受到中国高级领导人接见。他说，这对他是一个“热情友好、富有意义”的经历。在谈到美中关系时，他认为美中两个大国经常坦诚地交换看法是极其重要的。美中关系全国委员会为此组织了多种形式的政府及民间交流活动，加深了两国人民之间的友谊和了解。他衷心希望中国局势稳定，在现代化建设中排除困难，继续大踏步前进。
