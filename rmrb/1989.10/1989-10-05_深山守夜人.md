Title: The Night Watchman of the Deep Mountains

The bright moonlight bathes the endless mountains and fields in a layer of silver glow.

In the autumn of the Dabie Mountains, the rice in the terraced fields has ripened, and the corn on the hillsides has shed its thin outer husks.

Harvest is intoxicating. The night breeze carries the fragrant scent of the ripened grains far and wide.

Suddenly, from the distant ridges, comes a series of grunts from wild boars. Perhaps they can't resist the alluring aroma of the crops and have emerged from the dense old forest to seek a nighttime meal.

"Clang, clang, clang! Clang, clang, clang!" A series of urgent gong sounds echo through the hundred peaks and thousand valleys. I know, this is the sound of the night watchman of the deep mountains. The gong is a traditional instrument for protecting the crops. At this moment, if you listen closely to the mountainside, you can hear the panting breaths of the fleeing wild boar herd.

In the valley, next to a large chestnut tree, there is a primitive-style hut. An elderly man, holding a gong, is gazing into the distance. Under the moonlight, I walk towards the night watchman. The watchman is a man in his sixties. He invites me to sit on a stone bench in front of the hut and offers me a basket of golden chestnuts...

Under the moonlight, although I can't see the wrinkles on the old man's face clearly, his skin, weathered by the sun, moon, wind, and rain, is still faintly visible. The old man speaks little, but his words are full of pride: he has a son who flies airplanes. His daughter works as an official in the provincial capital. But he can't get used to living in the city's pigeonhole-like apartments. He says he feels more at ease in the mountain valley.

His son soars in the sky. He, however, is content to patrol and guard the night in front of the hut. One is modern, the other is primitive. They are both starkly different and harmonious. I repeatedly gaze at the old man in the mountain mist.

While my thoughts are soaring, there is another disturbance on the western mountain. The old man laughs heartily, "Look, the greedy ones are back again." He raises the gong and strikes it urgently again. The sound echoes through the valleys, creating a series of melodious reverberations. After striking the gong, the old man, as if afraid of leaving me alone, picks up the conversation again:

"The county is going to send me another certificate of merit, huh, what do I need that for? Protecting the crops in the mountains is just a duty, isn't it natural?"

Saying this, he fiddles with the transistor radio hanging from his body, listening to his favorite Henan opera segment: "The air in the mountain valley is good, it's really fresh..."

This transistor radio is probably the night watchman's only modern equipment, and listening to Henan opera is his only artistic enjoyment. His dials have never been adjusted much, always lingering on those few local opera programs.

The night deepens, and the wind blows through the valleys and ridges, making the crops sway like waves.

The night watchman has no sign of sleep, his eyes are even wider and brighter. The hut nestled among the rice fields on the mountain looks like a small boat that never stops sailing.

"Clang, clang, clang!" The gong sounds again...

    深山守夜人
    潘万提
    皎洁的月光，给绵延的山野，镀上一层银晖。
    秋天的大别山区，梯田里的稻子熟了，山坡上的玉米也挣脱了薄薄的服饰。
    丰收是醉人的。夜风，将五谷成熟的馨香送得很远。
    远处的山梁上，突然传来一阵阵野猪的哼吱声。大概它们经不住作物喷香的诱惑，钻出茂密的老林寻求一顿夜餐。
    “当当当！当当当！”一阵急促的铜锣声，霎时回响在百峰千谷。我知道，这是深山守夜人敲响的。铜锣，是庄稼守护者的传统响器。这时，如果你贴着山地，会听到野猪群逃窜的呼呼喘息声。
    山坳里，一棵合抱粗的板栗树旁，搭着一架原始式的窝棚。一位老者，手掂铜锣，正向远处眺望。借着月色，我向守夜人走去。守夜的是一位六十开外的长者。他将我让在窝棚前的石凳子上落坐，掂来一篮澄黄的板栗……
    月光下，虽然看不大清楚老人面部的皱纹，但他那被日月风雨荡涤的黝黑皮肤，还是依稀可见。老人话很少，但充满骄傲：他有一个驾飞机的儿子。女儿在省城当干部。可他住不惯城市鸽子笼般的楼房，他说还是在山窝里踏实。
    儿子在天上飞翔。他却安于在窝棚前巡更守夜。一个现代，一个原始。既悬殊，又和谐。我反复端详山雾中的老人。
    在我思绪飞翔的时候，西山头上又有了响动。老人爽朗地笑了：“这不，贪吃的家伙又来了。”他扬起铜锣，又一阵急敲。声音撞在山谷，荡起阵阵悠扬的回声。敲完，老人像怕冷清了我似的，重又捡起话头：
    “乡里又要给我送奖状，嘿，我要那玩艺儿干啥？山里人看庄稼，尽尽义务，还不是人之常情呀！”说着，他拨弄挂在身上的半导体收音机，听着他百听不厌的豫剧选段：“山沟里，空气好，实在新鲜……”
    这个半导体，恐怕是守夜者唯一的现代装备，听豫剧，也算是他唯一的艺术享受了。他的波段，从没作大调整，总是徘徊在那少有的几个地方戏曲节目上。
    夜深了，山风过处，沟沟岭岭的稼禾波浪起伏。
    守夜人毫无睡意，眼睛睁得更圆更亮了。簇拥在山地稻海中的窝棚，好似一艘不会停泊的小艇。
    “当当当！”锣声又起……
