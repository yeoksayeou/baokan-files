A farewell ceremony for painters Zhao Yixiong and Geng Yujun, who are embarking on a sketching tour along the Silk Road, was held on the morning of October 10 at the Beijing Painting Academy. The painters, both over fifty years old, will personally drive a domestically produced car through seven provinces and visit Pakistan, sketching along the way. This is the first time in the country that a painter has driven themselves to sketch along the Silk Road.

The ceremony was attended by officials from the Beijing Painting Academy, as well as friends and family of the painters. Zhao Yixiong and Geng Yujun expressed their gratitude for the support and encouragement they have received, and shared their excitement and anticipation for the journey ahead. They plan to document their experiences and create a series of sketches and paintings based on their travels, which they hope will inspire others to appreciate the beauty and cultural richness of the Silk Road.
