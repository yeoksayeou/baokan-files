On October 21, U.S. President Bush signed a bill to provide $9 million in "aid" to the Nicaraguan opposition to help it participate in next February's elections. The U.S. action was condemned by the Nicaraguan National Assembly. Nicaragua demanded that the United States respect the decisions of the Central American Five Nations Summit, refrain from interfering in Nicaragua's election process, and hand over the money to the International Support and Verification Commission to promote peace and democracy in the region. Nicaragua's aforementioned suggestions are reasonable and beneficial for coordinating relations between the United States and Central American countries.

However, the United States only believes in the logic of power. It is clear that the United States is using its dollars to intervene in Nicaragua's internal affairs and interfere in the domestic politics of another country, yet the White House spokesman stated in a declaration that the money given to the Nicaraguan opposition is to ensure a "truly free and fair election." One must ask, on what grounds does the United States have the right to interfere in the internal elections of a sovereign state? In the minds of some U.S. rulers, principles such as mutual respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs have been thrown to the wind.

During the House of Representatives' debate on this bill, the legislators supporting the provision of "aid" to the Nicaraguan opposition asserted that without this aid, the opposition "would certainly fail," but with dollars from Washington, the people they support would "guarantee victory." This is wishful thinking. To say nothing else, the United States has already sent billions of dollars to the Nicaraguan anti-government forces, with what result? Dollars are not omnipotent.

In fact, the United States, under the banner of "supporting democracy," has frequently used its greenbacks to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. However, Washington's actions are becoming less and less effective, and the opposition they face is growing stronger with each passing day. Because the times have changed.

　　强权逻辑
    10月21日，美国总统布什签署一项法案，向尼加拉瓜反对派提供900万美元的“援助”，帮助它参加明年2月的选举。美国的做法遭到尼加拉瓜国民议会的谴责。尼加拉瓜要求美国尊重中美洲5国首脑会议的决议，不要干涉尼选举进程，将这笔钱交给国际支持与核查委员会，以促进中美洲地区的和平与民主。尼加拉瓜的上述建议合情合理，有利于协调美国与中美洲国家的关系。
    然而，美国只信强权逻辑。分明是美国利用它手中的美元插手尼加拉瓜的内部事务，干涉别国内政，而白宫发言人却在声明中说，拨给尼反对派这笔钱是为了保证“进行一场真正自由、公平的选举”。试问，一个主权国家的内部选举美国凭什么要横加干预？在某些美国执政者的心目中，什么相互尊重国家主权，什么互不干涉内政，统统被抛到九霄云外了。
    在众议院辩论这项议案时，支持向尼加拉瓜反对派提供“援助”的议员们认定，没有这笔援助，尼反对派“肯定会遭到失败”，而有了来自华盛顿的美元，他们所支持的人就能“胜利在握”。这是一厢情愿。别的不说，美国迄今送给尼加拉瓜反政府武装的钱少说也有数亿美元之巨，结果又如何呢？美元并不是万能的。
    其实，美国打着“支持民主”的旗号，挥动手中绿票干涉他国内政已不乏其例。但华盛顿的做法越来越不见效，而遭到的反对却一次比一次强烈。因为时代不同了。·彦忠·
