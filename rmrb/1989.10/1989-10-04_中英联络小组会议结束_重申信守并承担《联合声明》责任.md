The 13th meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group was held in London from September 27 to 29.

The news release issued after the meeting stated, “The Joint Liaison Group exchanged extensive and frank views on the developments in Hong Kong since the 12th meeting. Both sides agreed that the full and faithful implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong question is the fundamental guarantee for the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and reaffirmed their commitment to uphold and fulfill the responsibilities stipulated in the Joint Declaration.”

The release also said, “The Joint Liaison Group reviewed the outstanding issues since the 12th meeting, which is beneficial for the future work of the Joint Liaison Group.”

The Joint Liaison Group also decided to hold its 14th meeting in Hong Kong from December 5 to 8 this year.

The 13th meeting of the Sino-British Liaison Group was originally scheduled to be held in London in July. After the Beijing government suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion in June, Britain unilaterally announced the postponement of the meeting, disrupting the normal work of the Joint Liaison Group. The Chinese government had expressed regret over this.

    中英联络小组会议结束
    重申信守并承担《联合声明》责任
    新华社伦敦10月2日电　中英联合联络小组第十三次会议从9月27日至29日在伦敦举行。
    会后发表的新闻公报说，“联合联络小组就第十二次会议以来香港局势的发展广泛和坦率地交换了意见。双方认为，切实贯彻执行中英关于香港问题的联合声明是维护香港长期繁荣稳定的根本保证，并重申将始终不渝地信守并承担《联合声明》所规定的各项责任。”
    公报说，“联合联络小组还就第十二次会议以来尚待解决的议题作了一般回顾，这对今后联合联络小组的工作是有益的。”
    联合联络小组还决定于今年12月5日至8日在香港举行第十四次会议。
    中英联络小组第十三次会议原定于今年7月在伦敦举行。在6月北京平息反革命暴乱之后，英国单方面宣布推迟会议，中断了联合联络小组的正常工作。中国政府曾对此表示遗憾。
