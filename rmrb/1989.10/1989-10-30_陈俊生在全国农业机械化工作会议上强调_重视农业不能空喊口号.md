People's Daily, Beijing, October 29th, Reporter Jiang Xia: Vice Premier Chen Junsheng pointed out sternly at the closing of the national agricultural mechanization conference today that prioritizing agriculture cannot be just empty slogans. For issues that agriculture urgently needs to solve, relevant departments that can handle them should expedite their resolution; for issues that cannot be resolved immediately, they should think of more ways and ideas to facilitate them as much as possible. Those in charge of finances and materials should not easily exercise veto power.

Chen Junsheng said that currently and in the foreseeable future, China's agricultural development faces a very severe situation. The core issue is the contradiction between the increasing demand for agricultural products and the supply capacity. The ultimate solution to this problem not only relies on the enthusiasm of farmers but also on improving the productivity of agriculture. The increase in grain production in the six years following the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee was significantly due to the Household Contract Responsibility System, but it is also important not to overlook the comprehensive investment in agriculture at that time. The agricultural water conservancy facilities accumulated over many years and the deep plowing layer developed by agricultural machinery played a significant role after the implementation of the Household Contract Responsibility System. Whether agriculture has momentum for development and whether grain production can reach a new level mainly depends on the improvement of comprehensive agricultural production capacity.

Currently, the agricultural machinery industry and agricultural mechanization face some difficulties and problems. Some of these issues, if not resolved quickly, will directly affect agricultural production this winter and next spring. Regarding the difficulty in implementing policies that favor agriculture, Chen Junsheng emphasized that industrial policies must be genuinely implemented. First, there must be a mindset that prioritizes agriculture. Without food, nothing can be accomplished. Agriculture is a constraint on the development of the national economy, and developing agriculture is not just the responsibility of the agricultural sector but a shared task of all industries. Second, all business departments should adjust their economic and business structures, such as investment structure, credit structure, material allocation structure, and tax structure, in accordance with industrial policies, and genuinely prioritize agriculture. Third, relevant departments of the State Council and local governments at all levels should prioritize the supply of energy and raw materials needed for the production of fertilizers, pesticides, plastic films, and agricultural machinery. In a situation where funds and materials are limited, the priority should be to ensure food and agriculture. Agricultural industrial departments must resolutely complete the production and supply tasks assigned by the state. Provinces, cities, prefectures, and counties should use a significant portion of their local discretionary funds for agricultural construction.

　　陈俊生在全国农业机械化工作会议上强调
　　重视农业不能空喊口号
    本报北京10月29日讯　记者江夏报道：国务委员陈俊生在今天闭幕的全国农业机械化工作会议上严肃指出，重视农业不能空喊口号。对农业急需解决的问题，有关业务部门能够办到的要抓紧办；一时办不到的，也要多想办法，多出主意，尽量开绿灯。管钱管物的同志不要轻易使用否决权。
    陈俊生说，目前和今后相当长的一个时期，我国农业发展面临的形势是相当严峻的。核心的问题是对农产品不断增长的需求和供给能力的矛盾。问题的最终解决，不仅要靠农民的积极性，还要靠提高农业的生产力水平。党的十一届三中全会以后前6年粮食的增产，家庭联产承包责任制起了关键性的作用，但也不能忽视那时对农业的综合投入。多年积累起来的农田水利设施和多年农机开发的深耕层的作用，在实行家庭联产承包责任制以后得到了充分发挥。农业发展有没有后劲，粮食生产能不能上一个新的台阶，主要取决于农业综合生产能力的提高。
    目前，农机工业和农机化面临一些困难和问题，有的如不尽快解决会直接影响到今冬明春的农业生产。谈到向农业倾斜的政策难于落实的一些情况，陈俊生强调，要真正落实产业政策。第一，必须从思想上倾斜。没有饭吃，什么事情也办不成。农业是制约国民经济发展的产业，发展农业决不仅仅是农业部门自己的事，而是各行各业的共同任务。第二，各业务部门要按产业政策的要求，对本部门的经济业务结构，如投资结构，信贷结构，物资分配结构，税收结构进行调整，切实向农业倾斜。第三，国务院各有关部门和地方各级政府对化肥、农药、农膜、农机等生产所需的能源、原材料要优先保证供应。在钱和物就那么多的情况下，首先要保吃饭、保农业。农用工业部门要坚决完成国家计划的生产和供应任务。省、市、地、县都要把大部分地方机动财力用于农业建设。
