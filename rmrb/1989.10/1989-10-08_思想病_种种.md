The Party Committee of the Construction Commission of Dan Yang City, Jiangsu, reviewed and summarized the social phenomena of recent years and the various erroneous tendencies in the ideological realm within their system, identifying "fifteen ailments":

"Love of Wealth Disease." They always think that socialism is not as good as capitalism, always talking about foreign countries and the West, denying their own achievements, blindly worshipping foreign things, and lacking patriotism and national pride.

"Gray Mood Disease." They deny everything. Whenever anti-corruption is mentioned, it seems that all Communist Party members are completely corrupt, spreading "gray moods" with phrases like "no official is upright, no official is not greedy."

"Complaint Disease." They find fault with everything, always have complaints to make, and never stop grumbling.

"Money Worship Disease." They believe that "everything revolves around money," only caring about money and not about personal dignity.

"Empty Talk Disease." They talk a lot but do nothing, boast and bluff, are detached from reality, and engage in armchair strategizing.

"False Accusation Disease." They fabricate facts and make false accusations everywhere.

"Gossip Disease." They love to spread rumors, do not believe official news, and readily believe street gossip.

"Nitpicking Disease." They always focus on others, do not do their own work, and criticize and judge those who do, even finding faults in the smallest details.

"Selfish Disease." They only care about their own interests, do not uphold the "Spirit of Lei Feng," and do not embody communist ethics.

"Sabotage Disease." They engage in backstabbing, racking their brains to sabotage others.

"Loose Lips Disease." They lack discipline and reveal party secrets indiscriminately.

"Gossiping Disease." They have long tongues and spread a lot of idle talk, affecting unity.

"Envy Disease." They envy those who are more capable, get jealous when others are promoted, and fear being surpassed by others.

"Suspicion Disease." They do not trust each other and harbor suspicions, making wild guesses based on narrow-minded perspectives.

"Lazy and Greedy Disease." They are lazy, greedy, and love to play. The masses say they are "lazybones" at work, "heroes" at the dining table, and "tough guys" at the card table.

专栏：

    “思想病”种种
    江苏丹阳市建委党委联系近几年的社会现象和本系统在思想领域中出现的种种错误倾向进行回顾总结，归纳出“十五种病症”：
    “爱资病”。总觉得社会主义不如资本主义，开口外国，闭口“西方”，否定自己，盲目崇洋，缺乏爱国主义思想和民族自豪感。
    “灰色病”。否定一切，一说反腐败，似乎共产党员都坏透了，“无官不倒，无官不贪”，散布“灰色情绪”。
    “牢骚病”。看什么都不顺眼，有说不尽的怪话，发不完的牢骚。
    “拜金病”。“一切向钱看”，光要“票子”，不要人格面子。
    “清谈病”。光说不干，吹牛放炮，脱离实际，纸上谈兵。
    “诬告病”。无中生有，捏造事实，到处诬告。
    “信谣病”。爱信谣，中央的消息不信，对“马路消息”一听就信。
    “挑剔病”。整天眼睛盯着别人，自己不干工作，看见干工作的同志便说三道四，评头论足，甚至“鸡蛋里挑骨头”。
    “利己病”。一切为了自己的私利，不讲“雷锋精神”，不讲共产主义风格。
    “拆台病”。背后搞小动作，绞尽脑汁拆别人的台。
    “漏嘴病”。没有纪律约束，信口开河，把党的机密随便泄露。
    “传舌病”。“舌头长，闲话多”，影响团结。
    “嫉妒病”。对能力强的人，心怀嫉妒，看见别人提拔就眼红，唯恐别人超过自己。
    “猜疑病”。互不信任，互相猜疑。凭个人狭隘的眼光去胡猜乱想。
    “馋懒病”。又懒又馋又贪玩。群众说他们是工作上的
    “懒汉”，酒桌上的“好汉”，牌桌上的“硬汉”。
