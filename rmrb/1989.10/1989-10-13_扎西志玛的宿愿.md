In Hunan's Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County, no matter where you go, you will hear people saying, "It was Doctor Zaxi who gave me a second life."

This beloved Tibetan doctor, Zaxi Zhim, is from Ganzi, Sichuan. In 1961, she graduated from Beijing Medical College and was assigned to work in the obstetrics and gynecology department of Beijing Friendship Hospital. The following year, she married her classmate Yang Wenqin, who had come from a poor mountain village in Xinhuang to work at the hospital.

In the winter of 1968, this couple, who shared the same ideals, endured a half-month journey of hardships to arrive at the long-awaited Dong village. They were assigned to work at the medical clinic in Fulu Township, 60 kilometers away from the county seat.

The medical conditions here were even worse than she had imagined. The hospital was a makeshift of a few dilapidated wooden houses, with only 8 medical staff and not a single piece of medical equipment. Doctor Zaxi was not deterred by the difficulties before her. As soon as she arrived, she made up her mind to settle down in Dong village. For 21 years, she braved wind and rain, walked through the night, and whenever she heard a call for help, she would rush to the patient's side without hesitation, regardless of the distance. In Fangxi Village, Fulu Township, a villager's first wife died in childbirth. His current wife was also in labor. The villager came to Doctor Zaxi in the middle of the night seeking help. Without a moment's hesitation, she gathered a few helpers, took a lantern, and rushed to the patient's home to perform an emergency cesarean section.

In 1972, Doctor Zaxi was transferred to the obstetrics and gynecology department of the county people's hospital. At that time, the county's medical conditions were not much better than the township's. There were no obstetrics and gynecology doctors, only three midwives handling outpatient services. To change this situation, she not only actively suggested the addition of equipment but also taught the obstetrics and gynecology course at the county health school, actively engaged in medical research, and trained nearly 500 maternal and child health workers for Dong village. In 1980, she successfully performed the Rhesus-negative amniotic cavity injection for mid-term pregnancy induction, with a success rate of 99%.

Over 21 years, Doctor Zaxi treated 160,000 patients in Dong village, performed over 10,000 surgeries, and saved more than 10,000 Dong women from the brink of death.

She has been consecutively awarded the honor of National, Provincial, and Municipal Ethnic Unity and Progress Advanced Individual for several years. When asked about her greatest feeling over these years, she always said with deep emotion: "I love the simple Dong people and am willing to dedicate my life to my second hometown."

    扎西志玛的宿愿
    江东臻
    在湖南新晃侗族自治县，不论走到哪里，都会听到有人说，“是扎西医师给了我第二次生命。”
    这位深为侗族同胞热爱的藏族医生扎西志玛，是四川甘孜人。1961年毕业于北京医学院，分配到北京友谊医院妇产科工作。第二年，与新晃穷山沟里来的留院工作的同班同学杨文钦结了婚。
    1968年初冬，这对志同道合的夫妇，经过半个月的旅途颠簸，来到了向往已久的侗乡。他们夫妇俩被安排在离县城60公里的扶罗乡医院。
    这里的医疗条件比她想象中的还要落后。医院由几间破木房拼合而成，只有8名医护人员，没有一台医疗设备。扎西医生没有被眼前的困难吓倒，一到这里，便定下了扎根侗乡的决心。21年如一日，风里来，雨里去，摸三更，走半夜，只要听到病人的呼唤，她不辞山高路远，总是随喊随到。扶罗乡仗溪村一个村民前妻难产身亡，现在的妻子又难产，他深夜来求扎西医生救他妻子。扎西二话没说，马上喊了几个帮手，提着马灯，赶到产妇家中，及时做了切开手术。1972年，扎西医生调到县人民医院妇产科工作。当时，县里的医疗条件比乡里好不了多少。没有妇产科医师，只有三个助产士看门诊。为了改变这种状况，她除了积极建议增添设备外，还担任县卫校妇产科课程的教学，积极从事医学研究，为侗乡培养了一支近500人的妇幼保健队伍。1980年，她成功地移植了雷夫诺尔羊膜腔内注射中期妊娠引产术，成功率达99％。
    21年，扎西医生为侗乡人民看病16万人次，完成大小手术1万多例，使1万多名在死亡线上挣扎的侗家女转危为安。
    她连续几年获得中央、省、地民族团结进步先进个人的荣誉，别人问她这些年最大的感受是什么？她总是充满感情地说：“我热爱淳朴的侗家人，愿把毕生精力献给我的第二故乡。”
