The Taif Conference, after repeated debates, passed the Lebanese national reconciliation compromise document.

    Reports from Damascus and Cairo, October 23: Correspondents Lü Zhixing and Lin Jiaoming report: In Taif, Saudi Arabia, news has come that yesterday night, Lebanese deputies participating in the Taif Conference held an expanded meeting and voted by a show of hands on the Lebanese national reconciliation charter drafted by the Arab League's three-party committee. In a vote attended by 61 deputies, except for two who left before the vote and one who abstained, the reconciliation charter was unanimously approved.

    It is reported that a drafting committee consisting of 17 deputies had extensive discussions and consultations with deputies from both sides and made slight modifications to the original text of the reconciliation charter, finally gaining the approval of the majority of deputies, thus achieving a successful outcome for the Taif Conference, which had lasted 23 days. The charter will be submitted to the Lebanese Parliament for approval and will become a constitutional document after being passed by the Parliament.

    It is expected that the Lebanese deputies will move to Jeddah to attend the closing ceremony chaired by Saudi King Fahd tomorrow and announce the achievement of the Lebanese national reconciliation charter.

    The main contents of the Lebanese national reconciliation document include: the reconciliation government will, within one year, rely on the national regular army to exercise sovereignty throughout the country; disband all armed groups of various factions; acknowledge the "special brotherly relationship" between Syria and Lebanon, with Syrian troops "within a limited period of two years" helping the Lebanese national army to restore sovereignty. After the election of the president, the establishment of the reconciliation government, and the implementation of political reform clauses, Syrian troops will withdraw to the Bekaa Valley. The duration and number of Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon thereafter will be negotiated separately. The reconciliation document does not specify the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, nor does it reveal the content of Syria's "necessary guarantees." This is the main reason why the Oren military government refused the document.

    Speaker Hussein presided over the parliamentary plenary session last night, with 62 Lebanese Muslim and Christian deputies (excluding one on sick leave) participating in the vote. The national reconciliation document was passed with 52 votes in favor.

    The Parliament will provide the formal text of the reconciliation document to the Hussein temporary government and the Oren military government and invite them to attend the parliamentary closing ceremony in Jeddah. The special envoy of the three-party committee, Ibrahim, has already flown to Beirut today to arrange the next steps for the final approval of the national reconciliation document.

    It is reported that this document, after being agreed upon by all parties within the country, will be approved through constitutional procedures in Beirut one week later and will come into effect one month later, with the election of a new president, prime minister, and national reconciliation government. However, the Oren military government refused this document, accusing the document's provisions on Lebanese sovereignty as "unacceptable."

　　塔伊夫会议经过反复争论
　　通过黎巴嫩民族和解妥协文件
    综合本报大马士革、开罗10月23日电  记者吕志星、林皎明报道：沙特阿拉伯塔伊夫消息：昨天夜里，参加塔伊夫会议的黎巴嫩议员举行了扩大会议，并以举手方式对阿盟三方委员会制定的黎巴嫩全国和解宪章进行表决。在有61名议员参加的表决中，除两名议员在表决前退场和另一名议员弃权外，和解宪章获得一致同意。
    据报道，有17名议员组成的起草委员会，同两派议员进行了充分的讨论和磋商，并对和解宪章的原文作了稍许的修改后，终于得到大多数议员的同意，从而使持续了23天的塔伊夫会议取得圆满的结果。该宪章将提交黎议会，由黎议会会议通过后，将成为宪法性的文件。
    预计，黎议员们将转到吉达市，参加明日由沙特国王法赫德主持的闭幕会议，并宣布黎巴嫩全国和解宪章的达成。
    黎巴嫩全国和解文件的主要内容包括：和解政府在1年时间内依靠国家正规军在全境行使主权；解散所有各派武装；承认叙利亚与黎巴嫩的“特殊兄弟关系”，叙利亚军队“在限定的两年时间内”帮助黎国家军队恢复主权，在选出总统、建立和解政府和实行政治改革条款后，叙军撤至黎贝卡谷地。叙军此后在黎境内的驻扎时间和人数另行商定。和解文件没有规定叙军全部撤出黎境的时限，也没有透露叙利亚“必要保证”的内容。这是奥恩军政府拒绝文件的主要原因。
    侯赛尼议长主持昨天晚间的议会全体会议，黎巴嫩穆斯林和基督教两大派62名议员（除1人病假）参加表决。全国和解文件获52票赞成通过。
    议会将向胡斯临时政府和奥恩军政府提供和解文件正式文本，并邀请他们出席在吉达举行的议会闭幕式。三方委员会特使易卜拉希米已经在昨天飞往贝鲁特，安排全国和解文件得以最后批准的下一步骤。
    据透露，这份文件经国内各方同意，1周后在贝鲁特通过宪法程序批准生效，1个月后选举新总统、新总理和全国和解政府。但奥恩军政府拒绝这份文件，指责文件有关黎主权部分是“不能接受的”。
