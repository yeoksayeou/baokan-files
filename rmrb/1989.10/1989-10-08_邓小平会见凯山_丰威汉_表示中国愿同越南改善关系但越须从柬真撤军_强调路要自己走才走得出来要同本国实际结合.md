Deng Xiaoping Meets with Kaysone Phomvihane
Expresses China's Willingness to Improve Relations with Vietnam but Vietnam Must Withdraw from Cambodia; Emphasizes That the Path Must Be Walked by Oneself and Must Be Combined with National Reality

BEIJING, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) — "The path must be walked by oneself to come out. Some experiences of China may work in China, but not necessarily in Laos. A major experience is to closely combine with the reality of one's own country." This was what Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China said this morning when he met with Kaysone Phomvihane, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, who was visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese government.

This morning, when Kaysone Phomvihane arrived at the Great Hall of the People's Hall of Fujian, Deng Xiaoping, who had been waiting there, walked forward to greet this old friend, whom he had known since the 1950s, with a firm handshake and a warm embrace. Kaysone Phomvihane said to Deng Xiaoping, "In the 1950s, you told us to be self-reliant." Deng Xiaoping replied, "We developed in a harsh environment."

During the 75-minute meeting, Deng Xiaoping made important remarks on the issues of Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia and Sino-Vietnamese relations. Deng Xiaoping said, "Vietnam has proposed to improve relations with China as soon as possible. We have always believed that the two countries will eventually improve relations, but there is the issue of Cambodia. In fact, it is very simple: Vietnam should withdraw from Cambodia completely and thoroughly. We will not raise any other issues."

Deng Xiaoping said that China's relations with the Soviet Union have already been normalized, and relations with Laos have also improved. Now, only Vietnam is left. He said, "I do not understand why Vietnam wants to be anti-China? China is willing to improve relations with Vietnam, but Vietnam must withdraw completely. This is something that a socialist country should at least do. Only after doing this can we say 'end the past.' We have no other demands."

Deng Xiaoping went on to say, "Vietnam should open up a bit and not play tricks. Tricks are useless, and truth cannot be covered up. We know about other countries, and other countries also know about us. The practice of covering up the truth with diplomatic language is outdated. He said, "Now is the information age, and truth and falsehood can be distinguished immediately."

During the meeting, Kaysone Phomvihane also briefed Deng Xiaoping on the reforms and gradual opening-up that Laos has undertaken in recent years.

    邓小平会见凯山·丰威汉
    表示中国愿同越南改善关系但越须从柬真撤军  强调路要自己走才走得出来要同本国实际结合
    本报北京10月7日讯　记者孙毅报道：“路总是要自己走才走得出来。中国有些经验在中国行得通，在老挝就不一定行得通。一个主要的经验就是同本国的实际密切结合起来”。这是中共中央军委主席邓小平今天上午在人民大会堂会见应邀来访的老挝部长会议主席、人民革命党总书记凯山·丰威汉时讲的这番话。
    今天上午，当凯山·丰威汉同志来到人民大会堂福建厅时，等候在这里的邓小平主席迎上前去，同这位50年代就相识的老朋友紧紧握手、拥抱。凯山·丰威汉对邓小平说：“50年代您就曾和我们说过要自力更生”。邓小平说，“我们就是在艰苦环境中发展起来的”。
    在长达75分钟的会见中，邓小平主席就越南撤军、中越关系等问题发表了重要谈话。邓小平说，“越南提出要尽快同中国改善关系，我们从来都认为两国最终是要改善关系的，就是有一个柬埔寨问题。其实这很容易，就是越南从柬埔寨干干净净地、彻彻底底地撤军，别的我们都不提了”。
    邓小平主席说，我们同苏联的关系已经正常化了，同老挝也改善了关系，现在就剩下一个越南了。他说，我很不理解越南为什么要反华？中国是愿意改善同越南的关系的，但越南必须要干干净净地撤军，因为这是一个社会主义国家起码应该做的事情。做了这件事之后，才能说“结束过去”。我们没有别的要求。
    邓小平接着说，越南要想开一点，不要搞小动作，搞小动作是没有用的，真假是掩盖不了的。我们的事情别国知道，别国的事情我们也有数。用外交语言掩盖真相的做法已经过时了。他说，现在是信息时代，真假一下子就辨得出。
    会见时，凯山·丰威汉也向邓小平介绍了近年来老挝进行改革和逐步对外开放的情况。
