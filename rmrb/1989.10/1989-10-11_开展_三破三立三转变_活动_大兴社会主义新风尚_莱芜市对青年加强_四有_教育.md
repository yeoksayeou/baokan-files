This year, Laiwu City in Shandong Province has extensively launched the "Three Breaks, Three Establishments, Three Transformations" campaign among urban and rural youth across the city. This campaign has become an effective form of "Four Haves" education for young people.

Break the "everyone for themselves" mindset of the 1980s, establish the concept of "helping others," and transform interpersonal relationships from "each for themselves" to "mutual assistance." Addressing the issue of some rural military and revolutionary martyrs' families facing difficulties in farming without help, and the lack of volunteers for good deeds in society, Laiwu City has organized extensive discussions among youth on the topics "Should we advocate communist ideology in the primary stage of socialism?" and "Should the spirit of Lei Feng in the 1980s continue to be carried forward?" These discussions guide everyone to educate themselves. The city has established 9,900 "Learn from Lei Feng" groups, "Warmth Delivery" groups, and "Volunteer Assistance Teams." In the first nine months of this year, over 13,000 good deeds have emerged, including voluntary care for elderly widows, helping impoverished households repair and build houses, and taking care of military and revolutionary martyrs' farmland. The phrase "Everyone helps each other, every household helps each other, and everyone helps the military and revolutionary martyrs' families" has become the prevailing sentiment in the city.

Break the mindset of "no external wealth, no prosperity," establish the concept of "working hard to get rich through science," and transform the means of making money from "seeking profit at the expense of morality" to "obeying the law and regulations." Addressing the issue of some young people aiming to get rich through external wealth and quick profits, and even engaging in speculation, tax evasion, and other illegal activities, the city's People's Armed Forces Department, Commerce, Taxation, and Judicial departments have jointly formed three "Law-abiding Wealth Creation Dialogue Groups." These groups travel to various towns and villages to answer related questions and raise young people's awareness of obeying the law and regulations in a commodity economy. The city has held over 160 "Science and Technology Wealth Creation Study Classes" on breeding, planting, and agricultural machinery repair, training more than 5,000 science and technology wealth creation cadres. The city has also held multiple rural youth wealth creation experience exchange meetings and on-site meetings, promoting and commending advanced examples of law-abiding operations, leading the masses to get rich together, and remembering the country even after becoming wealthy. This has formed a trend among urban and rural youth that "seeking illicit gains is shameful, and getting rich through proper means is honorable."

Break the mindset of pursuing extravagance and ostentation, establish the concept of hard work and entrepreneurship, and transform the spiritual state from pursuing enjoyment to making more contributions. Today, "not comparing clothes and food but comparing contributions, not comparing wealth but comparing spirit" has become the goal pursued by youth across the city.

    开展“三破三立三转变”活动　大兴社会主义新风尚
    莱芜市对青年加强“四有”教育
    本报讯　今年以来，山东省莱芜市在全市城乡青年中广泛开展的“三破三立三转变”活动，成为对青年进行“四有”教育的一种有效形式。
    破“80年代各人顾各人”的思想，立“助人为乐”的观念，在人际关系上把“各顾各”变成“人帮人”。针对有的农村军烈属种地困难无人帮、社会上明知是好事无人做的情况，莱芜市在青年中大张旗鼓地开展“社会主义初级阶段要不要提倡共产主义思想”和“80年代雷锋精神要不要继续发扬”为题的大讨论，引导大家自我教育。全市成立了“学雷锋小组”、“送温暖小组”、“义务帮工队”9900多个，今年前9个月中就涌现出义务赡养孤寡老人、帮贫困户修房盖屋、为军烈属包种土地等好事1.3万余件。“人帮人，户帮户，大家都帮军烈属”成为全市风气。
    破“人无外财不富”的思想，立“勤劳脱贫、科学致富”观念，在生财之道上把“见利忘义”转变为“守法遵纪”。针对有的青年人想靠发外财、捞外快致富，甚至经营中投机倒把、偷税漏税等现象，市人武部、工商、税务、司法等部门联合组成3个“守法致富对话小组”，巡回各乡（镇）、村解答有关问题，提高青年人在商品经济中遵纪守法的自觉性。全市举办养殖、种植、农机修理等各类“科技致富学习班”160多个，培训5000余名科技致富骨干。还多次召开农村青年勤劳致富经验交流会、现场会，宣扬和表彰守法经营、带领群众共同致富、富裕不忘国家的先进典型，使“捞不义之财可耻，靠正道致富光荣”在城乡青年中形成风尚。
    破讲排场比阔气的思想，立艰苦创业观念，在精神状态上把贪图享乐转变为多做贡献。如今，“不比吃穿比贡献，不比阔气比志气”已成为全市青年追求的目标。（王志耘　蒋永武）
