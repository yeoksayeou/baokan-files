Poland is a country with a long history and rich cultural traditions. Vividly portraying the colorful lives of the Polish people has always been the persistent pursuit of Polish artists. As early as the mid-19th century, the famous Polish poet Stefan Witwicki wrote to Chopin, then in Vienna, from Warsaw: “As a Polish national composer, you will open up an incredibly vast field for your genius, where you will achieve eternal glory. Always remember: national character, national character, and above all, national character….” Polish culture and art stand out in the world with their distinct national style and character. Dances like the Mazurka and the Kujawiak, presented before our eyes, depict the industrious and brave, free and happy lives of the West Slavic, Ukrainian, and Belarusian peoples living along the Vistula and Oder rivers through different angles, rich colors, and lively rhythms. It is like a vivid and colorful Polish folk painting. The mountain dance, on the other hand, draws from the folk dances of the Alps, lively and joyful, full of passion, reflecting the humor and rugged spirit of the mountain people, like eagles soaring over the cliffs.

From these scenes filled with rich national flavors, we not only appreciate the colorful life scenes of the Polish people but also deeply feel the national spirit and indomitable will of the Polish people. The anonymous knight's song "Mother of God" from the 13th century is a battle song that has inspired and encouraged knights to bravely go to war for centuries. Due to the national passion and fearless spirit in the lyrics, this ancient song has gained eternal life, and even today, it still feels like there is a deep inner strength hidden in the majestic emotions. The song cycle "Singing of Independent and Free Poland" uses a stern and profound tone to narrate Poland's history from being partitioned to gaining independence after World War I. The songs reveal the tragic inner world of soldiers determined to share the fate of their motherland when expressing the national will of freedom. The traditional technique of alternating solo and chorus in this song cycle creates a broad and resonant effect, evoking a psychological resonance among the people. Particularly moving is the song "The Song of the Women of Warsaw," which directly embodies the heroic struggle of the Polish people. The times are difficult, but in the clear and poetic melody, there is a glimpse of people's confidence and hope. The "Polonaise," originally a victory dance for returning warriors, elevates the heroic character and martial spirit of ancient Polish warriors with its solemn and elegant dance movements and the rhythm of marching in formation. At the end of the dance, the scene of people celebrating the heroic deeds of the warriors and singing songs of victory is particularly magnificent.

The Central Art Troupe of the Polish People's Army was born in the anti-fascist struggle and has gone through 46 years. Patriotism and revolutionary heroism have always been their main themes. The solo and chorus "Oka River" is a song from the Polish army during World War II, with a powerful and magnificent rhythm and bright melody, exuding the spirit of the Polish people. When we hear "The March of the First Army," we naturally think of soldiers charging into battle, the clash of swords and guns, and feel a magnificent scene of galloping horses. The dance "Warsaw Concert" combines national dance and modern dance, with solo, duo, and group dances intertwining, showcasing the unyielding national spirit of the people in the grand scene and diverse group dances. The song and dance "Let All the Bells Ring" pushes the entire performance to a climax. This song celebrating the great victory over fascism has a warm and intimate melody, as if comforting the hearts of people wounded by war with sweet tunes, followed by a bright and clear melody, occasionally flashing the joyful rhythm of the dance, letting people feel the joy of the Polish people at the end of the war and their longing for peaceful life.

　　在绚丽的色彩中飞翔
　　——波兰人民军中央艺术团演出随感
　　西南
    波兰是一个有着悠久历史和文化传统的国家。生动地表现波兰人民绚丽多采的生活，一直是波兰艺术家们的执著追求。早在19世纪中叶，波兰著名诗人斯特凡·维特维茨基从华沙给当时在维也纳的肖邦写信：“作为一个波兰民族作曲家，你将为自己的天才开辟无比广阔的活动天地，在这个天地里为自己取得永垂不朽的光荣吧。你要经常记着：民族性，民族性，最后还是民族性……。”波兰文化艺术正是以鲜明的民族气派和民族风格立于世界之林。像展现在我们眼前的玛祖尔舞、库雅维亚克舞，通过不同的侧面、丰富的色彩和欢快的节奏，描绘了生活在维斯瓦河、奥德河沿岸的西斯拉夫族、乌克兰族和白俄罗斯族人民勤劳勇敢、自由幸福的情景，好像一幅色泽华丽、光彩夺目的波兰民族风情画。而山民舞则吸取了阿尔卑斯山区民间舞蹈语汇，活泼欢快，热情沸腾，表现了山地人民幽默的情趣和粗犷的胸怀，有如山崖上展翅奋飞的雄鹰。
    从这一幕幕充满了浓郁的民族风情的舞影乐彩之中，我们不仅领略了波兰人民五彩缤纷的生活图景，而且深深地感受到了波兰人民的民族气节和不屈的精神。13世纪无名氏作的波兰最早的骑士歌曲《圣母》，是一支多少世纪以来激励和鼓舞骑士们勇敢出征的战歌。由于歌词中渲腾的民族热情和无所畏惧精神的青春活力，使这支古老的歌获得了不朽的生命，至今听来仍感到在雄壮的情感中隐含着深沉内在的力量。《歌唱独立与自由的波兰》这组歌曲，以严峻而深厚的音调，叙述了波兰从被瓜分到第一次世界大战以后直至获得独立壮烈的历史。歌曲在表现波兰民族的自由意志时，揭示了战士决心与祖国共命运的悲壮的内心世界。合唱与独唱遥相呼应的传统手法，在这组歌曲中造成时代辽阔、大地回响的写意效果，又有能引起一代人共鸣的心理效果。尤其是直接体现波兰人民英勇战斗的《华沙女人之歌》更为感人。岁月是艰难的，但是在明朗而富有诗意的音调中，却闪现了人们的信心和希望。曾作为出征武士的凯旋舞的《波罗乃兹舞》，以庄严典雅的舞姿和滑步行进的队列节奏，升华了波兰古代武士的英雄性格与尚武精神，在舞蹈的结束出现了人们为勇士们的赫赫战功而欢欣鼓舞、高唱凯歌的情景，风格尤为豪放。
    波兰人民军中央艺术团是在反法西斯的战斗中诞生的艺术团体，至今已走过了46年的历程。爱国主义和革命英雄主义始终是他们的主旋律。独唱、合唱《奥卡河》是一支产生于第二次世界大战时的波兰军队的歌曲，那雄浑豪壮的节奏和辉煌明亮的音调，洋溢出波兰人民的气概。当我们听到
  《第一军团进行曲》时，似乎很自然就会联想起战士们跃马上阵、刀枪撞击的音响，并可以感受到这是一幅纵马飞驰的壮丽图景。舞蹈《华沙音乐会》把民族舞和现代舞结合起来，独舞、双人舞和集体舞交织进行，在宏大的场面和多姿的群舞中，负伤的青年军人与一位少女在波兰沦陷后坚贞不屈的民族精神跃然而出。歌舞
  《让所有的银钟都响起》把整个演出推向高潮。这首庆祝反法西斯伟大胜利的歌曲，音调温馨亲切，似以甜美的旋律慰藉人们饱经战争创伤的心灵，接着变为明快嘹亮的音调，还不时闪现出舞曲的欢快节奏，让人们感受到波兰人民对战争结束的欢欣和对和平生活的向往。（附图片）
