Even during the recess, it has become relatively easy and convenient for the representatives of the People's Congress at various levels in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to reflect on social realities and the voices of the people, and to supervise and promote government work. The Standing Committee of the Regional People's Congress has opened up multiple channels for representatives to participate in politics, which is beneficial for the representatives to fulfill their duties and for the people's government to accept supervision from the representatives and improve their work.

The Standing Committee of the Guangxi Regional People's Congress, which has been in operation for exactly 10 years, has made beneficial explorations to seek effective communication between the representatives of the People's Congress and the people's government. During the sessions of the People's Congress, the Standing Committee of the Regional People's Congress has evolved from the initial general discussions a few years ago to the recent two activities that have been highly praised by the representatives: the thematic dialogue between the leaders of the Autonomous Region Government and the representatives of the People's Congress, and the on-site office work of the leaders of the government and its departments at the representatives' residences. During the recess, the Standing Committee of the Regional People's Congress has also changed its inspection methods from the initial general investigations and inspections within the region to the recent thematic cross-regional investigations and inspections. Starting from this term, the Standing Committee of the Regional People's Congress also regularly sends "Special Form for Criticism and Suggestions by Representatives of the People's Congress" to the national and regional representatives of the People's Congress in Guangxi. The representatives of the People's Congress can propose criticisms and suggestions based on the reflections from the masses and their own understanding of the situation and opinions, which are then forwarded by the Standing Committee of the Regional People's Congress to the relevant government departments at various levels for handling, and the handling results are then returned to the representatives of the People's Congress.

After the Beijing crackdown, the representatives of the People's Congress in Guangxi have gained a new channel for participating in politics: the situation briefing meeting by the Autonomous Region People's Government to the representatives of the People's Congress. Last week, Vice Chairman Li Zhenxuan of the Regional Government briefed the dozens of national and Guangxi representatives of the People's Congress in Nanning on the government's major work in recent periods and the hot issues of general concern in society, and answered the representatives' inquiries. The representatives of the People's Congress made frank suggestions and criticisms on the government's work based on the briefing.

　　广西采取切实措施促进政府工作
　　广辟人大代表参政渠道
    本报南宁电　记者郑盛丰报道：即使是在闭会期间，广西壮族自治区各级人大代表反映社会实情和人民呼声，监督和促进政府工作，也是较为容易而方便的事情了。区人大常委会为代表们开辟了多种参政议政的渠道，既有利于人大代表履行职责，又有利于人民政府接受人大代表监督，改进工作。
    产生至今正好10个年头的广西区人大常委会，为寻求人大代表与人民政府之间的有效沟通作了有益的探索。召开人代会时，区人大常委会由最初几年的泛泛听会讨论，到近几年增加的深受代表称道的两项活动：自治区政府负责人与人大代表的专题对话会和政府及其部门负责人到代表驻地现场办公。闭会期间的代表视察方法，区人大常委会也由起初只限于本地区的一般性调查视察，变为近年的专题性跨地区调查视察。从这一届起，区人大常委会又定期给在广西的全国人大代表和自治区人大代表，寄发“人大代表批评建议专用表”。人大代表可根据群众反映和自己了解的情况与意见，提出批评建议，由区人大常委会转各级政府及有关部门处理，然后把处理结果函复人大代表。
    北京平暴之后，广西的人大代表又获得了一种新的参政议政渠道：自治区人民政府向人大代表的情况通报会。上周，区政府副主席李振潜，就政府近期的主要工作和目前社会普遍关心的热点问题，向在南宁的数十位全国和广西人大代表及时通报，并回答了人大代表的咨询。人大代表根据通报对政府工作提出了坦诚的建议与批评。
