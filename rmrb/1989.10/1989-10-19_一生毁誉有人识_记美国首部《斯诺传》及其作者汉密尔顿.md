A Life of Praise and Criticism Recognized by Some
— A Record of the First American Biography of Edgar Snow and Its Author John Maxwell Hamilton

By People's Daily reporter Cang Lide

Seventeen years after the passing of Mr. Edgar Snow, the first biography of Snow written by an American was published in the United States. Recently, the reporter met with the author, John Maxwell Hamilton, in Washington.

Hamilton is in his early 40s, of medium build, slightly balding, and has the appearance of a scholar. He is a Ph.D. in the humanities from George Washington University. In his early years, he worked as a reporter for the *Milwaukee Journal* and the *Christian Science Monitor*. Later, he worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the World Bank. He has visited many places in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and has visited China several times. He told the reporter that he had admired Snow's achievements since his youth. The death of Snow in the early 1970s and the subsequent normalization of U.S.-China relations prompted him to decide to write a biography of this pioneer who laid the bridge for mutual understanding between the U.S. and China, thereby promoting American studies on Snow. Since then, he has read almost all of Snow's works and related commentaries, interviewed many of Snow's friends and acquaintances from his lifetime, including Snow's friends in China, Huang Hua, Louis Aylinger, Ma Haide, and Epstein, and obtained a large amount of letters and other firsthand materials. After years of effort, he finally completed this 300-page magnum opus last year, which was published by Indiana University Press.

The book *Edgar Snow: A Biography* is divided into 10 chapters, providing a detailed account of Snow's extraordinary experiences from his childhood to his final rest in Switzerland. The main theme of this book is the relationship between Snow's personal fate and China, the Chinese Revolution, and U.S.-China exchanges. According to the author, the United States has never truly understood China. Most Americans, especially those in power, judge China and its revolution based on their own values or preferences. Therefore, Snow's life is a tragicomedy filled with both honor and disgrace.

Before Snow broke through the Nationalist blockade and arrived in Yan'an in 1936, the United States, and indeed the entire West, knew very little about the Chinese Communists. At that time, newspapers were filled with rumors and malicious propaganda such as "Mao Zedong is dead" and "the Red Army is a band of bandits." After the publication of *Red Star Over China* (translated into Chinese as *Journey to the West*), the world was astonished, and Snow was highly praised in the United States, becoming a famous figure alongside the American journalist John Reed, who wrote about the Russian October Revolution. An important reason for this was that Americans believed that the Chinese Communist leaders, led by Mao Zedong, were "Lincoln-like" "land democracy reformers." As for the nature and goals of the Chinese Communist Party as described by Snow, they turned a blind eye. Therefore, when McCarthyism and the "Red Scare" were rampant in the United States in the 1950s, and China was seen as a "monster," and when the U.S. government launched the Korean War and the Vietnam War to contain the supposed "Chinese Communist conquest of Asia," Snow inevitably became a victim of the U.S. government's anti-communist policies and a target of media slander and attacks, and was also monitored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Unable to bear the political persecution, Snow had to leave his homeland and live in Switzerland. As Hamilton wrote in the book, "The tragedy is not that Snow misled Americans, but that they did not listen to him."

In the 1940s, Snow published an average of 10 reports a year in the *Saturday Evening Post* alone; but throughout the 1950s, this country that boasts of "freedom of the press" published only three or four of his articles. In the early 1960s, Snow, as the first American journalist to visit New China, interviewed Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and learned about the conditions they proposed for restoring Sino-American relations. Even such important information could not be found in a single American publication for a complete report. At that time, the United States had no intention of changing its hostile policy towards China and preferred to believe lies such as "the Chinese are eating their own children" and "Mao will not live long." Ironically, Nixon's historic visit to China was to rebuild U.S.-China relations according to the conditions reported by Snow at that time. Shortly before his death, Snow received a short note from Nixon before his departure from Washington: "Your distinguished career has received such widespread respect and praise." Previously, American news media had rushed to invite Snow to express his "authoritative" views on U.S.-China relations. By this time, Snow's reputation in the United States had made a 180-degree turn.

Sensing that the United States was about to launch another "China craze," Snow, on his deathbed, wrote in the final chapter of his last book, *The Long Revolution*, "The danger lies in the possibility that Americans may imagine that the Chinese are abandoning communism and Mao's worldview and becoming lovable land democrats. A more realistic world is indeed before us. But if the widespread illusion is that this world will contain a sweet mixture of various ideologies, or the end of China's belief in revolutionary methods, then when the illusion is shattered, it will only deepen the gap..." Looking back at the past and at the recent twists and turns in U.S. policy towards China, Snow's warning is undoubtedly still very relevant.

When discussing the main theme of the book, Hamilton told the reporter that he hopes through *Edgar Snow: A Biography* to help Americans better understand China and the world as they are, and only in this way can they deal with people from other countries. He said, "We do not necessarily have to agree with others' views, but we must respect them; the United States cannot treat other countries with a self-righteous attitude."

### 一生毁誉有人识——记美国首部《斯诺传》及其作者汉密尔顿

    一生毁誉有人识
    ——记美国首部《斯诺传》及其作者汉密尔顿
    本报记者　仓立德
    在艾德加·斯诺先生去世17年之后，由美国人撰写的第一部斯诺传记在美国出版。不久前，记者在华盛顿见到了作者约翰·马克斯维尔·汉密尔顿。
    汉密尔顿40出头，中等身材，略微谢顶，一副学者模样。他是乔治·华盛顿大学文科博士，早年为《密尔沃基日报》、《基督教科学箴言报》当记者，后为美国国际开发署、国会众议院外委会及世界银行工作，到过亚、非、拉许多地方，并数度访问中国。他对记者说，早在年轻时他便景仰斯诺的业绩。七十年代初斯诺的逝世及随之而来的美中关系正常化，促使他下决心为这位铺设美中相互理解桥梁的先驱立传，以此推动美国对斯诺的研究。此后，他几乎阅读了所有斯诺的作品及有关评论，采访了许多斯诺生前的亲朋故旧，包括斯诺在中国的好友黄华、路易·艾黎、马海德、艾泼斯坦等，获得大量书信及其他一手资料，穷十几年之功终于在去年完成了这部长达300页的力作，由印第安那大学出版社付梓。
    《斯诺传》全书共分10章，翔实地展现了斯诺从孩提时代直至长眠瑞士的非凡经历。此书的主线是斯诺的个人命运与中国、中国革命及美中交往的关系。按照作者的观点，美国从未真正了解中国。大部分美国人，尤其是当权者，只凭自己的价值观念或偏好来衡量中国及其革命，因此，斯诺的一生是一部饱经荣辱褒贬的悲喜剧。
    在斯诺1936年冲破国民党封锁抵达延安之前，美国乃至整个西方对中国共产党人知之甚少。当时报刊上弥漫着“毛泽东已死”、“红军是土匪”等谣言和恶意宣传。《红星照耀中国》（即中译《西行漫记》）出版后，世界为之一惊，斯诺也因此在美国被推崇备至，成为同描写俄国十月革命的美国记者约翰·里德齐名的著名人物。一个重要原因是，美国人认为以毛泽东为首的中国共产党领袖们是“林肯式”的“土地民主改革家”，至于斯诺叙述的中国共产党的性质及其目标，他们却视而不见。因此，当五十年代以麦卡锡主义为代表的反共歇斯底里及“红色恐慌”在美国甚嚣尘上、中国被视为“洪水猛兽”时，当美国政府先后发动侵朝战争、越南战争以遏制所谓“中国共产主义征服亚洲”时，斯诺便无可避免地成为美国政府反共政策的受害者和报刊诽谤攻击的对象，并受到联邦调查局的监视。不堪忍受种种政治迫害的斯诺不得不辞别故国，客居瑞士。诚如汉密尔顿在书中所言，“悲剧并非斯诺误导了美国人，而是他们不听他的”。
    在四十年代，斯诺平均每年仅在《星期六晚邮报》一家报纸上便发表10篇报道；但在整个50年代，这个标榜“新闻自由”的国家只刊登过他的三四篇文章。在六十年代初，斯诺作为第一位访问新中国的美国记者，采访了毛泽东、周恩来等中国领导人并获悉他们提出的恢复中美邦交的条件，甚至这样重要的信息也无法在美国找到一家刊物给予完整报道。当时美国根本无意改变其敌视中国的政策，宁肯相信什么“中国人正在吃自己的孩子”、“毛活不了几天”之类的谎言。具有讽刺意味的是，尼克松总统历史性的中国之行，正是按照斯诺当年所报道的条件重建美中关系。不久于人世的斯诺接到尼克松行前发自华盛顿的一封短笺：“你的杰出生涯受到了如此广泛的尊敬和赞扬。”此前，美国新闻媒介争先恐后地邀请斯诺发表有关美中关系的“权威性”言论。至此，斯诺在美国的声誉又来个180度的大转弯。
    预感到美国又将掀起一场“中国热”，病榻中的斯诺在其最后一部著作《漫长的革命》结尾处写道，“危险在于美国人可能幻想中国人正在放弃共产主义以及毛的世界观，变成可爱的土地民主派。一个更为现实的世界的确已在眼前。但如果普遍的幻觉是这个世界将包含各种意识形态的甜密混合，抑或是中国对革命方式的信念的终结，那么在幻觉破灭到来时只能加剧这个鸿沟的深度……”回顾往昔，再看看最近美国对华政策中的曲折，斯诺的这番忠告无疑仍颇具现实意义。
    在谈到此书的主旨时，汉密尔顿对记者说，他希望通过
  《斯诺传》使美国更好地按照事物的本来面目来认识中国以至整个世界，唯其如此才能同别国人民打交道。他说，我们不一定同意别人的观点，但必须尊重他们；美国不能以自以为是的态度来对待其他国家。
