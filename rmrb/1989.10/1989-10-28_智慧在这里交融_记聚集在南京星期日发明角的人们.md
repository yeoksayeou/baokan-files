Every last Sunday of the month is the activity day for the Sunday Invention Corner in Nanjing. They gather at the Nanjing Jinling Library, exchanging ideas on inventions, seeking knowledge complementarity, and sharing the joy of success.

Inventions Born from Life

The Sunday Invention Corner in Nanjing has been established for over two years, with 128 members, 84 invention patents, and 236 invention and innovation achievements. Among them, there are several inventions that have gained international recognition. Engineer Han Yushan's high-rise rescue device won the gold medal at the 14th Geneva International Invention Expo; Engineer Lü Meiqing's self-climbing bicycle won the World Strange Invention Award from Tokyo Television in Japan; and middle school teacher Gu Bangjie's refrigerator electric deodorizer and sterilizer won the national Star Science and Technology Silver Award.

Members of the Invention Corner come from various industries, and their invention achievements mostly stem from problems encountered in daily life or work, making it easy to transition from prototypes to products, benefiting the people.

For example, the spittoon lifting cover has a movable claw attached to the lid, allowing the spittoon filled with waste to be lifted and carried away, making it convenient and hygienic; the three-wheeled stair-climbing cart helps residents in multi-story buildings carry rice and gas cylinders without the need to carry them on their backs; the reading and writing gloves have drawstrings added to the thumb and index finger, allowing for both reading, writing, and warmth...

The Realm of Effortless Invention

Zhang Ruihong's home is a world of inventions! The table is filled with his invention results, and the walls are adorned with them. As he talks, he casually picks up an invention to demonstrate: the tea canister can dispense a fixed amount of tea multiple times; pulling a cigarette from the cigarette pack produces a pleasant musical sound... He has over 100 inventions, and out of the 5 invention patents he has obtained, 4 have been licensed to factories for production. The reading and writing gloves appeared in a children's store and sold over 300 pairs on the first day.

"Is inventing difficult?" I asked. "It's difficult, but it's not," he replied. "Difficult because at the beginning, you haven't found the knack. It's not difficult because once you cultivate the habit of observing and thinking, you'll find there's always something to work on."

Indeed, Zhang Ruihong has now reached a stage where he can effortlessly invent. Seeing students on the street with bulky school bags, he invented a health school bag for students that automatically displays when the bag exceeds the specified weight. Food stored in the refrigerator for too long can also spoil, so he came up with the refrigerator storage display, which uses magnets to stick to the refrigerator door, clearly showing the types and dates of items stored in the refrigerator.

These two inventions have already been licensed and put into production.

Zhang Ruihong is 32 years old and works as a miller in a factory. He uses the milling process to machine parts, making them form in one go, which not only improves the precision but also increases the work efficiency by more than tenfold.

Last year, at the Nanjing Youth Science and Technology Festival, the factory had 6 inventions listed, and he alone accounted for 4 of them.

One Idea Becomes Two

The life of an inventor is not entirely about inventions, but it is always connected to inventions. Zhou Jianhui, who holds two invention patents, jokingly calls himself "overly energetic." Seeing police correcting drivers on the road, he also goes to watch and then offers several suggestions, such as holding traffic safety competitions and selecting star drivers, making the traffic police nod in agreement and asking this expert to write down the suggestions and send them to the bureau. And he did. "As long as you break away from conventional thinking, you'll come up with many new ideas." Once, a few people from the Invention Corner went to a factory on business and saw the factory director worried about the piles of scrap iron. After a few heads got together, they came up with more than 20 uses in an instant. The factory director kept praising them and sent people to screen and implement the ideas, turning waste into treasure.

"You have an apple, and I have an apple; after exchanging, we still have one apple each. You have an idea, and I have an idea; after exchanging, we have two ideas." Members of the Invention Corner place great importance on exchanging invention ideas in their daily lives, seeing things from different perspectives, engaging in lively debates, and conducting knowledge hybridization and discipline fusion.

Zhou Jianhui told the reporter that as a shrewd entrepreneur, one should not only focus on the market but also on inventions, using new products to open up the market. A member of the Invention Corner invented a steel fire door, which made a factory in dire straits suddenly profit by more than 800,000 yuan. What makes the members of the Invention Corner happy is that a few factory directors, after tasting the sweetness of producing invention products, actively contact them, learn about their invention dynamics, and seek new inventions that can be put into production.

　　智慧在这里交融
　　——记聚集在南京星期日发明角的人们
　　本报记者　龚永泉
    每个月的最后一个星期日，是南京星期日发明角的活动日。他们聚会在南京金陵图书馆，交流发明的思路，寻求知识的互补，分享成功的喜悦。
  来自生活的成果
    南京星期日发明角成立两年多来，已有成员128人，拥有发明专利84项，发明与革新成果236项，其中不乏饮誉中外的发明成果。工程师韩玉山发明的高楼救生器获第14届日内瓦世界发明金奖；工程师吕美琪发明的自行爬杆车，获日本东京电视台世界奇特发明奖；中学教师顾邦杰发明的冰箱电动除臭杀菌器获全国星火科技银奖。
    发明角的成员来自各行各业，发明成果大多出自生活或工作中的难题，容易从样品变成产品，造福于民。
    如痰盂拎提盖，盖上附有活动爪，可以像拎菜篮子一样将盛满污物的痰盂拎走，方便卫生；由3个轮子组成的爬楼车，使住单元楼居民买米换煤气免去了背扛之苦；阅读书写手套是在拇指和食指部位加上拉练，可以兼顾阅读写字与保暖……
    左右逢源的发明境界
    发明角成员张锐鸿的家简直是发明的世界！桌上摆的，墙上挂的，都是他的发明成果，谈着谈着，他就信手拿起一件发明给你演示一番：茶叶筒可以多次倒出定量的茶叶；从烟盒里抽出香烟会发出悦耳的音乐声……他已拥有100多项发明，所获5项发明专利中已有4项转让厂家投入生产。阅读书写手套在儿童商店露面，当日销售量便达300多双。
      “搞发明难不难？”我问。“说难又不难。”他答，“难，是指刚开始时而言，因为没摸着门道。不难，是指一旦养成了勤于观察乐于动脑的习惯，就会感到有搞不完的东西。”
    是的，张锐鸿现在已进入了触类旁通左右逢源的境界。看到路上小学生背的书包鼓鼓囊囊，他发明了小学生保健书包，当书包超过规定重量时，就会自动显示。食品在冰箱里存放时间长了也会变质，他就琢磨出了冰箱存物显示器，用磁铁吸在冰箱门上，冰箱里存放的物品品种及日期，一目了然。
    这两件发明目前均已转让投入生产。
    张锐鸿今年32岁，是一家工厂的铣工，他采用以铣代刨的工艺加工零件，使零件一次成型，既提高了精确度，还提高了工效10多倍。
    去年，南京青年科技节上，厂里有6项发明榜上有名，他就占了4项。
    一个思想变两个思想
    发明者的生活不全都是发明，但又无不与发明相联系。拥有两项发明专利的周建辉自嘲“精力过剩”。见到马路旁警察纠正违章司机，他也要去看看，然后提出几条建议，什么开展交通安全竞赛啦，评选明星车啦，说得交通警连连点头，还要他这位行家写成书面建议寄到局里去。而他也就写了，寄了。“其实，只要突破常规去思考，就会涌出许多的新主意。”一次，发明角的几个人到一家工厂办事，见到厂长正为堆积如山的铁皮下脚料发愁，几个脑袋凑在一起合计之后，一下子提出了20多种用途，厂长连连称好，派人去筛选实施，变废为宝。
      “你有一个苹果，我有一个苹果，交换了还是一个苹果；你有一个思想，我有一个思想，交换了就有两个思想。”发明角的成员平日十分重视相互交流发明的思路，见仁见智，唇枪舌剑，进行知识的杂交，学科的化合。
    周建辉告诉记者，作为一个精明的企业家，不仅要围着市场转，还应围着发明转，用新产品去开拓市场。发明角一成员发明了钢质防火门，就使一个陷入困境的校办工厂一下子赢利80多万元。使发明角成员感到欣慰的是，有几位厂长通过尝到接产发明产品的甜头，主动同他们联系，了解他们的发明动态，寻求可以投产的新发明。
