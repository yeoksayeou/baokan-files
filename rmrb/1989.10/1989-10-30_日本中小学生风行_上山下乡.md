A survey of over a thousand middle school students in cities like Tokyo and Osaka in Japan has revealed that half of today's urban middle school students have never seen a herd of cows or sheep with their own eyes. One quarter have never cooked a meal or prepared a dish, one third have never walked continuously for more than five kilometers, and many children have never left the city they live in...

Thus, with the support of some experts and parents, many middle schools in Japan have recently implemented a "going to the mountains and countryside" program. Many city children have taken off their fancy clothes and fashionable skirts, swapped them for sturdy farm attire, and enthusiastically headed to remote villages for "study abroad." In some villages, teachers and farmers have collaborated to establish "study abroad centers." During the four-week "study abroad" period, children spend three weeks living with local families and village children, and one week at the "center" for study and activities.

The new life of "sending down to the countryside" has greatly interested the children. Every morning, they get up with the farmers, prepare their own breakfast, and then walk with the village children to the rural school. After school, they help with farm work, feed the livestock, and do some housework, just like the village children. In just three weeks, city children have built friendships with village children, developed work habits, broadened their horizons, and received a lesson in "hard work and plain living." During the week at the "study abroad center," the entire class enjoys collective life. Besides cooking and doing housework, the "center" invites experienced farmers as "guest teachers" to teach the children agricultural technology.

The extracurricular activities arranged by the "study abroad center" are also rich and varied, including performances for the villagers, joint activities with the rural school, fishing, and herding.

The one-month "study abroad life" not only taught the city children many things they couldn't learn in school or from textbooks, but also made their bodies stronger. Many parents who once had "doubts" have changed their minds and are now sending their children to the countryside to "study abroad."

　　日本中小学生风行“上山下乡”
　　唐若水
    日本对东京、大阪等城市千余名中小学生的抽样调查表明，今天的城市中小学生中竟有一半人从未亲眼见过牛群或羊群，有1／4的从未煮过饭、烧过菜，有1／3的连续步行从未超过5公里，还有不少孩子从未离开过生活的城市……
    于是，在一些专家的推动和家长们的支持下，近年来日本为数不少的中小学校推行起一种“上山下乡”计划。许多城市孩子脱下精致的时装和时髦的短裙，换上了厚实的农家服，兴致勃勃地来到边远的村寨“留学”。在一些村寨里，教师和农民合作创办了一个个“留学中心”。在四周的“留学期”中，孩子们有三周被安排在各农户与农村孩子共同生活，另一周则在“中心”参加学习和活动。
    “插队”的新生活使孩子们大感兴趣。每天早晨，他们和农民们一同起床，然后自己动手做早餐，接着跟农村孩子一起步行去农村学校上学。放学后，他们和农村孩子一样帮助干农活、喂牲口，还做一些家务。短短的三周中，城市孩子与农村孩子建立了感情，培养了劳动习惯，开阔了视野，也接受了一次“艰苦朴素”教育。在“留学中心”的另一周中，全班同学在一起愉快地过集体生活。除了自己动手做饭菜、干家务外，“中心”还邀请有经验的农民作“特邀教师”，为孩子们传授农业科技知识。
    “留学中心”安排的课余生活也十分丰富多采，其中有为农民们表演文娱节目，与农村学校联欢、钓鱼、放牧等。
    为期一月的“留学生活”不仅使城市孩子学到了不少学校里或课本上学不到的东西，而且使身体锻炼得更为健壮。不少以前曾有“疑虑”的家长也改变了态度，纷纷送孩子“上山下乡”去“留学”。
