Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, the largest special steel plate and material base in China, has established a strong political work team.

This iron and steel joint enterprise with over 60,000 employees has been paying attention to strengthening the political work team since 1984. The company's party committee selects individuals with a firm political stance, a certain level of cultural and technical proficiency, and the ability to closely connect with the masses to serve as leaders in various levels of the party organization. This group of cadres not only understands business and technology but also has a high level of political awareness. Party members are satisfied, and the masses support them. Among the 614 cadres specifically engaged in party work, 281 have a college degree or higher, accounting for 45%.

Taiyuan Steel evaluates political work titles based on strict standards and conditions throughout the company. Cadres who obtain political work titles enjoy the same treatment as those who obtain other professional and technical titles in terms of salary, bonuses, housing, and usage, which has motivated political work cadres.

Taiyuan Steel's enterprise party school, correspondence school, radio and television university, and night school all have special classes to train political work cadres. They adopt methods such as full-time, part-time study, regular rotation training, and thematic lectures to train over 14,000 party members throughout the company, ensuring that each has undergone training. They have also conducted multiple training sessions for party cadres at the section level and above.

Due to having a strong political work team, Taiyuan Steel has provided important guarantees for the vigorous development of ideological and political work, promoted the establishment of normal work order, and facilitated production development.

    按德才标准选拔  以多种形式培训
    太钢加强政工队伍建设
    本报太原讯　记者王艾生报道：我国最大的特种钢板材基地太原钢铁公司，已建立起一支坚强的政工队伍。
    这个有6万余名职工的钢铁联合企业，从1984年以来就注意加强政工队伍的建设。企业党委按德才兼备的标准，选拔政治立场坚定、具有相当文化技术水平且能密切联系群众的人，担任企业各级党组织的领导职务。这批干部既懂业务技术，又具有较高的政治觉悟，党员满意，群众拥护。在614名专门从事党务工作的干部中，具有大专以上文化程度的有281名，占45％。
    太钢按严格的标准和条件，在全公司评定政工专业职称。获得政工职称的干部，同获得其他业务技术职称的干部一样，在工资、奖金、住房以及使用上享有同等待遇，调动了政工干部的积极性。
    太钢企业党校、函大、电大、夜校，也都专设班级培训政工干部，采取脱产、半脱产学习、定期轮训、专题讲座等方式，对全公司14000多名党员已普遍轮训一次，对处级以上党员干部也多次进行培训。
    太钢由于有了一支坚强的政工队伍，既为思想政治工作的蓬勃开展提供了重要保证，又促进了正常工作秩序的建立和生产的发展。
