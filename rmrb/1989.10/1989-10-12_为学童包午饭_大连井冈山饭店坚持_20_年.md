	The Jian'gangshan Hotel in Dalian has been providing lunches for schoolchildren for 20 consecutive years, earning the title of a "second home" from parents and children alike.

	The Jian'gangshan Hotel in Dalian has 102 employees. Since 1969, it has set up a special dining room to provide lunches for schoolchildren who have nowhere to eat during the day. Over the years, the hotel's management has changed several times, and the staff has also seen several turnovers, but this service of providing lunches for children has remained unchanged. Providing lunches for children requires the use of the hotel's business space and staff, making it a task that adds trouble and does not earn much money. In recent years, their costs have increased, but the prices and quality of the meals have not changed. Children can enjoy a nutritious and delicious lunch for just a few yuan. The hotel caters to the dietary habits and nutritional needs of children, ensuring that the menu changes every week. The hotel also provides special meals for children's birthdays and for those who are ill.

	The high-quality service of the Jian'gangshan Hotel has attracted more and more children to come for lunches, with nearly 400 children doing so in the past two years.

    为学童包午饭
    大连井冈山饭店坚持20年
    据新华社大连10月11日电　（记者李小林）大连市井冈山饭店连续20年为上学的儿童包午饭，被家长和儿童称为第二个家。
    大连市井冈山饭店有职工102人，从1969年开始设立专门餐室，为一些无处吃午饭的上学儿童提供午饭。这些年，饭店领导换了几茬，职工也换了几批，但为儿童包饭这个服务项目却一直没有变。为儿童包饭，要占用饭店的营业面积和人员，是一项既添麻烦又赚不了多少钱的工作。尤其是近几年，他们的成本增加了，但饭费不涨、饭菜质量不降，儿童只要花上三五角钱，就可吃到一顿实惠可口的午餐。饭店根据儿童的饮食特点和营养需要，做到了每星期品种不重样。饭店还为包饭儿童增设了生日饭和病号饭。
    井冈山饭店的优质服务，吸引着越来越多的儿童前来包饭，近两年已达400多人。
