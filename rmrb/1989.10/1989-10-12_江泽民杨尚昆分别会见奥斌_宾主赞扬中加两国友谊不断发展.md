	Jiang Zemin and Yang Shangkun met separately with Paul Victor Obeng

	Host and guest praised the continuous development of Sino-Canadian friendship

	BEIJING, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) — Reporter Gu Yuqing — General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, met with Paul Victor Obeng, a member of the Ghanaian Provisional National Defense Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, this morning at Zhongnanhai.

	Jiang Zemin said that although our two countries are far apart, we are not strangers to each other. We have a long history of exchanges between us.

	Obeng agreed, saying that in recent years, the exchanges between our two countries' leaders have become more frequent, which is necessary. This is because such actions can shorten the geographical distance.

	Obeng congratulated the People's Republic of China on celebrating its 40th anniversary and also congratulated Comrade Jiang Zemin on his appointment as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. He believed that the new Chinese leadership headed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin would certainly carry on the cause of the older generation of Chinese revolutionary leaders, continue the past, and develop into the future.

	Obeng expressed satisfaction with the development of friendly relations between the two countries. He hoped that economic and technological cooperation between Ghana and China could make new progress.

	In addition, Obeng also briefed General Secretary Jiang on the current situation in Africa and Southern Africa.

	Jiang Zemin thanked the Ghanaian government for its understanding and support for China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He said that after suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, China's political situation is stable. While we continue to reform and open up to the outside world, we still need to learn from the advanced science and technology and management experience of capitalist countries. Of course, we must also be vigilant against capitalist infiltration. He also told the guest that although we still have some temporary difficulties, the future is bright.

	BEIJING, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) — Reporter Gu Yuqing — This afternoon, Chairman Yang Shangkun met with Paul Victor Obeng, a member of the Ghanaian Provisional National Defense Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, at the Great Hall of the People. He said that China and Ghana have a traditional friendly relationship. Ghana is one of the first African countries to establish diplomatic relations with us. The good foundation of our friendship was jointly laid by the older generation of Chinese leaders, such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, and the first President of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah. In recent years, mutual visits by the leaders of the two countries have further developed this friendly relationship.

	Chairman Yang praised the Ghanaian government and people for their achievements in revitalizing the national economy, improving people's lives, and strengthening national unity. At the same time, he highly appreciated Ghana's government's policy of active neutrality and non-alignment in foreign affairs, its opposition to hegemony, and its support for the just struggle of the Namibian people and the people of Southern Africa.

	Obeng conveyed the greetings of the Ghanaian head of state, Jerry John Rawlings, to Chairman Yang. He said that this visit has deepened our mutual understanding and created conditions for the development of cooperation in various fields in the future.

	When introducing the situation, Chairman Yang said that China's political situation is currently stable. Minister Obeng will also visit our southern regions, where he can see with his own eyes whether our country has achieved great successes in construction and whether our situation is truly stable.

	Obeng said, "I have only been in China for two days, but I deeply feel that you have already achieved great success. This shows that the path you have chosen is correct."

    本报北京10月11日讯　记者顾玉清报道：中共中央总书记江泽民今天上午在中南海会见了加纳临时全国保卫委员会委员、部长委员会主席保罗·维克托·奥斌。
    江泽民说，我们两国虽然相隔遥远，但并不陌生，我们相互间的交往已有久远的历史。
    奥斌表示赞同，他说，近几年来，我们两国领导人相互间的往来越来越频繁，这是必要的。因为这样做可以缩短地理上的距离。
    奥斌祝贺中华人民共和国欢度了40周年国庆，同时祝贺江泽民同志出任中共中央总书记。他认为，以江泽民总书记为首的中国新的领导班子一定会继承中国老一辈革命领导人的事业，继往开来，向前发展。
    奥斌对两国友好关系的发展表示满意。他希望加、中经济技术合作能有新的进展。
    此外，奥斌还向江总书记介绍了当今非洲和南部非洲的形势。
    江泽民感谢加纳政府对中国平息反革命暴乱的理解和支持。他说，平息反革命暴乱之后，中国的政局是稳定的。我们在坚持继续对外改革开放的同时，对资本主义国家的先进科学技术和管理经验还是要借鉴的。当然，我们也要警惕资本主义的渗透。他还告诉客人，我们目前虽然还有一些暂时的困难，但前途是光明的。
    本报北京10月11日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天下午，国家主席杨尚昆在人民大会堂会见加纳临时全国保卫委员会委员、部长委员会主席奥斌时说，中国、加纳有着传统的友好关系。加纳是非洲最早与我国建交的国家之一。我们两国友谊的良好基础是毛泽东、周恩来等我国老一辈领导人同加纳第一任总统恩克鲁玛共同奠定的。近年来，两国领导人的互访又使这种友好关系得到不断发展。
    杨主席赞扬加纳政府和人民在振兴民族经济、改善人民生活、加强本国人民团结等方面取得了可喜的成就。同时对加纳政府奉行积极的中立和不结盟外交政策，反对强权政治，支持纳米比亚人民和南部非洲人民正义斗争的立场给予高度评价。
    奥斌向杨主席转达了加纳国家元首杰黑·约翰·罗林斯对他的问候。他说，这次访问加深了我们相互之间的理解，并为今后发展多方面的合作创造了条件。
    杨主席向客人介绍情况时说，目前，中国的政局是稳定的。奥斌阁下还要到我国的南方去访问，可以亲眼看一看，我国建设是不是取得了巨大的成就，我国的局势是不是真正稳定。
    奥斌说，我到中国刚刚两天，深深感到你们已经取得了巨大成就。这说明你们选择的道路是正确的。
