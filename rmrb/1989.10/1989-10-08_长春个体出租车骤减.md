The cool autumn of September in Changchun has also brought a sudden decline in the business of individually owned taxis, which had been thriving for over two years. According to figures provided by the relevant authorities, the number of individually owned taxis in normal operation has decreased from nearly a thousand at the beginning of the year to just over 400 now.

At places like the railway station, bus station, and airport, rows of taxis stand idle with few passengers. One driver said, "In the past, most passengers were officials or businesspeople who needed receipts for reimbursement. Now, with the campaign for clean government and the rectification of companies, these travelers go straight to the bus station as soon as they get off the train."

Public transportation in Changchun is relatively convenient, and local residents usually do not take taxis unless they have urgent matters.

    长春个体出租车骤减
    据新华社长春10月6日电（记者辛明华）9月的长春渐凉，红火了两年多的个体出租小汽车生意也骤然冷落下来。据主管部门提供的数字，正常营运的个体出租小汽车由年初的近千辆减至目前的400多辆。
    在火车站、汽车站、机场等场所，停在那里的一排排出租小汽车很少有人问津。一个司机说：“过去坐车的人干部多，经商多，坐车要收据能报销的多。现在搞廉政建设，清理整顿公司，这些出差的人下了火车就直奔汽车站了。”
    长春市公共交通比较方便，本市居民除非有急事，一般不坐出租小汽车。
