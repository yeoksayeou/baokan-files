How will Britain deal with Nazi war criminals? This will be a topic for discussion and voting in the British Parliament after it reconvenes this October. Since the end of World War II, many European countries that suffered under Hitler's tyranny have been pursuing escaped Nazi war criminals. However, Britain has shown a cold response.

At the end of World War II, Britain and other Allied countries accepted a large number of foreign refugees. Due to the hasty screening procedures and the political needs of the West to counter the Soviet Union, some Nazi war criminals managed to infiltrate the Allied countries. At that time, the Allies effectively adopted a policy of not pursuing past crimes. In 1957, Britain had already stopped participating in international prosecutions of Nazi war crimes. After the start of the Cold War, the British government, citing the lack of an extradition treaty with the Soviet Union, had refused five times to extradite war crime suspects to the Soviet Union. In 1983, the capture of Nazi war criminal Barbie shocked the world. In recent years, the United States has established a special investigation office specifically for Nazi war criminals. Canada and Australia have also amended their laws to allow for the prosecution of war criminals. However, the British government has not made any statements and has instead referred the matter to Parliament for discussion.

As early as October 1986, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which specializes in tracking Nazi war criminals, had handed over a list of Nazi suspects in Britain to the British Home Secretary Hurd. The 1987 documentary "Crimes of War" revealed even more names. After a year of investigation, 62-year-old former British prosecutor Sir Hetlingdon and another barrister published a government investigation report in July of this year. The report stated that there are 301 suspects living in Britain who are suspected of crimes. Due to time constraints, only seven individuals were thoroughly investigated, with sufficient evidence to prosecute four of them. They will further investigate another 124 cases. Sir Hetlingdon told the press that he was astonished by the scale of the crimes and the solid evidence, "If no action is taken, the United Kingdom will become a haven for war criminals, and its reputation will be tarnished."

However, to prosecute individuals who have committed crimes in other countries but have been naturalized in Britain, the UK must first amend its laws. Britain has never prosecuted Nazi suspects within its borders. Sir Hetlingdon said that if Parliament can quickly change the laws this year to allow for prosecutions, the earliest trials would not begin until the second half of next year.

However, some influential figures in the political arena have already hinted that there will be no prosecutions. Some say that these are elderly individuals who pose no threat to society, and there is no need to settle old scores from decades ago. Others say that the witnesses are also old, and their memories may be faulty, and so on. Therefore, whether Britain will prosecute Nazi war criminals will depend on the outcome of the parliamentary debate.

    英国将如何对待纳粹战犯

    英国将如何对待纳粹战犯？这将是今年10月英国议会复会后要讨论和表决的问题。二次世界大战以来，饱受希特勒蹂躏之苦的许多欧洲国家一直在追查漏网的纳粹战犯，但是英国却反应冷漠。
    二次大战结束之初，英国以及盟国接受了大批外国难民。由于审查手续草率、也由于当时西方对付苏联的政治需要，一些纳粹战犯混入了盟国。当时，盟国对追捕纳粹战犯实际上采取不究已往的政策。1957年英国已停止参加对纳粹战争罪行的国际诉讼。冷战开始后，英国政府以未缔结英苏引渡条约为由，曾5次拒绝了苏联引渡战争嫌疑罪犯的要求。1983年纳粹分子巴比被捉拿归案一事轰动了全世界。美国近年也为纳粹战犯专门设立了个特别调查办公室。加拿大和澳大利亚近年也修改了法律，允许对战犯起诉。对此英国政府却没有表态，而是交议会去讨论。
    早在1986年10月，专门从事追查纳粹战犯的西蒙·魏森撒尔中心曾经将一份在英国的纳粹嫌疑犯名单交给英国内政大臣赫德。1987年放映的纪录片《战争的罪恶》里，则公布了更多的名字。62岁的英国前检察官海特灵顿爵士和另外一名大律师经过一年调查，于今年7月发表了政府调查报告。报告称，住在英国涉嫌被指控的有301人，限于时间，只详细调查了7个人，有足够证据可以起诉的有4名，他们还将进一步追查另外124起案件。海特灵顿爵士对报界说，他对“罪行的规模和证据的确凿诧异不止”，“如果不采取行动，联合王国将成为战犯避难所，名声将被玷污。”
    但是，英国要审讯在他国犯有罪行但已归化英国的人得先更改英国法律。英国还从来未曾在国内审讯过纳粹嫌疑犯。海特灵顿爵士说，如果今年议会能很快改变法律，允许审讯，那末最早的审讯也要到明年下半年才举行。
    不过，政界一些有影响的人士已放出不会审讯的空气了。有人说，这些都是些年迈体衰、对社会已经无害的人，不要去算几十年前的老账了。还有人说，证人年纪也大了，记忆可能会有差错，等等。所以，英国会不会审讯纳粹战犯，还要看议会辩论的结果。
