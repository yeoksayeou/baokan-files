The "national team" is the backbone of the socialist economy—on the importance of revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises

One of the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee is to continue to improve the rectification and adjustment, adhere to the reform and opening up, and promote the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the economy. In his speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin pointed out: "State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are the mainstay of China's modernization, and the main source of state revenue. Fully leveraging their leading role is of special importance to China's economic development."

However, currently, large and medium-sized enterprises face many difficulties in production and operation, seriously affecting their role as the backbone of the national economy. It is imperative to recognize the importance of revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises and to actively revitalize them.

In China, there are 10,676 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, accounting for only 2% of the total number of industrial enterprises with independent accounting nationwide. However, they own 64% of the fixed assets of industrial enterprises nationwide, and the taxes and profits they pay account for approximately 68% of the total taxes and profits paid by industrial enterprises nationwide, making them the "treasury" of the state. They produce many "upstream products," with a wide variety of goods, large quantities, comprehensive grades, and high quality. They are the main suppliers of effective domestic market supply and the "national team" participating in international market competition. State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are the basic force of China's modern industry, the hard-earned savings of the Chinese people over the years, and the efforts of enterprise employees. They concentrate the most advanced technology and equipment in various industries in China and have the most outstanding scientific and technological talents and workforce in various fields. To do a good job in economic work, we must first revitalize state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Currently, this has become a key to alleviating fiscal difficulties and supply-demand contradictions and preventing economic downturns. In the long term, it relates to whether we can achieve the strategic goal of realizing "moderate prosperity" by the end of this century and entering the ranks of moderately developed countries by the 1950s of the 21st century.

As early as the decision on economic system reform adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee, it was clearly pointed out: "Socialism with Chinese characteristics should first be a socialism with vigorous enterprises." "Enhancing the vitality of enterprises, especially the vitality of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, is the core of the overall economic system reform with cities as the key." In recent years, following this guiding principle, efforts have been made in enterprise reform, achieving some results, especially the widespread promotion and gradual improvement of the contract responsibility system, which has effectively mobilized the enthusiasm of enterprises and employees. However, judging by the standard of enterprises being able to operate independently, bear profits and losses, self-improve, self-develop, and self-constrain, the number of revitalized large and medium-sized enterprises is not large. Generally speaking, about 25% are relatively active, 50% are average, and 25% have poor vitality. The emergence of this situation is related to the fact that, for a period of time, specific work did not pay enough attention to revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises, specific measures were not implemented, and revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises was not truly placed in a central position.

China's economy is a socialist economy with public ownership as the mainstay, and large and medium-sized enterprises are the main embodiment of socialist public ownership. Whether large and medium-sized enterprises are doing well or not, and whether they are active or not, is actually a big issue related to whether the superiority of the socialist system can be fully exerted and demonstrated. Those advocating bourgeois liberalization, using the situation of insufficient vitality of large and medium-sized enterprises and public ownership enterprises under the old system as an excuse, advocate the abolition of public ownership, which is of course something we cannot agree with. We must, through deepening reform, and from a macro perspective, create conditions to fully exert the superiority of public ownership that large and medium-sized enterprises originally possess, which will make the superiority of the socialist system more convincing and recognized by everyone. Doing so is also a manifestation of the unity of the four cardinal principles and the two basic points of reform and opening up.

Relying on the working class wholeheartedly is a consistent guiding ideology of our Party. Large and medium-sized enterprises are where industrial workers are most concentrated. It can be said that the workforce of large and medium-sized enterprises is a main part of China's working class. Revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees in these enterprises, making their economic rights and political rights more reliable and tangible. Our democratic construction will have a solid foundation. The employees of large and medium-sized enterprises will also drive and influence the employees of other enterprises, which will better enable China's working class to play a leading role. They will also play a pivotal role in the stable development of the economy, social stability and unity, and the deepening and improvement of reform.

The "national team" is the backbone of the socialist economy. Revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises indeed has many important implications. We must raise our awareness, make concerted efforts, and seriously summarize and promote the experiences of those enterprises that have already been revitalized, so that the "national team" can achieve new heights!

    “国家队”是社会主义经济的“脊梁”
    ——论搞好搞活大中型企业
    本报评论员
    党的十三届四中全会提出的四件大事之一，就是继续搞好治理整顿，坚持改革开放，促进经济持续、稳定、协调发展。江泽民在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年大会上的讲话中指出：“全民所有制大中型企业是我国社会主义现代化建设的主要支柱，是国家财政收入的主要来源。充分发挥它们的骨干作用，对我国经济发展具有特殊重要的意义。”
    但是，目前大中型企业的生产经营面临着许多困难，严重影响了它们作为国民经济支柱骨干作用的发挥。充分认识搞活大中型企业的意义，积极搞活大中型企业，现实地摆到了人们的面前。
    我国全民所有制大中型企业，就数量来说有10676家，仅占全国独立核算工业企业数的2％。但它们拥有的固定资产占全国工业企业总量的64％以上，上交的税利约占全国工业上交税利的68％，是国家的“金库”。他们生产的许多是“上游产品”，并且商品品种多，数量大，档次全，质量好，既是国内市场有效供给的主要提供者，又是参与国际市场竞争的“国家队”。国营大中型企业是我国现代化产业的基本力量，是全国人民长期节衣缩食和企业职工艰苦奋斗攒下的家底，集中了我国各产业部门最先进的技术装备，拥有各个领域最优秀的科技人才和职工队伍。要把经济工作搞好，首先必须把国营大中型企业搞活。从当前来看，这已经成为缓解财政困难和供需矛盾，防止经济滑坡的一个关键。从长远来说，它关系到在本世纪末实现“小康”、到21世纪50年代进入世界中等发达国家行列的战略目标能否实现。
    早在党的十二届三中全会通过的《关于经济体制改革的决定》中，就明确地指出：“具有中国特色的社会主义，首先应该是企业有充分活力的社会主义。”“增强企业的活力，特别是增强全民所有制的大中型企业的活力，是以城市为重点的整个经济体制改革的中心环节。”近几年来，按照这一指导方针，在企业改革方面下功夫，取得了一些效果，特别是承包制的普遍推行和逐步完善，有效地调动了企业和职工群众的积极性。但是，按照企业的能够自主经营、自负盈亏、自我改造、自我发展、自我约束的标准来衡量，已经搞活的大中型企业为数并不很多。大体上说，比较活的约占25％，一般的占50％，活力较差的占25％。这种情况的出现，与在一个时期内在具体工作中对搞活大中型企业重视不够，具体措施落实不够，没有真正把搞活大中型企业放在中心地位有关。
    我国的经济是以公有制为主体的社会主义经济，大中型企业则是社会主义公有制的主要体现者。大中型企业搞得好不好，活不活，实际上是关系到社会主义制度的优越性能否充分发挥和表现的大问题。搞资产阶级自由化的人，借口旧体制下大中型企业、公有制企业活力不够的情况，主张取消公有制，这当然是我们不能同意的。我们必须通过深化改革，并从宏观上创造条件，使大中型企业本来所具有的公有制的优越性充分发挥出来，这就会使社会主义制度的优越性更有说服力，更为大家所认识。这样做，也正是体现了四个坚持和改革开放两个基本点的统一。
    全心全意依靠工人阶级是我们党的一贯的指导思想。大中型企业是产业工人最集中的地方，可以说，大中型企业的职工队伍，是我国工人阶级的一个主体部分。搞好搞活大中型企业，就可以使这些企业的广大职工的积极性、创造性得以充分发挥，使他们的经济权利、政治权利有了更可靠、更切实的保障，我们的民主建设就有了稳固的基础。大中型企业的职工又会带动、影响其他企业的职工，这就可以更好地发挥我国工人阶级的主人翁作用，他们也会更好地在经济的稳定发展、社会的安定团结、改革的深化完善中，起着中流砥柱的作用。
      “国家队”是社会主义经济的“脊梁”。搞好搞活大中型企业，确实具有多方面的重要意义，我们一定要提高认识，切实努力，认真总结和推广那些已经搞活的企业的经验，让“国家队”打出新的水平！
