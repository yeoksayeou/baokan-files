The Great Potential of Agricultural Reclamation

By People's Daily reporter He Jiazheng

It is a "province" that cannot be found on maps. Yet, it possesses 65 million mu of arable land, 5.93 million mu of rubber plantations, and 227 million mu of grasslands, with an annual output value of over 20 billion yuan, truly comparable to the agricultural strength of a province.

The creators of this new "province" are the agricultural reclamation troops. Today, they have 5 million workers and over 10 million people. With less than 4% of the nation's arable land, they provide 10% of the nation's commercial grain, 10% of mechanized white sugar, and over 90% of natural rubber. The former "Great Northern Wilderness" exports soybeans that account for 27.5% of the nation's exports; the former desert produces long-staple cotton that accounts for 75% of the nation's total. More than 85% of the pasteurized milk consumed by urban residents in large and medium-sized cities is supplied by suburban farms, along with a large amount of fish, poultry, and eggs...

Agricultural reclamation has become an indispensable part of China's economic system.

Hard Work and Struggle—The Spiritual Pillar of the Enterprise

A deputy secretary of the Yunnan Agricultural Reclamation Bureau told the reporter: They are currently filming a television series depicting the story of demobilized soldiers settling in the malarial "land of pestilence" and using their hands to open up rubber forests.

Old Qian from the Hainan Agricultural Reclamation Bureau said: "At that time, it was said that 'one seed is worth one piece of gold.' People waited and searched for the rare seeds that fell from the rubber trees to cultivate seedlings, sleeping under the trees infested with insects. With strong willpower and a spirit of self-sacrifice, the soldiers cleared away wild trees and weeds, planting rubber seedlings. Over 40 years, 5 million mu of rubber forests have been established. Now, half of the natural rubber needed by China's industry comes from the rubber plantations in Hainan, Guangdong, and Yunnan.

The creation history of the desert and the Great Northern Wilderness is well-known. Comrades from Xinjiang told the reporter that in the First Corps, almost every regiment has a cemetery around its living quarters, with soldiers and officers of various ranks buried there, who sacrificed their youth and lives for the desert! Barren lands have been transformed into grain and cotton fields, with 1.4 million mu of arable land opened up over 40 years, and an industrial and agricultural output value of 3.7 billion yuan last year. The Heilongjiang Reclamation Area is the largest reclamation area in the country. Over 1 million people have transformed the former "Great Northern Wilderness" into the "Great Northern Granary" through decades of struggle. Now, every two steamed buns eaten by Harbin residents include one produced by the reclamation workers.

In other provinces, almost every farm has a moving story of pioneering and struggle. In Guangdong, in Jiangxi, and even in the bustling Shanghai, the suburban state farms are also places where cadres and educated youth have battled against the tides to reclaim land from the barren shores, sleeping on "rolling beds" and living in dilapidated huts.

It can be said without exaggeration that reclamation workers are pioneers, explorers, and entrepreneurs; the reclamation enterprise is one of hard work, struggle, and continuous exploration. Even today, although production and living conditions have greatly improved and many reclamation areas have taken steps towards modernization, the precious tradition of hard work and struggle has not been lost. Reclamation workers believe that this is not only because the geographical location, natural environment, and economic level of the farms themselves determine that reclamation is still a hard enterprise, but more importantly, any enterprise cannot do without the support of spiritual power.

Reform and Opening Up—The New Era of Agricultural Reclamation

When the decade-long "Cultural Revolution" disaster ended, the agricultural reclamation system had been in continuous deficit for 12 years, plus historical debts, resulting in a net loss of 3 billion yuan in 29 years since the founding of the nation.

Reform and opening up have pushed agricultural reclamation into a new era. First, the emergence of "agriculture-industry-commerce" integrated enterprises broke the single-crop pattern. The internal industrial structure of the farms quickly formed four levels: First, while ensuring grain production, economic crops were developed. By 1988, the area planted with economic crops had increased from 10% of the total area a decade ago to 21%; Second, while ensuring agricultural production, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries were developed. Now, these sectors account for 16.7%, 13.5%, and 8.7% of the total output value, respectively; Third, based on the above two levels, industries using self-produced raw materials were developed. Last year, industrial output value accounted for 60% of the total industrial and agricultural output value; Fourth, commercial, transportation, service, and tourism industries were developed.

The integrated operation of agriculture, industry, and commerce has injected boundless vitality into agricultural reclamation, gradually helping it to say goodbye to poverty and turn losses into profits. More importantly, "agriculture-industry-commerce" has broken the closed pattern of agricultural reclamation, integrating it with the overall national economy. In major cities, people can now feel the presence of "agriculture-industry-commerce," and "agriculture-industry-commerce" product exhibitions are often the most attractive exhibitions.

If the integrated operation opened the doors of agricultural reclamation that had been closed for more than 20 years, then the establishment of family farms is a major reform within the system. In more than 2,000 agricultural reclamation enterprises, there are now over 1.16 million family farms of various types. The forms of family farms are diverse. In terms of labor organization, there are single-family farms, joint-family farms, and single-person farms; in terms of production and operation, there are family farms specializing in planting, breeding, forestry, sideline industries, and transportation, as well as family farms that engage in multiple industries (basic local conditions have been considered). These form the new cells of state farms.

Large farms combined with small farms form an advantageous combination. On one hand, they can fully utilize the planning, coordination, service, and strong allocation capabilities of state farms; on the other hand, they can maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of production cells. In Jiangsu, the province's grain production has stagnated for several consecutive years, but the agricultural reclamation system has achieved a bumper harvest for 12 consecutive years, with stable and high yields. In Qinghai, the grain yield of state farms is significantly higher than that of surrounding villages. The Baigezhuang Farm in Hebei has 270,000 mu of rice fields. Due to the careful management of family farms on one hand and the timely provision of mechanized farming, technology, seeds, fertilizers, and plant protection services by large farms on the other, the average yield per mu reaches 515 jin, with a per capita grain production of 1.2 tons, ranking first in Hebei Province.

In ten years of reform, the agricultural reclamation industry has made rapid progress. In 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value of agricultural reclamation was 25.23 billion yuan, an increase of 2.45 times over 1978, with an average annual growth rate of 12%, achieving the goal of doubling the output value three years ahead of schedule; the total grain output reached 8.49 million tons, an increase of 35.4% over 1978; the total cotton output was 1.68 million tons, an increase of 1.28 times; the total dry rubber output was 2.132 million tons, an increase of 1.24 times; in ten years of reform, profits were made every year, with a profit of 1.7 billion yuan last year, an increase of 400 million yuan over the previous year. With the "rejuvenation" of the farms, the income of the workers has also increased year by year, with an average annual wage of 1,300 yuan last year, an increase of 1.68 times over 1978.

Agricultural reclamation has also bravely stepped onto the world stage. From 1983 to 1986 alone, agricultural reclamation accounted for half of the World Bank's several investment projects in China, with a loan of 280 million US dollars, introducing a large number of technological projects. Last year, the total export commodity procurement value reached 2.53 billion yuan, with nearly 300 varieties of agricultural, sideline, and industrial products exported.

Support and Understanding—The Hopes of Agricultural Reclamation Workers

A great enterprise is accompanied by countless difficulties and hardships. Agricultural reclamation workers hope for further understanding and support from society and yearn for more opportunities for self-development.

Take Xinjiang as an example. They provide about 80% of the long-staple cotton for export in the region but do not even have the autonomy to export a little short-staple cotton. Grain and oil are the same, all have to be handed over. The farms only have production rights, not management rights. There are also different difficulties in other aspects.

For example, in the southern rubber-producing farms, the purchase price of dry rubber set in the 1960s has remained unchanged to this day, making the economic benefits of rubber cultivation significantly lower than other crops, forcing the farms to struggle to support themselves... Agricultural reclamation workers understand the difficulties of the country. Whether in the east, west, south, or north, in their proposed enterprise spirit, there are almost always phrases such as "hard work, consider the overall situation, be innovative, and selflessly contribute." They take pride in contribution and use it to educate cadres and workers. While society should create a better development environment for them.

The future of agricultural reclamation is limitless, and they hope for further reform and opening up.

    农垦——大有作为的事业
    本报记者　何加正
    它，地图上找不到的“省份”。然而，它拥有6500万亩耕地、593万亩胶园、2.27亿亩草地，年创200多亿元产值，确实相当于一个省农业的实力。
    创造出这一新“省”的就是农垦大军。如今，它已拥有500万职工、1000多万人口。以占全国不到4％的耕地，提供全国10％的商品粮、10％的机制白糖、90％以上的天然橡胶。当年的“北大荒”，出口的大豆占全国出口量的27.5％；当年的戈壁滩，生产的长绒棉占全国的75％；大中城市市民饮用的消毒奶，85％以上要由郊区农场提供，还有大量的鱼、禽、蛋……
    农垦，已成为我国经济大系统中不可缺少的一个组成部分。
    艰苦奋斗——事业的精神支柱
    云南农垦局一位副书记告诉记者：他们正在拍一部电视，描写转业官兵在自然环境恶劣的“瘴疠之地”扎下根来，并用双手开辟出一片片胶林的事迹。
    海南农垦局老邢说：“当时叫‘一粒种籽一粒黄金’”。人们为了等待和寻找那偶尔才能见到的从橡胶树上落下来的种籽，以便培育幼苗，一夜夜睡在百虫出没的树下。硬是靠坚强的信念，靠不怕牺牲的精神，战士们铲除了一棵棵杂木野草，栽下一棵棵胶树新苗，40年，500万亩。现在我国工业需要的天然橡胶已有一半来自于海南、广东、云南农垦的橡胶园。
      戈壁滩、北大荒的创业史，人们在电影中已见一斑。新疆的同志告诉记者，在一兵团，几乎每个团住地周围都有一批坟地，长眠在那里的从士兵到班、排、连、营、团长都有，多少人把青春和生命交给了戈壁滩！一片片不毛之地变成粮田、棉田，40年开辟耕地140万亩，去年创造工农业产值37亿元。黑龙江垦区是全国最大的垦区，100多万人经过几十年的奋斗，使昔日的“北大荒”变成了“北大仓”。如今，哈尔滨人每吃两个馒头，其中有一个就是农垦人生产的。
    在其他各省，几乎每一个农场都有一部可歌可泣的拓荒奋斗史。在广东，在江西，就是在灯红酒绿的上海，郊区的国营农场，也是机关干部、知识青年在“潮来一片水，潮退一片沙”的荒滩上，睡着“滚地龙”，住着破草棚，战风斗浪围垦出来的。
    可以毫不夸张地说，农垦人就是垦荒者、开拓者、创业者；农垦事业就是艰苦奋斗、不断开拓的事业。时至今日，尽管生产、生活条件有了极大改善，许多垦区已迈开了现代化的步伐，但那宝贵的艰苦奋斗传统并没有丢。农垦人认为，这不仅因为农场的地理位置、所处的自然环境和经济水平本身决定了农垦仍然是一个艰苦的事业，更重要的是，任何一种事业都离不开精神力量的支撑。
    改革开放——农垦登上新历程
    当十年“文革”灾难结束时，农垦系统已连续亏损12年，加上历史的陈欠，建国29年，农垦净亏损30亿元。
    改革开放把农垦推上新的历程。首先是“农工商”联合企业的出现，打破了单一种粮的局面。农场内部产业结构很快出现了四个层次：第一层，在种植业中，保证粮食连年增产的同时，发展经济作物，到1988年，经济作物播种面积已由10年前占总面积的10％上升为21％；第二层，保证种植业的同时，发展林、牧、副业，如今，这几项在总产值中已分别占到16.7％、13.5％、8.7％；第三层，在以上两项基础上发展自产原料为主的工业。去年工业产值已占工农业总产值的60％；第四层，发展自己的商业、运输业、服务业、旅游业。
    农工商综合经营为农垦注入了无穷的活力，使它逐步开始向贫穷告别，转亏为盈。更重要的是，“农工商”打破了农垦的封闭局面，使之和整个社会经济融为一体。在各大城市，如今人人都能感受到“农工商”的存在，“农工商”产品展销会常常是最吸引人的展销会之一。
    如果说综合经营打开了农垦20多年关闭的大门，那么，家庭农场的兴办则是农垦内部体制的一次重大变革。在2000多个农垦企业里，现在拥有各种类型的家庭农场116万多个。家庭农场的形式五花八门。按劳动组织划分，有单户农场、联户农场、单身职工组成的农场；按生产经营划分，有以种植业、养殖业、林业、副业、运输业为主的各式家庭农场，也有几业兼营的家庭农场（各地基本做到了因地制宜）。由此组成了国营农场新的细胞。
    大农场套小农场，形成了一种优势组合。一方面能充分发挥国营农场的计划、协调、服务和较强的调配能力；一方面，又最大限度地调动和发挥了生产细胞的积极性和创造性。在江苏，全省粮食生产连续几年徘徊，农垦系统却连续12年丰收，连年稳产高产。在青海，国营农场粮食产量明显高于周围农村的产量。河北柏各庄农场27万亩水稻，由于一方面有家庭农场精心照料，一方面大农场又能及时提供机耕、科技、良种、肥料、植保等各种服务，平均亩产达到515公斤，人均产粮1.2吨，居河北省首位。
    改革十年，农垦事业突飞猛进。1988年，农垦的工农业总产值为252.3亿元，比1978年增长2.45倍，年均增长12％，提前三年实现翻一番的目标；粮食总产量达到849万吨，比1978年增长35.4％；棉花总产16.8万吨，增长1.28倍；干胶总产21.32万吨，增长1.24倍；改革十年，年年盈利，去年实现利润17亿元，比上年增加4亿元。随着农场的“翻身”，职工的收入也逐年提高，去年人均工资达到1300元，比1978年增加1.68倍。
    农垦还勇敢地走向世界。仅1983年到1986年，世界银行在我国的几项投资中，农垦就占一半，接受贷款2.8亿美元，引进一大批技术项目。去年出口商品收购总额达到25.3亿元，出口农副土特产品和工业品近300种。
    支持、理解——农垦人的期望
    一项伟大的事业，其间伴随有无数艰难困苦。农垦人期待着社会的进一步理解与支持，渴望得到更多的自我发展机会。
    就以新疆说吧，他们提供全区80％左右的出口长绒棉，却连出口一点短绒的自主权都没有。粮油也一样，要全部上交。农场只有生产权，没有经营权。其他方面也存在不同的难题。
    再如，南方种橡胶的农场，60年代定的干胶收购价格，一直持续到今天，种胶的经济效益明显低于其他，使得各农场不得不艰苦地支撑着……农垦人理解国家的困难。无论东西南北，在他们提出的企业精神中，差不多都有“艰苦奋斗、顾全大局、锐意开拓、无私奉献”等词句。他们以奉献为荣，并以此来教育干部职工。而社会，则应为他们创造更好的发展环境。
    农垦的前途无限，他们寄希望于进一步的改革开放。
