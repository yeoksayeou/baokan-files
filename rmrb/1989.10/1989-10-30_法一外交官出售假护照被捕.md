A French diplomat was recently arrested near Toulouse for selling fake passports. It is believed that this case may help clarify the cause of the crash of a French UTA DC-10 aircraft in Niger last month.

Pierre Lebel, 56, was arrested before serving as the deputy consul at the French Consulate in Conakry, Guinea. Police found that a terrorist killed in a London hotel explosion in August had a fake French passport provided by Lebel. After an in-depth investigation, France's domestic counter-espionage agency, the DGSE, discovered that the deputy consul had provided more than 50 fake French passports to a local businessman in exchange for 50,000 francs. Before the DC-10 was bombed last month, 30 Africans holding fake passports had traveled from Niger to Chad, and their passports were also suspected to have been provided by Lebel. French investigators are attempting to use the Lebel case to uncover the terrorist organization responsible for the bombing of the DC-10.
