Recently, we inspected the tax payments of 74 units in Shaoyang District, Jingmen City, in our province. We discovered that all these units had issues with tax evasion and underpayment, totaling 2.15 million yuan. Surprisingly, over 30 of these units had been recognized as advanced enterprises by various levels of government and their respective supervisory departments. A township enterprise engaged in building materials production evaded and underpaid taxes amounting to over 100,000 yuan from 1988 to June of this year, yet it was named an outstanding enterprise by the provincial relevant departments and the city and township governments last year. The enterprise's leaders were also commended. Another enterprise, from its establishment to the present, has only paid over 100,000 yuan in taxes but has evaded and underpaid nearly 200,000 yuan. However, it has also been named an advanced enterprise multiple times.

We suggest that whether an enterprise pays taxes according to the law should be a criterion for evaluating the performance of enterprises and their leaders. Enterprises and leaders who evade and underpay taxes should not be allowed to proudly stand on the award stage.

　　荆门市的怪事：
　　企业偷漏税　照样当先进
    最近，我们检查了我省荆门市沙洋区74家单位的纳税情况，发现这些单位都存在着偷、漏税问题，总额达215万元。奇怪的是，其中居然有30多家被各级人民政府和各级主管部门评为先进企业。一家从事建材生产的乡镇企业，1988年至今年6月漏欠税10多万元，去年却被省有关部门和市、镇人民政府评为优秀企业，企业的领导人也受到表彰。还有一家企业从建厂至今仅交税1万多元，偷漏税近20万元，但也曾多次被评为先进企业。
    建议把是否照章纳税作为考评企业及领导人政绩的一项内容，不能让那些偷漏税的企业及领导人堂而皇之登上领奖台。
