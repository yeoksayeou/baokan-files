In 1946, the world's first electronic computer was born in the United States, bringing about a profound revolution in human society. In just a few decades, electronic computers have permeated various aspects of social life in many countries.

Just as people are reveling in the immense wealth and convenience brought by computers, a sinister "black hand"—computer crime—has quietly emerged. Recently, officials from relevant departments told us that by the first half of this year, China had discovered and solved 15 cases of computer crimes.

In July 1986, 20,000 yuan and 30,000 Hong Kong dollars from the Shekou branch of the People's Bank of China in Shenzhen vanished without a trace, with the criminals leaving no evidence behind. This case was committed by criminals using computers to forge deposit books and invisible seals to commit fraud. This was the first computer crime case discovered and solved in China.

On December 25, 1987, a certain middle school in Harbin attempted to withdraw 20,000 yuan from a local savings bank, but the bank's computer showed that the school's account balance was only 300 yuan. The depositor immediately raised doubts, and after the bank reported the incident to the police, a detailed investigation revealed that someone had used the computer to commit three crimes, stealing over 19,000 yuan.

The computer theft case at the Desheng Street branch of the Agricultural Bank of China in Chengdu resulted in the highest economic loss among the computer crimes that have occurred in China. In March 1988, the microcomputer operator Xie, along with another person, used their technical skills to modify the bank's computer program, stealing 870,000 yuan in just a few minutes without anyone noticing.

Investigations conducted by relevant state departments on over 50 key national computer systems in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as eight units where computer crimes have occurred, indicate that computer crimes are becoming increasingly prominent, and the forms and types of these crimes are also increasing. In addition to computer fraud cases, there have also been phenomena such as attacks and destruction of computer facilities, as well as the use of computers to leak and steal intelligence.

So, what are the root causes and issues behind the negative effects of computers? Experts believe there are several points:

First, there is a focus on application rather than security, and a lack of awareness of computer security. In recent years, China's computer development and application have progressed rapidly. Currently, the country has over 10,000 large, medium, and small computers and over 300,000 microcomputers, forming a complex network of interconnected systems. However, computer security work has lagged far behind.

Second, there is a lack of well-established regulations and management, leading to chaos and a lack of necessary security supervision links. Although the application of computers is becoming increasingly widespread, the corresponding management mechanisms have not been established in a timely manner. Trust in people has surpassed trust in regulations, and emotions have replaced institutions.

Third, the legal system is not perfect, and there is a lack of legal basis. The emergence of computer crimes has posed a challenge to traditional laws. As a superstructure, the legal system has not responded in a timely manner, and existing laws have not been able to effectively constrain computer crimes. When computer crimes occur, the current approach is to use analogical principles to punish criminals.

According to computer security expert Miao Daoqi's prediction, in the next few years, computer crimes will continue to increase, and the harm they bring to society will be even greater. Therefore, experts suggest:

Strengthening security awareness; strictly implementing management systems and taking preventive measures; controlling the import of electronic computers to prevent the infiltration of foreign illegal forces; and promptly formulating relevant laws and regulations on computer security.

　　警惕电子计算机犯罪
　　陈杰　刘东华
    1946年，世界上第一台电子计算机在美国问世，给人类社会带来了一场深刻的革命。短短几十年，电子计算机已渗透到许多国家的社会生活的各个领域。
    正当人们沉醉于计算机带来的巨大财富和种种方便时，一只罪恶的“黑手”——电子计算机犯罪也悄悄地伸了出来。日前，有关部门的负责同志告诉我们：截至今年上半年，我国发现并破获的计算机犯罪案件已达15起。
    1986年7月，中国人民银行深圳分行蛇口支行的2万元人民币和3万元港币，不翼而飞，罪犯作案后没有留下任何痕迹。此案系犯罪分子利用计算机伪造存折和隐形印鉴进行的诈骗。这是在我国发现并破获的第一起计算机犯罪案。
    1987年12月25日，哈尔滨某中学欲在当地储蓄所领取该校的2万元款项，可银行计算机却显示该校存款余额仅为300元。储户当即质疑，银行报警后，经详细侦察，发现有人利用计算机三次作案，取走人民币1.9万多元。
    在我国发生的计算机犯罪中，经济损失最多的一起是成都市农业银行德胜街营业部的计算机盗窃案。1988年3月，德胜街营业部微机操作员谢某，伙同一人凭借娴熟的技术，修改了银行的计算机程序，几分钟内就神不知鬼不觉地盗取了87万元人民币。
    国家有关部门对京、津、沪等地的50多个国家重点计算机系统和已发生计算机犯罪的8个单位进行的调查表明，计算机犯罪日渐突出，犯罪的形式和类型也在增多。除计算机诈骗案外，还出现了诸如袭击和破坏计算机设施，利用计算机泄密和窃取情报等犯罪现象。
    那么，造成计算机负效应的根源和症结何在？专家们认为有以下几点：
    第一，重应用，轻安全，计算机的安全意识淡薄。近年来，我国的计算机开发和应用发展很快，目前全国已拥有大、中、小型计算机1万余台，微型机30余万台，并形成了纵横交错的联机网络。然而，计算机安全工作却远远落在后面。
    第二，规章制度不健全，管理混乱，缺乏必要的安全监察环节。虽然计算机的应用日趋广泛，与之相适应的管理机制却没有及时建立起来。对人的信任，超过了对规章制度的信任，感情替代了制度。
    第三，法制不完善，缺少法律依据。计算机犯罪的出现，向传统法律提出了挑战，作为上层建筑的法律制度对此没有及时作出反应，已有的法律，已不能对计算机犯罪形成有效的约束力。当发生计算机犯罪时，目前只能采取类推原则对罪犯进行制裁。
    据计算机安全专家缪道期预测，今后几年里，计算机犯罪还会成倍增长，给社会带来的危害还会更大。为此，专家们建议：
    增强安全意识；严格管理制度，落实防范措施；控制电子计算机的进口，避免国外不法势力的渗透；尽快制订有关计算机安全方面的法律、法规。
