Today's edition of the *Market Report* published an article discussing the phenomenon of consumers hoarding money, titled "Neither Panic Buying Nor Hoarding Is Advisable."

The article reports that this year, market sales have been sluggish, with many goods severely backlogged. Despite commercial units implementing "discount" sales with discounts ranging from 5% to 50%, many consumers still choose to hold onto their money. This is a lingering effect of last year's panic buying spree.

The article argues that the four waves of panic buying in 1988 were triggered by continuous price increases. Consumers, who had been in a state of consumption deprivation for many years, sensed the threat of inflation and currency devaluation. To protect their own interests, they rushed to buy goods as a means of preserving value. The panic buying exacerbated the shortage of goods, and prices surged even higher. Now, consumers are reflecting on the panic buying: money that could have bought a refrigerator and a color TV a year or two ago can now only buy one item. Was it worth it? Producers and operators are waiting for the next sales peak, but things did not go as planned.

Where did the problem lie? The article suggests that prices suppressed consumption. As one consumer put it, "After saving for two or three years, buying a color TV required borrowing money. The panic buying left me at a loss." Some who managed to buy "hot items" during the panic buying are now regretting it. Some have learned from their mistakes and are choosing to wait and see. This is the basic mindset of some consumers today.

The article then shifts from discussing hoarding to consumers' self-protection awareness, noting that this year's market sales have been cool with some heat. Take the 1989 Beijing Fashion Week, for example: initially, tickets priced at 5 jiao were scalped for 5 yuan; after the opening, crowds flocked in, and the first few days saw daily sales reaching 200,000 yuan. This shows that consumers' desire to consume is still very strong. They hope to compare prices and buy quality goods at reasonable prices at exhibitions. Spending money to get the best return—this is the experience people have drawn from the panic buying.

The article also discusses a potential threat to the market: the accumulation of massive purchasing power could lead to a new wave of panic buying. It believes that the policies of rectification and deepening reform are playing a good role in eliminating inflation, especially in stabilizing prices, which has given consumers some reassurance. However, these measures have only alleviated consumers' fear of currency devaluation and have not eliminated their pursuit of high consumption. It should also be noted that in some places, price stability has been achieved largely through administrative measures, and the material conditions for price stability are not yet fully in place. Various price increase impulses still exist, and the phenomenon of industrial products increasing in price in different regions is a clear example. Currently, social purchasing power is quite strong, but effective supply cannot keep up. If macro-control is not strengthened, there is a possibility of a new wave of panic buying.

The article concludes by saying that consumers' phenomenon of holding onto their money is temporary. What will the market sales situation be like next year? Various predictions abound. However, one point is relatively consistent. Since the second half of this year, many goods, especially household appliances, have seen prices fall or are falling back to a level that is basically in line with their value. If this appropriate price can be stabilized, consumers will psychologically accept it and proceed to normal purchasing.

The *Market Report* also published an editorial titled "Normal Shopping Is Most Economical."

### 《市场报》发表文章提醒消费者  抢购惜购均不可取  正常购物才最实惠

    《市场报》发表文章提醒消费者
    抢购惜购均不可取  正常购物才最实惠
    本报讯　今天出版的《市场报》针对消费者的惜购现象发表记者述评，题目是《抢购、惜购，都不可取》。
    今年，市场销售疲软，一些商品严重积压。尽管商业单位纷纷实行“让利”销售，幅度大到5％—50％，但不少消费者仍持币待购。这是去年抢购风留下的后遗症。
    述评认为，1988年的4次抢购风潮，是物价持续上涨引发的。多年处于消费饥渴状态的消费者，预感到通货膨胀、货币贬值的威胁，出于维护自身利益的需要，纷纷购物保值。抢购风造成商品更加短缺，物价借助抢购风以更大幅度上涨。现在消费者对抢购风进行反思了：一两年前够买冰箱和彩电的钱，眼下只能买一件，值不值？生产者、经营者却在等待新的销售旺季来临，结果事与愿违。
    问题出在哪里？述评认为，是价格抑制了消费。用一位消费者的话讲：“辛辛苦苦攒了两三年，买台彩电要借钱，抢购风使我吃了大亏。”一些抢购到“俏货”的人们，今天也后悔不迭。有人吃一堑长一智，等等再说吧！这是当前一些消费者的基本心态。
    述评接着从惜购谈到了消费者的自我保护意识，指出：今年市场销售冷中有热。就拿1989年北京时装节来说，开幕之初，5角钱一张的门票，黑市价卖到5元；开幕后，观众如云，最初几日，日销货额达20万元。这说明消费者的消费欲望仍然十分强烈，他们渴望在展销会上货比三家，买到质优价廉的商品。花钱要花出最佳效益——这是人们在经历抢购风之后总结出的经验。消费者自我保护意识增强，可说是件好事。
    这篇述评还谈到市场的一个潜在威胁，即由于积聚了巨大的购买力，出现新的抢购风也不是不可能。它认为，治理整顿、深化改革的方针，在消除通货膨胀方面发挥着良好作用，特别是稳定物价，给消费者吃了颗定心丸。然而，这些仅仅是消除了消费者惧怕货币贬值的担心，而没有根除消费者追求高消费的动力。还应该看到，一些地方稳定物价，在很大程度上靠的是行政措施，物价稳定的物质条件还没有完全具备，各种涨价冲动仍然存在，工业品易地涨价就是明显的例子。现在社会购买力相当强大，而有效供给又跟不上，如果宏观调控不力，不排除出现新的抢购的可能性。
    述评最后说，消费者持币观望的现象是暂时的。明年的市场销售状况如何？各种预测纷纭。然而，有一点是比较一致的。从今年下半年以来，不少商品，特别是家用电器，价格已经回落或正在回落到基本上与价值相符的水平。这种适当的价格如能稳定，消费者心理上就会接受，进而正常购买。
    《市场报》还发表了题为《正常购物最实惠》的社论。
