The title might seem to suggest that the sum of these two numbers is 100%, but in reality, these two figures do not represent a simple additive relationship. They indicate that among the advanced producers selected by the Jilin Chemical Industry Company, 75% are party members, while party members make up only 25% of the workforce. Although party members are a minority among the masses, they are at the forefront and achieve the most, thereby inspiring the majority. From this perspective, it is not surprising that Jilin Chemical Industry Company has great cohesion, a clean atmosphere, and high economic benefits.

In most enterprises, party members generally make up a minority. The question is whether they can all be like the party members of Jilin Chemical Industry Company and make up the majority of the vanguard ranks. Due to various reasons, some units' party members, influenced by the domestic "small climate" in recent times, have gradually forgotten that they are Communist Party members, blending themselves with the ordinary masses. Some even say, "Party members are also people, why should they always bear the brunt and suffer first?" With such a mindset, it is natural that they cannot lead the way. No wonder some people say that such party members are no different from ordinary people except for paying more party dues. If party members are like this, it is hard for the masses to have the motivation.

The 75% and 25% of Jilin Chemical Industry Company indeed give one much to think about. It is hoped that more units' Communist Party members can truly play the role of vanguards and models like the party members of Jilin Chemical Industry Company. Only then will there be hope for the revitalization of the country.

　　75％和25％
　　金川
    看标题，似乎两数之和正好是100％，其实这两个数字所表示的并不是简单相加的关系。它说的是，吉林化学工业公司评选出的先进生产者中党员占了75％，而党员在职工中的比例不过25％。党员在群众中是少数，而冲锋在前，做出成绩的却占了多数，以此又带动了大多数的群众。由此看来，吉化公司有巨大的凝聚力，有清正的风气，有很高的经济效益，就不奇怪了。
    在一般企业里，党员占的比例大抵是少数，问题在于是不是都能像吉化公司那样，占了先进行列中的多数呢？由于种种原因，有些单位的党员在前一阵国内“小气候”的影响下，逐渐忘记了自己是个共产党员，把自己混同于普通的群众，甚至说什么：党员也是人，干嘛要事事吃苦在先、吃亏在前？抱着这样的想法，自然不能走在前面。难怪有群众说，这样的党员比群众不就多交个党费吗？党员尚且如此，群众也就难有劲头。
    吉化公司的75％和25％，确实发人深省，愿有更多单位的共产党员像吉化的党员那样真正发挥先锋模范作用，如此，国家的振兴才有希望。
