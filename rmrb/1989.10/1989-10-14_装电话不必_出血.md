Installing a Telephone Need Not Be a Financial Burden

Sigh! When it comes to installing a telephone, my heart feels like a pot of mixed flavors, and I can't quite tell what it tastes like.

In recent years, the demand for installing residential telephones has been growing stronger each year. In 1986, Changchun City installed 3,000 units, with 5,000 households waiting; in 1987, another 4,000 units were installed, and the waiting list increased to 7,000 households; in 1988, 5,000 more units were installed, and the waiting list surged to 13,000 households; in 1989, 7,000 units can be installed, but currently, there are 15,000 households waiting. Due to the difficulties in installing residential telephones, even I, a secretary of the provincial postal and telecommunications bureau, have become quite busy, often running around to help others install telephones. In November 1986, a colleague from the Municipal Letters and Visits Office, after much effort, found me: "We want to install a telephone at home. I heard that the bribe is quite heavy, so I dare not proceed. I came to seek your help." I said, "The postal and telecommunications department will not make things difficult for you. Just follow the normal procedures to apply." He kept shaking his head. My persuasion was ineffective, so I had to toughen up and go to the service window to handle it for him. Soon, he sent a calendar to thank me: "Thanks to you, the telephone is installed." I told him that I did not know those business personnel and had not revealed my identity. He simply did not believe it. Such situations occur several times a year.

Is installing a telephone really that easy? Not entirely. In areas where lines are abundant, it seems easier, but in areas where lines are scarce, it is more difficult. Some line workers demand that users treat them to meals or give gifts and ask users to find acquaintances to help with a bit of favor. In April 1987, a neighbor, following my advice, went to the service window to apply for installation, but after waiting for a long time without any response, he went to inquire multiple times before getting an answer: "No spare line, cannot be installed." The neighbor pleaded repeatedly, and I found a familiar line worker, who spent an entire morning checking and finally found a spare line. After finding the line, waiting for payment took another seven or eight days; then finding someone, paying the fee, and still not seeing anyone come to install the telephone. Seeing that a month had passed, the neighbor urged me, and I felt ashamed, going to find the installer every day, but couldn't even find their trace. One day, I went to the telecommunications bureau and saw that the installation team had dozens of large and small vehicles, and all the installers had been taken away by users, with some latecomers having to leave empty-handed. Installers have become "hot commodities," and if you sit at home waiting for them to come and install the telephone, who knows when you will have to wait! Helpless, I had to find a car for the neighbor. The telephone was installed, but the sub-bureau did not accept it, so it could not be used, and I had to find someone. Sometimes, to install one telephone, I had to run around ten or eight times. Some people, knowing this, would say, "Even with internal connections, it is so troublesome. Without connections, forget about installing a telephone."

As a postal and telecommunications official, I understand the difficulties of the telecommunications department in trying to curb improper practices but finding it hard to stop or give up. I also deeply understand the plight of many users who are willing to be "sacrificed" to install a telephone. Out of sympathy and indignation, I also wanted to delve deeper into the root causes of the difficulties in telephone installation. In recent years, whenever someone asked me to help install a telephone, I would do my best to help, but the troubles I encountered kept increasing. In April 1988, an old classmate who worked in a provincial direct-organization came to ask me, "How much does it cost to install a residential telephone?" I said, "700 yuan is enough." I accompanied the line worker to check the lines, but there was no spare line. My classmate thought I was unwilling to help, so he asked someone else and spent 1,400 yuan to install the telephone. My classmate was angry and stopped talking to me. Over the years, to help others install residential telephones, I have tasted all the flavors of life.

This year, Changchun City Telecommunications Bureau established the City Telephone Center, formulated strict regulations, and users only need to go to the service window once to apply and pay once to install the telephone. If someone accepts gifts or bribes, as long as the amount reaches 80 yuan, they will be expelled from the bureau. In the first half of this year, Changchun City Telecommunications Bureau did not find any cases of users applying for telephone installation without a response, or line workers demanding gifts. Instead, there were 46 instances of installation and relocation personnel refusing gifts, and 32 letters of commendation from users. Now, Changchun City Telecommunications Bureau announces to users every day which applicants can install the telephone immediately, which need to wait for how long to install, and which do not yet meet the installation conditions. Users only need to go through the normal channels to handle the installation procedures and can get accurate answers.

It is puzzling that some people still do not believe that "telephones can be installed without paying a bribe" and continue to use connections and backdoors as before, causing postal and telecommunications officials like me to endlessly persuade and run around, without peace. Just in the first half of this year, more than 10 people came to me for help with telephone installation, how can I not be busy!

Going through the front door instead of the back door often leads to being cheated. A worker from the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry claimed to know the leaders of Changchun City Telecommunications Bureau and extorted money and goods from those who desperately wanted to install telephones. Then, he went to the telecommunications bureau service window to apply for installation through normal channels. As a result, although some users installed the telephone, they spent a lot of "big money." I really hope that users will not look at this matter with old eyes and try going to the telecommunications bureau themselves, reducing the troubles of postal and telecommunications officials like me and blocking the paths of those who engage in crooked practices.

### 装电话不必“出血”

    装电话不必“出血”
    唉！说起装电话，我心里就像打翻了五味瓶，品不出是啥滋味儿。
    近几年，人们要求装住宅电话的一年胜过一年。长春市1986年装上3000台，待装户有5000户；1987年又装了4000台，待装户增到7000户；1988年再装了5000台，待装户猛增到13000户；1989年可装7000台，而目前待装户已达到15000户。由于住宅电话安装困难，我这个省邮电局的秘书竟然也红火起来了，不得不经常为别人安装电话而奔波。1986年11月，市信访局一位同志辗转求人找到我：“家里想装台电话，听说人情费挺重，不敢操持，特来求助。”我说：“邮电部门不会有人难为你，按正常手续去办吧！”他直摆手。劝说无效，我只好硬着头皮到营业窗口替他代办。不久，他送本挂历来谢我：
  “亏你出面，电话装上了。”我告诉他，那些业务人员我根本不认识，也没有暴露身份。他根本不相信。像这种情况，每年都有几次。
    装电话真就那么容易么？也不尽然。机线宽松的区域似乎好办些，可部分机线紧缺的区域就难办了。有的机线人员要用户请吃送礼，要用户托熟人来搭点人情。1987年4月，一位邻居听信我的劝告，自己去窗口办理申请装机手续，久等无音讯，跑去多次催问方得答复：“没空线，装不成。”邻居再三恳求，我找到一位熟识的线务员，整整查了一上午，终于查得一空线。查到线，等交款，一等又是七八天；再找人，交上款，迟迟不见来装机。眼看一个月过去了，邻居催，我汗颜，天天去找装机员，可连踪迹都寻不见。某日，我到电信局一看，装机班前大小车辆数十台，装机人员上班刚到，全部被用户拉走了，一些来晚的用户只好空车而归。装机员成了“抢手货”，你呆坐家里傻等人家上门装机要待何时！无奈，我只得替邻居找车。电话装上了，分局没验收就不能通话，还得找人。有时，为了安装一台电话我就得跑十趟八趟。有的人知道后，便说：“内部有熟人都那么费劲儿，没门子就甭想装电话。”
    作为邮电公务人员，我理解电信部门刹不正之风欲禁不止、欲罢不忍的难处，也深知众多用户为装上一台电话甘愿被“宰”的苦衷。出于同情、出于愤慨，也想更多更深地摸清电话装机难的症结。近几年凡找我帮忙装电话的，我都有求必应，结果增添的苦恼越来越多。1988年4月，在省直机关任职的一位老同学来问我：“装台住宅电话要花多少钱？”我说：“700元就够了。”我陪同线务员一起去查线，结果没有空线。老同学认为我不肯帮忙，又托别人，花了1400元装上了电话。老同学生气了，从此不理我了。几年来，为了帮助别人装上住宅电话，我尝够了酸、甜、苦、辣。
    今年，长春市电信局成立了市话中心局，制定了严格的规章制度，用户只需到营业窗口办一次申请，交一次款就可装机。如果有人吃请收礼，只要款额达到80元，就会受到开除局籍处分。今年上半年，长春市电信局没有发现用户申请装电话无回音，机线人员吃拿卡要的现象，而装拆移机人员拒吃请、拒收礼就达46次，收到用户书面表扬32件。现在，长春市电信局每天都向用户公告哪些申请户马上可以装机，哪些需等多久才能装机，哪些尚不具备装机条件，用户只要走正常渠道去办理装机手续，都能得到准确的答复。
    令人不解的是，现在，有些人仍不相信装电话“不出血也能办成”，还是一如既往地托关系走后门，害得工作在邮电部门的公务员无休止地劝来劝去、跑来跑去，不得安宁。仅今年上半年，找我帮助装电话的就有10多人，能不忙么！
    正门不走偏走后门，往往受骗上当。长春市应用化学研究所一位职工诡称认识长春市电信局领导，从迫切想装电话的人们那里勒索钱物。然后，他按正常渠道去电信局营业窗口办理申请装机手续。结果一些用户虽然装上了电话，但花了不少“大头钱”。我多么希望用户不再用老眼光去看待此事，都能亲自到电信局去试一试，减轻一点像我这样的邮电公务员的烦恼，堵住一些人搞歪门邪道的路。
