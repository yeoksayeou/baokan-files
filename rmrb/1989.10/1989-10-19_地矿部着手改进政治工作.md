    The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources is currently taking steps to improve the content and methods of ideological and political work within the geology and mineral resources system. Minister Zhu Xun, at a recent political work conference held by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, proposed that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen the education of Marxist theory and basic Party knowledge for all employees. At the same time, efforts should be made to promote industry-specific ideological education, and to vigorously promote the spirit of "three glories": honoring dedication to the geology industry, honoring hard work, and honoring the discovery of mineral resources.

    The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has decided to restore and strengthen the political work team, and to re-establish the "Political Department." Political work cadres will be allocated at a ratio of 1.5% of the total number of employees.
