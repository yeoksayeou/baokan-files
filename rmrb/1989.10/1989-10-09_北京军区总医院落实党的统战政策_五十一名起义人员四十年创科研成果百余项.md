The Party Committee of the Beijing Military Region General Hospital has earnestly implemented the Party's policy towards former Nationalist Army personnel who have surrendered. They have treated the 51 former Nationalist Army medical personnel in the hospital equally in political matters, relied on and trusted them in professional work, and cared for them in their daily lives. These former Nationalist Army personnel have responded with redoubled efforts, achieving over 130 scientific research results in the past 40 years.

These 51 comrades were originally medical personnel of the Nationalist Army's Beijing Military Liaison Hospital. In January 1949, they followed General Fu Zuoyi in surrendering and joined the ranks of the People's Liberation Army. Now, 45 of these 51 comrades have joined the Communist Party of China; 25 have obtained intermediate or senior professional titles. The hospital has also assigned business assistants to senior doctors who are advanced in age and established a file room. To make use of the expertise of retired professionals, the hospital has established an expert group and opened expert clinics. Additionally, the hospital has created various conditions to allow these comrades to participate in academic discussions organized by various social groups. Currently, 12 comrades have been elected as members of the Chinese Medical Association's professional committees, 7 have gone abroad for study and research, 19 have attended international and domestic academic conferences, and 2 have been elected as Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference members and National People's Congress representatives. In terms of living conditions, the hospital has built a specialist building for them and given priority in housing, car use, and employment for their children.

These comrades have lived up to expectations. They have dedicated themselves to the cause of military medicine. So far, 31 comrades have been awarded for their meritorious service, received awards, or been conferred honorary titles. Chief Military Doctor Hu Mingdao of the Thoracic Surgery Department, who is in his seventies, still insists on working on the front lines to save wounded officers and soldiers from the martial law troops. The Standing Committee of the Military Technology Committee of the entire army and Director of the Military Hepatitis Research Institute, Jia Keming, has led his technical personnel to work hard on breakthroughs, achieving 75 technological results. Among them, the "radioimmunoassay method" won the National Science Conference Award, and the "research on hepatitis B polypeptide vaccine" and 7 other results won the second prize for military scientific and technological achievements. Member of the Beijing Orthopedics Branch of the Chinese Medical Association and Director of the Military Trauma Orthopedics Specialized Technology Center, Xu Shaoting, has chosen clinical emergency topics for breakthroughs and conducted research on spinal cord injuries, providing scientific basis for the early treatment of traumatic paraplegia. This result has attracted attention at the International Biliary Academic Conference. Chief Pharmacist Sun Dingren of the Pharmacy Department, based on the actual needs of the hospital, has manufactured a "sterile semi-automatic preparation of large-volume infusion process," making the qualified rate of infusion products reach 99% or above, and won the first prize for military scientific and technological achievements.

    北京军区总医院落实党的统战政策
    五十一名起义人员四十年创科研成果百余项
    本报讯　北京军区总医院党委，认真贯彻落实党对起义人员的政策，对全院51名原国民党军队起义人员，政治上一视同仁，业务上依靠信任，生活上关心爱护。这些起义人员以加倍努力的工作回答共产党的关怀，40年来共取得130多项科研成果。
    这51名老同志，原是国民党北平陆军联勤总医院的医务工作者，1949年1月跟随傅作义将军起义，加入了中国人民解放军行列。如今，这51名老同志中，已有45人加入了中国共产党；25名同志获中、高级技术职称。同时，医院还为年事已高的老主任配备了业务助手，建立起资料档案室。为了发挥退居二线的专家的余热，这个医院还成立了专家组，开设专家门诊。此外，医院多方创造条件，让这些老同志参加社会各方组织的学术研讨活动。目前已有12名同志分别担任了中华医学会专业分会理事，7名同志出国学习考察，19名同志出席了国际、国内学术会议，还有两名同志当选为北京市政协委员和全国人大代表。在生活上，医院还为他们修建了专家楼，在住房、用车、子女就业上，给予优先安排。
    这些老同志不负重望，他们一心一意献身于国防医学事业，已有31名同志立功、受奖，或被授予荣誉称号。胸外科主任军医胡明道，年已古稀，仍坚持在临床第一线救护戒严部队负伤官兵。全军军事技术委员会常委、全军肝病研究所主任贾克明，带领科技人员努力攻关，已研究出75项科技成果，其中“放射免疫自显影测定法”，荣获全国科学大会奖；“乙型肝炎多肽疫苗研究”等7项成果，荣获全军科技成果二等奖。中华医学会北京骨科分会会员、全军创伤骨科专科技术中心主任胥少汀，选择临床急需课题攻关，开展对脊髓损伤的研究，为创伤性截瘫的早期治疗提供了科学依据。这项成果在国际胆道学术会议上，引起与会者重视。药械科主任药师孙定人，根据医院的实际需要，制造出“洁净半自动制备大输液流程”，使输液成品的合格率达99％以上，荣获全军科技成果一等奖。　（张梅珍　崔长生）
