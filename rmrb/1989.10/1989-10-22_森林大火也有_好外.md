Forest fires often severely damage valuable timber resources and threaten the lives of humans and animals living in or around forest areas, thus they are called "disasters." However, American scientists, after conducting a series of investigations in Yellowstone Park following a major fire, have declared: although forest fires are undoubtedly "bad," they can also bring some unexpected "benefits."

It is well known that Yellowstone Park, covering 2.2 million acres, is one of the world's largest natural parks. The park is covered with forests, grasslands, mountains, and water bodies, and is a paradise for countless elk, bison, grizzly bears, and antelopes. Last summer, the park experienced the largest fire in 116 years, affecting 45% of the park's area. The most severely damaged were the dense old-growth forests. At the time, scientists estimated that in the areas most affected by the fire, it would take at least ten years before green vegetation would reappear. However, to the scientists' surprise, just one year after the fire, many charred trees have sprouted fresh green shoots, new seedlings have emerged from the ground, and even some wildflowers have bloomed tenaciously, as if defying the fire god...

Experts analyzed that the fire destroyed most of the old trees but accelerated the forest's metabolism, so that the forest no longer had dense shade blocking the sunlight, allowing the grass and trees to grow more vigorously with sufficient sunlight; the burned branches and leaves turned into ash, enriching the soil and providing abundant nutrients for the plants; the fire cracked open the hard-to-open pine cones, which was equivalent to sowing more seeds; the disappearance of many herbivores also reduced the number of predators...

From this perspective, scientists believe that the fire is actually a "driving force" for the regeneration of nature. It is estimated that in 100 to 200 years, the overgrown forests in Yellowstone Park will experience another major fire, and that fire will again drive a new cycle. Mysterious nature guides this world to move forward, making it never stagnate...

### 森林大火也有“好外”

　　森林大火也有“好外”
    森林大火往往极大地破坏宝贵的木材资源，并威胁到居住或生活在林区周围的人类或动物的生命安全，因而称之为“灾难”。但最近美国科学家在对大火后的黄石公园进行一系列考察后却宣称：虽然森林大火无疑是件“坏事”，但又会带来一些意想不到的“好处”。
    众所周知，占地220万英亩的黄石公园是世界上最大的自然公园之一，公园覆盖着森林、草原、山地和水域，是无数麋鹿、野牛、灰熊和羚羊生活的乐土。去年夏天，公园发生了116年以来最大的一次火灾，大火波及了公园45％的面积，受损最为严重的是公园中郁郁葱葱的茂密老林。当时科学家们估计，在火势最大的一些林区，起码要在十年后才会重新看到绿地。然而令科学家们大感惊讶的是，在大火后刚刚才一年的今天，不少焦黑的树木竟绽出了葱绿的新芽，地面上也有新苗破土而出，甚至还有不少野花顽强地开放着，仿佛是向火神挑战……专家们分析说：大火毁灭了大部分老树，却加速了森林的新陈代谢，使林中不再有挡住阳光的浓荫，于是林中草木因能获取足够的阳光而生长更加茂盛；烧成灰烬的残枯枝叶又使林中土壤更为肥沃，给草木提供了丰富的养料；大火爆开了难以炸裂的球果，无异于撒下了更多的种子；众多食草动物的消失又减少了啃食的天敌……
    由此科学家们认为，从另一种角度看，大火实际上是大自然循环中一种再生的“原动力”。估计一二百年后，黄石公园内过度茂盛的森林将会再出现一次大火，而且那场大火又将带动一次新的循环。神秘的大自然引导着这个世界不断向前，使它永远不会衰竭……
