Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee on Overseas Chinese Affairs, He Ying, recently emphasized in an interview with reporters that in promoting the great cause of China's peaceful reunification, reform and opening up, and the Four Modernizations, the tens of millions of overseas Chinese and all descendants of the Yellow Emperor are a tremendous force. We must adopt more open policies, especially through relevant legislation to protect their legitimate rights and interests, to mobilize their enthusiasm, and to contribute to promoting China's Four Modernizations, achieving peaceful reunification, and fostering friendly relations between the countries where they reside and China.

He Ying believes that the most important task currently is to actively help overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent clarify and dispel their misunderstandings and doubts about our suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He said that some overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent have misunderstandings and doubts about China's suppression of the turmoil and rebellion mainly because they lack understanding of the nature of the rebellion. They have not seen that this rebellion is a small group of counter-revolutionary rioters and some social dregs, along with those stubbornly advocating bourgeois liberalization, supported by hostile forces abroad and reactionary elements in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, who are madly opposing the Communist Party of China, the socialist system, and attempting to overthrow the People's Republic of China through the rebellion to establish a bourgeois republic subordinate to imperialism. Additionally, the Western and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan media have fabricated a large number of lies and distorted reports, and some domestic propaganda units have had incorrect guidance for a period, greatly influencing the thoughts and emotions of overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent, leading to some misunderstandings and doubts, which is completely understandable.

He Ying emphasized that we firmly believe in one thing: that is, the vast majority of overseas Chinese and descendants of the Yellow Emperor with a conscience love the People's Republic of China and hope for the revival and rise of the Chinese nation. Therefore, as they gradually understand the truth of the matter, some lies are exposed, and their recognition of the significance of our suppression of the turmoil and rebellion improves, seeing that the situation in the motherland is further stabilizing, and the basic policies towards both domestic and foreign affairs remain unchanged, these misunderstandings and doubts will gradually be dispelled. The facts over the past few months have also proven that now more and more overseas compatriots are coming back to visit, tour, invest, and participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, which shows that the vast majority of overseas compatriots are devoted to their motherland.

He Ying said that now the most concerning issue for overseas Chinese is whether China's policy of reform and opening up will change. This question has been completely and clearly answered by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and the new central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, emphasizing that the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up are the path to strength, which will not change. As for the overall policy of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and the legal rights and interests of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, it has long been included in the Constitution of our country and will certainly not change. He said that to ensure that overseas Chinese have laws to follow in all aspects of political, economic, and social life, the National People's Congress Standing Committee on Overseas Chinese Affairs has taken the task of overseas Chinese legislation and the implementation of overseas Chinese policies as its main tasks, and is currently studying and formulating the "Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Overseas Chinese Investment," "Measures for Overseas Chinese Donations," "Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Returned Overseas Chinese and Their Relatives," and "Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Overseas Chinese," gradually moving from mainly relying on policies to a path of law-based governance.

    广大海外侨胞心向祖国  通过立法做好侨务工作
    新华社北京十月五日电　全国人大华侨委员会副主任委员何英日前在接受记者采访时指出，在促进祖国和平统一和改革开放以及社会主义四化建设的伟大事业中，海外数千万侨胞和所有炎黄子孙是一支巨大的力量。我们要采取更加开放的政策，特别是通过有关立法保护他们的正当权利、合法权益，调动他们的积极性，为促进我国四化建设，完成和平统一大业，以及促进所在国与我国友好关系发展，作出新的贡献。
    何英认为，要做好海外华侨、华人的工作，当前最主要的是要积极地帮助他们澄清和消除他们对我们平息这场反革命暴乱的一些误解和疑虑。他说，海外一些侨胞、外籍华人之所以对我国制止动乱、平息暴乱存在一些误解和疑虑，主要是由于他们对这场暴乱的实质缺乏了解，没有看清这场暴乱是国内一小撮反革命暴乱分子和一些社会渣滓以及顽固坚持搞资产阶级自由化的人在国外敌对势力和港澳台反动分子的支持下，疯狂反对中国共产党，反对社会主义制度，妄图通过暴乱颠覆中华人民共和国，建立附庸于帝国主义的资产阶级共和国，加上西方和港澳台的新闻媒介制造了大量谎言，进行了歪曲报道，以及国内一些宣传单位一个时期的错误舆论导向，使得海外华侨、华人的思想情绪受到极大的影响，产生了一些误解和疑虑，这是完全可以理解的。
    何英强调说，但我们坚信一点，这就是：广大的华侨和有良知的炎黄子孙是热爱中华人民共和国，希望中华民族振兴、腾飞的。因此，随着他们对事件真相的逐步了解，一些谎言被揭穿，识破，对我们制止动乱、平息暴乱意义的认识的提高，看到祖国局势进一步趋于稳定，对内对外的大政方针不变，这些误解和疑虑是会逐步消除的。几个月以来的事实也已经证明，现在回来参观、访问、探亲、旅游、投资，回来参加建国四十周年庆典的海外同胞已越来越多，这说明广大海外同胞是心向祖国的。
    何英说，现在海外侨胞最关心的问题是我国改革、开放的政策是否会变。这个问题，党的十三届四中全会和以江泽民总书记为核心的新的中央领导集体已经作出了完全肯定和十分明确的回答，强调指出四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国之路，是绝不会改变的。至于维护海外华侨正当权益和维护归国华侨和侨眷的合法权益的总政策，早已载入我国宪法，更不会有改变。他说，为了让广大侨胞在政治生活、经济生活和社会生活各方面都有法可依，全国人大华侨委员会已把侨务立法工作和检查落实侨务政策作为主要任务来抓，正在着手研究制定《华侨投资优惠条例》、《华侨捐赠办法》、《保护归侨、侨眷权益法》、《保护华侨权益法》等，使侨务工作从主要靠政策办事，逐步走上依法办事的轨道。
