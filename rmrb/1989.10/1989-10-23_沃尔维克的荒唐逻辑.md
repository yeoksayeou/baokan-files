The Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee openly awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama, who has long been engaged in activities to split the motherland. This action, which hurts the feelings of the Chinese people and grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, has naturally been condemned by the Chinese people and people of justice around the world. However, as the chairman of the committee, Worvik, instead of reflecting on the evil consequences of this wrong decision, became angry and abusive, launching vicious attacks on China in a most arrogant and unreasonable manner.

Worvik claims that the reaction of the Chinese people to the awarding of the prize to the Dalai Lama is an "unfriendly act," and that China is trying to "take risks." This is a complete distortion of right and wrong, a case of the pot calling the kettle black. China is a sovereign state composed of multiple ethnic groups, and Tibet has been a sacred territory of China since ancient times. This is a fact recognized by the world. There is no country in the world whose government considers Tibet to be a "state." Maintaining the unity of the motherland and achieving harmony and unity among all ethnic groups is the unanimous will of all ethnic groups in China. The decision by the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee to award the peace prize to the Dalai Lama is a gross interference in China's internal affairs, a very unfriendly act. China's protest to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee is a legitimate right of any sovereign state. Yet Worvik accuses China of making a "stern rebuttal" as an "unfriendly act." Does this mean that allowing you to blatantly support the Dalai Lama's separatist activities and interfere in China's internal affairs is considered a "friendly act"? What kind of logic is this!

Even more intolerable is that, in order to distort and defame China's image, Worvik goes so far as to absurdly compare China's condemnation of the awarding of the prize to the Dalai Lama with Hitler's opposition to a German receiving the Nobel Prize in 1935, saying that China's reaction is "very similar" to Hitler's reaction at that time, and that they are "in tune." His statement is obviously not due to his ignorance of history, but rather his malicious intent. Even elementary school textbooks clearly record that at that time, Hitler was crazily promoting fascism, persecuting the Jewish people, constantly creating incidents, and preparing to launch World War II. In that very year, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee awarded the peace prize to the German journalist Ossietzky, who opposed Nazi fascism, reflecting the will of the world's people to condemn Nazism and demonstrating the courage and conscience of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee at that time. Today, however, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee under Worvik's leadership has elevated a person who attempts to split the motherland and dreams of restoring the feudal serf system in Tibet, supporting and encouraging him. This is, of course, unacceptable to the Chinese people and international justice. Worvik forcibly links China with the infamous Hitler, intending only to smear China, but the result is that he himself is at a loss for words.

In defending the erroneous act of awarding the prize to the Dalai Lama, Worvik said that the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee did this "deliberately" to "actively influence" political issues through the award, and that awarding the prize to the Dalai Lama can be understood as support for the "leaders" who instigate unrest in China. This is an admission that awarding the prize to the Dalai Lama is a political plot by some people, aimed at destroying China's unity and attempting to overthrow the government of the People's Republic of China. Their actions are completely contrary to the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize to promote "friendship and harmony among nations" and to contribute to "peace," and are a disgrace to the reputation of the Nobel Prize. As the chairman, Mr. Worvik should feel ashamed of what he has done to the Nobel Peace Prize today, instead of having the nerve to say anything.

It should be especially noted that there are always some people in the international community who try every means to separate Tibet from China. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama by the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee and Worvik's unreasonable accusations against China only show that they are colluding with these international forces. Mr. Worvik should understand that trying to achieve his goals with such unpopular decisions and irresponsible statements is a miscalculation. In the end, he will only end up proving the truth of an old Chinese saying: "Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own foot."

　　沃尔维克的荒唐逻辑
　　冬明
    挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会公然将本年度诺贝尔和平奖授予长期从事分裂祖国活动的达赖。这种伤害中国人民感情、粗暴干涉中国内政的作法，理所当然地遭到中国人民和世界主持正义人士的谴责。但身为该委员会主席的沃尔维克，非但不对作出这种错误决定所造成的恶劣影响扪心自责，反而恼羞成怒，大放厥词，对中国进行谩骂攻击，态度极其蛮横无理。
    沃尔维克声称，中国人民对给达赖授奖一事的反应，是一个“不友好的举动”，中国在试图“铤而走险”。这完全是颠倒是非，倒打一耙。中国是一个由多民族组成的主权国家，西藏自古就是中国的神圣领土，这是举世公认的事实，世界上还没有哪个国家的政府认为西藏是一个“国家”。维护祖国的统一，实现各民族的和睦团结，是全中国各族人民的统一意志。挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会决定把和平奖授予达赖，这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是很不友好的行为。中国向诺贝尔和平奖委员会提出抗议，是任何一个主权国家的正当权利。沃尔维克却反诬中国进行义正词严的驳斥是“不友好的举动”，难道任凭你们明目张胆地纵容支持达赖的分裂主义行径，肆无忌惮地干涉中国的内政，才算“友好的举动”，这叫什么逻辑！
    更加不能容忍的是，为了歪曲丑化中国的形象，沃尔维克不惜荒谬地把中国谴责给达赖授奖，与1935年希特勒反对一位德国人获诺贝尔奖一事相提并论，说什么中国的反应同当年希特勒的反应“非常相似”，而且“合拍”。他这样说，显然不是由于他对历史知识的无知，而且用心险恶。连学生课本上都记载得清清楚楚，当时希特勒疯狂推行法西斯主义，迫害犹太民族，不断制造事端，加紧准备挑起二次世界大战。就在这一年，诺贝尔和平奖委员会把和平奖授予反对纳粹法西斯的德国新闻记者奥西耶茨基，体现了全世界人民谴责纳粹主义的意志，表明了当时的诺贝尔和平奖委员会的勇气和良知。今天，沃尔维克领导下的诺贝尔和平奖委员会却把一个企图分裂祖国、梦想在西藏复辟封建农奴制度的达赖捧上天，为他撑腰打气，这当然为中国人民和国际正义所不容。沃尔维克硬把中国同臭名昭著的希特勒生拉硬扯地连在一起，无非是想向中国身上泼污，其结果却恰恰说明他自己理屈词穷。
    沃尔维克在为授予达赖和平奖的错误行为辩解时说，挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会这样作是“有意识地”通过颁奖对政治问题“积极施加影响”，向达赖授奖“可以理解为”是对在中国挑动暴乱“领袖”们的支持。这就不打自招地供认，给达赖颁奖是某些人的一种政治图谋，是出于破坏中国的统一，企图颠覆中华人民共和国政府的“政治需要”。他们所作所为，完全与诺贝尔和平奖应促进“民族间的和睦亲善”和为“增进和平作出贡献”的宗旨背道而驰，是对诺贝尔奖声誉的玷污。身为主席的沃尔维克先生把如今的诺贝尔和平奖弄成这个样子，本该感到羞愧才是，还有什么脸出来说三道四？
    应当特别指出的是，国际上总有那么一些人，千方百计想把西藏从中国分裂出去。挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会给达赖颁奖以及沃尔维克对中国的无理指责，只能说明他们与国际上这股势力同流合污。沃尔维克先生应该明白，想靠那不得人心的决定和不负责任的讲话，来实现自己图谋是打错了算盘，到头来只能是应了中国的一句老话：搬起石头砸自己的脚。
