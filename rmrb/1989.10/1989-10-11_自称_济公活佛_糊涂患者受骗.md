Edition: 6

A man in his 30s named Guo Youshu from Beiluoping Village in Lashui County, Hebei Province, claimed at the beginning of last year to be the reincarnation of the Living Buddha Jigong, capable of dispelling disasters and curing illnesses. His "medical practice" involves extending one hand under the patient's armpit while chanting incomprehensible incantations, then using the other hand to produce a "magic pill" the size of a yellow bean. Deceived patients willingly offer him a few or even tens of yuan in cash, or gifts of alcohol and meat. The "Living Buddha Jigong's" trickery is not sophisticated, but his reputation has grown. The local government cannot simply stand by and do nothing.

    自称“济公活佛”　糊涂患者受骗
    河北涞水县北洛平村30多岁的郭有术，去年初自称是济公活佛转世，可以消灾祛病。他的“医术”是将一只手伸至患者腋下，口中念着谁也听不懂的咒语，然后用另一只手拿出一粒大如黄豆的“仙丹”。上当的患者自愿给他奉上几元、十几元香钱或酒肉等礼品。“活佛济公”的骗术并不高明，但却名声渐大，当地政府岂能听任不管。
