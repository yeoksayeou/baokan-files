Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan emphasized tonight that his visit to China was successful. He said that Thailand and China have close relations, with no problems in political relations, and that economic relations are developing.

Chatchai made the remarks upon his return to Bangkok International Airport late tonight after a two-day informal visit to China.

Chatchai said he met with four Chinese leaders—Li Peng, Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, and Deng Xiaoping—during his visit, discussing the Cambodian issue and bilateral relations. He said there were no major differences between Thailand and China on the Cambodian issue. Both countries agree that Vietnam should withdraw all its troops from Cambodia and that a four-party coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk should be established.

He said the Chinese side agreed to discuss the establishment of an international supervisory body and to determine its membership and tasks.

In response to a reporter's question, Chatchai pointed out that the establishment of an international supervisory body is part of a "comprehensive solution" to the Cambodian issue. However, he could not confirm when the meeting would be held, saying, "It's not something that can be determined in one day; it will take some time."

　　差猜总理返抵曼谷时说
　　访华取得成功
    新华社曼谷10月26日电　（记者黄勇、邵林铭）泰国总理差猜·春哈旺今晚在这里强调说，他这次访华取得了成功。泰中两国关系密切，政治关系没有问题，经济关系正在发展。
    差猜是在结束对中国的两天非正式访问于今天深夜回到曼谷国际机场时对记者讲这番话的。
    差猜说，访问期间，他先后会见了李鹏、江泽民、杨尚昆、邓小平四位中国领导人，讨论了柬埔寨问题和双边关系。他说，在柬埔寨问题上泰中两国没有什么分歧。泰中两国一致认为：越南应从柬埔寨全部撤军；建立以西哈努克亲王为首的柬埔寨四方联合政府。
    他说，中国方面同意讨论建立国际监督机构的问题，并确定该机构的成员和任务。
    差猜在回答记者的问题时指出，建立国际监督机构是“全面解决”柬埔寨问题的一部分。但他不能肯定上述会议何时举行，只是说“不是一天可以确定的事，要花些时间”。
