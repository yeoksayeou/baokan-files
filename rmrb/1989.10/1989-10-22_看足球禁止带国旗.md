    Banning Flags at Football Matches
    In today's Britain, violent incidents on the football field are not uncommon. After five criminologists conducted an in-depth investigation into 11 football tragedies that have occurred in recent years, they confirmed that the trigger for the chaos and disturbances was the British flag. It turns out that "football hooligans" often take advantage of the moment when fans are emotionally charged and unable to control themselves, waving large British "Union Jack" flags. This is like adding fuel to the fire, making fans even more uncontrollable, ultimately leading to violent acts in their impulsiveness...

    Based on this conclusion, the British police recently issued a regulation: please do not bring flags or banners longer than 2 feet to the match. Those who violate this rule will be expelled from the stadium.

    Experts estimate that this ban could reduce the number of "bloody tragedies" on the football field by at least half.

　　看足球禁止带国旗
    在今日英国，绿茵场上的“暴力事件”时有发生。5名犯罪学家在对11起近年来发生的“足球悲剧”进行深入调查后证实，引发混乱和骚动的“导火线”却是英国国旗——原来，“足球流氓”们常常趁球迷感情激动得不能“自己”之时挥动巨大的英国“米”字旗，这无异于火上加油，促使球迷们行动更加难以自控，最后在冲动中干出暴力行为……据此结论，英国警方前不久作出规定：请球迷们观赛勿带长度超过2英尺的国旗或横标，违者将被逐出球场。
    专家们估计，此禁令可望使绿茵场上的“流血悲剧”起码减少一半。　长风　编译
