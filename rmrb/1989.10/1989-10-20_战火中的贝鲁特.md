According to the American newspaper *Pacific Stars and Stripes*

The half-year-long Lebanese shelling shows no signs of ending. Under the ravages of the shelling, the once vibrant and bustling Lebanese capital, Beirut, is now desolate and empty. 90% of Beirut's residents have fled to other places, while those who remain are helpless, struggling to survive in a state of hardship and terror.

A young woman named Salwa Ashkar, who runs a beauty salon in the Christian-controlled eastern part of Beirut, said, "We live like rats underground, hiding day and night without rest, trembling with fear. We can't take any more blows." On the other side of the green dividing line in the capital, under the bright moonlight, groups of snipers lurk among the destroyed apartment buildings. The city is without water or electricity, and hospitals lack doctors and medicine. The presidential palace atop the Christian district of Baabda, like other buildings, has been reduced to rubble by shelling.

The streets are littered with broken bricks and debris, and power lines hang from utility poles knocked over by shells. About 150,000 Beirut residents huddle in underground shelters or parking garages, sustaining life with meager food, hoping the war will end soon. In the apartments, residents crowd the entrances on the lower floors, cooking simple meals over makeshift stoves. During lulls in the shelling, men risk going out to find anything that can be burned, while women stay home, preparing the next meal, hoping their men return safely.

In the Muslim western part of Beirut, whenever the shelling eases, people emerge from their shelters, climb into cars, and flee south with whatever they can carry. Some find refuge with relatives or friends, while tens of thousands have no choice but to camp along the coastal highway. They either hide in cars or sleep under plastic tarps. They listen to the cannon fire from the north with a mixture of despair and hope. In eastern Beirut, Christians are not so fortunate. Their only escape route is by sea, crossing the blockade to Cyprus by boat. A Christian couple recently attempted to flee on the speedboat "Saint Mary" and were hit by shelling, losing their two daughters.

Fuel is extremely scarce in the besieged eastern Beirut. Long lines form in front of the liquefied gas stations. Each gas cylinder costs $21, compared to just $1 in peacetime. Hamra Street, the main commercial area of Beirut, was once bustling with activity. Now it is riddled with bullet holes and lifeless, with only a few small restaurants operating during lulls in the shelling, but few customers dare to eat there for fear of being hit by shells. Banks and businesses are closed. Government agencies are dysfunctional. No one receives a salary. Schools have been closed for months.

It seems that after 15 years of war, the desperate residents of Beirut will not see the light of peace in the near future.

### 战火中的贝鲁特

    战火中的贝鲁特
    持续了半年的黎巴嫩炮战仍然毫无结束的迹象。在炮战的蹂躏之下，曾经生机勃勃、热闹非常的黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特，如今已空空荡荡，满目凄凉。90％的贝鲁特居民已经流浪他乡，留下来的人束手无策，在艰难慌恐中度日。
    一位在基督徒控制的贝鲁特东区开办美容厅的青年妇女萨尔瓦·阿什卡尔说：“我们像老鼠一样生活在地下，日夜无休止地躲藏在掩体内，胆战心惊。我们经不起更多的打击了。”在首都绿色分界线的另一边，月光明亮，一群群狙击手出没于被破坏的公寓之中。市内无水无电，医院缺医少药。坐落于巴卜达基督徒区山顶之上的总统宫殿，同其它建筑物一样，已被炮弹击成瓦砾。
    大街上，遍地破砖碎瓦，被炮弹打得东倒西歪的电杆上挂着被击断的电线。大约有15万贝鲁特居民畏缩在地下掩体或地下停车场，靠仅有的一点食物维持生命，日夜期待尽快结束战争。公寓里，居住者拥挤在楼房底层的门口，用临时火炉做简单的饭菜，炮击间歇时，男人冒险出去寻找任何可以燃烧的东西，女人在家拼凑下顿饭菜，盼望男人平安归来。
    在西贝鲁特穆斯林区，一旦炮击有所缓和，人们便钻出掩体，爬上汽车，带着能够携带的一切东西向南逃奔。一些人在亲戚朋友家避难，而成千上万的人则不得不在海岸公路沿线风餐露宿。他们或躲在汽车里，或躺在塑料篷下面睡觉。他们在公路旁，寒心而又侥幸地听着北面传来的炮声。在东贝鲁特，基督徒们还没有如此幸运。他们唯一的出路是从海上越过封锁，乘船逃往塞浦路斯。一对基督徒夫妻在最近一个夜里乘快艇“圣玛丽娅”号潜逃时，快艇被炮弹击中，两个女儿被夺去生命。
    被封锁的东贝鲁特的燃料十分短缺。液化气站前面排着买煤气罐的长队。每罐煤气售价21美元，而在过去和平时期只卖1美元。贝鲁特市哈姆拉大街是市内的主要商业区，过去车水马龙，一派繁忙景象，如今弹痕累累，死气沉沉，只有几家小餐馆在炮击间歇时才临时营业，但很少有人光顾，人们担心在那里吃饭时一下子成为炮灰。市内的银行、商行均已关闭。政府机构已丧失作用。没有人能领到工资。学校已被关闭好几个月。
    看来，经历了15年战乱而深感绝望的贝鲁特居民短期内很难盼来和平生活的曙光。
