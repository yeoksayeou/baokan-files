A major disaster suddenly struck the western United States today, as the San Francisco-Oakland region experienced a powerful earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale. This is the second-largest earthquake to hit the American mainland this century, following the infamous 8.6 magnitude earthquake that struck San Francisco in 1906.

As of the time of this report, preliminary figures indicate that more than 270 people have died, with economic losses estimated at $1 billion. Additionally, several million residents are without electricity, computers are inoperable, traffic is severely congested, and normal work and life have been disrupted. Rescue and relief efforts are currently underway.

According to measurements, the epicenter was located 16 kilometers north of Santa Cruz on the Pacific coast. The earthquake affected a large portion of California, from San Francisco to Sacramento.

At 5:04 PM (Pacific Time) on October 17, just as traffic was at its peak, the ground suddenly shook. Traffic lights went out, cars swayed uncontrollably, and accidents immediately resulted in 50 deaths, with numerous vehicles stranded on the roads. A 10-meter section of the Bay Bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland collapsed, and a 2-kilometer stretch of Highway 88 in Oakland sank.

The earthquake severed transportation links, damaged San Francisco International Airport, and forced the closure of highways, bridges, airports, and the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. High-rise buildings in San Francisco and its vicinity swayed, and glass shards scattered everywhere. A large building in the Bay Area collapsed. Several fires broke out in the city, with a major blaze engulfing the Marina District. Water pipes were damaged, hindering firefighting efforts.

At the time of the earthquake, the "Candlestick Park" in San Francisco was hosting the third game of the World Series. The stadium shook for 15 seconds but sustained no major damage. The 62,000 spectators celebrated their escape from disaster.

The news reached Washington, where President Bush was attending a dinner with Republican governors. He told reporters that the federal government would do everything possible to aid in the relief efforts. The White House is closely monitoring the situation, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has established a command center.

    本报华盛顿10月17日电　记者张启昕报道：今天，一场重大灾难突然降临美国西部，旧金山—奥克兰地区又一次发生了强烈地震，震级为里氏6.9级。这是本世纪美国大陆经历的第二次最大地震，仅次于1906年闻名全球的旧金山8.6级大地震。
    截止发稿时，初步统计地震中死亡人数超过270人，经济损失估计10亿美元。另外，几百万居民缺电，计算机不能运转，交通阻塞严重，影响正常工作和生活。目前救灾正在进行。
    据测定，震中位于太平洋边缘的圣克鲁斯以北16公里。地震波及加利福尼亚州从旧金山到萨克拉门托的大部地区。
    17日下午5时零4分（美国西部时间），正当交通拥挤时刻，大地突然震动，交通信号灯顿时熄灭，行车东摇西晃，不由自主，交通事故当即造成50人死亡，大量汽车被困路中。连接旧金山和奥克兰的海湾大桥10米长的桥面倒塌，奥克兰88号公路约2公里的路段下陷。
    地震切断了交通，损害了旧金山国际机场。公路、桥梁、机场、海湾快速铁路一时被迫关闭。旧金山及其附近地区，高楼大厦左右摇动，玻璃碎片四处落散。海湾地区一座大厦倒坍。市内几处起火，马里纳区大火熊熊燃烧。自来水管遭损害，救火工作受阻。
    地震发生时，旧金山“烛台”公园球场正在举行第三届棒球比赛。场地震动15秒后，无大损坏。6.2万名观众庆贺幸免灾难。
    消息传到首都华盛顿，布什总统正在参加共和党州长的晚宴。他对记者们说，联邦政府将尽一切努力进行救灾。白宫正在密切监视灾情，联邦紧急情况总部已设立指挥中心。
