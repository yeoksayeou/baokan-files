Over the past 20 years, African Americans have made some progress in their struggle for civil rights, with improvements in their social status and economic conditions. However, overall, they have not truly escaped the shackles of racial discrimination. In the United States, the vast majority of African Americans still live in poverty.

According to the "Blacks and American Society" survey report published in July of this year, the current poverty rate among African Americans is 2 to 3 times that of whites; the unemployment rate is twice that of whites. African Americans face significant disparities with whites in employment, education, healthcare, and housing. In the late 1960s, 40% of African American children lived in poverty, but by the mid-1980s, this figure had risen to 46%, far exceeding the proportion of white children in similar circumstances. In the United States, single-parent households are common, and the proportion of African American children living in such households reaches 86%. In the 1970s, 39% of African Americans who graduated from high school went on to college, but in the 1980s, this figure dropped to 38%. According to statistics, the number of African Americans living in poverty this year exceeds 9.7 million.

High unemployment rates and low educational attainment contribute to social disorder among African Americans, with violence, murder, drug abuse, and serious crimes plaguing the entire African American community. Some American sociologists believe that the plight of African Americans is due to differences in values, aspirations, and behavior between African Americans and whites. In reality, racial discrimination is the true cause of African American poverty. Although the U.S. government claims that "race is not an issue in America," the so-called "racial harmony" is merely a legal fiction. Today, overt violence against African Americans is less common, but "benevolent racism" is ubiquitous. In other words, regardless of your status or wealth, if your skin is black, you will still face cold shoulders and neglect.

This year, the U.S. Supreme Court has made a series of rulings that weaken the rights of African Americans, drawing strong opposition from the African American community. The facts show that the United States is not a "color-blind society," and discrimination against African Americans still exists.

    美国黑人仍然受歧视
    贾光伟
    20年来，美国黑人争取民权的斗争取得一定的胜利，黑人的社会地位有所提高，经济状况有所好转。但是，从整体上看，黑人并未真正摆脱种族歧视的束缚。在美国，绝大多数黑人依然生活在贫困之中。
    据今年7月发表的《黑人与美国社会》调查报告统计，目前，黑人贫困率是白人的2至3倍；失业率是白人的2倍；黑人在就业、受教育程度、医疗保险、住房等方面与白人存在着明显差距。60年代末期，40％的黑人儿童生活在贫困之中，而到80年代中期，这一数字上升为46％，大大高于同样情况的白人儿童。在美国，单亲家庭比较普遍，生活在这种家庭中的黑人儿童比例则高达86％。70年代，黑人高中毕业后升入大学的为39％，80年代降为38％。据统计，今年黑人贫困人数超过970万。
    高失业率与低教育程度使黑人社会很乱，暴力、凶杀、吸毒、恶性犯罪困扰着整个黑人社会。美国一些社会学家认为，黑人境况得不到改善是由于黑人在价值观、抱负以及行为表现上与白人有差异。实际上，种族歧视才是黑人贫困的真正原因，尽管美国政府宣称“种族在美国不成为问题”，但所谓“种族和谐”不过是美国法律条文上的虚相。现在，公开伤害黑人的暴力行为已不多见了，但“温和的种族主义”却无处不在。就是说，不管你的地位多高，多么富有，只要皮肤是黑的，就会受到冷遇和怠慢。
    今年以来，美国最高法院又作出一系列削弱黑人权益的裁决，遭到黑人强烈反对。事实表明，美国并非是一个“色盲的社会”，对黑人的歧视依然存在。
