The mining industry has achieved remarkable results over the past 40 years. Wen Jiabao, a member of the Central Secretariat, and Song Jian, a member of the State Council, visited the China Geological Museum this evening to enthusiastically view an exhibition showcasing the achievements of the mining industry since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Minister of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, Zhu Xun, introduced the achievements of China's mining industry over the past 40 years to the visitors. A professional and technically comprehensive geological team has been formed, capable of working on land, at sea, and in the air. The team has discovered 162 types of minerals, with 148 types having confirmed reserves. More than 20 types of minerals have reserves ranking among the world's top. The total amount of underground water resources in China has been identified, and a number of underground water sources have been discovered for large-scale arid regions and important national construction projects. Chinese geologists have also provided reliable geological data for major engineering projects such as the Gezhouba Water Conservancy Project and the Yangtze River Bridge, as well as for urban construction. They have also made effective contributions to the monitoring and comprehensive treatment of geological disasters such as earthquakes.

Wen Jiabao and Song Jian praised the achievements made by the geologists through their down-to-earth and arduous efforts. Relevant department heads, including Yuan Baohua, Yu Hong'en, Wang Tao, Lin Hanxiong, and Gu Xiulian, also visited the exhibition.
