The efforts to combat pornography in the coastal provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hainan have shown initial results. A large number of pornographic books, periodicals, and audio-visual products have been seized, and many sales points specializing in pornographic publications have been shut down. Underground networks and publishing houses, printing plants involved in the production and trafficking of pornographic materials have been uncovered and dealt with.

On September 10 and 11, Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, went to Guangzhou to preside over a meeting on the anti-pornography campaign in the four coastal provinces. After that, party and government leaders in the four provinces took charge and made specific arrangements for the campaign. Chen Guangyi, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, and Jia Qinglin, Deputy Secretary, went to Shishi City, where pornographic videotapes were rampant, to inspect the progress of the anti-pornography campaign. Xu Shijie, Secretary of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee, and Liu Jianfeng, Governor, spoke at a provincial anti-pornography work conference, making unified arrangements. In early September, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government sent four work teams to Wenzhou, Taizhou, Lishui, Jinhua, Jiaxing, and Huzhou to inspect and supervise the anti-pornography campaign. On September 21, the President of the Provincial High Court led 24 officials from relevant departments to Wenzhou to assist in the work. To cooperate with the investigation of criminal activities involving the postal and telecommunications system, the Director of the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration also went to Wenzhou. Later, Li Zemin, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, also went to Wenzhou to inspect and guide the anti-pornography struggle. In Guangdong Province, Zhu Senlin, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, Zhang Hanqing, Deputy Secretary, and Li Lanfang, Deputy Mayor, went to the streets several times to personally inspect the cleaning and rectification sites; Zhanjiang City, led by Yu Qizhi, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, conducted two large-scale inspections of the entire city; counties such as Luhefeng, Haifeng, Chaoyang, and Huizhou, where pornographic materials were rampant, were led by county party secretaries or county magistrates to conduct multiple inspections of book, periodical, and audio-visual markets.

The four coastal provinces have clarified their respective anti-pornography work priorities based on their specific situations. Fujian concentrated the forces of provincial, municipal, and township-level cadres to inspect Shishi City. Zhehou focused on Wenzhou as the key area for anti-pornography efforts, with departments such as industry and commerce, culture, public security, procuratorate, courts, postal and telecommunications, and banks working together to quickly open up the situation in Wenzhou. So far, Wenzhou has identified 15 major cases and is speeding up the trial process. Cangnan County alone has uncovered 31 cases of "trafficking in pornography" with amounts over 10,000 yuan. The counties of Leqing, Cangnan, and Lukou have held sentencing meetings, publicly handling a batch of typical cases, and some criminals have been sentenced to imprisonment, deterring lawbreakers, with 59 people surrendering to the judicial authorities. In the relatively open Guangdong Province, the focus is on blocking foreign pornographic publications, setting up three lines of defense. The first line is responsible by the customs, border defense, and fishery administration departments, with sea patrols, port blockades, and border line inspections, and strengthening the anti-smuggling forces at sea and ports, improving equipment to enhance anti-smuggling capabilities and seizure rates. The second line is responsible by the anti-smuggling stations and teams along the coast to the interior and key transportation routes, as well as the transportation and postal departments, for the interception and inspection of trafficking and dissemination routes. The third line is the land-based anti-pornography campaign, focusing on the excavation of underground dens producing and selling pornographic books, videotapes, and pornographic playing cards. Hainan Province pays attention to combining the anti-pornography campaign with the fight against social evils, and while confiscating banned books and videotapes, it resolutely investigates and deals with prostitution and brothel cases, and shuts down sex dens.

At present, the book, periodical, and audio-visual markets in the four coastal provinces have undergone significant changes. In the past two months, Fujian Province has mobilized 25,924 personnel to seize 257,819 banned books, 7,191 obscene paintings, 3,342 sets of nude playing cards, 90,000 videotapes, nearly 40,000 audio tapes, shut down 802 illegal stalls, and legally prosecuted 2,029 lawbreakers. Since early April this year, Guangdong Province has mobilized 39,853 personnel to seize 345,870 various banned books, 40,125 obscene albums, 26,018 sets of obscene playing cards, 69,000 illegal obscene videotapes, and also seized 1,200 various tools for making cases, and legally prosecuted 2,868 lawbreakers. Since July this year, Zhejiang Province has mobilized 33,286 personnel to seize 89,630 banned books, 24,939 illegal publications, 69,576 illegal and obscene videotapes, 40,661 audio tapes, and shut down a number of book wholesalers, retail stalls, and video distribution and screening points, and legally prosecuted 368 lawbreakers. This year, Hainan Province has seized 21,785 banned books and 2,828 videotapes, and shut down 21 unlicensed bookstores.

    党政负责人挂帅  查大案堵“黄源”
    沿海四省深入开展“扫黄”
    书报刊及音像市场面貌有了较大改观
    本报讯　对于淫秽出版物屡禁不止的广东、福建、浙江、海南四省，“扫黄”工作已初见成效。大批黄色书刊和音像制品被查禁，一些专门兜售淫秽出版物的销售点被取缔，一些制黄、贩黄的地下网络和出版社、印刷厂被破获和查处。
    9月10日、11日，中共中央政治局常委李瑞环南下广州亲自主持召开了沿海四省“扫黄”工作座谈会。在这以后，四省党政负责同志挂帅，做出“扫黄”具体部署。福建省委书记陈光毅、副书记贾庆林赶赴黄色录像带泛滥的石狮市，检查“扫黄”进展情况。海南省委书记许士杰、省长刘剑锋在全省“扫黄”工作会议上讲话，进行统一部署。浙江省委、省政府于9月初分四路派出工作组，到温州、台州、丽水、金华、嘉兴、湖州等地市检查督促“扫黄”。9月21日，省法院院长带领有关部门24名干部再次到温州帮助工作。为配合查清邮电系统勾结犯罪的活动，省邮电管理局长也专程赴温州。之后，省委书记李泽民也去温州检查指导“扫黄”斗争。在广东省，广州市委书记朱森林、副书记张汉青、副市长李兰芳多次上街，亲临清查整顿现场；湛江市在市委副书记余启志带领下，两次对全市进行大规模清查；淫秽物品泛滥比较严重的陆丰、海丰、潮阳、惠东等县，由县委书记或县长亲自带领清查队伍，连续多次清查书报刊和音像市场。
    沿海四省针对本省的具体情况，明确各自的“扫黄”工作重点。福建集中省、市、镇三级干部力量清查石狮市。浙江把温州地区作为“扫黄”的重点地区，工商、文化、公检法、邮电、银行等单位形成一股合力，使温州地区的“扫黄”迅速打开局面。目前，温州已排出15个重大案件，正在加快审理。仅苍南县就查获“贩黄”金额万元以上的案件31起。乐清、苍南、鹿城三县区分别召开宣判大会，大张旗鼓地公开处理了一批典型案件，一些犯罪分子被判徒刑，震慑了不法分子，有59人到政法部门自首。在开放程度较高的广东省，则把堵截境外淫秽出版物作为重点，设立了三道防线。第一线由海关、边防、渔政部门负责，海上抓、口岸堵、边防沿线查缉，并且充实海上和口岸的缉私力量，改进装备，以提高缉私能力和查获率。第二线由沿海通往内地和交通要道上的工商缉私站、缉私队以及交通、邮政等部门，负责交通干线及邮路等贩运、扩散道的缉拿和检查。第三线是陆上的“扫黄”，重点放在深挖制作、贩卖淫秽书刊、录像带、淫秽扑克的地下窝点。海南省则注意把“扫黄”与打击社会丑恶现象结合起来，在收缴违禁书刊和录像带的同时，坚决查处卖淫、嫖宿案件、取缔色情窝点。
    目前沿海四省的书报刊及音像市场有了较大的改观。福建省两个多月来共出动25924人次，查获违禁书刊257819册、淫画7191张、裸体扑克3342副、录像带9万多盒、录音带近4万盒，取缔各种违法摊点802家，依法审理违法犯罪分子2029人。广东省自今年4月初以来，共出动清查力量39853人次，收缴各类违禁书刊345870册、淫秽画册40125本、淫秽扑克26018副，收缴非法淫秽录像带69000多盒，同时收缴录像机、电视机、倒带机等各种做案工具1200多台件，共依法审理违法犯罪分子2868人。浙江省自今年7月以来，出动检查人员33286人次，查缴违禁书刊89630册、非法出版物24939册，查缴非法、淫秽录像带69576盒、录音带40661盒，还取缔了一批书刊批发点、零售摊点以及录像发行站和放映点，依法审理违法犯罪分子368人。海南省今年以来收缴违禁书刊21785册、录像带2828盒，取缔无照经营书刊点21个。
