    Dedication in September
    Xiao Qiao

    Dedication: We are daughters of the September sun, born to rebel against darkness.
    A poem by Zhao Zhixuan, September 18, 1939.

    I dedicate this book in September, dedicating "Daughters of the September Sun."
    Born in September, died in September, hence she is called the daughter of the September sun.
    Moreover, September determined her fate: brightness, passion, abundance. Though there were storms and rains, she never changed her heart of pursuing the sun.
    This is the daughter of the September sun: Zhao Zhixuan.

    I heard this name from Uncle Chen Bocun. I met Uncle Chen Bocun at Aunt Yuan's place. When he shook my hand, he naturally asked whose child I was, and as usual, we started talking about mothers and aunts. Later, when Aunt Yuan mentioned that Chen Bocun's wife was a remarkable female comrade, I also thought it was an old story. "You should remember this name: Zhao Zhixuan. If she were alive, she would be far better than all of you. Nowadays, female cadres, including males, are rarely like her..." I cannot say Aunt Yuan is like the old lady in "The Old Tales of Nine Kilos," she is the soulmate of my spirit, and one day I will write her story.

    After returning to Beijing, Uncle Chen personally came to visit me. As soon as I opened the door, I knew this. Like ordinary visitors, he brought a package of materials, suggesting that I write a book from them. This is Aunt Zhixuan's diary, letters, and recordings, a heavy package. I took it, feeling overwhelmed. Before finding me, he had already found several writers, and after finding me, I recommended several more. This package of materials was like a hot potato, no one dared to take it, and no one dared to throw it away. People passed it down one by one, day by day, and I even dared not open it. The reason is simple: Uncle Chen's love for Aunt Zhixuan, this is the fire, this fire is untouchable. A man who loves his wife so deeply has already excluded any writer, even any words. No one can recreate the image in his heart, not even he himself. Who is Zhao Zhixuan? A female cadre, a female Party member, a female intellectual. Indeed, writing about women is quite fashionable, but it depends on what kind of woman: a great person? A beauty? A noble lady? But Zhao Zhixuan is none of these. In the literary fashion of that time, this is very difficult.

    It was not until Uncle Chen fell ill that I suddenly realized my possible irreparable mistake, so I retrieved the package of materials. I opened it on the carpet and spread it out overnight, truly vast.

    First, I picked out Aunt Zhixuan's half-written autobiography "The Road" to read. Just the subtitles made my heart beat wildly—"Chapter 1, My Home is on the Songhua River in Northeast China..."—so beautiful, so true, so serene. This is her last will. An old lady in the late stage of cancer, knowing that she would not live long, took advantage of the quiet night to crawl out of bed and write on a piece of white paper, word by word, to the world, confessing her even whiter life. Without resentment, without grievance, she, who had seen the spring colors of the world, was like a snow peak that transcended worldly sufferings, opening her heart, turning her life into a vast and magnificent one, into a trickle, and telling it softly.

    "The Road" stopped abruptly at "September 18," with half a song unsung, Zhao Zhixuan's heart stopped beating. In her life, she died, and when she completed her transformation of life view, she completed her life. When the September sun shines on the world, the daughter of the September sun, chasing the sun, ascends to the sky.

    Comrade Huang Hua excitedly wrote a preface for "The Road." This "Road" has a beginning but no end. The author, though dead, is still alive.

    All the texts in this collection are her own: diaries, letters, poems, and speeches. In fact, it is a collection of Zhao Zhixuan's works.

    Thanks to the support of the factory and organization where Comrade Zhao Zhixuan once worked, this collection was able to be published. It is rare that they can remember a factory director who is not prominent for so long, and it is rare that Aunt Zhixuan can dedicate her life to such a people. Just for this, it is enough to make Aunt Zhixuan smile in her grave.

    九月的奉献
    小乔
    题记：我们是九月太阳的女儿，生来就和黑暗反叛。
    赵志萱诗1939.9.18．
    我在九月奉献此书，奉献《九月太阳的女儿》。
    生于九月，死于九月，因此叫她九月太阳的女儿。
    更因为九月决定了她一生的命运：光明、火热、丰饶，纵有风风雨雨，却不改追逐太阳之心。
    这就是九月太阳的女儿：赵志萱。
    这个名字是我从陈伯村伯伯那里听到的。陈伯村伯伯是我在袁妈妈那里认识的，握住我的手时自然而然地问起这是谁家的孩子，于是照例又从婆婆妈妈谈起。而当袁妈妈过后谈到陈伯村的夫人是个了不起的女同志时，我也认为是老生常谈。“你应该记住这个名字：赵志萱。她要是活着，比你们不知要强多少倍呢。现在的女干部，包括男的，很少有她这样的了……”不能说袁妈妈是九斤老太，她是我灵魂的知音，早晚有一天我要写出她的故事。
    回到北京后陈伯伯就亲自登门拜访了。一开门我就知道了这一点，像那些平凡的来访者一样，他带来了一包素材，建议由我来写成一本书。这是志萱阿姨的日记、书信、录音，重重的一大包。我接过来，顿感吃不消。在找到我之前，他已找了几个作家，在找到我之后，我又推荐了几个作家。这包材料象是一包烫手的火，谁也不敢接过来，谁也不敢扔掉它。人们一个一个往下传，一天一天往后拖，我甚至不敢开启它，原因很简单：陈伯伯对志萱阿姨的爱，这就是那火，这火是动不得的，一个对妻子怀有如此深厚爱情的人，已经排斥了任何作家，甚至排斥了任何文字，没有人能重塑他心目中的那个形象，甚至他自己也不能。赵志萱，何许人也？一个女干部、一个女党员、一个女知识分子。不错，写女人是挺时髦的，但要看是什么女人：伟人？美人？贵夫人？但赵志萱都不是，在当时的文学风尚中，这就很难办。
    直到陈伯伯也病倒了，我才幡然悔悟，意识到自己可能犯下不可弥补的过失，于是将那包材料追回，就在地毯上打开了包，连夜铺排开来，真可谓浩瀚。
      先把志萱阿姨写了一半的自传《道路》拣出来看，光是那小标题已使我的心怦然而动——“第一章，我的家在东北松花江上……”——好美，好真，好沉静。这是她生命的绝笔。一个老太太在癌症的晚期，自知不久于人世，趁着夜深人静从病床上爬起来，在洁白的纸上一笔一划地向世人交代自己更为洁白的一生，没有悲愤，没有幽怨，阅尽人间春色的她，像一座超越世俗苦难的雪峰一样，畅开自己的情怀，将自己波澜壮阔的一生，化作涓涓细流，娓娓道来。
    《道路》写到“九·一八”戛然而止，噙着半支没有唱完的歌儿，赵志萱的心脏停止了跳动。在她生的日子里，她死去了，在她完成人生观转变的时候，她完成了人生。在九月太阳普照人间的时候，九月太阳的女儿，追逐太阳飞升而去。
    黄华同志激动地为《道路》作序，这“道路”有头无尾，这作者虽死犹生。
    收到这个集子里的全是她自己的文字：日记、书信、诗文，还有讲话。实际上是一本赵志萱文集。
    感谢赵志萱同志曾任职的工厂和机关的支持，这本集子才得以问世。难得他们能这样长久地记住一个并不显赫的女厂长，难得志萱阿姨能为这样的人民大众贡献一生，仅此一点，足使志萱含笑九泉。
