On July 11th, just as dawn broke, a ten-seater car sped from Tianjin towards Shandong's Changdao Island. The people inside the car, weary from days of investigation, had to arrive before a suspect who was transferring illicit funds...

	**Reports Pour In**

Early this year, after verification by the Tianjin Paper Company's disciplinary committee, it was found that a factory director had sold a borrowed car to an individual, pocketing 60,000 yuan into a secret fund, severely violating financial discipline. The company's party committee immediately dismissed him and issued a notice.

How could a factory director dare to do such a thing? Workers, who had long been discontented with various corrupt practices, began to report them. But from the start, they encountered tough nuts to crack: the deputy head of the processing paper experimental factory's workshop, Yu, was reported for accepting 4,700 yuan in bribes. When questioned, he flew into a rage: "Cut it out! Can you provide evidence?"

"The tougher they are, the harder we hit!" After carefully studying the detailed report that clearly stated the time, place, and circumstances, the company's party secretary, Li Linxiang, decided to request the River West District Procuratorate to gather evidence. After obtaining the evidence and arresting Yu, he was shocked and confessed, implicating a string of embezzlers and bribe-takers. New reports poured in...

Tianjin Paper Company is a large enterprise with over 23,000 employees and 24 subsidiaries. Some people worried, "Will this make the company's image of being an advanced unit look ugly?" Others said, "This will offend a lot of people, even hurt some..."

Strangely, when it came to talking about fighting corruption, everyone was indignant, but when it came to looking at themselves, some people started to hesitate and murmur.

	**Command with Precision**

Party Secretary Li Linxiang entered deep thought.

Why fear this and fear that, but not fear the life and death of the Party and the country? Li Linxiang steeled himself and strengthened others. The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session on resolutely punishing corruption made people wake up. The company's party committee decided to treat the fight against corruption as a major task, sending teams to explain policies, laws, gather evidence, and win hearts...

Fighting corruption indeed requires concentrated effort, neither can it be a big, noisy campaign, nor can it be a superficial show. The paper company and the River West District Procuratorate worked closely together, using facts as the basis and laws as the standard. For one factory's seven cases, both sides sent 17 people to 13 provinces and cities to gather evidence. A deputy manager had two nights of talks with a factory-level cadre.

Commanding this work required meticulous attention to detail. For those who reported and exposed, they kept it confidential; for those who confessed, they showed leniency. Every piece of evidence was repeatedly verified. By August this year, they had recovered 180,000 yuan for the state.

	**Fighting Corruption Strengthens Cohesion**

When all the company's employees saw that the leadership was serious about fighting corruption, their spirits were boosted. Facing difficulties such as tight funds and rising raw material prices, everyone pooled their strengths to overcome challenges. Halfway through the production period, half of the tasks were completed, and the momentum was good. A factory-level cadre who handed over several thousand yuan in illicit funds was treated leniently and, filled with remorse, worked overtime to complete a major trial production task.

The cadres fighting on the front lines of the anti-corruption campaign showed a strong sense of responsibility. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, some of them fainted and hit their heads, requiring three stitches but continued to work; some had their mothers pass away, only returning home after completing their tasks; some, unable to adapt to the local environment and suffering from heatstroke, vomited multiple times but still worked day and night...

All this made Li Linxiang feel that most of our cadres are good, and our workers are also good. As long as the leadership is resolute and seriously carries out the fight against corruption, it can enhance the cohesion of the masses and make people genuinely rally around the Party!

　　一丝不苟
　　——记天津造纸公司的反腐败
　　本报记者　肖荻
    七月十一日，天刚破晓。一辆十人轿车从天津驶出，急奔山东长岛。车上的几个人带着连日办案的疲劳，必须赶在一名转移赃款者的前边突破案情……
          举报纷至沓来
    今年初，经天津造纸公司纪委核实：一厂长将借用的小轿车卖给个体户，收六万元纳入小金库，严重违犯财经纪律。公司党委断然给以撤职处分并发出通报。
    怎么，厂长也敢动？早就对各种腐败现象不满的职工们，纷纷举报。但一上来就是一堆硬骨头：加工纸实验厂一车间副主任鞠某，被举报受贿四千七百元，被查询时居然大怒：“少来这一套！你们能拿出证据吗？”“越硬越要碰！”详细研究了对时间、地点和情节写得一清二楚的举报信后，公司党委书记李林祥决定商请河西区检察院取证。经取证并收审后，鞠大惊失色，如实招供，又交代出一串贪污、受贿人，新的举报也纷至沓来……
    天津造纸公司是个大单位，职工就有二万三千多人，下属单位有二十四个。一些人担心地问：“这样搞下去，公司先进单位的形象会不会丑陋不堪？”还有人说：“这要得罪好多人，甚至要伤害一些人……”
    事情就是这么怪。谈起反腐败，人们无不义愤填膺，但一转为瞧自己的时候，一些投鼠忌器的嘁嘁嚓嚓却悄然而起。
    指挥心细如发
    党委书记李林祥进入深沉的思索。
    怕这怕那，为什么就不怕党和国家的生死存亡？李林祥砥砺自己，坚定他人。四中全会决议有关坚决惩治腐败的指示更加使人猛醒。公司党委决定把反腐败当作一件大事来抓，分头下去讲政策、讲法律、查证、攻心……
    反腐败，的确要聚精会神去干，既不能大轰大嗡搞“运动”，又不能虎头蛇尾走过场。造纸公司与河西区检察院密切协作，以事实为根据，以法律为准绳，对下属一个厂七个案件，双方抽出十七人分赴十三个省市取证。副经理对一个厂级干部谈话两夜。
    指挥这项工作，更需心细如发。对举报检举的，他们予以保密；对坦白交待的，他们给予宽大。每一份证据，他们反复核对。到今年八月，他们为国家追回赃款达十八万元。
    反腐败增强了向心力
    当全公司职工看到领导反腐败确是动真的、碰硬的、干实的，情绪振奋。在资金紧缺、原材料涨价等诸多困难面前，大家群策群力攻坚克难关，生产时间过半任务过半，势头良好。一位交出数千元赃款的厂级干部受到宽大处理后，悔恨交加，加班工作，完成一项重大试制任务。
    奋战在反腐败第一线的干部，更表现出强烈的责任心。本文开头所说的那几位同志，有的在连续作战中晕倒摔破头部，缝了三针坚持工作；有的母亲病故，噩耗传来直到完成任务才回家；有的水土不服，加上受暑，多次呕吐仍夜以继日地工作……
    这一切，使李林祥感到，我们的干部绝大多数是好的，我们的职工也是好的。只要领导态度坚决，认真开展反腐败斗争，就可增强广大群众的向心力，使人们真心实意靠拢党！
