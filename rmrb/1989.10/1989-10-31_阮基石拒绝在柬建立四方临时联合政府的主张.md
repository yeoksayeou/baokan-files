Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 30th.

Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Hoc once again expressed his rejection of the proposal to establish a four-party provisional joint government in Cambodia during an interview on October 29th.

Vietnamese newspapers today published Nguyen Co Hoc's remarks on the Cambodian issue to the Vietnam News Agency reporter on October 29th.

Nguyen Co Hoc claimed, "The establishment of a temporary power structure is an internal matter of Cambodia," and unreasonably accused the proposal to form a four-party joint government of attempting to "eliminate" the "political and military realities" that have formed in Cambodia over the past decade.

He also accused the "three factions of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front" of demanding "a highly unreasonable share of four-thirds of the political and military power in Cambodia." He said, "The Phnom Penh side cannot accept this."

It is well known that the current situation in Cambodia is the result of Vietnam's decade-long invasion, and the Phnom Penh regime is one that Vietnam has propped up with bayonets. Vietnam not only must withdraw all its troops from Cambodia but also bears an inescapable responsibility for eliminating the consequences of its invasion. Nguyen Co Hoc's use of "internal matter" to block international public opinion is obviously absurd and laughable.

### 阮基石拒绝在柬建立四方临时联合政府的主张

　　阮基石拒绝在柬建立四方临时联合政府的主张
    新华社河内10月30日电  越南外长阮基石29日在一次谈话中再次表示拒绝在柬埔寨建立四方临时联合政府的正确主张。
    越南报纸今天刊登了阮基石29日就柬埔寨问题对越通社记者发表的谈话。
    阮基石声称，“成立临时权力机构是柬内部问题”，并无理指责成立四方联合政府的建议是所谓“取消”柬埔寨十年来形成的“政治、军事实际状况”。
    他还指责“民柬三方在柬分享四分之三的政治、军事权力”是所谓“十分无理的要求”。他说，对此，金边方面“不能接受”。
    众所周知，柬目前的局面是越南十多年入侵造成的，金边政权是越南用刺刀扶植起来的。越南不仅必须从柬全部撤军，而且对消除侵柬后果负有不可推卸的责任。阮基石用“内部问题”来堵塞国际公正舆论，显然荒唐可笑。
