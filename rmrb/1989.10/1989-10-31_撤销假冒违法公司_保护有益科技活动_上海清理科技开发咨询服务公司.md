Shanghai is paying close attention to policy implementation while cleaning up and rectifying technology development and consulting service companies. The city is resolutely shutting down those companies that falsely claim to be engaged in technology but are actually involved in wholesale trading and other illegal activities. At the same time, Shanghai continues to protect and support activities that convert technological achievements into real productive forces.

Shanghai has established a multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form technology market network. There are currently 840 technology consulting institutions, over 160 scientific research units and universities operating technology enterprises, and more than 500 privately-run technology institutions. Generally speaking, these technology development and consulting service companies have played an active role in promoting the integration of science and technology with production and accelerating the transfer of technology to production departments. However, there are also varying degrees of disorder. The main problems are: some companies use the guise of technology operations to engage in wholesale trading, intermediary commerce, and other non-technical activities, enjoying the preferential treatment given to technical activities; some institutions have loopholes in their organizational and financial systems; and a few technology operation institutions and personnel have engaged in illegal and criminal activities.

The Municipal Science and Technology Commission, in conjunction with relevant departments, has absorbed the opinions of scientific research units and formulated the "Opinions on the Clean-up and Rectification of Technology Development and Consulting Service Companies." It clearly proposes the tasks of the clean-up and rectification: first, to resolutely shut down and merge companies that do not meet the conditions, have no need to exist, are redundantly set up, and have serious violations of laws and regulations. The focus is on shutting down companies set up by various levels of party and government organs; companies that use technology development and consulting services as a cover to engage in wholesale trading, commerce, and the resale of production materials in the circulation sector; companies that have been operating poorly for a long time, have incurred serious losses, and are already insolvent; and companies that have serious violations of laws and discipline. Second, to seriously investigate and deal with cases of lawlessness and disorder, especially major cases involving leaders at the section chief level and above. Third, through the clean-up and rectification, to gradually establish and improve the various regulations and systems of the companies, so as to ensure the healthy development of technology development and consulting services.

On October 26, the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Taxation Bureau jointly issued a "Notice," announcing that starting from November 1, all technology development and consulting service companies must be re-registered and approved.

Starting from January 1 next year, any institution that has not been re-registered and approved and obtained a qualified certificate will not be allowed to engage in technology development or consulting service business operations.

    本报上海10月30日电　记者萧关根报道：上海市在清理整顿科技开发、咨询服务公司的工作中注意掌握政策：坚决撤掉那些假冒科技之名，从事批发、经商之实的违章违法公司；继续保护和支持把科技成果转化为现实生产力的有益活动。
    上海已形成一个多层次、多渠道、多形式的技术市场网络。现有840家科技咨询机构，160多家科研单位和高等院校办的科技企业和500多家民办科技机构。从总体上说，这些科技开发、咨询服务公司为促进科技与生产相结合、加快科技向生产部门的转移发挥了积极作用，但也不同程度地存在混乱现象。主要问题表现在：打着科技经营牌子，从事批发贸易、中介经商和其它非技术活动，享受技术性活动的优惠；一些机构的组织、财务制度存在漏洞；少数技术经营机构和人员有违法犯罪行为。
    市科委会同有关部门，吸收科研单位的意见，制订了《关于清理整顿科技开发、咨询服务公司工作的意见》，明确提出清理整顿的任务：一是坚决撤并一批不具备条件、没有存在必要、重复设置和严重违章违法的公司，重点是砍掉各级党政机关开办的公司；以科技开发、咨询服务为名，实际从事流通领域中与业务无关的商品批发、贸易和转手倒卖生产资料的公司；长期经营不善、严重亏损、已经资不抵债的公司，以及严重违法乱纪的公司。二是认真查处违法乱纪案件，特别是有处级以上领导干部参与的大案要案。三是通过清理整顿，逐步建立健全公司的各项法规和制度，以保证科技开发和咨询服务健康发展。
    10月26日，上海市科委、市工商局和市税务局联合发出《通告》，宣布从11月1日起，所有科技开发、咨询服务公司都必须重新登记、审批。
    自明年1月1日起，凡未经重新登记审批并取得合格证书的机构，一律不得从事科技开发或咨询服务的经营业务。
