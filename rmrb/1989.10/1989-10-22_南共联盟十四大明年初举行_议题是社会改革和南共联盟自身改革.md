Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, October 20th — The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held a plenary meeting on October 20th and decided to convene the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in Belgrade from January 20th to 22nd, 1990. The main agenda of the congress will be "Social Reform and the Reform of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia."

Under normal circumstances, the 14th Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia should have been held in June 1990. However, due to the failure to implement the resolutions of the 13th Congress and the deteriorating political and economic situation in Yugoslavia, local party organizations have proposed to convene an extraordinary congress ahead of schedule.

In April of this year, the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia decided to convene the 14th Congress ahead of schedule in December. Due to disagreements among the party leadership of various republics and autonomous provinces on issues such as economic system reform, political system reform, and the reform of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the preparatory work for the 14th Congress has progressed slowly, and the congress had to be postponed to January 1990.

The plenary meeting discussed and approved in principle the draft document for the 14th Congress, "Economic Reform and the Role and Tasks of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in Implementing Economic Reform."

The plenary meeting also elected Varoshilja as a member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

　　南共联盟十四大明年初举行
　　议题是社会改革和南共联盟自身改革
    新华社贝尔格莱德10月20日电　（记者徐坤明）南共联盟中央委员会20日举行全体会议决定，将于1990年1月20日至22日在贝尔格莱德召开南共联盟第14次非常代表大会，党代会的主要议程是《社会改革和南共联盟自身的改革》。
    在正常情况下，南共联盟14大应在1990年6月召开。由于13大的决议未能贯彻落实，而南斯拉夫政治经济形势不断恶化，各地党组织提出了提前召开非常代表大会的要求。
    今年4月，南共联盟中央委员会曾决定在今年12月提前召开第14次代表大会。由于各共和国与自治省党的领导机构对经济体制改革、政治体制改革和共盟自身改革等问题存在不少分歧，14大的筹备工作进展较慢，党代会不得不推迟到明年1月举行。
    这次全会讨论并原则通过了为14大起草的文件《经济改革和共盟在实行经济改革中的作用和任务》。
    全会还补选瓦罗什利亚为南共联盟中央主席团委员。
