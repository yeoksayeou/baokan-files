The first exhibition hall in China named after an archaeological culture, the Upper Residence Culture Exhibition Hall, has recently been completed and held a preview in Pinggu County, a suburb of Beijing.

Upper Residence Culture was named by Beijing's cultural relics experts after four years of research on the Upper Residence site and the Beidiankou site, starting in 1984. These two sites are located in Pinggu County, a suburb of Beijing.

Radiocarbon dating indicates that the two sites are approximately 7,000 years old. Over 3,000 artifacts have been unearthed, including a bird-headed perforated instrument used for religious rituals, which is a first in China for its intricate design.

Professor Hou Renzhi, a renowned geographer, believes that the Upper Residence Culture site predates the Banpo site in Xi'an. It shows that within the two major primitive cultural regions of the Northeast and the Central Plains, there were different primitive cultures coexisting.

The exhibition hall displays various stone tools for production, such as hammered, chiseled, and ground stone tools, as well as pottery items like bowls, basins, and jars made of clay.

    京郊建成上宅文化陈列馆
    专家认为上宅遗址早于西安半坡遗址
    新华社北京10月4日电　（记者苏会志）我国第一个以考古学文化命名的陈列馆——上宅文化陈列馆最近在京郊平谷县建成并举行预展。
    上宅文化是北京市的文物专家从1984年起，对上宅遗址和北埝头遗址经过4年研究定名的。
    这两个遗址位于京郊平谷县境内。
    经测定，两处遗址距今7000年左右，共出土文物3000多件，其中宗教祭祀用的鸟头形镂孔器，设计精巧，在我国属首次发现。
    著名地理学家侯仁之教授认为，上宅文化遗址早于西安的半坡遗址，它表明在东北和中原两大原始文化区内，有不同的原始文化共存。
    在陈列馆内展出的器物中，有各种打制、琢制和磨制的石器生产工具，泥质碗、钵、罐等陶器。
