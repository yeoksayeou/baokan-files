The 25th World Gymnastics Championships opened last night at the Schleyer Sports Hall in Stuttgart, West Germany. Over the next 9 days, 400 athletes from 47 countries and regions will compete for 12 gold medals in the men's and women's team events and 10 individual events. The compulsory exercises for the team event will begin this morning.

The Chinese gymnastics team arrived in West Germany on September 28 and has since participated in friendly competitions and training sessions in Arlen and Koblenz. They told reporters that everything is going smoothly, with no major injuries. If they perform to their potential, they have a good chance in the team event. The Chinese team has considerable strength, with Li Jing, Li Bo, and Wang Chongsheng all having achieved good results in international competitions and possessing rich experience.

The Chinese men's team had a good performance in their first match today. By the time this report was filed, Li Bo and Guo Linxian had completed their compulsory exercises, scoring 56.95 and 56.90 respectively. Among the 64 athletes who competed in the first two rounds, their scores were only surpassed by the Soviet athlete Valentin Mogilny's 58.45. Li Jing will compete in the third round for China. The women's team event will begin at 23:30 Beijing time. This competition adopts the new rules approved by the International Gymnastics Federation at the 1988 congress in Seoul, where athletes from the same team are divided into different groups and compete on different days. Therefore, it is still difficult to predict the team event results.

Only four of the 10 individual event champions from the previous championships are present this time: Romania's Dobre (female), Silivas (female), East Germany's Kroll (male), and the Soviet Union's Artemyev (male). The multiple world champion Bilozertsev was expelled from the Soviet team for alcoholism, which is regrettable for the local audience.

    第25届世界体操锦标赛开幕
    中国男队国林显李舸初战告捷
    本报斯图加特10月14日电  记者江建国报道：第25届世界体操锦标赛昨晚在西德斯图加特的施莱尔体育馆开幕。来自47个国家和地区的400多名体操运动员在今后9天将激烈争夺男女团体及10个单项的总计12块金牌。团体赛中的规定动作比赛今天上午渐次展开。
    中国体操队已于9月28日抵达西德，先后在阿伦和科布伦茨进行了友好比赛和训练。他们对记者说，中国队一切顺利，无重大伤病，如果发挥正常，团体赛很有希望。中国队有相当实力，男队李敬、李舸、王崇升均在国际比赛中拿过好名次，具有比赛经验。
    中国男队今天首战成绩不错。李舸和国林显到记者发稿时为止已经结束了规定动作的比赛，总分分别是56.95和56.90，在前两轮总计64名运动员中，仅次于苏联运动员瓦伦丁·莫吉里尼的58.45分。第三轮比赛中国将有李敬出场。女队团体赛将在北京时间23时30分开始。本届比赛采取1988年国际体联代表大会在汉城通过的新规则，同一代表团的运动员在团体赛中分在不同小组，不同的日子比赛，因此，团体赛战绩现在尚难估计。
    上届大赛中的10个单项冠军这次只有4人到场，他们是罗马尼亚的多布雷（女）、西利瓦斯（女）、民主德国的克罗尔（男）和苏联的阿尔捷莫夫（男）。多次世界冠军获得者比洛泽尔采夫因酗酒被苏联队开除，不免使此间观众略感遗憾。
