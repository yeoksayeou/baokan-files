Tomorrow, 130 million Young Pioneers across the nation will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Young Pioneers. This afternoon, Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Song Ping met warmly with outstanding Young Pioneers and child workers representatives from across the nation in Zhongnanhai. Jiang Zemin made an important speech.

Jiang Zemin first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Young Pioneers! He also expressed sincere greetings to the Young Pioneers workers!

Jiang Zemin pointed out that we must educate young children in communist beliefs, socialist ideology, and patriotism. We must educate them in revolutionary traditions and national traditions. Only in this way can they have a strong immunity to the corruption of bourgeois ideology and become the pillars of the future of our nation.

Jiang Zemin said, after reading the reports of the heroic deeds of Young Pioneer Li Ning and other Young Pioneers, I was deeply moved. Li Ning, as a 14-year-old child, could bravely rush into danger to save others, truly setting an example for us to learn from. The Young Pioneers are the reserve force of the communist cause. Our country has 130 million Young Pioneers. If our next generation can all be like the ten outstanding Young Pioneers, with unlimited love for the motherland and the Communist Party, diligent in study, and indomitable, then our nation will be invincible!

Jiang Zemin said, a few months ago, the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing made us realize more clearly that the biggest mistake in the past ten years, as pointed out by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, mainly refers to the mistake in ideological and political education. The ideological and political battlefield, if the proletariat does not occupy, the bourgeoisie will occupy. Strengthening ideological and political education must start from young children. Therefore, child workers bear a heavy historical responsibility.

Jiang Zemin finally said passionately, the Young Pioneers of today will be the pillars of the nation in 20 years. You have a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. The world is yours!

Li Peng, in his speech, wished all child workers a smooth work and good health, and hoped that they would cultivate the successors of the motherland's cause.

Jiang Zemin and others also met with nine of the ten outstanding Young Pioneers in the nation and the parents of the young hero Li Ning.

Other leaders present at the meeting included Li Tieying, Ding Guanggen, Hu Qiaomu, Kang Keqing, and Luo Gan.

After the meeting, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the National Federation of Young Pioneers held a symposium on strengthening the ideological education of young children in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai. Sixty comrades from across the nation who have long been engaged in child work participated in the symposium.

Song Defu, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, gave a speech titled "Cultivating the Successors of the Proletarian Revolutionary Cause from an Early Age."

Song Defu said, the Young Pioneers must seriously educate the broad masses of members in revolutionary ideals based on patriotism; in moral qualities with collectivism as the main content; in revolutionary traditions with learning from models as the main activity; and in labor education starting from cultivating the ability to be self-reliant.

He said, all levels of the Youth League organizations must actively and proactively help the Young Pioneers organizations solve practical difficulties and care for, love, and guide the counselors in politics, work, study, and life.

Song Defu finally said, he hoped that all Young Pioneers across the nation would learn from the "ten outstanding" and, from an early age, establish far-reaching revolutionary ideals, strive to cultivate noble moral sentiments, study cultural knowledge diligently, exercise their bodies, and enhance their physiques.

Others who spoke at the symposium included Wu Yinhong, Duan Zhen, Li Fa, Wang Xufang, Jin Chengxu, Shang Lijin, and Wu Guotong. Ten outstanding Young Pioneers Cheng Jie, Wu Yan, and Li Ning's classmate Zhou Wei also spoke.

    江泽民李鹏等会见优秀少年和少儿工作者代表
    加强少儿思想教育  造就国家栋梁之材
    本报北京10月12日讯　记者廖玒报道：明天，全国一亿三千万少先队员将迎来少先队建队40周年纪念日。今天下午，党和国家领导人江泽民、李鹏、乔石、宋平等在中南海亲切会见了全国优秀少先队员和少儿工作者代表。江泽民总书记作了重要讲话。
    江泽民首先代表党中央、国务院向少先队建队40周年表示热烈祝贺！向少先队工作者表示诚挚慰问！
    江泽民指出，要对少年儿童进行共产主义信念、社会主义思想、爱国主义精神的教育，对他们进行革命传统、民族传统教育，只有这样，才能使他们对资产阶级思想的腐蚀具有较强的免疫力，成为国家未来的栋梁之材。
    江泽民说，看了少年英雄赖宁和其他少先队员事迹的报道，非常感动，赖宁作为一个14岁的孩子，能见义勇为，赴汤蹈火在所不惜，确实是我们学习的榜样。少先队是共产主义事业的预备队，我国有一亿三千万少先队员，如果我们的下一代，都能像十佳少先队员那样，对祖国、对共产党无限热爱，勤奋学习，坚韧不拔，我们的民族就是不可战胜的！
    江泽民说，几个月前北京发生的反革命暴乱，使我们更清楚地认识到，邓小平同志所说的十年最大的失误是教育指的主要就是思想政治教育的失误。思想政治阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就会去占领。加强思想政治教育必须从少年儿童抓起，因此，少儿工作者肩负着重大的历史责任。
    江泽民最后充满激情地说，现在的少先队员20年后就是国家的栋梁，你们任重道远，世界是你们的！
    李鹏在讲话中祝广大少儿工作者工作顺利，身体健康，把孩子们培养成为祖国事业的接班人。
    江泽民等还同全国十佳少先队员中的九位和少年英雄赖宁的父母亲切会面。
    参加会见的领导同志还有：李铁映、丁关根、胡乔木、康克清、罗干等。
    会见后，团中央、全国少工委在中南海怀仁堂召开加强少年儿童思想教育座谈会。来自全国各地的60位长期从事少儿工作的同志参加了座谈。
    团中央第一书记宋德福在座谈会上做了题为《要从小培养无产阶级革命事业接班人》的讲话。
    宋德福说，少先队要认真对广大队员进行以爱国主义为基础的革命理想教育；以集体主义为主要内容的道德品质教育；以学英模为主要活动的革命传统教育；以培养自立能力为起点的劳动教育。
    他说，各级团组织要积极主动地帮助少先队组织解决实际困难，在政治、工作、学习、生活等方面关心爱护辅导员。
    宋德福最后说，希望全国的少先队员向“十佳”学习，从小树立远大革命理想，努力培养高尚的道德情操，刻苦学习文化知识，锻炼身体，增强体魄。
    在座谈会上发言的还有：吴芸红、段镇、李发、王遐方、金承续、尚丽琴、吴国通，全国十佳少先队员成洁、吴燕和赖宁的同学周伟也发了言。
