According to the "Decision of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council on Several Matters of Immediate Concern to the People," with the approval of the Party Central Committee and the State Council leaders, the following regulations are made on the allocation and management of cars for central party and government agencies:

1.	Ministerial-level (including ministerial-level) cadres shall be allocated one car each.
2.	Deputy ministerial-level cadres shall not be allocated cars. Their work-related car use shall be guaranteed. Retired deputy ministerial-level cadres, those who have not yet retired but are no longer in active service, and deputy ministerial-level cadres who enjoy ministerial-level benefits after retirement shall not be allocated cars. Deputy ministers who were allocated cars before the issuance of the "Several Provisional Regulations on the Living Allowances of Newly Appointed Deputy Ministers and Above by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council (Zhongbanfa [1983] No. 39)" and in accordance with the "Several Regulations on the Living Allowances of Senior Cadres by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council (Zhongfa [1979] No. 83)" shall continue to use their cars, but when the cadres themselves do not need the car, it shall be managed and used by the agency.
3.	The cars for the leaders of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council shall be allocated and managed by the departments responsible for their living services. The allocation of cars for ministerial-level cadres in various departments shall be approved by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee or the General Office of the State Council. Departments shall not arbitrarily allocate or replace cars for leading cadres.
4.	In the future, departments shall not purchase imported cars (except for those imported under long-term trade agreements signed between governments and technical trade contracts approved by the state). Members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Secretariat, and members of the State Council shall use domestically produced cars. Ministerial-level cadres shall gradually use domestically produced cars according to actual conditions. Currently used imported cars shall continue to be used as much as possible, and domestically produced cars shall be allocated when they reach the condition of being scrapped and replaced, to avoid new waste.
5.	Overseas missions shall strengthen the management of car use. A portion of mid- and low-end cars shall be allocated for general official business. Cars that must be retired shall be handled locally as much as possible. It is strictly forbidden to use the disposal of retired cars as a pretext to import cars.
6.	The system of charging for private use of cars shall be strictly enforced. All cadres and staff in agencies shall not use official cars for private matters. In cases of special necessity to use a car, the charges shall be strictly enforced in accordance with the regulations. All departments shall strictly enforce the unified regulations on the registration of car use and charging for private use of cars.
7.	Strengthen the supervision and inspection of car allocation and use. Departments responsible for car allocation shall strictly allocate cars in accordance with the regulations; departments responsible for car use shall conduct regular inspections, and problems found shall be promptly solved and rectified. This regulation shall be conveyed to the staff of the agencies, and the public is welcome to supervise the allocation and use of cars by leading cadres. The disciplinary inspection and supervision departments shall fulfill their duties and seriously investigate and deal with problems of violating the regulations on car allocation and use.
8.	The allocation and use of cars in enterprises and institutions affiliated with various departments shall also be handled in accordance with these regulations.
9.	Past regulations on car allocation and use that are inconsistent with these regulations shall be executed in accordance with these regulations. Cars that have been allocated in violation of the regulations shall be retrieved in accordance with the regulations.

    对中央党政机关汽车配备使用管理
    中办国办作出九条规定
    要求各部门月底前上报落实情况
    新华社北京10月16日电  中共中央办公厅国务院办公厅关于中央党政机关汽车配备和使用管理的规定
      （1989年9月6日）
    根据《中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》，经党中央、国务院领导同志同意，对中央党政机关汽车配备和使用管理问题作如下规定：
    一、正部长级以上（含正部长级）干部，按一人一辆配备专车。
    二、副部长级干部一律不配备专车，其工作用车予以保证。已离休的副部长级干部、退出现职尚未办离休手续的副部长级干部和副部长级干部离休后享受正部长级待遇的干部，也不配备专车。《中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅关于新任副部长、副省长以上干部生活待遇的几项暂行规定》（中办发〔1983〕39号）下发执行以前，已按《中共中央、国务院关于高级干部生活待遇的若干规定》（中发〔1979〕83号）配备专车的副部长，其专车可继续保留，但本人不用车时，由机关调度使用。
    三、党中央和国务院领导同志的专车，由负责其生活服务工作的部门配备和管理。各部门正部长级干部专车的配备，需经中共中央直属机关事务管理局或国务院机关事务管理局审批。各部门不得擅自为领导干部配备或调换专车。
    四、今后各部门均不准再购买进口小轿车（执行政府间已签定的长期贸易协定和国家批准的技术贸易合同进口的小轿车除外）。中央政治局、书记处成员和国务院常务会议组成人员一律使用国产车。正部长级干部，要根据实际情况，逐步使用国产车。现在使用的进口车，尽可能继续使用，达到报废更新条件时再换配国产车，避免造成新的浪费。
    五、驻境外机构要加强汽车的使用管理。应配备一部分中、低档车作为一般公务用。必须退役的车辆应尽量在当地处理。严禁以处理退役车为名变相进口汽车。
    六、坚持因私用车收费制度。所有机关干部和职工均不得用公车办私事，遇有特殊情况必须用车的，一律按规定收费。各部门都要严格执行统一规定的专车使用登记和因私用车收费制度。
    七、加强汽车配备和使用的监督检查。负责车辆配备管理的部门要严格按规定配车；负责车辆使用管理的部门要定期进行检查，发现问题要及时解决和纠正。本规定要向机关职工传达，欢迎群众对领导干部配车和用车情况进行监督。纪检机关和监察部门要履行职责，认真查处违反车辆配备和使用规定的问题。
    八、各部门所属企业、事业单位车辆的配备和使用也按本规定办理。
    九、过去有关汽车配备和使用的规定，凡与本规定不一致的，一律按本规定执行。凡不符合配备专车规定而配备了专车的，必须按规定收回。各部门要在10月底以前将落实本规定的情况报中共中央直属机关事务管理局或国务院机关事务管理局，由中共中央直属机关事务管理局和国务院机关事务管理局分别汇总后报党中央、国务院。
