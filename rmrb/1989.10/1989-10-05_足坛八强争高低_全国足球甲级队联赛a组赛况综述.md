The top eight teams in the national first-tier football league A group took a break in late September. This year, the eight teams in the A group will compete in two rounds, and then their rankings will be determined based on points. The two teams with the lowest points will be demoted to the B group.

The competition for the top eight is now in the second half. Currently, the national second team leads with 7 wins, 2 draws, and 1 loss, accumulating 23 points. The national second team has two tactical approaches, switching between them based on the situation on the field. One approach involves rapid positioning and interchanges to create space, with midfielders quickly moving forward to create scoring opportunities. The other approach utilizes two forwards, both over 1.90 meters tall, to create threats with their headers in front of the opponent's goal. These tactics are supported by abundant stamina, good attitudes, and strong mental states. The national second team's results are not accidental but a natural outcome of their training level, which surpasses that of their sibling teams.

The Shanghai team has won all five of their recent matches, rapidly accumulating points, with a total record of 9 wins, 6 draws, 1 loss, and 19 points, temporarily placing them in second. This team has experienced players with unique styles on every line, leading a vibrant group of young newcomers. Recently, they defeated the Liaoning team 2-0, marking their first victory against Liaoning since 1986.

The Liaoning team has a record of 9 wins, 5 draws, 3 losses, and 17 points. Although Liaoning is temporarily in third place, they remain a strong team with the potential to defend their national championship title. However, the main lineup of the Liaoning team seems to be aging, and their position as the domestic football "dynasty" is becoming unstable.

The eighth team, the Bayi team, primarily consists of young players, showing great potential. However, they lack psychological stability and experience, and their defensive line is still weak.

The other four teams are as follows: the Guangdong team with 3 wins, 2 draws, 5 losses, and 11 points; the Shandong team with 2 wins, 5 draws, 3 losses, and 11 points; the Tianjin Zhonghuan team with 2 wins, 1 draw, 5 losses, and 7 points; and the Guangzhou team with 9 draws, 3 losses, and 3 points. The Tianjin and Guangdong teams are facing the threat of being demoted to the B group.

    足坛八强争高低
    ——全国足球甲级队联赛A组赛况综述
    全国足球甲级队联赛A组赛事于9月下旬休战。今年A组八强须作两个循环的较量，然后依据积分排列座次，列最后两名的队将跌入B组。
    八强争夺已进入后半程，目前国家二队以7胜2平1负的战绩积23分，暂列首席。国家二队有两套打法，视场上情态变化而交替使用。一套是进攻中通过快速的跑位穿插拉开空档，前卫迅猛插上制造射门机会；一套是利用两位身高超过1.90米的前锋头球策应，在对方门前制造险情，得机问鼎。而这些打法，又以充沛的体能、良好的作风和精神面貌为基础。国家二队所取得的战绩绝非偶然，是他们超出兄弟球队训练水平的必然结果。
    上海队最近一阶段五战皆胜，积分扶摇直上，总成绩为9战6胜1平2负，以19分暂居第二位。这个队每条线上都有两名颇具经验又有个人特色的老队员，带领生气勃勃的年轻新人作战。他们日前以两球力克辽宁队，这是沪军自1986年以来与辽宁队交锋中的首次获胜。
    辽宁队成绩为9战5胜2平3负，得17分。辽宁虽暂列第三位，仍不失为一支劲旅，并有蝉联全国冠军的实力。然而，辽宁队排出的主力阵容，又给人趋向“老化”之感，其国内足坛“霸主”的位置已坐不稳了。
    列第四位的八一队多以年轻选手奔驰在赛场，颇有生机，问题是心理不稳定，经验不丰富，后卫防线犹显薄弱。
    另4支队伍，广东队3胜2平5负积11分；山东队2胜5平3负积11分；天津中环队2胜1平5负积7分；广州队9战3平6负积3分。津穗两队正面临降入B组的困境。白金贵
