Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 22nd.

The "homeland of the pandas"—Baoxing County in Sichuan Province—has good news to report: the cold-arrow bamboo that had previously withered and died is gradually recovering, with young shoots growing to 20 to 30 centimeters; the conditions for the pandas' survival are becoming more normal. Currently, except for two towns, all 11 townships in the county have discovered traces of panda activity this year, with 16 places frequently visited by pandas.

In 1983, the giant panda's main food source, high-altitude cold-arrow bamboo, experienced a periodic flowering, causing 90% of the 600,000 mu of bamboo in Baoxing County, which accounts for more than 1/5 of the wild panda population in the country, to wither and die. The giant pandas faced imminent extinction. With the strong support of various levels of party and government departments, Baoxing County launched a large-scale rescue operation.

　　宝兴县冷箭竹恢复
　　大熊猫重新返故乡
    据新华社成都10月22日电  （记者师文宴、通讯员王涛）“熊猫的故乡”——四川省宝兴县传来喜讯：原来开花枯死的冷箭竹逐步恢复，幼苗已长20至30厘米；熊猫的生存条件日趋正常。目前，全县除两个镇外，11个乡今年均发现熊猫活动的踪迹，经常活动的地方达16处。
    1983年，大熊猫主食高山冷箭竹出现周期性开花，野外熊猫存有量占全国1／5以上的宝兴县，60万亩箭竹90％枯死，大熊猫面临灭顶之灾，在各级党政部门的大力支持下，宝兴县展开了大规模的抢救工作。
