Title: Comprehensive Management Should Not Become No One's Responsibility

Comprehensive management is a good experience of various relevant functional departments closely cooperating to manage society.

Practice has shown that in areas such as public security, family planning, environmental protection, and urban construction, comprehensive management can indeed achieve remarkable results.

Recently, the concept of "comprehensive management" has been used more and more frequently, and there is even a tendency for it to be misused. During a rural investigation, the author found that some grassroots cadres use "comprehensive management" as an excuse to shirk responsibility. Matters that functional departments could handle through effort are presented as beyond their capability; tasks that are clearly within their jurisdiction are passed around, with no one taking charge or paying attention, and they even reasonably say: "Without comprehensive management, what can we do as just one department?" This has led to lax management in certain areas, and some incidents that should not have happened did occur. The author believes that this approach not only delays work but is also, strictly speaking, a dereliction of duty.

Comprehensive management is not about everyone sharing responsibility indiscriminately. It is about clear division of labor and each taking responsibility for their part. For any task, the specific functional department in charge must first take responsibility. Except for major social issues that affect the whole society and require comprehensive management, most daily specific work still needs to emphasize each doing their own job and taking responsibility. No department official should use "comprehensive management" as an excuse to shirk their own responsibilities.

### “综合治理”不能变成无人治理

　　“综合治理”不能变成无人治理
　　郭增铨
    “综合治理”是各个有关的职能部门密切配合实行社会管理的一个好经验。
    实践表明，在社会治安、计划生育、环境保护、市政建设等方面，实行综合治理确实可以收到显著的效果。
    近来，“综合治理”的提法用得越来越普遍，甚至有被滥用之势。笔者在农村调查时发现，有的基层干部所说的“综合治理”实际上成为他们推卸责任的借口。职能部门本来经过努力可以办好的事，却表现出无能为力的姿态；责无旁贷的份内之事，也推来推去，谁也不抓，谁也不管，还蛮有理地说：“不综合治理，单靠我们一个部门有什么办法？”致使某些方面管理松弛，一些不该发生的事发生了。笔者认为，这种做法不仅贻误了工作，而且严格地说也是一种失职行为。
    综合治理不是不分责任，大家有份。而是要分工明确，各负其责。任何一项工作首先具体分管的职能部门要负起责任。除了对一些影响重大，牵动面广的社会问题必须实行全社会综合治理外，大量日常具体工作还是要强调各司其职、各负其责，任何一个部门的干部都不应以“综合治理”为借口推卸自己的责任。
