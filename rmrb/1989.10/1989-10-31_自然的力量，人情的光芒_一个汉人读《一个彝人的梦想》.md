A few years ago, when Ji Dima Jia gave me his award-winning debut poetry collection, "The Song of First Love," he expressed a wish: to pause and change, to avoid repeating himself.

Now, in the autumn of 1989, as I read his second poetry collection, "A Yi Person's Dream" (published by the Nationalities Press), I wonder if Ji Dima Jia regrets his earlier wish. In my view, Ji Dima Jia has not changed much; instead, he has made his poetic style more pure and more individual. If "The Song of First Love" did not fully prove the young poet's intrinsic connection to the blood and culture of the Yi people, then "A Yi Person's Dream" will: without the Great Snowy Mountains and the Yi people, there would be no such poet.

This poet is a mystery to us who live within the Han cultural sphere. We Han cultural poets have been obsessed for years with the idea of "returning to poetry itself," using every trick in the book to make poetic expression more complex or richer, in order to give poetry eternal artistic charm.

However, those who have read Ji Dima Jia's poetry will find: he has no complex or rich methods of expression. In fact, his poetic expression is surprisingly simple, yet Ji Dima Jia's poetry is by no means lacking in charm.

I am not exaggerating the simplicity of Ji Dima Jia's poetic expression. Nearly 50 of the lyrical poems in "A Yi Person's Dream" are completed in this simple manner. His expression, so simple and unified, does not make one feel monotonous or boring. I think this must be attributed to the Yi people's long cultural tradition. The prototype of his poetic expression is the Yi proverbs. His poems are full of the shadows of Yi proverbs, such as "Without starlight / There might still be warmth" ("To Myself") and "The eagle in the sky / Also has its moments of standing still" ("Lullaby"). The infectious power of these proverbs is truly wondrous. We cannot imagine how the Yi people chose such a proverb style. Now, a modern Yi poet, who has been influenced by modern civilization, once again chooses it. Ji Dima Jia skillfully and creatively uses the Yi style in his singing: listing metaphors, and in the listing, either simply or elaborately, rising to a climax in the listing. "Land" is an example.

Ji Dima Jia's poetic expression is like a strongman's weightlifting performance: gripping the barbell, lifting the barbell, raising it to the chest, lifting it over the head. Reading his poetry, I feel a forceful impact, a resilient forceful impact. When talking about the poet's resilient force characteristics, I can no longer be confined to the poetic expression method. I must enter the core of his poetry. As the title of this article states, this Yi poet's poetry has the power of nature and the radiance of humanity, and it is this kind of power that deeply moves me.

Flipping through "A Yi Person's Dream," each poem is filled with members of nature (such as sheep, roosters, paths, rivers, rocks, etc.) and the kind-hearted Yi people's actions and emotions with a strong human touch (such as horsemen, the love story of a headscarf, old singers, etc.). Things of nature and things of humanity are the two centers that Ji Dima Jia always cherishes and is intoxicated by.

It is no secret that the Yi people, like many other ethnic groups of the Chinese nation, although they have an ancient civilization, are a backward people today. The Yi poet Ji Dima Jia, like many poets of other ethnic groups (such as the Han), longs for the prosperity and development of his own people, which requires changing the backward status quo.

The poet's uniqueness lies in the fact that he does not take the critical elements of the present state of backwardness as the focus of his sensitivity and excitement; he directly enters the realm of Yi civilization (both human and geographical) that will forever endure, singing "dirges"—a series of moving songs of remembrance—for things that should not be buried. The poem titled "Dakisha Luo's Hometown" in the collection can serve as evidence: I admit that all pain comes from there / I admit that all sorrow comes from there / I admit that the legend of misfortune also seems mysterious / I admit that all nights are filled with melancholy / ... / I admit that naked children climb the mud walls / I admit those ordinary lives / I admit that the mother's smile also contains sadness / Ah, I admit that this is the land that gave birth to me / Even if one day I reach the magnificent Shimu Muha / I will cry out and return to her bosom.

Needless to say, the things in Yi civilization that should never be buried are: those beautiful things of nature and those beautiful human affairs. No matter how developed human society is, people need beautiful nature and beautiful human affairs; perhaps it is more appropriate to say that the more developed human society is, the more people need beautiful nature and beautiful human affairs. Because ultimately, it is they who give us (humankind) a life of joy and relaxation; because ultimately, it is they who comfort the life wounds left behind in our pursuit.

I think it is very likely that it is the natural things and human affairs of the Daliang Mountains Yi area that comforted Ji Dima Jia's melancholy heart and gave him the joy and relaxation of life. Ji Dima Jia wrote these lyrical poems full of the power of nature and the radiance of humanity for the Yi people, for the Han people, and for the people of all ethnic groups. The poet uses his moving works to show that we need to have some eternal things, such as nature and humanity. Perhaps it is for these reasons that, although the poet obstinately writes about his not "modern" ethnic group, people see from his works that he is a poet with a modern sense.

### 自然的力量，人情的光芒——一个汉人读《一个彝人的梦想》

　　自然的力量，人情的光芒
　　——一个汉人读《一个彝人的梦想》
　　阿吾
    前两年，吉狄马加给我他那本后来获奖的处女诗集《初恋的歌》时，曾经表达过一种愿望：停一停再写，要有所变化，不想再重复自己。
    现在，1989年的秋天，我读着他的第二本诗集《一个彝人的梦想》
  （民族出版社出版），感到不知吉狄马加是否为几年前的愿望遗憾，因为在我看来，吉狄马加并没有太大的变化，而是把他的诗歌方式表达得更加纯粹也更加个性化了。如果说《初恋的歌》还不能完全证明年轻诗人同彝民族之血缘文化的内在联系，那么《一个彝人的梦想》会证明：没有大凉山和彝民族，就不会有这个诗人。
    这个诗人对于我们生活于汉文化圈子的众多诗人来说是一个谜。我们这些汉文化圈的诗人们，几年来津津乐道于纠缠“回到诗本身”，使出浑身解数，力图把诗歌的表达方法弄得复杂一些或丰富一些，以求诗歌具有永恒的艺术魅力。
    可是吉狄马加的诗歌，读过的人都发现：他并没有什么复杂或丰富的表达方法，事实恰恰是他的诗歌表达方法惊人的简单，然而吉狄马加的诗歌丝毫也不缺少魅力。
    我一点儿也不夸张吉狄马加诗歌表达方法的简单性，他的《一个彝人的梦想》中的近50首抒情诗基本上都被如此完成了。他这样简单如一的表达方法却不令人感到单调和乏味，我想这一定得归之于他们彝人的悠久文化传统，他诗歌表达方法的雏形便是彝族谚语。他的诗中随处可以找到彝族谚语的影子，如“没有星光／不一定就没有温暖”（《致自己》）、“天上的雄鹰／也有站立的时候”
  （《催眠曲》）。这类谚语的感染力真是奇妙无穷，我们无法想象彝人是怎样选择了这样的谚语方式。现在，一个具有现代意识、经受过现代文明熏陶的彝族诗人再一次选择了它。吉狄马加在他的吟唱中熟练并具有创造性地运用了彝人的方式：罗列比喻，在罗列中悟性地或简或繁，罗列中跃起而至高潮。《土地》就是例子。
    吉狄马加的诗歌表达就像大力士的一次挺举表演：握住杠铃、提起杠铃、举至胸前、举过头顶。读他的诗，我感到一种力的冲击，韧性的力的冲击。谈起诗人的韧性力度特征，我就再不能囿于诗歌表达方式了，我得进入他诗歌的核心。如本文题目所称，这位彝族诗人的诗歌具有自然的力量和人情的光芒，是诸如此类的力量深深地撼动了我。
    翻读《一个彝人的梦想》，首首诗中充满了大自然的成员（如绵羊、公鸡、小路、河流、岩石等等）和善良彝人带浓厚人情色彩的举止、感情（如骑手、头巾的爱情故事、老歌手等等）。大自然的东西和人情的东西是始终令吉狄马加留恋不忘和沉醉的两个中心。
    无需讳言，彝族同中华民族的众多其它民族一样，虽有古老的文明，但是今天是一个后进的民族。彝族诗人吉狄马加也如同其它民族（如汉族）的不少诗人一样，盼望着自己的民族繁荣发达，这就要求改变落后的现状。
    诗人的独特之处在于，他并没有把批判现状中落后的成分当作自己敏感和激动的重点；他在直接地进入彝族文明
  （人文的和地理的）将会永存的领域，为不该被埋葬的东西吟着“挽歌”——一曲曲动人的挽留之歌。集子中题为
  《达基沙洛故乡》的诗可为此作证：我承认一切痛苦来自那里／我承认一切悲哀来自那里／我承认不幸的传说也显得神秘／我承认所有的夜晚都充满了忧郁／……／我承认光着身的孩子爬满了土墙／我承认那些平常的生活／我承认母亲的笑意里也含着惆怅／啊，我承认这就是生我养我的故土／纵然有一天我到了富丽堂皇的石姆姆哈／我也要哭喊着回到她的怀中。
    不消说，诗歌中所表明的彝族文明中永远不该被埋葬的东西是：那些美好的自然之物和那些美好的人情世事。不管人类社会多么发达，人类都需要美好的自然和美好的人情；或许更应该说，人类社会越是发达，人类越是需要美好的自然和美好的人情。因为最终是它们，给予我们（人类）愉悦松弛的生命；因为最终是它们，给予我们在追寻中所留下的生命创伤以抚慰。
    我想，很可能正是大凉山彝族区域的那些自然之物和人情世故，抚慰了吉狄马加忧郁的心，并予以他生命的愉悦松弛，吉狄马加为彝人也为汉人，也为各民族人民写下了这些充满了自然的力量和闪烁着人情光芒的抒情诗章。诗人用他动人的作品表明，我们需要拥有一些永存的东西，就比如自然和人情。或许正是基于这样一些理由，尽管诗人固执地写着他并不“现代”的民族，人们却从作品中看到他是一位有现代感的诗人。
