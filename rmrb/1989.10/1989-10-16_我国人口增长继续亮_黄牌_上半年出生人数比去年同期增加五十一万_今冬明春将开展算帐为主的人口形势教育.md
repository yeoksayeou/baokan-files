Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 14th - Half a year has passed since the 11 billion population day, but the current population situation in China is still not optimistic. According to information from the State Family Planning Commission, the total number of births in the first half of this year increased by 510,000 compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that this year will see an increase of about 1.18 million births compared to last year, and the population growth continues to flash a bright "yellow card."

According to statistics from the State Family Planning Commission, the 510,000 increase in births in the first half of this year includes 370,000 first-born children, 140,000 second-born children, and almost no increase in third-born children or children born after the third.

The Planning and Statistics Department of the State Family Planning Commission analyzed the reasons for the increase in births: First, the number of women in the prime childbearing age group (20-29 years old) increased by more than 6.3 million compared to last year; second, some rural areas have implemented policies allowing families with only one daughter to have a second child after a few years; third, the quality of family planning statistics has improved, and the phenomenon of underreporting and misreporting has been significantly reduced; fourth, there are still some places where the grassroots work is weak, and some places are even in a state of laissez-faire, leading to continuous over-births.

In response to the slight increase in the birth rate in the first half of this year, the State Family Planning Commission proposed that all localities must not be complacent and must maintain a sober mind, take practical measures to control the rapid growth of the population, and do a good job in family planning.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 14th - Peng Peiyun, the director of the State Family Planning Commission, said today that this winter and next spring, a nationwide population situation education campaign will be launched, focusing on accounting and comparison to explain the national, local, and family situations. This will help the majority of farmers truly understand the severe population situation facing the country, understand the importance of controlling population growth, and enhance their understanding and acceptance of the current family planning policies.

At the national family planning propaganda work conference held in Hangzhou, Peng Peiyun also pointed out that in the next period, rural areas should be the focus, and extensive and in-depth population and family planning propaganda and education should be carried out among the masses. This should gradually become a regular and institutionalized effort.

More than 140 representatives from the propaganda departments and family planning commissions of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions attended the conference, which was jointly organized by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and the State Family Planning Commission. Xu Weicheng, deputy director of the Propaganda Department, presided over today's meeting.

    我国人口增长继续亮“黄牌”
    上半年出生人数比去年同期增加五十一万
    今冬明春将开展算帐为主的人口形势教育
    新华社北京10月14日电（记者于长洪）11亿人口日已过去半年，我国目前人口形势如何？来自国家计生委的信息仍不容乐观：今年上半年比去年同期出生总数增加51万，预计今年比去年多出生118万左右，人口生产继续亮出耀眼的“黄牌”。
    根据国家计划生育委员会汇总的各省市、区计划生育统计数据，今年上半年增加的51万人中，一孩增加37万，二孩增加14万，三孩和三孩以上基本没有增加。
    国家计生委规划统计司分析了造成出生增加的原因：一是今年处于生育旺盛年龄段（20—29岁）的妇女人数比去年增加630多万；二是一些农村实行了允许独女户间隔几年后生育二孩的政策；三是计划生育部门统计质量有所提高，瞒报漏报现象大大减少；四是还确有一些地方基层工作薄弱，有些地方甚至还处于放任自流状态，致使超生不断发生。
    针对今年上半年人口出生率略有上升的状况，国家计生委提出：各地万万不可掉以轻心，必须保持清醒的头脑，采取切实的措施，控制人口的过快增长，把计划生育工作抓紧抓好。
    据新华社杭州10月14日电　（记者于长洪）国家计划生育委员会主任彭珮云今天说，今冬明春将在全国开展一次以算帐对比为主要形式的人口形势教育，讲国情、乡情、家情，以使广大农民真正了解国家所面临的严峻的人口形势，懂得控制人口增长的大道理，增强对现行计划生育政策的理解和接受能力。
    在杭州召开的全国计划生育宣传工作座谈会上，彭珮云还指出，今后一个时期，要以农村为重点，广泛深入地开展全民性的人口与计划生育宣传教育，并且使之逐步经常化、制度化。
    140多名来自各省、市、自治区宣传部、计生委的负责同志参加了由中宣部和国家计生委联合召开的这次座谈会。中宣部副部长徐惟诚主持了今天的会议。
