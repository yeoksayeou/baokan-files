October 29th of this year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Li Dazhao, one of the earliest propagators of Marxism in China and a founding member of the Communist Party of China. As we commemorate this great revolutionary pioneer, the first thing that comes to my mind is his thrift. From this aspect, we can see the lofty character and broad-mindedness of this pioneer.

Li Dazhao lived a frugal life, maintaining simplicity in his personal habits, which was well-known among the faculty and students of Peking University at that time. Before his heroic martyrdom, more than 300 of his fellow townsmen and friends wrote a petition to plead for his release, mentioning that he "ate bitter food and plain rice, wore one quilt in winter and one cotton-padded jacket in summer" ("Biography of Li Dazhao," People's Publishing House, 1983, p. 226). This accurately describes his life of hardship and simplicity. He usually wore a faded cotton gown and walked from home to school every day. He often studied Marxist theories and wrote articles promoting communist ideas, working late into the night. However, his home never had electricity, and he only used an oil lamp. Despite this, he was very concerned about young people in financial difficulties and often helped them generously. At that time, his monthly salary was 120 yuan, and he often gave half of it to poor students. Seeing that he always thought of the poor scholars and neglected his own needs, Cai Yuanpei, the university president, could not help but instruct the accountant to deduct his family's daily expenses from his salary to prevent his wife from worrying about food and oil.

Li Dazhao's thrift was not the miserliness of a miser nor the self-torture of an ascetic, but rather it reflected the revolutionary spirit of a communist who takes the world as his responsibility, who endures hardships first and enjoys later. If he had wanted to enjoy life, it would not have been difficult for him as a renowned professor at that time, but he gave up such pursuits. He never forgot that "in the evening, in the streets of Beijing, there was a very miserable sound that entered the ears of the citizens, which was the cry of the poor begging for leftovers from the rich." He never forgot that "dozens of poor women and children were rolling in the dust, each with a small basket, fighting for a piece or two of unburned coal." It was for the liberation of the broad masses of laboring people that he resolutely abandoned a comfortable life and threw himself into the revolutionary struggle, ultimately sacrificing his life. It was for the fundamental interests of the broad masses of laboring people that he could stand firm in prison, defying the enemy's threats and temptations, truly embodying the spirit of "neither poverty nor hardship can move me, nor can force bend me," and leaving a shining example for the Communist Party of China of "neither wealth nor honor can corrupt me." He said: "A man born into this world should rather wear coarse cloth to keep warm, 'eat vegetables instead of meat, walk instead of riding in a carriage,' and even if it means beheading or shedding blood, he should maintain the dignity of the nation; he should never, for the sake of fine clothes and delicious food, go begging for leftovers from traitorous warlords and become a shameless accomplice and servant!" His words, which he put into practice, are still resonant today, aren't they?

The Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu wrote in his poem "Tie Fang": "Asking the guardian of the hanging carriage, how does he compare to the thrift of the emperor?"

A person's thrift actually serves as a touchstone for whether he "worries before the world does" or "enjoys before the world does." In front of this mirror, one's soul is laid bare. It is for this reason that I have always held Li Dazhao's thrift in great respect.

In a recent speech, Deng Xiaoping pointed out:
"Hard work and self-reliance are our tradition. We must continue to emphasize frugal education for the next 60 to 70 years. The more our country develops, the more we need to emphasize hard work and self-reliance." Learning from and carrying forward Li Dazhao's thrift is not of even greater practical significance today?

　　李大钊的俭德
　　王向东
    今年10月29日，是中国最早的马克思主义传播者、中国共产党的创始人之一的李大钊同志诞辰100周年纪念日。在纪念这位伟大的革命先驱的时候，我首先想起来的却是他的俭德。我们可从一个侧面看到这位先驱者的崇高品质和宽阔胸怀。
    李大钊同志生活俭朴，自奉俭约，这在当时的北京大学有口皆碑。他英勇就义之前，他的同乡好友300余人为营救他而上书陈辞，其中就说到他“茹苦食淡，冬一絮衣，夏一布衫”（《李大钊传》，人民出版社1983年版，第226页）。这是对他一生艰苦朴素的准确描述。他平时总是穿一件洗褪了色的布袍子，天天从家里步行到学校；他经常研究马克思主义的学说，写作传播共产主义思想的文章，每每工作到深夜，家里却没有安过电灯，而只是用一盏煤油灯而已。但是他非常关心家境困难的青年，往往倾囊相助。当时他每月120元薪水，就常有一大半接济了贫困青年。蔡元培校长看他一心想的是天下寒士，不顾自己，就忍不住告诉会计，发薪水时先把他的家庭日用扣下来，以免他的夫人再为柴米油盐发愁。
    大钊同志的节俭并非是守财奴式的吝啬，也不是苦行僧式的自虐，而恰恰表现了共产党人那种以天下为己任，吃苦在前享乐在后的革命精神。如果要贪图享受，以他当时知名教授的身份，并不困难，但他却放弃了这类追求。他时时刻刻忘不了“北京市内，每到吃晚饭的时候，有一种极悲惨的声音送入市民的耳鼓，这就是沿街叫苦乞怜于阔绰人家的残羹剩饭的呼号”，忘不了“几十个贫苦的女人孩子在那里拿着小筐在灰尘里滚，争着拣个一块半块的还未烧尽的煤渣”。正是为了广大的劳动人民的解放事业，他才毅然舍弃了舒适的生活，投身艰苦奋斗的革命洪流，直至献出自己的最后一滴鲜血。正是为了广大的劳动人民的根本利益，他才能够在狱中大义凛然地怒斥敌人的威胁利诱，真正做到了“贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”，并且给中国共产党人留下了一个“富贵不能淫”的光辉榜样。他说：“大丈夫生于世间，宁可粗布以御寒，‘蔬食以当肉，安步以当车’，就是断头流血，也要保持民族的气节；绝不能为了锦衣玉食，就去向卖国军阀讨残羹剩饭，做无耻的帮凶和奴才！”他以身实践的这些话，今天读来不依然掷地有声么？
    唐朝诗人杜甫《提封》诗云：“借问悬车守，何如俭德临？”
    一个人的俭德如何，其实正是他“先天下之忧而忧”还是“先天下之乐而乐”的试金石。在这面镜子面前，人的灵魂一目了然。正因为如此，我对李大钊同志的俭德才总是备加崇敬。
    邓小平同志在最近的一次讲话中指出：
  “艰苦奋斗是我们的传统，艰苦朴素的教育今后要抓紧，一直要抓六十至七十年。我们的国家越发展，越要抓艰苦创业。”学习并且发扬光大李大钊同志的俭德，今天不是有着更巨大的现实意义么？
