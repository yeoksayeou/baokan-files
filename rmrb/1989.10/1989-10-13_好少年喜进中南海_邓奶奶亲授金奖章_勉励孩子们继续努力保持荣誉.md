Today morning, bright sunlight bathed the quiet courtyard of Zhongnanhai's Xihua Hall. "Good morning, Grandma Deng!" With a greeting, nine children gathered around Deng Yingchao, the respected figure in their hearts.

These children were nine of the "National Ten Outstanding Young Pioneers" selected by the Communist Youth League Central Committee, the National Young Pioneers Federation, and CCTV yesterday. Today, they came specially to visit Grandma Deng.

"Hello!" Looking at the children's smiling faces, 85-year-old Deng Yingchao's face lit up with a kind smile.

At just nine years old, Wu Yan, a Young Pioneer from Zhangzhou, Fujian, had already graduated from primary school and was proficient in three foreign languages. She tied a red scarf for Grandma Deng. Wu Chao, a nine-year-old Young Pioneer from Dongyang County, Zhejiang, who had obtained a national patent for his invention, presented a bouquet of flowers to Grandma Deng.

When the leaders from the Youth League, Song Defu, Liu Yandong, and Li Yuanchao, introduced the children's stories, Deng Yingchao waved her hand and said, "I know their deeds." Deng Yingchao held the children's hands and said, "In the past few days, I have read a lot of materials about your deeds. I have been thinking about you and wanted to see you. Today, I finally saw you, and I am very happy. You have done very well."

Deng Yingchao embraced Cheng Jie, a young girl from Nanjiang, Sichuan, who had lost both arms, and proudly gave her a thumbs up: "Learn from you, even those with healthy limbs should learn from you!"

The only absent member of the ten outstanding Young Pioneers today was the young hero Lai Ning, who sacrificed his life while saving his hometown from a forest fire. Deng Yingchao tightly held Lai Ning's parents' and teacher's hands and said with deep emotion, "Thank you, thank you for cultivating and educating such a good child, such an outstanding young hero for the country. He is not only your pride but also the pride of all Young Pioneers in the country. I feel sad and regretful that he couldn't come today. Although he has passed away, his deeds will be passed down from generation to generation and will be remembered forever!"

In the reception room, Deng Yingchao awarded gold medals to the nine children and Lai Ning's parents. She spoke earnestly to the children, "You have achieved results and become advanced, but how can you be a good advanced and maintain your status? You cannot have a complacent mentality, or fall behind after a couple of years. You must continue to strive. Achieving honor is not difficult, but maintaining it is. You should also help and inspire the Young Pioneers around you, inspire all 130 million Young Pioneers in the country to become advanced like you."

Deng Yingchao said, "Here, I also want to tell you that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China: You are living happily today, but you must not forget that we sacrificed 20 million people to overthrow the three mountains and establish New China. In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, our achievements have been glorious. I, as a witness, have seen with my own eyes the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people step by step towards happiness. You should know that it is not easy for the Chinese people to stand up, and it has cost a great deal. You should not forget this history."

Before the meeting ended, Deng Yingchao excitedly said, "Although I am old, my thoughts still maintain revolutionary youth. This old lady is willing to advance with you, to follow the Communist Party together, hoping that you will surpass me. The future of the country depends on you!"

    好少年喜进中南海  邓奶奶亲授金奖章
    勉励孩子们继续努力保持荣誉
    新华社北京10月12日电（记者张宿堂）今天上午明媚的阳光洒落在中南海西花厅这个宁静的院落。“邓奶奶好！”随着一声问候，九个孩子向他们心目中尊敬的邓颖超奶奶围拢过去。
    这些孩子是共青团中央、全国少工委、中央电视台昨天评选出的“全国十佳少先队员”中的九位。今天，他们是专程前来拜见邓奶奶的。
    “你们好！”望着孩子们一张张笑脸，85岁高龄的邓颖超脸上露出慈祥的笑容。
    年仅九岁就已小学毕业，并初通三国外语的福建漳州市少先队员吴燕为邓奶奶带上了红领巾。九岁就因发明创新而获得国家专利的浙江东阳县少先队员吴超把一束鲜花献给了邓颖超奶奶。
    当团中央负责人宋德福、刘延东、李源潮介绍这些孩子们的情况时，邓颖超摆摆手说：“他们的事迹我都知道了。”邓颖超拉着孩子们的手说：“这几天我看了很多有关你们事迹的材料，我一直在想着你们，想见见你们，今天终于见到了，我很高兴。你们做得很好。”
    邓颖超搂着失去双臂的四川南江小姑娘成洁疼爱而高兴地竖起了大拇指：“向你学习，手脚健全的人都应向你学习！”
    十佳少先队员今天唯一缺席的少年英雄赖宁，因扑救家乡的山林大火而献出了年轻的生命。邓颖超紧紧握着赖宁父母和老师的手，深情地说：“感谢你们，感谢你们为国家培养教育出赖宁这样的好孩子，这样了不起的少年英雄。他不仅是你们的光荣，也是全国少先队员的光荣。他今天没能来，我感到惋惜、悲痛。他虽然逝世了，但他的事迹将世世代代传下去，永垂千古！”
    在会客室里，邓颖超将一枚枚金质奖章颁发给了九个孩子和赖宁的父母。她对孩子们语重心长地说：“你们现在取得了成绩，成了先进，但怎样当好先进、保持先进呢？这就不能有骄傲自满的心理，不能过了两年就掉了队，要不断地继续努力。取得荣誉并不难，难的是如何保持荣誉。你们同时还要帮助、带动周围的少先队员，带动全国的少先队员，使全国的一亿三千万少先队员都成为你们一样的先进分子。”
    邓颖超说：“这里，我还要告诉你们的是没有共产党就没有新中国这个道理：你们今天生活得很幸福，但是不能忘记，我们是牺牲了2000万人才推翻了三座大山，建立了新中国的。建国40年来，我们的成就是辉煌的，我这个见证人是亲眼看到中国共产党领导中国人民一步步走向幸福的。你们应该知道，中国人站起来是不容易的，是付出了很大的代价的。你们不要忘记这个历史。”
    会见结束前，邓颖超激动地说：“我虽然老了，但思想仍然保持着革命的青春。我这个老太太愿意和你们一起前进，一起跟着共产党走，希望你们超过我。国家的未来靠你们！”（附图片）
