The purpose of running a business is to make money. This seems undeniable. However, Yan Yonghai, the manager of Hai Xiang Beverage Factory in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, has his own way of making money. He says, "Reputation is more valuable than money."

So, how does Yan Yonghai enhance his company's reputation?

Focusing on product quality is Yan Yonghai's first strategy for improving the company's reputation. Hai Xiang Beverage Factory is a small township enterprise with only about 120 employees. Some people say that economic performance is the lifeblood of a company. Yan Yonghai says, "Without high-quality products, where does the economic performance come from?" To improve technical standards, the factory established a product quality management leadership team, with Yan Yonghai himself as the leader, ensuring that no substandard products leave the factory. In just over three years, they have been able to produce four categories of beverages, sparkling wine, fruit juice, and canned goods, totaling more than a dozen products. After being tested by relevant departments, all chemical and physical indicators meet national standards, and the products are in high demand.

Strictly adhering to contracts is Yan Yonghai's second strategy for enhancing the company's reputation. High-quality products have helped Hai Xiang Beverage Factory establish a foothold in the increasingly competitive market, opening up new opportunities. Many units have signed supply contracts with them. Yan Yonghai strictly adheres to all signed contracts, never breaking his word. During the peak sales season for beverages, some units and individual business owners often come with cash to purchase goods, willing to pay a premium to secure the products. In such situations, Yan Yonghai never lets money cloud his judgment, always prioritizing contract holders. Sometimes, when customers urgently need goods, a telegram is all it takes, and he delivers the products to their doorstep.

Adhering to professional ethics is another strategy Yan Yonghai uses to enhance the company's reputation. He refuses to make money in any way that is unethical. Since the factory's establishment, their product prices have always been strictly determined according to relevant national regulations, never arbitrarily set. Even when raw material prices rise, they find ways to absorb the cost themselves. They would rather make less money than arbitrarily increase product prices. Last year, raw material prices surged, and some factory employees suggested Yan Yonghai slightly raise product prices, arguing that as long as the increase was lower than other factories, it wouldn't affect the product's competitiveness. Yan Yonghai did not adopt this suggestion. When that idea was rejected, others advised him: "Don't change the prices, but could we reduce the quantity of various ingredients slightly? This way, customers won't notice any issues, and the factory can minimize losses." Yan Yonghai not only refused but also required that the products be filled to 1-2 grams more than the stated weight. Over the years, despite several instances of raw material price increases, their product prices have remained stable and have not been short-weighted or adulterated. Just this one aspect has resulted in a loss of over 100,000 yuan in potential income.

The continuous improvement of the company's reputation has brought Hai Xiang Beverage Factory a large number of customers. In just over three years, more than 30 sugar and alcohol wholesale stations across the country have signed long-term supply contracts with them. In addition to providing employment for 120 surplus laborers in 9 townships in the county, they have also contributed over 100,000 yuan in various taxes to the state and collective.

    他把信誉看得比钱重
    办企业就是为了赚钱。这似乎毫无疑问。但是，山西翼城县海翔饮料厂厂长阎永海却很讲究钱的赚法。他说“信誉比钱更值钱”。
    那么，阎永海是怎样提高企业信誉的呢？
    注重产品质量，这是阎永海提高企业信誉的第一招。海翔饮料厂是一个只有120余人的小乡镇企业。有人说，经济效益是企业的生命。阎永海说：“没有高质量的产品，哪来的经济效益？”为了提高技术水平，厂里成立了产品质量管理领导小组，他亲自担任组长，绝不让一个不合格的产品出厂。短短三年多时间，他们已能生产饮料、汽酒、果汁、罐头四大类十几种产品。经有关部门化验，各项理化指标均达到了国家规定的标准，产品供不应求。
    严格信守合同，这是阎永海提高企业信誉的第二招。高质量的产品使海翔饮料厂在竞争日益激烈的市场上，站稳了脚跟，打开了局面，很多单位与他们签订了供货合同。凡是签了合同的，阎永海都严格遵守，绝不失信。饮料销售旺季，一些单位和个体户常常带着现金前来购货，为了把货弄到手，有的甚至愿意出高价。在这种情况下，阎永海从不见钱眼开，仍然优先供应签约者。有时用户需货迫切，只要拍个电报，他还送货上门。
    遵守职业道德，这是阎永海提高企业信誉的又一个招数。不该赚的钱，阎永海一分也不赚。建厂以来，他们的产品价格一直是严格按照国家有关规定核定的，从不胡来。即使在原材料涨价的情况下他们也千方百计自己消化。宁肯少赚点，也不随意提高产品价格。去年，原材料大幅度涨价，厂里一些人建议阎永海适当提高产品价格，并说只要提价幅度低于其它厂家，不会影响产品的竞争力。阎永海没有采纳。这一建议不行，另一些人又向他献计：价格别动了，能否将各种配料适当减量？这样用户既看不出什么毛病，厂里又能少受一点损失。阎永海不但没同意，反而要求产品灌装时，要比标明重量多1—2克。几年来，尽管遇到了几次原材料涨价，但他们的产品价格却一直稳定不变，并且做到了不缺斤短两，不掺杂使假。仅此一项，他们就少收入10多万元。
    企业信誉的不断提高，使海翔饮料厂盈得了大量的用户。仅仅三年多时间，全国各地的30多家糖酒批发站与他们签订了长期供货合同。除为全县9个乡镇的120余名剩余劳力找到了出路外，还为国家、集体上交各种税费10多万元。
