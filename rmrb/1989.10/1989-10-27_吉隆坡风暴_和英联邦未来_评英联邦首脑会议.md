The week-long Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) concluded on October 23 in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The meeting issued a 29-page "Final Communiqué" signed by the 49 government leaders in attendance, welcoming the improvement in East-West relations, emphasizing the need to assist developing countries still threatened by economic problems, and calling for global efforts to address issues such as drug trafficking, refugees, terrorism, regional conflicts, and environmental pollution. The meeting was considered a "success." However, on the issue of South Africa, Britain issued a separate statement opposing sanctions against South Africa, sparking a heated debate and creating what local newspapers called the "Kuala Lumpur Storm," posing new challenges to Britain's South African policy and the future of the Commonwealth.

Whether to genuinely impose sanctions on the South African apartheid regime has long been a major unresolved issue within the Commonwealth. South Africa is currently the only country in the world that practices apartheid. Since the beginning of the 20th century, it has enacted over 350 laws and regulations that discriminate based on race. South Africa was an early member of the Commonwealth but was forced to withdraw in 1961 after the Commonwealth adopted the principle of racial equality. Since then, the Commonwealth has consistently opposed apartheid. Although the British government also condemns South Africa's racist policies, it opposes comprehensive mandatory sanctions, advocating for dialogue to promote peaceful reforms within South Africa. This stance is at odds with the views of other Commonwealth member countries. Therefore, the issue of South Africa has been the most difficult problem at previous Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.

At this year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, a heated debate ensued over how to address the issue of South African apartheid. On October 22, the Commonwealth Heads of Government issued a joint statement on South Africa, calling for the maintenance and strengthening of all economic sanctions currently imposed on South Africa until South Africa implements clear and irreversible reforms. However, the statement also noted that Britain alone opposed the tightening of four specific economic sanctions. It is reported that Britain, unable to articulate its position in the joint statement, took the unprecedented step of issuing a separate statement two hours later. The statement rejected the strengthening of existing sanctions, arguing that "South Africa has made significant and positive reforms," and that the Commonwealth should "encourage" such reforms rather than "further punish" them, as "sanctions will cause poverty and tragedy in South Africa."

Britain's stance against sanctioning the South African apartheid regime drew strong opposition from the 48 other government leaders of the Commonwealth. It is recalled that the Commonwealth had sent the "Wise Men's Group" to South Africa for "peaceful persuasion," and the European Community had dispatched Britain's former Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe on a "peace mission," but neither effort was successful. The "Wise Men's Group" concluded that only economic sanctions could force the South African government to change its course. The *Times* noted that while the South African government had recently released eight black leaders, the situation had indeed "changed," but "Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal has long doubted Mr. de Klerk's intentions." Britain's position has been widely criticized, and Prime Minister Thatcher has been more isolated than ever. Zimbabwean President Mugabe criticized Thatcher's actions as "contemptible and unacceptable," saying that Britain's stance was tantamount to "supporting South African apartheid." Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney stated that, given Britain's position, "South Africa has thanked Britain, and this fact is already clear." Some British politicians also criticized the government's South African policy, with some sharply accusing the government of playing the role of a "Trojan Horse" for South Africa at the Kuala Lumpur meeting.

However, Thatcher remained steadfast in her position. At a press conference before the meeting's conclusion, she said: "If it's 48 to 1 on the issue of South Africa, then I regret the 48 votes." She denied that Britain was more isolated than ever, stating that compared to the 1985 Nassau meeting, the debate at the Kuala Lumpur meeting was merely a "storm in a teacup." Thatcher's reluctance to impose comprehensive economic sanctions on South Africa, aside from South Africa's strategic importance and traditional historical ties with Britain, is due to the fact that Britain has significant economic interests in South Africa. Statistics show that Britain is South Africa's second-largest trading partner; South Africa is one of the countries where Britain has the most overseas investments, with British direct and indirect investments in South Africa exceeding $14 billion, accounting for 10% of its overseas investments.

Local opinion holds that the Kuala Lumpur meeting has widened the gap between Britain and other Commonwealth member countries, threatening the "unity" of the Commonwealth, although other member countries have become closer. The Commonwealth exists solely due to historical ties formed between the former British Empire and its self-governing dominions and colonies. The Commonwealth has been seeking a more hopeful basis for its existence for over 40 years. For many member countries, uniting to oppose racism is currently their central task. For Britain, although it has always regarded the Commonwealth as a pillar supporting its status as a great power, and as one of the three pillars of its "three-circle diplomacy," the political and economic importance of the Commonwealth to Britain is now far less than that of the "special relationship with the United States" and the European Community. It is not yet clear whether the Commonwealth countries will disintegrate over this dispute, but the sharp divisions over the South African issue pose a challenge to the future of the Commonwealth.

### “吉隆坡风暴”和英联邦未来——评英联邦首脑会议

　　“吉隆坡风暴”和英联邦未来
　　——评英联邦首脑会议
　　本报记者　陈特安
    为期一周的英联邦首脑会议23日在马来西亚首都吉隆坡闭幕。会议发表与会49国政府首脑共同签署的、长达29页的会议“最后公报”，欢迎东西方关系的改善，指出有必要帮助依然受到经济问题威胁的发展中国家，呼吁作出全球性努力，以对付诸如贩毒、难民、恐怖主义、地区冲突、环境污染等全球性问题，被认为是一次“成功”的会议。但在南非问题上，英国独自发表反对制裁南非的声明，从而引发了一场激烈的争吵，形成这里报刊所说的“吉隆坡的风暴”，给英国的南非政策、英联邦的未来带来了新的考验。
    要不要真正制裁南非种族主义政权，一直是英联邦难以解决的一大症结。南非是目前世界上唯一推行种族隔离制度的国家。本世纪初以来颁布的种族歧视法律、法令多达350多项。南非本是英联邦早期成员，1961年因英联邦通过种族平等原则后被迫退出，此后英联邦一直举着反对种族隔离的旗帜。英国政府虽也谴责南非种族主义政策，但它反对全面强制性制裁，主张通过对话，促进南非内部和平改革。这与英联邦其它成员国存在明显分歧。因而，南非问题也成了前几次英联邦首脑会议头号棘手的难题。
    在本届英联邦首脑会议上，围绕着如何对待南非种族主义的问题，展开了激烈的争吵。22日，英联邦首脑会议就南非问题发表联合声明，呼吁保持和加强英联邦目前对南非采取的所有经济制裁，直到南非采取明确的、不可逆转的改革为止，但声明还指出英国单独反对加紧经济制裁的四项具体办法。据说，英国由于没有可能在联合声明中阐明其立场，故在两小时后又采取了前所未有的行动，单独发表声明。“声明”拒绝加强现存的制裁措施，其理由是，“南非已进行了重要而积极的改革”，英联邦应“鼓励”这种改革，而不是“进一步惩罚”，“制裁会造成南非的贫困和悲剧”。
    英国反对制裁南非种族主义政权的立场引起了英联邦其它48国政府首脑的强烈反对。人们记得，英联邦曾派出“贤哲小组”到南非进行“和平劝说”，欧洲共同体也派出英国前外交大臣杰弗里·豪去执行“和平使命”，但都未能奏效，“贤哲小组”得出的结论是：只有实行经济制裁才能迫使南非当局改弦易辙。《泰晤士报》认为，最近南非当局释放了8位黑人领导人，情况确实有了“变化”，但“英联邦秘书长什里达思·兰法尔先生一直怀疑德克勒克先生的意图”。英国的立场已遭到广泛的批评，撒切尔夫人空前孤立。津巴布韦总统穆加贝批评撒切尔夫人的行为是“令人看不起和不能接受的”，英国立场无异于在“支持南非种族主义”。加拿大总理马尔罗尼说，鉴于英国的立场，“南非已向英国道谢，这一事实已很清楚”。英国国内一些政治家也对政府的南非政策持批评态度，有的尖锐地指责政府在吉隆坡会议上扮演了南非的“特洛伊木马”的角色。
    然而，撒切尔夫人坚持己见。她在会议结束前的一次记者招待会上说：在南非问题上“如果是48票对一票，那么，我对48票表示非常遗憾”。她否认英国受到从未有过的孤立，她说，与1985年拿骚会议相比，吉隆坡会议上的争吵只不过是“茶杯里的风暴”。撒切尔夫人不愿对南非实行全面经济制裁，除了南非战略地位重要、同英国有着传统的历史联系外，更深一层的原因是英国在南非有着巨大的经济利益，统计表明，英国是南非第二大贸易伙伴；南非是英国在海外投资最多的国家之一，英国在南非直接和间接投资达140亿美元以上，占其海外投资的10％。
    此间舆论认为，吉隆坡会议使英国与英联邦其它成员国的鸿沟扩大了，英联邦的“团结”受到威胁，当然英联邦其它成员国则更为接近了。英联邦之所以存在，完全是由于昔日英帝国及其自治领和殖民地之间历史形成的联系。英联邦成立40多年，一直在寻求一种更有希望的存在的根据。对于许多成员国来说，它们把联合反对种族主义作为目前的中心任务，对英国来说，尽管它一直把英联邦作为支撑其大国地位的支柱之一，是它的“三环外交”中的一环，但从政治和经济上看，英联邦现在对英国的重要性已远远低于“英美特殊关系”和欧洲共同体。目前还看不出英联邦各国为这场争吵而趋于解体，但是南非问题上的尖锐分歧对英联邦的命运提出了挑战。
