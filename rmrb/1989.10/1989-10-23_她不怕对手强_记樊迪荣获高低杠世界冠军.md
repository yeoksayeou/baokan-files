The 16-year-old Shanghai girl Fan Di scored a perfect 10 in the uneven bars final at the Stuttgart World Gymnastics Championships, indisputably winning the world champion title. This is the 20th gold medal won by Chinese women's gymnastics in major international competitions since Ma Yanhong. Victory is like a refreshing spring breeze, blowing into the Chinese women's gymnastics stage, which has been struggling in a low ebb for a few years.

In the uneven bars final, Fan Di was the fourth to compete. Her routine included a split jump mount, a large circle turn 180 degrees followed by a front large circle, a front flip, a 180-degree straddle mount, a Tkachev release, a large circle turn 360 degrees, and a tucked double back dismount. She moved lightly and gracefully, weaving in and out of the two bars, creating a sense of both danger and elegance. When she landed firmly from the bars, the 7,000 spectators erupted in prolonged, enthusiastic applause. The judges almost immediately gave her a perfect 10 without hesitation.

Fan Di is a beautiful Jiangnan girl, born in 1973 in Shanghai to a family of teachers. She was agile from a young age and loved to jump around. While attending Xingfu Road Primary School, she was spotted by a coach from the amateur sports school and began training in gymnastics. In late 1984, she was transferred to the national team, initially coached by Guo Jiahong and Ren Chenghua, and later guided by Huang Yubin, Yang Qinghua, Wang Guiping, and Pan Chenfei. Two years ago, in the Rotterdam Grand Prix in the Netherlands, she also received a perfect 10. She told the reporter, "Coming to Stuttgart, I just wanted to perform well. During the team competition, I watched the Soviet and Romanian athletes and felt that they were not insurmountable. Today, I was a bit nervous, but I was not afraid."

Training in gymnastics is tough, and she has had thoughts of quitting. However, her parents and coaches always told her, "No matter what you do, once you start, do it well!"

Fan Di enjoys reading and listening to music. When asked about her future plans, she said she hadn't thought that far ahead, and for now, she is focused on training, especially strengthening her weaker areas in the floor exercise.

　　她不怕对手强
　　——记樊迪荣获高低杠世界冠军
　　本报记者　江建国
    16岁的上海姑娘樊迪在斯图加特世界体操锦标赛高低杠决赛中获得满分，无可争辩地赢得世界冠军称号。这是我国女子体操继马艳红之后的第20块世界大赛金牌。胜利像一股清新的春风，吹进了在低谷中徘徊了几年的我国女子体操舞台。
    在高低杠决赛中，樊迪第4个出场。她的这套动作是分腿跳上，大回环转体180度接向前大回环，前空翻，180度穿杠前上，再接托卡切夫腾越、大回环转体360度，团身两周下。只见她身轻如燕，绕着两根杠子飞出飞进，若即若离，惊险，舒展，优美。当她稳稳地从杠上飞身落下时，7000名观众爆发出长时间热烈掌声。几个裁判几乎没有犹豫，一致给予10分。
    樊迪是个漂亮的江南姑娘，1973年生于上海的一个教师之家。她从小身躯灵活，喜欢蹦蹦跳跳。在幸福路小学上学时被业余体校的老师相中，练上了体操。1984年底调入国家队，先由郭家鸿、任承华教练辅导，后又得到黄玉斌、杨庆华、王桂萍、潘辰飞等教练指导。两年前在荷兰鹿特丹大赛中，她也得到过一次10分。她对记者说：“来到斯图加特，我就想好好发挥。团体赛时，我看了苏联、罗马尼亚选手的比赛，觉得也并不是高不可攀。今天上场有点紧张，可不害怕。”
    练体操是苦事，她也动过不想干了的念头。可是她的父母、教练总对她说：“不论干什么，干上了就干好它！”
    樊迪喜欢看书，喜欢听音乐。问她将来的打算，她说还没想那么多，眼下还是练体操，特别是加强自由体操的薄弱环节。
