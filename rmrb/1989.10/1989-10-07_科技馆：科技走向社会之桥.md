The science and technology museums mentioned here include science halls, science palaces, science and technology activity centers, and youth science and technology activity centers. They are fundamental facilities and effective forms for carrying out various types of science popularization education. In China, science and technology museums also combine science and technology training, consultation services, domestic and international science and technology cooperation and exchanges, science and technology fellowship, and necessary living services, becoming multifunctional, comprehensive, and socially-oriented "science and technology homes" and "homes for science and technology workers."

As a social science, culture, and education facility, science and technology museums not only disseminate scientific knowledge and technological achievements but also nurture new inventions and scientific knowledge. They represent a country's and a nation's scientific and cultural quality and reflect the level of awareness in developing science and culture.

Science and technology museums have irreplaceable unique values: Firstly, they quickly provide society with vivid physical objects through exhibits to explain and teach the latest scientific knowledge, striving to synchronize the content of popular education with the new developments in science and technology. Secondly, some exhibits, through easy-to-understand demonstrations and hands-on experiences, can help the audience gain some scientific principles and application technology knowledge in a relaxed and enjoyable environment. Thirdly, they integrate scientific, knowledge-based, and entertaining elements, which can inspire and stimulate people's interest and inspiration in exploring science and technology. Fourthly, due to the wide range of exhibition content, timely changes, large visitor flow, and broad educational reach, the social impact is significant. Science and technology museums are bridges for the mutual promotion of science, economy, and society.

Since the first natural history museum in France was established in 1742, the science and technology museum industry has developed for about 250 years. After World War II, especially in the past 20 years, with the rapid development of the economy, science and technology have deeply penetrated into various fields of human activity and are increasingly playing the role of the primary productive force. The science and technology museum industry has rapidly developed in most developed countries and many developing countries.

The development of China's science and technology museum industry began after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. From 1980 to the end of 1988, more than 200 science and technology museums have been built or are under construction nationwide. Of course, according to relevant statistics, China is still one of the countries with relatively backward science and technology museum construction. For example, in terms of the average number of people covered by each science and technology museum, West Germany is 780,000, the United States is 1.14 million, Japan is 1.28 million, Bulgaria is 2.96 million, Romania is 5.58 million, Egypt is 6 million, and China is 41 million. This shows that China is not only behind developed countries but also behind some third-world countries. Nevertheless, the already completed science and technology museums have carried out many science popularization education activities. According to statistics, nationwide, 4,032 science popularization exhibitions, more than 200,000 science popularization lectures, 90,000 screenings of science and education films and videos, 23,000 science popularization galleries, and nearly 100,000 science popularization publicity days have been held. The Shanghai Science Hall receives an average of more than 5,000 visitors per day, organizes various science and technology activities, and frequently hosts foreign scholars for academic exchanges. The Yuanjiang Science and Technology Museum in Hunan often holds science and technology training classes for farmers, training more than 200 agricultural technicians in hemp cultivation for 9 provinces.

The science and technology museums in Liaoning, Jilin, and Hubei provinces have developed rapidly, and their science popularization activities are also quite effective. There are already 11 science and technology museums in 13 prefecture-level cities in Liaoning Province; 25 counties in Jilin Province have built science and technology museums; Hubei Province plans to allocate 60 million yuan from local finances by 1990 for the construction of county-level science and technology museums. Currently, 3 county science and technology museums have been completed and put into use, and 17 county science and technology museums are under construction.

The view that science and technology museums only have inputs without outputs is shortsighted. The trend of modernization in science and technology requires science and technology workers to break through the information barriers formed by the rapid division of disciplines, and science and technology museums are good places for science and technology workers to inspire each other and for scientific research categories to integrate with each other.

In addition, science and technology museums often use vivid and illustrative methods to exhibit the complex principles of new technologies, which is very beneficial for cultivating the observation abilities of young people and improving their scientific and technological literacy. Science and technology museums combined with other educational forms are conducive to forming a relatively complete modern social education system in China.

The achievements and contributions of science and technology museums cannot be simply measured by a few economic indicators, but this does not mean that science and technology museums do not need to strengthen management to strive for and improve economic benefits. China's science and technology museum industry started late and developed slowly. Some provinces and cities still do not have a single science and technology museum. Currently, most science and technology museums face the problems of financial difficulties and a shortage of talents. Solving these problems requires the attention of relevant government departments, and it also requires the support of all sectors of society, following the principle of "taking from the people and using for the people." A considerable part of the construction funds for the Heilongjiang Provincial Science Hall and the Taian Science Hall in Shandong Province came from donations from factories, mines, enterprises, and some specialized households. With the development of the situation, it is believed that more and more factories, mines, and specialized households that have made fortunes through science and technology will be willing to make their own contributions to the science and technology museum industry. Of course, there are also things that do not require much money to accomplish. For example, the Beijing Science Hall was built in 1962, but its ownership belongs to the Friendship Hotel, and the Chinese Association for Science and Technology has the right to use it, but it has to pay hundreds of thousands of yuan in rent each year, which is a heavy economic burden for the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, a mass organization without revenue. Someone suggested changing the affiliation, which would not affect the economic benefits of the Friendship Hotel much, but it would lift a heavy economic burden for the Chinese Association for Science and Technology. It is not known whether the relevant departments can study this suggestion?

With the completion of a large number of science and technology museums, the number of science and technology museum staff has been increasing, and currently, there are more than 5,000 people, which is a considerable team. If most of this team are not professional talents or lack scientific and technological professional knowledge, but are seeking a relaxed and comfortable job here, it will affect the functioning of the science and technology museums and reduce the efficiency and service quality of the science and technology museums. This is worth noting.

    科技馆：科技走向社会之桥
    本报记者　赵相如
    这里所说的科技馆，包括科学会堂、科学宫、科技活动中心、青少年科技活动中心等，是开展多种形式科学普及教育的基础设施和有效形式。在我国，科技馆还把科技培训、咨询服务、国内外科技合作交流、科技联谊以及必要的生活服务结合在一起，成为多功能、综合性、面向社会的“科技之家”、“科技工作者之家”。
    作为社会性的科技、文化、教育设施，科技馆既传播科技知识与科技成果，又孕育新的发明和新的科技知识。它标志着一个国家、一个民族的科学文化素质，反映出其发展科学文化的觉悟程度。
    科技馆具有不可替代的特殊价值：首先，它通过展品，迅速向社会提供生动的实体来说明和传授最新科学知识，力求做到普及教育的内容和科学技术的新发展同步。其次，一部分展品通过深入浅出的演示和亲自动手体验，可以使观众在轻松愉快的环境中获得一些科学原理和应用技术知识。第三，它把科学性、知识性、趣味性聚为一体，可以启迪和诱发人们探索科技的兴趣和灵感。第四，由于展出内容广泛、变化及时，人流量大，受教育面广，因而社会影响较大。科技馆是科技、经济、社会相互交融促进的桥梁。
    从1742年法国自然历史博物馆最先在人类历史上诞生时算起，世界上科技馆事业发展已有250年左右的历史。第二次世界大战以后，特别是近20年，随着经济的高速发展，科学技术已深入到人类活动的各个领域，日益发挥着第一生产力的作用，科技馆事业在大部分发达国家和许多发展中国家迅猛发展。
    我国科技馆事业的发展是在党的十一届三中全会之后。从1980年到1988年底，全国已建和在建的科技馆达200余座。当然，根据有关资料统计，我国在科技馆建设方面仍然是世界上比较落后的国家之一，如按每座科技馆平均覆盖的人数来看，西德为78万人，美国为114万人，日本为128万人，保加利亚为296万人，罗马尼亚为558万人，埃及为600万人，我国为4100万人。这说明不但落后于发达国家，也落后于一些第三世界国家。尽管如此，已建成的科技馆仍然开展了许多科普教育工作。据统计，全国共举办科普展览4032次，科普报告会20余万次，放映科教电影、录像9万场次，举办科普画廊2.3万次，开展了近10万个科普宣传日活动。上海科学会堂平均每天接待5000余人次，举办各种科技活动，还经常接待国外学者进行学术交流。湖南沅江市科技馆经常举办以农民为对象的科技培训班，已为9个省培养苎麻栽培的农民技术员200多人。
    辽宁、吉林、湖北3省科技馆建设发展较快，因而科普活动开展也比较有实效。辽宁省13个省辖市中已有11个建有科技馆；吉林省有25个县建了科技馆；湖北省决定到1990年从地方财政中拨款600万元用于县级科技馆的建设。目前已有3个县科技馆竣工交付使用，17个县的科技馆正在施工中。
    那种认为科技馆只有投入没有产出的观点是短视的。现代科学技术的综合化趋势要求科技工作者去突破由于学科急剧分化所形成的信息壁垒，而科技馆正是科技工作者相互启迪、科研门类相互交融的良好场所。
    此外，科技馆常以深入浅出的形象化手段展出新技术的复杂原理，这对培养青少年的观察能力，提高他们的科技素质是大有裨益的。科技馆与其它教育形式相结合，有利于构成我国较为完整的现代化社会教育体系。
    衡量科技馆的成绩和贡献大小，自然不能简单地看几项经济指标，但这不等于说对科技馆就不需要加强管理，以争取和提高经济效益。我国科技馆事业起步晚，发展还不快，有的省市至今还没有一个科技馆。目前多数科技馆面临经费拮据、人才短缺的状况。解决这些问题需要政府有关部门的关心，同时本着“取之于民、用之于民”的办法，也需要社会各界的支持。黑龙江省科学会堂和山东泰安市科学会堂的建设资金中，就有相当部分是厂矿企业和一些专业户捐赠的。随着形势的发展，相信会有越来越多的依靠科技发家致富的厂矿、专业户会乐意对科技馆事业作出自己力所能及的奉献。当然，还有些事不花多少钱就可以办到。比如北京科学会堂建于1962年，但它的所有权却属于友谊宾馆，中国科协有使用权，只是每年要拿出上百万元的租金，这对科协这个没有创收的群众团体来说，实在是一个不小的负担。有人建议把隶属关系改变一下，对友谊宾馆来说并不影响多少经济效益，对中国科协来说，却卸掉很沉的一个经济包袱。这个建议不知有关部门可否研究一下？
    随着一大批科技馆的建成，科技馆工作人员便不断增加，据统计目前已达5000余人，这自然是一支数量可观的队伍。如果这支队伍的多数不是专业人才或缺乏科技专业知识，只是到此来谋求轻松、舒适的职业，那将会影响科技馆功能的发挥，降低科技馆的效率和服务质量。这是值得注意的。
