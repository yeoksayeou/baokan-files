Li Peng, the Premier, has recently instructed multiple times that the cleanup and rectification of companies should start from the central state organs and the companies managed by the State Council and various ministries, setting an example for the entire nation.

For this purpose, Ro Gan, the Secretary-General of the State Council, announced today at a meeting with leaders from 110 departments and major companies under the central state organs that the national leading group for the cleanup and rectification of companies has decided to immediately dispatch 13 inspection teams to assist in the work at 17 companies affiliated with some departments under the central state organs.

It is understood that these 13 inspection teams are led by the Supervision Bureau, the Audit Office, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, with other relevant departments participating. Additionally, some representatives of the National People's Congress, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and members of democratic parties have been invited to join the work.

Besides, three inspection teams composed of members from the National People's Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and democratic parties will start inspecting and guiding the cleanup and rectification of companies in various departments under the central state organs from November.

Ro Gan pointed out that the cleanup and rectification of companies is one of the seven major tasks decided by the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, and investigating and handling illegal and disciplinary issues and cases is an important basic task in the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to further clean up and rectify companies. Currently, this work has become a major political issue of great concern to all sectors of society and the people, directly relating to the prestige of the Party and the government.

Ro Gan revealed that recently, the leaders responsible for handling cases from the Supervision Bureau, the Audit Office, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the Office for the Comprehensive Financial and Tax Inspection have jointly analyzed and studied the cases and clues of companies affiliated with central state organs that have been grasped and are being handled. Among them, the cases with relatively complex case circumstances and chaotic financial systems are concentrated in a few large companies.

He emphasized that currently, focusing on handling the problems and cases of companies affiliated with these few departments will play a driving role in the investigation and handling of illegal and disciplinary issues in central state organs and even nationwide.

In analyzing the current obstacles and difficulties in handling major cases, Ro Gan believes that they are mainly manifested in "five fears," "five difficulties," and "five non-investigations." The "five fears" are: fear that the upper level's determination is not strong, policies change, and it is difficult to back down from a situation; fear that the interests of departments and units will be affected, and they will be criticized from all sides; fear of affecting relationships and offending people, making future work difficult; fear of affecting personal achievements, making it hard to explain; and fear of causing aftereffects, leading to long-term entanglements.

The "five difficulties" refer to the difficulties in exposing and reporting, investigating and gathering evidence, handling cases, processing cases, and assigning responsibilities to individuals. As a result, it leads to "five non-investigations": investigating outside but not inside, investigating below but not above, investigating small cases but not large ones, investigating incidents but not people, investigating known cases but not hidden ones.

It is understood that Vice Premier Tian Jiyun has repeatedly emphasized the need to organize forces to concentrate on handling a batch of serious illegal and disciplinary issues and cases, as well as related people and incidents, with a focus on major cases, to promote the overall work of cleaning up and rectifying companies. At the same time, he pointed out that in the process of merging and handling companies and cases, one should have the spirit of not fearing to offend people for the sake of the Party and the country's interests.

At today's meeting, Ro Gan also put forward specific requirements for handling major cases in companies. He hopes that all departments and units will fully mobilize the masses to do a good job in exposing and reporting; strengthen policy propaganda and legal education, vigorously implement the _Notice_ from the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the _Notification_ from the Supervision Bureau, and encourage those with problems to take the path of confessing and being lenient.

### 罗干部署中央国家机关进一步清理整顿公司  派检查组进驻十七家公司帮有关部门查处大案要案

    罗干部署中央国家机关进一步清理整顿公司
    派检查组进驻十七家公司帮有关部门查处大案要案
    本报北京十月十九日讯　记者毛磊报道：李鹏总理最近多次指示，清理整顿公司首先从中央国家机关做起，从国务院和各部委管理的公司做起，为全国做出表率。
    为此，国务院秘书长罗干今天在中央国家机关一百一十个部门和总公司领导同志会议上宣布，全国清理整顿公司领导小组决定，立即派出十三个检查组，到中央国家机关一些部门所属的十七家公司帮助工作。
    据悉，这十三个检查组分别由监察部、审计署、国家工商局牵头，其他有关部门参加，同时还邀请了部分全国人大代表、全国政协委员和民主党派人士一起工作。
    除此之外，还由全国人大、全国政协、各民主党派人士组成三个巡视组，从十一月份起，分别到中央国家机关各部门检查、指导清理整顿公司工作。
    罗干指出，清理整顿公司是中央政治局决定要抓好的七件大事之一，查处违法违纪问题和案件，是党中央、国务院关于进一步清理整顿公司的决定中一项重要的基本任务。现在这项工作已成为社会各方面和人民群众十分关注的重大政治问题，直接关系到党和政府的威信。
    罗干透露，最近监察部、审计署、国家工商局、财务税收大检查办公室负责查处案件的领导同志，共同分析、研究了已经掌握和正在查处的中央国家机关所属公司的案件和线索，其中案情比较复杂、财务制度比较混乱的集中在少数几家大公司。
    他强调，当前集中力量抓好这几个部门所属公司问题和案件的查处工作，将会对中央国家机关以至全国查处公司违法违纪工作起到推动作用。
    在分析当前查处重大案件的阻力和困难时，罗干认为主要表现为“五怕”、“五难”和“五不查”。“五怕”是：一怕上面的决心不大，政策变化，骑虎难下；二怕部门、单位利益受损失，遭到各方责难；三怕影响关系、得罪人，将来工作难办；四怕影响自己政绩，难以说清；五怕出现后遗症，长期纠缠不清。
      “五难”指的是，揭发举报难，调查取证难，办案手段难，案件处理难，责任到人难。结果便造成“五查五不查”：查外不查内，查下不查上，查小不查大，查事不查人，查明不查暗。
    据了解，田纪云副总理曾多次强调，要组织力量，集中查处一批严重违法乱纪的问题和案件，以及有关的人和事，重点是大案要案，以此来推动整个清理整顿公司的工作。同时他还指出，在撤并公司和查处案件中，要有为了党和国家利益不怕得罪人的精神。
    在今天的会议上，罗干还对查处公司重大案件提出了具体要求，他希望各部门、各单位要充分发动群众，认真做好揭发举报工作；加强政策宣传和法制教育，大力贯彻最高人民法院、最高人民检察院的《通告》和监察部的《通知》，促使有问题的人走坦白从宽的道路。
