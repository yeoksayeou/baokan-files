A Fair Evaluation

During my visit to Hong Kong and Macau, a banker told me, “The Bank of China Group used to be quite conservative, but in recent years, it has been innovative and its image has greatly improved. It is now recognized as the second-largest bank group in Hong Kong, second only to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. It has substantial financial resources and good credit. The Bank of China's Macau branch is the largest bank in Macau. The development of the Bank of China Group has become a hot topic frequently reported by local newspapers.”

Hearing is not as good as seeing. I specifically looked through the relevant reports in Hong Kong newspapers over the past two years and visited several branches of the Bank of China Group. I deeply felt that this assessment is true.

Look at the large headlines published in several Hong Kong newspapers in prominent positions:

“Becoming another kingdom in the banking industry, the Bank of China Group is actively advancing,” “The Bank of China Group’s power is unstoppable,” “Chinese-funded banks diversify operations,” “Business focus on Hong Kong, the Bank of China Group grows ideally,” “The soaring Bank of China Tower (referring to the 70-story building soon to be completed) symbolizes power, the Bank of China Group is vigorously developing Hong Kong’s foundation.” The media evaluation is indeed high.

A Hong Kong reporter wrote:

“Today, although it is not said to have undergone earth-shaking changes, with the bright and new business halls, people have seen smiling faces and friendly greetings. More importantly, efficiency has improved and the range of services has expanded, and praise from customers has increased.” On March 2, 1989, a Hong Kong newspaper reported under the title “The Bank of China Group launches ‘Foreign Exchange Treasure,’ diversified services further advanced,” stating: “The Bank of China Group, based on its strong foundation, takes serving the public as its mission, and sincerely provides diversified services to the broad masses of citizens.”

Indeed, “taking serving the public as its mission” and “developing Hong Kong’s foundation,” as Huang Teshui, the Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Management Office of the Bank of China, said: “Rooted here, serving here,” this is why the Bank of China Group was able to stand firm in the unprecedented run on the bank in June. The Bank of China, which has been operating in Hong Kong for 70 years (the youngest of its sister banks has also been operating for over 30 years), has deeply rooted itself in the economic body of Hong Kong and Macau. The 14 banks of the Bank of China Group, with nearly 300 branches, are scattered throughout Hong Kong, Kowloon, the New Territories, and Macau. The Bank of China Group is like a main artery in an organism, and the economy of Hong Kong and Macau cannot do without it. Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People’s Republic, especially in the 10 years since the reform and opening up, it has been busy ensuring the smooth circulation of the economic blood of Hong Kong and Macau, and serving the public, promoting the prosperity and stability of the economy of Hong Kong and Macau.

What Others Don’t Have, We Do; What Others Have, We Innovate

Modernization, diversification, and internationalization—three wheels turning together, unwaveringly serving the public. In this international financial center of Hong Kong, banks are numerous and competitive. Now, if you walk into any branch of the Bank of China Group, you will see obvious improvements in its facade, internal facilities, operational efficiency, and business quality. This is the result of their recent efforts to improve. The new computer center of the Bank of China, which was completed and put into use last year at a huge cost, is currently the largest in scale and most advanced in equipment among Hong Kong banks. Modern computer networking allows you to open an account in one branch, and you will have an account in all 13 banks and nearly 300 branches, allowing you to withdraw and deposit money anywhere. The business volume of deposits, loans, remittances, insurance, credit cards, agency buying and selling of gold, stocks, and other services is continuously growing, all provided by computers with fast and accurate services; more than 700 “BankNet” automatic teller machines scattered throughout the streets, in addition to serving the group, are also connected with more than 30 other banks. Modern facilities have created conditions for diversified and internationalized business, high-quality service, and economic efficiency.

“What others don’t have, we do; what others have, we innovate.” The Bank of China provides diversified financial services according to the different needs of customers. There are counter services, hall services, telephone services, door-to-door services, and mail services. Automatic renewal of time deposits, the bank can automatically renew at maturity, customers are exempt from procedures, and can avoid interest loss. The “Foreign Exchange Treasure” launched in the first quarter of this year, one passbook can handle up to 18 kinds of foreign currency deposits, customers do not need to carry multiple passbooks. In some branch business halls, you can often see customers watching the foreign exchange rates on the computer terminal screen, and they will decide to convert from one currency to another according to the market conditions. Customers are very welcome to this “Foreign Exchange Treasure.” For example, the housing installment loans provided by the Bank of China Group have a term of up to 20 years, supporting citizens to live and work in peace. Now, the total amount of loans provided by the Bank of China for citizens to purchase residential and other buildings has exceeded 30 billion Hong Kong dollars. “Jewels are born in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories.” One of the members of the Bank of China Group, the Jewelry Bank, is an authoritative bank in Hong Kong for agency operations of precious metals. It is not satisfied with a single precious metal business and is determined to make itself a financial supermarket. Customers coming here are like entering a department store or supermarket, where they can freely “shop.”

Foreign trade and manufacturing are the lifeblood of Hong Kong’s economy. Therefore, trade financing and industrial loans are also the focus of the Bank of China Group’s business development. In recent years, the Bank of China Group’s trade financing business has grown the most. Industrial loans have increased from more than 3,000 in 1983 to more than 16,000 in 1988. The Bank of China has also provided large loans to Hong Kong’s major public utilities such as the underwater tunnel, subway, and power plant. It is particularly worth mentioning that: in the 10 years since the reform and opening up, the Bank of China has supported a large number of Hong Kong and Macau businessmen to go to the vast mainland to explore and make money. Isn’t it a win-win situation? It is beneficial to Hong Kong and Macau investors, beneficial to the prosperity of the economy of Hong Kong and Macau, and beneficial to the construction of the mainland. The Bank of China Group has provided financing of more than 18 billion Hong Kong dollars for Hong Kong and Macau businessmen to invest in the mainland and engage in “three-in-one” and “compensatory trade” in the past 10 years.

All in all, not to mention the Bank of China Group’s participation in the “rescue market” activities during the bank and stock market turmoil in Hong Kong, isn’t this the best proof that the Bank of China Group is indeed a member of Hong Kong and Macau society and is sincerely working hard for the stability and prosperity of the economy of Hong Kong and Macau?

“The Bank of China is Our Own Enterprise”

The Bank of China Group has many local employees. Whether it is the old generation of bankers or young employees, they all proudly say: “The Bank of China is our own enterprise.”

Among the more than 13,000 employees, the personnel sent by the mainland to the Bank of China Group account for only about 1%. The localization of the workforce, the high-level and mid-level management personnel of each sister bank are mostly selected from local people, which has greatly enhanced the cohesion and centripetal force within the Bank of China Group. Local people working here all feel comfortable. The most obvious points are two: the interpersonal relationships here are equal, “junior clerks” and “senior managers” have different positions but no distinction of nobility, and personal dignity is fully respected; another point is the sense of belonging of Chinese people, compatriots are like brothers, and they are like a family. This is why they are so patriotic and loyal to the bank, standing firm at their posts and weathering the storm together during the run on the bank in June. Because they know best who the Bank of China Group is working hard for, and all the work of the Bank of China Group is condensed with their blood, wisdom, and labor. Their explanations and persuasion to customers are also the most convincing.

The integration of water and milk is not only reflected within the organization but also in social life. In recent years, the Bank of China Group has paid great attention to improving its social image and actively participated in and supported social welfare activities. For example, the Bank of China has been the sole sponsor of the Hong Kong Bank of China Cup International Athletics “Gold Mile” Invitational for four consecutive years, the sole sponsor of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce’s selection of young entrepreneurs, participation in the Million Dollar Walk for Charity, the International Dragon Boat Race, and so on. Huang Teshui said well:

“As a bank rooted in Hong Kong and Macau, to be recognized by Hong Kong and Macau society, we must do our best to contribute to the development of the local society and integrate with the local social life.” This is exactly what they are doing.

It is gratifying that more and more people in Hong Kong and Macau have come to realize: disrupting the Bank of China Group is disrupting the financial system of Hong Kong and Macau. The deposits absorbed by the Bank of China are taken from Hong Kong, and most of them are used in Hong Kong. Recently, the deposits of the Bank of China Group have shown a significant rebound. Many business enterprises and citizens have returned their deposits or requested the Bank of China to provide various services. More than 10,000 employees of the Bank of China system are opening up new situations with new attitudes.

    服务大众志不渝
    ——港澳中银集团见闻
    本报记者　计泓赓
    公正的评价
    在港澳采访期间，有位银行界人士对我说：“港澳中银集团过去偏于‘保守’，近几年开拓创新，形象大为改观，已经是这里公认的仅次于汇丰的香港第二大银行集团。资力厚，信誉好。中国银行澳门分行更是澳门一家最大的银行。中银集团的发展动向已成为这里报刊经常报道的热门话题。”
    耳听为虚，眼见为实。我特意翻了翻近两年香港报刊有关报道，又去中银集团几个银行转了转，深感此话不假。
    请看香港多家报纸曾发表在显著地位的大字标题：
    “成为银行界另一王国，中银集团积极进取”，“中银势力锐不可当”，“中资银行经营多元化”，“业务重点集中本港，中银集团增长理想”，“高耸入云中银新厦（按：指即将完工的70层大厦）势力象征，中银集团锐意发展港建根基”……舆论评价可谓高矣。
    香港一位记者写道：
    “今天，虽说不上已有翻天覆地的变化，但配合明亮一新的营业大堂，人们已看到一张张笑脸和亲切的招呼，更重要的是效率快了和服务项目多了，受客户赞扬多了。”今年3月2日，香港某报在题为“中银集团推出‘外汇宝’，多元化服务更进一步”的报道中，开头就说：“中银集团向以雄厚之实力为基础，服务大众为己任，竭诚为广大市民提供多元化服务。”
    不错，“以服务大众为己任”“发展港建根基”，正如中国银行港澳管理处主任黄涤岩说的：“根植于斯，服务于斯”，这是中银集团为什么能在今年6月一场空前的挤提风暴中立于不败之地一个深层次的因素。在香港开业已有70年历史的中国银行（其他姊妹行最年轻的也都有30年以上历史），已深深根植于港澳经济这个大有机体中。中银集团的14家银行，近300家分支行遍布香港、九龙、新界、澳门各个角落。中银集团犹如有机体中一根主动脉，港澳经济少不了她。建国40年来特别是改革、开放10年来，她为港澳经济血液循环畅通无阻而忙，为服务大众、繁荣和稳定港澳经济而忙。
    人无我有　人有我新
    现代化、多元化、国际化三个轮子一起转，服务大众矢志不渝。香港这个国际金融中心，银行林立，百舸争流。现在你随便走进中银集团哪家银行，其门面，其内部设施，工作运转，业务素质，均有明显的改善。这是他们近几年来励精图治的结果。耗费巨资建设、去年开通使用的中银新电脑中心，在目前香港银行业中规模最大，设备也很先进。现代化的电脑联网，你在一家存了款，等于在13家银行、近300家分支机构都有了户头，走到哪都可取可存。业务量不断增长的存款、放款、汇款、保险、信用卡、代客买卖黄金、股票等等，均由电脑提供快捷、准确的服务；遍布街头的700多部“银通”自动提款机网络，除为本集团服务外，还与香港30多家同业连成一体。现代化的设施，为业务多元化、国际化，为服务优质、经济高效创造了条件。
    “人无我有，人有我新”，中银根据不同客户的需要，提供多样化的金融服务。有柜台服务、大堂服务、电话服务、上门服务、邮递服务。自动转期存款，到期银行可给自动转期，客户免办手续，还可免遭利息损失。今年一季度推出的“外汇宝”，一个存折，最多能处理18种外币存款，存户毋需带多本存折。在一些分支行营业厅，常常可以看到顾客们注视电脑终端屏显示的外汇牌价变化，他们会视行情立即决定由何种外币转存何种外币。存户非常欢迎这种“外汇宝”。再如中银集团开办的楼宇分期贷款，期限长达20年，支持市民安居乐业。现在中银对市民购买住宅等楼宇的贷款总额已超过300亿港元。“宝生黄金足九九，港九新界到处有。”中银集团成员之一的宝生银行，是香港代客经营贵金属的权威银行。它不满足于搞单一贵金属业务，立志使自己变成金融超级市场，客户来后犹如进入百货公司或超级市场，可以任意“选购”。
    对外贸易和制造业是香港的经济命脉。因此贸易融资和工业贷款，也是中银集团业务发展的重点。近几年，中银集团的贸易融资业务增长幅度最大。工业贷款则从1983年的3000多笔增至1988年的1.6万多笔。中银还给香港的大型公用事业如海底隧道、地铁、电厂提供了巨额贷款。特别值得一提的是：改革开放10年来，中银支持大批港澳客商走向祖国广阔天地开拓、赚钱。君不见，在珠江三角洲，在沿海开放地带，在长城内外以至天山脚下，到处都有港澳客商的踪迹，投资办厂，加工装配，补偿贸易，搞得红红火火。这是一举三得的大好事啊！对港澳投资者有利，对繁荣港澳经济有利，对内地建设有利。中银集团在近10年中为港澳商人到内地投资及搞“三来一补”提供的融资累计达180多亿港元。
    凡此种种，种种，更不用说中银集团在香港发生银行风潮、股市风潮时参加的“救市”活动，不是最好说明中银集团确确实实是港澳社会中的一员，是真心诚意地为港澳经济的稳定和繁荣而尽心尽力的吗？
    “中银是我们自己的企业”
    中银集团的当地员工多。无论是老一辈的银行家还是年轻的员工都自豪地说：“中银是我们自己的企业。”
    在1.3万多名职工中，中银集团内地派出人员大约只占1％。职工队伍本地化，各姊妹行的高层和中层管理人员，绝大部分均从当地人中选拔，大大增强了中银集团内部的向心力和凝聚力。本地人在这里工作，都感到心情舒畅。最明显的有两条：这儿人际关系平等，“小伙计”和“大经理”职位有区别，但无贵贱之分，人格受到充分尊重；另一条是中国人的归属感，同胞如手足，亲如一家人，在中银工作安全、和谐。这就不难理解为什么在6月挤提风暴中，他们如此爱国爱行，坚守岗位，风雨同舟。因为，他们最明白中银集团是为谁辛苦为谁忙的，中银的一切都凝集着他们的心血、智慧和劳动，他们对客户的解释和劝导也是最具说服力的。
    水乳交融，不仅表现在内部，也表现在社会生活上。近几年，中银集团很重视改善自己的社会形象，积极参与并支持社会公益活动。如中银连续四届独家赞助香港中银杯国际田径“金—哩”邀请赛，独家赞助香港工业总会评选青年企业家活动，参加公益金百万行，国际龙舟赛等等。黄涤岩说得好：
    “作为扎根港澳的银行，要为港澳社会所认同，就必须尽力为当地社会发展作出贡献，同当地社会生活溶成一片。”他们正是这样做的。
    可喜的是，港澳已有越来越多的人认识到：乱了中银集团，也就是乱了港澳金融。中银吸收的存款，取之于港，绝大部分用之于港。近期中银集团存款已有明显回升。不少工商企业和市民已转回存款或要求中银提供各种服务。中银系统1万多名员工正以新的姿态开拓新的局面。
