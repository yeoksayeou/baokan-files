Title: There is a Garbage Dump in the Pacific

In the Pacific Ocean, about a thousand miles northwest of Honolulu, large quantities of plastic products float on the beautiful ocean surface: balls made of soft materials, soap boxes, toys, buttons, and various hard plastic waste. Since plastic products are not afraid of storms and do not sink to the bottom, they are often washed ashore by the waves.

At an international conference on the management of the Pacific Ocean, experts pointed out: "Plastic waste, like oil spills and heavy metals, is a major factor in the destruction of marine life." On several islands in the central Pacific, fifty dead albatrosses were found, of which forty-five died from ingesting small plastic items such as badges, buttons, and similar objects.

Additionally, transparent polyethylene plastic bags thrown from ships look like jellyfish skin, and sea turtles that mistakenly eat them often have their digestive systems blocked, leading to death.

Statistics show that every year, commercial ships alone dump more than sixty thousand plastic containers and packaging boxes into the Pacific Ocean.

　　太平洋有垃圾场
    在火奴鲁鲁西北一千海里的美丽的太平洋洋面上漂浮着大量塑料制品：软材料做的球、肥皂盒、玩具、纽扣，以及一些硬塑垃圾。而塑料制品既不怕风暴又不会沉底，常常被海浪冲到岸边。
    在一次关于治理太平洋的国际讨论会上，专家们指出：“塑料废品就像石油斑和重金属一样是毁灭海洋生物的重要因素。”在太平洋中心地区的几个岛上发现五十个死的信天翁，其中四十五个是死于吞食了一些小的塑料制品，如证章、按纽以及其它类似的物品。
    另外，从船上扔下来的透明的聚乙烯塑料袋，看上去就像海蜇皮，误食它们的海龟消化系统常被堵住，造成死亡。
    据统计，每年仅商船往太平洋倾倒塑料集装箱和包装箱就有六万多个。
