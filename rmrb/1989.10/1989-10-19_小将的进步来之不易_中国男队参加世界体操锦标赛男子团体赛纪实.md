Last night, the lights in the Schleyer Sports Hall in Stuttgart were as bright as day, with nearly all 10,000 seats filled. The first gold medal was about to be decided, and the audience wanted to see both the Soviet team's superb skills and the competition between China and the Democratic German team. In the compulsory exercises, the Chinese team was only 0.350 points behind the Democratic German team. The optional exercises were about to begin, and each team would show their unique strengths.

The Soviet team's practice was clearly superior, and no one doubted that they would win the championship. The Chinese team's goal was to defeat the Japanese team and prepare for next year's Asian Games, while also aiming to defeat the Democratic German team. The Democratic German team had several world-class athletes. As soon as the competition began, the Democratic German team scored high marks with their stable landings. The Chinese team's routines were difficult, showcasing the depth of Chinese gymnastics. Ma Zheng's vault, a "tucked salto with a 360-degree twist," was a new move for this competition. Guo Linxian's parallel bars routine with a double front flip to hang and Li Gang's double back flip to hang were both innovative, but they lacked the stability of the Democratic German team's landings. By the halfway point, the Democratic German team was leading by 0.35 points.

During the fourth event, the horizontal bar, Wang Chongsheng was the second to perform. When he attempted a one-arm giant swing followed by a flip to grab the bar, he slipped slightly and fell, landing on his hands and dislocating his shoulder. His face contorted in pain as he was carried off the field for treatment.

The situation changed abruptly. With one less competitor, could they still compete with the Democratic German team? However, our young athletes had a fierce determination. After Wang Chongsheng was taken off the field, their routines became more stable and elegant. Li Chunyang and Li Jing's tucked front flip with a half twist over the bar and grab were rare in the world, and no one else had attempted them in this competition. Li Chunyang's straight-body flip and double back flip in the floor exercise were unique to this competition, and he landed them very stably. In the final pommel horse event, almost all of the Chinese team's landings were stable. Li Jing scored the highest mark of 9.950 with his Thomas flip and turn. However, with one less competitor, their strength was diminished, and they ultimately finished third, 1.55 points behind.

After the competition, Zhang Jian, the head of the Chinese gymnastics delegation, said that the Chinese team's overall strength was slightly weaker than the Democratic German team. First, their power moves were not enough; second, their stability was lacking; and third, they had some weaker members. However, under the condition of having an injured member, we still achieved our expected goals, and this progress did not come easily. The vice-chairman of the International Gymnastics Federation's Men's Technical Committee, Feng Jibai, said that the Chinese team was different from the Olympic Games last year and was no longer weak. This third place was achieved with new members and under new rules, which was a significant improvement over the Olympic Games level. This also shows that the Chinese team's high-volume training was successful.

    小将的进步来之不易
    ——中国男队参加世界体操锦标赛男子团体赛纪实
    本报记者　江建国
    昨天晚上，斯图加特的施莱尔体育馆内灯光亮如白昼，一万座席几乎满员。第一块金牌即将决出，观众们既想看看苏联队的高超技艺，也想一睹中国与民主德国队之间的较量。在规定动作比赛中，中国队仅仅落后于民主德国队0.350分。自选动作就要开始了，八仙过海，各显其能。
    苏联队一出场练习就显得高人一筹，人们对苏联队稳拿冠军不存怀疑。中国队的目标是打掉日本队，为明年亚运会作准备，同时争取战胜民主德国队。民主德国队中有几个世界名将。比赛一开始，民主德国队就以落地稳连拿了几个高分。中国队动作难度高，显出中国体操的老功底。麻征的跳马“踺子上板后直体360°”是这次大赛的新动作，国林显的双杠前空翻两周挂臂和李舸的双杠后空翻两周挂臂都有独创性，但在落地稳定性方面逊于民主德国队。比赛进行到一半时，民主德国队领先0.35分。
    到了第4项单杠比赛时，王崇升第2个上场。当他作单臂大回环接空翻握杠动作时，不慎离杠稍远，跌落下来，双手触地，造成手臂脱臼。他疼得脸都扭歪了，被抬出场外治疗。
    形势骤变。6个人少了一个，还敢与民主德国队争高低吗？然而，我们的小将自有一股子拚劲。王崇升退场之后，他们的动作更稳了，更漂亮了。李春阳和李敬的屈体前空翻一周半越杠再握杠动作是世界少见的，本届比赛还无别人作过。李春阳在自由体操中的直体旋空翻以及直体后空翻两周结束，也是本次大赛独一无二的，而且落地很稳。最后一项鞍马比赛，中国队几乎个个落地都很稳。李敬以托马斯移位转体等动作，得了9.950的最高分。但终究少了一个人，实力有损，最后以1.55分的差距获第3名。
    中国体操代表团团长张健赛后说，中国队整体实力比民主德国队差一些，第一是力量动作不够，第二是稳定性差，第三还有比较薄弱的人。但是我们在有人受伤情况下，仍然达到预期的目的，进步来之不易。国际体联男子技术委员会副主席冯冀柏说，中国队跟去年奥运会时不一样了，已经不弱了，因为这个第3名是在换了新人、又采用新规则之后取得的，比奥运会水平高了一大截。这也说明中国队的大运动量训练是成功的。
