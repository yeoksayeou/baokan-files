Recently, our county has experienced two consecutive incidents involving the carrying of weapons during commercial activities, leading to fights and obstruction of public duties. These incidents have seriously affected social stability and normal business operations.

On August 22, purchasing agents from a certain unit in Wuzui Township, Nan County, including Ding, came to our county's mountainous area to purchase charcoal. They carried a baton with them. That evening around 7 PM, as the truck carrying the charcoal passed through the Yanglin Township road section, it collided with a farm four-wheeler parked by the roadside. An argument ensued between the two drivers, and the purchasing agent from Nan County struck the four-wheeler driver with the baton, knocking him down.

On September 15, Peng Yuanqing, a driver from the Yongxi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhenyuan County, Guizhou, was transporting tea leaves to the Baishaxi Tea Factory (located in Anhua County). He carried a borrowed "Type 54" pistol. When passing through Huangshaping Town in our county, he refused to cooperate with the commercial and tax authorities' inspection of taxes and fees and threatened them with the gun.

It is understood that similar incidents have occurred in other places as well. We urge all levels of government and relevant departments to strengthen the management of weapons and strictly prohibit the carrying of weapons for commercial activities.

　　禁止携带武器经商
    最近，我县连续发生两起携带武器从事经营活动，引起打架斗殴和妨害公务的事件，严重影响了社会的安定和正常的经营秩序。
    8月22日，南县乌嘴乡某单位采购员丁某等3人来我县山区购买木炭，随身携带警棍一支。当晚7时许，装运木炭的汽车经过我县杨林乡公路段时，撞坏了停靠在公路旁的一台农用四轮车，双方司机发生争执，南县采购员便拿出警棍将小四轮司机击倒。9月15日，贵州镇远县涌溪供销社司机彭元庆到白沙溪茶厂（厂址设安化县）运茶叶，身上携带借来的“五四”手枪一支，途经我县黄沙坪镇时，拒绝工商、税务人员的税费检查，并用枪支相威胁。
    据了解，上述现象在其他地方也时有发生。呼吁各级政府和有关部门切实加强武器的管理，禁止携带武器从事经商活动。
