**Response to the Letter "Applying for Foreign Exchange to Purchase Oil, Secretly Trading Dollars"**

Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on July 1st, Page 6, titled "Applying for Foreign Exchange to Purchase Oil, Secretly Trading Dollars." Our bureau believes that the foreign exchange speculation by the Fangcheng Foreign Ship Supply Company and the provision of bank accounts by the Fangcheng Port Oil Company for this speculation constitute illegal speculative activities. Therefore, we have decided:

1. To confiscate the illegal income of 460,000 yuan from the Fangcheng Foreign Ship Supply Company's foreign exchange speculation and impose a fine of 23,000 yuan.
2. To confiscate the illegal income of 1,127.2 yuan from the Fangcheng Port Oil Company and impose a fine of 2,000 yuan.

The aforementioned fines and confiscated funds will be remitted to the national treasury by the Fangcheng Port Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau. At the same time, we suggest that relevant departments pursue the direct responsibilities of the managers of the Fangcheng Foreign Ship Supply Company and the Fangcheng Port Oil Company.

    倒卖外汇牟取暴利　四十六万元被没收
    你报7月1日第六版刊登了《申请外汇进石油，暗中活动倒美元》的读者来信，我局认为，防城外轮供应公司倒卖外汇和防城港区石油分公司为倒卖外汇提供银行帐户，均已构成投机倒把行为，决定：没收防城外轮供应公司倒卖外汇非法收入46万元，并处以罚款2.3万元；没收防城港区石油分公司非法收入1127.2元，并处以罚款2000元。上述罚没款，由防城港区工商行政管理局上缴国库。同时，建议有关部门追究防城外轮供应公司经理和防城港区石油分公司经理的直接责任。
