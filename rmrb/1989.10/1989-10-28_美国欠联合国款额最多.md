The United States owes the most to the United Nations.

The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Pickering, today handed a check for $65 million to the UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar. This was the first installment of the U.S. contribution to the UN for 1989, but it was less than one-third of what the U.S. should have paid.

According to UN regulations, the U.S. should have paid $216 million to the UN in 1989. Former U.S. President Reagan had promised in his farewell speech to the UN General Assembly that the U.S. would not only pay this amount but also settle all the arrears, totaling $278 million, which accounted for 80% of all the arrears owed by UN member states.

In reality, the U.S. has no intention of fulfilling its past promises. Its aim is to use the arrears to pressure the UN into reforming its institutions and budget-making processes, so that the U.S. and a few other major contributors to the UN can play a bigger role in formulating the overall budget.

　　美国欠联合国款额最多
    新华社联合国10月25日电  美国驻联合国大使皮克林今天向联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔递交了一张6500万美元的支票，作为美国1989年交纳给联合国的第一笔款项，但这一数额还不到美国理应上缴经费的1／3。
    根据联合国规定，美国1989年度应向联合国交纳2.16亿美元。前任美国总统里根曾在联大告别演说中向联合国成员国保证，美国不仅要支付这笔款项，还将交纳以前所拖欠的款项，总额为2.78亿美元，相当于所有联合国成员国所欠款额的80％。
    实际上，美国并不打算履行过去所作的承诺，其目的是要以拖欠的方式压联合国在精减机构和制订预算等方面实行改革，以便使美国等几个向联合国缴款数额最大的国家能在制订全局预算时起更大作用。
