The National Modern Pentathlon Championship concluded today. Veteran athlete Liu Yan from Henan secured her fourth consecutive title in the women's individual event with a national record of 5477 points.

The 1989 National Modern Pentathlon Championship, which featured 48 athletes from 8 teams, spanned five days of intense competition across five disciplines: fencing, swimming, shooting, cross-country running, and equestrian. The championships saw a close contest between athletes from Henan and Guangdong, who shared the four gold medals.

Liu Yan, alongside her teammates, also secured the women's team championship with a total score of 14605 points. Guangdong's Ye Zesheng also claimed two gold medals, winning the men's individual title with 5187 points and contributing to his team's victory in the men's team event with a total score of 15238 points. Guangdong's team outperformed the second-placed PLA team by 348 points.

In the equestrian event, Zhang Limin suffered a setback, dropping from second place after four events to finish out of the medals. This result also meant that the Inner Mongolia team, which had previously won the National Games, left the competition without any medals, marking their first time without a podium finish in a national event.

The runners-up and third-place finishers in each category are as follows: Men's individual, Miao Kai from Hubei and Chen Yuebiao from Guangdong; Men's team, PLA team and Shanghai team; Women's individual, Wang Lianying from PLA and Shao Wenfang from Henan; Women's team, PLA team and Guangdong team.

　　全国现代五项锦标赛落幕
　　刘燕第四次获得女子个人桂冠
    新华社北京10月26日电  （记者梁希仪、梁金雄）河南老将刘燕今天在这里以创全国最好成绩的5477分，再次夺得全国现代五项锦标赛女子个人桂冠。这是她第4次荣膺全国冠军称号。
    有8个队48名男女选手参加的1989年全国现代五项锦标赛5天来，经过击剑、游泳、射击、越野跑和马术5项竞逐，所决出的4项冠军被河南和广东选手分摊。刘燕还和她的队友以14605分的总成绩，为河南队获得女子团体第一名。广东的叶泽生也是两次登上冠军领奖台。他以5187分摘取了男子个人金牌，并和两名队友一起以15238分赢得男子团体冠军。广东队的团体成绩比获第二名的解放军队高出348分。
    女将张丽敏在马术赛时“吃了零”，使她从前4项的积分第二名一落千丈，也使全运会冠军内蒙古队空手而归。这也是该队在全国比赛中唯一没有拿到奖牌的一次。
    获各项第二、三名的是：男子个人，湖北缪凯，广东陈月标；男子团体，解放军队、上海队；女子个人，解放军王恋英，河南邵文芳；女子团体，解放军队，广东队。
