Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation has completed a new seamless steel pipe production line with a capacity of 100,000 tons per year using its own funds. The line has recently started mass production.

The original seamless steel pipe factory of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation was built in the early 1950s. Its production capacity, variety, and quality could not meet the demand. At the beginning of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation decided to raise funds on its own, design and manufacture equipment by itself, and utilize existing factory buildings to carry out production and renovation simultaneously. The entire construction project was carried out under a six-in-one contract system, integrating production, design, construction, equipment manufacturing, material supply, and company departments. This approach achieved the goals of construction and production in the same year, loan repayment in the same year, and an increase in benefits of 19.3 million yuan in the same year. The new equipment produces high-precision, high-quality seamless steel pipes that can replace imported products.

    鞍钢自筹资金建成无缝钢管新生产线
    新华社沈阳十月十一日电（记者陈光明）鞍山钢铁公司自筹资金建成的年产十万吨无缝钢管生产线，近日投入批量生产。
    鞍钢原有的无缝钢管厂是五十年代初期兴建的，产量、品种、质量均不能满足需要。今年年初，鞍钢决定自筹资金，自己设计制造设备，利用现有厂房边生产边改造。整个施工实行了生产、设计、施工、设备制造、材料供应和公司机关处室六位一体承包，从而取得了当年施工、当年投产，当年还贷、当年新增效益一千九百三十万元的成果。新设备产出的无缝钢管精度高，质量好，可替代进口产品。
