Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 16th — (Reporter Zhu Yiquan) The reinterment ceremony for the ashes of renowned patriotic educator Zhang Boling and his wife was held this afternoon in the central garden of Nankai University.

Over nearly half a century, Zhang Boling endured hardships to establish Nankai Middle School, Nankai University, Nankai Girls' School, Nankai Primary School, and Chongqing Nankai Middle School. Zhang Boling's educational practices and principles are rich in content and are a precious legacy in the history of Chinese education.

Zhang Boling and his wife passed away in 1951 and 1961, respectively, and their ashes have been moved several times. Today, the two elders can finally rest in Nankai, fulfilling the wishes of Zhang Boling's relatives and Nankai alumni both at home and abroad, and also realizing Zhang Boling's will: "All my friends and fellow students should strive to unite and work together for the public and the country, support the People's Government, and build a prosperous and happy new China. There is an endless bright future, and I will wait for it with a smile."

The half-body bronze statue of Zhang Boling, which was erected in Nankai University in 1986, was also moved to the central garden of the university today. The ashes of Zhang Boling and his wife were reinterred behind the statue.

Zhang Boling's relatives, as well as some teachers, students, and alumni of Nankai University, totaling over 200 people, attended the reinterment ceremony.

    张伯苓骨灰移葬南开大学
    新华社天津10月16日电　（记者朱玉泉）著名爱国教育家张伯苓及其夫人的骨灰移葬仪式今天下午在南开大学中心花园举行。
    张伯苓先生在将近半个世纪的岁月里，历尽艰辛，先后办起了南开中学、南开大学、南开女中、南开小学和重庆南开中学。张伯苓的教育实践和教育主张有着丰富的内容，是我国教育史上弥足珍贵的遗产。
    张伯苓先生和夫人先后于1951年和1961年逝世，骨灰几易其址。今天，两位老人得以长眠南开，既实现了分布在海内外的张伯苓亲属和南开校友的心愿，也满足了张伯苓先生“凡我友好同学，尤宜竭尽所能，合群团结，为公为国，拥护人民政府，以建设富强康乐之新中国。无限光明远景，余将含笑待之”的遗愿。
    1986年在南开大学落成的张伯苓半身铜像今天也移入校中心花园，张伯苓及夫人的骨灰合葬于铜像后侧。
    张伯苓先生的亲属和南开大学部分师生、校友共200余人出席移葬仪式。
