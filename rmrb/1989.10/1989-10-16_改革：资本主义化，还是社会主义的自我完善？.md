Socialist society advances through construction and reform. This is because the fundamental contradiction between the productive forces, production relations, and superstructure in a socialist society, where they are basically compatible but not completely so, must be resolved through reform. The tremendous achievements of reform since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are well-known worldwide. This proves a truth: Reform is the inevitable path for China to develop its productive forces and build a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist country. The Four Cardinal Principles guide the socialist nature and direction of reform, while reform endows the Four Cardinal Principles with new content for the times. The inherent superiority of the socialist system will be fully realized through reform, greatly enhancing its appeal and strengthening the people's confidence in the socialist system. Through reform, China will stand tall in the East with a new face, making new contributions to world peace and development.

However, we must recognize that in the complex international and domestic environment, reform inevitably involves different approaches. Some people may even propose different reform agendas, attempting to lead China down a dangerous path.

The reform we are implementing, as Deng Xiaoping said, is "the self-improvement of the socialist system" ("Building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics" Revised Edition, p. 121). This has been the consistent guiding ideology of the Party Central Committee regarding reform. In terms of economic reform, the concept of "self-improvement" has two aspects: On one hand, reform refers to improving and perfecting specific systems, forms, operational methods, and procedures within the socialist economic system to make them compatible and establish a vibrant socialist economic system. The core is to enhance the vitality of enterprises, primarily to invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, which are the backbone and foundation of the socialist economy, and to inspire the initiative, creativity, and sense of ownership of the working class. On the other hand, it refers to developing a portion of private and individual economies, as well as cooperation and economic integration among state, collective, and individual economies, and "three types of enterprises," etc. These economic components and forms, as necessary and beneficial supplements to the socialist economy, can make the economic relations of a socialist society more suited to the current stage of productive forces, facilitating social production and the development of various undertakings. The above two aspects constitute the most important content of "socialist self-improvement" in the economic field. Indeed, socialism is a unified social organism in terms of economy, politics, culture, and other aspects. The self-improvement of the fundamental socialist economic system, as well as the reform of the political system and other aspects of the superstructure, should all adapt to the economic base and thus should all be the self-improvement of the socialist system. Under this approach and agenda, after a period of hard work in reform and construction, a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist republic will emerge before us. China's position and role in the cause of world peace and development will be more important and prominent.

However, some people's notion of reform is not the same. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out, some people's so-called "reform" is actually liberalization, that is, capitalist reform. Their central focus for reform is capitalist reform. Without mentioning the reactionary big-character posters, slogans, speeches, and declarations, programs, and constitutions of illegal organizations during the anti-party and counter-revolutionary riots, or the large amount of capitalist reform rhetoric propagated in many newspapers, books, and journals over the past few years, one only needs to flip through the issues of "World Economic Herald" (hereinafter referred to as "WEH") published in the two months before the turmoil to clearly see what bourgeois liberalization's so-called "reform" is. Incidentally, we chose "WEH" as the material for this analysis because it expresses the common demands of those advocating for capitalist liberalization, and more importantly, because of its special relationship with Zhao Ziyang's "think tank," it is more brazen and sharp in expressing bourgeois liberalization than other newspapers.

Economically, they advocate privatization and marketization. Socialist state-owned economy occupies a dominant position in China's national economy. Strengthening and developing the state-owned economy is a decisive condition for ensuring that the collective economy progresses in the socialist direction and for ensuring that individual, private, and other economic components and forms serve socialism. Those advocating for bourgeois liberalization, in order to promote capitalist reform in China, direct their attacks at the socialist state-owned economy, especially at large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises that control the country's economic lifelines. They say: "State ownership has reached its end in the world," while "private and civilian ownership is the only successful path" ("WEH" April 3, 1989, p. 10; February 6, 1989, p. 12). Based on this, they design various schemes for "privatization of state-owned property": some advocate dividing state-owned property into shares and turning it into private property; some advocate state loans for individuals to purchase state-owned enterprises; some advocate infusing private and individual economies with blood to rapidly expand them until they devour state-owned enterprises. Some even propose the strategy of "three years of preparation and then crossing the river," claiming that in three years, by taking measures including buying out officials of socialist countries and "inviting gentlemen from Taiwan to manage the economy together," they will jump from the shore of state-owned planned economy to the opposite shore of private market economy. (See "WEH" February 6, 1989, February 20, 1989, "Why China Should Cross the River to Privatize?" February 27, 1989, "Privatization of State-Owned Property: Trends and Choices in China's Economic Reform") It should be pointed out that China is currently in the primary stage of socialism. Due to the generally low level of productive forces and significant imbalances in development, for a considerable period, various economic components and forms will coexist. To develop the socialist economy and meet the needs of the people, not only is the existence and development of individual economy necessary, but capitalist private economy also has considerable room for development. However, various economic components and forms must be reasonably allocated and developed to prosper urban and rural economies and facilitate people's lives. Individual economy and various forms of private economy must exist as necessary and beneficial supplements to the socialist economy. If individual and private economies are emphasized without restraint in the reform, promoting the policy of privatization to shake, exclude, and replace public ownership, that is genuine capitalist reform, which will bring enormous disasters to the country and the people. On the basis of socialist public ownership, implementing a planned economy combined with market regulation is in line with China's current actual situation and the needs of socialist commodity economy with planning. In contrast, completely denying the planned economy is essentially promoting capitalism.

---

Politically, they advocate pluralism and multi-party system. Those advocating for bourgeois liberalization vehemently deny the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's democratic dictatorship. They claim that "emphasizing the class and ideological essence of democracy is a willful distortion of democracy," and "political pluralism is an inevitable trend of modern politics, and the multi-party cooperation system is a political system that can be implemented in China at the current stage. The key to the multi-party cooperation system is mutual supervision and restraint" ("WEH" April 10, 1989, "Initial Thoughts on China's Reform in the Next Ten Years"). Then, what position does the Communist Party hold in their so-called "multi-party cooperation"? They believe this is "the key to political system reform." They demand that through reform, the activities of the ruling party be restricted to the scope of "(1) party affairs; (2) party fundraising; (3) party discipline; (4) party organization and factions" (from the same source). This not only abolishes the leading position of the Communist Party but also requires the Communist Party to accommodate different political factions and transform the party through "carefully handling different political factions and political views" (from the same source). They slander: China practices "so-called 'dictatorship of the proletariat'" of "one class, one party, one person's power 'deciding everything'" ("WEH" April 24, 1989, p. 5). They demand "thoroughly clearing up and denying the great suffering brought to our society by the suppression of human rights" ("WEH" April 10, 1989, p. 10). It should be pointed out that our state system is the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the Communist Party. This system guarantees the right of the vast majority of the people to be masters of the country. If we talk about human rights, this ensures the broadest human rights. This system practices dictatorship only over a small number of enemies who sabotage socialism, otherwise, it cannot guarantee the democratic rights of the vast majority. We believe that the leadership system of the party and the state needs reform, and our democracy and legal system also need to be further improved and perfected. It is precisely our party that first proposed this task and has made many efforts and achieved considerable results. In China, people's democracy has been greatly expanded rather than narrowed. In the future, we will continue to work hard to reform the political system, develop socialist democracy and legal system. However, China will never adopt a multi-party system and will never abolish the people's democratic dictatorship. Denying the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's democratic dictatorship will lead to chaos in China and a loose federation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, through the people's democratic dictatorship, and walking the socialist path is the conclusion drawn from the development of modern and contemporary Chinese history.

To adapt to the privatization and marketization in the economy, and pluralism and multi-party system in politics, those advocating for bourgeois liberalization claim to "break through the limitations of historical background and institutionalized ideology and renew Marxism" ("WEH" April 10, 1989, p. 10). How to "break through," "renew," and "keep up with the times"? They say: "The erroneous view that employing workers must involve exploitation must be corrected, and the outdated view that socialism must adopt state ownership and planned economy must be abandoned. Socialism is a system beneficial to the people's livelihood. If privatization is beneficial, then privatization is socialism" ("WEH" February 20, 1989, p. 15). They use such names as "breaking through," "renewing," and "keeping up with the times" to, in theory, pass off capitalism as socialism, confusing right and wrong, to create a theoretical basis for turning China's socialist system into a capitalist system through "reform."

---

In the issue of opening up related to reform, they propose to "eliminate outdated political prejudices and ideological interference in China's international affairs," and "especially to greatly enhance" ties with the West ("WEH" April 10, 1989, p. 10). This opening up is to make us abandon socialist principles and assimilate China into the capitalist system of the West. Our opening up is to make the most of foreign funds that can be utilized, actively introduce advanced technology and management experience suitable for China's situation and needs, promote the international exchange of material and culture, absorb everything beneficial from abroad, and enhance the strength of building socialism. However, we will never change China's socialist nature and Marxist ideology. We advocate and implement "using it for ourselves" in opening up, while bourgeois liberalization advocates and implements "Westernizing" in opening up. This is the two opposing approaches and agendas on the issue of opening up.

---

According to the approach and agenda of bourgeois liberalization's reform and opening up, which advocates privatization and marketization in the economy, pluralism and multi-party system in politics, confusing right and wrong in socialist theory, and "Westernizing" in opening up, it will inevitably lead China down the capitalist path of development. This is not only impractical but also disastrous. The Chinese people have endured countless hardships and sacrifices to establish an independent and self-reliant socialist country and open up the path to prosperity, democracy, and civilization. Although China has experienced several major setbacks in its socialist journey, socialism has basically succeeded, and socialism has become the fate of all ethnic groups in China. Capitalist reform and opening up will make the Chinese people, who have become masters of the state, fall back into a state of being enslaved and exploited. The Chinese people will never tolerate this. Then, a stable and developing China will become a chaotic China, a unified China will become a fragmented China, an independent and self-reliant China will become a dependent China of the West, and China's future of prosperity, democracy, and civilization will be ruined.

---

Those advocating for bourgeois liberalization are scheming to turn our reform and opening up into a process of capitalist reform in China, which has both international background and domestic roots. To assimilate socialist countries into the capitalist system is the consistent pursuit of some people in Western countries. After their repeated failures in military conquest, they have been vigorously promoting "peaceful evolution" and "victory without war" to change the social system of socialist countries. In the past twenty years, they have particularly emphasized supporting reform to induce socialist countries to take the capitalist path. China is a socialist power with a global strategic position and enormous development potential, and it is naturally in their target. In the process from political turmoil to the suppression of counter-revolutionary riots, the despicable and clumsy performances of anti-communist and anti-China forces in Western countries fully exposed their true colors. Domestically, although class struggle is no longer the theme of social life, it will exist for a long time within a certain range and may intensify under certain conditions. Due to the inducement and support of Western anti-communist forces, due to the existence of soil for the growth of anti-socialist forces within the country, and due to the socialist system itself still being in the process of perfection and development, the struggle between us and those advocating for bourgeois liberalization, who attempt to turn reform into a process of capitalist reform, is inevitable. The question is whether the behavior of bourgeois liberalization, which attempts to turn reform into a process of capitalist reform, can grow to the extent of threatening the survival of the party and the socialist republic, which depends on the stance and tendency of the party's leadership core, especially the main leaders. The occurrence of this shocking anti-party and anti-socialist incident cannot be blamed on Zhao Ziyang's indulgence and support for bourgeois liberalization and his wrong guidance of reform.

---

The "China Times" of Taiwan reported on May 20: "Zhao's ideological inclination towards liberalization can still be seen from his think tank members, including Yan Jiaqi, Su Xiaokang, Chen Yizi, who are extremely open-minded intellectuals. This group of intellectuals published various articles in the currently popular "World Economic Herald," which has always been regarded as the stronghold of mainland liberal intellectuals and is also the mouthpiece of Zhao's faction. The "World Economic Herald" was particularly favored by the United States for its role in advocating bourgeois liberalization. In the two months before the anti-party and anti-socialist turmoil, this newspaper consecutively published several programmatic articles by Wen Yuanke and others advocating capitalist reform in China. After the political turmoil occurred, it vigorously advocated for "reversing the verdict" against spiritual pollution and liberalization, actively responding to the turmoil. After the Shanghai Municipal Committee made the correct decision to rectify the newspaper, Zhao Ziyang not only did not support it but criticized the Shanghai Municipal Committee for "messing things up" and "becoming passive." This shows how clear his stance of advocating capitalist reform is. When Zhao Ziyang and a few stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization felt that promoting capitalist reform in China was not going smoothly, some members of Zhao Ziyang's think tank proposed a so-called "new authoritarianism." This "ism" completely excludes the working class and the broad masses of the people, who are the main body of reform, and calls for the emergence of a middle class, i.e., a new bourgeoisie, as the social pillar of their so-called "reform." The "World Economic Herald" published an article stating: "China's future middle class can only be formed and developed through the combination of government authority with a modernized orientation and modernized intellectual elites" ("WEH" March 13, 1989, p. 11). Their so-called "modernization" is "Westernization." Zhao Ziyang is the "new authority" in their minds with a Westernized orientation. They thought that relying on him, they could cultivate a new bourgeoisie as the social pillar of China's capitalist reform. However, they were defeated and disintegrated in the face of historical laws. This clearly shows and powerfully proves: Carrying out reform in China according to the approach and agenda of capitalist reform is absolutely impractical. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's guiding ideology of "reform is the self-improvement of the socialist system" is the only correct approach and agenda for us to carry out reform and opening up. By firmly adhering to this approach and agenda, our steps in reform and opening up will definitely be more stable, better, and even faster.

### 改革：资本主义化，还是社会主义的自我完善？

    改革：资本主义化，还是社会主义的自我完善？
    马岩
    社会主义社会是在建设和改革中前进的社会。所以如此，是因为社会主义的生产力、生产关系、上屋建筑之间基本适应又不完全适应的矛盾，必须也只能够通过改革来解决。党的十一届三中全会以来改革的巨大成就，举世瞩目。这个事实证明了这样一个真理：改革是我国发展生产力，建设富强、民主、文明的社会主义国家的必由之路。四项基本原则规范着改革的社会主义性质和方向，改革则赋予四项基本原则以新的时代内容。社会主义制度所固有的优越性通过改革将得以充分发挥，从而大大增强她的吸引力，坚定人民对社会主义制度的自信心。经过改革，中国将以崭新的面貌屹立于东方，为世界的和平和发展作出新贡献。
    但是，我们不能不看到，在一个复杂的国际和国内环境中进行改革，不可避免地存在着不同的思路，有的人甚至会借此提出不同的改革方针，企图把中国引向危险的前途。
    我们实行的改革，诚如邓小平所说：“是社会主义制度的自我完善。”（《建设有中国特色的社会主义》增订本第121页）这是党中央一贯坚持的关于改革的根本指导思想。就经济改革而论，所谓完善，有两个方面的含义：一方面，改革是指在社会主义经济制度内部健全和完善具体的体制、形式和运行手段、程序，使之相互配套，建立起充满生机的社会主义经济体制。其中心环节是要增强企业的活力，主要是要搞活作为社会主义经济骨干和基础的大中型国营企业，焕发工人阶级的积极性、创造性和主人翁精神。另一方面是指在社会主义经济以外，发展一部分私营经济和个体经济以及全民、集体、个体经济相互之间合作经营和经济联合，还有“三资”企业，等等。这些经济成份和经济形式，作为社会主义经济的必要的有益的补充，可以使社会主义社会的经济关系更加适合现阶段生产力状况，以利于社会生产和各项事业的发展。以上两个方面，在经济领域构成“社会主义自我完善”的最重要内容。诚然，社会主义是经济、政治、文化等诸方面统一的社会机体，作为基础的社会主义经济制度的自我完善，作为上层建筑的政治体制和其它方面的改革都应适应经济基础，因而也都应是社会主义制度的自我完善。在这种思路和方针的指引下，经过一个时期的改革和建设的艰苦奋斗，一个富强、民主、文明的社会主义共和国将出现在我们面前。我国在世界和平和发展事业中的地位和作用将更为重要和突出。
    但是，有的人所讲的改革却不是这样。正如邓小平同志最近指出的那样，某些人所谓的“改革”，换个名字叫作自由化，即资本主义化。他们改革的中心是资本主义化。且不说在反党反社会主义的动乱和反革命暴乱中所发表的反动大小字报、标语、演讲和一些非法组织的宣言、纲领、章程等等，也不说几年来许多报刊、书籍所宣扬的大量资本主义化的改革言论，人们只要翻阅一下动乱发生前两个多月内的《世界经济导报》（以下简称《导报》），就完全可以明白无误地看出资产阶级自由化所谓的“改革”是什么了。这里顺便说明一下，我们所以选择《导报》作为透视材料，因为它所表达的是搞资本主义自由化的人们的共同主张，更因为它与赵紫阳同志的“智囊团”有特殊的关系而有恃无恐，比别的报刊表达资产阶级自由化的主张更加鲜明、更加尖锐。
    请看：
    ——经济上主张私有化、市场化。社会主义国有经济在我国整个国民经济中居于主导地位。巩固和发展国有经济是保障集体所有制经济沿着社会主义方向前进，并且保障个体经济、私营经济以及其他经济成份和经济形式为社会主义服务的决定性条件。搞资产阶级自由化的人，为了在中国推行资本主义化，把矛头对准社会主义国有经济，特别是对准决定国家经济命脉的大中型国有企业。他们说：“国有制在世界范围走到了尽头”，而“私有、民营是唯一成功之途”（《导报》1989年4月3日第10版，2月6日第12版）。据此，他们设计出“国有财产私有化”的种种方案：有的主张把国有财产分割成股份而化为私有；有的主张国家贷款给私人购买国有企业；有的主张为私营经济和个体经济输血，促使其急速壮大，直到吞噬国有企业。甚至有人还提出所谓“三年筹备一跳过河”的谋略，胡言用三年工夫，采取包括收买社会主义国家的干部和“请台湾诸公回来共管经济”等措施，从国营计划经济的此岸跳到私人市场经济的彼岸。（以上参见《导报》1989年2月6日、2月20日载《为何中国应一跳过河地进行民营化？》，2月27日载《国有财产个人化：中国经济改革的趋势与选择》）应该指出，我国现在尚处于社会主义初级阶段，由于我国生产力水平总的说来还比较低，发展又很不平衡，在相当长时期内还需要多种经济成份和形式的同时并存。为了发展社会主义经济和满足人民需要，不但个体经济的存在和发展是必要的，而且资本主义性质的私营经济也还有相当的发展余地。但是，多种经济成份和形式只有合理配置和发展，才能繁荣城乡经济、方便人民生活。个体经济和各种形式的私营经济，必须是作为社会主义经济的必要的有益的补充而存在。如果一味不加节制地强调个体经济和私营经济，在改革中推行私有化方针，以私有制来动摇、排斥和取代公有制，那就是地地道道的资本主义化，将给国家和人民带来巨大的灾难。在社会主义公有制基础上，实行计划经济与市场调节相结合，是适合我国现阶段实际状况和社会主义有计划的商品经济的需要的。与此相反，完全否定计划经济，实质上就是搞资本主义。
    ——政治上主张多元化、多党制。搞资产阶级自由化的人，极力否定共产党的领导和人民民主专政。他们声称“强调民主的阶级和意识形态本质，是对民主的肆意曲解”，“政治多元化是现代政治的必然趋势，多党合作制是我国现阶段已能实行的政治制度。多党合作制的关键在于互相监督与制约”（《导报》1989年4月10日载《未来十年中国改革的初步设想》）。那末，共产党在他们所谓的“多党合作”中处于什么地位呢？他们认为，这是“政治体制改革的关键”。他们要求通过改革，把执政党的活动限制在“（1）党理党务；（2）党筹党费；（3）党正党风；（4）党容党派”的范围内。（引自同上）这不仅取消了共产党的领导地位，而且要共产党内容纳不同政治派别，通过“慎重地对待和处理不同政治派别与不同政治观点问题”（引自同上）来改造党。他们诬称：中国实行的是“美其名曰‘无产阶级专政’”的“一阶级、一党派、一人的权力‘决定一切’的专制主义”（《导报》1989年4月24日第5版）。他们要求“彻底清算否定人权、压制人权给我国社会带来的重大苦难”（《导报》1989年4月10日第10版）。应该指出，我们的国家制度是中国共产党领导下的人民民主专政制度。这种制度保证了占人口绝大多数的人民群众当家作主的权利，要说人权的话，这就保障了最为广泛的人权。这种制度只对极少数破坏社会主义的敌对分子实行专政，不这样就不能保障绝大多数人的民主权利。我们认为，党和国家的领导体制是需要改革的，我国的民主和法制也是要进一步健全和完善的。正是我们党首先提出这方面的任务并且已经做了许多努力，取得了相当的成效。在我国，人民民主是空前扩大了而不是缩小了。今后我们还要下大功夫继续改革政治体制，发展社会主义民主和法制。但是，我国决不能搞多党制，决不能取消人民民主专政。否定了共产党的领导和人民民主专政，中国就会天下大乱，一盘散沙。在中国共产党的领导下，经过人民民主专政，走社会主义道路，是中国近现代历史发展得出的结论。
    为了适应经济上私有化、市场化，政治上多元化、多党制的需要，搞资产阶级自由化的人宣称要“突破历史背景与制度化意识形态的局限，刷新马克思主义”（《导报》1989年4月10日第10版）。如何“突破”、“刷新”和“跟上时代”呢？他们说：“雇佣工人必有剥削的错误看法必须改正，社会主义必定要采用国有制与计划经济的过时看法必须抛弃。社会主义就是有利社会民生的制度，若民营化有利，则民营化就是社会主义。”（《导报》1989年2月20日第15版）他们就是这样在“实破”、“刷新”和“跟上时代”等等名目下，在思想理论上把资本主义说成社会主义，鱼目混珠，以此来为通过“改革”将我国的社会主义制度化为资本主义制度制造理论根据。
    在同改革相联系的对外开放问题上，他们提出要“排除不合时宜的政治成见和意识形态对我国国际事务的干扰”，“特别应大大增强”同西方的联系（《导报》1989年4月10日第10版）。这种对外开放，就是要我们放弃社会主义原则，把我国融化到西方资本主义体系中去。我们对外开放，是为了尽可能地多利用一些可以利用的国外资金，积极引进适合我国情况和需要的先进技术和管理经验，促进物质和文化的国际交流，吸取国外一切有益的东西，增添建设社会主义的力量，但决不能改变我国的社会主义性质和马克思主义意识形态。我们主张和实行的“为我所用”的对外开放，资产阶级自由化主张和实行的则是“为西所化”的对外开放。这就是对外开放问题上的两种对立的思路和方针。
    按照资产阶级自由化的这种经济上私有化、市场化，政治上多元化、多党制，社会主义理论上以假乱真，对外开放上“为西所化”的改革开放的思路和方针，势必把中国引向资本主义发展道路。这不但行不通，而且灾难无穷。中国人民经历千辛万苦，流血牺牲，才建立起独立自主的社会主义国家，开通了富强、民主、文明之路。中国在社会主义历程中，虽然遭受过几次重大挫折，但毕竟是社会主义取得基本成功的历史，社会主义已经成为中国各族人民命运之所系。资本主义化的改革开放，要使已经成为国家主人的中国人民重新沦入被奴役、被剥削的境地，中国人民是绝对不会容忍的。那样，稳定发展的中国将变成动乱不止的中国，已经统一的中国将变成四分五裂的中国，独立自主的中国将变成附庸西方的中国，中国的富强、民主、文明的前途将被断送。
    搞资产阶级自由化的人处心积虑地要把我们的改革开放变为中国资本主义化的过程，是有国际背景和国内根源的。把社会主义国家“化入”资本主义体系，是西方国家的某些人的一贯追求。当他们推行武力征服一再遭到失败之后，就极力以“和平演变”、“不战而胜”的谋略来改变社会主义国家的社会制度。近一二十年来，特别着重借支持改革来诱导社会主义国家走上资本主义轨道。中国是一个具有全球战略地位和巨大发展潜力的社会主义大国，当然更在他们的目标之中。在这次从政治动乱到反革命暴乱被平息的过程中，西方国家反共反华势力支持资产阶级自由化的卑劣、笨拙表演，充分暴露了它们的真面目。就国内来说，阶级斗争虽然已经不是社会生活的主题，但在一定范围内将长期存在，在某种条件下还会激化。由于西方反共势力的诱导和支持，由于国内还存在滋生对抗社会主义的势力的土壤，由于社会主义制度自身还处于完善和发展的过程中，我们同企图把改革纳入资本主义化过程的资产阶级自由化之间的斗争将是不可避免的。问题在于资产阶级自由化企图把改革作为资本主义化过程的行为，能否滋长到足以危及党和社会主义共和国的生存的程度，则取决于党的领导核心、特别是主要领导人的立场和倾向。这次骇人听闻的反党反社会主义事件的发生，则不能不归咎于赵紫阳同志对资产阶级自由化的放纵和支持，归咎于他对改革的错误导向。
    台湾《中国时报》5月20日载文说：“赵在思想上倾向自由化，仍可以从他的智囊团成员上看出来，这些成员包括严家其、苏绍智、陈一谘等人，都是思想上极为开放的知识分子。这批知识分子在目前喧腾一时的《世界经济导报》上发表各种文章，该报一直被视为大陆自由派知识分子的大本营，也是赵派人马的传声筒”。《世界经济导报》由于鼓噪资产阶级自由化有功而特别受到美国的青睐。仅在反党反社会主义的动乱发生前两个多月的时间内，该报就接连抛出温元凯等人《未来十年中国改革的初步设想》等多篇宣扬在中国搞资本主义化的纲领性文章。当政治动乱发生之后，它大肆鼓吹为反对精神污染、反对自由化“翻案”，积极与动乱相呼应。当上海市委作出整顿该报的正确决定之后，赵紫阳同志不仅不支持，反而责难上海市委把事情“搞糟了”，“搞被动了”。可见他坚持资本主义化的立场是多么鲜明。当赵紫阳同志和顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的极少数人感到在中国推行资本主义化的方针并不顺利时，赵紫阳同志的“智囊团”中的一些人，抛出了一个所谓“新权威主义”。这个“主义”把改革的主体工人阶级和广大人民群众根本排斥在改革之外，而呼唤中国出现一个中产阶级即新的资产阶级来作为他们所谓的“改革”社会支柱。《世界经济导报》载文称：“中国未来的中产阶级只有依靠现代化导向的政府权威与现代化的知识精英的结合才能形成和发展起来。”（《导报》1989年3月13日第11版）他们所谓的“现代化”就是“西方化”。赵紫阳同志就是他们心目中具有西方化的导向的“新权威”。他们以为依靠他就能够培植起作为中国资本主义化的社会支柱的新的资产阶级。可是，他们在历史规律面前碰得头破血流，土崩瓦解。这清楚地表明和有力地证明：在中国按资本主义化的思路和方针进行改革，是绝对行不通的。邓小平同志提出的“改革是社会主义制度的自我完善”的指导思想，是我们实行改革开放的唯一正确思路和方针。坚决贯彻这种思路和方针，我们改革开放的步子一定会迈得更稳、更好、甚至更快。
