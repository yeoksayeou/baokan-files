The recently concluded Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting adopted a declaration against racism. This declaration, which advocates justice and upholds basic human rights, naturally received the approval and support of the vast majority of the participating countries. However, it was opposed by Britain. The British government's action deepened the divisions among Commonwealth countries over the South Africa issue, further widening the rifts within the Commonwealth, and also dashed the hopes of people around the world who stand for justice.

The extremely barbaric and inhuman racist policies implemented by South Africa are not only a persecution and humiliation of the broad masses of the South African people but also a disgrace to all of humanity. Therefore, the unyielding struggle against South African racists is not only the business of the South African people but also the business of all African peoples. The international community also has a duty to fulfill. For this reason, for many years, many international organizations and international conferences have called for economic sanctions and arms embargoes against South Africa. Most international sports organizations have refused to allow South African athletes to participate in international competitions and have also prohibited athletes under their jurisdiction from going to South Africa. All these measures not only express deep sympathy and support for the South African people who are suffering from racial persecution but also represent a protest and resistance against the South African authorities.

At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the British government stubbornly refused to exert pressure on the white regime in South Africa, effectively encouraging and indulging the South African authorities in continuing to pursue racist policies. The debate at this Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting over the South Africa issue is like a mirror, reflecting the true nature of Britain and certain individuals in Western countries.

Some Western countries, especially the ruling elites of the United States, Britain, and Western European countries, always pose as the champions of "human rights," constantly pointing fingers and criticizing this country for "violating human rights" and scolding that country for "disregarding democratic rights," and readily imposing "sanctions" on other countries, as if they are the only ones in the world who truly uphold "humanity" and "human rights." However, it is precisely these countries that are biased towards South Africa's most barbaric violation of basic human rights under the racist system, refusing to agree to sanctions. This cannot but make one suspect the true intentions of these "human rights guardians."

### “人权卫士”反人权

　　“人权卫士”反人权
    甫告结束的英联邦国家首脑会议通过了一项反对种族主义的宣言。这个伸张正义、维护基本人权的宣言，理所当然地获得绝大多数与会国的赞同和支持。然而，它却遭到英国的反对。英国政府这样做，加深了英联邦国家在南非问题上的分歧，进一步扩大了英联邦内部的裂痕，也使全世界主持正义的人士大失所望。
    南非实施的极端野蛮和不人道的种族主义政策，不仅对广大南非人民是一种迫害和侮辱，对整个人类来说也是一种耻辱。因此，同南非种族主义者进行不懈的斗争，不但是南非人民的事，也是全非洲人民的事，国际社会也责无旁贷。为此，多年来很多国际组织和国际会议呼吁对南非实行经济制裁和武器禁运，多数国际体育组织拒绝南非选手参加国际比赛，也不允许本组织管辖下的运动员前往南非。所有这些措施，不仅是对深受种族主义迫害的南非人民的深切同情和支持，也是对南非当局的抵制和抗议。
    英国政府在英联邦首脑会议上，顽固地拒绝向南非白人政权施加压力，实际上是对继续推行种族主义政策的南非当局的怂恿和姑息。这次英联邦首脑会议就南非问题展开的争论如同一面镜子，照出了英国及西方国家某些人的本来面目。
    一些西方国家，特别是美国、英国和西欧国家的当权人士，总是以“人权”的卫道士自居，不断地指手划脚，指责这个国家“违反人权”，呵斥那个国家“蔑视人的民主权利”，动不动就要对别国实行什么“制裁”，好像世界上唯有他们最讲“人道”，讲“人权”。但是恰恰是它们对南非最野蛮地摧残基本人权的种族主义制度加以偏袒，硬是不同意制裁。这不能不使人怀疑这些“人权卫士”究竟出于何种目的。　·月霖·
