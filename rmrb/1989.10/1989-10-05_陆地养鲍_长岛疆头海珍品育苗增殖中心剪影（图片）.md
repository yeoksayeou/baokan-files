Abalone, traditionally a marine species, is now being successfully farmed on land at the Long Island Jiangtou Seafood Seedling Breeding Center in Shandong Province.

This center is currently the largest and most advanced factory-based abalone farming base in the country. Construction began in 1986 with an investment of over 10 million yuan and a building area of more than 10,000 square meters.

Abalone is highly nutritious and is known as the "king of seafood." However, it has unique living habits, grows slowly, and natural resources are scarce. In recent years, the center has adopted scientific farming methods, using natural abalone seeds for artificial breeding and hatching, simulating the living conditions of abalone in the sea, and mastering the living habits of abalone. By the end of 1987, the center successfully farmed abalone. Currently, the center has bred 14 million abalone, and by the end of this year, 200,000 marketable abalone will be available for the market.

    陆地养鲍
    ——长岛疆头海珍品育苗增殖中心剪影
    鲍鱼本是海里生长，如今山东省长岛疆头海珍品育苗增殖中心却在陆地建厂养鲍鱼，获得成功。
    该中心是目前全国规模最大，设备最先进的工厂化养鲍鱼基地，1986年开始兴建，投资1000多万元，建筑面积一万多平方米。
    鲍鱼营养丰富，素有海味之冠的美称。但生活习惯特殊，生长缓慢，自然资源少。近年来，该中心采取科学养殖方法，取天然种鲍经人工培育孵化，仿海中鲍鱼的生活条件，掌握了鲍鱼的生活习性，于1987年底试养成功。目前，该中心已养殖1400万只鲍鱼，到今年底可有20万只商品鲍鱼投入市场。
