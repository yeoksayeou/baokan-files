Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 21st.

The Taiwan Times recently published an editorial stating, "How long will Taiwan's surface prosperity last? Everyone is worried."

The editorial, titled "When Will Taiwan's Chaos End?", points out that currently, Taiwan is in chaos everywhere: the stock market is chaotic, social order is chaotic, the political arena is chaotic, the business world is chaotic, academic and intellectual thought is chaotic, economic development direction is chaotic, legal systems are chaotic, politics are chaotic, truths (right and wrong) are chaotic, and morals are chaotic, among many other issues.

The article states that the prevalence of utilitarianism is the root cause of Taiwan's chaotic situation. In this chaotic environment, societal values are inverted, "providing a perfect opportunity for the bad guys to rise to the top." Taiwan's party politics are also in disarray. For example, individuals participating in elections from the Kuomintang (KMT) only consider their own interests. If they do not get nominated, they immediately oppose the KMT. These people are merely using the KMT for their own gain.

The editorial mentions that Taiwan's environmental pollution is severe, with the ecological environment being seriously damaged. More seriously, the moral decay and the decline of ethical norms in Taiwanese society make the quality of life for Taiwanese people worse day by day.

### 《台湾时报》社论质问  台湾乱局何时休

　　《台湾时报》社论质问
　　台湾乱局何时休
    据新华社北京10月21日电　《台湾时报》日前发表社论说，“台湾表面上的繁荣到底还会维持多久，大家都忧心忡忡”。
    这篇题为《台湾的乱局何时休？》的社论指出，当前的台湾，到处都是乱，股市的乱、社会秩序的乱、官场上的乱、商场上的乱、学术思想的乱、经济发展方向的乱、法制的乱、政治的乱、真理（事非正邪）的乱、道德的乱等等，太多了。
    文章说，功利主义的盛行是台湾社会出现乱局的根源，在这种乱的局面下，社会应有的价值观念本末倒置，“正好是坏人出头的好机会。”台湾的政党政治也是一片混乱，譬如说，国民党参加竞选的人员，只以自己的利益为基础，一旦没有获得提名就立即反对国民党，这些人只是利用国民党投机而已。
    社论中说，台湾的环境污染已是十分厉害，生态环境受到严重地破坏，更为严重的是，台湾社会道德的败坏和伦理规范的沦落，更使台湾民众的生活素质一天不如一天。
