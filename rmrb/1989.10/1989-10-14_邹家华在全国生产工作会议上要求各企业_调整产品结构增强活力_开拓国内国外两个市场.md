At the National Production Work Conference, which concluded on October 11, State Councilor Zhou Jiahua addressed several issues in China's current economic activities. He urged local governments and enterprises to focus on both domestic and international markets, adjust their product structures, and adopt proactive measures to adapt to the ever-changing market demands, thereby enhancing enterprise vitality.

Zhou Jiahua emphasized that local governments should explore more ways to enter the international market. The success of our products in foreign markets hinges on factors such as quality, variety, delivery time, and after-sales service. It is crucial to recognize that after-sales service is a vital component of an enterprise's economic activities. Currently, China has substantial processing capabilities, which can be leveraged through methods like processing with supplied materials and samples to tap into potential markets.

Zhou Jiahua noted that our import volumes are significant, with many items being products that can be manufactured domestically, such as color televisions and refrigerators. Despite substantial domestic production, whole television sets were still imported last year. Therefore, in the future, any products that can be manufactured domestically should be sourced domestically as much as possible. The situation where domestic production capacity is idle while large quantities are imported must be rectified.

Discussing the domestic market, Zhou Jiahua pointed out that for consumer goods, attention should not be limited to urban markets but should also include rural markets. Efforts should be made to strengthen sales promotion. Market development is a crucial area of study, and production without sales does not complete the economic activity cycle.

Zhou Jiahua also called for adjusting product structures in conjunction with the "Double Increase and Double Reduction" campaign to provide society with high-quality, low-consumption, and affordable products.

In conclusion, Zhou Jiahua stated that the current market situation, where some products are experiencing sluggish sales, presents an opportunity for enterprises to improve their overall quality. Local governments should seize this moment to enhance their enterprises' technical, management, product quality, variety, and energy-saving capabilities, elevating the overall quality of enterprises to a new level.

    邹家华在全国生产工作会议上要求各企业
    调整产品结构增强活力
    开拓国内国外两个市场
    新华社北京10月13日电（记者赵明亮）在10月11日闭幕的全国生产工作会议上，国务委员邹家华针对目前我国经济活动中存在的一些问题，要求各地各企业要面向国内国外两个市场，调整产品结构，开拓两个市场，并采取积极措施，适应市场不断变化的需要，增强企业活力。
    邹家华指出，各地应更多地想办法打进国际市场。我们的产品在国外能不能有出路，关键是看产品质量，花色品种、交货时间、售后服务等能否满足国外市场的要求。应当认识到，售后服务是企业经济活动中的重要一环。目前我国加工能力很大，要用来料加工、来样加工等方式发挥潜力。
    邹家华说，现在我们的进口量很大，其中有很多是国内能制造的产品。如彩电、电冰箱等，国内产量已很大，但去年还在进口电视整机。因此，今后凡是国内能制造的要尽可能从国内解决。国内生产能力闲置，而又大量进口的情况必须设法扭转。
    邹家华在谈到国内市场时指出，对于生活资料，不应只看到城市市场，还要看到农村市场，要加强推销工作。开拓市场是一门重要的学问，要很好研究。只生产，没销售，就没有完成经济活动的全过程。
    邹家华还要求结合“双增双节”运动的开展，调整产品结构，给社会提供质优、低耗、价廉的产品。
    邹家华最后说，目前市场上部分产品出现滞销情况，给企业提供了一个提高本身素质的好机会。各地要抓住时机，从技术、管理、产品质量、花色品种及节能降耗等方面，把企业整体素质提高到一个新水平。
