Jiang Zemin, Li Peng and other comrades meet with representatives of returning scholars
Warmly praise students' determination to return to the country and serve the nation
Point out that to boost the economy, a stable and united environment is essential
Rely on science and technology, education, and the strength of intellectuals

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th - The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, Politburo member Li Tieming, and State Councilor Song Jian today met with representatives of scholars who have recently returned from studying abroad and have made achievements in various fields. After taking a group photo, Jiang Zemin, Li Tieming, and Song Jian had a discussion with them.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, more than 70,000 students have been sent to 76 countries and regions to study and further their education. Among them, 42,000 have returned to the country to engage in construction, with 32,000 of them returning during the ten years of reform and opening up. Currently, they are serving as the backbone or core in teaching, science, and various other fields.

The 31 middle-aged and young scholars present today have diligently pursued their studies abroad, achieving results that have attracted attention. However, many of them have given up high-paying job offers and comfortable living conditions to return to their motherland. This precious spirit was praised by Comrade Jiang Zemin.

The representatives of the returning scholars attributed their growth to the Party's education and cultivation. They expressed their willingness to use their knowledge to benefit the people. Jiang Zemin said: To boost the economy, we must first have a stable and united environment. We must rely on science and technology, education, and the strength of intellectuals. From you, I see the future and hope of China.

Jiang Zemin also mentioned that in the past period, due to the influence of some foreign media, some overseas students who were not fully informed about the situation at home developed misunderstandings, leading to some extreme behaviors. This is understandable. He said, "No one is a saint, who can be without fault? If one corrects their mistakes, they should be welcomed."

Regarding the policy of sending students abroad, Li Tieming believes it is a successful policy in the process of reform and opening up, and it can only be improved in the future. For both self-funded and government-sponsored students returning from abroad, they should be employed based on their abilities and treated equally.

Song Jian also spoke at the meeting.

The Minister of Personnel, Zhao Dong'an, chaired the three-hour-long meeting.

    江泽民李鹏等同志会见留学回国人员代表
    热情赞扬学子归来报国有志
    指出把经济搞上去首先要有安定团结环境  要依靠科学技术与教育依靠知识分子力量
    新华社北京10月6日电　中共中央总书记江泽民、国务院总理李鹏、政治局委员李铁映、国务委员宋健今天下午在中南海怀仁堂亲切接见近年来从海外学成归来、在国内有所建树的留学回国人员的代表。合影之后，江泽民、李铁映、宋健和他们进行了座谈。
    建国以后，中国有7万余留学人员被派往76个国家和地区学习、进修，4.2万人已先后回国投身于建设事业，其中3.2万余人是十年改革开放中学成回国，目前在教学、科教和各个领域里作为中坚或骨干施展着自己的才智。
    今天在座的31名中青年留学回国人员，在海外勤于学业，获得的成就引起行家的重视，但是他们之中的许多人放弃了重金聘请和优裕的生活条件，毅然回到祖国。这种可贵的精神受到了江泽民同志的赞扬。
    留学回国人员的代表把自己的成长归功于党的教育和培养，他们表示要把自己学到的知识造福于人民。江泽民说：把经济搞上去，首先要有安定团结的环境，要依靠科技与教育，依靠知识分子的力量。从你们身上我看到了中国的前途和希望。
    江泽民还提到，前一段由于某些外国舆论的影响，一些不明真相的留学生对国内的情况产生误解，导致了一些偏激的行为，这是可以理解的。他说，人非圣贤，孰能无过。知错就改，就应当受到欢迎。
    对派遣留学人员这一措施，李铁映认为是开放改革中一项成功的政策，今后只能做得更好。对于自费或公派的留学人员，回国后要按才录用，一视同仁。
    宋健也在座谈会上讲了话。
    人事部长赵东宛主持了长达三小时的座谈会。
