In Bucharest, we heard a joke about the people of Olt: two people from Olt never sleep head to head because they are both "sharp-headed," full of tricks. If they slept head to head, neither would be able to sleep.

The people of Olt refer to those living in the Olt region of southern Romania. Are they really like the joke describes?

The capital of Dolj County is Craiova City, which is the first major city in the Olt region. Locals say it is the "capital" of Olt.

In Craiova City, we first visited a doctor. After a friendly chat, we prepared to leave, but the doctor and his wife insisted on having us stay at their home. We tried to decline, but they wouldn't have it. They also took care of all our meals, serving us delicious food every day.

Engineer Ivorovsky from the Craiova City Furniture Factory is someone we met by chance in Beijing earlier this year. When he heard we were visiting, he was overjoyed and invited us to his home. This engineer speaks frankly, is sincere, and treats people warmly, making him very approachable.

Several Chinese comrades were in Craiova City's "Electric Power" factory to inspect diesel locomotives exported from Romania to China. They lived in an apartment building in the city. During festivals, someone would leave cakes and fruits at the door of the Chinese comrades, ring the bell, and leave. The Chinese comrades would open the door to find the gifts but no one. When they asked the neighbors, no one would admit to it. On December 29, 1988, they even received a box of oranges and chocolates, which were rarely seen in the market, along with a New Year's card drawn by a child. The Chinese comrades tried several times to "catch" this unexpected visitor, but they were unsuccessful. When the Chinese comrades were about to leave for home, someone came to deliver things again. This time, they finally "caught" the stranger—a young girl from Olt.

These incidents fully demonstrate the kindness and hospitality of the people of Olt.

The changes in Craiova City's appearance fully show that the people of Olt are smart and hardworking. In the past, the city had narrow streets, dilapidated houses, and very few tall buildings. Now, the city has completely changed, becoming a beautiful new city with stylish, colorful buildings and widened streets. The author has visited many cities in Romania and feels that the changes in Craiova City are the most striking.

Heading south from Craiova, not far from the northern bank of the Danube, is the famous sand region. Before the 1960s, this area was Romania's "desert," with endless sand and no crops. However, the people of Olt spent 20 years transforming this vast sandy area into fertile fields.

Before leaving Craiova City, we met with five Romanian scholars who study humanities and folklore. The topic also turned to jokes that ridicule the people of Olt. The director of a local publishing house said, "We people of Olt are all optimists. When we get together, we are always happy. You won't find anyone here with a frown. Some people have nothing to do but make jokes. Jokes that mock and tease us people of Olt are actually made by ourselves. Sharing these jokes with outsiders and adding some fun to their lives, what's wrong with that?" At this point, everyone nodded in agreement with his statement.

Craiova City writer Felan said, "We people of Olt cherish friendship and are enthusiastic in entertaining friends. For enemies, we hate them to the core. A well-known local folk song says:

    'Here, wildflowers bloom everywhere,
    I was born in Olt.
    Whoever is good to me,
    I will take off my fur coat and give it to them.
    Whoever is bad to me,
    God should let them run away quickly,
    Otherwise, I will be like a poisonous snake,
    Making them die quickly and painlessly!'

    He continued, "For Chinese friends, I should immediately take off my fur coat and give it to you. Unfortunately, it's not winter now, I'm not wearing a fur coat, and you don't need to wear one. Alright! I'll copy this poem and give it to you." As soon as he finished speaking, everyone burst into laughter.

The editor-in-chief of the local party newspaper said to us, "See, the people of Olt are cunning! He actually gave a small piece of paper as a fur coat. Outsiders won't curse us?"

    奥尔特尼亚人
    张汉文  周荣子
    在布加勒斯特，我们听到一个关于奥尔特尼亚人的笑话：两个奥尔特尼亚人从不顶头而睡，因为他们都是“尖头”，脑子里净是鬼点子，如果头顶头，那谁也睡不着。
    奥尔特尼亚人是指罗马尼亚南部奥尔特尼亚地区的人。他们真如“笑话”中所说的那样吗？
    多尔日县的首府是克拉约瓦市，它是奥尔特尼亚地区的第一重镇，当地人说它是奥尔特尼亚的“首都”。
    在克拉约瓦市我们先去看望一位医生，促膝交谈后我们告辞，但医生夫妇说什么也不干，非让我们住在他们家，怎么拒辞也不行，而且一日三餐也由他们包了，顿顿都是好饭菜。
    克拉约瓦市家具厂的工程师伊沃特斯库是我们今年年初在北京偶然认识的。他听说我们去访问后喜出望外，主动邀请我们到他家作客。这位工程师说话坦率，态度真诚，待人热忱，很容易接近。
    有几位中国同志是在克拉约瓦市“电力”工厂验收罗马尼亚向中国出口的柴油内燃机车的。他们住在市内一公寓楼内。逢年过节总有人把蛋糕、水果放在中国同志的门前，按一下铃便走了。中国同志开门后只见送来的礼品，不见人。他们问周围的住户，谁也不承认。1988年12月29日他们甚至还收到了一盒连市场上都很少见到的桔子、巧克力，里面还有一个小孩子画的贺年片。中国同志几次想“捉拿”这位不速之客，但都不成功。等中国同志要动身回国了，又有人来送东西。这次，他们终于“抓住”了这位陌生人——一个上小学的奥尔特尼亚小姑娘。
    这些事都充分显示了奥尔特尼亚人宽厚、好客。
    克拉约瓦市容的变化充分说明，奥尔特尼亚人是聪明、勤快的。过去这座城市街道狭窄，房舍破旧，大楼极少。现在市容彻底变了样，成了一座漂漂亮亮的新城，到处是式样新颖、颜色协调的楼房和建筑物，街道也加宽了。笔者到过罗马尼亚许多城市，觉得克拉约瓦市的变化最突出。
    从克拉约瓦向南行，离多瑙河北岸不远便是闻名全国的沙地地区。60年代以前，这里是罗马尼亚的“沙漠”，黄沙漫漫，不长庄稼。可是，奥尔特尼亚人用了20年时间，把这片大面积的沙地改造为良田。
    告别克拉约瓦市之前，我们同五位研究人文、民俗的罗马尼亚学者见了面，话题也扯到了有关讽刺奥尔特尼亚人的笑话上。当地一家出版社社长说：“我们奥尔特尼亚人都是乐天派，大家聚在一起总是乐呵呵的。在这里你找不到愁眉苦脸的人。有的人没事干就编笑话。挖苦、捉弄我们奥尔特尼亚人的笑话，就是我们自己编出来的。把这些笑料也讲给外地人听，给他们的生活增加乐趣，这有什么不好？”这时大家都点头表示赞同他的说法。
    克拉约瓦市作家费兰说：“我们奥尔特尼亚人很珍视友情，对朋友热情款待，对敌人则恨之入骨。一首人人皆知的地方民谣这样说：
    “此处遍地开野花，
    我天生在奥尔特尼亚。
    谁要是对我好，
    我会脱下皮袄送给他。
    谁要是对我坏，
    上帝应让他快点跑开，
    否则我会像毒蛇，
    使他死得快又快！”
    他又接着说：“对于中国朋友，我应当立即脱下皮袄送给你们。可惜现在不是冬天，我没穿皮袄，而你们也不需要穿皮袄。好吧！我就把这首诗抄下来送给你们。”他的话音刚落，大家哄堂大笑。
    当地党报主编对我们说，“你看，还是奥尔特尼亚人滑头吧！他竟把一张小纸片当成皮袄送人。外地人能不骂我们吗？”
