Guangdong Province Governor Ye Xuanping hosted a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee, Khay San Phomvihane, and his entourage on their visit to Guangdong.

In his speech at the banquet, Khay San recalled the days when he was in Guangzhou discussing strategies to oppose imperialism and strive for world peace with Premier Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Yi. He said, "Guangzhou is a city with great historical significance. Today, my visit to Guangzhou is a return to familiar grounds, and I am deeply moved."

Khay San said: "Opening up and reform are unprecedented undertakings, and they are novel endeavors. In the process of progress, it is inevitable that some problems and shortcomings will arise. In Beijing, I learned that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is fully aware of the existing problems and has taken measures to improve them. I am confident that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the opening up and reform of China will achieve even greater victories."

Chairman Khay San arrived in Guangzhou this afternoon, accompanied by the head of the Chinese government delegation, Minister of Labor Yuan Chongwu, on a special plane from Shanghai.

When Khay San and his entourage left Shanghai, the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Shanghai, Zhu Rongji, saw them off at the airport.

In the morning, Khay San and his entourage visited the Shanghai Municipal Party School of the Communist Party of China and exchanged views with the school leadership on how to train and cultivate Party cadres. Subsequently, the Lao guests also visited the Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone.
