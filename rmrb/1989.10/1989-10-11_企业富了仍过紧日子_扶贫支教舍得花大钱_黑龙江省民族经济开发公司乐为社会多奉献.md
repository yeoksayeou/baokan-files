The Black Dragon River Province Ethnic Economic Development Company, which has not spent a single cent of state funds, has been operating for several years, consistently prioritizing social benefits alongside economic benefits. Through various means, it has been engaged in poverty alleviation and educational support, earning the title of a "dedicated" enterprise.

This company was established in July 1985 by ethnic Korean, Hui, Mongol, Manchu, and Xibe employees using private funds. In 1988, its business volume reached 120 million yuan, with a tax revenue of 22 million yuan. In the first half of 1989, its business volume was 1.5 billion yuan, with a tax revenue of 180 million yuan. The per capita tax revenue has been over 200,000 yuan for two consecutive years, ranking first in the province's commercial system.

With the company prospering, how should the funds be allocated? Their priority is: first the country, second the enterprise, and third the individuals. 85% of the profits are used for expanded reproduction, 10% for poverty alleviation in ethnic minority areas, 3% for supporting ethnic minority education, and 2% for the salaries and welfare of the company's employees.

In recent years, they have allocated over 500 million yuan for poverty alleviation and educational support.

In assisting ethnic minorities to become prosperous, the company has allocated 15 million yuan to establish the Black Dragon River Province Ethnic Minority Development Fund and decided to allocate 10% of the post-tax profits annually to expand this fund. In June 1986, they initiated a poverty alleviation pilot project in the poorest village of Lianzhu Mountain in Mishan City, investing 20 million yuan to establish a graphite mine, providing jobs for 200 local laborers, and increasing the villagers' annual income by 20 to 40 million yuan. They also allocated 10 million yuan to establish a poverty alleviation fund in Lianzhu Mountain Village and decided to allocate 20% of the post-tax profits from the graphite mine annually to expand this fund.

The company frequently allocates funds to help individuals and schools with financial difficulties. They allocated 1.5 million yuan to repair school buildings in Dongming Village, Liuhe Township, Yanshou County, 5 million yuan to install heating in Mishan City Vocational High School, and 30 million yuan to assist the Korean Middle School in Yanshou County in establishing a business. Over the years, they have invested a total of 80 million yuan in this area. In July 1988, they allocated 50 million yuan to independently establish the Black Dragon River Province Ethnic Minority Education Foundation. This year, on Teachers' Day, they allocated 6 million yuan to hold the first Black Dragon River Province Ethnic Minority Teachers' Award and Commendation Conference in a public-private partnership with the Provincial Education Commission.

This company, which has created good economic and social benefits, insists on thrift and hard work. For three years, they operated in a 24-square-meter shack without a proper office. They have not built housing for employees' families or purchased a company bus, and employees commute using public transportation. Employee salaries have been maintained at the middle-level enterprise standard, with the lowest salary at 50 yuan and the highest at 190 yuan. Bonuses are strictly distributed according to state regulations. The company's general manager, Cui Xiuzhen, often does ideological work for the employees: "The country's foundation is weak, and the company is in its startup phase. We cannot enjoy the fruits of our labor yet. Everyone needs to tighten their belts and endure for a few more years."

    企业富了仍过紧日子　扶贫支教舍得花大钱
    黑龙江省民族经济开发公司乐为社会多奉献
    本报讯　没花国家一分钱的黑龙江省民族经济开发总公司创办几年来，坚持社会效益与经济效益并重，采取多种方式扶贫支教，被赞誉为“奉献型”企业。
    这家企业是1985年7月由朝鲜、回、蒙、满、锡伯等少数民族职工靠民间力量创办的。1988年，经营额为1.2亿元，利税2200万元；1989年上半年经营额为1.5亿元，税利1800万元，人均创税利连续两年达20多万元，在全省商业系统居首位。
    企业富了，如何支配资金？他们排的位置是一国家、二企业、三个人。利润的85％用于扩大再生产，10％用于少数民族地区扶贫，3％用于支援少数民族教育，2％用于本企业职工工资和福利待遇。
    这几年，他们为扶贫和支援教育共拿出500多万元。
    在帮助少数民族脱贫致富上，这家公司用150万元设立黑龙江省少数民族发展基金，并决定每年从税后利中拿出10％扩大这个基金。1986年6月，他们在密山市最贫困的连珠山乡搞扶贫试点，投入200万元创办石墨矿，安排当地劳动力200名，每年可使村民增加20至40万元收入；拿出10万元在连珠山乡设立扶贫基金，每年还从石墨矿税后利中拿出20％扩大这个基金。
    公司经常出资帮助个人和学校解决经费上的困难，拿1.5万元为延寿县柳河乡东明村维修校舍，拿5万元为密山市职高学校安暖气，30万元资助延寿县朝鲜族中学校办企业，几年来这方面投资共80万元。1988年7月，他们拿出50万元独家成立黑龙江省少数民族教育基金会。今年教师节，又出资6万元，采取民助官办形式，和省教委一起召开黑龙江省首届少数民族教师奖励表彰大会。
    这家创造了良好经济与社会效益的公司，坚持勤俭节约，艰苦奋斗，在24平方米的一个偏厦里办公3年，至今没有像样的办公地点。他们没盖职工家属房，没买通勤客车，职工上下班全挤公共汽车。职工工薪一直保持在中等企业水平，现在最低薪为50元，最高薪为190元，奖金严格按国家规定发放。公司总经理崔秀镇经常这样做职工的思想工作：“国家底子薄，公司处于创业阶段，我们现在还不能享受。大家还要勒紧腰带忍几年，再忍几年。”　（毕国顺　武培真）
