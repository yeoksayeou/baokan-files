    Improving Enterprise Management and Service Quality
    Changchun Department Store Signs Contract with Customer Satisfaction as a Key Indicator

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Correspondent Li Anda reports: On October 10th, Changchun Department Store signed a novel contract with the Changchun Municipal Commerce Bureau and the Finance Bureau—a customer satisfaction contract. This means that state-owned commercial enterprises, in addition to having economic performance indicators, also have social benefit indicators in their contracts; the performance of the enterprise is not only evaluated by relevant higher authorities but also directly by customers. According to relevant officials, this type of contract is the first of its kind nationwide.

    Changchun Department Store is a large department store with over 2,000 employees and more than 10,000 square meters of retail space. For many years, they have been renowned nationwide for their excellent management and high service quality, and recently, they were rated as a second-level national enterprise.

    The specifics of the customer satisfaction contract include: ensuring that the variety, styles, and quality of products meet customer satisfaction, providing courteous service and attentive care to meet customer satisfaction, implementing price and measurement policies to meet customer satisfaction, and maintaining store appearance, environment, and hygiene to meet customer satisfaction. The evaluation method involves the contracting party periodically distributing evaluation forms to the public or handing out evaluation tickets to customers at the service site, allowing the public and customers to participate directly in the evaluation. The scoring is divided into five levels: “very satisfied” is 100 points, “satisfied” is 90 points, “basically satisfied” is 60 points, “not satisfied” is 30 points, and “very dissatisfied” is 0 points. The average total score is the store's performance indicator. The contract stipulates that the customer satisfaction base score for the store in 1989 is 80 points. For every point the indicator improves, the supervising department rewards the store with 1% of the total retained profit; for every point it decreases, 1% of the total retained profit is deducted (rewards or deductions do not exceed 5% in total).

    Zhang Youzhi, the general manager of Changchun Department Store, told the reporter: “Signing this contract gives us a hard indicator in spiritual civilization construction and social benefits. Although the pressure is greater, it also drives us to study and improve enterprise management, raising our sales and service to a new level.”

    改善企业管理　改进服务质量
    长春百货大楼签承包合同  顾客满意程度作硬性指标
    本报讯　记者李安达报道：10月10日，长春百货大楼与长春市一商局、财政局签订一份新颖的承包合同——顾客满意度承包合同。这样，国营商业企业在承包中不仅有了经济效益的硬指标，也有了社会效益的硬指标；企业工作的好坏不仅由上级有关部门来评价，广大顾客也直接参与评价。据有关方面人士称，在全国，这种合同属第一份。
    长春百货大楼是一个有2000多名职工、1万多平方米营业面积的大型百货商店。多年来，他们以经营管理好、服务质量高闻名于全国同行业，最近又被评为国家二级企业。
    这次签订的顾客满意度承包合同，具体内容包括：经营品种、花色、质量让顾客满意，礼貌待客、周到服务让顾客满意，执行物价计量政策让顾客满意，店容店貌、环境卫生让顾客满意。考核办法是由发包方定期向社会发放评议信或在商店服务现场向顾客发评议票，让社会和顾客直接参加评议，分5个档次记分：“很满意”为100分，“满意”为90分，“基本满意”为60分，“不满意”为30分，“很不满意”为0分，总平均分数为商店完成的指标。合同规定1989年商店顾客满意度基数为80分。完成指标每提高1分，由主管部门奖励该商店留利总额的1％；每减少1分，扣罚商店留利总额的1％（奖励或扣发最高均不超过5％）。
    长春百货大楼总经理张有智对记者说：“签订这个合同，使我们在精神文明建设、社会效益方面也有了硬指标。压力虽然大了，但这也促使我们去研究和改善企业管理，在销售和服务方面上一个新台阶。”
