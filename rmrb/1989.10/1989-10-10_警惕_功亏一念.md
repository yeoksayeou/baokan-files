	Beware of "Failure at the Last Moment"
	Yan Changqi

	In recent times, newspapers have frequently reported "explosive news": such as the national labor model, Tianjin Bicycle Factory Director Li Qizu being sentenced to prison; the man known as "gold cannot buy a loyal heart" in Suzhou, Jian Qinbiao, falling into the abyss; the famous person from Liaoyang, Xiong Jiaqing, being arrested by law... and so on. The fall of these "stars" and "models" has caused a stir among the people. Their actions have greatly exceeded people's expectations.

	According to those engaged in political and legal work, when analyzing the mentality of economic criminals, they found that many people often make a mistake "in a moment of weakness." This "moment of weakness" is worth pondering.

	Objectively speaking, among these people who once wore laurel wreaths but later fell into the abyss, although there are indeed those who cheated to gain honors through trickery, not everyone was a bad person with evil intentions from the start. For example, the director of Liaoyang Textile Factory, Xiong Jiaqing, was once praised by people as a "bold reformer who treats the factory with the momentum of withering and pulling weeds." He boldly implemented a series of reform measures, making this factory the largest profit-maker in the city. However, under the temptation of the corrupt idea of "everything for money," his self-control weakened, and the evil thought of using power for personal gain emerged. When he first approved cotton yarn for money, his hands still trembled; when he first counted the ill-gotten money, he was distracted. But his mental defenses were too fragile, and the desire for money tilted his psychology: "I am already 54 years old. If I don't use my power, it will expire. If I don't take it, I won't get it." Finally, he took the risk and accepted bribes amounting to tens of millions of yuan. A "moment of weakness" made him go further and further, unable to extricate himself.

	Saying these people are "failure at the last moment" seems like an accidental event, but in fact, it is also inevitable. Because the evil "moment of weakness" leading to the collapse of one's thoughts is ultimately due to the existence of unhealthy factors in the subconscious mind finding soil and environment. Why can many people remain unmoved in the face of temptation, while he fell into the water? It seems that one's resistance and immunity are crucial.

	To guard against the recurrence of such "failure at the last moment" tragedies, I think it is not only an urgent matter for celebrities, but also not limited to the economic field. This is because, in the new situation of reform and opening up, the external factors that induce this "moment of weakness" are ubiquitous. For example, there was a saying recently: "Tempt young people with 'democracy,' tempt middle-aged people with material goods, and tempt the elderly with superstition." The infiltration of bourgeois liberalization trends, the temptation of yellow and obscene publications, the golden shackles, and the network of power relations... all can become external factors for "failure at the last moment." In this situation, the most reliable method is still to build an anti-corruption Great Wall in one's mind. I believe that while strengthening various supervision and restraint mechanisms, we must also persistently carry out education for serving the people, patriotism, legal system, clean government, and professional ethics for the broad masses of cadres and the people... so that they can continuously strengthen their learning, self-cultivation, and strengthen their sense of party spirit, legal system, and discipline. While transforming the objective world, they should also transform their subjective world. In this way, they can continuously eliminate those unhealthy ideological sproutings in the bud.

### 警惕“功亏一念”

    警惕“功亏一念”
    严昌琪
    这段时间，报刊常有一些“爆炸性新闻”：如全国劳模、天津自行车二厂厂长李祺祖被判刑；以“重金难买赤子心”闻名于姑苏城的詹钦标走向深渊；辽阳名人熊家庆被依法逮捕……等等。这些“明星”、“标兵”的沉沦，在人群中引起震动。他们的所作所为大大出乎人们的意料。
    据搞政法工作的同志反映，他们在剖析经济罪犯的心态时发现，不少人在第一次作案时，往往是“一念之差”。这个“一念之差”，很值得深思。
    客观地说，这些曾头顶桂冠而后跌入深渊的人中，虽然确有靠投机取巧骗取荣誉者，但也并非个个都是早就心怀鬼胎的坏人。如辽阳市纺织厂厂长熊家庆，曾被人们誉为“以摧枯拉朽气势治理工厂的闯将”。他大胆推行一系列改革措施，使这家工厂成为全市的利润大户。但是，在“一切向钱看”的腐朽思想诱惑下，他的自控能力减弱了，以权谋财的罪恶念头萌生了。他第一次为捞钱而批棉纱时，手还发抖；第一次数着不义之财时，曾神不守舍。但他思想防线太脆弱，贪财的欲望使其心理倾斜了：“我都54岁了，有权不用过期作废，不捞白不捞。”终于，他铤而走险，受贿几十万元之巨。“一念之差”使他越走越远，不能自拔。
    说这些人是“功亏一念”，好像事出偶然，而其实又是具有必然性的。因为那罪恶的“一念之差”之所以导致思想上的崩溃，说到底是由于在潜意识中，不健康的因素找到了存在的土壤与环境。为什么许多人能够在诱惑面前岿然不动，而他却落水了呢？看来，自身的抵抗力、免疫力是至关重要的。
    警惕这种“功亏一念”的悲剧重演，我想不仅是名人的急务，而且也不仅仅限于经济领域。这是因为，在改革、开放的新形势下，诱发这种“一念之差”的外部因素是所在多有的。比如前段有种说法，叫“对青年人诱以‘民主’，对中年人诱以物质，对老年人诱以迷信”。资产阶级自由化思潮侵蚀，黄色淫秽书刊的诱惑，黄金铸成的枷锁，权力编织的关系网……都会成为“功亏一念”的外部因素。在这种情况下，最可靠的办法，还是要从思想上筑起反腐败的长城。我认为，在健全各项监督、制约机制的同时，也要坚持不懈地对广大干部、群众进行为人民服务的教育、爱国主义教育、法制教育、廉政教育、职业道德教育……使他们不断加强学习，加强自身修养，加强党性、法制、纪律观念，在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界。这样，才能不断地把那些不健康的思想苗头消灭在萌芽状态。
