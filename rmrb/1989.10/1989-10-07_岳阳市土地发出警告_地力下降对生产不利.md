From the situation in six counties (cities), two districts, and five farms in our city, it is evident that soil fertility is declining. This is mainly manifested in the following ways: the organic matter content in the soil is decreasing, and the area of low-fertility farmland is expanding year by year. In 1980, the city had 3.392 million mu of arable land with an organic matter content of over 3%. Now, this has decreased to over 1.5 million mu. The reasons for the decline in soil fertility include exploitative management, excessive use of chemical fertilizers, declining benefits from water conservancy facilities, and reduced investment by farmers in the land.

    岳阳市土地发出警告  地力下降对生产不利
    从我市六县（市）、两区、五场的情况看，地力衰变，主要表现是：土壤有机质含量下降，低等肥力的农田面积逐年扩大。一九八○年全市有机质含量在百分之三以上的耕地三百三十九点二万亩，现已减少到一百五十多万亩。地力下降的原因，有掠夺性经营、大量施用化肥、水利设施效益下降、农民对土地的投入减少等。
