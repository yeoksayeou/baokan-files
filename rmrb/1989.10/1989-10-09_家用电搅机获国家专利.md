A new member of China's household electric appliance family—the household electric blender—has been successfully developed by Jiangmen Aoke Household Electric Appliance Company. Recently, it was awarded the Guangdong Provincial Scientific and Technological Achievement Certificate and has obtained a national patent.

This electric blender is compact in design and uses a high-speed electric motor to drive stainless steel blades that chop food into small pieces. It can be used for mincing meat, making batter, and grinding into a paste. Currently, this product has entered mass production and has begun exporting overseas.
