The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR, Willi Stoph, who is also a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, met with Yao Yilin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, and his delegation on October 4 at the Council of Ministers building.

Both sides expressed agreement on many major issues and introduced the situations in their respective countries. They affirmed the achievements of socialist construction in both countries and stressed the need to adhere to the socialist path according to the specific conditions of each country.

Yao Yilin expressed understanding of the current complex situation in the GDR. Stoph reiterated the GDR's party and government's understanding and support for China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. Yao Yilin expressed his thanks for this.

Yao Yilin said that the so-called "sanctions" imposed by some Western countries on China might bring some difficulties, but they would also cause losses for those countries. China will never yield to foreign pressure.

Both sides introduced the achievements of socialist construction in their respective countries over the past 40 years in a sincere and friendly atmosphere.

Klaus Kleber highly praised the comprehensive and in-depth development of relations between the two countries since Erich Honecker's visit to China in 1986. He expressed his belief that cooperation between the two countries in politics, economy, science and technology, and other fields will have even greater development.

Yao Yilin pointed out that the current political situation in China is stable. He said that the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing has shattered the imperialists' dream of restoring capitalism in China. China is willing to develop relations with all countries, but will never yield to the pressure of any country and will never abandon the socialist path.
