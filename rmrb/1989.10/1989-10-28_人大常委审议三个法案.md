The 10th session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress continued its group meetings today to review the draft of the Law on Urban Residents' Committees, the draft amendment to the Environmental Protection Law, and the draft of the Urban Planning Law.

During the review of the draft of the Law on Urban Residents' Committees, the committee members believed that the draft law, after revision, is relatively complete and agreed to pass it at this session of the Standing Committee. Passing this law is very important for the construction of two civilizations in the city.

Commissioner Yuan Xuefen said that the formulation of the Law on Residents' Committees should be based on a summary of historical experience. In the 1950s, residents' committees in various places did a lot of good work. But now, many residents' committees are only after money and have many problems. Therefore, we should review what was done right and what was done wrong, and retain the good things from the past.

Commissioners Zhang Ting, Chen Shuangheng, Chen Xian, Qian Min, Yang Chuguang, and Chen Shunli believed that the draft stipulates that residents' committees should focus on the living, public welfare, and spiritual civilization aspects of residents. Residents' committees engaging in production can easily form small treasuries and increase the number of non-production personnel.

Commissioners Li Xuezhi and Yin Fatang believed that this law should reflect the idea of national equality and friendly coexistence. Commissioners Cao Longhao, Wang Wei, and Peng Qingyuan suggested that the draft should emphasize issues such as family planning and youth education.

During the review of the draft amendment to the Environmental Protection Law, the committee members believed that the key to environmental protection is to act according to the law. Commissioners Aisin Gioro Puyue and Chen Shuangheng pointed out that the importance of environmental protection is well known, but there are many who pay lip service but do not act accordingly. The key is to ensure that the law is followed, enforced strictly, and violations are punished.

Commissioners Yao Jun, Mo Wenxiang, Yi Meihou, and Liu Dongsheng believed that environmental issues are a major international problem, and they are particularly important for a developing country like China. The trial implementation of the Environmental Protection Law over the past decade has played a positive role in China's construction and environmental protection. Economic development and environmental protection should be carried out simultaneously. This draft amendment is much better than the original law. It strengthens the regulations on environmental supervision and adds regulations on limiting the emission of dust.

During the review of the draft of the Urban Planning Law, Commissioner Zhang Ke said that urban planning must strictly control the scale. Whether it is the urban area, suburban area, or new development zone, it is necessary to pay great attention to saving land and rationally utilizing land. The planning standards should be adapted to the level of productive forces and should consider the possibilities of financial and material resources.

Zhang Haimin, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Fujian Provincial People's Congress, who attended the meeting, said that urban construction planning is often the chief's planning, and when the chief changes, the planning also "fizzles out." To prevent this phenomenon from recurring, it is necessary to stipulate in the legal responsibilities the responsibility for arbitrarily violating the planning.

Commissioner Dong Fuzhen said that to make the Urban Planning Law practical and to give full play to the mandatory role of urban planning in urban construction, it is necessary to make clear regulations on land issues in urban construction. It should be clearly stipulated that urban planning can compulsorily requisition land from various units. In addition, due to the development of science and technology, the discovery of new resources, the construction of new railways, and other factors, the nature, scale, and functions of the city will change, so urban planning should consider the long-term development of the city.

The committee members also proposed amendments to some specific clauses of the three draft laws during the review.

　　人大常委审议三个法案
　　认为居委会组织法对城市两个文明建设很重要
　　指出环境保护的关键是一定要按法律规定办事
　　强调城市规划须控制规模与生产力水平相适应
    新华社北京10月27日电  七届全国人大常委会第十次会议今天继续举行分组会，审议城市居民委员会组织法草案、环境保护法修改草案、城市规划法草案。
    在审议城市居民委员会组织法时，委员们认为这个法律草案经过修改，比较完善，同意本次常委会会议审议通过这个法。通过这个法，对城市的两个文明建设很重要。
    袁雪芬委员说，制定居委会组织法，要在总结历史经验的基础上进行。在50年代，各地居民委员会做了一些很好的工作。但现在，许多居委会只是图钱，存在着很大的问题。因此，我们要很好地回顾一下，哪些做得对，哪些做得不对，要把过去好的东西保留下来。
    张挺、陈邃衡、陈先、钱敏、杨初桂、陈舜礼等委员认为，草案规定，居委会应注重居民的生活、公益、精神文明等方面的工作。居委会搞生产，容易形成居委会的小金库并增加脱产人员。
    李学智、阴法唐等委员认为，这个法应该体现民族平等、友好相处的思想。曹龙浩、王伟、彭清源等委员建议，草案对计划生育问题、青少年教育问题应给予强调。
    在审议环境保护法修改草案时，委员们认为环境保护的关键是要按法律办事。爱新觉罗·溥杰、陈邃衡等委员指出，环境保护的重要性，国人皆知，但阳奉阴违者不少。问题的关键是要做到有法必依、执法必严、违法必究。
    姚峻、莫文祥、蚁美厚、刘东生等委员认为，环境问题是一个国际性的大问题，对发展中的中国来说尤为重要。环保法试行十年来，对我国建设、环境保护起了积极的作用。经济发展与环境保护应同步进行。这次的修改草案比原法好得多，它加强了环境监督方面的规定，增加了限制排放防尘物的规定。
    在审议城市规划法草案时，张忱委员说，城市规划，必须严格控制规模。无论市区、郊区或新开发区，都必须十分注意节约土地，合理利用土地。规划标准要与生产力发展水平相适应，要考虑到财力、物力的可能。
    列席会议的福建省人大常委会副主任张海民说，现在的城建规划往往是首长规划，首长一变化，规划也就“泡汤”了。为了防止这种现象重演，应在法律责任里规定任意违反规划的责任。
    董辅礽委员说，为了使城市规划法切实可行，发挥城市规划对城市建设的强制性作用，必须对城市建设中的土地问题作明确规定。要明确规定，城市规划可以强制征用各单位的土地。另外，由于科学技术的发展、资源的新发掘、新建铁路等因素的影响，城市的性质、规模和功能要发生改变，因此，城市规划应从城市的长期发展着想。
    委员们在审议中还对三个法律草案的一些具体条款提出了修改意见。
