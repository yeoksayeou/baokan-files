	Osmanthus trees in a border defense camp in Guangxi's border area have recently displayed a rare phenomenon: blossoming three times in two months, with old flowers yet to fall while new buds are already blooming.

	The camp of a certain border defense regiment near Huadong Town in Jingxi County, Guangxi, has more than 20 osmanthus trees. In previous years, these trees would bloom around the middle of the eighth lunar month, with a flowering period of about 10 days, and by September, the flowers would have fallen and the fragrance would have faded. However, this year, an unusual phenomenon occurred where the flowering period lasted nearly two months. According to observations, since mid-August, the more than 20 osmanthus trees have bloomed three times.
