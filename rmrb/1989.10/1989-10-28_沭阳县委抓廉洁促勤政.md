The leadership of the Stuyang County Committee in Jiangsu Province has been leading by example to promote clean governance and efficient administration, which has significantly improved the work style of the local government.

Over the past two years, Stuyang County has implemented a series of measures to combat corruption. The eight members of the County Committee have strictly adhered to these measures in their work. Whether it is personnel arrangements, planning for labor use, distribution of materials, or approval of housing construction plans, they do not write letters or make special requests, and everything is done openly and subject to public supervision. When county leaders go to work in the grassroots, they insist on having simple working meals of two dishes and one soup, and they do not accept any gifts, including local specialties. The county leaders' exemplary behavior has been emulated by grassroots officials. The long-standing issues of extravagant banquets, letter-writing for favors, and the rush to build private houses have been effectively curbed in Stuyang. According to statistics, in the first half of this year alone, the amount spent on banquets was reduced by more than 100,000 yuan compared to the same period last year.

　　沭阳县委抓廉洁促勤政
    本报讯　江苏省沭阳县委一班人坚持从我做起，抓廉洁促勤政，带动了机关作风的改进。
    沭阳县近两年来，制定了一系列廉政措施，县委成员在工作中身体力行。无论是人事调配，计划用工，还是物资分配，建造房的规划审批，县委常委的8名成员不写条子，不打招呼，全部实行公开，接受群众监督。县委领导到基层工作，坚持吃两菜一汤的工作餐，不接受包括土特产在内的任何礼品。县委领导带头，基层争相效法。过去长期得不到解决的吃喝风、条子风、抢建私房风目前在沭阳基本刹住。据统计，今年上半年光吃喝一项，就比去年同期减少了100多万元。　（陈怀美）
