In recent years, due to various reasons, in some provincial-level party and government agencies and public institutions in our province, the phenomenon of officials' relatives working in the same agency or system has become increasingly prominent, forming a complex network of blood and marital relationships. Recently, we conducted a written survey of the kinship and marital relationships among employees in 56 provincial-level units. Among the 46 provincial-level party, government, and mass organizations surveyed, the number of officials' relatives working in the same agency accounted for 18% of the total number of employees. Among them, the number of relatives of bureau-level officials accounted for 15.5% of the total number of bureau-level employees. The specific situation is as follows:

Spousal relationships: Among the 4,051 employees in the 46 party, government, and mass organizations surveyed, there are 211 couples where both spouses work in the same unit, accounting for 10.4% of the total number of employees. Blood relationships: There are 177 cases where parents and children work in the same unit, 15 cases where siblings work in the same unit, and 2 cases where grandparents and grandchildren work in the same unit. These relatives account for approximately 4.8% of the total number of agency employees. Marital relationships: There are 22 cases where a person works with their daughter's husband in the same unit, 17 cases where a person works with their son's wife in the same unit, and 10 cases where a person works with their parents-in-law in the same unit. These relatives account for approximately 1.2% of the total number of agency employees.

In the 10 bureau-level public institutions surveyed, the number of people with kinship relationships accounted for 25% of the total number of employees. Among them, couples where both spouses work in the same unit accounted for 17.5% of the total number of employees, and parents and children working in the same unit accounted for 4% of the total number of employees.

The above kinship relationships bring many unfavorable factors to the work of the agencies. Although some of the causes are unavoidable, there are also some causes that need attention. For example: employment placement; the policy allowing children to replace parents in the same unit; to accommodate spouses living apart and to place demobilized soldiers; the decentralization of organizational and personnel management powers has created some loopholes, as well as some leaders abusing their power for personal gain. To better combat corruption and strengthen clean governance, measures should be taken to address the kinship relationships within agencies.

　　简析机关人员中的亲属关系
    近几年来，由于种种原因，在我省直一些党政机关和事业单位，干部亲属在同一机关和同一系统工作的现象日渐突出，形成了错综复杂的血缘、姻缘关系网络。前不久，我们对省直56个单位的工作人员血缘，姻缘情况进行了一次书面调查。在被调查的省直46个党、政、群机关中，干部亲属在同一机关工作的人数竟占职工总数的18％，其中厅级干部有亲属关系人数占厅级工作人员总数的15.5％。具体情况是：
    配偶关系：在被调查的46个党、政、群机关4051名职工中，夫妻双方在同一单位的有211对，占整个职工总数的10.4％。血亲关系：父母子女在同一单位的有177人，兄弟姊妹在同一单位的有15人，祖父母孙子女在同一单位的有2名，这些亲属约占机关职工总数的4.8％。姻亲关系：与女婿在同一单位工作的有22名，与儿媳在同一单位工作的有17名，与岳父母在同一单位工作的有10名，这些亲属约占机关职工总数的1.2％。
    在被调查的10个厅级事业单位中，具有亲属关系的人数占职工总人数的25％。其中夫妻双方在同一单位的占职工总数的17.5％。父母子女在同一单位的占职工总数4％。
    上述亲属关系给机关工作带来很多不利的因素，产生的原因虽然有的不可避免，但也有些原因值得注意。如：安置就业；子女顶替的政策允许在本单位内安置；为照顾夫妻分居和安置转业军人；组织人事管理权限下放出现一些漏洞，以及少数领导人以权谋私等。为更好地惩治腐败，加强廉政建设，对机关单位中的亲属关系应设法予以解决。
