In Brazil's largest city, São Paulo, a recent surge in robberies and kidnappings has left many wealthy individuals and businesspeople fearing for their safety. As a result, they are increasingly hiring personal bodyguards at high salaries. This has led to a boom in the bodyguard industry in the city.

Reports indicate that in São Paulo, the monthly salary for a "full-time" bodyguard ranges from eight thousand to ten thousand new cruzeiros (approximately three thousand to four thousand dollars at the official exchange rate), which is several times higher than the salary of a typical government official.

Despite the high pay, finding suitable bodyguards is not easy. At a security service center called Biês, some businesspeople have been looking to hire personal bodyguards for over ninety days without success. At another center, Fonseca Security Services, one hundred and fifty men have recently been hired as private bodyguards, but this still falls short of the demand. Especially after the recent kidnapping of advertising magnate Shalrez, the number of people seeking to hire bodyguards has surged.

The Brazilian media attributes this social phenomenon primarily to the growing insecurity in society. Economic downturns have exacerbated social disorder, leading to an increase in robberies and kidnappings for ransom, thus fueling the rise of the bodyguard industry.

    保镖业——圣保罗的“热门行业”
    在巴西最大的城市圣保罗，近一时期由于抢劫、绑架事件层出不穷，许多富人和企业家担心成为歹徒下手的对象，于是纷纷出高薪征聘贴身保镖，不少青壮汉子受聘，保镖业成了这座城市的一门新兴的“热门行业”。
    据报道，目前在圣保罗，“全天候”贴身保镖的月薪为八千至一万元新巴币（按官价约合三千至四千美元），比一般政府官员的薪水高出好几倍。
    尽管如此，保镖还是不易雇到，在一所名叫比耶斯的“安全服务中心”，部分企业家征聘贴身保镖的期限已经超过九十天，仍然找不到合适的对象。在另一所丰塞卡“安全服务中心”，最近已有一百五十名男子被企业家聘为私人保镖，但也远远不敷需求。特别在不久前广告业巨头沙雷斯被绑架之后，到各家安全中心要求雇保镖的人数剧增。
    巴西报界认为，上述社会现象主要是社会不安全因素所造成的。经济不景气加剧了社会混乱，抢劫和绑架勒索案激增，保镖业应运而兴。　兰才基
