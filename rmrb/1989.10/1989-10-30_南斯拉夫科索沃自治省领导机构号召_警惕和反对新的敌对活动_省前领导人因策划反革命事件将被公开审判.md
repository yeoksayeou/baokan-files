People's Daily, Belgrade, October 28th - Correspondent Yan Zheng reports: Today, the government and the provincial committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) in the Kosovo Autonomous Province of Yugoslavia issued separate statements, calling on the residents and LCY members of Kosovo to be vigilant and resolutely oppose new hostile activities by Albanian nationalist and separatist elements.

The government of Kosovo stated in its communiqué that since October 27, 58 miners from the "Trepča" mine in the Stari Trg area of Mitrovica have been protesting and refusing to leave the mine. This is a continuation of hostile activities in Kosovo, aimed at demanding the release of the former leaders of the autonomous province, including Vllasi and the original leaders of the Trepča mine area, directly pressuring the judicial authorities, and attempting to obstruct the trial of the aforementioned criminals. This premeditated hostile act is also intended to create instability in Kosovo, disrupt public opinion, and reignite the counter-revolutionary events of last November and this February and March. The Kosovo government called on the citizens of the autonomous province and relevant authorities and all government agencies to be vigilant, resolutely stop and crush the above plots, and reiterated that the decision to ban protest gatherings and parades issued in March this year remains in effect, and citizens are not allowed to clash with the public security agencies implementing this decision. The communiqué of the LCY provincial committee also pointed out that the protest by the miners of Trepča is an organized hostile political sabotage activity by Albanian nationalist and separatist elements, aimed at opposing the policies of the LCY, further worsening the situation in the autonomous province, and causing unrest in the country. It called on LCY members to resolutely stop any hostile activities that undermine national territorial integrity.

According to reports, the Mitrovica local court has formally decided to begin a public trial on October 30 for Azem Vllasi and 14 other former leaders of the Trepča mine area. They are accused of inciting and organizing the counter-revolutionary events that occurred in Kosovo last November and this February and March, constituting a criminal case of threatening the state system. Among them, Vllasi had previously held important positions such as Chairman of the Youth League of Yugoslavia, member of the Central Committee of the LCY, Chairman and member of the Provincial Committee of the LCY, and was arrested in March this year and expelled from the LCY in April. After announcing the public trial of Vllasi and others, the former Chairman of the LCY Central Committee, now a member of the Federal Presidency, Shuvari, and some individuals in the Central Committee and the Presidium of the LCY proposed the release of Vllasi, but all were rejected.

　　南斯拉夫科索沃自治省领导机构号召
　　警惕和反对新的敌对活动
　　省前领导人因策划反革命事件将被公开审判
    本报贝尔格莱德10月28日电　记者严正报道：今天南斯拉夫科索沃自治省政府和共盟省委主席团分别发表公报，号召科索沃居民群众和共盟成员警惕并坚决反对阿民族主义和分裂主义分子新的敌对活动。
    科索沃政府的公报指出，铁托米特罗维察区斯塔尔特尔格“特雷普查”矿的58名矿工从27日起举行抗议，拒绝撤离矿井，这是在科索沃的敌对活动的继续，旨在要求从监狱释放自治省前领导人弗拉西和“特雷普查”矿区的原领导人员，直接给司法机关施加压力，企图阻碍对上述犯罪人员的审判。这种有预谋的敌对行径也是为了在科索沃再次制造不稳定局势，扰乱公众舆论，重新挑起去年11月和今年2月与3月的反革命事件。科索沃政府号召自治省的公民以及有关的主管机关和所有的政府机构加强警惕，坚决制止和粉碎上述图谋，并重申今年3月公布的禁止抗议集会和游行的决定仍有效，不允许公民与执行该决定的治安机构发生冲突。共盟省委主席团的公报也指出，“特雷普查”井下矿工的抗议是阿民族主义和分裂主义分子有组织的敌对政治破坏活动，旨在反对南共盟政策，进一步恶化自治省的局势，在全国造成不安。它号召共盟成员坚决制止任何破坏国家领土完整的敌对活动。
    据报道，铁托米特罗维察地方法院已正式决定10月30日开始公开审判阿·弗拉西和“特雷普查”矿区原领导等15人，他们煽动和组织去年11月和今年2月与3月在科索沃发生的反革命事件，构成威胁国家制度的反革命刑事犯罪案件。其中弗拉西曾担任过南青盟主席、南共盟中央委员、共盟省委主席团主席和成员等要职，今年3月被逮捕，4月被清除出共盟。在宣布对弗拉西等人进行公开审判后，原南共盟主席团主席、现联邦主席团成员舒瓦尔以及南共盟中央委员会和主席团中的个别人提出了释放弗拉西的建议，但均遭拒绝。
