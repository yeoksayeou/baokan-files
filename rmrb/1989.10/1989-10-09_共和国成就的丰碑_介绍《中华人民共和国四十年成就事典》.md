Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of all ethnic groups in our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have, through forty years of arduous struggle, achieved tremendous successes in both material and spiritual civilization. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, in just a decade, our national economy has undergone significant changes. By the time of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party, our national income, state fiscal revenue, and average income of urban and rural residents had all roughly doubled. These achievements have attracted the attention of people around the world.

The "Chronicle of Achievements of the People's Republic of China in Forty Years," edited by Professor Peng Qingyuan and published by Shenyang Publishing House, compiles the scattered materials on the achievements of New China's construction from newspapers and publications in the form of a chronicle. It covers political, legal, diplomatic, military, economic, industrial, architectural, agricultural, forestry, hydropower, meteorological, environmental, transportation, postal, foreign trade, financial, educational, scientific and technological, cultural, sports, literary, medical, and social life fields. The book uses concise language and accurate data to reflect the glorious achievements of New China over the past forty years, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and has certain academic reference value. At the same time, this book is of great significance for the people of all ethnic groups in the country to fully understand the achievements of New China over the past forty years and to carry out in-depth socialist and patriotic education. The "Chronicle of Achievements of the People's Republic of China in Forty Years" is a relatively comprehensive record of the achievements of New China in forty years, a reference toolbook. To arrange the achievements of the Republic in the form of a reference book is a first in the country. The feature of this book is to describe the achievements in the form of entries. The book includes a total of 2437 entries. Each entry uses a subheading or theme word to describe the achievements in concise language and charts.

The book stands on the position of historical materialism, with the view that the people create history, and objectively reflects the achievements of New China over the past forty years. Through the achievements listed in the book: the birth of New China, the restoration of its legal status in the United Nations, nuclear tests, the launch of carrier rockets, the national income ranking seventh in the world, the ten-thousand-ton hydraulic press, the positive and negative electron collider, the agricultural production responsibility system, the lifting of three thousand people out of poverty, the improvement of the cultural quality of the whole nation, the satellite launch center... it is not difficult to see that the history of the Republic and the establishment of the Republic's monument are not written by a few "supermen," but by the thousands and millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, cadres, and other laborers who have stood up. Every achievement of the Republic is a condensation of their wisdom and sweat. They are the backbone of the new era of the Chinese nation.

When compiling the achievements of the Republic over the past forty years, the book also conducted a comprehensive comparison. On the one hand, the book compiled the achievements of New China in various aspects that have been leading the world over the past forty years. Such as particle physics, superconductivity research, insulin research, satellite launch and recovery technology, Goldbach conjecture research, Mao's theory... On the other hand, by comparing New China with Old China, and comparing the period after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee with the period before the reform and opening up, the reader can notice a historical fact: in 1949, when the country was founded, Old China left behind a mess of economic problems, a population of more than four hundred million people who were in urgent need of solving the problem of subsistence and were called the "Sick Man of East Asia," and the heavy shackles of feudalism that had been inherited for thousands of years, as well as the international environment of the Cold War and confrontation. It is on this basis that the Communist Party of China led the people of all ethnic groups in the country to struggle hard and achieve remarkable results that have attracted worldwide attention. This is the basic starting point for evaluating the achievements of New China in forty years. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party has led the people of all ethnic groups to take economic construction as the center, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and work together for the modernization of the four aspects. By the time of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party, the national income had doubled and jumped to the seventh place in the world. Of course, in a country of one billion people, it is inevitable to make mistakes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, whether in the past, present, or future. This is a problem in the process of progress. All these, the book has clearly reflected with irrefutable facts, and described the trajectory of New China's progress for people.

    共和国成就的丰碑
    ——介绍《中华人民共和国四十年成就事典》
    邱枫
    中华人民共和国成立以来，我国各族人民在中国共产党领导之下，经过四十年的艰苦奋斗，物质文明和精神文明建设都取得了巨大的成就。特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，在短短的十年里，就使我国的国民经济发生了显著的变化。到党的十三次全国代表大会时，我国的国民生产总值、国家财政收入和城乡居民平均收入都大体上翻了一番，这些成就已引起了世界各国人民的重视。
    由彭清源教授主编、沈阳出版社出版的《中华人民共和国四十年成就事典》，将分散在报刊出版物上有关新中国建设成就的资料，以事典的形式编篡在一起，涉及到政治、法律、外交、军事、经济、工业、建筑、农业、林业、水电、气象、环保、交通运输、邮电、对外贸易、财政金融、教育、科技、文化、体育、文学艺术、医药卫生、社会生活等各个领域。全书用简练的文字、准确的数据，集中反映了新中国四十年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来的辉煌成就，具有一定的学术史料价值。同时，本书对全国各族人民全面了解新中国四十年来的成就，深入进行社会主义、爱国主义教育，也具有重要意义。《中华人民共和国四十年成就事典》，是一部较全面记录新中国四十年成就的资料性检索工具书。将共和国的成就以工具书的形式予以科学的编排，这在国内尚属首创。以词条的方式叙述成就，是该书的一大特色。全书共收入2437个条目。每个词条均以小标题或主题词，用简练的文字图表记述成就事实。
    该书站在历史唯物主义的立场，以人民创造历史的观点，实事求是地反映新中国四十年来的成就。透过书中列举的成就：新中国诞生、恢复在联合国的合法地位、核试验、发射运载火箭、国民生产总值升至世界第七位、万吨水压机、正负电子对撞机、农业生产责任制、三千万人脱贫、全民族文化素质的提高、卫星发射中心……。不难看出，书写共和国历史、为共和国树碑立传的不是个别“超人”，而是站起来的千千万万的工人、农民、解放军、知识分子、干部及其他劳动者。共和国的每一项成就无不凝聚着他们的聪明才智和血汗，他们是新时代中华民族的脊梁。
    该书在收录共和国四十年来的成就时，还进行了纵横全方位的比较。一方面，该书收录了建国四十年来，新中国在世界处于领先地位的各方面的成就。如粒子物理、超导研究、胰岛素研究、卫星发射及回收技术、哥德巴赫猜想研究、修氏理论……；另一方面，以新中国与旧中国相比，以党的十一届三中全会以后同改革开放以前相比，使读者注意到这样一个历史事实：1949年建国时，旧中国留下来的是一个千疮百孔的经济烂摊子，是急需解决温饱并被人称之为“东亚病夫”的四亿多人口，还有那几千年来遗传下来的沉重的封建主义精神枷锁，以及处于冷战、对抗中的国际环境。就是在这样的基础上，中国共产党人领导全国各族人民艰苦奋斗，取得了举世瞩目的成就，这是评价新中国四十年成就的基本出发点。党的十一届三中全会以来，党领导各族人民，以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，万众一心进行四个现代化建设，到党的十三大时，国民生产总值翻了一番，跃居世界第七位。当然，在十亿人口的大国进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，无论过去、现在、还是将来，失误是难免的，这是前进中的问题。所有这些，该书都以无可辩驳的事实做了明晰的反映，为人们描述了新中国进程的轨迹。
