The Qiqihaer Vehicle Factory of the Ministry of Railways has consistently played a central role in ideological and political work, ensuring the stability of the workforce and the completion of production tasks. This factory has exceeded the national plan for 39 consecutive years and has been named an advanced enterprise in ideological and political work for two consecutive years. Recently, the factory's party committee was rated as an advanced grassroots party organization nationwide.

Over the years, the factory's party committee has focused on leveraging political advantages and conducting ideological and political work. After implementing the factory director responsibility system, the party committee eliminated the interference and impact of bourgeois liberalization on ideological and political work, ensuring that the party's organizational structure remained intact and the political work cadre team remained stable. The party committee has consistently educated workers on the current situation, tasks, enterprise spirit, and the spirit of hard work and self-reliance.

In recent years, the factory's party committee has emphasized the role of party members as vanguards and examples, establishing the "five no's" principle for cadre party members: not accepting bribes, not showing favoritism in housing, not promoting relatives, not giving special treatment to family members, and not acting like a boss. When higher authorities allocated a quota for purchasing a luxury car for the factory leaders, they returned it and used the money for production. All 784 party members on the production line are responsible for 287 key quality control points, maintaining a 100% qualification rate. Over the past decade, no party members in the factory have been involved in bribery, defaulting on public funds, or using their power for personal gain.

    齐齐哈尔车辆厂发挥党委核心作用
    职工思想稳定　企业生产腾飞
    本报讯　铁道部齐齐哈尔车辆工厂坚持发挥党委在思想政治工作中的核心领导作用，保证了职工队伍的思想稳定和生产任务的完成。这家工厂持续39年超额完成国家计划，连续两年保持全国思想政治工作先进企业称号。最近，厂党委又被评为全国先进基层党组织。
    这个厂的党委多年来注重发挥政治优势，坚持开展思想政治工作。实行厂长责任制后，厂党委排除了资产阶级自由化对思想政治工作的干扰和冲击，党的机构没有砍掉，政工干部队伍保持了稳定。厂党委坚持对职工进行形势任务、企业精神、艰苦奋斗精神的教育。
    近年来，工厂党委着重发挥党员的先锋模范作用，规定干部党员必须遵守票子面前不伸手、房子面前不徇私、选拔干部不唯亲、亲属子女不特殊、甘当公仆不摆谱的“五不”原则。上级拨给厂领导购买一部超豪华小轿车指标，他们退回了，把购车钱用到了生产上。全厂784名在生产第一线的党员担负着287个关键质量环节的生产，合格率始终为100％。近10年来，厂里的党员无一人行贿受贿、拖欠公款和以权谋私。（刘长河　王瑞光）
