Gansu Province's Propaganda Department and the Gansu Provincial Postal Administration recently issued a joint notice, clearly regulating the subscription of the People's Daily in various regions. It is stipulated that workshops and offices in factories, mines, and enterprises, as well as party committees and governments in rural townships (towns) and their directly affiliated units, military units at the company level and above, and universities and colleges at the department level and above, must ensure the subscription of the People's Daily.

The notice emphasizes that the 1990 newspaper and magazine circulation work must ensure the circulation of party newspapers and magazines. During the subscription collection, targeted guidance work should be done to prevent the phenomenon of spontaneous subscription and to correct the blind subscription situation. All party and government officials in enterprises and institutions, as well as employees who enjoy book and magazine allowances, should use 60% of their book and magazine allowances to subscribe to newspapers and magazines. During the reduction of administrative expenses, subscriptions to party newspapers and magazines should not be "cut."

    甘肃作出明确规定  要求订阅人民日报
    本报兰州10月16日电　记者张述圣报道：甘肃省委宣传部和甘肃省邮电管理局近日联合发出通知，对各地订阅《人民日报》作出明确规定，要求厂矿企业的车间、科室，农村乡（镇）党委、政府及其直属单位，部队连以上单位和大专院校系以上单位，应当保证订阅《人民日报》。
    通知强调，1990年度的报刊发行工作，要确保党报党刊的发行，在收订中要有针对性地做好引导工作，防止订阅报刊出现自流现象，纠正盲目订阅状况。凡党政企事业单位干部和享受书报费待遇的职工，应将书报费的60％用于订阅报刊。在压缩行政经费时，不能在订阅党报党刊上“切一刀”。
