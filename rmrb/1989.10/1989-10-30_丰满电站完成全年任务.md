Fengman Power Station Completes Annual Task

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 29th - (Reporter Chen Guangjun) Fengman Power Station, which is responsible for peak shaving, frequency regulation, and power generation for the Northeast Power Grid, has generated 81,820 million kilowatt-hours of electricity as of the 23rd, completing its annual power generation task more than two months ahead of schedule. The station has also achieved a remarkable record of 800 days of safe operation.

This year, due to lower rainfall, the water level in Songhua Lake has been relatively low, causing the generating units to operate at low water levels. Under these circumstances, the broad masses of workers at the power plant have resolutely followed the dispatching orders of the Northeast Power Grid, maintained their posts, and worked diligently. They have made significant contributions to ensuring the safe and economic operation of the Northeast Power Grid.

　　丰满电站完成全年任务
    新华社长春10月29日电　（记者陈广俊）担负着东北电网调峰、调频和发电任务的丰满发电站，截至23日已发电81820万千瓦小时，提前两个多月完成了全年发电任务，并取得安全运行800天的好成绩。
    今年以来因雨量较少松花湖水位较低，发电机组一直处于低水位运行状态。在这种情况下，电厂广大职工坚决服从东北电网的调度命令，坚守岗位，辛勤工作，为保证东北电网的安全经济运行做出了贡献。
