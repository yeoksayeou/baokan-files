The *USA Today* newspaper recently conducted a poll among African Americans. Many of those surveyed believe that racism still affects various aspects of their lives, often not overtly but in ways that are nonetheless unbearable.

In stores—black customers are discriminated against by salespeople. 44% of the black respondents said they had been treated as potential criminals by salespeople solely because of their skin color.

In schools—most black students attend predominantly black schools, with only a few black students able to attend integrated schools.

In companies and factories—blacks face unequal employment opportunities, finding jobs is difficult, and due to biased hiring standards, black applicants often fail in tests.

In residential areas—70% of blacks live in predominantly black neighborhoods, while only 30% live in ethnically mixed areas.

Additionally, the image of blacks in the media is almost always portrayed as ignorant and uneducated.

The survey report also states that middle-class and above income blacks have more opportunities to interact with whites in their workplaces or personal lives compared to poor blacks. Therefore, they encounter more racial issues. Some blacks say that success in their careers does not exempt them from racial discrimination and prejudice.

    美国种族歧视种种
    《今日美国报》最近在美国黑人中进行了一次民意调查。被调查的许多黑人认为，种族主义在他们生活的各个方面都仍有影响，通常不很露骨，但往往令人难以忍受。
    在商店——黑肤色的顾客受到售货员的歧视。接受调查的44％的黑人说，他们曾被售货员视为犯罪分子，唯一的原因是他们的肤色。
    在学校——大多数黑人中学生在黑人学校或以黑人为主的学校就读，只有少数黑人能进混合学校上学。
    在公司和工厂——黑人就业机会不平等，工作难找，由于录取标准常带有种族偏见，黑人申请者常常在测试中失利。
    居住区域——黑人的70％住在黑人区，只有30％住在民族杂居区。
    另外，黑人在新闻媒介中的形象差不多都被描绘成愚昧无知的样子。
    这份调查报告还说，中等以上收入的黑人，在工作场合或个人生活中，和白人接触的机会比贫穷的黑人多，所以，遇到的种族主义问题也就更多。有的黑人说，事业上的成功并不能使他们避免种族歧视和偏见。
