Xiao Lingcai, who has worked as a teacher, technician, and workshop director, became the director of the Nanchang Automobile Repair Factory five years ago. Now 48 years old, he embodies a sense of continuity and morality, and his reputation for integrity makes him a unifying figure, drawing people together to accomplish tasks. I sought him out to discuss his path to success. He smiled and, after a moment of thought, said something that initially surprised me but ultimately made perfect sense: "I focus on the 'four principles.'"

"The first principle is to focus on the vehicles." Transportation is crucial, and delays can result in significant losses. The automobile repair factory must meet the quality and repair cycle requirements of its customers, addressing their urgent needs. Previously, a major overhaul of a vehicle took a month, but now it only takes 20 days. However, speed alone is not enough; the quality of the repairs must be excellent. He implemented a system of self-inspection, mutual inspection, and team inspections, with rewards and penalties based on performance. Vehicles that do not meet quality standards are not allowed to leave the workshop. Each division also has dedicated quality inspectors. This network of quality inspections has resulted in a vehicle completion rate of over 98.5%, earning the factory the top spot in provincial and municipal repair quality competitions year after year, and receiving numerous awards from the Ministry of Transportation and the provincial and municipal governments. Xiao Lingcai's efforts have brought significant economic benefits to the factory. Last year, the factory achieved 237% of its annual profit target, and from January to July of this year, profits increased by 39% compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, many individual and collective repair shops focus on bribes, kickbacks, and favors, resulting in poor business conditions, with some even forced to close.

"The second principle is to focus on ideas." Two years ago, he learned that the city planned to build an automobile inspection line and immediately thought, "Why not build it in our factory?" After the equipment was imported from Japan, he realized that without skilled workers, even the best equipment would be useless. He sent over 20 workers to Guangzhou for training and enrolled 30 young workers in evening and correspondence courses. He also organized various training sessions within the factory to improve the skills of the workers. Now, the factory has cultivated 138 professional talents and 157 workers with a skill level of five or higher, accounting for 59% of the total workforce.

"The third principle is to focus on housing." "People need a place to live to be happy at work," said Xiao. He used the factory's profits to build several apartment buildings, providing comfortable housing for 75% of the workers.

"The fourth principle is to focus on opportunities." What to do with the surplus labor force in the factory? How to address the unemployment of workers' children? He organized these individuals into a "New Product Development Group" to produce air filters and oil filters, which are in high demand in vehicle maintenance. The factory consumes these products. For the factory, he is always looking for new opportunities. Recently, he took advantage of the sales and technical service centers of the First and Second Automobile Manufacturers located in their factory to provide free "three guarantees" repairs and technical consultations for users. At the same time, he organized a large number of original spare parts, easing the difficulty of purchasing automobile parts in urban and rural areas of Nanchang. He also established sales and technical service centers with the First and Second Automobile Manufacturers, achieving good economic results.

In July of this year, Jiangxi experienced severe flooding. He led the workers to the disaster area to repair vehicles for free, working for 9 consecutive days without accepting meals or accommodations, and even suffered sunburn. He said, "This is a practical way to demonstrate that not all human relationships are about money."

    肖令才的“四子”
    本报记者　赵相如
    当过教师、技术员、车间主任，5年前成了南昌汽车修理厂厂长的肖令才，今年48岁了。承上启下的时代感、道德感，为人处世的信誉感，使他似乎成为一团胶，走到那里就粘住一批人，一起把事儿干好。我找到他，请他说说成功之道，他笑了笑，这个60年代中期毕业的大学生沉思了一阵，竟说了一句令我先是惊诧后是叫绝的话：“我想的、抓的就是‘四子’”。
    “第一抓车子。”交通是先行官，耽误一天损失不小。汽车修理厂要做到质量上、修理周期上满足修车用户的要求，急人所急。原来大修汽车需1个月，如今只需20天。再说，光图快也不行，修的车质量要过硬。他又搞一套职工自检、互检、班组检制度，从中定奖罚，质量不合要求不出班组；各分厂又有专职质量检验员。网络式的质量检验，使全厂修车完好率达到98.5％以上，年年夺得省市修车质量评比第1名，多次受交通部、省市政府的嘉奖。肖令才这一手给全厂带来了巨大经济效益，去年实现利润为年计划的237％，今年1——7月份比去年同期增39％，而不少修车个体户和集体修车厂，把功夫用在送礼、回扣、给好处上，营业情况并不佳，有的只好关门。
      “第二抓点子”。两年前他得知市里要建一条汽车检测线的信息，马上想到：为什么不把这条线建在自己厂里？当设备从日本引进后，他又想：工人如果水平不高再好的设备也白搭，他派了20多名工人去广州培训，同时送30多名青工上电大、夜大，还在厂里举办各种讲习班，提高职工素质。如今全厂培养了各类专业人才138名，五级以上技工157名，这两类人员占全厂职工的59％。“第三抓房子”。“安居才能乐业嘛！”老肖把留给厂里的利润盖了不少宿舍楼，如今全厂75％的职工都有了比较宽敞的套房居住了。
    “第四抓路子。”厂里富余的劳动力怎么办？厂里的工人子女待业在家怎么办？他把这些同志组织起来，成立一个“新产品开发小组”，试制汽车使用中消耗量大的空气滤清器和机油滤清器，生产出来的产品，厂里消化。对厂子，他也不断想新路子。不久前他利用第一、第二汽车制造厂设在他们厂里的销售技术服务中心的优势，在免费为用户进行“三包”修理、技术咨询的同时，组织了大批的原装配件，缓和了南昌城乡买汽车配件难的局面，同时又和一汽、二汽组建了销售技术服务中心，收到了较好的经济效益。
    今年7月，江西发生大水灾。他带领工人去灾区免费修理车辆，一干就干了9天，不吃招待，不住旅社，晒脱了一层皮。他说，这是用实际行动来体现人与人之间不都是金钱关系。
