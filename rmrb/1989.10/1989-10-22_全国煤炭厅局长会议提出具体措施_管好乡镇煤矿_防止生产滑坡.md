	National Coal Bureau Directors Meeting Proposes Specific Measures to Manage Township Coal Mines and Prevent Production Slippage

	Beijing, October 21st - "For township coal mines, we must strengthen industry management, strengthen leadership, stabilize local coal mine operations, and prevent slippage." This was proposed at the National Coal Bureau Directors Meeting held yesterday by the Ministry of Energy.

	In recent years, township coal mines in our country have developed significantly, playing a major role in supporting agricultural and industrial production. However, several problems have emerged, primarily due to a lack of strict management. There has been excessive competition for resources, leading to reckless mining, destruction of resources, reduced recovery rates, and frequent accidents.

	One of the main reasons for these problems is the lack of effective management. The Ministry of Energy requires coal industry management departments to:

	- Clearly define the main responsibilities and tasks of industry management. To implement the State Council's spirit of industry management, which includes unified planning, organizational coordination, service provision, and supervision, the Ministry of Energy authorizes the China Local Coal Mine Joint Development Company to manage the national local coal mines.

	- Establish a sound industry management structure. In townships with an annual production of over 10,000 tons, coal management stations should be set up as branches of the county coal bureau, serving as the grassroots units for industry management.

	- Clearly define necessary industry management authorities. These include: the approval authority for mine establishment and design mining; the authority to revoke mining permits and close or halt production for illegal mining; the authority to approve the qualifications of mine managers; the authority to allocate planned materials; and the authority to plan and transport external shipments.

	- Conduct thorough rectification and cleaning. Strictly prohibit unlicensed mining, prohibit the sale or disguised sale of resources, prohibit private contracts that disregard safety, prohibit illegal operations or resale, and prohibit arbitrary levies.

### 全国煤炭厅局长会议提出具体措施  管好乡镇煤矿　防止生产滑坡

　　全国煤炭厅局长会议提出具体措施
　　管好乡镇煤矿　防止生产滑坡
    本报北京10月21日讯　记者刘燮阳报道：“对乡镇煤矿要强化行业管理，切实加强领导，稳住地方煤矿阵地，防止滑坡。”这是在昨天能源部召开的全国煤炭厅局长会议上提出来的。
    这些年来，我国乡镇煤矿有了很大的发展，对支援工农业生产起了很大的作用。但是，也出现了不少问题，主要是缺乏严格的管理，相互争夺资源，乱采滥掘，不少资源被破坏，回采率降低，事故不断发生。
    出现上述问题的一个重要原因是管理工作不落实。能源部要求煤炭行业的管理部门：
    ——明确行业管理的主要职责和任务。为了贯彻国务院有关行业归口管理要统筹规划、组织协调、提供服务和进行监督的精神，能源部授权中国地方煤矿联合经营开发公司行使归口管理全国地方煤矿的职能。
    ——要健全行业管理机构。凡年产万吨以上的乡镇，设立煤炭管理站，作为县煤炭局的派出机构，也是行业管理的基层单位。
    ——明确必要的行业管理权限。一是开办煤矿定点划界、设计开采的审批权；二是对违法开采的矿井、有吊销开采证和封闭、停产权；三是对各类矿长任职资格的审定权；四是计划内物资分配权；五是外调运输计划权。
    ——认真进行清理整顿。严格禁止无证开采，严禁出卖或变相出卖资源，严禁不管死活的私人契约，严禁非法经营或转手倒卖，严禁摊派。
