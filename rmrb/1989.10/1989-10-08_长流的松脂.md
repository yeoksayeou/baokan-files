The Guangdong Province Deqing County Forest Chemical Factory was established in 1944. For 40 years, it has been solely producing rosin products. The production of rosin is subject to the yield of resin and market factors. Additionally, with outdated equipment and backward technology, the factory has long been in a precarious situation.

Xiao Mingli arrived at this chemical factory in the summer of 1983. Coincidentally, the international market demand for rosin products significantly decreased that year, resulting in 5600 tons of rosin being unsold. The entire factory had to rely on loans to pay wages. In this critical moment, he made an important decision: to focus on technological renovation, rely on scientific and technological advancements to deepen product processing, and optimize the enterprise's product structure.

By the end of 1983, they undertook the construction themselves, restoring and expanding the production of the long-idle hard resin workshop. This increased the series of rosin secondary processed products to more than 12 kinds, with an annual output of over 4000 tons. This alone increased the enterprise's value by over 10 million yuan.

In 1986, they learned that the international market urgently needed "refined natural resin." They rushed to Nanjing, seeking guidance, and introduced technology from the Nanjing Forest Chemical Research Institute. They jointly established the first refined natural resin production workshop in China, with an annual output of 3000 tons of refined natural resin, reaching advanced world standards, and a value of over 10 million yuan. The products were sold in large quantities overseas, making the factory one of Guangdong Province's leading foreign exchange earners.

In 1987, they conducted a comprehensive technological renovation of the camphor workshop, increasing the annual production capacity from the original 500 tons to 1000 tons. In the face of a severe shortage of the main raw material for resin, Xiao Mingli led the technical team to research and develop a substitute technology using other raw materials, opening a new path for resin production nationwide. As the technological renovation deepened, the deep-processed products of the Forest Chemical Factory accounted for more than 64% of the total output value, a unique achievement in the industry. In 1987, he also decided to invest 8 million yuan to build a continuous production line for rosin steam distillation.

This move sparked intense debate within and outside the factory. Some said, "Brother factories have been trying for over three years without success. Can we succeed in just over a year?" Others said, "As early as 1968, our factory tried rosin steam distillation production, but it ended in failure. What makes you, Xiao Mingli, think you can do it?" At the mobilization meeting, facing the doubts in the workers' eyes, Xiao Mingli emotionally said, "It's true that brother factories have not succeeded, but that doesn't mean we can't. It's also true that our factory failed in the past, but that doesn't prove we can't succeed today. Now, our factory's engineering and technical personnel have significantly improved their knowledge and practical experience. Things are different now, and after repeated scientific verification and calculation, we are fully capable of mastering it. I hope you understand and support me. Let's work together, ensure quality and quantity, and guarantee the timely completion of the production line. This is our lifeline!"

The hall erupted in applause. The battle began. In less than two years, Xiao Mingli spent 335 nights on the construction site. After more than a year of hard work, the rosin steam distillation continuous production line successfully produced its

    长流的松脂
    陈俊年
    广东省德庆县林产化工厂建于1944年，40年一贯制，只单一生产松香产品。松香生产要受松脂收成和市场因素的制约，加上设备陈旧，技术落后，林产化工厂长期处在变幻难测的险境中。
    肖明礼于1983年夏来到这个化工厂，恰巧国际市场对松香产品需求量大大减少，当年该厂松香滞销5600多吨，全厂靠贷款发工资。危难之中他作出一个重要决策：狠抓技术改造，靠科学技术搞产品深度加工，优化企业的产品结构。
    1983年底，他们自行施工，使长时停产的硬树脂车间得以恢复和扩大生产，使松香二次加工系列产品增加到12种以上，年产量达4000多吨。仅此一项，企业增值1000多万元。
    1986年，他们获悉国际市场急需“精制天然树脂”的信息后，赶赴金陵，投门拜师，从南京林产化工研究所引进技术，联合创建我国第一座精制天然树脂生产车间，年产精制天然树脂3000吨，质量达到世界先进水平，产值1000多万元。产品大量销往海外，该厂一跃成为广东省创汇大户。
    1987年，他们又对樟脑车间进行全面技术改造，使年产能力由原来的500吨提高到1000吨。在树脂主要原材料严重紧缺的情况下，肖明礼带领技术人员研究出用其他原料生产的替代技术，为全国树脂生产开创了新路。随着技术改造的深化，林产化工厂的深度加工产品已占总产值的64％以上。这在全国同行中是独一无二的。1987年他又作出投资800万元、建设松香蒸气法连续化生产线的决策。
    此举，引起了厂内外激烈的争论。有的说：“兄弟厂家搞了3年多没能投产，我们用1年多的时间行吗？”有的说：“早在1968年，我们厂就试过松香蒸气法生产，结果一败涂地，你肖明礼有多大能耐？”在动员大会上，肖明礼面对职工疑虑的目光，动情地说：“兄弟厂未办成，是事实，但我们未必就办不成。我们厂过去未办成，也是事实，但不能证明今天也办不成。现在，我们厂工程技术人员的学识水平和实践经验都有很大提高，今非昔比，而且经过反复科学论证和测算，我们完全有能力驾驭它。希望你们理解我、支持我，同舟共济，保质保量，保证按时建成生产线。这是我们共同的生命线！”
    掌声轰鸣。鏖战打响了。在不到两年的时间里，肖明礼在工地上度过了335个加班之夜。经过1年多的艰苦奋斗，松香蒸气法连续化生产线终于在1988年5月30日一次试产成功。从此，德庆县林产化工厂结束了40多年土炉土锅生产松香的历史，一座现代化的林产化工企业巍然屹立在西江之滨。
    1988年，德庆县的松林资源遭受历史上罕见的特大虫害，松脂产量比1987年减少45％，然而这个厂各种硬树脂产量、樟脑产量、精制天然树脂产量等都大幅度增长，全年实现税利1270万多元，比上年增加34．23％。这一年，德庆县林产化工厂荣获国家二级计量合格单位，肖明礼本人则荣获全国“五一”劳动奖章和广东省特等劳模称号。
