The People's Armed Police will start using "Police Officer Certificates" and "Civilian Staff Certificates" on October 20, 1989, with the approval of the State Council and the Central Military Commission.

The People's Armed Police's Police Officer Certificates and Civilian Staff Certificates are modeled after the "People's Liberation Army Officer Certificates" and "People's Liberation Army Civilian Staff Certificates." Both are rectangular in shape with a dark green, textured cover. The upper part of the cover features an embossed police emblem, and the lower part is stamped with "State Council of the People's Republic of China, Central Military Commission." The certificates are issued by political departments at the brigade level and above and serve as official identification for police officers and civilian staff in the People's Armed Police.
