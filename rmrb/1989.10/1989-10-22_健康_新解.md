In the past, people's traditional understanding of "health" was simply "being free from illness." However, today, health experts both in the East and the West agree that the interpretation of "health" should be more comprehensive and richer. This means that in addition to being free from disease, it should also include or involve various psychological, social, and lifestyle factors. Experts point out that a healthy person, in addition to having a robust physique, should also possess the following "characteristics":

A scientific lifestyle. A "healthy person" should avoid any habits that are harmful to physical health (such as drug abuse, smoking, drinking, gambling, etc.), should not be picky about food, should not indulge in snacks, should engage in regular physical exercise, and should have one or two hobbies (such as music, literature, stamp collecting, gardening, chess, photography, etc.). They should also get enough sleep (but not oversleep).

Maintaining mental health. One should be able to engage in work, study, and other activities with a full spirit and a happy mood. This means that for many people, what is often seen as a "burden" of work or study tasks becomes, for a "healthy person," a way to realize self-worth and enjoyment. Additionally, one should be good at adjusting their mental state and have the ability to pull themselves out of emotional lows such as depression, pain, and sadness.

Having a normal social circle. A "healthy person" cannot be a solitary and reclusive individual. They should be able to interact harmoniously with superiors, colleagues, subordinates, neighbors, friends, and family in life. Of course, this does not mean they should be perfect and liked by everyone, but rather that they should enjoy interacting with others and be skilled at adjusting various relationships when problems arise in social interactions.

Paying attention to one's physical needs. A person cannot go through life without ever getting sick. What is important is to learn to "prepare for the unexpected" and regularly pay attention to one's physical needs and changes in any part of the body. For example, one should be able to recognize when they need more sleep or rest, when they need to change their diet, or when they need to increase exercise, and respond to these needs in a timely manner (such as seeking medical treatment or changing lifestyle habits). Of course, we should not go to the extreme of being constantly worried about illness, but we should know that those who are indifferent to their own physical condition rarely live long.

A positive outlook on life. If we understand "health" in a deeper and broader sense, it should also include a sense of ambition and dedication, a love for nature, an appreciation for beauty, a pursuit of truth, a reverence for greatness, and a respect for the weak. This means that one's actions are completely in harmony with their fundamental values.

　　“健康”新解
　　唐若水
    过去，人们对“健康”的传统理解仅是“安然无恙”；但今天，不论是东方还是西方的健康学家都一致认为，对“健康”的解释应更丰富、更全面，即除了意味着摆脱疾病外，还应包括或涉及种种心理、社会和生活方式等因素。专家们指出，健康的人除了具有强健的躯体外，同时还应具备以下“特点”：
    科学的生活方式。一个“健康的人”应不沾染任何有损身体健康的恶习（如吸毒、抽烟、酗酒、赌博等），不偏食，不嗜好零食，坚持体育锻炼，有一、二种业余爱好（如音乐、文学、集邮、园艺、下棋、摄影等），睡眠充足（但不睡懒觉）。
    保持心理健康。能精神饱满又愉快地投入工作、学习等活动。这就是说，对相当一部分人来说无异于“负担”的工作、学习任务在“健康者”心中已升华为实现自我价值的一种乐趣。此外，他还应善于调节自己的心理状态，有能力把自己带出沮丧、痛苦、悲哀等情绪的低谷。
    有正常的社交圈。一个“健康的人”绝不可能是个性格孤僻的孤独者，他应在生活中融洽地与上司、同事、下级、邻居、朋友、亲人相处。当然这不是说他应是个完美无缺、处处受人欢迎的人，而只是说他乐于与他人打交道，而且在社交中如出现问题他又擅长调适各种关系。
    关注自己的身体需要。一个人不可能一辈子不生病，重要的是学会“居安思危”，经常注意到自己的身体需要和身体某部出现的变化。如，能发现自己需要更多的睡眠或休息，需要变换食物品种，需要增加锻炼等，并对此及时作出反应（如求医服药或改变生活习惯等）。当然，我们也不必走向极端，时时无病自扰，但要知道，对自己的身体状况漠不关心者中很少有长寿的。
    积极的人生观。如果把“健康”作更深刻、更广义的理解，那还应包括进取心和事业心，对大自然的热爱，对美丽的赞赏，对真理的追求，对伟大的敬畏以及对弱者的尊重——这就是说，他的所作所为是和他的基本价值观完全协调的。
