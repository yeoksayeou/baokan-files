After the Paris International Conference adjourned, especially in late September when the so-called "final withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia" took place, the Vietnamese authorities mobilized all their propaganda machinery to launch a significant propaganda campaign. On one hand, they claim to be the guardians of peace in Cambodia, asserting that their invasion of Cambodia in the past was "completely just, reasonable, and in line with human conscience, a righteous and honorable action." Now, their withdrawal of troops "demonstrates Vietnam's sincerity in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Cambodian issue." On the other hand, they fiercely attack China, accusing China of consistently "obstructing the political resolution process of the Cambodian issue" over the past decade, and even slandering China for currently taking "dangerous actions to intensify the Cambodian civil war crisis," and so on.

Anyone with a basic understanding of the Cambodian issue and who is not biased will see that Vietnam's propaganda is completely a distortion of facts. Everyone knows that the Cambodian issue was caused by Vietnam's aggression. Countless pieces of evidence prove that the one obstructing a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political resolution to this issue is not someone else, but Vietnam itself. Because the comprehensive political resolution of the Cambodian issue includes two fundamental aspects: Vietnam's genuine and complete withdrawal of troops and the establishment of a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk. These two aspects are closely related and indispensable. People only need to look at Vietnam's actions on these fundamental issues to understand how ridiculous its self-praise is and how unreasonable and unjustified its anti-China rhetoric is.

Firstly, on the issue of troop withdrawal, the Vietnamese authorities have repeatedly created deceptions. Since Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Cambodia at the end of 1978, the United Nations General Assembly has year after year passed resolutions with an overwhelming majority, demanding that Vietnam immediately and unconditionally withdraw all its troops and restore Cambodia's independence, neutrality, and non-aligned status. However, as a member of the United Nations, Vietnam has completely ignored these resolutions, not only refusing to implement them but also maliciously slandering them. Starting from 1982, under increasing international pressure, Vietnam has announced several "partial withdrawals," but each time it was just a trick of "rotating" troops. At the end of September this year, Vietnam claimed that the "last soldier" of its last batch of invading troops had withdrawn from Cambodia. But the actual situation is completely different. Many reliable pieces of evidence show that Vietnam has left at least 30,000 troops in Cambodia, who have been re-equipped and integrated into the puppet army in Phnom Penh, and have left a large number of weapons and equipment. There are also a considerable number of Vietnamese party and government officials serving as so-called advisors in various administrative levels of the Phnom Penh regime. Not to mention that among the more than 1 million illegal Vietnamese immigrants in Cambodia, many Vietnamese militia and intelligence personnel are hidden. In early October, the Cambodian anti-Vietnamese resistance forces captured 5 Vietnamese soldiers in the western region of Cambodia, which ruthlessly exposed the lie of Vietnam's claim of having "completely withdrawn" from Cambodia.

The problem is that this so-called "final withdrawal" is unilateral, without strict and effective international supervision and inspection under the auspices of the United Nations, nor with the assistance and supervision of the Cambodian patriotic military and people. Under such circumstances, the authenticity of the withdrawal is highly questionable. For a period of time, Vietnam has been strongly opposing the reasonable proposal of an international supervision mechanism under the auspices of the United Nations, even putting forward unreasonable preconditions. Vietnam's efforts to obstruct the United Nations' supervision of its withdrawal are self-evident.

More notably, on the issue of preventing Vietnamese troops from returning to Cambodia under any pretext or form, Vietnam has not made any credible commitments or guarantees. Vietnamese officials sometimes solemnly declare that the withdrawn troops will not return to Cambodia under any circumstances; other times, they change their tune, saying that if necessary, Vietnam will invade Cambodia again. Judging from Vietnam's inconsistent and untrustworthy diplomacy over the years, such flip-flopping attitudes hide some malicious intentions. It is reported that this time, the Vietnamese troops withdrawn from Cambodia are mostly stationed in the jungle areas near the Vietnam-Cambodia border, ready to return at any time, which is evidence of this.

Therefore, no matter how much Vietnam boasts about the "significance" of this "final withdrawal," it is reasonable and justified for the international community not to acknowledge it.

Secondly, on the issue of Cambodian national reconciliation, Vietnam refuses to accept the reasonable proposal to establish a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk and strives to maintain the control of its Phnom Penh puppet regime. The Vietnamese authorities bear an irresponsible responsibility for eliminating the consequences of the aggression. After Vietnam's genuine and complete withdrawal of troops, how the future government of Cambodia will be composed is a major issue related to whether the country will restore peace or fall into civil war. Today's reality in Cambodia is that there are four political forces coexisting, and each political force has its own armed forces.

Therefore, whether it is the Cambodian patriotic military and people or the international community, they all advocate for the establishment of a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk during the transitional period from the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops to the holding of general elections, to be responsible for the freezing and reduction of the four-party armies and to prepare for the future general elections. This is the most realistic and effective way to ensure Cambodia's peace. Any attempt by one party to monopolize power or exclude any party, or any attempt to form a two-party or three-party coalition, will not work and will inevitably lead to a dangerous situation. On this crucial issue, Vietnam has always been singing a different tune. On one hand, it hypocritically declares that the future of Cambodia should be decided by the Cambodians themselves; on the other hand, it proposes a plan through its agent Hun Sen in Phnom Penh that fully reflects Vietnam's intentions, advocating for the maintenance of the status quo during the transitional period, allowing the puppet regime in Phnom Penh to continue to exist; establishing a "Supreme Leadership Committee" that only advocates for the four-party coalition, allowing Prince Sihanouk to be a nominal leader, while the current Phnom Penh authorities hold the real power; not allowing the Khmer Rouge to share power. Vietnam and the Hun Sen regime attempt to obtain through such means what they failed to achieve on the battlefield in the past ten years, which is of course impossible.

Whether from the perspective of restoring peace in Cambodia or maintaining stability in Southeast Asia, the two fundamental aspects of a comprehensive political resolution to the Cambodian issue—Vietnam's genuine and complete withdrawal of troops and the establishment of a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk—should be closely related and inseparable. Without Vietnam's genuine and complete withdrawal of troops, there is no way to talk about peace in Cambodia; without eliminating the consequences of the aggression after the withdrawal, Cambodia will not be at peace. Therefore, the international community generally supports Prince Sihanouk and many countries, including ASEAN, in advocating for the need to seek a comprehensive and lasting solution. However, on this issue, the Vietnamese authorities have also been playing tricks. They first openly declared that they would only discuss the "international part" of the Cambodian issue, leaving the "domestic part" to be resolved by the four parties in Cambodia. When the call for a comprehensive solution became louder internationally, they picked up the slogan of "comprehensive solution" to change the subject, replacing the fundamental content of "establishing a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk" with "effectively preventing the return of the Pol Pot genocide regime." This is clearly a deliberate move, aiming to evade the responsibility it should bear for eliminating the serious consequences of the 10-year war of aggression against Cambodia, and at the same time using this as an excuse to exclude the Khmer Rouge, allowing the Hun Sen faction to seize power.

The Vietnamese authorities recently claimed that after this "final withdrawal," the nature of the Cambodian issue would undergo a "fundamental change," as if it were no longer related to them, and that if external forces continued to support the resistance forces, it would be "interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs" and "stirring up civil war." This is obviously a very absurd logic. The fact is that Vietnam has not yet completely withdrawn its troops, and the tens of thousands of Vietnamese soldiers left behind are still fighting against the Cambodian anti-Vietnamese resistance forces. Moreover, the puppet regime in Phnom Penh continues to exist and is still controlled and manipulated by Vietnam. Under such circumstances, how can it be said that the nature of the Cambodian issue of aggression and anti-aggression has undergone a "fundamental change"? As recently stated by the leaders of the three factions of the Cambodian resistance forces, under such circumstances, the struggle of the Cambodian people is not a "civil war," but a continuation of the struggle against Vietnamese invaders. This just struggle will naturally continue to receive assistance from various countries.

Over the past 11 years, the Chinese government, together with relevant countries that uphold international justice, has made unremitting efforts to seek a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political resolution to the Cambodian issue. China has done this entirely to uphold justice and has never sought any private gain. This is well known. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that once Vietnam genuinely withdraws all its troops from Cambodia under international supervision and the Cambodian issue is comprehensively, fairly, and reasonably resolved, China will, together with relevant countries, fulfill its obligation to stop military assistance to all parties in Cambodia. After the establishment of the four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk, China will only interact with that government and respect the results of the future elections it oversees. China is willing to work with other countries to provide international guarantees for Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, neutrality, and non-aligned status. The Chinese government's open and upright attitude and correct stance have been widely welcomed and supported internationally, while the Vietnamese authorities have distorted the facts and maliciously slandered, putting the hat that should be worn by themselves on China's head. What can Vietnam gain from such actions other than further exposing its true face of obstructing the political resolution process of the Cambodian issue?

    是谁在阻碍柬埔寨问题政治解决
    本报评论员
    巴黎国际会议休会之后，特别在9月下旬所谓越南军队“最终全部撤出柬埔寨”前后，越南当局开动所有宣传机器，发动了一场规模不小的宣传攻势。它一方面标榜自己是柬埔寨和平的维护者，称它当年出兵柬埔寨“是完全正义、符合道理和人类良知的光明正大的行动”，如今撤军“体现了越南和平解决柬埔寨问题的诚意”；一方面又大肆攻击中国，指责中国十年来一贯“阻止柬埔寨问题政治解决的进程”，甚至诬蔑中国目前又在采取“强化柬埔寨内战危机的危险行动”，等等。
    凡对柬埔寨问题稍有常识而又不怀偏见的人都会看到，越南的这种宣传完全是颠倒黑白。谁都清楚地知道，柬埔寨问题是越南侵略造成的。无数的事实证明，阻挠全面、公正、合理政治解决这个问题的不是别人，而正是越南自己。因为柬埔寨问题的全面政治解决包括两个基本方面，即越南真正全部撤军和成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，这两者是紧密相关、缺一不可的。人们只要看一看越南在这些基本问题上的所作所为，就可以明了它的自我吹嘘是多么的荒唐可笑，它的反华叫嚣是多么的蛮横无理。
    首先，在撤军问题上，越南当局一再制造骗局。自越南1978年底对柬埔寨发动全面侵略战争以来，联合国大会年复一年地以压倒多数通过决议，要求越南立即无条件地撤走全部军队，恢复柬埔寨独立、中立和不结盟地位。但是，作为联合国成员国的越南，对这些决议竟置若罔闻，不仅拒不执行，而且肆意诬蔑。从1982年起，迫于愈加强大的国际压力，越南宣布过几次“部分撤军”，但每次都是玩弄部队
  “换防”把戏。今年9月底，越南宣称它最后一批侵柬部队的“最后一名士兵”已经撤出了柬埔寨。但实际情况完全不是如此。许多可靠证据表明，越南在柬埔寨至少留下了3万人的部队，换装后编进了金边伪军，并留下大批武器装备。还有相当数量的越南党、政干部在金边政权的各级行政机构中充当所谓顾问。更不用说在柬埔寨的100多万越南非法移民中还隐藏着许多越南民兵和特工人员。10月初，柬埔寨抗越部队在柬西部地区抓获5名越军士兵这个事实，无情地戳穿了越南声称已从柬埔寨“全部撤军”的谎言。
      问题又在于，这次所谓的“最后撤军”是单方面的，既没有联合国主持下的严格、有效的国际监督与核查，也没有柬埔寨爱国军民的协助监督与核查。在这种情况下的撤军，其真实性大可怀疑。一个时期以来，越南对由联合国主持国际监督机制的合理主张，一直竭力加以反对，甚至提出了无理的先决条件。越南所以竭尽全力地阻止联合国对它撤军实行监督，其用心不言而喻。
    更值得注意的是，在越军不得以任何借口、任何形式重返柬埔寨这个问题上，越南也没有作出令人可信的承诺和保证。越南的高级官员一会儿冠冕堂皇地宣称，撤出的越军在任何情况下都不再重返柬埔寨；一会儿则又改口说，今后如有必要，越南仍会再次出兵柬埔寨。从越南这些年外交的多变性和不讲信用来看，这种出尔反尔的态度埋伏着某种杀机。据悉，此次从柬埔寨撤出的越军，大部分驻扎在越柬边境附近的丛林地带，随时准备返回，就是一个证据。
    因此，不管越南吹嘘这次“最后撤军”是多么“意义重大”，国际社会不予承认是有充分理由的，是理所当然的。
    其次，在柬埔寨民族和解问题上，越南拒不接受成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府的合理主张，竭力谋求由它的金边傀儡继续掌握实权。越南当局对消除侵略的后果负有不可推卸的责任。在越南真正全部撤军后，柬埔寨未来政权如何组成，是关系到这个国家恢复和平还是陷入内战的大问题。今天柬埔寨的现实是，同时存在四种政治力量，每一种政治力量又都分别拥有自己的武装。
  因此，不论柬埔寨爱国军民，还是国际社会，都主张在从越南撤军到举行大选的过渡时期里成立一个以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，负责对四方军队实行冻结和裁减，并筹组未来的大选。这是保证柬埔寨和平最现实、最有效的办法。任何由一方独家掌权或排除任何一方的做法，任何搞两方联合或三方联合的企图，都是行不通的，而且势必导致出现危险局势。在这个事关重大的问题上，越南一直是大唱反调的。它一面假惺惺地宣称，柬埔寨的未来由柬埔寨人自己去决定，一面又通过它在金边的代理人洪森抛出完全反映越南意图的方案，主张过渡时期“维持现状”，金边傀儡政权继续存在；成立一个仅仅标榜四方联合的非权力机构“最高领导委员会”，让西哈努克亲王当挂名领袖，由现金边当局掌实权；不允许红色高棉分享权力。越南和洪森政权企图通过这样的办法来得到过去十年在战场上想得到而没能得到的东西，这当然是办不到的。
    不论从恢复柬埔寨和平还是从维护东南亚地区稳定出发，全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的两个基本方面——越南真正全部撤军和成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府——应是紧密相关、不可分割的。越南不真正全部撤军，柬埔寨和平无从谈起；撤军后而没有消除侵略的后果，柬埔寨同样不得安宁。因此，国际社会普遍支持西哈努克亲王和东盟等许多国家提出的必须寻求一项全面持久的解决办法的主张。可越南当局在这个问题上也是一再玩弄花招。它先是公开宣称只讨论柬埔寨问题的“国际部分”，而“国内部分”留待柬埔寨四方自行解决。当国际上主张全面解决的呼声越来越高的时候，它又接过“全面解决”的口号偷梁换柱，把“成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府”这一基本内容偷换成“有效地防止波尔布特灭种制度重返”。这完全是别有用心的，其目的是为了逃脱它对消除10年侵柬战争造成的严重后果所应该承担的责任，同时以此为借口排除红色高棉，以使洪森一派掌握大权。
    越南当局日前声称，在它这次“最后撤军”之后，柬埔寨问题的性质将发生“根本变化”，似乎不再与它有关，外部若继续援助抵抗力量就是“干涉柬埔寨内政”、“挑动内战”。这显然是一种非常荒谬的逻辑。事实是越南迄今并没有全部撤军，留下来的数万名越军士兵仍在同柬埔寨抗越部队作战。何况，越南扶植的金边伪政权继续存在，而且仍然受越南控制和支配。在这种情况下，怎么能说柬埔寨问题的侵略与反侵略性质发生了“根本变化”呢？正如柬埔寨抵抗力量三方领导人最近所郑重申明的，在这种情况下柬埔寨人民的斗争决非“内战”，而是抗击越南侵略者斗争的继续。这一正义斗争自然会继续得到各国的援助。
    在过去的11年中，中国政府同主持国际正义的有关各国一起，为谋求全面、公正、合理政治解决柬埔寨问题作了不懈的努力。中国这样做，完全是为了主持正义，从来不谋任何私利。这是有目共睹的。中国政府还一再申明，越南一旦在国际监督下真正从柬埔寨全部撤军，柬埔寨问题得到全面、公正、合理的解决，中国将同有关国家一道承担义务，停止对柬埔寨各方的军事援助。在以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府成立后，中国将只同该政府发生交往，并尊重由它主持的未来大选的结果。中国愿同其它国家一起对柬埔寨的独立、主权、中立、不结盟地位作出国际保证。中国政府这种光明磊落的态度和正确立场受到国际上广泛的欢迎和支持，而越南当局却颠倒黑白，恶意中伤，把明明应该戴到自己头上的帽子硬扣在中国头上。这样的行径，越南除了愈加暴露自己阻碍柬埔寨问题政治解决进程的真实面目外，还能捞到什么呢？
