Heart attack patients often die because they cannot be rescued in time (rescue must be initiated within four to five minutes after cardiac arrest). In the United States alone, 400,000 people die from this each year.

Recently, a hospital in New York, USA, successfully designed a device called the "Heart Attack Savior" MD telephone. This device is about the size of a briefcase and is usually placed next to the home telephone. If a patient suddenly experiences a heart attack, they only need to activate the switch, and the MD will automatically dial the hospital. Meanwhile, family members or the patient themselves can place an electrode on the chest, and the electrocardiogram will be transmitted to the hospital for the doctor to analyze and diagnose. Afterwards, the doctor will instruct the patient's family members to use an attached device to perform electrical stimulation to rescue the patient.

According to reports, this magical MD telephone successfully saved the lives of thousands of heart attack patients in the first three months of this year.

　　MD电话
　　——心肌梗塞者的救星
    心肌梗塞者常因抢救不及（抢救不能晚于心脏停搏四至五分钟之后）而死于非命。仅在美国一地，每年就有四十万人因此而死去。
    但最近，美国纽约一家医院成功地设计了一种被称作“心肌梗塞者救星”的MD电话。这种装置如公文包大小，平时就置于家中电话旁，患者如心肌梗塞突发，只要启动开关，MD即自动拨通医院电话。同时家人或病人自己还可将一根电极放在胸口，心电图即传至医院以便让医生分析诊断。此后医生则通过电话指令病人家属用一种附加器对病人作电刺激作抢救。
    据报道，这种神奇的MD电话今年头三个月就成功地拯救了数千名心肌梗塞患者的生命。
