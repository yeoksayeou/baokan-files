Title: Empty Runs – A Waste of 5.9 Billion Yuan

Currently, the waste caused by long-distance empty runs in China's road freight transport is astonishing. Statistics show that the national empty run rate is approximately 48%, resulting in an annual direct economic loss of 5.9 billion yuan.

On one hand, there is a shortage of transport capacity, and on the other hand, there are long-distance empty runs in road freight transport, which not only waste transport capacity but also consume fuel unnecessarily. This is a major contradiction that has long plagued China's transportation sector. What is worrying is that this irrational phenomenon is still on the rise. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Land Transport Administration, the number of vehicles entering and exiting Shanghai in 1988 was 5.38 million trips, an increase of 4.04 million trips compared to 1982. However, the load rate has been declining year by year, with 1988 being 18 percentage points lower than 1982, at only 58.9%. This indicates that the number of empty-running vehicles is still increasing.

Investigations reveal that this situation is due to the lack of information exchange, poor coordination, and lack of coordination among various regions and units. Currently, there are many empty vehicles on the roads, often running empty on the return trip after delivering goods to another region, and running empty on the way to pick up goods from another region. Meanwhile, the situation where the transport demand exceeds the transport capacity and vehicles are difficult to turn around often occurs. If vehicle owners and cargo owners can communicate with each other and achieve coordinated loading, not only can the current unscientific situation of road transport be changed, but transport capacity can also be improved and fuel can be saved.

Strengthening cargo coordination and improving vehicle load rates is an urgent task for the transportation industry. It is necessary to stipulate that for materials exceeding a certain transport distance, the principle of coordinated loading should be adopted. This requires the establishment of institutions that serve society, act as "matchmakers" for vehicle and cargo units, and build bridges, so that the fragmented cargo transport market gradually moves towards specialization, cooperation, and group operation.

Currently, some transportation units in cities such as Xuzhou and Wuhan have established various coordinated loading service institutions and have begun to cooperate, with initial results. However, to reverse the situation of long-distance empty runs of transport vehicles, it is necessary to organize all vehicles in society uniformly and break through regional limitations to establish a national cargo coordination network, seeking a comprehensive balance of transport capacity and demand, and improving the overall efficiency of transportation. Even consideration should be given to treating railways, highways, pipelines, waterways, and aviation as a complete transportation entity from a macro perspective, rationally laying out and coordinating the overall arrangement, developing intermodal transport to promote the efficient operation of trucks, and effectively alleviating the pressure of transport capacity in China.

### 空驶——五十九亿元的浪费

    空驶——五十九亿元的浪费
    目前我国公路货运长途空驶造成的浪费十分惊人。资料表明，全国空驶率约48％，每年直接经济损失高达59亿元。
    一方面是运力紧张，一方面是公路货运长途空驶，既损失运力，又徒耗油料，这是长期困扰我国交通部门的一大矛盾。令人忧虑的是，这种不合理的现象仍呈上升趋势。据上海市陆上运输管理处统计，1988年进出上海的车辆数为538万辆次，比1982年增加404万辆次；而重载率却逐年下降，1988年比1982年低18个百分点。仅为58.9％。这表明，空驶的车辆还在增加。
    据调查，这种局面是因各地区、各单位信息闭塞、协作不力、互不配载造成的。现在公路上空载的车很多，往往是往外地送货返程空放，赴外地拉货去时空跑，而各地运量大于运力、车辆难以周转的情况又时常发生。如果车主、货主能够相互通气，实现配载，不仅可以改变目前公路运输不科学的局面，又能提高运力，节省燃料。
    加强货运配载，提高车辆实载率，是运输业的当务之急；有必要规定凡超过一定运距的物资，原则上应实行配载运输。这就需要建立面向社会，为车、货单位当“红娘”、牵线搭桥的机构，使松散的货运市场逐步走向专业化、协作化、集团化。
    目前我国徐州、武汉等地一些交通运输单位已建立了各种配载服务机构，也开始有所协作，并初见成效。但要扭转运输车辆长途空驶现状，必须把全社会的车辆统一组织起来，并冲破地区间的局限，组建全国性的运货配载网络，以寻求运力运量的综合平衡，提高交通运输整体效益；甚至应考虑从宏观上把铁路、公路、管道、水路和航空等各种不同的运输方式作为一个完整的运输整体，合理布局、统筹安排，发展联运以促使货车多拉快跑，从而有效地缓解我国运力紧张的压力。
