The invention of a new technology often involves twists and turns, and its development and promotion are rarely smooth sailing. The latest example is the digital audio tape recorder, which has long been barred from the European and American markets until recently gaining approval to be sold there.

The digital audio tape, abbreviated as DAT in English, is about the size of a credit card and can record 2 hours of music. Its recording quality is unmatched by ordinary tape recording technology. Everyone knows that laser discs use digital recording technology to record music that is almost flawless because, during playback, a laser scans the disc instead of a traditional turntable using a needle to scratch the record. If music is transferred from a laser disc to a digital audio tape, the copy will not be distorted. This is because digital recording technology is fundamentally different from traditional recording technology.

Traditional tape recorders and turntables use what is known as analog recording technology. During recording, sound waves are recorded as magnetic signals on the tape, and during playback, the magnetic signals are converted back into sound waves, resulting in hissing noises and inevitable distortion. Digital recording technology is different. It uses the "0" and "1" combinations of computer information to store sound wave signals, and during playback, it regenerates different sounds. Because the chips in digital recorders process this information at a rate of thousands of times per second, the human ear cannot distinguish the intervals in the sound waves, and thus no hissing noise is produced.

Indeed, digital audio tapes represent a significant breakthrough in audio technology and should have been rapidly promoted long ago. However, there is a conflict of interest between the Western music industry and the Japanese technology industry, and it has remained outside the European and American markets to this day. The European and American audio industry views digital recording technology as a threat, striving to block it because they fear that all laser music discs on the market will be freely copied, resulting in losses exceeding $1.5 billion. The American audio industry has also been lobbying in Congress to prevent digital audio tapes from entering the U.S. market. The "International Federation of the Phonographic Industry," which represents the interests of the European and American audio industry, has been negotiating with Japanese digital audio tape and recorder manufacturers for over two years without reaching an agreement.

Recently, this new technology recording equipment has finally overcome the obstacles. The European and American audio industry and Japanese recorder and turntable manufacturers have reached an agreement on the entry of digital audio tapes and recorders into the European and American markets. The agreement stipulates that digital recorders must be equipped with anti-copying circuits. These digital recorders can leave a code on the copy and recognize the code in the copy to refuse recording. Therefore, these recorders do not prevent music lovers from copying digital audio tapes from laser discs but prevent commercial-scale piracy of music products.

Historically, stereo technology in the 1970s and laser disc technology in the 1980s both faced resistance. This time, the entry of digital audio tapes and recorders into the European and American markets is called "breaking the sound barrier," marking a new stage in the development of audio technology. The first batch of digital recorders and tapes will enter the European and American markets by the end of this year.

　　新音响技术将进入欧美市场
　　张允文
    一种新技术的发明总要历经曲折，而其发展和推广也往往不是一帆风顺的。最新一例就是数字式录音机及声带长期被拒于欧美市场之外，直到最近才获准将在欧美出售。
    数字式声带英文名字简称DAT，只有信用卡大小，可录制2小时音乐，其录音效果是普通磁带录音技术无法比拟的。大家知道，激光唱片使用数字式录音技术录下来的音乐几乎是完美无缺的，因为放音时使用激光扫描，不像传统唱机那样用唱针磨擦唱片。如用数字式声带从激光唱片转录音乐，复制品是不会失真的。原因在于数字式录音技术完全不同于传统的录音技术。
    传统的磁带录音机和唱机使用的是所谓摹拟式录音技术。录音时声波作为磁信号记录在磁带上，放音时磁信号再转为声波，会出现嘶嘶声，难免失真。数字式录音技术与此不同。它是使用电脑信息中“0”、“1”两个数字的组合把声波信号储存起来，放音时再生不同的声音。由于数字式录音机中的芯片以每秒数千次的速度处理这些信息，人耳无法分辨声波中的间歇，不会产生嘶嘶杂音。
    诚然，数字式声带是音响技术的一大突破，理应早得到迅速推广，但出售音乐的西方和出售新技术的日本存在利益冲突，迄今它仍在欧美市场之外。欧美音响业视数字式录音技术为洪水猛兽，竭力要加以阻挡，是因为担心市场上出售的激光音乐唱片都将被任意复制，造成的损失将高达15亿美元以上。美国音响业也一直在国会游说，阻止数字式声带进入美国市场。主要代表欧美音响业利益的“国际唱片、声带制造业联盟”同日本的数字式录音机、声带制造商就此进行了两年多的谈判，迟迟达不成协议。
    最近，这种新技术录音设备终于突破了阻力。欧美的音响业同日本的录音机、唱机制造商就数字式声带和录音机进入欧美市场达成了协议。协议规定，数字式录音机必须安上防复制的线路。这种数字式录音机能在复制品中留下暗码，并能辨认出复制品中的暗码而拒绝录音。因此，这种录音机不妨碍音乐爱好者从激光唱片复制数字式声带，但无法再从复制品再复制新的声带。换言之，它容许个人小规模的复制，但防止商业性的大规模剽窃音乐制品。
    从历史上看，70年代的立体声技术、80年代的激光唱片技术都遇到过阻力，这次数字式录音机和声带将进入欧美市场被称为“突破了音障”，标志着音响技术发展的新阶段。今年年底第一批数字式录音机和声带将进入欧美市场。
