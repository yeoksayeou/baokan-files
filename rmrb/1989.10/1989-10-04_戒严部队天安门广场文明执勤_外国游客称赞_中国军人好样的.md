Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 2nd.

Since early July, martial law troops in Tiananmen Square have warmly received nearly 20,000 tourists from the United States, Japan, Canada, West Germany, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Their civilized duty and polite demeanor have earned them high praise from foreign tourists. This unit began its martial law duties in Tiananmen Square in mid-June. All the soldiers maintain a neat appearance and have not allowed a single troublemaker to enter, while also doing their best to facilitate the people who come to visit the square. They have also taken good care of foreign tourists in many ways. They pick up lost items and return them, help others, and patiently answer questions from tourists. They remain humble and avoid arrogance and impatience.

In the past three months, the martial law troops in Tiananmen Square have returned 40-plus wallets and items they found to foreign owners, provided first aid to 70-plus sick foreign tourists, and refused 80-plus times to accept money and gifts from foreign tourists. On the morning of September 26th, after observing the civilized duty of the martial law troops in the square, an American tourist gave a thumbs up and, in broken Chinese, said: "Chinese soldiers, well done."

    戒严部队天安门广场文明执勤
    外国游客称赞“中国军人好样的”
    据新华社北京10月2日电（通讯员李全茂、吴子敬）7月初以来，天安门广场戒严官兵热情接待了来自美国、日本、加拿大、联邦德国、苏联等国游客近两万人次。他们文明执勤、礼貌待人，深得外国游客称赞。这个部队于6月中旬到天安门广场执行戒严任务，全体官兵军容严整，既不放进一个破坏分子，又力所能及地方便前来广场参观的人民群众。对外国游客同样多方面关照。他们拾金不昧，助人为乐，遇有游客询问，总是耐心回答；他们不亢不卑，戒骄戒躁。
    近3个月里，天安门广场戒严官兵40多次将拣到的钱包、物品想方设法送还外国失主，70多次抢救治疗患病的外国游客，80多次拒收外国游客的金钱和物质酬谢。9月26日上午，一位美国游客在察看了广场戒严官兵文明执勤的情况后，伸出大拇指，用生硬的汉语说：“中国军人，好样的。”
