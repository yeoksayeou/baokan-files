People's Daily, Beijing, October 10th.

	The China National Coal Mining Corporation and the All-China Coal Mining Geological Workers' Union recently held a telephone conference, calling on coal industry workers to launch a campaign of "learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, surpass the advanced."

	This year, the situation in China's coal industry is excellent, with the expected annual coal production to exceed 1 billion tons by the end of the year. By the end of September, the total company had already overproduced by more than 11.7 million tons. Safety conditions have continued to improve, and the overall labor efficiency has reached 21.15 tons per worker. However, significant challenges remain.

	The telephone conference stated: Launching the "learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, surpass the advanced" campaign is an effective way to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the workers. The total company system has 272 people named as national energy industry labor models by the Ministry of Energy and the All-China Coal Mining Geological Workers' Union, 16 people named as national energy industry special labor models, and 104 grassroots units named as national energy industry advanced collectives. Their advanced deeds should be widely publicized and learned from, striving to produce more coal and make greater contributions to the country.

    学先进　比先进　超先进
    统配煤矿系统力争多超产
    本报讯　记者刘燮阳报道：中国统配煤矿总公司和全国煤矿地质工会最近召开电话会议，号召煤炭战线职工掀起“学先进、比先进、超先进”的热潮。
    今年，我国煤炭战线形势很好，预计年底原煤产量可突破10亿吨大关。总公司到9月底已超产1170多万吨，安全状况持续好转，全员效率已达到每工21.15吨。但是，面临的困难仍然很大。
    电话会议说：开展“学先进、比先进、超先进”是充分调动职工劳动积极性的有效办法。总公司系统有272人被能源部和全国煤矿地质工会命名为全国能源工业劳模，有16人被命名为全国能源工业特等劳动模范，有104个基层被命名为全国能源工业先进集体。要大张旗鼓地宣传、学习他们的先进事迹，力争多产煤，为国家作出更大贡献。
