Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th.

There is only one China, and this is our unshakable stance. On October 23rd, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that due to the Belizean government's violation of the principles and commitments in the 1987 Sino-Belize Joint Communiqué on establishing diplomatic relations, and its establishment of so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities, the People's Republic of China government has decided to suspend diplomatic relations with Belize. On October 24th, Premier Li Peng reiterated China's government's resolute stance against any attempt to create "one China, one Taiwan" and "two Chinas" during a meeting with the outgoing and incoming ambassadors from seven countries. The world has seen that China's stance on the Taiwan issue is clear and unshakable. There is only one China in the world, the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. Recognizing this established fact is a prerequisite for any country to establish and maintain diplomatic relations with China. China is a principled country, and in its international activities, it has always clearly upheld its principles. Today, it is utterly impossible to expect China to make concessions on such a major principle as allowing the creation of "two Chinas."

In recent times, the Taiwan authorities, disregarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and the future of peaceful reunification of the motherland, have been resorting to all means to hasten the implementation of so-called "flexible diplomacy" and "dual recognition," blatantly creating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan." According to various sources, the Taiwan authorities, in order to "establish" or "re-establish" diplomatic relations with certain countries, have used every trick in the book, even to the point of sacrificing their dignity. For example, they have privately offered economic benefits to certain officials in some countries; some of their "dignitaries" have sneaked into certain countries through back doors to engage in activities, even disguising their identities to infiltrate a country's reception of foreign guests. As for bribing economically struggling small countries with large sums of money to "establish" or "re-establish" diplomatic relations, this is despised by the international community. Even Taiwan newspapers have pointed out that this is merely "buying diplomacy with money." Some of Taiwan's authorities, instead of being ashamed of their despicable methods, are proud of their so-called "diplomatic breakthroughs." However, any action that is detrimental to the peaceful reunification of the motherland and goes against the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, including those in Taiwan, is unpopular and is opposed by all far-sighted Chinese people at home and abroad. Taiwan newspapers have pointed out that this "diplomatic strategy of creating two Chinas" has "long-term implications," which "inevitably make the concept of China's territorial integrity increasingly vague and the consciousness of China's unification increasingly weak among people in Taiwan." If this continues, it will "develop into a de facto two Chinas, and eventually may evolve into an independent situation," therefore, the so-called "pragmatic diplomacy" is "really dangerous." Public opinion indicates that there are not a few people in Taiwan who hold such views.

As a socialist power, China has always pursued an independent and peaceful foreign policy, advocating the development of friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China's significant role and influence in world affairs are undeniable. The world has seen that China has always firmly supported and safeguarded the interests of the Third World countries and peoples. The long-standing friendly relations between China and Third World countries have had a major impact internationally. It is unwise for a few countries to adopt short-term behavior in their relations with China for the sake of immediate gains, which is not in the fundamental interests of these countries. We believe that these countries, through the development of the world situation and the assessment of their own interests, will recognize and change their current erroneous policies, sever their official and diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and restore and develop friendly relations with the People's Republic of China.

It is noteworthy for all Chinese people at home and abroad that in the past year or so, the Taiwan authorities have been increasingly adopting actions to create "one China, one Taiwan" and "two Chinas." If such actions are allowed to continue, they will greatly encourage the "Taiwan independence" forces that split the motherland, and hinder the progress of the peaceful reunification of the motherland. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor, both at home and abroad, have the responsibility to stop the Taiwan authorities from betraying the fundamental interests of the nation.

The "flexible diplomacy" policy pursued by the Taiwan authorities, although temporarily successful in some countries, is doomed to failure. Taiwan's return to the motherland and the realization of national reunification are the inevitable trends of history, and such a day will surely come. We advise the Taiwan authorities to act from the perspective of achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland and not to continue down the path of creating "one China, one Taiwan" and "two Chinas." All patriotic Chinese people at home and abroad are watching the actions of the Taiwan side.

　　只有一个中国是我们不可动摇的立场
　　新华社评论员
    中国外交部10月23日宣布，由于伯利兹政府违背1987年中伯建交联合公报的原则和对台湾问题的承诺，同台湾当局建立了所谓“外交关系”，中华人民共和国政府决定中止同伯利兹的外交关系。10月24日，李鹏总理在会见七国离任和新任的驻华大使时，重申了中国政府坚决反对任何图谋制造“一中一台”和“两个中国”的严正立场。全世界都已看到，中国政府在台湾问题上的这一立场是毫不含糊的和不可动摇的。世界上只有一个中国，中华人民共和国政府是中国唯一合法政府，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。承认这一确定不移的事实，是任何一个国家同中国建立和保持外交关系的前提。中国是一个有原则的国家，在国际活动中从来旗帜鲜明地坚持自己的原则，今天企望中国在允许制造“两个中国”这样重大的原则面前退让，是根本不可能的。
    最近一个时期来，台湾当局置中华民族的根本利益于不顾，置祖国和平统一的前途于不顾，不择手段地加紧了推行所谓“弹性外交”、“双重承认”的步伐，公然制造“两个中国”、“一中一台”。据各方面的消息，台湾当局为了同某些国家“建交”、“复交”，耍尽了手腕，甚至到了不惜抛弃脸面的地步。例如，它私下给了某些国家的某些当权人士以许多经济实惠；它的一些“政要”，以走后门的办法溜到一些国家去活动，甚至隐瞒身份混进某一国家的领导人接见外宾的场合。至于以重金为饵，诱骗经济困难的小国同它“建交”、“复交”，更为国际社会所不齿，连台湾报纸都认为，这只不过是“拿钱买外交”而已。台湾的一些当权者，不以自己的手法卑鄙为耻，反而沾沾自喜于所谓“外交突破”的“成绩单”。但是，任何不利于祖国和平统一、违背包括台湾人民在内的全国人民的根本利益的行为，都是不得人心的，都为海内外一切有远见的中国人所反对。台湾报纸就指出，这种“策动‘两个中国’的外交策略”的“长远影响方面”，“难免使得在台湾地区的国人对中国领土完整的概念愈趋模糊，对中国统一的意识也愈趋淡薄”，“长此以往”，就会“变成事实上的两个中国，最后就可能演变成独立的局面”，因此，所谓“务实外交”“实在危险”。舆论表明，在台湾岛内持上述看法的人不在少数。
    中国作为一个社会主义大国，一贯奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展同一切国家的友好关系。中国在世界事务中的重大作用和影响是任何人都无法否认的。举世都看到中国一贯坚决支持和维护第三世界国家和人民的利益，中国和第三世界国家长期十分友好的关系，在国际上起着重大影响。极少数国家因眼前小惠而在同中国的关系上采取短期行为，显然是不明智的，是不利于这些国家的根本利益的。相信这些国家从世界局势发展和对本国利害的衡量中，会认识和改变当前这种错误的政策，中断同台湾的官方关系、外交关系，恢复并发展同中华人民共和国的友好关系。
    值得海内外一切中国人注意的是，近一年多来台湾当局变本加厉地采取制造“一中一台”、“两个中国”的行动。如果听任这种行动发展下去，将极大地助长分裂祖国的“台独”势力，使祖国和平统一大业的进展受到破坏。海内外一切炎黄子孙，都有责任起来制止台湾当局对民族根本利益的这种叛卖。
    台湾当局推行的“弹性外交”政策，虽然在个别国家暂时得逞，但肯定是没有前途的，必然要彻底失败的。台湾回归祖国，实现国家的和平统一，是历史发展的必然趋势，这样的一天必然要到来。我们奉劝台湾当局从实现祖国和平统一的大局出发，不再沿着制造“一中一台”、“两个中国”的道路滑下去。海内外所有爱国的中国人正注视着台湾方面的动作。
