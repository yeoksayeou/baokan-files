Billions of Farmers Advance Along the Path of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
— In Commemoration of the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China

Forty years ago, on the eve of the founding of New China, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson wrote in a letter to U.S. President Truman: "The problem of the people's food is the first problem that every Chinese government must face. Up to now, no government has solved this problem." He believed that the Communist Party of China could not solve the food problem and that the Chinese people could only rely on American flour to live. Forty years have passed. The facts have proven this secretary's prophecy wrong. On 7% of the world's arable land, we have created the miracle of feeding 22% of the world's population. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the generations-long struggle of the Chinese people for subsistence has been basically solved, and billions of farmers are advancing victoriously along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics!

Great Achievements

Forty years is just a moment in the long river of human history, but China's rural areas have undergone earth-shattering changes.

In 1988, the production of major agricultural products was several times higher than the highest production year before the founding of the nation. Among them, grain production was 2.6 times higher, cotton was 4.9 times higher, sugar cane was 10.3 times higher, and aquatic products were 7.1 times higher. The total production of grain, cotton, and meat all ranked first in the world. Over the past 40 years, although the national population increased from 540 million to 1.1 billion, and the arable land per capita decreased from 2.7 mu to 1.4 mu, the amount of major agricultural and sideline products per capita has greatly increased. Grain production increased from 209 kg to 355 kg, cotton from 0.8 kg to 3.7 kg, oil crops from 4.7 kg to 12 kg, and pork, beef, and mutton from 3.6 kg to 19.8 kg.

The conditions for agricultural production have significantly improved. The traditional agriculture characterized by the use of human and animal labor and manual tools is gradually transforming into modern agriculture. The country has built more than 80,000 reservoirs, more than 5,300 large and medium-sized irrigation districts of over 10,000 mu, and the effective irrigated area of farmland has reached more than 660 million mu. Agricultural machinery has gone from nonexistent to widespread use, and agricultural science and technology have continued to advance. The single-industry structure of the countryside, which has persisted for thousands of years, is gradually being broken. While the planting industry is developing, the relatively backward forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries are also accelerating their development, increasing their share of the total agricultural output value from 17% in 1949 to 44.1% in 1988. The rise of township enterprises is particularly noteworthy. They not only absorb a large number of surplus rural laborers, provide hundreds of billions of yuan for agricultural construction, but also play an important role in foreign exchange earnings.

Based on the development of production, the living standards of billions of farmers continue to improve. In 1988, the per capita net income in rural areas was 545 yuan. After deducting the factor of price increases, it was 2.1 times higher than in 1978, with an average annual increase of 11.8%. Over the past 10 years, rural areas have built a cumulative 6.7 billion square meters of new housing. For every 100 rural households, 75 have moved into new homes, and the per capita living area has increased from 8.1 square meters to 16.6 square meters.

A Tortuous Path

The achievements are brilliant, but the path is tortuous.

In the process of leading hundreds of millions of farmers to embark on the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we have experienced both the joy of success and the pain of mistakes. It was only after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee that we gained a relatively complete understanding of "Chinese characteristics."

After the founding of New China, from 1950 to 1952, the Party led the farmers to carry out large-scale land reform nationwide, completely abolishing the feudal land system that had ruled China for 3,000 years. About 300 million farmers were allocated approximately 700 million mu of arable land and a large amount of production materials, greatly enhancing the farmers' enthusiasm for labor, and agricultural production quickly recovered and developed. In 1952, the total agricultural output value reached 46.1 billion yuan, a 48.4% increase over 1949, and the production of major agricultural products all exceeded the highest historical levels before liberation.

After the land reform, the countryside was still dominated by dispersed and backward small-scale peasant economies. This situation was at odds with the further development of production, with farmers themselves escaping poverty, and with national industrialization. To address this, the Party guided farmers to organize through mutual aid teams, primary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives, step by step, to walk the path of common prosperity. Although the steps from primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives were a bit too fast, agricultural production continued to develop during this period.

In 1958, after the advanced cooperatives had been established for only two years and were not yet consolidated, the people's commune movement was launched nationwide. Due to the characteristics of "big and public" in the people's communes, which violated the principle that production relations should adapt to productive forces, exceeded the awareness level of the peasant masses, and due to high targets, blind commands, wind of exaggeration, and the "wind of communism," as well as natural disasters, agricultural production suffered a serious setback. In 1960, grain production dropped to the level of 1951. The Central Committee promptly noticed the mistakes in economic work and made timely adjustments to the people's commune system and other rural policies, restoring vitality to the vast rural areas.

The 10 years of turmoil during the "Cultural Revolution" once again set back Chinese agriculture. Under the interference of the "leftist" ideology of class struggle, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers was dampened, and the rural economy was basically stagnant. In 1978, the per capita grain production in the country was still only about the level of 1957, nearly 1/4 of the production team members had incomes below 50 yuan, the average collective accumulation of each production brigade was less than 100,000 yuan, and some places could not even maintain simple reproduction.

The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee became a great historical turning point. This meeting followed the Marxist line of thought, summarized the experiences and lessons of the past 30 years, affirmed the achievements, pointed out the mistakes, proposed solutions, and specially formulated the "Draft Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the Acceleration of Agricultural Development." Since then, the countryside has carried out and continues to carry out a profound reform on the basis of rectifying past mistakes. Compared with the past 30 years, the greatest achievement of the 10-year reform is: continuously improving socialism and taking a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, beginning to give full play to the superiority of socialism.

First, under the premise of maintaining the socialist public ownership economy as the mainstay, various economic components, including individual and private economies, are allowed to exist and develop. Economic, administrative, and legal means are used to both promote the positive role and restrict the negative role of individual and private economies.

Second, within the socialist cooperative economy, there are various forms of operation, and the responsibility system is widely implemented. This system separates land ownership from usage rights, introduces family operation into the cooperative economy, forming a dual-layer management structure that unifies producers and operators, rights and responsibilities, and combines unity and division, giving full play to both the advantages of the collective and the enthusiasm of the family. At the same time, in areas with conditions, the appropriate scale operation is promoted in a stable manner according to the principle of farmers' voluntariness.

Third, the rural industrial structure has changed from a single structure to a three-tier structure: planting industry; large agriculture including forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries; and non-agricultural industries including township enterprises, commerce, transportation, construction, and services. The situation where 800 million farmers are only engaged in agriculture is beginning to change.

Fourth, the planned economy and market regulation are combined. Under the premise of adhering to the national plan, market, price, contract, and other economic, administrative, and legal means are used to improve the government's regulation of the rural economy.

Fifth, based on the traditional advantages of Chinese agriculture, modern scientific and technological achievements are vigorously applied.

Sixth, the four cardinal principles are adhered to, and material civilization construction and spiritual civilization construction are combined. While focusing on material civilization construction, Marxist ideals, beliefs, and moral education are used to educate farmers, cultivating a generation of socialist new farmers with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

The path that China's agriculture has taken since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is correct when measured by the standard of productive forces. From 1978 to 1988, China's rural economy made breakthrough progress. The total agricultural output value increased by an average of 6.2% per year, more than double the annual growth rate of 2.7% in the previous 26 years.

Valuable Experience

The decision to accelerate agricultural development made by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is an important document summarizing the Party's experience in leading agriculture. It contains the following two passages:

"The primary task before us is to concentrate our efforts to quickly develop the currently backward agriculture, because agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and the rapid development of agriculture is the fundamental condition for achieving the four modernizations."

"The primary starting point for determining agricultural policies and rural economic policies is to fully give play to the superiority of the socialist system and to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of China's 800 million farmers."

The essence of these two passages can be understood as correctly treating agriculture and correctly treating farmers. These "two correct treatments" are particularly important content in the Party's experience in leading agriculture, and they have guiding significance now and in the future.

In May 1982, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, when introducing China's economic construction experience to the head of state of Libya, used vivid and popular language to eloquently explain the importance of emphasizing agricultural development. He said: "No matter what happens in the world, as long as the people have enough to eat, everything will be fine."

History has forcefully proven this point. Over the past 40 years, whenever agricultural production developed, the country's situation was relatively good, and whenever agricultural production stagnated or declined, the country's situation was not good. At the end of 1978, soon after the decade of turmoil ended, the national economy was on the brink of collapse. The central government took hold of the link of revitalizing agriculture to drive the entire national economy forward.

In implementing the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between the two major industries of industry and agriculture. Some of our comrades are not unaware of this and are not opposed to the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, but out of the good wish to achieve industrialization as soon as possible, they often unconsciously prioritize heavy industry over light industry in their specific work. In the new situation, it must be further clarified: developed industry must be based on developed agriculture, and it cannot be thought that agriculture is no longer the foundation once industry has developed. Recently, the State Council's published industrial policy once again clearly stated that agriculture is a key industry for national priority investment. These major policies and guidelines, we must conscientiously implement.

In connection with correctly treating agriculture, it is also necessary to correctly treat farmers. Eight hundred million farmers are the main body of agricultural development and the basic factor of stability and unity. It can be said: if farmers are not stable, the country is not stable; if farmers are not rich, China is not rich.

The 40 years of positive and negative experiences tell us that to correctly treat farmers, on the one hand, we must educate them in socialism, guide them to take the socialist path, and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual; on the other hand, we must fully care for their material interests in the economy and genuinely guarantee their democratic rights in politics.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the spark of the household contract responsibility system lit by a production team with only a dozen households in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, spread like wildfire across the country. A fundamental reason for this is that the household contract responsibility system, while adhering to socialism, cares for and respects the material interests and democratic rights of farmers. The household contract responsibility system has three phrases: "After fulfilling the state's quota, retaining the collective's share, the rest is one's own." These three phrases not only indicate the correct handling of the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, but also meet the farmers' demand for autonomy in production and distribution. This makes farmers, from their own interests, turn agriculture into their own cause, generating an internal driving force for production development.

Our Party has been closely connected with farmers since its founding, and farmers have always been the natural allies of the working class. The democratic revolution relied on the support of farmers to achieve victory; the socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up also cannot do without the support of farmers. Therefore, we must pay attention to the interests of farmers, improve the relationship with farmers, and further strengthen the support of industry for agriculture and the support of cities for the countryside. We must continuously take practical measures in politics, economy, science, education, culture, and other aspects to consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants.

We communists have always been dialectical. When celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we must, on the one hand, see the brilliant achievements of China's agricultural front, and on the other hand, not overlook the difficulties and problems on the road ahead.

Currently, China's agricultural productivity is still relatively low, and the material, cultural, and scientific and technological foundations of the entire countryside are still relatively weak; the commodity economy under the socialist system is still in its infancy, and there is a lack of experience in how to properly handle the combination of planned economy and market regulation; due to different conditions, the development of various regions is very uneven, and several million farmers in some remote mountainous areas still have not solved the problem of subsistence; especially in recent years, the fluctuating situation of major agricultural products such as grain and cotton has not been reversed.

In the long term, China's per capita resource endowment is not much, and with the increase in population, industrial development, and the improvement of urban and rural consumption levels, this resource shortage contradiction will become more acute, and it will be difficult to fundamentally solve it before significant breakthroughs are made in science and technology.

However, difficulties and problems will not defeat us. Facing difficulties is to continue to advance, and we have no reason to be pessimistic or discouraged. Currently, many favorable factors and conditions for overcoming difficulties are before us: Over the past 40 years, we have formulated a relatively complete set of policies and guidelines for developing the rural economy; we have created and accumulated a lot of valuable experience in developing agricultural production; we have established a powerful and complete industrial system; within agriculture, including agricultural water conservancy construction, the material conditions are also much stronger than before; China's agricultural production level is still very low, so the potential for agricultural science and technology to increase production is great. We believe that the hundreds of millions of farmers who have made immortal contributions in the democratic revolution and the past 40 years of socialist construction will, under the leadership of the Party, carry forward the glorious tradition, be self-reliant, and strive hard. They will make full use of all favorable conditions to contribute to the construction of a more prosperous and thriving socialist new countryside and to the realization of the Party's great strategic goals.

    亿万农民沿着有中国特色社会主义道路前进
    ——纪念中华人民共和国成立四十周年
    《农民日报》编辑部
    40年前，新中国成立前夕，美国国务卿艾奇逊在写给美国总统杜鲁门的信中说：“人民的吃饭问题，是每个中国政府必然碰到的第一个问题。一直到现在没有一个政府使这个问题得到解决。”他认为中国共产党解决不了吃饭问题，只有靠美国的面粉过日子。40年过去了。事实使这位国务卿的预言破产了。我们在占世界耕地面积7％的土地上，创造了养活占世界总人口22％的奇迹。在中国共产党领导下，中国人民世世代代为之奋斗的温饱问题已经基本解决，亿万农民正在沿着具有中国特色的社会主义道路胜利前进！
    巨大的成就
    40年，在人类历史长河中只是一瞬间，中国农村却发生了翻天覆地的大变化。
    1988年主要农产品产量比建国前最高年产量成倍增长。其中，粮食为2.6倍，棉花为4.9倍，糖料为10.3倍，水产品为7.1倍。粮食、棉花、肉类总产量均跃居世界首位。40年来，尽管全国人口由5.4亿增加到11亿，耕地由人均2.7亩减少到1.4亩，而人均占有主要农副产品的数量却大大增多了。粮食由209公斤增至355公斤，棉花由0.8公斤增至3.7公斤，油料由4.7公斤增至12公斤。猪牛羊肉类由3.6公斤增至19.8公斤。
    农业生产条件有了显著改善，昔日以使用人力、畜力、手工工具为特征的传统农业，正在向现代农业转化。全国现已建成水库8万多座，万亩以上大中型灌区5300多处，农田有效灌溉面积达到6.6亿多亩。农机从无到有，农业科技不断进步。因袭几千年的单一的农村产业结构逐步被打破。在种植业发展的同时，一向短腿的林牧副渔业也加快了步伐，在农业总产值中的比重由1949年的17％上升到1988年的44.1％。乡镇企业的崛起尤其引人注目，不仅吸收农村大批剩余劳动力就业，为农业提供了上百亿元建设资金，而且在出口创汇方面发挥了重要作用。
    在生产发展基础上，亿万农民的生活不断提高。1988年，农村人均纯收入545元，扣除物价上涨因素，比1978年增长2.1倍，平均每年增长11.8％。近10年来，农村累计新建住房67亿平方米，每百户农民就有75户住进新房，人均住房面积由8.1平方米增加到16.6平方米。
    曲折的道路
    成就是光辉的，道路又是曲折的。
    在领导几亿农民走上具有中国特色的社会主义道路的进程中，我们有过成功的喜悦，也有失误的痛苦，而真正在“中国特色”上取得比较完整的认识，则是在党的十一届三中全会以后。
    新中国建立以后，从1950年到1952年，党领导农民在全国范围内进行大规模的土地改革，彻底废除了统治中国3000年之久的封建土地制度，使3亿多农民分得约7亿亩耕地和大批生产资料，极大地提高了农民的劳动热情，农业生产迅速得到了恢复和发展。1952年，农业总产值达到461亿元，比1949年增长48.4％，主要农产品产量都超过解放前最高历史水平。
    土地改革后的农村，占绝对优势的仍然是分散、落后的小农经济，这种状况同进一步发展生产，同农民自身摆脱贫困，同国家工业化都存在很大的矛盾，为此党通过互助组、初级社、高级社等形式一步一步地引导农民组织起来，走共同富裕的道路。尽管从初级社到高级社的步子快了一些，这一期间农业生产仍然继续发展。
    1958年，高级合作社刚刚组建两年，尚未巩固，人民公社运动就在全国推开。由于以“一大二公”为特征的人民公社违背了生产关系要适应生产力的原理，超出了农民群众的觉悟水平，由于高指标、瞎指挥、浮夸风和“共产风”等“左”的错误，再加上自然灾害，农业生产遭受到严重挫折。1960年粮食产量降到1951年的水平，党中央及时觉察到经济工作中的失误，对人民公社体制和其他农村政策及时进行了调整，使广大农村重现生机。
    “文化大革命”的10年动乱，又一次使中国农业受挫。在以阶级斗争为纲的“左”的思想干扰下，广大农民的生产积极性低落，农村经济基本陷于停滞。1978年，全国人均粮食大体上还只相当于1957年的水平，有近1／4生产队社员收入在50元以下，平均每个生产大队的集体积累不到1万元，有的地方甚至不能维持简单再生产。
    党的十一届三中全会成为一个伟大的历史转折点。这次会议遵循马克思主义的思想路线，总结前30年正反两方面的经验教训，肯定成绩，指出失误，提出解决措施，专门制定了《关于加快农业发展若干问题的决议（草案）》。自那时以来，农村在拨乱反正的基础上进行了并继续进行着一场深刻的改革。与前30年相比，10年改革的最大成果是：不断完善社会主义，走上一条具有中国特色的社会主义道路，使社会主义优越性开始得到较充分发挥。
    第一，在坚持社会主义公有制经济为主体的前提下，允许包括个体经济、私营经济在内的多种经济成份存在和发展。对个体经济、私营经济，运用经济的、行政的、法律的手段，既发挥其积极作用又限制其消极作用。
    第二，在社会主义合作经济中，经营形式多种多样，广泛实行联产承包责任制。这种责任制把土地所有权和使用权分开处理，将家庭经营引入合作经济，形成一种生产者和经营者相统一、责权利相统一、统和分相结合的双层经营结构，使集体优越性和家庭积极性都得到发挥。与此同时，在有条件的地区，根据农民自愿原则，稳妥地推广适度规模经营。
    第三，农村产业结构由单一变成三个层次组成：种植业；包括林牧渔在内的大农业；包括乡镇企业、商业、运输业、建筑业、服务业在内的非农产业。8亿农民搞饭吃的局面开始改变。
    第四，把计划经济和市场调节结合起来。在坚持国家计划的前提下，运用市场、价格、契约等经济、行政和法律手段来改善政府对农村经济的调控。
    第五，在发扬我国传统农业优点的基础上，努力运用现代科学技术成果。
    第六，坚持四项基本原则，把物质文明建设和精神文明建设结合起来。在搞好物质文明建设的同时，注意用马克思主义的理想、信念、道德教育农民，培养一代有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义新农民。
    党的十一届三中全会以后我国农业所走的这条道路，用生产力标准来检验是正确的。从1978年到1988年，我国农村经济取得了突破性的进展。农业总产值平均每年增长6.2％，超过前26年年增长2.7％的速度一倍多。
    宝贵的经验
    党的十一届三中全会制定的加快农业发展的决定，是总结我们党领导农业经验十分重要的文件。其中有这样两段话：
    “摆在我们面前的首要任务，就是要集中精力使目前还很落后的农业尽快得到迅速发展，因为农业是国民经济的基础，农业的高速度发展是保证实现四个现代化的根本条件”。
    “确定农业政策和农村经济政策的首要出发点是充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性，充分调动我国八亿农民的积极性”。
    这两段话的实质，可以理解为要正确地对待农业，要正确地对待农民。这“两个正确对待”是我们党领导农业经验特别重要的内容，现在和将来都具有指导意义。
    1982年5月，邓小平同志在向利比亚国家元首介绍我国经济建设的经验时，用通俗形象语言精辟地讲了重视发展农业的重要意义。他说：“不管天下发生什么事，只要人民吃饱肚子，一切就好办了。”
    历史有力地证明了这一点。40年来，什么时候农业生产发展，全国的日子就比较好过，什么时候农业生产停滞或下降，全国的日子就不好过。1978年底，十年内乱结束不久，国民经济濒临崩溃的危险境地，中央就是抓住振兴农业这一环把整个国民经济带动起来的。
    在贯彻农业是国民经济基础的思想中，必须正确地处理工农两大产业的关系。我们有些同志并非不知道，也不是不赞成农业是国民经济的基础，但是出于早日实现工业化的良好愿望，在具体工作中往往不自觉地重工轻农。在新形势下必须进一步明确：发达的工业必须以发达的农业为基础，决不能认为工业有了发展，农业就不是基础了。不久前国务院公布的产业政策，再次明确农业是国家优先投资的重点产业。这些重大的方针政策，我们要认真贯彻落实。
    与正确地对待农业相联系，还必须正确地对待农民。八亿农民是发展农业的主体，是安定团结的基本因素。可以这样说：农民不稳，天下不稳；农民不富，中国不富。
    40年正反两方面的经验告诉我们，要正确地对待农民，一方面要对农民进行社会主义教育，引导他们走社会主义道路，正确处理国家、集体和个人的关系；另一方面要在经济上充分关心他们的物质利益，在政治上切实保障他们的民主权利。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，由安徽省凤阳县只有十几户人家的小岗生产队点燃的大包干星星之火，竟以不可阻挡之势在全国燎原，一个根本原因，就是大包干在坚持社会主义的前提下，照顾和尊重农民的物质利益和民主权利。大包干有三句话：“交够国家的，留足集体的，剩下是自己的。”这三句话不仅表明国家、集体和个人的关系的正确处理，而且满足了农民对生产和分配自主权的要求。这就使农民从切身利益上把农业变成了自己的事业，产生了一种发展生产的内在动力。
    我们党从成立的一天起，就同农民有着血肉的联系，农民历来是工人阶级的天然同盟军。民主革命依靠农民的支持取得了胜利；社会主义现代化建设，改革开放，也离不开农民的支持。因此，我们必须重视农民的利益，注意改善同农民的关系，进一步加强工业对农业的支援，加强城市对农村的支援，从政治、经济、科学、教育、文化等方面不断采取切实措施，巩固工农联盟。
    我们共产党人从来是两点论。当庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年的时候，我们一方面要看到我国农业战线取得的光辉成就，另一方面也不忽视前进道路上存在的困难和问题。
    从目前来看，我国农业生产力还比较低，整个农村的物质文化和科学技术基础还比较薄弱；社会主义制度下的商品经济还处于起步阶段，对如何搞好计划经济与市场调节相结合还缺乏经验；由于条件不同，各地区发展很不平衡，一些边远山区尚有几千万农民温饱问题没有解决；特别是近几年来，粮食、棉花等主要农产品出现的徘徊局面尚未扭转。
    从长远来看，我国人均占有资源量不多，随着人口增加、工业发展和城乡居民消费水平的提高，这种资源短缺矛盾会更加尖锐，在科学技术没有取得重大突破之前，还难以从根本上得到解决。
    但是，困难和问题难不倒我们，正视困难是为了继续前进，我们没有任何理由悲观失望。当前，许多克服困难的有利因素和条件摆在我们的面前：40年来，我们已经制定了一套比较完整的发展农村经济的方针和政策；创造和积累了许多发展农业生产的宝贵经验；建立了一个强大的完整的工业体系；农业内部，包括农田水利建设在内的物质条件也比过去大大加强；我国农业生产水平还很低，因而农业科学技术增产的潜力很大。我们相信，在民主革命时期和过去40年社会主义建设中立下不朽功勋的几亿农民，一定能在党的领导下，发扬光荣传统，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，把一切有利条件充分利用起来，为建设更加繁荣兴旺的社会主义新农村，为实现党的伟大战略目标作出自己的贡献。
