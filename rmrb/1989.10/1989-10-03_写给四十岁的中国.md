You nourish me with the fruits of your forty years
I was born in your cradle
I crawl on your fertile land
The endless mountains are your sturdy bones
The surging rivers are your pulsating veins
You are lush like the green of July
You are handsome like the flowers of spring
You are changing your appearance
You are changing your attire
Your frail body is no longer thin
Your shameful past is washed clean
History’s eyes will re-examine your standing
Every time the national flag is raised
It strikes a chord in the hearts of the descendants of Yan and Huang
Another forty-year-old youthful temptation
Grows in the national anthem composed by heroes
We are not afraid of being young—
Youth is bound to be full of vigor
We are not afraid of being tender—
Tenderness is bound to grow into maturity
You are a lush tree
The storms will not bend your waist
Plots will be defeated
Worms will be eliminated
I shout, “Mother!”
Children will dance and sing for you.

    写给四十岁的中国
    南村
    你用四十岁的果食喂养我
    我诞生于你的襁褓
    我匍匐在你肥沃的土地
    连绵的群山是你挺拔的骨骼
    奔腾的江河是你鼓动的脉搏
    你葱笼如绿色的七月
    你俊俏如春天的花朵
    你在更换着容貌
    你在交替着穿着
    你贫弱的身躯已不再单薄
    你耻辱的往昔已洗清污浊
    历史的眼睛将重审你屹立的位
      置
    每一次国旗的升起
    都把炎黄子孙的心弦弹拨
    又一个四十岁年青的诱惑
    在勇士谱就的国歌里成长
    我们不怕年幼——
    年青必然精力充足
    我们不怕稚嫩——
    稚嫩必然走向成熟
    你是一株葱茏的大树
    动荡的摇撼不会弯折你的腰肢
    有阴谋必被击败
    有蛀虫必将清除
    我喊一声母亲
    儿女要为你载舞高歌
