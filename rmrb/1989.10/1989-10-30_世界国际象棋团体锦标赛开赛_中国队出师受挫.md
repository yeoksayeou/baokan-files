The second World Chess Team Championship began today in Lucerne, Switzerland. China's team, in their first match against the Hungarian team, who were runners-up in the previous championship, faced an early setback.

The World Chess Team Championship is the highest level of competition in the international chess world. The tournament is held every four years. The 10 countries participating in this year's championship include the champions from Asia, the Americas, Europe, and Africa, the top five teams from the Olympic team competition, and the host country, Switzerland.

China, which finished seventh in the previous championship, faced a strong Hungarian team today. The Chinese team included four international masters: Ye Jiangchuan, Xu Jun, Ye Rongguang, and Wang Zili. The match started at 3 PM and lasted several hours. In the end, China lost 1-3 to the powerful Hungarian team. Ye Jiangchuan and Xu Jun each drew their games against two Hungarian grandmasters. Ye Rongguang, who initially had the advantage with more pieces, eventually lost due to his eagerness to win, turning a material advantage into a losing position with a knight and bishop endgame. Another Chinese player, Wang Zili, also lost his match. According to the draw, China will face the American champion team from Cuba tomorrow.

　　世界国际象棋团体锦标赛开赛
　　中国队出师受挫
    据新华社卢塞恩10月28日电　（记者施光耀）第二届世界国际象棋团体锦标赛今天在瑞士卢塞恩拉开战幕。中国队首战上届世界亚军匈牙利队，出师受挫。
    世界国际象棋团体锦标赛是当今世界国际象棋棋坛最高水平的比赛。比赛每4年举行一次。参加本届比赛的10个国家分别是亚洲、美洲、欧洲和非洲四大洲的冠军、奥林匹克团体赛的前五名，以及东道国瑞士。
    上届比赛第七名中国队今天迎战世界劲旅匈牙利队，出场的是叶江川、徐俊、叶荣光、汪自力4位国际大师。比赛从下午3点钟开始，经过数小时的激战，结果中国队以1∶3负于实力雄厚的匈牙利队。其中，叶江川与徐俊分别战和对方的两名特级大师。叶荣光虽一度以多兵的优势扼制住对手，但由于求胜心切，结果从多兵变成弃兵、丢兵，形成马象残局，后来失招败北。另一位中国选手汪自力也负给了对手。根据抽签，中国队明天将与美洲冠军古巴队交锋。
