The Xinanjiang Hydropower Station is the first hydropower station built by China through self-reliance. It has an installed capacity of 660,000 kilowatts. It plays a crucial role in frequency regulation and peak shaving within the East China Power Grid. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the station's construction, during which it has generated 42.9 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, making significant contributions to socialist construction.
