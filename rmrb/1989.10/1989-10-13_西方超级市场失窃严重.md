Supermarkets in the West have become increasingly popular, allowing customers to select items within the store and pay at the exit. While this method is convenient for shoppers, it has also provided opportunities for thieves. Currently, the problem of theft in supermarkets is becoming increasingly severe.

Reports indicate that in the UK, the value of stolen goods from stores each year is approximately 1.5 billion pounds, accounting for 1% of sales, and this figure is increasing by 15% annually. In the US, the value of stolen goods from stores exceeds $8 billion each year. In Belgium, the value of stolen goods from stores exceeds 380 million Belgian francs annually.

Supermarkets have implemented strict anti-theft measures, such as installing rotating surveillance cameras, equipping many items with small electronic components, and having plainclothes detectives blend in with customers to monitor activities. Security personnel are also stationed at entrances and exits. Despite these measures, items like perfumes, cosmetics, and mini tape recorders are still difficult to protect, and thieves are becoming increasingly sophisticated. In California, women spend $300 to purchase a "big belly" made of fiberglass from a specialized store, which they wear around their waist to look pregnant. The "big belly" can hold a large amount of stolen goods. In Denver, a thief dressed as a surveyor carried a 6-foot-long tube containing pliers. He pointed the tube at a jacket on a counter, and a nearby detective was amazed to see the jacket disappear into the tube.

Theft of goods has caused many retailers to feel anxious. As a result, new anti-theft strategies are continually being developed. In some large shopping malls in Toronto, Canada, there are lively performances of "catching thieves" to warn potential shoplifters. One store has placed a wooden board at the entrance and exit with a drawing of a menacing police officer to psychologically deter thieves.

    西方超级市场失窃严重
    袁安琴
    西方盛行的超级市场，让顾客在商店内自选商品，在出口处统一付钱。这种方式方便了顾客，但也让窃贼钻了空子，目前超级市场的失窃问题正在日趋严重。
    据报道，英国每年商店的失窃物品价值约为15亿英磅，占销售额的1％，而且每年正以15％的速度递增；美国每年商店的失窃商品价值在80多亿美元以上；比利时每年商店的被盗商品价值超过3800万比利时法郎。
    超级市场内有非常严密的防窃措施，如安装有旋转式摄象监视机，许多服装上装有小电子元件，在大商场不少便衣侦探混在顾客中暗中监视，出入口都有保安人员。尽管如此，可像香水、化妆品、微型录放机等物品的失窃防不胜防，而且偷窃技术也越来越高明。在美国的加利福尼亚州，妇女花上300美元在专门商店里买一只用玻璃纤维制成的“大肚子”，将它系在腰上，看上去像个孕妇，“大肚子”内能装很多偷窃的东西。在丹佛，有一个偷窃者穿得象土地测量员，手里拿了一根6英尺长的管子，里面藏着钳子，将管子的一头对准柜台上的一件夹克衫，站在一旁的侦探惊奇地看着夹克衫消失在圆管中。
    物品失窃使许多零售商焦虑不安。于是也不断出现治偷新招。在加拿大多伦多市的一些大商场中，演出活灵活现的抓“小偷”闹剧，以警告那些想偷窃者；有一家商场在进出口处立上一块木板，上面画着凶神恶煞似的警察，给偷窃者以心理威慑。
