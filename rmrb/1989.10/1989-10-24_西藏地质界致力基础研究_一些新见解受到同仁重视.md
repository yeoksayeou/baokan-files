Geologists in Tibet Dedicated to Basic Research
Some New Insights Gain Attention from Peers

Lhasa, October 23 (Reported by Lu Xiaofei) — Geologists in Tibet presented some fresh insights on local geological structures at the recently concluded Second Tibet Geological Society Conference.

Summer Bin, a 34-year-old doctoral student, believes that based on features such as sedimentary processes, fossil groups, paleomagnetism, metamorphism, and magmatic activity, Tibet can be divided into several distinct tectonic units. The separation, drift, and collision of these different tectonic units reveal the plate tectonic processes and crustal evolution characteristics of the Gondwana and Eurasian continents.

Senior engineer Zhou Xiang systematically applied plate tectonics to continental structures, revealing the evolution of the ancient Tethys Ocean and the formation history of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and explaining the geological structural features of Tibet. The first provincial plate tectonic geological map of China, edited by him, has been well received by geologists both domestically and internationally.

Most members of the Tibet Geological Society come from field geological work teams. The 58 papers submitted to the conference reflect the Tibetan geological community's emphasis on basic geological work, geological research, and the integration of mineral exploration.

　　西藏地质界致力基础研究
　　一些新见解受到同仁重视
    本报拉萨10月23日电　记者卢小飞报道：西藏地质学家在日前结束的第二届西藏地质学会上，就本地地质构造提出了一些新鲜的见解。
    34岁的博士研究生夏斌认为，根据沉积作用、古生物化石群、古地磁、变质作用及岩浆活动等特征，可将西藏化分出若干个不同的地体。这些不同地体的裂离、漂移、拼贴割据，揭示了冈瓦纳古陆与欧亚古陆的板块运动过程及地壳演化特点。
    高级工程师周祥将板块构造观点系统地运用在大陆构造上，揭示了古特提斯洋的演化过程和青藏高原形成历史，阐明了西藏地质构造特征。由他主编的国内第一张分省区板块构造地质图，获得了国内外地质学家的好评。
    西藏地质学会会员大都来自野外地质工作队，向会议提交的58篇论文，反映出西藏地质学界重视基础地质工作、地质科研和找矿相结合的特点。
