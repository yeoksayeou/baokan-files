Planting "dragon seeds" but harvesting "fleas" seems inconceivable, but in social life, such phenomena do indeed exist. Reflecting on the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the patriotic fervor of young students was exploited by counter-revolutionary plotters; some who boasted of being "elites," such as graduate students and doctoral candidates, became leaders of illegal organizations. This should give us pause for thought. As Beijing Automobile Industry Corporation General Manager Zheng Huánmíng said: "If things continue this way, at best we are making the bed for others, and at worst we are creating our own gravediggers!"

Born in the People's Republic, raised under the Five-Star Red Flag, from the first words of a child to university, how much hope and expectation have been placed in them by the Party and the people. Regrettably, in recent years, under the erroneous guidance of the "transformation theory," ideological and political work and the all-around development of moral, intellectual, and physical education have been drowned out by the gray "theories of freedom and human rights," leading to a serious tendency to emphasize intellectual education while neglecting moral education. Some high achievers and academic stars have been led astray by the bourgeois liberalization trend. From "valuing talent over virtue" to the tragedy of "disturbance elites," this is indeed something that educators could not have foreseen.

"Oranges planted south of the Huai River become oranges, but north of the Huai River they become bitter oranges." Environmental factors can destroy the stability of genetic inheritance. Not long ago, some ideological, cultural, and public opinion fronts were shrouded in gloom, with right and wrong reversed. Capitalist clichés were hailed as "new ideas," the Chinese nation was vilified, and Western civilization was seen as "heaven." Some places even held "salons" advocating "multi-party politics" and "elite politics," fearing nothing more than a stable world. All these factors combined, like whirlwinds and acid rain, severely polluted the spiritual world, creating the soil and opportunity for the "dragon seed" to degenerate into "fleas." This shows that the younger generation is not living in a sterile vacuum; they face the danger of "peaceful evolution" and how much they need ample sunlight and high-quality nourishment.

The Russian fabulist Krylov once said: "A fool boasts of his shortcomings, which are the very things that make him the object of ridicule and contempt, and often he boasts of what should be a source of great shame." The so-called "high-level leaders" of the "High-level Federation" who dreamed of making a name for themselves became the echo of reactionary forces. Their tragedy lies in the influence of the bourgeois worldview and outlook on life. May the younger generation take this as a lesson, overcome their immaturity, get rid of their "superman complex," study hard, change their thinking, and truly grasp the compass and rudder of life. Only then can they sail across the ocean without losing their way and ride the waves without capsizing.

After the pain comes reflection, and after the loss comes repair. The Party and the people always have high hopes for the youth. Stalin once compared talent to "the most precious and decisive capital of all the precious things in the world." The talent we are talking about is the red and expert, morally and intellectually outstanding young people, not the "crooked talent," "foolish talent," and "disturbance talent." An ancient saying goes: "Talent is the resource of virtue; virtue is the commander of talent." Comrade Chen Yi also gave an analogy: If a pilot only emphasizes good technology and does not pay attention to being politically red, he will fly the plane to the enemy's side. This warning is worth pondering.

"No great historical disaster is without historical progress to compensate for it." Although the pain of the disturbance still needs to be healed and the danger of "peaceful evolution" still exists, we firmly believe that as long as we adhere to the four cardinal principles, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor have hope, and the Chinese nation has a future. Today, we plant "dragon seeds" and eliminate "fleas"; tomorrow, we will surely welcome the soaring of the socialist dragon!

    “龙种”与“跳蚤”
    李林
    播下“龙种”，却收获“跳蚤”，这似乎是不可思议的，但在社会生活中，确实又有这种现象。反思北京发生的反革命暴乱，青年学生的爱国热情被反革命阴谋家所利用；一些自诩为“精英”的研究生、博士生成了非法组织的头目，这还不能发人深省吗？正如北京汽车工业公司总经理郑焕明同志所说：“如果照这样下去，弄得好些也是为他人作了嫁衣裳，弄得不好是在为我们自己造就掘墓人！”
    生于人民共和国，长在五星红旗下，从牙牙学语到上大学，寄托着党和人民的多少热望和期待。遗憾的是，近年来在“改造论”的错误指导下，思想政治工作、德智体全面发展，被灰色的“自由、人权论”所淹没，出现了强调智育、忽视德育的严重倾向。一些高材生、学习尖子被导向资产阶级自由化思潮的歧途。如此从“重才轻德”到“动乱精英”的悲剧，的确是教育工作者们始料不及的。
    “橘生淮南则为橘，生于淮北则为枳”，环境因素能够破坏基因遗传的稳定性。曾几何时，一些思想、文化和舆论阵地阴霾密布，黑白颠倒，资本主义的陈词滥调被奉为“新思想”，中华民族被丑化，西方文明成“天堂”。有些地方竟出现了鼓嗓“多元政体”、“精英政治”的“沙龙”，唯恐天下不乱。以上种种因素聚合起来，阵阵“旋风”、“酸雨”，严重污染了精神世界，酿成了“龙种”蜕变、“跳蚤”衍生的土壤和契机。这说明，青年一代不是生活在无菌真空，他们面临着“和平演变”的危险，他们是多么需要充足的光照和优质的食粮啊。
    俄国寓言家克雷洛夫有句名言：“蠢才妄自尊大：他自鸣得意的，正好是受人讥笑奚落的短处，而且往往把应该引为奇耻大辱的事，大吹大擂。”幻想一鸣惊人的所谓“高自联”“领袖”，之所以成为反动势力的应声虫，其悲剧就在于资产阶级的人生观、世界观作祟。但愿青年一代都能以此为戒，克服幼稚病，摆脱“超人感”，读书学习，改造思想，真正把握人生的坐标和风帆。这样才能飘洋过海不迷航，伏波冲浪不覆舟。
    痛定思痛，亡羊补牢，党和人民始终对青年们寄予殷切的希望。斯大林曾把人才喻为“世界上所有宝贵的资本中最宝贵最有决定意义的资本”。我们所说的人才，是又红又专、德才兼备的有志之士，而决不是“歪才”、“蠢才”及“动乱之才”。古语说得好：“才者，德之资也；德者，才之帅也。”陈毅同志还打过一个比方：飞行员如果光强调技术好，不重视思想红，他就会把飞机开到敌人那边去。这个告诫值得深思。
    “没有一种巨大历史的灾难是没有历史的进步来作补偿的。”虽然动乱的创痛还需疗治，“和平演变”的危险依然存在，但我们坚信，只要坚持四项基本原则这个立国之本，炎黄子孙就有希望，中华民族就有前途。今天，我们播下“龙种”，清除“跳蚤”；明天，必将迎来社会主义的巨龙腾飞！
