    The State Administration of Cultural Heritage is currently conducting a thorough investigation into the recent large-scale destruction of the Ming Dynasty Great Wall in parts of Inner Mongolia and Shanxi provinces.

    According to reports, the severe incident primarily occurred in Qinghuhe County, Inner Mongolia, and Panguangan County, Shanxi. An urgent report from Qinghuhe County stated that three townships within its jurisdiction have demolished four beacon towers of the Great Wall, and 30 kilometers of the wall have been completely dismantled, leaving only earthen walls.

    Experts explain that the Ming Dynasty Great Wall in Qinghuhe and Panguangan counties spans 150 kilometers, with the outer layers constructed entirely of bricks and stones, making it extremely sturdy and comparable to the Great Wall sections in Beijing's Badaling, Mutianyu, and Hebei's Shanhaiguan.

    Upon receiving an urgent report from the Cultural Affairs Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on July 14, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage immediately notified local authorities to halt the destruction and dispatched personnel for on-site investigations. Members of the investigation team, including National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference member and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Great Wall Society Luo Zhewen, and National Committee member and member of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage Zheng Xiaoxie, described to the reporter the dire condition of the damaged Great Wall.

    "The investigation team witnessed firsthand piles of bricks and stones removed from the Great Wall and beacon towers. Some were stacked together awaiting transport, while others were scattered on the roads... These bricks and stones are reportedly to be transported and distributed after the autumn harvest."

    "Even the fortresses that are part of the Great Wall system were not spared. Shanxi Province's Panguangan County has over 20 large and small fortresses near the Great Wall, each one destroyed. The Great Wall is like a body stripped of its clothing, leaving only the earthen core. Some even dug holes in the earthen walls to store items or live in, and others dug out the earth to make bricks. The Great Wall is truly in a pitiful state!"

    "However, in some local villages, houses, pigpens, sheep pens, and even toilets are all built with bricks from the Great Wall. In front of and behind some houses, there are large quantities of neatly stacked Great Wall stones, presumably for future construction. One farmer transported 60 loads of bricks and stones from the dismantled wall to his home."

    "We only inspected part of the area, but what we saw was shocking."

    Upon arriving in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the local government immediately organized departments including the Cultural Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Courts to conduct on-site investigations of over 10 damaged sections. Currently, the destruction of the Great Wall has been halted.

    清水河偏关长城遗址遭破坏  文物部门派员前往调查制止
    本报讯　记者齐欣报道：国家文物局目前正在认真调查内蒙古与山西以长城分界的部分地区近期发生的大规模拆毁明代长城的恶性事件。
    据了解，这起严重事件主要发生在内蒙古清水河县和山西偏关县。来自清水河县的紧急报告中称，其境内3个乡已拆毁长城烽火台4座，有30公里长的长城墙全部被拆，仅存土墙。
    据专家介绍，清水河和偏关县境内的明代长城共150公里，外部全部用砖石砌就，非常坚固，较之北京八达岭、慕田峪长城及河北山海关长城等毫不逊色。
    国家文物局于7月14日接到内蒙古自治区文化厅的紧急报告后，立即通知当地主管部门制止破坏，并派员实地调查。参加调查组的全国政协委员、中国长城协会副会长罗哲文和全国政协委员、国家文物委员会委员郑孝燮向记者叙述了当地长城受破坏的惨状。
    “调查组在现场亲眼看到，一大堆一大堆从长城和烽火台上拆下的砖石，有的堆放在一起待运，有的还撒落在大路上……这些砖石据说是留待秋天农收后再运走私分的。”
  “属于长城体系的堡城也难逃厄运。山西省偏关县有大大小小20多座位于长城附近的堡城，可怜每座都遭到破坏。长城就像被扒光了衣服一样，只剩下了土城心，甚至还有人在土墙上打洞以存物住人或挖土烧砖，长城真惨呢！”
    “然而，在当地一些村子里，住房、猪圈羊圈甚至厕所都清一色是用长城砖盖起来的。在一些房前屋后，还大量整齐码放着长城条石，是为以后盖房做准备。”“有一个农民，把拆下的砖石，整整往家运了60车。”
    “我们只查看了一部分，但已经是触目惊心了。”
    调查组到达内蒙古自治区后，当地政府即组织文化厅、公安厅、法院等部门一起前往现场，对10多处被破坏地段逐一调查。目前，拆毁长城行为已被制止。（附图片）
