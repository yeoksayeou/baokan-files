Jiang Zemin and Yang Shangkun Meet with Chatchai

Jiang Zemin: China Does Not Export Revolution and Does Not Allow Other Countries to Interfere in Its Internal Affairs

Yang Shangkun: Sino-Thai Friendly Relations Are a Model of Cooperation Between Countries with Different Systems

	Beijing, October 25th: Reporter Wen Xian reports: This afternoon, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin stated that China adheres to one principle: China does not export revolution, and at the same time, it does not allow other countries to interfere in China's internal affairs and socialist construction. The system a country adopts is decided by its own people. However, relations between countries should adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; economic and trade relations between countries should be established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

	He also expressed that China's reform and opening-up policy will continue and will not change.

	Jiang Zemin made these remarks during a meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan.

	The meeting took place in Zhongnanhai. In a warm and friendly atmosphere, Jiang Zemin first expressed a warm welcome to Chatchai for his second visit to China. He said, "China and Thailand have always had very good friendship. We have no reason not to continue to develop this close and friendly relationship."

	Prime Minister Chatchai thanked the Chinese government for inviting him to visit China again. He said, "The relationship between Thailand and China is very good and satisfactory. The two countries understand each other very well. After the 'June Fourth Incident,' the Thai government publicly announced that it is China's internal affair. The policy of the Thai government has always been not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. The relationship between Thailand and China has continued normally without any changes."

	When discussing the Cambodian issue, Jiang Zemin said, "One is that Vietnam must truly withdraw all its troops from Cambodia. This problem must be resolved before the Cambodian issue can be resolved. The other is to establish a temporary coalition government in Cambodia led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk."

	Chatchai said, "Vietnam has announced that it has withdrawn from Cambodia. Unfortunately, there is no international monitoring mechanism to supervise Vietnam's withdrawal. Only by establishing such an international monitoring mechanism can it be known whether Vietnam has truly withdrawn."

	Beijing, October 25th: Reporter Wen Xian reports: This afternoon, State President Yang Shangkun met with Thai Prime Minister Chatchai at the Great Hall of the People and said that Sino-Thai friendly relations are a model of friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems.

	He said, "Sino-Thai friendship has withstood the test of history. There are no conflicts of interest between our two countries, and we need to complement each other."

	Chatchai expressed that coming to China is like coming to a second hometown. In maintaining close political and economic relations between Thailand and China, Thailand has not changed. The Thai government has announced that the 'June Fourth Incident' does not affect the close and friendly cooperation between Thailand and China in all aspects.

	Yang Shangkun said, "On the Cambodian issue, China and Thailand are consistent in the general direction. What is important now is for Vietnam to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia under international supervision. Vietnam must completely withdraw all its troops from Cambodia. At the same time, a temporary coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk should be established."

	Prime Minister Chatchai also reiterated the Thai government's principled stance on the Cambodian issue.

　　江泽民杨尚昆分别会见差猜
　　江泽民说：中国不输出革命也不允许别国干涉内政
　　杨尚昆说：中泰友好关系是不同制度国家合作典范
    本报北京10月25日讯　记者温宪报道：中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午说，中国坚持一条原则：中国不输出革命，同时也不允许别国干涉中国内政和建设社会主义。一国采取什么样的制度，由该国人民自己决定。但是，国与国之间的关系则应遵循和平共处五项原则；国与国之间的经贸关系应该建立在平等互利的基础上。
    他同时表示，中国的改革、开放政策将继续下去，不会改变。
    江泽民是在会见泰王国总理差猜·春哈旺时阐述以上观点的。
    会见在中南海进行。在亲切、友好的气氛中，江泽民首先对差猜再次访华表示热烈欢迎。他说，中泰两国一直有着非常良好的友谊。我们没有任何理由不把这样亲密、友好的关系继续发展下去。
    差猜总理感谢中国政府邀请他再次访华。他说，泰中关系非常良好，令人满意，两国彼此非常了解。“天安门事件”发生后，泰国政府公开宣布这是中国的内政。泰国政府的政策历来是不干涉别国内政。泰中关系一直在正常进行，没有发生变化。
    在谈到柬埔寨问题时，江泽民说，一个是越南必须真正从柬埔寨全部撤军。这个问题不解决，柬埔寨问题解决不了。另一个是要在柬埔寨建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。
    差猜说，越南宣布已从柬埔寨撤军。但遗憾的是，没有一个国际监督机制来监督越南撤军。只有建立这样的国际监督机制，才能知道越南是否真正撤军。
    本报北京10月25日讯　记者温宪报道：国家主席杨尚昆今天下午在人民大会堂会见泰国总理差猜时说，中泰友好关系是社会制度不同的两个国家友好合作的典范。
    他说，中泰友谊经受住了历史的考验。我们两国之间没有利害冲突，需要互通有无。
    差猜表示，来到中国就好像来到了第二故乡。在泰中两国间保持密切的政治、经济关系方面，泰国没有任何改变。泰国政府已经宣布，“天安门事件”不影响泰中之间各方面的密切、友好合作关系。
    杨尚昆说，在柬埔寨问题上，中泰两国在总的方向上是一致的。现在重要的是在国际监督下，越南自柬埔寨全部撤军。越南必须干干净净地从柬埔寨全部撤军。同时，要建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。
    差猜总理也重申了泰国政府在柬问题上的原则立场。（附图片）
