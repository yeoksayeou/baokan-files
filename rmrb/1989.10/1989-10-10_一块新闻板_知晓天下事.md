Upon entering the central office building of the First Heavy Machinery Plant in Fulaerji, one is greeted by a prominent "Today's News" propaganda board. Every morning before work, more than 10 propaganda cadres from various workshops come here to copy the "News Summary" from the Central People's Broadcasting Station. This practice has been maintained for 31 years.

This "Today's News" propaganda board was established in 1958, the same year as this modern enterprise. For 31 years, workers' first task upon arriving at work is to check today's news. The propaganda board has become a trusted guide for workers to learn about political and current affairs.

    一块新闻板　知晓天下事
    据新华社哈尔滨10月9日电　走进富拉尔基第一重机厂的中心办公大楼，迎面有一块醒目的“今日新闻”宣传板。每天早晨上班前，10多个车间的宣传员来这里抄写中央人民广播电台的“新闻报纸摘要”，到目前已坚持了31年。
    这块“今日新闻”宣传板，是1958年与这座现代化企业同时诞生的。31年来，工人们一上班，第一件事就是来看今日新闻，宣传板成为职工学习政治时事的良师益友。
