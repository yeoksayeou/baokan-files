During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the War of Liberation, and after the founding of New China, she not only participated in the Party's leadership of cultural work but also wrote a large number of revolutionary cultural works. "Collected Works of Li Bozhao" is a selection of articles, memoirs, diaries, and literary works from her more than two million words of posthumous works, published by the PLA Press.

The discussion was presided over by Xu Xiaozhong, President of the Central Academy of Drama. Speakers included Jin Ziguang, the editor-in-chief of the collection, Lü Ying, President of the PLA Press, veteran Red Army soldier Liu Ying, renowned playwright Cao Yu, Deputy Director of the Central Archives of the Communist Party of China Peng Xianzhi, veteran Red Army soldier General Zhang Zhen, Acting Minister of Culture He Jingzhi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Major General Zhou Keyu, renowned actress Tian Hua, former director of the China Children's Film Studio Yu Lan, renowned writer Liu Binyang, former secretary-general of the China Dramatists Association Li Chao, and Deputy Professor He Bingzhu of the Central Academy of Drama, among others. In their speeches, they discussed how Li Bozhao's unwavering communist beliefs, her boundless loyalty to the Party and the people, and her selfless dedication to serving the people are all worthy of emulation. "Collected Works of Li Bozhao" not only has valuable historical value but is also an excellent teaching material for revolutionary tradition education and for upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization.
