The "anti-pornography" campaign has developed healthily, and the people are applauding. Some severely illegal bookstalls or publishing houses have been shut down, and a large number of pornographic books, magazines, audio, and video tapes have been pulped or demagnetized, which is met with approval. In addition to being happy, we should also pay attention to another aspect, which is our own bookshelves. In recent years, a large number of "pornographic" and "murderous" materials have flooded the market and entered household bookshelves. This needs to be taken seriously.

Cleaning out one's own bookshelves also involves a matter of awareness. Some people think: "Once married and older, it doesn't matter." This is incorrect. Pornographic books, magazines, and audio-visual products not only seriously harm teenagers but are also harmful to everyone. There are many cases where people in their forties and fifties have been harmed by pornographic publications and ended up in prison. Are such cases rare?

"Knowing it's pornographic and not reading it is fine." This is also incorrect. If a fly enters your home, as long as you don't kill it, it has the potential to spread germs at any time. When you are busy with work, you might not pay attention to it. Once you have free time or feel bored, you might flip through it. At that moment, you might be infected, and the germs will take the opportunity to enter your body. Once they enter, there is a possibility of falling ill.

Some people think their level is high and their "immunity" is strong, so keeping some "pornographic books" is fine. However, even if you can truly "immunize" yourself, can all your family members, children, relatives, friends, or neighbors also "immunize" themselves? If "pornographic books" are not completely eliminated, they will inevitably harm others. Moreover, some people specifically search for such materials to circulate or reproduce, and your bookshelf might become a source of infection.

Therefore, one should proactively clean out their own bookshelves to avoid leaving any trouble.

    清清自家的书柜
    刘振起　鲁恺
    “扫黄”活动健康发展，国人拍手称快。一些严重违法的书摊或出版单位被取缔，大量黄色书刊、录音录像带被化浆或消磁，令人叫好。高兴之余，感到还应注意到另一面，这就是自家的书柜。这几年，“黄色”、“凶杀”之类的读物，大量涌入市场，进而进入家庭书柜。这是需要认真对待的。
    清自家书柜也有个认识问题。有人认为：“结婚了、年岁大了，无所谓。”这不对。黄色书刊和音像制品不但对青少年危害甚烈，对任何人都有害无益。一些四五十岁的人因受黄色出版物之害，锒铛入狱，这样的事难道还少吗？
    “知道它黄不看就是了。”这也不对。苍蝇飞到家里，只要不打死，它就随时有传播病菌的可能。一时事多、工作忙，也可能不屑一顾。一旦闲下来，或无聊之际，就可能翻翻。其时，触而受染，毒菌也就会乘隙而入。一旦入身，就有发病的可能。
    还有些人以为自己的水平高，“免疫”能力强，留点“黄书”没关系。殊不知，即使你果能“免疫”，你的家人子女、亲朋好友，或邻里乡亲，也个个都能“免疫”吗？“黄书”扫除不尽，势必还要害人。更何况，有些人还专门搜寻此类读物传看或翻印，你的书柜则可能成为传染源。
    因此，自家书柜应该自动清理，不留后患。
