The "1988 China's Top 500 Industrial Enterprises" analysis results, recently published by the Management World magazine of the State Council Development Research Center and the Industrial Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, show that China's largest industrial enterprises are mainly distributed in the eastern and coastal regions, exhibiting a tiered distribution pattern from east to west.

Among these 500 largest industrial enterprises, 317 are located in 12 provinces and municipalities in the eastern and coastal regions, accounting for 63.4%. Their industrial output value accounts for 66.4% of the total output value of the 500 enterprises, their sales revenue accounts for 66.7%, and their profits and taxes account for 60.1%. In contrast, the western region, consisting of 6 provinces and autonomous regions, has only 25 enterprises, accounting for 5% of the total, with their industrial output value accounting for 4.5%, sales revenue accounting for 4%, and profits and taxes accounting for 3.7%.

Some economic experts believe that this research result indicates that the current regional industrial distribution in China is still quite imbalanced. They suggest that while leveraging the roles of the traditional industrial bases in Liaoning and Shanghai, it is important to fully utilize and develop the energy and resources of the western region. In future economic development, the western region should be a key area for China's socio-economic development by the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, to achieve coordinated development among regions.

　　我最大工业企业东部和沿海居多
    新华社北京10月23日电　国务院发展研究中心《管理世界》杂志社和国家统计局工交司最近公布的“1988年中国500家最大工业企业”分析结果表明，我国最大的工业企业主要分布在东部和沿海地区，呈现出由东向西梯级分布趋势。
    这500家最大的工业企业，东部和沿海12个省市有317家，占63.4％，工业产值占500家总产值的66.4％，销售额占66.7％，利税占60.1％。西部地区6个省、自治区却只有25家，占总数的5％，工业产值占4.5％，销售额占4％，利税占3.7％。
    一些经济专家认为，这一研究成果说明目前我国产业地区分布畸型状况仍较严重。他们建议，在发挥辽宁、上海两个传统工业基地作用的同时，应充分利用和开发西部地区的能源和资源，在未来的经济发展中，把西部地区作为我国本世纪末21世纪初社会经济发展的重点，以实现地区间协调发展。
