Why do whales commit suicide? To solve this mystery, scholars and experts from various countries have made numerous guesses and speculations, but they still cannot find a definitive answer. Recently, researchers from the Institute of Evolutionary Morphology and Animal Ecology in the Soviet Union have proposed a new and interesting hypothesis. They believe that, like other animals, whales are often tormented by parasites. A type of small insect called the whale louse loves to suck whale blood. These insects have hard shells, and after biting through the whale's skin, they can burrow into it, causing the whale to bleed. Moreover, the larvae of the whale louse parasitize the whale's skin. A group of whale lice can easily eat away a large piece of whale skin, causing the whale immense pain. Experts believe that to escape the torment of these parasites, whales desperately seek out water bodies with the lowest possible salinity—such as small bays and river mouths. Because once they reach freshwater, the whale lice will automatically leave the whale. However, in freshwater, these marine giants often end up "stranded" due to the ebb tide. No matter how they struggle, or even with the help of a strong storm, they cannot return to the ocean. Currently, experts are verifying this new hypothesis.

    鲸自杀新解
    鲸为什么会自杀？为解开这个谜，各国学者和专家们曾做过种种猜测和设想，但仍无法找到确切的答案。最近，苏联进化形态和动物生态研究所的学者们又提出一个新的有趣的猜想，他们认为，鲸与其他动物一样，常常受到寄生虫的折磨。一种叫作鲸虱的小虫非常喜欢吸吮鲸的血。它们长有硬硬的外壳，当把鲸皮咬坏后，可以钻到鲸皮中，使其流出鲜血。不仅如此，鲸虱的幼虫就寄生在鲸的皮肤中。一群鲸虱能够不费吹灰之力地吃掉很大一块鲸皮而使鲸痛苦不堪。专家们认为，为摆脱这些寄生虫的折磨，鲸拚命想找到一个尽可能被淡化的水域——小海湾、河口等。因为一旦来到了淡水里，鲸虱就会自动离开鲸。但在淡水中，鲸这样的海中庞然大物，没想到常常由于海水退潮而“搁浅”。它们无论怎样挣扎，亦或有大的风暴相助，都不能再回归大海。目前，专家们正在对这一新的猜想进行考证。
