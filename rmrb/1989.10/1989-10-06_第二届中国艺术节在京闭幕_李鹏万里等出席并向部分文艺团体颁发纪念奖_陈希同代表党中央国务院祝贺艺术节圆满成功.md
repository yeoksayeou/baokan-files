The second Chinese Art Festival came to a close tonight in Beijing. The 21-day event, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, featured a diverse array of performances that attracted a million spectators, providing them with aesthetic enjoyment and new insights.

Li Peng, Wan Li, Li Tieying, Ding Guangen, Liu Lantao, Yang Dezhi, Xi Zhongxun, Song Jian, Chen Xitong, Wang Guangying, Deng Zhaoxiang, and Wang Enmao attended the closing ceremony held at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium. They presented commemorative awards to several artistic groups.

Chen Xitong, vice-chairman of the festival, spoke at the closing ceremony. He, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, warmly congratulated the successful conclusion of this festival. He said, "We are confident that the Chinese Art Festival will continue to improve."

This festival featured nearly 200 performances across various artistic genres, many of which were highly acclaimed. The Peking Opera "Four Generals Visiting Their Mother" and the Peking Opera excerpts performed by actors from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai showcased a gathering of renowned stars, with each performer demonstrating exceptional skills, earning praise from both old and new opera enthusiasts, and highlighting the enduring charm of this traditional art form. Winners of the International Ballet Competition, the New Seed Cup Acrobatics Competition, and new talents from art academies gathered, showcasing the growth of a new generation of Chinese artists. Ten amateur performances, each with its unique characteristics, presented a vibrant scene, illustrating the progress made in China's mass cultural endeavors over the past decade of reform and opening up. Performances by artists from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Italy, and other countries allowed Chinese audiences to appreciate high-level foreign art and learn from their counterparts. Overall, while the festival featured many excellent performances, some experts noted that the Chinese stage still lacks masterpieces with grand themes and flawless performances.

The shortcomings serve as a driving force for new thinking and exploration, promoting the prosperity and development of art. It is widely agreed within the festival that art can only prosper and develop by adhering to the direction of serving the people and socialism, and by upholding the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy.

    第二届中国艺术节在京闭幕
    李鹏万里等出席并向部分文艺团体颁发纪念奖
　  陈希同代表党中央国务院祝贺艺术节圆满成功
    本报北京10月5日讯　记者袁晞报道：第二届中国艺术节今晚在北京落下帷幕。历时21天的演出正逢共和国40华诞的喜庆日子，多姿多彩的舞台吸引了百万观众，带给人们美的享受，留给人们新的思索。
    李鹏、万里、李铁映、丁关根、刘澜涛、杨得志、习仲勋、宋健、陈希同、王光英、邓兆祥、王恩茂等同志参加了今晚在北京工人体育馆举行的闭幕式，并向部分文艺团体颁发了艺术节纪念奖。
    本届艺术节副主席陈希同在闭幕式上讲了话，他代表党中央、国务院热烈祝贺这届艺术节圆满成功。他说，我们深信中国艺术节一定会越办越好。
    这届艺术节各艺术门类的演出近200场，其中有不少为人称道的好节目。京剧《四郎探母》和京津沪演员合演的京剧折子戏名角荟萃，各路高手演技精湛，赢得新老戏迷的好评，显示了这一传统艺术的持久魅力。国际芭蕾舞比赛获奖者、新苗杯杂技比赛获奖者和艺术院校的演出新秀云集，青少年演员身手不凡，展示了我国一代艺术新人的成长。10台业余文艺演出各具特色、异彩纷呈，让人们看到，改革开放的10年间，我国群众文化事业同祖国各业同步前进的喜人局面。苏联、朝鲜、意大利等国艺术家的表演让中国观众欣赏了国外高水平的艺术，使中国同行学到不少东西。纵观艺术节的演出，一些行家认为，艺术节虽有不少好节目，但我们的文艺舞台上还缺少主题壮阔恢宏、表演炉火纯青的传世之作。
    不足正是新思考、新探索的动因，促进艺术的繁荣与发展正是艺术节的目的。而只有坚持文艺为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向；坚持“双百”方针艺术才能繁荣与发展，这是艺术节中许多人的共识。
