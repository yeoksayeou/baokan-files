The fine tradition of hard work and self-reliance is one that our Party has cultivated and developed over the course of its long revolutionary struggle. Over the past several decades, our Party has upheld the spirit of hard work and self-reliance, uniting the people of all ethnic groups across the country. In different historical periods, we have withstood various pressures and overcome countless difficulties, achieving one victory after another. The spirit of hard work and self-reliance is an important component of our Party's ideological construction and is also a crucial part of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. In recent years, due to the erroneous influence of the Party's central leadership, the emphasis on hard work and self-reliance has diminished, and the spirit of hard work and self-reliance has gradually faded. This is a serious mistake in our ideological and political work and in the construction of spiritual civilization, and it deserves our serious attention.

During the war years, the environment for struggle was extremely harsh and brutal. Whether in liberated areas or in enemy-occupied territories, whether on the front lines or in the underground struggle behind enemy lines, without a lofty ideal and a firm political stance, without persevering hard work and fearless struggle, we would not have been able to stand our ground and would have faced the danger of annihilation. Hard work and self-reliance became an indispensable condition for the survival and development of revolutionary forces. The spirit of the Jinggang Mountains, the Long March, and Yan'an all included hard work and self-reliance as an important component.

After we seized power and entered the period of peaceful construction, conditions changed fundamentally. Do we still need hard work and self-reliance? The answer is yes. As a socialist country led by the Communist Party, we can only rely mainly on our own strength and engage in long-term hard work and self-reliance to make our country prosperous and to gradually achieve common prosperity for the people. The Kuomintang reactionary government left us with a mess of a country. Under the Party's correct leadership, we insisted on independence and self-reliance, with self-reliance as the mainstay and seeking foreign aid as a supplement. Through hard work and self-reliance, we finally established an independent and relatively complete industrial and national economic system in the 1960s. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the level of economic development and the standard of living of the people in our country have significantly improved, and we have basically solved the problem of subsistence for 1.1 billion people, making our country a relatively prosperous socialist country. Our future strategic task for economic development is to achieve a moderately prosperous society by the end of this century and to achieve a moderately developed level by the middle of the next century. This is a grand goal. What will enable us to achieve it? It will still be through hard work and self-reliance under the Party's leadership. "Looking back at the achievements of past dynasties, success comes from diligence and thrift, while failure comes from extravagance and waste." This ancient proverb tells us: a country that abandons the virtue of diligence and thrift and indulges in extravagance and waste has no hope or future. Only by being diligent and thrifty and persevering in hard work and self-reliance can we continuously achieve success. Our country has a large population, a weak foundation, and relatively scarce per capita resources. Our per capita GDP still ranks low in the world, and we face many difficulties in economic and social development. Therefore, although our lives are better than before, we still need to emphasize diligence and thrift, and to make diligence and thrift the norm for all undertakings in society. Due to the accumulation of problems in the economy over the past few years, during the current period of rectifying and adjusting the national economy, we need to make even greater efforts. The central authorities have proposed that we should be prepared to tighten our belts for a few years and take the most resolute measures to significantly reduce the scale of fixed asset investment and suspend or delay the construction of a large number of projects. This is completely correct. This is one of the keys to overcoming the current economic difficulties. All localities and departments must serve the overall situation and make a great effort to solve this problem. We must not act on our own and must not allow localism. We must also strive to increase production and save money, increase revenue and reduce expenditures, and like during the war years, advocate saving every copper coin to support the war, we should advocate saving every penny, every grain of rice, every watt of electricity, and every drop of water to support the construction of socialist modernization. Whether it is individuals, families, collectives, or the state, we should all do this.

The spirit of hard work and self-reliance is not just about diligence and thrift and hard work and self-reliance. It also has a deeper meaning: for the common interests and common ideals of the state, the nation, and the people, for the development of the socialist cause, to fear no difficulties and to spare no sacrifices in a tenacious struggle. In this sense, in the entire historical stage of socialism, all those who love their country and hope for the prosperity of the state and the wealth of the people, in every field and every industry, generation after generation, should strive to possess and carry forward this spirit. Practice has proven that as long as we arm the whole Party and the people of the whole country with this spirit, we will produce a powerful material force, be able to withstand any natural and social storms, and be able to create many miracles. Nuclear industry and aerospace industry were both blank fields in our country. Broad masses of scientific and technological personnel and workers started from scratch, worked hard, and withstood the pressure of the sudden unilateral abrogation of contracts by the assisting countries and the withdrawal of all experts, overcoming many unimaginable difficulties, making our country's nuclear industry and aerospace industry develop rapidly from nothing to something and from small to large. Now, China has entered the ranks of the world's advanced countries in these two fields and has become one of the few countries in the world today that possess relatively complete nuclear and aerospace technology and industry systems. Before liberation, "foreign oil" monopolized the oil market in our country. By 1949, the national crude oil production was only 120,000 tons. With outstanding scientists like Li Siguang as representatives, geologists worked hard and found rich oil resources in China. With "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi and others as representatives, broad masses of petroleum workers traveled south and north, starting from "dry construction" and successfully building several large oil fields. Now, our country's annual crude oil production has exceeded 130 million tons, making us one of the world's major oil-producing countries, not only self-sufficient but also able to export a certain amount of crude oil and refined oil. The more than 200 scientific and technological personnel of the Lanzhou Desert Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of the institute and the old experts, have worked for many years in the desert experimental station, where the conditions are very harsh. They devoted themselves to scientific research, making important contributions to the desertification treatment of our country, making our country's desertification treatment and research level in the world already leading. The institute has been awarded many times by the state, and in 1988, it was awarded the "Global Advanced Unit" by the United Nations Environment Programme. The comrades in these departments all have a great spiritual force, for a lofty ideal, lifelong dedication, selfless dedication, and selfless work. Practice has proven that whether it is a work unit or a worker, those who have achieved something have all gone through long-term hard work and self-reliance, and those who want to achieve something must also go through long-term hard work and self-reliance. This is not only true for production departments and scientific and technological departments, but also for ideological departments. For example, ideological and political work among young people is not an easy task. It is necessary to go deep into the young people, make friends with them, and with an equal and sincere attitude, have heart-to-heart talks and exchange views, using methods that young people are willing to accept, and with targeted propaganda, explain to them the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and answer the various questions they are concerned about. We must affirm the young people's strong sense of progress and the least conservative thinking, which is the most active and vigorous force in the whole society, and at the same time, we must frankly point out their shortcomings and put forward strict requirements for them, and give them correct guidance. We must inherit the good traditions of ideological and political work in the past, and at the same time, we must constantly reform and innovate with the development of the times. There

    永远坚持艰苦奋斗的优良传统
    宋任穷
    艰苦奋斗是我们党在长期革命斗争中形成和发展起来的优良传统。几十年来，我们党坚持发扬艰苦奋斗精神，团结全国各族人民，在不同的历史时期顶住种种压力，战胜无数困难，取得一个又一个的胜利。艰苦奋斗的精神是我们党思想建设的一项重要内容，也是社会主义精神文明建设的一个重要组成部分。最近几年，由于受党中央主要领导同志错误的影响，艰苦奋斗讲得少了，艰苦奋斗的风气日渐淡薄了，这是我们的思想政治工作和精神文明建设中的一个严重失误，应当引起我们的足够重视。
    在战争年代，斗争环境十分艰苦和残酷，不论是解放区还是敌占区，不论是在前方作战还是在敌后进行地下斗争，没有崇高的理想和坚定的政治立场，不进行坚韧不拔的艰苦努力和前仆后继的英勇奋斗，我们就站不住脚，就有被消灭的危险。艰苦奋斗成为革命力量生存和发展所必不可少的条件。当年的井冈山精神、长征精神、延安精神，都包含艰苦奋斗这个重要组成部分。
    我们取得了政权，进入和平建设时期，条件发生了根本的变化，还要不要艰苦奋斗呢？回答是肯定的。我们是共产党领导的社会主义国家，只有主要依靠自己的力量，进行长期的艰苦奋斗，才能使国家富强起来，使人民逐步实现共同富裕。国民党反动政府留给我们的是一个满目疮痍的烂摊子，我们在党的正确领导下，坚持独立自主，以自力更生为主，争取外援为辅，经过艰苦奋斗，终于在60年代建立起独立的比较完整的工业体系和国民经济体系。党的十一届三中全会以后，我国的经济发展水平和人民的生活水平又有显著的提高，基本上解决了十一亿人口的温饱问题，使我国成为初步繁荣昌盛的社会主义国家。我们今后经济发展的战略任务，是要在本世纪末实现小康水平，进而在下个世纪中叶实现中等发达水平，这是一个宏伟的目标。要实现它靠什么？仍然要靠在党的领导下自力更生、艰苦奋斗。“历览前贤国与家，成由勤俭败由奢。”古人留下的这个格言告诉我们：舍弃勤俭的美德而迷恋奢靡之风的国家是没有希望和前途的，只有克勤克俭，坚持艰苦创业，才能不断取得成功。我们国家人口众多，底子薄弱，人均占有的资源并不丰富，人均国民生产总值仍居于世界后列，经济和社会的发展中面临的困难很多。因此，虽然我们的日子比过去好了，但是仍然需要十分强调勤俭节约，勤俭办一切事业，要使艰苦朴素成为全社会的风尚。由于前几年经济方面积累的问题比较多，在当前对国民经济进行治理、整顿期间，需要我们进行更加艰苦的努力，中央提出要准备过几年紧日子，特别要采取最坚决的措施，大力压缩固定资产投资规模，继续停缓建一大批基建项目，是完全正确的。这是克服当前经济困难的关键之一。各地、各部门都要服从大局，下大决心解决好这个问题，决不能各自为政，决不允许搞本位主义。我们还要努力增产节约，增收节支，像战争时期提倡节省每一个铜板支援战争那样，提倡节省一分钱、一两粮、一度电、一滴水，支援社会主义现代化建设。不论是个人、家庭、集体还是国家，都应当这样。
    艰苦奋斗精神，不只是勤俭节约和艰苦朴素，它还有更深一层的含义，就是为了国家、民族和人民的共同利益与共同理想，为了发展社会主义事业，不怕任何困难，不惜任何牺牲而顽强奋斗的进取精神和奉献精神。从这个意义上讲，在整个社会主义的历史阶段，各条战线、各行各业的一切热爱祖国、希望国家富强和人民富裕的人，一代接一代，都应当努力具有和发扬这种精神。实践已经证明，只要坚持用这种精神武装全党和全国人民，就会产生出强大的物质力量，就能抵御任何自然的和社会的风浪，就可以创造出许多人间奇迹来。核工业和航天工业在我国原来都是空白，广大科技人员和职工白手起家，努力奋斗，顶住了援助国家突然单方面撕毁合同，撤走全部专家的压力，战胜了许多难以想象的困难，使我国的核工业和航天工业从无到有、从小到大地迅速发展起来。现在，中国在这两个领域都已跻身于世界先进的行列，成为当今少数几个拥有比较完整的核科技工业和航天科技工业体系的国家之一。解放前，“洋油”垄断了我国的石油市场，到1949年，全国原油产量仅12万吨。以杰出科学家李四光为代表的地质工作者，经过艰苦的努力，在中国的土地上找到了丰富的石油资源。以“铁人”王进喜等为代表的广大石油职工走南闯北，从“干打垒”起家，成功地建成了几个大油田。现在我国原油年产量已超过1.3亿吨，成为世界主要产油国之一，不仅可以自给，还能出口一定数量的原油和成品油。中国科学院兰州沙漠研究所200多位科技人员，在所领导和老专家的亲自带领下，长年在治沙实验站工作，条件十分艰苦。他们一心一意搞科研，为我国的治沙事业做出了重要贡献，使我国沙漠化治理和研究水平在国际上已处于领先地位。该所多次受到国家的表彰，1988年被联合国环境署授予“全球先进单位”。这些部门的同志们身上都有一股巨大的精神力量，为了崇高的理想，终生不为名，不为利，无私奉献，忘我工作。实践证明，无论是工作单位，还是工作人员，凡是成就了一番事业的，都经过了长期的艰苦奋斗，凡是想成就一番事业的，也必须经过长期的艰苦奋斗。不仅生产部门和科技部门是这样，思想意识领域的各部门也是如此。譬如对青年的思想政治工作，要真正搞好并非易事。要深入到青年中去，同他们交朋友，以平等、诚恳的态度，推心置腹地同他们谈心、交换看法，用青年人乐于接受的方式，有针对性地向他们宣传马列主义、毛泽东思想的基本原理，回答他们所关心的各种问题。既要肯定青年人上进心强，最少保守思想，是整个社会中最积极最有生气的力量，又要开诚布公地指出他们的不足，向他们提出严格的要求，进行正确的引导。既要继承以往思想政治工作的好传统，又要随着时代的发展不断进行改革和创新。这里面有不少学问，需要以艰苦奋斗的精神，下一番苦功夫悉心钻研。社会科学领域里各门学科的研究也一样，要用马列主义、毛泽东思想的基本原理为指导，认真地研究新时期出现的新情况、新问题，并对此作出令人信服的、科学的理论与实践相结合的分析，不下苦功夫，是做不出成果的，这里也要有一番艰苦奋斗。从事任何工作，丢了艰苦奋斗的精神，都不可能有什么作为。
    在改革开放的形势下，强调艰苦奋斗精神尤为重要。坚持改革开放，是我们建设的总方针。在当今国际经济关系越来越密切的情况下，任何国家都不可能在封闭状态下求得发展。我国各方面的基础都比较薄弱，更要努力学习和引进世界各国包括社会主义国家也包括资本主义发达国家的先进的科学技术、反映社会化大生产规律的科学、经济、行政管理经验以及一切于我们有益的东西，真正把它们学到手。同时，要结合中国的实际情况，努力加以发展和创新，以加快我们的社会主义现代化建设。这是一项十分复杂和困难的任务，需要发奋努力，艰苦奋斗。在引进国外的技术和设备时，要审慎选择，厉行节约，把有限的外汇用到最急需的地方。而我们在这方面存在着严重的浪费现象。如盲目引进、重复引进国外生产线和设备，进口我国完全有能力制造的设备，甚至发生把我国制造的设备重新从国外买回来这样的怪事。我们还花费巨额外汇进口大量高级轿车、家用电器，甚至连化妆品、烟酒和饮料等也从国外大量进口。凡此种种，严重背离了艰苦奋斗精神，引起广大群众不满，应当引以为训。另一方面，在对外开放的过程中，还必然会带进来一些不健康的东西，对此我们要有清醒的头脑，要提高警惕，增强自身的免疫力。如果我们政治上不坚定，丢了艰苦奋斗精神，就会走到邪路上去，容易被各种糖衣炮弹打中，成为资产阶级自由化和腐朽思想的俘虏。
    将来，我们生活好起来了，达到小康水平以至中等发达国家水平了，还要不要艰苦奋斗呢？社会的发展是不停顿的，人类的进步是无止境的，我们始终面临着继续奋斗的目标，因此，艰苦奋斗的精神永远不能丢。即使到了共产主义社会，也是如此。不论社会发展到哪个阶段，艰苦奋斗精神都是促进经济发展和社会全面进步的动力，而与艰苦奋斗相悖的因循守旧、贪图安逸、奢侈挥霍等都只能败坏社会风气，腐蚀人民的斗志，成为社会前进的障碍。我从报上看到富国崇尚节约的一则消息，说瑞士重视回收废旧物资，利用回收的旧书报造纸浆，以此减少60％的进口。可见，富国的人民，不少仍保持着节约的风尚。中华民族素有勤俭节约的良好传统。在我国，大多数人是注意节约的，但是这几年不注意节约和“一切向钱看”的不良风气在一部分单位和同志中间逐渐蔓延开来，有的地方和部门还相当严重。报上有这样一则消息，标题是《国家进口废纸，工厂寻觅废纸，群众难卖废纸》，说的是居民抱怨卖废纸难，但一些造纸厂不得不花费大量外汇进口纸浆。同上述瑞士的做法两相对照，值得我们深思。目前，我们的生产水平大大低于发达国家，但有些人却要在生活享受上同人家攀比，搞“高消费”，衣、食、住、行、用，什么都追求高档的，有的还以使用进口货为荣。这不仅严重脱离我国的国情，也败坏了党风和社会风气。我国人民的生活水平还比较低，应该也只能随着国民经济的发展不断有所提高，上述这股“高消费”的歪风必须刹住，不然贻害无穷。
    毛泽东、周恩来同志等老一辈无产阶级革命家身体力行，为我们树立了艰苦奋斗的榜样。他们领导全国人民，为民族的解放、国家的独立富强、人民的幸福，艰苦奋斗了一生，无私地奉献了自己的一切。他们在日常的工作、生活中勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的许多感人事迹在人民群众中间传为美谈。老一辈革命家的艰苦奋斗精神同他们光辉的革命理论，都成为全党和全国人民的宝贵精神财富。以江泽民同志为核心的新的领导集体又大力提倡艰苦奋斗精神，并在廉政建设方面采取了切实的措施，带了好头。愿全党全社会共同努力，在坚持四项基本原则的同时，大力弘扬艰苦奋斗精神，从中央到地方，从领导到群众，都从我做起，以勤俭节约、艰苦朴素、积极进取、无私奉献为荣，以挥霍浪费、奢侈腐败、因循守旧、贪图安逸为耻，
  使艰苦奋斗精神在我国蔚然成风，并随着我们事业的不断前进而代代相传。　（原载1989年第19期《求是》杂志　新华社发）
