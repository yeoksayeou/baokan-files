The first Asian Fencing Championship entered its second day today. In the men's foil individual final held this evening, South Korean athletes Kim Seong-Hyeok and Yu Byung-Hea won the gold and silver medals respectively, while Chinese athlete Zhang Zhicheng took the third place.

Among the eight athletes who entered the men's foil final, China had three representatives, and South Korea had four. This year's World Junior Champion, Chinese athlete Ye Chong, had a technical breakdown in his match against South Korean athlete Kim Seong-Hyeok and lost 1-10. Another young Chinese athlete, this year's national champion Wang Lihong, led 8-5 but faltered in his attack, eventually losing 9-11 to South Korean athlete Choi Sung-Ki.

Since the 10th Asian Games, when China's men's foil team lost to the South Korean team in both the team and individual events, the two sides have had few opportunities to compete against each other. However, through this men's foil competition, it is evident that South Korean athletes have made significant progress in terms of technical finesse and aggressive attacks. Chinese men's foil team coach Wang Fuyun told reporters that today's Chinese athletes did not perform to their potential, which may be due to the psychological pressure of competing at home. However, he also admitted that the key issue is that they lacked the courage to fight when it mattered most. Wang Fuyun said that in the World Fencing Championships, Chinese athletes ranked ahead of South Korean athletes, but often found themselves at a disadvantage when facing them. This situation is worth pondering. Some people here believe that the loss of the Chinese men's foil team in this warm-up match before the 1990 Asian Games is not necessarily a bad thing. It helps us to more clearly see our own shortcomings and weaknesses.

### 亚洲击剑赛男子花剑个人决赛  中国选手临场怯阵痛失金银牌

    亚洲击剑赛男子花剑个人决赛
    中国选手临场怯阵痛失金银牌
    本报北京10月9日讯　记者陈昭报道：第一届亚洲击剑锦标赛今日进入第二天。在今晚进行的男子花剑个人决赛中，南朝鲜选手金成杓和柳奉馨分别获得冠亚军，中国运动员张志诚获得第三名。
    进入男子花剑决赛的八名选手中，中国有三人，南朝鲜有四人。很有希望问鼎的今年世界青年锦标赛冠军、我国选手叶冲，在与南朝鲜运动员金成杓的比赛中技术水准失常，竟以1∶10败北。另一名中国小将、今年的全国冠军王利宏在8∶5领先的情况下，反而进攻手软，被南朝鲜崔承基以11∶9击败。
    自第十届亚运会我国男花选手在团体与个人项目上输给南朝鲜队后，这三年双方交锋机会甚少。但是通过本届男子花剑比赛，反映出南朝鲜选手有技术细腻、进攻勇猛的新的进步。中国男子花剑队教练王福云对记者说，今天中国选手没有发挥出应有水平，这可能与在家门口比赛、心理负担重有关。不过他也承认，关键时刻手软，不敢拚，恐怕是今晚决赛失利的最大症结。王福云说，在世界击剑锦标赛上我国选手排名在南朝鲜选手前，但是和他们对垒时却常处于下风，这一状况值得深思。此间人士认为，中国男花选手在明年亚运会前的这次热身赛上失利，未尝不是一件好事，它对于我们更加清醒地看到自己的不足与缺陷大有益处。
