    Fire-resistant anti-static materials have been developed in Tianjin. The Tianjin North Construction Anti-Static Materials Factory has successfully researched and developed anti-static adhesives and coatings. These materials provide an ideal solution for preventing accidents and fires caused by static electricity, filling a gap in China's anti-static product market. Experimental results show that using these anti-static materials to renovate computer rooms, adhere to steel and wooden structural activity floors, and coat equipment can effectively prevent interference and prevent fires.
