Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 23rd.

The autumn chrysanthemums are in bloom, and guests have come from afar. The Shanghai Hongqiao Grand Theater opened its doors of friendship today to welcome domestic and foreign guests to the opening ceremony of the "1989 International Science and Education Film Festival."

Science and education films have become an effective means of spreading knowledge. Although China's science and education films started late, they have developed rapidly. Since the founding of the nation, more than seventy science and education films have won awards at international film festivals, and there are nearly a hundred institutions in the country that produce science and education films.

Over the next five days, Chinese and foreign science and education film industry professionals will watch eighty-five excellent science and education films and engage in academic exchanges and other activities. These films come from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, East Germany, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Hungary, India, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, the United States, and twenty-three other countries.

According to the organizers of the film festival, the Broadcasting Film and Television Administration, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and the China Science and Education Film Association, the content of the films is rich. Some are known for their novel subjects, some for their superb cinematography, and many have won multiple awards at international film festivals. They cover a wide range of fields, including humans, the Earth, the universe, bacteria, the ocean, and more, reflecting the current level of scientific development.

At the opening ceremony, Chen Haosu, chairman of the film festival committee, delivered a speech. He said, "The film festival, themed 'The Science of Life,' symbolizes that our science and education film industry and our friendship with filmmakers from various countries have a strong vitality." Shanghai Vice Mayor Liu Zhenyuan said in his speech, "To provide an opportunity for science and education film artists from various countries to exchange and learn from each other is a source of pride for Shanghai." After the ceremony, three science and education films were screened: China's "Holographic Embryo - A New Discovery in Biology," North Korea's "Fertilization in Water," and the Netherlands' "Living in a Flower Garden."

Over a thousand domestic and foreign audiences, including Suzanne Duval, Secretary-General of the International Science Film Association, and representatives from foreign consulates in Shanghai, attended today's opening ceremony.

    科教电影如今已成为传播知识的有效途径之一。中国科教电影起步虽晚，但发展较快。建国以来已有七十余部科教片在国际电影节上获奖，目前国内有拍摄科教片的机构近百家。
    中外科教电影界人士在电影节的五天时间内，将观看八十五部优秀科教片，并举行学术交流等活动。这些影片来自澳大利亚、奥地利、比利时、保加利亚、加拿大、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、法国、民主德国、联邦德国、英国、匈牙利、印度、日本、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、摩洛哥、荷兰、新西兰、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联、美国等二十三个国家。
    据电影节主办单位广播电影电视部、上海市人民政府和中国科教影视协会介绍，参展影片内容丰富，有些以取材新颖著称，有些以摄影技术高超见长，不少影片还多次在国际电影节上获奖。它们涉及人类地球、宇宙、细菌、海洋等诸多领域，反映了当今科学发展的水平。
    开幕式上，电影节组委会主席陈昊苏致贺词。他说，电影节以“生命的科学”为主题，这象征着我们的科教电影事业，我们和各国电影工作者的友谊都具有强大的生命力。上海市副市长刘振元在讲话中说：“能为各国科教电影艺术家提供一个相互交流和切磋的机会，是上海的光彩”。会后放映了中国的《全息胚——生物科学的新发现》、朝鲜的《水中受精》和荷兰的《生活在花卉丛中》三部科教片。
    国际科学电影协会秘书长苏珊娜·杜瓦尔、外国驻沪领事馆的代表等千余名中外观众出席了今天的开幕式。
