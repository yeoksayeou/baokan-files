The development and construction of the Second Oilfield has taken a new step forward. Over 15,000 petroleum workers have been engaged in a tough battle on the grasslands of Alxa in Inner Mongolia. Since April of last year, they have basically completed the engineering plan for an annual oil production capacity of 100 million tons. They have achieved the goal of completing a three-year project in two years. The 365-kilometer oil pipeline from Alxa to Saihan Tala, constructed by the engineering troops where Lei Feng once served, was completed ahead of schedule in less than a year and began transporting oil on September 11. The construction of the Hohhot Refinery has also commenced.

The Second Oilfield began exploration in 1979. In March 1988, the oilfields in the Alxa region were the first to be developed, with a plan to reach an annual production capacity of 100 million tons of crude oil. To this end, the North China Petroleum Administration Bureau immediately organized the Second Oil Exploration and Development Company and 12 other affiliated units to participate in the battle. Over 15,000 petroleum workers braved the harsh cold and snow, successively heading to the northern frontier of the motherland. In the first year of the battle, they completed the engineering task of producing 10 million tons of oil, successfully conducted winter test production, and officially started production in March of this year. Currently, the daily crude oil production capacity has reached 1,400 tons.

The high speed and high level of development and construction of the Second Oilfield are the result of combining the reform of the management system, the adoption of advanced scientific technology, and the promotion of the Daqing spirit of hard work and perseverance. The project implements a contract responsibility system, introducing a competitive mechanism. The participating construction units also implement layer-by-layer division and project contracting; economically, they implement quota management based on specifications, with frontline workers' wages higher than those of second-line workers. This makes the responsibilities for various projects clear, speeds up the progress, and improves the quality.

Due to the complex nature of this oilfield, which is located in a high-altitude, cold, low-pressure, and low-permeability region, the difficulty of exploitation is great. Before the oilfield battle began in early 1988, the relevant leading departments organized experts from various fields to formulate a development plan, requiring the use of 8 advanced technologies to reach the advanced development level of the 1980s. Since the battle began, the Second Oilfield has completed the state-level key research and development project "Drilling and Completion Technology for Low-Pressure and Low-Permeability Oilfields in the Second Oilfield Region" and the department-level key research and development project "Exploration and Development Supporting Technology for Low-Pressure and Low-Permeability Oilfields in Alxa South." In geology, oil reservoir engineering, drilling and production technology, and other eight aspects, new levels have been achieved.

The Daqing spirit of hard work and perseverance has been fully carried forward on the battlefield. The person in charge of the Second Company believes: "It's not enough to just talk about contracting and material rewards; people still need spirit." Under the conditions of reforming the management system and reducing personnel, this company has maintained and strengthened the political work institutions and teams, improved the party and youth league organizations at all levels, and insisted on using the effective experience of Daqing in starting production from ideology and starting ideology from production. This fully plays the advantages of ideological and political work. The Alxa region has an altitude of over 1,000 meters, with a frost-free period of only 70-80 days a year. During the cold season, the temperature can drop to -30 to -40 degrees Celsius, and there are often blizzards (snowstorms) and sandstorms, sometimes reaching 7-8 levels. In such a harsh natural environment, the battle workers bravely struggle, overcome various production and living difficulties, and maintain a strong fighting spirit. They have emerged as a group of outstanding individuals. The battle workers take pride in hardship and are willing to contribute, which is a powerful guarantee for the rapid development of the Second Oilfield.

### 靠科学管理　靠技术进步　靠大庆精神  二连油田开发初战告捷  目前原油日产能力已达1400吨

　　靠科学管理　靠技术进步　靠大庆精神
　　二连油田开发初战告捷
　　目前原油日产能力已达1400吨
    本报讯　二连油田的开发建设迈出了新的步伐。1.5万多名石油职工，在内蒙古草原阿尔善地区艰苦会战，自去年4月至今，已基本完成了年产100万吨石油产能的工程计划，取得了三年工程两年基本完成的好成绩。与此相配套的阿尔善至赛汉塔拉365公里的输油管道，由雷锋生前所在的工程兵某团艰苦奋战，用时不到一年，已于9月11日提前完工，开始转运原油；呼和浩特炼油厂的建设，也已动工。
    二连油田是1979年开始勘探的大油田。1988年3月，阿尔善地区的油田率先投入开发，计划达到年产100万吨原油的水平。为此，华北石油管理局立即组织二连石油勘探开发公司和局属其他12个单位参加会战，1.5万多名石油职工冒着严寒风雪，陆续开赴祖国北疆草原。会战第一年，即已完成产能10万吨的工程任务，冬季试采油成功，今年3月正式投产。目前原油日产能力已达1400吨。
    二连油田开发建设的高速度、高水平，是改革管理体制、采用先进科学技术与发扬大庆艰苦奋斗精神相结合的产物。工程实行项目承包，引进了竞争机制。参加施工的单位也实行层层分解，项目承包；在经济上实行按规格定额管理，职工工资一线高于二线，从而使各项工程责任明确，速度加快，质量提高。
    由于这个油田是一个高原高寒地区低压低渗透的复杂油田，开采难度大，去年初在油田会战之前，有关领导部门就组织各方面专家编制了开发方案，要求采用8项先进技术，达到80年代先进开发水平。会战至今，二连油田承担的国家重点攻关课题“二连地区低压低渗透油田的钻井完井技术”、部级攻关课题“阿南低压低渗透油田勘探开发配套技术”的试验任务，均告完成。在油田地质、油藏工程、钻采工艺等8个方面创造了新水平。
    大庆艰苦奋斗的精神，在会战工地得到充分发扬。二连公司负责人认为：“光讲承包和物质奖励不行，人还是要讲精神的。”在改革管理体制、人员减少的情况下，这家公司保持并充实了政工机构和队伍，健全了各级党团组织，坚持运用大庆行之有效的抓生产从思想入手、抓思想从生产出发的一系列工作经验，充分发挥了思想政治工作的优势。阿尔善地区海拔1000多米，全年无霜期只有七八十天，严寒季节气温低到零下30—40摄氏度，经常刮白毛风（风卷雪）、黄毛风
  （风卷砂），有时高达7、8级。在这样艰苦的自然环境中，会战职工勇敢拚搏，克服生产、生活上的各种困难，始终保持着旺盛的斗志，涌现出一批优秀人物。会战职工以苦、为荣，乐于奉献，是二连油田高速开发的有力保证。
