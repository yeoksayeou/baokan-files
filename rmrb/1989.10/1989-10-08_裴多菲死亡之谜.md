Petőfi Sándor is the most beloved, revered, and proud figure of the Hungarian people in the 19th century revolutionary poet. His short life was filled with many brilliant poems full of revolutionary passion and fighting spirit. However, his remains did not rest on the land of his beloved homeland for which he sacrificed his life. The exact location of Petőfi's death and burial remains a mystery to this day.

Recently, news of finding the poet's remains in Siberia has shocked the entire Hungarian nation.

Petőfi began writing at the age of 19. He not only called upon the people to overthrow the reactionary rule with his passionate and uplifting poetry, but also participated in the Hungarian national liberation struggle of 1848-1849, holding a pen in one hand and a gun in the other, "advancing against the fierce cannon fire."

It is said that Petőfi died under the bayonets of Russian soldiers during the battle of Segesvár against the Russian-Austrian invasion on July 31, 1849. His body was likely buried in a mass grave.

However, there is a folk tale in Hungary that after returning from Russia, a captured Hungarian soldier revealed that Petőfi was captured by the Russian army and sought refuge with the Tsar. In the mid-18th century, he lived in Barguzin (now in the Buryat Autonomous Republic of the former Soviet Union). It is said that the poet changed his name to Alexander Petrovich and became a neighbor of the Decembrist Ksushchov-Bekovich. He also married the daughter of the local postmaster.

Based on this clue, a wealthy Hungarian businessman, Ferenc Morvai, decided to fund a million forints to support an expedition to Siberia to verify this information.

On July 13 of this year, a 23-person expedition team composed of famous Hungarian, American, and Soviet archaeologists and anthropologists arrived in Barguzin. They began excavations in an ancient cemetery in the area. On July 17, they found the grave and remains of the Decembrist Ksushchov-Bekovich. At the same time, they found another grave 8 meters away from the first. The grave contained a body without a coffin. The intact skeleton, after preliminary examination by several experts, showed characteristics that matched the descriptions of Petőfi in some famous literary works. However, there were differing opinions among the expedition members.

In Budapest, scientists have preserved a lock of Petőfi's hair; in the Hungarian capital, the poet's parents are also buried. Therefore, after further genetic and anthropological research, the truth of the matter will be revealed.

However, most Hungarians are puzzled: how can one believe that a revolutionary poet, a symbol of freedom and independence, could live silently in a foreign land? Because Petőfi once expressed in a poem that he wanted to die on the battlefield and rest under the hooves of horses...

    裴多菲死亡之谜
    唐秀山
    裴多菲·山多尔是匈牙利人民最热爱、最崇敬并引以为骄傲的19世纪革命诗人。他短暂的一生写下了许多充满革命激情和战斗力的闪光诗篇，但是他的尸骨却未能留在他为之献身的可爱祖国的土地上。裴多菲究竟死在哪里，葬在何方，至今是一个谜。
    最近，一条关于在西伯利亚找到诗人遗骨的消息轰动了整个匈牙利。
    裴多菲19岁开始创作，不仅以激越昂扬的诗号召人民起来推翻反动统治，而且在1848—1849年匈牙利民族解放斗争中还参加革命军，一手拿笔，一手拿枪，“迎着猛烈的炮火进击”。
    据说裴多菲在反抗俄奥联军侵略的舍格什瓦尔战斗中，于1849年7月31日死在沙俄士兵的长矛下，尸体可能被埋入了合葬墓。
    但在匈牙利民间还流传说，当时从俄国归来的匈牙利被俘军人曾透露过，裴多菲被俄军俘获后向沙皇要求避难了。18世纪中叶，他住在巴尔古津（今苏联布里亚特自治共和国境内）。据说当时诗人改名为亚历山大·彼得罗维奇，做了十二月党人屈谢尔贝克尔的邻居，还同当地邮政局长的女儿结了婚。
    根据这条线索，匈牙利一位富有的企业家费伦茨·莫尔瓦依决定出资千万福林，资助一个考察队到西伯利亚去考证此事。
    今年7月13日，一个由匈牙利、美国、苏联著名考古学家和人类学家组成的23人考察队到达巴尔古津后，在当地的古公墓开始发掘。7月17日他们找到了十二月党人屈谢尔贝克尔的坟墓和遗骨，同时在离该墓8米远的地方找到了另一坟墓。墓中埋着一具没有棺木的尸体。起出的完整骸骨经几位专家的初步考证，其各种特征与一些著名文学作品所描述的裴多菲的体征相符。不过考察队员之间有不同看法。
    在布达佩斯，科学工作者保存着裴多菲的一束头发；在匈牙利首都还埋葬着诗人的双亲。因此，经过进一步的遗传学和人类学研究，此事真相不难大白。
    然而大多数匈牙利人感到迷惑：怎么能相信，一位最革命的诗人，自由和独立的象征，竟然会无声无息地生活在异国他乡？因为裴多菲曾在一首诗中表示他要死在战场，在马蹄下安息……
