Millions in the capital hold grand celebration for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China

BEIJING, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- More than a million people from all walks of life in the capital held various activities centered around a grand celebration at Tiananmen Square tonight to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Jiang Zemin, Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Chen Yun, Wan Li, Li Xiannian, Peng Zhen, Deng Yingchao, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhen and other leaders, as well as Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Democratic Kampuchea and his wife, Vice Chairman Li Chong-yu of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea, Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Vice Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic, Egon Krenz, Chairman of the National Assembly of Pakistan, Malik Meraj Khalid, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Miroslav Zavagil, long-time friend of the Chinese people, Huang Wenhuan, and Vice Chairman of the Soviet-China Friendship Association, former First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, I. V. Arkhipov, attended the celebration on Tiananmen Rostrum.

At 7 p.m., Vice Premier Chen Xitong announced the start of the mass celebration on Tiananmen Rostrum. The entire audience stood in silence as the military band played the national anthem. A salute of 28 guns was fired. At this moment, more than 1,000 workers from the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation held up red and yellow ribbons to form a giant national flag and the number "1949-1989." The solemn "Flower Offering Song" led a group of young pioneers dressed in the costumes of 56 ethnic groups to present four large flower baskets symbolizing the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and 56 small flower baskets representing the 56 ethnic groups of the nation to the Monument to the People's Heroes. The young pioneers solemnly pledged: "We will inherit the cause of the martyrs and be ready to fight for the cause of communism—always ready!"

The celebration began. The military band played "Singing of Our Motherland," "We Workers Have Strength," "In the Field of Hope," "The Red Sun Never Sets," and other songs. On the square, lion dances and dragon dances were performed. Seventeen lions and seven dragons rolled across the ground, and a 45-meter-long giant dragon soared and twisted, symbolizing the vitality and prosperity of our great motherland.

After the ceremony, lively dance music filled the air. Workers, peasants, students, government officials, scientists, artists, and soldiers from the Beijing garrison danced joyfully to the music. In 14 celebration areas, hundreds of dance circles bloomed like flowers. Professional and amateur art troupes performed wonderful programs. National labor models and advanced workers from all over the country also joined the dance circles on the square to celebrate with the people of Beijing.

The 30,000 workers representing the million workers of the capital were particularly active. Their performances of songs, dances, rhythmic gymnastics, magic, acrobatics, and flag-waving won rounds of applause. In the celebration area formed by 8,000 farmers from the suburbs, the farmers expressed their gratitude to the Party through their unique folk songs and dances.

In the middle of Tiananmen Square, in front of the national flagpole, was the "Steel Wall"—the celebration area of the People's Liberation Army. Many of them were the brave soldiers who suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion. A few months ago, at the order of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, they rushed to Beijing and suppressed the rebellion, defending our People's Republic through blood and fire. Some of the soldiers who participated in the clearing of Tiananmen Square at dawn on June 4 looked at the majestic and solemn Tiananmen Rostrum and the magnificent night scene, and their eyes were filled with tears. Political Department Director Xu Qixuan of a certain regiment of the Beijing Military Region told the reporter: "Look, how loudly they sing, how joyfully they dance. Their love for the Republic is deeply hidden in their songs and dances." This officer, who participated in the flower-spelling activity for the 20th anniversary of the founding of the nation 20 years ago as a new soldier and led the soldiers to participate in the clearing of Tiananmen Square at dawn on June 4 this year with his brother units, could not calm down for a long time. He said: "I want to shout: People's Republic, we love you, we will always be your loyal guards!"

At 7:20 p.m., clusters of fireworks soared into the sky, forming a series of colorful three-dimensional pictures. The words "Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation" in bright red were embedded in the magnificent picture. Tonight, fireworks were launched four times, each time for 15 minutes. The beams of 14 searchlights shone on the square, illuminating the colorful lights, creating a magnificent spectacle.

Tonight, 15,000 teachers and students from universities and secondary vocational schools in the capital also participated in the celebration. When they stepped onto the square with their youthful vigor and sang passionately with the masses to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, they were filled with mixed emotions. Cheng Haibin, a graduate student in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, said excitedly: "The fireworks are so beautiful!" He expressed his determination to cherish his precious youth, study Marxist theory, master scientific and cultural knowledge, and contribute to the construction of a great socialist motherland after graduation.

Nearly 20,000 guests on the stands on both sides of Tiananmen Square frequently burst into applause and cheers. Among them were labor models who had contributed to the prosperity and development of the motherland for decades; heroes of the People's Liberation Army who had made outstanding contributions to the stability and economic development of the country; founding heroes who had gone through the trials of war for the birth of New China; outstanding entrepreneurs who had made important contributions to reform and opening up and economic construction; outstanding officials who were honest and upright and served the people wholeheartedly; representatives of various democratic parties and non-partisan famous people; representatives of minority nationalities, compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, overseas Chinese; and foreign friends.

More than 100 Taiwanese compatriots who came specially to celebrate the 40th anniversary of our country were immersed in the joy of the square tonight. Chen Jimin, an old overseas Chinese from Chicago, USA, who rushed to participate in the grand celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, looked at the magnificent fireworks and the joyful crowd on the square and sighed: "Such a beautiful and magnificent scene can be seen nowhere else in the world. There is an old Chinese saying: 'At forty, one is not confused.' He believed that the motherland would definitely be more mature, more stable, and develop faster in the future.

Huang Weilu, 73, of the Second Research Institute of the Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics, is a famous missile and rocket expert in China. Facing the sky, he said to the reporter with emotion: "It's not easy! After 40 years of arduous and glorious journey, China's aerospace industry has grown from nothing to something, from small to large, and occupies an important position in the world's aerospace industry, boosting national prestige and inspiring the people. What is the secret? It is still the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the superiority of the socialist system, and our spirit of hard work and self-reliance."

Tonight, Beijing Workers' Stadium, Taoranting, Longtan Lake, Zhongguancun, Tongxian, Fengtai, Shijingshan, and Mentougou also launched fireworks and held various celebration activities.

    据新华社北京10月1日电　首都各界群众100多万人今天晚上举行以天安门广场联欢晚会为中心的各种活动，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年。
    江泽民、邓小平、杨尚昆、李鹏、陈云、万里、李先念、彭真、邓颖超、乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环、王震等同志，登上天安门城楼，和首都群众同庆佳节。
    在天安门城楼上参加庆祝活动的贵宾有民主柬埔寨主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和夫人，朝鲜劳动党中央政治局委员、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家副主席李钟玉，德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、中央书记、民主德国国务委员会副主席埃贡·克伦茨，巴基斯坦国民议会议长迈拉吉·哈立德，捷共中央主席团委员、工会主席米罗斯拉夫·扎瓦吉尔，中国人民的老朋友黄文欢，苏中友协副主席、苏联前部长会议第一副主席伊·瓦·阿尔希波夫等。
    晚7时整，国务委员、北京市市长陈希同在天安门城楼上宣布群众联欢晚会开始。全场肃立，军乐团高奏国歌，100门礼炮鸣炮28响。这时，面对天安门的千余名首钢工人手持红黄色带组成了巨幅国旗和“1949—1989”的年号图案。凝重的《献花曲》引导一群身着56个民族服装的少先队员，将表示中华人民共和国诞生40周年的4个大花篮和代表全国各民族的56个小花篮，敬献在人民英雄纪念碑前。少先队员庄严宣誓：“继承先烈遗志，准备着为共产主义事业而奋斗——时刻准备着！”
    联欢活动开始。军乐团员高奏《歌唱祖国》、《咱们工人有力量》、《在希望的田野上》、《鲜红的太阳永不落》等乐曲。广场上表演狮舞、龙舞，17头狮子与7条彩龙滚地而来，一条45米长的巨龙上下飞腾，左右翻动，形成“龙腾虎跃”之势，象征我们伟大的祖国生机勃发，蒸蒸日上。
    晚会仪式之后，悠扬欢快的舞曲响彻全场。首都工人、农民、学生、机关干部、科技人员、文艺工作者和人民解放军驻京部队指战员一起和着欢快的乐曲，翩翩起舞。14个联欢区数百个舞圈像朵朵鲜花盛开。一些专业和业余文艺团体竞相表演精彩的文艺节目。来自各地的全国劳模、先进工作者也进入广场舞圈和首都人民一起联欢。
    代表首都百万工人阶级参加今晚联欢活动的3万名工人格外活跃。他们表演的歌舞、韵律操、魔术、杂技、耍中幡等节目赢得了阵阵掌声。由京郊8000名农民组成的联欢区内，农民们用各具特色的民间歌舞来表达他们对党的感激之情。
    天安门广场中间的国旗杆前是“钢铁长城”——人民解放军的联欢区。他们之中有许多人是平息反革命暴乱的英勇卫士。几个月前，党中央、中央军委一声令下，他们奔赴北京一举平暴，为捍卫我们的人民共和国，经历了血与火的考验。一些6月4日凌晨参加天安门广场清场的战士，此刻望着巍然矗立、庄严肃穆的天安门城楼，望着这火树银花的绚丽夜景，怎能不热泪盈眶！北京军区某团政治处主任徐启宣对记者说：“你们看，这些战士唱得多响亮，跳得多欢快。歌声中、舞步里蕴藏着他们对共和国多么深情的爱。”这位20年前作为一名新战士参加国庆20周年的举花组字活动，今年6月4日凌晨又带领战士与兄弟部队一起参加天安门广场清场的军官，心情久久不能平静。他说：“我要高呼：人民共和国，我们热爱您，我们永远做您的忠实卫士！”
    晚7时20分，簇簇礼花腾空而起，交织成一幅幅五彩缤纷的立体画面，“庆祝建国四十周年”8个火红的大字，镶嵌在瑰丽的图画中。今晚的礼花共施放四次，每次15分钟。14盏探照灯的光束照射广场上空，与彩灯交相辉映，蔚为壮观。
    今晚，首都大学和中专的15000名师生也参加联欢。当他们迈着充满青春活力的步伐、放开热情的歌喉，与广大群众在广场共庆建国40周年的时候，百感交集。清华大学自动化系研究生郑海滨高兴地说：“礼花真美啊！”他表示要珍惜宝贵年华，学习马克思主义理论，掌握科学文化知识，毕业后为建设伟大的社会主义祖国做贡献。
    天安门广场两侧的观礼台上，近两万名观礼代表，不时爆发出掌声和欢呼声。他们中有几十年如一日为祖国的繁荣昌盛做出杰出贡献的劳动模范；有为国家的安宁和经济的发展建立丰功伟绩的人民解放军英雄；有为新中国的诞生历尽战争风霜的开国功臣；有在改革开放和经济建设中做出重要贡献的优秀企业家；有清正廉洁、全心全意为人民服务的优秀干部；有各民主党派和无党派知名人士；有少数民族参观团和港澳台同胞、海外华侨；还有外国朋友。
    专程来庆贺我国40周年华诞的100多名台湾同胞，今晚沉浸在广场欢乐的海洋里。从美国芝加哥赶来参加建国40周年大庆的老华侨陈济明望着满天的焰火和广场上欢乐的人群感叹说：这么美丽壮观的场面，在世界任何地方都看不到。中国有句古话：“四十而不惑。”他相信祖国在今后一定会更成熟、更稳定、更快地发展。
    航空航天部第二研究院73岁的黄纬禄是我国著名的导弹火箭专家。面对长空，他感慨地对记者说：“不容易啊！经过40年艰难而光辉的历程，我国的航天事业从无到有，从小到大，在世界的航天事业中占有重要地位，振国威、鼓民心，靠什么？还不是靠共产党的正确领导，靠社会主义制度的优越，靠我们艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神。”
    今晚，北京工人体育场、陶然亭、龙潭湖、中关村、通县、丰台、石景山、门头沟等处也施放焰火，举行各种联欢活动。
