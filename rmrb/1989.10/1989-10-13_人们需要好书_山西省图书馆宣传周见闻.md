Since the launch of the "anti-pornography" campaign, the book market has seen a significant improvement, and anxious parents have finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Some book merchants who prioritize "money first" are still struggling to find their way out of confusion and are at a loss, leading to a noticeable decline in the number of bookstalls on the streets. "What should we read?" "What should we read to our children?" These questions are on the minds of the elderly, middle-aged, and youth alike.

At this time, staff from the Shanxi Provincial Library and the Taiyuan City Library appeared on the streets of Taiyuan. In late September, the library promotion week activities were particularly eye-catching.

On the 26th, the rain fell steadily. At the promotion point, people were orderly in obtaining their library cards. The long queues for borrowing books made the nearby electronics stores envious. Feng Yingli, deputy director of the lending department at the Shanxi Provincial Library, said, "When it comes to book resources and quality, libraries are top-notch. However, the role of libraries in real life is quite weak, which is something worth reflecting on." Taking the public libraries in Shanxi Province as an example, the utilization rate of books is generally below 20%, and a considerable number of books have been "sleeping" in the library since they were acquired and have never been touched.

Feng Yingli said, "To improve the scientific and cultural level of the entire nation and enrich people's cultural lives, it is essential to run good libraries. The purpose of this promotion week is to attract people to use the library and read the best books. 'Anti-pornography' is necessary, but after 'anti-pornography,' if we do not use scientific and civilized materials to occupy the book market, the old things will come back, and new, unscientific things will also emerge."

This promotion week activity, in addition to promoting the functions and usage methods of the library, also distributed recommended reading lists, provided on-site book borrowing services, and handled library card applications.

    人们需要好书
    ——山西省图书馆宣传周见闻
    本报记者　阎晓明
    “扫黄”开展以来，图书市场为之一新，忧心忡忡的家长们终于松了一口气。
    一些信奉“金钱第一”的书商，尚未从迷茫中解脱出来，一时不知所措，街头巷尾的书摊顿时冷清了许多。“我们读什么？”“我们将给孩子们读什么？”老年、中年、青年都在发问。
    山西省图书馆和太原市图书馆的工作人员这时出现在太原的街头。9月下旬，图书馆宣传周活动格外引人注目。
    26日，秋雨绵绵。宣传点前，人们有条不紊地办理借书证。借阅图书的长队，让冷冷清清的家电商行羡慕不已。山西省图书馆借阅部副主任冯英利说：“要论图书资源，图书质量，图书馆是呱呱叫的。可是，图书馆在现实生活中的作用却十分微弱，这是很值得反思的。”以山西省的公共图书馆为例，图书利用率普遍不到20％，相当多的图书从入库起就“睡觉”，从未动过。
    冯英利说：“提高全民族的科学文化水平，丰富人们的文化生活，办好图书馆是必不可少的。我们这次宣传周活动，目的就是吸引人们利用图书馆，读最好的书。‘扫黄’是必需的，但‘扫黄’之后，如果不用科学、文明的东西占领图书市场，旧的东西会卷土重来，新的非科学的东西也会应运而生。”
    这次宣传周活动，除宣传图书馆的职能、使用方法外，还发放了推荐书目，现场为读者借阅图书，开展办理借书证业务等。
