Starting today, the Zhejiang Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, the Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau, the Public Security Department, and other relevant departments have launched a joint operation to decisively shut down the 20 cigarette black markets scattered across the province.

In the previous period, cigarette smuggling ships from Guangdong and Fujian sailed north to Zhejiang, making the province's cigarette black market transactions rampant. It is estimated that the annual transaction volume of the black market is about 400,000 cases, accounting for one-third of the province's total cigarette sales. As a result, the state suffers a tax revenue loss of several thousand yuan. Driven by profits, unlicensed individual cigarette vendors can be seen everywhere in urban and rural streets. Some wealthy cigarette vendors gather in major cigarette black markets to manipulate the market. In response to this situation, the Zhejiang Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the Provincial Government's Anti-Smuggling Office have decided to take action at sea, block at the shore, inspect on land, and manage the market. They will implement a comprehensive approach of striking, punishing, rectifying, educating, and managing to restore the normal order of cigarette circulation.

　　浙江取缔卷烟黑市
    据新华社杭州10月21日电　（记者陈坚发）从今日起，浙江省烟草专卖局、工商管理局、公安等部门联合行动，坚决取缔遍布全省的20个卷烟黑市。
    前一时期，海上卷烟走私贩私船只由广东、福建一带北上浙江，全省卷烟黑市交易十分猖獗。据估算，全省黑市年成交量约40万箱，占全省卷烟总销量的1／3，国家因此要损失税收数千万元。在利润的诱使下，全省城乡街头到处可见无证个体烟贩。一些财大气粗的烟贩则集结在各大卷烟黑市上操纵市场。针对这种状况，浙江省烟草专卖局、工商局、公安厅和省政府打击走私办公室决定海上抓，岸边堵，陆上查，市场管，打击、惩办、整顿、教育、管理五管齐下，恢复卷烟流通的正常秩序。
