The secretary of the Yao Research Association repeatedly instructed: When you arrive in Lìbō, Guizhou, you must visit Huang Hai.

Huang Hai is from Jiāngyǒng County, Hunan, and is of the Yao ethnicity. A few years ago, he graduated from the Central South University for Nationalities. After leaving school, he went straight to work at the Education Bureau of the Guizhou Province Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The previous year, during poverty alleviation efforts, he volunteered to go to the impoverished and backward Yao Lu Yao ethnic township to work on the ground.

On May 23rd of this year, in the afternoon, we arrived at the Yao Lu Yao ethnic township government in the Maolan Nature Reserve, accompanied by comrades from the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Nationalities Affairs. As soon as we got out of the car, we saw a new concrete stele prominently standing in front of us. The township head said, "This is the 'Request to Remain' stele erected by Huang Hai and the Yao people." The stele is about 1.5 meters high, and at the top of the front side, the words "Request to Remain" are written in large red characters.

My interview with Huang Hai began with this "Request to Remain" stele.

Huang Hai arrived in Yao Lu Yao ethnic township in March 1986 to organize the people to fight against drought and spring plowing. In 1987, he went to the township to work on poverty alleviation (serving as the deputy secretary of the township party committee). The facts he saw made him realize that the Yao people of Yao Lu were poor and backward, and their basic needs for food and clothing had not been met. What was even more worrying was that the old traditional ideas were still very prevalent. Ideas such as fatalism and waiting for aid were still strongly hindering the progress and development of the Yao region. The government had sent many clothes and fertilizers to the Yao region without charge, but the people thought it was a "bribe"; they were given diesel engines for pumping water, but they still wanted the government to provide unloading fees... Therefore, there was a saying in the local area: "The Yao mountains cannot be helped up, and the pits cannot be filled." How to help the Yao people get out of poverty and become prosperous? Huang Hai believed that it was necessary to first help them change their closed and backward traditional ideas.

He found a breakthrough in "inter-ethnic marriage." The people of Yao Lu have always practiced cross-cousin marriage, where the daughters of aunts and sisters must marry the sons of their uncles; otherwise, they have to compensate their uncles with nine cows. Gradually, this practice was reformed, allowing for free love without property restrictions. However, the two largest clans of the Yao people in the entire township, the Qín (Green Pants Yao) and Lǔ (White Pants Yao), still cannot intermarry (and even more so with other ethnic groups), causing great difficulties for the marriage of young men and women, and their interactions with the outside world are extremely rare, with inbreeding becoming increasingly serious. With the changes of the times, some people in the community have also requested to change this old custom. But some people said: To break these old ideas, only the provincial and state leaders can solve it. Huang Hai guided everyone to study ethnology and demography, and the entire township's People's Congress held a heated discussion on the issue of "inter-ethnic marriage" for the Qín and Lǔ, and even achieving complete "inter-ethnic marriage." Huang Hai and the cadres, village elders' understanding, and proposals were unanimously recognized by the attendees, and a resolution was formed. According to Yao customs: to erect a stele as evidence, and for future generations to follow. This is the origin of the "Request to Remain" stele. This matter was welcomed by the Qín and Lǔ Yao people, as well as all the Yao people in the county. On the day of the stele's erection, Yao people from the local township and neighboring two townships all came to participate in the grand stele-erecting ceremony. Since then, intermarriage between the Qín and Lǔ Yao clans, as well as between the Yao and other ethnic groups, has been legalized, and a trend has gradually formed in the Yao region. By the beginning of this year, 16 Yao Lu Yao youth had intermarried with people from other ethnic groups, including 11 couples with Han people, 4 couples with Water people, and 1 couple between the Qín and Lǔ clans.

As we talked and walked, everywhere we went was a scene of joy and busyness—children in the township's kindergarten were singing and dancing under the guidance of Yao aunts; the voices of students reciting their lessons echoed in the ethnic primary and secondary schools; the fields were filled with laughter and joy.

    瑶麓新碑
    陆群和
    瑶族研究学会秘书长一再叮嘱：到了贵州荔波，一定要去访问黄海。
    黄海是湖南江永县人，瑶族，前几年毕业于中南民族学院。离开学校以后，他直奔贵州省黔南布依族苗族自治州教育局工作。前年扶贫，他毅然报名到贫穷落后的瑶麓瑶族乡蹲点。
    今年5月23日下午，我们在贵州省民委的同志陪同下，来到茂兰自然保护区的瑶麓瑶族乡政府。一下车，就见眼前赫然竖着一块水泥新碑。乡长说：“这就是黄海同志领导瑶族同胞竖立起的“求留后记”碑。碑高约1.5米，正面上方用红漆写上“求留后记”四个大字。
    我对黄海的访问就从这块“求留后记”碑谈起。
    黄海于1986年3月来到瑶麓瑶族乡组织群众抗旱、春耕；1987年又到该乡挂职（任乡党委副书记）扶贫。事实使他看到：瑶麓瑶胞贫穷落后，饱暖问题还未解决，尤其使人忧虑的还是旧的传统观念十分严重。诸如听天由命、等待求援等思想依然顽强地阻碍着瑶乡的进步和发展。政府无偿地送了许多衣物、化肥给瑶乡，群众却认为这是“收买”他们；给他们送来抽水用的柴油机，他们还要政府发给卸车费……所以，当地有句顺口溜说：“扶不起的瑶山，填不满的坑。”从何帮助瑶胞脱贫致富？黄海认为：必须首先帮助他们改变封闭落后的传统观念。
    他从“族外通婚”上找到了突破口。瑶麓群众向来实行舅表婚，姑、妹之女必须嫁给舅舅的儿子，否则，要赔9头牛给舅舅；以后逐步改革，可以自由恋爱，不受财产限制，但占全乡瑶族总人口62％以上的覃（青裤瑶）、卢（白裤瑶）两大支族至今仍然不能通婚（更不能与其他外族通婚），给男女青年的婚嫁造成很大的困难，与外界的交往少得可怜，近亲结婚日趋严重。随着时代的变化，群众中也曾有人要求改掉这个旧俗。但又有人说：要打破这些旧观念，只有省、州领导才能解决。黄海引导大家学习民族学和人口学，全乡人民代表大会围绕覃、卢以至完全实现“族外通婚”问题进行了热烈的讨论。黄海和干部、寨老们的认识、主张得到了与会者一致的认可，并且形成了决议。按照瑶族习惯：立碑为凭，子孙照办。这就是“求留后记”碑的来历。这件事得到了覃、卢两姓瑶胞以及全县瑶胞的欢迎。立碑那天，本乡以及近临两乡的瑶族群众都来参加了隆重的立碑典礼。从此以后，覃、卢两支瑶族以及瑶族与其他民族通婚便合法化，而且在瑶乡逐渐形成了风气。到今年初，瑶麓瑶胞青年与外族通婚的已有16人，其中与汉族通婚的11对，与水族通婚的4对，覃、卢两支族间通婚的1对。
    我们谈着走着。所到之处都是一片欢快、繁忙的景象——乡幼儿园的娃娃，在瑶族阿姨带领下歌舞嬉戏；民族中小学书声琅琅；田野上到处都是欢声笑语。
