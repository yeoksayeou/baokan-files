Education is the foundation of the entire society's development, and teacher education is the foundation of the foundation. In the wave of educational reform in many countries, teacher education is the first to be impacted. From the current situation, the main trends of reform are as follows:

Reforming the Teacher Education System to Improve the Quality of Teacher Education

According to the traditional teacher education system in various countries, primary school teachers are trained by secondary teacher training schools, and secondary school teachers are trained by higher teacher training schools. Today, this old system has been broken through, and the training of primary and secondary school teachers has been raised to a new level.

Before World War II, the Soviet Union and Sweden trained the vast majority of primary school teachers through secondary teacher training schools, and secondary school teachers through higher teacher training schools. By the 1970s, the training of primary and secondary school teachers in countries like the Soviet Union and Sweden gradually transitioned to being completed by higher education institutions. Secondary school teachers need to undergo graduate education at higher teacher training colleges or universities. According to statistics, due to the reform of the teacher education system, the proportion of primary and secondary school teachers with higher education in the Soviet Union has been increasing year by year, reaching 94.6% in 1980. Sweden is recognized worldwide as the country with the highest level of primary and secondary school teachers. From the educational background of its public school teachers, 72% of primary school teachers have obtained a bachelor's degree, and 28% have obtained a master's or doctoral degree; 56% of secondary school teachers have obtained a bachelor's degree, and 44% have obtained a master's or doctoral degree. For many years, countries like the Soviet Union and Sweden have insisted on improving the quality of teacher education as the center, seeking to improve professional status with high quality and high standards, and seeking to improve social status with superior professional status. Their teacher education reforms have become a model for international teacher education reforms today.

Strengthening Teacher Quality and Emphasizing In-Service Teacher Training

In-service teacher training and continuing education are important components of modern teacher education systems and a continuation of the teacher education stage. Some countries' educational circles believe that with the rapid development of modern science and the increasing frequency of educational reforms, it is particularly important for teachers to update their knowledge through in-service training or continuing education.

Currently, some countries have institutionalized in-service teacher training and continuing education through legislation. For example, Japan's "Special Law for Educational Civil Servants" stipulates that "educational personnel must continuously conduct teaching research and participate in in-service training or continuing education to fulfill their duties." The Soviet Union's Ministry of Education clearly stipulates that "primary and secondary school teachers must undergo off-site training every five years, and each school must send at least 20% of its teachers to participate in various forms of training or continuing education activities each year." To encourage in-service teachers to actively participate in training or continuing education, many countries have taken corresponding measures to ensure that in-service teacher training or continuing education is conducted smoothly and effectively. In this regard, East Germany is particularly notable. East Germany implements various reward systems to attract in-service teachers to participate in training or continuing education.

Ensuring Teacher Quality and Strictly Implementing Recruitment Regulations

Some countries face the challenge of ensuring the quality of the existing teacher workforce during the reform and development of teacher education. To this end, an increasing number of countries have strictly regulated teacher qualifications through legislation, advocating that "just as lawyers and doctors need a license to practice, anyone who wants to be a teacher should obtain a teaching qualification certificate." Teachers must have received higher education and passed assessments and probation to obtain a qualification certificate before they can teach. For example, the Soviet Union's "Teacher Qualification Certificate," Japan's "Teacher Qualification Permit," North Korea's "Teacher Recognition Certificate," and Singapore's "Teacher Qualification Assessment Certificate" all clearly stipulate the requirements for teacher qualifications. Some countries are also gradually raising the requirements for teacher qualifications. To adapt to the grand goal of "educating Japanese people for the 21st century," Japan has formulated the "New Teacher Appointment System," deciding to reform the levels of teacher appointments and raise the standards for teacher appointments; stipulating that teachers not only need to be proficient in professional knowledge but also need to be familiar with educational theories, possess the ability to guide students, and have a sense of responsibility for the education cause; and stipulating that a comprehensive examination of primary and secondary school teachers be conducted every three years, including knowledge and skills, workload and attitude, professional training and continuing education. After the examination, outstanding individuals will be rewarded and promoted, while those who are unqualified will be dismissed or transferred within two months after the evaluation.

It is worth noting that an increasing number of countries have gradually stopped issuing lifetime teaching qualification certificates or permits, tending to issue short-term or temporary teaching qualification certificates or permits, aiming to enable teachers to update their knowledge and skills through returning to education and continuing education, adapting to the requirements of social changes.

    外国师范教育改革动向
    余逸群
    教育是整个社会发展的基础工程，师范教育又是基础的基础。在许多国家教育改革的大潮中，首先受到冲击的是师范教育。从当前的情况来看，改革动向主要表现在下列几个方面：
    改革师范教育体制，提高对师范教育质量的要求
    按各国传统的师范教育体制，小学教师由中等师范学校培养，中学教师由高等师范学校培养。今天，这种旧体制已被突破，中小学师资培养已提高到新层次。
    苏联、瑞典在二次世界大战前，绝大多数小学师资是由中等师范学校来培养的，中学师资是由高等师范学校来培养的。到了70年代，苏联、瑞典等国的中小学师资的培养工作逐渐过渡到由高等院校来完成，中学师资需经过高等师范院校或大学的研究生教育。据统计，苏联由于师范教育体制的改革，中小学教师中受过高等教育的比重逐年增加，1980年达94.6％。瑞典是世界公认的中小学师资水平最高的国家。从其公立学校教师的学历水平来看，在小学教师中取得学士学位者占72％，取得硕士或博士学位者占28％；中学教师中取得学士学位者占56％，取得硕士或博士学位者占44％。苏联、瑞典等国多年来坚持以提高师范教育质量为中心，以高质量、高标准求专业地位的提高，又以专业地位的优越求社会地位的提高，他们的师范教育改革已成为当今国际师范教育改革的典范。
    强化教师素质，重视在职教师培训
    在职教师的进修和培训工作是现代师范教育体系中的重要组成部分和师范教育阶段的延续。一些国家的教育界认为，现代科学发展日新月异，各国的教育改革日趋频繁，因此，教师进修或培训以加快知识更新就显得特别重要。
    目前，一些国家通过立法的形式，使在职教师的进修和培训工作形成制度化。如，日本制定的《教育公务员特别法》，其中规定“教职人员为尽其职责，必须不断进行教学研究和参加在职培训或进修”。苏联教育部明文规定，“中小学教师每隔5年必须轮流脱产培训一次，每所学校每年要派出不少于20％的教师参加各种形式的培训或进修活动。”为了鼓励在职教师积极参加培训或进修，很多国家均采取了相应措施，确保在职教师培训或进修工作顺利而有成效地进行。在这方面比较突出的是民主德国。民德实施多种奖励制度，吸引在职教师参加培训或进修。
    确保教师质量，严格制定录用制度
    一些国家在改革和发展师范教育的过程中遇到的困难是如何确保现行师资队伍的质量。为此，越来越多的国家通过立法严格规定教师的资格，他们主张：“正如律师和医生的合格证书一样，凡要当教师者都应取得执教的合格证书。”教师必须受过高等教育并经过考核、试用取得合格证书后，方可任教。诸如：苏联的《教师合格证书》、日本的《教师资格许可证书》、朝鲜的《教师认可证》、新加坡的《教师资格评审证》等，都明确规定了对教师资格的要求。有些国家还逐步提高对教师资格的要求。为适应“为21世纪而教育日本人”的宏伟目标，日本制定了《新的教师任命制度》，决定改革教师任命的等级，提高教师任命的标准；规定教师不但要精通专业知识，还要谙熟教育理论，具备指导学生的能力和对教育事业的责任感；还规定每3年对中小学教师进行一次全面检查，检查包括知识与能力、工作量与态度、业务培训与进修等情况。检查后，对优秀者给予奖励和晋级，对不称职者在评定后的两个月内，予以免职或调离工作。
    值得注意的是，越来越多的国家已逐步停止发放终身教师合格证或许可证，倾向于发放短期的或临时的教师合格证或许可证，旨在使教师通过回归教育、继续教育来更新知识与技能，适应社会变革的要求。
