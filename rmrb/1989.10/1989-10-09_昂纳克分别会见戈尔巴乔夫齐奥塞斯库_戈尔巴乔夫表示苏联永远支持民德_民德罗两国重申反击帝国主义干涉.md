East German leader Honecker reiterated on October 7 that the German Democratic Republic will continue to pursue a policy that unifies economic development with the improvement of people's lives, and that unifies continuity with innovation.

According to the DPA, Honecker held a private meeting with Soviet leader Gorbachev, who was invited to participate in the 40th-anniversary celebrations of the German Democratic Republic. During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on domestic, bilateral, and international situations.

After the private meeting, Honecker, along with other members of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held a meeting with Gorbachev and the Soviet delegation led by him. During the meeting, the leaders of both countries highly praised the traditional friendship between Germany and the Soviet Union and emphasized the importance of further comprehensive development of friendly relations.

Honecker believed that the construction of developed socialism in the German Democratic Republic itself is a profound political, economic, and social transformation process. Honecker stated that the German Democratic Republic remains committed to the fundamental stance of socialism. The attempt by bourgeois politicians to suppress and eliminate socialism on German soil is doomed to fail. Honecker expressed support for Soviet reforms. He believed that the Soviet reforms are of decisive significance for strengthening the position of socialism and world peace.

During the meeting, Gorbachev introduced the political system reforms in the Soviet Union and the recent Central Committee plenary session on national issues.

When discussing the international situation, Gorbachev clearly stated that the Soviet Union will always support the German Democratic Republic.

Gorbachev arrived in Berlin on October 6 and returned to his country after attending the national day reception hosted by Honecker on the evening of October 7.

East German party and state leader Honecker met on October 7 in Berlin with Romanian Communist Party General Secretary and President Ceausescu, who was participating in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

According to reports, both sides emphasized in the talks that socialism should be continuously improved on the basis of Marxism-Leninism according to the specific conditions of each country. Each country has the right to follow its own socialist path. The leaders of both countries reaffirmed that imperialist interference in the internal affairs of socialist countries and the resulting instability of socialist countries must be resolutely resisted. Both sides also emphasized the urgency of strengthening the close unity between socialist countries, communist and workers' parties, and all progressive forces in the world.
