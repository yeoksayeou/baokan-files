Xinhua News Agency, Xining, October 16th - According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Xining, the county of Tongren in the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province has recently undergone preliminary acceptance by the Qinghai Provincial Electrification Committee and has reached the national standard for rural electrification, becoming the first electrified county on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

Tongren County is a multi-ethnic residential area with a weak economic foundation and is listed as one of the poorest counties in the country. Therefore, the county has adopted a strategy of developing small hydropower to revitalize the local economy. With the strong support of the provincial water resources department, three hydroelectric power stations and a power grid have been built successively along the Longmu River that runs through the entire county, with a total installed capacity of 5925 kilowatts. Twelve out of the 13 townships in Tongren County now have electricity.

    青藏高原有了电气化县
    据新华社西宁10月16日电　（记者孙宁海　胡西生）青海省黄南藏族自治州同仁县，日前经青海省电气化管委会初步验收，已达到国家农村电气化规定标准，成为青藏高原第一个电气化县。
    同仁县是多民族聚居区，经济基础薄弱，被列为全国的贫困县之一。为此，这个县确定了发展小水电以振兴地方经济的战略。在省水利部门的大力支持下，相继在纵贯全县的隆务河上建起了3座水电站及供电网，总装机容量达5925千瓦。同仁县13个乡有12个通了电。
