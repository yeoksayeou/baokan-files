The national tax authorities have been diligently strengthening the collection of individual taxes, achieving notable results. According to statistics, from January to September this year, the country's individual tax revenue totaled 889.6 million yuan, an increase of 49.6% compared to the same period last year. In August, the revenue was 127.9 million yuan, and in September, it was 147.4 million yuan, representing increases of 92.1% and 93.4% respectively compared to the same months last year. The development momentum is quite good.

At the beginning of this year, the State Taxation Administration, in response to the widespread and serious issue of tax evasion among individual taxpayers, proposed to prioritize the strengthening of individual tax collection as a key task. They aimed to achieve breakthrough progress within the year. Tax officials, in collaboration with public security, procuratorial, judicial, and industrial and commercial departments, have taken a series of effective measures in enforcing tax laws and expanding tax law propaganda. Local governments at various levels have also paid significant attention to this work. Through inspections and rectifications, a large amount of back taxes have been recovered, and several major tax evaders with evaded taxes amounting to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions of yuan have been identified.

Based on the current situation, the State Taxation Administration predicts that the target of increasing individual tax revenue by 30 billion yuan on top of the 9 billion yuan collected last year, reaching 12 billion yuan, is achievable.

According to statistics from the tax authorities, by the end of September, the cumulative tax revenue from personal income adjustment tax nationwide was 406.33 million yuan, completing 135% of the annual plan and increasing by 4.46 times compared to the same period last year. In September alone, 91.35 million yuan in tax revenue was collected.

Looking at the collection situation across the country, Liaoning Province collected 43.93 million yuan in personal income adjustment tax, ranking first nationwide. Following are Guangdong with 36.58 million yuan, Jiangsu with 31.74 million yuan, and Hebei with 31.45 million yuan.

In terms of the percentage of annual plan completion, Yunnan ranks first nationwide, completing 312.5% of the annual plan; Hunan is second, completing 248%; Liaoning is third, completing 219.65%; and Heilongjiang is fourth, completing 213.75%.

    今年初，国家税务局针对个体税收偷漏普遍而严重的状况，提出要把加强对个体税收的征管作为一项重要任务认真抓好，力争在年内取得突破性的进展。广大税务干部和公安、检察、司法、工商等部门密切配合，在严肃税收法纪、扩大税法宣传等方面采取了一系列有力措施。各级地方政府也很重视这一工作。经过检查整顿，查补了大量税款，查出了不少偷漏税几万元、十几万元乃至几十万元的大户。
    根据目前的情况预测，国家税务局提出的今年个体税收收入在去年征收90亿元的基础上增加30亿元，达到120亿元的目标，是可以实现的。
