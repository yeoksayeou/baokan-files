Readers' Letters on "Yanhua" Campaign

"Live Yellow Books" Also Need to Be Controlled

In strengthening the management of the rural cultural market, people mainly focus on confiscating pornographic books and audiovisual products, while the storytelling market in the countryside is often overlooked. Some folk artists, known as "live yellow books," are still spreading spiritual poisons in some places by singing obscene stories and using vulgar language. To manage this "blind spot," our township cultural station has been supervising and managing folk artists who come to perform since July. First, we check their performance permits; second, we review the content of their stories; third, we monitor the performances on-site and address any issues immediately. In mid-August, a folk artist unilaterally altered the approved script and performed an obscene ancient story, which was of low taste. He was immediately expelled. Since then, no one has dared to perform "yellow books" in our area.

There Are Still "Blind Spots" Here

Pornographic Books Sold on 583/584 Trains

On September 4 and 5, I attended a meeting in Linfen and took the 583/584 train for the round trip. I saw that the train attendants were still pushing carts selling pornographic books. I checked, and out of the 8 books for sale, only "Youth and Health" was a healthy book. The rest contained obscene and violent content. I pointed to one book and asked the seller, "Aren't these types of books not allowed to be sold anymore?" The seller replied, "We only care about making money, not what kind of books we sell." This is quite unacceptable. I appeal to the relevant departments to manage this train market that ignores the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

Looking Forward to More Good Books

Currently, the "Yanhua" campaign is deepening across the country. Pornographic books and obscene products are being decisively destroyed, and some illegal publishing units are being shut down in accordance with the law, which has been met with applause from the people nationwide.

This "Yanhua" campaign has a new feature: it not only focuses on the campaign itself but also on promoting socialist cultural arts. I believe this is the fundamental solution to the problem. Looking back, there have been several "Yanhua" campaigns, but the more we clean up, the more "yellow" content seems to appear. The main reason is that we focus too much on suppression and too little on guidance. Because the human mind cannot be empty, if we do not fill it with something good, something bad will inevitably take its place. We have thoroughly cleaned up the "yellow" content, so we must provide people with "red," beautiful, healthy, and appealing things to absorb and enjoy.

I think that from now on, the whole society (not just the literary and artistic circles) should invest a lot of effort into promoting cultural arts. We should use things that the masses like and have vitality to occupy the socialist literary and artistic front, enriching people's spiritual lives.

The three letters raise two important issues in the "Yanhua" campaign. First is the cleaning of "blind spots." "Blind spots" are often places where filth accumulates and harmful elements breed. Therefore, to deepen the "Yanhua" campaign, special attention must be paid to cleaning those areas that are often overlooked but highly harmful, such as train book markets and artists who perform "yellow books." Appropriate management measures must be taken. Second is the issue of "destruction" and "construction." While eliminating "poisonous" products, more attractive "nutritious" products must be provided. If people's spiritual needs are not met, various kinds of "yellow" products will find their way in and resurface. Only by genuinely improving the supply of spiritual food can a healthy reading environment be created.

### 读者来信谈“扫黄”

　　读者来信谈“扫黄”
　　“活黄书”也要管住
    在加强农村文化市场管理时，人们把注意力主要放在查收黄色书刊和音像制品上，而乡村的说书市场却被忽视了，一些被称为“活黄书”的民间艺人仍在一些地方唱淫书说秽语散布精神毒品。为了管好这个“死角”，我乡文化站从7月起对来本地说书的民间艺人进行监督管理，一是检查说书证明，二是审定说书内容，三是到书场监听，发现问题及时处理。8月中旬，一位民间艺人擅自改动经审定的书目，说唱格调下流的古书，被当场赶走。从此，再也没有人敢到我们这里说唱“黄书”了。

    这里还有“死角”
　　583／584次车有人兜售不良书刊
    9月4日和5日，我到临汾开会，乘583／584次列车往返，见列车服务员依旧推着小车子在出售黄色书刊。我看了一下，所出售的8种书刊，只有《青春与健康》一种为内容健康的书，其余几种均有淫秽、凶杀等内容，我指着一本问售书者，现在不是不准出售这类书吗？售书者竟说，我们只管赚钱，不管卖什么书。这未免有些太不像话。呼吁有关部门管管这置党中央、国务院指示于不顾的列车市场。

　　盼望多出好书
    眼下，全国各地的“扫黄”工作正向纵深发展。黄色书刊和淫秽制品被坚决销毁，一些不法的出版单位被依法取缔，全国人民拍手称快。
    这次“扫黄”有一新特点，那就是一手抓“扫黄”，一手抓繁荣社会主义文化艺术。我认为，这才是解决问题的根本所在。回想过去，曾几度“扫黄”，然而越扫“黄”越多。究其原因，重堵轻导是原因之一。因为人的大脑不可能是空白地，这个不去占领它，那个必然钻进去。我们彻底清除了“黄”的，就得拿出“红”的、精美的、健康的、人们喜闻乐见的东西给人们，让人们高兴地吮吸其中养分。
    我以为，从现在起，全社会（不仅仅是文艺界）都应该花大气力去繁荣文化艺术，用群众喜闻乐见的、有生命力的东西去占领社会主义文艺阵地，以丰富人们的精神生活。

    三封来信提出了“扫黄”中值得注意的两个问题。一是清扫“死角”。“死角”往往是藏污纳垢、细菌滋生繁殖的祸源地。因此，要深入“扫黄”，就特别要注意清扫那些不为人们注意但又危害极大的“死角”，像对列车书市场、说“黄书”的艺人等，都要有相应的管理措施。二是“破”与“立”的问题。在清除“毒品”的同时要拿出更多吸引人的“营养品”来。人们精神上的需求得不到满足，各种各样的“黄货”就会乘虚而入，卷土重来，只有切实搞好精神食粮的供给，才能创造一个健康的阅读环境。
