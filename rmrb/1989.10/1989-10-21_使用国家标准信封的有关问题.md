	Issues Regarding the Use of National Standard Envelopes

	Question: Starting from July 1st this year, the postal service in Jiaozhou City, Shandong Province, has stipulated that all letters must be sent using envelopes produced under the supervision of the Jiaozhou City postal service, each costing 5 fen. Otherwise, the letters will be returned. Could you please explain the situation regarding the use of national standard envelopes?

	Answer: The national standard for envelopes was issued by the former State Bureau of Standards and has been in effect since November 1, 1987, nearly two years ago. The national standard for envelopes is mainly based on postal business operations, operational norms, and technical requirements, and also refers to the development trend of China's paper standards. The design of the envelope cover includes: postal code writing scanning area, fluorescent bar code identification area, stamp or postage affixing cancellation area, label affixing reading area, and address and name writing reading area for the recipient and sender (see the figure above). Currently, most provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government in China have issued notices to implement the national standard for envelopes and have made clear regulations on the sale and use period of non-standard envelopes. However, some regions have encountered difficulties in producing national standard envelopes due to changes in specifications and sizes during the implementation process. According to this, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision has issued relevant documents, which, under the principle of strictly implementing the national standard for envelopes, allow specialized factories producing civilian envelopes to temporarily produce and sell according to the original standard until January 1, 1992. Therefore, in regions where the implementation of the national standard for envelopes has not yet been issued, the relevant documents of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision should be followed, allowing national standard envelopes and original standard envelopes to coexist, and also allowing the sale and use of original standard civilian envelopes. However, for envelopes printed and used by various enterprises and institutions that also include the name of the unit, they must meet the specifications and size requirements of national standard envelopes.

	For commercial departments that have purchased and sold non-standard envelopes without knowing the situation, or for units that have printed and are still using non-standard envelopes, if there are still a large number of non-standard envelopes left after the sale and use period, they should promptly report to the local postal department, and then the local standard management department will work with the postal management department to decide on a solution.

	Envelopes are not a monopoly item of the postal service. Whether purchased from the market or self-made, as long as they meet the various specifications, sizes, and quality requirements of the national standard for envelopes, or non-standard envelopes are within the allowed use period, postal offices in various places should not refuse to accept and deliver them. Various units or individuals who wish to know the national standard for envelopes or reflect related matters can directly contact the local postal office or appeal to the postal management bureaus of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

　　使用国家标准信封的有关问题
    问：今年7月1日起，山东胶州市邮电局规定，寄信人都要使用胶州市邮电局监制的信封，每只5分。否则，信就会被退回。请问：关于使用国家标准信封到底是怎么回事？
      山东胶州市　伊　群
    答：信封国家标准是原国家标准局颁布，于1987年11月1日起实施，至今已近两年。信封国家标准主要依据邮政业务、作业规范和技术要求，并参照我国纸张标准的发展趋向而制定的。信封的封面设计有：邮政编码书写扫描区、荧光条码标识区、邮票或邮资粘贴盖销区、标签粘贴识读区、收信人和寄信人地址、名称的书写识读区等（见上图）。目前，我国大多数省、自治区、直辖市已下达了执行信封国家标准的通知，并对非标准信封的销售和使用期作了明确规定。但也有部分地区在实施过程中，一些生产民用信封的专业厂反映，因规格尺寸的变化，生产国家标准信封有困难。据此，国家技术监督局下发了有关文件，在强调信封国家标准必须贯彻执行的原则下，同意供应市场销售的民用信封专业生产厂，暂可按原标准生产和销售，截止期是1992年1月1日。为此，在尚未下发执行信封国家标准的地区，应按国家技术监督局的有关文件执行，允许国家标准信封与原标准信封并存，也允许原标准的民用信封的销售和使用。但是，对各企事业印制和使用的并印有单位名称的信封，必须符合国家标准信封的规格尺寸要求。
    对一时确不知而采购和销售非标准信封的商业部门，或已印制和仍在使用非标准信封的单位，在超过销售和使用期后，仍有大批非标准信封积压，应及时向当地邮政部门申报，再由当地标准主管部门会同邮政主管部门决策解决。
    信封系非邮政专营商品，无论是从市场购买或自制的，凡符合信封国家标准的各项规格尺寸和质量要求，或非标准信封在允许的使用期内，各地邮局均不得拒绝收寄和投递。各单位或个人欲知信封国家标准及反映有关事项，均可直接向当地邮局联系，或向各省、自治区、直辖市邮电管理局申诉。
