At the request of the State Council, the State Education Commission recently, together with the Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and relevant ministries and commissions, dispatched personnel to supervise and inspect the primary and secondary school education work in the provinces and autonomous regions of Jilin, Shanxi, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Hubei.

The supervision and inspection team observed in various places that over the past decade, China's basic education has made significant progress and presented a new appearance. Various levels of party and government leaders generally place more emphasis on education than in the past. Due to the broad opening of financial channels and increased social investment in education, the conditions for running schools in various places have significantly improved. Various places have also taken some effective measures to stop the dropout of primary and secondary school students and to curb arbitrary fees, achieving noticeable results.

Through this supervision and inspection, there is a clearer understanding of the problems existing in basic education. The main issues currently are: First, moral education in primary and secondary schools needs to be further strengthened, especially in implementing education on the Four Cardinal Principles, patriotism, labor, and hard work. Rural schools should emphasize education on loving one's hometown and being determined to build one's hometown. Second, the proportion of public funds in educational funds is generally decreasing year by year and is seriously insufficient, which urgently needs effective measures to solve. Third, some places need to speed up the renovation of dilapidated school buildings; teaching instruments, equipment, books, and sports and cultural supplies are generally lacking and need to be replenished. Fourth, the treatment of teachers, especially medical care and housing conditions, needs to be further improved; the local self-raised portion of the treatment of private teachers in some places needs to be further implemented. Fifth, the work to stop the dropout of primary and secondary school students needs to be strengthened.

According to the deployment of the State Council, in the second half of this year, three batches will be organized to supervise and inspect the primary and secondary school education work in 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, excluding Tibet. This is the first batch, and the second batch departed on October 18th.

　　八省区教育工作督导检查结果表明
　　基础教育获得很大发展
　　仍有一些问题亟待解决
    据新华社北京10月20日电  （记者朱维新）受国务院的委托，国家教委最近会同全国人大常委会教科文卫委员会和有关部委，派出人员，对吉林、山西、青海、黑龙江、辽宁、甘肃、新疆、湖北8个省、区的中小学教育工作督导检查。
    督导检查组在各地看到，十年来我国基础教育工作有了很大发展，呈现出新的面貌。各级党政领导普遍比过去更加重视教育。由于广开财路，增加社会对教育的投入，各地中小学的办学条件有了明显改善。各地在制止中小学生流失和乱收费方面也采取了一些有效措施，并取得明显效果。
    通过这次督导检查，对基础教育中存在的问题有了更清醒的认识。当前的主要问题是：一，中小学德育工作还要进一步加强，尤其是坚持四项基本原则教育、爱国主义教育、劳动教育和艰苦奋斗教育需要进一步落实。广大农村学校还要强调加强热爱家乡、立志建设家乡的教育。二，公用经费占教育经费的比例普遍逐年下降、严重不足的问题，亟需采取有效措施加以解决。三，有的地方校舍危房的改造工作还要抓紧进行；教学仪器、设备、图书和文体用品普遍缺乏，还需充实。四，教师待遇特别是医疗、住房条件还需要进一步改善；有的地方民办教师待遇中的地方自筹部分要进一步落实。五，制止中小学生流失工作还应加强。
    根据国务院的部署，今年下半年将分三批对除西藏以外的29个省、自治区、直辖市的中小学教育工作进行督导检查。这次是第一批，第二批已于10月18日出发。
