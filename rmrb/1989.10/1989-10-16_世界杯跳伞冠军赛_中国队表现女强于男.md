The fifth World Cup Parachuting Championship's precision jumping event concluded its fifth round today. The Soviet men's and women's teams, participating for the first time, are currently leading the scores. Chinese athletes have shown a trend of women excelling and men lagging behind.

Among the 12 female athletes, Soviet athlete Felinkova Nadezhda and China's Lai Xiaoli both landed on the bullseye in all five rounds, temporarily tying for first place. Soviet athlete Lipkina Olga, with a total distance of 0.01 meters from the bullseye, is temporarily in third place. Another Chinese athlete, Zhang Hongyan, with 0.04 meters, is temporarily in fourth place.

Among the 16 male athletes, Soviet athletes also performed exceptionally well. Lanskov Sergei landed on the bullseye in all five rounds, temporarily leading the rankings. East German athlete Jens U. Laschotta is just 0.01 meters behind, temporarily in second place. Soviet athlete Fedorov Vladimir, with 0.03 meters, is temporarily in third place. China's Yang Yi, with 0.07 meters, is temporarily in seventh place. Today, Chen Hong performed well, landing on the bullseye twice in three rounds and just 0.01 meters off in one round. However, due to his poor performance in yesterday's two rounds, with a total of 0.33 meters, he is temporarily in 12th place, and his chances of winning the championship are slim.

    世界杯跳伞冠军赛
    中国队表现女强于男
    本报成都10月15日电　记者罗茂城报道：第五届世界杯跳伞冠军赛定点跳伞今天已赛完5轮，首次参加世界杯冠军赛的苏联男女队成绩暂时领先。中国运动员出现女佳男次现象。
    在12名女运动员中，苏联的费琳克娃·娜苔佳和中国的赖晓莉5次均踩中靶心，暂时并列第一。苏联的莉普基娜·奥尔戈以离靶心0.01米的总成绩暂居第3。中国的另一名女运动员张红雁以0.04米暂居第4。
    在16名男运动员中，苏联运动员也表现出色，兰斯科夫·塞尔吉5次踩中靶心，暂列榜首。民主德国的詹斯·乌·拉少塔仅以0.01米之差暂居第2。苏联的费多罗夫·弗拉基米尔以0.03米暂居第3。中国的杨翼以0.07米暂居第7。中国的陈宏今天发挥较好，在3轮比赛中两次踩中靶心，一次仅偏离0.01米；但由于他昨天两轮比赛中水准失常，以0.33米暂居第12，夺冠希望渺茫。
