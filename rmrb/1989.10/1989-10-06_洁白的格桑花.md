Comrade Buqun, when we parted in Naqu, you promised me that the next time you came to Beijing to visit, you would bring a bouquet of my favorite Gsang flowers from the northern Tibetan plateau to my home. Five years have passed, and you still haven't come. Have you forgotten?

I remember in the summer of 1982, when I bid farewell to the Qingtang Grassland, you accompanied me to the Naqu Bridge. We looked at each other with tears in our eyes for a long time before finally letting go of each other's hands. When you choked out "Dachayin" (Tibetan for "goodbye") in a low voice, my heart was shattered.

The car had already driven far away, but you were still standing on the bridge, gazing at us until our car disappeared into the vast Qingtang Grassland. In the spring of 1988, when I returned to Naqu for a visit, I learned that you had been taken by the evil disease of cancer. That parting at the bridge had become our final farewell, alas! I wiped away my tears and ran to the Naqu River Bridge, placing a pure white Gsang flower there to express my deep longing.

I will never forget that the first time I came to Hongqi Township was in the spring after the Gang of Four was smashed. You taught me how to ride a horse and saddle it with your own hands. You said, "The horse is the main means of transportation in our pastoral area. If you can't ride a horse, you won't be able to go anywhere." You patiently guided me until I could ride freely across the Qingtang Grassland. After the horse racing festival, we participated in the great battle to build the grass library together.

That month, I learned from you how to eat tsampa with my hands, make butter tea, and roast mutton over a cow dung fire. Life on the grassland was truly full of wild charm and romance!

The most unforgettable days were during the criticism of the Gang of Four. As the deputy secretary of the township party branch in charge of propaganda and education, you and our work team from the prefecture committee spent countless sleepless nights together!

You poured all your love and hatred into every step you took across the Qingtang Grassland.

Once, we were trapped in a mountain valley by a sudden blizzard for an entire day. The temperature dropped to minus 40 degrees Celsius. The wind whipped the snowflakes against our faces like knives, and the thin air made it hard to breathe. Both people and horses were cold and hungry. You took off your lambskin coat and draped it over my shivering body. Immediately, a warm current surged through my heart; but you were tortured by the blizzard for three days...

Comrade Buqun, in your busy schedule, you taught me Tibetan language and script. Although your Chinese was not fluent at the time, you were so enthusiastic, serious, and meticulous. From pronunciation to writing, you were meticulous. When I first spoke Tibetan to you, you were so excited. Oh, yes, on that very night, I suffered from food poisoning and was vomiting and unconscious all night. It was you who sent someone to the prefecture committee to deliver the message and stayed by my bedside with Comrade Losang and Uncle Wujin...

I have not forgotten all of this. Every memory is like a pure white Gsang flower blooming in my heart.

The years I spent fighting alongside you in Hongqi Township are truly unforgettable. Who would have thought that you would leave so suddenly and never return? Your open-mindedness, enthusiasm, and integrity are like the Gsang flowers that bloom proudly in the snow on the Qingtang Grassland, forever blooming in my heart.

    洁白的格桑花
    柳长靖
    布琼书记，那曲分手时，你答应我，下次去北京参观，一定带上一束我最喜欢的藏北格桑花，来我家做客。5年过去了，你也没有来。难道你忘了吗？
    记得1982年仲夏，我告别羌塘草原那天，你一直送到那曲大桥边，我们泪眼相觑许久，才松开紧握的手。当你哽咽而低沉地说出“达蔡仁（藏语：再见。）”时，我的心简直碎了。
    车已开出很远，你还站在桥头凝望着，直到我们的车消失在辽阔的羌塘草原……1988年孟春，我探亲重返那曲时才知道：你已被万恶的病魔夺去了生命。当年大桥分手，竟成了生死诀别，悲夫！我揩干泪水，一口气跑到那曲河桥边，放上一朵洁白的格桑花，以寄托我深深的思念……
    我不会忘记，最早来到红旗乡时，是粉碎“四人帮”后的第一个春天。你手把手地教我骑马、备鞍。你说，马是咱牧区的主要交通工具，不会骑马将寸步难行。你耐心地指导我，直到我跃马自如地奔驰在羌塘草原。赛马节过后，我们一同参加了围草库伦的大会战。
    这一个月，我跟你学会了手抓糌粑、打酥油茶、在牛粪火上烤羊肉，草原生活真是野趣横生、浪漫极了！
    最难忘的是批判“四人帮”的日子里，你作为分管宣传教育的乡党支部副书记，和我们地委工作组熬过了多少不眠之夜！
    你把强烈的爱和憎全部凝集在踏遍羌塘草原的每一行脚印中。
    一次，我们在山谷中被突如其来的暴风雪困了整整一天。气温降至零下40多度。风卷着雪片疯狂地抽打着我们的脸，如刀割一般，加上高原氧气稀薄，连呼吸都很困难，人和马都饥寒交迫。你脱下了羔皮氆氇袄披在了我冻得发抖的身上。顿时，一股暖流涌上心头；而你，却被暴风雪折磨得躺了3天……
    布琼书记，你在百忙之中教我学藏语、藏文。尽管当时你的汉语还讲得不流利，却是那样热情、严肃、认真。从字母发音到书写，皆一丝不苟。当我第一次用藏语跟你会话时，你是那样的激动。哦，对了，就在这天晚上，我因食物中毒上吐下泻，昏迷不醒，折腾了一夜，是你亲自派人去地委送信，并和洛桑书记、乌金阿爸一直守在我的床前……
    这一切，我都没有忘却，件件往事如纯洁的格桑花开在我的心田。
    在红旗乡与你共同战斗的岁月真让我留恋。谁料，你竟这样匆匆离去，不再复返。而你的襟怀坦荡、热情正直，就像那雪中傲放的格桑花，永远盛开在羌塘草原……
