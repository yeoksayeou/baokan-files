Saudi King Appeals to Hoss and Aoun for Joint Stance to Resolve Lebanese Crisis

	Taif Lebanese Parliament Meeting Still in Deadlock

	Tunis, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Saudi Press Agency, Saudi King Fahd sent letters to Lebanese Acting Prime Minister Hoss and Military Government Chief Aoun, urging them to adopt a joint stance to resolve the Lebanese crisis.

	Fahd hopes Hoss and Aoun will adopt a joint stance to work with all parties and relevant sides in Lebanon, based on the opinions of the Casablanca Arab Summit and the resolutions of the Arab Three-Party Committee, to resolve the Lebanese crisis.

	Fahd pointed out that the Arab Three-Party Committee believes that the highest interest of Lebanon is the highest goal of the Taif Conference, to maintain Lebanon's unity and ensure its security and stability.

	Damascus, Oct. 10 (Our Correspondent Lü Zhixing) - Saudi King Fahd, at the conclusion of the Saudi Cabinet meeting yesterday, stressed that Lebanese parliamentarians should unite in their understanding and determine Lebanon's future based on the principles of maintaining Lebanon's unity and independence. He pointed out that a broad discussion of the issues, a cautious attitude towards the situation, and a detailed analysis are all manifestations of the parliamentarians' sincere intention to implement the resolutions of the Arab Three-Party Committee.

	King Fahd made these remarks as the Taif Conference has yet to yield results. Since September 30, Lebanese parliamentarians from two factions have been meeting in Taif, Saudi Arabia, to discuss the "Lebanese National Reconciliation Plan" issued by the Arab Three-Party Committee. There are significant disagreements between the two sides on issues such as restricting the president's powers, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon, and Lebanese-Syrian relations. After more than 10 days of debates and off-site consultations, the differences between the two sides have not been bridged. Leaders of the Arab Three-Party Committee have frequently met with the two factions of parliamentarians and, through relevant countries, have worked with the two Lebanese factions to achieve an agreement that both sides can accept, aiming to avoid the failure of the Taif Conference.

	Arab countries and the international community are closely watching the outcome of the conference that will determine Lebanon's future.

    沙特国王分别致函胡斯和奥恩
    呼吁采取共同立场解决黎巴嫩危机
    塔伊夫黎巴嫩议会会议仍陷于僵局
    据新华社突尼斯10月8日电　据沙特阿拉伯通讯社援引沙特负责人的消息报道，沙特国王法赫德昨天分别致函黎巴嫩代总理胡斯和军政府首脑奥恩，呼吁他们为解决黎巴嫩危机采取共同的立场。
    法赫德希望胡斯和奥恩采取共同的立场，以便根据卡萨布兰卡阿拉伯首脑会议的意见和阿盟三方委员会的决议，在同黎巴嫩各方和各有关方面的合作下解决黎巴嫩危机。
    法赫德指出，阿拉伯三方委员会认为，黎巴嫩的最高利益是塔伊夫会议最高的目标，以便维护黎巴嫩的统一和确保黎巴嫩的安全与稳定。
    本报大马士革10月10日电 记者吕志星报道：沙特国王法赫德在昨天结束的沙特内阁会议上强调，黎巴嫩议员们应统一认识，依据维护黎巴嫩的统一和独立的原则确定黎巴嫩的前途。他指出，对问题进行广泛的讨论，对形势采取谨慎的立场和细致的分析是议员们对为贯彻阿盟三方委员会的决议充满真诚意愿的表现。
    法赫德国王是在塔伊夫会议至今仍未取得结果而讲这番话的。自9月30日起，黎巴嫩两派议员在沙特的塔伊夫召开会议，就阿盟三方委员会发表的“黎全国和解计划”进行讨论，双方对计划中有关限制总统权限，叙利亚军队在黎的存在和黎—叙关系等问题有较大分歧。10多天来，经过会上争论和会下磋商，双方分歧仍未弥合，阿盟三方委员会领导人同两派议员频繁接触，并通过有关国家做黎两派的工作，以期取得一项双方都能接受的协议草案，避免塔伊夫会议的失败。
    阿拉伯国家和国际社会都在密切注视着决定黎巴嫩前途的会议结果。
