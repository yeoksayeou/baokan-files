Recently, a folk song and dance troupe performed in a certain county town. Outside the theater, a large, colorful poster was hung, featuring a pair of unseemly couplets. I will reproduce them here: “Love songs stir romantic thoughts, endlessly enjoyable, with endless aftertaste; vigorous dances are powerful and crisp, full of vigor on stage, stimulating and flavorful.” The characters are bold and striking.

Upon seeing this couplet, one can't help but appreciate its peculiarity. “Stirring romantic thoughts” and “stimulating and flavorful,” the implications of these vulgar words are not hard to understand. The designer of the poster uses such language to attract audiences, but in reality, it does not win the favor of the audience. In today's era of developing commodity economy, posters are everywhere, colorful and diverse. A good poster not only has concise and beautiful language, a fresh and artistic design that can attract audiences, but also has healthy content and elegant taste, which can cultivate one's character and is beneficial to the construction of spiritual civilization. As much as possible, achieving a perfect unity of content and form is also the goal that every poster designer should pursue.

The theater is a place of civilization and should promote civilization. As a frontline and window for the construction of civilization, poster advertisements should pay more attention to civilization.

### 海报宣传应讲文明

    海报宣传应讲文明
    最近，有一个民间歌舞团到某县城演出，剧场门口挂出一幅大型彩色画面的海报，海报上书有一副不象样的对联，笔者不妨抄录于此：“情歌撩逗情思，百听不厌，回味无穷；劲舞刚劲利落，满台豪爽，刺激够味。”字迹赫然醒目。
    奇联共欣赏。“撩逗情思”、“刺激够味”，这些浅俗词语的含意令人不难理解。海报的设计者以此来招徕观众，其实并不受观众的青睐。在商品经济不断发展的今天，海报可谓琳琅满目，五彩缤纷。一幅好的海报，不仅文简辞美，画面新颖，具有艺术性，能吸引观众，而且要内容健康，格调高雅，能陶冶人的性情，有利于精神文明建设。尽量做到内容和形式的完美统一，这也是每个海报设计者应追求的目标。
    剧场是文明场所，应讲文明。作为文明建设的阵地和窗口，海报宣传更应讲究文明。
