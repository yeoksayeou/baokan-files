In the early days of New China, when bags of white fertilizer arrived in the countryside, some farmers were astonished and asked, "Do crops eat 'salt' too?" When the "putt-putt" sound of tractors entered the village, some old farmers were puzzled, "What is this?" But today's farmers are not only familiar with fertilizer and tractors; they also speak fluently about hybrid rice, compound fertilizer, plastic film, compound feed, and "Dichlorvos" and the like. In just forty years, China's traditional agriculture, with its thousands of years of history, has undergone—

A Silent Revolution

Forty years ago, Chinese agriculture still followed the ancient and laborious practices of our ancestors: plowing with wooden plows and hoes; harvesting with sickles. The crops grown in the fields and the livestock raised at home were either local varieties or old breeds. There was no electricity, no farm machinery, and hardly any fertilizer or pesticides. People worked from sunrise to sunset. Millions of farmers toiled in the fields, facing the earth and turning their backs to the sky, working hard all year to produce only about 70 kilograms of grain per mu (a unit of area). Millions of women spent the year raising chickens and pigs, yet the national average was only one egg every half month and one kilogram of meat every three months. The production level of China's agriculture, with its long history, was indeed very low by the standards of the 20th century.

It is not entirely accurate to attribute China's low agricultural productivity solely to feudal land relations. Throughout Chinese history, farmers had many opportunities to redistribute land and wealth, but these efforts never led to a stable, significant increase in agricultural productivity. Today, it is clear that the backward production conditions and methods, as well as the lack of modern scientific and technological nutrition, were also significant factors. In the early days of liberation, Chinese agriculture was still stuck in the dream of traditional agriculture that had lasted for thousands of years, with hardly any taste of the progress of modern science and technology.

In the past forty years, Chinese agriculture has turned a new page in history. In 1988, the national grain production reached 394.08 million tons, and cotton production reached 4.15 million tons, increasing 2.5 times and 8.3 times respectively compared to 1949; pork, beef, and mutton production reached 21.94 million tons, and aquatic products reached 10.61 million tons, increasing 9 times and 23 times respectively; the total agricultural output value, calculated on a comparable basis, increased 5.1 times in 40 years, with an average annual increase of 4.8%. In 1957, China's production of cotton, rapeseed, peanuts, meat, and other products ranked second in the world, and grain production ranked third in the world; now they all rank first in the world. It is entirely reasonable to say that China is now the world's leading agricultural and animal husbandry country. All of this cannot be separated from the large-scale promotion and application of modern science and technology. It can be said that the progress of modern science and technology is fundamentally changing the image of China's agriculture.

The "old farmers" all remember that in 1950, a severe rust epidemic swept through the country, causing a loss of 6 billion kilograms of wheat. At that time, people were anxious to see the spreading plague, but they were helpless. Chinese farmers had been tormented by such plagues for thousands of years and could only rely on fate. But who would have thought that by 1965, China's agricultural scientists had basically controlled the spread of wheat rust.

There are countless such examples. The history of New China's agricultural development records the immortal achievements of agricultural scientists.

Over the past 40 years, China's grain crops have undergone 3 to 6 varieties of replacement, each time increasing production by about 10%. Between 1949 and 1985, more than 3,400 varieties of 40-plus crops were bred and used in production nationwide. In particular, the breeding of rice, which accounts for about one-third of China's total grain production, has achieved two major breakthroughs that have attracted worldwide attention: In 1959, China bred the first high-yielding, fertilizer-tolerant, lodging-resistant dwarf rice variety "Guangchang Dwarf," followed by "Zhenzhu Dwarf," "Guanglu 9," and more than 50 other dwarf varieties, increasing rice yield by 100 kilograms per mu. In the 1970s, China bred hybrid rice, further increasing the yield by about 50 kilograms per mu, and became China's first agricultural patent exported to the United States in the 1980s, attracting great attention from the international agricultural community.

Along with the promotion of improved varieties, new agricultural production methods have gradually been perfected and promoted. In 1957, the amount of chemical fertilizer used per mu in China was 0.2 kilograms, the amount of electricity used was 0.1 kilowatt-hours, and the area of mechanized farming was only 2.4% of the total cultivated area; by 1988, these indicators had increased to 14.8 kilograms, 49.3 kilowatt-hours, and 42.5% respectively. Integrated pest management and new cultivation technologies have continuously emerged and improved. The plastic film covering cultivation technology, praised by farmers in impoverished and food-deficient areas as the "poverty alleviation project," was promoted from 1982 to 1987, covering 114 million mu, increasing production value by 6.7 billion yuan, and increasing the yield of some major crops by 20% to 50%, with some even reaching 100%. In recent years, plastic film technology has been developing in the livestock industry, with great potential for increased production.

In addition, achievements such as the control of wheat rust, the eradication of the East Asian locust, the breeding of Chinese Merino sheep, the factory-based breeding and cultivation technology of shrimp, and the technology of moving rubber northward not only lead the world in academic research but also have produced enormous social and economic benefits. According to statistics from the National Science Conference in 1978, 3,137 agricultural science and technology achievements were made, of which 20 reached or approached the world's advanced level. In the subsequent period from 1979 to 1988, 76 agricultural research achievements won the National Invention Award, 5 won the National Natural Science Award, and 130 won the National Technology Promotion Award. After 40 years of effort, a complete agricultural science and technology promotion system and a four-tier agricultural education system, including higher education, secondary education, various levels of cadre education, and farmer technical training, have been initially formed nationwide.

Of course, scientific and technological progress is not a cost-free endeavor, especially for a large traditional industry like agriculture, which requires a large-scale technological transformation and a large amount of investment. China's achievements in agricultural technological transformation and the national policy of investing in agriculture as the foundation are inseparable. According to statistics, from 1950 to 1987, the national financial allocation for agriculture was approximately 293.8 billion yuan, accounting for 10.3% of the total financial expenditure. With this money, a large number of flood control, drainage, irrigation, and power generation projects were completed, and a complete agricultural machinery, fertilizer, pesticide, and agricultural plastic industry system, combining large, medium, and small enterprises, was established. In 1988, the total agricultural machinery power nationwide was 265.8 billion watts, an increase of 219 times compared to 1957; large and medium-sized tractors totaled 870,000 units, an increase of 57 times; the amount of chemical fertilizer used in agriculture reached 21.42 million tons, an increase of 56 times. It can be said that China's agriculture has embarked on a path of continuous development relying on scientific and technological progress.

Scientific and technological progress not only effectively supported the stable development of China's agriculture over the past 40 years but, more importantly, it has shown a broad prospect for development.

A certain research institution recently, in a report titled "Systematic Study on Several Problems of China's Long-Term Rural Development," analyzed the resource prospects of China's long-term agricultural development and reached a very pessimistic conclusion, stating that "China's total natural resources are abundant, but the per capita share is small, lower than the world average and continuing to decline"; "China's agricultural resources have good rain and heat conditions, but the water and engineering matching is poor, the quality is not high, and it shows a clear downward trend"; "For a long period, China is in a state of heavy population burden, approaching the carrying capacity limit and may exceed it." But even this report confidently declares: "Scientific and technological progress is the hope to break through the population and resource contradiction." At the same time, another unit's report is titled "Relying on scientific and technological progress is the fundamental way to solve China's food problem."

As early as the initial period of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," with the approval of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the agricultural department proposed to accelerate the promotion of new varieties, crop model cultivation, and 10 other agricultural technologies. Each technology contains enormous potential for high yield. The deputy director of the Science and Technology Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Zhu Baoxin, said: "If we fully promote the hundreds of existing grain varieties, China's total grain production would not be 400 billion kilograms but could be 650 billion kilograms."

The potential of scientific and technological progress also lies in the fact that China's current level of agricultural science and technology is still quite low. Experts estimate that China's current irrigation water, chemical fertilizer, and agricultural machinery are still far from sufficient in quantity, but the effective utilization rate of the existing irrigation water is only 30% to 40%, the effective utilization rate of chemical fertilizer is only 30%, and the effective utilization rate of agricultural machinery is only 20%. It is estimated that if the method of applying chemical fertilizer is made more scientific, increasing the utilization rate from the current 30% to 40%, it would be equivalent to applying an additional 10 million tons of chemical fertilizer nationwide, which could increase grain production by more than 15 billion kilograms, and farmers would save more than 2 billion yuan in production costs. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Finance began implementing the "Harvest Plan" in 1987, focusing on the promotion of applicable advanced technologies. In the past two years, 42 advanced technologies have been arranged, increasing grain production by 4.8 billion kilograms, cotton by 96.09 million kilograms, livestock products by 73.51 million kilograms, aquatic products by 64.19 million kilograms, and economic benefits of nearly 4.7 billion yuan. However, relevant departments are deeply concerned about the lack of funds. They believe that the current annual investment by the state for this purpose is only a few hundred million yuan, and if there were more, many more things could be done.

The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences' Institute of Agricultural Economics estimates that from 1978 to 1984, 35% of the increase in China's agricultural production value was achieved through agricultural scientific and technological progress. In some foreign countries with developed agriculture, this figure has reached 60% to 80%. The gap and potential are obvious. By the end of this century, it is entirely possible for China to reach 50%. Every agricultural worker interviewed by the reporter is full of confidence in the development of agriculture through science and technology.

专栏：庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年

    新中国建立初期，当白花花的化肥送到乡下时，有农民惊奇地问：庄稼也吃“盐”？当“突突”的拖拉机开进村时，有老农不解：这是啥？可是，今天的农民，不仅熟悉了化肥、拖拉机，还满口杂交稻、复合肥、地膜、配合饲料、“敌杀死”之类的词儿。短短四十年，有数千年悠久历史的中国传统农业经历了——
    一场静悄悄的革命
    本报记者　陈健
    （一）
    40年前的中国农业，仍沿袭着几千年祖辈们的古朴和辛劳：耕种，用的是木犁、锄头；收割，舞的是镰刀。地里种的作物，家里养的畜禽，不是地方土种就是陈年老种。没有电，没有农机，也没什么化肥和农药。日出而作，日落而息。亿万农夫脸朝黄土背朝天，辛苦一年，平均每亩地也不过打出70公斤左右的粮食，亿万农妇在家一年到头养鸡养猪，可全国人均每半个月才能吃1个鸡蛋，每3个月才能吃1公斤肉。有悠久历史的中国农业那时的生产水平，用20世纪的标准来衡量，实在是太低了。
    仅仅把中国农业的低生产率归于封建的土地关系是不全面的。中国历史上农民曾有过很多次均贫富、分田地的机会，可都未能促成农业生产率稳定持久地大幅度提高。今天看来，农业生产条件和手段的落后，缺乏现代科技文明的营养也是一个重要原因。解放初期的中国农业仍沉睡在几千年传统农业的迷梦中，几乎没有尝到现代科技进步的甜头。
    近40年，中国农业掀开了历史的新一页。1988年，全国粮食产量达39408万吨，棉花产量达415万吨，分别比1949年增长2.5倍和8.3倍；猪牛羊肉产量达2194万吨，水产品达1061万吨，分别增长9倍和23倍；按可比口径计算，农业总产值40年增长5.1倍，平均每年增长4.8％。1957年，我国棉花、油菜籽、花生、肉类等产量居世界第二位，谷物产量居世界第3位；现均居世界第一位。完全有理由说，我国现在是世界上首屈一指的种养殖业大国。这一切都不能不归功于现代科技的大规模推广应用。可以说，现代科技进步正在根本上改变着我国农业的形象。
    （二）
    “老农业”们都记得，1950年，一场锈病大流行，全国损失小麦60亿公斤。那时，人们看着蔓延的瘟神心急如焚，可就是束手无策。中国农民被这类瘟神折腾了几千年，还是只能听天由命。可谁也没想到，到1965年，我国的农业科技工作者们就基本上控制了小麦锈病的流行。
    这类事例举不胜举。新中国的农业发展史上，记载着农业科技工作者们的不朽功勋。
    40年来，我国的粮食作物已进行了3—6次品种更换，每次更换，都使产量增长10％左右。仅1949年—1985年间，全国40多种作物共育成并用于生产的品种就有3400多个。尤其是占我国粮食总产1／3左右的水稻育种，更取得了举世瞩目的两大突破：1959年我国育成了第一个高产耐肥抗倒的矮秆籼稻良种“广场矮”，此后又相继育出“珍珠矮”、“广陆9”等50多个矮秆良种，使水稻单产提高100公斤。70年代，我国又育成籼型杂交水稻，又使单产提高了50公斤左右，并成为80年代我国第一个输往美国的农业专利，引起国际农业界极大重视。
    与良种的普及推广相应，新型农业生产方法也逐渐完善推广起来。1957年，我国每亩地施用化肥量为0.2公斤，用电量为0.1千瓦小时，机耕面积仅占耕地总面积的2.4％；到1988年，上述指标分别发展为14.8公斤、49.3千瓦小时和42.5％。病虫害综合防治技术、新型栽培技术不断出现和完善。被贫困缺粮地区农民誉为“温饱工程”的地膜覆盖栽培技术，从1982年到1987年共推广1.14亿亩，共增加产值67亿元，一些主要农作物的增产幅度在20％—50％，高的甚至达100％。近年来，塑料薄膜技术正向养殖业发展，增产潜力很大。
      此外，小麦锈病的控制、东亚飞蝗的根治、中国美利奴羊的培育、对虾工厂化育苗和养殖技术、橡胶北移种植技术等科技成果，不但在学术上居世界领先地位，而且产生了巨大的社会效益和经济效益。据1978年全国科学大会统计，取得农业科技成果3137项，其中有20项接近或达到世界先进水平。而后的1979年—1988年，农业科研成果获国家发明奖的有76项，获国家自然科学奖的有5项，获国家技术推广奖的有130项。经过40年的努力，全国已初步形成完整的农业科研推广体系和高等教育、中等教育、各级干部教育和农民技术培训等四级农业教育体系。
      当然，科技进步也不是不花钱的事业，尤其是像农业这种庞大的传统产业，要进行大规模的技术改造必须进行大量的投资。我国农业技术变革的成就和国家以农业为基础的投资政策是分不开的。据统计，1950年—1987年间，国家财政拨付的支农资金约2938亿元，占财政总支出的10.3％。用这些钱，建成了大量的防洪、排涝、灌溉、发电等工程措施，建立了大中小相结合、门类比较齐全的农业机械、化肥、农药和农用塑料等农用工业体系。1988年，全国拥有农业机械总动力2658亿瓦，比1957年增长219倍，大中型拖拉机87万台，增长57倍；农用化肥施用量达2142万吨，增长56倍。可以说，我国农业已走上了一条依靠科技进步不断发展的康庄大道。
    （三）
    科技进步，不仅有效支撑了我国40年农业稳定发展，更重要的是展示了广阔的发展前景。　　某研究机关最近在一份题为“关于中国农村长期发展几个问题的系统研究”中，对中国农业长期发展的资源前景分析得出了很不乐观的结论，认为“我国自然资源总量多，但人均占有量少，低于世界平均水平，且在不断下降”；“我国农业资源雨热条件好，但水工匹配欠佳，质量不高，并呈明显下降趋势”；“相当长时期内，我国处于人口负荷过重的临界状态，并有可能超过承载极限。”但就是这份报告也颇有信心地宣称：“科技进步是突破人口与资源矛盾僵局的希望所在”。与此同期，另一单位一份报告题目就是“依靠科技进步是解决中国食物问题的根本途径”。
    早在“七五”计划初期，经党中央和国务院批准，农业部门就提出加速推广新品种、农作物模式栽培等10项农业技术。每项技术都蕴藏着巨大丰产潜力。农业部科技司副司长朱宝馨说：“仅仅把现有的几百个谷物良种全面推广开来，我国粮食总产就不是4000亿公斤而可能是6500亿公斤。”
    科技进步的潜力还在于我国农业现在的科技水平还相当低。行家们估计，我国目前灌溉用水、化肥和农用机械在量上仍很不足，但现有灌溉水的有效利用率仅30％—40％，化肥的有效利用率仅30％，农机的有效利用率仅20％。据测算，如果只是把施用化肥办法变得更科学些，使利用率从目前的30％提高到40％，就相当于全国增施化肥1000多万吨，可多增产粮食150多亿公斤，农民也少花20多亿元生产成本。农业部和财政部从1987年开始实施以推广适用先进技术为主的“丰收计划”，两年来共安排42项先进技术，增产粮食48亿公斤，皮棉9609万公斤，畜产品7351万公斤、水产品6419万公斤，经济效益近47亿元。可是有关部门却深为资金不充足而忧虑。他们认为，现在国家每年为此投入的资金仅几千万元，若再多一点，还可以办很多事情。
    中国农科院农经所在测算农业科技进步的作用时认为，1978年—1984年我国农业生产的增值中，有35％是靠农业科技进步取得的。而国外一些农业发达的国家已达到60％—80％。差距和潜力都是明显的。到本世纪末，我国的这个比值达到50％是完全可能的。接受记者采访的每一个农业工作者，都无一例外地对科技兴农充满了信心。
