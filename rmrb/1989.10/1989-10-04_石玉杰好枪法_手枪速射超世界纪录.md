Chinese athlete Shi Yujie today set a new world record in the men's handgun speed shooting event at the sixth Pyongyang International Shooting Competition held here. Shi Yujie scored 596 rings, surpassing the world record for this event.

In the qualification round of the men's handgun speed shooting event, Shi Yujie hit 296 rings with his first 30 shots and scored 10 rings with each of his next 30 shots, totaling 596 rings. This score surpassed the world record of 594 rings set by East German athlete Schuman in early June of this year by two rings. However, Shi Yujie's performance in the semifinals and finals was not ideal, and he ultimately finished in second place with a total of 878 rings. His teammate Meng Gang won the first place with a score of 880 rings.
