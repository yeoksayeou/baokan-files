Everyone knows
It is your brilliant birthday
This day—you have reached 40 years
I sing for you, New China,
You have given us light and hope…

40 years of glorious years
You have relied on your own strength
Built the country with thrift
Transformed a semi-colonial sick man of East Asia
Into a world power with widespread technology
Look,
From the Greater Khingan Range to the north and south of the Tian Shan Mountains
From the Khorchin Grassland to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
How much change has occurred on our beautiful land
Oil fields rising from the desert
One new oil city after another
Symbolize the bright future of our natural gas and oil
And drive the construction of large-scale petrochemical industrial zones
You have carefully drawn a new steel wall for our country
With annual production of several thousand tons of steel
The aviation, shipbuilding, and automobile industries have taken off and been realized
In the past 40 years, you have opened thousands of coal and metal mines for us
Completed one dam and power station after another
Under the dual drive of coal and electricity
Industrial modernization has developed strongly and rapidly
The once barren lands
Marshes, tidal flats, barren hills, sandy lands, and wastelands
Have gradually become the base for our grain, oil, silk, and tea
The treatment of the Huai River, the diversion of the Yellow River, and the Luan River into Tianjin
You not only stand firm in China
But also look to the world
Established sparkling economic special zones along the coast
Built large new seaports
Swallowing and transporting goods and guests…

If your eyes could see clearly and penetrate the clouds
You would surely be delighted to see
More than 20 bright new stars in the sky
Those are the Long March series rockets, the world-shaking masterpieces of China
A merchant from the Taklamakan Desert told me:
“I often see strange, giant mushroom-shaped clouds in the northwest sky…”
That is our scientists testing the hydrogen bomb
Let us solemnly declare to the people of the world:
“The Chinese people have stood up!”
Countless are your labors for the Chinese nation
Infinite are your great changes for the country’s construction
40 years of socialist New China—
You tightly hold the hands of all ethnic groups
Together we march towards
A more prosperous, stronger, and more beautiful tomorrow…

    我的祖国
    潘维疆
    人人都知道
    是你灿烂的生日
    这一天——你度过了40周岁
    我为你歌唱，新中国，
    你赐与我们光明和希望……
    40年光辉岁月
    你自力更生
    勤俭建国
    把一个半殖民地东亚病夫
    变为科技普及的世界强国
    看
    从大兴安岭到天山南北
    从科尔沁草原到青藏高原
    我国锦绣山河上产生多大的变化
    沙漠中崛起的油田
    一个个崭新的石油城市
    象征了我国天然气石油广阔远景
    还带动了大规模石化工业区域的兴建
    你精心勾画出我国新的钢铁长城
    有了年产几千万吨钢铁
    飞机船舰汽车工业起飞得到了实现
    40年来你为我们
    开了千百个煤炭金属矿区
    完成了一个又一个水坝和发电站
    煤和电双重推动下
    工业现代化开展得又强又快
    过去一片片荒废的土地
    沼泽滩涂荒山沙地丘陵荒原
    如今已逐渐形成为我国粮油丝茶的基地
    治淮疏黄引滦入津
    你不但立足中华
    还放眼世界
    沿海开办了晶晶闪闪的经济特区
    建设了大规模新的海港
    吞吐货物运送佳宾……
    如你眼睛能明察秋毫透视浮云
    你一定惊喜看到
    天空中多了20余颗明亮新星
    那是我国长征系列火箭威震世界杰作
    一位塔克拉玛干沙漠中的驼商对我说：
    “我经常看到西北上空
    奇异巨型菇状云昙……”
    那是我国科学家正在试爆氢弹
    让我们庄严向全世界人民说
    “中国人民从此站起来了”
    数不尽你为中华民族的辛劳
    说不完你为祖国建设的巨大转变
    40年的社会主义新中国啊——
    你紧紧牵着各民族的手
    大家一起走向
    更富裕更强大更美好的明天……
