Dalian Seals Off Vacant Homes of Leading Cadres
Local Residents Praise the Move as Genuine

Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, October 20 (Correspondent Wang Yonghai, Reporter Li Xiaolin) Dalian City is seriously rectifying the improper practices in housing allocation. So far, 27 vacant rooms owned by 14 county-level and above leading cadres have been sealed off and confiscated.

Since August this year, Dalian City has uncovered more than 400 vacant rooms of various kinds. The Dalian Municipal Government has decided that for the "vacant rooms" occupied by leading cadres, one will be sealed off and confiscated for each one discovered, without any leniency. One county-level cadre already has three rooms but still applied for a spacious new residence, leaving the three rooms for his daughter to live in. This time, after the inspection, the real estate department has already confiscated and sealed off his newly applied residence.

Dalian City's action has caused a strong reaction in society. Currently, more than 50 party members and cadres in the city have voluntarily handed over their "vacant rooms." Residents praise, saying, "This time, the city is really taking action to rectify the improper practices in housing allocation. We are full of confidence in this rectification."

　　大连查封领导干部空闲住房
　　当地群众称赞此举动了真的
    新华社大连10月20日电　（通讯员王永海、记者李小林）大连市认真纠正住房不正之风，目前已有14名县团级以上领导干部的27间空闲房屋被查封充公。
    从今年8月起，大连市先后查出各类闲房400多间。大连市政府决定，对领导干部占有的“闲房”，要查出一处，充公一处，决不手软。有一位县团级干部已有三间房子，但他又要了一处宽敞的住房，把三间房子给女儿居住，这次查出后，房产部门已将他新要的住房没收充公。
    大连市的这一行动，在社会上引起了强烈的震动。目前，全市已有50多名党员干部主动交出了“闲房”。群众称赞说，这次查封“闲房”，市里确实是动真的、来实的，我们对纠正住房不正之风充满信心。
