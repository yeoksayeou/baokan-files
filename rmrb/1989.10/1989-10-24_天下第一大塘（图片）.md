The world's largest pond, Anfeng Pond, is located in Shouxian County, Anhui Province. The pond covers an area of 34 square kilometers with a circumference of 26 kilometers. The pond's embankment is protected with rough stones and lined with weeping willows. Numerous water gates stand along the embankment. Anfeng Pond, originally known as Shaobei, was constructed during the Spring and Autumn Period, approximately 2,500 years ago. It was built under the supervision of Sun Shuo, the prime minister of the State of Chu. Before the liberation, it only irrigated 80,000 mu of farmland. After the founding of New China, the construction of the Tunxi-Hangbu Irrigation District began, transforming it into a regulating reservoir with a capacity of 100 million cubic meters of water. The water supply is abundant, irrigating 670,000 mu of farmland around the pond. Boats travel back and forth on the pond, and fishermen sing in the evening. Outside the pond, canals crisscross, and the land is lush with grain. It presents a prosperous scene. The honorary chairman of the United Nations Dam Committee and Dutch dam expert Toran once visited Anfeng Pond and exclaimed, "This is the oldest pond in the world, the largest pond in the world." The accompanying photo shows the scenic view of Anfeng Pond under the moonlight.

　　天下第一大塘
    安丰塘位于安徽省寿县境内，塘面积34平方公里，塘周长26公里，塘坝用毛石护坡，绿柳垂荫，水闸林立。安丰塘古名芍陂，它兴建于春秋时代，距今约2500余年，是楚国令尹孙叔敖主持兴建的，直到解放前夕灌田仅8万亩。新中国成立后，兴建了淠史杭灌区，它成为一个反调节水库，蓄水1亿立方米，水源充足，可灌溉四周农田67万亩，塘面舟船来往，渔歌晚唱，塘外沟渠纵横，水丰粮满，一派欣欣向荣的景象。联合国大坝名誉主席、荷兰大坝专家托兰曾来安丰塘参观，赞叹道：“这是世界上最古老的塘，世界上最大的塘。”图为安丰塘月下的景色。　田准　摄影报道
