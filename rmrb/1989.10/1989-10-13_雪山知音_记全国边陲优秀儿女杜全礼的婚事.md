The setting sun took away the last golden glow from the Muztagh Ata Peak. The bright lights from the clubhouse of the Red Flag Lafu Border Defense Station in Xinjiang shone through the windows, casting a glow on the snowy landscape. Du Quanli, an exemplary youth from the frontier, was holding his wedding ceremony here.

"Next, please have the bride and groom share their love story."

The groom, Border Defense Station's Intelligence Officer Du Quanli, spoke confidently: "Our love story began with a matrimonial advertisement."

In October 1982, Du Quanli enlisted from a farm and pastoral collective in Xinjiang and was assigned to the military region's infantry school's intelligence unit after a year. During his studies, he was introduced to a female teacher from the same collective. The young woman, seeing that the young man was handsome and talented in both literary and martial arts, decisively said, "I will definitely wait for you."

After graduating from military school, Du Quanli volunteered to serve as an intelligence officer at the Pamir Border Defense Station. Upon arriving at the border station, he wrote a letter to the young woman, explaining the honorable duties of a border defense soldier and describing the magical scenery of the snowy plateau, filling ten pages. He thought the young woman would encourage him, but instead, he received a cold and final ultimatum: "If you still want to maintain our love, then transfer to a unit closer to home or be discharged. Otherwise, we'll have to say 'goodbye'!"

Reading this letter of misunderstanding and coldness, Du Quanli felt furious. He tore the letter into pieces.

Time flies. In the blink of an eye, two years had passed. Little Du had achieved outstanding border defense results and was awarded the Third-Class Meritorious Service Medal twice. He was also awarded the "National Frontier Exemplary Youth" silver medal. During his home leave, some well-meaning people had introduced him to several young women, but they shook their heads upon learning that he was a highland soldier. One day, he flipped through a magazine and saw the "Magpie Bridge" column, which gave him an idea: "Why not give it a try?" After dinner, he called several officers from the border station together, and they quickly composed an advertisement: "Du Quanli, an officer at a certain border defense station on the Pamir Plateau, is 28 years old, 1.76 meters tall, handsome, sincere, and dedicated to his career, aiming to achieve great things on the border. Seeking a companion who is of similar age, height, and interests, and understands border defense soldiers."

Du Quanli lit a cigarette, patted his wife beside him, and changed his tone: "To find out what happened next, please listen to the bride's explanation."

Amidst the enthusiastic applause, the bride stood up shyly. Her name is Chen Lin, a worker at the Xinjiang No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill. Without hesitation, she continued her husband's words: "It was early last year when I saw Quanli's matrimonial advertisement in 'Xinjiang Youth.' At that time, I thought a lot. Since childhood, I have admired heroes, and as I grew up, I still respect soldiers, especially border defense soldiers. Without you guarding the mountains and rivers of our motherland, how could there be stability in the country and peace for the people? Of course, I also understand that having a lifelong relationship with a border defense soldier requires not only courage but also the spirit of self-sacrifice. During courtship, one cannot enjoy the sweetness of being together under the moonlight, and after marriage, one must endure emotional torment and heavy household chores. But I am willing to live in a life of 'dedication' that is understood."

The wedding ended, and snowflakes were still falling outside the window. The dim candlelight added warmth to the newlyweds' room. A couple dedicated to the border defense began their new life in the snow-capped sentinel post.

    雪山知音
    ——记全国边陲优秀儿女杜全礼的婚事
    杨功成
    夕阳收走了慕士塔格峰最后一抹金色余辉。新疆红旗拉甫边防站俱乐部里明亮的灯光透过窗户，洒在皑皑的冰雪上。边陲优秀儿女杜全礼正在这里举行婚礼。
    “下一个节目，请新郎新娘介绍恋爱经过。”
    新郎，边防站机要参谋杜全礼落落大方地说：“我们的恋爱，是从征婚广告开始的。”
    一九八二年十月，杜全礼从新疆一家农牧团场应征入伍，一年后考入军区步校机要队。学习期间，经人介绍，他与本团场一位女教师相识。姑娘见小伙子长得英俊潇洒，文武双全，明朗而坚决地说：“我一定等着你。”
    军校毕业后，杜全礼主动请求到帕米尔边防当了一名机要参谋。一到边防站，他就给姑娘写信，从讲解边防军人的光荣职责，到介绍风雪高原的神奇风光，满满十页。他原以为姑娘会鼓励他，不料得到的却是一纸令人心寒的最后“通牒”：“如果你还想维系咱们之间的爱情关系，那就调到离家近的部队，或者转业。否则，咱俩只好‘拜拜’！”
    读着这封不被理解的绝情信，杜全礼心里好气哟！他把这封信撕得粉碎。
    光阴似箭。转眼两年过去了，小杜以出色的戍边战绩，先后两次荣立三等功，还被挂上了“全国边陲优秀儿女”银质奖章。回乡探亲时，一些热心人也曾给他介绍过几位妙龄女郎，但对方听说他是高原大兵，便连连摇头。一天，他翻开一本杂志，一眼瞥见其中“鹊桥”专栏，不由得心头一动：“我何妨不去试试呢？”晚饭后，他把边防站几位干部叫到一起，大家你一言，我一语，很快凑成了一则“广告”：“杜全礼，帕米尔高原某边防站军官，年方二十八岁，身高一点七六米，品貌端正，待人诚实，且忠于事业，志在边防建功立业。欲找年龄相近、身高相当、志趣相合、能理解边防军人的姑娘为伴。”
    讲到这里，杜全礼点上一支烟，拍了拍身旁的妻子，语调一变：“欲知后事如何，请听新娘解说。”
    在热烈的掌声中，新娘含羞地站了起来。她叫陈琳，是新疆七一棉纺织厂的工人。她不加思索地接过了丈夫的话茬：“那是去年初，我从《新疆青年》上看到全礼的征婚广告。当时，我想了很多。我从小崇拜英雄，长大后仍然敬仰军人，尤其是边防军人。没有你们守卫着祖国的山山水水，哪能有国家的稳定、人民的安宁？当然，我也懂得，与边防军人结百年之好，不仅需要勇气，还必须具有自我牺牲的精神。恋爱时享受不了花前月下的甜蜜，结婚后需要承受感情煎熬和繁重家务。但我情愿生活在被理解的‘奉献’中。”“第二天，我给全礼写了一封信。信的末尾，我特意引了这样一句诗：莫愁雪山无知音，天下自有识君人！”婚礼结束了，窗外仍飘着雪花，淡淡的烛光给新婚的洞房增添了融融暖意。一对志在边防的新人在雪山哨所开始了新的生活。
