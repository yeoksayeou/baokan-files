Title: Opinion on a Scene from the Film "The Founding Ceremony"

	Editor:

	The revolutionary historical film "The Founding Ceremony" has a scene from the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee: Comrade Mao Zedong is speaking on the stage, with Comrades Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai seated on either side of him. This does not align with the actual historical situation and is a mistake.

	The Seventh National Congress of the Party was held in Yan'an from April to June 1945. At the time, the five leaders—Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Ren Bishi—were seated on the front of the stage. They were members of the Seventh Congress Presidium and were later elected as members of the Politburo and the Secretariat of the Central Committee at the First Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Ren Bishi was also elected as the Secretary-General of the Party Central Committee. This strong collective leadership, formed through long-term revolutionary practice, was wholeheartedly supported by the entire Party, the entire army, and all ethnic groups across the country. The key reason for the success of the Chinese Revolution was the existence of such a united Party Central Committee leadership.

	The Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee was held from March 5 to 13, 1949, in Xibapo, Ping Mountain County (then known as Jianping County), Hebei Province. The Presidium members of the plenary session were proposed by Mao Zedong and unanimously approved by the plenary session. They were Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Ren Bishi. According to the film records at the time, Mao Zedong spoke from behind a table at the front center of the venue, while the other comrades spoke from the front center table of the venue. After speaking, they all sat down below. Zhu De sometimes sat behind a table to the side of the venue, and sometimes sat below.

	As a historical film, it can be artistically processed and improved based on historical facts, but it should not, like the scene of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee in the film "The Founding Ceremony," show only Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai sitting above, while Ren Bishi sits below, because there was no such scene in history. The scene "created" in the film "The Founding Ceremony" easily gives viewers who are not familiar with the historical facts the wrong impression that the Party Central Committee leadership at the time consisted of four people (Mao, Zhu, Liu, Zhou), rather than five people (Mao, Zhu, Liu, Zhou, Ren), which can lead to negative political consequences. I hope that in the future, when filming such themes, the original historical facts must be respected.

	Reply:

	People's Daily Mass Work Department:

	Your department forwarded the opinion of Comrade Yuanyuan regarding the film "The Founding Ceremony," which we have received. After consulting with the Changchun Film Studio, we understand that the situation reflected by Comrade Yuanyuan is accurate. During the filming of this movie, Changchun Film Studio had reviewed relevant materials and photographs of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee. Comrade Ren Bishi mostly sat below the stage of the venue, and sometimes sat on the stage. They filmed the scene where he sits below the stage, but throughout the entire film, there are still quite a few scenes featuring Comrade Ren Bishi.

	Given that the film "The Founding Ceremony" has already been released nationwide, it is not possible to make changes to the scene at this time.

### 对影片《开国大典》一个镜头的意见

　　对影片《开国大典》一个镜头的意见
　　编辑同志：
    革命历史题材影片《开国大典》，有一个七届二中全会的镜头：毛泽东同志在主席台上讲话时，朱德、刘少奇和周恩来3位领导人分别就座毛泽东两边，这同当年实际情况不符，是个失误。
    党的七大是1945年4月到6月在延安召开的。当时在大会主席台正面就座的是毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来、任弼时5位领导人。他们是七大主席团成员，后来在七届一中全会上又同时被选为政治局委员、中央书记处书记，任弼时还当选为党中央秘书长。这个在长期革命实践中形成的坚强集体领导核心得到了全党、全军和全国各族人民的衷心拥护。中国革命之所以取得最后成功，关键原因是有了这么一个团结一致的党中央领导核心。
    七届二中全会于1949年3月5日至13日在河北省平山县（当时叫建屏县）西柏坡召开，全会主席团成员是经毛泽东提议、全会一致正式通过的，他们是毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来、任弼时。根据当时纪录的电影资料，毛泽东发言时是在会场前面正中的桌子后，其他同志发言时，站到会场前面正中的桌子旁，发言以后都坐在下面。朱德有时坐在会场前面旁边的桌子后，有时坐在下面。
    作为历史题材的影片，可以在忠于历史事实的前提下进行艺术加工和提高，但决不应该像影片《开国大典》中所拍摄的七届二中全会的那样，只有毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来坐在上面，而任弼时坐在下面，因为历史上没有这样的场面。影片《开国大典》“创作”出的这个镜头，容易给不了解历史真相的观众造成错觉，以为当时党中央领导核心是4个人（毛、朱、刘、周），而不是5个人（毛、朱、刘、周、任），从而产生不好的政治后果。希望今后拍摄这类题材的影片时，必须尊重历史本来面目。　北京　远远

　　人民日报群众工作部：
    你部转来远远同志对影片《开国大典》的意见收悉。经我们向长春电影制片厂了解，他们认为远远同志反映的情况是属实的。长影在拍摄这一影片时，曾查阅过有关七届二中全会的资料和照片，任弼时同志多数是坐在会场的主席台下，有时也坐在主席台上。他们拍成现在影片中坐在主席台下的镜头，但在整个影片中，任弼时同志的镜头还是比较多的。
    鉴于目前影片《开国大典》已在全国上映，来不及再对镜头进行修改。
