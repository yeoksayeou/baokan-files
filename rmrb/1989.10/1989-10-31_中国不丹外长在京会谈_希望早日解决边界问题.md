Chinese and Bhutanese foreign ministers expressed hope today for an early resolution to the border issues between the two countries.

Bhutan's Foreign Minister Dasho Tshering Tashi arrived in China yesterday to lead the sixth round of Sino-Bhutanese border talks. Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuxiang welcomed the delegation at the airport.

This afternoon, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with Tshering Tashi at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in a friendly atmosphere.

Tshering Tashi first expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and people for the warm welcome and friendly reception extended to the Bhutanese delegation. During the talks, both sides introduced their respective domestic and foreign policies.

Qian Qichen warmly welcomed Tshering Tashi's first visit to China to participate in the Sino-Bhutanese border talks and reviewed the development of relations between the two countries. He said that although China and Bhutan have not established diplomatic relations, their relationship has always been friendly. The Chinese people cherish the traditional friendship between China and Bhutan and attach great importance to developing friendly relations with Bhutan, respecting Bhutan's independence and sovereignty.

He reiterated that the Chinese government is willing to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; strengthening solidarity and cooperation with Third World countries is the cornerstone of China's foreign policy.

Qian Qichen said that China sincerely hopes, on the basis of the agreement reached last year on the guiding principles for resolving the Sino-Bhutanese border issue, to resolve the border issue as soon as possible, so that the future border between the two countries will be a peaceful and friendly border, a bond of friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

Tshering Tashi agreed that countries should develop relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He believed that peace and disarmament are very important because without peace, economic development is not possible. Tshering Tashi also expressed the hope for an early resolution to the border issue between the two countries.

At noon, Qian Qichen hosted a banquet at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse to welcome Tshering Tashi and his delegation.
