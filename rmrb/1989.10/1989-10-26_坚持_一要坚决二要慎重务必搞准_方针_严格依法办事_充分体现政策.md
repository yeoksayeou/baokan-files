Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th.

Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin said today that in implementing the notice from the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, both leniency and severity must be applied according to the law, and the notice's provisions must be fully reflected in policy. Leniency within the law is not unlimited leniency.

He said that during the notice period, courts at all levels have applied the notice's provisions to handle cases leniently in the following general situations: (1) Those who surrender themselves and turn over all illicit gains will be given a lighter sentence according to the law. (2) Those who surrender themselves, actively return illicit gains, and have meritorious service can be given a reduced sentence or exempted from punishment according to the law. (3) For those who have been subjected to compulsory measures or are in custody awaiting trial and voluntarily confess all crimes or remaining crimes, sincerely repent, actively return illicit gains, or expose and report crimes, they will be given lenient treatment according to the law based on different circumstances.

Ren Jianxin said that for those who stubbornly resist, refuse to confess, hide crimes, transfer illicit gains or destroy evidence, or collude with each other to form a defense alliance, or flee to avoid legal punishment, they will be severely punished. Those who deserve the death penalty will be sentenced to death, and those who deserve heavy sentences will be given heavy sentences. During the notice period, the Supreme People's Court has tried a number of serious economic crime cases according to the law, and for those with particularly serious circumstances who should be sentenced to death according to the law, the death penalty has been approved. These approved death penalty cases mainly include the following situations: (1) After the crime was discovered, they did not confess but continued to commit crimes. (2) They hid their crimes, fled to avoid legal punishment. (3) They squandered the illicit gains, causing significant losses to the state.

Ren Jianxin said that in applying the notice to try economic crime cases, courts at all levels have adhered to the policy of "being decisive, cautious, and accurate," always insisting on clarifying the facts and solidifying the evidence. They have also paid attention to investigating the circumstances of the crime, the return of illicit gains, and meritorious service, to ensure the quality of the cases. This prevents mistaking non-mitigating or reducing circumstances as mitigating or reducing sentences, or mistaking false surrenders and false confessions as lenient treatment. At the same time, it also prevents cases that should be leniently treated according to the law from not being treated leniently.

He said that while promoting and implementing the notice, courts at all levels have timely selected a number of typical cases of surrenders, confessions, exposures, and meritorious service that were leniently sentenced, as well as cases of refusal to confess that were severely sentenced, and publicly tried them. From August 15th to October 15th, courts at all levels held 1,044 public trial sessions, trying 2,614 typical leniency and severity cases. Among them, there were 576 cases of embezzlement, 283 cases of bribery, and 53 cases of speculation. A total of 4,320 criminals were sentenced, with 772 given lenient sentences and 287 given severe sentences. Of those given lenient sentences, 351 were given lighter sentences, 251 were given reduced sentences, and 170 were exempted from criminal punishment. Due to the fulfillment of the policy, the notice's appeal and deterrent effect were greatly enhanced, expanding the social impact of the cases and effectively encouraging criminals to surrender and confess. For example, after the Intermediate People's Court of Dan Dong City, Liaoning Province, held a policy fulfillment trial session on September 8th, the number of surrenders increased more than doubled in less than four days.

### 坚持“一要坚决二要慎重务必搞准”方针  严格依法办事　充分体现政策

　　坚持“一要坚决二要慎重务必搞准”方针
　　严格依法办事　充分体现政策
    新华社北京10月25日电　最高人民法院院长任建新今天说，在贯彻高法、高检《通告》中，从宽从严都要依照法律，并按照《通告》的规定，充分体现政策。从宽是在法律范围内的从宽，不是宽大无边。
    他说，《通告》期间，各级法院适用《通告》规定从宽处理的案件，一般有以下几种情况：（1）投案自首，并交出全部赃款的，依法从轻处罚。（2）既投案自首，积极退赃，又有立功表现的，依法可以减轻处罚或者免除处罚。（3）对于已被采取强制措施或者在押未决人犯能主动坦白交代全部罪行或者余罪，真诚悔罪，积极退赃或检举立功的，根据不同情节，依法也予以从宽处理。
    任建新说，对于那些负隅顽抗、拒不交代、隐瞒犯罪、转移赃款赃物或者毁灭证据，或者互相串供，订立攻守同盟，或者畏罪潜逃，企图逃避法律制裁的犯罪分子，则坚决从严惩处，罪该判处死刑的坚决判处死刑，罪该重判的坚决重判。在《通告》规定的期间，最高人民法院依法审理了一批严重经济犯罪案件，对其中情节特别严重、依法应当判处死刑的，核准了死刑。这些被核准死刑的罪犯，主要有以下几种情况：（1）罪行被察觉后，不坦白交代，而是继续犯罪。（2）隐瞒犯罪，畏罪潜逃，企图逃避法律制裁。（3）将犯罪所得巨款任意挥霍，给国家造成重大损失。
    任建新说，各地人民法院在适用《通告》审理经济犯罪案件中，坚持“一要坚决，二要慎重，务必搞准”的方针，始终坚持把事实搞清楚，把证据搞扎实，并注意查明案发经过和退赃、检举立功等情况，以确保办案质量。从而防止误把不是从轻、减轻情节当作从轻、减轻判处；或者误把假自首、假坦白作从宽处理；同时，也防止依法应该从宽的不敢从宽。
    他说，各地人民法院在结合宣传贯彻《通告》的同时，及时选择一批自首坦白、检举立功被从宽判处和拒不坦白交代被从严判处的典型案件，大张旗鼓地进行宣判。从8月15日到10月15日，各地人民法院共召开公开宣判大会1044次，宣判宽严典型案件2614件。其中，贪污576件，受贿283件，投机倒把53件；判处案犯4320人。其中，从宽判处772人，从严判处287人；从宽中，从轻判处351人，减轻判处251人，免予刑事处分170人。由于兑现了政策，大大发挥了《通告》的感召力和震慑力，扩大了办案的社会影响，对于敦促犯罪分子自首坦白，取得了明显的效果。如辽宁省丹东市中级法院9月8日召开政策兑现的宣判大会之后不到四天，投案自首人员就增加了一倍多。
