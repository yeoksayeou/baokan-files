The CCP Central Committee today held a grand meeting in the Zhongnanhai Hall to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Li Dazhao, a pioneer of the communist movement in China, a great Marxist, an outstanding revolutionary of the proletariat, and one of the main founders of the Communist Party of China.

CCP Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin attended the commemorative meeting and delivered an important speech (the full text will be published separately). He said that as an outstanding early leader of the Communist Party of China, Li Dazhao fought bravely on many fronts of the Chinese revolution and made significant contributions. In the Chinese communist movement and in the cause of national and social liberation of the Chinese people, he holds a lofty historical position.

The commemorative meeting was presided over by Comrade Peng Zhen. Comrades Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Li Tieying, Li Ximing, Qin Jiuwei, Ding Guangen, Song Rong, Wen Jiabao, Wang Shoudao, Liu Lantao, Yu Quli, Zhang Jinfu, Chen Xilian, Duan Junyi, Geng Biao, Huang Zhen, Kang Shien, Habib, Chen Xisheng, Liu Fuzhi, Kang Keqing, Hu Sheng, Lu Jiaxi, Hong Xuezhi, Liu Huaqing, and other leading comrades attended the commemorative meeting. Leaders from relevant central departments, representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, and representatives from the people of Beijing, totaling 1,000 people, participated in the commemorative meeting.

Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission Song Rong also spoke at the meeting. He said, "Looking back at the past and remembering the source, on this solemn commemorative meeting, let us express our highest respect and deep remembrance to this great revolutionary pioneer of the proletariat!"

After praising Li Dazhao's brilliant thoughts, lofty virtues, and revolutionary achievements, he said, "The socialist cause is a new undertaking in human history. In a vast country with a large population, complex situations, and backward economy and culture, to carry out socialist modernization construction is a great and arduous project that will inevitably encounter many difficulties. To achieve this great goal, not only do we need our Party, under the guidance of Marxism, to formulate correct lines, principles, and policies suitable for China's situation, but we also need our Party to lead the people to maintain and carry forward excellent revolutionary traditions, unite and strive together. The revolutionary tradition started by Li Dazhao and other old revolutionaries, and continued and enriched by subsequent generations of revolutionaries, is our Party's treasure for resisting corruption, defeating enemies, and remaining ever-victorious. It is a family heirloom that must be cherished and strived to be carried forward."

Song Rong pointed out that we should, like Li Dazhao and other pioneers, always have a firm belief in communist ideology and be infinitely loyal to the socialist cause. We must be highly vigilant against the "peaceful evolution" plot of international reactionary forces aimed at changing China's color, resolutely oppose the reactionary trend of bourgeois liberalization, and firmly defend the four cardinal principles as the foundation of the state, and firmly carry out reform and opening up and modernization construction.

Song Rong said that we should, like Li Dazhao and other pioneers, always maintain close ties with the people. We must remember the Party's motto of serving the people wholeheartedly, adhere to the line of "from the masses, to the masses," pay attention to listening to the people's voices, and resolutely correct and overcome all bureaucratism, commandism, using power for personal gain, and corrupt and decadent ideas and styles.

Song Rong said that we should, like Li Dazhao and other pioneers, always maintain and carry forward the spirit of hard work, practicality, and arduous struggle. We must remember that the style of a ruling party is a matter of life and death for the Party, educate all Party members, especially leading cadres, to withstand the test of being in power and the test of reform and opening up. We must strive to strengthen Party building, govern the Party strictly, and resolutely resist and overcome the phenomenon of corruption that erodes the Party's healthy body.

Song Rong finally said, "We believe that as long as we, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, resolutely implement the Party's basic line of 'one center, two basic points,' inherit and carry forward the Party's fine traditions, unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, work together, rely on our own efforts, and strive hard, we will definitely overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, and our socialist cause will definitely achieve new and greater victories."

Secretary of the Communist Youth League Central Committee Song Defu spoke at the meeting, saying that Comrade Li Dazhao was a mentor and friend of the youth. He believed in the youth, cared for the youth, and had high hopes for the youth, regarding the youth as the "foundation of youthful China" and the hope and future of China. He made his self-edited "Morning Bell" a "tongue of the youth," willing to use his own voice to contribute to "thickening the youth's cultivation, liberating the youth's spirit, strengthening the youth's will, and tempering the youth's integrity." In the May Fourth New Culture Movement, he enlightened many progressive youth, making them believe in Marxism and gather under the banner of Marxism to embark on the revolutionary road. In the early days of the revolution, he pointed the way for the youth, calling on them to go among the workers and peasants, understand the national situation, and temper themselves. When facing setbacks, he encouraged the youth's spirit and boosted their morale, reminding them that "the dictionary of youth has no word 'difficulty,' and the mouth of youth has no word 'obstacle.'" He was truly a revolutionary mentor of the youth.

Song Defu said that today, the best way for young friends to commemorate Comrade Li Dazhao is to take him as an example and learn from him. Learn from his patriotism, his self-awareness to take the revitalization of the motherland as his own responsibility; learn from his firm belief in spreading and defending Marxism; learn from his courage in practice, his down-to-earth, hardworking style; learn from his connection with the masses, his unity with comrades, his hard work and high moral character; learn from his warm-hearted care, love, education, guidance, and strict requirements for the youth. Use the actual actions of learning, practicing, and defending Marxism to comfort the spirit of Comrade Li Dazhao.

Song Defu pointed out that we commemorate Comrade Li Dazhao and learn from Comrade Li Dazhao, we should, like Comrade Li Dazhao, pursue Marxist truth. The broad youth should learn Marxism, first of all, to learn well the basic theory of Marxism, to master the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism. To seriously read the works of Marx and Lenin, the works of Mao Zedong, and the theoretical works of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries. To combine theory with practice, to use Marxism to guide our social practice, and to strive to become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

President of the Chinese Li Dazhao Research Association Wang Xuezhen spoke at the meeting, saying that we will definitely redouble our efforts to do a good job in the research of Li Dazhao, and give full play to the fighting role and educational role of Li Dazhao's research.

The commemorative meeting began with the majestic "National Anthem" and ended with the "Internationale." (Accompanied by a picture)

    据新华社北京10月28日电  （记者孙本尧）中共中央今天在中南海怀仁堂隆重举行大会，纪念我国共产主义运动的先驱、伟大的马克思主义者、杰出的无产阶级革命家、中国共产党的主要创始人之一李大钊同志诞辰100周年。
    中共中央总书记江泽民出席纪念大会并发表了重要讲话（全文另发）。他说，作为中国共产党早期的卓越领导人，李大钊在中国革命的许多条战线上进行过英勇的斗争，做出了重大的贡献。他在中国共产主义运动中，在中国人民的民族解放和社会解放事业中，占有崇高的历史地位。
    纪念大会由彭真同志主持。杨尚昆、李鹏、乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环、李铁映、李锡铭、秦基伟、丁关根、宋任穷、温家宝、王首道、刘澜涛、余秋里、张劲夫、陈锡联、段君毅、耿飚、黄镇、康世恩、习仲勋、陈希同、刘复之、康克清、胡绳、卢嘉锡、洪学智、刘华清等领导同志出席纪念大会。中央有关部门负责人、各民主党派和各人民团体代表及北京市的群众代表共1000人，参加了纪念大会。
    中顾委副主任宋任穷也在大会上讲了话。他说，抚今追昔，饮水思源，在这个隆重的纪念大会上，让我们向这位伟大的无产阶级革命先驱表示崇高的敬意和深挚的怀念！
    他在赞扬李大钊的光辉思想、崇高品德和革命业绩后说，社会主义事业是人类历史上崭新的事业。在一个幅员广大、人口众多、情况复杂、经济文化落后的国度里进行社会主义现代化建设，是一项伟大而艰巨的工程，必然会遇到许多困难。为了实现这个伟大的目标，不仅需要我们党在马克思主义指导下，制定出适合中国情况的正确的路线、方针和政策，而且需要我们党领导人民保持和发扬优良的革命传统，万众一心，团结奋斗。由李大钊等老一辈革命家开始培育、经过后来一代又一代革命者接续下来并不断丰富的革命传统，是我们党抗拒腐蚀、克敌制胜、常盛不衰的法宝，传家的法宝，必须加倍地爱护、珍惜并努力发扬光大。
    宋任穷指出，我们应当像李大钊等先驱那样，永远对共产主义思想具有坚定的信念，对社会主义事业无限忠诚。我们一定要高度警惕国际反动势力正在实施的妄图使中国改变颜色的“和平演变”阴谋，坚决反对资产阶级自由化的反动思潮，坚定不移地捍卫作为立国之本的四项基本原则，坚定不移地进行改革开放和现代化建设。
    宋任穷说，我们应当像李大钊等先驱那样，永远同人民群众保持密切的血肉联系。我们一定要牢记党的全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，坚持“从群众中来，到群众中去”的路线，切实注意倾听群众的呼声，坚决纠正和克服一切脱离群众的官僚主义、命令主义、以权谋私、腐化堕落等坏思想、坏作风。
    宋任穷说，我们应当像李大钊等先驱那样，永远保持和发扬勤劳务实、艰苦奋斗的精神。我们一定要牢记执政党的作风是一个关系到党的生死存亡的大问题，教育全体党员特别是党的领导干部，经得起执政的考验，经得起改革开放的考验。我们一定要努力加强党的建设，从严治党，坚决抵制和克服侵蚀党的健康肌体的腐败现象。
    宋任穷最后说，我们相信，只要我们在党中央的坚强领导下，坚决地贯彻执行党的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，继承和发扬党的优良传统，团结全国各族人民，齐心协力，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，我们就一定能克服前进道路上的各种困难，我们的社会主义事业就一定能取得新的更大的胜利。
    团中央第一书记宋德福在大会上讲话说，李大钊同志是青年的良师益友。他相信青年、关心青年，对青年寄予厚望，把青年看作是“青春中华之根基”，看作是中国的希望和未来。他把自己主编的《晨钟报》作为“青年之舌”，甘愿用自己的呐喊去为“厚青年之修养，畅青年之精神，壮青年之意志，砺青年之气节”尽一份力。在“五四”新文化运动中，他为许多进步青年启蒙，使他们信仰马克思主义，聚集在马克思主义的旗帜下，走上革命道路。在革命初期，他为青年指引方向，号召他们到工农群众中去，了解国情，锻炼自己。遇到挫折时，他为青年振奋精神、鼓舞士气，告诫他们“青年之字典，无‘困难’之字，青年之口头，无‘障碍’之语”，他无愧为青年的革命导师。
    宋德福说，今天，青年朋友对李大钊同志的最好纪念就是要以他为榜样，向他学习。学习他忧国忧民，自觉以祖国振兴为己任的革命献身精神；学习他热情传播、坚定捍卫马克思主义的坚定信念；学习他勇于实践、脚踏实地、埋头苦干的优良作风；学习他联系群众、团结同志、艰苦奋斗的高尚品德；学习他满腔热情地关心青年、爱护青年、教育青年、引导青年、严格要求青年的博大胸怀和革命责任感。用学习马克思主义、实践马克思主义、捍卫马克思主义的实际行动来慰藉李大钊同志的英灵。
    宋德福指出，我们纪念李大钊同志，学习李大钊同志，就要像李大钊同志那样去追求马克思主义真理。广大青年学习马克思主义，首先要学好马克思主义的基本理论，掌握马克思主义的立场、观点和方法。要认认真真读马列著作、毛泽东的著作，读老一辈无产阶级革命家的理论著作。要理论联系实际，用马克思主义指导我们的社会实践，努力使自己成长为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    中国李大钊研究会会长王学珍在大会上讲话时表示，我们一定加倍努力做好李大钊的研究工作，充分发挥李大钊研究的战斗作用和教育作用。
    纪念大会在雄壮的《国歌》中开始，在《国际歌》中结束。（附图片）
