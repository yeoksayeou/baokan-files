People's Daily, Beijing, October 9th.

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, China's handicraft industry has undergone a transformation from individual private ownership to collective ownership through socialist reform, leading to a fundamental change in its production landscape. In 1988, the total industrial output value of collective-owned enterprises nationwide reached 392.15 billion yuan (calculated at 1980 constant prices), which is over 100 times the total handicraft industry output value of 3.2 billion yuan in 1949 and more than three times the 81.44 billion yuan (calculated at 1970 constant prices) in 1978.

It is reported that in 1988, the number of workers in urban collective-owned industries nationwide was 18.5 million, with an average annual output value of 12,400 yuan per person. Since the reform and opening-up, the collective-owned industry has mainly relied on self-raised funds and self-accumulation for rapid development. In 1988, the original value of fixed assets of light industrial collective-owned enterprises reached 35.26 billion yuan, an increase of 2.93 times over the 8.97 billion yuan in 1978. In 1988, light industrial collective-owned economy earned 5.738 billion US dollars from exports, accounting for 71.64% of the total export earnings of the light industry system and 14% of the total national export earnings.
