East German People's Chamber Holds Meeting, Krenz Elected Chairman of the State Council, Emphasizes Better Development of Socialism

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 24th.

The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held its 10th meeting this morning.

The meeting accepted the proposal from the faction of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and, in response to Erich Honecker's request to step down due to health reasons, relieved him of his duties as Chairman of the State Council and Chairman of the National Defense Council. The meeting also decided to remove Mittag from his position as Vice Chairman of the State Council.

The meeting elected Egon Krenz as the new Chairman of the State Council and Chairman of the National Defense Council by an overwhelming majority.

After taking the oath of office, Krenz delivered a speech. He expressed his determination to fulfill his duties to the best of his abilities for the benefit of the people.

He stated that the recent 9th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany marked a turning point in the development of our workers' and peasants' state. As we enter the fifth decade of the German Democratic Republic, our responsibility is to better utilize the existing possibilities, face new challenges, and ensure that socialism develops even better in the 1990s.

Krenz pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is a workers' and peasants' state under the leadership of the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party. He emphasized the need to better utilize the roles of the People's Chamber and the Council of Ministers, as well as the roles of various parties and organizations within the National Front. He hoped that the people of all strata in the GDR would discuss and find the best solutions to the further development of socialism. He said, "We will reform what needs to be reformed. This is our task. However, political issues can only be resolved through political means, not through emotional outbursts. Protests and demonstrations will not solve the problems."

Krenz stressed that the stability of relations between the two Germanys is crucial for peace and security in Europe. The GDR will continue its policy of dialogue and cooperation with West Germany but will not allow interference in its internal affairs.

Krenz also expressed that the GDR will learn from the experiences of the Soviet Union without bias.

Chairman of the People's Chamber, Sinndem, presided over today's meeting.

Today's election was conducted by a show of hands. The GDR television broadcasted the meeting live. During the election of the Chairman of the State Council, there were 26 votes against and 26 abstentions. During the election of the Chairman of the National Defense Council, there were 7 votes against and 17 abstentions.

　　民德人民议院举行会议
　　克伦茨当选国务委员会主席
　　强调使社会主义更好发展
    本报柏林10月24日电　记者许宏治报道：民主德国人民议院今天上午举行第10次会议。
    会议接受德国统一社会党党团的建议，根据埃里希·昂纳克因健康原因提出的请求，解除他民主德国国务委员会主席、国防委员会主席的职务。会议决定免去米塔格国务委员会副主席的职务。
    会议以压倒多数票选举埃贡·克伦茨为民主德国国务委员会主席、国防委员会主席。
    克伦茨主席宣誓就职后，在会上发表了讲话。他表示将竭尽全力在这一重要岗位上为人民的利益而履行职责。
    他说，不久前召开的德国统一社会党9中全会在我们工农国家的发展史上是一个转折。在民主德国进入第5个十年时，我们的责任是，要更好地利用现实可能性，迎接新的挑战，使社会主义在90年代更好地得到发展。
    克伦茨指出，德意志民主共和国是在工人阶级及其马克思列宁主义政党领导下的工农国家。他强调要更好地发挥人民议院和部长会议的作用，更好地发挥全国阵线内各党派和团体的作用。他希望民德各阶层人民群众通过讨论，找到解决社会主义今后进一步发展问题的最好办法。他说，我们要改革的东西一定会改，这是我们的任务。但是政治问题只能通过政治手段来解决，不能感情用事。游行示威是解决不了问题的。
    克伦茨强调，两个德国关系的稳定对于欧洲的和平与安全是十分重要的。民德将坚持同西德对话与合作的政策，但不允许它对民德内政的干涉。
    克伦茨还表示，民德将不怀偏见地学习苏联的经验。
    人民议院主席辛德曼主持了今天的会议。
    今天的选举采用举手表决的办法进行。民德电视台转播了会议实况。在选举国务委员会主席时，有26票反对、26票弃权。在选举国防委员会主席时，有7票反对、17票弃权。
