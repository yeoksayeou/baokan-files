    The Goddess of Wushan is in Distress and Needs Immediate Protection

    The Goddess of Wushan in the Yangtze River's Wuxia Gorge stands at approximately 6.2 meters tall, elegantly perched on a stone ledge less than 2 meters wide. The Goddess has endured years of wind and rain erosion, resulting in severe weathering, cracks, and injuries all over her body. Her head can be moved. The stone pedestal on which the Goddess sits has some parts that are tilted, with cracks reaching depths of over 5 meters. The north side of the Goddess Peak has a longitudinal crack about half a meter wide, with vertical fractures. The Goddess and the Goddess Peak are in a precarious state.

    巫山神女有恙  急需尽早保护
    长江巫峡神女高约六米二，亭亭玉立于不到两米宽的石梁上。神女久经风雨浸蚀，风化严重，裂缝纵横，遍体鳞伤，头部可推动。神女坐墩石有的已倾斜，有的裂口深达五米以上。神女峰北侧东西纵向裂口约半米，上下断裂，神女及神女峰岌岌可危。
