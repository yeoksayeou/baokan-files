Significant progress has been made in China's special education for the intellectually disabled over the past decade. According to statistics from the State Education Commission, 24 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have established special education programs. There are now 158 special schools and a large number of attached special education classes, with a total of over 13,800 students enrolled. More than 3,000 intellectually disabled children have graduated from these schools. Through learning and training, their physical and mental deficiencies have been compensated to some extent, laying a foundation for further study, skill development, and becoming productive members of society who contribute to national construction. They have been warmly welcomed by parents and society at large.
