Li Peng Meets with Japanese Guests
Reaffirms that Developing Sino-Japanese Friendship is an Important Part of China's Foreign Policy

Beijing, October 3 — Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Yi reports: Premier Li Peng met with the visiting delegation from the Japanese Policy Research Council, led by Hōgane Shin'saku, at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this morning. Li Peng said that developing Sino-Japanese relations is an important component of China's independent and peaceful foreign policy. No matter what happens in the world, this policy will not change.

During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on Sino-Japanese relations and international issues of common concern.

Premier Li Peng said that China attaches great importance to its relations with Japan. Recently, Mr. Itō Masayoshi's visit to China has contributed to the development of bilateral relations. During China's National Day celebrations this year, many friends from Japan came to visit, and we are very pleased. We also hope that more Japanese groups and friends from various sectors will come to China to see for themselves and continue to push forward the development of bilateral relations.

Premier Li Peng also praised Mr. Hōgane Shin'saku's efforts in promoting Sino-Japanese relations. He said, "Mr. Hōgane Shin'saku has visited China many times and is very familiar with the situation in China. Mr. Hōgane Shin'saku has long been involved in diplomatic work, and the Policy Research Council is also well-known in Japan. We hope that Mr. Hōgane Shin'saku and the Policy Research Council will continue to contribute to the development of Sino-Japanese friendly relations."

Mr. Hōgane Shin'saku said that for Japan, China is one of the most important countries in its foreign relations. Historically, Japan has been greatly influenced by Chinese culture, and it is on this basis that Japan has developed to its current state.

He said that Mr. Itō Masayoshi's visit to China was very successful, and he was also very pleased. Mr. Itō's words in China and Japan have been highly regarded and trusted in Japan. He expressed that the two countries of Japan and China should join hands to seek common development.

The Japanese Policy Research Council delegation arrived in Beijing yesterday at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. Last night, President Han Nianlong hosted a dinner for the Japanese guests.

    本报北京10月3日讯　记者孙毅报道：国务院总理李鹏今天上午在钓鱼台国宾馆会见应邀来访的日本国策研究会访华团法眼晋作一行时说，发展中日关系是我国实行独立自主的和平外交政策的一个重要组成部分，不管世界上发生了什么事，我们的这个政策不会变。
    会见时，宾主就中日关系和共同关心的国际问题交换了意见。
    李鹏总理说，中国十分重视同日本的关系。不久前，伊东正义先生访华，为两国关系的发展作出了贡献。今年我国国庆期间，来自日本的朋友很多，我们很高兴，同时我们也希望日本更多的团体和各界朋友来中国看一看，同我们一起继续把两国关系推向前进。
    李鹏总理还赞扬了法眼晋作先生为发展中日关系所作的工作。他说，法眼晋作先生多次来中国访问，很熟悉中国的情况。法眼晋作先生长期在外交界工作，国策会在日本也很有名气，希望法眼晋作先生和国策会继续为发展中日友好关系作出努力。
    法眼晋作先生说，对日本来讲，中国是日本对外关系当中最重要的国家之一。历史上日本受中国文化的影响很大，也正是在这个基础上日本才有今天的发展。
    他说，伊东正义先生访华取得了很大的成功，我也感到非常高兴。伊东先生在中国和日本讲的话在日本受到很大的重视和信赖。他表示，日中两国应该携起手来，谋求共同的发展。
    日本国策研究会访华团是应中国外交学会的邀请于昨天抵京的。昨天晚上韩念龙会长宴请了日本客人。
