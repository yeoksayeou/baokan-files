A friend who had visited the Jiuxiang scenic area in Yiliang, Kunming, told me, "Jiuzhaigou in Sichuan and Jiuxiang in Yunnan, perhaps they are both ranked ninth, their strangeness and beauty are like twin sisters born from the same mother." Recently, I toured the Jiuxiang cave group and felt that it was indeed so.

This is a magical world. Standing amidst nearly a hundred cave groups, hearing the sounds of birds and the roaring of high gorges and underground rivers, and seeing the layers of jade pillars, green trees, and bamboo forming strange mountains, one feels intoxicated even before entering the cave. It was only with the urging of a local Yi girl guide that I came to my senses. Following her, we walked through dangerous rocks and clear waters and entered a large cave shaped like a white elephant. Jade trees and stone beasts, lions, dragons, and snakes came towards us, some with ferocious expressions, others gentle and lovable. This is a world of forests, and also a kingdom of animals. The white elephant guards the gate, and the dragon and lion reign supreme, a marvel of nature.

Exiting the White Elephant Cave, we entered the Goddess Palace. Sometimes it was a brilliant and splendid hall, other times a winding and mysterious maze. Caves within caves, large caves and small caves, wide caves and narrow caves, one had to bend down, and could not straighten up. The girl guide laughed heartily, "After many twists and turns, there will be a vast world, and the beauty of the jade maidens awaits you!" As soon as the words were spoken, the maze disappeared behind us. The cave gradually became larger, with purple mist like silk and stars twinkling, one by one, fairies floated down. The girl guide introduced, "This is Sister Chang'e, look, she is holding the jade rabbit! That is the Goddess of Mount Emei, hearing that the scenery in Jiuxiang is too beautiful, she came thousands of miles to this Yi village. As for that bathing beauty, it is said to be our sister Axiang, that demeanor, could it compare to the Miss Spring City?"

The Dragon Cave was cold and forbidding, with thunder rolling. I couldn't help but hesitate. The girl guide supported me with her delicate hand, climbing over the cliff path, down to the cave within the cave. Ten meters away, I saw waterfalls cascading, and jade and pearls sparkling. The waterfall in the cave was truly a marvel.

Strange mountains and caves, exiting the cave and crossing the bridge. The cave is the Water Curtain Cave, and the bridge is a natural bridge. There are bridges on the bridge, and bridges under the bridge. The girl said: This is a rare natural overpass in Jiuxiang. Standing on the bridge, one can see swallows flying high, deep valleys, green waters, forest waves, and bird songs. Following the water down to the valley bottom, the girl rowed over a rubber boat, and we rowed lightly on the river known as the "Soul-Stealing Gorge." For some reason, the previously rapid and dangerous gorge here turned into a segment of calm green water, with hanging jade pillars and stone stalagmites on both sides, green trees and flowers on top, and crystal-clear water droplets splashing onto the water surface, making a ting-ting-dong-dong sound. This is the "Tingdong Gorge." As the ting-dong sound faded, the blue sky became narrower. A huge rock pressed down from above, and the top of the gorge became a single line of sky. As the name suggests, this should be the "Single Line Gorge." The boat moved slowly forward, with green trees, red flowers, and strange flowers facing us. A group of mountain birds flew back and forth. I asked for the name, and the girl said, "Green trees and red flowers, blue waters and green sky, mountain birds chirping, the Yi people call it the Jade Gorge." When she knew I grew up drinking the water of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, she smiled and said, "The Yangtze River has the great Three Gorges, here is the small Three Gorges. Compared to your hometown, the scenery of Jiuxiang is not inferior, is it?"

　　九乡寻美
　　张永权
    一位去过昆明宜良九乡风景区的朋友对我说：“四川的九寨沟和云南的九乡溶洞，也许她们都是排行老九，那奇那美那秀，真是如同一母所生的双胞胎姐妹。”不久前我游了九乡的溶洞群，感到确实如此。
    这是一个神奇的天地。置身在近百个溶洞群体之中，耳畔响着鸟语和高峡暗河的涛声，望着悠悠碧水层层玉柱、绿树、翠竹缀成的奇山，还未进洞，人先醉了。直到当地彝家导游姑娘的催促，我才回过神来。跟随她，我们走过险岩秀水，进入一个形如白象的大洞，玉树石兽、狮虎龙蛇迎面走来，有的面目狰狞，有的温柔可爱。这是森林的世界，也是动物的王国。白象守门，龙狮称王，鬼斧神工。
    出了白象洞，步入神女宫。或者灿烂辉煌的大厅，时而曲径通幽的迷宫。洞中套洞，大洞小洞，宽洞窄洞，人要低头，更不能直腰。导游姑娘爽朗一笑：“千回百折，终有广阔天地，玉女美景等着你哩！”话音才落，迷宫已消失在身后。洞天渐渐变大，紫雾如纱，群星闪烁，一个个仙女飘然而降。导游姑娘介绍说：“这位嫦娥姐姐，你看，她抱着的可是玉兔哩！那是巫山神女，听说九乡风景太美，便不远千里来到这彝家山寨。至于那位出浴美人，据说是我们的阿诗玛姐姐，那神韵，春城小姐可能相比么？”
    卧龙洞寒气逼人，雷霆滚滚，我不禁望而却步。导游姑娘秀手相扶，攀过悬崖栈道，下到洞下之洞。10米开外，但见飞流直下，珠玉闪烁。洞中的瀑布堪称一绝。
    奇山奇洞出洞过桥。洞是水帘洞，桥是天生桥。桥上有桥，桥下又有桥。姑娘说：这是九乡罕见的天然立交桥了。站在桥上，可看岩燕高翔。幽谷碧水，林涛鸟语。循水下到谷底，姑娘划来一只橡皮舟，我们便在这被称为“销魂峡”的河上荡起轻舟。不知何故，刚才还是急流险滩的峡谷，到此却化为一段平缓青流，夹岸倒悬玉柱石笋，其上绿树繁花，晶亮的水珠扑到水面，发出叮叮咚咚的声音。这便是“叮咚峡”。叮咚远了，蓝天越来越窄。一块巨石凌空压下，峡顶顿成一线天。顾名思义，这该是一线峡了。轻舟缓缓前行，迎面石笋绿树奇花，一群山雀飞来飞去。我问地名，姑娘说，绿树红花，碧水青天，山雀长鸣，彝家叫它碧玉峡。当她知道我是喝长江三峡的水长大的，便笑道：“长江是大三峡，这儿是小三峡。比起你家乡，九乡风光也不差吧？”
