Japan is currently the most promising international art market in the world. According to statistics from the Japanese customs, from January to August 1987, Japan imported a total of 872,900 paintings from abroad, with a total value of 73.4 billion yen.

The reason why Japanese people are eager to buy world-famous paintings is that with the development of the economy and the significant appreciation of the yen, some Japanese enterprises and individuals have accumulated a large amount of surplus funds. Their purchase of famous paintings is not just for cultural refinement, but mainly because it is an important means of preserving and appreciating currency value. Therefore, in addition to investing in the stock market and real estate, some Japanese tycoons are also competing to buy artworks. Moreover, the Japanese customs do not inspect or tax those who bring paintings into the country, which provides convenience for some art dealers.

In October 1984, France lost five priceless paintings, including "Twilight," "Orchard," and "Portrait of Madame B." In 1985, three criminals stole the masterpiece "Impression: Sunrise" by the Impressionist painter Monet. These two major cases were eventually solved by the Japanese police.

Additionally, some Japanese companies use artworks as a means of public relations. The Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company spent 5.8 billion yen to purchase the famous painting "Sunflowers" by the Dutch master Vincent van Gogh and hung it prominently in the company's lobby to showcase the company's wealth and luxury, thereby promoting the company's absolute safety and reliability, and improving the company's economic benefits. After this, a wave of purchasing products with sunflower patterns quickly swept through the Japanese market, and the trend was unprecedented.

    日本人为何垂青艺术珍品
    日本是目前世界上最有潜力的国际名画市场。据日本海关统计，1987年1月至8月，日本从海外购入各类绘画总数为87.29万幅，总金额达734亿日元。
      日本人争相购买世界名画的原因是，随着经济的发展和日元大幅度升值，日本一些企业和个人掌握了大量剩余资金，他们购买名画倒不单单是附庸风雅，主要还是因为它是货币保值、升值的一种重要手段。所以，日本的一些富翁除了向股市、房地产投资外，还竞相购买艺术品。此外，日本海关对携画入境者不检查，不征税，为一些艺术品贩子提供了方便。
    1984年10月，法国失窃了价值连城的5幅名画，其中有《黄昏》、《果树园》、《勃德夫人的肖像》；1985年，3名歹徒又在法国偷走了印象派大师莫奈的代表作《日出印象》。这两起重大案件，最后都在日本被警方破获。
    另外，日本一些公司还以艺术品作为公关手段。安田火灾海上保险公司以58亿日元巨款，买下荷兰著名画家凡·高的名画《向日葵》，把它高悬在公司的大厅里，展示给八方来客，以显示公司的富有和豪华，宣传公司信誉的绝对安全可靠，从而提高了公司的经济效益。在此之后，日本市场上很快掀起一股购买有向日葵图案的系列产品的风潮，并且盛况空前。
