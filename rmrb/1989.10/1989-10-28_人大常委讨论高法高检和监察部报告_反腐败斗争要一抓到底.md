The NPC Standing Committee Discusses Reports from the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Supervision Department
Anti-Corruption Struggle Must Be Persisted Until the End

Today, at the 10th meeting of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee, members discussed the work reports from the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Supervision Department. They unanimously agreed to strongly support the judicial, procuratorial, and supervisory departments in their anti-corruption and anti-graft efforts.

At the 10th meeting of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee, members listened to and deliberated on the reports titled "Report on the Implementation of the 'Notice' by the Two Courts," "Report on the Anti-Graft and Anti-Bribery Efforts by the Procuratorial Organs," and "Report on the Anti-Corruption Efforts by the Supervisory Organs This Year and the Next Steps." Members believed that the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Supervision Department have done a lot of work in the fight against corruption and the punishment of embezzlement and bribery, achieving initial results. This task is heavy and difficult, and it should be persistently carried out to the end. The National People's Congress and local people's congresses at various levels should strongly support this work. Some members suggested that various levels of people's congresses should support difficult cases, especially when investigating some leaders, more support should be provided.

Members believe that from the previous anti-corruption and anti-graft work, some departments in our country have serious corruption problems. Some state cadres, including party cadres, have lost their principles in the face of money and material temptations, damaging state interests, seeking personal gain, and becoming corrupt. Although party corruption is rare, its impact is very bad. In the process of anti-corruption and emphasizing clean governance, there is also great resistance, which increases the complexity of the work. We should have a full understanding and recognition of this. At the same time, our means of combating economic crimes are relatively backward, affecting the progress of the work. Therefore, it is suggested that the state financial departments increase the necessary funds to improve work efficiency.

Members proposed that the judicial, procuratorial, and supervisory departments should truly uphold the principle of equality before the law, with the standards of leniency and severity based on the law, facts as the basis, and strictly enforce the law. Some members believe that some leading cadres lightly dismiss the issue of their children, which should be noted. Some members pointed out that in this work, we should not be afraid of pulling out the radish with the mud. Some members said that we should consider that the anti-corruption struggle is a matter that is deeply supported by the people and is of great concern to the masses. The masses have the initiative to report, and the law enforcement departments should strictly protect the safety of informants. At the same time, we need to further solve the problem of substituting fines for criminal penalties.

Some members believe that the current depth and breadth of the anti-corruption struggle are not enough, and it will be more difficult to deepen it. We should further clarify various policy boundaries, and anti-corruption and clean governance should be brought into the track of democracy and the rule of law. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the State Council should promptly formulate relevant laws.

　　人大常委讨论高法高检和监察部报告
　　反腐败斗争要一抓到底
    本报北京10月27日讯　今天，在七届全国人大常委会第十次会议上，委员们讨论最高人民法院、最高人民检察院和监察部的工作报告时，一致提出，要大力支持审判、检察机关和监察部门的反腐败惩治贪污受贿的斗争。
    在七届全国人大常委第十次会议上，委员们听取了《关于人民法院贯彻执行两院“通告”的情况报告》、《关于检察机关开展反贪污、贿赂斗争情况的报告》、《关于监察机关今年以来开展反腐败斗争的情况及下一步工作的汇报》以后，进行了认真审议。委员们认为，最高人民法院、最高人民检察院和监察部在反腐败和惩治贪污受贿斗争中做了大量工作，取得了初步成效。这一工作任务很重，难度很大，应长期坚持抓下去，一抓到底。全国人大和地方各级人大应对这项工作给予大力支持。有的委员建议，各级人大对疑难案件要出面支持，特别是查到个别领导人时，更应支持。
    委员们认为，从前一段反腐败和惩治贪污受贿的工作情况来看，在我们国家的某些部门的部分人中，腐败现象比较严重，某些国家干部，包括党的干部在金钱和物质诱惑面前，丧失原则，损害国家利益，以权谋私，腐化堕落。党内腐败分子虽是极少数，但影响极坏。而在进行反腐败和强调廉政建设中，阻力也很大，这就增加了工作的复杂性。对此，要有充分估计和认识。同时，我们打击经济犯罪手段还比较落后，使工作进展受到一定影响。因此，建议国家财政部门增加必要的经费，提高工作效能。
    委员们提出，审判、检察机关和监察部门在执法上，要真正做到法律面前人人平等，宽严尺度要以法律为准绳，以事实为依据，严格依法办事。有的委员认为，有的领导干部一提到子女的问题就轻描淡写，应当引起注意。有的委员指出，在这项工作中，不要怕拔出萝卜带出泥。有的委员说，要考虑到反腐败斗争是深得人心的事，是广大群众关心的事，群众有举报的积极性，执法部门要严格保护举报人的安全。同时，还需进一步解决以罚代刑的问题。
    还有的委员认为，当前反腐败斗争的深度广度还不够，深入下去难度将更大。应进一步明确各种政策界限，反腐败和廉政建设应纳入民主与法制轨道，全国人大常委会和国务院应尽快制定与此有关的法律。
