Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji pointed out at a meeting with Shanghai's arts community yesterday that the arts community must have a firm and correct political direction, must continuously engage with life, and must insist on development and innovation.

Before and after National Day, 900 arts workers from Shanghai traveled to Beijing, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Urumqi to participate in the performances of the Second Chinese Art Festival. Their superb skills and good discipline left a deep impression on the audience.

Zhu Rongji said that Shanghai's arts community has achieved great success this time, and in the face of these achievements, we must summarize our experiences. He hopes that the arts community will uphold a serious and dedicated artistic spirit, and work hard on solid basic skills. They must engage with life and innovate. He emphasized that while they must be true to life, they must also have a firm and correct political direction. They must integrate the spirit of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization into artistic practice and creation, so that Shanghai's arts industry can develop along the correct path, continuously advance, and become even more prosperous.

Zhu Rongji also pointed out that Shanghai's culture and arts have comprehensive advantages and have the conditions to promote and revitalize the unique Shanghai School of art. Shanghai's leaders at all levels must, from the perspective of promoting the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, attach importance to cultural and artistic work, inspire the people of Shanghai to work together, overcome difficulties, and revitalize Shanghai.

Notable figures from the arts community, including Yu Zhenfei, Yuan Xuefen, Ding Shende, Huang Yujun, Xiao Wenyan, Ren Deyao, Shang Changrong, Zhu Jian'er, Chen Shaoyang, Yan Xingpeng, Liang Guyin, Gu Xiuyi, Ding Zhinuo, Shi Hong'e, and Yan Shunkai, participated in the meeting.
