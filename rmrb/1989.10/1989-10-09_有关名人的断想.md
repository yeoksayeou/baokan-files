    The vast world is filled with countless people, and the river of history, through the sifting of waves, continually brings forth innumerable famous individuals from one generation to the next.

    Famous people come in many forms, and the paths to fame are countless. Commanding armies in battle can make one famous, writing books and establishing theories can make one famous, acting and singing can make one famous, capturing thieves, growing flowers, raising pigs, playing cards, and playing chess can all make one famous.

    Becoming a famous person is not easy. Because of that "fame," one can enter the hall and sit in a chair; but it can also inexplicably bring a series of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy experiences, making the famous person laugh and cry or feel deeply sad. No wonder some famous people sigh, "It's hard to be a person, and it's even harder to be a famous person!" "Avoiding fame is like avoiding duty!"

    Famous people are not all pure and genuine.

    Some are truly famous because of genuine knowledge and skills; others puff themselves up like a swollen face, relying on luck to blow up their reputation; some only know a few tricks, relying on a few "iron brothers" to push them to fame; some are essentially inferior goods, but are packaged in a "Maotai" bottle to be sold as famous...

    Different famous people will have different outcomes: some shine brightly like the sun and moon, standing the test of practice and leaving their names in history; some make a lot of noise, blooming briefly like a flower in the night, becoming transient figures in history; some have their tricks exposed, making fools of themselves on the spot, becoming worthless, leaving behind laughing stocks...

    Some people have a peculiar habit of always wanting to know the slightest details of famous people's lives or private affairs, using them as topics for casual conversation. Some, by possessing exclusive news about a famous person, seem to have become famous themselves; others, with a tenuous connection to a famous person, act as if they are agents or spokespeople, strutting around; and there are those who specialize in collecting the romantic affairs of famous people, writing endless volumes of "masterpieces" to make a fortune...

    Fame is both a crown of glory and a mirror.

### 有关名人的断想

    有关名人的断想
    大千世界，芸芸众生，历史长河，大浪淘沙，一代又一代如潮似波地推出无可计数的各种名人。
    名人有多种多样，成名的途径也有千条万条。带兵打仗能成名人，著书立说能成名人，演戏唱歌能成名人，擒贼捉盗、种花、养猪、打牌、下棋也能成名人。
    做一个名人也不容易。因了那“名”，登堂入室，坐上一把椅子；但也会莫名其妙地引出一串酸甜苦辣，令成名者啼笑皆非或倍感悲哀。难怪乎有名人长叹：“做人难，做名人更难！”“逃名如逃役！”
    名人也非清一色的道地、纯正。
    有货真价实靠真学问真本事干出来的；也有打肿脸充胖子靠机遇吹出来的；有只会几下花拳绣腿靠几个“铁哥们”使足了劲捧出来的；有压根儿就是劣质酒，却弄来“茅台”瓶装出来的……
    不同的名人也就有了不同的结局：有的光昭日月，经得起实践检验而名垂青史；有的闹闹热热，昙花一现，成为历史上的匆匆过客；有的西洋镜被拆穿，当场出丑，一文不值，留下笑柄……
    有的人有一种“毛病”，专爱打听各种名人的一颦一笑或私生活，作为茶余饭后的谈助。有的靠着掌握某名人的独家新闻自己仿佛也成了名人；同某名人七弯八绕地沾了那么一点儿边却俨然以代理人、代言人身份招摇过市；还有以专门搜罗某名人风流韵事而连篇累牍地炮制“大作”以发横财的……名人既是一顶桂冠，也是一面镜子。
