Welcoming the Four Seas, Scholars Gather
International Scholars Commemorate the 2540th Anniversary of Confucius' Birthday

	BEIJING, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) -- With Confucianism as its mainstay, Chinese culture has long shone brightly in human history, but it has dimmed in the past two centuries. Today, more than 300 scholars and dignitaries from 25 countries and regions across five continents gathered in Beijing to commemorate the 2540th anniversary of Confucius' birthday and discuss the historical status of Confucian thought and its impact on modern society. This is a major academic event in the international scholarly community.

	The scholars attending the conference agreed that Confucius was a great thinker, educator, and statesman in ancient China. He was virtuous and learned, dedicating his life to cultural education and founding the Confucian school, becoming one of the important founders of traditional Chinese culture.

	On the issue of how to view traditional culture and foreign culture, Gu Muqi, honorary president of the Chinese Confucius Foundation, spoke at the conference, pointing out: "Undoubtedly, one should take the culture of one's own nation as the mainstay. Because the development of any nation cannot be separated from its national conditions, and the transformation of any national culture cannot be separated from the traditional culture of its own nation. If one adopts a nihilistic attitude towards the traditional culture of one's own nation, one loses the foundation for absorbing and digesting foreign culture, and thus cannot talk about the construction and development of new culture."

	He said, "The idea of 'harmony' is an important part of traditional Chinese culture. Confucius and the Confucian school proposed the proposition of 'harmony is precious' and established a series of theories about coordinating interpersonal relationships, protecting the natural environment, and maintaining ecological balance. These ideas not only made positive contributions to the prosperity of ancient Chinese society, but even today, they still have practical significance for human survival and development."

	Representatives from UNESCO, including Sinhaseni, former Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Chairman of the East Asian Philosophy Research Institute Wu Qingrui, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Ho Yingdong, and Academician Fyodorov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, spoke at today's commemorative meeting.

	In the academic report meeting held this afternoon, scholars from Singapore, Japan, the United States, Switzerland, and China gave reports. The conference also read the paper titled "The Relationship between Confucian Educational Thought and Taiwan's Economic Development" by Chen Lifu from Taiwan.

    逢迎四海　硕学满座
    中外学者纪念孔子诞辰2540周年
    本报北京10月7日讯　记者蒋涵箴报道：以儒家学说为主流的中国文化在人类历史上曾长期闪耀着绚丽多彩的光辉，近二百年来却暗淡了。而今天来自世界五大洲25个国家和地区的300多位名流学者云集北京，纪念孔子诞辰2540周年，讨论孔子儒家思想的历史地位和对现代社会的影响。这是国际学术界的一大盛会。
    与会学者认为，孔子是中国古代伟大思想家、教育家、政治家，他德行高洁，学问渊博，一生从事文化教育，创立儒家学派，成为中国传统文化的一位重要奠基人。
    就如何看待传统文化和外来文化的问题，中国孔子基金会名誉会长谷牧在会上发言指出：“无疑应当以本民族的文化为主体。因为任何民族的发展，都不可能离开它的国情，任何民族文化的变革，都不能离开本民族的传统文化。如果对本民族的传统文化采取虚无主义的态度，就失去了吸收和消化外来文化的基础，也就根本谈不上新文化的建设和发展。”
    他说，“和谐”思想是中国传统文化中的一项重要内容。孔子、儒家学派提出了“和为贵”的命题，并建立起一系列关于协调人际关系，保护自然环境，维持生态平衡的学说。这些思想不仅为中国古代社会的昌盛做出过积极的贡献，即使到了今天，它对人类的生存发展也仍然具有现实意义。
    联合国教科文组织总干事代表辛那塞、新加坡前第一副总理、东亚哲学研究所董事长吴庆瑞、香港中华总商会会长霍英东、苏联科学院通讯院士费德林教授等在今天的纪念会上发了言。
    今天下午举行的学术报告会上，新加坡、日本、美国、瑞士和中国等国的学者在会上作了报告。会上还宣读了台湾陈立夫的题为《儒家教育思想与我台湾经济发展之关系》的论文。
