The women's championship match of the East Asian Tennis Team Tournament was held today in Beijing. The South Korean team successfully defended their title after a grueling five-hour battle against the Chinese young players. The Chinese women's team won second place.

The final match started with Tang Min facing off against South Korea's second singles player Lin Shuzhi. The 18-year-old Tang Min was overly nervous and played cautiously, losing 1-2. The subsequent match between the two teams' first singles was even more intense. China's Chen Li fought hard against South Korea's veteran Kim Yishun. Both sides played three sets, and Chen Li eventually lost 1-2.

In the men's semifinals held simultaneously, China's first team defeated the Chinese Taipei team 3-0, while China's second team lost 1-2 to the defending champions from South Korea. Tomorrow, China's first team will compete against the South Korean team for the men's championship.

    在同时进行的两场男子半决赛中，中国一队以三比零胜中国台北队，中国二队以一比二负于上届冠军南朝鲜队。明天，中国一队将与南朝鲜队争夺男子冠军。
