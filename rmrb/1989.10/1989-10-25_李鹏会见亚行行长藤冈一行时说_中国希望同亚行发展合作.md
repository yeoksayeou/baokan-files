	New China News Agency, Beijing, October 24 (Reporter Zhou Shuchun): Premier Li Peng today, in meeting with President Takaaki Ogawa of the Asian Development Bank and his delegation, expressed that China hopes to maintain and further develop its cooperative relationship with the ADB.

	Li Peng extended a warm welcome to Ogawa and more than 30 foreign bankers, government officials, and ADB staff who came to Beijing to attend the ADB's seventh development strategy roundtable conference. He wished the conference a great success.

	During the meeting, Li Peng first thanked and praised the outgoing President Ogawa for his positive role in restoring China's seat in the ADB and promoting the ADB's business relations with China during his tenure.

	He said: Since China joined the ADB in 1986, it has maintained good relations with the ADB. Practice has proven that there is great potential for cooperation between the two sides. "We sincerely hope to maintain and further develop this cooperative relationship and jointly contribute to the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region."

	Li Peng reiterated that China's basic policy towards foreign relations has not changed. He said: The foundation of China's construction is mainly relying on its own strength, "but we do not practice isolationism, nor do we exclude the absorption of advanced foreign science and technology, management experience, and a certain amount of capital."

	Li Peng welcomed more foreign economic figures and people from all walks of life to visit China.

	When introducing the domestic situation in China, Li Peng said: China is carrying out the work of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening reforms in a planned and step-by-step manner. Although the economy currently faces some difficulties, overall, the national economy is developing in a more stable and rational direction.

	Ogawa said that since China joined the ADB a few years ago, the cooperation between the ADB and China has been "very good." He said that the ADB is preparing and executing some cooperative projects with China. For example, in the loan projects to China, the ADB is actively preparing and will soon submit them to the board of directors for discussion.

	He said that during his visit to China, he personally felt that the Chinese people support reform and opening up and are willing to develop friendly relations with various countries. Ogawa expressed that although he is about to step down, he is willing to continue to make efforts to develop relations with China.

	During the meeting, Vice Premier and Governor of the People's Bank of China Li Guixian and Director-General of the State Council's Economic and Technological Research Center Ma Hong were present. The roundtable conference, themed "Social and Economic Policies to Eliminate Poverty," was jointly organized by the ADB, the People's Bank of China, and the State Council's Economic and Technological Research Center, and was held in Beijing from October 24 to 28.

	After the meeting, Li Guixian and Ma Hong hosted a banquet at the Great Hall of the People to entertain the representatives attending the conference.

　　中国希望同亚行发展合作
    新华社北京10月24日电  （记者周树春）国务院总理李鹏今天在会见亚洲开发银行行长藤冈真佐夫一行时表示，中国希望保持并进一步发展同亚行的合作关系。
    李鹏总理对藤冈等30多位外国银行家、政府官员和亚行官员来京参加亚行第七次发展战略圆桌会议表示热烈欢迎，并预祝会议取得成功。
    会见时，李鹏首先感谢并赞赏即将卸任的藤冈行长在任职期间，对恢复中国在亚行的席位、推动亚行对中国的业务关系所发挥的积极作用。
    他说：中国自1986年加入亚行以来，与亚行一直保持着良好的关系；实践证明，双方合作具有很大的潜力。“我们真诚希望保持并进一步发展这种合作关系，共同为亚太地区的经济发展作出贡献。”
    李鹏重申，中国对外关系的基本方针没有改变。他说：中国进行建设的立足点主要是依靠自己的力量，“但我们不搞闭关自守，不排除吸收外国先进的科学技术、管理经验和一定数量的资金。”
    李鹏欢迎更多的外国经济界人士和其他各界人士来中国访问。
    在介绍中国国内情况时，李鹏说：中国正在有计划、有步骤地进行治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和深化改革的工作。尽管当前经济上面临一些困难，但总的来说，国民经济是向着更加稳定、更加合理的方向发展。
    藤冈说，中国加入亚行几年来，亚行与中国的合作是“非常好的”。他说，亚行正在准备和执行与中国合作的一些项目。例如，在向中国贷款的项目上，亚行正在积极地做准备，很快将提交董事会讨论。
    他说，访华期间他亲身了解到中国人民是拥护改革开放的，也愿意与各国发展友好往来。藤冈表示，他虽然即将卸任，但愿意继续为发展对华关系作出努力。
    会见时，国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜和国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心总干事马洪在座。这次题为“消除贫困的社会经济政策”的圆桌会议由亚行与中国人民银行和国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心联合举办，于本月24日至28日在京召开。
