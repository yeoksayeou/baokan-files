The People's Daily reports that over the past four years, due to the development of the feed industry and the promotion and use of compound feeds, the livestock industry has saved over 350 million tons of grain. This has ensured the continuous and stable growth of livestock, poultry, and aquatic products despite the scarcity of grain resources.

China's feed industry, although started late, has developed rapidly and achieved significant economic and social benefits. Currently, there are 6,200 feed processing plants nationwide with a capacity of over 1 ton per hour, including 420 plants with a capacity of over 5 tons per hour. The total capacity for compound and mixed feed processing is over 40 million tons. From 1984 to 1988, a total of 101 million tons of compound and mixed feeds were produced, with an annual increase of 4 million tons. Calculating based on the feed conversion rate being one-third higher than single feeds, an average of 700 million tons of grain is saved each year. Compared to the same amount of single feeds, these compound feeds have converted an additional 80 million tons of pork or 100 million tons of eggs. Over the past four years, China's grain production has stagnated, but the production of meat, eggs, milk, and aquatic products has increased by 10.8% and 14.4% annually, respectively. The rapid development of the feed industry is a significant factor in this growth.

It is reported that China's annual feed consumption is approximately 100 billion kilograms, but only 30% is processed into compound feeds. The remaining 70% of raw grain is fed directly to livestock by farmers, resulting in low feed conversion rates. If all 300 million pigs in the country were fed compound feeds, it would save over 15 billion kilograms of grain, equivalent to the annual total production of a major grain-producing province.

　　提高粮食转化率　保证养殖业增长
　　我国饲料工业迅速崛起
　　四年节约饲料用粮3500万吨
    本报讯　记者江夏从农业部了解到，近四年由于饲料工业的发展、配合饲料的推广和使用，全国饲养业少消耗粮食3500多万吨。在粮食资源紧缺的情况下，保证了畜禽鱼类产品的持续稳步增长。
    我国的饲料工业起步较晚，但发展迅速，并取得显著经济效益和社会效益。现在全国已建成时产1吨以上的饲料加工厂6200个，其中时产5吨以上的420个，形成配、混合饲料加工能力4000多万吨。1984年到1988年，共生产配、混合饲料1.01亿吨，年产以400万吨的增幅递增，按其饲料报酬比单一饲料高1／3计算，平均每年节粮700万吨；与同量的单一饲料相比，这些配合饲料多转化出800万吨猪肉或1000万吨鸡蛋。近4年我国粮食生产连续徘徊，饲料用粮趋于稳定，而肉蛋奶和水产品产量却以年递增10.8％和14.4％的速度持续增长，饲料工业的迅速发展是重要因素之一。
    据介绍，我国每年饲料用量约1000亿公斤，只有30％被加工成配合饲料，另外70％的原粮由农民直接喂了畜禽，饲料报酬很低。而全国3亿多头猪，如果都用配合饲料喂养，可节省150多亿公斤粮食，相当于一个粮食主产省的年总产量。
