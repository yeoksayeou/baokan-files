In September 1986, over ten thousand villagers from six villages in Wuyang Town—Liuwang, Xiaojia, Wuyang, Maoping, Sanfang, Xiushui, and Liantan—each contributed 5 yuan from their grain sales income, totaling 50,000 yuan. This money was intended for the construction of the Wuyang Town Central Primary School. However, in 1987, a deputy secretary of the town party committee allocated 3,000 yuan from the collected funds to Liu Baotao, the former village committee director of Xiushui Village, for the construction of a private house. Shortly after, a responsible person from the town people's congress also issued a voucher, lending 1,500 yuan to Huang Yun'an, the former village committee director of Liantan Village, for the construction of a private house. Additionally, 4,000 yuan was lent to Huang Minyan and others to establish a cement pole factory. Over the past two years, the hard-earned money collected by the people of Wuyang Town has mostly been misappropriated by a few individuals under various pretexts.

The villagers have not seen the newly constructed school buildings, nor have they seen the location of the school construction. The whereabouts of the construction funds are also unknown. They have demanded that the town leaders disclose the construction situation and the whereabouts of the funds. However, the town has been slow to respond. Last July, the villagers of Liuwang Village had to report to the county disciplinary committee. The county disciplinary committee entrusted Wuyang Town to investigate and handle the matter, but the issue remains unresolved.

The villagers are frustrated and demand transparency and accountability from the town leadership. The misappropriation of public funds for private gain is a serious issue that needs to be addressed promptly. The town leaders must take responsibility and provide a clear account of the funds and the construction progress.

    群众集资款被挪用  领导造私房难查处
    1986年9月，我县武阳镇六王、肖家、武阳、茅坪、三房、秀水、莲塘7个村的万余名村民，从当年卖粮款中每人扣除5元，集资5万元，用于修建武阳镇中心小学。然而，1987年，镇党委一位副书记从集资款中批出3000元，借给这个镇秀水村原村民委员会主任刘时报修建私房；紧接着，镇人大一位负责人也慷慨批条，借1500元给莲塘村原村民委员会主任黄运安修建私房；借4000元给黄民岩等人办水泥电杆厂。两年多来，武阳镇群众用卖粮款筹集起来的辛苦钱，大多被少数人巧立名目挪用了。
    群众既见不到新修的校舍，也见不到建校的地址，建校集资款也不知去向。他们要求镇领导人公布建校情况和集资款的去向。但镇里却迟迟不作答复。去年7月，六王村村民只好向县纪委反映，县纪委委托武阳镇调查处理，结果仍不了了之。
