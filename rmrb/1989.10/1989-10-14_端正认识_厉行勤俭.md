    Correct Understanding and Practice Thrift

    The central authorities have proposed that we need to tighten our belts for a few years, which is of great significance for rectification and deepening reform. However, implementing this in practice is not as easy as it seems.

    "As long as you don't line your own pockets, you can do anything." Some leaders often use the collective as a shield, freely approving expenses, casually signing off on purchases, and acquiring high-end office supplies and unauthorized construction projects, spending money recklessly. Those who bring some benefits to their units in this way are not hated by others; instead, some are even praised as "bold and innovative" officials.

    "For the sake of everyone's welfare, bending the rules is acceptable." In recent years, higher authorities have repeatedly banned the indiscriminate distribution of various goods and subsidies. However, some units and departments still find ways to issue bonuses and subsidies, and the practice of using public funds for New Year and festival celebrations is common. The necessary explanations are not given, and the required ideological work is not done; instead, distributing money and goods is seen as a magical solution to motivate people.

    "If the higher-ups don't tighten their belts, we'll just follow suit." The necessity of tightening our belts is gradually being recognized. However, some units and departments are not able to do so, which is related to the lack of exemplary leadership from higher-ups. Some higher-level leaders only talk about it but do not lead by example, resulting in lower-level units following suit. When higher-ups tighten their belts, lower levels will follow; when higher-ups loosen up, lower levels will indulge in extravagance.

    "If the collective decides, even if it's wrong, it's acceptable." Nowadays, there are instances of collective violations. For example, some units undertake unauthorized construction projects, some purchase cars without authorization, and some distribute various goods and subsidies indiscriminately. When responsibilities are investigated, it is always decided collectively. Some units believe that as long as the decision-making process is legal, even if the decision is wrong, they have a "sufficient reason" to shirk responsibility. Even when higher authorities investigate, the punishment is often more bark than bite, with the stick raised high but coming down lightly, and not hitting anyone specifically.

    To eliminate the above negative attitudes and consciously cultivate the mindset of tightening our belts, we need to do work in many areas. We need to use various methods to conduct in-depth education on hard work and self-reliance, truly helping people understand the national situation, and firmly establishing the idea of building the country through thrift and tightening our belts. Leaders at all levels should set an example, lead by example, not seek any privileges beyond policy regulations, not accept any special treatment from anyone, use their power prudently, strictly adhere to policy regulations, and influence and inspire the masses with their clean and upright image. For weak links where problems are likely to occur, we should establish and improve various budgeting, decision-making, leadership responsibility, inspection, supervision, and reward and punishment systems, and implement them seriously.

### 端正认识　厉行勤俭

    端正认识　厉行勤俭
    中央提出，要过几年紧日子，这对于治理整顿，深化改革，具有重要意义，但在实际执行过程中并非轻而易举。
    “不装个人腰包，干啥都行。”有的领导人时常打着为集体的招牌，在经费开支问题上，随便“点头”，信手“批条”，添置高档办公用品，搞计划外基建工程等，花钱大手大脚。对这种为本单位带来一定“好处”的人，大家不仅“恨”不起来，相反，有的还被誉为“敢想敢干”的干部。
    “为大伙谋福利，过‘杠’也行。”近年来，上级有关部门曾三令五申，严禁滥发各种实物和补贴。但是，有些单位和部门仍然巧立名目，滥发奖金、补贴，公费过年、过节的现象时常可见。该讲的道理不讲了，该做的思想工作不做了，一味地把分钱、分物当作调动人们积极性的“灵丹妙药”。
    “上级不过紧日子，仿效就行。”提倡过紧日子，其必要性已逐渐被人们所认识。但一些单位和部门的日子却紧不起来，这与上级领导的表率作用不好有关。有的上级领导人只是在嘴上喊一喊，并不带头实行，结果下级纷纷仿效。上面日子紧一紧，下面就会缩一缩；上面日子松一松，下面就刮奢侈风。
    “集体研究决定，不行也行。”如今“集体违纪”时有所闻。如有的搞计划外基建工程，有的擅自购买小汽车，有的滥发各种实物补贴，当追查责任时，都是集体研究决定的。有的单位自以为有了集体研究决定这一前提，即使决策失误，但程序合法，因而为推脱责任找到了“充足理由”。即使上级追究时，也常常是雷声大，雨点小，板子举得老高，落下来很轻，且打不到具体人的屁股上。
    破除上述消极心态，自觉树立过紧日子的思想，需要做多方面的工作。要通过多种方式，深入进行艰苦奋斗教育，真正使人们认清国情，牢固地树立起勤俭建国、过紧日子的思想。各级领导应以身作则，率先垂范，不谋求政策规定以外的任何特权，不接受任何人给予的特殊关照，慎用手中权力，严守政策规定，以清正廉洁的形象，影响和感召群众。针对容易发生问题的薄弱环节，应建立健全各类经费的预决算制度、领导责任制度、检查监督制度和奖惩制度等，并认真付诸实施。
