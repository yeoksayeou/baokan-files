The curtain has risen on the construction of the Jungar Coalfield in Inner Mongolia, marking the beginning of a strategic shift in China's coalfield development from the east to the west. On the Ordos Plateau, new buildings are springing up, a 120-kilometer-long highway to Hohhot has been completed, a water supply capable of providing 10,000 tons per day has started, and a 220-kilovolt high-voltage power line is under construction.

The Jungar Coalfield is one of China's modern large-scale open-pit coal mines. Located in the eastern part of Jungar Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the coalfield has an explored area of 1,022 square kilometers, with reserves of 27.2 billion tons. It is easy to mine and has high-quality coal. Its completion will play a significant role in supporting the old, poor, and underdeveloped regions, promoting ethnic economies, and alleviating energy shortages in Northeast and North China.

The development of the Jungar Coalfield will be carried out in two phases, all designed and constructed by China. The first phase will commence next year, with a designed capacity of 12 million tons. Concurrently, a 200,000-kilowatt power plant and a 215-kilometer electrified railway will be built. The Jungar Coal Industry Company will oversee the unified planning, construction, management, and operation, breaking away from the past practice of constructing projects by industry. This is a new form of coal construction system reform.

    煤炭建设战略西移
    准格尔煤田投入开发
    首期工程设计能力逾一千万吨
    本报讯　记者刘燮阳报道：内蒙古准格尔煤田的建设序幕已经拉开，它标志着我国煤田开发由东部向西部开始战略转移。在鄂尔多斯高原上已出现了一栋栋崭新的楼房，通往呼和浩特的长达一百二十多公里的公路已修通，日供万吨水的水源已开始供水，二百千伏的高压输电线正在加紧建设。
    准格尔煤田是我国现代化大型露天煤矿之一，它位于内蒙古自治区准格尔旗东部，煤田已勘探面积一千零二十二平方公里，储量二百七十二亿吨，开采容易，煤质优良。它的建成对于支援老、少、穷地区，繁荣民族经济，缓解东北、华北地区能源短缺将起着重要的作用。
    准格尔煤田开发分两期进行，全部由我国自行设计和施工。一期工程明年正式开工，设计能力为一千二百万吨，同步建设的有二十万千瓦装机容量的电厂，二百一十五公里电气化铁路。由准格尔煤炭工业公司统一计划，统一建设，统一管理，统一经营，打破了过去按行业建设项目的作法，是煤炭建设体制改革的新形式。
