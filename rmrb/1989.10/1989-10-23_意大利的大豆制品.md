In the northern Italian city of Verona, a recent "European Food Expo" featured a stand showcasing fresh soybean products that caught the eye of attendees. People curiously sampled Western-style "soy milk," "soy yogurt," and "soy cheese"...

Westerners are accustomed to dairy products but are less familiar with soybean products. They associate soybean products with dairy products, referring to soy milk as "soy milk" and tofu as "soy cheese."

At the "Expo," Dr. Stefania Miriavaca, a technician from the Milan-based "Soy Pharmaceutical Company," told reporters that the company began researching soy-based foods six years ago. They have now successfully developed and started producing nearly 50 types of soy-based foods, which can be broadly categorized into two types: one type is powdered, packaged soy products such as soy flour and soy coffee powder; the other type is frozen foods, including eight varieties of tofu, eight varieties of soy yogurt, six varieties of soy milk, and various types of soy-based ice cream. These products began to be released into the Italian market starting last year.

Recently, an international academic conference on soybean products was held in Milan. Experts at the conference agreed that consuming more soybean products and reducing the intake of meat, butter, and dairy products can lower cholesterol levels and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases.

Experts estimate that if the consumption of soybean products can lower the average cholesterol level in Italians from the current 211 mg/L to 200 mg/L, approximately 10,000 lives could be saved each year. However, Italians generally prefer meat and dairy products, making it challenging to promote soy-based foods.

　　意大利的大豆制品
　　本报记者　罗晋标
    在意大利北方名城维罗纳最近举办的“欧洲食品博览会”上，一处新鲜的大豆制品展台引人注目，人们好奇地在这里品尝西式“豆奶”、“豆酸奶”、“豆奶酪”……
    西方人习惯吃奶制品，而对大豆制品比较陌生，他们把大豆制品同奶制品相联系，称豆浆为“豆奶”，豆腐为“豆奶酪”。
    在“博览会”上，意大利米兰“大豆药用公司”的技术员斯泰法尼娅·米里亚瓦卡博士告诉记者，该公司6年前开始研究大豆制食品，现在已经研制成功并投产近50种以大豆为基本原料的食品，大体上分为两大类：一类是粉末状袋装豆制品，如豆面粉、豆咖啡粉等；另一类是冷冻食品，其中有豆腐8种、豆酸奶8种、豆浆6种、豆制冰淇淋多种。上述品种已从去年起开始陆续投放意大利市场。
    不久前在米兰市召开了有关大豆制品的国际学术讨论会，与会专家认为，多食用大豆制品，减少食用肉类、黄油、奶制品，可以使人的胆固醇含量降低，减少心血管病的发生。
    有关专家估计，如果通过食用豆制品使意大利人目前的平均胆固醇含量211毫克／公升降低到200毫克／公升，那么每年将可挽救约1万人的生命。但意大利人喜欢吃肉和奶制品者为多，要推广大豆制食品，并非易事。
