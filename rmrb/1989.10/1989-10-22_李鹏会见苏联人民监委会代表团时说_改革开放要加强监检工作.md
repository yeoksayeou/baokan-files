Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 21st.

Premier Li Peng stated today that while carrying out reform and opening up, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and inspection work to ensure that those who violate laws and regulations are promptly investigated and dealt with, thereby guaranteeing the smooth progress of reform and opening up.

Li Peng made these remarks this afternoon when he met with a delegation from the Soviet People's Control Commission, led by Chairman Gennady Vasilyevich Kolbin.

Li Peng briefly introduced the situation of China's disciplinary inspection and supervision work to the guests. He said that China's disciplinary inspection and supervision work has three levels: party, government, and legal.

He mentioned that China's administrative supervision agencies were gradually established after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the new party leadership attached great importance to supervision work, resolutely and decisively grasped the construction of clean government, and made significant progress in supervision work, successfully handling several major cases.

He said, "We will continue to improve supervision work."

He emphasized that supervision work requires both means and authority. Supervision agencies have the power to directly handle cases of law and regulation violations once they are investigated and clarified.

The delegation from the Soviet People's Control Commission arrived in Beijing on October 19th at the invitation of China's Supervision Department for a 10-day visit to China.

　　李鹏会见苏联人民监委会代表团时说
　　改革开放要加强监检工作
    新华社北京10月21日电　国务院总理李鹏今天说，在改革开放的同时，要加强监检工作，使违法违纪的人和事及时受到查处，以保证改革开放的顺利进行。
    李鹏是在今天下午会见由主席根纳季·瓦西里耶维奇·科尔宾率领的苏联人民监察委员会代表团时说这番话的。
    李鹏向客人们简要地介绍了中国纪检和监察工作的情况。他说，中国的纪检和监察工作有党的、政府的和法律的三个层次。
    他说，中国的行政监察机构是党的十一届三中全会后逐步建立的。党的十三届四中全会后，党的新领导集体十分重视监察工作，坚决果断地抓廉政建设，监察工作很有起色，抓了几件大案的查处。
    他说：“我们将继续把监察工作做得更好。”
    他说，监察工作要有手段，有权力。监察机构有权在案件查清后，对违法违纪的人和事直接进行处理。
    苏联人民监察委员会代表团是应中国监察部的邀请于19日到达北京对中国进行为期10天的访问的。
