In the rugged mountains of western Anhui, nestled within the Dabie Mountains, lies a reservoir named Mozitan. The name Mozitan is rather peculiar. I imagine that the water in the reservoir must spin around the mountains like a millstone, hence the name. Don't believe it? Just look—water follows the mountains, and the mountains guide the water, endlessly winding and hiding. The mountains and water harmonize, creating a serene and tranquil scene. Since it's a millstone, there must be a sound. I imagine that the wind and rain are the millers, and on nights of heavy wind and rain, the raindrops patter on the leaves, and the "rumbling" sound of the millstone, accompanied by lightning, invades people's dreams.

The water of Mozitan is like a piece of silk dyed with indigo; it is like a piece of jade polished for thousands of years. It is so delicate that a few passing boats can unintentionally tear the silk into shreds; a gentle breeze can stir up ripples. Yet, it is also incredibly resilient, and even the most turbulent waves cannot leave any marks on the jade.

The mountains of Mozitan are sculpted by Nüwa. They are exquisite works of art, far more magnificent than any bonsai. Real mountains stand tall in the distance, and fake mountains are reflected in the water. Year after year, the real and fake mountains face each other like lovers. When a fisherman casts his net, no matter the catch, he is sure to shatter countless fake mountains. Fortunately, the fake mountains have the power to reform, and even if the fisherman had the perseverance of Yu Gong, his descendants would never be able to shatter the fake mountains. Thus, generation after generation of fishermen perish, but the green mountains endure.

The people of Mozitan embody the essence of the mountains and waters, with gentle temperaments and sweet voices. Among the sparse residents are workers, villagers, fishermen, artisans, merchants, and officials. Each has their own role, living and working in harmony. Everything seems so relaxed and peaceful, natural and beautiful. Merchants do not seek dishonest profits; when a few outsiders come, everyone curiously sticks their heads out to look; the mailman walks up and down the mountain paths for three hours every day; love letters travel over mountains and valleys, making lovers' hearts impatient, but love is steadfast. This is because the emotions of the mountain people are as deep and solid as the Dabie Mountains rooted in the mantle. After work, people cultivate fritillary bulbs, shiitake mushrooms, black ear mushrooms, and even carve out tea gardens, brewing "yellow buds" tea in the spring. In the city, these local specialties are considered treasures; to the mountain people, they are commonplace. Everyone says: What else can mountain people do?

Leaving Mozitan, I told Mozitan: I love you. The mountains, water, and people of Mozitan responded in unison: We love you too.

　　磨子潭的山水人
　　尹小奇
    在皖西大别山崇山峻岭之间有个水库叫磨子潭。磨子潭这个名字起得蹊跷，我想：其潭水定像磨子一样围着山转，由此得名。不信？你看，水随山行，山兜水走，不停地绕弯弯，捉迷藏。山水和谐，安宁静谧。既然是磨子，就一定有声响，我想：风雨就是推磨人，大风大雨之夜，雨点在树叶上淅沥，“隆隆”磨声伴着电光一道闯入人们梦乡。
    磨子潭的水是靛青染就的一块丝绸；是打磨了上千年的一块碧玉。它太娇嫩了，偶而滑过的一两只扁舟无意就把丝绸扯成一道道碎片；一股清风也能拂起轻微的涟漪。然而它又是如斯的坚韧，翻江倒海般的折腾也难给碧玉留下任何痕迹。
    磨子潭的山是女娲凿成的。好精致的盆景艺术，可远比盆景宏伟气魄。空间耸立一座座真山；水中倒映一座座假山。岁岁月月真山假山相对而视犹如情侣。打渔人一网撒下去，无论收获如何，准保能打碎可怜无数假山。好在假山有聚形术，打渔人那怕有愚公的勇气，子子孙孙干下去，却怎么也不能打碎假山。于是，死了一代代渔人而青山长存。
    磨子潭的人，钟山水之灵秀于一身，性情温和，音调甜美，为数不多的居民中有工人、山民、渔夫、手艺人、商人、干部，他们各司其职，安居乐业。一切显得那样舒缓沉静，自然和美。生意人不想赚昧心钱；稀巴巴来了外地人大家都好奇地伸头看看；邮递员每天照例在山路上颠扑三二小时；恋爱信穿山越岭能把情人的心给等焦了，爱情却很牢靠。因为山里人的感情和植根于地幔的大别山一样厚重扎实。工作之余，人们培育伏苓，香菇，黑木耳，甚至还劈出茶园，春来焙炒“黄芽”名茗。在城里这些土特产算得上珍品；山里人眼中倒是常物。大家都说：山里人，还能干什么。
    离开磨子潭，我对磨子潭说：我爱你。磨子潭的山、水、人齐声回应：我也爱你。
