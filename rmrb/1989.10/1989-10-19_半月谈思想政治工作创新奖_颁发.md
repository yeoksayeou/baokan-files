The award ceremony for the "Half-Monthly Talk" Innovation Award for Ideological and Political Work was held today in Beijing. Ten outstanding ideological and political workers from various fronts across the country were honored.

Wang Renshi, Minister of the Propaganda Department, pointed out at the meeting that ideological and political work should inherit past good traditions but also constantly improve and innovate to achieve good results. Through ideological and political work, we should educate the broad masses of cadres and the people in Marxism-Leninism, patriotism, self-reliance, and hard struggle, to mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of cadres and the people in building the Four Modernizations.

Wang Weicheng said at the meeting that these 10 award winners have done a very lively job in ideological and political work during the reform and opening up, and are worth learning from. We should carry forward the fine traditions of our Party's ideological and political work, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and oppose bourgeois liberalization.
