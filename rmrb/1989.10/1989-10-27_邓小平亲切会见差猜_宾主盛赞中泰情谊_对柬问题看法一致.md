Deng Xiaoping Warmly Meets Chatchai
Both Sides Praise Sino-Thai Friendship, Share Views on Cambodian Issue

BEIJING, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xiaoping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, today stressed that on the Cambodian issue, there are two solid and core problems: one is that Vietnam must completely and thoroughly withdraw its troops from Cambodia; the other is to establish a quadripartite interim coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Neither of these two issues can be faked. Both issues must be resolved simultaneously, and neither can be dropped.

Deng made the remarks when meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan. During the meeting, both sides focused on discussing the Cambodian issue.

Chatchai said that Thailand and China share completely consistent views on these two principles. This visit to China is to discuss with China how to supervise Vietnam's genuine withdrawal from Cambodia. The Thai government has consistently supported the establishment of a quadripartite coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.

Deng pointed out that on the Cambodian issue, there is an internal political issue and an issue of aggression, and the two should not be confused. The international community cannot tolerate aggression. ASEAN, Thailand, and China have made a common contribution to humanity on the Cambodian issue. China and Thailand both demand the restoration of Cambodia's independent, peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned status, and the end of Vietnam's aggression. In this regard, China and Thailand are in agreement. Deng explicitly stated that now, we must be vigilant against the possibility of the Afghan situation occurring in Cambodia.

The meeting was held in the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People. At 10 a.m., Deng came to the entrance of the hall and, with a smile, greeted Chatchai, who was walking towards him, saying, "Old friend, welcome!" The two shook hands and embraced warmly.

The 75-minute meeting was filled with a friendly atmosphere. Deng said to his "old friend," "You have been Prime Minister for a short time, but you have visited China twice. This shows the extraordinary friendly relations between China and Thailand. The relationship between China and Thailand is a model of friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems. The relationship between China and Thailand is truly good, not fake."

Chatchai said, "The relationship between Thailand and China is currently at its peak. The political, economic, and trade relations between the two countries are developing very well."

Deng said, "The development of Sino-Thai relations truly embodies the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. International relations should still adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. I recommend to foreign friends that in the long term, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should be used as the international political norm to guide relations between countries."

After concluding his two-day working visit to China, Chatchai and his delegation departed Beijing this evening to return home.

　　邓小平亲切会见差猜
　　宾主盛赞中泰情谊　对柬问题看法一致
    本报北京10月26日讯　记者温宪报道：中共中央军委主席邓小平今天强调说，在柬埔寨问题上，有两个扎扎实实的问题，也就是核心的问题，一个是越南必须干干净净、彻彻底底地从柬埔寨撤军；一个是建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。对这两个问题都不能弄虚作假。两个问题必须同时解决，丢掉哪一个都不行。
    邓小平是在会见泰国总理差猜时讲这番话的。在会见中，宾主重点讨论了柬埔寨问题。
    差猜说，泰中两国在这两个原则问题上有着完全一致的看法。这次来华就是要同中国商谈如何监督越南从柬埔寨真正撤军的问题。泰国政府一贯支持建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府。
    邓小平指出，在柬埔寨问题上，一个是内政问题，一个是侵略问题，两者不能混淆。国际社会不能容忍侵略。东盟、泰国、中国在柬埔寨问题上对人类做出了共同的贡献。中泰两国要求恢复柬埔寨独立、和平、中立、不结盟的地位，结束越南侵略。在这方面，中泰是一致的。邓小平明确表示，现在，我们要谨防一点，就是不要让阿富汗的事态在柬埔寨出现。
    会见在人民大会堂福建厅举行。上午10点，邓小平来到大厅门口，向迎面走来的差猜总理笑着大声说，“老朋友，欢迎你！”宾主热烈握手、拥抱。
    75分钟的会见充满友好气氛。邓小平对“老朋友”说，你当总理不久，就两次访问中国，这体现了中泰之间不平常的友好关系。中泰关系是不同社会制度国家之间友好合作的典范。中泰之间的关系是真好，不是假好。
    差猜说，泰中关系目前正处于高峰时期。两国之间的政治、经济、贸易关系都发展得很好。
    邓小平说：“中泰关系的发展是真正体现了和平共处五项原则。国际关系还是应该遵循和平共处五项原则。我向外国朋友推荐，在今后很长一段时期内，和平共处五项原则应该作为指导国与国之间关系的国际政治准则。”
    在结束了对中国两天的工作访问后，差猜总理一行今天傍晚离京回国。（附图片）
