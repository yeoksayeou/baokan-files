A Voice Dedicated to the Motherland
Beijing Broadcasting Institute, Qí Yuè

In the depths of my memory, there is a gleaming gem—40 years ago, on October 1st, I broadcasted the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China to the world.

That day, the sky over Beijing was clear and blue. The Tiananmen Gate, cleared of weeds and debris, was newly refurbished. In the afternoon, 300,000 people gathered on Chang'an Street and Tiananmen Square. Below the gate, the crowd was like a sea, and the flags were like waves. I and Comrade Dīng Yīlán stood at the broadcasting position on the west side of the gate, ready to conduct the first live broadcast in the history of China's radio. Facing such a grand historical scene, we had no experience and no rehearsal. Looking at the script in my hand, which was incomplete, we were both excited and nervous.

The minutes ticked by, and I stared intently at the staircase leading to the gate, waiting for the footsteps of the great leader. I knew that at this moment, hundreds of millions of Chinese people were gathered around their radios, waiting, waiting for a great historical voice. At 3:00 PM, the melody of "The East Is Red" played, and Chairman Mao's imposing figure appeared. I suppressed the surging emotions in my heart and immediately announced into the microphone: "Ladies and gentlemen, the ceremony to celebrate the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is about to begin. Now, Chairman Mao and his close comrades-in-arms Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and others are ascending Tiananmen Gate..." When Comrade Lín Bóqǔ announced the start of the ceremony, Chairman Mao's shoulders trembled slightly, and then that solemn and stirring voice rang out: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is established!" This voice, through the airwaves, spread across China and shook the world.

Tears streamed down my face—today's victory had overcome so many difficulties and obstacles! As the first male announcer to broadcast the Party's voice, I had a special feeling. During the battles with the Shaanxi-Ningxia New China Radio Station, I had read the historic document "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" over and over again. In the areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek, how many of our underground party members and the masses had risked their lives to listen to the Party's voice from the base area; during the all-out counterattack, I had read "Urging Du Yuming to Surrender," "Speech to the Huangwei Army Group," "The Final Warning"... I had experienced the joy of the People's Liberation Army sweeping away thousands of enemies like a broom—this unforgettable moment had solidified my lifelong pursuit: to serve the interests of the Party and the people with my personal interests, and to faithfully broadcast the voice of the Party and the people. I was ashamed of my past wavering—my request to change careers and become a translator; I was proud that I could participate in the cause of the people's liberation with my voice.

On the day of the founding ceremony, I and Dīng Yīlán stood in front of the microphone for more than 7 hours. At first, the editor kept prompting us, but later, the more we broadcasted, the smoother it became, and my voice did not feel tired at all.

An announcer uses his voice to convey the Party's voice and express the people's sentiments. In the early 1950s, after broadcasting Wei Wei's "Who Is the Most Beloved Person," letters poured into our small broadcasting room like snowflakes from the Korean battlefield. A soldier sent a captured parachute, saying in his letter: "During a bombardment, his comrade-in-arms sacrificed his life to protect the only radio in the company." He said, "Your voice made us feel that the Party and the people of the motherland were right behind us."

Today, if some listeners still remember the voice of Qí Yuè, then they will probably remember the luminous images that flashed in my voice: Chairman Mao's good soldier Lei Feng, the model county magistrate Jiaozhu Yulu, the vanguard of the working class Wang Jinxi, the people's good doctor Li Yuehua, the labor model Wu Jichang who fulfilled Premier Zhou's instructions, the Party's good daughter Zhang Zhixin who dedicated herself to the truth, the general Peng Da who dared to speak out for the people, and Premier Zhou who always had the people in his heart... As an announcer, I used my voice to recreate these vivid and luminous images and broadcast their spirits to the hearts of millions of people. What were those sleepless nights like? Moved by their spirits, I devoted my whole heart to my work. I had gone to the grassroots to experience life, had long conversations with authors and editors, and analyzed the script word by word, like a director analyzing a script. When I sat in front of the microphone, I forgot everything around me, as if I had completely merged with the great personalities. With their broad minds, my own mind was also purified. When my voice "collapsed," when tuberculosis plagued me, when I was sent to a labor reform camp during the Cultural Revolution... it was their spirits that encouraged me, supported me, and helped me overcome countless difficulties.

Not long after the Gang of Four was smashed, I recorded Jing Xizhen's memoir "By the Side of Marshal Peng." When I read about Marshal Peng Dehuai's plea for the people and his resolute march forward, the winds and rains of the Republic over the decades surged up in my heart, and I couldn't help but choke up and cry... Afterwards, I learned from the letters that many listeners also cried with me when they heard this part...

How much sorrow, how much joy; how much hardship, how much resilience; how much confusion, how much struggle... I have shared all these with the billions of Chinese people who are tenaciously fighting for a bright future with the heart of a child. I am proud that I have faithfully expressed the people's joys, sorrows, anger, and grief.

There are no rich works, no familiar images. Yes, I am just an announcer. What I have is my voice. But many people are familiar with my voice, which is the pride of an announcer. Who says that voice is intangible and fleeting! I firmly believe that the voice dedicated to the motherland, like seeds scattered across the land of China, will bloom into everlasting flowers.

专栏：共和国与我——国庆抒怀

    献给祖国的声音
    北京广播学院　齐越
    在记忆的积淀里，那是最亮最亮的一颗金珠——40年前的10月1日，我向全世界转播了中华人民共和国的开国大典。
    那天北京晴空万里，清除了杂草残砖的天安门城楼容颜一新。午后，30万游行队伍汇集东西长安街和天安门广场，城楼下人如海，旗如潮。我和丁一岚同志守候在城楼西侧的播音岗位上，即将进行我国人民广播史上第一次实况广播。面对如此宏大的历史场面，没有经验，也没有预演，看着手上已经写好的又很不完备的解说词，我们激动又感到紧张。
    时间一分一秒过去，我目不转睛地注视着登城的楼道，等待伟人的脚步声响起。我知道，此刻，亿万中国人正围拢在收音机旁凝神等待，等待着一个伟大的历史声音。下午3点整，《东方红》乐曲响起，毛主席魁伟的身影出现了。我按捺住心头的激荡，立即对着话筒播出：“各位听众，庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立典礼就要开始了。现在，毛主席和他的亲密战友朱德、周恩来、刘少奇等同志登上天安门城楼……”林伯渠同志宣布大典开始时，毛主席的双肩抖动了一下，随即，那个庄严激昂的声音响起了：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立了！”这个声音通过电波，传遍了中国，震撼着世界。
    热泪滚滚流下我的面颊——今天的胜利，跨越了多少艰难险阻！作为传播党的声音的第一个男播音员，我心中有着特别的感受。在随陕北新华广播电台辗转战斗的过程中，我曾一遍又一遍地播读历史性文件《目前的形势和我们的任务》，在当时蒋占区，有多少我党地下党员和群众曾冒着生命危险收听这来自根据地的党的声音；在全面大反攻时，我播读过《敦促杜聿明等投降书》、《向黄维兵团的讲话》、《最后的警告》……体味过人民解放军横扫千军如卷席的快乐——这终生难忘的时刻，坚定了我毕生的追求：以个人利益服从党和人民的利益，忠实地传播党和人民的声音。我羞愧，为我曾有的动摇——要求改行搞翻译的申请；我自豪，为我能以自己的声音参加人民解放的斗争事业。
    开国大典这一天，我和丁一岚对着话筒，足足站了7个多小时，开始，编辑在旁边不断提示，后来越播越流利，嗓子一点儿也不觉得累。
    播音员用声音传达党的声音，表达人民的心声。50年代初，我播出魏巍的《谁是最可爱的人》后，信件像雪片一样从朝鲜战场飞向我们小小的播音室。一位战士寄来了缴获的降落伞，他在信中说：一次炮击，他的战友为了保护连里唯一的一台收音机，牺牲了自己的生命。他说：“你的声音使我们感到党和祖国人民就在身后。”
    今天，如果有的听众还记得齐越的声音，那么，他大概会记得在我的声音中闪现的一个个光辉形象：毛主席的好战士雷锋、县委书记的榜样焦裕禄、工人阶级的先锋战士王进喜、人民的好医生李月华、为完成周总理的嘱托的劳模吴吉昌、为真理献身的党的好女儿张志新、敢为人民鼓与呼的彭大将军、心中永远装着人民的周总理……作为一个播音员，我用声音重塑着这些生动光辉的形象，把他们的精神播向千万人心间。那是怎样的一个个不眠之夜啊，为他们的精神感动着，我全身心地投入工作。我曾深入基层体验生活，与作者、编者促膝长谈，像导演分析剧本一样，逐字逐句推敲稿件中的每一个字句所表达的思想与情感。当我坐到话筒前时，我便忘却了周围的一切，仿佛完全与伟大的人格融化在一起了。有他们博大的心灵的感召，我自己的心灵也被淘洗了。当我嗓子“塌中”的时候、肺结核病缠身的时候、“文革”中被打入劳改队的时候……是他们的精神鼓励着我、支撑着我，帮助我克服了重重困难。
    粉碎“四人帮”以后不久，我播录了景希珍的回忆录《在彭总身边》，当播到彭德怀同志为民请命毅然前行时，共和国几十年的风风雨雨一起涌上心头，我不由得哽咽失声……事后，我从一封封来信中得知，许多听众听到这里，曾和我一起失声痛哭……
    几多哀痛，几多欢乐；几多磨难，几多不屈；几多茫然，几多奋起……这些，我都曾以赤子的心音与亿万为光明前程而顽强奋斗的中国人民共享，我为我曾经忠实地表达了人民的喜怒哀乐而自豪。
    没有丰殷的著作，没有人们熟悉的形象。是的，我只是一个播音员。我有的是声音。但许多人熟悉我的声音，这是一个播音员的骄傲。谁说声音是无形的、易逝的！我深深地相信，献给祖国的声音，如洒在神州大地的种子，将开出不败的鲜花。
