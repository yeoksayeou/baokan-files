Title: The Little Town's Flower Girl

Edition: 8

Nobody asks for her name or surname,
Nor is there any need to inquire.
She grows in the little town all year round.
The people of the little town
Call her peony in spring,
Jasmine in summer,
Chrysanthemum in autumn,
And plum blossom in winter.

In fact, she has many more names.
Call out any flower,
And she will respond without hesitation.
Even the famous actors in the opera world
Could not recite all the flower names for the twelve months.
She has grown up in the little town
And knows the preferences of the town's people over the recent years.
From the gaze of every townsperson,
She can bring out a vase or two of flowers,
And then use them to perfume the present day.

专栏：

　　小城卖花女
　　陶顺义
　　谁也不问她的名姓
　　也无须打听
　　她一年四季生长在小城
　　小城的人
　　春呼牡丹
　　夏唤米兰
　　秋称金菊
　　冬谓腊梅
　　其实她还有更多的芳名
　　随便叫出一种花
　　她都会毫不逊色的答应
　　就连戏曲界的名角儿
　　十二月花名也没能报全
　　她从小生长在小城
　　知道小城人近些年的喜好
　　她从小城人每一双目光里
　　都能端出一两盆花来
　　然后再用它去芳香今天
