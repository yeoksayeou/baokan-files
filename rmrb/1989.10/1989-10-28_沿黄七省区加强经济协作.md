A new era's "Yellow River Symphony" has begun to play, thanks to the joint efforts of the seven provinces along the Yellow River over the past year. Recently, leaders from the seven provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong gathered in Zhengzhou to collaborate and discuss strategies for this beautiful "symphony."

Since the establishment of the Yellow River Economic Cooperation Zone in July 1988, it has shown positive results. According to incomplete statistics, the seven provinces have signed over 400 economic and technological cooperation projects, exchanged nearly 1,000 personnel, and achieved a total trade volume of over 1 billion yuan. The most significant achievement of this cooperation is the deepening understanding of the importance of joint cooperation among the seven provinces, which has become increasingly self-aware. The joint development of domestic and international economic trade has had a good start, and the potential and prospects for developing an export-oriented economy within the cooperation zone have been seen. The formation of a regional economic structure with Yellow River characteristics has been explored. The theoretical discussion on the development prospects of the cooperation zone has also achieved certain results.

This time, the leaders of the Yellow River Economic Cooperation Zone provinces held their second meeting in Zhengzhou. They seriously discussed how to further strengthen economic and technological cooperation, resource development, internal and external trade, and tourism cooperation among the provinces along the Yellow River. They reached a consensus on the specific content of mutual cooperation: First, jointly develop resources, with the cooperation zone planning to develop coal, non-ferrous metals, tourism, and other resources, and jointly develop pillar industries such as transportation and electricity. Second, further strengthen the cooperation among industries, enterprises, and regions within the cooperation zone, and passed the "Proposal on Establishing the Yellow River Economic Cooperation Zone Industry Association." Third, continue to promote opening up and jointly develop an export-oriented economy. Fourth, jointly develop the market and passed the "Proposal on Organizing the Yellow River Economic Cooperation Zone Economic and Technological Trade Fair." Fifth, strengthen internal communication within the cooperation zone.

　　沿黄七省区加强经济协作
    本报郑州10月27日电　记者李而亮报道：一曲新时期的“黄河大合唱”，经过沿黄7省区1年的共同努力，已经奏响序曲。近日，沿黄青海、甘肃、宁夏、陕西、山西、河南、山东7省区的有关领导会聚郑州，为谱写这部美妙的“乐曲”通力合作，共商大计。
    沿黄经济协作带1988年7月建立以来，显示出良好效果。据不完全统计，7省区共签订经济技术协作项目400多项，人才交流近1000人次，物资协作总金额10亿多元。而协作最重要的收获，则是从深层的意义上体现的：7省区对联合协作意义认识日益提高，行动逐步自觉；共同发展国内外经济贸易有了良好开端，看到了协作带共同发展外向型经济的潜力和前景，为形成有黄河流域特色的经济贸易探索了路子；协作带内行业联合逐步展开，一个纵向多层次，横向多网络的区域经济整体结构正在逐步形成；对协作带发展前景的理论探讨取得了一定成果。
    这次，沿黄经济协作带省区负责人在郑州召开第二次会议，就如何进一步加强沿黄省区间经济技术协作、资源开发、内外贸易及旅游业的全面合作，进行了认真探讨，并在相互协作的具体内容上取得一致性意见：一、联合开发资源，由协作带有计划开发煤炭、有色金属、旅游等资源，联合发展交通、电力等支柱产业；二、进一步加强协作带内行业、企业、地区间的联合协作，通过了《关于组建黄河经济协作带行业协会的提案》；三、继续推进对外开放、联合发展外向型经济；四、共同开发市场，通过了《关于组织黄河经济协作带经济技术交易会的提案》；五、加强协作带内部联络。
