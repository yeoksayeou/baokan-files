From Buenos Aires, traveling north for 120 kilometers, one arrives at the famous hometown of the gauchos, San Antonio de Areco. In the 16th century, Spanish colonial forces conquered the indigenous people here, and the royal decree to build the Royal Road became a necessary route from La Plata to Upper Peru (now Bolivia). In the early 19th century, during Argentina's war of independence, national hero General San Martin and his troops passed through here on their way to the Battle of San Lorenzo. Today, this ancient and simple town has been renovated and joined the ranks of the tourism industry. The rose-colored houses in the city, the gaucho museum in the suburbs, and some estate hotels attract an increasing number of tourists. People leave the bustling metropolis to spend a few days in this quiet place, enjoying a pastoral life, experiencing the pleasures of rural living, and learning about the pure traditions of the locals.

The owners of the estates have transformed their previously idle houses into hotels that embody the rural way of life, ranging from Italian-style villas to French-style castles. With warm and attentive service, these estate hotels are highly popular. The fees are determined by the size of the rooms, the value of the furniture, and the quality of the wine served, ranging from $100 to $600 for a weekend stay. In addition to accommodation and meals, guests can enjoy horseback riding, swimming pools, golf courses, and tennis at nearby clubs.

The Estancia Alardo has eight rooms with bathrooms. Inside, a marble fireplace is adorned with a guitar, and the furniture and decorations retain the style of the colonial era. The estate's environment preserves the style of its former owners. Under the orange trees, there are wooden chairs on the green lawn for relaxation. Not far away, there is an old watchtower, and a windmill slowly turns in the breeze, with a few horses grazing leisurely. When guests arrive, a group of gauchos on horseback welcome them at the estate's entrance gate. These rugged cowboys then perform thrilling equestrian shows for the tourists. Now, this estate hotel is bustling with business, and those who wish to spend the weekend here need to book in advance.

The Estancia Potreria was once the residence of Ricardo Güiraldes, a famous writer known for his depictions of gaucho life. It has since been converted into a gaucho museum, helping visitors understand the history, lifestyle, and customs of Argentine gauchos. Not far from the main building, a small inn has been reconstructed, which was a gathering and entertainment place for gauchos and cowboys. Several wax figures recreate the appearance of gauchos from the past: an elderly man pouring wine for guests, a young couple whispering sweet nothings. Outside the exhibition hall, there is a horse-drawn mill, a well, and shoes made from sheep bones. At the exit, there is a round tower for keeping pigeons.

Argentine authorities are promoting diverse tourism routes to attract visitors. Proponents of estate tourism believe that not only can many estates on the Pampas plains be used for tourism development, but from the northern Salta to the southern Tierra del Fuego, there are estates in various regions that can be utilized. This approach requires little investment, can protect some valuable estates, and promote the development of the domestic tourism industry, achieving multiple benefits at once.

    独具魅力的庄园旅游
    管彦忠
    从布宜诺斯艾利斯北行一百二十公里，便到达有名的高乔人故乡圣安东尼奥·德阿雷科。十六世纪西班牙殖民军在这里征服过印第安人，西班牙王室下令在此修筑的皇家大道成为拉普拉塔通往上秘鲁（今玻利维亚）的必经之地。十九世纪初阿根廷独立战争中，民族英雄圣马丁将军和他率领的部队经过这儿，奔向圣洛伦索战场。如今，这座古老而简朴的小城装扮一新，加入了旅游业的阵容。市区古玫瑰色的房舍、郊区的高乔人博物馆和一些庄园旅馆吸引着越来越多的游客。人们离开喧闹嘈杂的大都市，希望在这个宁静的地方度过周末，过几天田园诗一般的日子，体验乡村生活的乐趣，了解当地人纯朴的传统。
    庄园的主人们把本来空闲的房子装修后，变为体现乡村生活方式的旅馆，其中有意大利别墅式的，也有法国城堡式的。加上热情周到的服务，庄园旅馆深受欢迎。收费根据房间的大小及颜色、家具的价值和饮用的葡萄酒质量而定，周末两天收一百至六百美元不等。除了吃、住，旅客还可以骑马游览、使用游泳池和高尔夫球场等设施，或到附近的俱乐部去打网球。
    阿尔道庄园有八个带浴室的房间。室内大理石的壁炉旁边挂着一把吉他，家具陈设和装饰保留着殖民时代的式样。庄园的环境保持了过去主人居住时的风格。桔子树下绿草坪上摆着供人纳凉的木头椅子，不远处有老式的瞭望塔，汲水的风车在微风中缓缓转动，几匹马儿在安闲地吃草。当客人到达时，一群高乔人骑着马在庄园入口的栅栏处迎候，随后这些剽悍的草原牧民为游客表演精彩的骑术。如今，这家庄园旅馆生意兴隆，想到这里度周末的人需要事先预订房间。
    波特尼亚庄园曾经是以描写高乔人生活著名的作家里卡多·古依拉德斯的住宅，后辟为高乔人博物馆，帮助观众了解阿根廷高乔人的历史、生活方式与习俗。离主建筑不远，重建了一座小酒店，这是高乔人及牧人聚会和消遣的地方。几个蜡人塑像再现了昔日高乔人的风貌：一位老者在为客人倒酒，一对青年男女在悄诉衷肠。展室外还有一台马拉磨面机、一口水井及用羊骨头做成的鞋，出口处有一个养鸽的圆塔。
    阿根廷有关部门通过旅游途径多样化来吸引游人。主张发展庄园旅游的人士认为，不仅潘帕平原上的许多庄园可以用来发展旅游，而且从北部的萨尔塔到南端的火地岛，各地都有可以利用的庄园。这样做花钱不多，既可保护一些有价值的庄园，又能促进国内旅游业的发展，真是一举数得。
