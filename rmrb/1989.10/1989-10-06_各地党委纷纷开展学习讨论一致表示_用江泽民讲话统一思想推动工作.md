Party committees in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government have held meetings in recent days to study Jiang Zemin's important speech at the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic. All agree that they should use the spirit of Jiang Zemin's speech to unify the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, to more consciously adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and the policy of reform and opening up, to firmly walk the socialist road, and to promote all work.

Delegates attending the enlarged meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee believed that this speech is a guiding document for unifying the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, raising awareness, and doing a good job. It is a result of thinking about the past and the future according to Deng Xiaoping's opinions. The speech proposed ten major relationships in the new situation, which have important practical and historical significance for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Provincial Party Secretary Jiang Chunyun said that Jiang Zemin's speech is an important Marxist document. It scientifically summarizes the 40-year course of the country's founding with clear Marxist-Leninist views, summarizes four basic experiences, and deeply expounds on ten major issues for the future. It is dialectical, scientific, and practical. By following this speech, we will better complete the four tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

At the enlarged meeting held by the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, it was believed that Jiang Zemin's speech is a powerful ideological weapon for unifying understanding. Provincial Party Secretary He Bukan said that through study, we must first solve ideological problems. On some major issues, such as views on stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, views on reform and opening up, views on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, etc., we must truly unify our understanding with the spirit of the Party Central Committee, to invigorate the spirit, unite as one, strive hard, and push the modernization construction cause forward.

An Hui Provincial Party Secretary Lu Rongjing said that Jiang Zemin's speech expounds on the domestic and foreign policies of our Party and country, answering a series of major questions that people are concerned about, and is a guiding document for work.

Zhejiang Provincial Party Secretary Li Zemin said that this speech is a sign of our Party's political maturity. He summarized the issues involved in the study and discussion, emphasizing the need to focus on several relationship issues for in-depth discussion, and on the basis of in-depth study and investigation, to scientifically and correctly summarize experiences and lessons, and to straighten out the guiding ideology.

Party and government leaders at various levels believe that Jiang Zemin's speech emphasizes the stability and continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, clarifies ideological confusion, unifies understanding, and stabilizes people's minds. Party organizations at all levels should deeply understand the spirit of Jiang Zemin's speech and use the spirit of the speech to promote all work. Currently, it is especially important to focus on Party building, economic work, and ideological education.

Heilongjiang Provincial Party Secretary Sun Weiben said in the study and discussion that Jiang Zemin's speech is both a scientific summary of our Party and country's 40-year history and a correct guide for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must firmly remember and deeply understand the four basic conclusions summarized by Jiang Zemin, to clarify the Party's basic theory that has been confused by the rampant bourgeois liberalization in recent years, to firmly adhere to one center and two basic points, to unite as one, to consolidate and develop the victory of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, to consolidate and develop the political situation of stability and unity, and to strive to achieve stable development of the national economy.

Gansu Provincial Party Secretary Li Zichi said that the ten important issues raised by Jiang Zemin in the report involve our Party's past, present, and future, involve all sectors, and the scope is particularly broad, and the issues expounded are particularly profound. We must repeatedly and seriously study and understand them.

In the study, various places also conducted specific research and deployment on the study of Jiang Zemin's speech. The Gansu Provincial Party Committee issued a notice requiring various places to adopt forms such as discussion meetings, symposiums, reports, and holding study classes to seriously understand the spirit of the speech. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee recently decided that all levels of Party organizations in the province, especially leading cadres at the county level and above, must seriously implement and implement this guiding document. The Jilin Provincial Party Committee requires various places to truly link up with reality in the study, to solve some ideological and practical problems in reform and construction.

Delegates attending the enlarged meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee expressed that they would use the spirit of the speech to guide all work, to consolidate and develop Shanghai's stable and united political situation, and to further develop Shanghai's economy. Municipal Party Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji said that Jiang Zemin visited Shanghai in early August, hoping that Shanghai would further activate large and medium-sized enterprises and expand opening up. He pointed out that Shanghai's position in the national economic construction is crucial, and through deepening reform and rectification and comprehensive management, we must do everything possible to develop Shanghai's economy. Zhu Rongji said that we are determined to complete the tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee and the State Council and to make more contributions to the country.
