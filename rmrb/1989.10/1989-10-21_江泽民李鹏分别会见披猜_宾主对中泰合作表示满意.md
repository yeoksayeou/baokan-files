	BEIJING, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- By Wen Xian

	Premier Li Peng met with Thai Deputy Prime Minister Pichai Ratanakul Seri and his delegation at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this evening.

	Last year, when Premier Li Peng visited Thailand, Pichai served as the chairman of the reception committee and made great efforts to ensure the success of Li Peng's visit. Li Peng once again expressed his gratitude to Pichai.

	Li Peng told the Thai guests, "You can walk freely on the streets of Beijing and visit any tourist spot. You can see for yourselves that the situation in China is stable."

	When introducing China's economic situation, Li Peng said, "The good aspect of China's economy is that inflation has significantly decreased, currency circulation is better, and the financial situation is stable. This allows our economy to develop in a more reasonable direction."

	He said, "Currently, we do face some difficulties in the economy, with the development speed slowing down and the market becoming sluggish. However, this also provides an opportunity for our enterprises to adjust, improve product quality, and increase varieties. China's economy will not shrink as some Westerners have predicted."

	He emphasized, "Doing business and making investments are mutually beneficial for both sides, not just beneficial for one side. Some Western countries are putting pressure on China and imposing economic sanctions, which will cause us some difficulties, but the impact is not significant. China has strong resilience. We will not close the door to openness, but now some Western countries want to close their doors to China. This situation will not last long. We are willing to develop relations, including economic relations, with them on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

	Li Peng praised Thailand as one of China's most friendly neighbors. He said, "We are willing to strengthen cooperation with Thailand in various fields, including economics and trade."

	Deputy Prime Minister Pichai said, "Thailand has always believed that the events that took place in Beijing in June this year are China's internal affairs, and foreign countries have no right to interfere. Thailand is willing to continue to develop cooperation with China in various fields."

	After the meeting, Li Peng hosted a banquet to entertain the Thai friends. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and others attended the meeting and banquet.

　　江泽民李鹏分别会见披猜
　　宾主对中泰合作表示满意
    新华社北京10月20日电  中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在中南海会见了应邀来访的泰国副总理披猜·拉达军一行，双方进行了亲切友好的谈话。
    江泽民和披猜对中泰两国建交以来在各方面友好合作关系的发展表示满意。
    江泽民感谢泰国政府、差猜总理对中国平息反革命暴乱所采取的同情和支持的态度。
    本报北京10月20日讯　记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今天晚上在钓鱼台国宾馆会见了泰国副总理披猜·拉达军及其一行。
    去年李鹏总理访问泰国时，披猜任接待委员会主席，为李鹏访泰的成功做出了很大的努力。对此，李鹏再次向披猜表示感谢。
    李鹏对泰国客人说，诸位在北京可以随便到街上去走一走，任何一个旅游点都可以去。你们可以证明中国的局势是稳定的。
    在向客人介绍中国经济形势时，李鹏说，中国经济好的方面是通货膨胀明显下降，货币回笼比较好，金融是稳定的，这使得我们的经济能够向更加合理的方向发展。
    他说，当前我们在经济方面是有一些困难，发展速度降下来了，市场疲软。但是这也为我们的企业进行调整、提高产品质量和增加花色品种提供了机会。中国经济决不会像有些西方人士所预言的那样会出现萎缩。
    他强调说，做生意，搞投资，都是双方互利的，绝不是只对一方有利。有些西方国家对中国施加压力，进行经济制裁，这会给我们造成一些困难，但是作用并不大。中国抗压的能力是很强的。我们自己不会把开放的大门关上，但是，现在有些西方国家想关上他们对中国的大门。这种情况是不会持久的。我们愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上同他们发展关系，包括经济关系。
    李鹏称赞泰国是中国最友好的邻邦之一。他说，我们愿在各个方面，包括经济、贸易领域同泰国加强合作。
    披猜副总理表示，泰国一直认为，今年6月在北京发生的事情是中国的内政，外国无权干涉。泰国愿意继续发展同中国在各个方面的合作。
    会见后，李鹏设宴招待泰国朋友。外交部长钱其琛等参加了会见和宴请。
