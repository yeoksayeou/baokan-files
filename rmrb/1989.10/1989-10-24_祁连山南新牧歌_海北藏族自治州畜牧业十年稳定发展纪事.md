    Mid-autumn, I entered the Qilian Mountains, known as "China's Ural." To the south of Qilian, the snow lies like white hadas. Below the snow line, hundreds of thousands of acres of fenced grasslands are like golden wheat fields. Young men on motorcycles and girls on fine horses, laughing and carrying tents and provisions, are driving their fat cattle and sheep from the summer pastures to the autumn pastures...

    In Haomen Town, the capital of Hai Bei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Tibetan Deputy Governor Zhihua told me, "Despite the spring cold and snow disasters this year, the livestock carrying capacity in summer and autumn still reached 3.16 million head, with a total increase of 28.5%. The livestock industry in the windy and snowy Hai Bei has reached its best level in history since 1980."

    "The Herdsmen Are Truly Happy Under the Leadership of the Communist Party"

    From historical records, I learned that the livestock industry in Hai Bei Prefecture had long been in a state of stagnation; from 1970 to 1979, the year-end livestock inventory fluctuated between 1.73 million and 2.39 million head (only), with consistently low total growth rate, slaughter rate, commercial rate, and lamb survival rate, and high adult livestock mortality rate. The snow disasters in winter 1985 and this spring did not spare Hai Bei, but the fluctuations have disappeared in these two years.

    This county is located at an altitude of 3,200 to over 4,000 meters, on the northwest side of Qinghai Lake. The most severely affected area this year was Quanji Township. Party Secretary Jia Yucang said, "Last autumn and this spring, the township distributed 600,000 kilograms of feed, 290,000 kilograms more than in 1987. We conducted two rounds of vaccination and deworming, followed by spraying insecticides and adjusting pastures. Unexpectedly, from late March to April, it snowed every other day, with the deepest snow reaching over a meter. The five pastoral villages with 120,000 head of livestock were all trapped in the winter pens around the lake. For four days and nights, it rained, snowed, and blew, killing 13,529 young livestock and injuring 4,139 adult livestock. We rode horses down to the villages, but the snow was too deep for the horses to walk, so we waded through the snow. The herdsmen had used their food as feed. We quickly gathered 91 tractors and trucks from various farming and feeding teams and nearby farms. On the snowy plains, large trucks led the way and small trucks followed, with cows carrying people and students delivering. In three days, we delivered 530,000 kilograms of feed and grain, and over a thousand kilograms of food, easing the disaster. This year, the young livestock task was also overfulfilled by 122 head."

    In early July, heavy rains hit the Mule Pasture, causing floods that destroyed six sections of the Hotian Road across Mule, washing away 18,900 cubic meters of soil and stones. Early-arriving herdsmen ran out of food and firewood, making it difficult to carry out mechanical shearing, and livestock products piled up. At this time, the various command centers on the mountain went deep into the pastoral households to solve their problems, while the county party secretary and county magistrates dispatched 60 cadres from below the mountain to mobilize manpower and machinery to repair the roads. Several dozen cadres from Yikewulan and Quanji Townships also carried shovels, picks, and tens of thousands of kilograms of grain feed, flour, and barley, entering the Wayan Mountains to clear the way. The desperate herdsmen said, "The herdsmen are truly happy under the leadership of the Communist Party."

    "Only Reform Can Improve the Level of Livestock Production"

    Yaks, Haomen horses, and plateau Tibetan sheep are livestock that have been domesticated by the Qiang and Tujue people who have roamed Hai Bei for generations. To this day, people still proudly call yaks the "ships of the snow mountains" and Haomen horses the "dragon foals."

    Contemporary Hai Bei people, in order to revitalize the national economy, dare to break the old traditions. In the improvement of cattle, horses, and sheep, they have made outstanding achievements. The crossbreeding of Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, Tsegye sheep, Romney Marsh sheep, and Haiyan Tibetan sheep has been going on for over 30 years, and the "Qinghai semi-fine wool sheep," which is both wool and meat, has been bred throughout the province.

    Qilian is the county where the "Xining wool" breed of Tibetan sheep is preserved, and it is also making efforts to reform for benefits. The approach is from the average altitude of 3,600 meters in the Eba Township. When asked about the "Eba experience," the simple-minded township party secretary, Gaisoba, said, "In the past, Tibetan people were reluctant to sell livestock, killing only 20 or so cattle and sheep each year, and the old livestock often died in winter and spring, leaving only a few skins. In 1979, the per capita income was only 210 yuan. In 1980, a few households in Huangcaogou separately grouped the thin, old, sick, disabled, poor-quality, and winter-unfit livestock, fattening them for 100 days in the winter and summer pastures, and then handing them over for sale. This way, the herdsmen increased their income and reduced the pressure on the grasslands. Then, some herdsmen implemented the fattening and selling of lambs; reduced the death of adult livestock, and increased the proportion of female livestock. These are the three steps."

    Coming out of Eba, I realized that the transformation of livestock industry from quantity to efficiency, from traditional to modern, and from natural economy to commodity economy requires a lot of courage and practice.

    Officials and the Masses Show Selflessness

    Year after year, the Hai Bei people first think of the party and the state that have brought them good policies and good lives. In less than 10 years, the entire prefecture has sold 3.73 million head (only) of livestock to the state, with an average annual commercial rate of 15.5%, more than double that of the previous 10 years. At the same time, the annual sale of sheep wool reached 1.5 million kilograms, and leather hides reached 500,000 pieces, both significantly higher than in the previous 10 years.

    In the home of party member Riluo in Yihemao Village, I deeply felt that today's herdsmen have a broader mind than Qinghai Lake. Riluo's wife, Dajiqima, smilingly told me in Tibetan, "The herdsmen are all rich, thanks to the party's good policies. Last year, he sold 1,500 kilograms of sheep wool, exceeding the quota by 530.7 kilograms, all at the state's set price, which is 2,800 yuan less than private purchases; this year, he has already sold 1,416 kilograms, again exceeding the quota by 600 kilograms. Our family has enough to eat and wear, and we should think more about the state's difficulties."

    When talking with state committee secretary Quzhuoma, I found that the prefecture and county officials have the same precious spirit of selflessness as their own herdsmen brothers. Quzhuoma has worked in Hai Bei for 28 years. In the past, he rode horses through every mountain and river, but now the roads between counties and townships are smooth, and he requires the prefecture and county standing committees to establish a point-responsibility system, with township officials taking charge of villages. The prefecture's livestock industry has had a bumper harvest for ten years, but Quzhuoma said, "By the end of September this year, we have purchased 1.47 million kilograms of sheep wool, completing 98% of the task. The province will also come to the prefecture to hold a livestock celebration meeting. But we are thinking about how to achieve stable development in the next 10 years. In 1990 and during the 'Eighth Five-Year Plan' period, we will reach five new levels in pastoral livestock production, agricultural livestock, production conditions, service work, and herdsmen's lives, and we will also let the 'eight treasures' of Qilian Mountain jump out of the mountains."

　　祁连山南新牧歌
　　——海北藏族自治州畜牧业十年稳定发展纪事
　　本报记者　郅振璞
    中秋时节，我走进被称为“中国乌拉尔”的祁连山。祁连山南，白雪像条条哈达。雪线下，数百万亩分隔围栏里秋草如禾。驾摩托的小伙，策骏马的姑娘，欢笑地携带帐篷衣粮，赶着肥壮的牦牛、羊群，正由夏季草山转往秋季草场……
    在海北藏族自治州府浩门镇，藏族副州长智华对我说：“尽管今年春寒雪灾，夏秋载畜量仍达316万头，总增率28.5％。风霜雪冻的海北牧业，1980年以来的10年，创了历史最好水平。”
    “共产党领导下的牧民真幸福”
    我从史料中获悉：海北州畜牧业长期处于徘徊停滞状态；1970年至1979年的十年间，年末存栏牲畜在173万至239万头
  （只）之间涨落，一直是总增率、出栏率、商品率、仔畜繁活率低，成畜损亡率高。1985年冬季雪灾、今年春寒雪灾并未放过海北，不过这两年涨落现象不见了。
    这个县海拔3200米至4000多米，在青海湖西北侧。今年灾情最重的是泉吉乡，党委书记贾玉仓说：“去秋今春乡里落实饲草60万公斤，比1987年多29万公斤，两次防疫驱虫，接着喷雾杀虫、调剂草场。谁知3月底到4月，隔天一场雪，最厚的地方1米多，5个牧业村12万头牲畜都困在环湖冬窝子里，有四天四夜，又是雨，又是雪，又是风，仔畜死了13529头（只），成畜损了4139头。我们分头骑马下去，雪太深，马不走，我们就趟雪进村，牧民们的口粮都当饲料了。我们赶紧从各农饲队和附近农场集中91辆拖拉机和汽车，雪野上大车开路小车跟，牛驮人背学生送。三天就送了53万公斤饲草饲料、上千斤粮食，缓和了灾情。今年仔畜任务还超额122头哩。”
    7月上旬，默勒牧场连降大雨，山洪暴发，横贯默勒的热江公路，6处被大水冲毁，流失土石18900立方。早来的牧民粮尽柴绝，机械剪毛难以开展，羊毛等畜产品积成堆。这时，山上各指挥部深入牧业户排忧解难，山下县委书记和县长们抽调60名干部，调动人力、机械上山抢修公路。伊克乌兰和泉吉两乡几十名干部，也带着锨镐工具和数万斤颗粒饲料、白面、青稞，排险进入瓦岩山。绝望中的牧民感动地说：“共产党领导下的牧民真幸福啊。”
    “只有改革，才能提高牧业生产层次”
    牦牛、浩门马、草地型藏羊，是先后游牧在海北的羌人、吐谷浑人从野畜类长期驯养而来的。至今人们还自豪地称牦牛为“雪山之舟”、浩门马为“龙驹”。
    当代海北人为振兴民族经济，敢打破老祖宗留下的坛坛罐罐。在牛、马、羊的改良中，他们做出了突出成绩。新疆细毛羊、茨盖羊、罗姆尼玛许半细毛羊和海晏藏羊“结亲”已30多年，毛肉兼用的“青海半细毛羊”已由此繁衍全省。
    祁连是“西宁毛”品种藏系羊保留县，也在着力改革出效益。路子是从平均海拔3600米的峨堡乡趟出来的。问起“峨堡经验”，憨厚的乡党委书记尕索巴说：“过去藏族惜售牲畜，每年就宰杀20来只牛羊吃，其它老畜往往冬瘦春死亡，落不下几张皮，1979年人均收入才210元。1980年黄草沟几户，把各家瘦、老、病、残、毛质差、过不了冬的牲畜单独组群，七至十月在冬夏草场结合处百日育肥，再上交出售。这样，牧民增收，还减轻草原压力。接着又有牧民实施羯羔育肥出售或屠宰；减少成畜死亡，提高母畜比例。就这三条。”
    从峨堡出来，我体会到，畜牧业由数量型到效益型，从传统型到现代型，从自然经济到商品经济，实现这三个转变，要有多少勇气和实践啊。
    干群讲奉献
    连年牧业丰收，海北人首先想到的是给他们送来好政策、好生活的党和国家。不到10年，全州已交售国家373万头（只）牲畜，年商品率平均15.5％，是前10年的一倍多。同时，年售羊毛150万公斤，皮张50万张，也大大高于前十年。
    在冶合茂村党员俄日洛家，我深感今日牧民胸怀比青海湖还宽广。俄日洛的妻子达日卓玛在客厅笑吟吟地用藏语告诉我：“牧民都富了，多亏党的好政策，去年他交售羊毛1500斤，超额任务530.7斤，全按国家排价，比私人收购要少得2800元；今年已交1416斤，又超额任务600斤。我家吃穿不缺，得多想想国家的难处。”
    在同州委书记卓玛交谈感受时，我发现州、县干部同自己牧民兄弟一样，富有可贵的奉献精神。卓玛在海北工作28年了，当年骑马走遍山山水水，现在县乡之间道路畅通，他要求州、县常委建立联点责任制，乡干部包片驻村。全州牧业十年丰收，可卓玛说：“今年9月底，我们已收购羊毛147万公斤，完成任务的98％。省里还要来州上开畜牧庆功会。我们却在想如何取得下个10年的稳定发展，1990年和‘八五’期间，要上牧区牧业生产、农区畜牧业、生产条件、服务工作和牧民生活五个新水平，还要让祁连山的‘八宝’都跳出山门。”
