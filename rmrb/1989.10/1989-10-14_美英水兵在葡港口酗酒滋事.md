U.S. and British sailors caused disturbances in the port of Lisbon late on October 11th while intoxicated, resulting in several injuries.

According to Portuguese police, the incident was initiated by five American sailors. They started by arguing while drunk and then proceeded to fight with weapons. The situation escalated to involve hundreds of American and British sailors, who gathered to cause trouble. Apart from fighting among themselves, they threw stones and empty bottles at passing vehicles and smashed the windows of shops. This severe disruption of public order angered the citizens of Lisbon.

After the incident, a large number of Portuguese police rushed to the scene to stop the disturbance and detained several of the intoxicated sailors. However, this did not calm the situation. Therefore, the Portuguese police had to fire warning shots and detained over 100 more sailors. Later, these sailors were escorted back to their respective warships by Portuguese police and their own military officers.

The troublemakers were from a British aircraft carrier and three U.S. warships docked in the port of Lisbon. The incident resulted in injuries to one Portuguese police officer, one Lisbon citizen, and several foreigners.

    美英水兵在葡港口酗酒滋事
    新华社里斯本10月12日电（记者刘大龙）美、英两国水兵11日晚在里斯本港口附近酗酒滋事，造成数人受伤。
    据葡萄牙警方透露，骚乱事件是由5名美国水兵引起的。他们先是酒后争吵，接着便手持凶器斗殴。最后发展到数百名美国和英国水兵卷入进来，聚众闹事。他们除相互殴斗外，还用石头和空酒瓶袭击过往车辆，并打碎商店的玻璃。这种严重扰乱社会秩序的行为引起了里斯本市民的气愤。
    事件发生后，葡萄牙大批警察赶到现场制止闹事，扣留了数名酗酒闹事的水兵，但并未能使事态平息下来。因此，葡警察只好鸣枪示警，并又拘留了100多名水兵。事后，这些水兵在葡方警察及本国军官的看护下返回了各自的军舰。
    闹事的水兵分别来自停泊在里斯本港口的一艘英国航空母舰和3艘美国军舰。事件中有1名葡方警察、1名里斯本市民及数名外国人受伤。
