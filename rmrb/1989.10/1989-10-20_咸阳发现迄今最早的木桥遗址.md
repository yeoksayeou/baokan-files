The oldest and largest wooden bridge site from the Western Han Dynasty discovered both domestically and internationally has been found in the ancient riverbed of the Sha River, located 8 kilometers south of Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province. The ancient bridge consists of two sections.

According to experts, the first bridge pier dates back over 2,100 years and is likely the remains of the ancient Xiwei Bridge, a crucial crossing on the ancient Silk Road.

    本报西安电　记者孟西安报道：国内外迄今年代最久远、规模宏大的西汉木桥遗址，在陕西省咸阳市南8公里处的沙河古河道内发现。古桥分为两座。
    据专家测定，一号桥桩距今已2100余年，很可能是古丝绸之路必经的西渭桥遗址。
