Li Tieying Visits Ice Heart and Zang Kejia
Congratulates Two Literary Elders on Their Birthdays

BEIJING, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) -- Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor Li Tieying recently visited the residences of Ice Heart and Zang Kejia, two literary elders.

During the season of fragrant osmanthus, Ice Heart celebrated her 90th birthday. On October 5, Li Tieying brought a potted osmanthus to wish the elderly woman good health. He toasted to this century's contemporary, praising Ice Heart as a writer who emerged during the May Fourth New Culture Movement and has never stopped her literary career for 70 years. He and Ice Heart chatted about daily life, from indoor flower cultivation to daily routines, and also discussed education and intellectual issues that they both care about.

Today, Zang Kejia, who is celebrating his 85th birthday, welcomed Li Tieying in his small courtyard in the afternoon. The gift he received was a potted kumquat. Although it was their first meeting, Li Tieying warmly held the poet's hand and said that he had long been a reader of his works. Zang Kejia happily recited a new poem he had written, and also talked about his revolutionary experiences in his early years and his friendship with the older generation of revolutionaries.

Acting Minister of Culture He Jingzhi accompanied Li Tieying to visit Ice Heart and Zang Kejia.

    李铁映看望冰心臧克家
    向两位文学界前辈祝贺寿辰
    新华社北京10月7日电　中共中央政治局委员、国务委员李铁映近日分别到冰心和臧克家的寓所，看望这两位文学界前辈。
    桂子飘香时节，恰逢冰心90寿辰。10月5日，李铁映携一盆桂花前来为老人祝福。他为这世纪的同龄人举杯，称颂冰心作为五四新文化运动中涌现的作家，70年从不间断自己的文学生涯。他和冰心叙着家常，从室内养花问到生活起居，还谈到了他们共同关心的教育和知识分子问题。
    今天庆祝85寿辰的臧克家，下午在自己的小院里迎候李铁映，他收到的贺礼是一盆金桔。虽然是第一次见面，李铁映亲切地握着诗人的手说，自己早就是他的读者。臧克家高兴地念起了他新写的诗，还谈到早年的革命经历，谈到与老一辈革命家的友谊。
    文化部代部长贺敬之陪同李铁映去看望了冰心和臧克家。
