Today is World Habitat Day. The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements has designated this year's theme as: "Housing, Health, and Family." Lin Hanxiong, Chairman of the Chinese World Habitat Day Organizing Committee and Minister of the Ministry of Construction, delivered a speech today titled "Effectively Addressing Housing Difficulties and Striving to Improve People's Living Conditions."

Housing is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention, and both the Party and various levels of government place great importance on it. From 1979 to 1988, a total of 1.24 billion square meters of new housing was constructed in urban areas across the country. The per capita living space in cities has increased from 3.6 square meters in 1978 to 6.3 square meters in 1988. The per capita housing area in rural areas has reached nearly 20 square meters. However, the housing problem for urban residents has not been adequately resolved. As of last year, there were still 5.75 million households in the cities facing housing difficulties.

Lin Hanxiong pointed out that by 1995, the focus of solving the housing problem should be on addressing the issue of whether housing is available. Policies should be tilted towards first solving the housing problems of severely disadvantaged households and those without housing, as well as accelerating the renovation of dilapidated houses and shantytowns. The initial plan is to proceed in three steps: by 1991, focus on solving the housing problems of households without housing and those with severely disadvantaged living conditions of less than 2 square meters per person; by 1995, basically solve the housing problems of households with living conditions of 3 to 4 square meters per person and those without housing; and by 2000, basically solve the housing problems of households with living conditions of 5 to 6 square meters per person.

    林汉雄发表谈话纪念世界住房日
    我国今后住房工作重点解决有无问题
    本报北京十月二日讯　今天是世界住房日。联合国人居中心确定今年的庆祝主题是：住房、健康和家庭。中国世界住房日组织委员会主任、建设部部长林汉雄今天发表题为“切实解决住房困难，努力改善人民居住条件”的讲话。
    住房是一个愈来愈受到人们关注的问题，党和各级政府都十分重视。一九七九年至一九八八年十年间，全国城镇共新建住宅十二点四亿平方米，城市人均居住面积已由一九七八年的三点六平方米提高到一九八八年的六点三平方米，农村人均住房面积已近二十平方米。但是，城市人民的住房问题解决得还不理想，到去年，城市尚有住房困难户五百七十五万户。
    林汉雄指出，一九九五年以前，解决住房问题工作重点要放在解决住房的有无问题上，制定倾斜政策，先解决住房特困户和无房户的住房问题，以及加快危房、棚户区的改造。初步设想分三步走：一九九一年以前重点解决无房户和人均居住面积两平方米以下特困户的住房问题；一九九五年以前基本解决三至四平方米以下的住房困难户和无房户的住房问题；到二○○○年基本解决五至六平方米以下的住房困难户的住房问题。
