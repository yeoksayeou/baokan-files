	Railway lines pass through cities, towns, villages, factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and military units. These entities must work closely with the railway authorities to strengthen the dissemination of railway safety knowledge among the people and to effectively maintain the normal order of railway operations. According to relevant regulations from the State Council, individuals or their affiliated units are responsible for any of the following behaviors that result in injuries or deaths. Those who cause damage to the railway as a result of such behaviors will be held accountable and severely punished:

	1. Walking, resting, or sitting on the railway embankment or rails.
	2. Loitering, strolling, crossing, or picking up coal and debris on the railway tracks within station areas and between stations.
	3. Climbing onto trains, riding on trains without a ticket, or jumping off trains.
	4. Grazing livestock or drying crops on either side of the railway embankment.
	5. Vehicles, tractors, and pedestrians rushing across railway crossings.

	Blind, deaf, preschool children, elderly, disabled, and mentally ill individuals who cross unmanned railway crossings without supervision and are involved in accidents will have their family members or guardians held responsible.
