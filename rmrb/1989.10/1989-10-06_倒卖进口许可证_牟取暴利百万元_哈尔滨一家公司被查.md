Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th.

The reporter learned today from relevant departments that the Harbin International Trade Company illegally resold import permits for tobacco filter material in August this year, illegally earning a "commission fee" of 10 million yuan. The Shenzhen Public Security Bureau recently uncovered this major case.

In August, the Harbin municipal commerce department, in violation of the State Council's regulations, issued a permit without the approval of the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. The permit, numbered 89-36-100069, allowed the import of 2,000 tons of tobacco filter material. The total value of this state-monopolized commodity was 9.6 million US dollars.

It was found that before obtaining the import permit, the Harbin International Trade Company had already signed contracts with the Shantou Special Economic Zone Yuefa Trade and Industry United Company, Shenzhen Nongxing United Company, and the Hainan Provincial Zhongdao Group Galaxy Enterprise Company to resell the import permit. The contracts stipulated that the three companies from Shantou, Shenzhen, and Hainan would respectively handle the import and sale of the goods, payment of funds, and procurement of the goods. In this way, the Harbin International Trade Company could earn 10 million yuan in "commission fees" just by selling the import permit. The Shenzhen Nongxing Company has already paid 7 million yuan to the Harbin International Trade Company in two installments via bank drafts in September. This illegal case, which occurred during the nationwide rectification and reorganization, was discovered by Shenzhen Public Security personnel during the transaction process.

The filter material used in cigarettes, acetylated fiber tow, is a state-monopolized commodity. The domestic demand for this material is very high, and some companies can earn more than 200,000 yuan per ton by importing it from abroad and selling it in the domestic market.

The case is currently under investigation.

    倒卖进口许可证　牟取暴利百万元
    哈尔滨一家公司被查
    新华社北京10月5日电（记者吴锦才）记者今天从有关部门获悉：哈尔滨国际贸易公司今年8月倒卖烟用滤嘴材料进口许可证，非法牟取“进口代理费”100万元。深圳市公安局最近已经查获这起大案。
    哈尔滨市经贸部门今年8月违反国务院有关规定，未经过国家烟草专卖局批准，非法给哈尔滨国际贸易公司发放了一份编号为89—36—100069的进口2000吨烟用丝束滤嘴材料的许可证，这批国家专卖物资总值高达960万美元。
    据查实，在得到进口许可证之前，哈尔滨国际贸易公司已经与汕头市经济特区粤发工贸联合公司、深圳农兴联合公司、海南省中岛集团银河企业公司签订了倒卖进口许可证的合同，规定汕头、深圳、海南这三家公司分别负责这批物资的进口及销售、支付资金、货源的事项。这样，哈尔滨国际贸易公司仅靠出卖进口许可证就可收取100万元人民币的“代理费”。深圳农兴公司已于9月两次以汇票付给哈尔滨国际贸易公司70万元。这起在全国进行治理整顿的时候新发生的违法案件，在交易过程中被深圳市公安人员查获。
    用于卷烟的滤嘴材料醋酸纤维丝束，是国家专卖物资。这种材料国内需求量很大，有些公司从国外进口后再卖到国内市场上每吨可获利2万元以上。
    此案目前正在审理中。
