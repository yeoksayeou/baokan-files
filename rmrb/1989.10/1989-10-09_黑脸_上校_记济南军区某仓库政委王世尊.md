Some people say that in these times, whoever plays the "black-faced" role will end up with a bloody head. However, Colonel Wang Shizun, the political commissar of a certain oil depot in the Jinan Military Region, has been the political commissar for 6 years, playing the "black-faced" role for 6 years, and has won the love and respect of the officers and soldiers.

When Wang Shizun first arrived at this depot, the social trend of gift-giving and banqueting had also blown into this small valley. Some officers and soldiers, for the sake of promotions, transfers, or joining the party, would give leaders cigarettes, alcohol, and even seafood like dried shrimp and prawns. Once, a soldier, in order to transfer his work, secretly gave Colonel Wang two high-grade cigarettes and good alcohol, leaving a note asking the colonel to help. The next day, these items appeared at the dining hall door with a "Lost and Found" notice: "These items belong to someone. Please come and claim them." Some people said Wang Shizun was too extreme. However, a few days later, the depot's party committee, based on the soldier's skills, arranged for his transfer. This incident made the officers and soldiers convinced, and no one dared to give gifts or ask for favors again.

Some people say Wang Shizun is stubborn, and even nine oxen couldn't pull him back. He said, "If you want me to do something that violates principles, not even ten oxen could pull me back." This oil depot is far from the city, and when the officers' gas cylinders run out, they have to go to the city to exchange them. Without connections, they often can't get them back quickly and sometimes have to pay a high price. Once, a leader from a Yantai gas company found Colonel Wang and said they could exchange gas cylinders at a discounted price of 9 yuan each for diesel. This affected the interests of all the officers, and everyone was concerned about the issue. However, Colonel Wang told the visitor, "The oil we manage belongs to the military, and we only have the responsibility to manage it, not the authority to dispose of it." With one sentence, he closed the "door of connections." Some officers couldn't understand, saying Wang Shizun was too inflexible in his actions. The entire depot has dozens of officers who use a few gas cylinders a year, and it's not something done frequently. He said, "Even one act that violates principles cannot be done!"

In March 1986, the depot decided to demolish 50 old flat-roofed houses to build dormitories for the soldiers. During the demolition, someone suggested using the old method of using a bulldozer to push the houses down, which would be fast and convenient. Colonel Wang disagreed, saying, "Using a bulldozer to push down the houses would destroy usable glass, bricks, doors, and windows, causing too much waste. If we dismantle them piece by piece, although it takes time and effort, we can save the country some money." Some people said his stubbornness was back, saying, "Building the dormitory costs a lot of money, and you don't have to pay a single cent. Why bother?" He said, "The country is still in difficulty, and saving even a little for the country is a lot." He personally led the soldiers to dismantle the houses piece by piece. After nearly half a month of effort, the 50 old houses were demolished. His hands were blistered, and he lost over 7 pounds, but he was very happy because he had saved the country over 50,000 yuan.

Over the past 6 years, he has insisted on going to the scene for loading and unloading operations. At over 40 years old, he carries bags and unloads barrels, competing with the young soldiers, but he has never taken a single cent of subsidy. After finishing the work, covered in oil and dirt, with greasy hands, he would use caustic soda to wash his hands instead of using the gasoline allocated by the higher authorities. The officers and soldiers all said, "We see the glorious tradition of the party, which has been forgotten by many, in Colonel Wang." In recent years, thanks to his playing the "black-faced" role and firmly stopping the wrong trends, otherwise, how could our depot have the song of righteousness?

    “黑脸”上校
    ——记济南军区某仓库政委王世尊
    有人说这年头，谁唱“黑脸”，谁要碰得头破血流。然而，济南军区某油料仓库政委王世尊当了6年政委，唱了6年“黑脸”，却赢得了官兵的爱戴。
    王世尊刚到这个仓库那阵子，社会上的请客、送礼风也吹进了这条小山沟。有的干部战士为评级、调动工作、入党，给领导送烟送酒，甚至送海米、大虾。一次一位战士为调动工作，偷偷地给王政委送了两条高级烟和好酒，留了张字条，让政委帮忙。谁知第二天这些东西出现在饭堂门口，还贴了一张“招领启事”：这是哪位同志的东西丢了，请领回。有的人说王世尊太“绝”了。可没过几天，仓库党委根据那位战士的特长给他调动了工作。这件事使干部战士心服口服，以后再没人敢送礼办私事了。
    有人说王世尊上来傻劲九头牛都拉不回头，他却说要让我做违犯原则的事，十头牛也甭想拉我回头。这个油料仓库离城镇较远，干部们的煤气罐用完后，都得去市里换。由于没有熟人，往往不能很快拉回，有时还要花大价钱。一次一位烟台煤气公司的领导找到王政委，说可以每罐煤气优惠9元的价格跟库里兑换柴油。这可牵扯着全体干部的利益，大家都关心着这个问题。然而王政委却对来人说：我们管理的油料姓军，只有管理的责任没有处理的权力。一句话就把这扇“关系门”堵死了。有的干部想不通，说王世尊办事欠灵活，全库30几名干部一年能用几罐气，又不是经常这样做。他却说：“违犯原则的事一次也不能做！”
    1986年3月，仓库决定拆除50间旧平房给战士盖宿舍楼。拆房时有人主张用过去的老办法——推土机推，既快又省事。王政委不赞同，他说：“推土机推房，一些能用的玻璃、砖瓦门窗就都毁坏了，浪费太大。如果一点一点拆，虽然费时费力，但能给国家节约一部分资金。”有人说他傻劲又上来了，盖楼花再多的钱不用你拿一分一毫，何苦呢？他说，国家还很困难，能给国家节约一点算一点。他亲自带领战士一点一点的拆卸，经过近半个月的努力，50间旧房拆掉了，他的手磨出了血，人瘦了7斤多，然而，他很高兴，因为给国家节约了5万多元资金。
    6年来，他坚持收发作业到现场。40多岁的人了，扛包、卸桶跟小伙子比赛，却没拿过一分钱的补贴费。每当干完活，一身油泥，一手油垢，他放着上级拨给的汽油不用反而用烧手的火碱洗手。干部战士都说：我们在王政委身上看到了被人淡忘了的党的光荣传统。这几年，多亏了他唱“黑脸”狠刹了不正之风，否则哪有我们仓库的正气歌？
