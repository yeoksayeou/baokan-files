Editor's Note:

Recently, people from various places have been writing letters or verbally reporting to the Party and the government about illegal activities by criminals, law-breaking and disciplinary violations by officials, and unhealthy trends in society. This indicates that the Party Central Committee's call to combat corruption and promote clean governance has been widely supported by the masses. The sense of ownership, democratic awareness, and legal consciousness among the people is growing. However, because whistleblowing inherently involves exposing, revealing, and accusing various illegal behaviors and hoping for legal action, it requires whistleblowers to have a fearless spirit. On the other hand, it inevitably causes fear and dissatisfaction among the accused and their associates, who may retaliate against the whistleblowers. Therefore, protecting whistleblowers is a problem that needs to be addressed by all levels of leadership and functional departments.

Strict confidentiality procedures must be enforced. Information about whistleblowers and the issues they report must not be disclosed under any circumstances when it is not necessary to do so. Due to unhealthy trends in society and lax discipline in some departments, in some places, the accused finds out as soon as the whistleblower exercises their right to report. In other places, whistleblower letters are often forwarded to the accused, which creates psychological pressure for the whistleblower. Enforcing confidentiality procedures involves protecting the legal rights of whistleblowers, the handling procedures for letters and visits, and the political and professional qualifications of the departments that handle the reports. This must not be overlooked.

Serious action must be taken against those who retaliate against whistleblowers. Some law-breaking and disciplinary violators, who believe they have power, use various means to persecute whistleblowers: they may withhold wages and bonuses, suspend jobs, transfer, or even dismiss them from work, or they may put them in "glass shoes," making life difficult for the whistleblowers. If this situation is not decisively reversed, evil tendencies will rise, and even law-breaking and disciplinary violators may escape legal punishment. Therefore, every instance of retaliation against whistleblowers must be dealt with. If whistleblowers, due to incomplete or inaccurate information, report content that is partially false or even false, the distinction between malicious accusation and framing and legitimate reporting and exposure must be made. It is not allowed for the accused to use this as an excuse to retaliate against the whistleblowers. Of course, whistleblowers must report facts truthfully and cannot spread rumors or exaggerate. They must not fabricate stories out of personal grudges. Those who frame others will also be held legally responsible.

### 保护好举报人

　　保护好举报人
    最近一个时期，各地群众就自己所见所闻，或奋笔疾书，或口头反映，纷纷向党和政府举报不法分子的犯罪活动、干部中的违法乱纪行为和社会中的歪风邪气。这从一个侧面说明，党中央关于反腐败、倡廉政的号召得到了广大群众的响应和支持；人民群众的主人翁精神、民主意识、法制观念正在增强。但由于举报本身具有强烈的排他性，即检举、揭发、控告、告发形形色色的不法行为，并希望得到法纪的查处。这样，一方面需要举报人具有大无畏的精神；一方面势必引起被举报人及其周围关系人的恐惧、不满，他们之中有可能对举报人实行打击报复。因此，如何保护好举报人则是各级领导机关、职能部门需要解决的一个问题。
    要严格保密制度，对举报人和所举报的问题，在不得公开的时候绝对不能泄露。由于社会上的不正之风和一些部门的纪律松懈，有的地方举报人刚刚行使了举报权之后，被举报人就知道了；有的地方动不动将举报信转到被举报人手里，这样就会给举报人形成一种心理压力。执行保密制度，涉及到保护举报人的合法权益，涉及到信访工作的转办程序，涉及到受理举报材料部门的政治和业务素质，万万不可忽视。
    严肃查处打击报复举报人的人和事。有那么一些自恃大权在握的违法乱纪者，采取各种手段整举报人：要么扣发工资、奖金，要么停职、调离甚至开除工作，要么给穿上“玻璃小鞋”，让举报人日子不好过。这种状况若不坚决扭转过来，邪气必然上升，甚至使违法乱纪者逃避法纪的制裁。所以，对打击报复举报人的行为，有多少件就要处理多少件。如果举报人由于对情况了解得不全面、不准确，出现举报的内容部分失实以至错告，也要分清诬告陷害与正当告发、检举失实的界限，决不允许被举报者以此为借口对举报人进行打击报复。当然，举报人举报时，也必须实事求是，不能捕风捉影或添油加醋，更不能为泄私愤，凭空捏造。诬陷他人者，同样要承担法纪责任。
