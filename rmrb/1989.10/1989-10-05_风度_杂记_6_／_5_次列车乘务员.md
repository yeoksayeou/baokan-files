		Demeanor
		— Miscellaneous Notes on the 6/5 Train Crew
		By People's Daily reporter Zheng Shengfeng

		(I)

		Catering staff member Xiao Li had just cleaned up the leftover bones on the floor, when a passenger turned around and threw the bones back onto the floor.

		Xiao Li gently advised the passenger, but the passenger retorted, "If the floor isn't dirty, why bother cleaning it? What are you here for?"

		Xiao Li did not get angry. He silently bent down and picked up the bones.

		The passenger's face finally showed a hint of remorse.

		(II)

		On September 5, on the train from Nanning to Beijing, crew member Song Xiannan of carriage 824 vomited for the third time.

		No one noticed. He quietly vomited in the toilet.

		This was his first time as a train crew member, his first long journey, and his first time working on a train to Beijing.

		Three active duty soldiers from the Faka Mountain garrison did not know about the many "firsts" of "824." They only knew that from last night to this morning, "824" had swept the floor four times and delivered hot water five times. Despite his poor appearance, he kept the luggage racks tidy. Whenever elderly or weak passengers got on or off the train, he carefully assisted them. The three soldier passengers wrote in the comment book: With a crew member like 824, the train will always be springtime!

		(III)

		Chief crew member Xiao Lu had only been in his position for a year when he was "removed from office." The reason was simple: he intentionally overcharged a passenger for smuggling cigarettes.

		Some people felt this was unfair: He overcharged for the public good. The passenger who was fined might be a speculator. Why punish him?

		The passenger transport section party committee's stance was clear: He overcharged and damaged the reputation of the people's railway! To maintain dignity, the organization planned to transfer him to another crew.

		"No! I will stand up where I fell!" A year later, he became the deputy crew leader!

		Thus, the organization's strict management became a famous tale, and Xiao Lu's correction of his mistake became a warning bell.

		For the 6/5 train, which has consecutively won the second place in the evaluation of the 2000-kilometer-plus express trains to Beijing for two years, the above is not news. However, ordinary deeds reveal spirit. Through these, one can feel the demeanor of contemporary train crew members, whose core essence is: everything for the passengers' peace of mind and satisfaction.

    ——杂记6／5次列车乘务员
    本报记者  郑盛丰
   （一）
    餐车员小李刚把地板上的残渣剩骨除去，一转身，那旅客又把吃剩的骨头扔在地板上。
    小李对他好言规劝，他却话中带刺：“地板不脏不扫，要你干什么？”
    小李不怒，默默弯下腰捡净骨头。
    那旅客脸上终于现出了歉意。
    （二）
    9月5日，自南宁开往北京的6次列车上，824号列车员宋献楠第3次呕吐了。
    没人看见。他是悄悄吐在厕所里。
    他是第一次当列车员，第一次远行，第一次工作着到北京。
    来自法卡山守备部队的3位现役军人，不知道“824”号的这许多第一次，他们只知道：从昨晚到今晨，
  “824”号已扫过4次地板，送过5回开水；尽管他气色不好，仍把行李架上的行包整理得井井有条；每逢老弱上下车，他又总是细心接送照料。3位军人乘客在意见本上写道：有824号这样的列车员，车上将永远是春天！
    （三）
    主任列车员小卢才“就职”一年，就被“罢官”了。原因并不复杂：他故意对偷带香烟的一名旅客多罚款几十元。
    有人鸣不平：他多罚款是为公家，被罚款的旅客有可能是投机商，凭什么处理他？
    客运段党委态度明确：因为他滥罚款损害了人民铁路的声誉！为了体面，组织想调他到另一个车组工作。
    “不！我在哪里跌倒，就在哪里爬起来！”一年后，他担任了车组的副车长！
    于是，组织治路必严，小张知错敢改，既成佳话流传，又作警钟鸣示。
    对于已连续2年获得铁道部2000公里以上进京特快列车评比第2名的6／5次列车来说，以上所述，不算新闻。不过，平凡之处见精神。透过这些，可以感受到当代列车员的风度，其核心的内涵就是：一切为了旅客的放心满意。
