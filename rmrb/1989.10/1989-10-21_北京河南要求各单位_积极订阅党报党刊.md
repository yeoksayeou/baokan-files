    The "Notice" requires that the propaganda departments and financial departments of various units assist the party committees and administrative leaders in overcoming difficulties and ensuring the subscription work for party newspapers and journals. Generally, subscriptions should reach the primary party branches and party cells. Some newspapers and journals can be subscribed to at the team level, party small groups, and guest rooms in hotels, restaurants, and inns. The required funds can be allocated according to regulations from administrative operational expenses, party funds, trade union funds, youth league funds, and enterprise costs (fees), etc.

    It is reported that all party branches of Beijing Construction Company No. 5 have subscribed to the "People's Daily" and have been commended by the municipal committee.
