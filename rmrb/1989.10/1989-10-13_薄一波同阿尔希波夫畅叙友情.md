Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 12th.

Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, had a pleasant meeting today with Ivan V. Arkhipov, a Soviet expert who had worked in China in the 1950s.

At 10 a.m., Arkhipov, accompanied by a delegation of senior members of the Soviet-China Friendship Association, arrived at the Great Hall of the People. They were warmly welcomed by Bo Yibo and Wu Xiuquan, President of the China-Soviet Friendship Association. Bo Yibo and Arkhipov embraced and shook hands for a long time. The two octogenarians then reminisced about the deep friendship they had forged in the past.

In the 1950s, Arkhipov served as the chief economic advisor to the Chinese State Council and led a team of Soviet experts to work in China for many years. At that time, Bo Yibo, who was in charge of the economic department, had developed a deep friendship with him. Among the Soviet visitors this time were veterans who had participated in the Northeast Liberation War, the chief designer of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and senior advisors who had worked in China's economic departments in the 1950s.

Bo Yibo recalled that in the early days of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union had helped China build 156 key projects. These key projects are still in operation today. China will never forget the help that the Soviet Union once provided.

Arkhipov shared his observations from their visit to Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. He said, "We have met many ordinary Chinese people. We found that the Chinese people have not forgotten the period of Sino-Soviet friendship. The Soviet people also have a deep affection for the Chinese people."

Bo Yibo said, "There was also an unpleasant period in the history between China and the Soviet Union. That unpleasant period has now passed. The relationship between the two parties and the two countries has returned to normal."

Arkhipov said, "The documents signed by Chairman Gorbachev during his visit to China this year fully express the determination of the two countries' peoples to improve relations."

The two elderly men expressed their sincere joy at the gradual restoration and development of Sino-Soviet relations in recent years and believed that the relationship between the two countries has a good prospect.

Bo Yibo and Arkhipov also sincerely exchanged views on socialist reform and the prospects for Sino-Soviet economic cooperation. Arkhipov enthusiastically praised China's achievements in economic reform.

    薄一波同阿尔希波夫畅叙友情
    新华社北京10月12日电　（记者周慈朴）中顾委副主任薄一波今天同50年代曾在中国帮助工作的苏联专家依·瓦·阿尔希波夫举行了愉快的会见。
    上午10时，苏中友协副主席、苏联前部长会议第一副主席阿尔希波夫带领苏中友协老战士代表团全体成员来到人民大会堂，受到薄一波和中苏友协会长伍修权的热情欢迎。薄一波同阿尔希波夫久久拥抱握手。两位八旬老人然后畅叙了他们昔日结下的友谊。
    50年代，阿尔希波夫曾担任中国国务院经济总顾问，率苏联专家组在中国工作多年。那时，在经济部门担任领导职务的薄一波就同他结下了深厚的友情。这次来访的苏联客人中有参加过东北解放战争的老战士、武汉长江大桥总设计师、50年代在中国经济部门担任高级顾问的专家等。
    薄一波回忆说，新中国建立初期，苏联曾帮助中国兴建了156项重点工程。这些重点工程至今仍在发挥作用。中国对苏联曾经给予的帮助是永远不会忘记的。
    阿尔希波夫谈起了他们这次访问北京、大连、上海和杭州的见闻。他说：“我们接触了许多中国普通老百姓。我们发现中国人民没有忘记中苏友好的那段历史。苏联人民对中国人民也怀有同样深厚的友好感情。”
    薄一波说：“中苏之间也有一段不愉快的历史。现在这一段不愉快的历史已经过去了。我们两党和两国的关系已经恢复了正常。”
    阿尔希波夫说：“今年戈尔巴乔夫主席访问中国时同中国方面所签署的文件，充分表达了苏中两国人民要改善关系的决心。”
    两位老人对近几年来中苏关系逐步得以恢复和发展表示由衷的高兴，并认为两国关系有着良好的前景。
    薄一波和阿尔希波夫还就社会主义改革和中苏经济合作前景诚挚地交换了看法。阿尔希波夫热情赞扬中国在经济改革方面所取得的成就。
