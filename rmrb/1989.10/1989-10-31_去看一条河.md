Title: To See a River

Three years ago, on that evening, we went to see a river.

The jeep bounced along the dusty dirt road, and I sat next to my father, feeling like we were heading to a long-awaited rendezvous.

“Have you been there before?”

“Thirty-two years ago.”

“What was it like?”

“The dam was under construction.”

When talking about an old friend he hadn't seen in a long time, my father's stern face showed a look of longing, appearing particularly gentle in the soft light of dusk. The car jolted along the uneven stone path. Thirty-two years ago, I hadn't been born yet, but now, with my father, I was heading to pay homage to a river, with the same youth as my father had thirty-two years ago. This time, I didn't feel carsick.

The first sensation upon standing on the dam was the fierce wind. Looking down, the surging river water formed torrents rushing through the gorge. Thirty-two years ago, on this construction site of the dam that blocked the Yellow River, the best young people of my age gathered here. Their ranks formed a river, surging to this remote corner of the west, standing on this very land under the fierce wind, just like I am now?

The wind fiercely whipped my forehead and cheeks. I knew this wind had also whipped the young faces of those builders. In the evenings of many years ago, these waves that were tossed up by the river had also left specks of muddy color on their healthy, tanned arms. My father stood firmly against the wind. Those sleepless nights, the tents they built on the construction site with their own hands, the golden, uplifting songs—they were in his books, and in this river too? Stroking the railing, my father's eyes sparkled with intoxicated longing. So, they walked with such big strides, chatting and laughing, supporting each other, living with vigor, knowing hardship but never sighing—those companions, you bathed in the same evening glow and wind as I am today? Although almost no one comes to visit now, to see this river, the road is hard to travel, far and rugged, with only a few figures on the bridge and the dam, thirty years ago, a magnificent project was being completed here. To build such a dam on a river that had been untamed for thousands of years was itself a miracle, wasn't it?

Walking from the dam to the concrete bridge below, choosing a good angle, taking a photo with my companions, and then specially choosing an angle to have my father and me photographed. Underfoot and beside us were the river's giant waves. Running from the camera to my father's side, the starry specks of muddy water splashed on us, glancing at my father's clean white cotton shirt, his back also had splashes of memory. We laughed so heartily.

As we were leaving, my father, who had been silent all along, pointed in the direction of the turbulent waters: “Back then, it was high and dangerous, we called it the ‘midstream pillar.’” Turning around, I saw a green stone pillar standing proudly in the rapids, like a bronze statue.

I understood why my father brought me to this now almost deserted, neglected corner of the west, to this place that some scientists have declared has little engineering value and that some biased young cultural figures have derided as a relic of the traditional era. In an evening that connects to the night, facing me was an immortal green stone “bronze statue.”

I remember after returning, the reluctance to wash the mud-spattered clothes in the water, the regret and remorse upon discovering the loss of the film, and of course, the series of complaints and grumbles I made to my father for losing this most precious record. My father smiled broadly and walked over to pat my shoulder: “Great river, look at your complexion, look at the midstream pillar, and we will gain boundless strength!”

　　去看一条河
　　何扬
    三年前那个黄昏，我们去看一条河。
    吉普车在尘灰翻扬的土路上颠簸，我坐在父亲身旁，像奔赴一个久待的约会。
    “你去过那儿吗？”
    “32年前。”
    “什么样子呢？”
    “大坝正施工。”
    谈起阔别的老朋友，父亲坚毅的脸上一副向往的神色，在日暮的柔光里显得尤其温和。车在凸凹不平的石子土路上摇晃，32年前还没出生的我，如今和父亲坐在一起，以与32年前父亲一样的青春，去拜谒一条河。这一次，我没有晕车。
    站在大坝上的最初感觉，是风太烈。俯视之间，腾跃的河水汇成一股股激流在峡谷中奔涌。就在32年前，这座横拦黄河的大坝工程工地上集结着最优秀的和我一样年纪的青年，他们的队伍汇成了一条河奔涌到这个偏僻的西部角落，就顶着这样烈的风，就站在我脚下站着的这方土地上么？
    风猛烈地扑打我的额鬓，我知道这风也曾扑打过那批建设者们年轻的面颊；在多年前的一个个黄昏，这些被急浪卷起来的水也曾在他们健康、黝黑的胳臂上留下点点泥土的颜色。父亲沉稳地迎风肃立。那些披衣而起的不眠之夜，那些工地上亲手搭建的帐篷，那些金子般的、昂扬的歌声，在他的书里，也在这河里么？抚着栏杆，父亲眼睛里闪烁着沉醉的神往。那么，他们就这么像我今天似的甩开大步走着，一路谈笑，互相搀扶，有劲地活着，知道艰苦却从不知道叹息的伙伴们呵，你们就沐浴在这今天我沐着的晚霞的风中么？尽管今天几乎没有人再来探访，来看看这条河，路不好走，迢遥，坎坷，桥上、坝上寥寥的只有同行的几个身影，可30多年前，这里正成就着一项惊天动地的宏伟工程。能在一条几千年来无人敢问津的凶悍的河上亲手建造这样一座大坝，本身不就是一种奇迹吗？
    从堤坝绕到下面的水泥桥上，选好角度，和同行的人一起留影，又特意选了角度，让同行的人摄下父亲和我。脚下、身旁都是那河的巨浪，从照相机旁跑到父亲身边，星星点点被急流掀卷起来的泥水溅在身上，侧眼看看父亲洁白的的确良衬衫，脊背上也有斑驳的纪念。我们笑得那么爽朗。
    临走时，一直不说话的父亲指着湍流的方向：“那时它又高又险，我们叫它‘中流砥柱’。”转过身，我看到的是一柄青色的石柱，在激流间屹立的雄姿，好像一柱铜像。
    明白了，为什么父亲带我来这个现在已人迹罕至的、被冷落了的西部角落，带我来这个已被某些科学家断言工程价值不大也被另一些偏颇的青年文化人贬损为传统时代落后产物的地方。在一个联结着黑夜的黄昏，和我面对的是一尊不朽的青石“铜像”。
    记得回来后，把溅满泥点的衣服按往水池中的那份不忍，还记得发觉底片遗失后的那种歉然和悔意，当然也记得面对我为失去这份最珍贵的纪录所发的一连串唠叨与牢骚。父亲宽厚地一笑，走过来拍拍我的肩膀：伟大的河呵，再看看你的肤色，看看中流砥柱，我们就会产生无穷的力量！
