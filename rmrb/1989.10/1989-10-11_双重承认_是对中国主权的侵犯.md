“Dual recognition” is an infraction of China's sovereignty. At the instigation and enticement of the Taiwan authorities, Liberia announced on October 2 the establishment of so-called “diplomatic relations” with China's Taiwan, resulting in a de facto “dual recognition.” This is a serious violation of the principles established in the 1977 Sino-Liberian Joint Communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations, thereby undermining the basis for bilateral relations. The Chinese government and people cannot but express deep regret over this.

It is common knowledge that there is only one China. The Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This is the unshakable position of the Chinese government and has long been recognized by the international community. In international relations, the Chinese government has consistently adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in developing friendly and cooperative relations with other countries. We oppose countries that have formal diplomatic relations with us from establishing official relations with Taiwan or engaging in official-level exchanges. We have no objection to Taiwan engaging in economic and trade exchanges of a civilian nature with countries that have diplomatic relations with us. Therefore, countries that have formal diplomatic relations with us should adhere to the principle of recognizing one China as agreed upon at the time of establishing diplomatic relations and should not engage in any form of “dual recognition.” Any situation leading to “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” is a serious infringement on China's sovereignty and is firmly opposed by the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

The Taiwan authorities have long claimed that “there is only one China,” but in recent years, in an attempt to break out of their international isolation, they have vigorously pursued what they call “flexible diplomacy.” The Taiwan authorities, under the guise of cultural, economic, trade, and technological exchanges, have used their “economic diplomacy” to buy influence and actively developed official relations with some countries. They have even gone so far as to abandon the “one China” principle and engage in so-called “dual recognition.” The Taiwan authorities' actions obviously disregard the strong desire of the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for peaceful reunification of the motherland. They seek to gain international recognition for Taiwan as an independent political entity, thereby creating a de facto “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan.” The Taiwan authorities' actions of abandoning national unity and undermining the reunification of the motherland are despised by all Chinese people at home and abroad. The Taiwan authorities should recognize the situation and understand that there is no “flexibility” in the “one China” and “reunification of the motherland” issue. Anyone who violates this principle is a traitor to the nation and will be punished by history.

China will be unified, and Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the trend of the times and the will of the people, and no force can stop it. If someone, for the sake of short-term economic interests, does something that harms China's national unity and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people, it is undoubtedly very shortsighted. We believe that the vast majority of countries that have established diplomatic relations with us do not support such shortsighted policies. They respect and understand China's principled position on the Taiwan issue and develop friendly relations with China. We hope that the Liberian government will value the friendship between the two peoples, change its attitude, and take measures that are in the long-term interests of the two peoples. We also warn the Taiwan authorities that their attempts to use economic strength to launch a “silver bullet” offensive and pursue “flexible diplomacy” to achieve the goal of creating “two Chinas” will not succeed and will inevitably face increasing opposition from the Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan. For the Taiwan authorities, a more realistic approach is to seek a reasonable and peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait under the premise of one China, rather than doing things that are not conducive to the reunification of the motherland.

    “双重承认”是对中国主权的侵犯
    本报评论员
    在台湾当局的策划和诱使下，利比里亚于10月2日宣布与中国的台湾建立所谓“外交关系”，造成事实上的“双重承认”。这是严重违背1977年中利两国建交公报所确定的原则，从而破坏了双方建立外交关系的基础。中国政府和人民不能不对此表示极大的遗憾。
    尽人皆知，中国只有一个。中华人民共和国政府是中国的唯一合法政府，而台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是中国政府坚定不移的立场，也早为国际社会所公认。在国际交往中，中国政府历来坚持在和平共处五项原则基础上发展与各国的友好合作关系，反对与我有正式外交关系的国家同台湾建立官方关系和进行具有官方性质的来往。对于台湾地区同与我建交国家进行民间性质的经济贸易往来，我们不持异议。因此，同我有正式外交关系的国家都应当遵循在建交时协议的承认一个中国的原则，决不能搞什么“双重承认”。凡是导致“两个中国”或“一中一台”的局面，都是对中国主权的严重侵犯，也是海峡两岸中国人民所坚决反对的。
    台湾当局曾经也口口声声主张“中国只有一个”，但是近年来，为摆脱在国际上的孤立处境，大力推行所谓“弹性外交”。台湾当局力图在文化、经济、贸易和科技交往等名义的掩护下，利用它的“银弹攻势”收买人心，积极发展同一些国家的官方关系，竭力在与我建交国设立具有官方性质的代表机构，甚至不惜背弃“一个中国”的原则，搞所谓“双重承认”。台湾当局这种作法，显然无视海峡两岸中国人民要求和平统一祖国的强烈愿望，企图谋求台湾在国际上被承认为独立的政治实体，从而制造事实上的“两个中国”或“一中一台”。台湾当局这种抛弃民族大义、破坏祖国统一的分裂行径，为所有海内外中国人所不齿。台湾当局应该认清形势，在“一个中国”和“祖国统一”问题上，没有什么“弹性”可言。谁违背这一点，就是民族的罪人，必将受到历史的惩罚。
    中国要统一，台湾迟早要回归祖国的怀抱，这是大势所趋，人心所向，是任何力量都阻挡不了的。如果有人看不到这一点，仅仅为了眼前的经济利益就做出有损中国民族统一的事，伤害中国人民的感情，无疑是非常短视的。我们相信，世界上已同我建交的绝大多数国家，都不赞成这种短视的政策，他们能尊重和理解中国在台湾问题上的严正立场，发展同中国的友好关系。我们希望利比里亚政府以中利两国人民的友谊为重，改变态度，采取符合我们两国人民长远利益的措施。我们也要正告台湾当局，那种企图挟经济实力，发动“银弹攻势”，推行“弹性外交”，以达到制造“两个中国”目的的做法，肯定不能得逞，也必然会招致包括台湾同胞在内的中国人民日益强烈的反对。对于台湾当局来说，比较现实的做法是，在一个中国的前提下，谋求海峡两岸合情合理的和平统一，而不做不利于祖国统一的事情。
