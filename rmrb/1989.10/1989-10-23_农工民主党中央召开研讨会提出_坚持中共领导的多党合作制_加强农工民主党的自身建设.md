The Central Committee of the China Democratic League held a symposium on its own construction from October 16 to 22 in Xi'an. The meeting summarized the basic experience of the China Democratic League's construction and required all members of the League to firmly adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party of China, enhance cohesion and centripetal force, and build the China Democratic League well.

Participants at the symposium believed that without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the China Democratic League would not be able to grasp the correct political direction and would not have the China Democratic League of today. Any attempt to promote a Western-style multi-party system is not in line with China's national conditions and is not in the interests of the China Democratic League. History has fully proven that the multi-party cooperation system led by the Communist Party of China has vigorous vitality and a great future.

The meeting proposed that the China Democratic League should learn from the past experiences where ideological and political work was somewhat relaxed, fully recognize the importance, urgency, and long-term nature of ideological and political work, and in future work, adhere to the principle of "two hands," to ensure that the China Democratic League always moves forward in the correct political direction.

The meeting required strengthening the construction of leading cadres at all levels, and making great efforts to solve the problem of the new and old replacement of leading cadres. It is necessary to build leading cadres at all levels into a strong collective that firmly supports the four cardinal principles, supports reform and opening up, adheres to close cooperation with the Communist Party of China, and has a certain mass base and social activity ability. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of both moral integrity and ability, and put political stance and ideological and moral qualities in the first place. Those with serious bourgeois liberalization thoughts, dissatisfaction with the Communist Party of China, sympathy for so-called dissidents, and those with personal political ambitions and poor ideological and moral qualities must not be introduced into the leading cadres of the China Democratic League.

Chairman Lu Jiaxi of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League submitted a written speech to the meeting. Vice Chairmen Fang Rongxin, Yao Jun, Zhang Shiming, Tian Guangtao, and others participated in the symposium.

　　农工民主党中央召开研讨会提出
　　坚持中共领导的多党合作制  加强农工民主党的自身建设
    新华社西安10月22日电  （记者刘尔宁）农工民主党中央10月16日至22日在西安召开自身建设研讨会。会议总结了农工民主党自身建设的基本经验，要求农工全党同志坚定不移在中国共产党领导下，增强凝聚力和向心力，把农工民主党建设好。
    参加研讨会的同志认为，没有中国共产党的领导，农工民主党就不可能把握正确的政治方向，就不可能有农工民主党的今天。任何搞西方式的多党制的企图，都是不符合中国的国情，也是不符合农工民主党的利益的。历史充分证明，中国共产党领导的多党合作制，具有蓬勃旺盛的生命力，是大有作为、大有发展前途的。
    会议提出，农工民主党要吸取过去思想政治工作有所放松的经验教训，充分认识思想政治工作的重要性、紧迫性和长期性，在今后工作中坚持两手抓，以保证农工民主党永远沿着正确的政治方向前进。
    会议要求大力加强各级领导班子的建设，花大力气解决好领导班子新旧交替的问题，要把各级领导班子建设成坚决拥护四项基本原则，拥护改革开放，坚持同中国共产党亲密合作，有一定群众基础和社会活动能力的坚强集体。要坚持德才兼备、把政治立场和思想道德品质放在第一位的原则，对那些资产阶级自由化思想严重、对中国共产党心怀不满、对所谓持不同政见者以及有个人政治野心、思想道德品质不好的人，一个也不能引进农工党的领导班子。
    农工民主党中央主席卢嘉锡向会议提交了书面发言。副主席方荣欣、姚峻、章师明、田光涛等，参加了研讨会。
