The Bu Lao section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal stretches from Da Wang Miao in the south to Lin Jia Ba in the north, covering a length of 72 kilometers. In the winter of 1983, the state invested 34 million yuan to dredge and renovate this section. After the canal was reopened to navigation in February 1984, relevant departments failed to strengthen management. Some enterprises and farmers continued to build illegal structures along both banks, destroying large sections of the embankment. Statistics show that in the 72-kilometer-long Bu Lao section, the embankment has been damaged in over 50 places. There are 79 loading and unloading sites without proper docks on the riverbanks, and 64 illegal piers and docks in the waterway. Among these, 49 are built by relevant units in Tongshan County, with some piers extending 17.5 meters into the navigation channel. In Li Lou Village, Ban Tang Township, Tongshan County, a new loading site was built, leveling a 500-meter-long section of the Bu Lao embankment. The ground level of the loading site is 1.4 meters below the floodwater level of the Bu Lao River.

The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal is a major waterway for transportation, irrigation, flood control, and drainage in northern and southern China. The damage to the Bu Lao section will inevitably affect the overall function of the Grand Canal.

    不牢河段违章建筑多  京杭运河作用难发挥
    京杭运河不牢河段南起大王庙，北止蔺家坝，全长七十二公里。一九八三年冬，国家投资三千四百多万元，对这一河段疏浚整治。一九八四年二月通航后，由于有关部门未加强管理，一些企业和农民不断在沿河两岸兴建违章建筑，大段河堤被毁坏。据统计，七十二公里长的不牢河，河堤被破坏五十多处。河滩上无码头装卸货场七十九处，河道内违章栈桥、码头六十四座，其中铜山县有关单位就占了四十九座，有的栈桥竟伸进航道内十七点五米。铜山县汴塘乡李楼村为了新建一个货场，将长达五百多米的不牢河堤夷为平地，货场的地面低于不牢河的洪水水位一点四米。
    京杭大运河是一条纵贯我国南北的水上交通、灌溉、防洪、排涝综合利用的大动脉。不牢河段遭到破坏，必将影响整个大运河作用的发挥。
