Under the warm autumn sun, Sha River is like an ancient mirror, reflecting the charming smile of a beautiful woman. The gardens on both banks are vibrant with flowers, like a beautiful skirt stretching out. The Li Garden is like a jade pendant, adding elegance to the mountain city of Sanming. The exhibitions on "Cultural Achievements" and "Historical Museum" during the autumn art festival make it even more captivating.

In my memory, Sanming's work on cultural relics protection is quite prominent. When I visited the Li Garden and saw the exhibitions, I followed the crowd into the main building, the Zhengshun Temple. There, I saw over 300 intricate carvings on the beams, depicting scenes like "Three Magpies Playing with Peonies" and "Five Rats Stealing Grapes," each one vivid and lifelike, exuding a rich Eastern flavor and a festive atmosphere. The temple was built during the Song Dynasty and has been repaired during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, blending the styles of several eras and holding significant historical and artistic value. What is unique is the 16 human-faced beast sculptures supporting the beams, symbolizing a spiritual attempt to transcend material forces. The temple also displays ancient human fossils excavated from the "Fox Hole" in Qingliu, pushing the documented history of the people of Min back by 10,000 years. The stone sculptures moved from Xianshuiyan, 100 miles away, are also very spirited. The oldest one is a statue of Sakyamuni from the Tang Dynasty, with drooping ears and squinting eyes, though "serene and majestic," there is still a subtle smile at the corners of his mouth. The statues of Guanyin, Manjusri, Samantabhadra, Maitreya, Weituo, and others all seem to be smiling, whether they are missing limbs, damaged, weathered by rain and snow, or covered in moss, they still smile. They came from history, from the wind and rain, and now face history with a smile.

In the 1940s, the cultural industry here was extremely backward. The young Chen Jingrun once studied here. He recalled the desolation of old Sanming, the women walking around with bare upper bodies, and the sound of bandits' guns, which made him feel sad and lonely. Did this world-renowned mathematician ever calculate the future of Sanming with his fingers? The former small town has now become a bustling new city. After several storms, the builders of the mountain city have a grand vision. On the east bank, there are libraries, workers' cultural palaces, youth activity centers, and modern buildings; on the west bank, the planned ancient cultural area consisting of ancient banyan trees, ancient city walls, Hongxian Temple, and Zhengshun Temple will soon be harmoniously integrated and reflected across the river.

I admire Sanming's industrial construction, with steel, textiles, and other products leading the province. I also praise Sanming's cultural achievements, which are even more impressive. This first autumn art festival is a grand review of 40 years of cultural development. I feel that the people of Sanming are very passionate and good at singing and dancing. This cultural pattern has developed from cultural people organizing "small culture" to various departments jointly organizing "big culture": the tourism system's "Green Journey" special show, through stage art, promotes local tourism resources and expresses the enthusiasm of tourism workers for "promoting the economy through tourism." The public security officers' "Blue Shield Light" special show praises the iron will and righteous spirit of the people's protectors. The resounding "School Voices" come from various schools in the city, with teachers and students singing together on stage, showcasing the results of educational reform. There is also the commercial system's "Fashion Show Contest," like autumn flowers in full bloom, integrating artistic beauty, life beauty, and advertising beauty. These clerks can not only meet customers' needs with high-quality service but also combine industry characteristics with performing arts to guide consumption...

I like the "Fragrant Grass" special show's "Tianzhu Girl." This performance has been selected for the Fujian Television Station's "Jinzhong's Jewels" National Day Gala. The three women on stage are mother and daughters. The mother is a primary school teacher from Daishan, who loves dancing in her spare time and has also influenced her two daughters. Although Teacher Qiu is nearly 40, she still dances gracefully, making people think of flying geese; the slightly taller elder daughter dances elegantly following her mother, swaying her hips and wrists like a bamboo in the wind; the innocent younger daughter, with a face like a full moon and a beaming smile, dances joyfully to the sound of bells and drums, like a playful little deer. This unique trio dance is very harmonious, soft and varied, earning applause from the audience. As a famous "civilized city," Sanming's performance is also unique: husband and wife singing together, sisters performing together, and "five-good families" helping the elderly and young people all take the stage, while the audience has many "civilized families" clapping. I also visited the "Elderly People in Sanming" poetry, calligraphy, and painting exhibition. Whether it is the poetry of a 90-year-old or the calligraphy of an 80-year-old, there is a rich connotation. The national painting of a paralyzed elderly person from Yuxian County depicts three tigers, either lying down or pouncing, full of vigor, especially the leaping one, making one feel the sound of pine wind and tiger roars, and a sharp spirit that makes one linger.

In the ancient-style Li Garden, the director of the Municipal Cultural Bureau, Zheng Shuyi, told me: The people of Sanming are developing urban culture according to the municipal party committee's deployment. Culture has become a focal point for the construction of two civilizations, and you can hear the footsteps of various industries.

The light waves lapping the shore, I felt a sense of history, but the people of Sanming have used their sweat to create a rich autumn color in a short time. How beautiful is their heart?

　　三明的金秋
　　林万春
    融融秋阳中，沙溪是一面古典的明镜，映着美人含笑的韵味，两岸园林姹紫嫣红，如一袭美丽的裙裾逶迤着，鲤园又似琳琅玉佩，给山城三明带来诸多的妩媚。而鲤园里“文化建设成就”、“历史博物”等金秋艺术节的展览，更是诱人的“点睛”之笔。
    印象中，三明的文物保护工作很突出。我游鲤园，看展览，随人们步入主体建筑正顺庙，但见枋梁上“三鹊戏牡丹”、“五鼠窃葡萄”等300多处透雕，形神毕肖，栩栩如生，在表达一种浓重的东方情调和充满喜庆的生活气息。此庙始建于宋，元、明、清历经修葺，综合了几个时代的风格，颇有历史和艺术价值。独具特色的是，16个宛如大力士顶住梁架的人头兽面，据说象征一种精神企图摆脱物质的力量。这里还陈列有从清流“狐狸洞”发掘的古人类化石，将有据可证的八闽人类史向前推进了一万年。从百里之遥的仙水岩迁来的石雕群像也很有灵气，最古远的一尊为唐代的释迦牟尼，垂耳眯目，虽说“妙相庄严”，但嘴角仍有一丝不易觉察的笑容，那些观音、文殊、普贤、弥勒、韦驮……都笑着，缺肢的、残身的、雨雪漫漶的、苍苔侵蚀的，还在笑，他们从历史中来，从风雨中来，又以微笑对待历史。
    40年代，这里的文化事业极其落后。少年陈景润曾在此地就学，他回忆过旧三元的荒凉，裸露上身招摇过市的妇女和匪盗的枪声，令他感到忧郁和孤独。这位闻名于世的大数学家，曾屈指算过三元的未来么？昔日的小村镇已成了熙熙新市，经过几度风雨，山城的建设者有着恢宏的气度。东岸的图书馆、工人文化宫、青少年活动中心和现代楼林；西岸规划以古榕、古城墙、荣先祠、正顺庙组成的古文化区，于不久的将来珠联璧合、隔河相映成趣。
    我慨叹三明工业建设步伐，钢铁、纺织等产品走在全省前头，我赞美三明文化建设的成就更是令人侧目。这次首届金秋艺术节，可谓40年文化发展的大检阅。我觉得三明人很有激情，能歌善舞，这种文化格局，已从文化人办“小文化”，发展到各部门联合办
  “大文化”：旅游系统的“绿之旅”专场，通过舞台艺术形象宣传了当地的旅游资源，又抒发了旅游工作者“旅游促进经济”的豪情。公安干警的
  “蓝盾之光”专场，讴歌了人民卫士的钢筋铁骨和浩然正气。嘹亮的“校园之声”来自市直各校，师生携手登台唱歌，体现了教育改革的成果。还有商业系统的“时装表演赛”，如秋花缤纷，把艺术美、生活美与广告美融为一体；这些营业员既能以优质的服务满足顾客的需求，又能把行业特点和表演艺术结合起来，引导消费……我喜欢“芳草”专场中的《天竺少女》，这个节目已选入福建电视台
  “闽中之秀”国庆晚会。母女三人同台，母亲是戴云山下的小学教师，业余爱好舞蹈，也感染了两位女儿。邱老师虽年近“不惑”，仍舞姿翩翩，使人想起远飞的鸿雁；稍高挑的大女儿，紧跟着母亲从容起舞，摇胯屈腕，似翠竹临风；天真的小女儿，面如满月，笑容可掬，随着欢快的铃鼓，如一头烂漫的小鹿。这出别致的三人舞协调极了，柔曼多变，博得满场掌彩。作为驰名的“文明城”三明的演出也别有风采：夫妻对歌、姐妹同台，“五好家庭”扶老携幼齐登场，而台下又有多少“文明之家”在鼓掌。我还采访了“老年人在三明”诗书画展，无论是九旬高龄人的诗，还是80高龄人的书法，都有一种丰富的意蕴。尤溪县偏瘫老人的国画，三虎或卧或扑，神采奕奕，尤其是跃起的，令人耳畔如闻松风、虎啸，更有一股宝刀不老的锐气，逗人流连……
    在古香古色的鲤园，市文化局长郑树钰对我说：三明人正按照市委的部署，进一步发展城市文化；文化已成为两个文明建设的聚光镜，听得到各行各业的跫然足音。
    轻涛拍岸，我领略到一种历史感，但三明人却在短暂的时间用汗水浇出丰厚的秋色，他们的胸怀是何等美丽？
