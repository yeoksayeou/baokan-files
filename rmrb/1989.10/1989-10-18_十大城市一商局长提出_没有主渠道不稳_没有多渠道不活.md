The directors of commerce from ten major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Xi'an, Harbin, Shenyang, and Wuhan, along with officials from the Ministry of Commerce, held a meeting in Tianjin that concluded yesterday. The meeting reached the conclusion that "without a main channel, stability is lacking; without multiple channels, the market is not vibrant."

This meeting primarily discussed the current situation of the industrial product market and the strategies for state-owned commerce. The directors attending the meeting believed that the market for industrial products has shifted from the abnormal situation of "boom, price hikes, and chaotic buying" last year to a more stable state this year. This is a gratifying result of the central government's series of rectification and adjustment measures. Facing this situation, the state-owned commerce sector must fully recognize the dialectical relationship of "without a main channel, stability is lacking; without multiple channels, the market is not vibrant." In the "three more, one less" circulation system, it is necessary to emphasize the role of state-owned commerce as the main channel while also coordinating with various economic components, giving full play to their respective roles, and jointly contributing to the stabilization and prosperity of the market.

During the meeting, the directors also predicted the market situation for the coming winter and spring, believing that the industrial product market will transition from a sluggish state to stability, but stability will come with difficulties. Under this situation, the main tasks for state-owned commerce are to ensure the supply of key commodities related to the national economy and people's livelihood on one hand, and to actively expand the purchase and sale of general industrial products on the other. To achieve this goal, it is essential to adhere to the socialist management direction and the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly, and to launch a sales campaign during the peak sales season of this winter and next spring.

    十大城市一商局长提出
    没有主渠道不稳  没有多渠道不活
    新华社天津十月十七日电（记者孟子君  曹健）“没有主渠道不稳，没有多渠道不活。”这是昨天在天津结束的全国十大城市一商局长座谈会得出的结论。
    这次由北京、上海、广州、南京、天津、重庆、西安、哈尔滨、沈阳、武汉的一商局长以及商业部负责同志参加的会议，主要讨论了当前工业品市场的形势和国营商业的对策。出席会议的局长们认为，工业品市场从去年的“旺、涨、乱抢”等不正常情况转为今年的平稳，是中央采取一系列治理整顿措施的可喜成果。面对这种形势，国营商业部门要充分认识“没有主渠道不稳，没有多渠道不活”，这样一个辩证关系，在“三多一少”的流通体制中，既要强调发挥好国营商业的主渠道作用，又要注意协调与各种经济成分的关系，发挥好各自的作用，共同为稳定繁荣市场作出贡献。
    座谈会上局长们还对今冬明春的市场形势作了预测，认为今冬明春的工业品市场将从疲软状态走向平稳，但稳中有难。在这种形势下，国营商业面临的主要任务，就是一手抓稳定市场，对关系国计民生的主要商品和重点商品要做到保证供应；一手抓搞活市场，对一般性工业品积极扩大购销。为实现这个要求，必须坚持社会主义的经营方向和全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，在今冬明春销售旺季掀起销售热潮。
