The mysterious forests of the Tianshan and Altai Mountains in Xinjiang have recently been surveyed and mapped by a surveying detachment stationed in the region.

The Tianshan Mountains, which stretch across central Xinjiang, and the Altai Mountains in the northwest contain vast tracts of virgin forest, accounting for 32% of the total forest area in the arid northwest. Due to the high mountains and treacherous paths, these forests are covered by snow for most of the year, and their true extent has long been unknown. Since 1986, the soldiers of the surveying detachment have braved numerous hardships, climbing over a thousand peaks above 2,000 meters, to complete the field survey and mapping of nearly 500 topographic maps of the forest areas. They have conducted detailed investigations into the area, tree species, and coverage of the forests.

    新疆森林测绘普查结束
    据新华社乌鲁木齐10月11日电　（通讯员董贵学、刘晓斌）神秘莫测的新疆天山和阿尔泰山原始森林近日由驻疆某测绘大队普查测量完毕。
    横亘新疆中部的天山和西北部的阿尔泰山深处蕴藏着大片的原始森林，覆盖面积占西北干旱地区森林总面积的32％。林区由于山高路险，一年中大部分时间被冰雪覆盖，其真实面目人们一直缺乏了解。从1986年起，某测绘大队官兵们风餐露宿，克服无数次艰难险阻，攀登上千座海拔2000米以上的崇山雪岭，完成了近500幅林区地形图的野外普查测绘任务，详尽地调查了森林的面积、树种和覆盖度等。
