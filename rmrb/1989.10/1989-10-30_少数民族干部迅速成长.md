Over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, the cadre team of ethnic minorities has developed rapidly, and the proportion has significantly increased. By 1988, the number of ethnic minority cadres had reached 1.84 million, an increase of 1.05 million from the 789,000 in 1978, averaging an annual increase of 87,500. The proportion of ethnic minority cadres in the national cadre team rose from 4.76% in 1978 to 6.06% in 1988, making significant progress towards aligning with the proportion of the ethnic minority population.

The quality of ethnic minority cadres has also greatly improved. The current cadre team is mainly composed of those who have grown since the founding of the People's Republic of China, with a significant portion being trained in regular schools. Not only have a number of ethnic minority youth graduated from higher and secondary schools and entered the cadre team, but the existing cadres have also improved to the level of higher and secondary education through various channels. According to the 1988 statistics from the Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Guangxi Autonomous Regions on the educational background of ethnic minority cadres in the party and government leadership teams, all regional party committees have at least a junior high school education, and all regional governments have at least a high school education. Among ethnic minority cadres, professional and technical cadres account for 62.7% of the total, a significant increase from 30% in 1981.

Since the 1983 organizational restructuring, ethnic minority regions have adjusted and appointed leadership teams according to the "four modernizations" policy for cadres, bringing a large number of young and outstanding ethnic minority cadres into various levels of leadership teams. By 1988, there were 45,000 ethnic minority cadres at the county level and above, forming a normal pattern of age structure dominated by middle-aged and young cadres and the cooperation and succession of old and new cadres. The professional composition has also developed from the previous single structure dominated by literature, history, and philosophy talents to the current structure where industry, science and technology, culture and health, and agriculture and forestry are all adequately represented.

Ethnic minority cadres have gradually become the mainstay in the leadership teams of various levels of people's congresses and governments in ethnic minority regions. According to the 1988 statistics from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Hui cadres account for more than 60% in the leadership teams of the regional people's congress, political consultative conference, party committee, and government. In counties and cities with Hui populations such as Tongxin, Jingyuan, Haiyuan, Xiji, Guyuan, Wuzhong, and Yinchuan, the county and city mayors are all Hui cadres. In 1987, in the five major leadership teams of the three autonomous prefectures of Ganzi, Aba, and Liangshan in Sichuan Province, ethnic minority cadres accounted for 76.3%.

Currently, the number of ethnic minority cadres is still insufficient, and their political and professional qualities need to be urgently improved, especially in regions where cultural and educational undertakings are backward. The phenomenon of a lack of young and middle-aged cadres is very common. Therefore, vigorously cultivating ethnic minority cadres remains an urgent task in ethnic work.

　　少数民族干部迅速成长
　　华菊仙
    改革开放10年来，少数民族干部队伍发展很快，比重也大大增加。到1988年，少数民族干部已达184万人，比1978年的78.9万人增加了105万人，平均每年增加8.75万人。少数民族干部在全国干部中的比重由1978年的4.76％提高到1988年的6.06％，朝着同少数民族人口比例大体相当的方向前进了一大步。
    少数民族干部素质也有很大提高。现有少数民族干部队伍基本上是建国以来成长起来的，其中相当一部分是正规学校培养出来的。不仅有一批从高等、中等院校毕业的少数民族青年进入干部队伍，原有的干部也通过各种渠道提高到大中专水平。据1988年新疆、内蒙古、宁夏、广西四个自治区对党政领导班子中民族干部文化程度的统计，区党委班子均具有初中以上文化程度，区政府班子均达到高中以上文化程度。在少数民族干部中，专业技术干部已占总数的62.7％。这比1981年的30％，有了很大提高。
    1983年机构改革以来，少数民族地区按干部“四化”方针调整配备领导班子，使得一大批年轻优秀的少数民族干部充实到各级领导班子中来。1988年少数民族县以上干部已达45000人，形成了以中青年干部为主体的梯次年龄结构和新老干部合作交替的正常格局。专业也由过去的文史哲人才为主的较单一的结构，发展为现在工交、科技、文卫和农林都作一定组合的结构。
    少数民族干部在民族地区各级人大、政府领导班子中逐渐成为主体。据宁夏回族自治区1988年统计，在区人大、政协、党委和政府的领导班子中，回族干部占60％以上。回族聚居的同心、泾源、海源、西吉、固原、吴忠、灵武等县、市的县长、市长都由回族干部担任。1987年四川省甘孜、阿坝、凉山三个自治州的五大班子中，少数民族干部占76.3％。
    目前，少数民族干部数量仍然不足，政治、业务素质也亟待提高，特别是那些文化教育事业处于后进的地区尤为突出，领导干部中“青黄不接”的现象极为普遍。大力培养少数民族干部，仍然是当前民族工作的一项迫切任务。
