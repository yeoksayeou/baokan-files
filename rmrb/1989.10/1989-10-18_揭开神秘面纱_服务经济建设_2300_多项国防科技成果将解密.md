A batch of defense science and technology achievements that have been locked in safes for many years will soon be released from the "secret" and "top secret" zones to the public, serving the national economy and social development.

This was revealed by Jin Jude, a relevant official from the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, at a press conference held today. He said that these 2,300-plus projects will be announced by the end of this month. The content of the projects mainly involves the fields of aviation, aerospace, and nuclear technology. Among them, nuclear technology projects related to the development of the atomic bomb have been kept secret for more than 20 to 30 years. After being declassified, these technological projects can be directly applied to the national economy through transfer.

It is understood that this is the second time China has declassified defense technology achievements. Last year, the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense declassified 210 scientific research achievements, 10% of which have been applied to civilian production.

    揭开神秘面纱　服务经济建设
    2300多项国防科技成果将解密
    新华社北京10月17日电（记者李希光）一批锁在保险柜多年的国防科技成果不久将从“机密”、“绝密”的禁区走向公开，为国民经济建设和社会发展服务。
    这是国防科工委有关负责人金朱德在今天举行的新闻发布会上透露的。他说，这批解密项目为2300多项，将于本月底公布。项目内容主要涉及航空、航天以及核技术等领域。其中与原子弹研制有关的核技术项目曾经被保密长达二三十年之久。解密之后，这批技术项目可以通过转让直接应用于国民经济建设。
    据了解，这是我国第二次对国防技术成果施行解密。去年，国防科工委曾解密210项科研成果，已有10％被应用到民用生产中。
