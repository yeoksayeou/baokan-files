Portugal has a unique type of tourist hotel known as an inn. These inns are characterized by their simple facilities and are typically used by guests for short stays. Built on the sites of ancient architectural ruins, these inns are small, distinctive, and imbued with a classical cultural atmosphere, making them highly popular among foreign tourists.

Constructing these tourist inns not only preserves the appearance of ancient buildings but also stimulates the development of local traditional foods, brewing, and handicraft industries, thereby promoting economic prosperity.

The author once visited the Palmelinha Castle Tourist Inn located south of Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. From a distance, it appears as an ancient castle on a hill. It is said that the first king of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, fought against the Moors there and eventually drove them out. This castle is a witness to Portugal's history and a source of national pride.

Upon entering the ancient castle, one discovers a 14th-century monastery inside. The inn is built within this monastery. Upon entering the hall, one sees a finely crafted tapestry hanging on the wall. The tapestry depicts a beautiful and ancient Portuguese folk tale, with colors and compositions that evoke a sense of antiquity and elegance.

The original two halls of the monastery have been converted into a bar and a television room. The courtyard of the monastery has been turned into an open-air tea lounge, where people can gather and dance during holidays. The basement of the monastery has been divided into a kitchen, storage room, and laundry room. The second and third floors have been converted into guest rooms. The wall lamps in the guest room corridors are designed to resemble white candles, with light bulbs shaped like candle flames. The dim lighting and solemn atmosphere make one feel as if they are in a medieval monastery.

The dining area for the nuns in the past has become the current guest dining room. The former living quarters of the nuns have been transformed into today's guest rooms. Although the rooms are not luxurious, they are equipped with carpets, sofas, mattresses, telephones, and sanitary facilities, providing a sense of tranquility and comfort. The stone windows where the nuns once prayed have become ideal observation points. From here, one can gaze upon the vast Atlantic Ocean and the scenic tourist destination of Traia Island, sparking endless imagination.

The inn manager who accompanied us on the tour is a middle-aged man with a deep interest in Chinese culture. Upon learning that we were from China, he became particularly excited. He told us that he reads a passage from the Chinese "I Ching" before starting work each day to decide how to proceed with the day's tasks.

He introduced that Portugal's tourist inns first appeared in the 1940s. After decades of development, they have now formed a nationwide tourist inn network from south to north, with 27 inns featuring different regional characteristics. These inns are state-owned enterprises built by the government and are under the jurisdiction of the National Tourism Company.

After the tour, we asked the manager if building tourist inns in ancient buildings would damage the scenery and if it was economically viable. He replied, "Converting ancient buildings into tourist inns does not alter the original architectural layout but rather cleverly utilizes the existing space. This achieves the goal of preserving ancient buildings while promoting the development of the tourism industry. It benefits both the country and the people, so why not do it?"

　　昔日宫殿古堡
    今天旅游客栈
　　蒋咸康
    葡萄牙有一种别致的旅游饭店，因设施比较简单而客人又往往只作短暂停留故取名客栈。这种客栈在古建筑遗址上建成，小巧玲珑、别具一格，富有古典文化气息的特点，因而深受外国游客欢迎。
    兴建这种旅游客栈既保护了古建筑的风貌，还带动了有传统特色的地方食品、酿酒和手工艺品制造业的发展，促进了经济的繁荣。
    笔者曾参观过位于葡萄牙首都里斯本以南的帕尔梅拉城堡旅游客栈（见图）。远远望去，那是一座山上的古堡。据说，葡萄牙的第一位国王阿丰索·恩里克斯曾在那里与摩尔人作战并最后赶走了摩尔人。这座古堡是葡萄牙历史的见证，是葡萄牙民族引为骄傲的地方。
    进入古城堡才发现，里面有一座14世纪修建的修道院。客栈就建在修道院内。步入门厅，便见墙上挂着一块做工精细的壁毯。画面的内容取材于葡萄牙的一个古老而美丽的民间传说。色彩和构图都给人以古朴典雅的感觉。
    修道院原来的两个厅改作酒吧间和电视室。修道院的天井作了露天茶座，在节假日，还可供人们联欢、跳舞。修道院的地下室被间隔成厨房、仓库和洗衣房。修道院的二、三层辟为客房。客房走廊两侧的壁灯架都做成白色蜡烛的形状，灯泡的造型是烛光的样子。幽暗的灯光，肃穆的气氛，使人们仿佛置身于中世纪的修道院之中。
    当年修女们进餐的地方成了现在的旅客餐厅。昔日修女们的起居室成了今天的客房。房间虽不豪华，但地毯、沙发、席梦思、电话、卫生设备应有尽有，使人感到恬静、舒适。过去修女们祈祷的石窗台，成了理想的瞭望台，从这里可以极目远眺。那烟波浩渺的大西洋，那风景宜人的旅游胜地特拉亚岛尽收眼底，引发起人们无限的遐想。
    陪同我们参观的客栈经理是一位对中国文化有着浓厚兴趣的中年人。当他得知我们来自中国时，显得格外兴奋。他告诉我们，每天开始工作之前，他都要读一段中国的《易经》，然后决定这一天该如何行事。
    他介绍说，葡萄牙的旅游客栈最早出现在40年代。经过几十年的发展，如今已形成了一个从南到北的全国旅游客栈网，有具备不同地区特点的旅游客栈27处。这些客栈都是由国家修建的国有企业，隶属国家旅游公司。
    结束参观后，我们问这位经理，在古建筑中修旅游客栈是否会破坏景观，从经济上看是否划得来？他说：“把古建筑改建为旅游客栈，并不改变原有的建筑格局，而是巧妙地利用原来的空间。既达到了保护古建筑的目的，又促进了旅游业的发展。这对国家，对人民都有好处，何乐而不为呢？”（附图片）
