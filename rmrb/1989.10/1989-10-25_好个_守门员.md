A Fine "Goalkeeper"

Zeng Mingquan, a tax collection assistant at Dongshan Tax Inspection Station in Shangyou County of our province, is an outstanding "goalkeeper" who safeguards the national interests.

**Bravery—Unfazed by Violence.** On a night in September 1986, two individual businessmen, who were partners in operating three trucks loaded with timber, were stopped by the Dongshan Tax Inspection Station and asked to pay the unpaid tax of over 900 yuan. The two businessmen not only refused to pay the tax but also rudely insulted and beat the two tax officials on duty. At this moment, Comrade Zeng Mingquan came to relieve the duty. On one hand, he patiently explained the tax law to the two businessmen, and on the other hand, he pointed out their mistakes of refusing to pay the tax and causing trouble. The two businessmen threatened, "If you dare to take our money, we will show you what we are made of!" Zeng Mingquan was fearless. Finally, the two businessmen admitted their mistakes and paid the tax in full.

**Breaking Through—Escaping is Impossible.** In the early spring of 1987, on a midnight, a truck from a food company, loaded with live pigs, tried to avoid tax inspection by driving in the dark. At this time, Zeng Mingquan suddenly appeared in front of them, waving a small red flag to signal the driver to stop for inspection. Seeing that the inspection station's barrier was not lowered, the owner ordered the driver to speed up and force their way through. The truck roared past Zeng. Zeng Mingquan quickly got on his motorcycle, braving the cold wind and rain, and chased after the truck. He pursued them all the way to the neighboring county before stopping the truck. After inspection, the owner had to pay the unpaid tax of 352 yuan.

**Bribery—Unsuccessful.** At around 2 a.m. on October 6 last year, a truck loaded with goods, driven by an individual businessman, passed the inspection station. After inspection, Zeng found that the truck had evaded taxes amounting to 11,833 yuan. He immediately asked the owner to pay the tax. Seeing that only Zeng was on duty, the owner tried to bribe him with 200 yuan. Zeng refused to take it. The owner then took out 1,000 yuan and offered it to him. Zeng Mingquan remained unmoved and criticized the owner's wrongdoing, insisting that he pay the tax according to the regulations.
