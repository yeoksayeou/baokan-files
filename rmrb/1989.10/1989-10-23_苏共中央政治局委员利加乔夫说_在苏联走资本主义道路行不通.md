Soviet Politburo Member Ligachov Says Capitalist Path Unworkable for the USSR

	New York Times News Service, Moscow, October 21 — Soviet Politburo member Yegor Ligachov believes that socialism has immense potential, and the key lies in actively utilizing it. He asserts that the current reforms in the Soviet Union can achieve significant success within the framework of the socialist management system, and that pursuing a capitalist path is unfeasible.

	Ligachov made these remarks in an interview with the weekly newspaper "Arguments and Facts," published on October 21, addressing a series of issues that have arisen during the reforms.

	In discussing how to overcome the current economic difficulties, Ligachov stated that capitalist management methods cannot achieve socialist modernization or solve serious economic problems. Undoubtedly, it is necessary and beneficial to learn from foreign experiences, but many effective and valuable experiences are not solely found in the West; socialist countries also have them.

　　苏共中央政治局委员利加乔夫说
　　在苏联走资本主义道路行不通
    新华社莫斯科10月21日电  苏共中央政治局委员利加乔夫认为，社会主义具有极大的潜力，关键在于要善于积极地利用它。当前苏联的改革完全可以在社会主义经营管理体制范围内取得重大成就，走资本主义道路是行不通的。
    利加乔夫是在21日出版的《论据与事实》周报上就改革中出现的一系列问题答该报记者问时说这番话的。
    他在谈到如何摆脱当前的经济困难时说，靠资本主义的经营管理方法实现不了社会主义现代化，也解决不了严重的经济问题。毫无疑问，可以并且需要从外国的经验中吸取有益的东西，但是许多有效的宝贵经验不仅仅在西方才有，社会主义国家中同样也有。
