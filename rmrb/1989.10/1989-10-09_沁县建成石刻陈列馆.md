A stone carving exhibition hall has recently been completed in Qin County, Shanxi Province, and is now open to both domestic and international visitors.

The exhibition hall, funded by the state, covers an area of 4,000 square meters and is divided into three courtyards: front, middle, and rear. Inside, it houses various stone carving art treasures from the Northern Wei to the Northern Song dynasties. The collection primarily features pagoda-shaped carvings, with niches carved around the pagodas. These niches depict Buddhist figures and various Buddhist rituals, showcasing vivid and lifelike craftsmanship. The hall also contains statue steles and inscription steles, most of which have historical dated inscriptions.

This collection of stone carving treasures provides valuable resources for studying ancient Chinese society, Buddhism, as well as art, sculpture, architecture, and calligraphy.
