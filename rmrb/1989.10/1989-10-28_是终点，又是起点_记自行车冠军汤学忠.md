The Finish Line, and the Starting Point
- A Record of Cycling Champion Tang Xuezhong

“Look! Number 1 is about to sprint.” As the spectators' words fell, Beijing's young athlete Tang Xuezhong took the lead, flying across the finish line of the Changcheng Xianjing Cup Road Cycling Race. The people watching the race in the ancient city of Xicheng, Beijing, were all delighted by the young athlete from Beijing winning the championship. Little Tang excitedly let go of the handlebars, tightly clenching his fists full of energy, and raised his arms in salute to thank the locals for their cheers and support.

As soon as Little Tang put down his bike and took off his helmet, he was surrounded by enthusiastic people. The reporter managed to push through the crowd and invited him to a quiet place for a conversation, only to be surrounded by spectators who followed.

At 20 years old, Little Tang wore a white sports shirt and black shorts, of medium height, with a clean and bright appearance. If it weren't for learning from the race broadcast that he was from Changping, Beijing, one would think he was a young man from the south!

Little Tang's parents had spent their lives farming, but he had always been fond of cycling since he was young. When he first started, he fell and got bruised, but this did not change his hobby. He took every opportunity to compete with his classmates, not stopping until he won. Perhaps it was the stubbornness of youth, or perhaps it was the dreams of youth, he hoped to become a champion one day, but in his dreams, he always fell just before the finish line, watching others snatch the championship. When he woke up, he would laugh to himself. He believed he would come in first.

At the age of 15, he was noticed by Coach Ma Shiqi of the county amateur sports school. From then on, he truly embarked on his career in cycling. Winter came and went, and in the blink of an eye, two years had passed. Under Coach Ma's careful guidance, he participated in city competitions and made his debut, being selected by the city cycling team. Soon, Tang Xuezhong became a young racer in the national training team. In the 4-kilometer race of the Sixth National Games, he broke the national record. Since then, Little Tang has won numerous championships in various national competitions.

In the final of the Changcheng Xianjing Cup Cycling Race held on October 22, strong competitors gathered, and Little Tang completed 90 kilometers in 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 45.40 seconds, winning the championship and once again demonstrating his strength.

“Is your training tough?”

“Very tough, we train over 100 kilometers every day.” His answer was straightforward.

“To achieve good results, one must train hard. The Asian Games are not far away.” He frankly and confidently told the reporter that he planned to be the first to reach the finish line of the cycling race at the Asian Games. However, this finish line might just be another new starting point in Tang Xuezhong's athletic career.

　　是终点，又是起点
    ——记自行车冠军汤学忠
    “看！1号就要冲刺了。”观众的话音刚落，北京小将汤学忠一马当先，飞也似地冲过长城鲜京杯公路自行车赛的终点线。在京西古城路观看比赛的人们都为北京小将夺得冠军而欣喜。小汤兴奋地放开车把，紧握着使不完力气的拳头，振臂致意，以谢父老乡亲们的呐喊助威。
    小汤刚放下赛车，打开头盔，就被热情的人们所包围。记者好不容易挤进人群，把他请到僻静处交谈，马上被跟随而来的观众围住。
    今年20岁的小汤，身穿白色运动衫和黑色短裤，中等个头，眉清目秀。要不是从赛场广播中得知他是北京昌平人氏，真以为是一位南方小伙呢！
    学忠的父母与庄稼打了一辈子交道，可他从小偏偏喜欢上骑车。初学时摔得鼻青眼肿，仍没有改变爱好。他利用一切机会与同学比试，不赢不罢休。也许是少年的倔犟，也许是少年的理想，他希望将来能当冠军，可梦中老是快到终点时，骑车摔倒，眼看着别人抢走了冠军。醒来时，他又暗暗笑了。他相信自己会拿第一的。
    15岁那年，他被县业余体校马士祺老师看中了。从此，他真正走上了车轮滚滚的运动生涯。冬去春来，一晃2年，他经过马老师的悉心指导，参加市里比赛初露头角，被市自行车队选走。不久，汤学忠又成了国家集训队的年轻车手。在第六届全运会4公里比赛中，他打破了全国纪录。此后，小汤在全国各种比赛中多次夺得冠军。
    10月22日举行的长城鲜京杯自行车决赛强手云集，小汤以2小时零7分45秒40的优异成绩骑完90公里，夺得冠军，再一次显示了自己的实力。
    “你们训练苦吗？”
    “太苦了，每天一练就100多公里。”他的回答十分干脆。
    “要想取得好成绩，必须苦练。亚运会离我们已经不远了。”他坦率而自信地告诉记者，他打算第一个冲向亚运会自行车赛的终点。不过，这终点也许只是汤学忠运动生涯中的又一个新起点。
