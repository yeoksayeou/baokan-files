At a time when some township enterprises are facing difficulties such as insufficient raw material supply and poor product sales, the township enterprises in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, have relied on science and technology to break new ground.

According to a survey, over 1,500 township enterprises in Ningbo City have joint ventures with state-owned large factories and research institutions in Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places. Many enterprises have undergone significant changes in just a few months, with their products evolving from simple and rough to high, precise, and advanced. Their flagship products are popular both domestically and internationally. In 1978, the total output value of Ningbo City's township enterprises was only 560 million yuan. By 1988, the industrial output value of township enterprises reached 12.34 billion yuan, accounting for 60% of the city's total industrial output value, which is 22 times that of 10 years ago.

The marriage of science and technology with township enterprises has not only led to the rapid development of Ningbo City's township enterprises but has also effectively adjusted the rural industrial structure, giving rise to a number of township enterprises with local characteristics. For example, Xiaojiang Town in Xiangshan County and Guling Town in Yin County have become famous for knitting, Yuyao Town in Yuyao City has become known for instruments, and Jiangkou Town in Fenghua City has become renowned for clothing.

Relevant departments in Ningbo City told reporters that township enterprises seeking professional large factories, universities, and research institutions as "backers" is beneficial for enterprises to leverage their strengths and avoid weaknesses, fully utilizing their respective advantages to improve product quality and economic benefits. This is a good way to promote enterprise development. In 1988, township enterprises in the entire city borrowed the strong technical strength from their "backers" to develop 685 new products. The output value of new products reached 630 million yuan, an increase of 21% over the previous year. They completed 428 key technological transformation projects with a total investment of 241 million yuan, adding 843 million yuan in output value and 88.82 million yuan in new profits. Many famous, special, and excellent products, as well as newly developed products, have entered the international market.

    宁波乡镇企业起飞  科技是个“助推器”
    据新华社宁波10月10日电（记者郭说传、朱国贤）正当一些乡镇企业面临材料来源不足，产品销路差的困难之际，浙江省宁波市的乡镇企业却紧紧依靠科技的力量，闯出了新天地。
    据调查，宁波市有1500多家乡镇企业与上海、北京、杭州等地的国营大厂和科研单位联营，许多企业几个月就大变样，产品从简单、粗糙向高、精、尖方向发展，它们的拳头产品走俏海内外。1978年，宁波市乡镇企业的总产值仅5.6亿，到1988年，乡镇工业产值达到123.4亿，占全市工业总产值的60％，是10年前的22倍。
    科技与乡镇企业的联姻，不仅使宁波市乡镇企业得到迅速发展，也有效地调整了农村产业结构，涌现了一批有地方特色的技术专业乡镇，如象山县爵溪镇、鄞县古林镇已成为针织之乡，余姚市的余姚镇已成为仪表之乡，奉化市的江口镇已成为服装之乡。
    宁波市有关部门向记者介绍，乡镇企业找专业大厂、大专院校和科研单位作“靠山”，有利于企业扬长避短，充分发挥各自的优势，提高产品质量和经济效益，是一条促进企业发展的好途径。1988年，全市乡镇企业借用来自“靠山”的雄厚技术力量，开发了685项新产品，新产品产值达6.3亿元，比上一年增长21％，完成重点技术改造项目428项，总投资2.41亿元，新增产值8.43亿元，新增利润8882万元。有许多名特优产品和新开发的产品，进入了国际市场。
