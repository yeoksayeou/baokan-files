Danzhou, an ancient county of Qiongya, has a history of over 800 years. At that time, this place was infested with malaria and devoid of human habitation. The aging Su Dongpo, after being demoted again and again, set out from Huizhou in Guangdong with his young son Su Guo. Stepping onto this barren and hot land, facing the wild southern wilderness, he could not help but sigh to the sky: "(Danzhou) 'Food and daily necessities are difficult to obtain'..."

In 1952, a platoon of armed soldiers from the First Engineering Brigade of the People's Liberation Army of China, along with several hundred liberated farmers and several dozen Malay returnees, carried hoes and luggage, traveled day and night, and walked over a hundred kilometers to this place. With a wooden-wheeled oxcart creaking along, they set up camp in this ancient wilderness that had been sleeping for a thousand years, drinking salted soy sauce soup, and sleeping on bamboo beds... The first blast of the mountain-opening cannon echoed through Luonan, and Xilian Farm was born... Through countless windy and rainy autumns, and countless days and nights, youthful sweat turned the barren mountains and wilderness green; in this land of malaria for a thousand years, one rubber plantation after another was established; even the old rubber trees that had been on the verge of decay for decades sprouted new branches... The former dangerous path of Qiongya has now become an endless treasure land...

People will forever remember February 9, 1960—on this day, our beloved Premier Zhou Enlai, after inspecting the naval base of Yulin, hurriedly came here. At that time, Xilian and the entire reclamation area were facing the most difficult economic period: sometimes there was nothing to eat, sometimes each person could only get one or two ounces to three ounces of rice per day, and had to go up the mountain to dig wild yams, pick wild fruits, and pluck wild vegetables to fill their stomachs; edema was rampant, and hunger threatened the lives of the reclamation workers; many comrades fell; the remaining comrades still gritted their teeth and fought in the deep mountains... At this difficult moment, Premier Zhou brought the care and greetings of the Party Central Committee. He warmly shook hands with the cadres and workers, saying, "You all, have worked hard!..."

The Premier came to the rubber plantation—this is the rubber plantation that the patriotic overseas Chinese of Danzhou successfully introduced from Southeast Asia in 1919, named "Tianren" and "Caihui" rubber plantations. It is the main seed source for the development of rubber in New China; it is the mother of the rubber industry in New China... Here, the Premier immediately recognized the female rubber worker he had shaken hands with three years ago at the National Women's Congress in Beijing. He happily called out, "Ye Yi!"... Ye Yi was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes. The Premier affectionately stroked the old trees that had endured wind and frost, were covered with scars, and had regained new life, and carefully examined the white latex dripping from the cutting lines and falling into the latex cups, saying solemnly: This is our own rubber, we must take good care of it, manage it well, and tap it well... Then, he shook hands with Zheng Hongfen, Ye Yi, Zhou Xiang and others who performed the rubber tapping for him, and took a commemorative photo...

Premier Zhou was about to leave the rubber plantation. The people of Xilian, filled with emotion, said, "Premier, would it be possible for you to write a few words for the reclamation workers?" The Premier thought for a moment and immediately said, "Good!" Thus, he left the precious inscription "Xilian Treasure Island, Pearl of the South."

The Premier left. The Premier never returned. But the rubber forest left the Premier's deep footprints... The Premier's repeated instructions have always resonated in the hearts of the reclamation workers, becoming a great spiritual force to inspire people to overcome difficulties and forge ahead!

The stars have moved, and the world has changed so much! Premier Zhou has passed away. The little girl who was once received by the Premier; the young man who once performed rubber tapping for the Premier, have all entered their twilight years. On the bumpy road of life, they have experienced so much, and many things have been forgotten and faded, but the happy scene of the Premier's reception is still fresh in their minds; the photo taken with the Premier is still cherished by their side; the Premier's repeated instructions are still engraved in their hearts...

Five years ago, I came alone to that rubber forest where the Premier had once stood. At that time, it was deep autumn. A red sun trembled on the branches of the rubber trees, the autumn wind rustled, and the falling leaves danced like butterflies, gently falling to the ground. The ground was covered with a layer of red, illuminated by the setting sun, like a blazing flame... I gazed from afar at the inscription stone in the forest, and my heart was filled with surging emotions...

Recently, for an interview, I came to this rubber forest again, also in autumn, the rubber forest was lush and green, showing no sign of autumn's desolation.

The sun had just risen, and the sunlight filtered through the layers of green leaves, illuminating the morning mist in the forest, forming blue, slanting light columns, and casting green light spots on the grass... A girl was tapping rubber, and she often passed through the light columns—she took over the rubber knife from her predecessors, using her hard work to keep this 70-year-old rubber plantation forever young, for which she has been an advanced worker almost every year, and has also won the honor of a national labor model.

What surprised me was that the once quiet rubber plantation had become very lively today—after Hainan Province was established, with the development and construction of Yangpu Port, a new, wide, and straight road was built through the vast rubber forest, passing by the Premier's inscription stone, connecting Yangpu and Nandao. From the morning mist and bird songs to the evening mist and moonlight on the tree tops at dusk, one car after another honked and sped past—the never-sleeping Yangpu Road, the never-sleeping rubber forest.

Walking here, the remembrance of the past fills me with aspirations for the future...

　　胶林，留下总理深深脚印
　　潘毅敏
    儋县，乃珠崖千秋古郡。800多年前，这里瘴疠遍地，荒无人烟。已入垂暮之年的苏东坡，被一贬再贬，从广东惠州起程，他与幼子苏过踏上了这块炎荒热土，面对野莽南荒，他不禁仰天长叹：（儋耳）“饮食百物艰难”……
    1952年，中国人民解放军林业工程第一师一个排的武装战士，和几百名翻身农民、几十名马来亚归侨，扛着锄头，背着行装，日夜兼程，步行百多公里来到这里，就着一部拉起来咿呀呀直响的木轮牛车，在这沉睡千年的旷古南荒扎寨安营，喝盐巴酱油汤，睡竹片床……第一声开山炮响彻洛南，西联农场诞生了……多少个风雨寒秋，多少个日日夜夜，青春热汗染绿了荒山野岭；在这千年瘴疠地，建起了一个又一个橡胶园；连数十年频临破败、枯萎凋零的老胶树也萌发了新枝……昔日这片琼州畏途已变成今日无边的宝地……
    人们永远缅怀1960年2月9日这一天——我们敬爱的周总理在视察了海军榆林军港后，又马不停蹄来到这里——当时西联与全垦区一样，正面临最困难的经济时期：有时断顿，有时每人每天只能分到一两二钱至三两米，要靠上山挖山薯、采野果、摘野菜充饥；水肿病不断流行，饥饿威胁着农垦工人的生命；有不少同志倒下了；剩下的同志仍咬紧牙关奋战在深山……在这艰难的时刻，周总理带来了党中央的关怀和问候。他满怀深情紧握着干部、工人们的手，说：“你们，辛苦了！……”
    总理来到橡胶园——这是儋县爱国华侨1919年从南洋经过千辛万苦引种成功的，叫“天任”、“蔡惠”胶园，它是新中国发展橡胶主要采种基地；它是新中国橡胶事业的母亲……在这里，总理一眼就认出了三年前在北京开全国妇女大会时曾握过手的女胶工，他高兴地叫着：“叶娣！”……叶娣激动得热泪盈眶。总理深情地抚摸着那一棵棵历经风霜，瘢痕累累，又获得新生的近六十高龄的老祖宗树，仔细察看从割线上汩汩涌出，又叮叮咚咚滴落胶杯的洁白胶乳，语重心长地说：这是我们自己的橡胶，要好好爱护，好好管理，割好胶……而后，他又与为之表演割胶的郑红芬、叶娣、周香等握手并合影留念……
    周总理就要离开胶园了。西联人激情满怀地道：“总理，请您为农垦工人写几句话不知行不行？”总理略为沉思，马上说：“好！”于是留下了“西联宝岛，南国珍珠”的珍贵题词。
    总理走了。总理再也没有回来。但胶林留下了总理深深的足迹……总理的谆谆教诲，一直在农垦人心中回响，成了激励人们不断战胜困难，勇往直前的巨大精神力量！
    星移斗转，世界发生了多大的变化！周总理逝世了。当年曾被总理接见过的小姑娘；曾为总理做割胶表演的小伙子，先后都进入了暮年。在崎岖人生路上，他们经历过的事太多太多，有许多都遗忘了淡漠了，唯有总理接见时的幸福情景仍历历在目；与总理的合影照片仍珍藏身旁；总理的谆谆教诲仍铭刻心间……
    五年前，我曾独自来到那片总理驻足过的胶林。那时，正值深秋。一轮红红的夕阳颤颤地挂在胶树的枝丫上，秋风瑟瑟，落叶飘零，打着旋彩蝶样轻轻坠下。地上平铺着一层，被斜阳夕照映得一片通红，像燎起的一片烈焰……我远远凝视着林中那块总理题词碑，心中漾起激荡的情感……
    最近，为采访，我又来到这片胶林，也是秋季，胶林郁郁葱葱，丝毫觉察不出秋的萧瑟。
    朝阳刚刚升起，缕缕阳光透过层层绿叶的缝隙，辉照着林中氤氲的晨雾，形成一条条蓝幽幽斜斜搭下的光柱，又在草地上投下一块块嫩绿的光斑……一个姑娘正在割胶，她不时穿过光柱——她接过了前辈手中的胶刀，用辛勤的汗水，使这个已70多年的老胶园青春永驻，为此，她几乎年年都是先进，还获得国家级劳模光荣称号。
    令我惊讶的是，昔日冷清的胶园今日变得热闹非常——海南建省后，随着洋浦港的开发建设，一条宽阔笔直的全新公路正穿过浩浩胶林，从总理题词碑擦肩而过，连接洋浦和那大。从岚雾弥漫鸟雀鸣唱的清晨，到薄暮迷朦月撒林梢的夜晚，一辆接一辆的汽车鸣着喇叭，飞驶而过——不夜的洋浦路，不夜的橡胶林。
    漫步在这里，对往事的怀念，使我充满对未来的憧憬……
