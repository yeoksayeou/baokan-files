The leader of the Chinese delegation to the 25th session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) today delivered a speech during the general policy debate. The leader, Teng Teng, elaborated on the Chinese government's stance regarding the current international situation and the role and policies of UNESCO. He emphasized that multilateral cooperation is essential for maintaining peace, promoting social progress, and reflecting the interdependence of the international community. It is also a crucial means for driving the common development of different nations. Teng also expressed that China will continue to maintain and develop friendly cooperative relations with UNESCO.

Teng first pointed out that the current era is one of striving for peace and development. Although factors of war still exist, the factors for peace are increasing, and the overall international situation is moving towards easing. In international relations, the trend towards multipolarity is continuing, and the more than 100 third-world countries, which make up three-quarters of the world's population, are playing an increasingly important role. On the other hand, the international community still faces numerous challenges. Regional conflicts have not ceased, the arms race continues, some international disputes have become more acute due to the violation of recognized international legal norms, and the relationship between the North and the South remains stagnant. The gap between industrialized countries and developing countries continues to widen, and heavy debt burdens, increasing population pressures, unemployment, poverty, hunger, illiteracy, and deteriorating living and ecological environments are all serious problems facing many third-world countries. These issues are major global problems that humanity currently faces. How to solve these problems should be an important starting point for UNESCO's consideration, formulation, and implementation of future activities, plans, and projects.

Teng expressed that China supports the draft of the medium-term plan for UNESCO for the next six years, which is being reviewed at this session. China will actively participate in various forms of cultural cooperation within the framework of the "World Decade for Cultural Development" and is willing to contribute to the success of the "Silk Road Comprehensive Research Program," one of the three major global projects of the "Decade."

Regarding the controversial issue of news and information dissemination in the medium-term plan, Teng said that the demand from many developing countries to establish a new world information and communication order is completely legitimate and necessary. Achieving a more balanced and two-way flow of information will help strengthen mutual understanding and friendship among countries and their peoples. The current state of world news and information exchange is far from satisfactory. Some reports that are biased, unfair, and even distorted against developing countries have naturally caused serious concern among many third-world countries. To correct the imbalance in the dissemination of information, UNESCO has done a lot of work in helping developing countries strengthen their communication infrastructure and train personnel. China supports UNESCO's continued prioritization of these activities in the medium-term plan.

Teng also pointed out that development is one of the two fundamental issues facing the world today, and UNESCO can make unique contributions in this area. He said that countries with different social systems, historical and cultural backgrounds, and levels of development can and should adopt development strategies that they deem most suitable based on their national conditions. The practice of imposing a specific economic development model and social values on others is neither in line with international norms nor with the trend of international development, and it is unacceptable to sovereign states.

Teng concluded by saying that China adheres to the basic policy of reform and opening up and an independent and peaceful foreign policy. China has always regarded strengthening solidarity and cooperation with third-world countries as a fundamental starting point for its foreign policy. China will continue to stand with the broad third-world countries, support their struggle against colonialism, racism, and hegemony, and develop friendly exchanges and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. China firmly opposes any country or international organization interfering in the internal affairs of other countries or infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries for any reason.

### 我代表团长在教科文组织大会上发言呼吁  加强多边合作维护和平共同发展

　　我代表团长在教科文组织大会上发言呼吁
　　加强多边合作维护和平共同发展
    本报巴黎10月20日电　出席联合国教科文组织第25届大会的中国代表团团长滕藤今天下午在大会总政策辩论中发言，阐述中国政府对当前国际形势和教科文组织的政策、作用的立场，指出多边合作是维护和平、增进社会进步的时代要求，也是体现国际社会相互依存，推动不同国家共同发展的重要手段，并表示中国将一如既往地同教科文组织保持和发展友好合作关系。
    滕藤首先指出，当前的时代是争取和平与发展的时代。战争的因素依然存在，但和平的因素在增长，世界总的形势在向缓和的方向变化。在国际关系中，多极化的倾向在继续发展，占世界人口3／4的100多个第三世界国家发挥着越来越重要的作用。另一方面，国际社会仍然面临着多方面的挑战，地区冲突并未停止，军备竞赛仍在继续，有些国际矛盾由于公认的国际法准则遭到破坏而变得尖锐起来，南北关系仍然处于停滞不前的状态，工业化国家与发展中国家之间贫富差距在继续扩大，沉重的债务负担，不断增长的人口压力、失业、贫困、饥饿、文盲以及生存和生态环境的不断恶化等种种问题，仍然严重地困扰着广大第三世界国家，成为当今人类面临的重大世界性问题。如何解决这些问题，应该成为教科文组织思考、编制和实施今后活动规划、计划和项目的重要出发点。
    滕藤表示，中国支持本届大会审议的教科文组织今后6年的中期规划草案，并将积极参与本组织在“世界文化发展10年”范围内开展的多种形式的文化合作，愿为“10年”三大世界项目之一“丝绸之路综合研究计划”的成功努力做出自己的贡献。
    在谈到中期规划草案中颇有争议的新闻传播问题时，滕藤说，广大发展中国家要求建立新的世界新闻和传播秩序，这一主张是完全正当的、必要的。实现更为均衡的、双向的信息交流，有助于加强各国及其人民之间的相互了解和友谊。当前世界新闻和信息交流的现状远远不能令人满意，一些对发展中国家不客观、欠公正、有的甚至是歪曲性的报道已经理所当然引起了广大第三世界国家的严重不安。为了纠正传播事业不平衡的状况，教科文组织在帮助发展中国家加强传播基础设施和培训人员等方面做了不少工作，中国支持教科文组织在中期规划中继续把这方面的活动列为优先项目。
    滕藤还指出，发展是当今世界面临的两大根本课题之一，教科文组织在对发展的研究方面可以做出独特的贡献。他说，社会制度、历史文化背景和发展水平各不相同的国家，可以也应该从本国的国情出发，采取各自认为最适合的发展战略。将某种特定的经济发展模式和社会价值观念强加于人的作法既不符合国际关系的准则，也不符合国际发展潮流，是主权国家所无法接受的。
    滕藤最后说，中国坚持改革开放的基本国策，坚持独立自主的和平外交政策。我们一向把加强同第三世界国家的团结合作作为自己对外政策的基本出发点。我们将一如既往地继续和广大第三世界国家站在一起，支持他们反对殖民主义、种族主义和霸权主义的斗争，同时在相互尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则基础上，发展同一切国家的友好交往与合作。我们坚决反对任何国家、任何国际组织以任何借口干涉别国的内政、侵犯别国的主权。
