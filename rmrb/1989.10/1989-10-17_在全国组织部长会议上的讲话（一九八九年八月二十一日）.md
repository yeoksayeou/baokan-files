Title: Speech at the National Conference of Organization Department Directors

Today, I would like to discuss several issues.

First, we must correctly assess the state of our Party organizations and Party members. Our Party has over 48 million members and nearly 3 million grassroots organizations, making it the largest communist party in the world. In the struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, our Party's organizations and members, in general, have proven to be reliable and have passed the test. The problems within the Party can be corrected by the Party itself, as has been proven. However, we must not underestimate the severity of the problems that exist within the Party. The fact that so many Party members participated in illegal demonstrations is a serious issue. I saw a report that mentioned a student Party member who wanted to join a demonstration. The school Party organization tried to stop him, but he said, "I am a student first, and then a Party member. I cannot not go." He placed the illegal student organization above the Party organization. Such a Party member is unqualified. Some Party members threatened to leave the Party when the Party was in danger. What use is such a Party member? I believe that such Party members should not be retained. Expelling a batch of them will not harm our Party. The motives of such people when they joined the Party are worth investigating; perhaps they were not properly vetted. Overall, our organization departments and the majority of Party members and cadres are diligent and genuinely want to do a good job for the Party. This is undeniable. However, when analyzing the situation within the Party, we must not underestimate the impact of international hostile forces attempting to peacefully evolve socialist countries. In the past, we were more aware of this issue. At the beginning of the reform and opening up, we were stricter in resisting bourgeois decadent ideas and more forceful in cracking down on criminal activities in the economic sphere. However, we gradually relaxed our vigilance on this issue. Second, we must not underestimate the harm caused by Zhao Ziyang's mistakes. Third, we must not underestimate the destructive impact of the rampant bourgeois liberalization on Party building.

Party organizational work must focus on the quality of Party members. When recruiting new members, we must prioritize quality over quantity and avoid having unqualified members. Unqualified Party members are more dangerous inside the Party than outside. If the quality of Party members is low, having a large number of members is meaningless. We must pay great attention to recruiting industrial workers into the Party. Recently, I visited a factory and noticed that there are very few Party members, especially on the production front lines. Some workshops and departments have no Party members. In recent years, we have not paid enough attention to recruiting workers at the grassroots level into the Party. The Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class, and industrial workers are the backbone of the working class. In large-scale industry and assembly lines, cooperation and discipline are highly valued, which cultivates excellent qualities in industrial workers.

The first issue I want to address is having a clear understanding of our Party. It is wrong to say that the Party is completely flawed. Overall, our Party remains a great, glorious, and correct Party. However, we must also fully recognize the problems that exist.

Second, we must seize the opportunity to thoroughly investigate and clean up the Party's ranks, ensuring the purity of the Party's organization. This work requires leadership attention, organizational implementation, clear policies, and steady steps. We must prevent superficiality and leave no room for future problems. For those who have made mistakes, we must help them change their thinking. We must correctly handle and strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions. We must unite and educate the majority, raising their political awareness. We must be more understanding of the majority of young students because they are young and politically naive. However, we must be strict with cadres, especially with leading cadres. In particular, we must thoroughly investigate the performance of leading cadres in key departments. If we do not do this, we will leave problems for the future, harming the entire Party. The most dangerous are those who sit on the fence. In the past, during underground work, those who were not clear in their stance were expelled by the organization because they posed a danger. Some people are still watching this struggle, waiting to see if there will be changes. We cannot allow high-level leading cadres to sit on the fence; this is opportunism. On matters of principle, we cannot downplay the issues. We must prevent those who sit on the fence from not undergoing serious ideological rectification and immediately turning red. Those who sit on the fence must not be reused; we cannot allow these opportunists to rise to power.

Third, we must fight against corruption and corrupt elements, and strengthen the Party's ties with the people. The spread of corruption seriously damages the Party's ties with the people and provides an excuse for domestic and foreign hostile forces to subvert us. The struggle against corruption is a matter of life and death for the Party. Our Party has always been rooted in the people, and our strength lies in our blood ties with the people. As long as we always represent the interests of the people and serve the people wholeheartedly, we can withstand any storm and remain undefeated forever.

The fight against corruption is not about making a big show. We must take steady steps. This time, we are focusing on seven issues, being practical and starting with the members of the Politburo, the Secretariat, and the State Council. Our country is so large, with 1.1 billion people and over 48 million Party members, making a uniform regulation that fits everyone is very difficult. The situation in each place is not the same, so we can only ask each place to take action according to its actual situation. Now, each place is actively taking action, and I believe that at a certain time, we should summarize the situation, such as how each place has implemented the regulations and actions, and whether we need to make some uniform regulations. In short, this is a matter of life and death for the Party. No matter who is involved, we must investigate to the end. For corruption that has become widespread, no matter how many people are involved, we must investigate to the end. All these illegal cases should be handled according to the law. Starting from the central level, we must do some practical things that the people care about, preventing formalism and more importantly, preventing one-off actions. Now, these seven points have been announced, and the general response is good. However, people also have a saying: "Wait and see," to see if this is just a one-off action. Therefore, we must see this through to the end. The General Office of the CPC Central Committee is responsible for liaising with relevant departments and must follow through to the end, continuously implementing the measures. We must carry forward the spirit of hard work and diligence, and strengthen the inspection and supervision of cadres at all levels. This is my third point.

Fourth, political system reform must be conducive to strengthening and improving Party leadership. The purpose of political system reform is to strengthen and improve Party leadership, not to weaken or dilute it. On this issue, we must reflect deeply and clarify the main manifestations of Party leadership. I think there are several aspects to this:

First, we must have a correct political line. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping, the line we have formed is correct. We must continue to adhere to the basic line of "one center, two basic points." I will not elaborate on this here.

Second, we must fully play the political core role of Party organizations at all levels. The Party is organized according to the principle of democratic centralism and is a unified whole. Denying the role of grassroots Party organizations will inevitably weaken Party leadership. Comrades in their speeches mentioned that emphasizing only political leadership is not enough; we should also have ideological and organizational leadership. I just asked Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Qiao Shi, and they both agreed with this view. The Party Constitution also stipulates this. If the Party does not manage ideology, what does it manage? If the Party does not manage cadres, what does it manage? The Party's combat effectiveness and strength are reflected in the 300,000 grassroots Party organizations. Otherwise, where does the central leadership come from? If all grassroots Party organizations are weakened, I believe the General Secretary will definitely become a "paper tiger." Therefore, on this principle issue, we cannot be vague. Now, it is necessary for the Party Central Committee to require enterprise Party organizations to play a political core role, which does not contradict the factory director responsibility system stipulated in the Enterprise Law. The factory director can fully play his role in management, production command, and technological development. In the past, we emphasized that the factory director can decide on the appointment of cadres. If the factory director is politically capable, when appointing cadres, he will definitely discuss it well with the Party secretary in the Party committee, not just decide on his own. If it is thought that the factory director responsibility system means that the factory director can appoint whoever he wants, this is a misunderstanding.

How do we deal with those who form factions, engage in nepotism, and appoint people based on personal relationships? Who supervises them? Therefore, the Party organization must still manage cadres. The Party is the political leadership core. Without organizational and ideological leadership, that core is empty! This must be clear in our minds. Without the combat effectiveness of the vast number of grassroots Party organizations, in the end, I believe the combat effectiveness of the entire Party will be empty. Where does the source of strength come from? It comes from the grassroots. Just now, Comrade Li Peng mentioned this, and I will emphasize it again: we must adhere to the principle of democratic centralism, which is to implement high centralization on the basis of high democracy, strictly implement individual submission to the organization, minority submission to the majority, lower levels submission to higher levels, and the entire Party submission to the central leadership. This is very important, and it is a summary of the Party's historical experience. Undoubtedly, the entire Party should follow the central leadership; otherwise, each will do as they please, and the Party's line, principles, and policies will be difficult to implement, and the Party's tasks will be difficult to complete.

This conference is studying organizational issues and plans to hold a Central Work Conference after a period of time, followed by the Fifth Plenary Session to discuss economic work issues. Economic issues must not be neglected. We have a strong Party, and if we can also develop the economy, strengthen the agricultural foundation, and revitalize large and medium-sized enterprises, no matter what anti-China forces or attacks there are, we can remain unmoved. With 1.1 billion people in China, what are we afraid of! Of course, this does not mean that we should raise our fists every day to fight others. On the economic issue, we must not neglect it at all, and the entire Party must unify its thinking. Comrade Li Peng and I both agree that we must seriously study which financial system is more conducive to promoting our economic development. There is a general principle: we must not allow the interests of existing industrial workers to decline. In any country, when handling the relationship between workers' income and production growth, the growth of wage levels must be less than the growth of labor productivity. If this principle is not followed, the economic source will inevitably dry up, and how can national construction be strengthened? A professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States came to Shanghai, and I met with him. He told me that in developed capitalist countries, wage growth must also be less than the growth of labor productivity, but slightly higher than the growth of prices. After liberation, we have always advocated that immediate interests should serve long-term interests, personal interests should serve national interests, and local interests should serve overall interests. The combination of these three interests is very important. From this point of view, we must emphasize that we will have to tighten our belts for a few years, not raising consumption desires too high. We must be like the ancient Chinese who tasted gall and slept on brushwood, working hard and diligently. For example, in the next three years, we will strive to rectify and improve the economy. I believe that as long as we rely wholeheartedly on the working class, the workers will share our hardships. As for individual business owners and private entrepreneurs, the state must protect their legal rights and interests, while strictly managing them according to the law and severely cracking down on illegal activities. A comrade mentioned the issue of millionaires joining the Party, and after the newspaper published it, many people discussed this matter. In the documents of this conference, it is mentioned that those with exploitative behavior cannot join the Party, and I agree with this view. Our Party is the vanguard of the working class. If we allow those who do not want to give up exploitation and live by exploitation to join the Party, what kind of Party will we build? In the primary stage of socialism, under the premise of adhering to the public ownership economy as the mainstay, we allow various economic components to coexist. However, individual economies can only be a supplement to the public ownership economy, filling in the gaps, and cannot be reversed, emphasizing individual economies and private economies to an inappropriate level. Large and medium-sized enterprises are still the backbone of the public ownership economy, and this must not change.

Third, according to the "four modernizations" policy and the principle of both virtue and ability, we must build good leading cadres at all levels. After this rectification and reorganization, we must assess our leading cadres. Comrade Xiaoping said that the Party must manage the Party, first managing Party members and second managing cadres. The principle of the Party managing cadres must be adhered to. In the reports, everyone mentioned that managing affairs and managing people must be consistent, but this does not contradict the Party managing cadres. The Party managing cadres should be more concentrated, and the Party's organization departments should manage this matter. For example, in Shanghai, the directors and deputy directors at the bureau level are all managed by the municipal Party committee's organization department. However, there has also been a phenomenon where, for example, a bureau's director is replaced, but the deputy mayor in charge does not know, which is not acceptable. Managing people and affairs should be combined, not having the deputy mayor specifically manage cadres, but he should be familiar with that cadre, and the organization department should seek his opinion. For cadre assessment using scoring methods, Shanghai has also learned from this, but this method may not be very practical. Ultimately, the method of assessing cadres should still inherit our Party's tradition, especially going deep into the masses, following the mass line, and listening to opinions from all sides. I believe that in this way, the mass line is also followed, the neighboring cadres are also understood, and the superiors are also understood. Understanding and grasping cadres from top to bottom will be more reliable than scoring. I am not completely against scoring; this method can be used as a reference. In the conference reports, a comrade's views on the revolutionization of cadres are very good. Many comrades have also raised this issue. Each province can formulate some requirements based on its own situation, and later the Central Organization Department can summarize them. I think political system reform must at least adhere to these three aspects to be conducive to strengthening and improving Party leadership.

Fifth, we must place ideological construction in an important and prominent position in Party building. Especially at present, we must use the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and Comrade Xiaoping's speeches to unify the Party's thinking. The struggle against bourgeois liberalization must be carried out for a long time and combined with strengthening Party spirit education. We must correct the confused ideological views caused by bourgeois liberalization, including the confusion in Party ideological and theoretical construction. Some comrades suggested that we should summarize and clarify some erroneous ideas and things that violate Marxism-Leninism from the previous period that diluted Party leadership. I think this view is good. Last time, we held an education conference, and universities are compiling textbooks. Our textbooks must clearly explain to students why China must be led by the Communist Party of China and why socialism must be implemented. These two questions must be explained from history to the present, clarifying the necessity. In recent years, during festivals such as May Day, May Fourth Youth Day, and December 9th, there have always been people who take advantage of the opportunity to create trouble. I believe that after this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, we must turn bad things into good things, and everyone must be vigilant in the future. I believe that first, we must, as Lu Xun said, have a backbone in political principles and stand up straight, opposing actions that harm the Party, the country, and the people. We must adhere to reform and opening up but must resist bourgeois decadent ideas. People from Hong Kong said that the yellow bookstalls in Shanghai and Beijing are even more rampant than in Hong Kong, which will harm future generations and seriously corrupt young people. "Cleaning up" is not just about closing down their stalls; first, we must uproot the source. Where do their yellow books and magazines come from? Without the proletariat occupying the ideological battlefield, the bourgeoisie will inevitably occupy it. This is absolutely true. Recently, many schools have started, and after the new semester of universities begins, the student enrollment rate is relatively high, reaching over 90%, with some unable to come due to traffic congestion or illness, all sending telegrams to request leave. After arriving at school, they generally attend a period of ideological education classes, just like other courses, and if they do not attend, it is considered absent. Therefore, the absence rate is low, and the attendance rate is high. These students' ideological state is generally good after arriving at school, which is inseparable from the overall situation, the education of the country, society, and family. Therefore, from now on, we must remember that we have such a responsibility on our shoulders, which is to educate the youth with proletarian ideology. These young people are our hope and future, and they will take over in the future. The new generation will surpass the old, and people will be replaced. Therefore, we must strengthen ideological education work and actively do it in the future, using proletarian ideology to occupy the battlefield.

Within the Party, we must carry out criticism and self-criticism and conduct ideological struggle. Ideological struggle has not been mentioned for many years, but in fact, ideological struggle is not about exaggerating issues; it is about sweeping away dust! Some unhealthy thoughts can be prevented from growing through criticism and self-criticism. If we are stricter with Party members in our daily work, often sweeping away dust, it will be very helpful in overcoming wrong thoughts and distinguishing right from wrong, unifying understanding, and strengthening Party unity.

In ideological construction, we must advocate learning some philosophy, especially strengthening the learning of Party member and cadre leaders. The Central Committee is preparing a learning plan, at least learning two aspects. One is philosophy. I believe that for a long time, we have neglected the study of Marxist philosophy, especially dialectical materialism. Idealism and metaphysical methods still have a certain market, often going from one extreme to another, with one-sided thoughts, and often failing to grasp the essence of things. This is related to the insufficient philosophical level of leaders. The other is political economy. We must emphasize combining the problems we encounter in our current actual life with the correct use of Marxist stand, view, and method to understand problems. In the future, in the field of social science theory, you can have this or that view, but there is one thing that cannot change and must be unified, which is to use Marxist stand, view, and method to observe problems. The guiding ideology and methodology of Communist Party members must be Marxist. This cannot change.

I have discussed these five points. If there are any mistakes, please correct them.

    在全国组织部长会议上的讲话
    （一九八九年八月二十一日）
    江泽民
    今天我想讲几个问题。
    一、要正确估计党组织和党员队伍的状况。我们的党是一个有4800多万名党员、近300万个基层组织的大党，是全世界共产党中最大的一个党。在制止动乱和平息北京地区反革命暴乱这场政治斗争中，我们党的队伍、党的组织总的来讲是好的，是经受住了考验的。党内产生的问题，我们党自己是能够纠正的，事实已经证明了这一点。但是，我们决不能因此而不去认识党内存在的问题的严重性。有那么多党员上街游行，就是一个严重的问题。我看到一份简报中讲，一个学生党员要上街游行，学校党组织不让他去，他说，我先是学生，然后才是党员，不能不去。他把学生非法组织放在党组织之上。这样的党员是不合格的。有的党员，在党处于危难时刻以退党来威胁党，这样的党员要他干什么？我看，这样的党员不必挽留。退掉一批，对我们党不会有什么影响。这种人入党时的动机值得研究，恐怕也没有经过什么考验。从总体上看，我们的组织部门和广大党员干部是兢兢业业、一心想把党的工作搞好的，这一点毫无疑问。但分析党内状况时，一是不可低估国际敌对势力企图使社会主义国家和平演变对我们党造成的影响。过去我们对这个问题比较清醒。改革开放之初，我们对抵制资产阶级腐朽思想抓得比较紧，对经济领域里的犯罪行为打击是比较有力的。但是后来对这个问题逐渐放松了。二是不可低估赵紫阳同志的错误所造成的危害。三是不可低估资产阶级自由化泛滥对党的建设的破坏。
    党的组织工作，要重视党员的素质。发展党员要重视质量，千万不能单纯追求数量，不能搞滥竽充数。滥竽充数的党员放在党内比在党外更危险。如果党员队伍质量很低，数量再大也没有用。我们要非常重视发展产业工人入党。最近，我到工厂去，看到产业工人中，尤其是生产第一线党员很少。有的工段、车间没有党员。这些年，我们对在基层的工人中发展党员注意不够。共产党是工人阶级先锋队，产业工人是工人阶级队伍的骨干力量。大工业，流水线，在协作劳动中，你中有我，我中有你，使产业工人养成了高度的组织纪律性和其他优秀品质。
    我讲的第一个问题，就是对我们党要有个清醒的估计。把党说得一无是处是不对的，我们的党从整体上看仍是伟大、光荣、正确的党，当然对存在的问题也要有充分的估计。
    二、抓住有利时机，认真抓好清查、清理工作，保证党的队伍的纯洁性。这项工作要领导重视，组织落实，政策明确，步骤稳妥。要防止走过场，不留后患。对犯错误的人，我们要促使他们思想转变。要正确处理、严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。要团结教育大多数，提高他们的思想觉悟。对大多数青年学生要多谅解一些，因为他们毕竟年轻，政治上幼稚。但对干部要严。在干部中，对领导干部要更严。特别是对要害部门的领导干部的表现情况一定要弄清楚，不弄清楚，留下后患，会贻害全党。最危险的是那些骑墙派。过去做地下工作的时候，有的人态度不鲜明，就要被组织丢掉，因为不丢掉他们，就会给组织带来危险。对这次斗争，直到现在还有人在看。看什么呢？就是看是不是要变。我们不能允许高级领导干部做骑墙派，提到原则高度这就是机会主义者。在原则问题上不能大事化小，小事化了。要防止骑墙派的人不作认真的思想清理，马上就转，而且染上非常红的颜色。清查出骑墙派的人绝不能重用，不能让这种投机分子、机会主义者上来。
    三、要同腐败现象、腐败分子进行斗争，密切党和群众的联系。腐败现象的蔓延，严重破坏了党和群众的联系，而且成为国内外敌对势力颠覆我们的借口。反腐败斗争是关系到党的生死存亡的问题。我们党是很重视这个问题的，也是有能力克服腐败现象的。共产党从来就是生根在群众之中，与群众的血肉联系正是我们党的力量所在。只要我们始终代表人民群众的利益，全心全意服务于人民，就能经得起任何风浪的考验，永远立于不败之地。
    反腐败，不是搞大呼隆，我们的步子要走得稳妥一点。我们这次抓七件事，实事求是，从中央政治局委员、中央书记处成员和国务院常务会议组成人员做起。我们国家这么大，11亿人口，4800多万党员，作一个统一的规定拿着往上套，是很难的。各地的情况不完全一样，我们只能要求各地结合实际情况进行治理。现在，各个地方都在积极地行动，我看到一定的时候要总结一下，比如各个地方规定得怎么样，行动得怎么样，是不是需要作些统一的规定。总之，这是关系到党的生死存亡的大问题，不管查到谁，都要一查到底。对已经成风了的腐败现象，不管涉及到多少人，都要一查到底。所有这些违法案件，应该以法律为准绳，该怎么办就怎么办。从中央开始，都要扎扎实实办一些群众关心的事，防止形式主义，更要防止一阵风。现在，我们这七条出去，总的反映是好的，但是大家也有一句话，要拭目以待，看究竟是不是一阵风。所以，这个问题我们要抓到底。中央办公厅负责与有关部门联系，要一直联系到底，要不断地落实。要发扬艰苦奋斗、埋头苦干的精神，要加强对各级干部的检查和监督。这是我讲的第三点。
    四、政治体制改革，要有利于加强和改善党的领导。政治体制改革的目的，是为了加强和改善党的领导，决不是削弱和淡化党的领导。在这个问题上，值得我们很好地反思，就是必须弄清楚党的领导的主要体现。我想有这么几个方面：
    首先，要有一条正确的政治路线。党的十一届三中全会以来，在小平同志的思想指导下形成的路线是正确的。我们必须继续坚持“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线。这里不多讲了。
    第二，就是充分发挥各级党组织的政治核心作用。党是按照民主集中制的原则组织起来的统一的整体，否认基层党组织的作用，必然会削弱党的领导。同志们在发言中说，党的领导作用只提政治领导不够，还应该有思想领导和组织领导。我刚才问李鹏同志和乔石同志，他们都赞成这个意见，党章也是这样规定的。党不管思想，管什么？党不管干部，管什么？党的战斗力，党的力量，表现在哪里？我看首先表现在近300万个基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用。不然，中央的领导作用从哪里来？如果党的基层组织统统都淡化了，我看总书记就一定会变成“空头司令”。因此，在这个原则问题上不能含糊。现在我们党中央有必要要求企业党组织起政治核心作用，这与《企业法》规定的厂长负责制并不矛盾。厂长在经营管理、生产指挥、技术开发等方面可以充分发挥作用。过去强调厂长可以决定任命干部，如果这个厂长是一个有政治水平的厂长，在任命干部的时候，他必然要和党委书记一起在党委里面很好地议论，不是他一个人说了算。如果认为厂长负责制意味着厂长愿意任命谁就任命谁，恐怕是认识上的偏差。
    有的人拉帮结派怎么办？结党营私怎么办？任人唯亲怎么办？谁来监督？所以，党组织还是要管干部。党是政治领导核心，离开了组织领导、思想领导，那个核心就是空的！这一点在思想上要明确。没有广大基层党组织战斗力的发挥，最后，我看我们全党的战斗力就是空的。力量的源泉来自哪里？来自基层。刚才李鹏同志讲了，我再强调一下，坚持民主集中制原则，就是要在高度民主的基础上实行高度集中，严格实行个人服从组织，少数服从多数，下级服从上级，全党服从中央。这个问题很重要，这是从党的历史经验总结出来的。毫无疑问，我们全党应该服从中央，否则，各行其是，党的路线、方针、政策就无法贯彻执行，党的任务就难以完成。
    这次会议研究的是组织问题，准备过一段时期开一次中央工作会议，然后开五中全会，讨论经济工作问题。经济问题决不可忽视。我们有一个强有力的党，再加上把经济搞上去，把农业基础搞好，把大中型企业搞活，无论什么反华势力，进行什么攻击，我们都可以根本不予理睬，做到“我自岿然不动”。11亿人民的中国，怕你什么！这当然不是说要伸着拳头一天到晚去打人家。对经济问题，丝毫不可忽视，全党要统一思想。我和李鹏同志一致认为，用一个什么样的财政体制更有利于促进我们经济的发展，要认真研究。有一个总的原则，绝不能使现有的产业工人的利益下降。任何一个国家，在处理工人收入与生产增长的关系方面，都要考虑工资水平的增长一定要小于劳动生产率的增长。若没有这个原则，经济来源非枯竭不可，国家建设怎么能够上去？美国麻省理工学院的一位教授来上海，我曾会见了他，他给我讲，在发达的资本主义国家，工资的增长也必须小于劳动生产率的增长，但比物价的增长要稍微高一点。解放后，我们一直宣传眼前利益要服从长远利益，个人利益要服从国家利益，局部利益要服从整体利益。这三个利益的结合是很重要的。从这点出发，我们要强调过几年紧日子，不能把消费的欲望吊得高高的。我们要卧薪尝胆，埋头苦干，比如说，再过三年吧，努力把经济整顿好、治理好。我相信只要我们全心全意依靠工人阶级，工人是会同我们共患难的。至于个体户和私营企业主，国家要保护他们的合法权益，同时，要依法严格管理，狠狠打击一些人的不法行为。有位同志讲了百万富翁入党的问题，报纸登出以后，许多人在议论这件事。这次会议的文件里面讲，有剥削行为的不能入党，我赞成这个意见。我们党是工人阶级先锋队，如果让不愿放弃剥削、依靠剥削生活的人入党，究竟要建成一个什么党？在社会主义初级阶段，在坚持公有制经济为主体的前提下，允许各种经济成分共存，但是，个体经济只能是公有制经济的补充，是拾遗补缺，不能本末倒置，不能把个体经济、私营经济强调到不适当的地位。大中型企业还是全民所有制经济的骨干，这条绝不能变。
    第三，按照干部队伍“四化”方针和德才兼备的原则，建设好各级领导班子。经过这次清理整顿，要考核好我们的领导干部。小平同志讲，党要管党，一要管党员，二要管干部。党管干部的原则是应该坚持的。简报中，大家都提到管事与管人要一致，但这与党管干部并不矛盾。党管干部还是应该集中一点，党的组织部门要管这件事。比如上海，局长、副局长这一级的干部，都由市委组织部来管。但曾经也有这样一个现象，如某一个局的局长，换人了，分管的副市长还不知道，这不行。管人管事要结合不是要副市长来具体管干部，但他对那个干部比较了解，组织部门应该征求他的意见。对干部考核用打分数的办法，上海也学习了，但这种方法未必都很实用。归根到底，考察干部的办法，还要继承我们党的传统，特别是深入到群众中去，走群众路线，听取各方面的反映。我认为，这样群众路线也走了，向左邻右舍的干部也了解了，向他的上级也了解了，上、中、下都了解了，对干部的了解把握性就比较大，比打分数准得多。我不是完全否定打分数，打分这个办法可以作为参考。会议简报上有位同志关于干部革命化那几条提得很好。还有许多同志也提出了这一问题。各省可以根据各省情况自己定出一些要求，将来中央组织部综合一下。我想政治体制改革至少要坚持这三个方面，才是有利于加强和改善党的领导的。
    五、要把思想建设放在党的建设的重要的突出的位置上。特别是当前要用四中全会的精神和小平同志几次讲话的精神统一全党的思想。反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，要长期坚持下去，而且要把这场斗争和增强党性观念的教育结合起来。要把被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的思想观点，包括在党的思想理论建设上造成的混乱一一纠正过来。有的同志提出，应把前一时期淡化党的领导的若干错误观念和违反马列主义的东西，综合归纳一下，加以澄清，我看这个意见很好。上次我们开教育会议，各大学正在编写教材。我们的教材要给学生讲清楚，为什么中国必须由中国共产党来领导，为什么必须实行社会主义制度。这两个问题，要从历史一直讲到现在，要把必然性讲清楚。这几年逢年过节，如五一劳动节、五四青年节、“一二·九”等，总有人借机制造事端，我看，经过这次制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱，要把坏事变成好事，今后大家都要振作起来。我认为首先就要像鲁迅讲的，在政治原则问题上要有脊梁骨，要挺起腰杆来，反对危害党、国家和人民利益的言行。我们要坚持改革开放，但必须抵制资产阶级腐朽思想。香港来的人讲，上海、北京的黄色书摊比香港还厉害，这是要贻害子孙后代的，对青年人的腐蚀很严重。“扫黄”，不单单是收他的书摊，首先是要挖他的根，他的那些黄色书刊是从哪里来的？对于思想阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然要去占领。这是千真万确的。最近许多学校开学了。大学新学期开学以后，学生入学报到率比较高，达到90％以上，有些因交通阻塞或生病不能来，都来电报请假。到校以后，一般都上一段时间思想教育课，和其他课程一样，不上课，就算旷课。因此，缺席少，出勤率比较高。这些学生来校后，思想状况总的比较好，这与大形势，与国家、社会和家人的教育分不开。所以，从现在开始，要牢记我们肩膀上有这样一个责任，就是用无产阶级思想教育青年。这些青年人是我们的希望和未来，将来要接班的。长江后浪赶前浪，世人新人换旧人嘛！所以要加强思想教育工作，今后要主动去做，要用无产阶级思想占领阵地。
    党内要进行批评与自我批评，开展党内思想斗争。思想斗争也多年不讲了，其实，思想斗争不是无限上纲，是打扫灰尘嘛！一些不健康的思想，通过批评与自我批评，可以防微杜渐。我们平时对党员要求严格一点，经常打扫灰尘，对克服错误思想有很大好处，对分清是非、统一认识、增强党的团结也是有好处的。
    思想建设中，要提倡学点哲学，特别是在党员领导干部队伍中要加强学习。我们中央常委正在准备学习规划，至少学习两个方面的东西。一个是哲学。我看长期以来，我们忽视了学习马克思主义哲学，特别是唯物辩证法。唯心主义和形而上学的思想方法还有一定市场，往往从一个极端走向另一个极端，思想片面，对事物的本质往往把握不住。这与领导者的哲学水平不够有关。另一个是政治经济学。要强调结合我们当前实际生活中所遇到的一些问题，正确运用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法来认识问题。今后在社会科学理论方面，你可以有这样或那样的观点，但有一条是不能变的，是要统一的，就是都要用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法观察问题。共产党员的指导思想、方法论必须是马克思主义的。这条不能变。
    我就讲这五条意见。有错误的地方，请大  家批评指正。
