	Soviet Marshal Akhromeyev said today in an article in *Pravda* that Soviet-American arms reduction talks should include the naval forces of both sides.

	He said that in East-West arms reduction talks, naval forces are the most important issue for Soviet security. However, due to the obstruction by the U.S. side, the two sides have not held talks on reducing naval forces. The reason is that the U.S. has significantly more military strength and equipment at sea than the Soviet Union.

	According to figures provided by Akhromeyev, the U.S. Navy has 1.5 times more major surface vessels (battleships, cruisers, destroyers, missile cruisers) than the Soviet Union. The U.S. has 15 attack aircraft carriers, while the Soviet Union has none. The U.S. Navy's aircraft are 1.5 times more numerous than the Soviet Union's, and the total tonnage of U.S. vessels is double that of the Soviet Union. In terms of the number of marines, the U.S. has 18 times more than the Soviet Union.

	This Soviet marshal pointed out that the U.S. intends to continue using these advantages to pressure and threaten the Soviet Union.

　　苏美裁军谈判应包括海军
    新华社莫斯科10月30日电  苏联元帅阿赫罗梅耶夫今天在《真理报》上撰文指出，苏美裁军谈判应包括双方海军力量。
    他说，在东西方裁军谈判中，海军力量是苏联安全的最主要问题；但是由于美国方面的抵制，苏美双方没有举行关于削减海军力量的谈判，原因是美国在海上的军事力量和装备大大超过苏联。
    据阿赫罗梅耶夫提供的数字，美国海军拥有的大型水上舰只（主力舰、巡洋舰、驱逐舰、导弹巡航舰）比苏联多1.5倍；美国的攻击型航空母舰有15艘，而苏联一艘也没有；美国海军航空兵的飞机比苏联多1.5倍，在舰只的总吨数方面多一倍，在海军陆战队人数上比苏联多18倍。
    这位苏联元帅指出，美国企图继续利用这些优势对苏联施加压力和威胁苏联。
