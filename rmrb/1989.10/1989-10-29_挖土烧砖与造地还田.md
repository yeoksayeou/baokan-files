The amount of land occupied by excavating soil for brick making is not small. If we do not take measures to stop and control it, the consequences will be dire. The key is for those involved to actively find solutions. For example, combining soil excavation for brick making with land reclamation is a good strategy. Over the past 20 years, the Second Building Materials Factory in Jinan, Shandong Province, has excavated and occupied 2000 mu (approximately 133.3 hectares) of land. They have reclaimed 1850 mu of land, achieving a land reclamation rate of 92.5%, leading the nation. In September of this year, they were awarded the title of "National Land Reclamation Advanced Unit" by the State Land Administration and the National Brick and Tile Association.

This factory is the largest red brick producer in Shandong Province, with an annual output of 60 million red bricks. Since 1969, they have been excavating soil from outside the factory. They insist on excavating soil in the hilly areas around the factory, which are uneven. Before excavating, they conduct on-site surveys, fully consult with farmers, and sign contracts. To expand the arable land, they insist on excavating soil from high slopes, filling in gullies, and leveling dry ditches and barren hillsides into farmland. Farmers happily say, "The original hilly land has now become flat fertile fields, and the mountainous land that could not be irrigated can now be watered for farming. The worker comrades have truly done a good deed for us."

　　山东省济南市　曹进
    挖土烧砖侵占的土地不是个小数目，不想办法制止约束，后果不堪设想，关键是当事人要积极想办法。例如，把挖土烧砖与造地还田结合起来，就是一良策。济南第二建材厂20年来挖占土地2000亩，他们通过造地还田1850亩，土地复垦率达到92.5％，居全国领先水平，今年9月，被国家土地管理局和全国砖瓦协会授予“全国土地复垦先进单位”称号。
    这个厂是山东省最大的红砖生产厂家，年产红砖6000万块。1969年开始从厂外采土以来，他们坚持在厂区周围高低不平的丘陵地上挖土。在挖土前，先现场考察，充分协商后与农民签订合同。为了扩大耕种面积，他们坚持在高坡处取土，将沟壑填平，把多年干涸的水沟、荒山坡平整为农田。农民高兴地说：“原来的丘陵地现在变成了平坦的良田，原来不能浇水的山坡地现在能引水浇田了，工人老大哥真为我们办了件好事。”
