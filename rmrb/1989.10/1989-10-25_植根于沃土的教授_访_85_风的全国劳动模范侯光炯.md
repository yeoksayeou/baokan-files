Professor Rooted in Fertile Soil – Interview with National Labor Model Hou Guangxun of the 1985 Spirit

By Wei Yanan, Reporter for People's Daily

Leaving home to carry a handful of hometown soil; returning home to embrace the native soil. People's feelings for the soil run deep, even comparing the land to their own mother.

But who understands the soil as well as Professor Hou Guangxun?

Hou Guangxun is 85 years old this year. He is a professor of soil science at Southwest Agricultural University and has dedicated his life to the study of soil science. Half a century ago, he was the first to represent China's soil science community at the International Soil Science Society. Over the past decade, he has focused on the research of natural no-till technology, achieving groundbreaking results. Recently, UNESCO specially invited him to write an article to introduce this. Currently, this achievement has been promoted in 13 provinces across the country, covering over 22 million mu (approximately 14.67 million acres), with an average increase in yield of around 15%, and a direct economic benefit of 1 billion yuan. For this, Professor Hou was awarded the National May Day Labor Medal, and recently, as a national labor model, he attended the commendation conference.

Exceptional, Yet Not Exceptional

During the labor model conference, the reporter interviewed this elderly professor. His hearing is excellent, and he wears thick glasses. When talking, he is very focused but also humorous.

Hearing that he is the oldest among the 2,800 national labor models, Professor Hou quickly waved his hands, saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm old and not useful anymore." However, this is not his true sentiment. In reality, he is far from admitting defeat. At this age, he still insists on living in the countryside to conduct research, far away from his home in a big city. This time, to attend the national heroes' conference in Beijing, he came directly from Longning County, Sichuan Province, where he was conducting soil surveys and experiments. Even on the train, he was busy writing papers.

To prove that he is still in good health, Professor Hou told the reporter that he runs every day for exercise. He even stood up to demonstrate, bending down to touch his heels. He humorously told the reporter, "You can write in your article that this old man is an exception among labor models, but also not an exception." The old man, though aged, is not content with a life of ease and comfort. Before liberation, he traveled throughout the country, collecting a large amount of firsthand materials and creating soil research methods, laying the foundation for the development of soil science in China. After liberation, he taught and educated students while participating in soil surveys and agricultural planning activities. He led his students twice into the dense forests of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, to find suitable land for rubber plantations, developing rubber cultivation and making Xishuangbanna the second rubber production base after Hainan Island. During the Cultural Revolution, although he was labeled a "reactionary academic authority," he never stopped thinking about soil science. In 1972, he helped solve the problem of olive wilt disease causing seedling death in Chongqing's Songling Mountain. Later, he led his students to establish a science and technology base in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, conducting research on more than 20 agricultural projects and promoting soil improvement techniques, increasing grain production by over 100 million jin (approximately 500 million kilograms). Since then, this professor has lived among farmers in rural areas.

There is Suffering, But Also Sweetness

Professor Hou has dedicated his life to agricultural research, but none of his five children studied agriculture, which makes him feel a bit regretful. He said, "I don't give up hope. I want my grandson, who is about to graduate from high school, to apply to an agricultural university. The grandson refused, choosing to study medicine instead, saying that my field is too hard and only fools would do it!" The old professor sighed, "This is understandable. Farming is hard work, and it doesn't earn much money!"

But he himself doesn't mind these things. As Professor Hou puts it, "I have been through hardships." At the reporter's request, he shared a few examples of his hardships:

Once, while surveying the Loess Plateau, he was both thirsty and hungry. When he went to a farmer's house for water, he was given a bowl of dishwashing water. It turned out that water was so scarce there that each well was dozens of meters deep, and it took half a day to draw a bucket of water.

In the Qinling Mountains, he was surveying clay soil, and there was not a soul in sight. He sang to himself to boost his courage and to scare away wild animals. Suddenly, he felt a void in front of him—it was a cliff! He narrowly avoided falling off.

Another time, while camping outdoors, he was surrounded by a pack of wolves and barely escaped...

"There is suffering, but also sweetness," Professor Hou did not want to elaborate further, using this phrase to transition. Where is the sweetness? Mainly, it is the scientific nourishment he gained from these experiences. He believes that no matter how many personal achievements one has, they are all thanks to the farmers. Generation after generation of Chinese farmers, who have toiled on the land, possess an inexhaustible treasure trove of scientific knowledge.

In the 1950s, after the national soil survey was completed, he went to Beijing to report on his paper. Others wrote one and submitted it, then left. He also wrote one but was not satisfied. He pondered and rewrote it, becoming so anxious that he couldn't eat or sleep, and his eyes became inflamed due to stress. His three children cried around him, fearing he would overwork himself to death. In his deep thoughts, a farmer's saying, "Good crops love warm soil," inspired him. He realized the relationship between temperature and soil ecology and finally wrote a renowned paper.

Going Abroad, But Not Leaving the Country

Just as humans are inseparable from the land, Professor Hou Guangxun, who comes from a farming family, has been closely tied to the land and farmers since childhood. When he was about to start elementary school, his father was driven to death by a landlord. The farmers tied up the landlord and brought him to the victim's body to confess, also helping Hou Guangxun with his education. To repay the farmers, Hou Guangxun entered an agricultural school, wanting to use science to help farmers produce more grain and escape poverty. He told the reporter, "When I was admitted to Beijing Agricultural University, there were still no soil scientists in the country. I had to study soil science. My teacher introduced me to an American-run soil research room to conduct soil surveys." But he soon found that the foreigners' methods were not practical for China, so he conducted his own research on rice soils and presented a paper internationally. Thus, more than ten countries invited him to be a visiting scholar. In the 1930s, Professor Hou visited Britain, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Hungary, Germany, the United States, and other countries for inspections.

During this period, some countries wanted to keep him abroad for research, offering him a doctorate, a salary, and even work clothes, but he politely declined. He told his foreign friends, "Your soil science is advanced, but China is still backward. I want to go back and serve the Chinese farmers." With this resolve, he returned with the paper "Similarities and Differences Between European and American Soils and Chinese Soils."

To express his indignation towards those who were then worshipping foreign things, Professor Hou shaved his head upon returning from abroad and changed his Western suit for a blue cotton gown. As the director of the Soil Research Institute, he did not advocate for research topics unrelated to production and did not publish papers that were detached from reality. Like the diligent farmers, he focused his research on the land that nurtured him. In addition to research, he also hung a sign reading "Science and Technology Consulting Service Center" in Longning County, promoting agricultural technology and using his own money to reply to inquiries and send materials to people from all over the country.

He knows that his life will not be long. After the labor model conference, Professor Hou declined his daughter's repeated invitations to stay in Beijing and hurried back to his research institute in the countryside.

　　植根于沃土的教授
　　——访85风的全国劳动模范侯光炯
　　本报记者  魏亚南
    远走他乡，揣一把家乡土；重归故里，亲一亲故乡土。人们对土壤的感情可谓深矣，甚至把土地同自己的母亲相比拟。
    然而，有谁能像侯光炯教授这样了解土地呢？
    侯光炯今年85岁了，是西南农业大学土壤学教授，一生从事土壤科学的研究。半个世纪前，他第一个代表中国土壤科学界在国际土壤学会上发言。近十多年来，他致力于自然免耕技术的研究，取得了开创性的成果，前不久，联合国教科文组织专门请他著文加以介绍。目前，这项成果已在国内13个省推广2200多万亩，平均增产幅度15％左右，直接经济效益可达10亿元。为此，侯教授获得全国“五一”劳动奖章，最近又作为全国劳动模范出席了表彰大会。
    例外，又不例外
    劳模会期间，记者采访了这位老教授。他的听力非常好，戴着深度近视镜，谈起话来十分专注，却又不无诙谐。
    听说自己是2800名全国劳模中年纪最长者，侯老连忙摆手说：“不好意思，不好意思！老了，不中用了。”然而，这可不是他的真心话，实际上他才不服老呢！这般大年纪了，他仍然远离大城市的家，坚持住在乡下搞科研。这次赴京参加全国群英会，他就是从做土壤调查和实验的四川省长宁县来的，在车上还一路不闲地赶写论文。
    为了证实身体尚好，侯老告诉记者，他每天都跑步锻炼，说着还要站起来作示范，弯腰用手去摸脚后跟。他还风趣地对记者说：“你笔下可以来两句，说我这个老头子，是劳模中的例外，但又不例外。”老人年迈，却不甘于养尊处优。解放前，他就跑遍了祖国大江南北，调查收集了大量第一手材料，创建了土壤研究法，为发展我国的土壤学奠定了基础。解放后，他一边教书育人，一边参加土壤普查和农业规划活动，曾两次带领师生在云南西双版纳密林里跋涉，寻找橡胶宜林地，开发种植橡胶，使西双版纳成了继海南岛之后的第二个橡胶生产基地。“文化大革命”中，他虽然被打成“反动学术权威”，却始终没有停止对土壤学的思考，1972年，便帮助解决了重庆歌乐山的橄榄青枯病引起的死苗问题，继而又带领师生在四川省简阳县建立了科技基地，开展了20多项农业课题研究，推广改土技术，使当地粮食增产上亿斤。从此，这位教授一直生活在农村和农民中间。
    有苦，也有甜
    侯老搞了一辈子农业科研，五个儿女却没有一个是学农业的，使老人感到有些遗憾。他说：“我不死心，想让应届高中毕业的孙子报考农大，孙子不肯，学医去了。还说我这行太苦了，傻瓜才干呢！”老教授感慨地说：“这也难怪，务农挨累不算，还赚不到大钱！”
    而他本人却不在乎这些，用侯老的话说：“我是苦过来了。”应记者请求，他举了几个吃苦的例子：
    一次在黄土高原考察，又渴又饿，到一户农民家找水喝，给他的却只是一碗刷锅水。原来这儿太缺水了，每口井有几十丈深，提一桶水得用小半天。
    在秦岭山上调查泥巴土，漫山遍野没一个人影，他一路唱歌为自己壮胆，同时吓唬山里的野兽。走着走着，突然感到眼前一片空虚，啊呀，悬崖！好险没有掉下去。
    还有一次，露宿野外，被狼群包围，好不容易才得脱身……
      “有苦也有甜呀。”侯老不愿多说下去，用这句话来个转折。甜在哪儿呢？主要是从中吸取了科学的营养。他认为，个人成果再多，也是沾了农民的光。世世代代劳作在土地上的中国农民，有着取之不尽的科学宝藏。
    50年代，全国土壤普查完毕，他到北京作论文汇报，别人写了一个月交卷走了。他也写了一篇却不满意。琢磨重写，弄得吃不下、睡不好，眼睛也由于着急上火患了结膜炎。三个孩子围着哭，怕他累死了。瞑思苦想中，农民一句口头禅“好庄稼喜爱热性土”启发了他，意识到温度与土壤生态的关系，终于写出了一篇叫响的论文。
    出国，却不去国
    像人类与土地密不可分一样，侯光炯这位出身农家的教授，从小就与土地和农民结下了不解之缘。他快上小学时，父亲被地主逼死了。农民们把地主捆绑起来，到被害者尸前认罪，还资助他上学。为了感激农民，侯光炯进了农校，想用科学帮助农民多打粮，摆脱苦难。他告诉记者：“我考入北京农大时，国内还没有搞土壤学的人。我一定要学土壤，老师便介绍我到美国人办的土壤研究室搞土壤调查。”但很快他就发现，外国人那一套脱离中国实际，便自己单搞了一套水稻土的研究，在国际上宣读了论文。于是，十几个国家邀请他去作旅行学者。30年代，侯教授先后去过英国、瑞典、苏联、匈牙利、德国、美国等地考察。
    这期间，一些国家要留他在国外搞科研，有的不单授予他博士学位，还给他开了工资，甚至发了工作服，但都被他婉言谢绝了。他对外国朋友说：“你们的土壤科学是发达的，可是中国还很落后，我要回去为中国农民服务。”就这样，他带着《欧美土壤与中国土壤的相同与不同》论文回来了。
    为了对当时的崇洋媚外者表示愤慨，从国外归来的侯教授剃光了头，并把西装换成了蓝布大褂。他担任土壤研究所所长，不提倡研究与生产不搭界的课题，也不发表那些脱离实际的论文，与勤勤恳恳耕耘的农民一样，把科研的重点放在养育他的这块土地上。除了搞科研外，他还在长宁县挂出了一块“科技咨询服务中心”的牌子，推广农业技术，并用自己的钱给全国各地的咨询者回信、寄资料。
    他知道，生命属于自己不会太久了。劳模会后，侯老谢绝了在京女儿的再三挽留，急急火火地赶回他那个在农村的研究所去了。
