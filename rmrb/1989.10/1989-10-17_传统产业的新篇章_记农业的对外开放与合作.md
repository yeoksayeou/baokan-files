In the eyes of many, China's agriculture is the oldest and most closed industry. Yet who would have thought that in terms of opening up to the outside world, agriculture has become one of the earliest and most successful sectors! In just a decade, Chinese agriculture has stepped out of the narrow confines of "front yard and back yard" and opened its doors to the world for exchange and cooperation.

Agriculture also needs to utilize foreign capital and seek foreign aid? At the beginning of the reform and opening up, many people had doubts: as a vast agricultural country, do we really need foreigners to teach us how to farm, and use foreign money to raise chickens and fish?

Later, as the door gradually opened, people's horizons also broadened. The result of being isolated from the world agricultural system for 30 years was that when most of our regions were still using traditional methods of farming with "a hoe and a seed," a series of new technological achievements such as remote sensing and biotechnology were revolutionizing world agriculture. Traditional agriculture and modern agriculture created production forces that were worlds apart. To narrow the gap, we had to make up our minds to learn from others and catch up.

After opening up, China successively introduced many advanced technologies and experiences from abroad, such as plastic film ground covering, mechanized high-yield rice cultivation, cage aquaculture, embryo transplantation, plastic greenhouses, straw ammoniation, high-efficiency low-toxicity pesticides, drip irrigation, and sprinkler irrigation. Many of these technologies have brought huge economic benefits.

The technology of ground covering with plastic film emerged in some developed countries in the mid-20th century with the development of the plastics industry. Yet until the mid-1970s, most Chinese farmers still did not know what plastic film was. In 1979, we introduced this technology from neighboring Japan. From hundreds of acres to tens of thousands of acres to millions of acres, in less than 10 years, the area covered by this technology in China has reached tens of millions of acres and is widely used in more than 40 crops such as corn, peanuts, vegetables, and cotton. This "white revolution" has increased production by more than 30% in vast areas of dry and cold regions, achieving unprecedented good harvests.

Pond aquaculture generally produces more than 500 kilograms per acre, while large-scale aquaculture produces only a few kilograms or tens of kilograms per acre. However, cage aquaculture, a new aquaculture technology that emerged in the world in the past 20 years, raises fish in high-density cages like caged chickens, using automated feeding and other methods to increase the utilization rate of feed. The current record for the highest yield per acre exceeds 90,000 kilograms. China introduced this technology only 10 years ago, and now it has been promoted in 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The cage aquaculture yield per acre in Beijing's Haizi Reservoir exceeds 70,000 kilograms, ranking first in the country.

To strengthen agriculture, we need to develop resources, improve conditions, introduce technology, and update equipment. But where does the money come from? After a decade of turmoil, the country was just recovering from a major illness, and everything was in ruins. How much money could be used for agriculture? To transform China's traditional agriculture into modern agriculture, we cannot do without external forces.

China's agriculture began to use foreign capital on a large scale in 1980. Now, we have economic and technological exchanges with more than 90 countries and have established long-term, stable agricultural cooperation relationships with some international professional organizations and more than 20 major countries. By 1988, agriculture had used foreign capital totaling more than $3 billion through various channels and methods. Of this, the Ministry of Agriculture alone used and accepted foreign capital and aid totaling $1.86 billion, and most of it was in the form of grants and medium- and long-term preferential loans. This considerable amount of "foreign" money made up for the shortage of domestic funds. Since most foreign capital requires a certain amount of matching funds from the domestic side, foreign aid also prompted the concentration of scattered domestic funds for a certain period to a certain region or project, thus significantly improving the use efficiency of funds.

In line with the national strategy of adjusting the industrial structure and developing key regions, hundreds of projects have been implemented in 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, covering agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, urban supply, rural construction, and intellectual development. Many of these projects have become key projects for China's agricultural infrastructure construction in recent years. The large-scale improvement of severely degraded grasslands in 8 counties (banners) in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei; the construction of four major demonstration ranches in Hunan's Nan Mountain, Hainan's Dongfang, Guangxi's Qianjiang, and Shanxi's Qin Water; the reclamation and transformation of 1 million acres of marshes and wastelands in the Sanjiang Plain; the canal system matching of large water conservancy projects in Gansu; the development of red soil areas in Jiangxi; the basin treatment of Miji in Shaanxi; and the rubber projects in Guangdong and freshwater aquaculture projects in 8 major cities... Each project has brought significant changes to these places.

In the past, some large cities in China faced a shortage of milk supply, making it difficult to guarantee milk for patients, the elderly, and infants. The World Food Program provided $64 million worth of milk powder and butter free of charge. We used the proceeds from the sale of these materials to support farms and farmers in developing dairy cows and expanding dairy processing capacity. In a few years, the dairy industry in the suburbs of cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai developed rapidly, and according to the current consumption level, the problem of "difficulty in getting milk" has been basically solved.

The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain has vast areas of low-yield fields that are prone to drought and waterlogging, and the local people have long been in a state of poverty. Relevant departments used a $60 million loan from the World Bank, plus domestic matching funds, to organize the people in 9 counties in Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces to dig wells, excavate canals, build irrigation and drainage stations, build bridges and roads, and plant trees and fruits. Comprehensive measures were taken to transform 3 million acres of saline-alkali land and sandy-black soil. In 5 years, the yield per acre of grain, cotton, and oil increased by onefold, and farmers' per capita income increased from less than 200 yuan to more than 400 yuan, solving the problem of basic subsistence. Currently, they are using the recovered $90 million to start new agricultural development projects.

Along with the funds, a large amount of high-efficiency fertilizers and pesticides, advanced and practical agricultural machinery, agricultural product processing equipment, mechanized poultry and rabbit farming equipment, as well as lean meat pigs, long-haired rabbits, African carp, scallops, and other superior breeds were introduced.

A batch of advanced instruments and equipment with world-leading levels have been equipped in 9 key agricultural research centers and 7 key agricultural colleges nationwide; more than 2,600 students and nearly 500 agricultural visiting scholars have been sent to more than a dozen countries to study, train, and conduct cooperative research; in practice, China's own project management team is also growing... These may not be measurable by short-term economic indicators, but they will undoubtedly have a more profound impact on the development of China's agriculture.

Opening up and cooperation are not just about introducing foreign capital; agriculture's opening up is also about both importing and exporting. In 10 years of reform, while we have used a large amount of foreign capital in rural areas, the foreign exchange earning capacity of various industries in rural areas has also been greatly enhanced. While ensuring self-sufficiency in large quantities of agricultural products such as grain, we have begun to participate in international exchanges and adjust varieties. Export bases for various named, special, superior, and new agricultural products (including livestock and aquatic products) are scattered throughout the country.

According to incomplete statistics, in 1988, the export of agricultural products and their processed products accounted for 44% of the total export trade procurement value of the country.

It is particularly worth mentioning that township enterprises have become an important force in China's export earnings, with tens of thousands of labor-intensive products entering the international market. By 1988, the total export earnings and labor service income of township enterprises in the country had reached $8 billion, accounting for 16.8% of the total export earnings of the country.

Some economically developed regions have begun to transform their rural economic structure into an outward-looking one. The "three resources" enterprises and "three-in-one" businesses of the agricultural sector in some coastal provinces and cities have developed rapidly.

China not only exports "hardware" but also "software." Especially in the field of biotechnology, we have our own advantages. Japan cooperates with us to conduct rice hybridization in Yunnan, which is rich in varieties, to select high-yield, disease-resistant, and cold-resistant new varieties; China's hybrid rice technology, which is at the forefront of the world, has been transferred to the United States as a patent; China Seed Company cooperates with foreign countries to breed hybrid seeds of melons and solanaceous crops and sells them to third countries.

To let the unique technology created by the Chinese people benefit humanity, China cooperates with the United Nations Development Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and others to establish some agricultural professional technology international training centers in the country to cultivate specialized talents for developing countries.

Some countries have seen Chinese farmers establishing farms, and the Soviet Union has also left the footprints of Chinese experts in vegetable and melon cultivation. China has successively sent thousands of resident experts and staff to developing countries in Africa and other regions to undertake and implement hundreds of agricultural development projects. China's biological control, tea cultivation, and intercropping and relay cropping techniques have been promoted in many countries.

Chinese agriculture has stepped out of its closed state and is marching towards a new era of vast horizons!

    传统产业的新篇章
    ——记农业的对外开放与合作
    本报记者　江夏
    在许多人眼中，我国的农业是最古老、最封闭的产业。可是谁能想到，在对外开放方面，农业，居然成为起步最早、成就最显著的部门之一！不过10年功夫，中国农业已经走出“房前屋后”的狭小天地，向全世界敞开了交流合作之门。
    （一）
    农业也要利用外资、争取外援？！改革开放之初，不少人对此疑虑重重：泱泱农业大国，难道侍弄庄稼，还要“洋”人教，喂鸡养鱼还要用“洋”钱吗？
    尔后，大门渐启，人们的眼界也随之开阔。30年独立于世界农业体系之外的结果是，当我们的大部分地区还用“一把锄、一把籽”的传统方式耕作的时候，遥感技术、生物工程等一系列层出不穷的科技新成果正给世界农业带来革命性的变化。传统农业与现代农业创造的生产力天差地别。要缩小距离，只有下决心学人之长，奋起直追。
    开放之后，我国陆续从国外引进了塑料薄膜地面覆盖、水稻机械化高产栽培、网箱养鱼、胚胎移植、塑料大棚、秸秆氨化、高效低毒农药、滴灌喷灌等许多先进技术经验。有不少技术已带来巨大的经济效益。
    地膜覆盖技术，本世纪中叶就已经随着塑料工业的发展在一些发达国家兴起。可是直到70年代中，我国多数农民还不知道地膜为何物。1979年，我们才从东邻日本引进了这项技术。几百亩，几万亩，几百万亩，不足10年，我国目前年推广面积已达数千万亩，并且广泛应用于玉米、花生、瓜菜、棉花等40多种作物。这场“白色革命”，使我国处于干旱、高寒地区的大片中、低产田以30％以上的幅度增产，获得从未有过的好收成。
    池塘养鱼，一般亩产500公斤以上就算高产，大水面养殖，亩产才几公斤、几十公斤。而网箱养鱼，这种世界近20年来新出现的养鱼技术，像笼养鸡一样地把鱼高密度地养在网箱内，用自动化投料等方式，提高饲料的利用率，目前亩产最高纪录已超过9万公斤。我国引进这项技术也不过10年，现在已经在19个省、市、区推广。北京海子水库网箱养鱼亩产超过7万公斤，居全国之首。
    （二）
    加强农业，要开发资源，改善条件，引进技术，更新设备。可是钱从哪儿来呢？10年动乱之后，国家大病初愈，百废待兴，能有多少钱用到农业上？要使我国的传统农业向现代农业转变，外力不可不借。
    我国农业较大规模地利用外资自1980年始，现在，已与90多个国家有了经济技术方面的交往，先后与一些国际专业机构和20多个主要国家建立了长期稳定的农业合作关系。到1988年，农业通过多条渠道、多种方式利用外资总额达30多亿美元，其中仅农业部牵头利用和接受的外资、外援就达18.6亿美元，而且大部分是无偿援助和中、长期优惠贷款。这笔数量可观的“洋”钱，弥补了国内资金的不足。因大多外资都需要国内一定数量的配套资金，所以外援又促使分散的国内资金在一定时期内，集中用于某个地区某个项目，从而明显地提高了资金的使用效益。
    与国家调整产业结构、开发重点地区的宏观战略相结合，数百个项目在全国27个省、市、自治区实施，涉及农林牧副渔、城市供应、乡村建设、智力开发等各个方面。许多已成为近年来我国农业基本建设的骨干项目。黑龙江、内蒙古、河北三省（区）8个县（旗）严重退化草场的大面积改良；湖南南山、海南东方、广西黔江、山西沁水四大示范牧场的建设；三江平原低洼易涝的百万亩沼泽、荒地开垦改造；甘肃大型水利工程的渠系配套；江西红壤土地带的开发；陕西米脂的流域治理；还有广东的橡胶项目、8大城市的淡水养鱼项目……每个项目的实施都给这些地方带来明显变化。
    过去，我国一些大城市牛奶供应紧张，连病人、老者、婴孩的用奶都难于保证，世界粮食计划署无偿提供了价值6400万美元的奶粉、黄油，我们用这批物资的销售收入扶持农场、农民发展奶牛，扩大乳品加工能力。几年时间，京、津、沪等一些大城市郊区奶牛业迅速发展，按照目前的消费水平，“吃奶难”问题已基本解决。
    黄淮海平原大片低产田易旱易涝，群众生活长期窘困。有关方面利用世界银行的6000万美元贷款，加上国内配套资金在山东、河南、安徽的3省9县，组织群众打井、挖渠、建排灌站、造桥修路、植树种果，采取综合治理措施改造了300万亩盐碱地和砂礓黑土。5年间，粮、棉、油亩产提高了1倍，农民人均收入从不足200元增加到400元以上，温饱问题已得到解决。目前，他们又用回收的9000多万元资金，搞起了新的农业开发项目。
      与资金同时引进的还有大量高效化肥、农药，先进、实用的农业机械，农产品加工、机械化养鸡、养兔等设备以及瘦肉型猪、长毛兔、非洲鲫鱼、扇贝等良种。
    一批具有世界先进水平的仪器设备，在全国重点装备了9个农业科研中心和7个重点农业院校；2600多名留学生、近500名农业访问学者被派到十几个国家学习、进修和合作研究；在实践中，我国自己的项目管理队伍也在成长……这些虽然难以用一时的经济指标衡量，但必将对我国农业的发展产生更加深刻影响。
    （三）
    开放合作，并非单向引进；农业对外开放也是有进有出。改革10年，我们把大笔外资用在农村的同时，农村各业自身的创汇能力也大大加强。粮食等大宗农产品在总量基本自给的情况下，开始参与国际交换，进行品种调剂。以各种名、特、优、新产品为主的出口农产品（包括畜产品、水产品）基地星罗棋布，遍及全国。
    据不完全统计，1988年农产品及其加工产品的出口已占国家出口贸易收购总额的44％。
    特别值得一提的是，乡镇企业成为我国出口创汇的一支重要力量，成千上万种劳动密集型产品进入国际市场。到1988年，全国乡镇企业直接或间接出口创汇额和劳务收入已达80亿美元，占全国出口创汇总额的16.8％。
    一部分经济发达地区的农村经济结构开始向外向型转化。沿海一些省市农口的“三资”企业和“三来一补”业务发展很迅速。
      我国输出的不仅是“硬”件，而且有“软”件。特别在生物技术方面，我们有自己的优势。日本与我合作，在品种资源丰富的云南进行水稻杂交，选育高产、抗病、耐寒的新品种；我国居于世界领先地位的杂交水稻技术已经作为专利转让给了美国；中国种子公司与国外合作繁殖瓜类、茄果类杂交种子，向第三国销售。
    为了让我国劳动人民创造的独特技术造福于人类，我国同联合国开发计划署、粮农组织等合作，在国内建立了一些农业专业技术国际培训中心，为发展中国家培养专门人才。
    有的国家已出现了中国农民办起的农场，苏联也留下了我国种菜种瓜能手的足迹。我国先后派出数千名常驻专家和工作人员，在非洲等地区的发展中国家承担、实施了数百项农业发展项目。我国的生物防治、茶叶栽培，间作套种制等许多技术已经在不少国家推广。
    中国农业已走出封闭，向天宽地阔的新时代迈进！
