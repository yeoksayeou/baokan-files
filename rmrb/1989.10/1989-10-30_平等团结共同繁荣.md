Our great People's Republic of China has celebrated its 40th anniversary. Over the past 40 years, our Party has adhered to the combination of Marxism-Leninism's national theory with China's national realities, explored for a long time, and formulated a set of effective national policies, thus charting a correct path with Chinese characteristics to solve domestic national issues. Just like other aspects of the Party's work, national work has advanced by summing up achievements and correcting mistakes. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, after rectifying past errors, the Party's national policies have been restored and developed. Under the guidance of the basic line of "one center, two basic points," the guiding ideology, fundamental tasks, and policies of national work in the new period have been further clarified. The faces of minority nationalities and national regions have undergone profound historical changes, and China's socialist national relations have been further consolidated and developed.

With the implementation of the system of regional ethnic autonomy, the construction of national legal systems has been continuously strengthened. In 1984, China officially promulgated the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy," marking the entry of China's national legal system construction into a new period. Since then, 20 autonomous prefectures and 23 autonomous counties have promulgated and implemented autonomous regulations, playing a guarantee role in implementing regional ethnic autonomy.

Great achievements have been made in the economic and cultural construction of ethnic regions. In 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value of all national autonomous regions reached 109.2 billion yuan, 20 times that of 1949. In the past 10 years, the total industrial and agricultural output value has grown at an annual rate of 10%, exceeding the average annual growth rate of 6.6% during the 28 years from the First Five-Year Plan to the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

Reviewing the great achievements of national work, we deeply feel that to do a good job in national work and achieve equality, unity, and common prosperity among all nationalities, we must adhere to the four cardinal principles as the foundation of the state; we must adhere to the correct path of regional ethnic autonomy; we must adhere to the principle of starting from reality, proceeding cautiously, and providing classified guidance; we must adhere to the fundamental stance of common prosperity among all nationalities. Recently, General Secretary Jiang Zemin, in his speech at the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China, affirmed the achievements of national work, emphasized the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country and the importance of national issues, expounded on the Party's national policies, and pointed out the tasks of national work in the future. We must study and understand the spirit of the speeches by central leaders, continue to comprehensively implement the Party's basic line, and strive to do a good job in the current national work.

	(1) **Vigorously Develop the Economic and Cultural Undertakings of Minority Nationalities and Minority Regions.** China's minority regions are rich in resources and have many advantages and great potential for development. However, resource advantages are not yet real economic advantages. In the future, the development of minority regions must firmly take the path of reform. Generally speaking, the reform in minority regions is consistent with the national reform, but in specific implementation, it must start from the characteristics and realities of minority nationalities and minority regions. In the process of implementing the policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying economic order, and deepening comprehensive reform, we must be both active and resolute, and cautious and steady, distinguish between priorities and urgency, and achieve appropriate speed. The opening-up of minority regions started late, and although the closed and semi-closed state has begun to be broken, the degree of opening-up is still insufficient. While continuing to expand the opening-up to the east and south, we should actively open up to the west and north to neighboring countries.

	(2) **Seriously Implement the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy and Further Improve the System of Regional Ethnic Autonomy.** The "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" is a fundamental law of the state with universal binding force, and all units, departments, organizations, and individuals must abide by it. We must strengthen the legal system construction that matches the autonomy law. In addition to relevant departments formulating and implementing the supporting regulations of the autonomy law, local governments should formulate and implement local regulations for the autonomy law, and those that have been formulated should be further improved in conjunction with new situations. This task is heavy, and all levels of national work departments should actively cooperate with relevant parties to grasp it and form a relatively systematic national legal system, and gradually improve the supervision mechanism for the enforcement and observance of the autonomy law.

	Reasonably adjust the economic interests between the state and autonomous regions, guarantee the economic rights of autonomous regions, and strengthen the state's support and assistance for the economic and cultural construction of autonomous regions, which is an important part of implementing the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy." The state should welcome and actively assist in the development and construction in autonomous regions. Higher-level state organs should formulate preferential policies and take effective measures to provide effective support and assistance to autonomous regions in economics, education, science and technology, culture, health, sports, and other aspects, and drive local development. Attention should be paid to the national work in scattered and mixed residential areas, and the regulations on the work of ethnic townships and other relevant regulations should be formulated as soon as possible to guarantee the rights of minority nationalities in scattered and mixed residential areas.

	(3) **Strengthen the Education of National Policies and National Unity to Further Consolidate and Develop Socialist National Relations.** We must adhere to the four cardinal principles, strengthen ideological and political work, including the propaganda and education of the Party's national policies and national unity. Through education, we should enable cadres of all ethnic groups to be familiar with and master the basic knowledge of the Party's national theory and national policies, establish the basic concept of socialist national relations and national legal awareness, so as to increase mutual understanding and support among the people of all ethnic groups, and treat each other equally and live in harmony in all aspects of social life.

	We should properly handle problems in national relations. Most national relation problems are internal issues among the people, and should be properly solved in the spirit of equality, unity, mutual understanding, and mutual accommodation, through criticism and self-criticism, and in the track of democracy and the rule of law.

	To develop a new type of national relations, we must also carry out extensive cultural exchanges among all ethnic groups to create a good environment and conditions for inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditional cultures of all ethnic groups. We must adhere to the principle of equality in the use and development of the languages and scripts of all ethnic groups, earnestly implement the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief, and respect the customs and habits of all ethnic groups.

	(4) **Maintain National Unity and Maintain a Stable and United Political Situation.** We should recognize that under socialist conditions, class struggle still exists to a certain extent and will reflect on national relations under certain conditions. A small number of stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization and national separatist elements are consistent in selling national interests. In his speech at the national conference on poverty alleviation work in minority regions, General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Now, domestic separatist elements and some anti-China forces abroad are stirring. Domestic and foreign reactionary forces are colluding with each other, indeed forming a chorus of anti-China and anti-communism. We must closely watch the activities of separatist elements and never relax our vigilance." We must resolutely expose and strike those who take advantage of the opening-up, under the banner of nationality, religion, and human rights, to attempt to split the motherland and overthrow the socialist system, and we will not be lenient.

	China's minority nationalities have deeply felt from their own experiences that adhering to the four cardinal principles, maintaining national unity, and maintaining a stable and united political situation are the prerequisite for the common progress and prosperity of all ethnic groups. Without this prerequisite, nothing can be discussed. We must consciously shoulder the historical responsibility of maintaining the overall situation of national unity, constantly enhance the centripetal force and cohesion of all ethnic groups for the socialist motherland, and make new contributions to the prosperity and strength of the great motherland created by all ethnic groups with practical actions.

　　平等团结共同繁荣
　　国家民委副主任　伍精华
    我们伟大的中华人民共和国成立40周年了。40年来，我们党坚持把马列主义民族理论和中国民族实际相结合，经过长期的探索，制定了一整套行之有效的民族政策，走出了一条具有中国特色的解决国内民族问题的正确道路。民族工作同党的其它方面的工作一样，是在发扬成绩，纠正失误中不断前进的。党的十一届三中全会以后，经过拔乱反正，党的民族政策得到了恢复和发展。在“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线指引下，新时期民族工作的指导思想、根本任务和方针政策进一步明确，少数民族和民族地区的面貌发生了历史性的深刻变化，我国社会主义民族关系得到进一步巩固和发展。
    随着民族区域自治制度的实施，民族法制建设不断加强。1984年，我国正式颁布了《民族区域自治法》，标志着我国民族法制建设进入一个新的时期。之后，已有20个自治州、23个自治县颁布实施了自治条例，对实施民族区域自治起到了保障作用。
    民族地方的经济文化建设取得巨大成就。1988年，全国民族自治地方工农业总产值达到1092亿元，比1949年增长了20倍。近10年，工农业总产值每年以10％的速度增长，超过了“一五”到“五五”计划28年间平均每年增长6.6％的速度。
    回顾民族工作取得的巨大成就，我们深深体会到，要做好民族工作，实现各民族的平等、团结和共同繁荣，必须坚持四项基本原则这个立国之本；必须坚持民族区域自治的正确道路；必须坚持从实际出发、慎重稳进、分类指导的原则；必须坚持各民族共同繁荣的根本立场。最近，江泽民总书记在国庆40周年大会上的讲话，肯定了民族工作的成就，强调了全国各族人民的大团结和民族问题的重要性，阐述了党的民族政策，并指出了今后民族工作的任务。我们要很好地学习领会中央领导同志的讲话精神，继续全面地贯彻党的基本路线，努力做好当前的民族工作。
      （一）大力发展少数民族和少数民族地区的经济文化事业。我国少数民族地区资源丰富，具有很多优势和巨大的发展潜力。但是资源优势还不是现实的经济优势。今后，少数民族地区的经济开发，必须坚定地走改革之路。从总体上讲，少数民族地区的改革同全国是一致的，但是具体实施中必须从少数民族和少数民族地区的特点和实际出发。在贯彻治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革方针的过程中，既要积极坚决，又要慎重稳妥，分清轻重缓急，做到快慢适度。少数民族地区的对外开放起步较晚，封闭半封闭的状态虽然已经开始打破，但开放的程度还很不够。应本着继续向东向南扩大开放的同时，积极向西向北对周边国家实行开放。
      （二）认真执行民族区域自治法，更好地完善民族区域自治制度。《民族区域自治法》作为国家的一项基本法律，具有普遍的约束力，一切单位、部门、团体和个人都必须遵守。要加强与自治法相配套的法制建设，除了有关部门制定实施自治法的配套法规外，各地要制定实施自治法的地方性法规，已经制定了的要结合新的情况进一步完善。这项工作任务很重，各级民族工作部门要积极会同有关方面抓紧进行，以便形成一个比较系统的民族法规体系，并逐步完善对自治法执法守法的监督机制。
    合理调整国家与民族自治地方的经济利益关系，保障民族自治地方的经济权益，加强国家对民族自治地方的经济文化建设的支持帮助，是执行《民族区域自治法》的一项重要内容。国家在民族自治地方开发建设，当地要热情欢迎、积极协助。上级国家机关要制定优惠政策，采取有效措施，在经济、教育、科技、文化、卫生、体育等方面都要对民族自治地方给予有效的扶持和帮助，带动当地的发展。要关心散杂居地区的民族工作，尽快制定民族乡工作条例和其它有关法规，保障散杂居地区少数民族的权益。
      （三）加强民族政策和民族团结教育，进一步巩固和发展社会主义的民族关系。要坚持四项基本原则，加强思想政治教育工作，其中包括进行党的民族政策和民族团结宣传教育。通过教育，使各族干部熟悉和掌握党的民族理论和民族政策的基本知识，树立社会主义民族关系的基本观念和民族法制意识，以增进各族人民之间的相互理解与支持，在社会生活的各个方面平等相待，友好相处。
    要妥善处理民族关系中的问题。民族关系问题大量的属于人民内部问题，要本着平等、团结、互谅互让的精神，通过批评与自我批评，在民主和法制的轨道上，妥善地加以解决。
    发展新型的民族关系还必须广泛进行各民族之间的文化交流，为继承和发扬各民族传统的优秀文化创造良好的环境和条件。要坚持各民族使用和发展本民族语言文字的平等原则，要认真贯彻党的宗教信仰自由政策，要尊重各民族的风俗习惯。
      （四）维护祖国统一，维护安定团结的政治局面。应当认识到，在社会主义条件下，阶级斗争还在一定范围内存在，在一定的条件下还会反映到民族关系上来。极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人与民族分裂主义分子在出卖民族利益方面是一致的。江泽民总书记在全国少数民族地区扶贫工作会议上讲话中指出：“现在，国内分裂主义分子以及国外的一些反华势力蠢蠢欲动。国内外反动势力互相勾结，确实形成了一股反华、反共的大合唱。对民族分裂主义分子的活动要密切加以注视，丝毫不能放松警惕”。我们对那些乘开放之机，打着民族、宗教和平等人权等旗号，妄图分裂祖国，颠覆社会主义制度的人要坚决进行揭露和打击，决不手软。
    我国少数民族从自己的亲身经历中深切体会到，坚持四项基本原则，维护祖国统一，维护安定团结的政治局面是各族人民共同进步、共同繁荣的前提条件。离开这个前提条件，一切无从谈起。我们要自觉担负起维护祖国统一大局的历史责任，不断增强各族人民对社会主义祖国的向心力和凝聚力，以实际行动为各民族人民共同创造的伟大祖国的繁荣昌盛做出新的贡献。
