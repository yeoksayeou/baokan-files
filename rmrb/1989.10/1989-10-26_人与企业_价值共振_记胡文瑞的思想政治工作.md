Hu Wenrui, the former director of the Second Oil Production Plant of Changqing Oilfield (recently appointed as the deputy director of Changqing Petroleum Bureau), actively explores the ideological and political work of the new era. He respects and cherishes the workers while also making strict demands on them, guiding the workers to achieve their self-worth in the process of realizing the enterprise's value. The workers call Hu Wenrui the "torch" of the Second Oil Production Plant.

Pursuing 1+1>2

Hu Wenrui does not deny the effectiveness of individual rewards, but he mainly focuses on changing people's minds, pursuing the best combination of people and people, and the overall effectiveness of 1+1>2 and the greatest possible synergy.

Hu Wenrui proposed the initiative of "cultivating team spirit," with the core being collectivism, where "small me" submits to "big me," and if necessary, sacrifices "small me" to complete "big me."

To cultivate everyone's collectivist consciousness, Hu Wenrui presided over the design of the factory emblem, which is worn on everyone's chest, and together with all the workers of the factory, formulated the factory's management principles, enterprise motto, and enterprise code. These norms coordinate everyone's behavior.

Building the Enterprise Cultural Environment

In response to the Second Oil Production Plant being located in a remote and desolate mountainous area and the cultural needs of workers in the new era, Hu Wenrui proposed the idea of building an enterprise cultural environment as early as 1985.

The Second Oil Production Plant gradually changed the previous monotonous lifestyle of working during the day and eating and sleeping after work, and carried out rich and varied extracurricular cultural activities. Every time the night falls, the cultural center of the Second Oil Production Plant is brightly lit, and the library, TV room, game hall are all filled with workers. The calligraphy and painting gallery and the heart-to-heart room are filled with laughter.

Hu Wenrui regards housing, canteens, and some cultural venues as the "golden triangle." He said: "This triangular area is very important. Workers spend most of their time outside of work hours in this triangle." He seriously grasps the construction of housing, canteens, and some cultural environments. He even manages the toilets. The Second Oil Production Plant has more than 70 public toilets, and he has visited almost all of them. In the five years since he took office, he has led the entire factory to carry out a 7-day toilet improvement activity every year. When he goes to subordinate units to inspect work, he often unexpectedly goes to the toilet to inspect. He said: The toilet reflects the level of civilization of a unit from one aspect, and the leader who cannot manage the toilet is also derelict in duty.

Shaping the Public Image

Hu Wenrui proposed the concept of "shaping the public image." He emphasized that this is especially important for leaders. This kind of tangible but silent guidance is more effective than giving many empty speeches.

The original party secretary of the factory, Han Zhiyuan, suffers from lumbar spine pain, and when the disease attacks, even breathing hurts, but he still often travels on winding mountain roads and mingles with frontline workers. The successor, Party Secretary Chen Jinhua, was diagnosed with cancer in November 1988. When the organization decided that he should go to Xi'an for treatment, he led his wife to the office, handing over item by item, which items belong to the public, and should be properly kept... His wife recorded each item with tears.

At the workers' representative conference held in January this year, the representatives proposed to reward Hu Wenrui and his several deputies. After discussion, it was decided to reward Hu Wenrui with 500 yuan and each of the deputies with 300 yuan. After learning about this, Hu Wenrui called the deputies together to discuss, and everyone agreed not to take this money. When Hu Wenrui announced on behalf of the directors that part of this money would be awarded to the kindergarten and part would be sent to the widows of two deceased labor models, the entire venue applauded for two to three minutes, and some leaders on the stage and representatives below the stage shed tears of emotion.

The enterprise code of "the factory prospers, I am honored; the factory declines, I am ashamed; people and the factory coexist" has taken root in the hearts of every worker, family member, and even the children. Whenever the production is tight, the children in the kindergarten sing: "The oil production is tight, everyone contributes..." Once, a pipeline needed to be relaid. The night before, at 11 o'clock, the mobilization and deployment were completed. The next morning, 3,500 people rushed up ("clang" sound) (at that time, the entire factory had fewer than 5,000 people, and that day was also a Sunday, voluntary labor). Some workers just got off the night shift and did not rest, and climbed onto the car again. The drivers and cooks who sent meals also wielded shovels and worked up a sweat.

Illuminating the Bright Spots in People

Cultivating a collectivist spirit is not to erase a person's individuality or bury a person's value. Hu Wenrui respects the workers, excavates their potential, and combines the realization of personal value with the realization of enterprise value.

Hu Wenrui believes: Even the most backward person has bright spots. Leaders should be good at discovering and illuminating these bright spots, making them see their own brilliance and arousing their sense of self-respect.

The Second Oil Production Plant has a talent registration form, which records the names and specialties of 316 workers, including calligraphy, chess, painting, blowing, plucking, singing, ball games, photography... The Second Oil Production Plant has successively established 13 amateur cultural organizations, including the Calligraphy and Painting Association, Poetry Society, Photography Salon, Philately Association, etc., and established a performing arts troupe, wind orchestra, various chess teams, and basketball teams. In the past two years, more than 40 exhibitions, lectures, recitations, and performances have been held, and more than 200 works have been published in provincial and national publications, with more than 10 people receiving provincial and ministerial-level awards.

Drilling worker Zhao Yuyuan has a famous seal carving skill, known as "Zhao Yiyao." In late 1986, the newly completed underground palace gate of the Second Oil Production Plant needed a plaque. Some said to invite the leader to write, and some said to invite a famous person to write. Hu Wenrui said: "Just ask Xiao Zhao to do it!" Xiao Zhao's heart trembled. Later, Hu Wenrui also

　　人与企业——价值共振
    ——记胡文瑞的思想政治工作
　　庞志学　戴娜
    长庆油田采油二厂原厂长（最近被任命为长庆石油局副局长）胡文瑞，积极探索新时期的思想政治工作，对职工既尊重爱护，又严格要求，引导职工在实现企业价值过程中实现自我价值。职工称胡文瑞是采油二厂的“一把火”。
    追求1＋1＞2
    胡文瑞不否定个别奖励的功效，但他主要是以改变人的思想为核心，追求人与人组合的最佳效益，追求1＋1＞2的整体功效和尽可能大的合力。
    胡文瑞提出了“培植团队精神”的倡议，其核心即集体主义，以“小我”服从“大我”，必要时牺牲“小我”，完成“大我”。
    为培养大家的集体主义意识，胡文瑞主持设计了厂徽，佩带在每个人的胸前，与全厂职工一起制订全厂的治厂方针、企业座右铭和企业信条。用这些规范协调着大家的行为。
    建设企业文化环境
    针对采油二厂地处偏远荒凉山区和新时期职工的文化需要，胡文瑞在1985年就提出了建设企业文化环境的主张。
    采油二厂逐步改变了过去那种上班干活，下班吃饭、睡觉的单调生活模式，开展丰富多采的业余文化生活。每当夜幕低垂的时候，采油二厂的文化中心灯火通明，图书馆、电视室、游艺厅都挤满了职工，书画馆、谈心室都有欢声笑语传来。
      胡文瑞把住房、食堂、一些文化阵地称为“金三角”。他说：“这个三角地带很重要，工人8小时之外的大部分活动时间是在这个三角里。”他认真抓好住房、食堂及一些文化环境建设。就是对厕所也进行治理。采油二厂有公厕70多个，他大都去过。上任5年，每年他都要带领全厂开展7日整治厕所活动。到下面单位检查工作，他常出其不意地到厕所去检查。他说：厕所从一个方面反映了一个单位的文明程度，领导管不好厕所同样是失职。
    塑造公众形象
    胡文瑞提出了“塑造公众形象”的观点。他强调，这对领导尤为重要。这种有形而无声的引导比作多少篇空洞的大报告都起作用。
      该厂原党委书记韩志远，身患腰脊疼痛症，发病时连喘气都痛，还经常奔波在羊肠小道上，与一线工人打成一片。继任的党委书记陈锦华，1988年11月查明身患癌症，当组织决定他去西安治疗时，他领着爱人来到办公室，一件件交待，哪件是公家的物品，要妥善保管……他爱人含着泪水一件件记着。
    在今年元月召开的职工代表大会上，代表们提出要对胡文瑞及其几位副手给予奖励，经讨论决定奖给胡文瑞500元，几位副手每人300元。胡文瑞得知后将几位副手叫到一起商量，大家一致同意不要这笔钱。当胡文瑞代表厂长们宣布将这笔钱一部分奖给托儿所，一部分送给两位去世的劳模遗孀时，全场掌声长达两三分钟，台上的领导和台下的代表中有的流出了热泪。
      “厂兴我荣，厂衰我耻，人与厂共存”的企业信条扎根于每个职工、家属甚至于娃娃的心田。每当产量吃紧，托儿所的小娃娃就唱出：“原油产量紧呀，人人做贡献呀……”一次，一条管线需要重新铺设，头天晚上11点钟动员布置完，第二天早晨“哗啦”一下子上去3500多人（当时全厂不足5000人，当天又是星期日，义务劳动）。有的职工刚下零点班顾不上休息，又爬上了汽车，送饭的司机和炊事员也挥锹干得汗水淋淋。
      拨亮人身上的闪光点
      培育集体主义精神不是要抹煞人的个性，埋没人的价值。胡文瑞尊重职工，发掘职工的潜能，把实现个人价值与实现企业价值结合起来。
      胡文瑞认为：再落后的人身上也有闪光点，领导者就是要善于发现和拨亮其闪光点，使其看到自身的光辉，唤起自尊自重之心。
      采油二厂有一张人才登记表，那上面记着316名职工的名字和他们的特长，琴棋书画，吹拉弹唱，打球照相……采油二厂相继成立了书画协会、诗社、摄影沙龙、集邮协会等13个业余文化组织，成立了文艺演出队、管弦乐队、各种棋类队及篮球队等。两年来先后举办各类展览、演讲、朗诵、文艺演出等40多场，在省内外刊物发表作品200余幅（篇），有10多人次获省部级奖励。
      修井工赵玉元有一手篆刻手艺，是有名的“赵一刀”。1986年底，采油二厂新落成的地宫门要挂块匾。有人说要请领导题词，有人说要请名人献墨，胡文瑞却说：“就请小赵来！”小赵的心颤动了。后来，胡文瑞又把他调到厂文化中心，刻字绘画的活全包在他身上。一些亲友劝他辞职到社会上去赚钱，小赵一口回绝说：“我不能离开二厂。”
    采油二厂在全厂组织了4个既互相联系，又相互区别的司政层次，即参谋层、决策层、管理层、执行层。成立了企业管理研究会、科委会、经管会、思想政治工作研究会等不同形式的智囊机构，把各方面的人才请到议事席上。1989年以来，采油二厂共形成有关决策223项，决策前都先经过群众讨论，然后再经过有关智囊机构专题论证。
    他们还设有“民主监督专用电话”、“举报箱”、“来访接待室”等，职工们反映：在二厂工作，劲有处使，话有处说。
    道是无情却有情
    胡文瑞尊重职工，但不是不加分析地盲目顺从、迁就，而是善于发现其长，发扬其长的同时又注意发现其短，补其短。
      没有规矩不成方圆。胡文瑞从严治厂，从严要求，认真执行规章制度。过去采油二厂的制度虽说不少，但没有严格执行，制度对人没有真正形成规范约束，制度的执行与否没有和人的思想、行为形成一种必然的内在联系。
      现在，采油二厂职工的整体文化素质变了：有大专程度的增加5倍，中专程度和5级以上水平的增加得更多。不仅被“文革”耽误的一代不混了，一些老工人也奋力向上。油气集输大队工人毛应京，曾蒙冤蹲狱，平反时46岁，心灰意冷。全厂的学习热潮使他的心也热了起来，不耻下问，先后在三四个岗位工作都很出色，连续7年被评为先进生产者。46岁开始学徒，54岁成才了，被聘为技术员。
