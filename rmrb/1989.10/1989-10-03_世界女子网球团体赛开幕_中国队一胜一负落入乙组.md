    中国队一胜一负落入乙组
    本报东京10月2日电　记者于青报道：由国际网球联盟主办的1989年世界女子网球团体赛，昨天上午开始在东京有明网球森林公园举行。来自40个国家的140多名选手，将角逐代表一个国家或地区女子网球团体水平的联合会杯。
    中国队4名女选手参加了比赛。昨天在预赛中以2∶1战胜卢森堡队，进入正式比赛行列。今天在第一轮角逐中与实力较强的澳大利亚队比赛，中国队以0∶3失利。未能进入第二轮比赛的各队，将参加乙组比赛。
    世界女子网球名星格拉芙、纳芙拉蒂诺娃等世界女子网球排位前5名的高手均在此次比赛中亮相，是一次水平较高的比赛。由于是整体实力之间的竞争，一花独放难成气候。上届冠军是阵容整齐的捷克斯洛伐克队。
