African nations' representatives issued a statement on October 23 at the United Nations, urging the UN Transition Assistance Group to speed up the implementation of Namibia's independence plan.

The statement said that the election scheduled for November 7 in Namibia is approaching, but the UN Transition Assistance Group has not completed the expected tasks before the election.

The statement warned that South Africa has yet to comply with the UN's Resolution 435 regarding Namibia's independence, and the UN-supervised election in Namibia might be disrupted.

The statement also criticized a UN report issued earlier this month, stating that it showed no efforts made by the UN to force South African police to withdraw from Namibia. The UN report indicated that about 1,000 South African police officers had not yet withdrawn.

African nations' representatives also expressed different opinions on several other issues, including the establishment of Namibia's defense department, the military command structure of the South West Africa Territory Force, and the schedule and procedures for Namibia's election.

    非洲国家代表发表声明
　　要求加快实施纳独立计划
    新华社联合国电　非洲国家代表10月23日在联合国发表一项声明，要求联合国过渡时期援助团加快实施纳米比亚的独立计划。
    声明说，定于11月7日举行的纳米比亚大选业已临近，但联合国过渡时期援助团并没有在大选前完成预期的任务。
    声明警告说，南非至今不遵守关于纳米比亚独立的联合国435号决议，联合国监督举行的纳米比亚大选可能会受到破坏。
    该声明还批评联合国本月早些时候的一份报告，认为从中看不出联合国在迫使南非警察撤出纳米比亚所做的任何努力。联合国的报告表明仍有1000名南非警察尚未撤走。
    非洲国家代表还在其他一些问题上提出了不同意见，其中包括纳米比亚建立国防部、西南非领土部队军事指挥机构、纳米比亚大选日程和程序等问题。
