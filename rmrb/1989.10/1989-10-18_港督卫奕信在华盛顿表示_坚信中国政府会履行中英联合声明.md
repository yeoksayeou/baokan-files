Governor Wilson Says He Believes the Chinese Government Will Honor the Sino-British Joint Declaration

New China News Agency, Washington, October 16 (Reporter He Dalong) Governor Wilson of Hong Kong, who is currently visiting the United States, said today that China has always adhered to international agreements. He expressed his firm belief that the Chinese government will honor the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

Wilson made these remarks during a luncheon speech at the National Press Club in Washington today.

Wilson pointed out in his speech, “China has an excellent reputation for honoring international agreements. I believe this reputation is no less than that of any other country.”

He said that any suggestion for Britain to unilaterally abandon the Sino-British agreement is unreasonable. He also mentioned that after China's economic reforms and opening up, “the economic development of Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta region has taken off and will continue without interruption.”

Before the luncheon, Governor Wilson met with U.S. Secretary of State Baker and exchanged views on China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, Hong Kong's long-term stability, and the issue of Hong Kong refugees.

    港督卫奕信在华盛顿表示
    坚信中国政府会履行中英联合声明
    新华社华盛顿10月16日电（记者何大隆）正在美国访问的香港总督卫奕信今天说，中国始终恪守国际协议。他表示坚信中国政府会履行中英联合声明。
    卫奕信是今天中午在华盛顿全国新闻俱乐部午餐会上发表演讲时讲这番话的。
    卫奕信在讲话时指出，“中国在履行国际协议方面拥有极好的声誉。我认为这种声誉不亚于其他任何国家。”
    他说，任何要求英国单方面放弃中英协议的建议都是毫无道理的。他还说，中国进行经济改革和对外开放后，“香港与华南地区的经济发展已起飞”。并“将不停顿地继续下去”。
    在午餐会前，卫奕信总督会见了美国国务卿贝克，就中国1997年收回香港、香港的长期稳定以及香港难民等问题交换了意见。
