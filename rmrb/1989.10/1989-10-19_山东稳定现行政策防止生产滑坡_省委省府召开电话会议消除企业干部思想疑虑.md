People's Daily, Jinan, October 18th - "We must both prevent economic overheating and avoid a production slump, and do everything possible to complete and exceed this year's industrial and commercial production targets." This was the directive given by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government at a teleconference held today, outlining specific measures to achieve these goals. They emphasized the need to stabilize current policies, do more work, and dispel the doubts of enterprise cadres.

From January to September this year, Shandong Province achieved a total industrial output value of 74.5 billion yuan, a 16.2% increase over the same period last year, surpassing the national average growth rate of 8.9%. The growth rates of industrial output value, sales revenue, profits and taxes, and fiscal revenue of state-owned enterprises within the budget in the entire province all exceeded the national average, with some ranking first in the country. However, industrial and commercial production currently faces new situations and problems. The growth rate of industrial production in the province dropped from 13.1% in August to 6.5% in September, and the decline in economic benefits was even more pronounced. The realized profits and taxes of budgetary industrial enterprises grew by 18.4% in the first half of the year, but saw negative growth in September. Many enterprise cadres are experiencing fluctuations in their thoughts, harboring doubts and concerns about the factory director responsibility system, the contract responsibility system, and specific operational policies.

In response to these issues, Provincial Party Secretary Jiang Chunyun, in his speech, urged all localities to maintain the stability and continuity of policies and quickly reverse the downward trend in industrial and commercial production performance. He emphasized that all reform measures that are conducive to rectification and adjustment, economic stability, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of workers must be continued and improved in their implementation. This mainly includes: contract agreements must be strictly honored, and the income of contractors during the contract period should not be arbitrarily changed. The personal income of managers should be linked to both the economic performance of the enterprise and the income of the workers; the factory director responsibility system should continue to be upheld, and the enterprise party organization should support the factory director in independently handling operational management, production command, and technological development issues. The factory director should also respect and maintain the political core position of the enterprise party organization and voluntarily accept the supervision of the party organization; economic issues related to enterprises should be handled with caution, distinguishing different situations. If past actions were in accordance with relevant regulations of various levels of party committees and governments, and if they are inconsistent with current regulations, they should not be treated as enterprise problems for investigation and handling. If certain issues arise in the specific implementation by enterprises, they can be summarized as experience and lessons, and mistakes caused by policy defects should not be blamed on individual managers; the responsibility system for procurement and sales personnel within the enterprise should continue to be implemented, and the proportion of quotas that are unreasonable can be adjusted accordingly; necessary receptions and entertainments in the normal business interactions of enterprises should be strictly controlled in terms of standards.

    山东稳定现行政策防止生产滑坡
    省委省府召开电话会议消除企业干部思想疑虑
    本报济南10月18日电　记者贾建舟报道：“既要消除经济过热，又要防止生产滑坡，千方百计完成和超额完成今年工交生产的各项任务。”山东省委、省政府在今天召开的电话会议上，对如何实现上述目标作了具体部署，强调要稳定现行政策，多做工作，消除企业干部的思想疑虑。
    今年1至9月份，山东省完成工业总产值745亿元，比去年同期增长16.2％，高于全国8.9％的平均增长幅度。全省预算内国营工业企业产值、销售收入、利税、财政收入的增长幅度，均高于全国平均水平，有的居全国前列。但是，当前工交生产也出现了一些新情况、新问题。9月份全省工业生产增长幅度由8月份的13.1％滑为6.5％，经济效益下滑幅度更大。预算内工业企业实现利税，上半年增长18.4％，而9月份出现负增长。不少企业干部思想波动，对厂长负责制、承包制和具体经营政策等存在一些疑虑和担心。
    针对上述情况，省委书记姜春云在讲话中要求各地务必保持政策的稳定性和连续性，尽快扭转工交生产效益滑坡的局面。他强调指出，凡是有利于治理整顿、有利于稳定经济、有利于调动职工积极性的改革措施，都要继续实行，并在实行中不断完善。这主要包括：承包合同要切实兑现，在承包期内承包者按承包合同应得的收入不要随意改变，经营者的个人收入要与企业经济效益和职工收入双挂钩；厂长责任制要继续坚持，企业党组织要支持厂长独立负责地处理经营管理、生产指挥和技术开发中的问题，厂长也要尊重和维护企业党组织的政治核心地位，自觉接受党组织的监督；对企业经济往来的一些问题要区别不同情况慎重处理，凡是过去按照各级党委和政府有关规定办的，如与现行规定不一致，不要作为企业的问题检查处理，企业在具体执行中若出现某些问题，可总结经验教训，不能把因政策缺陷造成的某些失误归咎于经营者个人；企业内部对供销人员实行的联购联销责任制要继续实行，其定额比例不合理的可适当调整；企业正常交往中必要的应酬接待，要严格掌握标准。
