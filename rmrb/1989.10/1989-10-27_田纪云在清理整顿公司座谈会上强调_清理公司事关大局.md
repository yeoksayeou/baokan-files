Tian Jiyun, at the national conference on cleaning up and rectifying companies, emphasized that cleaning up companies is a matter of great importance.

	▲ Top leaders must take personal charge and not go through the motions.
	▲ The focus of merging and dissolving companies is on dissolving, not merging, to prevent the appearance of dissolution without actual dissolution.
	▲ Properly handle the aftermath of dissolved and merged companies, and do not disband them hastily.
	▲ Concentrate efforts on investigating a number of major cases, and do not use fines instead of criminal penalties or disciplinary actions instead of criminal penalties.

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th: Reporter Pi Shuyi reports: Cleaning up and rectifying companies is not only related to the healthy development of socialist planned commodity economy but also to the prestige of the Party and the government, to whether the rectification and adjustment can be successful, and to whether the comprehensive deepening of reforms can proceed smoothly. This is a matter of fundamental national interest. Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the National Leading Group for Cleaning Up and Rectifying Companies, Tian Jiyun, said in his speech at the national conference on cleaning up and rectifying companies today that various regions and departments should serve this fundamental national interest, with top leaders taking personal charge and ensuring that the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies achieves real results.

	Tian Jiyun said that over the past year, the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies has achieved initial results: some companies have been dissolved and merged, a number of illegal and disciplinary cases have been investigated, and the problem of party and government officials holding positions in companies while in office or after retirement has been basically resolved, as well as the problem of some companies not separating politics from business. However, looking at the national situation, the development is uneven. Many regions and departments lack the resolve and firm attitude to dissolve and merge a batch of companies and investigate major cases; some are hesitant and slow to act; some have a sense of difficulty; some lack leadership, and the top leaders have not taken personal charge.

	Tian Jiyun pointed out that the fundamental reason for these problems is the fear of local, departmental, or unit interests being affected. He said that cleaning up and rectifying companies, especially dissolving and merging a batch of companies, involves the adjustment of interests, and some aspects may be affected and suffer losses. However, from the overall perspective, these losses are only temporary and partial. For the sake of the overall situation, temporary and partial interests that need to be abandoned should be abandoned, and sacrifices that need to be made should be made. We must not hesitate or waver, and even less should we lose sight of the bigger picture for small gains.

	Tian Jiyun said that the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made up their minds on the issue of cleaning up companies. Central state organs should take the lead and set an example. He especially emphasized that the focus of dissolving and merging companies is on dissolving, not merging. We must prevent the appearance of dissolution without actual dissolution, and even more, we must not engage in deception by using the name of dissolution and merger to retain companies that should be dissolved. Top leaders at all levels should personally oversee and directly participate in the research and approval of company dissolution and merger plans. This time, the cleaning up and rectifying of companies will implement a system of leadership responsibility, first of all, requiring top leaders at all levels to be responsible for the dissolution and merger plans.

	The dissolution and merger of companies are policy-intensive, involve a wide range of issues, and are complex. Tian Jiyun requires that we must strictly follow the relevant regulations, with detailed and solid work. The purpose of cleaning up and rectifying companies is to bring order out of chaos. In the past, many companies were established in a hasty manner, and this time, the dissolution and merger of companies should not be done in a hasty manner. Cleaning up and rectifying work should be done seriously and responsibly, ensuring quality, and seeing it through from beginning to end. This time, a relatively large number of companies will be dissolved and merged, involving a considerable number of personnel. In principle, they should be arranged by their respective departments and systems. If there are difficulties in individual arrangements, the personnel and labor departments can provide assistance. It is advocated to arrange the placement in a decentralized manner through multiple channels, multiple levels, and multiple economic components. The dissolution and merger of companies do not mean that all personnel of the companies have problems. They should be treated the same as other cadres and should not be discriminated against. We must do a good job in the clearance of debts and assets to ensure that state assets are not or minimally affected. All contracts signed with external parties must continue to be executed.

	Tian Jiyun said that investigating illegal and disciplinary cases of companies is a matter of great concern to the people. We must make a big decision and concentrate our efforts to break through a number of influential cases. Some units and companies with serious problems cannot open up the situation by self-inspection alone and must be investigated by competent authorities sending capable inspection teams. The handling of illegal and disciplinary problems and cases of companies should not be limited to fines, but must also legally pursue the responsibility of the relevant parties. Those who should be disciplined must be disciplined, and those who should be prosecuted must be prosecuted. We must not use fines instead of criminal penalties or disciplinary actions instead of criminal penalties. We must adhere to the mass line and the principle of seeking truth from facts, basing our actions on facts and using laws as the standard, and standing the test of history.

　　田纪云在清理整顿公司座谈会上强调
　　清理公司事关大局
　　▲主要领导亲自抓，不走过场
　　▲撤并公司重点是撤不是并，防止明撤暗不撤
　　▲认真做好被撤并公司善后工作，不能一哄而散
　　▲集中力量查处一批大要案，不能以罚代刑，以纪代刑
    本报北京10月26日讯　记者皮树义报道：清理整顿公司不仅关系到社会主义有计划的商品经济的健康发展，而且关系到党和政府的威信，关系到治理整顿能否取得成功，关系到全面深化改革能否顺利进行，这是党和国家的根本利益所在。国务院副总理、全国清理整顿公司领导小组组长田纪云今天在全国清理整顿公司工作座谈会的讲话中，要求各地区、各部门服从这一事关全局的根本利益，主要领导亲自动手，把清理整顿公司工作抓出实效来。
    田纪云说，清理整顿公司工作进行一年来，取得了初步成效：撤并了一些公司，查处了一批违法违纪案件，基本解决了党政机关在职和离退休干部在公司兼、任职务的问题和一部分公司政企不分的问题。但是，从全国的情况看，发展还不平衡。不少地区和部门对撤并一批公司和查处大案要案决心不大，态度不坚决，有的犹豫观望，行动迟缓；有的有畏难情绪；有的领导不力，主要领导没有亲自动手抓。
    田纪云指出，产生这些问题的根本原因是害怕本地区、本部门、本单位的利益受到损失。他说，清理整顿公司，特别是撤并一批公司，涉及到利益关系的调整，有些方面的利益可能受到一些影响和损失，但从全局来看，这些损失毕竟只是暂时的、局部的。为了大局，局部的、暂时的利益，该放弃的要放弃，该牺牲的要牺牲，绝不能犹豫动摇，更不能因小失大。
    田纪云说，在清理公司问题上，党中央、国务院是下了决心的。中央国家机关要带头，作出表率。他特别强调，公司撤并的重点是撤而不是并，一定要防止明撤暗不撤，更不得弄虚作假，利用撤并的名义保留那些本该撤销的公司。各级主要领导同志要亲自过问、直接参与公司撤并方案的研究和审定。这次清理整顿公司实行领导负责制，首先就是要求各级主要领导同志对撤并方案负责。
    撤并公司政策性强，涉及面广，情况复杂，田纪云要求一定要严格按照有关规定进行，工作要细，要扎实。清理整顿公司目的是为了治乱。过去不少公司成立时一哄而上，这次撤并公司不能一哄而散。清理整顿工作要认真负责，保证质量，做到善始善终。这次撤并的公司比较多，涉及的人员数量相当大，原则上由各部门、各系统自行安排，个别安排确有困难的，人事、劳动部门可予以帮助。提倡多渠道、多层次、多种经济成份分散安置。公司被撤并并不等于公司的人员都有问题。对他们与其它干部要一视同仁，不得歧视。要做好债权债务和资产的清理工作，确保国家财产不受或少受损失。凡对外签约的合同，一定要继续执行。
    田纪云说，查处公司的违法违纪案件是人民群众最为关心的一个问题。必须下大决心，集中力量突破一批有影响的案件。一些问题严重的单位和公司单靠自查，难以打开局面，必须由上级领导部门派出得力检查组进行查处。处理公司的违法违纪问题和案件不能光罚款了事，还必须依法追究当事人有关人的责任，该给纪律处分的要给纪律处分，该起诉的要起诉，绝不能以罚代刑，以纪代刑。要坚持群众路线和实事求是原则，做到以事实为依据，以法律为准绳，经得起历史考验。
