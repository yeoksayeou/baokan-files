Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th.

From July to September, the Ministry of Personnel organized 540 experts who have made outstanding contributions to various scenic areas for rest and vacation.

In early June, after the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, all administrative personnel in state organs had their vacations canceled. However, the State Council cared for experts who have made outstanding contributions in various fields and decided to give them special treatment, arranging for them to rest and vacation. The Ministry of Personnel organized 10 groups of experts to go to scenic spots such as Dalian, Huangshan, Lushan, and Wuyishan.

Some experts also used the opportunity to gather and engage in academic exchanges during their vacations. Some experts were also consulted on issues such as urban construction, environmental protection, and industrial layout in the local area.

    五百多名贡献突出专家破例享受休养度假待遇
    新华社北京10月5日电（记者刘思扬、姜在忠）人事部自7月初至9月底，先后组织了540名有突出贡献的专家到一些风景区休养度假。
    今年6月初，北京发生反革命暴乱后，国家机关行政人员一律取消了休假，但国务院关心在各行各业有突出贡献的专家，决定特殊对待，安排他们休养度假。人事部为此先后组织10批专家分别到大连、黄山、庐山、武夷山等风光名胜地休假。
    一些专家还利用休假相聚的机会进行了学术交流，有的专家还就当地的城市建设、环保、工业布局等问题接受了咨询。
