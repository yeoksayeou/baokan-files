From the new Shanghai Railway Station, one can see from afar the red leaves specially decorated on the high building of the Yangzi Timber Factory. They are so vibrant. The "Maple Leaf" brand products produced by this key enterprise of the State Forestry Administration are indeed as famous as their name suggests in the market.

In 1982, their flagship product, plastic veneer panels, won the national silver award. However, since then, they have felt a sense of crisis. The market is ever-changing, and the 1,500 employees of the factory cannot rely on a single product. Take this plastic veneer panel used for sewing machine tables, for example. When sewing machines were popular, it also became popular. When sewing machines declined in popularity, the demand for it naturally decreased. If no measures were taken, the future of Yangzi Factory would not be promising.

The awareness to open up new markets emerged from this sense of crisis. On one hand, they maintained their flagship products and held onto the existing market, while on the other hand, they focused on developing new products and actively exploring new markets. Over the past few years, Yangzi Factory has been moving forward in this way. Take, for example, the low-flame soft-light plastic veneer panel that won the national second-class science and technology progress award. During a meeting of the State Forestry Administration, General Manager Wang Baokang heard information about new international regulations for fire prevention in ocean-going ships. He immediately returned to Shanghai, quickly determined the project, and organized one-third of the factory's technical staff to work on it. Starting from a sample of a foreign product, after numerous experiments, they finally succeeded in filling a domestic gap. Its main technical indicators surpassed international counterparts, and orders poured in.

They predicted that with the rise of the computer boom, materials used to decorate computer rooms would become popular. Seizing the opportunity, they quickly developed the product. Soon, anti-static plastic veneer panels and movable floors for computer rooms were produced in batches. They were the only ones in the country to do so.

The various series of "Maple Leaf" brand products continuously opened up new markets. Yangzi Factory almost rearranged its product display room every year.

From 1985 to 1987, Yangzi Factory's new product development was like an unstoppable spring. In three years, they won 12 awards, including the national second-class science and technology award, the Shanghai Municipal excellent new product first-class award, and the State Forestry Administration major science and technology achievement award. Economic benefits significantly improved, and the export earning rate of products increased. By the end of 1988, because these products had established a foothold in the international market, they earned 4.2 million yuan in foreign exchange in one year, more than double the target set by their superiors of 2.05 million yuan. Yangzi Factory was rated as an outstanding export enterprise.

Thus, "Maple Leaf" became famous.

    “枫叶”怎样红起来
    吴芝麟
    从上海火车新客站出来，远远可以看到扬子木材厂高楼上那片特意装饰的红叶，它是那么鲜艳。这家林业部的骨干企业生产的“枫叶”牌产品，正像它的名字那样，在市场上红着哩。
    1982年，他们的拳头产品——塑料贴面板就获得国家银质奖。然而从那时起，他们就产生了危机感。市场千变万化，全厂1500名职工，不能在一棵树上吊死。就说这种用做缝纫机台板的塑料贴面板吧，缝纫机走俏时，它也随着走红。缝纫机由俏转滞，对它的需求自然减少。如不采取对策，扬子厂的前景可不妙。
    开拓意识从危机感中产生。一手抓名牌产品，守住已有市场，一手抓新产品开发，积极开拓新市场。这几年，扬子厂就是这样走过来的。就说那个获国家科技进步二等奖的低播焰柔光塑料贴面板吧。厂长王宝康在参加林业部的一次会议时，听到国际海船建造防火有新规定的信息后，马上赶回上海，迅速确定项目，组织了厂技术科1／3力量攻关。他们从一张国外产品的样板着手，经过许多次试验，终于成功地填补了国内空白。其主要技术指标超过了国际同类产品，订单一张张飞来。
    他们预测到这样的信息：随着计算机热的兴起，装饰计算机房用的材料必将走俏。他们抓住时机，尽快研制。时隔不久，为计算机房所用的抗静电塑料贴面板和活动地板就批量生产了。全国独此一家。
    “枫叶”牌的各式系列样品，不断地开拓着新的市场。扬子厂几乎每年都要重新布置一下那间产品陈列室。
    从1985到1987三年间，扬子厂新产品的开发如关不住的春色，3年捧回了12项奖。其中有国家科技二等奖、上海市优质新产品一等奖、林业部重大科技成果奖。经济效益明显提高，产品的出口创汇率递增。1988年底，因为这些产品在国际市场上站住了脚，一年就创汇420万元，比上级要求的205万元指标高一倍多。扬子厂被评为出口优秀企业。
    “枫叶”就这样红了起来。
