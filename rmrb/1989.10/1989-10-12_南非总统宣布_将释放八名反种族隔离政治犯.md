Xinhua News Agency, Harare, October 11th. Reporter Li Jingwei reports: According to news from Pretoria, South African President De Klerk announced last night that "once the necessary procedures are completed," eight anti-apartheid political prisoners will be unconditionally released.

Among the eight political prisoners to be released is Sisulu, who has been imprisoned for 26 years. It is said that he is a close friend of Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress.

De Klerk said that the matter of releasing political prisoners has been discussed with Mandela. However, he mentioned that the issue of releasing Mandela has not yet been put on the agenda.

In a statement, De Klerk said that the decision to release political prisoners was made in the current favorable climate. He also acknowledged that this decision was made in the context of long-term demands and protests from various quarters.

According to another report, before announcing this decision, De Klerk called British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to inform her of the situation. The British government welcomed the decision by the South African authorities. Mrs. Thatcher described De Klerk's decision as "a significant step in the right direction."

Mrs. Thatcher hopes that this move will pave the way for negotiations on the establishment of a new constitution for South Africa.

    南非总统宣布
    将释放八名反种族隔离政治犯
    本报哈拉雷10月11日电　记者李景卫报道：据比勒陀利亚消息，南非总统德克勒克昨晚宣布，“必要的手续”一履行就无条件地释放8名反种族隔离的政治犯。
    这8名将被释放的政治犯中包括已被关押26年的西苏鲁。据说他是南非非洲人国民大会领导人曼德拉的密友。
    德克勒克说，有关释放政治犯的事宜同曼德拉进行过讨论。但他提到释放曼德拉的事目前还没有提上议事日程。
    德克勒克在一份声明中称，释放政治犯的决定是在目前存在的有利气候下作出的。他同时承认这种决定也是在来自各方的长期要求和抗议的背景下作出的。
    另据报道，德克勒克在宣布这项决定之前给英国首相撒切尔夫人通了电话，向她通报这一情况。英国政府对南非当局的决定表示欢迎。撒切尔夫人称德克勒克的决定是“朝正确方向迈出的较大一步”。
    撒切尔夫人希望此举能为有关建立南非新宪法的谈判开辟道路。
