The people who deliver exam papers—this specifically refers to those who transport exam papers during the college entrance examinations.

Statistics show that in Sichuan alone, every year during the college entrance examination period, thousands of people work day and night to transport exam papers along thousands of miles of routes.

Before the exam on July 7, they must do their utmost to deliver the exam papers to every exam venue. After the exam ends on July 9, they immediately set out to send the answer sheets to the places where they will be graded. No matter how treacherous the journey or how great the difficulties, they must ensure that the exam papers are delivered quickly, on time, and without any damage.

Year after year, they toil tirelessly, silently dedicating themselves to being the stepping stones for one batch of examinees after another, passing on hope.

Before and after the 1989 college entrance examinations, floods and torrential rains swept through many parts of Sichuan.

Floodwaters surged, roads were cut off, and bridges were destroyed. The roads in Sichuan were already difficult to travel, and with the added misfortune of natural disasters, the transportation of exam papers faced enormous challenges.

The college entrance examinations were imminent, and the exam papers needed to be sent from Kangding, the capital of Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, to various counties throughout the prefecture.

However, the mountain torrents had cut off almost all the roads from Kangding to the various counties. The north and south convoys that had set out from Kangding on July 3 were all blocked along the way.

The situation was particularly severe on the southern route.

From Kangding to Decheng County, one had to cross the Yalong River and traverse five major mountains, including Zheduo and Hailong. The journey was fraught with danger. Just the 100-kilometer stretch from Kangding to Yajiang had more than 20 mudslides.

Ma Yonghua and his companions had been stranded on this stretch for three days and two nights, sharing their meager rations. Despite the hunger and fatigue, no one left the exam papers unattended for a moment.

But as another night fell, Ma Yonghua could no longer remain calm: We can die here if we must, but so many people are eagerly waiting for these exam papers!

In the darkness, they tried several times to dig through the mud to let the exam transport vehicle pass, but they failed. Finally, they had no choice but to unload the exam papers from the vehicle, pack them into sacks, and carry the sacks, each weighing over a hundred pounds, through the mud, avoiding the falling rocks overhead, and groping their way through the mudslide section in the dark. Then, they returned to slowly guide the empty vehicle through.

In this way, they alternated between driving and carrying the exam papers, rushing to deliver them to Baoxing County, which was still over 100 kilometers away from Decheng County. By then, everyone was completely exhausted. They had set out at 3 AM on July 3, and it was now past midnight on July 5, three days and nights had passed, but the exam papers were still on the way.

Fortunately, comrades from Decheng had rushed to meet them in the middle of the night. Time was of the essence, and the next section of the road showed signs of another large-scale mudslide, so they did not dare to rest for a moment. They quickly completed the handover procedures and immediately set out, continuing to deliver the exam papers to Decheng.

The exam papers arrived in Decheng around noon on July 6. These "relay runners" who had carried the exam papers over more than 100 kilometers of treacherous roads had collapsed from exhaustion. When a female teacher who knew the situation distributed the exam papers to the examinees, she only said, "These exam papers came at a great cost..." and could say no more, tears streaming down her face.

She thought, These examinees are more concerned about their scores and whether they will be admitted, and perhaps they will never know the origin of these exam papers or the names of those who delivered them!

In fact, the names of the people who deliver exam papers are closely tied to the exam papers themselves.

Among them, there is a saying: "As long as I am here, the exam papers are here." Like the soldiers' oath during the revolutionary war years, "As long as I am here, the position is secure," it is firm, confident, and filled with a strong sense of responsibility and dedication.

Sometimes, to ensure the absolute safety of the exam papers, the people who deliver them often disregard their own lives. How would you evaluate them with today's values?

On the morning of July 10, after the college entrance examinations ended, Xiang Bengui and two others escorted the answer sheets of the examinees from Nanjiang County to the regional leadership's office in Dazhou for consolidation.

When the car reached the head of the Chaoyang Bridge, they saw that the floodwaters had risen over a foot high on the bridge deck. Countless cars were stranded on both ends of the bridge, and no one dared to risk crossing.

Xiang Bengui and the others waited until the afternoon, but the floodwaters showed no signs of receding. It was already late, and there was no other way. If they waited any longer, they would definitely delay the time for the answer sheets to be transported from Dazhou to Chengdu.

At this moment, crossing the river was dangerous. But the three comrades decided: We will take the risk and cross the river.

In a vast expanse of water, the bridge deck was invisible. Xiang Bengui and another comrade stood in the surging floodwaters, step by step, guiding the exam transport vehicle.

Unexpectedly, the car suddenly stalled in the middle of the river. Xiang Bengui and the others, disregarding their own safety, released the brake, bent down, and used their shoulders to push the car forward. The floodwaters rose rapidly, and it was difficult for people to stand upright. If they did not hurry, the floodwaters would surge into the car, and thousands of answer sheets might be ruined. Facing this situation, they tenaciously used their bodies to block the floodwaters and moved the car wheels with all their might. After more than half an hour of struggle, they managed to push the car through the raging floodwaters and across the bridge.

Some people say, delivering exam papers is tough, but they are born to do this job and eat this kind of food! This is a great misunderstanding.

This year, among the four people who delivered exam papers from Wanzhou to Chengdu, besides Xu Daizhuang and Liu Zhiping who were admission office staff, Xiong Shuming was a driver for the regional science association, and Ye Guangquan was a public security soldier.

Year after year, the people who deliver exam papers are like this, temporarily assembled.

As Ye Guangquan said: "To endure this hardship is purely a sense of duty, to do something I consider very sacred."

Xu Daizhuang, the leader of the Wanzhou exam paper delivery team, said: "China is poor, and our mountainous areas are even poorer. Nine counties and one city have eight that receive subsidies, and 30% of middle school teachers have not yet reached the relevant standards. Poor areas need more red and expert talents. In recent years, the number of students who have graduated from university and returned to their hometowns to work has increased compared to previous years. We hope to send more children to university, to cultivate more all-around talents and send them back. Poor areas are where they can truly make a difference!"

    勿忘万千送卷人
    新华社记者　杨力　新华社通讯员　何智星
    送卷人——这里特指那些为高考运送试卷的人们。
    据统计，仅仅在四川，每年高考期间，就有数以千计的人，为运送试卷而日夜操劳，奔忙在纵横千里的送卷线上。
    7月7日开考之前，他们要竭尽全力将试卷送到每个考场，7月9日考试结束，他们又立即启程把答卷送往阅卷的地方。无论路途多险困难多大，都必须迅速、准时、确保试卷毫发无损。
    年年高考，岁岁辛劳，送卷人，以其默默的奉献，为一轮又一轮的考生甘当着人梯，传递着希望。
    1989年高考前后，遍布四川许多地区的暴雨洪灾降临了。
    洪水泛滥，路断桥毁。本来蜀道就难行，再加上老天作孽，高考试卷的运送面临着极大的困难。
    高考在即，试卷急需从甘孜藏族自治州首府康定送往全州各县。
    可山洪暴发，使康定通往各县的道路几乎全部中断。7月3日就从康定出发的南北两路运卷车队也统统受阻途中。
    尤其南线一路，情况严重。
    从康定南下到得荣县城，要渡过雅江河，翻越折多、海子等五座大山。一路险象丛生，单是康定至雅江不足100公里路段，就发生20多处泥石流。
    马永华和他的同伴们已在这段路上被困三天两夜了，仅有的干粮大家分着吃，再困再饿也没人离开试卷一步。
    可当又一个夜晚来临时，马永华沉不住气了：我们饿死在此不要紧，可那么多人在眼巴巴等着这考卷呀！
    黑夜中，他们几次试图挖开泥道让运卷车强行通过，都没成功。最后，只好将试卷卸下车来，分装在麻袋里，几个人挽起裤腿，背起百余斤重的麻袋，趟着泥浆，避开头上不时滚下的石块，摸黑走过泥石流段。然后，又返过头来护着空车慢慢通过。
    就这样车运一节人背一段，心急火燎地把试卷送到距离得荣县城还有100多公里的乡城县时，几人全累瘫了。3日凌晨就出发，此时已过7月5日深夜零点，三天三夜过去了，可试卷仍在半路途中。
    幸而从得荣前来接应的同志连夜赶到了。时间紧迫，前面路段又已出现再度发生大规模泥石流的迹象，所以他们片刻也不敢歇息，匆匆办完交接手续便立即出发，将试卷继续送往得荣。
    试卷抵达得荣，已是7月6日临近中午了。这些背着试卷赶了100多公里险路的“接力队员”们，试卷送到，人也全累倒了。
    当一位知情的监考女教师将试卷分发给考生时，只说了声“这试卷来得不易……”便再也说不出声了，泪水滚滚而下。
    她思忖着，这些考生啊，更多关心的是自己的成绩和能否被录取，或许永远也不会知道这份考卷的来历以及那些送卷人的姓名！
    其实，送卷人的姓名本来就是与试卷紧紧联系着的。
    在他们中间爱说这样一句话：“人在试卷在”。就像革命战争年代那句“人在阵地在”的战士誓言一般，坚定、自信、充满着强烈的责任感与献身精神。
    有时，为了试卷的绝对安全，送卷人还常把生死置之度外，在今天，你能用怎样的价值观去评价他们呢？
    还是在今年高考结束后的7月10日早晨，向本贵等一行三人护送着南江县考生的答卷，准备前往地区领导机关所在地达县集中。
    车至朝阳桥桥头，只见洪水漫过桥面足有一尺来高，无数汽车受阻桥的两端，没人敢冒险经过。
    向本贵他们一直等到下午，仍不见洪水有下退之势。天色已晚又别无它途，再等，肯定将延误试卷从达县集中运往成都的时间。
    此刻过江是危险的。但三位同志还是决定：冒险过江。
    一片汪洋，不见桥面，向本贵便与另外一位同志站在滚滚洪水中为运卷车步步探路。
    不料车至江中又突然熄火。向本贵等不顾安危，松开刹车，弓身跨步，用肩膀顶着车轮推车向前。洪水迅猛上涨，人已难以直立，倘若再不抓紧，洪水涌进车内，数千份答卷就可能泡汤。面对此状，他们顽强地用身体挡着洪水，两手拚命搬动车轮，奋战半个多小时，硬是从滔滔洪水中把车“搬”过了大桥。
    有人说，送卷人苦，可他们天生就是干这行，吃这饭的呀！这真是一个莫大的误解。
    今年，从万县送卷到成都的4位同志中，除了徐代壮和刘志平是招办工作人员外，熊树明是地区科协的司机，叶光全则是一名公安战士。
    年年如此，送卷人都是这样临时组合的。
    正如叶光全所说：“肯来苦这一趟，纯粹是尽义务，是干一件我认为非常神圣的事情。”
    万县送卷组组长徐代壮说：“中国穷，我们这山区更穷。9县一市有8个吃补贴，30％的中学教师还未达有关标准，穷地方更急需又红又专的人才。这几年，从大学毕业回乡实干的学生比往年增多了。我们就希望多送些孩子念大学，让大学多培养些品学兼优的人才送回来。贫困地区，正是他们的用武之地啊！”
