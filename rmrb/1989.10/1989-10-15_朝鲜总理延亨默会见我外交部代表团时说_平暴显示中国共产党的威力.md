When discussing Sino-North Korean friendship, Kim Yong Nam said that the two countries had formed a unique relationship through long-term struggle that no other country could compare to. The Party, government, and people of North Korea will spare no effort to inherit and develop the close and interdependent friendship between the two countries for generations to come.

He said that under the joint care of the leaders of North Korea and China, the friendly relations between the two countries have developed very well. The North Korean leadership attaches great importance to the relationship between North Korea and China. The friendly relations forged in the common struggle between the two countries are unbreakable by any force.
