By the end of September, Shenyang City had cleared out over 2,000 companies, centers, and some business units that did not comply with policy regulations and were engaged in illegal operations of key production materials. These units either exceeded their operational scope for resale, increased operational links, or converted planned materials to unplanned sales. After the rectification, the number of enterprises operating steel in Shenyang was reduced from the original 3,000 to 387; the number of enterprises operating state-designated specialized and controlled commodities was also reduced from over 1,000 to more than 200.

    违法经营重要生产资料  沈阳两千余公司被清理
    据新华社沈阳10月18日电　（记者姜敏）截至9月末，沈阳市共清理掉不符合政策规定和违法经营重要生产资料的公司、中心和部分经营单位2000多家，占全市原有生产资料经营单位的1／2。这些单位有的超越经营范围进行倒卖，增加经营环节，有的将计划内生产资料转计划外销售等。经整顿，沈阳市经营钢材的企业由原来的3000户减少到387户；经营国家指定的专营、专控商品的企业也由原来的上千家减少到200多家。
