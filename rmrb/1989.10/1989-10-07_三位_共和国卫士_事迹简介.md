    Brief Introduction to the Deeds of Three "Guardians of the Republic"

    Wang Yuweng, the Selfless Rescuer

    Comrade Wang Yuweng is a laboratory technician in the medical team of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police, from Xidian Village, Dading County, Hebei Province. He enlisted in December 1986 and holds the rank of sergeant. On the early morning of June 4, 1989, while performing the task of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, he bravely rescued injured personnel despite facing the violent attacks of counter-revolutionary rioters, sustaining severe injuries in the process.

    On the early morning of June 4, 1989, Wang Yuweng's medical team was ordered to rescue 164 injured personnel near the Minzu Hotel in Xixingsheng Alley. Facing the test of life and death, he volunteered and insisted on joining the rescue team.

    When the vehicle reached the entrance of the Children's Hospital, it was intercepted by a group of counter-revolutionary rioters and uninformed crowds, preventing the vehicle from moving forward. They were forced to take detours through alleys and small lanes. When they reached the intersection of Baihua Temple Road, a group of rioters armed with sticks and bricks surrounded them, smashing the vehicle's windows and dragging out the driver and the leading doctor, Zhang, to beat them mercilessly. They also locked Wang Yuweng and another medical staff member inside the vehicle, flipped it over, and then dragged Wang out. The vicious rioters swarmed him, shouting, "Beat him to death, beat him to death!" Instantly, Wang Yuweng was struck by bricks and stones, sustaining injuries all over his body and losing consciousness. The inhuman rioters, still not satisfied, tied his legs with ropes and dragged him to a "safety island" about 10 meters away for public display, kicking his head repeatedly, with blood dripping onto the road. Seeing that he was still alive, they savagely placed a 20-kilogram cement block on his chest, beating and humiliating him for several hours. It was not until around 7 AM on June 4 that Wang Yuweng was rescued from the rioters by his comrades. Upon examination, Wang Yuweng sustained severe cranial injuries, extensive brain contusions, skull base fractures, bilateral kidney contusions with renal failure, and 103 contusions and lacerations all over his body, with 30 injuries on his head alone, putting his life in grave danger. After receiving meticulous treatment, he has now turned from critical condition to stable.

    Comrade Wang Yuweng is an outstanding soldier of the People's Armed Police. He loves the People's Armed Police and the medical profession. Since the turmoil in Beijing, Wang Yuweng has been steadfast in supporting the major decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, aligning himself with the Party Central Committee in his thoughts, politics, and actions. During this period, he actively applied to join the Communist Party of China, demonstrating a firm political stance and a lofty communist conviction.

    Wang Zhiqiang, the Brave and Cunning

    Comrade Wang Zhiqiang is the deputy director of the Internal Security Division of the Command Department of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police, from Laizhou City, Shandong Province. He is of Han ethnicity, has a high school education, is a member of the Communist Party, was born in June 1956, enlisted in February 1976, and holds the rank of lieutenant colonel. From mid-April to early June 1989, during the struggle to suppress the turmoil and the counter-revolutionary riot, he stood firm, held high the banner, and fought on the front lines. Especially after the outbreak of the counter-revolutionary riot, when the Party and the state faced difficulties, he stepped forward, bravely shouldered heavy responsibilities, acted wisely and decisively, and fought tenaciously against the counter-revolutionary rioters, completing several missions excellently and fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of a guardian of the republic.

    During the suppression of the turmoil, he often worked through the night, completing tasks assigned by superiors. After the martial law was declared on May 20, he ensured command and liaison work for five days, working continuously for three days and nights without rest, guaranteeing the timely transmission and implementation of instructions and orders. Subsequently, he worked for another three days and nights without rest, drawing charts and drafting plans, providing timely materials and bases for the leaders.

    On the early morning of June 3, in a situation where traffic was blocked, he led a driver to break through the rioters' blockade and siege, delivering the urgent confidential documents to the designated location on time. On the way back, Wang Zhiqiang discovered a group of rioters attacking and beating two officers of the martial law troops and attempting to take them away in a van. He quickly hid the car and bravely went to rescue them, cleverly helping the two officers into the duty station of the Art Museum for protection.

    On the night of June 3 to the early morning of June 4, during the battle to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, he was ordered to organize the anti-riot squad of the People's Armed Police to clear the way for the main force of the martial law troops to enter Tiananmen Square. When the convoy reached the intersection of Yuquan Road and Yongding Road, thousands of rioters and uninformed crowds blocked the intersection. He wisely commanded the driver to first slow down, choose a clear path, and then speed up to forcefully pass through. When they reached the intersection of Wukesong and Wanshou Road, they were attacked by rioters throwing stones and bricks. In this situation, Wang Zhiqiang jumped out of the car, wisely guiding the convoy to quickly pass through before running back to the command car, dodging the stones and bricks thrown at him. Upon reaching the deployment area, he proactively proposed to the "Forward Command" leaders a battle plan where the anti-riot squad would lead the assault from the front, with the PLA protecting the flanks, removing obstacles, and the main force following in vehicles. This plan was approved by the leaders. At this point, the road to Tiananmen Square was heavily blocked by rioters. Over a hundred military vehicles and buses were smashed and burned, pushed to the intersection as obstacles. Traffic isolation pillars and iron fences were laid across the road, and blankets soaked in gasoline were set on fire, with the entire street engulfed in flames. The rioters shouted and attacked the troops with stones, cement bricks, soda bottles, and bags of lime. Facing this situation, Wang Zhiqiang remained calm and decisive, commanding the anti-riot squad to form an assault formation and quickly prepare for the charge. He then shouted, "Comrades, charge!" Leading the anti-riot squad, they bravely charged, using tear gas, electric batons, and stones to fight the rioters to the death. He commanded the anti-riot squad while coordinating with the advance units of the PLA, adjusting the formation, tactics, and pace of the attack according to the situation, making the assaults effective. When the anti-riot squad broke through the siege and repelled the attacks of the rioters in the Fengxingmen area, Wang Zhiqiang immediately suggested to the superiors: "Do not stop, seize the opportunity, accelerate, and charge straight to Tiananmen." After the suggestion was approved, he shouted to the anti-riot squad and the advance units of the PLA, "For victory, advance at full speed!" Immediately launching a fierce attack on the rioters. The comrades fought more bravely, advancing faster and faster, and timely rescued 350 officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison's First Brigade who were surrounded. During the battle, he charged at the front, fighting face-to-face with the rioters, sustaining three injuries to his legs with blood flowing, completely ignoring his own safety. He was hit by large cement bricks thrown from the buildings along the street six times, but he gritted his teeth and did not fall, leading the anti-riot squad to repel the rioters' counterattacks, removing roadblocks and fire barriers, breaking through layer upon layer of blockades. After 2 hours and 45 minutes of fierce fighting, together with the advance units of the PLA, they advanced 30 miles and finally reached Tiananmen Square at 1:45 AM on June 4, completing the mission excellently.

    After arriving at Tiananmen Square, he continued to fight, participating in the battle to clear Tiananmen Square. In the complex situation, according to the tasks and formation of our clearing troops, in order to timely grasp the situation and facilitate unified command, he requested permission from superiors to advance alone, 30 meters ahead of the troops, to command, ensuring the successful completion of the mission.

    Jiang Chaocheng, the Leader Who Leads by Example

    Comrade Jiang Chaocheng is the squad leader of the Eighth Squad of the Fifth Brigade of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police, from Macheng County, Hubei Province. He is of Han ethnicity, was born in August 1962, enlisted in November 1980, and holds the rank of captain. Jiang Chaocheng's squad is a mobile special police unit. During the task of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, he led the anti-riot squad, fearlessly facing violence, bravely shouldering heavy responsibilities, overcoming difficulties, and cooperating with the advance units of the PLA. He excellently completed the arduous tasks of protecting the "Forward Command," implementing a spearhead assault, and forcing the martial law troops to enter Tiananmen Square, making outstanding contributions to suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot and defending the Party Central Committee and the People's Republic of China.

    During the battle to open a path for the anti-riot squad, Jiang Chaocheng commanded decisively and handled situations flexibly. On the night of June 3, after receiving the task of escorting the "Forward Command," he wisely ordered the soldiers in the vehicle to take off their police uniforms and adopt a low-seated posture to hide their advance, ensuring the safe and timely arrival of the troops at the command headquarters. When escorting the "Forward Command" through the intersections of Yuquan Road and Yongding Road, they were intercepted by thousands of people, respectively. He decisively adopted methods such as turning off the lights and then suddenly turning them on, slowing down and then suddenly speeding up to break through two checkpoints. At the Wukesong intersection, they were pursued and intercepted by tens of thousands of people and attacked by rioters throwing stones, bricks, and glass bottles, making it impossible to clear the obstacles, and the troops were obstructed. Jiang Chaocheng led the anti-riot squad members, braving the rain of stones, bricks, and glass bottles, suddenly shouting and charging out of the car, making the rioters panic and the onlookers disperse to the sides. He organized personnel to clear the obstacles while advancing towards the predetermined target, safely escorting the "Forward Command" to the Military Museum at 10:20 PM. Immediately afterwards, Jiang Chaocheng led the squad to accept the task of opening the way for the martial law troops to enter Tiananmen Square. During the battle, facing extremely complex situations, he remained calm and commanded flexibly. At the intersection of Muxidi, five to six thousand people, incited by rioters, threw stones and bricks at the troops, injuring many comrades severely. He commanded the anti-riot squad to adopt an arc formation, protecting each other, and bravely advancing forward. After crossing the bridge, they were attacked by tens of thousands of rioters and uninformed crowds, and the troops were severely obstructed again. Facing this situation, Jiang Chaocheng commanded flexibly, reorganized, and adopted a triangular formation to advance, accelerating the advance and breaking through one barrier after another. Throughout the battle, Jiang Chaocheng commanded the battle while using various opportunities to continuously inspire the troops, proposing slogans such as "One success, no stalemate, unity, no lagging behind," and "Open a bloody path, defend the People's Republic with our lives," greatly boosting the morale of the troops.

    During the battle, Jiang Chaocheng fearlessly faced danger and led by example. At the Wukesong intersection, he was attacked by tens of thousands of people and a group of rioters, and the vehicle was smashed. He bravely rushed out of the car door first, organizing the troops to counterattack. At Muxidi, the rioters identified him as a commander, and the "firepower" was concentrated on him. His left calf was injured by a stone, with blood soaking through his shoes and socks, but he did not stop to bandage himself and continued to command the battle. At the intersection of Nangongshilu, his right thigh and upper body were injured by stones thrown by rioters, but he dragged his two injured legs, enduring the pain all over his body, and continued to command, always at the forefront of the team. At the intersection of Fuxingmen, dozens of burning vehicles blocked the way, and thousands of people attacked from the bridge and under the bridge. He shouted, "Comrades, follow me!" and was the first to charge towards the cars that could explode at any moment, leading the anti-riot squad members to charge through the driver's cab, car roof, and undercarriage. When the troops reached the intersection of Xidan, the road surface was covered with blankets soaked in gasoline and set on fire, creating a wall of fire. He braved the rain of stones, standing in the most conspicuous position—the traffic safety island—to command, and personally led an assault team to charge into the fire, opening the way while fighting back against the rioters. His rubber shoes were burned, and his feet blistered, but he paid no heed. Under his and other leaders' guidance, after more than two hours of continuous struggle and fierce fighting, all anti-riot squad members were injured but successfully guided the PLA martial law troops to reach Tiananmen Square at 1:45 AM on June 4, and smoothly carried out the clearing mission.

    三位“共和国卫士”事迹简介    
    忘我救人的王玉文
    王玉文同志是武警北京总队一支队卫生队化验员，河北省大名县西店乡店北村人，1986年12月入伍，下士警衔。1989年6月4日凌晨，在执行平息首都反革命暴乱任务中，面对反革命暴徒的疯狂袭击，冒着生命危险奋力救护伤员，惨遭暴徒毒打，身负重伤。
    1989年6月4日凌晨，王玉文所在卫生队奉命到民族宫附近的西兴盛胡同执行营救164名伤员任务。面对生与死的考验，他积极请战，坚决要求参加救护组。
    当车行至儿童医院门口时，遇到了一伙反革命暴徒和不明真相群众的拦截，车辆无法前进，他们被迫穿胡同、越小巷，绕道行进。行至白塔寺路口时，一伙手拿棍棒和砖头的暴徒将他们团团围住，蛮横地砸碎车上的玻璃，拖下司机和带队的张医生疯狂地毒打，并把王玉文和另一名卫生员关在车里，将车掀翻，尔后又把王玉文拖出车外。穷凶极恶的暴徒一拥而上，狂呼：“往死里打，往死里打”。顿时，王玉文被砖头、石块打得遍体鳞伤，当场昏了过去。失去人性的暴徒还不解恨，又把他的双腿用绳子绑住，拖向10多米远的“安全岛”示众，并猛踢他的头部，鲜血不断地滴到路上。暴徒见他一息尚存，竟残暴地在他的胸部压上一块20多斤重的水泥块，殴打凌辱达几个小时，直到4日早晨7时左右，王玉文才被战友从暴徒手中夺回。经检查，王玉文同志重度颅脑损伤、广泛脑挫裂伤、颅底骨折、双肾脏挫伤并肾功能衰竭，全身各处挫裂伤达103处，头部伤就有30处，生命垂危。经过精心治疗，现已转危为安。
    王玉文同志是武警部队的优秀战士，他热爱武警部队，热爱卫生事业。北京发生动乱以来，王玉文同志旗帜鲜明，坚决拥护党中央、国务院和中央军委的重大决策，自觉在思想上、政治上、行动上同党中央保持一致。在此期间，他积极向党组织提出申请，要求加入中国共产党，表现出坚定的政治立场和崇高的共产主义信念。
    机智勇敢的王志强
    王志强同志是中国人民武装警察部队北京市总队司令部内卫处副处长，山东莱州市人，汉族，高中文化程度，共产党员，1956年6月出生，1976年2月入伍，少校警衔。1989年4月中旬到6月上旬，他在参加制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，始终战斗在第一线。特别是在反革命暴乱发生后，党和国家面临危难之时，他挺身而出，勇挑重担，机智果断，与反革命暴徒进行了顽强的斗争，多次出色地完成了任务，充分表现了一个共和国卫士的英雄本色。
    在制止动乱中，他经常彻夜不眠，连续工作，坚决执行上级指示，组织部队很好地完成了任务。
    5月20日戒严令发布后，他在保证指挥、负责联络工作的5天中，连续3昼夜没休息，保证了指示、命令的及时传达贯彻。之后，他又连续3天3夜没休息，绘制图表，拟制方案，为首长及时提供了资料和依据。
    6月3日凌晨，在交通被堵的情况下，他带领一名司机，冲过了暴徒的拦截和围困，把上级急需的绝密文件按时送到了指定地点。在返回途中，王志强发现一伙暴徒正在围攻、殴打戒严部队的两名校官，并企图将其架上一辆面包车拉走，他一面让司机将车隐蔽好，一面冒险前去营救，机智地帮助二人进入美术馆执勤点保护起来。
    在6月3日晚至4日凌晨平息反革命暴乱战斗中，他奉命组织武警防暴队为戒严部队主力开进天安门广场强行开路。当车队行至玉泉路、永定路路口时，上千名暴徒和不明真相的群众将路口封锁，他机智地指挥司机先减速，选择好通道路口，尔后加速强行通过。当行至五棵松、万寿路路口时，遭到了暴徒们用石头、砖块的疯狂袭击。在此情况下，王志强跳下车，机智地引导车队迅速通过后，才冒着砸来的石头、砖块跑步登上指挥车。到达展开地域后，他主动向“前指”首长提出了防暴队在前正面突击，解放军两翼保护，并负责排除路障，大部队乘车跟进的战斗方案，得到了首长同意。此时，通往天安门的道路已被暴徒重重封锁，百余辆军车和公共汽车被砸被烧，推在路口当作路障，交通隔离墩、铁栅栏被横在道路上，并搭上棉被洒上汽油点燃，整条街道火光冲天，暴徒们狂呼乱叫“打死他们！烧死他们！”并凶残地用石头、水泥砖、汽水瓶、石灰包向部队袭击。王志强面对此情，沉着冷静，果断指挥防暴队员按方案编好突击队形，迅速做好冲锋准备，尔后高喊一声“同志们冲啊！”带领防暴队勇猛冲击，用催泪弹、电警棍和石块与暴徒展开了殊死搏斗。他一面指挥防暴队战斗，一面及时协调与解放军先头部队的配合，根据情况及时调整队形、战术及进攻节奏，使突击频频奏效。当防暴队一路突击，奋力打退复兴门一带暴徒的围攻堵截时，王志强立即向上级建议：不能停顿，抓紧战机，加速前进，一鼓作气直插天安门。建议获准后，他向防暴队和解放军先头部队高喊：“为了胜利，全速前进！”随即向暴徒发起猛烈进攻。同志们越战越勇，推进速度越来越快，并及时将重围之中的北京总队一支队350名官兵救出。战斗中，他冲锋在前，与暴徒展开面对面搏斗，腿部3处受伤，鲜血直流，全然不顾。他先后6次被临街楼上的暴徒用大块水泥砖击中头部，但他咬紧牙关，坚持没有倒下，率领防暴队打退了暴徒的一次次反扑，排除了一道道路障、火障，冲破了层层封锁，经过2小时45分钟的浴血奋战，同解放军先头部队一起，长驱30里，终于于4日凌晨1时45分胜利到达天安门广场，出色地完成了任务。
    到达天安门广场后，他又连续作战，参加了清理天安门广场的战斗。在复杂的情况下，根据我清场部队的任务和队形，为了及时掌握情况，便于统一指挥，他请求上级同意，只身一人超出部队30米，在前进行指挥，保证了任务的圆满完成。
    身先士卒的姜超成
    姜超成同志是中国人民武装警察部队北京市总队第五支队八中队中队长，湖北麻城县人，汉族，1962年8月出生，1980年11月入伍，中尉警衔。姜超成同志所在的中队，是一支机动特警分队。在执行平息首都反革命暴乱任务中，他带领防暴队员，不畏强暴，勇挑重担，历尽艰难，配合解放军先头部队，出色地完成了保护“前指”，实施尖刀突击，为戒严部队进入天安门广场强行开路的艰巨任务，为平息反革命暴乱，保卫党中央，捍卫中华人民共和国作出了突出的贡献。
    姜超成同志在带领防暴队实施开辟通路的战斗中，指挥果断，处置灵活。6月3日晚，接受护送“前指”任务后，他机智地命令在车上的战士脱下警服上衣，采取低坐姿，隐蔽开进的方法，保证部队安全准时到达指挥机关。在护送“前指”通过玉泉路和永定路口时，分别遭到上千人的拦截，他果断采取关灯后突然开灯，减速后突然加速等办法连闯两关。在五棵松路口，受到上万人的围追拦截和暴徒疯狂打砸，路障无法清除，部队前进受阻。姜超成同志带领防暴队员，冒着雨点般的石块、砖头和玻璃瓶，突然大吼一声冲下车来，使暴徒吓得不知所措，围观群众也向两旁散开，他边组织人员清除路障，边向预定目标开进，于22时20分，护卫“前指”安全到达军事博物馆。紧接着，姜超成同志带领分队接受了为戒严部队开进天安门广场实施正面开道任务。战斗中，面对异常复杂的情况，他沉着冷静，指挥灵活。在木樨地路口，有五六千人在暴徒的煽动下，丧心病狂地用石块、砖头向部队砸过来，不少同志身负重伤。他指挥防暴队采取弧形队形，相互保护，冒死向前推进。冲过大桥后，又连续遭到成千上万的暴徒和不明真相群众的疯狂袭击，部队再次严重受阻。面对这种情况，姜超成同志灵活指挥，重新编组，采取前三角队形向前突击，加快了前进速度，突破了一道道关卡。在整个战斗中，姜超成同志一面指挥战斗，一面利用各种时机，不间断地进行思想鼓动，提出了“一次成功，不能拉锯，团结一致，不能掉队”、“闯开一条血路，用生命捍卫人民共和国”等口号，极大地鼓舞了部队士气。
    姜超成同志在战斗中临危不惧，身先士卒。在五棵松路口，受到上万人的围攻和一伙暴徒的疯狂袭击，车辆被砸。他冒着生命危险第一个冲出车门，组织部队反击。在木樨地，由于暴徒看出他是个指挥员，“火力”集中到他身上，他的左小腿被石头砸伤，鲜血浸透了鞋袜，但他顾不上包扎，继续指挥战斗。在南礼士路口，右大腿和上身被暴徒用石块砸伤多处，他硬是拖着两条受伤的腿，忍着全身的伤痛，坚持指挥，并始终冲在队伍最前面。在复兴门立交桥东西两侧有数十辆燃烧着的车辆挡道，桥上桥下有数千人围攻，他高喊：“同志们跟我来！”第一个冲向随时可能爆炸的汽车，带领防暴队员从驾驶室里、车顶上、车底下冲了过去。当部队行至西单路口时，路面被暴徒铺上棉被，浇上汽油点燃，一片火障。他冒着雨点般的石块，站在最醒目的位置——交通安全岛上进行指挥，并亲自带领一个突击组冲向火海，一面扑火开道，一面向暴徒进行反击。胶鞋被烧坏了，脚也烫出了一个个血泡，他却全然不顾。在他和其他干部的带领下，经过两个多小时的连续拚搏和浴血奋战，全体防暴队员人人带伤，于4日凌晨1时45分引导解放军戒严部队胜利到达天安门广场，并顺利实施了清场任务。
