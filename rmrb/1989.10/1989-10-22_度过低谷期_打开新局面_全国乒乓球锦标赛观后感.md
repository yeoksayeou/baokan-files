Overcoming the Low Period and Opening a New Chapter

— Reflections on the National Table Tennis Championship

Few Spectators in the Stands

Head coach of the national women's team, Zhang Xianlin, pointed to the nearly empty stands and told reporters that this tournament had the fewest spectators in the history of the national table tennis championships.

Organizing sports competitions cannot do without spectators. One of the social functions of sports competitions is to provide people with healthy and elevated spiritual and cultural life. Our organizers often pay attention to scheduling, accommodations, transportation, and security, as well as how to attract sponsors. These are, of course, necessary conditions for successfully holding a competition. However, if we neglect the work of expanding the influence of the competition and attracting spectators through publicity, the competition becomes a matter of athletes playing and watching among themselves, producing little social benefit.

Zhang Xianlin said, “I saw that there were so few reporters in the venue, and I knew that there wouldn’t be many spectators. When we were playing, if a member of the national team lost a match, the next day the newspapers would have detailed reports. Now, even if a world champion loses, no one pays attention.” Zhang Xianlin believes that insufficient promotion of table tennis is a major reason for the sport's decline in recent years. I believe that holding such a major national tournament, in addition to strengthening news publicity, we can also organize more related activities to expand its influence. For example, outside the venue, we can hold exhibitions on the history and achievements of Chinese table tennis; invite table tennis equipment manufacturers to hold sales exhibitions; set up table tennis game tables to attract young children to play. Why can't we use our brains to make the competition more lively and exciting?

　　度过低谷期
    打开新局面
　　——全国乒乓球锦标赛观后感
    观众为何寥寥无几
    国家女队教头张燮林指着空荡荡的看台对记者说，这次比赛观众之少，恐怕也是创了历年全国乒乓球赛的纪录。
    办体育比赛离不开观众。体育竞赛的社会功能之一是为人们提供健康高尚的精神文化生活。我们的主办者往往只注意赛程编排、食宿交通、安全保卫等工作，以及如何拉赞助厂商。这些当然是办好比赛的必要条件，但若是忽略了扩大比赛影响、吸引观众的宣传工作，比赛就成了运动员自己打自己看，产生不了什么社会效益。
    张燮林说：“我一看场内记者这么少，就知道观众多不起来。我们打球那时候，国家队主力输一盘，第二天报上就会有详细报道。现在可好，世界冠军输了也没有人在意。”张燮林认为，对乒乓球宣传不够是近年这项运动在国内冷落的一个重要原因。笔者认为，举办这样的全国大赛，除需要加强新闻宣传外，还可多组织些有关活动扩大影响。比如在赛场外搞点我国乒乓球史和成就的展览；请乒乓球器材厂商来举办展销会；设置乒乓球游戏台吸引少年儿童来玩。我们为什么就不能开动脑筋把比赛办得更活跃热闹些呢？（下）
