Over the course of more than 50 days of turmoil, many students at Fudan University have remained steadfast in their political convictions. Eighteen students have submitted applications to join the Party and have submitted their ideological reports to the Party organization.

“Life gains meaning through thought and value through faith. If I do not express my beliefs and aspirations at a time when the Party's prestige is severely damaged, I would have failed in my duty as a true patriot.” This is the shared sentiment of the 18 students.

Among them are members of the “Future Journalists Club,” who traveled 20,000 miles over four months—journalism students Wu Yuehua and Liang Hong. After gaining a firsthand understanding of China's national conditions, they realized: “University students who merely engage in empty debates will only lead to misguided talk that harms the country. Today, China needs genuine construction and diligent work. The self-sacrificing spirit of soldiers on the southern border, and the hardworking, dedicated qualities of ordinary Party members in various fields, have deeply moved us. To shoulder the responsibility of building our country, we must have a firm faith to support us in facing various challenges. This realization has led us to aspire to become Communist Party members.”

There are also students who use their knowledge to analyze issues, remain correct in their views, and steadfast in their beliefs during the turmoil, such as Liu Gang from the history department. After studying modern Chinese history, he deeply felt: “History has repeatedly proven that our Party has always been the core leadership that best represents the interests of the entire nation and the hopes for national development. The Party has given the people the consciousness of standing up and taking control for the first time, the national consciousness of walking the socialist path for the first time, and the national consciousness of independence in the world for the first time. Therefore, upholding the Party's leadership is an undeniable political reality and historical choice for China. Every Chinese person who is determined to dedicate themselves to the country should unite around the Party, using the Party's wisdom and strength to transform and build China.”

    复旦十八位学生风波中申请入党
    在50多天的风波中，复旦大学有不少学生坚持正确的政治方向，先后有18位学生提出入党申请，向党组织递交了思想汇报。
    “人生因为思想而有意义，因为信仰而有价值。我如果在党的威信受到严重损害的关头，不提出我的信念、我的追求，我就丧失了一个真正爱国者的责任。”这是18位同学的共同心声。
    他们当中有行程二万里、历时四个月的“未来记者团”成员——新闻系的吴月华、梁弘，这两位大学生脚踏实地了解中国国情后，认识到：“大学生坐而论道，只会空谈误国。今天中国需要的是实实在在的建设和勤勤恳恳的工作。南疆战士的牺牲奉献精神，各行各业普通党员在平凡工作中任劳任怨的品质，都使我们感受至深。我们要承担起建设祖国的重任，就必须有一种牢固的信仰支持我们去面对各种考验，这种认识促使我们产生成为共产党员的庄严追求。”
    他们当中也有：运用所学知识分析问题，在动乱中认识正确、信仰坚定的同学，如历史专业的刘罡，学习中国近代史后，深有体会地说：“历史一再证明，我们党始终是最能够代表全民族利益和国家发展希望的领导核心。党使人民第一次有了翻身当家作主的意识，第一次有了走社会主义道路的国家意识，第一次有了独立自主于世界之林的民族意识……因此，坚持党的领导是中国不可置疑的政治现实和历史选择。每一个立志为国献身的中国人，都应团结在党的周围，运用党的智慧和力量，改造中国，建设中国。”
