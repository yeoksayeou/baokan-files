Shenzhen's public security and judicial departments have joined forces to launch another round of public crackdowns and severe strikes against black societies and gangs with black society characteristics.

Since August, various levels of public security organs in Shenzhen have carried out a "strike black and clean up gangs" special campaign. They have dismantled several black society organizations and gangs with black society characteristics, and arrested 1,467 other criminals, solving 1,227 criminal cases.

Shenzhen's black society organizations were severely struck down during the "strike hard" campaign in 1983. As the special economic zone continued to open up to the outside world, the infiltration activities of Hong Kong's black society organizations intensified, leading to the emergence of black society-like gangs in Shenzhen.

This round of "strike black and clean up gangs" campaign in Shenzhen has effectively curbed the arrogance of these black forces. Given the current situation where the leaders of black society organizations flee to Hong Kong, hide in mainland China, or stay in Shenzhen, the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau has promptly adjusted its strike strategy. By relying on public opinion and creating a strong presence, fully mobilizing the masses, drawing clear lines, and setting a deadline for surrender, the campaign has been successfully deepened.

    深圳严厉打击黑社会势力
    本报深圳讯　记者王楚报道：深圳市公安司法联手，再次掀起公开取缔、严厉打击黑社会和带黑社会性质帮派组织的行动。
    自8月份以来，深圳市各级公安机关开展了“打黑清帮”的专项斗争。破获一批黑社会组织成员、带黑社会性质的帮派组织，同时，还抓获其他犯罪分子1467人，破获刑事案件1227宗。
    深圳黑社会组织在1983年“严打”中，曾受到严厉打击。随着特区对外开放不断扩大，香港黑社会组织的渗透活动不断加剧，深圳黑社会性质帮派组织随之滋生出来。
    深圳这次“打黑清帮”突击行动，有力地打击了这股黑势力的嚣张气焰。根据目前黑社会组织“头头跑回香港、窜到内地避风、就地潜伏”的态势，深圳市公安局果断采取措施，调整打击战略，依靠舆论、大造声威，充分发动群众，划清界限，限定自首投案日期，把这场“打黑清帮”斗争有声有色地引向深入。
