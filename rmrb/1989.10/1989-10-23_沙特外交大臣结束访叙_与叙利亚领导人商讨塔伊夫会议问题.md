Saudi Foreign Minister Ends Visit to Syria

Discusses Taif Conference Issues with Syrian Leaders

BEIRUT, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) — Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Fahd concluded his two-day visit to Syria yesterday afternoon and departed for his home country. At the airport, he told the press that everyone is working hard for the success of the Taif Lebanese Parliament meeting. I have handed over a letter from King Fahd to President Assad and held talks with Vice President Khaddam and Foreign Minister Shar. The talks were fruitful. We hope this visit will help the Taif meeting succeed.

The Taif meeting has been ongoing for three weeks, with Lebanese deputies holding different views on the issues of "Lebanese sovereignty" and "Syrian withdrawal," leading to endless disputes. Lebanese Prime Minister Karami demanded that deputies from East Beirut stop attending the meeting and return to Lebanon. Prince Faisal's visit to Damascus came as the Taif meeting once again reached an impasse.

According to reports, Karami had asked Christian deputies from East Beirut to present three demands to the meeting: first, international guarantees for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon; second, the withdrawal of Syrian troops and their affiliated armed forces from the vicinity of the Lebanese Parliament venue to ensure the safety of the Parliament's convening and the presidential election; and third, a guarantee that Syria would withdraw from Beirut a few weeks after the presidential election and the formation of a national unity government. Syria rejected these demands, stating that Syria would honor its commitment to withdraw but would not accept any changes to the reconciliation plan formulated by the Arab League's three-party committee regarding Lebanon.

The Saudi Foreign Minister's visit to Syria will directly affect the future direction of the Taif meeting. According to Syrian media reports, the vast majority of Lebanese deputies are optimistic about the meeting and insist on announcing a national reconciliation plan. They predict that Lebanon will end the crisis, and if there are no unexpected circumstances, the Taif meeting will conclude in the near future.

　　沙特外交大臣结束访叙
    与叙利亚领导人商讨塔伊夫会议问题
    本报大马士革10月21日电  记者吕志星报道：昨天下午，沙特外交大臣费萨尔亲王结束了对叙利亚的两天访问，离开这里回国。他在机场对新闻界发表谈话说，大家都在为塔伊夫黎巴嫩议会会议的成功而尽力。我已向阿萨德总统转交了法赫德国王的信件，并同哈达姆副总统和沙雷外长进行了会谈，会谈是有成果的。我们希望这次访问有助于塔伊夫会议的成功。
    塔伊夫会议已持续了3周，黎议员们在有关“黎主权”和“叙利亚撤军”问题上各持己见，争吵不休。黎军政府总理奥恩前天要求贝鲁特东区的议员停止参加会议，返回黎巴嫩。费萨尔亲王就是在塔伊夫会议再次陷入僵局后来大马士革会晤叙领导人的。
    据报道，奥恩曾要求贝鲁特东区基督教派议员向会议提出三点要求，即，一，国际保证叙利亚从黎巴嫩撤军；二，叙军及其附属武装力量从黎会议会址周围撤出，以保证议会的召开及总统的选举的安全。三，黎总统选举及全国统一政府成立后几周内，保证叙从贝鲁特撤军。叙对此加以拒绝，并表示叙恪守撤军的诺言，但不接受对阿盟三方委员会所制定的有关黎和解方案作任何改变。
    沙特外交大臣对叙利亚的访问将直接关系到塔伊夫会议的今后方针。据叙利亚报刊报道，黎巴嫩绝大多数议员对会议抱乐观态度，并坚持宣布全国和解方案。
    他们预计黎巴嫩将结束危机，如无意外原因，塔伊夫会议将在近日内闭幕。
