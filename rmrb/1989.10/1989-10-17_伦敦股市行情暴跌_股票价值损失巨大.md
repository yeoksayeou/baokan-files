The London stock market experienced a dramatic plunge today, marking another "Black Monday" since the 1987 stock market crash, following the severe impact of the New York stock market's wild drop.

By 12:45 PM London time, the Financial Times stock index, based on the stock prices of 100 major companies, had fallen by 200 points, resulting in a loss of 38 billion pounds in stock value.

This morning at 9:00 AM London time, the opening prices at the London Stock Exchange had already dropped by 157 points. By 11:15 AM, the Financial Times stock index, based on the stock prices of 100 companies, had plummeted by 162 points, with stock value losses exceeding 25 billion pounds.

Today, the pound also depreciated by 3 pfennigs against the West German mark. The Bank of England is taking measures to support the pound.

Due to the stock market crash and considering the current high-interest rates and weak pound in the UK, there are concerns that a "new economic recession" may be on the horizon.

British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stated today: The 1987 stock market crash did not have a substantial impact on the "real economy," and today's stock market crash will not have a substantial impact on the British economy.

Currently, attention is focused on the New York Stock Exchange, which is set to reopen at 2:30 PM. Stock traders here are eagerly awaiting information from the New York Stock Exchange. Some analysts believe that Wall Street may try to limit the damage caused by this stock market crash.

    伦敦股市行情暴跌  股票价值损失巨大
    本报伦敦10月16日电  记者陈特安报道：在纽约股票市场行情狂跌的猛烈冲击下，今天伦敦股市行情暴跌，成为1987年股市狂跌以来的又一个“黑色的星期一”。
    到今天伦敦时间12点45分为止，以100家大公司、企业的股票价格为基础计算的金融时报股票指数下跌200点，股票价值损失达380亿英镑。
    今晨伦敦时间9点，伦敦股票交易所开盘价格就下跌了157点。到11点15分，100家公司的股票价格为基础的金融时报股票指数狂跌162点，股票价值损失已达250多亿英镑。
    今天，英镑对西德马克的比价也下跌了3芬尼，英格兰银行正在采取措施支持英镑。
    由于股市暴跌，又鉴于英国目前高利率、英镑疲软的形势，有人担心会导致一场“新的经济衰退”。
    英国财政大臣劳森今天说：1987年的股市暴跌并未给“真正的经济”带来实质性的影响，今天的股市暴跌也不致于给英国经济带来实质性的影响。
    眼下，此间人们注意力的焦点又回到2点30分将重开交易的纽约证券交易所。这里的股票商正在焦急地等待来自纽约交易所的信息。有分析家认为，华尔街可能会尽量限制这场股市暴跌造成的损失。
