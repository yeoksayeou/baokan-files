Cambodian resistance forces have intensified their attacks on Vietnamese troops remaining in Cambodia after Vietnam's supposed "complete withdrawal" at the end of September. According to a broadcast by the Democratic Kampuchea Radio, the resistance forces have successfully eliminated several Vietnamese military outposts in Battambang and Takeo provinces.

The broadcast reported that the Cambodian resistance forces recently launched a second attack on Vietnamese outposts in the Banteay Meanchey region. From September 27 to October 1, they successfully captured five outposts north of Banteay Meanchey, killing 31 Vietnamese soldiers and wounding 23. Subsequently, they captured three brigade-level outposts held by Vietnamese forces in Phnom Pong and other locations, posing a serious threat to the Vietnamese 309th Division's command post in Kong Pisey. Additionally, the resistance forces seized the Vietnamese outpost at Pongkor on the Sangkae River, cutting off a section of the 10th National Highway between Banteay Meanchey and Phnom Penh.

The broadcast also mentioned that on October 2, the Cambodian resistance forces captured two Vietnamese outposts in the Stung district of Takeo province, killing 6 Vietnamese soldiers and wounding 10, and seizing a batch of weapons and ammunition. On October 4, the resistance forces captured seven outposts in the Three Pagodas Pass area of Banteay Meanchey province, which were defended by the Vietnamese 330th Division, killing 25 enemy soldiers and wounding 20, and capturing 39 Phnom Penh puppet soldiers.

Furthermore, in the Mongkol district of Banteay Meanchey province, the Cambodian resistance forces attacked a Vietnamese naval convoy on September 27, sinking 7 ships and killing or wounding 27 soldiers.

The Democratic Kampuchea Radio also broadcasted a statement from the General Headquarters of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea on October 7, revealing that Vietnam still has 80,000 troops remaining in Cambodia after its supposed "complete withdrawal."

The statement provided details of the Vietnamese troop distribution in Cambodia based on intelligence gathered by the Cambodian resistance forces. Currently, the Vietnamese 309th Division (in Kong Pisey, Banteay Meanchey), 330th Division (in Three Pagodas Pass), 2nd Division (in Banteay Meanchey), and 5th Division (in Sisophon) are present in Banteay Meanchey province. Additionally, the Vietnamese 339th Division is in Leuk Daun district of Banteay Meanchey province, the 302nd Division is in Siem Reap province's Srei Snom district, Varin district, and Siem Reap airport, the 9th Division is in Oddar Meanchey and Kampong Speu provinces along the 26th National Highway, the 6th Division is in the southwest of Phnom Penh, and the 301st Division is in the eastern part of Kampong Cham and Kampong Thom provinces. Furthermore, the Vietnamese 307th Division is reportedly hiding in the Sre Ambel district of Takeo province and the Samraong district of Kampong Speu province.

The statement asserted that the latest evidence of Vietnamese troops remaining in Cambodia is the capture of 5 Vietnamese soldiers during the battle in Kong Pisey on October 3. These prisoners of war were presented to international journalists on October 5.

    声明公布了根据柬埔寨抵抗力量侦察获悉的越军在柬具体分布情况。现在马德望省内有越军309师（驻拜林地区的贡宾博）、330师（驻三洛）、第2师（驻拜林）、第5师（驻诗梳风）。此外，越军339师驻菩萨省列县，302师驻暹粒省三隆县、瓦楞县和暹粒机场，第9师驻奥多棉吉省和磅士卑省26号公路，第6师驻金边西南，301师驻磅湛省东部和波萝勉省。另有越军307师正隐藏在上丁省暹博县和磅同省山图克县。
    声明说，柬抵抗力量可提供的越军仍留在柬埔寨的最新证据是10月3日在拜林战斗中抓获的5名越军士兵。这些越战俘10月5日已与各国新闻记者见了面。
