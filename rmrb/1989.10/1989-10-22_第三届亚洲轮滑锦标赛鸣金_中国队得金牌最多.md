The Third Asian Roller Skating Championships concluded today after four days of intense competition.

A total of 7 gold medals were awarded today, with the Chinese team securing 4 of them. The men's and women's artistic roller skating all-around championships were won by the Shanghai siblings Zhu Wei and Zhu Ye. Zhu Ye also claimed the gold medal in the women's singles event. The Chinese team's other gold medal came from the roller hockey event. Japan's Takashi Koga and South Korea's Kim Yun-suk won the men's 5000m speed skating and women's 3000m speed skating gold medals, respectively. The pair skating gold medal was taken by Chen Qingming and Li Yahui from the Chinese Taipei team.

In this Asian roller skating competition, the Chinese team achieved the best results, securing 6 gold medals. South Korea followed with 5 gold medals, Chinese Taipei secured 3, and Japan obtained 2. Throughout the competition, the Chinese team's rapid rise in artistic roller skating and roller hockey, as well as Chinese Taipei's rise in artistic roller skating and speed skating, challenged the dominance of traditional roller skating powers Japan and South Korea. However, the 6 gold medals China secured did not include any from the speed skating events, indicating that the Chinese team still has some catching up to do in this area compared to Japan and South Korea. To fully surpass the Asian powerhouses, further efforts are needed.

　　第三届亚洲轮滑锦标赛鸣金
　　中国队得金牌最多
    本报杭州10月21日电　第三届亚洲轮滑锦标赛经过4天激烈角逐，今天鸣金收兵。
    今天共决出7枚金牌，中国队夺得其中的4枚。男、女花样滑全能冠军被上海轮滑兄妹朱炜、朱烨分享。朱烨还夺得女子单人滑金牌。中国队夺得的另一枚金牌是轮滑球。日本的高获昌利和南朝鲜的金允淑分别夺得男子5000米速滑和女子3000米速滑金牌。中国台北队的陈庆铭、李雅慧摘取了双人滑的金牌。
    本届亚洲轮滑赛，中国队成绩最佳，夺走6枚金牌，其次是南朝鲜队5枚，中国台北队获得3枚，日本队获得2枚。纵观本届比赛，中国队在花样滑、轮滑球项目上和中国台北队在花样滑、速滑项目上的迅速崛起撼动了轮滑强队日本、南朝鲜的垄断地位，但中国队这次获得的6枚金牌，无一枚是速滑项目，说明中国队在这个项目上与日本、南朝鲜等队尚有一定的差距，全面赶超亚洲强队尚须作进一步的努力。
