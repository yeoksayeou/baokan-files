United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar recently called for a rapid reduction in the external debt of Third World countries to reverse their deteriorating economic situation.

Pérez de Cuéllar stated in a report to the UN General Assembly that the $1.3 trillion in external debt held by Third World countries has hindered their economic development in the 1980s. He noted that economic development in Africa has stagnated, and the economic situation in Latin America has sharply deteriorated.

The Secretary-General attributed this economic decline to soaring interest rates. He said that rising interest rates have caused funds to continuously flow from developing countries to developed countries. The net flow of funds from debtor countries to creditor countries increased from $26 billion in 1987 to $33 billion in 1988, setting a historical record. He emphasized that since the external debt of most African countries is government loans, it is necessary to cancel 40% to 50% of this debt. It is understood that the heavy debt burden has increased the number of least developed African countries from 18 to 28 in recent years.

    联合国呼吁尽快减少第三世界债务
    联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔最近呼吁尽快减少第三世界国家外债，扭转这些国家日趋恶化的经济形势。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔在一份给联大的报告中说，第三世界国家的1.3万亿外债阻止了这些国家在80年代的经济发展。他说，非洲经济发展停滞，拉美经济急剧恶化。
    这位秘书长把这种倒退的经济形势归咎于高涨的利率。他说，利率的高涨已使发展中国家的资金不断流向发达国家，由债务国流入债权国的净资金从1987年的260亿美元增加到1988年的330亿美元，创历史最高纪录。他说，鉴于多数非洲国家的外债属于政府贷款，勾销40％到50％的债务是必要的。据了解，沉重的债务负担已使最不发达的非洲国家数目近几年内从18个增加到28个。
