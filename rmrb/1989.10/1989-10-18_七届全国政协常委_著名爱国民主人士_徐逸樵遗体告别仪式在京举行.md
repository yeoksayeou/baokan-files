Xu Yiqiao was born in Zhujia County, Zhejiang Province. He studied at the Tokyo Higher Normal School in Japan. In the spring of 1924, he returned to China and taught at the Zhejiang Provincial Law and Politics Specialized School and Shanghai Law and Politics University. Later, he worked in the Ministry of Education of the National Government. After 1937, he served as the secretary-general of the 20th Army Group and the political envoy of the 31st Army Group of the Nationalist Party. In 1940, he founded the Shaanxi Provincial Political Academy and served as its president. In 1944, he became the director of the Training Department of the Nationalist Party Central Organization Department. In 1946, he was sent to Japan as an advisor to the National Government's delegation. On the eve of the founding of New China, Xu Yiqiao resigned from his position as an advisor to the delegation in Japan, focusing on the study of Japanese history and engaging in patriotic activities. He was not concerned with personal gains or losses and made many beneficial efforts for Sino-Japanese friendship, the normalization of relations between the two countries, and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

In his early years, Xu Yiqiao was mainly engaged in the field of education. He was serious about his work, had a methodical approach to teaching, was a role model for teachers, and was meticulous in his duties, earning the respect of society and the love of his students. He was upright, sincere, lived a simple life, and had strict family discipline. In 1960, during a period of national difficulty, the Xu couple, with no one by their side, resolutely sent their young son back to China to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

Xu Yiqiao had a strong sense of national pride. Although he lived abroad for many years, he maintained a strong sense of justice and unwaveringly fought to uphold the dignity of the motherland and the rights of overseas and Japanese Chinese. Before returning to China, he donated a large batch of real estate and cash from the "Asia Society" Tokyo branch, which he had carefully preserved for many years, to the Chinese Embassy in Japan. After returning to China, he donated the imperial treasures he had collected overseas to the Chinese History Museum and the Palace Museum without compensation, receiving praise from the Party and the government. In August 1978, he finally returned to China to settle down, ending his more than 30-year overseas life and fulfilling his long-held wish. After returning to China, he served as an advisor to the Research Society of Sino-Japanese Relations, diligently writing articles and compiling Japanese history manuscripts despite his advanced age and frail health. During his tenure as a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, he actively participated in political consultations and democratic supervision, providing many valuable opinions and suggestions on the major policies of the Party and the state and the issues that the people care about.
