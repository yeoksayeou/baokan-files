	Nearly a million farmers are currently battling on the Songliao Plain in Jilin Province, seizing the opportunity to engage in agricultural water conservancy construction, striving to recover from one year of disaster and regain vitality the next.

	Jilin Province is one of China's major commercial grain bases. For many consecutive years, it has ranked first in the nation for per capita grain production, per capita commercial grain supply, grain export, and grain export. However, this year, the province's farmlands suffered extensive droughts, with most small rivers and streams drying up, and reservoirs and ponds severely lacking in water storage, making spring irrigation next year even more tense. Some regions experienced severe floods.

	Facing the severe losses caused by natural disasters, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government made arrangements in mid-July, requiring all levels of government to plan early, take early action, mobilize the masses to increase labor input as much as possible, and seize the opportunity to carry out summer and autumn agricultural water conservancy basic construction.

	By the end of September, the province had cumulatively invested 25.396 million man-days in agricultural water conservancy construction. The peak day saw 1.506 million laborers, completing 17,976 water conservancy projects and 61.319 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. According to incomplete statistics from Liaoyuan, Tonghua, and Yanbian, the masses raised 8.91 million yuan for water conservancy construction. The province is actively mobilizing to strive for over-fulfilling the annual task.

    近百万农民奋战松辽平原
    吉林农田水利建设势头好
    本报长春10月11日电　记者李安达报道：吉林省近百万农民目前正奋战在松辽平原，抓住时机搞农田水利建设，力争一年受灾，一年恢复生机。
    吉林省是我国重要商品粮基地之一，人均产粮、人均提供商品粮、调出粮食和出口粮食连续多年居全国首位。然而，该省农田今年大面积受旱，大多数小河溪水断流，水库塘坝蓄水严重不足，明年春灌用水将更为紧张。部分地区则发生特大洪灾。
    面对严重自然灾害造成的损失，省委、省政府于7月中旬就作了部署，要求全省各级政府早规划，早动手，发动群众尽可能多地增加劳务投入，抓紧时机开展夏秋两季农田水利基本建设。
    截至9月末，全省投入农田水利建设累计达2539.6万个工日，最多的一天上劳力150.6万个，开出水利工程1.7976万项，完成土石方总量6131.9万立方米。据辽源、通化、延边三个地区不完全统计，群众共自筹水利建设资金891万多元。全省上下正积极行动，争取超额完成全年任务。
