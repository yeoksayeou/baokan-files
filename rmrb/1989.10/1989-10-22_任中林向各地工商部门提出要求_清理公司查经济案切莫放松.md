Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 21st.

At the conclusion of a meeting of the heads of the commercial bureaus from 15 provinces and municipalities today, Ren Zhonglin, Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, demanded that local commercial administrative agencies concentrate their efforts on intensifying the cleanup and rectification of companies and the investigation of economic law violations. He emphasized that this work must not be allowed to slacken.

Ren Zhonglin pointed out that some places and departments have insufficient understanding of the need for further cleanup and rectification of companies, leading to a relaxation of efforts, fatigue, and a reluctance to face difficulties. Some, driven by localism, are unwilling to dissolve companies. Because the issue of understanding has not been resolved, some places are still waiting and observing, comparing with each other, which has affected the smooth progress of the cleanup and rectification.

Ren Zhonglin stated that the cleanup and rectification of companies is one of the seven major tasks identified by the Politburo to be prioritized, and it is also a necessity for the economic rectification. All companies that the central documents have stipulated to be dissolved must be resolutely dissolved. For companies that have been decided to be dissolved, after the liquidation is completed, they must be legally deregistered and their changes registered; for companies that have been decided to be retained, they must also be legally inspected and re-registered, and business licenses must be issued. Companies established by party and government organs, mass organizations, and social groups using administrative funds, companies that still have party and government officials holding concurrent positions in violation of central regulations, and companies that have not yet been investigated and closed for illegal activities, will not be inspected and re-registered for license renewal.

Ren Zhonglin pointed out that currently, the investigation of economic law violations is facing significant challenges and new situations. Firstly, there are many major cases; secondly, a considerable proportion of state-owned and collective enterprises and officials and employees are involved in the crimes. Local authorities must be determined to overcome interference and resolutely investigate these cases. Local commercial administrative agencies must consider the overall situation, strictly act in accordance with the law, and not act based on local interests, investigating only external cases and not local ones, being strict with external cases and lenient with local ones. It is also not permissible to use personal relationships to replace regulations and policies, and to plead for local law-breaking units.

### 任中林向各地工商部门提出要求  清理公司查经济案切莫放松

　　任中林向各地工商部门提出要求
　　清理公司查经济案切莫放松
    本报北京10月21日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：在今天结束的15省市工商局长座谈会上，国家工商行政管理局局长任中林要求各地工商行政管理机关集中力量，把清理整顿公司、查处经济违法案件的工作抓紧抓好，切不能放松。
    任中林指出，现在有些地方和部门，对进一步清理整顿公司认识不足，出现了松劲、厌烦和畏难的情绪；有的从本位主义出发，不愿撤并公司。由于认识问题未解决，有的地方仍在等待观望，互相攀比，影响了清理整顿的顺利进行。
    任中林说，清理整顿公司是中央政治局确定要抓好的7件大事之一，也是治理整顿的需要。凡是中央文件规定撤并的公司，必须坚决撤并。凡是决定撤并的公司在清算结束后，要依法办理注销和变更登记；对确定保留的公司，也要依法进行年检和重新登记注册，核发营业执照。对于那些党政机关、群众组织、社会团体用行政费等开办的公司、违反中央规定仍有党政机关干部兼职的公司、违法违章尚未查处结案的公司，一律不予年检和重新登记换照。
    任中林指出，当前经济违法案件查处难度大，并出现了一些新的情况。一是大案要案多；二是国营、集体单位和干部、职工参与作案的占有较大比重。各地应痛下决心，排除干扰，坚决查处。各地工商行政管理机关必须顾全大局，严格依法办事，不能从地方利益出发，只查外地不查本地，对外地严对本地宽，更不能允许以感情代替法规和政策，为本地违法单位说情。
