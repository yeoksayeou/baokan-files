The young Tibetan poet Ma Lihua's reportage essay "Journey to Northern Tibet," published in the fourth issue of *Northwest Military Literature* in 1989, is a 120,000-word long work. The essay recounts the author's seven journeys into the mysterious Northern Tibet and her observations and feelings. On this land of over 400,000 square kilometers, the harsh natural environment, the grand and majestic landscapes, the rugged and open national character, and the rich cultural customs all converge to form the unique spirit of the Tibetan people. The author, with a simple and sincere pen, depicts the history, culture, and customs of Northern Tibet, weaving together the unique highland lakes, historical legends, sky burials, life totems, and local products and customs into a colorful artistic tapestry.

Recently, the editorial department of *Northwest Military Literature*, the creation group of the Tibet Military Region, and the editorial department of *Tibet Literature* jointly held a discussion meeting on the work. The attendees believed that the author, with her love for the Tibetan people and a strong sense of self, not only showcased the magical natural scenery of Northern Tibet but also depicted the culture created by this people in harsh conditions. The work delves into the origins of human civilization and religion, the development of national culture, and the psychology of the people, endowing this land with rich connotations. Many comrades believe that the author, being a Han Chinese woman, has repeatedly ventured into the harsh conditions of the brotherly nationalities to gather materials and live among the people. This practice of using reportage to express the long history and culture, and to reflect the spirit of the times, is very beneficial.

    《藏北游历》讨论会
    西藏青年诗人马丽华发表在《西北军事文学》一九八九年第四期上的纪实散文《藏北游历》是一部十二万字的长篇作品，作品记叙了作者七次深入神秘的藏北的见闻感受。在这块四十多万平方公里的土地上，严峻的自然环境，壮阔雄浑的风物景观，粗犷豪放的民族性格，浓厚的文化风俗，凝聚为独特的藏民族之魂。作者以朴实真挚的笔触描绘了藏北的历史、文化和民情，那特有的高原湖泊、历史传说，天葬、生命图腾、物产民俗等绘织成一幅多彩的艺术画卷。
    最近，《西北军事文学》编辑部、西藏军区创作组、《西藏文学》编辑部联合召开了作品讨论会。与会者认为，作者以对藏民族的热爱之情和强烈的主体意识，既展示了藏北神奇的自然风光，又描绘了这个民族在艰苦的环境中创立的文化，对人类文明和宗教的起源、民族文化的发展、民族的心理等都进行了艺术的探寻，赋予这块土地以丰富的内涵。不少同志认为，作者是一位汉族女性，多次深入到条件艰苦的兄弟民族采风、生活，对于散文创作表现悠久的历史文化，表现时代的精神，是一次有益的实践。　（一文）
