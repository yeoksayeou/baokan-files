Reviewing the past few years of literary creation and theoretical exploration, we cannot ignore the fact that there is a very dangerous trend in the literary and intellectual circles. Some people emphasize feelings, intuition, and the subconscious, while completely dismissing human rationality, reducing the exploration of the human soul in literature to the expression of low-level unconscious ideologies, treating human instinctual desires as the sole driving force and source of life, and regarding the irrational and unrestrained biological instincts, stripped of reason, as the eternal human nature. The inevitable result is to fall into the irrationalist quagmire of anti-reason, anti-morality, and anti-human civilization. Liu Xiaobo's "Naked and Bare, Heading Towards God" is a prime example of this irrationalist "masterpiece" (see the 4th issue of 1986, "Appreciation of Masterpieces," for the same quotes below). In Liu Xiaobo's view, since human nature is the biological instinct of humans, since all human vices and virtues are driven by this insatiable instinctual desire, then why bother with the pretenses of civilization and morality? Just tear off all the rational disguises, expose the naked body, and return to the original form of the beast. This way, wouldn't it be more authentic to approach the heart's God and enter a world of absolute freedom! How liberating! But this is not the truth; it is an absurd conclusion drawn from a correct premise.

Indeed, humans have a cunning, deceitful, and brutal side. Hamlet's famous soliloquy is not a celebration of humanity but an expression of doubt and negation of human rationality due to the observation of human ugliness. However, if the entire history of human development is not a tragedy, then Hamlet's tragedy should not be the tragedy of all humanity. Instead, humanity should gain some enlightenment from Hamlet and establish its own value. However, Liu Xiaobo draws the opposite conclusion, believing that "in essence, humans are not rational beings but beings of desire," that "rationality, morality, and conscience are merely the fig leaves used by Adam and Eve to cover their nakedness to satisfy their shame," and that "one of the main functions of human civilization is to serve as this fig leaf." What a pitiful fig leaf! It turns out that human rationality, morality, conscience, and civilization are so worthless, merely tools and means to cover up the "essential world" of humans, while "extreme evil forces all originate from the deepest layers of the essential world of humans." If this is used to expose the hypocrisy and deceitfulness of evil forces using human civilization to cover up their ugly deeds, it would not be without insight. However, Liu Xiaobo places evil and goodness, nobility and baseness on the same scale. Whether it is the noble and sacred Eve and Adam or the vicious and despicable Macbeth couple, they all engage in love and murder behind the same fig leaf, and they all have the same rationality because they are all beings of desire, satisfying the same desires of the "essential world." In this case, what distinction is there between good and evil, or between the worthy and the unworthy? What value does human civilization, which drives historical progress, have to speak of? The cynical irrationalists dismember the organic life of humans, which is a fusion of sensory and rational forces, and separate the rational and moral forces that determine the value of human life from the essential attributes of humans. Thus, in the human life system, what is worth affirming is the wild force determined by human biological instincts. Therefore, Shylock's brutality and greed, King Lear's folly and selfishness, are the most lovable human nature. In Liu Xiaobo's words, "this is the human, the deep essence of humans suppressed by rationality." This "deep essence" theory actually confuses the fundamental difference between humans and animals, reducing humans to the level of animals, ignoring that the history of several thousand years of civilization is the history of humans continually struggling against barbarism, ignorance, and folly. Its absurdity and ignorance are evident.

In search of theoretical support for his irrationalism, Liu Xiaobo adopts Freud's "three-part personality structure" theory. However, when it comes to the rational core of Freud's theory, he regresses surprisingly, mutilating the complete theoretical system into a mess, beyond recognition. He vigorously denies the power of the "superego" personality and regards the "id," determined by the subconscious, as the sole driving force of human life, believing that "the subconscious is always alive, full of adventurous and rebellious spirit. The vitality, richness, and depth of a person's life fundamentally depend on this person's subconscious psychology." We know that the subconscious is determined by human instinctual desires. Freud's "id" or "It" is merely the personification of these instinctual desires, "possessing primitive and irrational qualities," and "its sole content is to seek the release of instinctual impulses." The "superego is the representative of all moral constraints, seeking the impulse for perfection or higher behavior in human life." If the "id" is separated from the supervision of the "superego" and the protection of the "ego," then a person would not be able to survive even for a day. This is because human instinctual desires are always restrained by powerful external forces. If humans act according to their subconscious instinctual desires, seeing a young woman and immediately plotting evil, they would surely end up with broken heads and bloody faces! At this time, the "ego" plays a role in saving the "id." Freud says: "The ego provides the id with information from the external world, thus saving it. Otherwise, if the id seeks to satisfy its instincts completely without regard for powerful external forces, it would be difficult to avoid destruction." "The ego represents rationality and prudence, while the id represents untamed passions." It is clear that the "id," "ego," and "superego," "rational and sensory forces" are interdependent and inseparable. Isolating and emphasizing the animalistic instincts of the "id," elevating it to an unparalleled position, can only lead people into dangerous territory.

In Liu Xiaobo's view, all human activities originate from biological instinctual desires and selfish nature, and no one can escape this inescapable "vicious circle." In his bizarre writing, there is a passage that is most persuasive yet misleading: "The foundation of love, praised as sacred, is sex, the hunger and anxiety of the flesh. The foundation of patriotism, revered, is the personal interests of each individual. Self-love is the root of all love. The brilliance of creation, respected, is the desire to possess everything, control everything, and enjoy everything." We do not deny that psychological needs and physiological needs, sublime spirits and personal interests, creative activities and material desires are unified, opposing aspects. Physiological needs, personal interests, and material desires are often the starting point of a psychological need, sublime spirit, or creative activity, but not the unchanging sole driving force. Love is a psychological need, and sexual desire is a physiological need. Love often arises from the mysterious attraction of the opposite sex. Baoyu saw Lin Daiyu and immediately felt this mysterious attraction of the opposite sex. In terms of sexual love, the goal is to seek satisfaction through sex, and the relationship with the opposite sex is based on sex. But Freud believes: "An instinct's relationship with its goal and object is not difficult to change," "the change in the relationship of goal and object has more social value; this special kind can be called 'sublimation,'" "for example, love can belong to this category, because sexual love indeed originates from sexual needs but often stops satisfaction," resulting in a "persistent object attachment and persistent drive," which is the truly noble and pure love of humanity: based on sexual love but ultimately transcending sexual love, reaching the perfect harmony of two souls in human high-level male-female love. Only this love truly shines with the beautiful light of humanity; only this love has the persistence and immense inner drive of eternal fidelity and mutual longing; only this love is not satisfied with sensory stimulation of the flesh but reaches a great sublimation; only this love escapes the entanglements of money, status, and other human temptations and gains a true social value of life. Patriotism is undoubtedly a sublime emotion, and its initial driving force may not be separated from the concern for personal interests. This is precisely the basic premise for people of all classes and strata to unite and resist together when national interests and national dignity are violated. However, preserving oneself can also, under certain conditions, become an instinct that "retreats from its goal" as Freud says, that is, "the goal is clear, but often its satisfaction is abandoned." Life faces powerful enemies and extremely harsh environments, and the national consciousness stirred up by the atmosphere of the times is fully displayed, forming an irresistible great spiritual force. Thus, the instinct for life no longer seeks personal survival as its goal, and patriotism completely transcends personal interests, sacrificing everything, including life, for a glorious sacrifice. Therefore, there is Qu Yuan, who advised and was slandered, ending his life in the Miluo River; Wen Tianxiang, who survived nine deaths and is immortal; and Shi Kefa, who defended Yangzhou and was buried at Meihua Ridge. This is the sublimation of patriotism. As for creation, in terms of its specific creative subject, the initial driving force of the creative process may not be separated from a certain utilitarian relationship, but just as love and all sublime spirits, the creative activity itself can also transcend personal utilitarian desires and reach a selfless state. Therefore, throughout history, there have been so many great martyrs and outstanding figures who have become shining examples for later generations' creative activities. Prometheus in ancient Greek mythology is a great creator who stole fire for humanity and did not bow to the emperor of heaven; Bruno also had an unyielding soul that fearlessly faced the stake for the sake of exploring the truth of the universe; Madame Curie found a great source of wealth for humanity but rejected any patents. Did they ever think of personal possession? However, how many emperors and nobles, who wanted to "possess everything, control everything, enjoy everything," ended up with their "ten thousand palaces turning into dust," while those scientists, inventors, writers, artists, and philosophers who made outstanding contributions to humanity shine in history and have their names immortalized. Can their brilliant achievements and great spirit of exploring without fear of fire, imprisonment, or severe punishments be explained by the instinctual desire for possession? If it were only to satisfy one's own instinctual desires, then why did these creators of material and spiritual civilization not fear fire, imprisonment, or severe punishments? Can this be explained by biological instincts? Humans, after all, are not animals. Their spirits, wills, emotions, and behaviors are all subject to social constraints, rational control, and conscious guidance. How can they be entirely attributed to the subconscious determined by non-logical, non-rational, and non-conscious instinctual impulses?

The irrationalism currently in vogue is essentially an extreme form of historical idealism. Liu Xiaobo repeatedly emphasizes that "the evil of the subconscious is the essence of humans," and that human sexual instincts and the desire for possession are the "true human driving forces" for human development and the existence of human civilization. According to this logic, the richer one's subconscious psychology and the stronger one's desire for possession and destructiveness, the more vigorous one's life force, and the stronger the "human driving force" that promotes human development and builds human civilization. Then, aren't figures like Ximen Qing, Wang Xifeng, Grandet, and Shylock, who are lecherous, demonic, and gold-crazy, all great representatives of "human driving forces"? These historical villains have become the driving forces of human development, and the wreath of human civilization should be placed on their heads, while those who truly demonstrate human strength, with human courage and wisdom, human emotions and ideals, human virtues and beliefs, actively engage in the world, strive with vigor, and exhibit a righteous spirit in the struggle for human progress, national prosperity, and national revitalization, are condemned by Liu Xiaobo as "upright gentlemen" who "maintain a surface harmony by suppressing instincts with reason," becoming "inhuman" villains. This inverted logic, not to mention being contrary to Marxist historical materialism, would even be considered a bizarre tale by anyone with normal rationality.

Under the influence of pessimism, Liu Xiaobo naturally draws an irrationalist aesthetic conclusion: since humans cannot satisfy the instinctual desires of individual life to the fullest in reality, they can only "embrace this enemy in aesthetics, discover, express, and experience this life's turmoil and noise in a terrifying, disillusioned, and desperate mood." Therefore, "what is often defined as evil by reason is precisely the most charming focal point in aesthetics," which is only natural. Such an aesthetic view leads to an irrationalist literary view. Liu says in another article: "My literary view is that there is no such thing as reason, and any introduction of rational factors will inevitably, to some extent, damage the purity of literary aesthetics. In China, one cannot talk about the unity of sensibility and reason." "When dialoguing with traditional culture, one must emphasize the following to the extreme: sensibility, irrationality, instinct, and flesh." (October 3, 1986, "Shenzhen Youth Daily": "Crisis, the Crisis Facing New Period Literature") In the midst of the anti-realism clamor, is there any call more brazen, more thorough, and more shocking than this? Is it only the inhuman brutality, greed, murder, rape, and plunder that are the "focal points" of aesthetics, allowing people to embrace the enemy of instinctual desires from the "terror and despair," and satisfy the "eternally active, never-dying subconscious desires" from the great robbers, bandits, and hooligans? While those rational and sensible, loving, brave, and full-of-life men and women, such as Portia, who defeated the devil Shylock with law and wisdom, Maslova, who rejected Nekhlyudov's grace with clear rationality, and Liu Lanke and her husband, who fought to the death against feudal traditions, are all expelled from the temple of literature and art? Then, the sacred palace of art becomes a place of filth and darkness, a dark cave to satisfy instinctual needs! What else is there to say? The logic of irrationalists is like this. Don't think this is just a momentary outburst of extremism; in reality, it represents an extremely reactionary artistic trend. Its core is to oppose the moral purification function of literature, oppose the justice and people-oriented nature of literary endeavors, oppose the socialist direction of literature serving the people, and oppose the great guiding significance of Marxism on literary creation. Under the impact of this trend, we can clearly see that the pursuit of strong sensory shots, non-logical associations, and unconscious descriptions are all on stage. Even in some sensational works, we can see the withered spiritual vitality of instinctual impulses and primitive wildness, not to mention those bizarre sexual descriptions: sexual frustration, sexual indulgence, sexual madness, sexual promiscuity, sexual possession, sexual interference, sexual abnormality, sexual revenge, sexual multiplicity, sexual recognition, sexual religion, sexual symbolism... and so on, truly shocking and bizarre. This is the so-called "naked and bare" spectacle. Apart from serving as a blower for the capitalist society of rampant desires, moral degradation, and crazy plunder, what other role can this art play? The result is that it will not only fail to reach the kingdom of heaven but will plunge into the abyss of human sin.

    赤身裸体，走向深渊
    ——评刘晓波的非理性主义美学观
    蒋兆祥
    回顾数年来的文艺创作和理论探索，我们不能不看到，文艺界和思想界存在着一种十分危险的倾向，一些人一味强调感觉、直觉、潜意识，而把人类的正常理性打入十八层地狱，把文学对人物心灵世界的探索仅仅归结为对低层次的无意识形态的表现，把人的本能欲望当成是人的唯一生命动力和源泉，把剥离了理性的盲目不羁的生物本能当成是万古不变的人性，结果必然陷入反理性、反道德、反人类文明的非理性主义泥坑。刘晓波的《赤身裸体，走向上帝》便是一篇反理性主义的“杰作”（见1986年第4期《名作欣赏》，下文引文同）。在刘晓波看来，既然人性就是人的生物性本能，既然人类的一切罪恶和德行都是由这种贪得无厌的本能欲望所驱使，那么，还要装模作样讲什么文明、道德，干脆撕掉一切理性的外衣，裸露着赤条条的身子，还其动物的原形，这样岂不更接近心中的上帝，走向绝对自由的世界！真是痛快。但这不是真理，而是从一个正确的前提得出的荒谬绝伦的结论。
    不错，人类有着阴险、狡猾、凶残的一面。哈姆雷特那段著名的独白也不是对人的肯定和颂扬，而是因见出人的丑恶表现了对人类理性的怀疑和否定。但是，只要整个人类发展史不是一部悲剧史，那么，哈姆雷特的悲剧就不应是整个人类的悲剧，而人类倒应从哈姆雷特身上获取某种领悟和启迪，从而确立自身的价值。而刘晓波却由此得出了相反的结论，认为“人在本质上不是理智的动物，而是情欲的动物”，认为“理性、道德、良心”“只不过是亚当和夏娃用来掩盖裸体，以满足羞耻的遮羞布”，“人类文明的主要功用之一便是充当这块遮羞布”。好一块可怜的遮羞布！原来人类的理性、道德、良心和文明竟是如此地一钱不值，都不过是用来遮盖人的“本体世界”的工具和手段，而“极端邪恶力量”又“都发自人的最深层的本体世界”，那么，理性以及由此生成的美丽花圃便是邪恶力量的隐蔽所。如果以此揭露邪恶势力盗用人类文明以掩盖丑恶行径的虚伪和欺骗性，那也不失为有识之士。可是刘晓波却是把邪恶和善良、高尚和卑劣放在同一个戥盘上，无论是高尚圣洁的夏娃、亚当，还是凶恶可鄙的麦克白夫妇，都在同一块遮羞布背后做爱、杀人，而且都有着同样的合理性，因为他们都是作为情欲的动物，满足同样的“本体世界”的情欲需要。这样，人类还有什么善恶之分、良莠之别？推动历史进步的人类文明还有什么价值可言？玩世不恭的非理性主义者肢解了人由感性力量和理性力量融合而成的有机生命整体，把决定人的生命价值的理性、道德力量从人的本质属性中割离开去，那么在人的生命系统中值得肯定的就是由人的生物本能所决定了的野性力量，于是夏洛克的凶残和贪婪，李尔王的昏聩和自私，便是最为可爱的人类本性，用刘晓波的话来说，“这才是人，是被理性所压抑的人的深层本质”。这种“深层本质”论，实际上混淆了人与动物的根本区别，把人降低到与动物为伍的位置，无视几千年的文明史就是人类不断与野蛮、愚昧、昏聩作斗争的历史，其荒谬与无知是显而易见的。
    为了寻找其非理性主义的理论根据，刘晓波捡来了弗洛伊德的“三部人格结构”论，但是，当其涉及到弗氏理论的合理内核时，却又发生了惊人的倒退，将其完整的理论体系阉割得鸡零狗碎，面目全非。他竭力否定“超我”的人格力量，而把由潜意识所决定了的“本我”作为人的生命的唯一动力，认为“潜意识始终是活生生的，富于冒险精神和反抗精神。一个人的生命力是否旺盛、丰富、深邃，在根本上取决于这个人的潜意识心理”。我们知道，潜意识是由人的本能欲望所决定的，弗氏所说的“本我”或“伊底”只是这种本能欲望的人格化，“具有原始的及非理性的品质”，“它所有唯一的内容”，“就是力求发泄本能的冲动”（见《精神分析引论新编》，下文同），而“超我是一切道德限制的代表，要追求完美的冲动或人类生活的较高尚行为的主体”，如果“本我”离开“超我”的监督和“自我”的保护，那么，人一天也难以存活。这是因为人的本能欲求总是受强大外力的遏制。人如随心所欲，完全按照潜意识的本能欲望办事，如看到一妙龄女郎即欲谋不轨，那不碰得头破血流才怪呢！这时，“自我”便发挥了挽救“本我”的作用，弗氏说：“自我以外界的消息供给伊底，从而挽救了它，不然，倘若伊底力求满足其本能而完全不顾强大的外力，便难于灭亡了。”“自我代表理性和审慎，至于伊底则代表了不驯服的激情”。可见“本我”与“自我”、“超我”，“理性和感性力量”是相互依存、不可分割的，孤立地强调“本我”的动物性本能，将其抬到至高无尚的地位，只能把人们引向危险的境地。
    在刘晓波看来，人类的一切活动都是从生物的本能欲望和自私本性出发的，没有一个人能超越这个无法逃脱的“怪圈”。在他的奇文中有一段讲得最为振振有词而又似是而非的话：“被赞美为圣洁的爱情的基础是性，是肉的饥渴和焦灼，被敬仰的爱国主义的基础是每个人的切身利益，自爱是一切爱的根基，被尊重的创造的辉煌的深处是占有一切，支配一切，享有一切的欲望。”我们并不否认，心理需要和生理需要、崇高精神和个人利益，创造活动和物质欲求是统一的，矛盾对立的两个方面。生理需要、个人利益、物质欲求往往是一种心理需要、崇高精神、创造活动的出发点，但不是始终不变的唯一动力。爱情是心理的需要，性欲是生理的需要，爱情往往由于对异性的性感诱力引起，宝玉一见到黛玉就产生了这种神秘的异性引力，就性爱而言，以性的满足和达成为追求目标，与异性对象的关系以性为基础，但弗洛伊德认为：“一个本能对于其目标及对象的关系是不难变更的”，“目标及对象关系的改变更加具有一种社会的价值；这特殊的一种可称为‘升华’”，“例如爱情可隶属于此类，因为性爱确起源于性的需要，但常制止满足”，结果乃产生一种“持久的对象倾注及持久的驱力”，这便是人类真正高尚、纯洁的爱情：基于性爱而最后又超越了性爱、达到两颗灵魂完全契合的人类高层次的男女之爱。只有这种爱，才真正闪烁着美好的人性之光；只有这种爱，才具有坚贞不渝、死守相望的持久性和以全部感情倾注的巨大内驱力；只有这种爱，才不是以肉体的感官刺激为满足而达到一种伟大的升华；只有这种爱，才摆脱了金钱、地位等人生诱力场的名缰利索而获得一种真正的人生社会价值。爱国主义无疑也是一种高尚的感情，其当初的驱动力也许离不开对个人切身利益的关注。这正是国家利益和民族尊严受到侵害时，各个阶级和阶层的人之所以能团结一致、共同御侮的基本前提。但，保存自己，同样也可以在一定条件下成为如弗氏所说的“目标退隐”的本能，即“目标也甚明确，但往往放弃其满足”，生命自我面对强大的敌人和极其险恶的环境，将那被时代氛围激荡起来的民族意识竭力张扬，形成一种不可遏制的巨大精神力量。于是，生之本能便不再以个人求生为追求目标，爱国主义便完全超越了个人的利害关系，而将个人的一切以至生命弃之不顾而作壮烈的牺牲。因此，才有屈原谏而遭谤自尽于汩罗江，文天祥九死一生而万古流芳，史可法死守谁扬而葬于梅花岭上。这便是爱国主义的升华。至于创造，就其具体的创造主体来说，创造过程的最初动力也许都离不开一定的功利关系，但正如爱情和一切崇高精神一样，创造活动本身也可以达到对个人功利欲求的超越而进至忘我的境界。正因为如此，古今中外才有那么多伟大的殉道者和杰出人物成为后人创造性活动的光辉楷模。古希腊神话中的普罗米修斯便是为人类窃取火种而不向天帝屈服的伟大创造者；布鲁诺同样有一颗为探索宇宙真理而面对火刑无所畏惧的不屈的灵魂；居里夫人为人类找到了巨大的财富之源，却拒绝任何专利，他们何曾想为个人占有什么？然而，又有多少想“占有一切，支配一切，享受一切”的帝王将相随着他们占据的“宫阙万间都做了土”，而那些为人类作出杰出贡献的科学家、发明家、文学家、艺术家、哲学家却彪炳史册，英名永存，能用占有狂的本能欲望来解释他们的光辉业绩和置个人生死于度外的伟大探求精神吗？如果仅仅是为了满足自己的本能欲求，那么，这些物质文明和精神文明的创造者为什么不怕火烧，不怕坐牢，不怕万般惩罚的严酷？这是能用生物本能解释得了的吗？人，毕竟不是动物，他的一切精神、意志、感情和行为无不受社会的制约、理智的支配、意识的指导，岂能完全归结于非逻辑、非理性、非自觉的由本能冲动决定了的潜意识？
    目前流行的非理性主义实质上是一种极端的历史唯心主义。刘晓波一再强调的是“潜意识的邪恶正是人的本质之所在”，人的性本能和占有欲便是“人类得以向前发展，人类文明得以产生和存在的真正的人性动力”。按照这种逻辑，谁的潜意识心理越丰富，“占有欲和破坏性”越强烈，谁的生命力就越旺盛，促使人类发展，建造人类文明的“人性动力”就越强大，那么，像西门庆、王熙凤、葛朗台、夏洛克这类淫棍、恶魔、拜金狂不都成了真正“人性动力”的伟大代表？这些历史的丑类反倒成了人类发展的动力，人类文明的花环反倒应该戴到他们的头上，而那些真正显示着人性力量的志士仁人，以人的胆识和智慧，人的情怀和理想，人的德行和信仰积极入世，奋发有力，在为人类进步、国家兴旺、民族昌盛的斗争中，表现出一种与邪恶力量针锋相对的堂堂正气，却被刘晓波斥责为“借助于理性对本能的压抑维持一种灭绝人性的表面和谐”的“正人君子”，反倒成了“灭绝人性”的歹毒之徒，这种颠倒了的逻辑，不要说与马克思主义的历史唯物史观背道而驰，就是对于每个具有正常理性的人，也会认为是海外奇谈。
    在悲观主义的支配下，刘晓波很自然地得出了反理性主义的美学结论：人既然不能在现实中让生命个体的本能欲望得到最大满足，那只有“在审美中去拥抱这个死敌，在恐怖的、幻灭的、绝望的心境中去发现、去表现、去体验这种生命的骚动和喧哗”，那么，“往往被理性认定的邪恶，正是审美中最具魅力的聚光点”，也就是理所当然。由这样的美学观又导致了非理性主义的文学观。刘在另外的文章里说：“我的文学观就是没有什么理性可言，任何理性因素的介入都必然在某种程度上损害文学的审美的纯洁性。在中国就不能谈什么感性和理性的统一这类字眼。”“在和传统文化对话的时候，就得把这样一些东西强调到极点：感性、非理性、本能、肉。”（1986年10月3日《深圳青年报》：《危机，新时期文学面临危机》）在反现实主义的一声鼓噪声中，有哪一种比这放肆的叫嚷显得更露骨、更彻底、更骇人听闻！难道只有那些反人道的凶残暴戾、贪婪狡诈、杀人越货、奸淫掳掠才是审美的“聚光点”，人们才能从“恐怖和绝望”中去拥抱那个本能欲望的死敌，从那些大盗积贼、流氓土匪身上望梅止渴地满足一下“永远活动，永不死亡的潜意识欲望”，而那些闪烁着理性之光的可爱形象，如以法律和智慧战胜了恶魔夏洛克的鲍细娅，以清醒的理智拒绝了聂赫留道夫的恩赐的玛丝洛娃，以生命与封建传统作拚死抗争的刘兰芝夫妇，这些理性与感性相结合的善良、勇敢、充满生命活力的男男女女不都要被逐出文学艺术的殿堂？那么，神圣的艺术之宫不就成了藏污纳垢之处，成了满足本能需要的黑暗洞穴！还有什么可说的呢？非理性主义者的逻辑就是如此。别以为这只是痛快一时的偏激之词，实际上代表了一种极端反动的文艺思潮，它的核心就是反对文学的道德净化功能，反对文学事业的正义性和人民性，反对文艺为人民大众服务的社会主义方向，反对马克思主义对文艺创作的巨大指导意义。在这股思潮的冲击下，我们可以清楚地看到，那种追求强刺激的肉感镜头，那种非逻辑联想和下意识描写纷纷登场，即使在一些轰动一时的作品中，也可见到那种在庸常之作中所常见的枯萎了精神活力的本能冲动、原始野性，更不用说那些千奇百怪的性描写：性苦闷、性放纵、性疯狂、性野合、性占有、性插足、性失常、性报复、性多维、性认让、性宗教、性象征……等等，真是惊世骇俗，无奇不有。这就是所谓“赤身裸体”的洋洋大观。这种文艺除了赤裸裸地充当人欲横流、道德沦丧、疯狂掠夺的资本主义社会的吹火筒而外，还能起什么作用呢？其结果，恐怕非但不能走向天国，而只能堕入人间罪恶的深渊。
