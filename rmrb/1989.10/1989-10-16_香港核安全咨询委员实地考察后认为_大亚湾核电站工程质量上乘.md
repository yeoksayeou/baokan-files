The third meeting of the Nuclear Safety Consultative Committee for the Dayawan Nuclear Power Station in Guangdong was held as scheduled yesterday at the construction site. Ten nuclear safety consultants from Hong Kong listened to a detailed report on the progress of the power station's construction provided by the nuclear power joint venture company and toured the construction site, interacting with experts in the nuclear industry from both China and abroad.

The reporter learned that the construction of the Dayawan Nuclear Power Station is proceeding smoothly according to the overall schedule. In terms of design and equipment manufacturing, the execution of the three major contracts for the nuclear island, conventional island equipment supply, and engineering services is satisfactory. The manufacturing of equipment for the first nuclear island has been completed by 95%, and many key pieces of equipment are in the final stages of manufacturing or have already been shipped. In terms of civil engineering, the main body of the civil engineering work has been completed by more than 65% of the total work volume, and the installation of the first reactor has begun.

Chairman of the Nuclear Safety Consultative Committee and senior figure in Hong Kong's business community, Mr. Wong Po-sun, told the reporter that after understanding the situation from various aspects, the committee is very satisfied with the progress of the project. Mr. Ho Chung-tai, a professional from Hong Kong and vice-chairman of the Nuclear Safety Consultative Committee, commented: "The impression of the nuclear power station's construction site is good. The site is well-organized, and the level of concrete pouring and steel frame erection in civil engineering is high." He said, "It is challenging to have more than 10,000 people working simultaneously and following the progress schedule, but they have achieved it."

Safety remains a topic of concern for everyone. At the press conference, a reporter asked the head of the quality assurance department of the joint venture company, Mr. Greenville, "How does the construction quality of the Dayawan Nuclear Power Station measure up to international standards?" This American nuclear power expert replied: "The construction quality of this nuclear power station in Guangdong is very good so far. The builders here place a high emphasis on quality and safety. I believe that once this nuclear power station is completed, it will be able to compete with any nuclear power station in the world."

    香港核安全咨询委员实地考察后认为
    大亚湾核电站工程质量上乘
    本报大亚湾10月15日电　记者黄幸群报道：广东大亚湾核电站的核安全咨询委员会第三次会议，如期于昨天在工地现场举行。来自香港的10位核安全咨委，听取了核电合营公司提供的电站工程建设进展的详细报告，并参观了施工现场，接触了中外核工业方面的专家。
    记者获悉，大亚湾核电站工程进度正很好地按总进度计划进行。在设计和设备制造方面，核岛、常规岛设备供应和工程服务三大合同执行情况良好。一号核岛的设备制造量已完成95％，好些主要设备已处在出厂阶段和制造后期。在土建工程方面，主体工程土建已完成总工作量的65％以上，一号反应堆已进入安装阶段。
    核安全咨询委员会主席、香港实业界的资深人士黄保欣向记者介绍，核安全咨委会了解了各方面的情况后，对工程的进展情况非常满意。香港专业人士、核安全咨询委员会副主席何忠泰先生的评价是：核电站施工现场给人的印象是良好的，地盘整理井然有序，土建混凝土浇灌、钢架架设水平都很高。他说，1万多人同时作业，要按照总计划的进度表实施，是困难的，但他们做到了。
    安全问题，仍然是大家关注的话题。在记者招待会上，有记者请合营公司质量保证部的负责人格林维尔回答：“按照国际标准衡量，大亚湾核电站目前建设质量水平到底怎样？”这位来自美国的核电专家说：在广东建设的这个核电站，到目前为止，工程质量是很好的。这里的建设者们很重质量、重安全。相信这里的核电站建好后，将可与世界上任何一个核电站媲美。
