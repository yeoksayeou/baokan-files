Since last winter and this spring, a wave of "mulberry garden craze" has swept through the vast rural areas. Not only have the old sericulture areas along the coast seen a reversal of the decline, but new sericulture areas in northern Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Yunnan have also sprung up like mushrooms after rain.

According to statistics, in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shandong alone, the net increase in mulberry garden area is 333,000 mu, an increase of more than 1.5 times over the same period last year. The increase in mulberry garden area in other provinces is at least 120,000 mu. Experts predict that in the next two to three years, the production of fresh cocoons can increase by at least 100,000 piculs compared to now. In other words, by 1991, cocoon production can reach more than 9.3 million piculs, and the procurement volume can reach 8.37 million piculs. The current shortage of raw materials caused by excess reeling capacity will gradually be filled, and there will be a significant surplus.

This is a piece of news that is both joyful and worrisome.

The imbalance of cocoon supply and demand in previous years may be replaced by an imbalance of oversupply.

Firstly, the global market capacity is limited, and competition is fierce. The prospects for excess cocoons are not optimistic. Currently, China's silk industry has a unique position in the international market. The production of cocoons and silk accounts for about 70% of the world's total production. The export volume of raw silk accounts for about 90% of the world's trade volume, and the export volume of silk fabrics accounts for about 45% of the world's trade volume. However, it must be noted that in recent years, the strong international demand and the doubling of silk prices have stimulated other countries' resolve to "share a piece of the pie." Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Brazil, Sri Lanka, and other countries are developing sericulture. Italy, South Korea, and other countries and regions also want to revive their old industries. At the same time, various countries are competing to develop synthetic silk substitute products. The emergence of new markets will inevitably impact the traditional international silk market. The increase in competing countries and the shrinkage of the market will pose a serious threat to China's sericulture industry.

Looking at the domestic situation: During the rectification and adjustment, the excessive development of reeling factories has been curbed; many local reeling factories have been closed and converted. The development speed of silk processing capacity has slowed down, while the development speed of cocoons has accelerated, which may cause the demand for raw materials in the reeling industry to shift from "hungry" to "saturated."

In addition, after the expansion of mulberry garden area, the supply of high-quality cocoon seeds, the supply of fertilizers, and the competition for land between mulberry and grain may all become prominent issues. If these issues are not properly addressed, not only will the enthusiasm of sericulturists be dampened, leading to a new round of mulberry tree cutting, but it will also lay the groundwork for a reduction in grain production.

To minimize the potential imbalance and to prevent the silk industry from repeating the historical cycle of "big ups and downs," the following work should be done from now on:

1. The area of mulberry gardens should not be increased further, the quality of cocoons must be improved, and the sericulture industry should compete with quality rather than quantity. China's silk industry is a typical export-oriented industry. In terms of industrial orientation, it must take the demand of the international market as the guiding principle. Today's international consumers are more focused on high-quality, high-grade silk products. The Western European market has always only accepted "3A grade" high-grade silk. The recent "cocoon wars" in China have affected the quality of cocoons, which must be noted.

Currently, the silk yield rate of our cocoons is only about 50% of Japan's. Even if the area of mulberry gardens does not expand, simply improving the quality and yield of cocoons can increase the production of raw silk by 20 to 40%.

2. Develop "vertical agriculture" in mulberry gardens, improve the comprehensive utilization of mulberry and silkworms, and increase the comprehensive income of sericulturists. This will help consolidate sericulture production. Except for tobacco, mulberry land can be intercropped with various grasses and legumes, fully utilizing the land's fertility and expanding the source of fertilizer. The entire mulberry tree, from root to tip, can be used as medicine. A bottle of about 200 milliliters of mulberry juice, priced at $2.5 by foreigners, can be used to make beverages and a series of nutrient-added foods. The successful transplantation of mulberry leaves can be imagined to make sericulture factory-based. Reeling by-products are an important source of chemical raw materials, silkworm pupae protein can be eaten, and amino acid recovery can be made into high-grade cosmetics.

3. Silk products must increase in variety and upgrade. China's clothing and other finished products only account for 33% of the total silk exports, with great potential. Under the current level of processing technology, it is more beneficial for China to export more raw silk and semi-finished products, but in the long run, to make silk products stand firm in the world market filled with strong competitors, it is necessary to accept the severe challenge of the modernization of the silk industry and bravely participate in the world competition in deep processing. If the silk industry does not break through in product structure, it will not be able to get rid of its passive position in the world market.

4. Silk trade must also open up new markets. Recently, silk consumers in developed countries are expanding from high-income groups to middle-income groups, and the upper and middle classes in some developing countries are also showing increasing interest in silk. China should actively use various favorable conditions and advantages, closely monitor the impact of the multipolar development of the world economic pattern, and on the premise of maintaining and consolidating the already formed trade position, it is possible and necessary to open up new markets.

### “桑园热”意味什么？

　　“桑园热”意味什么？
　　鲜述骅
    去冬今春以来，广大农村掀起了一股“桑园热”。不但沿海老蚕区桑蚕业止跌回升，而且苏北、河南、湖北、湖南、四川、云南等新蚕区也如雨后春笋般发展起来。
    据统计，仅江、浙、皖、鲁四省，就净增桑园面积33.3万亩，增幅为去年同期的1倍半以上。其他省份桑园增量至少也在12万亩之数。专家预测，今后两三年内，鲜茧产量比现今至少可增百万担上下。就是说，到1991年，茧产量可达930万担以上，收购量可达837万担。目前因缫丝能力过剩所造成的原料缺口将被逐渐填平，并将有较大的剩余。
    这是一则喜中有忧的信息。
    前几年蚕茧供不应求的失衡，将有可能被供过于求的失衡所替代。
    首先，世界市场容量有限，竞争激烈，过剩蚕茧出路不容乐观。目前看，我国丝绸业在国际上的地位非同一般。桑蚕茧和桑蚕丝的产量均占世界总产量的70％左右，生丝出口量约占世界贸易量的90％，绸缎出口量约占世界贸易量的45％。但是必须看到，近几年来，国际需求旺盛，丝绸价格倍增，刺激了他国“分一杯羹”的决心。孟加拉、巴基斯坦、印度、巴西、斯里兰卡都在发展桑蚕业，意大利、南朝鲜等国家和地区也想重振旧业。同时，各国竞相开发仿真丝替代产品，新市场的出现势必对传统的国际丝绸市场造成冲击。竞争国的增多与市场的萎缩交相出现，使我国的桑蚕业面临严重的威胁。
    再看国内情况：在治理、整顿当中，缫丝厂的超速发展得到遏止；不少地区的乡镇缫丝厂已经关停并转。丝绸加工能力的发展速度趋缓，而蚕茧的发展速度加快，很可能使缫丝工业的原料需求由“饥渴”转向“饱胀”。
    此外，桑园面积扩大以后，优质茧种的供应问题，化肥的供应问题，桑粮争地的问题，都有可能突出。如果解决不好，不但打击蚕农的生产积极性，造成新一轮的砍桑毁树，而且为粮食减产埋下隐患。
    为了把可能出现的失衡降到最低限度，也为了茧丝绸行业不重蹈“大上大下”的历史覆辙，从现在起，似应做好以下几项工作：
    一、桑园面积不可再增，蚕茧质量必须提高，桑蚕业要以质取胜而不能以量取胜。我国的丝绸业，是以出口为主的典型的外向型产业。在产业定向上，必须以国际市场的需求为宗旨。当今的国际消费者，其目光更多地倾注于高质量、高档次的丝绸制成品上。西欧市场历来只接受
  “3A级”的高等级丝。国内近年的“蚕茧大战”已影响了蚕茧质量，对此必须注意。
      目前，我蚕茧出丝率仅及日本的50％。即使桑园面积不扩大，单是提高茧质和单产，就可使生丝产量增加二至四成。
    二、发展桑园“立体农业化”，提高桑蚕的综合利用程度，增加蚕农的综合收益，如此才能巩固桑蚕生产。除烟草外，桑地可间作多种禾本科和豆科作物，一方面充分利用地力，一方面扩大肥源。桑树从根至梢均可入药。一瓶约200毫升桑椹原汁，外商出价2.5美元，可制饮料及系列添加营养食品。蚕草的移植成功，可设想使养蚕工厂化。缫丝副产品是重要的化工原料来源，蚕蛹蛋白可食用，氨基酸回收可制成高级美容化妆品。
    三、丝绸制成品必须增加品种，换档升级。我国服装及其他制成品只占丝绸出口总额的33％，潜力很大。在目前加工技术水平下，更多地出口厂丝原料和半成品于我国有利，但从长远看，欲使丝绸产品立足于强手如林的世界市场，就必须接受丝绸工业现代化的严峻挑战，在深加工方面勇敢地参与世界竞争。我国丝绸行业如不从产品结构上有所突破，在世界市场中就摆脱不了被动的地位。
    四、丝绸贸易还须开拓新的市场。最近，发达国家丝绸消费者正在从高薪层向中薪层扩展，而一些次发达国家的上、中层人士对丝绸的兴趣也越来越浓厚。我国积极地利用各种有利条件和优势，密切注意世界经济格局多极化发展所带来的影响，在保持巩固业已形成的贸易地位的前提下，有可能也有必要开辟新的市场。
