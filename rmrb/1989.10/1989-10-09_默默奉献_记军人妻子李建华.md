Title: Silent Dedication – A Record of the Wife of a Soldier, Li Jianhua

On August 16 of this year, she, as the sole representative of military wives in Beijing, attended the "Awarding Medals to Excellent Wives of Border and Coastal Defense Soldiers" conference, jointly held by the General Political Department, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the All-China Women's Federation, and other units. She was awarded the honorable title of "Excellent Wife of Border and Coastal Defense Soldiers." She is Li Jianhua, the head of the Propaganda Department of the Anhuali Subdistrict Office of Chaoyang District.

Li Jianhua is 35 years old. In 1979, she married Jin Ming, the political instructor of a certain company in the People's Liberation Army. After their marriage, she has always lived in the top floor of a simple building on Heping Street. The small room of about ten square meters is like a steamer in the summer and an ice cellar in the winter. To say nothing else, just the task of buying coal—even a strong young man would hesitate, let alone a weak woman, whose hardship can be imagined.

Kind-hearted people often tell her, "Jin Ming has been in the army for many years. Why not just have him apply for a transfer back to Beijing?"

She has had such thoughts too! Seeing the "coal mud" formed by the rain, she feels sad; holding her sick child, she feels wronged. But she always uses reason to control her emotions. Without her own hard work at home, how can her husband concentrate on guarding the border? Without soldiers concentrating on guarding the border, how can our country's borders have peace? This reasoning is simple, practical, and more importantly, noble and selfless. "Whether Jin Ming transfers or not can only be decided by the unit. Soldiers and their wives cannot make excessive demands on the organization!" This is how she responds to kind-hearted people.

She says this and does this. In 1980, Jin Ming had the idea of leaving the unit and transferring back for a while. After knowing this, she persuaded her husband to prioritize the construction of the unit and not to apply to the organization for a transfer. That August, when the child was about to be born, she voluntarily wrote a letter to her husband, saying that the unit's work was too busy, so he shouldn't come back. In 1985, an unexpected car accident damaged her bicycle, and she was also injured, but this matter was kept secret for several years...

During the interview, I looked through some of the letters they exchanged over the past decade or so. Among them, there were some expressions of young couples' longing for each other, but more were about helping each other with studies and supporting each other in work. They said: True love is not born in flowers and moonlight, in sweet nothings, but in the common struggle for a cause.

### 默默奉献——记军人妻子李建华

    默默奉献
    ——记军人妻子李建华
    今年8月16日，她作为北京市军人妻子的唯一代表，参加了总政治部、民政部、全国妇联等单位联合召开的“为边海防军人的优秀妻子挂奖章”大会，获得“边海防军人优秀妻子”的光荣称号。她，就是朝阳区安华里街道办事处党委宣传部部长李建华。
    李建华今年35岁。1979年她和解放军某连指导员靳明结为伉俪。婚后，她一直住在和平街一座简易楼的最上层，10多平方米的小屋子，夏天热得像蒸笼，冬天冷得似冰窖。别的不说，就光说买煤这一活计，棒小伙子尚且发怵，一个体弱的女子，其劳累可想而知。
    好心的人也常对她说：“靳明入伍年头不短了，干脆让他申请转业回北京算了。”
    她何尝没有这种念头！看着雨浇成的“煤泥”，她伤心；抱着生病的孩子，她委曲。可她总能用理智约束自己的情感。没有自己辛苦持家，丈夫怎能安心戍边？没有军人安心戍边，祖国边疆哪有安宁之日？这推理是简洁的，是实在的，更是高尚无私的。“靳明转不转业，只能由部队决定，军人和军人的妻子，不能向组织上提过份的要求！”她这样回答好心的人们。
    她这样说，也这样做。1980年，靳明一度产生离队转业的想法，她知道后，劝丈夫以部队建设为重，切不可自己向组织申请转业。这年8月，孩子临产，她主动给丈夫写信，部队工作太忙，就不要回来。1985年，一次意外的车祸把她的自行车轧坏，自己也受了伤，但这事一直瞒了好几年……
    采访中，我翻看了两人十几年来的部分信件，其中不乏年轻夫妻思念眷恋，但更多的是学习上的帮助，工作上的支持。他们说：真正的爱情不是产生在花前月下，卿卿我我之中，而是产生在为事业的共同奋斗中。　郭学棣
