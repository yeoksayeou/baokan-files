Title: The Wheat Field and the Thin Clouds

The wheat field ripples into a sea of green,
Songs blend into the earth's breath,
Without embellishment or accompaniment,
You can feel the genuine and ripening maturity.
When your gaze follows
The poetic wheat tips,
And lingers,
A thin cloud descends unexpectedly.
That, too, is a gaze and a meaning,
And it has been cleansed by billions of years.
It is an extraordinary simplicity born of splendor,
Silently caressing your weathered back,
Silently nourishing your vitality,
Silently blessing your hopes.
And when the wind blows,
Everything returns to its original state.
In your ears,
There is the gentle flow of irrigation water,
And a melody beating with your heartbeat.

专栏：

    麦田与薄云
    流逸
    麦田漾成碧绿的海
    歌声融进氤氲的地气
    省略了装饰和伴奏
    你可以切近地感受
    真实和灌浆的成熟
    当目光沿着
    诗意盎然的麦梢
    久久滑行
    便有不期而至的薄云俯临
    那也是一种目光和含义
    且受过亿万年的洗礼
    是绚烂之极的特殊平淡
    默默地抚着黧黑的背脊
    默默地浸润你的生机
    默默地祝福你的希望
    而当风吹动
    一切复归如初
    你耳边
    正有潺潺的渠水流着
    正有伴着心律的乐曲唱着
