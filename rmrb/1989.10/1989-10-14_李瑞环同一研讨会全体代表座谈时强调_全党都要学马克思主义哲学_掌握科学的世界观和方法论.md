Li Ruihuan, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and a secretary of the Secretariat, emphasized the need for the entire Party to study Marxist philosophy during a symposium with all representatives attending the National Symposium on Marxist Philosophy Research and Cadres' Philosophical Education. He stressed that studying Marxist philosophy is crucial for the Party to consolidate and adhere to the Marxist thought line of seeking truth from facts, as established by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and to better lead the people in building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The symposium was attended by Ding Guangen, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and a secretary of the Secretariat, and relevant officials from the Central Committee, including Wang Renzhi, Gao Di, Zhu Muzhi, and Zhou Kexiu.

In his speech, Li Ruihuan pointed out that recently, the Party Central Committee has emphasized the need to study Marxist philosophy. Several senior revolutionaries have repeatedly urged everyone to study philosophy. Comrade Jiang Zemin also stressed in his National Day speech that Party members, especially senior cadres, should study philosophy. Learning philosophy and mastering a scientific worldview and methodology is essential for completing various tasks at present. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the overall situation has been developing towards further stability. However, we must be prepared for the numerous problems and difficulties that lie ahead in our continued progress. Correctly addressing issues such as rectifying the confusion caused by bourgeois liberalization, stabilizing public sentiment, implementing tangible measures for the people, and effectively carrying out economic rectification while maintaining the momentum of reform and opening up, all require the use of Marxist philosophy as a powerful tool of cognition. Only by adhering to seeking truth from facts and rejecting subjectivism and one-sidedness can these issues be resolved correctly and effectively. Otherwise, we may fall from one extreme to another.

When discussing the need to calmly summarize the past and think about the future, Li Ruihuan emphasized that the significance of theory lies in its ability to scientifically foresee the future. We must seriously summarize the rich experiences and lessons accumulated over the past decade, avoid making mistakes, and transform these experiences into the people's spiritual wealth. We should neither avoid mentioning mistakes due to the significant achievements of the past decade nor deny the achievements while exposing the mistakes. When affirming, protecting, and nurturing new things, we should not forget to remove the remnants of old things attached to them. When making decisive choices, we should consider the long-term and overall impact. In summary, with the guidance of dialectical and historical materialism, we can continue to advance along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Li Ruihuan also pointed out that studying philosophy helps in deeply opposing bourgeois liberalization. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's mistakes in the issue of bourgeois liberalization were, from an epistemological perspective, a result of subjectivism detached from objective reality, which is contrary to the thought line of seeking truth from facts. Last autumn, despite the obvious signs of inflation, he insisted on pushing forward with price reforms; despite the significant weakening of ideological and political work in enterprises, he advocated for "reforms"; despite the widespread outrage among the people over corruption such as "official profiteering," he advocated for the "equal" rights of officials' children in business, and so on. These erroneous proposals, detached from reality, naturally faced resistance and opposition from the broad masses of cadres and the people. This incident from the opposite side tells us the extreme importance of studying philosophy.

Li Ruihuan said that strengthening Marxist philosophical education is a strategic measure to improve the overall quality of the cadre team. Adhering to Marxism is one of the four cardinal principles. In recent years, our Party has implemented the "four modernizations" policy, and a large number of young cadres have taken up leadership positions at various levels. A shallow foundation in Marxist philosophy is one of the reasons why some comrades have made slow progress and achieved mediocre results. It must be affirmed that professional knowledge is very important, but for a cadre responsible for overall leadership, due to changes in the objects, scope, and conditions of work, the original professional knowledge must be generalized philosophically, elevating the particular to the general. Only in this way can we prevent and overcome dogmatism and narrow empiricism, continuously enhance the principles, systematicness, foresight, and creativity in our work, and improve our leadership level. Party schools at all levels should make philosophy a compulsory course, greatly improve teaching content and methods, and strictly assess the learning achievements of the students. Marxist theoretical education should become a standard for evaluating cadres' revolutionary nature.

When discussing why philosophy should be emphasized at present, Li Ruihuan also pointed out that historical experience has proven that the improvement of the Party's philosophical level can greatly promote the vigorous development of the Party's cause. In the history of our Party, there have been two major learning activities of Marxist philosophy that have had a significant positive impact. One occurred during the Rectification Movement in Yan'an before the founding of the People's Republic, when high-level cadres and the broad masses of Party members, in connection with the experiences and lessons of the two domestic revolutionary wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan, seriously studied Mao Zedong's philosophical works, and gently reflected on themselves, greatly improving the Party's cognitive ability, thus laying the ideological foundation for winning the democratic revolution nationwide. A group of high-level cadres formed the good habit of studying and using philosophy from that time on. The other occurred during the period from the beginning of the "Truth Criterion Debate" in 1978 to the comprehensive reform, which was essentially a re-education of Marxist epistemology throughout the Party. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the core of the second-generation leadership collective of our Party, delivered a series of important speeches before and after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, which were full of materialism and dialectics, criticizing idealism and metaphysics, and giving the Party members a vivid education on the Marxist thought line of seeking truth from facts, combining theory with practice, and everything from reality. Without the "Truth Criterion Debate" and the improvement of the Party's Marxist philosophical level, there would not have been the victory of rectifying the wrongs and restoring the rights, nor would there have been the new situation of reform and opening up today.

Comrade Li Ruihuan pointed out that the study of Marxist theory should first focus on philosophy, and the study of philosophy should focus on the philosophical works of Comrade Mao Zedong and the works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and other senior revolutionaries that contain rich philosophical thoughts. This is not only because these works are easy to understand and their historical background is familiar to us, but more importantly, they are themselves brilliant gems in the treasure house of Marxist philosophy. In particular, Comrade Mao Zedong's military works provide us with the most brilliant examples of applying and developing Marxist epistemology and dialectics in practice, and we should pay more attention to them.

Li Ruihuan said that the study of philosophy should insist on combining theory with practice and rectifying the style of study. Combining theory with practice has many advantages: it is easier to understand and remember, the conflict between work and study is easier to resolve, and it is easier to persist for a long time. Combining theory with practice does not mean not reading books; on the contrary, one must work hard to read books. One should cultivate the habit of constantly summarizing work experience, giving philosophical significance to the summary of experience, and turning the process of discussing work gains and losses into a process of learning, applying, and researching philosophy. This process is a laborious mental labor process that cannot be delegated to others.

Li Ruihuan finally said that we should strive to create the necessary conditions for studying philosophy. For example, according to the requirements of readers at different levels, we should plan to publish a batch of philosophy books; carefully do a good job in guiding and exchanging philosophical insights; newspapers, television, radio, and other news media should pay attention to and do a good job in popularizing philosophy. Philosophical workers should naturally make more contributions to this.

At today's symposium, Sun Kexin, deputy researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Chen Xianda, professor at the Department of Philosophy of Renmin University of China, Liu Rong, professor at the Department of Philosophy of Sun Yat-sen University, Li Mingsheng, deputy researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Gu Erxiong, secretary of the CPC Qinhuangdao Municipal Committee, Shen Chong, professor at the Advanced Study Department of the Central Party School, and Sun Zhiguan, deputy professor at the Lecturer Team of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, spoke successively. They believed that in the nationwide cadre ranks, it is necessary to advocate for further study of Marxism-Leninism theory, especially philosophy, to clarify the right and wrong in the philosophical circle, to adhere to the style of combining theory with practice, and to make philosophy better serve China's socialist modernization construction.

This symposium began on October 11 and was jointly initiated and convened by the Marxist Philosophy History Society, the Mao Zedong Philosophical Thought Research Society, and the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee's Cadre Theoretical Education Lecturer Team.

    李瑞环同一研讨会全体代表座谈时强调
    全党都要学马克思主义哲学
    掌握科学的世界观和方法论
    新华社北京10月13日电　（新华社记者孙本尧、中央人民广播电台记者刘振英）中共中央政治局常委、书记处书记李瑞环今天在同出席全国马克思主义哲学研究与干部哲学教育研讨会全体代表座谈时强调指出，全党都要认真学习马克思主义哲学。学习马克思主义哲学，对于我们党巩固和坚持十一届三中全会进一步确立的实事求是的马克思主义思想路线，更好地领导全国人民建设有中国特色的社会主义，具有特别重大的作用和意义。
    中央政治局候补委员、书记处书记丁关根，中央有关部门负责人王忍之、高狄、朱穆之、周克玉等出席了今天的座谈会。
    李瑞环在讲话中指出，最近一个时期，党中央要求认真学习马克思主义哲学。几位老一辈革命家语重心长地叮嘱大家要认真学点哲学。江泽民同志的国庆讲话也强调全党同志首先是党的高级干部要学哲学。学习哲学，掌握科学的世界观和方法论，这是全面完成当前各项任务的需要。十三届四中全会以后，整个形势正朝着进一步稳定的方向发展。但是，对我们继续前进所要解决的问题之多、困难之大，也要有足够的思想准备。把被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的思想理论纠正过来，把群众的思想情绪真正理顺，把为人民办几件满意的事落到实处，认真搞好经济领域的治理整顿，实行紧缩的方针又不影响改革开放的势头，等等，这些问题的正确解决，都需要借助马克思主义哲学这个伟大的认识工具。坚持实事求是，反对主观片面，才能使它们得到正确有效的解决。否则，就有可能从一个片面走向另一个片面。
    在谈到要冷静地总结过去、思考未来时，李瑞环指出，理论的重大意义在于它可以科学地预见未来。我们一定要认真总结近十年来积累的极为丰富的经验和教训，不吃糊涂亏，不占糊涂便宜，把经验化为人民的精神财富。既不因十年成绩巨大而忌言失误，也不因揭露失误而否定成绩；在肯定、保护、扶植新生事物幼芽时，不忘记去掉附着在它身上的旧事物残片；在果断处理两难选择的问题时，要瞻前顾后，努力使之对全局和长远产生有利的影响。总之，有了辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的指导，我们就能继续沿着有中国特色的社会主义道路前进。
    李瑞环在谈到学习哲学有助于深入反对资产阶级自由化时指出，赵紫阳同志之所以在资产阶级自由化问题上犯错误，从认识论上来说，就是主观脱离客观，也就是脱离国情，违背了实事求是的思想路线。去年秋天，明明出现了明显的通货膨胀，还硬要大步推进物价改革；明明企业思想政治工作已经受到很大削弱，还要搞什么“改造”；明明“官倒”等腐败现象已经引起了广大群众的极大愤慨，还讲什么干部子弟在经商问题上应享受“平等”的权利，等等。这些脱离实际的错误主张，理所当然地遭到广大干部、群众的抵制和反对。这从反面告诉我们学哲学的极端重要性。
    李瑞环说，加强马克思主义哲学修养，是提高整个干部队伍素质的一项战略性措施。坚持马克思主义是四项基本原则的内容之一。这几年来，我们党实行干部“四化”的方针，有一大批年轻干部走上了各级领导岗位。马克思主义哲学功底浅，这是一些同志进步不快、成绩平平的一个原因。应当肯定，懂得专业知识是非常重要的，但对于一个担负全面领导责任的干部来说，由于工作的对象、范围、条件起了变化，原有的专业知识必须进行哲学的概括，把个别上升到一般。只有这样，才能防止和克服教条主义和狭隘经验主义，不断增强工作中的原则性、系统性、预见性和创造性，提高领导水平。各级党校要把哲学列入必修课，大力改进教学内容和方法，并对学员的学习成绩加以严格考核。马克思主义理论修养要成为考核干部革命化的一个标准。
    在讲到当前为什么要强调学习哲学时，李瑞环还指出，历史经验证明，全党哲学水平的提高能够极大地推动党的事业的蓬勃发展。在我们党的历史上，曾有过两次产生了巨大积极影响的学习马克思主义哲学活动。一次发生在建国前的延安整风时期，全党的高级干部和广大党员，联系两次国内革命战争和抗日战争的经验教训，认真学习毛泽东哲学著作，和风细雨地反思自己，使全党的认识能力有了很大的提高，从而为在全国范围内夺取民主革命的胜利奠定了思想基础。一批高级干部从那时起养成了学哲学、用哲学的良好习惯。另一次发生在以1978年真理标准讨论为开端的拨乱反正到全面改革的时期。真理标准问题是哲学问题，所以这次大讨论实质上是一次全党范围的马克思主义认识论的再教育。邓小平同志是我们党的第二代领导集体的核心。他在十一届三中全会前后发表的一系列重要讲话，充满唯物论和辩证法，批判了唯心论和形而上学，使全党同志受到了生动的实事求是、理论联系实际、一切从实际出发的马克思主义思想路线的教育。没有真理标准的大讨论，没有全党马克思主义哲学水平的提高，也就不会有拨乱反正的胜利，更不会有今天改革开放的新局面。
    李瑞环同志指出，学习马克思主义理论首先要学好哲学，而学习哲学应重点学好毛泽东同志的哲学著作，学好邓小平同志等老一辈革命家包含着丰富哲学思想的著作。这不仅因为这些著作通俗易懂，它所产生的历史背景我们比较熟悉，更重要的它本身也是马克思主义哲学宝库中的灿烂明珠。特别是毛泽东同志的军事著作，为我们提供了在实践中运用和发展马克思主义认识论和辩证法的最光辉的范例，我们更应当加以重视。
    李瑞环说，学哲学要坚持理论联系实际，端正学风。联系实际学好处很多：容易学懂，容易记住，工作和学习的矛盾容易解决，也便于长期坚持下去。联系实际学，不是不看书，相反要下功夫看书。要养成不断总结工作经验的习惯，赋予总结经验以哲学的意义，把探讨工作得失的过程变成学习、运用、研究哲学的过程。这个过程是不能假手别人的艰苦脑力劳动的过程。
    李瑞环最后说，要努力为学习哲学创造必要的条件。例如，要根据不同层次读者的要求，有计划地出一批哲学书籍；精心做好学哲学的辅导和心得交流；报刊、电视、广播等新闻媒介都要重视和做好普及哲学的工作。哲学工作者要理所当然地为此多做贡献。
  在今天的座谈会上，中国社科院哲学所副研究员孙克信、中国人民大学哲学系教授陈先达、中山大学哲学系教授刘嵘、中国社科院哲学所副研究员李敏生、中共秦皇岛市委书记顾二熊、中央党校进修部教授沈冲、河北省委讲师团副教授孙仲管等先后发了言。他们认为，在全国干部中要提倡进一步学习马列主义理论特别是哲学，澄清哲学界的是非，坚持理论联系实际的学风，使哲学更好地为我国的社会主义现代化建设服务。
    这次研讨会于10月11日开始，是由马克思主义哲学史学会、毛泽东哲学思想研究会、中共北京市委干部理论教育讲师团联合发起召开的。
