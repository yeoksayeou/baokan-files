Today, from the jungles of South America to the streets of North American cities, a fierce anti-drug campaign is underway.

Drug abuse and trafficking are a major global scourge. It is estimated that the annual turnover of the global drug trade is approximately $300 billion. The scale of drug trafficking is comparable to the oil trade. One of the drugs currently prevalent in the international market is cocaine. The main producers of cocaine are the three South American countries of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Colombia produces 15% of the world's coca leaves, the raw material for refining cocaine, while Peru accounts for 50% of the global production. Medellín, Colombia's second-largest city, has become the international hub for drug trafficking and is known as the underground "capital" of cocaine. It is home to a large number of "cocaine barons," who are billionaires with hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in wealth. They control 10% of the country's land, forming a massive cartel that monopolizes the production and sale of cocaine. They use coca leaves produced domestically and smuggled from Peru and Bolivia to produce approximately 400 tons of cocaine annually, worth nearly $50 billion. They have established a vast underground sales network in the United States, smuggling 80% of the cocaine into the U.S. market. These cocaine trafficking groups have thousands of private armies, whose weapons and equipment are more advanced than those of the local military and police.

Drugs are the root cause of Colombia's long-term turmoil. The country sees 15,000 murders annually, averaging 41 per day. Most of these murders are drug-related. Over the past decade, the Medellín cocaine trafficking group has killed thousands of officials, including two ministers and 12 Supreme Court judges. To legalize their trafficking activities, the drug lords have long demanded dialogue with the government and attempted to bribe government officials. In 1985, they offered to pay off the government's $14 billion foreign debt in exchange for amnesty for their crimes. After their unreasonable demands were rejected, they resorted to more violent retaliation. On August 18 of this year, the presidential candidate of the ruling Liberal Party, Galán, was assassinated. This bloody act sparked widespread outrage among the Colombian people. Under President Barco's leadership, they have fought relentlessly against the drug trafficking groups. President Barco called on all citizens to wage war against the drug lords, vowing to "eradicate this 'cancer' that threatens the nation's survival." The government mobilized 20,000 troops and police to launch a comprehensive offensive against the drug trafficking groups, dealing them a significant blow. In a three-day sweep, they raided 600 large estates and mansions belonging to the "cocaine barons," destroyed their cocaine production laboratories, seized 6 tons of cocaine, confiscated 143 aircraft, hundreds of vehicles and ships, and arrested tens of thousands of suspects. The Colombian government also froze the drug lords' bank deposits and reinstated the extradition agreement with the U.S. that had been suspended.

President Barco has pledged to wage a protracted war. A vigorous anti-drug campaign has begun in South America. Colombia's government and people have shown great determination and courage in their anti-drug struggle, winning widespread attention and sympathy from the international community.

Drug abuse is prevalent in the United States, with an estimated 20 million drug users. Many young men and women have turned to theft, robbery, murder, or prostitution due to drug addiction. Recently, in Detroit, a drug-addicted woman exchanged her 13-year-old daughter for drugs, allowing a drug dealer to rape her. Today, drug rehabilitation is a top concern for the American public. Every U.S. president has included anti-drug efforts in their policy agenda, spending billions of dollars annually on anti-drug campaigns. However, drug trafficking continues unabated and is becoming increasingly rampant.

On September 5, President Bush proposed a massive anti-drug plan in his first national television address. President Bush stated, "Drug abuse is the most serious threat facing our country today. Drugs have turned our cities into battlefields, slaughtering our children." Bush's anti-drug plan aims to allocate $7.9 billion in the current fiscal year for strengthening domestic law enforcement, drug education and treatment, and assisting South American countries in their anti-drug efforts. Previous U.S. presidents focused on preventing drugs from entering the country. Bush's plan differs in that it emphasizes tackling both ends: reducing domestic drug consumption and curbing foreign drug production. Bush's anti-drug goal is to reduce domestic drug consumption by 10% within two years and by 50% within a decade. President Bush's anti-drug plan has once again sounded the alarm for the anti-drug war in North America, announcing the opening of a second front in the anti-drug battle.

Recently, Colombian President Barco spoke to U.S. News & World Report, complaining about the insatiable demand for cocaine in the U.S. market. He pointed out that U.S. drug consumption has become a "fuel" for Colombia's violence. President Barco believes, "Only when people realize that cocaine is not just a problem for Colombia, but a problem for all concerned countries, will the anti-drug war have a chance of success."

This American woman has just participated in a 15-hour anti-drug march in Detroit. Her sign reads, "You are killing our future."

    泛美归毒战
    刘绪民
    今天，从南美的丛林到北美城市的街头正在进行着一场激烈的扫毒战。
    吸毒和贩毒是世界的一大公害。据估计，世界上每年的毒品交易额约3000亿美元。毒品交易的规模堪与石油贸易相比拟。国际市场上目前流行的毒品之一是可卡因。可卡因的主要产地是哥伦比亚、秘鲁和玻利维亚3个南美国家。哥伦比亚生产的提炼可卡因原料的古柯叶占世界总产量的15％，秘鲁的古柯叶产量占世界产量的50％。哥伦比亚第二大城市麦德林已成为国际贩毒活动中心，被称作世界可卡因的地下“首都”。那里聚居着大批“可卡因大王”。他们是拥有数百万美元甚至几亿美元财富的大富翁。他们掌握着这个国家10％的土地，组成了庞大的卡特尔，垄断着可卡因的生产和销售。他们利用本国生产的和从秘鲁、玻利维亚偷运进的古柯叶作原料，每年生产约400吨的可卡因，价值将近500亿美元。他们在美国建有庞大的地下销售网，将80％的可卡因贩入美国市场。这些可卡因贩毒集团拥有数以千计的私家军队，他们的武器装备比当地军队和警察的还先进。
    毒品是造成哥伦比亚长期动乱的根源，这个国家每年发生1.5万起谋杀案，平均每天41起。大部分谋杀案与毒品有关。近10年来，麦德林可卡因贩毒集团共杀害上千名官员，其中有两名部长、12名最高法院法官。贩毒集团为了使贩毒活动合法化，一直要求与政府对话，并对政府官员进行收买。1985年他们曾提出愿替政府偿还140亿美元的外债，以换取对他们罪行的赦免。他们的无理要求遭拒绝后，便采取更加疯狂的报复手段。今年8月18日执政的自由党总统候选人加兰被刺杀，这一血腥暴行激起哥伦比亚人民的极大愤慨。他们在巴尔科总统的领导下，前仆后继，与贩毒集团进行了斗争。巴尔科总统号召全体人民对贩毒集团开战，“坚决挖掉威胁民族生存的这一‘毒瘤’”。政府调动两万名军队和警察，向贩毒集团发起全面进攻，给贩毒集团以重大打击。在3天的大搜查中，包抄了“可卡因大王”的600个大牧场和官邸，捣毁了他们用以生产可卡因的实验室，没收6吨可卡因，缴获143架各种飞机、数百辆汽车和船只，逮捕上万名嫌疑分子。哥伦比亚政府还冻结了贩毒集团在银行的存款，宣布恢复一度中止过的哥、美引渡贩毒分子的协定。
    巴尔科总统提出要打一场持久战。一场轰轰烈烈的扫毒战在南美拉开了战幕。哥伦比亚政府和人民在反毒斗争中所表现的决心和勇敢赢得了国际社会的普遍关注和广泛同情。
    吸毒现象在美国相当普遍，据统计，美国吸毒者达2000多万人。许多男女青少年因吸毒而走上偷窃、抢劫、凶杀或沦为娼妓的犯罪道路。不久前底特律一名吸毒妇女，为了换取毒品，竟将自己13岁的亲生女儿交给一个毒品贩子任其强奸。如今，戒毒是美国公众最关心的问题。美国历届总统都把扫毒纳入施政纲领，每年都要耗费巨资用于扫毒，然而毒品却屡禁不止，贩毒活动日益猖獗。
    布什总统9月5日在他第一次全国电视演说中，提出一项庞大的扫毒计划。布什总统说：“毒品的滥用是美国当前国内所面临着的最严重的威胁。毒品把我们的城市变为战场，屠杀着我们的孩子。”布什的扫毒计划拟在本财政年度内动用79亿美元，用作加强国内法制建设、戒毒教育和治疗以及援助南美洲国家毒品生产国的扫毒战。过去美国历届总统的扫毒重点放在防止毒品入境上，布什的扫毒计划与以往不同的是，他强调抓两头：一方面设法减少美国国内的毒品消费；一方面致力减少国外的毒品生产。布什提出的扫毒目标是：两年之内使国内毒品消费减少10％，10年之内减少50％。布什总统的扫毒计划再次吹响了北美扫毒战的号角，宣布了在北美开辟了扫毒的第二战场。
    哥伦比亚总统巴尔科最近对美国《时代》周刊发表谈话，抱怨美国市场上对可卡因永不满足的需求。他指出，美国对毒品的消费已成为哥伦比亚暴力行为的一种“燃料”。巴尔科总统表示深信：“只有当人们认识到可卡因不仅仅是哥伦比亚的问题，而是属于一切有关国家的问题时，扫毒战才有可能取得胜利。”（附图片）
