A Cheng has been writing seriously for several years. When he was a laborer, when he drove a car, and even when he worked as an editor at *Novel Forest*, he wrote, he published, and even made it into *Selected Stories*. However, he didn't attract much attention. Careless readers like me even mistook his works for those of the famous author of *The Chess Master*, A Cheng (钟阿城). It was only after *Six Essays at the Year's End* was selected and won an award that people suddenly realized that "the young lady of the Yang family has grown up." The 42-year-old man, Wang A Cheng, has transformed into someone elegant and charming, making you look at him with new eyes.

A Cheng's novels have charm. The charm lies in his portrayal of human emotions. I just finished reading his *Dian Shabai*, a mere two thousand words, but it left me deeply moved and melancholic, lost in thought, unable to let go. A young boy, upon discovering a tombstone inscription of a deceased girl who was born in the same year as him, felt a deep connection and mourned her for the rest of his life. It sounds like a ghostly love story from *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*, but this Dian Shabai is indeed foolish. Yet, isn't it precisely because of this foolishness and this deep affection that people can communicate and bond—become human?

A Cheng's novels are never more than ten thousand words long, flowing and gentle, sad and desolate. The first reading makes your eyes wet, the second reading warms your heart. The deep love and affection that flows in the hearts of the underclass is not coquettish or crazy, but heart-wrenching and earth-shattering! It effortlessly transcends worldly ethical views, moral views, views of good and evil, and values, becoming the eternal guiding light in the cold and dark journey of life for the underclass.

It's not a single lamp. It's a river of lamps. It shines in A Cheng's series of works: *Empty Tomb* depicts the Three-Surname Village as a utopian paradise, where people who are hard to get along with in the real world surprisingly understand and treat each other kindly and beautifully; in *Golden Backbone*, the gold miners and their women, who are wild and fierce, have another side that is loyal and affectionate; in *Old Liang*, the "rightist" Old Liang, who is calm and indifferent to rise and fall, honor and disgrace, has a deep and enduring love for his lover from his youth, whom he was forced to separate from...

Sometimes, the energy that lights up this warm lamp is complex—in the elegant and rich *Six Essays at the Year's End*, from Grandpa and the wandering woman, Father and Mu Wan, we see human nature and true feelings. However, the veil of warmth and affection between the Wang family is obviously just the insincere "rituals" and "benevolence" of feudal ethics and morality, which are crumbling but still fragrant like autumn chrysanthemums!

Sometimes, the author intentionally hides the lamp, letting you face the harm and destruction of human nature, the distortion and alienation of personality. In the thick darkness, you feel the preciousness of the lamp even more clearly and yearn for its arrival even more anxiously.

Oh, this lamp illuminates A Cheng's works and warms the hearts of readers. Especially today, when the rust of copper is once again corroding people's souls and people have almost lost faith in this "classical" humanistic sentiment, isn't it even more precious?

A Cheng indeed has charm. The charm lies in his language. It is concise yet clear, accurate yet expressive, novel yet natural, elegant yet rustic, and rhythmically resonant with harmonious tones. A Cheng's language has three distinct features: imitation of the classics, colloquialism, and humor.

Many have tried to imitate the classics, but it's hard to get the timing right. The American John Galisho, who wrote *Twenty Lectures on Novel Writing*, while believing that "the simpler the language, the more refined the style," also emphasizes that "it is crucial for the written words to be clear and readable. Works that do not meet these conditions are hard to expect to be tolerated." This makes sense. After all, we live in today's world, not in ancient or modern times. After all, words are among living, breathing you, me, and them, not living in yellowed or unyellowed pages.

A Cheng seems to have better skills in integrating and harmonizing. While diving into the poetry, prose, and notes of the ancients, he also faces life and listens carefully to the true words and true language of real people. He lets the two complement each other, each enhancing the other. Imitating the classics makes him pay attention to word choice, active use of words, and short sentences.

Humor is A Cheng's reach towards tomorrow. It fully shows A Cheng's modern consciousness and modern aesthetic taste. Some people oppose defining A Cheng with "black humor," which is understandable because A Cheng does not have a pessimistic and despairing ideological tendency. However, it is still distinctly different from the traditional Chinese humor similar to comedy—it is "black" enough! The lamp of human emotions has not made A Cheng's language a bit warmer. On the contrary, he treats it indifferently and narrates it coldly, using indifference to write about affection. This narrative attitude of placing pain and laughter, cruelty and tenderness, absurd facts, and calm reactions that are disproportionately calm side by side is unique.

The charm of A Cheng's language also lies in its regional cultural color.

Harbin, although short in history, is a city with style. The culture of the Central Plains scholars and the culture of the northern minorities collide here. Russian, Japanese, Korean, and other foreign civilizations have also left their marks here. It is known that compared to Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, and other places, whether it is the cityscape or the humanities, Harbin is unique.

This is an opportunity. Because difference is characteristic, Harbin writers should have a lot to do.

However, except for Wang Nüzeng, who once showed her prowess with *Peace Under Heaven* and *The Lamp Palace*, currently only Wang A Cheng is diligently working to bear fruit: *Six Essays at the Year's End*, *The Prostitute*, *Cracked*, *Old Liang*... He has truly brought Harbin and its people to life!

The contemporary American novelist Herman Garlan believes that one should not "write with local color for the sake of local color," "tourists cannot write novels with local color," because only "sincerity" and "love" can naturally bring out the local color.

Yes. Many works full of black bears, foxes, birch bark boats, and rough dialects are like men with painted chest hair, and have not given us much warm feelings. While completely lacking these surface characteristics, A Cheng's works are loved by everyone, and people say they are "like" and have "flavor." This is probably because—

First, A Cheng is a native of Harbin.

Second, A Cheng loves his hometown sincerely.

    阿成和他的小说
    李福亮
    阿成正经写了好几年了。做小工时，开汽车时，直到在《小说林》当编辑时，都写，都发，也上《选刊》，却是没怎么惹眼。粗心读者有如我者，甚至“王”冠“钟”戴，把它们记到了写《棋王》名世的钟阿城的帐上。直到《年关六赋》入选中奖，人们才恍然发现，“杨家有女初长成”，42岁的汉子王阿成，摇身一变，已然顾盼多姿、齐楚动人，不由你不刮目相看了。
    阿成小说有魅力。魅力在人情。我刚放下他的《田傻子》，不过两千多字，竟搅得我愀愀然，戚戚然，怔怔地，一时放心不下。一个少年，于碑文上发现一亡女与自己“同庚”，“便觉得亲得很”，缠绵凭吊，伴其终生。听来像《聊斋》人鬼之恋，这田傻子也委实傻得可以了。可是，不正是由于多了这几分傻气、一缕痴情，人与人才得以沟通、得以凝聚——人才成为人了么？
    阿成小说最长不足万字，娓娓婉婉，凄凄凉凉，初看眼湿，再看心烫。那种流淌在相濡以沫的底层人心中的挚爱真情并不卿卿我我疯疯魔魔却又刻骨铭心惊天动地！它轻而易举地超越了世俗的伦理观道德观善恶观价值观，成为底层人阴冷漆黑的生命旅途中永远引领人心的灯火。
    不是孤灯。而是灯河。它亮在阿成的一系列作品之中：《空坟》中的三姓屯仿佛世外桃源，现世十分难处的各种人在那里竟互相体谅宽厚和美；《金脊梁》中淘金汉子和他们的女人野蛮慓悍争强斗狠的另一面是肝胆相照重义多情；《老梁》中的“右派分子”老梁沉浮不惊荣辱皆空的内心深处却是对早年被拆散的恋人的没齿不忘一往情深……
    有时，燃亮这温馨灯火的能源比较复杂——在潇洒自如蕴含丰富的《年关六赋》中，从爷爷和漂漂女、父亲和木婉身上，我们看到的当然是人的天性与真情，而笼罩在王氏家族之间的温情脉脉的幕纱却显然只是情不由衷的“礼”与“仁”，是分崩离析却又秋菊晚香的封建伦理道德！
    有时，作者有意把灯火隐去，让你直面人性的戕害与毁灭，人格的扭曲与异化，进而在一片浓黑中分外清楚地感到灯火的可贵，更加惶恐地渴盼灯火的到来。
    哦，这灯火，照亮了阿成的作品，熨贴了读者的心。特别在今天，铜锈再度吞噬人们的灵魂而人们对人道主义这准“古典”情愫几乎丧失信心的时刻，它不尤其显得弥足珍贵么？
    阿成确实有魅力。魅力在语言。它简约而晓畅，准确而写意，新奇又自然，典雅却朴拙，更兼节奏铿锵、音韵和谐。可以清楚地看出阿成语言的三个特点：一拟古，二从俗，三幽默。
    拟古好多人都试过，但火候很难掌握。写过《小说写作技巧二十讲》的美国人约翰·盖利肖在认为“语言越是简洁，风格就越是高妙”的同时又强调说：“至关重要的是写出来的话要明白可读。不符合这些条件的作品，就难以期望被容忍。”言之有理。我们毕竟生活在今天，而不是生活在古代或近代。毕竟话在有血有肉的你我他中间，而不是活在发黄或不发黄的书页里。
    阿成似乎兼收与融会的功夫好一些。在一头扎向诗词歌赋前人笔记的同时，他又面对生活支起耳朵认真撷取真人真话活人活语。他让二者采长补短，相得益彰。拟古，使他讲究炼字，词类活用，短句为主。
    幽默，是阿成伸向明天的触角。它充分显示了阿成的现代意识和现代审美情趣。有人反对用“黑色幽默”来认定阿成，当然不无道理，因为阿成并无悲观绝望的思想倾向；然而，它还是与我们中国传统的类似滑稽的幽默判然有别——它“黑”得可以了！人情的灯火并没使阿成的语言稍带暖意。相反，他淡然处之，漠然述之，以无情写有情。这种把痛苦与欢笑、残忍与柔情、荒谬的事实与平静得不相称的反应并列在一起的叙述态度，别具一格。
    阿成语言的魅力还在于地域文化色彩。
    哈尔滨历史虽短，却是一个有风格的城市。中原汉儒文化与北方少数民族文化在这里碰撞，俄罗斯、日本、朝鲜等域外文明也在这里各自留下了印迹。众所周知，与北京、上海、西安等地相比，无论是城市风貌，还是人文心理，哈尔滨全都卓荦不群。
    这是一个机会。因为，差别就是特色，哈尔滨市作家本该大有作为。
    然而，除了写过《天下太平》与《灯宫》的王娘曾经一露锋芒之外，眼下只有王阿成孜孜以求果满枝头：《年关六赋》、《良娼》、《龟裂》、《老梁》……真是写活了哈尔滨与哈尔滨人！
    美国当代小说家赫姆林·加兰认为不应当“为地方色彩而地方色彩”，“旅游者不能写出有地方色彩的小说”，因为只有“真诚”和“爱”才能把地方色彩自然而然地“捎带出来”。
    是的。不少满是黑瞎子、火狐狸、桦皮船和疙里疙瘩的土话的作品犹如画上胸毛的男子汉，并没有给我们传递多少亲切的感受，而完全找不见这些表面特征的阿成作品，人们却爱不释手，都说“像”，都说“有味儿”，这大概是因为——
    一，阿成是哈尔滨人，土生土长。
    二，阿成爱家乡，真诚地。
