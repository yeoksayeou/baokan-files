A new industry of refurbishing old bicycles has recently become increasingly popular in Zhengzhou. Many families used to discard their old bicycles, leaving them in the junk pile. However, after refurbishment, these bicycles are once again riding on the streets.

The reporter visited the Zhengzhou Bicycle Refurbishing Factory, which is the first of its kind in the country. There, bicycles that were 5 to 30 years old and originally covered in rust have been refurbished into vibrant colors: black, red, blue, white, and green.

    据新华社郑州10月29日电  （记者古文洪）一种将旧自行车翻新的新兴行业，近来在郑州市越来越受欢迎。原来被许多家庭扔在杂物堆里弃之不用的旧自行车，经过翻新后，又纷纷驶上了街头。
    记者在尚属全国首家的郑州自行车翻新厂看到，一些车龄在5至30年、本来锈迹斑斑的旧自行车，经过翻新后，黑、红、蓝、白、绿五彩缤纷。
