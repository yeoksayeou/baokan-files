In the first nine months of this year, despite the repeated joint interventions by central banks of Western countries, the dollar exchange rate has continued to rise. Since the beginning of the year, the dollar's exchange rate against the West German Mark has increased by more than 9%, and against the Japanese Yen by 12%. It is estimated that in the coming months, it may rise to new heights.

The dollar exchange rate reached its highest level in three months last month. On September 15th, the U.S. government announced that the trade deficit for July was lower than market expectations, providing new stimulus to the market. On that day, despite the joint intervention of central banks, the dollar exchange rate soared to 1 U.S. dollar for 2.0 West German Marks and 147 Japanese Yen, far exceeding the floating limit of 1 U.S. dollar for 1.7-1.9 Marks and 120-140 Yen set by the finance ministers of the Group of Seven.

The dollar exchange rate has been able to rise to its current level due to factors other than the high U.S. interest rates.

Many people had predicted a few months ago that the U.S. economy would experience a recession, but economic experts recently have made optimistic assessments of the U.S. economic situation, believing that the U.S. economy will achieve a "soft landing," maintaining low-speed growth under eased inflationary pressure and not immediately facing a recession.

The latest figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that the economic leading index rose by 0.3% in August, the highest increase since May. At the same time, the producer price index, which has been declining for several months, and the relatively stable consumer price index indicate that inflation is on its last legs and is unlikely to rise further. The low-speed economic growth and the easing of inflationary pressure, in turn, signal a stable U.S. monetary policy. This not only dispels the pessimistic sentiment about a near-term U.S. economic recession but also makes people believe that the Federal Reserve has the ability to achieve a "soft landing" for the U.S. economy through "fine-tuning." Most analysts believe that the high U.S. interest rates, market confidence in U.S. monetary policy, and the relatively good economic situation will keep the dollar exchange rate strong and may push it further up.

### 美元将继续坚挺

    美元将继续坚挺
    今年头九个月里，尽管西方各国中央银行不断联手干预，但美元汇价却依然不断上升，自年初以来，美元对西德马克的汇率上升了9％以上，对日元的汇率上升了12％。估计在今后几个月里可能上升到新的高度。
    美元汇价在上个月升到三个月来的最高水平。9月15日，美国政府公布的7月份贸易赤字低于市场预料，给市场带来新的刺激。当日尽管各中央银行协力干预，美元汇价却跃至1美元兑换2.0西德马克和147日元的水平，大大高出所传西方七国财长内定的1美元兑换1.7—1.9马克和120—140日元的浮动限度。
    美元汇率能够攀升到目前的水平，除美国利率高的因素外，还有其他经济因素。
    许多人前几个月曾预言美国经济将发生衰退，而经济界人士最近对美国经济形势作了乐观的估计，认为美国经济将实现“软着陆”，即在缓解的通货膨胀压力下保持低速增长，一时还不致于出现衰退。
    美国商务部公布的最新数字表明，8月份经济先行指数上升0.3％，升幅为5月以来之最。同时，几个月来呈下降趋势的生产者物价指数和比较稳定的消费物价指数也表明，通货膨胀已是强弩之末，不太可能进一步上升。经济低速增长和通货膨胀压力的减轻反过来则预示着美国货币政策的稳定。这不仅消除了人们担心近期美国经济出现衰退的悲观情绪，而且使人们相信，联邦储备委员会有能力通过“微调”使美国经济实现“软着陆”。大多数分析家认为，美国的高利率、外汇市场对美国货币政策的信心以及较好的经济形势等诸因素，将使美元汇价继续保持坚挺，很可能会推动它进一步上升。
