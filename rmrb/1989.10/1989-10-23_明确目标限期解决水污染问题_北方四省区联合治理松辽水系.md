	Clearly Define Goals and Set Deadlines to Solve Water Pollution Problems
	Four Northern Provinces and Regions Jointly Address the Songhua-Liaohe River System

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Changchun on October 21st, the meeting of the Songhua-Liaohe River System Protection Leading Group, which concluded today in Jilin City, proposed goals for further controlling water pollution in the Songhua-Liaohe River System over the next three years.

	Representatives from Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia, as well as officials from 12 ministries and commissions under the State Council and relevant experts, discussed the current state of pollution and the level of treatment in the Songhua-Liaohe River System. They proposed the following goals: controlling the water quality in the water source protection areas and in Songhua Lake, Jingpo Lake, and the Dapofang, Xinlicheng, and Shitoukoumen reservoirs to meet the national surface water quality standard of Class II; striving to control the water quality in the Songhua River System, the Daliao River, and certain severely polluted sections of the Liao River to meet the national surface water quality standard of Class III; reducing the industrial wastewater discharge per 10,000 yuan of industrial output value to between 200 and 300 tons for major cities and below 400 tons for general cities within three years; and achieving a sewage treatment rate of over 10% and a water reuse rate of over 60% for industrial use.

	The Songhua-Liaohe River System is the lifeline of the Northeast economic region. This area is a major grain-producing region and also a heavy industrial base in China. In recent years, with the development of industrial and agricultural production, the amount of pollutants discharged into the water has been increasing.

	Participants at the meeting, while affirming that setting deadlines for the treatment of water pollution sources is a successful experience, decided to take a path that combines centralized and decentralized treatment. Following the principle of treating upstream areas before downstream areas, they proposed requirements for cities such as Jilin, Harbin, and Shenyang, and for enterprises such as Jilin Chemical Company, Daqing Oilfield, and Anshan Iron and Steel Company. These requirements include reforming unreasonable processes, reducing water consumption quotas, and achieving the resource utilization of wastewater.

　　明确目标限期解决水污染问题
　　北方四省区联合治理松辽水系
    据新华社长春10月21日电  （新华社记者陈广俊、中国环境报记者马国瑞）今天在吉林市结束的松辽水系保护领导小组会议提出了今后3年内进一步治理松辽水系水源污染的目标，对水污染进行限期治理。
    来自吉林、辽宁、黑龙江、内蒙古四省区和国务院12个部委的负责同志及有关专家，结合松辽水系的污染现状和治理水平，提出的这些目标包括把水源保护区和松花湖、镜泊湖及大伙房、新立城、石头口门水库的水质控制在国家地面水二级标准；力争把松花江水系、大辽河及辽河部分污染严重的河段水质控制在地面水三级标准；3年内万元工业产值废水排放量，主要城市控制在200至300吨，一般城市控制在400吨以下；城市污水处理率要达到10％以上，工业用水重复率一般应达到60％以上等。
    松辽水系是东北经济区的命脉。这里是商品粮基地，同时又是我国重工业基地。近年随着工农业生产的发展，排放到水中的污染物也日益增加。
    参加这次会议的代表在肯定对水污染源实行限期治理是一条成功经验的同时，确定走集中和分散治理相结合的道路，并本着先上游后下游的原则，对吉林、哈尔滨、沈阳等城市诸如吉化公司、大庆油田、鞍山钢铁公司等企业提出了改革不合理工艺，降低耗水定额、实现污水资源化等要求。
