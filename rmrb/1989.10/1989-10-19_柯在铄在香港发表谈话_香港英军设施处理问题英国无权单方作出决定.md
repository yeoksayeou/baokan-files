Guo Zaizhu, the chief representative of the Chinese side in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, spoke to reporters from this news agency today regarding the handling of the HMS Tamar naval base and other current British military facilities in Hong Kong.

Guo Zaizhu said: "The handling of the HMS Tamar naval base and other current British military facilities in Hong Kong involves the arrangements for the People's Liberation Army to be stationed in Hong Kong after 1997. The two sides have discussed the relevant issues multiple times within the framework of the Joint Liaison Group, but so far, no consensus has been reached. The Chinese side has consistently adopted a cooperative attitude and seriously consulted with the British side. However, the British side has made this unresolved issue a unilateral decision public, attempting to create a fait accompli and impose it on the Chinese side, which is unacceptable to us."

Guo Zaizhu pointed out: "The Chinese side insists that the aforementioned issues must be jointly discussed and resolved by the two sides through the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. The British government has no right to make unilateral decisions."

    香港英军设施处理问题英国无权单方作出决定
    新华社香港10月18日电　中英联合联络小组中方首席代表柯在铄就香港添马舰海军基地和目前英国在香港的其他军事设施的处理问题，今天对本社记者发表谈话。
    柯在铄说：“添马舰海军基地和目前英国在香港的其他军事设施的处理，涉及到1997年后中国人民解放军在香港驻军的安排。中英双方在联合联络小组范围内对有关问题进行过多次讨论，但迄今还没有达成一致意见。中方一直采取合作的态度同英方认真磋商，然而英方却把这个尚未解决的问题作为英国单方面的决定公诸于世，以图造成既成事实强加于中方，这是我们不能接受的。”
    柯在铄指出：“中方坚持认为，上述问题必须由中英双方通过中英联合联络小组共同讨论解决，英国政府无权单方面作出决定。”
