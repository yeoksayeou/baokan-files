The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced on October 5 in Oslo that the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize would be awarded to the Dalai Lama.

In a statement to the Norwegian News Agency after the Nobel Committee's decision was made public, Wang Guisheng, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Norway, said: "The Dalai Lama is a political figure who has long been in exile and engaged in activities aimed at splitting and destroying the unity of the motherland. Awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to such a person is interference in China's internal affairs and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people."

He also emphasized: "Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory; the Tibet issue is purely China's internal affair, and no foreign country, organization, or individual has the right to interfere."

The Nobel Committee has repeatedly used the peace prize as a means to achieve certain political purposes, such as awarding it to dissidents in socialist countries and using it to promote Western concepts of "human rights" and "freedom," interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The committee's decision to select the Dalai Lama as this year's peace prize winner has been criticized by international opinion. The Czech newspaper *Rudé Právo* condemned the decision as "interference in China's internal affairs." Georges Marchais, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, believed the peace prize should be awarded to Nelson Mandela, the South African black leader fighting against apartheid, and that awarding it to the Dalai Lama was "shocking" and "inappropriate." He criticized the Nobel Committee's decision as "a politician's trick."

    无理干涉中国内政　伤害中国人民感情
    挪威诺贝尔委员会竟将和平奖授予达赖
    新华社北京10月6日电  挪威诺贝尔委员会于5日在奥斯陆宣布把1989年诺贝尔和平奖授予达赖喇嘛。
    中国驻挪威大使馆参赞王桂生在诺贝尔委员会的决定公布后对挪威通讯社发表谈话指出：“达赖喇嘛是一个流亡国外、长期从事旨在分裂和破坏祖国统一活动的政治人物。把诺贝尔和平奖发给这样一个人，是对中国内政的干涉，伤害了中国人民的感情。”
    他还强调：“西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分；西藏问题完全是中国的内政，任何外国、组织或个人无权干涉。”
    诺贝尔委员会曾一再把和平奖作为达到某种政治目的的手段，如授奖于社会主义国家中的持不同政见者，并借此宣扬西方的“人权”、“自由”等观念，干涉别国内政。该委员会选定达赖喇嘛为本届和平奖获得者已遭到国际舆论的抨击。捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利报》6日谴责这一决定是“干涉中国的内政”。法国共产党总书记乔治·马歇认为应把和平奖授予为反对种族隔离而战的南非黑人领袖纳尔逊·曼德拉，把它授给达赖喇嘛是“令人惊愕的”和“不合适的”。他斥责诺贝尔委员会的这一决定为“政客的小伎俩”。
