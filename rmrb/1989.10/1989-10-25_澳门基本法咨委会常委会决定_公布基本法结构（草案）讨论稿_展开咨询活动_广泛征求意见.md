The Standing Committee of the Basic Law Consultative Committee of Macao held a special meeting last night and decided to publish the draft structure of the Basic Law of Macao for discussion and to launch consultation activities starting immediately to collect opinions widely.

The meeting was chaired by the Committee's Chairman, Cui Deqi. The meeting called on all members, advisors, and various Basic Law concern groups and residents to actively provide their opinions on the structure of the Basic Law to the Committee for compilation and submission to the Basic Law Drafting Committee for reference. The draft structure of the Basic Law, prepared by the drafting group of the Basic Law Drafting Committee, consists of 9 chapters, excluding the preamble, including general provisions, the relationship between the Central Government and the Macao Special Administrative Region, the basic rights and duties of residents, the political system, the economy, culture, external affairs, the interpretation and amendment of this law, and supplementary provisions.

The draft clearly states that the Macao Special Administrative Region will not implement socialist systems and policies, while emphasizing the status of workers, protecting the interests of Portuguese descendants, and respecting their customs and cultural traditions.
