Raise High the Banners of Communism and Patriotism
— Commemorating the 100th Anniversary of Comrade Li Dazhao's Birth
ZHU QIAOXUN

October 29th of this year marks the 100th anniversary of Comrade Li Dazhao's birth. Comrade Li Dazhao was not only a pioneer of the communist movement in China, a great Marxist, and a revolutionary of the proletariat, but also a great patriot. After experiencing the political turmoil of a few months ago, at a time when the Party's 13th Central Committee is determined to more fully implement the basic line of "one central task and two fundamental points," to more consciously and consistently adhere to the four cardinal principles as the foundation of the state, and to more effectively carry out education on patriotism, Marxism, socialism, and communism among the entire Party and the people of the nation, it is particularly meaningful to solemnly commemorate the 100th anniversary of Li Dazhao's birth.

Li Dazhao's Important Role in China's Communist Movement

Firstly, Comrade Li Dazhao's contributions as a pioneer of the communist movement in China, the first Marxist, and one of the main founders of the Chinese Communist Party are indelible. Over 70 years ago, it was he who first raised the banner of Marxism on the land of China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's population. He firmly believed that China and the world would ultimately head towards socialism and communism, and he resolutely predicted: "Look at the future world, it will surely be a world of red flags!" (Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 1, p. 603). He immediately raised this banner and strove to combine the truth of Marxism with China's national conditions and the practical struggles of the Chinese people's revolution, launching a tenacious struggle against imperialism and feudalism. From then on, the communist movement in China began. The first fruit of this movement was the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. It was also Li Dazhao who deeply argued the necessity for Chinese communists to "establish a strong and precise organization," deeply arguing the necessity for a completely new, "people's labor party" for "China's thorough reform" to have something to rely on (see Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 2, p. 444). He was also the first to establish contact with the Communist International. In short, it was he who initiated and, together with Comrade Mao Zedong and others, founded the great Chinese Communist Party. It was precisely because China had a communist movement under the guidance of Marxism and the strong leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party that the fate of the Chinese people was fundamentally changed, and the face of the Chinese revolution was renewed. It was also because of this that we have all the achievements since then and today, and the Chinese people have a brilliant future!

Comrade Li Dazhao, although he died young and his time in the communist movement in China was relatively short, his contributions were very comprehensive.

In terms of party-building practice, due to the research results of local party histories across various regions, we can now quite accurately know that: from Northeast China to Shaanxi and Gansu, from Inner Mongolia to Henan, from large cities to medium and small cities, and even many rural counties, almost half of China's party organizations were initially established under the leadership of Comrade Li Dazhao, or by people he sent to do the work, or under his direct influence and support. In terms of initiating and leading the workers' movement, peasant movement, and national revolutionary movement in the north, in terms of cultivating, educating, and training a large number of party cadres, and even establishing our party's first party school, we now have more sufficient materials to show that he did a lot of work, implemented correct leadership, and made outstanding contributions. In terms of united front work, he was an important formulator and outstanding practitioner of our party's united front policy. He not only made important and key contributions to the first cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang but also did a lot of work with Feng Yuxiang, Hu Jinying, and their led National Revolutionary Army, as well as Guo Songling, Wu Peifu, Yan Xishan, and others. His work with Wu Peifu and others, although there were different understandings within the party, is now seen as completely in line with the Marxist-Leninist principles of proletarian political strategy and played a beneficial role in the development of revolutionary forces or the victory of the Northern Expedition. Even in military work, Comrade Li Dazhao was one of our party's earliest leaders to pay attention to military work. In 1925, he emphasized that our party should seize the military and sent many cadres to learn military affairs and do military work. He also made some very important suggestions regarding the reform of the National Revolutionary Army and its military operations. After adopting these suggestions, the National Revolutionary Army not only consolidated and developed itself in the face of a strong enemy but also better coordinated with the Northern Expedition. Comrade Li Dazhao always advocated that "all things must be done with a down-to-earth attitude, not indulging in empty fantasies or empty talk, but only with a truth-seeking attitude and down-to-earth effort." (Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 2, p. 762) This is also a reflection of his own work attitude. After the party was founded, he continued to use his public identity and social status to propagate Marxism and socialism as decided by the party, while also doing a lot of solid work in various aspects, making great contributions without seeking fame.

It is also worth mentioning the theoretical aspects. Now, there are specialized research papers on almost all aspects of Li Dazhao's thoughts. For example, his views on China's democratic revolution and future socialist economy and politics, his economic thoughts, democratic freedom views, legal views, truth views, ethical and moral views, religious views, views on Eastern and Western cultures, views on national liberation and equality, views on marriage and women's liberation, educational thoughts, and even historical, literary, and aesthetic thoughts. Summarizing the research results of various experts and scholars, as some comrades have pointed out: China's first Marxist, Li Dazhao, was not dogmatic in his attitude towards Marxism. Although he had a process of understanding due to the limitations of historical conditions at the time and was not entirely accurate in all his introductions and discussions, and had some misunderstandings about individual principles, he grasped the most important aspects from the beginning, such as historical materialism, class struggle, the inevitability of the proletariat overthrowing capitalism, implementing public ownership of the means of production, and the victory of socialism, and combined these with China's national conditions and the environment of the time to study, distinguish, and apply them. It was precisely because of this that he was able to propose relatively early that China's democratic revolution must be led by the proletariat, guiding all revolutionary classes forward, and seriously implementing this in practice. In united front work, he actually insisted on the correct policy of both uniting and struggling and the leadership of the proletariat. He was also the first to pay attention to the peasant question and proposed relatively early that peasants are an important revolutionary force in China and the correct proposal to organize poor peasants and rely on the revolutionary forces of workers and peasants to carry out a land revolution. In the many theoretical and ideological fields mentioned above, he also conducted pioneering research in China from a Marxist perspective. In general, he made valuable explorations in applying Marxist principles to China's democratic revolution and had brilliant discussions on socialism and many other aspects. The crystallization of the collective wisdom of our party—Mao Zedong Thought—also has his precious, pioneering contribution.

In the past, during the height of personality cults, it was not possible to objectively affirm Li Dazhao's position in China's communist movement. For example, Kang Sheng once opposed the portrayal of Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership role with the historical role of other old revolutionary comrades, including Li Dazhao, claiming that the latter was attempting to challenge Mao Zedong's authority, even intentionally diminishing Mao Zedong's role. Not to mention the slander and defamation of Comrade Li Dazhao by the "Gang of Four" during the ten years of turmoil. It should be pointed out that allowing only one person to be portrayed and affirmed in China's communist movement is not only an anti-scientific attitude that goes against history but is also very harmful to upholding our party's and China's communist movement's fine traditions and using these traditions to educate the people.

After the Party's 11th Plenary Session of the 3rd Central Committee, the above-mentioned taboos basically no longer exist. However, due to the recent surge of bourgeois liberalization, many people are not interested in or disdain the communist movement, communist ideology, revolutionary traditions, and the lofty ideals and virtues of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries. A few malicious individuals even oppose communism and patriotism, as if only Western capitalism can "save China." This has created new difficulties for the propaganda of Li Dazhao, the study of Li Dazhao, and the objective affirmation of Li Dazhao's important historical position in China's communist movement. Facing the serious corruption that exists, facing the anti-party and anti-socialist turmoil and riots of a few months ago, everyone reflects deeply, the Party summarizes experiences and lessons, and deeply feels that the four cardinal principles, the foundation of the state, must not be abandoned. The fine traditions of China's communist movement must be greatly carried forward, including using the ideals, virtues, and deeds of such old proletarian revolutionaries in China as Li Dazhao to educate the people, educate the next generation, and educate the youth. Under the current political situation, based on the relatively sufficient materials and research results available, it is necessary to further affirm Comrade Li Dazhao's important historical position as a great pioneer of China's communist movement, in order to better propagate him, learn from him, and adhere to the socialist and communist cause he initiated in China.

Li Dazhao's Choice of Marxism and Communism from a Strong Patriotism

Comrade Li Dazhao lived in an era when China had already become a semi-colony, facing the danger of further partition. The crisis of national extinction was seriously placed before every Chinese person. This is what he later said: "On the side of the bed, there is the sound of someone else's snoring; in an independent country, there are traces of being divided by great powers." "The country is in ruins, and the race is annihilated," making it impossible for anyone to remain indifferent. "There is no place for singing and crying in the empty mountains, and there is no place for wandering in the ends of the earth." (See Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 1, pp. 116, 123) Li Dazhao's hometown was in a relatively convenient and well-informed coastal area, with many people going out to do business. He heard stories of the Opium War, the Sino-Japanese War, and the humiliation of the Chinese people by foreigners, as well as various discussions among his fellow villagers about unequal treaties from a young age. At the age of 10, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded his hometown, occupying Changli, Luancheng, and other places, giving him a personal experience of imperialist aggression. During his student days, he further understood the history of modern China being bullied by foreign powers; especially in Japan, he witnessed the objects plundered from China being displayed in a certain military exhibition hall, "boasting of national glory"; "seeing the objects, he was sad, wandering and unwilling to leave," "people commemorated their achievements, and I engraved their shame; people glorified their spirit, and I mourned their hearts. I could only turn my back to people, swallow my tears, and face the wall in silence." The sharp humiliation made him "unable to bear the sorrow of the nation's rise and fall," deeply feeling that he must "painfully rouse himself, revive the spirit of the undead, and turn the tide that has already fallen," striving for national liberation! When Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands to annihilate China, he even wrote in blood, "willing to die for the country," "offering his red heart and green blood to stain the last page of the glorious history of the Yellow Emperor and his descendants." His patriotism was evident in his words! (The above quotes are from Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 1, pp. 122, 115)

On the other hand, the resistance of the Chinese people, especially the advanced elements, i.e., the "righteous people" that Li Dazhao mentioned in his early years, "rushed forward together, hoisting the banner of truth, to rally their comrades, speaking with a hoarse voice, acting with severed heads and limbs, throwing countless heads, bones, thoughts, and blood, rising early and retiring late, never ceasing to fight with the enemy in the dark and sorrowful world" (Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 1, p. 4), greatly inspired and enlightened Li Dazhao. He took these advanced elements as his example, taking the search for the truth to save the country and the people as his mission. At the beginning, he could only learn from the West. He had received systematic education in Western bourgeois political and legal thought, and in his youth, he was most influenced by the bourgeois reformist thoughts of Yan Fu, Tan Sitong, Liang Qichao, and others. He also came into contact with and studied almost all the new trends of thought at the time, was influenced by Darwin's theory of evolution and Kropotkin's mutual aid theory, was influenced by bourgeois humanitarianism and Tolstoy's non-violence theory, introduced Nietzsche's superman philosophy and heroism, introduced European social democracy, introduced and criticized Malthus's population theory, and later was influenced by various utopian socialist trends. He once had great hopes for the bourgeois republic established after the Xinhai Revolution, hoping to solve China's existing problems of warlordism and military rule through the development of capitalist economic relations and the adoption of bourgeois representative systems. Until April 1917, in the article "Theory of Central Power Creation," he still lamented that China "lacks a central power to rely on," leading to "disintegration and chaos," and advocated that "the middle-class people (i.e., the national bourgeoisie or what we later called the national bourgeoisie) should take the initiative to create a new central power as the foundation of the country." (Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 1, pp. 464, 466) In short, many of the proposals that those who advocate bourgeois liberalization in recent years regard as "new trends," Li Dazhao had explored, and even experimented with.

But he finally chose Marxism and communism, choosing scientific socialism, i.e., "revolutionary socialism"; believing that socialism and the world's working class would inevitably defeat "emperors, nobles, warlords, bureaucrats, militarism, capitalism," and that China would necessarily implement socialism and communism in the future, eliminating the system where a small number of exploiters oppress the majority of "workers," which is an "inevitable truth that can only be welcomed, not resisted."

Comrade Li Dazhao's choice of Marxism and communism from a strong patriotism is still instructive today. Because this is the common path taken by a large number of advanced elements in China, it is representative; also because today some people try to oppose patriotism and communism, mixing them with "complete Westernization," deceiving and misleading some young people who know little about Chinese history. Li Dazhao's choice at least gives us the following enlightenment:

Firstly, Marxism and communism are indeed the truth that saves China. As mentioned earlier, Li Dazhao's choice of Marxism and communism was not the result of dogmatism, nor was it the result of blind obedience, nor was it to cater to certain forces in China or abroad. His choice was completely free, made in the context of most people still believing in Western capitalism, combining the times and China's national conditions, and the result of serious and independent thinking. He has always advocated that the highest purpose of life is to seek truth; believing that "if one's words are indeed in accordance with the truth, even if society does not listen to one's words at the moment and even does not tolerate one's existence, one should not hesitate or stammer to cater to this society for the sake of loving the truth; if one's words are indeed against the truth, even if society welcomes one's words at the moment and even values one's existence, one should not flatter or cater to this society for the sake of loving the truth." (Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 1, pp. 445-446) His love for truth and his sincere pursuit of defending truth is not only not inferior to those who claim to pursue truth but actually take pride in following Western civilization, but also has a truly serious and scientific attitude. He used this attitude to repeatedly observe, compare, and explore various doctrines and isms, truly "the road is long and winding, I will seek it up and down," and finally chose Marxism and communism. This was first because he saw from his personal experience and the great victory of the October Revolution that: to defeat imperialism's invasion, oppression, slaughter, and enslavement of China, other doctrines and isms would not do, only under the guidance of Marxism and communism to carry out a social revolution, ultimately establishing a socialist system in China. Just by flipping through the classics such as "The Victory of the Proletariat" and "The Victory of Bolshevism," it is not difficult to know: his choice is closely linked to the need to defeat capitalism's "great...ism." The so-called "great...ism" is "an ism that relies on its own strength to trample on and oppress others. With this ism, human society will not be peaceful." (Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 1, p. 594) This, of course, includes domestic despotism, but first and foremost, it is the "great Europeanism," "great Americanism," "great Germanism," "great Slavism," "great Asianism," "great Japaneseism," etc., that he listed, that is, imperialism, aggression, colonialism, and great power chauvinism! He first recognized from this perspective that Marxism and communism are the only truth that can save China, which is not accidental. This is completely consistent with his strong patriotism. Moreover, from today's perspective, the basis for this choice is still completely correct. It is precisely because Li Dazhao, who always pursued truth and "changed with the times and progressed with the times," was firm and unyielding in defending and practicing his faith throughout his life, truly achieving: "This is what my heart approves, even if I die nine times, I will not regret it!"

At the same time, a large number of advanced elements in China who sought a way out for suffering China all chose Marxism and communism, believing that this is the only truth that can revive China, which is also a historical necessity. Li Dazhao's choice also reflects or represents this historical necessity. From a global perspective, as some comrades have said, the 18th-century bourgeois enlightenment thinker Rousseau's advocacy of "people are born free and equal" and so on, by the 19th century, due to its inapplicability in capitalist society, had already been criticized by some influential bourgeois scholars, who turned to emphasize law and order. By the 20th century, the inherent contradictions of capitalism had further exposed various evils, and the harm of the first imperialist world war made people increasingly disillusioned with it. Marxism, which emerged in the mid-19th century, due to the above reasons and the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, gained increasingly widespread influence. From the perspective of modern Chinese history, since the Opium War, advanced Chinese people have begun to seek the truth to save the country and the people, indeed experiencing countless hardships, including countless times of shattered ideals and countless times of failure and blood and tears. However, the peasant-led Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution and the Boxer Rebellion failed, the bourgeois reformist-led Hundred Days' Reform also failed. Especially the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, this was the most hopeful revolution led by the Chinese bourgeoisie. But it was precisely this revolution and the facts of the following years that proved the uselessness of the Chinese bourgeoisie, proving the bankruptcy and inapplicability of the bourgeois republic in China. Japan's Twenty-One Demands at this time further proved the heart of the teacher to slaughter the student, to collude with and support China's reactionary forces, making those who learned from the West and Japan have to turn back and think. During this period, the ideal of the bourgeois republic collapsed, and people temporarily saw no way out? It can be said that this was one of the darkest periods in Chinese history. It was precisely in this situation that the success of the October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union made the Chinese people see the example of victory, see the dawn of a new era, and find Marxism as a tool and sharp weapon to observe the fate of the country. Li Dazhao's bitter experience after the Xinhai Revolution made him further realize the times and national conditions; he and a generation of advanced elements in China together summarized the experiences and lessons of modern Chinese history, gradually firmly recognizing that: China can only rely on the truth of Marxism and communism, walk the path indicated by the October Revolution, and have a thorough change, which is the only way out. And the new force needed for this great change has already emerged and is gradually rising. This is the proletariat of China. Therefore, he chose Marxism and communism, which is a historical necessity. He was the first to recognize this historical necessity and walked at the forefront of the times, becoming a giant of the times.

Li Dazhao's Patriotism and Communist Spirit Worth Learning Forever

Engels, in evaluating the French materialist enlightenment thinkers, wrote: "If anyone has devoted his whole life to the truth and justice with such ardor, then, for example, Diderot is such a person." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Volume 4, p. 228) We can also say: If anyone has devoted his whole life to the truth and justice, the country and the people with such ardor, making the greatest personal sacrifice, then Li Dazhao is such a person.

Comrade Li Dazhao, as a great communist and proletarian revolutionary, as a great patriot, his devotion to the revolutionary cause was not for personal liberation or individual liberation; from the beginning, he took the task of saving the country and the nation from danger, seeking a way out for the country and the nation, and further took "advancing civilization for the world and creating happiness for mankind" as his life purpose, and finally took communism as his lofty ideal. His strong concern for the country and the people, patriotism and love for the people, and everything for the country and the people, as well as his spirit of selfless devotion for a noble ideal, are the most prominent features of his ideological and moral qualities. Whether he was a democrat or a Marxist, this is consistently and consistently reflected in his articles and his revolutionary practice in various aspects. This can be deeply felt just by flipping through his passionate articles. He often helped students and young people with his meager income, and after the establishment of the communist cell, he used two-thirds of his monthly salary as the party's activity funds, to the extent that President Cai Yuanpei had to deduct his family's monthly living expenses and directly hand them over to his wife Zhao Shulan. His country before family, public before private, selfless devotion truly reached the state of "selflessness." For the revolution, for the salvation of China, for the communist cause, like many old proletarian revolutionaries in China, he truly had a spirit of "destroying the family to relieve the difficulty," truly achieving "bravely advancing and striving for it," "exhausting his strength and energy to accomplish it," "cutting off his head and shedding blood to follow it." This is precisely why he could find the truth of Marxism and communism in China from various complex ideological influences. He could write a proletarian spirit song like "Self-Narrative in Prison" after being arrested by the enemy, facing severe torture and life-and-death tests, and even face the gallows calmly, showing the lofty revolutionary spirit of a communist, which is also not accidental. In him, the high unity of patriotism and communist spirit is truly embodied.

Many people who have come into contact with Comrade Li Dazhao recall that he was humble and sincere in his daily life, able to tolerate and not quarrel with others over personal interests and status in small matters, and had no trace of factionalism, thus being able to unite friends and comrades very well. But in matters involving the insistence on truth, the insistence on principles, and revolutionary interests, he never retreated. For this, he was not afraid to offend the powerful, old friends, or even the entire upper class at that time. This can be seen from his break with the Research Clique, his criticism of Hu Shi, and his break with Bai Jianwu, among others. "Shoulders carrying righteousness, hands writing articles" can be used as a portrayal of his noble character in this aspect.

Finally, Li Dazhao, as a great patriot, his confidence and self-respect in our nation, and his attitude towards the essence and dross in our traditional national culture, are also of great enlightenment and educational significance to us. Li Dazhao, as one of the brave warriors of the New Culture Movement of the May Fourth era, was indeed a pioneer of ideological liberation. He mercilessly and thoroughly criticized the superstition of Confucius and others, criticized feudal ethics and feudal rites, and also criticized feudal autocracy and division. However, when he thoroughly criticized feudal culture, he did not entirely deny our national traditional culture, especially the excellent things in our national culture. He criticized the old "gray-haired China," but at the same time encouraged people to create a new "youthful China" with full confidence. Therefore, reading his texts in this aspect will not make people lose national self-respect and self-confidence, leading to a certain sense of inferiority; on the contrary, it will only be infected by his strong "youthful spirit," with more abundant patriotism to strive to create the future of our nation. Li Dazhao also emphasized many times that we must learn the progressive things in Western civilization, but he believed: "Eastern and Western civilizations have their strengths and weaknesses, and it is not appropriate to arbitrarily compare them." (Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Volume 1, p. 560) He also quoted a professor from the United States as saying: If in the future there is a nation that can occupy a large part of the various nations in the world, "it will be the Chinese people?" Because of their large numbers, strong endurance, deep love for peace, firm character and personality, superior intelligence, and the ability to adapt to the highest moral concepts, they are the elements to become the final nation of the world. Of course, this depends on whether the Chinese nation can successfully adapt to the new era and new environment of the world. His attitude not only distinguishes him from those who reject all foreign cultures, are arrogant, and advocate closing the country; it also distinguishes him from those who completely deny their own national culture, are blindly inferior and worship foreign cultures, and advocate "complete Westernization," treating Western civilization as a panacea for all of China's ills. This attitude truly embodies the spirit of the May Fourth cultural revolution and patriotism. In modern Chinese history, those who clung to the old feudal culture and refused to let go were not true patriots, and those who believed that foreign moons were rounder and worshipped the West were even less likely to be patriots. In fact, in the new awakening of national consciousness based on the May Fourth Movement, the generations of patriotic intellectuals in China, including Li Dazhao, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and other Marxists, as well as many non-Marxist true patriots, never denied the excellent things in their own national culture. On the contrary, their deep and persistent patriotism was based on their understanding and respect for the essence of their national culture, as well as their criticism and rejection of its dross. Without this foundation, as an intellectual, his patriotism would not be truly solid.

Let us raise high the banners of communism and patriotism to promote further research, propaganda, and learning of Li Dazhao, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Comrade Li Dazhao's birth! (Attached is a picture)

    更高地举起共产主义和爱国主义的旗帜
    ——纪念李大钊同志庭辰一百周年
    朱乔森
    今年10月29日，是李大钊同志诞辰100周年。大钊同志不但是我国共产主义运动的先驱者、伟大的马克思主义者和无产阶级革命家，也是伟大的爱国主义者。在经历了几个月前的政治风波之后，在党的十三届四中全会决心更加全面地贯彻执行“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，更加自觉和始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则这个立国之本，更加切实地在全党全国人民中开展爱国主义、马克思主义、社会主义和共产主义教育的时候，隆重纪念李大钊诞辰100周年，尤其具有深刻的现实意义。
    李大钊在我国共产主义运动史上具有重要地位
    首先，李大钊同志作为我国共产主义运动的先驱者、第一个马克思主义者和中国共产党的主要创始人之一的伟大贡献，是不可磨灭的。70多年前，是他，在占世界人口近1／4的中国大地上，首先举起了马克思主义的旗帜，认定中国和世界最终必将走向社会主义和共产主义，坚定地预言了：“试看将来的环球，必是赤旗的世界！”（《李大钊文集》上卷，第603页）并立即高擎起这面旗帜，努力把马克思主义的真理同中国的国情、同我国人民革命的实践相结合，向着帝国主义和封建主义展开了坚强不屈的斗争。从此，开始了我国的共产主义运动。这一运动的第一个硕果，就是中国共产党的成立。也是李大钊同志，深刻地论证了我国共产主义者“成立一个强固的精密的组织”的必要性，深刻地论证了必须有一个全新的、“平民的劳动家的政党”，“中国彻底的大改革”才“有所附托”（见《李大钊文集》下卷，第444页），并最早与共产国际建立联系；总之，是他，首先发起并与毛泽东同志等一道，创立了伟大的中国共产党。正是因为中国有了马克思主义指导下的共产主义运动，有了伟大的中国共产党及其坚强领导，才彻底改变了中国人民的命运，并使中国革命的面貌为之一新；也才有了此后和我们今天的一切成就，中国人民才有了光辉灿烂的未来！
    李大钊同志虽然由于过早牺牲，从事我国共产主义运动的时间相对说来较短，但他的贡献也是非常全面的。
    在建党实践方面，主要是由于各地对地方党史的研究成果，现在我们已经可以相当确切地知道：从我国东北到陕甘，从内蒙到河南的各省区，从大城市到中小城市乃至许多县份的农村，几乎半个中国的党组织，最初都是在李大钊同志的领导下，或者由他派人去做工作，或者在他直接影响和支持下建立起来的。在开创和领导北方的工人运动、农民运动和国民革命运动方面，在培养、教育、训练党的大批干部以至于创建我们党的第一所党校方面，我们现在也有更充分的材料说明，他做了大量工作，实行了正确的领导并作出了杰出贡献。在统一战线工作方面，他是我党统一战线政策的重要制定者和卓越实践者，不仅是对首次国共合作的重要的、关键性的贡献，他还对冯玉祥、胡景翼及其领导下的国民军，对郭松龄以至吴佩孚、阎锡山等人做过许多工作。他对吴佩孚等人的工作，尽管党内曾经有过不同认识，但现在看来，在理论上是完全符合马列主义关于无产阶级政治策略的原理的，在实践上对革命力量的发展或北伐战争的胜利是起过有利作用的。甚至在军事工作方面，李大钊同志也是我们党最早重视军事工作的领导人之一。他在1925年就强调我们党要抓军队，并派遣了许多干部去学军事，做军队工作。他还对国民军的改造及其军事行动提出过一些非常重要的建议，国民军采纳这些建议后，既在强敌面前巩固和发展了自己，又更好地配合了北伐战争。大钊同志历来主张“凡事都要脚踏实地去作，不驰于空想，不骛于虚声，而惟以求真的态度作踏实的工夫。”（《李大钊文集》下卷，第762页）这也是他本人工作态度的写照。党成立后，他一面遵照党的决定，继续利用自己的公开身份和社会声望宣传马克思主义与社会主义；一面的确扎扎实实地做了令人吃惊的大量工作，不事喧哗地在多方面作出了巨大贡献。
    还应当提到思想理论方面。现在，几乎对李大钊各方面的思想都有了专门的研究论文。例如他关于我国民主革命和未来社会主义经济、政治的主张，他的社会经济思想、民主自由观、法律观、真理观、伦理道德观、宗教观、中西文化观、民族解放和民族平等的思想、婚姻和妇女解放的思想、教育思想，乃至史学、文学、美学思想等等。综合各位专家学者的研究成果，正像有的同志所指出的：中国第一个马克思主义者李大钊对待马克思主义的态度就不是教条主义的。虽然他对马克思主义由于当时历史条件的限制也曾有过一个认识过程，并非所有的介绍和论述都是很精确的，对个别原理也曾有过误解；但他从一开始就抓住了其中最重要的东西，例如唯物史观、阶级斗争、无产阶级必将推翻资本主义、实行生产资料公有制、社会主义必将胜利等，并结合我国的国情，结合当时的时代环境来加以研究、辨别和应用。正因为如此，他才能较早地提出我国的民主革命必须由无产阶级当先锋，带领各革命阶级向前走，并认真付诸实践，在统一战线工作实际上坚持了又联合又斗争的正确方针和无产阶级的领导权，才能最早重视农民问题，并较早地提出农民是我国重要的革命动力和组织贫雇农、依靠工农阶级的革命力量实行土地革命的正确主张。在上面提到的许多理论、思想领域，他也都用马克思主义观点进行过在我国可算是开创性的研究。总的来说，他应用马克思主义原理对我国民主革命作过宝贵的探索，对社会主义和其他许多方面也有过精采的论述。我党集体智慧的结晶——毛泽东思想的形成，也有他一份宝贵的、开拓性的贡献。
    过去，在个人崇拜盛行的时候，不大可能实事求是地肯定李大钊在我国共产主义运动史上的地位。例如康生就曾把表现毛泽东同志的领导作用，同描写或表现其他老一辈无产阶级革命家包括李大钊的历史作用对立起来，把后者说成是企图用别人来同毛泽东“分庭抗礼”，甚至是有意贬低毛泽东的作用。更不用说十年动乱中“四人帮”对大钊同志的种种诋毁诬蔑了。应当指出的是：对于我国的共产主义运动只允许表现和肯定一个人，这不仅是一种违背历史的反科学的态度，而且对于坚持我们党和我国共产主义运动的优良传统并用这种传统来教育人民，也是十分有害的。
    党的十一届三中全会之后，上述禁区基本上不复存在了。但是，由于近几年资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，不少人对什么共产主义运动、共产主义思想，什么革命传统，什么老一辈无产阶级革命家的崇高理想和品德，不感兴趣，不屑一顾。极少数别有用心的人甚至把共产主义和爱国主义对立起来，似乎只有西方资本主义那一套才能“救中国”。这又给宣传李大钊、学习李大钊，也给实事求是地肯定李大钊在我国共产主义运动史上的地位造成了新的困难。面对严重存在的腐败现象，面对几个月前反党反社会主义的动乱和暴乱，大家痛定思痛，全党总结经验教训，深感四项基本原则这个立国之本不可丢，我国共产主义运动的优良传统还须大大发扬，其中包括用李大钊这样的我国老一辈无产阶级革命家的理想、品德、事迹来教育人民，教育后代，教育青年。在当前的政治形势下，根据已有的较充分的材料和研究成果，进一步肯定作为我国共产主义运动伟大先驱者的李大钊同志的重要历史地位，以便更好地宣传他、学习他，坚持他所开创的我国社会主义和共产主义事业，这是十分必要的。
    李大钊从强烈的爱国主义出发选择了马克思主义和共产主义
    李大钊同志生活的年代，是中国已经完全沦为半殖民地、正面临着被进一步瓜分的危险的年代。亡国灭种的危机，严重地摆在每一个中国人的面前。这就是他后来所说的：“卧榻之侧，有他人鼾睡之声，独立之邦，伏列强割据之迹。”“国社为墟，种族随殄”的危险，使人人都不可能置身事外，“空山已无歌哭之地，天涯不容漂泊之人。”（见《李大钊文集》上卷，第116、123页）李大钊的家乡，在交通比较便利、信息比较灵通的沿海，外出经商的人多，他从小就听到了鸦片战争、甲午战争以及中国人受洋人欺辱等痛心的历史故事和乡亲们关于不平等条约的种种议论。10岁那年，八国联军入侵至他的家乡附近，占据了昌黎、滦州等地，使他对帝国主义的蛮横侵略有了切身感受。学生时代，他又进一步了解了近代中国被列强欺凌的历史；尤其是在日本，他目睹对方把从中国掠夺去的物品，摆在某军事陈列馆中，“夸为国荣”；“睹物伤怀，徘徊不忍去”，“人以纪其功，我以铭其耻；人以壮其气，我以痛其心。惟有背人咽泪，面壁吞声而已。”尖锐的屈辱，使他“不胜国家兴亡之慨”，深感必须“痛自振励，起未死之人心，挽狂澜于既倒”，争取民族的解放！。到日本提出灭亡中国的二十一条，他更是泣血陈辞，“愿为国死”，“出其丹心碧血，染吾黄帝以降列祖列宗光荣历史之末页。”爱国之心，溢于言表！（以上引文见《李大钊文集》上卷，第122、115页）
    另一方面，中国人民的反抗，尤其是其中的先进分子，即李大钊早年所说的“仁人义士”，“相率奔驰，昭揭真理之帜，以号召俦类，言之者瘏口哓音，行之者断头绝脰，掷无量数之头颅、骸骨、心思、脑血，夙兴夜寐，无时不与此贼民之徒，相激战于黯黯冤愁之天地中”（《李大钊文集》上卷，第4页），又给李大钊以极大的鼓舞和启迪。他立志以这些先进分子为榜样，以寻求救国救民的真理为己任。而在其开始，只能是向西方学习。他本来就受过西方资产阶级政治法律思想的系统教育，在青年时代对他影响最大的，曾经是严复、谭嗣同、梁启超等人的资产阶级改良主义思想。他还接触和研究过当时所能接触到的几乎所有新思潮，受过达尔文进化论和克鲁泡特金互助论的影响，受过资产阶级人道主义和托尔斯泰非暴力论的影响，介绍过尼采的超人哲学和英雄主义，介绍过欧洲的社会民主主义，介绍和批判过马尔萨斯的人口论，后来又受过多种空想社会主义思潮的影响。他曾经对辛亥革命后成立的形式上的资产阶级共和国抱有很大的希望，期望通过发展资本主义经济关系，采用资产阶级代议制来解决中国当时存在的军阀专制割据等痼疾。直到1917年4月，在《中心势力创造论》一文中，他还痛感中国“无中心势力所可凭依”，导致“分崩离析，扰攘溃裂”，而主张“由中流社会之有恒产者（即中产阶级或我们后来所说的民族资产阶级——笔者注）自进而造成新中心势力，以为国本之所托。”（《李大钊文集》上卷，第464、466页），总之，近几年鼓吹资产阶级自由化的那些人视为“新潮”的不少主张，李大钊都曾经探索过，甚至试验过。
    但他最后还是选择了马克思主义和共产主义，选择了科学社会主义即“革命的社会主义”；认为社会主义和世界劳工阶级战胜“什么皇帝咧，贵族咧，军阀咧，官僚咧，军国主义咧，资本主义咧”，是不可避免的；中国将来必要实行社会主义和共产主义，消灭极少数剥削者压迫大多数“劳工”的制度，这是“只可迎，不可拒”的客观真理。
    李大钊同志从强烈的爱国主义出发而选择了马克思主义和共产主义这一事实，在今天对我们仍然富有教益。因为这是我国一大批先进分子所走过的共同道路，具有代表性；也因为今天有人企图把爱国主义同共产主义对立起来，而同“全盘西化”搅在一起，蛊惑和蒙蔽一部分对中国历史知之不多的青年。李大钊这一选择至少给我们如下启示：
    首先，马克思主义和共产主义确乎是救中国的真理。如前所述，李大钊选择马克思主义和共产主义，绝不是什么教条主义的结果，更不是什么盲目性的结果，也不是迎合中国或外国的某些势力。他的选择是完全自由的选择，是在多数人都还相信西方资本主义的情况下，结合时代环境，结合中国国情，经过认真的独立思考的结果。他历来主张人生的最高目的，在于求达真理；认为“苟其言之确合乎真理，虽一时之社会不听吾说，且至不容吾身，吾为爱真理之故，而不敢有所逡巡嗫嚅以迎附此社会；苟其言之确背乎真理，虽一时之社会欢迎吾说，而并重视吾身，吾为爱真理之故，而不敢有所附合唯阿，以趋承此社会。”（《李大钊文集》上卷，第445至446页）他对真理的热爱，追求捍卫真理的热诚，不但丝毫不亚于那些自诩为追求真理，实则以追随西方文明为荣的人，而且具有真正严肃和科学的态度。他用这样的态度对多种学说、主义进行了反复观察、反复比较、反复探索，真可谓“路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索”，而最终选择了马克思主义和共产主义。这首先是因为，他从亲身体验和十月革命的伟大胜利看到了：要战胜帝国主义对中国的侵略、压迫、宰割和奴役，别的学说、主义都不行，只有在马克思主义和共产主义的指引下实行社会革命，最终在中国建立社会主义制度。只要翻一翻《庶民的胜利》、《Bolshevism的胜利》等名著就不难知道：他的这一选择是同要战胜资本主义的“大……主义”紧紧联系在一起的。所谓“大……主义”，“就是仗着自己的强力蹂躏他人欺压他人的主义。有了这种主义，人类社会就不安宁了。”（《李大钊文集》上卷，第594页）这当然也包括国内的专制主义，但首先是他所例举的“大欧罗巴主义”、“大美利坚主义”、“大日耳曼主义”、“大斯拉夫主义”、“大亚细亚主义”、“大日本主义”等，也就是帝国主义、侵略主义、殖民主义、大国沙文主义！他首先从这一角度认识了马克思主义和共产主义是唯一能救中国的真理，不是偶然的。这同他的强烈爱国思想是完全一致的。而且在今天看来，这种选择的根据仍然是完全正确的。也正因为如此，不断追求真理，“月异岁新，与时俱进”的李大钊同志，才会终其一生，坚定不移地捍卫和实践自己的这一信仰，真正做到了：“亦余心之所善兮，虽九死其犹未悔”！
    同时，我国一大批为苦难的中国四处寻求出路的先进分子，所以都选择了马克思主义和共产主义，认定这是唯一能振兴中国的真理，也是历史的必然。李大钊的选择也正反映或代表了这种历史的必然。从世界范围看，正如有的同志所说，18世纪资产阶级启蒙思想家卢梭关于“人生而自由平等”等主张，到了19世纪，由于在资本主义社会行不通，已经受到一些有影响的资产阶级学者的批判，他们转而强调法律和秩序。到了20世纪，资本主义固有的矛盾所造成的种种弊端进一步暴露，第一次帝国主义世界大战的祸害更使人们对它日益失望。而19世纪中叶产生的马克思主义，由于上述原因和俄国十月社会主义革命的胜利，赢得了越来越广泛的影响。从我国近代历史看，自鸦片战争起，先进的中国人就开始寻找救国救民的真理，的确经历了千辛万苦，其间包含着无数次理想破灭的辛酸，也包含着无数次失败的血泪和痛苦。但是，农民阶级领导的太平天国革命和义和团运动失败了，资产阶级改良派领导的戊戌维新也失败了。尤其是1911年的辛亥革命，这是中国资产阶级所领导的最有胜利希望的一次革命。但也正是这次革命及其以后若干年的事实，证明了中国资产阶级的不中用，证明了资产阶级共和国那一套在中国的破产和行不通。日本在这时提出的二十一条，更证明了先生要宰割学生，要勾结和支持中国反动势力的本心，使向西方和日本学习的人们不得不回过头来思考。这一时期，资产阶级共和国的理想破灭了，人们一时又看不到出路在哪里？可以说是中国历史上最黑暗的时期之一。也就是毛泽东当时所说的：“国家坏到了极处，人类苦到了极处，社会黑暗到了极处。”正是在这种情况下，十月革命的成功和社会主义苏俄的建立，使中国人看到了胜利的榜样，看到了新纪元的曙光，找到了马克思主义这个观察国家命运的工具和锐利武器。李大钊在辛亥革命后的辛酸阅历，使他进一步认清了时代和国情；他和我国一代先进分子在一起，总结了中国近代历史的经验教训，逐步坚定地认识到：中国只有依据马克思主义和共产主义的真理，走十月革命所指引的道路，来一次彻底的大变动，才是唯一的出路。而这场大变动所需要的新的力量已经有了，正在逐步兴起。这就是中国的无产阶级。因此他选择马克思主义和共产主义，是历史的必然。他最早认清了这一历史的必然，走在了时代潮流的最前面，就成了时代的巨人。
    李大钊的爱国主义和共产主义精神值得我们永远学习
    恩格斯在评价法国唯物主义启蒙思想家时写过：“如果说，有谁为了对真理和正义的热诚，而献出了整个生命，那末，例如狄德罗就是这样的人。”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第四卷，第228页）我们也完全可以这样讲：如果说，有谁为了对真理和正义、祖国和人民的热诚而献出了整个生命，作出了最大的个人牺牲，那末，李大钊就是这样的人。
    李大钊同志作为伟大的共产主义者和无产阶级革命家，作为一个伟大的爱国主义者，他的投身革命事业，不是从个人的解放或个性解放出发的；而是从一开始，就以挽救国家民族的危亡，为国家民族寻找出路为己任，进而以“为世界进文明，为人类造幸福”作为自己的人生目的，最后又以共产主义作为自己的崇高理想。他的强烈的忧国忧民、爱国爱民和一切为国为民的思想以及为了高尚理想而彻底献身的精神，作为他的思想道德品质最突出的特点，不论在他是民主主义者时也好，马克思主义者时也好，都充溢在他的文章的字里行间，表现在他的革命实践的各个方面，是一贯的、始终如一的。这只要翻阅一下他那些热情洋溢的文章，就不难深切地感到。他经常以自己微薄的收入帮助学生、帮助青年，在共产主义小组成立后，更以自己每月工资的三分之二作为党的活动经费，以至蔡元培校长不得不把他家每月生活费扣下，而直接交给夫人赵纫兰。他的国而忘家、公而忘私、舍己为人，真正达到了“忘我”的境地。为了革命，为了救中国，为了共产主义事业，同我国不少老一辈无产阶级革命家一样，他真有一种“毁家纾难”的精神，的确做到了“勇往奋进以赴之”，“瘅精瘁力以成之”，“断头流血以从之”。这正是他能够从各种错综复杂的思想影响中，在中国首先找到马克思主义和共产主义的真理的一个根本的“内因”。他能够在被敌人逮捕之后，在严刑逼供和生死考验面前，写出像《狱中自述》那样的无产阶级正气歌，直到在绞刑台上从容就义，表现了共产党人崇高的革命气节，也绝不是偶然的。在他的身上，才真正体现了爱国主义和共产主义精神的高度统一。
    不少接触过李大钊同志的人都回忆：他平时为人谦和、诚挚，在小事上，在涉及个人名利地位的事情上能忍让，从不跟别人闹个人意气，从无半点宗派气，因而能极好地团结朋友和同志。但在涉及坚持真理、坚持原则和革命利益的事情上却绝不退让。为此而不怕得罪权贵、老友甚至当时的整个上流社会。这从他同研究系的决裂、对胡适的批判和跟白坚武的断交等，都不难看到。“铁肩担道义，妙手著文章”可作为他这方面高贵品格的写照。
    最后，李大钊作为一个伟大的爱国主义者，他对我们民族的自信心和自尊心，对我们传统民族文化中精华和糟粕的态度，也是对我们极有启迪和教育意义的。李大钊作为五四新文化运动的勇猛战将之一，确实是思想解放的先驱，他毫不留情地、深刻彻底地批判了对孔子等人的迷信，批判了封建的伦理道德和封建礼教，还批判了封建专制和割据，但他在彻底批判封建文化时，却绝不整个地否定我们民族的传统文化，尤其是我们民族文化中那些优秀的东西。他批判旧的“白首之中华”，但同时就鼓励人们满怀信心地去创造新的“青春之中华”。因此，阅读他这方面的文字，绝不会使人丧失民族自尊心和自信心，以致产生某种他信力；相反地，只会受到他的“青春之气”的强烈感染，以更充沛的爱国主义精神去努力创造我们民族的未来。李大钊也曾多次强调我们必须学习西方文明中那些进步的东西，但是他认为：“东西文明，互有长短，不宜妄为轩轾于其间”。（《李大钊文集》上卷，第560页）他还引述一位美国教授的话说：如果将来有一个民族能在世界最后的各民族中占一大部分的话，“其惟中国人乎？”因为，其数量之众，忍苦之强，爱重平和之切，人格品性之坚，智力之优和适应最高道德观念的能力，都是成为世界最终民族的要素。当然，这取决于中华民族能否成功地适应世界的新时代、新环境。他的这种态度，既区别于那些排斥一切外来文化，妄自尊大，主张闭关锁国的人；也区别于那些全盘否定自己的民族文化，盲目自卑和崇洋，而主张“全盘西化”，把西方文明奉为包治中国百病的万应灵丹的人。这种态度，才真正体现了五四文化革命的精神和爱国主义精神。在中国近代历史上，那些抱残守阙，抱着旧的封建文化不放的人，不可能成为真正的爱国者，而那些认为外国月亮比中国圆，迷信西方的人，更不可能成为爱国者。事实上，在五四运动民族意识新觉醒的基础上成长起来的我国一代又一代爱国知识分子，包括李大钊、毛泽东、周恩来这样的马克思主义者，也包括不少非马克思主义者的真正的爱国者，都从没有否定自己民族文化中那些优秀的东西，相反地，对自己民族文化精华的了解和尊重，以及对它的精糟的扬弃，倒是他们深沉和执著的爱国思想的基础。没有这个基础，作为一名知识分子，他的爱国思想不可能是真正牢固的。
    让我们用更高地举起共产主义和爱国主义的旗帜，来推动对于李大钊的进一步研究、宣传和学习，来纪念李大钊同志诞辰100周年！（附图片）
