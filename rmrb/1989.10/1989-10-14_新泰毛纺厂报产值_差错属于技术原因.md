The article "Analysis of Unrealistic Statistical Figures" published on the 6th page of your newspaper on August 19 stated that "Shandong New Tai City Wool Mill falsely reported one-third of its output value in 1988." After investigation, it was found that the original report significantly deviated from the facts. The actual errors identified were twofold: first, the knitting division of the mill duplicated the calculation of output value by 350,000 yuan; second, the Tai Shun Company, a joint venture between the mill and a Hong Kong businessman, had independent accounting, but its 730,000 yuan output value for 1988 was also included in the total output value of New Tai City Wool Mill. The investigation showed that the total output value of New Tai City Wool Mill for 1988 was basically correct. The duplicated calculations, including the portion from Tai Shun Company, accounted for 3.89% and were due to technical errors, not intentional overreporting of output value.

    新泰毛纺厂报产值　差错属于技术原因
    8月19日你报第6版《统计数字不实剖析》一文说“山东新泰市毛纺厂1988年虚报产值1／3”，经查证，原反应材料与事实出入太大。而实际查出的虚数有两笔：一是该厂经编分厂重复计算产值35万元；二是该厂与港商合资建的泰顺公司，已独立核算，但1988年泰顺公司73万元产值也统计在新泰市毛纺厂总产值中。从调查看，新泰市毛纺厂1988年的总产值统计基本上是正确的，重复计算的部分包括泰顺公司部分，共占3.89％，属技术性差错，并非有意虚报产值。
