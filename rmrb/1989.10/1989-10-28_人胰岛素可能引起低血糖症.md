British health authorities have recently issued a warning stating that insulin produced through genetic engineering may cause hypoglycemia.

This year, at least 17 diabetic patients have suddenly died after using this new medication. Particularly among diabetic patients under the age of 25, the number of sudden deaths has been alarmingly increasing. These diabetic patients regularly inject themselves with insulin produced through genetic engineering, which has now widely replaced insulin extracted from animals.

Experts say that diabetic patients who inject this new drug may not realize they have hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia is left untreated, it can lead to fatal shock.

When injecting insulin extracted from animals, early symptoms of hypoglycemia such as sweating and palpitations can be easily noticed. However, when injecting insulin produced through genetic engineering, symptoms of hypoglycemia are not easily detected.

　　人胰岛素可能引起低血糖症
    英国卫生当局最近发出警告说，用遗传工程方法制造的人胰岛素可能会引起低血糖症。
    今年至少已有17名糖尿病人在使用这种新的药物后突然死亡。特别是在25岁以下的糖尿病人中，突然死亡的人数在惊人地增加。这些糖尿病人给自己定期注射用遗传工程方法制造的人胰岛素，这种新药物现已广泛取代用动物提取的胰岛素。
    专家们说，糖尿病人在注射这种新药物后，不知道自己得低血糖症。低血糖症如果得不到治疗会引起致命的休克。
    注射用动物提取的胰岛素，会出现低血糖症的早期症状，如盗汗和心悸等，很容易被觉察。但是，注射用遗传工程方法制造的人胰岛素，低血糖症状不容易被发现。（新）
