Latin American leaders are encouraged by the easing of the current international situation and the prospect of a prolonged period of peace. However, they believe that the debt issue is progressing slowly and that the solutions to the debt problem are insufficient. The stability and consolidation of democracy in Latin America largely depend on the resolution of this issue. This is the view expressed in the declaration issued at the conclusion of the summit of the Eight-Nation Group of Latin America.

The summit concluded this afternoon, with the seven participating presidents signing the "Ica Declaration."

The declaration states that Latin America's external debt remains one of the most serious problems facing the region. The impact of the debt issue is evident in the severe deterioration of social, political, and economic conditions, and urgent solutions are needed. The declaration emphasizes that reducing debt or interest rates should play a fundamental role in solving the debt problem. Debt reduction plans should be implemented without discrimination among debtor countries, and the international financial community is urged to continue providing credit for economic and social development.

In discussing regional security issues, the declaration first addressed the issue of drug trafficking, reaffirming each country's determination to fight against drug trafficking and abuse. It also noted that eliminating these behaviors requires a comprehensive solution and cooperation between producing and consuming countries.

Regarding the achievements of the Central American leaders at the Tegucigalpa Summit, the Eight-Nation Group leaders expressed satisfaction and called on all parties concerned to take actions that would facilitate a complete resolution of the crisis in the region, rather than actions that would hinder the peace process in Central America.

    拉美八国集团首脑会议发表《伊卡宣言》
    要求尽早妥善解决债务问题
    本报秘鲁伊卡10月12日电  记者朱满庭报道：拉美国家领导人对当前国际形势出现的缓和和一个较长时期的和平前景感到鼓舞，但同时认为债务问题进展缓慢，解决债务问题的办法尚不充分，拉美的稳定和民主的巩固在很大程度上取决于这个问题的解决。这是拉美8国集团首脑会议在结束时发表的《宣言》中所表达的对当前国际形势的看法。
    这次首脑会议于今天下午宣布结束。与会7国总统签署了一项《伊卡宣言》。
    《宣言》指出，拉丁美洲的外债继续是这一地区面临的最严重的问题之一。债务问题的影响已表现在社会、政治和经济形势的严重恶化，特别需要急迫解决。《宣言》强调减少债务或债息应在解决债务问题中发挥根本性的作用，减债计划应无歧视地在各债务国中实施，同时还要求国际金融界继续提供用于经济和社会发展的信贷。
    《宣言》在论述地区安全问题时，首先提到了人们关心的反毒品问题，重申了各国将尽一切努力对贩毒、吸毒进行斗争的决心，并指出要消灭这些行为必须有一项全面的解决办法，有生产国和消费国的协作。
    对中美洲国家首脑在洪都拉斯特拉会议中取得的成果，8国集团领导人表示满意，并呼吁有关各方做有利于这一地区危机彻底解决的事，不要做妨碍中美洲和平进程的事。
