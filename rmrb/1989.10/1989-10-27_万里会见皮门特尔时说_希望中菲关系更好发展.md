Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with a delegation led by Philippine Senator Aquilino Pimentel this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People.

Wan Li briefed the guests on China's current political and economic situation. He said that the Chinese Communist Party and the government plan to resolve current economic issues within three years, aiming for stable and coordinated economic development.

Wan Li emphasized that China's independent and peaceful foreign policy will not change. China opposes any country with diplomatic relations with China from establishing official ties with Taiwan and opposes Taiwan's authorities using "flexible diplomacy" and economic means to lure certain countries, attempting to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."

Regarding bilateral relations, Wan Li said that China-Philippines relations have always developed well, and he hopes for even better development in the future.

Pimentel stated that the Philippine government adheres to the one-China policy. Only by adhering to this can the friendly relations between the Philippines and China move forward. He appreciated China's government's policy of "one country, two systems" to achieve national reunification peacefully.

In the evening, Vice Chairman Hab Comin hosted a reception and banquet for the Philippine guests at the Great Hall of the People.

The delegation, led by Senator Pimentel, arrived in Beijing yesterday at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for a friendly visit. The guests will visit Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen during their stay in China.

　　万里会见皮门特尔时说
　　希望中菲关系更好发展
    新华社北京10月26日电  （记者周慈朴）全国人大常委会委员长万里今天下午在人民大会堂会见了菲律宾参议员阿基里诺·皮门特尔一行。
    万里向客人们介绍了当前中国的政治和经济情况。他说，中国党和政府打算用3年时间来解决当前的经济问题，使经济稳定、协调地向前发展。
    万里指出，中国的独立自主的和平外交政策不会变。中国反对任何与中国有外交关系的国家同台湾发生官方关系，反对台湾当局采取“弹性外交”，用经济手段拉拢某些国家，企图制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”。
    谈到双边关系时，万里说，中菲两国关系一直发展得很好，并希望这种关系发展得更好。
    皮门特尔说，菲律宾政府坚持一个中国的政策。只有坚持这一点，菲中两国的友好关系才能向前发展。他赞赏中国政府奉行“一国两制”的政策来实现祖国的和平统一。
    晚上，习仲勋副委员长在人民大会堂会见并宴请菲律宾客人。
    皮门特尔参议员一行是应全国人大常委会的邀请前来进行友好访问，于昨天抵达北京的。客人们将在中国访问北京、天津、广州和深圳。
