	BEIJING, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Tegucigalpa -- A Boeing 727 passenger plane of Honduras' "Tansa" Airlines crashed 21st morning 25 kilometers south of the capital Tegucigalpa, killing 123 people and injuring 14.

	The plane took off from Costa Rica, stopped in Nicaragua and Honduras, and was heading to the United States. The plane crashed two minutes before it was due to land in Tegucigalpa at 7:55 a.m. on a small hill. At that time, Tegucigalpa was experiencing strong winds, and the area where the plane crashed was shrouded in thick fog. The wreckage and the bodies of the victims were scattered over an area of 1,500 square meters. The rescue operation lasted eight hours, and the injured and the dead were all transported to Tegucigalpa by Honduran Air Force helicopters.

	The plane carried eight crew members and 129 passengers. Among the passengers, there were 61 Nicaraguans, 32 Costa Ricans, and 15 Hondurans.

	Among the victims was Armando Blanco, the Minister of Labor of Honduras.

	The crashed plane was rented by "Tansa" from the American "Continental" company and was scheduled to be returned after completing 25 years of service in January 1990.

　　洪都拉斯一架波音客机坠毁
　　一百二十三人死亡十四人重伤
    新华社北京十月二十二日电　特古西加尔巴消息：洪都拉斯“坦萨萨”航空公司的一架波音七二七客机二十一日早晨在离首都特古西加尔巴以南二十五公里处坠毁，造成一百二十三人死亡，十四人重伤。
    这架飞机从哥斯达黎加起飞，经尼加拉瓜和洪都拉斯前往美国。飞机在即将抵达特古西加尔巴两分钟前，于七时五十五分坠毁在一座小山上。当时特古西加尔巴正刮大风，而飞机坠毁的那一带大雾弥漫。飞机残骸和遇难者尸体散落在一千五百平方米的地面上。抢救工作持续八小时，伤员和死者都已由洪都拉斯空军的直升机运到特古西加尔巴。
    机上载有八名机组人员和一百二十九名乘客。乘客中有六十一名尼加拉瓜人，三十二名哥斯达黎加人和十五名洪都拉斯人。
    死难者中有洪都拉斯劳工部长阿曼多·布兰科。
    失事飞机是“坦萨萨”公司从美国“大陆”公司那里租来的，原计划在飞行满二十五年之后于一九九零年一月归还。
