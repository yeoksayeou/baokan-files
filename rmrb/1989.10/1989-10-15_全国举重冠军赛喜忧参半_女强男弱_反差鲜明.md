The national weightlifting championship, featuring 29 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and units such as the People's Liberation Army and the Silver Eagle Sports Association, with over 450 male and female athletes, concluded today in Yangzhou, Jiangsu.

In the women's competition across 9 weight classes, 40 athletes broke 19 world records. Except for the first two lighter weight classes, the remaining 7 classes all saw world records being surpassed.

Experts believe that these results have elevated the performance of most weight classes in Chinese women's weightlifting to new heights, demonstrating the continuous development of this sport in China.

In contrast, the men's competition across 10 weight classes did not see the same record-breaking enthusiasm as the women's. The established order remained unchanged, with Guangdong, Guangxi, Hebei, Sichuan, and the PLA team still holding significant strength, dividing most of the 30 gold medals among them. Beijing and Tianjin teams showed improvement, each winning 3 gold medals. No weight class in the men's competition surpassed the national record, with the best results generally 5 kilograms below the national record and 15 kilograms below the world record. The heavier weight classes remain a weak point for Chinese men's weightlifting. Additionally, apart from Liu Shoubin from Sichuan, no other promising young athletes were discovered. Head coach of the national weightlifting team, Zhao Qingkui, stated that addressing the crisis in the reserve talent pool is a key task for the weightlifting community moving forward.

    全国举重冠军赛喜忧参半
    女强男弱　反差鲜明
    本报扬州10月14日电　有29个省、市、自治区和解放军、银鹰体协等35个单位、450多名男女运动员参加的全国举重冠军赛，今天在江苏扬州结束。
    在女子组9个级别比赛中，共有40人次超19项世界纪录。除前两个轻级别外，其余7个级别世界纪录均被超过。
    行家们认为，这些成绩的取得，把我国女子举重大多数级别的成绩提到新高度，显示出我国女子举重项目不断发展的好势头。
    在男子组10个级别比赛中，没有出现女子组争破纪录的喜人景象，形成鲜明反差。而且，过去形成的格局未有突破，广东、广西、河北、四川、解放军队仍然具有实力，10个级别30块金牌多数被他们瓜分。北京、天津队有所提高，分别夺得3枚金牌。这次比赛男子组没有一个级别的成绩超过全国纪录，其最好成绩与全国纪录一般相差5公斤以上，与世界纪录相差15公斤以上。大级别比赛还是我国男子举重的薄弱环节。另外，除四川队刘寿斌外，尚未发现有前途的年轻选手。国家举重队总教练赵庆奎说，解决后备力量危机是举重界今后的重点任务。　（谢春明）
