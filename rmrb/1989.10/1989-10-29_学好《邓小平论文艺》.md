The publication of the book "Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art" is a significant event in China's ideological and cultural circles and the publishing industry after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. It is a victory achieved after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee put an end to the control and interference of Zhao Ziyang and his advisors over the ideological and cultural front. In the current situation, I believe that doing a good job in the distribution and promotion of this book, especially organizing the study of this book, should be an important task for our ideological and cultural front, especially the literary and artistic front.

This book provides us with an outstanding example of how Chinese Marxists, represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, correctly adhere to, apply, and develop Marxist literary and artistic theories and Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art in the new historical period. Studying this book well is of great practical significance and far-reaching historical significance for us to review and reflect on the path of cultural work over the past 40 years since liberation, especially in the past decade; to comprehensively summarize the positive and negative experiences of opposing both "leftist" and rightist tendencies; to clarify the confused ideological and theoretical issues caused by bourgeois liberalization; to correctly adhere to, improve, and effectively implement the party and state's policies and guidelines for literature and art; to promote the healthy development and greater prosperity of literary and artistic work; and to build a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping, based on the basic principles, standpoints, and methods of Marxism, in light of China's national conditions, and in conjunction with the new situations, problems, and requirements of the new period, as well as the new realities of the cultural and artistic front over the past decade, has made a series of new summaries and new judgments.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We will continue to adhere to the direction of serving the broadest masses of the people, especially the workers, peasants, and soldiers, as proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and adhere to the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, pushing out the old and bringing in the new, making foreign things serve China, and making the past serve the present." Around this overall direction and policy, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made a series of concise and new judgments and put forward new requirements. For example:

* On the judgment that "the people are the mother of literary and artistic workers" and "the people need art, and art needs the people even more";
* On the judgment that "we should not continue to raise the slogan of literature and art being subordinate to politics," but "this does not mean that literature and art can be separated from politics. Literature and art cannot be separated from politics";
* On the judgment that "artists often progress and improve by humbly listening to criticism from all sides and accepting beneficial opinions";
* On the requirement that "all levels of party committees should lead literary and artistic work well" and "adhere to party leadership and improve party leadership";
* On the requirement that literary and artistic workers should "seriously consider the social effects of their works and strive to contribute the best spiritual food to the people";
* On the requirement to fully respect the laws of art and that "what to write and how to write can only be explored and gradually solved by artists in artistic practice. In this regard, do not interfere arbitrarily";
* On the requirement to "oppose both 'leftist' and rightist tendencies" on the ideological and political front and the literary and artistic front. And so on.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping's judgments and discussions on these series of issues are highly scientific and have clear practical significance. In the new historical conditions, they have clearly adhered to and creatively developed Marxist literary and artistic theories and Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art, becoming a new part of Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art.

It should be particularly pointed out that as the main designer of the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and the main advocate of ideological emancipation, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, while promoting reform and opening up, clearly proposed in March 1979 to adhere to the four cardinal principles, focusing on criticizing the trend of doubting and opposing the four cardinal principles from the right. This laid the foundation for determining the party's basic line with "one center and two basic points" as the main content. In 1980, Comrade Xiaoping further proposed to oppose the trend of bourgeois liberalization. Since then, Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly sounded the alarm, sharply pointing out the seriousness and harm of the spread and rampancy of bourgeois liberalization. The practice of the past decade has proven that this is a major principle issue on the ideological and political front, a matter related to the fate of the country; it is also a major issue that decides the nature, direction, path, and fate of culture and literature and art. And this issue is something that Marxist literary and artistic theories and Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art must first pay attention to at any time. Because the two general secretaries of the party, especially Comrade Zhao Ziyang, went against Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions and criticisms, adopted an attitude of indulgence and support towards bourgeois liberalization, lost many important Marxist ideological positions and literary and artistic positions, allowed the stubborn bourgeois liberalization political "elites" and cultural "elites" to rampage on the political and literary stages, resulting in the serious political turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion of this spring and summer.

This heart-rending lesson of blood and fire tells us: Adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization is not unrelated to literature and art, but is closely related. Literature and art cannot be separated from politics. The fate of the literary and artistic cause and the personal fate of literary and artistic workers are absolutely inseparable from the fate of the country. The fate of our country and people cannot be separated from adhering to the four cardinal principles, and our socialist literature and art cannot be separated from the guidance of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we especially cherish Comrade Deng Xiaoping's summation of the experience of practice in the new period, adhering to and developing Mao Zedong Thought's literary and artistic discourse, and fully recognize the great significance of re-learning these discourses, which is quite natural.

Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a scientific theory that has been tested by ten years of practice and recognized and accepted by hundreds of millions of people, and is the banner guiding us to continue to advance." Comrade Xiaoping's discourse on literature and art is an organic part of his theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and is the banner guiding us to continue to advance and develop socialist literature and art with Chinese characteristics. We are facing a long-term struggle of infiltration and counter-infiltration, subversion and counter-subversion, peaceful evolution and counter-peaceful evolution. Comrade Xiaoping's thoughts on literature and art are a powerful ideological weapon for the cultural front to counter infiltration, subversion, and peaceful evolution.

For this reason, I also want to say that I believe the publication of this book will definitely be welcomed by the broad masses of comrades and friends in the cultural and artistic circles, and I also believe that after calm reflection, the vast majority of comrades will adopt a correct attitude towards learning, fully and accurately understand its spiritual essence, rather than avoiding the light of truth and distorting individual words and phrases for personal biases.

Finally, let me return to what I said earlier, we must study this book well, combine it with reality, summarize experiences, clarify the confused theoretical issues caused by bourgeois liberalization, correctly adhere to, improve, and effectively implement the party and state's policies and guidelines for literature and art, and take new steps to build a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics.

　　学好《邓小平论文艺》
　　贺敬之
    《邓小平论文艺》一书的出版，是平息反革命暴乱后，我国思想文化界和出版界的一件大事，是党的十三届四中全会结束了赵紫阳同志及其谋士对思想文化战线的控制和干扰后的一个胜利成果。在当前形势下，我认为：做好这本书的发行工作和宣传工作，特别是组织好对这本书的学习，应当是我们思想文化战线，尤其是文艺战线的一项重要任务。
    这本书向我们提供的是，以邓小平同志为代表的中国的马克思主义者在新的历史时期，正确地坚持、运用和发展马克思主义文艺理论和毛泽东文艺思想的一个突出的范例。学好这本书，对于我们回顾和反思解放40年来，特别是近十年来文化工作走过的道路，全面地总结正面和反面，反“左”和反右的经验教训；澄清被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的思想是非、理论是非；对于我们正确地坚持、完善和有效地贯彻党和国家的文艺方针和路线，促进文艺工作的健康发展与更大繁荣，建设有中国特色的社会主义文化，有着极其重要的现实意义和深远的历史意义。
    邓小平同志根据马克思主义的基本原理和立场、观点、方法，针对中国的国情，结合新时期的新情况、新问题、新要求，结合文化艺术战线十年来的新的实际，做出了一系列新的概括和新的论断。
    邓小平同志指出：“我们要继续坚持毛泽东同志提出的文艺为最广大的人民群众、首先是为工农兵服务的方向，坚持百花齐放、推陈出新、洋为中用、古为今用的方针”。围绕这个总的方向和方针，邓小平同志作出了一系列言简意赅的新论断，提出了新要求。例如：
    关于“人民是文艺工作者的母亲”、“人民需要艺术，艺术更需要人民”的论断；
    关于“不继续提文艺从属于政治这样的口号”，“但是，这当然不是说文艺可以脱离政治。文艺是不可能脱离政治的”的论断；
    关于“虚心倾听各方面的批评，接受有益的意见，常常是艺术家不断进步、不断提高的动力”的论断；
    关于“各级党委都要领导好文艺工作”、要“坚持党的领导，改善党的领导”的要求；
    关于文艺工作者应当“认真严肃地考虑自己作品的社会效果，力求把最好的精神食粮贡献给人民”的要求；
    关于要充分尊重艺术规律，对作家“写什么和怎样写，只能由文艺家在艺术实践中去探索和逐步求得解决。在这方面，不要横加干涉”的要求；
    关于在政治思想战线和文艺战线“既要反‘左’，又要反右”的要求。等等，等等。
    邓小平同志对这一系列问题的论断和论述具有高度的科学性和鲜明的现实性。在新的历史条件下，旗帜鲜明地坚持和创造性地发展了马克思主义文艺理论和毛泽东文艺思想，是毛泽东文艺思想的新的组成部分。
    应该特别指出的是，作为党的十一届三中全会路线的主要设计者和思想解放的主要倡导者的邓小平同志，在推动改革开放的同时，于1979年3月明确地提出了坚持四项基本原则，着重对“从右的方面来怀疑和反对四项原则的思潮”进行了批判，为确定以“一个中心、两个基本点”为主要内容的党的基本路线奠定了基础。1980年，小平同志进一步提出了要反对资产阶级自由化倾向。此后，小平同志一而再再而三地敲起警钟，尖锐地指出资产阶级自由化思潮的传播和泛滥的严重性与危害性。十年来的实践证明，这是政治思想战线的重大原则问题，是关系到国家前途和命运的问题；同时也是决定文化和文艺的性质、方向、道路和前途命运的大问题。而这个问题在任何时候都是马克思主义文艺理论和毛泽东文艺思想不能不首先重视的问题。由于党的两任总书记，特别是赵紫阳同志对邓小平同志的指示和批评反其道而行之，对资产阶级自由化采取纵容、支持的态度，丧失了许多重要的马克思主义的思想阵地和文艺阵地，让顽固地搞资产阶级自由化的政治“精英”和文化“精英”们猖獗于政坛和文坛，以致酿成了今年春夏之交的这场严重的政治动乱和反革命暴乱。
    这场惊心动魄的血与火的教训告诉我们：坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化不是与文艺无关，而是密切相关的。文艺是不能脱离政治的。文艺事业和文艺工作者的个人命运与国家的前途命运是绝对分不开的。我们国家和人民的前途命运离不开坚持四项基本原则，我们的社会主义文艺离不开马克思主义毛泽东思想的指导。为此，我们对邓小平同志总结了新时期实践经验，坚持和发展毛泽东思想的文艺论述特别珍视，充分估计到重新学习这些论述的重大意义，这是理所当然的。
    江泽民同志指出：“邓小平同志关于建设有中国特色社会主义的理论，是经过十年实践检验而为亿万人民认识和接受的科学理论，是指引我们继续前进的旗帜。”小平同志对文艺的论述是他的建设有中国特色的社会主义理论的有机组成部分，是指引我们文化事业继续前进、发展有中国特色的社会主义文艺的旗帜。我们面临着渗透与反渗透、颠覆与反颠覆、和平演变与反和平演变的长期斗争，小平同志的文艺思想，就是文化战线反渗透、反颠覆、反和平演变的有力思想武器。
    正因为如此，我还想说，我相信这本书的出版一定会受到文化艺术界广大同志和朋友们的欢迎，我也相信经过冷静地回顾和反思绝大多数同志会采取正确的学习态度，全面地、准确地理解它的精神实质，而不是避开真理的光芒，曲解只言片语以为个人偏见所用。
    最后，让我再回到前面说过的话，我们要学好这本书，联系实际，总结经验，澄清被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的理论是非，正确地坚持、完善和有效地贯彻党和国家的文艺方针和路线，为建设有中国特色的社会主义文化迈出新的步伐。
