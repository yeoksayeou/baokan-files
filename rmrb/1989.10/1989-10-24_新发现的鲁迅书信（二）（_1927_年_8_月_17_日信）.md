Newly Discovered Letters of Lu Xun (Part II)
(Letter dated August 17, 1927)

Dear Mr. Shao Yuan,

I previously sent a few letters, which I believe you have received. I can't recall the details, but I remember one of them contained a passage from an ancient book about growing sesame.

A long time ago, I received a letter from Mr. Wang Fucuan, asking me to write an article and a preface for his book. He mentioned that after completion, he could request you to forward it. The article is yet to be written, but I am sending the preface for you to forward. It is quite amusing and regrettable that such a person could write a preface. Recently, I also wrote a small horizontal scroll. Such matters are hard to come by unless one goes to Guangdong.

The news reports that Jian Xian has arrived in Hong Kong, but I do not know why. Perhaps he is traveling aimlessly?

Recently, I have been busy for a few days due to the closure of the bookstore. I could have left, but the Taikoo Company has no ships, and taking a mail ship is inconvenient due to the luggage. Taking a cargo ship is too harsh, so I am still waiting. In short, as soon as there is a suitable ship, I will leave. However, the date is still uncertain.

The weather seems to be hotter than before. I often sit in the west window, so I have developed small bumps all over my body. Although there is no danger to my life, it is quite troublesome. The situation is changing rapidly, and I am not sure if Zhongda University can maintain its current state. I suspect it may not be able to.

Support Jia (Li Jishen) said that politics is not his forte, and education is immature. He finally decided to "focus on education" and adopt a "leisurely attitude," probably due to this reason.

Yours sincerely,
Lu Xun
August 17, 1927

Notes:
(1) Wang Fucuan (1899–1959), from Hang County, Zhejiang (now Yuhang County). In 1927, he was the editor of the South Seas Daily in Medan, Sumatra, Indonesia, and requested Lu Xun to write a preface for his book "Coconut Collection." However, this book was never published. In the 1930s, he served as a professor at Fudan University and later became a cultural traitor during the war of resistance.

(2) Bookstore: Refers to Beixin Bookstore, a retail outlet in Guangzhou for Beixin Publishing House and Wuming Society books, managed by Xu Yueping. Before leaving Guangzhou, Lu Xun spent a few days transferring all the remaining books to the Republican Bookstore.

(3) I suspect that Zhongda University may not be able to maintain its current state: At that time, the political situation at Zhongda University was complex. Before the April 12 counter-revolutionary coup, there were conflicts and struggles between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Afterward, there were internal conflicts within the Kuomintang and between local and outsider factions. For example, the new warlord Zhang Fakui of the Hunanese faction of Wang Jingwei went to Zhongda University to give a speech, while the Kuomintang faction's school principal Dai Jitao and vice-principal Zhu Jiahuo, both from Zhejiang, avoided seeing him by going to Hong Kong. Lu Xun was aware of the internal situation at Zhongda University, hence his statement, "I suspect (the second half of the year) may not be able to maintain the current state."

(4) Support Jia: Refers to Li Jishen. See the note for the letter dated July 12, 1927.

(5) "Focus on education" and adopt a "leisurely attitude": See the letter to Zhang Tingqian in Volume 11 of "Complete Works of Lu Xun," page 570.

Appendix: Double Joy of Finding Hidden Gems from the Sea
— Rediscovering Two Lost Letters of Lu Xun

Zhang Ting, Jiang Xiaohui

Last year, while following the instructions to handle my father Jiang Shao Yuan's books, Xiaohui discovered a lost letter from Lu Xun and wrote a short article along with Lu Xun's handwriting, which was published in the 10th issue of "Lu Xun Research Dynamics" in 1988 and later in "People's Daily," attracting the attention of Lu Xun researchers both at home and abroad. During the Spring Festival this year, while on vacation in Beijing, we found these two letters, which are mentioned in Lu Xun's diary but not included in his letter collection, among the several thousand books that have not yet been sorted. We were overjoyed!

These two letters were written in Guangzhou after the April 12 counter-revolutionary coup in 1927, and their importance in studying the development of Lu Xun's thoughts is self-evident. From these short letters, we can already see Lu Xun's lofty spiritual world! First is his revolutionary fearlessness. In the white terror after the April 12 counter-revolutionary coup, Lu Xun stood like a towering tree in a storm, giving lectures as usual, and even lecturing on "The Spirit of Wei and Jin and the Relationship Between Literature, Medicine, and Alcohol." As Lu Xun later said, "In Guangzhou, I spoke about the Wei and Jin period, which was indeed a lament" (see the letter to Chen Jun on December 30, 1928). This indirectly exposed and satirized the Kuomintang reactionaries. This reminds us of Lu Xun's fearlessness in the "Postscript to the Preface of Tang and Song Tales": "At this time, the night was vast, the moon was bright, the mosquitoes sighed in the distance, and I was in Guangzhou." But he did not "fight bare-chested," instead adopting a "trench warfare" strategy. Secondly, Lu Xun's insight. From these two letters, we can see that he had a clear understanding of the complex factional struggles within Zhongda University and the Kuomintang, as well as the complex attitudes of intellectuals. As for his concern and support for his juniors—such as Jiang Shao Yuan and Wang Fucuan (Wang's later betrayal is another matter)—in academics and careers, it is Lu Xun's consistent spirit, which needs no further elaboration.

Cultural heritage is a world treasure, and we dare not keep it secret. We attach a few words and hand over these two lost letters along with Lu Xun's handwriting of the letter dated August 17, 1927, to the "Dadi" supplement for publication. On one hand, it is to commemorate the 53rd anniversary of Lu Xun's death, and on the other hand, it is to provide this precious original material to Lu Xun researchers at home and abroad for reference.

### 新发现的鲁迅书信（二）（1927年8月17日信）

　　新发现的鲁迅书信（二）
　　（1927年8月17日信）
　　绍原先生：
　　先前寄过几封信，想已到。细目记不清了，只记得有一封是抄一段关于种胡麻的古书的。
    很久以前，得汪馥泉（1）先生来信，要我作一篇文章和写了一个书面，且云成后可请先生转寄。文章之做，尚未有期，但将书面寄上，乞转寄为荷。如此之字而可写书面，真是可笑可叹。我新近还写了一幅小中堂，此种事非到广东盖不易遇也。
    报载骝先到香港，不知何也，大约是漫游欤？
    近来因结束书店（2），忙了几天。本可走了，而太古公司无船，坐邮船嫌行李多，坐货船太苦，所以还在观望；总之：一有相宜之船，便当走耳。但日期还说不定。
    天气似乎比先前热了，我因常晒在西窗下，所以已经弄得满身小疙瘩，虽无性命之忧，而亦颇以为窘也。变化繁多，中大下半年不知如何，我疑心未必能维持现状（3）。
    支持家（4）评留先云，政治非其所长，教育幼稚。其终于“专心办学”而取“优游态度”者（5），大约即因此之故。
                                              迅上八，十七．
    注释：（1）汪馥泉（1899——1959），浙江杭县（今余杭县）人。1927年时在印尼苏门答腊棉兰任南洋日报编辑，函请鲁迅为其所著《椰子集》题签并作序。但此书后来并未出版。汪于30年代曾任复旦大学教授；抗战后堕落为文化汉奸。
      （2）书店：指北新书屋。是鲁迅在广州筹办的代售北新书局和未名社书籍的门市部；工作人员为许月平。鲁迅离开广州前，为将北新书屋存书全部转让给共和书局忙了几天。
      （3）中大下半年不知如何，我疑心未必能维持现状：当时中大政治情况复杂。“四·一二”反革命政变之前是国共之间的矛盾和斗争；之后，是国民党内部派系和本地人与外省人之间的矛盾和斗争。例如汪精卫派的广东籍新军阀张发奎去中大讲演，蒋介石系的浙江籍的中大校长戴季陶、副校长朱家骅皆借故去港，避而不见。鲁迅洞悉中大内情，故说“我疑心
  （下半年）未必能维持现状”。
      （4）支持家：指李济深。见1927年7月12日信注（8）。
    （5）“专心办学”而取“优游态度”：参见《鲁迅全集》第11卷570页致章廷谦信。

    附记：沧海遗珠喜获双
    ——再次发现鲁迅佚信两封
    张挺　江小蕙
    去年小蕙在遵照遗命处理父亲江绍原的藏书时，曾发现鲁迅先生的一封佚信，并写了一篇短文连同鲁迅先生墨迹一起发表在《鲁迅研究动态》1988年第10期上，复经《人民日报》发表，颇引起海内外鲁迅研究工作者的注意。今年春节在京度假期间，我们又在尚未处理完毕的几千册书中发现了这两封见于鲁迅日记记载却不见于鲁迅书信集的佚信，不禁为之雀跃者再！
    这两封信恰是写于1927年“四·一二”反革命政变之后的广州，在研究鲁迅思想发展中的重要性不言而喻。从这短短的两封信中已可概言鲁迅的崇高的精神世界！首先是革命的大无畏精神。在“四·一二”反革命政变后的白色恐怖中，鲁迅如暴风雨中的参天大树，巍然屹立，照样出去演讲，而且讲的是
  《魏晋风度及文章与药及酒之关系》；正如鲁迅后来所说，“在广州之谈魏晋事，盖实有慨而言”（见1928年12月30日致陈浚信）。——曲折地对国民党反动派进行了揭露和讽刺。这使我们联想起鲁迅在《唐宋传奇集·序例》的校毕题记中所表现的同样大无畏精神：“时大夜弥天，璧月澄照，饕蚊遥叹，余在广州。”但他决不“赤膊上阵”，而是采取“壕堑战术”。其次是鲁迅的洞察力。从这两封信中可以看出，他对中山大学和国民党内部的复杂的派系斗争以及知识分子的复杂心态，可以说是洞若观火！至于对后辈——如江绍原、汪馥泉
  （汪后投敌是另一回事）在学术上和事业上的关怀与扶持，更是鲁迅的一贯精神，无庸赘言。
    文化遗产，举世之珍，不敢自秘；特缀数语，将两封佚信连同鲁迅先生1927年8月17日信的手迹一并交《大地》副刊发表。一方面用以纪念鲁迅先生逝世53周年，一方面作为珍贵的原始资料提供给海内外鲁迅研究工作者参考。
                                1989、8、19、于青岛
