In today's Western world, many countries (especially Western European countries) are deeply concerned about the "football hooligans" that frequently appear in their own countries. Including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the leaders of various Western European countries have designed various measures from issuing fan ID cards to severely punishing "football hooligans," but it seems to have little effect. Currently, there are signs that the violent behavior of "football hooligans" in Western European countries is not only not subsiding but also shows a tendency to escalate. For example, this summer, British and Swedish "football hooligans" caused trouble again in the Swedish capital, not only fighting each other but also looting stores, attacking riot police, and knocking down pedestrians. The Swedish government eventually had to deploy a large number of military police to stop the situation from escalating further. In addition, there are signs that "football hooligans" in various Western European countries have a tendency to form "transnational organizations." British "football hooligan" organizations often communicate with similar organizations in the Netherlands, West Germany, and Sweden, and even collude and cause trouble together on the field.

The outrageous behavior of "football hooligans" has filled the hearts of the majority of fans with indignation and has also attracted the attention of sociologists, psychologists, and criminologists in various countries to this "new violent group." Recently, several British newspapers have heatedly discussed the "birth" of "football hooligans."

Renowned sociologist Dr. Watson analyzed that the "birth" of "football hooligans" is completely related to various social factors. He believes that the increasing unemployment rate in Britain, the collapse of the spiritual pillar of the younger generation, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor are all social phenomena that may cause some people with extreme thoughts (especially young people) to have strong dissatisfaction with society, and the football field is just a place for them to vent their dissatisfaction or anger. In other words, these people, if in other situations, will also become anti-social violent criminals (such as robbers, rapists, murderers, arsonists, etc.).

Sports psychologist Professor Dunning advocates reducing the overly intense competitive consciousness of football matches to eliminate the "spiritual breeding ground" for the birth of "football hooligans." He pointed out that football is originally a very competitive sport, but in recent years, under the intentional or unintentional incitement of some people, winning or losing has become the top priority on the football field, so the atmosphere between players, between spectators, and between spectators and players is often very tense, sometimes even to the point of being "ready to explode." From this, he suggested that sportsmen and sports fans should "update" their sports concepts and advocate an atmosphere of "equality, friendship, and understanding" in sports competitions. He also emphasized that in the case of British "football hooligans," most of them are young men in their twenties, who are not politically mature, and narrow nationalist views (such as determining that losing is equivalent to "national disgrace") are often used by extreme right-wing groups, violent organizations, and racist elements, and even some "football hooligan" organizations have been manipulated by extremist groups.

Criminologist Leiber's "composition survey" of more than 200 "football hooligans" also confirmed that more than half of them are illiterate or semi-illiterate, about 70% have no fixed job or low income, and a certain proportion of them come from "broken homes" due to the lack of complete and sufficient parental love, making their psychology abnormal.

　　“足球流氓”是如何产生的
　　胡长风
    在今日西方世界，不少国家（尤其是西欧国家）的政府都对国内“层出不穷”的“足球流氓”忧心忡忡。包括英国首相撒切尔夫人在内的西欧各国首脑曾设计了从发放球迷身份证到从严惩处“足球流氓”的种种办法，然而似乎并无明显效果。眼下有迹象显示，西欧各国“足球流氓”的暴力行为不仅不见收敛，反而有逐步升级的苗头。如，今年夏天，英国与瑞典的“足球流氓”在瑞典首都又一次闹事，双方不但大打出手，而且抢劫商店、袭击防暴警察、撞倒过路行人。瑞典政府最后不得不出动大批军警，才制止了事态的继续扩展。此外，还有迹象显示，西欧各国的“足球流氓”似有建立“跨国组织”的倾向，英国的“足球流氓”组织就常常与荷兰、西德、瑞典的类似组织取得联系，甚至在赛场上狼狈为奸、合伙闹事。
      “足球流氓”的倒行逆施使广大球迷义愤填胸，也使各国社会学家、心理学家和犯罪学家对这一“新生暴力集团”日益关注。最近，几家英国报刊就以“足球流氓”的“生成”展开了热烈讨论。
    著名社会学家华森博士分析说，“足球流氓”的“诞生”完全与诸多社会因素“息息相关”。他认为英国失业率的与年俱增、年青一代“精神支柱”的坍落、愈拉愈大的贫富不均等社会现象都可能促使有些思想偏激的人（尤其是年青人）对社会产生强烈不满，而绿茵场只是充当了他们宣泄不满或愤怒情绪的“出气洞”。换句话说，这些人如在另外一些场合，同样会沦为反社会的暴力分子（如抢劫犯、强奸犯、杀人犯、纵火犯等）。
    体育心理学家唐宁教授则主张以淡化足球比赛的过分激烈的竞争意识来铲除“足球流氓”诞生的“精神温床”，他指出，足球运动本来就是对抗十分激烈的运动项目，而近来在一些人有意或无意的鼓动下，比赛输赢成了绿茵场上“压倒一切”的头等大事，因而比赛时队员之间、观众之间、观众与队员之间的气氛往往十分紧张，有时甚至到了“一触即发”的地步。由此他建议体育家和体育迷们应“更新”体育观念，在体育比赛中提倡一种“平等、友好、谅解”的氛围。他还强调，就英国的“足球流氓”而言，其中大多为二十来岁的男性青年，他们在政治上并不成熟，狭隘的民族主义观（如断定输球无异于“国耻”）往往受极右集团、暴力组织、种族主义分子的利用，甚至有的“足球流氓”组织已被极端分子集团操纵。
    而犯罪学家莱勃肯对二百余名“足球流氓”进行的“成份调查”也证实，他们中有半数以上为文盲或半文盲，有百分之七十左右的无固定职业或收入偏低，有一定比例的人出生于父母离异的“半边家庭”因而由于缺乏完整、充分的双亲之爱而心理变得畸型……
