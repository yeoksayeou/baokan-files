After the October 1973 Middle East War, the Syrian government decided to implement military training for college and university students to strengthen national defense. Over the past 16 years, the Syrian university military training camps have trained batch after batch of students, playing an active role in cultivating the talents needed by the country.

To ensure the success of military training, each college and university has established a student military training center and several permanent military training camps. The training camps provide necessary facilities and conditions for students' accommodation, military training, political education, cultural and technological education, and cultural and sports activities. Military instructors are responsible for most of the work in the student military training camps. The Military Training Command Center of Damascus University has six military training camps, two of which are independently established, while the other four are located in military camps where students live and train with soldiers.

The Syrian government stipulates that college students must undergo 21 days of training each year. Male students attend military training camps, while female students attend production training camps. Students from liberal arts colleges are arranged by the university military training center to participate in winter or summer training camps. Students from science and engineering colleges, who have difficulty concentrating on training, can train one day per week. Each training session is conducted according to the training outline formulated by the military training center. Training courses include physical exercise, military shooting, unarmed combat, night marches, field cooking in wartime, and wartime first aid. Science and engineering students are arranged according to their majors to train in various technical forces or arms factories. Medical students participate in medical military training camps, where they receive military training while providing medical services to society. Political education courses include patriotism education, situation education, and political dialogue. Each training session features reports by party, government, and military leaders, who introduce domestic and international situations, government policies, and national tasks. Party, government, and military leaders also hold discussions with students to answer their questions.

In Syria, the annual military training for university students complements classroom education, not only enhancing students' sense of organization and discipline and work ethic but also fostering their love for the motherland and desire to serve it.

    热爱祖国　报效祖国
    ——记叙利亚大学生军训工作
    孙学斌
    1973年10月中东战争以后，叙利亚政府为加强战备，决定对大专院校学生实行军事训练。16年来，叙利亚大学军训营锻炼了一批又一批学生，为培养国家需要的人材发挥了积极的作用。
    为了搞好军训工作，各大专院校均设立了大学生军事训练中心，还建立了若干常设军事训练营。军训营为大学生膳宿、军事训练、政治教育、文化科技教育及文体活动提供了必要的设施和条件。部队教官负责大学生军训营的大部分工作。大马士革大学军训指挥中心下属的六个军事训练营有两个营单独设立，其余四个营分别设在武装部队营地，大学生与部队战士同吃同住同训练。
    叙利亚政府规定，在校大学生每年参加训练21天，男生参加军事训练营，女生参加生产训练营。文科院校学生由大学军训中心统筹安排参加冬季训练营或夏季训练营。理工科院校学生集中训练有困难，可每周训练1天。每期军训，根据军训中心制定的军训大纲进行。训练课程包括体育锻炼、军事射击、徒手搏斗、夜行军、战时野炊、战时救护等。理工科生根据专业安排在各技术兵种或兵工厂训练。医科生参加医疗军训营，学生一边参加军训，一边为社会医疗服务。政治教育课包括爱国主义教育、形势教育及政治对话。每期军训由党政军负责人做报告，介绍国内外形势、政府内外政策以及全国面临的任务。党政军负责人还与学生座谈，解答提出的问题。
    在叙利亚，一年一度的大学生军事训练弥补了大学课堂教育之不足，不仅提高了学生的组织纪律观念、劳动观念，而且培养了学生热爱祖国、报效祖国的思想。
