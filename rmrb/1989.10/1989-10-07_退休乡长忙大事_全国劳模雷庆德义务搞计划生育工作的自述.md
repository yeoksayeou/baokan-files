I am Lei Qingde, the vice-chairman of the Family Planning Association of Xiaojiang Township, Qiyang County, Hunan Province. I am 63 years old. In the past, I served as the chairman of the township agricultural cooperative, the township head, and the township party committee secretary. Before retiring in 1980, I worked at the Seventh Company of the Provincial Construction Company. In March 1987, everyone elected me to my current position. I think that although I have retired from my official position, I cannot retire from fighting for the party's cause for life. My health is still good, and I want to do a few practical things for the basic state policy of family planning in my remaining years.

Patience and Guidance – Difficulties Are Not Difficult

One day in May 1987, I went to the township to attend a meeting of the standing committee of the Family Planning Association. During the meeting, when analyzing the family planning situation in the entire township, everyone felt that the most difficult village was Yantangchong. This village had more than 50 couples of childbearing age who had not implemented birth control measures. In September 1986, the township government organized a team of 103 people, who stayed for 7 days and spent more than 2,000 yuan, but the problem was not solved. I said, "I'll give it a try."

I went to Yantangchong Village and first found a few "old agricultural cooperatives" from the 1950s who had worked with me on land reform to chat and gather information. Old Madame Chen Cuilin was happy to see me and asked, "Old Township Head, it's been a long time. What brings you here?" I said, "I wouldn't come without a reason. I heard that some people in your village are unwilling to practice family planning." "Family planning is a state policy; who says they are unwilling?" "Can you help me?" "Old Township Head, you think highly of me, I won't drag my feet." "I heard your daughter-in-law is pregnant again?" She thought for a while and said, "I'm not too sure, but if she is really pregnant, my husband and I will take care of it. I guarantee that she will go for an abortion tomorrow." I slapped my hand and said, "Good, let's see the action!" Then I found the old team leader Tang Shichang and told him that we, the activists from the land reform days, should not fall behind in family planning and should set an example. The next day, he and his wife also sent their daughter-in-law to the hospital for a sterilization operation. After that, these old comrades worked with me to do ideological work for others. I seized this good momentum, and with the village committee, we held a mobilization meeting and showed a movie. On one hand, we praised the leading role of the "old agricultural cooperatives," and on the other hand, we used this opportunity to publicize family planning policies and conduct a cost comparison of "having children, but the land does not produce children." Then we went door-to-door to do work. This way, those who used to hide when they saw the family planning team coming back to the village were called back by their families with letters or telegrams. In just about 10 days, 48 birth control subjects went to the hospital for surgery. After completing the task, the villagers not only had no objections but also set off firecrackers to see me off, thanking me for helping them remove the backward hat.

Relieving Worries and Solving Problems – Warm-hearted Service

In practice, I have come to realize that combining ideological work with solving the actual problems of the masses is very important. Currently, some family planning subjects are "stubborn," apart from the fact that propaganda and education work is not done well, an important reason is that we care too little about them.

Last April, I learned that Chen Changnian, a birth control subject in Linchang Village, was unwilling to undergo a sterilization operation because his actual difficulties had not been solved. I suggested that the village party branch lend him 100 yuan to buy grain and fertilizer, and discussed with his team leader to arrange labor to transplant his seedlings on time. For this, Chen Changnian was so moved that he cried, "I used to think you were doing the work of cutting off descendants, but now I see that you are wholeheartedly doing good things."

In my usual visits, I found that whoever had difficulties in production and life, I would try my best to help. Over the past two years, I have taken out several hundred yuan and more than a thousand pounds of grain from my limited retirement salary to lend to birth control subjects, and for those in difficulty, I just gave it away. In the past two years, I have also personally accompanied more than 50 young people of childbearing age to the county technical station for sterilization operations, and each time I arranged for their food and accommodation before leaving. These things are not big, and they are not spectacular, but people's hearts are made of flesh, and over time, the relationship between the masses and me has become increasingly close.

Treating Everyone Equally – Leading by Example

"Shouting won't work, but setting an example will." I have one son and three daughters. My son has only one daughter, and I persuaded him to obtain a one-child certificate. My eldest daughter, after marrying late and giving birth late, also had a daughter, and I also asked them to obtain a one-child certificate. My wife's thoughts were not clear, and my mother-in-law wanted to have a grandson, and my eldest daughter was really pregnant again. My wife advised me, "Don't interfere with this matter, lest it offend the in-laws." I said, Communist Party members cannot just do ideological work for others and require others to practice family planning; they should set an example and treat their families the same as the masses. Through family meetings and individual talks, we finally got the old and young of both families to understand. My wife personally accompanied her daughter to have an abortion and obtained a one-child certificate. My third daughter's boyfriend also agreed to my suggestion of "establishing a career first and then getting married, marrying late and giving birth late," and postponed the wedding. In addition, I persuaded six relatives and friends to implement birth control measures and obtain one-child certificates.

Now, under my and my relatives' influence, all those who should implement birth control measures in our place have done so. Last year, our village's natural population growth rate continued to decline and entered the advanced ranks.

    退休乡长忙大事
    ——全国劳模雷庆德义务搞计划生育工作的自述
    我叫雷庆德，是湖南省祁阳县狭江乡计划生育协会副会长，今年63岁。过去担任过乡农协主席、乡长、乡党委书记。1980年退休前在省建筑公司七公司工作。1987年3月，大家推选我担任了现在的差事。我想，虽然职务上退了休，但为党的事业奋斗终身是不能退休的。我身体还好，要在有生之年为计划生育这项基本国策做几件实实在在的事情。
    耐心疏导　难事不难
    1987年5月的一天，我去乡里参加计划生育协会常务理事会。会上分析全乡的计划生育形势时，大家感到最棘手的是岩塘冲村。这个村有50多对育龄夫妇没有落实节育措施，1986年9月乡政府曾组织了103人的工作队，去了7天，花了2000多元，都没解决问题。我说，我去试试。
    我到了岩塘冲村，先找了几位50年代和我一起搞土改闹翻身的“老农会”谈心摸情况。陈翠林老大娘见了我高兴地问：“老乡长，多年不见，什么风把你吹来了？”我说：“无事不登三宝殿。听说你们村里有些人不愿搞计划生育？”“计划生育是国策，哪个说不愿意？”“你能帮帮我吗？”“老乡长看得起我，我不拖后腿。”“听说你媳妇又怀孕了？”她想了一会说：“我还不太清楚，如果真的又怀了，这个工作由我老两口来做。保证明天就送她去引产。”我把手一拍：“好，就看行动了！”紧接着我找了老队长唐时昌，我对他说，我们这些土改时的积极分子，现在搞计划生育也不能落后，要起模范带头作用。第二天他和老伴也把自己的媳妇送到医院做了节育手术。此后，这些老同志就和我一块儿做别人的思想工作。我抓住这个好势头，与村支部研究开了个动员大会，放了场电影。一方面表扬“老农会”的带头作用，另一方面利用这个机会宣传计划生育政策，开展“人生崽，地不生崽”的算账对比，随后又挨家挨户去做工作。这样一来，原来见计划生育工作队一进村就躲到外面的人，都被家属写信或打电报招回来了。仅10来天，就有48名节育对象到医院做了手术。任务完成后，村里的群众不仅没有意见，还放鞭炮欢送我，感谢帮他们摘掉后进帽子。
    排忧解难　热情服务
    在实践中，我体会把思想工作同解决群众实际问题结合起来很要紧。当前，少数计划生育对象“顶牛”，除宣传教育工作做得不够外，一个重要原因就是关心他们太少。
    去年4月，我了解到林场村节育对象陈昌年不愿做节育手术，原因是实际困难没有得到解决。我就建议由村党支部出面借给他100元钱买粮食、化肥，又同他的组长商量，他去做节育手术，要安排劳动力把他家的秧及时插上。为这，陈昌年感动得哭了：“以前我总以为你们是做断子绝孙的事，现在看出来了，是一心一意办好事。”
    平时，我走访节育对象，发现谁家生产生活上有困难，就千方百计想法帮助。2年来，我已从自己不多的退休工资中拿出几百元钱、千余斤粮食借给节育对象，对困难的就算白送了。近2年里，我还亲自陪送50多名育龄青年到县技术站做节育手术，每次都为他们安排好吃住才离开。这些事都不大，算不上轰轰烈烈，可是人心都是肉长的，时间一长群众和我关系愈来愈亲密。
    一视同仁　以身作则
    “喊破嗓子，不如做出样子。”我有1个儿子和3个女儿，儿子只生了一个女孩，我动员他领了独生子女证。大女儿晚婚晚育后也生了一个女孩，我也要他们去领独生子女证。我老伴思想不通，亲家母也一心一意要抱孙子，而且大女儿也真的又怀孕了。老伴劝我：“这事你甭管，免得伤了亲家和气。”我说，共产党员不能光做别人工作，要求别人计划生育，应该以身作则，对家里人要和群众一视同仁。通过家庭会议和个别谈心，终于把两家的老老少少思想都打通了。我老伴亲自陪女儿去做了人工流产，并领了独生子女证。三女儿的男朋友也同意了我对他们“先立业后结婚、晚婚晚育”的建议，推迟婚期。此外，我还动员6个亲友落实了节育措施并领取了独生子女证。
    现在，在我和亲友的带动下，我们这里该落实节育措施的，已全部落实。去年我们村人口自然增长率继续下降，跨入了先进行列。
