On the eve of National Day, Comrade Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, delivered an important speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China issued a notice requiring all levels of party committees and propaganda departments to seriously study, publicize, and implement this important speech. This is an important task for ideological and political work in the coming period, and all levels of leadership must pay great attention to this work.

In his speech, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a scientific theory that has been tested by ten years of practice and recognized and accepted by hundreds of millions of people. It is the banner guiding us to continue moving forward." The speech, guided by Comrade Xiaoping's theory, scientifically summarizes the experience of New China since its founding, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, as well as the lessons from the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the spring and summer of this year, drawing four basic conclusions, and clarifying ten important issues that need special attention in the current work of the Party and the state. This is a programmatic document guiding the current work of the entire Party and the country. During the drafting of the speech, opinions from both inside and outside the Party were widely solicited and absorbed, making the speech a crystallization of collective wisdom. Eight years ago, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee adopted the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China." Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech upholds the basic spirit of the "Resolution" and, based on the fresh experience of the past eight years and the current reality, makes new summaries and generalizations. This is of great significance for further unifying the thoughts of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and for promoting socialist construction and reform.

To study the speech well, the most important thing is to carry forward the fine tradition of linking theory with practice. Only by linking with practice can one deeply understand the great significance of Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; only by linking with practice can one truly grasp the four basic conclusions drawn from 40 years of history; only by linking with practice can one achieve unity of thought and action on several important issues in the current work of the Party and the state; only by linking with practice can one effectively resist and overcome the influence of bourgeois liberalization and always maintain a firm and correct political direction.

Linking with practice means linking with the reality of China's reform and construction, linking with the reality of work in one's own region, department, and unit, and also linking with one's own ideological reality. How do we view the achievements and mistakes of the past 40 years? How do we view the achievements and existing problems of the past ten years of reform? How do we view the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the spring and summer of this year, as well as the suppression of the turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary rebellion? How do we view a series of important issues in the current work of the Party and the state? Every comrade, especially those in leadership positions, must, in the process of studying the speech, link with their own ideological reality, so that their understanding of the above major issues is truly unified with the line, principles, and policies of the Party Central Committee.

To make the study effective, the key is for leaders at all levels, especially those at the county level and above, to take the lead in studying the speech well. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech: "The Party's theoretical advancement is the fundamental guarantee of the correctness and scientific nature of the Party's leadership." In recent years, the reason why bourgeois liberalization has been able to spread and many of the Party's correct policies and principles have not been well implemented is greatly related to the fact that many leading cadres have been bogged down in daily affairs and have relaxed their theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We should take the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech as a turning point to truly improve the theoretical level and political acumen of all Party members.

    领导带头学　联系实际学
    本报评论员
    国庆节前夕，江泽民同志在庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年大会上代表党中央、国务院发表了重要讲话。中共中央宣传部发出通知，要求各级党委和宣传部门认真学习、宣传和贯彻这个重要讲话。这是今后一个时期思想政治工作的一项重要任务，各级领导务必要十分重视这项工作。
    江泽民同志在讲话中指出：“邓小平同志关于建设有中国特色社会主义的理论，是经过十年实践检验而为亿万人民所认识和接受的科学理论，是指引我们继续前进的旗帜。”讲话以小平同志的理论为指导，对新中国成立以来特别是党的十一届三中全会以来的经验，以及今年春夏之交的动乱和反革命暴乱的教训作了科学的总结，得出四个基本结论，并且阐明了当前党和国家工作中需要特别注意统一认识的十个重要问题。这是指导当前全党和全国各项工作的纲领性文件。在讲话起草过程中，广泛征求并吸收了党内外同志的意见，讲话是集体智慧的结晶。八年前，党的十一届六中全会作出《关于建国以来党的若干历史问题的决议》。江泽民同志的讲话坚持了《决议》的基本精神，并根据八年以来的新鲜经验和当前的实际，做了新的概括和总结，这对于进一步统一全党、全军、全国各族人民的思想，推动社会主义建设和社会主义改革，具有重要的意义。
    学好讲话，最重要的是要发扬理论联系实际的优良学风。联系实际，才能深刻领会小平同志关于建设有中国特色的社会主义的理论的重大意义；联系实际，才能切实掌握从40年历史中得出的四个基本结论；联系实际，才能在当前党和国家工作中的若干重要问题上统一认识，统一行动；联系实际，才能有效地抵制和克服资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，时刻保持坚定正确的政治方向。
    联系实际，要联系我国改革和建设的实际，要联系本地区、本部门、本单位工作的实际，还要联系自己的思想实际。对我国40年来的成就和失误怎么看？对十年改革的成就和存在的问题怎么看？对今年春夏之交发生的动乱和反革命暴乱以及制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱怎么看？对当前党和国家工作中一系列重要问题怎么看？每个同志特别是担负领导工作的同志都要在学习讲话的过程中，联系自己的思想实际，使自己对上述重大问题的认识真正统一到党中央的路线、方针、政策上来。
    要使学习取得实效，关键是各级领导干部特别是县级以上干部要带头学好。江泽民同志在讲话中指出：“党在理论上的提高，是党的领导的正确性、科学性的根本保证。”近几年，资产阶级自由化思潮之所以能够泛滥，党的很多正确的方针、政策之所以不能很好地落实，同许多领导干部陷入日常事务、放松对马列主义、毛泽东思想的理论学习有很大的关系。我们应当以学习江泽民同志的讲话为转折点，切切实实提高全党同志的理论水平和政治敏锐性。
