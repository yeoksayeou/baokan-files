Lake South, Qí Chénglín writes: Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, reports from the public about corruption among some Party and government officials have been increasing, providing favorable conditions for the current strict governance of the Party. However, due to some departments' inadequate protection of the confidentiality of reports and materials, incidents of retaliation against whistleblowers have occurred, causing many people to hesitate to report issues to certain departments. They fear that their reports will be returned to their original units for investigation and handling; they fear that their unit leaders will send people to the disciplinary inspection, supervision, or judicial departments to check the reports and inquire about the whistleblowers' information; they fear that phone reports will be recorded or must be announced; they fear that there are informants within the law enforcement departments, secretly communicating information.

For this reason, I suggest: The relevant higher-level departments should strictly enforce confidentiality measures. Departments receiving reports, except for those falsely accusing others, should generally not return the materials to the original units for handling, regardless of the level of officials involved. Unit leaders should not use understanding the situation as an excuse to send people to relevant departments to inquire about the whistleblowers' information. Higher-level law enforcement departments can use the form of notification for report materials that need to be investigated and handled by subordinate units.

Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Xiāo Yángwǔ writes: In recent years, relevant departments in our province have taken measures such as sea interception, border blockade, land inspection, and market management to actively combat smuggling, private trade, and speculation. Significant results have been achieved. According to statistics from the Provincial Anti-Smuggling Office, from mid-April to June this year alone, various places in the province have seized 3,371 smuggling cases, confiscating smuggled goods worth over 140 million yuan, and have apprehended and prosecuted a number of key criminals. However, smuggling and speculation activities are still rampant. Yet, from the economic cases cracked by the Dongguan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce in the past two years, cases solved through public reports have been decreasing yearly. The main reason is that whistleblowers fear retaliation. In the past, there have been instances where whistleblowers were threatened by criminals and sought protection from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. Some whistleblowers did not dare to show their faces for half a year, did not dare to reveal their names or units, and did not dare to claim their rewards. From this, it can be seen that to protect the public's enthusiasm for reporting and to eliminate the worries of whistleblowers, it is necessary to severely punish criminals.

### 维护举报人权利

　　维护举报人权利
　　严格保密制度
    湖南　齐成林来信：党的十三届四中全会开后，群众举报党和政府中某些干部腐败行为的日趋增多，为当前从严治党提供了有利条件。但是，由于有些部门对举报的信件和材料保密不够，举报人遭受打击报复的现象时有发生，致使不少人对向有些部门揭发问题心有余悸：怕举报材料被退回原单位调查处理；怕单位领导派人到纪检、监察、司法部门查阅举报信件，打听举报人的情况；怕用电话举报被录音，或必须通报；怕法纪职能部门有内线，暗通情报。
    为此我建议：上级有关部门要严格保密制度，收到举报材料的部门，除诬陷他人者外不管涉及到哪一级干部，一般不得将材料退回原单位处理；有关单位领导不能以了解情况为由，派人到有关部门了解举报人的情况；上级法纪职能部门对需要下属单位调查处理的举报材料，可采用通报的形式。
    严惩犯罪分子
    广东省工商局　肖扬武来信：近年来，我省有关部门，采取海上抓、关口堵、陆上查、市场管等措施，积极打击走私贩私、投机倒把活动，取得了显著成效。据省打击走私办公室统计，仅今年4月中旬至6月，全省各地共查获走私案件3371起，缴获走私货总值1.4亿多元，并将一批重要案犯缉拿法办。但是，走私贩私与投机倒把分子活动仍十分猖獗。可是，从东莞市工商局近两年破获的经济案件来看，属于群众举报而破获的案件逐年减少。其原因主要是：举报人怕打击报复。过去曾出现过举报人受到犯罪分子的威胁，跑到工商局要求保护。有的举报人半年不敢露面，不敢暴露姓名、单位，不敢认领奖金。由此可见，要重视保护群众的举报积极性，解除举报人的后顾之忧，必须严惩犯罪分子。
