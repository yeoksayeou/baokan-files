Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Xuanwu District Sub-bureau, based on public reports, cracked a case involving four provinces and municipalities in the production and sale of obscene books, seizing a large number of obscene books and illegal publications. At the same time, they also uncovered a number of illegal printing houses and gangs selling obscene books, with 13 criminals arrested and detained. Today, Beijing held a meeting to commend and reward 27 individuals who contributed to the case, aiming to promote the in-depth development of the city's "anti-pornography" campaign.

Deputy Mayor He Luli said that after more than two months of rectification and management, the atmosphere in the city's book, newspaper, magazine, and audio-visual markets has improved, and the content has been purified. However, it must be recognized that the "yellow tide" has not been completely eradicated. Many street vendors still have books, magazines, and audio-visual products that should be confiscated, selling them at high prices when the opportunity arises. The rectification and inspection work in some internal libraries of units still has blind spots. Therefore, she urged all levels of leadership to overcome complacency, avoid formalism, and not just make a show of things. They should combine the fight against pornography with the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, corruption, and the danger of a peaceful evolution. They should strengthen leadership and persistently, thoroughly, and effectively carry out this work.

    北京表彰扫黄有功者
    本报北京10月19日讯　记者颜世贵报道：北京市公安局宣武分局根据群众举报，查获了一起涉及4个省市的制作贩卖淫秽图书案，收缴了大量淫秽图书和非法出版物，同时还查获了一批非法印刷点和销售淫秽图书团伙，13名案犯一一被抓获收审。北京市今天召开大会，对破案中27名有功人员进行表彰奖励，以此推动全市“扫黄”工作的深入开展。
    副市长何鲁丽说，经过两个多月的整顿治理，全市的书报刊音像市场的空气清新了，内容净化了。但也必须看到，“黄色浊流”目前还没有得到彻底根治，不少书摊手中还有应该查缴的书刊音像制品，他们伺机高价出售，一些单位内部图书馆的整治清查工作仍有“死角”。为此，她要求各级领导克服松劲情绪，不走过场，不搞一阵风，把“扫黄”同反对资产阶级自由化、反腐败、反演变结合起来，加强领导，深入持久地把这项工作抓紧、抓狠、抓实、抓彻底。
