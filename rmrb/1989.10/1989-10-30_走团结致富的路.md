In the suburbs of Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, on the northern bank of the Xilugu River, there is a well-known village for its ethnic unity and prosperity, known as Wangfu Village in Wangfu Township. The village is home to both Mongolian and Han ethnic groups.

Wangfu Village was once the location of the prince's residence of the Qing Dynasty's arrogant bull prince. Before liberation, part of the Mongolian population here belonged to the aristocratic class. Due to class conflicts, there were often friction between the ethnic groups. After liberation, ethnic tensions eased; however, during the ten years of turmoil, the excavation of "internal people's parties" here cast a shadow over the previously eased ethnic relations. After that, the two ethnic groups often quarreled over minor issues, causing great suffering for the local people. By 1978, out of the village's 540 households, 120 still struggled to make ends meet, with an average annual income of only 90 yuan.

The spring breeze of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China blew away the clouds over people's hearts, and the thorough implementation of the Party's ethnic policies untied the knots in people's hearts. The village established a party branch consisting of three Mongolian party members and two Han party members. The party branch and the village committee members worked together, seizing the opportunity to learn and implement ethnic policies, and spared no effort to promote ethnic unity.

In the new situation of deepening rural reforms, the party branch identified the path to poverty alleviation and prosperity. After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, due to historical reasons, some people had low production capacity and were not skilled in farming. The village party branch and village committee members identified key individuals and took the lead in helping them escape poverty. Mongolian farmer Bai Xiangjun's family of five had weak labor force and limited agricultural knowledge. In the year the responsibility system was implemented, his family did not harvest much grain. Han cadre and village committee director Zhao Shiyang took him as his contact household, actively helping him with planning and management from spring plowing to autumn harvest. By 1986, Bai Xiangjun's family income per capita increased from 200 yuan in 1983 to 350 yuan.

Han farmer Yu Haiwang and his elderly wife, both in their sixties, had no livestock or farming tools and once considered suicide. Party branch secretary Meng Dianshan and party member Wang Zhensheng (both Mongolian) led their own cattle to help him plow the fields. After more than two years of assistance, the elderly couple not only found the will to live but also had surplus grain and savings.

Under the leadership of Mongolian and Han party members, the entire village formed a good tradition of mutual help. In June 1986, Mongolian farmer Meng Xianming went to work in Hulinhe, but his mother-in-law passed away and his wife fell seriously ill. During the critical weeding season, with continuous rain, his family's fields were about to be abandoned. The entire village mobilized more than 20 women from various ethnic groups to take care of his family's seven-person contracted fields. In 1988, Mongolian farmer Liu Shufan and his wife had already completed divorce procedures. Han farmers Liu Shuzong and Wang Guizhi, upon learning this, made six trips to Liu Shufan's father-in-law's home, helping Liu Shufan and his wife reconcile. The village party branch and village committee also actively helped the masses find opportunities according to relevant policies, supporting the surplus labor force to engage in labor services, establish small construction teams, and develop transportation specialists. At the same time, they encouraged the masses to plant grass manually and develop animal husbandry.

In this way, in just eight years, Wangfu Village shed its poverty and is now prosperous. Currently, more than 80% of the households in the village have built brick houses, over 400 households have savings, and many families have televisions, tape recorders, washing machines, electric fans, and some even have thermostats. The village is filled with a scene of unity and prosperity.

　　走团结致富的路
　　赵天翔
    在内蒙古自治区赤峰市郊的西路嘎河北岸，有一个闻名遐迩的民族团结致富的先进村，这就是蒙古族、汉族杂居的王府乡王府村。
    王府村早年是清朝傲牛王的王爷府所在地，解放前，这里的一部分蒙古族属于贵族阶层。由于阶级矛盾，常引起民族间的磨擦。解放后，民族矛盾才得到缓和；可是，十年动乱中在这里挖“内人党”，给缓和了的民族关系，又笼罩上一层阴影。此后，两民族间常常为一点小事闹得不可开交，闹来闹去苦了这里的群众，到一九七八年全村五百四十户，还有一百二十户吃了上顿没下顿，人均年收入只有九十元。
    党的十一届三中全会的春风，吹走了罩在人们心头上的阴云，党的民族政策的彻底落实，解开了人们心头上的疙瘩。村里首先成立了由三名蒙古族党员和两名汉族党员组成的党支部，村党支部一班人同村委会成员一道，趁热打铁，带头学好民族政策，千方百计在搞好民族团结上下功夫。
    在农村改革步步深入的新形势下，党支部认准了引导群众走脱贫致富这条路。农村实行联产承包责任制以后，由于历史的原因，部分人生产能力低，不擅长农活，村党支部和村委会成员确定重点对象，带头帮助他们脱贫。蒙古族农民白相军全家五口人，劳动力很弱，加上不大懂农业技术，生产责任制推行的当年，他家没打多少粮食。汉族干部、村委会主任赵世旺把他做为自己的联系户，从春耕到秋收主动帮助他料理谋划。到一九八六年，白相军一家的人均收入由一九八三年的二百元上升到三百五十元。
    汉族农民于海旺老两口都是六十多岁的老人，种地一没牲畜，二没农具，曾一度产生轻生念头。党支部书记孟殿山和共产党员王振生（都是蒙古族），就牵着自家的牛帮他把地种上。经过两年多的帮助照顾，老两口不但有了生活下去的勇气，而且有了余粮和存款。
    在蒙汉族党员的带领下，全村形成了一家有事，大家去帮的好风气。一九八六年六月，蒙古族农民孟宪明去霍林河做工，正赶上他的岳母去世，爱人又得了重病，时逢拔苗季节，阴雨连绵，他家的地眼看要荒废，全村就出动了二十多名各族妇女，把他家七口人的承包地全部侍弄了一遍。一九八八年，蒙古族农民刘树凡夫妇已经办了离婚手续，汉族农民刘树宗、王桂芝得知后，往返于刘树凡岳父家六次，使刘树凡夫妇破镜重圆。村党支部、村委会还根据有关政策，积极帮助群众找门路，支持多余的劳力劳务输出，办小型基建队、发展运输专业户。同时，鼓励群众人工种草，发展畜牧业。
    就这样，八年时间，王府村就脱掉了贫困的帽子，如今，全村已有百分之八十以上的户盖上砖瓦房，四百多户人家有存款，许多人家有了电视机、收录机、洗衣机、电风扇，有的还安上了调温器。村里到处是一派团结富裕的景象。
