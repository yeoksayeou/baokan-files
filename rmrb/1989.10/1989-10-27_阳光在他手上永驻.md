Sunlight dwells forever on his hands. They bring warmth, comfort, and health. His eyes can see through tendons, bones, and the mysteries of the human body.

In the southern Fujian hometown, there are many renowned hospitals and doctors. However, in the small town of Quanzhou, a humble massage rehabilitation center has gained widespread fame. This center, though ordinary, is always bustling with patients seeking treatment. It's miraculous how a patient, who once came in with pain and needed assistance, can leave smiling and walking lightly after just a few sessions of his massage therapy.

He is Huang Yufeng, the director of this massage center. Huang Yufeng is neither a famous old traditional Chinese medicine doctor with a long beard nor a formally trained practitioner. However, from a young age, he delved into the treasures of traditional Chinese medicine, learning from masters and mastering martial arts. He is well-versed in the pathology and pharmacology of traditional Chinese medicine, and skilled in acupuncture, massage, and bone-setting. The shining heritage of Chinese medicine inspires him with a dream: to use his hands to treat diseases and achieve effects that advanced equipment and medicines cannot.

After the reform and opening up, his dream became a reality. The massage rehabilitation center was established and immediately welcomed by the people.

In this magical homeland, "flowers bloom in all four seasons, and rain is frequent. Winter has no snow, but thunder can be heard."

The locals, government officials, nearby villagers, patients from other regions, overseas Chinese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong and Macau compatriots all come to this small clinic with their love and trust in the medical heritage of the motherland and the loyal sons and daughters of the homeland.

Because of this newly established small massage center and its ordinary yet unique contributions, the homeland is filled with even more warmth and brightness!

A 57-year-old Singaporean Chinese from Guangdong, Mr. Li, suffers from cervical to lumbar spine bone hyperplasia, making it difficult for him to turn his head and walk in pain. He specially came to Quanzhou, and after more than a month of careful treatment by Huang Yufeng, his pain was finally relieved. He specially made a banner with the words "Miraculous Hands Revive the Spring" to express his gratitude. He felt that the brothers in the homeland were particularly warm, and the sky and water in the homeland were particularly blue and clear!

A Taiwanese from Jinjiang, Ms. Hong, had a stomach prolapse of 8 centimeters. She returned to her hometown and heard about Huang Yufeng's medical skills and ethics, so she came to Quanzhou to seek treatment. After just over 20 days of treatment, she recovered her health. No wonder she praised Huang Yufeng's hands as "miraculous hands" in a letter she sent to him after returning to Taiwan. However, Huang Yufeng is not satisfied with this. He cannot just wait for patients to come from all directions. He is not satisfied with gaining praise here.

For a long time, he has been going to the Overseas Chinese Federation Building every afternoon to treat the "three compatriots," regardless of wind or rain, heat or cold. Whether it is a compatriot who has traveled thousands of miles from a foreign land to seek treatment or someone who has encountered an opportunity to treat a long-term illness at the Overseas Chinese Federation Building, during this time, the Overseas Chinese Federation Building is filled with warm waves of hometown affection...

The miraculous hands of the homeland's massage therapist always treat patients with meticulous care. Every day, he massages dozens of patients, which is indeed tiring, but no matter how tired he is, he has never been careless. He says that carelessness cannot achieve results. Therefore, on his hands with prominent tendons, sunlight and spring breeze will never disappear. He wants to use his hands to paint endless spring colors for the homeland.

　　阳光在他手上永驻
　　陈志泽
    他的手上有明亮的阳光，有暖人的春风，带给人情意，带给人舒适，带给人健康。
    他的眼睛能透视筋脉，透视骨骼，透视人体的神秘世界。
    闽南侨乡大医院、大医生不少，可是，泉州花巷，一家小小的按摩康复中心的这位名不见经传的按摩师却声名远扬……
    这家按摩康复中心寻常而又寻常，但似乎什么时候你都能见到有病人趴在那仅有的几张病床上接受按摩诊治。好神呵，一位病人，刚刚还呻吟着由别人搀扶着来，经他按摩不多久，就能笑逐颜开轻捷地坐了起来！
    他就是这家按摩中心的主任、侨属黄玉飞。黄玉飞既不是垂髯三尺的名老中医，也不是受过专门训练的“科班出身”。但是，还在很小的时候，他就一头钻进祖国的传统中医学的宝库，拜名师，习武艺，谙熟中医病理药理，精通点穴按摩、移轮接骨。闪闪发光的中华医学遗产给他以昭示，黄医师的心头时常扑腾着一个愿望：凭一双手治病，取得高级器械、高级药物不能取得的特殊效果。
    在改革开放的浩浩长风吹拂侨乡之后，他的这个愿望变为现实了。按摩康复中心一创办就受到人们的欢迎。
    在侨乡这片神奇的土地上，“四序有花长见雨，一冬无雪却闻雷”。
    侨乡的市民、机关干部，邻近的村民百姓，外地的病人，海外华侨、台胞、港澳同胞，满怀对于祖国医学遗产和侨乡忠诚儿女的热爱和信赖，纷纷到这小诊所来了！
    侨乡因了这刚刚诞生的小小按摩中心，因了它所做出的寻常而又独特的奉献而洋溢着更加浓郁的温馨和明丽！
    57岁的广东籍新加坡华侨李先生，身患颈椎至腰椎骨质增生，头部转动困难，行走更是痛苦。他专程赶到泉州，经黄医师一个多月精心的治疗终于解除了病痛。他特制锦旗，上书“妙手回春”表达谢意。他感到侨乡的兄弟格外亲，侨乡的天格外蓝、水格外清！
    一位晋江籍台胞洪女士，胃下垂8厘米，她回到故乡听人说起黄医师的医术医德，便来到泉州请求黄医师诊治，仅治疗20多天便恢复了健康，难怪她在回到台湾后给黄医师的一封信中要称赞黄医师的手是“神手”。黄医师并不以此为满足，他不能只是等待病人从四面八方来，他不满足于在此处收获赞誉。
    已经有好长的时间了，他每天下午要到侨联大厦为
  “三胞”治病，风雨无阻，寒暑不歇。专程千里迢迢从异国他乡赶来请求他治病也好，到了侨联大厦，碰上了治疗多年顽疾的良机也好，在这一段时间，侨联大厦荡漾起温暖的乡情之波……
    妙手回春的侨乡按摩师为病人诊治总是一丝不苟的。每一天为几十个病人作按摩，实在很疲累，但即使再疲累，他也从没有马虎过。他说马虎是不能取得效果的。因此，他那一双筋脉突起的手上，阳光和春风是不会消失的。他要用双手为侨乡描绘不尽的春色。
