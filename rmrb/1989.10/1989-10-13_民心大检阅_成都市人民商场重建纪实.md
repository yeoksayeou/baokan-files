During the National Day holiday this year, the most bustling place in Chengdu was the People's Department Store. The store, painted in a light yellow hue, was adorned with colorful flags, balloons, flowers, and green leaves, making it particularly eye-catching. At night, the lights illuminated the store, making it shine like a brilliant gem. During the holiday, the store was crowded, with an average of over 200,000 customers visiting daily, and sales reaching 2.35 million yuan over three days.

Who could believe that just three months ago, this department store, which had an annual turnover of 2.5 billion yuan and created over 20 million yuan in taxes and profits, was reduced to ashes in a fire, causing direct economic losses of over 1 billion yuan? Minister of Commerce Hu Ping lamented that this was the largest single loss in the commercial system since the founding of the nation.

Even more unbelievable was that in just 56 days, the burned-down store rose from the ruins. During these 56 days and nights, the people of Chengdu, filled with hatred for the turmoil and fueled by the passion of blood and fire, wrote a song of righteousness for the Chinese nation at an unprecedented speed.

People will never forget June 4th, when Chengdu experienced a severe disturbance in response to the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, involving widespread looting, vandalism, and arson. At around 2 AM on June 5th, the criminals shouted, "Burn down the People's Department Store," while using bricks and sticks to smash the store's doors and windows, stealing goods and setting them on fire. Led by the store's management, over a hundred employees bravely fought the fire and rescued the goods, while the criminals continued to set fires inside the store, throwing bottles of liquor into the flames and pouring them over the merchandise. The entire store quickly became a sea of fire.

At around 4:30 AM on June 5th, several hundred armed police officers escorted firefighters into the burning store, braving the criminals' frenzied attacks. By 9 AM, the fire was finally extinguished, leaving the store in ruins. The loss of goods and some assets alone amounted to 47.33 million yuan. The store's employees wept bitterly, and the onlookers were choked with sorrow.

Early in the morning, the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government quickly circulated the document "Introduction to the Situation in the People's South Road Square on June 4th," calling on all Party members and the people of Chengdu to resolutely oppose and combat the severe criminal activities of looting, vandalism, and arson, and to firmly fight against the few rioters and lawbreakers.

The fire destroyed the store but ignited the anger in people's hearts, awakening their consciousness. Within a few days, based on reports from the public, 175 criminals involved in the looting and burning of the People's Department Store were swiftly arrested by the public security authorities. In just two days, the severe disturbances in Chengdu were brought under control.

On June 6th, the day after the fire, while criminals were still rampaging through the streets, the store's employees, divided into nine vehicles, held up signs reading "Self-Reliance and Rescue," breaking through numerous roadblocks to enter the store's ruins.

To quickly address the dining needs of the store's thousands of employees, the Sichuan Provincial Government offered to provide the Exhibition Hall in the city center for free use by the store, and the Municipal Government also prepared to take corresponding measures.

Facing the ruins of the store, General Manager Lü Gēnxù, who had led the employees in their final struggle to save the store, stood tall: "We will not become a wandering store. Selling goods on the street would be a disgrace to the government. We will rise from the ruins and show the criminals the power of the Party and the people!"

"National property, even the smallest items, must be retrieved." The store's employees rushed into the smoke-filled ruins, stepping on the hot ashes, enduring the scorching heat, and braving the nauseating smells. They used their hands and sticks to dig through the ashes, carefully searching for any remaining goods, documents, and office supplies. They gathered the damaged and deformed goods into piles. In the ruins, they managed to recover losses amounting to over 10 million yuan.

The slogan "Rebuild the People's Department Store!" was immediately supported by the Party, the government, and various sectors of society:

- The Ministry of Commerce allocated 20 million yuan and loaned 300 million yuan to the store, providing a large amount of building materials and goods, and organizing supplies for the store's reopening through commercial institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities.

- Banks and financial departments promptly provided funds to address the store's urgent needs; the insurance company, in an exceptional move, compensated 110 million yuan under the "flexible compensation" method.

- Various industries contributed money and effort, extending helping hands. Even the monks from the ancient Wuyou Temple on Mount Emei sent their sincere blessings.

One day, the store's reception office received a pile of crumpled money, totaling 159.3 yuan, including over 830 coins! It turned out that these were the savings of over 1,000 students from the Peng County Menglian Town Central Primary School. Over 1,000 children saved their pocket money, hoping to contribute to the reconstruction of the store.

The villagers of Yuantong Village, Yongfeng Township, Jinniu District, saw on television that the store had been burned down and many of them cried. They pooled together 3,000 yuan and sent two villagers to deliver it to the store.

In just over a month, the store received over 7 million yuan in personal donations and over 3 million yuan in materials from various units, along with countless letters, telegrams, and gifts from all over the country. Faced with the deep affection of the Party and the people, the store's employees were deeply moved.

To quickly rebuild the store, the Municipal Government established a leading group according to the "special measures for special cases" requirement, deciding to first build temporary business premises on the ruins and resume operations as soon as possible.

The design, survey, planning, and urban construction departments quickly provided all the necessary drawings and documents for construction and completed all the construction procedures. The participating units broke away from traditional construction norms, actively coordinated, and cooperated with each other, fighting a battle of super strength and endurance. The 16,000-square-meter ruins were cleared in just 12 days; the 80-ton steel frame and accessories were manufactured in just 8 days; the 5,000-square-meter temporary business premises were completed in just 30 days...

In just 56 days, a brand-new People's Department Store was reborn from the ashes, like a phoenix rising from the flames. The creators of this miracle are the Party, the government, and the broad masses of the people.

On August 1st, the People's Department Store reopened. People from all directions flocked to the store, bringing firecrackers and heartfelt wishes. The store was packed, and the scene was unprecedented. On the first day of reopening, the store's sales reached 9 million yuan, setting a new record for the store's daily sales.

During these 56 unforgettable days and nights, the store's employees deeply felt the support of the people in times of difficulty and strove to repay the people's love with the best service quality. Before the National Day, the store invited customers to comment on the variety of goods, product quality, service attitude, and other aspects. Out of the 1,616 comment cards returned, the satisfaction rate was 97.4%.

Currently, the store receives an average of 150,000 customers daily. People come to the store not only to shop but also to walk around and reflect. On September 3rd, the first Sunday of the new school year, 60 university students from Sichuan University's National Economy Management Department visited the store, watched a video of the store being burned, and listened to the store's staff recount the moving story of the reconstruction. A female student excitedly said, "We had a vivid ideological education class here, further clarifying the true nature and essence of this turmoil and riot, and seeing the power of the Party, the power of the people, and feeling the goodness of socialism."

In the hearts of the people, the newly built People's Department Store records the indomitable spirit of the people and the Republic overcoming difficulties together; the People's Department Store, with its experience of "death and rebirth," proves that the greatness of the Chinese nation lies in its ability to heal its wounds through its own strength.

    民心大检阅
    ——成都市人民商场重建纪实
    新华社记者　李南玲　成建
    今年国庆期间，成都最热闹的地方是市人民商场。在这里，乳黄色的商场被彩旗、汽球、鲜花、绿叶簇拥得格外夺目。入夜华灯齐放，犹如璀璨的明珠。假日里，商场内熙熙攘攘，平均每天接待顾客20多万人次，3天销售额高达235万元。
    谁能相信，3个月前，这家年营业额2.5亿元、创造税利2000多万元的西南地区最大的综合性商场竟被烧成灰烬，直接经济损失上亿元。商业部部长胡平痛心地称这是商业系统建国以来一次性损失最大的灾难。
    更叫人难以相信的是，仅仅56天，被烧毁的商场又在废墟上崛起。在这56个日日夜夜里，成都人民怀着对动乱的憎恨，饱蘸着血与火的激情，用前所未有的速度，谱写了一曲中华民族的正气歌。
    人们忘不了6月4日这一天，成都发生了同北京反革命暴乱相呼应的震惊全国的打、砸、抢、烧的严重骚乱。5日凌晨2时左右，歹徒们一面叫嚣：“烧掉人民商场”，一面用砖头棍棒撬砸商场的门窗，抢出商品肆意焚烧。在商场领导的率领下，护店的百余名职工奋力灭火，抢救转移商品，而歹徒们则又猖狂地在店堂内四处纵火，并将柜台内一瓶瓶名酒扔进火堆，洒在商品上。整个商场很快燃成一片火海。
    5日4时半左右，几百名武警官兵掩护消防队员，冒着歹徒的疯狂袭击，再次冲进火灾现场。上午9时，大火终于扑灭了，整个商场已成废墟，仅商品及部分资产损失就达4733万元。商场职工失声痛哭，围观群众悲咽不已。
    清早，成都市委、市政府迅速将《关于6月4日人民南路广场地区的有关情况介绍》的材料广为传达，号召全市共产党员和人民群众旗帜鲜明地坚决制止和反对打、砸、抢、烧等严重犯罪活动，同极少数暴徒和不法分子作坚决斗争。
    大火烧毁了商场，却点燃了人们心中的怒火，换来了人们的觉悟。几天之内，根据人民群众的举报，参与砸烧人民商场的175名歹徒被公安机关迅速抓获。仅仅两天，成都严重骚乱的局面得到平息。
    6月6日，也就是大火之后的次日，大街上的歹徒还在到处肆虐，商场职工分乘9辆汽车，高举着“生产自救”的牌子，冲破重重路障，开进了商场废墟。
    为了迅速解决商场几千人的吃饭问题，四川省人民政府提出将市中区的展览馆免费提供给商场使用，市人民政府也准备采取相应措施。
    面对这片断壁残垣的废墟，带领职工为保住商场奋战到最后的总经理吕根旭挺直了腰：“我们不当流亡商场，在外面摆摊子是给政府丢脸，我们要在废墟上重新站立起来，让歹徒看看党和人民的力量！”
    “国家财产，就是针头线脑也要拣回来。”商场职工扑进烟尘弥漫的废墟，踩着烫脚的焦土，冒着酷热的高温，忍着使人头晕目眩的刺鼻怪味，用手扒，用棍撬，在灰烬中，一点点地翻找残存的商品、资料及办公用品。他们将一件件残缺不全、变形变质的商品拣作一堆。就在这片废墟中，他们挽回损失100多万元。
    “重建人民商场！”他们提出的这一响亮口号，立即得到党和政府以及社会各界的大力支持：
    ——商业部给商场拨款200万元、贷款300万元，拨来大批建材和商品，并通过北京、上海、天津等商业机构为商场重新开业组织货源。
    ——银行、财政部门及时挤出资金解决商场燃眉之急；保险公司破例按“通融赔偿”方式，赔偿1100万元。
    ——各行各业有钱出钱，有力出力，纷纷伸出援助之手，连峨眉古刹万年寺的僧侣也送来了“善事多助”的虔诚祝福。
    一天，商场接待处收到一堆皱巴巴的钱，数了数，共159.3元，仅分币就有830多枚！原来，这些钱是彭县蒙阳镇中心小学1000多名小学生凑起来的。1000多个孩子省下了自己的冰棍钱，渴望能为重建商场出点力。
    金牛区永丰乡元通村的乡民们在电视上看到歹徒烧了商场，很多人都伤心地哭了。大家凑出3000元，派两位村民风尘仆仆地送到商场。
    在一个多月时间里，商场先后收到个人捐款70多万元，各单位捐赠物资30多万元，还有来自全国各地难以计数的慰问信、慰问电、慰问品。面对党和人民的深情，商场职工被深深感动了。
    为了尽快地重建商场，市政府按“特事特办”的要求成立了领导小组，决定先在废墟上建起临时营业用房，尽快恢复营业。
    设计、勘察、规划、城建等部门以最快的速度拿出了施工所需的全部图纸资料，办好了一切施工手续。参战的十几个单位打破传统的施工常规，主动协调，互相配合，打了一场超强度、超毅力的漂亮仗。1.6万多平方米的废墟12天就清理完毕；80吨重的屋架及附件制作只用了8天时间；5000多平方米的临时营业用房仅30天就建成了……
    在短短的56天里，一个崭新的人民商场像涅槃的凤凰又回到了人民身边。这奇迹的创造者是党和政府，是广大的人民群众。
    8月1日，人民商场重新恢复营业。人民群众从四面涌来，带来喜庆的鞭炮，带来衷心的祝愿。商场内挤得水泄不通，盛况空前。开业第一天，商场营业额高达90万元，创商场日营业额的历史最高水平。
    在56个难忘的日日夜夜里，商场职工感受至深，他们永远不忘在危难时刻人民的支持，努力用最佳的服务质量来报答人民的厚爱。国庆前，商场请顾客对经营品种、商品质量、服务态度等进行评议，在收回的1616张评议卡中，满意率为97.4％。
    目前，商场每天平均接待顾客15万人次。到商场来的人除了购物外，更多的是来走走、看看，在这里细细地寻觅，深深地反思。9月3日，是新学年的第一个星期天。四川大学国民经济管理系的60名大学生来到商场，观看商场被焚毁的录相，听商场同志讲述重建商场的感人经过。一位女学生激动地说：“我们在这里上了一堂生动的思想教育课，进一步认清了这次动乱、暴乱的真象和实质，更看到了党的力量，人民的力量，体会到了社会主义的好处。”
    在人民心中，新建的人民商场记载着人民群众与共和国共度危难的凛然正气；人民商场以“死而复生”的经历证明，中华民族的伟大就在于能够靠自己的力量去医治创伤。
