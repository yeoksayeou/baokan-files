Japanese meteorological authorities announced that at 2:26 PM on the 29th (Tokyo time), a 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck the ocean east of the Sanriku Coast of Japan's Honshu Island. The quake's epicenter was approximately 10 kilometers deep. According to reports, since the earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean, far from land, the nearby regions of Japan's Tohoku area, including Morioka, Hachinohe, and Miyako, were not significantly affected. There were no reports of casualties or structural damage.

　　日本东部海域发生强烈地震
    据日本气象厅宣布，二十九日下午二时二十六分（东京时间），日本本州三陆海岸以东海域发生里氏六点五级地震，震源深度约为十公里。据报道，由于地震发生在远离陆地的太平洋海域，离震中较近的日本东北地区的盛冈、八户、宫古等地受影响不大，没有造成人员伤亡和房屋倒塌等损害。
