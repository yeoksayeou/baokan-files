The Central Discipline Inspection Commission has informed reporters that recently, Quan Shuren, the Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee, investigated and analyzed the case of Xu Jiaqing, the former director of the Liaoyang Textile Factory, who was involved in bribery and corruption. He emphasized that in the promotion and use of cadres, one must not prioritize talent over virtue, and regard "revolutionization" as an optional discussion.

How did a well-known director of a large enterprise fall into the abyss of crime? Quan Shuren raised several thought-provoking questions based on the facts of Xu Jiaqing's criminal path.

From Xu Jiaqing's abuse of power as director, evading the supervision of the Party and the masses, to the serious consequences of weakening the Party's core political role in enterprises.

Xu Jiaqing became the director in 1982, and his main period of crime was from 1987 to the first half of 1989. During the investigation, Quan Shuren discovered that although there were many reasons for Xu Jiaqing's crimes, one important reason was his abuse of the powers granted to the director by the "Enterprise Law," separating himself from the organization and supervision of the Party and the masses, and engaging in power-for-money exchanges.

In 1987, the domestic yarn and fabric market shifted from stagnation to brisk sales. Seeing an opportunity, Xu Jiaqing used his authority over personnel to transfer his wife, Chang Jie, from a local enterprise to the factory, changing her from a worker to an official, and placing her in the marketing department to directly sell yarn and fabric. He also changed the management from two people to one, with Chang Jie in charge. Although the Party secretary, deputy director, and leaders of the municipal textile bureau repeatedly advised and opposed this, Xu Jiaqing remained obstinate.

Xu Jiaqing believed that the powers delegated by the state to the enterprise were given to the director, and that the director's responsibility system meant that the director had the final say.

Xu Jiaqing never accepted the supervision of the Party organization and the masses. The masses said he did not take the Party committee seriously at all. He often said at full staff meetings, "The Party committee can neither guarantee nor supervise the administration. Who knows if the Party committee will even exist in the future?" In this factory, the Party secretary also served as the deputy director, overseeing education, and was merely an assistant to the director. The Party organization could not exercise its supervisory function. The Party secretary said, "In recent years, in our factory, it has actually been the director leading the Party committee, and the individual leading the organization."

Xu Jiaqing's criminal path has shown us the serious consequences of Zhao Ziyang's attempt to reform the Party, downplay the Party's role, and deny the Party's core role in enterprises. It has made it impossible for the enterprise Party organization to exercise its guarantee and supervisory functions.

From Xu Jiaqing's use of the state's expansion of enterprise autonomy to commit crimes, to the importance of enterprises adhering to the socialist direction.

During the investigation, Quan Shuren discovered that one obvious feature of Xu Jiaqing's crimes was his exploitation of the operational autonomy granted by the state to enterprises, taking advantage of the reforms and opening up.

In recent years, the state has granted the Liaoyang Textile Factory the right to sell yarn and fabric, issuing mandatory and guidance plans for the factory. The enterprise could sell part of the excess yarn and fabric produced beyond the plans. Seeing an opportunity, Xu Jiaqing, in collaboration with Chang Jie, sold yarn and fabric multiple times to individual merchants, accepting a large amount of bribes.

Xu Jiaqing completely ignored the enterprise's direction in his internal operations. He treated the staff with a hiring mindset, using the banner of contracting to eat backhanded commissions from below. It was found that in the past two years, he approved and signed 39 workshop contracting agreements totaling 160,000 yuan, from which he received 14,000 yuan in backhanded commissions.

From Xu Jiaqing receiving more than ten honorary titles while engaging in bribery and corruption, to the harm of ignoring the "revolutionization" standard for cadres and being detached from the masses.

Xu Jiaqing's bribery and corruption crimes began in 1986 and reached an unbridled level in 1987, 1988, and the first half of 1989. During this period, Xu Jiaqing surprisingly received more than ten honorary titles. Quan Shuren felt that there were two issues worth drawing profound lessons from in the investigation: First, the standard for evaluating the good and bad of enterprise managers is seriously one-sided. Only looking at whether production has increased and profits have risen is considered good management, and the director must be a capable person. Later, the Liaoyang Textile Factory became a major tax-paying unit in Liaoyang City, all attributed to Xu Jiaqing's personal management skills, which is not in line with the facts. The one-sided evaluation of enterprise leaders' work covered up Xu Jiaqing's criminal facts and instead awarded him various honorary titles.

Xu Jiaqing's receipt of multiple honorary titles is also a result of our work being seriously detached from the masses. In 1987, during the election of district people's representatives, he was voted out in the Liaoyang Textile Election District. During the election of municipal people's representatives, he was elected without direct voting by the workers.

Xu Jiaqing's criminal facts show that he is a very bad cadre politically. It was found that during the Cultural Revolution, he not only testified and participated in the struggle sessions against factory-level leaders but also participated in house searches. The masses had long reported his problems during the Cultural Revolution, his work style issues, and his bribery issues, but these were not taken seriously by the relevant departments. Instead, he was promoted and used under the pretext of being "young and talented." Quan Shuren believes that in recent years, in the use of cadres, talent has been prioritized over virtue, and the "four modernizations" are often mentioned, but the important condition of "revolutionization" has been placed in a secondary position. This is a profound lesson.

    全树仁剖析熊家庆索贿受贿案时指出
    党在企业中核心作用必须保证  提拔使用干部绝不能重才轻德
    据新华社北京10月15日电（记者胡清海）记者从中央纪委获悉：辽宁省省委书记全树仁最近对辽阳纺织厂原厂长熊家庆索贿受贿案件进行了调查和剖析，提出在提拔和使用干部上绝不能重才轻德，把“革命化”这个重要条件当作可有可无的空谈。
    一个大型企业的厂长、有相当知名度的人物为何堕落为罪犯？全树仁从他走上犯罪道路的事实中提出了几个令人值得思考的问题。
    从熊家庆滥用厂长权力，摆脱党和群众的监督，看党在企业中的政治核心作用受到削弱的严重后果
    熊家庆1982年任厂长，他犯罪的主要时间是在1987年至1989年的上半年。全树仁在调查中发现，熊家庆犯罪的原因虽然很多，但他滥用《企业法》赋予厂长的权力，脱离党的组织和群众的监督，进行权钱交易是一个重要原因。
    1987年，国内纱、布市场由滞销变畅销，熊家庆见有机可乘，利用手中的人权，将妻子常洁从一个地方企业调到厂里，由工人变成干部，放到经营处直接批售纱、布，并把原来两个人管变为常洁一个人管。对熊家庆这种做法，虽然党委书记、副厂长、市纺织局领导都一再劝告和反对，但他仍一意孤行。
    熊家庆认为国家下放给企业的权力就是给厂长的，厂长负责制就是厂长个人说了算。
    熊家庆从来不接受党组织和群众的监督，群众说他根本不把党委放在眼里。他多次在全厂干部会上说：“党委对行政既保证不了也监督不了，将来党委是不是存在还不知道呢”。在这个厂里，党委书记兼副厂长，分管教育，只是厂长的助手，党组织无法发挥监督作用。党委书记说，“这几年在我们厂，实际是厂长领导党委，个人领导组织。”
    熊家庆走上犯罪道路，使我们看到了赵紫阳同志改造党、淡化党，否定党在企业中的核心作用的严重后果，它使企业党组织无法也无权行使保证监督的职能。
    从熊家庆利用国家扩大企业自主权进行犯罪活动，看企业坚持社会主义方向的重要性
    全树仁在调查中发现，熊家庆犯罪的一个明显特点是：利用国家给予企业的经营自主权，钻改革开放的空子。
    几年来，国家对辽阳纺织厂给予了纱、布的销售权，对厂下达指令性计划和指导性计划，企业超产的纱、布可以自销一部分。熊家庆以为有机可乘，大钻两种计划、两个市场、两种价格的空子。在省市一些纺织印染企业吃不饱的情况下，他伙同常洁，将纱、布多次卖给个体商贩，从中接受大量贿赂。
    熊家庆在厂内经营上完全不顾企业的方向。他用雇佣观点对待职工，对下打着承包的旗号，从中吃回扣。据查，近两年他批签车间承包合同39项，总金额16万元，他从中吃回扣1.4万元。
    从熊家庆在索贿受贿的同时获得十余种光荣称号，看忽视干部“革命化”标准和脱离群众的危害性
    熊家庆进行索贿受贿犯罪，从1986年开始，1987年、1988年和1989年上半年发展到肆无忌惮的程度。而恰恰在这个期间，熊家庆竟连续获得“荣誉称号”达10种之多。全树仁在调查中感到有两个问题值得吸取深刻的教训：一是衡量企业经营者好坏的标准存在着严重的片面性。只看生产上来了，利润增加了，就认为是企业经营得好，厂长一定是能人。辽阳纺织厂后来成为辽阳市上缴利税超千万的大户，都归功于熊家庆个人经营有方，是不符合实际的。考核企业领导者工作的片面性，掩盖了熊家庆的犯罪事实，反而授予他各种荣誉称号。
    熊家庆被授予多种荣誉称号，也是我们工作严重脱离群众的结果。1987年选举区人民代表，他在辽纺选区就落选了。在选举市人大代表时，由于不经过职工直接选举他才当选。
    熊家庆的犯罪事实，说明了他在政治上是一个很坏的干部。经查，“文革”期间他在批斗厂级领导干部时，不仅出面作证，摁脖子，还参加过抄家。对他“文革”中的问题群众早有反映，对他作风的问题以及受贿问题也早有揭发，但都未引起有关部门重视，反而以“年轻有才”为由对他提拔重用。全树仁认为，几年来，在使用干部上重才轻德，经常讲干部“四化”，实际上把“革命化”这个重要的条件放到次要位置。这是一条深刻的教训。
