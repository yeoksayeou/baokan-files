Construction has begun on a large platform for a residential building complex in Beijing's Fangzhuang district. This platform, with a total construction area of 24,000 square meters, is the largest double-directional multi-span concrete structure in China.

The platform consists of three sections, each covering over 8,000 square meters, connecting three residential areas. Each section is composed of six ultra-high-rise residential buildings. The platform's ground level is approximately 6 meters high and includes a centralized control and supply center for water, heating, electricity, and other utilities, as well as parking facilities. The upper level features a community service center, gardens, fountains, and other recreational areas. Sky bridges and corridors connect to cinemas, cultural activity centers, and other entertainment venues.

The dream of residents having a "football field" in the sky between buildings is becoming a reality.
