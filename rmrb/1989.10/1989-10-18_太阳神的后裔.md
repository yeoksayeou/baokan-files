This is an extremely tragic yet magnificent scene—a blazing sun suddenly plunges from the sky, falling, falling... until it crashes onto the earth with a thunderous roar. In an instant, the unfortunate sun vanishes, leaving behind only scattered remnants.

Thus, this day became a perpetual day of mourning for the Chinese nation;
Thus, the Chinese nation passed down from generation to generation a tragic story: the death of the Sun God, Yan Di.

The Sun God shattered, but what of the remnants?
Slowly, the dust of history covered everything.

1
Qianshang, this name evokes a beautiful illusion—a thousand dazzling suns shining and burning.

However, the reality of this small county in western Shaanxi is not as poetic as the illusion. The primordial giant, Pangu, swung his mighty axe from east to west, carving out a fertile Qin Basin. Just as it was about to reach here, just beyond a mountain ridge, the divine axe inexplicably lost its power.

Thus, this place remained the domain of mountains. To the east is Yongshan, to the north is Qianshan, and to the southwest is Longshan. The mountains, like heavy shackles, have confined the hopes of ascension here for thousands of years.

History progressed to the mid-1980s, 1985, November 3rd. Twelve Communist Party members quietly arrived here. They were a team from the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department and the Provincial Press and Publication Bureau, led by the heads of these departments. They came to assist the original Communist Party members here in achieving prosperity through poverty alleviation.

The car passed over Qianshang Ridge, and below was a scene that stirred a mix of emotions: the mountains were barren, the land was poor, and all around was a sea of brown and yellow poverty.

"We must accomplish something! We must work diligently for the mountain people!"

However, these bold words could not completely hide the emptiness in their hearts. Everyone knew they came from two "bureaucratic departments" with no money, no resources, and no technology. How could they alleviate poverty?

They listened to situation reports, reviewed county annals, conducted investigations, and divided into groups to stay in different areas. They lectured on documents and gave speeches. All of this was done in an orderly manner, but it was also aimless. No one could predict what kind of situation they would create.

They helped the county formulate the "nanny strategy," assisted in managing enterprises, secured a 2 million yuan loan for the cement factory's expansion project, helped the instant food factory enter the Xi'an market, and even donated money, food, and clothing to the needy. Everything was proceeding step by step.

They had done everything they could, but something was still missing.

Perhaps by chance, perhaps by necessity, Cao Huicong, who was stationed in Shigu Township, suddenly discovered a faint glow in this valley. He gently brushed away the dust of history, and there it was—a dazzling sun: golden and sparkling.

These were the embroideries of local women. Red cloth pieces, like the flames of the sun; golden threads, like the rays of the sun. The common sun pattern on the embroideries opened up a brilliant world in people's eyes.

Xiao Cao was captivated.

But for so many years, the sun had been burning in vain. The simple people of Qianshang used it at most to give to relatives and friends. Could it be used to illuminate the lives of the people of Qianshang?

In the history of Qianshang's folk arts and crafts, this should be recorded: In January 1986, Cao Huicong, a member of the Provincial Party Committee's Poverty Alleviation Team, took Qianshang's handicrafts to Xi'an for the first trial sale.

Before the Spring Festival, it was the off-season for tourism, but the Provincial Museum was bustling. On this day, among the crowd, a young man wearing glasses walked. He was not tall, quiet, and shy, carrying two paper boxes.

He was Xiao Cao, who had returned for a holiday.

Xiao Cao had a new discovery and began to think in this direction. A 30-something female Communist Party member, Xu Youjie, was skilled and daring, so he encouraged her to take the lead.

Now, he was carrying Xu Youjie's exquisite craftsmanship, as well as her trust and the hopes of the people of Shigu.

Outside the museum, there was a tourist service department with many handicrafts. Xiao Cao first approached them to request a purchase. They looked at the goods, which were much better than those in the glass display cases, but the price was very low, and they only offered consignment sales.

Xiao Cao then took the paper boxes to an old woman who specialized in selling tourist souvenirs. The shrewd old woman also offered a low price and consignment sales.

Should he go back to Shigu and report this?

Xiao Cao hesitated for a moment and decided to set up a stall. "I don't believe good things won't sell."

Two foreigners approached from the other side, seemingly a couple. They were captivated by the tiger-head shoes, chatting excitedly. Unexpectedly, the first transaction was "international trade." The foreigners took the tiger-head shoes and left happily, and a crowd gathered, selling four or five items. At this time, the shrewd old woman rushed over and took all the goods: "I'll take them all, cash on the spot."

The goods and money were taken back to Shigu, and the practical mountain people immediately became interested. Although only sixty or seventy yuan was sold, it was a good omen!

On a hot day in July 1986, a small car drove over Qianshang Ridge.

The visitor was a stout old comrade. He was Jin Zilin, an expert in folk arts and crafts. He was invited to conduct a survey and evaluate Qianshang's folk arts and crafts.

He was studying the theory of "folk customs and folk art archaeology." The team leader, Liu Chengzhang, and Lei Taoxing visited him at night. Upon hearing their description of Qianshang's arts and crafts, he immediately understood the significance.

Jin Zilin delved into Qianshang's folk arts and crafts. There were Ma Lie Mei's exquisite sachets, Yang Liexiu's ghostly paper cuts, Chen Fengjie's butterfly pouches, and Lü Ranguo's cat-head pendants... Each piece had a distinct primitive totemic charm and characteristics, and each piece bore the traces of Yangshao culture.

He also delved into historical documents and local annals. The annals recorded: Yan Di was born 80 li south of Qianshang in Mengyu and died in Tian Tai Mountain after tasting "fire seeds" in Mengyu; Zhou rose in Zhouyuan, about 100 li east of Qianshang; the ancestors of Qin once herded horses in Qianhe Valley...

He also studied the red pottery shards from the Yangshao period unearthed in Qianshang County. The patterns on the shards were very similar to the patterns on Qianshang's folk arts and crafts: sawtooth patterns, sun grid patterns, fish patterns, frog patterns, wave patterns... The connotations of Qianshang's folk art language and the connotations of Neolithic pottery language were rich, lawful, and consistent.

A distant scene gradually approached and became clear in his eyes—

After the snow, the entire tribe came out of the cave, kneeling in the sun that had just emerged from the clouds. Then, they danced wildly under the sun. The brave, fierce men, wearing animal skins around their waists and holding stone axes and bows and arrows, danced; the diligent women, wearing animal tooth necklaces and using bone needles, also danced. They danced and sang, their voices echoing in the vast sky...

His heart trembled. He had devoted decades of his life to folk art. Perhaps, the most significant discovery of his life would be made here.

Finally, he stood up and announced excitedly: This is the cultural deposit of the Sun God Yan Di's tribe!

"Shaanxi has two important cultures, one is the Yellow Emperor's tribe culture in northern Shaanxi, and the other is the Yan Di's tribe culture in the Baoji area. The Yan Di's tribe culture, characterized by sun worship, originated in the Baoji area, and this place may be the source of Yan Di culture." Jin Zilin told the members of the Provincial Party Committee's team.

The team members were overjoyed.

"Cultural relics can be divided into above-ground and underground cultural relics. Folk arts and crafts are above-ground cultural relics. Entering Qianshang County is like entering a large historical museum. Every piece of paper cutting, every embroidery tells us the age and proves that this is the culture of Yan Di's tribe." He told the officials of Qianshang County.

The officials of Qianshang County were ecstatic.

"Chinese women have made significant contributions to the development of Chinese culture and human civilization. The art of Qianshang is a treasure left by our ancestors. We are all descendants of the Sun God and should carry it forward." He told nearly a hundred female artists in Qianshang.

The female artists were overjoyed.

In the information age, new words emerge one after another. In September 1986, at a work meeting of the Art Department of Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts, a new term emerged—cultural poverty alleviation.

This mid-month, after a special symposium on Qianshang folk art organized by the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department, 28 teachers from the Art Department of Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts, led by Professor Fan Wenjiang, the department head, came to Qianshang at the invitation of the Provincial Party Committee's team. Their mission was to explore the path of cultural poverty alleviation.

The remote Qianshang had never seen so many experts at once. The small city was in an uproar.

This is Qianshang's folk arts and crafts, rugged and bright, ancient and profound. It is different from the grand and unified style of Luochuan in northern Shaanxi and the colorful and decorative style of neighboring Fengxiang. It is so unique and distinctive, and each piece can be traced back to ancient times.

The echoes of ancient times resonated here, and these echoes made these experts, who had been floating in the sea of folk art for many years, also amazed.

At the same time, their hearts were heavy. They knew better than anyone that the purity of folk art was achieved at the cost of closure and backwardness.

A vice-professor wrote: "Due to various reasons such as geography, nature, and humanities, Qianshang's economy is of a closed type, and traditional aesthetic concepts are also of a closed type. Therefore, many handicrafts still retain many traces of ancient folk art."

Because of the closure, the brilliant Sun God culture hid here from the "invasion" and "pollution" of external and palace cultures. When the remnants of the sun were extinguished in the storm of external cultures in some places, here it hid the fire seed.

It was also because of the closure that Qianshang had not been affected by external cultures, avoiding the impact of the waves of economic and cultural development, and falling behind in the ranks of social progress.

The wind and sand of history carved a cruel scene on the cliffs of Qianshang Ridge: The people of Qianshang preserved the brilliant Qianshang folk arts and crafts for the Chinese nation, but also preserved their long-term poverty and backwardness for themselves.

How to continue to excavate, inherit, and protect while introducing Qianshang crafts into modern life, making them have a production scale, and becoming a path to prosperity? How to maintain the original characteristics of folk art while injecting modern consciousness, making it keep pace with the times? Professor Fan Wenjiang, the head of the Art Department, who was over sixty, discussed this issue with the team members for several days.

Thus, the "Thousand Arts Action" was born—a new term that sparkled with the light of the times.

Thus, with the strong support of President Chen Qinan and Vice President Liu Wenxi, he brought two classes of students to Qianshang. On the one hand, they conducted on-site teaching, and on the other hand, they trained folk artists with the team and helped them create new works—"Thousand Arts Action" began.

Needles pulled golden threads flying up and down, dazzling the eyes. Suddenly, the golden threads were strung with gold coins. Shining gold coins, jingling gold coins...

This is, of course, a fantasy. The owner of this fantasy is Li Jingfeng, the township head of Nanzhai Township, Qianshang County.

He was a simple and honest official like a farmer, with a heart that communicated with farmers, and the courage and passion to benefit farmers.

At this time, the prelude to the "Thousand Arts Action" had been pulled open in Qianshang, and the main battlefield was in Nanzhai. He and his colleagues, the township Party Committee Secretary Yan Shuantai, were the most enthusiastic responders and supporters of the "Thousand Arts Action."

Folk arts and crafts do not require large investments, as long as there are needles and threads, they can be done sitting on the kang. They are not afraid of tight money, have low risks, quick results, and more importantly, every household can directly benefit...

He thought more and more beautifully, stroking his chin that was shaved blue, and laughed. That nearly absurd fantasy kept lingering in his mind.

"A needle, a thread, to string up the money of thousands of households." When he conveyed this vivid and vivid language to more than 1,000 village representatives, the village representatives' meeting immediately turned into a sea of fantasy.

The needle and thread also strung up these moving stories—

The township took the lead in establishing the "Qianshang County Folk Arts and Crafts Company." The company, with the support of the Provincial Party Committee's team and Professor Li Wenzhong from the Academy of Fine Arts, "trained elite troops and produced fine products." Now, the "elite troops" have reached more than 1,500 people, and the "embroidery village" is famous far and wide.

According to the plan, they started to develop professionally by village and group from the beginning. Some villages are good at making wall hangings, some are good at making five-poison horse bags, some are good at embroidering dragons and phoenixes, just like the workshops of a factory, and the departments of a hospital. Once there is an order, it is assigned according to the specialty, in an orderly manner.

The company has a folk arts and crafts exhibition. Whenever the township holds a meeting, visiting this exhibition is an important part of the meeting.

Township and village cadres treat folk artists as contact households, with special personnel responsible for helping these "wealth creators" and "art disseminators" to remove their worries.

Zhang Yujie, this nearly fifty-year-old rural woman, has a unique paper-cutting technique. The township listed her as a key artist and regarded her paper-cutting as a flagship product. Her courtyard is narrow and living is difficult, so the township gave her priority to approve the courtyard base; she is weak, so the township subsidized her 50 yuan, and the civil affairs officer sent it to her home. In early 1987, she and Lü Ranguo were selected together as county people's congress representatives, participating in the discussion of major county affairs.

All this is because a dream that makes people yearn for it is floating in the sky of Nanzhai.

5
Just as the "Thousand Arts Action" began, the second batch of poverty alleviation team from the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, consisting of 16 people, also arrived in Qianshang.

At that time, the sun had just been unearthed from the dust of history, and its light had not yet shone beyond the surrounding mountains. Thus, articles such as "Skillfully Cutting Spring Flowers with Fragrant Soil," "Qianshang Embroidery Woman Xu Youjie," and "Beautiful Spring in Qianshang" were published in "People's Daily," "Shaanxi Daily," and "Branch Life" and other newspapers; a collection of nearly ten thousand words, "Compilation of Qianshang Folk Art Materials," was quickly collected and compiled; they contacted the provincial television station to shoot a special program on Qianshang crafts, which was broadcasted.

Finally, Qianshang's folk arts and crafts began to gain some fame in the outside world. Especially after the article "Skillfully Cutting Spring Flowers with Fragrant Soil" written by Deputy Team Leader Han Xuerun about the paper-cutting artist Zhang Yujie was published in the "People's Daily," even the soldiers on the front line of the Yunnan-Burma Road wrote to Qianshang, hoping to obtain a piece of Zhang Yujie's paper-cutting. Soon, the dark, damp, and low cat-ear cave also saw the sun rising from the banks of the Qian River.

Xi'an Hotel. Here, the flow of foreign guests is large, and it can be considered a treasure land. Han Xuerun, the deputy leader of the Provincial Party Committee's team, who had been stationed in Nanzhai Township for a long time, led the newly established folk arts and crafts company of Nanzhai Township to step into this luxurious lobby with agility. They set up their stall and wanted to sell directly to foreigners here.

To avoid "failing," they used all their tricks: to let foreigners understand the introduction of Qianshang folk arts and crafts on TV, they translated the narration into English and played it synchronously with a tape recorder; team member Yang Yong'an asked his wife, Li Li, who speaks foreign languages, to stand at the counter and communicate with foreigners; Han Xuerun brought his son, who loves art, to design a 3-meter-high large advertisement and placed it outside the hotel door.

The exhibition began, and Han Xuerun's small notebook also became busy. A Thai person bought a "double fish lotus" wall hanging, and he recorded it in his notebook; a Japanese old lady bought 50 small cloth tigers, and he recorded it in his notebook; two British people pointed and discussed at the counter and left, and he also recorded it in his notebook.

After 10 days, the exhibition ended with a sales volume of 200,000 yuan, half of which was in foreign exchange, which can be considered a great success.

At this time, Han Xuerun's small notebook finally came to the final result: the sales to Japanese and Southeast Asian people were the best, followed by North America, except for France, Western Europe was relatively poor; foreign women, children, and artists liked it the most; Japanese people liked simplicity, and Arab people liked green...

The people of Qianshang obtained another very valuable foreign trade guide.

Now, Qianshang's folk arts and crafts have entered the international market through various channels, with an increasing influence. It is estimated that thousands of women in Qianshang County are engaged in folk arts and crafts either long-term or seasonally, and the county can now earn about 300,000 yuan in pure income per year. The highest earners can earn one or two thousand yuan per year.

A mere 300,000 yuan is not a significant figure for a county with a population of 110,000, far from achieving complete poverty alleviation and prosperity.

However, it is indeed an inspiring beginning. For the night, dawn certainly has extraordinary significance.

    太阳神的后裔
    邵文海
    这是极其惨烈且又极其壮丽的一幕——一颗熊熊的太阳突然自高天坠下，坠下……最后，轰然一声撞落在大地上。顷刻之间，不幸的太阳消失了，只留下一片溅落的残屑。
    于是，这一天便成了中华民族永久的忌日；
    于是，中华民族便世代相传着这样一个悲壮的故事：太阳神炎帝之死。
    太阳神玉碎了，那残屑呢？
    慢慢地，历史的尘灰覆掩了一切。
    1
    千阳，这个名字使人产生奇丽的幻觉——一千颗炫目的太阳在闪烁，在燃烧。
    然而，这个位于陕西西部的小县的现实却并不像幻境那样充满诗意。开天劈地的盘古，挥动着他的巨斧，从东到西劈出一条富饶的秦川。眼看就要到这里了，眼看只隔一道山岭了，神斧突然莫名其妙地失去了力量。
    于是，这里依然是山的领地。东有雍山，北有千山，西南有陇山。山，像沉重的枷锁，几千年来，一直禁锢着这里飞升的希望。
    历史衍进到20世纪80年代中叶，1985年11月3日，12名共产党员悄悄来到这里。他们是由陕西省委宣传部和省新闻出版局干部组成的省委扶贫工作队，领队的是省委宣传部和省新闻出版局的负责人。他们是来协助原在这里开展工作的共产党人搞脱贫致富的。
    车过千阳岭，底下是一幅令人百感交集的图景：山上少林，地下少矿，环顾四野，只有一片褐黄的贫困。
    “一定要干出一番事业！一定扎扎实实地为山区人民办点事！”
    不过，这些豪言壮语，并不能完全掩没他们心底的虚空。谁都知道，他们来自两个“清水衙门”，没钱没物没技术，扶贫，怎么个扶法？
    听取情况介绍，翻阅县志，调查访问，分头蹲点，宣讲文件，登台授课。这一切都是按部就班的，又是茫然的。谁也难以预料，他们将扶出一个什么样的局面。
    帮助县上制订“保姆战略”，协助抓企业管理，为水泥厂扩建工程联系200万元贷款，帮助快餐食品厂打入西安市场，甚至为困难户捐献钱粮衣物。一切都在逐步进行。
    该干的都干了，能干的都干了，但总缺点什么。
    也许是偶然，也许是必然，在柿沟乡蹲点的曹惠聪忽然在这山沟里发现了隐隐的光亮。他轻轻刨开历史的积尘，哦，那是一粒粒令人目眩的太阳：金灿灿，光闪闪。
    那是当地妇女的绣品。红布片，像太阳的火焰；金丝线，像太阳的光芒。绣品上常见的太阳图案，更在人们眼前展开一个灿烂的世界。
    小曹陶醉了。
    可是，多少年来，太阳却在白白地燃烧。纯朴的千阳人最多只用它来馈赠亲友。能不能用它来照亮千阳人的生活呢？
    千阳县民间工艺美术发展史上应当写上这一笔：1986年元月，省委扶贫工作队队员曹惠聪携着千阳工艺品，首次进入西安试销。
    春节前是旅游淡季，但省博物馆内外十分热闹。这一天，熙熙攘攘的人流中走着一位戴眼镜的青年，他个头不高，文静，腼腆，手里提着两个纸箱。
    他就是回来休假的小曹。
    小曹有了新发现，便开始往这方面动脑筋。当地一位30多岁的女共产党员徐有姐心灵手巧，敢闯敢干，他便鼓励她带个头。
    现在，他正提着徐有姐精湛的手艺，也提着她的信赖和柿沟人的期望前来探路。
    博物馆外有一个旅游服务部，摆着不少工艺品，小曹首先找到他们要求收购。他们看了看货，比玻璃柜上摆的好得多，价钱却压得很低，而且只代销。
    小曹又把纸箱提到一位专卖旅游纪念品的老太太摊子跟前。精明的老太太照样压价代销。
    就这样回去给柿沟人交待吗？
    小曹犹豫了一会儿，干脆摆起地摊。“不信好东西没人要。”
    那边走来两位外宾，看样子是夫妇。他们被虎头童鞋迷住了，叽哩咕噜说了好一阵。没想到，头一笔生意竟是“国际贸易”。外宾拿着虎头鞋满意地走了，又围上一群人，一连成交了四五件。这时，刚才那位精明的老太太扑了上来，把东西一揽：“我全要了，现钱。”
    货款带回柿沟，实在的山里人顿时来了兴趣。别看只卖了六七十块钱，是个好兆头哩！
    2
    1986年7月的一天，一辆小车冒着酷暑驶过千阳岭。
    来人是一位胖墩墩的老同志。他就是民间工艺美术专家靳子林。他应邀前来考察，论证千阳民间工艺美术。
      他正在研究“民俗民艺考古”理论，工作队负责人刘成章、雷涛星夜登门，一听他们对千阳工艺美术的描绘，他立即掂出了其中的分量。
    靳子林一头扎进千阳民间工艺美术作品，那里面有马烈梅精美的香袋、杨烈秀的鬼怪剪纸，有陈凤姐的蝴蝶荷包、吕让果的猫头挂片……一件件，都带有鲜明的原始图腾的意趣和特点，都带有仰韶文化的遗痕。
    他又钻进了历史文献和地方志中。史志中有这样的记载：炎帝生于千阳南80里处的蒙峪，因尝“火焰子”殁于蒙峪后的天台山；周兴于千阳东百余里处的周原；秦祖先曾经牧马于千河川……
    他又埋头于千阳县出土的仰韶时代的红陶罐残片中。陶片上的图纹与千阳民间工艺美术作品上的图饰十分相似：锯齿纹，太阳网格纹，鱼纹，蛙纹，波浪纹……千阳民间美术语言的内涵和新石器时代彩陶语言的内涵，有着共同的丰富性、规律性和一致性。
    一个遥远的图景在他的眼前渐渐走近，渐渐清晰——
    雪后初晴，整个氏族的人们一齐冲出洞穴，齐刷刷地匍匐在刚刚钻出阴云的太阳下。接着，他们又顶着太阳发狂地跳起舞来。那些勇猛的，剽悍的，用兽皮围着腰部的，手执石斧和弓箭的男人在跳；那些勤劳的，戴着兽牙项链的，使用骨针的女人也在跳。他们一边跳，一边发出旷野一样的呐喊与歌声，在苍茫的天穹回荡……
    他的心颤抖了。他把几十年的心血花在民间美术上，也许，今生最重大的发现将在这里问世。
    终于，他站起来，激动地宣布：这是太阳神炎帝氏族文化的沉积！
    “陕西有两个重要文化，一个是陕北的黄帝氏族文化，一个是宝鸡一带的炎帝氏族文化。以太阳崇拜为特点的炎帝氏族文化的发祥地就在宝鸡一带，这里可能是炎帝文化的源头。”靳子林给省委工作队的队员们讲着。
    工作队员们喜出望外。
    “文物有地上文物和地下文物之分，民间工艺美术就是地上文物。进入千阳县，就像进了一个很大的历史博物馆，每一张剪纸，每一幅刺绣都向我们说明了年代，证明这里是炎帝氏族文化。”他给千阳县的干部们讲着。
    千阳县的干部们雀跃欢呼。
    “中华民族妇女对中国文化发展作出了重大贡献，对人类文明也作出了重大贡献。千阳的艺术是我们老祖先留下来的宝贝，咱们都是太阳神的后裔，要把它发扬光大。”他给千阳近百名女艺人作报告时如此这般。
    女艺人们欣喜若狂。
    3
    在信息年代，新颖的词汇层出不穷。1986年9月，西安美院工艺系的工作会上，蹦出了一个崭新的名词——文化扶贫。
    这月中旬，在省委宣传部专门召开的千阳民间艺术座谈会后，西安美院工艺系的28名教师，应省工作队之邀，在系主任樊文江教授带领下来到了千阳。他们的任务是探求文化扶贫之路。
    偏僻的千阳，从未一次来过这么多专家。小城轰动了。
    这就是千阳民间工艺美术，粗犷明朗，古朴浑厚，既不同于陕北洛川的整体大气，也不同于邻县凤翔的修饰多彩。它是那样富有个性，独具特色，一件件，都可以追溯到远古。
    远古的回声在这里轰响，这回声，使这些在民间艺术之海里沉浮多年的专家们也惊叹不止。
    同时，他们的心也是沉重的。他们比谁都清楚，民间艺术的纯正恰恰是以封闭和落后这个巨大的代价换来的。
    一位副教授这样写道：“由于地域、自然、人文的种种缘故，千阳的经济是封闭型的，传统审美观念也是封闭型的，因而不少工艺品截至目前仍较多地保留着古代民间艺术的痕迹。”
    因为封闭，灿烂的太阳神文化才在这里躲过了外来文化和宫廷文化的“侵袭”和“污染”。当太阳的残屑在有的地方熄灭于外来文化的风暴时，这里却隐埋下了它的火种。
    也正因为封闭，千阳才没有受到外来文化的影响，躲过了经济、文化发展浪潮的冲击，落伍于社会前进的队列。
    历史的风沙在千阳岭的岩壁上，冲刷出一幅残酷的图景：千阳人为中华民族保存了灿烂的千阳民间工艺美术，但也为自己保存了长期的贫穷和落后。
    如何在继续挖掘、继承、保护的同时，把千阳工艺引进现代生活中来，使之具有生产规模，成为脱贫致富的一条途径呢？如何既保持民间艺术的原有特色，而又注入现代意识，使之和时代同步呢？年过花甲的工艺系主任樊文江教授一连几天都在与工作队同志商讨这个问题。
    于是，“千艺行动”——又一个迸发着时代之光的新创词汇诞生了。
    于是，在陈启南院长和刘文西副院长的大力支持下，他把两个班的学生拉到千阳，一方面进行现场教学，一方面与工作队一起对民间艺人培训，并帮助他们创制新作——“千艺行动”开始了。
    4
    一根根针牵着金丝翻飞，忽上忽下，令人眼花缭乱。忽然，那金丝线上竟串满了金币。金光闪闪的金币，叮当作响的金币……
    这当然是个梦幻。这个梦幻的拥有者是千阳县南寨乡乡长李景峰。
    他是一个农民般朴实的干部，有一颗与农民相通的心，也有为农民谋利益的气魄和热肠。
    此时，“千艺行动”的序幕已在千阳拉开，主战场就在南寨。他和他的同事，乡党委书记阎拴太是“千艺行动”最积极的响应者和支持者。
    民间工艺不需要大的投资，只要有针有线，坐在炕头上就可以干。不怕紧缩银根，风险少，见效快，更重要的是家家户户可以直接获利……他越想越美，摸着刮得发青的下巴乐了。那个近乎荒诞的梦幻一直萦绕脑际。
    “一根针，一根线，要穿起千家万户的钱串串。”当他用这生动形象的语言，给1000多名村民代表传达了他的梦幻后，村民代表会顿时化作一片梦幻之海。
    针线穿起的，还有这样一些动人的事迹——
    乡上率先创办了“千阳县民间工艺美术公司”。公司在省工作队和美院李文忠老师支持下，
  “练精兵，搞精品”。现在，“精兵”已达1500多人，“绣女之乡”遐迩闻名。
    按照规划，他们从一开始就按村，按组向专业化发展。有的村擅长做壁挂，有的村擅长做五毒马夹，有的擅长绣龙绣凤，恰似工厂的车间，医院的科室。一有订货，即按专长分派，有条不紊。
    公司办有一个工艺美术品展览，乡上每逢大小会议，参观这个展览都是会议的一项重要内容。
    乡村干部把民间艺人作为联系户，专人负责，帮助这些“致富的带头人”和“艺术的传播者”解除后顾之忧。
    张玉姐，这位年近五旬的农村妇女，有一手剪纸绝技。乡上把她列为重点艺人，把她的剪纸视作拳头产品。她家院子窄小，居住困难，乡上优先给她批了院基；她身体孱弱，乡上补助她50元，民政干事一直送到家里。1987年年初，她和吕让果又一道被选为县人大代表，参议全县大政。
    这一切，都因为南寨上空飘浮着一个令人神往的梦幻。
    5
    就在“千艺行动”开始的同时，陕西省委的第二期扶贫工作队一行16人也来到了千阳。
    那时的太阳，刚从历史的积尘中刨出，它的光芒尚未突出四围的山岭。于是，《巧剪春花沁土香》、《千阳绣女徐有姐》、《千阳春色美》等一篇篇报道，先后在《人民日报》、《陕西日报》、《支部生活》等报刊上刊出了；一本几万字的《千阳民间美术资料汇编》很快征集、编纂完成了；他们联系省电视台拍摄的千阳工艺专题片播放了。
    终于，千阳民间工艺美术在外界开始有了一些名气。特别是副队长韩学润采写的记叙剪纸女艺人张玉姐的文章《巧剪春花沁土香》在《人民日报》上刊载后，连老山前线战士都投书千阳，渴望得到一帧张玉姐的剪纸。很快，阴暗、潮湿、低矮的猫耳洞里，也腾起了来自千河畔的太阳。
    西安宾馆。这里外宾客流量大，堪称一块宝地。一直在南寨乡蹲点的省工作队副队长韩学润，带领着南寨乡刚成立的民间工艺美术公司，机敏地踏进了这个豪华的门厅。他们摆开阵势，要在这里直接向外宾销售。
    为了不“砸锅”，他们使出了浑身解数：为让外宾看懂介绍千阳民间工艺美术的电视片，他们把片子说明词译成英语，用录音机同步播放；队员杨永安请来会外语的爱人李莉站柜台，与外宾会话；韩学润拉来爱好美术的儿子设计了一个3米多高的大广告竖在宾馆门外。
    展销开始了，韩学润的小笔记本也开始忙碌了。一位泰国人购了一件“双鱼摆莲”壁挂，他在本子上记着；一位日本老太太购了50只小布虎，他在本子上记着；两位英国人在柜台前指指点点一番后离去，他也在本子上记着。
    10天，展销结束，售额2万，其中一半是外汇，可谓大获全胜。
    这时，韩学润的小笔记本也终于得出了最后的结果：对日本和东南亚人销路最好，北美次之，除法国外西欧较差；外国妇女、儿童和艺术家最喜爱；日本人喜欢素净，阿拉伯人喜欢绿色……
    千阳人又获得了一份极宝贵的外销指导资料。
    现在，千阳民间工艺美术品已通过各种渠道打入国际市场，影响越来越大。据估算，千阳全县已有几千名妇女或长年或季节性地从事民间工艺美术，全县现在一年可获得约30万元的纯收入。最多者每年可收入一二千元。
    区区30万元，对于一个有着11万人口的县来说，不是什么大不了的数字，远谈不上彻底脱贫致富。
    但是，它毕竟是一个令人振奋的开端。对于夜晚来说，黎明当然有着非凡的意义。
