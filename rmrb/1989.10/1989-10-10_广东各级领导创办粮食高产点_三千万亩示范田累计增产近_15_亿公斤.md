Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 9th. (Reporter: Ye Jundong) Leaders at various levels in Guangdong have gone deep into the grassroots to establish high-yield grain demonstration points, promoting the development of grain production. From 1987 to the present, leaders at various levels have established 30 million mu of high-yield grain demonstration points, cumulatively increasing grain production by nearly 1.5 billion kilograms.

According to incomplete statistics, in this year's early rice high-yield creation activities alone, 710 leaders at the provincial, municipal, and county levels, including Party committee secretaries, mayors, agricultural commission directors, and agricultural bureau chiefs, participated in establishing early rice high-yield demonstration points, covering an area of 3.867 million mu, which is 17% of the total early rice area. From 1987 to the present, the cumulative area of high-yield grain demonstration points established by leaders at various levels has reached 30 million mu. According to sampling surveys by relevant departments, the grain yield increase in these high-yield demonstration points is generally 25 to 80 kilograms per mu, with the highest reaching 100 kilograms, and an average increase of 49.5 kilograms per mu. Over three years, the cumulative grain increase has reached nearly 1.5 billion kilograms.

The establishment of high-yield demonstration points by leaders has driven the province-wide mass grain high-yield creation activities. This year, the province's early rice high-yield creation activities covered an area of 7.8 million mu, accounting for 33.8% of the total early rice area. The development of grain high-yield creation activities has promoted grain production in various places. Shaoguan City has established a cumulative area of more than 1.3 million mu of grain high-yield demonstration points over three years, increasing rice production by 97.5 million kilograms, and has moved from a low-yield area to the forefront of high-yield areas in the province.

    广东各级领导创办粮食高产点
    三千万亩示范田累计增产近15亿公斤
    新华社广州10月9日电（记者叶俊东）广东省各级领导干部深入基层办粮食高产示范点，推动粮食生产的发展。自1987年至今，各级领导干部共办粮食高产示范点3000万亩，累计增产粮食近15亿公斤。
    据不完全统计，仅在今年早稻创高产活动中，广东省市、县两级的党委书记、市（县）长、农委主任、农业局长等领导干部就有710人参办早稻高产点，面积达386.7万亩，占早稻总面积的17％。从1987年到现在，各级领导创办粮食高产示范点面积累计达3000万亩。据有关部门抽样调查，这些高产示范点粮食增产幅度一般为每亩25至80公斤，最高达100公斤，平均亩增产49.5公斤，3年累计增产粮食近15亿公斤。
    领导干部创办高产示范点，带动了全省群众性的粮食创高产活动。今年全省早稻开展粮食创高产活动的面积达780万亩，占早稻总面积的33.8％。粮食创高产活动的开展，促进了各地的粮食生产。韶关市办粮食高产示范点3年累计面积达130多万亩，共增产稻谷97.5亿公斤，已由全省的低产区跨入高产区前列。
