China's football team played a 1-1 draw with the Soviet Union's Odessa Black Sea team in their final warm-up match before the Singapore showdown in Guangzhou tonight.

The starting lineup for the Chinese team last night was: goalkeeper Fu Yubin, defenders Zhu Bo, Guo Yijun, Gao Sheng, Dong Liqiang, Duan Ju, midfielders Tang Yaodong, Xie Yuxin, Mai Chao, forwards Wu Qunli, and Liu Haiguang. In the second half, Wu Wenbing and Ma Lin replaced Tang Yaodong and Xie Yuxin, respectively. The most anticipated performance was that of the new backup goalkeeper Fu Yubin, following the injury of the starting goalkeeper Zhang Huikang. Fu Yubin successfully saved three crucial shots that seemed certain to score. Notably, with just 20 seconds left in the game, he bravely blocked a powerful shot from the opponent's forward in the penalty area. The goal conceded by the Black Sea team in the 7th minute of the second half was due to a miscommunication between Fu Yubin and the defenders.

In this match, the Chinese team employed a strategy of expanding their defensive area and counter-attacking opportunities, frequently shooting from long distances to test the opponent's goal. In the 33rd minute of the first half, the Chinese team made a cross pass in the forward area. Gao Sheng, under heavy pressure from the opponent's defense, suddenly shot from over 30 meters away. The ball deflected off an opponent's foot and went over the goalkeeper's head into the net.

    赴新加坡决战前羊城热身
    中国足球队战平黑海人队
    本报广州10月5日电　中国足球队今晚在广州进行狮城决战前的最后一场热身赛，与苏联敖德萨黑海人队1比1踢平。
    中国队昨晚出场阵容是：守门员傅玉斌，后卫朱波、郭亿军、高升、董礼强、段举，前卫唐尧东、谢育新、麦超，前锋吴群立、柳海光。下半时先后由伍文兵、马林替下唐尧东、谢育新。最受观众关注的是主力门将张惠康受伤之后，新的替补门将傅玉斌的表现。傅玉斌曾先后三次扑出对方眼看必入之球。其中终场前20秒奋勇封堵了对方前锋小禁区角的一记有力近射。至于黑海人队下半时7分钟的破门，则是傅玉斌与后卫配合不当的原因。
    在这场比赛中，中国队以扩大防区、伺机反击的打法与黑海人队周旋，并频频远射敲击对方大门。上半时33分钟，中国队前场横传转移，高升在对方密集防守之下，于30多米远外突然起脚，球碰对方后卫的脚弹起，越过门将头顶入网。（陈士军）
