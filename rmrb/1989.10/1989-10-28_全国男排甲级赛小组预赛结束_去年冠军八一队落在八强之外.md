After 5 days of intense group preliminary matches, the top eight teams for the 1989 National Men's Volleyball League were decided tonight. The eight teams are: Nanjing Military Region Team, Shanghai Team, Fujian Team, Tianjin Team, Hubei Team, Henan Team, Liaoning Team, and Sichuan Team. Last year's league champion, Team August First, was defeated tonight by the team that finished 17th in last year's league, the Nanjing Military Region Team, and failed to advance to the top eight. Additionally, they did not secure a spot in next year's League A group matches.

This year's National Men's Volleyball League A Group features 20 teams, with matches starting on October 23rd and being held in Nanjing and Yangzhou. Due to regulations that carry over group stage results to the finals and relegation, each team fought fiercely over the 5-day group stage, resulting in multiple 2-3 match outcomes. Only powerhouses Fujian and Hubei maintained undefeated records.

Zhou Zhihua, former head coach of the national men's volleyball team, who came from Beijing to watch the matches, said, "Although the national men's volleyball team roster has been finalized, we still hope to discover new talents in this competition."

The league will take a one-day break tomorrow. On the 29th, the top eight teams will compete in a round-robin format in Nanjing, while the other 12 teams will battle it out in Yangzhou to determine their rankings.

　　全国男排甲级赛小组预赛结束
　　去年冠军八一队落在八强之外
    本报南京10月27日电　经过5天激烈的小组预赛，1989年全国男排甲级联赛今晚决出八强。这八个队是：南京部队队、上海队、福建队、天津队、湖北队、河南队、辽宁队、四川队。去年联赛冠军八一队今晚被去年联赛第17名的南京部队队战败，未能进入八强圈，且参加明年甲级联赛A组比赛的资格亦未到手。
    今年全国男排甲级队联赛共有20个队参加，比赛于本月23日开始，分别在南京和扬州两地进行分组预赛。由于有小组赛成绩带入决赛和降组的规定，因此，在5天时间的小组预赛中，各队都奋力拚斗，角逐激烈，出现多个2∶3的场次，只有劲旅福建和湖北队保持全胜。
    从北京前来观赛的中国男排前主教练邹志华说，虽国家男排阵容已定，但仍想在此次比赛中发现新的战将。
    明天，联赛将休赛一天。29日，八强将在南京展开单循环战，另12支队伍将在扬州分组鏖战，以排座次。　（刘曙光）
