The Xiang opera "The Song of the Guardians," which reflects the Beijing Spring Uprising, premiered here on the evening of October 10.

This opera was created and performed by the Xiang Opera Troupe of Xiangtan City, Hunan Province. It depicts how the platoon leader Liu Weiguo of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army abruptly halted his wedding ceremony and, with his unit, marched to Beijing to carry out martial law duties. His younger sister, Liu Xiaohua, who was attending university, went to Beijing and got involved in the counterrevolutionary rebellion. However, just as Liu Xiaohua was shouting "We want democracy, we want freedom," her brother was burned to death by rioters while on duty.

Witnessing the truth of the rebellion, Liu Xiaohua had a sudden realization and repented.
