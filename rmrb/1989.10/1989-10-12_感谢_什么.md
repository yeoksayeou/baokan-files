A good teacher cultivates excellent students, providing guidance, instruction, and clarification. As a student, one should express gratitude. A leader helps a couple resolve the issue of living apart, bridging the gap, so the couple should express their thanks. An editor discovers a novel idea but rough draft and meticulously refines it. When the author receives the proof, they will feel a surge of gratitude from the heart… This leads to contemplating the level of integrity in anti-corruption efforts.

People living in society inevitably help others and receive help from others. The dual nature of assistance leads to the dual nature of gratitude. From ancient times to the present, it has always been so.

So, what should one "thank" for?

During the Eastern Han Dynasty, Yang Zhen recommended "Jingzhou's talented scholar Wang Mi as the magistrate of Changyi," showing him favor. When Yang "passed through Changyi," Wang Mi, to express his gratitude, secretly sent Yang ten pounds of gold. This is a typical example of expressing gratitude with money. The upright Yang Zhen then guided the expression of gratitude correctly with his famous "four knowledges," causing Mi to withdraw in shame. (See "Zizhi Tongjian," page 1580).

During the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Tang Dynasty, Guan Neng's uncle, Guan Xingquan, and his entire family of 35 people were falsely accused and imprisoned, awaiting execution. The official Tang Xi spoke up to the Three Prefectures Military Commissioner Chen Jingxuan, pointing out that "this must have a reason." After investigation, it was found that "Guan Xingquan indeed had good fields, and the prefect wanted to buy them, but he refused, so he harbored resentment." Thus, the truth of the false accusation was revealed. To express gratitude for Tang Xi's few words of life-saving kindness, "Guan secretly sent Tang Xi 100 taels of gold," also expressing gratitude with money. However, the upright Tang Xi gave a different guidance to the expression of gratitude compared to Yang Zhen. "This is due to the kindness and wisdom of the Grand Preceptor, what does it have to do with me? You are bringing disaster by giving gifts!" (See "Zizhi Tongjian," pages 8282–8283). That is, the life-saving kindness is not mine, but the kindness and wisdom of Chen Jingxuan (Chen then held the title of "Grand Preceptor"). This directs the gratitude towards the superior or the superior's superior, which is one aspect; viewing the gift as bringing disaster, meaning both parties would be harmed. I fully agree with the latter point, but the former seems limited by history and lacks a bit of elevation, saying one should thank the fairness of the law! How good that would be!

Even choosing two examples from history shows that although giving gratitude with money has been present since ancient times, there have also been enlightened individuals who prevent minor issues from becoming major ones. Today, this historical mirror also reflects two distinct souls: foul and fragrant, ugly and beautiful. A certain leader, Leader A, called Leader B like this: "Your son's promotion was something I helped with, and my daughter is under your command, you must… ha ha!" This is "reciprocating kindness" in the form of gratitude, but it is actually a trade, still a kind of indirect "money" or power exchange. Even worse, some people have not even started helping, but first discuss the "price" of gratitude. If even a single cent is missing, they will say "goodbye" and leave. Such gratitude deviates from the correct moral norms and is infuriating!

What should one "thank" for? I strongly advocate for gratitude that focuses on the spiritual aspect, such as using words to sincerely thank the helper; or writing a sincere letter of thanks to the helper or their unit; or saying, "Don't thank me, thank the little bit of Lei Feng spirit I learned," "The party and the people need us all to do this," etc., directing gratitude towards the party and the people's nurturing. The intention is to let both parties be inspired or motivated by "every branch and leaf is connected with affection," letting gratitude become a "lubricant" for harmonious interpersonal relationships, and a "booster" for the helped party to work hard. Then, gratitude will enter a new level, a level of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me." I think, this might be where today's people surpass Yang Zhen and Tang Xi.

    “感谢”什么
    陈升钧
    良师培养高徒，有“传道，授业，解惑”之劳，做徒弟的当要表示感谢；领导帮助一对夫妇解决了两地分居问题，有搭“鹊桥”之恩，这对夫妇当要表达感谢之情；当编辑的，发现了一篇立意新但写得稍嫌粗糙的作品，便精心加工润色，当作者收到样报之时会从心底涌出一番感谢之意……由此想到廉政建设的境界之高下。
    人在社会中生活，难免有帮助别人的时候，亦有接受别人帮助的时候。帮助的双向性导致“感谢”的双向性。从古至今，莫不如此。
    那么“感谢”什么呢？
    东汉杨震因推荐“荆州茂才王密为昌邑令”有恩，当杨“道经昌邑”时，王密为“感谢”，便“夜怀金十斤以遗震”。这是以钱“感谢”的一个典型。一贯廉洁的杨震便以著名的“四知”给“感谢”以正确导向，致“密愧而出”，（《资治通鉴》1580页）。
    唐僖宗时期，阡能的叔父阡行全家35人遭人陷害被捕入狱，准备处决。孔目官唐溪直言三川节度使陈敬瑄，指出“此必有故”。经调查，“果行全有良田，刺史欲买之，不与，故恨之。”至此蒙冤真相大白。为“感谢”唐溪几句话的救命大恩，“密饷溪蚀箔金百两”，亦是以钱“感谢”。然而，廉洁的唐溪给予的“感谢”导向与杨震有所不同，“此乃太师仁明，何预吾事，汝乃怀祸相饷乎！”（《资治通鉴》8282—8283页），即救命之恩不在“吾”，而在陈敬瑄（当时陈有“检校太师”的官衔）的“仁明”，把“感谢”导向上司或上司的上司，此其一；把“相饷”视为“怀祸”，即“揣着灾祸来赠送”，岂不双方受害么？此其二。这两点，后者我极为赞同，前者受历史的局限，似乎境界有点不够高，说应“感谢”法律的公正！这有多好！
    仅择出历史的两斑，便说明虽然给“感谢”注入金钱财物至上的铜臭味的古已有之，但亦不乏有防微杜渐的开明之士。现今，这面面历史的镜子亦照出两种迥异的灵魂：臭和香，丑与美。有位领导甲给领导乙这样打电话：“你公子的提拔是我帮助解决的，我的千金在你手下，你得……哈哈！”这是“投桃报李”的“感谢”，实则交换也，搞的仍是一种无形的变相的“金钱”或权力交易。更有甚者，有人帮助尚未实施，却先谈“感谢”的价码，少一个子儿，便“拜拜”而去。这样的“感谢”背离了正确的道德规范，令人愤然！
    “感谢”什么？我极力推崇的是着眼于精神方面的“感谢”方式，或用言语向帮助者道声亲切的“谢谢”；或向帮助者或其所在单位写封诚挚的“感谢信”；或“不用谢我，要谢谢我曾学得的一点雷锋精神”，“党和人民需要我们都这样做”等等，把“感谢”转向党和人民的哺育，用意是让双方皆受到“一枝一叶总关情”的启迪或激励，让“感谢”成为融洽人际关系的“润滑剂”，成为激发被帮助一方努力工作的“助进器”，那“感谢”便进入到一个新的层次，我为人人、人人为我的境界。我想，这也许是今人超过杨震、唐溪之处吧。
