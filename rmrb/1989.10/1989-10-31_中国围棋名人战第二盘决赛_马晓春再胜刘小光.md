　　中国围棋名人战第二盘决赛
　　马晓春再胜刘小光
    本报郑州10月30日电　记者吴骅报道：马晓春九段今天执白中盘战胜了上届名人刘小光，取得第二届中国围棋名人战决赛第二盘的胜利，并以2∶0领先。这一战绩使前来香江大酒楼观战的数百棋迷失望。
    上午开局后，执黑先行的刘小光落子果断，充满自信。马晓春从容对应，毫不慌乱。战至封盘，双方竟下了70手棋，令观战者甚为吃惊。盘面上黑棋攻势咄咄逼人，略占上风。下午，双方你攻我守，均无大的失误，局势错综复杂，令人难以判断。在黑棋左上角处，白棋力图打入黑棋领地，马晓春114手竟使刘小光未能注意，这一妙手使白棋成先手，顿时局势逆转，黑棋转优为劣。随后，黑棋左突右冲，力图挽回败势，但白棋滴水不漏，始终占据主动。黑棋无奈，只好中盘告负。
    这一盘比赛，使挑战者马晓春向新名人称号迈出了决定性的一步。
    第三盘比赛，11月1日仍在郑州举行。
