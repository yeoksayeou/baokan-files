This year marks the 50th anniversary of the victory at the Battle of Yan Suo Cliff and Huangtu Ridge. To honor the revolutionary martyrs, Hebei Province's Laiyuan County has constructed the "Yan Suo Cliff and Huangtu Ridge Victory Memorial" at the site of the historic battle. The memorial features an inscription by Marshal Nie Rongzhen, the former commander of the battle. On the Double Ninth Festival, local Young Pioneers paid tribute to the revolutionary martyrs by presenting them with flowers.

    今年是雁宿崖黄土岭战役胜利50周年。为了缅怀革命先烈，河北省涞源县在当年鏖战过的黄土岭故地修建了“雁宿崖黄土岭战役胜利纪念碑”，并请当年的老司令员聂荣臻元帅题写了碑文。重阳佳节，当地的少先队员向革命先烈敬献鲜花。
