The Great Wall is a symbol of the wisdom and strength of the Chinese people, a great creation of the Chinese working class. In 1987, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) officially listed the Great Wall as a World Heritage Site. As a historical and cultural heritage of all humanity, the Great Wall is not only protected by the Chinese people but also attracts the attention of the world.

However, there are some people who, against all reason, have actually destroyed sections of the Great Wall, using the bricks to build houses, enclosures, and even toilets. Such despicable acts of desecration are truly infuriating!

The state has long enacted the Cultural Relics Protection Law. The current issue is that laws must be strictly enforced. For instance, those responsible for damaging the Great Wall must be investigated and severely punished. Moreover, not only should the perpetrators be held accountable, but those responsible for failing to protect cultural relics and for not properly investigating illegal activities should also be held accountable. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage's handling of this matter is not just about protecting a section of the Great Wall; it is about establishing a national consciousness of protecting cultural relics in accordance with the law. Only in this way can the dignity of the Cultural Relics Protection Law be maintained, and similar incidents can be prevented from happening again.

### 毁长城者必究

    毁长城者必究
    长城，是中华民族智慧、力量的象征，是我国劳动人民的伟大创造。1987年，联合国教科文组织将长城正式列入世界遗产目录。作为全人类的历史文化遗产，长城不仅受到中国人民的保护，也受到了全世界的关注。
    然而，竟有那么一些败家子，居然冒天下之大不韪，拆毁长城墙，用长城砖建房、垒圈，甚至盖厕所。这种亵渎文明的恶劣行径，真是令人愤慨！
    国家早就颁布了文物保护法。现在的问题是，有了法就要坚决依法办事。比如，对毁坏长城墙的事件就必须查究，严惩不贷。而且，不仅要追究当事者，还应当追究那些保护文物不力、对违法事件查办不力的有关人员的责任。国家文物局抓这件事，其意义远不只限于对一段长城的保护，而是要树立全民依法保护文物的观念。只有这样，才能维护文物保护法的尊严，也才能杜绝类似事件的发生。
