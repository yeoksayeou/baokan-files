Huguang County, located in the heart of the Taihang Mountains, has been honored as the "Vanguard County for Greening the Taihang Mountains." Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the county has had four consecutive county committee secretaries who have taken on the responsibility of greening the area. As a result, the forest coverage rate has increased from 2.3% to 19.2%.

Huguang, a poverty-stricken county nestled in the Taihang Mountains, has over 70% of its land covered by barren hills and gullies. Since 1979, the county committee and government have had four changes in county committee secretaries and county magistrates. However, the collective decision to green the area has remained unchanged. The county committee, county government, and five major leadership teams, consisting of 20 leaders, each took responsibility for greening a township. The county and townships signed greening responsibility agreements.

Over the past decade, 23 million trees have been planted, and 68,000 mu (approximately 4,533 hectares) of economic forests have been developed, with an average of over one mu per household. The total output value of the forestry industry has reached 9.58 million yuan, accounting for 25% of the total agricultural output value. The Shanxi Provincial Government has awarded Huguang County the title of "Vanguard County for Greening the Taihang Mountains" and has promoted their experiences.

    壶关被誉为“绿化太行山先锋县”
    本报太原十月八日电  记者王艾生报道：山西省壶关县从党的十一届三中全会以来，连续四任县委书记都挑起绿化重担，使全县森林覆盖率由过去的百分之二点三上升为百分之十九点二。
    壶关，这个地处太行山腹地的贫困县，荒山沟坡占土地面积百分之七十以上。一九七九年以来，县委、县政府连续更换四任县委书记、四任县长，但县委集体作出的绿化决策始终没有变。壶关县委、县政府等五大班子二十名领导干部，每人包一个乡镇，县对乡签定绿化责任状。
    近十年来栽植四旁树二千三百万株，发展经济林六点八万亩，户均一亩多。林业总产值达九百五十八万元，占农业总产值的百分之二十五。山西省政府授予壶关县“绿化太行山先锋县”称号，并推广他们的经验。
