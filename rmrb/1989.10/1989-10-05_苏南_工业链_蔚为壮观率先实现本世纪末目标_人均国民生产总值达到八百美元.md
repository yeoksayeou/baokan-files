Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 4th.

In southern Jiangsu Province, centered around the cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, an impressive "industrial chain" has emerged. Driven by this "industrial chain," this region has become one of the areas with the fastest economic development and the highest degree of industrialization in the 40 years since the founding of New China.

This "industrial chain," located between the Yangtze River and Lake Tai, stretches from Wujin County in Changzhou City to Kunshan County in Suzhou City, covering over a hundred kilometers. Along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the Jiangnan Grand Canal, and the densely packed roads in this narrow strip of land, there are more than 35,000 large, medium, and small enterprises. These enterprises currently produce an annual industrial output value of 90 billion yuan and contribute 5 billion yuan to the national fiscal revenue. According to statistics from 1988, this region has already achieved the goal of a per capita GDP of 800 US dollars, a target set for the end of the century.

The rise of this massive "industrial chain" in southern Jiangsu is a remarkable achievement in the development of socialist commodity economy since liberation, especially since the reform and opening up.

    苏南“工业链”蔚为壮观率先实现本世纪末目标
    人均国民生产总值达到八百美元
    据新华社南京10月4日电（记者张行端）在我国江苏省南部，以苏州、无锡、常州三个市为中心，形成了一条蔚为壮观的“工业链”。由于这条“工业链”的带动，这里已成为新中国成立40年来我国经济发展最迅速、工业化程度最高的地区之一。
    这条位于长江和太湖之间的“工业链”，西起常州市武进县，东至苏州市昆山县，绵亘上百公里。在这条狭长地带上，沿沪宁铁路、江南运河和公路密布了35000多家大、中、小企业。这些企业现时一年创造出900亿元的工业产值，为国家提供50亿元的财政积累。按1988年的统计资料计算，这里已率先实现了我国预定在本世纪末才能达到的人均国民生产总值800美元的目标。
    江苏南部崛起的这一巨形“工业链”，是解放以来特别是改革开放以来，发展社会主义商品经济所取得的显赫成果。
