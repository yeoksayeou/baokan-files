The following is an excerpt from a letter written by the Party Committee Secretary of Yazi Port Township in Hanshou County, Hunan Province, reflecting on his drinking and feasting habits and addressing the issue to all township cadres:

I have a history of drinking and smoking for over 20 years. Reflecting on this, I realize that a significant portion of the cigarettes and alcohol I have consumed was paid for with the blood and sweat of the people. Especially in the past two years, whenever I visited an enterprise, unit, village, or group, comrades would always warmly receive me, naturally offering cigarettes and alcohol. The cigarettes have evolved from one at a time to packs and cartons. The alcohol has progressed from "sorghum liquor" to branded spirits. Each year, the amount spent on cigarettes and alcohol for entertaining me and my accompanying comrades is not less than one thousand yuan. Because I did not take this matter seriously, it led to cadres in all enterprises, departments, villages, and groups in the township following suit. According to incomplete statistics, the township spends at least fifty thousand yuan each year just on gifts and entertainment involving cigarettes and alcohol. Meanwhile, how do the farmers live? Although their economic lives have improved somewhat in recent years, many farmers' lives are still at the level of just filling their stomachs. A few chickens or eggs have to be taken to the market to exchange for a few coins. Many people consider twenty or thirty yuan as a significant amount of money, wrapping it in cloth in multiple layers, even if there is a sick person at home, they hesitate to spend the money. But for the sake of camaraderie, showing off, and building relationships, we wave our hands and spend thirty yuan on a pack of cigarettes, five or six yuan on a bottle of alcohol... I can't continue writing here. The people are indeed unhappy with our behavior, from whispering behind our backs to openly protesting. If we let this continue, what kind of consequences will it lead to? What will the relationship between the Party and the people develop into? Will our cadres still have the right to speak, and will they have the authority to lead the people?

### 一个吃喝干部的反省

    一个吃喝干部的反省
    这里转载的是湖南省汉寿县鸭子港乡党委书记写给全乡干部对自己吃喝问题进行反省的信（摘录）：
    我是一个有20多年喝酒抽烟历史的人了，反省起来，在这些烟酒中确有不少是用人民群众的血汗钱买来的。特别是近两年来，我每到一个企业单位、村组，同志们总是热情接待，自然递烟敬酒。烟由过去一根接一根，发展到一包包、一条条。酒由过去的“高粱小曲”发展到名酒。每年用于招待我和我的随行同志身上的烟酒不少于千元。由于我对此事没有严肃对待，导致全乡各企业部门、各村、组的干部效而行之。据不完全统计，每年全乡仅送人情、招待烟酒一项至少要花掉五万元。而农民生活又怎样呢？虽然近些年来经济生活有了些改善，但仍有部分农民的生活只达到饱肚子的程度，几只鸡、几个蛋都要拿到市场上换几个钱。不少人视二三十元为一笔家当，用布包上几层，即使家里有病人也舍不得花钱。而我们为了讲义气、摆阔气、拉关系，一挥手一条烟30元，一瓶酒五六元……我写到这里写不下去了。群众对我们这种行为确实不满，由背后议论到公开抗议。任其发展，将会出现一种甚么恶果，党群之间的关系将会发展到一个什么样的地步？我们的干部还有什么权利来说话，还有什么威信去领导群众？
