Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 7th.

East Germany solemnly celebrated the 40th anniversary of its founding with a grand ceremony held on October 6th in the afternoon at the Palace of the Republic in Berlin. East German leader Erich Honecker and other dignitaries attended the event. Ma Yepin, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the ceremony and the parade as the head of the Chinese party and government delegation.

In his speech, Honecker stated that 40 years ago, the first workers' and peasants' state was established on German soil. Today, the German Democratic Republic has become one of the world's top 10 advanced countries and one of the 20 countries with the highest living standards. This is the result of the hard work of the people of East Germany under the leadership of the working class and its party. He emphasized that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany will continue to adhere to Marxism, considering both the country's specific conditions and the experiences of other socialist countries in socialist construction. East Germany will continue to implement the policy of combining continuity with innovation, finding appropriate ways to solve problems, and achieving faster development than capitalism. He pointed out that young people should be better educated to understand the true nature of Western capitalist societies, which are "golden on the outside but rotten on the inside."

Honecker stressed the necessity of finding new solutions to problems arising in the new situation. He said that East Germany is fully capable of solving its own problems. The idea of solving problems by abolishing socialism is a bad one. He also emphasized that it is not permissible to use documents such as the Helsinki Accords to undermine socialism. The principles of respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs must be strictly adhered to.

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who was invited to participate in the celebrations, addressed the gathering. He praised East Germany's achievements over the past 40 years under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Gorbachev said that East Germany, like any other country, of course, has its own development problems that need to be carefully considered and solutions found. Both the continuous development of domestic needs and the modernization and reform process of the entire socialist camp must be taken into account. He had no doubt that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, as the leading force in society, could, with its wisdom, experience, and political authority, cooperate with all sectors of society to find answers to the problems.

Other foreign leaders attending the celebration included Jaruzelski, Ceaușescu, Zhivkov, Jakub, Batmonh, Nguyen Van Linh, and Stoph.

The celebration ended with the entire audience singing the "Internationale."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 7th, the National People's Army of East Germany held a grand military parade on Karl Marx Allee to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. Ma Yepin was invited to attend and watch the parade.

    民德隆重庆祝建国四十周年
    昂纳克强调坚持社会主义道路  姚依林应邀出席大会和阅兵式
    本报柏林10月7日电　记者许宏治报道：庆祝德意志民主共和国成立40周年大会10月6日下午在柏林共和国宫隆重举行。民主德国领导人昂纳克等和各界人士一起参加了大会。中国党政代表团团长、中共中央政治局常委、国务院副总理姚依林和民德党和国家领导人一起在主席台前排就座。
    昂纳克在讲话中说，40年前，德意志土地上第一个工农国家成立了，今天，民主德国已成为世界10大先进国家之一、世界上20个生活水平最高的国家之一。这是民德人民在工人阶级及其政党领导下辛勤劳动的结果。他强调，德国统一社会党将继续坚持马克思主义，在社会主义建设中既考虑本国特点，同时又注意其他社会主义国家的经验。民德将继续贯彻连续性与革新相结合的方针，寻找解决问题的适当方式，达到比资本主义更快的发展速度。他指出，应该更好地教育青年，认识西方资本主义社会“金玉其外，败絮其中”的本质。
    昂纳克强调了用新办法解决新形势下出现的问题的必要性。他说，民德完全能自己解决自己的问题。那种以取消社会主义来解决问题的主意是馊主意。他还强调，决不允许滥用赫尔辛基条约等文件来动摇社会主义，必须严格遵守尊重主权和领土完整、不干涉内政的原则。
    应邀前来参加庆祝活动的苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在大会上致词。他赞扬民德40年来在德国统一社会党领导下取得了巨大成就。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，民德和任何其他国家一样，当然也有自己的发展问题，需要深思熟虑，找到解决办法。既要考虑到社会不断继续发展的国内需要，也要从整个社会主义阵营的现代化和改革进程出发。他毫不怀疑，德国统一社会党作为社会的领导力量，能够以自己的智慧、经验和政治权威，与社会各阶层合作，找到问题的答案。
    出席庆祝大会的外国领导人还有雅鲁泽尔斯基、齐奥塞斯库、日夫科夫、雅克什、巴特蒙赫、阮文灵、什特劳乌布。
    庆祝大会以全场高唱国际歌结束。
    据新华社柏林10月7日电　（记者那福才）民主德国国家人民军今天在这里的卡尔·马克思大街举行盛大的国庆阅兵式，热烈庆祝德意志民主共和国建国40周年。姚依林应邀出席观看阅兵式。
