The foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council today issued a joint statement affirming the important role of the United Nations in contemporary international affairs. They emphasized that current regional conflicts should be resolved in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, U.S. Secretary of State Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, British Foreign Secretary Major, and French Foreign Minister Dumas today participated in a working lunch hosted by UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar. The five foreign ministers and the Secretary-General exchanged views on a wide range of major international issues and issued a joint statement after the meeting. The five foreign ministers agreed that the United Nations can play an important role at a time when the international situation is undergoing "positive changes." They praised the UN's peacekeeping operations.

The five foreign ministers welcomed and affirmed the UN's efforts to resolve regional conflicts. They advocated for a "comprehensive political solution" to the Cambodian issue to ensure Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and neutrality, and hoped that negotiations would continue for this purpose. The ministers also expressed their "firm support" for the cause of Namibian independence; hoped for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East; hoped that all parties in Afghanistan would faithfully implement the Geneva Agreement and relevant UN General Assembly resolutions; and expressed support for the current peace process in Central America.

The five foreign ministers also condemned all forms of terrorist acts in the statement and demanded the immediate release of all hostages. The statement also called for strengthened international cooperation to combat illegal drug trafficking.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with French Foreign Minister Dumas at the United Nations headquarters today. Qian pointed out that a series of unfriendly incidents against China in Paris had hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and damaged Sino-French relations.

Qian said that France was the first Western country to establish ambassador-level diplomatic relations with China. The Chinese government values Sino-French friendship and does not want Sino-French relations to be damaged. However, we do not understand why the French government has taken a tolerant attitude towards these incidents that harm Sino-French relations.

French Foreign Minister Dumas also reiterated the importance of Sino-French relations and hoped to maintain this relationship. Dumas stated that the French government does not allow Chinese people who have fled to France to engage in political activities against countries that have friendly relations with France.

Both sides also exchanged views on the Cambodian issue.
