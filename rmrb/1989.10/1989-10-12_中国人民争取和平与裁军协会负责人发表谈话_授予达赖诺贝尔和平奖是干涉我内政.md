The leader of the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament issued a statement today regarding the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to award the Dalai Lama the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. The leader expressed strong indignation over the decision.

The leader stated, "It is well known that the Dalai Lama and Tibetan separatists have undermined national unity and sought to split the country. They should be severely condemned. It is astonishing that the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which is supposed to award the prize to those who contribute to 'peace among nations,' has instead given it to someone like the Dalai Lama. This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and has deeply hurt the feelings of the Chinese people. Such actions also seriously harm the cause of world peace and are unacceptable to all peace-loving people."

    中国人民争取和平与裁军协会负责人发表谈话
    授予达赖诺贝尔和平奖是干涉我内政
    新华社北京10月11日电  中国人民争取和平与裁军协会负责人今天在这里就诺贝尔和平奖委员会授予达赖1989年度诺贝尔和平奖发表谈话，对此表示极大愤慨。
    他说，众所周知，达赖和西藏分裂主义分子破坏民族团结，分裂祖国，本应受到严厉谴责。令人惊讶的是挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会竟违背其关于为“民族间的和睦亲善”作出努力和贡献的颁奖宗旨，竟把今年的和平奖授予达赖这样一个人。这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，极大地伤害了中国人民的感情。这样做也严重损害了世界和平事业，是一切爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的。
