Today marks the opening of an exhibition on the life and work of Li Dazhao, a pioneer of the Chinese Communist movement and a great Marxist, at Peking University. The exhibition commemorates the 100th anniversary of Li Dazhao's birth on October 29.

In the exhibition hall of Peking University Library, over 300 items, including photographs and documents, vividly and comprehensively display Li Dazhao's revolutionary activities, such as his pioneering role in spreading Marxism in China and his contribution to the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Among the exhibits are original copies of journals edited by Li Dazhao, such as "New Youth," "Weekly Review," and "Young China," as well as revolutionary relics from his tenure as the director of Peking University Library, including a conference table, a wall clock, and a porcelain pen holder.

Wang Xueqian, President of the Chinese Li Dazhao Research Society and Secretary of the Peking University Party Committee, said at the opening ceremony that Li Dazhao worked and taught at Peking University from November 1917 to March 1926, a total of eight and a half years. His name is closely linked with the glorious revolutionary tradition of Peking University, and he has left us a rich spiritual heritage.

Hu Qiaomu, Ping Jiesan, Han Tianshi, Wang Jiaolou, and other leaders, as well as some teachers and students from Peking University, visited the exhibition today with reverence.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 27, in the run-up to the 100th anniversary of Li Dazhao's birth, the Chinese Youth Publishing House has published a long biography of Li Dazhao. Participants in a seminar today praised it as an excellent textbook on revolutionary traditions.

Li Dazhao was one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, a great proletarian revolutionary and thinker, and a historical giant who drove the era and the nation forward.

The biography of Li Dazhao, with rich historical materials and a documentary approach, panoramically recreates the social landscape of early 20th-century China, reflects the early stages of the Chinese revolution and the birth and development of the Chinese Communist Party, and sings the praises of the pioneers of the Chinese communist movement who dedicated themselves to a lofty cause and died heroically.

Author Wang Chaozhu conducted investigations and interviews in the places where Li Dazhao lived and fought in the late 1970s, collecting and organizing a large amount of historical materials. After ten years of reading and revising, he completed this 600,000-word masterpiece.

At the seminar, Hu Qiaomu, a member of the Central Advisory Commission, and other participants reviewed Li Dazhao's "Prison Diary" and epitaphs written by Feng Yuxiang, Liu Bannong, and others. As he read, Hu Qiaomu's eyes welled up with tears. He said that in the past, due to his busy work, he had not studied Li Dazhao's life and works enough, and it felt like he owed a great debt.

Li Baohua, Liu Baiyu, Li Ying, and others emphasized in their speeches that revolutionary tradition education is an important part of China's socialist education cause and must not be relaxed for a moment. They hope that writers and publishing houses, like the Chinese Youth Publishing House, will produce more healthy spiritual food to educate all people, especially young people, to adhere to the socialist road and provide excellent reading materials.

Participants in the seminar also included Li Yunchang, Zhang Mingyuan, Zhu Zhongli, Li Yuanchao, and Que Daolong. The seminar was organized by the Chinese Youth Publishing House and the Literature Department of the Guangming Daily.

    胡乔木、平杰三、韩天石、汪家镠等领导同志和北大部分师生今天怀着崇敬的心情参观了展览。
    据新华社北京10月27日电　（记者邵建武）在李大钊诞辰100周年前夕，中国青年出版社推出长篇传记文学《李大钊》。今天，参加座谈会的同志称赞它是一部难得的革命传统教材。
    李大钊是中国共产党的创始人之一，伟大的无产阶级革命家和思想家，是推动时代和民族向前进的历史巨人。
    传记文学《李大钊》以丰富的史料，纪实的手法，全景式地再现了20世纪初叶中国那个动荡年代的整个社会面貌，反映了中国革命最初的历程以及中国共产党的诞生与发展，讴歌了我国共产主义运动的前驱者为了崇高的事业而鞠躬尽瘁、慷慨赴死的业绩。
    作者王朝柱曾在70年代末，沿着李大钊生活战斗过的地方考察采访，搜集整理了大量史料，披览10载，数易其稿，完成了这部洋洋60万字的巨著。
    中顾委常委胡乔木同志在座谈会上，和与会同志一起重温了李大钊的《狱中自述》、冯玉祥、刘半农等分别撰写的碑文。读着读着，乔木同志热泪双流。他说，从前因为工作繁忙，对李大钊同志的生平和著作研究不够，心里好像欠了一大笔债。
    李葆华、刘白羽、李瑛等同志在发言中一致强调，革命传统教育是我国社会主义教育事业的重要组成部分，一刻也不能放松。希望作家和出版单位，像中国青年出版社这样，多多生产健康的精神食粮，为教育全体人民、特别是青少年，坚持走社会主义道路提供优秀读物。
    参加座谈会的还有李运昌、张明远、朱仲丽、李源潮、阙道隆等。这次座谈会是由中国青年出版社和《光明日报》文艺部举办的。
