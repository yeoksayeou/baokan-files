After the Beijing authorities suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his meeting with military leaders above the rank of division commander of the Beijing martial law troops, made the following remarks:

"This disturbance was bound to happen. It was determined by both the international climate and China's own domestic situation. It was inevitable, regardless of people's will. The only question was when and how big it would be."

This statement reminds us that many events that have occurred in China, including this one that started as a student movement and escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, must be examined in the context of the international climate. We must not forget that among some political forces in foreign countries, there are still those who adhere to Dulles' strategy of hoping for a "peaceful evolution" in the second and third generations of the new China.

Many of our comrades have studied the issue of capitalist countries implementing a "peaceful evolution" strategy against socialist countries. As time has passed, especially in recent years with the new trend of dialogue replacing confrontation internationally, many of our comrades have somewhat forgotten the profound implications and real significance of "peaceful evolution." Recently, central leaders have specifically pointed out, "We must not underestimate the harm caused by the plots of hostile forces internationally, who attempt to change the nature of the Party and overthrow the socialist system through peaceful evolution."

This is both a current issue and a historical one.

The hostile forces internationally attempt to change the nature of the Communist Party and overthrow the socialist system through peaceful evolution. This is not just a temporary strategy. Therefore, we must learn from the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in China: we must look at problems from the perspective of the international climate.

China is not isolated from the world. Even without considering the past imperialist blockade, since the Party's Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have implemented the policy of reform and opening up to accelerate the realization of socialist modernization. We cannot avoid interacting with developed capitalist countries, including political and economic exchanges. Politics and economics are often intertwined and mutually infiltrating. Recently, an old comrade told me, "Some Western countries want us to adopt capitalism, and they want to protect us while we do so." Indeed, once they see an opportunity or the time is ripe, they will reveal their true intentions. Although the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot is purely an internal affair, they still impose economic sanctions and even issue condemnatory statements at the Paris Summit of the Seven Nations. To achieve their goals, they not only exert efforts but also provide financial support to those who planned the riot. The fact that people like Yan Jiaqi, Wu'erkaixi, and Wan Runnan can engage in anti-China activities in some countries fully illustrates this point.

In the past, our Party has always attached great importance to the study and discussion of the international situation. At Party meetings, we often first discuss and analyze the international situation to make everyone understand that our cause and struggle are closely related to the international struggle. This approach has great benefits, enabling us to maintain a relatively clear mind.

However, after criticizing the line of "class struggle as the key link," some people, under the guise of criticism, completely avoid discussing the issue of class struggle in our society. As for whether there is still class struggle internationally, even fewer people pay attention to it. We say that emphasizing class struggle as the key link is incorrect, but having no class analysis at all is also incorrect.

To this day, certain political forces in the world of capitalism not only want to maintain their capitalist system forever but also strive to overthrow the socialist system. This is also something that cannot be changed by people's will. Since the coexistence of capitalist and socialist systems, the struggle has never ceased, only the methods of struggle have changed. We used to say that opening up is nothing to be afraid of; when the window is opened, a few flies will inevitably come in. A few small flies are indeed nothing to be afraid of. But in essence, the harm brought by a few small flies should not be underestimated. Take the "yellow bacteria" of the bourgeoisie, for example; many of them come from the capitalist world. Today, we must use the "anti-pornography" broom to sweep them away, and it is not possible to sweep them away completely with just one "anti-pornography" campaign. Doesn't this deserve our deep reflection?

We must continue with reform and opening up. We will not and cannot return to the old path of closing the door to the world. But what is the purpose of our reform and opening up? It is to develop our socialist country. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently pointed out at the meeting of ambassadors, "We must talk about both economics and politics; we must talk about both friendship and struggle; we must talk about both principles and strategies." This is completely correct. In recent times, many comrades have forgotten to educate people about the "international climate," and with the long-term prevalence of bourgeois liberalization, some people have used the name of reform and opening up to peddle capitalist goods, and the trend of worshipping foreign things has become rampant. Thoughts like "the foreign moon is rounder than the Chinese moon" have even begun to reappear. Some people have completely lost the consciousness of struggle. They should know that replacing confrontation with dialogue is only a change in the method of struggle, not a change in the essence of the struggle.

Recently, Comrade Qian Xuesen, after receiving the Small Rockwell Award, made a remark worth our consideration. He said, "Today, the award given to me is said to be the first time a Chinese person has received this award. I say, the key point is the three characters 'Chinese person.' This 'Chinese person' actually should include tens of thousands of people who have made contributions to this." Comrade Qian Xuesen is a man of learning and, under the control of imperialism, he resolutely returned to China and became the father of China's missile technology. I think it is precisely because he recognized that Chinese socialism has a bright future that he resolutely returned to his motherland to serve the cause of China's space science. He can be called a model for Chinese students studying abroad.

Today, we must seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks about the international climate to think about our own future. This is very important for each of us.

We will not close the door that has already been opened through reform and opening up. We will continue to interact with various countries, engage in exchanges with developed capitalist countries, conduct trade, economic and technological cooperation, cultural exchanges, and send students abroad. All of these will not only continue but also be strengthened. At the same time, we must deeply understand the current international climate from this turmoil and riot.

In the current détente, exchanges between countries with different systems have increased, and socialist countries have more channels to introduce funds and technology from the West. Some people in the West believe that there are more channels and means to infiltrate and influence socialism. Indeed, in recent years, Western countries have made significant developments in economics and technology, while socialist countries have encountered some difficulties in their development, and there have been mistakes in decision-making, and the superiority of the socialist system has not been fully demonstrated. Thus, internationally, there has emerged a trend that socialism is failing and capitalism is regaining vitality. For socialist countries to take the road of reform, the West sees this as a "historical retreat of socialism," even the "failure of communism," providing them with a historical opportunity to promote "peaceful evolution." This is particularly evident in their use of slogans like "human rights," "multi-party system," and "privatization" to vigorously encourage the development of bourgeois liberalization tendencies in socialist countries, support "dissidents," and spare no effort to infiltrate and interfere. This is the comprehensive international climate today and is the external cause of the student movement, turmoil, and counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in our country.

Therefore, studying the "international climate" is indeed a major issue related to the fate of our republic. Everything in the world is afraid of not knowing and not being sober-minded. As long as we are sober-minded and know, there is nothing to be afraid of. We are a great power in the world. Our people are diligent and brave. We have repeatedly foiled the encirclement and attacks of imperialism. We have successfully established a socialist republic that has stood for 40 years. Our friends are all over the world. We must emphasize strengthening relations with various countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are not intimidated by certain pressures. The purpose of our discussion on the international climate is to make the whole country aware of this and thus adjust our country's "small climate." We will not neglect our "small climate." The series of decisions and measures by the Party Central Committee and the State Council are precisely aimed at adjusting the "small climate."

The capitalist forces in the world want to overthrow socialism, which shows that they are afraid of socialism. We firmly believe that as long as our people have a clear understanding of the international "climate" and can proceed step by step according to the decisions and measures of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the future of our republic is full of hope, and the socialist system is full of hope.

    谈谈国际大气候
    陈沂
    北京平息反革命暴乱后，小平同志在接见北京戒严部队军以上干部时讲了一段话：
    “这场风波迟早要来，这是国际大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的，是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的，只不过是迟早的问题，大小的问题。”
    这段讲话告诫我们：中国所发生的许多事情，其中包括像这次的由学潮到动乱到北京发生的反革命暴乱，都要联系国际大气候来加以考察，都不要忘记在外国的一些政治势力中，仍然有些人奉行杜勒斯的把希望寄托在新中国的第二代、第三代的“和平演变”上。
    我们许多同志曾经研究过有关资本主义国家对社会主义国家推行“和平演变”策略的问题。随着时间的推移，特别是近年来国际上出现了对话代替对抗的新趋势以来，我们不少同志在观念上对“和平演变”所包含的深刻内涵和现实意义有所淡忘了。最近，中央领导同志特别指出，“我们决不能低估国际上的敌对势力通过和平演变手段，妄图改变党的性质，颠覆社会主义制度阴谋所造成的危害。”
    这是一个现实问题，也是一个历史问题。
    国际上的敌对势力妄图通过和平演变手段改变共产党的性质，颠覆社会主义制度，这绝不仅仅是一时的策略。因此，我们必须从我国最近所发生的动乱和反革命暴乱中吸取教训：要从国际大气候来看问题。
    中国并非孤悬世界以外。且不谈过去帝国主义的封锁，即从我党十一届三中全会后执行改革开放政策以来，为了加速实现社会主义现代化，我们不能排除同那些发达的资本主义国家交往，其中包括在政治、经济方面打交道。而政治和经济又是难以截然分开，往往是互相渗透的。不久前，一位老同志曾对我说过：“西方一些国家就是想要我们搞资本主义，而且是在他们保护下搞资本主义。”确实，它们一旦认为有机可乘或时机成熟，就会露出其真面目。尽管这次平息反革命暴乱完全是我国内政，他们就是要进行什么经济制裁，甚至在巴黎七国首脑会议上发表谴责声明。为达到他们的目的，他们不但出力，而且出钱资助那些策划暴乱的人。严家其、吾尔开希、万润南等之所以能在有的国家进行反对我国的活动就充分说明这一点。
    过去，我党一向重视对国际形势的研究和议论，在党的会议上，往往首先议论、分析国际形势，使大家了解我们的事业和斗争是同国际上的斗争密切相关的。这样做大有好处，使我们能经常保持比较清醒的头脑。
    但是，从批判“阶级斗争为纲”之后，有些人就在批判的名义下根本不讲在我们的社会里还有阶级斗争问题。至于在国际上是否还有阶级斗争，就更是很少有人过问了。我们说，讲阶级斗争为纲不对，但一点阶级分析的观点都没有，也不对。
    至今，世界资本主义某些政治势力不但要维护其资本主义制度使之永存，同时力图颠覆社会主义制度，这也是不以人们的意志为转移的。自从资本主义和社会主义两种制度并存以来，斗争从来没有停息过，只不过是斗争的方式有所不同而已。我们过去常说，开放没有什么可怕，窗户打开了，总会飞进来几个苍蝇。小小几个苍蝇当然没有什么可怕的。但从本质来看，小小几个苍蝇带来的毒害却不可低估。就拿资产阶级的“黄色细菌”说吧，有许多就是从资本主义世界吹进来的，今天我们就不能不用“扫黄”这把大扫帚来加以扫除，而且并非一次“扫黄”就能扫除净尽的，这难道不值得我们深思？！
    我们还要继续进行改革开放，我们决不能也决不会回到闭关锁国的老路上去。但我们改革开放的目的是什么，是发展我们的社会主义国家。江泽民同志最近在驻外使节会议上指出：“既要讲经济，又要讲政治；既要讲友好，又要讲斗争；既要讲原则，又要讲策略。”这是完全正确的。前些时，不少同志就忘了对人们进行“国际大气候”的教育，加之资产阶级自由化长期泛滥，有些人借改革开放之名，贩卖资本主义的货色，崇洋媚外的风气一时甚嚣尘上，“外国的月亮比中国的圆”一类思想竟然又开始出现。有的人完全丧失了斗争观念，要知道，以对话代替对抗，只是斗争方式的转变，而决不是斗争本质的转移。
    最近钱学森同志获得小罗克维尔奖后讲的一段话很值得我们思考。他说：“今天给我的奖，说是第一名中国人得此奖。我说，要紧的是‘中国人’三个字，这个‘中国人’实际应该包括成千上万为此作出贡献的人。”钱学森同志学有专长，而且是在他受制于帝国主义的情况下毅然回到中国，而成为中国导弹之父的。我想，正因为他认识到中国社会主义有远大前途，才毅然回到祖国，为祖国的空间科学事业服务。他可以称得起是中国留学生的一代楷模。
    我们今天一定要认真学习小平同志关于国际大气候的论断，以思考自己的未来。这对我们每个人来说，都是十分重要的。
    我们不会排外，把已经改革开放的大门关闭起来。我们还要同各国继续进行交往，同发达的资本主义国家交往，还要同他们进行贸易，进行经济和科技合作，文化交流，互派留学生等等。所有这些，不仅不变，而且还要加强。同时，我们又必须从这次动乱和暴乱中，深刻认识当前的国际大气候。
    在当前的缓和形势下，不同制度国家交往增多，社会主义国家更多地从西方引进资金和技术，对此，西方某些人认为对社会主义进行渗透、施加影响的渠道和手段更多了。诚然，近些年来西方国家在经济、科技方面有较大发展，而社会主义国家在发展过程中遇到了一些困难，决策也有失误，社会主义制度的优越性未能充分发挥出来。于是，国际上出现了一股所谓社会主义走向失败，资本主义再现活力的思潮。对社会主义国家走上改革的道路，西方认为这意味着“社会主义的历史性退却”，甚至“共产主义的失败”，为他们推行“和平演变”提供了历史的时机。这特别表现在他们以“人权”、“多党制”和“私有化”为口号，起劲地鼓励在社会主义国家发展资产阶级自由化倾向，支持“不同政见者”，不遗余力地进行渗透和干扰。这就是目前国际大气候的综合，也是我国这次发生由学潮、动乱到反革命暴乱的外因。
    正因为如此，研究“国际大气候”实在是有关我们共和国前途命运的重大问题。世间一切事情就怕不知道，不清醒，只要清醒、知道了，就没什么可怕的。我们是世界上一个大国，我们的人民勤劳勇敢，我们曾经一次次粉碎过帝国主义的包围和进攻，我们成功地建立的社会主义共和国已经屹立于世界40周年。我们的朋友遍天下。我们还要强调在和平共处五项原则的基础上加强同各国的关系。我们并不为某些压力所吓倒。我们议论国际大气候的目的，是要举国上下对此有个清醒的认识，从而调整好我们国家的“小气候”。我们决不忽视我们的“小气候”。现在党中央、国务院一系列的决策和措施，正是围绕调整“小气候”而提出的。
    世界资本主义势力要颠覆社会主义，说明他们害怕社会主义。我们深信，我们广大人民一旦对国际“大气候”有了清醒的认识，又能按照党中央、国务院的决策和措施一步一个脚印地向前走，我们共和国的前途大有希望，社会主义制度大有希望。
