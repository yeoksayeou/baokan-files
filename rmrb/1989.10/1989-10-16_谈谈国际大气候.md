Title: On the International Climate

After the Beijing authorities suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his meeting with military leaders above the rank of division commander of the Beijing martial law troops, made the following remarks:

"This disturbance was bound to happen. It was determined by both the international climate and China's own domestic situation. It was inevitable, regardless of people's will. The only question was when and how big it would be."

This statement reminds us that many events that have occurred in China, including this one that started as a student movement and escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, must be examined in the context of the international climate. We must not forget that among some political forces in foreign countries, there are still those who adhere to Dulles' strategy of hoping for a "peaceful evolution" in the second and third generations of the new China.

Many of our comrades have studied the issue of capitalist countries implementing a "peaceful evolution" strategy against socialist countries. As time has passed, especially in recent years with the new trend of dialogue replacing confrontation internationally, many of our comrades have somewhat forgotten the profound implications and real significance of "peaceful evolution." Recently, central leaders have specifically pointed out, "We must not underestimate the harm caused by the plots of hostile forces internationally, who attempt to change the nature of the Party and overthrow the socialist system through peaceful evolution."

This is both a current issue and a historical one.

The hostile forces internationally attempt to change the nature of the Communist Party and overthrow the socialist system through peaceful evolution. This is not just a temporary strategy. Therefore, we must learn from the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in China: we must look at problems from the perspective of the international climate.

China is not isolated from the world. Even without considering the past imperialist blockade, since the Party's Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have implemented the policy of reform and opening up to accelerate the realization of socialist modernization. We cannot avoid interacting with developed capitalist countries, including political and economic exchanges. Politics and economics are often intertwined and mutually infiltrating. Recently, an old comrade told me, "Some Western countries want us to adopt capitalism, and they want to protect us while we do so." Indeed, once they see an opportunity or the time is ripe, they will reveal their true intentions. Although the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot is purely an internal affair, they still impose economic sanctions and even issue condemnatory statements at the Paris Summit of the Seven Nations. To achieve their goals, they not only exert efforts but also provide financial support to those who planned the riot. The fact that people like Yan Jiaqi, Wu'erkaixi, and Wan Runnan can engage in anti-China activities in some countries fully illustrates this point.

In the past, our Party has always attached great importance to the study and discussion of the international situation. At Party meetings, we often first discuss and analyze the international situation to make everyone understand that our cause and struggle are closely related to the international struggle. This approach has great benefits, enabling us to maintain a relatively clear mind.

However, after criticizing the line of "class struggle as the key link," some people, under the guise of criticism, completely avoid discussing the issue of class struggle in our society. As for whether there is still class struggle internationally, even fewer people pay attention to it. We say that emphasizing class struggle as the key link is incorrect, but having no class analysis at all is also incorrect.

To this day, certain political forces in the world of capitalism not only want to maintain their capitalist system forever but also strive to overthrow the socialist system. This is also something that cannot be changed by people's will. Since the coexistence of capitalist and socialist systems, the struggle has never ceased, only the methods of struggle have changed. We used to say that opening up is nothing to be afraid of; when the window is opened, a few flies will inevitably come in. A few small flies are indeed nothing to be afraid of. But in essence, the harm brought by a few small flies should not be underestimated. Take the "yellow bacteria" of the bourgeoisie, for example; many of them come from the capitalist world. Today, we must use the "anti-pornography" broom to sweep them away, and it is not possible to sweep them away completely with just one "anti-pornography" campaign. Doesn't this deserve our deep reflection?

We must continue with reform and opening up. We will not and cannot return to the old path of closing the door to the world. But what is the purpose of our reform and opening up? It is to develop our socialist country. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently pointed out at the meeting of ambassadors, "We must talk about both economics and politics; we must talk about both friendship and struggle; we must talk about both principles and strategies." This is completely correct. In recent times, many comrades have forgotten to educate people about the "international climate," and with the long-term prevalence of bourgeois liberalization, some people have used the name of reform and opening up to peddle capitalist goods, and the trend of worshipping foreign things has become rampant. Thoughts like "the foreign moon is rounder than the Chinese moon" have even begun to reappear. Some people have completely lost the consciousness of struggle. They should know that replacing confrontation with dialogue is only a change in the method of struggle, not a change in the essence of the struggle.

Recently, Comrade Qian Xuesen, after receiving the Small Rockwell Award, made a remark worth our consideration. He said, "Today, the award given to me is said to be the first time a Chinese person has received this award. I say, the key point is the three characters 'Chinese person.' This 'Chinese person' actually should include tens of thousands of people who have made contributions to this." Comrade Qian Xuesen is a man of learning and, under the control of imperialism, he resolutely returned to China and became the father of China's missile technology. I think it is precisely because he recognized that Chinese socialism has a bright future that he resolutely returned to his motherland to serve the cause of China's space science. He can be called a model for Chinese students studying abroad.

Today, we must seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks about the international climate to think about our own future. This is very important for each of us.

We will not close the door that has already been opened through reform and opening up. We will continue to interact with various countries, engage in exchanges with developed capitalist countries, conduct trade, economic and technological cooperation, cultural exchanges, and send students abroad. All of these will not only continue but also be strengthened. At the same time, we must deeply understand the current international climate from this turmoil and riot.

In the current d√©tente, exchanges between countries with different systems have increased, and socialist countries have more channels to introduce funds and technology from the West. Some people in the West believe that there are more channels and means to infiltrate and influence socialism. Indeed, in recent years, Western countries have made significant developments in economics and technology, while socialist countries have encountered some difficulties in their development, and there have been mistakes in decision-making, and the superiority of the socialist system has not been fully demonstrated. Thus, internationally, there has emerged a trend that socialism is failing and capitalism is regaining vitality. For socialist countries to take the road of reform, the West sees this as a "historical retreat of socialism," even the "failure of communism," providing them with a historical opportunity to promote "peaceful evolution." This is particularly evident in their use of slogans like "human rights," "multi-party system," and "privatization" to vigorously encourage the development of bourgeois liberalization tendencies in socialist countries, support "dissidents," and spare no effort to infiltrate and interfere. This is the comprehensive international climate today and is the external cause of the student movement, turmoil, and counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in our country.

Therefore, studying the "international climate" is indeed a major issue related to the fate of our republic. Everything in the world is afraid of not knowing and not being sober-minded. As long as we are sober-minded and know, there is nothing to be afraid of. We are a great power in the world. Our people are diligent and brave. We have repeatedly foiled the encirclement and attacks of imperialism. We have successfully established a socialist republic that has stood for 40 years. Our friends are all over the world. We must emphasize strengthening relations with various countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are not intimidated by certain pressures. The purpose of our discussion on the international climate is to make the whole country aware of this and thus adjust our country's "small climate." We will not neglect our "small climate." The series of decisions and measures by the Party Central Committee and the State Council are precisely aimed at adjusting the "small climate."

The capitalist forces in the world want to overthrow socialism, which shows that they are afraid of socialism. We firmly believe that as long as our people have a clear understanding of the international "climate" and can proceed step by step according to the decisions and measures of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the future of our republic is full of hope, and the socialist system is full of hope.
