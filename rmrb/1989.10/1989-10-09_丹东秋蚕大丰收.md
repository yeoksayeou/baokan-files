	The Xinhua News Agency reported from Shenyang on October 8 that the entire city of DanDong in Liaoning Province raised 43,000 batches of autumn silkworms. The farmers strengthened management, selected high-quality breeds, prevented and controlled pests, and implemented a technical contract responsibility system for every 10,000 batches of autumn silkworms.
