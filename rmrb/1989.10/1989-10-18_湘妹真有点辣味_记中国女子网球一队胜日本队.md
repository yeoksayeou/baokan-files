The Japanese women's tennis team tasted the "spicy" style of the Hunan girls on the second day of the East Asia Women's Tennis Team Championships, losing to three Hunan girls and thus missing out on the chance to advance to the finals.

The Chinese women's team consists of Chen Li, Tang Min, and Li Fang, all averaging 18 years of age. The girls have a fighting spirit but lack experience. The Japanese team, composed of Nishitani Akemi, Handa Eiko, and Takagi Keiko, has the advantage of better technique and more experience. The first match for China was Tang Min against Handa Eiko. Initially, the scores were closely matched, resulting in a prolonged battle. Later, Tang Min increased her speed and attacked relentlessly, forcing her opponent into repeated mistakes. Ultimately, Tang Min won with a score of 2:0.

The second match for China was Chen Li. Chen Li was not in good physical condition, and the coach's plan was for her to participate only in singles, with the other two players handling doubles. Nishitani Akemi seemed to sense Chen Li's poor physical condition and launched a series of fast attacks, frequently scoring points. Chen Li lost the first set to Nishitani Akemi. In the second set, Chen Li switched to a defensive strategy, wearing down her opponent's stamina. By the fourth game, Nishitani Akemi, due to overexertion, began to experience cramps. Chen Li seized this opportunity, hitting the ball to all corners of the court, forcing her opponent to run back and forth. Nishitani Akemi couldn't hold out any longer and lost the second set 4:6.

In the crucial third set, Chen Li did not yield an inch, seizing every opportunity to attack and winning with a score of 6:3. Thus, Chen Li won the decisive match with a score of 2:1.

With this victory, the Chinese team secured the win.

    湘妹真有点辣味
    ——记中国女子网球一队胜日本队
    日本女子网球队在东亚网球团体赛第二天尝到了中国湘妹的辣味，被3名湖南姑娘击败，从而失去了进入决赛的机会。
    中国女子一队是由平均年龄18岁的陈莉、唐敏、李芳组成，姑娘们虽有一股拚劲，但缺乏经验。日本队由西谷明美、饭田荣和高木圭郁组成，其长处是技术好，经验丰富。中国队第一个出场的是唐敏，由她迎战饭田荣。一开始两人比分咬得很紧，打了一阵“持久战”。之后，唐敏加快速度进攻，连续打底线球，使对手不断失误，最后以2∶0取得胜利。
    中国队第二个出场的是陈莉。陈莉身体欠佳，教练的意图是，只让其参加单打，由另两名选手担任双打。西谷明美好像看出了陈莉身体状况欠佳，一个劲地快速进攻，并频频得手。第一盘陈莉输给了西谷明美。第二盘，陈莉在防守中反攻，消耗对手体力。打到第4局时，西谷明美由于用力过多，出现抽筋现象。陈莉抓住这个机会，将球击到对方的前后左右，调动其来回奔跑。西谷明美顶不住了，第二盘以4∶6败阵。
    关键的第三盘决战，陈莉寸步不让，抓住机会进攻，以6∶3获胜。这样陈莉以2∶1拿下这关键性的一场。
    球打到这里，中国队也就胜了。
