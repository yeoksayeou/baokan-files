U.S. President Bush met with visiting Italian President Francesco Cossiga at the White House on the 11th to discuss East-West relations. According to a U.S. official, the two presidents emphasized during their talks that Western unity is necessary at a time when tensions are easing but peace and freedom are still under threat. The official said that the two presidents did not reach an agreement on the upcoming Adriatic region conference, which will be attended by Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. Cossiga told Bush that Italy has historical interests in the Adriatic region. He said that improving relations with the countries in this region does not contradict NATO's policy or Western policy.

    意总统访美讨论东西方关系
    美国总统布什十一日在白宫同来访的意大利总统弗朗切斯科·科西加举行会谈，着重讨论了东西方关系问题。据一位美国官员说，两位总统在会谈中强调，在紧张局势趋向缓和但和平与自由仍受到威胁的时候，西方需要团结。这位官员说，两位总统在即将举行的、由意大利、奥地利、匈牙利和南斯拉夫四国参加的亚德里亚地区会议问题上未达成一致。科西加对布什说，意大利在亚德里亚地区有着历史的利益。他说，意大利改善同这个地区国家的关系并不违背北约的政策或西方的政策。
