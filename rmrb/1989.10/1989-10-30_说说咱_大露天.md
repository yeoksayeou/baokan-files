Title: Talking About Our "Open-Pit Mine"

This day, I was off duty, and it happened to be the day before the 40th anniversary celebration. I was in a good mood, had a few more glasses of spicy wine, and went for a walk. I ended up at the edge of the big open-pit mine.

Looking at this man-made coal valley, my heart swelled with pride. The day before, I read in the newspaper that our Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine had contributed 150 million tons of coal to the country and removed 750 million cubic meters of soil. Thinking about this, I felt like singing a few lines, so I hummed, "From the grasslands to Tiananmen Square..."

I don't have many hobbies; I just like performing and singing. Since playing the role of "Little Son-in-Law," I've been performing for at least 30 years. I've worked in this open-pit mine for over 30 years and sung for over 30 years...

I am 56 years old. Our mine started production in 1953. At that time, it was the largest mechanized open-pit mine in the country. I, as one of the first generation of miners in New China, was sent to the workers' school to learn about electric drills in 1954. After returning, I became an electric drill operator. Back then, people compared tractors to iron oxen. By that analogy, our big electric drills were "iron lions," and the operators were the handlers of these "iron lions." Whenever I got on the electric drill, I was eager to see the production board's small red flag for overproduction. If the output really "launched a satellite," great! I would walk down the corridor, humming with joy. One year, our team won first place, and I was rewarded with a large white enamel basin with a few small red characters written on it. I brought it home and showed it off to my wife, then displayed it like an antique in a prominent place at home, fearing that visitors might not see it and bury the honor.

It's funny to think about it, but back then, even a big, strong young man would look forward to "May 1st" and "October 1st" like a child waiting for the New Year. During these two holidays, miners would put on new uniforms, tie a white lambskin handkerchief around their necks, carry large red plaques with "Celebration" and "Overproduction" written on them, and follow the band in parades to participate in city gatherings. At times like these, I, as an amateur singer, would naturally stand out. Not only would I walk at the head of the procession with my chest out and head held high, but I would also occasionally start a song. I remember in 1965, during the "October 1st" celebration, my song "We Walk on the Great Road" was "ruined." I started with "We Walk on the Great Road," and then, in a moment of excitement, I sang "The Waves of Honghu Lake." Imagine, with the deep voices of the miners singing this slow song, what a scene it must have been. It was hilarious.

On the eve of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the nation, Zhu De, Dong Biwu, and other central leaders came to inspect our open-pit mine. That day, I was on duty. I always felt that the leaders were standing on the open-pit dispatch platform, watching me operate the drill. I worked extra hard, determined to show the leaders the spirit of our miners. That day, Zhu De and Dong Biwu wrote words of encouragement for our mine, urging us to work hard and strive for the construction of a socialist New China. This made all of us miners overjoyed.

During the "Cultural Revolution," blindly high targets caused our mine to become imbalanced in coal mining and stripping. In other words, we were only eating the meat without gnawing on the bones, adding obstacles to future production and development. During those years, we often sang the part "Expressing Ambition and Establishing Resolve" from "Hunting Tigers on the Mountain." However, the open-pit mine was still stuck in the same place.

The wind of reform blew, and the open-pit mine, which had lost its footing, began to run again. The mine proposed technological transformation and modern management, and called on everyone to carry forward the enterprise spirit and form a collective cohesion. When we miners hear this, we should have a "spirit of the open-pit mine"—be a "person of the open-pit mine," and treat the "open-pit mine" as a great cause. Our "open-pit mine" began to perform on the stage of reform. The mine took this seriously, and from 1983 onwards, our mine won the championship in the national mine competition for five consecutive years. Last year, we produced over 610 million tons of coal, the highest in the history of the mine, doubling the designed capacity. Economic benefits were also at the forefront of the nation, with profits reaching over 81 million yuan last year, while the best year during the "Cultural Revolution" was less than 30 million yuan. Our mine is also an excellent enterprise for ideological and political work among workers nationwide... With the mine's good performance, the miners have become wealthy. My family of five has a monthly income of over 530 yuan. Life is prosperous and comfortable, so I often sing "Our Life is Full of Sunshine." The children laugh at me for singing poorly, but I don't mind. I sing my feelings; if my heart is happy, I must sing.

You see, once I start talking about the "open-pit mine," my emotions rise. I always feel that dedicating my life to the "open-pit mine"—it's worth it!

### 说说咱“大露天”

　　说说咱“大露天”
　　阜新矿务局海州露天煤矿　高子轩
    这天我休班儿，又赶上迎40大庆的日子，心里头高兴，多喝了两盅辣烧儿，出来一遛，就到了大露天矿坑边上。
    望着这个人工挖成的大煤谷，我心里一个劲儿地涨潮。头天看报纸，说咱这阜新海州露天煤矿已经为国家献出1.5亿吨煤炭，剥离了7.5亿多立方米土方。想到这儿，我这好唱两嗓子的瘾头拱上来了，随口就哼起“从草原来到天安门广场……”。
    我没啥嗜好，就喜欢演个戏唱个歌什么的。打从演“小女婿”至今，少说也有30年业余演出史了。咳，我在这大露天干了30多年，也唱了30多年……
    我今年56岁。咱这矿1953年投产，那会儿是国内最大的机械化露天矿。我作为新中国的头茬矿工，1954年被送进工人干校电镐班学习，回来后当上了电镐司机。那阵儿，人们把拖拉机比成铁牛。按这么比，咱们的大电镐就是“铁狮子”，司机就是使唤这“铁狮子”的驭手。那时，我只要一上电镐，就心急火燎地惦着生产牌上超产的小红旗。要是产量真的放了“卫星”，妥！咱连走道都乐得一颠一颠的。有一年，我们镐夺了第一，奖我个大白搪瓷缸子，上头写了几个小红字。我捧回家不单跟媳妇炫耀了一番，还像供古董似地摆在家中显眼的地方，生怕来串门的瞅不着，把荣誉给埋没了。
    说来好笑，那年头挺大个小伙子竟像孩子盼年似地盼“五一”、“十一”。一到这俩节，矿工就换上崭新的工装，白羊肚手巾往脖上一扎，抬着“庆祝”、“超产”字样的大红牌匾，跟在鼓乐队后面，唱着歌儿去参加市里的集会游行。每当这时，我这业余歌手当然最露脸。不但挺胸抬头走在队伍头里，还不时地起个歌子什么的。记得1965年“十一”那回我的歌子起“砸”了。我先起了一个“我们走在大路上”，接着脑袋一热起了首“洪湖水浪打浪”。您想想，粗音大嗓的矿工们唱这慢悠悠的歌，该是什么情景。真是笑死人了。
    建国15周年前夕，朱德、董必武等中央首长来咱大露天视察。那天我正当班。我老觉得首长正站在露天调度平台上，看我在镐上作业。我加倍地干活，一门心思让首长看看咱矿工的精气神儿。那天，朱德、董必武为我们矿题了词，鼓励咱艰苦奋斗，为建设社会主义新中国鼓足干劲，把咱矿工们一个个高兴坏了。
    赶到“文革”，盲目的高指标使我们矿采煤与剥离失调。说白了，就是光吃肉不啃骨头，给以后的生产发展增添了拦路虎。那几年没少唱“打虎上山”那段“抒豪情立壮志”。可是，大露天还是一个劲儿地在原地打转转。
    改革的春风一吹，大露天这头失蹄的骏马才又飞跑起来。矿里提出搞技术改造和现代化管理，还号召大伙儿发扬企业精神，形成群体凝聚力。叫咱矿工品品这话，就是得有个“大露天精神”——做个“大露天人”，把“大露天”当个大事业来干。咱这“大露天”在改革大舞台上就唱开了“戏”。矿上这么一抓，从1983年起，我们矿连续5年在全国矿际竞赛得优胜。去年产煤610多万吨，是建矿以来最高的一年，比设计能力翻了一番。经济效益也是全国先进，去年利润达到8100多万元，而“文革”期间最好的年份还不到3000万元。我们矿还是全国职工思想政治工作优秀企业……矿上效益好，矿工也富了。我家5口人，月薪加一起开过530元。日子过得红火滋润，我就老唱“我们的生活充满阳光”。孩子们笑我唱得欠水平，我满不在乎。我唱的是心情，心里乐，就得唱。
    您瞧，我一唠上“大露天”感情就上来了。我总觉得，这辈子把自个儿交给“大露天”——值！
