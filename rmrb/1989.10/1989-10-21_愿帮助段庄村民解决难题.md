Your newspaper published on August 1, 6th edition, the letter to the editor titled "Wheat Field Diseases Spread Year After Year, Seguang Farmers Seek Help with Tears" has prompted us to decide to help Seguang village residents solve this problem. Therefore, we request that they collect soil samples from the areas most severely affected by wheat diseases and from unaffected areas, each 20 centimeters deep and weighing 1 kilogram. Please seal these samples in plastic bags and send them to us. After we analyze the soil samples, we will make further arrangements.
