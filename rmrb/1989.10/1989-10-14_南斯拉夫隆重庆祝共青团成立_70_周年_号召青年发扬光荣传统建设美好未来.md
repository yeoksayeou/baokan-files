	Yugoslavia has been holding various activities to solemnly celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth League.

	On October 10, the Socialist Youth League of Yugoslavia held a celebration in Zagreb, the birthplace of the Communist Youth League. The Chairman of the Socialist Youth League, B. Azevski, reviewed the fighting history of the revolutionary youth movement in Yugoslavia and its significant contributions to the revolutionary cause and socialist construction in Yugoslavia. He called on the youth of Yugoslavia to inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the Communist Youth League and to strive unremittingly for a better future.

	On the same day, the Socialist Youth League of Yugoslavia awarded the "7 Communist Youth League Secretaries Award" to young people who have made outstanding contributions in the fields of scientific research, literature, art, and sports. The Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist League of Yugoslavia, S. Korosec, pointed out in his speech that the heroism, patriotism, and revolutionary activities of the Communist Youth League members have been recorded in the history of the peoples of Yugoslavia and have become examples for the new generation to fight new battles and achieve new victories.

	The Communist Youth League of Yugoslavia was founded on October 10, 1919, in Zagreb. In the heroic struggle against the old Yugoslav dictatorship, 7 Communist Youth League secretaries were brutally killed by the reactionaries. As a reliable assistant of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, the Communist Youth League led the broad masses of young people to actively participate in the people's liberation struggle of Yugoslavia, and more than 100,000 Communist Youth League members sacrificed their young lives for the cause of liberating the people of Yugoslavia. In the post-war reconstruction and construction, millions of young people participated in the voluntary labor to build the motherland. In 1948, the Communist Youth League was renamed the People's Youth League of Yugoslavia, and in 1974, it was renamed the Socialist Youth League of Yugoslavia.

    南斯拉夫隆重庆祝共青团成立70周年
    号召青年发扬光荣传统建设美好未来
    据新华社贝尔格莱德10月11日电　（记者徐坤明）连日来，南斯拉夫举行各种活动，隆重庆祝南共青团成立70周年。
    10月10日，南斯拉夫社会主义青年联盟在南共青团的诞生地萨格勒布举行庆祝会。社青盟主席布·阿泽斯基在大会上回顾了南革命青年运动的战斗历程及其对南革命和社会主义建设事业的重大贡献。他号召南斯拉夫青年继承和发扬南共青团的光荣传统，为建设更美好的未来而进行不懈的努力。
    同一天晚上，南社青盟向在科学研究、文学艺术和体育等领域作出了杰出贡献的青年颁发了“7名南共青团书记奖”。南共联盟中央主席团书记什·科罗舍茨在讲话中指出，南共青团团员的英雄主义、爱国热情和革命活动已载入南各族人民的史册，并已成为新一代青年进行新的战斗和争取新的胜利的榜样。
    南斯拉夫共青团是1919年10月10日在萨格勒布宣告成立的。在反对旧南斯拉夫独裁政权的英勇斗争中，有7名南共青团书记惨死在反动派的屠刀下。作为南斯拉夫共产党的得力助手，南共青团带领广大青年积极参加了南人民解放斗争，并有10多万共青团员为南人民的解放事业献出了年轻的生命。在战后的恢复和建设中，有数百万青年参加了建设祖国的义务劳动。1948年南共青团改名为南人民青年联盟，1974年又改名为南斯拉夫社会主义青年联盟。
