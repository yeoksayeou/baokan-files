Madagascar's President Didier Ratziraka said to our ambassador that Madagascar supports the Chinese government's decisive measures to quell the counter-revolutionary riots and opposes some countries' interference in China's internal affairs. This was stated by Ratziraka on the evening of October 2 when he met with Chinese Ambassador to Madagascar Wei Dong and the Chairman of China Huadian Corporation, General Manager of Huadian Power Company Pan Yansheng at the presidential palace.

He said, no government in the world could tolerate a small group of rioters causing turmoil in its capital for two months with the intention of overthrowing the government. Some Western powers have interfered in China's internal affairs and imposed economic sanctions in the process, which is an irrational act. He stressed that China's affairs should be handled by the Chinese government and should not be interfered with by other countries.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait, October 1, The Kuwait Times today published an article criticizing Western countries' economic sanctions against China and urging them to reconsider their policies towards China.

The article said that Western countries are unwilling to impose economic sanctions on South Africa's apartheid regime, but their actions against China will not bring them any credibility.

The article also said that any attempt to deny China's contributions to the cause of justice and freedom in the world is doomed to fail. The article said that Western media's reports on the events that took place in China in early June were exaggerated and irresponsible, with more speculation than facts.

On October 2, the Chinese delegation led by Ma Yibo, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, arrived in Berlin. They were warmly welcomed by Klaus Kleber, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic. The delegation will participate in the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

    拉齐拉卡总统对我大使说
    马达加斯加支持中国平暴
    科威特报纸批评西方制裁中国
    据新华社塔那那利佛10月3日电　（记者武海云、应鸿）我们支持中国政府采取果断措施平息反革命暴乱，反对一些国家干涉中国的内政。这是马达加斯加总统迪迪埃·拉齐拉卡2日晚在总统府接见中国驻马大使韦东和中国华能集团董事、华能发电公司总经理潘燕生时讲这番话的。
    他说，世界上没有哪国政府能够容忍一小撮暴徒在其首都制造旨在推翻政府的动乱达两个月之久。一些西方大国在这一过程中粗暴地干涉中国内政，并进行经济制裁，这是丧失理智的表现。他强调，中国的事应由中国政府去解决，不容别国干涉。
    新华社科威特10月1日电《科威特时报》今天载文批评西方国家对中国实行经济制裁并敦促它们重新审查对中国的政策。
    文章说，西方国家不愿对南非种族主义实行经济制裁，而对中国采取这种作法绝不会给其自身带来任何信誉。
    文章还说，任何企图否定中国对整个世界的正义和自由事业的贡献的行为注定要失败。文章说，西方新闻媒介对6月初中国发生的事情的报道是夸大其词和不负责任的，这些报道中的猜测多于事实。（附图片）
    10月2日，中共中央政治局常委、国务院副总理姚依林率中国党政代表团抵达柏林，受到德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、民德部长会议第一副主席克莱伯的热烈欢迎。代表团将参加民主德国国庆四十周年庆祝活动。
