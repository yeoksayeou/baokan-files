Title: Save on the Use of Official Paper

The British Law Society has recently issued a call to "save on the use of official paper."

This call is not without reason. A recent survey has revealed that the society, which has a total of 500 members, uses an astonishing 9.5 million sheets of official paper annually. This amounts to approximately 19,000 sheets per person per year, with each sheet costing 84.50 pounds. This single expense accounts for 22% of the total stationery budget.

The waste is manifested in various ways: frequently using official paper to write numerous non-essential business letters; using large-sized paper for short letters; submitting numerous meeting minutes; and freely using official paper for drafts, among other things.

The survey report criticizes this wasteful phenomenon.

Irrational paper usage not only increases unnecessary expenses but also hinders effective information transmission. Relevant personnel suggest standardizing stationery specifications and appropriately adjusting certain paper prices to rationalize the use of official paper. They also urge the Law Society to launch a savings campaign.

### 节约使用公文纸

    节约使用公文纸
    “节约使用公文纸”，这是英国法律学会最近发出的呼吁。
    这个呼吁事出有因，刚刚进行的一项调查表明：学会在使用公文纸方面存在着惊人的浪费现象。总共500名会员的学会一年要用掉950万张公文纸，每人每年要用掉约1.9万张价值84.50英镑的纸张，仅此一项就占文具总开销的22％。
    浪费现象是多方面的：频繁地用公文纸写许多对业务并不重要的便函；用大规格的材料纸写内容很短的信件；递交众多的会议记录；随心所欲地用公文纸打草稿等等。
    调查报告批评了这种浪费现象。
    不合理用纸既增加了不必要的开支，也妨碍了有效的信息传递。有关人士建议应统一文具规格，适当调整某些纸价，以期对公文纸的使用合理化，并要求法律学会开展一场节约运动。
