Honecker Meets with Democratic Party Leaders to Discuss Grand Strategy
Emphasizes Unwavering Commitment to Socialism

BERLIN, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) — The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, Erich Honecker, met with the leaders of various democratic parties on October 13 at the Party Central Committee building. They exchanged views on the current domestic situation and discussed grand strategies.

Honecker emphasized that the socialism of the GDR must not be shaken. Instead, it should be continuously improved through the implementation of the strategic idea of combining continuity with innovation. He said that everything that has been tested should be continued, while anything outdated or hindering progress must be overcome. All citizens of the GDR, regardless of their social background, worldview, or religious beliefs, have their place. Socialism provides a broad scope for the personal development of each individual. Therefore, we cannot remain indifferent to any citizen who wishes to sever ties with our country, regardless of the reasons. In the GDR, every citizen can contribute to making socialism more attractive through their labor. Therefore, we will engage in an open dialogue about the current problems of the democratic republic. We will always remember the goal of serving the people's welfare and providing them with a peaceful future.

Honecker expressed that the friendly parties should continue to play an independent role. The Socialist Unity Party will continue to work with the friendly parties, all democratic organizations, and all social forces within the National Front to fulfill their common responsibilities and contribute to the socialist homeland and the interests of the people.

The leaders of the friendly parties and the chairman of the National Front also spoke. They unanimously expressed their support for the statement of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, pointing out that the democratic republic is a common cause of all classes and parties under the leadership of the working class and its party. This cause is in the interests of the people and will continue to progress with the joint efforts of everyone.

    昂纳克同各民主党派主席共商大计
    强调对社会主义决不动摇
    本报柏林10月14日电　记者许宏治报道：德国统一社会党中央总书记、民主德国国务委员会主席昂纳克13日在党中央大厦会见了各民主党派主席，同他们就当前国内形势交换了看法，共商大计。
    昂纳克强调，民德的社会主义决不能动摇，而应通过贯彻连续性与革新相结合的战略思想，通过改革，不断地继续完善。他说，凡是经受了考验的东西，要继续坚持；凡是过时了的或是阻碍我们前进的东西，必须加以克服。所有民德公民，不论社会出身如何，世界观和宗教信仰如何，都有他的地位。社会主义为每个人的个人发展提供了广阔的天地。所以，不能对任何公民宣布与我们国家脱离关系的事漠不关心，不论他是出于何种原因。在民德，每个公民都能通过自己的劳动为使社会主义更有吸引力而作出贡献。因此，我们将对民主德国当前存在的问题进行公开对话。我们永远记住为人民谋福利，使人民有和平的未来这个目的。
    昂纳克表示，各友党应继续独立发挥作用，统一社会党将继续与各友党、与所有民主团体及全国阵线内各种社会力量一起，自觉履行共同责任，为社会主义祖国及人民利益作出贡献。
    各友党主席及全国阵线主席也发了言。他们一致表示支持统一社会党中央政治局的申明，指出民主德国是各阶层、各党派团体在工人阶级及其政党领导下的共同事业，这一事业符合人民利益，今后还将在大家的共同努力下继续前进。
