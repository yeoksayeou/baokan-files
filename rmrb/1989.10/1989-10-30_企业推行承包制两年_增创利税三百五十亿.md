The widespread implementation of the contract responsibility system in Chinese industrial enterprises has yielded significant economic benefits. According to the Office of the State Council's Enterprise Management Guidance Committee, over the past two years, state-owned industrial enterprises under the national budget have generated an additional 35 billion yuan in taxes and profits. This amount is equivalent to the total increase in taxes and profits from these enterprises between 1980 and 1986.

It is reported that since the end of 1986, China's enterprise reforms have entered a deepening stage focused on transforming the operating mechanisms and implementing various forms of the contract responsibility system. By the end of 1988, more than 90% of state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises had adopted the contract system, with 95% of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises doing the same. A senior official from the Office of the State Council's Enterprise Management Guidance Committee recently stated at the 9th International Enterprise Management Symposium that the rapid promotion of the contract system is due to its alignment with China's national conditions. It reflects the current level of productivity and objective requirements, effectively addressing the issues of rights, responsibilities, and interests among the state, enterprises, and employees. This system grants enterprises sufficient operational autonomy and relative economic responsibility and benefits, thereby motivating both enterprises and employees.

The official noted that the widespread adoption of the contract system not only reversed the 20-month decline in enterprise profits before its implementation but also promoted reforms within enterprises, including leadership structures, distribution systems, employment practices, and personnel management. Additionally, it has provided momentum and conditions for the overall economic system reform.

　　企业推行承包制两年
　　增创利税三百五十亿
    据新华社北京10月29日电　（记者吴士深）在我国工业企业普遍推行的承包经营责任制已经带来巨大的经济效益。据国务院企业管理指导委员会办公室透露，全国预算内工业企业承包两年增创利税350亿元，相当于1980年至1986年6年间企业所增税利的总和。
    据介绍，自1986年底开始，我国企业改革进入以转变经营机制为重点、推行多种形式承包经营责任制的深化改革阶段。到1988年底，全国预算内工商企业承包面超过90％，大中型工业企业达95％。国务院企业管理指导委员会办公室负责人近日在第9次企业管理国际讨论会上评介说，承包制之所以能迅速推开，是因为它符合中国国情，反映了现阶段我国生产力水平和客观要求，较好地解决了国家、企业和职工之间的责权利关系，使企业有充分的经营自主权力和相对独立的经济责任及经济利益，有利于调动企业和职工积极性。
    这位负责人说，承包制的普遍推开，不仅一举扭转了承包前连续20个月企业利润滑坡，而且促进了企业内部领导体制、分配体制、用工制度、干部管理制度等方面的改革。同时，也为整个经济体制改革提供了动力和条件。
