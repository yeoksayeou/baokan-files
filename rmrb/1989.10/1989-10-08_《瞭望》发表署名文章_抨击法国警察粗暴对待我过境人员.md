The latest issue of *Outlook* magazine published a signed article titled "Outrageous Behavior" criticizing the French police's brutal treatment of 21 Chinese transit passengers on September 8. The article points out that such actions by the French side not only seriously violate the basic rights of Chinese individuals to personal freedom but also damage the friendship between the peoples of China and France.

The article states that in recent times, French border police at Paris Airport have repeatedly and seriously violated international laws and customs, discriminating against, harassing, and brutally treating Chinese transit passengers. The most serious incident occurred on September 8, when French police detained 21 Chinese transit passengers for over 10 hours. They were not only completely deprived of their personal freedom but also suffered severe humiliation.

A medical team of 13 people bound for the Gabon Republic and 8 businesspeople headed for Mauritania and Sierra Leone arrived at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport on a French Airlines 747 flight from Frankfurt, Germany, at 8:10 PM Paris time on September 8. They were subjected to unreasonable harassment and brutal treatment by French border police. Their passports, tickets, and handbags were forcibly taken away, and they were illegally searched.

During the negotiations, the 21 Chinese transit passengers sternly pointed out: "We are international travelers with valid documents and complete procedures. Our freedom of movement and physical health should be guaranteed, and the police must immediately allow us to pass." They requested to make a phone call to the Chinese Embassy in France, but this was refused.

After a resolute struggle, around midnight, the French side released 4 Chinese businesspeople bound for Sierra Leone, who were then "escorted" by two police officers to a nearby hotel. These two police officers demanded that the Chinese businesspeople immediately pay over 7,600 francs for food and lodging, which was immediately refused. The French side then placed these 4 Chinese individuals in two rooms, not allowing them to make any external phone calls. The remaining 17 Chinese transit passengers were detained in a luggage hall at the airport, guarded by 4 police officers. In the empty hall, there were only a few steel chairs. They were dressed in light summer clothing, but Paris in September is already cool, and the night air was particularly chilly. They were inhumanely detained for 14 and a half hours, without a drop of water or a grain of rice. By 9 AM, several people had fallen ill from the ordeal, yet the French authorities, who always claim to protect "human rights," remained indifferent.

Through the stern intervention of the Chinese Embassy in France, at 10 AM on September 9, a French border police officer finally appeared at the scene and agreed to release all the Chinese transit passengers. However, he evaded the issue by saying, "The investigation results show no problems; this was a misunderstanding."

The article points out that the dignity of Chinese citizens will not be tolerated by anyone. The French border police's detention of Chinese transit passengers seriously violated their basic rights to personal freedom, damaged the friendship between the peoples of China and France, and drew serious attention from relevant Chinese authorities. The Chinese Foreign Ministry was instructed to conduct negotiations on this matter, demanding that the French side immediately stop such discriminatory, harassing, and brutal treatment of Chinese transit passengers.

The article concludes by expressing further outrage, noting that after this incident, the French government continued to take actions harmful to Sino-French relations, even allowing the "Chinese Democracy Front," which aims to overthrow the Chinese government, to hold a "founding meeting" in Paris. Some French friends have expressed deep concern about the deteriorating trend in Sino-French relations. They pointed out that the peoples of France and China are friendly, and the French people value the friendly relations between the two countries, personally established by General de Gaulle and Chairman Mao Zedong. They do not want to see the authorities doing anything that damages the feelings of the two peoples and causes heartache.

    抨击法国警察粗暴对待我过境人员
    新华社北京10月6日电　最新一期《瞭望》杂志就9月8日法国警察粗暴拘押21名中国过境人员的严重事件发表题为《令人愤慨的粗暴行为》的署名文章，指出法国方面的这种行径不但严重侵犯了中国人员人身自由的基本权利，而且损害了中法两国人民之间的友谊。
    文章说，最近一段时期来，法国边防警察在巴黎机场连续多次严重违反国际法准则和国际惯例，歧视、刁难和粗暴对待中国因公过境人员。其中最严重的一次是9月8日，法国警察拘押21名中国过境人员长达10多个小时，他们不仅完全失去了人身自由，人格也受到严重侮辱。
    中国赴加蓬共和国医疗队一行13人以及赴毛里塔尼亚和塞拉利昂的经贸人员8人，9月8日巴黎时间晚8时10分，乘坐法国航空公司的747班机从联邦德国法兰克福飞抵巴黎戴高乐机场时，遭到法国边防警察无理刁难和粗暴对待。他们的护照、机票和手提包被强行取走，还被非法搜了身。
    在交涉中，21名中国过境人员严正地指出：“我们是持有合法证件、手续完备的国际旅客。我们的行动自由和身体健康应得到保证，警方必须立即放行。”他们要求打电话同中国驻法国大使馆取得联系，竟然遭到拒绝。
    经过坚决斗争，深夜12时左右，法方才将中国赴塞拉利昂的4名经贸人员放行，由两名警察“护送”到机场附近的一家旅馆。这两名警察还要中国经贸人员立即支付7600多法郎食宿费，当场遭到拒绝，法方把这4名中国人安置在两个房间里，不许他们向外界打电话联系。其余17名中国过境人员被关押在机场的一个行李大厅里，由4名警察看守。在空荡荡的大厅里，只有几把钢制坐椅。他们穿的是单衣夏装，而9月的巴黎，天气已凉，深夜更是寒气袭人。他们被非人道地关押了长达14个半小时，没喝一滴水，没进一粒米。到9日凌晨，就有好几个人被折磨病倒，而一直标榜最维护“人权”的法国当局却不闻不问。
    经中国驻法国大使馆的严正交涉，9日上午10时，法国边防警察的一个头目才来到现场，同意放行全部中国过境人员。但他搪塞说：“审查结果没有问题，这是一场误会。”
    这篇文章指出，中国公民的尊严决不容许遭到任何人的侵犯和侮辱。法国边防警察拘押中国过境人员，严重侵犯了他们人身自由的基本权利，有损于中法两国人民的友谊，引起了中国有关方面的严重关注。中国外交部奉命就此事进行了交涉，要求法方立即制止这种歧视、刁难和粗暴对待中国过境人员的错误做法。
    文章最后指出，更加令人愤慨的是，在这之后，法国政府继续采取损害中法关系的行为，甚至允许以颠覆中国政府为宗旨的“民主中国阵线”在巴黎举行“成立大会”。一些法国友好人士对法中关系恶化的趋向深表关切。他们指出，法中两国人民是友好的，法国人民珍视由戴高乐将军和毛泽东主席亲自缔结的两国友好关系，再也不愿看到当局做出有损于两国人民感情、令人痛心的事来。
