The Kuwaiti Arab Fund for Economic Development is the first fund organization in developing countries to provide financial aid abroad, and it has significant influence in the Third World. It has extensive cooperative relations with our country. On an autumn afternoon, the author interviewed Badar Humaydi, the General Manager of the fund, who was visiting Beijing at the invitation of the Longcheng Hotel.

The General Manager is tall and imposing, with a graceful demeanor and eyes full of enthusiasm and intelligence, obviously a capable and shrewd businessman. He first briefly introduced the situation of the Kuwaiti Arab Fund for Economic Development.

The fund was established on January 1, 1961, and has a history of 28 years. It is a government agency of Kuwait, established with the purpose of helping developing countries build some projects through loans. When it was first established, the fund had only 50 million Kuwaiti dinars (1 dinar is approximately $3.34), and it only provided loans to Arab countries. Later, it gradually developed to cover all developing countries, and its funds increased by several times. By 1988, the fund had approximately 2 billion dinars, and more than 60 countries had received loans, including 16 Arab countries, 28 African countries, and 15 Asian countries. The total loan amount was approximately 1.46 billion dinars. The loans were mainly used for basic construction projects in developing countries, such as industry, agriculture, transportation, water and electricity.

Since its establishment in 1961, the fund has also invested in, provided grants, and offered technical assistance to more than 40 countries and enterprises, with a total amount of approximately 22 million dinars. The funds provided by the fund to foreign countries account for 3.81% of Kuwait's entire national income.

When talking about cooperation with China, General Manager Badar said that in 1982, the fund signed the first agreement with China, and then provided loans to several projects, including the Tianjin Microcar (Tianjin Dafa). This time, he came to China and signed a loan agreement for the Benxi Beita Ball Mill Cast Iron Pipe Factory project with Liaoning Province. So far, the fund has provided loans for 12 projects in China, with a total amount of approximately $300 million.

Regarding the prospects of cooperation between China and the Kuwaiti Arab Fund for Economic Development, Mr. Badar firmly said, "We are willing to cooperate with our Chinese brothers and hope that this cooperation will continue and develop into broader fields. This cooperation will help to further strengthen the relationship between the two countries. We will also prioritize providing loans to some Chinese projects and conduct investigations and negotiations on airport, port, and other projects."

In the end, General Manager Badar said: "In the past three years, I have visited China four times, and this is my fifth visit. Each time, I have seen many improvements. Since the implementation of the open-door policy, China has developed rapidly. Undoubtedly, this time I came to China, I am particularly concerned about the situation in Beijing. Through observation, I really did not find any difference from before. The country continues to open up, people's lives are normal, and the situation in Beijing is stable and safe."

    “愿同中国兄弟合作”
    ——访阿拉伯经济发展基金会总经理
    刘元培
    科威特阿拉伯经济发展基金会是发展中国家第一个向国外提供资金援助的基金组织，在第三世界颇有影响，与我国有广泛的合作关系。初秋的一个下午，笔者在北京长城饭店采访了应邀来访的该基金会总经理巴德尔·胡迈迪先生。
    总经理身材魁梧，举止倜傥，眼光里充满热情和聪敏，显然是一位精明能干的实业家。他首先简要介绍了科威特阿拉伯经济发展基金会的情况。
    基金会于1961年1月1日成立，至今已有28年历史。它是科威特政府机构，成立的目的是通过贷款的形式，帮助发展中国家建设一些项目。初建时，基金会仅有5000万科威特第纳尔（1第纳尔约合3.34美元），只向阿拉伯国家提供贷款，后来逐步发展到面向所有发展中国家，资金也增加了几十倍。到1988年，基金会约有20亿第纳尔，接受贷款的国家多达60余个，其中阿拉伯国家16个，非洲国家28个，亚洲国家15个。贷款总金额约14.6亿第纳尔。贷款主要用于发展中国家的工业、农业、交通、运输、水电等基本建设项目。
    自1961年成立以来，基金会还向40多个国家和企业投资、提供赠款和技术援助，总额约达2200万第纳尔。基金会向国外提供的资金占科威特整个国民经济收入的3.81％。
    巴德尔总经理在谈到与中国的合作时说，1982年，基金会与中国签订了第一个协议，随后，又向天津微型汽车（天津大发）等几个项目贷款。这次来华又与辽宁省签订了本溪北台球墨铸铁管厂项目贷款的协议。至今，基金会在中国贷款的项目已达12个，总金额约3亿美元。
    对于中国和科威特阿拉伯经济发展基金会的合作前景，巴德尔先生坚定地说，我们愿意同中国兄弟合作，希望这种合作继续下去，并向更广泛的领域发展。这种合作有助于进一步加强两国间的关系。我们还要优先向中国的一些项目提供贷款，并将就建设机场、港口等项目进行考察和谈判。
    巴德尔总经理最后说：“过去三年，我访华四次，这次是第五次。每次我总能发现不少进步。自实行对外开放以来，中国发展很快。无疑，我这次来中国，特别关心北京的局势。通过观察，我确实没有发现同以前有什么不同，国家继续开放，人民生活正常，北京局势稳定安全。”
