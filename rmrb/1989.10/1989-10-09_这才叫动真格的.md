	This is what you call getting serious

	Pang Guanqing

	We have always advocated for the serious handling of illegal and disorderly behavior. However, in actual execution, it often turns out to be "lenient and light," without getting serious. This makes people feel that there is more thunder than rain, or that it is all talk and no action. There are many such examples, too numerous to count. Therefore, it has caused dissatisfaction among many people.

	"Cracking down on pornography and illegal publications" is a big deal. Eliminating "spiritual opium" is crucial for the rise and fall of the nation and the well-being of future generations. How to thoroughly carry out the "crackdown" is a consensus among those with foresight: to block the source. It must be admitted that this aspect has not been done well in the past.

	From the second page of the People's Daily on August 29, I read a piece of news: the relevant departments of Sichuan Province decided to expel from the party and dismiss the position of Zhang Li, the president of Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences Press, and demote the editor Li Jiwei. Their criminal offenses will be handled by the judicial authorities according to law. Reading this news made me very happy. What kind of book is "The Complete Biography of Du Yuesheng"? The newspaper introduces it as follows: "This book insults the Communist Party of China, its leaders, and patriotic democratic personages in many places, defames the workers' movement and the people's revolutionary struggle, praises Chiang Kai-shek's 'anti-communist' counter-revolutionary crimes, and beautifies and praises Du Yuesheng." Is it not appropriate to give serious treatment to the illegal publication of such a book?

	I praise the handling of this case, feeling that such treatment can be called "serious," and that it is truly getting serious in "cracking down on pornography and blocking the source." Only in this way can the rectification of laws and discipline have hope.

    这才叫动真格的
    庞观清
    对于违法乱纪行为，我们历来都主张严肃处理。但是实际执行情况，往往是“从宽从轻”，并不动真格的，使人感到雷声大，雨点小，或者是干打雷，不下雨。这类例子很多，不胜枚举。因此，引起很多群众的不满。
      “扫黄”是件大事，清除“精神鸦片”，关乎国家兴衰，子孙后代的福祸。如何把“扫黄”搞彻底，有识之士一致认为：要堵住源头。应当承认，过去这方面做得很不够。
    从人民日报8月29日第二版上读到一条消息：四川省有关部门决定对擅自出版反共书籍《杜月笙全传》的省社科院出版社社长张力、编辑李嘉玮分别予以开除党籍、撤职、降级等处分，对他们触犯刑律问题由司法机关依法处理。读了这条消息十分高兴。《杜月笙全传》是本何等样的书呢？报纸介绍“此书多处辱骂中国共产党、共产党领导人及爱国民主人士，诬蔑工人运动和人民革命斗争，赞颂蒋介石‘清党’等反革命罪行，美化吹捧杜月笙。”违法出版这样的书，还不该受到严肃处理吗？
    笔者称赞对这个案例的处理，是感到这样的处理才能称得上“严肃”，才是在“扫黄堵源”上动了真格的。只有这样，整顿法纪才大有希望。
