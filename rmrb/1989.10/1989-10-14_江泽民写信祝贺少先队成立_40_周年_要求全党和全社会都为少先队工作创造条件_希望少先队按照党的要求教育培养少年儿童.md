Today is the 40th anniversary of the founding of the China Young Pioneers. CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin wrote a letter to the Young Pioneers and their leaders across the country, extending warm congratulations on behalf of the Party Central Committee. The full text is as follows:

	Young Pioneers and Young Pioneer workers,

	Today marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the China Young Pioneers, an organization created by the Party. On behalf of the Party Central Committee, I extend warm congratulations to the 130 million Young Pioneers across the country! I also express my respect and greetings to the broad cadre of instructors and comrades who have dedicated themselves to the work of the Young Pioneers.

	The Young Pioneers are the reserve force for the socialist modernization of our motherland and the great school where young children learn socialism and communism. Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Youth League, the Young Pioneers have made active contributions to cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. They have also cultivated outstanding Young Pioneers like Lai Ning, who are worthy of emulation. The Party hopes that you will continue to advance in this direction.

	The revolutionary cause of the proletariat requires the unremitting efforts of generation after generation. Today's young children will bear the responsibility of building a socialist motherland in the 21st century. The cultivation of successors must start from a young age. The work of the Young Pioneers is the work of shaping the builders of the future. For the bright future of China, the work of the Young Pioneers should not only be managed by the Communist Youth League and the educational system, but also by the entire Party and the whole society. We must create conditions and solve difficulties for the Young Pioneers, so that the Young Pioneers organization can fully play its role in uniting, educating, and guiding the broad masses of young children.

	I hope that the Young Pioneers will, in accordance with the Party's requirements for the next generation, persistently carry out basic communist education for the broad masses of young children. I hope that all Young Pioneers across the country will learn from Lai Ning, strive to catch up with the advanced, establish revolutionary ideals, cultivate noble morals, study cultural and scientific knowledge well, and train a strong physique. In accordance with the teachings of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, become successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat who have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

	Jiang Zemin

    江泽民写信祝贺少先队成立40周年
    要求全党和全社会都为少先队工作创造条件
    希望少先队按照党的要求教育培养少年儿童
    本报北京10月13日讯　今天是中国少年先锋队成立40周年纪念日。中共中央总书记江泽民写信给全国的少先队员和少先队工作者，代表党中央向他们表示热烈的祝贺。全文如下：少先队员和少先队工作者同志们：
    今天是党缔造的中国少年先锋队建队40周年纪念日，我代表党中央谨向全国一亿三千万少先队员表示热烈的祝贺！向为少先队工作付出心血的广大辅导员和关心、从事少先队工作的同志们表示敬意和问候！
    少先队是祖国社会主义现代化建设的预备队，也是少年儿童自己学习社会主义和共产主义的大学校。40年来，在共青团组织的带领下，少先队在培养无产阶级革命事业接班人中做出了积极的贡献；还培养了像赖宁这样的值得大家学习的优秀少先队员。党希望你们在这个方向上继续前进。
    无产阶级革命事业需要一代又一代艰苦不懈的努力，今天的少年儿童将要担负起21世纪建设社会主义祖国的重任，培养接班人必须从小抓起。少先队的工作正是塑造未来建设者的工作，为了中国光明的未来，对少先队工作，不仅共青团和教育系统应该管，全党都应该管，全社会都应该管，要为少先队创造条件，解决困难，让少先队组织发挥好团结、教育、引导广大少年儿童的作用。
    我希望少先队按照党对下一代的要求，坚持不懈地对广大少年儿童进行基础的共产主义教育。希望全国的少先队员们向赖宁学习，向先进看齐，树立革命理想，培养高尚道德，学好文化科学知识，锻炼强健体魄，按照邓小平同志的教导，成为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
                  江泽民
