When mentioning the Gobi Desert, people often think of endless sand dunes, the tinkling of camel bells, and the poetic scene of a camel caravan slowly moving along the horizon under the setting sun.

The South Gobi tourist base, under the jurisdiction of the Mongolian National Tourism Bureau, is located here. Although the natural conditions are not as good as the lush grasslands of the northern Hangai region, it is not entirely covered in endless sand.

Upon arriving, my biggest impression was that the modern lifestyle has also blown into the depths of the Gobi Desert. The base is surrounded by rows of white poplar trees. Inside the base, there is a large area of neatly arranged silver-colored Mongolian yurts of various sizes, which shine brightly under the sun. The living conditions are comfortable, and there are bathrooms for showering, as well as a modern restaurant, bar, and a foreign exchange shop with a variety of goods.

During the summer tourist season, there are regular flights between the capital Ulaanbaatar and the tourist base. The base manager proudly told us that there are at least three advantages to traveling here: a quiet environment, abundant sunshine, and fresh air. Additionally, you can enjoy the unique natural scenery of the Gobi region and visit the fossil sites of ancient animals, including dinosaurs.

The South Gobi has its own enchanting places. "Ulaan Tsutgalan" is one of the 13 nature reserves established in Mongolia, located about 50-60 kilometers northwest of Dalanzadgad, the capital of South Gobi Province. Here, you can not only enjoy the continuous mountains, lush green grasslands, and fragrant wildflowers, but also often see vultures, eagles, and rare wild animals such as ibex and wild goats soaring and roaming between the blue sky and green grass. Some stand on the cliffs looking around, while others run through the mountains. Whenever this happens, the driver-guide stops the car to allow tourists to observe and take photos. A Mexican tourist exclaimed that under the blue sky and white clouds, the majestic mountains and the ibex and wild goats running everywhere on the high mountains and cliffs form a very beautiful picture. For tourists who love the natural beauty of mountains and rivers, seeing such picturesque scenery in the "Ulaan Tsutgalan" nature reserve, which is generally considered a Gobi Desert, is indeed surprising.

    戈壁滩上的旅游基地
    王义民
    提到戈壁沙漠，人们往往会联想到黄沙万里，驼铃叮叮，夕阳里，一列骆驼商队在地平线上缓缓移动那种富有诗意的大漠景色。
    属于蒙古国家旅游局管辖的南戈壁旅游基地就建立在这里。虽然自然条件比不上北部水草丰盛的杭爱地区，可也并非黄沙万里。
    身临其境，我最大的感受是现代生活气息同样吹进了戈壁滩的深处。基地四周栽种着一排排白杨。基地内整齐有秩地排列着大小适中的一大片银白色蒙古包，在阳光的照射下熠熠发光，不仅居住条件舒适，而且有可供洗澡的浴间和陈设考究的现代化餐厅、酒吧以及商品比较齐全的外汇商店等。
    在夏日的旅游旺季，每天有定期的航班飞行于首都乌兰巴托与旅游基地之间。基地负责人骄傲地告诉我们，到此地旅游起码有三大优点：环境幽静，阳光充足，空气清新。此外，还可欣赏戈壁地区别具的自然风光和参观包括恐龙在内的许多古生物化石的遗址。
    南戈壁有其足以令人神往的地方。“兀鹫口”是蒙古目前已建立的13个自然保护区之一，位于南戈壁省会达兰扎德格德市西北约五六十公里处。这里不仅可以欣赏连绵的山峦、碧绿如茵的草地、扑鼻芳香的野花，而且不时可见盘旋于蓝天绿草之间的兀鹫、雄鹰和栖息于山野的大角盘羊、野山羊等稀有野生动物。它们有的站在悬崖上四处观望，有的在山间奔驰。每当这时，司机兼向导就停下汽车让游人观看和拍照。一位墨西哥游人感叹，在蓝天白云下巍峨耸立的群山和在高山峻岭上到处奔跑的大角盘羊和野山羊，构成了一幅非常美丽的图画……对于酷爱大自然山川美景的旅游者来说，在一般认为是戈壁沙漠的“兀鹫口”自然保护区内能见到如此旖旎的景色，实在出人意料。
