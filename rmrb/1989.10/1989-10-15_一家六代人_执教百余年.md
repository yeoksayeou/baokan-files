A family of six generations has been dedicated to teaching for over a century. In Shanxi Province's Shenqi County, the Ma family, starting with Ma Fuhong, has experienced three dynasties and continued teaching for 120 years without interruption. This remarkable story has recently been recorded in the Shenqi County Gazetteer.

The Ma family's teaching tradition began with Ma Fuhong's great-grandfather during the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty. Since then, each generation has passed down the torch, with six generations sincerely dedicating their lives to the teaching profession and committing to rural education.

The first generation to teach in the Ma family, Ma Buxiao, was a jinshi (a successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations). The third generation, Ma Xichang, was a local xiucai (a successful candidate in the county-level imperial examinations). The fourth generation, Ma Yu, graduated from the National Normal School in Taiyuan in 1928. Influenced by his ancestors, he returned to the countryside to teach, continuing until his retirement in 1962. During his career, he taught in eight primary and secondary schools in Shenqi, Shuozhou, Yingxian, and Pianguan, educating tens of thousands of students.

The current head of the family, Ma Fuhong, who is 47 years old, has been teaching for 27 years. His only son, Ma Wensheng, ranked second in the county in the junior high school entrance examination and was admitted to the Wuzhai Normal School. After graduating, he returned to teach at Taipingzhuang Middle School. His wife also comes from a family of teachers, making them a perfect match. The young couple now both teach at Yijing Middle School.

    一家六代人  执教百余年
    祖辈从教，世代相传，山西神池县马富荣一家六代人经历三个朝代，延继一百二十年执教从未间断。这件事最近被载入神池县县志。
    马富荣的高祖父于清朝同治年间开始教私塾，此后上代传下代，六代人诚心诚意终生以教师为业，安心于乡村教育。
    马家第一代教书的马步霄是名贡生，第三代的马熙昌是乡里的秀才。第四代马瑜一九二八年毕业于太原国民师范学校，受其祖父辈的影响，回乡村教书，直到一九六二年退休，其间在神池、朔县、应县、偏关八所中小学任教，学生数以万计。
    现年四十七岁的马富荣已有二十七年教龄。他的独生儿子马文生在初中毕业考试中以全县第二名的成绩考进了五寨师范，毕业后回到太平庄乡中学任教，他的妻子也出身于教师世家，可谓“门当户对”，现在小夫妻俩同在义井中学任教。
