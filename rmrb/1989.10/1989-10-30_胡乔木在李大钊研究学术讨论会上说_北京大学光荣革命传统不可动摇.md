	Hu Qiaomu, a member of the Central Advisory Commission and deputy head of the Central Party History Leadership Group, said at the Li Dazhao Research Academic Symposium today that Beijing University has a glorious revolutionary tradition that is unshakable under any circumstances.

	The Li Dazhao Research Academic Symposium was jointly organized by the Central Party History Research Office, Beijing University, and five other units. The symposium was held at Beijing University.

	Hu Qiaomu said that Li Dazhao's name is inseparable from Beijing University. His revolutionary activities began at the "Red Building" and the library of Beijing University. Li Dazhao's Marxist Theory Study Society, which he led at Beijing University, received the support of President Cai Yuanpei from the very beginning. The "Kangmu Yi Zhai" (Communist Study Room), named by Li Dazhao and his students, was two rooms specially provided by Cai Yuanpei for the study society's activities. Many of the young people who later became communists were members or corresponding members of this study society. Most of the initial members of the Beijing Communist Group were students and teachers of Beijing University.

	Hu Qiaomu said that Beijing University not only has the tradition of the great patriot and educator Cai Yuanpei, but also the tradition of the great Marxist and revolutionary Li Dazhao. It has the tradition of being one of the main birthplaces of research and propaganda of Marxism and the formation of communism. This tradition shone brightly during the anti-Japanese and anti-American anti-Chiang Kai-shek struggles.

	Hu Qiaomu emphasized that after the founding of New China, Beijing University has developed unprecedentedly in the fields of natural sciences and social sciences teaching and research, reaching new scales and levels. This process has also experienced some painful twists and turns. Nevertheless, Beijing University's glorious revolutionary tradition is unshakable.

	Hu Qiaomu expressed his belief that, whether in terms of historical status or current responsibilities, the teachers and students of Beijing University will, under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, carry forward the revolutionary tradition established by Cai Yuanpei, Li Dazhao, and others.

　　胡乔木在李大钊研究学术讨论会上说
　　北京大学光荣革命传统不可动摇
    新华社北京10月29日电　（记者刘思扬）中顾委常委、中央党史领导小组副组长胡乔木今天在李大钊研究学术讨论会上说，北京大学有着光荣的革命传统，无论如何，这个传统是不可动摇的。
    李大钊研究学术讨论会是由中共中央党史研究室、北京大学等七个单位联合举办的。讨论会在北京大学举行。
    胡乔木说，李大钊的名字与北京大学分不开。他的革命活动是从北大的“红楼”、北大图书馆开始的。李大钊在北大指导的马克思学说研究会一开始就得到校长蔡元培的支持。被李大钊和他的学生定名的“亢慕义斋”（即共产主义斋），就是蔡元培为研究会专门提供作为活动场所的两间房子。后来成为共产主义者的青年，不少是这个研究会的会员或通讯会员。北京共产主义小组的最初成员，大多数也是北大的学生和教师。
    胡乔木说，北京大学不仅有伟大的爱国民主主义者和教育家蔡元培的传统，而且有伟大的马克思主义者和革命家李大钊的传统，有研究和宣传马克思主义、形成共产主义主要发祥地之一的传统。这个传统在抗日救亡运动中，在抗美反蒋斗争中，都曾发出夺目的光辉。
    胡乔木强调说，新中国成立以后，北京大学得到了空前的发展，在自然科学、社会科学的教学和科研方面都达到新的规模和水平。这之间也经历了一些令人痛心的曲折。无论如何，北京大学的光荣革命传统是不可动摇的。
    胡乔木表示相信，无论就历史地位和现实责任来说，北京大学的师生今后一定会在党和政府的领导和关怀之下，把蔡元培、李大钊等创立的革命传统发扬光大。
