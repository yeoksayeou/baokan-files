    The Great Flag
    Ren Huimin

    I was born under that bright red great flag
    My father raised it
    To protect it from flying over the world
    My father's chest was filled with bullets
    He covered the gushing holes
    Like a warhorse neighing
    At the moment of his death, he circled around his master for a long time
    I gradually grew up
    Wearing a red scarf, I thought of the great flag
    Wearing a red skirt, I thought of the great flag
    Seeing red curtains, I thought of the great flag
    The great flag fluttered in the blue sky as ever
    Making my father's grave fiery red
    I want to walk in and tell him
    That flag has already grown into a forest
    Sweetly and freely flying high...
    I vaguely see
    He is still in that posture
    The holes on his body are covered with cockscomb flowers
    My longing for my father grows under the great flag
    The great flag flies higher and higher
    My longing grows deeper and deeper

    大旗
    任惠敏
    我出生在那面鲜红的大旗下
    举旗的是我父亲
    为了保护她在天下飘扬
    父亲的胸脯落满子弹
    他捂住喷涌的一个个洞穴
    如战马嘶鸣
    临终围着主人久久地亲近
    我渐渐长大
    带上红领巾就想到大旗
    穿上红裙子就想到大旗
    看见红窗帘就想到大旗
    大旗一如既往在蓝天下飘舞
    将父亲的墓地映得火红
    我想走进去告诉他
    那旗早已长成林子
    甜甜地自由自在地飞扬……
    我模模糊糊看到
    他还是那个姿势
    身上的洞穴结满了鸡冠花
    我对父亲的怀念从大旗下长
      大
    大旗越升越高
    我的怀念越来越深
