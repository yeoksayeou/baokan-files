On November 7, Namibia will hold its national elections. At that time, South Africa's 74-year illegal occupation of Namibia will come to an end, and Namibia will be reborn as the last country on the African continent to gain independence.

Since April 1 of this year, Namibia has implemented United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, and the South African occupying forces and the military led by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) have formally ceased fire. Subsequently, under the supervision and assistance of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, tens of thousands of refugees who had been living abroad returned to their long-separated homeland, creating conditions for the national elections.

Voter registration began on July 3. SWAPO leaders, headed by Chairman Sam Nujoma, and their members returned to the country one after another to participate in the election campaign. By September 25, the number of registered voters had reached nearly 700,000.

Namibia currently has about 40 to 50 political parties and groups, which can be broadly divided into two major camps: SWAPO and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA). Both have published their election platforms and are actively campaigning.

On July 2, SWAPO held a rally with 20,000 participants in the suburbs of Windhoek. The meeting announced SWAPO's election platform, which advocates for an independent, united, secular, and democratic country, achieving national reconciliation; a foreign policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence, hoping to maintain friendly relations with South Africa, and supporting the South African people's struggle against racism; and in economics, a mixed economy, gradually achieving changes in ownership and fair distribution of national income, but "not considering large-scale nationalization measures in the foreseeable future," and welcoming whites to stay and rebuild the country together.

The DTA's election platform advocates for a non-racial, multi-party democratic country, a free market economy and privatization, and a foreign policy of non-alignment. According to international public opinion, since SWAPO's platform reflects the interests of the vast majority of blacks in Namibia, it is possible that 80% of blacks will vote for SWAPO.

There are about 75,000 whites in Namibia, making up 7% of the population. They control the economic lifelines of the country. According to reports, their current mood is much calmer than it was 10 years ago.

After the United Nations proposed a plan for Namibia's independence in 1978, about 30,000 whites left Namibia. Now, most of them hope for national reconciliation. A recent opinion poll showed that 73% of whites are optimistic about the future. In the northern region of Namibia, the Hereroland, there are 350 white farmers, and since April 1, only 3 have left. This situation is also a favorable factor for the smooth conduct of the elections. Additionally, last month, SWAPO and the DTA, along with 10 other parties, jointly signed the Election Guidelines, creating a good political atmosphere and conditions for the smooth conduct of the elections.

However, historical experience tells us that the South African rulers will not easily leave this land they have occupied for over 70 years and will always try to create incidents to delay Namibia's independence.

Recently, African countries, in a letter to the President of the United Nations Security Council, pointed out that South Africa is attempting to sabotage the elections and expressed concern that the UN forces are not strong enough, calling for an emergency meeting to discuss the "serious situation" in Namibia. This concern is not without reason.

Foreign media analysis suggests that SWAPO is likely to win the November elections, but whether it can achieve the goal of one-party rule remains to be seen.

　　独立大选前夕的纳米比亚
　　鲍世绍
    11月7日，纳米比亚将举行全国大选。届时，南非当局对纳米比亚长达74年的非法占领将告结束，纳米比亚将获得新生，成为非洲大陆最后一个赢得独立的国家。
    自今年4月1日起，纳米比亚开始实施联合国安理会435号决议，南非占领军与西南非洲人民组织领导的军队之间正式停火。此后，在联合国过渡期援助团的监督和帮助下，流亡在国外的数万名难民回到了久别的家园，为全国大选创造了条件。
    7月3日开始选民登记工作，以努乔马主席为首的西南非洲人民组织领导人及其成员先后回国，参加竞选活动。到9月25日，选民登记人数有近70万。
    纳米比亚现有各种政党和政治团体四五十个，基本上可分为两大集团，即西南非洲人民组织（简称人组）和特恩哈尔民主联盟（简称联盟）。它们都已经发表了竞选纲领，积极开展竞选活动。
    7月2日，人组在温得和克市郊举行了2万人参加的群众大会。会上公布了人组的竞选纲领，它主张建立一个独立、统一、世俗、民主的国家，实现民族和解；对外奉行不结盟和和平共处的睦邻政策，希望同南非保持友好关系，并支持南非人民反对种族主义的斗争；在经济上，将实行混合经济，并争取逐步“实现所有制方面的改变和国民收入的公平分配”，但“在可预见的未来，不考虑实行大规模的国有化措施”，并且欢迎白人留下来一起重建国家。
    联盟的竞选纲领主张建立一个非种族主义的多党制的民主国家，奉行自由市场经济和私有化，外交上实行不结盟政策。据国际舆论界估计，由于人组提出的纲领反映了占全纳米比亚人口中绝大多数的黑人的利益，可能将有80％的黑人投人组的票。
    纳米比亚的白人约有7.5万，占人口的7％。他们操纵着国家的经济命脉。据报道，他们目前的心情比10年前要平静得多。
    1978年联合国提出实现纳独立的计划后，约有3万白人离开了纳米比亚。而今，他们多数希望实现民族和解。最近一次民意测验表明，有73％的白人对前途表示乐观。纳米比亚北部的赫鲁特方丹地区有350个白人农场主，自4月1日以来，只有3个外迁。这种情况也是纳米比亚顺利进行大选的一个有利因素。另外，上个月，人组还与联盟等10个党派共同签署了选举指导法，为大选的顺利进行创造了良好的政治气氛和条件。
    然而，历史经验告诉人们，南非统治者决不会轻易从这块占领了70余年的土地离去，总想制造一些事端推迟纳米比亚独立的到来。
    最近，非洲国家在给联合国安理会主席的信中指出南非正设法破坏大选，担心联合国部队力量不够，要求召开紧急会议，讨论纳米比亚的“严重事态”。这种担心不是没有道理的。
    外国报刊分析认为，人组大概会赢得11月大选的胜利，但它能否实现一家掌权的目标，尚不好断言。
