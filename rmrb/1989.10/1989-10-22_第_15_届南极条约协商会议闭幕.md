The 15th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting concluded late last night after more than 10 days of intense debate. The French Minister of the Environment announced at noon today that the attending countries agreed to hold a special consultative meeting next year to specifically discuss environmental protection of the Antarctic continent. He believes that next year's meeting will also face many difficulties, with the United States and Britain still insisting on the position of exploiting mineral resources.

This meeting adopted 12 proposals related to the protection of the Antarctic environment, such as regulations to prevent the discharge of marine pollutants, the impact of human activities on the Antarctic environment, and strengthening international cooperation in scientific research activities such as meteorology and communications.

It is understood that although the attending countries have no objections to the principles of Antarctic environmental protection, there are serious disagreements on specific issues involving national interests. Currently, Australia, France, and 5 other countries have territorial claims over the Antarctic continent. After the "Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities," also known as the "Wellington Convention," was adopted last year, Australia and France suddenly changed their stance before this meeting, opposing any activities to exploit mineral resources in the Antarctic and proposing to conclude a comprehensive convention for the protection of the Antarctic environment.

The opposing side believes that environmental protection should not be opposed to scientific research activities, and the "Wellington Convention" has already limited mineral resource development to the lowest level.

The Chinese delegation stated that through the long-term joint efforts of the Antarctic Treaty signatory countries, the Antarctic Treaty system has provided a protective mechanism for the Antarctic environment and its related ecological environment, but this protective mechanism is not yet perfect, and we still face serious challenges. If we cannot shoulder the responsibility of effectively protecting the Antarctic environment and its related ecosystems, human survival will face great danger.

The 16th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting will be held in West Germany in 1991.

### 第15届南极条约协商会议闭幕

　　第15届南极条约协商会议闭幕
    本报巴黎10月21日电　记者吕网大报道：经过10多天的激烈争吵，第15届南极条约协商会议昨天深夜在此间闭幕。法国环境部长今天中午宣布，与会国家同意明年召开一次特别协商会议，专门讨论南极大陆的环境保护问题。他认为，明年的会议也将面临许多困难，美国、英国仍坚持开采矿产资源的立场。
    这次会议通过了12项有关保护南极环境的建议，如防止海洋污染的废物排放规定、人类活动对南极环境影响以及加强气象、通讯等科学考察活动的国际合作等。
    据了解，虽然与会国对南极环境保护的原则没有异议，但涉及到各国利益的具体问题，便出现严重分歧意见。目前澳大利亚、法国等7个国家对南极大陆有领土要求。去年关于“南极矿产资源活动管理公约”即“惠灵顿公约”通过后，澳大利亚和法国在本届会议前突然转变立场，反对任何在南极开采矿产资源的活动，建议缔结一项全面保护南极环境的公约。
    与此对立的一方认为，不能把环境保护与科学考察活动对立起来，“惠灵顿公约”已把矿产资源开发限制在最低限度。
    中国代表团发言指出，在南极条约各缔约国的长期共同努力下，南极条约体系为南极环境与其相关的生态环境提供了一套保护机制，但这个保护机制还不完善，我们还面临严重的挑战。我们如果不能承担起切实保护南极环境和与其相关的生态系统的重担，人类的生存将面临极大的危险。
    第16届南极条约协商会议1991年将在西德举行。
