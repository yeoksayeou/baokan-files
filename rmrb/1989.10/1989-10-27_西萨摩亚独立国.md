The Independent State of Western Samoa is located in the central part of the Polynesian Islands in the South Pacific. It is an ancient and beautiful island nation. The country is composed of two large islands, Savai'i and Upolu, and seven smaller islands, covering an area of 2,946 square kilometers. The population is 162,000, of which 90 percent are Polynesian Samoans. The official language is Samoan, and English is widely spoken. The capital is Apia.

Western Samoa is in the Southern Hemisphere and has a tropical rainforest climate. The islands are mostly volcanic, with rolling hills, abundant rainfall, dense forests, and fertile soil. The economy is primarily agricultural, with main products including coconuts, cocoa, bananas, taro, and breadfruit. Fisheries and forest resources are also abundant. The main exports are coconut products, cocoa, bananas, and timber. Industries include agricultural processing, food, clothing, and sawmilling.

Western Samoa has a long history. Around 3,000 years ago, Samoans migrated from Southeast Asia and settled here. They later established an independent kingdom. In the mid-19th century, Western powers successively invaded, and in 1899, it became a German colony. During World War I, New Zealand declared war on Germany and occupied Western Samoa. After the war, the League of Nations entrusted Western Samoa to New Zealand for administration. After World War II, the United Nations designated the area as a New Zealand trust territory. On January 1, 1962, Western Samoa gained independence, becoming the first independent nation in the South Pacific Islands. The Western Samoan government pursues a policy of friendship with all countries, advocating the maintenance of national independence and sovereignty, opposing colonialism, opposing the arms race, supporting the Non-Aligned Movement, and demanding the establishment of a new international economic order. It actively participates in the activities of the South Pacific Forum and regional cooperation, advocating the establishment of a nuclear-free South Pacific.

As early as 1903, the first batch of Chinese people crossed the ocean to reach Western Samoa, working alongside local residents and contributing to economic development. On November 6, 1975, China and Western Samoa established diplomatic relations. In September 1976 and June 1980, the heads of state of Western Samoa, Malietoa Tanumafili II, and Prime Minister Tupua Tamasese Lealofi I visited China. In March 1979 and April 1985, Vice Premier Chen Mu Hua and General Secretary Hu Yaobang visited Western Samoa. Multiple visits by delegations from both countries have promoted the development of bilateral relations.
