	The Advantages of Road Transport
	Wang Derong, Deputy Secretary-General, China Transportation Association

	The position of road transport in China's transportation system mainly depends on the advantages of road transport. This not only refers to the advantages it currently possesses but also to the potential advantages that come with the improvement of road equipment. A large amount of research shows that in the foreseeable future, railways will be the main force for passenger and freight transportation in China; road transport should be the main force for short-distance passenger and freight transportation. It should also undertake a large amount of medium-distance, high-value, time-sensitive industrial product transportation. For some perishable goods or small-batch goods, long-distance transportation over thousands of kilometers is also suitable. With the improvement of road transport technology and equipment, the potential advantages of road transport will be further exploited, and its scope of use will be further expanded. In places without railways or waterways, road transport is naturally the main force. These conclusions are drawn from the advantages of various transportation modes, considering the overall social benefits.

	In recent years, the state has vigorously promoted the diversion of short-distance passenger transport to roads, achieving good results. This work should be further strengthened. Currently, the state has adjusted the passenger fares for railways, which brings new opportunities for road passenger transport. We should seize this opportunity and take effective measures to accelerate the diversion of railway passenger transport to roads. This will play a beneficial role in easing the tight situation of railway transportation.

    公路运输很有优势
    中国交通运输协会副秘书长　王德荣
    公路运输在我国运输体系中的地位，主要取决于公路运输的优势。这不仅指目前已具有的优势，还要注意到公路装备的改善所具有的潜在优势。大量研究表明，在可预见的将来，铁路将是我国客货运输的主力；公路则应该是短途客货运输的主力，它还应大量承担中距离的、高值的、时效强的工业产品的运输，对于一些鲜活易腐货物或小批量货物，上千公里的长距离运输也是合宜的。随着公路技术装备的改善，公路运输潜在优势的发挥，它的使用范围还将进一步扩大。在没有铁路、水运的地方，公路自然是运输的主力。这些结论是根据各种运输方式的优势，从社会整体效益出发得出的。
    近几年来，国家大力开展公路分流短途客运，取得了良好的效果。这项工作还应大力加强。目前国家已对铁路旅客运价做了调整，这对公路客运的发展带来了新的契机，应因势利导，采取有效措施，加快公路分流铁路客运工作。这对缓和铁路运输紧张局面将起到有益的作用。
