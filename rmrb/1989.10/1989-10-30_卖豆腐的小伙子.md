In the early morning, a cool breeze blows. The vegetable market is bustling again.

The square tofu shop window is even more lively, with more than 20 male and female customers lined up, waiting to buy tofu.

The owner of the tofu shop is a young man with a limp, always wearing a smile. The tofu he makes is fine and smooth, not too watery, and both white and tender. Buyers don't have to worry about it being sour or breaking. It is said that a cyclist once had an accident and, in a panic, checked the basket to find that the tofu was all intact and not damaged.

He works efficiently, one hand making tofu and the other holding the scale, as if he has undergone special training. With one scoop, he gets exactly one pound, and then extends the scale for you to see. Then, limping over, he carefully places the tofu into the customer's basket, bowl, or plastic bag.

On the tofu rack hangs his business license framed in a picture frame, and the recently paid tax receipt is inserted on top. He is just over 30 years old, in the prime of his life.

The early customers have finished their purchases, and the housewives who come late will have to wait a bit longer. Taking advantage of this gap, he brings out a few more trays of tofu, covering them with a white cloth.

At this moment, a middle-aged man walks in, immediately asking to buy several trays. The middle-aged man is covered in grease, looking like someone who does resale business.

The young man looks up in surprise: "I won't sell that much."

The middle-aged man immediately takes out a stack of bills: "Add five fen per pound, will you sell it? I'll take it all."

"Then what about the others? They won't be able to buy any."

The middle-aged man shakes his head dismissively: "That's none of my business." Saying this, he starts to move the tofu.

"No, I won't sell it." The young man blocks the hand that reaches out, saying firmly.

"Don't you want to make money in business? Kid!" The middle-aged man is very surprised.

"I do, but I want to make it fairly, I don't want an extra fen."

When he says this, I recall the scene when the tofu shop opened. His many friends came to congratulate him, hoping to eat his good tofu, and the leaders of the labor service company advised him: "Make good tofu, do honest business."

This tofu shop, this business license, and these tofu ingredients, which one is not helped by them?!

In order to let him make good tofu, some old comrades sent him clippings with improved production methods. Now, this disabled young unemployed person has become a famous tofu maker known far and wide. Can he forget all this and be ungrateful for the sake of profit?

The middle-aged man is obviously angry: "I've never seen such a fool!"

He sincerely says: "Comrade, you can buy a few pounds to take home and eat... I do business, and I must learn to be a good person first!"

The middle-aged man glares at him, waves his hand: "Hmph, you can't sell tofu for a lifetime, can you?" Saying this, he walks away angrily.

The young man watches the middle-aged man gradually disappear and smiles, saying: "Everyone welcomes me to make tofu, so I'll make tofu for a lifetime."

Soon, those familiar old customers, carrying baskets, holding plates, and opening plastic bags, walk over with smiles, like welcoming a relative...

### 卖豆腐的小伙子

　　卖豆腐的小伙子
　　马平
    清晨，凉风习习。菜市场又沸腾起来了。
    四四方方的豆腐房窗前显得更是热闹，20多个男女顾客排成一拉溜长队，等着买豆腐。
    豆腐房主人是一个跛脚小伙子，脸上总是挂着笑。他做的豆腐细腻，含水不多，又白又嫩，买者不用担心味酸或破裂。听说有个骑车的在路上不小心摔了一跤，慌忙中拎起篮子一看，嘿，豆腐全好好的没有烂。
    他有条不紊地一手打豆腐，一手提秤，仿佛经过专门训练似的，十分麻利。他一铲下去不多不少正好一斤，同时把秤伸上前来让你亲眼过目，然后拐着脚走过来，小心翼翼地把豆腐放进顾客篮里、碗里或塑料袋内。
    豆腐架子上挂着他用镜框装着的营业执照，刚交的税条子插在上面。他刚过30岁，正是精力旺盛的时候。
    起早的顾客卖完了，姗姗来迟的家庭主妇还要等一会儿才到，趁这空隙，他又搬出了几板豆腐，用白纱巾盖好。
    这时，走来一个中年人，张口就要买十几板。中年人身上油渍麻花，像是个做转手生意的人。
    小伙子吃惊地抬起头来：“这么多我不卖。”
    中年人立即掏出一叠票子：“每斤加伍分，你卖不卖，我全要了。”
      “那别人呢，别人不买了？”
    中年人不以为然晃着头：“那不关我的事。”说着，就要动手搬豆腐。
      “不，我不卖了。”小伙子拦住伸过来的手，斩钉截铁地说。
      “作买卖不想赚钱？小伙子！”中年人很惊奇。
      “想，但要赚得合情合理，多一分我也不要。”
    说这话的时候，我脑海掠过豆腐店开业时的情景，他的许多朋友来祝贺，希望能吃上他做的好豆腐，还有劳动服务公司的领导告诫他：精做豆腐，诚做生意。
    这豆腐房，这营业执照，还有这些豆腐的来料，哪一样不是他们帮着操持的呢！
    为了让他把豆腐做好，有些老同志给他送来改进制作方法的剪报资料。如今，他这个身患残疾的待业青年成了远近闻名的做豆腐能手，难道就可以忘掉这些，见利忘义吗？
    中年人显然是恼怒了：“没见过这样的呆子！”
    他诚恳地说：“同志，你先买几斤回去吃着……我做生意，更要学会先做人！”
    中年人瞪了他一眼，手一甩：“哼，你总不能做一辈子豆腐吧？”说完，气呼呼走了。
    小伙子看看中年人渐渐远去，笑了笑说：“大家欢迎我做豆腐，我就做一辈子。”
    不一会儿，那些天天见的老主顾，正提着篮子，端着盘子，张着塑料袋，像迎接亲人笑眯眯地走了过来……
