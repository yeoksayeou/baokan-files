Title: Between the Mayor and the Citizens

Being a mayor in China is a tough job, and this is a common sentiment among mayors. One mayor created a couplet that reads: "Good deeds, bad deeds, humiliating deeds, all must be done"; "Complaints, curses, praises, all reach the ears." The horizontal scroll reads "Difficult to satisfy everyone." This couplet quickly spread among mayors and to a large extent reflects the current mindset of mayors. Mayors in capitalist countries only handle spending money and do not worry about generating revenue. Chinese mayors have to do both, developing the economy and building the city simultaneously. They face numerous challenges such as population growth, traffic congestion, energy shortages, inflation, housing, environmental pollution, and more. As a citizen, I can somewhat understand this. However, citizens are more concerned about how mayors think and plan to address these challenges. Therefore, when I saw the book "The Mayor's Reflections" (published by Xinhua Publishing House), I was immediately drawn to it and finished reading it in one go on the train from Beijing to Jinan. This is truly a good book! It can prompt both citizens and mayors to reflect together. As Minister Lin Hanxiong of the Ministry of Construction pointed out in the preface, this book not only resonates with mayors but also helps build a bridge of mutual understanding between mayors and citizens. It can stimulate the mayor's thoughts and also inspire the citizens' thoughts, making citizens more understanding and supportive of the mayor's work.

Unity leads to cooperation. This is why I highly value the idea of "citizens and mayors reflecting together." However, when I turned to the last page of the book, I was surprised to find that only 970 copies were printed. Given that we have 443 cities, even if the book is only used to stimulate mayors' thoughts, the print run is too small. As the owners of the cities, citizens will have an even harder time getting their hands on it. The bridge between citizens and mayors should be built to be two-way and wider, so that citizens and mayors can think together and work together. This is probably the path to success for Tianjin. The changes in Tianjin in recent years have caught the attention of foreigners, impressed Chinese people, and made Tianjin residents proud: the 234-kilometer-long Luan River Diversion Project to Tianjin was completed and water was supplied in just 16 months, ending the history of Tianjin residents drinking salty water; the 34-kilometer-long Middle Ring Road with 7 bridges and 9 interchanges was completed and opened to traffic in just 10 months; during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, 17.12 million square meters of new housing were built, equivalent to the total housing built in the 31 years since liberation, increasing the per capita housing area by 5 square meters; the 7.4-kilometer-long first phase of the underground railway was completed and opened to traffic in less than a year; the largest sewage treatment plant in the country was completed and put into use in just two years; during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, Tianjin's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 67.7%, and national income increased by 51%, which is the most significant in history. People from other cities and foreigners who visit Tianjin also find three "strange things" that baffle them: first, in the face of the universally recognized difficulty of demolishing old buildings, Tianjin residents actively cooperate; second, in the face of financial difficulties, Tianjin raises funds from various sources to complete a series of major projects; third, in the face of the increasing trend of materialism, Tianjin residents actively participate in city-wide voluntary labor, truly united in spirit and effort. Therefore, the then mayor Li Ruihuan often told visiting reporters: "The people of Tianjin are truly great." A few years ago, Guangzhou's "Yan Cheng Evening News" launched a "If I Were the Mayor" essay contest, which heard many citizens' thoughtful and practical reflections and suggestions, promoting Guangzhou's urban construction. Based on this, I suggest that relevant authorities consider publishing a book titled "The Citizens' Reflections," investigating and collecting various citizens' reflections and suggestions on the present and future, to complement "The Mayor's Reflections." Reading them together would be both interesting and beneficial.

### 在市长和市民之间

　　在市长和市民之间
　　顾孟潮
    中国的“市长难当”，几乎是所有市长的共同感受。有位市长做了一幅对联，上联是“好事、孬事、窝囊事，事事都干”；下联是“怨声、骂声、赞扬声，声声入耳”，横批是“难如人意”。这幅对联很快就在市长中传开了，在相当程度上道出了目前市长们的心态。资本主义国家的市长只管“花钱”不管生财；中国的市长是“花钱”、
  “生财”一肩挑，发展经济、建设城市同步走，面临着人口、交通、能源、物价、住房、环境污染……一个又一个难题岂能不难。作为一个市民，我也是可想而知一二的。但是市民们更关心的是市长们面对种种难题是如何思索又准备采取何种对策？因此，一见《市长的思索》（新华出版社）这一书名，便吸引了我，禁不住在北京赴济南的火车上一口气把它读完。这真是一本好书！它可以促使市民和市长们共思索。正如建设部林汉雄部长在前言所指出的，这不仅可引起市长们的共鸣，更便于架起市长和市民之间双向理解的桥梁。不仅可以引发市长的思索，也将引起市民的思索，促使市民更加理解和支持市长的工作。
    同心才能协力。这便是我十分重视“市民和市长共思索”的原因。然而，当我翻到书的最后一页时吃惊地发现，该书仅印了970册。要知道我们有443个城市，即使把它仅作为“引发市长思索”的材料，这个印数也是太少了。作为城市主人的市民，该更难读到它了。似应把市民和市长之间的桥梁架设成双向的，更宽畅的，使市民和市长心往一处想，劲往一处使。这大概就是天津的成功之路吧？天津市近几年的变化，使外国人瞩目，使中国人叹服，使天津人自豪：全长234公里的引滦入津工程，仅用了16个月就竣工通水，结束了天津市民喝咸水的历史；全长34公里、带7座桥梁和9座立交的中环线，只用10个月建成贯通了；“六五”期间共新建住宅1712万平方米，等于解放31年建房总和，使人均住房增加5平方米；长7.4公里的地下铁路第一期工程，不到一年时间就竣工通车了；全国最大的污水处理厂，只建了两年就投入使用；“六五”期间，天津的工农业总产值增长67.7％，国民收入增长51％，在历史上是最突出的。外市人、外国人去天津参观，也觉得有三件“怪事”使他们困惑不解：一是面对当今世界公认的旧房拆迁难题，天津市民主动配合；二是面对地方财政紧张的困难，天津多方筹资完成了一系列浩大工程；三是面对一些人的拜金主义之风大有愈刮愈烈之势的时候，天津人积极参加全市性义务劳动，真是心齐劲足。因此，当时的市长李瑞环多次对来访记者说：“天津的老百姓太好了。”记得前几年，广州的《羊城晚报》曾发起过一次“如果我是市长”为题的征文，因此听到了许多市民精采又实在的思索和建议，对广州的城市建设不无促进。据此，我建议有关方面，是否可以出一本《市民的思索》的书，调查和收集各类市民对目前和未来的思索和建议，与《市长的思索》成姊妹篇，互相参照阅读将是既有趣又有益的事。
