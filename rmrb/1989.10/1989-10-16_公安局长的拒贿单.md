In the Public Security Bureau of Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, whenever someone mentions Wang Xuexi, the bureau's deputy chief who was awarded the title of "National Excellent Public Security Bureau Chief," Liu, the bureau's clerk, would take out a slip of paper and say, "Almost all of our chief's deeds are recorded on this piece of paper!"

This is a list of refused bribes. It briefly records the instances where Wang Xuexi refused to accept bribes and gifts since 1987. Over the years, Wang Xuexi has refused bribes 23 times, declining a total of over 12,000 yuan in gifts and bribes. Seeing this list, the image of a Communist Party member who stands firm against the wind of bribery and gift-giving immediately comes to mind.

One morning, a woman in her thirties came to Wang Xuexi's home. She handed a letter to Wang's wife and said, "Please give this letter to Director Wang." Then she hurried away. Wang Xuexi took the bulky envelope from his wife and immediately sensed something was amiss. He quickly chased after the woman but she had already gone far. Wang opened the envelope and found a letter from a company manager seeking favor, along with 1,000 yuan in cash. It turned out that the manager's son had been detained for hooliganism, and he hoped to use money to persuade Wang to "show mercy," so his son could avoid legal punishment. However, the manager miscalculated. A few days later, Wang returned the envelope containing the 1,000 yuan unopened. His son, who had committed a crime, also received the appropriate legal punishment.

A young driver from Wang Xuexi's hometown wanted to transfer to the Public Security Bureau to become a traffic police officer. One afternoon, he came to Wang's home when Wang was not there and left a letter with Wang's daughter, saying, "I am a friend of your father. Please give this letter to him." When Wang returned home in the evening and opened the envelope, he found no letter but 500 yuan in cash. From his daughter's description of the man, Wang quickly understood the situation.

The next day, Wang asked a colleague to return the 500 yuan to the driver and said, "Please tell him that because of his actions, he cannot work in the public security agency!"

One night, a private school teacher knocked on Wang Xuexi's door for the third time. This private school teacher was originally a formal state-employed teacher but was sent to the countryside in the early 1960s. He came to see Wang to ask for help in changing his rural household registration to an urban one. When he first came to Wang's home, he took out 1,000 yuan and said, "This money is for you to help me with my affairs." Wang immediately refused sternly, "Your household registration issue will be resolved as long as the policy allows. If the policy does not allow it, no amount of money will solve the problem!" He immediately told him to take the money back.

Soon, the public security agency, according to policy regulations, resolved the private school teacher's household registration issue. Afterwards, he emotionally told Wang, "It seems that your bureau's practices are upright!"

    公安局长的拒贿单
    蒋志敏
    在安徽省涡阳县公安局，只要你提起荣获“全国优秀公安局长”称号的王学习，局里的刘干事就会拿出一张单子说：“我们局长的事迹，差不多都记在这上面哩！”
    这是一张拒贿单。上面简要地记录了王学习从1987年以来拒绝接受行贿、送礼的情况。几年来，王学习先后拒贿23次，拒受的礼、贿款达12000多元。看着这张单子，一个在行贿送礼风面前岿然不动的共产党员形象，顿时矗立眼前。
    一天清晨，一名30多岁的女工来到王学习家，拿出一封信对王学习的爱人说：“请把这封信交给王局长。”说罢，匆匆而去。王学习从爱人手里接过这封鼓鼓囊囊的信，顿感有问题，连忙追出门外，但来人已走远。王学习拆开信封，发现是某公司经理写给他的求情信，里面还夹着1000元现金。原来，这位经理的儿子因流氓滋扰被公安局拘留，他想通过送钱说情的办法请王学习“高抬贵手”，使其儿子免受法律制裁。然而，这位经理打错了算盘，几天后，那个装着1000元钱的信封被王学习原封不动地退回。他的犯了罪的儿子也受到应有的法律处罚。
    王学习家乡有个年轻司机，想调到公安局当交通警察。一天下午，他趁王学习不在家时来到王家，把一封信丢给王学习的女儿，并对她说：“我是你爸爸的朋友，请把这封信交给你爸。”晚上归来的王学习拆开信封，发现里面没有信，却装着500元钞票。他从女儿描述那个来人的形象中，很快明白了事情的原委。
    第二天，王学习托一位同志设法将这500元退给那个司机，并说：“请你转告他，就凭他这种做法，就不能进公安机关工作！”
    一天夜晚，一位民办教师第三次敲开了王学习家的门。这位民办教师原是国家正式教师，60年代初被下放到农村。他来找王学习的目的，是想请王学习帮助他解决“农转非”户口问题。当他第一次来到王学习家时，掏出1000元对王学习说：“这笔钱交给你，请你给我帮忙办事时用。”王学习当即严词拒绝：“你的户口问题，只要政策许可，坚决解决。要是政策不许可，钱再多也不解决问题！”当即让他把钱拿回去。
    不久，公安机关根据政策规定，解决了那位民办教师的户口问题。事后，他感动地对王学习说：“看来还是你们的风气正啊！”
