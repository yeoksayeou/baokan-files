The collection of military essays "Zhu Yu Military Writings" has recently been published by the PLA Press. The collection includes 150 articles, most of which are being published for the first time.

The first provincial-level comprehensive science and technology volume "Shanxi Science and Technology Records," compiled by the Shanxi Provincial Science and Technology Commission over four years, has been published by Shanxi Science and Education Press. The book is divided into ten sections and fifty-six chapters, with 200 illustrations and a total of 1.9 million words.

The first volume of the "Jilin Ula Archives Collection: Manchu Genealogy Edition," titled "Jilin Tala Family Genealogy," compiled by the Jilin City Archives and published by the Chinese Social Sciences Press, had its first release ceremony recently in Beijing.

The first national environmental photography exhibition, jointly organized by the State Environmental Protection Administration, Laizhou City Government, and other units, opened on October 25 at the National Art Museum of China. Chi Haotian and Wang Shudao cut the ribbon for the opening ceremony, attended by 300 people from the cultural and news circles of the capital and photography enthusiasts.

The longest television series in China to date, "Liao Zhai" (totaling 60 episodes in 80 parts), has completed 40 episodes and 60 parts. Thus, the pledge made two years ago by Fujian Television and the Nanchang Film and Television Creation Research Institute to produce a "small station producing a large series" is no longer an empty promise like the "new Liao Zhai," but a reality that is within reach.

The China Children and Youth Activity Center and the Taiwan Children's Daily Newspaper jointly organized the first cross-strait children's painting competition with the theme "Draw My Hometown." Children's works from the mainland will be initially selected by local youth palaces and then mailed to the Literature Department of the China Children and Youth Activity Center in Beijing. The deadline for submissions is December 31, 1989.

The national academic conference on "Fudong Wisdom" was recently held in Kashgar, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. "Fudong Wisdom" is an epic poem written by the 11th-century Uyghur thinker, philosopher, and poet Yusuf Khass Hajib.
