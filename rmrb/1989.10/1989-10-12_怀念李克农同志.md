Comrade Li Kenong was an outstanding revolutionary of the proletariat. After the founding of New China, he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for only a little over five years, but his brilliant achievements are unforgettable.

Comrade Li Kenong was appointed as the first Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of New China. Under the direct leadership of Premier Zhou Enlai, who also served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he played a significant role in establishing the organizational structure of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the appointment of personnel, in the political and ideological work of the institution, and in the establishment of other work systems.

This year marks the 90th anniversary of Comrade Li Kenong's birth. To commemorate this old revolutionary who made outstanding contributions to the foreign affairs of New China, we, who worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its early days, have written this commemorative article.

Establishing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

After the founding of New China, Comrade Li Kenong, under the leadership of Premier Zhou, was responsible for the establishment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He personally planned and executed the setting up of the organizational structure, the appointment of key personnel, and the establishment of the political and ideological work system of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He even personally established the system for confidential communications and liaison work, which gradually put the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the right track. At that time, foreign affairs personnel came from five different backgrounds (military cadres, the Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the North China Government, underground party workers, and united front workers), each with different characteristics. How to strengthen the mutual learning and complementation between old and new cadres, workers, and intellectual cadres was a very important issue. To do this work well, he emphasized that political and ideological work must be strengthened first to build a cadre team. In 1950, he led the rectification and cadre review work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From September to December, he gave three reports, emphasizing "rectifying work, not people," "rectifying within the party, not outside the party," and "rectifying from the top, not the bottom." He focused on checking leadership style, work relationships, and the protection of state secrets, calling on leading cadres to listen more to the opinions of the masses and to conduct self-criticism. In the first half of 1951, he led the cadre review work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Based on democratic appraisal and the Three-Anti Campaign, he called for honesty and frankness, for confessing history, and for the principle of "saying as much as you know, not pursuing or pressuring," relying on materials to seek truth from facts. This did not harm the cadres, and the cadre review work achieved great success. Later, he focused on checking the problems in documents and telegrams, improving the quality and efficiency of work. Through rectification, cadre review, and correcting the shortcomings in documents and telegrams, the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs underwent a tremendous change. He once made a special report to Premier Zhou about this, which was praised by Premier Zhou.

According to Chairman Mao's instruction to "start anew," the organizational structure of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was newly established and did not follow the old foreign affairs institutions and personnel of the Kuomintang. However, Comrade Li Kenong believed that there were still some foreign affairs personnel in the country who had worked in the Kuomintang foreign affairs institutions. They had professional knowledge and were proficient in foreign languages. Except for those who were firmly reactionary, they should be educated and reformed and absorbed to engage in foreign affairs work. His opinion was agreed to by Premier Zhou. Later, these personnel who were absorbed into the work all made beneficial contributions and played an active role in foreign affairs work.

On March 15, 1954, at the expanded meeting of the Party Group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, discussing the study of the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he proposed, in combination with the actual situation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, six principles for the political life of the Party Group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: 1. Unity above all; 2. Establish the authority of the Central Committee; 3. Strengthen collective leadership; 4. Report to the Central Committee and Chairman Mao on any problems; 5. Check your own shortcomings; 6. Carry out mutual criticism. The attendees fully agreed with these six principles. These six principles played a very important role in strengthening the leadership and unity of the Party Group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Leading the Korean Armistice Talks

The Korean Armistice Talks were the most important diplomatic struggle in the early days of the founding of New China. On June 3, 1951, Premier Kim Il-sung came to Beijing to discuss with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai the policies and strategies for the Korean Armistice Talks. On July 1, Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai jointly replied to the commander of the United Nations forces, General Ridgway, agreeing to hold armistice talks. Subsequently, the two parties decided to send Comrade Li Kenong to the front line to lead the talks. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement was the first great victory of New China's diplomacy. Comrade Li Kenong led this work from beginning to end. Premier Zhou once personally wrote a letter to him, saying that the Central Committee affirmed the achievements of the delegation.

The Korean Armistice Talks began on July 10, 1951, and ended with the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953. The talks on the Chinese and North Korean sides were conducted under the leadership of Comrade Li Kenong from beginning to end, but he did not appear in the talks, so many people did not know his role. In fact, the policies and specific negotiating strategies of the highest leaders of China and North Korea were all implemented by him. On some key issues, he studied and thought carefully and once made important suggestions to the highest leaders of China and North Korea, which were agreed to. At that time, the North Korean People's Army delegation and the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation cooperated closely, with the North Korean People's Army delegation taking the lead in negotiations with the United States. The Volunteers delegation established a Party committee, with Li Kenong as the secretary, Deng Hua, Jie Fang, and Qiao Guanhua as members.

When they first arrived in Korea, the Volunteers delegation had no more than 60 people. After a year, it expanded to 700 people, and later to more than 2,000 people, with 28 work departments. If the personnel of the prisoner-of-war repatriation committee on our side were added, there were more than 7,000 people, which was a very large organization. He worked in Kaesong (later in Panmunjom) for two years and four months. In the early days, the living conditions were very harsh, with poor accommodation and supply conditions. At night, they could only use kerosene lamps for lighting, and everyone crowded together, making life very inconvenient. American planes also frequently bombed and strafed the delegation's residence. Once, a bullet even hit Comrade Li Kenong's jeep, but he remained calm and led the entire delegation to quickly evacuate. At that time, he often had heart problems and poor eyesight, while the struggle was extremely complex and sharp. Under such difficult conditions, he worked despite his illness, with astonishing willpower and revolutionary optimism, leading the entire delegation to work selflessly. He shared the same hardships with everyone, with a high sense of vigilance and rich experience in struggle against the enemy, arranging work details and contingency measures properly, often having intimate talks with comrades, playing a role in inspiring the morale and perseverance of the struggle. At that time, the United States always wanted to use military pressure to support their negotiators, and every move on the front line was reflected on the negotiating table. When encountering such situations, Comrade Li Kenong always instructed our negotiators to stand firm and not let the United States obtain on the negotiating table what they could not get on the battlefield.

Later, his asthma worsened and became more severe. The Central Committee was concerned that he might not be able to endure it and decided to send Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Xiuquan to Korea to replace him, allowing him to return to the country for treatment and rest. Li Kenong, however, considered that although his health was not good, he was already familiar with the entire situation of foreign negotiations, had understood the rules of all aspects, and if he were replaced midway, everything would have to start from scratch, which would not be beneficial to the overall work. He advocated "not changing the commander in the midst of battle" and suggested that as long as his body could still endure, he should not be replaced immediately. His suggestion was reported to the Central Committee, and the Central Committee agreed that he should continue to lead the negotiations. His spirit of not caring for personal safety, working despite illness, and fighting tenaciously without leaving the front line greatly inspired the morale of the entire delegation.

During his work in Korea, he set an example, greatly respecting the Korean comrades, strengthening the close unity between China and Korea with an internationalist spirit and a sincere attitude, and always educating the cadres with internationalism. He emphasized that the Korean people are a heroic nation, that the Korean state is a young and promising country, that Korea is a neighboring country that has shared weal and woe with China, and that the Korean people are diligent, simple, and kind. He required that the spirit of treating Korean affairs as one's own, loving every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea, and not taking a needle and thread from the Korean people should be strictly implemented by all members of the delegation. During his work in Korea, he not only studied the situation and grasped the policies but also personally dealt with the logistics supply, smooth communication of confidential matters, selection, appointment, and training of cadres, and the development of ideological and political work of the delegation. Whether it was external struggles or internal work order issues, he grasped them tightly and specifically. Due to his leadership, a temporary group of cadres from all directions was able to unite and fight together in such a complex and sharp struggle, completing the tasks assigned by the Central Committee excellently.

Participating in the Geneva Conference

Considering Comrade Li Kenong's experience in Korea, he was designated as a member of the Chinese delegation to the 1954 Geneva Conference, with Premier Zhou Enlai as the head of the delegation (the other two members were Zhang Wentian and Wang Rongsheng). He was first responsible for the composition of the delegation, the selection of cadres, the collection of materials, and other preparatory work. The formal conference was from April 26 to July 21.

The Geneva Conference was the first major international conference attended by China, discussing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. The participants included not only the major Western countries at the time (the United States, Britain, France, and Canada) but also the major socialist countries (the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Poland), and the nationalist countries (India, Thailand, Burma, Laos, Cambodia). The situation was more complex and the tasks were more arduous than the Korean negotiations. To do this work well, Comrade Li Kenong gave two reports to the entire delegation in early April. The first report specifically discussed the work attitude, policy, and discipline, stressing that we should be vigilant against Western countries, conduct struggles with reason, benefit, and moderation; avoid great-power chauvinism towards brotherly countries, be warm and sincere in attitude, faithfully reflect the situation, ensure organizational independence, and adopt a consultative attitude towards various issues. We should respect nationalist countries and strive for their support or neutrality. The second report specifically discussed the situation, policies, and estimates of the conference. Comrade Li Kenong participated in the entire conference from beginning to end. From June 23 to July 12, during the period when Premier Zhou Enlai left Geneva, he presided over the work of the delegation (Zhang Wentian and Wang Rongsheng had left earlier), representing Premier Zhou to attend the conference.

After the conference, he gave a brilliant report to the cadres of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, summarizing the work of the Geneva Conference. He said that the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the ceasefire in Indochina, adhering to the following principles: the principle of peaceful reunification; the principle of recognizing the independence of all nations and non-interference in internal affairs; the principle of collective security and collective guarantee; the principle that Indochina should not be used as a military base by foreign countries and should not join any military alliance. Regarding the struggle with imperialist countries, he talked about the following strategies: not rushing or breaking off (not rushing the other side, not breaking off negotiations); not taking big steps, nor stopping small steps; seeking common ground while reserving differences; solving some small problems to arouse the other side's interest; adopting a mild and reasonable attitude. Regarding cooperation with socialist countries, he mentioned the following points: respecting the Soviet Union, which has more experience in diplomacy than other countries; communicating more, maintaining more contact, introducing more situations, and actively helping to solve some problems; sincerely helping Korea and Vietnam, preventing patronage; generally respecting the countries involved in minor issues, and reporting to the Central Committee for major issues that cannot be decided. He also proposed several main experiences of participating in the Geneva Conference: combining principles with flexibility, fully utilizing the contradictions among imperialist countries, respecting neighboring small countries, being good at seizing the opportunity to propose several suggestions that do not harm the principles, and the working method of seeking common ground while reserving differences.

Admirable and Respectable Work Style

Comrade Li Kenong's work style is very touching. Anyone who has come into contact with him has left a very deep impression. Here are a few main points.

In doing political and ideological work, he emphasized both personal example and verbal instruction. Whether in Beijing, Kaesong, or Geneva, Li Kenong always led by example, working diligently and selflessly, never shifting blame or taking credit. He emphasized the importance of discipline and institutional adherence, believing that this should start with the leading cadres and then be implemented by everyone, with no exceptions. He often told us that one must first correct oneself before correcting others, and if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked. Wherever he went, he practiced what he preached. He was principled and often told cadres that if our work is successful, it is not because of us but because of the party. The party has achievements, and we have a share in them, but the main credit goes to the party. In various meetings, the strict requirements he placed on cadres, he himself always met first, which made his speeches very convincing and extremely vivid. His reports were always drafted by himself, rarely delegating to others. Those who have heard him give reports always feel that he is deeply involved in life, has a clear purpose, and is full of passion, often being attracted by his enthusiasm.

In dealing with cadres, he was both strict in his requirements and caring and loving. Those who have worked under his leadership know that his requirements for cadres are very strict, never overlooking any shortcomings or mistakes he finds, but he also cares for and loves cadres very much. In the early 1950s, some envoys had just started their diplomatic work and made inappropriate statements. One ambassador had a great-power chauvinist mentality and was criticized by the Central Committee. He said that for his mistakes, criticism should be strict, but organizational handling should be lenient. This spirit of loving people with virtue is very touching. He often told us that although you are just starting diplomatic work, it is led by the Chairman and Premier. As long as you report more and do not take things lightly, big problems will not arise. As long as you have the initiative to work, you will have creativity, and you should not be tied down.

He placed great trust in cadres, allowing them to develop their skills through practical experience. He believed that those selected for frontline work should have the authority to independently carry out work according to the central policies and handle problems they encounter, without interference from others. During his work in Kaesong, some comrades who directly participated in negotiations and other external work were intellectuals who had returned from studying abroad to join the revolutionary work. Comrade Li Kenong explained various policies, guidelines, and systems to them and then let them gain experience through practical struggles. These comrades made rapid progress, and their work in all aspects was very outstanding. He reported these situations to Premier Zhou and suggested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should plan to rotate cadres with Kaesong because cultivating and testing cadres in practical struggles is the best, fastest, and most effective method. The fighting environment is different from the normal environment, and due to the pressure of the environment, there is nothing to rely on, so one must fully tap into one's potential. Premier Zhou fully agreed with his opinion.

In understanding the situation of cadres, he did not rely solely on files but had direct conversations to understand their real performance. In the early days of the establishment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he personally met with major foreign affairs officials who had returned from abroad to report on their work (sometimes even including low-level foreign affairs officials) and seriously understood the situation, directly solving problems. For high-level cadres with ideological problems, he also talked to them repeatedly, understanding their true thoughts and helping to solve problems. For the situation of leading cadres, in addition to conducting investigations and understanding through the organizational system, he also paid great attention to directly talking with lower-level cadres to understand the situation of leading cadres and combining the two. Therefore, his understanding of cadres was more comprehensive, and his handling of cadre issues was more fair.

He was upright and incorruptible, dedicated to public service, and opposed extravagance, waste, and other unhealthy trends. For example, in the early days of liberation, some old cadres abandoned their revolutionary comrades who had shared hardships with them and found younger partners. He was very displeased with this and once told his comrades that this was a lack of revolutionary morality. While he himself practiced what he preached, his wife had no education and had bound feet, but he did not despise her and shared hardships with her for a long time. His children also respected their mother very much, and the family relationship was very harmonious. His wife passed away first, and he often took his children to the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery at Baobao Mountain to pay their respects. For his four children, he wanted them to make their own way and not rely on their father as a backer. From this, it can also be seen how he correctly treated his family members and children.

Comrade Li Kenong has been away from us for more than 20 years. Recalling these past events, it is as if his venerable and benevolent face appears before us again, and his touching words give us another profound education. Reviewing his words and teachings is to deeply commemorate him and once again draw profound lessons from his example.

    怀念李克农同志
    耿飚　黄镇　王幼平　韩念龙　何英　郑为之
    李克农同志是一位杰出的无产阶级革命家。新中国成立后，他在外交部只工作了5年多，但他的光辉业绩是令人难忘的。
    李克农同志是新中国刚成立时被任命的第一任外交部常务副部长。他在周恩来总理兼外交部长的直接领导下，对于外交部机构的建立，干部、人事的配备、机关的政治思想工作制度以及其他工作制度的确立，起了重大的作用。
    今年是李克农同志诞生90周年，为了纪念这位对新中国外交有杰出贡献的老战士，我们这些早期在外交部工作的同志写了这篇纪念文章。
    筹建外交部机关
    新中国成立后，李克农同志在周总理的领导下负责外交部的筹建工作，举凡机构的设置，重要人员配备和外交部政治思想工作制度的建立，特别是部领导集体办公制度和部内各单位职权划分的规定，都是由他亲自筹划办理的，甚至机要通讯联络工作系统，也是由他亲手建立起来的，这就使外交部的机关工作逐步走上正轨。当时外交干部来自5个方面（军队干部、中共中央外事组、华北政府、地下党工作者、统战工作者），各有不同特点，如何加强新老干部、工农干部和知识分子干部相互学习，取长补短，是一个很重要的问题。为了做好这项工作，他强调首先要抓好政治思想工作，加强干部队伍的建设。1950年他领导外交部整风、整干委员会的工作。从9月到12月，他前后做了3次报告，强调“整工作不整个人”、“整党内不整党外”、“整上不整下”，着重检查领导作风、工作关系和保守国家机密，号召领导干部多听群众意见，并带头进行自我检查。1951年上半年，他领导外交部审查干部的工作，在民主鉴定、联系三大运动的基础上，号召忠诚坦白、交代历史，贯彻说多少、算多少，不追不逼，依靠材料办事的实事求是方针，没有伤害干部，审干工作取得了很大成绩。后来，他又集中力量检查文件、电报中存在的问题，提高了文电质量和工作效率。经过整风、审干和纠正文电缺点等方面的工作，外交部机关工作面貌日新月异。他曾就此专门向周总理做了报告，得到周总理的称赞。
    按照毛主席“另起炉灶”的指示，外交部的机构是重新建立的，没有沿用国民党的旧外交机构和留用国民党外交人员。但李克农同志认为，国内还有一些曾在国民党外交机关工作过的外交人员，他们具有专业知识并通晓外语，除了坚决反动的以外，应该加以教育改造，吸收他们从事外交工作。他的意见得到周总理的同意。后来被吸收参加工作的这些人员在外交工作中都做了有益的工作，起了积极的作用。
    1954年3月15日，在外交部党组扩大会上谈学习七届四中全会文件时，他结合外交部的实际，提出了外交部党组政治生活的六项准则：1、团结高于一切；2、树立中央威信；3、加强集体领导；4、有问题向党中央和毛主席请示；5、检查自己的缺点；6、相互展开批评。与会同志完全同意他提出的这六条准则。这六条准则对于加强外交部党组的领导和团结起了十分重要的作用。领导朝鲜停战谈判
    朝鲜停战谈判是新中国建立初期最重要的外交斗争。1951年6月3日，金日成首相到北京同毛泽东主席、周恩来总理商谈有关朝鲜停战谈判的方针和对策。7月1日金日成、彭德怀联名签复联合国军总司令李奇微，同意举行停战谈判。随后，两党商定派李克农同志亲临斗争第一线，主持谈判工作。朝鲜停战谈判达成协议，是新中国外交的第一个伟大胜利。李克农同志从头至尾在第一线领导了这项工作。周总理曾经亲自写信给他，说党中央肯定代表团的工作成绩。
    朝鲜停战谈判从1951年7月10日开始，到1953年7月27日朝鲜停战协定签字，中朝方面的谈判工作自始自终是在李克农同志主持下进行的，但他并没有出面谈判，因此他的作用许多人并不知道。其实，中、朝最高领导的方针、政策和具体谈判策略都是经过他贯彻执行的。在某些关键问题上，他认真研究思考，曾向朝中最高领导提出重要建议并得到同意。当时朝鲜人民军代表团和中国人民志愿军代表团亲密合作，对美谈判以朝鲜人民军代表团为主。志愿军代表团成立了党委，李克农任书记，邓华、解方、乔冠华为委员。
    刚到朝鲜时，志愿军谈判代表团总共不超过60人，过了一年，扩大到700人，后来又扩大到2000余人，有28个工作部门，如果加上战俘遣返委员会我方工作人员，总共有7000余人，是一个很大的摊子。他在开城（后在板门店）工作两年零4个月。初期生活非常艰苦，居住、供应条件都很差，晚上只能用煤油灯照明，大家挤在一起，生活很不方便。美国飞机还不断对代表团驻地轰炸和扫射。有一次，子弹甚至打到克农同志的吉普车上，但他沉着镇定，带领全团同志迅速转移。当时他心脏病有时发作，眼睛又不好，而斗争又异常复杂和尖锐。在这样困难的条件下，他带病坚持工作，以惊人的毅力和革命乐观主义的精神，领导全团同志忘我地进行工作。他同大家同甘共苦，以高度的敌情观念和丰富的对敌斗争经验，妥善安排工作细节和应变措施，经常和同志们亲切谈话，起了鼓舞人心、坚持斗争的作用。当时美国总是想通过军事压力来为他们的谈判代表撑腰，前线上的一举一动无不反映到谈判桌上来。遇到这种情况，李克农同志总是教导我们的谈判代表要硬着头皮顶住，决不让美国在谈判桌上得到战场上得不到的东西。
    后来，他的哮喘病复发并且越来越严重，党中央担心他身体支持不住，决定派外交部副部长伍修权到朝鲜去替换他，让他回国治疗和休养。李克农却考虑，他虽然身体不太好，但已熟悉了对外谈判的全部情况，摸清了各方面的规律，如果中途换人，一切又得从头做起，对整个工作不太有利。他主张“临阵不换将”，建议在他身体还可以支持的情况下，不马上换人。他的建议上报中央，中央同意仍然由他负责领导谈判工作。他这种不顾个人安危、带病坚持岗位、顽强战斗、不下火线的精神，大大鼓舞了全团同志的斗志。
    他在朝鲜工作期间，以身作则，十分尊重朝鲜同志，用国际主义精神和诚恳态度加强中朝亲密团结，并时时以国际主义教育干部。他强调指出，朝鲜民族是一个英雄的民族，朝鲜国家是一个年青有为的国家，朝鲜是同中国患难与共血肉相凝的邻邦，朝鲜人民是勤劳、朴素、善良的人民，要坚决贯彻毛主席讲的，必须把朝鲜的事情看作自己的事情一样，爱护朝鲜一山一水、一草一木，不拿朝鲜人民一针一线的精神，要求全团工作人员切实做到这一点。他在朝鲜工作期间，不仅研究形势，掌握政策，还亲自过问代表团后勤的供应、机要联络的畅通，干部的选用、任命和培养以及思想政治工作的开展。无论从对外斗争到内部工作秩序问题，他都抓得紧，抓得具体细致。由于他的领导，才使得一个临时由四面八方调集一起的各种类型的干部，在那样复杂、尖锐的斗争中，能够团结在一起，战斗在一起，出色地完成了党中央交付的任务。
    参加日内瓦会议
    考虑到李克农同志在朝鲜工作的经验，他被指定为由周总理为团长的1954年日内瓦会议中国代表团团员（其他二名是张闻天和王稼祥）。他首先负责代表团的组成、挑选干部、收集资料等各项准备工作。正式会议是4月26日到7月21日。
    日内瓦会议是我国第一次参加的大型重要国际会议，讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题，与会者不仅有当时的主要西方国家（美、英、法、加拿大），也有当时的主要社会主义国家（苏、中、朝、越、波兰）和当时的民族主义国家（印度、泰国、缅甸、老挝、柬埔寨），情况比朝鲜谈判更加复杂，任务更加艰巨。为了做好这项工作，李克农同志4月初就先后向代表团全体工作人员做了两次报告，第一次专门讲工作态度、方针和纪律，对西方国家要提高警惕，有理有利有节地进行斗争；对兄弟国家要避免大国主义，态度要热情和真诚，要忠实反映情况，保证组织上独立，对各类问题要采取协商态度。要尊重民族主义国家，争取它们的支持或中立。第二次专门讲形势和政策以及对会议的估计。李克农同志从头至尾参加了这次国际会议，在6月23日至7月12日代表团团长周总理离开日内瓦期间，由他主持代表团工作（张闻天、王稼祥已先期离去），代表周总理出席会议。
    会议结束以后，他向外交部干部做了一个精彩的报告，总结了日内瓦会议的工作。他说日内瓦会议达成了印度支那停火的协议是遵循了以下原则：和平统一原则；承认各民族独立与不干涉各国内政原则；集体安全与集体保证原则；印度支那不作为外国军事基地、不参加任何军事同盟原则。关于同帝国主义国家的斗争，他谈到以下策略：不急不断（不急催对方，不中断谈判）；不跨大步，也不停小步；求同存异；要解决一些小问题，引起对方兴趣；采取温和说理态度。关于同社会主义国家的合作，他说到以下各点：要尊重苏联，在外交上它比其他国家有经验；多通气、勤联系，多介绍情况，主动帮助解决一些问题；真诚地帮助朝鲜和越南，防止包办代替；一般问题尊重当事国，重大问题不能决定时报告中央。他还提出了参加日内瓦会议几条主要经验：原则性与灵活性结合、充分利用帝国主义国家的矛盾、尊重邻近小国、善于掌握时机，提出若干不损害原则的建议以及求同存异的工作方法。
    令人怀念和敬佩的工作作风
    李克农同志的工作作风是十分感人的，凡是和他接触过的人，都留下极为深刻的印象。这里主要谈以下几点。
    做政治思想工作，身教和言教并重。不论在北京、开城和日内瓦工作期间，李克农都是自己带头做出表率，勤勤恳恳，忘我地工作，从不诿过，不居功，他强调遵守纪律和遵守制度，并且认为这首先要从领导干部做起，然后才能贯彻执行，任何人都不能例外。他经常对我们说，先正己，才能正人，上梁不正，下梁歪。无论到哪里，他都身体力行。他党性强，经常对干部说，我们工作做好了，不是我们好而是党好。党有成绩，其中有我们的一份，但主要是党的功绩。他在各种会议上对干部提出的严格要求他自己总是首先做到的，这就使他的讲话有极大的说服力，而且讲得极为生动。他的报告稿总是亲自草拟，极少假手于人。听过他做报告的人，总觉得他深入生活，有针对性，并有血有肉，往往被他的激情所吸引。
    对待干部既严格要求，又关怀爱护。凡是在他领导下工作过的人，都知道他对干部的要求是极为严格的，从不放过他所发现的任何缺点和错误，但他对干部又极为关怀和爱护。五十年代初期，有些使节刚从事外交工作，对外表态时有不妥之处。一位大使有大国主义情绪，受到中央的批评。他说，对其错误，批评从严，但组织处理要从宽。这种爱人以德的精神是非常感人的。他经常对我们说，虽然你们刚做外交工作，但外交工作是主席、总理领导的，只要多请示报告，不掉以轻心，大问题出不了。只要有工作积极性，就会有创造性，不要束手束脚。
    放手使用干部，让他们在实际锻炼中增长才干。疑人不用，用人不疑。他一向认为，凡是选定在第一线工作的人，应该有权根据中央的既定方针政策独立地进行工作，全权处理自己遇到的问题，别人不要干涉。在开城工作期间，有些直接参加谈判和其他对外工作的同志是从外国留学回来参加革命工作的知识分子。李克农同志向他们交代各项方针政策制度后，放手让他们在实际斗争中锻炼。这些同志进步很快，各方面的工作都做得非常出色。他曾向周总理报告了这些情况并建议外交部有计划同开城轮换干部，因为在实际斗争中培养和考验干部，是最好最快、最有效的办法，战斗环境同正常环境不同，由于环境所逼，无可依赖，只有充分发挥自己的潜在力量。周总理完全同意他的意见。
    了解干部情况，不能光靠档案，要亲自对话，了解现实表现。在外交部建部初期，从国外回来述职的主要外交官（有时甚至还包括低级外交官），他都是亲自接见，认真了解情况，直接解决问题。部里高级干部有思想问题，他也是不厌其烦地多次谈话，了解其真实思想，帮助解决问题。对于领导干部的情况，他除了按组织系统进行考察了解以外，还非常注意直接找下面干部谈话，了解领导干部的情况，并把两者结合起来。因此他对干部的了解，比较全面，处理干部问题，比较公平。
    他一身正气，两袖清风，廉洁奉公，反对浮华、浪费等不正之风。例如解放初期，有些老干部把自己患难与共的革命伴侣抛弃了，另找年轻的对象。他对此深为不满，他曾对同志们说，这是缺乏革命道德的表现。而他自己又是身体力行的，他的老伴没有文化，而且缠过脚，他并不嫌弃，长期患难与共。他的子女也非常敬爱妈妈，家庭关系非常融洽。他的老伴先去世，他常带子女去八宝山革命公墓祭扫。对于他的4个子女，他要他们自己去闯，不要靠父亲做后台。从这里也可以看他是如何正确对待家属子女的。
    李克农同志离开我们已经20多年了。回忆这些往事，仿佛他那可敬的慈容又出现在我们面前，他那感人的语言又使我们受到一次深刻的教育。重温他的言行和教导，是为了深切地纪念他并再次从他的榜样中吸取深刻的教益。
