Since moving into the new residence, we have seen each other very rarely. Recently, I heard that you are not feeling well, and I am quite concerned. I hope you will actively seek medical treatment and rest well!

On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the _Literary Arts_ bimonthly magazine, I would like to extend my congratulations to you all!

You asked me to share some thoughts. I have no new ideas, only some old ones:

As a literary platform, the bimonthly magazine should continue to focus on publishing works by novice writers, even if they are not yet well-known. It should also include works by established authors who are not currently in the spotlight. The magazine should not actively seek contributions from famous writers or trendy authors.

The magazine should not chase after fads; it should not seek sensationalism; it should not regard loud and boastful language as truth; it should not idolize those who seek attention.

In terms of content, this platform should continue to cultivate the essentials of literature—grains, vegetables, fruits, and the like. In terms of form, the magazine should remain simple and unadorned, like a farmer in a raincoat and straw hat, or a woman in a simple headdress and cloth dress.

Each issue could include one or two pages of literary essays, making the magazine more lively compared to just publishing creative works.

The young editors should be encouraged to study literature, read more selected works, and learn about grammar, rhetoric, and punctuation.

As for me, in my declining years, I often forget words when I pick up my pen, making it difficult for me to write anything worthwhile for you. Lately, I have felt uneasy about still being associated with the literary world. I think you can understand this feeling.

I wish you a speedy recovery!

### 孙犁致邹明  祝贺与希望

1989-10-31
第8版(副刊)
专栏：

　　孙犁致邹明
　　祝贺与希望
　　邹明同志：
    自迁入新居，我们就很少见面。近又得知你身体不适，甚为挂念。望积极医治，安心调养为盼！
    值此《文艺》双月刊创刊10周年之际，谨向你们表示祝贺！
    你要我谈一些想法。我没有新的想法，只有旧的想法：
    作为园地，双月刊应继续以选登初学写作者，虽然初学、但尚不很出名的作者，已经有名、但在目前并不走红的作者——这些人的作品为主。
    不强向时代明星或时装模特儿那样的作家拉稿。
    不追求时髦；不追求轰动；不以甚嚣尘上之辞为真理；不以招摇过市之徒为偶像。
    作为内容，这片园地里，种植的仍是五谷杂粮，瓜果蔬菜；作为形式，这个刊物，仍然是披蓑戴笠，荆钗布裙。
    每期前面，可以增加一、二页文艺短论式的文章，这样，比只登创作，更活泼一些。
    编辑部的青年同志，要叫他们进修文化，多读一些文学作品的选本。读一些文法、修辞、标点符号方面的书。
    至于我，衰年多病，提笔忘字，很难为你们写一点像样的文章了。近来，深以仍挂名文场，感到不安。这种心情，我想你是能理解的。
    祝你早日恢复健康！
                    孙犁
                一九八九年九月廿二日
