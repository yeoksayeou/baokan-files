Stores selling expired pastries, beverages, canned goods, and other items are clearly taking advantage of customers. However, the harm is not limited to the consumers; the factories producing these foods also suffer significantly. The immediate market and long-term reputation can be severely damaged by just one or two bottles or packages of expired food that are detected.

Recently, a food inspection center in Beijing purchased two large bottles of Ningxia-produced health tonic soda from a Beijing commercial market for a comprehensive soda inspection across the entire Beijing market. Unfortunately, these two bottles happened to be expired: the factory's label indicated a shelf life of 6 months, but the bottles purchased had already exceeded this period by 3 months. Technically, they should not have been on the shelf, but the inspectors did not notice the expiration at the time. Later, they realized the production date from the label. After the inspection, it was found that the two bottles of soda had excessive bacterial contamination. The inspection center then reported this to their superior unit, noting in the remarks column that the products were "past the expiration date." However, in a series of mishaps, the superior unit compiled a report for the media, omitting the note about the expiration.

After this result was published, the producer of the health tonic soda, Qingqiongxia City Beverage Company, faced a storm of trouble—several wholesale units came to return goods, and the factory suffered significant economic losses. The factory director, Li Jie, personally traveled to Beijing to explain the situation. Li Jie felt wronged! He said, "Hygiene is a matter of life and death, and we do not dare to be careless with our products. Recently, we sent our products to the Beijing City Epidemic Prevention Station and the National Food Quality Supervision and Inspection Center for testing, and the results were fully compliant." Li Jie anxiously told the reporter, "Now we have been harmed by 'expired food.' Stores should not sell expired items in the future!"

Just this one incident caused both consumers and producers to suffer, and even the stores lost their credibility. However, the problem does not end there—who should bear the economic loss when the factory's food is past its expiration date and cannot be sold after being distributed to stores? Should the store or the factory compensate the consumer for purchasing expired food? Everyone knows that "expired" is bad, but how can society form an effective mechanism to prevent it from happening? These questions still linger in economic life.

    莫让过期货坑人害厂
    吴锦才
    店铺里把过期的糕点、饮料、罐头等拿来卖，人们都明白这坑苦了顾客。其实，在生产食品的工厂这一头，所受的为害也不轻——眼前的市场，长久的信誉，常常为了一两瓶、一两包被检测到的过期食品而大受损害。
    不久前，一个食品检测中心在北京一家商场买了两大瓶宁夏产的健身可乐，参加整个北京市场汽水检查。谁知这两瓶偏偏就是过期的：瓶子上工厂规定保质期为6个月，买到手的已经超期3个月，按说不该在柜台上摆了，偏巧检测者又没注意这是过期货，后来才从商标上注意到生产日期。抽检后，发现这两瓶可乐中细菌超标太多，于是检测中心列表向上级单位上报，只是在备注栏中注明“已过保质期”。谁知一波三折，错中又错，上级单位汇总了一个表格向新闻界散发时，却又删去了这过期的说明字样。
    这个结果公布后，给健身可乐生产者青铜峡市饮料总厂引来轩然大波——好几家商业批发单位来人、来电退货，工厂经济损失惨重。厂长李杰为此事专程来京四处奔走，说明真实情况。李杰真感到委屈！他说：卫生状况是人命关天的大事，我们产品可不敢马虎。最近又拿产品到北京市防疫站、国家食品质量监督检测中心去检测，结果是完全达标的。李杰焦急地对记者说，这下我们可被“过期食品”害苦了。商店今后再不要出售过期的东西了！
    就这么一件事，让消费者和生产者都吃到苦头，连商店也信誉扫地。但是问题并不就此了结——工厂将食品批发给店铺后过了期卖不掉，经济损失应由谁分担？消费者买了过期食品的损失，是应由商店还是由工厂赔付？人人皆知“过期”不好，全社会又怎样形成遏止它露头的有效机制呢？这些疑团仍然萦绕在经济生活当中。
