Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 23rd.

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today at a press conference: On October 11, 1989, the government of Belize established so-called "diplomatic relations" with the authorities of Taiwan. The government of Belize's erroneous decision violates the principles of the 1987 joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Belize, as well as Belize's commitments on the Taiwan issue. The government of the People's Republic of China has decided to suspend diplomatic relations with Belize effective immediately.

In recent times, the authorities of Taiwan, disregarding national interests, have used financial inducements to lure certain countries into establishing or re-establishing "diplomatic relations," attempting to create a situation of "dual recognition" and to manufacture "two Chinas." This is contrary to the authorities of Taiwan's own stance that "there is only one China" and will not succeed. The Chinese people will ultimately achieve the great cause of national reunification.

We hope that the government of Belize will consider the long-term interests of both China and Belize, return to the correct path, and adhere to the principles of the joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, so that relations between China and Belize can return to normal development.

### 外交部发言人宣布  中国中止同伯利兹外交关系

　　外交部发言人宣布
　　中国中止同伯利兹外交关系
    本报北京10月23日讯　外交部发言人今天在新闻发布会上宣布：1989年10月11日，伯利兹政府同台湾当局建立了所谓“外交关系”。伯利兹政府这一错误决定，违背了1987年中伯建交联合公报的原则和伯利兹政府对台湾问题的承诺。中华人民共和国政府决定，自即日起中止同伯利兹的外交关系。
    最近一个时期以来，台湾当局不顾民族大义，以重金收买的手段，引诱个别国家同其“建交”或“复交”，企图搞“双重承认”，制造“两个中国”，这是违背台湾当局关于“中国只有一个”的主张的，也是不能得逞的。中国人民终将要实现祖国的统一大业。
    我们希望伯利兹政府能从中伯两国的长远利益考虑，迷途知返，回到两国建交公报的原则立场上来，使中伯关系重新得到正常的发展。
