October 4th of this year marked the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Guinea. Ambassador Abdoulaye Soumah of Guinea to China, while reviewing the healthy and continuous development of Sino-Guinean friendly relations, expressed deep emotions and enthusiasm.

Over the past 30 years, Sino-Guinean friendship and cooperation have grown stronger. In 1960, during President Sekou Toure's visit to China, the two countries signed a friendship treaty, which was the first such treaty China signed with an African country. Since then, leaders and delegations from both countries have frequently visited each other and signed agreements on railways, trade, commodity credits, medical and health care, and more. Economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two countries have also continued to develop. Last July, President Lansana Conte's successful visit to China made new contributions to consolidating and enhancing Sino-Guinean friendship.

Guinea is located on the Atlantic coast and is rich and beautiful. Some say that Guinea is a potential wealthy country. This is because it has a unique geographical advantage and abundant natural resources. Guinea has gold, iron, diamonds, uranium, oil, and significant hydroelectric potential. Its bauxite reserves are the largest in the world. Guineans proudly call themselves "people sitting on a treasure chest." For a long time, the Guinean government has made a series of attempts and unremitting efforts to maintain national sovereignty and develop the national economy. China highly appreciates and fully supports the Guinean people's tenacious struggle for national independence and revitalization.

Although China and Guinea are far apart, the hearts of the two peoples are closely connected. When talking about the friendly cooperation between the two countries, Ambassador Soumah said, "This cooperation has been very effective and has played a very important positive role in Guinea's economic development." He listed in detail the cooperation between the two countries in the fields of energy, construction, agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, society, and culture. He particularly praised the Chinese experts in Guinea for their diligence and positive evaluations, and for doing a lot of beneficial work to promote Sino-Guinean friendly cooperation.

Indeed, over the past 30 years, batches of Chinese doctors and engineering technicians have almost traversed the beautiful land of Guinea, forging deep friendships with the local people. In the blooming Konakry Park, in the majestic People's Palace in the capital, in the magnificent Kamsar hydroelectric station, in the remote depths of the forest, in the "Water Tower of West Africa" Fouta Djallon Plateau... how many stories of friendship have been left behind!

"In the future, our cooperation will be more extensive and diversified," Ambassador Soumah said when looking forward to the prospects of Sino-Guinean friendly cooperation. "It is sincere cooperation that binds us together. We hope that this cooperation can continue forever and become a model of relations between countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

### 真诚的合作  牢固的友谊

    真诚的合作  牢固的友谊
    本报记者  王芳
    今年的十月四日，是中国和几内亚建交三十周年纪念日。几内亚驻华大使阿卜杜拉赫曼·索乌先生在回顾中几两国友好关系健康持续发展的历程时，无限感慨，充满激情。
    三十年来，中几友谊与合作与日俱增。一九六零年塞古·杜尔总统访华时，双方签订了友好条约，这是中国同非洲国家签订的第一个友好条约。在此之后，两国领导人和代表团互访频繁，并签订了铁路、贸易、商品信贷、医疗卫生等协定。两国的经济合作与文化交流也不断发展。去年七月，孔戴总统对中国的成功访问，又为巩固和增进中几友谊作出了新的贡献。
    几内亚位于大西洋畔，富饶美丽。有人说，几内亚是个潜在的富国。因为它有得天独厚的地理优势，大自然赐予它丰富的地下宝藏。几内亚有黄金、铁、钻石、铀、石油和潜力很大的水力资源，铝土矿的蕴藏量居世界之首。几内亚人自豪地称自己是“坐在百宝箱上的人”。长期以来，几内亚政府为维护国家主权，发展民族经济进行了一系列尝试和不懈的努力。中国高度赞赏并完全支持几内亚人民为民族的独立和振兴而顽强奋争的精神。
    中几相距虽远，两国人民的心却紧密相连。在谈及中几间的友好合作时，索乌大使说：“这种合作是卓有成效的，在几内亚的经济发展中起了极为重要的积极作用。”他如数家珍，详细列举了两国在能源、建筑、农牧渔业、社会、文化等方面的合作。他特别称赞中国专家在几内亚工作勤奋，受到好评，为促进中几友好合作做了许多有益的工作。
    的确，三十年来，一批批中国医生和工程技术人员几乎走遍了几内亚秀美的国土，同那里的人民结下了深厚的友情。在花团锦簇的科纳克里公园，在首都雄伟的人民宫，在壮观的金刚水电站，在边远的密林深处，在誉为“西非水塔”的福塔贾隆高原……留下了多少友谊的故事！
    “今后我们的合作将更为广泛和多样化”，索乌大使在展望中几友好合作前景时指出，“是真诚的合作把我们连在一起。我们希望这种合作能够永远继续下去，并成为在和平共处五项原则基础上国与国关系的典范。”
