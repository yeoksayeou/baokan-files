The Publicity Department, the Ministry of Culture, and the State Administration of Cultural Heritage recently issued a joint document calling on all regions to extensively carry out propaganda activities under the theme "Everyone Loves and Protects National Relics" to ensure the safety of national relics and fully utilize their functions.

The document states that China is one of the countries with the most relics in the world. There are 500 national key cultural relics protection units, 62 historical and cultural cities, and 5 historical and cultural sites listed as World Heritage Sites. There are approximately 4,000 provincial-level cultural relics protection units, and more than 100,000 cultural relics sites nationwide. The movable cultural relics preserved in cultural relics collection institutions, as well as in units and individuals, number in the millions.

The document points out that protecting relics and utilizing their functions are of great significance in promoting the prosperity and development of the Chinese nation and socialist motherland. A large number of historical relics, as symbols of national unity, contain immense appeal and cohesion, playing an irreplaceable role in maintaining national unity and state stability. Historical relics are vivid textbooks of patriotism, which can educate future generations to correctly understand the glorious history of the Chinese nation's hard work, bravery, perseverance, and arduous struggle, inherit and carry forward the nation's fine traditions, and enhance national confidence and pride. Relics, as carriers of historical culture, are primary historical materials for historical research and important references and sources for scientific inventions and artistic creations. Through the observation, appreciation, and research of relics, people can cultivate their morals, inspire their wisdom, and receive the benefits of traditional virtues and aesthetic values.

The document states that protecting relics is a matter of national and ethnic interests for generations to come. A nation and ethnic group that values the construction of modern civilization must highly value and cherish their historical and cultural heritage. China has a fine tradition of protecting relics. Many enlightened individuals have always regarded relics as national treasures, carefully collecting and studying them, passing them down from generation to generation. The Communist Party and the people's government have inherited and carried forward this fine tradition, consistently valuing the protection of relics. Even during wartime, every effort was made to reduce and prevent the destruction of relics by war. In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, the state has regarded the protection of relics as an important cultural undertaking, establishing specialized institutions and organizing teams to undertake the management of relics, and successively formulating a series of laws, policies, and guidelines to guide and ensure the healthy development of the relics industry.

The document emphasizes that the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Cultural Relics" is the legal standard for strengthening the management and protection of relics and a powerful weapon for combating crimes such as the theft, robbery, and smuggling of relics, and for stopping the destruction of relics. All citizens must consciously abide by the law, love and protect national relics, and unremittingly fight against all illegal and criminal activities that damage relics. Voluntarily handing over discovered relics to the government, reporting illegal and criminal activities related to the theft, robbery, smuggling, and trafficking of relics, stopping the destruction of relics, and promoting relics and laws and policies related to relics, as well as participating in relics protection activities, are all manifestations of patriotism and should be respected and praised by the whole society and nation. The state will give due recognition and rewards to units and individuals who have made contributions to the protection of national relics in accordance with the law.

The document requires that cultural relics departments and relevant parties should, through radio, television, film, newspapers, periodicals, and other forms, carry out multi-level and multi-dimensional propaganda of the "Law on the Protection of Cultural Relics," promote the value and function of relics, popularize knowledge of relics and relics protection, commend good deeds of loving and protecting national relics, expose illegal and criminal activities of stealing and destroying relics, and carry out public opinion supervision of relics protection management work, arousing the masses to consciously engage in the cause of relics protection.

    “人人爱护祖国文物”
    中宣部文化部国家文物局发出通知，要求各地广泛开展宣传活动，以确保文物安全
    新华社北京10月3日电　中宣部、文化部和国家文物局近日联合发出文件，要求各地通过多种形式广泛开展“人人爱护祖国文物”的宣传活动，以确保祖国文物安全，充分发挥文物的作用。
    文件说，我国是世界上保存文物最多的国家之一，已公布全国重点文物保护单位500个、历史文化名城62座；已列入世界文化遗产的名胜古迹5处；省、自治区、直辖市级文物保护单位约4000个；全国文物史迹已超过10余万处；保存在文物收藏机构以及单位和个人手中的可移动文物，更是数以千万计。
    文件指出，保护文物，发挥文物作用，对于促进中华民族和社会主义祖国的兴旺、繁荣、昌盛，有着多方面的重大意义。大量的历史文物作为民族团结的象征，蕴藏着巨大的感召力和凝聚力，在维护民族的团结和国家的统一方面发挥着无可替代的纽带作用。历史文物是爱国主义的生动教材，可以教育子孙后代正确认识中华民族勤劳勇敢、坚韧不拔、艰苦奋斗的光辉历史，继承和弘扬民族的优良传统，增强民族自信心和自豪感。文物作为历史文化的载体，是历史研究的第一手史料，是科学发明和文艺创作的重要借鉴与源泉。人们通过对文物的参观、鉴赏和研究，可以陶冶情操、启迪智慧，受到传统美德和审美价值的教益。
    文件说，保护文物，是关系到国家和民族利益的千秋事业。一个重视现代文明建设的国家和民族，必须高度重视和珍惜自己的历史文化遗产。我国历史上有着保护文物的优良传统，许多有识之士历来把文物视为“国宝”，精心收藏，潜心研究，使之世代相传。共产党和人民政府继承发扬这一优良传统，一贯重视文物保护，即使在战争年代，也千方百计减少和防止战火对文物的破坏。建国40年来，国家将文物保护作为一项重要的文化事业，设立专门机构、组织队伍承担文物管理任务，同时相继制定一系列文物法令、方针、政策，指导和保证文物事业的健康发展。
    文件强调，《中华人民共和国文物保护法》是加强文物保护管理的法律准则，是打击盗掘、盗窃和走私文物等犯罪活动，制止破坏文物的有力武器。全体公民都要自觉遵法守法，爱护祖国文物，与一切破坏文物的违法犯罪行为作不懈的斗争。凡是发现文物主动上交政府，举报盗掘、盗窃、走私、倒卖文物违法犯罪活动，制止破坏文物，宣传文物和文物法令、政策，参与文物保护活动的行为都是爱国主义的表现，应该受到全社会和全民族的尊重和称赞，国家对为保护祖国文物作出贡献的单位和个人，依法给予表彰和奖励。
    文件要求，文物部门和各有关方面要通过广播、电视、电影和报纸、书刊等各种形式，多层次、多方位地宣传《文物保护法》，宣传文物的价值与作用，普及文物和文物保护知识，表彰爱护祖国文物的好人好事，揭露盗窃和破坏文物的违法犯罪活动，对文物保护管理工作实行舆论监督，唤起民众，自觉地投身于文物保护事业。
