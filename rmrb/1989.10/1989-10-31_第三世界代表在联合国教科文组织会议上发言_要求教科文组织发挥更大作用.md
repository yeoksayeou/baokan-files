Representatives from the Third World countries attending the 25th General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) unanimously called for UNESCO to play a more effective role in promoting peace and development, particularly in advancing the educational, scientific, cultural, and exchange initiatives of developing countries.

The 10-day general policy debate concluded today. Representatives from various countries pointed out that education is an urgent issue facing all countries, especially those in the Third World. UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor said that currently, there are nearly 1 billion illiterates worldwide, which is a "shame" for the entire globe. He emphasized that the issue of education should be prioritized by UNESCO. Some representatives from Third World countries noted that global economic imbalances are a fundamental cause of the education crisis. Heavy debts, falling prices of raw materials, and rising prices of imported goods have hindered the efforts of Third World countries, particularly those in Africa, to improve education.

Representatives from various countries expressed support for the United Nations' declaration of 1990 as the International Literacy Year and UNESCO's decision to hold the "Conference on Popular Education" in Thailand next March.

News exchange was a contentious issue among representatives, particularly between Third World countries and Western nations. The Tunisian representative believed that UNESCO should not abandon the principles and achievements of establishing a New World Information and Communication Order. The Cuban representative condemned the practice of controlling and exerting pressure on Asian, African, and Latin American countries through powerful communication means. The Chinese representative stated that the demand by developing countries to establish a new world news and communication order is completely justified and necessary.

Some representatives also pointed out that intellectual exchanges and cooperation between countries should be mutual development rather than one-sided dependence. The Indonesian representative noted that there is a trend worth noting: developed countries impose their cultural values and concepts on developing countries, using cultural and technological means to influence them, making them dependent rather than truly free.

　　第三世界代表在联合国教科文组织会议上发言
　　要求教科文组织发挥更大作用
    新华社巴黎10月30日电  （记者沈孝泉）出席联合国教科文组织第25届大会的广大第三世界国家的代表一致呼吁，教科文组织应该在促进和平与发展，特别是在推动发展中国家教育、科学、文化和交流事业方面发挥更加有效的作用。
    本届大会为期10天的总政策辩论于今天结束。各国代表指出，教育是世界各国，特别是第三世界国家面临的一个紧迫问题。教科文组织总干事马约尔说，目前全世界共有近10亿文盲，这是全球的“耻辱”。他说，教育问题要摆在教科文组织优先解决的问题之首。一些第三世界国家的代表指出，世界经济不平衡是产生教育危机的根本原因之一。沉重的外债、原材料价格的下跌和进口产品价格的上涨等因素使第三世界，特别是非洲国家在改善教育方面的努力受到挫折。
    各国代表对联合国把1990年宣布为国际扫盲年、教科文组织决定明年3月在泰国召开“大众教育会议”等活动表示支持。
    新闻交流是各国代表，特别是第三世界国家和西方国家之间争论较大的问题。突尼斯代表认为，教科文不应该放弃曾经主张过的建立国际新闻新秩序的原则和成果。古巴代表谴责了那种通过强大的传播手段对亚、非、拉美各国实行控制和施加压力的做法。中国代表指出，发展中国家要求建立新的世界新闻和传播秩序的主张是完全正当和十分必要的。
    一些代表还指出，各国间的智力交流与合作应该是相互发展，而不是单方依赖的关系。印尼代表说，当前有一种倾向值得注意，即发达国家把自己的文化价值观念强加给发展中国家，利用文化、科技手段向发展中国家施加影响，使之附属于自己而不是使之获得真正的自由。
