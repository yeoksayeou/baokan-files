Fujian's Shishi is known as "Little Hong Kong," and tourists say that if you haven't been to Shishi, you haven't truly been to Fujian. However, the commercially prosperous Shishi has in recent years become a notorious "yellow stronghold" – a large number of pornographic videotapes are distributed from here across the country.

In response to the severe and persistent problem of pornographic videotapes in Shishi, the Fujian Provincial Committee decided to concentrate efforts to solve the issue in Shishi.

Provincial Committee Secretary Chen Guangyi said that whether the problem in Shishi can be solved is a test for the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government. No matter how serious the problem is, how great the difficulties, or how strong the resistance, we must solve the problem in Shishi.

On September 17th, Provincial Committee Standing Member and Propaganda Department Director He Shaochuan led a team of 15 department-level officials from various provincial departments to Shishi. At the same time, Quanzhou Municipal Committee Secretary Zhang Mingjun and Deputy Secretary Shi Zhaobin also led more than 30 officials to Shishi. The five current leaders of Shishi Municipal Committee and Municipal Government also threw themselves into the "anti-pornography" struggle. Later, Provincial Committee Secretary Chen Guangyi and Deputy Secretary Jia Qinglin also rushed to Shishi to inspect and guide the "anti-pornography" work. To support Shishi's "anti-pornography" efforts, the entire Quanzhou city mobilized, with Shishi Town as the focus, adopting a three-layer "encirclement" and unified action deployment. That is, using the three surrounding towns of Shishi as the first layer, Jinjiang County as the second layer, and other counties and districts in the Quanzhou region as the third layer, concentrating forces to conduct a large-scale inspection and destruction of pornographic dens.

Under the guidance of the provincial and municipal working groups, Shishi City mobilized the masses, deploying propaganda vehicles to the streets and villages; various units hung and posted large banners, wall newspapers, and bulletin boards; conducted positive education for all primary and secondary school students; held symposiums with township officials, various democratic parties, social organizations, and primary and secondary school teachers, making the "anti-pornography" campaign deeply rooted in people's hearts. The municipal government also established a reporting station and a reporting hotline. Under the strong social public opinion offensive, some individuals voluntarily surrendered to the judicial departments and exposed and reported crimes, all of whom were treated leniently.

On the basis of extensive mobilization, Shishi City took decisive measures for a sudden inspection, severely cracking down on the production and distribution of pornographic materials. From September 19th to 21st, 2,274 personnel were dispatched to inspect every household in five key streets and villages, conduct sudden searches on dozens of key households, and inspect stations, docks, hotels, dance halls, music tea houses, and other places. They also inspected various post offices, postal agencies, and freight stations for past parcels and consignment receipts.

At the same time, all bookstores, newspaper stands, and audio-visual markets in the city were ordered to close for rectification, and a law enforcement study class was organized to study documents and raise awareness, requiring them to confess their own or expose others' illegal behaviors. Additionally, Shishi City organized judicial departments to quickly handle major cases discovered during the "anti-pornography" campaign. From January to mid-September this year, Shishi had already uncovered 197 cases of illegal production and distribution of videotapes and obscene materials, seizing 75,856 videotapes (including 5,825 obscene tapes), 1,206 sets of nude playing cards, and 13,150 obscene books and paintings. Twenty-five copying dens were shut down, and 95 color TVs and 284 VCRs used for copying were seized, along with a batch of criminal tools. Since September 19th, seven deeply hidden videotape copying dens have been destroyed, seizing 5,644 videotapes and a batch of obscene books, paintings, and nude playing cards. One hundred and twelve lawbreakers have been legally tried, and a batch of VCRs, TVs, walkie-talkies, and other criminal tools have been seized.

After this period of effort, the problem of selling pornographic videotapes in the Shishi market has been basically stopped.

This action has been warmly supported by the general public and various sectors of society. The principal of Shishi Experimental Primary School said that this anti-pornography campaign is of great merit in cultivating the next generation. Some business people said that if Shishi's prosperity was built on the production of pornography, we would rather be a bit poorer. An overseas Chinese who invested in a restaurant in his hometown told government officials that if his relatives were involved in the production and distribution of pornography, he would request that the government punish them according to law. Such things are also prohibited abroad.

Shishi Municipal Committee Secretary Liu Chengye said that some people were previously concerned that the anti-pornography campaign would affect Shishi's economic development, but now it seems unnecessary. Currently, Shishi's clothing market and small commodity market are still active, and industrial production is proceeding normally.

    拔掉“黄色据点”
    ——记福建石狮的“扫黄”工作
    郑青祖
    福建的石狮素有“小香港”之称，旅游者说，没到过石狮，就不算到过福建。然而，商业繁荣的石狮近年来竟成了赫赫有名的“黄色据点”——大量黄色录像带从这里流向全国。
    针对石狮市黄色录像带严重泛滥屡禁不止的问题，福建省委决心集中力量解决石狮的问题。
    省委书记陈光毅说，石狮问题能否解决，对省委、省政府是一次考验。无论问题多么严重，困难多大，阻力多强，都要把石狮的问题解决好。
    九月十七日，省委常委、宣传部长何少川带领省直有关部门十五名厅、处级干部组成的工作组赶赴石狮，同时，泉州市委书记张明俊、副书记石兆彬也带领三十多名干部进驻石狮。石狮市委、市政府五位现任领导也全力以赴投入“扫黄”斗争。稍后，省委书记陈光毅、副书记贾庆林也赶赴石狮检查、指导“扫黄”工作。为了配合石狮的“扫黄”，泉州全市总动员，以石狮镇为重点，采取三层“包围”、统一行动的部署，即以石狮周围三个乡镇为第一层，晋江县为第二层，泉州地区其它县、区为第三层，集中力量，统一进行大规模清查、捣毁黄窝。
    在省、市工作组的指导下，石狮市放手发动群众，出动宣传车深入街头、村落；各单位悬挂、张贴大幅标语，出墙报、板报；对全市中小学生进行正面教育；召开乡镇干部、各民主党派、社会团体、中小学教师参加的座谈会，使“扫黄”深入人心。市政府还设立了举报站和举报电话。在强大的社会舆论攻势下，一些人主动到政法部门投案自首、检举揭发，均得到宽大处理。
    在广泛动员的基础上，石狮市采取果断措施进行突击清查，严厉打击制黄贩黄犯罪分子。仅九月十九日至二十一日，就出动二千二百七十四人次对全市五个重点街村进行逐户宣传、检查，对几十个重点户进行突击搜查，并对车站、码头、旅社、舞厅、音乐茶座等进行检查，还检查了各邮电局、代邮点、联运站过去的包裹、托运存单。
    与此同时，对全市所有书报刊和音像市场实行停业整顿，集中开办法制学习班，学习文件，提高认识，要求他们交待自己或揭发别人的违法行为。另外，石狮市还组织政法部门对“扫黄”中发现的大案从快查处。今年一至九月中旬，石狮已经查获非法制作、贩卖录像带及淫秽物品案件一百九十七起，收缴录像带七万五千八百五十六盒（其中淫秽带五千八百二十五盒）、裸体扑克一千二百零六副、淫书淫画一万三千一百五十本，取缔复制窝点二十五个，缴获复制用彩电九十五台、录像机二百八十四台，抓获一批违法犯罪分子。九月十九日以来，又捣毁埋藏较深的录像复制窝点七个，收缴录像带五千六百四十四盒和一批淫秽书刊、淫画、裸体扑克，依法审理违法人员一百一十二人，还收缴了一批录像机、电视机、对讲机等作案器具。
    经过这段时间的努力，石狮市场上贩卖黄色录像带问题基本得到制止。
    这一行动受到了广大群众和社会各界的热烈拥护。石狮实验小学的负责人说，这次扫黄，对培养下一代来讲功德无量。一些工商界人士说，如果石狮是靠制黄繁荣起来的，我们宁可清贫一些。一个在家乡投资办饭店的华侨对政府干部讲，如果他的亲属参与制黄贩黄，要求政府依法惩处，这种东西在国外也是被禁止的。
    石狮市委书记刘成业说，以前有人担心，扫黄会影响石狮的经济发展，现在看来是多余的，目前石狮服装市场和小商品市场依然活跃，工业生产正常进行。
