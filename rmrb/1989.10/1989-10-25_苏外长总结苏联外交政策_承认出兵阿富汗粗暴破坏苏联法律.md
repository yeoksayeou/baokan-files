Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 23rd.

Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze today, in a report to the Supreme Soviet, pointed out that the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan was an extremely brutal violation of Soviet law, contravening the principles and morals of the Party and the people.

Shevardnadze said that the decision to invade Afghanistan was made without the knowledge of the Party and the people, resulting in serious consequences for the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Foreign Minister summarized the Soviet Union's foreign policy since 1985 and criticized some of the previous actions.

When discussing relations with China, Shevardnadze said, "We must cherish and highly value our relations with this great socialist country. Past events should not be repeated." He said, "Objective analysis shows that in the past, all efforts were not made to prevent the split with China, to ease tensions, and to avoid confrontation." He believed that "the Soviet people and the Chinese people have paid a high price for the mutual estrangement of the past few decades, with hundreds of billions of rubles and a large amount of resources being spent on building 'confrontational infrastructure.'"

When discussing Soviet-American relations, Shevardnadze said that next year's summit between the Soviet Union and the United States will shift Soviet-American relations from mutual understanding to mutual cooperation, primarily in the area of nuclear disarmament. He expressed that the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is of great significance. He believed that the Soviet Union's establishment of the Krasnoyarsk radar station violated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This foreign minister also said that when the United States stopped producing chemical weapons in 1969, the Soviet Union continued to produce them at great expense.

When discussing relations with the Warsaw Pact countries, Shevardnadze said that these countries have undergone historic changes, and the Soviet Union will develop relations with them on the basis of sovereign equality, non-interference, and the recognition of each country's absolute right to choose freely. He believed that old methods should not be followed, and economic, technological, and cultural cooperation should be established on new foundations.

Shevardnadze also discussed the relationship between reform and diplomacy. He believed that the main driving force behind Soviet foreign policy is reform, the innovation, and democratization of Soviet society. He said that the laws being reviewed by the Supreme Soviet, including the "Property Law" and other fundamental laws, are necessary prerequisites for the Soviet Union's broad participation in the international division of labor and the coordination of the Soviet economy with the world economy.

　　苏外长总结苏联外交政策
　　承认出兵阿富汗粗暴破坏苏联法律
    新华社莫斯科10月23日电  苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在最高苏维埃会议上作报告时指出，苏联1979年出兵阿富汗极其粗暴地破坏了苏联法律，违反了党和公民的准则及道德。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，出兵阿富汗的决定是背着党和人民作出的，给苏联造成了严重后果。
    苏联外长总结了1985年以来的苏联外交政策，并对苏联以前的某些作法进行了批评。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽在谈到同中国的关系时指出，“我们必须珍视和非常重视同这个伟大社会主义国家的关系，过去的事情不应当重演。”他说，“客观分析证明，过去并没有尽一切努力来防止同中国的决裂，缓和冲突和不发生对抗”。他认为，“苏联人民和中国人民为过去几十年的相互疏远付出了昂贵的代价，数百亿卢布、大量的资源被耗费在建立‘对抗的基础设施’上”。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽在谈到苏美关系时说，明年举行的苏美最高级会晤将使苏美关系从相互理解转入相互合作，首先是在核裁军方面的合作。他表示，签署限制进攻性战略武器条约具有原则性意义。
    他认为，苏联建立克拉斯诺亚尔斯克雷达站的行为违反了反导弹防御条约。这位外长还说，当1969年美国停止生产化学武器的时候，苏联却不惜巨额资金继续生产化学武器。
    在谈到同华约国家的关系时，谢瓦尔德纳泽说，这些国家已经发生了历史性的变化，苏联将同它们在主权平等、不允许任何干涉和承认每个国家绝对自由选择的权力的基础上发展关系。他认为，不应当按照过去形成的老办法行事，经济、科技和文化合作需要建立在新的基础上。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽还谈到了改革同外交的关系。他认为，苏联外交政策的主要动力是改革，是苏联社会的革新和民主化。他说，苏联最高苏维埃正在审议的《所有制法》和其他一系列基本法律，是苏联广泛参加国际劳动分工、苏联经济与世界经济相协调的必要前提。
