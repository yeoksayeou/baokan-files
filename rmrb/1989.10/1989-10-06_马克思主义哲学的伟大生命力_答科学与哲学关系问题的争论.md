Edition: 6

The editor's note: What is the relationship between Marxist philosophy and science, especially natural science? This is a scholarly question that has been discussed in the field of philosophy in our country. On this issue, Fang Lizhi has taken a completely negative attitude towards Marxist philosophy, claiming that Marxist philosophy is outdated and has little use. This article is also a critique of this "outdated theory."

At the beginning of this century, Marxist philosophy underwent the test of the latest discoveries in natural science (X-rays, radioactivity, and electrons, etc.) and proved its correctness. Now, a scientific and technological revolution is on the rise, and new problems are emerging one after another. Can Marxist philosophy withstand this new test and continue to achieve new proofs and victories? I believe that this is the essence of the recent debate in our country on the relationship between science and philosophy.

Firstly, Marxist philosophy includes not only a natural view but also a historical view; secondly, modern science includes not only natural science but also social science and technological science. Therefore, the issue of the vitality of Marxist philosophy should be analyzed from these three aspects.

One: The Influence of Marxist Philosophy on Modern Social Science

This aspect has been widely recognized by Western scholars. In the field of history, the famous historian J. H. Plumb, who once served as the president of the British Historical Association, wrote in "The Present State of Historical Studies" (1978): Marxist philosophy "provides the only satisfactory basis for the rational arrangement of the complex events of human history" (J. H. Plumb: "The Present State of Historical Studies," Shanghai Translation Publishing House, 1987, p. 27). It is the only "historical philosophy" that "still retains vitality and intrinsic potential today" (ibid., p. 261). In the field of futurology, the famous American futurologist Daniel Bell wrote in "The Coming of Post-Industrial Society" (1973) that all the sociological theories about the future of capitalism in the 20th century are almost "in dialogue with Marx's second schema" (i.e., Volume III of "Capital") (Daniel Bell: "The Coming of Post-Industrial Society," Commercial Press, 1984, p. 73). In the field of economics, the famous British economist Joan Robinson, although she called Marx's truth about labor creating value, which was summarized from the history of natural development and social development, a so-called "metaphysics," she also had to admit, "This metaphysics is powerful and has shaken the world several times" (Joan Robinson and John Eatwell: "An Introduction to Modern Economics," Commercial Press). In the discussion on the relationship between philosophy and science, our comrades did not mention this important field. It seems that those who shout "Marxism is outdated" are either ignorant or deliberately covering up the facts that foreign scholars have already recognized.

Two: The Influence of Marxist Philosophy on Modern Technological Science

There have already been fruitful research results in this area. Among the internationally influential works are: "Civilization at the Crossroads: The Significance of the Scientific and Technological Revolution for Society and Man" (1967), edited by the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, and "Man, Science, Technology: A Marxist Analysis of the Scientific and Technological Revolution" (1973), co-edited by the Soviet and Czechoslovak Academies of Sciences. The famous American philosopher of technology, Durbin, had to admit that Marxism is one of the most influential schools of contemporary technological philosophy, far surpassing the Anglo-American and Western European schools in terms of consistency in views and methods (see Durbin, ed.: "A Cultural Guide to Science, Technology, and Medicine," 1980). In addition, the famous German philosopher of technology, Rap, has also mentioned the great influence of Marxist philosophy in this field several times. Therefore, limiting the discussion of the relationship between philosophy and science to the scope of natural science is obviously one-sided.

Three: The Influence of Marxist Philosophy on Modern Natural Science

Regarding the close connection and mutual influence between philosophy and natural science, this is acknowledged by philosophers of all schools and scientists in various fields of natural science. The famous physicist M. Born, who proposed the statistical interpretation of the wave function in quantum mechanics, pointed out in "My Life and My Views on Physics": "Regarding philosophy, every modern scientist, especially every theoretical physicist, is deeply aware that his work is intertwined with philosophical thinking, and without sufficient knowledge of philosophical literature, his work will be ineffective. In my own life, this is a major thought" (Born: "My Life and My Views on Physics," Commercial Press, p. 26). One of the founders of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg, also clearly believed that "since the 16th and 17th centuries, the development of philosophical ideas closely related to the basic concepts of science has been a precursor to the great development of natural science and has influenced each other" (Heisenberg: "Physics and Philosophy—The Revolution in Modern Science," Science Press, 1974, p. 39). The reason why philosophy and natural science have a deep intrinsic connection is that the basic concepts and basic assumptions in natural science theories have the universal characteristics of philosophy. It is in this sense that Einstein emphasized that philosophy is "the mother of all scientific research" ("Collected Works of Einstein," Commercial Press, Vol. 1, p. 519).

Therefore, the question at issue is not general philosophy, but whether Marxist philosophy has any effect on the study of natural science. Here, we will discuss this from the following several aspects.

1. Sociological Study of Natural Science as a Whole

This is a discipline that emerged in the 1930s, known as the science of science, and it is generally believed that Bernal and Merton are the founders. The direct cause of the emergence of this discipline was the report presented by the Soviet delegation at the Second International Congress of the History of Science held in London in 1931, which proposed the study of the history of science from the perspective and methods of Marxism. In particular, the report by Gessen on "The Social and Economic Roots of Newton's 'Principles'" used the Marxist philosophical view that the development of science depends on social and economic conditions to study the driving force and laws of scientific development, taking Newtonian mechanics as an example. Bernal said that this conference made Western scholars "first truly discover the theoretical foundation of Marx's dialectical materialism, which had existed in Western Europe for half a century but had not been appreciated by anyone" (Bernal: "The Social Function of Science," Commercial Press, 1982, p. 523). The research results of the Soviet delegation showed that "the application of Marxism to science can and is providing so many rich new concepts and perspectives for understanding the history of science, the social functions, and roles of science" (ibid.).

The application of Marxist philosophy to the sociological study of natural science promoted the formation and development of the science of science, and a large number of influential works were published, such as: Bernal's "The Social Function of Science" (1939), Merton's "Science, Technology, and Society in Seventeenth-Century England" (1938), Hogben's "The Science of the People" (1938), Glasser's "The Social Relations of Science" (1941), and Baber's "Science and Social Institutions" (1953), etc. The great influence of the Marxist worldview and methodology on the science of science can be seen from this.

2. Philosophical Study of Natural Science as a Whole

This is essentially the epistemology, methodology, and logic of the entire natural science. It is fundamentally different from modern Western philosophy of science in terms of views and methods, and therefore also has significant differences in content. In the Soviet Union, this field is called the dialectics of nature, which was later renamed the philosophical problems of natural science. Its research roughly went through three stages: First, from 1953 to 1964, it mainly studied the philosophical problems in various natural sciences, especially physics and biology, and published the "Series on Dialectical Materialism and Modern Natural Science"; second, from 1964 to 1980, it mainly studied general scientific methodology, such as experiments, models, descriptions, explanations, predictions, etc., while critically introducing the modern Western philosophy of science represented by Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos; third, from 1980 to the present, it mainly studies the common basic problems of various natural sciences under the conditions of the scientific and technological revolution, such as the structure of matter, the integration of knowledge, the relationship between man and nature, the integration of science, technology, and production, etc., some of which have caused different degrees of response abroad.

In our country, the in-depth study of the dialectics of nature and the critical introduction of modern Western philosophy of science began only in 1978. For Marxist philosophy to have a significant impact in this field, a great deal of effort is still needed. However, so far, our country has already published a number of articles and monographs. It can be predicted that the flag of Marxist philosophy will soon be planted on this battlefield.

3. Historical Study of Individual Natural Sciences

The use of Marxist philosophical views and methods to study the history of scientific thought began long ago. Marx and Engels' loyal comrade, one of the founders of modern organic chemistry, Schorlemmer, used dialectical materialism to summarize the history of organic chemistry before the 1890s, and wrote "The Origin and Development of Organic Chemistry" (1894), proving that the development of chemistry proceeds according to the laws of dialectics.

In the 1930s, the Japanese physicist Takeo Takabayashi applied dialectical materialism to the study of the history of physics and proposed the "three-stage theory" methodology. He believed that human understanding of nature is realized through three stages: phenomenology, substantialism, and essentialism. The first stage is the true observation of the phenomena of things; the second stage is the exploration of how matter is constituted; the third stage reveals the laws of motion of material objects. He pointed out that Newtonian mechanics and quantum mechanics are both understood through these three stages. Takabayashi's methodology for the history of physics has had a strong response internationally (L. M. Brown [USA]: "Physics and Philosophy," in "Science and Philosophy," Journal of Dialectics of Nature, 1981, No. 3). The American particle physicist Brown once seriously discussed the role of the three-stage theory method in the history of physics research and current particle theory research. The famous physicist Sakata Shoichi said that the "three-stage theory" based on the dialectical view of nature has greatly contributed to the healthy growth of particle theory in Japan.

In the early 1980s, the famous biologist Mayr wrote a monumental work: "The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance" (1982). He agreed with Engels' opposition to reductionism and used the method of dialectics to analyze the development of biological thought. For example, on the issue of the special essence of life phenomena, he believed that the thesis is the vitalism represented by Aristotle in ancient times; the antithesis is the mechanism represented by Descartes in the 16th century, and the synthesis is the systems theory represented by Bertalanffy in the 20th century (Mayr: "The Growth of Biological Thought," Harvard University Press, see p. 51). This shows that the development of biological thought is also in accordance with the laws of dialectics.

It can be seen that the guiding role of the Marxist worldview and methodology in the study of the history of scientific thought is beyond doubt. In the future, with the passage of time, it will certainly show its great power more and more.

4. Epistemology and Methodology of Individual Natural Sciences

In modern natural science at the forefront, many epistemological and methodological problems have been raised. Einstein said: "The current difficulties in physics force physicists to delve deeper into philosophical problems than their predecessors" ("Collected Works of Einstein," Vol. 1, p. 405). Bohr also said, "In the laws that atomic processes obey, we are faced with a completely new epistemological problem in natural philosophy" (N. Bohr: "Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge," Commercial Press, 1978, p. 28). It is precisely on this frontier of natural science that the vitality of philosophy is subjected to the most severe test. Because, according to the function and mission of philosophy, first, it should theoretically summarize the latest achievements of natural science, from which to derive general epistemological and methodological principles; second, it should provide inspiration or guidance from the worldview and methodology when natural science proposes basic concepts and assumptions to solve the theoretical difficulties it faces.

In the first mission of philosophy, the modern scientific revolution, starting from the theory of relativity, has raised epistemological and methodological problems for philosophy, such as the concept of physical reality, the method of theoretical physics, the relationship between theory and experience, and the speculative characteristics of the basic concepts and assumptions of physics.

There is comparison before there is discrimination. Here, two representative figures are cited, one is the British Eddington, and the other is the Soviet Fock, to illustrate how different philosophical schools make their own generalizations and summaries.

There are many commonalities between them. 1. They are both world-renowned scientists; 2. They both have outstanding mathematical talents (Einstein said: Eddington's "The Mathematical Theory of Relativity" is the best exposition on this subject in all countries. The German mathematician Ehrenfest said that Fock can handle very difficult mathematical problems.); 3. They have both made outstanding and multifaceted contributions in their respective fields; 4. Most importantly, they have both conducted in-depth research on the theory of relativity, and their masterpieces have used almost the same titles "Space, Time, and Gravitation."

However, Eddington and Fock are fundamentally different in their philosophical generalizations of the theory of relativity. First, regarding the relationship between relativity and absoluteness. Eddington believed that the theory of relativity proved that the physical world is relative and is given by scientists. Fock, on the other hand, believed that the "relativity" in the theory of relativity and "relativism" in philosophy should not be confused: "relativism" in philosophy emphasizes the relativity of knowledge and denies the objectivity of knowledge; while the "relativity" in the theory of relativity refers to the fact that time, space, and motion are determined by a certain reference system in nature, and are therefore relative; in the special theory of relativity, they are determined by the inertial reference system; in the general theory of relativity, they are determined by the distribution of matter and energy. However, time, space, and motion are also absolute, because they are constrained by the specific reference systems that exist in nature. In other words, they are reflections of the objective natural world. Second, regarding the opposition between idealism and materialism. Eddington believed that in relativistic physics, the important thing is measurement, and measurement has subjective and relative qualities. Fock, on the other hand, believed that in relativistic physics, the most essential thing is not measurement, but the real relationship between objects, the objective qualities of time and space. Therefore, the theory of physics should not be regarded as a tool for adjusting, organizing, and arranging sensory experiences, but as the reflection in thought of an independently existing material world.

Fock's "The Theory of Space, Time, and Gravitation" (1955) was universally recognized internationally. In the preface to this book, he wrote: "My views on the theory of space, time, and gravitation were formed under the influence of dialectical materialist philosophy, especially under the influence of Lenin's 'Materialism and Empirio-Criticism.' The teachings of dialectical materialism helped me to critically examine Einstein's views on the theory of relativity and to re-examine this theory."

In the second mission of philosophy, the history of science shows that without Marxist philosophy, science has made and is making many major discoveries and, on this basis, has proposed new concepts and hypotheses. Taking the discoveries in physics over the past two centuries as an example:

In 1789, Galvani's discovery of the electric current could not be explained by the theory of the nature of electricity established by Franklin at that time;
In 1820, Oersted's discovery of the effect of the electric current on the magnetic needle, followed by Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction, later led to the establishment of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, but it was theoretically impossible to foresee Oersted's discovery;
In 1896, Becquerel's discovery of radioactivity laid the foundation for nuclear physics, but it was difficult to predict the phenomenon of radioactivity according to the theory at that time.

For the above new scientific discoveries, the existing theories could not explain or predict them. In such cases, to propose new views, concepts, and hypotheses to explain them and to predict their theoretical and practical value, it is necessary to resort to the worldview and methodology of philosophy. It should be admitted that the mechanistic philosophy of three hundred years ago played a great role and influence in this regard. Marxist philosophy has only been born for more than a hundred years, and the establishment of the first socialist state with it as the guiding ideology has only been more than seventy years. It is undoubtedly a long process to play a role in this regard and to undergo repeated struggles with other philosophical schools. However, so far, we have already seen some major victories. Under the guidance of Engels' thought on the infinitude of matter, its various non-continuous parts are different nodes, in 1955, the famous Japanese theoretical physicist Sakata Shoichi, based on the empirical laws of strong interaction particles summarized from experiments at that time, proposed the composite model of strong interaction particles, i.e., the Sakata model. This achievement caused a strong response internationally. Other fields of natural science have also shown the power of Marxist philosophy. We firmly believe that in the 19th century, Marxist philosophy was able to make a great summary of the latest achievements of natural science at that time and propose brilliant prophecies. Therefore, in the 20th century, it will further enrich itself with the great achievements of modern natural science and continue to play its outstanding guiding role.

Long live Marxist philosophy!

    马克思主义哲学的伟大生命力
    ——答科学与哲学关系问题的争论
    黄顺基
    编者按：马克思主义哲学与科学特别是自然科学的关系是什么？这是我国哲学界讨论的一个学术问题。在这个问题上，方励之对马克思主义哲学采取全盘否定的态度，说什么马克思主义哲学过时了，没有多大用处了。本文也是对这种“过时论”的批判。
    本世纪初，马克思主义哲学经受了自然科学最新发现（X射线、放射性和电子等）的考验，证明了它的正确性。现在，一场科学技术革命正在兴起，新的问题层出不穷，马克思主义哲学是否能经受这次新的考验，继续获得新的证明和新的胜利呢？我认为，这是不久前我国关于科学与哲学关系争论问题的实质。
    首先，马克思主义哲学不仅包括自然观，还包括历史观；其次，现代科学不仅包括自然科学，还包括社会科学和技术科学。因此，马克思主义哲学的生命力问题，应该从这三个方面来分析。
    一、马克思主义哲学对现代社会科学
    这方面的巨大影响是西方学者所公认的。在历史学领域内，曾任英国历史学会主席的著名历史学家杰·巴勒克拉夫在《当代史学主要趋势》（1978）中写道：马克思主义哲学“提供了合理地排列人类历史复杂事件的使人满意的唯一基础”（杰弗里·巴勒克拉夫：《当代史学主要趋势》，上海译文出版社，1987年，第27页），它是“今天仍保留着生命力和内在潜力的唯一的‘历史哲学’”（同上书，261页）。在未来学领域内，美国著名未来学家丹·贝尔在《后工业社会的来临》（1973）中认为，二十世纪所有关于资本主义未来的社会学理论，几乎“都是同马克思的第二种图式（指《资本论》第三卷——引者）的对话。”（丹·贝尔：《后工业社会的来临》，商务印书馆，1984年，第73页）。在经济学领域内，英国著名经济学家琼·罗宾逊在《现代经济学导论》（1974）中，虽然把马克思关于劳动创造价值这一从自然发展史与社会发展史总结出来的真理说成是所谓“形而上学”，但是，她也不得不承认，“这种形而上学是强有力的，几次震撼了世界。”（琼·罗宾逊与约翰·伊特韦尔：《现代经济学导论》，商务印书馆）。在哲学与科学关系问题的讨论中，我们的同志没有提到这一个重要的领域，看来，叫嚷“马克思主义过时论”的人或者是无知，或者是有意掩盖国外学者都已公认的事实。
    二、马克思主义哲学对现代技术科学
    这方面已经有了丰硕的研究成果。其中产生了国际影响的，如：捷克科学院主编的《十字路口的文明：科学与技术革命对社会和人的意义》（1967），苏联与捷克两家科学院主编的《人，科学，技术：对科学技术革命的马克思主义分析》（1973）。美国著名的技术哲学家杜尔宾不得不认为，马克思主义是当代技术哲学最有影响的学派之一，它在观点与方法的一致性方面远远超过英美学派和西欧学派（见杜尔宾编：《科学技术与医学的文化指南》，1980）。此外，西德著名的技术哲学家拉普也多次提到马克思主义哲学在这一领域中的巨大影响。因此，把哲学与科学的关系问题仅仅局限在自然科学范围内讨论，这显然是不全面的。
    三、马克思主义哲学对现代自然科学
    关于哲学与自然科学之间的紧密联系和相互作用，这是各派哲学家和各门自然科学家都一致承认的。提出量子力学波函数的统计解释的著名物理学家M·波恩在《我的一生和我的物理学观点》中指出：“关于哲学，每一个现代科学家，特别是每一个理论物理学家，都深刻地意识到自己的工作是同哲学思维错综地交织在一起的，要是对哲学文献没有充分的知识，他的工作就会是无效的。在我自己的一生中，这是一个最主要的思想。”（波恩：《我的一生和我的物理学观点》，商务印书馆，第26页）。量子力学创始人之一海森堡也明确认为，“自从十六、十七世纪以来，与科学基本概念密切联系的哲学观念的发展，成为自然科学巨大发展的前驱，并互相影响。”（海森堡：《物理学与哲学——现代科学中的革命》，科学出版社，1974年，第39页）。哲学和自然科学之间有着深刻的内在联系的原因在于，自然科学理论中的基本概念与基本假设都带有哲学的普遍性的特征，正是在这个意义上，爱因斯坦强调指出，哲学“是全部科学研究之母”（《爱因斯坦文集》商务印书馆，第1卷，第519页）。
    因此，争论的问题不是一般的哲学，而是马克思主义哲学究竟对自然科学的研究有无作用。这里我们分别从以下几个领域作出论述。
    1、自然科学整体的社会学研究
    这是三十年代兴起的一门学科，称为科学学，一般认为，贝尔纳、默顿是奠基人。这门学科产生的直接原因是，1931年在伦敦举行的第二次国际科学史代表大会上，苏联代表团提出的关于用马克思主义的观点与方法研究科学史的报告，其中特别是盖森作的《牛顿“原理”的社会根源和经济根源》的报告。这篇报告运用马克思主义哲学关于科学发展有赖于社会经济条件的观点，以牛顿力学为例，研究了科学发展的动力问题与规律性问题。贝尔纳说，这次大会使西方学者“第一次真正地发现了在西欧存在了半个世纪却无人加以赏识的马克思的辩证唯物主义的理论基础”（贝尔纳：《科学的社会功能》，商务印书馆，1982年，第523页）。苏联代表团的研究成果表明，“把马克思主义应用于科学，可以而且正在为理解科学史、科学的社会功能和作用提供多么丰富的新概念和新观点。”（同上）
    把马克思主义哲学应用于自然科学的社会学研究，推动了科学学的形成与发展，出版了一大批很有影响的著作，如：贝尔纳的《科学的社会功能》（1939）、默顿的《十七世纪英国的科学、技术与社会》（1938）、霍格本的《大众的科学》（1938）、格劳瑟的《科学的社会关系》（1941）、巴贝尔的《科学与社会制度》（1953）等等。马克思主义哲学的世界观与方法论对科学学的巨大影响，由此可见一斑。
    2、自然科学整体的哲学研究
    这实质上是整个自然科学的认识论、方法论与逻辑学。它和现代西方科学哲学在观点与方法上根本不同，从而在内容上也大有区别。在苏联，这个领域叫自然辩证法，后改名为自然科学的哲学问题。它的研究大致经历了三个阶段：一、1953——1964年，主要研究各门自然科学特别是物理学和生物学中的哲学问题，出版了《辩证唯物主义和现代自然科学丛书》；二、1964——1980年，主要研究一般科学方法论，如实验、模型、描述、解释、预测等等，与此同时，批判地介绍了以波普尔、库恩和拉卡托斯等为代表的现代西方科学哲学；三、1980年到现在，主要研究科学技术革命条件下各门自然科学共同的基本问题，如：物质的结构、知识的综合、人与自然的关系、科学——技术——生产一体化，等等，其中不少成果在国外引起了不同程度的反响。
    在我国，自然辩证法的深入研究和现代西方科学哲学的批判介绍，从1978年才开始。马克思主义哲学对这一领域要发生显著的作用，还需要经过很大的努力。不过，到目前为止，我国已经陆续出了不少论文和专著。可以预料，把马克思主义哲学的旗帜插到这块阵地上，为期已经不远了。
    3、自然科学个体的思想史研究
    运用马克思主义哲学的观点与方法研究科学思想史，早就开始了。马克思和恩格斯的忠实战友、近代有机化学的奠基人之一肖莱马，运用唯物辩证法总结了十九世纪90年代以前有机化学的历史，写出了《有机化学的产生和发展》（1894），证明化学的发展是按辩证法的规律进行的。
    二十世纪30年代，日本物理学家武谷三男把唯物辩证法运用于物理学史研究，提出了“三阶段论”的方法论。他认为，人类认识自然是经过现象论、实体论与本质论三个阶段实现的。第一阶段是真实地观察事物的现象；第二阶段是探讨物质怎样构成的；第三阶段揭示了物质对象的运动规律。他指出，牛顿力学和量子力学都是经过这三个阶段才认识到的。武谷三男提出的物理学史方法论在国际上产生了强烈的反响（［美］L·M·布朗：《物理学和哲学》，见《科学与哲学》，自然辩证法通讯杂志社，1981年第3期）。美国粒子物理学家布朗曾就三阶段论方法在物理学史研究和当前粒子理论研究中的作用，进行了认真的讨论。著名物理学家坂田昌一说，以辩证自然观为基础的“三阶段论”，在很大程度上使得粒子理论在日本能够取得健康的成长。
    八十年代初，著名生物学家迈雅写出了一部巨著：《生物学思想的发展——多样性、进化与遗传》（1982）。他赞同恩格斯反对还原论的观点，并且运用了辩证法的方法来分析生物学思想的发展。例如，在关于生命现象的特殊本质问题上，他认为，正题是古代以亚里士多德为代表的活力论；反题是十六世纪以笛卡儿为代表的机械论，合题是二十世纪以贝塔朗菲为代表的系统论（迈雅：《生物学思想发展史》，哈佛大学出版社，参看第51页）。这说明，生物学思想的发展也是合乎辩证法的规律的。
    由此可见，马克思主义哲学的世界观与方法论在科学思想史研究中的指导作用是无容置疑的。今后，随着时间的推移，它必将更加显示出它的巨大威力。
    4、自然科学个体的认识论与方法论研究
    在现代自然科学前沿，提出了不少认识论与方法论问题。爱因斯坦说：“物理学的当前困难，迫使物理学家比其前辈更深入地去掌握哲学问题”（《爱因斯坦文集》，第一卷，第405页）。波尔也说，在原子过程所服从的那些独特的规律性问题上，我们面临着自然哲学中的一种全新的认识论问题。”（N·波尔：《原子物理学和人类知识》，商务印书馆，1978年，第28页。）正是在自然科学前沿这块阵地上，哲学的生命力受到了最严峻的考验。因为，按照哲学的功能和使命，第一，它理应对自然科学的最新成果作出理论概括，从中得出一般的认识论和方法论原则；第二，它在自然科学提出基本概念与基本假设以解决面临的理论困难时，能够从世界观和方法论上给以启发或指导。
    在哲学的第一个使命方面，现代科学革命，从相对论发端，向哲学提出了诸如物理实在的观念、理论物理的方法、理论同经验的关系、物理学基本概念与基本假设的思辨特征等认识论与方法论问题。
    有比较才有鉴别。这里举出两个代表人物，一位是英国的爱丁顿，一位是苏联的福克，借以阐明不同的哲学派别是如何作出自己的概括与总结的。
    他们之间有许多共同点。1、他们都是世界知名的科学家；2、他们都有优异的数学天才（爱因斯坦说：爱丁顿的《相对论的数学理论》是一切国家中关于这个题材的最优秀的表述。德国数学家爱伦弗斯特说，福克能够处理很难的数学问题。）；3、他们都在本学科领域作出多方面的、杰出的贡献；4、特别重要的是他们对相对论都有深刻的研究，而且，他们的名著都使用了几乎同样的名称“空间、时间与引力”。
    但是，爱丁顿和福克在相对论的哲学概括上是根本不同的。第一，关于相对与绝对的关系。爱丁顿认为，相对论证明了物理世界是相对的，是科学家给出的。福克则相反，认为相对论中的“相对”和“相对主义”不能混淆：哲学中的“相对主义”是强调知识的相对性，而否认知识的客观性；而相对论中的“相对”则是指时间、空间和运动是由自然界中一定的参考系来确定的，因而是相对的；在狭义相对论中是由惯性参考系确定；在广义相对论中则是由物质与能量的分布来确定。但是时间、空间与运动同时又是绝对的，因为它们受制约于自然界中存在着的特定的参考系。换句话说，它们是客观自然界的反映。第二，关于唯心与唯物的对立。爱丁顿认为，在相对论物理中重要的是测量，而测量带有主观的、相对的性质。福克则相反，认为在相对论物理中，最本质的东西，不是测量，而是物体与物体之间的现实关系，是时间与空间的客观性质。因而不能把物理学理论看成是调整、组织与安排感觉经验的工具，而是独立存在的物质世界在思维中的反映。
    福克的《空间、时间与引力理论》（1955年）在国际上得到了普遍的承认。他在该书的序言中写道：“我的关于空间、时间与引力理论的观点，是在辩证唯物主义哲学的影响下，特别是在列宁的《唯物主义与经验批判主义》的影响下形成的。辩证唯物主义的教导帮助我批判地对待爱因斯坦关于相对论的观点，并且使我重新考察这个理论。”
    在哲学的第二个使命方面，科学史表明，在没有马克思主义哲学的情况下，科学已经而且正在作出许多重大的发现，并在这个基础上提出了新的概念与新的假说，仅以两个世纪以来物理学的发现为例：
    1789年伽伐尼关于电流的发现，以当时由富兰克林创立的关于电的本质的理论来看，是无论如何也不能说明的；
    1820年奥斯特关于电流对磁针影响的发现，稍后法拉第关于电磁感应的发现，后来导致麦克斯韦电磁理论的创立，但要预见奥斯特约发现，这在理论上是不可能的；
    1896年贝克勒尔关于放射性的发现。这一发现奠定了核物理的基础，但是，依照当时的理论，很难预测出放射性现象。
    对上述这些新的科学发现，已有的理论无法作出解释或预见。在这种场合下，要提出新观点、新概念和新假设来说明它们，并预言它们的理论价值和实际价值，都有必要求助于哲学的世界观与方法论。应该承认，三百多年前的机械论哲学曾经在这方面发挥过巨大的影响和作用。马克思主义哲学诞生才一百多年，而且以它为指导思想的第一个社会主义国家的建立才七十多年，要在这方面发挥它的作用无疑要走过一段漫长的道路，要经历同其他哲学派别反复多次的较量。但是到目前为止，我们毕竟已经看到了一些重大的胜利。在恩格斯关于物质的无限性，它的各个非连续的部分是各种不同的关节点的思想指引下，1955年日本著名的理论物理学家坂田昌一，根据当时实验上总结出来的强相互作用粒子的经验规律性，提出了强相互作用粒子的复合模型，即坂田模型。这个成就在国际上引起了强烈的反响。其他自然科学领域也陆续在显示出马克思主义哲学的威力。我们坚定地认为，在十九世纪，马克思主义哲学既然能够对当时自然科学的最新成果作出伟大的总结，并提出光辉的预言。那么，在二十世纪，它必将进一步以现代自然科学的伟大成果来丰富自己，并继续发挥它杰出的指导作用。
      马克思主义哲学万古长青！
