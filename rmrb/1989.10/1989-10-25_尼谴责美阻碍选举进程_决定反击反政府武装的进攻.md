Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega on the 23rd condemned the United States for obstructing Nicaragua's election process.

Ortega, at a press conference following a meeting with the representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Elliott Richardson, said that the U.S. government is still hindering the demobilization and resettlement of Nicaraguan anti-government armed groups and continues to provide them with aid.

Ortega pointed out that the recent approval by the U.S. Senate of President Bush's plan to provide $9 million in election funds to the Nicaraguan opposition is obstructing Nicaragua's election process.

Nicaraguan representative Alejandro Serrano-Caldera today, in a speech at the UN General Assembly, condemned U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan opposition, saying it disrupts the election process supervised by the United Nations.

He said that the U.S. government has a political and moral responsibility to implement the Central American peace plan and has no right to obstruct it in any way.

Serrano-Caldera said that Pickering's accusations are groundless and that the U.S.'s actions are aimed at covering up its interference in Central America.

On October 21st, U.S. President Bush signed a bill providing $9 million to the Nicaraguan opposition to support their participation in the elections scheduled for next February.

In today's speech at the UN General Assembly, many representatives from Latin American countries expressed support for the United Nations' supervision of the peace process in Latin America and hoped that Nicaragua's elections would be conducted freely, fairly, and peacefully.

The Nicaraguan Presidential Palace issued a statement on the 23rd announcing that President Ortega held an emergency meeting with the Minister of Defense and other senior military officials on the 22nd to discuss the current military situation and decide on necessary defensive measures.

The statement said that on the 21st, anti-government armed groups in the northern Rio Blanco region of Matagalpa Province attacked government troops, killing and wounding 24 reserve soldiers.

The statement said that the Nicaraguan government has decided to launch a strong counterattack against the anti-government armed groups.

    据新华社马那瓜10月23日电　尼加拉瓜总统丹尼尔·奥尔特加23日谴责美国给尼选举进程设置障碍。
    奥尔特加在会见联合国秘书长代表埃利奥特·理查森后举行的记者招待会上说，美国政府目前仍在阻碍遣散和安置尼加拉瓜反政府武装分子的工作，并继续向他们提供援助。
    奥尔特加指出，美国参议院最近批准布什总统向尼反对党提供900万美元竞选费用的计划，阻碍了尼加拉瓜的选举进程。
    新华社联合国10月23日电  尼加拉瓜代表亚历杭德罗·塞拉诺—卡尔德拉今天在联大发言时谴责美国援助尼反对派，破坏由联合国监督进行的尼大选的进程。
    他说，美国政府对实施中美洲和平计划负有政治和道义上的责任，无权以任何方式对其进行阻挠。
    塞拉诺—卡尔德拉说，皮克林的指责毫无根据，美国的所作所为是为了掩盖其在中美洲进行的干涉活动。
    10月21日，美国总统布什签署了一项法案，规定向尼反对派提供900万美元以资助他们参加定于明年2月举行的大选。
    在联大今天的发言中，许多拉美国家代表对联合国监督拉美和平进程表示支持，并希望尼加拉瓜大选在自由、公正、和平的基础上进行。
