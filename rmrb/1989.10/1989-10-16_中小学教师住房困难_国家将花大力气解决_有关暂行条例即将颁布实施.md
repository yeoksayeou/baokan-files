From the meeting on the housing work of primary and secondary school teachers in some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions held here, our reporter, Li Erliang, learned that the housing conditions of urban primary and secondary school teachers, often referred to as "one shortcoming, two deficiencies," will gradually improve. The "Interim Regulations on Housing for Primary and Secondary School Teachers (Draft)" recently formulated by the State Education Commission provides a clear plan and basis for gradually improving the housing conditions of urban primary and secondary school teachers and will be promulgated and implemented in the form of regulations.

In recent years, the housing conditions of teachers in our country have been gradually improved. From 1983 to 1988, the total investment in housing construction for urban primary and secondary school teachers nationwide reached 2.139 billion yuan, with a total of 1.0486 million square meters of new housing completed. In 1987, the per capita housing area for urban primary and secondary school teachers nationwide increased from 3.8 square meters in 1982 to 5.09 square meters. However, according to a survey, in 1988, among the 1.8 million households of primary and secondary school teachers in cities and above, there were still 590,000 households without housing or with overcrowded housing. There were also 90,000 young teachers waiting to get married. A total of 25.17 million square meters of housing and approximately 6.3 billion yuan in investment are needed to solve the above problems. If calculated at the average construction speed of the previous few years, it will take another 15 years to solve the above problems.

Leaders from the State Education Commission pointed out: It is time to make a decision and invest heavily to solve the housing problems of primary and secondary school teachers.

The "Interim Regulations on Housing for Primary and Secondary School Teachers (Draft)" provides detailed regulations on the housing standards for urban primary and secondary school teachers, clearly defines the channels for raising and investing funds, and also formulates specific provisions for housing allocation and management.

The "Interim Regulations on Housing for Primary and Secondary School Teachers (Draft)" will be officially promulgated and implemented by relevant state departments after further soliciting opinions and making revisions.

    中小学教师住房困难  国家将花大力气解决
    有关暂行条例即将颁布实施
    本报郑州10月15日电　记者李而亮从此间召开的全国部分省市区中小学教职工住房工作会议上获悉：常被称为“一差二缺”的城镇中小学教师住房，今后将得到不断改善。国家教委最近制订的《中小学教职工住房暂行条例（草案）》，为逐步改善城镇中小学教师住房条件提供了明确的规划和依据，并将以法规形式颁布实施。
    近几年，我国教师的住房条件得到了逐步改善。1983年到1988年间，全国用于城市中小学教职工住房建设投资达21.39亿元，共建新宅竣工面积104.86万平方米。1987年全国城市中小学教职工人均住房由1982年的3.8平方米，提高到5.09平方米。但根据调查统计，1988年全国180万户住城镇以上中小学教职工中仍有无房户和拥挤户59万户，等房结婚的青年教职工还有9万人。以上共需解决住房2517万平方米，约需投资63亿元。若按前几年的平均建设速度计算，解决上述问题还要15年时间。
    国家教委有关领导指出：已经到了必须下决心，花大力气解决中小学教职工住房问题的时候了。
    《中小学教职工住房暂行条例（草案）》对城镇中小学教职工住房标准作了详细规定，还对筹资、投资渠道作了明确的规定、安排，对住房分配和管理也制定了具体细则。
    《中小学教职工住房暂行条例（草案）》，将在进一步征求意见修改后，由国家有关部门正式颁布实施。
