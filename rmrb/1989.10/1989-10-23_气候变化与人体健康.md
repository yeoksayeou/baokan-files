Climate Change and Human Health

People often experience unexplained feelings of depression, irritability during hot and humid weather, and periodic migraines during thunderstorms. In the past, these phenomena were often attributed to individual peculiarities. However, increasing research shows that almost every physiological function of the human body is influenced by climate change. It is reported that temperature is a significant factor. For example, when the temperature drops, blood vessels dilate, joint mobility decreases, nerve endings become less sensitive, and the secretion of thyroid hormones and adrenaline increases to help the body break down fat to produce the necessary heat. During this process, the body's magnesium and gamma globulin levels, which play crucial roles in fighting infections, significantly decrease. Most people can adapt to gradual climate changes, but sudden and irregular changes pose a threat to human health. For instance, during periods of extreme cold or heat, cases of phantom limb pain, acute appendicitis, kidney stones, and gallbladder pain are twice as common as usual. About eighty-seven percent of heart attacks occur during periods of significant atmospheric disturbances and peak cold or heat. The relationship between asthma attacks and peak cold or heat activity is even more pronounced. During these periods, elementary school students often become restless, and mental health patients may exhibit agitation. Notably, during periods of atmospheric electromagnetic disturbances, the incidence of traffic and workplace accidents increases by twenty-five percent.

Currently, there is no effective way to mitigate the harm caused by sudden climate changes to human health. However, a meaningful approach is seen in West Germany, where the radio broadcasts a "physiological monitoring" program daily for medical staff, reminding them to be prepared for an increase in the number of hypertension and asthma patients due to weather changes, and to make necessary medical and nursing preparations.

　　气候变化与人体健康
    人们大都有这样的体验：有时莫名其妙地感到情绪低沉；天气闷热时，易于急躁；雷雨天时，易患周期性偏头痛症。过去，这些现象常被看作是个人的特异体质的表现。而越来越多的研究表明，人体的任何一种生理机能，几乎都受气候变化的影响。据介绍，热度是重要的影响因素之一。例如，气温下降时，血管扩张，关节的活动机能减弱，神经末梢传感细胞迟钝，甲状腺素和肾上腺素分泌加速，以帮助机体分解脂肪来产生所需热量；而机体中，在对付感染过程中起重要作用的镁和伽马球蛋白的含量明显减少。大多数人对气候的持续变化有一定的适应性，危及人体健康的是突然而无规律的变化。例如，在冷热峰活动期间，幻肢痛、急性阑尾炎、肾绞痛和胆囊绞痛等病例是平时的两倍。心脏病发作约有百分之八十七发生在出现较大的大气扰动和冷热峰较活跃时。哮喘病的发作与冷热峰活动的关系更为密切。在此期间，还可看到在校小学生往往坐立不安，精神病患者出现骚动状态。尤其值得注意的是，在出现大气电磁紊乱期间，发生的交通和工伤事故比平时高出百分之二十五。
    目前，人们对气候突变对人体健康的危害还无能为力。但具有启迪意义的是，西德电台每天为医护人员播发“生理监测”节目，提醒他们注意，由于天气变化，高血压病患者和哮喘病患者人数可能增加，应做好必要的医药和护理准备。　　　于夫　伯臣　编译
