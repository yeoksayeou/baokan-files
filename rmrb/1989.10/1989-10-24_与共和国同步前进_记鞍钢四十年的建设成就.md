Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Anshan Steel), or Anshan Steel, is the same age as the People's Republic of China.

Forty years ago, a Japanese expert predicted: "The Chinese can only grow sorghum here."

Over the past 40 years, the people of Anshan Steel, with over 7,000 different specifications of steel products as their pens and 181 million tons of molten iron and 186 million tons of molten steel as their ink, have written the facts of steel: "The Communist Party of China not only knows how to grow sorghum but also knows how to manage socialist state-owned enterprises."

Whether it is a vertical comparison of thinking or a horizontal comparison of methods, Anshan Steel's transformation is evident to all—

In 1988, compared to 1949, the pig iron production increased from 101,600 tons to 7.8 million tons, steel production from 99,700 tons to 8 million tons, and steel product production from 77,600 tons to 5.6 million tons;

In 1988, profits and taxes had increased from 5 million yuan in 1949 to over 2.4 billion yuan;

Anshan Steel's red ore beneficiation technology is at the forefront of the world, and the double ball sintering technology is a revolution in iron smelting;

In the past 10 years, the steel conversion rate has increased from 75.05% to 85.94%, which is 0.53% higher than Japan in the same period;

This year, despite many difficulties, the people of Anshan Steel will still strive to increase profits and taxes by 10% compared to last year.

It is a cost, but also a treasure.

Anshan Steel is located on an iron mountain. During the Warring States period, iron tools were produced here, and the iron industry emerged during the Qin and Han dynasties. The Japanese operated here for 29 years, producing a total of 5.7 million tons of steel. The Kuomintang's "restoration of production" remained only in words, and in reality, Anshan Steel became a wasteland.

In 1949, a group of soldiers in yellow uniforms entered the Anshan Steel office, and many farmers with heads full of sorghum flowers came to the steel construction site. Could these people manage a large enterprise? Many people were worried. Soon, the first batch of molten iron produced by them was actually a declaration, announcing that they had begun exploring the management of socialist enterprises.

There is no need to hide the fact that the road of exploration is not a straight line, but the overall trend of this curve is upward. In the early 1950s, Anshan Steel invited Soviet experts and hired Chinese talents. The leaders were both officials and students. The shackles of small-scale production quickly broke, and the consciousness of industrialized large-scale production gradually took root in their minds. Steel production quickly recovered and developed. By 1957, pig iron production had reached 3.361 million tons, and steel production had reached 2.9107 million tons. In 1958, in a rush to succeed, family members were organized to "industrially combat drought," and soil blast furnaces were built to smelt steel, resulting in equipment damage and the production of scrap. However, Anshan Steel, through the promotion of technological revolution and technological innovation, still achieved good economic benefits. Their experience was summarized by Comrade Mao Zedong as the "Anshan Constitution." In 1960, compared to 1957, pig iron production increased by 53.5%, steel production increased by 92.8%, and steel product production doubled.

After 1961, Anshan Steel summarized the gains and losses of the "Great Leap Forward," and steel production developed steadily. In 1966, steel production reached 5.05 million tons, pig iron 4.6 million tons, and steel products 2.67 million tons, with a metal recovery rate reaching the world's advanced level. Unfortunately, the good times did not last long, and the ten years of turmoil threw Anshan Steel into the depths of disaster.

After the "Gang of Four" was overthrown, Anshan Steel's steel production quickly rebounded and developed.

In 1986, Li Huazhong, an expert who grew up in Anshan Steel, returned from Baosteel to become the company's manager, and Zhang Yu returned from the province to become the party secretary. They stood on the high ground of historical achievements and used horizontal comparison to replace vertical comparison, seeing that Anshan Steel's problems were not only lagging behind in the world but also in the country. This "steel marshal" was falling behind! They went to the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and the United States to inspect, and in the hometown of Marx and Einstein and successful places, they received one baptism after another of modern large-scale production. They reflected: Socialism indeed has advantages that capitalism cannot match, such as the workers being the masters of the enterprise, which determines that in the most active factor of productivity, socialism is superior to capitalism. It's just that our exploration time is still short, and we have not found a way to fully unleash the workers' role as masters. The two top commanders of Anshan Steel, Li Huazhong and Zhang Yu, had the same strategy to get out of the predicament: "Reform"!

Li Huazhong and Zhang Yu, like the two legs of a compass, cannot draw a circle without each other. They worked in harmony, launching a comprehensive, multi-level reform in the 40-mile steel city.

Step-by-step contracting, integrating the rights, responsibilities, and interests of producers, and strengthening the sense of ownership. They introduced a set of second-hand equipment for processing wire rods from the United States and built a wire rod factory with an annual production capacity of 500,000 tons. This method was effective. The factory, which would take 33 months to build abroad, was completed in only 13 months, and the production and quality both exceeded the original level. Each person creates 700,000 yuan in profits and taxes per year.

Management is a kind of labor, but some non-labor factors—power, blood relations, relationship learning, hierarchical system...—are all mixed in, while the most active factor in productivity—people—is rigidified. Li Huazhong and Zhang Yu discussed and decided that the leadership should be appointed through recruitment. The manager of the seamless steel pipe factory was not ideal after several appointments. Through public bidding, He Tinggui won the bid. He strengthened management and worked hard to mobilize the workers' enthusiasm as masters. In just over four months, he built a new seamless steel pipe factory with an annual production capacity of 100,000 tons, providing over 40 million yuan in profits and taxes that year, and was known as the "seamless model."

Anshan Steel insisted on reforming without changing the course, continuously improving the socialist enterprise, and giving full play to its advantages. For four consecutive years, profits and taxes increased by 10%, and workers' income increased significantly.

It is not magic, but magical power.

The equipment left by the Japanese was originally outdated, and the people of Anshan Steel were actually drawing their own blueprint on a polluted map. After decades of repairs and modifications, Anshan Steel was overloaded, and if it was not transformed, it would not be able to operate. But—

Where would the transformation funds come from? Where would the technology and equipment be introduced from? What would the guiding ideology be? The planned allocation of materials accounts for one-quarter of the country, and if production is reduced due to transformation, what should be done?

The two sides had been at a stalemate for ten years. In March 1986, in the 201 conference room of the white building in the green trees and red flowers of Anshan Steel, Manager Li Huazhong made the decision to end the "ten-year civil war" and put forward the historical decision on technological transformation: requirements—no stoppage of production, no reduction of production, and increase of production; policy—do not kill the chickens that lay eggs, and update the equipment in one go to reach the world's advanced level, achieving the coexistence of international advanced level, domestic advanced level, general level, and the original level that can still function; method—self-accumulation, self-transformation, and self-development, realizing a virtuous cycle.

Li Huazhong believed that learning from foreign countries should not be like the Eastern beauty imitating Xi Shi, but should grasp our own advantages—giving full play to the spirit of the workers being the masters under the socialist system. On the basis of the two wheels of management and technology turning together, he proposed adding a third wheel: ideological and political work, and called this wheel the "guiding wheel." Anshan Steel's technological transformation has shown Chinese characteristics. Half-continuous rolling is Anshan Steel's largest "money tree," which can produce over 100 ten thousand yuan a day, but due to long-term lack of cultivation and fertilization, the tree has aged. They used the method of the three wheels turning together to transform it in just 25 days of maintenance in 1986, and the production that year increased by 10% compared to the previous year.

After the technological transformation of half-continuous rolling, the No. 5 blast furnace, the No. 1 thin plate factory, the welded steel pipe factory, and others followed closely...

During this period, the speed of Anshan Steel's technological transformation was 60% faster than the general time required for similar-scale transformations in the world. Some foreign experts saw this speed and exclaimed in surprise: "It's simply magic." But the people of Anshan Steel said: "It's not magic, but the magical power of ideological and political work."

They are workers, but also masters.

The rolling molten steel and iron flow have nurtured generation after generation of workers in Anshan Steel.

In front of the Anshan Steel command center—the white building, cars and horses are bustling, and people going to and from work all see that flowers and pines surround a statue. He is Meng Tai, an outstanding representative of the working class, whom the people of Anshan Steel have always taken pride in. Although this old hero has long been at rest, his spirit nourishes generation after generation of Anshan Steel workers. Whether it is the "old Anshan Steel" who has worked here for many years, or the young people who have just entered the factory, as long as they see the statue's kind face, their minds will be filled with his tireless figure...

Hard work, frugal construction, and love for the factory like one's own home—Meng Tai's spirit is like a rich heritage, passed down from generation to generation in Anshan Steel.

"Walking ahead of time" Wang Chonglun inherited Meng Tai's spirit and created his own expression. This lathe worker guarded his post, worked hard to study technology for the country, invented the "universal tool holder," changed from producing one part at a time to producing several, and did four years and 17 days of work in one year. Then he gathered more and more technical backbones around the union and carried out technical cooperation activities...

As history entered the 1980s, the people of Anshan Steel, after decades of learning and preparation, elevated and developed Meng Tai's spirit. They shed the influence of the Asian workshop, crossed Taylor's "standard management," and welcomed the "impact of the future." More and more workers mastered modern scientific and technological knowledge and became more conscious of being the masters of the enterprise. "One-armed hero" Zhao Chengshun is a model. In the 1960s, he lost his left arm in a major overhaul. The physical pain and mental torment tormented this young man in his twenties, but it did not extinguish the flame of his ideals. The disadvantage of his limbs was a fait accompli, but the advantage of his brain could still be pursued. He pursued knowledge relentlessly, struggled hard, and in the washroom, in the boiler room, and sometimes in the toilet, he completed his studies at Liaoning Correspondence University's Mathematics Department and then obtained a diploma from Anshan Steel Institute's Computer Science Department. He studied and applied his knowledge, and with his colleagues, he completed 128 technological innovations, of which three reached the international advanced level, 15 reached the domestic advanced level, and three filled domestic gaps. In the discussion of how to transform the half-continuous rolling, he participated in the debate with his own plan and obtained the support of the company and the factory. He led the workers to complete the automation control of the continuous rolling machine, the automation control of the rolling machine, and the automation of the entire production process. People called him—

"The new Meng Tai of the 1980s!"

　　与共和国同步前进
　　——记鞍钢四十年的建设成就
　　本报记者　段心强
    鞍钢，与中华人民共和国同岁。
    40年前，一位日本专家预言：“中国人只能在这里种高粱。”
    40年来，鞍钢人以7000多种规格的钢材作笔，蘸着1.81亿吨铁水，1.86亿吨钢水，写下钢铁的事实：“中国共产党人不仅会种高粱，还能管好社会主义国营企业。”
    不管是纵向比较的思维方式，还是横向比较的思维方法，鞍钢的巨变有目共睹——
    1988年与1949年相比，生铁产量由10.16万吨上升为780万吨，钢产量由9.97万吨上升为800万吨，钢材产量由7.76万吨上升到560万吨；
    1988年利税已由1949年的500万元上升为24亿多元；
    鞍钢的红矿选矿技术在世界处于领先地位，双球烧结技术是炼铁史上的一次革命；
    近10年炼钢成材率由75.05％上升为85.94％，比日本同期多增加0.53％；
    今年困难很多、很大，鞍钢人仍要让利税比去年再增加10％。
    是代价，也是财富
    鞍钢坐落在铁山上。战国时期这里就生产铁器，秦汉时代出现冶铁业。日本在这里经营29年，满打满算产钢570万吨。国民党
  “恢复生产”只停留在嘴上，实际上鞍钢变成荒地。
    1949年，一批穿黄衣服的军人走进鞍钢的办公室，许多满头高粱花子的农民来到钢铁工地。这些人能不能搞好大企业？确有许多人捏一把汗。不久，他们炼出的新中国第一炉铁水，实际上是一篇宣言，声明他们开始了管理社会主义企业的探索。
    无需掩饰，探索的道路不是一条直线，但这条曲线的总趋势是向上的。50年代初，鞍钢外请苏联专家，内聘中国能人，领导人既当官，又当学生，小生产的紧箍咒迅速裂变，工业化大生产意识逐渐在头脑中刻下印记。钢铁生产很快得到恢复和发展，1957年，生铁已达到336.1万吨，钢达到291.07万吨。1958年，急于求成，组织家属“工业抗旱”，建土高炉砸锅炼钢，结果破坏了设备，出了废品。但是，鞍钢由于开展技术革命和技术革新，仍然取得很好的经济效益。他们的经验总结被毛泽东同志称之为“鞍钢宪法”。1960年与1957年相比，生铁产量增加53.5％，钢产量增加92.8％，钢材翻了一番。
    1961年以后，鞍钢总结“大跃进”中的失与得，钢铁生产稳步发展。1966年钢产量达到505万吨，生铁460万吨，钢材267万吨，金属回收率达到世界先进水平。很可惜，好景不长，十年动乱把鞍钢抛进灾难的深渊。
    打倒“四人帮”以后，鞍钢钢铁产量迅速回升和发展。
    1986年，在鞍钢成长起来的专家李华忠，从宝钢回来担任公司经理，张羽从省里回来出任党委书记。他们站在历史功过沉积起来的高地上，用横向比较法取代纵向比较法，看到鞍钢的问题，不要说在世界上，就是在国内，这位“钢铁元帅”是落后了！他们到联邦德国、法国、美国考察，在马克思和爱因斯坦的故乡和成功的地方，接受一次次现代化大生产的洗礼，对照鞍钢反思：社会主义确有资本主义不能比拟的优越性，像社会主义的工人是企业的主人，这就决定在生产力最活跃的因素上社会主义优于资本主义。只是我们探索的时间还短，没有寻找到让工人充分发挥主人作用的途径。鞍钢两位最高指挥官走出困境的对策不谋而合：“改革”！
    李华忠和张羽，如同圆规的两条腿，谁离了谁也划不圆。他们配合得珠联璧合，在40里钢城发动一场全方位、多层次的改革。
    逐级承包，让生产者的权、责、利结合，强化主人翁责任感。他们从美国引进一套加工线材的二手设备，要建年产50万吨的线材厂。这种办法取得成效。这个厂在国外要33个月才能建成，他们只用了13个月，而且产量和质量都超过原来的水平。每人每年创利税70万元。
    管理本是一种劳动，可一些非劳动的因素——权力、血缘、关系学、等级制度……都掺和进去，而生产力中最活跃的因素——人，却被僵固了。李华忠和张羽商议，领导干部由招聘代替任命。无缝钢管厂厂长几次任命都不理想，公开招标，何廷贵投标得中。他加强管理，努力调动工人主人翁的积极性，仅用4个多月时间，建成年产10万吨无缝钢管新厂，当年提供利税4000多万元，被称之为“无缝模式”。
    鞍钢坚持改革不改道，使社会主义企业不断完善，优越性得到发挥，连续4年，利税以10％递增，职工收入大幅度增长。
    不是魔术，是魔力
    日本人给鞍钢留下的设备本来就落后，鞍钢人实际上是在一张污染的图纸上绘制自己的蓝图。几十年修修补补，鞍钢超负荷运行，再不改造，就开不动了。但是——
    改造资金哪里来？技术设备从哪里引进？指导思想是什么？统配材占全国的1／4，因为改造减了产怎么办？
    两派意见打了十年的“持久战”，仍是两军对垒。1986年3月，鞍钢绿树红花中的大白楼201会议室里，经理李华忠拍板，结束“十年内战”，推出技术改造的历史决策：要求——一不停产，二不减产，三要增产；方针——能下蛋的鸡不杀，该更新的设备一步到位，达到世界先进水平，做到国际先进水平、国内先进水平、一般水平、尚能发挥作用的原有水平“四世同堂”；办法——自我积累，自我改造，自我发展，实现良性循环。
    李华忠认为，学习外国不能东施效颦，还是要抓住自己的优势——发挥社会主义制度下工人的主人翁精神。他在两个轮子——管理和科技一起转的基础上，提出增加一个轮子：思想政治工作，而且把这个轮子叫“导向轮”。鞍钢的技术改造搞出了中国特色。半连轧是鞍钢最大的一棵“摇钱树”，一天能摇下100多万元，但由于长期不培土施肥，树已老化。他们靠着三个轮子一齐转的办法，在1986年只用25天的中修时间对它进行了改造，当年产量比上年增加10％。
    继半连轧技术改造后，五号高炉、一薄板厂、焊接钢管厂，一个个紧步其后……
    这一时期，鞍钢技术改造的速度比世界上同规模的改造一般所需的时间减少60％。有的外国专家看到这种速度吃惊地说：“简直是玩魔术。”可鞍钢人说：“不是魔术，是思想政治工作的魔力。”
    是工人，也是主人
    滚滚的钢水铁流，造就着鞍钢一代又一代工人。
    鞍钢指挥中心——大白楼前，车水马龙，上下班的人都看到，鲜花、松柏簇拥着一个塑象，他就是鞍钢人世代引为自豪的工人阶级杰出的代表——孟泰。这位老英雄虽然长眠于九泉，但他的精神哺育着代代鞍钢人。不论是在这里工作多年的
  “老鞍钢”，还是刚进厂的小青年，只要看到这塑象慈祥的面容，脑海中就浮现出他那不知疲倦的身影……
    艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、爱厂如家——孟泰精神如同一笔丰厚的遗产，在鞍钢一代一代传下来。
      “走在时间前面的人”王崇伦，继承孟泰精神，创造着自己的表达方式。这个刨床工人坚守工作岗位，为国家刻苦钻研技术，发明“万能工具胎”，由一次生产一个部件变成生产几个，1年干了4年零17天的活。接着他把越来越多的技术骨干团结在工会周围，开展技协活动……
    历史进入80年代，鞍钢人经过几十年的学习和准备，使孟泰精神得到升华和发展。他们抛掉亚细亚作坊的影响，越过泰勒的“定额管理”，迎接“未来的冲击”，越来越多的工人掌握现代化的科学技术，更自觉地当企业的主人。“独臂英雄”赵成顺是一个典范。他60年代在一次大修中失去左臂。肉体上的疼痛和心灵上的苦痛折磨着这个二十出头的青年，但没压灭他心中理想的火炬。手脚方面的劣势已成定局，大脑方面的优势还可争取。他孜孜追求，苦苦拚挣，在洗脸室，在锅炉房，有时在厕所里，他读完了辽宁函授大学数学系，接着获得鞍山钢院电子计算机系的毕业文凭。他边学边用，和同事一起先后搞成技术革新128项，其中3项达到国际先进水平，15项达到国内先进水平，3项填补了国内空白。在讨论半连轧如何改造时，他以自己的方案参加议论，并得到公司和工厂的支持，带领职工完成连轧机自动化控制、卷板机自动化控制、整个生产过程自动化等三大技术改造。人们称他是——
    “八十年代新孟泰”！
