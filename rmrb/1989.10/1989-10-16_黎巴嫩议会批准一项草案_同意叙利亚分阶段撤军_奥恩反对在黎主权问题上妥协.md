Lebanese Parliament Approves Draft for Phased Syrian Withdrawal
Oren Opposes Compromise on Lebanese Sovereignty

CAIRO, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) — After lengthy debates, a committee of the Lebanese Parliament reached a preliminary consensus in Taif, Saudi Arabia, on a timetable for the limited and phased withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

According to attendees, the foreign ministers of the Arab Three-Party Committee member states, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Algeria, also participated in the meeting.

It is reported that the Lebanese Parliament will hold a full session under the chairmanship of Speaker Hussein to approve this draft.

Details of the draft have not yet been reported. However, it is believed that the timetable for the phased withdrawal of Syrian troops from Beirut is a sign of reconciliation among the warring factions in Lebanon.

BEIRUT, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) — Lebanese Christian militia leader General Oren issued a statement today, urging Lebanese parliamentarians attending peace talks in Taif, Saudi Arabia, not to compromise on the issue of Lebanese sovereignty.

He said that the Lebanese people will not tolerate those who sell out Lebanese sovereignty.

According to reports, both sides have reached an agreement on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and the addition of nine parliamentary seats for Muslims in the peace plan. However, there are still disagreements over the issue of Syrian withdrawal.

The Christian faction demands guarantees for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and links this to the political reforms demanded by the Muslim faction. The Muslim faction insists on the phased withdrawal of Syrian troops, withdrawing from the Beirut area to the eastern Bekaa Valley within two years, and then fully withdrawing after signing a Syrian-Lebanese security treaty.

    黎巴嫩议会批准一项草案
    同意叙利亚分阶段撤军
    奥恩反对在黎主权问题上妥协
    新华社开罗10月12日电  经过长时间的辩论之后，黎巴嫩议会一个委员会在沙特阿拉伯的塔伊夫城举行的会议今天就叙利亚有限制和分阶段地从黎巴嫩撤军的时间表取得了初步一致的意见。
    据参加会议的人士说，提议叙利亚军队分阶段撤出黎巴嫩的阿拉伯三方委员会成员国沙特阿拉伯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的外长也参加了会议。
    据报道，黎巴嫩议会将在议长侯赛尼主持下，举行议会全体会议批准这个草案。
    目前还没有关于这一草案的详细报道。但可以认为，确定叙利亚分阶段从贝鲁特撤军的时间表是黎巴嫩交战各派和解的一种表现。
    新华社贝鲁特10月14日电  黎巴嫩基督教军政府领导人奥恩将军今天发表一项声明，呼吁在沙特阿拉伯塔伊夫举行和平谈判的黎巴嫩议员不要在黎巴嫩主权问题上妥协。
    他说，黎巴嫩人民绝不会容忍出卖黎巴嫩主权的人。
    据报道，双方在和平计划中关于以色列从黎巴嫩南部撤军和增加穆斯林9个议会席位的问题上达成了协议，但在叙利亚撤军问题上仍有分歧。
    基督教派要求保证叙利亚从黎巴嫩撤军，并以此同穆斯林派要求的政治改革相联系。而穆斯林派则坚持叙利亚分阶段撤军，2年内从贝鲁特地区撤到东部贝卡谷地，在签订叙黎安全条约之后再全部撤走。
