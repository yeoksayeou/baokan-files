Twenty young scholars, including doctoral, master's, and undergraduate students who recently enlisted from civilian universities, from the Military Academy of Sciences have recently set off to Yunnan's Old Mountain Front to begin a one-year term of soldiering and substituting for officers.

This is a measure taken by the Military Academy of Sciences to enrich their military practical knowledge, improve their military qualities, and complete the transition from students to soldiers. Most of these researchers, who are experiencing their first deployment to a unit, have been assigned to combat squads, with a few substituting for junior officer positions. They will learn the spirit of selfless dedication from the border defense soldiers and cultivate the skills of hard work and border defense through joint training and duty with them.
