Mr. Okazaki celebrated his 90th birthday in Beijing last year in April. This year in May, he fulfilled his wish to visit China for the 100th time. In his letter in June, he wrote: "This 100th visit to China has left me with beautiful memories. I am very happy to have reunited with so many old friends and to have made many new ones." Just as he was preparing to take his 101st step to visit China for the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China, the news of his passing suddenly arrived. Gazing at the autumn sky in the east, I am filled with sorrow and remembrance, and the past keeps flooding back.

**A Close Friend of Premier Zhou**

Mr. Okazaki first visited China in October 1962 with Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke and others. During their first meeting, Premier Zhou spoke about Sino-Japanese relations, which left a deep impression on Mr. Okazaki. He often quoted these words in his memoirs and speeches. Premier Zhou said: "After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Japan invaded China for half a century, causing immense losses of life and property. Especially after the September 18th Incident, the damage was enormous. We have hatred. However, compared to the two thousand years of friendly history, this half-century of hatred is after all brief. We must strive to forget this hatred, and the peoples of the two countries must join hands to do good for Asia."

There was one incident that Mr. Okazaki never forgot. In August 1972, during Mr. Okazaki's visit to China, Premier Zhou invited him to come to Beijing during the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. On September 12 of the same year, when Premier Zhou met with Mr. Furui Yoshizumi and others, he did not see Mr. Okazaki and asked me: "Why wasn't he invited?" I said that Mr. Okazaki planned to come by chartered plane and that a report had been submitted for the Premier's approval. Premier Zhou criticized me for being a bureaucrat and instructed us to immediately call and invite Mr. Okazaki. That evening, Mr. Okazaki, who had just returned home from work in Tokyo, was deeply moved to receive a call from the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The next day, as soon as he received the invitation, he immediately boarded the chartered plane and rushed to Beijing. Before the arrival of Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei's delegation in Beijing, Premier Zhou specially took the time to have dinner with the personnel related to the memorandum trade between China and Japan. During the dinner, the Premier said: "The memorandum trade is about to end. Japanese friends have been running around for work for more than ten years. Has Mr. Okazaki been to the Three Gorges?" Mr. Okazaki said he had not. The Premier immediately instructed me to organize a visit to the Three Gorges, Guilin, and other places for Mr. Okazaki and his delegation during their next visit to express appreciation. At the end of the dinner, he repeatedly reminded us not to forget. The following year, in 1973, Mr. Okazaki led a delegation to Beijing and held talks with our side on concluding the memorandum trade. We then arranged for the Japanese friends to visit the Three Gorges, Guilin, and other places according to the Premier's instructions.

Premier Zhou's passing caused Mr. Okazaki immense grief. He came to Beijing to pay his respects at the memorial sites for the Premier, expressing his deep sorrow. However, the people's Premier has no grave or monument. Mr. Okazaki finally placed a bouquet of fresh flowers at the Monument to the People's Heroes at Tiananmen Square, praying silently for a long time before reluctantly leaving.

**Pioneer of the Memorandum Trade**

During the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, Premier Zhou proposed: "Do not forget old friends, welcome new friends, and never forget those who dug the wells." Mr. Okazaki was one of them.

In the 1960s, the Japanese side's memorandum trade office was always under Mr. Okazaki's leadership. Thus, he became the counterpart for negotiating annual agreements with me every year. In the 1960s, when diplomatic relations were not normal, our negotiations were quite arduous. Mr. Okazaki was both a businessman and a skilled negotiator. He often said that the friendship he built with me was "argued" out. We sometimes argued so intensely that our faces turned red and necks swelled. However, this "arguing" was always about presenting facts and reasoning, and it never escalated into a dispute. Instead, it fostered friendship. This was because both sides had a common goal: to develop economic and trade exchanges between the two countries through this semi-official, long-term, comprehensive trade method, and to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries. Mr. Okazaki believed that, considering the historical relationship and future of Japan and China, it was necessary to emphasize the economic and trade relations between the two countries, which was a beneficial endeavor with no drawbacks. The memorandum trade excluded political interference, facilitated the exchange of major products between the two sides, and established permanent commercial liaison offices and dispatched journalists. Mr. Okazaki also believed that this channel should not only exchange goods but, more importantly, facilitate the exchange of people. The 11 years of memorandum trade (1962-1973) were under his care that Japanese personnel related to the memorandum trade developed into hundreds of people. Including their families, they almost formed a "memorandum family." When the memorandum trade ended in 1973 due to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, Mr. Okazaki and others organized this "family" into a friendly "Awakening Friendship Association," which has visited China many times and remains active.

**Noble Aspiration**

After the end of the memorandum trade, Mr. Okazaki took on the role of permanent advisor to the Japan-China Economic Association, actively promoting the development of economic exchanges between Japan and China, and signed a long-term trade agreement with our side in 1978. In the 1980s, Mr. Okazaki highly praised China's reform and opening-up policy. He used his extensive connections in the Japanese economic circle to develop youth exchanges, technological exchanges, and the tourism industry with our relevant units. He once served as the president of "All Nippon Airways" and also helped establish new routes between "All Nippon Airways" and our civil aviation. He loved China's mountains and rivers so much that he climbed the Outer Eight Temples in Chengde despite his 80 years of age. He squeezed into a small van to travel for hours to see the Heavenly Lake on the Silk Road, showing no sign of fatigue. He recently often said that he had not been to Tibet yet. He wished he could travel all over China. He not only brought his grandchildren but also his fellow countrymen from Okayama Prefecture. The "Okazaki China Visit Group" became a regular customer of the China International Travel Service. Mr. Okazaki said this was to embody Premier Zhou's slogan: "The peoples of China and Japan should be friends forever."

Chairman Deng Xiaoping recently told Japanese friends: "Sino-Japanese friendship is very important, important for China, and important for Japan. Friendship benefits the peoples of both countries and is also beneficial for world peace and development. Regardless of changes in the international situation or changes within Japan and China, Sino-Japanese friendship cannot change and will not change. The friendship between China and Japan for generations to come is the wish of everyone."

Mr. Okazaki was a man who embodied this great aspiration. Although he has left us, the friendly cause he pursued unwaveringly will not change and will continue to develop.

　　中日友好事业的掘井人
　　——悼念冈崎嘉平太先生
　　刘希文
    冈崎老先生前年4月在北京度过90岁寿辰之后，今年5月又在北京实现访华100次的夙愿。他在6月来信中写道：“这第一百次的访华，给我留下美好的印象，我非常高兴能与许许多多的老朋友重聚，又能结识许多新的朋友。”正当新中国国庆四十周年冈崎先生准备迈出第101次访华步伐之际，却突然传来他去世的噩耗。遥望东方秋空，痛惜哀悼，往事不断涌上心头。周总理的挚友
    冈崎先生于1962年10月同高崎达之助先生等人首次访华，周总理在第一次会见时谈到中日关系的一段话，给冈崎先生留下很深的印象，他在回忆录和演讲时多次引述。周总理当时表明：甲午战争以后的半个世纪，日本侵略中国，造成生命财产的巨大损失。特别是“九一八”事变以后，损害很大。我们是有仇恨的。但是，半个世纪的仇恨同两千年的友好历史比较起来，毕竟是短暂的。我们要努力忘掉这段仇恨，两国人民携起手来，把亚洲的事办好。冈崎先生对此极为赞赏，并当即表示：日中两国要携起手来，为亚洲国家的独立和繁荣而共同努力。
    有一件使冈崎先生念念不忘的事。1972年8月，冈崎先生访华时，周总理曾请他在中日复交时来北京。同年9月12日，周总理会见古井喜实等人时，没看见冈崎先生，便问我：为什么没有邀请他来？我说，因冈崎先生拟坐包机来，已打报告，要等总理审批。周总理批评我是个文牍主义者，要我们立即打电话，邀请冈崎先生。当天，在东京刚下班回家的冈崎先生，接到北京人民大会堂打来的电话，十分感动。第二天，他一收到邀请电，便立即搭上包机赶来北京。在田中角荣首相一行到北京之前，周总理专门抽出时间同中日双方备忘录贸易有关人员共进晚餐。席间，总理说：备忘录贸易快结束了，日本朋友们十多年来总是为工作奔跑，不知冈崎先生到过三峡没有？冈崎先生说，还没去过。总理当即吩咐我在冈崎先生一行下次来访时，组织他们到三峡、桂林等地参观，以示慰劳。在晚餐结束时，还一再叮嘱不要忘了。第二年即1973年，冈崎先生率团来京，同我方就结束备忘录贸易事宜举行会谈后，我们就按照总理的指示，安排日本朋友们到三峡和桂林等地游览。
    周总理去世，使冈崎先生感到万分悲痛。他来到北京，要到纪念总理的地方祭奠，寄托无限的哀思。可是，人民的总理无墓无碑。冈崎先生最后捧了一束鲜花，献到天安门人民英雄纪念碑前，默祷良久，不忍离去。
    备忘录贸易的掘井人
    周总理在中日复交时提出：“不忘老朋友，欢迎新朋友，饮水不忘掘井人。”冈崎先生就是其中的一位。
    在60年代，日方备忘录贸易办事处一直由冈崎先生负责。于是，他成为每年同我谈判年度协议事项的对手。在邦交还不正常的60年代，我们每次的谈判都相当艰苦。冈崎先生是一位实业家，又是一位谈判能手。他后来常说，他同我建立的友谊是“吵”出来的。我们有时真是“吵”得脸红脖子粗。不过这个“吵”始终是摆事实，讲道理，不但没有“吵”翻，反而“吵”出友情来。这是因为双方都有一个共同的目标：通过这个半官方的、长期的、综合性的贸易方式，发展双方经济贸易来往，推动两国关系向正常化方向发展。冈崎先生认为，从日本和中国的历史关系和将来着眼，必须重视两国的经贸关系，这是有百益而无一害的事业。备忘录贸易排除政治干扰，沟通了双方主要产品的交易，并且实现互设常驻商务联络机构，互派记者。冈崎先生还认为，这个渠道不能只交换货物，更重要的是人的交流。11年的备忘录贸易（1962——1973），正是在他的关怀下，日本有关备忘录贸易人士才发展到数百人，加上他们的家属，几乎成为一种“备忘录大家族”。在1973年备忘录贸易因中日复交而宣告结束时，冈崎先生等把这个“大家族”组成为恳亲性质的“觉友会”，曾经组团访华，历久不衰。
      崇高的夙愿
      冈崎先生在备忘录贸易结束之后，又就任日中经济协会常任顾问，积极从事发展日中经济交流，并在1978年同我方签订了中日长期贸易协议。进入80年代，冈崎先生十分赞赏我国改革开放的方针，他运用在日本经济界的广泛联系，同我方各有关单位开展青年交流，技术交流，并发展旅游事业。他曾任“全日空”总经理，还促成了“全日空”同我民航建立新的航线。他是那样喜爱中国的山山水水，承德的外八庙，他不顾80岁的高龄奋力攀登；丝绸之路的天池，他挤在小面包车里颠簸几小时前往观赏，毫无倦意。他最近常说，还有一个西藏没去。他巴不得把整个中国都走遍。他不但带着孙子们，还带着故乡冈山县的乡亲们，“冈崎访华团”成为中国国际旅行社的常客。冈崎先生说，这是为了体现周总理提出的口号：中日两国人民要世世代代友好下去。
    邓小平主席最近对日本朋友说：“中日友好十分重要，对中国十分重要，对日本也十分重要。友好对两国人民有利，也对世界和平与发展有利。不管国际上有什么变化，也不管日本中国国内有什么变化，中日友好不能变，也不会变。中日两国世世代代友好下去，是大家的愿望。”
    冈崎老先生是对这个宏愿身体力行的人。他虽然离开我们，但是他为之笃行不渝的友好事业是不会变的，是会不断发展的。
