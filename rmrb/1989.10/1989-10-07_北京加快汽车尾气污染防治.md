	Beijing Speeds Up Control of Vehicle Exhaust Pollution

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th (Reporter Lai Yunchuan) After issuing the "Regulations on the Management of Motor Vehicle Exhaust Pollution Control" in September, Beijing today further deployed measures to accelerate the control of motor vehicle exhaust pollution.

	In recent years, the problem of motor vehicle exhaust pollution in Beijing has become increasingly serious. Statistics show that the city currently has 430,000 motor vehicles, and this number is increasing at an annual rate of 10%. About 50% of these vehicles emit exhaust that exceeds national standards.

	Mayor Chen Xitong of Beijing has required that automobile production, maintenance, and usage units, as well as individuals, actively cooperate with environmental protection and traffic management departments to accelerate the control of motor vehicle exhaust pollution. The goal is to achieve compliance with national emission standards for all vehicles within two to three years. He particularly emphasized that the effort should start from the municipal Party committee and government.

    北京加快汽车尾气污染防治
    据新华社北京10月5日电　（记者赖云川）北京市继9月发布《防治机动车排气污染管理办法》后，今天又部署加快机动车排气污染的防治步伐。
    近年来，北京机动车辆尾气污染问题日益严重。据统计，目前全市的机动车已达43万辆，并继续以每年10％的速度增加，这些车辆约有50％排放的尾气超过国家标准。
    北京市市长陈希同要求汽车生产、维修、使用单位和个人，积极与环保、交通管理部门配合，加快治理机动车辆尾气污染的步伐，争取在两三年内，使所有汽车尾气达到国家规定的排放标准。他特别要求从市委、市政府做起。
