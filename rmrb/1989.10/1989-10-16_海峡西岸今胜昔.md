Not long ago, the reporter spent more than half a month on the western shore of the Taiwan Strait, feeling most deeply that the former booming sound of cannons has been replaced by the sound of firecrackers at the opening of factories and shops; the former "Fujian Frontline" now has nearly 30 coastal open counties, cities, and districts, becoming the "window" for mainland China's opening to the outside world.

In the nearly 30 years since the founding of New China, the Taiwan Strait has been in a state of military standoff, and some places on the western shore have poor infrastructure and relatively backward economies. In the past decade, the mainland has implemented the policy of opening up to the outside world and revitalizing the domestic economy; the situation in the Taiwan Strait has shifted from standoff to easing, and in a short period of time, the western shore of the Taiwan Strait has undergone historic changes.

Few Lights—Thousands of Lights

Taiwan compatriot Lin returned to his hometown, Angmei Town, Dongshan Village in Longhai County, and was stunned when he saw the spider-web-like power lines and water pipes. Originally, he intended to bring back a television and a washing machine to give to his relatives. However, he heard in Taiwan that the coastal areas of the mainland had no electricity or water, so he did not bring the household appliances back.

Mr. Lin did not know that in the past ten years, nearly 5000 kilometers of high and low voltage power lines had been erected along the thousand-mile coast, and 47.2 kilometers of underwater cables had been laid. The western shore of the Taiwan Strait has lit up. It is said that on the Jinmen Island, which is occupied by the Nationalist Army, there is an observation deck. In the past, when night fell, some people from various circles in Taiwan, organized by the authorities, would climb up to this deck to look at the sparsely lit mainland shore. Now, if they climb up to look again, what will enter their eyes will be the lights of Xiamen, Longhai, Tong'an, Nan'an, Jinjiang, and other places.

Like Mr. Lin, many overseas relatives who return to visit their hometowns also feel that their hometowns have undergone unexpected changes. For example, the more than 100 coastal islands and protruding areas that have been short of water for many years have, due to the construction of 300 water plants and more than 1700 kilometers of water pipelines in the past ten years, allowed the water from the Minjiang, Jinjiang, Jiulongjiang, and 5 large reservoirs to flow in, not only initially solving the drinking water problem for more than 1.5 million people in these places, but also providing some water for agriculture and industry. Water and electricity have created conditions for the economic development of the western shore of the Taiwan Strait, allowing a large number of laborers to be freed from the original queue for water and manual processing of agricultural and sideline products, and to engage in planting and breeding, developing tourism, and other industries. Some villages have removed the "poor village" hat and begun to walk on the road to prosperity.

Sandstorms Everywhere—Green Trees Everywhere

During the reporter's visit to Dongshan County, he heard such a story: A Taiwan compatriot, Mr. Pan, whose ancestral home is Xipu Town in Dongshan County, specially brought back a packet of tree seeds to his long-separated hometown. Who would have thought that he was surrounded by a sea of trees, and everywhere he looked was green. Mr. Pan said to his fellow villagers with deep emotion, "I really don't know my hometown!"

In his memory, the island of Dongshan, surrounded by the sea on four sides, was a desolate island where "firewood was as precious as oil." According to the county annals, in the past hundred years, sand "tigers" ravaged, swallowing 13 villages, more than 1000 houses, and more than 30,000 mu of farmland.

The Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots who once suffered from sandstorms and left their hometowns are now stepping on the sand "tigers" that have been subdued and tasting the sweet fruits. How can they not be proud of the great power of the people of their ancestral land to transform nature!

Since the 1960s, Fujian Province has planted 1.54 million mu of various coastal protection forests, effectively subduing the invasion of sandstorms and waves, and rapidly developing various economic forests. A number of beach orchards and continuous asparagus export bases have also emerged.

Chencheng Township's Shankou Village, located at the windy end of the island, was once a famous "beggar village." Now, under the protection of more than 10 forest belts, every household grows asparagus, and Shankou Village has become a corner of the largest asparagus base in the country. Last year, the per capita income exceeded 10,000 yuan. In the past year, more than 30 Taiwan compatriots have returned to Shankou Village to visit relatives and travel, "It's changed, it's changed, it's changed so much that it's unrecognizable!" They have seen with their own eyes the two worlds before and after the founding of New China.

    海峡西岸今胜昔
    新华社记者　林斯定
    前不久，记者有过半个多月的台湾海峡西岸之行，感受最深的是：昔日的隆隆炮声，已被厂、店开业剪彩的鞭炮声所取代；当年的“福建前线”，如今有近30个沿海开放的县、市、区，成为大陆对外开放的“窗口”。
    新中国成立后的近30年间，台湾海峡一直处于军事对峙状态，海峡西岸一些地方基础设施差，经济比较落后。近十年来，大陆实行对外开放、对内搞活的方针；台湾海峡形势已由对峙趋于缓和，短短时间内，海峡西岸发生了历史性的变化。
  灯火稀疏——万家灯火
    台胞林先生回到阔别的故乡龙海县角美镇东山村，抬头望见那蛛网般的电线和自来水管时，愣住了。本来他是要带回电视机和洗衣机送给亲人的。可是他在台湾听说大陆沿海没电没水，就没把家用电器带回来。
    林先生哪里知道，过去十年间，千里海岸先后架起近5000公里的高、低压输电线路，铺设了47.2公里的海底电缆，海峡西岸已经亮起来了。据悉，在国民党军队占据的金门岛上有座观望台，以前夜晚来临，时不时有些被当局组织来的台湾各界人士登上此台，眺望灯火稀疏的大陆彼岸。如今若再登临远眺，映入眼帘的将是厦门、龙海、同安、南安、晋江等地的万家灯火。
    像林先生一样，许多探亲的海外游子都觉得家乡发生了意想不到的变化。比如，那常年缺水的100多个沿海岛屿和突出部，由于近十年来修建了300座自来水厂和1700多公里输水管道，使闽江、晋江、九龙江及5座大型水库的水源源注入，不仅初步解决了这些地方150多万群众饮水问题，还能提供部分工农业用水。水和电，为海峡西岸经济发展创造了条件，使大批劳力由原来排队等水、靠体力加工农副产品中解脱出来，转行从事种养业、开发旅游业等。一些乡村摘掉“特困乡”帽子，开始走上了富裕道路。
    风沙漫天——绿树成荫
    记者在东山县采访时，听到这样一个故事：祖籍是东山县西埔镇的台胞潘先生，特地采集了一包树籽带回阔别的家乡。谁曾想他却身居林海，举目皆绿。潘先生感慨万千地对乡亲们说，“我对家乡太不了解了！”
    在他的记忆里，四面环海的东山岛是一个“柴草贵如油”的荒凉海岛。据县志记载，近百年间，沙“虎”肆虐，吞噬了13个村庄、1000多间民房、3万多亩农田。
    当年深受风沙之害而离乡背井的港、澳、台胞，脚踩已被制伏的沙“虎”，品尝甜蜜的果实时，怎能不为祖籍地人民改造大自然的伟大力量而自豪！
    自60年代开始，福建全省营造了154万亩各种沿海防护林，有效地制伏了风沙和海浪的侵袭，多种经济林得以迅速发展，并已出现一批沙滩果园和连片芦笋等创汇基地。
    地处全岛风口的陈城乡山口村，是远近有名的“乞丐村”。现在，在10多条林带的庇护下，户户种芦笋，山口村已成为全国最大芦笋基地的一角，去年户均收入超万元。一年多来，先后有30多位台胞回山口村探亲旅游，“变了，变了，变得都认不出来了！”他们亲眼看到了新中国成立前后的两个世界。
