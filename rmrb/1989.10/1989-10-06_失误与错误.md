Title: Mistakes and Errors

Mistakes and errors both fall under the category of mistakes and are both types of errors. This is their similarity. The difference lies in the fact that mistakes are often caused by carelessness and low proficiency, while errors, in addition to carelessness and low proficiency, are also due to cognitive biases. Cognitive biases, aside from being limited by one's ideological level, do not exclude the possibility of deliberate wrongdoing. In summary, mistakes are more about objective conditions, while errors are more about subjective factors.

In practice, people generally have no difficulty understanding and grasping the distinction between mistakes and errors. For example, in a sports competition, whether it's playing a ball game, chess, or wrestling, athletes all strive forward, but often fail, losing their chance to win and giving the opponent the opportunity to win. This failure is a mistake. Generally, no one would call such a mistake an error. If a coach gives incorrect instructions or a referee makes an incorrect judgment, violating the facts or going against the rules, that is an error. Because errors are often caused by subjective factors, people usually say, "Someone made an error," rather than "Someone made a mistake."

Mistakes are easily understood and forgiven, while errors often provoke dissatisfaction and anger. For those who have made serious errors and caused certain consequences, if they are not disciplined by party regulations, administrative regulations, or criminal law, it would not be enough to satisfy public outrage. This is the reason.

Perhaps for this reason, people often attribute deviations in work or uncompleted tasks to mistakes. Among these, some are genuine mistakes, while others are not. Some people clearly made errors but use mistakes as an excuse to cover up their wrongdoings. Mistakes become a shield for some people. Once the shield is raised, the error slips away.

Perhaps for this reason, the term "mistake" is used more frequently and seems more fashionable and lighthearted compared to the term "error."

In this turmoil that escalated into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, some people clearly made errors, causing significant losses to the party's cause and creating a terrible influence among the people. However, they dare not even admit to making an error, instead using the term "mistake" to excuse and evade responsibility. They say things like, "This was a major mistake," or "Due to my mistake, the people misunderstood," or "Because the objective situation was unclear, mistakes were inevitable." They think they are being very clever, but others have long grown tired of hearing it. It is like being on the battlefield, where one's gun is not aimed at the enemy but at one's own camp. As a member of the Communist Party and a revolutionary cadre, to conspire with those who attempt to overthrow the party and socialism is absurd. Such people still dare to talk about "mistakes" in a brazen manner, which is utterly ridiculous!

Of course, if it is indeed a mistake, one should not force it to be considered an error. For example, in carrying out reforms and opening up, things that previous generations have not done, everything has to be done by feeling one's way. It is inevitable to make some mistakes in certain matters. Forcing a mistake to be considered an error not only does not solve the problem but also hurts comrades. Similarly, calling an error a mistake, downplaying the seriousness of the error, is also not beneficial to the person who made the error. It may even allow bad elements to slip away.

When one makes an error, one must have an honest attitude, first admit the error, and then recognize and correct it. If one tries to evade responsibility under the shield of "mistake" from the start, how can one correct the error and avoid or reduce making errors in the future?

### 失误与错误

    失误与错误
    吴昊
    失误与错误，都属于误，都是差错。这是两者相同点。不同点在于，失误多是由于疏忽和水平不高造成的；错误的造成，除了疏忽和水平不高外，还有认识上的偏差；而认识上的偏差，除了同样受思想水平的限制外，并不排除明知故犯的成份。总之，失误偏重于客观条件，错误则偏重于主观原因。
    对于失误与错误的界限，人们在实践中并不难理解和掌握。比如运动员在比赛场上，打球、下棋、摔跤等，彼此都奋力向前，但又常常失利，使自己失掉取胜的机会，给对方造成得胜的机会，这种失利就是失误。在一般情况下，谁也不会把这种失误说成错误。如果是教练员指挥失当，裁判员判断不妥，违背了事实，或有悖于规则，那就是错误。正因为错误多是主观因素造成的，所以人们总是说：“某某犯了错误”，而不说：“某某犯了失误”。
    失误容易被人理解和原谅，错误则往往引起人的不满和激愤；对于一些错误严重，又造成一定后果的人，有时不给予党纪、政纪或刑事的处理，就不足以平民愤，道理就在这里。
    大概正因为如此，人们常把工作中的偏差、或任务没有完成，说是由于失误造成的。这当中有的是真失误，有的是假失误；有的人明明是犯了错误却以失误来开脱、搪塞，失误成了某些人手里的盾牌。举起盾牌，错误就溜之乎也了。
    大概正因为如此，失误一词的使用比错误一词的作用，显得既时髦又轻率，既走俏又温情。
    在这一次动乱到反革命暴乱中，有些人明明是犯了错误，给党的事业造成了重大损失，在群众中造成了极坏的影响，但却连错误二字也不敢说，只拿失误来开脱、敷衍，什么“这是一次重大的失误”呀，什么“由于我的失误造成群众的误解”呀，什么“客观情况不明，失误在所难免”呀，自己觉得聪明至极，别人却早已听得不耐烦了。就像在两军阵前，自己的枪不是向敌人射击，而是向自己的营垒射击。身为共产党员和革命干部的人，竟同企图推翻党、推翻社会主义的人图谋不轨，这样的人居然还在大言不惭地谈“失误”，岂不是滑天下之大稽！
    当然，如果确实是失误，也不要硬往错误上拉。像搞改革开放这样前人没有做过的事情，一切都要摸着石头过河，在某些事情上有所失误，确是难免的。把失误硬说成错误，不仅于事无补，还会伤害同志；同样，把错误说成失误，对犯错误的人，大事化小，小事化了，也于事无补，这样对犯错误的同志也不利，甚至还会让坏人悄悄溜掉。
    犯了错误，要有老实的态度，先要承认错误，尔后才能认识错误和改正错误。如果一出场就企图在“失误”的盾牌下溜号，那还怎么能改正错误和避免以后不再犯错误或少犯错误呢！
