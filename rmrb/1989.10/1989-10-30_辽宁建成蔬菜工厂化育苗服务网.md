Liaoning Province has established a network of factory-based vegetable seedling services that covers the entire province. This network was built through the collaborative efforts of agricultural management, agricultural education, and agricultural research over the past three years.

The construction of Liaoning's factory-based vegetable seedling service network began in 1987. Over the past three years, 754 factory-based seedling centers have been established, providing 350 million commercial vegetable seedlings annually. This year, the area cultivated with seedlings provided by this service network accounts for 46.1% of the province's total spring and summer vegetable planting area.
