Column: Book Review Notes

Works titled "Ji Shi" (Records of Events) that compile extensive records of poetry and related events from a particular era include "Tang Shi Ji Shi" by Ji Yougong of the Southern Song Dynasty and "Qing Shi Ji Shi Chu Bian" by Deng Zhicheng of modern times. These works, when combined, form a complete system and constitute a small category within classical literature. "Qing Shi Ji Shi Chu Bian" is meticulously annotated and academically superior to previous works, but it only covers the reigns of the Shunzhi and Kangxi emperors and directly selects poems from various individual collections, making it general and lacking specific context. To complement and continue the tradition of poetry records from previous dynasties, Professor Qian Zhonglian and the Ming and Qing Poetry and Prose Research Institute of Suzhou University have compiled a monumental work of 120 million words, "Qing Shi Ji Shi." This book has been published by Jiangsu Ancient Books Publishing House.

Excluding ghost poems, dream poems, and folk songs, "Qing Shi Ji Shi" lists 6,470 poets. For each poet, the book first provides a biographical sketch, followed by a comprehensive evaluation. The breadth of the collected materials and the depth of the evaluations are unparalleled in similar works.

Chinese classical poetry has traditionally emphasized "expressing one's intentions" and "following one's emotions." Before the Qing Dynasty, there were few authors of long narrative poems, and each author produced few such works. This book not only supplements materials from collected works but also, more importantly, extracts poems and event records from over 1,000 sources such as poetry and word discussions, notes, novels, diaries, and letters. Major events of the ten dynasties are often reflected in poetry. The abundance of works, the breadth of themes, and the scale of the pieces have reached an unprecedented level. Using poetry to discuss politics and reflect reality became a trend in the Qing poetry world. In the absence of a comprehensive collection of Qing poetry, "Qing Shi Ji Shi" plays an undeniable role in reviewing the unique achievements of Qing poetry, specifically its narrative nature, to establish its proper place in Chinese poetry history.

As the last feudal dynasty in China, the Qing Dynasty experienced unprecedented social changes, sharp class conflicts, and intense ethnic struggles. People transformed these turbulent times into literature. This is the objective reason why narrative poetry thrived in the Qing Dynasty. However, "Qing Shi Ji Shi" also reveals that in the Qing Dynasty, especially in the late Qing, poems intended to record events often failed to do so. Some works have annotations that exceed the main body of the poem by several times or even tens of times. The complexity of the poem's content and the poet's inability to fully express their intentions prove that the later poetry reform was a necessary historical trend. It can be said that Qing poetry records represent the peak of such works in history and are also the last glimmer of the entire feudal society. "Qing Shi Ji Shi" has faithfully and objectively recorded this literary development trajectory.

　　读《清诗纪事》
　　黄希坚
    以“纪事”命名，广罗一代诗歌纪事文献勒成巨帙行世的，有南宋计有功的《唐诗纪事》和近人邓之诚的《清诗纪事初编》等。这些著作前后衔接，自成体系，构成古籍中的一个小类别。《清诗纪事初编》考订精确，学术性自高出前人，但它仅选顺治、康熙两朝，并直接采诗于各家别集，笼统而无特定背景。为同历代诗纪事配套承接，钱仲联教授及其领导下的苏州大学明清诗文研究室编纂了洋洋1200万言的
  《清诗纪事》。此书已由江苏古籍出版社出版。
    除鬼诗梦诗和民歌谣谚，《清诗纪事》共列6470家。每家之首先为诗人简历，后为诗人总论。总论部分搜罗之广博，评论之详尽，实为同类著作所未有。
    中国古典诗歌创作历来以“言志”、“缘情”为传统。清代以前，中长篇叙事诗作者代不数人，人不数作。本书除从总集、别集中补充材料，更主要的从1000余种如诗话词话、笔记小说、日记尺牍等文献中采摘诗歌作品和纪事资料，十朝大事往往在诗中得到表现。作品之多，题材之广，篇制之巨，达到了前所未有的水平。以诗歌叙说时政、反映现实成为有清诗坛的风气。在清诗尚未勒成总集的情况下，通过检阅清诗的独特成就即叙事性以确立它在中国诗歌史上的恰当地位，《清诗纪事》的作用是无可怀疑的。
    作为中国最后一个封建王朝，清代社会生活的巨变，阶级矛盾之尖锐，民族冲突之激烈，为历代所未有。人们用笔墨将这种变幻风云化为文字。这是清代叙事诗之所以兴旺发达的客观原因。但从《清诗纪事》也不难发现，清代特别是晚清的诗，其用以纪事的诗歌竟不能纪事，有的作品的夹注超过诗歌本体几倍甚至几十倍。诗歌内容的繁复和诗人的力不从心，证明了后来的诗体革命正是历史发展的必然趋势。可以说，清代诗歌纪事是历史上这种同类作品的发展顶峰，也是整个封建社会的回光返照。对这条文学发展史的轨迹，《清诗纪事》忠实而客观地作了记录。
