    The deputy procurator-general of Hubei Province, Dong Liangcai, recently told a reporter that as the deadline set by the "Two Highs" (the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate) approaches, Hubei Province has seen a phenomenon where one person's surrender leads to a chain of others turning themselves in.

    In Gong'an County, the Fuel and Chemical Company has 50 employees. After the issuance of the "Notice," 18 people went to the county procuratorate to confess their economic crimes, with a total crime amount of 560,000 yuan. In Xianning County, the Cotton Company's sales manager, Wang Hanming, recently took 126,000 yuan in illicit funds to the county procuratorate to surrender himself. After his surrender, four more people from the same company turned themselves in. In Hanyang County, the manager of the Young Drug Materials Row, Zhou Xiang, and the business employee of the Wholesale Department, Zhou Peichun, surrendered themselves. Following their surrender, four more people from the same company turned themselves in.
