Prosecutors have handled over 70,000 cases of embezzlement and bribery this year, with a number of major cases currently under investigation and showing progress.

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 25th - Today, Liu Fuzhi, the Prosecutor General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the work of the procuratorate in combating embezzlement and bribery. He said that from January to September this year, procuratorates across the country accepted 71,055 cases of embezzlement and bribery, an increase of 1.2 times compared to the same period last year (32,487 cases); 35,797 cases have been filed for investigation, an increase of 1.3 times compared to the same period last year (15,861 cases).

He said that among the cases filed for investigation, there were 22,265 cases of embezzlement, an increase of 79% compared to the same period last year; and 13,532 cases of bribery, an increase of 2.9 times compared to the same period last year. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of September, 13,211 embezzlement and bribery criminals had been decided to be arrested, and 11,244 had been prosecuted by the people's courts. A total of 218.43 million yuan in embezzled money and property had been recovered, an increase of 41% compared to the same period last year.

He said that in the fight against embezzlement and bribery crimes, there have been breakthroughs in the investigation of major and important cases. According to statistics, from January to September this year, procuratorates across the country filed 5,894 cases of embezzlement and bribery involving amounts over 10,000 yuan, accounting for 22% of the total number of cases filed, an increase of 2.2 times compared to the same period last year; 496 cases of embezzlement and bribery involving county-level and above officials have been filed for investigation, an increase of 50% compared to the same period last year. Among these, there are 25 bureau-level officials (8 in the whole of last year) and 1 ministerial-level official.

Liu Fuzhi said that currently, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and relevant provincial and municipal procuratorates are investigating a number of major and important cases. For example, based on a report from a citizen in Shanghai, the case of Cao Bin, former Deputy Director of the Propaganda Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (at the bureau level), was discovered. The case has been filed for investigation, and Cao has been taken into custody. Based on the investigation of the case of Pan Kemin, former Deputy Director of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, and others using the power to allocate railway cars for embezzlement, bribery, and speculation, it was found that Xu Jun, former Director of the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, also had serious embezzlement and bribery issues, with some crime amounts reaching tens of millions of yuan. Pan Kemin and others formed a pact to evade punishment after the case was discovered. The main criminals have been arrested, and the investigation is ongoing. One notable feature of investigating major and important cases is that they often start from the bottom and follow the clues upwards, uncovering a series of related cases.

He said that in addition, there have been some achievements in investigating cases where power, especially the power to manage personnel, finances, and materials, and the power to approve matters, is used for criminal activities. At the same time, the efficiency and quality of case handling have also improved.

　　检察机关今年受理贪污贿赂案七万余件
　　一批大案目前正在查处并有所突破
    新华社北京10月25日电　最高人民检察院检察长刘复之今天在向全国人大常委会报告检察机关反贪污、贿赂斗争情况报告时说，今年1至9月，全国检察机关共受理贪污、贿赂案件71055件，比去年同期的32487件增加1.2倍；已立案侦查35797件，比去年同期的15861件增加1.3倍。
    他说，在立案查处的案件中，贪污案22265件，比去年同期增加79％；贿赂案13532件，比去年同期增加2.9倍。据不完全统计，到9月底，已决定逮捕贪污、贿赂犯罪分子13211人，已向人民法院提起公诉11244人，追缴赃款赃物计人民币2.1843亿元，比去年同期增加41％。
    他说，在反贪污、贿赂犯罪斗争中，查处大案、要案有所突破。据统计，今年1至9月，全国检察机关立案的万元以上贪污、受贿大案5894件，占全部贪污、贿赂案立案数的22％，比去年同期增加2.2倍；已立案查处的县以上干部贪污、贿赂案496件，比去年同期增加50％，其中司局级干部有25名（去年全年8名），省部级干部1名。
    刘复之说，目前，最高人民检察院与有关省、市检察院正在查处一批大案、要案。如：根据上海一公民的举报，查出中共中央宣传部宣传局原常务副局长曹斌（正局级）受贿案，现已立案侦查，对曹已采取强制措施；根据对郑州铁路局副局长潘克明以及局长等人利用调拨车皮之权进行贪污、受贿、投机倒把案的侦查，发现铁道部运输局原局长徐俊等人也有严重贪污、受贿问题，有的犯罪金额多达十几万元。潘克明等在案发后订立攻守同盟，企图逃避制裁。现已将主要案犯逮捕，正在深入侦查。查处大案、要案有一个明显的特点，就是往往自下而上，顺藤摸瓜，查一案，上下左右带出一串。
    他说，此外，查处利用权力，特别是利用人、财、物的管理权和审批权进行犯罪的案件取得一定成效。同时，办案效率和办案质量也有了提高。
