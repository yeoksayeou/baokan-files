China's October is like a radiant sun, its blazing light warming the hearts of hundreds of millions of people!

Forty years ago, when the ceremonial cannon of the founding ceremony roared like thunder across the vast sky, it swept away the gloom of history.

Forty years ago, when a giant hand pressed the button, a brand-new five-star red flag rose like a magnificent dawn, and China's long night came to an end.

Forty years ago, when the words "People's Republic of China" became the headline of newspapers around the world, the Chinese people stood up!

Oh, China's October.

The sunshine of October is a light saturated with immense energy, a light that embodies truth and justice.

Although every day in New China is not always sunny, sometimes it is overcast, the sunshine of October will never be obscured. On the contrary, after a heavy rainstorm, the sunshine of October in China becomes even more brilliant and vibrant.

Oh, the sun of October, it is you who have combined all of China into a colorful mosaic.

Under the sunshine of October, there are flocks of pigeons cooing, days filled with radiant colors, and hearty laughter...

Oh, the sunshine of October, I open my heart to embrace you, like a blade of grass, a small flower, excitedly kissing you, wishing that your shining feet may traverse the 9.6 million square kilometers of the republic, illuminating the new journey of building modernization and revitalizing China...

National Day Fireworks

Red and green light feathers soar in the sky with a puffing sound;

Yellow and blue rockets shoot up from the ground with a whooshing sound, accompanied by a series of laughter and bursts of emotional brilliance...

Oh, fireworks, fireworks!

Beams of light shoot towards the sky and instantly scatter.

They scatter into showers of colorful flowers;

They scatter into grains of stars from the Milky Way;

They scatter into seeds of light...

One by one, are these open umbrellas? No, umbrellas are not as magical. Cluster by cluster, are these blooming golden chrysanthemums? No, golden chrysanthemums are not as magnificent.

From the three-dimensional, multi-layered interplay of light arcs and circles, I seem to see the wings of our motherland taking flight... Oh, October, how many stars burn for you, how many rays of light gather for you!

For this day, how many martyrs have sacrificed their lives and blood; for this day, how many successors have fought all their lives!

The night of National Day is a night of revelry. The entire sky of China is illuminated, turned red, becoming a vast cavity of light, nurturing the future of China, a brilliant century...

    十月的阳光
    （外一章）
    陈文和
    中国的十月，像一轮辉煌的太阳，那赤炽的光焰，温暖着亿万人民的心窝！
    40年前，当开国大典的礼炮，像巨雷滚过万里长空时，把历史的阴霾也扫除了。
    40年前，当一只巨手按动了电钮，一面崭新的五星红旗，像一片绚丽的朝霞冉冉升起时，中国的漫漫长夜便从此结束了。
    40年前，当“中华人民共和国”这几个大字化做报纸的特大号标题，飞遍全世界时，中国人民便从此站立起来了！
    呵，中国的十月。
    十月的阳光，是饱和着巨大热能的光，凝聚着真理的光，正义的光。
    尽管新中国的每一张日历，不全都是风和日丽，有时还阴云密布，但十月的阳光是不会被掩没的。相反，当一阵大雷雨过后，中国的十月的阳光，就变得更加鲜亮、绚丽。
    呵，十月的太阳，是你把神州的一切，组合成斑斓的色块。
    在十月的阳光下，有成群的鸽子的哨音，有流光溢彩的日子，有响亮的笑声……
    呵，十月的阳光，我敞开心室拥抱你，像一棵小草、一朵小花那么兴奋地亲吻你，愿你那闪光的足踝，走遍共和国960万平方公里的土地，照亮建设四化、振兴中华的新征程……
    国庆礼花
    红的、绿的光羽，在空中噗噗地腾飞；
    黄的、蓝的火箭，从地上嗖嗖地窜起，夹带起一串串笑的哗响，迸射出一束束情的白炽……
    呵，礼花，礼花！
    支支光箭射向天幕，霎地又散落了。
    散落成阵阵彩色的花雨；
    散落成颗颗银河的星粒；
    散落成粒粒光的种籽……
    一朵朵，这是张开的花伞么？不，花伞哪有它这样神奇。一簇簇，这是绽开的金菊么？不，金菊哪有它这样华丽。
    从那立体的、多层次的光弧与光圈的交织中，我仿佛看到了祖国起飞的亮翅……呵，十月，多少星星向你燃烧，多少霞光向你汇聚！
      为了这一天，多少先烈付出了生命与热血；为了这一天，多少后来者战斗了一辈子！
      国庆之夜是狂欢之夜，整个神州的天穹，被照亮了，被照红了，成了个偌大的光明的腹腔，它正孕育着未来的中国，灿烂的世纪……
