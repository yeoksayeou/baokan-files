In the afternoon of the 6th, two young people from Myanmar hijacked a domestic passenger plane to Thailand.

Under the directive of Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan to proceed with caution, Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit boarded the plane and engaged in lengthy negotiations with the hijackers. Finally, the hijackers agreed that if the Thai side publicly announced their seven political demands, they would release all the hostages. Chavalit agreed to this request. At 2:45 AM on the 7th, more than 50 hostages, including four crew members, were safely released from the plane. The hijackers surrendered to the Thai military at 4:20 AM on the 7th and left the plane.

    缅甸客机被劫事件已解决
    六日下午，缅甸两名青年将一架本国客机劫持到泰国。
    在泰国总理差猜·春哈旺发出谨慎行事的指示下，副总理天猜登上飞机与劫机者进行长时间的谈判。最后，劫机者同意，如果泰国方面公开发表他们提出的七点政治要求，他们将释放所有人质。天猜答应了这一要求。七日早二时四十五分，留在机上的五十多名人质，包括四名机组人员，全部安全获释，劫机者在七日早上四时二十分向泰国军方投降，离开了飞机。
