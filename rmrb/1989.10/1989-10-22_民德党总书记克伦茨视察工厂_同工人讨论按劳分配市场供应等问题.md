The newly elected General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Krenz, visited a machine tool factory in Berlin on October 19th and spoke with the workers.

Krenz told the workers, "The happiness of the German Democratic Republic largely depends on whether you have enthusiasm and dedication, and whether you understand the political responsibilities you bear." They discussed issues such as distribution according to work and market supply. Krenz answered the questions raised by the workers.

On the same day, Krenz also met with Werner Leich, the chairman of the Protestant Church in the Democratic Republic and the national bishop.

During the meeting, Krenz pointed out that the 9th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee was a turning point. It requires creating an atmosphere of openness, seriousness, and constructiveness through a common dialogue involving all aspects of society to solve the problems currently facing the Democratic Republic.

Krenz and Leich both believed that the church and all sectors of society should jointly protect the German Democratic Republic. To this end, mutual respect and trust are necessary.

    新华社柏林10月19日电  新当选的德国统一社会党中央总书记克伦茨19日视察了柏林的一家机床厂，并同工人们谈话。
    克伦茨对工人们说，“德意志民主共和国的幸福与否在很大程度上取决于你们有无热情与献身精神，能否认识到你们所担负的政治责任”。他们讨论了按劳分配、市场供应等问题。克伦茨回答了工人们提出的问题。
    同一天，克伦茨还会见了民主德国新教教会主席、全国大主教维尔纳·莱希。
    会见时，克伦茨指出，党的11届9中全会是一个转折点，它要求通过进行涉及社会各方面问题的共同对话，来创造坦诚、认真和建设性的气氛，以解决民主德国当前面临的问题。
    克伦茨和莱希都认为，教会和社会各阶层要共同保护德意志民主共和国，为此要互相尊重、互相信任。
