	Strive to Master Marxist Thought as a Weapon to Guide Reform and Construction
	Qinhuangdao Leaders Emphasize Learning and Applying Philosophy

	BEIJING — Reporter Chen Guoqí reports: Since April this year, the Qinhuangdao Municipal Committee of Hebei Province has organized various levels of leadership, especially county-level and above cadres, to seriously study Marxist philosophy. They aim to make philosophy a sharp ideological weapon for leaders to guide reform and construction, thereby promoting the scientific and democratic decision-making process.

	In organizing the study, the Qinhuangdao Municipal Committee focused on four aspects around the theme of "practicing what is learned."

	Self-study combined with strict assessment to make learning a regular practice. Currently, the Municipal Party School has completed one training session, with 31 county-level cadres participating in the study. The Municipal Committee emphasized strict assessment, including the learning status and theoretical level of cadres as important content and basis for their evaluation, promotion, and use.

	Learning basic viewpoints combined with studying key articles to build a solid theoretical foundation. Based on understanding the basic system of Marxist philosophy, the focus is on learning ten major basic viewpoints, including materialism, connection and development, contradiction, practice, the decisive role of productive forces, reform as an important driving force, class struggle, social consciousness, the masses, and systems theory. In systematic learning, there is a planned reading of some original works by Marx, Lenin, Mao Zedong, and relevant works by Deng Xiaoping, combined with refuting bourgeois liberalization views and reviewing the practice of reform and opening up, to deepen the understanding of basic viewpoints.

	Theory combined with practice to focus on solving practical problems. In the study, leaders and theoretical workers were organized to research and discuss the "hot" issues in reform, such as prices, clean governance, and unfair distribution, and to analyze and reflect on them from a theoretical height.

	Leaders' study combined with the masses' study to promote each other. While organizing the study for leading cadres, the Municipal Committee entrusted the Party School and other units to compile philosophy textbooks for workers and peasants. Philosophy principle lectures were held in newspapers, radio, and television, and a philosophy learning section was opened to guide the masses to learn basic philosophical viewpoints.

	The Qinhuangdao Municipal Committee's organization of leading cadres to study Marxist philosophy has not been long, but it has achieved initial results.

	First, using scientific analysis methods to understand the situation has stabilized the overall situation in the city. After the turmoil in Beijing affected this city, the Municipal Committee and various levels of leadership used scientific methods to analyze the situation. They guided students with extreme words and actions to see the mainstream of reform and opening up, to see through the phenomenon to the essence, and to correct the standpoint and methods of observing problems. Subsequently, from the philosophical height, they exposed the counter-revolutionary nature of the riot, raising the awareness of cadres and the masses.

	Second, using a systematic viewpoint to oversee the overall situation has promoted the deepening of reform and opening up and rectification and rectification. To do a good job in rectification and rectification, the Municipal Committee and Municipal Government, based on the dialectical materialist view of universal connection and systems theory, analyzed various complex factors constraining and affecting rectification and rectification. Starting from strengthening and improving the macro-control mechanism and eliminating chaotic phenomena in the circulation field, they formulated or improved more than 80 supporting measures.

	Third, using the viewpoint of seeking truth from facts to analyze contradictions and solve the main problems in their units. Qinhuangdao Port is the second-largest port in the country. The leadership of the Port Bureau, in their study, seriously analyzed the favorable and unfavorable factors in the port's development. They believed that being limited to energy transshipment could not adapt to the development of the situation. Therefore, they formulated a development plan to transform from an energy export port to an outward-looking comprehensive port. Since the implementation of this plan, the port has not only increased its energy export capacity but also increased its capacity for general cargo transportation.

	Fourth, adhering to the mass viewpoint has promoted clean governance and democratic decision-making. Studying historical materialism has strengthened the mass viewpoint and service awareness of many leading cadres, and various public and supervisory systems have been further improved.

　　努力掌握马克思主义思想武器指导改革和建设
　　秦皇岛各级领导重视学哲学用哲学
    本报石家庄电　记者陈国琦报道：今年4月份以来，河北省秦皇岛市委组织各级领导班子特别是县以上领导干部，认真学习马克思主义哲学，让哲学成为领导干部指导改革和建设的锐利思想武器，推进了领导决策的科学化民主化。
    秦皇岛市委在组织学习中，围绕“实”字，着重抓了4个方面的结合。
    自觉学习同严格考核相结合，使学习逐步经常化。目前市委党校已轮训一期，31名县级干部参加了学习。市委强调严格考核，把干部的学习状况、理论水平列为考察、提拔、使用的重要内容和依据。
    学习基本观点和学习重点文章相结合，着力打好理论根底。在弄清马克思主义哲学基本体系的基础上，着重学习唯物、联系和发展、矛盾、实践、生产力决定作用、改革是重要动力、阶级斗争、社会意识、群众、系统论等10大基本观点。在系统学习中，有计划地读一些马列、毛泽东的原著及邓小平的有关著述，并结合对资产阶级自由化观点的批驳和对改革开放实践的回顾，加深对基本观点的理解。
    理论和实践相结合，着眼于解决实际问题。在学习中，联系物价、廉政、分配不公等改革中的“热点”问题，组织领导干部和理论工作者研究探讨，从理论高度分析和反思。
    领导学习和群众学习相结合，互相促进。在组织领导干部学习的同时，市委责成党校等单位，编写了工人、农民学哲学教材，在报纸、电台、电视台举办哲学原理讲座，开辟学哲学园地，引导广大群众学习基本哲学观点。
    秦皇岛市委组织领导干部学习马克思主义哲学时间不长，收到了初步效果。
    一是用科学分析方法认识形势，稳定了全市大局。北京发生的动乱波及这个市后，市委和各级领导用科学的方法分析形势，引导有过激言行的学生看改革开放主流，透过现象看本质，把观察问题的立足点和思想方法搞正确。之后，又从哲学高度揭露暴乱的反革命本质，提高了干部和群众的认识。
    二是用系统观点统揽全局，推动了改革开放和治理整顿的深化。为搞好治理整顿，市委、市政府根据唯物辩证法关于普遍联系的观点和系统论原理，分析了制约影响治理整顿的各种复杂因素，从加强和完善宏观调控机制、消除流通领域混乱现象入手，制定或完善了80多项配套措施。
    三是用实事求是观点分析矛盾，解决本单位存在的主要问题。秦皇岛港是全国第二大港。港务局领导在学习中认真分析了港口发展中的有利条件和不利因素，认为局限于中转能源为主难以适应形势的发展。于是制定了由能源输出港转变为外向型综合港的发展规划。该规划实施以来，港口不仅增加了能源输出能力，而且增加了杂货运输能力。
    四是坚持群众观点，推动了廉政建设和决策民主化。学习唯物史观，不少领导干部增强了群众观点和服务意识，各项公开、监督制度进一步完善。
