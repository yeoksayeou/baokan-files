The elders of Dexing County, Jiangxi, have passed down a saying from generation to generation: "There are treasures in Wujiji Mountain!"

Experts from the geological survey department have scientifically proven that "Wujiji Mountain is rich in marble deposits."

However, the local people, who have been planting and cutting trees for eight generations, never dreamed of developing the underground treasures within their forest area.

At the end of 1987, Yu Wenshen, the director of the Dexing County Forestry Bureau, attended a meeting in Beijing convened by the Ministry of Forestry. The Minister of Forestry proposed six reform measures, one of the most important being the requirement for forestry departments at all levels to establish a concept of three-dimensional development, leverage the advantages of forest resources, and develop multi-level, multi-variety forestry economy.

Yu Wenshen was captivated, "To develop a large-scale forestry industry and three-dimensional development, Dexing County has unique advantages!"

Upon returning from the meeting in Beijing, Yu Wenshen convened a bureau meeting to analyze the favorable conditions for developing mineral resources and decided to establish a marble factory. The design plan was quickly approved. The first difficulty encountered in setting up the factory was funding. At that time, the prices of building materials were rising, the foreign exchange rate was appreciating, and domestic matching equipment was also increasing in price... In addition to investments from the ministry and province, 4.31 million yuan still needed to be raised internally.

The office of the Forestry Bureau was filled with smoke. After much deliberation, the bureau leaders made a decision. First, the entire bureau would tighten expenses to ensure the construction of the key project, the marble factory; second, internal and external debts would be cleared, and personnel would be organized to recover debts from external units; third, loans would be sought from provincial-owned enterprises and banks to operate with debt. To engage in industry and create a new situation, one must take risks.

The employees of the Forestry Bureau mobilized from all directions, and the money was finally secured. Two production lines imported from Italy also arrived in Shanghai. To save costs, they went to Shanghai to pull the equipment themselves. With no loaders, they personally tied the equipment onto the truck. The 500-plus boxes of abrasives were packaged in cardboard, making it impossible to lift them with a crane. Yu Wenshen rolled up his sleeves and started loading the truck himself. Like a silent command, more than 30 people sprang into action... Ten days later, 170 tons of marble processing equipment safely arrived at the Dexing Marble Factory. If transported by train, it would have taken at least two months.

Setting up a marble factory is not as easy as planting trees. They sought advice from foreign experts, invited management personnel, and formulated the "Safety Production Management System" and related management plans to ensure everything was done according to the rules. Young and middle-aged workers were also organized to hold technical training classes. They trained in the workshop during the day and studied professional technical knowledge at night. The bureau leaders took the lead in studying professional books on marble mining and processing.

In July 1988, the marble processing and mining equipment at the Dexing Marble Factory was finally installed and debugged successfully. "The earthy Forestry Bureau has become a first-class marble factory in the country," which became a topic of conversation in Dexing. One month later, the first batch of products was produced, and with its excellent quality, it quickly opened up the market.

Now, this marble factory, which produces 90,000 square meters of panels annually, generates an annual profit and tax revenue of 2.8 million yuan. In the factory's product display room, you can see a variety of colors such as ice flower green, camel gray, sea wave, and snow scene... Businessmen from Japan, Canada, and South Korea also flocked to place orders.

The establishment of the marble factory has brought wood and stone together in harmony. The forestry industry in Dexing has been infused with new vitality and energy.

    木石良缘

    “乌鸡山里头有宝！”上了年纪的江西德兴老乡们一代接一代地传说着。
    “乌鸡山有丰富的大理石矿藏。”来自地质勘探部门的专家提出了科学论证。
    可是，八辈子只晓得栽树、砍树的“林家佬”，过去作梦也没有想到开发自己林区内的地下宝贝。
    1987年底，德兴县林业局长余文森赴京参加林业部召开的会议。林业部长提出了六项改革措施，其中重要一项就是要求各级林业部门树立立体开发意识，发挥林区资源优势，发展多层次、多品种林业经济。
    余文森听入了迷，“搞大林业，搞立体开发，我们德兴县有得天独厚的条件啊！”
    从北京开会回来，余文森就召开局务会议，分析了开发矿产资源的有利条件，决定上大理石厂，设计方案很快被批准下来。办厂遇到的第一个难题就是资金。当时三材涨价，外汇升值，国内配套设备涨价……除了部、省投资外，尚有431万元需自己筹措。
    林业局办公室内烟雾缭绕，局领导们终于下了决心。第一，全局紧缩开支，确保大理石厂这个重点项目建设；第二，清理内外部借支，组织人员收回外单位欠款；第三，向省属厂矿单位和银行借款，搞负债经营。要办工业，开创新局面，就不能不冒风险。
    林业局职工四面出动，钱终于到手了。从意大利引进的两条生产线也运抵上海。为了节省开支，他们自己到上海拉设备。没有装卸工，就自己上车绑扎。500余箱磨料是纸盒包装的，起重设备无法吊装，余文森衣袖一捋，亲自装起车来。像一道无声的命令，30余人一齐动手……10天后，170吨大理石加工设备安全运抵德兴大理石厂。如果用火车运输，少说也要两个月。
    办大理石厂可不像栽树那么容易。他们向外国专家请教，请来管理人员，制定了《安全生产管理制度》和有关管理方案，做到有章可循。中青年职工也都组织起来，举办技术培训班。白天在车间培训操作，晚上上课，学习专业技术知识。局领导带头啃起了大理石开采和加工的专业书籍。
    1988年7月，德兴大理石厂加工设备和开采设备终于安装调试成功。“土里土气的林业局办成了全国第一流的大理石厂”，在德兴传为新闻。一个月后，首批产品出厂，以其优异的质量很快打开了市场。
    如今，这个年产9万平方米板材的大理石厂，年利税达280万元。在工厂的产品陈列室里，可以看到色彩纷呈的冰花青、驼灰、海浪、雪景……日本、加拿大、南朝鲜的客商也纷纷前来订货。
    大理石厂的建成，使木石结成了良缘。德兴林业因此输入了新的血液，增添了新的活力。
