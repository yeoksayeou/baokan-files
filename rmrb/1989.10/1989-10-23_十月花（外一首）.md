The flowers of October are so vivid in color,
Red is deep red, purple is a rich purple.
The leaves of the October flowers are so dark green,
One beam of sunlight after another is absorbed and digested,
Without any omission, without any deviation.
In October, people cherish the flowers,
Arranging their own flower beds,
Saying that winter is coming but it hasn't arrived yet,
The sun appears so charming,
As if pouring out all its passion, as if
So many flowers bloom from the heart.
Around her,
There is a wreath of spring blossoms.
The flowers of October, one by one,
Bloom all their colors for us,
All the colors are the final colors,
The pinnacle of autumn's beauty,
Rivaling the fruits in our hands.

Autumn Fruit Tree
That branch of autumn fruit peeks out from my window,
Not yet very red, not yet very large,
The glass gives it a transparent layer,
Fixing it in transparency.
The wind has begun to blow, as the wind passes,
That branch of autumn fruit on my window's glass,
Sways slightly.
It only sways slightly in that transparency,
Then remains fixed, making me feel in my concentration
That it is already enough, already substantial.
It stops like this outside my window, waiting
For the first frost of autumn,
It stretches out so patiently,
To show me in the morning
That it is fuller, sweeter than yesterday.

　　十月花（外一首）
　　（土族）建青
　　十月花颜色就这么浓重
　　红是深红，紫是绛紫
　　十月花叶子就这么墨绿墨绿的
　　一股接一股阳光被吸收被消化了
　　没有遗漏，没有偏移
　　在十月，人们怀着惜花的心情
　　设置好自己的花坛
　　说是冬天快了但还没有来呢
　　太阳显得如此动人
　　好像倾注了全部的热情，好像
　　这么多花朵由衷开放
　　她的周边
　　有了一只迎春的花环
　　十月的花，一朵又一朵
　　绽开它所有的颜色给我们
　　所有的颜色是最终的颜色
　　是秋天美景的极致
　　和我们手中的果实相媲美
　　秋子树
　　那一枝秋子在我家窗户探出头
    还不怎么红、不怎么大
　　玻璃给它一层透明
　　让它在透明中定格
　　风已开始吹，风吹过时
　　那一枝秋子在我家窗户的玻璃上
    略微晃动
　　它在那片透明里只略微晃动一下
　　然后保持定格，教我在凝神中
    感到它已足够多、足够重
　　它这样停在我家窗外是要等候
    秋天第一次冷峭的霜露
　　它这样耐心伸开来
　　是要在一个早晨教我看见
　　它比昨天更饱满、更香甜
