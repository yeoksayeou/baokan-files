	North Korean Ambassador Holds Press Conference

	People's Daily, Beijing, October 6 — Reporter Zhou Bixiong reports: North Korean Ambassador Chu Changjun held a press conference today regarding the proposal by the authorities, political parties, and mass organizations of the northern half of the Republic to the authorities, political parties, and mass organizations of South Korea to convene a national unification consultation meeting.

	Ambassador Chu Changjun said that we have long proposed a realistic and reasonable unification plan to establish a federal state. He pointed out that the South Korean authorities' attempt to monopolize the dialogue and exclude various political parties, factions, and strata from participating in the national unification consultation only shows that they do not genuinely care about national unification.

    朝鲜驻华大使举行记者招待会
    本报北京10月6日讯　记者周必忠报道：朝鲜驻华大使朱昌骏今天就共和国北半部当局、政党、群众团体致信南朝鲜当局、各政党、群众团体建议召开民族统一协商会议一事，在此间举行记者招待会。
    朱昌骏大使说，我们早就提出通过建立联邦国家的方法实现国家统一的既现实又合理的统一方案。他指出，南朝鲜当局企图垄断对话，企图排除各政党、派别、各阶层参加民族统一协商，只能说明他们实际上对国家的统一不关心。
