The big basket has vegetables, the small basket is full
(September 28, Wen Hui Bao, Wen Hui Illustration)

The big basket has vegetables, the small basket is full. This is a vivid description of the current situation in China's agricultural production. The big basket represents the country's overall agricultural output, which has seen significant increases in recent years. The small basket, on the other hand, represents the individual households' production, which has also seen substantial improvements.

The government has been implementing various policies to support agricultural development. These policies have encouraged farmers to increase their production and improve the quality of their crops. As a result, the big basket has been filling up with more and more vegetables, indicating a steady growth in agricultural output.

At the same time, individual households have also benefited from these policies. The small basket, which represents the individual households' production, has been filling up as well. This indicates that the policies have been effective in improving the living standards of rural households.

The illustration by Wen Hui captures the essence of this situation. It shows a big basket overflowing with vegetables, symbolizing the country's agricultural prosperity. Next to it is a small basket, also full, representing the individual households' achievements.

In conclusion, the big basket having vegetables and the small basket being full is a testament to the success of China's agricultural policies. These policies have not only increased the country's agricultural output but have also improved the living standards of rural households. This is a significant achievement that reflects the government's commitment to agricultural development and rural prosperity.
