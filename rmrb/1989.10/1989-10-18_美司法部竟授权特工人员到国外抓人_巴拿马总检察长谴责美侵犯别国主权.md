The U.S. Justice Department has authorized FBI agents to arrest individuals wanted by the United States in foreign countries and bring them back to the U.S. without the permission of the foreign government, according to a report by the Los Angeles Times on October 13.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the Justice Department made this secret decision in June, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy on arresting and extraditing criminals abroad since 1980.

President Bush expressed support for this decision during a press conference on October 13, but he emphasized that the FBI must carefully consider each case before taking action.

Observers noted that this decision by the Justice Department could pave the way for the U.S. to take similar actions against Manuel Noriega, the de facto ruler of Panama. The U.S. has accused Noriega of involvement in drug trafficking and has threatened to abduct him to stand trial in the U.S.

Panama's Attorney General, Gustavo Villalaz, warned that the U.S. decision is a violation of the sovereignty of other countries.

    美司法部竟授权特工人员到国外抓人
    巴拿马总检察长谴责美侵犯别国主权
    新华社华盛顿电  据《洛杉矶时报》十三日报道，美国司法部最近授权联邦调查局的特工人员到外国抓捕被美国通缉的人并押解回国，而不必经过外国政府许可。
    《洛杉矶时报》说，司法部的这项秘密决定是今年六月作出的，它标志着一九八○年以来美国在海外逮捕引渡犯人的政策发生了重大变化。
    美国总统布什十三日在记者招待会上对这一决定表示支持，但他说，美国联邦调查局在采取行动之前，必须先对案件进行审慎的考虑。
    观察家们说，美国司法部的这一决定引发了美国对巴拿马实权人物诺列加采取这种行动的可能。美国曾指责诺列加参与毒品走私活动，并扬言要绑架他到美国受审。
    巴拿马国家总检察长奥左斯托·比利亚拉斯警告说，美国的这项决定是对别国主权的侵犯。
