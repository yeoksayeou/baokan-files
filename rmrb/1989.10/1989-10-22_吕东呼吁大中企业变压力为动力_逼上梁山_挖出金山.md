Lü Dong urges large and medium-sized enterprises to turn pressure into motivation
Forced onto the mountain, gold can be mined. Large and medium-sized enterprises must have the courage to turn pressure into motivation and difficulties into opportunities. They should use the opportunity of rectification and reorganization to comprehensively improve the quality of enterprises and elevate the level of enterprise management to a new stage.

The president of the China Industrial Economic Association, Lü Dong, believes that the above-mentioned concept should become a consensus among large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. These remarks were made by him on the 19th at the summary of a symposium held in the East China region for some large enterprises (groups). At the meeting, various parties reflected that currently, large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are facing many difficulties in production and operation. Lü Dong said in his summary speech that to improve and activate large and medium-sized enterprises, we must address both macro-control measures taken by the state and improvements in the internal work of enterprises. However, to overcome the current difficulties, the focus should be on the internal work of enterprises.

Lü Dong pointed out that in macro-management, we must truly implement a policy of giving priority to large and medium-sized enterprises. For example, providing necessary material guarantees for enterprises to implement mandatory plans, gradually easing the tight financial situation of enterprises, and granting large enterprises and enterprise groups the right to export, etc. Lü Dong also pointed out that at present, we must especially emphasize that enterprises should look inward, deepen potential, take improving economic benefits as the center, and combine strengthening management with deepening reform.

　　吕东呼吁大中企业变压力为动力
　　逼上梁山　挖出金山
    据新华社上海10月21日电　（记者陈继明）逼上梁山，才能挖出金山。大中型企业一定要有变压力为动力、变困难为机遇的胆略，以治理整顿为契机，全面提高企业素质，使企业管理水平跨上新台阶。
    中国工业经济协会会长吕东认为，上述观念应该成为大中型国营企业的共识。这番话是他19日在华东地区部分大企业（集团）座谈会上作总结时讲的。会上各方反映，当前大中型国营企业生产经营步履维艰，困难很多。吕东在总结讲话中说，搞好搞活大中型企业，必须双管齐下，把国家采取的宏观措施与改善企业内部工作结合起来。但要克服当前困难，立脚点应该放在企业内部。
    吕东指出，在宏观管理上，要真正对大中型企业实行倾斜政策。例如为企业执行指令性计划提供必要的物质保证，逐步缓解企业资金紧张局面，赋予大企业和企业集团外贸出口权等。吕东同时指出，目前要特别强调企业眼睛向内，深入挖潜，以提高经济效益为中心，把加强管理与深化改革结合起来。
