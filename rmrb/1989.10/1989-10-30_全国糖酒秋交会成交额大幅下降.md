Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 29th

The 1989 National Sugar and Liquor Autumn Trade Fair, which lasted for five days, concluded on October 27th in Chengdu. The total transaction volume for this fair reached 2.116 billion yuan, a decrease of 61.14% compared to the previous year's autumn fair.

Merchants from various regions generally felt that business was tougher this year. Unlike the previous year's situation of having money but no goods, this year saw merchants with less money and manufacturers with more goods. Additionally, the main attraction of previous fairs—white liquor—has become the most neglected commodity in this year's fair. Since mid-September, when the prices of 13 national-level famous liquors were reduced, market sales have seen some improvement, but the overall sales situation has not fundamentally improved. Some mid-to-low-tier second-brand white liquors are more popular.

　　全国糖酒秋交会成交额大幅下降
    据新华社成都十月二十九日电  （记者南建）历时五天的一九八九年全国糖酒三类商品秋季交易会二十七日在成都降下帷幕。此次糖酒秋交会总成交额达二十一点一六亿元，比去年秋交会下降百分之六十一点一四。
    来自各地的客商普遍感到现在生意比较难做，与去年有钱无货的情况相反，今年是商家钱少厂家货多。另外，往届秋交会上的主角——白酒，已在本届秋交会上成为最受冷落的商品。十三种国家级名酒自九月中旬调低价格后，市场销售有所回升，但销售仍未根本好转。一些中低档的二名牌白酒受欢迎。
