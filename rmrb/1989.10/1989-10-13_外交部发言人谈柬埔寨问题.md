People's Daily, Beijing, October 12th

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Zhaoxing, clarified China's government stance on the Cambodian issue at the press conference this afternoon.

A reporter asked: Some people believe that the Cambodian issue can only be resolved through military confrontation. What is your comment on this?

Li Zhaoxing said, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the international community both advocate for a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political resolution to the Cambodian issue. We hope that Vietnam will take a realistic attitude and achieve a comprehensive political resolution to the Cambodian issue. The key to a political resolution is that Vietnam must genuinely withdraw its troops from Cambodia under strict and effective international supervision by the United Nations, and establish a temporary coalition government in Cambodia led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Only in this way can Cambodia become a truly independent, peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned country.

A reporter from the Vietnam News Agency asked, the Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila suggested that ASEAN countries hold a third informal meeting to discuss the political resolution of the Cambodian issue. What is China's stance on this?

Li Zhaoxing replied, this is a matter to be discussed by the relevant parties. Our stance is: we support any efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political resolution to the Cambodian issue. The Cambodian issue was caused by Vietnam's aggression, so a political resolution to the Cambodian issue requires Vietnam to stop its aggression and also to eliminate the consequences of its aggression against Cambodia.

    外交部发言人谈柬埔寨问题
    本报北京10月12日讯　外交部发言人李肇星在今天下午的新闻发布会上阐明了中国政府关于柬埔寨问题的立场。
    有记者问：有人认为，柬埔寨问题现在只能通过战场上的较量才能解决。你对此有何评论？
    李肇星说，民柬联合政府和国际社会都主张全面、公正、合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题。我们希望越南采取现实态度，实现柬埔寨问题的全面政治解决。政治解决的关键是，越南必须在联合国主持的严格有效的国际监督下真正从柬全部撤军，在柬成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。只有这样，才能保证柬埔寨成为一个真正独立、和平、中立和不结盟的国家。
    越南通讯社记者问，泰国外长西提建议东盟国家召开关于政治解决柬埔寨问题的第三次非正式会议，中国对此持何态度？
    李肇星答道，这是应由有关各方商量的问题。我们的态度是：凡是为谋求全面、公正、合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题的努力，我们都支持。柬埔寨问题是由越南侵略造成的，因此，政治解决柬埔寨问题就要求越南停止侵略，同时也要消除侵略柬埔寨所造成的后果。
