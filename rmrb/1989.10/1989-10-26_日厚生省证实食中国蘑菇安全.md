Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare has confirmed that Chinese mushrooms, which have been banned from import by the United States, have never caused any food poisoning incidents in Japan.

According to reports from Kyodo News Agency today, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare has stated that there have been no cases of food poisoning from consuming Chinese mushrooms in Japan.

It is understood that the U.S. authorities recently decided to ban the import of Chinese mushrooms on the grounds that there have been incidents of food poisoning from consuming Chinese mushrooms in the United States.

According to statistics from the Japanese side, in the past two years, Chinese mushrooms have accounted for 70% to 80% of the total imported mushrooms in Japan, with the annual import volume being around 14,000 tons.
