On October 16th in the afternoon, the Stone City government held a meeting with a thousand attendees at the Stone City First Paper Mill, which is operated by Ma Shengli. The meeting focused on the recent fire at the mill, during which Ma Shengli was severely criticized. Ma Shengli also made a self-criticism at the meeting.

On October 14th at 10:13 PM, the Stone City Public Security Fire Brigade received a report of a fire at the Stone City First Paper Mill. They immediately dispatched 14 fire trucks to the scene. After more than two hours of intense firefighting, they managed to save imported equipment worth over 200,000 yuan. However, the entire inventory in the sanitary napkin workshop warehouse was reduced to ashes, resulting in a direct economic loss of 23,800 yuan. The investigation revealed that the fire was caused by the mill's failure to implement fire safety regulations.

To educate Ma Shengli and serve as a warning to other units, the city government decided to hold this unique on-site meeting. At the meeting, city government leaders severely criticized Ma Shengli for prioritizing production over fire safety, urging attendees to learn from this incident. Ma Shengli also deeply reflected on his mistakes, expressing his determination to raise awareness, lead the entire mill's staff to rectify fire safety issues, and further examine their thoughts, management, and work style. He vowed to make up for the economic losses caused by the fire.

Many factory directors present at the meeting commented: "This fire has awakened Ma Shengli, and it has also awakened us."

    石家庄市府召开现场会
    马胜利因纸厂失火受批评
    本报石家庄10月17日电　10月16日下午，河北省石家庄市政府在马胜利承包的市第一造纸厂召开千人现场会，就该厂失火一事对马胜利给予严厉批评，马胜利也在会上作了检查。
    10月14日22时13分，石家庄市公安消防大队接到市第一造纸厂着火的警报，立即出动14部消防车赶赴现场。经过两个多小时的奋力扑救，保住了价值20多万元的进口设备，但卫生巾车间仓库存放的全部物品化为灰烬，直接经济损失2.38万元。经查，这次大火是该厂防火制度不落实等原因所致。
    为教育马胜利本人，提醒其它单位引以为戒，市政府决定召开这次别开生面的现场会。会上，市政府领导严厉批评了马胜利只顾生产、忽视消防安全的错误，要求与会者记取教训。马胜利也深刻检查了自己的错误，表示要提高认识，带领全厂职工补上消防安全这一课，进一步查思想、查管理、查作风，把失火给工厂造成的经济损失夺回来。
    与会的不少厂长说：这把火烧醒了马胜利，也烧醒了我们。
