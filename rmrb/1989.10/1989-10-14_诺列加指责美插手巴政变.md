Panamanian Defense Forces Commander Manuel Noriega today accused the United States of bribing some Panamanian military officers who staged a coup last week, claiming that the U.S. paid them more than $1 million.

He also accused Nicaraguan counter-revolutionary guerrillas of acting as intermediaries in passing information between U.S. officials and coup plotters.

Noriega made these allegations during an interview with reporters from the Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe, which published the interview today.

Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department strongly denied Noriega's accusations, but a White House spokesman said they would look into the matter.

    诺列加指责美插手巴政变
    新华社华盛顿10月12日电  巴拿马国防军司令诺列加今天指责美国收买了上周发动政变的一些巴拿马军官，称美国曾付给他们100多万美元。
    他还指责尼加拉瓜反政府游击队在美国官员和政变策划者之间传递情报。
    诺列加是在接受《洛杉矶时报》和《波斯顿环球报》记者的采访时提出上述指控的，这两家报纸今天刊登了这次采访的报道。
    美国国防部和国务院发言人坚决否认诺列加的指控，但白宫发言人则表示要查一查。
