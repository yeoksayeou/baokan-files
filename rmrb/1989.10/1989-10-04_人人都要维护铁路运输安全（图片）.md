	Bottom Image: On the Yingxu Line, groups of farmers going to the market and small vendors often ride on freight trains, and there are even children among them.

	Left Image: At the Yongjun Road intersection in Datong City, neither the red light nor the barrier can stop the "brave" rushers.

	Bottom Image: Many people climb onto the roof of the transport train from Yueyang to Chenglingji to cool off.

	Left Image: Students from a certain school in Yichang often gather on the tracks in front of the school gate to play, and someone should stop them.
