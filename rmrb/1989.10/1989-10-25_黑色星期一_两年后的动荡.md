At around 3 p.m. on October 13, the New York stock market suddenly plunged. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190.58 points. On October 16, Monday, stock markets in Tokyo, London, and other cities saw significant declines after opening. The grim scene of "Black Monday" two years ago is still fresh in people's minds. The 60th anniversary of the global financial panic of October 1929 is approaching. October seems to be the "gateway to hell" for Western financial markets.

Unlike the causes of "Black Monday," which included overheating of the U.S. economy and inflation crises, the trigger for this stock market crash was the failure of a corporate merger. The U.S. Airline Company has been struggling, and there have been frequent rumors that it might sell its shares. Recently, the pilots' union of United Airlines, some employees of U.S. Airline Company, and British Airways planned to buy U.S. Airline Company's shares. However, they failed to raise the approximately $70 billion needed. After the news broke, the stock price of U.S. Airline Company plummeted, leading to the stock market crash in October this year.

This time, the extent of the decline and the subsequent reaction differed from "Black Monday." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 190.58 points, the second-largest drop after "Black Monday." The Nikkei Stock Average in Tokyo once fell by 647.33 yen, the largest drop this year. The Financial Times Stock Exchange Index in London fell by 70.5 points, about one-third of the drop on "Black Monday." Overall, the decline this time was smaller than on "Black Monday." The stock market did not see a rush to sell and continuous declines, thanks to the emergency coordination measures taken by the financial authorities of Western countries. On October 16, the U.S. Federal Reserve injected $2 billion into the banking system, and on October 17, it injected another $1.5 billion. On October 16, major financial companies in Japan received a notice from the financial authorities to restrain selling. As a result, the selling trend in the Tokyo stock market on Monday was relatively curbed.

Experts analyzed that during "Black Monday," Japan was a victim. This time, Japan was the main "spark." Because the main target for raising funds for the merger was Japan's major banks with substantial capital, and most Japanese banks took a passive stance, failing to meet the merger's hope that Japan would bear 30% of the required funds. However, from the restrained reaction of the Japanese stock market to the New York stock market crash, Japan was also a major collaborator in calming the crash.

After the crash, stock prices in major financial markets began to rebound. Optimists believe that this crash was just a false alarm, and its background is different from that of "Black Monday." Cautious people believe that a calm analysis of the causes of the crash can avoid repeating past mistakes. First, 60 years ago during the global financial crisis, the United States was the world's largest creditor nation, but now it has become the world's largest debtor nation. The United States not only cannot control the international market but also lacks the strength to improve its own economy.

Second, it is generally believed that stock prices are a barometer of economic conditions. However, the reality is that stock price distortions do not truly reflect the economic development situation. For example, this year, the U.S. economic growth rate was about 2%, while stock prices increased by 30%, breaking the historical high in early September. In fact, the main driving force behind the stock price increase is the corporate merger boom, with the stock prices of merged companies pushing the stock market up. This stock market boom, which lacks sufficient surplus funds and deviates from the economic situation of enterprises, will inevitably lead to a stock market crash at the slightest disturbance. This stock market crash is a warning against the corporate merger boom and excessive stock price increases.

The stock market crash further exposed the fragility of the U.S. economy. It is well known that the U.S. fiscal deficit has long relied on foreign capital to fill the gap. U.S. corporate mergers also rely on foreign bank funds, otherwise, they may fail. This stock market crash once again proved the risk of living on borrowed money. Compared to two years ago, the U.S. economy shows signs of a soft landing, but concerns about the "twin deficits" in finance and trade still exist. Unstable factors are lurking, and no one can guarantee that the stock market will not crash again.

　　“黑色星期一”两年后的动荡
　　本报记者　于青
    10月13日下午近3点开始，纽约股市突然发生滑坡，道·琼斯30种工业股票平均指数直线下降190.58点。16日星期一，东京、伦敦等股市开盘后，股价一度大跌。两年前10月19日“黑色星期一”的惨景，人们还记忆犹新。1929年10月世界金融市场大恐慌的60周年即将来临。10月，好像就是西方金融市场的“鬼门关”。
    与“黑色星期一”起因于美国景气过热、通货膨胀危机等综合因素不同，这次纽约股市暴跌的导火线是企业兼并失败引起的。美国航空公司经营不善，近年多次传出该公司将出卖股份之说。最近，美国的联合航空公司驾驶员工会、美国航空公司部分职员和英国航空公司准备联合买下美国航空公司的股份。在筹集收买股份的资金时，未能凑齐所需的约70亿美元。消息传出后，美国航空公司股价急跌，遂酿成今年10月的股市暴跌风。
    这次股市的跌幅和暴跌后的反应，与“黑色星期一”也有不同。纽约道·琼斯工业股票平均指数下跌190.58点。仅次于“黑色星期一”的508点。东京的东证股票平均价格一度下跌647.33日元，是今年以来东京股市的最大跌幅。伦敦的金融时报证券交易指数下跌70.5点，相当于“黑色星期一”跌幅的约1／3。总的看来，这次跌幅普遍小于“黑色星期一”。股市没有出现竞相抛售和连续下跌的现象，得救于西方国家财政当局的紧急协调措施。美国联邦储备委员会16日向银行系统投放了200亿美元，17日又投放了15亿美元。16日日本金融界各大公司接到财政当局通知，要求对抛售采取克制态度。结果星期一东京股市抛售势头受到相对抑制。
    行家分析，“黑色星期一”时，日本是受害者。这次暴跌日本是主要
  “点火者”。因为美国航空公司的兼并者们筹资的主要对象是资金雄厚的日本大银行，而日本多数银行采取消极观望态度，没有满足兼并者希望日本方面承担所需资金30％的要求。但从日本股市对纽约股市暴跌的克制反应看，日本也是这次暴跌平息的主要合作者。
    暴跌过后，主要金融市场股价开始反弹。乐观派认为，这次暴跌不过是一场虚惊，其背景与“黑色星期一”时毕竟不同。慎重派认为，冷静分析暴跌成因才能避免重蹈覆辙。首先，60年前世界金融危机时，美国是世界最大债权国，现在已沦为世界最大债务国。美国不仅无法左右国际市场，对自身经济改观也是力不从心。
    其二，通常认为，股票行市是经济状况的晴雨表。而现实是，股价的扭曲现象并不真实反映经济发展现状。例如，今年以来，美国经济增长速度约为2％，而股票价格增长了30％，9月初突破历史最高纪录。其实，股价上涨的主流是受企业兼并热的影响，被兼并企业的股价上涨对股市上扬推波助澜。这种没有充足剩余资金为后盾、与企业经济状况相背离的虚假性股市繁荣，一有风吹草动，必将导致股市暴跌。这次股市暴跌，是对企业兼并热和股价上涨过头的一个警告。
    股市暴跌进一步暴露了美国经济的脆弱性。美国财政赤字长期依赖外资填补已是人所共知。美国企业兼并也得靠外国银行资金支持，否则就可能流产。这次股市暴跌再次证明了借钱度日的风险性。与两年前相比，美国经济出现了软着陆的迹象，但财政贸易“双赤字”的忧虑依然存在，不安定因素时隐时现，谁也不敢保证，股市暴跌不会再次发生。
