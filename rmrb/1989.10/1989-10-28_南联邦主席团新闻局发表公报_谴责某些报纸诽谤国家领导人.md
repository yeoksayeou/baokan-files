The Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia issued a statement today condemning certain newspapers for spreading false information aimed at slandering the national leaders of Yugoslavia.

The statement said that in recent times, certain newspapers have frequently made rude attacks and defamatory remarks about the President, Vice-Presidents, and other members of the Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They have spread absurd and unfounded information about the work of the Presidency meetings, the speeches of certain members, and even their private lives. They have fabricated disputes and conflicts among them.

The Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia opposes and condemns these actions by the newspapers and clearly points out that their malicious attacks or reprinting of such attacks are aimed at damaging the collective leadership of the state, the integrity and prestige of the highest state institution, and disrupting public opinion. They seek to undermine the efforts of Yugoslav society to solve problems and difficulties, as well as the prestige of Yugoslavia as a country, especially as the chair of the Non-Aligned Movement in the world. Such behavior should be punished by the laws of all law-abiding societies.

The statement also said that the editorial departments of the newspapers that published these attacks have not only violated the most basic moral, ethical, and professional standards of journalism and effective national laws, but they have also shown complete disrespect for their own country—the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Presidency finally calls on journalists, editors, and all publishing department staff, social organizations, and relevant state authorities who adhere to the rules of journalism to take action to combat this phenomenon.

　　南联邦主席团新闻局发表公报
　　谴责某些报纸诽谤国家领导人
    本报贝尔格莱德10月26日电　记者严正报道：今天南通社发表了南联邦主席团报刊新闻局公报，谴责某些报纸散布旨在诽谤南斯拉夫国家领导人的消息。
    公报说，最近以来某些报纸经常粗鲁攻击和损害南联邦主席团主席、副主席和其他成员，就南主席团会议的工作情况、某些成员的发言，甚至他们的私生活散布一些荒诞不经的消息，并臆造他们之间的争论和冲突。
    南联邦主席团反对和谴责这些报纸的做法和行为，并明确指出，它们对南联邦主席团的恶意攻击或转载这种攻击，旨在损害南斯拉夫集体国家元首、最高国家机构的完整性和威信，企图扰乱公众舆论，破坏南斯拉夫社会为解决问题和困难所作的努力以及南斯拉夫国家特别是作为不结盟运动执行主席在世界上的威望。这种行为应受到所有法制社会的法律制裁。
    公报还说，刊登上述攻击的报纸的编辑部，不但违反了新闻工作最基本的道德、规范和准则以及有效的国家法律，而且也完全不尊重自己的国家——南斯拉夫社会主义联邦共和国。南主席团最后要求遵守新闻工作规则的记者、编辑以及所有的出版部门干部、社会组织和有关的国家主管机构行动起来以击退这种现象。
