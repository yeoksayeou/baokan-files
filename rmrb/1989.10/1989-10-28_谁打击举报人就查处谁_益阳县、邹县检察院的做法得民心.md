Whoever Strikes Whistleblowers Will Be Dealt With
The Practices of Yiyang County and Zhou County Procuratorates Gain Public Support

Hu Zaihua from Yiyang County, Hunan, wrote: Some of our county's residents actively reported to the judicial authorities the crimes of embezzlement, theft, bribery, and speculation by leaders in their units. Before the procuratorate dealt with the criminals, some whistleblowers were subjected to varying degrees of retaliation. For this reason, our county procuratorate has seriously handled such retaliation cases.

On October 8 last year, Guo Juxiang, a typist at the county machinery factory, reported that Deputy Director Yang Songhui had forged fake invoices and embezzled 1,800 yuan of public funds. As a result, Yang Songhui retaliated against her on the grounds of "false accusation." On November 22 last year, Yang Songhui beat Guo Juxiang, causing injuries. On July 16 this year, Yang Songhui's wife hit Guo Juxiang with a hot water bottle, scalding her. After learning of this situation, the county procuratorate immediately joined forces with the county disciplinary committee and the county economic commission to form a joint investigation team. After more than a month of investigation, it was confirmed that the situation reported by Guo Juxiang was true. Before dealing with Yang Songhui's problem on September 11, the county procuratorate commended Guo Juxiang's righteous deed at a public meeting.

Chen Ximei, an accountant at the county tire factory, reported the factory director's embezzlement to the procuratorate. The director then withheld Chen Ximei's wages for two months and bonuses for four months from January to April this year, and transferred her out of the financial department. The county procuratorate corrected the director's wrongdoing.

In response to some units' erroneous practice of regulating public reports as "only internal, not external, only downward, not upward, and limited to maintaining the interests of business partners," the county procuratorate conducted legal consultations. As a result, 5 criminals with more than 100,000 yuan were turned in during September.

Ding Wenbiao from the People's Procuratorate of Jining City, Shandong, wrote: From April 19 to May 23, the disciplinary committee and procuratorate of Zhou County, Shandong, jointly investigated and confirmed based on public reports that Tang Jiding of Qianbao Village, Pingshang Temple Town, Zhou County, embezzled 1,314 yuan of public funds by abusing his power. After the relevant departments recovered all the illicit funds, Tang Jiding bore a grudge against the informant, fellow villager Tang Kebin, and on May 27, first cursed him, then punched him in the left eye, and then the two fought. According to the hospital's diagnosis, Tang Kebin had abrasions on the left shoulder and both elbows; slight bruising under the left eye, left face bitten; soft tissue injury. Tang Jiding's malicious retaliation against the informant had a very bad influence among the people. The People's Procuratorate of Zhou County arrested Tang Jiding for the crime of retaliatory framing.

　　谁打击举报人就查处谁
　　益阳县、邹县检察院的做法得民心
    湖南益阳县　胡再华来信：我县的一些群众积极向司法部门检举本单位领导的贪污盗窃、行贿受贿、投机倒把等犯罪事实。在检察部门对犯罪分子作出处理之前，有些检举人遭到了不同程度的打击报复。为此，我县检察院严肃处理这类打击报复事件。
    去年10月8日，县机械厂打字员郭菊香，举报副厂长杨松辉伪造假发票，将1800元公款私分等犯罪事实，结果杨松辉以“诬告”为由，对她打击报复。去年11月22日，杨松辉将郭菊香殴打致伤。今年7月16日，杨松辉的妻子又用热水瓶砸郭菊香，将郭菊香烫伤。县检察院知道这一情况后，立即会同县纪委和县经委组成联合调查组，经一个多月调查，证实了郭菊香所反映的情况。在对杨松辉问题未处理前的9月11日，县检察院在群众大会上表彰了郭菊香的正义之举。
    县轮胎厂会计陈细枚，因向检察院举报了厂长的贪污行为，厂长便从今年元月至4月，扣发陈细枚两个月的工资，4个月的奖金，并将其调离财会室。县检察院纠正了厂长的错误行为。
    针对有的单位规定群众举报“只对内不对外，只对下不对上，要以维护经营关系户利益为限界”的错误做法，县检察院开展法律咨询，结果9月份里，万元以上的犯罪分子有5人自首。
    山东济宁市人民检察院　丁文标来信：4月19日至5月23日，山东邹县纪委、检察院根据群众举报，联合调查证实：邹县平阳寺镇前鲍村汤计丁利用职权贪污公款1314元。这笔赃款被有关部门全部追回后，汤计丁对检举人、本村村民汤克彬怀恨在心，于5月27日先是破口大骂，后又照汤克彬左眼处猛击一拳，接着两人撕打在一起。经医院诊断，汤克彬左肩部、左右肘部表皮擦伤；左眼下轻度淤血，左面部被咬伤；软组织损伤。汤计丁打击报复举报人的恶劣行为在群众中造成了极坏的影响。邹县人民检察院将汤计丁以报复陷害罪依法逮捕。
