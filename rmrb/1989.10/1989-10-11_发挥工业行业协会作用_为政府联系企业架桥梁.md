In the process of rectification and deepening reforms, industrial associations should fully leverage their roles. This was the point emphasized by Lü Dōng, President of the China Industrial Economic Association, at the conclusion of a symposium on industrial associations held today.

Industrial associations in China are a product of economic system reforms and have seen significant development in recent years. The number of national-level industrial associations has increased from over 70 last year to more than 90 this year, becoming an important bridge between the government and enterprises.

Lü Dōng hopes that during the period of economic rectification, all industrial associations will earnestly follow the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and better serve both enterprises and the government:

	• Strengthen research on industry development strategies to propose policy suggestions for adjusting the industrial structure.
	• Focus on improving and revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises, and conduct various forms of service activities to provide technical, economic, and management consultations for these enterprises. At the same time, special attention should be paid to serving small and medium-sized enterprises to promote the coordinated development of large, medium, and small enterprises.
	• Center on improving economic efficiency to carry out economic analysis activities across the entire industry.
	• Seriously undertake quality comparison work to strive for improving the overall quality level of the industry.
	• Promote technological progress within the industry.

    发挥工业行业协会作用  为政府联系企业架桥梁
    本报北京10月10日讯　记者刘燮阳报道：在治理整顿、深化改革中，工业行业协会应充分发挥作用。这是中国工业经济协会会长吕东在今天结束的工业行业协会座谈会上提出的。
    我国的工业行业协会是经济体制改革的产物，近年有了较大的发展。全国性的工业行业协会已由去年70多个，增加到今年的90多个，成为政府联系企业的重要桥梁。
    吕东希望在国民经济的治理整顿时期，各工业行业协会认真按照十三届四中全会精神，更好地为企业、为政府服务：
    ——加强行业发展战略研究，为调整产业结构提出政策建议。
    ——围绕搞好搞活大中型企业，开展多种形式的服务活动，更好地为大中型企业提供技术、经济、管理等方面的咨询。与此同时，要特别搞好为中小企业的服务，促进大中小企业协调发展。
    ——以提高经济效益为中心，开展全行业的经济分析活动。
    ——认真做好质量评比工作，努力提高全行业质量水平。
    ——推动本行业的技术进步。
