Ren Jianxin, the President of the Supreme People's Court, reported today that since 1982, courts at all levels across the country have strictly enforced the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on severely punishing criminals who seriously disrupt the economy. They have legally and severely punished a large number of criminals who seriously disrupt the economy. By the end of 1988, a total of 360,000 first-instance economic crime cases had been accepted, and 460,000 criminals had been sentenced, including 81,433 embezzlement criminals, 13,026 bribery criminals, 14,949 speculation criminals, and 2,454 smuggling criminals.

He said that from January to August this year, courts at all levels across the country accepted a total of 47,339 first-instance economic crime cases and sentenced 63,387 criminals, including 4,756 embezzlement criminals, 1,262 bribery criminals, 966 speculation criminals, and 241 smuggling criminals.

Ren Jianxin said that from August 15, when the Notice was issued, to October 15, courts at all levels across the country accepted a total of 6,755 economic crime cases of embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and smuggling, which were prosecuted by the procuratorial organs. Although most of these cases were investigated and filed before the Notice was issued, since the Notice stipulates that economic crime cases of embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and smuggling that are being handled after the issuance of the Notice are also subject to the provisions of the Notice, the courts have applied the Notice to sentence 5,167 economic crime cases. Among them, there were 1,831 cases of embezzlement, 830 cases of bribery, and 181 cases of speculation; a total of 7,913 criminals were sentenced, including 2,249 who were sentenced leniently and 989 who were sentenced severely. Of those sentenced leniently, 1,295 were given lighter sentences, 737 were given reduced sentences, and 217 were exempted from criminal penalties. Among the sentenced criminals, 4,406 have already taken legal effect. Among them, 351 were sentenced to death (including death with a two-year reprieve), life imprisonment, and more than ten years of imprisonment, 889 were sentenced to more than five years but less than ten years of imprisonment, and 3,166 were sentenced to less than five years of imprisonment; 8 were bureau-level cadres, and 91 were county-level cadres.

    新华社北京10月25日电　最高人民法院院长任建新今天说，1982年以后，全国各级人民法院坚决执行全国人大常委会《关于严惩严重破坏经济的罪犯的决定》，依法从严惩处了一大批严重破坏经济的犯罪分子，至1988年底，共受理一审经济犯罪案件36万件，判处罪犯46万名，其中贪污犯81433名，受贿犯13026名，投机倒把犯14949名，走私犯2454名。
