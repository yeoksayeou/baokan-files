The case of Zhang Bin, a deputy section chief at the Ministry of Agriculture, being arrested for bribery has given rise to much reflection. I am reminded of a question: How is it that a county-run winery, which is in debt by over 4 million yuan, facing financial difficulties to the point of being unable to afford shipping costs, and on the brink of bankruptcy, could spend nearly 80,000 yuan to organize a news conference and participate in wine evaluation activities?

It is quite clear that the reason Daozhen Winery was willing to spend so much on bribery was to secure a "Ministry-Level Excellent" award. One can imagine that if this bribery case had not been exposed, they would likely have enjoyed the benefits of this "Ministry-Level Excellent" title— the factory director would have gained significant fame, and perhaps even earned the titles of "reformer" or "entrepreneur," earning admiration from others. If things went this way, the factory on the brink of collapse might turn things around; even if it did collapse, it would be a later issue, unrelated to the "entrepreneur."

For some reason, in recent years, society seems to have contracted a "fame and excellence worship syndrome." Not only do consumers insist on buying only famous brands (which is understandable, but one must be careful not to be deceived), but the supervising departments also place considerable weight on "fame" when evaluating enterprises. As long as an enterprise is awarded some kind of "excellent" title and gains "fame," even if the enterprise is poorly managed and chaotic, it will be praised and supported by all sides, at the very least receiving some "understanding" and "consideration." On the other hand, those factory directors and managers who focus on solid foundational work and are not so keen on publicity are often neglected. I am not saying that enterprises should not focus on publicity and expand their influence; rather, I am saying that they should not just talk big and be all show with no substance; even worse, they should not use illegal means like bribery to obtain honors.

Under the influence of this trend that values fame over substance, some enterprise leaders have developed a bad habit of seeking fame. These people do not want to put in the effort to manage the basics but are particularly enthusiastic about external, superficial matters that can create a "sensational effect." Some even increase the number of times the factory director or manager appears in television advertisements as the internal production and operation situation worsens. Indeed, some enterprises are unwilling to spend money on technological upgrades or developing new products but are willing to use various means (some of which are not legitimate) to invest in increasing their fame, even if it means operating at a loss, just to buy the title of a "famous and excellent" enterprise.

If this trend of valuing fame over substance is not corrected, then making an analogy that is not entirely appropriate: the reform in that place is like a pot that is always boiling. It looks very lively, but in reality, there is nothing but water inside.

    知名度，多少伪劣假汝而行
    汪义群
    农业部副处长张滨因受贿罪被捕一案，使人产生颇多思索。我想到这么一个问题：一个亏损400多万元、资金困难到连发货的运费都难以筹措、濒临倒闭的县办酒厂，何以居然花费近8万元，去组织什么新闻发布会，参加什么评酒活动呢？
    十分明显，道真酒厂之所以不惜血本行贿，就是为了捞个“部优”。可以想见，如果这起受贿案不被揭露，那么，他们很可能会享受到这个“部优”带来的诸多好处——厂长将因此而名声大振，说不定还会捞一顶“改革者”、“企业家”的桂冠，让人刮目相看。若欲如此，那濒临倒闭的企业或许能转危为安；即使倒闭，那也是后话，同“企业家”无甚关系了。
    不知咋的，这些年来，社会似乎染上了“名优崇拜症”，不仅消费者非名优不买（这本未可厚非，只是要谨防上当），主管部门在对企业考评中，“知名度”也是一个有相当分量的砝码。只要评上个什么“优”，有了“知名度”，即使企业经营再不善、管理再混乱，也会“一俊遮百丑”，受到各方面的赞誉、扶持，起码也可以得到若干“谅解”和“关照”。相反，那些扎扎实实抓基础建设，不怎么注重张扬的厂长、经理，却受到冷落。我这里并不是说，企业不应该抓宣传，不应该扩大影响；而是说，不能光卖嘴皮子，华而不实；更不能靠行贿等非法手段，骗取荣誉。
    在那种重名不重实的风气鼓励下，确有一些企业负责人养成了一种爱造声势的坏毛病。这些人对基础管理不愿下功夫去抓，而对那些外在的、表面的、能收到“轰动效应”的事特别热衷。更有甚者，内部的生产经营形势越是不妙，就越要增加厂长、经理在电视广告中亮相的次数。确有一些企业，舍不得在技术改造、开发新产品上花钱，却舍得运用各种手段（有些甚至是不正当的）在提高知名度方面投资，就是亏损也要买个“名优”企业的称号。
    如果什么地方重名不重实的风气不扭转，那么作个不太恰当的比喻：那里的改革就好像一口总在沸腾的锅，看起来很热闹，实际上里面除了水，什么也没有煮。
