The rainbow of Mount Kumgang and the tides of the Yalu River – watching the performance of North Korean artists

Zhao Guozheng

Taking a strand of the beautiful rainbow from Mount Kumgang, scooping a handful of the surging tides from the Yalu River, holding high the majesty of Mount Paektu, and cherishing the red heart of Mansu Hill, crystallizing into heart-stirring songs and dances full of emotion – the artists from the friendly country of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have once again brought their exquisite singing and dancing arts to the Chinese people and the audience of Beijing. It not only allows people to enjoy the beauty of art but also makes the second Chinese Art Festival and the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation even more vibrant.

"The Song of General Kim Il-sung" is a song very familiar to the Chinese people. When the curtain of the evening performance slowly opened to the sound of lively drums, the singers of the art troupe sang this song with their powerful voices, stirring the emotions of the audience below. They sang folk songs with a rhythmic and passionate melody. Although the language barrier made it difficult to understand the lyrics, the passionate emotions conveyed seemed to make us feel the hardworking North Korean people's love for life.

The North Korean art troupe visiting China this time is mainly composed of the "Sea of Blood" opera troupe, and outstanding singers and dancers are selected from the Central Art Troupe. Among them are the People's Artist and opera singer Kim Seong-hyeon, the winner of the Paris International Art Competition and Meritorious Artist Cho Chŏng-mi, the Meritorious Artist Baek Deok-hwa, and others such as Son Dae-won and Baek Yun-ji, making the troupe quite powerful. In their repertoire, singing about the people's love for labor and socialism is the theme of their hearts. Songs like "Party, My Mother" and "Two Thousand Li Along the Yalu River" are either soaring and passionate or deeply emotional and gentle. At the same time, they sang Chinese songs with deep affection for the Chinese people, such as "Mother Taught Me a Song," "China, China, the Glorious Sun Never Sets," "The Moon on the Fifteenth Night," and "Returning to My Mother's Home," with correct pronunciation and beautiful melodies, like the clear waters of the Yalu River flowing through the hearts of the audience. Especially the sincere and passionate emotions that burst forth from the heart and soul, striking a strong resonance in the hearts of the listeners.

The singers' songs are moving, and the dancers' performances are like visual music, equally delightful to the eyes. We know that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always valued the cultivation and development of national dance culture and the important role of dance art in the lives of the people. Moreover, the Korean nation is known as the "land of dance." This time, their dance performances are filled with deep cultural connotations and overflowing with the emotions of the masses. "By the Spring" is a dance that may not be unfamiliar to Chinese audiences. It depicts girls drawing water at the spring, sometimes playing with each other, sometimes communicating with the birds in the trees through eye contact, conveying the friendship and empathy between humans and birds, making people laugh uncontrollably; and through this, the pure and warm hearts of the girls are revealed to be very sweet and lovely. "Three-Person Dance" is a dance from the Joseon Dynasty that has been passed down to this day. Although it has a long history, the Korean dancers have given it new life, making it ancient yet evergreen, radiating a youthful charm. The dance rhythm is like the wind and waves, rolling and swift; the performers are agile and lively, like fish playing in the water. The female performer's movements are driven by emotion, and her emotions are conveyed through her movements. Surrounded by the handsome dance moves and exquisite skills of the two male performers, she is like the pistil in a flower, even more extraordinary, earning applause from the entire audience. The dance "Sword Dance," which depicts ancient Korean women defending their country against foreign invaders, is deep and strong compared to the romantic "Three-Person Dance," like waves surging deep in the sea. In the clanging of the swords and the fierce gaze, there is a deep sense of a nation's sacred dignity and spirit. The Chinese and Korean peoples have had similar historical experiences, so when watching this piece, it is particularly easy to resonate emotionally. (Accompanying picture)

    金刚山霓彩　大同江情潮
    ——观朝鲜艺术家的演出
    赵国政
    牵一缕金刚山秀丽的霓彩，掬一捧大同江涌动的情潮，手举着白头山的威仪，心怀着万景台丹心一片，结晶成动人肺腑的歌、情采飞扬的舞——来自友好之邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国艺术团的艺术家们，再次将其精湛的歌舞艺术带给中国人民和首都北京的观众。它不仅使人们饱享艺术之美，也使第二届中国艺术节和建国四十周年的喜庆日子更具光彩。
      《金日成将军之歌》是中国人民十分熟悉的歌曲，当晚会的帷幕在热烈的鼓乐声中徐缓地拉开，艺术团的歌唱家们以嘹亮的歌喉，情潮澎湃地演唱这首歌的时候，台下的观众情不自禁地击掌合鸣。他们演唱的民谣节奏铿锵，沸腾炽热，尽管由于语言的隔阂听不懂歌唱的内容，但透过那热烈的情绪，似乎使我们感受到勤劳的朝鲜人民对生活的热爱。
    这次来华访问演出的朝鲜艺术团是以《血海》歌剧团为主，并从中央艺术团体中抽调出优秀的歌唱家、舞蹈家组成的。其中拥有人民演员、歌剧演唱家金承渊，巴黎国际艺术大赛获奖者、功勋演员赵青美，功勋演员裴德花以及孙大远、裴润姬等，实力相当雄厚。在他们演唱的曲目中，歌唱人民对劳动、对社会主义的赞美，是他们心之所系的主题。如《党啊，我的母亲》、《鸭绿江二千里》等，或高亢激越，或深情委婉。与此同时，他们还怀着对中国人民深厚的情谊，激情满怀地用中文演唱了《妈妈教我一支歌》、《中国中国，光辉的太阳永不落》、《十五的月亮》、《回娘家》等中国歌曲，字正腔圆、优美动听，像清澈的鸭绿江水在观众心床上流淌。尤其是吐之于肺腑、迸发于心灵的那种真挚灼热的情感，在听众的心壁撞击出强烈的共鸣。
    歌唱家们的歌是动人的，而舞蹈家们所表演的舞蹈诚如视觉的音乐，也是那样的悦目。我们知道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一向重视民族舞蹈文化的培植与发展，一向重视舞蹈艺术在群众生活领域里的重要作用，而且朝鲜民族也有着舞蹈之邦的美称。这次他们所表演的舞蹈，每部作品都饱含着民族文化的深厚底蕴，都洋溢着人民大众的生活情感。《在泉边》这个舞蹈对中国观众来说也许并不陌生，它描写姑娘们在泉边汲水时，时而彼此嬉戏，时而通过眼神与树上的小鸟逗趣，传递着人与小鸟之间像朋友似的神交和感应，令人忍俊不禁；并借此把纯净如洗、温馨如梦的少女心灵揭示得十分甜美可爱。《三人舞》是李朝时期延续至今的舞蹈。尽管其历史悠久，但朝鲜舞蹈家们回天有术，又赋予它蓬勃的生机，使之古而不老，荡漾着异彩夺人的青春。舞蹈节奏如风旋浪卷，迭宕而迅疾；表演者机敏灵活，如鱼戏水。那位女演员动从情出，情借动势，在两位男演员的俊秀舞姿和精湛技艺的簇拥映衬下，犹如花中之蕊，更显不凡，博得全场的阵阵掌声。表现古代朝鲜妇女为抵御外侮、保卫祖国的《刀舞》，与颇富浪漫气氛的《三人舞》相比，显得深沉刚健，有如浪涛在大海深处涌动。在琅琅有声的刀器舞动中，在凝眉虎视的眼神里，深蕴着一个民族的神圣尊严和风骨。中国人民和朝鲜人民在历史上有过相同的际遇，因而在观看这个作品时，特别能够引起情感上的共振。（附图片）
