	Short-term Behavior in Land Use

	In recent years, short-term behavior in land resource utilization has been quite serious, primarily manifesting in a focus solely on economic benefits while neglecting social and ecological benefits.

	Taking Pidu District in Chengdu as an example: Pidu District is located in the heart of the Chengdu Plain, upstream of the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area, with excellent agricultural production and ecological conditions. Each year, it produces over 50 million kilograms of commercial grain and over 12 million kilograms of rapeseed, making it a crucial base for commercial grain, oil, and meat production. After implementing the fiscal responsibility system, due to its weak industrial foundation, the district's economic development lagged behind the city's average, becoming a high-yield but poor county. To address the fiscal difficulties and increase agricultural production investment, the county government planned to use 4 square kilometers of land to develop industry by the year 2000. Of this, approximately 3,900 mu (260 hectares) is arable land, which alone would result in a reduction of 3.15 million kilograms of grain production.

	Farmers also exhibit short-term behavior in land management, notably in arbitrarily changing the use of arable land. In 1988, Chengdu City reduced its arable land by 23,132 mu (1,542 hectares), with 13,686 mu (912 hectares) of this reduction due to agricultural structural adjustments, accounting for 59% of the city's total arable land reduction that year. Most of this reduced arable land was converted into forest land and fish ponds. For instance, in Longquanyi District, 8,876 mu (592 hectares) of arable land was converted into orchards and fish ponds in 1988. If this trend continues, by 2026, there will be no arable land left.

	In response to this situation, governments at all levels and relevant management departments should pay sufficient attention and implement practical policies and measures to eliminate short-term behavior in land use.

### 土地利用中的短期行为

　　土地利用中的短期行为
　　四川省成都市　张永扩
    近年来，在土地资源利用中，短期行为十分严重，主要表现为只注重经济效益，忽视社会效益和生态效益。
    以成都市郫县为例：郫县地处成都平原的腹心地带，都江堰自流灌区的上游，农业生产生态条件十分优越。每年收购五千万公斤以上商品粮和一千二百万公斤以上油菜籽，是重要商品粮、油、肉生产基地。实行地方财政包干后，由于原有工业基础薄弱，经济发展速度低于全市平均水平，成为高产穷县。为解决地方财政困难和增加农业生产的投入，县府规划在二○○○年前利用四平方公里土地发展工业，其中耕地约占三千九百亩，仅此就要减产粮食三百一十五万公斤。
    农民经营土地时也有短期行为，突出表现在任意地改变农耕地的利用方向。一九八八年成都市减少耕地二万三千一百三十二亩，其中仅农业结构调整就占去一万三千六百八十六亩，占全市当年耕地减少数的百分之五十九。这些减少的耕地，绝大部分都改做了林地和鱼塘。例如，龙泉驿区一九八八年由耕地改园地、鱼塘八千八百七十六亩，如照此速度发展下去，到二○二六年将不再有一分耕地。
    面对这种情况，各级政府和有关管理部门应该引起充分重视，拿出切实可行的政策措施，消除土地利用中的短期行为。
