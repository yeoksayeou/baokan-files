To many Americans, the cover design of the latest issue of *Newsweek* (October 9) carries a hint of bitterness: against a backdrop of blue sky and white clouds, a Japanese woman dressed in a resplendent kimono stands proudly, her torch ablaze, her pose eerily reminiscent of the iconic "Columbia Girl" logo of the Columbia Pictures Entertainment Company. To her right are several lines of bold, eye-catching text: "Japan Invades Hollywood; Sony Purchases Columbia Pictures for $3.4 Billion; Five Ways to Counter Japan's Trade, Mergers, and Technological Challenges." What emotions will American readers experience as their eyes fall upon this cover?

Columbia Pictures Entertainment Company is an undisputed giant in the world-renowned Hollywood, employing over 2,500 people and operating in film and television production, studio facilities, television program design, information services, and a vast library containing 2,700 films and television programs. For a long time, its business tentacles have reached far and wide across the globe. Moreover, 49% of the company's shares are held by the powerful Coca-Cola Company. Now, *Newsweek* clearly informs its readers: the deal, finalized on September 27, where Sony Company acquired the American Columbia Pictures Entertainment Company, has become the largest acquisition by Japanese entities in the United States to date.

Although Americans have plenty of money, in the money-driven Western society, Sony Company still managed to purchase this significant piece of Hollywood real estate for $3.4 billion. The ambitious Japanese capital seems to be everywhere. In recent days, this news has caused a stir in the United States, and the threat of Japanese economics has once again become a hot topic in American media.

In recent years, with the expansion of Japan's economic power and the appreciation of the yen, Japanese companies have seized the opportunity to launch a massive offensive into various sectors of the American economy. Not to mention that Japan's annual trade surplus with the United States exceeds $50 billion, what is even more unsettling to Americans is the large-scale purchase of American stocks, bonds, real estate, and the "acquisition" of American companies by Japanese entities. It is said that half of the real estate in downtown Los Angeles is now owned by Japanese. For instance, in 1988 alone, Japan bought $16.5 billion worth of real estate and $13 billion worth of company stocks or bonds in the United States. It is no wonder that a recent public opinion poll showed that over 50% of Americans believe that Japan's economic threat to the United States is greater than the military threat posed by the Soviet Union.

In recent years, the United States has employed a combination of soft and hard tactics to counter Japan's challenges, but these efforts have not been enough to withstand the fierce onslaught of Japanese capital. Why is this the case? Describing the state of certain aspects of Sino-American economic relations as relentless pressure and exhaustion might be seen as an exaggeration. However, ultimately, the change of hands of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Company is indeed a microcosm of the shifting balance of economic power between Japan and the United States.

    “日本入侵好莱坞！”
    本报记者　张亮
    对于不少美国人来说，最近一期《新闻周刊》（十月九日）的封面设计不无几分辛酸味：在蓝天白云映衬下，一位身着华丽和服的日本女郎，高举闪光的火炬傲然挺立，而其姿态却又酷似美国哥伦比亚制片娱乐公司的特别标志——“哥伦比亚女郎”。她的右侧是几行格外触目的粗体大字：“日本入侵好莱坞；索尼以三十四亿美元买下哥伦比亚制片娱乐公司；对付（日本）贸易、兼并和技术挑战的五种办法”。当美国读者的视线落在这期封面上时，他们获得的信息将会勾起何种感觉呢？
    哥伦比亚制片娱乐公司在闻名于世的好莱坞是无可争辩的老大，拥有二千五百多名雇员，经营范围包括影视片制作、拍摄场、电视节目设计及资料服务以及一个收藏二千七百部影片和电视片的巨大图书馆，长期以来它的业务触角触及世界的广大地区。而且，该公司百分之四十九的股份掌握在实力雄厚的可口可乐公司之手。而今，《新闻周刊》明确不误地告诉它的读者：九月二十七日拍板成交的索尼公司购买美国哥伦比亚制片娱乐公司的这笔交易，已经成为迄今日本人在美国所进行的最大的一桩兼并。
    尽管美国人有的是钱，但在金钱万能的西方社会，索尼公司还是以三十四亿美元高价在好莱坞买下了这块不小的地盘。雄心勃勃的日本资本简直是无孔不入。连日来，这一消息在美国引起了震动，日本的经济威胁再度成为美国舆论界广为议论的热门话题。
    近些年，随着日本经济实力的膨胀和日元升值，日本公司乘机向美国各行各业大举进攻。且不说日本每年对美贸易盈余高达五百多亿美元，尤令美国人不安的是日本人大量购买美国的股票、债券、房地产，同时还在一口口地“吞并”美国公司，开办独资工厂甚至购买美国的农场。据说，洛杉矶市中心如今竟有一半房地产已归日本人所有。又如，仅在一九八八年日本就在美国买下价值一百六十五亿美元的不动产和一百三十亿美元的公司股票或债券。难怪新近的一次民意调查显示，超过百分之五十的美国人认为，日本对美国的经济威胁比苏联的军事威胁更大。
    为了对付日本的挑战，最近几年美国曾使用过软硬兼施的两手战略，但仍未能抵挡得了日本资本的猛烈进攻。是何缘故呢？用步步进逼和疲于招架来形容日美经济关系的某些状况也许会被认为是言过其实了。但是说到底，哥伦比亚制片娱乐公司的易手，终究还是日美经济实力消长、变化的一个缩影。
