    Remote-Controlled Security Gate: New Anti-Theft Equipment
    According to the needs of courtyard-style and high-rise residential buildings for theft prevention, the Panyu Switch Factory in Guangdong Province has recently developed an electronically remote-controlled automatic security gate.
    This gate is installed at the entrance of a courtyard or a high-rise building. Each resident inside is equipped with an intercom. When a visitor comes, they first press the resident's room number at the gate. The resident can then identify the visitor through the intercom and press a button to automatically open the gate. After the visitor enters, the gate automatically closes. It uses a precise electronic lock and is equipped with an emergency power supply.
