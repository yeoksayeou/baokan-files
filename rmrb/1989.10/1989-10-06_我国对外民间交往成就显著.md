Since the founding of New China, China's work in international civilian friendship has developed rapidly and has become an important part of China's foreign affairs.

The China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries is one of the organizations that have long been engaged in this work. To date, the association has conducted civilian exchanges with more than 140 countries and has established long-term friendly cooperative relations or contacts with organizations in more than 70 of these countries. In addition, by the end of last year, it had coordinated the establishment of 332 pairs of sister cities between China and foreign countries.

In the 1950s and 1960s, there were not many countries that had diplomatic relations with China. Many people in other countries were eager to learn about New China but lacked appropriate channels. Under these circumstances, the association conducted cultural and friendly exchanges with many organizations and individuals from various countries, expanding China's influence and laying the foundation for later establishing diplomatic relations with these countries, playing a role of "promoting official relations through civilian exchanges." For example, the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is a typical case in this regard. After the 1970s, government diplomacy achieved significant successes, and the number of countries establishing diplomatic relations with China increased rapidly. However, civilian diplomacy continued to play its unique role, creating a situation of "official and civilian efforts working together."

Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the association has expanded its work to a broader range of objects and richer content. It has invited and received more than 2,500 delegations from over 100 countries and sent out more than 300 delegations, deepening mutual understanding. In particular, it organized visits to China by financial and business circles through civilian channels, playing a role in bridging connections for China's modernization drive. For example, it introduced more than 3,000 talents from abroad through the sister cities channel, among whom the story of the retired expert Grisch from the Federal Republic of Germany transforming the backward face of Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory was widely circulated in China.

The "giant bee" grapes introduced by Shanghai from Japan have been successfully planted in China and have been promoted nationwide, achieving good economic benefits.

The association also participates in and organizes civilian international and bilateral conferences. Among them, the four sessions of the Sino-Japanese Civilian People's Conference held so far have provided a good opportunity for both sides to discuss important issues in the relationship between the two countries, and their role and influence have been affirmed by people from all walks of life in both countries.

In addition, in 1986, the association actively participated in organizing nearly 20 activities to commemorate the International Year of Peace, which received a good response internationally. The United Nations Secretary-General awarded the association the title of "Peace Messenger."

Furthermore, mutual dispatch of cultural and artistic troupes, holding major commemorative activities, and conducting external publicity are also important daily work contents of the association. The active role played by the China People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries in foreign exchanges proves that "civilian diplomacy" has great potential.

    我国对外民间交往成就显著
    宗延
    新中国成立以来，我国的对外民间友好工作发展迅速，已经成为我国对外工作的重要的组成部分。
    中国人民对外友好协会是长期在这方面开展工作的组织之一。迄今对外友协已同140多个国家开展了民间交往，同其中70多个国家的组织建立了长期友好合作关系或联系。此外，截至去年底，经它协调我国同外国建立的友好城市已有332对。
    在50和60年代，同我国有外交关系的国家还不多，许多国家人民渴望了解新中国而又苦于缺少适当渠道。在这种情况下，对外友协以文化、友好交流等形式同许多国家的组织和人士进行往来，扩大了我国的影响，也为后来同这些国家建交奠定了基础，起到了“以民促官”的作用。例如，实现中日邦交正常化就是这方面的一个典型例证。70年代以后，政府外交取得了重大成就，与我国建交的国家迅速增加，而民间外交则继续发挥着特有的作用，出现了“官民并举，相辅相成”的局面。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，对外友协开展工作的对象更加广泛、内容也更加丰富。它邀请并接待了100多个国家的各种团组2500多批，派出团组300多批，加深了相互了解。特别是它通过民间渠道组织了财经界和企业界人士访华，为我国四化建设起了牵线搭桥的作用。例如，它通过友好城市渠道从国外引进各类人才达3000人，其中，联邦德国退休专家格里希改变武汉柴油机厂落后面貌的事迹曾在我国广为流传。
    上海市从日本引进的“巨蜂”葡萄在我国种植成功，并已推广到全国，获得很好的经济效益。
    友协还参加和举办民间性的国际和双边会议。其中，已经举行过四次的中日民间人士会议为双方深入地讨论两国关系中的重要问题提供了良好的机会，其作用与影响得到了两国各界人士的肯定。
    另外，1986年，由对外友协积极参与举办了“中国人民维护世界和平大会”等近20项纪念国际和平年的活动，国际上引起了良好的反应。联合国秘书长为此授予对外友协“和平使者”称号。
    另外，同外国互派文化艺术团组，举办重大纪念活动，开展对外宣传等，也是友协日常的重要工作内容。中国人民对外友好协会在对外交往方面所起的积极作用证明，“民间外交”是大有可为的。
