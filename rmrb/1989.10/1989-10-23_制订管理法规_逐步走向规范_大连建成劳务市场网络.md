Dalian places great importance on leveraging the regulatory role of the labor market to promote the optimal combination of labor resources. Since 1987, Dalian has, under the leadership and organization of the city, established over 10 comprehensive labor markets and more than 100 street and township service stations within the city and its affiliated counties and districts. Additionally, internal labor markets have been set up in some enterprises, forming an initial multi-layered and multi-formatted labor market network across the city.

To further improve the labor market, Dalian has issued more than ten management regulations, including the "Measures for Strengthening the Management of Labor Markets" and the "Interim Measures for Labor Supervision." The city has also hired 860 labor information officers from various counties, districts, and relevant bureaus and enterprises to regularly provide labor information to the city's labor market, gradually moving towards standardization. At the same time, Dalian has formulated the "Management Measures for External Labor Force," incorporating external labor into the labor market management.

The labor market has also effectively addressed the issue of job placement for vocational high school graduates. The employment rate of vocational high school graduates in Dalian has exceeded 95% for three consecutive years.

　　大连建成劳务市场网络
    据新华社大连10月22日电　（记者李小林）大连市重视发挥劳务市场的调节作用，促进劳动力的最佳组合。
    1987年以来，大连市有领导、有组织地在市内和所属县、区陆续建立了10多个综合性劳务市场和100多个街道及乡镇服务站，并在一些企业建立了内部劳务市场，初步形成全市性的多层次、多形式的劳务市场网络。
    为了进一步完善劳务市场，大连市还先后颁布了《加强劳务市场管理办法》、《劳务监察暂行办法》等十多个管理法规；从各县、区及各主管局和企事业单位聘请了860名劳动信息员，定期向市劳务市场提供劳务信息，使劳务市场逐步走向规范化。同时，大连市还制定了《外来劳动力管理办法》，将外来劳动力纳入劳务市场管理。
    劳务市场还较好地解决了职业高中毕业生分配难的问题，大连市职业高中毕业生就业率连续3年超过95％。
