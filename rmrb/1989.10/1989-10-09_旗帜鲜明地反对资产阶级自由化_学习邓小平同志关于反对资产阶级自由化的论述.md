Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made a series of important statements on adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. However, his correct policy of opposing bourgeois liberalization has not been consistently and steadfastly implemented, leading to the escalation of this trend. Recently, the counter-revolutionary riots and disturbances in Beijing were the result of the long-term spread of bourgeois liberalization. Bourgeois liberalization is the root of the disturbances and the biggest obstacle to socialist modernization. Now, it is particularly important and far-reaching to re-study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks on opposing bourgeois liberalization.

What is bourgeois liberalization? Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly pointed out: "To engage in bourgeois liberalization is to take the capitalist road." (Enlarged Edition of "Building Socialism with Chinese Characteristics," p. 109, hereafter referred to as the Enlarged Edition) "The core of bourgeois liberalization is to oppose the Party's leadership, and without the Party's leadership, there will be no socialist system." (Deng Xiaoping Selected Works, p. 346, hereafter, all references to this book will only indicate the page number)

Bourgeois liberalization concentrates on doubting and denying the four cardinal principles. Those who engage in bourgeois liberalization brazenly make anti-Party and anti-socialist statements. Their interest is not in criticizing capitalism but in "guiding people to criticize, doubt, and deny socialism, making people lose confidence in the future of socialism and communism." (Enlarged Edition, p. 29) On the other hand, they advocate wholesale Westernization, wanting to bring the entire capitalist system of the West to China. Sometimes, they also talk about the four modernizations and support reform and opening up, but they do not mention the precondition of socialism. In reality, they advocate bringing over the entire capitalist system, aiming to lead us onto the capitalist road.

The core of bourgeois liberalization is to oppose the Party's leadership. A few people engaging in bourgeois liberalization spread various statements to defame the Party's image and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China. They advocate "three powers in balance" and the establishment of a multi-party system. During this counter-revolutionary riot, a few people openly shouted, "Overthrow the Communist Party," "Eliminate the 47 million Communist Party members," and "Invite the Kuomintang back to the mainland to establish a two-party system." In addition, they spread a large amount of speech opposing people's democratic dictatorship and Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, not only denying the four cardinal principles item by item but also completely denying them in total, openly calling for the removal of the four cardinal principles from the constitution.

Another major tactic of engaging in bourgeois liberalization is to spread spiritual pollution. In this regard, the most prominent manifestation is the eagerness to write dark, gray, and even fabricated stories that distort revolutionary history and reality. Regarding Western philosophy, economics, social politics, and literary and artistic trends, they do not analyze, discriminate, or criticize but blindly praise them. Even some books, films, music, dances, as well as videos and audios that are considered low-level, vulgar, or harmful in Western countries have been imported in large numbers in recent years. This spiritual pollution extensively promotes bourgeois individualism and a certain range of anarchism, the worship of money, the pursuit of profit, bourgeois decadent lifestyle, bourgeois moral and artistic standards, and the admiration for the capitalist system and the capitalist world, etc., aiming to fundamentally deny, oppose, and sabotage China's socialist cause, oppose and sabotage the leadership of the Communist Party of China over China's socialist cause, and implement the so-called bourgeois freedom system.

One of the vicious tactics of engaging in bourgeois liberalization is to plan and incite disturbances. A few people with ulterior motives use various means to lure, deceive, bewitch, and incite some politically naive and inexperienced young students to join illegal organizations, publish illegal publications, parade, sit-in, and storm Party and government offices. Comrade Deng Xiaoping solemnly pointed out: "What they do is just big noise, big release, big-character posters, and illegal publications. In reality, it is a kind of disturbance, a legacy of the 'Cultural Revolution.'" (Enlarged Edition, p. 110) This disturbance and counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing is a major exposure of the bourgeois liberalization virus.

How should we view bourgeois liberalization? Over the years, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly reminded Party members and non-Party members to fully recognize the serious harm of bourgeois liberalization. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, when the trend of liberalization first appeared, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech "Uphold the Four Cardinal Principles": "There are a few people in society who are spreading the trend of doubting or opposing the four cardinal principles, and there are also a few comrades within the Party who not only do not acknowledge the danger of this trend but even directly or indirectly support it to a certain extent. Although these people are a small minority within and outside the Party, we cannot ignore their influence because they are a minority. The facts have proven that they have not only caused but are already causing great harm to our cause." (p. 152) In many subsequent speeches, Comrade Deng Xiaoping discussed this harm from at least five aspects: First, he believed that although those who adhere to the bourgeois liberalization position are only a small minority, the atmosphere they create provides conditions for the reactionary forces at home and abroad that oppose our socialist system, for some criminal elements, smashers, looters, and remnants of the "Gang of Four" to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Although these few people have different natures, they can completely unite under certain conditions, and with the opening up, many bad things will inevitably come in, and once combined, it is an unavoidable and significant impact on our socialist four modernizations. Second, he believed that engaging in bourgeois liberalization would only lead to national chaos and disintegration of public opinion, and eventually, there would be trouble. He reminded people to see that the biggest need in China is stability. Without a stable environment, everything will be blown away, and the achievements we have already made will also be lost. Third, he believed that engaging in bourgeois liberalization would inevitably reduce the Party's prestige and disintegrate the Party's organization, making such a Party not even as good as a mass organization, how could it lead the people to build? Fourth, he believed that bourgeois liberalization confuses people's minds and pollutes people's souls. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The harm of spiritual pollution is great, enough to bring disaster to the country and mislead the people. It confuses the boundaries of right and wrong among the people, creates a negative and disintegrating, disloyal, and disunited sentiment, corrupts people's souls and wills, and promotes the spread of various individualistic thoughts, and promotes the trend of doubting and even denying socialism and the Party's leadership among a part of the people," (Enlarged Edition, p. 32) if left unchecked, it would affect more young people to lose their way and go astray. In the long run, the struggle against bourgeois liberalization is related to who will take over our cause, and it is related to the fate and future of the Party and the state. Fifth, he believed that engaging in bourgeois liberalization would inevitably make the four modernizations lose direction and take the capitalist path. Comrade Deng Xiaoping believed that our four modernizations have a name, that is, socialist four modernizations. Because starting from China's national conditions, once socialism is abandoned, it will return to the old path of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism, and the four modernizations will definitely not be realized, and there may even be a revolution. If the entire system of the West is brought to China, this is actually to lead China's current policies to take the capitalist road, and what China is doing is not modernization but capitalistization.

Why does bourgeois liberalization have such a large market? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that an important reason is that those who engage in bourgeois liberalization always hide their conspiracies under various revolutionary banners, making it easy for many naive young people and the public who do not know the truth to be deceived.

Those who engage in bourgeois liberalization use the tasks and slogans put forward by our Party to spread views that deny the four cardinal principles, which is one of their usual tricks. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee proposed to emancipate the mind and rectify the past, some people with ulterior motives used the banner of emancipating the mind, under the pretext of correcting the mistakes of Chairman Mao's later years, denied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and under the pretext of correcting the "leftist" mistakes of the Party during the ten years of turmoil, denied the Party's leadership. Regarding this, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out: "When we talk about emancipating the mind, it is to break free from the constraints of habitual forces and subjective biases under the guidance of Marxism to study new situations and solve new problems. Emancipating the mind cannot deviate from the track of the four cardinal principles, cannot damage the political situation of stability, unity, and liveliness." "If like the people on 'Xidan Wall,' they emancipate the mind without the four cardinal principles, they actually put themselves in opposition to the Party and the people." (p. 243) After the Twelfth National Congress, China fully implemented the policy of reform and opening up. Those who engage in bourgeois liberalization again used the appearance of reform and opening up to criticize and deny socialism, advocating "wholesale Westernization," attempting to bring the entire capitalist system of the West into China. In short, no matter what tasks and slogans you propose, as long as they think they can use them, they will immediately raise the banner and make a fuss. You talk about opposing feudalism, and they will oppose socialism as feudalism. You talk about improving the Party's leadership, and they will talk about implementing a multi-party system and "three powers in balance." You talk about strengthening the legal system and promoting democratic construction, and they will talk about abstract "democracy, freedom, human rights," etc. All these should alert the entire Party, the entire nation, and the entire youth to be sufficiently vigilant!

Using certain mistakes and problems in the work of the Party and the government to incite a part of the students and the public who have good intentions to be dissatisfied with the Party is a usual tactic of those who engage in bourgeois liberalization. Before and after the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, they used some social problems left over from the "Gang of Four" era to easily deceive a part of the public who are currently in difficulty and the government cannot completely solve it. In recent years, they have used some mistakes in the work of the Party and the government and the existence of some corruption to incite the broad masses of young students and the public to be dissatisfied and distrustful of the Party and the government. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech to the martial law troops at the corps level and above that the most deceptive trick used by a few conspirators in the disturbances and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing this time was to use the slogan of "opposing corruption" as a cover, dragging a considerable number of students and the public who have good intentions into this turmoil of bourgeois liberalization and the four cardinal principles.

Another tactic is to use the banner of the "democratic movement" to incite student movements and create disturbances. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: Those who create incidents, "generally use the so-called democratic banner, which is very easy to confuse people." (p. 160) He pointed out that we must emphasize to the people and youth that the democracy China needs today can only be socialist democracy, not bourgeois individualistic democracy, can only be people's democracy under the centralized leadership of the Communist Party, not anarchistic democracy without the leadership of the Communist Party; can only be democracy combined with socialist legal system, not lawless "big democracy." If we deviate from the four cardinal principles and talk about democracy in an abstract and empty way, it will inevitably lead to the serious spread of ultra-democracy and anarchism, leading to the complete destruction of the political situation of stability and unity, leading to the complete failure of the four modernizations. As long as we establish such a democratic consciousness in our minds, we can enhance our ability to discern and resist bourgeois liberalization and not be deceived by the banner of "demanding democracy."

This is a thought that Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized in his remarks on opposing bourgeois liberalization. He believed that the reason why bourgeois liberalization has become more and more rampant over the years is that the opposition to bourgeois liberalization is not resolute, consistent, and thorough. As early as July 1981, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in response to the situation where some obvious errors against the four cardinal principles were not forcefully exposed and fought against after he made a speech on upholding the four cardinal principles, pointed out: "The main problem at present is not that there are these phenomena, but that we are powerless to deal with these phenomena, and there is a state of dispersion and weakness." (p. 345) Later, he repeatedly warned some comrades within the Party to decide to overcome the situation where the attitude towards opposing bourgeois liberalization is not resolute and the banner is not clear. At the end of 1986, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in response to the incident where Fang Lizhi and others incited students to make trouble, once again warned: "Wherever there is trouble, it is because the leadership's attitude is not resolute and the banner is not clear. This is not a problem of one or two places, nor is it a problem of one or two years, but the result of the banner not being clear and the attitude not being resolute in opposing the trend of bourgeois liberalization over the past few years." (Enlarged Edition, p. 149) After Zhao Ziyang took charge of the central work, he did not learn from the previous lessons and continued to adopt a laissez-faire, and even indulgent and supportive attitude towards bourgeois liberalization, resulting in the development of the trend of bourgeois liberalization to the point of causing a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing.

To truly fight well against bourgeois liberalization, we must fundamentally change the weak and dispersed situation on the ideological front. Comrade Deng Xiaoping believed that to clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, we must let socialist ideology occupy the ideological front, actively and seriously carry out ideological struggles against various erroneous views of bourgeois liberalization, and truly reverse the abnormal situation where "critics are attacked, those criticized are often sympathized and protected," "good people do not get support, bad people are very rampant" (Enlarged Edition, p. 150). At the Second Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee held in October 1983, he loudly called: "Strengthening the Party's leadership on the ideological front, overcoming the weak and dispersed state, has become an urgent task for the entire Party." (Enlarged Edition, p. 36) "Party committees at all levels, especially the main responsible comrades of party committees, should closely monitor and deeply study the situation and problems on the ideological front, and take effective measures to improve the work on this front." He also suggested that the Political Bureau of the Central Committee or the Secretariat of the Central Committee hold a special discussion on the work of the Party's ideological front, systematically solving the relevant policies, tasks, measures, and steps.

To fight well against bourgeois liberalization, leading cadres must be clear and resolute, and Communist Party members must stand at the forefront of the struggle. Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly talked about the fact that whether a unit or a region can clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization depends on whether the main leading cadres and the main responsible comrades of the Party committee are resolute in their attitude. He said: "The leadership must be clear, and the masses will be able to see clearly," the leadership "has a clear attitude, giving active elements a boost, and the middle masses will be able to stand up. The leadership's attitude is resolute, and there will be no trouble." (Enlarged Edition, p. 153) This argument is very correct. If Zhao Ziyang had stood on the Party's side throughout the turmoil in Beijing this time, clearly opposing the disturbance, the student movement would not have developed into a disturbance, and the disturbance would not have developed into a counter-revolutionary riot. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his remarks on opposing bourgeois liberalization, emphasized that Party members must maintain consistency with the Central Committee of the Party. He pointed out that Party members' criticism of the Party must be in accordance with the Party's principles, abide by the Party's decisions, and not allow the spread of distrust, dissatisfaction, and opposition to the Party's line, policy, and policy, especially Party members who are writers, artists, theoretical workers, news workers, and those engaged in other ideological work, must strengthen their Party spirit, abide by the Party's constitution and discipline, and not allow themselves to be special and do as they please. They must "always and consciously put the overall situation first and strive tirelessly to improve the socialist awareness of the people and youth." (p. 220) "Communist Party members on the ideological front, especially those who are responsible for leadership and have influence in this field, must stand at the forefront of the struggle." (Enlarged Edition, p. 34) Many years of practice have proven that the leaders of bourgeois liberalization often come from within the Party. As long as all Communist Party members can consciously strengthen their Party spirit, abide by the Party's discipline and constitution, and take the lead in fighting against bourgeois liberalization, various liberalization problems on the ideological front can be solved and are not difficult to solve.

To clearly oppose liberalization, we must also overcome some confused ideas and firmly adhere to the correct direction of opposing bourgeois liberalization. Some comrades are hesitant and unclear in opposing bourgeois liberalization, an important reason is that there are some confused things in their ideological understanding. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, some people are afraid that opposing bourgeois liberalization will affect the implementation of the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, some people are worried that opposing bourgeois liberalization will affect the emancipation of the mind, some people are also concerned that opposing bourgeois liberalization will hinder reform and opening up, and some people are afraid of being said to be launching a political movement again. Comrade Deng Xiaoping believed that this confused situation indeed provided some favorable conditions for the activities of those who are eager for chaos, making those who engage in bourgeois liberalization more arrogant in attacking the four cardinal principles. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively correct this and firmly and justly fight against bourgeois liberalization.

From Comrade Deng Xiaoping's many remarks, we can see that in the process of China's reform and opening up, while absorbing and learning some scientific and technological achievements and everything useful from some developed capitalist countries, some negative influences of capitalist society are inevitably brought in. Therefore, in the situation where class struggle still exists to a certain extent in China and foreign bourgeois ideology continues to have an impact, especially in the situation where China's economic development will remain backward compared to Western developed capitalist countries for a relatively long period, and the superiority of socialism has not been fully demonstrated, bourgeois liberalization thought and its influence will be very stubbornly reflected in the political and ideological field, and as a social trend, it will exist for a long time. Therefore, the struggle against bourgeois liberalization will inevitably be a long-term struggle. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, as long as there is reform and opening up, there must be opposition to bourgeois liberalization. "This struggle will run through the entire process of achieving the four modernizations, not only in this century but also in the next century." (Comrade Deng Xiaoping on Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization, PLA Press, June 1989, 1st Edition, p. 172) The facts have proven that the representatives of the trend of bourgeois liberalization will never give up their dream of overthrowing the Communist Party and taking the capitalist road in China. They will still make trouble when they encounter a suitable domestic and international climate. For this, the entire Party, the entire nation, and the entire army must be fully prepared in terms of ideology.

The means to oppose bourgeois liberalization should adapt to the needs of long-term struggle and should mainly be education. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "Precisely because the struggle is long-term, we do not launch a movement, mainly to carry out education. It is both a process of struggle and a process of persuasion and education." (Ibid) He repeatedly reminded people to learn from the lessons of the past "leftist" approach, and for those who make mistakes in the trend of bourgeois liberalization, the nature and degree of each person's mistake, how they recognize it, and how to deal with it, all should be distinguished and appropriate. The method of criticism should be refined, the degree should be appropriate, and there should be no attacks or movements, but the weapon of criticism must not be abandoned. While emphasizing education as the main approach, Comrade Deng Xiaoping also believed that "if someone makes us always restless, we cannot rule out the use of certain dictatorial means, using disciplinary and legal means." (Ibid, p. 181) "If it affects social order and violates criminal law, it must be dealt with decisively. Guidance, including legal handling." (Enlarged Edition, p. 149) We cannot yield on this issue.

To engage in long-term struggle against bourgeois liberalization, we must long-term educate the youth and the people. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in early 1987 that in recent years, "the guidance of young students has been weak, which is a major mistake." (Enlarged Edition, p. 154) At the beginning of this year, he again pointed out that in the past ten years, our biggest mistake has been in education. Here, the education mentioned is mainly the ideological and political education of the broad masses of young people. Due to this mistake, some young students, under the influence and corruption of bourgeois liberalization thought, do not listen to or believe in the truth that only socialism can save China and develop China, but believe in the propaganda of the good aspects of capitalism. A few people who stubbornly adhere to the position of bourgeois liberalization incite them to make trouble, and even lose their reason. This serious fact tells us that in the long-term struggle between adhering to the four cardinal principles and engaging in bourgeois liberalization, winning over the youth is a very prominent aspect. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that student disturbances, "cannot be dealt with by just patting them on the shoulder. We must make the right and wrong clear, and make the benefits and harms clear. Right and wrong involve the fundamental interests of our country, and benefits and harms involve the fundamental goals of our socialist country, that is, whether we can achieve our goals in this century and the next century. This is the real care and sincere guidance for the youth." (Enlarged Edition, p. 156) Otherwise, only flattering young students, only praising their "good intentions" and "patriotic actions," can only encourage them to blindly follow bourgeois liberalization, which is actually a harm to young students.

    旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化
    ——学习邓小平同志关于反对资产阶级自由化的论述
    柏轩
    党的十一届三中全会以来，邓小平同志对坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化作了一系列重要论述。但是，他提出的反对资产阶级自由化的正确方针，没有得到坚定不移、始终如一地贯彻执行，致使这种思潮愈演愈烈。不久前，北京发生的反党反社会主义的动乱和反革命暴乱，就是资产阶级自由化思潮长期泛滥的恶果。资产阶级自由化是动乱之源，是社会主义现代化建设的最大障碍。现在，重新学习邓小平同志关于反对资产阶级自由化的论述，有着特别重要而深远的意义。
    搞资产阶级自由化就是走资本主义道路
    什么是资产阶级自由化？邓小平同志多次明确地指出：“搞资产阶级自由化，就是走资本主义道路。”　（《建设有中国特色的社会主义》增订本，第109页，以下简称增订本）“资产阶级自由化的核心就是反对党的领导，而没有党的领导也就不会有社会主义制度。”
　（《邓小平文选》第346页，以下凡引自此书的均只注明页码）
    资产阶级自由化集中怀疑和否定四项基本原则。搞资产阶级自由化的人，放肆地发表反党反社会主义的言论，他们的兴趣不在批评资本主义，而在“引导人们去批评、怀疑和否定社会主义，使人们对社会主义、共产主义的前途失去信心。”
  （增订本第29页）另一方面，他们主张全盘西化，要把西方资本主义制度全盘搬到中国来。他们有时虽然也提搞四个现代化，拥护改革开放，但是根本不讲社会主义这个前提，实际是主张把资本主义一整套制度都拿过来，要把我们引导到资本主义道路上去。
    资产阶级自由化的核心就是反对党的领导。极少数搞资产阶级自由化的人散布种种言论，丑化党的形象，反对中国共产党的领导。他们鼓吹“三权鼎立”，建立多党政治。这次反革命暴乱中，极少数人就公开叫喊“打倒共产党”、“消灭四千七百万共产党党徒”、“邀请国民党回大陆建立两党政治”。除此而外，他们还散布了大量反对人民民主专政和马列主义、毛泽东思想的言论，不仅一项一项地而且从总体上彻底否定四项基本原则，公开叫嚷要从宪法上“去除”四项基本原则。
    其次，搞资产阶级自由化的一个主要手法，就是搞精神污染。这个方面的突出表现，是热心于写阴暗的、灰色的、以至胡编乱造歪曲革命的历史和现实的东西，对于西方的哲学、经济学、社会政治和文学艺术思潮，不分析、不鉴别、不批判，而是一味地盲目推崇。甚至连一些在西方国家也认为低级庸俗或者有害的书籍、电影、音乐、舞蹈以及录相、录音，这几年也输入了不少。这种精神污染大肆宣扬资产阶级的个人主义和一定范围内的无政府主义，资产阶级的金钱崇拜，唯利是图的思想和行为，资产阶级腐朽的生活方式，资产阶级的道德标准和艺术标准，以及对于资本主义制度和资本主义世界的崇拜，等等，企图从根本上否认、反对和破坏中国的社会主义事业，反对和破坏中国共产党对于中国社会主义事业的领导，实行资产阶级的所谓自由制度。
    搞资产阶级自由化的一个恶毒手法就是策划鼓动闹学潮，搞动乱。极少数别有用心的人，采取种种手段引诱、欺骗、蛊惑、煽动一些政治上幼稚、没有经验的青年学生参加非法组织，出版非法刊物，游行示威，静坐绝食，冲击党政机关。邓小平同志严肃地指出：“他们搞的这一套无非是大鸣、大放、大字报、出非法刊物，实际上是一种动乱，是‘文化大革命’遗留下来的作风。”　（增订本第 110页）这次北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱，是资产阶级自由化病毒的大暴露。
      对资产阶级自由化的严重危害不可低估
    怎样看待资产阶级自由化？多年来，邓小平同志反复提醒党内外的同志，要充分认识资产阶级自由化的严重危害。在党的十一届三中全会后刚刚出现自由化思潮的时候，邓小平同志就在《坚持四项基本原则》的讲话中指出：“社会上有极少数人正在散布怀疑或反对这四项基本原则的思潮，而党内也有个别同志不但不承认这种思潮的危险，甚至直接间接地加以某种程度的支持。虽然这几种人在党内外都是极少数，但是不能因为他们是极少数而忽视他们的作用。事实证明，他们不但可以而且已经对我们的事业造成很大的危害。”　（第152页）在以后许多次讲话中，邓小平同志至少从五个方面论述了这种危害：一是认为坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人虽然只是极少数，但是他们制造的气氛，为国内外敌视我国社会主义制度的反动
  势力，为一些刑事犯罪分子、打砸抢分子和“四人帮”的残渣余孽进行反党反社会主义活动提供了条件。尽管这几种人的性
  质不同，但是在一定条件下，他们完全可以纠合在一起，加上
  开放必然进来许多乌七八糟的东西，一结合起来，是一种不可
  忽视的、对我们社会主义四个现代化的冲击。二是认为搞资产
  阶级自由化，只会出现国家混乱、人心涣散的局面，迟早都会
  出乱子。他提醒人们要看到中国的问题，压倒一切的需要是稳
  定。没有稳定的环境，什么都吹了，已经取得的成果，也会失
  去。三是认为搞资产阶级自由化，必然降低党的威信，涣散党
  的组织，那样的党连个群众团体也不如，怎么能领导人民搞建
  设？四是认为资产阶级自由化搞乱人们的思想，污染人们的灵
  魂。邓小平同志指出：“精神污染的危害很大，足以祸国误
  民。它在人民中混淆是非界限，造成消极涣散、离心离德的情
  绪，腐蚀人们的灵魂和意志，助长形形色色的个人主义思想泛
  滥，助长一部分人当中怀疑以至否定社会主义和党的领导的思
  潮”，　（增订本第32页）如果任其自由泛滥，就会影响更多青
  年人迷失方向走上邪路。从长远来说，反对资产阶级自由化的
  斗争，关系到我们的事业将由什么样的一代人来接班，关系到
  党和国家的命运和前途。五是认为搞资产阶级自由化必然使四
  化建设迷失方向，走上资本主义歧途。邓小平同志认为，我们
  搞的四个现代化有个名字，也就是社会主义四个现代化。因为
  从中国的国情出发，一旦抛弃社会主义，就要回到半殖民地半封建的老路上去，四个现代化肯定实现不了，甚至还会发生闹革命的问题。如果把西方一套制度全都搬到中国来，这实际上就是要把中国现行的政策引到走资本主义道路，中国搞的就不是现代化了，而是资本主义化了。
    资产阶级自由化有极大的欺骗性
    资产阶级自由化为什么能有那么大的市场呢？邓小平同志指出，一个很重要的原因，那就是搞资产阶级自由化的人总是打着种种革命的旗号，把他们的阴谋隐藏起来，容易使许多幼稚的青年人和不了解真相的群众受骗上当。
    搞资产阶级自由化的人借着我们党所提出的任务和口号来散布否定四项基本原则的观点，这是他们惯用的一个伎俩。党的十一届三中全会提出解放思想、拨乱反正以后，一些别有用心的人打着解放思想的旗号，以纠正毛主席晚年的错误为名，否定马列主义毛泽东思想，以纠正党在十年内乱中的极“左”错误为名否定党的领导。对此，邓小平同志明确地指出：“我们讲解放思想，是指在马克思主义指导下打破习惯势力和主观偏见的束缚，研究新情况，解决新问题。解放思想不能够偏离四项基本原则的轨道，不能损害安定团结、生动活泼的政治局面。”“如果像‘西单墙’的一些人那样，离开四项基本原则去‘解放思想’，实际上是把自己放到党和人民的对立面去了。”　（第243页）党的十二大以后，我国全面执行改革开放政策，搞资产阶级自由化的人又以改革和开放的面目批评和否定社会主义，主张“全盘西化”，企图把西方资本主义制度完整地搬进中国来。总之，不管你提出什么任务和口号，他们只要觉得可以利用，就立即扯起旗号搞名堂。你讲要反对封建主义，他就把社会主义当成封建主义来反对。你讲要改善党的领导，他就讲实行多党政治，搞“三权鼎立”。你讲要加强法制、推进民主建设，他就大讲抽象的“民主、自由、人权”等等。所有这些都应该引起全党、全国人民和全国青年的足够警惕！
    利用党和政府工作上存在的某些失误和问题，挑动一部分有善良愿望的学生和群众对党不满，是搞资产阶级自由化的人的惯用的手法。党的十一届三中全会前后，他们利用林彪“四人帮”时期遗留下来的一些社会问题，很容易蒙蔽一部分目前有困难而政府一时还不能完全予以解决的群众。这几年，他们则利用党和政府在工作中的某些失误和存在的一些腐败现象，煽动广大青年学生和群众对党和政府的不满和不信任的情绪。邓小平同志在接见戒严部队军以上干部的讲话中指出，这次北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱中，极少数阴谋策划者使用的最迷惑人的一招，就是以“反对腐败”的口号为陪衬，把相当一部分有善良愿望的学生和群众裹胁到这场资产阶级自由化同四项基本原则对立的风波之中。
    还有一个手法，就是以“民主运动”为旗号，煽动学潮，制造动乱。邓小平同志说：那些制造事端的人，“一般都打着所谓民主的幌子，很容易淆惑视听。”　（第160页）他指出，一定要向人民和青年着重讲清民主问题，使他们认清中国人民今天需要的民主只能是社会主义民主，而不是资产阶级的个人主义的民主，只能是共产党集中领导下的人民民主，而不是摆脱共产党领导的无政府主义的民主；只能是与社会主义法制结合起来的民主，而不是无法无天的“大民主”。如果离开四项基本原则，抽象地空谈民主，那就必然会造成极端民主化和无政府主义的严重泛滥，导致安定团结政治局面的彻底破坏，导致四个现代化的彻底失败。只要我们在头脑中树立起这样的民主意识，就能增强识别和抵制资产阶级自由化的能力，不被“要民主”的旗号所迷惑。
    反对资产阶级自由化必须旗帜鲜明
    这是邓小平同志关于反对资产阶级自由化论述中反复强调的一个思想。他认为，多年来资产阶级自由化之所以愈演愈烈，就是因为反对资产阶级自由化不坚决，不一贯，不彻底。早在1981年7月，邓小平同志针对宣传工作在他做了坚持四项基本原则的讲话以后，对一些明显反对四项基本原则的错误观点没有进行有力地揭露和斗争，致使这种错误思潮又重新出现的情况，严肃地指出：“当前的主要问题不在于有这些现象，而在于我们对这些现象处置无力，存在着涣散软弱的状态。”　（第345页）以后他又多次告诫党内一些同志，要下决心克服反对资产阶级自由化态度不坚决、旗帜不鲜明的状况。1986年底，邓小平同志针对方励之等人煽动学生闹事的事件再一次警告说：“凡是闹得起来的地方，都是因为那里的领导态度不坚决，旗帜不鲜明。这也不是一个两个地方的问题，也不是一年两年的问题，是几年来反对资产阶级自由化思潮旗帜不鲜明、态度不坚决的结果。”　（增订本第149页）赵紫阳同志主持中央工作后并没有吸取以前的教训，继续对资产阶级自由化采取放任，甚至纵容和支持的态度，结果使资产阶级自由化思潮发展到在北京发生了反革命暴乱这样的地步。
    要真正搞好反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，就要彻底改变思想战线软弱涣散的状况。邓小平同志认为，要旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，就必须让社会主义思想占领思想战线阵地，对资产阶级自由化的种种错误观点展开积极的严肃的思想斗争，真正扭转那种“批评者被围攻，被批评者往往受到同情和保护”、“好人得不到支持，坏人猖狂得很”　（增订本第150页）的不正常的局面。他在1983年10月召开的党的十二届二中全会上大声疾呼：“加强党对思想战线的领导，克服软弱涣散状态，已经成为全党的一个迫切的任务。”　（增订本第36页）
  “各级党委，首先是党委的主要负责同志，要密切注视和深入研究思想战线的形势和问题，采取切实有效的办法改进这条战线的工作。”他还建议中央政治局或中央书记处就党的思想战线工作进行专门讨论，系统解决有关的方针、任务、措施和步骤等问题。
    搞好反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，领导干部首先要旗帜鲜明，共产党员要站在斗争的前列。邓小平同志多次谈到，一个单位、一个地区反对资产阶级自由化能否旗帜鲜明，关键在于那里的主要领导干部，党委的主要负责人是否态度坚决。他说：“领导要旗帜鲜明，群众才能擦亮眼睛”，领导“态度鲜明了，给积极分子鼓了气，中间群众才能站过来。领导态度坚决了，就闹不起来了。”　（增订本第153页）这一论断是非常正确的。如果赵紫阳同志在北京这次发生的风波中，始终站在党的立场上，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，根本不会从学潮发展成为动乱，进而又由动乱发展为反革命暴乱。邓小平同志在反对资产阶级自由化的论述中，十分强调党员要同党中央保持一致。他指出，党员对党的批评要合乎党的原则，遵守党的决定，不允许对党的路线、方针、政策任意散布不信任、不满和反对的意见，特别是党员中的作家、艺术家、思想理论工作者、新闻工作者和从事其他意识形态工作的同志，更要增强党性，遵守党的章程和纪律，不允许自视特殊，自行其是。要“经常地、自觉地以大局为重，为提高人民和青年的社会主义觉悟奋斗不懈。”（第220页）“思想战线上的共产党员，特别是这方面担负领导责任的和有影响的共产党员，必须站在斗争的前列。”　（增订本第34页）多年来的实践证明，搞资产阶级自由化的头面人物往往就出在党内。只要所有的共产党员都能自觉增强党性，遵守党的纪律和章程，并带头同资产阶级自由化作斗争，思想战线上的种种自由化问题都是可以解决的，也是不难解决的。
    旗帜鲜明地反对自由化，还要克服一些糊涂认识，坚定反对资产阶级自由化的正确方向。有些同志在反对资产阶级自由化上之所以缩手缩脚，旗帜不鲜明，一个很重要的原因是思想认识上存在一些混乱的东西。正像邓小平同志所指出的那样，有的人怕反对资产阶级自由化会影响“双百方针”的贯彻，有的人担心反对资产阶级自由化会影响解放思想，有的人还顾虑反对资产阶级自由化会妨碍改革开放，有的人抓反对资产阶级自由化怕被说成又搞政治运动了。邓小平同志认为，这种混乱状况确实给一些唯恐天下不乱的人的活动，提供了某些的有利条件，使搞资产阶级自由化的人更加有恃无恐地向四项基本原则进攻。因此，必须切实有效地加以纠正，理直气壮地同资产阶级自由化进行坚决的斗争。
    反对资产阶级自由化是一个长期的斗争
    从邓小平同志的许多论述中，我们可以看出，我国实行改革开放，在吸收和学习一些发达资本主义国家的科学技术和一切有用的东西的同时，资本主义社会的一些消极影响，也难免随之而入。因此，在我国阶级斗争还在一定范围内长期存在以及外来资产阶级思想不断发生影响的情况下，特别是在我国的经济发展在一个较长时期内仍落后于西方发达的资本主义国家，社会主义的优越性还没有充分地发挥出来的情况下，资产阶级自由化思想及其影响就会十分顽固地在政治思想领域内表现出来，作为一种社会思潮将会长期存在。因此，反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，就必然是一个长期的斗争。正像邓小平同志所指出的，只要改革开放就要反对资产阶级自由化。“这个斗争将贯穿在实现四化的整个过程中，不仅本世纪内要进行，下个世纪还要继续进行。”（《邓小平同志论坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化》，解放军出版社1989年6月第1版，第172页）事实证明，资产阶级自由化思潮的代表人物，绝不会放弃推翻共产党、在中国走资本主义道路的梦想。他们一遇到国内外的合适气候，还会兴风作浪。对此，全党全国和全军都必须有足够的思想准备。
    反对资产阶级自由化的手段要适应长期斗争的需要，应以教育为主。邓小平同志指出，“正因为斗争是长期的，所以我们不搞运动，主要是进行教育。既是斗争的过程，也是说服教育的过程。”（同上）他多次告诫人们要接受过去搞“左”的一套的教训，对于在资产阶级自由化思潮中犯错误的人，每个人的错误性质，程度如何，如何认识，如何处理，都要有所区别，恰如其分。批评的方法要讲究，分寸要适当，不搞围攻，不搞运动，但是批评的武器一定不能丢。在强调教育为主的同时，邓小平同志还认为，“如果有人搞得我们总是不安宁，也不能排除使用某种专政手段，使用纪律、法律手段。”　（同上书，第181页）“如果影响了社会秩序，触犯了刑律，就必须坚决处理。疏导，包括法律的处理。”（增订本第149页）不能在这种问题上让步。
    同资产阶级自由化进行长期斗争，就要长期教育青年、教育人民。邓小平同志在1987年初指出，这些年，“对青年学生引导不力，这是一个重大的失误。”　（增订本第154页）今年初，他又指出，十年来，我们最大的失误是在教育方面。这里讲的教育，最主要的就是对广大青年的思想政治教育。由于这种失误，一些青年学生在资产阶级自由化思想的影响和腐蚀下，对只有社会主义才能救中国，才能发展中国的真理不听不信，而对资本主义好的宣传讲什么信什么。顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的极少数人一搞煽动，他们就跟着闹事，甚至失去理智。这个严重的事实告诉我们，在坚持四项基本原则同搞资产阶级自由化的长期斗争中，争夺青年人是一个十分突出的方面。邓小平同志指出，学生闹事，“不能对他们只用拍拍肩膀的办法。要把是非讲清楚，要把利害讲清楚。是非是涉及我国根本利益的是非，利害是关系我国社会主义根本目标，即能不能达到我们本世纪目标和下个世纪目标的重大利害。这才是对青年的爱护，对青年的真诚引导。”
　（增订本第156页）否则，对青年学生只讲哄，只讲捧，一味地赞扬他们的“善良愿望”、“爱国行动”，只能助长他们盲目跟资产阶级自由化跑的思想与热情，这对青年学生实际上是一种坑害。
