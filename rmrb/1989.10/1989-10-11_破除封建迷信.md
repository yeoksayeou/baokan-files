Editor's Note:

Eliminating Feudal Superstitions

An important aspect of building socialist spiritual civilization is to change customs and eliminate feudal superstitions.

Superstition refers to beliefs in astrology, feng shui, fortune-telling, and ghosts and gods. Its functions are merely illusory beauties, opium for the soul, and a bloodless but deadly blade. For thousands of years, the Chinese people have suffered greatly from feudal superstitions. After liberation, the Party and the government have made tireless efforts to rescue the deceived masses from the abyss of superstition, achieving remarkable results. However, in recent years, feudal superstition activities have resurfaced in some places, causing social unrest and obstructing the progress of civilization. Therefore, firmly eliminating feudal superstitions is a necessity for society and the will of the people. To accomplish this task, we must first identify the reasons behind the resurgence of superstition activities in recent years and then address the root causes.

Superstition, in fact, reflects the specific psychological needs of those who believe in it. Human needs can be broadly categorized into material and spiritual. Material needs refer to the demand for material products; spiritual needs refer to the pursuit of personal value, morality, culture, and aspirations. People rely on faith and the spirit of struggle to meet their needs. In recent years, due to the relaxation of Marxism-Leninism and communist education, some people have experienced a "crisis of faith." This is reflected in those who believe in superstitions; they seek to fulfill their needs not by believing in human strength but by believing in the power of ghosts and gods; not by believing in materialism but by believing in fatalism; not by believing in struggle and perseverance but by relying on luck and chance. These people actually have a distorted faith. Therefore, we must vigorously promote a positive and uplifting worldview and communist ideology, making it the spiritual pillar of the people.

Feudal superstition activities, after thousands of years of evolution and development, have formed a stubborn traditional concept, some of which have become customs. Therefore, eliminating feudal superstitions requires long-term efforts, starting from children's education. Harmful customs must be reformed, and some must be eliminated. In short, we must reduce and ultimately eradicate the roots of feudal superstitions.

Superstition is also a manifestation of severe ignorance and lack of scientific knowledge, particularly evident in impoverished and illiterate regions. Therefore, we must adopt various forms to improve the scientific and cultural level of the entire population.

In the process of eliminating feudal superstitions, we must pay attention to cracking down on superstition-related crimes. Those who use superstition to defraud money, harm health, and incite feudal superstition activities, such as shamans, witches, fortune-tellers, and feng shui masters, play a particularly harmful role and must be banned and dealt with according to the law.

### 破除封建迷信

    破除封建迷信
    社会主义精神文明建设的一项重要内容，是移风易俗，破除封建迷信。
    迷信，是指人对星占、风水、命相、鬼神的相信。其功能，不过是虚幻的美景，毒化心灵的鸦片，杀人不见血的屠刀。千百年来，中国人深受封建迷信之害。解放后，党和政府为把受骗的群众从迷信的深渊中解救出来，做了不懈的努力，取得了显著的成效。但这几年，封建迷信活动在一些地方又闹腾起来，搞得人心混乱，社会不得安宁，成为阻碍社会文明进步的一股逆流。所以，坚决破除封建迷信，已为社会所需，人心所向。要做好这项工作，首先要找出这几年来迷信活动“兴盛不衰”的原因，然后对症下药进行治理。
    迷信，其实是反映了相信迷信人的某种特定的心理需要。人的需要不外乎是物质的和精神的。物质需要主要是指人对物质产品的需求；精神需要主要是指人对自身价值、道德、文化、抱负等的追求。人们要获得某种需要，靠的是信念的力量，奋斗的精神。近些年由于放松了马列主义、共产主义的教育，一些人头脑中出现了“信仰危机”。反映在信迷信人的身上，他们为了获取某种需要，不是相信人的力量，而是相信鬼神的力量；不是相信唯物论，而是相信宿命论；不是相信奋斗、拚搏，而是相信时运、侥幸。这些人，实际上是畸形的信仰。正因为这样，我们要大力宣传积极向上的人生观，宣传共产主义思想，使之成为人们的精神支柱。
    迷信活动经过千百年的演变发展，形成了一种顽固的传统观念，有的已成为风俗习惯。所以，破除封建迷信，要长期抓下去，要从儿童教育抓起。对那些有害的风俗习惯，要给以改造，有的则予以破除。总之，要缩小乃至铲除封建迷信的根基。
    迷信，又是人的一种严重缺乏科学知识的愚昧表现，尤其在贫困、文盲多的地区暴露得最为明显。因此，要采取多种形式，提高全民科学文化水平。
    在破除封建迷信中，要重视对迷信犯罪的打击。以迷信手段诈骗钱财、摧残人身健康的神汉、巫婆、算命先生、风水先生，在煽动封建迷信活动中，起着十分恶劣的作用，必须取缔，同时依法予以查处。
