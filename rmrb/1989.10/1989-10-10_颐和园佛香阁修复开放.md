The Hall of Dispelling Clouds in the Summer Palace has been restored and reopened to the public.

Beijing, October 9th — A reporter from our newspaper, Zhang Shuzheng, reports: Young women wearing red "escort to the hall" sashes warmly greet visitors ascending to the top of the Hall of Dispelling Clouds in the Summer Palace, politely expressing their welcome.

Constructed in the mid-18th century, the Hall of Dispelling Clouds in the Summer Palace consists of three levels, upper, middle, and lower, standing at a height of 41 meters. It is a masterpiece of viewing pavilions in Chinese architectural history. The hall was burned down by the Anglo-French Allied Forces in 1860. It was reconstructed between 1891 and 1894. By the early days of liberation, it was already in a state of decay. After emergency repairs in 1954, only the lower level was open to visitors. Last May, Beijing Municipality allocated 1.68 million yuan for another major renovation, which was completed at the end of September this year. On October 2nd, the Hall of Dispelling Clouds began receiving domestic and international visitors for viewing. This is the first time since its construction that the entire hall has been open to the public.

    颐和园佛香阁修复开放
    本报北京10月9日讯  记者张书政报道：肩披红色“登阁导游”绶带的小姐，笑容可掬地上前搀扶登上颐和园佛香阁楼顶的游人，彬彬有礼地表示欢迎。
    始建于18世纪中叶的颐和园佛香阁，共上、中、下三层，计41米高，是我国建筑史上登览式楼阁的杰作。该阁曾于1860年被英、法联军烧毁。1891至1894年重修，解放初已衰危。1954年抢险大修后，只对游人开放下层。去年5月，北京市拨款168万元，再次大修，今年9月底修复竣工。10月2日，佛香阁开始接待中外游人登览。这是自建阁以来首次全阁通高开放。
