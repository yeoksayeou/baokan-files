People's Daily, United Nations, October 20th - Correspondent Liú Kāichéng reports: China's Ambassador for Disarmament, Hóu Zhìtōng, spoke at the 44th UN General Assembly First Committee meeting today. He welcomed the progress made in the international disarmament field over the past year and hoped that the arms reduction talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, as well as between the two major military blocs, would reach an agreement beneficial to peace and security, without harming the interests of other countries.

Hóu Zhìtōng stated that the Chinese government is fully aware of the dangers of nuclear war and has always advocated for a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, thereby fundamentally eliminating the threat of nuclear war.

He pointed out that the key to achieving this goal lies in the superpowers, which possess the world's largest and most advanced nuclear arsenals, taking the lead in stopping the testing, production, and deployment of all types of nuclear weapons, and significantly reducing and destroying various types of nuclear weapons deployed both domestically and abroad. Subsequently, an international conference with the participation of all nuclear states and broad representation can be convened to discuss the steps and measures for the thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

Hóu Zhìtōng clearly declared that China has never encouraged, engaged in, or assisted other countries in the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Hóu Zhìtōng emphasized that conventional arms reduction should first focus on European countries and member states of the two major military blocs, with particular emphasis on the leading countries of the two blocs.

Hóu Zhìtōng also reiterated China's stance on advocating for a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of chemical weapons, biological weapons, and space-based weapons.

　　我代表在联大一委会议上发言
　　美苏裁军谈判应早日达成协议
    本报联合国10月20日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国裁军大使侯志通今天在第44届联大第一委员会会议上发言，对过去一年来国际裁军领域的进展表示欢迎，希望美苏以及两大军事集团间的裁军谈判，早日达成有益于和平与安全，而不损害别国利益的协议。
    侯志通表示，中国政府充分意识到核战争的危险性，并一贯主张全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，从而从根本上消除核战争的威胁。
    他指出，达到这一目标的关键在于：拥有世界上最庞大、最先进核武库的超级大国率先停止试验、生产和部署一切类型的核武器，并大幅度裁减和销毁各自部署在其国内外的各种类型的核武器，此后，可召开有所有核国家参加的、具有广泛代表性的国际会议，商议彻底销毁核武器步骤和措施。
    侯志通明确宣布，中国历来不鼓励、不从事核武器的扩散，也不帮助其它国家发展核武器。
    侯志通强调，常规裁军应首先着眼于欧洲地区和两大军事集团的成员国，并突出两大集团为首的大国。
    侯志通还重申了中国主张全面禁止和彻底销毁化学武器、生物武器和外空武器的立场。
