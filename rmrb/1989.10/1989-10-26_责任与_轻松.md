I have never done anything that would let anyone down.
I have never planned to do anything that would let anyone down.
I have always wanted to be a responsible person, taking responsibility for every word I say, every action I take, and every thing I do. Even with children, I never break my promises, fearing that they might be left with a shadow in their hearts from being let down over something small.

A friend once asked, "Doesn't it get tiring? Can't you just let go of your sense of responsibility and live a little easier?"

When you never let anyone down, never let society down, and never regret or feel guilty about anything, how can you not feel a sense of ease in your heart?

People say that the strong are those who have seen through the mysteries of life, "Better to let down the world than to be let down by the world."

Only the weak are those who never let anyone down, carrying the heavy burden of responsibility, like a snail carrying its shell.

A friend tried to enlighten me, saying, "If you let others down, you are standing on a higher level, judging them, and abandoning them. Spiritually, you are the victor. If you don't let others down, they will eventually let you down, and you deserve to be hurt."

I admire and respect those who aim to let down the world, but I can't do it myself. Whenever I think of letting someone down, I try to imagine the heartbreak and pain of the person being let down, and I feel even more determined to let the world let me down rather than letting down even one person, allowing myself to be hurt so that others can feel ashamed and reflect.

In the past, I read a short story about an old carpenter who always polished the inside of the wooden boxes with his calloused hands, never cutting corners. His apprentice laughed at him, "No one will see it, why bother?" The master said, "I know it myself."

Yes, even without anyone watching, every task must be done seriously, because "I know it myself."

That person didn't pay the bill and walked away without looking back, but think about it, he didn't let me down, he let himself down.

I always make sure to take a blind person several extra streets to find their way, not letting society down;
I double-check the monthly report, not letting my work down;
I treat any friend's troubles as my own, helping to think of solutions, not letting down the trust placed in me;
Even in a heavy downpour, I still go to the appointment with an umbrella that has been blown over, not letting down my promise;
Even after being severely hurt, I still love life and live strongly, not letting down those who have cared for me;
I write down the best life experiences and feelings, not letting down the readers who trust me.

In the morning, I get up early to run. The sun rises slowly in front of me, and the fresh wind blows against my face.

Looking back, nature has given me clean air and a pleasant scenery, a healthy body and mind to provide me with abundant work energy and life enthusiasm. From beginning to end, no one has let me down.

Looking back, the once muddy path I walked is now lined with beautiful, pure flowers on both sides.

### 责任与“轻松”

　　责任与“轻松”
　　陈漫雪
    从没有做过任何有负于人的事。
    从没有打算做任何有负于人的事。
    一向想做一个负责任的人，对自己的每一句话，每一个举动，每一件事负责任。即使对小孩子也决不食言，怕他会因了一件小小的“被负”而心灵留下阴影。
    有朋友问：“不累吗？难道不可以抛却责任感，活得更轻松一点？”
    当你，当你从不负于任何人，从不负于社会，从不对任何一件事追悔、愧疚，心里怎不油然升起一种“轻松”感。
    人说强者是参透了人生的禅机，“宁负天下人，不让天下人负我”。
    只有弱者才是不负人的窝囊废，背着沉重的责任感，活像背着自己的房子爬行的蜗牛。
    有朋友开导说：“你负别人，是你站在一个更高的层次审度他，舍弃他，在精神上你是战胜者。你不负人，别人迟早会负你，活该你受伤害。”
    心里也好欣赏好佩服立志负尽天下人的强者作派，可是自己却做不来。一想到负人便试着去体会被负者沮丧受创的伤心滋味，便会变本加利地生出宁肯被天下人负，也不要负任何一个人，让自己受伤让别人去惭愧去反省的“舍身饲虎”壮义。
    从前，读过一则短文，说有一个老木匠，总是用带着老茧的手掌把木箱里边也打磨得光光溜溜，从不偷工，徒弟讪笑他：“又没有别人知道，何必这么傻费力。”师傅说：“我自己心里知道。”
    是的，即使没有任何人在身边监督，也必须认认真真对待每一件事，因为“我自己心里知道”。
    那人没有付清帐单就头也不回地走了，可是想想看，他不是负我，他是负自己。
    总能自觉地做到路遇盲人问路，就多绕两条街搀他去找，不负于社会；
    把那份月报表再认真地核对一遍，不负于工作；
    把任何一个朋友的烦恼当作自己的烦恼去思考，帮助出主意解决，不负于朋友的托付；
    暴雨铺天也一样打一顶被掀翻的伞去赴约，不负于自己的诺言；
    即使受到重创也仍热爱生命，顽强地活，不负于那些曾给过我关怀的人；
    把最好的生活经验，生活感受写出来，不负于信任我的读者。
    清晨，起大早去跑步。太阳在前方冉冉升起，清新的风迎面拂来。
    回头想想，大自然赋予了我洁净的空气和宜人的景色，健康的身心供给我旺盛的工作精力和生活热情。自始至终没有任何人负我。
    回头看看，走过的那条曾经泥泞的小路，两旁开满了心无尘埃的美丽的小花。
