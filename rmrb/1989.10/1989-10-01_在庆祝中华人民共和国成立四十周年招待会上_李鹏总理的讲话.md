At the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Premier Li Peng delivered a speech:

Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades!

On this joyous occasion of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, extend warm greetings and best wishes to all the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and patriotic people of all nationalities across the country who are engaged in the construction of socialist modernization. I also extend warm greetings and best wishes to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security personnel. I extend warm greetings and best wishes to our compatriots in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, as well as to overseas Chinese. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the international friends who have shown concern and support for China's modernization drive. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to the distinguished guests and diplomatic envoys present here today!

On October 1, 1949, the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China. From that day forward, China ended its history of thousands of years of exploitation and its century-long history of being enslaved by imperialism and colonialism. China entered a new era of development. Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, through the joint efforts of all nationalities, our country has undergone tremendous changes. We have established and consolidated a socialist state under the leadership of the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and practicing people's democratic dictatorship. We have achieved and consolidated national unity except for Taiwan and other islands. We have defeated the aggression, sabotage, and provocation of imperialism, safeguarded the independence and security of our great motherland, and established and developed a socialist political and economic system. Relying mainly on our own strength, we have carried out large-scale economic construction, gradually established an independent and relatively complete industrial and national economic system, and significantly enhanced our national economic strength. On just 7% of the world's arable land, we have basically solved the problem of feeding 22% of the world's population. Domestic and foreign trade is thriving, cultural and educational undertakings are developing, scientific and technological levels are significantly improving, national defense capabilities are greatly enhanced, and people's lives are continuously improving. China pursues an independent foreign policy, adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has established diplomatic relations with 139 countries. We have economic and trade exchanges with 184 countries and regions. China is playing an increasingly important role in maintaining world peace and promoting world stability and development.

Of course, our socialist cause has had its twists and turns, and the Party and the government have made mistakes and had setbacks in their guiding principles. However, overall, the past 40 years have seen development and progress in China's economy, politics, and social life, especially in the 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. We have adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles and the policy of reform and opening up, achieving remarkable results that have attracted worldwide attention. Forty years of practice have shown us that only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China. Persisting in the socialist path is the only way forward for China.

The year 1989 is an extraordinary year in the history of our republic. In the struggle to quell the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in the spring and summer, our Party and state underwent a severe test and achieved a great victory, safeguarding the achievements of 40 years of socialist construction and 10 years of reform and opening up. Although Comrade Zhao Ziyang made serious errors in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party, we relied on the collective strength of the Party and the support of the people to ultimately achieve victory in the struggle. This year, we have continued to seriously implement the policies of rectification and deepening reform, achieving significant results. The national economy has developed relatively steadily, avoiding a major downturn, and the overly high industrial growth rate has gradually slowed down. The total grain output may exceed last year's level, and the upward trend in prices has been controlled. We must continue to work hard and strive together to ensure that the economic situation continues to improve this year.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades! After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, some friendly people abroad have had doubts about China's current policies, and some comrades at home have had various concerns. Here, I would like to emphasize several issues that everyone is concerned about.

Firmly adhering to the Party's basic line and policies is the fundamental starting point for all our work.

China is a socialist country with a population of 1.1 billion, with underdeveloped productive forces, a large gap with developed countries in terms of economy, and people's lives are not yet prosperous. History has determined that this generation and the next few generations of Chinese people must work hard and concentrate their efforts on modernizing the country. The basic line formulated by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party, which focuses on economic construction, adheres to the Four Cardinal Principles, and adheres to reform and opening up, is the foundation of our country and the path to strength. We will firmly implement this and will not waver.

Now, some people at home and abroad are concerned about whether some specific policies of reform and opening up will change. Here, we are responsible for telling everyone that the current contract responsibility system for enterprises, the manager responsibility system, the development policies for coastal areas, and the policies for individual and private economies will all maintain stability and continuity and will not be easily changed. The contract responsibility system for enterprises is conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the majority of enterprises and workers to develop production and should be continued, but we should summarize experience, eliminate evils, and continuously improve it. The manager responsibility system should continue to be implemented, but attention should be paid to the political core role of the party organization within the enterprise and to strengthening political and ideological work. We should continue to advocate and encourage the development of an outward-looking economy in coastal areas, continuously improve the investment environment, and welcome foreign investors to establish various foreign-funded enterprises in China, but at the same time, we should pay attention to adapting to the macro requirements of the national economy and the rationality of the industrial structure. In the primary stage of socialism, individual and private economies are supplements to the public ownership economy and should be allowed to exist and develop, but they should be legally supervised and managed to ensure their healthy development.

Continuing to implement the rectification and deepening reform is the current focus of construction and reform.

The implementation of rectification and deepening reform is not contradictory to reform and opening up but is to create more favorable conditions for reform and opening up. The purpose of rectification is to alleviate the contradiction between total demand and total supply in society, gradually eliminate inflation, and make the economy develop in a stable and coordinated manner. The current difficulties facing the economy are the result of the overheating of the economy in the previous few years and the accumulation of excessive distribution of national income. Therefore, rectification needs a process, probably 3 years or a little longer. We hope that through rectification, we can control the overheating of the economy, maintain a reasonable speed, reduce inflation to below double digits, gradually reduce the fiscal deficit, and establish a macro-control system for the economy. The state should appropriately concentrate financial and material resources to strengthen the construction of basic industries and infrastructure, enhance the momentum of economic development, strengthen national defense construction, and enhance national security defense capabilities.

Currently, many enterprises are facing difficulties, and the production of long-term products has decreased, and products are not selling well, which is a necessary result of rectification. But this also creates conditions for the adjustment of the national economy and enterprises, which must be fully utilized. For those large and medium-sized key enterprises related to the national economy and people's livelihood, the state should provide support in terms of funds, energy, and raw materials, and the enterprises themselves should also work hard to improve management, carry out technological transformation, and continuously improve the economic benefits of the enterprises.

Controlling the rise in prices is an important task of rectification, and although some achievements have been made, we must not relax our efforts. From the State Council to local governments at all levels, we must take more decisive measures, overcome various difficulties, and do a good job in price control. In the future, the focus of price control should be on the prices of basic living materials for the people to ensure the stability of the lives of the majority of people.

Starting next year, our country will gradually enter the peak period of repayment of domestic and foreign debts, which will bring new difficulties to the economy and increase the arduousness of rectification. Leading cadres at all levels must be mentally prepared, work hard, set an example, and work together with the people of the whole country to tighten our belts for a few years.

We must strengthen the basic position of agriculture and strive for a good harvest.

Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and also the weak link in the national economy. Developing agriculture relies on policy, science and technology, and investment. The household contract responsibility system is a major policy related to the stability of 800 million farmers in rural areas and is in line with the current level of productive forces in rural areas and should be continued and improved. In places where conditions are truly met, it is possible to develop appropriate scale operations and collective economies, develop socialized production service organizations, and promote the development of the rural economy.

This year's agricultural harvest will be better than last year, but many areas have been affected by natural disasters. To ensure a good harvest of autumn crops, we must do a good job in late-stage field management and autumn harvest. We must seize the opportunity to do a good job in winter sowing and mobilize the masses to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction to create favorable conditions for a bumper harvest next year. We must do everything possible to tap the potential of funds and do a good job in the procurement of grain, cotton, and other agricultural products.

Maintaining and consolidating a stable social and political environment is an important guarantee for the smooth progress of economic construction.

In the primary stage of socialism in our country, class struggle is no longer the main contradiction, but it will exist within a certain range for a long time and may sometimes be quite intense. This is evidenced by the occurrence and development of the turmoil and riot. We must remain sober-minded. To protect the interests of the vast majority of the people, to ensure national security and social order, we must strengthen people's democratic dictatorship. In the current cleanup work, we must strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two types of different contradictions. For the few criminals, we must handle them according to law; for the problems within the people, we should mainly summarize experience, raise awareness, and unite the majority to the greatest extent.

Through this turmoil, there are also many things for our Party and government to reflect on. The corruption within the Party, government, and society, as well as the unfair distribution of society and inflation, are important reasons for the dissatisfaction of the broad masses. We must also remain sober-minded and sincerely accept the criticism and supervision of the masses. Recently, the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council have taken a series of measures to combat corruption and strengthen clean governance, which have achieved initial results and been supported by the people. These measures must be implemented to the end and must not be abandoned halfway.

China's political system reform must be combined with economic system reform and gradually promoted, while strengthening democratic construction, we must also strengthen legal construction. The fundamental purpose of our government is to serve the people, and governments at all levels must accept the supervision of the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the democratic parties, and the broad masses of the people. We must strengthen social security work, resolutely crack down on all criminal activities that disrupt social order, and create a stable working and living environment for the people.

We must carry out the education against bourgeois liberalization to the end and will not stop halfway.

To better adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, we must continuously carry out education on the basic national conditions and the basic line for the broad masses of the people, to raise the spirit of patriotism, collectivism, self-reliance, and hard work among the broad masses of the people, and to enhance their firmness and awareness in supporting the socialist system. Youth is our future and hope, and we must wholeheartedly care for and love the healthy growth of young people. Schools must adhere to the policy of all-round development of morality, intelligence, and physique, put the establishment of a firm and correct political direction in the first place, and strive to cultivate socialist new people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

We reiterate here that the Party's policy towards intellectuals will not change because of this turmoil. Intellectuals are part of the working class and are an important force in building socialism. The Party and the government will continue to improve the working and living conditions of intellectuals, strive to make full use of their talents, and give full play to the active role of intellectuals.

Adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy.

The current international situation is shifting from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue, and the world is undergoing changes favorable to peace and development. Our view on the general trend of the international situation has not changed, and it is still possible to create a relatively long period of international peace for China's modernization drive. China will continue to implement an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, continue to work to develop relations with all countries in the world; stand firmly with the Third World countries, support their just causes; oppose all forms of hegemony, maintain world and regional peace, and develop friendship with the people of all countries in the world.

We will continue to implement the policy of opening up to the outside world, actively introduce advanced science and technology and management experience from abroad, absorb foreign investment and appropriately use foreign funds to accelerate the construction of our country. Our reform and opening up are carried out on the premise of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, for the development and perfection of the socialist system. We will not allow international hostile forces to take this opportunity to infiltrate and subvert our socialist system. The economic sanctions imposed by some Western countries on China will cause temporary difficulties for China, but they will also further stimulate the Chinese people's spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and the sanctions themselves will also be harmed. More and more enlightened people in the West have realized that sanctions are unwise. China has always advocated developing trade and economic and technological cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which is not only for the interests of China but also for the promotion of world peace and development.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades!

Peaceful reunification and the principle of "one country, two systems" represent the common aspirations of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. No matter what storms occur at home and abroad, we will unswervingly adhere to this policy. We will not change the capitalist system in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, and at the same time, we will not allow anyone to use Hong Kong as a base to subvert the central government and the socialist system on the mainland. From the Chinese side, we will faithfully implement the joint declaration reached by the governments of China and Britain on the settlement of the Hong Kong issue and will do our utmost to ensure the prosperity, stability, and smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong. We are pleased to see that China and Portugal have carried out effective cooperation in implementing the joint declaration on the settlement of the Macau issue, and we hope that this momentum can be maintained and developed. We hope that the authorities in Taiwan will put the overall interests of the Chinese nation first and do more practical things to promote the "three links" and other exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, and not do things that will strain cross-strait relations and are not conducive to national reunification. China's severance of diplomatic relations with Grenada shows our solemn position on maintaining one China. The so-called "flexible diplomacy" pursued by the authorities in Taiwan is essentially continuing to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," which goes against the wishes of all Chinese people and will not receive the support of overseas Chinese and the international community, and will have no future. We are convinced that the cohesion of the Chinese nation is indestructible, and through the long-term struggle of patriotic compatriots at home and abroad, the great cause of national reunification will surely achieve final victory!

Finally, I propose a toast:

To the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
To the vigorous development of China's socialist modernization,
To the reunification of our motherland and the unity of all nationalities in China,
To world peace, stability, progress, and development,
To the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of the world,

Cheers!

    在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年招待会上
    李鹏总理的讲话
    各位来宾，各位同志！
    在举国欢庆中华人民共和国成立四十周年的时候，我代表中共中央和国务院，向战斗在社会主义现代化建设各条战线上的全国各族工人、农民、知识分子和一切爱国人士，向人民解放军、武警部队指战员和人民警察，向港澳同胞、台湾同胞和海外侨胞，致以节日的祝贺和亲切的问候！向在座的各国来宾和驻华使节表示热烈的欢迎！向关心和支持我国现代化建设的国际友人表示衷心的感谢！
    1949年10月1日，伟大领袖毛泽东同志宣告了中华人民共和国成立。从此，结束了我国几千年来剥削制度的历史，结束了100多年来殖民主义、帝国主义奴役中国人民的历史，中国进入了历史发展的新时期。40年来，在中国共产党领导下，经过各族人民的共同努力，我国发生了翻天覆地的变化。我们建立和巩固了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、人民民主专政的社会主义国家，实现和巩固了除台湾等岛屿以外的国家统一，战胜了帝国主义的侵略、破坏和挑衅，维护了伟大祖国的独立和安全，建立和发展了社会主义的政治和经济制度。我们主要依靠自己的力量，大规模地进行经济建设，逐步建立了独立的、比较完整的工业体系和国民经济体系，国家经济实力有了很大的增强。我们在仅占世界7％的耕地上，基本上解决了占世界22％人口的温饱问题。国内外贸易繁荣兴旺，文化教育事业不断发展，科学技术水平显著提高，国防力量大为增强，人民生活日益改善。中国奉行独立自主的外交政策，坚持和平共处五项原则，同139个国家建立了外交关系，同184个国家和地区有了经济贸易往来。我国为维护世界和平，促进世界的稳定和发展，在国际上发挥着越来越重要的作用。
    当然，我国的社会主义事业有过曲折和反复，党和政府在指导方针上犯过错误，有过失误。但是总起来看，40年来，在中国经济、政治、社会生活中居主导地位的是发展和进步，尤其是十一届三中全会以来的10年，我们坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，成绩卓著，举世瞩目。40年的实践告诉我们，只有社会主义能够救中国，只有社会主义能够发展中国。坚持走社会主义道路，这是中国的唯一出路。
    1989年是我们共和国历史上不平凡的一年。在春夏之交制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，我们党和国家经受了一场严峻的考验，取得了伟大的胜利，保卫了40年来社会主义建设和十年来改革开放的成果。尽管赵紫阳同志犯了支持动乱和分裂党的严重错误，但我们依靠党的集体力量，依靠人民的支持，终于取得了斗争的胜利。今年以来，我们还继续认真贯彻执行了治理整顿和深化改革的方针，取得了明显的成效。国民经济发展比较平稳，避免了大的滑坡，过高的工业发展速度逐步降了下来，粮食总产量可能超过去年的水平，物价上涨势头得到控制。我们要再接再厉，共同努力，使今年的经济形势继续向好的方向发展。
    各位来宾，各位同志！首都平息反革命暴乱以后，国际上一些友好人士对中国的现行方针政策产生了某些疑虑，国内一些同志也有这样那样的担心。这里，我着重谈谈大家共同关心的几个问题。
    坚定不移地执行党的基本路线和方针政策，是我们各项工作的根本立足点
    中国是一个有11亿人口的社会主义大国，生产力不发达，同发达国家的经济差距很大，人民生活还不富裕。历史决定了我们这一代和下几代中国人，必须艰苦奋斗，集中力量进行现代化建设。党的十三大制定的以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的基本路线，是我国的立国之本，强国之路。对此我们将坚决执行，决不动摇。
    现在有些国内外人士担心，改革开放的一些具体政策是否会发生变化。在这里，我们负责地告诉大家，现行的企业承包制，厂长负责制，沿海地区发展政策，个体经济和私营经济政策等，都要保持稳定性和连续性，绝不会轻易地加以改变。企业承包经营责任制，有利于调动广大企业和职工发展生产的积极性，应当继续坚持，但要总结经验，兴利除弊，不断加以完善。厂长负责制要继续贯彻执行，但要注意发挥企业党组织的政治核心作用和加强政治思想工作。要继续提倡和鼓励沿海地区发展外向型经济，不断努力改善投资环境，欢迎外商到中国来兴办各种外资企业，但同时要注意适应国民经济发展的宏观要求和产业结构的合理性。在社会主义初级阶段，个体经济和私营经济是公有制经济的补充，应当允许它们存在和发展，但要依法加强监督和管理，保证它们的健康发展。
    继续贯彻治理整顿的方针，是当前建设和改革的重点
    实行治理整顿与改革开放并不对立，而是为改革开放创造更加有利的条件。治理整顿的目的是缓解社会总需求超过总供给的矛盾，逐步消除通货膨胀，使经济得到稳定协调地发展。当前我国经济面临的困难，是前几年经济过热，国民收入连续超分配积累下来的恶果。因此，治理整顿需要有一个过程，大概需要3年或者更长一点的时间。我们希望通过治理整顿，把经济过热现象控制住，保持一个合理的速度，通货膨胀降低到两位数以下，逐步减少财政赤字，建立对经济的宏观调控体系。国家要适当集中财力物力，以加强基础产业和基础设施的建设，增强经济发展后劲，加强国防建设，增强国家安全防御能力。
    目前许多企业发生了困难，长线产品生产下降，产品滞销，这是治理整顿的必然的结果。但这也为国家经济和企业的结构调整创造了条件，必须不失时机地加以充分利用。对那些关系国计民生的大中型骨干企业，国家要在资金、能源和原材料上给予支持，企业自己也要努力改进管理，进行技术改造，不断提高企业的经济效益。
    控制物价上涨是治理整顿的一项重要任务，目前虽然取得了一定的成绩，但丝毫不能松懈。从国务院到各级政府，都要采取更为果断的措施，克服各种困难，把物价工作做好。今后要把控制物价的重点放在人民基本生活资料的价格上，以保障大多数人的生活稳定。　　
    从明年起，我国将逐步进入内外债偿还高峰，这会给经济带来新的困难，增加治理整顿的艰巨性。各级领导干部，要有足够的思想准备，艰苦奋斗，以身作则，同全国人民一道过几年紧日子。
    切实加强农业的基础地位，争取农业有一个较好的收成
    农业是国民经济的基础，又是国民经济的薄弱环节。发展农业，一靠政策，二靠科技，三靠投入。联产承包责任制是关系到稳定中国八亿农民的大政策，符合农村现阶段生产力的发展水平，应当继续实行并不断完善。在确实具备条件的地方，可以发展适度规模经营和集体经济，发展社会化生产服务组织，促进农村经济的发展。
    今年的农业收成将好于去年，但不少地区遇到了自然灾害。为争取秋粮有个好收成，要切实做好后期田间管理和秋收工作。要不失时机地搞好冬播，发动群众开展大规模的农田水利基本建设，为夺取明年农业丰收创造有利条件。要千方百计挖掘资金潜力，努力做好粮棉等农产品的收购工作。
    维护和巩固稳定的社会政治环境，是顺利进行经济建设的重要保证
    在我国的社会主义初级阶段，阶级斗争已经不是主要矛盾，但将在一定范围内长期存在，有时还会表现得很激烈，这次动乱和暴乱的发生和发展就说明了这一点，我们务必保持清醒的头脑。为了保护绝大多数人民的利益，保证国家的安全和社会秩序的稳定，必须加强人民民主专政。在当前的清理工作中，要严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾。对极少数犯罪分子，要依法进行处理；对人民内部的问题，主要是总结经验，提高认识，最大限度地团结大多数人。
    通过这次动乱，也有许多值得我们党和政府反思的地方。党、政府和社会上出现的腐败现象，社会分配不公以及通货膨胀，是引发广大群众不满的重要原因。对此，我们也必须保持清醒的头脑，诚恳地接受群众的批评和监督。最近，党中央、国务院采取了一系列克服腐败加强廉政建设的措施，收到了初步效果，得到了人民的拥护。对这些措施要一抓到底，决不能半途而废。
    中国的政治体制改革还要与经济体制改革相结合，逐步推进，在加强民主建设的同时加强法制建设。我们的政府的根本宗旨是为人民服务，各级政府要接受人大、政协、各民主党派和广大人民群众的监督。要大力加强社会治安工作，坚决打击一切破坏社会治安的犯罪活动，使人民有一个安定的工作环境和生活环境。
    把反对资产阶级自由化的教育进行到底，绝不半途而废
    为了更好地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，我们要向广大人民群众不断地开展基本国情的教育，开展基本路线的教育，以提高广大人民爱国主义、集体主义、自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，提高拥护社会主义制度的坚定性和自觉性。青年是我们的未来和希望，要满腔热情地关心和爱护青年的健康成长。学校要坚持德、智、体全面发展的教育方针，把树立坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位，努力培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义新人。
    我们在这里再次重申，党的知识分子政策不会因为这次动乱而有所改变。知识分子是工人阶级的一部分，是建设社会主义的重要力量。党和政府要继续改善知识分子的工作条件和生活条件，努力做到人尽其才，才尽其用，充分发挥知识分子的积极作用。
    坚持独立自主的和平外交政策
    当前的国际形势，正由紧张转向缓和，由对抗转向对话，世界正在发生着有利于和平与发展的变化。我们对国际形势总趋势的看法没有改变，为我国现代化建设争取到一个较长时期的国际和平环境仍然是可能的。中国将一如既往地执行独立自主的和平外交政策，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，继续努力发展同世界各国的关系；始终不渝地站在第三世界国家一边，支持它们的正义事业；反对各种形式的霸权主义，维护世界和地区的和平，发展同世界各国人民的友谊。
    我们将继续执行对外开放政策，积极引进国外的先进科学技术和管理经验，吸收外商投资和适当利用国外资金，加快我国的建设。我们的改革开放是在坚持四项基本原则前提下的改革开放，是为了社会主义制度的发展和完善。决不容许国际敌对势力乘此机会，对我国社会主义制度进行渗透与颠覆。西方有些国家对中国实行的经济制裁，会给中国造成暂时的困难，但也会更加激发中国人民奋发图强、自力更生的精神，而制裁者本身也会受到损害。西方越来越多的有识之士已经认识到，制裁是不明智的。中国历来主张，在平等互利的基础上发展同各国的贸易往来和经济技术合作，这不仅是为了中国的利益，而且也是为了促进世界的和平与发展。
    各位来宾，各位同志！
    和平统一和一国两制，代表了包括港澳同胞和台湾同胞在内的全体中国人民的共同心愿，不管国内外发生什么风波，我们都将坚定不移地执行这一方针。我们不会改变港澳地区的资本主义制度，同时也不允许有人利用香港作为颠覆中央政府和大陆社会主义制度的基地。从中国方面来说，我们将切实遵守中英两国政府业已达成的关于解决香港问题的联合声明，愿为香港繁荣稳定和政权的顺利交接而竭尽努力。我们满意地看到中葡两国在执行关于解决澳门问题的联合声明中进行了卓有成效的合作，希望这一势头能得到保持和发展。我们希望台湾当局以中华民族利益的大局为重，多做一些有利于促进海峡两岸“三通”和其他交往的实事，不要做那些导致两岸关系紧张、不利于祖国统一的事。中国中止同格林纳达的外交关系，表明了维护一个中国的庄严立场。台湾当局推行所谓“弹性外交”，实质上是在继续制造“两个中国”或者“一中一台”，违背了全体中国人民的心愿，得不到海外爱国侨胞和国际社会的支持，是决不会有什么前途的。我们深信，中华民族的凝聚力是牢不可破的，经过海内外爱国同胞的共同长期奋斗，祖国的统一大业，必将取得最后的胜利！
    最后，我提议：
    为庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年，
    为我国社会主义现代化建设的蓬勃发展，
    为我们祖国的统一和全国各族人民的团结，
    为世界的和平、稳定、进步和发展，
    为中国人民和世界人民的友谊与合作，
    干杯！　　　（新华社发）（附图片）
