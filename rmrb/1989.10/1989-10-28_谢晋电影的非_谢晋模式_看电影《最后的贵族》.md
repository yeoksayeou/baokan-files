The ever-confusing phenomenon of cinema seems to be getting even more confusing: while some filmmakers who favor "cinematic aesthetics" are floating in the commercial tide, attempting to align with the so-called "Xie Jin mode" and use intricate plotlines to pursue "sensational effects," Xie Jin, whose works have always had the most "sensational effects," has inexplicably released a film with a subdued plot and a vague theme, *The Last Aristocrats*, which is not in the "Xie Jin mode." Is history playing a joke?

This film, adapted from a novel by Taiwanese writer Bai Xianyong, does not completely break away from Xie Jin's past works. Not only does the content still focus on the fate of individuals in turbulent times, but even the seemingly distant portrayal methods, such as the meticulously crafted and finely made scenes of the bar night and the soul-shattering Venice, still retain the traditional artistic charm of Xie Jin's style rather than the popular "modern" cinematic aesthetics. An artist with a unique pursuit of reality and artistic creation will not be swayed by trends to the point of lacking distinctive features in their works, nor will they ignore the development of reality to the point of stagnation in their works.

The film depicts the fate of a few aristocratic ladies who have ended up in a foreign land; their plight seems far removed from our reality, as if it has nothing to do with us. However, the spiritual state of these ladies on the other side of the ocean is close to our souls. These young women, who were once carefree and full of ambition and ideals, have fallen into a spiritual predicament due to historical changes. Li Teng wanders through the vast dust, seemingly having struggled and fought, but the result is a physical dissipation that reveals an even greater spiritual emptiness. "Looking back, a hundred years have passed," the world is too vast to accommodate her soul. Every house and every stream in her birthplace, Venice, seems to give her a sense of returning "home." But the blood flowing through her veins is that of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor. She asks an old Russian aristocrat who once wandered in Shanghai, "Are the waters of the world connected?" This naturally reveals her longing for the homeland by the Huangpu River. But the homeland is only a dream for her, and her soul still has no place to rest. Therefore, she returns "home" in the canals of Venice, leaving behind endless sorrow.

People create history, and history also creates, distorts, and plays tricks on people. The tortuous and turbulent process of historical development always has the elevation of souls, as well as the loss of souls. The tragic fate of these overseas descendants of the Yellow Emperor will not be without resonance in the hearts of those who are also descendants of the Yellow Emperor and have experienced the vicissitudes of history.

This film lacks the usual thickness and the era's spirit and political passion that penetrate the screen in Xie Jin's films, as well as the direct portrayal of the social environment that tightly follows the characters' actions. It is only the most ordinary and common fragments of life that present the changes in characters' personalities and emotions. But the characters' spiritual struggles condense social contradictions, and the vicissitudes of history are integrated into the characters' fates. The film does not simply praise or condemn anything, nor does it answer anything, nor does it cater to or comfort anything; it simply presents everything as calmly as possible. This will not cause a "sensational effect" because it does not provide solace for the soul, making people lose the psychological balance they are used to from Xie Jin's films or from feeling reality through Xie Jin's films; but it can make people face life directly. This will make people feel vague because the film presents things that are not simple, and the creator cannot make judgments that are clear but may restrict people's imagination; but it can also make people understand and think more broadly and deeply about the essence of life.

Perhaps, the life material of "The Last Aristocrats" is still somewhat unfamiliar to the film's creators, or due to other subjective or objective difficulties that are temporarily hard to overcome, the artistic expression is slightly constrained and not entirely natural, and the ups and downs of the main characters are not without abruptness. However, the artist's real-life experiences permeate the entire film.

Compared to Xie Jin's past films, *The Last Aristocrats* appears cold and more profound. The change in Xie Jin's films, which have always been in a stable state, is naturally a manifestation of the artist's deep experience of reality and a unique pursuit of artistic creation; but at the same time, is this not also a choice given to the artist by history?

### 谢晋电影的非“谢晋模式”——看电影《最后的贵族》

　　谢晋电影的非“谢晋模式”
　　——看电影《最后的贵族》
　　余倩
    本来就让人困惑的电影现象，似乎越来越让人困惑：在一些偏爱“影像美学”的电影创作者沉浮于商业大潮，转而试图靠拢所谓“谢晋模式”，想用曲折的故事情节去追求“轰动效应”的时候，一向作品最有“轰动效应”的谢晋，却鬼使神差似地，推出一部情节淡化、主题朦胧的非“谢晋模式”的《最后的贵族》。这是历史在开玩笑么？
    这部根据台湾作家白先勇小说改编的影片，并未和谢晋过去的作品彻底决裂。不说内容依旧是对动荡年代人物命运的关注，即从似乎距离原有表现方式较远的，那个酒吧之夜和魂断威尼斯等细节考究、制作精致的场面看，也都不同于流行的“现代”的“影像美学”，而仍有蕴涵了民族传统艺术气韵的谢晋式的意趣。一个有自己对现实人生和艺术创作独特追求的艺术家，总不会随波逐流而让作品没有自己比较稳定的特征，也不会无视现实的发展而让作品凝固不化。
    这部影片表现的，看来不过是几位流落异国他乡的最后的贵族小姐的命运；她们的困顿处境，和我们现实的距离还远得很，好象没有什么痛痒相关。但在大洋彼岸的这些小姐的精神状态，却又迫近了我们的灵魂。这些原来无忧无虑，又都很有抱负、很有理想的豪门贵胄的年青女性，由于历史的变革陷入精神的困境。李彤潜入茫茫尘海，似乎也曾搏击过、挣扎过，结果却是形骸的放浪透露出精神的更加空虚。“再回头已百年身”，世界之大再也无法安顿她的灵魂。她的出生地威尼斯的每一栋房屋和每一条水流，似乎都让她有一种回“家”的感觉。可是在她身上流贯的还是炎黄子孙的血。她问那位曾经流落上海的俄罗斯贵族老人：“世界上的水也是相通的吗？”这也自然流露了还是眷念着黄浦江滨的故国故园。但故国于她只不过是一个虚幻的梦，灵魂依旧无所依归。因此她在威尼斯运河回“家”了，留下的却是无尽的悲哀。
    人创造了历史，历史也在创造人、扭曲人和捉弄人。历史发展的曲折动荡过程，总有灵魂的升华，也有灵魂的失落。这些沦落海外的炎黄子孙的悲剧命运，对同样是炎黄子孙而又经历过历史风云变幻的人们的心灵，不会没有感应。
    这部影片没有谢晋电影常见的浑厚，和力透银幕的时代气势与政治热情，以及直接表现的紧扣人物行动的社会环境。这只是一些最普通、最常见的生活片断所呈现的人物性格和情绪的变化。但人物灵魂的困窘却凝聚了社会矛盾，历史的苍桑变化融入了人物的命运。影片没有简单褒贬什么、解答什么，也没有迎合什么或抚慰什么，只是尽量冷静地表现一切。这不会引起“轰动效应”，因为没有给人心灵的慰藉，让人失去了过去惯于欣赏谢晋电影或由谢晋电影感受现实的心理平衡；但可以促使人们直面人生。这会让人感到朦胧，因为影片表现的东西不很简单，创作者也不能做出虽然明确而或许束缚人们想象翅膀的判断；但也可以让人更广阔、更深入领会和思考生活的底蕴。
    也许，“最后的贵族”这种生活素材还于影片创作者有些陌生，或由于其它一时尚难逾越的主观或客观的困难，艺术表现稍嫌拘谨，未尽自如，主要人物的沉浮变化，也不无突兀之处。但是，艺术家的现实体验，却贯通了全片。
    和谢晋过去的电影比，《最后的贵族》显得冷峻，也较深沉。一直处于稳定状态的谢晋电影的这种变化，自然是艺术家对现实人生的一种深入体验、对艺术创作的一种独特追求的表现；但同时，这不也是历史给予艺术家的一种选择么？
