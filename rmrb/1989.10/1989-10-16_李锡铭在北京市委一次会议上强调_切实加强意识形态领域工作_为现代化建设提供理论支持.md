Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 15th.

At the closing of the seventh plenary (expanded) session of the Sixth Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, emphasized the need to face the current domestic and international political climate and to seriously strengthen ideological work, better implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the tasks proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin in his speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Li Ximing said that the recent political turmoil in Beijing has made the entire Party clearly recognize the need to pay great attention to and strengthen leadership in the ideological field. All levels of Party and administrative leadership must attach importance to this work.

Li Ximing said that after the suppression of the riots, we have politically controlled the situation, but this does not mean that the problem has been completely resolved ideologically. Therefore, comrades engaged in propaganda and ideological work must use the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech to help people distinguish right from wrong, unify their thinking, and invigorate the spirits of the broad masses of cadres and the people, concentrating their strength to create a good public opinion environment and scientific theoretical support for the development of socialist modernization in the capital.

Li Ximing stressed that we must remain highly vigilant against the "peaceful evolution" strategy of international reactionary forces to subvert the socialist system. At the same time, we must see that Comrade Zhao Ziyang's errors have caused serious harm to our Party.

Li Ximing pointed out that the key to seriously strengthening ideological work is to firmly strengthen Party leadership and enhance Party consciousness. Today, domestic and foreign hostile forces attempt to undermine the socialist cause and socialist system, first aiming to destroy the core force leading the socialist cause—the Communist Party. This deeply educates us from the opposite side that we must indeed strengthen the Party's own construction and truly uphold Party leadership on all fronts. He required comrades engaged in ideological, cultural, and theoretical work to guide everyone to recognize and deal with this issue in this way.

    李锡铭在北京市委一次会议上强调
    切实加强意识形态领域工作  为现代化建设提供理论支持
    据新华社北京10月15日电（记者徐光春、罗晓路、黄智敏）中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委书记李锡铭在今天闭幕的中共北京市委六届七次全体（扩大）会议上强调指出，要面对当前国内外政治气候的实际，切实重视和加强意识形态领域的工作，更好地贯彻落实好党的十三届四中全会精神和江泽民同志在庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年大会上的讲话中所提出的各项任务。
    李锡铭说，前不久在北京发生的那场政治风波，使我们全党清醒地认识到必须十分重视和加强对意识形态领域工作的领导。不管是党的还是行政的各级领导，都必须重视这项工作。
    李锡铭说，平息暴乱后，我们从政治上控制了局势，但这不等于从思想上彻底解决了问题。因此，我们从事宣传、思想工作的同志，一定要用党的十三届四中全会的精神，用江泽民同志的讲话，帮助人们分清是非，统一思想，使广大干部、群众把精神振奋起来，把力量凝聚起来，为发展首都的社会主义现代化建设事业提供良好的舆论环境和科学的理论支持。
    李锡铭强调说，我们对国际反动势力为颠覆社会主义制度的“和平演变”战略必须保持高度的警惕，同时，要看到赵紫阳同志的错误给我们党造成的危害是严重的。
    李锡铭指出，切实重视和加强意识形态领域的工作，关键就是必须坚定地加强党的领导，增强党的观念。当今，国内外敌对势力妄图摧垮社会主义事业和社会主义制度，首先是要搞垮领导社会主义事业的核心力量——共产党。这从反面深刻地教育我们，必须切实加强党的自身建设，真正在各条战线上坚持党的领导。他要求从事思想、文化、理论工作的同志一定要引导大家这样来认识这个问题、对待这个问题。
