The book lovers of Beijing have been frequenting the Labor People's Cultural Palace recently—from October 9 to 22, the second National Book Fair, organized by the New China Bookstore General Store and the Beijing New China Bookstore, along with the participation of 29 provincial-level bookstores and 6 distribution centers, has attracted them.

Originally, due to the need for readers to pass through alleys and enter the book fair from the side door of the Cultural Palace, the organizers were concerned that this might affect sales. However, as the saying goes, "Good wine needs no bush," in just the first 8 days, the book fair had already welcomed over 400,000 readers from Beijing and other regions, selling 1.45 million yuan worth of various books. The enthusiasm of the readers truly delighted the organizers.

Political Books Regain Popularity

Among the 40,000-plus items on display and for sale at the book fair, philosophy and social science books were particularly popular.

Jiang Zemin's important speech on National Day sold over 10,000 copies on the first day of the book fair. Over the past few years, classics such as "The Communist Manifesto," "Capital," "Selected Works of Marx and Engels," "Selected Works of Lenin," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works," which had been unfairly neglected, have regained popularity at the book fair. Every day, individual readers come to purchase these books, and many organizations and groups also come to replenish their stocks. Books reflecting the tremendous achievements of various industries over the past 40 years, as well as specialized works on the history of the founding of the nation, "Today's Soviet Union Series," "Warnings from Sociologists," and "Warnings from Economists" are also very popular.

Science and Technology Books in High Demand

The science and technology book sections at the book fair had prepared nearly 8,000 natural science books, and almost every item was selected by readers. Whether it was specialized works in the fields of science and engineering, or practical technical books; whether it was deep and extensive volumes or popular small booklets, all were well-received. Books in the fields of medicine and health, computer science, architecture, mechanical engineering, and other applied sciences were particularly popular. Various handbooks and practical reference books, especially those from different provinces, were also in high demand. Previously, books on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and exercise books had been slow to sell, but at the book fair, they were also selling well.

It is worth noting that due to the development of part-time education in various regions and enterprises, as well as the discrepancies in the supply of textbooks through multiple channels, a significant portion of the readers came to the book fair to purchase large quantities of college and university textbooks. In just a few days, the business department at the book fair had already received orders for tens of thousands of textbooks. However, due to the large quantity and urgent need for textbooks, it was often difficult to meet the demand.

Literary Classics Endure

The nationwide campaign to "clean up" the market has achieved initial success, and the book market has become increasingly clean. This can be seen from the sales of literary books at the book fair. The manager of the Beijing Writers' Bookstore, who had initially only wanted to "join in the fun," said that their 1,000-plus literary books sold 25,000 yuan in just four days, equivalent to half a month's sales at the usual bookstore. Chinese classical literary masterpieces such as "Journey to the West," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," as well as poetry collections by Li Bai, Du Fu, and Li Shangyin, and foreign literary classics such as "Jane Eyre," "Anna Karenina," "The Red and the Black," "Les Misérables," and "The Decameron" are still popular. Works by modern Chinese literary masters such as "The Complete Works of Ye Shengtao" and "The Complete Works of Zhu Ziqing," as well as biographical literature such as "The Life of Confucius" and "The Family of Mao Zedong" are also in high demand.

Since the "clean up" campaign, the book market has become much cleaner, but there are still a considerable number of "street literature" enthusiasts who want to find books to read. Currently, there are still too few works that are both healthy and beneficial and captivating. The broad masses of young readers and state-owned book publishers are eagerly awaiting responsible writers to contribute more excellent works to society.

Life and Living Books Sell Well

Books with new and practical content on life and living are particularly popular at the book fair, reflecting the continuous improvement in people's living standards. Books on art, photography, calligraphy, chess, and painting, as well as cookbooks, fashion, beauty, makeup, fitness, and bodybuilding are all selling well. Books on martial arts, qigong, and chess, as well as books on sports theory, competition rules, and training techniques, are also particularly popular as the steps of the 11th Asian Games approach.

Collection Consciousness Grows

At the book fair, a common sight is readers complaining about high book prices and frequent price increases, yet still eagerly purchasing expensive books. The 1989 new edition of "Cihai" (a comprehensive Chinese dictionary) and "Concise Britannica Encyclopedia," priced at around 200 yuan each, sold dozens of sets in just a week. Professional reference books such as "Pharmacopoeia" and "Acupuncture Chart," priced at several dozen yuan each, as well as comprehensive dictionaries and reference books such as "Twenty-Four Histories" and "Encyclopedia of China," priced at several dozen yuan per set, are continuously being purchased by book lovers. Many of them believe that books are wealth, have practical value, and have collection value. Even if the price is high, they still want to buy, believing that spending money now can benefit future generations.

### 书市迷住了读书人

　　书市迷住了读书人
　　许起翌
    京华的读书人近来往劳动人民文化宫走得勤了——10月9日至22日，由新华书店总店、北京市新华书店主办及全国29个省级书店和6个发行所协办的第二届全国书市吸引着他们。
    本来，由于读者得穿过小巷从文化宫侧门绕进书市，主办者颇担心这会影响销售。谁知“酒好不怕巷子深”，仅头8天，书市便已接待北京和外埠读者40余万人次，销售各类图书145万元。读者的热情真使组织者们喜出望外。
    政治书籍重获青睐
    在书市优选陈列销售的4万多个品种中，哲学、社会科学类图书销路较畅。
    江泽民同志国庆重要讲话，书市第一天就销了1万多册。近几年里受到不应有冷遇的《共产党宣言》、《资本论》、《马恩选集》、《列宁选集》、《毛泽东选集》、
  《毛泽东著作选读》等经典著作，在书市又热了起来，每天都有个人读者前来购买，机关团体前来添配的也为数不少。反映各行各业建国40年巨大成就的专著、建国史专著、《今日苏联丛书》、《社会学家对社会的警告》、《经济学家对社会的警告》等政治类丛书也很畅销。
    科技图书颇为抢手
    各科技图书销售处为书市准备的七八千个自然科学类图书，几乎所有品种都有读者选购。无论是理、工科专著，还是实用技术读物；无论是内容艰深的大部头，还是普及性小册子，均受惠顾。医药卫生、计算机科学、建筑工程、机械工业等应用学科类图书尤受欢迎；各种手册类实用工具书，特别是各省版手册类实用工具书销路更好。此前曾经滞销的数、理、化专著和习题类图书在书市也销售看好。
    值得注意的是，由于各地区、各厂矿企业业余教育事业的发展，以及教材供应中多渠道发行出现的偏差，来书市持单批量寻购大中专教材的份额可观，几天里到书市业务组添配教材的就有数万册，然而由于教材需求品种少、数量大、时间急，往往难以满足。
    文学名著历久不衰
    全国性大张旗鼓的“扫黄”取得初步成效，图书市场日益净化，文学名著又获得应有的地位，这可以从书市的文学类图书销售中找到印证。原本仅想“凑凑热闹”的北京作家书店经理说，他们带来的1000多种文学图书，4天销了2.5万元，相当于平时书店半个月的销售额。中国古典文学名著《西游记》、《红楼梦》、《三国演义》和李白、杜甫、李商隐等人的诗集，外国文学名著《简·爱》、《安娜·卡列尼娜》、《红与黑》、《悲惨世界》、《十日谈》等仍畅销不衰；中国现代文学名家作品如《叶圣陶文集》、《朱自清全集》等，传记文学《孔子传》、《毛泽东家世》等也很抢手。
      “扫黄”以来，图书文化市场干净多了，但为数相当多的“地摊文学”爱好者仍然想找书看，当前能适合他们阅读的，既健康有益又引人入胜的作品还太少太少。广大青年读者及国营图书发行者殷切期待着有责任感的作家们早日为社会奉献出更多的优秀作品。
  生活类书销售见俏
    内容新颖实用的生活类用书在书市特别受欢迎，这反映了人民群众的生活水平在不断提高。美术、摄影、琴棋书画方面的图书以及菜谱、服装、美容、化妆、健身、健美方面的读物都很好销。武术、气功、棋牌方面的书籍，以及体育理论、竞赛规则、训练技法等方面的图书，随着一天天走近的十一届亚运会的脚步声，也格外受到读者青睐。
    收藏意识逐渐增强
    书市上，经常可见的一种现象是，读者一面抱怨书价高，涨价快，一面又毫不迟疑地掏出上百元购买贵重图书。定价200元左右的1989年新版
  《辞海》和《简明不列颠百科全书》，一周内便销掉四五十套。几十元一部的“药典”、“针灸挂图”等专业性工具书，几十元一套的辞典、《二十五史》、《中国大百科全书》等综合性辞典工具书，不断被一批批读书爱好者购去，他们中不少人都说，书是财富，有使用价值，有收藏价值，定价再高也要买，认为现在花点钱将来可以惠及子孙。
