	“Iron Merchant” Li Xueda

	Li Xueda, the deputy director of the Cangzhou City Administration for Industry and Commerce in Hebei Province, is a local resident with many relatives and acquaintances. Facing a complex web of relationships, he always adheres to one principle: follow the law, not personal connections.

	Li Xueda has a cousin named Gao, who runs a coffee shop in the bustling downtown area. The business is thriving. However, to save money, Gao refused to pay rent to the original landlord, leading to a dispute. Both parties took the issue to the city's Administration for Industry and Commerce Arbitration Court. After mediation failed, the chief arbitrator of the city's Arbitration Court, Li Xueda, announced: “Gao’s lease agreement with the original landlord has expired. Order the suburban branch of the Administration for Industry and Commerce to revoke his business license!” Upon hearing this arbitration decision, Gao was stunned and couldn't believe his ears. “Who turns their elbows outward like this?” Gao’s entire family visited Li Xueda’s office and home like a revolving door.

	On this day, Gao brought a basket of crabs to Li Xueda’s home, saying, “If you don’t interfere anymore, I win!” “I will see this through to the end. If I don’t handle what I should, how can I call myself a Communist Party member?” Li Xueda’s response was firm. “You don’t recognize your kin!” Gao cursed and left in a huff.

	Li Xueda also has a relative who was penalized by the city's Administration for Industry and Commerce in 1982. This relative has been trying to overturn the decision ever since. After multiple investigations, it was found that the case was handled correctly, and Li Xueda firmly upheld the original decision. This relative harassed the office, only to be reprimanded by Li Xueda on the spot, turning red in the face, and left in dismay.

	Li Xueda has worked at the city's Administration for Industry and Commerce for 12 years. Not only does he maintain an iron will with his relatives, but he also dares to confront any leader who breaks the law. He insists on investigating cases to the bottom. While cleaning up and rectifying a company, it happened that the company's manager was his old superior from years past. Someone reported that the company had illegal business operations, and Li Xueda immediately sent people to investigate. Soon, intermediaries came one after another, but Li Xueda turned them all away. The result was that the company was found to have illegally traded important production materials, with illegal gains of over 290,000 yuan. Then, someone sent a message: “Old Li, the amount of the fine is up to you.” Li Xueda replied, “According to the regulations, all illegal gains will be confiscated. One of the key points of corruption is using power for transactions. Communist Party members must not engage in such transactions!”

	Li Xueda firmly pursues legal responsibility for illegal behavior, regardless of how powerful the offender is or what background they have. To intercept contraband, he often works with his colleagues late into the night, forgetting sleep. One by one, the “official speculators” received their due punishments, and Li Xueda’s nickname “Iron Merchant” spread.

　　“铁工商”李学达
　　新华社记者　吕凤坡
    河北省沧州市工商局副局长李学达是当地人，亲戚多，熟人多。面对复杂的关系网，他始终坚持一条原则：认理不认人。
    李学达有个表弟高某，在闹市开咖啡馆，生意兴隆。但是为了省钱，高某竟不向原房主交房租，于是引起纠纷，双方闹到市工商局经济仲裁庭。经调解无效，市经济仲裁庭首席仲裁员李学达宣布：“高某与原房主租赁合同期限已过，责令郊区工商分局吊销其营业执照！”听了这个仲裁决定，高某懵然，一时竟不相信自己的耳朵。“哪有胳膊肘往外扭的？”表弟的全家像走马灯似地跑到李学达的办公室和家中。
    这一天，表弟带着一筐螃蟹又来到李学达家，声称：“这事，只要你不再管，我就赢了！”“这事，我要管到底。该管的不管，还叫共产党员？”李学达的回答斩钉截铁。“你六亲不认！”表弟高某骂骂咧咧地走了。
    李学达还有一个亲戚，1982年被市工商局处罚过。这个亲戚一直想翻案。经多次调查，这个案子处理无误，李学达坚决维持原决定。这个亲戚到局办公室纠缠，被李学达当场批评得面红耳赤，只好悻悻而去。
    李学达在市工商局工作12年，不仅对亲戚铁面无私，任何领导干部只要违法，他都敢碰，非把案子查个水落石出不可。清理、整顿一个公司时，恰逢公司经理是他以往相处多年的老上级。有人反映这个公司有违法经营的行为，李学达马上派人去调查。不久，说情者纷至沓来，李学达一一顶了回去。结果查实：该公司倒卖重要生产资料，违章经营非法所得29万余元。接着，有人捎话来：“老李，罚多罚少就在你一句话了。”李学达回答：“按规定，将非法所得全部没收。腐败现象的重要一点就是用权力作交易，共产党员决不能作这种交易！”
    对违法行为，李学达坚决依法追究，不管案犯有多大“来头”，有什么“背景”。为了截堵赃物，他经常和局里的小伙子一起，深夜出击，废寝忘食。一个个“官倒”受到应有的处理，李学达“铁工商”的绰号也随之流传开来。
