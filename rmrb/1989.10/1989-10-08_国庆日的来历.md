In the minds of many, 40 years ago on October 1st, tens of thousands of military personnel and civilians gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing for the grand opening ceremony of the founding of the People's Republic of China. However, this impression is not entirely accurate. The ceremony held on October 1st, 1949, in Tiananmen Square was the grand ceremony for the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, not the opening ceremony of the founding of the nation. The headline of the news released by the People's Daily that day was "The Grand Ceremony for the Establishment of the Central People's Government is Held Today in the Capital." The grandeur of that day is still completely recorded in a film archive preserved in the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

In fact, the "founding" of the People's Republic of China, that is, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, had been announced a week before October 1st that year. It was not called the "opening ceremony of the founding" but the "grand ceremony of the founding," which took place on September 21st, 1949. On that day, Mao Zedong, the chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, announced the birth of New China in his opening speech at the first session of the conference.

On the day the conference opened, Xinhua News Agency sent a telegram: "The grand ceremony of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which the Chinese people have longed for—the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference—opened at 7:30 PM today in Beiping." On September 22nd, the People's Daily published an editorial titled "The Old China has perished, and the New China has been born!"

The above documents indicate that the People's Republic of China was established on September 21st, 1949. So, what is the significance of October 1st as National Day? As a commemorative day, its origin is as follows: On the afternoon of October 9th, 1949, the first session of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in the Hall of Purity in Zhongnanhai. At the meeting, Xu Guangping spoke: "Comrade Ma Xulun is unable to attend and has asked me to convey his message that the People's Republic of China should have a National Day, so he hopes that this conference will decide to designate October 1st as National Day." Lin Boqu said, "The Double Tenth Day is no longer our National Day, so we should designate October 1st as National Day. Does everyone have any objections? It would be best to decide after discussion." Mao Zedong said, "We should make a proposal and suggest it to the government for a decision."

On December 2nd, 1949, the Central People's Government passed the "Resolution on the National Day of the People's Republic of China," stipulating that October 1st of each year would be National Day, and that day would be used to proclaim the establishment of the People's Republic of China. From then on, October 1st of each year became a grand holiday celebrated by all ethnic groups in the country, while the "grand ceremony of the founding" on September 21st, 1949, gradually faded from people's memory. The ceremony for the establishment of the Central People's Government on October 1st of the same year was called the "opening ceremony of the founding," and it became more and more widely known.

    国庆日的来历
    在许多人的印象中，40年前的10月1日在北京天安门广场举行了有数十万军民参加的中华人民共和国开国大典。其实，人们头脑中的这一印象并不准确，因为，1949年10月1日在天安门广场举行的典礼是中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立盛典，而不是开国大典。当天《人民日报》所发消息的标题即为“中央人民政府成立盛典今日在首都隆重举行”。当时的盛况在今天全国政协档案处保存的一部影片档案中还有着完整的记录。
    实际上，中华人民共和国的“开国”，也就是说中华人民共和国的成立，早在当年10月1日之前一个星期就已经宣布过了。当时也不叫“开国大典”，而是称作“开国盛典”，时间是1949年9月21日。这一天，中国人民政治协商会议筹备会主任毛泽东在政协第一届会议上所致的开幕词中就已经宣告了新中国的诞生。
    在政协开幕的当天，新华社发出电讯：“中国人民所渴望的中华人民共和国开国盛典——中国人民政治协商会议，已于今日下午七时半在北平开幕。”9月22日《人民日报》发表了题为“旧中国灭亡了，新中国诞生了！”的社论。
    以上文献说明，中华人民共和国的成立是在1949年9月21日。那么10月1日的国庆日又是怎么回事呢？作为一个纪念日它的来历是这样的：1949年10月9日下午三时，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第一次会议在中南海勤政殿召开。会上，许广平发言说：“马叙伦委员请假不能来，他托我来说，中华人民共和国的成立，应有国庆日，所以希望本会决定把10月1日定为国庆日。”林伯渠说：“过去双十日已不是我们现在的国庆日，所以要以10月1日为国庆日，大家有没有意见，最好讨论后决定。”毛泽东说：“我们应作一提议，向政府建议，由政府决定。”
    1949年12月2日，中央人民政府通过《关于中华人民共和国国庆日的决议》规定每年10月1日为国庆日，并以这一天作为宣告中华人民共和国成立的日子。从此，每年的10月1日就成为全国各族人民隆重欢庆的节日了，而1949年9月21日的“开国盛典”则渐渐不为人们提起，同年10月1日的中央人民政府成立盛典则被称作“开国大典”，越叫越响，越传越广了。
