In the first half of this year, China's bicycle market experienced an unprecedented slump, with a total inventory of commercial and industrial stocks reaching over 13 million units. Moreover, the current inventory is still rising. Many bicycle factories are in dire straits.

In the first half of the year, the country produced over 19 million bicycles, yet such a large number were left unsold. Has the bicycle market become saturated? According to estimates, the current national bicycle ownership is approximately 240 million units, but there are significant regional disparities. For example, Zhejiang Province has 84 bicycles per 100 people, while Gansu Province has only 10 per 100 people. The bicycle ownership in rural areas is also much lower than in urban areas. Remote regions and rural areas have considerable market potential. Additionally, existing bicycles will gradually need to be replaced. China is a developing country with over 800 million farmers, with relatively backward economic and road conditions. For a considerable period, bicycles will remain the primary means of transportation for many people. It can be said that the current bicycle market is not yet saturated. The annual demand for bicycle replacements and new purchases is estimated to be around 35 million units in the coming years.

If the market is not saturated, why did the bicycle market experience a noticeable decline this year? The analysis points to several reasons: first, the purchasing frenzy last year caused some consumers to buy in advance, affecting this year's sales; second, market stabilization and the implementation of value-preserving savings by banks have shifted consumer behavior from storing goods to saving money; third, the decline in bicycle quality, high prices, and outdated designs have deterred consumers from purchasing. Many consumers have noted that some bicycles have rough exteriors, peeling paint, and poor welding, making them difficult to satisfy.

Currently, there are over 80 bicycle manufacturing companies with permits from the Ministry of Light Industry, with an annual production capacity of over 50 million units. The bicycle market has shifted to a buyer's market. In this competitive environment, bicycle enterprises must focus on the market, improve product quality, increase variety, enhance management, and reduce costs to overcome current difficulties and maintain a competitive edge. A notable feature of this year's bicycle inventory is that branded bicycles are more affected than non-branded ones. Consumers have pointed out that branded bicycles are more expensive, averaging 80 to 100 yuan more per unit than non-branded ones, yet the materials and quality are similar. Some branded bicycles have many cooperative factories, leading to quality issues, making the high price for the brand name unworthy. This further emphasizes that bicycle manufacturers should prioritize increasing variety, improving product quality, and reducing costs.

Developing international markets is another avenue for bicycle enterprises. In recent years, China's bicycle exports have been increasing annually, but the export ratio is still only 5% of the total production, far behind Taiwan and South Korea. The main issues are outdated designs, low grades, and unstable quality, which cannot adapt to the changing international market. It seems that increasing variety and improving quality are problems that both domestic sales and exports must address. Only by genuinely solving these issues can bicycles find a market.

　　自行车企业出路何在
　　景曦　林希山　王孟彦
    今年上半年我国自行车市场出现前所未有的滞销形势，商业和工业积压总库存量已高达1300多万辆。而且，目前库存量仍在继续上升。不少自行车厂陷入困境。
    上半年，全国共生产自行车1900多万辆，竟积压了这么多。是自行车市场饱和了吗？据估算，目前，全国自行车拥有量约为2.4亿辆，但各地差异又很大。比如，浙江省每百人拥有自行车84辆，而甘肃省每百人只有10辆。农村自行车拥有量又大大低于城市。偏远地区、农村自行车市场潜力很大。而且，原有的自行车也陆续需要更新。我国是一个拥有8亿多农民的发展中国家，经济条件和道路条件都比较落后，自行车在相当长的时间内仍将是人们的主要的代步交通工具。可以说目前自行车市场尚不饱和。每年需要更新的自行车和新增的需要量，预测近几年每年需要量为3500万辆。
    既然不是饱和，今年自行车市场为什么会出现明显的滑坡呢？据分析，有这样几个原因：第一，去年的抢购风，使一部分消费者提前购买，一定程度上影响了今年的销量；第二，治理整顿，市场稳定，银行实行保值储蓄，消费者由存物转向存钱；第三，自行车质量下降，价格高，款式陈旧，消费者不愿购买。不少消费者反映：一些自行车外观粗糙，爆漆开焊，很难称心。
    目前，全国有轻工部生产许可证的自行车生产厂家80多家，年生产能力达5000多万辆，自行车已转入买方市场。在买方市场中，自行车企业要走出目前的困境，在竞争中立于不败之地，必须以市场为导向，提高产品质量，增加花色品种，改善经营管理，降低成本。今年自行车积压的一个特点是名牌车高于非名牌车。消费者反映，名牌车价格高，平均每辆高于非名牌车80至100元左右，而使用材料和产品质量都差不多，一些名牌车联营厂点多，质量下降，花那么多钱买个牌子不合算。这更说明，自行车生产厂家应该切实把增加花色品种、提高产品质量、降低成本放在首位。
    开发国际市场，是自行车企业的一条出路。近几年我国自行车出口数量逐年增加，但出口比例还只占自行车总产量的5％，远远落后于台湾和南朝鲜。主要问题是产品款式陈旧，档次较低，质量不稳定，不能适应国际市场变化。看来增加花色品种、提高质量是自行车内销和出口都必须解决的问题。只有真正解决了这个问题，自行车才能有市场。
