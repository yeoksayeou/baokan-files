"China's achievements in population planning are well-known. No other country has seen such a significant reduction in its population growth rate. China's achievements have global significance." This was stated by the head of the United Nations Population Fund, Van Arendonk, at the opening of the 10-year cooperation summary conference between China and the United Nations Population Fund held yesterday in Shanghai.

The Chinese government and the United Nations Population Fund have been cooperating for 10 years. During this period, the Chinese government has utilized $100 million in aid from the Population Fund to establish over 60 cooperative projects, importing relatively advanced equipment to produce contraceptives. The Chinese government has also invested 690 million yuan in matching funds. This year, the United Nations Development Programme approved a $57 million aid plan for China, which will begin implementation next year.

Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Shen Jueren, also spoke at the meeting.

    中国计划生育成就可喜
    本报上海10月18日电　“中国人口方案所取得的成就是众所周知的。世界上没有一个国家能够使人口增长率出现这么大幅度的下降。中国取得的成就对全球有着重要的意义。”昨天在上海开幕的中国与联合国人口基金会合作10年总结大会上，联合国人口基金会负责人范·阿伦唐克赞扬我国在计划生育方面取得的成就。
    我国政府与联合国人口基金已合作10周年。这10年中，我国政府利用人口基金提供的1亿美元援助，建立了60多个合作项目，从国外引进了较先进的设备以生产避孕药、器具。我国自己投入配套资金6.9亿元人民币。今年，联合国开发署又批准了总额为5700万美元的援华方案，将于明年起开始实施。
    经贸部副部长沈觉人也在会上讲了话。
