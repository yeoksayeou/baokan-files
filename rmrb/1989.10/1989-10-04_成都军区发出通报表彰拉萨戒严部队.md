The Chengdu Military Region recently issued a notice commending all officers and soldiers of the Lhasa martial law troops.

Over the past half year, the Lhasa martial law troops have braved the severe high-altitude environment to vigilantly carry out their duties. They have uncovered a batch of illegally carried firearms and ammunition, confiscating over 450 knives and other lethal weapons, making important contributions to maintaining stability and unity in Tibet. The Lhasa martial law troops have actively carried out civilized patrol competitions, with 39 civilized patrol points and over 1,500 civilized patrol individuals emerging. They strictly adhere to discipline, do not take even a needle or thread from the people, and wholeheartedly serve the Tibetan people, bringing warmth and comfort. According to incomplete statistics, over the past half year, they have voluntarily planted 15,000 trees, treated nearly 10,000 patients, repaired over 2,100 vehicles, and fixed over 1,500 various electrical appliances.
