Recently, the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, announced a new discovery about Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting, the *Mona Lisa*: An American physicist used space photography technology to take a "special photograph" of the painting. The photograph was then scanned and converted into data, which was input into a computer center in California, USA. The result revealed that the original painting featured a "strap" made of white dots around the neck of the Mona Lisa! Experts believe this might have been a pearl necklace painted by the artist, which was later erased for some unknown reason.

Currently, the Louvre plans to use infrared scanning technology for further examination of the painting. Additionally, laser photography technology is expected to help reveal the "sketch" of the work in its unfinished state.

These modern photographic technologies allow people today to clearly understand the artist's original conception, ideas, and modifications made during the creation of the *Mona Lisa*. Experts claim that if contemporary people can gain a more in-depth and detailed understanding of the creative work of this ancient art master, then a more satisfactory explanation of the centuries-old mystery of the Mona Lisa's "enigmatic smile" may be possible.

　　蒙娜丽莎的项链
    最近，法国巴黎的卢浮宫又宣布了一项关于达·芬奇的名画《蒙娜丽莎》的新发现：一位美国物理学家利用太空摄影技术对该画作了一次“特别摄影”，然后将照片扫描后变成数据，输入美国加州的电脑中心，结果发现：画上的蒙娜丽莎的颈项上原有一条由白点串成的“带子”！专家们认为这可能是画家画上的一根珠链，不知怎么后来被擦掉了。
    眼下，罗浮宫计划利用红外线扫描技术对该画作进一步考察。此外，激光摄影技术也可望帮助发现该作品未完成时的“草图”的“原貌”。
    这些现代化的摄影技术可使今天的人们清楚了解艺术家当时创造《蒙娜丽莎》时的构思、设想，以及所作的修改等。专家们声称，如果当代人能对这位古代艺术大师的创造性劳动有更深入细致了解的话，那么对数百年来令人困惑的蒙娜丽莎的“神秘的微笑”便有望作出更为满意的解释。
