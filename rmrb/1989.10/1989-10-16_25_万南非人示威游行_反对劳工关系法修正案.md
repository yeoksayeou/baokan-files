Xinhua News Agency, Harare, October 14th.

Approximately 250,000 South Africans today took to the streets in 17 cities across the country to protest against the proposed amendments to the Labor Relations Law.

The organizers of the protest, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, condemned the amendments, stating that they strip South African workers of their legal rights and dignity.

In Pretoria, around 4,000 protesters sang songs demanding freedom and chanted slogans as they marched from the Congress of South African Trade Unions' Pretoria branch to the city center, where they submitted a letter of protest against the Labor Relations Law amendments to the relevant authorities.

In Johannesburg, South Africa's largest industrial city, about 15,000 people took to the streets to protest against the Labor Relations Law amendments and to celebrate the imminent release of eight political prisoners, including Walter Sisulu, the former General Secretary of the African National Congress.

On the same day, protests were also held in cities such as Durban, Bloemfontein, and Port Elizabeth.
