State Councilor Zhou Jiahua, at the opening of the National Agricultural Mechanization Conference today, said that we should advance agricultural mechanization according to our national conditions and capabilities, in two steps, striving to achieve the strategic goal of nationwide basic agricultural mechanization by the middle of the next century.

Zhou Jiahua proposed the strategic vision: the first step, by the end of this century, in economically developed regions, commercial grain production areas, suburban areas of large cities, and state-owned farms, to develop and gradually realize mechanization of the majority of major crop and key livestock breeding operations; in other regions, to select certain operations to basically realize mechanization. The second step, by the middle of the next century, in economically developed regions, to realize a higher degree of mechanization in places where mechanized operations can be used; in other regions, to realize mechanization of major operations.

Given that China has a large population, limited land, and a weak foundation, does this conflict with the development of agricultural mechanization? In response to this question, Zhou Jiahua pointed out that the development of mechanization must start from China's national conditions, adhering to the policy of focusing on increasing land productivity and the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. However, the development of agricultural productivity cannot do without advanced tools like agricultural machinery. He said that the implementation of the responsibility system for production and the development of mechanization are not in conflict. Currently, the agricultural machinery production sector is increasing the production of small agricultural machinery, and farmers are gradually increasing their purchases of agricultural machinery.

Regarding the fact that China's agricultural mechanization once took a detour under the influence of "leftist" ideological guidance, Zhou Jiahua emphasized that the development of China's agricultural mechanization must be adapted to the development of the secondary and tertiary industries, diversified operations, and the transfer of surplus rural labor; it must be adapted to the development of the rural economy and the level of prosperity of the farmers; it must be adapted to the development of the national industry. Therefore, the realization of agricultural mechanization in China will be a relatively long process.

　　邹家华在全国农业机械化工作会议上说
　　按国情国力推进农机化
    本报北京10月25日讯　记者江夏报道：国务委员邹家华，在今天开幕的全国农业机械化工作会议上说，要按照国情、国力，分两步走，争取到下个世纪中叶达到全国基本上实现农业机械化的战略目标。
    邹家华提出的战略设想是：第一步，到本世纪末，经济发达地区、商品粮集中产区、大城市郊区、国营农牧渔场等，先一步发展和逐步实现主要作物、重点养殖业大部分作业项目的机械化；其它地区，要有选择地在某些作业项目中基本实现机械化。第二步，到下个世纪中叶，经济发达地区，在能够使用机械操作的地方，实现较高程度的机械化；其它地区主要作业项目实现机械化操作。
    我国人多地少底子薄，这与发展农业机械化是否相矛盾？针对这种疑问，邹家华指出，发展机械化要从我国国情出发，坚持以提高土地产出率为重点和农林牧副渔各业综合发展的方针，但是发展农业生产力离不开作为先进工具的农业机械。他说，联产承包责任制的推行与机械化的发展也不矛盾，现在农机生产部门增加了小型农机的生产，农民购买农机具正逐年增加。
    谈到我国的农业机械化曾在“左”的指导思想影响下走过的一段弯路，邹家华强调说，我国农业机械化的发展，一是要和发展第二、三产业、多种经营、农村剩余劳力的转移相适应；二是要和农村经济发展与农民富裕程度相适应；三是要和国家工业的发展相适应。因此，我国实现农业机械化将是一个较长的过程。
