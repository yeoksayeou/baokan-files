Finding a place to live in Paris is becoming increasingly difficult, especially when looking for a good location at a reasonable price. For an average family with both spouses working, renting a home often means using one person's salary to cover the rent.

Over the past five years, housing prices in the Paris region have doubled, with a 25% increase last year compared to the previous year. If the housing price index was 100 in 1983, it reached 206 last year. Now, the average selling price of houses in the Paris city area is over 10,000 francs per square meter. The most expensive ones are approaching 30,000 francs. The reporter visited a retired middle school principal's home, a three-bedroom apartment that she bought for 700,000 francs three years ago and is now valued at 1 million francs. Paris residents say that buying a house is a good way to preserve the value of money. This surge in housing prices is related to population movements. In the 1970s, city residents who were accustomed to urban life moved to the suburbs or countryside in search of tranquility, causing the prices of country villas to skyrocket. As the urban population decreased, many companies and enterprises moved into Paris.

In the 1980s, Europeans were attracted by the modern urban lifestyle of the United States and began to long for city life again. After a few years of comparison, people found that urban life was more convenient and comfortable, with more choices for children's education and employment. Thus, they sold their country houses and moved back to the city. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the 1992 European Single Market, businesspeople from various countries saw Paris as an important European city and began to purchase real estate. The interest of the Japanese was even greater, with Japanese companies and product advertisements becoming increasingly common in Paris, especially in bustling areas like the Champs-Élysées and the Opera House. These developments have led to soaring housing prices and other challenging issues. The French government recently regulated that the rent increase should be limited to within 2.3%.

As housing prices soar, Paris's population is also aging, as few young people can afford comfortable housing in the city of lights. The traditional self-reliance makes them leave home after adulthood, and university graduates face unemployment threats. How can they afford to spend thousands of francs a month on housing in the city area without solving their most urgent needs first? A high-ranking official in the Paris municipal government once said that Paris residents should be younger. However, at least in the near future, this can only be a beautiful wish.

    巴黎：房价暴涨　居民老化
    本报记者　吕网大
    在巴黎找住处越来越难了，特别是要找到地段好、价格又公道的房子更是困难。一个普通家庭两口子都工作，要是租房住，往往得用一个人的工资付房租。
    近5年来，巴黎地区的房价翻了一番，去年比前年涨了25％。如果1983年的房价指数为100，去年的指数则达到206。现在巴黎市区的房屋售价均在每平方米1万法郎以上。最贵的已接近3万法郎。记者参观过一位退休中学校长的家，是一个3居室套房，3年前她是花70万法郎买的，如今报价100万稳可出手。巴黎人说，买房成了货币保值的好办法。这股房价上涨风与人口流动有关。70年代，住惯城市的居民纷纷迁往郊区或乡村去寻求安静，于是乡村别墅的房价倍增。城市居民减少了，许多公司企业则乘虚而入，迁进巴黎。
    进入80年代，欧洲人为美国的现代都市生活方式所吸引，又向往起城市生活来。经过几年生活的比较，人们觉得还是都市生活方便、舒适，子女求学、就业有更多的选择。于是他们卖掉乡间的房子又搬回城里。与此同时，鉴于1992年欧洲统一大市场的前景，各国商人看中了巴黎这个欧洲重要都市，也纷纷购置房地产。日本人的兴趣更浓，在繁华的香榭丽舍大街、歌剧院大街等地段随处可见日本商社，日本产品广告在巴黎街头也越来越多。这些情况带来了房价暴涨等棘手问题。法国政府最近规定，房租上涨幅度须限制在2.3％以内。
    房价在暴涨，巴黎的居民也在老化，因为很少青年人有能力在花都找到一套舒适住房。自食其力的传统使他们成年后离开家庭，大学毕业又面临失业威胁。如何能在没有解决最迫切需要前，就奢望每月花几千法郎在市区找一套住房呢。巴黎市政当局一位要人曾说过，要让巴黎居民更年轻些。可是，至少在近期内，这只能是一种美好的愿望。
