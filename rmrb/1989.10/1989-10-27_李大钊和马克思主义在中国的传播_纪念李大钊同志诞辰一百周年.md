Li Dazhao was the first pioneer in China to choose Marxism

Li Dazhao was the first Marxist in Chinese history, and his name is inseparable from the spread of Marxism in China.

Of course, this does not mean that before Li Dazhao, no one in China had mentioned Marx and his theories. For example, in the late 19th century, some publications by the Shanghai Broad Learning Society mentioned Marx; in 1902, Liang Qichao mentioned Marx in his article "The Theory of Evolutionary Revolutionist Herbert Spencer" published in the *New Citizen Journal*; in 1903, Ma Junwu mentioned "The Communist Manifesto" by Marx in his "Comparing Socialism and Evolutionism" published in *Translation Compilation*; in 1905, Zhu Zhixin mentioned Marx and Engels' biographies and the key points of *The Communist Manifesto* in his "Biographies of German Revolutionary Socialists" published in *The People's Journal*, and so on.

However, can these be considered as the marks of the spread of Marxism in China? The answer is no. This can be analyzed from both subjective and objective perspectives. Subjectively, the authors of these articles did not intend to believe in, spread, or practice Marxism. For instance, the Shanghai Broad Learning Society's publications in the late 19th century merely introduced various socialist theories prevalent in the West as supplements while promoting Christian salvation doctrines; Liang Qichao's introduction of Herbert Spencer's theory included a brief and critical mention of Marx (quoting Spencer's comments on Marx); Zhu Zhixin, although he introduced more about Marx, Engels, and the key points of *The Communist Manifesto*, his purpose was to advocate for combining social revolution with political revolution in one go. Objectively, Marxism did not spread as a result. From the Xinhai Revolution to 1918, there were very few articles introducing Marx, Engels, and their theories in Chinese publications.

Based on the above analysis, the spread of Marxism in China should still be traced back to the May Fourth period, with Li Dazhao as its representative figure.

Like many patriotic scholars and gentlemen in modern China, Li Dazhao also once pursued the political ideals of bourgeois democracy, republicanism, and freedom and equality. He was deeply influenced by various European and American social currents such as the theory of evolution, mutual aid, and humanism. However, none of these led him to find a way out for China. The First World War and the October Revolution made him realize the inherent contradictions of capitalist society that cannot be overcome, the root causes of imperialist aggression, and the exploitation and oppression of the working class and the laboring masses in colonial and semi-colonial countries. He recognized the dawn of socialism, the historical law that socialism will replace capitalism, and thus understood the correctness of Marxism's theory of surplus value and historical materialism, and scientific socialism. Through continuous exploration, discrimination, sublation, and practice, he gradually freed himself from the influence of various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois social currents and ultimately chose Marxism, becoming a pioneer of Chinese communism.

Li Dazhao was an early propagator of Marxism in China

Li Dazhao was the first to enthusiastically sing the praises of and propagate the great significance of the Russian October Revolution. In the articles he wrote in 1918, he began to analyze the causes of the First World War and the October Revolution from the perspective of Marxism. He said: "The real cause of this war lies in the development of capitalism. The boundaries of the state cannot contain its productive forces, so the capitalist government wants to break down the state boundaries through a great war, making its own country the center to build a world empire, forming an economic organization to benefit the capitalist class within its own country. The labor societies of countries like Russia and Germany were the first to see through their ambitions and did not hesitate to launch a social revolution during the great war to prevent the capitalist government's war." (*Victory of the Common People*)

Li Dazhao enthusiastically praised the October Revolution as a victory for laborism and the common people, saying, "From now on, everyone in the world will become common people and thus workers." "We must know that the world from now on will become a world of laborers. We should use this tide to make everyone a worker, not to make everyone a robber." (ibid)

In the May 1919 issue of *New Youth* (Volume 6, Issue 5), Li Dazhao published "My View on Marxism," a lengthy article of over 20,000 characters that was serialized over two issues. The article elucidated the three components of Marxism—historical materialism, political economy, and scientific socialism. This article should be regarded as the mark of Li Dazhao becoming a Marxist.

Before and after this, he clearly advocated for the contemporary public opinion, actively spreading Marxism. In his articles such as "Further Discussion on Problems and Isms," "Material Change and Moral Change," and "Explaining the Causes of Modern Chinese Thought Changes from the Economic Perspective," he not only advocated for using Marx's theories to understand and transform society but also actively promoted combining them with the realities of various countries. He said: "A socialist must study how to apply his ideals to the surrounding reality to the greatest extent." He even proposed: "In our country where bureaucratic robbers who do not engage in production are rampant, we can also use him as a tool to drive out this class of bureaucratic robbers who live without labor."

Li Dazhao not only wrote articles himself but also launched a "Marxism Research" column in *New Youth* and helped the *Morning Post* supplement to open a "Marxism Research" column. From May 5 to November 11, over six months, this column published five works, including Marx's "Labor and Capital," Kautsky's "Explanation of Marx's Capital," and Kawakami Kiyoshi's "Marx's Historical Materialism." In addition to the column, the *Morning Post* supplement also published biographies of some revolutionary leaders (Marx, Lenin, Liebknecht, etc.) and articles introducing the situation of the international communist movement.

The spread of Marxism was carried out in the midst of struggle, as everyone knows, in the 1919 debate on "problems" and "isms," Li Dazhao played a significant role.

In 1920, in addition to continuing to write numerous articles propagating Marxism, Li Dazhao also, in March of that year, secretly initiated a Marxism Study Society with Deng Zhongxia, Gao Junyu, and others at Peking University. This study society established a translation office with English, German, and French groups, translating many works by Marx and Engels. It was not until 1921 that the society became public.

In the autumn of 1920, after officially becoming a professor at Peking University, Li Dazhao continued to expand the propagation of Marxism using the platform of higher education. By the end of 1920, Li Dazhao pointed out: "Recently, 'the professors of history in institutions of higher education have almost all been influenced by historical materialism and are eager to create a new life for society.'" (*The Value of Historical Materialism in Modern Historiography*)

Li Dazhao was a mentor and friend to the youth. Under his influence, many advanced youths not only became intellectuals with initial communist thoughts during the May Fourth period but also quickly became Marxists.

Due to Li Dazhao's historical contributions and role in spreading Marxism, and because he and Chen Duxiu jointly actively engaged in the establishment of the Communist Party of China, he enjoyed the high reputation of "Chen in the South, Li in the North" among the pioneers in the intellectual sphere.

The spread of Marxism led the Chinese people to choose the socialist path

The spread of Marxism in China led to a new leap in the political thoughts of the Chinese people:

First, the spread of Marxism in China enabled the Chinese people to begin to understand imperialism from a rational perspective, moving from sensory to rational understanding.

Before accepting Marxism, the Chinese people, although they had long been fighting against imperialism, did not have a fundamental understanding of it. The laboring masses at the grassroots level only sensed that "foreign devils" were detestable, while the intellectuals at the upper levels "learned from the West" but did not understand why the teacher always invaded the student.

After the spread of Marxism in China, the Chinese people began to understand the essence of imperialism. As mentioned earlier, Li Dazhao had already begun to analyze the causes of the First World War and the October Revolution from the perspective of the contradictions between productive forces and production relations.

On New Year's Day 1919, in his article "Pan-Asianism and New Asianism," Li Dazhao clearly proposed the concepts of national self-determination and imperialism. He pointed out that the "Pan-Asianism" proposed by the Japanese invaders at that time was a "code word for annexing China" and a "euphemism for Japanese imperialism," and said: "This 'Pan-Asianism' is not a peaceful ideology; it is an ideology of aggression; it is not nationalism; it is imperialism that annexes weak nations." "The word 'imperialism' may have appeared in newspapers very early, such as in 1901, there was an article titled 'On the Development of Imperialism and the Future of the 20th Century' that interpreted imperialism as banditry. Again, in 1901, Liang Qichao's 'On the Changes and Differences in National Thought' in *Qingyi Bao* also mentioned the term 'national imperialism.' However, like Li Dazhao, who clearly proposed national self-determination and opposition to imperialism from the perspective of Marxism, this is rare in history. On May 18, in his article "Secret Diplomacy and the Bandit World" in *Weekly Review*, he clearly stated: "Our three great vows are: to reform the bandit world, to not recognize secret diplomacy, and to implement national self-determination."

The above situation strongly supports the following scientific judgment: The Chinese people's understanding of imperialism "was first a superficial sensory stage, manifested in the vague anti-foreign struggles of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement and the Boxer Rebellion, etc. The second stage entered the rational understanding stage, seeing the various contradictions within and outside imperialism, and seeing the essence of imperialism's alliance with the comprador class and the feudal class in China to exploit the Chinese masses. This understanding began around the May Fourth Movement in 1919." (Mao Zedong: *On Practice*)

Second, after the spread of Marxism in China, the Chinese people began to link their fate with that of the world's people.

Before the May Fourth Movement, Li Dazhao's articles on the October Revolution had already begun to recognize this. For example, in his "New Era" article, he wrote: "This new era is the new era of world revolution, the new era of human awakening. In this dark China, this lifeless Beijing, we seem to share a glimpse of the dawn, like seeing a small star in the deep night, illuminating the path to a new life." On October 12, 1919, at the first anniversary meeting of *The Citizen* magazine, Li Dazhao clearly pointed out to the participants of the May Fourth Movement: "This movement is not just a patriotic movement; it is part of the human liberation movement." (*Speech at the First Anniversary Meeting of The Citizen Magazine*)

Third, the spread of Marxism in China made the Chinese intellectuals begin to pay attention to the great power of the working and peasant masses.

In his articles discussing the October Revolution, Li Dazhao pointed out that it was a victory for the common people and laborism. The power demonstrated by Chinese workers and laborers in the May 30th Movement further drew the attention of the intellectuals. In May 1920, in his article "The History of the May 1st Movement," Li Dazhao hoped that China's May 1st Movement would not just be a "movement of a few intellectuals" or a "paper-based movement."

Under Li Dazhao's call and influence, a large number of advanced intellectuals in China went deep into the working and peasant masses and into the actual revolutionary struggles.

Fourth, the spread of Marxism in China made the Chinese people begin to understand the difference between new and old democracy.

In 1922, in his article "Popular Politics and Worker Politics," Li Dazhao pointed out that the old democracy of the bourgeoisie was not true "popular politics," only the new democracy of the proletariat was true "popular politics," "true popular politics cannot be realized without breaking this false parliamentary system"; "now popular politics are developing from the popular politics of the middle class to the popular politics of the proletariat." Following this, he pointed out in his article "The October Revolution and the Chinese People": "All the people of oppressed nations like China should deeply realize their own responsibilities and quickly and without hesitation unite a 'united front of democracy' to build a people's government to resist international capitalism. This is also part of the work of the world revolution." Mao Zedong later expounded on some of these ideas in *On New Democracy*.

On the occasion of Comrade Li Dazhao's 100th birthday, we should commemorate his great achievements in the history of spreading Marxism. Li Dazhao once wrote a couplet in his lifetime:

"With an iron shoulder bearing the moral duty, with a skillful hand writing articles."

His life practiced these two famous sayings, truly bearing the moral duty of communism on his iron shoulder and writing Marxist-Leninist articles with his skillful hand. We should deeply excavate, organize, and study his moral duty and articles from various perspectives because they are "the heritage of the pioneers, a monument in the history of the revolution." (Lu Xun: *Preface to the Complete Works of Zhou Enlai*) These "heritage" and "monuments" not only have practical significance for contemporary people but are also good teaching materials for educating future generations.

　　李大钊和马克思主义在中国的传播
　　——纪念李大钊同志诞辰一百周年
　　彭明
    李大钊是我国最早选择了马克思主义的先驱
    李大钊是我国历史上的第一个马克思主义者，他的名字和马克思主义在中国的传播是分不开的。
    当然，这不是说，在李大钊以前，在中国没有人讲过马克思和他的学说。例如：在19世纪末上海广学会的一些出版物中，有的就提到马克思；1902年，梁启超在《新民丛报》上发表的《进化论革命者颉德之学说》也提过马克思；1903年，马君武在《译书汇编》上写的《社会主义与进化论比较》，在其所附“马克司所著书”中也提到了《共产党宣言》；1905年，朱执信在《民报》上发表的《德意志社会革命家小传》，不仅提到马克思、恩格斯的生平，还讲到《共产党宣言》的要点，等等。
    但是，能否把这些作为马克思主义在中国传播的标志呢？答复是否定的。这可以从主客观两方面来看：从主观方面来看，这些文章的作者无意信仰、传播和实践马克思主义。如上海广学会在19世纪末出版的一些书刊，只是在宣传基督教救世教义的同时，介绍流行于西方的各种社会主义学说以为其补充；梁启超在介绍进化论者颉德学说时，附带提到马克思，不仅简略，而且带有批评的口吻（转引了颉德对马克思的一些评述）；朱执信虽然较多地介绍了马克思、恩格斯及《共产党宣言》的要点，但其目的也只是为了贯彻举社会革命与政治革命“毕其功于一役”的政治主张。从客观方面来看，马克思主义也没有因此传播开来。从辛亥革命以后，直到1918年，在中国报刊上很少看到介绍马克思、恩格斯及其学说的文章。
    根据以上的分析，马克思主义在中国的传播，仍应从五四时期算起，其代表人物还应是李大钊。
    李大钊像近代中国许许多多探求救国真理的志士仁人一样，也曾追求过资产阶级民主共和和自由平等的政治理想，并深受进化论、互助论、人道主义等各种欧美社会思潮的影响。但这一切都未使他找到中国的出路。第一次世界大战和十月革命使他认识到资本主义社会自身不可克服的种种矛盾，认识到资本主义、帝国主义是侵略战争和工人阶级及殖民地半殖民地国家劳苦大众受剥削受压迫的根源，认识到社会主义的新曙光，社会主义必将代替资本主义的社会发展规律，从而认识到马克思主义的剩余价值原理和唯物史观，科学社会主义理论的正确性。经过不断地求索、鉴别、扬弃和实践，他逐渐摆脱各种资产阶级小资产阶级社会思潮的影响，最终选择了马克思主义，成为中国共产主义的先驱者。
    李大钊是马克思主义在中国的早期传播者
    李大钊是热情歌颂和宣传俄国十月革命伟大意义的第一人。他在1918年所写的几篇论文中，即已开始用马克思主义的观点分析第一次世界大战和十月革命的原因。他说：“原来这回战争的真因，乃在资本主义的发展。国家的界限以内，不能涵容他的生产力，所以资本家的政府想靠着大战，把国家界限打破，拿自己的国家做中心，建一世界的大帝国，成一个经济组织，为自己国内资本家一阶级谋利益。俄、德等国的劳工社会，首先看破他们的野心，不惜在大战的时候，起了社会革命，防遏这资本家政府的战争。”（《庶民的胜利》）
    李大钊热情地歌颂了十月革命是劳工主义的胜利，是庶民的胜利，“今后世界的人人都成了庶民，也就都成了工人”。“须知今后的世界，变成劳工的世界。我们应该用此潮流为使一切人人变成工人的机会，不该用此潮流为使一切人人变成强盗的机会。”（同上）
    在1919年《新青年》第6卷第5号上，李大钊发表了《我的马克思主义观》，这是一篇两万多字的长文，曾连载两期。文章对马克思主义的三个组成部分——唯物史观、政治经济学和科学社会主义，都有所阐明。这篇文章应该看作李大钊成为马克思主义者的标志。
    在此前后，他旗帜鲜明地推动当时舆论，积极传播马克思主义。在他发表的《再论问题与主义》、《物质变动与道德变动》、《由经济上解释中国近代思想变动的原因》等文章中，不仅主张用马克思的学说去认识社会和改造社会，而且积极提倡与各国的实际相结合。他说：“一个社会主义者，为使他的主义在世界上发生一些影响，必须要研究怎么可以把他的理想尽量应用于环绕着他的实境。”他甚至提出：“在我们这不事生产的官僚强盗横行的国家，我们也可以用他作工具，去驱除这一班不劳而生的官僚强盗。”
    李大钊不仅亲自撰文，在《新青年》上办了“马克思研究号”，而且帮助《晨报》副刊开辟了一个“马克思研究”专栏。从5月5日到11月11日，在六个多月的时间里，这个专栏共发表了五种论著，其中包括：马克思的《劳动与资本》，考茨基的《马氏资本论释义》、河上肇的《马克思唯物史观》等。除专栏外，《晨报》副刊还用一定篇幅发表了一些革命领袖（马克思、列宁、李卜克内西等）的传记和介绍国际共产主义运动情况的文章。
    马克思主义的传播是在斗争中进行的，如大家所知，在1919年“问题”和“主义”的讨论中，李大钊起了重大作用。
    1920年，李大钊除继续写了大量的宣传马克思主义的文章外，还于当年3月和邓中夏、高君宇等在北京大学秘密发起了一个马克思学说研究会。这个研究会设立了翻译室，下设英文、德文、法文三组，翻译了许多马、恩的著作。直到1921年，研究会才公开。
    1920年秋，李大钊正式担任北大教授后，利用高等学校的讲坛，继续扩大马克思主义的宣传。1920年底，李大钊指出：最近以来，“高等教育机关里的史学教授，几无人不被唯物史观的影响，而热心创造一种社会的新生。”（《唯物史观在现代史学上的价值》）
    李大钊是青年人的良师益友。在他的影响下，许多先进青年不仅在五四时期成为具有初步共产主义思想的知识分子，而且很快地成为马克思主义者。
    由于李大钊在传播马克思主义中的历史贡献和作用，又由于他和陈独秀一齐积极从事组建中国共产党的活动，因而在思想界的先驱者中享有了“南陈北李”的崇高声誉。
    马克思主义的传播使中国人民选择了社会主义道路
    马克思主义在中国的传播，使中国人民的政治思想产生新的飞跃：
    第一，马克思主义在中国传播，使中国人民对帝国主义的认识开始由感性认识上升到理性认识。
      中国人民在接受马克思主义以前，虽然长期地进行了反对帝国主义的斗争，但对帝国主义并没有本质的了解。下层劳动人民只是从感性上认识到“洋鬼子”可恶，上层的知识分子则“学西方”，但不了解为什么先生老是侵略学生。
      从马克思主义在中国传播后，中国人民开始认识到帝国主义的本质。如前所述，李大钊已开始从生产力和生产关系的矛盾分析了第一次世界大战和十月革命的原因。
      1919年元旦，李大钊在《大亚细亚主义与新亚细亚主义》一文中，明确地提出了民族自决和帝国主义的概念。他指出，日本侵略者在当时提出的“大亚细亚主义”是“并吞中国主义的隐语”，是“大日本主义的变名”，并说：“这‘大亚细亚主义’不是平和的主义，是侵略的主义；不是民族自决主义，是吞并弱小民族的帝国主义”。“帝国主义”这个词见诸报端可能很早，如1901年有一篇名为《论帝国主义之发达及二十世纪之前途》的文章，把帝国主义解释为强盗主义。又如梁启超在1901年《清议报》上发表的《国家思想变迁异同论》，也提到过“民族帝国主义”这样一个词。但是，像李大钊这样用马克思主义观点，明确地提出民族自决、反对帝国主义，在历史上是罕见的。5月18日，他在《每周评论》上发表的《秘密外交与强盗世界》一文中，又明确地说：“我们的三大信誓是：改造强盗世界，不认秘密外交，实行民族自决。”
    上述情况，有力地说明了这样一个科学论断：中国人民对于帝国主义的认识，“第一阶段是表面的感性的认识阶段，表现在太平天国运动和义和团运动等笼统的排外主义的斗争上。第二阶段才进到理性的认识阶段，看出了帝国主义内部和外部的各种矛盾，并看出了帝国主义联合中国买办阶级和封建阶级以压榨中国人民大众的实质，这种认识是从一九一九年五四运动前后才开始的。”（毛泽东：《实践论》）
      第二，马克思主义在中国传播后，使中国人民把自己的命运和世界人民的命运联系起来考察。
      “五四”前夕，李大钊撰写的一些关于十月革命的论文，已经开始认识到这一点。例如，他在《新纪元》一文中写道：“这个新纪元是世界革命的新纪元，是人类觉醒的新纪元。我们在这黑暗的中国，死寂的北京，也仿佛分得那曙光的一线，好比在沉沉深夜中得一个小小的明星，照见新人生的道路。”1919年10月12日，李大钊在《国民》杂志周年纪念会上，明确地向五四运动的参加者指出：“此番运动仅认为爱国运动，尚非恰当，实人类解放运动之一部分也。”（《在〈国民〉杂志周年纪念会上的演说》）
      第三，马克思主义在中国的传播，使中国知识界开始重视工农群众的伟大力量。
      李大钊在论述十月革命的论文中，便指出它是庶民的胜利、劳工主义的胜利。中国工人、劳动者在“六三”运动中所表现出的力量，更引起知识界的重视。1920年5月，李大钊在《“五一”May Day运动史》一文中，希望中国人的“五一”运动不只是“三五文人的运动”、“纸面上的笔墨运动”。
      在李大钊的号召和影响下，大量的中国知识界的先进分子，深入到工农群众中去，深入到革命实际斗争中去。
      第四，马克思主义在中国传播，使中国人民开始认识到新、旧民主主义的不同。
      1922年，李大钊在《平民政治与工人政治》一文中，指出资产阶级的旧民主不是真正的“平民政治”，只有无产阶级的新民主才是真正的“平民政治”，“真实的平民政治非打破这虚伪的议会制度必不能实现”；“现在的平民政治正在由中产阶级的平民政治向无产阶级的平民政治发展的途中。”接着，他又在《十月革命与中国人民》一文中指出：“凡是像中国这样的被压迫的民族国家的全体人民，都应该很深刻的觉悟他们自己的责任，应该赶快的不踌躇的联合一个‘民主的联合阵线’，建设一个人民的政府，抵抗国际的资本主义，这也算是世界革命的一部分工作。”毛泽东后来在《新民主主义论》中所阐述的一些论点和这些思想是相吻合的。
      在李大钊同志百年诞辰之际，我们应该纪念他在马克思主义传播史上的丰功伟绩。李大钊同志生前写有一副对联：
  “铁肩担道义，妙手著文章”。他的一生实践了这两句名言，真正是：铁肩担共产主义思想道义，妙手著马列主义文章。对于他的道义、文章，我们应该多方面、深入地挖掘、整理和研究，因为它是“先驱者的遗产，革命史上的丰碑。”（鲁迅：《守常全集》题记）这些“遗产”、“丰碑”不仅对当代的人有现实意义，而且是教育子孙后代的好教材。
