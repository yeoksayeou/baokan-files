Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 9th.

North Korea's Rodong Sinmun today published a commentary condemning the Japanese judicial authorities' attempt to legalize the distortion of invasion history.

According to reports, the Tokyo District Court recently issued a ruling stating that the Japanese Ministry of Education's directive to modify historical textbooks, changing references to Japan's past invasions of China and Korea to "advances" and deleting content about the Nanjing Massacre and the Japanese 731 Unit's use of Chinese people in bacteriological warfare experiments, is "legal."

The commentary states that the Japanese Ministry of Education has distorted Japan's history of invasion against Korea by referring to the Korean people's resistance against Japanese rule as the "March 1st Movement" as a "riot" and claiming that the "Japan-Korea Annexation" was for "peace in Asia."

The commentary points out that the ruling to beautify and justify criminal invasion history is a trampling of justice and facts, and an act of forging history.

The commentary states that the actions of the Japanese authorities are a challenge to the Asian people who have suffered from Japan's invasions, massacres, rule, and plunder in the past.

The commentary states that if the Japanese government truly desires peace, it should immediately stop distorting history and apologize to the Asian people for its invasion crimes.

    谴责日本司法当局篡改侵略历史
    新华社平壤10月9日电  朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表评论，谴责日本司法当局企图使篡改侵略历史合法化。
    据报道，东京地方法院最近作出判决，宣称日本文部省指示将历史教科书中有关日本过去对中国和朝鲜的侵略改为“进出”，删改日军在中国的南京大屠杀和日本731部队以中国人做细菌战试验的内容是“合法”的。
    评论说，日本文部省将朝鲜人民反对日本统治的“三·一”运动说成是“暴动”，“日韩合并”是为了“亚洲的和平”，从而歪曲日本对朝鲜的侵略历史。
    评论指出，对犯罪的侵略历史进行美化和诡辩的判决，是对正义和事实的践踏，是伪造历史的行为。
    评论说，日本当局的这一行动，是对过去饱尝日本侵略、屠杀、统治和掠夺之害的亚洲人民的挑战。
    评论说，日本政府如果真正希望和平，就应该立即停止歪曲历史的行为，并对自己的侵略罪行向亚洲人民道歉。
