The dawn breaks over the small city, and I pull back the pale green curtains, open the window, and a gentle breeze sweeps across my face, intoxicating the heart.

From the height of the building, the small city in the morning mist appears like a hazy poem. Within this poem, 180,000 lives dance to their own rhythms.

Among these 180,000 people, there is a girl. To this day, I still do not know her name or her background. I only remember that she has a pair of bright and calm eyes, gentle yet melancholic.

In the western part of the small city, there stands a large phoenix tree. Underneath its lush, green leaves, there is a noticeable newsstand. She is the owner of this newsstand. In the summer, she often wears a light yellow coat and stands there every day, with a crowd of people gathering around her.

Every morning is the golden hour for the newsstand. She hands out the day's newspapers and newly arrived magazines to readers one by one. I too join the queue to buy newspapers during this golden hour.

This newsstand is the most vibrant in the small city. In the right corner of the window, there is a light yellow vase, and throughout the seasons, various beautiful flowers take turns blooming on the windowsill—lilies, orchids, cherry blossoms, roses, jasmine, lotuses...

At the end of the bookshelf, a "Red Lamp" brand four-speaker stereo plays the sweet voices of the male and female duet singers familiar to the people of our city:

You are like the breeze awakening my soul,
Shy yet full of surprise,
Silently giving me a wildflower,
Bringing me the joy of spring...

Buying newspapers at the newsstand, I often feel an indescribable emotion, as if enveloped in a highbrow artistic atmosphere.

One morning, I again joined the crowd at the newsstand.

The girl's eyes were brighter than usual. She handed me a stack of newspapers and said, "The overseas edition of the People's Daily has selected your essay for its literary supplement."

I was taken aback: How did she know my name? I opened the newspaper, and indeed, it featured an essay I had published in another magazine. I stared at the newsstand girl in amazement.

Her bright eyes returned to their usual calm. "You buy newspapers every day," she said. "Sometimes you buy five or six copies of the same newspaper and ten or eight issues of the same magazine. Over time, I realized you are a writer, right? You often write about the people and events of our small city in various newspapers and magazines, don't you?"

I gazed at her, her eyes gentle yet melancholic.

She then turned to attend to an old man in a Zhongshan suit: "Uncle Zhang, this issue of 'Senior Life' introduces several methods for arranging rockery, quite interesting. You might want to take a look."

The old man took the book, delighted: "Ah, ah, I'll take this one. Thank you."

"Mrs. Wang, today's 'Southern Daily' reports on the experiences of your kindergarten," she said to a woman wearing glasses who had pushed her way forward to receive a stack of newspapers.

From that day on, I knew there was an unnamed friend silently paying attention to my writing. There was no long conversation, only a spiritual connection.

At night, I stood by the window, gazing at the myriad lights of the small city, thinking about the 180,000 people living here. Among them, there are beautiful and kind things, as well as ugly and hateful things. This newsstand girl could be called a green purifier! She adorns the city's life with flowers and songs, caring for people's spiritual lives with her warmth, adding a bit of pleasantness to the city's mornings.

In the night, I seemed to see a pair of bright and calm eyes again...

    报亭少女
    曾錞
    清晨，小城从梦中醒来。我拉开浅绿色的窗幔，推开窗门，清清淡淡的微风袭面，令人心醉。
    从高楼上鸟瞰小城，小城在晨雾中像一首朦胧诗。在这首诗里，跳荡着18万生命的音符。
    18万人口中，有一位少女，至今，我仍不知道她的姓名和身世，我只记得，她有一双明亮而平静的眼睛，温柔而忧郁。
    小城西处，有一棵很大的梧桐。在那翠绿欲滴的肥大叶子下面，有一个引人注目的报亭，她就是报亭的主人。夏天，她常穿着米黄色的风衣，天天站在那里，那里也天天围满了人。
    每天早晨，是报亭的黄金时间。她把当天的报纸、新到刊物送到一个个读者的手中。我也在这黄金钟点加入购报的行列。
    这是小城中最富有生活韵味的报亭。右窗角，有一个乳黄色的花瓶，各个季节，各种美丽的花朵轮流守候在窗台，有百合、兰花，有海棠、玫瑰，有茉莉、荷花……
    书架里端，一个“红灯”牌立体声四喇叭录音机播送着我们这个城里的人所熟悉的男女二重唱歌星的甜美歌声：
    你似微风吹醒我心灵
    羞怯还带着惊喜
    默默地给我一朵野花
    带给我喜悦的春天
    ……
    在报亭前买报，我常感受到一种说不清的情绪，只觉得有一种高雅的艺术氛围。
    一天早晨，我又照例挤到报亭前。
    报亭少女那眼睛明亮于往日，她递给我一叠报纸，说：“《人民日报》海外版副刊作品版又选登了您的散文。”
    我愕然：她怎么知道我的姓名？打开报纸，果然选载了我发于一家刊物的一篇散文。我惊讶地注视着这报亭少女。
    她明亮的眼睛又归于平静：“您每天都买报，有时却一下买了五六张同天报纸，十本八本同期刊物，时长日久，我就发现您是一个作家，对么？你经常在不少报刊上写咱们小城的人和事，是吗？”
    我凝视着她，她的目光温柔而忧郁。
    她又转身照应一个穿中山装的老头：“张伯，这期的《老人生活》，介绍山水盆景的几种组合法，说得挺讲究，您老人家不妨翻翻看。”
    老人接过书，高兴地说：“呵，呵，我就要这本，谢谢。”
    “王阿姨，今天的《南方日报》报道了你们幼儿园的经验，哝。”
    戴眼镜女人也挤上前接住一叠报纸。
    从此，我知道有一位不知名的朋友在默默地关注着我的写作，没有长谈，只有神交。
    深夜里，我在窗口遥望小城的万家灯火，想到这18万人口中，美丽善良、丑恶可憎的事物交杂存在。这报亭少女，可谓是绿色的净化剂吧！她用鲜花、歌曲点缀小城生活小景，用亲切的感情关注着人们的精神生活，给小城的清晨，加添一点点宜人的元素。
    夜色中，我仿佛又看到一双明亮而平静的眼睛……
