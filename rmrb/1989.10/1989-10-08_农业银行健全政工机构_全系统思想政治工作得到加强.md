The Agricultural Bank of China has recently established and improved its political work institutions in accordance with the State Council's directive on setting up political departments in banks. The bank has adjusted and supplemented its political work teams.

The Agricultural Bank headquarters has established a leadership group for ideological and political work under the leadership of the Party Committee, with the bank's president, Ma Yongwei, serving as the group leader. This group is responsible for leading and planning the bank's ideological and political work. All provincial branches have subsequently established leadership groups for ideological and political work under the leadership of the Party Committee, with the branch presidents serving as the group leaders.

From the headquarters to the provincial branches and down to the sub-branches, the bank has selected excellent cadres, not exceeding 1% of the total number of employees, to be assigned or adjusted as full-time political work personnel. Each level of political work institution has clearly defined its supervising department.

At today's Third National Conference on Ideological and Political Work of the Agricultural Bank System, the Chinese Agricultural Bank Staff Ideological and Political Work Research Association was announced to be established.

With the gradual improvement of political work institutions, the Agricultural Bank System has seen a new atmosphere of "reviving old traditions and respecting political work." Leaders at various levels responsible for political work have conducted investigations and research at the grassroots level, exploring effective ways to strengthen the construction of both material and spiritual civilizations and to carry out education on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization in the rural financial sector.

Recently, they have also focused on discovering and promoting model examples, organizing mobile lectures to propagate these examples, and conducting lively and engaging education for the staff.

    农业银行健全政工机构
    全系统思想政治工作得到加强
    本报北京10月7日讯　记者张书政报道：最近，农业银行系统遵照国务院关于银行设政治机构的指示，建立健全政工机构，调整、充实了政工队伍。
    农业银行总行日前成立党组领导下的思想政治工作领导小组，由行长马永伟任组长，负责领导、规划全行思想政治工作。全国各分行相继成立了党组领导下的、以行长为组长的分行思想政治工作领导小组。
    从总行、分行到中心支行所属单位，都按不超过职工总数1％的比例，选择优秀干部，配备或调整了专职政工人员。各级政工机构都明确了上级主管部门。
    在今天召开的全国农行系统第三次思想政治工作会议上，中国农业银行职工思想政治工作研究会宣布成立。
    政工机构逐步健全，农行系统出现“恢复老传统，政工受尊重”的新气象。主管政工的各级行领导到基层调查研究，与政工人员一道探索农村金融部门加强两个文明建设和开展坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化教育的有效途径。
    最近，他们还注意发现典型，组织巡回讲演宣扬典型，对职工进行生动活泼的教育。
