The recently published book "Brief Introduction to Modern Chinese Economic History" by Kuàng Huòlín, published by the Central Institute for Nationalities Press, is a distinctive work of economic history and a commendable economic history textbook.

The most notable feature of this book is its systematic exposition of the economy of China's ethnic minorities and minority regions in modern times. China is a multi-ethnic country. Although ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the total population, according to the 1982 census, their absolute number is over 67 million, and they are widely distributed, covering about 60% of the national territory. The economic history of minority regions is an indispensable and important part of modern Chinese economic history. A major shortcoming of previous research on modern economic history is that there has been more focus on economically developed regions and Han Chinese economics, while economically backward regions and ethnic minority economics have been less studied. Kuàng's work provides a relatively systematic exposition of the economies of ethnic minorities and minority regions, treating them as an organic part of modern Chinese economic history. The book consists of twelve chapters. In addition to Chapter 9, which focuses on the economy of ethnic minorities, four other chapters have sections dedicated to the economy of ethnic minorities, and the remaining chapters also discuss the economy of ethnic minorities. This will help readers understand that in old China, there was a more complex and backward world beyond what is commonly known, although this research is still preliminary, its pioneering efforts should be acknowledged.

The integration of "history" and "theory" is another notable feature of this book. The relationship between "history" and "theory" has long been a subject of debate in the academic community. Undoubtedly, as a branch of history, economic history works rely on economic historical facts and use historical materials to explain issues. This requires extensive research and citation of historical materials, but in-depth research depends on correct theoretical guidance. This book not only mastered the necessary historical materials but also has a solid theoretical foundation, thus achieving the unity of "history" and "theory." The book's analysis of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economic characteristics of modern China, the analysis of the emergence and development of national capitalist economics, and the analysis of the nature and role of commercial capital and usury capital are all of considerable theoretical depth. It is particularly worth noting that the author, with a firm stance, clear distinctions, and conclusive historical facts, strongly condemns imperialism's aggression against China, lashes out at feudalism's obstruction of economic development, and exposes the plundering of the people by bureaucratic capitalism. At the same time, it explains the necessity and great victory of the people's democratic revolution led by the Communist Party of China, and why China could not follow the capitalist path. Thus, readers not only gain economic history knowledge from the book but also receive practical patriotism and socialist ideological education. In the context of recent years when bourgeois liberalization and ethnic nihilism have been rampant, the author's ability to write such a work is commendable.

The book appropriately selects materials, neither overly detailed nor overly simplified. In terms of writing methods, it combines narrative and commentary, providing both general statistical data and typical materials. In several important aspects, such as the economy of the rear areas during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the hyperinflation during the Kuomintang rule, and the activities of the Resources Commission, it has absorbed the latest research findings from academia or used the latest and more accurate materials. These are the strengths of this economic history work.

The book also has some noticeable shortcomings. The main issue is the lack of innovation in its framework and system. I believe that if there were more deliberate innovation in chapter layout, material selection, and narrative methods, the work would have greater readability and attract more readers. In terms of content, there is more discussion on the economic policies of revolutionary base areas and less on economic conditions. Issues such as trade between liberated areas and Kuomintang-controlled areas, and experiences in taking over major cities after liberation, have not received due attention. There are also some statements that need further consideration, such as the first chapter "The Semi-Colonial and Semi-Feudal Transformation of Chinese Society (1840-1894)," where the term "transformation" seems to imply "beginning." Additionally, regarding the "land tax reform" implemented in the early Qing Dynasty, the author only sees its progressive significance in weakening the feudal state's direct control over the people, without considering its negative impact on population growth. The discussion on the economy of ethnic minorities and minority regions is still somewhat thin and rough.

　　《简明中国近代经济史》评介
　　王梦奎
    新近由中央民族学院出版社出版的况浩林著《简明中国近代经济史》，是一部颇具特色的经济史著作，也是一部比较好的经济史教材。
    这本书的最大特点，是比较系统地阐述了中国近代少数民族和少数民族地区的经济。我国是一个多民族国家，虽然少数民族人口占全国总人口不到10％，但据1982年人口普查，其绝对数有6700余万人，分布地区很广，约占全国国土面积的60％。少数民族地区经济史是中国近代经济史的不可缺少的重要组成部分。以往近代经济史研究的一大缺憾，就是经济发达地区、汉族经济研究多，而经济落后地区、少数民族经济研究少。况著对少数民族和少数民族地区经济作了比较系统的阐述，并把它作为我国近代经济史的一个有机组成部分进行研究。全书十二章，除第九章集中讲少数民族经济外，另有四章立有专讲少数民族经济的节，其余章节也有论及少数民族经济的。这当使读者了解在旧中国还有一个比常人所知的更为复杂也更为落后的广袤的世界，尽管这种研究还是初步的，但其开拓之功应该肯定。
    “史”和“论”结合得比较好，是这本书的又一个特点。“史”和“论”的关系是史学界长期争论的问题。毫无疑问，作为史学的一个分支，经济史著作以经济史实立论，用史料来说明问题。这就要大量研究和援引史料，但研究的深入则有赖于正确的理论指导。本书既掌握必要的史料，又具有扎实的理论功底，从而实现了“史”和“论”的统一。本书关于近代中国半殖民地半封建经济特征的分析，关于民族资本主义经济产生和发展的分析，关于商业资本和高利贷资本性质和作用的分析，都是有一定理论深度的。特别值得指出的是，作者以坚定的立场，鲜明的爱憎，确凿的史实，强烈谴责了帝国主义对中国的侵略，鞭挞了封建主义对经济发展的阻碍，揭露了官僚资本主义对人民大众的掠夺；同时说明了中国共产党领导的人民民主革命的必然性及其伟大胜利，说明了中国何以不能走资本主义道路。这样，读者从书中得到的就不仅是经济史知识，而且是实实在在的爱国主义和社会主义的思想教育。在近年来资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥、民族虚无主义甚嚣尘上的情况下，作者能够写出这样的著作，是难能可贵的。
    选用资料适量，既不失之繁琐，又不过于简略。在撰写方法上夹叙夹议，既有概括性的统计资料，又有典型材料。在若干重要方面，如抗日战争时期的大后方经济，国民党统治时期的恶性通货膨胀以及资源委员会的活动等，都吸取了学术界最新的研究成果，或者选用了最新的和比较准确的资料。这些都是这本经济史著作的优点。
    这本书也有比较明显的不足之处。主要是框架和体系缺乏创新。我想，如果能够在篇章布局、资料剪栽和叙述方法上刻意创新，使作品增加可读性，一定会吸引更多的读者。在内容上，对于革命根据地经济政策讲得多，经济状况讲得少；对于诸如解放区同国民党统治区的贸易、解放初接管大城市的经验等问题，未能给予应有的注意。也有某些提法值得推敲，如第一篇“中国社会经济的半殖民地半封建化（1840—1894年）”，这里的“化”，似乎应该是“开始”。又如对清初所行“摊丁入亩”制度，作者只看到其削弱封建国家对人民直接控制的进步意义，未能顾及其刺激人口膨胀的消极影响。对于少数民族和少数民族地区经济的论述，还显得有些单薄粗疏。
