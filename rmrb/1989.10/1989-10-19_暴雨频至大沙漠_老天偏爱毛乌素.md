Frequent heavy rain in the desert: The heavens favor the Mu Us

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hohhot, October 18th (reporter Lin Guangzhi), female meteorological engineer He Qin, after many years of investigation into the Mu Us Desert, discovered that the heavens favor this 40,000 square kilometer desert. The number of days with heavy rain, the maximum daily rainfall, and the annual average rainfall all rank first among the world's deserts, making it a rare place for heavy rain to fall in the desert.

The Mu Us Desert spans parts of Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Ningxia. According to records, from 1959 to 1980, over 22 years, the total number of days with heavy rain in Wushen Banner was 20, with an average of 0.9 days of heavy rain per year. Wushen Temple had a total of 16 days with heavy rain, with an average of 0.7 days of heavy rain per year. Existing data show that during this period, heavy rain occurred only a few times or not at all in other deserts in China and around the world.

He Qin believes that it is the unique rainfall conditions that have shaped the unique landscape of the Mu Us Desert.

    暴雨频至大沙漠  老天偏爱毛乌素
    据新华社呼和浩特10月18日电　（记者凌广志）女气象工程师贺勤经过对毛乌素沙漠的多年考察，发现老天偏爱于这片4万平方公里的沙漠，所降暴雨日数、日最大降水量及年平均降水量，均居世界各沙漠的首位，成为罕见的沙漠暴雨降落地。
    毛乌素沙漠地跨内蒙古、陕西及宁夏等省区的部分地域。据资料记载，自1959到1980年的22年间，乌审旗暴雨总日数为20次，年平均暴雨日数为0.9次。乌审召暴雨总日数为16次，年平均暴雨日数为0.7次。已有的资料表明，在这期间，中国和世界其他沙漠中，暴雨仅有数次或没有。
    贺勤认为，是得天独厚的降水条件造就了毛乌素沙漠独特的景观。
