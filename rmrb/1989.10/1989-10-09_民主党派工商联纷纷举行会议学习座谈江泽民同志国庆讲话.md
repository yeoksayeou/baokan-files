Various central committees of the democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have recently held meetings to study and discuss Jiang Zemin's speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Members of the parties unanimously agreed that Jiang Zemin's speech scientifically summarized the experiences of the past 40 years since the founding of New China, especially the past decade, and pointed out the direction and tasks for the people of the entire nation in the coming period. It is a programmatic document guiding the current work of the entire nation.

The central committees of the various democratic parties require all levels of organizations and all members to seriously study and deeply understand Jiang Zemin's important speech, to unite everyone's thoughts with the spirit of the speech, to invigorate the spirit, and to work together to make new contributions to achieving greater victories in the cause of socialist modernization and reform.

Members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL) noted during their study that Jiang Zemin's speech emphasized the significance of the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party for the cause of socialism and national reunification, and proposed measures and guarantees to improve this system. This is of great significance. As a member of the multi-party cooperation system led by the Communist Party, the CDL will continue to strive to enrich and improve the multi-party cooperation system led by the Communist Party, and contribute to the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law.

Chairman Sun Qimeng of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) and others discussed that the four basic conclusions expounded by Jiang Zemin in his speech are the Communist Party of China's profound summary of the historical experience since the founding of the nation. Looking back at the past, we further realize that the construction of China must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party of China and must adhere to the socialist road. This is the only correct path. We firmly oppose the idea of "complete Westernization" and taking the capitalist road.

The Central Committee of the China Democratic League of Self-Employed (CDLSE) recently held a chairman's meeting to focus on studying and discussing Jiang Zemin's speech. The meeting required that all levels of CDLSE organizations, when studying Jiang Zemin's speech, should not only connect it with China's reform and construction, and with the actual situation of the region, but also with the actual situation of CDLSE's work and the thoughts of its members, so that the thoughts of CDLSE and its broad membership can truly be united with the line, principles, and policies of the Communist Party.

During the study at the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, Chairman Zhou Peiyuan said that Jiang Zemin's speech summarized the past and looked forward to the future. It is a programmatic document guiding the people of the entire nation to unite their thoughts and steadfastly follow the socialist road. As a democratic party mainly composed of high-level intellectuals in the scientific and technological community, the Jiusan Society should seriously study the spirit of the speech, improve ideological awareness, further mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad membership, and contribute more to strengthening and improving socialist democracy and the rule of law, and to the economic construction and scientific and technological development of the country.

During the discussion at the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Vice Chairmen Li Ding, Sun Fuling, and Huang Liangchen all spoke, believing that Jiang Zemin's speech is a programmatic and directional document, which has important guiding significance for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce recently also issued a notice to various places, proposing that Jiang Zemin reiterated in his speech that the policy of rectification and reform must be firmly adhered to. The Federation of Industry and Commerce, as a united front organization and a domestic and foreign chamber of commerce, should play an active role in rectification and reform. It is necessary to guide the enthusiasm and initiative of the members in their studies to the track of serving the country's economic construction, to unite as one, to work hard, and to do a more solid job in various aspects.

Leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), the China Zhi Gong Party, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDL) especially pointed out during their study that Jiang Zemin proposed in his speech that there are ten important issues that need special attention in the current work of the Party and the state, which have strong pertinence. They not only clarify the current confusion in some major political policies, systemic reforms, and theories, but also point out the direction for the advancement of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is an important basis for our work. In connection with the actual situation of various parties, everyone also put forward opinions and suggestions on how to improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, how to exert the functions of the parties and democratic supervision, how to assist the Party and the government in doing a good job in rectification and reform, and achieving the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party, and how to strengthen their own ideological construction and improve their Marxist-Leninist theoretical level.

    新华社北京10月8日电　各民主党派中央、全国工商联近日来纷纷举行会议，学习座谈江泽民同志在庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年大会上的讲话。各党派同志一致认为，江泽民同志的讲话科学地总结了新中国成立40年来特别是近十年来的经验，指明了今后一个时期全国人民前进的方向和面临的任务，是指导当前全国各项工作的纲领性文件。
    各民主党派中央要求各级组织和全体成员认真学习和深入领会江泽民同志的重要讲话，把大家的思想认识统一到讲话的精神上来，振奋精神，同心协力，为夺取社会主义现代化建设和改革事业的更大胜利作出新的贡献。
    民盟中央的同志在学习中认为，江泽民同志在讲话中指出了实行共产党领导的为社会主义事业和祖国统一大业共同奋斗的多党合作与政治协商制度的意义，提出完善这一制度的措施和保证，意义重大。民盟作为共产党领导的多党合作制中的一个成员，将沿着这一方向，继续努力充实和完善共产党领导的多党合作制，为社会主义民主和法制建设贡献力量。 
    民建中央主席孙起孟等在讨论中认为，江泽民同志在讲话中阐述的四条基本结论，是中国共产党对建国以来历史经验的深刻总结。回首往事，我们进一步体会到，中国的建设事业必须坚持中国共产党的领导，必须坚持社会主义道路，这是唯一的正确之路。搞“全盘西化”、走资本主义道路，中国人民是坚决反对的。
    民进中央近日召开主席会议着重学习讨论了江泽民同志的讲话。会议要求民进各级组织在学习江泽民同志讲话时，不仅要联系我国改革和建设的实际，联系本地区的实际，也要联系民进会的会务实际和会员的思想实际，使民进和广大会员的思想真正统一到中共的路线、方针、政策上来。
    在九三学社中央的学习中，周培源主席说，江泽民总书记的讲话总结了过去，展望了未来，是指导全国人民统一思想，坚定不移地走社会主义道路的纲领性文献。九三学社作为一个以科技界中高级知识分子为主体的民主党派，要认真学习讲话精神，提高思想认识，进一步调动广大社员的积极性，为加强和完善社会主义的民主和法制，为国家的经济建设和科技发展多作贡献。
    在全国工商联的讨论中，李定、孙孚凌、黄凉尘等副主席纷纷发言，他们认为，江泽民同志的讲话是一个纲领性、方向性的文件，对于建设有中国特色的社会主义有重要的指导意义。
    全国工商联近日还向各地发出通知，提出江泽民同志在讲话中重申，必须坚定不移地继续贯彻治理整顿、深化改革的方针，工商联作为统一战线组织和对内对外的民间商会，要在治理整顿中发挥积极作用。要注意把会员在学习中焕发的热情和积极性引导到为国家经济建设服务的轨道上来，团结一致，艰苦奋斗，更加扎扎实实地做好各项工作。
    民革、致公、农工、台盟等党派领导同志在学习中特别提出，江泽民同志在讲话中提出当前党和国家工作中需要特别注意统一认识的十个重要问题，有很强的针对性，既澄清了当前在一些重大政治方针、体制改革以及理论上的模糊认识，也指明了有中国特色的社会主义事业的前进方向，是我们做好工作的重要依据。联系各党派的实际，大家还就如何完善共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度，发挥政党职能和民主监督作用，如何协助党和政府搞好治理整顿、深化改革，实现中共十三届四中全会提出的4件大事，如何加强自身思想建设，提高马列主义基本理论的修养等问题提出了意见和建议。
