Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 7th.

To promote the commercialization of scientific and technological achievements, China will provide preferential policies to support the trial production of 3,582 new products.

The 3,582 new products included in the 1989 national-level new product trial production plan consist of 2,395 items arranged by the State Planning Commission and 1,187 items arranged by the State Science and Technology Commission. Over 90% of these new products are production materials, with the remainder being consumer goods. Deeply processed products are more than twice the number of primary products, and products that can replace imports and generate foreign exchange earnings account for about half of all new products. Among the new products arranged for trial production, 50% have reached international standards, and the rest are at the domestic advanced level.

China began compiling and implementing the national-level new product trial production plan starting last year.
