The Carpathian Mountains, which stretch across Romania, boast a majestic presence and grandeur that can rival Europe's most famous Alps. The Romanian people proudly regard them as a national symbol and a source of national pride. During our brief stay in Romania, we had the fortunate opportunity to ascend the Carpathian Mountains twice. The first time was in Brașov, where we took a cable car to enjoy the panoramic view. The second time was in the town of Câmpulung near Argeș County, where we rode a Romanian-made "Aro" off-road vehicle to the mountain top for a test drive. Compared to the first ascent, the latter was more memorable because it involved a thrilling and daring adventure that embodied the spirit of progress and innovation.

When we visited the "Aro" Automobile Factory in Romania and saw the newly produced, sleek, and various models of off-road vehicles, we inquired in detail about their technical specifications, quality standards, and manufacturing processes. Comrade Zēng Kūn from our delegation, with the host's permission, even got into the driver's seat and started the engine. The technical manager, Mr. Sampson, did not mind our actions; instead, he arranged for us to witness a test drive.

What we did not expect was that the test drive would take place on the Carpathian Mountains. We first traveled in a car along the winding mountain roads for a while, stopping at the foot of a mountain, and then switched to the "Aro" off-road vehicle, climbing a slope of over 30 degrees to reach the top of a hill. From the high vantage point, we saw the rolling mountains nestled among lush beech and pine forests; the lower slopes were devoid of trees but covered with soft green grass, appearing as if meticulously manicured. Not far away, in the valley between the mountains, was the source of the Argeș River, which flows into the Dâmbovița River; the high mountain streams flowed endlessly. Looking around, the mountains were bathed in sunlight, and beauty was everywhere. Four "Aro" off-road vehicles of types 4, 10, 24, and 241 maneuvered effortlessly up and down the slopes, as if on flat ground. As we applauded the spectacular performance, I jokingly pointed to a steep cliff on the left side, several hundred meters high with a 45-degree incline, and asked, "Can these cars climb up there?" A factory representative, understanding my question, waved his hand, and the four "Aro" vehicles quickly ascended the steep slope in single file, not spiraling but going straight up and down. The impact force caused the vehicles to almost stand upright. The cars seemed to be competing with each other: one turned halfway up the mountain, another reversed from the bottom to the top, and another performed intricate maneuvers, making the onlookers dizzy with excitement. Yet, the drivers remained calm and confident. According to our Romanian friends, these off-road vehicles are not only robust, powerful, stable, and suitable for various complex terrains but also aesthetically pleasing, lightweight, and fuel-efficient. They have won multiple awards in international off-road vehicle competitions.

However, the "Aro" Off-Road Vehicle Factory's ability to produce such high-quality cars is indeed remarkable. 104 years ago, the site was a small paper mill. After several transformations, it was converted into an automobile manufacturing plant. In 1956, it produced its first car engine, and in 1957, it produced its first off-road vehicle. After years of hard work and technological upgrades, it has grown into a modern, large-scale enterprise covering 80 hectares, employing 12,000 workers, and producing 25,000 vehicles annually.

The factory's development strategy is to target the international market. Specifically, it focuses on training and cultivating talent, combining technological innovation with the introduction, digestion, and absorption of advanced foreign technologies, and always considering the needs of its customers. Due to its rapid transformation and diversification, the factory's products have been long-term exports to countries like China, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and more. It has also entered many developed capitalist countries such as the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal. Additionally, the "Aro" Automobile Factory has installed three production lines in Italy, Portugal, and Peru, producing and selling locally. Another successful aspect of the factory's operations is that it arranges production based on orders, avoiding product backlogs, accelerating capital turnover, and partially meeting customers' special needs. For example, some customers prefer the steering wheel on the left, while others prefer it on the right; some want air conditioning, while others want brake assist systems. Although these services add complexity, they help attract more customers.

Facing the intense competition in today's global automobile market, the "Aro" Automobile Factory does not rest on its laurels. The entire workforce is striving to keep up with the latest trends in the global automobile industry. While introducing Italian car-making technology, they are currently designing a new series of engines and cylinders and upgrading the transmission and steering systems. Additionally, next year, the factory will build a new painting workshop to enhance the cars' corrosion resistance and shine. In summary, the goal is to increase speed, reduce fuel consumption, add functions, and improve the appearance, making the "Aro" brand cars more modern from the inside out.

It is evident that the choice of the Carpathian Mountains as the test drive location, with its high-intensity climbing, symbolizes a new level of achievement.

### 登喀尔巴阡山观试车

    登喀尔巴阡山观试车
    本报记者　顾玉清
    横亘罗马尼亚境内的喀尔巴阡山，其巍巍雄姿、磅礴气势可与欧洲最著名的阿尔卑斯山相媲美。罗马尼亚人无不自豪地把它视为国家的象征和民族的骄傲。我们在罗马尼亚逗留的短暂日子里能够有机会两登喀尔巴阡山，无疑是件很幸运的事。第一次是在布拉索夫乘缆车凌空揽胜。第二次是在阿尔杰什县的肯布龙市附近坐罗马尼亚国产“阿罗”牌越野车登山顶观试车。相比之下，后一次登攀更使人难忘，因为在那激烈、惊险的运动中包含了进取与创造。
    当我们在罗马尼亚“阿罗”汽车制造厂参观，看到刚刚出厂的一辆辆新颖、美观、不同型号的越野车时，详细地询问了它的技术性能、质量标准、工艺水平等。代表团的曾坤同志在征得主人的同意后，甚至登上驾驶室点火发动。负责介绍情况的技术经理桑普森对我们的举动非但没有反感，相反给我们安排了一次试车表演。
    没有想到的是，试车场就设在喀尔巴阡山上。我们先乘汽车在弯弯曲曲的山间小道颠簸行驶了一段，停在一座山脚下，然后换乘“阿罗”越野车，沿着30多度的高坡噌、噌、噌地爬上了一个山头。登高望远，呈现在我们面前的是连绵起伏的山峦静卧在郁郁葱葱的山毛榉和松林之上；从低山坡往上则没有一棵树，却长满了茸茸绿草，看上去如同人工修剪过一般；对面不远的山间，是与登博维察河相通的阿尔杰什河的发源地，那里高山流水不断；举目四顾，山上山下，阳光满地，秀色处处。四辆“阿罗”4型、10型、24型和241型越野车就在这里上下翻越，停走自如、形同平地。大家在为那精彩表演鼓掌的时候，我指着左侧一座好几百米高，约有45度陡坡的挺拔山岭开了句玩笑：“从那儿能上得去吗？”该厂的一位陪同听懂了我的意思后，挥了挥手，四辆“阿罗”车很快从那陡坡鱼贯而上，没有盘旋而是直上直下。由于有股冲击力，车身都快要立起来似的。车与车之间又好像在进行一场比赛：有的行至半山腰时突然来个转弯，有的从山下向山顶开倒车，有的在进行穿插花样行驶，让人看了眼花缭乱，真觉得悬。可是驾驶员们却稳稳当当，充满自信。据罗马尼亚朋友介绍，这种越野车既有坚固耐用、马力大、稳定性好和适合各种复杂路面行驶的性能，又具备美观、轻便、省油等特点，曾在多次国际越野车比赛中获奖。
    然而，“阿罗”越野车厂能生产出如此水平的汽车确是件了不起的事。104年以前，那里曾是一个小型造纸厂。几经变迁后，人们才把它改造成汽车制造厂。1956年，它生产出了第一台汽车发动机，1957年生产了第一辆越野车。经过若干年的艰苦创业和技术改造，今天它已发展成为占地面积为80公顷，职工人数达12000名，年产汽车已达25000辆的较现代化大型企业。
    该厂的发展战略是目标国际市场。具体做法是：重视训练和培养人才；坚持把技术创新与研究、引进、消化国外先进技术相结合；想方设法为用户着想。由于转型快和多样化，该厂产品不仅长期销往中国、匈牙利、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克等国家，而且打入了不少发达的资本主义国家，如英国、法国、意大利、西班牙、希腊、葡萄牙等。另外，目前“阿罗”汽车厂还在意大利、葡萄牙和秘鲁安装了三条生产线，就地生产，就地销售。该厂在经营方面的又一成功之处就是，全年产量根据订货来安排生产。这样就不会存在产品积压问题，加快了资金周转，且又可以部分地满足顾客的特殊需要。比如，有的要把方向盘放左、有的则要放右；有的要安装空调，有的则要安装助刹车设备。此项服务虽然增添了不少麻烦，但它可以赢得更多的顾客。
    面对当今世界汽车市场强手如林，竞争日趋激烈的形势，“阿罗”汽车厂没有陶醉于已取得的成就，全厂职工正在为紧追世界汽车新潮流而努力。他们在引进意大利造车技术的同时，目前已在着手设计一组新型发动机和汽缸，并对传动和方向机制进行改造。此外，明年该厂将建造一个新的喷漆车间，以便让汽车表面的耐腐蚀性，发光发亮等优点表现得更突出。总之，就是千方百计提高速度、减少油耗、增加功能、改变外观，使“阿罗”牌汽车从里到外更富有时代感。
    可见，主人选择喀尔巴阡山为试车场，有意识地进行高强度的攀登，这实际上已经预示着一种新的超越。
