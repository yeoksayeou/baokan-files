Calculating the Use of Land

	Calculating how to live, the days may not necessarily be spent very frugally, because even if it's the same accounting, there is still the question of how to calculate. How can we calculate the use of our land so that not even a single inch is wasted? We hope to see more good experiences.

	Occupying more land, a household with a bit, a hundred households with many; a year with a bit, ten years with many. Over the years, our country's land, especially arable land, has been continuously decreasing at an alarming rate. The main reason for this rapid and significant reduction is that everyone takes a little bit. The multiplicands are just a few cents, a few tenths, or a few mu, but the multipliers are in the thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of millions. When these two are multiplied together, the numbers become astonishingly large, making it difficult to reverse the trend.

　　算计着用土地
    算计着过日子，日子也不一定就过得很节省，因为同是算账，还有一个怎么算法的问题。怎样算计着使用我们的土地，不让有一分一厘的浪费？希望有更多的好经验。
    多占土地，一户一点，百户许多；一年一点，十年许多。多年来，我国的土地特别是耕地不断锐减，减得这么快，这么多，主要是你占一点、我占一点造成的。被乘数都是几厘、几分、几亩，乘数则是几千、几万、上亿，两者相乘，数字就大得令人吃惊，以至“积”重而难返。
