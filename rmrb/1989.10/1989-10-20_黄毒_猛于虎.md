Only watching a few dozen minutes of pornographic videos made me addicted. This was the confession of the condemned criminal, Lan Jiren. He was a young man from a peasant family and had no prior criminal record. However, he fell victim to "yellow poison," using extremely brutal methods to rape young girls, committing a capital offense, and was executed according to the law.

This case is thought-provoking.

Lan Jiren's case is not an isolated incident. In recent years, publications and audio-visual products that promote obscenity, feudal superstition, and violent crime have flooded the market, polluting the social atmosphere and harming the people, with serious consequences. Especially for those young people who are inexperienced and have weak resistance, the harm is even greater. A single bad book or a bad video tape can negate years of painstaking positive education by leaders, teachers, and parents. The harm of "yellow poison" is more ferocious than tigers, and more and more people are recognizing its severity. "Cleaning up yellow" has become a strong demand from all sectors of society.

Some people in society, for the sake of money or other despicable purposes, are spreading and trafficking in "yellow" materials. Foreign hostile forces are also using cultural garbage and spiritual drugs to sedate our people. In the past few years, we have not paid enough attention to this serious situation and have not struck hard enough, allowing "yellow poison" to spread and ruin many people.

Lan Jiren was devoured by the rampant "yellow poison" and was a victim of it. For those who commit crimes because of "yellow poison," it is undoubtedly necessary to strike them down firmly according to the law. However, to eradicate the harm, it is more important to investigate and block the sources of "yellow" materials. This time, the published cases include both severe punishments and lenient treatments. Currently, the country is vigorously and practically carrying out the "cleanup yellow" work. We must eradicate evil thoroughly and strictly follow policies. Let us work together to grasp and implement this work tightly, to protect the healthy growth of young people and maintain the normal order of society.

### “黄毒”猛于虎

    “黄毒”猛于虎
    “只看几十分钟的黄色录像，就使我上了瘾”，这是死刑犯蓝继仁的交代。他是一个出身于农民家庭的青年，原来并无“前科”。可是，他中了“黄毒”，用极其残忍的手段奸淫幼女，犯了死罪，被依法处决。
    这个案例，发人深思。
    蓝继仁的案例并不是个别的。近几年，宣扬淫秽色情封建迷信和凶杀暴力的书报刊和音像制品充斥市场，污染社会空气，毒害人民，造成了严重的后果。特别是对那些涉世不深、免疫力不强的青少年，毒害更大。一本坏书、一盘坏录像带的坏作用，甚至可以使领导、老师、家长多年苦口婆心的正面教育化为泡影。“黄毒”猛于虎，其为害之烈已为越来越多的人所认识。“扫黄”已成为社会各界人士的强烈要求。
    社会上有些伤天害理的人为了赚钱或其它卑鄙的目的，大肆“造黄”、“贩黄”，国外敌对势力也利用文化垃圾、精神毒品来麻醉我们的人民。对于这种严重的情势，前几年我们重视不够，打击不力，以至“黄毒”泛滥，毁掉了不少人。
    蓝继仁是被泛滥的“黄毒”吞噬的，是“黄毒”的牺牲品。对于像他这样因中“黄毒”而犯罪的坏人，毫无疑问，必须依法坚决打击。但是，除害要除根，更重要的是必须查“黄源”、堵“黄源”。这次公布的案例有严惩的，也有从宽的。当前全国正在轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实地进行“扫黄”工作，要除恶务尽，又要严格按政策办事。让我们共同努力，把这项工作抓紧抓实，以保护青少年的健康成长，维护社会的正常秩序。
