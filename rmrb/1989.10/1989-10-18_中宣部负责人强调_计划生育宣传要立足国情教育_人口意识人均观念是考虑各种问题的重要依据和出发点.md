In today's closing ceremony of the national family planning propaganda work symposium jointly held by the Propaganda Department and the State Family Planning Commission, Propaganda Department Deputy Director Xu Weicheng emphasized: In the entire propaganda work, the propaganda of basic national conditions should be permeated throughout various aspects and periods of propaganda work, especially the population consciousness and per capita concept, which should become an important basis and starting point for us to consider various issues and conduct various forms of education. Various levels of party committee propaganda departments should elevate family planning propaganda to the level of basic national conditions and basic national policy education, and include it in the important agenda.

Xu Weicheng said that family planning propaganda must firmly grasp the key link of national conditions education, and clearly explain the basic national conditions. The most basic condition of our country is that we have a large population, a weak foundation, and relatively scarce per capita arable land and resources. We must clearly explain the obvious contradictions between the rapid population growth and natural resources and economic development, so that people can strengthen their per capita consciousness and realize the severity of the population situation; and we must combine the long-term social and economic development plan of our country, clearly explain the objective requirements of the population growth for the realization of the national set goals; we must also widely publicize the remarkable achievements and huge benefits of China's family planning work; so that cadres and the masses can understand the national difficulties and voluntarily share the burden.

Xu Weicheng said that family planning is a work that benefits the people, and family planning propaganda must embody the spirit of serving the people everywhere. To make the principles and requirements of family planning understood and accepted, it is also necessary to combine propaganda with service, and integrate propaganda into service. This is a work guideline that we should always remember and follow in conducting family planning propaganda.

Xu Weicheng suggested that in the future, family planning propaganda should be included in the activities of building civilized units, civilized villages and towns, and civilized families. When conducting selection and commendation, the right of veto should be implemented for family planning work. Those who do not meet the family planning indicators shall not enjoy the title of civilization. Party member education and party school teaching should also include the content of population theory and family planning policy.

When talking about the role of party members in family planning, Xu Weicheng said that at present, there are indeed a few party members and cadres who disregard party discipline and laws, and some even use their power for personal gain and falsify information. It is understood that among the party members who have been disciplined by the party, those who have been disciplined for violating family planning policies rank third, just after economic crimes and sexual offenses. This shows that some party organizations are not strict enough in education and supervision in this regard, and this situation should be changed quickly to ensure that party members take the lead in implementing the basic national policy.

    中宣部负责人强调
    计划生育宣传要立足国情教育
    人口意识人均观念是考虑各种问题的重要依据和出发点
    本报杭州10月17日电　记者艾笑报道：在今天闭幕的中宣部和国家计生委联合召开的全国计划生育宣传工作座谈会上，中宣部常务副部长徐惟诚强调：在整个宣传工作中，基本国情的宣传应当贯穿渗透到各个方面、各个时期的宣传工作中去，特别是人口意识、人均观念，应当成为我们考虑各种问题、进行各项教育的一个重要依据和出发点。各级党委宣传部门要把计划生育宣传提到基本国情和基本国策教育的高度，列入重要议程。
    徐惟诚说，计划生育宣传必须紧紧地抓住国情教育这个关键环节，把基本国情讲清讲透。我国国情最基本的一条就是人口多、底子薄、人均耕地和资源相对短缺。讲清我国人口过快增长与自然资源和经济发展之间存在的明显矛盾，使人们强化人均意识，认清人口形势的严峻性；并要结合我国的社会经济发展远景规划，讲清实现国家既定奋斗目标对人口增长的客观要求；还要广泛宣传我国计划生育工作取得的显著成就、巨大效益；使干部群众了解国家困难，自觉为国分忧。
    徐惟诚说，计划生育是一项为人民群众谋利益的工作，计划生育宣传更要处处体现为人民服务的精神。要使计划生育的道理和要求被理解、接受，还必须做到宣传与服务结合，寓宣传于服务中。这是我们进行计划生育宣传应当经常牢记和遵循的一条工作方针。
    徐惟诚建议，今后应把计划生育宣传纳入建设文明单位、文明村镇、文明家庭活动。进行评选和表彰时，要实行计划生育工作一票否决权，凡计划生育指标未达到的，不得享有文明称号。党员教育和党校教学，也应列入人口理论及计划生育政策的内容。
    在谈到党员应在计划生育中起模范作用时，徐惟诚说，目前，确有少数党员和干部无视党纪和法律，有的甚至以权谋私、弄虚作假。据了解，在全党受党纪处分的党员中，因违犯计划生育政策而受处分的，仅次于经济犯罪和性罪错，已占到第三位。这说明一些党组织在这方面对党员教育不够、监督不力，这种状况应该迅速改变，保证党员带头执行基本国策。
