How to develop highway transportation to meet the needs of the national economy has been a topic of discussion for many years. Some aspects have been incorporated into the state's technical policies, but the issue has not been fully resolved. In this regard, I believe that we must first change some of the incorrect views and practices regarding highway traffic from the past.

First, unify our thinking. For a long time, there has been an erroneous notion in national economic planning that prioritizes production over circulation and industry over transportation. As a result, the vanguard cannot lead the way. Particularly, highway transportation has long been considered to serve only short-distance collection and distribution functions, belonging to local transportation, and is not prioritized in national planning. Consequently, it does not receive equal treatment in terms of investment, material supply, and tax policies, nor does it receive additional preferential treatment. Some people even mistakenly believe that the modernization of highway traffic is merely a luxury for high-consumption enjoyment of small cars. The debate over the development of highway transportation has been ongoing for nearly 20 years. This endless debate has seriously affected the development of China's automobile industry and automobile transportation industry, and has caused the country significant economic losses. It is time for us to unify our thinking, make a firm decision to adjust the proportion of transportation with other industries, and adjust the structure of transportation itself. Otherwise, we will continue to miss opportunities and hinder the development of China's society and economy.

Second, seriously implement the policy of investment tilt. Over the years, the state has repeatedly emphasized the need to adjust the industrial structure and transportation structure, but the investment ratio structure has not been adjusted, and the so-called "old lines cannot be moved." Therefore, it is as if there has been no adjustment, and highway construction investment still does not have an account. Although some measures have been taken to raise funds from other channels, these are not capital construction investments, and all channels for materials, equipment, etc., are not open, making it difficult to proceed. The state not only does not provide funds but also levies "one tax and two funds" on the funds raised. I hope that, based on the unification of thinking, we will seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's recent speech, which emphasizes that we should even take on debt to strengthen investment in basic industries. We should make a firm decision to increase the proportion of investment in the entire transportation industry and include highway construction in the account.

Third, in terms of material supply and tax policies, more preferential policies should be implemented for highway construction and automobile transportation. Currently, due to the lack of national investment accounts for highway traffic, funds are raised through other channels, and thus national preferential policies cannot be enjoyed. Highway traffic involves thousands of households, and its social benefits far exceed its economic benefits. I hope that the national decision-making departments will quickly solve this problem and accelerate the modernization of highway construction.

### 正确对待公路交通

　　正确对待公路交通
　　中国公路学会副理事长、高级工程师　刘以成
    如何发展公路汽车运输，以适应国民经济的发展，这一问题已经议论多年，有些也已纳入国家的技术政策，但迄今未能彻底解决。对此，个人认为首先必须改变过去对公路交通的一些不正确看法和做法。
    一、统一思想。长期以来，在国民经济计划中存在着重生产轻流通、重工业轻交通的错误观念，因而导致先行官不能先行。尤其公路汽车运输一直被认为只起短途集散作用，属于地方交通，在国家计划中排不上队，从而在投资、物资供应、税收政策等方面不能享受与兄弟部门同等的待遇，更得不到进一步的优惠。一些人甚至片面地认为公路交通的现代化似乎只是为了小汽车高消费享受的一种奢侈品。对公路运输的发展问题，已经争论了近20年，这种无休止的争论，已经严重地影响了我国汽车工业及汽车运输业的发展，并给国家带来了巨大的经济损失。现在是我们统一思想，痛下决心调整交通与其他行业的比例，调整运输本身的结构的时候了。否则将继续贻误战机，阻碍我国社会、经济的发展。
    二、认真贯彻投资倾斜的政策。多年来，国家多次强调要调整产业结构、调整运输结构，但是国家的投资比例结构却不调整，所谓“老线不能动”。因此等于没有调整，公路建设投资仍是连户头也没有。虽也采取了一些措施，从其他途径筹集一些资金，但非基建投资，一切物资、设备等渠道却不通，仍是困难重重，步履维艰。国家不但不给钱相反地还在这些筹集的资金中倒征收“一税两基金”。希望在统一思想的基础上，认真贯彻邓小平同志在最近讲话中提出的宁肯欠债，也要加强基础工业的投资等指示精神，痛下决心，加大整个交通运输投资的比例，把公路建设列入户头。
    三、在物资供应与税收政策等方面对公路建设和汽车运输实行更多的优惠政策。目前由于公路交通没有国家投资户头，采取其他渠道集资，因而享受不到国家的优惠政策。公路交通涉及到千家万户，其社会效益远大于本身的经济效益，希望国家决策部门尽快解决这一问题，加快现代化公路建设。
