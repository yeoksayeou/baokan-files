Original Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Tuohuti Shabier used his position to support illegal trading activities and accepted bribes totaling 15,842 yuan, constituting the crime of accepting bribes. Given his confession of all crimes and the return of all illicit gains and items, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Procuratorate has decided to drop the charges against him.

On September 13, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Procuratorate initiated an investigation into Tuohuti Shabier's bribery case. The investigation revealed that on March 28 and June 30, 1988, during a period when chemical fertilizers were scarce and railway transportation was tight, Tuohuti Shabier, using his authority over industrial and commercial work, made phone calls and wrote notes to help a woman named Cheng, who was engaged in illegal business activities, secure 100 tons of chemical fertilizers and 8 mechanical refrigerated railcars. Cheng then resold the fertilizers at a price of 120 yuan per ton and used the railcars to transport and resell Hami melons, earning a total profit of 190,000 yuan, with a net gain of 148,000 yuan. Tuohuti Shabier accepted 1,000 yuan in cash and over 4,800 yuan worth of goods from Cheng as bribes.

In May 1988, Tuohuti Shabier wrote a note to help a woman named Wang, who was on unpaid leave, secure 120 tons of aluminum ingots at a preferential price. Wang resold the aluminum ingots, making a profit of 82,000 yuan. Afterwards, Tuohuti Shabier accepted 10,000 yuan from Wang as a bribe.

Considering Tuohuti Shabier's voluntary confession and return of all illicit gains, as well as his evident remorse, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Procuratorate, in accordance with the law and the "Notice on the Requirement for Self-Surrender and Confession within a Time Limit for Those Who Commit Crimes of Embezzlement, Bribery, and Speculative Trading" issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, decided, after discussion by the procuratorial committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Procuratorate and approval by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, to drop the charges against Tuohuti Shabier.

    新华社乌鲁木齐10月22日电　原新疆维吾尔自治区副主席托乎提·沙比尔利用职权支持非法倒卖活动，收受贿赂15842元，已构成受贿罪。鉴于其能坦白全部罪行，退出全部赃款赃物，日前新疆维吾尔自治区人民检察院已对其作出免予起诉的决定。
    9月13日，新疆维吾尔自治区人民检察院依法对托乎提·沙比尔受贿问题立案侦查。现已查明，1988年3月28日、6月30日，在市场化肥紧缺、铁路运输紧张的情况下，托乎提·沙比尔利用主管工交工作的职务之便，先后打电话、批条子，为从事非法经营活动的妇女程某解决化肥100吨、机械保温车皮8节。程遂将这批化肥每吨加价120元转手倒卖，将车皮装满哈密瓜就地倒卖，两项合计获取暴利19万元，实得14.8万元。托乎提·沙比尔收受程某贿赂人民币1000元和4800余元的实物。
