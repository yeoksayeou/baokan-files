Zhengzhou City's Huanghe District Court recently held a public trial for the major arson case at the Zhengzhou Cigarette Factory.

On March 11th of this year, in the afternoon, Li Sujie, a female warehouse worker at the factory's color printing division, used an electric heater to boil water in the warehouse guardroom in violation of regulations. She did not unplug the heater after use. When she left for the day, she pushed the heater under an iron cabinet and closed the door. At around 6 PM, Liu Min, the female warehouse supervisor, went to the guardroom, turned on the switch, and turned on the lights. A few minutes later, when she left, she instructed a new worker to turn off the lights but did not pull down the switch to cut off the power. At this time, the heater had heated the iron cabinet red, igniting the clothes inside, causing the warehouse to burn down. The direct economic loss amounted to 7,378,900 yuan. The court sentenced Liu Min to three years in prison and Li Sujie to two years in prison for the crime of causing a major accident.
