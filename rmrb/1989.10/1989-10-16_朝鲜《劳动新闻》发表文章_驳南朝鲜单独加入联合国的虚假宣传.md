Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 12th.

North Korea's *Rodong Sinmun* today published an article refuting South Korea's propaganda regarding its unilateral membership in the United Nations.

According to reports, on September 28th, South Korea's radio station reported that the United Nations Secretary-General, during a meeting with South Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated that he would do his utmost to achieve South Korea's membership in the United Nations.

On October 3rd, the spokesperson for the United Nations Secretary-General in New York issued a statement pointing out that South Korea's report was false. The United Nations Secretary-General had not expressed any opinion on the issue of South Korea joining the United Nations.

The *Rodong Sinmun* article states that on the very day the United Nations Secretary-General's spokesperson refuted South Korea's false report, the South Korean authorities were still shouting about the "rationality of South Korea's unilateral membership in the United Nations"; that "the number of supporting countries is increasing"; that at next year's United Nations General Assembly, South Korea will submit an "application for temporary unilateral membership in the United Nations"; and that if the conditions for "unification" of North and South Korea are met, South Korea will withdraw from the United Nations and reapply with a "single national name." The article criticizes South Korea for using propaganda tools to spread false information in order to permanently divide Korea. The South Korean authorities' so-called "temporary membership in the United Nations" is essentially no different from permanent membership. In order to join the United Nations, the South Korean authorities are not above using the shoddy tactic of appropriating the names of United Nations officials and will inevitably face condemnation from United Nations member states.

    驳南朝鲜单独加入联合国的虚假宣传
    新华社平壤10月12日电  朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表文章，批驳南朝鲜舆论就有关南朝鲜单独加入联合国所进行的虚假宣传。
    据报道，南朝鲜电台9月28日报道说，联合国秘书长在会见南朝鲜外务部长官时表示，将尽全力实现南朝鲜加入联合国。
    10月3日，联合国秘书长的发言人在纽约发表谈话指出，南朝鲜的报道是虚假的。联合国秘书长没有就关于南朝鲜加入联合国的问题表明过自己的观点。
    《劳动新闻》的文章说，就在联合国秘书长的发言人反驳南朝鲜的虚假报道的当天，南朝鲜当局还在叫嚷南朝鲜“单独加入联合国的合理性”；“支持的国家正在增多”；在明年召开的联合国大会上，南朝鲜将提出“暂时单独加入联合国的申请”；如果朝鲜南北“统一的条件成熟”，南朝鲜将退出联合国，再以“单一的国号重新加入”。文章批评南朝鲜动用舆论工具进行虚假的宣传是为了永久分裂朝鲜。南朝鲜当局所说的“暂时加入联合国”，本质上与永久加入没有什么区别。南朝鲜当局为了加入联合国，不惜采取盗用联合国官员名义的拙劣作法，必将受到联合国成员国的谴责。
