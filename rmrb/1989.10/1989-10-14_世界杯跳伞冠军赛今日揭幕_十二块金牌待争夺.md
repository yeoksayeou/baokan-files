Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 13th.

The city of Chengdu, known as the "Land of Abundance," is hosting an international sporting event—the fifth World Cup Parachuting Championship.

This competition features 33 male and female athletes from 13 countries, including the Soviet Union, Italy, West Germany, East Germany, and China. The aerial contest will commence tomorrow and conclude on October 19th. Athletes will compete for 12 gold medals in the youth and adult categories for precision landing, freestyle, and all-around events. This event is co-sponsored by Italy and China and was decided upon at the 1981 International Parachuting Commission meeting as one of the world's two major precision and freestyle parachuting competitions.

According to local experts, the East German team is expected to have the highest level of competition. They secured 5 out of 6 gold medals in the third World Cup. The Soviet Union is another recognized world power. The Chinese team is also a formidable contender. Chen Hong, a member of the men's adult team, is an international-level parachutist who has participated in four World Championships. The youth team is also strong, with particular hopes placed on Yang Yi and Zhang Hongyan.

    十二块金牌待争夺
    据新华社成都10月13日电　（记者徐波、梁希仪）天府之都蓉城迎来国际体育赛事——第五届世界杯跳伞冠军赛。
    本次比赛有苏联、意大利、联邦德国、民主德国、中国等13个国家33名男女运动员参赛。这次空中较量将从明日开始，到本月19日结束，运动员们将争夺成年和青年组定点、特技和全能项目的12块金牌。这项赛事是由意大利和中国联合倡议，于1981年在国际跳伞委员会代表大会上决定的世界两大定点特技跳伞赛之一。
    据此间的行家们分析，这次比赛水平最高的是民主德国队，该队在第3届世界杯赛中获得总共6枚金牌中的5枚。苏联队是公认的世界强队之一。中国队也是一支有实力能竞争的队伍，男子成年组陈宏是国际级跳伞健将，曾参加过4次世界锦标赛，青年组实力亦强，尤其对杨翼和张红雁寄予厚望。
