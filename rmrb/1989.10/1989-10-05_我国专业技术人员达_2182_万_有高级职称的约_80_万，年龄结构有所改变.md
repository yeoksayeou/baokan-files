	China has 21.82 million professional and technical personnel, according to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Personnel. These personnel are divided into 29 series in the fields of natural sciences and social sciences: higher education, scientific research, health, engineering, agriculture, statistics, economics, accounting, translation, journalism, arts, archives, secondary school teachers, primary school teachers, vocational school teachers, secondary specialized school teachers, social science research, experimental personnel, broadcasters, publishing, books, cultural relics, lawyers, notaries, ships, pilots, sports coaches, customs, and industrial arts.

	Among them, 12.223 million professional and technical personnel work in public institutions, 8.188 million in enterprises, and 1.413 million in government agencies. Approximately 800,000 of these personnel hold senior professional titles, and 5 million hold intermediate titles.

	In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic in 1952, China had only 420,000 scientific and technical personnel. In 1977, the central government decided to restore technical titles and establish an evaluation system, implementing a technical post responsibility system. By the end of 1983, the country had only 5.95 million technical personnel with professional titles, including 94,000 senior professional technical personnel and 1.53 million with intermediate titles.

	In 1985, the Party Central Committee and the State Council decided to further reform the title evaluation work and implement a professional and technical post appointment system. When evaluating and appointing professional and technical posts, practices such as seniority and waiting for years were abandoned. Both qualifications, education, and experience were considered, with greater emphasis on job responsibilities and contributions. A large number of young talents emerged, and according to statistics from the State Education Commission and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the implementation of the professional and technical post appointment system has resulted in nearly 100 professors and researchers in their early 30s in these two departments; and more than 600 associate professors and associate researchers in their 20s and 30s. This has changed the situation where the age structure of China's senior professional and technical personnel was relatively high.

    我国专业技术人员达2182万
    有高级职称的约80万，年龄结构有所改变
    本报讯　记者王友恭最近从人事部获悉：据最新统计结果，全国现有专业技术人员2182万人，分为自然科学和社会科学领域共29个系列：高教、科研、卫生、工程、农业、统计、经济、会计、翻译、新闻、艺术、档案、中学教师、小学教师、技工学校教师、中专学校教师、社会科学研究、实验人员、播音员、出版、图书、文博、律师、公证、船舶、飞行员、体育教练、海关、工艺美术。其中，在事业单位的专业技术人员达1222.3万，在企业的达818.8万，在机关的达141.3万。这些专业技术人员中有高级职称的约80万人，有中级职称的共500万人。
    建国初期的1952年，我国仅有科学技术人员42万人。1977年，中央决定恢复技术职称，建立考核制度，实行技术岗位责任制。到1983年底，全国仅有具备专业技术职称的技术人员595万人，其中高级专业技术人员9.4万，中级职称的153万人。
    1985年，党中央、国务院决定进一步改革职称评定工作，推行专业技术职务聘任制。在评聘专业技术职务时，打破论资排辈、熬年头等做法，既看水平、学历和资历，更重岗位职责和贡献大小。大批有为青年也脱颖而出，仅据国家教委和中国科学院的统计，通过专业技术职务聘任制的实施，目前这两部门中已有年仅30多岁的教授、研究员近百人；20多岁到30多岁的副教授、副研究员600多人。这使我国高级专业技术队伍年龄结构偏高的情况有所改变。
