A reporter from Xinhua News Agency, upon returning from the 13th meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, visited Ke Zhaocai, the chief representative of the Chinese side.

Ke said, since the 12th meeting of the Joint Liaison Group, Sino-British relations and the situation in Hong Kong have undergone many changes. Before and after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, due to a lack of understanding of the facts and some erroneous reports or even rumors spread by the media, many people had doubts and misunderstandings, which is understandable. Our leaders have repeatedly stated that China's political situation is stable, the economy is developing, and our reform and opening-up policies, as well as the principles and policies formulated according to the "one country, two systems" concept for Hong Kong and Macau, will not change. Hong Kong and Macau compatriots can be completely assured. The important reason for the current confidence issue in Hong Kong is the irresponsible actions of the British side. The British side's unilateral announcement in June to suspend the work of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group has had negative consequences. A small number of people have used Hong Kong to engage in sabotage and attempt to overthrow the Chinese government, which has had a very detrimental effect on maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. The British side has taken a tolerant attitude towards this. Therefore, the British side bears an inescapable responsibility for the confidence issue in Hong Kong. Regrettably, the British side still insists on its erroneous position, which is why there were divergences on some major principle issues during the 13th meeting of the Joint Liaison Group held recently in London.

Ke said, the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration once brought Sino-British relations to the best period in history, which is the result of the long-term joint efforts of the governments of the two countries and should be cherished. Strictly implementing the Joint Declaration is in the interests and responsibilities of both the Chinese and British sides. We have noted the British government's commitment to fully and seriously implement the Joint Declaration, and we hope the British government will turn this commitment into actual action. In the future work of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the Chinese side will continue to adhere to the implementation of all the provisions of the Joint Declaration and strive for the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and the smooth handover of power in 1997.

### 就香港局势和中英联络小组工作  柯在铄大使发表谈话

    就香港局势和中英联络小组工作
    柯在铄大使发表谈话
    新华社香港10月8日电　新华社记者就当前香港局势和中英联合联络小组近期工作，走访了刚刚出席中英联合联络小组第13次会议归来的中方首席代表柯在铄大使。
    柯大使说，12次联合联络小组会议以来的这段时间，中英关系和香港局势发生了许多事情。在北京平息反革命暴乱前后，由于不了解事实真相，加上一些传播媒介的错误报道甚至造谣传谣，许多人产生了一些疑虑和误会，这是可以理解的。我国领导人一再阐明，中国的政局是稳定的，经济是不断发展的，我们的改革、开放政策以及按照“一国两制”构想制定的对港、澳的方针政策不会改变，港澳同胞完全可以放心。造成当前香港信心问题的重要原因，是英国方面一些不负责任的行动。今年6月英方单方面宣布中断中英联合联络小组工作就产生了消极的后果。极少数人利用香港进行破坏和企图颠覆中国政府的活动，对维护香港的稳定繁荣产生了极为不利的影响，而英方对此采取了纵容的态度。因此，英方对于香港的信心问题负有不可推卸的责任。遗憾的是，英方至今仍坚持错误立场，这也就是为什么最近在伦敦召开的联合联络小组第13次会议上双方在一些重大原则问题上存在分歧的原因。
    柯大使说，中英联合声明的签署，曾使中英关系处于历史上最好的时期，这是中英两国政府长期共同努力的结果，应该予以珍视。严格执行联合声明，是中英双方的利益所在，责任所在。我们注意到英国政府承诺要全面、认真执行联合声明的态度，我们希望英国政府把这一承诺变为实际行动。在今后中英联合联络小组的工作中，中方将继续坚持贯彻执行联合声明的各项规定，为香港的稳定繁荣和1997年政权的顺利交接作出努力。
