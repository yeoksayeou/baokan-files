Shanghai has completed the construction of China's first short-term disaster weather monitoring, forecasting, and service system. Operational trials have shown that the accuracy of forecasts within a 3-hour window has increased by 10% compared to conventional forecasts, and the effectiveness of short-term forecasts has reached the level of international counterparts in 1983.

Short-term disaster weather monitoring and forecasting is a hotspot and a challenging area in the international meteorological community. The "Research on Shanghai Region Short-Term Disaster Weather Monitoring, Forecasting, and Service System," undertaken by the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau and implemented by the Shanghai Central Meteorological Observatory and the Yangtze River Delta Short-Term Disaster Weather Warning System, is a key project of the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan." This system can promptly transmit forecasts to relevant departments.

　　沪实施短时灾害性天气测报
    本报上海10月23日电　记者萧关根报道：我国第一个短时灾害性天气监测、预报、服务系统在上海建成。业务试验表明：3小时以内预报的准确率比常规预报提高10％，短时预报效果达到1983年国际同类系统的水平。
    短时灾害性天气监测预报是国际气象界关注的热点和难点。由上海市气象局承担、上海中心气象台和长江三角洲短时灾害性天气预警系统业务试验所负责实施的“上海地区短时灾害性天气监测、预报、服务系统的研究”，是国家“七五”重点攻关项目，它能够将预报及时传递到有关部门。
