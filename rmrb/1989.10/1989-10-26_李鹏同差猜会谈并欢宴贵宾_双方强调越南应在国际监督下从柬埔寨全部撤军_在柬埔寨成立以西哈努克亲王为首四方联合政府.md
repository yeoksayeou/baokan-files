	Li Peng Meets with Chatchai and Hosts a Banquet for Distinguished Guests
	Both Sides Emphasize Vietnam Should Withdraw from Cambodia Under International Supervision
	Establish a Four-Party Joint Government in Cambodia Led by Prince Sihanouk

	BEIJING, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) — Reporter Wen Xian — Premier Li Peng met with Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan this morning at the Great Hall of the People for a working discussion. In a friendly atmosphere, both sides exchanged views on Sino-Thai bilateral relations and the Cambodian issue.

	Li Peng first extended a warm welcome to Chatchai for his second visit to China since becoming Thai Prime Minister. Chatchai expressed his gratitude, saying, "Being in China is like being at home."

	During the discussion on the Cambodian issue, Chatchai said, "I do not believe that Vietnam has completely withdrawn from Cambodia, because we do not have our own monitoring group to supervise Vietnam's withdrawal. Before coming to China, I had already expressed this view to the Thai press." Chatchai suggested establishing an international monitoring mechanism before fully resolving the Cambodian issue and reiterated that a four-party joint government led by Prince Sihanouk should be established in Cambodia.

	Li Peng said, "China sincerely hopes that the war in Cambodia can end as soon as possible and that the Cambodian issue can be politically resolved as soon as possible."

	He said, "Vietnam has not yet completely withdrawn from Cambodia. The reason the Paris Conference failed is that Vietnam took an uncooperative attitude on the issues of international supervision of Vietnam's withdrawal and the establishment of a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk." He said, "From the current reality in Cambodia, only a four-party joint government can be established."

	Li Peng emphasized, "We advocate that the Cambodian issue should be comprehensively resolved. This not only serves the interests of the Cambodian people but also benefits regional peace and stability. We do not want to see the current situation in Afghanistan repeated in Cambodia."

	Chatchai said, "Sino-Thai relations are a model of close relations between countries with different social systems. Thailand's policy towards China has not changed. Regardless of the attitude of other countries towards China, Sino-Thai friendly and neighborly relations will not change. Thailand will maintain and develop friendly and close relations with China."

	Li Peng appreciated Chatchai's understanding of China's recent actions to quell the unrest. He said, "Most countries have expressed understanding of this action by the Chinese government. China has not harmed the interests of other countries. We also do not allow other countries to harm China's interests. China will not close its own door, but China will not compromise on principles."

	Both sides also discussed the issue of further developing bilateral relations. Both sides took a positive attitude towards this.

	BEIJING, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) — Reporter Wen Xian — Premier Li Peng hosted a banquet this evening at the Great Hall of the People to welcome Thai Prime Minister Chatchai and his entourage.

	In his toast, Li Peng said, "China and Thailand are close friendly neighbors. Since my visit to your country last November, we have met three times in less than a year, which fully demonstrates the close relations between China and Thailand. The frequent exchanges between leaders and officials at various levels have deepened mutual understanding and trust, enhanced traditional friendship between the two peoples, and also strongly promoted the development of mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields such as politics, economy, science and technology, and culture. Your visit this time shows your friendship, understanding, and support for China. We highly appreciate and sincerely thank you for this. Practice has proven that the Sino-Thai friendly and neighborly relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are full of vitality and can withstand the test of time."

	In his response, Chatchai praised the Sino-Thai cooperative relationship, saying it is filled with friendship and mutual assistance and mutual benefit, whether in difficult or smooth times.

	He said, "Another important matter I want to discuss during this visit is the Cambodian issue, which is directly related to peace in the Southeast Asian region. For the past decade, Thailand and China have closely cooperated in seeking a solution to the Cambodian issue. Now, we are beginning to see progress in the Cambodian issue, which is the result of our joint efforts with countries around the world." He further explained Thailand's stance on resolving the Cambodian issue.

	Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, State Councilor Luo Gan, and Thai Ambassador to China Dej Bunnag attended the banquet.

　　李鹏同差猜会谈并欢宴贵宾
　　双方强调越南应在国际监督下从柬埔寨全部撤军
　　在柬埔寨成立以西哈努克亲王为首四方联合政府
    本报北京10月25日讯　记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今天上午在人民大会堂同泰王国总理差猜·春哈旺举行了工作会谈。双方在友好的气氛中就中泰双边关系和柬埔寨问题交换了意见。
    李鹏首先对差猜担任泰国总理以来第二次访华表示热烈欢迎。差猜对此表示感谢，他说，到了中国就像到了自己的家一样。
    在讨论柬埔寨问题时，差猜说，我不相信越南已从柬埔寨全部撤军，因为我们没有自己的监督小组来监督越南撤军。我在来中国前已向泰国报界表明了这个观点。差猜总理建议在全面解决柬埔寨问题前，先成立国际监督机制，并重申应该在柬埔寨成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府。
    李鹏说，中国真诚地希望在柬埔寨的这场战争能尽早尽快地结束，柬埔寨问题能尽早尽快地得到政治解决。
    他说，越南迄今未从柬埔寨全部撤军。巴黎会议失败的原因是，在国际监督越南撤军和成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府问题上，越南采取了不合作的态度。他说，从当前柬埔寨的现实情况看，在柬埔寨只能搞四方联合。
    李鹏强调说，我们主张，柬埔寨问题应得到全面解决。因为这不仅符合柬埔寨人民的利益，而且还有利于地区的和平与稳定。我们不希望看到目前阿富汗的局势在柬埔寨重演。
    差猜说，泰中关系是不同社会制度国家发展密切关系的典范。泰国对中国的政策没有改变。不管别的国家对中国采取什么态度，泰中之间的睦邻友好关系不会改变。泰国将保持和发展同中国友好、密切的关系。
    李鹏对差猜总理理解中国不久前的平暴行动表示赞赏。他说，对中国政府的这个行动，大部分国家都表示理解。中国没有损害别国的利益。我们也不允许别国损害中国的利益。中国决不会自己把大门关上，但中国也不会拿原则来做交易。
    双方还讨论了进一步发展双边关系的问题。对此，双方都持积极态度。
    本报北京10月25日讯　记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今晚在人民大会堂举行宴会，欢迎泰国总理差猜一行。
    李鹏在宴会祝酒辞中说，中泰两国是亲密的友好近邻，自去年11月我访问贵国以来，在不到一年的时间内，我们三次相聚，这充分显示了中泰两国的密切关系。两国领导人和各层次官员的频繁交往，不断加深相互的了解和信任，增进了两国人民的传统友谊，同时也有力地推动了两国政治、经济、科技和文化等各个领域互利合作关系的发展。阁下这次来访，表示了对中国的友谊、理解和支持，我们对此表示高度赞赏和衷心感谢。实践证明，建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的中泰睦邻友好关系具有强大的生命力，是经得住考验的。
    差猜总理在答辞中称赞泰中两国的合作关系不仅充满着友谊，并且无论在困难还是顺利的时刻都能体现出相互帮助和互利的特点。
    他说，我这次访华要谈的另一件重要事情是与东南亚地区和平直接相关的柬埔寨问题。10年来，泰国和中国在寻求解决柬埔寨问题上密切合作。如今，我们开始看到柬埔寨问题的进展，这是我们同世界各国一道努力奋斗的结果。他还进一步说明了泰国政府对解决柬埔寨问题的主张。
    国务院副总理吴学谦、国务院秘书长罗干等，以及泰国驻华大使德·汶纳出席了宴会。
