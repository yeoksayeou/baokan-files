Around the porcelain capital of Jingdezhen, there is a green necklace composed of 300,000 mu of timber forests and 110,000 mu of oil tea and shrubs. The operator of this green necklace is the largest state-owned forest farm in Jiangxi Province—Fengshushan Forest Farm.

From some unknown time, the dense forest is no longer as quiet as it used to be. Fengshushan has become lively. Apart from the laughter and the roar of machinery from people working, there are also many people, including foreigners, coming here to visit and inspect.

Why has Fengshushan become so lively? This story begins in 1982.

That early spring, the mountain flowers bloomed along the valleys and streams. A few long strings of firecrackers suddenly exploded between two old flat-roofed houses in the valley, and the first enterprise baby of Fengshushan—Hu Feng Food Factory—was born. The crisp sound of firecrackers carried the new hopes of the people of Fengshushan.

Three masters invited from Shanghai indeed had extraordinary skills. In less than half a month, the food factory produced more than ten varieties of delicious and fragrant cream cakes and cream flowers, with a daily production of more than 200 kilograms of food. The food factory was in a frenzy. However, when they respectfully delivered the cakes they had worked so hard to produce to the state-owned food store in the city, they were met with a bucket of cold water: "Woodcutters making cakes. Want to sell? Go set up a stall!"

The people of Fengshushan indeed had a bit of stubbornness. If they had to set up a stall, then they would set up a stall. The next morning, 16 employees of the food factory all went out. They carried poles and pushed carts, loaded with full cakes, and pulled up a self-made banner with the words "Hu Feng Food Factory." They set up stalls and points in the city and outside the city. In just one morning, more than 200 kilograms of cakes were sold out.

The people of Fengshushan finally broke through the closed mountain gate for the first time, taking the first step in developing industry and commerce from forestry. In just half a year, their food factory launched more than 40 varieties of products, increasing daily cake production to more than 450 kilograms.

Reform is not an easy path; it is like the winding and bumpy roads in the Fengshushan forest area.

After the food factory, Fengshushan Forest Farm successively established an eyeglass factory and a feather factory. However, due to weak technical strength, lack of management experience, and mismatched production and sales, both factories failed within half a year...

However, the people of Fengshushan were not deterred by the setbacks.

At a full staff meeting, Director Shen Genduo gave an impassioned speech: "We will continue to establish factories, not just one or two, but seven or eight, even more. But we need to increase scientific knowledge and management skills."

Not long after, Fenglin Porcelain Factory, Timber Factory, and other farm-run enterprises emerged like sailing ships with full sails, striving in the vast sea of commodity economy.

These people, who used to be "country bumpkins" dealing with mountains and forests all day, turned out to be quite good at "finding loopholes" when running factories. Jingdezhen Porcelain Factory has many strong players, but people prefer to do big things, and few people pay attention to small items like teacups and bowls. Fengshushan Forest Farm saw this opportunity and decisively invested more than 100,000 yuan to establish Fenglin Porcelain Factory.

In just one month, the porcelain factory with only 20-plus people produced more than 500 piculs of bowls and blue-and-white dragon teacups. The products quickly opened up markets in Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces and regions among ethnic minorities. The porcelain factory became more and more prosperous, with production value and profits rising steadily, and workers' incomes increasing every month. It became the factory with the highest average income in Fengshushan.

In the summer of 1988, the provincial forestry diversified operation conference was held in Fengshushan. The representatives toured the industrial city that had risen in Fengshushan:

Around the general farm headquarters, there are Fengshushan Radio Component Factory, Timber Factory, Porcelain Factory, Crafts Factory, Automobile Transportation Company, Forest Trade Company, Food Factory, and Forest Park. Several cadres who had been to Fengshushan in the 1960s saw the scene before them and exclaimed, "It has changed, the change is too great."

Today's Fengshushan is wealthy and prosperous. However, they have not forgotten their main business of forestry. By using industry to support forestry and promote forestry, forestry has also flourished. The current stock volume of nearly 300,000 mu of artificial forests in Fengshushan is valued at more than 180 million yuan.

### 瓷都的绿项链

    瓷都的绿项链
    刘伟成
    在瓷都景德镇的周围，有一条由30万亩用材林，11万亩油茶、灌木组成的绿色项链。经营这条绿色项链的就是江西省最大的国营林场——枫树山林场。
    不知从何时起，密林深处不像过去那么安静了，枫树山热闹起来。除了人们劳动的欢声笑语和机器的轰鸣外，还有不少人，包括外国人来这里参观、考察。
  枫树山何以热闹起来？这还得从1982年说起。
    那年初春早暖，山花缀满了山沟溪旁，几挂长长的鞭炮在山谷的两间旧平房间猛然炸响，枫树山第一个企业婴儿——沪枫食品厂诞生了。清脆的鞭炮声，寄托了枫树山人新的希望。
    从上海请来的三位师傅果然身手不凡，不到半个月，食品厂就生产出了色美味香的奶油梅花蛋糕、奶油拉花等10多个品种，日产食品200多公斤，食品厂沸腾了。然而当他们把辛辛苦苦生产的糕点恭恭敬敬地送到市内国营食品店，迎接他们的却是一盆凉水：“砍木头的，也来做糕点。要卖？摆地摊去吧！”
    枫树山人还真有点犟劲，摆地摊就摆地摊。第二天一早，食品厂16名职工一齐出动。挑担推车，装上满满的糕点，扯起赶做的印有枫沪食品厂字样的彩旗，市内市外，四处摆摊设点。仅一个上午，200多公斤糕点就销售一空。
    枫树山人终于冲开了封闭多年的山门，第一次迈出了林业办工业、林业办商业的步伐。仅仅半年时间，他们的食品厂就推出了40多个花色品种，日产糕点增加到450多公斤。
    改革并非坦途，它就像枫树山林区的小路一样坎坷不平。
    继食品厂之后，枫树山林场又相继办起了眼镜厂和羽毛厂，结果由于技术力量薄弱、管理经验不足和产销不对路等原因，不到半年，两个工厂便先后夭折……
    但是，枫树山人并没有被挫折吓倒。
    在全场干部大会上，场长沈根度慷慨陈词：“工厂我们还要办，不仅办一个两个，要办七个八个甚至更多，但要增加科学头脑，增加管理知识。”
    时隔不久，枫林瓷厂、木材厂……一个个场办企业就像一只只满张风帆的航船，奋争在商品经济的大海中。
    别看这些人过去都是成天与山林打交道的“土包子”，办起厂来，还挺会“钻空子”。景德镇瓷厂强手如林，然而人们争相干大的，一些利少的茶杯、饭碗之类的“小玩艺”，却很少有人看上眼。枫树山林场瞅准了这一空子，果断地投资10多万元，办起了枫林瓷厂。
    一个月内，仅20多人的瓷厂就生产出了饭碗和青花双龙茶杯500多担，产品迅速在宁夏、甘肃、青海等省区的少数民族地区打开销路。瓷厂越办越红火，产值和利润一个劲地上升，职工收入月月增加，成了枫树山人平收入最高的一个厂。
    1988年的夏天，全省林业多种经营会议在枫树山召开。代表们游览了枫树山崛起的工业城：
    在总场场部周围，排列着枫树山的无线电元件厂、木材厂、瓷厂、工艺厂、汽车运输公司、林贸公司、食品厂和森林公园。几位60年代到过枫树山的干部见到眼前的情景，都连连说，变了，变化太大了。
    如今的枫树山，已是财大气粗。然而他们没有忘记林业这个主业。以工养林、促林，林业也兴旺起来。枫树山现有的近30万亩人工林的蓄积量，价值达1.8亿多元。
