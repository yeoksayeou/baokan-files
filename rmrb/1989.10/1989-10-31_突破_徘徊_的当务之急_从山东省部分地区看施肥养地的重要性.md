	Breaking the Stagnation: The Urgent Need for Fertilization and Soil Improvement
	—— From a Survey of Some Regions in Shandong Province
	Zhang Jun, Meng Jianwei

	From 1986 to 1988, the total grain production in Shandong Province hovered around 32 billion kilograms without significant breakthroughs. Recently, we conducted a survey in the major grain-producing areas of Heze, Jining, Tai'an, and Zaozhuang. We found that there are many factors affecting grain production, but one of the main reasons is that the input of organic and inorganic fertilizers does not match the needs of sustained grain production growth.

	After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, both the fertilizer input and grain production in Shandong Province saw significant increases. By 1985, the province's average input of farmyard manure and chemical fertilizers per mu (approximately 0.0667 hectares) reached 2,000 kilograms and 17.5 kilograms, respectively. The grain yield and total production increased by 64.7% and 37.2%, respectively. However, after 1986, the problems of insufficient fertilizer input and irrational input structure became increasingly prominent, affecting the development of grain production.

	Insufficient organic fertilizer input in high-yield fields. In recent years, although various places in Shandong have increased the input of organic fertilizers in high-yield fields, the input of organic nutrients is generally less than the output, leading to a continuous depletion of organic matter and other nutrients without effective compensation. Many plots have seen a reduction in organic matter and other nutrient content, resulting in a year-on-year decline in the utilization efficiency of the large amount of chemical fertilizers applied. For example, in Jining and Tai'an, the yield increase per kilogram of chemical fertilizer applied to wheat has decreased from the previous 10 kilograms to 6-7 kilograms. Due to the insufficient input of organic fertilizers, soil fertility cannot support the sustained increase in grain production.

	Insufficient chemical fertilizer input in medium- and low-yield fields. Medium- and low-yield fields account for more than 70% of the total cultivated land in Shandong Province, and the soil fertility of these fields is low. According to calculations, each additional kilogram of chemical fertilizer applied to medium- and low-yield fields can increase wheat production by 13.8 to 15.5 kilograms, more than double the effect in high-yield fields. However, in recent years, due to the prominent supply-demand contradiction of chemical fertilizers, the input of chemical fertilizers in most regions has not significantly increased, constraining grain production. In Heze, where medium- and low-yield fields are concentrated, the annual application of chemical fertilizers per mu has remained at around 6 kilograms from 1985 to 1988, only half of the provincial average, and thus the grain yield has stagnated around 400 kilograms per mu.

	Imbalanced fertilizer ratio. According to calculations, the optimal application ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers in Shandong Province should be 1:0.55:0.2. However, the current application ratio is 1:0.33:0.08. The input of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers is significantly insufficient, especially phosphorus fertilizers. As a result, the effectiveness of the already insufficient fertilizer input is not fully utilized due to the irrational input structure. The yield increase effect of chemical fertilizers applied to wheat and corn is 11.46% and 9.4% lower than the national average, respectively.

	Shandong Province has over 100 million mu of cultivated land, including 29.57 million mu of high-yield fields and 73.87 million mu of medium- and low-yield fields. From the survey, it can be seen that to break the current stagnation in grain production, increasing fertilizer input and rationally adjusting the fertilizer input structure is an urgent task. According to experts, under the current conditions of unchanged grain varieties and chemical fertilizer input, if the organic matter content in high-yield fields is increased from the current 1% to 1.2% to 1.2% to 1.5%, the grain yield per mu can be increased by about 100 kilograms, resulting in an additional 3 billion kilograms of grain production for the province. If the chemical fertilizer input in medium- and low-yield fields is increased from the current 12 kilograms per mu to 17 kilograms under the premise of improving cultivation levels, improving soil moisture, and ensuring that organic matter does not decrease, the grain yield per mu can be increased by about 75 kilograms, resulting in an additional 5.5 billion kilograms of grain production for the province. The combined increase in grain production from high-yield and medium- and low-yield fields is 8.5 billion kilograms, accounting for more than 1/4 of the current total grain production.

	To rationally increase agricultural fertilizer input and promote stable and high grain production, we believe the following aspects should be addressed:

	Develop and utilize organic fertilizer sources through multiple channels. In recent years, although the livestock industry in Shandong Province has developed rapidly, it is still in the development stage overall. Currently, the province has over 30 billion kilograms of crop stalks that can be used as feed, but less than half are used for "manure to soil"; the province produces 1.5 billion kilograms of cottonseed cake annually, but less than 1/4 is used as feed; there are over 20 million mu of usable grasslands, but only 3% are developed and utilized. If these resources are fully utilized, it is possible to raise an additional 4 million head of cattle or 20 million sheep, doubling the annual organic fertilizer production. At the same time, further incentive measures should be taken to encourage households to raise pigs.

	Straw return to field is an important source of organic fertilizer. Currently, the province has 15 billion kilograms of crop stalks that can be used for fertilizer and returned to the field, but the utilization rate is less than 30%, with great potential for development. According to experiments in Jining and Zaozhuang over three consecutive years, returning 200 to 300 kilograms of straw per mu to the field increases soil organic matter by 0.02% to 0.08% annually, increases the water content of the plow layer by 17.7% to 48.6%, and increases grain yield by an average of 10%. From 1986 to 1988, Zaozhuang returned a cumulative total of 2.489 million mu of straw to the field, increasing grain production by over 80 million kilograms.

	Urban domestic waste and excrement are a significant fertilizer resource. Shandong Province's large and medium-sized cities produce approximately 2.16 million tons of domestic waste annually, with most of it directly landfilled and rarely utilized; approximately 700,000 tons of excrement are produced annually, with over 70% discharged through sewers, and only about 25% used as fertilizer. There is great potential in this area. Additionally, it is possible to fully utilize barren mountains, barren slopes, fallow land, orchards, and water surfaces to develop green manure, mobilize the masses to expand the sources of farmyard manure, and accumulate and produce a large amount of soil and miscellaneous fertilizers, utilizing all available organic fertilizer sources.

	Accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry, protect and mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for increasing fertilizer application. Given the prominent supply-demand contradiction, structural imbalance, and continuous price increases in chemical fertilizers, the key to solving the fertilizer problem is to increase investment in chemical fertilizer production and adjust the structure to reduce costs. While vigorously developing nitrogen fertilizers, the production of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers should be accelerated to strive for a short-term adjustment of the supply ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers to 1:0.5:0.3, quickly reversing the imbalance of nutrient input in farmland. In terms of allocation, the supply to medium- and low-yield fields with high potential for increased fertilizer production should be increased.

	Include the scientific research and promotion of advanced technology of fertilizers in the agricultural science and technology development plan as an important part of "Science and Technology for Agriculture." In recent years, the scientific research, management, and application technology of fertilizers, especially organic fertilizers, have been insufficient in various places, with few scientific and technological achievements and weak promotion of advanced technologies. On one hand, most places still use traditional methods of fertilizer production and application, with high labor intensity and low production and utilization efficiency; on the other hand, some scientifically proven important new technologies for fertilizer production and application have a very low promotion and popularization rate. For example, corn straw return to field and high stubble retention for wheat, due to the lack of crushing, processing, and stubble removal technology, the implementation methods in various places are backward, labor-intensive, and difficult for farmers to accept. In this regard, it is necessary to organize research, education, and promotion departments to work together to solve some difficulties in fertilizer production and use by farmers. For example, developing and providing machinery for the production and application of fertilizers that save labor, concentrating and processing organic fertilizers, and new technologies and processes for the industrial treatment of urban human excrement, garbage, and livestock and poultry manure. It is also necessary to fully leverage the existing multi-level science and technology promotion system and network, accelerate the promotion and application of fertilizer research results, and transform them into real productive forces on a large scale.

　　突破“徘徊”的当务之急
　　——从山东省部分地区看施肥养地的重要性
　　张俊　孟建伟
    1986年至1988年，山东省粮食总产一直在320亿公斤左右徘徊，没有大的突破。最近，我们对菏泽、济宁、泰安、枣庄等粮食主产区进行了一次调查，发现影响粮食生产的因素很多，而其中一个主要原因，是农田有机肥和无机肥的投入与粮食持续增长的需要不相适应。
    党的十一届三中全会后，山东省农田肥料和粮食产量均有较大幅度增长。到1985年，全省亩施农家肥和化肥分别达到2000公斤和17.5公斤，粮食单产和总产分别增加64.7％和37.2％。而1986年以后，肥料投入不足和投入结构不合理的问题日渐突出，影响了粮食生产的发展。
    高产田有机肥投入不足。近几年，山东各地尽管对高产田的有机肥料投入较多，但有机养份的投入普遍小于输出，不断消耗掉的有机质等养份得不到有效补偿，许多地块有机质等养份含量减少，致使大量投入的化肥利用效率逐年下降。如济宁、泰安两市的高产农田，每投入1公斤化肥，增产小麦由过去的10公斤减少到6至7公斤。由于有机肥投入不足，土壤肥力无法支持粮食产量持续增长。
    中低产田化肥投入满足不了粮食大幅度增产的需要。山东省中低产田面积占耕地总面积的70％以上，这部分耕地土壤肥力低。据测算，中低产田每增施1公斤化肥，可增产小麦13.8公斤至15.5公斤，增产效果是高产田的两倍以上。但是近几年来，由于化肥供求矛盾突出，大部分地区中低产田化肥投入没明显增加，制约了粮食增产。在中低产田集中的菏泽地区，1985年到1988年，每亩年施化肥一直是6公斤左右，仅为全省平均量的一半，因而该地粮食单产也总在400公斤上下踏步。
    投肥比例失调。　据测算，山东省农田氮、磷、钾肥最佳施用比例应为1∶0.55∶0.2，但目前施肥比例为1∶0.33∶0.08。磷、钾肥投入明显不足，磷肥尤其缺乏。结果本来就投入不足的肥料的肥效又由于投入结构不合理而得不到充分发挥，小麦、玉米两大作物施用化肥的增产效果分别比全国平均水平低11.46％和9.4％。
    山东省现有耕地1亿多亩，其中高产田2957万亩，中低产田7387万亩。从调查的情况可以看到，要打破目前粮食徘徊局面，增加肥料投入和合理调整肥料投入结构是当务之急。据有关专家分析，在目前粮食种植品种和化肥投入不变的情况下，全省高产田有机质含量由现在的1％至1.2％，提高到1.2％至1.5％，粮食单产即可增100公斤左右，全省可增产粮食30亿公斤。中低产田在提高耕作水平、改善土壤水份和保证有机质不下降的前提下，化肥投入如果由现在的亩施12公斤增加到17公斤，粮食单产即可增75公斤左右，全省总产可增55亿公斤。高、中低产田合计全省可增产粮食85亿公斤，相当于目前粮食总产的1／4以上。
    为合理加大农田肥料投入，促进粮食稳产高产，我们认为当前应做好以下几方面的工作：
    多途径开发利用有机肥源。近年来，山东省畜牧业虽然发展较快，但总体上说，还处于开发时期。目前全省可作饲料的农作物秸秆有300多亿公斤，而真正用于“过腹还田”的不足一半；全省年产棉籽饼15亿公斤，用作饲料的不足1／4；可利用的草场2000多万亩，现在只开发利用3％。如果把上述资源充分利用起来，可多养400万头牛或2000万只羊，年有机肥料产量可翻一番。同时，应进一步采取鼓励措施，调动千家万户养猪的积极性。
    秸秆还田，是有机肥的重要来源。目前全省农作物秸秆150亿公斤可用于造肥还田，但这部分肥源利用率不足30％，开发潜力很大。据济宁、枣庄连续三年试验，每亩还田秸秆200至300公斤，土壤有机质年递增0.02％至0.08％，耕作层含水量增加17.7％至48.6％，粮食平均增产10％左右。枣庄1986年至1988年累计秸秆还田248.9万亩，增产粮食8000多万公斤。
    城市生活垃圾和粪便是一大肥料资源。山东省大中城市年积生活垃圾约216万吨，绝大部分直接填埋，很少利用；年积粪便约70万吨，有70％以上随下水道排走，用作肥料的仅占25％左右。这方面有很大潜力可挖。此外，还可充分利用荒山、荒坡、隙地、果园、水面等大力发展绿肥，动员群众广辟农家肥源，大积大造土杂肥，把一切可利用的有机肥源都利用起来。
    加快化肥工业发展步伐，保护和调动农民增施化肥的积极性。鉴于当前化肥供求矛盾突出，生产结构失调，价格持续上涨等情况，解决化肥问题的关键是要加大化肥生产投入，调整结构，降低成本。应在大力发展氮肥的同时，加快磷、钾肥的生产，力争在短期内将氮、磷、钾化肥的供应比例调整为1∶0.5∶0.3，以迅速扭转农田营养输入不平衡状态。在分配上，应增加对投肥增产潜力大的中低产田的供应数量。
    把肥料的科学研究和先进技术的推广纳入农业科技开发规划，作为“科技兴农”的重要内容来抓。近年来，各地对肥料特别是有机肥的科学积造、管理和施用技术研究不够，科技成果少，先进技术推广不力。一方面，大多数地方仍沿用传统的造肥、施肥方法，劳动强度大，生产和利用效率低；另一方面，一些经试验证明有重要推广价值的科学造肥、施肥新技术推广普及率很低。如经济效益较好的玉米秸秆还田和小麦高留茬肥田，由于缺乏粉碎加工、灭茬等方面的技术，各地实施手段落后，费工费事，农民很难接受。对此，要组织科研、教育、推广部门协作攻关，解决好农民造肥、用肥中的一些难题。如研制提供积造和施用肥料省工省力的机具，浓缩加工有机肥以及城市人粪尿、垃圾和畜禽场粪肥工厂化处理新技术、新工艺等。还应充分发挥现有各级科技推广体系和网络的作用，加快肥料科研成果的推广和应用，使之大面积转化为现实的生产力。
