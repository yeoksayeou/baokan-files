Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 12th.

The Ministry of Public Security recently issued a notice, calling on public security organs and the People's Armed Police nationwide to learn from the firefighting heroes of Huangdao.

On August 12, 1989, a major fire broke out at the Huangdao oil depot of the China National Petroleum Corporation in Qingdao. Over 1,000 public security and firefighting personnel from Qingdao City and Shandong Province fought against the raging flames. After 104 hours of intense battle, they extinguished the fire, successfully protecting the Huangdao oil port and the city of Qingdao, and preventing the 280-kilometer-long Donghuang oil pipeline from becoming unusable due to freezing. During the firefighting, 14 officers, including Yan Zhenglian, sacrificed their lives, and 85 officers were injured.

To learn from the fearless and selfless spirit of the firefighting heroes and further shoulder the glorious mission of safeguarding the Four Modernizations, the Ministry of Public Security issued the notice. It calls on all public security organs and the People's Armed Police to, in conjunction with studying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, extensively and deeply carry out activities to learn from the firefighting heroes of Huangdao. The notice requires that all officers in public security organs and the People's Armed Police learn from the firefighting heroes' broad-mindedness and unconditional loyalty to the Party and the people; learn from their revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death; learn from their swift and decisive, united, and cooperative work style; and learn from the exemplary behavior of their leaders who lead by example and personally go to the front lines.
