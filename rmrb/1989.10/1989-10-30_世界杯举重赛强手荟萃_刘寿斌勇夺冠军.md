Xinhua News Agency, Portugal, Lorés, October 28th.

Chinese athlete Liu Shoubin today defeated a strong field to win the gold medal at the World Cup Weightlifting Championships held in the Portuguese city of Lorés.

Bulgarian athlete I. Ivanov and Turkish weightlifting prodigy N. Suleymanoglu took second and third places, respectively.

The World Cup was organized by the International Weightlifting Federation. Fifteen elite weightlifters from China, Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Turkey, and eight other countries participated in today's competition. Most of these athletes were champions of the 1989 World Weightlifting Championships.

The World Cup Weightlifting Championships do not have weight classes; instead, each competitor has a standard to meet. Those who exceed the standard receive additional points, and the final ranking is determined by the total score.

Liu Shoubin is the recent gold medalist in the 56 kg snatch event at the World Weightlifting Championships and holds the world record for the 56 kg snatch with a lift of 134.5 kg.

In today's snatch competition, Liu Shoubin performed well, lifting 127.5 kg and 132.5 kg consecutively. He then attempted a 135 kg lift to challenge his own world record but was unsuccessful. In the clean and jerk event, Liu Shoubin lifted 152.5 kg. His total score was 285 kg, 10 kg above the standard.

Turkish star Suleymanoglu was the favorite to win today, but he was injured during the clean and jerk event and had to withdraw, finishing in third place.

After the competition, International Weightlifting Federation Secretary-General Ojan Damasch presented the trophy to Liu Shoubin. The Chinese national flag was raised to the sound of the national anthem, standing tall and proud in the arena.

　　世界杯举重赛强手荟萃
　　刘寿斌勇夺冠军
    新华社葡萄牙洛雷斯10月28日电  （记者刘大龙）中国运动员刘寿斌今天下午在葡萄牙中部城市洛雷斯举行的世界杯举重赛上力克群雄，勇夺冠军。
    保加利亚运动员伊·伊万诺夫和土耳其举重神童奈·苏莱马诺尔古分获亚军和第三名。
    这次世界杯赛是由国际举重联合会主办的。来自中国、保加利亚、苏联、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国、土耳其等11个国家的15名优秀举重运动员参加了今天的比赛。他们中的绝大部分人是今年的世界举重锦标赛冠军获得者。
    世界杯举重赛比赛不分级别，每个级别的选手都有达标标准，超标准者加分，根据得分排出总名次。
    刘寿斌是前不久结束的世界举重锦标赛56公斤级抓举金牌得主，并保持着56公斤级抓举134.5公斤的世界纪录。
    在今天的抓举比赛中，刘寿斌技术发挥正常，接连举起127.5公斤和132.5公斤，最后他要了135公斤，准备冲击他本人保持的世界纪录，但未能如愿。在挺举比赛中，刘寿斌举起152.5公斤。这样他的总成绩达285公斤，超标10公斤。
    土耳其名将苏莱马诺尔古是今天夺标的热门人物，但他在挺举比赛中受伤，不得不退出比赛，只得了个第三名。
    比赛结束后，国际举重联合会秘书长奥扬·道马什把本次比赛的奖杯授给了刘寿斌。中国的五星红旗在雄伟庄严的国歌声中在会场上冉冉升起。
