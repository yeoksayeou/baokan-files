Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 29th - (Reporter Zhao Lan Ying) Among the recently selected outstanding books of Shanghai from 1985 to 1988, large-scale publications that are rich in knowledge, voluminous, and beautifully bound occupy a significant proportion. This indicates that the publishing level in Shanghai has reached a new height.

The publication of a large-scale book requires mobilizing a vast force and years of effort. The authors of the "Hanyu Da Cidian" (Chinese Language Dictionary) number nearly a thousand, hailing from five provinces and municipalities, and after eleven years of hard work, the first volume was finally published in November 1986. Dr. Yang Zhenning praised it as "a major event of the 20th century in China." The 400-volume "Shenbao" (Shanghai News), although a reprint, required the editorial staff to spend years searching for the original copies and restoring damaged volumes.

The recently published "Ying-Han Da Cidian" (English-Chinese Dictionary) is the first comprehensive English-Chinese bilingual toolbook independently researched and compiled in China. The editor-in-chief of the "Oxford Dictionary" commented: "This is not only the best in China but also one of the best in the world."

Currently, large-scale books published in Shanghai include three categories: picture albums, reference materials, and tools. The publication of these books has helped build cultural landmarks in China, earning fame both domestically and internationally.

　　调动千军万马　构筑文化大厦
　　上海不断推出大型图书
    据新华社上海10月29日电  （记者赵兰英）在新近评出的1985—1988上海优秀图书中，知识密集、卷帙浩繁、装帧瑰丽的大型出版物占相当一部分比例。这表明上海出版水平又上了一个台阶。
    一部大型图书的问世，需要调动千军万马，多年奔波。《汉语大词典》作者近千，来自5省市，历十一寒暑，方于1986年11月出版第1卷。杨振宁博士称其为“20世纪中国一件大事”。洋洋400册的《申报》，虽是影印，编辑人员却为寻底本，修复残卷，耗费了数年时间。
    不久前出版的《英汉大辞典》，是我国独立研编的第一部英汉双语多功能工具书，《牛津大辞典》主编称：“这不仅是中国最好的，在世界也称得是极好的。”
    目前，上海出版的大型图书，有画册、资料、工具三大类。这些图书的问世，为我国垒建起幢幢文化大厦，饮誉海内外。
