Leveraging Strengths, Avoiding Weaknesses, and Daring to Win—Inspiration from Li Fang's Victory Over "Asia's Queen" Wang Si-Ting

The 16-year-old girl from Hunan, Li Fang, defeated "Asia's Queen," Wang Si-Ting from Chinese Taipei, to win the women's singles championship at the Asian Tennis Championships. This result is exciting and also provides valuable insights.

The reporter interviewed several coaches from the Chinese team, who believe that Li Fang has three outstanding performances.

First, she dares to face strong opponents and seek victory. When facing strong opponents, some athletes become timid and quickly lose. Li Fang's strength lies in her fearlessness. Like a young calf, she is not afraid of tigers. No matter how strong the opponent, she fights to the end. She knows that Wang Si-Ting is formidable, with a powerful forehand that has defeated many top players. Li Fang's teammate Tang Min lost to Wang Si-Ting once, and Chen Li lost to her twice. Before the match, Li Fang heard many people saying she would also lose to the "Asia's Queen," but these comments did not affect her mood or confidence. Therefore, during the match, she dared to fight bravely and became more courageous as the game progressed.

Second, she tightly grasps the opponent's weaknesses and launches continuous attacks. Although Wang Si-Ting is skilled, she is not perfect. Her backhand is weak, and she often uses her forehand to compensate. Li Fang seized this weakness, avoiding her forehand and attacking her backhand, which disrupted "Asia's Queen's" strategy. The coaches said: Our players can usually play to their strengths, but they often fail to seize the opponent's weaknesses and launch continuous attacks. Li Fang sets a good example in this regard for other players.

Third, she employs a fast and agile strategy. Li Fang's attack speed is fast, pressing the opponent, and keeping the initiative in her own hands. At the same time, she uses wide angles to make the opponent run back and forth. This strategy ensures that Li Fang is in an unbeatable position.

Li Fang started playing tennis at the age of 8. While at the Xiangtan Steel Plant's children's school, she already showed outstanding talent. She is intelligent, competitive, and able to endure hardship. These excellent qualities laid a solid foundation for her rapid growth. After joining the national team, under the guidance of head coach Jiang Hongwei, her skills have continuously improved.

　　扬长避短敢打敢胜
　　——李芳战胜“亚洲皇后”王思婷的启迪
    16岁的湖南姑娘李芳战胜“亚洲皇后”中国台北选手王思婷，获得亚洲网球锦标赛女子单打冠军，这一战绩令人兴奋，同时也给人不少启迪。
    记者采访了几位中国队教练，他们认为李芳有三点表现突出。
    一、面对强手敢于胜利。在强手面前是毫不畏惧还是心慌意乱，这是衡量一个选手心理素质优劣的标志。有的运动员一见强手就不敢打，结果很快就败下阵来。李芳的长处就是不信邪，初生牛犊不怕虎，不管对手多么强，打了再说。她知道王思婷厉害，正手攻击力强，不少名将都败在她的拍下。李芳的队友唐敏输给王思婷一次，陈莉输给她两次。赛前，李芳曾听到不少自己也会输给“亚洲皇后”的议论，但这些都没有影响她的情绪和信心，所以在交锋时敢打敢拚，越打越勇。
    二、紧紧抓住对手的弱点连续进攻。王思婷虽然球艺高，但并非十全十美。她反拍打得不理想，常用正拍攻球来弥补。李芳抓住其弱点，避开正拍攻反拍，使“亚洲皇后”乱了阵脚。教练们说：我们的球手发挥自己的长处还能做到，但抓住对手的弱点，不停顿地攻击却往往做不到。李芳在这一点上对其他选手是很好的启发。
    三、发挥快速灵活的战术。李芳进攻速度快，压着对手打，把主动权掌握在自己的手中，同时拉大角度，调动其来回奔跑。这套战术使李芳立于不败之地。
    李芳8岁开始练球，在湘潭钢铁厂子弟学校时就表现突出，她聪明，好胜心强，又能吃苦，这些优秀的品质为她迅速成长奠定了良好的基础，进国家队后，在主教练蒋宏伟的指导下，技艺不断提高。
