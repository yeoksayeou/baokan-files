	He pursues a career—Recording the deeds of excellent Communist Party member Yin Binghao learning from Lei Feng
	Lu Shengjin

	In the land beneath Qipanshan and north of the Yalu River, he has endured wind and rain with unyielding will, drawing sustenance from the Party's nourishment, and followed in the footsteps of the Communist warrior Lei Feng for twenty-seven years. He is Yin Binghao, a Communist Party member and engineer from a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region. In July of this year, the Shenyang Military Region Logistics Department Committee issued an order: awarding Yin Binghao the title of Excellent Communist Party Member.

	Yin Binghao was born into a Korean family. In July 1961, with a sincere heart to defend and build the motherland, he entered the military camp, realizing a long-held wish.

	On one day in March 1962, Comrade Lei Feng was invited to give a report to cadres and soldiers in Siping, Jilin Province. Yin Binghao, as a representative of new soldiers, attended the report meeting. Soon after, when the news of Lei Feng's unfortunate death reached his ears, he cried for half a night in sorrow.

	More than twenty years have passed, and he has always taken Lei Feng as an example, using Lei Feng's spirit to inspire and urge himself on.

	After joining the army, Yin Binghao has been engaged in ammunition logistics support work, struggling in the mountains for twenty-eight springs and autumns. Like Lei Feng, he has an extremely responsible attitude towards work. He has risked his life more than ten times, helping more than forty warehouses and units handle various accidents over ninety times, traveling over fifty thousand kilometers.

	Before joining the army, Yin Binghao only had a junior high school education and had never been involved in ammunition chemical testing work.

	In the face of difficulties, he carried forward Lei Feng's "nail" spirit. He worked in the laboratory, starting with learning to wash bottles and assisting senior comrades in chemical tests as a supporting role. He did not understand the chemical reactions of smokeless explosives in tests or the physicochemical properties of the various components that make up smokeless explosives. However, he was not deterred by this problem but studied diligently and explored bravely. He used various instruments, equipment, and reagents, often staying alone in the laboratory for repeated experiments, spending countless sleepless nights. He organized small cards according to a certain procedure, starting from the simplest testing methods and testing steps, climbing step by step. Whenever there were meetings or outings, he always brought business books with him, studying whether in the waiting room or the guesthouse, and recording tens of thousands of words of study notes.

	Hard work pays off. His hard work yielded fruitful results. In 1988, his article "Methods for Managing Unexploded Ordnance" was published in the military equipment special edition of the "Forward" newspaper. At the beginning of this year, his article "Reform and Exploration of Ammunition Chemical Testing" was published in the military equipment maintenance engineering magazine. Recently, he and his comrades have also studied the use of new liquid chromatography testing methods in ammunition chemical testing, advancing towards a more scientific field.

	Looking back on his twenty-eight years of military life, he said with deep emotion: "It is the Party that has cultivated me into a military cadre. I want to work for the Party with all my heart, not for fame and fortune, and be willing to dedicate myself. My pursuit is a career."

　　他追求的是事业
　　——记优秀共产党员尹炳浩学雷锋的事迹
　　卢胜金
    在七盘山下，辽河北岸的大地上，他以顽强的斗志，经受着风风雨雨，吸吮着党的甘露，沿着共产主义战士雷锋的足迹走过了二十七个年头。他就是沈阳军区某部共产党员、工程师尹炳浩同志。今年七月，中共沈阳军区后勤部委员会发出通令：授予尹炳浩优秀共产党员称号。
    尹炳浩出生在一个朝鲜族家庭里。一九六一年七月，他怀着保卫祖国、建设祖国的赤诚之心，走进了军营，实现了多年的夙愿。
    一九六二年三月的一天，雷锋同志应邀在吉林省四平市为干部战士作报告，尹炳浩作为新战士代表出席了报告会。不久，当雷锋不幸牺牲的消息传到他耳边时，他悲痛地哭了半宿。
    二十多年过去了，他始终以雷锋为榜样，用雷锋精神鼓舞自己，鞭策自己。
    尹炳浩入伍后，一直从事弹药勤务保障工作，在山沟里奋斗了二十八个春秋。他像雷锋那样怀着对工作极端负责精神，先后十几次出生入死，冒着生命危险帮助四十多个仓库和部队处理各类事故九十多起，行程五万多公里。
    尹炳浩入伍前只有初中文化程度，从未接触过弹药化试验工作。
    在困难面前，他发扬雷锋的“钉子”精神。他到化验室工作，第一步是学刷瓶，为老同志搞化验充当配角儿。他不明白无烟炸药在化验中各种化学反应的原理，对组成无烟药的各种成份的理化性能感到无法理解。但他并没有被这一难题所吓倒，而是勤奋学习，勇于探索。他运用各种仪器设备、试剂，经常一个人闷在化验室里反复试验，不知度过多少个不眠之夜。他按一定程序整理出小卡片，从最简单的试验方法和化验步骤学起，一步一步攀登。每当开会和公出时，他总是把业务书籍带上，无论是在候车室，还是招待所，都坚持学习，并记下了几十万字学习笔记。
    功夫不负有心人。辛勤的汗水换来了丰硕成果。一九八八年他撰写的《未爆炸管理方法》一文发表在《前进报》军械专版上，今年初撰写的《弹药化试验改革与探讨》在军械维修工程杂志上刊登。最近，他又和同志们一道研究了弹药化验中运用液相色谱试验新方法，向着更科学的领域迈进。
    回顾二十八年的军旅生活，他深情地说：“是党把我培养成为一名军队干部，我要像雷锋那样，一心一意为党工作，不为名利，甘愿奉献。我的追求是事业。”
