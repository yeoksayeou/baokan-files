Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 9th.

The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation recently issued a notice, strictly prohibiting foreigners from using RMB to purchase goods in mainland China for export.

The notice states that in recent times, some foreigners, especially those from Hong Kong and Macau, have used illegal means to exchange foreign currency into RMB within China's borders. They then purchase goods in mainland China and collude with some foreign trade companies or lawless individuals to utilize China's export quotas and permits. These companies or individuals, for a fee, handle the customs clearance for the exports on behalf of the foreigners. This practice severely violates China's foreign exchange and export management regulations. It not only disrupts the normal supply of export goods and overseas sales channels but also causes the loss of foreign exchange that should be collected by the state, resulting in national losses. Additionally, it corrupts some foreign trade personnel, and the nature of this behavior is extremely malicious.

To safeguard national interests and uphold discipline, the following is notified:

1. It is strictly prohibited for any foreigner (including those from Hong Kong and Macau and overseas Chinese-funded enterprises) to use RMB to purchase goods in mainland China for export. Domestic units and individuals are not allowed to provide goods directly to foreigners for purchase.

2. It is strictly prohibited for any unit or individual to engage in the illegal buying and selling of export quotas and permits, or to handle customs clearance for foreigners.

3. For foreign-invested production enterprises facing temporary difficulties in balancing foreign exchange receipts and payments, applications to purchase domestic products should strictly follow the "Measures for Foreign-Invested Enterprises to Purchase Domestic Products for Export to Balance Foreign Exchange Receipts and Payments" issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.

Foreigners who violate the above regulations will be notified by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to relevant foreign trade companies to cease all economic and trade activities with them. For domestic units and individuals involved, in addition to necessary administrative penalties, those with serious offenses will be handed over to judicial authorities for handling.

    经贸部发出通知
    严禁外商使用人民币在内地收购商品出口
    新华社北京10月9日电  对外经济贸易部近日发出通知，严禁外商用人民币在我国内地收购商品出口。
    通知指出，近一个时期以来，少数外商，特别是港澳商人，以非法手段在我境内将外汇倒卖成人民币，然后再在内地收购商品，与少数外贸公司或不法人员相勾结，利用我出口配额和许可证，由我外贸公司或不法人员有偿为其报关出口。这种做法，严重违反了我国外汇和出口管理法规，不仅干扰了我国正常出口货源供应及海外经销渠道，而且本应由国家收取的外汇白白流失，使国家蒙受损失，同时也腐蚀了少数外贸工作人员，性质极其恶劣。
    为维护国家利益，严肃法纪，特通知如下：
    一、严禁任何外商（包括港澳商人和境外的中资企业，下同）用人民币在我国境内收购商品出口；国内任何单位和个人也不得为外商直接收购提供货源。
    二、严禁任何单位和个人倒买倒卖出口配额和许可证，以及为外商报关出口。
    三、对于外商投资的生产性企业，为解决外汇收支平衡暂时困难，申请购买国内产品者，应严格按经贸部《关于外商投资企业购买国内产品出口解决外汇收支平衡的办法》办理。
    对违反上述规定的外商，经贸部将通知有关外贸公司停止与其进行一切经济贸易往来；对涉及的国内有关单位和个人除进行必要的行政处分外，情节严重的，还将移交司法机关处理。
