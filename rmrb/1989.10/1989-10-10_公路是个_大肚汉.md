Highways Are a "Big Eater"
Anhu Province Department of Transportation Director Jin Mingsheng

Highways are a "big eater." Their appetite is enormous, but due to congenital deficiencies and poor upbringing, they are weak and cannot bear the heavy burden. It seems that they need to increase their food rations, and it would be best to "transfuse blood." If blood cannot be transfused, then it is absolutely necessary not to "draw blood" anymore.

Anhu Province currently has over 28,000 kilometers of highways, 690,000 motor vehicles, and over 10 million bicycles, with a population of 54 million. On average, there are 24 motor vehicles and over 300 bicycles per kilometer of highway, with only about 5 kilometers of highway per 10,000 people. In 1988, we conducted a comprehensive survey of the road network traffic volume, and the network saturation has reached 1.23, exceeding the design capacity by 23%.

To keep the highways barely operational, nearly 20,000 people are permanently stationed on the roads for maintenance. Each year, 50% of the road maintenance fees are used to maintain simple reproduction, which is only a standard of "not starving to death." The good road rate can only be maintained at 60%–70%. Currently, over 5,000 kilometers of asphalt roads are already "overdue for service" and are on the verge of collapse. The hat of being a "dance hall in the middle of the journey from Nanjing to Beijing" is already in hand and may be worn again at any time.

To improve and enhance the technical condition of highways, our province needs an investment of 1.5 billion yuan for highway construction during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, and 2.1 billion yuan during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period. Even if construction is completed according to this plan, by 1995, the tight situation in highway transportation will still be difficult to significantly alleviate. This is a universal problem nationwide and should be highly regarded by the state and the whole society. We follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction to "build more highways" and strive to raise more funds. We also request that the state truly implement a "tilt" policy in terms of financial resources, changing from "drawing blood" to "transfusing blood."

    公路是个“大肚汉”
    安徽省交通厅厅长　金明生
    公路是个“大肚汉”。它的“食量”很大，但由于先天不足，后天不良，体质瘦弱，很难承受沉重的负荷，看来很需要给它增加一点“粮食定量”，最好能“输点血”，输不了“血”，也千万不能再抽“血”。
    安徽现有公路28000多公里，机动车69万辆，自行车上千万辆，人口5400万。平均每公里机动车达24辆，自行车300多辆，每万人仅有公路5公里多。1988年，我们对路网交通量作了全面调查，路网饱和度已达1.23，比设计通过能力超负荷23％。
    为了使公路能勉强维持通车，全省近2万人常年在路上养护，每年拿养路费的50％用于维持简单再生产，这不过是一个“吃不饱，饿不死”的标准，好路率只能维持在60％—70％。现有5000多公里柏油路已经“超期服役”，濒临崩溃边缘。“从南京到北京，中间有个跳舞厅”。这顶“跳舞厅”的帽子，已经拿在手上，随时有可能重新戴上。
    为了改善提高公路的技术状况，我省“七五”期间公路建设需要投资15亿元，“八五”期间需要21亿元。即使照这个规划建成后，到1995年公路运输紧张状况也很难有大的缓解。这在全国具有普遍性，应该引起国家和全社会高度重视。我们遵照邓小平同志“多搞一点公路”的指示，力争多筹措一点资金。我们也请求国家从财力上真正实行“倾斜”政策，变“抽血”为“输血”。
