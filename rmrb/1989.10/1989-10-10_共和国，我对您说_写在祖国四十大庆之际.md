Republic, I speak to you, you have just turned forty. In your prime, gazing at your colorful map, I cannot hold back the tears of a daughter...

In those days, I wandered in a foreign land. Republic, you were the moon in my heart—a warm and enchanting glow, forging an indelible longing within me! Thus, I crossed desolate mountains, wild rivers, bustling obstacles, and the allure of family ties, rushing into your embrace.

In the endless days and nights of mutual dependence, there were red sunsets, white doves, and blue skies, as well as gloom, storms, and thunder. There were flowers under the moon, streams under the bridge, and there were also clashing swords and widespread smoke. There was mutual understanding and tacit harmony, as well as misunderstandings and sorrows. Yet, the world can change dramatically, but the bond between mother and daughter is unbreakable. Though you bear heavy burdens, your demeanor is majestic. Even those with prejudices must acknowledge your worth. Therefore, I love not only your green mountains and clear waters, your vast snowy plains, and countless treasures, but also your unyielding and steadfast spine. If you were to vanish from the earth, the vast East would sink into the abyss. Therefore, I toil for you day and night, and endure the winds and frosts year after year, without complaint...

Republic, in these forty years, you have grown from youth to maturity. You are no longer the image of crude weapons, nor the cold appearance of blue uniforms and gray coats. You no longer have to endure the insult of being called the "sick man of East Asia." You stand proudly on the podium of the United Nations. Your elite and your fruits are spread across the country and the world. Now, when people mention "China," they look up with respect!

Republic, you are not without mistakes. You have sometimes strayed from the path. You emerged from the shackles of feudalism, and the burden of history is heavy. You are still young, and your experiences in creation are yet to be explored. Moreover, around you, there are cunning foxes and wolves lurking. Your brilliant scroll has also left a few strokes of failure, and there were ten years of turmoil. Yet, Republic, I sing of your achievements and lament your setbacks! Failure is the mother of success. You will forever follow the tide of the times and move forward!

The greedy dogs and wolves fear chaos; the treacherous villains suck your milk while cursing their mother. Republic, dust cannot cover your golden essence, and the night cannot block your rising sun. Whether in the past, present, or future, Republic, your robust body can withstand the bites of mosquitoes; your magnificent spirit can withstand the winds from all directions!

Republic, do you know that your magical and magnificent land holds the deep longing of countless descendants of the Yellow Emperor? Even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble, this pure and sincere feeling cannot be extinguished! I have lost my youth, but my heart remains young. Republic, your laughter, your tears, your past, and your future are all my dearest treasures!

Republic, I speak to you—you have just turned forty. My feelings for you are like my first love! I cherish your yesterday filled with both joy and strife, and I look forward to your tomorrow of prosperity, longevity, and rapid progress!

I firmly believe that my beautiful aspirations will bloom like golden roses!

Republic, let us endure the hardships of life together, and let us enjoy the good times together!

    共和国，我对您说
    ——写在祖国四十大庆之际
    陈慧瑛
    共和国，我对您说，您四十岁刚过，在您的不惑之年，仰望您五彩缤纷的版图，我止不住女儿的热泪……
    当年，我在异邦流浪，共和国，您是我心中的月亮——那一派温馨迷人的光辉，铸就我挥之不去的思念！于是我越过荒山、越过野水，越过繁华的障碍和亲情的诱惑，奔向您的怀抱。
    在互为依存的漫漫日月里，有红霞、白鸽、蓝天，也有阴霾、风暴、雷电；有花前月下小桥流水，也有金戈铁马遍地狼烟；有两情相知悠然默契，也有误解和忧伤。然而，世界可以天翻地覆，母女之间血脉相连，至情不变。您虽如牛负重但器宇轩昂，连那些怀有偏见的人也得刮目相看。因此，我远远不止爱您黄土地上的绿水青山，茫茫雪原万千生灵万千宝藏，我更爱您顶天立地不卑不亢不屈不挠的脊梁，如果地球上失去您，那莽莽东方将陆沉一片。因此，我为您朝朝暮暮默默耕耘，我为您岁岁年年尝遍风霜，无怨无悔……
    共和国，40年间，您从稚嫩走向成熟，再不是土枪土炮的模样，再不是蓝制服灰大褂的清寒，再不必忍受“东亚病夫”的恶谥，您堂堂皇皇走上联合国讲坛。您的精英、您的果实，遍布神州遍布世界，如今提起“中华”，举世都要抬头仰望！
    共和国，您不是没有失误，您也曾偶入歧途，您从封建的旧轭中走出，因袭的历史过于沉重；您还年轻，创造的经验有待开拓。而且，在您的四周，还有居心叵测的狐鼠，还有虎视眈眈的野兽。您那光辉灿烂的画卷，也曾留下一抹两抹的败笔，也曾有十年的动乱。然而共和国，我为您的成就讴歌，我为您的挫折扼腕！失败是成功之母，您永远追随时代的大潮向前！
    觊觎的鹰犬，唯恐天下不乱；奸诈的小人，边吮吸您的乳汁边骂亲娘。共和国，灰尘掩盖不了您黄金的本色，黑夜遮挡不住您旭日的光芒。无论从前、现在或将来，共和国，您健壮的躯体足以抵御蚊蝇的咬噬；您雄伟的气魄足以扛住八面来风！
    共和国，您可知道，您那神奇壮丽的土地，拥有多少炎黄赤子刻骨铭心的相思？纵使海枯石烂，也泯灭不了这纯真挚朴的情感！我已丢失了青春，但我的心依然年轻，共和国，您的欢笑，您的泪水，您的过去，您的未来，都是我心中的至爱！
    共和国，我对您说——您刚过40岁，我对您的感情，一如初恋！我珍惜您有莺歌燕舞也有刀光剑影的昨日，我期待您国富民强、人寿年丰、电光石火的明天！
    我深信我美好的憧憬会像金色的蔷薇含苞怒放！
    共和国，让我们共历人世艰辛，让我们同享花好月圆！
