This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and it is also the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and some Eastern European countries. Reviewing the development of relations between China and some Eastern European countries over the past 40 years, we can see that the friendly cooperative relations established and developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence not only serve the interests of China and Eastern European countries but also contribute to world peace and development.

During the Second World War, the Chinese people established friendship with the peoples of various Eastern European countries. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic successively established diplomatic relations with China in October 1949, which undoubtedly provided strong support and encouragement for the young People's Republic of China.

In the 1950s, the friendly cooperative relations between China and Eastern European socialist countries were in a period of comprehensive development. Party and government leaders frequently visited each other, and mutual support, understanding, and trust were evident on major issues. Cooperation in various fields such as politics, economy, and culture between the two sides developed significantly. Under the historical conditions of that time, this played a major role in consolidating the newly established socialist regime in China, opposing imperialist blockade, and restoring and developing the national economy ravaged by war, and conducting independent and autonomous diplomatic work.

From the 1960s to the 1970s, due to various reasons, the relations between China and some Eastern European countries were in a state of stagnation. Since the 1970s, China's relations with Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria have gradually improved, and in recent years, there have been new developments.

Since 1986, China has signed long-term economic, trade, and technological cooperation development guidelines with the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria until the year 2000, as well as long-term trade agreements for 1986-1990. Bilateral economic and trade cooperation committees have been established with the aforementioned countries, and economic cooperation and trade volumes between the two sides have increased. Cooperation and exchanges in the fields of science and technology, culture, and others have also been satisfactory. High-level leaders from both sides have successfully visited each other, further deepening the understanding and trust between China and these countries, and promoting bilateral relations into a new period.

Over the past 40 years, Eastern European countries have achieved remarkable achievements in socialist construction and accumulated rich experience. Currently, they are exploring development paths suitable for their national conditions. China is willing to exchange experiences with them on socialist construction and development issues, respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, and strengthen cooperation.

Eastern European countries have consistently adhered to the just position of recognizing only one China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China. They have also made unremitting efforts to restore China's lawful seat in the United Nations, for which the Chinese people will never forget.

It can be believed that with the joint efforts of both sides, the relations between China and Eastern European countries will be developed and maintained for a long time on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. May the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Eastern European countries last forever.

    中国同东欧一些国家建交40周年
    陆文
    今年是中华人民共和国建国40周年，也是中国同东欧一些国家建交40周年。回顾40年来中国同东欧一些国家关系发展所走过的道路，可以看到，在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立和发展起来的这种友好合作关系，不仅符合中国和东欧国家的利益，也有利于世界和平与发展。
    早在第二次世界大战期间，中国人民就同东欧各国人民建立了友谊。中华人民共和国诞生后，保加利亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、民主德国于1949年10月相继同我国建立了外交关系，这对年轻的中华人民共和国无疑是有力的支持和鼓舞。
    50年代，中国同东欧社会主义国家的友好合作关系处于全面发展时期。党政领导人互访频繁，在重大问题上相互支持，相互理解，相互信任。双方在政治、经济、文化等各方面的合作关系都有很大的发展。在当时的历史条件下，这对我国巩固新生的社会主义政权，反对帝国主义的封锁，恢复和发展饱受战争创伤的国民经济，开展独立自主的外交工作都起了重大的作用。
    从60年代到70年代，由于种种原因，中国同东欧一些国家的关系处于停滞状态。70年代以来，中国同波兰、民主德国、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚的关系开始逐步恢复，近几年又有了新的发展。
    1986年以来，中国同民主德国、匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚等国分别签订了至2000年的长期经济、贸易和科技合作发展纲要及1986—1990年长期贸易协定，同上述各国先后建立了双边的经济贸易科技合作委员会，双方的经济合作发展，贸易额增长；在科技、文化等领域也进行了令人满意的合作与交流。双方高级领导人相互进行了成功的访问，进一步加深了中国同这些国家之间的理解和信任，推动双边关系进入了一个新时期。
    40年来，东欧各国在社会主义建设中取得了显著的成就，积累了丰富的经验。目前，它们都在探索适合本国国情的发展道路。中国愿意在社会主义建设和发展问题上同它们交流经验，相互尊重，求同存异，加强合作。
    东欧国家一贯坚持只承认一个中国、台湾是中华人民共和国不可分割的组成部分的正义立场，并且为恢复中国在联合国的合法席位做过不懈的努力，对此，中国人民将永志不忘。
    可以相信，在双方的共同努力下，中国同东欧各国的关系会在和平共处五项原则的基础上长期、持续地得到发展。祝中国同东欧各国人民之间的友谊万古长青。
