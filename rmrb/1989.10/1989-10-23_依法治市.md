Jincheng City in Shanxi Province is located at the southern end of the Taihang Mountains, guarding the border between Shanxi and Henan. It is a crucial transportation hub in southern Shanxi, with railways running north and south and highways in all directions.

In recent years, Jincheng City has introduced legal mechanisms into social and economic life, striving to create a good social environment to ensure the sustained and stable development of reform, opening up, and economic construction. In 1988, Jincheng City completed and exceeded its main economic indicators. In the first half of this year, the city's total industrial output value increased by 14.65%, and local financial revenue increased by 40.33%. During the period of turmoil and riots in Beijing and other places, Jincheng City maintained normal production and living order, with a stable situation and almost no impact.

Starting with a Box of Matches

Once, an individual store arbitrarily raised the price of matches and was fined 50 yuan. As soon as the inspectors left, the store owner resumed selling at high prices and openly declared that he would make up for the fine. After receiving a report from the public, the price and commerce departments imposed heavy fines on the store and ordered it to suspend operations for rectification.

Using a box of matches as a topic, Jincheng City organized individual business operators to study and discuss legal and policy provisions such as the "Tax Law," enhancing their legal and professional ethics awareness. Individual business operators voluntarily abide by laws and regulations, operate legally, provide quality services, and promote the improvement of market order.

As a newly built city, Jincheng has a large urban construction task, which touches on a very sensitive issue: land. In recent years, non-production construction land in Jincheng City has exceeded 10,000 mu annually. In rural areas, a "construction boom" has arisen, with under-reporting, over-occupying, unauthorized occupation, and serious illegal land occupation.

After 1987, the Jincheng City government organized forces to conduct a detailed investigation of land use for construction throughout the city. According to the law, 127 state units and nearly 2,000 enterprises were investigated and dealt with, and the results were published in newspapers and on the radio. Regarding the farmers' "construction boom," relevant departments went to the countryside with the law, stayed in farmers' homes, and adopted methods such as legal lectures, discussion meetings, and legal consultations to solve problems from the root. For a small number of "nail households" and "difficult households," the judicial and public security organs forcibly demolished their structures and imposed economic fines. Over the past few years, Jincheng City has legally investigated and dealt with 88 grassroots cadres, reclaiming nearly 1,000 mu of illegally occupied land. Farmers' land occupation for housing construction has been effectively controlled, and urban construction land is strictly limited within the plan.

Eyes of Vigilance Everywhere

At 1:00 AM on June 16, the public security organs of Jincheng City learned that Wang Xinxiong, a key figure in the provincial capital's turmoil and a deputy professor at a certain university, had fled back to his hometown in Lingchuan County. They immediately made detailed arrangements. Half an hour later, public security personnel and local security forces began a detailed search of places where he might be hiding. At around 6:00 AM, in Hexi Middle School in Gaoping County, Wang Xinxiong was cornered in his sister's home.

In Jincheng City, there are vigilant eyes everywhere.

One night in July, the patrol team in the city area found a young man acting suspiciously at the station hotel. After careful interrogation, it was found that he was an illegal element who had fled from another place, spreading rumors in the hotel and forcibly molesting the service staff. The patrol team immediately handed him over to the public security organs.

Now, Jincheng City's security forces have grown to 5,152 units and more than 30,000 people. In recent years, Jincheng City has maintained good social order and people's lives are stable. This is permeated with the sweat and dedication of this mass prevention and control army.

In this team, the elderly, women, and children, through anti-gambling associations, moral appraisal committees, and security patrol teams, have played a unique role. This year, the number of mass gambling cases in the city has decreased by 34.7% compared to the same period last year.

The "Elderly Cadres Social Security Patrol Team" composed of 68 retired and retired cadres in Lingchuan County is responsible for the security management of the county town, market management, and mediation of disputes. Since this year, they have discovered and apprehended 17 criminals, assisted in handling more than 30 various security cases, and won the praise of the people.

Mass prevention and control, on the one hand, makes up for the shortage of public security personnel, and on the other hand, enhances the people's sense of security. Since last year, the professional patrol team alone has apprehended 1,126 criminals, solved 244 cases of various types, and recovered economic losses of more than 620,000 yuan for the state. In the past three years, the crime rate in Jincheng City has been on a downward trend, and the mass prevention and control forces have played an important role.

Not long ago, in the process of apprehending those involved in turmoil or riot crimes, the public security organs of Jincheng City combined roadblocks, stakeouts, key inspections, and concentrated, rapid arrests, and 28 criminals were caught without exception. Among them were some leaders of illegal organizations and key figures in the turmoil who were wanted by the Ministry of Public Security and the Provincial Public Security Department.

Governance by Law and Legal Operations

In September 1987, the Jincheng City government was the first to hire legal consultants to provide reliable legal basis for the government's economic decisions, administrative decisions, and institutional management. By the end of 1988, all government agencies and functional departments at the township level and above had hired legal consultants. A legal operation "atmosphere" has been formed throughout the city. In three years, legal consultants at the municipal and county levels have participated in municipal management, enterprise contracting, foreign trade, environmental protection, and more than ten aspects of administrative decisions. On behalf of the government, they participated in litigation and non-litigation activities, helping to avoid and recover economic losses of more than 30 million yuan.

The "atmosphere" of legal operations has formed and influenced Jincheng City's "microclimate." In April of this year, Jincheng City recruited 398 officials from society, and the recruitment policy, conditions, number, scores, and admission results were published in newspapers and on the radio. More than 200 backdoor letters and more than 300 visitors who came to greet them all lost their effectiveness in the face of "publicity."

For a long time, there has been a problem in Jincheng City's economic life: on the one hand, some enterprises have accumulated funds, and on the other hand, enterprises with marketable products lack funds, affecting production. To ease the financial supply and demand contradictions in the city, Jincheng City established a special agency to legally collect loans, clear overdue loans, unreasonably occupy loans, adjust the credit structure, and implement key investments. In half a year, the financial and judicial departments worked together to recover overdue loans worth 82.08 million yuan.

Collecting personal income adjustment tax is a new task, and both the public and the tax department staff find it difficult to work. Since this year, the tax department has organized forces to investigate and survey the production and circulation sectors according to policies and regulations, without missing any tax source. At the same time, the relevant laws were widely publicized throughout the city to create a strong atmosphere, prompting taxpayers to voluntarily declare and cooperate with the work. This year, the city's task of collecting 400,000 yuan in personal income adjustment tax was completed by mid-August.

　　依法治市
　　李金斗　马小林
    山西省晋城市，地处太行山南端，扼守晋豫边界，铁路贯穿南北，公路四通八达。是山西省南部的对外交通枢纽。
    近年来，晋城市将法律机制引入到社会生活和经济生活中，努力创造良好的社会环境，使改革、开放和经济建设得以持续、稳定发展。1988年，晋城市主要经济指标都完成和超额完成了计划。今年上半年，全市工业生产总值增长14.65％，地方财政收入增长40.33％。在北京等地发生动乱和暴乱期间，晋城市始终保持着正常的生产和生活秩序，大局稳定，基本上没有受到影响。
    从一盒火柴说起
    一次，一家个体商店擅自提高火柴价格被罚款50元，检查人员刚走，店主又卖起了高价，并公开叫嚷要把罚款捞回来。接到群众举报后，物价、工商部门对这家小店处以重罚并令其停业整顿。
    以一盒火柴为话题，晋城市组织个体工商经营者学习讨论《税法》等法律政策条文，增强法制观念和职业道德观念。个体工商户自觉遵纪守法，依法经营，优质服务，促进了市场秩序的好转。
    作为一个新建城市，晋城市城市建设任务比较大，这就触动到一个十分敏感的问题：土地。这几年，晋城市每年非生产性建设占地都在一万亩以上，农村中兴起“建房热”，少批多占，不批抢占，违法占地现象严重。
    1987年以后，晋城市政府组织力量，对全市建设占地进行了详细调查。依照法律对127个国家单位和近2000家企业进行了查处，并将处理结果在报刊、电台“曝光”。针对农民的“建房热”，有关部门携法下乡，蹲点农户，采取上法律课，开讨论会，举办法律咨询等形式，从思想上解决问题。对极少数“钉子户”、“困难户”，由政法机关强制拆除，并处经济罚款。几年来，晋城市对88名基层干部依法进行了查处，收回非法占地近千亩。农户建房占地得到有效控制，城市建设用地严格限制在计划以内。
    到处是警惕的眼睛
    今年6月16日凌晨一时许，晋城市公安机关获悉，制造省城动乱的骨干分子、某大学副教授王新龙潜逃回原籍陵川县，迅即作了周密部署。半小时后，公安人员和当地治安队伍对其可能落脚的地方开始了详细的搜查。六时许，在高平县河西中学，将王新龙围堵在其妹妹家中。
    在晋城市，到处都是警惕的眼睛。
    今年7月的一个深夜，市区巡逻队在车站旅店发现一男青年神色慌张。仔细盘查，得知其真实身份是从外地流窜来的不法分子，在旅店大肆散布谣言，对服务员强行非礼，巡逻队当即将其送交公安机关。
    现在，晋城市的治安队伍已发展壮大到5152个，3万余人。近年来，晋城市始终保持着良好的社会治安秩序，人民生活安定。其中浸透了这支群防群治大军的汗水和奉献。
    在这支队伍里，老人、妇女、儿童通过禁赌协会，道德评议会和治安巡视队，发挥了独特的作用。今年全市聚众赌博案件比去年同期减少34.7％。
    陵川县由68名离、退休老干部组成的“老干部社会治安巡视队”，承担县城治安管理、市场管理，调解纠纷等义务。今年以来，他们发现和抓获犯罪分子17名，协助处理各种治安案件30余起，赢得群众的交口称赞。
    群防群治，一方面弥补了公安机关人手不足，一方面增强了群众的安全感。去年以来，仅专业巡逻队就抓获犯罪分子1126名，破获各类案件244件，为国家挽回经济损失62万多元，近3年来，晋城市刑事案件发案率一直呈下降趋势，群防队伍起了重要作用。
    不久前，在缉拿参与动乱或暴乱犯罪分子的过程中，晋城市公安机关把设卡堵截、蹲点守候、重点清查与集中，快速抓捕结合起来，28名罪犯无一漏网。其中包括一些公安部和省公安厅通缉的非法组织头头和动乱骨干分子。
    依法行政　依法办事
    1987年9月，晋城市政府率先聘请了法律顾问，为政府的经济决策、行政决策和制度管理提供可靠的法律依据。到1988年底，乡镇以上各级政府及其职能部门全部聘请了法律顾问。在全市形成了一个依法办事的“氛围”。3年里，市、县两级政府法律顾问参与了市政管理、企业承包、对外贸易、环境保护等十多个方面的政务决策。受政府委托参加诉讼和非诉讼活动，帮助避免和挽回经济损失3000多万元。
    依法办事的“氛围”，形成和影响着晋城市的“小气候”。今年4月份，晋城市从社会上招聘398名干部，招聘政策、条件、数额、分数、录取结果在报纸、电台公布，200多张后门条子，300多上门打招呼者，都在“公开性”面前失去了效能。
    长期以来，晋城市经济生活中存在着这样一个问题，一方面是部分企业资金积压，一方面是产品适销对路的企业资金缺乏，影响生产。为了缓解全市的资金供求矛盾，晋城市成立专门机构，依法收贷，清收拖欠贷款、不合理占用贷款，调整信贷结构，实行重点投入。半年时间，金融、司法部门联合工作，收回逾期贷款8208万元。
    征收个人收入调节税是件新工作，不仅群众生疏，就连税务部门的同志也感到工作有难度。今年以来，税务部门根据政策法规，组织力量对生产和流通领域调查摸底，不放过任何一个税源。同时，在全市广泛宣传有关法律，大造声势，促使纳税义务人员主动申报，配合工作。今年，全市下达个人收入调节税40万元的任务，到8月中旬全部完成。
