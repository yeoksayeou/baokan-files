	The "Little Tiger" Underground
		Chen Dengming
		Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Weifu

	He had just come up from the mine, covered in mud and dirt, with a broad, innocent smile on his face. He is tall and muscular. He is Chen Dengming, the leader of the Tiger Tunnel Team at Huabei Coal Mine, a renowned "Little Tiger" in the national coal industry.

	Chen Dengming came to this team as a worker at the age of 21. He is strong and hardworking, never missing a day of work. Underground, he often drops the pneumatic drill to operate the rock loader, and then pushes the coal cart, never resting for a moment. Pushing coal carts, the team is arranged for two people to push one cart, but he volunteers to push one cart alone; three people lifting a roof beam, he carries it alone; cutting the roof, while others cut seven or eight in a shift, he cuts more than 20. Every day, he goes down in dry clothes and comes up in wet clothes, with sweat pouring like rain into his boots. Therefore, everyone gave him the nickname "Little Tiger."

	Over the past 18 years, the "Little Tiger" has successively served as a squad leader, deputy team leader, and team leader. He has been awarded the title of labor model in Huabei City, Anhui Province, and the national coal industry multiple times. In April last year, he was elected as a representative of the Seventh National People's Congress, and recently he was awarded the title of national labor model. His position has risen, and his honors have increased, but his spirit remains unchanged, still maintaining the essence of the working class.

	He often says, "A leader, a leader, should take the lead; if the leader can endure hardship, the workers will be convinced." He insists on working alongside the team every day. Sometimes, when other leaders in the team are out on business, he voluntarily takes on the work of two shifts. When encountering dangerous tasks, he always takes the lead. Once, during construction at the South Tunnel of Juxianzhuang Mine, the geological conditions suddenly changed, causing a roof fall of several dozen meters and a water inflow of more than 30 tons per hour. If the tunnel was not repaired in time, it could collapse at any moment. At this critical moment, Chen Dengming, without hesitation, found a relatively safe angle based on his experience, and rushed forward despite the falling rocks. Another time, during construction at the West II Mining Area of Linhuang Mine, due to the steep slope and long distance of the incline tunnel, climbing up the slope once would make a person's legs weak. The "Little Tiger" roared again, directing everyone on the spot to overcome difficulties, sometimes climbing up and down seven or eight times a day. In less than four months of construction, his rubber boots were worn out 12 times.

	The "Little Tiger" not only has the spirit of hard work but also the spirit of perseverance. Originally, his cultural level was not high, and he couldn't even read construction drawings. He seized every opportunity to learn, studying professional books such as "Mine Tunnel Engineering" day and night; after becoming a team leader, he also studied scientific management knowledge. Now, he is recognized as an authority on tunneling technology in the team. The "Little Tiger" led the entire team to master 13 new tunneling technologies and techniques; he also created the "double-cycle work method," promoting scientific management of construction and technology, greatly improving production efficiency. The team reduced its personnel by 50%, but the "advance" increased year by year. This team has consecutively won the national-level team title for 12 years.

	Where does the "Little Tiger" get so much energy? I asked him. He replied, "Actually, there's nothing special. I just think about drilling wells quickly, drilling them well, producing coal early and more, to better support national construction." These simple words are firm and resolute, expressing the "Little Tiger's" ideals and pursuits, as well as his lofty spiritual realm.

    井下“小老虎”
　　陈登明
    新华社记者　刘谓福
    他刚从井下上来，一身泥水，满脸憨笑。大个儿，大块头儿。他就是陈登明，淮北煤矿猛虎掘进队队长，全国煤炭战线闻名的“小老虎”。
    陈登明21岁来到这个队当工人。他体壮力大，更不惜力，月月出满勤。在井下，他常常是丢下风钻就去开扒矸机，丢下扒矸机就去推矿车，一刻也不闲着。推矿车，队里安排是两人推一辆，他主动要求一人推一辆；三人合抬的棚梁，他一人扛起就走；砍棚子，别人一班只砍七八个，他一班就砍20多个。他每天都是一身干衣服下去，一身湿衣服上来，流淌的汗水就像雨珠似地灌进长统靴。因此，大家便送他一个“小老虎”的美称。
    十八年来，“小老虎”先后当了班长、副队长、队长，多次被评为淮北市、安徽省、全国煤炭系统劳动模范，去年4月被选为第七届全国人大代表，最近又被评为全国劳动模范。他职务升了，荣誉多了，但那股“虎劲”没有变，仍然保持着工人阶级本色。
    他常说：“干部，干部，就要先走一步；干部能吃苦，工人才心服。”他天天坚持跟班劳动。有时队里其他干部因事外出，他就主动一人跟两班。遇到危险的活，他总是冲在最前面。有一次在朱仙庄矿南大巷施工，地质情况突然变化，“冒顶”几十米，并伴有每小时30多吨的淋水，如果不及时抢修，大巷随时都有塌掉的危险。这时，陈登明二话没说，凭经验找了个比较安全的角度，顶着哗哗掉落的矸石冲了上去。又有一次，在临涣矿西二采区施工，由于斜巷坡度大，距离长，爬一趟上坡，人就累得腿发软。“小老虎”再振虎威，天天在现场指挥大家攻难关，有时一天要爬上爬下七八趟。在不到四个月的施工期间，他的胶靴磨坏12双。
    “小老虎”不光有股拚劲，还有股钻劲。他原来文化水平不高，连施工图纸都看不懂。他利用一切机会学文化，废寝忘食攻读《井巷工程》等专业书籍；当了队干部后，又学习科学管理知识。现在，他是队里公认的掘进技术权威。“小老虎”带领全队熟练掌握了13种掘进新技术、新工艺；还首创“双循环工作法”，促进施工管理、技术管理科学化，大大提高了生产效率。全队人员减少50％，而“进尺”却年年提高。这个队已连续12年蝉联国家等级队。
    “小老虎”哪来这么大的劲？我问他。他答道：“其实也没啥。俺只是想着快打井，打好井，早出煤，多出煤，好支援国家建设。”这朴实的话语，字字掷地有声，道出了“小老虎”的理想和追求，也道出了他的崇高的精神境界。
