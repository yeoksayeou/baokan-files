The practice of "public banquets" that harm public interests for personal gain has finally been curbed to some extent. However, in some places, "home banquets" have become more frequent. A village party secretary, for instance, hosted more than 10 banquets at his home in just one month, spending 800 yuan. Those who know the inside story say that these "home banquets" are actually a variant of "public banquets," a new strategy employed by those who are greedy, accustomed to feasting, and firmly believe that not eating is a waste. They clearly use public funds but invite guests to their homes, creating the appearance of personal spending, making it difficult to audit. These "home banquets" are often held at the homes of leaders or their close associates within units or enterprises. They first purchase items at the market and then obtain invoices from elsewhere for items of similar value (the principle being that they must be reimbursable and undetectable by audits). Falsifying invoices and accounts requires giving substantial "tips"; moreover, since the banquets are held at home, the entire family benefits. In this way, "home banquets" end up costing more than "public banquets."

The rise of "home banquets" is also related to the guests. Some people, fully aware that the public is footing the bill, justify it as a matter of "personal sentiment" because it is held at someone's home. They can satisfy their taste buds and gain a reputation for being "clean." Thus, some individuals, when going out to inspect or accept work, insist on attending "home banquets"!

No matter how the banquet culture blows, it always targets public funds. On this point, it is consistent. Since this "home banquet" practice has just begun to surface, it is important to expose it promptly to prevent its spread.

    制止“公宴家吃”
    陈西峰
    损公利己的“公宴”风终于有所收敛了。但是，有些地方“家宴”却多了起来。某村支书，近一个月在家宴请了10多桌，花款800元。了解内情的人说，这些“家宴”其实是“公宴”的变种，是那些吃馋了、吃惯了、笃信不吃白不吃的人的新对策，值得人们注意。明明是公家掏钱，却要把客人请到家里，摆出个人掏腰包的样子，让人没法检查。这种“家宴”，往往安排在单位、企业的领导或其亲信家里。他们先在集市上采购，再从别处开来价值差不多的发票（以能报销、且审计不出来为原则）。开假发票、做假账都需要给相当的“好处”；又因为在家里做饭，请一个人全家沾光。这样算来，“家宴”比“公宴”花钱更多，更厉害。
    “家宴”的兴盛，与被请者有关。一些人，明明心里知道是公家出钱，但因为在家里，就可说成是“个人感情”。既能饱其口福，又能捞“清廉”之名。于是，个别人下去检查、验收，还非“家宴”不赴呢！
    宴请风无论怎么刮，总是朝着公家下手，在这一点上是万变不离其宗的。趁这种“家宴”刚露端倪，应及时把它拿出来“曝光”，以制止它的蔓延。
