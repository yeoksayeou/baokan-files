The statue of Hans Hieber, a world-renowned journalist and internationalist warrior who shed his blood in the Stirmong Mountains to resist the Japanese invaders, was unveiled today at the Martyrs' Cemetery of East China in Linyi, Shandong. Huang Hua, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Advisory Commission, and Mrs. Autumn De, Hans Hieber's wife, attended the unveiling ceremony.

The people of the Shandong Anti-Japanese Base affectionately called Hans Hieber the "Foreign Eighth Route Army." Huang Hua praised him as a great international communist warrior who supported the Chinese national liberation cause with his blood and life. Guo Muqi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who had fought alongside him, said he was the first European to don the uniform of the Eighth Route Army, take up arms, and fight to the death against the fascist invaders.

Hans Hieber was born in Krakow (formerly part of Austria, now part of Poland) in 1897. In 1918, he went to Germany and soon joined the German Communist Party. In 1925, he first came to China and began to participate in the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. In 1932 and 1934, he and his wife Autumn De Luxembourg came to China twice to study the Chinese revolution on the ground. He published many articles in American and British newspapers, enthusiastically praising the achievements of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party in their struggle. After the outbreak of the Chinese War of Resistance against Japan in 1937, Hans Hieber used his pen to support the Chinese people's resistance against Japanese aggression. To report on the struggles of the anti-Japanese military and civilians in the hinterland of Shandong, he came to the coastal anti-Japanese base in Shandong as a reporter for the Pacific Society in September 1941, reporting the true situation of the Chinese people's resistance against the Japanese invaders. On November 30, 1941, Hans Hieber, along with the East China Bureau and the Shandong Wartime Work Committee, moved to Dazheng Mountain in Yinan County and encountered the Japanese army. He took up arms and fought against the enemy alongside the troops, but unfortunately, he was fatally wounded. He was 44 years old.
