The first tourist cableway in Northwest China was officially put into operation on October 20 in Lanzhou City. The cableway, 1,258 meters long, stretches between the scenic spots of Gaolan Mountain Forest Park and Wuqing Mountain Park in Lanzhou City.

Both Wuqing Mountain and Gaolan Mountain are famous mountains in Northwest China. Wuqing Mountain is located in the urban area, with steep cliffs, bubbling springs, cascading waterfalls, and dense forests. It preserves numerous historical relics from the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Gaolan Mountain, situated above Wuqing Mountain, is the highest peak in Lanzhou City, with an altitude of over 2,000 meters. After decades of afforestation, especially in the past few years, it was developed into a forest park in May 1985. The park features winding paths, terraced trails, and exquisite pavilions. From the top of the mountain, one can overlook the city, with the Yellow River and the bustling streets forming a vibrant landscape.

To facilitate the public and foreign tourists in ascending the mountain for sightseeing, Lanzhou City began constructing the cableway in September 1988. The project was completed just before National Day this year. The cableway has a maximum capacity of 400 passengers per hour, with backup systems for power supply and braking to ensure safety. Previously, it took over two hours to climb the mountain on foot, but now it only takes 17 minutes by cable car.

　　西北启用第一条旅游索道
    新华社兰州十月二十一日电  （实习生路文）我国西北第一条旅游客运索道二十日在兰州市正式启用。这条索道全长一千二百五十八米，凌驾在兰州市著名风景游览区皋兰山山林公园与五泉山公园之间。
    五泉山与皋兰山同是我国西北名山。五泉山地处市区，山间断崖陡立，泉涌瀑挂，乔木蔽天，保留有众多的元、明、清历朝文物古迹。位于五泉山之上的皋兰山则是兰州市最高的山，海拔二千多米。经过解放后几十年特别是近几年的绿化建设，于一九八五年五月营造成为一座山林公园。绿荫丛中山径曲幽，梯道跌宕，亭阁精巧。站在山顶的三台阁鸟瞰市区，黄河、街市组成的绚丽画面尽收眼底。
    为了方便人民群众和中外游客登高游览，兰州市从一九八八年九月动工修建这座索道，于今年国庆前夕全部建成。最大客运能力每小时四百人，其供电、制动部分都配有保障安全的备用系统。以前徒步登山一般两个多小时，现在乘缆车只需十七分钟。
