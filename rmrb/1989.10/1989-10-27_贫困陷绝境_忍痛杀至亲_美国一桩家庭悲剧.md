	Driven to Desperation by Poverty: A Family Tragedy in the U.S.
	By Lù Wényuè

	Homelessness, starvation, and his wife's drug addiction and prostitution ultimately drove 33-year-old Simpson to desperation—he killed his two disabled children with a hunting knife and then attempted suicide.

	This family tragedy occurred on the evening of January 6, 1988, in a homeless shelter in Washington, D.C. The Superior Court of the District of Columbia is currently trying the murder case.

	Simpson admitted to the killings but denied intentionally murdering his two sons, who suffered from cerebral palsy. He said that the harsh realities of life had driven him to a moment of madness.

	The Simpson family is a typical example of the poor and unfortunate families in the United States. Simpson and Vinitta had been living together without marrying. Possibly due to Vinitta's drug addiction, their two sons were born with cerebral palsy and were quadriplegic. Although Simpson worked for a living, his wages were low. To support her drug habit, Vinitta sold everything of value in the house, even her sons' clothes, and eventually resorted to prostitution.

	Unable to pay the rent, the Simpson family was forced to wander from place to place. Eventually, they ended up in an already overcrowded homeless shelter.

	According to testimony from Simpson's neighbors and social workers in court, Simpson had indeed done his best to care for his two disabled sons. He was a loving father. He had sought help from the city government, hoping that the government or a charitable organization would take in his two sons, but his requests were rejected.

　　贫困陷绝境　忍痛杀至亲
　　——美国一桩家庭悲剧
　　陆文岳
    无家可归、忍饥挨饿和自己的妻子吸毒卖淫，终于逼迫33岁的辛普逊走上绝路——亲手用猎刀杀了自己的两个残疾儿，然后自杀未遂。
    这个家庭悲剧是1988年1月6日傍晚在华盛顿市一个无家可归者收容所发生的。华盛顿特区高等法院目前正在审理这桩谋杀案。
    辛普逊对杀人事实供认不讳，但他否认蓄意谋杀两个患有大脑麻痹症的幼儿。他说，残酷的生活现实迫使他一时丧失了理智。
    辛普逊一家是美国那些贫困而又不幸家庭的典型。辛普逊和维妮塔长期同居而未结婚。可能由于维妮塔吸毒，他们的两个儿子都因大脑麻痹而四肢瘫痪。辛普逊虽然干活挣钱，但工资不高。维妮塔为了吸毒，变卖了家中一切值钱的东西，甚至连儿子的衣服都卖了，最后只能靠卖淫度日。
    由于付不起房租，辛普逊一家只好到处流浪，后来他们终于挤进了那所早已人满为患的无家可归者收容所。
    据辛普逊的邻居和社会工作者在法庭上作证，辛普逊对两个残疾儿确实尽了最大的责任，他是一个慈爱的父亲。他曾向市政府求助，希望政府或慈善机构收容他的两个儿子，但遭到拒绝。
