On the night of July 30, 1989, under the cover of darkness, the rugged and seldom-trodden terrain of Wolf Mountain was shrouded in clouds and silence. Suddenly, the echoes of "Long live the Communist Party of China!" and "Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!" reverberated through the mountains, the echoes lingering long after the initial cries. This was the call of the 40 campers from the "Journey Along the Great Wall Path" summer camp of Zhangjiakou Sixth Middle School, echoing the voices of the Five Heroes of Wolf Mountain who had leaped to their deaths 48 years prior. At this moment, the campers' minds were filled with the heroic scenes of the Five Heroes of Wolf Mountain fighting bravely and sacrificing themselves, and the grand banners at the opening ceremony under the ancient Great Wall and the beacon towers in the border city: "Inherit the Revolutionary Tradition" and "Carry Forward the National Spirit"!

Layer upon layer of mountains stirred the patriotic heartstrings.

From Pingxing Pass to the east, to Shanhaiguan, the ancient Great Wall path, which had been set ablaze by the flames of the War of Resistance Against Japan, bore the firm footsteps of the "Journey Along the Great Wall Path" campers.

At the site of the Battle of Pingxing Pass, the campers invited Mr. Zeng Hui, who had served as a battlefield guide for the deputy commander of the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army, Nie Rongzhen, to recount the battle scenes of that time. They climbed hills and crossed valleys to find battle sites, read the reminiscences of Nie Rongzhen and Yang Dezhi, and collected stones and leaves as everlasting mementos.

At the "Ancient North Pass Battle Martyrs Cemetery," where 360 heroic spirits lie buried, the campers invited the former Party Secretary of Ancient North Pass Town, Guan Qingxian, to recount the iron-blooded spirit of the resistance at the Great Wall of Ancient North Pass. They held a memorial ceremony and slowly circled the cemetery nestled by the Great Wall.

At Panjiayu, where the Japanese had committed a horrendous massacre, the campers listened to the blood-curdling cries of survivor Zhang Fengyun. They added fresh soil to the four large graves where men, women, old, and young were buried, and lined up to swear an oath to the old warriors of the "Revenge Team" of Panjiayu: "We vow to be Chinese people without the spirit of servitude!"

At Xifengkou, a famous anti-Japanese site submerged in the Panjiayu Reservoir, the campers gathered white flowers and scattered them on the water, reflecting the pure souls of the heroes. They moved scattered bricks and stones to the crumbling gaps in the city walls, expressing their deep respect for the heroes and their profound love for the motherland. They sang the "March of the Volunteers," making the source of the "March of the Volunteers" resonate with its stirring melody once again.

At Shanhaiguan, known as the "Key to the Two Capitals, Unrivaled Land, the First Pass of the Great Wall," the campers recalled the tragedy of the Japanese waving their national flag and singing their national anthem on the Great Wall. They solemnly unfurled the national flag and, with fervent emotions, sang the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.

At the site of the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Lugou Bridge, the "Journey Along the Great Wall Path" summer camp came to a close. In the grand hall of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Hall by the Lugou Bridge, the giant statue symbolizing the "Flesh-and-Blood Great Wall" and the eight ancient bells symbolizing the "Eight Years of Resistance, the Alarm Bell Rings Long" stirred the campers' blood and left them with surging emotions.

On August 15, at Tiananmen Square, the campers participated in the solemn flag-raising ceremony. They presented a banner embroidered with the Tiananmen image and the words "I Love Tiananmen" to the flag-raising team, and held an enrollment ceremony for seven comrades. Thus, they completed a 27-day journey of over 4,000 miles, visited more than 40 anti-Japanese sites, met nearly 100 revolutionary forerunners, remembered the history of humiliation and disaster of the Chinese nation, and admired the spirit and style of the revolutionary pioneers like the Great Wall. They ignited the noble character and heroic spirit of the Chinese nation!

This school has consistently carried out revolutionary tradition education with the Great Wall as its theme.

Since 1985, they have used the small building where the commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, Nie Rongzhen, worked as the revolutionary tradition education activity room, holding rich and colorful traditional education and photo exhibitions.

Places like the former site of the Cha-Har Peasant Movement Training Institute, the Jihongchang Memorial Hall, the Martyrs' Tower of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and the hometown of Dong Cunrui have all become bases for revolutionary tradition education.

They named the "Haidao Mountain Literary Society" after the majestic Haidao Mountain that ignited the flames of anti-Japanese resistance in North China. They compiled the revolutionary chronicles, wrote articles commemorating the martyrs, and extensively carried out activities of writing reports to revolutionary elders. They have maintained correspondence with more than ten revolutionary elders such as Nie Rongzhen, Yang Dezhi, Yang Chengwu, and Kang Keqing. Last year, with the help of the stationed troops, they organized the "Journey Along the Jing-Zhang Railway" summer camp. The "S" shaped track of Qinglong Bridge stirred the patriotic and nationalistic sentiments of the students.

Why do they love the Great Wall so much? The school leadership analyzed: The Great Wall is the totem of the Chinese nation. Using the wind and rain, the spirit, and the essence of the Great Wall to shape the children under the Great Wall is an educational topic rich in profound patriotic content. Four thousand miles of journey, four thousand miles of emotion.

The new people of the Great Wall Path, every mountain and river are filled with emotion.

On July 27, at the hometown of one of the Five Heroes of Wolf Mountain, Ma Baoyu, in Xiaoyuan Village by the Hulu River, the villagers watched the "Journey Along the Great Wall Path" summer camp members hold a "soil-taking ceremony" in Ma Baoyu's courtyard. They said they wanted to bring the soil to Wolf Mountain, and their hearts trembled. They harnessed their own horses and insisted on sending them off to express the heart of the farmers. At the Hulu River Bridge, the campers and villagers bid farewell. The Party Secretary thoughtfully said, "That autumn, Baoyu also crossed the river from here to join the Eighth Route Army..." The old secretary's words stirred waves of emotions in the campers' hearts: We are walking the same path that Ma Baoyu walked!

The sun shone on the Yellow Earth Ridge, and the campers were about to set off in formation. During the Battle of Yellow Earth Ridge, Chen Yuncai, who served as the militia platoon leader, carried a basket of steaming hot, golden-brown steamed buns to the front of the queue, panting, "Old grandpa has nothing good to give, just a few steamed buns for you to take on the road to fill your stomachs! During the war against the Japanese, our Eighth Route Army's main food was corn and steamed buns!" It turned out that the old man, seeing these little Eighth Route Army members singing "Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention" and helping the villagers carry water and sweep the yard, remembered the old Eighth Route Army... So, he and his wife sifted their coarse flour through a fine sieve, added some sugar, and steamed the buns overnight. When the campers received the steamed buns from the old man, tears rolled down their young, suddenly mature faces.

At the North Beach in Beidaihe, the misty rain and crashing waves stirred the hearts. On the afternoon of August 10, General Yang Chengwu and his wife Zhao Zhizhen, together with the campers, braved the waves and currents... This was after General Yang and his wife had cordially received all the summer camp members. Seeing some campers show fear in the face of the waves, General Yang thought for a moment and said, "We have experienced many storms, and our nation has also faced many storms. Actually, big waves and storms are not scary!" With that, he was the first to dive into the waves. The campers suddenly thought of the words General Yang had just written for the summer camp: "Inherit the revolutionary tradition, carry forward the national spirit," as if the vast sea had become smaller and the towering waves had become lower...

The campers who studied at the former site of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region Command had a special affection for the former Commander Nie. On August 11, Nie's wife, the old Red Army soldier Zhang Ruixua, and his daughter, Major General Nie Li, represented the ailing Nie and cordially received the camper representatives. When the campers were about to leave, 40 fresh, juicy peaches were placed before them. Grandma Zhang smiled and said, "These are from Grandpa, you must take them." The camper representative, with tears streaming down his face, said, "Grandpa Nie is ill, and we didn't bring any gifts, but Grandpa sent peaches to us. Thank you, Grandpa! Thank you, Grandma!" Zhang Ruixua said meaningfully, "Your journey along the Great Wall Path is the greatest comfort to Grandpa who is ill, and it is the best gift you can give to Grandpa."

At midnight on August 18, the summer camp's car was stuck in Huailai County for over five hours. The campers were thirsty and parched. A young man who guarded the orchard heard about it and, without a second thought, ran to his contracted orchard, picked 40 apples in the dark, and wrapped them in his clothes to bring to the campers' car. When the campers offered to pay, he insisted, "For a few dollars, I wouldn't go groping in the dark!" He put down the apples and disappeared into the night. The campers chased after him and asked his name three times before he finally said, "Xu Xiaoshun."

The county magistrate of Lingshou County personally arranged their accommodation, a female teacher from the water library of Miyun County gave them the book "Miyun Clouds," the manager of Panjiayu Reservoir allowed them to board the ship to Xifengkou for free, the staff of Shanhaiguan opened the gate to the old Longtou for them, and six students from Tangshan No. 53 Middle School became their "extraordinary campers"... One after another, these acts were filled with the deep affection of workers, peasants, and soldiers, touching the hearts of every camper.

The arduous 4,000-mile journey, the unforgettable 27 days and nights, made up for a lesson that should have been taught long ago. The school leadership and external instructors felt a sense of relief after completing the long journey, but also a sense of historical weight they had never felt before.

On the way back from Wolf Mountain, the campers discussed Ma Baoyu, Ge Zhenlin, Hu Delin... Suddenly, someone asked, "Who is Hu Delin?" This question deeply wounded the heart of the external instructor and lieutenant colonel, Yuan Baoying: Climbing Wolf Mountain to pay tribute to the Five Heroes, but not knowing their names, while knowing the names of third-rate actors and singers, what does this say? It says that the revolutionary martyrs have not yet found a place in the hearts of some students. Therefore, he suggested that the "Five Heroes of Wolf Mountain" be made honorary campers of the "Journey Along the Great Wall Path" summer camp. Every time the roll is called, the honorary campers are called first, and all campers respond together...

One night, the campers were eating the steamed buns given by Old Man Chen Yuncai from Yellow Earth Ridge. In the darkness, someone threw a steamed bun from the car. Deputy Principal Jia, who was leading the team, felt uncomfortable: The steamed buns contain the sweat of the people of the old revolutionary base areas and their memories of the Eighth Route Army's hard work and struggle! He organized the campers to hold a special discussion on "Memories of the Steamed Bun."

At Yellow Earth Ridge, Old Man Chen Yuncai entrusted the campers to deliver a small bag of yellow corn to Commander Nie. When the campers handed the bag of corn to Commander Nie's wife, she was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes, and she tightly hugged the bag to her chest. Commander Nie's daughter happily said that she would send this bag of corn to the Military Museum. At this moment, some campers' surprised looks contained a hint of disbelief, as if saying, "A bag of corn is worth sending to the museum?" The campers discussed again. An eye expression reflected a value concept. Based on this, they held a discussion on "The Value of a Bag of Corn." From a steamed bun to a bag of corn, the campers' understanding of hard work and struggle was constantly elevated...

During the journey along the Great Wall Path, some contradictions emerged: Some students called revolutionary elders "Grandpa" and "Grandma," but at the same time, they found them "dirty" and did not want to approach or help them; some students, after reading the reminiscences of their predecessors and historical documents, secretly read romantic and murderous novels... The hearts of middle school students are no longer a "blank slate." It is difficult to instill the right things in middle school students, and ideological education lies in perseverance and the long-ringing alarm bell...

The "Journey Along the Great Wall Path" summer camp has ended, but the camp song is still on the lips of the students, and the unyielding national bloodline continues in the song:

The red camp flag flutters in the wind,
Under the majestic Great Wall, it stretches far,
The mountains echo with deep affectionate songs,
The small river records poems of longing.

Journey Along the Great Wall Path, talking about the past,
Inherit the heroic spirit of the predecessors,
We are willing to be the bricks of the Great Wall...

The campers of the "Journey Along the Great Wall Path" summer camp traveled thousands of miles to the old revolutionary base area of Shanxi Province, Luyuan County, Yellow Earth Ridge, to investigate and collect the heroic deeds of that time.

During the investigation at the major war site of Pingxing Pass, Mr. Zeng Hui, who had served as a guide for Commander Nie Rongzhen, introduced the situation of the Eighth Route Army fighting against the Japanese invaders to the summer camp members.  Summer Dejun, photographer.

　　长城古道行
　　——记张家口市第六中学革命传统教育主题夏令营
　　刘鑫  范印华  王顺船
    1989年7月30日，夜幕下山势险峻、人迹罕至的狼牙山，云雾缠腰，一片沉寂。突然，“中国共产党万岁！”“中华民族解放万岁！”的口号声在山中爆响，群山回音，经久不息。这48年前狼牙山五壮士跳崖前留下的声音，是张家口市第六中学“长城古道行”夏令营40名营员集体的呼唤。此刻，营员们的眼前又映现出狼牙山五壮士那痛击敌寇、慷慨赴死的壮景，又映现出在塞外山城古长城烽火台下举行开营式时那两条耀人眼目的巨标：“继承革命传统”、“弘扬民族精神”！
    层峦叠嶂拨动爱国心弦
    从平型关起，东到山海关，被抗战烽火烧红过的长城古道，留下了“长城古道行”营员们坚实的脚步。
    在平型关战役遗址，营员们请曾给八路军115师副师长聂荣臻当战地向导的曾槐老人实地讲述当年的战斗景况，爬坡越沟寻找一处处战斗遗址，朗读聂荣臻、杨得志的回忆文章，采集石块和树叶等实物作为永久的纪念。
    在埋有360具忠骨的“古北口战役阵亡将士公墓”前，营员们请原古北口镇党委书记关清贤追述古北口长城抗战的铁血精神，举行祭奠仪式，围着偎依在长城身边的公墓缓缓地转了一圈又一圈……
    在日寇曾经制造灭绝人性大惨案的潘家峪，营员们现场倾听幸存者张凤云老人的血泪哭诉，围着以男、女、老、幼分葬的四座大坟添上了一捧捧新土，列队向潘家峪“复仇团”老战士发誓：誓做没有奴气的中国人！
    在被淹没于潘家口水库之中的著名抗战遗址喜峰口，营员们采来洁白的鲜花撒向水面，映照英烈圣洁的心灵；搬起散落的砖石垒在坍塌的城墙缺口，表达对英烈崇高的敬意，对祖国深沉的爱心；放歌
  《大刀进行曲》，使大刀颂的发源地又荡响那激昂的旋律。
    在素有“两京锁钥无双地，万里长城第一关”之称的山海关，营员们想起日寇在长城上狂舞日本国旗、狂唱日本国歌的悲剧，庄严地展开国旗，群情激奋地高唱中华人民共和国国歌。
    在抗战爆发地卢沟桥，“长城古道行”夏令营落下了帷幕。卢沟桥畔的中国人民抗日战争纪念馆大厅里，寓意“血肉长城”的巨雕和寓意“八年抗战，警钟长鸣”的八口古钟，使营员们热血鼎沸，心潮难平。
    8月15日，在天安门广场，营员们参加了庄严的升旗仪式，赠送给国旗班一面亲手绣制的带有天安门图案和“我爱北京天安门”字样的锦旗，为7名同学举行了入团仪式。就这样，他们历时27天，行程4000余里，考察了40多个抗战遗址，访问革命先辈近百人，记住了中华民族屈辱和灾难的历史，领略了革命先驱那长城般的风骨和血染的风采，激发了中华民族的磊落气节和干云豪气！
    这所中学坚持以长城为主题的革命传统教育，可谓一以贯之。
    1985年以来，他们以当年晋察冀司令部聂荣臻司令员办公的小楼为革命传统教育活动室，举行丰富多彩的传统教育和图片展览。
    察哈尔农民运动讲习所旧址、吉鸿昌纪念馆、民众抗日同盟军阵亡将士纪念塔、董存瑞的故乡等十几处纪念地，都成为革命传统教育的基地。
    他们以点燃华北抗日烽火的巍巍海陀山命名，创办了“海陀山文学社”，编采革命春秋录，撰写缅怀先烈的文章，还广泛开展给革命长辈写汇报信的活动，同聂荣臻、杨得志、杨成武、康克清等十几位老一辈革命家建立并保持着书信联系。去年，他们在驻军协助下搞了“京张铁道行”夏令营，青龙桥“人”字形线路，拨动着同学们爱国、报国的心弦。
    他们何以如此钟爱长城？学校领导分析：长城是中华民族的图腾，用长城的风雨、长城的风骨、长城的精神，塑造长城脚下的孩子，是一个蕴含着深刻的爱国主义内容的教育课题。四千里征尘四千里情
    长城古道行新人，山山水水都是情。
    7月27日，在狼牙山五壮士之一马宝玉的故乡——壶流河畔下元皂村，乡亲们看着“长城古道行”夏令营营员在马宝玉宅院里举行“取土仪式”，听说要把它带上狼牙山，一颗颗心都颤动了。他们套上自家的马车，说啥也要送一程表表庄稼人的心。壶流河桥头，营员和乡亲们惜别时，党支部书记若有所思地说：“那年秋天，宝玉也是打这里过河参加八路军的……”老书记的话在营员们心中激起层层涟漪：我们走的是一条马宝玉走过的路啊！
    阳光撒满黄土岭，营员们就要整队出发了。在黄土岭战役中担任民兵班长的陈云才老人，端着一簸箕黄澄澄热腾腾的窝窝头赶到队伍面前，喘着粗气说：“老爷爷没啥好送的，送你们几个窝窝头带着路上充饥吧！打鬼子那阵，咱八路军的主食就是小米饭、窝窝头啊！”原来，老人看到这些排着队伍、唱着《三大纪律八项注意》进村，一放下背包就为群众担水、扫院的“小八路”，想起了当年的老八路……于是，他和老伴把自己平常吃的粗面过了一遍细箩，又放上糖精，连夜蒸开了窝窝头，当营员们从老人手中接过窝窝头时，一颗颗泪珠从幼稚又顿显成熟的脸上滚下来。
    北戴河海滨浴场，烟雨苍茫，惊涛拍岸。杨成武将军偕夫人赵志珍，同营员们一起劈波斩浪，中流击水……这是8月10日下午，杨将军和夫人亲切接见了全体夏令营营员后，又把大家带到了浴场。杨将军见有的营员面对风浪露出怯色，稍事沉思后说，我们过来人闯风浪闯得多了，我们民族闯风浪也闯得多了，其实，大风大浪并不可怕！说着，他第一个跃进风浪之中。营员们油然想起杨将军刚刚为夏令营题的词“继承革命传统，发扬民族精神”，仿佛茫茫沧海变小了，滔滔浪峰变低了……
    在晋察冀军区司令部旧址读书的营员们，对当年的聂司令员有特殊的感情。8月11日，聂帅的夫人老红军张瑞华和女儿聂力少将，代表病中的聂帅亲切地接见了营员代表。当营员们准备离去时，40个鲜美的大蜜桃摆到他们面前。张奶奶笑着说，这是爷爷给的，你们一定要收下。营员代表双泪挂腮地说，聂爷爷在病中，我们没带什么礼物，爷爷却把蜜桃送给我们，谢谢爷爷！谢谢奶奶！张瑞华意味深长地说，你们的长城古道行就是对病中的爷爷最大的安慰，就是送给爷爷最好的礼物。
    8月18日午夜，夏令营的车在归途中被堵在怀来县境内5个多小时了，营员们口干舌燥。一个看果园的小伙子听说后，二话没说，跑到自己承包的果园里，摸黑摘了40个苹果，用衣服兜着送到营员们的车上。当营员们要付款时，他执意不肯：“要为那几个钱，俺才不黑灯瞎火地去摸呢！”他放下苹果，转身就消失在夜幕之中。营员们追上去再三询问，他才说出了自己的名字：徐小顺。
    灵丘县马县长亲自为他们安排住宿，密云县水库中学一位女教师赠送他们藏书《密云风云》，潘家口水库管理局长让他们免费乘船到喜峰口，山海关工作人员破例为他们打开了通向老龙头入海处的大门，唐山市53中的6名同学当了他们的“编外营员”……一桩桩，一件件，浸透了工人、农民、士兵的深情，激动着每一个营员的心。
    从未有过的历史沉重感
    艰辛的4000里行程，难忘的27个日日夜夜，补上了一课早就该补的课。校领导和校外辅导员感到了完成长途跋涉后的轻松，又体味到一种从未有过的历史沉重感。
    登狼牙山的归途中，营员们谈论着马宝玉、葛振林、胡德林……突然，有人发问：“胡德林是谁？”这在校外辅导员、少校军官袁宝莹的心里深深地划了一刀：上狼牙山祭奠五壮士，却不知五壮士姓甚名谁，而对那些三流演员、三流歌星，许多人倒背如流，这说明什么？说明革命先烈在一些同学的心里还没有位置。于是，他建议以“狼牙山五壮士”为“长城古道行”夏令营荣誉营员。每当点名时，首先从荣誉营员点起，全体营员共同答“到”……
    一天晚上，营员们正在吃着黄土岭陈云才老人送的窝窝头。黑暗中，不知是谁从车上扔下一个窝窝头。带队的贾副校长心里很不是滋味儿：窝窝头里有老区人民的汗水，有老区人民对八路军艰苦奋斗精神的怀念呵！他组织营员举行“窝窝头的回忆”专题讨论会。
    在黄土岭，陈云祥老人委托营员们把一小袋黄小米转送给聂帅。当营员们把米袋转交给聂帅的夫人时，她激动得热泪盈眶，把米袋紧紧地搂到了怀里。聂帅的女儿高兴地说，要把这袋小米送到军事博物馆。此时，有的营员惊诧的目光中又带有不以为然的神色，好像在说，“一点小米也值得送博物馆？”营员又议论开了。一个眼神反映了一种价值观念。据此，他们开展了“一袋小米的价值”大家谈。从一个窝窝头到一袋小米，营员们对艰苦奋斗的认识在不断地升华……
    在长城古道行中，还出现了一些矛盾现象：有些同学对革命老人一口一个“爷爷”、“奶奶”，同时却又嫌他们“脏”而不愿接近和搀扶；有的同学读罢前辈的回忆文章和历史文献，私下里又捧起言情、凶杀小说……中学生的心灵不复是一张“画什么是什么”的“白纸”了。给中学生灌输点正确的东西太难了，思想教育贵在坚持不懈、警钟长鸣……
      “长城古道行”夏令营结束了，营歌还不时挂在同学们的嘴边，自强不息的民族血脉在歌声中延续着：
    火红的营旗迎风招展，
    巍巍的长城脚下伸延，
    大山回响深情的歌声，
    小河录下思念的诗篇。
    长城古道行，烽火话当年，
    继承先辈英雄志，
    我们愿作长城砖……（附图片）
