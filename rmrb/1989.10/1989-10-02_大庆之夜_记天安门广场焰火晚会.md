A joyous day came to an end, and Beijing welcomed a night of grand celebration.

As night fell, carrying the glow of steel from the furnaces, the fragrance of the fields, and the dust of the anti-riot battles, people from all directions gathered at Tiananmen Square to share a wonderful National Day night.

The solemn "National Anthem" began to play, and 100 cannons fired 28 deafening shots to celebrate the birthday of the Republic, like rolling thunder, like a tidal wave, like an erupting volcano.

Fireworks soared into the sky, and the words "Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation" appeared in fiery red letters above the square. In an instant, 16 searchlights converged at a single point 430 meters high in the night sky, then shone brightly against each other. Above and below the gate tower, countless heads surged. Boom, boom, boom, the cannons roared, and countless fireworks shot into the sky; pop, pop, pop, dazzling fireworks bloomed in the air, then spread out like umbrellas over the earth. In an instant, the sky was filled with colorful clouds, flowers of seven colors—red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. Who holds the colorful ribbons and dances in the sky?

This year's fireworks show was unprecedented. The capital, with Tiananmen Square as its center, had 400 fireworks cannons distributed across nine launch sites, firing tens of thousands of fireworks. Tiananmen Square alone had 126 large cannons, with 160 different types of fireworks, 100 more than during the 35th anniversary celebration.

The first batch of fireworks launched was "Flowers Blooming in Four Seasons." People saw willows swaying and plum blossoms blooming on the sky's canvas, followed by peach and plum blossoms in full bloom, a vivid scene of spring. There were willows by the West Lake, cicadas singing among ripe lychees in the south, and vineyards in full bloom in the north. There were wheat fields stretching to the sky and fragrant rice flowers along the Yellow River and the Great Rivers of the south. The square was filled with workers performing traditional folk performances like "Dragons and Tigers Leaping." Seventeen lions and seven colorful dragons rolled onto the stage, and a 45-meter-long giant dragon danced, symbolizing our great motherland's vitality and prosperity. Farmers from the suburbs danced folk songs and dances like "Harvest Song" and "Peace Drum," expressing their joy and gratitude to the Party for the fruits of reform. ...

The second set of fireworks, "A Splendid Land," ascended into the sky. In an instant, people saw the rising sun, palm trees bathed in morning light, and the Yellow Mountains shrouded in clouds. The fisherman's song from Dongting Lake was vividly painted; flowers bloomed on the mountains, peacocks spread their tails, and phoenixes spread their wings, all in a peaceful and auspicious scene; the vast sea was filled with dancing dragons; the world of jade was covered with flying snow dragons by the millions; the rivers and mountains of the north, south, east, and west of the motherland were all within sight...

Under the fluttering national flag, 5,000 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army danced. Among them were generals and soldiers; there were heroic units like the Red First Division, the Dadu River Company, and the Five Heroes of Wolf Mountain from the past war years, as well as regiments that fought in the Old Mountain Front and those that distinguished themselves in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. Male and female soldiers danced joyful group dances and social dances.

The third set of fireworks was "A Rainbow of Colors," with red azaleas from Shaoshan, mountain danxias from the Loess Plateau, and water spirits, snow lotuses from the Tian Mountains, peonies of national beauty, chrysanthemums defying the frost, and plums blooming in the snow, all blooming in this instant. Before people's eyes was a world of flowers, an ocean of flowers...

More than 10,000 university students from over 80 higher education institutions in the capital, including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Renmin University of China, participated in the celebration with a new look. They marched with vigorous steps, sang with passionate voices, and danced, determined to contribute to the construction of a socialist motherland.

The fourth set of fireworks, "Celebrating Victory," lit up the sky again. At this moment, under the sky filled with blooming flowers and flowing gold, the reveling crowd almost entirely joined in the group dance, pushing the celebration to a new climax.

Tonight, we celebrate National Day with joy. In the great Republic's 40th anniversary celebration, the masses cheer for the growth and strength of the socialist motherland, praise the great achievements of the Communist Party of China, and wish for a more beautiful and prosperous tomorrow for the motherland.

    送走欢乐的白昼，北京迎来狂欢大庆之夜。
    夜幕降临时分，挟着炼钢炉前的钢花，带着田野的芬芳，披着平暴战斗的风尘，人们从四面八方来到天安门广场，共度美好的国庆之夜。
    庄严的《国歌》奏起来了，为共和国祝寿的100门礼炮发出震天动地28响，如惊雷滚滚，如海啸山崩，如火山迸发。
    礼花腾空而起，广场上空出现了“庆祝建国40周年”几个火红的大字。刹那间，16支探照灯升起的巨大光柱在430米的高空汇集一点，然后在夜色中交相辉映。城楼上下，万头攒动。轰隆隆，阵阵炮响，无数礼花弹飞向天空；啪啪啪，璀璨的礼花凌空竞放，然后呈伞状向大地弥漫开来。一时间，天空中出现五彩的云霞，七色的花朵，赤橙黄绿青蓝紫，谁持彩练当空舞？
    今年的焰火晚会盛况空前，首都以天安门广场为中心，400门礼花炮分布在九个施放点，发射数万发礼花炮弹。仅天安门广场就有126门大炮，礼花品种多达160个，比35周年国庆时多了100多种。
    首批施放的礼花是《花开四季》。人们看到，天幕上忽而垂柳依依，迎春花开，忽而桃李争艳，好一幅盎然春意图：有西子湖畔的柳浪闻莺，有南粤的荔熟蝉鸣，还有吐鲁蕃的满园葡萄。有黄河上下，大江南北，麦浪连天，稻花飘香。
    广场上，有工人们演出的大型民间传统节目《龙腾虎跃》，17头狮子和7条彩龙滚地而来，一条45米长的巨龙左右翻动，象征我们伟大的祖国生机勃勃，蒸蒸日上。京郊农民跳起各具特色的民间歌舞《丰收秧歌》、《太平鼓》等，表达了农民在改革年代取得丰硕成果后的喜悦心情和对党的感激之情……

    在迎风飘扬的国旗下载歌载舞的是人民解放军的5000官兵。他们当中既有将军，又有士兵；既有过去战争年代屡建战功的红一师、大渡河连、狼牙山五壮士所在部队等英雄单位，也有在老山前线作战中和平息北京反革命暴乱中立功的连队。男女官兵们跳起了欢快的集体舞、交谊舞。
    第三组礼花是《五彩缤纷》，韶山的红杜鹃，黄土高原的山丹丹，还有凌波仙子、天山雪莲、国色天姿的牡丹、傲霜的秋菊、凌雪的红梅，一齐在这瞬间开放。人们眼前是一片花的世界，花的海洋……
    清华大学、北京大学、北京师范大学、中国人民大学等80多所首都高等院校的1万多名大学生以崭新的风貌，在广场上参加联欢。他们迈着充满活力的步伐，放开热情的歌喉，载歌载舞，决心为建设社会主义祖国作出贡献。
    第四组《欢庆胜利》的礼花又响了。这时，在繁花似锦、流金泻彩的天幕下，狂欢的人们几乎全部跳起了集体舞，把联欢晚会推向新的高潮。
    欢度国庆今宵日，花满首都不夜天。在伟大的共和国40周年大庆之夜，万众欢呼社会主义祖国的成长壮大，歌颂中国共产党的丰功伟绩，祝愿祖国的明天更加妍丽多姿、更加繁荣富强。
