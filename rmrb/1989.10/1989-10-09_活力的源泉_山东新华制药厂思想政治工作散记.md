Shandong New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory has gone through 46 years of history. This factory, known as the "largest antipyretic drug production base in the Far East," and the first enterprise in the national pharmaceutical industry to pass the first-level enterprise evaluation, has shown vigorous vitality and dynamism in the new situation of reform and opening up. More than 5,000 employees of the entire factory, with the "New Hua Spirit" of "politically firm, hardworking, united, and loving the factory as their home," have driven the enterprise to step up to a new level: 18 exported products are all exempt from inspection, and 20 products have won provincial and national awards. In the past year, the factory has been successively rated as a national "May 1st Labor Advanced Collective," a national advanced unit in ideological and political work in the medical system, and an excellent enterprise in national ideological and political work.

**True Gold Shines in the Fire**

From April to June this year, the capital experienced an unusual period from the student movement to turmoil to counter-revolutionary riots, affecting various places across the country.

In mid-May, hundreds of students from Zibo Agricultural Machinery Institute and Zibo Normal Institute marched to the gates of New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory three times, demanding support. They shouted slogans like "New Hua people, go to the streets, if you don't go to the streets, there will be no way out," and pasted and scattered leaflets on the walls, poles, and roads outside the gates of New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory.

Facing the complex situation, the leadership of New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory remained calm. The Party Committee and the factory management used the "April 26th" editorial of the People's Daily to promptly unify the thoughts of the employees, calling on Party members and cadres to maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee and support the Party Central Committee with practical actions.

When the marching crowds frequently appeared at the factory gates, all the employees remained unmoved. Under the leadership of the Youth League Committee, more than 400 young people voluntarily organized a volunteer protection team. When the marching crowds dispersed, the employees quickly took action to remove the leaflets. During this period, 33 employees submitted applications to join the Party, expressing their belief in the Party's leadership and their determination to maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee.

At the end of May, when the dark clouds pressed down, General Manager He Duanshi was in Italy attending the "World Popular Medicine Association Conference." He Duanshi could not hear the voices from Beijing, but the anti-China noise from "Voice of America" and the like never stopped. The six-person delegation began to show cracks. The team leader often expressed dissatisfaction with the Party. He Duanshi proposed to hold an emergency Party branch meeting to unify thoughts.

After the team leader betrayed the country, everyone elected He Duanshi as the Party branch leader. He firmly denounced the traitor with a resolute stance, educating everyone that even in a foreign country, they must maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee. His performance was commended and rewarded by the national foreign affairs department and Zibo City Pharmaceutical Company and other units.

**Tradition Has Not Been Lost**

New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory is an old military enterprise born in the anti-Japanese war. Under the impact of the commodity economy, New Hua people were once a bit confused. Some people began to look for ways to make big money, some employees took long vacations, ran transportation, and some set up stalls at home, selling roasted chickens.

Facing the abnormal phenomenon of "big goals getting smaller and smaller, and small goals getting bigger and bigger" among some employees, the factory leadership promptly proposed that "New Hua's traditions must not be lost."

This factory, which developed during the revolutionary war and has long been educated by the Party, has always attached importance to the role of political propagandists and the construction of the political work team, using them to educate employees to carry forward good traditions. In the past year, the state adjusted credit, tightened money supply, and the factory faced great difficulties in funds and raw materials. The general manager promptly communicated with the team leaders, presenting the economic situation and the specific difficulties of the factory to everyone. The team leaders immediately expressed, "No matter how big the difficulties are, everyone will bear them, there is no mountain of fire that cannot be crossed." Thus, the entire factory launched a campaign of "one person saving one fen, one degree of electricity, one drop of water, one gram of material" from the bottom up. Not only did it ease the contradiction of tight funds and materials, but it also ensured the completion of the production plan for the entire factory. Over the past decade, New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory has built more than 30 dormitory buildings. Among the total of 320 three-room households, only 4 are occupied by factory-level leaders. General Manager He Duanshi, who has a family of four, and Party Secretary Lu Shengmin, who has three generations living together, each have two rooms. There have been a few times when the staff and workers' congress wanted to adjust the housing for the general manager and the secretary, but they insisted on not doing so. Since the reform and opening up, more than 100 factory-level and above cadres in this factory have not been punished for any illegal, disorderly, or bribery issues.

**Warmth Like a Mother**

The leadership of New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory often says, "No matter which unit or person, as long as he steps into the three acres of New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory, we must make him feel the warmth here."

The reporter felt this deeply during the days of the interview.

Wang Xueling (worker in the seventh workshop): New Hua is a warm collective, making everyone feel comfortable and at ease. Once, on a rainy day, I was sick at home. The workshop director, Fu Hengchen, learned about it and rode a bicycle in the rain to visit me. That scene is unforgettable. Of course, "when employees are sick, leaders are worried," is not a new thing in our factory.

Meng Jihan (Party branch secretary of the factory research institute): Last year, Huangfu Chuangqing, a student from Shandong Medical School, came to our analysis group for internship. During this period, he caught the flu and was bedridden at school, asking someone to inform the research institute that he could not come to work. The school is more than 8 miles away from New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory. After learning about this situation, Yang Jinhuai from the analysis group and Zhang Lianying, the trade union chairman, brought fruits, canned food, and other items to visit him. Huangfu Chuangqing never expected that as a native of Jinan and an intern, he would not be able to work in Zibo in the future, and his illness could move so many warm-hearted people in New Hua Factory? He was moved, and at the time of graduation, he strongly requested to work at New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory. Through the efforts of all parties, he finally got his wish.

Hua Qiuying (director of the factory science association): Over the years, I have deeply felt the spiritual power of New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory, which emphasizes principles and cherishes feelings. Here, intellectuals have a place to belong, and they enjoy preferential policies in terms of professional titles, converting agricultural workers to non-agricultural workers, and housing. The 63-year-old old expert Yang Wenhang, whose child's marriage urged him to return home, was devoted to his work and could not take care of it. He said, "Working in New Hua Factory is down-to-earth."

I remember someone once said, "Like kneading dough, when the dough is kneaded, you can't tell which is water and which is dough. The relationship between economic work and ideological and political work must also reach such a state." The reporter learned that effective ideological and political work has significantly enhanced the cohesion of New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory. Last summer, the new East Factory of New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory was short of funds. At that time, the wind of hoarding was blowing fiercely in society, but the employees of the new East Factory resisted the interference of the hoarding wind, voluntarily raised funds, and even retired old workers rushed back to the factory to pay the "factory love money." In a short period, the new East Factory received a total of more than 1.4 million yuan in voluntary funds from the employees of the factory.

    活力的源泉
    ——山东新华制药厂思想政治工作散记
    本报记者　郭嘉
    山东新华制药厂已走过了46年历程。这个被誉为“远东地区最大的解热药生产厂区”，全国医药行业中首家通过一级企业评审的厂家，在改革、开放的新形势下，焕发出勃勃生机和活力。全厂5000余名职工，以“政治坚定，艰苦奋斗；干群团结，爱厂如家”的新华精神，推动了企业步步迈向全新的台阶：18种出口产品全部免检，20种产品获省优、国优。去年以来，该厂先后被评为全国“五一”劳动先进集体、全国医药系统思想政治工作先进单位和全国思想政治工作优秀企业。
    烈火见真金
    今年4至6月，首都经历了一个从学潮到动乱到反革命暴乱的非常时期，并影响到全国各地。
    5月中旬，淄博农机学院和淄博师范学院等院校的数百名学生三次游行到新华药厂门口，要求声援。他们喊着：“新华人，上街去，不上街，没路去”的口号，在新华药厂门外的墙壁、电杆和路面上四处张贴、抛洒传单。
    面对复杂的局面，新华药厂的领导处险不惊。党委、厂部以人民日报“4·26”社论及时统一职工的思想，号召党员、干部同党中央保持一致，以实际行动支持党中央。
    当游行队伍频繁出现在厂门口时，全厂职工不为所动；在团委带动下，400多名青年自愿组织成义务护厂队，游行队伍散去时，职工们又及时出动，清除传单。这期间，33名职工向党组织递交了入党申请书，表达了他们坚信党的领导，与党中央保持一致的决心。
    在黑云压城的5月底，厂长贺端湜正在意大利，出席“世界大众药协会会议”。贺端湜听不到北京的声音，而“美国之音”之类的反华鼓噪声却不绝于耳。6个人组成的代表团出现裂纹了。团长时常流露出对党的不满情绪。贺端湜提议召开临时党小组会议，统一思想。
    团长叛国后，大家推选贺端湜当党小组长。他以坚定的立场痛斥叛国分子，教育大家身在异国更要和党中央保持一致。他的表现受到国家外事部门和淄博市医药公司等单位的通报表彰和奖励。
    传统没有丢
    新华药厂是诞生于抗日烽火中的一个老军工企业。在商品经济的冲击下，新华人一度显得有点慌乱。有的人开始寻找挣大钱的门路，有些职工休长假、跑运输，还有的在家支起了货亭，卖起了烧鸡。
    面对部分职工“大目标越来越小，小目标越来越大”的不正常现象，厂领导果断地提出“新华传统不能丢”。
    这个在革命战争中发展起来的、长期受党的教育的新华药厂，历来注重政治宣传员的作用和政工队伍的建设，通过他们教育职工弘扬优良传统。去年以来，国家调整信贷，紧缩银根，厂里资金和原材料都发生了很大困难。厂长及时与班组长对话，把经济形势和厂里的具体困难，摆给大家。班组长当即表示：“天大的困难大家担，没有过不去的火焰山。”于是，全厂自下而上发起了一人节约一分钱、一度电、一滴水、一克料的增产节约活动。不仅缓和了资金和原料紧缺的矛盾，同时保证了全厂生产计划的实现。十年来，新华制药厂先后盖了30多栋宿舍楼，在总共320套三室的房户中，厂级领导干部仅有4户。4口之家的厂长贺端湜和三代同堂的厂党委书记鲁省民才各有两间住房。曾有几次，职代会要给厂长、书记调房子，他俩执意不从。改革、开放以来，该厂100多名厂处级以上干部，没有一人因违法乱纪、贪污受贿等问题受到处分。
    温暖亲似娘
    新华药厂的领导经常说：“不管哪个单位，不管什么人，只要他踏上新华药厂三分地，我们就要使他感到这里的温暖。”
    记者在所采访的几天里，深有所感。
    王学龄（七车间工人）：新华是一个温暖的集体，处处让人感到舒心坦然。有一次下雨天，我生病在家，车间主任付恒谦获悉后，冒雨骑着单车来家看我，那时那景，我永生难忘。当然，“职工生病，领导揪心”，在我们厂不算什么新鲜事。
    孟继寒（厂研究所党支部书记）：去年，山东医药学校学生皇甫传青来我所分析组实习。期间，他患流感卧校，托人给研究所捎信不能上班。该校离新华药厂8里多路。分析组杨锦怀知道这一情况后和工会组长张连英等人一道，提着水果、罐头等去看他。皇甫传青怎么也没想到，自己是济南人，又是个实习生，以后也不可能留在淄博工作，自己的病，能够牵动新华厂这么多热心人？他感动了，毕业之际，他强烈要求来新华药厂工作。通过多方努力，他总算如愿以偿。
    华秋萍（厂科协主任）：这些年来，我深深体味到新华药厂既讲原则，更重情感的精神力量。在这里，知识分子心有所归，他们在职称、农转非和分房等政策上享受优惠。63岁的老专家杨文衡，孩子结婚催他回去，他却一心扑在事业上，未能顾上。他说：“在新华厂干事踏实。”
    记得有位人士这样说过：“就像和面那样，面和好了，你分不清哪是水，哪是面。经济工作同思想政治工作的关系，也必须达到这样一种境界。”记者了解到，行之有效的思想政治工作，使新华药厂的凝聚力明显增强。去年夏天，新华药厂新建东厂资金匮乏。当时，社会上抢购风刮得正烈，但新建东厂的职工抵制了抢购风的袭扰，自愿集资，连退休的老工人也赶回工厂交“爱厂金”。在短短的时间内，新建东厂共收到本厂职工自动集资款140多万元。
