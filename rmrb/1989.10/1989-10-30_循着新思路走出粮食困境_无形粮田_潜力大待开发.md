Breaking Through the Food Crisis with New Ideas
The Potential of "Invisible Farmland" Awaits Development

Correcting the "Focus on the Front, Neglect the Back" Tendency, One Year Can Recover Over 100 Billion Kilograms of Grain from Post-Harvest Processing and Utilization

In recent years, the supply and demand imbalance of grain has been a widely discussed "hot topic." However, did you know that in addition to the 1.5 mu of arable land per capita in China, there is another "wasteland" equivalent to one-quarter of the total arable land area that many people have not yet recognized? Some grain experts and visionaries believe that by paying attention to and developing this area, we can increase grain production by over 100 million tons per year, which will open up a new path for China to overcome the grain crisis.

The reporter received this task from the editorial department and, over the course of more than three months of investigation, witnessed this vast potential "invisible farmland." It is hidden in the fields and yards where farmers harvest and thresh, on the trucks and ships transporting grain, in grain storage and processing, on the dining tables of urban and rural residents, and so on. According to experts' calculations, the total grain loss in the various stages of post-harvest processing and utilization in China is as high as 129 billion kilograms per year. Based on the highest grain yield in 1984, this is equivalent to a "reduction" of 31% in a bumper harvest year, far exceeding the losses caused by any natural disasters since the founding of the People's Republic of China!

Experts have also calculated that if we can turn this "loss and recovery" into "recovery and loss," a huge potential will be presented to us: Currently, the loss rate of grain in China from harvest, storage, transportation to initial processing is as high as 15%. If this is reduced to the 5% standard set by the World Food and Agriculture Organization, 40 billion kilograms of grain can be saved annually. By gradually replacing direct grain feeding with compound feed for livestock and poultry, 30 billion kilograms of grain can be saved annually. If the surplus grain alcohol production is reduced by half (still more than double the amount in 1978), 7 billion kilograms of grain can be saved annually. If the waste of rice, noodles, chicken, fish, and eggs by urban and rural residents every day is reduced, it is equivalent to saving 200 billion kilograms of grain annually. Promoting grain precision sowing technology on a large scale can also save 50 billion kilograms of seeds. All these aspects can "increase" grain production by over 100 billion kilograms.

This figure is both surprising and encouraging, as it means: Based on the current grain yield per unit area in China, it is equivalent to expanding 400 million mu of "invisible farmland" on top of the existing arable land; equivalent to the total grain production of Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi, the four major grain-producing provinces in 1988; exceeding the national annual grain contract procurement quota, which can guarantee the grain supply for over 200 million urban residents for nearly three years, and can save the state over 30 billion yuan in fiscal subsidies annually. In China, every increase of 100 million tons of grain production is a new level. From 1957 to 1978, it took 22 years to increase from 200 million tons to 300 million tons, and from 1979 to 1984, it took 6 years to increase from 300 million tons to 400 million tons. However, developing the post-harvest "invisible farmland" well is equivalent to reaching a new level in one year.

For a long time, many places have been overjoyed when grain harvests are good and dejected when there is a reduction. However, few people pay attention to the post-harvest status of grain. This has resulted in outdated tools and facilities in the various stages of grain processing, poor management, and increased grain loss.

The reporter asked some county and rural party and government officials: "Why don't you manage the severe grain loss in rural storage?" The response was: "Our task is to focus on agricultural production. Once the grain is produced, it becomes the responsibility of the grain department!" The reporter then went to ask the grain department, but some grain bureau directors complained: "Sigh, we are already struggling to manage our own affairs. How can we have the energy to manage the thousands of households in rural areas? You go and see the state-level grain depots, they are dilapidated, and there are still many open-air warehouses. The losses from rodent damage, insect damage, dampness, and mold are very large. We are always worried that something big might happen!..." The loss of grain during transportation and loading and unloading also far exceeds the national standard. In the annual average grain transportation of 150 billion kilograms in China, 60% is transported by open trucks, resulting in serious problems such as grain dampness, pollution, short weight, and theft.

People of insight in various places call for: Due to the neglect in macro-decision making, the "focus on the front, neglect the back" tendency in China's grain production must be corrected during the economic rectification. They suggest that relevant national departments should formulate strategic plans and preferential policies for the development of "invisible farmland," and at the same time, arouse the national awareness of the grain crisis, using the spirit of thrift and frugality to overcome the wind of waste and extravagance. If the existing farmland relies on 800 million farmers to cultivate, then the "invisible farmland" relies on the 1.1 billion people of the entire country to jointly develop.

### 循着新思路走出粮食困境　“无形粮田”潜力大待开发

　　循着新思路走出粮食困境
　　“无形粮田”潜力大待开发
　　纠正“顾前不顾后”倾向，一年可从产后处理利用各环
　　节夺回粮食一千多亿公斤，相当于四亿亩耕地的产量
    近年来粮食供需矛盾是人们普遍关注的“热点”。但是，你知道吗？在我国人均一亩半耕地之外，还“荒芜”着一块许多人至今没有认识到的相当于总耕地面积1／4的“无形粮田”！一些粮食专家和有识之士认为，重视并把它开发出来，一年就可以“增产”粮食一亿多吨，这将为我国走出粮食困境打开一条新路。
    记者接到编辑部这一任务，在3个多月时间的调查中，耳闻目睹了这块潜力巨大的“无形粮田”。它隐没在农民收割拉打的田间、场地上，南来北往运粮的车船上，粮食储藏和加工上，城乡人们的餐桌上，……据专家测算，我国粮食产后处理利用的诸环节中，总损耗的粮食一年高达1290亿公斤。以1984年的最高粮食总产计算，等于丰收之年“减产”31％，大大超过建国以来粮食产前任何一次自然灾害造成的损失！
    专家们又测算，如果把这种“得而复失”变为“失而复得”，展现在我们面前的则是一笔巨大的潜力帐：目前全国粮食从收获、储藏、运输到初加工过程的损耗率高达15％，若降低到世界粮农组织规定5％的标准，每年可减少粮食损失400亿公斤；用配合饲料逐步取代直接用粮食喂饲畜禽，每年可节粮300亿公斤；将过剩的粮食酒产量减少一半（仍比1978年多一倍以上），每年可少耗粮70亿公斤；如果将全国城乡居民每天吃剩倒掉的米饭、面食鸡肉鱼蛋等省下来，一年约折合原粮200多亿公斤；大面积推广粮食精播技术，也可少用种子50亿公斤。以上诸方面共可“增产”粮食1000多亿公斤。
    这个数字是令人既吃惊又鼓舞的，因为它意味着：按目前我国粮食单产水平，等于在现有耕地之外又扩大4亿亩“无形粮田”；相当于皖、鲁、苏、赣4个主要产粮省1988年的粮食总产之和；超过了国家一年的粮食合同定购量，可以保证供应全国2亿多城市居民近3年的口粮，每年能为国家节省财政补贴300多亿元。在我国，粮食每增产1亿吨为上一个台阶，从1957年到1978年由2亿吨提高到3亿吨用了22年，从1979年到1984年由3亿吨提高到4亿吨用了6年，而开发好粮食产后这块“无形粮田”，等于一年就跃上一个新台阶。
    长期以来，许多地方粮食丰收了兴高彩烈，减产了垂头丧气。至于粮食产后状况如何却很少有人问津。致使粮食处理诸环节工具落后、设施陈旧，疏于管理，加剧了粮食的损耗。
    记者问过一些地县和农村党政干部：“农村储粮损耗那么严重，你们为啥不管？”回答是：“我们的任务是抓农业生产，粮食生产出来以后就是粮食部门的责任了！”记者又去问粮食部门，谁知一些粮食局长却叫苦不迭：“唉，我们自顾不暇，哪还有功夫去管农村千家万户？你去看看国家基层粮库，破破烂烂，还有不少露天仓，鼠害、虫害、受潮、霉变的损失很大，我们成天提心吊胆，生怕闹出大事情！……”粮食运输、装卸上的损耗也远远超过国家规定标准。我国年平均粮食调运量1500亿公斤中，靠敞篷车调运的占60％左右，由此造成的粮食受潮、污染、短包和被盗现象严重。
    各地有识之士呼吁：由于宏观决策上的忽视，对我国粮食生产这种“顾前不顾后”的倾向，在治理整顿经济环境中一定要加以纠正。他们建议国家有关部门要制订开发“无形粮田”的战略规划和优惠政策，同时唤起全民对粮食问题的危机感，以勤俭节约之风去压倒浪费、奢靡之风。如果说现有粮田靠8亿农民去耕耘，那么“无形粮田”则要靠全国11亿人民去共同开发。
