The Central Advisory Commission of the Communist Party of China held a meeting in Beijing from October 11 to 13 for its members in the capital to study Jiang Zemin's speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The meeting emphasized that Marxism is our guiding banner. We must persist in combining Marxist basic principles with China's specific realities, achieving unity between theory and practice, subjectivity and objectivity, and establishing and perfecting our policies in this process. We must create and develop our own experiences and steadfastly follow our own path to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Standing Committee members of the Central Advisory Commission, Wang Ping, Wang Shoudao, Liu Lantao, Jiang Hua, Xiao Ke, Yu Qiuyi, Song Shiwu, Zhang Jingfu, Chen Pixin, Chen Xilian, Duan Junyi, Geng Biao, and Kang Shien, participated in the study and discussion.

The members believed that Jiang Zemin's National Day speech reflected the collective wisdom and was a powerful weapon for unifying the Party's thinking. It was the policy guideline for the third generation of the Party's leadership to continue advancing socialist modernization and reform.

Many members noted that the speech, using Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, analyzed China's journey and achievements over the past 40 years, treating the 40 years as a whole while emphasizing the past 10 years, especially the new experiences since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. It drew four fundamental conclusions and addressed ten important issues of widespread concern within and outside the Party. In summary, it scientifically expounded on how to adhere to the socialist path and develop socialist undertakings under the Party's leadership, clarifying the basic principles and characteristics of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This further pointed the direction for China's future economic and social development, and its significance and impact should not be underestimated. The speech particularly emphasized the need to unite the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up in theory and practice, clearly pointing out the two distinct stances on reform and opening up, and the need to draw a clear line between them. This is crucial and relates to the political direction and success or failure of reform and opening up. Why do a few people always separate reform and opening up from the Four Cardinal Principles, opposing them? It is because they view reform and opening up with bourgeois liberalization, attempting to change the socialist nature of our reform and opening up and implement capitalism. This is the essence of the problem. Yet, these people claim to be "radical reformers," but in reality, they are a group of "retrogressive conservatives" advocating for a historical reversal.

The members proposed that the study of Jiang Zemin's speech should not stop at verbal expressions but must be linked to the actual work of rectification and deepening reform, and to the work of various regions and departments. They must seriously summarize experiences, unify thinking, and resolutely implement the spirit of the speech. They must prevent empty talk and formalism.

The members believed that the task of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is arduous, with countless details to attend to. Based on historical and contemporary experiences both domestically and internationally, strengthening Party building is of paramount importance. Domestic and foreign hostile forces use infiltration, subversion, and "peaceful evolution" to attempt to overthrow our socialist system and disintegrate our Party, making us lose our combat effectiveness. Under such circumstances, we must prioritize Party building and do it well; otherwise, the consequences will be dire. The occurrence and development of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion have shown that the main problem lies within the Party. Over the years, due to the mistakes of the Party's main leaders on fundamental issues, not adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, supporting bourgeois liberalization, downplaying Party building, neglecting ideological and political work, some Party members did not play a vanguard role, and some grassroots organizations were weak and scattered. This should be of great concern to the entire Party. The members proposed to invest significant effort in rectifying the Party's organizations. Various levels of Party committees should seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of Party building, especially during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, and establish a cadre team of the Party that is armed with Marxist thought and can withstand hardships. Everyone believes that as long as we do a good job in Party building, we can withstand any storm and always remain invincible.

The members emphasized the need to strengthen the inspection, supervision, and guidance of the investigation and rectification work. Those with serious issues during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion must be thoroughly investigated, leaving no hidden dangers. For the majority of the people who made general mistakes, they should be educated, distinguished between right and wrong, and summarized experiences, and then promptly released, so they can put down their burdens and move forward lightly. This matter directly relates to the stability of the overall situation and social harmony and unity, and it should not be taken lightly.

The members, based on their own experiences, talked about how Communist Party members, especially leading cadres, must consciously align their words and actions with the Party's line, principles, and resolutions. This is an important guarantee for consolidating the Party's unity and enhancing its combat effectiveness. Deviating from the Party's resolutions and acting independently is a violation of Party discipline.

The members emphasized that strengthening Party building requires strict demands on Party members and cadres, education, and supervision. Various illegal and disciplinary actions and corrupt practices within the Party must be resolutely corrected. They believed that strictly implementing democratic centralism and carrying out active criticism and self-criticism are important contents of a healthy Party life. Criticism and self-criticism must adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, encouraging everyone to speak the truth, not falsehoods. Leaders should welcome everyone speaking the truth, especially unpalatable truths. Speaking falsehoods and deceiving will mislead the country and the people, ultimately harming oneself.

The members unanimously supported treating the study and research of Marxist theory as a major task for the entire Party. Especially among high-level cadres within the Party, it is advocated to seriously study and research Marxist-Leninist basic theories, especially Marxist philosophy. Mastering this great tool of cognition can correctly and effectively explore contemporary major political, economic, and social theoretical issues. They must resolutely correct the situation where leaders are bogged down in daily affairs, neglect theoretical study, and do not pay attention to ideological and political dynamics, and genuinely improve their theoretical level and political acumen. Over 100 members and old comrades of the Central Advisory Commission in Beijing participated in the three-day study.

    中顾委在京委员学习江泽民讲话
    创造发展我们的经验  坚定不移走自己的路
    委员们强调要联系实际贯彻讲话精神防止说空话
    新华社北京10月14日电　中共中央顾问委员会10月11日至13日召开在京委员会议，认真学习江泽民同志在庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年大会上的讲话。
    会议指出，马克思主义是我们前进的旗帜。我们只有坚持把马克思主义基本原理和我国的具体实际结合起来，在结合中实现理论与实践、主观与客观的统一，在结合中确立和完善我们的政策，创造和发展我们的经验，坚定不移地走自己的路，才能建设好有中国特色的社会主义。
    中顾委常委王平、王首道、刘澜涛、江华、肖克、余秋里、宋时轮、张劲夫、陈丕显、陈锡联、段君毅、耿飚、康世恩等参加了学习讨论。
    委员们认为，江泽民同志的国庆讲话集中了集体的智慧，是统一全党认识的强大武器，是党的第三代领导人继续推进社会主义现代化建设和社会主义改革事业的施政纲领。
    许多委员谈到，这个讲话运用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法，分析了我国40年来所走过的历程和取得的经验，把40年作为一个整体，又突出了近10年，特别强调党的十一届三中全会以来的新经验，得出了四个基本结论，着重回答了党内外普遍关注的十个重要问题。总结起来，就是科学地阐明了如何在党的领导下坚持社会主义道路和发展社会主义事业的问题，阐明了建设有中国特色的社会主义的基本原则和基本特征。从而为我国今后的经济和社会的发展进一步指明了方向，其意义和影响不可低估。《讲话》中特别强调了要从理论上和实践上把坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放统一起来，明确指出了在改革开放的问题上存在两种截然不同的主张，必须划清两者的根本界限，这一点极为重要，关系到改革开放的政治方向和成败问题。极少数人为什么总是把改革开放同四项基本原则割裂开来、对立起来呢？就是因为他们是用资产阶级自由化的思想来看待改革开放，企图改变我们改革开放的社会主义性质，实行资本主义化。这就是问题的实质所在。而这些人却说自己是改革的“激进派”，其实他们是一伙宣传历史开倒车的“激退派”。
    委员们提出，学习江泽民同志的讲话，不能停留在口头的表态上，一定要联系治理整顿和深化改革的实际，联系各地区、各部门的工作实际，认真总结经验，统一思想，坚决贯彻落实。切实防止说空话，流于形式。
    委员们认为，建设有中国特色的社会主义任务很重，工作千头万绪，根据国内、国际的历史和现实的经验教训，抓好党的建设是头等重要的事情。国内国外的敌对势力千方百计地通过渗透、颠覆、“和平演变”等手段，企图颠覆我们的社会主义制度，企图瓦解我们的党，使我们失去战斗力。在这种形势下，我们必须把党的建设放在首位来抓，并且一定要抓好，否则后果不堪设想。这次动乱和反革命暴乱的发生、发展，问题主要出在党内，就是一个深刻的教训。这些年来，由于党的主要领导人在根本问题上犯了错误，不坚持四项基本原则，支持资产阶级自由化，淡化党的建设，忽视思想政治工作，一些党员不发挥先锋模范作用，一些基层组织软弱涣散，应该引起全党的高度重视。委员们提出，要花大力气整顿党的组织，各级党委要认真总结党的建设的经验教训，特别是在这次动乱、反革命暴乱中的经验教训，建立起一支用马克思主义思想武装的过得硬的党的骨干队伍。大家相信，只要把党的建设搞好了，我们就能经得起任何风浪的考验，就能始终立于不败之地。
    委员们强调，要加强对清查清理工作的检查、督促和指导，对那些在动乱和反革命暴乱中有严重问题的人和事，一定要彻底查清，不留隐患；而对犯有一般性错误的大多数群众，应在普遍教育、明辨是非、总结经验的基础上，及时解脱，使他们放下包袱，轻装前进。这件事，直接关系到大局的稳定和社会的安定团结，切不可掉以轻心。
    委员们结合自己的经验谈到，共产党员、党的干部特别是领导干部，在言论和行动上必须自觉地同党的路线、方针、决议保持一致。这是巩固党的团结统一和增强党的战斗力的重要保证。离开党的决议，自行其是，是党纪不容的。
    委员们强调，加强党的建设，关键是要对党员和党员干部严格要求，加强教育，加强监督。对党内存在的违法乱纪的行为和各种腐败现象，必须坚决纠正。他们认为，严格实行民主集中制，开展积极的批评与自我批评，是健全党内民主生活的重要内容。开展批评与自我批评，必须坚持实事求是的原则，要提倡大家讲真话，不讲假话。领导干部要欢迎大家讲真话，特别是不顺耳的真话。讲假话，弄虚作假，就会误国误民，最终害了自己。
    委员们一致拥护把学习、研究马克思主义的理论当作全党的一件大事来抓。特别是在党内高级干部中，要提倡认真学习和研究马克思列宁主义基本理论，特别是学习和研究马克思主义哲学。掌握这个伟大的认识工具，才能正确有效地探讨当代重大的政治、经济、社会理论问题。要坚决纠正领导干部陷入日常事务，放松理论学习，不注意思想动态、政治动态的状况，切切实实提高理论水平和政治敏锐性。中顾委在京委员和老同志100多人参加了为期3天的学习。
