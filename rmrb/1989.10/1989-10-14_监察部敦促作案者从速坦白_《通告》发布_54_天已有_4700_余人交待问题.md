The Supervision Department Urges Perpetrators to Confess Quickly

4,700+ People Have Confessed Issues in 54 Days Since the Issuance of the Notice

Beijing, October 13th - According to information obtained by reporter Shū Yú from the National Supervision Department, from the issuance of the notice on August 19th to October 11th, a total of 54 days, 4,759 people from 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as various ministries under the State Council, have confessed to issues related to embezzlement, bribery, and other illegal and disciplinary violations to various levels of supervision departments. Among them, there are 6 department-level cadres and 270 section-level cadres.

In the fight against embezzlement and bribery, various levels of supervision departments across the country have resolutely implemented the policy of "confess and be lenient, resist and be strict." According to incomplete statistics, more than 500 people who have voluntarily confessed and reported their issues have received lenient treatment. For example, a section chief in a city construction bureau in Fujian Province received 22,612 yuan in bribes. He voluntarily surrendered, actively returned the illicit money and items, and actively exposed the issues of others. The procuratorate decided not to prosecute him, and the supervision bureau gave him a demotion. At the same time, some people with bad attitudes who refused to confess and attempted to cover up their crimes have been severely punished. For instance, a clerk in a county in Fujian Province used his position to accept more than 6,000 yuan in bribes. Because he refused to confess and transferred the illicit money, the supervision bureau handed him over to the judicial authorities. Currently, this person has been legally arrested.

At a meeting held today, a responsible person from the Supervision Department reiterated: Currently, there is more than half a month left until the deadline specified in the notice. Those who have issues but are still hesitating should seize the opportunity and make a wise choice. Hesitation and attempting to cover up crimes is a dead end. Anyone who confesses and reports their issues within the deadline specified in the notice will receive lenient treatment.

    监察部敦促作案者从速坦白
    《通告》发布54天已有4700余人交待问题
    本报北京10月13日讯　记者舒瑜从国家监察部获悉：监察部8月19日发布《通告》至10月11日的54天中，全国30个省、市、自治区以及国务院各部委，已有4759人向各级监察机关坦白交待了贪污、贿赂等违法违纪问题，其中有厅局级干部6人，处级干部270人。
    全国各级监察机关在反贪污、反受贿斗争中，坚决执行“坦白从宽、抗拒从严”的政策。据不完全统计，全国已有500多主动坦白交待问题的人得到了从宽处理。例如，福建省某市城建局一股长受贿22612元，他主动投案，积极退还赃款、赃物，并积极检举其他人的问题，检察院对其免予起诉，监察局给予其撤职处分。同时，也有一些态度恶劣、拒不交待、企图蒙混过关的人受到了从严惩处，如福建省某县一业务员利用职务之便，收受贿赂6000余元。由于他拒不交待问题，并转移赃款，监察局将其移送司法机关，目前此人已被依法逮捕。
    在今日举行的一次座谈会上，监察部负责人重申：目前，距离《通告》规定的限期还有半个多月，那些确有问题而至今仍徘徊观望的人要审时度势，尽快做出明智选择。徘徊观望企图蒙混过关是自寻绝路。凡是在《通告》规定限期内坦白交待自己问题的，都将受到宽大处理。
