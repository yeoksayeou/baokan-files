It is well known that the Mississippi River basin is not only densely populated with industrial bases but also rich in resources, earning it the title of "America's Granary." However, recently, an environmental protection committee in the United States, after conducting a two-year field investigation of the Mississippi River, declared that due to the "misuse" of this great river and the "neglect" of environmental protection work in its basin, the river will inevitably face ecological imbalances in the "not-too-distant future." Experts predict that if the development of the shipping industry continues unabated while neglecting the construction of new water conservancy facilities (such as building dams), then within 50 years, the Mississippi River will experience severe flooding in some of its basins, turning vast tracts of fertile land into marshes.

    谷仓将沦为沼泽
    众所周知，密西西比河流域不仅工业基地密布，而且物产丰饶，有美国的“谷仓”之称。但最近美国的一个环保委员会在对密西西比河进行长达两年的实地考察后宣称：由于对这条大河的“滥用”以及对其流域环保工作的“忽视”，这条大河在“不远的将来”肯定将出现生态失衡。专家们预测，如果仍一味发展航运业但同时疏于修建新的水利工程设施（如造拦河坝）的话，那么密西西比河在50年内将在部分流域泛滥成灾，并使大片良田沦为沼泽。　（水草）
