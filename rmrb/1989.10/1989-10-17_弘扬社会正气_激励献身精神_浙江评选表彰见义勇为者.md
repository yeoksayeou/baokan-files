In the midst of a crackdown on various illegal and criminal activities, Zhejiang Province is witnessing a new atmosphere of "promoting social justice and encouraging selfless spirit." On October 13th, 33 individuals, selected from nominations across the province, were invited to Hangzhou to receive a grand commendation, sparking a warm response from various sectors of society.

In recent times, the dilution of socialist moral education has allowed negative tendencies such as "prioritizing self-interest over justice" and "ignoring others' plight" to flourish. The selection activity, jointly initiated by the provincial Public Security Bureau, the Commerce Bureau, and the Zhejiang Daily, stands in stark contrast to the numerous, costly, and labor-intensive "elections" prevalent today. During the selection process, some cities organized candidates to give speeches locally, while others established "Seeing Justice Done Foundations" to periodically evaluate and commend individuals.

According to the selection office, within less than a month, hundreds of candidates were recommended from across the province. Among them were rural party cadres who bravely fought against hijackers, individual entrepreneurs who fearlessly extinguished blazes, young women who courageously defended state property, elementary school students who selflessly rescued drowning children, and numerous "unsung heroes" who fought against various illegal activities to maintain social order.

The reporter noted that since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, signs of positive changes in social attitudes have begun to emerge. At the same time as the announcement of the Zhejiang Province heroes who saw justice done, local judicial authorities disclosed two significant figures to the media: in August and September, the provincial procuratorates received 8,499 tips from the public about various illegal activities, the highest number of tips received since the establishment of the tip-off center over a year ago; in the past two months, over 450 economic criminals have surrendered themselves, many of whom have repented under the persuasion of friends and family.

### 弘扬社会正气  激励献身精神  浙江评选表彰见义勇为者

    弘扬社会正气  激励献身精神
    浙江评选表彰见义勇为者
    本报杭州电　记者高海浩报道：在严厉打击各种违法犯罪活动的同时，浙江省正在呈现“弘扬社会正气、激励献身精神”的新气象。10月13日，由全省各地群众推荐评选的33名见义勇为先进人物应邀来到杭州，接受隆重表彰，在社会各界引起热烈反响。
    过去一段时间里，由于淡化社会主义道德风尚教育，“见利忘义”、“见死不救”等不良风气滋长。由省公安厅、商业厅和浙江日报社联合发起的这一评选活动，与时下名目繁多、劳民伤财的“评选”形成鲜明的对比。在评选过程中，有的地市组织候选人在当地进行演讲，也有的地方设立“见义勇为基金会”，今后定期评选表彰。
    据评选办公室介绍，在不到一个月的时间里，全省各地推荐的见义勇为人物候选人达数百名之多。他们当中有临危不惧与劫机罪犯搏斗的农村党的干部，挺身而出扑救烈火的个体户，为保护国家财产勇斗歹徒的女青年，抢救落水儿童英勇献身的小学生，还有在维护社会治安中与各种违法行为斗争的许多“无名英雄”。
    记者注意到，首都平息反革命暴乱后，此间的社会风气开始出现种种积极变化的迹象。就在浙江省见义勇为先进人物评选揭晓的同时，当地司法部门向新闻界披露了两个颇有意义的数字：在8、9月间，全省检察机关收到群众举报各种违法行为的线索8499件，是举报中心成立1年多来受理举报最多的时期；在最近的两个月，全省已有450余名经济违法犯罪者投案自首，他们当中许多人是在亲友规劝下幡然悔悟的。
