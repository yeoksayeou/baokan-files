Beijing Broadcasting Institute and the Institute's Discipline Inspection Commission have respectively decided on September 18 and 26 to expel Su Xiaokang from public office and party membership.

Su Xiaokang is a teacher at the Journalism Department of Beijing Broadcasting Institute. Since joining in 1987, he has persistently adhered to a bourgeois liberalization stance despite repeated criticism, education, and warnings from the organization. He has continuously published articles and reportage attacking the Party and socialism, and participated in the scripting of the television program "River Elegy." He has long refused to undertake teaching duties and has not participated in party organizational activities. Su Xiaokang actively participated in organizing, planning, and inciting the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, he fled the country in fear of punishment and continued to engage in criminal activities against the motherland.

Given that Su Xiaokang has degenerated into an enemy of the Party and the country, completely losing the qualifications of a state public official and party member, the Institute's Party Committee, in accordance with state regulations and after approval from higher authorities, decided at a meeting of the Institute's President's Office to expel Su Xiaokang from public office. The Beijing Broadcasting Institute Discipline Inspection Commission, in accordance with the Party Constitution and relevant regulations of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, unanimously passed a resolution to expel Su Xiaokang from the Party.

    北京广播学院和院纪委决定
    开除苏晓康公职和党籍
    本报北京10月6日讯　北京广播学院和中共北京广播学院纪委分别于9月18日、26日作出决定，开除苏晓康的公职和党籍。
    苏晓康是北京广播学院新闻系教师。自1987年调入以来，他不顾组织上多次批评教育和劝告，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场，不断发表攻击党和社会主义的文章及报告文学作品，参与电视片《河殇》的总撰稿；长期不承担教学任务，不参加党的组织生活。苏晓康积极参与组织策划和煽动学潮、动乱及反革命暴乱活动。平息反革命暴乱之后，他畏罪叛逃国外，继续参与反对祖国的罪恶活动。
    鉴于苏晓康已堕落为与党与祖国为敌的罪人，完全丧失了国家公职人员和党员的应有条件。按照国家的有关规定，经上级领导机关批准，北京广播学院院长办公会议研究决定，开除苏晓康的公职；中共北京广播学院纪律检查委员会根据党章和中纪委的有关规定，一致通过了开除苏晓康党籍的决议。
