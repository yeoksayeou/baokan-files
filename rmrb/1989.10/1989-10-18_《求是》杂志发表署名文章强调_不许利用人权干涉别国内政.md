The 20th issue of *Seek Truth* magazine, published yesterday, features an article by Yi Ding titled "Opposing the Use of Human Rights to Interfere in Internal Affairs – Refuting the So-Called 'Human Rights Without Borders.'"

The article points out: In the spring and summer of 1989, a small number of people instigated a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist government of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese government, in accordance with the constitution, first imposed martial law in parts of Beijing and later took decisive measures to crush the counter-revolutionary riot. The aforementioned actions by the Chinese government are entirely justified and legal sovereign acts, which have been understood and supported by the vast majority of countries in the world. However, certain foreign forces have criticized a country's sovereign actions and arbitrarily interfered. This, of course, has aroused strong indignation and resistance from the Chinese people. They then argue that they are only expressing concern for human rights, and that human rights are borderless, so showing concern for the human rights of another country is not interference in internal affairs.

The article states: First of all, there does not exist an abstract concept of human rights that transcends borders and stages of social development and is universally applicable. According to the Marxist viewpoint, any right is historically produced and is a legal form of social economic relations; human rights, as part of rights, can only be certain rights established and recognized by law by the ruling class of a country.

Regarding the content of human rights, the traditional Western viewpoint emphasizes individual human rights, and within individual human rights, it mainly emphasizes civil and political rights. This viewpoint on human rights obviously does not take into account the different economic development levels and political situations of different countries. The vast majority of developing countries in the Third World, based on their own national conditions, emphasize collective human rights in their human rights views, believing that collective human rights are the foundation of all individual human rights and the prerequisite for individuals to enjoy all rights and freedoms; and they believe that economic, social, and cultural rights are inseparable from civil and political rights, equally important, and that full economic rights and economic guarantees are the material conditions for the realization of individual civil and political rights.

The article states: Secondly, there does not exist a universal human rights law that transcends borders and national legal regulations. In modern international society, each country, through its own domestic legislation, especially through the constitution or constitutional documents, regulates the basic rights and freedoms of citizens. Under the unified name of "human rights," the specific legal regulations of various countries regarding various human rights and freedoms are often different, sometimes even fundamentally different. If that is the case, then where is the legal basis for "human rights without borders"?

The article states: Thirdly, international human rights documents have not established a unified concept of human rights and legal regulations that transcend borders.

The article points out that the "human rights without borders" argument is not only theoretically wrong and legally untenable, but also politically and practically harmful. Those who advocate "human rights without borders" say that they are only concerned about human rights and have no intention of interfering in internal affairs. This statement is completely inconsistent with the facts. One country uses its embassy to provide sanctuary for criminals wanted by the host country, obstructing the host country's normal judicial proceedings, or provides a base for activities aimed at overthrowing the government of another country; or in its parliament, it makes a fuss about the internal affairs of another country, making groundless comments and criticisms; or it imposes economic sanctions because the internal affairs of another country do not meet its own values; or it even makes the lifting of martial law in another country a political condition for improving relations with that country, etc. These facts, are they merely "concern for the human rights of another country" and not a blatant interference in the internal affairs of another country?

The article states: On December 9, 1981, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 36/103, the *Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States*, which clearly stipulates that "no state or group of states has the right to intervene or interfere in any form or for any reason in the internal or external affairs of any other state." The *Declaration* also specifically addresses human rights issues, stating: "States have the obligation to avoid using and distorting human rights issues to exert pressure on other states or to create suspicion and confusion within other states or groups of states or among them."

The article concludes by stating that the current world situation is conducive to peace and development, but the international situation is also complex and tortuous. Any attempt to impose one's own values, political beliefs, and social systems on others will only cause friction and tension in international relations. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that China will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy and the policy of reform and opening up. We believe that on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, China's friendly and cooperative relations with various countries will be further strengthened and developed.

    《求是》杂志发表署名文章强调
    不许利用人权干涉别国内政
    新华社北京10月17日电　昨天出版的第20期《求是》杂志发表了一丁的文章《反对利用人权干涉别国内政——驳所谓“人权无国界”》。
    文章指出：1989年的春夏之交，极少数人在北京挑起了反革命暴乱，企图推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国政府。中国政府依据宪法的规定首先在北京部分地区实行了戒严，其后又采取断然措施，粉碎了反革命暴乱。中国政府的上述行为完全是天经地义、合理合法的主权行为，受到了世界上绝大多数国家的理解和支持。然而，某些外国势力却对一个国家的主权行为横加指责，恣意干涉。这就理所当然引起中国人民的强烈愤慨和反击。于是，它们辩解说，它们仅是对人权表示关注，而人权是无国界的，关注别国人权，不是干涉内政。
    文章说，首先，根本不存在超越国界、超越社会发展阶段而普遍适用的、抽象的人权。根据马克思主义的观点，任何权利都是历史地产生的，是社会经济关系的一种法律形式；人权作为权利的一个部分，只能是一国占统治地位的阶级用法律确认、设立的一定权利。
    在关于人权的内涵上，西方传统观点是强调个人人权，而在个人人权中又主要强调公民权利和政治权利。这种人权观点显然没有顾及不同国家的不同的经济发展水平和政治状况。广大第三世界发展中国家根据自己的国情特点，在人权观上更强调集体人权，认为集体人权是一切个人人权的基础，是个人享有一切权利和自由的先决条件；并认为经济、社会和文化权利与公民权利和政治权利不可分割，同等重要，充分的经济权利和经济保障是实现个人的公民权利和政治权利的物质条件。
    文章说，其次，根本不存在超越国界、超越各国法律规定的、普遍的人权法律。在现代国际社会中，各个国家都通过各自的国内立法，特别是通过宪法或宪法性文件，规定公民的基本权利和自由。在统一的“人权”名称下，各国关于各项人权权利和自由的具体法律规定，往往是有差异的，有时甚至是根本不同的。既然如此，那么，“人权无国界”的法律依据何在呢？
    文章说，第三，国际人权文书没有确立统一的人权概念和超越国界的法律规定。
    文章指出，“人权无国界”的论调不仅在理论上是错误的，在法律上是不能成立的，而且在政治上、实践上十分有害。鼓吹“人权无国界”的人说，他们仅仅是关注人权，无意干涉别国内政。这种说法也完全与事实不符。一国利用其使馆向被驻在国通缉的刑事罪犯提供庇护，妨碍驻在国的正常司法，或者向别国被通缉的刑事罪犯提供颠覆其本国政府的活动场所；或者在其国会对别国的内部事务吵吵嚷嚷，妄加评论和指责；或因别国的国内事务不符合自己的价值观念而采取经济制裁；甚至把别国是否取消戒严作为与其改善国家关系的政治条件，等等，这些事实，难道仅仅是“对别国人权的关心”而不是对别国内政的粗暴干涉吗？
    文章说，1981年12月9日，联合国大会第36／103号决议通过了《不容干涉和干预别国内政宣言》，其中明确规定，“任何国家或国家集团均无权以任何方式或以任何理由干涉或干预其他国家的内政和外交”。《宣言》还专门针对人权问题规定：“各国有义务避免利用和歪曲人权问题，以此作为对其他国家施加压力或在其他国家或国家集团内部或彼此之间制造猜疑和混乱的手段。”
    文章最后说，当今的世界局势有利于和平和发展，但国际形势又是曲折复杂的。任何企图将自己的价值观念、政治信仰、社会制度强加于人的作法，只会引起国际关系的摩擦和紧张。我国政府已一再表示，中国将一如既往地坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持改革开放的方针。我们相信，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，中国同各国之间的友好合作关系将会得到进一步加强和发展。
