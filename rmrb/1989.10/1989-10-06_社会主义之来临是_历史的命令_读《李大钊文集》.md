One hundred years ago, in 1889, a great figure in the history of the Chinese revolution was born. He was Li Dazhao, the pioneer of the Chinese Communist movement and a great Marxist. On the eve of the founding of the Communist Party of China, he wrote in an article: "The socialist society, whether people want it or not, its fate is bound to appear. This is the command of history. 'Since socialism stands on the inevitable course of human history and has the support of a great historical force, then the advent of socialism is as certain as the succession of night and day, and the fact that the Earth revolves around the Sun.' (Li Dazhao's Collected Works, Vol. 2, p. 334). This was a conclusion drawn by Li Dazhao after long-term revolutionary practice, studying Marxism, and continuous exploration at a critical moment in Chinese history.

Li Dazhao began as a patriot and revolutionary democrat. He supported the Xinhai Revolution and had high hopes for it. However, soon after, Yuan Shikai usurped power, and the revolution was aborted halfway. The political and economic situation in China remained the same. He wrote several articles exposing that China, which was supposedly a bourgeois republic, was actually a feudal dictatorship. What was the way out for China? At that time, Li Dazhao's worldview and methodology were still based on Darwin's theory of evolution, and Western bourgeois political and economic ideas had a significant influence on him. Therefore, Li Dazhao's plans to "transform China" and "build a youthful China" could only look to the West, hoping to establish a Western-style capitalist republic with a fully developed capitalist relationship and a bourgeoisie and large landowners as the central social forces, like the powerful countries in Europe and America and Japan at that time.

However, Li Dazhao was also skeptical about this bourgeois republic plan: "Whether it is good or bad, it is difficult to determine; whether it will last or not, it is also uncertain." (Vol. 1, p. 168). Li Dazhao continued to reflect and explore a new path that could truly save the Chinese nation.

In 1917, the October Revolution in Russia marked the beginning of a new era in human history and brought Marxism to the Chinese people. Before this, Li Dazhao, while studying in Japan, had come into contact with Marxism through the works of the famous Marxist economist Kawahara Kazuo. After returning to China in the summer of 1916, he immediately joined the burgeoning New Culture Movement and later, together with other advanced intellectuals, led the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal May Fourth Patriotic Movement. During this period, inspired by the October Revolution and further study of Marxism, as well as the revolutionary practice of the May Fourth Movement, Li Dazhao's worldview and political stance underwent a transformation from evolutionism to historical materialism and from revolutionary democracy to communism.

From this point on, Li Dazhao vigorously promoted Marxism in China, laying the theoretical and ideological groundwork for the founding of the Communist Party of China. He wrote famous essays such as "My View on Marxism," "Material Change and Moral Change," "The Economic Causes of the Recent Changes in Chinese Thought," and "The Economic Theories of Marx," which comprehensively introduced the basic contents of the three main components of Marxism. Marx used historical materialism to study the economic phenomena of capitalist society and wrote the immortal work "Capital." When Li Dazhao introduced the key points of "Capital," he mainly expounded on the theory of surplus value, which exposes the secret of capitalist exploitation of workers, and the theory of capital accumulation, which reveals the inevitable trend of the demise of private ownership. He said: "The trend of capitalism towards self-destruction is also a natural force, an inevitable outcome." What will replace capitalist private ownership is the new "collective ownership" system, that is, socialist public ownership (Vol. 2, pp. 84-85). Because Marx discovered historical materialism and established the theory of surplus value, socialism went from being a utopian idea to a scientific one. Li Dazhao pointed out in his introduction to the theory of scientific socialism: "The inevitability of socialism" has a solid scientific basis.

After the founding of the Communist Party of China, Li Dazhao, as one of its founders, strongly advocated using Marxism to study the practical problems of the Chinese revolution. In an article he wrote to commemorate Marx's birthday, he pointed out: "We should use Marx's historical materialism to study how China's current political and economic situation came to be, and how we should carry out the movement for national independence to save China from the oppression of the great powers." (Vol. 2, pp. 711-712). Li Dazhao pioneered the practice of combining Marxist basic principles with Chinese revolutionary practice in the history of our party and personally practiced it, studying a series of fundamental problems facing the Chinese revolution.

First, Li Dazhao profoundly discussed the necessity, political and economic characteristics, and measures that should be taken for the socialist system, and propagated the superiority of socialism. In his essays "From Vertical Organization to Horizontal Organization," "Economic Organization under Socialism," and "Doubt about Socialism" written between 1920 and 1923, he elaborated on these issues. Li Dazhao pointed out that the socialist system is born out of capitalist society. The emergence of socialism is like a chick hatching from an egg; once its feathers are fully grown, it naturally has to break out of the capitalist shell.

According to Li Dazhao's opinion, a proletarian dictatorship state must establish its own economic organization and completely reform the economic organization of the former bourgeois dictatorship state. "In essence, it is necessary to find a new method to replace the old-style competitive economic order and organization, so that society can see a new economic organization and order that is regular and superior." (Vol. 2, p. 376). The economic functions of a socialist state have two aspects: one is to realize the socialization of production and exchange institutions, and the other is to rationally organize social production, exchange, and distribution. To this end, the following measures and policies should be adopted: all important means of production and production exchange institutions should be nationalized; eliminate the relationship of domination and subordination, and establish a relationship of equal and free association; develop production rationally and in a planned manner, so that social production meets the consumption needs of the public; manage things instead of people, use science, cooperation, and natural forces to organize production economically; everyone should work to the best of their ability, and labor will become a pleasant thing; implement fair distribution, and everyone will enjoy a rich material and spiritual life; socialist countries should develop their economies independently, and advanced socialist countries should help backward countries; socialist countries should still retain monetary relations as a means of exchanging goods and as a tool for calculating social economy; utilize the bourgeoisie with management experience, and implement a "compensation" policy for them; and so on. Although Li Dazhao's opinions have some inaccuracies, they are basically correct.

Second, based on his analysis of the development trends of the times, Li Dazhao believed that in today's world situation, China must implement socialism to revitalize its economy. This important conclusion was made in his two essays "Industry under Socialism" and "Chinese Socialism and World Capitalism" written in 1921. First, "because the economic situation in China cannot be separated from the world economic forces. Now the world's economic organization has already developed from capitalism to socialism," reaching the point where socialism must be jointly operated, it would be against the development trend of the times to implement capitalism again. Secondly, from China's own situation, on the one hand, imperialist countries do not allow the development of Chinese national capitalism, and on the other hand, "the general public's acceptance of the oppression of the capitalist economic organization is even more painful than the direct oppression of the labor class in various countries by capitalism." Therefore, under this situation, "to protect the capitalist system, whether it is reasonable or not, it is also impossible." "Today, in order to develop industry in China, it is necessary to organize the government purely by producers to eliminate the plundering class within the country, resist the world's capitalism, and operate industry according to the organization of socialism." (Vol. 2, pp. 454-455). "The revival of Chinese industry must be achieved through the implementation of socialism." (Vol. 2, p. 446)

Finally, Li Dazhao also proposed, based on the basic principles of Marxism and the national conditions of China, the development path of advancing towards socialism through democratic revolution. In his article "Postscript to 'National Form and Youth'" written in 1920, he pointed out that we are not just seeking to overthrow a monarchical system, but to move towards world unity. After achieving victory in the democratic revolution, "immediately followed by socialism," is a process towards world unity (Vol. 1, p. 604). However, the current task is to carry out an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national democratic revolution.

    社会主义之来临是“历史的命令”
    ——读《李大钊文集》
    季华
    一百年前即1889年，中国革命史上的一位伟人诞生了，他就是中国共产主义运动先驱和伟大的马克思主义者李大钊。中国共产党成立前夕，他在一篇文章中写道：“社会主义的社会，无论人愿要他不愿要他，他的运命的必然出现，这是历史的命令。”“今社会主义既立在人类历史的必然行程上，有具有绝大势力的历史为其支撑者；那么社会主义之来临，乃如夜之继日，地球环绕太阳的事实一样确实了。”（《李大钊文集》下卷，第334页）这是李大钊经过长期革命实践，钻研马克思主义，不断进行探索，在中国历史转折时刻得出的结论。　　李大钊开始是一位爱国主义者和革命民主主义者。他拥护辛亥革命，并寄予希望。但为时不久，袁世凯篡国窃权，革命半途夭折，中国社会政治经济状况依然如旧。他写了一些文章，揭露当时的中国名为资产阶级共和，实为封建专制。中国的出路何在？由于当时李大钊的世界观和方法论仍然是达尔文的进化论，同时西方资产阶级政治经济思想对他有较大影响。因此，李大钊改造“白首中华”和创建“青春中华”的方案只能向西方寻找，期望像当时欧美和日本那些列强一样，建立一个西方式的资本关系充分发展的、以资产阶级和大土地所有者为社会中心势力的资产阶级共和国。
    然而，李大钊对这个资产阶级共和国的方案也半信半疑：“其良其否，难以确知，其存其易，亦未可测。”（上卷，第168页），李大钊仍在反思，在探索一条能够真正拯救中华民族的新道路。
    1917年，俄国十月革命一声炮响，开辟了人类历史的新纪元，给中国人民送来了马克思主义。在此以前，李大钊留学日本时就通过著名马克思主义经济学家河上肇博士的著作，开始接触了马克思主义。他在1916年夏回国后，立即投入正在兴起的新文化运动，后来又与其他先进知识分子一道领导了反帝反封建的五四爱国运动。在这一时期，由于十月革命的鼓舞，进一步学习了马克思主义，以及五四运动的革命实践，李大钊的世界观和政治立场完成了从进化论到唯物史观、从革命民主主义到共产主义的转变。
    从这时开始，李大钊在我国大力进行了马克思主义的启蒙宣传，为中国共产党的诞生作了理论上思想上的准备。他写的《我的马克思主义观》、《物质变动与道德变动》、《由经济上解释中国近代思想变动的原因》和《马克思的经济学说》等著名论文，全面介绍了马克思主义的三个主要组成部分的基本内容。马克思运用唯物史观研究资本主义社会的经济现象，写下了不朽著作《资本论》。李大钊在介绍《资本论》中的要点时，主要阐述了揭破资本家剥削工人秘密的剩余价值理论和揭示私有制必然灭亡趋势的资本积累理论。他说：“资本主义趋于自灭，也是自然之势，也是不可免之数了。”代替资本主义私有制的将是新的“集产制度”即社会主义公有制（下卷，第84—85页）。由于马克思发现了唯物史观和创立了剩余价值理论，社会主义从空想变成了科学。李大钊在介绍科学社会主义学说时指出：“社会主义必然到来”，这一论断是有其坚固的科学依据的。
    中国共产党成立以后，作为党的创始人之一的李大钊，极力倡导以马克思主义为指导来研究中国革命的实际问题。他为纪念马克思诞生日而写的一篇短文中指出：我们应该“依马克思的唯物史观以研究怎样成了中国今日政治经济的情状，我们应该怎样去作民族独立的运动，把中国从列强压迫之下救济出来。”（下卷，第711—712页）李大钊在我党历史上开创了把马克思主义基本原理同中国革命实践结合起来的先河，并且身体力行，研究中国革命面临的一系列基本问题。
    首先，李大钊深刻地论述了社会主义制度的必然性、政治经济特征和应该实行的措施，宣传了社会主义的优越性。他在1920—1923年间写的《由纵的组织向横的组织》、《社会主义下的经济组织》和《社会主义释疑》等论文，详细阐述了这些问题。李大钊指出，社会主义制度是从资本主义社会里孕育出来的。社会主义之发生，恰是鸡子在卵壳里发生一样，一旦羽毛丰满，自然也非打破资本主义这个壳不可。
    按照李大钊的意见，无产阶级专政的国家必须建立自己的经济组织，对原来资产阶级专政国家的经济组织进行“完全改革”，“其实质方面又须寻出一种新方法，代替旧式之私竞的经济秩序及组织，使社会上发见新的经济组织及秩序是正规而优良者”（下卷，第376页）。社会主义国家的经济职能有两个方面：一是实现生产交换机构的社会化，二是合理地组织社会生产、交换、分配。为此，应该采取以下措施和方针：一切重要生产资料和生产交换机构收归国有；破除统治与服从的关系，建立平等自由联合的关系；有计划地合理地发展生产，使社会的生产符合公众的消费需要；对物的管理代替对人的管理，运用科学、协作、自然力极经济地组织生产；人人各尽所能地做工，劳动将成为一种愉快的事情；实行公平分配，人人享受富裕的物质精神生活；社会主义国家应自主发展经济，先进社会主义国家应帮助落后国家；社会主义仍然要保留货币关系，作为物品的交换手段和充当社会经济的计算工具；利用具有经营管理经验的资产阶级，对他们实行“赔金”政策；等等。李大钊的这些意见，虽说有若干不甚精当之处，但基本上是正确的。
    第二，李大钊根据对时代发展潮流的分析，认为在今日世界形势下，中国要振兴经济，非实行社会主义不可。这个重要结论是他在1921年写的《社会主义下的实业》和《中国的社会主义与世界的资本主义》这两篇论文中作出的。首先，“因为中国的经济情形，实不能超出于世界经济势力之外。现在世界的经济组织，既已经资本主义以至社会主义”，“发达到必须社会主义共营地位”，再实行资本主义就违反时代发展的潮流了。其次，从中国自身的情况来看，一方面帝国主义国家不允许中国民族资本主义的发展，另一方面“一般平民间接受资本主义经济组织的压迫，较各国直接受资本主义压迫的劳动阶级尤其痛苦。”所以，在这种形势下，中国“想行保护资本家的制度，无论理所不可，抑且势所不能。”“今日在中国想发展实业，非由纯粹生产者组织政府，以铲除国内的掠夺阶级，抵抗此世界的资本主义，依社会主义的组织经营实业不可。”（下卷，第454—455页）“中国实业之振兴，必在社会主义之实行。”（下卷，第446页）
    最后，李大钊还根据马克思主义基本原理和我国国情，提出了经过民主革命走向社会主义的发展道路。他写于1920年的《〈国体与青年〉跋》一文中指出，我们不是单求打倒一个君主国体就算了事，而是要走向世界大同。在获得民主革命胜利以后，“紧接着社会主义”，就是走向世界大同的全路程中的一个进程（上卷，第604页）。但是，当前的任务是进行反帝反封建的民族民主革命。
