Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 25th.

The reporter learned that China will resume the National Football Championship starting next year. This is in preparation for the Asian Football Champions Cup.

It is understood that currently, there are two major football tournaments in the Asian region: the "Asian Cup" and the "Club Cup." The Asian Football Confederation has decided to start the "Champions Cup" from next year, and the participating teams must be the champions of their respective national championships.

In the 1950s and 1960s, China held the National Football Championship, which was later suspended. The National Football Championship next year will be participated in by the 8 teams from the A group of this year's first-class league and the top 4 teams from the B group. The competition will be divided into two stages, held in the first and second halves of the year, using a double-elimination system. The team that wins the National Football Championship will have the qualification to represent China in the Asian "Champions Cup."
