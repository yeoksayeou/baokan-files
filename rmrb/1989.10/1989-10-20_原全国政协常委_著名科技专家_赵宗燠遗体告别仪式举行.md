He devoted his entire life to these endeavors, making significant contributions. He advocated for the development of the "fifth energy" (energy conservation) in China and, together with other prominent energy scientists, founded the Beijing Energy Society. He supported, proposed, and oversaw the drafting of the society's recommendation to the central government to implement "daylight saving time," which, after adoption, yielded significant economic benefits.

Zhao Zongye was also a well-known social activist. He loved his country, socialism, and the Communist Party of China, and continuously pursued progress throughout his life.

He consistently aligned his thoughts and actions with the Party Central Committee.

Zhao Zongye was humble and frugal. He was rigorous in his scholarship and diligent in his studies. Although he was highly respected, he was approachable and patient in teaching others.
