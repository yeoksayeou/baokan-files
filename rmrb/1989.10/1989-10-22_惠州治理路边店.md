Over the past two months, the Huizhou Municipal Government in Guangdong Province has organized the departments of industry and commerce, public security, and traffic to conduct a comprehensive cleanup and rectification of over 900 roadside food stalls along the main highways within its jurisdiction. A total of 253 illegal roadside food stalls were shut down, 163 law-abiding and civilized roadside food stalls were approved to continue operating, and some have voluntarily ceased operations or converted to other businesses.

Huizhou City is adjacent to Shenzhen and borders Hong Kong. The Guangshao, Guangmei, and Huishen highways pass through the counties (districts) of Boluo, Huicheng, and Huidong within the city. The total length of the main highways within the city is 357 kilometers. In recent years, with the development of the tourism industry, the volume of traffic on the highways has surged, and the number of travelers has increased, leading to a rapid proliferation of roadside food stalls. Some stall owners, in pursuit of excessive profits, have engaged in illegal operations. Some roadside stalls have become dens of iniquity, while others have become hotbeds for prostitution, the sale of obscene videos, and gambling, seriously disrupting social order and corrupting social morals.

Currently, a batch of roadside food stalls that use indecent means to attract customers and engage in illegal and criminal activities such as prostitution, extortion, price gouging, and gambling have been dealt with by relevant departments according to the severity of their offenses. Female service staff from other provinces who were hired in violation of regulations have all been dismissed. Nearly 100 illegally constructed food stalls that obstructed traffic have been demolished. The practice of stopping vehicles on the road to solicit customers has been effectively curbed.

　　惠州治理路边店
    近两个月来，广东省惠州市政府为了净化社会风气，组织工商、公安、交通等部门，对辖区内主要公路干线上的900多间路边饮食店进行全面的清理整顿，共取缔违法经营的路边饮食店253个，有163个文明守法的路边饮食店被批准继续开业，另有一些自行停业或转办他业。
    惠州市与深圳市接壤，毗邻香港。广汕、广梅、惠深等公路穿过该市的博罗、惠城、惠东等县（区），境内主要公路干线共长357公里。近几年来，随着旅游业的发展，公路车流量猛增，旅客增多，路边饮食店迅速兴起。一些路边店店主为了牟取暴利，违法经营，有一些路边店成了藏污纳垢场所，有的成了卖淫嫖娼、播放淫秽录像、聚赌等活动的黑窝，严重扰乱社会治安，毒化社会风气。
    目前，一批用色情招徕顾客，有嫖娼卖淫、敲诈勒索、哄抬物价、聚众赌博等违法犯罪活动的路边饮食店及其店主，有关部门已按不同情节对其作了查处；违反规定雇诱的外省女服务员已全部清退；近百间违章搭建、影响交通的饮食店被拆除；上路拦车拉客的现象被有效制止。
