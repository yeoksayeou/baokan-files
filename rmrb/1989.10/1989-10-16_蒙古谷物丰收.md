Mongolia has had a bountiful grain harvest this year, with the harvesting work already completed, yielding a total of 1.811 million tons of grain.

According to a report from the Mongolian News Agency, this spring and summer, Mongolia's agricultural regions experienced relatively dry weather, which had an adverse effect on the germination and growth of crops. In mid-September, an unusual heavy snowfall occurred, affecting the grain harvesting work. However, due to the hard work of the farmers, a good harvest was still achieved.

Currently, Mongolia has 1.3 million hectares of cultivated land, practicing a crop rotation system, with wheat as the main crop. Agricultural production has been mechanized, and although the grain yield per unit area is relatively low, the grain produced not only meets domestic needs but can also be exported abroad. In recent years, Mongolia has been promoting intensive grain cultivation techniques on one hand, and vigorously promoting contract and lease systems on the other. This year, 70% of farmers have signed contract and lease agreements with agricultural and pastoral stations.

    蒙古谷物丰收
    新华社乌兰巴托10月15日电　蒙古今年谷物丰收，收割工作已经结束，共收获谷物181.1万吨。
    据蒙通社报道，今年春夏蒙古农作区天气较为干旱，对庄稼的出苗和生长造成了一定的不利影响，9月中旬又遇到了罕见的大雪，影响了谷物的收割工作，但由于农民们的辛勤劳动，仍获得了较好收成。
    目前，蒙古共有耕地130万公顷，实行轮耕制，以种植小麦为主，农业生产已实现机械化，粮食的单位面积产量虽然较低，但生产的粮食不仅能满足本国需要，而且还可向国外出口。近年来，蒙古一方面推广集约化种植谷物工艺，另一方面大力推广承包和租赁制，今年有70％的农民同农牧场签订了承包和租赁合同。
