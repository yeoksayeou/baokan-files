Title: Asking the Ditch Diggers
Author: Han Xiaoshi
Date: 1989-10-21
Edition: 6

Your newspaper published a letter and photograph on March 25, titled "Can We Ignore Such Obstacles to Traffic?" on the sixth page, criticizing the situation where a large ditch appeared on the road surface at the intersection of Renmin Road and the West (Xi'an) to Baoji (Road) in Xianyang, Shaanxi, and no one was taking responsibility. Shortly after the publication, this ditch was filled, and passing vehicles and pedestrians finally breathed a sigh of relief.

However, this good situation did not last long. Starting two months ago, this area has been dug up and is now full of potholes, apparently in preparation for road widening. But the work stopped after a few days, and after several recent rains, this place has become a muddy swamp. Not only is it difficult to drive, but even walking is challenging. It is not uncommon for vehicles from out of town to get stuck here.

This "sore spot" in the key traffic area has been like this for over a year. I ask the ditch diggers: Are we going to let this ditch drag on into a third year? Repairing a mere 200 meters of road surface should not be too difficult. The key is whether there is the will to do it.

### 试问挖沟人

　　试问挖沟人
    你报3月25日第六版以《有碍交通的事岂能撒手不管》为题刊登读者来信和照片，对陕西咸阳市人民路与西（安）宝（鸡）公路连接处路面出现大沟无人管的情况进行批评。见报不久，这条拦路沟被填平，过往车辆行人总算松了口气。
    可是好景不长，从两个月前开始，这里又被挖得坑坑洼洼，看样子是准备拓宽路面。但动工不几天又停了下来，最近几场雨后，这里简直成了一片泥沼，莫说行车，连步行都很困难。外地车辆途经此处陷进其中的事时有发生。
    这处交通“咽喉”地段的“溃疡”已一年有余。试问挖沟人：难道还让这沟跨入第三个年头吗？区区200米路面的修复应该不是一件太难的事，关键在于有没有决心。
