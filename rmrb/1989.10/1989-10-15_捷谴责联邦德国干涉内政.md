Czechoslovak News Agency, Prague, October 14th.

Czechoslovakia condemns West German interference in domestic affairs. The Czechoslovak News Agency issued a statement condemning West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for interfering in Czechoslovakia's internal affairs.

On October 10th, at the opening ceremony of the 41st Frankfurt Book Fair in Frankfurt am Main, Kohl announced that West German publishers would award a "Peace Prize" worth 25,000 Marks to Czech "dissident" and playwright Václav Havel. He also expressed the hope that "the winds of freedom will one day blow into Czechoslovakia."

The statement, published in the October 14th issue of the *Red Rights Newspaper*, pointed out that Kohl's remarks about Czechoslovakia "reminded one of the language of the Cold War era, violating the spirit and provisions of the 1973 agreement between the two countries and the Helsinki Accords."

    捷谴责联邦德国干涉内政
    新华社布拉格10月14日电　捷通社发表声明，谴责联邦德国总理科尔干涉捷克斯洛伐克内政。
    科尔10月10日在美因河畔法兰克福第41届书展开幕式上宣布把西德书商价值2.5万马克的“和平奖”颁发给捷“持不同政见者”、剧作家哈维尔，并声称希望“自由之风有朝一日也能吹进捷克斯洛伐克”。
    《红色权利报》14日刊登的捷通社声明指出，科尔上述有关捷克斯洛伐克的讲话，“令人想起冷战时期的语言，违背1973年两国关系协定的精神和条文以及欧安会文件”。
