Title: A Window to Clarify Social Doubts – Reading "Seeking Truth in Miscellaneous Discussions"
Author: Yúnshān

Edition: 8

This title is the impression I got after reading "Seeking Truth in Miscellaneous Discussions" (published by Xinhua Publishing House). People live in society, especially in our society, and when they encounter difficult problems, they can always find solutions. On a small scale, there are "information desks" at train stations and airports. On a larger scale, there are the class struggle theory and the laws of social development, as explained in the classics of Marxism-Leninism. In daily political, ideological, and cultural life, there are thematic commentaries, ideological essays, and literary and historical miscellaneous discussions.

"Seeking Truth in Miscellaneous Discussions" is a collection of essays from various authors during the seventh five-year plan, a period of significant transformation. Various reforms, transitions, and adjustments are fraught with challenges. In the realms of politics, economics, and culture, there are conflicts in systems, policies, ideologies, state-owned, collective, and individual entities, as well as issues of power, knowledge, personnel, and treatment. Some are rectifying the political climate and suppressing evil influences, while others coexist with both good and evil. Reform and conservatism go hand in hand; joy and complaint are common; flowers and weeds grow together in the same garden. Truly, the country's appearance is changing rapidly, and social problems are emerging one after another. The works collected in this book basically reflect and raise the main social issues that people were most concerned about at the time, as well as the insights of Beijing's miscellaneous essayists and their main achievements during this period.

Matters of the world, the nation, and the family are all interconnected; party discipline, government discipline, and literary style all have their origins. Everyone is concerned with issues that they encounter, see, and experience in daily life, all of which are related to party discipline, government discipline, and literary style. If these problems are not solved, they will affect people's confidence in achieving the "Four Modernizations" and the progress of the "Four Modernizations" cause. To adhere to the four cardinal principles, promote reform, improve the system, eliminate corruption, and build a clean government, the authors have dedicated themselves wholeheartedly, focusing on the big picture while addressing the details, striving for clarity, and proposing solutions to problems from a realistic and feasible perspective. "Seeking truth" embodies the fragrance of the garden of miscellaneous essays. Praise and criticism of new things, various ideas, and different behaviors are appropriate and humorous; distant and near references are relevant and to the point; deep insights are presented in a simple manner, and one example can lead to three conclusions. The emotions are in the text, and the intentions are beyond the words. Through this window, not only can one understand many aspects of society and gain knowledge of life, but one can also appreciate the interest of life.

    社会解惑之窗
    ——读《求实杂谈》
    云山
    这一文题，是初读《求实杂谈》（新华出版社出版）得出的印象。
    人们生活在社会中，特别是在我们的社会里，遇到疑难问题，总能找到解决的所在。小者，在车站、机场，有“询问处”。大者，阶级斗争学说，社会发展规律，有马列主义经典著作。在日常的政治、思想、文化生活中，则有专题评论、思想随笔和文史小品之类的杂谈。
    《求实杂谈》是我国进入第七个五年建设计划，是在又一个具有转变意义时期的诸家杂文。各种更始、交替、转轨，好事多磨。政治、经济、文化各个领域，体制、政策、思想各个范畴，国营、集体、个体各种体制，权力、知识、用人、待遇各种矛盾，或正风压邪气，或正邪并存；改革保守同在；喜气杂怨气，喜怨常见；鲜花掩杂草，花草一园。真可谓祖国面貌日新月异，社会问题层出不穷。这本书收录的作品，基本上反映和提出了当时人们普遍关心的主要社会问题，也反映了北京杂文家们的识力和这期间的主要成绩。
    世事、国事、家事，事事相连；党风、政风、文风，风风有源。人人关心在日常生活中碰得到、看得见、摸得着的事，都是事关党风、政风、文风的事。这些问题不解决，影响到人们对实现“四化”的信心，关系到“四化”大业的进程。为坚持四项基本原则，推进改革，完善体制，清除腐败，建设廉政，作者们丹心一片，大处着眼，小处着笔，力求透辟，从现实可行性提出解决问题的见解。“求实”，体现了百花园杂文的芳香。对新生事物、各种思想、多种行为的褒贬，扬抑适度，谐谑相宜；远征近引，切题而止；深入浅出，举一反三；情在文中，意在笔外。通过这一窗口，不仅可以明了社会的许多事理，增长人生知识，还可品出生活意趣。
