The Bulgarian Esperanto Theater Troupe is a unique artistic group. The troupe does not have a fixed performance venue, and the props used for performances are very simple, adapting to various stages at any time. The actors do not receive salaries from the troupe—they are also directors or actors in other artistic groups. All performances by the troupe are conducted in Esperanto.

Since its establishment in 1958, the troupe has continuously toured around the world, showcasing the construction achievements of socialist Bulgaria to people of various countries and vigorously promoting the common wealth of all humanity—Esperanto culture. The troupe has performed a large number of classic works from the world's dramatic treasures, including works by Shakespeare and Molière. During this period, the troupe participated in 24 Esperanto competitions held in 15 countries, winning the applause of millions of spectators of different races. Esperanto scholars from various countries highly praise the troupe's contributions to the development of Esperanto culture, and artists also give high evaluations to the troupe's artistic achievements.

　　保加利亚世界语剧团
    保加利亚世界语剧团是一个独具特色的艺术团体。该剧团没有固定演出场地，用作演出的道具也非常简单，以适应随时更换的各种舞台；演员们不从剧团领取工资——他们同时都是其它艺术团体的导演或演员。剧团的所有演出都用世界语进行。
    自1958年建团以来，该剧团不断在世界各地举行巡回演出，向各国人民展示社会主义保加利亚的建设成就，同时大力宣扬全人类的共同财富——世界语文化。剧团上演了世界戏剧宝库中的大量经典剧目，包括莎士比亚和莫里哀的作品。其间，剧团参加了在15个国家举办的24次世界语竞赛，赢得成千上万不同肤色观众的喝彩。各国世界语学者高度赞扬该剧团为发展世界语文化所做的贡献，艺术家们也对剧团取得的艺术成就给予很高评价。　（胡）
