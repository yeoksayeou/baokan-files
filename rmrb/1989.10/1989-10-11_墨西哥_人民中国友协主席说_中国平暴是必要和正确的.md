Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, October 8th.

The chairman of the Mexico-China Friendship Association, Bichardo, recently stated here that China's measures to quell the counter-revolutionary riots were necessary and correct.

Bichardo made these remarks in a speech at the association's celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He said that 40 years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed on Tiananmen Square that the Chinese people had stood up. This was a historic and forward-looking statement.

He said that in the process of building socialism, China has encountered various obstacles and problems. However, China has gradually resolved these issues, thereby improving the living standards of one-fifth of the world's population.

Bichardo said that with the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, China is marching towards modernization. However, various obstacles have not disappeared. Hidden enemies and dark forces, both domestic and foreign, exploited the student movements in April and May this year to deliberately instigate political turmoil in Beijing and other cities, which then escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot. Their goal was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the People's Republic of China.

He said that to stabilize the situation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China took painful but extremely important measures. These measures were necessary and correct.

    墨西哥—人民中国友协主席说
    中国平暴是必要和正确的
    新华社墨西哥城10月8日电　墨西哥—人民中国友好协会主席比查尔多最近在这里指出，中国平息反革命暴乱的措施是必要的，正确的。
    比查尔多最近在友协举办的庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年大会上发表讲话时说，40年前，毛泽东主席在天安门广场宣告，中国人民从此站起来了。这是一句改变历史、继往开来的名言。
    他说，在建设社会主义过程中，中国也遇到种种阻力和大小问题。然而，中国逐步解决了这些问题，从而使占人类1／5的居民提高了生活水平。
    比查尔多说，随着执行改革、开放新政策，中国正在向现代化迈进。但是，各种阻力并未消失。暗藏的敌人、国内外各种黑暗势力利用今年4、5月间的学生运动，在北京和其他城市有计划、有预谋地挑起政治动乱，然后又演变为一场反革命暴乱，其目的就是为了推翻中国共产党的领导和颠覆中华人民共和国。
    他说，为了稳定局势，中国共产党中央采取了虽然痛心但是却极为重要的措施。这些措施是必要和正确的。
