The Credentials Committee of the 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly held its first meeting this afternoon and passed a resolution draft recommending that this session of the UNGA accept the credentials of the representatives of Democratic Kampuchea and 124 other countries, thus thwarting the attempt to leave the seat of Cambodia vacant.

During the debate, Soviet representative Podserob argued against accepting the credentials of the Khmer representatives, claiming that "in light of the significant changes in the situation in Cambodia," the seat of Cambodia in the UNGA should be left vacant until internal dialogue in Cambodia is completed.

This view was refuted by representatives of other countries. Chinese representative Yu Mengjia said that for many years, the United Nations has accepted the credentials of the representatives of Democratic Kampuchea, which is correct, because the Khmer is a formal member of the United Nations and is the only legitimate government of Cambodia, while the Heng Samrin regime, which is backed by foreign invading troops, cannot represent the Cambodian people. U.S. representative Rosenstock and Philippine representative Mendez both said that accepting the credentials of the Khmer is obviously normal, and this session of the UNGA should accept them as in previous sessions.

The members of the Credentials Committee are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, China, Colombia, Malawi, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Zaire.

    本届联大证书委员会通过决议草案
    接受民柬代表证书
    本报联合国10月11日电  记者刘开宸报道：第44届联合国大会证书委员会今天下午举行第一次会议，通过了一项决议草案，建议本届联大接受民主柬埔寨等125国代表的证书，粉碎了要把柬埔寨席位空缺的企图。
    辩论时，苏联代表波德塞罗布曾反对接受民柬的证书，说什么“鉴于柬埔寨形势的巨大变化”，要求柬埔寨在联大的席位空缺，直到柬埔寨内部对话完成为止。
    这种意见遭到其它国家代表的驳斥。中国代表俞孟嘉说，多年来，联合国一直接受民主柬埔寨代表的证书，这是正确的，因为，民柬是联合国的正式成员，是柬埔寨唯一合法的政府，而外国侵略军扶持的韩桑林政权根本不能代表柬埔寨人民。美国代表罗森斯托克和菲律宾代表门代兹都说接受民柬证书显然是正常的，本届联大应像过去几届一样地接受。
    证书委员会的成员是安提瓜和巴布达、澳大利亚、中国、哥伦比亚、马拉维、菲律宾、苏联、美国、扎伊尔等9国。
