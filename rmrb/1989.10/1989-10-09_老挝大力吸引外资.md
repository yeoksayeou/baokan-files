In 1986, the Fourth Congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, after summarizing the experience of economic construction over the ten years since liberation in 1975, formulated policies of internal economic reform and external openness. Currently, Laos is focusing on attracting foreign investment and increasing exports to promote national development.

Attracting foreign investment is one of the key tasks in Laos' current economic work. The government's various departments are all working to attract foreign investment. In April of last year, the first investment law of Laos was promulgated and implemented in July of the same year. Subsequently, the Central Investment Management Committee was established, with the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Kaysone Phomvihane, as its chairman, and sub-committees were set up in each province. All foreign investment applications are carefully discussed and decided by the Central Investment Management Committee.

The Lao investment law has a series of clear regulations to attract foreign investment, such as: the Lao government will not expropriate foreign-funded enterprises, will not interfere in the affairs of foreign-funded enterprises, and will allow foreign-funded enterprises to remit their profits.

The investment law also stipulates that foreign capital can establish wholly-owned enterprises in Laos or joint ventures, and the state will not levy taxes on foreign-funded enterprises for the first five years, etc. Recently, Xieng Songthong Xaythamath, Secretary-General of the Lao Central Investment Management Committee, told Chinese reporters that the foreign investment projects currently encouraged by Laos are those that produce export products, utilize local raw materials, build roads, bridges, water conservancy projects, and other basic projects, and earn foreign exchange through service projects. The Lao government particularly welcomes investment in the development of agriculture, livestock, and other agricultural production, and will provide special tax concessions in this regard.

In the past year, Laos has made some achievements and accumulated some experience in attracting foreign investment. According to statistics, so far, a total of 124 foreign investment applications have been received, 70 have been approved, and the registered capital is 5 million US dollars. Among the approved projects, nearly 70% come from Thailand, and other investing countries and regions include Australia, the United States, France, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, and Hong Kong. Phon Bounpone, Deputy Chairman of the Lao Central Investment Management Committee, said that foreign investment has brought capital to Laos, supplemented its strength, and enabled the Lao economy to take "new steps"; it has added new vitality to the production and circulation sectors, and has improved people's lives to a certain extent.

In addition, Laos has introduced some advanced science, technology, and production methods, created employment opportunities for young people, and trained specialized talents.

The reporter visited the "Lao Modern Garment Factory," a Thai-Lao joint venture located about five kilometers southeast of Vientiane, which has only 180 workers. Last year, it earned 450,000 US dollars in foreign exchange, and in the first eight months of this year, it has already earned 370,000 US dollars. The factory's products are exported to Canada, the Netherlands, West Germany, and other countries.

While vigorously attracting foreign investment, Laos is also paying attention to guarding against the negative influences that come with it.

For this reason, Laos firmly opposes the establishment of gambling and pornographic service establishments by foreigners in Laos. The tourism industry operated by foreigners in Laos should take the promotion of excellent traditional culture and art as its purpose. To unify guidance, a national tourism organization has been established, and all provincial tourism departments must accept its leadership.

Due to lack of experience, Laos' work in attracting foreign investment still needs to be adjusted and improved, and there are problems such as incomplete regulations and unclear division of responsibilities between the central and local governments. Laos is vast and sparsely populated, with abundant resources that have not yet been developed. The continuous inflow of foreign capital has injected new vitality into this small landlocked country.

According to some economic experts here, in the future, foreign investment projects in Laos will continue to increase, which will undoubtedly inject new vitality into the development of the Lao economy and the improvement of people's lives.

    老挝大力吸引外资
    新华社记者　黄勇　本报记者　刘爱成
    1986年，老挝人民革命党第四次代表大会上在总结了1975年解放以来十年经济建设经验后，制定了对内经济改革，对外开放的政策。目前老挝正集中力量吸引外资，增加出口，以求国家的发展。
    大力吸引外资是老挝党和政府现阶段经济工作的重点之一。政府各部门的对外工作都在围绕着吸引外资进行。去年4月颁布、同年7月施行了老挝的第一个投资法。接着设立了中央投资管理委员会，由部长会议主席凯山·丰威汉任主席，各省设分会。凡是外资申请项目，均由中央投资管理委员会认真讨论研究，而后决定取舍。
    老挝投资法有一系列吸引外资的明确规定，如：老挝政府将不没收外资企业，不干涉外资企业的事务，允许外资企业汇出所获利润。
    投资法还规定，外资可在老挝设独资企业，也可建合资企业，国家将在头5年不向外资企业征税等等。老挝中央投资管理委员会秘书长西宋吞·西提莫拉达最近在这里对中国记者说，目前老挝鼓励的外资项目是生产出口产品、利用本地原料的项目，建设公路、桥梁、水利工程的基础项目和赚取外汇的服务性项目。老挝政府尤其欢迎在发展种植、畜牧等农业生产的项目方面的投资，在征税方面将给予特别优惠。
    一年多来，老挝在吸引外资方面取得一些成果，积累一些经验。据统计，到目前为止，共接收外资申请项目124项，批准70项，注册资本500万美元。批准的项目中近70％来自泰国，其它投资的国家和地区包括澳大利亚、美国、法国、日本、新加坡、印尼和香港。老挝中央投资管理委员会常务副主席炮·本纳喷说，外国的投资为老挝输送了资本，补充了力量，使老挝经济迈开了“新的步伐”；为生产和流通领域增添了新的活力，使人民生活有了一定的改善。
    此外，老挝还引进了一些先进科学、技术和生产方法，为年轻人创造了就业机会，培养了专门人才。
    记者参观的位于万象市东南五公里处的泰老私人合资“老挝现代成衣厂”仅有180名工人，去年创汇45万美元，今年头8个月已创汇37万美元。该厂产品远销加拿大、荷兰、西德等国。
    老挝在大力吸引外资的同时，注意抵御随之而来的外国不良影响。
    为此，老挝坚决不同意外商在老挝设立赌博性、色情性的服务业场所。外商在老挝开办的旅游业要以发扬优秀传统文化艺术为宗旨。为了统一指导，设立了全国性旅游机构，各省旅游部门均须接受其领导。
    由于经验不足，老挝吸引外资的工作还需要进行调整和改进，存在法规不健全，中央和地方管理任务不明确等问题。老挝地广人稀，资源丰富且尚未开发。不断而来的外资给这个小小的内陆国家增添了生机。
    据此间一些经济专家估计，今后到老挝投资的外资项目将继续增加，这必将为老挝经济的发展和人民生活的改善注入新的活力。
