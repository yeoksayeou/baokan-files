The Xigu Oil Station in our city is a large-scale oil storage enterprise responsible for the distribution of oil to seven provinces and regions in the northwest and southwest, with a total storage capacity of tens of thousands of cubic meters. In 1987, a few villagers from the Taoyuan Village in the Xigu District built a shrine to the Virgin Mary just 6 meters away from the oil depot's perimeter wall. Since then, the place has been bustling with people burning incense and praying, and the sound of firecrackers never stops, posing a serious threat to the safety of the oil depot. The Xigu Oil Station has repeatedly negotiated with the shrine's caretakers and the villagers of Taoyuan Village, and has also reported the issue to the relevant authorities. However, the shrine's activities have only increased, and it has even been expanded. During the shrine's monthly grand ceremonies, the flying sparks from the firecrackers and the scattered cigarette butts pose an imminent danger of igniting the oil depot.

    圣母宫神庙香火不断  西固石油站面临火灾
    我市西固石油站是肩负西北、西南7省区石油调拨任务的较大型储油企业，总储油数万立方米。1987年西固区桃园村少数村民在距油库中心区围墙仅6米的地方，修起圣母宫神庙。从此，这里烧香拜佛者络绎不绝，鞭炮声响个不停，严重威胁油库安全。西固石油站曾多次与神庙的主持及桃园村的村民交涉，也曾向有关部门报告过，然而神庙香火日甚，而且还陆续扩建。神庙每月举行隆重“大礼”时，飞溅的鞭炮，遍地的烟头，随时都有引爆油库的危险。
