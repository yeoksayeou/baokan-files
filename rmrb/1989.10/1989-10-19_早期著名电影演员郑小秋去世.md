Zheng Xiaqiu, originally named Zheng Hongbin, entered the film industry at the age of 5. At 12, he successfully portrayed the orphan Yu Pu in the first Chinese feature film "Orphan Rescues Ancestor," directed by his father, renowned film artist Zheng Zhengqiu, and Zhang Shichuan. This performance caused a sensation and made him a famous child star. In the early 1930s, he partnered with Hu Die to star in films such as "Laughing and Crying Marriage" and "Sisters in Arms." As one of China's early film actors, Zheng Xiaqiu experienced the transition from silent films to talkies, participating in the performance and direction of nearly a hundred feature films, contributing to China's film industry.

After liberation, Zheng Xiaqiu followed the party's arrangements and devoted himself to the educational film industry, directing over 40 films, including excellent educational films such as "Water and Soil Conservation," "Protecting Draft Animals," "Chinese Martial Arts," and "Writing with a Brush Pen."

Over 200 film industry professionals attended the memorial service held on October 11.
