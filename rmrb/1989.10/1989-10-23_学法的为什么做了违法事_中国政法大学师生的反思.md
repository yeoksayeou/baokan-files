As students of a law school, we should model exemplary compliance with laws and regulations, and be staunch defenders of socialist legal system. However, the reality is not as ideal. Since the beginning of the semester, students of China University of Political Science and Law, under the guidance of our teachers, have studied the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Comrade Jiang Zemin, and learned about the true facts from the turmoil to the counter-revolutionary rebellion. We have calmly reflected on these events. Painful as it is, some students have realized that in this political storm, we, as law students, have submitted a failing report card.

Why did we fail this test of political struggle? Why did those who study law end up breaking the law? Students of China University of Political Science and Law have linked the causes to their own experiences and deeply analyzed the reasons.

First, there was a mistaken understanding of the spirit of the legal system and the spirit of our constitution, which led to a separation of rights from duties, and of democracy and freedom from the legal system. This resulted in using illegal means to defend the dignity of the law.

If we say that all the students of China University of Political Science and Law who were involved in the turmoil intentionally trampled on the law, this would contradict the good intentions of those innocent students. For the vast majority of students who were drawn into the turmoil, the opposite is true. They considered the dignity of the law and recognized the importance of the legal system, and with the attitude of knowing the law, they went to "protect the law."

The most frequently chanted slogan by the students of China University of Political Science and Law was: "China University of Political Science and Law, China University of Political Science and Law, the law is greater than power. To protect the law, we fear not beheading." On April 22, while the funeral of Comrade Hu Yaobang was being held, students of China University of Political Science and Law held up a sign that had a significant impact, which read: "Article 35 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China: Citizens of the People's Republic of China have freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, procession, and demonstration. Article 37: The personal freedom of citizens of the People's Republic of China is inviolable. Unlawful detention and other unlawful methods of depriving or restricting citizens' personal freedom are prohibited." On April 27, during the parade, China University of Political Science and Law held up a banner that read: "Solemnly defend the dignity of the constitution." Here, we cannot rule out the possibility that a few people with ulterior motives were involved, but for the vast majority of students who carried signs, held up banners, and shouted slogans, it was out of goodwill and naivety.

We must recognize this fact: the "protection of the law" by the students of China University of Political Science and Law was targeted, specifically against the "Ten Regulations on Parades and Demonstrations in Beijing" (hereinafter referred to as the "Ten Regulations") formulated by the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress. A student from the Law School of China University of Political Science and Law said: "We only saw the textual differences between the 'Ten Regulations' and the Constitution, saw that the additional provisions of the 'Ten Regulations' on Article 35 of the Constitution were not from the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee, and arbitrarily assumed that the 'Ten Regulations' were unconstitutional. Therefore, we went to protect the law and went to parade and demonstrate." Students naively believed that the rights granted by the law were unrestricted rights, and the freedoms stipulated by the law were absolute and unlimited freedoms. They called for democracy and the legal system but could not understand what true democracy and the legal system were. They forgot the basic legal theory taught in the first semester of their freshman year, where teachers clearly taught the relationship between rights and duties, and freedom and the legal system. Citizens, while enjoying the rights stipulated by the law, must also fulfill the duties stipulated by the law (these duties include the duty to abide by the state constitution and laws). There are no rights without duties, and there are no duties without rights. Citizens' freedoms must be limited within the scope stipulated by the law. There is no absolute, unlimited freedom above the law. Freedom is not the same as willfulness; it always requires adherence to certain laws. Therefore, all clauses about citizens' rights and freedoms in the world stipulate additional conditions for freedom. Our democracy is socialist democracy, which must be realized through the legal system. Unrestricted, doing as one pleases, is extreme democratization and anarchism, which will inevitably lead to social disorder, and the democratic system that people yearn for will not be realized. Such basic legal principles and the spirit of the law were only superficially understood, not thoroughly comprehended, or ignored or forgotten, leading to a one-sided understanding of the constitution and laws, and showing a harmful tendency to trample on the law. Some people said, "Doesn't the constitution stipulate that citizens have the freedom to assemble, parade, and demonstrate? Then why not freely exercise this right?" In the face of such a one-sided and superficial understanding of the law, all concepts of duty became pale and powerless. What constraints, what limitations, what interpretations, what order, what stability, all disappeared. What is even more heartbreaking is that such trampling on the constitution was done under the emotional control of defending the dignity of the constitution. Students who study the law but do not know they are breaking the law, and what they hold high is the banner of protecting the law. Under such emotional control, there is no deep and calm self-reflection. They are lenient with themselves but strict with others, criticizing the government in every way, seeking harshness. Students simply thought that any restriction and constraint on the freedoms stipulated by the constitution were in conflict with the constitution, so the "Ten Regulations" were unconstitutional. They forgot that our constitution, while stipulating Article 35 and Article 37 in the general provisions, also stipulates in the specific provisions that "Article 100: The people's congresses of provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and their standing committees may, under the premise of not being in conflict with the constitution, laws, and administrative regulations, formulate local regulations and submit them to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for the record." Local regulations, in the local area, have the same legal effect as the various laws of the state. The "Ten Regulations" are additional provisions to Article 35 of our constitution and are legally binding local regulations. Because students did not fully understand the spirit and essence of the constitution, did not solidly grasp the basic legal theory, and emphasized the general provisions over the specific provisions, they were blinded by one leaf and could not see the whole mountain. They considered themselves as knowing the law but acted as if they did not understand the law. Under the banner of protecting the law, they did things that were contrary to their wishes and trampled on the legal system and violated the law.

Second, there was a lack of responsibility as law students, only seeking legal grounds for one's own actions in a one-sided manner, looking for loopholes in the law, and avoiding the legal provisions that restrict personal behavior.

Some students of China University of Political Science and Law said that we study the law but do not know how to maintain the dignity of the law. We have even forgotten that modeling exemplary compliance with laws and regulations is a sacred duty bestowed upon us by the Party, the people, and our profession. On the contrary, at a time when we should take the lead in complying with the law, we thought we were smart and looked for loopholes in the law.

Students said that we only saw the positive and good side of people shouting "Down with official profiteering" and "Eliminate corruption," and were moved by everyone's patriotic enthusiasm. Thus, we isolatedly held up that sign with the 35th and 37th articles of the constitution, seeking legal grounds for illegal assemblies, parades, and demonstrations, and naively legitimizing those illegal behaviors. However, we avoided the legal provisions that restrict personal behavior. For example, Article 51 of the constitution states: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China, when exercising their freedoms and rights, must not infringe upon the interests of the state, society, collectives, and the lawful freedoms and rights of other citizens." On April 22, during the funeral of Comrade Hu Yaobang, the farce on Tiananmen Square almost prevented the funeral from proceeding normally. Such an assembly, even without the "Ten Regulations" of Beijing City and without the special regulations of the Tiananmen Square Management Office regarding assemblies on the square, could still find its illegal basis in our country's fundamental law. That illegal assembly had seriously affected the interests of our state and society and was intolerable by the constitution. The so-called "hunger strike" that began on May 13 and the subsequent support parades disrupted the important ceremony of Gorbachev's visit to China, which could not proceed as planned. Such a major state affair that attracted global attention was interfered with and disrupted, how could it be said not to violate the constitution? For example, after May 17, some teachers and students of China University of Political Science and Law occupied the Xinhua Gate for a long time, which seriously affected the normal performance of duties by the Party and state leaders and state functionaries, damaged our country's reputation, how could it be said not to be illegal? Students called for the legal system, always blaming our country's legal system for being imperfect, but when the law had no loopholes to exploit, they clumsily created loopholes to exploit. How shallow their legal system concepts were!

The Third Session of the Fifth National People's Congress decided on September 10, 1980, to abolish the original Article 45 of the constitution regarding citizens' "right to use 'speak out, air views fully, write big-character posters, and hold great debates'" and the Beijing Daily published an article: "Big-character posters are not protected by law." However, in the previous few years, there were big-character posters in the campus of China University of Political Science and Law, signed by "Constitution Lovers." The author nitpicked and said: The constitution abolished the "four bigs," but flipping through all the constitutional articles, there was no prohibition on the "four bigs." The absence of prohibitive articles means that big-character posters are not unconstitutional, they are just not protected by law. Another big-character poster later said that the constitution does not protect the rights of those who write big-character posters, but it also does not stipulate the protection of those who tear down big-character posters. They did not know that since the constitution does not protect big-character posters, people have the right to stop big-character posters. Big-character posters and small-character posters are remnants of the Cultural Revolution. The ten years of turmoil proved that big and small character posters are tools for irresponsible personal attacks, spreading rumors, and fabricating false, wrong, and mistaken cases. They have caused harm to many people. If it were not for insufficient recognition of the harm of the Cultural Revolution or nostalgia for the Cultural Revolution, big and small character posters would not arouse sympathy. Our criminal law Article 145 stipulates that it is not allowed to "use 'big-character posters,' 'small-character posters' to publicly insult others or fabricate facts to defame others." The big and small character posters that appeared in this turmoil were mostly about insulting and defaming Party and state leaders, and they were also the main media for spreading rumors. Some people found excuses and said: Currently, our democratic channels are not smooth, and big and small character posters are needed to supplement them. We admit that our political system is not perfect and our democratic system is not complete, but our Party has made various efforts to understand the situation below through dialogue with various strata, reporting, letters and visits, etc. What we should do is to reflect problems through legal channels and gradually make the legal system perfect, and we cannot adopt illegal and loophole-exploiting methods to disrupt social stability.

Third, a strong sense of being in the limelight diluted weak legal concepts, emphasized vanity, and forgot the interests of the Party, the state, and the collective.

In the previous few years of turmoil, China University of Political Science and Law, under the joint efforts of the school Party committee, teachers, and students, maintained stability and did not get involved. Some students with confused ideas not only did not take this as a source of pride but even thought it was a shame to lack the so-called "participation consciousness." Some students even felt inferior and thought they were not as good as others. Under the influence of this idea, some students of China University of Political Science and Law, in this turmoil, racked their brains, innovated, and showed off.

On the afternoon of April 17, some teachers and students of China University of Political Science and Law were the first to organize a team to go to Tiananmen Square, opening the precedent for illegal parades in this turmoil. Some students, after returning from the parade, were proud of their "daring to be the first in the world" glory. They also knew that parades without the approval and registration of the public security organs were illegal and risky actions. However, abnormal emotions controlled them, and the banner of "speaking for the people" encouraged them. They no longer cared about the law, as long as they could fully display their strong "participation consciousness," the law could become a mere piece of paper. Some teachers and students held positions in a few illegal organizations. The "High Autonomy Federation" held a press conference for domestic and foreign journalists at China University of Political Science and Law, which seriously affected the reputation of China University of Political Science and Law, but some confused students did not analyze and simply thought that this enhanced the reputation of China University of Political Science and Law; some people went to the Xinhua Gate to hunger strike and stop drinking water, damaging our country's image and interests, but those who did not understand thought it was a just act of patriotism. Students often complained about others' shallow legal concepts and deeply hated the phenomenon of having laws but not following them. However, more than 50 days of practice showed that this problem also existed among the students themselves. Not knowing the law and breaking the law is an ignorant and blind behavior, but knowing the law and trying it out is a clear and crazy ignorance.

In recent years, the bourgeois liberalization trend has been rampant, and the "self-adulation" and "self-realization" that do not consider social effects have undoubtedly played a crucial role in the formation of this sense of being in the limelight. Students, through learning, realized that showing off like this brought not glory but disgrace to China University of Political Science and Law. It seriously damaged the reputation of China University of Political Science and Law and harmed the interests of the state and the people.

Fourth, the traditional "law does not punish the crowd" illegal mentality has not been thoroughly eliminated in the minds of law students. Using the public to pressure the government and the law.

The "law does not punish the crowd" mentality refers to the inability of judicial organs to punish due to the large number of lawbreakers, and its greatest harm is to encourage people to break the legal system. Unfortunately, this mentality also exists among the law students of China University of Political Science and Law.

When Comrade Hu Yaobang had just passed away, there were only a few big-character posters in China University of Political Science and Law, and the few that appeared were mainly about mourning. Even when posting big and small character posters, it was not done during the day but at night when it was quiet. Later, as more people joined in, the trend of big-character posters changed, and big-character posters were posted regardless of day or night. What gave them courage was not the law, but the traditional saying of "law does not punish the crowd."

At the beginning of the turmoil, when the long-term advocate of bourgeois liberalization, Tan Wenchang, gave a speech at China University of Political Science and Law, the audience basically maintained a silent attitude. Later, when the number of participants in the turmoil increased, even a speech or a trivial slogan could provoke abnormal applause. Here, the role played was still the "strength in numbers" mentality.

Initially, those who participated in the parade were cautious and the number was not large. Later, as Beijing became chaotic and other places also became chaotic, those who participated in the parade no longer had any scruples, and the slogans became more intense, calling for the overthrow of this and that, demanding the retirement of this and that, and the resignation of that. At this time, someone thought: Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people all went to parade, what power would the law have? Would the law be able to deal with all these people? In the face of such great pressure, what choice would the government make? Going to trample on the law with an illegal mentality, pressuring the government, and demanding that the government yield, this is obviously wrong and is an anarchist trend.

We should understand that any system, law, or regulation exists on the premise of being recognized and universally followed by society. Without this premise, the so-called system, law, and regulation would lose their meaning. The laws and regulations of our country are formulated by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, various levels of people's congresses and their standing committees, and the central and local governments at various levels, representing the will of the people. They protect the interests of the state and the people and have been universally recognized by the people. The laws of our country are the laws of our people, and our own laws should be followed by ourselves. Only by following the law can we be protected by the law. The law is serious, and any attempt to mock it is intolerable. Treating the law as a joke and using the public who are not clear about the truth to suppress the law is a manifestation of a lack of legal concepts. To make the legal system perfect and to make the law thoroughly implemented, what we should do is to make the law deeply rooted in people's hearts and to use our knowledge and actions to tell people that no matter what situation arises, for the interests of the state and the people, we have the duty to follow the law.

Fifth, bourgeois liberalization infiltrated the Marxist-Leninist legal front, weakened Marxist-Leninist education and learning, and made people unable to use class analysis to view bourgeois democracy, freedom, and legal system, and blindly accepted them as beneficial things.

As a teacher from China University of Political Science and Law said, in recent years, those who lectured on Marxism-Leninism were, to a certain extent, not welcome, while what was welcomed was bourgeois liberalization. Young students are eager to accept new things, but lack the ability to discern so-called new things.

Western democracy, freedom, and legal system are indeed reasonable and progressive, and they have played a promoting role in the progress of society to a certain extent in a certain historical period. However, they are ultimately serving the bourgeois exploitation system and are a mixture of essence and dross. We must see their class limitations. To completely reject Western democracy, freedom, and legal system is blindly exclusive and self-sealing; to unselectively accept them wholesale is harmful and blindly worshipful. We can learn from some practices of capitalist countries, but we absolutely cannot copy them. Our practices can only be to remove the dross and take the essence. We must draw a clear line between socialist democracy and capitalist democracy, and at the same time, draw a clear line between socialist democracy and extreme democratization and anarchism. A student from China University of Political Science and Law said: "In our learning, we cannot rationally use class analysis to view some things from the West, but blindly worship them indiscriminately. We praise the so-called 'democracy' and 'legal system' that serve bourgeois interests and maintain bourgeois rule as if they were flowers, and seek a paradise in bourgeois freedom, democracy, and legal system. As a result, ignoring the differences in national conditions and social systems, we one-sidedly blame ourselves and hope to copy others' things. This naive and childish wish has led to the evil result of trampling on our own laws to shout others' laws and taking capitalist legal system as the goal of socialist legal system."

Students of China University of Political Science and Law realized that to enhance the ability to discern and resist bourgeois liberalization and not be confused by the banner of "democracy," we must establish a correct democratic consciousness in our minds. We must recognize that the democracy that our people need today can only be socialist democracy, not bourgeois individualistic democracy; it can only be people's democracy under the concentrated leadership of the Communist Party, not anarchistic democracy without the leadership of the Communist Party; it can only be democracy combined with socialist legal system, not lawless "big democracy." Our country is a socialist country under the people's democratic dictatorship, and dictatorship and democracy are dialectically unified. Dictatorship must continue, and democracy must be expanded.

Reflection is a sobering tonic. Those who study the law mocked the sacred law, leaving a heavy assignment for legal education and the whole society. How to get out of the confusing predicament, how to strengthen the weak links in legal education, and make the legal colleges and universities into Marxist-Leninist legal front, has become an urgent problem for legal education.

The lesson is profound. The positive significance of the lesson lies in turning a bad thing into a good thing, and thus becoming mature from it.

　　学法的为什么做了违法事
　　——中国政法大学师生的反思
　　果卒
    作为政法大学生，理应模范地遵纪守法，旗帜鲜明地做社会主义法制的捍卫者，而事实并非如此。开学以来，中国政法大学的同学们在老师的带领下，学习四中全会文件，学习邓小平同志和江泽民同志的重要讲话，了解从学潮、动乱到反革命暴乱的事实真相，冷静地进行了反思。痛定思痛，一些同学深感作为学法律的大学生自己在这场风波的考试中，交了一份不合格的答卷。
    为什么经不起这场政治斗争的考验？为什么学法的却违了法？政法大学的同学们联系实际，深刻挖掘其中的原因。
    一、错误地理解法制精神和我国的宪法精神，割裂权利与义务、民主自由与法制的关系，以违法的方式去捍卫法律的尊严。
    如果说政法大学被卷入学潮和动乱的同学都是在有意地践踏法律，这种说法是有违那些善良同学的善良的初衷的，对被卷入风波的绝大多数同学来说，事实恰恰相反，他们考虑到了法律的尊严，认识到了法制的重要性，是以知法者的姿态去“护法”的。
    政法大学的同学们重复次数最多的口号是：“法大、法大，法比权大，为了护法，断头不怕。”4月22日胡耀邦同志追悼会正在举行的时候，政法大学的同学们打出了那块颇有影响的牌子，上面写着：“中华人民共和国宪法，第三十五条：中华人民共和国公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由。第三十七条：中华人民共和国公民的人身自由不受侵犯。禁止非法拘禁和以其它方法非法剥夺或者限制公民的人身自由。”4月27日游行，政法大学又打出了“誓死捍卫宪法尊严”的条幅。这里我们不能排除极少数别有用心的人从中做手脚的可能性，但对绝大多数扛着牌子、打着条幅、呼喊口号的同学来说，则是出于善良而天真的愿望。
    我们必须看清这样一个事实，政法大学同学们的“护法”是有所指的，具体是针对北京市人大常委会制定的《北京市关于游行示威若干暂行规定》（以下称“十条”）的。政法大学法律系的一个同学说：“我们只直观地看到了‘十条’与宪法文字上的不同，看到‘十条’对宪法第三十五条的附加性规定不是出自全国人民代表大会或常务委员会，就武断地以为‘十条’违宪了，所以就去护法，所以就去游行示威。”同学们不无天真地认为，法律赋予公民的权利就是无约束的权利，法律所规定的自由就是无限制的绝对的自由。他们呼唤民主和法制，却不能理解什么是真正的民主和法制，他们忘记了在大学一年级第一学期就学过的法学基础理论，老师们明白地讲授过权利与义务、自由与法制的关系。公民在享受法律所规定的权利的同时，必须履行法律所规定的义务（这种义务包括遵守国家宪法和法律的义务）。没有不享受权利的义务，同时也不存在不尽义务的权利。公民的自由必须限制在法律所规定的范围内，没有超越法律之上的、绝对的、无限的自由。自由绝不等于任性，它总是以遵守一定的法律为前提，所以，世界上所有关于公民权利和自由的条款，都对自由规定了附加条件。我们的民主是社会主义的民主，它必须通过法制的轨道来实现。毫无限制，为所欲为，是极端民主化和无政府主义，它带给我们的必然结果是造成社会秩序的混乱，人们渴望的民主制度也无法实现。对这样一些基本的法理知识和法律精神浅尝辄止，不求甚解，或者忽视或忘记，导致了对宪法和法律的片面理解，呈现出践踏法律的有害倾向。有人说宪法不是规定了公民有集会、游行、示威的自由吗？那么为什么不去自由地行使这个权利呢？在这种对法律的片面而肤浅的理解面前，一切义务观念变得苍白无力了。什么约束，什么限制，什么解释，什么秩序，什么安定，都荡然无存了。更令人痛心的是，这种对宪法的践踏竟是在充满激情的维护宪法尊严的情绪支配下去做的。同学们学法违法而不自知，头上高扬的竟是护法的旗帜。在如此情绪支配下，不再有深刻冷静的自省，责己宽，责人严，对政府百般挑剔，刻薄以求。同学们简单地认为，对宪法所规定的自由的任何限制和约束都是与宪法相抵触的，所以‘十条’是违宪的。他们忘记了，我国宪法在总纲中规定了第35条和第37条的同时，在分则中还规定了第100条：“省、直辖市的人民代表大会和它们的常务委员会，在不同宪法、法律、行政法规相抵触的前提下，可以制定地方性法规，报全国人民代表大会常务委员会备案。”地方性法规在本地区与国家的各种法律一样，是具有法律效力的。“十条”是对我国宪法第35条的附加性规定，是具有法律效力的地方性法规。因为同学们没能很好地领会宪法的精神实质，没能扎扎实实地去掌握法学基础理论，对宪法，重总纲轻分则，结果一叶障目，不见泰山，以知法者自居，行了不懂法之实，在护法的旗帜下，做了与自己愿望不相符的践踏法制、违反法律的事。
    二、缺少学法者的责任意识，只片面地为自己的行为寻找法律依据，钻法律空子，讳言对个人行为的限制性法律规定。
    政法大学的一些同学说，我们学法而不知如何去维护法律的尊严，更忘记了模范地遵纪守法是党和人民以及所学专业赋予我们的神圣职责。相反的是，在正应该带头守法的时候，我们却自以为聪明，钻法律的空子。
    同学们说，我们只看到人们呼喊“打倒官倒”，“铲除腐败”等积极善良的一面，就受感动于大家的爱国热情，于是就孤立地打出那个写有宪法第35条和第37条的牌子，为非法集会、游行、示威寻找法律依据，幼稚地为那些非法行为正名。而对那些对个人行为的限制性法律规定却讳莫如深。比如宪法第51条，那上面规定：“中华人民共和国公民在行使自由和权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其它公民的合法的自由和权利。”4月22日胡耀邦同志追悼大会举行时天安门广场上演的闹剧，险些使追悼会不能正常进行。这种集会即使没有北京市的“十条”规定，即使没有天安门广场管理处关于在广场集会的特殊规定，就是在我们国家的根本大法上也能找出它的违法性根据来。那种非法集会已经严重地影响了我们国家和社会的利益，是为宪法所不容的。5月13日开始的所谓“绝食”及以后的声援游行，使戈尔巴乔夫访华的重大仪式不能按计划正常进行。如此重大的使全球为之瞩目的国事活动都受到了干扰破坏，这能说不违反宪法吗？再比如5月17日以后，政法大学部分师生长期占据新华门，已经严重地影响了党和国家领导人及国家工作人员正常地行使公务，损害了我们国家的声誉，这又怎能说不违法呢？同学们呼唤法制，总是责怪我们国家法制不健全，但当法律没有空子可钻的时候，他们却很笨拙地生造出空子来钻。同学们自身的法制观念又是多么淡薄啊！
    第五届全国人大第三次会议在1980年9月10日作出决议，取消了原宪法第45条关于公民“有运用‘大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报’的权利”的规定。《北京日报》也曾发表文章：“大字报不受法律保护”。但在前几年，政法大学校园内就曾贴出过署名为“宪法爱好者”的大字报，笔者咬文嚼字地说：宪法取消了“四大”，但翻遍全部宪法条款，也没发现禁止“四大”的规定，没有禁止的条款说明大字报是不违宪的，只是不受法律保护而已。后期出现的另一张大字报上又说，宪法不保护写大字报者的权利，但也没规定保护撕大字报者的权利。他们不了解，宪法既然不保护大字报，人们就有权制止大字报。大字报、小字报是“文革”的遗风，十年动乱证明，大、小字报是不负责任地进行人身攻击，造谣中伤，制造冤、假、错案的工具，它曾使许多人身受其害。如果不是对文革危害认识不足或对文革存有恋情，大、小字报是不会使人产生好感的。我国刑法第一百四十五条规定，不得“用‘大字报’，‘小字报’，公然侮辱他人或者捏造事实诽谤他人”。这次风波中出现的大、小字报，绝大多数是以侮辱、诽谤党和国家领导人为内容的，同时它也是传播谣言的主要媒介。有些人寻找借口说：目前我国的民主渠道不畅通，需要有大、小字报来补充。我们承认，我国的政治体制还不完善，民主制度还不健全，但是，我们党已经做出各种努力，通过同各阶层对话、举报、来信来访等形式了解下情，沟通情况。我们所应做的努力应该是通过合法渠道去反映问题，逐步使法律制度臻于完备，而不能采取违法、钻空子的办法来破坏社会的安定。
    三、强烈的风头意识，冲淡了脆弱的法制观念，注重虚荣，忘却了党的、国家的和集体的利益。
    在前几年出现的学潮中，政法大学都在校党委、老师和同学们的共同努力下，稳住了阵脚，没有介入。一些带有糊涂认识的同学不但不以为荣，反而认为这是缺少所谓“参与意识”的耻辱。有的同学甚至产生我不如人的自卑感。受这种意识的左右，政法大学部分同学在这场风波中冥思苦想，花样翻新，出尽风头。
    4月17日下午，政法大学部分师生第一个组织队伍去天安门广场，在这场风波中开了违法游行的先河。有的同学游行归来后，自豪于“敢为天下先”的光采。他们也明白，未经公安机关批准登记的游行是违法的，是有风险的举动。但是不正常的情绪左右着他们，“为民请命”的幌子激励着他们，他们不再顾及什么法律了，只要能充分显示其强烈的“参与意识”，法律也可以变成一纸空文。个别师生在几个非法组织中担任了职务，“高自联”在政法大学召开了中外记者招待会，严重地影响了政法大学的声誉，但有些糊涂的同学却不加分析地认为这扬了政法大学的名声；部分人到新华门前去绝食、绝水，损害了我们国家的形象和利益，而那些认识不清的人却认为这是有爱国心的正义之举。同学们常常抱怨别人的法制观念淡薄，对有法不依的现象深恶痛绝。但是，50多天的实际表明，这种弊病就存在于同学们自己身上。不懂法而违法是盲目无知的行为，而知法却以身试法则是清醒的无知和疯狂。
    几年来，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，不计社会效果的“崇尚自我”、“自我实现”等，无疑对这种风头意识的形成起了至关重要的作用。同学们通过学习认识到，出如此风头带给政法大学的不是无尚光荣，而是奇耻大辱，它严重地败坏了政法大学的声誉，损害了国家和人民的利益。
    四、传统的“法不责众”的无法心理，没有在学法者的意识中被彻底荡涤。以公众压政府、压法律。
    “法不责众”观念是指由于违法的人数众多而导致司法机关无法制裁，它的最大危害是纵恿人们去破坏法制，在我国有较大的市场。令人遗憾的是，这种观念在学法的政法大学的同学中也有表现。
    在胡耀邦同志刚刚逝世的时候，政法大学的大字报还寥寥无几，出现的几张也都以悼念为主题，去贴大小字报也不在白天，而在夜深人静的时候。后来闹的人多了，大字报的风头也就转了，贴大字报也不管白天与黑夜了。壮胆子的不是法律，而是“法不责众”的传统信条。
    学潮之初，当长期坚持资产阶级自由化的反动分子任畹町到政法大学演讲的时候，听的人基本上保持了沉默的态度。后来，当参加学潮、卷入动乱的人多起来了的时候，一个演讲甚至一句很无聊的口号，都能引起不正常的掌声。这里起作用的依然是“人多势众”的意识。
    最初游行，参加者小心谨慎，而且数量也不多。后来，北京乱了，外地也开始乱了，参加游行的人也就不再有所顾忌了，口号也变得激烈起来，打倒这个，打倒那个，要这个退休，要那个辞职。这时，有人想：几万人，几十万人都去游行，法律还会有什么力量？对这些人都依法予以处置吗？在强大的压力面前，政府又会做出如何选择呢？带着无法心理去践踏法律，压政府，要求政府就范，这显然是错误的，是无政府主义的思潮。
    我们应该懂得，任何一种制度、法律、规定存在的前提条件是：得到社会的认可和普遍遵守。失去了这个前提条件，所谓制度、法律和规定也就失去了意义。我国的法律、法规是由代表人民意志的全国人民代表大会及其常务委员会，各级人民代表大会及其常务委员会，以及中央、地方各级政府制定的，它们所保护的是国家和人民的利益，都得到了人民群众的普遍认可。我国的法律是我国人民自己的法律，自己的法律应该由自己去遵守，遵守法律也才能得到法律的保护。法律是严肃的，任何嘲弄它的企图都是为它所不容的。视法律为儿戏，以不明真相的公众压制法律的行为，是缺少法制观念的表现。要让法制得到健全，要让法律得到彻底地贯彻执行，我们应该做的是让法律深入人心，是以自己的知识和行动去告诉人们，无论什么情况发生，为了国家和人民的利益，我们都有义务去遵守法律。
    五、资产阶级自由化侵袭马列主义法学阵地，弱化了马列主义教育和学习，使人不能用阶级分析的观点去对待资产阶级的民主、自由、法制，竟当作有益的东西盲目接受。
    正如政法大学的一位教师所说，几年来讲马列的，在一定程度上不受欢迎，而受欢迎的则是资产阶级自由化的东西。青年学生乐于接受新事物，但对所谓的新事物缺少甄别能力。
    西方的民主、自由、法制固然有其合理性和进步意义，它们在一定的历史阶段和一定程度上对社会的进步起过推动作用。但它们毕竟是为资产阶级剥削制度服务的，是精华与糟粕共存的，我们必须看到它们的阶级局限性。对西方的民主、自由、法制一概采取拒斥的态度，是盲目排外的自我封闭；不加选择地全盘接受，则是不顾国情的有害的崇外行为。我们可以借鉴资本主义国家的某些做法，但绝对不能照搬。我们的做法只能是去其糟粕，取其精华。我们必须划清社会主义民主与资本主义民主的界限，同时还要划清社会主义民主与极端民主化、无政府主义的界限。政法大学的一位同学说：“在学习中，我们不能理性地用阶级分析的观点对待西方的一些东西，而是不辨皂白地去盲目崇拜。把为资产阶级利益服务、维护资产阶级统治的所谓‘民主’、‘法制’说得天花乱坠，在资产阶级的自由、民主、法制中寻找天堂。结果，不顾国情和社会制度的不同，片面地去责难我们自己，并希冀照搬人家的东西。这种天真幼稚的愿望所铸成的恶劣结果是：不惜践踏自己的法律，去呼喊人家的法律，把资本主义的法制当成社会主义法制的目标。”
    政法大学师生认识到，为了增强识别和抵制资产阶级自由化的能力，不被“要民主”的旗号所迷惑，头脑里要树立起正确的民主意识。认清我国人民今天需要的民主只能是社会主义的民主，而不是资产阶级的个人主义的民主；只能是共产党集中领导下的人民民主，而不是摆脱共产党领导的无政府的民主；只能是与社会主义法制结合起来的民主、而不是无法无天的“大民主”。我国是人民民主专政的社会主义国家，专政与民主是辩证统一的，专政要继续，民主要扩大。
    反思是一副清醒剂。学法的嘲弄了神圣的法律，这给法学教育及全社会都留下了一个沉重的课题。如何走出令人迷惑的困境，如何强化法学教育中的薄弱环节，把政法院校办成马列主义的法学阵地，成为法学教育急待解决的问题。
    教训是深刻的。教训的积极意义在于坏事变成好事，由此变得成熟起来。
