The 1989 National Table Tennis Championship began today and will continue until the 17th at the Shijingshan Sports Hall in Beijing. A total of 30 men's teams and 29 women's teams, with over 300 athletes, are participating in this large-scale event.

The team competition will be conducted in two stages. The first stage will feature a round-robin format, and the second stage will see teams grouped by their rankings from the first stage to compete in a knockout format. All five individual events will also use a knockout system. To provide more athletes with training opportunities, consolation matches will be held for singles players eliminated in the first two rounds.

Beijing has not hosted the National Table Tennis Championship for many years. The organizing committee hopes that everyone will show interest in the "national sport," watch more matches, and give the athletes more encouragement.
