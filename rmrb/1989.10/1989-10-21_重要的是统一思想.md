At present, all Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels of the Party and government, are earnestly studying Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech on National Day. Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech, representing the Party Central Committee and the State Council, is not a mere holiday address but a political declaration of the third-generation leadership collective of China. It is a program of action for guiding the entire Party and the people of the whole country in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It provides an extremely profound exposition of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important speeches this spring and summer, and is an excellent Marxist document. The entire Party should study this speech repeatedly, deeply understand it, and resolutely implement it.

In June of this year, shortly after the decisive victory in suppressing the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, our Party convened the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The plenary session focused on solving the most urgent task at the time of rebuilding the Party Central Committee's leadership core and addressing the question of whether the Party's major policies would change. The plenary session successfully completed its predetermined tasks. Three months later, Comrade Jiang Zemin's National Day speech, concentrating the collective wisdom of Party members both inside and outside the Party, scientifically summarized the experiences of the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, the 10 years of reform and opening up, and the lessons from the two months of turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion from a new historical height. It drew four basic conclusions and clarified 10 important issues. The speech is highly theoretical, yet also highly directive and practical, serving as an exemplary model of "calmly reflecting on the past and considering the future." Studying Comrade Jiang Zemin's National Day speech will greatly elevate our understanding based on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, broadening our horizons, clarifying our direction, and strengthening our resolve.

The key to studying the speech is to ensure that one's thoughts and understanding genuinely align with the basic conclusions and important points in the speech. If this is not achieved, and instead one merely goes through the motions, engages in idle chatter, or indulges in impractical boasting, the study will be superficial and fail to achieve the intended goals. In this regard, we have learned a profound lesson over the past decade. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party has formulated and adopted many good documents and reports. Some comrades have studied and supported them, but they have not truly aligned their thoughts and understanding with the spirit of these documents and reports. The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee in 1981 is a good document. It clearly states: "The four cardinal principles are the common political foundation for the unity of the whole Party and all ethnic groups in the country, and are also the fundamental guarantee for the smooth progress of the cause of socialist modernization. Any speech or action deviating from the four cardinal principles is wrong, and any speech or action that denies and undermines the four cardinal principles is unacceptable." However, some comrades' understanding did not truly align with the spirit of this resolution. The "Resolution on the Guideline for Building Socialist Spiritual Civilization" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee in 1986 is also a good document. It clearly states: "Promoting bourgeois liberalization, which means denying the socialist system and advocating the capitalist system, is fundamentally against the interests of the people and the historical trend, and is firmly opposed by the broad masses of the people." Some comrades' understanding did not truly align with the spirit of this resolution. Similarly, for the "one center, two basic points" proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress, especially the basic point of adhering to the four cardinal principles, there were similar situations. This is an important reason why some comrades were influenced by bourgeois liberalization thought, wavered in their stance during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, and made mistakes. This negative lesson must be deeply remembered.

In recent years, some comrades have been reluctant to emphasize the unity of thought and understanding. They often cite the Party Constitution, stating that it stipulates: "If one has different opinions on the Party's resolutions and policies, one can reserve one's opinion while firmly implementing them, and can also present one's opinions to the higher Party organizations up to the Central Committee." This is indeed correct. However, they forget that the Party Constitution also clearly stipulates that the Party must resolutely achieve high unity in ideology and politics; it clearly stipulates that adhering to the four cardinal principles is the political foundation for the unity of the whole Party. On these major principle issues and issues of right and wrong, if one does not genuinely resolve them ideologically, overcome incorrect views that contradict the Party's resolutions, and establish views that are highly consistent with the Party's resolutions, then it is unreliable to expect consistency in action with the Party. Once the situation changes, ideological inconsistency can lead to political inconsistency. Did not the errors made by some Party members during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion prove this point? As a Party organization, one should allow Party members the right to reserve their opinions and genuinely protect this right of Party members; while as a conscious communist who has joined the organization, one should consciously demand of oneself to maintain high consistency with the Party Central Committee on major political principles, aligning one's thoughts and understanding with the Party's line, principles, and policies. If one emphasizes reserving opinions that are inconsistent with the Party on major political principles, it is difficult to say that one is a qualified communist.

The four basic conclusions and 10 important issues expounded in Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech are all major issues, principle issues, and issues that require unified understanding. They are conclusions drawn from the application of the dialectical and historical materialist viewpoints and methods, materialistically, dialectically, and comprehensively analyzing history and reality, and summarizing the positive and negative experiences. The speech elucidates the good policies and experiences that we have consistently adhered to over the past decade and will continue to adhere to in the future, such as "one center, two basic points," rectification and deepening of reform, combining planned economy with market regulation, "respecting knowledge and respecting talent," and the construction of democracy and the legal system. The speech also points out the aspects that we have neglected or weakened in recent years, such as the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, wholeheartedly relying on the working class, Party building, and ideological and political work. The speech also refutes the erroneous views of bourgeois liberalization, such as economic "privatization," political "pluralism," and creating a so-called "middle class." We, the broad masses of Party members and cadres, are participants in the various undertakings of our country over the past decade, not outsiders. Have we genuinely adhered to what should be firmly adhered to in thought and work? Have we neglected or weakened what should not be neglected or weakened? Have we resolutely resisted and criticized what should be resolutely resisted and criticized? Each comrade should, during the study of the speech, carefully link it with one's own ideological and practical work, conduct a thorough self-examination, identify gaps, understand dangers, find root causes, and through such meticulous and arduous efforts, genuinely align one's understanding on a series of major issues with the spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech.

In this study, leading cadres at all levels should set an example by taking the lead. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in the speech: "It is necessary to resolutely correct the situation where many leading cadres are bogged down in routine matters, neglect theoretical study, and do not pay attention to ideological and political dynamics, and to genuinely improve the theoretical level and political acumen of all Party members." Leading cadres at all levels should take this study as a turning point and strive to improve the Marxist theoretical level of the entire Party. Our cause is glorious, our tasks are arduous, and our responsibilities are great. Material can turn into spirit, and spirit can turn into material. Once theory is grasped by the masses, it can become a great material force. The improvement of the Party's theoretical level will surely push the cause of socialist reform and socialist construction to new heights.

　　重要的是统一思想
    当前，全党同志、特别是各级党政领导干部正在认真学习江泽民同志的国庆讲话。江泽民同志代表党中央、国务院发表的这个重要讲话，不是一般的节日讲话，而是中国第三代领导集体的政治宣言，是指导全党和全国人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的行动纲领。它对邓小平同志今年春夏之间一系列重要讲话，作了极其深刻的阐述，是一个很好的马克思主义的文件。对于这个讲话，全党应当反复学习，深刻领会，坚决贯彻执行。
    今年6月，在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利后不久，我们党召开了十三届四中全会。全会着重解决了当时最急迫的重建党中央领导核心的问题，着重回答了当时人们最关心的党的大政方针是否会改变的问题。全会胜利完成了预定的任务。过了3个月后，江泽民同志发表的国庆讲话，集中党内外同志的集体智慧，从新的历史高度对建国40年的经验、改革开放10年的经验，以及两个月的动乱和反革命暴乱的教训作了科学的总结，得出4个基本结论，阐明10个重要问题。讲话有很强的理论性，又有很强的指导性、实践性，是“冷静地考虑一下过去，也考虑一下未来”的典范。认真学习江泽民同志的国庆讲话，将使我们的思想在学习十三届四中全会精神的基础上大大提高一步，眼界更加开阔，方向更加明确，信心更加坚定。
    学习讲话，最重要的是使自己的思想认识真正统一到讲话的基本结论和重要观点上来。如果不是这样，而是满足于一般的表态、漫谈，或是不切实际地夸夸其谈，学习就会走过场，不能达到预期的目的。在这方面，近10年来我们是有深刻教训的。党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党制定、通过了不少好文件、好报告，一些同志也学了，也拥护，但是没有真正使自己的思想认识完全统一到文件、报告的精神上来。1981年党的十一届六中全会通过的《关于建国以来党的若干历史问题的决议》是一个好文件，其中明确指出：“四项基本原则，是全党团结和全国各族人民团结的共同的政治基础，也是社会主义现代化建设事业顺利进行的根本保证。一切偏离四项基本原则的言论和行动都是错误的，一切否定和破坏四项基本原则的言论和行动都是不能容许的。”可是有些同志的认识并没有真正统一到《决议》的精神上来。1986年党的十二届六中全会通过的《关于社会主义精神文明建设指导方针的决议》也是一个好文件，其中明确指出：“搞资产阶级自由化，即否定社会主义制度、主张资本主义制度，是根本违背人民利益和历史潮流，为广大人民所坚决反对的。”有些同志的认识也没有真正统一到这个《决议》的精神上来。对于党的十三大提出的“一个中心、两个基本点”，特别是坚持四项基本原则这个基本点，也有类似的情形。这就是某些同志之所以接受资产阶级自由化思想的影响，在动乱和反革命暴乱中立场不稳，犯了错误的重要原因。这个反面的教训，值得牢牢记取。
    近几年来，有些同志不大赞成提统一思想、统一认识。他们常常以党章为根据，说党章规定：“对党的决议和政策如有不同意见，在坚决执行的前提下，可以声明保留，并且可以把自己的意见向党的上级组织直至中央提出。”这诚然是不错的。但是他们忘记了党章还明确规定，党必须坚决实现思想上政治上的高度一致；明确规定，坚持四项基本原则是全党团结统一的政治基础。在这些重大的原则问题上，在大是大非问题上，如果不是真正从思想上解决问题，克服与党的决议相悖的不正确的观点，树立与党的决议高度一致的观点，那么希求在行动上始终与党保持一致是靠不住的，一旦气候适宜，风云变幻，思想上的不一致就可能导致政治上的不一致。动乱、反革命暴乱期间，某些党员同志犯了错误，不就证明了这一点吗？作为党的组织，应当允许党员有保留自己意见的权利，并切实保护党员的这种权利；而作为一名加入组织的有高度觉悟的共产党员，则应当自觉地要求自己在重大的政治原则问题上必须同党中央保持高度一致，使自己的思想认识统一到党的路线、方针、政策上来。如果在重大政治原则问题上也强调保留自己与党不一致的观点，那就很难说是一个合格的共产党员。
    江泽民同志讲话中所阐明的4个基本结论和10个重要问题，都是重大的问题、原则的问题、必须统一认识的问题，是运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点和方法，唯物地、辩证地、全面地剖析历史和现实，总结正反两方面的经验得出的令人信服的结论。讲话阐明了10年来我们一直坚持的、今后仍然要继续坚持下去的好政策、好经验，例如：“一个中心、两个基本点”，治理整顿、深化改革，计划经济与市场调节相结合，“尊重知识、尊重人才”，民主和法制建设等；讲话又指出了近年来我们忽视或削弱了的方面，例如：社会主义精神文明建设，全心全意依靠工人阶级，党的建设，思想政治工作等；讲话还批驳了资产阶级自由化的错误观点，例如：什么经济“私有化”，政治“多元化”，制造一个所谓“中产阶级”等。我们广大党员和党员干部是我国10年来各项事业的参加者，不是局外人。应当在思想上、工作中很好地坚持的，是否坚持了？不应当忽视或削弱的，是否忽视或削弱了？应当坚决抵制和批判的，是否抵制和批判了？每个同志在学习讲话的时候，都应当很好地联系自己的思想实际、工作实际，仔细地对照检查一番，找差距，明危害，查根源，通过下这样一番细功夫、苦功夫，使自己在一系列重大问题的认识上真正统一到江泽民同志讲话的精神上来。
    在这次学习中，各级领导干部要以身作则，做学习的模范。江泽民同志在讲话中提出：“必须坚决纠正许多领导干部陷入日常事务、放松理论学习、不注意思想政治动态的状况，切切实实地提高全党同志的理论水平和政治敏锐性。”各级领导干部应当以这次学习为转折点，为提高全党的马克思主义理论水平而努力。我们的事业是光荣的，我们的任务是艰巨的，我们的责任是重大的。物质可以变成精神，精神又可以变成物质，理论一旦被群众所掌握，就可以变成巨大的物质力量。全党理论水平的提高，必将把社会主义改革和社会主义建设事业推向新的高度。
