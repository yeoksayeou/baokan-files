Premier Li Peng held talks with President Yasser Arafat of the State of Palestine this morning in the Great Hall of the People.

During the talks, Premier Li Peng solemnly declared that, to promote the Middle East peace process, the Chinese government formally proposes the following five points: (1) The Middle East issue should be resolved through political means, and all parties should refrain from using force. (2) Support the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and the relevant parties. (3) Support the Middle East parties in conducting dialogues in various forms they deem appropriate, including direct talks between the PLO and Israel. (4) Israel must stop its suppression of Palestinian residents in the occupied territories and withdraw from the occupied Arab lands, while ensuring Israel's security in return. (5) The State of Palestine and the State of Israel should recognize each other, and the Arab and Jewish peoples should live in peace.

Arafat first reviewed the friendly relations between Palestine and China. He said, whether from the perspective of the two countries or from our personal relationships, we are old friends. Whenever we encounter difficulties, we say we can turn to our Chinese friends. We are indeed "friends in times of trouble."

Arafat detailed the current situation in the Middle East, the main struggles of the Palestinian people, and the active efforts made by the PLO to seek a political solution to the Middle East issue. He emphasized that although the Palestinian people face many difficulties, we are united internally, our people's fighting spirit is high, and the international situation is favorable to us. We are determined to carry on the just struggle of the Palestinian people to the end.

Premier Li Peng said that the Chinese government's position on the Palestinian people's struggle is clear: we have always opposed Israel's policy of aggression and expansion, and support the Arab and Palestinian peoples' just struggle to reclaim their lost lands and restore their national rights. He said that the struggle of the Palestinian people is gaining more and more sympathy and support from people around the world.

Li Peng believes that the 10-point peace plan recently proposed by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has positive significance, and hopes that the relevant parties will make new efforts through dialogue to promote the Middle East peace process. He also expressed great concern over the situation in Lebanon.

After the talks, Premier Li Peng hosted a luncheon for the distinguished guests from the State of Palestine.

This morning, President Arafat, accompanied by the head of the delegation and Minister of Aerospace Industry Lin Zongtang, laid a wreath at the Monument to the People's Heroes.

　  我国政府对中东问题提出五点主张
    本报北京10月5日讯　记者温宪报道：李鹏总理今天上午在人民大会堂同巴勒斯坦国总统阿拉法特举行了会谈。
    会谈中，李鹏总理郑重声明，为了推动中东和平进程，中国政府正式提出如下五点主张：（一）中东问题应通过政治途径解决，各方都不诉诸武力。（二）支持召开联合国主持下，有五个常任理事国和有关各方参加的中东国际和平会议。（三）支持中东有关各方进行他们认为合适的、各种形式的对话，包括巴解组织和以色列直接对话。（四）以色列必须停止在占领区对巴勒斯坦居民镇压，撤出占领的阿拉伯领土，相应地以色列的安全也应得到保证。（五）巴勒斯坦国和以色列国相互承认，阿拉伯民族和犹太民族和平共处。
    阿拉法特在会谈中首先回顾了巴、中之间的友好关系。他说，无论从巴、中两国，还是从我们个人之间的关系来说，我们都是老朋友。每当我们遇到困难，总是说可以去找中国老朋友。我们确实是“患难之中的真交”。
    阿拉法特详细介绍了当前的中东形势、巴勒斯坦人民斗争的主要情况和巴解组织为寻求中东问题的政治解决所做出的积极努力。他强调说，巴勒斯坦人民虽然面临许多困难，但我们内部是团结的，人民斗志是高昂的，国际形势对我们是有利的。我们决心将巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争进行到底。
    李鹏总理说，中国政府对巴勒斯坦人民斗争的立场是清楚的。这就是：我们一直反对以色列的侵略扩张政策，支持阿拉伯和巴勒斯坦人民要求收复失地、恢复民族权利的正义斗争。他说，巴勒斯坦人民的斗争正在获得全世界越来越多人民的同情和支持。
    李鹏认为，埃及总统穆巴拉克最近提出的10点和平计划有积极意义，希望有关各方通过对话为推动中东和平进程做出新的努力。他还对黎巴嫩局势表示十分关切。
    会谈后，李鹏总理设午宴款待巴勒斯坦国贵宾。
    今天上午，阿拉法特总统在陪同团团长、航空航天工业部部长林宗棠陪同下，向人民英雄纪念碑敬献了花圈。
