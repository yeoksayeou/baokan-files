The Belgrade Radio Station in the capital of Yugoslavia has initiated a campaign encouraging every car owner to plant a tree to offset the pollution caused by automobiles to the human environment.

According to a report by the *Politika* newspaper on September 21, the Belgrade Radio Station stated in its appeal that automobiles are one of the major pollutants of the human environment. Therefore, car owners should spend 100,000 dinars (approximately three U.S. dollars) to purchase a sapling and be responsible for planting it when they register their vehicle. In this way, within a few years, Belgrade will have an additional 500,000 trees.

The initiative by the Belgrade Radio Station has received active support from the city's Green Committee and the Environmental Protection Bureau.

Belgrade has a population of 1.5 million people and approximately 400,000 motor vehicles. Traffic congestion is severe, and air pollution is also very serious.

    将功补过　车主植树
    南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德广播电台倡议，每辆汽车的主人种植一棵树，以弥补汽车对人类环境造成的污染。
    据《政治报》九月二十一日报道，贝尔格莱德广播电台在倡议书中说，汽车是人类环境的最大污染者之一。因此，汽车的主人在办理汽车牌照登记时，应花十万第纳尔（约合三美元）购买一株树苗并负责栽种。这样，用不了几年，贝尔格莱德将增加五十万株树木。
    贝尔格莱德广播电台的这一倡议得到了市绿化委员会和市环境保护局的积极支持。
    贝尔格莱德拥有一百五十万人口，约有四十多万辆机动车辆，市内交通十分拥护，空气污染也很严重。
