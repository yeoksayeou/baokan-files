Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, October 24th.

The fourth round of the 1990 World Cup Asian qualifying matches took place tonight at the Singapore National Stadium. China won 1-0 against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, while Qatar drew 1-1 with the United Arab Emirates.

Tonight's match was played on a wet, slippery field after the rain. The West Asian teams from Qatar and the UAE started the competition. In the 20th minute of the first half, UAE's number 2 defender Mubarak easily scored a goal. Eighteen minutes later, Qatar's number 3, Ali Sulayti, headed the ball into the net, equalizing the score. Before the end of the first half, Qatar was awarded a penalty kick, but unfortunately, the shot went high, missing a chance to win. The draw result means the UAE has 1 win and 3 draws in 4 matches, accumulating 5 points, making their qualification prospects relatively optimistic. Qatar currently has 3 draws and 1 loss in 4 matches, accumulating 3 points.

The China-North Korea match saw both teams evenly matched. From the kickoff, both teams engaged in a full-scale offensive battle. In the first half, China's team, due to playing quickly and encountering fierce pressure from the opposing team, had less coordinated attacks and more passing errors. Eight minutes before the end of the match, China passed the ball from the left forward area to the right, where number 7 Xie Yuxin received the ball and shot it forward. The ball flew straight into the net from under the opponent's goalkeeper's arm. This goal gave China, which was on the brink of elimination, 2 wins and 2 losses in 4 matches, accumulating 4 points, still with a chance to qualify. North Korea has 1 win, 1 draw, and 2 losses in 4 matches, accumulating 3 points. Tomorrow will be the final match of the fourth round, with Saudi Arabia facing South Korea.

　　中国足球队胜朝鲜队
　　进军罗马尚有一线希望
    据新华社新加坡10月24日电　（记者张千里、李永明）1990年世界杯足球赛亚洲区预选赛决赛第四轮比赛今晚在新加坡国家体育场进行，中国队以1∶0力克朝鲜民主主义人民共和国队，卡塔尔队1∶1逼和阿拉伯联合酋长国队。
    今晚的比赛是在雨后湿滑的场地上进行的。西亚的卡塔尔和阿联酋队首先交锋。在上半时第20分钟时，阿队2号后卫穆巴拉克轻松将球射入门内。18分钟后，卡队3号阿里·苏莱提顶球入网，将比分扳平。上半时结束前，卡队获罚点球机会，可惜将球踢高，丧失取胜良机。两队战平的结果使阿联酋队4战1胜3平积5分，出线前景较乐观；卡塔尔队目前4战3平1负积3分。
    中、朝之战，双方势均力敌。从开球便开始整体对攻战。上半时中国队由于打得快，又遇对方逼抢凶猛，进攻配合不够默契，传球失误较多。终场前8分钟时，中国队从左前场将球长传转移右路，7号谢育新接球后向前一拨，起脚便射，球从对方守门员手臂下面直飞网内。这一进球使处于被淘汰边缘的中国队4战2胜2负积4分，尚有出线希望，朝鲜队4战1胜1平2负积3分。明天将进行第四轮的最后一场比赛，由沙特阿拉伯队与南朝鲜队交锋。（附图片）
