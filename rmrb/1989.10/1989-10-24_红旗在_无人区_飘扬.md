Everyone has their cherished possessions. I have always treasured a map of China's topography. This is not an ordinary map; it is one that I personally drew over ten years. The different shades and uneven contour lines on it record the mountains and rivers of the republic that I surveyed as a mapping soldier. In the area where Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang meet, there is a vivid five-star red flag. This unforgettable mark records my and my comrades' extraordinary experience of being stranded in the "Qinghai-Tibet No-Man's Land" for seven days and seven nights.

In October 1980, I and 28 mapping soldiers were tasked with surveying the "No-Man's Land." I served as the leader. This "No-Man's Land" has an average elevation of over 4,500 meters, is cold and oxygen-deprived, has towering ice peaks, unpredictable weather, difficult transportation, and is rarely visited by people. It was once known as the "Forbidden Zone of Life." Just as we had completed our survey mission here and were about to withdraw, five vehicles got stuck in an ice river at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains' main peak, Muz Tagh. During the day, the melting snow from the Kunlun Mountains rolled in waves; at night, temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius froze the vehicles and snow together. The only vehicle that could self-rescue, the winch car, was also stuck in the ice and snow and couldn't move.

For thousands of miles around, there was no sign of human activity, and we couldn't contact the outside world. The season of heavy snowfall was approaching, our food and fuel were running low, and the soldiers, whose faces were cracked from the cold and bodies swollen, felt death approaching step by step... During the day, we struggled to move stones from the base of the mountain; at night, we broke the ice and jumped into waist-deep water to build a dam and shovel stones under the winch car's wheels. The sharp ice blocks cut through our skin like knives; the cold snow water pierced our bones like needles. The pain was almost unbearable. If rescuing the car was just for survival, I would almost have preferred to lie down and stay forever with the majestic Kunlun Mountains rather than endure this suffering. But for the sake of eliminating a blank area on the map of the republic and not disappointing the party and the people's trust, we encouraged each other to grit our teeth and persevere to the end, carrying our data out of the no-man's land.

One day, two days... Six days and nights passed. Although my comrades racked their brains and exerted all their strength, the winch car remained stuck in the ice river like a rooted tree, unmoving.

"Platoon Leader, I think we can't get out of the 'No-Man's Land' anymore," said 17-year-old Niu Zhili, tears streaming down his face.

"Little Niu, don't lose heart. We are fighting in the embrace of our motherland. Even if the car can't be rescued, the party and the people will spare no effort to rescue us."

"Platoon Leader, while we still have the strength, let's seal the data and results in a safe place, and write a detailed report to the party committee. If we can't get out, the comrades who come to find us in the future will be able to find the data and information..."

Listening to everyone's discussions, I couldn't help but shed tears.

After properly handling the data and results and carefully planning the food and fuel, we made a vivid five-star red flag using our surveying cloth and let it rise on the riverbank. We lined up under the red flag and took an oath: Dear motherland, for your prosperity and strength, we will struggle tirelessly while alive, and if we die, we will rest in peace under the majestic Kunlun Mountains... As long as the red flag is there, our data is there, and the soldiers' loyalty is there!

We decided to make a desperate effort—we pulled out all the tent poles and buried them in the ground to tow the winch car. Although we were already exhausted, the fluttering red flag awakened our last bit of strength. From the morning of October 30th, under heavy snowfall, my comrades dug holes in the frozen layer like iron plates, and after more than 10 hours of effort, they finally carved out a two-meter-long, waist-deep trench in the riverbank that had been frozen for thousands of years. We tied more than 20 tent poles together and hung them on the steel cable of the winch car, then poured water, filled it with stones, and sealed it with soil, letting it freeze tightly with the ice mountains and snow peaks. The next early morning, my comrades swung their iron picks like madmen, breaking the solid ice around the winch car. More than 20 people shouldered and pushed, and in a chorus that shook the mountains, the winch car slowly emerged from the water. Finally, we towed the vehicles out of the ice river one by one.

"We have won! We have won!"

The comrades' voices echoed in the "No-Man's Land."

Since then, every time I see the fluttering five-star red flag, I think of the seven days and nights in the ice and snow of the "Qinghai-Tibet No-Man's Land"...

### 红旗在“无人区”飘扬

　　红旗在“无人区”飘扬
　　河南郑州市民政局　刘国运
    每个人都有自己的心爱之物。我一直珍藏着一幅中国地形图。这不是普通的地图，而是我在十几年间一点一点亲手绘制的。图上深浅不同的色块和一条条粗细不匀的等高线，记载着我在当测绘兵的日子里踏勘过的共和国山山水水。就在西藏、青海、新疆三省区交汇处，画着一面鲜艳的五星红旗。这个难忘的标志，录下了我和我的战友们陷身“羌塘无人区”七天七夜的一段不寻常经历。
    1980年10月，我和28名测绘战士接受了踏测“无人区”的任务。我担任领队。这个“无人区”平均海拔4500米以上，高寒缺氧，冰峰林立，气候无常，交通困难，人迹罕至，一度被称为“生命禁区”。正当我们历尽艰险完成这里的测绘任务外撤时，在昆仑山主峰——木孜塔格峰下，5辆汽车全部陷进了冰河。白天，昆仑山融化的雪水波涛滚滚；晚上，零下30多度的气温又把汽车和雪水牢牢冻在一起。唯一一辆能自救的绞盘车在冰天雪地里失去依托，也不能自拔了。
    方圆数千里杳无人烟，无法与外界取得联系，大雪封山的季节到了，食品和燃料所剩不多，面部冻裂、身体肿胀的战士们感到死神在一步步地逼近……白天，大伙一步一喘从山根搬来石块；晚上破冰跳入齐腰深的水里筑堰、往绞盘车车轮下塞石块。锋利的冰块像刀子一样割破了皮肉；冰凉的雪水像锥子一样刺透骨髓。那种滋味，简直叫人无法忍受。假如救车只是为了活命，我几乎宁愿躺下来永远和巍巍昆仑作伴，也不受这份罪。可是，为了在共和国的地图上消灭一个无图区，为了不辜负党和人民的重托，大家相互鼓励着，一定要咬紧牙关坚持到底，带着我们的资料走出无人区。
    一天、两天……六个昼夜过去了。尽管同志们绞尽脑汁，用尽全力，绞盘车却像在冰河里扎了根一样，一动不动。
    “中队长，我看咱们出不了‘无人区’啦。”刚17岁的牛志流泪了。
    “小牛，别泄气，我们战斗在祖国的怀抱里，就是车救不出来，党和人民也会千方百计来营救我们的。”
    “中队长，趁我们还有气力，把资料和成果密封好存放到安全的地方吧，再给党委详细写个思想汇报，万一我们出不去了，将来寻找我们的同志也能找到资料和情况……”
    听着大伙的议论，我禁不住流下了滚滚热泪。
    在对成果资料进行了妥善处理、食品和燃料也仔细作了筹划后，我们用测布做了一面鲜艳的五星红旗，让红旗在河岸上冉冉升起。大家列队在红旗下宣誓：亲爱的祖国，为了你的繁荣富强，我们活着为你奋斗不息，死了瞑目巍巍昆仑……有红旗在，就有我们的资料在，就有战士的忠心在！
    我们已决心破釜沉舟——拔下所有帐篷竿埋入地下牵引绞盘车。我们虽然已经精疲力尽，但飘展的红旗在唤醒我们最后的力量。从10月30日清晨起，头顶鹅毛大雪，同志们在铁板似的冻层上抡镐挖坑，经过10多个小时的努力，终于在千年冰封的河岸上凿出一条长两米的齐腰深沟。大家把20多根帐篷竿捆起来挂到绞盘车的钢丝绳上，然后放进沟底，浇水、填石、封土，让它和冰山雪峰紧紧冻结在一起。翌日一大早，同志们发疯似地抡起铁镐，击碎绞盘车四周的坚冰，20多人肩扛手推，在一片震动群山的号子里，绞盘车终于徐徐上岸。最后，我们把汽车一辆辆地拖出了冰河。
    “我们胜利了！我们胜利了！”
    同志们的呼声在“无人区”上空回荡。
    此后，每当我看到飘扬的五星红旗，就会想起“羌塘无人区”那冰天雪地的整整七个日夜……
