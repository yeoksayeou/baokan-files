	Returning Tibetan from India, Angao, is now 71 years old. He went to Tibet and India in 1958 to worship Buddha and later settled in India, where he opened a restaurant. In 1982, he returned to China to visit his family, and the significant changes in his hometown left a deep impression on him. The transformation of his homeland became a powerful call, prompting him to move his entire family back to their ancestral home.

	Upon his return, Angao was warmly welcomed. The government provided him with 12,000 yuan in resettlement funds and elected him as a member of the county and prefecture political consultative conference. Last year, the government also lent him 50,000 yuan to build a small building. The upper floor serves as his family's living quarters, the ground floor is his store, and the backyard is a small inn. Angao's store primarily sells ethnic and religious items, which are popular among Tibetan people and religious pilgrims visiting Labrang Monastery, making his business very prosperous.

　　归国藏胞经商致富
    昂考今年已经71岁了，他1958年到西藏和印度去朝佛，以后留居印度，开饭馆为业，1982年回国探亲，所到之处都给他留下了深刻的印象，家乡巨大的变化成为最有力的召唤，于是他举家迁回故乡。
    昂考回国后受到欢迎，政府发给他12000元的安置费。还选举他为县和州的政协委员。去年政府又给他贷款5万元，盖起了一座小楼，楼上是他全家的生活用房，楼下是他经营的商店，后院是小旅社。昂考的商店以经营民族用品和宗教用品为主，所以得到藏族群众和来拉卜楞寺朝拜的宗教信民的欢迎，生意十分兴隆。
