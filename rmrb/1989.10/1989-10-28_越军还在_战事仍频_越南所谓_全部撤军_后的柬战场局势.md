After Vietnam announced on September 26 that it had withdrawn all its troops from "Cambodia," people have been closely watching the situation on the Cambodian battlefield, particularly Vietnam's military movements in Cambodia. This is because Vietnam's withdrawal is suspect, and the facts over the past month have proven that Vietnam still has a large number of troops remaining in Cambodia.

Cambodian national resistance forces have revealed, based on the actual situation over the past month, that after Vietnam's alleged "complete withdrawal," it has redeployed its military forces in Cambodia. Firstly, Vietnam, based on its current control over Cambodia, has hidden or disguised its elite troops as fake military units in three key areas: Phnom Penh and its surrounding regions, eastern and southeastern Cambodia, and strategic locations in western and northern Cambodia. Among these, the largest number of Vietnamese troops are deployed in Phnom Penh and its surrounding areas. There are 50,000 Vietnamese troops in Phnom Penh alone. These troops, in addition to being disguised as fake military units, are also disguised as police. In eastern Cambodia, such as the provinces of Kampong Cham, Takeo, Kampong Speu, Kandal, Kratie, and Kampong Thom, Vietnam has not only disguised and incorporated part of its troops into the local fake military units but has also hidden another part of its troops in the jungle. The purpose of this is to strengthen the defense of the aforementioned regions and to observe the situation on the western border of Cambodia, ready to provide reinforcements at any time. As for the Cambodian-Vietnamese border region, Vietnamese troops can move in and out freely. In the Cambodian-Thai border region, Vietnam is afraid of exposing the truth about its hidden troops, so it has reduced its troop presence in this area, except for important cities and strategic locations, which are guarded by Heng Samrin's troops, while the Vietnamese troops hide in the shadows to command and supervise.

Secondly, Vietnam has left behind a large number of "education and propaganda teams." These teams include Vietnamese military advisors, weapons experts, intelligence personnel, and armed military personnel, with varying numbers in each team. They wear fake military uniforms or civilian clothes and are distributed throughout the country. Their tasks include controlling the fake local government in Cambodia, guiding and training fake military units in combat, and organizing and strengthening local defense forces.

In addition, Vietnam is quickly expanding the military strength of Heng Samrin's troops. Apart from transferring a large number of weapons and equipment to the fake military, Vietnam is also frantically expanding its manpower. Over the past month, the Vietnamese puppet regime, according to its new conscription law, has been forcibly recruiting men aged 16 to 45 in the areas under its control. According to defectors from Heng Samrin's troops who have surrendered to the Cambodian national resistance forces, the Vietnamese puppet regime has been forcibly conscripting people day and night in both urban and rural areas, leaving the common people with nowhere to hide. Some villages are left with only the elderly, women, and children.

Based on the new deployment of Vietnamese-Heng Samrin troops, the Cambodian national resistance forces have first launched attacks on the enemy in the Cambodian-Thai border region. They have adopted a combination of guerrilla warfare and concentrated annihilation tactics, capturing many positions and expanding the liberated areas. Since the end of September, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea first captured an enemy stronghold near Banteay Meas in Battambang Province, then advanced to the outskirts of Banteay Meas City, and at dawn on October 22, captured Banteay Meas County. Observers here believe that the resistance forces' capture of Banteay Meas can advance towards Battambang City, thus opening up a new situation on the battlefield. The other two factions of the Cambodian national resistance forces have also strengthened their offensives in the border areas. In early October, the National Army of Khmer People's National Liberation Front, with the support of the United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia, first captured the city of Tmo'b in the northwest of Battambang Province, and then captured the city of Pursat. Over the past month, the National Army of Khmer People's National Liberation Front has also captured 14 Vietnamese puppet military strongholds in the provinces of Oddar Meanchey and Siem Reap. The United National Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia has captured six Vietnamese puppet military strongholds in the area of Sisophon and controlled some regions, capturing a large number of fake soldiers. They have stated that as long as the Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia and Vietnam continues to control and support the Phnom Penh regime, refusing a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian problem, they will continue to fight until the final victory. Currently, the Cambodian national resistance forces are continuing to advance into the interior of Cambodia along the Cambodian-Thai border, and the fighting is becoming increasingly intense.

### 越军还在  战事仍频——越南所谓“全部撤军”后的柬战场局势

　　越军还在  战事仍频
　　——越南所谓“全部撤军”后的柬战场局势
　　本报记者　刘爱成
    9月26日越南宣称已从“柬埔寨撤出全部军队”后，人们对柬战场局势，尤其是对越南在柬的军事动向极为关注。这是因为越南“撤军”令人怀疑，而且一个月来的事实证明，越南确有大量部队继续留在柬埔寨。
    柬埔寨民族抵抗力量人士根据一个月来的实际情况揭露，越南在所谓“全部撤军”后，对其在柬的军事力量重新作了部署。首先，越南根据它目前对柬的控制情况，将其精锐部队隐藏或通过化装成伪军部署在三个重要地区。即：金边及金边周围地区、柬东及柬越边境地区和柬西、北部战略要地。其中以部署在金边和金边周围地区的越军最多。仅金边市就有5万越军。这些军队除化装成伪军外，还化装成警察。在柬埔寨东部，如磅湛、磅清扬、波萝勉、干丹、柴桢及桔井等省，越南除了将其部分部队化装和编入伪军地方部队外，还将另一部分部队隐藏在丛林中。其目的一是为了加强上述地区的防卫；二是为了观望柬西边境地区战况，随时准备增援。至于柬越边境地区，越军调进调出，畅通无阻。在柬泰边境地区，越南害怕暴露藏兵真相，减少了在这一地区的兵力，除重要城镇和战略要地外，均让韩桑林部队把守，越军躲在暗处督战指挥。
    其次，越南留下大量的“教育宣传队”。宣传队中有越南军事顾问、武器技术专家、情报人员及武装军事人员，各队数量不等。他们穿着伪军军装或普通老百姓服装，分布在全国各地。其任务是控制柬伪地方政府、指导和训练伪军作战，以及组织加强地方防卫力量。
    此外，越南正加紧扩充韩桑林部队军事力量。除了将大批武器装备转交给伪军外，还拚命扩大兵员。一个月来，越伪政权根据新的征兵法，在其控制地区强迫16岁至45岁的男子当兵。据向柬民族抵抗力量投诚的韩桑林部队士兵透露，越伪政权在城乡不分白天黑夜地抓兵，已使老百姓无处可藏，有的村庄只剩下老人、妇女和儿童。
    柬民族抵抗力量根据越南—韩桑林部队上述兵力新部署，首先在柬泰边境地区向敌军发动进攻。他们采用游击战和集中兵力打歼灭战相结合的战术，夺取了不少阵地，扩大了解放区。自9月底以来，民柬国民军首先攻占马德望省拜林附近的敌军据点，然后直逼拜林城下，于10月22日凌晨攻下了拜林县城。此间观察家认为，抵抗力量占领拜林，可以进逼马德望市，从而在战场上打开新局面。柬民族抵抗力量其他两派也分别在边境一带加强了攻势。本月上旬，西哈努克民族军在高棉人民民族解放阵线部队配合下，先攻占了马德望省西北部的特莫博县城，接着又攻占了普农斯罗县城。一个月来，西哈努克民族军还在奥多棉吉、暹粒两省占领了14个越伪军据点。高棉人民民族解放阵线部队在诗梳风一带先后占领了6个越伪军据点，并控制了一些地区，俘虏了大批伪军。他们表示，只要越军仍然留在柬埔寨，越南继续在控制和扶植金边政权，不同意全面政治解决柬问题，他们就将继续战斗下去，直至最后胜利。目前，柬民族抵抗力量正在柬泰边境一线继续向柬内地推进，战斗越来越激烈。
