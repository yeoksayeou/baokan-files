Premier Li Peng of the State Council inspected several venues for the Asian Games and the Beijing-Sanyo Color Picture Tube Co., Ltd. in Beijing on the afternoon of October 18.

During the inspection, Premier Li Peng said that the Party and government leaders of Beijing, along with the broad masses of workers, had made significant contributions in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, defending our capital. He pointed out that after this turmoil, Beijing quickly restored normal order. Although some areas in Beijing are still under martial law, all work has resumed, and everyone is very happy. This symbolizes the prosperity and stability of our country.

At around 3 PM, Premier Li Peng first visited the University Gymnasium for the Asian Games. He enthusiastically watched the training of young athletes from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education and Sports School and inquired about the construction and usage of the gymnasium. Before leaving, he happily took a group photo with the young athletes.

The Asian Games project, after three years of hard work by tens of thousands of builders, is nearing completion. Most of the 33 competition venues have been completed, and the construction of the athletes' village is in its final stages. The entire project will be completed by May of next year. Premier Li Peng went to the North Suburb Sports Center of the Asian Games and stood on an elevated bridge overlooking this magnificent construction site. He happily said: Holding the Asian Games is not only a major event for Beijing but also for the entire nation. It can not only revitalize our sports industry but also drive progress in many areas, showcasing the strength of our country and people. He said, Beijing has invested a lot in the construction of the Asian Games project, and the people of the whole country have supported you. You must ensure the quality and timeline of the project. The people of the entire city and the entire nation should unite to welcome the Asian Games next year, host a successful Asian Games, and bring glory to Beijing and the motherland.

As Premier Li Peng walked down the elevated bridge, the builders enthusiastically applauded. Premier Li Peng waved to everyone, greeted them, and walked over to shake hands with the workers around him, repeatedly saying, "Thank you, thank you!"

Premier Li Peng has always been concerned about the construction of the Beijing-Sanyo Color Picture Tube Co., Ltd. He visited the company in December last year and encouraged it to become a model for Sino-foreign joint ventures, with product quality reaching world-class standards.

In the afternoon of October 18, Premier Li Peng left the Asian Games construction site and visited the joint venture company again. He first took a group photo with representatives from both the Chinese and Japanese sides and then carefully inspected the production process of color picture tubes. He listened to the company's general manager, Mr. Shibukawa Masayoshi, introduce the company's production situation. Premier Li Peng praised the company for its fast construction speed, budget adherence, and completion two months ahead of schedule. He said that the practice has proven that joint ventures in China have great prospects. If anyone does not believe in China's investment environment, they can come to the Beijing-Sanyo Color Picture Tube Co., Ltd. to see for themselves.

Premier Li Peng emphasized that our reform and opening-up policy remains unchanged, and we hope to attract more foreign investment to cooperate with China. This cooperation should be equal and mutually beneficial. He said, China has its own advantages, first of all, the advantage of labor resources. Moreover, the cultural level in the Beijing area is relatively high, and workers have a certain level of knowledge. After short-term training, they can handle the job. At the same time, there are also conditions for land, electricity, water sources, and other municipal facilities. Therefore, investing in China is beneficial for both Chinese and foreign parties. He hopes that foreign business circles with foresight can draw inspiration from Sanyo's cooperation with China.

Premier Li Peng thanked Mr. Shibukawa and the Japanese staff for continuing to work during China's difficult times; he also thanked the Chinese leaders, engineers, and workers for staying at their posts and working hard during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot. Premier Li Peng praised the company for having a good work ethic.

Premier Li Peng said that China's market has changed, and a buyer's market has emerged. The days of comfortably running a factory and living an easy life are probably over. The market is becoming more competitive. For those who want to stand firm in the market, it is very important to have good product quality, suitable varieties, and lower costs. This provides an opportunity for enterprises to improve. In this sense, it is a good phenomenon.

Those accompanying Premier Li Peng on the inspection included Li Ximing, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, Chen Xitong, State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, Luo Gan, Secretary-General of the State Council, He Zhenliang, Deputy Director of the State Sports Commission and Executive Vice Chairman of the Asian Games Organizing Committee, Zhang Baifeng, Executive Vice Mayor of Beijing and Executive Vice Chairman of the Asian Games Organizing Committee, Wu Yi, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Advisor Zhang Peng.

    李鹏在京视察亚运会部分场馆时说
    办好亚运会为祖国争光
    同日视察北京·松下彩色显象管有限公司
    指出实践证明在中国搞合资企业大有希望
    新华社北京10月19日电　（记者李莉）国务院总理李鹏18日下午在北京视察了亚运会部分场馆和北京·松下彩色显象管有限公司。
    李鹏总理在视察时说：北京市的党政领导和广大职工在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱中立了功劳，捍卫了我们的首都。他指出，这场风波过去以后，北京很快地恢复了正常秩序。虽然现在北京部分地区还在戒严，但各项工作已恢复正常，大家都很高兴。这象征着我们国家的繁荣和巩固。
    下午3时许，李鹏总理首先来到亚运会大学生体育馆，兴致勃勃地观看了正在馆内训练的北京体育师范学院竞技体校小运动员的表演，询问了这个馆的建设、使用功能等情况。临走前，他愉快地和小运动员们合影留念。
    亚运会工程经过数万建设者3年的奋战，现在接近尾声，33个比赛场馆绝大部分已经竣工，运动员村的建设也已进入后期，全部工程将在明年5月前完成。李鹏总理来到亚运会北郊体育中心，登上高架桥环顾这片景象壮观的建设工地。他高兴地说：举办亚运会不仅是北京市的一件大事，也是全国的一件大事。它不仅可以振兴我们的体育事业，而且可带动多方面工作，是我们国家和人民力量的一种显示。他说，北京为建设亚运会工程花了很大力量，全国人民也支援了你们，你们一定要保证工程质量、保证工期。全市人民、全国人民要团结起来，迎接明年的亚运会，把亚运会办好，为北京争光，为祖国争光。
    李鹏总理走下高架桥时，建设者们热烈地鼓掌欢迎。李鹏总理招手向大家问好，并走过去同周围的工人们亲切握手，连连说：“谢谢你们，谢谢你们！”
    李鹏总理对北京·松下彩色显象管有限公司的建设很关心，去年12月曾前来视察，勉励这家公司要成为中外合资企业的典范，产品质量达到世界第一流的水平。
    18日下午，李鹏总理离开亚运会工地后，又一次来到这家合资企业。他首先和中日合资双方代表合影留念，然后仔细地视察了彩色显象管生产过程，听取了公司总经理蜷川亲义先生关于公司生产情况的介绍。李鹏总理赞扬这家公司建设速度快，投资没有超过预算，提前两个月建成，并迅速达到了单班生产的数量和质量要求。他说，实践证明，在中国搞合资企业是大有希望的，如果谁不相信中国的投资环境，可以请他到北京·松下彩色显象管有限公司来看一看。
    李鹏总理强调指出，我们的改革、开放政策不变，希望吸引更多的外资到中国来合作，这种合作应该是平等互利的。他说，中国有自己的优势，首先是劳动力资源的优势，而且北京地区文化水平比较高，劳动者有一定的知识，经过短期训练后，就可以胜任。同时，还有土地的条件以及电力、水源等市政条件的配合。所以，到中国来投资，对中外双方都是有好处的，希望外国工商企业界有识之士能够从松下与中国的合作中受到启发。
    李鹏总理感谢蜷川先生和日方人员在中国困难的时期仍然坚持工作；感谢中方领导干部、工程技术人员和工人在动乱和反革命暴乱期间坚守岗位，努力工作。李鹏总理赞扬这家公司有很好的厂风。
    李鹏总理说，中国的市场发生了变化，出现了买方市场，那种舒舒服服地办厂过日子的时候恐怕是过去了，市场开始严峻起来，谁想在市场上站住脚，很重要的是产品质量要好，花色品种要适销对路，成本要降低，这就给企业提供了一个进步的机会。从这个意义上讲，是一个好的现象。
    陪同李鹏总理视察的有中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭，国务委员、北京市市长陈希同，国务院秘书长罗干，国家体委副主任、亚运会组委会常务副主席何振梁，北京市常务副市长、亚运会组委会常务副主席张百发，北京市副市长吴仪，顾问张彭等。
