Sudanese government troops have withdrawn from the border town of Kormu in the south after intense shelling by anti-government forces. The military announced on the 29th that this was a "tactical withdrawal." The statement said that the fighting in Kormu, located 600 kilometers south of the capital Khartoum, would disrupt efforts to end the six-and-a-half-year-long civil war.

The government troops had reached a ceasefire agreement with the Sudan People's Liberation Army, led by Garang, seven months ago. However, the ceasefire was violated earlier this month.

According to the Sudan People's Liberation Army radio, the fighting in Kormu was triggered by an "unprovoked offensive" launched by the government troops on October 16th.

The military statement mentioned that some foreign military experts were seen commanding and managing the anti-government forces, but their nationalities were unknown. The Sudanese government accused Cuba of providing military training and experts to the anti-government forces. The statement also accused Ethiopia of supporting the anti-government forces.

　　苏丹政府军撤离库尔穆城
    苏丹军方二十九日发表声明说，在反政府武装进行激烈的炮击后，苏丹政府军已经撤离南部边境城镇库尔穆。声明称这是政府军的“战术撤军”。声明说，距首都喀土穆以南六百公里的库尔穆发生的战斗将破坏为结束持续六年半的内战所作的努力。
    政府军在七个月前同加朗领导的反政府的苏丹人民解放军达成了停火协议。但是，本月初停火遭到破坏。
    据苏丹人民解放军电台报道，库尔穆镇发生的战斗是政府军十月十六日发起“无缘无故的攻势”而引起的。
    军方声明说，有人看到一些外国军事专家在指挥和管理反政府武装，但他们的国籍不详。苏丹政府指责古巴向反政府武装提供军事训练和军事专家。声明还指责埃塞俄比亚支持反政府武装。
