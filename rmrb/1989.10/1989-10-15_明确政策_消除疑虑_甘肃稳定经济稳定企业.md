    Clarify Policies and Eliminate Doubts
    Gansu Stabilizes Economy and Enterprises

    LANZHOU, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- To address the doubts among some enterprise managers and workers, Gansu Provincial Governor Jia Zhijie clearly announced the "four unchanging and one non-revoking" principles: the contract responsibility system will not change, the manager responsibility system will not change, the basic policies of enterprise reform will not change, and the preferential policies for the five experimental zones in the upper reaches of the Yellow River will not change; the powers delegated to enterprises will not be revoked.

    The governor made these remarks at a meeting of party secretaries and managers of enterprises in Lanzhou, where they discussed how to use Jiang Zemin's speech as a guide to further deepen reforms and revitalize enterprises.

    Jia Zhijie said that the contract responsibility system has its advantages and disadvantages, but overall, it has been successful and should continue to be implemented and improved in practice. The manager responsibility system is the basic leadership system for Chinese enterprises as stipulated by the Enterprise Law and must be firmly implemented. The position of the manager in enterprise administration and production operations must be firmly established and cannot be shaken.

    When discussing how to revitalize large and medium-sized enterprises, Governor Jia Zhijie said that these enterprises bear more than 70% of the province's production tasks and 80% of fiscal revenue, making them the backbone of Gansu's national economy. Therefore, revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises has always been the focus of enterprise reform. The policies adopted for contracted enterprises, loss-making enterprises, and enterprises with linked labor efficiency should continue to be implemented, and these enterprises should be given priority support from various aspects to help them overcome difficulties.

    Provincial Party Secretary Li Zichi emphasized in his speech that stability in policies and minds is key to achieving stability in the economy and enterprises.

    明确政策　消除疑虑
    甘肃稳定经济稳定企业
    本报兰州10月14日电  记者张述圣报道：针对当前部分企业干部职工思想上的疑虑，甘肃省省长贾志杰明确宣布“四不变一不收”，即：承包经营责任制不变，厂长（经理）负责制不变，企业改革的基本政策不变，黄河上游经济开发5个试验小区优惠政策不变；下放给企业的权力不收。
    这位省长是日前在兰州地区企业党委书记、厂长会议上，讨论如何以江泽民同志的讲话为指针，进一步深化改革、搞活企业时发表这番讲话的。
    贾志杰说，承包经营责任制利弊得失都有，但总体上是成功的，要继续坚持实行，并在实践中不断完善。厂长（经理）负责制是《企业法》确定的我国企业的基本领导体制，要继续坚决贯彻执行，不能回到老路上去。要坚决确立厂长（经理）在企业行政指挥和生产经营中的中心地位，丝毫不能动摇。
    在谈到如何搞活大中型企业时，贾志杰省长说，大中型企业承担着全省70％以上的生产任务和80％的财政创收任务，是甘肃国民经济的支柱。因此，搞活大中型企业始终是企业改革的重点，对承包企业、亏损企业、工效挂钩企业，已采取的政策要继续执行，并且从多方面给予重点扶持，帮助一些企业摆脱困境。
    省委书记李子奇在会上讲话时强调，要通过稳定政策、稳定人心，实现稳定经济、稳定企业。
