In recent years, with the development of urban and rural construction, some counties have successively been upgraded to cities, and their subordinate townships have been changed to towns accordingly. It should be said that this is a necessary phenomenon in the process of economic development and is not a bad thing. However, it is worth noting that some places have blindly started a wave of "upgrading fever."

For example, some counties and townships, in order to be upgraded, have engaged in large-scale construction, building streets and roads, occupying a large amount of arable land, duplicating departmental construction, and farmers blindly moving to urban areas, thereby weakening agriculture.

An administrative unit of a certain level must have corresponding economic, political, and cultural strength. Some counties and townships do not meet the conditions for upgrading. Apart from the change in name, there is almost no other change. The economic development level of these places is not high, and the large amount of funds spent on urban construction cannot produce benefits in the short term, but rather hinder the development of the local economy.

Why are these places, which do not yet meet the conditions, so eager to "upgrade"? It is said that one very important reason is that "a low administrative level is not 'popular,' is not conducive to reform and opening up, and affects economic prosperity." In fact, whether or not something is "popular" depends on whether or not one works diligently and practically. If one does not work practically but only seeks empty fame, no matter how high the "level," it is just an empty shell, and if not handled properly, it may even become a burden on economic construction.

　　滥升格何益之有？
　　亚农
    近年来，随着城乡建设的发展，一些县相继升格为市，所属乡也相应改为镇。应当说，这是经济发展过程中的必然现象，并不是什么坏事。但是值得注意的是，一些地方盲目地兴起了一股“升格热”。
    例如，有些县、乡为了升格，大兴土木，建街修路，耕地被大量占用，部门建设重复，农民盲目向城镇搬迁，农业反而被削弱了。
    一定级别的行政单元，必须具备相应的经济、政治、文化实力。有少数县、乡并不具备升格条件，除了名称变了外，其他几乎并没有什么变化，这些地方的经济发展程度不高，而城镇建设占用的大量资金，短时期内难以产生效益，反而影响了地方经济的发展。
    这些条件尚不成熟的地方为什么这样热衷于“升格”呢？据说一个很重要的原因是，“行政规格低，不‘吃香’，不利于改革开放，影响经济繁荣。”其实，吃不吃“香”，关键的问题不在于是否升格，而在于是否脚踏实地地工作。不务实而只图虚名，“规格”再高，也只是一个空壳子，搞不好还会成为经济建设的包袱。
