Egyptian President Mubarak stated on October 10 that he plans to meet with Libyan leader Gaddafi to further promote the development of relations between the two countries.

Mubarak mentioned during a meeting with officers that the specific time for his meeting with Gaddafi will be announced at an appropriate time. According to Egyptian diplomats stationed in Tunis last week, the meeting between Mubarak and Gaddafi is likely to take place this month at the border between the two countries.

In May of this year, Mubarak and Gaddafi held talks in Casablanca, Morocco, resolving long-standing disputes between the two countries. Shortly after, the two countries reopened their borders and resumed land and air transportation.

    穆巴拉克宣布将同卡扎菲会晤
    埃及总统穆巴拉克十日表示，他计划同利比亚领导人卡扎菲举行会晤，以便进一步推动两国关系的发展。
    穆巴拉克在一次军官会议上说，他同卡扎菲会晤的具体时间将在适当的时候宣布。据驻突尼斯的埃及外交官上星期说，穆巴拉克与卡扎菲的会晤有可能于本月在两国边境举行。
    今年五月，穆巴拉克和卡扎菲曾在摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡举行了会谈，解决了两国长期存在的矛盾。不久，两国重新开放边界，恢复了陆路和空中的交通。
