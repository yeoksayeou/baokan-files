Four Corners

Tangshan, historically known for its severe pollution, has combined its post-earthquake reconstruction efforts with significant investments to address its major pollution sources. The city has invested one billion yuan to control the "four dragons" of red, yellow, black, and white pollutants in the sky above the urban area. Simultaneously, effective measures have been taken to prevent the emergence of new pollution sources. Compared to ten years ago, the city's emissions of smoke and dust have decreased from 41.76 million tons per year to 21 million tons, and the total suspended particulate matter has dropped from 1,440 micrograms to 593 micrograms, meeting the national third-level standard.

    唐山治污染天空“阴转晴”
    本报讯  历史上污染较为严重的唐山市，结合震后恢复建设，先后投资一亿元，对市区上空的红、黄、黑、白“四条龙”等老污染源进行限期治理。同时，有效地防止了新污染源的产生。同十年前相比，市区烟粉尘排放量由每年四十一点七六万吨减少到二十一万吨，总悬浮微粒由一千四百四十微克降到五百九十三微克，达到国家三级标准。
