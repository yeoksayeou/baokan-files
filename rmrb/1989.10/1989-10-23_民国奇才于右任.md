It is well-known that Mr. Yu Youren was an outstanding figure in modern Chinese history. He was not only highly accomplished in calligraphy and poetry but also a sincere patriot. In his early years, he followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the National Revolution and later served as the President of the Control Yuan of the Nationalist Party. Throughout his decades-long political career, he consistently advocated for cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists to save China, firmly believing that "unity brings mutual benefit, while division leads to mutual loss." Before the liberation of the mainland, his wish to stay in mainland China was not realized, and he was forced to go to Taiwan. He never saw the realization of his wish to see a unified China in his lifetime. In 1962, two years before his death, the then over eighty-year-old Yu Youren wrote in his illness, "Bury me on the high mountain, overlooking the mainland; the mainland cannot be seen, only tears flow." These lines express his longing for his homeland and his hope for national reunification. For such an outstanding patriot, although we have published his calligraphy, poetry, and some biographical materials, I have not heard of any literary biographies about him published on the mainland.

The authors of "A Remarkable Figure of the Republic: Yu Youren," Chen Sizhang and Pan Zhixin, are two middle-aged individuals from Yu Youren's hometown. To complete this biography, they searched through vast amounts of materials and visited Yu Youren's old friends and relatives to uncover hidden stories. After two years of hard work, they finally completed this 200,000-word book.

This biography successfully portrays Yu Youren's era and his life in a vivid and substantial manner, avoiding shallowness and constraint. This demonstrates the authors' deep consideration in selecting materials and their concise and succinct writing style. Moreover, in balancing factual accuracy and literary quality, the authors have done a good job. As the authors mentioned in the afterword, "Writing a biography is not like writing a novel; one cannot fabricate or exaggerate, but must respect historical truth, connect events, and depict characters." Because of this, the book reads as genuine and intimate.

### 民国奇才于右任

专栏：品书札记

　　民国奇才于右任
　　张征
    众所周知，于右任先生是中国近代史上的一位杰出人物，他不仅在书法、诗词方面有很高的造诣，而且是一位真诚的爱国者。他早年追随孙中山先生进行国民革命，后出任国民党监察院院长。在几十年的政治生涯中，一直主张国共合作救中国，坚信“合则两益，离则两损”。大陆解放前夕，他留在祖国大陆的愿望没能实现，被胁迫去台湾，有生之年未能如愿见到祖国统一。1962年，即辞世前两年，年逾八旬的于右任先生于病中写下了“葬我于高山之上兮，望我大陆；大陆不可见兮，只有痛哭”的诗句，表达了他怀念故土、盼望祖国统一的心情。对于这样一位杰出的爱国人物，以前，我们虽出版过他的书法、诗文以及一些资料性的传记文字，但关于他的文学传记，我尚未听说大陆有版本。
      《民国奇才于右任》的作者陈四长和潘志新，是于右任故乡的两位中年人。为完成这部传记，他们一方面从浩如烟海的资料堆里寻找发现，一方面从于右任的故旧亲朋那里访知秘事，经过两年的辛苦锤炼，终于写下了这部20万字的著作。
    这部传记能大气势地将于右任的时代和于右任的一生写得充实生动，不显单薄、局促，足见作者谋篇选材的深思熟虑和文字表达的简约凝练。而且，在真实性与文学性的统一方面，作者也处理得比较好。正如作者在后记中说的，“写传不是写小说，不能虚构渲染，任意发挥，只能尊重历史的真实连缀情节，刻画人物。”正因为如此，该书读来真实亲切。
