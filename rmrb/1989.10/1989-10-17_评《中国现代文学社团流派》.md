Review of "Chinese Modern Literary Groups and Schools"
Luán Méi Jiān

Upon examining the development and evolution of Chinese modern literature research since the new period, one cannot help but feel exhilarated to discover that after a decade of accumulation and exploration, Chinese modern literature research has achieved new progress.

A group of researchers, based on numerous completed individual research papers and material excavations, have contributed a batch of systematic, high-quality research monographs and collections of essays. The book "Chinese Modern Literary Groups and Schools" (edited by Jiǎ Zhí Fāng, with Zēng Huá Péng and Fàn Bó Qún as deputy editors, published by Jiangsu Education Press in May 1989, hereinafter referred to as "Groups and Schools") marks this new achievement of "comprehensive" research.

The editors selected 33 influential groups and schools in modern literature and invited editors who have diligently collected materials and scholars who have conducted in-depth research on related groups and schools to engage in a large-scale discussion in the form of essays. The book evaluates the important groups and schools in Chinese modern literature from a theoretical perspective, summarizes the experiences and lessons of these groups and schools, and provides a guiding textbook for students majoring in Chinese modern literature, as well as a reference for domestic and international researchers. Therefore, "Groups and Schools" is a history of the changes in Chinese modern literature written from the perspective of the rise and fall of groups and schools.

Due to the efforts of years of material organization and collection, many articles in "Groups and Schools" provide exclusive materials that have not been discovered by researchers in the past, and draw reasonable and convincing conclusions. For example, regarding the founding time and place of the Qiǎo Cǎo Society, all previous literary history books have determined that it "originated in Shanghai in 1924." Author Zhāng Xiǎo Cuī, based on the article published by one of the founders of the Qiǎo Cǎo Society, Chén Huī Mó, in 1924, which involves the founding time of the society, and cross-referenced with the recollections of another member of the Qiǎo Cǎo Society, Fénɡ Zhì, finally concluded that it was "no later than February 1922," and that the founding and activity center should be Beijing and Shanghai. Another example is the issue of the founders of the People's Drama Society. Dǒng Xiào Chāng's introduction to the literary achievements of the earliest new literary group in Zhejiang, the Chénɡuānɡ Society, and its relationship with the Hu Pánɡ Poetry Society, has given people a new understanding and recognition of these literary groups.

More importantly, research papers produced on the basis of mastering materials not only correct historical errors, touch on research fields that are rarely explored due to material limitations, but also provide objective and comprehensive evaluations of deeply researched groups and schools based on their historical appearances, maintaining a fair and cautious attitude in their views. For example, in "Symbolist Poetry," Sūn Yù Shí, through a detailed and subtle analysis of some important symbolist poems, believes that symbolist poetry, in terms of its external connections, that is, the relationship between poetry and social life and the significance of the times, has become narrow; but in terms of its internal connections, that is, the relationship between poetry and the poet's inner world, it has delved deeper. This avoids the bias of either complete denial or excessive praise. Another example is the literary advocacy of the Creation Society. Zhū Shòu Tónɡ believes that the writers of the Creation Society do not acknowledge the traditional classification of "life school" and "art school," nor do they fully accept the slogan of "art for art's sake," but only recognize that literature is an expression of "self-internal demands" and "vital impulses." Therefore, he boldly concludes that the Creation Society is a "group image of art for self-expression." Because this view comes from the author's comprehensive analysis of a large amount of material, it is also more in line with the actual situation of the Creation Society. The book "Groups and Schools" pays sufficient attention to groups that have played an important role and had a far-reaching influence in modern literary history, such as the New Youth—New Tide Society, the Literary Research Society, and the Chinese Left-Wing Writers' League. It also pays attention to groups that were previously less familiar or discussed too simply, such as the Butterfly—Saturday School, Xué Hénɡ, Jiǎ Yín, "Free People"—"Third Kind of People," "Warring States Strategy School," and "Nine Leaves" Poetry School. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of literary groups in anti-Japanese democratic bases and liberated areas, and also conducts an initial review of literary groups in Shanghai, North China, and Northeast occupied periods.

In terms of writing style, "Groups and Schools" uses essays as the main body, followed by a list of reference books and main materials after each essay. Therefore, this collection of essays, totaling 900,000 words, is not only a work with a certain academic authority and preservation value, but also provides important clues for further research.

    评《中国现代文学社团流派》
    栾梅健
    审视新时期以来中国现代文学研究的衍进演变及其走向，人们不无振奋地发现：在经过了十年的积累与探索之后，中国现代文学研究得到了新的发展。
    一批研究工作者在已经完成的众多的单个研究论文与资料发掘的基础上，奉献出一批系统的高质量的研究专著和论文集。贾植芳主编、曾华鹏与范伯群为副主编的《中国现代文学社团流派》（江苏教育出版社1989年5月版，以下简称《流派》）的问世，昭示了这种“综合”的新成果。
    主编选定33个在现代文学中有一定影响的社团和流派，约请下过扎实的搜罗功夫的编选者与对有关社团、流派作过深入研究的学者，以论文的形式进行一次大型笔谈，对中国现代文学中的重要社团流派进行理论上的评价，总结这些社团流派的经验教训，为中国现代文学专业的学生提供一部具有指导性的读物，并供国内外研究者参考。因此，《流派》一书是从社团流派发展盛衰的视角写出的一部中国现代文学的流变史。
    由于得力于多年的资料整理收集工作，《流派》中的不少文章提供了过去未曾为研究者发现的独家材料，并作了言之有理、令人信服的结论。例如，关于浅草社的成立时间与地点，过去所有的文学史著作都认定，“1924年发祥于上海”。作者张晓萃根据查到的浅草社发起人之一的陈炜谟在1924年发表的涉及该社成立时间的文章，并与浅草社另一成员冯至的回忆材料相印证，最后得出“至迟不晚于1922年2月”、“成立和活动中心应该是北京和上海”的可靠结论。又如民众戏剧社的发起者问题，董校昌对浙江最早的新文学团体晨光社的文学实绩以及它与湖畔诗社之间关系等的介绍，使人们对这些文艺社团有了新的了解与认识。
    更为重要的是，在掌握资料的基础上产生的研究论文，不仅能订正那些史实上的谬误，接触到因资料限制而很少有人涉及的研究园地，而且，能对深入研究过的社团流派按其历史原貌作客观而全面的评述，在观点上持公允审慎的态度。如孙玉石在《象征派诗》中，通过对一些重要的象征派诗具体而细腻的分析，认为象征派诗就诗的外部联系，即诗与社会生活、诗与时代意义来说，是走向狭窄了；而在诗的内部联系，即诗与诗人内心世界的关系来说，却是走向更深远的开掘。这就避免了或是全面否定、或是过于夸大赞美的偏颇。再如创造社的文学主张，朱寿桐认为创造社作家根本不承认“人生派”与“艺术派”的传统分类，也没有全部接受“为艺术而艺术”的口号，而只是认定文学是“自我内心要求”、“生命冲动”的表现，因此，他大胆地认定创造社是一个“为自我表现而艺术的团体形象”。由于这一提法来自作者对大量材料的全面分析，因而也就更贴合于创造社的实际。《流派》一书对过去在现代文学史上起过重要作用和发挥深远影响的社团，如新青年—新潮社、文学研究会、中国左翼作家联盟等，给予足够的重视；对过去不大熟悉或论述过于简单的鸳鸯蝴蝶—《礼拜六》派、学衡、甲寅、“自由人”—“第三种人”、“战国策派”、“九叶”诗派，也予以关照。既对抗日民主根据地和解放区的文学社团有全面述评，也对上海、华北、东北沦陷时期的文学社团进行了初步的审视。
    在编写体例上，《流派》一书以论文为主体，再于每篇论文之后附以参考书目录与主要资料。因此，这部90万字的论文集不仅是一部具有一定学术权威性和有保留价值的著作，而且也为人们的进一步研究提供了重要的线索。
