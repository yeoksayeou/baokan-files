They entered the village. A team of only two people, yet they added two green notes to an ancient and yellowed folk song.

At the end of the Yellow River, there is a small village. Perhaps because it is too small and desolate, or too remote and poor, it has never had a name. Before liberation, a wealthy landlord hired a shepherd here, and from then on, people called it the Shepherd's Workshop. After liberation, many years later, a literate person in the village gave it a name—Xinsheng. Although the name "Xinsheng" is loud and pleasant, the village remains small, desolate, and poor. Perhaps because it is located on the old course of the Yellow River, the entire desolation, loneliness, and poverty of Xinsheng can be summed up in one word—yellow: they grow up on yellow earth, live in yellow earth houses, eat yellow mustard greens, drink yellow soup, their hungry faces are like yellow paper, and after death, they are buried in yellow dust. In short, the fate of the people here is more bitter than bitter herbs.

Yellow! Yellow! Yellow! Will the yellow calendar of Xinsheng people forever be filled with the word "hunger" and "poverty"?

In the spring of 1986, the vast land of the Republic was already lush with greenery, and the mountains were verdant. However, the land here was still sleeping...

On a day when the sand was swirling, just as the rooster crowed for the first time at dawn, an unusual sound of footsteps came from the southeast corner of Xinsheng Village, disturbing the ancient silence and waking people from their dreams.

The footsteps stopped, and people were surprised to find that it was a team of only two people. Leading the way was a broad-faced man. The village children, who had never seen the world, followed behind these two people in green uniforms, chirping like a flock of little birds, occasionally shouting, "Soldiers! Soldiers are coming!"

This broad-faced man with a thick black beard on his cheeks was called Dai Yongchang, the head of the Dongying City Hekou District Military Sub-district. The other was Zhang Baojin, the head of the Political Work Section of the Military Sub-district. As soon as they stepped into the village, their two pairs of greedy eyes scanned from the village entrance to the end, from the courtyard to the riverbank. They paused in front of the broken stone mill and gazed into the low, dilapidated mud houses. Their moving figures were like two green clouds, drifting back and forth. In the eyes of the old people, they seemed to recall the green fields of their childhood. Had the long-lost spring finally descended upon the wasteland of Xinsheng? The old people rubbed their sleepy eyes, looking at these two green messengers.

The sun rose to the height of a pole, and they walked one after the other into the home of Chen Guolin, the then village party branch secretary. Chen Guolin's home had only three small, dilapidated mud houses. The house was empty and dark, and at first glance, nothing could be seen. The pungent smell of mold stung the nose, and only the sound of a group of rats scurrying in the corner of the wall could be heard.

"Is the house too narrow? Let's go to the courtyard to chat." The three people had only two small stools, and the other had to sit on a brick. Their conversation was a bit awkward. Chen Guolin's slow and dull manner made people anxious. You ask a question, he answers a question. If you don't ask, he won't say a word for half a day. Perhaps people still don't know that Chen Guolin, in addition to not receiving a penny for his 15 years as a party branch secretary, also owed the team 2,300 yuan. No wonder his wooden face was always "cloudy with a chance of rain."

The difficult meeting ended, and in Dai Yongchang's mind appeared a picture of such tragic poverty: villagers with an average income of only 97 yuan had once owned a 12-horsepower diesel engine and a water pump. After the responsibility system, the only two machines in the village were sold for 300 yuan. Now, what belonged to the collective property was only three dilapidated straw houses used as classrooms for children. In addition, there was not a single stick or brick left in the village's account.

Dai Yongchang discussed with Chen Guolin to meet everyone and say a few words. Soon, people began to gather here. About 50 households and 200 people almost all came! It was not so much that people came to listen to the speech as to see the novelty, to see what the soldiers looked like. Facing 400 pairs of eyes, Dai Yongchang took three steps and two steps up a small hill, opened his mouth, and said, "Fellow villagers, our military sub-district is entrusted by the district committee and the district government to help everyone get out of poverty! Let's start today to challenge poverty and ignorance together!" He spoke more and more excitedly, waving his strong arms, his deep voice like rolling thunder, the momentum not inferior to the heroic spirit of participating in the great battle.

The hardened land gradually began to loosen up...

Dai Yongchang found active powder in the inert soil, poured it into his own burning chest, and forged a huge support for the rusted wheel, so it rolled...

When the district held a meeting to help the poor, 22 poor villages were listed. The leaders of the military sub-district estimated that the superiors might allow them to take a village like "Erlu" with relatively good conditions. Unexpectedly, when it was announced, the military sub-district was paired with the poorest "Xinsheng." At that time, the military sub-district leaders present immediately broke out in a fine sweat, feeling as if they had a mountain of ten thousand feet on their shoulders. They wanted to propose it to the superiors several times, but looking at their uniforms, they swallowed the words that had risen to their throats.

Dai Yongchang came to Xinsheng Village again. He found that the people in the village had nothing to do. Except for the elderly who liked to gather to chat, the young men also sat with their sleeves rolled up, grinding their teeth against the south wall, and could sit for half a day. Time slowly passed in their idle chatter.

Dai Yongchang saw this and was indeed a bit angry. Now, what was the world outside like? Here, it was still stagnant in the inertia of small-scale production. Before Hekou District was established, this place was at the junction of three counties: Zhanhua, Lijin, and Kenli, a place where no one was in charge. Long-term lawlessness and lack of information had cultivated their inertia, conservative ideas, and bad habits. The wind of reform in the countryside blew in, strong or weak, but they turned a deaf ear. Before the military sub-district entered the village, the entire village had only one woman who collected empty bottles. This woman, who opened the first business in the village, hid and hid every day, fearing that the villagers would know what she was doing.

To solve the villagers' food problem, Dai Yongchang and the comrades of the military sub-district carefully analyzed the situation in Xinsheng Village and decided to take the first step in poverty alleviation. In spring, when every household was short of food, 57 households in the village had already run out of food. With empty stomachs, they couldn't straighten their backs, and they all looked like they had rickets.

Dai Yongchang gathered the young men to discuss ways to get rich. He inspired them, saying, "Elsewhere, young people do sideline work, trade, and small businesses, and they all get rich. They build new houses and eat white steamed buns. Let's not let our hands be idle."

One said, "Our place is too poor, with no foundation at all. Whatever business we do, we might lose money."

Another said, "Corn and beans are easy to eat. White steamed buns stick to your mouth. What's the point? Now the days are good enough. How can they be any better?"

Different ideas led to different ways of thinking. In a short conversation, Dai Yongchang found that the gap between his thoughts and theirs was too great. But he did not lose heart and continued to talk to them about the world outside and the paths to wealth. Some young men were moved and enlightened.

When Dai Yongchang mentioned that 5,000 acres of wasteland was a natural pasture and could develop animal husbandry, a young man surnamed Li suddenly remembered a relative in a pasture in Northeast China who could buy cheap cows. Dai Yongchang heard this and slapped his thigh, saying, "Good, write a letter to your relative immediately and bring thirty or fifty head here..."

That day, Dai Yongchang ran to the district agricultural bank and borrowed 13,000 yuan, plus 5,000 yuan from the labor-for-defense fund, to buy cows.

"Beep, beep..." A clear car horn woke the villagers from their dreams. They turned over on the kang, lifted the paper covering the window, and saw that the truck from Northeast China had entered the village.

"Fellow villagers!" Dai Yongchang stood on the truck and shouted, "The cows have been bought. You don't need to pay for them first. They are lent to you to raise..." Before Dai Yongchang's words had landed, the impatient villagers rushed to the more than 50 head of fine yellow cattle. Like a store selling scarce goods, or like girls choosing their favorite fabric, they looked from top to bottom, from head to tail, and after looking at one, they didn't want to let go of the rope, and their eyes were dazzled. Finally, they led away the cattle they had chosen, and from afar, they still looked back at the cattle they had chosen, reluctant to part with them. Some even wiped their tears with their sleeves while leading the cattle...

Taking advantage of the high morale of the masses, the military sub-district also bought more than 300 fine-wool sheep and distributed them to each household. For a while, the long-silent Xinsheng Village became lively. They all led cows and herded sheep out of the village, heading towards the fields that nurtured the hopes of farmers.

The rusted wheel of Xinsheng Village finally rolled...

Dai Yongchang had a spring full of hope in his heart and an autumn full of harvest. Just as the people of Xinsheng were immersed in joy, another poverty alleviation plan—planting rice—like a full seed, was germinating in his artificial pistil.

"What? Planting rice?" The villagers were surprised, puzzled, suspicious, and confused, looking at the man in front of them with a pair of almost distrustful eyes, as if saying, "Have you forgotten the history of this place?"

The impact, promotion, and pressure of society left deep marks on Dai Yongchang's soul. When he was nine years old, his grandfather used a creaking cart to come from his hometown in Liangshan to a place not far from here. (He still remembered clearly that the place was called the Disaster House at that time.) 900 miles, it took half a month. When they arrived, they unloaded the cart and dug a hole in the ground, half-shaded, half-sunny, eating and living in this ear-sized home. At that time, the land here was still fertile, and planting corn would grow. After the harvest, they would bring the grain and push a cart of salt back to their hometown. The next spring, they would come back here. Year after year, like migratory birds, they repeated this cycle. One summer, the sea roared like a lion and came rushing in. From then on, this place became a barren, white, saline-alkali land...

Childhood memories were bitter, but they also made Dai Yongchang more attached to this land. He firmly believed that as long as the water problem and the "washing of the land" problem were solved, this land could be used to plant rice.

The wind blew. The cold wind howled on the unprotected grasslands, chasing each other on the marshes, announcing the arrival of winter. The water diversion project for irrigating rice fields was started on this cold and windy day, which was undoubtedly a coincidence.

The whistle of Zhang, the political commissar of the military sub-district, blew, and ten people lined up in the blink of an eye. Everyone's expression was so serious, like a farewell before a battle. The difference was that they had no guns or bullets, each with a military water bottle on their shoulders and two steamed buns in their arms, striding towards the wasteland, joining the army of digging canals. After a winter of hard work, they finally dug a canal 2,000 meters long, bringing the sweet water from the Yongfeng River.

Just as the time for transplanting rice came, 5,000 acres of wasteland had not been tilled. But Dai Yongchang suddenly disappeared. The female party branch secretary, Yan Changyu, was so anxious that she sent people to look for him everywhere, for one day, two days... For seven or eight days, there was no sign of him. Yan Changyu was pacing back and forth in the house when Dai Yongchang suddenly appeared in front of her, as if he had emerged from the ground.

"Ah, these days have really worried people to death!" Yan Changyu said, slapping her thigh.

Dai Yongchang did not speak, but only smiled mysteriously.

"Have you forgotten about changing the rice?" Yan Changyu asked reproachfully.

"Of course not!" Dai Yongchang answered firmly.

"How will the rice change be done?" Yan Changyu's tone became serious.

"Yan Secretary, come out and see." Dai Yongchang said, walking out the door and pointing to a large tractor at the head of the village, saying, "I have already contacted the Shengli Oilfield. The oil workers will send a car to help us till the land! This big guy will eat the land like a game!"

It turned out that in the past two days, Dai Yongchang had rushed into the office of the Pipe Company of the Drilling Company of the Shengli Oilfield to seek help from the oil brothers. The "negotiation" was very smooth, and both sides, based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, agreed that the Xinsheng Village would organize a labor service team to go to the oilfield for labor export; the oilfield would support Xinsheng in changing the rice, providing 1,000 meters of windproof and rainproof lines, 4 concrete power poles, two sets of distribution panels, one prefabricated house, and a large horsepower tractor to plow the land, plus one water station technician...

The speaker was excited, and the listener was deeply moved.

"Come on, let's go to the slope to see the plowing!" Dai Yongchang shouted, and the villagers, as if waking from a dream, rushed to the tractor.

In Dai Yongchang's memory, there were still such scenes: his father's generation, with a shoulder pole, dragging a heavy plow, bending their backs, struggling on the ground... But all these were faded pictures.

"Beep..." With the whistle of the oil brothers, the tractor's solemn body began to move, plowing the oldest and youngest land of the Republic...

The tractor rumbled in the slope for six days, opening up 280 acres of wasteland. The military sub-district helped the villagers buy several varieties of rice, including "Nongken 57," "8911," and hybrid rice, a total of more than 2,000 trays. They unloaded the rice seedlings from the car and, without catching their breath, rolled up their pants and jumped into the rice fields...

Red willow, a shrub that grows on the wasteland. It is salt-tolerant, wind-resistant, and can bloom and grow in extremely harsh conditions... In the eyes of the people of Xinsheng, a kind of willow similar to the red willow appeared here again. The difference was that under special photosynthesis, they showed green.

Last autumn, the oilfield gave Xinsheng Village 20,000 yuan for land acquisition. Those who had never seen so much money did not know how to use it. Someone shouted, "Let's divide the money and buy something good!"

Facing the 20,000 yuan, the first word that popped into Dai Yongchang's mind was: electricity! Several years ago, during his first visit to the village, Dai Yongchang had witnessed a harsh reality: in the six villages of Liuhe Township, almost every village had electricity, but the kang in Xinsheng people's homes still had the ancient oil lamp bowl. Dai Yongchang, who was not very imaginative, often had such a dream: every household in Xinsheng used electric lights, watched TV, and used electric fans; at the head of the village, the high-speed rotating electric machine sang...

Poverty, time and time again, ruthlessly shattered his beautiful dreams.

On New Year's Day 1989, the people of Xinsheng, who usually did not celebrate the New Year, spent an unforgettable sleepless night on this night...

When the lights in every household lit up at the same time, it meant that the people of Xinsheng would forever say goodbye to darkness.

At first, they squinted at this glowing thing, then looked at the bright surroundings, and could not help but rejoice: "It's bright! It's bright! We are bright!" Even the elderly jumped like children. People eagerly smashed the oil lamp bowls that had accompanied them for so many years.

Cui Xuelan, a 90-year-old woman, was the oldest person in the village and could be called a living fossil. This old woman, born in the last century, had experienced several dynasties and societies. She never imagined that in the last leg of her life, there would be light...

He and Zhang, the political commissar of the military sub-district, agreed and then invited Zhou Qing, the director of the district people's congress who was familiar with electricity, as a consultant. Then, with the courage and wisdom of a soldier, he began to deal with that ever-changing, fickle, and devil-like thing—electricity.

Dai Yongchang, who had entered his forties, participated in the higher self-study examination. He was familiar with the principles of Marxism-Leninism, but he knew nothing about the principles of electricity. He decided to start from scratch. This time, the study did not start from books but from practice: surveying the terrain, the direction of the line, the setting of the transformer, the position of the water station... The distance from the power source to the village was seven miles. Dai Yongchang walked back and forth like flying a kite, four or five times in one breath.

The required materials, materials, and labor hours were counted, and when they were pressed on the small calculator, wow, 60,000 yuan. Everyone present scratched their heads. As for these soldiers who ate military rations, it was harder to get 60,000 yuan than to "patch the sky"?

Dai Yongchang sought help from the "oil brothers" again.

This time, the target of the attack was the Oil Construction Second Division. He used the tactic of "concentrating on key points and attacking one by one," visiting the division's secretary, commander, production office director, energy conservation department director, water and electricity team leader, power supply team leader... everyone related to wiring, like a revolving door. Finally, an agreement was reached to exchange the labor output of Xinsheng Village for the electrical equipment of the oilfield.

Xinsheng Village had electricity, and good news came one after another like grapes on a vine in August: yesterday, Han Yiwu's slaughterhouse opened; today, Gao Jinhai's electric mill started; tomorrow, Wang Zhixin's motorcycle repair shop was established...

Three years passed in the blink of an eye. In more than a thousand sunrises and sunsets, the soldiers of the military sub-district led the farmers to overcome floods, droughts, sandstorms, hail, frost, and tides, turning Xinsheng into green...

This was done with more than 1,000 green calendar cards! On each calendar card, their green life was condensed. They sprinkled the green leaf pigment that should belong to them on this barren and desolate land, and their aging was ahead of time. Dai Yongchang's originally black hair had turned white, his strong back was slightly bent, and his fair skin had become rough and dark... In the eyes of the people of Xinsheng, Zhang, the political commissar, Dai, the head of the department, Liu, the head of the section, and Zhang, the head of the section, these heroes, were like the clusters of red willows growing on the banks of the Yellow River, full of tenacious vitality...

    荒滩绿柳
    彭雁华
    他们进村了。只有两个人的队伍，却给一首苍凉而发了黄的古老民谣里，平添两个绿色的音符。
    黄河的尾端有一个小村庄，也许因为它太小、太荒，也许因为它太偏、太穷，一直没有名字。解放前，一个大地主雇工在此放牧，打这起，人们叫它牧羊工场。解放了，过了好多年以后，村里有位识字的人才给它取了个名——新胜。“新胜”这名字虽说响亮、好听，可村子依旧是太小、太荒、太穷。可能是它坐落于黄河故道的缘故吧，新胜的全部荒漠、孤寂、贫困情景仅用一个字便可代替——黄：他们生长在黄土地，住着黄土屋，嚼的是黄须菜，喝的是黄汤水，饥饿的脸色像黄表纸，死后埋入黄埃，总之，这里人们的命比黄连还苦。
    黄！黄！黄！难道新胜人的黄历上永远是这个充满着饥饿与贫困的字眼吗？！
    1986年的春天，共和国辽远的大地上已是万木葳蕤，千山蓊郁。然而，这里的土地仍在昏睡……
    黄沙飞旋的一天，破晓的鸡刚叫头遍，新胜村的村东南角传来了一阵阵不寻常的脚步声，惊扰了这里的古老，惊醒了人们的梦。
    脚步声顿住了，人们才惊异发现这是一支只有两个人的队伍。走在前面的是一个阔脸大汉。没见过世面的村童们跟在这两个着绿装人的屁股后面，惊喜地像一群小鸟叽叽喳喳，不时地喊着：“解放军？解放军来啦！……”
    这位阔脸，腮上长着一把又黑又粗的大胡子的汉子叫戴永昌，是东营市河口区人武部部长，另一位是人武部政工科科长，叫张宝金。他们一踏进村子，两双贪婪的眸子，从村头看到庄尾，从场院扫到小河旁，他们在残破的石磨前驻足，在低矮的土屋里凝眸。他们流动的身影，仿佛两团绿色的云，飘来飘去，在老人们的眼里恍惚童年记忆中的绿色田园。阔别已久的春天真的降到了新胜这块荒原了吗？老人们揉着惺忪的眼睛看着这两位绿色的使者。
    太阳升到一杆子高了，他们一前一后走进了当时的村党支部书记陈国林的家。陈书记家仅有三间又矮又破的小土屋，屋子里空空荡荡，黑咕隆咚，咋一进屋啥也看不清，浓烈的霉气味直刺鼻子，只听到一群耗子正在那墙角上扑愣愣地直闹腾呢。
    “屋里窄吧，到院子里啦呱吧。”三个人仅有两只小杌子，另一个只好屁股底下垫一块土坯。他们的谈话有些尬尴，陈国林那迟缓憨呆的样子叫人着急，你问一句，他答一句，你不问，他半天也不哼一声。也许人们还不知道，陈国林除了15年支书生涯没得到一分钱的报酬外，还欠着队里2300元的债呢。难怪他那木讷的脸上老是“多云转阴”。
    艰难的座谈结束了，戴永昌的眼前浮现出一幅多么令人悲伤的贫困图呀：人均收入只有97元的村民们，历史上曾拥有过一台12马力的柴油机和一台水泵，承包责任制后，村里唯有的二台机器被变卖了300元钱，现在属于集体财产的，只有三间给孩子们当了课堂的破草房。此外，村里的账单上再没有一根木棍，一块砖头。
    戴永昌与陈国林商量着，给大家伙见个面，讲几句话。不一会，人们纷纷朝这里聚拢，50来户，200多人差不多都到齐啦！与其说是人们来听讲话，不如说是来看新鲜，看看解放军是个啥样。面对400多只眼睛，戴永昌三步二步登上个土坡，亮开大嗓门说：“乡亲们，俺们人武部是受区委、区政府的委托，帮助大伙脱贫来啦！让咱们从今天起，一起向贫穷、愚昧挑战吧！……”他越讲越激动，挥舞着粗壮的胳膊，深厚的嗓音像滚动的雷声，那劲头，不亚于当年参加大战役的雄风。
    这块板结的土地渐渐开始松动了……
    戴永昌在惰性的土壤里淘出活性的粉末，投进自己火热的胸膛，给锈蚀的巨轮冶炼出一个硕大的支架，于是，它隆隆滚动了……
    区里开会扶贫的时候，排了22个贫困村。人武部的领导估摸着，上级许是能让咱包个像“二吕”这样条件不太差的村。没想到一宣布，让人武部与最贫困的“新胜”结成对子。当时，在场的人武部领导们立时头上冒出了一层细细的汗珠，双肩有压上万仞高山之感。几次想给上级提出来，但看了看身上的军装，把送到喉咙里的话又压了下去。
    戴永昌又一次来到新胜村。他发现，村里的人无所事事。除了上了年纪的人爱凑在一起拉呱外，小伙子们也都一个个袖着手，蹲在南墙跟磨牙，一泡就是半天。时间呀，就在他们的闲聊中慢慢地走开了。
    戴永昌看到这些着实有几分愠怒；现在外面的世界都变成啥样子了，这里还停滞在小生产者一种因习的惯性里。没成立河口区以前，这里位于沾化、利津、垦利三县交界之处，为三不管村。长期的无政府状态和信息闭塞，养成了他们惰性习惯，保守观念，积习难改。外面农村改革之风若强若弱地刮进来，他们充耳不闻，人武部进村前，全村只有一个收酒瓶子的妇女。这位村里开商品经济先河的巾帼人物，日日早出晚归、躲躲藏藏唯恐本村人知道自己在干什么。
    为解决村民的吃饭问题，戴永昌同人武部的同志仔细分析了新胜村的情况后，决定走出扶贫的第一步。春天里，正是家家户户粮食青黄不接的时候，全村57户人家，已有不少人家穷的揭不开锅了。肚子填不饱，腰也直不起来，一个个像得了佝偻病。　　戴永昌把小伙子们集中起来商量着致富的办法。他启发说：“别处的小青年搞副业、经商、作小买卖，都富了，他们盖新房，吃白馍馍，咱们也别让手闲着。”
    一个说：“咱这地方太穷，一点家底没有，干啥营生也是担挣不担赔。”
    另一个说：“高粱、豆子吃起来多利索，白面馍馍塞到嘴里粘乎乎的啥意思，现在这日子过得挺赛啦，再好还能咋个好法？”
    观念的不同导致了思维方式的不同。短短的几句交谈，戴永昌发现他与他们之间思想上的距离太大了。但他并不灰心，继续和他们谈外面的世界，谈致富的门路。到底有些小伙子动心了，开窍了。
    当戴永昌说到5000亩荒地是一块天然牧场，可以发展畜牧业的时候，一个姓李的小伙子突然想起自己一个亲戚在东北一个牧场，能买到便宜牛。戴永昌一听，“啪”地一声拍了一下自己的大腿说：“好，马上给你亲戚写封信，拉它三十五十头来……”
    当天，戴永昌就跑到区农行贷了13000元的款，又拿出以劳养武费5000元，作为买牛之用。
    “嘟嘟——”一阵清脆的汽车喇叭声把乡亲们从梦中惊醒。他们从炕上翻了个身，揭起窗格子上的道林纸一看，才知是东北送牛的大卡车进村啦。
    “乡亲们！”戴永昌站在卡车上喊，“牛买来了，先不用交钱，贷给大家养……”呼啦一声，戴永昌的话还没落地，早就等不急的人们朝50多头良种大黄牛扑了过去。像是商店里抢购紧俏商品，又像是姑娘们在挑先自己喜爱的花布，一头一头地像过筛子一样，从上看到下，从头摸到尾，看着这头也不错，拉着哪根绳头也不想松，把眼都挑花了。最后，他们把选定的牲口牵走了，远远地，还两步三回头，恋恋不舍地瞅着。有的一边牵着牛，一边还用衣角抹着泪……
    趁着群众的高涨情绪，人武部又买来300多只细毛羊分到各家各户。一时间，沉寂了多年的新胜村热闹起来了，他们纷纷牵着牛，赶着羊走出了村子，走向孕育农民希望的田野。
    新胜村这只锈蚀的车轮终于滚动了……
    戴永昌心里有一个充满希望的春天，也有一个充满收获的秋季。正当新胜人沉浸在一片欢乐之中时，另一个扶贫计划——种水稻，像一颗饱满的种子，在他那人工花蕊里孕育成熟。
    “什么？种水稻？”乡亲们惊愕、诧异、狐疑、困惑，用一种近乎不信任的眸子望着眼前这位没有三头六臂只有一身普通绿军装的汉子，仿佛在说：你忘记了这儿演变的历史？
    社会的冲撞、升迁、挤压，给戴永昌的心灵上留下了深深的印痕。他九岁那年，爷爷用吱吱呀呀唱的小车，从老家梁山来到离这儿不远的地方。（他还清楚地记得，当年那地方叫灾民屋子）900多里路，走了整整半个月。到了地方卸下车来，就地挖个地窝子，半阴半阳，吃住都在这个耳朵眼子大的家里。那年头，这里的地还肥，点上棒子就长。秋后带上收获的粮食，推上一车盐，返回老家。来年春天，再来到这里。一年一年周而复始，像迁徙的候鸟。有一年的夏天，大海狂狮般地扑了过来。从此，这里成了光秃秃、白花花的盐碱地……
    童年的回忆是苦涩的，也使戴永昌对这儿的土地增加了几分眷恋。他坚信，只要解决水的问题和“洗田”问题，这块土地是能够种水稻的。
    起风了。寒冷的风在无遮无挡的大草甸子上嘶叫着，在沼泽地上互相追赶着，宣告着冬天的来临。引水灌溉稻田的水渠修筑工程，选在这个寒风凛烈的日子里，无疑是一种偶然的巧合。
    人武部张政委衔在嘴里的小哨子一吹，十个人眨眼工夫排好队。每个人的表情都那么严峻，像出征前的壮行。所不同的是，他们身上没有一枪一弹，各自肩背一只军用水壶，怀里揣着两个馍馍，雄赳赳地向荒滩进发了，汇合到开渠大军里。一冬的苦战，终于变出来一条长2000多米的水渠，引来了永丰河清凌凌的甘露水。
    眼看到了稻子插秧时节，5000亩荒地一块没整。而戴永昌却突然失踪了。急得村里的女支书冉常玉派人四处寻找，一天、两天……一连七八天，不见他的影子。冉常玉正在屋子里急得打转转时，戴永昌却像从地里冒出来似的，突然出现在她面前。
    “哎呀呀，这几天可把人急坏啦！”冉书记拍着腿说。
    戴永昌不吱声，只是诡秘地笑笑。
    “把稻改的事忘啦？”冉书记嗔怪地问。
    “哪能呐！”戴永昌肯定地答。
    “那稻改咋办？”冉书记的口气严肃起来了。
    “冉书记，你出来看。”戴永昌边说，边走出门来，指着村头一辆大型的拖拉机说：“我已和胜利油田联系好了。石油工人派车帮着咱们整地来啦！这大家伙啃起地皮来还不跟玩似的？”
    原来，那两天戴永昌闯进胜利油田钻井总公司管子公司的办公室，到石油老大哥那里求援去了。“谈判”非常顺利，双方本着互相帮助，互惠互利的原则，由新胜村组织一支劳务队伍到油田搞劳务输出；油田支援新胜搞稻改，无偿地援助1000米风雨线，4根水泥电线杆子，两套配电盘，一幢活动板房，还调出一台大马力拖拉机犁地，外带一名扬水站技术员……
    讲者眉飞色舞，听者入神如痴。
    走，到坡里看犁地的去！”戴永昌一吆喝，乡亲们才方如梦醒，“忽啦啦”拥到拖拉机周围。
    在戴永昌的记忆里，还叠映着这样的场面：父辈们肩上搭着车袢，拖着沉重的犁，弓着脊背在地上艰难地跋涉……然而，这都属于一幅幅褪了色的画了。
    “嘟——”，随着石油大哥的哨子一吹，拖拉机那庄严的身躯开始前进，犁开了共和国这片最古老又最年轻的土地……
    拖拉机突突突地在坡里跑了六天，开出了280亩荒地。人武部帮着乡亲们买来“农垦57”“8911”和杂交稻几个水稻品种，总共两千多盘，从车上卸下稻苗，还未来得及喘口气，他们又挽起裤腿，跳进了稻田……
      红柳，荒滩上生长的一种灌木。它耐盐碱，抗风沙，能够在极恶劣的条件下扬花拔节……在新胜人的眼里，这里又出现了近似红柳的一种柳，所不同的是，在特殊的光合作用下，它们呈现出绿的颜色。
    去年秋上，油田征地给了新胜村二万元的占地款。没见过大钱的人也不会用钱。有人喊着：“把钱分了吧，买点什么东西不好？”
    面对这二万元，戴永昌的脑子里首先迸出一个字：电！几年前的第一次进村，戴永昌就亲眼看到了一个严酷的现实：六合乡28个村，基本上村村都通上电了，而新胜人的炕头上，仍然摆着古老的油灯碗。从小不太爱幻想的戴永昌，常常做出这样的梦：新胜村家家户户用上了电灯，看上了电视机，使上了电风扇；村头，高速运转的电机在欢唱……贫穷，一次次无情地摧垮了他的美梦。
    1989年元旦，一向不过新年的新胜人，却在这天晚上度过了一个终生难忘的不眠之夜……
    当家家户户的电灯在一瞬间同时燃亮时，意味着新胜人将永久地与黑暗告别了。
    起初，他们眯起眼睛盯着这个发光的东西，继而看看亮堂堂的四周，禁不住狂欢起来：“明啦！明啦！咱们明啦！”上了年纪的人也像小孩似地跳了起来。人们使劲地摔碎了伴随了自己多少年的油灯碗。
    90岁的崔学兰大娘，是全村年岁最高的老人，可堪称得是一块活化石。这位上个世纪出生的老人，经历了几个朝代、几个社会，她万万想不到，在自己人生最后一程道路上，有了光明……
    他与人武部的张政委商定后，便聘请了熟悉电力的区人大主任周庆成为顾问，尔后，他以一个军人的果敢和智慧，开始了同那个变幻多端，喜怒无常，形似魔鬼般的东西——电打上了交道。
    进入不惑之年的戴永昌，参加了高等自学考试，他熟悉马列主义哲学原理，但对电力原理却一窍不通。从头自学吧，他暗下决心。这次学习不是从书本上开始，而是从实践中开始的：勘察地形、线路走向，变压器的设置，扬水站的方位，……从电源到村里的距离是七里，戴永昌像放风筝似的，一口气来回走了四五趟。
    所需的物资、材料、工时统计上来了，搁到小计算器上一揿，嚯，6万挂零。在场的人都搔头了，作为这些吃军费的大兵来说，搞到6万块钱比“补天”还难呢？
    戴永昌再一次求援于“石油大哥”了。
    这回进攻的目标是油建二部。他使用了“重点包围，各个击破”的战术，把二部的书记、指挥、生产办主任、节能科科长、水电大队队长、供电队队长……凡与架线有关的人，走马灯似地走了个遍。终于达成了用新胜村的劳务输出来换油田的电器的协议。
    新胜村通上了电，喜事像八月里架子上的葡萄，一串接着一串：昨天，韩曰武的屠宰厂开张；今天，高金海电磨房试机；明天，王志信的摩托车修理厂成立……
    一晃三年过去了，在周而复始的一千多个日出日落中，人武部的战士们带领农民战胜了洪涝、干旱、风沙、冰雹、霜冻、海潮……使新胜变成了绿色……
    这是1000多张绿色的日历卡铺出来的呀！在每一张日历卡上，都浓缩着他们绿色的生命。他们把应该属于自己的绿叶色素洒在了这块贫瘠而荒漠的土地，自己的衰老却走在了岁月的前面。戴永昌原来那一头的乌发花白了，硬朗的腰板微微弯曲，白皙皙的皮肤变得粗糙黝黑……在新胜人的眼里，张政委、戴部长、刘科长、张科长这些好汉，多像生长在黄河岸边的那一簇簇具有顽强生命力的红柳……
