Beijing's water supply is facing a critical situation. The municipal government has decided to take emergency measures.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on October 13th, a reporter learned from the Beijing Municipal Government's executive meeting today: Although it has been rainy since the autumn, the water shortage situation in Beijing is still very severe. Reservoir water storage has decreased, and the groundwater level has dropped. Solving the water crisis in the capital is urgent.

From January to September this year, Beijing's average rainfall was 411.5 millimeters, which is 80% of the same period last year. The two major surface water sources in Beijing, Miyun and Guanting reservoirs, had 40% less rainfall in their upstream areas during the flood season compared to the same period last year, resulting in a significant reduction in water storage this year. It is estimated that by next January, the water level in the Guanting Reservoir may drop below the dead water level.

The Beijing Municipal People's Government attaches great importance to this issue. After research and discussion, it has been decided that the city will vigorously promote water-saving activities and strictly implement planned water use in all sectors. At the same time, the municipal government will take two measures this winter: changing the water supply for urban areas to be provided by the Miyun Reservoir through the Jingmi Canal and immediately starting the construction of the second water source project in the western part of Beijing, to alleviate the water shortage problem in Beijing.

    北京水源呈危机态势
    市政府决定采取应急措施
    据新华社北京10月13日电（记者邱永生）记者今日从北京市政府常务会议上获悉：尽管入秋以来北京曾一度阴雨连绵，但水源紧缺的形势仍很严重，水库蓄水减少，地下水位下降，解决首都水源危机的问题已迫在眉睫。
    今年1至9月，北京平均降雨411.5毫米，为往年同期雨量的80％。北京的主要地上水源密云、官厅两大水库上游，汛期降雨都比去年同期减少40％左右，造成今年以来蓄水量大减。预计到明年1月官厅水库水位可能降至死水位以下。
    北京市人民政府对此极为重视，经研究决定，全市将大力开展节水活动，在各行各业严格实行计划用水。同时，市府还采取今年冬季，将城区用水改由密云水库通过京密引水渠供水和立即上马建设京西第二水源工程等两项措施，以缓解北京水资源紧缺问题。
