After the rain, everything seemed fresh and clean. The sky above Chengdu's Taiping Temple Airport was dotted with colorful parachutes as the women's precision parachuting competition was in full swing.

In the previous six rounds, the Soviet Union's Olga and China's Lai Xiaoli both led with a score of 0.01 meters, while the Soviet Union's Natacha trailed closely behind with 0.02 meters. China's Zhang Hongyan was in fourth place with 0.04 meters. Today's gold medal contest was essentially a battle between the Chinese and Soviet teams. The situation on the field was changing rapidly. In the seventh round, both Olga from the Soviet Union and Zhang Hongyan from China scored 0.02 meters. Olga dropped to third place, while Zhang Hongyan remained in fourth. In the crucial tenth round, both Olga and Zhang Hongyan scored 0.00 meters, placing them in second and third positions, respectively.

At this moment, everyone's attention turned to the last athlete in the sky, Lai Xiaoli. Making her debut in a major international competition, the petite Lai Xiaoli performed exceptionally well today, hitting the bullseye in the seventh, eighth, and ninth rounds. Could she hit the bullseye in the final round? Athletes, coaches, and spectators anxiously watched the sky.

Lai Xiaoli descended steadily. When the parachute was about 100 meters above the ground, she successfully positioned herself and then slowly descended, landing precisely on the target. The electronic scoreboard immediately displayed a score of 0.00 meters. "She hit the target!" Lai Xiaoli finally realized her dream.

    激动人心的一跳
    ——记赖晓莉勇夺金牌
    雨后放晴，处处显得清新。成都太平寺机场上空彩伞朵朵，女子定点跳伞比赛正在紧张进行。
    在前几天进行的前6轮比赛中，苏联的奥尔戈和中国的赖晓莉均以0.01米并列领先，苏联的娜苔佳以0.02米紧随她们之后，中国的张红雁以0.04米排列第4。今天这个项目的金牌之争，实际上是中苏两队之争。赛场瞬息万变。苏联的奥尔戈和中国的张红雁第7轮时均跳个0.02米，奥尔戈一下跌到第3位，张红雁仍居第4。在关键的第10轮，奥尔戈和张红雁均跳出0.00米的好成绩，位居第二和第三。
    这时，大家的目光自然地注视着空中的最后一名运动员赖晓莉。首次参加世界大赛、身材小巧的赖晓莉今天发挥得很出色，在七、八、九3轮中均踩中靶心。在最后一轮中能否踩中靶心？运动员、教练员和观众们焦虑地注视着上空。
    只见赖晓莉平稳下降，当降落伞降到离地面100米左右顺利定位，然后徐徐下落、踩点，电子计分牌上立即显示出0.00米的记号。“中靶了！”赖晓莉终于实现了愿望。
