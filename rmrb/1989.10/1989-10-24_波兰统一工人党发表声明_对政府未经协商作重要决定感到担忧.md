The Polish United Workers' Party has issued a statement expressing concern over the Mazowiecki government's making or planning to make important decisions without consulting relevant social forces. The statement emphasizes that major issues affecting the national economy and people's livelihoods should be agreed upon with various social forces.

The above stance of the Polish United Workers' Party was mentioned in a statement by the party's central spokesperson. The *People's Tribune* published this statement on October 20.

In recent years, one of the significant achievements in Poland's democratization process has been the consultation and agreement between the government and various parties and social organizations on major issues that affect the country's future and people's lives. During the roundtable talks held in February to April this year, representatives of various political and social forces, particularly the Solidarity Trade Union, repeatedly stressed the importance of maintaining and promoting this achievement. They argued that economic reforms in Poland would not succeed without the participation and support of society, and that political reforms would be mere empty talk.

Half a year later, the situation in Poland has changed, and the Solidarity Trade Union has formed the government. However, various political and social forces still believe it is necessary to adhere to the principle of negotiation and consultation.

The spokesperson for the Polish United Workers' Party's central committee pointed out in the statement that measures such as the free-market economy plan, privatization of national assets, and allowing unemployment, which are closely related to every Polish family, "cannot be implemented without the approval of society and an agreement with the workers."

The statement said that the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party supports the proposal by the National Trade Union Alliance (established at the end of 1981 after martial law was imposed in Poland, currently with about 6 million members) for the government and worker representatives to negotiate and sign relevant agreements on the above issues.

　　波兰统一工人党发表声明
　　对政府未经协商作重要决定感到担忧
    新华社华沙10月21日电　（记者汤德乔）波兰统一工人党中央日前发表声明，对马佐维耶茨基政府在未与有关社会力量磋商的情况下已经或将要作出重要决定一事“感到担忧”，认为有关国计民生的重大问题政府“应与各社会力量达成协议”。
    波兰统一工人党的上述立场是波党中央发言人的声明中提及的。《人民论坛报》10月20日刊登了这项声明。
    在重大的、涉及到国家前途和人民生活的问题上，政府和各党派、社会团体进行协商，从而达成协议——这被认为是近几年来波兰民主化进程中取得的一大成果。在今年2—4月份举行的圆桌会议上，各政治、社会力量代表，特别是团结工会代表多次强调要维护并发扬这一成果，说没有社会的参与和赞同波兰经济改革是不会成功的，政治改革也不过是纸上谈兵而已。半年后，波国内形势发生了变化，团结工会组成了政府。然而，各政治、社会力量仍认为有必要坚持谈判协商原则。
    波兰统一工人党中央发言人在声明中指出，如今与每个波兰家庭关系密切的自由市场经济方案、全民财产私有化和允许失业等措施
  “如果没有获得社会的赞同和与劳动者达成协议的话，是无法落实的”。
    声明说，统一工人党中央委员会支持波兰工会全国协议会（波兰1981年底实行军管后成立，现拥有约600万会员）提出的关于政府和职工代表就上述问题进行谈判并签订相应协议的建议。
