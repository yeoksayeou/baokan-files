Domestic cosmetics can meet the needs of all levels
The quality of most products is not lower than international advanced levels

According to a report by our reporter Liu Guilian: With a wide range of categories and numerous varieties, China's cosmetic products are developing towards high-end and series-based products, fully capable of meeting the needs of domestic consumers at various levels. This is what the responsible person of the China Cosmetics Industry Association recently told our reporter.

The cosmetics industry in China is both ancient and emerging. In recent years, through the renovation of old enterprises and the introduction of advanced foreign equipment and technological exchanges, China's cosmetics industry has entered a new development period. The output value of cosmetics has increased from 400 million yuan in 1980 to 1.8 billion yuan in 1988. The number of product varieties has reached more than 1,000, with export earnings of approximately 50 million US dollars. The product structure has shifted from single low-end products such as cold cream and eau de cologne to a variety of series-based products, forming various skincare cosmetics, hair care cosmetics, and beauty products suitable for different skin types and local climates for the elderly, youth, and children. Some cosmetics developed using natural resources have been well-received by foreign consumers.

Among Chinese consumers, there are a few who always think that foreign cosmetics are better. An authoritative person from the Cosmetics Association said that in fact, most imported cosmetics have not undergone quality analysis and testing. Some imported cosmetics are of poor quality and high price, and some even contain additives that should not be present.

Domestic cosmetics may not be as good as imported cosmetics in terms of packaging and fragrance, but the internal quality of most products is not lower than international advanced levels.

    国产化妆品可满足各层次需要
    多数产品内在质量不低于国际先进水平
    本报讯　记者刘桂莲报道：门类齐全，品种繁多，正在向高档化、系列化发展的我国化妆产品，完全可以满足国内各层次消费者的需要。这是我国化妆品生产协会负责人日前向记者介绍的。
    化妆品行业在我国是古老的，也是新兴的。近年来，通过对老企业的改造和引进国外先进设备及技术交流，我国化妆品工业已进入新的发展时期。化妆品产值由1980年的4亿元，提高到1988年的18亿元，产品品种达1000多种，出口创汇约5000万美元。产品结构已从单一的雪花膏、花露水的低档产品向多品种、系列化发展，已形成适于各种皮肤和各地气候的老年人、青年人及儿童用的各种护肤化妆品、发用化妆品和美容类产品。一些利用天然资源研制成功的化妆品，深受国外消费者欢迎。
    在我国消费者中，有少数人总以为外国化妆品都好。化妆品协会权威人士说，其实，进口化妆品大都未经过质量分析检测，有些进口化妆品质次价高，内中还有不应有的添加物。
    国产化妆品在包装、香型上不如进口化妆品，但内在质量多数产品不低于国际先进水平。
