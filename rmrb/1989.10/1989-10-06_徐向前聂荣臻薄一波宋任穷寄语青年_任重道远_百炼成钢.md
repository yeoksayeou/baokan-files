The upcoming issue of *China Youth* (October issue) will feature messages from Xu Xiangxian, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, and Song Renqing to the younger generation on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Marshal Xu Xiangxian's message is titled "Let the Youth Be Tempered into Steel in Struggle." He said, "Now, the youth have a good environment for learning and living, and they have received a good education. They are more knowledgeable and have seen more than we did in our youth. However, no matter how much things change, the direction of the youth movement must be addressed. This is a serious issue and a profound lesson from the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing this past spring and summer. I believe that the direction of the youth movement in this current stage is the socialist direction. Youth should care about national and political affairs but should not deviate from the socialist track."

Xu Xiangxian hopes that the youth will establish a great communist ideal, overcome blind admiration for foreign cultures, and avoid self-deprecation. They should have the courage to face various challenges, love our country, our nation, and our socialism, and become defenders and builders of socialism. Only by linking their personal future and destiny with the future and destiny of the country can they have hope. This is a truth that history has taught us.

The older generation should care for, love, and help the youth. We should enthusiastically encourage their achievements and progress, and not discriminate against their mistakes. We should patiently guide them to distinguish right from wrong and raise their consciousness. Let the youth be tempered in struggle to become good steel.

Marshal Nie Rongzhen, in his message "The Youth Have a Heavy Responsibility and a Long Road Ahead," said, "Not long ago, we experienced a struggle to suppress a counter-revolutionary rebellion that was related to the life and death of the republic. The harsh reality tells us that the ideological battle is still very arduous and intense, and we cannot relax even a bit. The important task before us now is to educate the younger generation to firmly uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, which is the foundation of our country and the treasure of our nation. The youth are the successors of the revolutionary cause. The older generation of revolutionaries has handed down the country to the younger generation to defend, build, and develop. The younger generation has a heavy responsibility and a long road ahead. Therefore, our work should focus on the youth and the future. We should guide the youth to invigorate their revolutionary spirit, inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and through their hard work, create an even better new life."

Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission Bo Yibo believes that in today's situation, an important task is to educate and guide every young person to unite under the "four cardinal principles," so that these principles deeply take root in the hearts of every Young Pioneer and every young person, making the broad masses of young people deeply realize that our country is a socialist country, and we are building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our reforms are for the development of the socialist cause and the perfection of the socialist system. China has been able to stand independently among the nations of the world, and over the past decade, our country's reputation has greatly improved, and the people have actively supported and endorsed the correct policies of reform, opening up, and revitalization, precisely because we are firmly walking the socialist path. Socialism is the choice of history and is unshakable. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and without the Communist Party, there would be no socialist modern China. I hope that the young comrades will closely unite around the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, follow the socialist direction, and push our cause forward!

Bo Yibo said, "Our ideal is communism; our banner is the four cardinal principles; our task is to build a modern socialist New China."

Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission Song Renqing pointed out, "Our hope lies with the youth." He said, "At present, we must strengthen ideological and political work, especially the ideological work among young people. Dulles once said that the hope for a comeback in China lies with the third and fourth generations. We must not let Dulles' words come true. For a considerable period, we have rarely talked about upholding the four cardinal principles, rarely talked about revolutionary traditions, rarely talked about hard struggle, and rarely talked about resisting capitalist thoughts. This will inevitably have a negative impact on the youth and cannot guide them to grow healthily on the correct path. In the future, we must indeed strengthen ideological and political work, not just by issuing notices and resolutions, but by taking actions and measures, mobilizing the strength of the entire Party and society to do this. I believe that as long as we seriously and practically do a good job, the youth can definitely be nurtured well. The education of young people is important in both words and deeds, and in our actions."

    任重道远  百炼成钢
    新华社北京10月5日电　即将出版的《中国青年》第十期发表了徐向前、聂荣臻、薄一波、宋任穷等同志在建国四十周年之际对青年一代的寄语。
    徐向前元帅寄语的题目是《让青年人在斗争中百炼成钢》。他说，现在，青年人有了良好的学习、生活环境，受到了良好的教育，比我们年轻的时候，见多识广，情况有了变化。但无论怎么变，都必须解决青年运动的方向问题。这也是1989年春夏在北京发生的学潮、动乱以至反革命暴乱提出的一个严肃的问题，一个深刻的教训。我认为，现阶段青年运动的方向就是社会主义的方向。青年人关心国事、政事，不能脱离社会主义的轨道。
    徐向前希望青年人要树立共产主义的远大志向，克服对外盲目崇拜，对己妄自菲薄的情绪，克服怨天尤人的情绪，有勇气去迎接各种严峻的挑战，爱我们的国家，爱我们的民族，爱我们的社会主义，做社会主义的捍卫者、建设者。只有把自己的前途和命运同国家的前途和命运紧密地联系在一起，才有希望，这是历史告诉我们的真理。
    老一辈人要关心青年、爱护青年、帮助青年。对他们的成绩和进步要热情地鼓励，对他们的失误也不要歧视，要耐心地诱导。帮助他们明辨是非，提高觉悟。让青年人在斗争中千锤百炼，成为一块好钢。
    聂荣臻元帅在《青年一代任重而道远》的寄语中说，不久前，我们经历了一场关系到共和国生死存亡的平息反革命暴乱的斗争。严酷的现实告诉我们，思想战线上的争夺战还很艰苦，还很激烈，我们不能有丝毫的松懈。现在摆在我们面前的重要任务，就是要教育青年一代牢记坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，这是我们立国治国之本，传家之宝。青年是革命事业的接班人，老一辈革命同志打下的江山要交给青年一代来保卫，来建设，来发展，青年一代任重而道远。因此，我们的工作要着眼于青年，着眼于未来。要引导青年振奋革命精神，继承和发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，通过自己的辛勤劳动，创造更加美好的新生活。
    中顾委副主任薄一波认为，在今天的形势下，一个重要的任务就是教育和引导每一个青年，团结在“四项基本原则”下，使这些原则深深扎根在每一个共青团员和每一个青年心中，使广大青年深刻地意识到：我们的国家是社会主义国家，我们是在建设有中国特色的社会主义。我们的改革是为了发展社会主义事业，完善社会主义制度。中国所以能够独立于世界各国之林，10年来我们国家的声誉所以能够大大提高，人民群众所以积极拥护和支持改革、开放、搞活的正确政策，就是因为我们是坚持走社会主义道路的。社会主义是历史的选择，是不可动摇的。没有共产党就没有新中国，没有共产党也不会有社会主义现代化的中国。我希望青年同志们，要紧紧地团结在共产党、共青团的周围，沿着社会主义方向，把我们的事业推向前进！
    薄一波说，我们的理想——共产主义；我们的旗帜——四项基本原则；我们的任务——建设社会主义现代化的新中国。
    中顾委副主任宋任穷指出，我们的希望在青年。他说，当前，要加强思想政治工作，特别是加强青少年的思想工作。杜勒斯讲过，把在中国复辟的希望寄托在第三代、第四代身上。我们决不能让杜勒斯的话应验。相当长的时间里，我们很少讲坚持四项基本原则，很少讲革命的优良传统，很少讲艰苦奋斗，很少讲抵制资本主义思想，这就必然对青年产生消极的影响，不能引导他们在正确的道路上健康成长。今后我们必须切实加强思想政治工作，不只是发通知，通过决议，而要有行动，有措施，动员全党全社会的力量来搞。我相信，只要我们认真地扎扎实实地做好工作，青少年是一定能培养好的。对青少年的教育，重要的在于言传身教，在于我们的行动。
