	250,000 Americans Protest Government Housing Policies and Demand Aid for AIDS Patients

	Washington, October 7 (Xinhua) - Today was a weekend, but the atmosphere in Washington was far from peaceful. The White House, Capitol Hill, and the lawns around the Washington Monument, along with several major nearby streets, were teeming with people. Slogans, songs, and speeches blared from loudspeakers, creating a deafening noise. Tens of thousands of people from across the country were participating in two major petition activities: the "National March for Housing" and the "AIDS Quilt Memorial Exhibition." The organizers said their goal was to appeal to the White House and Congress to provide housing for the homeless and assistance for AIDS patients.

	At around 10:30 AM, 250,000 people from various walks of life gathered from all directions on the lawns surrounding the Washington Monument. They then formed a massive procession, holding various signs and banners, and marched along several nearby streets towards the north side of Capitol Hill. This was the largest protest since the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The protesters chanted slogans such as "We demand housing now!" Another procession, composed entirely of children, also marched along a different route, pulling small carts filled with petition letters. At 12:30 PM, the two groups converged on the north side of Capitol Hill and held a massive rally. Many speakers criticized the government's ineffective measures to solve the housing problems of the poor, particularly condemning the corruption scandal involving former Housing Department officials who profited from "low-income housing." They strongly demanded that the government increase funding and quickly provide affordable housing for the homeless. An organizer told reporters that it was a great irony that in the richest country in the world, millions of people were homeless.

	On the same day, the lawn directly opposite the White House Rose Garden was covered with colorful quilts, each adorned with the names and images of AIDS victims. Each memorial quilt was 6 feet long and 3 feet wide, symbolizing a coffin, and there were a total of 10,848 quilts, covering an area of 14 acres. From around 10:30 AM until evening, the lawn was filled with people. Some came to mourn the loss of family members or friends, while others came to express sympathy or simply to watch. A volunteer told reporters that the purpose of this memorial activity was to send a message to the Bush administration: "Provide assistance to AIDS patients and take major steps to prevent and control AIDS."

    25万美国人游行集会
    抗议政府住房政策
    要求国家救助艾滋病患者
    本报华盛顿10月7日电  记者张亮报道：今天是周末休息日，但华盛顿的气氛却显得很不平静。白宫、国会山及华盛顿纪念碑前的草坪和附近几条主要街道上人山人海，口号声、歌声和高音喇叭传出的讲话声震耳欲聋。来自全国各地的几十万人正在举行两大请愿活动，一是“要求住房全国大游行”，二是“艾滋病死者纪念被展览”。据组织者说，其目的是向白宫和国会呼吁：为无家可归者解决住房，为艾滋病患者提供帮助。
    上午10点多钟，25万各界群众从四面八方涌来，聚集在华盛顿纪念碑周围的草坪上，随后手持各式标语牌的男女老少组成一支浩浩荡荡的游行队伍沿附近的几条大道向国会山北侧进发。这是60年代民权运动以来规模最大的一次游行活动。游行群众边走边高呼“我们现在要住房”等口号。还有一支游行队伍全都由少年儿童组成，其中许多孩子拉着装满请愿信的小车沿另一条线路行进。中午12点半，两路大军在国会山北侧会合，举行了声势浩大的集会。许多发言者在讲话中批评政府在解决穷人住房问题上措施不力，特别抨击前住房部官员营私舞弊，大发“低收入者住房”之财的特大丑闻。他们强烈要求政府增加拨款，尽快为无家可归者提供可以住得起的房子。一位组织者对新闻记者说，在世界最富的美国竟有几百万人无栖身之地的确是一种莫大的讽刺。
    同日，白宫玫瑰园正对面的圆形草坪上铺满了五颜六色的被子，上面绣着各种图案的艾滋病死者的名字。每条纪念被长6英尺、宽3英尺，象征一具棺材，共铺了10848条，占地14英亩之大。从上午10点多钟到黄昏，草坪上的人络绎不绝，有的是来悼念死去的家人或亲戚朋友，有的是来表示同情或看热闹的。一位志愿人员对记者说，这一纪念活动的目的是为了向布什政府传递信息：“向艾滋病患者提供帮助，在预防和抑制艾滋病方面采取重大步骤。”
