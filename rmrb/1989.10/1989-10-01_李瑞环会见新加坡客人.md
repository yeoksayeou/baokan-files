Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, met with Mr. Mo Ruqu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Singapore-based Hwa Mei Furniture (Group) Company, and his delegation this afternoon at Zhongnanhai.

Mr. Mo Ruqu is in China to preside over the opening ceremony of the Tianjin Hwa Mei Furniture (Group) Company, which he invested in and built in Tianjin.

Li Ruihuan told Mo Ruqu that Chinese leaders have repeatedly stated that China's policy of reform and opening up will not change. Your investment project in Tianjin further concretely demonstrates that China will continue with reform and opening up in the future.
