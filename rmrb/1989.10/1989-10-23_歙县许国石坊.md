In the ancient cultural city of Xushan County, Anhui, there stands a grand stone archway that spans a street. It was built in honor of Xu Guangqi, a Minister of the Ministry of Rites and Grand Secretary of the Wuying Hall during the Ming Dynasty, and is thus named the Xu Guangqi Stone Archway. Due to its unique design with eight pillars, it is also commonly known as the Eight-Pillar Archway. It was constructed in the tenth month of the twelfth year of the Wanli era (1584 AD), making it over 400 years old.

The Xu Guangqi Stone Archway is modeled after wooden architecture, entirely made of hard, green tea-colored stone. It is robust and thick, with eight pillars, each measuring 50 centimeters square and over 7 meters high, topped by an additional 4 meters of connecting pillars. The beams, railings, brackets, and purlins are all made of large stone blocks, with each piece weighing up to four or five tons. The intricate joining of such heavy stones in mid-air showcases the advanced building techniques of the time.

The Xu Guangqi Stone Archway is adorned with exquisite carvings. Every pillar, beam, plaque, bracket, and purlin is decorated with symmetrical brocade patterns, arranged in a harmonious and elegant manner. One can see pairs of colorful phoenixes and rare birds soaring among the carved beams; dragons and mythical beasts in various poses displaying their might on the painted walls; twelve stone lions, each leaning against a pillar, standing majestically on the stone foundation, appearing lifelike and radiant, embodying the brilliant artistry of Hui-style stone carvings.

The archway is inscribed with calligraphy on all four sides. The characters, written in a style known as "guan ti" and "mo ku," are robust and elegant, flowing effortlessly. It is said that these inscriptions are the work of the Ming Dynasty calligrapher Dong Qichang. The Qing Dynasty poet Wu Meidian, in his "Hui City Bamboo Branch Poems: Ode to the Eight-Pillar Archway," wrote, "The Eight-Pillar Archway, the scholar's monument, the inscriptions loved by Dong Qichang," which serves as a testament to this belief.

　　歙县许国石坊
　　张恺
    在文化古城安徽歙县，跨街矗立一座宏伟的石牌坊，它因明代武英殿大学士礼部尚书许国而建，故名许国石坊。又因有八根柱脚，形制国内罕见，俗称八脚牌楼。它建于明万历十二年十月（公元1584年），距今有400多年历史了。
    许国石坊是仿木构造建筑，全采用质地坚硬的青色茶回石，粗壮厚实，八根柱子各有50厘米见方，7米多高，上面还有4米多高的接柱。梁枋、栏板、斗拱、雀替，全是大块石料，大件每块重达四五吨。如此笨重石料在空中接榫合缝，可见建筑技术之高。
    许国石坊有非常精致的雕饰，每一方石柱，每一道梁枋，每一块匾额，每一处斗拱和雀替，都刻有对称的锦纹图案，错落有致，疏朗多姿。只见成双结对的彩凤珍禽，翱翔于雕梁之间；千姿百态的游龙走兽，扬威于画壁之中；十二只倚柱石狮，雄踞于石础之上，形态逼真，栩栩如生，放射出徽州石雕艺术耀眼的光辉。
    石坊前后左右都有题签镌刻，那些馆阁体、擘窠书，貌丰骨劲，挥洒自如，相传出自明代书法家董其昌的手笔。清人吴梅颠《徽城竹枝词·咏八脚牌楼》有“八脚牌楼学士坊，题额字爱董其昌”之句，可为旁证。
