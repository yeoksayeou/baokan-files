The People's Daily published an article titled "Reflections on the Lessons of Incorrect Public Opinion Guidance" on October 12, which deeply and systematically reflects on the incorrect public opinion guidance during the political turmoil in the spring and summer of this year.

The article states that the main lessons from the two-month period of incorrect public opinion guidance are: the leadership of propaganda and public opinion must be in the hands of Marxists; news theory must adhere to the principle of party nature; news reform must grasp the correct political direction; and we must engage in a head-to-head struggle against the infiltration of overseas bourgeois public opinion.

The article says that the root cause of the incorrect public opinion guidance during the turmoil lies with Comrade Zhao Ziyang, in his three incorrect guidances on news work: first, the "Asian Development Bank" speech and its dissemination; second, the May 6 directive on reporting the student movement; and third, the criticism and opposition to the Shanghai Municipal Committee's correct decision to rectify the "World Economic Herald." The article says that facts have shown that the leadership of propaganda and public opinion must be in the hands of Marxists, in the hands of comrades who resolutely implement the party's line, principles, and policies. If power is lost, it will have extremely serious political consequences. The issue of leadership in propaganda and public opinion not only refers to the central government's macro-control over propaganda and public opinion but also includes the leadership of various public opinion fronts. By calmly summarizing the experiences and lessons of the two-month period of incorrect public opinion guidance, we must always place the issue of solving the leadership of propaganda and public opinion in an important position.

The article says that the incorrect public opinion guidance over the two months has had such a widespread and rapid impact on the news industry, which is inseparable from the fact that the bourgeois liberalization trend has confused news theory in recent years. The confusion in thought is to a large extent due to the confusion in theory. In recent years, some "news theorists" and "scholars" have spread a series of bourgeois news viewpoints, diluting and even denying the party's news theory and news policy. The manifestation of bourgeois liberalization in news theory is concentrated in one point: denying the party nature principle of socialist news work.

The article emphasizes that whether it is to defend the fundamental nature of socialist news work or to clarify the infiltration of bourgeois news theory, we must take the adherence to the party nature principle of news as the primary task on the news theory front. Party nature is the concentrated, conscious, and open manifestation of class nature. The party nature of the proletariat is the concentrated reflection of the fundamental and long-term interests of the people. The party nature principle of socialist news includes using Marxist worldview and methodology as the guiding ideology for news work, not using any other ideology to guide news work; the fundamental nature of news work as the mouthpiece of the party, government, and people, in the relationship between the party, government, and people, the party is the concentrated representative of the people's interests and the core leadership of the government, and news work should take the propagation and implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies as the primary task; the system of party leadership over news work, the party is the core leadership of all news work, party newspapers should be responsible to the party committee, all party organizations in news work must be responsible to the party, various news units may be connected to different social strata, but they must work under the leadership of the party; party propaganda discipline, all Communist Party members must strictly abide by it, and it is not allowed to publish speeches in public reports that go against the party's line, decisions, and directives; the party's pragmatic and realistic line of thought, the style of closely connecting with the masses, and the practice of criticism and self-criticism in news work, etc.

The article says that in adhering to the party nature principle of news, two kinds of ideological viewpoints deserve attention: one is the view that the party nature principle has become "outdated," and the other is the view that separates and opposes "people's nature" from party nature. The basic argument is: the party can make mistakes, but the people cannot make mistakes; when the party makes mistakes, news workers should stand on the side of the people, reflect the people's demands, and thus avoid making mistakes with the party. This view is contrary to Marxism.

The article points out that the incorrect public opinion guidance this time is also related to some news workers entering the wrong track of news reform. News reform is a component of the political system reform advocated and led by our party. News reform must be adhered to and deepened. At the same time, we must also see that news reform is highly political. If there are deviations, the social impact will be great, and the damage to the party and the people's cause will be large. Therefore, adhering to the correct political direction of news reform is the key to promoting news reform.

The article discusses the correct political direction of news reform from four aspects:

First, the relationship between news freedom and the social responsibility of news. News freedom must be guaranteed. However, news freedom has never been absolute; it itself contains the constraint of the social responsibility of news. At present, stability and unity are the most fundamental interests of the Chinese people. News media must consciously bear the social responsibility of maintaining stability and unity. Especially when society becomes unstable or even turbulent, news opinion not only should not fan the flames but also should not remain silent. The correct attitude should be to stand on the side of the party, government, and people, and clearly conduct correct guidance.

Second, the relationship between telling the truth and scientific social class analysis. In this incorrect guidance, "telling the truth" became a universal slogan. "Telling the truth" is not wrong in itself. News is a reflection of objective things and must be completely true. However, the "truth" we speak of should be the "truth" that strives to be consistent with the essence of objective things, the "truth" that is consistent with the whole picture of things, and the "truth" whose effect is to promote the healthy development of society. Otherwise, it may easily be "distorted." From the experience and lessons of public opinion guidance in this turmoil, news opinion, especially in the face of social events, social trends, or social turmoil, must conduct scientific social class analysis to grasp the true attitudes of the majority of society and truly speak for the people. In this turmoil, some news units' "truth" resulted in incorrect guidance, an important reason being the failure to correctly estimate the majority of the people, and some even thought that supporting the turmoil was "the will of the people." The reports had three more and three less: more reports on the square, more reports on the streets, more reports supporting and backing the students; fewer reports reflecting the grassroots situation, fewer reports reflecting the people's grievances about the turmoil, fewer reports reflecting the work and voice of the party and government. This provided one-sided materials to the masses and was directly related to this. Speaking the truth for the majority of the people is not just passively reflecting the social public opinion behind it, but more importantly, it is to truly tell the people the development trend of things and the fundamental interests of the people, and to use and mobilize the power of public opinion to conduct correct guidance and lead the people to consciously fight to protect social interests.

Third, the relationship between implementing public opinion supervision and correctly guiding public opinion. The ruling party and government need various supervisions, including public opinion supervision. From the perspective of news propaganda tools themselves, implementing public opinion supervision is one of their important tasks and is also a prerequisite for correct news opinion to be recognized by the public and to effectively conduct guidance. Public opinion supervision must be gradually strengthened, which is undeniable. At the same time, we cannot forget that the purpose of public opinion supervision is to improve and promote the work of the party and government, and to further strengthen the relationship between the party, government, and people. Therefore, public opinion supervision also has the issue of correctly guiding public opinion. We should, through reflecting the public opinion supervision of the party and government by society, improve the democratic awareness, maturity, and legal consciousness of all members of society; we should focus on reflecting the process of the party and government relying on the power of the people to fight against their own corruption and backwardness, improve the transparency of this struggle, and inspire the spirit of the people; we should, through correct public opinion supervision, fundamentally maintain the authority of the party and government representing the people. Public opinion supervision should pay attention to social effects, pay attention to timing and methods, and proceed in a democratic and legal manner. Especially in the extraordinary period when social trends or turmoil occur, it is particularly necessary to maintain and strengthen the authority of the party and government.

Fourth, the relationship between the initiative and creativity of news units in carrying out public opinion propaganda and strictly adhering to propaganda discipline. News units should resolutely obey the leadership and guidance of the party and government and strictly abide by propaganda discipline. Especially in the complex situation when society experiences trends or turmoil, it is necessary to strengthen the party's direct leadership over news work, propose requirements for propaganda work, what to propagate, what to oppose, what to support, and timely inform news units of the overall situation behind local phenomena and the deep background behind surface phenomena, so as to cooperate with each other. Strengthening the party's leadership over the news industry and disciplinary constraints is not to make news units violate news laws and work in an administrative manner. On the contrary, the party should improve its leadership art and improve the party's leadership over news work, making it more in line with news laws; the news industry should actively study the scientific laws and various methods of public opinion propaganda guidance in different social situations, in line with the party's line, principles, and policies, with the will of the people and the acceptance of the audience, so as to actively, skillfully, and effectively fulfill their social responsibilities.

In this turmoil, the United States and some other Western countries intervened from the beginning. "Voice of America" and other overseas propaganda agencies manufactured and spread a large number of rumors every day in Beijing and across the country, inciting trouble. Especially after the central government took measures to suppress the turmoil, "Voice of America" and other Western news media, as well as some Taiwan and Hong Kong newspapers, maliciously slandered us with "bloodbath in Tiananmen Square," attempting to confuse people and incite those who do not know the truth to "indignation," stirring up the irrational enthusiasm of the masses; they frequently spread rumors of "splits" in our leadership and "internal strife" in the military, to boost the morale of counter-revolutionary rioters and further confuse people's minds; they manufactured various strange rumors, aiming to make people mistakenly believe that the "political situation is unstable"; they repeatedly advocated the "sanctions" of some Western countries, intimidating and deceiving the Chinese people. For a period of time, not only did our overseas propaganda fail to counter the anti-China propaganda abroad, losing the opportunity, but some domestic news units also did not clarify the large number of "imported" rumors. A few news workers even consciously or unconsciously took overseas public opinion as their guidance, "obtained the situation" and "information" from it, and in turn aggravated their own incorrect guidance of public opinion. Overseas rumors had a great impact in China for a period of time, causing great confusion among the masses. This lesson is worth reflecting on.

The article says that China is already an open country. It is impossible to close the door and not let all overseas voices come in. The key is to distinguish and struggle. We need to break old frameworks and some unnecessary taboos, resolutely expose the true nature of foreign rumors and the so-called "objective and impartial" nature of bourgeois public opinion institutions, improve the people's ability to distinguish, and fundamentally enhance the domestic masses' ability to withstand and resist foreign propaganda.

    舆论导向错误教训深刻
    据新华社北京10月13日电　上海《解放日报》10月12日发表严一涛的文章《试论舆论导向错误的教训》，对在今年春夏之交的政治动乱中，新闻舆论导向的错误，进行深刻系统的反思。
    文章说，两个月舆论导向错误的主要教训是：宣传舆论的领导权必须掌握在马克思主义者手中；新闻理论必须坚持党性原则；新闻改革必须把握正确的政治方向；必须同海外资产阶级舆论的渗透进行针锋相对的斗争。
    文章说，动乱中舆论导向错误的根子在于赵紫阳同志，在于他对新闻工作的三次错误导向：一是“亚行”讲话及其传播示范，二是“5·6”关于学潮报道的指示，三是对中共上海市委整顿《世界经济导报》正确决定的指责和非难。文章说，事实说明，宣传舆论的领导权，必须掌握在马克思主义者手中，掌握在坚决执行党的路线和方针政策的同志手中。如果大权旁落，就会造成极其严重的政治后果。宣传舆论的领导权问题，不仅指中央对宣传舆论进行宏观调控的领导权，也包括各舆论阵地的领导权。冷静总结两个月舆论导向错误的经验教训，我们必须把切实解决宣传舆论领导权问题，始终放在一个重要的地位上。
    文章说，两个月中舆论导向的错误，对于新闻界的波及如此广泛、迅速，是同近几年来资产阶级自由化思潮搞乱了新闻理论分不开的。思想的混乱在很大程度上来自于理论的混乱。近几年来，某些“新闻理论家”和“学者”散布了一系列资产阶级新闻观点，淡化甚至否定党的新闻理论和新闻政策。资产阶级自由化在新闻理论上的表现，集中到一点，就是否定社会主义新闻事业的党性原则。
    文章强调，无论是从捍卫社会主义新闻事业的根本性质，还是从澄清资产阶级新闻理论的侵蚀来说，我们都必须把坚持新闻的党性原则，当作新闻理论战线的首要任务来抓。党性是阶级性的集中的、自觉的、公开的表现。无产阶级党性，是人民根本的、长远的整体利益的集中反映。社会主义新闻的党性原则，包括以马克思主义的世界观、方法论为新闻工作的指导思想，而不是以任何别的思想来指导新闻工作；新闻事业作为党、政府和人民喉舌的根本性质，在党、政府、人民三者关系中，党是人民利益的集中代表，又是政府的领导核心，新闻事业应当以宣传和贯彻党的路线、方针、政策为首要任务；党领导新闻事业的体制，党是所有新闻事业的领导核心，党报应当对党委负责，所有新闻事业中党组织，都必须对党负责，各类新闻单位所联系的社会阶层可以有不同，但都必须在党的领导下进行工作；党的宣传纪律，所有共产党员，都必须严格遵守，决不允许在公开报道中发表违背党的路线、决定和指示的言论；党的实事求是的思想路线，密切联系群众的作风和批评与自我批评在新闻工作中的贯彻等。
    文章说，在坚持新闻的党性原则上，有两种思想观点值得引起注意，一种是认为党性原则已经“过时”，一种是把“人民性”与党性分割开来、对立起来的观点。其基本说法是：党会犯错误，人民不会犯错误；当着党犯错误的时候，新闻工作者就要站在人民的立场上，反映人民的要求，才能避免跟着党犯错误。这个观点是违反马克思主义的。
    文章指出，这次新闻舆论导向的错误，与一些新闻工作者走入新闻改革的误区也有关系。新闻改革是我们党倡导和领导的政治体制改革的组成部分。新闻改革必须坚持和深化。同时，我们也要看到新闻改革的政治性强，如果出现偏差，则社会影响很广，给党和人民的事业造成的损失也大。因此，坚持新闻改革的正确的政治方向是推进新闻改革的关键。
    文章从四个方面论述新闻改革必须把握正确的政治方向：
    一、新闻自由与新闻的社会责任的关系。新闻自由是必须保证的。但是新闻自由从来就不是绝对的，其本身就包含着新闻的社会责任的制约。在当前，安定团结是我国人民最根本的利益，新闻媒介必须自觉地承担维护安定团结的社会责任。尤其是在社会出现不稳定甚至发生动乱的时候，新闻舆论不但不允许推波助澜，而且也不应当回避沉默。正确的态度，应当站在党、政府、人民的立场上，旗帜鲜明地进行正确的导向。
    二、说真话与科学的社会阶级分析的关系。在这次导向错误中，“说真话”成为一个普遍的口号。“说真话”本来并没有错，新闻是客观事物的反映，必须完全真实。但是，我们说的“说真话”，应当是力求符合客观事物本质的“真”，合乎事情全貌的“真”，其效果是推动社会健康向上的“真”，否则，就很可能是“失真”。从这次风波中舆论导向的经验教训看，新闻舆论在社会事件、社会风潮或社会动乱发生的情况下，尤其应当进行科学的社会阶级分析，才能把握住社会多数成员的真实态度，真正为人民说真话。这次动乱中，一些新闻单位的“真话”，结果变为导向错误，一个重要原因是没有正确地估计人民的大多数，有的甚至以为支持动乱是“国内民心所向”。报道中出现了三多三少：广场新闻多，马路新闻多，支持和声援学生的新闻多；反映基层情况的新闻少，反映人民群众对骚乱、动乱怨声载道的新闻少，反映党和政府的工作和声音的新闻少。给群众提供了片面的材料，与此有直接关系。为大多数人民说真话，并不是跟在社会舆论后面被动地反映，更重要的，是要把事物的发展趋势、人民的根本利益所在真正告诉人民，并借助和运用公众舆论的力量进行正确导向，引导人民为保护社会利益而自觉起来斗争。
    三、实行舆论监督和正确引导舆论的关系。执政党和政府需要各种监督，其中包括舆论监督。从新闻宣传工具本身而言，实行舆论监督是其重要任务之一，也是正确的新闻舆论能够得到公众认同，能够有效实行导向的前提之一。舆论监督必须逐步加强，这是毫无疑问的。同时，我们不能忘记，舆论监督的目的，是改善和促进党和政府的工作，进一步密切党、政府和人民的关系。因此，舆论监督同样有一个正确引导舆论的问题，我们要通过反映社会舆论对党和政府的监督，提高全体社会成员的民主自觉性、成熟性和法制观念；要着重反映党和政府依靠人民的力量同自身的腐败、落后现象进行斗争的过程，提高这种斗争的透明度，振奋人民的精神；要通过正确的舆论监督，从根本上维护党和政府代表人民的权威，舆论监督要注意社会效果，要讲究时机和方式，要按照民主与法制的方式进行。尤其是在社会性的风潮或动乱发生的非常时期，特别需要维护和加强党和政府的权威。
    四、发挥新闻单位开展舆论宣传的积极性创造性和严守宣传纪律的关系。新闻单位应当坚决服从党和政府的领导和指导，严格遵守宣传纪律。尤其是在社会出现风潮或动乱的复杂的势态下，必须强化党对新闻工作的直接领导，提出对宣传工作的要求，应当宣传什么，反对什么，赞成什么，并把局部现象后面的全局势态，表层现象背后的深层背景等及时通报给新闻单位，以便互相配合。加强党对新闻事业的领导和纪律约束，决不是要新闻单位违背新闻规律，按行政的方式去工作，恰恰相反，党应当提高自己的领导艺术，改善党对新闻工作的领导，使之更符合新闻规律；新闻界应当积极研究舆论宣传在不同的社会势态下进行导向的科学规律和多样的方式，与党的路线、方针、政策，与人民的意愿以及受众的接受程度一致起来，以便积极、巧妙而有效地履行自己的社会责任。
    这次动乱，美国等一些西方国家从一开始就插手进来，“美国之音”等海外宣传机关，每天制造和传播大量谣言，在北京乃至全国煽动闹事。尤其是在中央采取平暴措施后，“美国之音”等西方新闻媒介及一部分台港报刊，大肆造谣诬蔑我“血洗天安门”，企图混淆视听，借以激起不明真相的人们的“义愤”，煽动群众非理性的狂热情绪；他们又频频散布我国领导层“分裂”、军队“内讧”的谣言，以替反革命暴徒壮胆，进一步搞乱人心；他们还制造种种离奇谣言，目的在于使人们误认为“政局不稳”；他们反复宣扬一些西方国家的“制裁”措施，恫吓和欺骗我国人民。在一段时间里，不但我们的对外宣传对海外反华宣传软弱无力，丧失时机，国内一些新闻单位对大量“舶来”的谣言也不予澄清。少数新闻工作者，还自觉不自觉地以海外舆论为自己的导向，从中“要形势”、“要信息”，反过来又加剧了自己对于舆论的错误导向。海外谣言在一段时间里，在国内造成很大影响，引起群众的极大困惑。这个教训，值得反思。
    文章说，我国已经是一个开放的国度。闭关锁国，不让所有海外声音进来，是不可能的。问题在于必须进行鉴别和斗争。我们有必要打破旧框框和一些不必要的顾忌，坚决揭露外来谣言的真相和资产阶级舆论机构所谓“客观公正”的本质，提高人民的鉴别能力，从根本上增强国内群众对于外来宣传的承受能力和免疫能力。
