**Crack Down on Counterfeit and Substandard Goods**

**Liu'an City: Substandard Goods Flood the Market**

**Hengnan County: Spoiled Food Everywhere**

Liu'an City Consumer Association, Song Jiaqi: Recently, our consumer association organized relevant departments to investigate the situation of counterfeit and substandard goods in the market and found that some counterfeit and substandard goods are flooding the Liu'an market, particularly in the categories of food, clothing, and daily necessities.

Food quality is substandard. After inspecting 839 food and beverage production and sales enterprises in the urban area, a total of 7,250 bottles of spoiled beer, 4,235 bottles of fruit juice, 9,221 cans of soda, 3,072 bottles of ginseng wine, and 3,715 kilograms of expired and substandard food were confiscated and destroyed, accounting for more than 20% of the inspected food. The Coca-Cola cans produced by Shanghai Pujing Beverage Factory are mostly only half full and of poor quality. The pastries from Hefei Yongkang Food Factory, as well as the powdered milk and dairy products from Hefei Health Cow Milk Factory and Dairy Factory, are all substandard. The qualification rate of local Liu'an food is only 26.6%. Thirteen grain stores in the urban area are selling unqualified rice and flour.

The situation with clothing is even worse. More than 90% of the knitted clothing sold by itinerant vendors outside the small commodity market on Huangdajie Street are fake or substandard goods. Some vendors pass off imitation wool uniforms as pure wool, rabbit fur products as sheep wool, and mix feathers with chicken feathers, fake silk with real silk, and synthetic leather with cowhide, making it difficult for consumers to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit items. A consumer spent over 40 yuan on a pair of "cowhide" shoes made of synthetic leather, which had the surface peel off and the heel fall off after just three days of wear.

Substandard household appliances are causing consumers to worry. The Dayu brand refrigerators assembled in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, have caused significant harm to consumers in our city: some refrigerators do not stop running, some do not cool, and some leak electricity and shock people. Users have no hope of returning the goods or getting them repaired, and they are in great distress. A young man from Liu'an Medical School bought a Bole brand color television from Bei Lei Store, but it did not produce sound or images. A farmer from Yongcheng County, Henan Province, bought 50 sets of counterfeit Yongjiu brand bicycle parts, assembled them in our city, and sold them. A young worker riding a counterfeit Yongjiu bicycle to work had the frame break and the wheel fly off. A citizen bought a Songlin brand floor fan from Liu'an Department Store, and due to the electrified shell, he was electrocuted and died.

Counterfeit and substandard goods are terrifying. Relevant departments can no longer treat this lightly.

**Hengnan County Broadcasting Station, Zhang Wenbiao:** Recently, our county's People's Congress Standing Committee investigated 100 food, catering, and meat sales units and found that these units have prominent issues of dirtiness, disorder, and substandard conditions.

None of the 34 inspected restaurants conduct disinfection of tableware or strictly use sales tools, and the staff rarely wear work uniforms and hats when on duty.

There are many counterfeit, substandard, and spoiled food items. Individual businesses and some collective stores in Xiangyang and Chashi Towns sell a large quantity of substandard soda from a privately operated beverage factory in Hengyang City. This soda is made from raw water mixed with colorants, saccharin, and flavoring, and it starts to smell bad within 10 days of production, making it undrinkable for customers. Some stores also sell severely moldy and spoiled peanuts, biscuits, canned goods, and other food items. The counter in the Xiangyang Supply and Marketing Cooperative's food store displays counterfeit Zhuyeqing wine, spoiled Shiguogong wine, and 113 bottles of canned goods. The sanitary conditions of the food processing industry are concerning. The food processing factory in Chashi Town has 2,250 pounds of peanuts, noodles, sesame seeds, and biscuits, all of which are severely moldy and spoiled. The entire processing plant is covered in dust, with cobwebs and rat droppings everywhere.

Food hygiene is related to people's health. We hope that relevant departments will widely and deeply promote the education and propaganda of food hygiene laws, strengthen management, and thoroughly change the dirty, disorderly, and substandard conditions in the food and catering industry.

    严查伪劣商品
    六安市：低劣贷物充斥市场  衡南县：变质食品随处可见
    安徽六安市消费者协会　宋家楷来信：最近，我市消费者协会组织有关部门调查了市场上伪劣商品的情况，发现一些伪劣商品充斥六安市场，其中吃、穿、用商品为害尤其严重。
    食品质量低劣。通过对市区839家生产、经营饮食、食品企业的检查，共收缴、销毁变质啤酒7250瓶、果汁4235瓶、易拉罐可乐9221筒、人参酒3072瓶、过期劣质食品3715公斤，占被检查食品数量的20％强。上海市浦江饮料厂生产的可口可乐饮料罐头绝大部分只装一半，质量低劣。合肥永康食品厂的糕点，合肥保健牛奶厂、乳品厂的奶粉、乳制品均不合格。六安地方食品的合格率也仅占26.6％。市区有13家粮店经营的大米、面粉质量不合格。
    穿的商品伪劣情况更加严重。我市黄大街小商品市场外来摊商经营的针织服装，90％以上都是假货劣货。有的将仿毛制服充纯毛，兔毛织品充羊毛。羽绒掺鸡毛，假丝充真丝，人造革充牛皮，等等，令消费者真假难分。一消费者花40多元买回的却是一双人造革的“牛”皮鞋，仅穿3天，鞋面表皮破裂，后跟脱落。
    伪劣家用电器令消费者提心吊胆。浙江杭州市组装的日芝牌电冰箱在我市售后，消费者深受其害：有的电冰箱不停机，有的不制冷，有的漏电打人。用户退货无望，求修无门，叫苦不迭。六安卫校一青年从蓓蕾商店购买一台杭州产的百乐牌彩色电视机，却放不出声音和图像。河南永城县一农民购买冒牌永久牌自行车散件50辆，在我市组装兜售。一青工骑冒牌永久自行车上班，突然车梁断、车轮飞。一市民从六安百货站买了一台松林牌落地电扇，因外壳带电，触电身亡。
    伪劣商品令人不寒而栗。有关部门再也不能等闲视之了。
    湖南衡南县广播站　张文标来信：最近，我县人大常委会调查了100家副食、饮食、肉食经营单位，发现这些单位脏、乱、差现象突出。
    被检查的34家饮食店，没有一家进行餐具消毒和严格使用售货工具，营业员上班很少穿戴工作服、帽。
    假、劣、变质食品多。向阳、茶市两镇的个体户和一些集体商店大量出售从衡阳市一家私人承包的饮料厂进的劣质汽水，这种汽水是用生水加色素和糖精、香精配制而成，出厂不到10天就发臭，顾客买后无法饮用。一些商店还出售严重霉烂变质的花生米、饼干、罐头和副食品。向阳供销社副食商店的柜台中摆有冒牌竹叶青酒，变质史国公酒和罐头113瓶。食品加工行业卫生状况令人担忧。茶市食品加工厂所存的花生米、面条、芝麻、饼干，共计2250斤，全都严重霉坏变质。整个加工场灰尘满地，蜘蛛网、老鼠屎随处可见。
    食品卫生关系到人们的身体健康。希望有关部门广泛深入地开展食品卫生法的宣传教育，切实加强管理，彻底改变副食、饮食行业的脏、乱、差现状。
