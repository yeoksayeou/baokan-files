Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th.

The People's Daily reports that since the beginning of 1989, various regions have seen a decline in market sales. According to the Ministry of Commerce, from January to July this year, out of 28 major commodities nationwide, only pork, fresh eggs, and radios saw a slight increase in sales. The remaining 25 commodities all experienced a decline in sales. The total retail sales of social commodities for the same period increased by 16.6% compared to the same period last year, but after adjusting for price increases, the actual figure decreased by 6.5%. Previously popular home appliances such as color TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners have shifted from a seller's market to a buyer's market. Some daily consumer goods have also seen significant changes in supply. The sales of items like salt, aluminum products, enamelware, and thermos bottles have also declined.

This phenomenon has sparked differing opinions. In the October 5th issue of the Market News, a reporter's commentary titled "Seemingly Abnormal but Normal, Crossing the Difficulties is the Pass" was published, offering some insights.

The commentary argues that after implementing the policies of rectification and deepening reform, last year's "panic buying" has disappeared, and market sales have returned to normal, effectively controlling price increases. According to the Ministry of Commerce, the rate of price increases this year has been gradually decreasing, with a 24.7% increase in the first seven months. After adjusting for last year's carryover factors of 18%, the new increase is less than 7%. Consumers' anxiety has significantly eased, leading them to postpone the "second phase" of purchases, shifting from "buying to preserve value" to "saving to preserve value." From January to July, the savings deposits of urban and rural residents nationwide increased by over 300 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. Additionally, controlling group purchasing power has alleviated supply-demand contradictions. Some authorities have concluded that the current market, though appearing weak, is actually stabilizing.

The commentary notes that recently, wholesale and retail enterprises have launched a "discount wave," with discounts ranging from 5% to 50%. This move initially won the favor of consumers. However, this year's consumer psychology is the opposite of last year. They shop cautiously, examining and selecting products repeatedly. The more you discount, the more they hesitate to buy. While discount sales do have some effect, the impact is limited. Products that consumers are not interested in remain unsold even after price reductions, while popular products sell well even without discounts. Recently, the fabric exhibition at Beijing's Longfu Department Store caused a sensation in the city. This fully demonstrates that the issue is not that products have no market, but rather that they need to be market-appropriate.

The fourth quarter is the peak sales season for currency injection, and producers and operators are very concerned about whether the market will continue to be weak or turn to a boom. The commentary reveals experts' predictions: stable with a slight increase, with no significant changes. Some places have shown signs that TVs, which have been stagnant for half a year, are starting to sell. The sales of some daily necessities are also gradually improving.

Authorities suggest that for the future market, one should neither be blindly pessimistic nor overly optimistic. On one hand, industrial and commercial inventories are increasing; on the other hand, overall social demand and supply still have a significant gap, with residents' social surplus purchasing power reaching over 500 billion yuan. Preliminary estimates indicate that the annual social commodity supply-demand gap for this year is around 80 billion yuan, with the surplus purchasing power in the second half of the year showing a trend of further increase, which will exert certain pressure on the market. Therefore, ensuring effective supply and providing consumers with more and better market-appropriate products is a crucial task for producers and operators. Some regions and departments have already taken effective measures to adjust industrial and product structures. In the first half of this year, Shenyang City closed, stopped, merged, and transformed over 100 enterprises with no market for their products and high energy consumption, focusing on supporting the production of famous, high-quality, new, and unique products. The market adaptability of products has improved, and economic benefits have increased by 28% compared to the same period last year, with tax revenue increasing by 32%. The Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Bureau timely adjusted the product structure, and before National Day, over 580 new products were launched, with many new varieties receiving consumer approval.

### 《市场报》评述各地市场销售下降现象  看似疲软  实趋稳定  应抓住时机调整结构增加适销产品

    《市场报》评述各地市场销售下降现象
    看似疲软  实趋稳定
    应抓住时机调整结构增加适销产品
    本报讯　进入1989年，各地市场相继出现销售疲软现象，据商业部披露，今年1至7月，全国28种主要商品中，除猪肉、鲜蛋和收音机销售略有增长外，其余25种商品销售都呈下降趋势；1至7月社会商品零售总额比去年同期虽然增长16.6％，但扣除涨价因素，实际下降6.5％。曾经炙手可热的家电产品，如彩电、冰箱、洗衣机、吸尘器等，卖方市场转为买方市场。一些日用消费品供应出现较大变化。食盐、精铝制品、搪瓷制品、保温瓶等销售也都下降。
    这一现象引起不同意见的争议。10月5日出版的《市场报》刊登题为《道似反常却正常，渡过难关是阳关》的记者述评，对此发表了一些看法。
    述评认为，贯彻治理整顿和深化改革的方针以后，去年的“抢购风”消失了，市场销售走上正常，有效地控制了物价上涨。据商业部反映，今年物价上涨幅度逐月回落，头7个月物价上涨24.7％，扣除去年翘尾巴因素18％，新增不到7％。消费者紧张心理大大缓和，推迟了“第二阶段”的购买，由“购物保值”转向“储蓄保值”。1—7月，全国城乡居民存款比去年同期增加300多亿元。加上控制了集团购买力，供求矛盾得到缓解。一些权威人士得出结论：目前的市场看似疲软，实趋稳定。
    这篇述评谈到，最近一个时期，商业批发和零售企业掀起一股“让利潮”，让利少则5％，多则50％。这一举动曾赢得消费者的欢迎。然而，今年的顾客购物心理与去年恰恰相反。他们购物慎重，对商品是看了又看，挑了又挑，你越降价，他越持币不动。不能说让利销售没有效果，但成效不大，人们看不中的商品降了价照样没人买，适销商品不降价买者仍然很多。前不久，北京隆福大厦举办的花布展销轰动京城。这就充分说明：不是产品无销路，而是要适销对路。
    第四季度是货币集中投放的销售旺季，生产者和经营者非常关心：市场将继续疲软，还是转向旺销？这篇述评透露了行家们的预测：稳中有升，不会出现大的变化。一些地方出现的迹象表明，积压半年之久的彩电开始动销。一些日用品销售也逐步有所回升。
    权威人士提出：对于未来的市场，既不应盲目悲观，也不可盲目乐观。一方面，工业和商业库存加大；另一方面，从总体上看，社会总需求与总供给的缺口仍然较大，居民社会结余购买力高达5000多亿元。据初步测算，今年全年社会商品供需差额为800亿元左右，结余购买力下半年仍有增大的趋势，这将对市场形成一定的压力。因此，确保有效供给，为消费者提供又多又好的适销产品，是生产者和经营者一项至关重要的任务。一些地方和部门，已经采取有力措施，调整产业和产品结构。沈阳市今年上半年关、停、并、转100多家产品无销路、耗能高的企业，集中力量扶持名优新特产品的生产，产品适销率提高，经济效益比去年同期增长28％，税收增长32％。上海市轻工局系统及时调整产品结构，国庆前夕，有580多种新品上市，许多新品种都受到消费者的欢迎。
