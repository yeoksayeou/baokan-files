The Polish United Workers' Party today expressed opposition to the government's proposed amendment to the cooperative law.

The government led by Solidarity recently submitted a draft amendment to the law on the organization and activities of cooperatives to the parliament. The draft proposes the abolition of almost all provincial and central-level federations of cooperative organizations and raises the issue of selling cooperative property.

In a statement issued today, the Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party pointed out that this amendment proves that the government is prepared to abolish state and collective ownership in a manner contrary to the constitution.

The statement said that cooperative organizations have the right to establish their corresponding representative bodies. The government's reform proposals should be agreed upon by the majority of members and implemented with their participation. The statement also expressed the view that cooperative property should be protected.

After discussing the draft amendment to the cooperative law prepared by the government, the Central Council of Polish Cooperatives also expressed strong opposition to the way in which the bill was drafted and its content. The Council said that the draft did not take into account the opinions and suggestions expressed by cooperative members beforehand, violated democratic principles, ownership laws, and the right to self-determination, and contravened the principle of protecting cooperative enterprises as guaranteed by the Polish constitution.

The Polish Cooperatives have decided to hold a national congress in December this year to give a formal response to the government's proposals regarding the amendment to the cooperative law. At present, some professional cooperative organizations have already severely criticized the draft amendment proposed by the government.

    波兰统一工人党表示
    反对政府合作社法修正案
    新华社华沙10月17日电  波统一工人党今天表示反对政府提出的合作社法修改草案。
    由团结工会领导的波兰政府最近向议会提出了修改合作社组织和活动法的草案，主张撤销几乎所有合作社组织的省一级和中央一级的联合会机构，并提出了出售合作社财产的问题。
    波兰统一工人党政治局为此在今天发表的声明中指出，这个修改方案证明，政府准备以违背宪法规定的方式，取消国营和集体所有制。
    声明说，各合作组织有权建立自己的相应的代表机构。政府的改革主张应该征得广大社员同意，并在他们参与下加以实施。声明还表示主张保护合作社的财产。
    波兰合作组织中央理事会在讨论了政府所制订的合作社法修改草案后也表示坚决反对这一法案的制订方式及其内容。理事会说，这一草案没有考虑合作社社员在此之前已经表达的意见和建议，破坏了民主原则、所有制法律和自决权利，违反了波兰宪法所保证的对合作事业实行保护的原则。
    波兰合作组织已决定在今年12月召开全国代表大会，对政府的有关修改合作社法的建议作出正式回答。目前，已有部分专业合作组织对政府提出的修改草案提出了严厉批评。
