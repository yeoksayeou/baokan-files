At a recent meeting on grassroots work in the Jinan Military Region, leaders at various levels used grassroots work as a mirror to identify problems within the leadership organizations, promoting clean governance and diligent work.

In recent years, leaders at various levels in the Jinan Military Region have focused on grassroots work, resulting in significant progress in grassroots construction. The region has seen the emergence of 754 exemplary companies and 165 advanced exemplary companies. In the face of these achievements, leaders at the military region, corps, division, and regiment levels have analyzed their own problems, identified shortcomings in organizational work, and studied measures for improvement.

Issues such as organizational staff interfering with soldiers' transfers, education, technical training, and voluntary service, as well as irregularities in the use of grassroots cadres, allocation of funds, materials, and equipment, and inspections and assessments, are problems frequently reported by grassroots units. Additionally, some grassroots units still face difficulties with electricity, water, bathing, and medical care. In analyzing these situations, participants pointed out that while there are objective constraints in solving these problems, a significant part of the issue lies in the lack of responsibility from leadership organizations towards grassroots construction. Therefore, while vigorously promoting clean governance, it is also necessary to strengthen diligent governance, combat laziness, and enhance revolutionary spirit and sense of responsibility. The meeting decided to implement three systems: first, military and divisional leaders, in addition to field inspections, must spend at least one month each year in grassroots units, with military region leaders spending at least half a month; second, insist on organizational staff taking on roles in grassroots units; third, implement on-site offices to resolve difficult problems encountered in grassroots construction.

    有了成绩找差距　廉政建设讲实效
  　济南军区改进机关作风
    据新华社济南电　（记者王志耘、谭道博）在近日结束的济南军区基层工作会议上，各级领导干部以基层工作为镜子，查找领导机关存在的问题，促进廉政勤政。
    近年来，济南军区各级领导干部扑下身子抓基层，基层建设有了明显进步，全区先后涌现出754个达标连队，165个达标先进连队。在成绩面前，军区、集团军、师、团四级领导干部解剖本级的问题，查找机关工作中的不足，研究了改进的措施。
    机关干部插手战士的调动、入学、学技术、转志愿兵等问题，以及在基层干部使用，下拨经费、物资、器材、检查考核等方面的不正之风，是基层反映比较大的问题。还有一些基层单位仍存在用电难、吃水难、洗澡难、看病难等问题。大家在分析上述情况时指出，解决这些问题固然有客观条件的限制，但很大程度上还在于领导机关对基层建设缺乏责任感。所以在大力推进廉政建设的同时，还要加强勤政建设，狠治懒散，增强革命事业心和责任感。会议研究决定实行三项制度：一是今后军师领导干部除跑面调研外，下基层蹲点每年不得少于一个月，军区领导不得少于半个月；二是坚持机关干部到基层代职；三是实行现场办公，就地解决基层建设中遇到的棘手问题。
