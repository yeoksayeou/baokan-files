Sichuan's Regenerated Rice Harvests Bountifully

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 18 (Reporter Ling Yun) This year, Sichuan Province's 6 million mu (approximately 400,000 hectares) of regenerated rice achieved a bumper harvest, with a total production of 600 million kilograms.

In tapping the potential of grain production, Sichuan Province has fully utilized the characteristic of having surplus light and heat energy after harvesting one season of early rice. This regenerated rice does not require re-seeding or transplanting. After harvesting the early rice, it only needs to leave one node of the rice stalk, apply a round of promoting bud fertilizer, and manage the field simply. The cost is low, and it is suitable for promotion in the hilly areas across the province. After several years of exploration, the planting technology of regenerated rice has become increasingly mature, and the yield per mu has been increasing year by year. Last year, the province developed over 4 million mu of regenerated rice, with an average yield of 80 kilograms per mu. This year, the province's 6 million mu of regenerated rice achieved an average yield of 100 kilograms per mu, with the highest yield reaching 250 kilograms per mu. The total production increased by 130 million kilograms compared to last year.

    四川再生稻丰收
    新华社成都10月18日电（记者凌云）今年四川省600万亩再生稻获得丰收，总产量可达6亿公斤。
    四川省在挖掘粮食生产潜力中，充分利用种一季中稻光照热能有余的特点，发展再生水稻。这种水稻不需再播种栽秧，只需在收割中稻后，留一节稻桩，施一次促芽肥，田间管理简单，成本低，适合在全省丘陵地区推广。经过几年的摸索，再生稻的种植技术日益完善，单产逐年提高。去年，全省发展再生稻400多万亩，平均亩产80公斤。今年全省600万亩再生稻平均亩产达到100公斤，最高的单产达到250公斤，总产量比去年增产1.3亿公斤。
