    At the invitation of the Chinese government, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat arrived in Beijing today for an official friendly visit. Chairman Yang Shangkun met with and hosted a banquet for the distinguished guest.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 4th - Reporter Wen Xian reports: Chairman Yang Shangkun met with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat this evening at the Great Hall of the People. Chairman Yang said that we have just celebrated the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and President Arafat's visit this time is of great significance.

    Arafat arrived in Beijing this afternoon at the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun for an official friendly visit to China. Chairman Yang, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended a warm welcome to President Arafat and once again congratulated him on his election as President of the State of Palestine.

    He said that over the years, the Palestinian people's struggle has been heroic and unyielding, which is admirable. We understand and sympathize with the Palestinian people, and we regard your victories as our own.

    Yang Shangkun praised the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for its series of flexible and pragmatic policies and practical steps taken in recent years to promote the Middle East peace process, which have won widespread acclaim from the international community. He said that the State of Palestine has been recognized by more than 100 countries, which is a major victory for the Palestinian people. In addition, the PLO has held four rounds of talks with the United States, injecting new vitality into the peace process for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. He hoped that the PLO would continue to strengthen its internal unity and solidarity with Arab countries on the basis of its existing achievements, and with the sympathy and support of all justice-loving countries in the world, continue to achieve new victories.

    When talking about the domestic situation in China, Yang Shangkun said that the situation in Beijing and the rest of the country is stable. Many foreign guests who participated in the 40th anniversary celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China have witnessed the stability of the situation in China, which has increased their understanding of China.

    President Arafat said, "There is an Arab proverb: 'In times of adversity, true friends are known.' China has firmly supported us in the most difficult times of the Palestinian movement and helped us overcome difficulties. We will never forget your support and assistance. On behalf of all Palestinian people, I express my heartfelt thanks to you."

    Arafat said, "The relationship between Palestine and China is a special and friendly one. I am not a guest in Beijing, but a true friend among you. The relationship between Palestine and China is something we have always been proud of. When the incident occurred in Beijing in June, we were worried. When you controlled the situation, we were happy."

    Before the meeting, Chairman Yang held a grand ceremony to welcome President Arafat at the East Gate Plaza of the Great Hall of the People.

    After the meeting, Chairman Yang hosted a banquet for the Palestinian guests.

    In his speech at the banquet, Chairman Yang said that the Chinese government and people are deeply concerned about the developments in the Middle East and firmly stand on the side of the just cause of the Palestinian people, supporting their struggle. We appreciate and support President Arafat's efforts to resolve the Palestinian issue fairly. We advocate resolving the Middle East issue through political means, including convening an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, as well as other political solutions deemed appropriate by the relevant parties, to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, enabling the countries in the region to live in harmony. We call on the Israeli authorities to follow the trend of the times and respond positively to the reasonable suggestions and proposals put forward by all parties, which will not only be beneficial to the development of the regional situation but also in the interests of all the peoples of the Middle East, including the Israeli people.

    In his speech, President Arafat first congratulated China on the historic achievements and fruitful results it has made over the past 40 years.

    When talking about the Middle East issue, Arafat condemned Israel's brutal policies. He said, "Our people have suffered huge losses in terms of manpower and resources. So far, about 1,000 people have been killed, more than 47,000 injured, and about 67,000 arrested. Nevertheless, we are still determined to achieve a just peace in the Middle East. To this end, we have taken bold peace initiatives." These initiatives include seeking a just political solution through convening an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations, welcoming free and democratic elections, and supporting solutions similar to the Namibian model.

    Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Liao Hansheng, Minister of Aerospace Industry Lin Zongtang, Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan, and Chairman of the State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense Ding Henggao, and other relevant department heads attended the banquet tonight.
