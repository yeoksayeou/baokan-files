Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 8th.

CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin this afternoon met with some foreign guests and representatives from both sides of the Taiwan Strait who attended the academic discussion conference marking the 2540th anniversary of Confucius' birth at the Beijing Hotel.

In his speech, Jiang Zemin congratulated the conference's convening. He said, "It is a pleasure to have friends coming from afar." He expressed his gratitude to the guests for participating in the discussion.

Jiang Zemin told the experts and scholars from various countries and regions, "You come from different countries and regions. Although your countries have different social systems, I believe that the cultural heritage of each country belongs not only to that country but to the whole world."

Jiang Zemin said, "Confucius was a great thinker in ancient China. His thoughts are a precious cultural heritage of our country. We should inherit and learn from all the good things in Confucius' thoughts. However, due to the limitations of the times, there are also some outdated elements in Confucius' thoughts. In summary, we should take the essence and discard the dross of Confucius' thoughts, and educate our descendants to carry forward the excellent traditions of the nation."

During the meeting, Jiang Zemin also answered questions from scholars from the United States, West Germany, Singapore, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union regarding how to evaluate Confucian teachings and the relationship between Confucian thoughts and China's modernization.

Honorary Chairman of the Chinese Confucius Foundation Gu Muqi, Chairman Kang Yaming, and others attended the meeting.
