Indian opposition MPs walked out of the Indian Federal Council meeting held on the morning of the 11th, causing a commotion in Parliament over the issue of Indian officials accepting a $50 million bribe from the Swedish Bofors arms company. According to the *Indian Express*, new evidence has emerged proving that Indian government officials received approximately $50 million in bribes when they struck a $1.3 billion deal to purchase cannons from the Swedish Bofors arms company in 1986.

When the Federal Council Chairman announced the start of the meeting, opposition MPs disrupted the proceedings, demanding that the Parliament summon the Prime Minister to explain the matter. After their request was rejected, they angrily walked out of the chamber in protest.

This parliamentary session is the last before the December Indian general election. The opposition parties are using this scandal to jointly accuse the government.

    印度在野党议员退出议会会场
    印度在野党议员在十一日上午召开的印度联邦院会议上，就印度官员接受瑞典博福斯军火公司五千万美元的贿赂一事大闹议会。据《印度教徒报》透露，有新的证据证明印度政府官员在一九八六年与瑞典博福斯军火公司达成一笔购买十三亿美元的大炮的交易时，收取了约五千万美元的贿赂。
    当联邦院议长宣布开会时，在野党议员起来阻挠会议议程，要求议会传唤总理到会对此事作出解释。当在野党议员的要求被拒绝后，他们愤然退出会场以示抗议。
    这次议会是十二月印度大选前召开的最后一次会议，在野党利用这一丑闻，联合指责政府。
