In the golden autumn of Beijing, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army organized the grand song and dance performance "People's Army Loves the Motherland," presenting a song of joy and dance to the Republic on its birthday.

When the military band played the majestic melody of "Long Live the Motherland" at the Workers' Stadium in the capital, the curtain of the grand song and dance performance was lifted. The giant national flag, surrounded by soldiers from all three services, slowly rose amidst the solemn and resonant singing. The red radiance reflected the soldiers' splendor; the shining stars symbolized the soldiers' loyalty and dedication to the Party.

Next, the directors used a freehand style and poetic structure to arrange a grand chorus and group dance based on the imagery of Chairman Mao's poem "Snow: A Stylized Poem." The melodious singing that seemed to echo in the vast sky, the expansive snowfields depicted on the large backdrop, and the flowing white dresses of over a hundred female performers evoked deep nostalgia for revolutionary history.

A melodious flute tune led the audience to the Long March. The second act, "Unforgettable Years," showcased the hardships of founding the nation and the difficulties of maintaining it. If "Crossing the Snowy Mountains and Grasslands," "Bitter Vegetables," "March of the Big Knives," and "Embroidering the Red Flag" were a vertical exploration of revolutionary struggles, then "Remembering Comrades," "Riding Horses and Carrying Guns Around the World," and "Bloody Splendor" were a horizontal display of the army's achievements.

The third act, "I Love My Motherland," selected 19 highlights from songs and dances, using thick brushstrokes and rich colors to express the soldiers' deep love for their country. When the double suona introduced "Chinese Beauty" with a rough and rustic national flavor, people seemed to see a vast expanse of yellow earth and the toil and harvest on it; "Who Doesn't Praise Our Hometown" echoed like the song of a lark in the green mountains and waters, bringing a refreshing coolness like droplets of green; and when the simple and pure "In the Field of Hope" rang out, the colorful scenery of the motherland was artistically presented to the audience.

"The Motherland, Please Inspect Us" was the climax of the entire song and dance performance. At this moment, the symphonic chorus played a powerful and vigorous melody. The brass instruments in the mid-range music vividly depicted the solemn and majestic atmosphere of the parade ground; the grand chorus, with its soaring melody and rich harmonies, displayed the majestic posture of the army; the string instruments played a low, plaintive melody on the G string, recalling the army's arduous journey once again. Amidst the advancing melody, the three-service honor guard took precise steps, the gleaming steel guns shone with military bearing, and the powerful formations displayed strength. The musical theme of accepting the inspection cleverly shifted and reappeared in seven remote keys, as if the formations of various military branches and arms were rolling forward one after another. We heard the majestic footsteps. Indeed, the People's Republic is advancing, and the people's army is advancing!

    爱国爱民情切切
    ——“人民军队爱祖国”大型歌舞演出侧记
    王志成
    在北京金色的秋天里，中国人民解放军总政治部主办了“人民军队爱祖国”大型歌舞演出，向共和国华诞献上了一曲乐与舞的颂歌。
    当军乐队在首都工人体育馆奏响《祖国万岁》的雄壮旋律时，大歌舞的序幕拉开了。三军将士簇拥的巨幅国旗在庄严宏亮的歌声中徐徐地升起。那红色的辐射，辉映着军人的丰采；那五星的闪耀，表现了军人对党的忠诚和奉献精神。
    接着，编导者采用写意的手法和诗化的结构，编排了以毛主席词《沁园春·雪》为意境的大合唱与群舞。那如在万里长空中回响的悠扬歌声，那巨幅背景画上展现的茫茫雪原，那百多名女演员飘逸旋转的白色长裙，唤起了人们对革命历史的深情追忆。
    一曲悠扬的笛声把人们带到长征路上。第二场《难忘的岁月》向人们展示了创业的悲壮和守业的艰辛。如果说《过雪山草地》、《苦菜花》、《大刀进行曲》和《绣红旗》是对革命斗争的纵向透入的话，那么，《怀念战友》、《骑马挎枪走天下》和《血染的风采》则是对我军业绩的横向铺展。
    第三场《我爱我的祖国》采撷了19段歌曲和舞蹈中的精华，以浓重的笔墨、浓厚的色彩抒发军人浓烈的爱国之情。当双唢呐带着粗犷的民族风韵引出《中华美》时，人们仿佛看到一片辽阔的黄土地和黄土地上的耕耘和收获；而《谁不说俺家乡好》则如百灵鸟的歌声在青山绿水中回荡，让人感到滴滴青翠般的清凉；待质朴纯真的《在希望的田野上》响起时，万紫千红的祖国美景艺术地展现在人们面前。
    《祖国啊，请您检阅》是整台歌舞的高潮，这时的交响合唱奏响了刚劲有力的音符。钢管乐在中音区的音乐表现，浓烈地渲染了阅兵场威武庄严的气氛；大合唱以激越的旋律与丰富的和声把雄壮的军队英姿展现在人们面前；弦乐器在G弦上一段如诉如泣的低音演奏，再一次回顾了我军走过的艰难历程。就在这旋律的推进中，三军仪仗队迈开了严整的步伐，铮亮的钢枪闪现着军容，威武的方队展示着力量。接受检阅的音乐主题在七个远关系调上巧妙地转换、再现，有如各军、兵种的方队一个接一个滚滚而来。我们听到了雄壮的脚步声。是啊，人民共和国在前进，人民的军队在前进！
