Premier Li Peng of the State Council visited the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this evening to see off Paul Victor Obeng, a member of the Ghana National Provisional Defense Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

Obeng concluded his three-day visit to Beijing and will fly to Shanghai this evening.

Li Peng said to Obeng, "I hope that through your visit, Sino-Ghanaian friendship will be further developed."

Obeng said, "China is a very reliable friend of ours." He expressed his gratitude for the warm reception he received from the Chinese government and people.

Li Peng told Obeng, "You can be completely at ease when dealing with China. China will not pursue hegemony, because we are also a developing country."

He asked Obeng to convey greetings from the Chinese leadership to Chairman Rawlings of the Ghana National Provisional Defense Council.

Before bidding farewell, the two countries signed the "Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Ghana on the Grant of an Interest-Free Loan by the Government of the People's Republic of China to the Government of the Republic of Ghana" and the "Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Ghana for the Promotion and Protection of Investments."
