One week ago, on October 3, a coup by mid-level military officers against Panama's Defense Forces Commander Noriega occurred in Panama. The coup failed on the same day. However, the outcome of the coup has sparked a debate in the U.S. political arena that has yet to subside.

The focus of the debate is whether the U.S. should have taken advantage of the coup to intervene militarily and overthrow Noriega. Some members of the U.S. Congress who hold a hardline stance believe that the coup in Panama provided the U.S. with a good opportunity. The U.S. should have used military force to support the coup plotters and overthrow Noriega. These members criticize the Bush administration for hesitating and missing the opportunity. High-ranking officials in the government, however, argue that the government is not against military intervention but that the true intentions of the coup are unclear, and the timing for military action is not ripe. Therefore, they cannot send Americans to take risks without a clear purpose. This debate is intriguing because the point of contention is not about the U.S. policy towards Panama but rather about the timing of military intervention. It shows that in the U.S., there are many who are eager to intervene militarily in Panama to achieve the goal of ousting Noriega.

Secondly, the U.S. has deep-seated grudges against Noriega, including accusations of his involvement in drug trafficking. From the previous administration to the current one, a common point in U.S. policy towards Panama is to oppose the Noriega regime by all means necessary. The Reagan administration had used diplomatic and economic sanctions to try to force Noriega to step down, but it was unsuccessful. After the Bush administration took office, it continued the previous administration's policy, maintaining pressure on Panama. Although the Bush administration did not publicly take military action against the coup, its officials repeatedly reaffirmed that the U.S. policy towards Noriega has not changed and that the U.S. still reserves the option to use military force against Panama. In Congress, although some members criticized the government, the Senate recently passed a resolution reaffirming support for the president to take all appropriate diplomatic, economic, and military measures against Panama. All of the above reveals the hegemonic politics in U.S.-Panama relations.

However, recent developments indicate that the current U.S. policy towards Panama not only does not work but also puts U.S. diplomacy in a dilemma. In this debate, the government's argument for not using force is based on the timing not being ripe. But if, as some members claim, this was a good opportunity, what would be the result of getting involved in military action? The New York Times pointed out that even if the U.S. successfully intervenes militarily, it would have serious consequences and pay a huge price. The U.S. public opinion points out that the consequences and prices are mainly in three aspects: first, military intervention may drag U.S. troops into prolonged warfare, resulting in heavy casualties; second, Latin American countries will certainly condemn it, and anti-U.S. sentiment will rise; third, U.S. troops involved in local coups will greatly shake the U.S. military presence in other countries. From the U.S. comments, military intervention does not serve U.S. interests, let alone the fact that such intervention goes against the trend of the times. This debate over the Panama coup once again exposes the dilemma faced by the hegemonic politics in U.S. diplomacy.

    巴拿马兵变与美国外交难题
    本报记者  张启昕
    一周前的10月3日，巴拿马发生了一起中层军官反对国防军司令诺列加的兵变，兵变当天即告失败。但围绕兵变的结局，美国政界发生了一场至今尚未平息的不小的争论。
    争论的焦点是，美国应否利用兵变之机进行军事干涉，一举把诺列加赶下台。美国国会部分持强硬态度的议员认为，巴拿马兵变为美国提供了良好时机，美国应该动用军事力量支持兵变官兵，推翻诺列加。这些议员批评布什政府犹豫不决，坐失良机。政府方面的高级官员则申辩说，政府并非不考虑军事干预，而是因兵变的真实意图不明，采取军事行动的时机尚不成熟，因而不能无目的地把美国人送去冒险。这次争论是耐人寻味的，因为争论的分歧点并非对美国的巴拿马政策提出异议，而只是对军事干涉的时机作出不同估价。它从一个方面表明，在美国，为了达到把诺列加赶下台的目的，热衷于对巴拿马进行军事干涉的颇不乏人。
    其次，美国与诺列加的积怨甚深，其中包括美国指责他参与贩毒。从上届政府到本届政府，美国对巴拿马政策的一个共同点是不惜一切手段反对诺列加政权。里根政府就曾使用外交和经济制裁，企图逼迫诺列加下台，但未成功。布什政府上台后，继续执行前任政策，保持对巴压力。对这次兵变，布什政府虽未公开采取军事行动，但其要员却一再重申美国对诺列加的政策未变，并称美国仍然保留对巴使用军事力量的选择。在国会，虽有部分议员对政府提出指责，但参议院在最近通过的一项决议中重申支持总统对巴采取一切适当的外交、经济和军事手段。上述一切，暴露了美国对巴关系中的强权政治。
    然而，近年来的事态表明，美国现行对巴政策不但行不通，而且使美国外交陷入困境。在这次争论中，美国政府申辩的论点是基于时机不成熟而未动用武力。但是，要是真像部分议员声称的这是个良机，卷入军事行动，结果又将如何？《纽约时报》指出，即使美国进行直接军事干涉得手，也会造成严重的后果，付出巨大的代价。美国舆论界指出其后果和代价大体有三个方面：其一，军事干涉可能使美军陷于长期作战，造成大量伤亡；其二，拉美国家必然同声讨伐，反美浪潮迭起；其三，美国海外驻军卷入当地兵变，将会大大动摇美国在其他国家的军事存在。从美国的评论来看，军事干涉并不符合美国利益，更何况这种干涉违背时代潮流。这场围绕巴拿马兵变的争论，再次暴露出美国外交中所包藏的强权政治面临的难题。
