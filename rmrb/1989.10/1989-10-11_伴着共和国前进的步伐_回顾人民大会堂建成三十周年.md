At 2:30 AM on September 9, 1959, Chairman Mao Zedong inspected the soon-to-be-completed Great Hall of the People. When Beijing Vice Mayor Wan Li mentioned that the building had not yet been named, Chairman Mao said meaningfully, "The Great Hall of the People is built by the people, so it should be called the Great Hall of the People!"

Over the past 30 years, virtually every major historical event that has shaped the development of socialist China has been linked to the name of the Great Hall of the People. Therefore, the Great Hall of the People has become a place that the people of the entire nation aspire to, and it has also become a place of global attention. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said during a meeting with guests, "The Great Hall of the People is a symbol, a symbol of our nation."

Over the past 30 years, the staff of the Great Hall of the People have changed generation after generation, but the meticulous care and warm guidance of the older generation of revolutionaries remain forever etched in their hearts.

One spring afternoon in 1963, after Chairman Mao met with foreign guests, he told the staff around him, "When you came to the Great Hall of the People, your educational level was not high. Don't just know how to wipe tables and pour tea. You should study politics, culture, and a bit of foreign language. Those who come here are foreign leaders. If you know some foreign language, it will be beneficial. Even I am studying!"

Soon after, he said, "The comrades working in the Great Hall of the People should have good political ideals, good service attitudes, and good health."

In early autumn of 1961, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, accompanied by Wang Guangmei, visited the Great Hall of the People. They inspected the collective dormitories of the staff and the underground workrooms, and warmly inquired about the work, study, and life of the employees. Chairman Liu encouraged everyone to study politics, professional skills, and culture, and to become talents useful to the motherland.

The kind and amiable face of Marshal Zhu De lives on in the hearts of the staff of the Great Hall of the People. In his busy schedule, Marshal Zhu often called the service staff to his side, kindly instructing them to serve Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee well. The five strong and powerful characters "Great Hall of the People" written by Marshal Zhu are still used as the official font for the Great Hall of the People.

The Great Hall of the People has a particularly close relationship with Premier Zhou Enlai. Many of the architectural designs, internal structures, and forms of the Great Hall of the People were based on Premier Zhou's ideas. He was the undisputed chief designer of the Great Hall of the People. He also led the way in volunteering to build the Great Hall of the People. From the beginning of its operation, Premier Zhou instructed that the entire work of the Great Hall of the People was to serve the political activities of the Party and the state. Since then, from the daily management and business construction of the Great Hall of the People to the lives of the employees, all have been imbued with Premier Zhou's heart and soul.

Premier Zhou's concern for the staff of the Great Hall of the People was even more paternal, caring, and meticulous. He was familiar with everyone who served him. If a comrade did not come to work for a few days due to illness, he would have someone convey, "Rest well, don't worry. Since you are here, you should settle down and overcome it." In July 1975, Premier Zhou, who was plagued by illness, dragged his extremely weak body to the Great Hall of the People for the last time to visit the places he had worked and the familiar old service staff.

According to Premier Zhou's suggestion before his passing, the service staff of the Great Hall of the People implemented a rotation system. Batch after batch of young comrades came from all over the country to serve the Party Central Committee at the Great Hall of the People. When they left, they all hoped to obtain a precious souvenir. The leadership of the Great Hall of the People Management Bureau considered this request and made exquisite souvenir albums, hoping to have Comrade Xiaoping write an inscription. On February 23, 1986, during the Lantern Festival, Comrade Deng Xiaoping came to the Great Hall of the People for activities. When he learned of everyone's urgent wish, he happily wrote "Work Souvenir" in four large characters for the souvenir album. After the leadership of the Great Hall of the People reported the recent work situation to him, he also wrote "Work Hard, Serve Well."

The heavy responsibility, high standards, large workload, and long hours are the outstanding features of the work at the Great Hall of the People. Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, the internal and external affairs tasks have been increasing day by day. In 10 years, a total of more than 40,000 internal and external affairs activities were received, with a total of more than 10.86 million participants. Under the conditions of fewer people and heavier tasks, comrades often work overtime, with an average of nearly 100 working days of overtime per person per year. But no one has a single complaint.

The activities of the Great Hall of the People are highly political and time-sensitive, often requiring a full-scale mobilization and launching a surprise attack. On October 16, 1986, at 4 PM, a memorial service for Marshal Liu Bocheng was held in the North Hall with 4,000 participants, and at 6 PM, a grand banquet for more than 1,500 people was scheduled in the Banquet Hall. The solemn and dignified memorial hall in the North Hall must be completely removed within 20 minutes after the end of the memorial service. At this time, all workers, chefs, logistics personnel, and office staff of the Great Hall of the People joined forces, and in just a few minutes, they cleared the scene and restored it to its original state.

The work of the Great Hall of the People has a clear guiding ideology, which is to wholeheartedly serve the political activities of the Party and the state, to serve the provinces and municipalities, and to serve the people.

For this reason, in the recent political turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that lasted for two months, in the face of the loudspeakers of the "Autonomous Federation of University Students" on Tiananmen Square blaring day and night, and various "support" groups passing by, more than 1,000 employees of the Great Hall of the People stood firm, held high their banners, guarded their posts, observed discipline, and did not participate in any supporting activities or similar activities. They protected the safety of the Great Hall of the People and actively and enthusiastically served the martial law troops.

On the night of New Year's Eve in 1979, the Great Hall of the People was brightly lit, with a sea of people. At that time, Deng Yingchao, then Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, happily told the 10,000 people in the auditorium, "The forbidden area of the Great Hall of the People has been broken, and it has returned to the embrace of the people!"

Since its opening in 1979, by the end of 1988, the Great Hall of the People has received a total of 32.94 million domestic and foreign visitors in 10 years, equivalent to three times the total population of Beijing.

Since the reform and opening up, due to the appropriate reform measures, the enthusiasm of the majority of employees has been unprecedentedly high, and there have been significant improvements in service quality, service attitude, banquet menu preparation, equipment management, logistics support, and security. Under the premise of completing political tasks and ensuring safety, an average annual economic income growth rate of 39% has been achieved. The total economic income in 1988 was 17.8 times that of 1979, which is more than four times. In the past, the Great Hall of the People completely relied on state financial allocations, with an annual expenditure of hundreds of millions of yuan. Since 1986, it has not only achieved self-sufficiency in administrative expenses but also been able to contribute hundreds of millions of yuan in taxes to the state each year.

    伴着共和国前进的步伐
    ——回顾人民大会堂建成三十周年
    新华社通讯员  新华社记者
    1959年9月9日凌晨2时半，毛泽东主席来到即将竣工的大会堂视察。当北京市副市长万里谈到，这座建筑还没有命名时，毛主席意味深长地说：
  “大会堂是人民建造的，还是叫人民大会堂好！”
    30年来，决定社会主义中国发展进程的每一个重大历史事件，几乎无不与人民大会堂的名字连结在一起。因此，人民大会堂成为全国人民向往的场所，也成为世界瞩目的地方。正如邓小平同志在一次会见客人时所说的那样：“人民大会堂是一个象征，是我们民族的象征。”
    30年来，人民大会堂工作人员换了一茬又一茬，但是老一辈革命家对大会堂工作人员的无微不至的关怀和亲切教导，却永远铭刻在他们心头。
    1963年春的一个下午，毛主席在会见外宾之后，对身边的服务员说：“你们来大会堂的时候，文化程度都不高。不要只懂得擦桌子呀，端茶倒水呀。要学政治，学文化，学点外语。到这儿来的都是外国首脑。你们懂点外语，有好处。连我都在学习嘛！”不久，他又说：“在大会堂工作的同志，要有好的政治思想，好的服务态度，还要有一个好的身体。”
    1961年初秋的一个星期天，刘少奇主席偕王光美同志来到大会堂，他们视察了工作人员集体宿舍，又来到地下室工作机房，亲切地询问职工的工作、学习和生活情况。少奇同志殷切地勉励大家，要学政治，学业务，学文化，成为对祖国有用的人才。
    朱德委员长慈祥和蔼的面容，至今活在大会堂工作人员的心中。在繁忙的工作之余，朱老总经常把服务员叫到身边，亲切地叮嘱他们：要好好为毛主席服务，为党中央服务。他亲笔题写的“人民大会堂”五个刚劲有力的大字，至今仍作为大会堂的标志所用的字体。
    大会堂与周总理有着特别亲密的关系。大会堂的建筑造型、内部结构和形式，很多都是根据周总理的思想设计的。他是大会堂当之无愧的总设计师。他还曾带头参加建造大会堂的义务劳动。大会堂投入使用之初，周总理就指示：人民大会堂的全部工作任务是为党和国家的政治活动服务。此后，从大会堂的日常管理、业务建设，到职工的生活，无不倾注着周总理的心血。
    周总理对大会堂的工作人员，更是以他那慈父般的胸怀，关心倍至，体察入微。他熟悉为他服务的每一个人。某一同志因病几天没来上班，他就叫人转告：“好好休息，不要着急。既来之，则安之，要去战胜它。”1975年7月，被病魔缠身的周总理拖着十分虚弱的身体，最后一次来到大会堂，看望他工作过的地方和熟悉的老服务员。
    根据周总理生前的建议，人民大会堂的服务员实行轮换制。一批批年轻的同志从四面八方来到大会堂为党中央服务。当他们离开时都希望得到一件珍贵的纪念品。大会堂管理局领导考虑到同志们这一要求，制作了精美的纪念册，想请小平同志题词。1986年2月23日，正值元宵佳节，邓小平同志来大会堂活动。当他得知大家的迫切愿望时，欣然提笔为纪念册题了“工作纪念”四个大字。当大会堂领导同志向他汇报了近期的工作情况后，他老人家又题写了“工作努力，服务周到”。
    责任重，要求高，工作量大和时间长，是大会堂工作的突出特点。特别是党的十一届三中全会以后，内外事任务与日俱增。10年间共接待内外事活动4万多次，参加活动的总人次达1086万多。在人员少，任务重的情况下，同志们经常加班加点工作，平均每人每年加班累达近百个工作日。但没有人有一句怨言。
    大会堂的活动，政治性、时限性很强，常常需要全局动员，打突击战。1986年10月16日，下午4时在北大厅举行刘伯承同志追悼会，4000人参加，而晚6时宴会厅又安排了1500余人的盛大宴会。北大厅隆重肃穆的灵堂必须在追悼会结束后20分钟内全部撤除。这时大会堂所有的工人、厨师、后勤人员、科室干部一齐上阵，只用了十几分钟就抢出了现场，恢复了原貌。
    人民大会堂的工作有一个明确的指导思想，就是全心全意地为党和国家的政治活动服务，为各省、市服务，为人民群众服务。
    正因为如此，在前不久发生的长达两个月的政治动乱和反革命暴乱中，面对天安门广场上高自联的喇叭昼夜鼓噪，各式各样的“声援”队伍从身边走过，人民大会堂1000多名职工立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚守岗位，遵守纪律，没有一个人参加声援和类似其他任何活动。他们保卫了大会堂的安全，并积极热情地为戒严部队服务。
    1979年除夕之夜，人民大会堂内灯火辉煌，万头攒动。当时任全国人大常委会副委员长的邓颖超同志在大礼堂高兴地对万名群众说：“人民大会堂这个禁区已被打破了，它重新回到了人民的怀抱！”
    人民大会堂自1979年开放以来，截至1988年底，10年间共接待国内外参观者3294万人次，相当于北京市人口总数的3倍。
    改革开放以来，由于改革措施得当，广大职工的积极性也空前高涨，在服务质量、服务态度、宴席菜点制作、设备管理、后勤保障、安全保卫等各方面都有长足的进展。在保证政治任务的完成和保证安全的前提下，取得了经济收入年均增长39％的高速度。1988年的经济总收入是1979年的17.8倍，翻了4番还要多。过去，人民大会堂完全依赖国家财政拨款，每年要开支数百万元，从1986年起，它就不但在行政经费上实行自立，而且每年还能上缴国家数百万元的税金。
