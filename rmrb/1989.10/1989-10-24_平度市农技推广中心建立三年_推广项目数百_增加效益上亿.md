Pingdu City Agricultural Technology Promotion Center in Shandong Province has adhered to the path of combining "experimentation, promotion, and training" in agricultural technology promotion, achieving good results. Over the past three years, it has promoted and applied 234 new technologies and achievements, with a cumulative promotion area of 8.7 million mu (approximately 580,000 hectares), increasing benefits by 150 million yuan.

The Pingdu City Agricultural Technology Promotion Center was jointly funded by the state, province, and city and established in 1987. It currently has 60 technical personnel. In recent years, they have focused on leveraging the comprehensive effectiveness of multiple disciplines, multiple specialties, and multiple measures to solve technical problems in agricultural production. In recent years, a disease known as "full blight," which is likened to "cancer" in wheat, has been rampant in Pingdu City. During the autumn sowing season of 1987, the technology promotion center organized soil, fertilizer, plant protection, and seed stations to tackle the problem, reducing the white ear rate in the prevention and control area by 50.72%, with an average yield of 428 kilograms per mu, an increase of 38.6% compared to 1986.

They have also focused on reforming cultivation systems, increasing the index of multiple cropping, and developing vertical planting. Since 1988, the city has respectively experimented with and demonstrated high-efficiency vertical planting models such as wheat-cotton, wheat-oil intercropping, and wheat-corn, with a total promotion area of 1.14 million mu.

　　平度市农技推广中心建立三年
　　推广项目数百　增加效益上亿
    据新华社青岛10月23日电  （通讯员宗绪昌、记者杨凤山）山东省平度市农业技术推广中心坚持走“试验、推广、培训”相结合的农技推广之路，收到好效果。3年多来，共推广应用新技术、新成果234项，累计推广面积达870万亩，增加效益1.5亿元。
    平度市农技推广中心是由国家、省和市共同投资于1987年建起的，现有科技人员60名。几年来，他们十分注重发挥多学科、多专业、多种措施结合的综合效能，为农民解决生产中的技术难题。近几年，被比作小麦“癌症”的全蚀病在平度市为害猖獗，1987年秋种时，技术推广中心便组织土肥、植保、种子等站室攻关，使防治区小麦白穗率下降50.72％，平均单产达到428公斤，比1986年增产38.6％。
    他们还在改革耕作制度、增加复种指数、发展立体种植上做文章。1988年以来，全市分别试验、示范的麦棉、麦油间作以及小麦、玉米等高效立体种植模式，推广总面积达114万亩。
