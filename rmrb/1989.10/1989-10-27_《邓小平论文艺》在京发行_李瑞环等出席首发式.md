Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th - The book "Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art" began its circulation in Beijing today. The launch ceremony was held in the afternoon at the Great Hall of the People.

Published by the People's Literature Publishing House and edited by the Literature Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, "Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art" is divided into two volumes. The first volume includes seven articles by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, such as "Congratulations on the Fourth National Congress of Literary and Art Workers." The second volume compiles Deng Xiaoping's remarks on literature and art, covering topics such as: achieving the Four Modernizations and building socialism with Chinese characteristics; constructing socialist spiritual civilization; the tasks of the ideological front; knowledge, talent, and intellectuals; adjustments and implementation of literary and artistic policies; and the necessity to eliminate interference and combat erroneous tendencies.

Comrades Li Ruihuan, Hu Qiaomu, Deng Liqun, He Jingzhi, Xu Weicheng, Xiao Lin, and other literary and propaganda figures attended the launch ceremony.

Li Ruihuan stated that the publication of this book will greatly promote the current ideological front, especially the cultural front, in eliminating the influence of bourgeois liberalization and adhering to the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought literary line. He urged literary figures to study "Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art," summarize experiences, clarify right and wrong, unify thoughts, and unite to strive for a better flourishing of socialist literature and art, and to better adhere to the direction of serving the people and socialism, as well as the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy.

Minister of Culture He Jingzhi described the publication of "Deng Xiaoping on Literature and Art" as a significant event in the fields of thought, culture, and publishing. He emphasized that upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization is closely related to literature and art. Literature and art cannot be separated from politics. The fate of the literary and artistic cause and individual artists is inseparable from the fate of the country. He expressed confidence that this book would be welcomed by the vast majority of comrades and friends in the cultural and artistic circles, and that most comrades, after calm reflection, would adopt a correct attitude towards learning, fully and accurately understanding its spiritual essence, rather than avoiding the light of truth.

Hu Qiaomu, Lin Mohan, and others also spoke at the meeting.

    由中共中央宣传部文艺局编辑、人民文学出版社出版的《邓小平论文艺》分为两辑，第一辑收入邓小平同志《在中国文学艺术工作者第四次代表大会上的祝辞》等7篇文章；第二辑摘录了邓小平同志关于文艺的论述，内容有：实现四个现代化，建设有中国特色的社会主义；建设社会主义精神文明；思想战线的任务；知识、人才、知识分子；文艺政策的调整与贯彻；必须排除干扰，反对错误倾向等。
    李瑞环、胡乔木、邓力群、贺敬之、徐惟诚、肖林等同志和文艺、宣传界人士出席了首发式。
    李瑞环说，这本书的发行，对于当前思想战线，特别是文化战线清除资产阶级自由化的影响，坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想的文艺路线，一定会起到极大的推动作用。他要求文艺界的同志通过对《邓小平论文艺》的学习，进一步总结经验，澄清是非，统一思想，团结一致，为更好地繁荣社会主义的文艺，更好地坚持文艺为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向和“双百”方针而奋斗。
    文化部代部长贺敬之用思想文化界和出版界的一件大事来形容《邓小平论文艺》的出版。他说，坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化不是与文艺无关，而是密切相关。文艺不能脱离政治。文艺事业和文艺工作者的个人命运与国家的前途命运是分不开的。他表示相信这本书一定会受到文化艺术界广大同志和朋友的欢迎，绝大多数同志经过冷静地回顾和反思会采取正确的学习态度，全面地、准确地理解它的精神实质，而不是避开真理的光芒。
