The 28th Central Committee Plenum of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) resumed today after a one-week hiatus. The first item on the agenda was a discussion on the LCY Presidium's stance regarding the political and ideological essence of the current attacks on Tito's personal character, role, and legacy, as well as the tasks shouldered by LCY members to repel and expose these attacks.

In his report, LCY Central Committee Chairman Miloš Pančević pointed out that certain individuals, with malicious intent, have been seeking or misinterpreting various trivial matters from Tito's life and work to tarnish his reputation, thereby undermining the LCY's achievements under his leadership. They are attacking and denying Tito personally, as well as the People's Liberation War of Yugoslavia, the revolution, the anti-fascist principles of the People's Liberation Committees on which Yugoslavia was founded, the unity, friendship, and equality of the peoples of Yugoslavia, the federal system, the role of the LCY, and the socialist self-management system.

Pančević believes that Tito and the LCY have always had their political opponents, so the current attacks on Tito are not surprising. However, what is concerning is that the LCY and the entire society have not taken timely and reasonable actions to respond to this, and some LCY members have even made unprincipled criticisms or attacks on Tito's legacy. He stated that such situations must no longer be allowed to continue in the LCY and other autonomous socialist forces.

During today's meeting, 24 Central Committee members spoke.

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution on the ideological and political essence of the attacks on Tito and his role and legacy, as well as the tasks of the LCY in stopping and exposing these attacks.

The meeting also adopted a draft resolution on amendments and supplements to the LCY Charter, a draft decision on the establishment of the LCY Central Committee Chairman, the creation of its political executive body, and the extension of the term from 1 year to 2 years.

　　南共盟28中全会继续举行
　　强调必须制止和揭露对铁托的攻击
    本报贝尔格莱德10月27日电　记者严正报道：南共盟28中全会在中断一周后今天举行续会，第一个议程是讨论南共盟主席团就当前存在的对铁托的人身、作用及其事业进行攻击的政治思想实质所持的原则立场，以及共盟成员为击退和揭露这种攻击所肩负的任务。
    南共盟中央主席团主席米·潘切夫斯基在报告中指出，某些人从铁托的生活和事业中，居心叵测地寻找或曲解各种非重要的东西，以此败坏他的声誉，从而败坏南共盟在他的领导下所进行的一切事业；他们从民族主义的反社会主义和反共的立场出发，进行所谓自由地批判性地重新审查铁托的作用和事业，其目的越来越清楚，不只是为了攻击和否定铁托个人，而是为了攻击和否定南斯拉夫的人民解放战争、革命、南斯拉夫赖以立国的反法西斯人民解放委员会制定的原则基础、南各族人民的团结友爱和平等、联邦制度、共盟的作用以及南社会主义自治的社会制度。
    潘切夫斯基认为，铁托和南共始终存在着自己的政治反对派，因此今天对铁托的攻击并不感到意外，但令人担忧的是南共盟和整个社会没有能够采取及时的合理的行动对此作出回答，而某些共盟成员也对铁托的事业进行了非原则的批评甚至攻击。他说再也不能允许这种情况继续出现在南共盟和其它自治的社会主义力量面前。
    在今天的会议上，有24名中央委员发了言。
    会议一致通过了关于攻击铁托及其作用和事业的思想政治实质以及共盟在制止和揭露这种攻击方面的任务的决议。
    在今天会议上还通过了关于南共盟章程修改和补充的草案，关于设立南共盟中央主席、建立其政治执行机构以及任期从1年延长到2年的决定草案。
