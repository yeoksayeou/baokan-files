Recently, various regions have been following the instructions of the Party Central Committee to do several practical things for the people. Some have made plans, some are implementing them, and some have already seen results. The glorious tradition of "The Communist Party toils for the nation" and "The people's government serves the people" is being carried forward. The people are naturally pleased with these efforts. However, there are still some places where the principle of "say what you mean and mean what you say to gain the trust of the people" is not fully realized.

To follow through on promises, one must first "say what you mean," that is, plan which practical things to do. Doing practical things means solving real problems. Every region and unit has many things that need to be done, but which things need to be done first? This requires starting from reality and listening to the people's voices. Generally speaking, matters that affect the national economy and people's livelihood, matters that affect stability and unity, matters that affect production development, and matters that affect the prestige of the Party and the government—these are the "hot" issues, important issues, and issues that the people care about, and these should be addressed first.

Once you have said what you mean, you must follow through. The people look at actual results. No matter how eloquently you speak, if there is no action or if the effort is half-hearted and abandoned midway, it will inevitably lead to criticism from the people. "Following through" is actually a very arduous task. It involves policy and legal issues, as well as issues of manpower and financial resources; it involves issues of resolve, perseverance, and enthusiasm, as well as issues of organizational ability and leadership artistry. Whether or not one can follow through on promises is a direct assessment of the performance of leading organs and leading cadres. Those who are like street performers—all talk and no action—are they just putting on a show for others to see? Are they afraid that some thorny issues will fall on their own heads?

To facilitate following through on promises, various regions should promptly publicize the practical things they are doing, the progress of these things, and the results, so that the people can supervise and support them and gain their understanding.

### 说到就要做到

　　说到就要做到
    最近一个时期，各地根据党中央指示精神，正在为群众做几件实事。有的做了规划，有的正在实施，有的已见成效。“共产党辛劳为民族”、“人民政府为人民”的光荣传统得到发扬。对这些，老百姓自然高兴。但也有些地方在“说到做到，取信于民”方面仍不尽如人意。
    说到就要做到，首先是要“说到”，即要办哪几件实事，要有计划。办实事就是要解决实际问题。每个地区、单位需要办的事太多了，但哪些事需要先办，这就要从实际出发，倾听群众呼声。一般说来，那些关系着国计民生、群众切身利益的事情，关系着安定团结、稳定大局的事情，关系着发展生产的事情，关系着党和政府威信的事情，也就是“热点”问题、重要问题和群众关心的问题，先要办。
    说到了，就要做到。人民群众是看实际的。不管你说得怎样天花乱坠，如不见行动，或虎头蛇尾、半途而废，必然引起群众的非议。“做到”，实际上是很艰巨的事情。这里边既有政策、法律问题，又有人力、财力问题；既有决心、毅力、干劲问题，又有组织才能、领导艺术问题。能不能说到做到，这是对领导机关和领导干部直接的实绩考核。那种“天桥的把式——光说不练”的行为，是不是只想作个姿态给人看？是不是怕有些棘手问题搞到自己头上？
    为了有利于说到做到，各地要把所办的实事、办的进度、办的结果，及时向群众公布，以便于群众监督，并取得群众的支持和理解。
