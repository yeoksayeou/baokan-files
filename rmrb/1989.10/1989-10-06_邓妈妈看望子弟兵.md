Xinhua News Agency, October 5th

On October 5th, Tiananmen Square was still adorned with colorful flags and blooming flowers. Deng Yingchao, at the age of 85, came to Tiananmen Square in the cool breeze to warmly visit and comfort the soldiers of a certain unit who were on duty for the martial law, encouraging them to contribute to the stability and unity of socialist China and to the modernization of the motherland.

At 11:30 AM, Deng Mama arrived at the square. After getting out of the car, she enthusiastically greeted the officers and soldiers on duty: "Comrades, hello! You've worked hard!" She continued, "The 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation made me very happy. I also miss the martial law troops very much. Today, I came to see you all and to see the square." She said, "You have made great contributions to suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The people thank you, and the republic thanks you." Then, she turned to the officers and soldiers present and said, "Please convey my greetings to all the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops." After speaking, she smiled warmly and shook hands with everyone.

Deng Mama came to the Monument to the People's Heroes and gazed at it for a long time. Then, she suggested taking a group photo with the officers and soldiers on duty. When Deng Mama was about to take off her hat, the deputy political instructor, Major Zhang Yu'an, said, "Deng Mama, it's windy and cold here, you don't need to take off your hat." She replied, "It's fine, no problem." She insisted on taking off her hat and posed for a photo with the soldiers. At that moment, two more soldiers joyfully rushed over. Deng Mama smiled and beckoned to the two soldiers, "Come, come, let's take another photo."

Soon, the crowd watching flowers on the square saw Deng Mama and rushed over, enthusiastically shaking hands and greeting her: "Deng Mama, hello!" "Wish Deng Mama good health!" "Deng Grandma, wish you longevity!" Deng Mama continuously waved to the crowd, saying, "Hello everyone! Hello everyone!" She took the microphone and said excitedly, "Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China. We must unite around the Party Central Committee and build our socialist motherland even better!"

    邓妈妈看望子弟兵
    新华社通讯员　吴子敬　李全茂
    10月5日，天安门广场依然彩旗飘扬，百花竞放。85岁高龄的邓颖超妈妈迎着习习凉风来到天安门广场，亲切看望和慰问在这里执行戒严任务的某部指战员，勉励大家为社会主义祖国的安定团结，为祖国的四化建设再立新功。
    上午11点半，邓妈妈来到广场。下车后，她就热情地向正在执勤的干部战士打招呼：“同志们好，同志们辛苦了！”她接着说：“建国40周年大庆，我心里特别高兴，也特别想念戒严部队，今天来看看你们，看看广场。”她说：“你们为平息反革命暴乱作出了很大的贡献，人民感谢你们，共和国感谢你们。”接着，她又对在场的干部战士说：“请你们转达我向戒严部队全体官兵的问候。”说完，她满面春风地同大家一一握手。
    邓妈妈来到人民英雄纪念碑前，久久地凝视。然后，她提议同正在执勤的干部战士一起照相留念。邓妈妈正要脱去帽子，少校教导员常玉安说：“邓妈妈，这里风大天凉，帽子就不要脱了。”她说：“不怕，没关系。”她执意脱去帽子，和指战员一起合了影。这时又有两名战士十分喜悦地赶过来。邓妈妈又微笑着招呼两个战士说：“快来，快来，再照一张。”
    不久，正在广场观花的群众看到邓妈妈，纷纷涌来，热情地向她老人家握手、问候：“邓妈妈好！”“祝邓妈妈身体健康！”“邓奶奶，祝你长寿！”邓妈妈不断向群众招手说：“大家好！大家好！”她接过话筒激动地说：“没有共产党就没有新中国，我们要团结在党中央周围，把社会主义祖国建设得更好！”
