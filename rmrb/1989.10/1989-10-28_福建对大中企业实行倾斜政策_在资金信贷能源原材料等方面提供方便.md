People's Daily, Fuzhou, October 27th - Correspondent Zhang Mingqing reports: To address the current difficulties faced by large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, the Fujian Provincial Government has decided to implement inclination policies in the areas of funds, credit, energy, raw materials, and investment. Sixteen regulations have been made to support the development of these enterprises.

In terms of credit fund allocation, 20% to 25% of the total industrial and commercial credit funds in the province will be allocated specifically to designated enterprises. Banks will prioritize the allocation of normal operating funds for these enterprises, and will issue loan quotas for raw and auxiliary materials needed for mandatory production orders. Priority will be given to loan projects for technological upgrades. Key enterprises, upon approval by the bank, can engage in fund borrowing to develop short-term financial markets. The operating funds for key enterprises will be re-evaluated, and any shortfalls will be supplemented from the enterprise's development fund, with 10% to 30% allocated annually.

The planning and material departments will allocate the main raw and auxiliary material quotas for mandatory plan products to key enterprises, and settle payments based on actual supply quantities. Enterprises that produce products using negotiated raw materials can also negotiate the sale of these products. The Provincial Material Bureau will allocate 50% of the development fund annually to establish a material supply base, prioritizing the supply to key enterprises. Key enterprises can organize the procurement of planned raw and auxiliary materials, non-planned scarce materials, and the sale of accumulated products through individual contract methods, with rewards and penalties based on contract terms. Key enterprises using off-peak electricity can deduct 40% of the price difference as subsidies for night shift facilities and employee allowances. The budget for the provincial enterprise potential and innovation transformation fund should allocate 50% to key enterprises. Key enterprises can set aside 0.3% of their sales revenue as a new product development fund.

For several key large and medium-sized enterprises related to national and people's livelihoods, a separate planning system will be implemented, with planning indicators directly allocated to these enterprises. In the next round of contracting, key enterprises will retain all or most of the profits exceeding the base number, with 80% used for production development and debt repayment. Administrative departments and administrative companies will not be allowed to collect adjustment funds, management fees, etc., from the enterprises under their jurisdiction.

　　福建对大中企业实行倾斜政策
　　在资金信贷能源原材料等方面提供方便
    本报福州10月27日电　记者张铭清报道：针对目前大中型国营企业存在的困难，福建省政府决定在资金、信贷、能源、原材料、投资等方面实行倾斜政策，作出了扶持这些企业发展的16条规定。
    在信贷资金投向投量上，集中全省工交信贷总额20％至25％的资金专项用于定点企业。银行优先安排这些企业所需正常流动资金，戴帽下达生产指令性产品所需原辅材料的贷款指标，重点支持技改项目贷款。重点企业经银行批准可开展资金拆借，发展短期资金市场。对重点企业的生产流动资金重新核定，不足部分，企业应从生产发展基金中每年提取10％至30％自行补充。
    计划、物资部门对指令性计划的产品，将主要原辅材料计划指标戴帽落实到重点企业，并按实际供货量及时结算。重点企业用议价购进的原材料生产的产品，允许议进议出。省物资厅要从生产发展基金中每年划出50％，专项用于建立物资供应基地，优先供给重点企业。重点企业供销人员组织计划内原辅材料、计划外紧缺物资，以及推销积压产品，可采取单项承包办法，按合同奖罚规定兑现。重点企业凡使用低谷电的费用差价可提取40％作为夜班辅助设施和职工补贴。省企业挖潜革新改造资金预算应划出50％用于重点企业。重点企业可在销售收入中提取3‰作为新产品开发基金。
    对关系到国计民生的若干大中型重点企业，实行计划单列，将计划指标直接下达到这些企业。重点企业在新一轮承包中，超基数利润全部或大部留在企业，其中80％用于发展生产和还贷。企业主管部门和行政性公司不得向所辖企业收取调剂基金、管理费用等。
