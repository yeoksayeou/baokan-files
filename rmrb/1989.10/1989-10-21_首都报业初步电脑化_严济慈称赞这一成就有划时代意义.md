Beijing's newspaper industry has achieved initial computerization. Today, relevant personnel from major newspapers and publishing houses in the capital gathered to summarize and exchange experiences in this area.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Jian Jicong, spoke at the meeting, praising the computerization of Beijing's newspaper industry as a major technological achievement with epoch-making significance in the history of Chinese character technology.

Western countries achieved newspaper computerization as early as the 1970s. Some Western experts and scholars had believed that it was impossible to input complex Chinese characters into computers as efficiently as Western alphabetic characters. Some even claimed: "Without abolishing Chinese characters, China cannot enter the information age."

Chinese experts, including national labor model Wang Yongmin, made strenuous efforts and solved this "world problem" in less than 10 years. Now, major newspapers in the capital, including People's Daily (last four pages), Economic Daily, Guangming Daily, PLA Daily, Science and Technology Daily, and National Defense Industry Press, have adopted Wang Yongmin's invention, the "Wubi" Chinese character input method, as well as some domestically produced computer typesetting, laser plate-making, and offset printing technologies. Each operator can input 40,000 to 50,000 Chinese characters per day, making typesetting and revisions very convenient.

It is reported that Singapore's Chinese-language newspaper industry has decided to achieve computerization by 1991 and will uniformly adopt China's "Wubi" technology.

### 首都报业初步电脑化  严济慈称赞这一成就有划时代意义

　　首都报业初步电脑化
　　严济慈称赞这一成就有划时代意义
    本报北京10月20日讯　记者何黄彪报道：首都各主要报社和出版社已经基本上革除了铅字排版工艺，初步实现了报纸编排出版电脑化。今天，首都各报社的有关人员聚集一堂，总结交流了这方面的经验。
    全国人大常委会副委员长严济慈在座谈会上讲话，称赞首都报业电脑化是一项重大科技成就，在中国文字技术史上具有划时代的意义。
    西方国家早在70年代就实现了报业电脑化。西方一些专家学者曾认为，要使复杂的方块汉字像西方拼音文字那样高效地输入电脑根本不可能。有人甚至断言：“不废除汉字，中国就无法进入信息时代”。
    中国专家、全国劳模王永民等发奋努力，在不到10年的时间里解决了这个“世界难题”。现在首都各大报社，包括人民日报（后四版）、经济日报、光明日报、解放军报、科技日报以及国防工业出版社等单位，都采用了王永民发明的“五笔字型”汉字输入技术和一些国产的电脑组版、激光制版和胶版印刷的崭新工艺。每个操作员每天可输入汉字四五万个，组版改版非常方便。
    据悉，新加坡华文报业已决定要在1991年实现电脑化，并统一采用中国的“五笔字型”技术。
