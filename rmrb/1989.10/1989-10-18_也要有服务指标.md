	Service Standards Are Also Needed
	Li Gang

	During a visit to the countryside, it was discovered that in some villages, the job responsibility system for village cadres only includes "hard" targets such as collecting grain and various taxes and fees from farmers (which farmers call "demanding money" and "demanding grain"), with no or very few service targets such as purchasing fertilizer for farmers, delivering pesticides, and doing practical work. Will farmers welcome such a "responsibility system"?

	It is understood that some village cadres have a one-sided view, believing that "demanding money" and "demanding grain" are tangible and can be seen and touched, completing these targets can add to their achievements and earn more bonuses, while service work is a thankless job. Moreover, upper-level evaluations of cadres are mainly based on money and grain, these "hard" targets! In this way, they spend all day thinking about how to "demand money" and "demand grain" from farmers. As for the various actual difficulties farmers face, such as lack of fertilizer and electricity, they either ignore them, pretend they don't exist, or pass the buck, dealing with them superficially. When "demanding money" and "demanding grain," they are as urgent as fire, wearing out their iron shoes, but when farmers ask for help with their actual problems, they are left calling out to heaven and earth with no response.

	Doing a good job in service work, ensuring that farmers have sufficient materials, funds, and technical support for their production, is the foundation and prerequisite for completing money and grain targets. If our village cadres only focus on taking from farmers without paying attention to serving them, then not only will the task of delivering money and grain be difficult to complete, but it will also seriously affect the relationship between the government and the farmers. Therefore, it is very necessary to add service targets for farmers in the job responsibility system for village cadres, and these should be "hard" targets that are easy to supervise and inspect.

    也要有服务指标
    李钢
    下乡采访，了解到一些乡村干部订的岗位责任制中，只有向农民征收粮食和各种税、费（农民称为“要钱”、“要粮”）等“硬”指标，没有或很少有给农民购化肥、送农药、办实事等服务指标。对这样的“责任制”，农民会欢迎吗？
    据了解，某些乡村干部片面地认为，“要钱”、“要粮”看得见、摸得着，完成了这些指标可以增添政绩，多拿奖金，而服务工作则是吃力不讨好的事。何况，上级考核干部也主要是看钱粮等“硬”指标呢！这样一来，他们便整天琢磨如何从农民那里“要钱”、“要粮”，至于农民缺肥少电等种种实际困难，或不闻不问，置若罔闻；或推诿搪塞，敷衍了事。“要钱”、“要粮”时，急如星火，铁鞋磨破，而农民要求解决实际问题时，则喊天不应，叫地不灵。
    搞好服务工作，使农民的生产有足够的物资、资金和技术保证，是完成钱粮等指标的基础和先决条件。我们的乡村干部，如果只顾向农民索取，而不注意为农民服务，那么不但上缴钱、粮的任务难于完成，而且会严重影响政府与农民的关系。因此，在乡村干部的岗位责任制中很有必要加上为农民服务的指标，而且应当是便于监督和检查的“硬”指标。
