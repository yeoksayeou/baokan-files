The Chinese women's volleyball team, with a new lineup, successfully defended their title at the Asian Women's Volleyball Championship. The team, which had previously beaten South Korea and Japan, won the final match against South Korea with a score of 3-0, securing their third championship in the tournament's history.

The match, held at the Elizabeth Sports Arena in Hong Kong, was the climax of the fifth Asian Women's Volleyball Championship. The arena was packed with spectators eager to witness the showdown between the two powerhouses. The Chinese team fielded their strongest lineup: Li Guojun (No. 2), Wu Dan (No. 12), Li Yueling (No. 15), Su Huijuan (No. 7), Lai Yawen (No. 1), and Xu Xin (No. 10).

The first set was intense from the start. South Korea, fresh from their victory over Japan, played aggressively. Both teams seized every scoring opportunity. China took an early lead with a 7-2 advantage, but South Korea fought back to narrow the gap to 4 points. The Chinese team, with a mix of veteran and new players, played cohesively and aggressively, securing the first set 15-7.

In the second set, China continued their momentum. South Korea struggled to keep up, falling behind 1-10. Despite frequent adjustments by their coach, South Korea could not turn the tide and lost the set 1-15.

The third set started with China trailing 0-3, but they quickly took control, tying the score at 3-3. The battle intensified, with both teams fighting for every point. The score reached 9-9 before China switched to a more flexible strategy, taking the lead and ultimately winning the set 15-10.

Coach Hu Jin praised the team's performance, noting that today's match was their best of the tournament. He acknowledged that the players were initially nervous but relaxed and played more confidently as the match progressed. The key to victory, he said, was their dominance at the net. All six players performed well, with Wu Dan and Li Guojun standing out. He also mentioned that the team is still young and has room for improvement in defense and overall coordination.

Hu Jin expressed confidence that this victory will boost the team's morale for the upcoming World Cup in November, where they will face tough opponents like the Soviet Union and Cuba. He vowed that the team will give their best to compete for the top spot.

In another match, Chinese Taipei lost to Japan 1-3, securing fourth place. The scores were 15-8, 9-15, 4-15, and 4-15. Japan took third place.

    新阵容  新起点
    中国女排蝉联亚洲冠军
    本报香港10月8日电　记者连锦添报道：昨天轻易打赢日本队的南朝鲜女排，今晚败在中国姑娘手下。中国队以3∶0赢得这场比赛，蝉联亚洲女排锦标赛冠军，新阵容保住了亚洲女排盟主地位。
    这是中国女排新组队以来首次与南朝鲜队对阵，第五届亚洲女排锦标赛的压轴戏，香港伊利沙伯体育馆因而座无虚席。中国队今晚出场的一直为最强阵容，即2号李国君、12号巫丹、15号李月明、7号苏惠娟、1号赖亚文、10号许新。比赛一开始就十分激烈，南朝鲜队挟昨日轻取日本队的余威，打得很拚命。对于扣杀机会，双方一点都不放过。第一局中国队网前攻得紧，后排守得严，先以7∶2领先。对方顽强追上4分。中国队上阵的新老队员配合较好，且放开扣杀，以15∶7拿下第一局。
    第二局，中国队乘胜发挥。南朝鲜队似乎还未反应过来，比分表已是1∶10，教练急得跳脚，频频调整部署，仍无济于事，终以1∶15大败。在关键的第三局，中国队开始是0∶3落后，但迅即控制局面，追成3平。此后网上争夺激化，场上险象环生，比分涨到9平。中国队改打灵活球，掌握场上主动，最后李月明瞅准机会一击，比分跳至15∶10。中国队夺得冠军。这是继1979年和1987年后，中国队第三次在亚洲锦标赛夺冠。
    中国队教练胡进赛后表示，几场比赛中今天是打得最好的。队员们起初稍紧张，后来放松一些，发挥得比较主动。决胜的关键是在网上。6个人的表现都较令人满意，巫丹和李国君更突出。他说，队员们还比较年轻，技术仍显粗糙，防守和整体配合不尽理想。这次夺标为下月进军世界杯赛增加了信心，届时的对手中苏联、古巴队比我们强，但只要有可能，就要全力去争取。
    今晚，中国台北队以1∶3负于日本队，获第四名。比分为15∶8，9∶15，4∶15，4∶15。日本队获第三名。
