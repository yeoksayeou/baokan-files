China's largest agricultural research project—the Chinese Academy of Rice Research—was officially established today in the suburbs of Hangzhou. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun sent a congratulatory message on behalf of the State Council.

Minister of Agriculture He Kang, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee Li Zemin, and Director of the International Rice Research Institute Dr. Lampas attended the inauguration ceremony and cut the ribbon.

The Chinese Academy of Rice Research, with an investment of over 60 million yuan, received support from the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the International Rice Research Institute. The project imported advanced research equipment such as artificial climate chambers, automated greenhouse seed banks, and electronic computer systems. Many of the laboratories have reached the advanced level of the 1980s internationally.

During the construction phase, the Chinese Academy of Rice Research conducted a series of basic research and explorations in new technologies and high technologies in areas such as germplasm resources, genetic breeding, biotechnology, agronomy, plant protection, soil and plant nutrition, grain chemistry, agricultural engineering, and agricultural economics and planning. By 1989, it had promoted new varieties, new combinations, and new technologies over an area of 1 million hectares in the Yangtze River basin.

According to statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, from 1985 to 1987, China's rice planting area was the second largest in the world, total rice production was the highest in the world, and rice yield per unit area was 65% higher than the world average.

He Kang announced at the meeting: The State Science and Technology Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture have decided to raise funds to establish the Chinese Academy of Rice Research Fund to support domestic rice researchers to conduct specialized research at the Chinese Academy of Rice Research.

    本报杭州10月9日电  记者高海浩报道：我国最大的农业科研建设项目——中国水稻研究所，今天在杭州近郊落成。田纪云副总理代表国务院致信表示祝贺。
    农业部部长何康、浙江省委书记李泽民、国际水稻研究所所长兰帕博士为庆贺典礼剪彩。
    投资6000多万元的中国水稻研究所在建设中得到世界银行、联合国开发计划署、联合国粮农组织、洛克菲勒基金会和国际水稻研究所的支持，利用外资引进了人工气候箱群、自动温室种质库、电子计算机系统等一大批先进科研设备，许多实验室达到国际80年代先进水平。
    筹建过程中，中国水稻研究所从品种资源、遗传育种、生物工程、农艺、植保、土壤与植物营养、谷物化学、农业工程、农业经济与区划等方面，展开了一系列基础研究和新技术、高技术的探索。1989年已在长江流域推广新品种、新组合、新技术100万公顷。
    据联合国粮农组织统计，1985—1987年平均，中国的水稻种植面积居世界第2位，稻谷总产居世界第1位，稻谷单产比世界平均水平高65％。
    何康在会上宣布：国家科委和农业部决定筹措资金，设立中国水稻研究所基金，扶持国内水稻科研工作者到中国水稻研究所进行专门研究。
