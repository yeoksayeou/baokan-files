The governments of West Germany and Poland recently signed a debt conversion agreement in Bonn. The agreement allows the Polish government to defer the repayment of 2.5 billion marks in overdue debt. The agreement also stipulates that part of the loans due for repayment between 1986 and 1988 will be converted into long-term export credits and financial credits guaranteed by the West German Federal Government, while another portion of the loans will be postponed for repayment until after 1997. It is reported that Poland owes West Germany nearly 16 billion marks in total.

The signing of this agreement was originally planned for a few weeks earlier but was delayed due to political changes in Poland, causing negotiations between the two countries to be suspended. Since the Solidarity movement leader Mazowiecki took office as the new Prime Minister of Poland, negotiations between the two countries' envoys have resumed. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    西德波兰签订债务转换协定
    西德、波兰两国政府日前在波恩签订一项债务转换协定，同意波兰政府延期偿还已经到期的25亿马克的债务。协定还规定，部分应在1986至1988年偿还的贷款将转为由西德联邦政府提供担保的长期出口信贷和财政信贷，另一部分贷款推迟到1997年以后偿还。据悉，波兰共欠西德债务近160亿马克。
    这一协定原计划在几星期之前签订，因波兰政局变化两国谈判一度中断。自从“团结工会”人士马佐维耶茨基出任波兰新政府总理以后，两国特使的谈判才恢复。（据新华社）
