Retired workers quietly returning to the workforce

According to a sample survey of cities, approximately 3.6 million retired workers in China have returned to the workforce. In some large and medium-sized cities, retired workers who wish to return to work have formed a self-organized group in certain industries, and this trend is increasing year by year.

According to China's current regulations on the maximum age for the labor force, about 10 million cadres and workers retire from their posts each year. By the end of 1988, the number of retired workers nationwide had reached over 20 million. As the number of retired workers continues to grow, the number of those who wish to return to work is also increasing.

The phenomenon of retired workers returning to the workforce has quietly emerged in recent years. According to the sample survey of cities, in 1988, there were an average of 23.57 retired individuals per 100 urban households, of which 4.11 were re-employed or retained in the workforce, accounting for 17.4 per thousand of the total number of retired workers. Based on this, it is estimated that approximately 3.6 million retired workers have returned to the workforce nationwide.

Among all provinces and cities, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and cities along the Yangtze River have the highest number of retired workers returning to the workforce. The number is relatively lower in the southwestern and northwestern provinces and regions.

Experts believe that the return of retired workers to the workforce in China is due to the fact that many of them are in good health, have a relatively high level of education, and have rich work experience. They are in the second golden age of their intellectual development. Some retired workers seek re-employment to increase their income. According to a survey, the average monthly income of retired workers who had returned to the workforce in 1988 was 91.7 yuan, which played a positive role as a supplement to the "old-age security" system. Some retired workers also seek re-employment to alleviate the sense of emptiness that comes with retirement, to achieve psychological balance, and to enrich their spiritual lives.

　　离退休人员再就业悄然出现
    据城市抽样调查推算，我国约有三百六十万离退休人员再就业。在一些大中城市的某些行业，要求再就业的离退休人员自发地形成了一个群体，并呈逐年增加的趋势。
    按照我国现行劳动人口最高年龄界定线的规定，每年大约有一千万左右的干部、职工从工作岗位离休退休。到一九八八年末，全国离退休人员已达二千多万人。随着离退休人员的日益增加，有再就业意愿的人越来越多。
    离退休人员再就业是近几年悄然出现的新情况。据城市抽样调查，一九八八年平均每百户城镇居民家庭有离退休人口二十三点五七人，其中被聘用或留用再就业的离退休人员四点一一人，占离退休人员总数的千分之十七点四，据此推算，全国约有三百六十万离退休人员再就业。
    在全国各省、市中，以京、津、沪及长江沿海城市离退休人员再就业者居多。西南、西北省、区较少。
    有关专家认为，我国离退休人员再就业，是因为在离退休人员中，有不少人健康状况良好，受教育程度较高。有较丰富的工作经验，他们正是处于智力发展的第二黄金时代。一部分离退休人员寻觅再就业之路，为了增加收入。据调查，已再就业的离退休人员一九八八年每人平均每月收入九十一点七元，作为“老有所养”的一项补充起到了积极作用。还有一些离退休人员为消除因退休而来的空虚感，以求得心理平衡的过渡，充实精神生活。
