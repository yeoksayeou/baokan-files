In 1988, amidst the fierce competition in the Japanese cosmetics market, two new products emerged: "Pulan" Slimming Cream and "Pulan" Breast Enhancing Cream. The former helps those troubled by weight gain achieve a slim figure, while the latter helps women with flat chests become more shapely and beautiful. These two cosmetics caused a sensation in Japan as soon as they were introduced. Newspapers, magazines, and radio stations extensively reported on the effects and social reactions of "Pulan" among Japanese consumers, creating the image of a "Chinese Herbal Beauty" in the minds of the Japanese people.

Japan is a high-consumption market and also a relatively conservative one. The annual sales of cosmetics exceed 100 billion yen, with foreign cosmetics accounting for only 1% to 2%. The price of cosmetics in Japan is generally between 1,000 and 5,000 yen per bottle, with only 1% exceeding 10,000 yen. "Pulan" Slimming Cream is priced at 25,000 yen (approximately $200) per bottle, and Breast Enhancing Cream at 18,000 yen, with the export earnings of two bottles equaling the value of a color television, placing them among the high-end cosmetics in the international market.

In just five years, the Tianjin Cosmetics Technology Research Institute developed over 20 types of "Pulan" series cosmetics, which are popular in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, the United States, Italy, and several dozen countries and regions in Africa. In 1988, the institute's exports earned $6 million, and this year it is expected to exceed $10 million.

Seeing such remarkable achievements, people cannot help but ask, what is the secret behind their success? The institute's director, Shù Xiàoxiān, summarized it in two points: First, leverage China's rich cultural heritage and use modern technology to tap into traditional treasures. "Pulan" is derived from thousands of Chinese herbs, selecting and extracting those suitable for weight loss and breast enhancement, and then scientifically refining them. Second, capture accurate information and adapt to international trends to develop products. In some developed countries, affluent households often suffer from overnutrition and are very particular about body shape. Developing safe and effective slimming creams naturally attracts their attention.

Contrary to the development path of "Pulan," some places and enterprises, seeing the current market demand for certain products, rush to import foreign production lines, imitating others and following trends without innovation. As a result, their products struggle to enter the international market. The consequence of such hasty expansion is that many products become stagnant and accumulate in the domestic market, leading to forced reductions in production. These enterprises, lacking long-term strategic thinking, stumble around in the domestic market, unable to break through, and ultimately become the first to fail.

It seems that for Chinese products to secure a place in the highly competitive international market, they must develop products with unique characteristics and distinct personalities. The essence of these products lies in innovation. Only through innovation can products be created that stand out from the competition, achieving high profits and significant foreign exchange earnings. The facts have proven that Chinese scientists are capable of developing unique products.

    “中药美人”的启示
    李茜
    1988年，在世界各国化妆品竞争激烈的日本化妆品市场，闯进两个新鲜品种——“普兰娜”健美霜、“普兰娜”美乳霜，前者能使为发胖而烦恼的人变得身材苗条，后者能使乳房扁平的女性变得丰满健美。这两种化妆品刚一崭露头角，在日本就引起了轰动。一些报纸、杂志和电台用大量篇幅报道了“普兰娜”在日本消费者中使用的效果和社会反响，在日本人心目中塑造了“中药美人”的形象。
    日本是一个高消费市场，同时也是一个相当保守的市场，化妆品年销售额1兆亿日元以上，外国化妆品仅占1％至2％。日本市场上化妆品价格一般每瓶1000日元至5000日元，超过1万日元的仅占1％。普兰娜健美霜售价为2.5万日元（约相当200美元），美乳霜1.8万日元一瓶，两瓶化妆品创汇可抵一台彩电，已跻身于国际市场高档化妆品行列。
    天津化妆品科技研究所在短短的5年间，开发出“普兰娜”系列化妆品20多种，畅销于日本、南朝鲜、香港、新加坡、加拿大、美国、意大利和非洲等几十个国家和地区，1988年出口创汇600万美元，今年可达1000万美元以上。
    人们看到如此令人瞩目的成就，在欣喜、感奋之余，难免要问，他们的奥秘在哪里？研究所所长束效先概括为两点：一是发扬我国悠久的民族文化优势，用现代科技挖掘中国传统的宝藏。“普兰娜”就是从几千种中药里筛选、萃取适合减肥、美乳的药物，用科学方法精制而成。二是捕捉准确的信息，适应国际潮流开发产品。一些发达国家的富裕户，营养过剩，又极为讲究体形美，研制安全、有效的减肥霜，自然会受到欢迎。
    与“普兰娜”的发展道路相反，有些地方和企业看到眼下市场上一些产品紧俏，就一哄而上，竞相引进国外生产线，跟在别人后边照猫画虎，依样画葫芦，亦步亦趋，总是赶不上人家，产品很难打入国际市场。遍地开花的结果，不少产品在国内也滞销积压，又被迫一哄而下。这些缺乏长远战略思想的企业家，在国内市场的盘陀路上东碰西撞，总是杀不出去，最后只好当败旅之首。
    看来，我国产品要在强手如林的国际市场上争得一席之地，必须研制有特色、有鲜明个性的产品。这些产品的精髓在于创新，先有创新，才能生产出有别于他人的产品，取得高利润和高创汇。事实证明，我国科技人员是有能力开发有特色产品的。
