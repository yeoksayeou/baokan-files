Reporter Wang Yougong learned from the opening of the Third National Patent Work Conference held today that since the implementation of China's Patent Law in April 1985, a large number of patented technologies have been widely implemented, achieving significant economic benefits. According to a sample survey, the implementation rate of patented technologies and patent applications in China is 30%. According to statistics on more than 10,000 patent projects that have been implemented, the cumulative new output value is 12.93 billion yuan, the new tax revenue is 2.34 billion yuan, and the foreign exchange earnings are 140 million US dollars.

Emphasizing the implementation of patents is one of the characteristics of China's Patent Law. Over the past few years, various local and departmental authorities have taken measures such as establishing patent development funds, setting up and supporting patent technology development institutions, holding patent technology trade fairs, securing bank loans, and including the promotion and application of patent technologies in national and local plans to accelerate the conversion of scientific and technological achievements into productive forces. According to the analysis of more than 11,900 patent projects that have been implemented, the following characteristics are evident:

- The implementation rate of service inventions and creations is as high as 45.2%, which is three times that of non-service inventions and creations.
- The implementation rate of patented technologies and patent applications in industrial and mining enterprises is as high as 75.5%, and that in colleges and universities and research institutions is 43.4%, which is significantly higher than that of other units and individuals.
- Among the users of patented technologies, state-owned enterprises account for 69.8%, collectively-owned enterprises account for 24.9%, and township enterprises account for 3.2%.

State Councilor Song Jian, Director of the China Patent Office Gao Luolin, and others attended the meeting and spoke.

　　我国专利项目效益显赫
　　专利技术实施率达到30％
    本报北京10月29日讯　记者王友恭从今天在此开幕的第三次全国专利工作会议上获悉：自从1985年4月我国专利法实施以来，大批专利技术得到广泛实施，取得显著的经济效益。据抽样调查，我国专利技术和专利申请技术的实施率为30％。据对已实施的1万多个专利项目的统计，累积新增产值129.3亿元，新增利税23.4亿元，创汇1.4亿美元。
    强调专利的实施，是我国专利法的特点之一。几年来，各地方、各部门为加速科技成果转化为生产力的步伐，采取了诸如建立专利发展基金、设立和扶植专利技术开发机构、举办专利技术交易会、争取银行贷款，以及将专利技术的推广应用纳入国家、地方有关计划等措施。据对已实施的11900多个专利项目的分析，其构成有以下特点：
    ——职务发明创造的实施率高达45.2％，是非职务发明创造的3倍。
    ——工矿企业的专利技术和专利申请技术的实施率高达75.5％，大专院校和科研单位的实施率为43.4％，明显高于其它单位和个人。
    ——在专利技术的用户中，全民所有制单位占69.8％，集体所有制单位占24.9％，乡镇企业占3.2％。
    国务委员宋健、中国专利局局长高卢麟等出席会议并讲话。
