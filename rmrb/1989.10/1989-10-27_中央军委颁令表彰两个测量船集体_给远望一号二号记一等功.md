Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th.

The Central Military Commission recently issued an order to commend two measurement ship units, awarding the Far Horizon No. 1 and No. 2 ships a collective first-class merit citation.

The order, signed by Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping, states that China's ocean-going space tracking ships, Far Horizon No. 1 and No. 2, are two advanced units on the national defense science and technology front, known for their strong ideological and work styles, proficient technical skills, and outstanding achievements. They have carried forward the glorious traditions of hard struggle and revolutionary tenacity of the Chinese military, with a strong sense of responsibility to join the world and bring glory to the nation. United as one, they have braved hardships, cut through waves, and fought for 10 years. They have ventured into the Pacific Ocean seven times, conducted sea operations for nearly 900 days, and sailed over 100,000 nautical miles. They have successfully completed nine major state-level experiments, including sea-based tracking and control tasks for launching carrier rockets into the Pacific Ocean, submarine-launched carrier rockets, and communication satellites. They have ensured the safety of personnel, equipment, and ships, making significant contributions to China's national defense modernization and the development of the aerospace industry.

The Central Military Commission's order hopes that all officers and soldiers of the Far Horizon No. 1 and No. 2 measurement ships will carefully summarize their experiences, build on their achievements, and continue to strive. They should resolutely implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and make new contributions to strengthening the modernization and regularization of the revolutionary army and the development of China's aerospace industry.
