The largest poverty-stricken area in China—the central region of Gansu Province and the adjacent West Sea Gobi region of Ningxia—has made significant progress in economic development and poverty alleviation. The population that has long been unable to meet basic food needs has decreased from 75% to less than 15%, and 20% of the population has begun to achieve prosperity.

According to data provided at a recent meeting of the State Council's "Three West" region held in Ningxia, the central poverty-stricken area of Gansu Province, which includes 20 counties, has seen per capita grain availability increase from 152.5 kilograms in 1982 to 260 kilograms, and farmers' per capita net income has reached 380 yuan. In the 8 counties of Ningxia's West Sea Gobi region, per capita grain availability is over 240 kilograms, and per capita income is 210 yuan.

Reporters in this region observed that most households have livestock in their yards and haystacks in front of their doors. Both adults and children have smiles on their faces, and the former despair of struggling on the brink of starvation is rarely seen.

The 28 counties in the central region of Gansu and the West Sea Gobi region of Ningxia have a population of over 7 million agricultural workers who have long lived in poverty, relying on grain subsidies and financial aid. Since the 1970s, the state has had to subsidize this region with about 250 million kilograms of grain annually, resulting in a financial burden of over 100 million yuan. At the end of 1982, the State Council decided to prioritize the development and construction of the central region of Gansu, the commercial area of the Hexi Corridor, and the West Sea Gobi region of Ningxia (collectively known as the "Three West") as a key national agricultural regional development project. The state allocated 200 million yuan annually to support this effort, aiming to stabilize the food security of farmers within 10 years. After 7 years of construction, significant changes have been achieved.

	• Basic production conditions have improved. Located in the arid zone of the Loess Plateau, the 28 counties have developed water-based agriculture where water is available and dryland agriculture where it is not. In areas with water resources, large-scale irrigation projects have been implemented, creating new irrigation areas of tens of thousands of acres, with 770,000 acres of new irrigated land developed. This has increased the total irrigated land in the region to over 3.7 million acres, with an average of half an acre per person.

	• Regional economic development has begun to show results. In the past two years, this region has developed six major industries: starch, flax, livestock products, carpets, embroidery, and minerals. A few leading enterprises and industrial clusters have taken shape. This year, 560,000 people were sent out for labor services. The income from these two items reached 970 million yuan, averaging 128 yuan per person.

	• The ecological environment has started to transition to a positive cycle. The long-standing practices of deforestation, grassland destruction, and uncontrolled cultivation have stopped. After 7 years of effort, the total area of forests and grasslands has reached 27.5 million acres, and water and soil erosion in 13,960 square kilometers of land has been controlled. The increase in forests and grasslands has also promoted the development of animal husbandry, with livestock product income reaching 200 million yuan this year.

    十年扶贫规划　七年大见成效
    “三西”绝大多数农民已得温饱
    新华社银川10月18日电　（记者王漫沧）我国最大的贫困区——甘肃中部地区和毗连的宁夏西海固地区，经济开发和扶贫工作取得巨大成绩。长期不得温饱的人口已从过去的75％下降到15％以下，20％的人口开始走上富裕之路。
    据最近在宁夏召开的国务院“三西”地区工作会议提供的数据：目前，甘肃省中部贫困区20个县，人均占有粮食已由1982年的152.5公斤提高到260公斤，农民人均纯收入已达380元。宁夏西海固地区8县人均占有粮食240多公斤，人均收入达210元。
    记者在这一地区看到，大多数人家圈里有牲畜，门前有草垛，大人小孩脸上都有了笑容，昔日那种在饥饿线上挣扎的愁苦相很少见到了。
    甘肃中部和宁夏西海固地区共28县，有700多万农业人口长期过着“吃粮靠回销，花钱靠救济”的日子。从70年代以来，国家每年要为这一地区回销粮食2.5亿公斤左右，仅此一项财政负担就上亿元。1982年底，国务院决定将以定西为主的甘肃中部，河西走廊商品区和宁夏西海固（简称“三西”）列为全国农业区域性开发建设重点项目，每年由国家拨专款2亿元予以扶持，要求在10年内比较稳定地解决农民的温饱问题。7年建设现已取得了显著变化。
    ——生产基本条件得到改善。地处黄土高原干旱带的28县，“有水的地方走水路，没水的地方走旱路”。在有水利条件的地方大力发展水地，形成了一批万亩以至数十万亩的新灌区，新发展水浇地77万亩，使这一地区水浇地总面积达到370多万亩，人均半亩。
    ——区域经济开发已初见成效。最近两年，这一地区开展了淀粉、亚麻、畜产品、地毯、编绣、矿产品六大产业的系列开发，少数龙头骨干企业和产业群体已初具规模。今年劳务输出56万人。上述两项创收达9.7亿元，平均每人128元。
    ——生态环境开始向良性循环转化。这一地区持续了多年的毁林、铲草皮、乱开荒的现象停止了。经过7年的努力，林草面积累计已达2750万亩，13960平方公里土地的水土流失得到治理。林草的增加也促进了畜牧业的发展，今年的畜产品收入达2亿元。
