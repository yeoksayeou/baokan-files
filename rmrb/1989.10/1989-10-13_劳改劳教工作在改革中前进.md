Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor institutions, as an important tool of the people's democratic dictatorship, have faced new situations, boldly explored, and innovated. They have adjusted their strategies in a timely manner, set new goals, and gradually achieved a series of major transformations. The reform and re-education work has made breakthrough developments, adapting to the needs of China's socialist modernization, and fully embodying the great Marxist thought of "transforming society and transforming people" in the new era of reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor work.

According to incomplete statistics, over the past decade, reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor units across the country have detained, held, and reformed more than 2 million criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals, of whom more than 1 million have returned to society. The escape rate of criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals, as well as the crime rate within the institutions, has significantly decreased. The proportion of criminals receiving sentence reductions and parole has increased by nearly threefold. More than 500 reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor units have become special schools for educating and reforming people, with a noticeable improvement in reform quality and a significant reduction in recidivism. The industrial and agricultural production of reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor units has rapidly developed, with the total output value increasing by nearly onefold.

In terms of legal administration within the institutions, the transition from incomplete legal systems to complete legal systems has been achieved.

Reform-through-labor institutions are specialized agencies in China for the execution of criminal penalties. Every aspect of their work, such as detention, supervision, appeals, and release upon completion of sentences, must have strict legal procedures and be carried out in accordance with the law. In the past, due to incomplete legal systems or the lack of necessary supervision and guarantee measures, even when legal regulations existed, enforcement was often not strict, leading to many loopholes that affected the fairness and seriousness of law enforcement. With the strengthening of the country's legal system, China's prison administration regulations have begun to be strengthened and improved. A series of regulations, rules, and systems have been established to ensure the execution of criminal penalties, gradually bringing various aspects of work under the rule of law. Given that the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Reform Through Labor" enacted in 1954 are no longer suitable for the new situation, in recent years, we have organized efforts to draft legislation on the supervision and reform of criminals based on the summary of 30 years of supervision and reform work experience and the borrowing and absorption of foreign prison administration experience. Re-education through labor is an administrative measure that must also be strictly carried out in accordance with the law. In recent years, the rules and regulations for re-education through labor have gradually been improved, and the draft of the re-education through labor law is being accelerated.

In terms of the reform objects, the focus has shifted from primarily reforming historical counter-revolutionaries to primarily reforming general criminal offenders.

In the 1950s and 1960s, to defend and consolidate the young People's Republic, a large number of historical criminals who had committed crimes and were hostile to socialist New China, as well as war criminals, were subjected to reform through labor. China's reform-through-labor institutions, while punishing them, carried out arduous and meticulous educational reform work, transforming the majority of them into new people, known as a "miracle on earth." Entering the 1970s and 1980s, the objects of reform changed significantly, with historical counter-revolutionaries making up a very small proportion and general criminal offenders making up the vast majority, mostly young people. They differ significantly from historical counter-revolutionaries in terms of psychology, ideology, behavior, and other aspects, exhibiting clear characteristics of the times. The vast majority of them were influenced by bourgeois decadent ideology, with selfishness running rampant, spiritual emptiness, laziness, weak legal awareness, and low moral standards, leading them to commit crimes. In their crimes, they exhibited impulsiveness, suddenness, and even cruelty, but also had active thinking, extroverted personalities, and strong malleability, making them relatively easy to reform. As long as they are guided properly, the vast majority can be reformed. Based on these new changes and characteristics, reform-through-labor work should emphasize the principle of "reform first, production second," placing educational reform at the forefront of all work. Re-education-through-labor work firmly implements the principle of education, persuasion, and rescue, focusing on rescue. In terms of management, efforts are made to change concepts and correct simple and rough methods, replacing them with strict, civilized, scientific management, and patient, meticulous, and targeted educational reform.

In terms of management, the transition from experience-based to standardized and scientific management has been achieved.

In recent years, reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor units have implemented the principles of legal, strict, civilized, scientific, and direct management. They have fully promoted the target management responsibility system, with both short-term and long-term goals for prison administration, educational reform, and living hygiene, with each task assigned to specific individuals. Especially for criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals, a 100% assessment system has been implemented, with rewards based on points and sentence reductions and parole in accordance with the law. In terms of education, the previous fragmented approach has been changed. Since 1984, when reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor units established special schools, they have rapidly moved towards systematization and standardization, adhering to the core of education based on the Four Cardinal Principles and legal education, with vocational and technical education as the focus and cultural education as the foundation. To prevent the spread of negative influences among criminals, the effectiveness, scientific nature, and targeted nature of education have been improved through tiered management and classified teaching, achieving noticeable results.

In terms of educational reform, the transition from the previous closed-institution educational reform to an open approach, with the institution as the main focus and the mobilization of social forces for joint educational reform, has been achieved.

Driven by reform and opening up, prisons and re-education-through-labor institutions have proposed that reform work should extend forward, outward, and backward, increasing social understanding and support for reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor work, and mobilizing various social forces to carry out multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form educational and guidance activities for criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals. In recent years, institutions and re-education-through-labor units have signed educational guidance agreements with relevant social departments. They have invited officials from various levels of party and government agencies, relevant departments, social figures, and model heroes to visit and guide the institutions, deliver speeches, and help solve practical difficulties and problems. They have organized the families of criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals to visit the institutions with specific purposes, providing guidance to criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals. They have invited reformed individuals to return to their original units to share their reform experiences and organized criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals to visit and learn about the achievements of socialist construction outside the institutions. Currently, 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have labor reform bureaus, and more than 400 labor reform units and more than 100 re-education-through-labor units have signed joint educational guidance agreements with local governments and relevant departments and units, totaling more than 100,000 agreements, involving more than 200,000 criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals. Nearly 10,000 educational guidance activities have been carried out, initially forming a situation of comprehensive management inside and outside the walls.

In terms of reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor production, the transition from a product economy to a planned commodity economy has been achieved.

Among criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals, a significant portion were influenced by certain decadent ideas in society and became involved in illegal activities due to laziness. Therefore, organizing them to participate in production labor is very necessary. First, through labor, their ideological reform can be promoted, bad habits can be changed, a sense of labor and organizational discipline can be established, and necessary labor skills can be learned, creating favorable conditions for their return to society. Second, organizing criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals with labor capacity to engage in production labor can reduce the financial burden on the state. When organizing criminals and re-education-through-labor individuals to engage in production labor, they are not treated as forced labor or cheap labor, but with clear correctional purposes, reasonable plans, civilized management, appropriate labor intensity, and necessary safety protection measures. In recent years, during China's transition from a product economy to a planned commodity economy, the reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor economy has adapted to these changes, significantly developing production. In terms of production scale and management, there have been considerable expansions and improvements. Large amounts of investment have been made to renovate and expand more than 600 reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor industrial and agricultural production units, and new production projects have been established. Especially with the implementation of the "dual contract responsibility system for reform and production," a new path for the management of reform-through-labor and re-education-through-labor enterprises has been opened. Production capacity and management levels have rapidly improved, with industrial and agricultural output values significantly increasing. A number of advanced enterprises and famous and high-quality products have emerged, including 24 national second-level enterprises, 32 provincial advanced enterprises, 36 national-level excellent products, and more than 300 department-level and provincial-level excellent products.

    劳改劳教工作在改革中前进
    司法部副部长　金鉴
    党的十一届三中全会以来，作为人民民主专政重要工具之一的劳改、劳教机关，面对新形势，大胆探索，锐意创新，及时调整对策，制定新的目标，逐步实现了一系列重大转变，改造工作有了突破性发展，适应了我国社会主义现代化建设的需要，使马克思主义关于“改造社会，改造人”的伟大思想在新时期劳改、劳教工作中得到充分体现。
    据不完全统计，十年来，全国劳改、劳教单位共收押、收容、改造犯人和劳教人员200多万，其中100多万已返回社会。犯人、劳教人员脱逃率、狱所内发案率大幅度下降，犯人减刑、假释比例增加了近3倍，有500多个劳改、劳教单位办成了教育人改造人的特殊学校，改造质量明显提高，重新违法犯罪率显著下降，劳改、劳教工农业生产迅速发展，总产值增长了近一倍。
    在依法治监治所上，由法制不完备逐步向法制完备转变
    劳改机关是我国执行刑罚的专门机关，其每项工作，如收押、监管、申诉以及刑满释放等等，都应有严格的法律规定程序，必须依法进行，按章办事。过去由于法制不够完备，或者虽有法律规定，但缺乏必要的监督保障措施，往往执法不够严格，出现了许多漏洞，影响了执法的公正性和严肃性。随着国家法制建设的加强，我国狱政法规开始得到加强和完善，制定了一系列保证刑罚执行的法规、规定和制度，使各项工作逐步纳入法制的轨道。鉴于1954年制定的《中华人民共和国劳动改造条例》已难于适应新形势的需要，近年来，我们又组织力量，在总结前30年监管改造工作经验和借鉴、吸收外国狱政管理经验的基础上，加快起草监管改造罪犯立法。劳动教养是一项强制性的行政措施，也必须严格依法进行，近几年来，劳教工作的规章、制度逐步完善，劳教法也在加快起草。
    在改造对象上，由以改造历史反革命罪犯为主转变为以改造一般刑事违法犯罪人员为主
    五六十年代，为保卫和巩固年轻的共和国，大批历史上犯有罪行，敌视社会主义新中国的反革命分子以及战争罪犯被投入劳动改造。我国劳改机关在对他们进行惩罚的同时，对他们进行了艰苦、细致的教育改造工作，把他们中的大多数改造成为新人，被称为“人间奇迹”。进入七、八十年代以后，改造对象发生了很大的变化，反革命罪犯占极少数，一般的刑事罪犯占绝大多数，而且主要是年轻人。他们在心理、思想、行为等方面都与过去历史反革命罪犯有很大不同，带有明显的时代特征。他们当中的绝大多数是受资产阶级腐朽思想影响，利己主义恶性膨胀，精神空虚，好逸恶劳，法制观念淡漠，道德水准低下而走向犯罪的。他们在犯罪中表现出盲动性、突发性甚至残忍性，同时又有思想活跃、性格外向、可塑性较强等易于改造的一面。只要把握引导得好，绝大多数是可以改造好的。根据这些新的变化和特点，劳改工作更要强调“改造第一，生产第二”的方针，把教育改造放在一切工作的首位；劳教工作坚决实行教育、感化、挽救的方针，着眼于挽救。在管教上，努力转变观念，随时纠正简单、粗暴的做法，代之以严格、文明、科学的管理和耐心、细致、有针对性的教育改造。
    在管理上，由经验型逐步向规范化、科学化转变
    近几年，劳改、劳教单位实行了依法、严格、文明、科学、直接管理的原则；全面推行了目标管理责任制，无论是狱政管理、教育改造、生活卫生，都有近期和远期目标，每项工作都落实到人，特别是对犯人和劳教人员实行了百分考核制，以分计奖，依法减刑、减期。在教育方面，也改变了过去零敲碎打的状况，自1984年劳改、劳教单位创办特殊学校以来，迅速走向系统化、正规化，坚持以四项基本原则教育和法制教育为核心，以职业技术教育为重点，以文化教育为基础。为防止犯人之间交叉感染，提高教育的针对性、科学性和有效性，实行分级管理，分类施教，取得了明显的成效。
    在教育改造上，由过去基本封闭式的狱所内教育改造转变为开放式的、以狱所内为主，动员社会力量共同进行教育改造
    在改革开放的推动下，监狱、劳教所提出了改造工作要向前、向外、向后延伸，增加社会对劳改、劳教工作的理解和支持，动员社会各方面力量，对犯人、劳教人员开展多层次、多渠道、多种形式的帮教活动。这几年来，监所和劳教单位与社会有关部门签订帮教协议；邀请各级党政机关、有关部门、社会知名人士、英雄模范人物到监所视察指导、作报告，帮助解决实际困难和问题；有目的地组织犯人、劳教人员家属到监所参观，对犯人、劳教人员进行规劝；请改造好的典型回原单位谈改造体会；组织犯人、劳教人员走出监所，参观、了解社会主义建设成就等等。目前已有20个省、市、自治区劳改局和400多个劳改单位，100多个劳教单位与当地政府、有关部门、单位签订了联合帮教协议，累计达10万多份，纳入帮教协议的犯人、劳教人员20多万，开展帮教活动近万次，初步形成了大墙内外，齐抓共管，综合治理的局面。
    在劳改、劳教生产上，由产品经济向有计划的商品经济转变
    在犯人和劳教人员中，有很大一部分是由于好逸恶劳以及受社会上某些腐朽思想影响而走上违法犯罪道路的。因此，组织他们参加生产劳动是非常必要的。一是通过劳动，能够促使其思想改造，改掉恶习，树立劳动观念和组织纪律观念，学会必要的劳动技能，为他们重返社会创造有利条件；二是组织有劳动能力的犯人和劳教人员进行生产劳动，可以减轻国家财政负担。在组织犯人、劳教人员生产劳动时，不是把他们当作苦役或廉价的劳动力，而是有明确的矫治目的，合理的计划，文明的管理，适度的劳动强度以及必要的安全保护措施。近几年来，在我国由产品经济向有计划的商品经济的转轨中，劳改、劳教经济适应这种变化，使生产得到了很大发展。在生产规模、经营管理等方面都有了相当的扩大和改善，先后大量投资，对600多个劳改、劳教工农业生产单位进行了技术改造和扩建，新建了一批生产项目。特别是推行了“改造、生产双承包责任制”，走出了一条劳改、劳教企业管理的新路子。生产能力和管理水平迅速提高，工农业产值大幅度增长，还涌现出一批先进企业和创出了一批名优产品，其中国家2级企业24个，省级先进企业32个，国优产品36种，部优、省优产品达300多种。
