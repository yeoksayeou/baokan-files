The Asian Women's Volleyball Championship Begins
China Women's Volleyball Team Defeats Japan 3:1

	HONG KONG, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Asian Women's Volleyball Championship kicked off today, with China's new lineup defeating Japan 3:1.

	Since the last Olympic Games, there have been no major international women's volleyball tournaments. This championship serves as a warm-up for the upcoming World Cup to be held in Tokyo in November.

	Today's match featured both teams with a mix of veterans and newcomers, showcasing their strengths after a period of renewal. China fielded veterans Su Huijuan, Wu Dan, Li Guojun, and Li Yueling, with key players Lai Yawen (No. 1) and Xu Xin (No. 10) leading the charge. When the situation was favorable, new talents Zhou Hong (No. 4), Mao Wuyang (No. 5), and Sun Lijuan (No. 11) were brought in for training. China took the first set 15:7. In the second set, the Chinese players became complacent, falling behind 2:8. The coach then substituted three newcomers, seemingly to test their ability to handle critical situations. However, the score did not improve, and veterans were brought back in. Japan's new players, 17-year-old Saito Mayumi and the high-jumping 18-year-old Fukuda Kiyoko, made up for Japan's previous weakness in net play. China lost the second set 9:15. Coach Hu Jin described this set as "abnormal." In the following two sets, China's potential was fully realized, with several impressive kills and double-blocks. The 1.87-meter-tall Lai Yawen (No. 1) utilized her height advantage at the net, performing exceptionally well. China won the last two sets with scores of 15:10 and 15:9.

	After the match, Coach Hu Jin said that China's new players had shown their normal level today, but they lacked experience and had not yet produced any outstanding talents. During the match, when Japan's serves caused chaos on the court, China's team made several mistakes, allowing the opponent to score. Hu Jin believes that China's team is stronger at the net, while Japan excels in defense.

    亚洲女排锦标赛揭开战幕
    中国女排3∶1击败日本队
    本报香港10月1日电　记者连锦添报道：第五届亚洲女排锦标赛今天开战，中国女排新阵容以3∶1击败日本队。
    自去年奥运会后，国际上尚无大型女排赛事，今次锦标赛为11月份在东京举行的世界杯赛热身。
    今天的比赛双方都是以老带新，展现换血后的基本力量。中国队由老将苏惠娟、巫丹、李国君及李月明上阵，1号赖亚文、10号许新亦挑大梁，局势占上风时换上新秀4号周红、5号毛武扬、11号孙丽娟上去锻炼，先以15∶7拿下第一局。第二局开始中国姑娘有些松懈，在2∶8落后的不利情况下换上三位新秀，似乎是让新秀磨练危急局势下的承受力，但比分仍无起色，复换老将登场。日本新队员17号斋藤真由美和弹跳惊人的18号福田记代子，弥补了以往网上较弱的劣势。中国队以9∶15失去第二局，教练胡进也称这局打得不正常。在后面的两局中，中国队各种应对的潜力发挥出来，打出若干扣杀、双人拦网的精彩球。身高1米87的1号赖亚文发挥网上优势，表现不俗。中国队赢得后两局比分分别是15∶10和15∶9。
    胡进教练赛后说，中国队新队员今天已表现出正常水平，但经验尚不足，还没有出现惊人的高手。赛中，日本队吊球，场上局面混乱时，我方几次出现漏洞，被对方击中。胡进认为，中国队仍是网上较强，日本队则精于防守。
