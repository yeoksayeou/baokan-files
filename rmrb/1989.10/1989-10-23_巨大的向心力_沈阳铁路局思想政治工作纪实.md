During the turmoil, the roads leading to Shenyang Railway Station were blocked, but by morning, the attendance rate at the station was 100%.

At the Shenyang Railway Bureau, labor discipline is as rigid as the two tracks of a railway, neither narrow nor wide. Employees adhere to these disciplines like trains running on tracks, never deviating. Despite disruptions from blocking trains, lying on the tracks, and causing trouble, they were the first among the 12 railway bureaus in the country to pass the national second-level enterprise and national energy-saving second-level enterprise evaluations. They were also the first to receive the provincial quality management award.

In terms of ideological and political work, what strategies do Shenyang Railway Bureau Party Secretary and Director Li Daqiang and his colleagues employ?

"Make People Trust You"

Li Daqiang, after transferring from the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to the Shenyang Railway Bureau as the director, first visited several grassroots units. He attended two large meetings at the grassroots level, and the impressions were largely similar: leaders on stage lecturing logically and orderly, but few people below were truly listening. Why? Li Daqiang, from his years of experience as a party secretary, understood that to achieve the goal of ideological and political work, one must first gain the trust of the people. Otherwise, no matter how eloquently one speaks, it is all in vain. He told the leaders at all levels: "If we want our ideological and political work to be accepted by the masses, we must gain their trust."

The saying goes, "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked." Li Daqiang and his team started with "self-discipline," refusing bribes, not accepting gifts, and not seeking privileges in matters of children, money, or housing. They then rectified the leadership teams at all levels, curbed negative trends, and promoted positive energy. Most leaders strictly required themselves, walked upright, stood tall, and spoke with conviction, earning the respect of others. For example, the original leadership of Meihekou Station did not strictly demand of themselves, and their words carried little weight, leading to a scattered workforce and sluggish production. After Wang Tingxiu became the station master, he emphasized behavioral education. When it came to housing, it was customary for the head to get the best, but he refused, continuing to live in a small, dilapidated house built during the Japanese occupation, with three generations of nine people crammed into a single bed. When the situation became unbearable, he built a small earthen house in front of the door. At this station, the production bonuses for leaders were lower than those for operational department staff, and the bonuses for office staff were lower than those for operational workers. Workers jokingly referred to their bonus distribution as an "inverted pyramid." A female worker came to Wang Tingxiu's home to request a transfer for her husband. Wang was not home, so she handed a letter to Wang's wife. Wang's wife immediately opened it, revealing a thick wad of cash. She told the woman, "Sister, you've come to the wrong place. Old Wang has two rules for those who give gifts: either you take it back, or we display it at the station." Wang Tingxiu was even stricter with his family, telling them, "What do you mean, trying to use my power to make money? No way!" When someone suggested giving his child a good job, he disagreed: "Do what you can, don't rely on your father's legs to climb up." He even refused to let his son work nearby, insisting that his elder son be transferred to the harsh conditions of Dongtonghua Station, where he later died on duty; his younger son worked in the collective loading team for ten years; and his two daughters relied on their abilities to enter a bearing factory outside the railway. Because he demanded so much of himself, his team improved significantly. Therefore, when they spoke, everyone listened, and the efforts of the upper and lower levels were aligned, making transportation, production, and safety in the Tonghua Railway Division first-rate.

"Focus on Difficulties"

The comrades at the Shenyang Railway Bureau say: gaining the trust of the masses is merely the soil for good work. In this soil, whether the seedlings grow strong depends on each person's methods. Their exploration led to the conclusion: "Ideological and political work should focus on difficulties and be targeted."

The passenger volume of the Shenyang Railway Bureau is 1/4 of the national total, and the freight volume is 1/6 of the national total, creating a sharp contradiction between volume and capacity. Especially for passengers traveling north and south, they often resort to desperate measures to buy tickets: seeking help from acquaintances, buying "negotiated tickets" on the black market, or cursing at the station. The bureau leadership informed all employees of this situation and conducted education on "The People's Railway for the People." Everyone said: what is our patriotism? It is to deliver passengers and goods to their destinations on time. Respecting passengers is loving the people, loving goods is loving the country, and quickly handling matters promotes the development of productivity and the prosperity of the nation. Turning spirit into action, everyone brainstormed and carried out reforms: changing from rest in the train to rest after getting off the train, freeing up sleeper cars for passengers; reforming vehicle composition, changing from 12-car trains to 17-20 cars; based on the needs of the Liaodong Peninsula's opening up, tapping potential and increasing direct trains from Shenyang to Dalian, such as the "Liaodong Peninsula Express." The entire bureau increased the number of sleeper tickets by 230,000 and hard-seat tickets by 170,000, easing the passenger transport pressure.

The stubborn problem of poor service attitudes among railway workers was "cured" by Wang Qingzhi, the station master of Shenyang Station. He consciously organized everyone to experience being passengers and then educated them: poor conditions are not personal; poor attitudes are "man-made disasters" and the responsibility of the individual. After his rectification, the service attitude at the station improved significantly, and letters of praise poured in.

"Light Rain Everywhere"

Heavy rain destroys dikes, light rain nourishes crops—Director Li Daqiang believes this principle also applies to the mind, proposing: "Light rain everywhere, ideological work should be detailed, not hard and fast."

Where there is no ideological and political work, there are problems. Therefore, they proposed "light rain everywhere" in their ideological and political work. The small Dong Station frequently experiences power outages, and workers take this as a command, with on-duty workers being extra cautious and off-duty workers dropping their work to rush to the station to ensure safety. In the northeast, strong winds and heavy snow are common, and workers take this as a command, rushing to the station to clear snow as soon as they see snowflakes. In western Liaoning, thunderstorms are not uncommon, and workers take this as a command, ensuring safety for every train passing through Dong Station, even during thunderstorms and heavy rain. Once, while everyone was engrossed in watching the movie "Southern and Northern Shaolin," the power suddenly went out. The audience "suddenly" all rushed to the station within ten minutes, going to their designated posts to participate in "two fixed double insurance operations." Because everyone was skilled, clear, and precise, all operations were standardized and on point, ensuring the safe passage of every train.

The network of ideological and political work has been established, but the functions of each part are uneven, with some strong and some weak. To enhance the effectiveness of "light rain everywhere," they used modern methods to exchange practices and experiences among various units. Based on production tasks and the mental state of employees, they selected a portion of typical cases and made three videos: "Safety Production Lecture," "Blood Lessons," and "How I Contribute to Safety Production." After the videos were made, they were played at each station, and everyone watched them, causing a significant impact throughout the bureau. Previously, the Changchun Railway Division frequently had accidents and was always at the bottom in terms of safety production. After watching the videos, the division organized employees to discuss seriously, identify gaps, and for more than three years, there have been no major accidents, making it an advanced unit in safety production. In the first half of this year, the entire bureau completed transportation tasks four days ahead of schedule, achieving 200 days of safe operation without major accidents for the first time, creating the highest comprehensive economic benefits in the same period in history.

　　巨大的向心力
　　——沈阳铁路局思想政治工作纪实
　　本报记者　段心强
    动乱中，通往沈阳火车站的大小路口被堵，可到早上上班时，车站铁路职工点名，出勤率：100％。
    在沈阳铁路局，劳动纪律就像两条铁轨一样摆在那里，不窄也不宽；职工执行纪律，就像运行的火车那样，一点也不偏离轨道。正因为这样，尽管有拦车的、卧轨的、闹事的干扰，他们还是在全国12个铁路局中第一个通过了国家二级企业和国家节能二级企业评审，第一个获得省级质量管理奖。
    在思想政治工作方面，沈阳铁路局党委书记、局长李大强和他的同事们有何妙招呢？
    “让人信任你”
    李大强从郑州铁路局到沈阳铁路局当局长，先到下边跑了一圈。他参加了两个基层单位的大会，印象大同小异：领导在台上讲道理，井井有条，可下边真正听讲的没有几个。为什么？李大强从自己多年当党委书记的实践中明白：搞思想政治工作要达到目的，首先得让人信任你，否则，你讲得天花乱坠，也等于零。他告诉各级领导：“我们要想让自己的思想政治工作被群众接受，就要让人信任你。”
    上梁不正下梁歪。李大强和他的“一班人”先从“自我”抓起，不吃请，不受礼，在孩子、票子、房子上不搞特权。接着，他们整顿各级领导班子，刹歪风，扬正气。大多数领导干部严格要求自己，走得正，站得直，说话硬气，大家信服。比如梅河口车站原领导自我要求不严，说话没人听，致使职工人心涣散，生产不景气。王廷秀当站长后，重视行为教育。分房子，按说一把手要最好的已成惯例，可他不要，一直住在日伪时期盖的小筒子房里，一张炕上打着木板格住着老少三代9口人，实在住不下了，就在门前盖了一间土屋。在这个站，领导的生产奖低于运转车间干部，科室干部的奖金低于运转职工。工人形象地说，他们的奖金分配是“倒金字塔”。一个女工为丈夫调转的事到王廷秀家，老王不在，她递给王夫人一封信，王的爱人当即拆开，原来是厚厚一叠人民币，她对那位女工说：“大妹子，你拜佛认错了门。老王对送礼者两个法：要不你带回去，要不拿到车站去展览。”王廷秀对老婆孩子要求更严，有的要做买卖，他冷冷地说：“咋的，想借我的权捞钱，没门！”有人提出要给他小孩调换一个好工作他不同意：“有多大才干多大事，不准抱着老子的粗腿往上爬。”他甚至连儿子在身边工作都不同意，大儿子硬是从他所在的站调往条件差的东通化车站，后来，不幸以身殉职；小儿子在集体装卸队一干就是10年；两个女儿靠本事考进路外的轴承厂。由于他对自己要求严，一班人就好多了。因此，他们说话，大家都听，上下一个劲，运输生产和安全在通化铁路分局是数一数二的。
    “围绕难点做”
    沈阳铁路局的同志说：思想政治工作者得到群众信任仅仅是做好工作的土壤，在这土壤里，能否生长出茁壮的苗还得看各人的手段。他们摸索的结果是：“思想政治工作要围绕难点做，有个针对性。”
    沈阳铁路局的客运量是全国铁路的1／4，货运量是全国铁路的1／6，运量运力之间的矛盾十分尖锐。特别是南来北往的客人常因买不到票急得乱求“医”：或托人走后门，或在黑市买“议价票”，或在车站骂大街。局领导把这种情况告诉给全体职工，结合进行“人民铁路为人民”的教育。大家说：咱们的爱国主义是什么？就是把旅客和货物及时送到目的地，尊客就是爱人民，爱货就是爱国家，尽快办好事，推动生产力发展，促进国家的兴旺。精神变行动，大家齐动脑筋，进行乘务改革：由乘务员在车上休息，改为到班下车休息，腾出宿营车给旅客；改革车辆编组，变12节车厢为17节到20节；根据辽东半岛对外开放的需要，挖潜力，增加从沈阳到大连间直达的“辽东半岛号”……。全局一年增加卧铺票23万张，硬座票17万张，缓解了客运上的矛盾。
    铁路工作人员服务态度不好这个顽症却被沈阳站站长王卿智“治”好了。他有意识地组织大家当乘客，然后教育大家：条件差，与个人无关；态度差，则属于“人祸”，由个人负责。经他一整治，车站服务态度大大改观，表扬信不断飞来。
    “普降毛毛雨”
    大雨毁堤坝，小雨发庄稼——李大强局长认为，这个理也适用于心田，便提出：“普降毛毛雨，思想工作要细，不硬碰硬。”
    大路不走长草多，哪里没有思想政治工作，哪里毛病多。因此他们在思想政治工作中提出“普降毛毛雨”。小东站经常停电，职工们以停电为令，当班的慎而又慎，按章作业；休班的放下手里的活，跑步上站保安全；东北风大雪多，职工们以雪为令，一见雪花人人上站去除雪；辽西雷雨也不少，职工们以雷雨为令，哪怕是电闪雷鸣，风雨交加，只要列车从小东站通过，趟趟保安全。一次，大家看电影《南北少林》看得正起劲，忽然停电。观众“忽拉”一下全部不约而同地在十分钟之内跑到车站，按规定上岗参加“两固定双保险作业”。由于大家技术精，一口清，一手准，全部标准化作业一点不离格，保证一辆辆列车安全通过。
    思想政治工作的网虽然已经结成，但各个部分的功能有强有弱，很不平衡。为了提高“普降毛毛雨”的效果，他们采用现代化的手段，交流各单位的作法和经验。针对生产任务和职工思想状态，他们选择一部分典型拍了三部录像：《安全生产讲座》、《血的教训》、《我怎样为安全生产作贡献》。录像制好后，一个站一个站地播放，每一个人都看，在全局震动很大。过去长春铁路分局经常出事故，安全生产方面总排在后面。看过录像后，分局发动职工认真讨论，找出差距，三年多来，没出现责任事故，成为安全生产的先进单位。今年上半年，全局提前4天完成运输任务，第一次实现无重大事故行车200天，创历史同期最高的综合经济效益。
