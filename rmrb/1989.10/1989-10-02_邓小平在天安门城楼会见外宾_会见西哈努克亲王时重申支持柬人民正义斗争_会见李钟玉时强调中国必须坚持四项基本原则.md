	Chairman Deng Xiaoping this evening met with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, and his wife on Tiananmen Gate. Deng said, "We support your realization of true independence and self-reliance, a genuine independence, not a false one."

	Prince Sihanouk, on behalf of the Democratic Kampuchea, extended warm festive greetings to the Chinese people and expressed gratitude for the great support the Chinese people have given to the Cambodian people.

	Deng said, "The Chinese and Cambodian peoples have supported each other for decades. You will not forget us, and we will not forget you."

	When discussing the establishment of a Cambodian coalition government, Deng said that this coalition government should not be composed of three or two parties, but should include four parties.

	Sihanouk agreed with Deng's view. He pointed out that in the coalition government, the four parties must have equal status.

	Deng told Sihanouk, "Vietnam has proposed to normalize relations with China. We welcome this, but there is a condition: Vietnam must truly, completely, and cleanly withdraw its troops from Cambodia."

	Premier Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin were present at the meeting.

	Chairman Deng Xiaoping this evening met with Korean guests on Tiananmen Gate and stressed the need to adhere to the four basic principles.

	In meeting with Li Chong-yul, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Vice Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Deng said: "In the past period, bourgeois liberalization was carried out, and the ideological battlefield was lost. Now we must definitely adhere to the four basic principles."

	Deng said, "The recent events in Beijing were a bad thing, but in the end, they are beneficial to us because they have made us more sober."

	Deng thanked Chairman Kim Il-sung for sending Li Chong-yul to lead the Korean party and government delegation to Beijing to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He told Li, "Please convey to Chairman Kim Il-sung that the social order in China has already returned to normal, please rest assured." Deng thanked Chairman Kim Il-sung and the Korean party and government for their support to China. He requested Li to convey his cordial greetings to Chairman Kim Il-sung.

	Li conveyed Chairman Kim Il-sung's cordial greetings to Deng. He told Deng, "I will definitely convey your greetings to Chairman Kim Il-sung when I return to my country and inform him that you are in good health. I will also report to Chairman Kim Il-sung the situation I have seen in Beijing. I believe that Chairman Kim will be very pleased to hear this."

	Premier Li Peng was present at the meeting.

	Chairman Deng Xiaoping this evening met with foreign guests invited to the national day gala on Tiananmen Gate, shook hands with them one by one, and posed for a group photo.
