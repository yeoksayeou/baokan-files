Former Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka announced today through his son-in-law Naoki Tanaka that he will end his more than 40-year political career and will not participate in the next House of Representatives election.

The term of office for members of the Japanese House of Representatives is four years, and this term will end next summer. However, considering the interests of the Liberal Democratic Party, Prime Minister Sosuke Uno may dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general election by the end of this year or early next year.

Tanaka became the president of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Prime Minister of Japan in the summer of 1972. That same autumn, he decisively decided to visit Beijing, where he signed the Japan-China Joint Statement with Chinese leaders, restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries and ending the long-standing abnormal state of affairs between Japan and China. In late November 1974, Tanaka resigned due to public criticism over the unclear origins of his political funds. In the summer of 1976, he was arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of involvement in the Lockheed bribery case, but was later released on bail. At the time of his arrest, he announced his withdrawal from the Liberal Democratic Party. In the spring of 1985, he suffered a cerebral thrombosis and has not yet recovered.

Tanaka was once the leader of the largest faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, the Tanaka faction. In early July 1987, most members of the Tanaka faction followed Noboru Takeshita to form the Takeshita faction. Since then, Tanaka's influence on the Japanese political scene has significantly diminished.

    日前首相田中角荣将从政坛引退
    新华社东京10月14日电　日本前首相田中角荣今天通过其女婿田中直纪发表声明，他将结束40多年的政治生涯，不再参加下届众议院的选举。
    日本众议院议员任期为4年，到明年夏天本届任期届满。但自民党总裁海部出自本党利害关系，可能于今年底明年初解散众院实行大选。
    田中是于1972年夏天当选自民党总裁和日本首相的。同年秋天，他果断地决定去北京访问，同中国领导人签署日中联合声明，恢复了两国外交关系，从而结束了日中两国多年来的不正常状态。1974年11月底，田中因政治资金来路不清等问题受到社会批评，遂引咎辞职。1976年夏天又因被指控涉嫌洛克希德贿赂案而被捕入狱，后被保释。入狱同时他声明退出自民党。1985年春天患脑血栓，至今未能痊愈。
    田中曾是自民党内最大派系田中派的领导人。1987年7月初，田中派大部分成员跟随竹下登成立了竹下派。自此，田中对日本政坛的影响力大大减弱。
