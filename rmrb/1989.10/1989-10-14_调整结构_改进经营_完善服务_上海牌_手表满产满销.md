In a market that is relatively sluggish, how can enterprises overcome the difficulties in sales? The experience of the Shanghai Watch Factory is: adjust the structure, improve management, and perfect service. Relying on these three strategies, the "Shanghai Brand" watches have achieved full production and sales in the fiercely competitive national watch industry. From January to August this year, the 4.358 million watches produced were all sold, and there were no overdue payments. This experience has been widely noted by the business community in Shanghai.

How to get out of an unfavorable situation? The Shanghai Watch Factory believes that it is necessary to boost morale and rely on all employees to make efforts in adjusting the product structure. They found that mechanical watches are now in high demand and immediately changed the plan. This year, the original plan was to increase the production of electronic watches by 2.4 million units, but now it has been reduced to 1.3 million units, concentrating efforts on significantly increasing the production of mechanical watches to meet the needs of rural consumers. At the same time, they rationally match the proportions of men's watches, women's watches, calendar watches, and thin watches to adapt to the ever-changing market conditions. The factory has also successively developed transparent hollow men's and women's watches, dual-calendar quartz electronic watches, and 2.7mm type electronic watches to meet the needs of urban young consumers.

While adjusting the structure, the factory's management methods are flexible and varied, carefully handling the relationships between new and old customers, large and small batches, within and outside the industry, and exports and domestic sales, opening up new sales channels.

Continuously improving after-sales service is also an important condition for "Shanghai Brand" watches to gain the trust of consumers. Consumers lack confidence in the quality of electronic watches. For this reason, the Shanghai Watch Factory actively provides free training for maintenance personnel for commercial departments, holding more than 10 free training sessions. More than 100 business units in various places have improved the maintenance skills of more than 300 key personnel.

    调整结构　改进经营　完善服务
    “上海牌”手表满产满销
    本报上海10月13日电　记者章世鸿报道：在市场较为疲软的情况下，企业面临的销售困难怎样解决？上海手表厂的经验是：调整结构、改进经营、完善服务。依靠这三条，“上海牌”手表在全国手表行业激烈竞争中实现满产满销。今年1至8月份生产的435.8万只手表全部销完，而且没有拖欠货款。这个经验受到上海企业界普遍重视。
    怎样从不利的形势中摆脱出来？上海手表厂认为应该振奋精神，依靠全体职工在调整产品结构上努力。他们发现，如今热销的是机械表，立即改变计划。今年原定电子表增产240万只，现在压缩到130万只，集中力量大幅度增产机械表，满足农村消费者的需要。同时，合理搭配男表、女表、日历表、薄型表的比例，适应不断变化的市场新形势。该厂又先后试制成全透明镂空男女表、双历石英电子表和2.7毫米型电子表，迎合城市青年消费者的需要。
    在调整结构的同时，该厂的经营方式灵活多变、认真处理好新客户和老客户、大批量和小批量、行业内部和行业外部、出口与内销等各方面关系，开拓销售新渠道。
    不断完善售后服务，也是“上海牌”手表取信于消费者的重要条件。消费者对电子表的质量信心不足。为此，上海手表厂主动为商业部门义务培训维修人员，免费举办10多期培训班。各地100多个商业单位的300多名骨干提高了维修技术。
