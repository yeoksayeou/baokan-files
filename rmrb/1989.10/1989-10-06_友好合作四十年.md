Today marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and North Korea. For the peoples of both countries, this is a day that deserves to be remembered forever. Over the past 40 years, the traditional friendship between the two peoples has been continuously strengthened and developed under new historical conditions, and exchanges and cooperation in politics, economy, culture, and other fields have been fruitful.

The friendship between China and North Korea was forged and nurtured by Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Chairman Kim Il-sung. After the establishment of diplomatic relations, Chairman Kim Il-sung visited China several times, forming a deep friendship with Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other party and state leaders. Premier Zhou Enlai also visited North Korea twice, further strengthening the friendship between China and North Korea. The practice of frequent mutual visits by leaders of the two countries gradually became a tradition, and in recent years, this tradition has been further carried forward. This close interaction has continuously strengthened and developed the deep brotherly affection between the peoples of the two countries in their long-term joint struggle.

In terms of economic construction, the peoples of the two countries have learned from each other, helped each other, complemented each other's strengths and weaknesses, and exchanged what they have, achieving one success after another. Some provinces and cities in China have formed friendly provinces (cities) with some provinces and cities in North Korea, providing mutual support. To fully utilize the rich water resources of the Yalu River, since the early 1950s, the two countries have jointly invested in the expansion and construction of hydropower stations, which not only provided strong impetus for the construction of the two countries but also set a new example for the joint development of the border river.

The exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in education, science, culture, and sports have become increasingly extensive and fruitful. The system of sending students and trainees to each other, which began in the 1950s, has been long-standing, with increasing numbers and expanding fields of study. Experts and scholars from the two countries often gather together to discuss academic matters and exchange the latest research results. Many excellent literary works from ancient and modern North Korea have been translated into Chinese and published in large quantities, receiving widespread welcome from Chinese readers. Many literary classics from China have also been introduced to the North Korean people. North Korean films have always had a large audience in China, and many Chinese films have left a deep impression on North Korean audiences. The two countries send art troupes to visit and perform every year, and athletes from both sides often participate in various competitions together. News and publishing workers from the two countries often visit each other, widely introducing the achievements and experiences of the peoples of the two countries in various fields.

Both China and North Korea face the issue of national reunification. The two countries have always supported each other in this regard. In international affairs, the two governments cooperate with each other and support each other.

Looking back at the 40-year history of exchanges between China and North Korea, we deeply feel that the fraternal friendship forged in blood between the peoples of the two countries can withstand any test of history. Not long ago, Chairman Kim Il-sung, the Workers' Party of Korea, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the North Korean people expressed firm support for our suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, which is a vivid manifestation of this friendship. We believe that in the coming years, this friendship will be further strengthened and developed. May the friendship between China and North Korea be passed down from generation to generation, shining with the moon and stars, and coexisting with the heavens and the earth.

    友好合作四十年
    周必忠
    今天是中国与朝鲜建交40周年纪念日。对于中朝人民来说，这是一个值得永远纪念的日子。40年来，两国人民之间的传统友谊，在新的历史条件下不断巩固发展，两国在政治、经济、文化等各个领域的交流与合作卓有成效。
    中朝友谊是由毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和金日成主席缔造和培育起来的。建交后，金日成主席曾多次访问我国，同毛泽东主席、周恩来总理等党和国家领导人，结下了十分亲密的友情。周恩来总理也曾两次访问朝鲜，进一步加强了中朝友谊。中朝两国领导人频繁互访的做法逐渐形成为一种传统，近年来，这一传统得到进一步发扬。这种亲密交往，使两国人民在长期共同斗争中结成的兄弟般的深情厚谊，不断巩固和发展。
    在经济建设方面，两国人民互相学习，彼此帮助，取长补短，互通有无，取得了一个又一个成果。我国的一些省市同朝鲜的一些道市结成友好省（道）市，互相支援。为了充分利用鸭绿江丰富的水利资源，从50年代初开始，两国合资扩建和新建的一座座水电站，不仅为两国的建设增添了强大的动力，也为合作开发界河提供了新的范例。
    中朝两国在教育、科学、文化、体育等方面的交流与合作，日益广泛，而且成效卓著。从50年代开始的互派留学生、进修生制度，长期坚持下来，人数越来越多，所学专业不断扩大。两国的专家、学者经常聚集一堂，切磋学问，交流最新研究成果。朝鲜古代和现代的许多优秀文学名著被译成中文大量出版，受到中国读者的普遍欢迎，我国的许多文学名著也被介绍给朝鲜人民。朝鲜电影在我国一直拥有广大的观众，我国的不少电影也给朝鲜观众留下了深刻的印象。两国每年都要派艺术团互相访问演出，双方体育运动员经常在一起参加各种比赛。两国的新闻出版工作者经常进行互访，广泛介绍两国人民在各方面取得的成就和经验。
    中朝都面临着国家统一的问题。两国在这方面从来都是相互支持的。在国际事务中，两国政府互相配合，彼此声援。
    回顾40年来中朝两国交往的历史，我们深深感到，两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，是经得起任何历史风浪的考验的。不久前，金日成主席、朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和朝鲜人民，对我们平息北京反革命暴乱所表示的坚定支持，正是这种友谊的一个生动体现。我们相信，在未来的岁月中，这种友谊必将得到进一步巩固和发展。愿中朝友谊世代相传，与日月同辉，同天地共存。
