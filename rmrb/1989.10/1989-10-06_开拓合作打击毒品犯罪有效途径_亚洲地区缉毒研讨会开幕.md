The "Asian Regional Drug Control Seminar," co-hosted by the Chinese police and the Chinese National Center of Interpol, opened today in Beijing. Attendees include high-ranking police officers and drug control experts from 32 countries and regions, including representatives from 25 Asian countries and regions, as well as representatives from Africa, Latin America, Europe, Oceania, and the Americas.

Police reports indicate that the drug problem in the Asian region is becoming increasingly severe, with transnational drug trafficking and cross-border crimes on the rise. This issue, which threatens human health and social stability, has garnered widespread international attention. Due to China's proximity to drug-producing regions, there have been multiple instances of drug trafficking through Chinese territory in recent years. This situation has drawn the attention of relevant Chinese authorities.

In his opening remarks, Vice Premier and Minister of Public Security Wang Fang urged the attending police officers and experts to contribute their expertise and wisdom for the common good of the Asian and global communities. He emphasized the need to explore effective regional cooperation and to make new contributions to the eradication of this international scourge. Wang Fang mentioned that in modern history, China has been severely affected by drug problems. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government has consistently adhered to a strict anti-drug policy.

He pointed out that in recent years, as drug problems have resurfaced in China, the government is taking decisive measures to address the issue. Efforts are being made to strengthen law enforcement in drug control and to actively promote effective international cooperation in this area.

    开拓合作打击毒品犯罪有效途径
    亚洲地区缉毒研讨会开幕
    本报北京10月5日讯　记者张志业报道：由中国警方和国际刑警组织中国国家中心局作为东道主的“亚洲地区缉毒研讨会”，今日在此间开幕。出席会议的32个国家和地区的高级警官和缉毒专家中，不仅有25个亚洲国家和地区的代表，还有非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲、大洋洲和美洲的代表。
    警方提供的情况表明，亚洲地区毒品问题日趋严重，过境贩毒、跨国犯罪突出。这个危及人类健康和社会安宁的大问题，已经引起国际社会广泛的高度重视。由于中国毗邻毒品生产地，近年来已多次破获通过我国境贩运毒品的案件。此种情况已引起中国有关当局关注。
    国务委员、公安部长王芳在今天的开幕式上呼吁与会的各国警官、专家为了亚洲及全世界人民的共同利益，奉献出经验和智慧，为开拓地区合作的有效途径、为铲除毒品这一国际公害做出新贡献。他在致词中介绍说，中国在近代历史上是一个深受毒品之害的国家。新中国成立之后，中国政府始终不渝地坚持严格禁毒的方针政策。
    他指出，近几年来，随着毒品问题在我国的重新出现，中国政府正在采取坚决治理措施，强化缉毒执法工作，并积极鼓励在缉毒问题上进行有效的国际合作。
