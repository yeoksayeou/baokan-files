The wish to bring Mother out to enjoy a few years of peace has long been buried in my heart. That year, during my first visit home, Mother was barely over fifty, but she looked as old as someone in their sixties. Her once-black hair had turned gray almost overnight, and her formerly agile hands and feet had become sluggish. Seeing Mother's worn face, my heart ached. Father had passed away early, and Mother had worked tirelessly to raise us four siblings, which had taken a toll on her health. At that moment, I vowed to myself that I would achieve something significant and bring Mother out to enjoy a few years of comfort!

Time flew by, and I was promoted to a leadership position, eventually meeting the criteria to bring family members to live with me. I returned home specifically to bring Mother out. However, Mother was unwilling to leave: "I've lived here all my life; I can't bear to leave home or the fields!" Mother refused to go, and my wife, unwilling to leave the beautiful city, also did not want to move. In the end, the plan did not materialize.

In recent years, my wife often hinted at the idea of me transferring out of the military. I thought it was a good idea; if I transferred, we could have a stable home, and I could fulfill my wish of bringing Mother to the city. However, during the Tiger Year's Spring Festival, while I was on leave visiting home, Mother suddenly suggested that she wanted to come to the military base to enjoy a few years of comfort, and she also wanted my wife to accompany her. My heart pounded. Seeing that my transfer was likely within two years, why bother to bring my wife and children to the military base? I said, "Mom, it will be at most two years, and I will bring you to the city." Mother did not look up: "I am already 64 years old, and I have many illnesses. Who knows if I can wait for two more years? If you have difficulties, Mother will not insist." Mother's words made my heart heavy. My wife, seeing my dilemma, said, "Your transfer is still uncertain. Why not go for two years? As long as Mom is happy..." Mother smiled and said, "It's the daughter-in-law who has a kind heart, knowing how to care for her mother-in-law."

Last year, during the season of blooming lotuses, Mother and my wife and child moved to the military base's family quarters. Mother spent each day cooking, playing with the grandchildren, and in the evenings, the family would gather to watch TV and chat, bringing me joy and forgetting many troubles and unpleasantness. Sometimes, I was very busy, but I was happy and felt that everything had meaning. My wife also stopped mentioning the transfer. However, Mother began to miss home, worrying about my brother's children and the chickens and pigs at home. She finally proposed to return to her old home. At first, she mentioned it a few times a day, but later, she talked about it every day. We could not persuade her; Mother could not leave the farmhouse, for that was the root of her life. I thought that perhaps her urgent desire to come to the military base was driven by a momentary novelty. Finally, Mother stayed in the military base for only about five months before she insisted on returning home.

After Mother returned home, she quickly sent a letter through someone: "Mother wanted the daughter-in-law to accompany me to the military base because I heard that you are trying to transfer out of the military early. Mother saw from your years of commendation letters that the military needs you, and you should settle down in the camp. Mother thought that only by having the daughter-in-law and grandson accompany you to the military base could you settle down and work hard. So Mother came up with this plan. Originally, Mother planned to stay with you for a while longer before returning, but seeing that you and your wife are living a happy life, and knowing that your older brother's family is still quite difficult, Mother thought that she could still help them. Mother is now doing all this for her children, hoping that you and your daughter-in-law can understand Mother's intentions." After reading Mother's letter, my eyes welled up with tears. As a son, I had not understood my own mother; an illiterate mother, a mother who had toiled in the mountains for half her life... Mother's love is as vast and warm as spring sunshine, and I have no way to repay it. I can only assure Mother: I will not disappoint you!

    接母亲
    韩强毛
    把母亲接出来享几年清福，是埋在我心底已久的愿望。那年，我第一次探家，母亲才50出头，却苍老得像年过花甲的人，满头黑发似乎转瞬间变得灰白，原先干净利落的手脚，也变得迟钝了。望着母亲憔悴的面容，我心中一阵发酸。父亲早逝，母亲为把我们兄弟姊妹四人拉扯大，过份操劳才累成这个样子的呀！那时我暗下决心，一定要干出点名堂来，把母亲接出来享几年福！
    斗转星移，我提了干，继而又具备了随军条件，便专程回家去接母亲。哪知母亲怎么也不愿离开家：“住了一辈子了，我舍不得家，舍不得家里的地！”母亲不愿走，妻也因舍不得离开那美丽的小城，而终于未能成行。
    这几年，妻常流露出要我转业的意思，我想也好，转业了，有了安定的家，把母亲接到城里也可了却我的心愿。不料虎年春节，我休假探亲，母亲却突然提出要跟我到部队去享几年福，还要妻也随队同去。我心里却敲起小鼓。眼看这两年转业有望，何必再把妻儿老小拖到部队去？我便说：“妈，顶多两年，我接您到城里去。”母亲头也不抬：“我都64岁了，病又多，晓得等到等不到两年，你要有难处，娘就不勉强了。”母亲的话说得我心里像打翻了五味瓶。妻知道我作难，说：“你转业的事，还没个影，要不先去两年，只要妈高兴……”母亲乐了，说：“还是媳妇心眼细，知道疼娘。”
    去年荷花盛开的季节，母亲和妻小迁到了部队的家属院。母亲每天烧烧饭，逗逗小孙孙，晚上一家人围在一起看看电视，聊聊天，家庭的天伦之乐使我忘却了许多烦恼和不快。有时，我也很忙，但忙得很快活，仿佛一切都变得很有意义了，妻也不念叨转业的事了。可母亲却又挂念起家里来了，挂念我哥哥的小孩，挂念家里的鸡笼猪圈。她终于向我们提出要回老家去了。开始是几天说一次，后来竟发展到天天念叨，我们劝说不住她，母亲离不开农舍，只有那儿才是她生命的根。我想，她迫切地要到部队来，也许是一时的新鲜感所驱使吧。终于，母亲只在部队住了5个来月，硬是归家了。
    母亲回到家里，很快托人捎来了信：“娘让媳妇陪同去部队，是因为听说儿在争取早点转业。娘从儿这些年得来的立功喜报中觉得，部队需要你，你应该安心在军营。娘想，只有让媳妇和小孙孙随军到部队，才能使儿安下心来干。所以娘就弄了这个计谋。本来，娘打算跟你们多住些日子再回来，但看到你们的小日子过得红红火火，小两口顶恩爱的，娘又想起你们的哥嫂家里还比较困难，娘现在的身板还硬朗，能帮他们一把。娘现在所做的一切都是为了儿女，希望儿和媳妇能理解娘的心思。”看完母亲的信，我的眼睛湿润了，当儿子的竟未能理解自己的母亲；一个大字不识的母亲，一个在山沟沟里劳苦了大半辈子的母亲……母亲春天阳光般厚博的爱，我是无以报答的，只有一点请妈妈放心：儿不会给您丢脸！
