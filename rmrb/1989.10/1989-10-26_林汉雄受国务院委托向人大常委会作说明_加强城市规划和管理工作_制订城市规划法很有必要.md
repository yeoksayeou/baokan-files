The Premier of the State Council, Li Peng, submitted to the seventh session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, held today, a proposal from the State Council for the examination of the "Draft of the Urban Planning Law of the People's Republic of China."

The proposal states that urban planning is to determine the nature, scale, and development direction of a city, to rationally utilize urban land, to coordinate the spatial layout and various construction projects of the city, and is an important part of the state's management of urban construction. It is a necessary condition for achieving the goals of urban economic and social development. Urban planning involves a wide range of urban political, economic, cultural construction, and urban development, and has strong comprehensiveness. It is necessary to ensure the correct implementation of urban planning through legislation. The draft of the Urban Planning Law has been discussed and approved by the Standing Committee of the State Council and is now submitted for examination.

At today's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Lin Hanxiong, Minister of the Ministry of Construction, was entrusted by the State Council to explain the "Draft of the Urban Planning Law."

Regarding the necessity of legislation, Lin Hanxiong said that since the founding of the People's Republic, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, urban planning work in China has developed rapidly. In 1984, the State Council issued the "Regulations on Urban Planning." The implementation of these regulations has provided legal guarantees for urban planning and management work in China. It has played an active role in promoting the scientific and rational planning of cities in China and ensuring the correct and smooth implementation of urban planning. However, in recent years, with the deepening of urban reform and development, the "Regulations on Urban Planning" can no longer meet the requirements of urban planning work. The status and role of cities in national economic and social development are increasingly strengthened, and the structure and functions of cities are becoming more diversified, posing many new challenges to urban planning and management work; in the practice of urban planning and construction reform, experiences have been accumulated to solve these new problems, and it is necessary to improve the urban planning legal system according to the requirements of reform and development and practical experience; the promulgation or revision of laws such as the "Land Management Law" and the "Environmental Protection Law" also requires corresponding modifications and supplements to some of the contents stipulated in the "Regulations on Urban Planning"; urban planning involves a wide range of urban political, economic, cultural construction, and urban development, and has strong comprehensiveness, and it is also necessary to improve the authority of urban planning through legislation. At the fourth session of the Sixth National People's Congress in 1986, some deputies proposed to formulate the Urban Planning Law of China as soon as possible, reflecting the objective need. Therefore, it is very urgent and necessary to formulate the "Urban Planning Law."

Regarding the urban development policy, Lin Hanxiong said that China is a country with a population of 1.1 billion. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the reform of the urban and rural system and the development of the economy and society have greatly accelerated the process of urbanization in China. In 1988, the urban population of the whole country had reached 208.1 million, and there were 58 large cities with a population of more than 500,000 (including 28 cities with a population of more than 1 million), 110 medium-sized cities with a population of more than 200,000 but less than 500,000, 266 small cities with a population of less than 200,000, and 11,481 towns. During the drafting of this law, extensive research has been conducted on the control of the scale of large cities and the reasonable development of medium-sized and small cities. Based on the opinions of relevant departments and experts and scholars, we believe that the scale of large cities, especially the population and land use scale of urban areas, should be controlled. This is conducive to achieving good economic and social benefits for cities in national social and economic life, and promoting the formation and development of the urban system.

He said, "Controlling the scale of large cities, reasonably developing medium-sized cities, and actively developing small cities" is the urban development policy established by the State Council in 1980. Over the past decade, this policy has played an active role in guiding the reasonable development of cities of different scales in China, promoting the rational distribution of productive forces and population, and forming a relatively reasonable urban system. Now, small cities, including towns, have emerged nationwide. To guide the planned and reasonable development of small cities, the "Draft of the Urban Planning Law" adjusts China's urban development policy to: "Control the scale of large cities, reasonably develop medium-sized and small cities" (Article 4). This will be conducive to making China's urbanization process adapt to the level of development of productive forces. China is still in the primary stage of socialism. To prevent the occurrence of high-standard and high-indicator phenomena in urban planning that are detached from national conditions, it is necessary to carry out the spirit of "hard work and frugal construction." The "Draft of the Urban Planning Law" stipulates that "urban planning must conform to China's national conditions, adapt to the level of development of productive forces, and carry out the policy of frugal construction" as an important principle of China's urban planning (Article 5).

Regarding the urban planning area, Lin Hanxiong said that the urban planning area is not just the concept of the urban area but must also include the suburban areas closely related to the long-term development of the city, as well as important infrastructure control areas such as water sources, airports, transportation hubs, power, and communication corridors far from the urban area, and scenic and tourist areas as part of the city. Otherwise, it will cause chaos and lack of control in the construction of the urban periphery, especially the urban-rural junction, which will seriously affect the reasonable layout and normal development of the city. Therefore, the "Draft of the Urban Planning Law" defines the urban planning area as "the urban area, suburban area, and the area that needs unified control for urban construction and development." At the same time, considering the specific situation of each place, it is also stipulated that the people's government of the city shall, when formulating the overall plan, determine the scope of the urban planning area in the overall planning scheme of the city according to the above principles. This regulation is conducive to the unified planning and management of the urban jurisdiction and the overall and smooth implementation of the urban plan, and also creates conditions for the long-term development of the city.

Regarding the implementation of urban planning, Lin Hanxiong said that the planning management of various construction projects in cities is the basic means of implementing urban planning. The site selection and location of construction projects within the urban planning area are the preliminary work for basic construction and the expropriation and allocation of land. Only by strictly managing the site selection and location of construction projects by the urban planning administrative department in accordance with the urban planning can the disorderly use of urban land and construction layout be effectively prevented, so as to achieve urban planning and ensure the rational and economical use of land. Therefore, based on the summary of China's urban planning management experience and in coordination with the "Land Management Law," the "Draft of the Urban Planning Law" has made provisions for the site selection and location of construction projects within the urban planning area. First, it is stipulated that in the feasibility study stage of the construction project, the site selection and layout of the construction project related to urban planning must comply with the urban planning, and the project proposal and design task book for approval must be attached with the site selection opinion letter from the urban planning administrative department; second, it is stipulated that the use of land for construction within the urban planning area must first determine the location and scope of the construction land by the urban planning administrative department and issue a construction land planning permit, and then proceed with the procedures for the expropriation and allocation of land in accordance with the provisions of the "Land Management Law."

    林汉雄受国务院委托向人大常委会作说明
　　加强城市规划和管理工作
　　制订城市规划法很有必要
    新华社北京10月25日电　国务院总理李鹏向今天举行的七届全国人大常委会十次会议提交了国务院关于提请审议《中华人民共和国城市规划法（草案）》的议案。
    议案说，城市规划是为了确定城市性质、规模和发展方向，合理利用城市土地、协调城市空间布局和各项建设所作的综合部署，是国家管理城市建设的重要内容，是实现城市经济和社会发展目标的必要条件。城市规划涉及城市政治、经济、文化建设和城市发展的广泛领域，具有很强的综合性，需要通过立法来保证城市规划的正确实施。城市规划法草案业经国务院常务会议讨论通过，现提请审议。
    在今天的人大常委会上，建设部部长林汉雄受国务院的委托，就《城市规划法（草案）》作了说明。
    关于立法的必要性，林汉雄说，建国以来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，我国城市规划工作有了较快的发展。1984年国务院发布了《城市规划条例》。这个条例的施行，为我国城市规划和管理工作提供了法律保障。它对促进我国城市规划的科学合理，保障城市规划的正确、顺利实施起到了积极作用。但是，近几年来，随着城市改革的深入发展，《城市规划条例》已不能适应城市规划工作的要求。城市在国民经济和社会发展中的地位和作用日益加强，城市的结构和功能日趋多样化，对城市规划和管理工作提出了许多新课题；在城市规划、建设的改革实践中，也积累了解决这些新课题的经验，需要根据改革发展的要求和实践的经验，完善城市规划法制；《土地管理法》、《环境保护法》等法律的相继颁布或修订，也需要对《城市规划条例》规定的一些内容进行相应的修改和补充；城市规划涉及城市政治、经济、文化建设和城市发展的广泛领域，具有很强的综合性，也需要通过立法来提高城市规划的权威性。1986年第六届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上，一些代表提议尽快制定我国城市规划法，反映了客观实际的需要。因此，制定《城市规划法》是非常迫切和十分必要的。
    关于城市发展方针，林汉雄说，我国是拥有11亿人口的大国。党的十一届三中全会以来，城乡体制改革和经济、社会的发展，大大加快了我国城市化的进程。1988年全国城市人口已达2.081亿，50万人口以上的大城市已达58个
  （其中百万人口以上的城市已达28个），20万以上、不满50万人口的中等城市110个，20万人口以下的小城市266个，建制镇11481个。在本法起草过程中，对大城市规模的控制、中等城市和小城市如何合理发展问题进行了广泛研究。综合各有关部门和专家、学者的意见，我们认为大城市规模，特别是市区人口和用地规模应当控制。这有利于城市在国家社会、经济生活中取得良好的经济效益、社会效益，并促进城镇体系的形成和发展。
    他说，“控制大城市规模、合理发展中等城市、积极发展小城市”，是1980年经国务院批准而确立的我国城市发展方针。近10年来，这一方针对指导我国不同规模城市的合理发展，促进生产力和人口的合理分布，形成比较合理的城镇体系发挥了积极作用。现在，小城市包括建制镇已在全国广泛兴起。为了引导小城市有计划地合理发展，《城市规划法（草案）》把我国城市发展方针调整为：“控制大城市规模，合理发展中等城市和小城市”（第四条）。这将有利于使我国城市化的进程与生产力发展水平相适应。我国还处于社会主义初级阶段，为了防止城市规划中脱离国情的高标准、高指标现象的发生，必须贯彻“艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国”的精神，《城市规划法（草案）》把“城市规划必须符合我国国情，与生产力发展水平相适应，贯彻勤俭建国的方针”确定为我国城市规划的重要原则（第五条）。
    关于城市规划区，林汉雄说，城市规划区不只是城市市区的概念，还必须包括与城市长远发展密切相关的近郊区以及远离市区的城市水源地、机场、交通枢纽、电力和通讯走廊等重要基础设施的控制地段和作为城市一部分的风景名胜旅游区。否则，将造成城市外围，特别是城乡结合部建设的混乱和失控，势必严重影响城市的合理布局和正常发展。因此，《城市规划法（草案）》把城市规划区确定为“城市市区、近郊区以及城市建设和发展需要实行统一控制的区域”。同时，考虑到各地的具体情况，又规定由城市人民政府在制定总体规划时，根据上述原则，在城市总体规划方案中具体划定城市规划区的范围。这样规定，既有利于各城市根据自身的特点划定规划区，有利于城市辖区内的统一规划管理和全面、顺利地实施城市规划，又为城市的长远发展创造条件。
    关于城市规划的实施，林汉雄说，城市各项建设的规划管理是实施城市规划的基本手段。在城市规划区内建设项目的选址、定点是基本建设和征用、划拨土地的前期工作，只有由城市规划行政主管部门依照城市规划进行严格管理，才能有效地防止城市土地利用和建设布局的混乱，以实现城市规划，保证合理用地、节约用地。因此，《城市规划法（草案）》在总结我国城市规划管理经验的基础上，并与《土地管理法》协调，对城市规划区内建设项目的选址、定点等作了规定。一是规定在建设项目的可行性研究阶段，与城市规划有关的建设项目的立项、选址和布局必须符合城市规划，项目建议书和设计任务书的报批，必须附有城市规划行政主管部门的选址意见书；二是规定在城市规划区内使用土地进行建设，必须首先由城市规划行政主管部门确定建设用地的位置和范围，并发放建设用地规划许可证后，方可按《土地管理法》的规定办理征用、划拨土地手续。
