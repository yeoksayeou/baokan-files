Song Ruyuan reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the review results of the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law Draft. The draft is basically feasible and some modifications and additional regulations are suggested.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th. Song Ruyuan, Vice Chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's Congress, reported at the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 7th National People's Congress held today on the review results of the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law Draft by the Law Committee of the National People's Congress. He pointed out that the Law Committee believes that it is necessary to formulate this law to guarantee citizens' right to assemble, parade, and demonstrate in accordance with the law, and to maintain public order and social stability. The draft is basically feasible. At the same time, some modification suggestions are proposed.

Song Ruyuan said, the draft stipulates: "In order to maintain public order and social stability, to smoothly carry out the socialist modernization construction, and to guarantee citizens' right to assemble, parade, and demonstrate in accordance with the law, this law is formulated according to the Constitution." Based on everyone's opinions, it is suggested to modify it to: "In order to guarantee citizens' right to assemble, parade, and demonstrate in accordance with the law, and to maintain public order and social stability, this law is formulated according to the Constitution."

He said, it is suggested to add a clause in the general provisions: "Assemblies, parades, and demonstrations should be conducted peacefully, and no weapons, deadly weapons, or explosives should be carried, and no violence or incitement to violence should be used."

Song Ruyuan said, the draft stipulates: "Citizens shall not organize and participate in assemblies, parades, and demonstrations between different regions, different units, and different industries." Some committee members and local authorities suggested that the above provisions of the draft are not clear enough and difficult to grasp. Therefore, it is suggested to modify this clause to: "Citizens shall not organize and participate in assemblies, parades, and demonstrations held by local citizens in cities other than their place of residence."

Song Ruyuan said, some committee members and local authorities suggested that some assemblies, parades, and demonstrations do not need to apply. Therefore, it is suggested to add a clause: "Assemblies, parades, and demonstrations must be applied to the competent authorities in accordance with this law and obtain approval. The following activities do not need to apply: (1) Celebrations, commemorations, and other activities held by the state or decided by the state; (2) Activities held by state organs, political parties, social organizations, and enterprises and institutions in accordance with laws and organizational charters."

He said, the draft stipulates: "Citizens applying for assemblies, parades, and demonstrations, if they need to be resolved through consultation and dialogue, shall also attach written materials for consultation and dialogue with relevant departments." Some committee members and local authorities and departments suggested that the meaning of consultation and dialogue is not clear enough and it is difficult to make legal provisions. Therefore, it is suggested to modify the above provisions to: "If the application for holding assemblies, parades, and demonstrations requires solving specific problems, the competent authorities may, after receiving the application, notify relevant authorities or units to consult with the responsible persons of the assemblies, parades, and demonstrations to solve the problems, and may postpone the application time for 5 days."

Song Ruyuan said, some committee members and local authorities suggested that it is difficult to handle assemblies, parades, and demonstrations held due to sudden events according to the general approval procedures. Therefore, it is suggested to add provisions: "If assemblies, parades, and demonstrations are temporarily required due to sudden events, they must be immediately reported to the competent authorities; the competent authorities, after receiving the report, shall dispatch responsible personnel to their units or the scene to decide whether to permit or not to permit."

Song Ruyuan said, some local authorities, departments, and legal experts suggested that the provisions of the draft on legal responsibilities are too general and difficult to enforce, and they should be separately stipulated according to the different nature of illegal acts. Therefore, it is suggested to retain the provisions of the draft on public security administration penalties and administrative penalties, and to stipulate in principle that criminal responsibilities shall be investigated according to the law for the crimes of propagating and inciting the overthrow of the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system, obstructing state functionaries from performing their duties by violence or threat, and "looting, smashing, and burning" in crowds, as well as publicly insulting others or fabricating facts to defame others. At the same time, specific provisions are made for the application of relevant articles of the criminal law to some criminal acts, mainly: (1) Carrying weapons, deadly weapons, or explosives; (2) Surrounding and rushing state organs, causing the public affairs or state affairs of state organs to be unable to proceed normally; (3) Assemblies, parades, and demonstrations that are not applied for or applied for but not permitted in accordance with this law, or that are not conducted in accordance with the start and end time, place, and route permitted by the competent authorities, and refuse to obey the dispersal order, seriously disrupting social order; occupying public places or intercepting vehicles and pedestrians, seriously disrupting the order of public places or causing crowds to block traffic, seriously disrupting traffic order. At the same time, according to the opinions of some committee members and local authorities, a separate clause is stipulated: "Those who disrupt, rush, or otherwise disrupt assemblies, parades, and demonstrations held in accordance with the law shall be given a warning or detained for not more than 15 days; if the circumstances are serious and constitute a crime, criminal responsibilities shall be investigated according to the relevant provisions of the criminal law."

　　宋汝棼向人大常委会报告审议结果
　　集会游行示威法草案基本可行
　　提出一些修改意见　建议增加若干规定
    新华社北京10月25日电　全国人大法律委员会副主任委员宋汝棼在今天举行的七届全国人大常委会第十次会议上作全国人大法律委员会对集会游行示威法草案审议结果的报告时指出，法律委员会认为，为了保障公民依法行使集会、游行、示威的权利，维护公共秩序和社会安定，制定这个法是必要的，草案基本可行。同时，提出一些修改意见。
    宋汝棼说，草案规定：“为了维护公共秩序和社会安定，顺利地进行社会主义现代化建设，保障公民依法行使集会、游行、示威的权利，根据宪法规定，制定本法。”根据大家的意见，建议修改为：“为了保障公民依法行使集会、游行、示威的权利，维护公共秩序和社会安定，根据宪法，制定本法。”
    他说，建议在总则中增加一条：“集会、游行、示威应当和平地进行，不得携带武器、凶器和爆炸物，不得使用暴力或者煽动使用暴力。”
    宋汝棼说，草案规定：“公民不得在不同地区之间、不同单位之间、不同行业之间发动、组织和参加集会、游行、示威。”有些委员和地方提出，草案上述规定界限不够清楚，难以掌握。因此，建议将这一条修改为：“公民不得在其居住地以外的城市发动、组织和参加当地公民举行的集会、游行、示威。”
    宋汝棼说，有些委员和地方提出，有些集会、游行、示威并不需要申请，本法应作出规定。因此，建议增加一条：“举行集会、游行、示威，必须依照本法规定向主管机关提出申请并获得许可。下列活动不需申请：（一）国家举行或者根据国家决定举行的庆祝、纪念等活动；（二）国家机关、政党、社会团体、企业事业组织依照法律、组织章程进行的活动。”
    他说，草案规定：“公民申请集会、游行、示威的要求，需要通过协商对话的，还应当附与有关部门进行协商对话的书面材料。”有些委员和地方、部门提出，协商对话的含义不够清楚，不好作出法律规定。因此，建议将上述规定修改为：“申请举行集会、游行、示威要求解决具体问题的，主管机关接到申请书后，可以通知有关机关或者单位同集会、游行、示威的负责人协商解决问题，并可以将申请举行的时间推迟5日。”
    宋汝棼说，有些委员和地方提出，因突发事件举行的集会、游行、示威，按照一般的审批程序办理有困难。因此，建议增加规定：“确因突然发生的事件临时要求举行集会、游行、示威的，必须立即报告主管机关；主管机关接到报告后，应当派负责人员到其所在单位或者现场，决定许可或者不许可。”
    宋汝棼说，有些地方、部门和法律专家提出，草案关于法律责任的规定，比较笼统，难以执行，应按违法行为的不同性质分别作出规定。因此，建议除保留草案关于治安管理处罚和行政处罚的规定外，对刑法已有规定的宣传煽动推翻人民民主专政的政权和社会主义制度，以暴力、威胁方法阻碍国家工作人员依法执行职务，聚众“打砸抢”，公然侮辱他人或者捏造事实诽谤他人等犯罪行为，原则规定依法追究刑事责任，同时针对一些犯罪行为作出适用刑法有关条款的规定，主要是：（1）携带武器、凶器或者爆炸物的；（2）包围、冲击国家机关，致使国家机关的公务活动或者国事活动不能正常进行的；（3）集会、游行、示威未依照本法规定申请或者申请未获许可举行或者未按照主管机关许可的起止时间、地点、路线进行，拒不执行解散命令，严重扰乱社会秩序的；占领公共场所或者拦截车辆、行人，严重破坏公共场所秩序或者聚众堵塞交通、严重破坏交通秩序的。同时，根据有些委员和地方的意见，单独规定一条：“扰乱、冲击或者以其他方法破坏依法举行的集会、游行、示威的，处以警告或者15日以下拘留；情节严重，构成犯罪的，依照刑法有关规定追究刑事责任。”
