For a long period in human society's history, the world's population grew very slowly. Before the 20th century, the annual growth rate never exceeded 1%. However, after entering the mid-20th century, the population grew rapidly. In the early 1970s, the world's population growth rate began to decline, and in the 1980s, it continued to decline but remained within the high growth range, showing some new features.

The growth rate continues to slow, but the absolute number of people added each year is increasing, and the growth momentum remains strong.

In the late 1970s, the world's population annual growth rate was 1.82%, and in 1988, it was 1.7%, with an annual decline of only about 0.01%, which is lower than the average annual decline in the 1970s, showing a slow decline. The high growth rate of the African population has not decreased but rather increased, and the population growth rate of many populous countries remains relatively high.

In the first eight years of the 1980s, the world's population increased by an average of 89.13 million people per year, which is more than 10 million people than the average annual increase in the 1970s. It is predicted that this trend in the world's population will continue until the end of this century. Only in the next century will the annual increase in population begin to decrease, but for the first 25 years, it will still increase by 80 million people per year. According to the predictions of United Nations population experts at the beginning of this year, if the current growth rate continues, the global population may stabilize at around 10 billion people in the next 100 years. If the population is out of control, it could reach 14 billion. From this, it can be seen that the prospects for the development of the world's population are not optimistic.

The development of population in developing and developed regions is becoming increasingly imbalanced, and the population situation in developing regions is severe. In 1988, the population growth rate in developed regions had dropped to 0.6%, while in developing regions, it remained at a high level of 2.1%. The proportion of the total population in the two regions is 23.3% for the former and 76.7% for the latter, which is a decrease and increase of about 5 percentage points respectively compared to 1970, further widening the gap. The basic situation of the population in developing regions is as follows:

First, the mortality rate has basically equaled that of developed countries, but the birth rate is more than double that of developed countries, maintaining a high level of 3.1%. The population growth rate has only decreased by a few tenths of a percentage point compared to the previous decade, which is 2.5 times higher than that of developed countries. It is estimated that by the beginning of the next century, developing countries will welcome their own 5 billion population day.

Second, the population age structure is highly youthful. The proportion of people under 14 years old in the total population is close to 40%, nearly double that of developed countries. The median age is only 21 years old, which is 10 years younger than that of developed countries. Although the dependency ratio of the elderly is lower than that of developed countries, due to the heavy burden of supporting minors, the total dependency ratio reaches 70%. This means that each working-age person has to support one and a half people, while in developed countries, it is one person supporting one person.

Third, the urban population growth rate is much higher than that of developed countries. In the past eight years, the urban population growth rate in developing regions has been more than 6%, which is five times higher than that of developed regions. The urban population increases by an average of 60 million people per year, which is double that of the 1970s and six times that of developed countries.

Under the condition that developing countries are far from developed in industry, the tertiary sector, and commodity circulation, the urban population is soaring, making the abnormal development of urbanization more severe.

The contradiction between population growth and economic and social development in developing countries is becoming more acute. The high-speed population growth, abnormal youthfulness of the age structure, and rapid urban population expansion, along with other political, economic, and social factors, have led to slow economic growth, increased unemployment, food shortages, ecological destruction, and declining population quality in developing countries, forming a vicious cycle of population and development, population and ecology. This not only affects the future of developing countries but also has a very unfavorable impact on world peace and development and must be given sufficient attention.

Although the current momentum of world population growth is strong and the population situation in developing countries is still severe, it must be noted that since the 1970s, especially the 1980s, the population awareness of governments and people around the world has significantly improved; more countries are actively implementing population control policies; family planning movements are flourishing; international population aid has also increased; and great achievements have been made in the systematic engineering of controlling the world's population.

It is particularly gratifying that the fertility level of a group of developing countries has rapidly declined, and the population dynamics are gradually approaching those of developed countries. Therefore, as long as the international community, governments of all countries, and people around the world continue to make efforts, the high-speed growth of the world's population can be gradually controlled, and the relationship between population and development, population and ecology can enter a virtuous cycle.

　　八十年代世界人口发展新特点
　　李春
    在人类社会历史发展的相当长的时期里，世界人口的增长很缓慢。20世纪以前，年均增长率始终没有超出过1％。但是进入本世纪中叶后，人口急剧增长。70年代前期，世界人口增长率开始下降，80年代，持续下降，但仍未脱离高增长的范围，并且呈现出一些新的特点。
    增长速度虽继续减缓，但增加的绝对人数却进一步增多，增长势头仍然很猛。
    70年代后期，世界人口年均增长率为1.82％，1988年为1.7％，年均仅下降0.01％左右，低于70年代的年均下降幅度，呈缓慢下降状。非洲人口的高增长率有升无降，很多人口大国的人口增长速度依然较高。
    80年代的前8年，世界人口年均增加8913万人，比70年代的年均增长数多1000多万。据预测，世界人口的这一发展趋势将持续到本世纪末。只有到了下一个世纪，年增加人数才能趋于减少，但是头25年，每年仍将增加8000万人。据今年年初联合国人口委员会专家们的预测，如果按目前的增长速度，今后100年内全球人口可能稳定在100亿左右，倘若人口失控，则将达到140亿。由此看来，世界人口的发展前景是不容乐观的。
    发展中地区和发达地区人口的发展越来越不平衡，发展中地区的人口形势严峻。1988年发达地区人口增长率已降到0.6％，而发展中地区仍保持在2.1％的高水平上。两大地区人口在总人口中所占的比重，前者仅为23.3％，后者则高达76.7％，比1970年分别下降和上升了约5个百分点，差距进一步拉大了。目前发展中地区人口的基本状况是：
    第一，死亡率已与发达国家基本持平，而出生率却比发达国家高出1倍多，保持在3.1％的高水平线上。人口增长率仅比前10年下降二三个千分点，比发达国家高出2.5倍。预计到下个世纪初，发展中国家将迎来自己的50亿人口日。
    第二，人口年龄结构的高度年轻化。14岁以下的人口在总人口中所占的比重接近40％，比发达国家高出近1倍。年龄中位数只有21岁，比发达国家低10岁。尽管老年人口的扶养指数比发达国家低，但由于少年儿童人口的扶养负担过重，以致总负担指数高达70％。就是说，每一个劳动年龄人口要扶养一个半人，而发达国家则是一个人扶养一个人。
    第三，城市人口增长率比发达国家高得多。近8年来，发展中地区的城市人口增长率高达6％以上，比发达地区高5倍。城市年均增加人数高达6000万人，为70年代的2倍，为发达国家的6倍。
    发展中国家在工业、第三产业和商品流通还远未发达的条件下，城市人口如此膨胀，使得城市化的畸型发展更加严重。
    发展中国家人口增长与经济社会发展之间的矛盾更加尖锐。人口的高速增长，年龄结构的异常年轻以及城市人口的急剧膨胀等人口学因素和其他政治、经济社会因素导致发展中国家经济增长缓慢、失业加剧、粮食短缺、生态破坏、人口素质下降，形成人口与发展、人口与生态的恶性循环。这不仅关系着发展中国家的前途，也给世界的和平与发展带来极为不利的影响，必须给以充分的注意。
    虽然目前世界人口增长势头很猛，发展中国家的人口形势还很严峻，但必须看到自70年代特别是80年代以来，世界各国政府和人民的人口意识明显提高；积极推行控制人口政策的国家越来越多；家庭计划生育运动蓬勃发展；国际人口援助也有所增强；控制世界人口的系统工程取得了伟大的成就。
    特别可喜的是一批发展中国家的生育水平迅速下降，人口动态逐渐接近发达国家。因此，只要国际社会、各国政府和全世界人民坚持努力，高速度增长的世界人口就可能逐步得到控制，使人口与发展、人口与生态进入良性循环。
