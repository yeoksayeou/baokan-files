The "Red Scarf Guardians of the Railway" team is active on the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line in the northern suburbs of Wuxi, Jiangsu. After school and on holidays, the team members patrol the railway lines vigilantly.

This team was formed five years ago. On March 17, 1984, at 4:30 PM, the 1043th freight train was speeding through the Xiejie Village section of the Shanghai-Nanjing railway in the northern suburbs of Wuxi. Three students from the second grade of the second class of the Sheqiao Middle School, Xu Xiaodong, Feng Bin, and Zhang Zhiquan, were returning home from school and saw a person placing an iron bucket on the railway. Danger! The three students rushed towards the bucket, but it was too late. They heard a loud "boom" as the train hit the bucket, damaging the locomotive in multiple places and causing it to stop for 63 minutes. The direct economic loss was 27,000 yuan. After this incident, Xu Xiaodong and the other two students frequently patrolled the railway lines near Xiejie Village after school. One day, a suspicious-looking person appeared near the railway, looking around. The three students became alert. Feng Bin ran to the Huangjie Township police station to report the incident, while Xu Xiaodong and Zhang Zhiquan kept watch. At that moment, the 14th express train was approaching from Shanghai. They saw the man placing a large stone on the track. Xu Xiaodong quickly rushed onto the railway and, with all his might, lifted the stone and ran off the tracks. Just as he stepped off, the train passed by. Xu Xiaodong and Zhang Zhiquan then tightly grabbed the man and called for the railway guards. Feng Bin led the police to the scene and caught the culprit.

People praised Xu Xiaodong and the other two students as "Little Guardians of the Railway." This praise further inspired the enthusiasm of the Sheqiao Middle School Pioneers. On April 23, 1984, a "Red Scarf Guardians of the Railway" team consisting of 318 Pioneers, mainly those living along the railway, was established at Sheqiao Middle School.

The "Red Scarf Guardians of the Railway" first focused on building their own team. They invited Gao Changyou, a police officer from the Wuxi Station Police Station who served as an external mentor, to give a lecture on the importance of protecting the railway and basic knowledge of railway safety every month. This helped the team members understand that protecting the railway is a concrete expression of patriotism. At the beginning of each school year, new members of the team would listen to the stories of Xu Xiaodong and the other three Pioneers who bravely saved the train. Previously, many students liked to walk on the railway, using the tracks as a balance beam, or shooting birds with slingshots near the railway, even placing stones on the tracks to grind them into powder for fun. After becoming members of the railway protection team, they no longer did these things that were harmful to railway safety. Instead, they went out of the school gates to propagate the importance of railway protection in nearby primary schools, set up "Red Scarf Guardians of the Railway" broadcasting stations at crossings, and publish railway protection bulletin boards, educating tens of thousands of people about railway safety rules.

Sheqiao Middle School, considering the dispersed residence of the students, divided the railway protection team into 8 small groups based on natural villages, each responsible for a 4-kilometer section of the railway. They regularly inspected and evaluated the sections. About 2 kilometers west of Wuxi Station, there is a railway green belt where frequent suicides and train stoppages occurred, with tens of people from Wuxi and other places committing suicide there each year. The "Red Scarf Guardians of the Railway" used unique and emotionally appealing slogans for propaganda, which had a significant effect. Since the second half of 1984, there have been only 4 suicides. On the Shanghai-Nanjing line between K129 and K133, there used to be dozens of accidents and incidents each year, such as external injuries, vehicle accidents, placing obstacles, and stone-throwing at trains. Since 1984, there have been only 3 external injury accidents. Since the establishment of the railway protection team, they have prevented and avoided more than 50 accidents and incidents, receiving widespread praise.

    铁道小卫士
    江苏无锡市北郊的沪宁线上活跃着一支“红领巾护路队”。小队员们放学后和节假日里警惕地巡逻在铁道线上。
    这支护路队诞生于5年前。1984年3月17日下午4时30分，1043次货物列车正风驰电掣般地在沪宁铁路无锡北郊谢巷村境内急驶。社桥中学初二（2）中队少先队员徐晓东、冯斌和张志清放学回家路过这里，只见一个人将一只铁桶搬上了铁路。危险！三人毫不犹豫冲向铁桶，但为时已晚，只听“轰”的一声，列车撞上了铁桶，机车多处损坏，被迫停车63分钟，造成直接经济损失2.7万元。这以后，徐晓东等三名少先队员放学后，经常到谢巷村附近的铁道线上巡视。一天，一个贼头贼脑的人来到铁路旁东张西望。徐晓东三人警觉起来。冯斌拔腿跑去向附近的黄巷乡派出所报告，徐晓东、张志清在现场监视。这时，14次特快列车从上海方向开来，只见那个坏蛋抱起一块大石头放在钢轨上。徐晓东迅速冲上铁路，用尽全身力气抱起大石头往外跑。他刚跑出铁轨，火车就擦身而过。徐晓东和张志清将那个坏家伙一边紧紧抱住，一边大声呼唤护路工。冯斌领着民警及时赶到，捉住了坏人。
    人们称赞徐晓东等三名少先队员是“铁路小卫士”。赞扬又激发了社桥中学少先队员们的护路热情。1984年4月23日，社桥中学一支以居住在铁路沿线的少先队员为主体，共有318人组成的“红领巾护路队”成立了。
    “红领巾护路队”首先是抓自身队伍建设。他们每月请担任校外辅导员的无锡站派出所民警高昌友讲爱路的重要性和护路的基本常识，使护路队员懂得了爱护铁路就是爱国的具体表现。每当新学年开学，新加入的护路队员都要聆听徐晓东等3名少先队员奋勇救列车的事迹介绍。以前，不少学生喜欢在铁路上行走，拿钢轨当作平衡木，有的用弹弓在铁路旁打鸟，甚至在轨面上放石子碾石粉，以此取乐。自从担任护路队员后，他们再也不干这些不利于铁路安全的错事了，而且走出校门，到附近小学进行爱路护路宣传，在道口设立红领巾护路广播站，出护路黑板报，使成千上万的人知道了铁路的安全规则。
    社桥中学根据学生居住分散的特点，将护路队员以自然村为单位，分为8个护路小组，对全长4公里的铁路实行分段包管制，定期检查评比。距无锡站以西2公里处有片铁路绿化带，经常发生人亡车停事故，每年总有十几个乃至几十个本市和外地人来此处寻短见。“红领巾护路队”利用别具一格，富有感情的标语进行宣传，发挥了巨大作用。自1984年下半年以来，这里寻短见的仅有4个。在沪宁线K129、K133区段，过去每年都要发生几十起路外伤亡、车辆肇事、置放障碍、石击列车等事故、事件，1984年以来仅发生3起路外伤亡事故。自护路队成立以来，共防止和避免了事故、事件50余起，受到了广泛的赞扬。　　何水根
