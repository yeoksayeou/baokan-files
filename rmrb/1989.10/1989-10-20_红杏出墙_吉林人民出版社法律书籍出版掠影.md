On September 7th, in the solemn Great Hall of the People in the capital Beijing, the "Compendium of Laws of the People's Republic of China" was launched. Comrade Qiao Shi and other national leaders attended and conveyed the congratulations of Comrade Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee.

Premier Li Peng sent a message saying, "The publication of this book will play a certain role in promoting the development of democracy and legal construction in our country."

This monumental work, highly valued and praised by national leaders, known as the first legal compendium of New China, was not published by a national-level publishing department or a professional publishing house, but by the Jilin People's Publishing House in the northern region. It can be said that this achievement is not a mere opportunity for them, but the crystallization of their ten-year adherence to the correct publishing direction and hard work.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, the Jilin People's Publishing House, this garden of a hundred flowers, has published more than a hundred legal books, spreading its fragrance throughout the vast cities and countryside of our country. In factories, in rural areas, in offices, and in schools, books such as "Worker's Legal Knowledge Reader," "Farmer's Legal Knowledge Reader," "Legal Knowledge for Cadres," and "Legal Knowledge for Youth" have, like magical keys, opened the doors to the legal world for people.

Among them, "Legal Knowledge for Cadres" has sold nearly one million copies and was rated as one of the best-selling books in 1986. "Fundamentals of Law and Administrative Law" and "Reform of Enterprise Management Methods and Law" also won excellent book awards.

In a market economy, publishing books to make money seems natural. However, the Jilin People's Publishing House never makes money that harms professional ethics.

When martial arts and obscene publications were popular in society, some people also brought manuscripts that could make a lot of money to the door, but they did not deviate from the highest principle of social benefits.

They do not make money that harms conscience, and sometimes publishing books even results in losses. For example, they lost 20,000 yuan on the book "General Theory of Criminal Law." This book is of great academic value and fills a gap in China's legal publications.

However, "sun and moon are bright," the circulation is only a few thousand copies. Despite this, the book still brought joy to legal scholars. After the book was published, it was warmly welcomed by relevant parties, and some scholars even wrote reviews for it.

In recent years, legal dictionaries and monographs such as "Law Dictionary" and "Historical Records of Criminal Law" published by them have been praised by scholars and research and teaching personnel in their letters for contributing to the promotion of legal research and legal construction in our country.

With the improvement of China's legal system, legal publications have entered a period of unprecedented prosperity. To further improve the quality of books and make the selection of topics more targeted, they pay attention to social investigations, deeply listen to opinions from the legal community, and strengthen horizontal contacts to understand the needs of various relevant departments for legal books.

The "Compendium of Laws," which has attracted the attention of the publishing and legal communities nationwide, was inspired by social investigations. Because of its targeted approach, the legal books published by this publishing house are at the forefront among the hundreds of legal books published by more than a hundred publishing houses nationwide and are welcomed by readers.

"Spring colors cannot be contained, a red plum blossom peeks over the wall." It is believed that in the era of reform, the Jilin People's Publishing House will have more "red plums" like the "Compendium of Laws" blooming over the wall, adding new spring colors to the garden of socialist spiritual civilization.

    红杏出墙
    ——吉林人民出版社法律书籍出版掠影
    韩萍
    今年9月7日。首都北京庄严的人民大会堂。
      《中华人民共和国法律全书》在这里举行首发式。乔石等国家领导人出席并转达了江泽民总书记的祝贺。
    李鹏总理致信说：“该书的出版对于推动我国的民主与法制建设，将起到一定的作用。”
    这部受到国家领导人高度重视高度评价的，被称之为新中国第一部法律大典的巨著，既非出自国家级出版部门，也不是出自专业出版社，而是出自北国的吉林人民出版社。可以说，这项成果的获得对他们来说并不是一种机遇，而是他们十年来坚持正确的出版方向，挥洒辛勤汗水的结　晶。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，吉林人民出版社——这座出版了上百种法律书籍的百花园，几乎把它的馨香传遍了我国广袤的城乡。在工厂，在农村，在机关，在学校，那通俗易懂的《工人法律常识读本》、《农民法律常识读本》、《干部法律知识》、《青少年法律常识读本》等书籍，像一把把神奇的钥匙，把人们引进了那未曾涉足的法律大门。
    其中《干部法律知识》发行近一千万册，被评为1986年全国畅销书。《法学基础与行政法》和《企业经营方式改革与法》等书籍也都分别荣获优秀图书奖。
    出书赚钱，这在商品经济中似乎是天经地义的事。但吉林人民出版社却从不赚有损职业道德的钱。
    当武侠、淫秽书刊在社会风行的时候，也有人把一些很能赚钱的书稿送上门来，但他们却没有为此偏离坚持社会效益这个最高宗旨。
    昧良心钱不赚，有时出书却还要陪钱。如《刑法通论》一书他们就赔了2万元。这部书在学术上极有价值，又填补了我国法律书籍的一项空白。
    然而“阳春白雪”，发行量只有几千册。尽管如此，这本书依然令法律学者们惊喜。该书出版后，受到有关人士的热烈欢迎，有的学者还为此书撰写了书评。
    几年来，经他们出版的《法学大词典》、《历代刑法志》等许多法律词典专著，一些学者、科研教学人员在来信中称赞他们为推动我国法律研究、法制建设做出了贡献。
    随着我国法制建设的健全，法律书籍出现了空前繁荣的局面。为进一步提高图书质量，使选题有针对性，他们注重社会调查，深入法学界听取意见，同时加强横向联系，了解各有关部门对法律书籍的需求。
    受到全国出版界和法律界关注的《法律全书》，就是在社会调查中触发选题灵感的。因为有的放矢，这家出版社出版的法律书籍在全国上百家出版社出版的数百种法律书籍中名列前茅，并受到读者的欢迎。
    “满园春色关不住，一只红杏出墙来。”相信在改革的年代里，吉林人民出版社会有更多像《法律全书》这样的“红杏”探出墙外，为社会主义精神文明之园增添新的春色。
