	Reform and opening up with anti-corruption and integrity go hand in hand. Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory operates actively with good factory discipline.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 5th – (Reporter Wu Fumin) A typical example of reform and opening up, a model of integrity and self-discipline. Some people see these two concepts as incompatible, but at Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory, they achieve harmonious unity.

	As a reform pilot unit in the city, Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory has a relatively high degree of autonomy in operations, distribution, foreign trade, investment, personnel, and other aspects. The factory leadership is keenly aware that under the current conditions where commodity economy regulations are not yet perfect, implementing open operations will inevitably subject the enterprise to a double test: one is the test of competition, and the other is the test of corruption. Therefore, for every autonomy gained, they formulate corresponding restraint measures to ensure that the enterprise can compete freely while ensuring that relevant personnel strictly adhere to laws and regulations, maintaining a good image for socialist enterprises. They have also established the concept of "high-efficiency competition," focusing on improving economic efficiency primarily in the production process. In 1987 and 1988, the labor productivity per capita increased by 19% and 13.5% respectively compared to the previous year, which is 1.23 times higher than the national first-class enterprise standard in the textile machinery industry.

	Strengthening internal management is the foundation for the enterprise to maintain integrity. This factory does not limit its efforts to integrity to merely calling on everyone to hand in gifts and gift money, but rather focuses on improving various management systems. For all aspects that are prone to errors, such as cash management, external cooperation, product sales, and blueprint sales, they have formulated strict regulations. In the past two years, this factory has formulated more than 30 regulations, systems, and codes of conduct based on the actual production and operation activities of the enterprise, and frequently gives warnings to relevant personnel, effectively controlling various forms of embezzlement and bribery. To date, this large enterprise with more than 4,000 people has not discovered a single economic crime case.

	The practice of Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory shows that the opening up and activation of enterprises and integrity are not contradictory. For example, although this factory has formulated dozens of restraint measures for operational activities, the operational personnel feel that these regulations only restrict illegal and disciplinary behaviors, and normal operations still have considerable freedom, allowing everyone to showcase their talents, so the operational activities of the enterprise are always vibrant.

	The reason why Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory can take the lead in integrity and self-discipline, and anti-corruption is that the factory director, Huang Guan, can take the lead in implementing the "Ten Self-Restraint Rules for the Factory Director." In operational work, he does not show favoritism. At the same time, the factory party committee plays a guiding and supervisory role in maintaining the integrity of the enterprise, and the discipline inspection committee and trade union also perform their respective supervisory and inspection functions. The joint efforts of all parties ensure the normal operation of the enterprise's self-restraint mechanism, supervision mechanism, and feedback mechanism, thus forming a good tradition of integrity within the entire factory.

	By focusing on anti-corruption and promoting integrity, Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory has cohesion internally and attractiveness externally, and production is thriving.

### 改革开放与反腐倡廉并行不悖  上海二纺机厂经营活厂风好

    改革开放与反腐倡廉并行不悖
    上海二纺机厂经营活厂风好
    新华社上海10月5日电（记者吴复民）改革开放的典型，廉洁自律的模范。一些人眼里不甚相容的这两个概念，在上海第二纺织机械厂达到和谐的统一。
    上海第二纺织机械厂作为全市的改革试点单位，在经营、分配、外贸、投资、人事等方面都拥有较多的自主权。厂领导清醒地意识到，在目前商品经济法规不健全的条件下，实行放开经营必然使企业面临双重考验：一是竞争风浪的考验，二是腐败的考验。因此，他们每获得一项自主权，就制订相应的制约措施，既保证企业能放开手脚参与竞争，又保证有关人员严守法纪，保持社会主义企业的良好形象。他们还确立“高效竞争”的观念，把提高经济效益的着眼点主要放在生产环节上。1987、1988两年，全员劳动生产率分别比上年提高19％和13.5％，比纺机行业国家一级企业标准高1.23倍。
    加强内部管理，是企业保持清正廉洁的根基。这个厂抓廉洁，不只局限在号召大家上缴礼品、礼金，而是把主要精力放在完善各项管理制度上。凡是容易出纰漏的环节，如现金管理、对外协作、产品销售、图纸出售等，他们都制订了严密的规章守则。近两年来，这个厂从企业生产经营活动的实际出发，制订了30多份规章、制度、守则，并经常给有关人员打“预防针”，使各种形式的贪污受贿都得到有效控制。迄今为止，这个4000多人的大型企业，没有发现一起经济犯罪案件。
    上海第二纺织机械厂的实践表明，企业的开放搞活和清正廉洁是并行不悖的。例如，尽管这个厂对经营活动制订了几十条制约措施，但是经营人员感到，这些条例捆死的只是违法违纪行为，正常的经营仍有相当的自由度，每个人都可以施展才能，因而企业的经营活动始终搞得有声有色。
    上海第二纺织机械厂所以能在廉洁自律、反对腐败方面先行一步，关键是厂长黄关从能带头执行《厂长自我制约十条守则》，在经营工作中不徇私情。同时，厂党委在保持企业廉洁中发挥导向和保证监督作用，纪委、工会也履行各自的监督、检查职能。各方合力使企业内部的自我约束机制、监督机制和反馈机制得以正常运行，从而在全厂形成了清正廉洁的好作风。
    抓了反腐倡廉，上海第二纺织机械厂对内有了凝聚力，对外有了吸引力，生产蒸蒸日上。
