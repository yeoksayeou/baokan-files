In the 50-plus days of turmoil, 29 students from Fudan University submitted applications to join the Party and submitted their reports to the Party organization. They said: "If at a time when the Party's authority is severely damaged, we do not express our beliefs and pursue our aspirations, we would lose the stance of a true patriot."

Fudan University was one of the political whirlpools of the turmoil in Shanghai. On the morning of May 19, instigated by the illegal organization "Shanghai Autonomous Federation of University Students," some people posted "Declaration of Withdrawal from the Party" and "Declaration of Refusal to Join the Party" at the school gate. Some people wavered, some were hesitant. Facing such an atmosphere, 29 students successively applied to join the Party, with mature thoughts and firm beliefs, dedicating precious loyalty and filial hearts to weather the storm with the Party.

Looking through the Party application letters of these students, one is deeply impressed by their sincere feelings towards the Party. Liu Gang, a student of the History Department, Class of 1987, said: "History has repeatedly proven that our Party has always been the core leadership representing the interests of the entire nation and the hope for the country's development. The Party gave the people the consciousness of standing up and becoming masters of their own country for the first time, the national consciousness of taking the socialist road for the first time, and the national consciousness of standing independently in the world for the first time... Therefore, adhering to the Party's leadership is an undeniable political reality and historical choice for China."

Among them are members of the "Future Journalists Group" — Wu Yuehua and Liang Hong from the Journalism Department. After traveling 20,000 miles and gaining a solid understanding of China's national conditions, these two university students realized: "University students sitting and talking, indulging in empty talk. Today, China needs real, diligent, and hardworking work. The spirit of sacrifice and dedication of the soldiers on the southern border, and the qualities of ordinary Party members in various industries who work tirelessly in their ordinary jobs, have deeply moved us. We young people must shoulder the responsibility of building our country, and we must have a firm belief to support us in facing various tests. This realization prompted us to have the solemn pursuit of becoming Communist Party members." On May 20, after visiting the martyrs' cemetery at the Old Mountain Front, they each wrote a 3,000-4,000-word Party application letter, expressing their desire to join the Party to the Party organization.

Among them are also students who reflected early and had a faster understanding, such as the secretary of the Chemical Department's Youth League branch, Wang Jiangping, and the Youth League member of the Law Department, Liu Songqing. They believe that in recent years, some university students have indulged in the self-feeling of "the world is drunk, but I am sober," regarding themselves as saviors, and have extreme individualism and bourgeois liberalization tendencies.

They said, although there are indeed some corrupt phenomena within the Party, the Party, on the whole, is a party that serves the people wholeheartedly. Our understanding of the Party should rise to a rational level, so that our beliefs can withstand the tests of wind and rain.

It is reported that since the new semester, 51 more students from Fudan University have submitted Party application letters to the Party organization.

    奉献赤子之心　与党同舟共济
    复旦29名学生动乱中申请入党
    新华社上海10月13日电　（通讯员路晨、记者刘军）在50多天的动乱风波中，复旦大学先后有29位学生提出入党申请，向党组织递交思想汇报。他们说：“如果在党的威信受到严重损害的关头，不表示我们的信念、提出我们的追求，就丧失了一个真正爱国者的立场。”
    复旦大学是上海地区动乱的政治漩涡之一。5月19日上午，在非法组织“高自联”的煽动下，有人在校门口贴出《退党声明》和《拒斥入党声明》，有人动摇，有人徬徨。面对这样的气氛，29位同学先后向党组织提出入党申请，凭着成熟的思考和坚定的信念，向党奉献了可贵的忠诚和共渡难关的赤子之心。
    翻开这些学生的入党申请书，使人深深感佩他们对党的坦诚情怀。历史系87级学生刘罡说：“历史一再证明，我们党始终是最能够代表全民族利益和国家发展希望的领导核心。党使人民第一次有了翻身当家作主的意识，第一次有了走社会主义道路的国家意识，第一次有了独立于世界之林的民族意识……因此，坚持党的领导是中国不可置疑的政治现实和历史选择。”
    他们当中有“未来记者团”成员——新闻系的吴月华、梁泓，这两位大学生在行程二万里、脚踏实地了解中国国情后认识到：“大学生坐而论道，流于空谈。今天中国需要的是实实在在、勤勤恳恳的工作。南疆战士的牺牲奉献精神，各行各业普通党员在平凡工作中任劳任怨的品质，都使我们感受至深。我们青年人要承担起建设祖国的重任，就必须有一种牢固的信仰支持我们去面对各种考验，这种认识促使我们产生成为共产党员的庄严追求。”5月20日，她们俩在老山前线参观烈士陵园后，分别写了三四千字的入党申请书，向党组织倾诉自己追求入党的意愿。
    他们当中还有反思较早，认识提高较快，在非常时刻毅然提出入党申请的化学专业团支部书记王江萍、法律专业共青团员柳颂清等同学。他们认为，近年来有些大学生沉湎于“举世皆醉我独醒”的自我感觉中，以救世主自居，存在着极端个人主义和资产阶级民主化倾向。
    他们说，尽管在党内确实存在一些腐败现象，但我们党从总体上来说是全心全意为人民服务的党。我们对党的认识应上升到理性高度，这样我们的信念才经得起风风雨雨的考验。
    据悉，新学期以来，复旦大学又有51名学生向党组织递交了入党申请书。
