The Trick Under the Weighing Stone

Yuan Yun from Shanxi Province, Pinglu County writes: During the summer grain procurement period, the head of the Forestry Station in Sanmen Township, Chai Guojiang, and a villager from Jiaowuo Village, Su Qiyuan, discovered two magnets placed under the weighing pan of the grain procurement scale at the Sanmen Township Grain Station when they were turning in their public grain. They immediately asked the scale operator about it, but the operator had no answer. Many farmers complained that the amount of grain they weighed at the township grain station did not match the amount they weighed at home. A villager from Huangdui Village, Gao Yunchen, said: he weighed 597 kilograms of wheat at home, but when he weighed it at the grain station, it was 23 kilograms less; the deputy secretary of the Party branch in Yan Di Village, Wu Ke Liang, weighed 150.5 kilograms of wheat at home to turn in as public grain, but on the grain station's scale, it was only 126 kilograms; a villager from Guo Village, Yang Zhulan, weighed 50 kilograms of wheat at home, but on the grain station's scale, it became 44 kilograms...

Deng Zhen from Henan Province, Dengzhou City, Gaoji Township writes: On the afternoon of August 9th, at the Luying Tobacco Station in Gaoji Township, Dengzhou City, I saw: an old man placed a package of tobacco leaves on the scale. "22 kilograms," the person weighing it reported the weight of the tobacco leaves. The old man said in surprise, "That's not right, comrade! I weighed it at home, and the scale showed 25.5 kilograms, but the pointer was still high up!" "Then take it back home!" the person weighing it impatiently retorted. The old man helplessly sold the tobacco. At this moment, a middle-aged man placed a large package of tobacco leaves on the scale, and it weighed "42.5 kilograms." This middle-aged man said, "I just weighed it and it was 45.5 kilograms, how did it suddenly become 3 kilograms less? Weigh it again!" "Weigh what?" the person weighing it replied. This middle-aged man stepped forward and looked at the bottom of the weighing stone, suddenly lifting the cover to reveal a magnet underneath! The person weighing it was taken aback and stood there stunned.

    秤砣下的名堂
    山西平陆县　员　云来信：夏粮收购期间，我县三门乡林业站站长柴国江和将窝村村民苏启渊等人缴公粮时，发现三门乡粮站收购粮食的磅砣底盘放有两块吸铁石。他们当即问过磅员怎么回事，过磅员无言以答。不少农民反映，他们在乡粮站称的粮食的数量与在家称的数量不符。黄堆村村民高运成说：他从家里称了597公斤小麦，到粮站一称，竟少了23公斤；淹底村党支部副书记吴克亮，从家里称了150.5公斤小麦缴公粮，在粮站的磅秤上只有126公斤；过村村民杨竹兰，在家里称了50公斤小麦，在粮站的磅秤上成了44公斤……
    河南邓州市高集乡　邓　镇来信：8月9日下午，在邓州市高集乡吕营烟站，我看到：一位老汉把一包烟叶放到磅秤上。“22公斤”，过磅的人报出了烟叶的重量。老汉吃惊地说：“不对吧，同志！我在家称过，秤砣打到25.5公斤，秤杆还是高高的！”“那你拿回家好啦！”过磅的人不耐烦地甩出一句。老汉无可奈何地把烟卖了。这时，一位中年男子把一大包烟叶放到磅秤上，一称，“42.5公斤。”这个中年人说：“刚称过是45.5公斤，怎么一下子就短了3公斤？你再称称！”“称啥？”过磅人答道。这个中年人跨上一步，盯着磅砣底盘，突然伸手把磅砣底盘盖揭开，一块吸铁石露了出来！过磅人惊慌失措，呆若木鸡。
