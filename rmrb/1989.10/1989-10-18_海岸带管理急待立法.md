Recently, I conducted a short-term investigation in Zhangjia Pu, Wendeng City, Shandong Province, and discovered that the Changhui Port Channel has been severely impacted by irrational engineering development.

Zhangjia Pu Bay is a narrow-mouthed, wide-bodied bay with a vast anchorage area and a deep, smooth channel, making it an excellent shelter harbor. It has played a significant role in the maritime and fisheries production of Wendeng City and even Shandong Province. However, this excellent harbor has recently been severely affected by the predatory development of aquaculture and other fisheries projects. The port has experienced accelerated siltation, disrupted hydrodynamic conditions, and ecological imbalance. Large areas of water have turned into land, increasing the burden of dredging and worsening water and sediment quality. The self-purification capacity of the seawater is gradually weakening. Currently, some township enterprises, without scientific verification and feasibility studies, have built several stone dikes at the narrow mouth of the bay, severely blocking the bay's throat and obstructing the smooth flow of tidal currents into the bay, posing a fatal threat to the bay's survival.

In recent years, the phenomenon of indiscriminate land reclamation in bays has become increasingly prevalent. These coastal engineering projects, lacking unified planning and scientific verification, have severely damaged the natural environment, significantly impacting local production and residents' lives. Some species have decreased or become extinct. It is hoped that relevant departments will promptly formulate regulations for coastal management, determine the enforcement agency, clarify the approval procedures for coastal development projects, and so on.

    海岸带管理急待立法
    最近，我到山东文登市张家埠进行短期考察，发现长会口航道由于不合理的工程开发，造成了严重问题。
    张家埠湾是个口窄腹阔的海湾，湾内锚地广阔，航道深顺，是个很好的避风港，在文登市乃至山东省的航运及渔业生产中发挥过巨大的作用。然而，这个优良港湾，近来由于水产养殖和其他渔业工程的掠夺性开发，造成港口沉淤加剧，动力条件失调，生态平衡遭到破坏，大片大片的水域变成陆地，港口疏浚负担急剧加重，水质泥质恶化，海水自净能力日渐微弱。目前，有些乡镇企业在没有科学论证和可行性研究的情况下，在港湾的隘口处伸出几条堆石丁坝，严重堵塞了海湾的咽喉，阻碍了潮流入口的畅通，给海湾的生存带来致命的危害。
    近几年来，一些地方乱填海湾的现象越来越多。那些缺乏统一规划，缺乏科学论证的海岸工程，严重破坏了自然环境，给当地生产和居民生活带来很大影响，部分生物已减少或灭绝。希望有关部门抓紧制订海岸带管理法规，确定主管执法部门，明确海岸带开发工程的审批手续，等等。
