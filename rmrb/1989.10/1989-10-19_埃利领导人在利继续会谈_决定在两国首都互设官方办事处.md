Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi held two rounds of talks in Matrouh and Tobruk on October 16th and 17th, "opening a new chapter in Egypt-Libya relations."

Both Mubarak and Gaddafi expressed satisfaction with the results of the talks. The joint statement from the talks stipulated: citizens of both countries can travel freely with their national IDs; landline and wireless communication networks will be connected, and land and sea transportation will be coordinated; cooperation will be explored in energy supply, trade, freshwater development, and agricultural reclamation in border areas; and extensive exchanges will be conducted in oil exploration, medical and health care, and technical expertise.

President Mubarak stated that Egypt and Libya have no differences on Arab affairs, and that past disagreements were only in "tactics and strategies." Local media noted that the talks did not explicitly announce the resumption of formal diplomatic relations. The Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram reported that the two leaders reached an agreement to establish official offices in each other's capitals.

    埃利领导人在利继续会谈
    决定在两国首都互设官方办事处
    本报开罗10月18日电　记者林皎明报道：埃及总统穆巴拉克与利比亚领导人卡扎菲10月16日和17日在马特鲁和图卜鲁格的两轮会谈，“打开埃利两国关系新的一页”。
    穆巴拉克和卡扎菲两位领导人对会谈成果满意。会谈公报规定：两国公民凭本国身份证自由往来；接通两国有线、无线通讯网，筹备路海交通的衔接；在边境地区能源供应、贸易往来、淡水源开发、农业垦殖场等方面研究合作；在石油勘探、医疗卫生、技术专家等方面广泛交流。
    穆巴拉克总统表示，埃利两国在阿拉伯事业问题上没有分歧，过去只在“方针和策略上”存在不同意见。此间新闻界注意到，这次会谈没有明确宣布恢复正式外交关系。埃及《金字塔报》报道，两国领导人达成协议，在对方首都设立本国官方办事处。
