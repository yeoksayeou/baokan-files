Dalian organizes a special team to clean up enterprise working capital.

The Dalian municipal government recently organized a team composed of people's representatives and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who are knowledgeable about finance, as well as professionals from various banks and large enterprises, to conduct a comprehensive audit of working capital. This effort aims to push the "double increase and double savings" movement to a deeper level.

Since the beginning of this year, Dalian's industrial and agricultural production, as well as various construction projects, have encountered numerous difficulties. Among these, the most prominent issue is the severe shortage of working capital, particularly in enterprises. According to statistics from the beginning of the year on 99 industrial enterprises, the annual working capital shortfall reached 540 million yuan. In response to this situation, the municipal leadership has focused on tapping into the internal financial potential of enterprises as a key measure. In April, they invited and selected over 200 people to form 20 investigation teams to begin auditing the working capital usage of 200 key industrial and commercial enterprises.

For this purpose, the municipal government established a leading group to determine the main content of the audit, which includes: accumulated and excess inventory of materials, products, and commodities, water in working capital, and occupied, misappropriated, and overdue funds. The enterprises first conducted self-inspections, followed by re-inspections and acceptance by the municipal investigation teams. After several months of work, just in terms of stagnant funds, 1.18 billion yuan was identified, and lost funds also amounted to over 70 million yuan.

Due to the clarification of the situation and the identification of potential, the Dalian municipal government recently held a special meeting to decide, while addressing the various issues exposed in the initial audit of 200 enterprises, to continue organizing efforts to conduct a comprehensive audit of the working capital of all 3,000 enterprises in the city.

    大连组织专门班子清理企业流动资金
    本报讯　大连市政府最近组织由懂金融的人民代表、政协委员，以及各银行、大企业专业人员参加的调查组，全面清理流动资金，推动“双增双节”运动向纵深发展。
    今年以来，大连市的工农业生产和各项建设事业遇到诸多困难，其中，资金紧张特别是企业流动资金严重短缺是最突出的矛盾。据年初对99个工业企业的统计，全年流动资金缺口达5.4亿元。针对这种情况，市领导眼睛向内，把挖掘企业内部资金潜力列为一项关键措施。4月，他们邀请和抽调200多人组成20个调查组，开始清理200个重点工商企业流动资金的占用情况。
    为此，市政府成立了领导小组，确定清理的内容主要包括：积压和超储物资、产品、商品，流动资金水分，挤占挪用拖欠资金等。先由各企业自查，市调查组复查、验收。经过几个月的工作，仅呆滞资金一项，就查出11.8亿元，流失资金也高达7000多万元。
    由于摸清了底数，看到了潜力，大连市府前不久专门召开会议，决定在解决好先期清理的200个企业暴露出多种问题的同时，继续组织力量，对全市3000家企业的流动资金进行全面清理。　（翟边建）
