Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 12th.

The renowned institution Beijing University is set to commence its new academic year on October 14th. The preparations for the new semester have been completed. This year, 748 freshmen have been enrolled, and they have already reported to the Shijiazhuang Army Academy for a one-year political and military training program starting from October 12th. A total of 914 graduate students have been admitted, including 127 doctoral students and 787 master's students, who will soon report to the university for enrollment. Additionally, over 260 international students from more than 30 countries have also begun to arrive.

Beijing University was severely affected by the recent turmoil and unrest, with a significant number of students and a few faculty members involved. The school's reputation has been somewhat tarnished, and students have suffered considerable academic losses. Following the turmoil, the university's Party Committee organized multiple study sessions for cadres, party members, faculty, graduates, and student leaders to learn from the spirit of the 14th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and Jiang Zemin's National Day speech. The goal was to raise awareness, unify thoughts, summarize experiences and lessons, and boost morale to better manage Beijing University. Through these study sessions, the majority have gained a new understanding of the nature, roots, and correct decisions of the Party Central Committee regarding the turmoil and unrest, gradually aligning their thoughts with the spirit of the 14th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee.

During the study sessions, participants reflected on the university's actual situation, summarized experiences and lessons, and considered how to better manage Beijing University. They reached the following four conclusions: First, it is crucial to recognize the importance, long-term nature, and complexity of the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, and to enhance awareness in this regard. Beijing University is a significant cultural front, with comprehensive disciplines, extensive connections, and timely information. Internationally, the infiltration and counter-infiltration of ideas and culture are long-term and complex, inevitably reflecting within the school. Domestically, those who persistently hold bourgeois liberalization views are always trying to interfere with Beijing University. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to persistently oppose bourgeois liberalization to better manage Beijing University. Second, it is essential to correct the guiding ideology of education, adhere to the socialist direction, and strengthen Marxist theoretical and ideological-political education for students. This work has weakened in recent years, contributing to the unrest at Beijing University. Third, it is necessary to correctly understand and promote the traditions of Beijing University and further strengthen school management. Those promoting bourgeois liberalization exploited students' one-sided understanding of Beijing University's traditions and the school's lax management to incite unrest. Fourth, it is vital to strengthen the Party's construction within the school. Beijing University has over 4,600 Communist Party members, with the majority being good. However, the Party organization's combat effectiveness is weak. To better manage Beijing University, it is necessary to build the university's Party organization into a strong political core. Learning and reflection have prepared the necessary thoughts and politics for the start of the new academic year.

Beijing University has also made extensive preparations for the new academic year. Firstly, the teaching plan has been adjusted. The unrest has significantly impacted students' academic progress, with four months of missed classes. Upon resumption, classes will first focus on catching up, followed by examinations, and then proceed with the new academic year's curriculum. Ideological and political education will be strengthened. Due to the large volume of catch-up classes, some elective courses will be reduced. The school has arranged for nearly 800 teachers, half of whom are professors or associate professors, to conduct in-depth ideological and political education among students. To improve the living conditions of young teachers, nearly 400 sets of faculty dormitories have been completed and will soon be put into use. To enrich students' extracurricular activities, a 5,000-square-meter student activity center is nearing completion and will be available for use this semester. The newly built rainproof sports field has also been completed. Additionally, classrooms and laboratory facilities have been repaired, and student dormitories have been renovated.

### 反思过去考虑未来　吸取教训振奋精神  北大积极做好新学年开学准备

    反思过去考虑未来　吸取教训振奋精神
    北大积极做好新学年开学准备
    本报北京10月12日讯　记者毕全忠报道：著名学府北京大学定于10月14日开学，现已做好新学年开学的各项准备。今年招收的748名本科新生，已直接到石家庄陆军学院报到，从10月12日开始为期一年的政治、军事训练。今年招收的研究生有914名，其中博士生127名，硕士生787名，将于近日到本校报到入学。新招收的来自30多个国家的260多名外国留学生，也已陆续报到。
    北京大学是这次学潮、动乱的“重灾区”，卷入的学生较多，教师中也有少数人介入，学校的声誉受到一定影响，学生的学业损失较大。风波之后，学校党委先后组织干部、党员、教职工和毕业生、学生干部学习党的十三届四中全会精神和江泽民总书记的国庆讲话，以提高认识，统一思想，总结经验教训，振奋精神办好北大。经过学习，绝大多数人对这次动乱和暴乱的性质、根源及党中央的正确决策有了新的认识，思想逐步统一到党的十三届四中全会的精神上来。
    在学习中，大家根据北大的实际认真反思，总结经验教训，考虑如何办好北大，比较一致地得出以下四点结论：一是要认识反对资产阶级自由化斗争的重要性、长期性和复杂性，提高反对资产阶级自由化的自觉性。北京大学是重要的文化阵地，学科齐全，联系广泛，信息灵通。从国际上看，思想、文化的渗透与反渗透是长期、复杂的，必然要反映到学校里来；从国内看，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人总是千方百计插手北大。因此，坚持不懈地反对资产阶级自由化，对办好北大具有特别重大的意义。二是要进一步端正办学指导思想，坚持社会主义方向，加强对学生的马克思主义理论教育和思想政治工作。近几年，这项工作削弱了，这正是北大发生学潮、动乱的原因之一。三是要正确认识和宣传北大的传统，进一步加强学校管理。搞资产阶级自由化的人正是利用了学生对北大传统的片面认识和北大管理不严、比较自由散漫的弱点，大肆进行煽动的。四是要加强学校党的建设。北大有4600多名共产党员，大多数是好的，但党组织的战斗力不强。要办好北大，必须把北大的党组织建设成坚强的政治核心。学习和反思，为新学年的开始作了必要的思想、政治准备。
    北京大学还为新学年的开始做了其它大量的准备工作。首先是调整了教学计划。学潮、动乱使学生的学业受到很大影响，四个月没有上课。开学后将先补课，然后考试，再进行新学年课程的教学。思想政治教育将得到加强。因补课量很大，一些选修课将适当削减。学校安排近800名教师到学生中去进行深入的思想政治教育。这些教师中，教授、副教授占一半。为改善青年教师的居住条件，近400套教职工宿舍建成，即将启用。为丰富学生的课余生活，一座5000平方米的学生活动中心接近竣工，本学期内即可使用。新建的风雨操场已建成。此外，还检修了教室和实验室设施，学生宿舍也进行了修缮。
