The Supreme People's Procuratorate, Liu Fuzhi, stated that from the numerous reports and cases handled by the procuratorate, it is evident that corruption and bribery are indeed severe issues. These corrupt practices pose a significant threat to the health of our party organizations and state institutions, and they severely undermine the Four Modernizations, the Four Cardinal Principles, and the policy of reform and opening up. The procuratorate must fully recognize the gravity of this situation and prepare for a long-term battle. In handling cases, the procuratorate must adhere to the principles of facts as the basis, law as the criterion, and equality before the law. All suspicious leads must be thoroughly investigated, and anyone found guilty, regardless of their status, must be dealt with strictly according to the law without leniency.

Liu Fuzhi emphasized that the fight against corruption and bribery must be seen as a crucial part of maintaining the socialist system and people's democratic dictatorship. We must strengthen our sense of responsibility and urgency, and strive to do our work more conscientiously. The fight against corruption and bribery is a key task in the party and state's overall anti-corruption efforts and a vital component of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles. We must resolutely continue this struggle for the long term.

Regarding the procuratorate's work this winter and next spring, Liu Fuzhi outlined four key tasks:

1. **Prompt Handling of Self-Surrender and Confession Cases During the "Two Highs" Announcement Period**: Procuratorates at all levels should assign experienced and legally knowledgeable personnel to handle these cases efficiently and lawfully.

2. **Strengthening Investigations**: Procuratorates at all levels should promptly investigate and prosecute those who refuse to surrender or confess. For major criminal leads, especially those who did not surrender during the announcement period, thorough investigations must be conducted, and strict legal penalties must be enforced. We will continue to adhere to the policy of severe punishment for economic crimes such as corruption and bribery. Those found guilty of serious offenses will be severely punished. We will also adhere to the policy of combining punishment with leniency, encouraging criminals to surrender and reform. After the announcement period, those who surrender and confess will not receive the same leniency as during the period, but they will still be treated leniently according to the relevant provisions of the criminal law.

3. **Implementing a Hierarchical Responsibility System for Major Corruption and Bribery Cases**: Central-level major cases and those involving provincial and ministerial-level officials will be primarily handled by the Supreme People's Procuratorate; cases involving bureau-level officials will be primarily handled by provincial procuratorates; and cases involving county and department-level officials will be primarily handled by municipal procuratorates. Additionally, a strict reporting system for major corruption and bribery cases will be established, allowing higher-level procuratorates to timely grasp the situation of major cases handled by lower-level procuratorates and promptly address any issues.

4. **Continuing to Mobilize the Masses and Conduct Reporting Work**: Efforts will be made to thoroughly investigate and respond to reporting leads, severely punish cases of retaliation against reporters, and protect reporters.

　　反贪污贿赂决不手软
　　今冬明春检察机关抓紧四项工作
    新华社北京10月25日电　最高人民检察院检察长刘复之说，从检察机关处理的大量举报材料和立案侦破的大批案件看，贪污、贿赂犯罪确实是很严重的。这种腐败现象，对我们的党组织和国家机关的健康肌体危害极大，对四化建设，对坚持四项基本原则和改革开放的破坏极大。我们检察机关对此要作充分的估计，并做好长期作战的思想准备和组织准备。检察机关办案，一定要坚持以事实为根据，以法律为准绳和公民在法律面前一律平等的原则。对于一切嫌疑线索，都要一查到底，凡是确有犯罪事实的，不管是什么人，都要坚决依法处理，决不手软。
    刘复之说，要把反贪污、贿赂犯罪斗争提到维护社会主义制度，维护人民民主专政的高度来认识，加强责任心和紧迫感，更加自觉地努力做好工作。反贪污、贿赂犯罪是党和国家惩治腐败总任务中的一项重要任务，是坚持四项基本原则的一项重要内容，我们要坚定不移地把严厉打击贪污、贿赂犯罪的斗争长期进行下去。
    在谈到今冬明春各级检察机关反贪污、贿赂斗争工作时，刘复之说，1、抓紧“两高”《通告》期间自首、坦白案件的查证处理工作。要求各级检察院选派政策水平较高、精通法律的业务骨干充实办案力量，力争依法从快处理。2、加强侦查工作，及时立案查处拒不自首、坦白的犯罪分子。要求各级检察院对已经掌握的重大犯罪线索，特别是在《通告》期间拒不投案自首、坦白交代的犯罪分子，及时立案侦查，坚决一查到底，依法从严惩处。我们将继续坚持严厉惩治贪污、贿赂等经济犯罪的方针，对那些严重贪污、贿赂等犯罪分子，坚决依法从严惩处。我们坚持“惩办与宽大相结合”的政策，无论何时，我们都希望犯罪分子走投案自首、悔过自新的道路。在《通告》期满后投案自首、坦白的，不再适用《通告》的从宽幅度，但我们仍将依照刑法的有关规定，予以从宽处理。3、实行侦查贪污、贿赂大、要案件的分级负责制度。对于中央机关的大案、要案和涉及省部级以上干部的案件，由最高人民检察院为主查办；司局级干部的案件，由省、自治区、直辖市人民检察院为主查办；县处级干部的案件，由地、州、市人民检察院为主查办。同时建立严格的贪污、贿赂大、要案件的请示报告制度，使上级检察院能够及时掌握下级检察院办理大、要案的情况，及时解决问题。4、继续发动群众，开展举报工作。下大力量做好举报线索的初查、信息反馈工作，严肃查处打击报复举报人案件，保护举报人。
