Egyptian Foreign Minister Requests U.S. to Clarify Baker's Proposal
U.S. Confirms Israel's Conditional Acceptance of Baker's Proposal

CAIRO, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) — After two rounds of talks between PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Oct. 22 and 23, mediation efforts to facilitate direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis have become more active.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid called U.S. Secretary of State James Baker on Oct. 24 to report on the situation regarding breaking the deadlock and promoting Palestinian-Israeli dialogue. He also requested the U.S. to further clarify its position on Baker's five-point proposal. Meguid briefed the U.S. ambassador to Egypt on the talks between Arafat and Mubarak.

U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross, who is visiting Egypt, announced after the talks that the "door for direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue remains open, and mediation is still ongoing." He said that Arafat's recent visit to Cairo confirmed that the PLO has "not ruled out" Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.

Meanwhile, the PLO officially confirmed that Arafat has received Baker's five-point proposal and has replied to Baker regarding the situation in the occupied territories. PLO leaders are "seriously studying" Baker's five-point proposal.

An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that Foreign Minister Moshe Arens had formally replied to Baker regarding the five-point proposal. The spokesman refused to discuss the content of the letter. Israeli radio reported that Arens "in principle" accepted the five-point proposal but demanded changes to two points: requiring the U.S. to guarantee that the Palestinian delegation does not include PLO members; and limiting the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue to the issue of elections in the occupied territories. The U.S. State Department confirmed that Israel has "conditionally" accepted the five-point proposal.

    本报开罗10月25日电　记者林皎明报道：巴解组织主席阿拉法特10月22日和23日与穆巴拉克总统两轮会谈后，有关举行巴以直接对话的斡旋活动再次活跃。
    埃及外长马吉德24日打电话给美国国务卿贝克，通报有关打破僵局促成巴以对话的情况，要求美国进一步澄清贝克5点建议的立场。马吉德外长向美国驻埃大使介绍了阿拉法特主席与穆巴拉克总统会谈情况。
    正在埃及访问的美国特使惠斯奈在会谈后对外界宣布，巴以直接对话的“门仍然敞开着，斡旋还在进行”。他说，阿拉法特最近在开罗的访问证实，巴解组织对巴以对话“没有把话说死”。
    与此同时，巴解组织正式消息证实，阿拉法特主席已收到贝克5点建议，并就被占领土状况复信给贝克本人。巴解组织领导人
  “正在认真研究”贝克5点建议。
    以色列外交部发言人昨天证实阿伦斯外长致信贝克就5点建议给予正式答复。发言人拒绝谈论信件内容。以色列电台透露，阿伦斯在信中“原则接受”5点建议，但要求修改其中两点，即要求美国担保巴勒斯坦代表团中不包括巴解组织成员；以巴对话仅限于被占领土选举问题。美国国务院昨天已证实以色列“有条件地”接受5点建议。
