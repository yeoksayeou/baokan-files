**Outbound Visit Return**

I left Beijing in June of last year and spent over seven months traveling through the Soviet Union, West Germany, Switzerland, France, England, the United States, and Hong Kong, among 13 countries and regions. I focused on visiting over 50 nature reserves and national parks, and I met with officials, scientists, and the public involved in nature conservation. I circled the globe. My overall impression is: the Soviet Union has relatively good conservation; Europe is recovering after destruction; the United States has destroyed half and conserved half.

The Soviet Union has relatively good conservation for two reasons: first, it has vast, sparsely populated lands; second, the government places significant importance on nature conservation.

Europe is an early economic development region. When their economy and science reached a certain level, they realized the need to protect the natural environment and natural heritage. By then, Europe's landscapes were almost entirely artificial. There are hardly any original forests, and it is rare to see large carnivores. Many unique animals and plants have disappeared with the changing environment. They only realized the value of these things after losing them, so now Europe is mobilizing massive human, material, and financial resources to rescue, protect, and restore nature. These efforts and their results can be seen almost everywhere. For example, the forests in West Germany are tall, large, straight, and dense, with high economic value, truly delightful. However, from an ecological perspective, this is not the best forest. It has at least three weaknesses: first, the artificially modified forest has a single species, and compared to natural forests, the plant species are extremely few. Second, because there are few plant species, the food and habitat conditions they can provide for animals are also limited, so the animal species are not rich. The scarcity of animal species, in turn, will also cause plant scarcity. For example, in many European countries, large predators have become extinct, leading to the overgrowth of herbivores, which threatens the existence and development of various plant communities. People have to use hunting to maintain some ecological balance. Third, due to the simple spatial and nutritional structure, the self-regulating ability of such forests is weak, so their resistance to various disasters is poor. Acid rain is a problem for all countries, but why is the Black Forest in West Germany the most severely affected, to the point of posing a destructive threat? I think this has a lot to do with the artificial nature of these forests.

The United States is a latecomer, and just as it was in the midst of rapid development, figures like John Muir and Theodore Roosevelt emerged as pioneers in nature conservation, playing a significant role in propaganda and organization. They established the world's first national parks, preserving many natural wonders that have attracted global attention, and accumulating a set of mature experiences in laws, systems, and management. I visited the United States for four months and indeed enjoyed many of the fruits of nature conservation. However, at the same time, due to the rapid pace of economic development, many natural areas have been destroyed, and many problems remain unresolved.

When visiting a nature reserve on a small European island, I asked what animals live on the island? They replied: "Rabbits, rats, and cats—even the cats are stray." This answer made me quite reflective. In a conservation area in China, there are giant pandas, golden snub-nosed monkeys, and Tibetan antelopes, all of which are among the world's elite animals. I have seen them with my own eyes in the Wolong and Tangjiahe reserves. I have also seen wild elephants, pheasants, and hornbills in Xishuangbanna, red-bellied pheasants, mandarin ducks, and Hainan partridges in Hainan Island. I have traveled to so many conservation areas in China and abroad, and the animals I mentioned above are not only absent in Europe but also not found in the vast territories of the Soviet Union and the United States. This is what I have seen with my own eyes; as for what I have not seen, there is even more. Of course, there are some animals in other countries that China does not have, but they are few in number. Moreover, China has more than ten species of primates, from the lowly sloth to the high-level gibbon, from the northernmost "Zhili monkey" in the world to the Chinese-endemic golden snub-nosed monkey, truly a vast family of primates, which is rare in the world. In Europe, I rarely saw natural forests, but in China's Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, South, and even Central regions, I have seen different types of original forests, especially in Xishuangbanna and Hainan Island, which still retain precious tropical rainforests and monsoon forests.

In comparison, the natural resources of European and American countries are not abundant. Many Western countries have destroyed their natural environments, but this does not mean they do not protect them; on the contrary, because they have been destroyed and lost, they understand the value of conservation even more. Therefore, they have awakened from destruction and are now restoring grasslands and marshes wherever possible; the public voluntarily organizes to protect frogs crossing the road; in parks, they preserve a bit of shrub and weed to attract butterflies and dragonflies. Watching their actions, I always wonder if we can avoid some of the mistakes they made?

    环球绿色考察归来（上）
    唐锡阳
    我于去年6月离开北京，历时7个多月，途经苏联、西德、瑞士、法、英、美和香港等13个国家和地区，重点访问了50多个自然保护区和国家公园，接触了与自然保护有关的官员、科学家和群众，整绕地球一周。总的印象是：苏联保护比较好；欧洲是破坏了再保护；美国是破坏了一半，保护了一半。
    苏联保护比较好，有两个原因：一是地广人稀；再是政府比较重视自然保护。
    欧洲是个早期经济发展的地区，当他们的经济与科学发展到一定水平，觉悟到需要保护自然环境与自然遗产的时候，欧洲的景观已几乎全部人工化了，那里基本上没有原始森林，基本上看不到大型肉食动物，许多特有的动、植物已经随着环境的变迁而消失。失去了才感到珍贵，所以现在欧洲动员了巨大的人力、物力、财力，来挽救、保护和恢复自然。这种努力以及努力的成果，几乎到处可以见到。譬如，西德的森林，长得又高、又大、又直、又密，经济价值也高，真是招人喜爱。但从生态学的观点来看，这不是最好的森林，它至少有三个弱点：第一，人工改造过的森林品种单一，和自然林比较，植物种类极不丰富。第二，因为植物种类少，所能提供动物食物和栖息的条件也少，所以动物的种类也不丰富。动物种类的单一，反过来也会造成植物的单一。譬如说，猛兽在欧洲许多国家已绝迹，造成草食动物的增长过快，就威胁着各种植物群落的存在与发展。人们不得不采用狩猎的办法来维持某种生态平衡。第三，这种森林由于空间结构和营养结构比较简单，自我调节的能力比较弱，所以抵抗各种灾害的能力就差。酸雨的困惑，各国都有，为什么西德的黑森林表现最明显，以至形成毁灭性的威胁呢？我想和这种森林的人工化有很大关系。
    美国是一个后起之秀，正当大兴土木之际，出现了像约翰·谬尔、西奥多·罗斯福这样一大批自然保护的先驱，在宣传和组织上发挥了巨大的作用。他们建立了世界上的第一批国家公园，保护了很多举世瞩目的自然遗迹，在法律、制度、管理等方面积累了一套成熟的经验。我在美国访问了4个月，确实享受到许多自然保护的成果。但是与此同时，由于经济开发的迅猛，也破坏了不少自然，许多问题至今没有解决。
    访问欧洲一个小岛自然保护区的时候，我问这岛上有些什么动物？他们回答：“兔子、老鼠和猫——猫还是从家里跑出去的。”这个回答使我十分感慨。在中国的一个保护区里，就栖息着大熊猫、金丝猴和牛羚这些属于世界佼佼者的动物，我就在卧龙、唐家河等保护区亲眼见过。我还在西双版纳看到过野象、原鸡和犀鸟，在梵净山看到过黔金丝猴、红腹角雉和鸳鸯，在海南岛看到过坡鹿、孔雀雉和海南山鹧鹄。我跑了这么多中国的和外国的自然保护区，我上面提到的几种动物，不要说欧洲没有，地域辽阔的苏联和美国也没有。这是说我亲眼见过的，至于我没见过的，就更多啦。当然也有一些国家有而中国没有的动物，但毕竟为数很少。再说，我国有十多种猿猴，从低级的懒猴到高级的长臂猿，从世界分布最北的“直隶猴子”到中国特产的金丝猴，真是一个庞大的灵长家族，这在世界上是很少见的。在欧洲我很少见到自然林，而在我国的东北、西北、西南、华南、甚至华中地区，我都见过不同类型的原始森林，特别是西双版纳和海南岛，还保留着珍贵的热带雨林和季雨林。
    相比之下，欧美国家自然资源并不丰富。西方许多国家的自然被破坏了，但并不等于他们不保护了；正因为破坏了，没有了，才更懂得珍惜，更懂得保护。所以他们已从破坏中觉醒过来，正在见缝插针地恢复草原，恢复沼泽；群众自发组织起来，保护青蛙过马路；在公园里保留一点灌丛杂草，以招引蝴蝶、蜻蜒。看着他们的这些举动，我总想西方的老路我们能不能少走一点呢？　（待续）
