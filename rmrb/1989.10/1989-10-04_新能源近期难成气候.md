At a recent World Energy Conference held in Montreal, Canada, many experts agreed that in the coming decades, and at least within this century, new energy sources are unlikely to replace conventional energy sources and have a significant impact on the overall energy structure.

New energy sources, also known as non-conventional energy sources, refer to energy sources other than coal, oil, natural gas, hydroelectric power, and nuclear energy. These include biomass energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, and tidal energy. Their common characteristic is that they are renewable, inexhaustible, and can be used indefinitely.

According to experts, the potential of biomass energy is approximately 10 times the current global consumption of all types of energy. It includes wood, plant stems and leaves, and even animal waste. Solar energy is the solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface through the atmosphere, averaging 200 watts per square meter, and can reach up to 1000 watts at its peak. The total solar energy received by the Earth's surface is roughly 3000 times the world's total energy consumption.

The history of using geothermal energy for power generation dates back a long time. Italy, for example, built the world's first geothermal power plant in 1913. By the beginning of 1989, 20 countries had developed 66 geothermal fields, 233 power generating units, with a total installed capacity of 5.136 million kilowatts. An additional 117 units are either in the process of being installed or planned, with a total installed capacity of 2.017 million kilowatts.

The regions with the richest wind energy resources include northern Canada, northwestern Europe, eastern coastal regions of China, Antarctica, western Africa, and South America. Over the past 15 years, the world has installed 100,000 windmills, utilizing wind energy equivalent to 2.5 million kilowatts, of which 1.5 million kilowatts are used for wind power generation, and the rest for mechanical purposes such as water pumping and milling.

The annual energy output from tides is equivalent to 220 billion kilowatt-hours, but only about 20 billion kilowatt-hours are economically viable. Currently, only 6 billion kilowatt-hours are actually utilized. The world's largest tidal power station to date is the Rance River estuary in France, with an installed capacity of 240,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 500 million kilowatt-hours.

The two oil crises of the 1970s sparked a brief period of intense research and development in new energy sources. At that time, Western countries rushed to secure oil supplies while also exploring new energy sources to reduce their dependence on oil. However, by the mid-1980s, as oil supplies stabilized and prices fell, this enthusiasm waned. Additionally, the technical challenges and high costs associated with utilizing new energy sources, coupled with their low economic returns, make it unlikely that new energy sources will play a significant role in the global energy consumption structure in the near future.

    新能源近期难成气候
  　新华社记者　袁荣生
    在最近于加拿大蒙特利尔市举行的世界能源大会上，许多专家一致认为，在未来几十年内，至少在本世纪内，新能源不可能取代常规能源而对整个能源结构产生重要影响。
    新能源，又叫非常规能源，是指煤、石油、天然气、水电、核能这些常规能源以外的能源，其中包括生物能、太阳能、地热、风能和潮汐能等。它们的共同特点是具有再生性，取之不尽，用之不竭。
    据专家们估计，生物能的资源大概是目前世界上所有各种能源消费量的10倍。它包括木材、植物的茎叶乃至动物的粪便。太阳能是透过大气层到达地面的太阳辐射能，平均每平方米折合电能200瓦，最强时可达1000瓦。地球表面接受的全部太阳能约等于全世界能源消费总量的3000倍。
    利用地热发电的历史很早。意大利早在1913年就建成世界上第一座地热发电站。截至1989年年初，全世界已有20个国家开发了66个地热田，233台发电机组，装机容量为513.6万千瓦。正在或计划安装的有117台，装机容量为201.7万千瓦。
    风能资源最丰富的地区有加拿大北部、西北欧、中国东部沿海地区、南极洲、西非和南美。近15年来，全世界已安装10万部风车，利用的风能相当于250万千瓦，其中150万千瓦是风力发电，其余为抽水、磨面等机械用途。
    潮汐每年发出的能量相当于22万亿度电，但是具有经济价值的约为2000亿度。而目前实际利用的只有6亿度。迄今世界最大的潮汐发电站是法国的朗斯河口，装机容量为24万千瓦，每年发电5亿度。
    在70年代爆发的两次石油危机冲击下，新能源的研究和开发，曾红火过一阵。当时西方世界各国一方面抢购石油，另一方面纷纷从新能源中寻找出路，以求摆脱对石油的过分依赖。但是，进入80年代中期以后，随着石油供应的稳定和石油价格的下降，这股热劲便日益冷淡下来。另外，新能源的利用在技术上难度较大，成本太高，经济效益低。因此，新能源要在世界能源消费结构中占据重要位置还为时尚早。
