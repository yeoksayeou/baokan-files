Title: Why Agricultural Resource Prices Keep Breaking Limits

In recent years, to protect farmers' interests and promote agricultural investment, the state has repeatedly implemented maximum price controls on agricultural production materials. However, these controls have often been broken, with prices rising despite the limits.

The reasons for the failure of maximum price controls include:

1. **Supply and Demand Imbalance**: The total demand for agricultural resources exceeds the total supply, causing product prices to rise far above their actual value. This drives prices up and breaks through the maximum price controls.

2. **Increased Costs**: The rise in raw material prices and operational costs makes it difficult for production enterprises and management departments to survive if they adhere to the original price limits. This inevitably leads to prices breaking through the maximum price controls.

3. **Regional Interests**: The authority to set maximum prices is decentralized among local governments. Each local government, to protect its own interests, wants the maximum price of scarce goods in its region to be close to or higher than that of neighboring regions to prevent the loss of economic benefits. This mutual competition drives up the prices.

4. **High Input, High Output**: For the same type of commodity, some regions implement maximum price controls locally while allowing self-sourced portions to be sold at higher prices with added markup. This effectively allows self-sourced commodities to break through the maximum price controls. Some departments and units, by increasing the markup on commodities that were originally priced lower, also end up breaking through the maximum price controls.

5. **Lack of Specific Regulations**: After the government sets a maximum price for a commodity, it often fails to establish corresponding detailed regulations. People tend to interpret the "not to be exceeded" price limit as a "can be reached" or even "must be reached" price. This, to some extent, drives up the prices.

### 农资价格为何屡限屡破

    农资价格为何屡限屡破
    近年来，为保护农民利益，促进农业投入，国家对农用生产资料多次实行最高限价，但屡限屡破，愈限愈高。
    最高限价失控的原因：
    一是总需要大于总供给，使产品价格远远高于价值之上，从而拉动了价格上涨，突破了最高限价。
    二是原材料价格上涨和经营费用提高。使得生产企业和经营部门如果不突破原定限价便难以生存，必然出现突破最高限价的趋势。
    三是地方利益摩擦。最高限价的制定权由地方政府分散决策。各地政府为了保护本地区的利益，都希望当地的一些紧俏物资的最高限价接近或高于相邻地区，以防止肥水外流。这样，各地互相攀比，抬高限价，客观上拉动了价格上涨。
    四是高进高出。同一品种的商品有的地方既规定在本地实行最高限价，又规定自采部分可以按进价加经销差率高进高出。这样在实质上是允许自采商品突破最高限价。一些部门和单位把本来“低进”的商品，加大经营差率，最终也突破了最高限价。
    五是政府规定了某一商品的最高限价后，没有制订相应的具体细则，人们往往把“不得突破”的限价当作
  “可以达到”甚至是“必须达到”的价格去理解。因此在一定程度上拉动了价格上涨。
