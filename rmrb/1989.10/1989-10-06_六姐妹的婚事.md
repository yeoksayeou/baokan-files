    The Marriage Affairs of Six Sisters

    Xǔ Jiāwén  Zhāng Jūnyǒng

    Wang Mama has several beautiful daughters. Often, there are people who come to propose marriage, but she has set a "household rule": her daughters will only marry military personnel! As a result, her daughters one by one flew to the military camps, leading to many interesting stories.

    Wang Mama is named Wang Sùyīng, a retired worker from the Yongchang Silk Weaving Factory in Huzhou, Zhejiang. In 1957, while studying at the middle school in Shuangjian Town, Mengcheng County, Anhui, she fell in love with a certain battalion commander, Xu Chāo. Despite her father, who runs a car repair shop, strongly opposing her choice, he could not shake or stop Wang Sùyīng's love for a military man. In the spring of 1959, Wang Sùyīng resolutely went to the military camp to marry Xu Chāo. Decades of military camp life made her deeply understand the responsibility and honor of being a military wife.

    Wang Mama has six daughters. When her daughters started considering marriage, she always told them, "You all grew up in the military camp, so find a military man. The wife of a military man is glorious." Wang Mama also promised her daughters, "If you become military wives, I will be your logistics department head." Starting in 1984, Wang Mama's eldest daughter Háng Juān, second daughter Háng Fēn, third daughter Háng Níng, and fourth daughter Háng Wěi, with the help of their mother and matchmakers, successively married military men. Wang Mama truly kept her word, taking care of the children for her married daughters. Neighbors praised her as the "best mother-in-law for military men."

    Wang Sùyīng not only encouraged and supported her daughters in marrying military men but also educated her daughters to support their husbands' work. In July 1984, the husbands of the eldest, second, and third daughters all went to the front lines in Yunnan. For a while, the three daughters could not eat or sleep well. She completely understood her daughters' feelings. Wang Sùyīng told her daughters, "At this time, they need your understanding, support, and comfort the most." Besides reminding and urging her daughters to write more letters, she also wrote letters to the three sons-in-law herself, sending family photos to the front lines. The three sons-in-law performed exceptionally well on the front lines and all received departmental commendations. Recently, the fourth son-in-law came back for a visit, and in his conversation, he revealed the thought of "it's hard in the military, better to transfer to a civilian job as soon as possible." Wang Sùyīng heard this and seriously told him, "The organization sent you to college and then let you stay to teach, how can you ask to transfer?" She gathered the few sons-in-law together and told them, "You all should compete to see who can stay in the military the longest and do the best!"

    At the beginning of last year, Wang Sùyīng found that her sixth daughter, Xiǎohuá, was in love with a soldier again. She happily said, "You are in love with a military man, Mom supports you a hundred times, just don't neglect your studies and work." This spring festival, the fifth daughter who joined the military, Xiǎozhēn, and the four sons-in-law returned home together for the New Year. Seeing the "stripes" and "beans" on the shoulders of the sons-in-law, Wang Sùyīng half-jokingly told Xiǎozhēn, "Little Five, you might as well find a military man too." The fifth daughter replied even more decisively, "Please rest assured, Mom, I will be like my sisters and only marry a military man!"

    六姐妹的婚事
    许佳文  张军雄
    王妈妈有几个漂亮的女儿，时常有人上门求亲，可她偏偏立下“家规”：女儿非军人不嫁！果真，她的女儿一个个地飞向军营，引出许多有趣的故事来。
    王妈妈叫王素英，是浙江湖州永昌丝织厂的退休工人。一九五七年，她在安徽蒙城县双涧镇中学读书时，与某部中尉参谋许超相爱了。尽管开修车行的父亲怎么也不同意女儿的选择，但都没能动摇和阻止王素英爱军人的心。一九五九年春天，王素英毅然来到部队与许超成婚。几十年的军营生活，使她深深体味到一个军人妻子的责任和荣誉。
    王妈妈有六个女儿，当自己的女儿开始考虑婚姻大事时，她总是向她们讲这样一句话：“你们都是在军营长大的，还是找个军人吧，军人的妻子光荣。”王妈妈还对女儿们许愿：“你们要是成为军人妻子，我就当你们的后勤部长。”一九八四年起，王妈妈的大女儿杭娟、二女儿杭芬、三女儿杭宁、四女儿杭伟，在妈妈和红娘的撮合下，相继与军人结为伉俪。王妈妈果真言而有信，为出嫁的女儿带孩子。邻居夸她是“最佳军人丈母娘”。
    王素英不仅鼓励和支持女儿嫁给军人，而且教育女儿支持丈夫工作。一九八四年七月，老大、老二、老三的爱人一同上了云南前线。一时间，三个女儿吃不好饭，睡不好觉。她完全理解女儿们的心情。王素英对女儿们说：“在这个时候，他们最需要你们的理解、支持和安慰了。”她除了提醒和督促女儿们多写信外，还自己动手一一给三个女婿写信，把全家合影照片寄到前沿阵地。三个女婿在前线表现突出，都受到部队嘉奖。前不久，四女婿回来探亲，言谈中流露出“在部队辛苦，不如早点转业回地方”的念头。王素英听到后语重心长地对他说：“组织上送你上了大学，又让你留校任教，你怎么能要求转业呢？”她把几个女婿召集到一块儿，告诉他们：“你们几个要比，就比谁在部队干得长，干得好！”
    去年初，王素英发现六女儿晓华又同部队的一个小伙子恋爱了，高兴地说：“你和军人恋爱，妈一百个支持，只是别耽误了学习和工作啊。”今年春节，从军的老五晓珍和四个女婿一起回家过年。望着女婿们肩上的“杠杠”、“豆豆”，王素英半认真半开玩笑地对晓珍说：“小五子，你干脆也找个军人吧。”老五回答得更绝：“请妈妈放心，我会像姐姐那样，非军人不嫁！”
