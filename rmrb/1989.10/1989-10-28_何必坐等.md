	Why Wait Idly?

	In front of the gate of Hongqi Road Primary School in Shangqiu City, there are more than 20 motorized tricycles parked without any passengers to hire. In some major traffic routes within the city, one can often see such idle vehicles waiting for passengers. The owners of these vehicles are mostly young farmers who come to the city to run passenger transport services to make money. Since there are now more vehicles than passengers, business is slow. Why do the vehicle owners insist on staying in the city, wasting time and resources?

　　何必坐等
    商丘市红旗路小学校门旁停有20余辆无人来雇的机动三轮车。在市区一些交通要道处也常可看到这种闲等乘客的车辆。这些车辆的主人，多半是进城跑客运挣钱的青年农民。如今既然车多客少，生意清淡，车主人何苦老呆在城里耗费时日？
