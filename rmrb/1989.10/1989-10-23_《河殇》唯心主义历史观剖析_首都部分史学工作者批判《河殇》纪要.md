Recently, the editorial departments of five journals—*Historical Research*, *Theory of Historical Science*, *Chinese Historical Research*, *Modern Historical Research*, and *World History*—of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences invited several historians to Beijing for a special critique of "Heshang." The participants pointed out that "Heshang," a "television political commentary," is disguised as an "academic cultural film." It claims to provide a comprehensive reflection on the nation's history, civilization, and destiny, and to call for a sense of national crisis. In reality, it propagates reactionary political views. This is how "Heshang" deceives and misleads people, and it is also the point of pride for its directors. Therefore, to eliminate the harmful social influence of "Heshang," in addition to continuing to expose and criticize it politically, it is necessary to strip it of its academic theoretical disguise and fully expose its pseudoscientific nature. Based on this understanding, the scholars present analyzed "Heshang" from the perspectives of its theoretical sources, historical views, methodologies, and academic style.

1. The Theoretical Sources of "Heshang"

A supporter of "Heshang" once said, "If we must give 'Heshang' a genre name, I think it should be called an 'academic cultural film.' Why is it called an academic cultural film? Because in terms of its overall nature, it is academic. Although it is not a theoretical work, it has a theoretical model, academic insights, and a rational, speculative character." What "theoretical model" and "academic insights" does "Heshang" possess? The chief scriptwriter, Su Xiaokang, listed thirteen. Among them are: Marx's views on the Asiatic mode of production, Hegel's views on natural geography as the basis of history, Toynbee's views on the internal mechanisms of civilization, H.G. Wells' discussion of Chinese history in *The Outline of History*, Francis Bacon's discussion of China's four great inventions, Huang Renyu's argument that ancient China lacked typical private ownership, Plekhanov's views on the inevitability of the commodity economy stage, Jin Guangtao's "super-stable structure" theory, and so on. After this, he made a summary: "Here, there are Marxist classics, the cultural essence of the West that is the source of Marxism, the thoughts of contemporary Western scholars and overseas Chinese studies scholars, and the research results of contemporary Chinese scholars. Whether it is the orthodox teachings of the masters or new theories from new scholars, we consider them all as one view, blending them together to forge the era's strong voice we want to shout." This statement can be seen as the guiding ideology of the directors of "Heshang," and their stated ideology is extremely erroneous.

Firstly, the statement "whether it is the orthodox teachings of the masters or new theories from new scholars, we consider them all as one view, blending them together" appears to be both fair and impartial. In reality, it denies the guiding role of Marxism and reduces "Marxist classics" to just one view, or even does not acknowledge them as such. Throughout "Heshang," it is clear that the directors, in six episodes, discuss historical development and the transformation of civilizations but do not mention a series of major scientific principles of Marxism, such as the mutual relationship between productive forces and production relations, and the economic base and superstructure. Even more absurdly, they dismiss the basic principles that human society progresses from a classless primitive society to a class society, and that class societies have different socio-economic forms. Even when they occasionally mention the views of Marxist classic writers in the film, they either distort or mock them. For example, they arbitrarily distort Marx and Engels' "famous view on the Asiatic mode of production" to mean it is only related to water. Again, they mock Marx, saying that the "capitalist death knell" he had already predicted has not yet sounded; they mock Lenin for not being able to answer Plekhanov's "challenge." From this, it is clear that the direction of "Heshang" is obvious: they do not rely on Marxism, nor do they propagate Marxism, but mainly propagate various non-Marxist Western ideological theories.

Let's look at how "Heshang" treats the ideological theories of Western scholars and other foreign scholars. "Heshang" quotes many views of Western scholars, such as Hegel, Toynbee, Wells, Bacon, and Plekhanov. According to common sense, to use a certain ideology, one must first have a correct understanding of it and then discuss its correct application. However, the directors of "Heshang" did not do this. For example, in the commentary of the first episode, "Dream Seeking," there is a passage: "The more difficult the environment, the stronger the positive forces that stimulate the growth of civilization. This is a famous view in Western historiography." This view refers to Toynbee's "challenge and response" theory. However, Toynbee's original intention was not that the more difficult the environment, the easier it is to respond to challenges. Because an extremely harsh environment exceeds human adaptability at that time, it not only makes it impossible for humans to respond to challenges but may also crush humans. Therefore, Toynbee believed that civilization is produced in an environment that is neither too good nor too bad. Especially in the ancient world, due to people's weak ability to transform nature, the ocean was still a difficult environment to conquer. This strong challenge environment is not a place where humans can successfully respond to challenges, and it is not enough to create an advanced "blue civilization." However, the directors of "Heshang" arbitrarily reinterpret Toynbee's views and forcefully associate the rise of Sumerian civilization, and even Greek civilization, with the ocean, which has no close connection with "continuous maritime life," to deny the "yellow civilization" created by the "yellow-skinned race" on the Yellow River and Yellow Earth.

Again, "Heshang" attributes the idea of "whether a socialist country with an underdeveloped economy can skip the stage of commodity economy development and succeed" to Plekhanov, saying it is a big question mark he raised. In fact, Plekhanov only believed before the October Revolution that the Russian proletariat accounted for a very small proportion of the total population and did not have the prerequisites for a socialist revolution, so he opposed the October Revolution. However, he never considered or had the opportunity to consider the problem of commodity economy development in socialist countries, because he died in May 1918. "Heshang" does this not only out of ignorance but more importantly to belittle Lenin and mock Lenin's inability to answer Plekhanov's challenge. However, historical facts are exactly the opposite. It was Lenin who acutely proposed how to use the commodity economy to build socialism in a relatively underdeveloped capitalist Russia. In other words, this big question mark was raised by Lenin.

Again, "Heshang's" "geographical environment determinism," which holds that the Yellow River determines the history and destiny of the Chinese nation, is basically based on the content of the chapter "The Geographical Basis of History" in Hegel's *Philosophy of History*. From a Eurocentric perspective, Hegel talked about the differences in geographical environments and their decisive roles, claiming that China has never had a close relationship with the sea and has not shared the progressive civilization brought by the ocean, thus cultivating a closed and backward mentality. This view, which does not conform to historical facts, is not even agreed upon by some Western scholars. The German scholar Frank once pointed out that Hegel's arrogant and contemptuous attitude towards Chinese history and civilization is a typical manifestation of European colonial expansionism in the spiritual life in the 19th century. However, the directors of "Heshang" ignore the essence of Hegel's philosophy, that is, the profound dialectical thoughts on the historical process, and instead focus on this dreg of Hegel's thoughts as one of the theoretical foundations of "Heshang."

Moreover, "Heshang's" outdated views on the rise and fall of civilizations and the lack of vitality of "yellow civilization" are directly derived from Toynbee's *A Study of History*. Toynbee takes the cultural forms called "civilizations" as a whole as the unit of historical research, claiming that there have been 21 (later increased to 26) "civilizations" in the world, most of which have already died, some are decaying, and only Western Christian civilization is the "only surviving, not yet obviously disintegrated civilization," maintaining "creative vitality." Regardless of whether Toynbee's elaborate historical philosophy system is so subjective and arbitrary, and now has little influence in the West, here we only discuss Toynbee's erroneous views on Chinese civilization. Indeed, in *A Study of History*, he classified ancient Chinese civilization as one of the "dead" civilizations. However, he later abandoned this view. In his 1974 book *A View of the Twentieth Century*, he no longer regarded Chinese civilization as a closed civilization but believed that in the long river of history, the Chinese nation has cultivated a praiseworthy "world spirit." He even predicted that due to China's excellent historical heritage, in the inevitable process of human unification in the future, China will play a leading role. However, "Heshang" still stubbornly defends Toynbee's old views that he has long abandoned. If Toynbee knew, he would definitely protest to the directors of "Heshang."

These fragmented theoretical views from Western thought are apparently not enough to express the theme of "Heshang." Therefore, the directors brought out the so-called "super-stable structure" theory, supposedly created by their consultant, the "famous historian" Jin Guangtao, as the main theoretical pillar. However, this is not an original creation but was borrowed from Western scholars. By comparing the discussions in "Heshang" about "this mysterious super-stable structure" with some views of the Italian scholar Umberto Melotti in *Marx and the Third World*, it can be found that the two are not only ideologically consistent but also surprisingly similar in textual expression.

Here, it should be pointed out that we are not simply rejecting and denying Western ideological theories. We should absorb all the reasonable elements in them and the true essence of Western culture. The history of the birth and development of Marxism has repeatedly proven this. However, like "Heshang," it is absolutely wrong to indiscriminately "consider them all as one view and blend them together."

2. The Historical Views and Methodologies of "Heshang"

The participants believe that "Heshang" does not have a complete and systematic historical view. The historical concepts it reflects are very complex and are a mixture of idealist historical views and vulgar materialist historical views. Summarized, there are roughly the following aspects:

Regarding the basis of historical development, "Heshang" advocates a fatalistic geographical environment determinism. That is, the so-called "geographical environment has formed an isolation mechanism for the Chinese culture centered on the Yellow River," forging an inward-looking, stability-seeking, and closed cultural type, thus determining that this culture must decline; and the so-called maritime civilization that flourished in the Mediterranean from the beginning has the characteristics of exploration, initiative, and expansion, thus determining that it will achieve superiority in reality and the future. This fatalistic geographical environment determinism is completely contrary to the basic principles of Marxism and does not conform to historical facts. The rise and fall of different civilizations in the world cannot be explained by whether they are near the ocean or deep in the interior. For example, the southern, central, and northern parts of ancient Greek mainland, with numerous city-states, did not have a developed maritime industry, with Sparta being a typical example. However, it created the world-renowned Greek civilization, and during the long period between it and "modern Western industrial civilization," the maritime industry was not very developed, or it was also unrelated to the sea. As for the colonial expansion and commercial activities of some Western European countries, they had deep economic and social reasons and were also due to the long-term accumulation of scientific knowledge and corresponding material guarantees by humans, not because they were merely near the ocean. The entire capitalist system's occurrence, development, and transformation are the result of the mutual interaction of the economy, politics, and culture of all humanity and are the product of a certain stage of historical development. There has never been a "blue civilization" determined by geographical environment in history.

Regarding the form of historical development, "Heshang" advocates the metaphysical "super-stable structure" historical cyclical theory, claiming that there is a "mysterious super-stable structure" that dominates everything in the history and reality of Chinese society, and that the "decaying social mechanism" is still powerless to "break through the historical cycle that repeats itself." In fact, the concept of "super-stable structure" itself is not mysterious. It was first mentioned as a non-primary concept in the "Introduction" of Ashby's book *An Introduction to Cybernetics*. It was originally used to describe the characteristics of a "homeostat" that simulates complex structures that can automatically maintain stability in the process of "brain design."

The directors of "Heshang" passively copy this hypothesis, which is still awaiting verification in the process of simulating the human brain and intelligent machines, as if it has been confirmed as scientific truth; they treat this concept, which can only be applied to specific and special research fields, as a general rule; they indiscriminately extend this knowledge from the natural sciences and technology to the fields of social history and real life.

Whether it is appropriate to introduce the concept of "super-stable structure" into the field of social history is worth studying. Because the premise of "super-stable structure" is a self-stabilizing structure, but whether society has this structure still needs scientific verification. This is because social activities are composed of the activities of many people with different intentions, and the necessity of history is often manifested as chance. History has similarities, but it will not repeat itself. In this sense, society cannot be a self-stabilizing mechanism, and thus there cannot be a "super-stable structure." However, the directors of "Heshang" believe in this "super-stable structure" theory and use it to advocate historical cyclical theory. This historical view makes them ignore the great changes that have occurred in Chinese society since modern times, and even since the founding of the nation, as if China can only change by developing capitalism, and can break out of the "vicious circle" of the social "super-stable structure."

Regarding the stages of historical development, "Heshang" insists on a mechanical materialist view that includes vulgar productive force theory. The directors, although incompatible with Marxist historical theory, sometimes also use Marxist slogans to achieve their political purposes, such as quoting the debate between Plekhanov and Lenin.

"Heshang" emphasizes that Plekhanov "insisted on Marx's view that history cannot skip its necessary development stages and did not advocate seizing power too early." This was actually opposing Lenin's launch of the October Revolution at that time. Plekhanov's erroneous analysis of the Russian social situation has long been proven by historical practice. He was wrong because he was bound by the words of Marxism and could not combine the universal principles of Marxism with the reality of Russia; he could not, like Lenin, creatively apply and develop Marxism, scientifically analyze the reality of Russia, see that although Russia was a moderately developed capitalist country, precisely because of this, the various contradictions within Russia were particularly sharp, and the favorable situation caused by World War I made Russia a weak link in the imperialist chain, possessing the objective conditions for a socialist revolution. At the same time, the subjective conditions of the Russian revolution (such as the proletariat and its new-type revolutionary party, the alliance between workers and peasants) to a large extent made up for the lack of objective conditions.

The victory of the October Revolution eloquently proved that Lenin was a creative Marxist. While Plekhanov, who was once an outstanding Marxist, was only a metaphysical dogmatist on the issue of the October Revolution, or as Lenin said, a "laggard of the times." However, the directors of "Heshang" used Plekhanov's rigid understanding of Marxism to advocate vulgar productive force theory and mechanical materialism in the stages of historical development.

Regarding the driving force of historical development, "Heshang" advocates the theory of external forces. "Heshang" completely denies that the Chinese nation and its civilization possess the internal driving force to advance history, believing that under the challenge of "Western industrial civilization," the ancient Chinese civilization has irreversibly declined and collapsed, and can no longer produce a cultural renewal mechanism. It can only, like the Yellow River flowing into the sea, let the gentle rain of "blue civilization" moisten the dry and hardened yellow land. Such a lack of or loss of basic self-confidence in the "yellow civilization" of China, and in the Chinese nation and culture, is a typical reflection of an irrational trend in contemporary society. This trend generally manifests as a frenzied desire to enjoy the fruits of human civilization without being willing to make arduous efforts for social civilization, not considering what to contribute to society, but only subjectively demanding from society, and once not satisfied, blaming others and admiring foreigners.

3. The Academic Style of "Heshang"

The participants unanimously pointed out that the theory, views, and methods of any work are related to the author's academic style and are an external manifestation of this or that academic style. "Heshang" reflects a frantic, shallow, and empty academic style. It is prominently manifested in the following aspects:

Firstly, posing as the spokesperson for the youth and the enlightenment of the nation, "Heshang" arbitrarily "questions" history and rudely criticizes reality, as if only the directors of "Heshang" are the most wise and clear-headed people today. This is undoubtedly a natural outpouring of emotional frenzy and shallow knowledge, a concrete manifestation of the lack of correct historical views. Every generation has the right to study history, explain history, and gain insights from the understanding of history, but they never have the right to interrogate history or whip history, because people have always been judged by history, not judging history.

The so-called crisis consciousness of "Heshang," or its "cultural philosophy consciousness" as a national "enlightenment," is openly accusing the existence of Chinese civilization of being "precisely the last struggle of the entire ancient world," and the Chinese nation has become a "nation that can no longer afford to lose psychologically," "this may be the heavy and shallow aspect of the yellow civilization!" They indiscriminately clamor that China's way out is to go towards the blue civilization, "China's hope lies in the world." These fallacies show that the frantic and ignorant academic style of the directors of "Heshang" has reached an astonishing level.

Secondly, denying predecessors, despising contemporaries, ignoring Marx and Lenin, and believing only in themselves. "Heshang," in order to construct its "elite thought," dared to brazenly treat historical facts, revolutionary movements, and scientific theories, thus fully displaying the arbitrariness of their "subjectivity." They mock Confucius, Zheng He, Qi Jiguang, and also mock Lin Zexu, Wei Yuan, and Chen Tianhua. More ridiculously, they also mock Marx and Lenin. As for the mockery of Mao Zedong, there is even more. Their arrogant and frivolous attitude towards national heroes, patriotic martyrs, and revolutionary leaders has reached an intolerable level.

Thirdly, arbitrarily selecting materials, arbitrarily commenting, showing off knowledge, and being empty and showy. "Heshang" appears to be erudite, quoting extensively, from nature to society, from ancient mythology to contemporary history, from China to foreign countries, covering economics, politics, nationality, military, science, technology, culture, and related historical figures. On the surface, it is truly grand and magnificent, and with surprising language, not lacking in "philosophy," truly achieving a "sensational" effect. But if one examines it carefully, it is not difficult to find that "Heshang's" arbitrary selection of historical materials and arbitrary and rude historical comments expose the directors' shallow ignorance and reflect their desire to attract attention and create a sensation.

　　《河殇》唯心主义历史观剖析
　　——首都部分史学工作者批判《河殇》纪要
    最近，中国社会科学院《历史研究》、《史学理论》、《中国史研究》、《近代史研究》和《世界历史》等五家杂志编辑部，在北京邀请部分史学工作者对《河殇》进行了专题批判。与会者指出，《河殇》这部“电视政论片”是披着“学术文化片”的外衣，通过所谓“对民族历史、文明、命运的全面思考”，“呼唤全民族忧患意识”，来宣扬他们反动的政治主张的。这是《河殇》得以欺骗、蛊惑人心的地方，也是《河殇》的编导者们最为得意之处。因此，要消除《河殇》恶劣的社会影响，除了必须从政治上继续对《河殇》进行深入的揭露和批判外，还必须剥下它的学术理论外衣，彻底暴露其伪科学的本质。鉴于这种认识，与会学者从《河殇》的理论来源、历史观、方法论和学风等方面作了初步的剖析。
            一、《河殇》的思想理论来源
      《河殇》的一位支持者曾说，如果硬是给《河殇》一个类型定名，我倒觉得它应该叫“学术文化片”。“为什么说它是学术文化片？因为就其整体的性质来说是学术性的，虽然它不是理论著作，但却有它的理论的模式、有它的学术见解、更具有理性的思辨的特征。”《河殇》具有什么“理论模式”和
  “学术见解”呢？总撰稿人苏晓康列举了十三种。其中有：马克思关于亚细亚生产方式的论点，黑格尔关于自然地理是历史的基础的观点，汤因比关于文明自身机制的观点，乔·韦尔斯在《世界史纲》中关于中国历史的论述，弗朗西斯·培根关于中国四大发明的论述，黄仁宇关于中国古代没有典型的私有制的论证，普列汉诺夫关于商品经济阶段不可超越的思想，金观涛的“超稳定结构说”等。在此之后，他作了一段概括：“这里面有马克思主义的经典，有作为马克思主义来源的西方文化精髓，有当代西方著名学者和海外中国研究学者的思想，有当代中国学者研究成果，无论是大师正宗，还是新人新论，我们都视为一家之言，融汇杂糅在一起，熔铸成我们所要呼喊的一个时代强音”。这段话可以视为《河殇》编导者们立论的指导思想，而他所阐述的指导思想恰恰是极其错误的。
      首先，所谓“无论大师正宗，还是新人新论，我们都视为一家之言，融汇杂糅在一起”。这在表面上看来似乎既平等，又公允，实际上却是否定马克思主义的指导作用，把“马克思主义的经典”贬为一家之言，甚至连“一家之言”也未予承认。通观《河殇》，可以清楚地看到，编导者们在前后六集中大谈历史发展、文明嬗变，却对马克思主义关于生产力和生产关系、经济基础与上层建筑的相互关系等一系列重大科学原理只字未提。更有甚者，连人类社会由无阶级的原始社会步入阶级社会，阶级社会又有不同的社会经济形态等基本原理都被一笔抹煞。即使在片中偶而提到几处马克思主义经典作家的论述，不是曲解，便是嘲弄。譬如，把马克思和恩格斯“著名的
  ‘亚细亚生产方式’的观点”武断地曲解为仅仅是“同水有关系”。又譬如，嘲笑马克思，说他“早已预言的资本主义丧钟，迟迟没有敲响”；嘲笑列宁没有能够回答普列汉诺夫的“挑战”。由此可见，《河殇》的倾向非常明显，那就是他们依据的不是马克思主义，要传播的也不是马克思主义，而主要是西方各种非马克思主义的思想理论。
    再回过头来看看《河殇》是怎样对待西方学者和其他外国学者的思想理论的。《河殇》引述了许多西方学者的观点，诸如前面提到的黑格尔、汤因比、韦尔斯、培根等，还提到了普列汉诺夫。按照常理，要引用某一种思想，首先对它要有正确的理解，然后才能谈到正确运用。可是《河殇》的编导者们却不是这样做的。譬如，《河殇》解说词第一集《寻梦》里有一段话：“环境越困难，刺激文明生长的积极力量就越强烈，这是西方史学界的一个著名观点。”这个观点指的是汤因比的
  “挑战与应战”说。可是汤因比原意并不是说环境越困难，就越容易引起应战。因为过于恶劣的环境超过当时人类的适应能力，不仅会使人类无法应战，而且可能把人类压垮。因此，汤因比认为，文明产生于一种既不太好、又不太坏的适度环境。尤其是在古代世界，由于人们改造自然能力较弱，海洋还是难于制服的困难环境。这种对于强大的挑战环境不可能成为人类成功应战的地方，还不足以创造出先进的“蔚蓝色文明”。可是《河殇》的编导者们却随心所欲地改铸汤因比的观点，并牵强附会地将与“持续不断的航海生活”并无密切联系的苏美尔文明、乃至希腊文明的兴起都同海洋联系起来，以此来否定
  “黄肤色的民族”在黄水、黄土上创造的“黄色文明”。
      又譬如，《河殇》把原本不属于普列汉诺夫的“经济不发达的社会主义国家，能不能跳越商品经济发展阶段而获得成功”的思想强加到普列汉诺夫头上，说这是他划出的巨大问号。其实，普列汉诺夫只是在十月革命前认为俄国无产阶级占人口总数比重很小，不具备社会主义革命的前提，因而反对十月革命，但他从未考虑也根本没有可能考虑过社会主义国家的商品经济发展问题，因为他于1918年5月便逝世了。《河殇》这样做，不仅是出于无知，更重要是的为了贬低列宁，嘲笑列宁无法回答普列汉诺夫的挑战。然而，历史事实恰恰与此相反，敏锐地提出在资本主义相对不发达的俄国如何利用商品经济建设社会主义的正是列宁。也就是说，这个巨大的问号是列宁划出来的。
    再譬如，《河殇》关于黄河决定中华民族历史和命运的“地理环境决定论”，基本上是沿袭了黑格尔《历史哲学》中有关《历史的地理基础》一章中的内容。黑格尔从欧洲中心论的立场出发，大谈地理环境的差别及其决定性作用，硬说中国自古没有同海发生密切关系，没有分享海洋所赋予的进步文明，从而养成了闭关自守的落后习性。这种不符历史实际的思想观点，连西方一些学者都不赞同。联邦德国学者弗兰克就曾指出，黑格尔对中国历史和文明所采取的傲慢与蔑视的态度，是十九世纪欧洲人的殖民扩张主义在精神生活领域的典型表现。而
  《河殇》的编导者们却对黑格尔哲学的精华，即那恢宏而深刻的有关历史过程的辩证思想视而不见，偏偏看中了黑格尔思想中的这点糟粕，作为《河殇》的理论基石之一。
      还有，《河殇》关于文明兴衰、“黄色文明”没有生命力的陈腐观点，是直接来自汤因比的《历史研究》。汤因比把被称作“文明”的文化形态整体作为历史研究的单位，声称世界上存在过21种“文明”（后又增至26种），其中多数业已死亡，有的正在衰朽，只有西方基督教文明是“唯一仅存的、尚未明显解体的文明”，保持着“创造性活力”。且不说汤因比精心构筑的这个庞大的历史哲学体系是何等主观随意，如今在西方已经没有多大影响，这里单说汤因比对中国文明的错误看法。的确，他在《历史研究》中，是把中国古代文明归入已经死亡的“文明”之列。可是后来他放弃了这个观点。他在1974年发表的《展望二十一世纪》一书中，不再把中国文明视作封闭的文明，而认为在漫长的历史长河中，中华民族已培育出一种值得称赞的
  “世界精神”。他甚至预言，由于中国具有优秀的历史遗产，在未来不可避免的人类统一过程中，中国将发挥主导作用。然而，《河殇》至今仍在拚命维护汤因比早已抛弃的旧观点。倘若汤因比地下有知，一定要向《河殇》的编导者提出抗议的。
    西方思想中这些支离破碎的理论观点，似乎还不足以表达《河殇》的主题。于是，编导者们又搬出据说是其顾问、所谓“著名史学家”金观涛独创的“超稳定结构”理论，作为主要的理论支柱。可是，这也不是什么独创，也是从西方学者那里贩运来的。只要把《河殇》中的关于“这个神秘的超稳定结构”的论述和意大利学者翁贝托·梅洛蒂在《马克思与第三世界》中的一些观点稍加对照，就可以发现，两者不仅在思想上一脉相承，甚至在文字表述上也惊人的相似。
    这里应该指出，对于西方的思想理论，我们并不是简单地一概排斥和否定。对于其中一切合理的成分，对于真正的西方文化精髓，我们是应该吸取的。马克思主义诞生和发展的历史一再证明了这一点。但是，像《河殇》那样不分青红皂白，统统“视为一家之言，融汇杂糅在一起”是绝对错误的。
    二、《河殇》的历史观和方法论
    与会者认为，《河殇》并无完整、系统的历史观，它所反映的历史观念非常庞杂，是唯心史观和庸俗唯物史观的混合物。归纳起来，大致有如下几个方面：
    关于历史发展的基础，《河殇》宣扬了一种宿命的地理环境决定论。即所谓“地理环境对以黄河流域为中心的中华文化形成了一种隔绝机制”，铸就了一种内向的、求稳定的、闭关自守的文化类型，从而注定这种文化必定要衰落的观点；以及所谓在地中海兴盛起来的欧洲海洋文明，从一开始就具有开拓、进取和扩张的特性，从而注定它要在现实和未来中取得优胜地位的观点。
    这种宿命的地理环境决定论，是完全违背马克思主义基本原理的，也同历史事实不相符合。世界上不同文明的兴衰，用地理环境濒临海洋或深处内陆为因是无法解释的。譬如，古代希腊大陆的南部、中部和北部，为数众多的城邦航海业并不发达，斯巴达尤为典型。但是，却创造了举世闻名的希腊文明，而且它与“现代西方工业文明”之间的漫长时间里，航海业亦不甚发达，或者说也是与海无缘。至于西欧一些国家的殖民扩张和商业活动，既有深刻的经济和社会原因，也由于有人类长期积累的科学知识和相应的物质保证，绝不是因为它们仅仅濒临海洋所致。整个资本主义体系的发生、发展和演变，是全人类经济、政治、文化相互作用的结果，是一定历史发展阶段的产物，历史上从来不存在由地理环境决定的永恒的“蓝色文明”。
      关于历史发展的形式，《河殇》宣扬的是形而上学的
  “超稳定结构”的历史循环论，声称中国社会的历史和现实中，存在着“主宰”一切的“神秘的超稳定结构”，至今，“衰朽的社会机制”仍无力“去冲破那周而复始的历史循环”。
    其实，“超稳定结构”这个概念本身并不神秘，它最初是艾什比在其所著《控制论》一书的“导论”中提到的一个非主要概念。它原是在进行“大脑设计”中描述被用来模拟那些结构复杂而又能自动保持稳定的一种“内稳定器”的特性。
  《河殇》编导者辗转相抄，将这种对于人的大脑设计和智能机器模拟过程中一种尚待证明的假设，当作已经得到确认的科学真理；把这种只能适用于具体的特殊的研究领域的概念，当作有广泛意义的规律；把这种属于自然科学和技术领域的知识，毫无限制地推衍到社会历史领域和现实生活中。
    把“超稳定结构”概念引进社会历史领域是否恰当，大有研究的余地。因为“超稳定结构”的前提是自稳性结构，但社会是否有这个结构还需要进行科学论证。这是由于社会活动是由众多具有不同意向的人的活动所构成，历史的必然又常常是以偶然来表现的。历史有相似之处，但不会重复。从这个意义上讲，社会不可能是一个自稳性机制，因而也就不可能存在
  “超稳定结构”。而《河殇》的编导者们却虔信这种“超稳定结构”论，并借此鼓吹历史循环论。这种历史观使得他们无视近代以来、甚至建国以来中国社会发生的巨大变化，似乎中国只有向资本主义发展才是变化，才能冲出社会“超稳定结构”的“怪圈”。
    关于历史发展的阶段，《河殇》坚持一种包括庸俗生产力论在内的机械唯物主义论点。编导者们尽管对马克思主义历史理论格格不入，但是为了达到自己的政治目的，有时却也打出马克思主义的旗号。如援引普列汉诺夫与列宁的争论就是一个例子。
      《河殇》强调，普列汉诺夫“坚持马克思关于历史不能跳越其必要发展阶段的思想，不主张过早夺取政权。”这实际上在当时是反对列宁发动十月革命。普列汉诺夫对俄国社会形势的错误分析早已为历史的实践所证明。他之所以错误，是因为他拘泥于马克思主义的字句，不能把马克思主义的普遍原理与俄国的实际结合起来；更不能像列宁那样创造性地运用和发展马克思主义，科学分析俄国的实际，看到俄国虽然是一个中等发达的资本主义国家，但是正因为如此，俄国国内各种矛盾才特别尖锐，再加上第一次世界大战造成的有利形势，使俄国成为帝国主义链条中的一个薄弱环节，具备了社会主义革命的客观条件。同时，俄国革命的主观条件（如无产阶级及其新型革命政党，工农联盟）也在很大程度上弥补了客观条件的不足。
      十月革命的胜利，雄辩地证明了列宁是一个富于创造性的马克思主义者。而曾经是杰出马克思主义者的普列汉诺夫，在十月革命问题上不过是一个形而上学的本本主义者，或者如列宁所说的一个“时代落伍者”。而《河殇》的编导者们却借助普列汉诺夫对马克思主义的僵化认识，在历史发展阶段上宣扬了庸俗的生产力论和机械唯物论。
    关于历史发展的动力，《河殇》宣扬的是外力推动论。
  《河殇》根本否认中华民族及其文明具备推动历史前进的内在动力，认为在“西方工业文明”的挑战下，古老的中国文明已经无可挽回地衰落和崩溃了，再也无法产生一种文化的更新机制，只有像黄河汇入大海那样，让“蔚蓝色文明”的和风细雨滋润干涸、板结的黄土地。对中国“黄色文明”，并对中华民族和文化如此缺乏乃至丧失起码自信心的心态，是当前社会上一种非理性思潮的典型反映。这种思潮一般表现为，对社会文明不愿付出艰苦努力，却要急于享受人类文明成果的狂躁情绪，从不考虑向社会贡献些什么，而是一味地凭主观需要向社会索取，一旦不能得到满足，就怨天尤人，崇洋媚外。
    三、《河殇》的学风
    与会者一致指出：任何著作的理论、观点和方法都与作者的学风有关，都是这种或那种学风的外在表现。《河殇》所反映的是一种狂躁、浅薄、华而不实的学风。它突出地表现在这样几个方面：
      （一）以青年的代言人和民族的启蒙者自居，恣意地“诘问”历史，蛮横地指斥现实，好像唯有《河殇》的编导者们是当今大智大睿和最清醒的人。这无疑是一种情绪狂躁和知识浅薄的自然流露，是缺乏正确历史观指导的具体表现。每一代人都有权利去研究历史、说明历史，并从对于历史的认识中取得教益，但他们永远无权去拷问历史、鞭笞历史，因为从来只有人们受到历史的审判，而不是人们去审判历史。
      《河殇》的所谓忧患意识，或者说它作为民族“启蒙者”的“文化哲学意识”，就是公然指责中国文明的存在“恰恰是整个古老世界的最后挣扎”，中华民族已经成了“一个在心理上再也输不起的民族”，“这或许正是那黄色文明的沉重之处和浅薄之处”！他们不加分析地鼓噪中国的出路是走向蔚蓝色的文明，“中国的希望在于世界”。这些谬论说明，《河殇》编导者们狂傲无知、信口开河的学风，已经到了何等惊人的程度。
      （二）否定前贤，鄙薄今人，无视马列，唯我独尊。
  《河殇》为了构造其“精英思想”，竟胆大妄为，放肆地对待历史事实、革命运动和科学理论，从而把他们的“主体”随意性发挥到了淋漓尽致的地步。他们嘲笑孔子、郑和、戚继光，也嘲笑林则徐、魏源、陈天华。更有甚者，他们还嘲笑马克思、列宁。至于对毛泽东的嘲笑，那就更多了。他们对待民族英雄、爱国志士和革命领袖的这种狂妄、轻浮态度，也是到了令人不能容忍的程度。
      （三）随意取材，妄加评说，炫耀知识，华而不实。
  《河殇》貌似学识渊博，旁征博引，从自然说到社会，从上古神话说到当代历史，从中国说到外国，举凡经济、政治、民族、军事、科学、技术、文化等，以及与此有关的一些历史人物，多有涉及。表面看来，真是洋洋洒洒，气势恢宏，加之语出惊人，不乏“哲理”，果真收到了一时的“轰动”效应。但若稍加推敲，就不难发现，《河殇》对史实材料的随意撷取和对历史评论的武断蛮横，既暴露了编导者们的浅薄无知，又反映了编导者们的哗众取宠。
