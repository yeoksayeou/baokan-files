Nixon Arrives in Beijing for a Visit
Qian Qichen Meets and Hosts a Welcome Banquet

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th - Correspondent Ding Gang reports: At the invitation of the Chinese government, the 76-year-old former U.S. President Richard Nixon began his sixth visit to China today. In the evening, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with Nixon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and held a welcome banquet for him.

	Foreign Minister Qian, in his toast, said, "Seventeen years ago, Mr. Nixon, with your foresight as a distinguished statesman, visited China. Together with Chinese leaders, you opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations, which had been closed for more than twenty years, and created a new situation of mutual benefit and cooperation between the two countries. At this critical moment when Sino-U.S. relations face difficulties, your sixth visit to China once again demonstrates your political foresight and courage."

	Foreign Minister Qian said, "This year, when President Bush visited China in February, Chairman Deng Xiaoping proposed the initiative to develop Sino-U.S. relations with the spirit of increasing trust and reducing troubles, fully demonstrating our importance and sincerity in developing Sino-U.S. relations. The current difficulties in Sino-U.S. relations are not what we want to see, nor are they caused by us. I hope the U.S. government can weigh the pros and cons, adopt a forward-looking attitude, and bring Sino-U.S. relations back to the track of normal development as soon as possible."

	Mr. Nixon expressed his thanks for Foreign Minister Qian's welcome. He said, "I am a friend of China. Although I no longer hold public office, I still care about the development of U.S.-China relations." He said, "U.S.-China relations are important to both sides, and U.S.-China economic cooperation benefits both sides. Nixon also expressed his confidence that U.S.-China relations will be restored and developed.

　　尼克松抵京访问
    钱其琛会见并设宴欢迎
    本报北京10月28日讯　记者丁刚报道：应中国政府的邀请，76岁的美国前总统理查德·尼克松今天开始了他的第六次中国之行。晚上，钱其琛外长在钓鱼台国宾馆会见了尼克松，并为他举行了欢迎宴会。
    钱外长在祝酒时说，17年前，尼克松先生以杰出政治家的远见卓识，来华访问，与中国领导人一起打开了封闭二十余年的中美关系大门，开创了两国互利合作的新局面。当前，在中美关系面临困难的关键时刻，尼克松先生第六次访华，再次体现了你的政治上的远见和勇气。
    钱外长说，今年2月布什总统访华时，邓小平主席提出了以增加信任、减少麻烦的精神进一步发展中美关系的倡议，充分表明了我们对发展中美关系的重视和诚意。中美关系目前出现的困难，不是我们所愿意看到的，也不是我们所造成的。他希望美国政府能够权衡利害，采取向前看的态度，使中美关系早日重新走上正常发展的轨道。
    尼克松先生对钱外长的欢迎表示感谢。他说，我是中国的朋友，尽管我已经不担任公职，但我仍然关心美中关系的发展。他说，美中关系对双方都是重要的，美中经济合作对双方都有好处。尼克松还表示，他对美中关系将得到恢复和发展是有信心的。
