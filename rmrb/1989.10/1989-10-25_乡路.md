Title: Paths in the Countryside

The paths in the water town twist and turn like a green snake. No one has ever measured them; often, you start out thinking it's three miles, but after walking for half a day, it's still three miles.

The smoke from the cooking fires in the melon patches is just ahead, but when you push aside the dew-covered grass, you find a small river lying at your feet—an unmanned ferry with a boat lying idle.

You are both the driver and the traffic policeman.

The path, usually baked hard by the sun with ridges like the backs of carp, becomes sticky and slippery in the rain. It's tricky for newcomers, who often end up covered in mud and water. Even if you're used to it, you have to dance a bit like in a traditional Chinese opera, with both soft and hard movements. You might even lose your shoe soles!

The dogs at the bridgehead bark wildly. The bridge is just a couple of bamboo poles tied with grass ropes, and there's no railing, making it a commonplace acrobatic performance. As you cross, the bridge creaks and sways, and so does your heart. You dare not look at your reflection in the water.

Walking barefoot on the dikes is like a poem with a unique flavor. Roll up your pants, carry your shoes and socks, and take a tentative step. The ice that hasn't been melted by the sun pricks your soles. The cold creeps up your skin, turning your feet red, then black from the mud. There's no turning back now. Stretch out your toes, tensing every joint, and you'll feel connected to the earth. Your eyes can't wander, and your heart can't linger on the city's paved roads. In a blink, you might lose your footing… Keep moving forward to find your balance. Gradually, your feet warm up, your knees stop aching, and sweat trickles down your back. Your once-tight heart unfurls in the sunlight…

Leaning against the silver birch tree, even the thin layer of frost on the tiles seems gentle and lovely.

Back then, there were no bicycles, unless you carried two spinning wheels on your shoulders. Of course, there were no Santanas or "Shanghai" cars. For thousands of years, people walked these paths. On rainy days, they wore wooden clogs or straw shoes, or tied bundles of rice straw to their feet. Grandpa's grandpa dressed like this, walking without slipping on the grass, the first lesson in life?

Oh, the paths winding through the green fields, like an eight-diagram maze, make you search your heart, dispelling boredom and forgetting the heavy burdens. Don't sigh; sighing won't help. So, from the depths of the path, a rough mountain song drifts out.

The path not only teaches you how to walk but also stirs up longing. Finally, the quiet and secluded water town echoes with the roar of bulldozers and road rollers…

As you approach your hometown, you hesitate, because the memories of standing still and losing your way have confused you!

　　乡路
　　陈益
    水乡的路，青蛇似地蜿蜒。没有人丈量过，常常起脚是三里，走了半天仍然是三里。
    那炊烟袅袅的瓜棚就在眼前了，拨开沾满露珠的草丝，却见一条小河躺在了脚边——野渡无人舟自横。
    你就是你的驾驶员和交通警。
    平日晒得隆起无数鲫鱼脊背，坚硬如铁的路，在雨天却是粘而泞滑。它欺生，没打过几次交道的，免不了让你滚一身泥水回去。即使走惯了，扭那么一路秧歌，也得有软硬功夫。说不定还会粘掉鞋底呢！
    欺生的，还有在桥头乱吠的草狗。那桥，只是两支毛竹缠几道草绳，且没有护栏，便成了最普及的杂技。吱吱嘎嘎中，脚也晃荡，心也晃荡，竟不敢看水中的倒影。
    赤脚走在田塍上，是一首有味的诗。挽起裤管，提着鞋袜，走出试探的一步。尚未被太阳融化的冰凌扎得脚底生疼。寒气顺着皮肤往上窜，脚冻得通红，继而又被污泥涂黑。此刻已不容回首。使劲伸展脚趾，让每一个关节都绷紧，便与大地有了肌肤之亲。眼睛顾不及乜斜，心也顾不及留恋城里的大马路，一个忽闪，就会失去立足之处……朝前走，才会有平衡。渐渐地，脚板发热了，膝弯里不再冰冷酸痛，腰背间竟渗出细汗。那颗蜷曲着的心，在阳光下舒展开来……
    靠在银杏树身上时，连瓦楞上薄薄的残霜，都变得柔美可爱。
    那时候没有自行车，除非你把两只滴溜溜旋转的轮子扛在肩膀上。当然也没有桑塔纳和“上海”牌。路，千百年来就用脚走。雨天穿木屐、草鞋，或者在脚底缚一束稻草，爷爷的爷爷就是这般装束，走路不须问，走草边不打滑，该是最初的启蒙？
    哦，布在绿野间曲曲折折盘绕回复的乡路，恍若八卦阵，它让你费心寻觅，于五彩纷呈的景色中消除沉闷，忘却荷担负重的劳累。别叹息，叹息也没有用。于是路的深处悠然飘出粗犷的山歌。
    路，不仅仅教给人怎么走，也诱发了企盼。终于，静谧而又偏僻的水乡响起了推土机、压路机的轰鸣……
    近乡情更怯，是因为蹀躞不前的记忆迷了路啊！
