In a small town in Bengal, India, there is a temple, a sacred place. Suddenly, cholera breaks out, causing widespread panic. A local doctor discovers that the holy water from the temple is the source of the disease, leading to a controversy. Some young people in the town support the doctor's scientific findings, and newspapers in Calcutta all published the doctor's discovery. Thus...

This is the plot summary of the Indian film "The Enemy of the People," which participated in this year's Cannes Film Festival. It is the latest work by the renowned Indian director Satyajit Ray, who had taken a five-year hiatus from filmmaking due to illness.

During his university days, Ray had seen Ibsen's famous work "An Enemy of the People." The play, written in 1882, tells the story of Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a doctor in a Norwegian spa town who discovers that the mineral baths are severely polluted by industrial waste. He issues a warning, which angers the vested interests. Incited by them, he becomes isolated, and a man who insists on principles ultimately becomes the enemy of the people.

Ray said, "Environmental pollution, just like a hundred years ago, is still a problem, and it is an even more serious problem today." Ray adapted the spirit and narrative structure of Ibsen's play, transplanting it to contemporary India, and filmed it in a classical style with a plain and unadorned approach. The film caused a sensation when it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Ray thought the original play's ending was too pessimistic, so in the adaptation, he changed the ending to the doctor ultimately winning with the support of some young people. Why emphasize young people? Obviously, Ray places his hopes in the young. He said, "If there is any difference between today and a hundred years ago, it is that today's young people are much more aware than those of a hundred years ago. Today's doctors should receive more support, and this support should come from young people." In his view, young people are educated, knowledgeable, less conservative, and daring to innovate, representing the future hope.

This 100-minute film was originally scheduled to be shot in 45 days, but it was halted for 26 days. Many scenes were successful on the first take, saving both time and money. Throughout the shooting process, the doctor was always by Ray's side, and an ambulance was parked near the set in case of emergencies. After completing the film, Ray's health actually improved. Ray cannot be separated from filmmaking; film is his spiritual anchor.

The author had the opportunity to meet Ray during the Indian International Film Festival in early 1980. He was approachable and had none of the airs of a famous director. This multitalented old director, born in 1921, established his position in the world of cinema with the "Apu Trilogy," of which the first part, "Pather Panchali" (1955), won the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival—the Palme d'Or.

Ray is an outstanding artist who maintains close ties with the masses. He said, "When I make films, I always think of the Indian audience." "Sometimes I feel that some of our young directors pay too much attention to art and too little to the audience." In the "vast ocean" of Indian commercial films, Ray stands out, always focusing his camera lens on the miserable plight of the lower classes, vividly depicting different aspects of Indian life with a realistic approach, and having a profound impact.

At 68 years old, Ray is still active in the Indian film industry. He has directed 26 feature films. His films have won numerous international awards but have never won an Oscar. He is not bothered by this. He said, "I am very happy with what I have achieved." Hollywood has repeatedly invited him to make films in the United States, and the British Broadcasting Corporation has also extended an invitation, but he has declined them all. He said, "I lose my creative inspiration when I go abroad," "My roots are here, and I am only interested in Indian themes."

### 享誉世界影坛的印度导演——萨蒂亚吉特·雷伊

　　享誉世界影坛的印度导演——
　　萨蒂亚吉特·雷伊
　　言兼
    在印度孟加拉的一座小城里，有一神庙，是个圣洁之地。突然，霍乱流行，人心惶惶。当地一位名医发现，庙里的圣水是致病之源，由此引起了一场风波。城里的一些年轻人支持医生的科学判断，加尔各答各报均刊登了医生的发现。于是……
    这是参加今年法国戛纳电影节的印度影片《公敌》的故事梗概，是享誉世界影坛的印度著名导演萨蒂亚吉特·雷伊因病息影五年后的又一力作。
    在大学读书时，雷伊看过易卜生的名作《人民公敌》。该剧写于1882年，讲一位名叫汤姆士·斯托克曼医生的故事。斯托克曼是挪威某疗养胜地的医生，发现该地的矿泉浴受工业废料污染严重，遂提出警告，从而触犯了既得利益阶层。在他们的煽动下，他陷于孤立，一个坚持原则的人最后却成了人民的公敌。
    雷伊说：“环境污染一如百年前，至今仍是个问题，而且是个严重得多的问题。”雷伊取易卜生剧作的精神和叙事结构，将该剧移植到当代印度，以古典派手法、平实无华的风格拍成电影。该片在戛纳电影节上放映后引起轰动。雷伊认为原剧结尾悲观色彩太浓，在改编成电影时，他将结尾改为医生在一些年轻人的支持下最后取得胜利。为什么强调年轻人？显然，雷伊把希望寄托在年轻人身上。他说：“我感到，如果今天与百年前有什么不同的话，那就是今天的年轻人比百年前的觉悟高多了。今天的医生应得到更多的支持，而这种支持应来自年轻人。”在他看来，年轻人有文化，有知识，较少保守，勇于创新，是未来的希望。
    这部100分钟的影片，原定拍摄45天，结果26天停机，很多镜头一次成功，既节省了经费，又缩短了时间。在整个摄制过程中，医生始终守在雷伊身旁，急救车就停放在摄影棚附近，以防万一。影片拍完，雷伊的身体反而好了起来。雷伊离不开电影，电影是他的精神寄托。
    笔者有幸在1980年初印度国际电影节期间会见了雷伊。他平易近人，丝毫没有大导演的架子。这位出生于1921年的多才多艺的老导演以《阿普》三部曲奠定了他在世界影坛的地位，其中第一部《道路之歌》（1955）曾荣获戛纳电影节大奖——金棕榈奖。
    雷伊是一位杰出的艺术家，与广大群众保持着密切联系。他说：“我拍片时总想着印度观众。”“有时我感到，我们的一两个年轻导演过多地考虑艺术，而很少考虑观众。”在印度商业片的“汪洋大海”中，雷伊独树一帜，始终坚持把摄影镜头对准下层人民的悲惨遭遇，以现实主义手法出色地展示了印度人民生活的不同层面，起到了振聋发聩的作用。
    现已68岁高龄的雷伊仍活跃在印度影坛上。他已拍摄26部故事片。他的影片在国际上曾数十次获奖，但从未得过奥斯卡奖。对此，他毫不介意。他说：“我对已取得的成就非常高兴。”好莱坞曾多次请他去美国拍片，英国广播公司也提出邀请，但他都一一谢绝。他说：“我一到国外就缺乏创作灵感，”“我的根在这里，我只对印度主题有兴趣。”（附图片）
