Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th.

It has been learned from relevant sources here that at the 32nd General Assembly of the World Federation of United Nations Associations held in Moscow, Bi Jilong, President of the Chinese United Nations Association, was re-elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Federation. At the meeting of the new Executive Committee, he was unanimously elected as Chairman.

This is the first time since the Chinese United Nations Association resumed activities and rejoined the World Federation in 1985 that a Chinese representative has taken the post of Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Federation.

The United Nations Association is a civilian organization dedicated to supporting the United Nations. More than 200 representatives from over 60 countries or regions attended the Moscow conference held from October 9th to 14th. The delegates exchanged views on how the United Nations can play a more active role in maintaining world peace and promoting common development in the new situation, and issued a statement calling on the peoples and governments of all countries to strengthen cooperation to solve major problems facing the world today, such as poverty, environmental degradation, and regional conflicts, which threaten global security and the future of mankind.

After the conference, the Chinese delegation visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet United Nations Association. Both sides held a symposium on issues of common concern.
