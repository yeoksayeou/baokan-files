	We are still very young, and in terms of experience, business, and strength, we cannot compare to the Hong Kong branches of the Bank of China and the China Resources (Holdings) Company. However, in recent years, the China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group has taken it upon itself to stabilize and prosper Hong Kong's economy and support the economic construction of the mainland, striving to do something practical for the country.” In late August, Xu Zhaolong, the general manager of the Beijing-based China Resources (Holdings) Company, told the reporter this.

	The China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group was established soon after its parent company was founded. Recently, the reporter visited Hong Kong and found that it has indeed done a lot of practical work in participating in the development of Hong Kong's economy and raising funds to support the energy construction of the mainland. It has already established a certain position in the minds of Hong Kong people and has become a rising star among state-owned enterprises.

	Far-sighted Measures

	In late September, good news came from Hong Kong: the second underwater tunnel connecting Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula, following the completion of the MTR project in August, officially opened to traffic. The construction of this second tunnel—the Eastern Harbour Crossing—is a major event in Hong Kong's public utilities development history, which the public has long been looking forward to. It consists of a double-deck road tunnel and a double-deck MTR tunnel. After completion, it will greatly alleviate the tense cross-harbor traffic situation between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. However, when it was planned in 1984, the Sino-British Joint Declaration had not yet been issued. At that time, the market was not very prosperous, and people's minds were not very stable. Should they invest or not? The Beijing headquarters and the chairman of the board of directors of China Resources (Holdings), Rong Yiren, made the decision: not to ask the state for a single cent, but to have the China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group raise funds and invest 10%. They considered the economic benefits after completion, but at that time, they paid more attention to the stabilizing effect on Hong Kong's economy. Now the investment ratio has increased to 24.5%, totaling 340 million Hong Kong dollars. They also built 340 million square feet of buildings on two plots of land at both ends of the tunnel, cooperating with well-known real estate companies such as Cheung Kong (Holdings) and Kumagai Gumi to build residential and commercial properties, turning barren land into gold. The buildings are provided to Hong Kong society after completion, which can expand influence and increase value. People say: this is a far-sighted measure.

	The acquisition of 12.5% of the shares of Cathay Pacific Airways caused a great sensation at the time. This is a first-class, influential airline in the world, belonging to the British Jardine Matheson Group, which has opened more than 40 routes around the world. Considering the future of Hong Kong, after the Sino-British agreement was signed, Jardine wanted to cooperate with a strong state-owned enterprise. Under the leadership of the headquarters, the China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group secretly negotiated with Jardine for five days and successfully signed the agreement. On the fifth day, when the stock exchange suspended trading of Cathay Pacific, attracting people's attention, they had already signed the contract. The speed of the transaction, the high efficiency, and the strict confidentiality did not fail to amaze Hong Kong and even international figures.

	Working with Hong Kong's top figures, participating in influential investment projects, handling Hong Kong affairs in Hong Kong, and operating entirely according to local economic laws and management methods have greatly increased the China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group's reputation.

	Seeking Victory in Stability

	Hong Kong's economy is prosperous but also particularly sensitive. A responsible person from the China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group said: operating real estate and stocks as well as foreign exchange trading involves great risks, but since they are doing business in Hong Kong society, "if you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger?" They firmly grasp the principle of seeking victory in stability, avoiding speculation and gambling everything on one throw. Whether it is a calm day or a stormy time, they assess the situation and choose favorable opportunities to strive for the best economic results. An executive director of the group, who is a well-known real estate operator in Hong Kong, told me that China Resources' real estate investments have "short-term" and "long-term" strategies.

	"Short-term" is to choose the best time to enter and exit, making profits in between. "Long-term" is to buy and then start a business, taking root and blooming. Hong Kong's re-export trade is thriving, and warehouses are in demand. They bought a 30,000-square-meter warehouse in Kowloon, Yulun, which is somewhat famous in the industry, and also bought the operating rights, making it a subsidiary of the group. Vegetables, meat, eggs, fruits from the mainland, fresh goods from Southeast Asia, and beef from New Zealand can all be stored here. There are not more than 20 cold storage warehouses in Hong Kong. This warehouse is of the upper-middle type and can also store dry goods. It has more than 1,000 customers, with large customers accounting for 30% to 40%. The warehouse is managed and operated entirely in the Hong Kong way. It is expected that the investment can be recovered in five years, making a profit of one warehouse.

	They also raised funds to buy 20 ocean-going cargo ships, setting up shipping companies one by one to lease the ships and expand the business scope.

	Due to the correct guiding ideology and proper management, they have made profits year after year, with a profit of nearly 300 million Hong Kong dollars in 1988.

	The Emotion of Electricity

	Electricity, this weak link in the national economy. The most prosperous regions of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou in the Yangtze River Delta are severely short of electricity. The China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group took the lead in organizing the Hong Kong New Macro Electric Power Investment Company to cooperate with Jiangsu, Wuxi, and New Force Energy Development Company to jointly build the Jiangyin Lihang Power Plant. The first phase of the project is to build two 350,000-kilowatt generating units, which started construction last year and is expected to be completed in 1991. The two generating units can provide 4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to the grid, which can basically meet the electricity needs of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou in the next few years. According to local calculations, 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity can increase industrial output value by 7 yuan, which is a considerable number! In the spring, when the reporter visited Wuxi, Mayor Wang Hongmin talked about this matter with great joy: "China Resources has done us a great favor!"

	The industrial city of Baotou in Inner Mongolia is rich in coal and other mineral resources but is also short of electricity. The China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group raised funds to cooperate with the Huameng Power Company to expand the Baotou Power Plant, building three 100,000-kilowatt generating units. Last year, one unit was put into operation, and the remaining two units are expected to be completed in the next two years. For the local area, this is like a timely rain after a long drought.

	They also cooperated with the National Energy Conservation Company and Zhengzhou City to renovate the Zhengzhou Thermal Power Plant, which was built in the 1950s, and expanded two 200,000-kilowatt heating and power generating units. After they are put into operation, they can provide centralized heating, eliminating a large number of small chimneys, greatly alleviating the power shortage in Zhengzhou, and improving the urban environment.

	Building power plants requires large investments, long cycles, and slow returns. The China Resources (Holdings) Hong Kong Group has a vast field of activity overseas. Why did they choose this hard bone to gnaw on? An insider said: there is both a sense of responsibility and a sense of emotion here. Since the country is in such urgent need of electricity, as a state-owned enterprise in Hong Kong, they believe they should do their best and make a contribution. Moreover, the vice-chairman and general manager of this group, Rong Zhijian, studied electricity and worked in electricity (Note: Li Peng once said: "Little Rong has an affection for electricity." Rong Zhijian once worked with Li Peng in the Beijing power system). To select sites for building power plants in the mainland for him, he once, together with colleagues from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, traveled from Northeast China all the way to Tianjin, Hebei, Shanghai, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang. For him, this is indeed a familiar path.

　　香港中资的后起之秀
　　——访中信香港集团
　　本报记者　计泓赓
      “我们的香港集团还很年轻，论资历、业务、实力，均比不上香港中银集团、华润集团。不过，这些年来，中信香港机构以稳定和繁荣香港经济、支援内地经济建设为己任，尽力为国家做点实事。”8月底，北京中信集团总经理徐昭隆对记者这样说。
    中信香港机构是在它的母体诞生不久成立的。不久前记者在香港访问，发现它在参与发展香港经济上，在筹资支援内地能源建设上，确乎办了不少实事。它在香港人士的心目中已有了一定地位，成为中资机构的后起之秀。
    有远见之举
    9月下旬，香港传来喜讯：连接香港岛和九龙半岛的第二条海底隧道，继8月地铁工程通车后，公路也正式通车了。修建这第二条隧道——东区隧道，是香港公众盼望已久、香港公用事业发展史上的一件大事。它由双程汽车隧道和双程地铁隧道组成，建成后将大大缓解港岛与九龙间过海交通的紧张状况。可是在1984年酝酿修建时，中英尚未发表联合声明。当时市场不太景气，人心也不太稳定。参不参与投资？北京总部、中信董事长荣毅仁作了决断：不向国家要一分钱，由中信香港机构出面筹资，参股10％。他们投资固然考虑到建成后的经济效益，但当时更着眼于对香港经济的稳定作用。现在投资比重已增至24.5％，合3.4亿港元。他们还在隧道两头两块地皮上，兴建340万平方英尺的屋宇，与长江实业、熊谷组等著名地产公司合作盖住宅和商场，变荒芜之地为黄金之地。盖成向香港社会提供，既可扩大影响，又可身价百倍。人们说：这是有远见之举。
    收购国泰航空公司12.5％的股份，当时引起了很大轰动。这是国际第一流的、有影响的航空公司，属英国太古集团，在世界开辟了40多条航线。考虑香港的前景，在中英签约以后，太古很想与一家强有力的中资机构合作。中信香港集团在总部领导的运筹下，5天就与太古秘密谈判成功。第5天，当交易所国泰停止挂牌，正引起人们注意时，他们已在签约了。办事之快，效率之高，保密之严，不由得引起香港乃至国际人士的惊叹。
    与香港第一流人士合作，参与有影响的投资项目，港事港办，完全按当地的经济规律和经营方式运转，使中信香港集团的知名度大为提高。
    稳中求胜
    香港经济繁荣，又特别敏感。中信香港集团一位负责人说：经营房地产和股票以及外汇买卖，风险很大，但既然在香港社会经商，“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”。他们牢牢把握稳中求胜原则，不搞投机和孤注一掷。不管是风平浪静之日，还是惊涛骇浪之时，他们审时度势，选择有利时机，力求最佳经济效果。集团一位执行董事是香港有名的地产经营者，他告诉我，中信房地产投资，有“短线”，也有“长线”。
  “短线”是择佳而进，择佳而出，从中赚取利润。“长线”是买下后办企业，生根开花。香港的转口贸易多，货仓吃香。他们买下了在行业中稍有名气的3万平方米的九龙裕林货仓，还买下了经营权，成为集团的下属公司。来自内地的蔬菜、肉蛋、水果，来自东南亚的鲜货和新西兰的牛肉，均可在这里冷藏。香港冷藏仓库总共不超过20个。这个仓库属中上型的，还可存放干货，客户超过1000个，其中大客户占30％至40％。仓库完全按照香港方式经营管理。预计5年即可收回投资，白赚一个货仓。
    他们还融资买下20条远洋货船，逐个设立船务公司出租船只，扩大业务范围。
    由于指导思想对头和经营得法，他们连年获得盈利，1988年利润近3亿港元。
    电的感情
    电，这国民经济的薄弱环节。长江三角洲最富庶的苏、锡、常地区缺电厉害。中信香港集团牵头组织香港新宏电力投资有限公司，与江苏、无锡及新力能源开发公司合资兴办江阴利港电厂。第一期工程为兴建两台35万千瓦的发电机组，去年已经动工，预计1991年建成。两台发电机组能为电网提供40亿千瓦小时电，可基本满足近几年苏、锡、常用电的需要。按当地算法，一千瓦小时电能增工业产值7元，计算起来，是个不小的数字！今春记者在无锡采访时，无锡市长王宏民谈起这件事非常高兴：“中信可给我们办了件好事！”
    内蒙古的工业重镇包头，煤和其他矿产资源均很丰富，也是缺电。中信香港集团筹集资金，与华蒙发电公司合作扩建包头发电厂，建设3台10万千瓦发电机组。去年已有一台机组投产，其余两台今明两年可望完成。这对当地来讲，无异久旱逢甘霖。
    他们还和国家节能公司、郑州市合作，改造50年代建成的郑州热电厂，扩建两台20万千瓦供热发电机组。投产后，可集中供热，取消一大批小烟囱，既可大大缓和郑州缺电局面，又可改善城市环境。
    办电，投资大，周期长，回收慢，中信香港集团在境外活动的天地很大，何以竟捡这块硬骨头来啃？知情人曰：这里既有责任感问题，也有感情问题。国家既如此急需电，作为香港一个中资机构，他们认为理应尽心尽力，作点贡献。况且，这个集团的副董事长兼总经理荣智健，当年学的是电，干的是电。（注：李鹏曾说：“小荣对电有感情”。荣智健曾与李鹏在北京电力系统共过事。）为给内地建电厂选址，他曾会同水电部的同志从东北一直转到天津、河北、上海，江浙，这对他来讲，可谓熟门熟路呢。
