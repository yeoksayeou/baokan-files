	Someone calls me an entrepreneur, saying that through my efforts and those of the entire factory, a formerly loss-making enterprise has become the largest drilling machine production specialist factory in Shandong Province. Someone calls me a poet, because I am a member of the provincial writers' association and have published nearly a hundred poems.

	I say, I am just a contemporary of the Republic; it is the Republic that has given me everything.

	When I was young, due to family circumstances, I left my parents and was fostered in a distant place. Thanks to the socialist motherland, I was able to study from elementary school all the way to high school. When I first learned to express my emotions with words, I picked up my pen to sing the praises of socialism. Although those early works were naive and laughable, they expressed the heartfelt sentiments of a young, passionate youth. After entering society, I repaired radios, learned rubber technology, burned bricks, managed a pig farm, and served as the party branch secretary in a village of over 800 households. No matter where I went, I never put down my pen. Although the poems were not perfect, they were a comfort, squeezed from life, carrying the warmth of the motherland.

	In 1981, I was transferred to a loss-making enterprise to serve as the factory director. The factory was in a state of production paralysis, with a scattered workforce and a desolate scene. It was the grand vision and vast tide of the Republic's reform and opening up that inspired me to take on this responsibility. I, along with everyone else, worked on rectifying and reforming the enterprise while exploring the creation of an enterprise culture. In just one year, the enterprise came back to life! The new life made me invigorated, and my desire to create was stronger than ever. On many nights, after the night shift workers had left, I was still deep in thought. The soft moonlight inspired me:

	Borrowing Light
	Not for my own use
	But to offer to the earth...

	The theme of singing the moon allowed me to blend natural philosophy with life, and poetry with factory spirit: if several hundred employees were several hundred "moons," each contributing their light to the motherland and the enterprise, what a scene that would be! At my suggestion, a new enterprise spirit was established throughout the factory: the factory is mine, and I am the factory's.

	Under the support of the enterprise spirit, potential was unleashed. The sound of reading in the night school, the roar of the machine tools, the debate over technological breakthroughs, all accompanied the footsteps of the motherland's progress, forming a great surge in my heart. The poem "Forge" is my depiction of this fiery life:

	Faces like ancient bronze
	Facing the pure green of the furnace
	The heavy bellows are gone
	The blower hums softly
	The air hammer shatters
	The heavy labor of swinging the hammer
	Plays out
	The song of the new era
	People have the passion of fire
	The hammer listens to people's commands
	Processing a joyful life
	Steel takes shape as desired

	Over the course of nine years, our enterprise improved year by year, and my poems became more numerous. Often, people ask me: how does a factory director find the time to create? Often, I can't explain it clearly. I only feel that the footsteps of the motherland's rise are calling, and the inspiring people and events around me are urging me on. I can't help but express myself, and I can't help but sing. Thus, my heart is full of unfinished poems.

### 心中有写不完的诗

专栏：共和国与我国庆抒怀征文

    心中有写不完的诗
    山东省文登市钻床厂　于树淦
    有人叫我企业家，说因为经过我和全厂的努力，一个昔日的亏损企业成了山东省最大的钻床生产专业厂；有人称我诗人，因为我是省作家协会会员，发表了近百首诗作。
    我说，我只是共和国的同龄人；是共和国，给了我一切。
    我幼年时，因为家庭原因，离开父母被寄养异乡；托社会主义祖国的福，我才从小学一直读到中学。当我第一次学会用文字表达自己的情感，便提笔为社会主义讴歌。尽管那些习作稚嫩得可笑，却道出了一个热血少年的全部心声。走上社会，我修理过无线电，学过橡胶制品技术，烧过砖瓦，管理过猪场，在800多户的村里当过党支部书记……无论走到哪里，始终放不下的是那一支笔。一首首小诗虽不够完美，却自慰是从生活中挤出来的乳汁，带着祖国母亲的温馨。
    1981年，我被调到一家亏损企业任厂长。这个厂生产瘫痪，人心涣散，一派萧条景象。是共和国改革开放的宏伟气魄和泱泱大潮，激励我接过这副担子。我和大伙一边治理整顿企业，一边探索着创造企业文化。短短一年，企业竟然复活了！新的生活使我振奋不已，创作的欲望空前强烈。多少个夜晚，夜班工人已经下岗，我仍在深深沉思，柔和的月光唤起我的灵感：
    借光
    不是为了自己用
    而是向大地奉送……
    咏月的主题使我融自然哲理于生活，融诗情于厂情：假如几百名职工是几百颗“月亮”，把各自的光都奉献给祖国和企业，那该是怎样的情形哟！在我的提议下，新的企业精神在全厂树起：工厂是我的，我是工厂的。
    潜力在企业精神的支撑下得以迸发。夜校的读书声，机床的轰鸣声，技术攻关的论争声，伴着祖国前进的脚步声，在我心中汇成一股巨大的热流。《锻工》一诗便是我对火热生活的写照：
    脸色似古铜
    面对炉火纯青
    笨重的风箱不见了
    鼓风机在轻鸣
    空气锤砸碎了
    抡大锤的繁重
    奏出了
    新时代的歌声
    人有火的激情
    锤才听人的命令
    加工欢乐的生活
    钢铁如愿成型
    9年间，我们的企业一年好过一年，我的诗也越来越多。常常有人问我：厂长百事缠身，哪来的精力搞创作？常常我也说不出个子丑寅卯。我只觉得祖国奋起的脚步声在召唤，身边令人感奋的人或事在催迫，不吐不快，不歌不畅，心中因而便有写不完的诗。
