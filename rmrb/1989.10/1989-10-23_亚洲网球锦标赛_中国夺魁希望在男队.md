Today in the afternoon, the first gold medal of the Asian Tennis Championship was decided. South Korean players Lee Jeong-myeong and Lim Suk-ja defeated Japan's Nishiya Akemi and Hanada Eiko with a score of 2-0, winning the women's doubles championship. The Japanese players took the silver medal.

In today's match, the 146th-ranked player in the world, Japan's Nishiya Akemi, lost two consecutive sets to China's young player Li Fang, causing a major upset. The scores for the two sets were 6-4 and 6-0. The defending champion of the women's singles from the last tournament, Wang En-ting of the Chinese Taipei team, also defeated South Korea's veteran player Lim Suk-ja with a score of 2-0, successfully navigating the first hurdle in her title defense. China's hopes for the championship are concentrated in the men's events. Tomorrow, Pan Bing and Zhang Jiuhua will compete with South Korean players for a spot in the men's singles final, while Liu Shuhua/Pan Bing and Xia Jiaping/Zhang Jiuhua will vie with South Korean and Hong Kong players for a place in the men's doubles final.
