Title: At the Factory District Intersection

At the corner of a T-junction in the residential area, there has been a shoe repair stall for years. The owner is a middle-aged woman with short hair. She sits on a canvas stool, with a piece of cloth that has faded beyond recognition covering her knees. She hammers and sews all day, greeting customers, and her business is quite brisk.

She looks very ordinary, always smiling, and her weather-beaten face is etched with deep and shallow wrinkles.

Behind her is the construction office of a factory. To the left of the steps, there are some "one-string-red" flowers blooming brightly in the sunlight; the ivy in the corner is lush and green, stretching its tendrils everywhere, covering the walls and climbing up to the roof.

Around the stall, there are shoe nails, soles, shoe polish, glue, files, and a few discarded inner tubes from bicycles. There is also a simple hand-crank sewing machine to one side and a bamboo chair for customers to sit on. A long wooden sign is stuck in the stall, with crooked but earnestly written words: "Quality guaranteed, ready immediately." From a distance, it looks like a simple folk painting.

She lives in the city, and if something happens or the weather is bad, she doesn't come to set up her stall. The workers in the factory district often miss her. When the shoe stall is open, customers come in a steady stream: some need to go to work, some need to repair rain-soaked shoes, some need to nail on new soles; there are men and women, old and young. Those who need to wear their shoes immediately sit on the chair, waiting for her to fix them before rushing off to work. Those who are not in a hurry just say hello to the female shoemaker and agree on a time to pick up their shoes.

She meticulously repairs every pair of shoes, nailing the soles of men's shoes tightly, and for the high-heeled shoes that young women bring, she nails the soles securely. Girls who buy new leather shoes first come to ask her to nail on new soles...

She and her shoe stall have become an indispensable part of the lives of the residents in this area.

One day, I took a pair of cowhide shoes that I had recently bought to be repaired. Perhaps my feet are too heavy, or the quality is too poor, the sole had almost come off. She took the shoes and looked at them, saying, "This needs to be completely re-sewn. Your feet are heavy, I'll use thicker thread for you and sew it tightly, guaranteeing that it won't come off again."

She then bent down, holding the awl in her right hand to punch holes, and quickly pulling the waxed thread with her left hand, sewing tightly.

I sat on the bamboo chair, watching her serious attitude as she worked the awl and thread, and couldn't help but think of the famous short story "The Most Thorough" by the British writer Galsworthy. She and the old shoemaker in the story are the same, treating their work with the utmost seriousness. Although what she does is a very ordinary small thing, society cannot do without it. As a philosopher once said, the various small parts of life combine to represent the whole life, just as various notes connected in an orderly manner become a melody, and various colors combined in an orderly manner become a painting. Without her and her work, the rich tapestry of life would be missing a deep hue.

The shoes were repaired. The female shoemaker stretched out her hands, which were marked with lines from the waxed thread, and said, "Wear them for a few days and see if they are okay. If not, bring them back, and I won't charge you again."

I put on the shoes and lightly stamped my feet a few times, walked back and forth a few steps, feeling that they were both comfortable and satisfying, so I happily paid and thanked her.

A few years have passed, and this pair of leather shoes is still being worn. They have accompanied me through muddy paths, sandy roads, and asphalt surfaces. The sole threads have never come loose.

I think, if each of us can be as persistent in handling small matters as she is, our cause will flourish and prosper, turning hope into reality...

    厂区路口边
    马平
    在生活区丁字路口的一角，长年累月摆着个修鞋摊。主人是位剪着短发的中年妇女。她坐着个帆布凳子，膝头蒙着块已经不易分辨颜色的苫布，抡锤飞针，终日迎送顾客，生意很是兴隆。
    她长得极为平常，整日笑嘻嘻的，饱经风霜的脸庞爬上了深一道浅一道的皱纹。
    她的身后，是一家工厂的筹建处，台阶的左边种着些“一串红”，在阳光下争妍斗艳；墙角的常青藤长得郁郁葱葱，四处伸着触角，爬满墙壁，爬上了屋顶。
    摊子四周摆满鞋钉、底掌、鞋油、胶水、锉子等一应工具，还有几条自行车的废内胎。一部简陋的手摇缝纫机放在一边，还有张竹椅子，那是让顾客坐的。摊子上插着块长形的木牌，上面歪歪扭扭，却是认真地书着“保证质量，立等可取”的字样，远远看去，像是幅淳朴的民俗画。
    她住在城里，遇上个什么事，碰上个恶劣天气，没有来摆摊，厂区的工人们还常念叨着。鞋摊摆开了，修鞋的人络绎不绝：有的要上线，有的补雨鞋，有的钉鞋掌；有男有女，有老有少；急着穿的便坐在椅子上，等她把鞋子修好，然后赶路上班。不急着穿的，便和女鞋匠打声招呼，约好时间来取。
    她一丝不苟地修补好每一双鞋子，对男人们的鞋，她把线扎得一针连着一针；对女孩子拿来的高跟皮鞋，她把鞋掌钉得牢牢的。姑娘们买的新皮鞋，第一件事便是赶来请她钉上个新鞋掌……
    她和她的鞋摊，已成为这一带居民生活中不可缺少的组成部分。
    有一天，我拿着双刚买不久的牛皮鞋去修补。可能是脚太重，或许是质量太劣，鞋底几乎脱了一半线。她接过鞋看了看，说：“这得全部上过线，你脚太重，我替你上粗一些的线，扎得牢一点，包管今后再不脱线了。”
    说完低下身子，右手拿起锥子扎洞眼，左手飞快地抽紧着蜡线，密密匝匝地缝了起来。
    我坐在竹椅上，看着挥锥舞线的认真态度，不禁想起英国作家高尔斯华绥的著名短篇小说《最认真的》中的那位老鞋匠。她和他都是这样，极其认真地对待自己所做的工作。她所作的虽是很平常的小事，但社会上却少不了它。正如一位哲人所说，生命的各个小节综合起来方能表现整个生命，同各个音符有规律地连贯起来才成为曲子，各种颜色有规律地组合起来才成为一幅画一样。没有她和她的工作，丰富的生活画卷便会少去一抹浓浓的色彩。
    鞋修好了。女鞋匠伸开被蜡线磨出斑痕累累的手说：“穿上几天看看行不行，不行再拿来，不再收钱了。”
    我把鞋子穿好在地上轻轻跺了几下，来回走了几步，感到既合脚，也称心，便愉快地付款，致谢。
    几年过去了，这双皮鞋依旧穿着，它伴我走南串北，泥泞中蹭过，沙石中磨过，柏油路面走过，鞋底线一直未脱。
    我想，如果我们每个人都像她那样执著地对待每一件小事，我们的事业兴旺发达就会从希望变成现实……
