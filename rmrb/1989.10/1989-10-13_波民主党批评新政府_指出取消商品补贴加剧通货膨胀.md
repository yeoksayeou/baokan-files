Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 11th.

The Polish Democratic Party today criticized the new government's economic program, stating that it is "vague" and "needs to be supplemented in many areas."

This is the initial assessment made by the Central Committee of the Polish Democratic Party during a meeting discussing the domestic situation regarding the economic program of the government led by Solidarity. Observers here noted that this is the first critical opinion expressed by the Democratic Party since it broke away from the United Workers' Party in mid-August and formed a coalition government with Solidarity.

The Central Committee of the Democratic Party also believes that the new government, without considering the total market supply, immediately canceled subsidies for goods, "leading to increased inflation and further sharp rises in living costs for residents." It demands that the government "consult with society" before making major decisions.

    波民主党批评新政府
    指出取消商品补贴加剧通货膨胀
    新华社华沙10月11日电　波兰民主党今天对新政府的经济纲领提出批评，认为纲领内容“笼统”，在不少方面“需要充实”。
    这是波兰民主党中央主席团会议今天在讨论国内形势时对以团结工会为首的政府的经济纲领作出的初步评价。据此间观察家们指出，这是民主党从8月中旬背离统一工人党，与团结工会结盟组阁后提出的第一个批评意见。
    民主党中央主席团还认为，新政府在“没有考虑”市场总供给的情况下立即取消对商品的补贴“导致了通货膨胀加剧和居民生活费用进一步猛增”。它要求政府在作出重大决策前“与社会进行商量”。
