Shougang focuses on recruiting frontline workers and intellectuals into the Party. The Party membership continues to grow, becoming the backbone and core force in the enterprise's efforts to build both material and spiritual civilization.

Since the reform and opening up, Shougang has paid great attention to recruiting frontline production backbones and intellectuals into the Party, especially in key production positions, heavy workloads, and tense work environments. This has led to a significant increase in the proportion of Party members among intellectuals and frontline workers. Currently, among workers with a junior college education or higher, Party members account for more than one-third. In all production positions, there are Party members in every shift, and 2,470 production teams have established Party cells.

The Shougang Party Committee has strict requirements for Party members, and their role as vanguards and models has been fully realized. In 1988, out of the 42 workers awarded the title of Beijing Labor Model, 40 were Party members.

    首钢重视吸收一线生产骨干入党
    据新华社北京10月8日电　（记者刘浦泉）首都钢铁公司重视吸收一线工人和知识分子入党。党员队伍不断发展壮大，成为企业两个文明建设的中坚和骨干力量。
    改革开放以来，首钢十分重视在生产关键、任务繁重、工作紧张的岗位吸收一线生产骨干和知识分子入党，从而使知识分子党员和生产一线职工党员比例明显增加。目前，具有中专以上学历的职工中，党员已占三分之一以上；所有的生产岗位，班班有党员，其中2470个生产班组建立了党小组。
    首钢党委对党员严格要求，党员的先锋模范作用得到了发挥。1988年，首钢被评为北京市劳动模范的42人中，党员占40名。
