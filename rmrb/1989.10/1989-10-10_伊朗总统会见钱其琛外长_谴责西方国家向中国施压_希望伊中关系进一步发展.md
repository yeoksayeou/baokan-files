Iranian President Meets with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
Condemns Western Countries' Pressure on China, Hopes for Further Development of Iran-China Relations

Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, October 8 - Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani met with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today in Tehran and held talks on bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern.

President Rafsanjani welcomed Minister Qian's visit and expressed hope for further development of relations between the two countries.

Rafsanjani stated that Iran has developed relations with China after evaluating the situation in Iran and the world. He said that strengthening cooperation between the two countries will have an impact on the Gulf region and other parts of the world.

He noted that Iran and China share similar views on many international issues and hoped that the two countries would play a greater role in the Third World.

Rafsanjani condemned Western countries' pressure on China, stating that it aims to change China's direction. He said, "They actually impose groundless pressure on a large country like China. You can imagine how they would treat small countries."

Minister Qian highly praised Iran's positive stance in resolving the Iran-Iraq conflict. He pointed out that establishing true and lasting peace is of great significance to both Iran and Iraq and the entire Gulf region.

Minister Qian said that although the Iran-Iraq conflict cannot be resolved overnight, the two countries can make progress on relatively easier issues such as troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange to break the deadlock in negotiations.

During the meeting, Minister Qian handed over a letter from Chairman Yang Shangkun to Rafsanjani. Qian also held a second round of talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on bilateral relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, October 8 - Minister Qian once again called on Iran and Iraq to resume peace talks in accordance with the spirit of UN Security Council Resolution 598.

Minister Qian, in his remarks to the press upon concluding his three-day visit to Iran, said that China hopes Iran and Iraq will return to the negotiating table to seek solutions to their disputes. He urged the two countries to consolidate the ceasefire, withdraw their troops to internationally recognized borders, and exchange prisoners of war.

    拉夫桑贾尼总统对钱外长来访表示欢迎，并希望两国关系得到进一步的发展。

    他说，伊中两国对许多国际问题的看法相同，希望两国在第三世界发挥更大的作用。
    拉夫桑贾尼谴责西方国家向中国施加压力是旨在改变中国的方向。他说，“他们居然对像中国这样的大国毫无根据地施加压力，你可以想象他们会怎样对待小国。”
    钱其琛外长高度评价伊朗在解决伊朗—伊拉克冲突当中所采取的积极立场。他指出，建立真正和持久和平对两伊和整个海湾地区具有重大意义。
    钱外长说，两伊冲突虽不可能一朝一夕获得解决，但两国可以在比较容易解决的撤军和交换战俘等问题上取得进展，以打破谈判僵局。
    会见时，钱外长向拉夫桑贾尼递交了杨尚昆主席的一封信件。钱其琛今天还和伊朗外长韦拉亚提就双边关系问题举行了第二轮会谈。
    新华社德黑兰10月8日电  钱其琛外长今天再次呼吁伊朗伊拉克本着联合国安理会598号决议精神，恢复和平谈判。
    钱外长结束了对伊朗3天访问在机场对新闻界发表谈话时说，中国希望伊朗和伊拉克重新回到谈判桌上，寻求解决争议的办法。他呼吁两伊巩固停火，把各自的军队撤到国际承认的边界上并交换战俘。
