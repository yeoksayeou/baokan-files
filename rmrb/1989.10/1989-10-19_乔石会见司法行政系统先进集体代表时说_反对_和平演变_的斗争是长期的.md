Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 18th. — Reporter Xu Yunping reports: Qiao Shi this afternoon, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, met with representatives attending the national conference to commend advanced collectives in the judicial administration system for their efforts in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He extended warm congratulations to the representatives of the 52 units that were awarded the title of advanced collectives.

Qiao Shi said that during the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the spring and summer of this year, the judicial administration system performed well, maintaining a firm stance, clear banner, and clear attitude. He pointed out that the future struggle will be long-term. The international climate will not change much, and the struggle against "peaceful evolution" will also be long-term. The activities of a small number of people domestically who attempt to change the socialist nature will continue to exist. Therefore, the concept of class struggle and the concept of people's democratic dictatorship must be upheld. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, the concept of people's democratic dictatorship must not be shaken or hesitated. The struggle is complex and arduous.

Qiao Shi hopes that the advanced collectives that have won the honorable title will remain humble and make new contributions under new conditions and circumstances.

State Councilor Wang Fang, President of the Supreme People's Court Ren Jianxin, Minister of Justice Cai Cheng, and Minister of State Security Jia Chunwang attended the meeting.

    乔石会见司法行政系统先进集体代表时说
    反对“和平演变”的斗争是长期的
    本报北京10月18日讯　记者徐运平报道：乔石今天下午代表党中央、国务院会见了参加全国司法行政系统制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱先进集体表彰大会的代表，并向荣获先进集体的52个单位的代表表示热烈祝贺。
    乔石说，在今年春夏之交制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，司法行政系统表现是好的，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，态度明朗。他指出，今后的斗争是长期的。国际大气候不会有很大的改变，反对“和平演变”的斗争也是长期的。国内极少数人妄图改变社会主义性质的活动还会继续存在。因此，阶级斗争的观念、人民民主专政的观念必须坚持。正像邓小平同志所说的人民民主专政的观念决不能动摇和犹豫。斗争是复杂和艰巨的。
    乔石希望获得光荣称号的先进集体戒骄戒躁，在新的条件和形势下做出新的贡献。
    国务委员王芳、最高人民法院院长任建新，司法部部长蔡诚、国家安全部部长贾春旺等参加了会见。
