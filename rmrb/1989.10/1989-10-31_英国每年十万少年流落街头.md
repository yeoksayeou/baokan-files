The British newspaper *The Times* recently published a survey report stating that at least 100,000 youths under the age of 17 run away from home each year in the UK, primarily to escape from the harsh family environments of drug abuse, violence, and arguments. After leaving home, these children often end up on the streets, where they are easily lured by criminals and fall into a life of crime. The report suggests that the dramatic increase in divorce rates is a significant social factor contributing to the pain and misfortune experienced by these children. Statistics show that in the UK, one out of every three couples gets divorced.

　　英国每年十万少年流落街头
    英国《泰晤士报》最近发表的一份调查报告说，英国每年至少有10万名17岁以下的青少年离家出走，主要为的是逃避吸毒、暴力和争吵的恶劣家庭环境。这些孩子离家后流落街头，往往受黑社会坏人的勾引，堕入歧途。报告认为，离婚人数剧增给孩子带来莫大痛苦和不幸是重要的社会原因。据统计，英国每3对夫妇中就有1对离婚。
