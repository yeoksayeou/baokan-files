    Cultural Stations in Townships Should Not Be Repurposed
    Recently, while traveling, I discovered that many township cultural stations have been forced to "change their line of work." The buildings of these cultural stations are being used by various township units to store miscellaneous items, causing the cultural stations to become paralyzed.
    Township cultural stations are crucial places for farmers to learn scientific and cultural knowledge, understand the Party's policies and guidelines, obtain information, and work towards prosperity. According to farmers from these townships, these cultural stations, which were once bustling with activity, used to be filled with people seeking knowledge. Every market day, the place would be teeming with farmers. However, this good situation did not last long. The cultural stations were successively rented out to other units or individuals, who used them to store miscellaneous items or set up stalls to do business.
    Farmers now can only sigh in disappointment when they come here. They urgently hope that these township cultural stations can reopen.

    乡镇文化站不应挪作它用
    近来外出，发现不少乡镇的文化站被迫“改行”，文化站的房屋被这些乡镇的某些单位用来堆放杂物，使文化站处于瘫痪状态。
    乡镇文化站是农民学习科学文化知识，了解党的方针、政策，获得信息、治穷致富的重要场所。据这些乡镇的农民讲，这些被迫“改行”的乡镇文化站昔日门庭若市，成天
  “取经求知”者络绎不绝，每逢赶场天，这里更是农民云集的地方。可好景不长，文化站相继被其它单位或个体户租借，用来堆放杂物或者摆开柜台做起了生意。
    农民们每天到此只好望室兴叹，他们迫切希望这些乡镇文化站重新开放。
