Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with foreign ministers from six countries at the United Nations headquarters today.

Qian Qichen met separately with the foreign ministers of Thailand, Iraq, Brunei, Cuba, East Germany, and Sri Lanka.

The foreign ministers of China and Thailand exchanged views on the Cambodian issue. Both sides agreed that efforts should continue to achieve a fair and reasonable political solution through negotiations. The Vietnamese claim of withdrawal lacks effective international supervision, and there are reasons to doubt it. Both sides expressed a willingness to maintain contact, consult regularly, and cooperate closely on the Cambodian issue in the future.

Qian expressed to Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz that the two countries have achieved a ceasefire based on UN Security Council Resolution 598. Both sides now need to rebuild their countries and require a peaceful and stable environment. China hopes that Iraq and Iran will resume talks as soon as possible to achieve lasting peace. To this end, China supports the Secretary-General's efforts to fully implement Resolution 598.

Aziz also expressed hope for a lasting peace with Iran.

Qian Qichen and Brunei's Foreign Minister Bolkiah expressed satisfaction with the development of bilateral relations over the past year and agreed to further strengthen these relations in the future.

    钱其琛会见六国外长
    本报联合国10月2日电  钱其琛外长今天在联合国总部分别会见了泰国、伊拉克、文莱、古巴、民主德国和斯里兰卡六国的外长。
    中泰两国外长就柬埔寨问题交换了意见，双方一致认为，应继续努力通过谈判使柬埔寨问题获得公正、合理的政治解决。越南所说的撤军由于没有有效的国际监督，人们有理由对其表示怀疑。双方表示今后要继续在柬埔寨问题上保持接触，经常磋商，密切合作。
    钱外长对伊拉克外长阿齐兹表示，两伊已经在安理会598号决议的基础上实现停火。现在双方都需要建设自己的国家，都需要和平稳定的环境。中国希望两伊尽早恢复谈判，实现持久的和平。为此，中国支持秘书长为全面执行598号决议所进行的调解。
    阿齐兹也表示希望能够和伊朗一起实现持久的和平。
    钱其琛外长和文莱外交大臣博尔基亚对一年来两国关系的发展均表示满意，并表示今后应进一步加强双边关系。
