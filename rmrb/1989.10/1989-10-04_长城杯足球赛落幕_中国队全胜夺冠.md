China's national football team defeated the Pyongyang team from North Korea 2-1 tonight, securing the championship of the Long City Cup International Football Tournament with a perfect record of three wins. The Soviet Black Sea team defeated China's Olympic team 3-2 to claim the runner-up position.

The Pyongyang team, which had lost two consecutive matches, played aggressively from the start against the undefeated Chinese team. They frequently used fierce tackles to challenge the Chinese team. The Chinese coach started the match by deploying Wu Qunli as the forward, Fu Yubin as the goalkeeper, and replaced the injured right-back Mai Chao with Dong Liqiang. Just 4 minutes into the game, Wu Qunli scored after receiving a header from Liu Hai Guang, giving China the lead. In the 12th minute of the second half, China used a similar tactic to score again, with player number 18, Duan Ju, adding another goal. Although the North Korean team missed a penalty, they managed to score a goal in a quick counterattack, reducing the deficit to 1-2.

China's Olympic team led twice tonight but was equalized both times by the Soviet Black Sea team. Unfortunately, just a few minutes before the end of the match, the Soviet team scored, exposing the defensive weaknesses and lack of experience of the young Chinese players.

China's head coach Gao Fengwen was named the best coach of the tournament. Player number 7, Xie Yuxin, and North Korea's player number 15, Yin Zhe, were named the best athletes, while the Soviet team's goalkeeper, number 1, Gorishko, was named the best goalkeeper.

The Chinese team will depart for Guangzhou tomorrow and will play their final warm-up match against the Soviet team on the 5th. On the 8th, they will travel to Singapore to participate in the final round of the Asian qualifiers for the World Cup.

    长城杯足球赛落幕
    中国队全胜夺冠
    本报北京10月3日讯　记者汪大昭报道：中国足球队今晚以2∶1战胜朝鲜平壤队，获得长城杯国际足球锦标赛冠军，战绩为三战全胜。苏联黑海人队以3∶2赢了中国奥林匹克队，获亚军。
    已经连输两场的朝鲜平壤队在迎战两战两胜的中国队时，自始至终打得很快，不时以凶狠的逼抢给中国队出难题。中国队教练一开场就启用吴群立出任前锋，傅玉斌把守球门，又以董礼强替下右脚受伤的边后卫麦超。比赛刚打到4分多钟，吴群立接柳海光的头球摆渡后，首开纪录。下半时第12分钟，中国队以相同的套路发动攻击，18号段举在同样的位置上再添一分。朝鲜队虽然射飞了一记点球，但在下半时一次快速反击中成功，扳回一分。
    中国奥林匹克队今晚曾两度领先，都被苏联黑海人队追平。尤其可惜的是比赛结束前几分钟被苏联队破门，暴露出防守上的弱点和年轻选手场上经验的不足。
    中国队主教练高丰文被评为本次比赛最佳教练员，7号谢育新和朝鲜平壤队15号尹哲被评为最佳运动员，苏联队1号戈里什科为最佳守门员。
    中国队将于明天动身赴广州，5日与苏联队进行最后一场热身赛，8日赴新加坡参加世界杯外围赛亚洲六强决战。
