The first match saw Liu Xiaoguang playing white and losing, which disappointed many Henan chess fans. They were not surprised by Ma Xiaochun's easy victory in the first game, as the challenger should have the strength to challenge. However, they did not believe that their local chess player would be willing to bow down. The reason is that Liu Xiaoguang had previously won the Tianyuan title by losing the first two games and then winning the next three in his decisive match against Ma Xiaochun.

The general manager of Henan Province Garment Import and Export Group Company, Dong Mingyu, came to the Zhongzhou Hotel early to visit Liu Xiaoguang. This entrepreneur, renowned in Henan's garment industry, said, "There is no such thing as smooth sailing in the world. Failure after effort is the beginning of success."

Unperturbed, Ma Xiaochun remained calm after winning the first game, spending two consecutive nights playing bridge with his companions to pass the time and adjust his nerves. Before the second game, he avoided discussing the match, engaging in casual conversations as broad and vast as his elegant and free-spirited chess style, making it difficult to discern his true thoughts. However, calmness and confidence were evident in his demeanor.

The ability to self-regulate and control before and during a match is the foundation for athletes to perform at their best, a quality that is extremely difficult to cultivate. It is said that Nie Weiping, one of China's top Weiqi players, possesses this ability to the highest degree. However, most athletes lack this quality, not just in Weiqi, but in other sports as well. This quality and ability are often honed through failure or unexpected situations. In a sense, whoever is good at self-regulation holds the initiative.

The biggest headache for the national Weiqi team leader, Hua Yijang, was not the three consecutive matches of commentary and one report he had to deliver, which filled his schedule, but rather the need to consider the feelings of Henan chess fans while vividly and deeply explaining the games. He had to ensure they could understand and accept the outcomes they did not want to see.

　　逐鹿中原
　　——琼联杯第二届中国围棋名人战纪实（二）

    首战，刘小光执白告负，河南棋迷们颇感失望。对马晓春轻松地夺得第一盘胜利，他们并不觉得奇怪，挑战者应该具有挑战者的实力。然而，他们不相信家乡的棋手会甘愿俯首称臣，根据是刘小光曾在天元战与马晓春的决战中，就是先输两盘后连扳三盘勇夺天元桂冠的。
    河南省服装进出口集团公司总经理董明玉一早来到中州宾馆看望小光。这位在河南省服装业赫赫有名的企业家说：“世界上没有一帆风顺的事，经过努力的失败是走向成功的开始。”
    不露声色的马晓春在首盘获胜后，仍旧那样平静，连续两个晚上与同伴打桥牌，消磨时光，调节神经。第二盘比赛前，他闭口不谈比赛，海阔天空的闲聊就如同他那飘逸洒脱的棋风一样令人难以捉摸他的真实想法。然而，镇定和自信依然流露在眉宇之间。
    比赛之前和比赛中自我调节和控制能力是运动员正常发挥技术水平的基础，是一种极难培养的素质。据说我国围棋界最有这种能力的当推聂卫平。但在大多数运动员中是较差的，这不仅仅是围棋，这种素质和能力的培养往往更需要在失败，或意想不到的情况发生时磨练。从某种意义上讲，谁善于自我调节，谁就掌握了主动。
    最令国家围棋队领队华以刚头痛的，不是他连续三盘的挂盘讲解和一次报告会排满了他的日程，而是在他绘声绘色，由浅入深地讲解对局时，又得顾及河南棋迷的心情，尽量使他们能够理解和接受他们不愿看到的结局。
