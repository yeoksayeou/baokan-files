In the past two years, the various levels of party committees and governments in Jilin Province have earnestly implemented the spirit of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Seventh Session of the National People's Congress regarding the promotion of national defense education for all citizens. They have extensively carried out national defense education centered on patriotism, and have initially formed a good social atmosphere of loving the people's army and supporting national defense construction.

To achieve effective results in national defense education, various places in Jilin Province have utilized various educational means and platforms to carry out rich and colorful educational activities. Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has used various schools, theaters, exhibition halls, martyrs' cemeteries, and other venues to expand national defense education to every corner of society, ensuring that radio broadcasts have one segment, newspaper propaganda has one column, television programs have one item, artistic performances have one act, and bulletin board galleries have one section.

Currently, the entire province has 2,432 units paired with the military in "building two civilizations together," helping the military solve problems and do practical things, totaling more than 76,200 items.

Various levels of government have also formulated and improved preferential policies for the families of active-duty soldiers, veterans, and demobilized soldiers. At present, 5,103 military family service centers (stations) have been established in urban areas across the province, and 10,767 organizations have been established in rural areas to serve martyrs and military families. At the same time, the entire province is actively solving various living difficulties for military families and veterans, having settled 2,514 demobilized officers and 23,349 demobilized soldiers. Various places have generally established demobilized soldiers' training institutions, strengthened the retraining of demobilized soldiers' dual-use talents, and fully played their roles in the construction of two civilizations.

　　吉林国防教育成绩斐然
    本报讯　近两年来，吉林省各级党委和政府认真贯彻党的十三大和全国人大七届一次会议关于开展全民国防教育的精神，广泛开展以爱国主义为核心的全民国防教育，在全社会初步形成了热爱人民军队、关心支持国防建设的良好风尚。
    为了取得国防教育的实效性，吉林省各地利用各种教育手段和阵地，开展丰富多彩的教育活动。延边朝鲜族自治州利用各类学校、影剧院、展览馆、烈士陵园等场所，把国防教育扩展到社会的各个角落，做到电台广播有一讲，报刊宣传有一栏，电视节目有一项，文艺演出有一幕，板报画廊有一块。
  目前，全省共有2432个单位与部队结成“共建两个文明对子”，结合共建活动，帮助部队解决难题，办实事76200多件。
    各级政府还制定、完善了对现役军人家属、荣复转业军人的优待政策。现在，全省城镇建立军人家庭服务中心（站）5103个，农村建立为烈军属服务的组织10767个，同时，全省还积极为军烈属解决生活上的各种困难，共安置转业干部2514人，安置退伍战士23349人。各地普遍成立了退伍军人培训机构，加强了对退伍军人两用人才的再培训，充分发挥了他们在两个文明建设中的作用。
