I have traveled to many places and seen numerous bridges of various styles and ingenious designs, but the one that I admire the most is the small stone bridge in our Yao village in Hunan.

My hometown, Dongkou County's Dahu Yao Village, is like a green jade embedded in the Xuefeng Mountain range. The mountains are layered, and the valleys crisscross, with large and small streams and rivers scattered everywhere. Bridges have become the lifeline of transportation and daily life in the Yao village. They record the history of the rise and fall of the Yao village and have accompanied me through my dreamlike childhood.

From the time I could remember, bridges have been deeply etched in my heart. At that time, our Yao village did not have stone bridges. Wherever a bridge was needed, we would cut red pine trees from the mountains to use as bridge supports. We would then place four or five debarked Xuefeng red pines on top to form a bridge. During the spring and summer, once the mountain floods came, the wooden bridges that people had worked so hard to build would be washed away overnight, causing the bridges to be rebuilt every year and washed away by floods every year. This wasted a lot of manpower and resources. I remember one day in the spring of my first year of primary school, I braved the pouring rain and tightly held onto my father's clothes as we cautiously crossed the muddy river on a wooden bridge to go to school. However, just before it was time to go home, a flood surge roared down from upstream. The wooden bridge instantly disappeared. I was stranded at school and did not return home for three days. It was also that year when a neighbor, Aunt Shen, suddenly fell ill and was trapped in her home by the flood. She passed away in agony, leaving behind her family.

After that, the flood left a terrifying shadow in my young heart. I secretly vowed that when I grew up, I would personally build a very large stone bridge.

As I grew up, I became an engineer and built various types of bridges on rivers throughout the country, mastering the skill of bridge construction. How I wanted to build a stone bridge in the Yao village that my fellow villagers had longed for!

But in those days when we could barely fill our stomachs, how could we afford to build bridges?

The Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee finally brought spring to the Yao village. The steps of reform brought economic takeoff. The long-suffering Yao people became more astute, and the Party's rural economic policies directed their gaze towards the world outside the mountains. As the saying goes, "To get rich, first build roads." But the Yao people had their own ideas: "To get rich, first build bridges." In just ten years, the people of the Yao village, relying on their own strength, contributed money and labor to replace the wooden bridges that could not withstand floods with one stone arch bridge after another. In our Yao village, there is a place called Gaokanlong, where two steep mountains flank a turbulent river. On either side of the river, one side lives Yao people and the other side lives Han people. From ancient times, the people on both sides have shared the same river and the same bridge. Due to the ravages of floods, a wooden bridge built by the Yao and Han people with great effort was swallowed up, one after another. A few years ago, the Yao and Han brothers started singing the bridge-building song in the valley! Together, they raised more than 200,000 yuan to build the longest and most expensive stone arch bridge in the entire village. To commemorate the long-standing brotherly friendship and the joint struggle, they named the bridge the "Heart-Connecting Bridge."

Childhood friends, now the head of the village, Liu Zhicheng, told me that in the 10 years of reform, in our Yao village with a population of only over 4,000, we have raised more than 3 million yuan to build 64 large and small stone arch bridges, with a total length of over 4,000 meters, equivalent to the length of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

Even more delightful is that these large and small stone arch bridges have connected the ten villages and eight hamlets into one, forming a passage to the outside world.

Standing on the mountain top surrounded by the rivers of the Yao village, overlooking the river like a jade belt, those small stone bridges adorn the natural beauty of the Yao village, symbolizing the bright future of the Yao village.

### 我爱瑶乡小石桥

    我爱瑶乡小石桥
    黄明东（瑶族）
    我走过许多地方，见过不少风格迥异、巧夺天工的大小桥梁，然而，最令我为之赞美的，还是我们湖南瑶家山寨的小石桥。
    我的家乡洞口县大屋瑶族乡，像一块镶嵌在雪峰山脉中的绿色翡翠。山峦重叠，沟壑纵横，大小山涧河流星罗棋布。桥，成了瑶乡交通运输的纽带，日常生活的伴侣。她记录了瑶乡兴衰的历史，也伴我度过了梦幻般的童年。
    从我记事的时候起，桥就深深地印在我的心上，那时，我们瑶乡还没有石桥，需要架桥的地方，都是从山上砍来红松木做桥桩，用四五根剥光树皮的雪峰红杉往上一架，就算是桥了。春夏时节，一旦山洪暴发，人们辛辛苦苦架设的木桥，一夜之间就被冲得无影无踪，以致于年年架桥，年年被洪水冲走，不知耗费了多少财力物力。记得上小学一年级那年春季的一天，我冒着瓢泼大雨，紧紧拉住父亲的衣角，战战兢兢走过浑浊江水上的木桥去上学，谁知快放学时，一股洪峰从上游咆哮而下。木桥瞬间荡然无存。我被困在学校里，三天后才回到家中。也就是那一年，邻村的沈大婶突发急病，眼睁睁被洪水堵在家里，在痛苦的呻吟中，撇下全家老小离开了人世。
    那以后，洪水在我幼小的心灵里投下了可怕的阴影，我暗暗发誓，长大后一定要亲手修一座很大很大的石桥。
    长大了，我当上了工程兵，在祖国南北的河流上，架设了各式各样的桥梁，练就了一手过硬的架桥技术。我多么想在瑶乡的河流上修一座乡亲们期望的石桥啊！
    可是，在那连肚子都填不饱的年代里，又哪有能力去修桥呢？
    党的十一届三中全会，终于迎来了瑶乡的春天。改革的步履，带来了经济的腾飞。长期与贫困为伍的瑶乡人变得精明了，党的农村经济政策，把他们的眼光引向山外的世界，俗话说，“要想富，先修路”。可瑶乡人却有自己的主见：“要想富，必修桥”。在短短的十年时间里，瑶乡的群众凭着自己的力量，有钱出钱，有力出力，硬是把昔日经不起洪水冲击的木桥，换成了一座又一座石拱桥。我们瑶乡有一个叫高坎垄的地方，两座刀劈般的高山夹着一条湍急的河流，河的两岸，一边住着瑶族同胞，一边住着汉族兄弟，自古以来，两岸的人们同饮一江水共过一座桥。由于洪水肆虐，吞噬了一座又一座瑶汉同胞辛辛苦苦架设的木桥。前几年，瑶汉兄弟在河谷中喊开了架桥的号子！共同集资两万余元，修起了全乡范围内跨度最长、耗资最大的石拱桥，为了缅怀长期以来铸成的兄弟般的情谊，纪念共同奋斗的业绩，他们把这座桥命名为“连心桥”。
    儿时的伙伴，现在已是一乡之长的刘志成告诉我，改革的10年里，在我们这个只有4000多人口的瑶族乡，先后集资30多万元，修起了大大小小64座石拱桥，总长度达4000多米，相当于南京长江大桥的长度。
    更可喜的是，这些大大小小的石拱桥，把十里八寨连成了一片，构成了连接山外的通道。
    登上瑶乡江水环绕的山顶，俯瞰玉带般的河流。那一座座小石桥，装点着瑶乡的天然美色，象征着瑶乡的光明前景。
