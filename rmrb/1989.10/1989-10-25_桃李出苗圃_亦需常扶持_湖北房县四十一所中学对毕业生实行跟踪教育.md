The Fruits of the Nursery Also Need Constant Support – 41 Middle Schools in Hubei's Fang County Implement Tracking Education for Graduates

Xiong Ruilong, Ye Zhangsheng

“Enterprises need to implement 'three guarantees' for their products. Now, our county also has 41 middle schools that implement one to three years of tracking education for graduates who leave school, to help them succeed.” In early August, Li Shaoding, the director of the Fang County Education Commission in Hubei Province, happily told the reporters.

The first school to implement tracking education was Fang County Forestry Specialized High School. After returning to the mountainous rural area, female graduate Chen Xiuyan felt that the forestry technology she learned was not immediately applicable, and her future seemed bleak. After the school conducted a follow-up survey of graduates who returned to their hometowns, they invited her back to the school three times to learn practical technologies such as mushroom cultivation. At the same time, the school also sent teachers to her home for guidance. As a result, she developed a high-yield, high-quality mushroom cultivation technique called "shade production, ground spraying, and moisture absorption," becoming a "technological demonstration household" in the area.

The Fang County Education Commission summarized the practices of Fang County Forestry Specialized High School and, at the beginning of last year, decided to gradually implement "tracking education" in all ordinary and vocational middle schools in the county, emphasizing the principle of "leaving school but not forgetting education, going out to help them succeed." It was also announced that if any middle school graduate had legal or disciplinary issues within one to three years after leaving school, it would be considered as "sending out unqualified talents," and a performance evaluation system was established, holding the original middle school, principal, and class teacher accountable.

Fang County No. 1 Middle School adopted various methods for tracking education, such as having individual heart-to-heart talks with graduates before they leave school, visiting their homes after they graduate, writing letters to those who are admitted to colleges, inviting graduates who have left school to have discussions during vacations, organizing students who have returned from colleges to conduct social surveys, and visiting graduates during business trips.

In mid-May this year, the school sent two teachers to the homes of students who had been admitted to colleges, urging their parents to do ideological work on these students, not to join illegal organizations, and not to participate in demonstrations or sit-ins.

In late June, 18 students from the school who had been admitted to colleges returned to their hometowns. Fang County No. 1 Middle School organized a discussion with them, asking their original class teachers to have heart-to-heart talks with them, urging them not to collude, not to spread or believe in rumors, and to quickly return to school to resume classes, so that they could politically align with the Central Committee. A college student said, "Just when I was hesitating at a crossroads, my alma mater became my guiding mother, otherwise, I would have taken the wrong path!"

After returning to the countryside, a graduate of Qingfeng Middle School, Xiao Jin, felt hopeless. When he was wandering the streets, his teachers from the mother school came to his home, patiently guided him, and helped him find a job to learn edible fungus cultivation technology. He quickly borrowed money to start a fungus seedling farm. In more than a year, he not only repaid the loan and built a new house for his family but also helped the surrounding farmers develop black ear mushroom production.

A graduate of Shahe Middle School returned to the village and wanted to reform the local farming system but was opposed by his elderly family members and neighbors. After learning about this, the teachers from the mother school immediately went to his home to support him, helped him find technical guidance personnel, and provided relevant materials. He successfully explored a semi-arid cultivation method, doubling the yield of wheat and rice, and was called a "new farmer" by his fellow villagers. His parents were overjoyed.

Qiaoshang Middle School, together with the local youth organization, organized graduates who had returned to their hometowns in the past two years to learn practical technologies in mountainous areas, carry out voluntary road repairs, and help with poverty alleviation, among other colorful educational activities.

Currently, among the middle school graduates who have returned to their hometowns, more than 20 have joined the Communist Youth League, more than 30 have taken on positions as village or community cadres, and more than 110 households have been lifted out of poverty.

　　桃李出苗圃　亦需常扶持
　　——湖北房县四十一所中学对毕业生实行跟踪教育

    “企业要对出门的产品实行‘三包’。现在，我县也有41所中学对离校的毕业生实行一到三年的跟踪教育，促其成材。”8月上旬，湖北省房县教委主任李绍鼎高兴地告诉笔者。
    最先实行跟踪教育的是房县林特高中。该校女毕业生陈绪莲回到山区农村后，感到所学的林业技术远水不解近渴，生活前途渺茫。林特高中在对回乡毕业生跟踪调查中得知后，就让她三进学校，学习香菇栽培等实用技术。同时，学校还派教师上门对她进行指导。结果她摸索出“阴篷生产，地面喷水吸潮”的香菇优质高产栽培技术，成了当地“科技示范户”。
    房县教委总结了林特高中的做法，于去年年初作出决定，在全县普通中学、职业中学中逐步实行“离校不忘教，出门促成材”的跟踪教育，并宣布：凡是中学毕业生离校出门后的一至三年内发生违法乱纪等问题的，应视为“输送了不合格的人才”，制定出由原中学、校长、班主任负一定责任的考核制度。
    房县一中采取对毕业生离校前夕逐个谈心、毕业出门后进行家访、对考上大专院校的写信嘱托、假期邀请离校的毕业生座谈并组织从大专院校回乡的学生搞社会调查、利用出差机会走访毕业生等等办法进行跟踪教育。
    今年5月中旬，该校派出两名教师到考入大专院校的学生家，动员家长做这些学生的思想工作，不要去参加非法组织，不要去游行、静坐。
    6月上、中旬，从该校考入大专院校的18名学生回到家乡。一中召集他们座谈，请原班主任与他们交心，要求他们不串联、不信谣、不传谣，劝他们迅速返校复课，使他们在政治上与党中央保持一致。一位大学生说：“正当我徘徊在十字路口时，是母校当了我指路的母亲，不然就走错了路！”
    青峰中学毕业生小金回到农村后，感到人生无望。正当他游荡街头时，母校老师来到他家，耐心地开导他，并帮他联系单位，学习食用菌栽培技术。他很快贷款办起菌种场，一年多时间，他除还清贷款、家里盖起新房外，还帮周围农民发展起黑木耳生产。
    沙河中学一位毕业生回到村里后，想对当地耕作制度进行改革，但遭到家里老人和邻居的反对。母校教师得知后，立即登门予以支持，帮他请技术辅导人员，提供有关资料。他成功地探索出半旱式栽培法，使麦、稻单产翻了两番，被同村人称为“新农民”，父母听见后乐得合不拢嘴。桥上中学与当地团组织一道，组织近两年回乡的毕业生学习山区实用技术、开展义务修路、帮贫致富等丰富多彩的教育活动。
    目前，在回乡的中学毕业生中已有20多人入了团，30多人担任了村组干部，110多户家庭脱贫。
