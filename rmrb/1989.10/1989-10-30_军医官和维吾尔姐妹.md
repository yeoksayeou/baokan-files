In the autumn, at the home of Liu Yimin, the director of the outpatient department of the 17th Hospital of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kuche County, Xinjiang, there are often baskets of grapes, apricots, mulberries, watermelons, and melons from unknown people. Initially, he was puzzled, wondering who sent them. It was like a fairy tale where a fairy cooks for a farmer. Liu, the military doctor, also learned from the farmer to secretly follow the trail, only to find out that these "fairies" were all Uyghur women. Among them was his adopted daughter, Gunisha.

Gunisha is an employee of the Shahe County Flour Mill and is 24 years old. Half a year ago, she came to the hospital with her hands hugging her swollen belly seeking medical help. Gunisha's family said that they had visited several hospitals, all of which said she was pregnant, but a year had passed and the baby had not been born, and her body was getting worse. Liu Yimin carefully examined her and found that it was not a baby at all, but a giant ovarian cyst. To save the patient's life, surgery had to be performed as soon as possible. However, he had never seen such a case before and was somewhat hesitant. Gunisha noticed his thoughts and said in a trembling voice, "Doctor, please, just use me as an experiment."

Liu Yimin was taken aback and then felt his face flush with embarrassment. He finally made up his mind, formulated a detailed and meticulous surgical plan, and made various preparations for possible situations during the surgery. The next day, Gunisha was wheeled into the operating room. Her husband and relatives had made the worst preparations, buying white cloth and finding a horse-drawn carriage.

Outside the operating room, relatives and friends were waiting, and inside, it was so quiet that only the sound of instruments and the beating of hearts could be heard. Liu Yimin's face was covered in beads of sweat, and the surgical lights shone on a pair of astonished eyes. Two hours passed, and a 25.4-kilogram giant cyst, rare in China, was successfully removed. When he appeared tiredly at the door of the operating room, Gunisha's husband and relatives all said with tears in their eyes, "Thank you, thank you."

When she was discharged from the hospital, Gunisha and her husband came to his home and insisted on giving him 200 yuan to express their gratitude. He refused repeatedly, and Gunisha said, "Since you won't accept it, then promise me one thing, let me be your adopted daughter!" From then on, he had a Uyghur "daughter."

Liu Yimin is a gynecologist and continues to work as a gynecologist while serving as the director of the outpatient department. In his decades of clinical practice, he has welcomed the birth of thousands of newborns and has developed a deep friendship with the local Uyghur women. Last January, while he was in the countryside, he encountered a young Uyghur couple. The woman was named Reizi, and her husband, dissatisfied with her inability to have children after several years of marriage, drank alcohol every day and either beat or scolded her. Liu Yimin examined the couple and suggested that Reizi be hospitalized for surgery. A year later, the couple came to the hospital with their child to report the good news and wanted the child to recognize him as grandfather. He smiled and said, "Looking at my white hair, it's time for me to be a grandfather."

　　军医官和维吾尔姐妹
　　邓富昌　刘青峰
    金秋时节，驻新疆库车县解放军17医院接诊室主任刘毅民的家门前，时常有一些不知名姓的人悄悄放上一篮葡萄，或是一篮杏子、桑葚、几个西瓜哈密瓜什么的。开初，他很纳闷，是谁送的呢？这有些像电影里仙女给农夫做饭一样奇巧。刘军医也学着农夫悄悄盯梢，原来这些“仙女”都是维吾尔族妇女。其中还有他的干女儿古尼莎呢。
    古尼莎是沙雅县面粉厂的职工，今年24岁。半年前，她双手抱着隆起的肚子来到医院求诊。古尼莎的家人说，他们走了几家医院，都说她肚子里有了孩子，但一年过去了，仍不见孩子落地，而且身体越来越差。刘毅民为她仔细检查，发现根本不是什么孩子，而是一个巨大的卵巢囊肿。要挽救患者生命，只有尽快手术。但他从未见过这样的病例，心中有些踌躇。古尼莎看出了他的心思，用几乎颤抖的声音对他说，“医生，求求您了，就算在我身上做个试验吧”。刘军医先是一愣，继尔觉得脸上一阵火辣辣的。他终于下了决心，制定了详细周密的手术方案，对手术中可能遇到的情况，做了种种设想，采取了相应的措施。第二天，古尼莎被推进了手术室。她的丈夫和亲属，作了最坏的打算，买来了白布，找来了马车。
    手术室外围满了等候的亲友，室内静得只听见器械的响声，还有互相感觉到的心跳声，刘军医脸上冒出了豆大的汗珠，无影灯照着一双双惊异的眼睛。两个小时过去了，一个在我国罕见的25.4公斤重的巨大囊肿终于被顺利摘除了。当他疲惫地出现在手术室门口时，古尼莎的丈夫和亲属都含着热泪齐声说：“热合买提，热合买提（维语：谢谢你）”。出院时，古尼莎夫妇来到他家中，一定要送给他200元钱表示感谢，他千推万挡没有接。古尼莎说：“既然您不肯收，那就答应我一件事，让我做您干女儿吧！”从此，他就有了个维吾尔族“女儿”。
    刘军医是妇产科医生，当了接诊室主任还继续兼任妇产科医生。在几十年的临床生涯中，他迎接了成百上千小生命的降临，与驻地维吾尔妇女结下了深厚的情谊。去年元月，他下乡时碰上一对维吾尔族青年夫妇，女的叫热依孜，丈夫嫌她结婚数年不生育，天天喝酒，对她不是打就是骂。刘军医为这对夫妇作了检查，建议热依孜住院作手术治疗。一年后，夫妇俩抱着孩子到医院向他报喜，并要孩子认他做爷爷。他笑着说：“看我满头白发，也该当爷爷了。”
