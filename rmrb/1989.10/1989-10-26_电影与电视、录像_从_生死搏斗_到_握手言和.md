From the early 20th century to the 1960s, films drew people out of their homes and into movie theaters. By the 1970s, and especially in the 1980s, television and videotape gradually pulled audiences back into their homes. In countries where television and videotape penetration rates are high, movie theaters have experienced a temporary decline. Statistics show: In 1960, the UK had 1 billion movie theater attendees, which dropped to 550 million by 1984. In 1975, Italy had 550 million attendees, which dropped to 160 million by 1985. In France, 53% of people no longer go to movie theaters. In the Soviet Union, each person now watches an average of 14 films per year, but in the early 1970s, it was 19. In the early 1960s, Egypt had 450 movie theaters, but now only about 170 remain. India, known as the "film capital of the East," had approximately 12,000 theaters forced to close in 1988. Japan's movie theaters are also decreasing year by year, with nearly 50 closing each year. Some film industry professionals refer to the competition between television/videotape and film as a "life and death struggle."

As new forms of artistic expression, television and videotape indeed have advantages that film cannot match: First, watching television or videotape at home is more convenient and comfortable than going to a movie theater. Second, the number of television channels is increasing, offering a rich variety of programs, especially pay-per-view cable and pay-per-view television, which can show the latest films. Third, in countries with a developed videotape industry, renting movie videotapes is generally much cheaper than going to the theater. Fourth, television news is more frequent and faster than documentary news. Fifth, unique television series and popular special programs can easily attract viewers to the television at scheduled times.

However, a true art form will never be completely replaced by a newer art form. After a period of "life and death struggle," film and television/videotape are now shaking hands and reconciling, moving towards coordinated development. This is evident in:

First, films themselves are undergoing adaptive changes. For example, in terms of form, there have been developments from stereoscopic images and surround sound with wide screens and giant screens to panoramic and dome-shaped 3D films, with meticulously produced epic films. In terms of content, in recent years, foreign countries have produced many commercial science fiction, comedy, and thriller films. At the same time, directors committed to film art have turned their cameras to people's daily lives, producing many films that depict the ethics and morals of ordinary families. In terms of artistry, films have absorbed the highly realistic characteristics of television, using non-professional actors to create films that are as close to reality as possible. In terms of operation, they have also absorbed the advantages of television's multiple channels and free choice, leading to the rise of "multi-functional theaters" or "complex theaters," where a single theater has multiple screening rooms showing different films simultaneously.

Second, film and television are merging. One approach is the dual-track system, where television stations, especially pay-per-view cable and pay-per-view television, purchase the broadcasting rights of films from film production companies; film companies, in addition to producing films, also produce television dramas. Another approach is film and television integration, where film companies also operate television stations to control their own economic lifelines.

Third, pay-per-view cable, pay-per-view television, and movie videotapes have opened up new markets for films. In the United States, film production companies, especially "independent producers" who produce films with budgets of no more than $5 million, can now easily achieve cost recovery or profit through selling broadcasting rights to cable television, even if they do not have significant box office revenue. Selling movie videotape distribution rights to thriving movie videotape manufacturers has also become a new source of income for various film companies in the United States.

In summary, film and television/videotape, as different art forms, cannot replace each other. They will continue to develop in a process of mutual competition and mutual promotion, constantly seeking new developments.

　　电影与电视、录像
　　——从“生死搏斗”到“握手言和”
　　范中汇
    本世纪初至六十年代，电影把人们从家里吸引进了电影院；进入七十年代，特别是八十年代以来，电视和录像却逐渐地把电影院的观众拉回了家里。在电视、录像普及率较高的许多国家里，电影院一时萧条起来。统计资料表明：英国在一九六零年电影院观众是十亿人次，一九八四年下降到五千五百万人次。意大利在一九七五年是五点五亿人次，一九八五年下降到一点六亿人次。法国有百分之五十三的人已根本不去电影院。苏联现在每人每年平均看十四次电影，但在七十年代初是十九次。埃及在六十年代初拥有四百五十家电影院，目前只剩下一百七十多家。号称东方电影大国的印度，一九八八年全国竟大约有一点二万家影院被迫关门。日本的电影院也逐年减少，几乎每年关闭约五十家。有些电影界人士把电视、录像与电影的竞争称为“生死搏斗”。
    电视、录像作为新兴的艺术传播形式，确有电影不可企及的长处：一、坐在家里看电视、录像，要比去电影院方便舒适；二、电视频道越来越多，节目丰富多彩，特别是付费有线电视、付费点片电视更可看到最新影片；三、在录像业发达的国家，租用电影录像带一般都比去影院看电影节省得多；四、电视新闻比纪录片新闻又多又快；五、独具特色的电视连续剧和热门专题节目，很容易把人们按时吸引到电视机前来。
    但是，一门真正的艺术是绝不会被后起的艺术完全代替的。电影和电视、录像经过了一段“生死搏斗”之后，正在握手言和，走上协调发展的道路，这表现在：
    第一，电影本身进行适应性变革。如在形式上，先是出现了立体画面、立体声配以宽银幕、巨形银幕，现在更有环幕、穹幕全景立体电影，并精心制作一些豪华巨片；在内容上，国外近年来拍摄了不少商业性的科幻片、喜剧片、惊险片，同时，一些有志于电影艺术的导演则把镜头伸向人们的日常生活，拍摄了不少表现普通人家庭生活的伦理道德片；在艺术上，电影吸取了电视富有强烈真实感的特点，选用一些非职业性演员，拍摄最接近真实性的影片；在经营上，也吸取了电视多频道自由选择的优点，兴起了“多功能影院”或叫“复合影院”的结构，即一座影院内兼有多个不同的放映厅，同时放映不同的影片。
    第二，电影、电视走向“合流”。一是电影、电视双轨制，即电视台，特别是付费有线电视和付费点片电视购买电影制片公司的影片播映权；电影公司则除拍电影外，兼搞电视剧。再就是电影、电视一体化，即电影公司兼营电视台，以掌握自己的经济命脉。
    第三，付费有线电视、付费点片电视和电影录像带为电影开辟了新的销路。美国的电影制片公司，特别是“独立制片人”制作的成本不超过五百万美元的影片，即使没有多少票房收入，现在也很容易通过向有线电视出售播放权而达到收支平衡或盈利。而向生意兴隆的电影录像带制作商出卖电影录像发行权，已成为美国各电影公司的新财源。
    总之，电影和电视、录像作为不同的艺术门类，谁也代替不了谁，它们将在既相互竞争又相互促进的矛盾运动中，不断求得各自的新发展。
