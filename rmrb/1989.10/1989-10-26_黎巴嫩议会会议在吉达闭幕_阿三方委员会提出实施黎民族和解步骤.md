The Lebanese Parliament session concluded today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal, representing the Arab Three-Party Committee, issued a statement regarding the Taif Lebanese Parliament session and the steps to be taken to resolve the Lebanese crisis.

The statement emphasized that the agreement reached by Lebanese deputies in Taif indicates that the only way to resolve the Lebanese crisis is through the true laws of Lebanon. Achieving peace and restoring constitutional institutions to ensure Lebanon's unity, sovereignty, and independence is the only path to this resolution.

The statement pointed out that the agreement outlined the basic steps to be followed, including: convening a parliamentary session; approving the National Reconciliation Charter; electing a president; forming a National Reconciliation Government; and taking constitutional measures to implement the Charter. To this end, the Arab Three-Party Committee will spare no effort to create conditions and provide assistance for these steps. The Committee called on relevant international parties, especially the Security Council and its permanent members, to fulfill their responsibilities and use all means to implement Resolution 425 and other relevant Security Council resolutions aimed at eliminating Israeli occupation.

Regarding the security and defense tasks of the Syrian army in Lebanon, the statement noted that the Three-Party Committee has reached a comprehensive agreement and full understanding with Syria. According to the agreement, Syrian forces will complete their security mission in Lebanon within two years. During this period, the Lebanese regular army will fully take over the security responsibilities assumed by the Syrian forces, and the Syrian forces will redeploy according to the regions specified in the Reconciliation Charter. Thereafter, the governments of Syria and Lebanon will sign an agreement on the duration of the Syrian forces' presence in these regions, and the Arab Summit will pay attention to the approval and implementation of this agreement.

The statement reaffirmed the resolutions of the Arab Summit regarding helping Lebanon end the civil war, overcome the disaster, and restore normalcy.

Finally, based on the decisions of the Summit, the Arab Three-Party Committee proposed the following: 1. Requesting the leaders of the Lebanese conference to convene a parliamentary session on November 7 this year to elect the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and members of the parliamentary office, approve the Lebanese National Reconciliation Charter, and elect a president; 2. The parliamentary office will coordinate with the representative of the Three-Party Committee, Ibrahim, and relevant parties to ensure the security of the parliamentary session; 3. Through consultations among all parties, Ibrahim will formulate a special security plan to provide necessary protection for the convening of the session and ensure the safety of deputies; 4. Ibrahim will immediately take necessary measures to implement these steps.

King Fahd received the Lebanese deputies attending the conference, expressing hope that the documents would be implemented and that a president would be elected quickly to form a unity government. He stated that the Arab world would not abandon Lebanon.

The foreign ministers of Algeria, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia attended the reception ceremony.

Lebanese Speaker Hussein expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Saudi King and believed that through efforts, Lebanon's peace could gradually be achieved. Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal read the statement of the Three-Party Committee after the banquet.

According to reports, Saudi King Fahd had a telephone conversation with Moroccan King Hassan II and Algerian President Chadli last night, briefing them on the conference situation. The three leaders exchanged views on the steps to implement the National Reconciliation document. The presidents of Egypt and the United States also called King Fahd to congratulate Saudi Arabia on its important contribution to resolving the Lebanese crisis.
