The Communist Party of China's Shaanxi Provincial Committee Office recently issued a notice to the entire province regarding the incident where discipline inspection official Pu Ming was attacked and beaten, resulting in his death due to ineffective treatment. The notice calls for all levels of party organizations to strongly support the work of discipline inspection agencies and other supervisory departments, protect their legal rights, and fully utilize their crucial role in combating corruption and strengthening party discipline.

Pu Ming was originally a discipline inspection official at the Comprehensive Survey and Research Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Industry. In January 1987, based on the decision of the institute's party committee, Pu Ming actively participated in investigating the issue of certain individuals in the institute's medical clinic using their positions for personal gain and enriching themselves. He faced repeated attacks from the individuals being investigated, including Sun Yixing's brother. With the support of the institute's party committee, Pu Ming and other discipline inspection officials overcame interference and persisted in their investigation. On June 30 of the same year, Sun Yixing and others, under the pretext of causing trouble for the institute's leaders, physically attacked the leaders. Pu Ming and others stepped in to stop their illegal actions. That afternoon, Pu Ming was attacked and beaten by Sun Yixing, exacerbating his existing liver disease. Despite the hospital's efforts to save him, he died. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Government has approved the posthumous recognition of Pu Ming as a revolutionary martyr.

The criminal Sun Yixing, who harmed Pu Ming, fled in July 1987 and was captured in January 1988. In July of this year, Sun Yixing was sentenced to 13 years in prison and deprived of his political rights for 3 years by the Beilin District Court in Xi'an.

The Shaanxi Provincial Committee Office also requires all levels of party organizations to promptly assist discipline inspection and supervisory officials in resolving and overcoming problems and difficulties encountered in their work. Those who retaliate, defame, or persecute these officials must be publicly dealt with seriously. If they violate criminal laws, they must be severely and swiftly punished according to the law.

    纪检干部庹明以身殉职  犯罪分子受到法律制裁
    新华社西安10月9日电（记者华年轮）中共陕西省委办公厅最近就纪检干部庹明遭报复毒打、救治无效、以身殉职一事，向全省发出通报，要求各级党组织旗帜鲜明地支持纪检机关和其他监督部门的工作，维护他们的合法权益，充分发挥他们在惩治腐败、加强党风建设中的重要作用。
    庹明原系机械电子工业部综合勘察研究院的纪检干部。1987年元月，庹明根据院党委决定，积极参加调查院医务所个别人以医谋私、中饱私囊的问题，屡遭被审查对象之弟孙毅星等人的围攻。在院党委的支持下，庹明等纪检干部排除干扰，坚持办案。同年6月30日，孙毅星等借故找院领导取闹，并动手对院领导报复伤害，因庹明等同志挺身而出，制止了他们的违法行为。当天下午，庹明即遭到孙毅星报复毒打，致使庹明原有的肝病恶化，经医院多方抢救无效而死亡。陕西省人民政府已批准追认他为革命烈士。
    残害庹明的暴徒孙毅星于1987年7月畏罪潜逃，1988年1月被捉拿归案。今年7月，孙毅星被西安市碑林区法院判处有期徒刑13年，剥夺其政治权利3年。
    陕西省委办公厅在通报中还要求各级党组织及时帮助纪检和监督干部解决、排除在工作中遇到的问题和困难，对于那些打击报复、诬陷迫害这些干部的人，要认真公开处理，触犯刑律的，要依法从严从快惩处。
