The Dow Jones Industrial Average of the New York Stock Exchange closed at 2657.38 points today, up 88.12 points from October 13. Trading activity was also exceptionally active, with a turnover of 416 million shares.

Experts analyzed that the main reason the New York stock market did not experience a crisis today was due to the effective intervention of the Federal Reserve, and stock investors also learned from the lessons of the 1987 "Black Monday." The rebound of the Dow Jones Index has eased the tension in the United States, but some stock market analysts warn that the New York stock market is still relatively fragile, and the possibility of significant fluctuations in the near future cannot be ruled out.

According to the latest reports from the British Broadcasting Corporation and the British Independent Broadcasting Corporation, after the news of the United States' August trade deficit reaching the highest level of the year was released, the London stock market, which had shown signs of stabilization this morning, plummeted again in the afternoon, with the Financial Times 100 Index falling nearly 40 points.

Yesterday, the London stock market experienced a sharp decline, but due to the rebound in the New York stock market, the London stock market avoided the "massacre" that was originally expected in the afternoon, showing signs of recovery. As a result, the London stock market closed at 2163.4, down 70.5 points, with a loss of over 20 billion pounds in stock value. The new plunge has put the London stock market in a state of tension and anxiety.

Due to the sharp decline in the New York stock market, the Tokyo stock market also experienced a significant drop today.

At the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the stock average price this morning fell by 611.52 yen compared to last weekend, marking the largest drop of the year. Last weekend, the average stock price at the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 34,708.18 yen. Later, affected by the appreciation of the yen, the stock price showed signs of recovery, and the closing price was 34,468.69 yen.

Yesterday morning, the Paris stock market opened and fell sharply until noon, dropping a total of 29.69 points. After the New York stock market showed signs of stabilization, the Paris stock market rebounded at 1 PM today.

Under the influence of the falling trend in the New York Wall Street stock market, the West German stock market experienced its largest decline in over 40 years since the war yesterday.

According to statistics, the average index of 30 major stocks fell by 203.56 points, and the total loss in the face value of stocks at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange was 60 billion marks.

    世界主要股市均呈跌势
    部分股市开始回升  近期波动仍有可能
    本报华盛顿10月16日电　记者张亮报道：纽约证券交易所道·琼斯30种工业股票平均指数今天收盘时为2657.38点，比13日回升88.12点，整个交易活动也异常活跃，成交量高达4.16亿股。
    专家们分析，今天纽约股市未发生危机的主要原因是由于联邦储备委员会的有效干预，同时股票投资者也吸取了1987年“黑色星期一”的经验教训。道·琼斯指数回升使美国人松了口气，但一些股市分析家告诫说，纽约股票市场行情依然比较脆弱，近期内剧烈波动的可能性不能排除。
    本报伦敦10月17日电　记者陈特安报道：据英国广播公司和英国独立广播电台最新消息，在美国8月份贸易赤字创下今年以来最高纪录的消息公布后15分钟内，今晨已趋缓解的伦敦股票市场行情下午又一次猛跌，伦敦《金融时报》100种股票价格指数下跌了近40个点。
    昨天，伦敦股市行情曾暴跌，由于受纽约股市行情回升的带动，昨天下午伦敦股票市场避开了人们原来预计的“血洗”伦敦股市的厄运，有所回升。结果，昨天伦敦股票市场以2163.4收盘，只下跌70.5点，股票价值损失200多亿英镑。新的猛跌又使伦敦股市处在紧张不安之中。
    新华社东京10月16日电　受纽约股票市场行情暴跌的影响，东京股票市场行情今天也大幅度下跌。
    在东京证券交易所，早晨股票平均价格比上周末下跌了611.52日元，成为今年下跌幅度最大的一次。上周末，东京证券交易所的股票平均价格是34708.18日元。后来受日元升值的影响，股票价格有所回升，收盘价格为34468.69日元。
    本报巴黎10月17日电　记者吕网大报道：巴黎股票市场昨天上午开盘到中午，一路猛跌，共下跌29.69点。美国纽约股市趋向平缓后，今天中午1时，巴黎股市已回升。
    本报斯图加特10月17日电　记者江建国报道：在纽约华尔街股市跌风推波助澜的影响下，西德股票市场昨天经历了战后四十多年来最大的一次下跌。
    据统计，30种主要股票的平均指数下跌了203.56点，在法兰克福股票交易所股票票面价值损失总计600亿马克。
