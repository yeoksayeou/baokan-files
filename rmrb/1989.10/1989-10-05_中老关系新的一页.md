News of the imminent visit of Kaysone Phomvihane, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, to China has spread joy among the people here. Before the Chinese National Day, Lao newspapers, television, and radio stations published editorials and articles praising the achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China over the past 40 years and the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries. This further enhanced the friendly atmosphere before Kaysone's visit to China. People of all ethnic groups in Laos watched with excitement the exhibition of China's 40-year achievements and the film show held in Vientiane. Kaysone's visit this time will open a new chapter in the relations between the two countries.

China and Laos are neighboring countries with traditional friendship. The two countries share a 400-kilometer-long border, and friendly exchanges can be traced back more than 1,700 years. Especially since the founding of New China, exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in politics, economy, trade, and other fields have been closer than ever before. The China-Laos Friendship Highway in the northern part of Laos is a prominent example. This is a transportation artery from Yunnan Province in China to the three northern provinces of Laos, built by China to help Laos in April 1961 when the two countries formally established diplomatic relations. The Lao people often recall it. A Lao friend recently published an article in the Lao People's Daily, saying that this 800-kilometer-long highway is like a bond of friendship between the peoples of the two countries. It is a result of the sweat of Chinese workers. At that time, Chinese workers built water supply systems and reservoirs along the highway for the villages, providing great convenience for the local people's water use.

Kaysone's official visit this time is the result of the joint efforts of both sides over the years to improve and develop relations between the two countries. In December 1986, the two countries' deputy foreign ministers held their first meeting in Vientiane since the two countries' relations encountered many twists and turns in 1979. The following November, the two countries' deputy foreign ministers met again in Beijing, and the two sides reached an agreement to restore and develop relations between the two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In June 1988, the two countries resumed the exchange of ambassadors. In August this year, Thongsavanh Keobounphanh, First Deputy Foreign Minister and First Deputy Head of the Department of International Relations of Laos, visited China and reached a consensus on restoring relations between the two parties. In September, the two countries signed a consular agreement and a visa exemption agreement. To further develop friendly relations between the two countries, the Secretariat of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party recently reappointed the leadership of the Lao-China Friendship Association.

Looking back on the past, people have more expectations for the future of China-Laos friendly relations. A Lao official said that the two countries have the same social system. Both countries are currently carrying out economic reforms and opening up to the outside world under the leadership of the party. We need to learn from each other, exchange experiences, and develop together. A worker said that he was very happy to hear the news of Kaysone's visit to China. He believes that economic and trade exchanges between the two countries will increase in the future, which is beneficial to the people of both countries.

Accompanied by officials from the Lao Foreign Ministry, we visited the main markets in Vientiane. The abundance of Chinese goods here surprised us, including bicycles from Guangdong, electric fans from Suzhou, grapes from Qingdao, Tonghua, and Dangshan, traditional Chinese medicine from Beijing Tongrentang, ginseng essence from Jilin, male gems from Tianjin, menthol from Shanghai, and even cloth shoes from Kunming. Some stores have set up special counters for Chinese goods since the beginning of this year. The owner of a store selling Chinese goods excitedly told us: Lao people welcome Chinese goods, and Chinese goods are popular here. According to the manager of the largest department store in Vientiane, most of the Chinese goods in the store come from third countries, and the number of goods coming directly from China is still small. He hopes that the improvement and development of friendly relations between the two countries will allow more Chinese goods to enter the Lao market directly.

Both China and Laos are developing countries. Both countries face the arduous task of developing their own economies. In the past two years, with the increase in personnel exchanges between the two countries, trade exchanges between the two countries have become more frequent. At present, the trade volume at the border between the two countries has exceeded the highest level in history. The prospects for economic and trade cooperation between the two countries are broad. Laos plans to send a delegation to participate in the autumn Canton Fair this year to further expand the trade volume between the two countries. The Chinese side expressed that it will actively participate in investment projects in Laos.

Kaysone's visit to China this time will be conducive to consolidating and developing friendly relations between the two countries and will further promote the development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.

    中老关系新的一页
    本报记者  刘爱成  新华社记者  黄勇
    老挝部长会议主席、老挝人民革命党中央委员会总书记凯山·丰威汉即将访华的消息在此间传开后，人们十分喜悦。中国国庆节前后，老挝报纸、电视和广播分别发表社论和文章，赞扬中国人民在中国共产党领导下40年来的成就和老中两国人民的传统友谊，更增添了凯山主席访华前两国友好的气氛。老挝各族人民怀着激动的心情观看了在万象市举办的中国40年成就图片展览和电影晚会。凯山主席的这次访问，为两国关系揭开了新的一页。
    中老两国是有着传统友谊的邻邦。两国有400多公里长的共同边界，友好交往可追溯到1700多年前。特别是在新中国成立后，两国在政治、经济和贸易等方面的交往和合作比过去任何时候都密切。上寮老中友谊公路便是突出的一例。那是中老两国1961年4月宣布正式建交之后，中国帮助老挝修建的一条从我国云南省通往老挝北部三省的交通干线。至今老挝人民常常提起。一位老挝朋友最近在老挝《人民报》上发表文章说，这条长达800公里的公路，如同老中人民之间友谊的纽带。它是中国工人阶级用汗水浇灌成的。当时中国工人沿公路为各村修建了自来水系统和蓄水池，为当地人民用水提供了极大的方便。
    凯山主席这次正式访问是中老双方多年来共同为改善和发展两国关系积极努力的结果。1986年12月，中老两国副外长在万象举行自1979年中老两国关系遭遇多年曲折后的首次会晤。次年11月，两国副外长在北京再次会晤，双方就在和平共处五项原则基础上恢复和发展两国关系达成协议。1988年6月，两国重新互派大使。今年8月，老挝第一副外长兼中联部第一副部长通沙瓦·凯坎皮吞访问中国，就恢复两党关系达成一致意见。9月，两国草签了领事协定和互免签证协定。为进一步发展两国友好关系，老挝人民革命党书记处最近重新任命了老中友协领导成员。
    人们回顾过去，更多地期望着中老友好关系的未来。一位老挝干部说，老中两国社会制度相同。目前两国都在进行党领导下的经济改革和对外开放政策。我们彼此需要学习、交流、共同发展。一位工人说，他听到凯山主席访华的消息后感到十分高兴。他认为中老两国今后的经济贸易往来将会增加，这对两国人民有利。
    我们在老挝外交部干部的陪同下走访了万象市的主要市场。这里中国商品之多使我们惊奇不已，有广东的自行车，苏州的电风扇，青岛、通化、砀山等地的葡萄酒，北京同仁堂的中药，吉林的人参精，天津的男宝，上海的清凉油，乃至昆明的布鞋等等。有的商店还从今年年初起增设了中国商品专柜。一家出售中国商品的商店主人兴奋地告诉我们：老挝人十分欢迎中国货，中国货在这里畅销。据万象市最大的百货公司负责人介绍，该商店的中国商品多数从第三国转来，从中国直接来的数量还占少数。他非常希望老中两国友好关系的改善和发展使更多的中国商品直接进入老挝市场。
    中老两国都是发展中国家。两国都面临着发展本国经济的艰巨任务。近两年来，随着两国人员往来的增加，两国间的贸易往来日益频繁。目前两国边境贸易额已超过历史最高水平。中老两国进行经济贸易合作的前景广阔。老挝方面计划派团参加今年秋季广交会，以进一步扩大两国贸易额，中国方面表示将积极参加对老挝的投资项目。
    凯山主席的这次访华，有利于中老两国友好关系的巩固与发展，将进一步推动中老两国经济和贸易合作的开展。
