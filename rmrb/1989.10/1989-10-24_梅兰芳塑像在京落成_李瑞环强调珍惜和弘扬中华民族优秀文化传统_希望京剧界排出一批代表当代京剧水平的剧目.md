The statue of China's renowned opera master Mei Lanfang was unveiled today in Beijing.

The marble bust, located in the courtyard of the Mei Lanfang Memorial Hall, was jointly created by sculptor master Liu Kaituo and his student Bai Langeng. Li Ruihong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Hab Zongxun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, jointly unveiled the statue. Over 100 representatives from various sectors of the capital city applauded enthusiastically to celebrate the unveiling.

Li Ruihong, while visiting the exhibition hall of the memorial, said: We must cherish and carry forward the excellent cultural traditions of the Chinese nation. Inheritance and development must first inherit excellent cultural traditions. Without inheritance, there is no development. Only by inheriting the excellent traditions of our national culture can we build a socialist culture. We must oppose cultural nihilism. We should understand that the more national something is, the more it can go global. Foreigners criticize our shortcomings, but they respect our excellent national cultural traditions.

Seeing the stage photos of Mei Lanfang's performances and discussing Mei Lanfang's artistic contributions, Li Ruihong pointed out that to revitalize Peking Opera, we need leadership attention, audience support, and the joint efforts of Peking Opera artists. He hopes that the Peking Opera community will concentrate their efforts to produce a batch of works that represent the contemporary level of Peking Opera. Collective wisdom is better than individual struggle.

Mei Lanfang began his artistic training at the age of five and dedicated over 60 years to the opera stage. He inherited traditions, dared to innovate, was meticulous, and pursued excellence. He excelled in singing, speaking, acting, and fighting, and made significant contributions to Peking Opera music, dance, makeup, and stage settings. He formed a unique and grand artistic style known as the Mei School, playing a crucial role in the development of Chinese opera art by bridging the past and the future.

　　梅兰芳塑像在京落成
　　李瑞环强调珍惜和弘扬中华民族优秀文化传统
　　希望京剧界排出一批代表当代京剧水平的剧目
    据新华社北京10月23日电  （记者邵建武）我国卓越的戏曲艺术大师梅兰芳的塑像今天在北京落成。
    安座在梅兰芳纪念馆庭院中的这座汉白玉半身塑像是由雕塑大师刘开渠及其学生白澜生共同创作的。中共中央政治局常委李瑞环和全国人大常委会副委员长习仲勋共同为塑像揭幕。首都各界人士100多人以热烈的掌声庆贺塑像的落成。
    李瑞环在参观纪念馆陈列室时说：一定要珍惜和弘扬中华民族的优秀文化传统。继承和发展，首先要继承优秀文化传统，没有继承，就没有发展。只有继承了我们民族文化的优秀传统，才能建设社会主义文化，我们要反对民族虚无主义。应该明白：越是民族的东西，越是能走向世界。外国人批评我们的不足，但他们很尊重我们民族的优秀文化传统。
    看到梅兰芳生前演出的剧照，谈起梅兰芳的艺术贡献，李瑞环指出，要振兴京剧，一靠领导重视，二靠观众支持，更要靠京剧界人士齐心合力。他希望京剧界集中力量，排练出一批代表当代京剧水平的剧目。群策群力比个人奋斗要好得多。
    梅兰芳自5岁学艺，在戏曲舞台上奋斗了60多个春秋，他继承传统，勇于创新，一丝不苟，精益求精，集唱、念、做、打于一身，在京剧音乐、舞蹈、化妆和舞台装置等方面都有建树，形成了风格独特、洋洋大观的艺术流派——梅派，为中国戏曲艺术的发展起到了承先启后的作用。
