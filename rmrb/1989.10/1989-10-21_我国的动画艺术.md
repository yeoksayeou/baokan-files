There is a form of art that we started late but progressed quickly, achieving remarkable results yet still falling short. Artists are both joyful and troubled. This is the animation art of our country.

Animation, known as cartoons (films or television shows) abroad, is derived from comics. The popularity of comics in our country lagged behind Europe by two or three hundred years, so the emergence of animation in our country was naturally delayed. Before liberation, people only knew of three animators—the Wan brothers. How many animation films could three people produce? In any case, I never saw any during that time. It was only after liberation that our country began to have animation studios. Starting so late, but our artists did not hesitate. A film like "Havoc in Heaven" made waves in Europe and brought back a grand prize, followed by continuous awards. Other animation films also won awards internationally and domestically. Someone told me that in various international film competitions, animation films win the most awards. How can artists not be happy about this?

Now we have television, and there are dedicated television broadcasts for animation. In Shenzhen, you can watch Hong Kong television programs. Hong Kong has four television stations, each broadcasting several hours of animation daily, mostly from Japan and the West. Our television stations also broadcast our own animations. Children are captivated, demanding more. But our animations are too few. Animation production faces various restrictions, making it difficult to produce more. Television stations have to broadcast foreign films to meet audience demands, which has sparked some criticism.

To promote the development of animation art, the Central Television Station, with the support of enthusiastic sponsors, held a nationwide exhibition and awards ceremony for television and film animation programs. At the award ceremony in Shanghai and the subsequent symposium in Beijing, Yuan Ruolin, deputy director and secretary-general of the China Television Art Committee, repeatedly called for substantial support for animation art. Our animation is on a bumpy road. We have the talent; we have the technology, and not only that, we have a unique technique—watercolor animation—that foreigners do not have. Starting late, there are naturally many technological gaps compared to foreigners. There are fewer talents, but there is a valuable advantage: in production, we are more meticulous and do not have as many obvious defects as some foreign animations influenced by commercial interests; in art, we are more refined. The shortcomings are mostly technical issues. Works like "Havoc in Heaven," "Three Monks," and "Mountains and Rivers" are not only rich in national characteristics but also excellent in art. Both children and adults are captivated. The animations that win international awards are of this kind.

Animation comes in various types, and its artistic qualities manifest in many ways. Some are exquisite in production, some are moving in story, some are humorous, and so on. For animation, humor is its most distinctive artistic feature. In Disney's "Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck," I appreciate Donald Duck and the two little squirrels the most. The personalities and movements of these small animals are vividly portrayed with humorous techniques. The Czech films "The Mole's Story" and "The Good Soldier Švejk" (puppet film) also have this artistic feature. In our animations, apart from a few films like "Three Monks" and "Super Soap" directed by Ada and designed by Han Yu, there are not many works rich in humor. I feel this is the most obvious weakness in our animation art. Many excellent animation films, even fairy tales like "Snow White" and the magical musical animation "Fantasia," all use humorous artistic techniques, making them lively and engaging. In this national animation exhibition, the works that won the grand prize and first and second prizes were all created by cartoonists and those skilled in using humorous techniques, which is not a coincidence. Currently, there are few such talents in animation production, limiting the development of animation art, which is worth noting.

### 我国的动画艺术

　　我国的动画艺术
　　方成
    现在有一种艺术，我们起步很迟，但进展很快，成绩斐然而还不足，艺术家既欢欣又苦恼，这就是我国的动画。
    动画，外国叫卡通（影片或电视片），那是由漫画衍生而出的。我国漫画流行比外国（欧洲）迟两三百年，我们动画的出现自然也是迟的。解放前人们只知道三位动画家——万氏三兄弟。三个人能制出多少动画片呢？反正那时我一部也没见过。只在解放后我国才开始有动画制片厂。起步这么晚，但我们的艺术家干起来不含糊，一个《大闹天宫》，闹到欧洲，就捧得个大奖杯回来，连连续续，别的动画片也在国际国内不断获奖。有人告诉我，在各类影片的国际比赛中，得奖最多的就属动画，艺术家能不高兴吗？
    现在有电视了，有专为电视播放的录相片，动画在电视中广为传播。在深圳能看到香港电视节目。香港有四个电视台，每天都播放几个小时的动画，大都是日本和欧美产品。我们的电视台也播放自己的动画，孩子们看得入迷，要求多播。但我们的动画太少，动画制作受种种限制，无法多生产，电视台只好放外国片子来满足观众的要求，因而又引起不少意见。
    为推动动画艺术的发展，中央电视台在得到热心赞助之下举办了全国影视动画节目展播并评奖。在上海的颁奖会和后来在北京的座谈会上，担任中国电视艺术委员会副主任兼秘书长的阮若琳几次大声疾呼，要求对动画艺术大力资助。我国动画正处在坎坷路上。人才，我们有；技术，我们也有，不但有，还有外国所无的绝活儿——水墨动画技术。起步迟，技术上和外国比自然有不少差距。人才较少，但有一项可贵的优点，就是在制作上比较认真，不像现在看到的一些外国动画那样受商情影响有那么多明显粗制的毛病；在艺术上也比较考究。有所不足那多属于技术问题。像《大闹天宫》《三个和尚》《山水情》这样既富有民族特色，艺术上又出色的作品，就不仅是孩子，大人看了也入迷。在国际上获奖的就是这类动画。
    动画种类不一，其艺术性表现在多方面，有的在于制作精美，有的在于故事感人，有的在于幽默等等。对于动画而言，幽默是它最明显的艺术特色。在迪斯尼的《米老鼠和唐老鸭》里，我最欣赏的是唐老鸭和两个小松鼠，这几个小动物的性格和动态用滑稽手法表现得十分鲜明。捷克的《小鼹鼠的故事》和《好兵帅克》（木偶片）都有这种艺术特色。我国的动画中，像阿达导演韩羽造型的《三个和尚》《超级肥皂》等不很多的片子之外，富于幽默感的作品尚未多见，我感到这是我国动画艺术中最明显的薄弱之点。许多优秀动画片，即使像童话故事《白雪公主》和奇妙的音乐动画《幻想曲》中，也都处处运用幽默艺术手法，情趣盎然，引人入胜。在这次全国动画展播中获大奖和一二等奖的作品都出于漫画家和善于运用幽默技法的人之手，决非偶然。目前动画制作中，这种人才不多，使动画艺术发展受到局限，值得注意。
