China Men's Team Wins East Asian Tennis Team Championship

BEIJING, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) -- The East Asian Tennis Team Championship concluded today in Beijing. In the final day's men's championship match, China's first team defeated South Korea, the three-time defending champions, 2-1 to win the title.

After each team won one singles match, the decisive doubles match came down to a crucial moment. South Korean player Kim Jae-deok was called for two foot faults on his serves. The South Korean coach questioned the line judge's decision and requested a review, which was denied. Without the referee's permission, the South Korean player left the court, forfeiting the match.

    中国男队获东亚网球团体赛冠军
    本报北京10月19日讯　本报记者缪鲁、新华社记者梁金雄报道：东亚网球团体赛今天在此间结束。在最后一天男子冠军争夺战中，中国一队以2∶1战胜连续三届冠军南朝鲜队，获得冠军。
    双方各胜一场单打后，在关键的双打比赛第二盘时，南朝鲜队金载堤两次被判发球踩线。该队教练对司线员的判决表示疑问，要求改判，未允。南朝鲜队员不经裁判长许可，离开赛场，失去继续比赛资格。
