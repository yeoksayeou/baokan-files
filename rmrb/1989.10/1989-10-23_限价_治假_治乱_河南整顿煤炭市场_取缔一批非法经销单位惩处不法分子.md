People's Daily, Zhengzhou, October 22nd. Reporter Li Jie reports: Henan Province has taken measures to regulate and rectify the coal market, implementing price controls, combating fakes, and restoring order, with initial results showing improvement.

Henan is the second-largest coal-producing province in China. Since the fourth quarter of last year, due to various reasons, coal quality has significantly declined, with issues of adulteration and counterfeiting leading to market chaos and soaring prices. This has directly affected industrial and agricultural production as well as the lives of the people. To reverse this situation, early this year, the Henan Provincial Government and relevant cities and prefectures established coal market management and rectification leading groups, comprising departments such as coal, prices, industry and commerce, quality supervision, and public security. These groups collectively addressed issues in coal production, supply, and sales through comprehensive management.

In the production stage, unlicensed mines were shut down. In the circulation sector, management of coal prices and sales was strengthened. For local and township coal mines, maximum prices were set, and unreasonable fees were abolished. A number of illegal sales units were shut down. It is understood that in Jiaozuo City alone, the number of sales units has been reduced from over 300 to 37.

To address the issue of excessive intermediaries and layer-by-layer exploitation in coal trading, Henan Province implemented unified management and sales for coal-producing cities, prefectures, or counties. This ensures the completion of national and provincial allocation plans and promotes market stability. Strict economic penalties were imposed on units and individuals involved in adulteration and counterfeiting.

Currently, after the rectification, the coal market has seen prices stabilize and even decrease, with adulteration and counterfeiting largely curbed. The coal market is gradually stabilizing.

　　限价　治假　治乱
　　河南整顿煤炭市场
　　取缔一批非法经销单位惩处不法分子
    本报郑州10月22日电　记者李杰报道：河南省采取措施治理整顿煤炭市场，限价、治假、治乱三管齐下，初步收到成效。
    河南是我国第二大产煤省。去年第四季度以来，由于种种原因，造成煤炭质量严重下降，掺杂使假，市场混乱，价格猛涨，直接影响了工农业生产和群众的生活。为扭转这种局面，今年初，河南省府和有关地市，相继组成以煤炭、物价、工商、质量监督、公安等部门参加的煤炭市场管理和整顿领导小组，对煤炭产、供、销中出现的问题，集体办公，综合治理。在煤炭生产环节，关闭了无证开采的矿井。在流通领域，加强了对煤炭价格和经销的管理，对地方煤矿和乡镇煤矿规定了最高价、取消不合理费用，取缔了一批非法经销单位。据了解，仅焦作市，经销单位已从300多家减少到37家。
    为解决煤炭经营中间环节过多、层层盘剥问题，河南省以产煤市、地或县为单位，实行统一管理和统一对外经销，确保国家和省调拨计划的完成，促进了煤炭市场的稳定。对掺杂使假的单位和不法分子，进行了严厉的经济制裁。
    目前，经过整顿的煤炭市场，价格稳中有降，掺杂使假现象基本刹住，煤炭市场日趋稳定。
