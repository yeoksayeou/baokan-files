The Supreme Court of the Philippines announced on the 27th a final ruling, upholding President Corazon Aquino's decision to prohibit the return of the remains of former President Ferdinand Marcos for burial in the country. Chief Justice Marcelo B. Fernandez said that the Supreme Court, with a vote of eight to seven, rejected the petition submitted by Marcos' lawyers on October 2nd, which requested permission for the return of Marcos' remains and his family to their homeland. The court's ruling stated that allowing Marcos' remains to return would pose a threat to the stability of the government.

President Corazon Aquino welcomed the court's decision. Senate President Salvador Laurel believed that the Supreme Court's ruling would finally resolve the issue of Marcos' burial. However, Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel expressed regret over the Supreme Court's decision. Laurel has consistently advocated for the return of former President Marcos' remains for burial in the Philippines.

　　菲禁止马科斯遗体回国安葬
    菲律宾最高法院二十七日宣布了一项终审判决，确认科·阿基诺总统的决定，禁止前总统马科斯的遗体回国安葬。最高法院首席法官费尔南说，最高法院以八比七的票数否决了马科斯的律师于十月二日递交的要求法院允许马科斯的遗体及马科斯的亲属返回故里的请求书。法院的裁决书认为，马科斯遗体回国安葬将会威胁到政府的稳定。
    科·阿基诺总统对法院的判决表示欢迎。参议院主席萨隆加认为，最高法院的判决将最终使马科斯遗体安葬问题得到解决。但是菲律宾副总统劳雷尔对最高法院的判决表示遗憾。劳雷尔一直主张前总统马科斯的遗体回国安葬。
