People's Daily, New York, October 19th.

On October 17th, a strong earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area. The Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco has been deeply concerned about the safety of Chinese students in the area. On the 18th, after the power and telephone services were restored, the Education Section of the Consulate immediately contacted various Chinese student and scholar associations at different universities in the Bay Area, as well as some individual students, to express their warm regards and concern.

It has been confirmed that all over 40 Chinese students at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are safe and sound. The Consulate has informed relevant domestic agencies about their safety to alleviate the worries of their families. Students at Stanford University, San Jose State University, Santa Clara University, and the University of California, Hayward, which are closer to the earthquake's epicenter, are also safe and unharmed.

　　旧金山我留学人员安全无恙
    本报纽约10月19日电　10月17日旧金山湾区发生强烈地震后，我驻旧金山总领事馆对该地区我留学人员的安全十分关切。18日领馆供电及电话恢复后，教育组即分途与湾区各校我中国留学生、学者联谊会及一些留学人员联系，并表示亲切慰问。
    经了解，加州大学圣克鲁斯分校的40多名我留学人员全部安然无恙，我旧金山总领事馆已将其安全情况告知国内有关单位，以免他们的家人惦念。距地震中心较近的圣荷西斯坦福大学和圣克拉拉、加州大学海沃尔分校等校的留学人员均平安无事。
