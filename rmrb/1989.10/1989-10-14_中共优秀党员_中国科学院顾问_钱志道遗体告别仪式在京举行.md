The farewell ceremony for Comrade Qian Zhidao, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China and a loyal communist warrior who has been tested by time, was held today at the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery in Beijing.

Comrade Qian Zhidao was an advisor to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a member of the academy, and formerly the vice president of the University of Science and Technology of China and the vice director of the Graduate School of the University of Science and Technology of China. He passed away in Beijing on September 28, 1989, at the age of 79 due to illness.

Qian Zhidao was from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He graduated from the Chemistry Department of Zhejiang University in 1935. In his youth, he pursued truth and progress. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, he believed that the hope of China lay with the Communist Party of China, and he wrote to Chairman Mao Zedong to recommend himself. In May 1938, he arrived in Yan'an and joined the Communist Party of China in January 1941. After arriving in Yan'an, Qian Zhidao successively served as the engineer of the Military Commission's Military Industry Bureau, the director of the Third Factory of the Cha Fang Crafts Practice Factory, and the chief engineer of the Zifanggou Chemical Factory. Due to his outstanding achievements, in 1944, he was awarded the title of "Special Labor Hero" by the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong personally inscribed the words "Eager to Create" for him. In 1945, he was again awarded the title of Labor Hero of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region and was praised as the founder of the basic chemical industry in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region.

During the War of Liberation, Comrade Qian Zhidao served as the engineer of the Military Industry Department of the Northeast, overseeing the construction of the Mishan Smokeless Powder Factory, and served as the factory director and political commissar. Later, he served as the deputy director of the Military Industry Bureau of the Northeast and a candidate member of the Northeast People's Government Committee. He made important contributions to the establishment of military industry production in the Northeast and to the victory of the War of Liberation.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, he successively served as the deputy director of the Military Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the assistant minister of the Second Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the deputy director of the Mechanical Group of the State Council's Science Planning Commission, the director of the Missile Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, the deputy director of the Instrument Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the engineer of the Third Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, and the deputy director of the Technical Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He made important contributions to the development of China's national defense science and technology.

During his time at the University of Science and Technology of China and the Graduate School of the University of Science and Technology of China, Comrade Qian Zhidao emphasized the comprehensive implementation of the Party's educational policies, had a rigorous and meticulous attitude towards scholarship, and was respected and loved by teachers and students. During the ten years of turmoil, Qian Zhidao was persecuted by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique, but he always believed in the Party and the people. After the Gang of Four was smashed, he was elected as a representative to the Eleventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Comrade Qian Zhidao devoted himself to the people for more than half a century. As a senior intellectual, he had a strong sense of party spirit, and for decades, he wholeheartedly worked for the Party. Under any difficult and harsh conditions, he never slackened or wavered, which is extremely rare and precious.

    徐向前、伍修权、张爱萍、周光召、钱三强、谷超豪等送了花圈。严济慈以及和钱志道同志一同生活战斗多年的李强、沈鸿、贝时璋等参加了遗体告别仪式。
    钱志道是浙江绍兴人，1935年毕业于浙江大学化学系。他在青年时代即追求真理，要求进步。抗日战争爆发后，他认定中国的希望在中国共产党，便给毛泽东主席写信自荐，并于1938年5月到达延安，1941年1月加入了中国共产党。到延安后，钱志道先后担任中央军委军工局工程师、茶坊工艺实习厂三厂厂长、紫芳沟化学厂总工程师等职。由于功绩卓著，1944年他被陕甘宁边区政府授予“特等劳动英雄”称号，毛泽东主席还为他亲笔题词“热心创造”。1945年他再次获边区劳动英雄称号，并被誉为陕甘宁边区基本化学工业的奠基人。
    解放战争期间，钱志道同志担任东北军工部工程师，负责主持兴建密山无烟药厂，并任厂长兼政委。而后，他任东北军工局副局长、东北人民政府委员会候补委员。他对建立东北军工生产和为夺取解放战争的胜利作出了重要贡献。
    新中国成立之后，他历任重工业部军工总局副局长、第二机械工业部部长助理、国务院科学规划委员会机械组副组长、第一机械工业部导弹部总局局长、中国科学技术委员会仪器组副组长、第三机械工业部工程师、中国科学院技术学部副主任。为发展我国的国防科学技术事业作出了重要贡献。
    钱志道同志在中国科技大学、中国科技大学研究生院工作期间，重视全面贯彻党的教育方针，治学态度严谨细致，受到师生员工的崇敬和爱戴。十年动乱期间，钱志道受到林彪、江青反革命集团的迫害，但他始终相信党和人民。粉碎“四人帮”后，他又当选为中国共产党第十一次全国代表大会的代表。
    钱志道同志为人民英勇奋斗了半个多世纪，作为一个高级知识分子，他具有坚强的党性，数十年如一日，全心全意地为党工作，在任何艰难困苦的条件下，从不松懈动摇，这是极其难能可贵的。
