Yunnan's local and railway public security departments recently announced the bust of a major case involving the trafficking of cultural relics.

The level and quantity of the seized artifacts in this case are unprecedented in Yunnan's 40-year history of handling such cases. A total of 10,821 items were seized, including one national first-class relic, a gilded "Ajita" standing Buddha statue from the Dali Kingdom period of the Song Dynasty. Among the second-class relics are a Tang Dynasty sea creature grape mirror, a Warring States period gilded jade-green agate belt hook, and three gold and silver flat-separated belt hooks. There are also 93 third-class relics.

These artifacts are witnesses to Yunnan's historical development and cultural heritage. The public security departments will hand them over to Yunnan's cultural relics department for preservation according to national regulations, ensuring their "return to their rightful owner."

This case was jointly investigated and solved by the Kunming Public Security Bureau and the Railway Public Security Bureau. Five suspects from within and outside the province involved in the trafficking of cultural relics have been apprehended.
