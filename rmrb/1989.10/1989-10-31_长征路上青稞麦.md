This October marks the 55th anniversary of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's departure from the Jiangxi Soviet base area and the beginning of their strategic retreat. The outstanding sons and daughters of China, with their two iron feet, marched 25,000 li, traversing 11 provinces, erecting "a monument to human determination and fearlessness that will forever be passed down through the ages." (_The Long March: An Unprecedented Story_)

Aircraft in the sky, pursuers on the ground, snow-capped mountains and grasslands, wind and rain for sustenance, even digging wild vegetables, gnawing on tree bark, and boiling leather straps. Yet, our soldiers marched on, their spirits unbroken: "After traveling ten thousand miles, their bodies remained strong, and after enduring a thousand hardships, their courage remained unshaken."

What was particularly moving was the arduous scene of procuring food and harvesting crops as they passed through Tibetan areas. In July 1935, after 10 months of relentless battles, the Central Red Army crossed the Wujiang River, occupied Zunyi, forced their way across the Jinsha River, and swiftly advanced to the Black Water and Luhua areas of northwestern Sichuan. This was a remote Tibetan region with treacherous terrain, sparse population, and ethnic and linguistic barriers, making it extremely difficult for the Red Army to secure supplies. They had no choice but to mobilize the entire army to procure food. Deng Yingchao once recalled: "When we reached the largest Tibetan village, Maergai, there were many fields of green barley. Green barley is the staple food of the locals, but it had not yet ripened. To continue fighting and solve the food problem, the Red Army had to decide to harvest the unripe green barley of the Tibetans and then insert wooden signs in the fields, writing down the quantity of the barley as evidence for future settlement with the Red Army. We first roasted the unripe green barley to dry it, then used wooden boards or bricks to remove the husks, extracting the grains, and cooked them to eat. Everyone worked enthusiastically, dividing into groups to see who could do more and faster. This harvest involved everyone from Chairman Mao down to the cooks, even Comrades Bo, Lin, Xu, and Xie. It was a scene of great enthusiasm, with songs and laughter filling the air."

Green barley is said to be hard, coarse, difficult to swallow, and hard to digest. Moreover, unripe green barley, roasted, rubbed, and winnowed, often mixed with stalks and husks, making it a mouthful of bristles when cooked and eaten. According to _The Long March_, each soldier carried a few pounds of roasted green barley or green barley flour, which, when soaked in rainwater, turned into a sticky mass, clumping together. Roasted green barley was even worse; when soaked in water, it became like rubber, making it difficult to chew and swallow.

Despite these hardships, to survive and fight, comrades did not turn away from anything, truly embodying the spirit of "when hungry, even chaff tastes sweet." The rest and recuperation unit had such an amusing incident: the roasted green barley turned black, staining the mouths of those who ate it. Whether men or women, they all looked like they had grown a circle of beard. Everyone opened their black mouths, showing their white teeth, laughing at each other, calling each other "black crows" and "black beards," full of joy and optimism!

Although small and coarse, green barley played a significant role in the revolution. Thanks to it, the Red Army was able to continue fighting and reach the victorious end of the Long March. Through it, the unity, camaraderie, and shared hardships within the revolutionary ranks were also demonstrated, as well as the immense spiritual power derived from it. For example, the 58-year-old "old man" platoon leader, Xu Telie, was the oldest in the cadre rest and recuperation unit, but he was the most caring, considerate, and helpful. He voluntarily gave his meager supply of green barley to his old comrade Xie Jueyuan. Xie, recalling this experience, wrote with great emotion: "I am six years younger than Comrade Xu. During marches and camping, it was often he who took care of me. That time crossing the grasslands, when we set out, due to the extreme difficulty in procuring food, the organization could only issue a few pounds of roasted green barley to each comrade. Before we had even left the grasslands, my rations were finished. Unfortunately, I was also ill, my body very weak. When Comrade Xu learned of my situation, he immediately poured out all his saved rations to me. I was moved to tears." For this, Xie also wrote a poem: "In the vast marshes and towering frozen hills, who all tied their stomachs, giving me their entire pockets."

Another comrade who experienced the hardships of green barley on the Long March was Lu Dingyi. He not only mentioned this in the _Long March Song_ he co-wrote with Jia Tuofu in October 1935 in Wuzhi Town, Shaanbei, but also, half a century later, wrote down these lyrics with great emotion when inscribing the _Long March Song_:

In July, we entered northwestern Sichuan, Black Water, Luhua, and green barley;
Through hardship and struggle for what?
For the new China of the people.

　　长征路上青稞麦

    今年10月是中国工农红军告别江西革命根据地进入战略大转移的55周年。中华优秀儿女用自己的两只铁脚板，长驱25000里，纵横11省，树起了“人类坚定无畏的丰碑，永远流传于世”。（《长征——前所未闻的故事》）
    天上飞机，地下追兵，雪山草地，风餐露宿，甚至挖野菜，啃树皮，煮皮带，而我们的战士则铁骨铮铮地“行程万里身犹健，历尽千辛胆未寒”。
    尤为感动人的是通过藏族地区时筹粮收麦的艰难情景。1935年7月间，中央红军经过10个月的日夜鏖战，过乌江，占遵义，强渡金沙江，飞夺泸定桥，17勇士跨越天险大渡河，快速挺进到川西北的黑水、芦花一带。这里是与世隔绝的藏族地区，地形险要，人烟稀少，加上民族隔阂，语言不通，致使红军给养遇到了极大困难，不得不动员全军去筹粮。邓颖超就曾这样回忆道：到藏族最大的村子——毛儿盖时，那里的青稞麦田很多。青稞麦是当地人的主食，但尚未成熟。红军为了继续战斗，解决吃的困难，不得已决定收割藏族尚未成熟的青稞麦，然后在田里插上木牌子，写上麦子的数量，作为将来向红军清帐的证据。我们先将未成熟的青稞用火烤干，再用木板或砖头搓去壳，脱出麦粒，煮着吃。大家干得很起劲，分成若干份，看谁干得多，干得快。这次收麦，上至毛主席，下至炊事员，甚至董老、林老、徐老、谢老都参加了，真是热火朝天，干劲十足，歌声四起，笑语遍野。
    青稞麦，据说坚硬，粗糙，难咽，不易消化。加上未成熟的青稞麦，光靠烘烤、揉搓和扬簸，麦秆、糠皮常常混杂在一起，水煮后一吃，满嘴是芒刺。据《红军长征记》一书讲，战士每人背着几斤炒熟的青稞或青稞粉，经雨水一淋，变成了磁团，结成一疙瘩。炒青稞更糟糕，被水淹后如同橡皮胶一样，牙齿弄疲，也吃不下四两。
    尽管这样，为了生存，为了战斗，同志们什么都不嫌弃，真叫“饿了糠也甜”。干部休养连就有这样的趣事：烤过的青稞，变得焦黑，送进嘴里，把嘴巴周围都染黑了，无论男女都像长了一圈胡子。大家张开黑乎乎的嘴巴，露出雪白的牙齿，相视而笑，各指着对方喊“黑乌鸦”、“黑胡子”，好不开心，好不乐观啊！
    青稞麦虽小虽粗，却为革命立了大功。靠了它，红军才能坚持奋战，长征才能达到胜利的终点。同时，通过它，也表现出革命队伍里团结友爱、亲密无间、患难与共的同志关系以及由此引发出的巨大精神力量。譬如，干部连58岁的
  “老头”班长徐特立，年岁最大，而最能关心人，体贴人，帮助人，他竟将自己仅有的一点青稞麦主动让给老伙伴谢觉哉。谢老在回忆这段经历时，十分激动地写下这样一段文字：“我比徐老小六岁，行军啦，宿营啦，却总是他照顾我的时候多。那次过草地，出发的时候，因为筹粮实在困难，组织上只给每个同志发了几斤焙干了的青稞麦。还没走出草地，我的干粮就完了。不巧我又在害病，身体也十分虚弱。当徐老知道我的情况后，他就毫不犹豫地将自己忍饥节省下来的干粮全部倒给我。我感动地流下了泪。”为了这，谢老还欣然赋诗一首：“漠漠沮洳地，峨峨暴冻岗。是谁皆束腹，赠我竟倾囊。”
    同在长征路上饱尝过青稞麦滋味的陆定一，也没有忘记这段难忘的历史。他不仅于1935年10月在陕北吴起镇与贾托夫合写《长征歌》时谈到此事，而且在相隔半个世纪后题写《长征歌》时又饱蘸笔墨地录下这段歌词：
    七月进入川西北，黑水芦花青稞麦；艰苦奋斗为哪个，为了人民新中国。
