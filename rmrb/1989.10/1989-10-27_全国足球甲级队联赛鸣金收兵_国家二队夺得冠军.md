The 1989 National Football League A Group championship, which lasted for four months, concluded today after 56 matches in Nanjing and Hefei.

The young and energetic National Second Team, with 14 matches resulting in 9 wins, 4 draws, and 1 loss, accumulated 31 points, securing the top position and claiming the championship. Liaoning Team, with 28 points, came in second. Shanghai Team ranked third. The teams in fourth to sixth places are, in order, the PLA Team, Tianjin Team, and Guangdong Team. Shandong Team and Guangzhou Team, with the lowest points, will be demoted to the B Group next year.

In today's final round, Shanghai Team lost 2-3 to Guangdong Team, Shandong Team drew 0-0 with Tianjin Team, the National Second Team defeated Liaoning Team 3-1, and the PLA Team drew 1-1 with Guangzhou Team.

This year's A Group league had distinct features. With the division into A and B Groups, the eight teams in the A Group had relatively balanced strength, and each team performed to their potential, showing varying degrees of improvement compared to last year's league. The number of spectators also increased compared to last year. Some veteran players remained in top form, playing crucial roles. In terms of technique, the teams emphasized technical skills and overall teamwork, with faster progression, tighter defense, and a higher shooting success rate than in previous years. However, the matches revealed issues such as the need for improved goalkeeper skills, a shortage of reserve talents, slow transitions between attack and defense, and inadequate physical training, all of which require improvement in the future.

The 12 teams in the B Group of the National Football League concluded their matches on October 25 in the Dalian and Nanning regions. Henan Team and Dalian Team secured the top two positions. According to the competition rules, these two teams will be promoted to the A Group for next year's National Football League A Group matches. Hunan Team and Tianjin Port Team, with the lowest points, will be demoted to the second division.

　　全国足球甲级队联赛鸣金收兵
　　国家二队夺得冠军
    本报南京10月26日电　历时4个月的1989年全国足球甲级队联赛A组比赛，经过56场争夺，今天在南京、合肥两地排定座次。
    年轻气盛的国家二队以14战9胜4平1负，积31分，居各队之首，登上冠军宝座。辽宁队积28分，屈居其次。上海队列第三名。第四至第六名的队依次是八一队、天津队、广东队。山东队和广州队的积分排列A组榜尾，明年降入B组行列。
    在今日最后一轮比赛中，上海队以2∶3败给广东队，山东队0∶0踢平天津队，国二3∶1胜辽宁队，八一队1∶1平广州队。
    今年甲级队联赛特点显著。由于分为A、B组，A组八强实力相当，各队基本发挥了水平，不同程度地比去年联赛有进步，观众也比去年多。一些老将仍宝刀不老，起到了重要的作用。在技术方面，各队较讲究技术和注意整体作战能力，推进速度快，防守严密，射门成功率高于往年。然而，比赛中暴露出守门员水平亟待提高和后备人才匮乏、攻防转换缓慢、身体训练水平不足的问题，有待于今后改善。

    又讯　全国足球甲级队联赛B组的12支球队，25日分别在大连和南宁赛区结束了赛事。河南队和大连队的积分排在前两名。按照竞赛规程，这两个队将晋升A组，参加明年全国甲级队联赛A组的比赛。湖南队和天津港集队积分最少，降为乙级队。
