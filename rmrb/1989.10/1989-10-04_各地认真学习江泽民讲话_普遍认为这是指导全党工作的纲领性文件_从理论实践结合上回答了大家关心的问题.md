Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 3rd.

The important speech given by Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, has sparked enthusiastic responses across various sectors of the country. Many factories, schools, government agencies, and neighborhood committees have organized study sessions and discussions. People generally believe that Jiang Zemin's speech is a guiding document for the current work of the entire Party. It is of great significance in uniting the people of the whole country to achieve greater victories in socialist modernization and reform.

Over the past few days, Party committees in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have held meetings to study Jiang Zemin's speech. The CPC Beijing Municipal Committee held an expanded meeting of its standing committee on September 29 to discuss Jiang Zemin's speech. Attendees believed that Jiang Zemin's report is a guiding document for unifying the Party's thoughts and guiding future work. They thought that Jiang Zemin's report emphasized the need to be vigilant against and prevent "peaceful evolution," a major issue concerning China's future and destiny. It has both real-time relevance and profound historical significance. The standing committee members deeply felt that to prevent "peaceful evolution," one must strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party; two, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; three, adhere to public ownership; four, strengthen military construction; and five, currently, it is essential to thoroughly investigate and clean up.

Ruxuezheng, a standing committee member and political and legal secretary of the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee, said while studying Jiang Zemin's speech, "This speech is the first comprehensive exposition of our Party's domestic and foreign policies after the turmoil. It answers the urgent questions of the entire Party and the people of the whole country from the perspective of combining theory with practice. In the four basic conclusions, especially the reasons for walking the socialist path and not the capitalist path; why we must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party and not be led by any other party, these two points are explained thoroughly, making the entire Party and the people of the whole country more clearly understand the direction of advancement and firm up their confidence in adhering to one central task and two basic points."

On September 29, after watching Jiang Zemin's speech, the standing committee of the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee immediately held a discussion. The standing committee members believed that in recent years, bourgeois liberalization thoughts have spread, confusing many of our Party's basic theories and losing many of our "family treasures." Jiang Zemin used the perspective of dialectical and historical materialism to scientifically summarize the past and look forward to the future. This speech clearly explained a series of major issues both inside and outside the Party, both domestically and internationally, such as construction and reform, domestic and foreign affairs, the present and the future. It embodies the Party's theoretical and line's firmness, clarity, and continuity, and has a clear and targeted solution to real problems. The Hubei Provincial Committee's standing committee proposed requirements on how to organize Party members and cadres, especially county-level and above leaders, to study this speech well.

Yang Ruidai, Secretary of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee, said during the study, "Jiang Zemin's speech is strong in ideology, policy, and target, and is a guiding document for fully adhering to the Party's basic line of one central task and two basic points. It is the governing program of the third-generation leadership collective of the Party."

The Sichuan Provincial Committee's standing committee decided to immediately issue a notice in the name of the Provincial Committee, requiring county-level and above leading cadres across the province to organize the study of Jiang Zemin's important speech. The study should achieve three "combinations": combining with the study of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Deng Xiaoping's three important speeches; combining with solving current ideological recognition problems among the masses; and combining with implementing and carrying out the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee that need to be focused on currently.

On the afternoon of September 29, the leading members of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference, Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Government, and Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference gathered to watch the live broadcast of Jiang Zemin's speech. Provincial Committee Secretary Lin Ruo said, "Jiang Zemin's speech comprehensively and systematically expounded the Party's policies and principles from ten aspects, including adhering to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up. This is of great significance for improving and unifying the ideological recognition of a wide range of cadres and the masses, for doing a good job in rectification and rectification work, and for better adhering to the Party's basic line of one central task and two basic points, and for building socialist modernization. The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee decided that day that all departments, units, and Party committees at all levels across the province should organize a wide range of cadres and the masses to study Jiang Zemin's important speech, deeply understand its spirit and essence, and strive to implement it in the current work.

Jiang Zemin's speech has sparked a strong response among a wide range of cadres, the masses, and intellectuals. Many cadres, the masses, and intellectuals studied the speech carefully during the holiday.

Liu Yuxiu, the head of the finishing department of the Beijing Third Cotton Mill, said, "After listening to Jiang Zemin's speech, I was very inspired and felt that socialism has a future, and the motherland has hope." Chen Zengmin, the Party secretary of the Beijing Third Cotton Mill, said, "For a long time, everyone has said that the Chinese people have lost their spiritual pillar. I think the four basic conclusions summarized by Jiang Zemin are our spiritual pillar. The core issue is adhering to the socialist path and the leadership of the Party." Researchers such as Chen Bohai from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences believe that Jiang Zemin's speech on the unity of the two basic points is very thorough. We must adhere to reform and opening up and must adhere to the four cardinal principles; the two are indispensable. The self-improvement of the socialist system needs reform and opening up, and reform and opening up must adhere to the socialist direction. Professor Wong Shih-lieh, the president of Shanghai Jiaotong University, believes that Jiang Zemin's speech has clarified the confusion in several major political policies, institutional reforms, and theoretical issues over the past few years. The speech also repeatedly mentioned the issue of education and the Party's policy on intellectuals, placing education in its proper position. After reading it, I deeply feel that the responsibility and task of education are heavy, the direction is clear. We should strive to work for the cultivation of red and expert socialist successors.

Li Jinqun, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Tianjin University, said, "In the speech, Jiang Zemin discussed ten issues for future work, especially several economic issues, clarifying the confusion in planned economy and market regulation, public ownership and various economic components, distribution according to work and social distribution inequality, and agriculture as the foundation. It pointed out the direction for the advancement of socialism with Chinese characteristics. I believe that by following this path, our country's economy will be able to overcome temporary difficulties and enter a stable and developing virtuous cycle."

After carefully studying Jiang Zemin's important speech, members of the Party group of the Hubei Provincial Planning Commission linked it to their actual work and proposed to unify the guiding ideology of economic work with Jiang Zemin's speech. They believe that at present, the tendency to weaken the planned economy and engage in localism is quite serious in various places, and the randomness in formulating plans is very large, and the implementation of plans is not serious. They emphasized the need to strengthen the guiding role of planning.

After watching Jiang Zemin's National Day speech, Zhao Xiyou, general manager of Shenyang Jinbei Automobile Stock Co., Ltd., a national labor model, said, "This speech reflects the voice of the people of the whole country. Jiang Zemin mentioned that the reform pilot projects that have been determined should continue, dispelling our doubts about further reform and opening up, and firming up our confidence in boldly exploring and deepening enterprise reform."

At the national day symposium held by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee and Provincial Government, Hu Cai, chairman of the Provincial Federation of Literature and Art Circles and the Writers' Association, said, "Jiang Zemin's speech shines with the brilliance of Marxism. This shows that in the 40 years of construction, we have not only accumulated rich material wealth but also precious spiritual wealth, thought, and theoretical wealth. Looking ahead, it makes us more full of confidence in victory."

    中共天津市委常委、政法书记鲁学政在学习江泽民的讲话时说，这个讲话是动乱以后第一次全面阐述我们党的对内对外政策，从理论和实践的结合上回答了全党和全国人民亟待回答的问题。在四条基本结论中，尤其是为什么要走社会主义道路，不能走资本主义道路；为什么要坚持共产党的领导，不能由别的什么党来领导这两条讲得透彻，使全党和全国人民更加明确了前进的方向，坚定了坚持一个中心、两个基本点的信心。
    中共湖北省委常委9月29日收看了江泽民同志的讲话后，立即进行了讨论。常委们认为，近几年来资产阶级自由化思想泛滥，把我们党好多基本理论搞乱了，把很多“传家宝”丢掉了。江泽民同志运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点，科学地总结了过去，展望了未来。这个讲话把建设与改革、内政与外交、现在和将来等一系列党内外、国内外关心的重大问题，都讲清楚了，既体现了党的理论、路线的坚定性、明确性和连续性，又有解决现实问题的鲜明针对性。湖北省委常委就如何组织全省党员干部、特别是县以上领导干部学好这个讲话提出了要求。

    9月29日下午，中共广东省委、省顾委、省纪委和广东省人大、省政府、省政协领导成员，集中收看了江泽民同志讲话的电视实况转播。省委书记林若说，江泽民同志的讲话从坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放等十个方面，全面、系统地阐述了党的方针、政策，这对于提高和统一广大干部群众的思想认识，搞好治理整顿工作，对于更好地坚持党的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，搞好社会主义现代化建设，都将产生非常重要的作用。中共广东省委当天决定，全省各部门、各单位和各级党委，都要认真组织广大干部群众学习江泽民同志的重要讲话，深入领会其精神实质，努力贯彻到当前的各项工作中去。
