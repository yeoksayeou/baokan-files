Li Peng Meets with Guests of the International Symposium on Government Administrative Reform, Says China Has Much Work to Do in Institutional Reform

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 17th — Premier Li Peng today met with senior officials, experts, and scholars from 14 countries and international organizations attending the International Symposium on Government Administrative Reform at the Zhongnanhai Purple Light Pavilion.

Li Peng said holding such a symposium is excellent, as it helps Chinese and foreign experts exchange experiences and learn from each other. He wished the conference a complete success.

Li Peng, in his speech, introduced China's institutional reform and the current situation to the guests. He said, "We will continue to implement the reform and opening-up policy and, according to the progress of economic and political system reforms, carry out institutional reforms in a step-by-step manner. The institutional reforms we have carried out over the past year have achieved some results, but they are not enough. Institutional reform is a relatively long process, and we still have a lot of work to do."

Li Peng emphasized that China's reform is not heading towards a completely market-oriented economy, nor is it to turn public ownership into private ownership. Instead, it is a combination of planned economy and market regulation. This is an important principle of the reform.

When talking about the current situation, Li Peng said, "In early June this year, we suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing. Currently, our political situation is stable, and the Party Central Committee and the State Council can effectively and normally exercise their powers nationwide. Friends can see from their personal experiences that Beijing is peaceful, and the order is normal."

Carlos Almaraz, Secretary-General of the International Institute of Administrative Sciences, on behalf of the foreign guests, said that the holding of this conference shows that China's reform and opening-up policy is consistent. China is willing to exchange information and experiences on administrative management reform with other countries. Administrative management reform is necessary for both developed and developing countries, and mutual learning in this regard is beneficial. They wish China's reform to succeed.

Secretary-General of the State Council, Luo Gan, and Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Zhao Dongman, attended the meeting.

    李鹏会见政府行政管理改革国际研讨会客人时说
    我国机构改革还有许多工作要做
    新华社北京10月17日电　国务院总理李鹏今天在中南海紫光阁会见了参加政府行政管理改革国际研讨会的14个国家和国际组织的高级官员、专家和学者。
    李鹏说，召开这样的研讨会很好，有助于中外专家交流经验，互相借鉴。他预祝会议圆满成功。
    李鹏在讲话中向客人们介绍了我国机构改革和当前的形势。他说，我们将一如既往地执行改革开放政策，并根据经济、政治体制改革的进程，有步骤地进行机构改革。去年以来，我们所进行的机构改革已经取得了一定成效，但是还不够。机构改革是一个比较长的过程，我们还有许多工作要做。
    李鹏强调，中国的改革不是走向完全的市场经济，也不是要把公有制变成私有制，而是计划经济和市场调节相结合。这是改革的一条重要原则。
    在谈到当前形势时，李鹏说，今年6月初，我们平息了发生在北京的反革命暴乱。目前，我们的政局是稳定的，党中央、国务院在全国能够有效地正常地行使自己的职权。朋友们可以从亲身经历中看到，北京气氛平和，秩序正常。
    国际行政科学学会总干事卡洛斯·阿尔马达代表外国客人表示，这次会议的召开表明，中国的改革开放政策是一贯的。中国是愿意和其他国家交流行政管理改革方面的信息和经验。行政管理改革对发达国家和发展中国家都是必要的，在这方面互相借鉴是有益的。他们预祝中国的改革取得成功。
    国务院秘书长罗干、人事部部长赵东宛等参加了会见。
