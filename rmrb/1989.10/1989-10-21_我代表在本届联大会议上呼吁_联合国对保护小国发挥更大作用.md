People's Daily, United Nations, October 19th - Reporter Liu Kaichen reports: China's representative Yu Shuning today at the special political committee meeting of the current UN General Assembly called for the UN to play a greater role in protecting the security of small nations.

The meeting today discussed the new agenda item "Protection and Security of Small Nations." Yu Shuning, in his speech, expressed that China supports seeking new and effective ways to maintain the security of all nations, especially small nations, and first and foremost, to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of existing international mechanisms.

Yu Shuning pointed out that in international relations, hegemony and power politics still exist. Some conflicts have become more acute due to the destruction of recognized international norms. Bullying the weak, imposing one's will on others, and even using military force to invade other countries' sovereignty and damage their territorial integrity are common occurrences. Especially, small nations, due to various limitations, are more likely to become victims, including attacks by mercenaries, foreign military threats, and invasions. These actions should be unanimously condemned and firmly stopped by the international community.

The chairman of the Special Political Committee, Odovaniko, also expressed condolences at the meeting for the loss of life and property in China due to the earthquake that occurred yesterday.

　　我代表在本届联大会议上呼吁
　　联合国对保护小国发挥更大作用
    本报联合国10月19日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国代表于树宁今天在本届联大特别政治委员会会议上呼吁联合国机构在保护小国安全方面发挥更大的作用。
    会议今天审议“小国的保护和安全”的新议程项目。于树宁在发言中表示中国支持为维护各国安全特别是小国安全寻求新的有效途径，首先要加强和提高现有国际机制的效能。
    于树宁指出，在国际关系中，霸权主义和强权政治依然存在，有些矛盾由于公认的国际关系准则遭到破坏尖锐起来。以大欺小，以强凌弱，把自己的意志强加于人，甚至以武力侵犯别国主权，损害别国领土完整的事件时有发生。特别是小国由于种种限制，更容易成为受害对象，包括雇佣军的袭击、外国的武力威胁和侵略。这些行径应该受到国际社会的一致谴责和坚决制止。
    特别政治委员会主席奥多万柯还在会上对中国昨天发生地震遭受生命财产损失表示慰问。
