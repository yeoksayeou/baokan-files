Reclaiming Deserts, Building Irrigation Canals, Constructing Railways, Establishing Factories:
The Contributions of Troops Stationed in Xinjiang to Border Development are Great

People's Daily reports: Along with the advancement of the Republic, the vast land of Xinjiang, which accounts for one-sixth of the country's area, has undergone tremendous changes. As the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the 34th anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region, they highly praise the significant contributions made by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang to the construction of the western border of the motherland.

As early as the 1950s, the first troops of the First Army Corps, led by General Wang Zhen, marched into the deserts and grasslands of the Tian Shan Mountains, launching a massive production movement. In three years, they reclaimed over 1.6 million mu of land and harvested more than 340 million jin of grain. Subsequently, 10 agricultural construction divisions established nearly 30 large and medium-sized factories and mines, including the July 1st Cotton Textile Mill, the October Automobile Repair Factory, and the August 1st Steel Plant, laying the foundation for the modernization of Xinjiang's industry.

Before the founding of New China, Xinjiang had only about 2,000 kilometers of gravel roads that could barely maintain traffic. Starting from 1953, the troops stationed in Xinjiang, together with road construction workers, opened up battlefields in the vast deserts and icy peaks where birds rarely fly, launching a campaign to develop Xinjiang's modern transportation. They successively built the Tian Shan Highway, the Sino-Pakistan Highway, the Urumqi-Kuqa Highway, the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the Southern Xinjiang Railway, and more than a hundred major transportation arteries. On the eve of the 40th anniversary of liberation, another major artery in northern Xinjiang—the Northern Xinjiang Railway—was laid with tracks to Jinghe with the support of more than 10,000 soldiers stationed in Xinjiang. Over the past 40 years, the troops stationed in Xinjiang have built 3,100 kilometers of main and branch irrigation canals for the various ethnic groups, expanding and improving the irrigation area by 2.4 million mu. Irrigation projects named "Military-Civilian Unity Canal" and "Love the People Canal" are scattered throughout the Tian Shan Mountains. In recent years, the troops have also voluntarily dug wells for the people, 805 in total, and laid 40,000 meters of water pipes. The once-desolate wasteland, which foreign explorers exclaimed as the "Sea of Death," is now a "Sea of Life" with flowing canals, herds of cattle and sheep, rows of trees, and abundant crops.

The troops stationed in Xinjiang have also taken promoting the common prosperity of all ethnic groups as an important part of supporting the economic construction of the border region, carrying out various forms of poverty alleviation and relief activities. According to incomplete statistics, the troops in the entire region have organized more than 50,000 poverty alleviation service teams, assisted in the establishment of more than 2,000 economic entities, and helped more than 80,000 impoverished households to become prosperous.

    垦荒漠　修干渠　筑铁路　建工厂
    驻疆部队建设边塞贡献大
    本报讯　伴随着共和国的前进步伐，占祖国1／6面积的新疆大地发生了翻天覆地的变化。新疆各族人民在欢庆建国40周年和自治区成立34周年时，高度赞扬驻新疆解放军为建设祖国西部边塞所作出的重大贡献。
    早在50年代初，刚刚进驻新疆的解放军第一兵团部队，由王震将军率领，开进天山南北的荒漠草原，开展了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动，3年垦地160多万亩，收获粮食3.4亿多斤。以后10个农垦师，又陆续建成了七一棉纺织厂、十月汽车修配厂、八一钢铁厂等近30个大中型厂矿企业，为建设新疆现代化工业打下了基础。
    新中国成立前，新疆境内仅有2000多公里砂石路勉强维持通车。从1953年起，驻疆部队与筑路工人一道在浩瀚无垠的戈壁沙漠和飞鸟罕至的冰峰雪岭摆开战场，打响了发展新疆现代化交通事业的战斗。先后建成天山公路、中巴公路、乌库公路、新藏公路和兰新铁路、南疆铁路等上百条主要交通干线。解放40周年前夕，新疆又一条大动脉——北疆铁路，在驻疆部队万余官兵的支援下，铺轨至精河。40年来，驻疆部队为各族人民修建引水干渠、斗渠3100余公里，扩大和改善灌溉面积240万亩。以“军民团结渠”、“爱民渠”等命名的引水工程遍布天山南北。近几年来，部队还义务为群众打井805眼，铺设自来水管道4万多米。昔日被国外探险家惊呼为“死亡之海”的万古荒原，如今渠水淙淙，牛羊成群，林带纵横，稼禾盈畴，成了“生命的海洋”。
    驻疆部队还把促进各民族的共同繁荣
  当作支援边疆经济建设的重要内容，开展了多种形式的扶贫济困活动。据不完全统计，全区部队共组织各类扶贫服务小组5万多个，助办经济实体2000多个，使8万多穷困户脱贫致富。（杨功成　马林华）
