Sichuan Allocates Funds to Support the Small Jin Earthquake Zone

According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on October 4th, (reporter Chen Xie) after the 6.6 magnitude earthquake in Small Jin County, Sichuan Province, the provincial government, despite facing continuous natural disasters and financial strain this year, allocated 1.7 million yuan to support the disaster area in resuming production and rebuilding homes. Additionally, it sent 4,800 rolls of tarpaulin, 1,000 sets of cotton clothing, 5 tons each of nails and wire, 200 tons of fertilizer, and 100 tons of oil.

Small Jin County, located at an altitude of over 3,000 meters, is classified as an old, minority, border, and impoverished region. Although no one died in this earthquake, the county still faces many challenges in resuming production and rebuilding homes.

    四川拨款支援小金震区
    据新华社成都10月4日电　（记者陈燮）四川省小金县发生6.6级地震后，省政府在今年连续遭受自然灾害，财政紧张的情况下，拨款170万元，支持灾区恢复生产，重建家园。同时，调去油毡4800卷，棉衣裤1000套，圆钉、铁丝各5吨、化肥200吨和油料100吨。
    位于海拔3000米以上的小金县，属老、少、边、穷地区。这次地震，全县无人员死亡，但在恢复生产、重建家园方面仍面临很多困难。
