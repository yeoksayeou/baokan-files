The works reflect the bravery and sacrifices made by the "Second Field Army," led by Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, in their struggles for national liberation during the war years. They also depict the army's efforts to learn scientific and cultural knowledge during the period of defending the country and building peace, as well as their contributions to guarding the borders and serving the people. Most of the authors are veterans of the "Second Field Army."

　　《刘邓大军西行记》
    《刘邓大军西行记》（湖南文艺出版社出版）是军内外作家撰写的二十多篇小说、散文的合集。作品反映了刘伯承、邓小平指挥的“二野”在战争年代赴汤蹈火，为民族解放事业英勇奋战，在保卫祖国和平建设时期努力学习科学文化知识，戍守边疆、为人民做新贡献的事迹。作者大多是亲历当年战斗生活的“老二野”。陈斐琴在“代序”中说，在他们的作品中，出现了建国以来第一代的边陲英雄儿女的形象，窥见了中华民族的独立、统一、团结和尊严。　（郑清源）
