A 14-year-old boy sacrificed his life for the people's interests, a deed that is both admirable and regrettable. He is Lai Ning, who was awarded the title of "Heroic Youth" by the Communist Youth League Central Committee and the State Education Commission.

Lai Ning grew up under the care of the Party. The Party's demands on the younger generation, conveyed through schools, society, and family education, have had a profound impact on Lai Ning's ideological growth. The Party eagerly anticipates a generation of youth who are "idealistic, moral, cultured, and disciplined" to inherit the legacy of their predecessors and create a bright future for the nation. Lai Ning is a typical representative of the "four-haves" new person. He has great aspirations, loves his country and people; he is diligent in thinking and doing, enthusiastic about scientific experiments, and rich in creativity; he has broad interests, is eager to learn, and develops comprehensively. When the nation's and people's property suffered severe losses, he bravely sacrificed his life to defend them. His deeds fully embody the "five-loves" spirit of the Young Pioneers. He is an outstanding Young Pioneer and an excellent young citizen of our republic.

Our cause is grand and arduous. To build a modern socialist power, the Party needs the people to unite and strive together for a long, tenacious, and arduous struggle. This struggle requires generation after generation of revolutionaries and builders to complete. Therefore, improving the quality of the youth, especially their ideological and moral qualities, has strategic significance for our society's development. The recent severe political struggle has reminded us even more deeply: the successors of the revolutionary cause must be cultivated from a young age, and socialist and communist ideological education must begin from a young age.

Through Lai Ning's growth, we see how important it is to use correct ideological methods to shape people from a young age and how important it is to have a good educational environment and various educational influences. When difficulties inevitably arise during the process of reform and construction, we need to educate the youth to establish grand ideals, work diligently, and persevere; when incorrect trends of thought inevitably emerge during the process of opening up to the outside world, we need to educate the youth to understand the four cardinal principles, discern right from wrong, and maintain a correct political direction; when corruption inevitably appears during the development of socialist commodity economy, we need to educate the youth to improve their moral standards, resist the erosion of capitalist decadent thoughts, and pursue a life of true social significance. There are only ten years left in this century, and we need the youth to seize the opportunity to study hard, delve deeply, and prepare comprehensively to become qualified entrepreneurs and builders of the new century! All this is the heavy responsibility of educators and ideological workers.

Lai Ning is a representative of the new generation of children. He has proven that our youth have hope, and thus also proven that our cause has hope. I hope that all primary and secondary school students across the country will learn from Lai Ning's example, be good children of the Party like him, live a meaningful life like him, and place the interests of the nation and the people above all else, becoming "four-haves" new people who are worthy of the times and the nation's expectations.

    学习赖宁
    邓颖超
    一个年仅14岁的孩子，为了人民的利益牺牲了自己的生命，令人敬佩而又痛惜。他就是被共青团中央和国家教委授予了“英雄少年”称号的赖宁。
    赖宁是从小在党的关怀下成长起来的。党对于青少年一代的要求，通过学校、社会和家庭的教育而对赖宁的思想成长产生了深刻影响。党殷切期望着“有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律”的一代青少年去继承前辈的事业，开创国家的美好未来。赖宁就是“四有”新人的一个典型。他胸怀大志、爱国爱民；他勤于动脑动手，热衷科学试验，富有创造精神；他兴趣广泛，求知若渴，全面发展。当国家和人民的财产蒙受严重损失时，他不惜以生命去保卫。他的事迹，集中体现了少先队的“五爱”精神，他是一位优秀的少先队员，也是我们共和国优秀的小公民。
    我们的事业是宏伟而艰巨的。为了建设现代化的社会主义强国，党需要人民同心同德，作长期的、坚韧的、艰苦的奋斗。而这种奋斗，需要由一代接一代的革命者和建设者来完成，因此，提高作为接班人的青少年一代的素质尤其是提高他们的思想品德素质，对我们社会的发展具有战略意义。前不久发生的那场严重的政治斗争更深刻地提醒我们：革命事业的接班人要从小培养，社会主义思想和共产主义思想的教育要从小进行。
    通过赖宁的成长我们看到，用正确的思想方法从小抓紧人的塑造是多么重要，良好的教育环境和各种教育影响的配合是多么重要。当改革和建设过程中不可避免地出现种种困难的时候，我们需要教育青少年一代树立远大理想，踏实奋斗，百折不挠；当对外开放过程中不可避免地遇到某些错误思潮的繁衍的时候，我们需要教育青少年一代懂得四项基本原则，明辨是非，坚定正确的政治方向；当发展社会主义商品经济中出现某些腐败现象的时候，我们需要教育青少年一代提高道德水准，抵御资本主义腐朽思想的侵蚀，追求有真正的社会意义的人生价值。本世纪只剩下十年时间了，我们多么需要教育青少年一代抓紧学习，刻苦钻研，作好全面的准备，成为新世纪的合格创业者和建设者！而这一切，正是教育工作者和思想工作者的重大的责任。
    赖宁是新一代少年儿童的代表。他证明了我们的青少年一代是有希望的，从而也证明了我们事业的未来是有希望的。我希望全国的中小学生都来学习赖宁的榜样，像他那样做党的好孩子，像他那样有意义地生活，像他那样把国家和人民的利益看得高于一切，做无愧于时代要求和祖国期望的“四有”新人。
