Harbin Railway Bureau Achieves "Safety Year"

People's Daily, Harbin, October 15th - By the beginning of October, Harbin Railway Bureau has achieved its first "safety year" in 43 years since its establishment. Recently, the Ministry of Railways held a commendation meeting in Harbin to recognize their achievements.

In 1986, after the implementation of the responsibility system for railway operations, the bureau, considering its remote location and outdated equipment, invested approximately 400 million yuan in equipment upgrades. Over four years, they invested a total of 1.7 billion yuan in these upgrades. Recently, despite financial constraints, they managed to raise 600 million yuan to upgrade and add 16 safety-critical facilities. They also equipped the locomotives with signal systems, automatic braking devices, and driver radios, known as the "three essentials."

    哈尔滨铁路局实现“安全年”
    本报哈尔滨10月15日电　哈尔滨铁路局到10月初，实现建局43年第一个“安全年”。最近，铁道部在哈尔滨铁路局召开的庆功大会上，表彰了他们取得的这一成绩。
    1986年，铁路实现大包干后，针对路局地处边远，设备陈旧落后的实际，投资4000万元左右进行设备改造，4年投入改造资金达1.7亿元。最近，他们在资金压缩的“大气候”下，筹集6000万元，改造和增添了16项保证安全生产的设施。他们还对机车信号、自动停车装置和司机电台等“三大件”进行配备。（李青　刘英贵　潘广韬）
