Here, once stood a quiet mountain wilderness. Ten years ago, a railway construction team, seasoned by battles, spotted this auspicious land. They set up camp at the foot of the mountain, amidst a grove of peach and pomegranate trees, establishing a quarry to supply ballast for the railway. From then on, the place was no longer secluded or tranquil. Amidst the roar of blasting and crushing machines, a torrent of stone debris, as large as pomegranates and peaches, flowed endlessly from the giant tortoise's feet...

It was also in that year that a secluded "island," far from any village or camp, was surrounded by walls and an iron gate, creating a tranquil corner. The island's owners—five men with different accents—guarded explosives, detonators, and fuse cords that could remain silent forever or destroy everything.

It is said that this is the largest fireworks depot in the province. The five men, of course, knew the weight of their responsibility. Without these explosives, detonators, and fuse cords, the quarry would not be bustling, and the stone torrent would not flow. However, if there was any negligence in management, their names could become "destruction" or "death."

This place requires courage and determination, as well as patience and meticulousness.

Twenty-four hours a day, alert eyes are always on patrol.

During the day, the iron gate is tightly locked. Only at fixed times, when designated personnel come to pick up or store the fireworks needed by the quarry, does the iron gate open briefly.

At night, unless the moon is full and the stars are dense, the "island" is pitch black. The flickering light of the patrolmen's flashlights and the crunching of their footsteps, the faint glow of candles in the dormitory, add a touch of tranquility and mystery to the night on the "island."

Three meals a day, the five men cook for themselves in a small kitchen they built. Their staple food is rice and noodles bought from the quarry's canteen each month, while their vegetables come from the garden they cultivated themselves. Even drinking water is available without leaving the island, flowing abundantly from a hand-pumped well, clear and sweet. All this gives the "island" a pastoral charm, but also brings hardship and toil to its owners.

Because of its remote location, there is no electricity, so no radio or television. Only a copy of "People's Railway" brings news from the outside world. Once or twice a month, the camp leader comes to inspect the work and chat with them, which is the happiest time for the "island's" owners.

Each year, the five men take turns returning to Guizhou, Sichuan, and Hunan to visit their families for 20 days. On the day they return to the camp, the visitor shares their travel experiences and news from home. Thus, there is laughter, teasing, and hometown tunes, as well as homesickness. But soon, the "island" returns to its regular routine, like the swing of a clock: patrolling familiar buildings, working in the garden, reading newspapers and letters over and over, or climbing the lookout tower to gaze at the distant mountains, which resemble two giant tortoises whispering to each other, and the lush orchards and moving figures in the wheat fields.

One day, a group of villagers working in their responsibility fields suddenly gathered outside the iron gate. Curious eyes peered through the iron bars, taking in everything within the narrow, walled area: four brick houses of varying sizes, arranged at equal but irregular intervals; lush vegetable plots on both sides of the path from the iron gate to the top of the wall; five middle-aged men busy with their tasks... People discussed and guessed, "What are they doing?" "Is it a prison?" "Why aren't there any armed guards?" "Is it a warehouse?" "Why isn't there a sign at the gate?"... Unable to guess, they gradually dispersed, each with their own doubts. Thus, another endless story about the "island" and the five men was added to the foot of the Tortoise Mountain.

Only those who blast in the quarry, amidst the roar of explosions, know the names of the five men in this story...

    “孤岛”上默默的奉献者
    程建伟
    这里，曾是一片寂静的山野。十年前，一支南征北战的铁路队伍看中了这块风水宝地，他们在山脚下的一片桃林和石榴树旁安营扎寨，建起了一个采石场，为铁路建设提供道碴。从此，这里不再闭塞，不再静谧。在开山炮、碎石机的轰鸣声中，巨龟的脚下又源源不断地涌流出像石榴、蜜桃大小的石渣之瀑……
    也是在那一年，远离村庄和队伍驻地的一块“孤岛”上，围墙和铁门圈起一隅恬静。孤岛的主人——五个不同口音的男人，在这里守卫着可以永远沉默，也可以摧毁一切的炸药、雷管、导火索。
    据说，这是这个省县境内最大的一个火工品库，五个男人当然掂量得出自己肩上的份量。没有这些炸药、雷管、导火索之类的东西，采石场将不再沸腾，石瀑将不再流淌，但是，如果管理上稍有不慎，它们的名字就可能是“毁灭”或“死亡”。
    这里需要果敢和毅力，也需要耐心和细致。
    一天24小时，时刻都有警觉的目光在巡视。
    白天，铁门紧锁。唯有在每天固定的时间由固定的人员来这里领取和存放石场需要的火工品时，铁门才有短暂的开启。
    夜晚，除非明月当空，繁星密布，“孤岛”上一片黑暗。巡守人员手中时明时灭的手电光柱和嚓嚓的脚步声，宿舍里荧荧的烛光，使“孤岛”之夜平添了几分平静和神秘。
    一日三餐，五个男人在自己搭盖的小厨房里亲自动手，主食是每月从石场职工食堂买回的米和面条，菜则是自己开垦的菜地里长的，连饮用水也可足不出门，一口手压机井里汩汩流淌的水是那样清洌、甘甜。这一切赋予“孤岛”田园牧歌般的情趣，当然也给它的主人们以生活劳作的艰辛劳苦。
    由于地处偏僻，没有电，也就听不到广播，看不上电视，唯有一份《人民铁道》传来外面的信息。一个月中，有那么一两次，场领导来检查工作，和他们聊聊天，这便是“孤岛”主人们最高兴的时候了。
    每年，五个男人轮流回贵州，四川、湖南探亲20天。归队那天，探亲者向伙伴们介绍自己旅途和家乡的见闻。于是，有了欢笑，有了打趣，有了家乡小调，也有了乡愁缕缕……但很快，“孤岛”又复钟表摆动般循规蹈矩：或巡逻在熟稔的建筑物前；或忙碌在菜园里，或一遍又一遍地看着报纸，读着家信；或登上瞭望台眺望远处酷似两只巨龟在窃窃私语的大山，还有郁郁葱葱的果园，点点人影移动的麦田。
    一日，铁门外，突然围了一群去责任田里耕作的村民，好奇的目光透过铁门的栅栏，把围墙内狭长地带上的一切看了个够：四间等距却又不规则排列的大小砖瓦房；一条从铁门透向围墙顶端的小径两旁块块菜地青翠欲滴；五个中年男子在各自忙碌着……人们议论、猜测：“他们是干什么的？”“是监狱吗？”“怎么没有拿枪的？”“是仓库？”“门口怎么不挂块牌子？”……实在猜不出来，他们便带着各自的疑团渐渐散去。于是，龟山脚下又多了一个永远也讲不完的关于“孤岛”和五个男人的故事。
    只有那些在石碴场开山放炮的人们，在炮声隆隆的轰鸣中知道这个故事里的五个男人的名字……
