	Bush Inspects San Francisco Earthquake Disaster Area
	People's Daily, Washington, October 20th — Correspondent Clang Lide reports: U.S. President Bush today inspected the earthquake disaster area in the San Francisco Bay area of California and called on residents to "help each other among friends and neighbors," to jointly overcome the difficulties.

	Bush mainly surveyed the disaster situations in San Jose, Oakland, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz. At the scene of the collapsed double-deck bridge on Interstate 880 in Oakland, he met with local residents and relief workers. He said that the severe damage caused by this earthquake far exceeded his expectations.

	Today, the disaster area still experienced minor aftershocks. In densely populated areas, tens of thousands of people are either staying with friends or taking refuge in public places arranged by the government. Meanwhile, government authorities and a large number of volunteers in San Francisco and other places are continuing to provide relief to the victims. Engineering teams are busy repairing bridges and roads, demolishing dangerous buildings, and restoring water and electricity pipelines. The search for victims buried under the rubble is also being expedited.

	The White House has allocated more than $300 million for emergency assistance; Congress is raising at least $2.5 billion in relief funds. California officials estimate that the total property loss is conservatively estimated at $3 billion; local insurance companies estimate the total amount to be $4 billion. The governor of California said that the loss can be compensated by increasing taxes.

　　布什视察旧金山地震灾区
    本报华盛顿10月20日电  记者仓立德报道：美国总统布什今天视察了加利福尼亚州旧金山湾地震灾区，并呼吁居民“朋友之间互助，邻里之间相帮”，共渡难关。
    布什主要察看了圣何塞、奥克兰、旧金山、圣克鲁斯四地的灾情，并在奥克兰880号州际高速公路断裂的双层桥现场会见了当地群众和救灾人员。他表示，这次地震造成的严重灾害远远超出他的预料。
    今日灾区仍有轻微余震。人口稠密地区仍有成千上万人或在朋友家借宿，或在政府安排的公共场所藏身。与此同时，旧金山等地政府当局和大批志愿人员正继续全力救济灾民。工程队忙于抢修桥梁、道路，拆除危险房屋，修复水、电管道。寻找埋藏在瓦砾之中死伤者的工作也在加紧进行。
    白宫已为紧急援助拨款3亿多美元；国会正在筹措至少25亿美元的救灾款。加州官员认为全部财产损失据保守估计为30亿美元；当地保险公司估计总额达40亿美元。加州州长表示可用提高税收弥补损失。
