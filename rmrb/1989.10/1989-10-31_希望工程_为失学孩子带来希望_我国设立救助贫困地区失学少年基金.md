"The Hope Project" Brings Hope to Dropout Children
China Establishes Fund to Aid Impoverished Dropout Youth

Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Sutra and People's Daily reporter Yuan Jian Da reported from Beijing on October 30: The China Youth Development Foundation announced today that it will establish a fund to aid impoverished dropout youth, providing long-term assistance to academically excellent children in poor areas who have dropped out of school due to financial difficulties, allowing them to return to school.

This aid project, named the "Hope Project," has received the approval and support of many party and state leaders, especially the older generation of revolutionaries. Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, wrote an inscription: "Aid impoverished dropout youth, foster a good tradition of the whole society caring for young people." Marshal Nie Rongzhen's inscription reads: "For the children, for the future." Comrade Shu Mengqi, at the age of 93, donated 2000 yuan.

At a press conference held today, Liu Yandong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and Chairman of the China Youth Development Foundation, announced the specific assistance methods of the fund for impoverished dropout youth:

1. Establish scholarships to provide long-term assistance to academically excellent children in poor areas who have dropped out of school due to financial difficulties, allowing them to return to school.
2. Build and repair school buildings in some impoverished villages.
3. Purchase teaching aids, stationery, and books for some impoverished village primary schools.

The foundation will adhere to the principle of taking from society, establishing a fund, making it public to society, and benefiting children. It will contribute to the economic development of impoverished areas and to improving the cultural quality of China's youth.

It is understood that the average level of education in China is less than 5 years, and basic education is even weaker. In recent years, the dropout rate of primary and secondary school students in China has been on the rise. In more than 190 counties where the problem of basic subsistence has not been solved, the situation of children being unable to attend school due to financial difficulties is even more severe.

Approved by the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the foundation was established in March of this year. Its purpose is to seek support and sponsorship from domestic and overseas organizations and individuals who care about the cause of Chinese youth, to promote the development of youth work, social education, science and technology, culture, and welfare in China, to promote modernization construction and national reunification, to promote friendly relations among youth around the world, and to maintain world peace. The foundation is jointly established by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the National Working Committee on Children and Women.

　　“希望工程”为失学孩子带来希望
    我国设立救助贫困地区失学少年基金
    本报北京10月30日讯　新华社记者张宿堂、本报记者袁建达报道：中国青少年发展基金会今天在这里作出决定：设立救助贫困地区失学少年基金会，长期资助我国贫困地区品学兼优而又因家庭困难失学的孩子重新获得受教育的机会。
    这项被命名为“希望工程”的救助活动，得到了许多党和国家领导人特别是老一辈革命家的赞许和支持。全国政协主席李先念为此题了词：“救助贫困地区失学少年，形成全社会关心青少年的好风尚。”聂荣臻元帅的题词是：“为了孩子，为了未来。”93岁高龄的帅孟奇同志捐献了2000元钱。
    共青团中央书记处书记、中国青少年发展基金会理事长刘延东在今天举行的新闻发布会上宣布，救助贫困地区失学少年基金的具体资助方式包括：
    一、设立助学金，长期资助我国贫困地区品学兼优而又因家庭困难失学的孩子重返校园；二、为一些贫困乡村新盖、修缮小学校舍；三、为一些贫困乡村小学购置教具、文具和书籍。这家基金会将本着取诸社会、建立基金、公诸社会、造福孩子的宗旨，为促进贫困地区的经济发展，为提高我国青少年的文化素质做出贡献。
    据了解，我国平均受教育程度不足5年，基础教育则更为薄弱，近几年来，我国中小学生流失量呈上升趋势，在尚未解决温饱问题的190多个县中，中小学生因家庭困难而无法上学的状况则更为严重。
    经中国人民银行和民政部批准，于今年3月成立的这家基金会，其宗旨是，争取海内外关心中国青少年事业的团体、人士的支持和赞助，促进中国青少年工作、社会教育、科技、文化和福利事业的发展，推动现代化建设和祖国统一，促进国际间青少年的友好关系，维护世界和平。基金会由共青团中央、全国青联、全国学联、全国少工委共同创办。
