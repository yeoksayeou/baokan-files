On November 20, 1988, the "Polar" scientific expedition ship set sail from Qingdao, marking China's first voyage to the eastern Antarctic. More than a month later, on January 14 of this year, the "Polar" encountered a massive ice collapse at the Dokker Ice Shelf on the Antarctic coast...

This was a rare scene in the 200-year history of Antarctic exploration:

"A heart-stopping sight as the iceberg collapsed," a reporter on the "Polar" described, "First, there was a deafening roar, and a cloud of snow and broken ice rose into the air. The collapsing ice pushed forward, creating a scene of mountains crumbling and waves surging..."

The ice flow surged towards the "Polar," emitting terrifying sounds. The tragedy of the ship sinking and lives being lost seemed imminent. On the "Polar," someone rushed into the bridge: "Captain, turn around and retreat quickly."

Surprisingly, Captain Wei Wenliang did not retreat but advanced. He maneuvered the ship to the right, struggling through the ice blocks towards the reef area ahead. For the 116 crew members and expedition team members on the "Polar," Wei Wenliang's move was a desperate gamble, as the "Polar" faced the danger of being overturned by the ice flow and now added the risk of running aground.

The "Polar" moved into a small patch of sea, with a few dozen meters ahead, the protruding coastline and underwater reefs obstructing the ice flow. Only then did people realize that if they had turned around and retreated, the ship would have sunk into the ice sea.

The ship was saved, but before them was a scene of "white terror": icebergs and ice blocks piled up in layers, stretching from the horizon to the ship's side. The expedition team was forced to disperse to the shore, sliding down the gangway, carrying their luggage, and staggering across the ice.

Watching all this, Wei Wenliang cried. A few months ago, when he drew a route on the sea chart extending to the Prydz Bay in the Antarctic with a pencil, he dreamed of establishing the Zhongshan Station and letting the Five-Star Red Flag fly for the first time on the Antarctic continent. Now, the ship was trapped in the "Polar" region. Would all his ideals and struggles be swallowed by the ice flow?

In March 1988, the 38-year-old Wei Wenliang took command of the "Polar." Wei Wenliang, born into a farming family, joined the navy in 1968 and became a naval soldier. He later transferred from the military to civilian roles and from coastal to deep-sea voyages. Although he had over 20 years of sea experience and excellent academic records, people still privately worried for him: sailing is inherently risky, and this ten-thousand-ton ship was not an ordinary warship or transport vessel; it was to open a new route to the eastern Antarctic.

At 45 degrees south latitude, the "Polar" entered the "Roaring Forties." At this point, the waves were 9 meters high, and the large ship seemed like a small boat, tossed up and down. In the bridge, Wei Wenliang had not eaten or slept for two days and two nights. His gallbladder inflammation had relapsed, causing persistent cramps. But now, he could not rest. He propped up his abdomen with his hand, relying on a large dose of pills, enduring for 4 days and 4 nights, and navigated the "Polar" through the "Roaring Forties."

The ship reached the ice zone, and icebergs and ice blocks floated towards them. This icebreaking ship, according to its design capacity, could break through 1-meter-thick ice at 60% concentration (i.e., ice covering 60% of the sea surface), but the ice blocks ahead were becoming denser, and the entire sea surface was covered by 2-3-meter-thick ice blocks, making it impossible for the ship to break through the floating ice...

Wei Wenliang knew that in the history of world navigation, ships had been frozen in the ice many times. China, from Zheng He's voyages to the present, had no ship captain with ice zone navigation experience. He now had to open a new route in the ice zone.

Left and right maneuvers, advancing and retreating, the "Polar" searched for gaps in the floating ice, sometimes taking 4 hours to travel just 1 nautical mile. Wei Wenliang faced enormous resistance, almost using the icebreaking ship as an icebreaker. He set the course and struggled for 5 days and nights. The "Polar," covered in wounds, left a difficult and unimaginable trail in the 800-nautical-mile ice zone.

The "Polar" finally reached the eastern Antarctic, but greater difficulties and dangers awaited.

A message from a nearby Soviet station: the kilometer-thick ice shelf on the Antarctic coast was still sliding and could collapse at any moment...

Wei Wenliang was exhausted. He had to arrange the "Polar's" "aftermath." He planned to evacuate most of the crew, leaving only 7 people to guard the "Polar," with himself as the first. Everyone knew that surviving the "deadly Antarctic" winter with insufficient supplies meant what.

However, no one on the ship left their post. Danger increased their courage, and the captain's spirit became the spirit of the entire ship. We can say that from this moment on, a new term was added to the history of China's Antarctic expeditions: the "Polar Spirit."

Wei Wenliang never lost his courage. He took a helicopter to search for a breakthrough opportunity among the surrounding icebergs. On January 21, a crack suddenly appeared between two mountains, and he knew the opportunity had come.

Wei Wenliang quickly maneuvered the ship. "Hard to port," "ahead one," "ahead three"... The 152-meter-long "Polar" struggled for over an hour, finally turning around in the heavy ice blocks. At this time, the first gap in the icebergs had closed, and a second gap appeared.

The "Polar" squeezed into the gap. The steep ice cliffs on both sides stretched towards the top, slowly moving backward, as if they could collapse at any moment. All the expedition team members stood on the deck, tensely watching the captain in the bridge.

A few minutes later, the "Polar" broke through. Behind it, the ice gap closed again; ahead, a vast ocean opened up.

The 7-day, 7-night gloom was instantly dispelled, and people cried tears of joy, then could not help but cheer.

On February 26, 1989, the Chinese Antarctic Zhongshan Station was completed.

On April 10, after a 142-day voyage covering 33,000 kilometers, the battered "Polar" returned to China.

On April 28, the "Polar" was awarded a collective first-class merit citation, and Wei Wenliang was awarded a first-class merit citation. He himself had forgotten how many times he had been awarded for his 21 years of sea work, but the reporter found out: this was the 10th time.

    极地之魂
    ——记“极地”号科学考察船船长魏文良
    本报记者　凌志军
    1988年11月20日，“极地”号科学考察船离开青岛，开始中国航海史上首次东南极之行。一个多月之后的今年1月14日，“极地”号遇南极陆缘道克尔冰川特大冰崩……
    这是200余年南极探险史上罕见的场面：
    “冰山崩塌时惊心动魄”，当时在“极地”号上的一位记者描述道，“先是轰然一声巨响，白雪与碎冰组成的烟雾腾空而起，塌下的冰盖后面推着前面，排山倒海……”
    冰流涌向“极地”号，发出令人惊恐的怪声，船毁人亡的悲剧就在眼前。“极地”号上，有人冲进驾驶室：“船长，赶快掉头后撤。”
    令人吃惊的是，船长魏文良不退反进。他操船右摆，在冰块的挤撞中挣扎着向前方的礁石区靠去。对116名船员和考察队员来说，魏文良此举可算是拚死的一搏，因为“极地”号在被冰流撞翻的危险中，又增加了一重触礁的危险。
    “极地”号移进一块小小的海域，前边几十米处，突出的陆缘和水下暗礁阻滞着冰流。这时人们才发现，假如当初掉头向后，船将沉入冰海。
    船保住了，但眼前又是一片“白色恐怖”：冰山连着冰块，层层叠叠，从天边一直挤到船舷。考察队员被迫向岸上疏散，滑下舷梯，扛着包袱，在冰上蹒跚而行。
    望着这一切，魏文良哭了。几个月前，当他用铅笔在海图上把一条航线沿伸到南极普里兹湾时，心中想的是，建成中山站，让五星红旗第一次飘扬在南极大陆上。如今，船困于“极地”，莫非一切理想与奋斗都要付诸冰流？
    1988年3月，38岁的魏文良调任“极地”号船长。魏文良出身农家，1968年入伍成为一名海军战士，此后又由军队到地方，由近海至远洋。尽管他有20余年的海上经历和优异的院校成绩，但人们仍在私下里为他担心：行船本就三分险，更何况这艘万吨级轮船不是一般的战舰或运输船，它要开辟到达东南极的新航线。
    在南纬45度，“极地”号进入“西风带”。此时，浪高9米，大船似一叶小舟，抛上跌下。驾驶室中，魏文良已两天两夜没吃没睡。他的胆囊炎复发，持续绞痛。可现在，躺下休息也不能。他用手顶着腹部，靠着大把的药片，挺过4天4夜，驾“极地”号穿过“西风带”。
    船抵冰区，冰山和冰块迎面浮来。这条抗冰船按设计能力可抗1米厚的六成冰（即浮冰占海面60％以下），但眼前冰块越来越密，整个海面全被两三米厚的冰块封住，船无法冲破浮冰……
    魏文良知道世界航海史上曾多次出现船被冰封冻在海上的事，中国则从郑和下西洋至今，没有任何一位船长有过冰区航行的经历。他现在要做的是，开辟冰区航行的新航路。
    左突右拐，进进退退，“极地”号在浮冰中寻找着缝隙，有时4小时才仅仅航行1海里。魏文良面对着特大的阻力，几乎是用抗冰船来当破冰船。他把定航向，苦苦拚搏5昼夜，“极地”号带着满身伤痕，在800海里天险冰区留下一条难以想象的艰难的航迹。
    “极地”号终于到达东南极，但迎接她的是更大的艰难险阻。
    附近的苏联站送来的消息：南极陆缘千米厚的冰盖仍在滑动，随时可能再次崩塌……
    魏文良疲惫不堪。他不得不为他的船安排“后事”。他计划撤走大部分船员，只留7人坚守“极地”，7人当中，他自己是第一人。人人皆知，在给养不足的情况下度过人称“死极”的南极冬季，意味着什么。
    但是，全船无一人离开岗位。危难增加了他们的勇气，船长的精神正在成为全船的精神。我们可以说，从这时起，中国南极考察史上留下一个新的词，这就是“极地精神”。
    魏文良从未失去勇气，他乘直升飞机在四围冰山间寻找着突围的机会。1月21日，两山间忽现一条裂缝，他知道机会来了。
    魏文良迅疾操船。“左满舵”、“进一”、“进三”……152米长的“极地”号挣扎了1个多小时，终于在重重冰块中掉过头来。此时冰山的第一道缝隙已经合龙，又现出第二道缝隙。
    “极地”号挤进缝隙。数十米高的冰的峭壁在两舷侧畔伸向头顶，缓缓后移，好像随时都要崩塌下来。所有的考察队员都站在甲板上，紧张地盯着驾驶室里的船长。
    几分钟后，“极地”号冲出来。后面，冰缝再度合龙；前面，一片开阔的大洋。
    7天7夜的沉闷一扫而光，人们喜极而泣，转而又情不自禁地欢呼起来。
    1989年2月26日，中国南极中山站落成。
    4月10日，在为期142天、经历33000公里的航行之后，伤痕累累的“极地”号返回中国。
    4月28日，“极地”号荣立集体一等功，魏文良立一等功。他自己已经忘记这是他21年海上工作中第几次立功受奖，但是记者查到了，这是第10次。
