Tanzanian Revolutionary Party Cables Chinese Party Central Committee
Celebrates 40th Anniversary of PRC

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 12th - The Central Committee of the Tanzanian Revolutionary Party's National Executive Committee sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on October 6th, expressing warm congratulations on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The telegram stated, "The entire membership of the Tanzanian Revolutionary Party and the people of Tanzania join the tens of millions of Chinese Communist Party members and the friendly people of China in celebrating the fruitful efforts of the past 40 years, efforts that began with the struggle for liberation and, under the heroic leadership of the Communist Party of China, established a new state for the Chinese people."

The telegram continued, "For countless oppressed peoples around the world who strive to free themselves from colonialism and imperialist oppression and domination, and to achieve their own liberation, the example of the Chinese Revolution has been and will continue to be an inspiring source. It has shown and will continue to show oppressed nations that, under the leadership of a powerful people's party, a nation can free itself from oppression, gain freedom, and build a country according to its own choices. It also shows that a people's revolution does not need the approval of others, but rather the freedom and independence of its own people."

The telegram said, "The People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, has admirably withstood the test of time and has become a powerful symbol of hope and dignity among Southern countries. The Tanzanian Revolutionary Party highly praises the glorious achievements made by the Communist Party of China in the past 40 years of arduous struggle and is committed to continuing to develop bilateral cooperation characterized by traditional friendship and unity."
