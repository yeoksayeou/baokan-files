Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 24th.

The passing of Comrade Zeng Xianzhi, an outstanding organizer and leader of China's women's movement, has deeply saddened women across the country. This morning, nearly 800 people, including Honorary Chairwoman Kang Keqing and Chairwoman Chen Mu Hua of the All-China Women's Federation, gathered to commemorate her revolutionary and illustrious life.

Comrade Deng Yingchao sent her regards to Zeng Xianzhi's children and relatives through her staff.

Those who joined in commemorating Zeng Xianzhi included Wang Ping and Huang Hua, members of the Central Advisory Commission, Vice Chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lei Jieqiong, State Councilor Zhou Jiaxua, Deputy Chairwoman and First Secretary of the All-China Women's Federation Zhang Zhuoying, and other veteran leaders of the women's movement.

The couplets hanging in the hall, such as "Thinking for the Party and the people, pushing honor aside and taking on responsibilities, not caring for criticism or praise, with a will as firm as Mount Tai and a heart as vast as the sea; not calculating gains or losses, striving for the truth, raising objections face-to-face, treating superiors and subordinates equally, with a bond as pure as white jade and a spirit as enduring as a rainbow," and "Upright and selfless, a true model of integrity and public service," expressed the deep respect and nostalgia people had for Zeng Xianzhi's high moral character.

Chen Mu Hua said with deep emotion that Comrade Zeng Xianzhi worked in the All-China Women's Federation for 40 years, participating in and overseeing the daily work of the federation, and was in charge of personnel, logistics, foreign affairs, and women's united front work. As one of the leaders, her high sense of responsibility, meticulous organizational skills, decisive work style, and upright work ethic were all praised by the masses. Her high moral character won her the respect and love of people both within and outside the Party.

Chen Mu Hua said, Comrade Zeng Xianzhi's life was a revolutionary and illustrious one. Her passing is a great loss to our Party, as we have lost a good Party member and a good cadre, and the cadres and masses have lost a rare confidant, mentor, and friend. We feel immense grief! We mourn her to learn from and carry forward her noble virtues of wholeheartedly serving the people, staying close to the masses, upholding the truth, seeking truth from facts, being frugal, and serving the public with integrity. We should strive to be genuine Communists, for the purity of the Party and the modernization of our country!

Kang Keqing, Chen Mu Hua, and other comrades also warmly met with Zeng Xianzhi's children and relatives, expressing their deep condolences.
