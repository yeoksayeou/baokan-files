This year marks a year of celebration for Pakistan International Airlines: the 35th anniversary of PIA's establishment, the 25th anniversary of PIA's flights to China, and the 15th anniversary of Chinese civil aviation flights to Pakistan.

Over the past 35 years, PIA has struggled and grown into one of the world's top ten airlines. When PIA was founded in 1954, it could only operate short domestic routes, severely lacking in technical personnel and funds, with outdated aircraft and airport facilities. Today, PIA has grown into a large enterprise with nearly 20,000 employees and fixed assets worth approximately 7 billion rupees (about $400 million). Its annual net income exceeds 800 million rupees. PIA's more than 40 Boeing and Airbus series aircraft fly 40 international routes and 32 domestic routes.

In PIA's development history, the following records have been set: In 1960, PIA was the first among many Asian airlines to own and master the operation of Boeing 707 jetliners; in 1974, brave PIA pilots flew over the Karakoram Mountains to inaugurate flights to Beijing and Tokyo; in 1985, PIA was the first airline in Asia to introduce the twin-engine Boeing 737-300.

PIA's mission is simple and clear: to make profits, to serve passengers, and to serve the country. A PIA manager revealed the essence: to make profits, one must first provide excellent service to passengers.

In the fierce competition of the global aviation industry, PIA continuously introduces the latest technology and equipment to improve its service standards. Currently, PIA's domestic and international ticketing has been fully computerized, allowing passengers to book tickets with a simple phone call. PIA implements a low-profit, high-volume policy to expand its customer base. During the off-peak travel season, PIA offers discounts on ticket prices, sometimes charging only 50% of the original price. For foreign journalists, PIA issues discount cards, charging only half the ticket price. PIA's on-time departure and arrival rate has increased from 70% in 1970 to around 90% today.

High-quality service during the journey is the main reason for PIA's increasing passenger base. PIA's aircraft are painted white on top and green on the bottom, with "PLA" in large letters on the tail, giving a bright and cheerful impression. Upon entering the cabin, air hostesses dressed in vibrant national costumes greet each passenger with a smile. After seating, they serve drinks and the day's newspapers. For child passengers, PIA gives each a toy to keep them entertained during the journey. Cabin crew also store valuables and coats for passengers. PIA's meals are delicious and have been praised by passengers.

The spirit of PIA's cabin crew, thinking and acting on behalf of passengers, left a deep impression on the reporter. During the Pakistani general election last year, several Chinese journalists returning from an assignment in Faisalabad had a Chinese journalist suddenly suffer a heart attack shortly after takeoff, in a very critical condition. The cabin crew immediately provided an oxygen mask, and the captain sought advice on whether to continue to Islamabad or return to the airport. The Chinese journalist requested an emergency landing nearby for medical treatment. The captain immediately ordered a return. When the plane stopped, an airport ambulance was already waiting. Thanks to the close cooperation between PIA and the local hospital, the Chinese journalist quickly recovered.

Emphasizing personnel training and technological development are two important experiences of PIA. As early as the 1950s, PIA established its own "Training Center." The center not only trained a team of excellent pilots, ground staff, and cabin crew for PIA, but over the past 30 years, it has trained nearly 5,000 aviation technicians for 46 developing countries. The reporter was invited to visit PIA's Training Center. The training building is adjacent to PIA's headquarters. The center offers 122 courses from theory to practice, with detailed divisions, even including makeup for cabin crew as a course. All teaching equipment in the center has been computerized. The center's director's words are very philosophical: For Pakistan, PIA is a symbol of national pride; for foreigners, PIA is Pakistan on the wings.

PIA, in its prime, has an unlimited future.

    巴航——巴基斯坦的旗帜企业
    本报记者任　毓骏
    今年是巴基斯坦国际航空公司的喜庆之年：巴航成立35周年，巴航通航中国25周年，中国民航通航巴基斯坦15周年。
    35年来，巴航艰苦创业，逐步壮大成为世界十大航空公司之一。1954年巴航初建时，只能飞行国内短途航线，技术人才和资金严重短缺，飞机和机场设备也相当落后。如今巴航已成为拥有近2万名员工，70多亿卢比（约合4亿美元）固定资产的大型企业，年纯收入8亿卢比以上；它的40多架波音系列、空中客车等大型客机远航40条国际航线和32条国内航线。
    在巴航的发展史上，保持着如下纪录：1960年，在亚洲众多航空公司中，巴航首先拥有波音707喷气式客机并掌握了驾驶技术；1974年，勇敢的巴航飞行员飞越喀啦昆仑山首航北京和东京；1985年，巴航是亚洲第一家引进双引擎波音737—300型客机的航空公司。
    巴航的宗旨简单明确：赢利，为乘客服务，为国家服务。巴航一位经理人员道出了真谛：要想赢利，首先要为乘客提供优秀的服务。
    在世界民航界激烈的竞争中，巴航不断引进最新技术设备以提高自己的服务水平。目前，巴航国内外售票已全部实现电脑化，乘客只要打个电话就可预订机票。在票价上巴航实行薄利多销政策以扩大客源，在旅游淡季，巴航对票价实行优惠有时只收原票价的50％。对外国新闻记者，巴航发给优惠卡，只收一半票价。巴航的正点起降率已由70年的70％提高到目前的90％左右。
    旅途中的优质服务是巴航客源不断增加的主要因素。巴航班机漆成上白下绿，机尾上有“PLA”三个大字，给人以色调明快的感觉。进入机舱，身穿鲜艳民族服装的空中小姐向每位乘客微笑问好。坐定后，她们端来饮料和当天的报纸。对儿童乘客，巴航还每人赠送一件玩具，供他们在旅途中解闷。机上人员还为乘客保存贵重物品，代存西装上衣。巴航的食品美味可口，早已为乘客称道。
    巴航机上人员想乘客所想、急乘客所急的精神给记者留下了深刻印象。去年巴基斯坦大选期间，几名中国记者在赴费萨拉巴德采访归来时，其中一位中国记者在飞机起飞不久突然心脏病发作，情况十分危急。乘务员见状立即送来氧气罩，机长马上来征求意见，是继续飞往伊斯兰堡，还是返航。中国记者要求就近降落，以便就医。机长立即命令返航。当飞机停稳时，一辆机场救护车已在等候。由于巴航和当地医院的密切配合，这位中国记者很快转危为安。
    重视人员培训和技术开发是巴航的两条重要经验。早在50年代，巴航就建立了自己的
  “培训中心”，中心不仅为巴航培训了一支优秀的飞行员、地勤人员和空中服务人员的队伍，30多年来还为46个发展中国家培训了近5000名航空技术人员。记者曾应邀参观了巴航培训中心。培训大楼就在巴航总部大楼的一侧。中心设有从理论到实践的课程共122门，项目分工很细，连空中小组化妆都是一门课程。中心的全部教学设备已实现电脑化。培训中心负责人的话很有哲理：对巴基斯坦来说，巴航是民族自豪的象征；对外国人来说，巴航是机翼上的巴基斯坦。
    愿而立之年的巴航前程无限。
