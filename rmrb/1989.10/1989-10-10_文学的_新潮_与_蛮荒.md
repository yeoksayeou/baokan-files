The forefront of literature in the new era, after surging through the phases of scar literature, reflective literature, and reform literature, has spread out like the Yellow River leaping out of the Longmen Gorge, becoming an endless expanse without rules, without a main body, without goals, and suddenly presenting a scene of a thousand streams rushing and ten thousand waves leaping. Each seeks to find its own destination and confirm its own value in its own direction. Thus, the cognitive paradigm of literature has been impacted by non-rational aesthetic texts, and the radiating structure and multi-faceted layout of literature have formed. This is undoubtedly necessary and beneficial for expanding the artistic vision of writers and changing the single-minded literary thinking mode, for fully developing the artistic individuality of each writer and creating a colorful literary landscape. However, in the specific practice, due to the degree to which some writers' ideological orientation and artistic direction have deviated, not only have they failed to achieve the expected goals, but they have also caused unnecessary tumors in the new life of literature, especially in the orientation of creative thought and aesthetic value, there has been some confusion and bewilderment.

Among these, the sequential appearance of "new wave" literature and "barbarism" literature, and their increasing prevalence over a period, are two obvious examples.

The Contradictions of the "New Wave"

"New wave" literature, in terms of its form and essence, is often not truly new. Instead, it is an imitation and mimicry of Western modernist literature, especially the various schools of Western postmodernist literature. It is a type of non-rational literature that follows in the footsteps of Western modernist literature, differing from the national traditions and realistic spirit of Chinese literature in both aesthetic texts and artistic methods. It seeks to carry modern consciousness and modern psychological distortions as its basic aesthetic form and aesthetic pursuit. This makes "new wave" literature inevitably possess a certain degree of instability and dispersion in the construction of socialist new era literature.

From the perspective of actual creative practice, although many "new wave" writers have shown extraordinary literary talent and a precious, vibrant spirit of exploration in their works, if one traces the social significance, spirit of the times, ideological connotations, and life burden of these works, one will find them to be externally ornate but internally empty, alienated from the times and reality, causing bewilderment and despair, and revealing the loss of national cultural spirit and the erosion of traditional aesthetic power. Especially difficult to find in these works is the inner radiance of Chinese new literature since the May Fourth Movement, the spirit of revolutionary realism, the progressive human spirit, and the beauty, morality, and strength in literature. As a result, the initial intention and original meaning of exploration and innovation are violated.

The occurrence of this cause-and-effect reversal is mainly due to the fact that some "new wave" writers, in the process of embracing "avant-garde" literature, have shown a hasty attitude, vague direction, psychological imbalance, and a certain degree of tilt in their aesthetic subjectivity. They consciously or unconsciously show a blind devaluation of national literary traditions and revolutionary literary traditions, a reverse transcendence of realism, and a clear non-rational and non-social tendency. Therefore, they inevitably encounter obstacles or disruptions with life, with the times, and with society at different levels and in different senses, leading to a one-sided return to literature itself and a tendency towards pure symbolism, as well as confusion in the themes of the works and absurdity in their forms. Unconsciously, they distance the ideological connotations and aesthetic forms of literature from the consciousness and aesthetic tastes of the people, and distance the social responsibility that literature bears from life and the times.

It is precisely in this process of gradual "distancing" that the "avant-garde" writers, who aim to ride the wave of the times in literature, encounter a reverse movement between their subjective intentions and objective effects in their creative journey. At least in some stages or in some of their works, they show this tendency and trace. Some writers are full of creative vitality and a spirit of exploration, but many "new wave" writers' "exploratory" works do not have any unique creations, let alone any unique discoveries of their own. They often imitate, in the rejection of national literary traditions and realistic spirit, the black humor, symbolism, expressionism, surrealism, absurdism, stream-of-consciousness, and imagism of Western modernist literature in an intentional manner.

Of course, selectively and appropriately absorbing some useful and beneficial artistic nutrients from Western modernist literature is necessary and essential. However, this absorption must be selective and elevated, it must be useful and beneficial to us, it must be fully understood and truly integrated, and it cannot be at the cost of eroding the realistic spirit and social responsibility of socialist literature, abandoning the traditional aesthetic character and national artistic individuality of literature. Otherwise, it fundamentally violates the original intention and meaning of "absorption" and "exploration."

It is no secret that some "new wave" literature has always been unable to shake off the shadow of Western modernism, always unable to step out of the ivory tower of literature, and can only float up and down in a very narrow circle. This cannot be said to be an unimportant reason.

The Missteps of "Barbarism"

In terms of aesthetic texts, "barbarism" literature is consistent with "new wave" literature, but in terms of artistic form, it is opposed to "new wave" literature. This is the phenomenon of "barbarism" in literature, or "barbarism" literature.

The term "barbarism" naturally implies savagery and desolation. However, for "barbarism" literature, its essence is not limited to this. In a more fundamental sense, it refers to a regression from modern civilization to the totemic era, a return of human nature to bestiality, and a rediscovery and nostalgia for a primitive consciousness and primitive state that have long been buried by history, surpassed by the times, and eliminated by reality.

In the chaotic and disorderly multi-faceted literary landscape of the "new wave," this phenomenon is obvious and prominent, even becoming a trend and a "hotspot." Many works that aim to express cultural roots often immerse themselves in the negative exaggeration and appreciation of national history and national spirit, while deliberately burying and abandoning the backbone of national history and national spirit. It seems that only Gabriel García Márquez and his "One Hundred Years of Solitude" can be considered as the eternal charm of cultural root-seeking novels. In fact, every nation has its own cultural "roots," and their forms and connotations are vastly different. For the Chinese nation, although there are spiritual burdens similar to Ah Q, there are also the heroic spirit and greatness of Yi shooting down the nine suns, Nüwa mending the sky, and Yu controlling the floods. Even before the mid-Qing Dynasty, China was a world power in both economy and culture. The brilliant ancient Chinese civilization is still being promoted and applied by many countries around the world as an indispensable spiritual factor for achieving economic takeoff.

However, in some of our cultural root-seeking works, there is almost no trace of these. What we see is backwardness, ignorance, stubbornness, and laziness. A large number of works are constructed and pursued with such aesthetic texts. Even in some works that are quite successful, there are sometimes traces of this, as if it were difficult to suppress. The negative aspects of life and consciousness that have long disappeared or occasionally remain in reality are deliberately unearthed, strengthened, and magnified in literary works, and even fabricated and invented at will. This is certainly not faithful to life and history, but rather a compromise with the writer's subjective image and feelings. Since these are not the essence of history and life, the writer's compromise inevitably leads to a literary misstep.

The interest and purpose lie in the original savagery, historical filth, and negative aspects of human nature, which is a misinterpretation of the original meaning and mission of literature! Any literature, if it does not take the discovery and expression of the beauty of life and human nature as its main purpose, does not take the great tide of life and the spirit of the times as the starting point and goal of its aesthetic creation, cannot give people passion, reason, conscience, and strength, cannot purify people's souls, elevate their thoughts, and continuously lead people to new and higher levels of life and spiritual realms, cannot permeate the backbone of history, the soul of the nation, and the direction of life in the artistic essence, will lose the value and meaning inherent in literature itself, and will make literature lose its essence and no longer be literature. In "barbarism" literature, some writers have deviated precisely at this point. They have turned considering both sides into considering only one side, that is, only considering this side of history, and that is the negative side of this side. Although this type of "barbarism" literature is classified as "cultural root-seeking," what is often presented on paper is often vulgar personalities, savage actions, ignorant consciousness, and even beheading, skinning, and bestial desires.

Wild and bestial sexual descriptions are a hotspot in barbarism literature. The rise of this "hotspot" is said to be for the purpose of arousing the sublime life instinct, devaluing the rational tendency of society, displaying the shackles that traditional culture brings to human nature through blood ties, and invigorating the original divine power of reproductive worship and the original impulse of sexual instinct, thereby achieving a return to human instinct and a renewal of national life! Regardless of the scientific nature of this literary "goal" itself, the fact that it returns to the prehistoric period of barbarism in terms of ideological orientation, returns to individual life intuition, returns to primitive customs and natural wilderness, and returns to the barbaric era and chaotic state before the birth of modern civilization, has already exceeded the necessary laws of literature and life, and has already played a role in eroding and dissipating the vitality and charm of literature itself, let alone the fact that the setting of this literary "goal" itself lacks a scientific basis.

Indeed, literature does not exclude sexual descriptions, and in some cases, sexual descriptions are inevitable and unavoidable. However, our barbaric-type sexual description works obviously lack a sense of self-awareness and self-control, almost uncontrollably revealing shallow, vulgar, savage, low, and rampant traces, blindly expressing the natural instinct and original reproductive power of life and the worship and admiration of sexual consciousness and sexual behavior, blindly severing the natural connection between sexual instinct and the times, life, civilization, and morality. Of course, this phenomenon is only a part of the literary landscape of the new era. Even so, the price we pay is still heavy! Especially when we see that the authors who once contributed warm-hearted and inspiring works to the new era literary scene with full passion and pure feelings, uplifting spirits and clear attitudes, have been swept away by the so-called "new wave" and "barbarism," and even their pens have deviated, writing works that are not quite in tune with our times, we often have an indescribable sorrow. We cannot help but deeply feel their waste and squandering of their literary talents and creative prime.

Of course, literature is not entirely unrelated to "new wave" and "barbarism." The key lies in how writers recognize it, grasp it, and express it. The process of introducing "new wave" and "barbarism" into literature is actually a rigorous process of literary selection, which is naturally also a test and examination of the writer's ideological level, literary quality, artistic expression ability, and aesthetic comprehension ability.

    文学的“新潮”与“蛮荒”
    艾斐
    新时期文学之潮头，在涌过伤痕文学、反思文学、改革文学的河段之后，就像黄河跃出龙门峡口一样，遽然撒了开去，变成无边无际的浑茫的一片，没了规范，没了主体，没了目标，顿呈千流奔突、万注宕跃之势，各自都力求在自己的趋向上找到自己的归宿，确证自己的价值。于是，文学的思维范式受到了非理性美学文本的冲击，文学的辐射状构体和多元化格局形成了。这对于开拓作家的艺术视野和改变单一的文学思维方式来说，对于充分发挥每个作家的艺术个性和造成斑斓的文学景观来说，无疑是必要的、有益的。但在具体实践过程中，由于有的作家的思想指向和艺术取向的尺度、目标和参照系，一定程度地发生了倾斜，乃至不但未能圆满地达到预期的目的，反而给文学的新生命机体造成了不应有的痞块，特别是在创作思想趋向和审美价值取向上，出现了一些混乱和迷茫。
    就中，“新潮”文学与“蛮荒”文学的次第出现和在一个时期内的日见潮涨，便是两个明显的例证。
    新潮的悖反
    “新潮”文学，就其形态和本质而言，在许多情况下，其实并非什么新潮，而是对西方现代主义文学，特别是对西方后现代主义文学诸流派的因袭和模仿，是步西方现代派文学之后尘而起的一种在美学文本和艺术方法上，都有别于中国文学的民族传统和现实主义精神的、以负载现代意识和现代心理畸变为其基本美学形态和审美追求的非理性文学。这使“新潮”文学在构建社会主义新时期文学过程中，必然要赋有某种游移性和离散性。
    从现实的创作实践作考察，相当一部分“新潮”作家虽然在其作品中显示了不平凡的文学才能，表现了难能可贵的、生气勃勃的探求精神，但若追索一下他们作品的社会意义、时代精神、思想内蕴和生活负荷，就会给人以外华内空的感觉，就会使人觉出与时代和现实的隔膜，就会使人产生迷惘的意识和沮丧的心情，就会令人发现民族文化精神的失落和传统美学力量的消泯。特别是很难从这些作品中看到“五四”以来中国新文学的内曜光彩，很难感受到革命现实主义精神、富于进取性的人性精神，和文学中的美感、道义和力量。结果造成对探求和创新的初衷与本义的违反。
    此种因果错位现象的发生，主要由于一部分“新潮”作家，在延揽“先锋”文学的过程中，态度浮躁，指向模糊，心理失重，审美主体发生了一定程度的倾斜，自觉不自觉地表现出对民族文学传统和革命文学传统的盲目贬抑，表现出对现实主义的逆向超越，表现出明显的非理性和非社会倾向，因此不可避免地与生活、与时代、与社会等，在不同层次和不同意义上发生了阻隔或断裂，造成了文学的片面回归自身和单纯符号化倾向，以及作品主题的迷惘和形式的荒诞，无形之中把文学的思想涵蕴和美学形态，与人们的意识期冀和美学情趣拉远了，与生活和时代所负载于文学的社会责任感拉远了。
    正是在这种逐渐“拉远”的过程中，旨在驾驭时代文学潮头的“先锋”作家们，在自己的创作道路上，出现了主体意向与客体效应的逆向运动。至少在其某个阶段或某些作品的创作中，表现了这种倾向和迹象。有些作家是具有创作活力和探索精神的，但相当一部分“新潮”作家的“探索型”作品中，却并没有什么独特的创造，更鲜有只属于自己的独特的发现。它们往往是在对民族文学传统和现实主义精神的摒弃中，是在对作家的时代使命感和文学的社会意义的消融中，对隶属于西方现代主义文学范畴的黑色幽默、象征主义、表现主义、超现实主义、荒诞派、意识流、意象主义等的刻意摹仿。
    当然，从西方现代主义文学中有指向有选择地吸收一些对我们有用且有益的艺术营养，完全是必要的和必须的。但，这种吸收必须是经过选择和升华的，必须是对我有用和有益的，必须是充分理解和真正融会的，不能以消泯社会主义文学的现实主义精神和社会责任感、摒弃文学的传统美学品格和民族艺术个性为代价。否则，就从根本上违逆了“汲收”和“探索”的初衷与本义。
    无须讳言，一部分“新潮”文学之所以始终摆不脱西方现代主义的影子，始终走不出文学的象牙之塔，始终只能在一个很狭窄的圈子里俯仰沉浮，这不能说不是一个很重要的原因。
    蛮荒的误区
    在美学文本上与“新潮”文学相一致，而在艺术形态上却又与“新潮”文学相对立的，是文学中的“蛮荒”现象，亦即“蛮荒”文学。
    所谓“蛮荒”，自然含有野蛮落荒的意思。但对“蛮荒”文学来说，其本义却并不仅仅止于此。在更本质的意义上，它是指从现代文明向图腾时代的倒退，它是指人性向兽性的归复，是指对一种早已被历史湮没、被时代超越、被现实淘汰了的浑沌蒙昧状的初民意识和原始世相的发掘与留恋。
    在“新潮”涌动的无定向、无秩序的多元文学格局中，这种现象是明显的、突出的，甚至成为一种趋向、一个“热点”。有相当一些立意表现文化寻根的作品，其美学文本往往都沉浸在对民族历史和民族精神的负面的张扬与玩赏上，而对民族历史和民族精神的脊梁，却人为地予以掩埋和摒弃，仿佛只有加西亚·马尔克斯和他的《百年孤独》，才堪为文化寻根小说的永具魅力的文学范本。其实，一个民族有一个民族的文化的
  “根”，其形态与内涵都是大不一样的。以我们中华民族而言，虽然也有类似阿Q那样的精神重负，但更有羿射九日、女娲补天、大禹治水那样的阳刚之气和浩然大度，即使是在清代中叶以前，中国无论在经济上，抑或在文化上，都堪称为世界强国，中国灿烂的古代文明，不就至今仍被世界上许多国家作为实现经济起飞而不可或缺的精神因素而加以弘扬和应用么？
    然而，在我们的一些文化寻根的作品中，几乎看不到这些。所看到的只是落后、愚昧、顽劣、庸懒，一大批作品，所构建和所追求的，就基本上是这样的美学文本。即使是在一些写得相当成功的作品中，有时也像是遏制不住似地露出了这样的痕迹，现实生活中早已绝迹的或者偶有残存的生活和意识负面，在文学作品中却被着意勾沉、开挖、强化和放大，乃至随心所欲地进行杜撰和编造。这当然不是忠于生活、忠于历史，而是迁就于作家的主体意象和感觉。由于这些并非就是历史和生活的本质，所以作家的迁就便必然造成文学的误区。
    兴趣和旨向在于对原始的野蛮、历史的秽迹和人性的负面，是对文学的本义和使命的曲解！任何文学，如果不以发现和表现生活与人性的美为主旨，不以生活大潮和时代精神作为其审美创造的基点和目标，不能给人以激情、理智、良知和力量，不能使人心灵得到纯化、思想得到升华，并不断地把人们引向新的更高一层的生活境界和精神境界，不能在艺术汁液中浸透历史的脊梁、民族的灵魂和生活的趋向，那就会失去文学自身所赋有的价值和意义，而使文学在本质上变得不再是文学了。在“蛮荒”文学中，有的作家就正是在这一点上出了偏差。他们把顾及两面变成了顾及一面，即只顾及历史的这一面，而且是这一面中的负面。尽管这类“蛮荒”文学被划归为“文化寻根派”之中，但诉诸于纸面的却常常是鄙陋的人格、粗蛮的举动、蒙昧的意识，乃至枭首剥皮、兽欲野性之类。
    野蛮的兽性的性描写，是蛮荒文学中的一个热点。这个“热点”的兴起，据说是为了唤起崇高的生命本能，贬抑社会的理性倾向，展示传统文化的血缘纽带所带给人性的束缚，振奋生殖崇拜的原始神威和性本能的原始冲动，从而实现对人性本能的复归和对民族生命的更新！且不说这个文学“目标”本身所具有的科学性究竟有多少，仅就为了实现这个“目标”而不惜在观念意向上返回蛮荒的史前期，返回个体生命直觉，返回浑朴民俗和自然原野，返回现代文明分娩前的蛮荒时代和混沌世相而言，就已经超出了文学的同时也超出了生活的必然规律，就已经对文学自身的生命活力与魅力起着消泯和耗散的作用了，更何况这个文学“目标”的设置本身，就是缺乏科学基础的。
    诚然，文学并不排斥性描写，甚至在有些情况下性描写是必然的和不可避免的。但是，我们的一些蛮荒型的性描写的作品，显然缺乏一种自觉性和自制力，几乎是不可抑制地流露出了浅薄、粗鄙、野蛮、卑下和狂滥的痕迹，盲目地表现对生命的自然本能和原始生殖力的渲染与崇拜，盲目地表现性意识和性行为的蛮荒与野性，盲目地割裂性本能与时代、生活、文明、道德的天然联系。当然，这种现象只是新时期文学景观的局部。即使如此，我们所付出的代价也仍然是惨重的！特别是当我们看到曾以饱满的激情和纯真的感情、向上的精神和鲜明的态度，为新时期文坛奉献过暖人心、励人志的佳作的作者们，纷纷被所谓的“新潮”和“蛮荒”席卷而去，乃至手中的笔发生了倾斜，写出了与我们的时代不大合调的作品时，我们常常有一种说不出的悲苦，我们不能不深感他们对自己的文学才能和创作旺盛期的浪费和虚掷。
    自然，文学与“新潮”和“蛮荒”并不是绝对无缘的。关键在于作家如何认识它、把握它、表现它。引“新潮”和“蛮荒”入文学的过程，实际上是一个严峻的文学选择的过程，这自然也是对作家的思想水平、文学素质、艺术表现能力和审美概括能力的检验与考验。
