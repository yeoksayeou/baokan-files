Since March, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou (Beijing to Zhangjiakou) Highway between Huailai and Yanqing has been experiencing frequent traffic jams due to road construction. On September 2nd in the afternoon, I boarded a coal truck from my unit departing from Datong. By the morning of the 3rd at 6 AM, we had passed through Xuanhua and reached the New Baoshan Town in Huailai County. The road began to get congested, and it wasn't until 7 PM that we entered the Yanqing area. A 100-kilometer journey took a full 13 hours. Along the way, I saw thousands of vehicles moving forward like ox-carts. Especially in the northern section of Huailai County, due to a large amount of water accumulation, vehicles had to pass through as if they were boats on water. One vehicle stalled and stopped in the middle of the road due to deep water, and another truck's trailer overturned, with its cargo falling into the water. Throughout this journey, I did not see any traffic management personnel directing vehicles or maintaining order. I suggest that before the new road is completed, the temporary road should be repaired as soon as possible to improve its capacity; and timely measures should be taken to direct congested vehicles and handle traffic accidents.

　　堵车严重的路段
    3月以来，京张（北京至张家口）公路怀来至延庆段因路面施工，经常堵车。9月2日下午，我搭乘本单位拉煤车从大同出发，3日晨6时经宣化行至怀来新保安镇时，道路开始堵塞，直到下午7时才进入延庆地段。100公里的路程，整整走了13个小时。沿途见数千辆汽车像牛车一样往前挪动。尤其是怀来县北口路段，由于大量积水，汽车通过如水中行舟，有一辆汽车因水深熄火停在路中，有一辆汽车挂车倾覆，货物掉在水中。在这段行程中，始终没见交通管理人员疏导车辆，维持秩序。我建议在新路未修好前，尽快将便道修理一下，提高通过能力；及时疏导堵塞车辆，处理交通事故。
