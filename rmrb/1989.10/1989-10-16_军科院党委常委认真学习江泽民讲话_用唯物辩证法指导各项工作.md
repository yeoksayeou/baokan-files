In recent days, the standing members of the Military Science Academy Party Committee have seriously studied and discussed Jiang Zemin's important speech at the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Everyone unanimously agreed that Jiang Zemin's speech, using the viewpoints of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, scientifically summarized the past and looked forward to the future. It is a guiding document for the current work of the entire Party, a new "On Ten Major Relationships," and has great and far-reaching significance for promoting the modernization of the country and the army.

Everyone, in connection with the practice of the growth and strengthening of our Party and our army, believes that dialectical materialism is an important component of Marxist philosophy, a scientific worldview and methodology, and a treasure for guiding us from victory to victory. History and reality tell us that we must prevent the right when opposing the "left," and prevent the "left" when opposing the right, and must not go from one extreme to another. During the revolutionary war period, we initially mainly made rightist errors, and later made "leftist" errors. It was not until the Zunyi Conference and the Seventh Party Congress that we overcame both rightist and "leftist" errors, guiding the Chinese revolution to continuous victory. After the founding of New China, for the first 30 years, we continuously opposed the right, resulting in mainly "leftist" errors. In the past ten years of reform and opening up, we neglected the adherence to the four cardinal principles, and both spiritual and material civilizations were weak, with the spread of bourgeois liberalization thought becoming an important cause of the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. The profound lessons of the errors made by the former General Secretary remind us: only by adhering to the correct stance, viewpoint, and method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and always paying attention to one tendency covering another, adhering to the two-point theory, can we better grasp the objective laws of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Party Committee Secretary Wang Chenghan said: Jiang Zemin's speech is full of dialectics throughout, especially the explanation of the unity of adhering to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up and other ten major relationships is very clear, clarifying the blurred understanding of some major issues in recent years. We must consistently unify the four cardinal principles with reform and opening up dialectically, adhere to the two civilizations, and absolutely cannot be weak in one hand and strong in the other. Correctly handle the relationship between adhering to reform and opening up and preventing peaceful evolution, the relationship between adhering to the four cardinal principles and further emancipating the mind, the relationship between developing the economy and arduous struggle, the relationship between focusing on economic construction and strengthening party building, etc. In short, we must formulate policies and carry out work with dialectics, adhering to the two-point theory.

Deputy Party Secretary and President Zheng Wenhan said, the reason why Zhao Ziyang made errors on the issue of bourgeois liberalization is that he fell into rightist one-sidedness and went on the path of metaphysics from the perspective of epistemology. This lesson is profound. Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought are the theoretical foundation and guiding principles for our revolutionary cause. Especially, leading cadres must study Marxist philosophy and learn some dialectics. One worldview, one methodology, if this problem is solved, one can stand firm in the face of storms. Without mastering dialectics, one will make "leftist" and rightist errors, causing losses to the revolutionary cause. For the army, the practice of the war years has proven this. The recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing also show that in a long-term peaceful environment, especially in the new situation of focusing on economic construction, the awareness of enemy situation and class struggle cannot be weakened. The army's function is not only to defend against external invasions and protect the motherland, but also to stop turmoil and maintain stability and unity internally. Both internally and externally, we must grasp both, and we must not neglect either.

### 军科院党委常委认真学习江泽民讲话  用唯物辩证法指导各项工作

    军科院党委常委认真学习江泽民讲话
    用唯物辩证法指导各项工作
    本报讯　连日来，军事科学院党委常委认真学习讨论江泽民同志在建国40周年大会上的重要讲话。大家一致认为，江泽民同志的讲话运用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的观点科学地总结了过去，展望了未来，是指导当前全党工作的纲领性文件，是一篇新的“论十大关系”，对于推进国家和军队的现代化建设，有着十分重大而深远的意义。
    大家联系我党我军成长壮大的实践，认为唯物辩证法是马克思主义哲学的重要组成部分，是科学的世界观和方法论，是指导我们从胜利走向胜利的法宝。历史和现实的经验告诉我们，反“左”必须防右，反右必须防“左”，切忌从一个极端走向另一个极端。革命战争时期，最初主要犯了右的错误，后来又犯了“左”的错误。直到遵义会议和党的七大后克服了右的和“左”的两方面的错误，引导中国革命不断走向胜利。新中国成立后，前30年不断反右，结果主要犯了“左”的错误。最近十年搞改革开放，却忽视了坚持四项基本原则，两个文明建设也是一手软一手硬，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，成为导致前不久北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱的一个重要原因。前任总书记犯错误的深刻教训告诫我们：只有坚持辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的正确立场、观点和方法，时刻注意一种倾向掩盖另一种倾向，坚持两点论，才能更好地把握建设有中国特色的社会主义的客观规律。
    党委书记王诚汉政委指出：江总书记的讲话通篇充满着辩证法，特别是对坚持四项基本原则与坚持改革开放的统一问题等十大关系的阐述非常透彻，澄清了几年来在一些重大问题上的模糊认识。我们要始终如一地把四项基本原则与改革开放紧密地辩证地统一起来，坚持两个文明一起抓，绝不能一手硬一手软。正确处理好坚持改革开放与防止和平演变的关系，坚持四项基本原则与进一步解放思想的关系，发展经济与艰苦奋斗的关系，以经济建设为主与加强党的建设的关系等等。总之，我们制订政策、开展工作都要讲辩证法，坚持两点论。
    党委副书记郑文翰院长说，赵紫阳同志之所以在资产阶级自由化问题上犯错误，从认识论上说来是陷入了右的片面性，走到形而上学的路上去了，这个教训是深刻的。马克思主义、毛泽东思想是指导我们革命事业的理论基础和行动指南。特别是领导干部要学习马克思主义哲学，学一点辩证法。一个世界观，一个方法论，这个问题解决了，遇到风浪就能站稳立场。不掌握好辩证法，就会犯“左”的和右的错误，给革命事业带来损失。就军队来讲，战争年代的实践就证明了这一点。前不久北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱也说明，在长期和平环境特别是在以经济建设为中心的新形势下，敌情和阶级斗争观念不能淡化。军队职能不仅是对外抵御侵略、保卫祖国，而且对内也要制止动乱、维护安定团结。对内对外也要两手抓，千万忽视不得。
