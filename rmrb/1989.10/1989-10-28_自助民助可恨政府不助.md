Self-Help and Public Assistance, Government Indifference

New China News Agency reporter Lù Wényuè

On October 14, the Washington Post published a news item: Due to the city government's announcement that rents would be significantly increased starting in November, an 88-year-old woman named Marble, who has lived in a public housing apartment in the Northeast District of the capital for 29 years, will see her monthly rent rise from $265 to $572. She and her 17-year-old grandson will be forced to live on the streets because they cannot afford the rent.

Marble had applied to the city government for housing subsidies. She said that if the government provided her with a $300 monthly subsidy, she and her grandson could continue to live in the four-bedroom apartment. Including social security and her income from working 20 hours a week, Marble earns $940 a month. After paying $572 in rent, the remaining money is not enough to support the two of them. Marble's grandson moved in with her after his mother passed away.

However, the government's response was: Although Marble's situation is indeed pitiful, the government is unable to assist her. The city's public housing department issued a statement on the 20th explaining that Washington currently has nearly 9,500 families waiting for city housing subsidies. These families all have incomes below the poverty line and need a two-bedroom apartment, with rent accounting for more than half of their income. In comparison, Marble's situation is not the worst, so she is ranked 484th on the waiting list. This means Marble will have to wait two years before receiving assistance. The director of the city's public housing department, Turpin, said he "sympathizes with Marble's situation, but cannot give her special treatment because most applicants are also asking for special treatment."

The incident also caught the attention of the Federal Housing Department. However, an official from that department said the Federal Housing Department does not have the authority to provide Marble with rent subsidies and that the matter should be directed to the city government.

After a week, the Washington Post finally published a reassuring piece of news on the 21st: More than 50 people in the city contacted the newspaper, asking it to appeal for help for Marble to get out of her predicament. So far, Marble has received $4,000 in donations, temporarily alleviating her risk of losing her home. This $4,000 can only help her get through her immediate difficulties.

Marble's story at least illustrates one aspect of why, in the bustling streets of Washington, in parks, and even on the lawn in front of the White House, one can see groups of homeless people begging and sleeping rough. According to statistics, Washington has tens of thousands of homeless people.

### 自助民助可恨政府不助

　　自助民助可恨政府不助
　　新华社记者　陆文岳
    10月14日，《华盛顿邮报》刊出一则消息：由于市政府宣布从11月起大幅度提高房租，在首都东北区一所公寓住了29年的88岁老妇玛卜尔的房租每月将从265美元增至572美元，她和她的17岁外孙将因付不起房租而流落街头。
    玛卜尔曾向市政府申请过住房补贴。她说，市政府只须每月补助她300美元，她和外孙就能继续住那四居室房子。包括社会保险金和她每周工作20小时的收入，玛卜尔每月收入940美元。扣除572美元房租后余下的钱无法养活祖孙两人。玛卜尔的外孙是因母亲去世而投靠外婆的。
    然而政府部门的答复是：虽然玛卜尔的处境确实可怜，但政府爱莫能助。市府公共住房部在20日发表的声明中解释说，华盛顿现在有近9500家排队等候市府的住房补贴，这些家庭的收入都在贫困线以下，他们都需要一套两居室房子，而房租都占收入的一半以上。相形之下，玛卜尔的境况不算最差，因此排位484号，这意味着玛卜尔要等两年后才能获得补助。市政府公共住房部主任图尔品说，他“很同情玛卜尔的处境，但不能因此特殊照顾她，因为大多数申请人都在要求特殊照顾。”
    此事也惊动了联邦住房部。但该部的一位官员说，联邦住房部没有权力向玛卜尔提供房租补助，此事应找市政府。
    事隔一周，《华盛顿邮报》终于在21日登出一条可以令人宽慰的消息：该市50多人向该报联系，要求该报呼吁帮助玛卜尔摆脱困境。到目前为止，玛卜尔已经收到4000美元的捐助，暂时无失去寓所之虞。这4000美元只能帮助她暂度难关。
    玛卜尔的故事至少从一个侧面说明：为什么在华盛顿闹市区的街角和公园里，甚至在白宫面前的草坪上，人们可以看到成群的流浪者在乞讨和露宿。据统计，华盛顿的无家可归者达数万之多。
