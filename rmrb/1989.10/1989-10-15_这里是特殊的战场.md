On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I visited the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation to see how it had changed over the 30-plus years since its establishment. I remember my first visit to Daye in 1954, when the mines were just being surveyed and the site for the steel plant had not yet been chosen. In 1955, on my second visit, construction had begun at Qing Shan. In 1956, the thermal power plant rose from the ground; in 1958, the blast furnace produced iron; in 1959, the first furnace produced steel. Thirty years later, in 1989, I don't remember how many times I had visited, but I saw incredible changes!

The manager of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's First Steel Plant (hereafter referred to as "First Steel Plant"), Xu Bingxin, and the former head of the plant's propaganda department, Yao Chuanghong, accompanied the poet Li Shengming and me, a group of four, as we walked along a high, bridge-like, long corridor.

Looking north from the height, I saw four peculiar, sculpture-like blast furnaces standing tall and proud in the vast sky, along with their towering chimneys. The sintering plant and an even taller chimney stood to their east. There was no thick smoke billowing out, only wispy dust rising gently. This reminded me of the early days of the founding of the nation, when I was at Anshan Steel. I saw the sky over the Tiexi District covered in thick clouds, thinking it was about to rain, and I quickly took shelter under an eave. But it was just the smoke from the coking, iron-making, steel-making, and sintering furnaces. Now, in the last year of the 1980s, we have been building our nation for 40 years.

During the Cultural Revolution, it was said that to smash Wuhan, you had to smash Wuhan Steel; to smash Wuhan Steel, you had to smash the First Steel Plant. As a result, all the steel-making furnaces were shut down and could not produce, only maintaining heat. The chimneys did not emit smoke, and "birds nested on the chimneys of the open-hearth furnaces." But now, the chimneys emit very little smoke. The smoke is sucked into the dust-collecting equipment. One day, when technology advances further, the chimneys will be removed.

I turned around and looked down at the other side of the corridor. To the south, a vast and magnificent scene unfolded. The view from above was truly astonishing. A magnificent image lay flat on the deep, long strip of the workshop floor! Although it was dizzying, it was also clear and refreshing, and the more I looked, the more beautiful it became.

The long workshop seemed to be in the dark under the shade. There were indicator lights and strong beams of light flashing here and there, illuminating moving shapes. Below, there were rows of trains, and above, there were overhead cranes. They moved up and down, lifting, loading, pouring, and towing various large ladles and ingot molds, engaged in tense and lively work. There were shadows of people, but not many, just agile and flexible movements.

"This is the ingot casting workshop," Yao Chuanghong said. Suddenly, he pointed to the distance and exclaimed, "Look, the seventh open-hearth furnace has started pouring steel." As he spoke, the ingot casting workshop was bathed in even stronger light, and a louder roar could be heard.

What a clean, patterned workshop!

What a rare composition, capturing the heart with its colors!

I couldn't believe that the vast expanse before me, which seemed to be forever untidy and impassable, was now so orderly. Various giant steel water ladles, slag ladles, hot and cold empty ladles, and hundreds of ingot molds, after demolding, sorting, and cooling, stood like soldiers ready for battle, fully armed and awaiting the baptism of steel flames. They all stood at their posts. Above them, 350-ton giant gantry cranes (nine in total) moved and glided, while locomotive heads pulling slag ladles and red ingots shuttled back and forth between them. I remember that in the past, the scene was particularly chaotic, with items scattered everywhere, slag piles piled high, and sometimes it seemed impossible to walk through. But now, the impression it gave me was so extraordinary: extraordinarily neat, arranged in perfect order, not chaotic at all, completely like a disciplined formation, ready for battle at any moment.

In the distance, the pouring steel, with its white-hot glow, added a layer of fiery red light to the scene. I wanted to lean on the railing to take a closer look, but Xu Bingxin said, "We'll look at it later. First, let's go see the open-hearth furnace." Li Shengming also said, "Right," and came over to support me. He said, "You should first see the head, then the body, and finally the tail. Then you can see the back and the front." The poet's language was unique, very witty, and full of meaning. Seeing the back and then the front was a reference to my past experience of sitting by the train window, watching the rotating fields of Jiangnan, a lyrical line of poetry.

We continued forward, talking as we walked. Soon, we reached the end of the corridor. Turning a corner, we found ourselves in the open-hearth furnace workshop.

Here, three long workshops stood side by side. From a horizontal view: the raw material workshop is the so-called "head"; the open-hearth furnace workshop is the so-called "body"; the ingot casting workshop is the so-called "tail." All three extend southward from this long corridor. We first went to the open-hearth furnace workshop, which is 482 meters long and seems to have no end. But I only saw the first and third open-hearth furnaces. In front of the third furnace, there was a large machine, which I didn't know if it was a slag-removing machine, charging machine, or furnace-repairing machine. It blocked the view of the four furnaces behind it and the furnace door of the third furnace.

When my gaze focused on the first open-hearth furnace, Department Head Yao leaned in and said, "Let's first look at the raw material workshop, the 'head.' This way, you'll know how a furnace of steel is made." To see the head and tail clearly, he led me to the mixing furnace at the front of the raw material workshop. This mixing furnace stood tall and proud, with three layers and a height of over 20 meters, capable of storing 1,300 tons of molten iron. It was like a giant god, standing at the head of the steel plant. There was another similar mixing furnace at the southern end of the workshop. I asked about their functions, and Yao Chuanghong said, "One is to maintain heat, two is to store, and it can also mix different compositions of molten iron, exclusively for use in steel-making furnaces."

Just as we were gazing up at this giant structure, a 125-ton gantry crane lifted a molten iron ladle, glowing with sparks, from the iron-making plant and lowered it into the mixing furnace with its mouth facing the sky. Then it tilted and poured a golden-red waterfall-like golden dragon into the mixing furnace. This way, they could supply the open-hearth furnace with molten iron at any time. What a magnificent production scene!

Before we knew it, our group had arrived in front of the first open-hearth furnace. Yao Chuanghong continued, "Open-hearth steel-making is a 24-hour continuous process, so the molten steel inevitably erodes the furnace body. The first step in steel-making is furnace repair. Then, the second step is to add limestone, iron ore, scrap steel, and some auxiliary fluxes, and then add molten iron for smelting."

This was quite complex, and I only understood a little. But I saw one scene after another, more magnificent than any artist's creation, completely real. This was something that even the most imaginative writer could not imagine. All of this was the most magnificent picture. When I looked up, I saw the molten iron from the ladle being poured into the mixing furnace, then flowing out of the mixing furnace and into the open-hearth furnace; then, the oxygen-blown open-hearth furnace refined it into molten steel, which was truly magnificent; then the molten steel was cast into steel ingots; these steel ingots were sent to the initial rolling mill; after rolling, they were sent to other rolling mills.

What a magnificent sight! A symphony of heroes! A grand gallery of modern industrial scenes!

At this moment, the first open-hearth furnace was roaring and bellowing. The smelting had begun, but the molten steel had not yet boiled. The open-hearth furnace was as spacious as a not very large five-bay flat-roofed house, its appearance was not outstanding, but its spirit was soaring. There were three oxygen-blown pipes on its top and five furnace doors on its walls. Each furnace door had a round hole. Now, flames were spewing out of the furnace doors and round holes, violet-colored flames. The colors were ever-changing. But all flame dances were extremely beautiful. The flames were arranged in neat rows, like a troupe of ballet dancers, their shadows dancing. The enormous storm-like roar accompanied their light and agile movements.

Since smelting takes a considerable amount of time (previously it took sixteen or seventeen hours, now it has been shortened to just over six hours), the workers spent this time observing and waiting. Xu Bingxin took the opportunity to tell me a story:

"The First Steel Plant was designed by the Soviet Union and put into operation in 1959. This year marks its 30th anniversary. The first phase of the project consisted of six open-hearth furnaces, two of which were 250 tons and four of which were 500 tons. In the early 1970s, we built two more 500-ton furnaces. A total of eight! But for many years, we swore and vowed to produce 200 million tons of steel per year. It was always a case of things not going as planned. Why? First, the equipment was outdated. How could equipment from the 1950s produce steel to the standards of the 1980s? Second, we were not very willing to carry out technical renovations on the open-hearth furnaces, thinking that open-hearth furnaces were soon to be phased out, and it was not cost-effective to renovate them. So, some people criticized us for not letting go of the open-hearth furnaces. But honestly, who doesn't want to see their factory modernized? But funds are limited. However, the old plant still has a lot of potential to be tapped. In 1983, we renovated the first furnace, turning it into a 500-ton oxygen-blown open-hearth furnace. At the beginning of the renovation, people said we were 'cutting off the head' of the First Steel Plant. They thought we would not succeed and might even destroy the First Steel Plant. Even if we succeeded, the production volume would not increase. But it succeeded, and the production volume doubled. The investment of 25 million yuan was recovered in two and a half years. The first furnace has indeed made a significant contribution to Wuhan Steel."

I felt a surge of excitement and joy: what a great first furnace!

I dare say that anyone standing in front of the open-hearth furnace will inevitably feel a surge of heroic spirit. At this moment, I had that feeling again. My joys and sorrows, anger and sadness, all disappeared, and I only saw the open-hearth furnace, the flames burning fiercely, and my heart also had a scorching heat. Beam after beam of intense light, roar after roar of storm-like noise, they filled my soul. There were a few steel workers standing calmly in front of the furnace, observing the condition inside the furnace through blue glasses. These figures illuminated by the flames were so moving, wearing light gray coarse cotton work clothes, they looked more beautiful than marble statues!

Yao Chuanghong saw that the plant manager was talking to the steel workers and whispered to me, "Our plant manager is a graduate of a technical school. He started as a furnace worker, then became a second assistant, a first assistant, then a furnace supervisor, then a chief furnace supervisor, then a workshop director, then a deputy plant manager, and in 1984 he became the plant manager, and now he is also the party secretary. He has come up step by step, solidly. Before he entered the plant, he graduated from the Anshan Iron and Steel Industrial School, and then studied at a night school. Now he is not only a qualified leader but also an expert in steel-making."

At this time, Xu Bingxin returned, and we moved forward to the third furnace. Li Shengming seemed to be inspired by poetry and suggested to me, "From the first furnace to the third furnace, it is from 1983 to 1984." This was the poet's language, taking a big detour and jumping. This I understood; he was referring to the renovated furnace and the year of renovation, placing the two side by side.

Xu Bingxin said, "Yes, in 1983, the first furnace was renovated, and it was said that we were 'cutting off the head'; in 1984, the third furnace was renovated, and someone said we were 'cutting off the main workshop.' This brought us even more unimaginable difficulties: because during the entire renovation period, we had to cut the main workshop of the First Steel Plant in half. In the middle, we placed a construction team, and both ends still had to produce. This blocked the north and south, and if the production and construction were not organized properly, both would be affected. We demanded 'two no delays': renovation ahead of schedule, and production still had to exceed. So, we worked day and night for three months, and the third furnace was put into operation. The production volume increased significantly in the first year. That year, the total production of the First Steel Plant reached 230 million tons, which was something we had been trying to achieve since 1979 but had not been able to. Finally, we did it. And since then, this plant has been able to increase production by about 20 million tons each year. In 1988, we reached 265 million tons. This year, due to a slight decline in raw material supply, production decreased. We took the initiative to demand that in the second half of the year, we would increase production to 144 million tons (the annual total would be 288 million tons). Productivity has indeed increased. We are now making the necessary preparations so that in the 1990s, production will gradually reach 300 million tons of steel. Now we can produce over 200 kinds of steel. The quality has passed inspection, and it is no longer the joke of 'democratic steel-making' and 'free ingot casting,' where whatever steel is made is considered steel. Now it is strictly according to the contract, whatever steel is ordered, we will produce that steel."

As he said this, I felt a mix of emotions, thinking: they really did a great job!

Just now, I thought that the giant machine in front of the third furnace was a slag-removing machine, but now, upon closer inspection, I found that it was not. It was exactly a furnace-repairing machine, used to repair the furnace lining during smelting. Xu Bingxin borrowed a pair of blue glasses from a furnace worker and let me wear them, letting me go to the furnace to see the condition of the furnace repair. I saw it. Not only did I see the magnesium sand spraying out of the nozzle, but more importantly, I saw the burning, boiling molten steel. It was so dazzling that if I had not been wearing blue glasses, I would not have been able to see this magnificent scene in the high temperature of nearly 1600 degrees Celsius.

We moved forward and passed through an open area. I looked a bit puzzled, and Xu Bingxin spoke up:

"There used to be a fourth furnace here, and there was also a second furnace over there. After the technical renovation, we found that we did not need so many furnaces, so we dismantled them. Now, the First Steel Plant has six furnaces: one, three, five, six, eight, and seven (the sequence is not in order, but in the order of construction time, it is like this)."

Then, Xu Bingxin began to tell me about the renovation of the fifth furnace in 1985:

"According to the plan, the fifth furnace was the last to be renovated. We did not want to renovate the sixth furnace. But the renovation encountered difficulties: first, the sixth furnace had a material car line that had to pass in front of the fifth furnace. This problem was not solved, so the sixth furnace had to stop production during the renovation of the fifth furnace, which would affect the completion of the annual production plan; second, the renovation period was too long. From the production perspective, the renovation period should be as short as possible. This way, the guarantee of completing the annual production task would be greater. However, these two problems, the relevant departments said, were difficult to solve. If the fifth furnace was to be renovated, then the sixth furnace would inevitably have to stop production, and the construction period would be difficult to advance.

"Human memory can really help a lot. Suddenly, I remembered that the material car line of the sixth furnace could be rerouted. I had even seen the blueprint of this material car line back then. When I proposed this to the relevant departments, they found it troublesome and did not want to accept it. At that time, we were really anxious, but what could we do? We could only beg them: I said, you have difficulties, we will do it, do you agree? Because we are not the design department, we should not do large-scale design. The relevant departments finally helped us out. They said, 'You can do it,' and they would take responsibility. That was great.

"I am a bit 'greedy' when it comes to work. Since we had to make a big fuss over a material car line, why not use this renovation as an opportunity for a more thorough renovation? Why not turn the oil-fired open-hearth furnace into a dual-gun oxygen-blown furnace and borrow an extra electrostatic precipitator from the eighth furnace. It doesn't cost much money, and it can increase production and improve the environment. Such a good thing, why not do it? We decided to renovate the sixth furnace first and then the fifth furnace. With the approval of the company's general manager Huang Mobi and chief engineer Zhang Shourong, we started the work.

"To be honest, production was already very tense, and this added the task of self-renovating the sixth furnace, making everyone breathless. I found workshop directors and department heads to assign key personnel to do this work, but they all said they couldn't spare them. I knew their difficulties and psychology. But what could I do? I had to 'force' their 'army.' I said, okay, if you don't let them go, I'll take you first, and I'll replace your work. Our comrades are so good! As long as you explain it clearly, no matter how big the difficulty, they are willing to take it on. As a result, we immediately assigned more than 40 key personnel. There was Hu Guoqiao, the deputy director of the equipment department, a graduate of Tongji University; there was Zhou Bingwen, a senior technician, a vice-director of the equipment factory, who was a provincial-level technical expert and actually became the temporary chief designer; there was Ma Shannin, a thermal energy engineer; and Zheng Longjian, who was not in good health but came to work despite his illness, full of enthusiasm; and Kang Gang, who looked very elegant and did not talk much, but when he did, he spoke very accurately. In addition, there was You Yanlin, who was responsible for the structural design of the furnace and was a skilled old worker; Zhao Mingchen, who was responsible for the design of the oxygen lance and pipeline... It was these people who fought for more than a month, and the sixth furnace renovation was successful, exceeding our expected results. Immediately after that, the renovation of the fifth furnace began. This time, the official designers and regular construction teams went up."

This speech was very moving. The two furnaces in front of me came to life.

Department Head Yao commented, "Our plant manager has a long-term plan. He has had the goal of 280 million tons and 300 million tons for a long time."

Li Shengming saw that I was very excited and came up with an idea. He suggested that we go to see the eighth furnace, "Come on, to the eighth furnace, our plant manager's most brilliant story is at the eighth furnace."

"Really?" I asked.

Department Head Yao answered, "Really."

We went to the eighth furnace and entered the operating room. It faced the furnace, and inside were various automated devices and instruments. The furnace supervisor was on the phone, and the laboratory was reporting the results of the chemical analysis of the molten steel sample. I asked how many workers were in one shift at the furnace? A worker answered, "Eleven." Not many people, but the labor intensity was indeed very large, making me admire them. But I thought I should return to my question.

"What is the most brilliant story?" I asked Department Head Yao again.

Xu Bingxin said, "There is no brilliant story. Don't believe them. The eighth furnace has a composite furnace bottom. What they are talking about is this furnace bottom. Of course, the furnace bottom is the most important. If the furnace bottom leaks molten steel, that would be a major accident. If an explosion occurs, it would be a major accident. Now, open-hearth steel-making is gradually being replaced by converter steel-making, but open-hearth steel-making has not been completely phased out. The number of open-hearth furnaces in our country is decreasing, but the steel production is still significant. There are not many large-scale oxygen-blown open-hearth furnaces, but the oxygen intensity is continuously increasing, making the problem of furnace bottom erosion very serious. In recent years, we have been constantly studying the furnace bottom problem and have conducted many experiments. I won't go into detail about the technology. The idea of using the so-called 'composite furnace bottom' began at the end of 1983. By the end of 1985, a specific furnace bottom construction and a combination of 'assisted sintering and self-sintering' were successfully used on the eighth furnace. The effect was very good. After two and a half years, 1702 furnaces of steel were smelted, and after one inspection, it was found that the bonded material had become an integral layer, the upper part of the standing magnesium bricks and the sintered layer had fused into one, and the lower part of the bricks was intact. If you are interested, I have a few papers that I can give you, but they are not brilliant stories, just very dry technical materials." He laughed as he said this.

I said, "This is still very brilliant. I hope to be able to read your papers."

"When I went to Canada to inspect, I asked about their furnace bottoms and their achievements. In fact, we had already solved the problem, but I asked anyway. They said they had excellent results and blueprints. If you want them, they cost 30,000 dollars. Thirty thousand! I didn't buy them, but from this, I knew that our achievement was worth 30,000 dollars just for the blueprints." He laughed.

At this time, the furnace workers were taking samples. The furnace supervisor in the duty room, with a wave of the furnace worker's hand, opened a furnace door. Suddenly, it was as if a sun had risen from the horizon, blinding my eyes. This steel worker, holding a long ladle like a spear, stood at the scorching furnace door, scooped up a ladle of molten steel, and placed the long ladle on the ground. Many sparks flew, like golden flowers dancing. I ran to a place not far from there and saw him pour out a small round cake, which he placed in a pipe opening. They said this was a high-pressure wind tunnel, which could immediately blow it to the laboratory. In a moment, its chemical composition would be reported to the operating room. After several samplings and analyses, when the composition of the molten steel was qualified, it could be poured out.

At the furnace, I had almost understood every furnace, and I felt as if I had entered an enchanting tourist attraction. It was like visiting the Palace of Versailles on the outskirts of Paris, France, or the White House in Washington, D.C. But this was completely different. This was a place of power. Your feeling in front of the furnace was the boiling molten steel and your own boiling blood combined. You thought of contributing yourself, not enjoying the best enjoyment in the world. You only felt spiritually uplifted, only felt guilty, but not depressed, but full of confidence, filled with full, optimistic emotions. Under this emotion, you would feel that our future is extremely brilliant.

The time for the eighth furnace to pour steel arrived. I was taken to a long corridor in the ingot casting workshop that faced the furnace, where there was a small platform specially designed for observing the pouring. The entire scene unfolded before my eyes. It was the 682-meter-long ingot casting workshop, like a long scroll unfolding before us. We waited, watching the workers loading the cannon. They said that there was a military factory that specially made shells for blowing open the pouring port of the open-hearth furnace for the steel plant. We waited for a while.

When the time came, sure enough, a cannon shot rang out, and immediately a beam of white light flashed, pouring down two streams of molten steel from two slots. The light was dazzling, and steel sparks flew endlessly, like a rain of flowers from the sky, or like the goddess scattering flowers. Perhaps the most beautiful thing to see was the flying steel sparks, like fireworks on a festive occasion, even more beautiful than fireworks.

But Li Shengming said, "Although the flying golden steel sparks look beautiful, in fact, they are just slag, also called steel slag, and are actually worthless." Although now even the slag has its uses, he coldly added, "Not everything that shines is steel. Be careful not to be fooled."

What a poet! These words were meaningful, and I couldn't help but applaud him in my heart.

From the two slots, two streams of brilliant light poured down, jumping into two giant molten steel ladles. I did not feel this was different from Li Bai's poem "It seems like the Milky Way falls from the ninth heaven." I felt that this was more like: "When the sun climbs to the zenith, then the ruler of all things takes out his golden scales." He puts the fate of the country and the production of steel "on both sides, he lifts the beam of the scales," if the weight of steel is light, the fate of the country will "bow down and sink"; if the steel production is very heavy, the fate of the country will rise, "reaching the sky." This was a line from the famous poem in the Greek epic "Iliad" that I had once translated. It was also very beautiful and meaningful.

I found that I was at the center of a great industrial hub. It was not only an intermediate workshop in the continuous operation line of Wuhan Steel, but also the center of the continuous operation line of the national industry, and the most critical link. I told Xu Bingxin this meaning, and he said, "Yes, someone has said that this is a special battlefield!"

I was solemn, and my heart immediately cheered, asking him how he understood this sentence.

He replied to me, "On the open-hearth furnace platform, it is also a matter of seconds. It is also a place of life and death, survival and extinction. Look, the upper, middle, and lower three levels of battle, like the coordination of the army, navy, and air force. Only victory is allowed, and no mistakes can be made. If a country has no steel, it cannot talk about national defense. Without a strong national defense, nothing can be talked about, and the people will lose their shield of safety."

His words also made me excited. This is a "special battlefield!" It is related to the production of steel. It decides the strength of the country, the fate of the nation, and the happiness of the people.

Today, the oxygen-blown open-hearth furnace should also be one of the peaks of national life, even one of the peaks of industrial literature, industrial aesthetics, and industrial poetry. It should stand side by side with scientific literature, scientific aesthetics, and scientific poetry.

Now I really want to know, what is the use of Wuhan Steel's steel? What role does it play?

Department Head Yao gave me three of Xu Bingxin's furnace bottom papers before I left, and also gave me a book, "Annals of the First Steel Plant." From it, I saw such a passage: "Wuhan Steel's steel is used in the Beijing subway, the Yellow River defense bridge, the offshore oil drilling platform in the Bohai Sea, the Guangzhou TV tower, the Fierce River Hydropower Station, the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, the Daging, Fenglei, Fengbao, and Changfeng distant ocean-going ships. The Fengguang has sailed through the Mediterranean Sea, the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, passed through six straits, circled the Cape of Good Hope twice, passed through the equatorial zone four times, traveled 32,000 nautical miles, and fought with ten-meter-high waves for three days and nights, and returned safely."

Of course, there are many other uses, which are not mentioned in this book. From this, it can be known that this is indeed a special battlefield of no small significance. Think about it, a steel plant, six furnaces, producing more than 200 million to 300 million tons of steel per year, what kind of battlefield is this? I have not even mentioned the Second Steel Plant, as well as the Third Steel Plant that is being planned... and the famous 'One Point Seven' rolling system... the rolling mill... this special battlefield!

专栏：国庆报告文学征文

    这里是特殊的战场
    徐迟
    在国庆40周年前夕，我到武汉钢铁公司，想去看看它建厂以来30多年来的变化。记得我1954年第一次去大冶，矿山甫在勘探，武钢的厂址尚未选定；1955年第二次去，青山开始推土平地。1956年热电厂拔地而起；1958年高炉出铁；1959年第一炉钢出钢。30年后，1989年已弄不清楚第几次来了，我看到了何等样的变化呵！
    武汉钢铁公司第一炼钢厂（以下简称“一炼钢”）厂长徐秉新和原任的厂宣传部长姚传洪，陪着诗人李声明和我一行四人，走上了一条高架的、桥形的、长长的走廊。
    登高而北望兮，见苍茫穹窿间，雄峙着四只奇特如立体型的雕塑的高炉和它们的高耸的烟囱。而烧结厂和一个更高的烟囱，就挺立在它们东面。却没有滚滚的浓烟了，只有一缕缕轻尘袅袅。使我一下子想起了开国之初，我在鞍钢，但见铁西区上空乌云弥漫，以为大雨将至，似乎顷刻间即将激发出电闪雷震，我赶快躲避在一个屋檐下。其实，这不过是从炼焦的焦炉、炼铁的高炉、炼钢的平炉和烧结厂等厂子的烟囱里喷出来的腾腾烟雾。现在是80年代最后的一年了，我们建国已40周年。
    “文革”的时候，说是要砸烂武汉，就得砸烂武钢；要砸烂武钢，就得砸烂一炼钢。结果是所有的炼钢炉子，都不能生产，竟然全部停产，只能保温。烟囱不冒烟，“飞鸟在平炉烟囱上作了窝”。而现在，却又要尽量的“少”出烟了。现在的烟囱确实只出非常之少的烟，烟都被吸进吸尘设备里去了。有朝一日，当技术更加突飞猛进时，将来的烟囱是要被拔掉的。
    我转过身来，俯看长廊的另一面。南面铺开了另一幅壮美景色的巨大画面。鸟瞰之下的景色之美，着实使我吃惊。一幅瑰丽的图象，平铺在一条深邃的长条子的车间地面上！虽然眼花缭乱，却又柳暗花明，越看越清爽起来，而且越看越发的美丽。
    这长条车间似在浓荫下的暗黑之中。有指示红灯以及强烈光照，忽在这儿忽在那儿闪射出光亮的形体往返来去。下面一列列的列车，上面一个个的天车。它们上上下下的吊的、装的、浇注的、拖拉的，各种各样的大罐和锭模，进行着紧张、热烈的劳动。人影闪闪，但人并不多，只是身手矫健，动作灵活。
    “这是铸锭车间，”姚传洪说。忽然他手指着远方欢呼，“呵，你看，七号平炉开始出钢了。”说话间，铸锭车间染上了更强的光芒，传来了更巨大的音响。
    多么好看、干净、图案形的车间呵！
    多么罕见的构图，抓人心弦的色彩呵！
    我真不相信面前那苍茫一片，过去似乎永远收拾不干净，走进去时常走不通。各种巨大钢水罐、钢渣罐、正在烤热和已经烤热的大空罐和数以百计的钢锭模子，经脱模、整模、冷模处理，它们已像列队出征的士兵一样，全副武装好，随时准备或正在迎接钢水烈焰的洗礼，它们都站在自己的岗位上。在这上面，正蠕动和滑翔着350吨巨型的桥式天车（一共有九台之多），而机车头拖着渣罐，铸成了的红锭在它们的中间来回穿梭。我记得从前，那里景色特别零乱，物品乱放，钢渣堆积成山，有时简直叫人觉得是无法插足的。然而现在它给我的印象竟是这样的：非凡的整齐，排列得井然有序，毫不零乱，完全像一个临阵不乱的方阵，严阵以待，随时可以迎接、投入和勇敢地战斗的。
    而在远处正出着的钢，白热光芒，又给画面染上了一层热情的火红色的耀目的光晕。我正想靠上栏杆细看，徐秉新说，“回头再看吧，先看平炉去。”李声明也说，“对了，”便过来搀扶我。他说，“应该先看头，再看腰身，最后看结尾。然后再从后影看到前身。”诗人的语言，与众不同，非常俏皮，而且话中有话。从后影看到前身，是引用我从前坐在火车窗前，观看江南的田野的旋转的，一句抒情的诗句。
    我们又举步向前，并边走边谈。说着我们已经走到长廊尽头。一拐弯，不觉已踏进了平炉车间。
    这里紧挨着的三条长长的车间，从横向看去：原料车间是所谓“头”；平炉车间是所谓“腰身”；铸锭车间是所谓“尾”。三者都从这条长廊出发，一直向南伸展。我们先到平炉车间，482米长，几乎望不到尽头。但我只看到一号和三号两个平炉。三号炉前有一台大机器，不知它是清渣机、装料机还是补炉机，挡住了它后面的四个炉子，也挡住了三号炉的炉门。
    当我的视线集中到了一号平炉时，姚部长凑到我的跟前说：“还是先看原料车间这个‘头’。这样你就知道一炉钢是怎样炼出来的。”为了看清楚头尾，他把我领到那个原料车间排头位的混铁炉旁。这座混铁炉拔地而起，又高又大。共有三层，20多米高，可存铁水1300吨，像个巨神，屹立在炼钢厂的头部。还有同样的另一座混铁炉在厂房最南端。我问它们的作用，姚传洪说：“一是保温，二是贮存，也可以混合不同成分的铁水，专供炼钢炉之用。”
    正当我们凝目仰视这座庞然大物时，一台125吨的桥式天车，把从炼铁厂拉来的冒着火星的铁水罐吊了起来，吊到口朝苍穹的混铁炉口。然后倾斜过来，将热气腾腾的一条金红色瀑布似的金龙，倒入混铁炉中。这样，它们随时可以供给平炉炼钢所需的铁水。这是多么雄浑的生产劳动呵！
    不觉我们一行人已来到了一号平炉前。姚传洪接着介绍：“平炉炼钢是24小时不间断的，所以钢水难免要侵蚀炉体的。照例炼钢的第一道工序是补炉。然后是第二道，加白云石、铁矿石、废钢和一些辅助熔剂等，再兑入铁水，便可进行冶炼。”
    这好复杂，听得我似懂非懂，但多少已懂了一点儿。
    我看到一幅幅光耀的图景，比美术家的创造还更要真实，它完全是真实的。这是你怎么想也想象不到的，那怕你是最富于想象力的文学家。所有这些是最雄伟的图画。当我举头仰望到：铁水罐里的铁水装进混铁炉，又从混铁炉流出，再注入平炉；然后，吹氧平炉将它炼成钢水，多么壮观；然后钢水铸成钢锭；这些钢锭还要送到初轧厂去；轧过后，再送到其它轧钢厂。
    这样的雄壮呵！一首首英雄交响乐！一幅幅现代工业画面的巨大画廊！
    此刻，一号平炉正在呼啸，正在咆哮。冶炼已经开始，钢水尚未沸腾。那平炉宽敞得像一座并不很大的五开间平房，其貌虽不扬，神采却飞扬。它的顶上有三个吹氧气的管道，炉壁上有五个炉门。每个炉门上有一个圆孔。现在炉门和圆孔上都喷出了火焰，是紫罗兰色的火焰。那颜色变幻莫测。但凡火焰之舞，全都是非常非常之好看的。火焰排列整齐，如一队芭蕾舞演员，舞影缭绕。巨大的风暴似的音响，则在伴奏着她们的轻快的动作。
    因为熔炼要有一个相当长的时间，（从前要十六七个小时，现已缩短到了六小时多一点）这段时间里，工人们都在观察着和等待着。徐秉新趁此机会，给我说了一段话：
    “一炼钢是苏联设计的，1959年建成投产。到今年也有30个年头了。第一期工程是六座平炉，其中两座250吨，四座500吨。70年代初，我们又建了两座500吨的炉子。八座之多！可是好多年我们赌咒、发誓，要想年产200万吨钢。总是事与愿违。为什么呢？一是设备落后，50年代的设备怎能炼出80年代的水平来？二是不大愿意对平炉进行技术改造，认为平炉是即将淘汰的事物，花钱改造它不划算。于是有人批评我们抱着平炉不放。可是，说句心里话，谁不愿意看到自己的工厂现代化？但资金有限。平炉却也不是无用之物，因为老厂还大有潜力可挖。1983年我们对一号炉进行了改建，改成为500吨的吹氧平炉。在开始改建时，人们还说我们‘砍头’，砍了一炼钢的头。认为我们不可能成功，说不定将会毁掉一炼钢。即使成功了，产量也是上不去的。但是它成功了，产量竟上去了一倍。投资2500万元，两年半全部收回。这一号炉可立了头功了。它已经炼钢七年之久，应当承认它对武钢作出了它应当作出的开创性的贡献。”
    我听了真是感到了心上发热，为之欢欣鼓舞：好一个一号炉！
    我敢说，任何人只要置身在平炉炉前，绝对地是会产生出豪迈心情来的。我此时又有了这种感觉。自己的任何喜怒哀乐，一概消隐无遗，只见那平炉中，炉火燃烧炽盛，我心中也有了一股逼人的炎热。一道道的强烈光焰，一阵阵的风暴似的吼声，它们充实了我的灵魂。却有二三炼钢工人，正安详地站在炉前，透过蓝色眼镜，在观察炉内的状况。这些被火光照耀的人影，又是多么动人的形象，穿着淡淡的白色的粗布工作服的炉前工，显得比大理石雕象还要美！
    姚传洪看徐厂长在和炼钢工们交谈，对我耳语：“我们厂长可是科班出身的。他开始只是一个炉前工，然后当二助手，一助手，然后当上炉长，然后当总炉长，而后他当上车间主任，又当上了副厂长，到了1984年他担任厂长，现在又兼党委书记。他是一步一步，扎扎实实地走过来的。他进厂前，读完鞍山钢铁工业学校，继之又读业余大学，现在不仅是合格的领导，也是炼钢方面的行家。”
    这时徐秉新回来了，我们移步向前，到了三号炉那儿。李声明似诗兴大发，给我提示：“从一号炉，来到三号炉，就是从1983年，跨入1984年。”这是诗人的语言，拐了一个很大的弯儿的，跳跃的。这我能懂，他说的是改建的炉子和改建的年代，两者被并列在一起了。
    徐秉新说：“是的，1983年改造一号炉，被说成是‘砍头’；1984年改建三号炉，又有人说我们‘腰斩’主厂房。它给我们带来了更加难以想象的困难：因为在整个改造期间，我们要将一炼钢的主厂房一刀斩断。中间摆上一个施工队伍，而两头还要生产。这就阻隔了南北，若组织生产时，稍有不当，生产和建设都要受影响的。我们要求“两不误”：改建争取提前，生产还要超过。这样没日没夜，干了三个月，三号炉投产了。第一年就产量大增。这年一炼钢总产量一下子达到了230万吨，这是1979年起想做到，力争做到而没做到的，最后终于做到了。而且这以后，每年这厂子能增产约20万吨。1988年我们达到了265万吨。今年上半年，因原料供应略有滑坡，产量下降。我们主动要求，下半年要加一把力，把产量提高到144万吨（全年相当于288万吨）。生产力就是壮大了。我们现在正作着必要的准备，以便它进了90年代，生产逐步达到300万吨钢。现在我们的钢种已能炼出200多种。质量过了关，不再是人家当笑话讲的什么：炼出什么钢来就算什么钢的‘民主炼钢’和‘自由铸锭’了，不再有这种事了。现在是严格按照合同所订的，要的什么钢，我们就炼出什么钢。”
    我听他这样说着，心里是滋滋味味的，想的是：他们干得可真“棒”！
    刚才以为是清渣机的这个庞然大物，现在细看一下才发现并不是的，它正好是补炉机，用于冶炼时修补烧蚀的炉膛之用。徐秉新从一位炉前工那儿借来了一副蓝色的眼镜，叫我戴上，让我到炉前靠近补炉机的地方，看一看这补炉的状况，我看到了。不但看清楚了喷嘴中飞迸而出的镁砂，而且主要是我看到了燃烧着的，开始在沸腾起来的钢水。它是这样眩耀的，要是我没戴着蓝色镜子，就看不清这时已接近1600摄氏度的高温之下，这么一幅白热化的美妙景色。
    我们移步向前，经过了一块开阔地。我略有不解之色，徐秉新就发言了：
    “这里原有一座四号炉，那边还有过二号炉。技术改造后觉得不用这多炉子，就把它们拆除了。现在一炼钢共有一、三、五、六、八、七（不是顺序有颠倒，按建成时间顺序排列就是如此的次序）六只炉子。”
    然后，徐秉新开始给我说了1985年改建五号炉的经过：
    “按计划五号炉是最后要改造的一座炉子了。六号炉不想改的。但改建有了困难：一是六号炉有一条料车线要从五号炉前通过。这个问题不解决，则五号炉改造期间，六号炉被迫停产，也就要影响全年生产计划的完成；二是改造期太长，从生产角度着想，改造期最好短一些。这样，完成全年生产任务的把握就大些。然而这两个问题，有关单位都说不好解决。若要改造五号炉，则六号炉就势必停产，工期也难于提前完成。
    “人的记忆总能帮人大忙的。忽然我记起了六号炉的料车线可以改道。当年我还见过这条料车线的图纸。当我向有关部门提出时，他们嫌麻烦不愿接受。这时我们真着急呵，但有什么办法。只好哀求人家：我说，你们有困难，我们来干，你们认可行不行？因为我们不是设计部门，不应该搞大型设计的。有关单位总算帮了我们的大忙。他们说，‘你们可以干’，他们认账好了。那真是太好了。
    “我这个人在干工作上都有点‘得寸进尺’。既为一条料车线要大动干戈，为何不可以借这改建之机，来一个更彻底改造呢？索兴把重油平炉也改成双枪吹氧炉，并借它用八号炉一个多余的电除尘器。花钱不多，既可以提高生产，又可以净化环境。这样的好事，何乐而不为呢？我们决心先改六号炉，再改五号炉。在取得公司经理黄墨滨和张寿荣总工程师的同意后，我们就干开了。
    “说句老实话，平时生产就够紧张了，这一下加了个自行改造六号炉任务，更压得大家喘不过气来。我找车间、科室抽调骨干来干这项工作，他们都说不能抽。我知道他们的难处和心理。但又有什么办法？我只好‘将’他们的‘军’了。我说，好吧，你不让抽他们我先抽你了，你的工作由我来代替。我们同志多好！只要你说清楚了，哪怕有再大的困难，他们也乐意承担的。结果一下子抽来了40多名骨干。有同济大学毕业的设备科副科长胡国鳌；有年纪较大的，八级钳工出身的，设备厂副厂长周秉文，他是省里的技术能手，实际上成了临时的总设计师；还有热能工程师马善宁；和身体不好，带病而来的郑隆蹇，干劲很大；还有匡刚，他的样子，很文雅，不怎么讲话，可是一讲话就讲得很准的。此外，还有负责炉子的结构设计，技术精湛的老工人游炎林。负责氧枪、管网设计的赵明臣……就是这些人苦战了一个多月，六号炉改造成功了，超过了我们预期的效果。紧接着改造五号炉开工。这回上去的就是正式的设计师和正规的施工队伍了。”
    这一番话，说得很动人。在我面前的两个炉子，一下子都活起来。
    姚部长发表评论说：“我们厂长心里，有个长期打算的。他老早就有着280万吨和300万吨的目标的了。”
    李声明看我很兴奋，又出了个点子，他建议我们可前去看八号炉了，“走，到八号炉，我们厂长的最精采的故事是在八号炉。”
    “真的？”我发问。
    姚部长回答：“真的。”
    我们到八号炉就进了操作室。它正对着炉子，里面是一些自动化的装置和多种仪表，炉长正在接电话，化验室在报告取样化验钢水的结果。我问炉前一个班组有多少工人？一个工人回答，“11人。”人不多，而劳动强度那么大，实在很大，叫人佩服不已。但我想到我还得回到我的问题上来。
    “是怎么样的最精采的故事？”我又问了姚部长一句。
    徐秉新说，“哪有什么精采故事？你别信他们的。八号炉有一个复合炉底，他们说的就是这个炉底。当然炉底是最重要的。要是炉底漏钢水了，那可不得了。如发生爆炸，可是特大事故了。现在世界上平炉炼钢正逐步被转炉炼钢所取代，但平炉炼钢还没有全部被淘汰。我国平炉座数在减少，其钢产量还不少。大型的吹氧平炉数目不算多，但是用氧强度不断提高，炉底侵蚀的问题就很严重了。这些年我们经常研究炉底问题，作过多次试验。关于技术不必详细说了。采用所谓‘复合炉底’的构想是从1983年年底开始的。到1985年的年底，在八号炉上采用了特定的炉底砌筑和‘助烧结与自烧结’相结合的办法，成功了，效果很不错。经过两年半，冶炼了1702炉钢，做了一次检查发现，打结材料已成为整体层，上部立砌镁砖与烧结层熔为一体，下部砌砖完好如初。如果你有兴趣，我有几篇论文，可以送你，不过不是什么精采故事，而是极其枯燥的技术资料。”说到这里，他笑了起来。
    我说，“这还是很精采的。我希望能读到你的论文。”
    “我到加拿大去考察时，曾问过他们的炉底有什么成果，其实我们是已经解决了的，不过也问问。他们说有很出色的成果，有图纸。如果要，定价三万美元。三万！我没有要，只是从中知道了，我们那个成果仅图纸都还值三万美元呢。”他笑了。
    这时，炉前工又在取样。值班室里的炉长，随炉前工的一挥手，打开一扇炉门。顿时好像一个太阳从地平线上升起，照得我睁不开眼睛。这个炼钢工挺着长矛似的长勺儿，站到灼人的炉门口，捞起一勺钢水来，将长勺放到地面上。许多火花飞溅，如金色的花朵飞舞。我跑到离那儿不远处，看到他勺儿里倒出了个小圆饼来，他将这火红的圆饼拿到一个管道口子上，放进去。他们说这是高压风洞，能立刻将它吹送到化验室。一忽儿，它的化学成份就通知到操作室里。经过若干次的取样化验，待到钢水成份合格时，就可以出钢了。
    在炉前，我差不多已经对每个炉子都有所了解了，我仿佛进入了一个迷人的旅游胜地。这好像参观了法国巴黎郊外的凡尔赛宫。和参观华盛顿白宫也差不大离。不过这完全是另外的一回事了。这是力的场所。你炉前的感受，是沸腾的钢水和你自己的沸腾的血液结合在一起了。你想的是你也要贡献你自己，绝不会想到你要去享受人间最好的享受。你只感到精神振奋，你只感到自己有愧，但又并不是懊丧，而是满怀着信心，充溢着饱满的，乐观的情绪。在这种情绪下，你会感到我们的前景是无比辉煌的。
    八号炉出钢的时刻来到。我被带到了铸锭车间的一条正对着炉子的长长的走道上，那里有专门为观察出钢而设计的一个小平台，全景展现在眼前。正是长682米的铸锭车间，如同一幅长卷拉开在我们眼前。我们在等待着，看得到工人们正在装炮。他们说到有一家军工厂，专为钢厂制造了炸开平炉的出钢口的炮弹的。我们稍稍地等待了一会儿。
    到时候了，果然一声炮响，立刻闪出一道白光，从两个槽口泻下来两股钢水。光采夺目，不尽地飞溅钢花，如天雨花，也似天女撒满了鲜花。也许最好看的是这钢花飞迸，有如节日的礼花，它确比烟火还好看。
    可是李声明说道，“那飞迸的金色的钢花看起来虽然好看，实际上它们却是渣，也叫钢渣，实在是毫无价值的渣子。”虽然现在连渣子也可以有它的用处，但是，他冷冷地又加了一句，“发光的并不都是钢。还要注意，别叫人哄了。”
    真是诗人！这话有意思，我禁不住暗自给他喝起采来。
    从那两个槽口，飞下了两道光芒万丈的飞瀑，它们跳下两个巨大的钢水罐。我并没有觉得这不同于李白的诗句“疑是银河落九天。”我觉得这毋宁是：“当太阳爬上了中天，那时万物的主宰拿出他的金天秤。”把国家的命运和钢铁的产量，“放在两头，他把天秤的杆子吊起”，如果钢铁的重量很轻，国家的命运就要“屈服而下沉”；如果钢产量很重很重，国运就要上升，“上达天空”。这是我忽然想起我曾翻译过的这段希腊史诗《依利阿德》中的有名诗句。却也是很美，而且很有深意的。
    我发现我是在一个大工业的中心点上。它不仅是武钢连续作业线上的一个中间工序厂，也是全国工业的连续作业线上的中心，并且也是最关键的一个中心环节。我把这意思告诉了徐秉新，他说，“是的，有人说过，这里是特殊的战场！”
    我肃然，心中立刻叫好，并问他，他是怎么体会这句话的呢。
    他回答我，“在平炉炉台上，也是分秒必争的。也是生死之地、存亡之道。你看，这上、中、下，三个层次作战，有如海陆空三军的互相配合。只能战胜，不能容许任何一点失算。假如一个国家没有钢，就谈不到国防。没有了强大的国防，就什么也谈不上了，人民就失去了安全的屏障。”
    他这些话也使我禁不住激动了。这是一个“特殊的战场！”它关系到钢铁的产量。它决定国家的强弱、民族的命运、人民的幸福。
    今天，吹氧平炉也应当是国家生活的高峰之一，甚至是我们的工业文学、工业美学、工业诗歌的峰顶之一。它应与科技文学、科技美学、科技诗歌，双双地并峙着。
    现在我很想知道，武钢的钢铁，到底作了什么用？起了什么作用？
    姚部长在我回去之前，把徐秉新的三篇炉底论文送来了，还送给了我一本《一炼钢厂志》。从中我看到了这样的一段文章：“武钢的钢铁用于北京地铁，黄河战备大桥，渤海海底探油井架，广州广播电视塔，菲尔泽水电站，坦桑尼亚—赞比亚铁道，大庆号、风雷号、风暴号、长风号远洋轮船。风光号曾航经地中海、太平洋、大西洋、印度洋，穿过了六个海峡，两次绕过好望角，四次通过赤道区，行程32000海里，同十几米高的惊涛骇浪搏斗三昼夜，而安然返航。”
    当然还有许多其他用途，这本志书里没有说。就此也可以知道，这里的确是一个非同小可的特殊的战场。想想看，一个钢厂，六只炉子，年产200多万吨到300万吨钢，这是一个什么样的战场？我可是还没有说到二炼钢，以及正在筹建的三炼钢呢，呵，还有那驰名遐迩的‘一米七’等轧钢系统……轧钢厂……这个特殊的战场呵！
