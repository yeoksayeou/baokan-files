Upon entering the Huainan Normal Affiliated Primary School in Anhui, one is immediately struck by the vibrant atmosphere.

This primary school has diligently implemented a three-pronged approach involving the school, parents, and society, utilizing six channels both within and outside the school to educate the children. This has led to a networked and institutionalized moral education system, earning the school the title of "Civilized School" and "Advanced Collective for Teaching and Educating People" by Huainan City and Anhui Province for five consecutive years.

Since 1983, the school has taken the lead, with support from parents and society, to launch a "Three Good" competition across the school: "Be a good student at school, a good child at home, and a good youth in society." They designed a competition handbook, allowing each student, along with their teachers and parents, to record the child's behavior at school, at home, and in society, ensuring honest and consistent documentation.

The school has also established six channels for moral education, with the principal, logistics personnel, and students working together to beautify the campus and cultivate the moral character of teachers and students. Students maintain a daily ten-minute morning clean-up, ensuring the ground is free of litter, walls are free of scratches, and desks and chairs are free of ink marks. The principal, academic affairs office, class teachers, and students work together to deliver effective moral education and class meetings, focusing on the "Three Good" competition to cultivate "Four Haves" new people through collective effort. The principal, Young Pioneers brigade (including middle and small teams), and members work diligently to organize brigade activities, promoting self-reliance, mutual help, and personal progress. The brigade's publications, such as the "Star and Torch Newspaper," "Little Smart Column," and "Red Scarf Radio Station," timely propagate and introduce new practices and deeds from various teams. The principal, academic affairs office, various subject teachers, and students work together to foster mutual respect and love between teachers and students. The principal, parents, and students collaborate to run the school-wide parents' school, first-grade students' parents' school, and only-child parents' school, sharing the responsibility of educating children. The school, social education committee, parents, and students work together to guide school moral education and family education. The social education committee is composed of key units, residential committees, police stations, and school leaders from the school district, with the main task of coordinating the school's relationship with various sectors of society to jointly plan for education.

Due to the attention and advice from all parties, they have also adopted methods such as tangible visual aids, telling revolutionary stories, distinguishing right from wrong, on-site emotional exercises, leading by example, and self-education in moral education, ensuring that students' thoughts always follow the correct "Four Haves" direction. Good deeds are abundant, and a spirit of diligence, progress, unity, and civilization has been formed throughout the school. Many factories far from the school have repeatedly requested to enroll their children.

    多管齐下教育娃娃
    ——记淮南师范附属小学德育工作网络化制度化
    本报记者　张振国
    一走进安徽淮南师范附属小学，处处都给人一种生机勃勃的感觉。
    这个小学，认真采取学校、家长、社会三位一体，校内校外，六条渠道的办法多管齐下，教育娃娃，使全校德育工作网络化、制度化，连续五年被淮南市和安徽省评为“文明学校”和“教书育人先进集体”。
    一九八三年来，他们以学校为主，得到家长、社会支持，在全校开展了“在校做个好学生，在家做个好孩子，在社会做个好少年”的
  “三好”竞赛。并设计了一本竞赛手册，让每个学生及其老师、家长填写娃娃在校、在家、在社会的表现，做到如实填写，持之以恒。
    他们还以学校为主，形成六条德育教育渠道：一是校长、后勤人员、学生齐心协力美化校园，陶冶师生情操。学生每天坚持十分钟晨扫，始终做到地上无纸屑、墙上无划痕、桌凳无墨迹。二是校长、教导处、班主任、学生共同努力，上好思想品德课、班会课，抓好“三好”竞赛，用集体的力量造就“四有”新人。三是校长、少先队大队部（包括中、小队）、队员尽心尽力抓好队的活动，提倡“自己的活动自己搞，自己的事情自己做，自己的同学自己帮，自己的进步自己争”。大队部主办的《星星火炬报》、《小灵通》专栏、“红领巾”广播站，及时宣传、评介各中队新风尚、新事迹。四是校长、教导处、各科教师、学生同心同德以美的情操、爱的温暖，促进师生互敬互爱。五是校长、家长、学生相互配合，认真办好全校性的家长学校、一年级学生家长和独生子女家长学校，共挑育人重担。六是学校、社会教育委员会、家长、学生内外结合，做好学校德育和家庭教育的指导工作。社教会由本学区一些较大单位、居委会、派出所及学校主要领导人组成，其任务主要是协调学校同社会各界的联系，共商育入大计。
    由于各方关注，多方献计，他们在德育方面还采用了实物直观、讲革命故事、明辨是非、现场表演情操练习、榜样导行、自我教育等方法，使学生思想始终沿着“四有”的正确方向潜移默化。好人好事层出不穷，勤奋、进取、团结、文明新风已在全校形成。有不少远离该校的厂矿一再要求把孩子送来就读。
