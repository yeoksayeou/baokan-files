In the northeast of Dukuo Township, Xuanhan County, Sichuan Province, about 500 meters away, there is a place with rugged and towering rocks, known locally as Stone Pass.

Here, the mountain top is flat and curved without peaks, and the middle is concave like a pass. On both sides, there are steep ridges, resembling several brown helmets placed side by side and turned upside down on the mountain. The entire mountain is densely covered with grayish-white, bumpy shield-like limestone rocks of various sizes. In the crevices between the rocks, there are clusters of low shrubs, resembling camouflage on the helmets.

On the mountain slopes, there are numerous exposed giant rocks, piled up in heaps and rows. The large and small rocks exhibit a myriad of postures. Some resemble dragons leaping and tigers pouncing; others look like horses galloping and fish and turtles vying for space. Some are like rhinoceroses gazing at the moon and hippopotamuses basking in the sun; others resemble tortoises racing hares and carp leaping out of water.

Standing at the pass, one can see two mountains facing each other; looking down, one's eyes are filled with an endless sea of stones. Beneath one's feet, every rock is crisscrossed with undulating, twisting patterns, like countless waves of the sea. Touching them, they are smooth and slippery; weighing them, they are heavy; tapping them, they produce a clear, resonant sound. Here, the smooth and slippery dragon-bone stones form the ridges and lines of the mountain, orderly and without any irregularities. Gazing at the western peak, the rocks of various shapes and sizes are even more magnificent. In one corner, the scattered rocks resemble a group of monkeys playing; in another, the stone figures of people and horses seem to gather like a fleet of warships. Some resemble lions sitting majestically, full of vigor; others seem like a hundred beasts paying homage to their king, bowing down in reverence.

Beyond the western mountain, sitting and gazing at the eastern ridge, the undulating giant rocks each have their own unique expressions, surging forward and backward, vivid and lifelike. There are countless wonders to see and countless strange sights to describe. Where did the stone sea and stone beasts come from? In the geological ages, this was once an ocean. The limestone rocks were shaped by the waves over a long period, gradually forming dragon-bone stones with wave patterns. Later, the mountain-building movement caused the seabed to rise, and the water receded. The strangely shaped rocks were then sculpted by wind and rain, becoming the awe-inspiring Stone Pass we see today.

　　石垭子
　　冼夫
    四川宣汉县渡口乡东北侧500米处，有一怪石嶙峋的所在，当地人称石垭子。
    这里山顶平曲无峰峦，中间低凹成垭口，两旁突兀多山岭，酷似几个褐色的大头盔并列倒扣山上。遍山密密麻麻如灰白斑凸的挡箭牌，其实是大小不等的石灰岩石块。在石头堆的夹缝里，长着一簇簇低矮的树丛，俨然头盔上的伪装。
    山坡上面，挤满了袒胸露腹的巨石，一堆堆，一排排……大小石头，仪态万千。如龙腾虎跃、骏马奔腾；似游龙戏水、鱼鳖争流；犹犀牛望月、河马探日；像龟兔赛跑、鲤鱼跳水……
    伫立垭口，可见两山对峙；俯首鸟瞰，眼收无边石海。脚底下，每块石头上纵横交织的花纹起伏扭曲，如千波万滔的海浪。摸一摸，滑溜溜；掂一掂，沉甸甸；敲一敲，音铿锵。在这里，油滑光溜的龙骨石组成了石岭，牵成了石线，规则有序，毫不错杂。遥望西峰，那千姿百态的石头更是壮观。那一隅，乱石如遍地戏耍的猴群；这一厢，石像人马如云集的艨艟。或者似雄狮盘坐，英姿勃勃；或者犹百兽朝王，俯伏九叩……越过西山，坐凝东岭，起伏的巨石，各具情态，前攒后涌，维妙维肖。看不完的奇境，道不尽的异观。石海石兽从何而来？远在地质年代，此乃海洋所在，石灰岩经水浪拍打，天长日久，渐成显有水浪痕迹的龙骨石。以后，造山运动使海底上升，海水退去，奇形怪状的石头又经风雕雨琢，成了今天这令人嗟叹的石垭子。
