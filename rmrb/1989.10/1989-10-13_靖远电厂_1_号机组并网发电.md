The first unit of the Jingyuan Power Plant, a key project of the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan," has recently been successfully connected to the grid and started generating electricity. The commissioning of a 200,000-kilowatt thermal power unit marks the beginning of the correction of the imbalance between hydro and thermal power and the severe power shortage in Gansu Province.

The first phase of the Jingyuan Power Plant is equipped with four units totaling 800,000 kilowatts, with a total investment of 845 million yuan. It is a joint venture between the Ministry of Energy and Gansu Province and is scheduled to be completed in 1992.
