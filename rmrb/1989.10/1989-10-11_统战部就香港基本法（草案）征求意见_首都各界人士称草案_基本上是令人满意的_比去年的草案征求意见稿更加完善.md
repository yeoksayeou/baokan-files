The United Front Work Department held a symposium today to solicit opinions on the draft of the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China." Representatives from various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, non-partisan individuals, as well as the Taiwan Affairs Association, Huangpu Alumni Association, Association of Returned Overseas Chinese, Taiwan Alumni Association, and the Chinese Vocational Education Society, along with relevant experts and scholars, totaling more than 60 people, attended the symposium.

Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, and Lei Jiong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, attended the symposium.

Li Hou, Secretary-General of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law Drafting Committee, and Lu Ping, Deputy Secretary-General, introduced to the attendees some opinions recently proposed by Hong Kong and other regions in China regarding the draft of the Basic Law.

At the symposium, attendees actively participated in the discussion. A responsible person from the Central Committee of the China Democratic League said that this draft law is basically satisfactory. From the preamble to the specific articles in each chapter, it reflects the great concept of "one country, two systems" and the spirit of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong, which both maintains national sovereignty and is beneficial to the continued prosperity and stability of Hong Kong after 1997.

A National Political Consultative Conference member and a university professor in their speeches thought that the current draft is more refined than the draft for soliciting opinions last year. The draft of the Basic Law has made many considerations based on the actual situation in Hong Kong regarding the regulations on the relationship between the central government and the special administrative region.

Some members of democratic parties pointed out that the future political system of Hong Kong must gradually develop towards democracy. This democracy is based on the "one country, two systems" principle, which must ensure that Hong Kong's capitalist system remains unchanged for fifty years, and must not allow the emergence of a power in Hong Kong that opposes the central government. Otherwise, it will destroy the "one country, two systems" principle and will harm the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.

Some legal experts suggested that the Basic Law should not be too detailed, and some articles should not be too rigid, leaving some flexibility.

    统战部就香港基本法（草案）征求意见
    首都各界人士称草案“基本上是令人满意的”“比去年的草案征求意见稿更加完善”
    本报北京10月10日讯　新华社记者黄日尧、本报记者王谨报道：中共中央统战部今天召开各界人士座谈会，征求对
  《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法（草案）》的意见。各民主党派、全国工商联、无党派人士，以及台联、黄埔同学会、欧美同学会、台湾同学会、中华职教社等团体和有关专家学者共60多人参加了座谈会。
    全国人大常委会副委员长、香港基本法起草委员会副主任委员王汉斌和全国人大常委会副委员长、香港基本法起草委员雷洁琼出席了座谈会。
    香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会秘书长李后、副秘书长鲁平分别就最近香港和全国其他地区对基本法（草案）提出的一些意见，向参加座谈会的各界人士作了介绍。
    在座谈会上，各界人士发言踊跃。民盟中央的一位负责人说，这部法律草案基本上是令人满意的，从序言到各章节的具体条文，都体现出“一个国家、两种制度”的伟大构想和港人治港的精神，既维护了国家主权，又有利于保持1997年以后香港的继续繁荣和稳定。
    一位全国政协委员和一位大学教授在发言中认为，现在的草案比去年的草案征求意见稿更加完善了。有关中央与特别行政区关系的规定，基本法（草案）已根据香港的实际情况，作了很多的照顾。
    一些民主党派人士指出，香港未来的政治体制必须循序渐进地朝民主方向发展。这个民主是建立在“一国两制”基础上的民主，既要能保证香港的资本主义制度五十年不变，又不能允许在香港出现一个与中央对抗的政权。否则，必将破坏“一国两制”，必将损害香港的繁荣稳定。
      有的法律专家建议，基本法不宜订得太细，一些条文不宜写得太死，要有一定的弹性。
