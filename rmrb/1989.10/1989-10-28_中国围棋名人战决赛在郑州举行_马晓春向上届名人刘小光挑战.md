The second "Qiong Lian Cup" Chinese Go Championship final will commence tomorrow in Zhengzhou. The organizing committee held a brief but solemn opening ceremony today.

At tonight's opening ceremony, nine-dan player Ma Xiaochun, who fought hard to win the right to challenge, humorously said, "In the final battle, the home-field advantage is all on the opponent's side, but I still have confidence in my ability to perform at my best." The defending champion Liu Xiaoguang, also a nine-dan player, expressed, "Participating in such a major competition in my hometown is a great opportunity for me to repay the kindness of my fellow citizens with my skills. I must cherish this opportunity."

The final, which will determine the title of this year's champion, will be a best-of-five series. The first three games will be held in Zhengzhou, co-hosted by the Xiangjiang Grand Hotel, the Zhongzhou Hotel, and the Henan Broadcasting and Television News Center.

Henan Deputy Governor Yu Youxian and Provincial Political Consultative Conference Vice Chairman Zhao Zhengfu attended the opening ceremony and wished the two players success in the competition.
