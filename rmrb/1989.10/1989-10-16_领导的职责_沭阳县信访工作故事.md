In April of this year, at the information and visits work conference held in Huaiyin City, Jiangsu Province, Suiyang County shared their experiences. In July, at the Jiangsu Province conference on solving old information and visits cases, Suiyang County again gave a model speech.

Since 1986, the number of information and visits cases in Suiyang County has been decreasing year by year, and the case closure rate has been continuously increasing. Last year, the number of information and visits cases decreased by 21.2% compared to previous years, and the case closure rate reached 96.5%. Among them, the closure rate for key and old cases was 100%.

Whenever people talk about the recent changes in Suiyang County's information and visits work, the county's residents always say with deep emotion: "This is all thanks to the county's Party committee and government leaders who work diligently for the people and spare no effort to solve the people's problems."

The leaders of Suiyang County always say: "These are our duties."

On one evening in April, after County Party Secretary Zhao Xuefen returned from a trip to the countryside, he immediately sat down to review letters from the people. He worked until dawn.

The office staff saw that his eyes were red from fatigue and that he had lost weight, and they all advised him to go back and rest early. But Zhao Xuefen just smiled and said, "We can't let the people worry and be disappointed!" With that, he called a meeting with the heads of relevant county departments to seriously study and discuss a letter he had just received from some workers at the flax mill, who complained that the mill's cadres had engaged in deception during recruitment.

A few days later, Zhao Xuefen went to listen to the report on the investigation conducted by relevant county departments regarding the issues raised by the flax mill workers in their letter.

When he learned that the conflict was due to the mill's cadres not making the recruitment matters public, causing the workers to be anxious and suspicious, leading to dissatisfaction and complaints, he immediately ordered the relevant county departments and the mill to publicly announce all recruitment matters, thus avoiding an unnecessary wave of petitions.

To promptly solve the people's problems, the leaders of the Suiyang County Party Committee made a rule: any problems raised by the people during petitions must be investigated promptly and resolved within a set time. They also stipulated that county leaders should treat the people's difficulties as their own and solve them seriously.

Suiyang has an old petitioner—Li Zhaolun, a young farmer from Luyu Village, Nanguan Township. Every time Li Zhaolun comes to petition, County Party Vice Secretary Wu Hongbiao always receives him warmly, offering him a seat and tea, and patiently listening to his complaints. Wu Hongbiao discovered that this young man, who had been petitioning for five years, indeed had his reasons, so he ordered the relevant departments to reinvestigate.

It turned out that Li Zhaolun had been treated unfairly in a dispute, his house was dilapidated and uninhabitable, and he was facing economic difficulties, leading him to petition multiple times. Due to some departments "passing the buck" and the complexity of his problems, which were difficult to solve, Li Zhaolun became a long-term petitioner.

Based on the above situation, Wu Hongbiao personally met with the heads of the county information and visits bureau, the civil affairs bureau, and the leaders of the township and village where Li Zhaolun resides, demanding that they solve Li Zhaolun's housing problem within a short period. Now, the construction of Li Zhaolun's two new rooms has begun. Seeing the soon-to-be-completed new house, this tough man couldn't help but shed tears of emotion.

He told everyone: "It's still good to be in a socialist society!"

    领导的职责
    ——沭阳县信访工作故事
    沈根
    今年4月，在江苏省淮阴市召开的信访工作会议上，沭阳县介绍了他们的经验；在今年7月召开的江苏省解决信访老户经验交流会上，沭阳县又作了典型发言——
    从1986年以来，沭阳县信访量逐年下降，结案率不断提高，去年信访量比往年下降21.2％，结案率达96.5％，其中重点、老户案件结案率均达100％。
    每当人们谈及沭阳县近几年来信访工作的可喜变化，这个县的群众总是深情地说：“这都是县委、县府领导勤政为民，竭尽全力为群众排忧解难的结果。”
    沭阳县的领导又总是说：“这些都是我们应尽的职责。”
    今年4月的一天傍晚，县委书记赵学凤下乡刚回到办公室，就伏案批阅群众信件。一直到天亮。
    办公室的同志见他眼熬红了，人消瘦了，都劝他早点回去休息，可赵学凤笑笑说：“不能让群众着急和失望啊！”说罢，他便召集县有关部门负责同志开“碰头会”，就自己刚收到的麻纺厂部分职工反映厂干部在招工中有弄虚作假现象的来信作了认真的研究讨论。
    时隔几日，赵学凤又专门下去听取了县有关部门对麻纺厂职工来信反映问题的调查汇报。
    当他得知矛盾是由于该厂招工事项干部未向职工公开，故使职工忧心忡忡而产生猜测、不满情绪引起时，当即责成县有关部门和该厂将招工所有事项张榜公布，从而避免了一场不必要的上访风波。
    为了及时给群众排忧解难，沭阳县委领导成员做出了一条规定：凡是群众上访中提出的问题，必须迅速调查，限期结案。他们还规定，县领导要把群众的困难当成自己的事去认真解决。
    沭阳有个老上访户——南关乡吕圩村的青年农民李兆伦。李兆伦每次来访，县委副书记吴洪彪总是热情接待，让坐、倒茶，耐心听其诉说。吴洪彪发现这个上访达5年之久的青年确有苦衷，于是他责成有关部门重新调查。
    原来，李兆伦因与别人发生纠纷受处理偏重、房子破旧无法栖身和经济困难等问题，多次上访。由于个别部门“踢皮球”，加之他的问题复杂，难于解决，李兆伦便成了上访老户。
    根据上述情况，吴洪彪亲自找县信访局、民政局的负责同志和李兆伦所在乡、村的领导，要求他们一定要在近期内解决李兆伦的住房问题。如今，李兆伦的两间新房已开始兴建。目睹即将竣工的新房，李兆伦这个硬汉子禁不住流下了激动的热泪。
    他逢人便说：“还是社会主义好！”
