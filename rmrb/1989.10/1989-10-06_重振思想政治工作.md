In the midst of profound social changes, ideological and political work faces unprecedented challenges. The re-evaluation of ideological and political work has come at a heavy cost.

Under the influence of the "leftist" guiding ideology, ideological and political work has produced some negative effects. It artificially exaggerated the functions of ideological and political work, wrongly treating it as something that is "above everything, replaces everything, and impacts everything," causing people to suffer greatly.

In recent years, while eliminating these negative aspects, there has been a widespread tendency to neglect and weaken ideological and political work. More seriously, some people have even raised the banner of "reforming ideological and political work" with the intention of abolishing it altogether. The consequences of this are mainly reflected in several areas:

First, there are mistakes in the guiding ideology.

During the reform and opening up, it is correct to fully utilize economic means, but economic work cannot do without ideological and political work; the two are dialectically unified and mutually promoting.

However, the former General Secretary did not focus on party building and downplayed ideological and political work. While emphasizing the concentration of efforts on modernization, he neglected Marxist education and the education of the "four haves"; while emphasizing the centrality of economic construction, he neglected the education of the two fundamental points, leading to the phenomenon of the party not managing the party; while emphasizing reform and opening up, he neglected the education to resist capitalist decadent thoughts; while emphasizing the liberation of thought, he neglected the education to adhere to the four cardinal principles; while emphasizing the improvement of ideological and political work, he neglected the inheritance and promotion of effective traditional methods and practices of ideological and political work. He only emphasized guiding through interest, rejecting positive education and indoctrination, which is essentially a sign of weakness in ideological and political work. Furthermore, he used economic benefits as the sole criterion for evaluating and assessing all work, and material incentives as the sole means.

Second, there is a "gap" in the transition from the old to the new system.

On one hand, in the political and economic system reform of our country, we are in the transitional stage from the old to the new system, and we should have incorporated ideological and political work into the new track. However, at this critical juncture, ideological and political work was artificially downplayed, leading to serious bureaucratism and corruption. This resulted in the neglect of "serving the people," the lack of promotion of "public servants," the outdated concept of "hard work," and the abandonment of the party's purpose. On the other hand, in the transition from the old to the new system of ideological and political work, there is a "gap." When the new pattern has not yet been clearly established, the traditional good methods were abandoned, and only innovation and reform were emphasized, without inheriting and promoting them, leaving people at a loss and ultimately abandoning ideological and political work.

Third, the mechanism of ideological and political work is out of control.

Over the years, we have basically established a relatively complete political work mechanism, but there are also aspects that do not adapt to the new situation. As a result, the tendency to cut political work institutions first and reduce political work personnel first has emerged. The remaining limited political work personnel have no share in professional title evaluations, are not prioritized in salary increases, and receive much less bonuses compared to other management personnel. Only the roles of factory directors, managers, and school principals in "reversing the situation" are emphasized, while the role of the party's leadership and ideological and political work in the reform is not seen. It seems that party secretaries and political workers are all conservatives, and even they are regarded as obstacles to reform.

Fourth, the effectiveness of ideological and political work is lost.

Under the influence of downplaying ideological and political work, some people equate preaching big principles with talking big, and equate patient persuasion with talking nonsense, making some leading cadres not value ideological and political work, political workers not dare to grasp ideological and political work, and the masses not believe in ideological and political work. In government agencies, officials often compete for positions, compare benefits, and demand welfare, rather than comparing consciousness and contributions. In rural areas, only methods such as "working through fines, collecting grain through punishment, and family planning through chasing" can be implemented. Many people have changed from "eating clear soup when holding a bowl, and singing to their mothers when putting down the bowl" to "eating meat when holding a bowl, and cursing when putting down the chopsticks."

It is clear that neglecting ideological and political work and lacking a spiritual pillar has dire consequences. Reflecting on the past, we must seriously learn from historical lessons, overcome the trend of ideological and political work shrinking, and revitalize the spirit of ideological and political work.

    重振思想政治工作
    中共辽宁省辽中县委书记　蔺欣荣
    在深刻的社会变革中，思想政治工作面临着空前严峻的考验。而对思想政治工作的再认识，是人们付出沉重的代价后换来的。
    在“左”的指导思想影响下，思想政治工作曾产生过一些弊端，人为地过分夸大思想政治工作的功能，错误地把它当成“高于一切、代替一切、冲击一切”的东西，使人们尝尽了苦头。
    近些年在消除这些弊病中，又普遍出现了忽视和削弱思想政治工作的倾向。更为严重的是有人竟打出“改造思想政治工作”的旗号，妄图取消思想政治工作。其后果主要表现在几个环节上：
    一是指导思想上的失误。
    在改革开放中，充分发挥经济手段的作用是正确的，但经济工作离不开思想政治工作，二者是辩证统一、互相促进的。
    然而，前总书记不抓党的建设，淡化思想政治工作。在强调集中精力进行现代化建设的同时，忽视了马克思主义教育和“四有”教育；在强调以经济建设为中心的同时，忽视了两个基本点的教育，出现了党不管党的现象；在强调改革开放的同时，忽视了抵制资本主义腐朽思想的教育；在强调解放思想的同时，忽视了坚持四项基本原则的教育；在强调改进思想政治工作的同时，忽视了继承和发扬被实践证明了行之有效的思想政治工作好传统、好方法。只强调靠兴趣引导，排斥正面教育和灌输等手段，实质上是思想政治工作软弱的表现。进而把经济效益作为检验和考核各项工作的唯一标准，把物质鼓励当成唯一的手段。
    二是新旧体制转换中的“空档”。一方面在我国政治经济体制改革中，正处于新旧体制转换阶段，本应把思想政治工作纳入更新轨道。但在这关键环节上人为地淡化思想政治工作，导致产生了严重的官僚主义和腐败现象。造成“为人民服务”不讲了，“人民公仆”不提倡了，“艰苦奋斗”过时了，“党的宗旨”抛离了。另一方面在思想政治工作新旧体制转换中出现了“空档”。当新的格局尚未明确和建立起来时，又放弃了传统的好方法，只强调改造创新，不讲继承发扬，使人们无所适从，干脆放弃了思想政治工作。
    三是思想政治工作机制失控。多年来，我们基本建立起了比较完整的政工机制，也存在不适应新形势的一面。于是出现砍机构先砍政工机构，减人员先减政工人员的局面。所剩有限的政工人员在职称评定上没份，长工资排不上号，奖金比其他管理人员少得多。只强调厂长、经理、校长如何“扭转乾坤”，而党的领导和思想政治工作在改革中起的作用却看不到。似乎党委书记和政工干部都是保守派，甚至把他们当作改革的绊脚石。
    四是思想政治工作效应失灵。在淡化思想政治工作的影响下，有些人把讲大道理与说大话等同起来，把耐心说服与耍嘴皮子相提并论，使一些领导干部不重视思想政治工作，政工干部不敢抓思想政治工作，广大群众不相信思想政治工作。在机关干部中往往争地位、比待遇、要福利，不比觉悟和贡献。在农村只能实行“出工靠罚款、交粮靠惩罚、计划生育靠追赶”的办法。不少人由过去“端起碗来喝清汤，放下碗后唱亲娘”，变成了“端起碗来吃肉，放下筷子骂娘”。
    可见，忽视思想政治工作，缺少精神支柱的后果是不堪设想的。痛定思痛，我们必须认真记取历史的教训，克服思想政治工作日趋萎缩的现象，重振思想政治工作的雄风。
