The People's Daily has learned that the Supreme People's Court has rejected the appeal of Nixiancai.

Former Governor of Jiangxi Province and Vice Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee, Nixiancai, was sentenced to two years in prison by the Jiangxi High People's Court in May 1987 for the crime of abusing power for personal gain. After serving his sentence, Nixiancai appealed to the Supreme People's Court. The Supreme People's Court conducted a legal review and found that the Jiangxi High People's Court's judgment in the Nixiancai case was clear in facts, sufficient in evidence, accurate in classification, appropriate in sentencing, and legal in procedure. Recently, the Supreme People's Court legally rejected Nixiancai's appeal and sent him a notice of rejection.

    本报讯　记者从最高人民法院获悉：最高人民法院已驳回了倪献策的申诉。
    原江西省省长、省委副书记倪献策是1987年5月由江西省高级人民法院以徇私舞弊罪终审判处两年有期徒刑的。倪献策今年刑满释放后向最高人民法院提出申诉。最高人民法院依法进行了审查，认为江西省高级人民法院对倪献策一案的判决事实清楚，证据充分，定性准确，量刑适当，程序合法，是正确的。前不久，最高人民法院依法驳回了倪献策的申诉，并向他发了驳回申诉的通知。
