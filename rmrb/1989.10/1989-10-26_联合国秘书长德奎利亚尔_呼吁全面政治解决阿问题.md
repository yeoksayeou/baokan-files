United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today, in a report submitted to the General Assembly for consideration, called on the international community to boost the confidence of the Afghan people, to seek a comprehensive political solution to the Afghan problem, and to establish a new government with a broad base.

The report states that, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, although the Soviet Union completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan on February 15 this year, the current situation in Afghanistan is still unstable, and the Afghan people are still in the midst of disaster.

In the report, Pérez de Cuéllar pointed out that due to mutual accusations among the parties concerned about the Afghan issue for violating the Geneva Accords, as well as the continuous fighting between the Afghan guerrillas and the Kabul regime supported by the Soviet Union, the implementation of the Geneva Accords faces enormous difficulties.

Pérez de Cuéllar said in the report that he had hoped that the protracted Afghan civil war could end this year.

　　呼吁全面政治解决阿问题
    新华社联合国10月23日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天在一份提交给联大审议的报告中，呼吁国际社会增强阿富汗人民的信心，全面政治解决阿富汗问题，建立一个具有广泛基础的新政府。
    报告说，遵照日内瓦协议，苏联虽然在今年2月15日完成了从阿富汗的撤军，但是，阿富汗目前的局势并不稳定，阿富汗人民仍然处于灾难之中。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔在报告中指出，由于阿富汗问题有关各方相互指责对方违反日内瓦协议以及阿富汗游击队同苏联支持的喀布尔政权之间的战事接连不断，使得日内瓦协议的执行面临巨大的困难。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔在报告中说，他曾希望旷日持久的阿富汗内战能在今年结束。
