Science tells us that from infancy to the age of seven, a person’s intellectual development is at its fastest. If we pay attention to early childhood education and lay a solid foundation for their psychological and intellectual development during this period, it will be crucial for their future growth.

Recently, the Sichuan Youth and Children’s Publishing House has begun publishing a beautifully illustrated series of books titled *Why? Why? Why? for Children*. The first batch of five volumes has already been published, and I found them very appealing and enjoyable.

The series is edited by a group of experienced science popularizers and child educators. The chief editor is Wang Guozhong, who was also the editor of the popular children’s science book *Why? Why? Why?* published in the early 1960s. To adapt to the global trend of emphasizing early childhood education, they began conceptualizing and designing this series in the fall of 1986. After a year of hard work, they collected nearly 5,000 questions through correspondence, visits, and discussions with nearly 100 kindergartens in 17 provinces and municipalities, including rural, remote, and minority areas. From these, they selected 383 questions for the first batch, which are divided into five volumes: *Parents, Teachers, and Friends*, *Bees, Frogs, and Little Grass*, *Kittens, Puppies, and Big Trees*, and *Airplanes, Cannons, and Rockets*.

This is a series of colorful, high-quality, illustrated books in a 16-opening format. Each volume contains about 70-80 questions. Each page addresses one question. The illustrations take up a significant portion of the page, allowing children to enjoy them independently. The text is written in simple, easy-to-understand language, suitable for adults to read to children or for lower-grade students to read themselves.

Currently, there are approximately 60 million children aged 4 to 6 in China, and several million more in primary school. By the time these children reach the 21st century, they will have grown into young adults and become the masters of the nation. To meet the needs of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, these future masters of the nation must possess high moral and intellectual qualities!

Today, nurturing these young saplings with good soil, water, and fertilizer is a solemn and noble responsibility for every gardener and parent. It is with this sense of responsibility for our country’s future and with love for nearly 100 million children that I recommend this series of books to parents, kindergarten teachers, and primary school teachers.

    教育，从幼儿抓起
    ——向家长和教师推荐《幼儿十万个为什么》
    中国科普创作协会理事长  温济泽
    科学启示人们：从婴儿到7岁，是一个人智能发育最快的时期；如能及早注意幼儿教育，给他们在心理素质上和智力发育上打下良好的基础，对他们今后的成长，有关键的意义。
    最近四川少年儿童出版社开始出版一套精美的画册《幼儿十万个为什么》，第一批5册已经出书，我看了十分欣赏，非常喜欢。
    编这套画册的，是一批有经验的科普作家和儿童教育家。总主编是王国忠，就是60年代初期出版的那套颇受欢迎的少儿科普读物《十万个为什么》的主编。他们为了适应世界各国重视幼儿早期教育的潮流，探索和开拓我国幼儿早期教育的道路，从1986年秋起，就开始构思和设计这套画册。经过一年的辛苦努力，用通信、走访、座谈的方式，向17个省、市近100个幼儿园（包括乡村的、边远地区的和少数民族地区的）征集了近5000个问题。从中第一批选出了383个问题，分编成五册：《父母、老师和朋友》，《蜜蜂、青蛙和小草》，《小猫、小狗和大树》，《飞机、大炮和火箭》。
    这是一套彩色精印、图文并茂16开本的画册。每册有七八十个问题。每页一题。图画部分占较大的篇幅，可以让幼儿自己看，自己去欣赏。文字部分通俗口语，简明易懂，可以由大人念给幼儿听；低年级小学生也可以自己读。
    现在全国4至6岁的幼儿大约有6000万，还有几千万小学生。跨进21世纪时，今天的幼儿和少年，正好成长为青年，并将成长为国家的主人。适应中华民族伟大振兴的需要，作为国家的主人，需要具备何等高尚的思想品德素质和何等高度的科学文化素质！
    今天为这些小树苗培好土，浇好水，施好肥，又是每一个园丁和做父母的何等庄严与崇高的责任！我正是怀着这样对祖国未来的思念，怀着对近1亿个孩子们的一颗爱心，向家长、幼儿教师和初小教师推荐这套画册。
