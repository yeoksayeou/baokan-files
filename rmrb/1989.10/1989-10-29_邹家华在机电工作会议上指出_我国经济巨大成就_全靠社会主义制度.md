Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th.  People's Daily reporters Gu Honghong and Liu Liting report:

"In the past forty years, China has achieved remarkable economic construction achievements, and these achievements are the result of the socialist system, not any other system." Vice Premier Zhou Jiahua emphasized this fundamental experience in his speech at the Machinery and Electronics Industry Science and Technology and Quality Work Conference today.

He said that an important experience in China's economic development is that both too slow and too fast economic growth rates are not good. Too fast a rate, exceeding the society's economic bearing capacity, is also not good. This will cause the overall social economic imbalance. In recent years, China's economic development has had four "too fasts": first, the speed of basic construction is too fast; second, the speed of production growth is too fast; third, the growth of consumption funds is too fast; fourth, the speed of imports is too fast, especially the annual import of machinery and electronics products reaching 20 billion US dollars. These four "too fasts" inevitably bring about problems in finance, energy, and raw material supply, causing imbalances in the development of agriculture and industry, as well as imbalances within the industry. The central government proposed to carry out a three-year rectification and adjustment to solve these "too fasts" and imbalances, adhere to the socialist system, and make the economic development move towards a more coordinated path.

Zhou Jiahua emphasized that the machinery and electronics industry should make full use of the next few years to focus on technological progress and quality improvement. Enterprises should establish internal quality control standards that are higher than national standards.

    邹家华在机电工作会议上指出
　　我国经济巨大成就
　　全靠社会主义制度
    本报北京十月二十八日讯  新华社记者顾洪洪、本报记者刘丽天报道：“四十年来，我国经济建设取得了有目共睹的巨大成就，这个成就是依靠社会主义制度取得的，而不是依靠其他什么主义取得的。”国务委员邹家华今天在机电工业科技与质量工作会议上的讲话中强调了这一基本经验。
    他说，我国经济发展取得的一个重要经验就是，经济发展速度过慢不好，速度过快，超过了社会经济的承担能力也不好。这样会造成整个社会经济比例失调。前几年，我国经济发展中存在着四个过快：一是基本建设速度过快，二是生产增长速度过快，三是消费基金增长过快，四是进口增长速度过快，特别是机电产品年进口额达到二百亿美元。这四个过快必然带来金融、能源和原材料供应上的问题，造成了工农业生产发展比例失调以及工业内部发展比例失调。中央提出进行三年治理整顿，就是为了解决这几个过快和失调问题，坚持社会主义制度，使经济发展走上比较协调的道路。
    邹家华强调，机械电子行业要充分利用近几年时间着重在科技进步提高和质量方面下功夫。要建立高于国家标准的企业内控质量标准。
