**Investigate Every Report, Ensure Results — A Record of the Sixpan Water City Supervision Bureau's Complaint and Visitation Center**

In the fight against corruption, how can complaint and visitation work win the trust of the people? The experience of the Sixpan Water City Supervision Bureau's Complaint and Visitation Center is: investigate every report, ensure results, and periodically publish the outcomes to the public.

**As Long as There is Resolve, No Case is Too Complex to Solve**

Fabricating evidence and setting traps are common tactics used by those who abuse power for personal gain. Investigating a case is not an easy task.

On January 7th of this year, the Sixpan Water City Supervision Bureau's Complaint Center received a letter from the public reporting that the city's Vegetable and Aquatic Products Bureau's steel material quota had been sold by a construction team, earning nearly 3,000 yuan in profit. The Complaint Center immediately dispatched personnel to investigate. The investigation revealed that the construction team had sold 18 tons of steel material quota, earning a profit of 6,400 yuan. Why was this construction team able to sell the Vegetable and Aquatic Products Bureau's steel material quota? Was there any involvement from leaders? Was there any connection with the department in charge of steel material allocation? When the investigation team examined the accounts of the Materials Bureau, they found that someone had not notified the Vegetable and Aquatic Products Bureau of the 18 tons of steel material quota allocated to them but instead issued it to the construction team in the name of the Vegetable and Aquatic Products Bureau. Additionally, someone forged the signature of Li Guohui, the deputy principal of the City Ethnic Minority School, to obtain 5 tons of steel material quota from the City Planning Commission. After further investigation, it was discovered that Zhang Yikang, the deputy director of the Materials Bureau, had used his authority to steal the steel material in the name of the City Ethnic Minority School and privately allocated it to his relatives for building houses. The quota issued to the construction team was also his doing.

Director Zhao Shenshu of the Supervision Bureau said, "No matter how complex the case, as long as there is resolve, it can definitely be solved."

**Stand Firm Against Pressure, Uphold Discipline**

Every investigation faces interference. Regarding this, Zhao Shenshu and his colleagues say that objectively stating the facts is better than harsh words. Some officials, when found to have violated laws and regulations, would submit so-called "appeals" to higher-level leaders, causing leaders who do not know the truth to write comments and make phone calls. After receiving the instructions, the Complaint and Visitation Center does not refuse to act but instead sends the accurate investigation report directly to the leaders, making the higher-level leaders understand the truth and turning interference into support for the case. Some officials do not understand the law, commit illegal acts without knowing it, and start causing trouble when investigated. The colleagues from the Supervision Bureau patiently explain the relevant policies to them, turning their resistance into acceptance. For the few who cause trouble, they firmly push back.

The director of the City Tobacco Office, Yang Xuechao, borrowed 30,000 yuan from the collective in the name of the unit and gave it to his brother-in-law, Gong Zhimin, in Panzhou's Zhongyi District. Gong used the money to buy a private car. The Complaint Center, after investigation, confirmed that Yang Xuechao's actions constituted the misappropriation of public funds, a serious offense. Just as the case was being defined, Yang Xuechao went to the city leaders and to the Supervision Bureau to "petition," claiming he was wronged. The Complaint and Visitation Center of the Supervision Bureau repeatedly verified the case details, insisted on the correct definition, and recommended that the relevant departments remove his position.

After a case is solved, whether it can be handled properly and whether the handling is appropriate is what the complainants and the public are most concerned about and also the most difficult part. The Sixpan Water City Supervision Bureau has always insisted on solving one case and handling one case, never being swayed by relationships or the wind of interference. In March of this year, they verified through investigation that the deputy director of the City Construction Commission's Housing Management Office, Tian Wenjun, accepted the city's broadcast and television cable project using a company whose business license had been revoked by the Industrial and Commercial Administration, and falsified the project settlement, using fake invoices to settle, earning an illegal profit of 1,000 yuan. Just as they were preparing to seriously handle the case, some people came to find the bureau leaders and the case handlers to plead for leniency, requesting that the punishment not be too severe. They firmly resisted this interference and made the decision to give Tian a demerit, and confiscated the 1,000 yuan of illegal gains to the treasury.

**Supervision Work Relies on the Party Organization and the People**

For every case investigated, the Sixpan Water City Supervision Bureau publicizes the results in various forms, either by holding a press conference or by posting notices. Effective work is the most powerful language. Every time a notice is posted, crowds of onlookers gather, and people feel that the Complaint and Visitation Center is trustworthy and respectable. Thus, many people proactively provide them with leads and help them solve problems.

The director of the Shui City Grain Bureau, Li Yangming, although there had been reports of his disciplinary issues in the past and the organization had investigated him, all ended with "no evidence found." After seeing the Supervision Bureau's notice, the public came in person and wrote letters reporting Li Yangming's issues. Many informed individuals checked account books, found leads, and provided evidence, detailing Li Yangming's actions and methods of profiting from grain. What was even more touching was that the public also did ideological work among themselves, encouraging informed individuals to bravely expose and accuse. In just one month, it was found that Li Yangming and his wife had illegally operated 191,000 kg of negotiated-priced grain, evading 135,000 yuan in taxes, and it was also found that Li Yangming had arbitrarily approved the diversion of subsidized grain for negotiated sales, causing a loss of 435,000 yuan to the state. This case has been transferred to the judicial authorities for legal handling.

The leaders of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government also gave strong support to the Supervision Bureau. Mayor Guan Yanhua clearly told the city's officials, "All departments must support the work of the Supervision Bureau, speak for them when they encounter difficulties, and provide manpower when they lack strength!" Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Xia Guohua also said, "The comrades in the supervision department dare to handle cases boldly, which shows that we have used the right people, and we are happy about it!" Under the support of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, the Supervision Bureau also hired 27 retired cadres and members of democratic parties as special supervisory inspectors to assist the Municipal Supervision Bureau in its work. When some cases encounter difficulties and obstacles in their handling, the special supervisory inspectors use their identities and influence to consult, criticize, and offer suggestions, urging the relevant leaders and departments to solve problems.

Deputy Director of the Complaint and Visitation Center, Xiong Zhongfang, deeply felt, "With the support of the Party and the people, our anti-corruption struggle will definitely achieve results." Recently, the work of the Sixpan Water City Supervision Bureau was praised by the national supervision authorities.

    举必查  查必果
    ——记六盘水市监察局举报信访中心
    本报记者　罗盘
    在反腐败斗争中，举报信访工作如何取信于民？贵州省六盘水市监察局举报信访中心的经验是：举必查，查必果，定期将结果公布于众。
    只要下决心，就没有查不清的事儿
    弄虚作假，故布疑阵，是以权谋私者蒙骗调查的常用手腕。要查清一起案件，并非易事。
    今年1月7日，六盘水市监察局举报中心接到群众投书，举报市蔬菜水产局的基建钢材指标被一个包工队卖了10吨，从中牟利近3000元。监察局举报中心立即派人调查。结果查明，这个包工队前后倒卖钢材指标18吨，从中牟利6400元。为什么这个包工队敢于将水产局的钢材指标倒卖？这里面是不是还有领导干部插了手？跟主管钢材指标的物资部门有没有关联？调查组查看物资局的帐簿时，发现有人没有把分配给水产局的18吨钢材指标通知水产局，而是以水产局的名义批给了这个包工队。同时，还有人冒市民族中学副校长李国辉的签名，从市计委开出5吨钢材指标。经过深入调查，终于查明是物资局副局长张益康利用职权，盗用市民族中学名义，私自把钢材批给自己亲戚盖房子。批给包工队的指标，也是他干的。
    监察局局长赵身修说：“不管多么复杂的案情，只要有决心，就一定能弄个水落石出”。
    顶住阻力，严肃法纪
    每查一案，必有人说情。对此，赵身修和他的同事们说，客观地陈述事实，胜过严辞厉色。有的干部被查出有违法乱纪行为，便到上级领导那里投所谓的“申诉状”，致使不明真相的领导写了批语，打来电话。举报信访中心接到批示后，不是顶住不办，而是把准确的调查报告直接送到领导同志手中，使上级领导了解真象，变说情为支持办案。有的干部不懂法，干了违法的事还不知道，一被调查就上门吵闹。监察局的同志向他们耐心解释有关政策，变不服为心服口服。对极少数胡搅蛮缠的人，他们则毫不犹豫地顶回去。
    市烟草办公室主任杨学超假借单位名义，把集体的3万元人民币借给他在盘县忠义区的妹夫龚志明，龚拿到钱后，给自己买了私人汽车。举报中心经过调查，确认杨学超此举属于挪用公款，性质严重。正当此案定性之际，杨学超一边找市领导，一边到监察局“上访”，说冤枉了他。监察局举报信访中心反复核实案情，坚持正确的定性，建议有关部门撤销了他的职务。
    案件查清后，能不能处理下去，处理的结果是否恰当，举报人最关注，群众最敏感，难度也最大。六盘水市监察局始终坚持查实一件，处理一件，决不被关系网、说情风所左右。今年3月，他们经调查证实，市建委房管所副所长田文俊用一个已被工商部门注销执照的企业接受市广播电视架线工程，并在工程决算中弄虚作假，用假发票决算，从中牟利1000元。正当他们准备严肃处理的时候，一些人来找局领导和办案的同志说情，要求处理不要太重。他们坚决顶住了这股说情风，作出了给田记过处分的决定，并将其非法牟取的1000元收缴财政。
    监察工作要依靠党组织和人民群众
    凡是查处的案件，六盘水市监察局都以不同形式公之于众，或召开新闻发布会，或张贴公告。卓有成效的工作，是最有力的语言。每次公告一贴出去，围观的群众络绎不绝，人们感到举报信访中心可信、可敬。于是，许多人主动给他们提供线索，帮助他们查清问题。
    水城县粮食局局长李杨明，虽然过去有人反映过他的违纪问题，组织上也曾对他进行过审查，但都以“查无实据”告终。群众看了监察局的公告后，纷纷来人来信反映李杨明的问题，很多知情人翻帐本、找线索、出证明，一件件、一桩桩地详细讲述李杨明以粮谋私的行为和手段。更使人感动的是，群众之间还互相作思想工作，动员知情人大胆揭发检举，短短一个月的时间，就查明李杨明与其妻非法经营议价粮食191万多公斤，偷税13.5万元，还查明李杨明擅自批准挪用平价粮作议价销售，给国家造成43.5万元的损失。此案已移交司法机关依法处理。
    六盘水市市委和市政府领导同志也给监察局以有力的支持。市长管彦鹤对全市干部明确说：“各机关都要支持监察局的工作，在他们受到刁难时为他们说话，在他们力量不足时出人出力！”市委书记夏国华还说：“监察部门的同志敢于大胆办案，说明我们用对了人，我们感到高兴！”
    在市委、市政府领导的支持下，监察局还聘请了27名老干部和民主党派人士作为特邀监察员，协助市监察局工作。当一些案件的查处碰到困难和阻力时，特邀监察员就利用他们的身份和影响，以咨询、批评、提意见等方式，督促有关领导和部门解决。
    举报信访中心副主任熊中芳深有感触地说：“有了党和人民群众的支持，我们的反腐败斗争一定可以取得成绩。”不久前，六盘水市监察局的工作受到国家监察部门的表扬。
