The second China Arts Festival featured two performances of Beijing opera excerpts by opera troupes from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as the China Academy of Traditional Opera. The performances were highly enjoyable. They showcased a group of new stars who have emerged in recent years, including dan (female roles), wusheng (martial roles), xiaosheng (young male roles), and laodan (old female roles). Each performer demonstrated a common trait: they all have good teachers and a solid foundation. Their singing, speaking, and martial arts skills are all solid and genuine. In the current economic difficulties faced by Beijing opera troupes, many young artists are easily swayed and change professions, seeking better opportunities elsewhere. However, these performers remain steadfast in their commitment, dedicating themselves to practice and achieving outstanding results. Their perseverance in the art of Beijing opera is truly commendable and worthy of praise. The audience, in their admiration, enthusiastically applauded the performers and their teachers for the hard work they put into rehearsals, celebrating the success of the performances.

In "Sixth Month Snow," Yuan Yingming's portrayal of Dou E, in "Heavenly Maid Scattering Flowers," Lei Ying's portrayal of the heavenly maiden, in "Morning Bell Awakens a Dream," Wang Rongrong's portrayal of Du Liniang, in "Broken Bridge," Dong Yuanyuan's portrayal of Bai Suzhen, and Zhang Guiqin's portrayal of Xiaoqing, each brought unique characteristics and new interpretations to these well-known traditional roles. Dou E's sorrow and indignation, the heavenly maiden's elegance and grace, Du Liniang's resentment and purity, Bai Suzhen's loyalty and love, and Xiaoqing's frankness and integrity were all beautifully expressed through refined singing and dancing, without losing the distinctive styles of their respective schools. The performances included elements of the Wang (Yaoting) school's elegance and clarity, the Mei (Lanfang) school's precision and solemnity, and the Zhang (Junqiu) school's strength and splendor, providing a feast for the eyes.

In "Dueling with Flowers," Yuan Huichun's portrayal of Jiang Guizhi in the "Nostalgia" scene, with over a hundred lines of old female role singing, was seamless and flawless. The changing melodies effectively conveyed the character's emotional ups and downs, with both soft and powerful vocal techniques, maintaining the unique flavor and strength of old female role singing, leaving a deep impression. "Lu Cheng Calls at the Pass" is a small male role singing opera, and Jiang Qihu's portrayal of Lu Cheng, inheriting the style of Ye (Shenglan), showcased a natural and unrestrained performance. He also played Xu Xian in "Broken Bridge," a small male role, and managed to avoid any martial arts influence, making the performance natural and unrestrained.

Zhou Long's portrayal of Gao Chun in "Carrying the Flowery Carriage," Zhao Yongwei's portrayal of Xu Minggao in "Snail Valley," and Deng Min's portrayal of Lu Wenchong in "Eight Hammers" were all outstanding. Zhao Yongwei's hammer-wielding, throwing, and passing were agile and varied, with precise and stable movements, often completing complex actions while flipping and posing, showcasing the character's martial prowess. Deng Min's martial arts skills have also improved. In the "wheel battle" scene, her left and right "heavenly stirrups" movements were steady and solid. In the fighting and double-gun dancing scenes, she was not sluggish, displaying the proud and arrogant demeanor of a young general. Zhou Long, in "Rising to Power," "Walking the Edge," "Great Battle," and "Carrying the Carriage," each scene showcased his unique skills. Every move was clean and precise, orderly and cautious, fast but not chaotic, urgent but not rushed, consistently highlighting the character's brave and loyal general demeanor.

However, there were also some regrets. The performances lacked a full range of roles, such as the absence of new talents in the lao sheng (old male roles), wen jing (civilian roles), and chou (clown roles). If there is a bias in talent cultivation, it is worth noting.

　　可贵的执著精神——观两台京剧折子戏
　　钮骠
    第二届中国艺术节的节目中，有两台由京、津、沪三个京剧院团和中国戏曲学院演出的折子戏，观后很使人欣悦。它展示了近年来京剧舞台上脱颖而出的一批新星，包括了旦角、武生、小生、老旦几个行当。他们在台上体现了一个共同的特点，就是个个师承好、功底厚。文的唱念功，武的腰腿功都扎扎实实，见真功夫。在当下京剧演出团体经济拮据，许多从艺的青年人，见异思迁，纷纷跳槽改行、各奔前程的情势下，他们却能守志不渝，潜心研练，肯吃这份儿苦，作出出色的成绩，这种对京剧艺术的执著精神，是十分可贵而可嘉的。剧场中，观众们在啧啧称赞之余，情不自禁地以热情的掌声，回报了演员们和他们的教师在排练中共同流淌的汗水，鼓励演出的成功。
      《六月雪》中袁英明的窦娥、《天女散花》中雷英的天女、《晨钟惊梦》中王容容的杜十娘、《断桥》中董元元的白娘子、张桂琴的小青，演来各有各的面貌，个性鲜明，并为这些在传统戏中早已有过的人物形象赋予了新意。窦娥的悲切激愤，天女的华贵飘逸，杜十娘的怨愤高洁，白娘子的坚贞多情，小青的爽朗正直，都能以精致的歌舞表做表现得恰到好处，并不失其所宗师的流派特色。既有王（瑶卿）派的婉约明快，也有梅（兰芳）派的工整端重，又有张（君秋）派的刚劲华丽……，确能给人以赏心悦目之娱。
      《对花枪》“怀旧”一场中，袁慧琴扮演的姜桂枝，以一百多句之长的老旦唱段，贯穿通场，一气呵成，随着变幻无穷的旋律，把人物情绪的起伏跌宕，以或低回、或高亢的运腔烘托出来，又不失老旦唱工应有的“味儿”和“劲儿”，给人留下的印象也是深刻的。《罗成叫关》是一出小生唱工戏，江其虎演的罗成，承继了叶（盛兰）派，一条天赋的铁嗓，听之真是淋漓痛快。他还在《断桥》中扮演许仙，属于文生，也能做到飘洒自然，脱却武气。
    周龙在《挑华车》中演的高宠，赵永伟在《螺蛳峪》中演的徐鸣皋，邓敏在《八大锤》中演的陆文龙，也当属上乘。赵永伟的舞锤，扔接传递，灵捷多变，出手准确，稳中带俏，况且许多繁难动作都是伴随着翻身、亮相同时完成的，表现了人物的英武气概。邓敏的武功技艺也有进步，她在“车轮战”中的嬉戏中，左右“朝天镫”三起三落，显得稳当扎实，在对打和舞双枪中，不拖泥带水，俨然是一派心高气傲的少年小将丰采。周龙在“起霸”、“走边”、“大战”、“挑车”每场中都能各显身手，每一招一式，干净利落，工整谨饬，快而不乱，急而不火，从始至终紧紧围绕着展示人物骁勇善战、以身许国的大将风度而舞而做。
    看了这两台戏，也有憾处，即显得行当不全，如老生、文净、丑行新人都没能登台一显身手。如果是在培养人材的视向中有失偏颇，就值得注意了。
