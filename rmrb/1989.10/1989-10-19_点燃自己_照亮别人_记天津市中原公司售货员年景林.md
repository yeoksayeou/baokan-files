Someone commented that Beijing Department Store's senior salesperson Zhang Binggui is "a flame," while Tianjin City Zhongyuan Company's salesperson Nian Jinglin is "a heart full of affection." Nian Jinglin treats every customer as if they were his own family. Salespersons at Zhongyuan Company introduced that as soon as Master Nian enters the counter, it's like an actor stepping onto the stage. His mouth never stops, his hands never stop, as he introduces products to customers, acting as their consultant, completing the work of two or three people. His face is always lit up with a smile, no matter what happens at home, he never shows any displeasure in front of customers. Fellow salespersons say, "Master Nian is 62 years old, who knows where he gets so much energy? Young people couldn't handle working like him every day."

Nian Jinglin stands behind the counter but his heart is with countless customers from all over the country. Statistics show that, except for Tibet and Taiwan, people from every province, municipality, and autonomous region in the country have written to him to order clothes. Although these customers rarely consider the burden Master Nian has to bear, he treats every letter as if it were a personal request from a family member, handling each one seriously. A young woman from Jiangxi, with an average figure and darker skin, had been troubled for years because she couldn't find a satisfactory dress. She wrote a letter half-believing, half-doubting, asking Master Nian to design a new style of dress that wouldn't make her look tall, thin, or dark. After receiving the letter, Nian Jinglin observed the crowd every day to see if there was anyone with a similar figure and what kind of dress would suit them. He imagined the Jiangxi woman's figure and drew several sketches, then sent them along with four selected fabric samples to Jiangxi. After receiving her reply, Nian Jinglin made a dress in the style she chose, a new and fashionable mustard yellow dress. The young woman wrote back, "Master Nian, you sent me more than just a dress, you also taught me how to be a person. I will treat others with the same heart you showed me..."

Nian Jinglin said, "I want to light myself to illuminate others." For customers with special difficulties, he doesn't consider personal gain or loss, serving them wholeheartedly. He often delivers goods to blind factories in his spare time; for bedridden patients, he measures and tailors clothes by their bedside; during the Spring Festival, he persuades his wife to make funeral clothes at home...

Nian Jinglin has been standing behind the counter since 1958. He says, "Studying technology is to better serve customers, but relying on one person's strength, no matter how good the technology is, it's useless." He firmly believes in Comrade Lei Feng's words: "A single flower is not spring, but a garden of flowers in full bloom is spring." For a long time, Nian Jinglin has selflessly shared his counter service experience and skills with his colleagues. In 1984, he overcame his lack of education and used more than a year of spare time to write a nearly 10,000-word book titled "Counter Service Q&A," detailing his experiences in polite customer service, language art, and how to handle returns and exchanges. With the support of the Zhongyuan Company Party Committee and higher-level leaders, Nian Jinglin's experience was promoted throughout the city's financial and trade system.

Nian Jinglin often keeps the cultivation of young people in mind. In recent years, he has invested a lot of effort in training apprentices. Master Nian teaches them hand in hand, letting them stand independently at the counter, while he observes from the side. Through Master's teaching and personal example, the apprentices have made rapid progress.

The news of Master Nian training apprentices spread, and many external units sent apprentices to his door. An area chief even personally asked Master Nian to train a few apprentices for them. Now, he has signed apprenticeship contracts with 57 young workers in the store and 18 advanced young people outside the store.

Before the Cultural Revolution, Nian Jinglin was repeatedly evaluated as an advanced worker in his unit and the city. When asked why he was so active, he said, "At that time, I only knew that socialism was ours, and we had to repay the country!" After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Nian Jinglin joined the Party. Especially after becoming a labor model for Tianjin City and the nation, he puts the interests of the Party and the people first in everything he does. For a time, the practice of treating guests and giving gifts became prevalent in society, and this trend also blew to the counter. Famous cigarettes, famous liquor, local specialties, and even cash were repeatedly sent to Nian Jinglin, but he politely declined, whether in public or private. He set two rules for himself: not to do anything that damages the Party's reputation, and not to do anything that violates policies.

    点燃自己  照亮别人
    ——记天津市中原公司售货员年景林
    本报记者  梅洪如
    有人评述，北京市百货大楼特级售货员张秉贵是“一团火”，天津市中原公司售货员年景林是“一片情”。年景林把每一位顾客都当作自己的亲人。中原公司的售货员介绍，年师傅一进柜台，就像演员登上了舞台，嘴不停、手不停地给顾客介绍商品，当参谋，一人完成两三个人的售货任务。他脸上总是堆着笑，不管家里发生多大的事，从不见他在顾客面前流露过不愉快。同台的售货员说，年师傅六十二岁了，也不知他怎么那么大的劲儿，年轻人每天像他那样干都顶不住。年景林身在柜台内，心系着天南地北无数顾客。据统计，除西藏、台湾外，全国各省、市、自治区都有慕名向他投书求购衣服的。尽管这些顾客很少考虑到年师傅难以承受的负担，但他只要收到信件，就如同接受亲人的委托一样，件件认真照办。江西有位姑娘，身材一般，皮肤较黑，多年来为没穿上称心的连衣裙而苦恼。她半信半疑地写了一封信，要年师傅为她设计一件不显高、不显瘦、不显黑的新款式连衣裙。年景林收信后，每天观察人群里有没有像她那样体型的人，看她们穿什么样的裙子得体。并想象江西姑娘的轮廓画了几个图案，然后连同选好的四块料样寄往江西。回信后，年景林按照她选中的样子做了一件款式新颖的芥茉黄色连衣裙。姑娘穿上这裙子，在回信中写道：“年师傅，您寄来的何止是一件裙子，您还教会了我怎样做人。我要用您待我之心，去待他人……”
    年景林说，他要点燃自己，照亮别人。对于有特殊困难的顾客，他更不顾个人得失，全心全意为他们服务。盲人工厂，他经常业余送货上门；瘫痪病人，他到床头量体裁衣；新春佳节，他说服老伴儿在家里为死者赶制丧服……年景林把一个普通成衣售货员的份外事揽作份内事，长期以来为企业赢得了巨大的信誉和经济效益。
    年景林一九五八年开始站柜台。他说，钻研技术是为了更好地为顾客服务，但是光靠一个人的力量，技术再好也没有用。他笃信雷锋同志的话：“一朵鲜花不是春，万紫千红春满园。”长期以来，年景林毫不保留地把自己站柜台的经验和技术传授给同行。一九八四年他克服文化低的困难，利用一年多业余时间写出了一本近万字的《柜台服务问答》，详细地记述了礼貌待客、语言艺术和怎样处理好退换货等经验。在中原公司党委和上级领导支持下，年景林的经验在全市财贸系统推广。
    年景林时常把培养年轻人放在心头。近年，他在带徒弟上费了很多心血。年师傅手把手地教他们，让他们独立站柜台，自己在一旁观察。经过师傅的言传身教，徒弟们进步很快。
    年师傅带徒弟的事传出去了，许多外单位都送徒弟上门，有个区长也亲自找老年，要求为他们带几个徒弟。如今，他已和店内的五十七名青工、店外的十八名先进青年签了师徒合同。
    年景林“文革”前就多次被评为单位和市里的先进工作者。问他为什么那么积极，他说：“当时只知道社会主义是自己的，要报国啊！”十一届三中全会以后，年景林入了党。特别是在当了天津市和全国劳动模范以后，他更是事事都以党和人民的利益为重。社会上一度盛行请客送礼，这股风也刮到了柜台上。名烟、名酒、土特产，甚至钞票无数次送到年景林面前，而他不管是公开场合还是私下活动，一律婉言谢绝。他给自己定了两条戒律：败坏党的声誉的事情不干，违反政策的事情不干。
