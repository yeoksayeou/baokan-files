    Domestic Component Production Reaches 90% for Color TVs
    Foreign Exchange Usage for TV Components Drops from $60 to $20 per Unit
    Significant Progress in Domestic Production of Color TVs

    By People's Daily Reporter Cui Xiuzhi

    China's color television industry has rapidly improved its domestic production levels through technology introduction and upgrades, driving the development of national industries and achieving significant economic and social benefits. It has become a key industry in the electronics sector.

    Starting with Macroeconomic Control

    People may still remember that China introduced its first color TV production line in 1979. In the following years, due to weak macroeconomic control, some regions and enterprises, driven by short-term gains, indiscriminately imported over 100 assembly production lines without considering the difficulty or level of the technology. These scattered imports posed significant challenges to domestic production. Foreign companies frequently updated their products, releasing "high-end models," and some enterprises followed suit, making it difficult to proceed with domestic production.

    The lessons learned have made it clear that China's color TV industry cannot be controlled by others. Faced with a large and chaotic market and a variety of models, where should we start? The decision-making bodies decided to start with strengthening macroeconomic control, systematic planning, and step-by-step adjustments.

    To quickly achieve domestic production of color TVs, the former Ministry of Electronics established a color TV domestic production leadership group, with Deputy Minister Zhang Xuedong as the head. After the first national color TV domestic production conference in 1985, it was clear that color TV domestic production is a crucial strategic issue related to the long-term interests of the state, the revitalization of the electronics industry, and the improvement of the material and cultural lives of hundreds of millions of people. This has gradually moved the work of color TV domestic production from chaos to a systematic development track with leadership, goals, plans, and steps.

    Some people think that color TV domestic production is simply about how many domestic components are used in a complete machine. In fact, this view is not comprehensive. Color TV domestic production is a policy-intensive, technology-intensive systematic project, and it is also a long-term, ongoing work with continuously deepening content. From product design to development; from complete machine domestic production to components, equipment, instruments, molds, and raw materials; from product optimization to standard setting, to achieving standardization, serialization, and generalization, the workload is enormous, the scope is wide, the technical difficulty is high, and each aspect must be considered from the overall development of the electronics industry.

    To enhance the transparency and clarity of color TV domestic production, the second national color TV domestic production conference in 1986 proposed the principles and guidelines for the systematic project of color TV domestic production as the development plan for the "Seventh Five-Year Plan."

    Systematic Planning Yields Results

    Over the past few years, color TV domestic production has been carried out in stages and levels according to the planned goals, achieving significant results. According to incomplete statistics, since 1987, the country has invested several hundred million yuan and used several million dollars in foreign exchange to add more than 40 new color TV component production lines, greatly enhancing the comprehensive matching capabilities of color TVs. Currently, 65 items of small-class components for complete machine matching have 56 items used in complete machine production, achieving 90% batch domestic production. The foreign exchange used for components per color TV has dropped from $60 to $20. Among them, 1.5 million color TVs have reduced foreign exchange usage from $200 to $20 per unit.

    In the process of developing color TV domestic production, the breakthrough of many projects has driven the development of the foundation industry, improved product quality, and enhanced domestic matching capabilities. The Tianjin Electronic Mold Factory uses computer-aided design and manufacturing molds, with a short production cycle, high precision, and meeting design requirements in one go, raising the level of domestic mold design and manufacturing, which was previously a bottleneck for the industry.

    Raw materials are the foundation of achieving color TV domestic production. With the active cooperation of the Ministry of Metallurgy, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Petrochemical Corporation, the State Bureau of Building Materials, and other material industry departments, materials urgently needed for color TVs such as non-magnetic, spring stainless steel strips, photoresist, special gases, and graphite milk have been successfully developed. Some of these materials have reached the level of similar foreign products. Just these few items can save hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign exchange annually.

    The Wuxi Microelectronics United Company produces integrated circuits, with a domestic production rate of 98.3% for the 1846 required material specifications.

    Independent Development Opens New Paths

    The process of color TV domestic production is essentially a process of technological progress. In recent years, the color TV domestic production leadership group has always focused on complete machines as the leader of domestic production, with the optimization of complete machine technology as the key. They have jointly developed and tackled key problems, implementing extensive economic and technological cooperation, opening up new paths for systematic domestic production. The six complete machine factories and units such as Tsinghua University and Tianjin University participating in the optimization design of complete machines have formed two complete machine optimization design groups, working closely together. The two groups have successively launched six new models, with more than 20 key parts optimized in design, quality superior to the original machine, and the domestic production level of complete machines reaching over 95%. The total foreign exchange used for a set of color TV components has been reduced from $60 to less than $7.

    More encouragingly, in the process of color TV domestic production, China's color TV industry has moved from the level of simple assembly to the new stage of being able to independently design and develop complete machines. Especially the use of computer-aided design for complete machine development has achieved significant results. Recently, the independently designed and developed 21-inch flat-screen remote control color TV marks that China's color TV domestic production has entered the stage of independent design, proving that China has the ability to design and develop complete color TV machines. In the future, model updates will no longer require repeated imports.

    The degree of domestic production continues to improve, and the quality of color TVs has not only not declined but has steadily improved. The overall quality level of the products has fully approached or reached the advanced level of the 1980s worldwide, with dozens of factories winning first prizes.

    Color TV domestic production is a challenging path, but it has accumulated more experience. Of course, there is still a distance to fully implement domestic production. The most prominent current issue is that a large number of high-value electronic specialty materials urgently need domestic production; the domestic production of specialty equipment, instruments, molds, and other tools needs to be further deepened; the matching capabilities of color TV picture tubes and some components need to quickly catch up with the domestic production of complete machines to meet the needs of batch production. Some technically challenging "hard" projects and raw materials require further joint efforts among departments.

    批量生产的国产化元器件占90％
    每台彩电元器件用汇从60美元降到20美元
    彩电国产化迈出坚实步伐
    本报记者  崔秀之
    我国的彩电工业，通过技术引进和技术改造，国产化水平迅速提高，推动了民族工业的发展，带来了明显的经济效益和社会效益，成为电子工业的重点产业。
    从宏观控制着手
    人们可能还会记得，我国是1979年引进第一条彩电生产线的。在以后几年内，由于宏观控制不力，一些地方和企业从追求近期效益出发，不分难易，不分层次，竞相引进100多条组装生产线。这些多头引进给国产化带来了很大困难。外国公司又不断将产品改型，不时地抛出“高档机”，一些企业跟在后面转，使彩电国产化无从下手。
    教训，使人们逐步明白，我国彩电工业的发展决不能受制于人。面对大而乱的摊子，庞杂的机型，从哪儿抓起？决策部门决定，从加强宏观控制着手，系统安排，逐项理顺。
    为了尽快实现彩电国产化，原电子工业部成立了彩电国产化领导小组，由副部长张学东任组长。1985年召开了全国第一次彩电国产化会议之后，明确了彩电国产化是关系到国家长远利益、电子工业振兴和提高亿万群众物质文化生活水平的重要战略；使彩电国产化工作从散乱中逐步走上有领导、有目标、有计划、有步骤的系统发展轨道。
    有人认为，彩电国产化就是看一个整机上用多少国产元器件，其实这种看法是不全面的。彩电国产化是一项政策性、技术性强的系统工程，也是一项内容不断深化发展的长期持久性工作。从产品设计到开发；从整机国产化到元器件、设备仪器工模具、原材料的国产化；从产品创优到标准的制定，直到实现标准化、系列化、通用化等方面，工作量大，涉及面广，技术难度高，各项都必须从电子工业发展全局考虑。
    为了增强彩电国产化的透明度和清晰度，1986年，全国第二次彩电国产化会议提出了彩电国产化系统工程的方针和原则，作为“七五”期间彩电国产化发展规划。
    系统安排见成效
    几年来，彩电国产化按照预期目标，分层次、分阶段逐项进行，取得了显著效果。据不完全统计，1987年以来，全国投资几亿元，用汇几千万元，新增彩电配套元器件生产线40多条，大大增强了彩电综合配套能力。目前，65项为整机配套的小类品种元器件，已有56项用于整机生产，使批量国产化达到90％，每台彩电元器件用汇从60美元降到20美元。其中，有150万台彩电的批量，用汇从200美元降到20美元。
    在彩电国产化的发展过程中，不少项目的突破，带动了基础工业的发展，提高了产品的质量和国内配套能力。天津电讯模具厂用计算机辅助设计和制造的模具，投产周期短，精度高，一次达到设计要求，使国内工业卡脖子的模具设计和制造，上了一个台阶。
    原材料是实现彩电国产化的基础。在冶金部、化工部、石化总公司、国家建材局等材料工业部门的积极配合下，研制成功彩电急需的无磁、弹簧不锈钢带、光刻胶、特种气体、石墨乳等材料，有的质量基本达到国外同类产品实物水平。仅此几项，每年可节省外汇几百万美元。
      无锡微电子联合公司生产的集成电路，所需用的1846种材料规格中，国产化率达98.3％。
    自主开发创新路
    彩电国产化过程，实质是一个技术进步的过程。近几年，彩电国产化领导小组始终将整机作为国产化的龙头，以整机优选技术为重点，联合开发共同攻关，实行经济技术上的广泛联合，为成龙配套地进行国产化开拓了新路子。参加整机优化设计的6个整机厂和清华大学、天津大学等单位，组成两个整机优化设计组，密切协作。两组先后推出的6种新机型，有20多个重点部位通过优化设计，质量优于原机，整机国产化程度达到95％以上。全套彩电元器件用汇从60美元降到7美元以下。
    更为可喜的是，在彩电国产化进程中，我国彩电工业已从简单组装的水平，跨进了能够自主设计开发整机的新阶段。尤其是采用计算机辅助设计用于整机开发，收到了显著效果。最近，自主设计开发的21英寸直角平面遥控彩电，标志着我国彩电国产化跨入了自主设计的新阶段，证实了我国已具备设计开发彩电整机的能力。今后，机型的更新不需要反复进口了。
    国产化的程度不断提高，彩电的质量不仅没有下降，反而稳步提高。产品质量的整体水平已全面接近或达到八十年代世界先进水平，获得一等奖的厂家达几十个之多。
    彩电国产化是一条艰辛的路，然而，积累的更多的是经验。当然，全面实行国产化还有一段距离。当前最突出的问题是数量大、使用面广、价值高的电子专用材料，急待国产化；专用设备、仪器工模具国产化要进一步深入展开；彩电显象管和部分元器件的配套能力，尽快跟上整机国产化的步伐，满足批量生产的需要。有些技术难度大的“骨头”项目和原材料，有待于部门间进一步联合攻关。
