On October 1st, the capital, bathed in brilliant sunshine, was adorned with flowers and green trees, filled with laughter and joy.

At the flower bed near the Fuxingmen Overpass, crowds gathered. Some were admiring the flowers, some were taking photos, and others were resting and chatting. People were immersed in the autumn sunshine and the fragrance of the flowers for the National Day.

At 10:40 AM, a white van pulled up gently by the side of the bridge. A group of people who looked like officials got off the car. The person in front was tall and sturdy, wearing a blue Zhongshan suit.

The people enjoying the holiday on the green lawn did not notice their arrival. A young man who was fiddling with a camera suddenly looked up and was startled: "Hey, isn't that Comrade Jiang Zemin?!"

"General Secretary!" Everyone's gaze turned to him. Jiang Zemin smiled and waved to the crowd.

Today, Jiang Zemin, along with Li Ruihuan, Li Tieying, Li Ximing, and Ding Guanggen, went to visit comrades who were working on the front lines during the holiday. As their car passed the Fuxingmen Bridge, they saw many people gathered here and decided to stop the car to greet them.

Jiang Zemin first walked towards a People's Liberation Army soldier who was on duty. The soldier stepped down from the guard post, took two steps forward, and stood at attention to salute the General Secretary. Jiang Zemin extended his strong hands: "Happy holiday!" and asked, "Comrade, where are you from?"

"Jiangsu Xinghua." The soldier replied shyly.

"Oh, we are fellow countrymen, I am from Yangzhou." Jiang Zemin said warmly.

Looking at the soldier with sweat on his head, the General Secretary said, "You have worked hard. Please convey my holiday greetings to the broad cadres and soldiers of the martial law troops!"

Seeing Jiang Zemin talking warmly with the soldier, people flocked over. A little girl in a red dress ran towards Jiang Zemin, extending her small hand. Jiang Zemin happily shook the little girl's hand, saying, "Hello! Hello!"

Standing by, Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan praised, "This is a brave child."

The children who were a bit timid just now now all eagerly extended their small hands and shouted, "Grandpa, happy holiday!"

Jiang Zemin, Li Ruihuan, and other comrades shook hands with the children, saying happily, "Children, happy holiday!"

Seeing a girl with a "lucky mole" on her forehead, Jiang Zemin said to her mother, "In my hometown, there is also this custom. When I was a child, I also had a red mole." The General Secretary's warm words made everyone laugh.

Two couples dressed in formal attire pushed through the crowd to tell the General Secretary that they had just gotten married and were happy to see the central leaders on National Day. Jiang Zemin cupped his hands in congratulations: "Congratulations on your new marriage, congratulations on your new marriage!"

Li Ruihuan and other comrades also chatted warmly with the crowd. Li Ruihuan asked, "It's National Day, are you having a good holiday?"

"Very good!" Everyone laughed in unison.

More and more people gathered, and everyone eagerly shook hands with the General Secretary and other central leaders, creating a very warm and lively atmosphere.

"Shall we take a group photo?" Ding Guanggen suggested.

"Good!" A cheer went up from the crowd.

Jiang Zemin and other comrades stood with the crowd dressed in holiday attire and let the reporters take memorable photos. A young man handed his camera to a reporter, eagerly saying, "Please help me take a photo. I want to keep this beautiful memory."

Before getting into the car, Jiang Zemin and other comrades shook hands with the people of the capital and the soldiers of the martial law troops once more. Jiang Zemin said loudly, "Comrades, goodbye! We must work together to build our country well. Everyone, work hard!"

"Goodbye!" The people waved goodbye to Jiang Zemin and other comrades, watching the car drive away.

    总书记的问候
    新华社记者　邹爱国  中央人民广播电台记者　罗观星
    10月1日，沐浴着灿烂阳光的首都，处处是鲜花绿树，处处是欢声笑语。
    复兴门立交桥的花坛旁，人群熙攘。有人在观花，有人在拍照，有人在休息谈笑。人们沉浸在秋日的阳光和国庆的花香之中。
    上午10时40分，一辆乳白色的面包车在桥旁轻轻停下。一群干部模样的人走下车来，最前面的那位身材魁梧，身着蓝色中山服。
    在绿茵草地上欢度节日的人们，没有注意到他们的到来。一个摆弄相机的小伙子猛地抬起头，怔住了：“呀，这不是江泽民同志吗？！”
    “总书记！”人们的目光不约而同地投了过来。江泽民笑着向大家招手。
    江泽民同志今天上午和李瑞环、李铁映、李锡铭、丁关根同志一起去慰问节日坚持在第一线工作的同志们。车过复兴门桥头，看到这里的群众很多，他临时决定停车，看望大家。
    江泽民首先向一名正在执勤的人民解放军战士走去。那位战士走下岗哨，向前走了两步，立正向总书记行军礼。江泽民向他伸过有力的双手：“节日好！”并问：“同志，你是哪儿人？”
    “江苏兴化。”战士腼腆地答道。
    “哦，我们是老乡啊，我是扬州人。”江泽民亲切地说。
    望着满头是汗的战士，总书记说：“你们辛苦了，请转达我对戒严部队广大指战员的节日问候！”
    看到江泽民同志和战士亲切交谈，人们“哗”地一下聚拢过来。一个身着红色衣裙的小姑娘朝江泽民奔来，伸出了小手。江泽民高兴地握着小姑娘的手，连声说：“你好！你好！”
    在一旁的中共中央政治局常委李瑞环称赞说：“这是个勇敢的孩子。”
    刚才还有点胆怯的几个孩子，这时都抢着伸过了小手，并高声喊道：“爷爷，节日好！”
    江泽民、李瑞环等同志边同孩子们握手边高兴地说：“小朋友们，节日好！”
    看到一个女孩子额头点有“吉祥痣”，江泽民对她的母亲说：“我的家乡也有这个风俗，小时候我也点过红痣。”总书记亲切的话语，逗得大家笑了起来。
    两对身着礼服的男女青年挤过人群告诉总书记，他们刚结婚，今天是国庆节，能见到中央领导同志，感到很高兴。江泽民拱手祝贺：“新婚志喜，新婚志喜！”
    李瑞环等同志也和群众亲切交谈起来。李瑞环问大家：“国庆了，你们节日过得好吗？”
    “很好！”大家齐声笑答。
    人们越来越多，大家争相同总书记和中央其他领导同志握手，气氛十分亲切、热烈。
    “我们一起照张像好不好？”丁关根同志提议说。
    “好！”人群中发出了欢呼声。
    江泽民等同志和身着节日服装的群众挤在一起，让记者们拍下一张张难忘的照片。一个小伙子把相机递给一位记者，急切地说：“请你帮我拍一张，我要留下这美好的纪念。”
    江泽民等同志在临上车前，又一次同首都群众和戒严部队战士握手。江泽民高声说“同志们，再见！我们要同心协力，把国家建设好。大家要加油干啊！”
    “再见！”人们向江泽民等同志挥手告别，目送旅行车远去。（附图片）
