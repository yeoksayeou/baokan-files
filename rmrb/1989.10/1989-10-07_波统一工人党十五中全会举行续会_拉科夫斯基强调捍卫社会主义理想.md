The Polish United Workers' Party held the continuation of its 15th Plenary Session on October 3 in Warsaw. The session passed a resolution on convening the Party's 11th Congress and a document titled "The Party's Stance on Major Tasks Before the 11th Congress."

This continuation is the second stage of the 15th Plenary Session, which began on September 18. Party Central Committee Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary Mielczarek reported on the recent opinion poll results and suggestions within the Party. He stated that the poll results showed that the majority of Party members support the direct election of delegates to the 11th Congress by Party members. The Plenary Session decided to convene the 11th Congress on January 27, 1990. Before that, the entire Party will discuss the future form of Polish socialism, the Party's model, and program goals.

The document "The Party's Stance on Major Tasks Before the 11th Congress" emphasizes the need to "fundamentally change the Polish United Workers' Party," making it a "democratic, socialist left-wing party" that can "resist right-wing forces and factional pressures." The document stresses the need to defend the Party's political unity in the current situation.

The document states that the Polish United Workers' Party supports the reform of ownership relations to combine production efficiency, rational distribution, and worker participation in management. It advocates for diverse ownership forms but "opposes the sale of all or the basic part of social property to private individuals." The new Polish government has decided to implement a "free market economy" in Poland and will take some austerity measures to overcome economic difficulties. On this issue, the Polish Party advocates that all measures should not harm the interests of the working people.

In this document, the Polish Party expresses its appreciation for the declaration by the new government led by Solidarity, which states that officials will be appointed based on professional knowledge and loyalty to the state. At the same time, it expresses concern about instances where this principle is violated in practice. The document states, "We will resolutely oppose all non-substantive personnel purges."

Before the Plenary Session closed, Polish Party Central Committee First Secretary Rakowski delivered a closing speech. He called on members of the Polish United Workers' Party to remain loyal and defend the socialist ideal, "opposing all attempts to steer Poland away from the path of socialist development."

Rakowski said that after the Polish United Workers' Party's defeat in the June parliamentary elections, anti-communist elements and political enemies of the Polish United Workers' Party called for the Party to withdraw from the political stage, and some confused ideas and views emerged within the Party. In this situation, all Party members must remain sober-minded and "fight against all forces that attempt to strike the Party and force it to the sidelines."

    波统一工人党十五中全会举行续会
    拉科夫斯基强调捍卫社会主义理想
    新华社华沙10月4日电　据波通社报道，波兰统一工人党10届15中全会续会3日在华沙举行。会议通过了关于召开党的第11次代表大会的决议和《关于11大前党在主要任务问题上的立场》。
    这次续会是9月18日开始的15中全会的第二阶段。党中央政治局委员、中央书记米莱尔在会上作了关于党内最近的民意调查结果和建议的报告。他在报告中说，调查结果表明，多数党员赞成11大代表通过党员直接选举产生。全会决定，于1990年1月27日召开党的11大。在此之前，将在全党就波兰社会主义的未来形式、党的模式和纲领目标进行讨论。
    全会通过的《关于11大前党在主要任务问题上的立场》指出，要“从根本上改变波兰统一工人党”，使它成为“民主的、社会主义的左派党”，“有能力抵御右派势力和派别压力的党”。这一文件强调，在当前形势下要捍卫党的政治团结。
    文件说，统一工人党支持改造所有制关系，以使生产效益、合理分配和工人参与管理良好地结合在一起；赞成所有制形式的多样化，但“反对将所有的社会财产或其基本部分出售”给私人。波兰新政府决定在波兰实行“自由市场经济”，并为克服经济困难将采取一些紧缩性措施。在这个问题上，波党主张一切措施都不能损害劳动人民的利益。
    波党在这一文件中表示赞赏由团结工会领导的新政府所发表的仅仅依据专业知识和忠于国家的标准任免干部的声明，同时“对在实践中破坏这一原则的事例表示不安”。文件说，“我们将坚决反对一切非实质性的人事清算”。
    全会闭幕前，波党中央第一书记拉科夫斯基致闭幕词。他号召统一工人党党员继续忠于和捍卫社会主义理想，“反对一切企图把波兰推离社会主义发展道路的主张”。
    拉科夫斯基说，统一工人党在今年6月波议会大选中失利后，反共分子、统一工人党的政治敌人叫嚣要统一工人党退出政治舞台，在党内也出现了一些糊涂思想和观点。在这种形势下，全体党员要保持清醒头脑，要“同一切妄图打击党和迫使党靠边站的势力进行斗争。”
