A new scenic area, Jiuxiang Stone Gorge Karst Cave, has been opened in Yunnan, just 20 kilometers away from the famous Stone Forest. It is located in the Yiliang and Hui ethnic minority township of Yiliang County. Within the 30-square-kilometer scenic area, there is the largest cave group in Yunnan, featuring typical karst landforms. The air inside the vast caves is fresh, with strange rocks and unique scenery. Inside the cave, there is a 30-meter-high waterfall, a rare sight in China. Outside the cave is the gorge, with clear water flowing at the bottom all year round, suitable for boating.

Since the Jiuxiang Scenic Area opened a month ago, it has attracted tens of thousands of tourists. The area is 120 kilometers away from Kunming, and a dedicated bus line has been opened.
