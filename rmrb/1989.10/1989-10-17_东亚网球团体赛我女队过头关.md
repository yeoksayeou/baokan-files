Reporter Miú Lǔ reports from Beijing, October 16th: Today, another newly completed venue for the Asian Games officially opened. Inside the Beijing International Tennis Center, athletes participating in the Asian Tennis Championships and the East Asian Tennis Team Competition began their nine-day competition.

In the first round of the women's team competition held today, the sisters from both sides of the Taiwan Strait fought a hard battle over three matches before the winner was determined. Eighteen-year-old Tang Min was the first to take the court, facing China Taipei's second-ranked player Lai Suling. She won in straight sets in just one hour, securing the first point for China Team One. However, in the second match, Chen Li of China lost to Wang Enting of China Taipei. In the third doubles match, although the score was 2-0, the competition was more intense. Tang Min and Li Fang paired up, winning the first set 6-4. In the second set, they fought to a 6-6 tie with Wang Enting and Lai Suling, and only won the final game in a tiebreaker, ultimately helping China Team One advance to the semifinals. The Hong Kong women's team defeated China Team Two 2-1, also securing a spot in the semifinals.

    东亚网球团体赛我女队过头关
    本报北京10月16日讯　记者缪鲁报道：今天，又一座新落成的北京亚运会赛场正式启用。在北京国际网球中心里，来此参加亚洲网球锦标赛暨东亚网球团体赛的各方好手开始了为期9天的角逐。
    在今天进行的东亚团体赛女子第一轮角逐中，海峡两岸小姐妹打满三场才分定胜负。年方18岁的唐敏首先出阵，迎战中国台北队第二号人物赖素玲，仅用一个小时便连胜两盘，为中国一队拿下头一分。但第二场中国队陈莉负于中国台北的王恩婷。第三场双打虽然比分也是2∶0，但角逐更为激烈，唐敏与李芳配对，先以6比4拿下第一盘，第二盘却与王恩婷和赖素玲战成6∶6平，经加赛才赢下最后一局，终使中国一队闯过头关，进入半决赛。香港女队以2∶1胜中国二队，也获得半决赛权。
