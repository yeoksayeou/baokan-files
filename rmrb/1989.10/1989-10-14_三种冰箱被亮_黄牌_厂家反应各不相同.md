Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Yan Ping and Xiao Di report from Dalian on October 13th:

Dalian City Consumers' Association recently issued a "yellow card" to three brands of refrigerators—Kanai, Bolai, and Jiamelai—after which the three manufacturers responded differently: "Kanai" reflected on itself and made immediate changes; "Bolai" also took some actions; while "Jiamelai" remained indifferent.

Facing consumer criticism, the general manager of Tianjin Refrigerator Industry Company, Lü Xin, said, "Only by constantly identifying our own shortcomings will 'Kanai' have a future." Among the non-conforming products identified by the Dalian City Consumers' Association, a significant portion was due to rough handling and double-stacking during transportation, which are not inherent quality issues of the products. Despite this, they did not merely emphasize external factors to shift blame but instead identified deficiencies in their management, domestically sourced components, and production experience. At the same time, they decided to implement point-of-sale sales, improve packaging design, and enhance protective measures to reduce damage to products from rough handling during transportation. Concurrently, the company dispatched a maintenance and service team led by the chief engineer to Dalian, starting in mid-September to conduct a quality service month. During the service, they aimed to ensure that "not a single non-conforming refrigerator remains in Dalian," taking the initiative to perform maintenance.

According to the Dalian City Consumers' Association, in late September, the manufacturer of "Bolai," the state-owned Nanjing Xinyuan Machinery Factory, sent representatives to listen to the consumers' association's feedback. They immediately air-freighted a batch of spare parts and planned to launch a quality service campaign in mid-October. Currently, the severely problematic refrigerators have been replaced with new parts, but the supply of spare parts has not been fundamentally resolved.

In contrast to the above two manufacturers, the producer of "Jiamelai," the Hubei Shashi Refrigerator Factory, has remained unmoved. Originally, the certificates and manuals for the Jiamelai brand refrigerators produced by its Xinanjiang branch and the main factory were identical. However, the factory attributed all responsibility to its branch in a letter, without proposing any concrete improvement measures.

    三种冰箱被亮“黄牌”  厂家反应各不相同
    本报大连10月13日电　新华社记者阎平、本报记者肖荻报道：大连市消费者协会前不久向可耐、伯乐和家美乐三种牌号的电冰箱亮出“黄牌”后，三个厂家反应各异：“可耐”反躬自省、闻过即改；“伯乐”也有所行动；而“家美乐”却无动于衷。
    面对消费者的批评，天津电冰箱工业公司总经理吕新说：“只有多从自身找差距，‘可耐’才有出路。”被大连市消费者协会检查出的不合格产品中，有很大一部分是由于运输环节的野蛮装卸、双层码放等因素造成的，并不属于产品内在质量问题。尽管如此，他们没有单纯强调客观原因而一推了事，而是一方面查找自己在管理、国产化配套及生产经验等方面的不足；另一方面决定实行定点销售、改进包装设计和防护手段，以减少中间环节及野蛮装卸给产品带来的危害。与此同时，这个公司派出以总工程师为首的维修服务队伍赶赴大连，从9月中旬起开展优质服务月活动。在服务中他们以“不让一台不合格冰箱留在大连”为目标，主动维修。
    另据大连市消费者协会反映，9月下旬，“伯乐”生产厂——国营（南京）新联机械厂派人听取了消费者协会的意见后，立即空运来一批零配件，并打算在本月中旬开展优质服务活动。目前，问题严重的冰箱已经换上了新配件，但零配件的供应尚未得到根本解决。
    与上述两厂家相比，“家美乐”的生产厂——湖北沙市电冰箱厂至今仍无动于衷。本来，它与其新安江分厂生产的家美乐牌电冰箱的合格证和说明书完全相同，但厂方在来函中却把责任全部推给其分厂，没有拿出任何切实可行的改进措施。
