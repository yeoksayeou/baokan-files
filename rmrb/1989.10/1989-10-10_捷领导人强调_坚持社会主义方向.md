    Czechoslovak leader emphasizes adherence to socialist direction

    New China News Agency, Prague, October 7 - Member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee Presidium and Deputy Prime Minister of the Federal Government, Petr Pithart, said that it should be pointed out to those Westerners who predict the demise of socialism that socialism is an indispensable part of the contemporary world.

    Pithart made these remarks at a meeting held on October 7 to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak People's Army.

    Pithart said in his speech that socialism "embodies the aspirations of the working people for social justice and dignity. It should be able to overcome the current difficulties, rid itself of outdated dogmas, achieve a revival, tap its potential, and fulfill its historical mission."

    When discussing reform and democracy, Pithart said that reform can only be carried out smoothly in an atmosphere of criticism, democracy, and openness. However, we firmly oppose attempts to belittle the achievements of socialist construction, to bring instability into society, to split the national front, and to doubt the leadership role of the Communist Party.

    捷领导人强调
    坚持社会主义方向
    新华社布拉格10月7日电  捷共中央主席团委员、联邦政府副总理皮特拉说，应向西方那些断言社会主义将灭亡的预言家们指出，社会主义是当今世界不可缺少的一部分。
    皮特拉是在7日庆祝捷克斯洛伐克人民军建军45周年大会上讲这番话的。
    皮特拉在讲话中说，社会主义“体现着劳动人民对社会公平和尊严的渴望，它应能克服当前的种种困难，摆脱过时的教条，实现复兴，发挥自身的潜力，完成历史使命”。
    皮特拉在谈到改革与民主问题时说，只有在批评、民主和公开性的气氛中才能顺利进行改革。但是我们坚决反对贬低社会主义建设成果、想把不稳定的状况带入社会之中、分裂民族阵线以及怀疑共产党的领导作用的图谋。
