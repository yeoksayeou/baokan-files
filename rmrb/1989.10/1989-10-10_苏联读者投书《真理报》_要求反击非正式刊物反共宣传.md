	Soviet readers have written to *Pravda*, demanding a counterattack against the anti-communist propaganda spread by unofficial publications. They hope that the Party will take the initiative in the ideological struggle and resolutely fight against the political enemies of the Soviet system.

	Romashov, a 92-year-old veteran Party member from Leningrad, pointed out that reform is a continuation of the October Revolution. Yet, some people are attacking it in vulgar pamphlets, attempting to turn back the wheel of history.

	Starovoytov, who joined the Party in 1931, stated in his letter, "Freedom of speech and democracy are not a joke; the state must have some order." He added, "I do not oppose criticism, but criticism and dialogue are one thing, while defaming communist ideals and calling for the overthrow of our system is another."

	Many readers are deeply concerned about the phenomenon of certain unofficial publications defaming socialism and attacking the Party and its leaders. Some have called for harsh measures against the publishers of these publications, even suggesting criminal prosecution.

    苏联读者投书《真理报》
    要求反击非正式刊物反共宣传
    据新华社莫斯科10月6日电　苏联《真理报》6日刊登读者来信，要求反击社会上“非正式”刊物的反共宣传，希望党在意识形态战线上积极展开攻势，同苏维埃制度在政治上的敌人作坚决斗争。
    列宁格勒92岁的老党员罗马绍夫指出，改革是十月革命的继续。而有人却在下流小报上攻击它，妄图让历史车轮倒转。
    1931年入党的斯塔罗沃伊托夫在信中说，“言论自由和民主并非儿戏，国家必须有某种秩序。”“我不反对批评，但批评和对话是一回事，而污蔑共产主义理想和呼吁推翻我国制度则是另一回事。”
    不少读者对某些“非正式”刊物丑化社会主义，攻击党及其领导人的现象深感不安。有人要求对这些刊物的出版者采取强硬措施，甚至追究“刑事责任”。
