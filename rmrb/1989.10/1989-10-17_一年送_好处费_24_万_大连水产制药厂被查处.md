    A factory in Dalian paid out 2.4 million yuan in bribes annually to boost sales, and used fake invoices to reduce reported income, resulting in significant tax evasion. The Dalian Water Products Pharmaceutical Factory was recently investigated and penalized by the Dalian Tax Bureau.

    Since 1988, the pharmaceutical products produced by this factory have faced market resistance, leading to a significant decline in sales. In an attempt to expand their market, the factory resorted to illegal means: paying large sums of money as "goodwill fees" to purchasing units and individuals. Out of 175 examined transactions, the amounts paid ranged from a few hundred yuan to over a thousand yuan, with a significant portion ending up in personal pockets. To avoid detection, the factory hid the receipts in the sales department and issued fake invoices to reduce their reported income. In 1988 alone, the factory spent 243,000 yuan on bribes, evading nearly 700,000 yuan in various taxes.

    一年送“好处费”24万
    大连水产制药厂被查处
    据新华社大连10月16日电　（通讯员松芳、大连日报记者洛长来）大连市水产制药厂在产品滞销的情况下，靠“好处费”开道，一年送掉24万元，并用“红字”发票冲减销售收入，造成严重偷漏税行为，最近被大连市税务一分局查处。
    1988年以来，这个制药厂生产的药品在市场上销售受阻，销量明显下降。为了扩大产品销路，这个厂竟然生出“斜门歪道”：大量付给买货单位和个人“好处费”。在清查的175笔帐目中，付给双方“好处费”少者几百元，多则上千元，大量“好处费”流入个人腰包。这个厂为了逃避检查，将白条子私藏在销售科内，开具“红字”发票，以冲减其产品收入。仅1988年一年，这个厂支出“好处费”就达24.3万多元，共偷漏各种税款近7万元。
