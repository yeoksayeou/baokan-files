The Beijing Railway Bureau has been vigorously tapping into its potential under conditions of overloaded transport capacity and has been deeply engaged in the "double increase and double conservation" campaign. This year, while achieving record-highs in 18 indicators including freight volume, passenger volume, and transport revenue, the bureau has saved energy and materials equivalent to 120 million yuan.

The Beijing Railway Bureau plays a crucial role in railway transportation, accounting for one-quarter of the national freight volume, one-seventh of the passenger volume, and one-third of the coal transport volume. Nationally significant enterprises such as the seven major power grids, eight major steel plants, and three major aluminum plants all rely on coal transported by the Beijing Bureau for their operations. Statistics show that for every 1,000 million tons of coal transported, 17 billion yuan in industrial output value can be created. The leadership of the Beijing Railway Bureau has a clear understanding of the responsibilities they bear. When planning this year's "double increase and double conservation" campaign, they first established the principle of "ensuring social benefits while maintaining corporate profits," urging all employees of the bureau to enhance their sense of honor and responsibility as "Beijing Railway People." Based on this, the bureau established "double increase and double conservation" organizations at all levels, forming a three-tier management network at the bureau, division, and station levels. They also mobilized the entire bureau to contribute ideas and strategies, formulating a total of 47 measures, thereby transforming the leadership's resolve into the voluntary actions of the broad masses of employees.

To alleviate the contradiction between transport volume and capacity, and to increase transport and revenue, the bureau decisively reformed the transport organization, adjusted the timetable, increased train density and speed, and ensured full-load transportation, thereby increasing transport efficiency by 1.44 million car-hours. This year, the national transport plan for the bureau increased by 1,050 million tons compared to last year. In April, there was still a shortage of coal for power generation nationwide, and the State Council temporarily added 238 million tons of coal transport volume for the bureau. Faced with this situation, the bureau was willing to reduce transport revenue to ensure the coal supply for key enterprises. They further tapped into their potential, strengthened the coal transport mechanism, and reasonably arranged the transport of general goods, freeing up some empty cars to prioritize coal transport. In this way, the entire bureau transported an additional 970 million tons of coal, solving the urgent need for coal in power plants.

While increasing production and revenue, the bureau has also explored every possible means to reduce energy and material consumption, strengthened self-discipline mechanisms, and implemented cost control. According to statistics, since this year, the entire bureau has saved 180,000 tons of coal, 839 cubic meters of water, 270 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 90,000 tons of oil, totaling savings of 91.19 million yuan. The entire bureau has also saved nearly 30 million yuan in the projects of repairing old equipment and conserving and substituting materials.

    社会效益必保　企业效益不丢
    京铁局深入开展双增双节
    货运客运和收入全面增长　能源物资消耗大幅下降
    本报讯　北京铁路局在运能超饱和的情况下大力挖潜，深入开展“双增双节”活动。今年以来，在货运量、客运量、运输收入等18项指标均创全路最高纪录的同时，节约能源和物资折合人民币1.2亿元。
    北京铁路局在铁路运输中占有重要地位，货运量占全路1／4，客运量占全路1／7，煤炭运量占全路1／3。全国七大电网、八大钢厂、三大铝厂等78家国家重点企业都依赖北京局运送的煤炭作动力。据统计，每运送1000万吨煤，可创造工业产值170亿元。北京铁路局领导对自己肩负的责任有清醒的认识，在部署今年“双增双节”活动时，首先确立“社会效益必保，企业效益不丢”的思想，要求全局职工切实增强做“京铁人”的光荣感和责任感。在此基础上，这个局成立了各级“双增双节”机构，形成局、分局、站段三级管理网络，并动员全局上下献计献策，共制订出47条措施，从而使领导的决心变成广大职工的自觉行动。
    为了缓解运量与运能的矛盾，增运增收，这个局果断改革运输组织，调整运行图，提高列车密度和速度，做到满轴满载，从而使运输效率增加144万车小时。今年国家给这个局的运输计划比去年增加1050万吨，4月份全国发电用煤仍有缺口，国务院又临时给局里增加238万吨煤炭运量。面对这种情况，这个局宁愿减少运输收入，也要确保重点企业用煤。他们进一步挖潜，强化运煤机制，合理安排一般货物运输，挤出一部分空敞车优先安排运煤。这样全局共多运煤炭970多万吨，解了电厂燃眉之急。
    在增产增收的同时，这个局又千方百计降低能源和原材料消耗，强化自我约束机制，实行成本包干使用。据统计，今年以来，全局已节约煤炭18万多吨、水839立方米、电2.7亿千瓦小时、油9万吨，共计节约合人民币9119万元。全局还在修旧利废和节约代用等项目中共节省资金近3000万元。
