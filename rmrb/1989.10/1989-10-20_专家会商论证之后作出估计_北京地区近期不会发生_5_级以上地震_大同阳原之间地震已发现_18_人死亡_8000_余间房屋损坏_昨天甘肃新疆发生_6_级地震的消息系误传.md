    After experts discussed and analyzed, it is estimated that Beijing will not experience a 5+ magnitude earthquake in the near future. The earthquake between Datong and Yangyuan has resulted in 18 deaths and damage to more than 8,000 houses. The news of a 6.0 magnitude earthquake in Gansu and Xinjiang yesterday was a misreport.

    According to the Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 19th, 17:00 (reporter Zhuo Peirong) Director of the State Seismological Bureau, Fang Zongshun, made a statement this afternoon, pointing out that the earthquake that occurred late on the night of October 18th to the early morning of October 19th in the border area of Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia was the strongest earthquake in the North China region since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake. However, it is estimated that Beijing will not experience a 5+ magnitude earthquake in the near future.

    Fang Zongshun made these estimates and judgments after experts discussed and analyzed the available seismic data.

    Since 22:57 on October 18th, this region has experienced five earthquakes of 5+ magnitude, with the strongest being a 6.1 magnitude. The area affected by the earthquake has a diameter of four to five hundred kilometers. Since this earthquake is of the swarm type, the duration of strong seismic activity is longer than that of general main-aftershock type earthquakes, and relevant departments in the seismic area should strengthen their vigilance.

    Seismic research shows that China has entered a new period of seismic activity in recent years.

    Fang Zongshun said that this earthquake has no internal connection with the strong earthquake that occurred in San Francisco, USA, on October 18th. At the same time, he mentioned that there was a report saying that a 6.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Gansu and Xinjiang early this morning, which was a misreport, and there was no earthquake in Gansu and Xinjiang in China at that time.

    It is understood that the transportation and telecommunications in the seismic area have not been interrupted. Anti-seismic and disaster relief work is being actively carried out under the leadership of the local government.

    According to the Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 19th, 15:00 (reporter Zhuo Peirong) According to the information collected by the State Seismological Bureau by noon today, 18 people have died, 28 have been injured, and more than 8,000 houses have been damaged in the earthquake that occurred between Datong County, Shanxi Province, and Yangyuan County, Hebei Province, last night to this morning. Among them, Yanggao County in Shanxi Province suffered heavy losses, with 11 deaths reported.

    Seismic experts have analyzed the available data and believe that there is still a possibility of a 5 to 6 magnitude earthquake in this seismic area in the next few days. However, it is generally estimated that the possibility of a larger earthquake is not high.

    According to experts, this earthquake was already predicted in the mid-term at the beginning of this year. The national conference at that time had already determined that the Datong and Yangyuan areas were one of the key monitoring areas for earthquakes in the country this year.

    Last night to this morning, more than 50 experts from the State Seismological Bureau and the seismic monitoring departments of Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia have already rushed to the seismic site with their instruments. The State Seismological Bureau has further strengthened the discussion and judgment work on this earthquake.

    专家会商论证之后作出估计
    北京地区近期不会发生5级以上地震
    大同阳原之间地震已发现18人死亡8000余间房屋损坏
    昨天甘肃新疆发生6级地震的消息系误传
    据新华社北京10月19日17时电（记者卓培荣）国家地震局局长方樟顺今天下午发表谈话，指出10月18日深夜至19日凌晨在河北、山西和内蒙古交界地区发生的地震，是1976年唐山大地震以后，华北地区发生的一次最强烈的地震。但是估计北京地区近期不会发生5级以上地震。
    方樟顺是在专家们根据已有的地震资料进行会商论证之后，作出这些估计和判断的。
    18日22时57分以来，这一地区已发生5级以上地震5次，其中最强的6.1级。有感地区范围直径达四五百公里。由于这次地震属于震群型，强震活动的持续时间比一般的主—余震型地震活动的持续时间要长，震区有关部门还应加强防范。
    地震科学研究表明，我国近年来又进入新的地震活跃时期。
    方樟顺说，此次地震同10月18日美国旧金山发生的强震没有内在联系。同时他谈到，曾有报道说，今天凌晨甘肃、新疆发生6级地震，此事属于误传，当时我国甘肃、新疆并未发生地震。
    据了解，震区的交通和电信没有中断。抗震救灾工作已在当地政府领导下积极展开。
    据新华社北京10月19日15时电　（记者卓培荣）据今天中午以前国家地震局收集到的情况，昨天夜里至今天早晨山西省大同县与河北省阳原县之间发生的地震中，已发现18人死亡，28人受伤，8000余间房屋损坏。其中山西省阳高县损失较重，已发现有11人死亡。
    地震专家根据已有资料分析，近几天还应注意这一震区发生5级至6级较强地震的可能。但是一般估计发生更大地震的可能性不大。
    据专家介绍，此次地震今年年初已经作出中期预报。当时的全国会商会就曾确定，大同、阳原地区为今年全国地震重点监视区之一。
    昨天夜里至今天上午，国家地震局和河北、山西、内蒙古地震监测部门的50多位专家已经携带仪器先后赶往地震现场。国家地震局已进一步加强了对此次地震的会商判断工作。
