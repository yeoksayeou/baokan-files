The General Offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council have issued regulations on strictly controlling overseas visits by leading cadres.

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 7th - The General Offices of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council have issued regulations on strictly controlling overseas visits by leading cadres of party and state organs at the provincial and ministerial levels (including deputy provincial and ministerial levels) and above. The regulations are as follows:

1. Overseas visits by leading cadres must be for the execution of official duties or work-related visits. They must not, under any circumstances, engage in visits unrelated to their official duties or that are not commensurate with their rank, nor accept invitations from foreign businesses or overseas Chinese-funded enterprises to visit, nor instruct foreign parties to invite them to visit.

   Retired cadres will no longer be dispatched on official duties overseas.

2. Overseas visits by leading cadres must be approved through the proper organizational procedures. The reviewing authorities must strictly control the process. Any visits not approved through the proper procedures will not be processed by the relevant departments. No one may submit personal requests for overseas visits to party and state leaders, and party and state leaders will not accept any personal requests for overseas visits.

3. Overseas visits by party and state leaders will be proposed and reported by the relevant functional departments based on work needs and approved by the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee.

4. Overseas visits by leading cadres, except for special work needs, should not exceed once a year. The duration of the visit should be as short as possible, generally limited to three to five days for one country (region), and no detours or extended stays abroad for any reason.

5. Strictly control the size of visiting delegations. For party and state leaders, the total number of accompanying and attending personnel should not exceed 20, and the number of accompanying journalists should also be reduced. For other central leaders, the total number of accompanying and attending personnel should not exceed 10. For provincial and ministerial-level cadres, the total number of delegation members should not exceed 5. In special cases where the number of personnel needs to exceed the regulations, a special approval must be obtained. The size of delegations attending multilateral, bilateral international conferences, or other professional conferences will be approved based on actual needs.

6. If leading cadres need to bring their spouses on overseas visits for work reasons, this must be stated in the report and approved together. Children may not be brought on overseas visits for any reason.

7. Leading cadres must strictly follow relevant regulations when giving gifts to foreigners; gifts received from foreigners must be registered and handed over to the relevant departments, and may not be disposed of privately.

8. When leading cadres lead delegations on overseas visits, Chinese embassies, consulates, and other overseas institutions and companies must not host or indirectly host banquets, nor give gifts or souvenirs.

The above regulations must be strictly enforced. Those who violate them will be severely punished, and serious cases will be subject to disciplinary action. The disciplinary inspection, supervision, and financial departments must strengthen inspections and supervision.

These regulations apply to cadres at equivalent levels in national mass organizations and public institutions.

The regulations for overseas visits by military leading cadres will be issued by the Central Military Commission in accordance with these principles.
