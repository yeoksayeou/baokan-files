The People's Daily reports: Zhangjiakou City in Hebei Province has taken the task of cleaning up and rectifying commercial wholesale enterprises as a key initiative. By the end of September, 589 problematic wholesale enterprises have been eliminated. This move aims to address the issue of multiple layers of wholesale operations and to help stabilize prices and maintain market order.

In recent years, with the rise of the "company fever," Zhangjiakou City has seen the number of wholesale enterprises swell to over 840. The ratio of wholesale to retail is 1:4.5. This irrational structure, with too many wholesale layers and price increases at each level, has been a significant factor in the disorder of the circulation sector. Some small shops, with only about 10 square meters of space, a few employees, and a few hundred yuan in capital, without any warehousing facilities, have also engaged in wholesale activities. Many wholesale enterprises simply change hands without moving goods, adding layers of markup and indirectly raising prices, benefiting from the chaos, which has drawn considerable public criticism.

Starting in late April, the municipal Party committee and government made specific arrangements. Relevant departments conducted a comprehensive audit of the operating conditions, methods, and scopes of wholesale enterprises. Based on this, they strictly controlled the approval and renewal of business licenses. All commercial wholesale enterprises were required to re-register and re-apply for licenses.

　　减少流通环节　理顺流通渠道
　　张家口向批发企业砍一刀
    本报讯　河北省张家口市把清理整顿商业批发企业作为一项重要工作来抓。截至9月底，已经砍掉有问题的批发企业589家，为解决多层次批发的局面，为平抑物价、维护市场秩序提供了有利条件。
    近几年，随着“公司热”的兴起，张家口市的批发企业多达840多户，批发与零售比例为1∶4.5。批零结构不合理，批发环节多，层层加价，成为造成流通领域秩序混乱的原因之一。一些只有10多平方米的小店，几名从业人员，数百元资金，无仓储设施，根本就不具备批发条件，也干起了批发行当。有不少批发企业大多是货物未动，已几易其主，层层加码，变相涨价，从中渔利，群众意见很大。
    从4月下旬起，市委、市政府专门作了部署，有关部门逐一对批发企业的经营条件、经营方式、经营范围进行全面清查审核，在此基础上，把好审批换照关。所有商业批发企业一律重新登记注册。　　（王克强　郭彦）
