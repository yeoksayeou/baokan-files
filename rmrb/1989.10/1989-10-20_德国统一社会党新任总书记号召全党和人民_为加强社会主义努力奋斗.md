The new General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Egon Krenz, delivered a televised address to the nation yesterday evening, calling on the entire party and the people of the nation to unite and strive for the strengthening of socialism.

Krenz first expressed his gratitude to the Central Committee for their trust and thanked Erich Honecker for his long-term leadership of the party. He emphasized that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany will unhesitatingly continue along the path laid out by the recent statement of the Political Bureau. He stressed the need for courage, facing reality, and steadfastness. Through this Central Committee plenary session, the party aims to present a new image to the people.

He pointed out that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is a Marxist-Leninist party, a great and tested fighting organization. He stressed that without the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, there would be no German Democratic Republic. The most important thing is the unity and firm actions of the party, mutual trust, and consistency between words and deeds.

General Secretary Krenz emphasized the need to fully utilize the role of the working class, calling on the working class, as the leading class, and the party to work together to solve problems arising from the complex economic and political situation. He also pointed out that socialist society requires the joint efforts of all strata of the people, including cooperative farmers, intellectuals, craftsmen, soldiers, women, youth, and religious citizens, including clergy.

Krenz stressed that the party's economic policy and social welfare policy are unified and effective, and must be continued. There is no reason to underestimate or doubt the achievements already made. He also discussed the urgent problems and shortcomings in the construction of the Democratic Republic, believing that these should not be underestimated. He said that the party's program is to further develop and continuously innovate socialism.

Krenz said that, according to the idea of combining continuity with innovation, the Political Bureau's statement has opened the door for dialogue on domestic policy. He hopes that through open debate, the best solutions can be found for the continued development of socialism in the Democratic Republic.

He proposed two prerequisites for dialogue: first, everything for the continued development of socialism in the Democratic Republic, respecting the socialist ideal, and not betraying the achievements of the people of the Democratic Republic; second, the Democratic Republic is a sovereign state and should solve its own problems. What the Democratic Republic should do and should not do, and what kind of reforms it should carry out, should be decided by the Democratic Republic itself.

Krenz announced that the Political Bureau of the Central Committee has proposed to the government to draft a legal draft on the travel of citizens of the Democratic Republic abroad, to be discussed publicly and then reviewed by the People's Assembly. He pointed out that a serious obstacle to the travel of citizens of the Democratic Republic to the West is that West Germany still refuses to respect the citizenship of citizens of the Democratic Republic, stubbornly insisting on the revanchist position of "protecting all Germans."

In terms of foreign policy, Krenz expressed that the alliance with the Soviet Union will continue to be prioritized, and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries will be strengthened. At the same time, according to the policy of peaceful coexistence, cooperation with all countries will be strengthened.

When discussing the preparations for the 12th Congress, the new General Secretary said that this work will be carried out through exchanges of views between the party and the people. According to Leninist thought, democratic centralism will be widely and openly implemented within the party, respecting opinions from below, conducting criticism and self-criticism, and making decisions after full discussion and exchange of views.

Krenz finally said, "Our power is the power of the working class under the leadership of the party, the power of all the people. All our efforts are not for our own interests, but for the happiness of the people. We will exercise this power better for the strengthening of socialism, for the maintenance of peace, for the beautiful reality and future of the people. 'Everything is in our hands, everything depends on our unity, the unity and firmness of our party.'"

    德国统一社会党新任总书记号召全党和人民
    为加强社会主义努力奋斗
    本报柏林10月19日电　记者许宏治报道：新任德国统一社会党中央总书记埃贡·克伦茨昨晚向全国公民发表电视讲话，号召全党和全国人民同心同德，为加强社会主义而努力奋斗。
    克伦茨首先感谢中央委员会对他的信任，并对埃里希·昂纳克同志多年来在党的领导岗位上所做的工作表示感谢。
    克伦茨指出，德国统一社会党将毫不犹豫地沿着不久前中央政治局声明所开创的道路前进。他强调，在这方面要有勇气，要正视现实，要坚定不移。通过这次中央全会，党要在人民面前树立崭新的形象。
    他指出，德国统一社会党是马克思列宁主义的政党，是一个伟大的、久经考验的战斗组织。他强调，没有德国统一社会党，就没有德意志民主共和国。最重要的是，党的统一和坚定的行动，相互信任和言行一致。
    克伦茨总书记强调要充分发挥工人阶级的作用，号召作为领导阶级的工人阶级和党共同努力，来解决在复杂的经济、政治形势下出现的问题。他还指出，社会主义社会需要合作社农民、知识分子、手工业者、士兵、妇女、青年等各阶层人民群众的共同努力，包括教会人士和信仰宗教的公民在内。
    克伦茨强调指出，党的经济政策和社会福利政策相统一的战略方针是行之有效的，必须继续坚持。没有任何理由低估或者怀疑已经取得的成就。他同时谈到了民主德国建设中急待解决的问题和工作中的缺点，认为不能对此估计不足。他说，党的纲领是使社会主义进一步发展并不断革新。
    克伦茨说，根据连续性与革新相结合的思想，政治局声明为就国内政策进行对话打开了大门。他希望，通过公开辩论，为继续发展民德的社会主义找到最好的解决办法。
    他提出了对话的两个前提：一、一切为了社会主义在民德的继续发展，尊重社会主义理想，不能背弃民德人民共同取得的成就；二、民主德国是主权国家，应该自己解决自己的问题。民德应该做什么和不应该做什么，将进行什么样的改革，应由民德自己决定。
    克伦茨宣布，党中央政治局已向政府提出建议，起草有关民德公民出国旅行的法律草案，公开征求意见后由人民议院审议。他指出，现在对民德公民到西方旅行的一个严重障碍是，西德仍然拒绝尊重民德公民的国籍，顽固坚持“对所有德国人实行保护责任”的复仇主义立场。
    在对外政策方面，克伦茨表示将继续把同苏联结盟放在首位，继续同苏联及其他社会主义国家加强合作，同时根据和平共处的政策，继续同所有国家加强合作。
    在谈到为12大作准备时，新任总书记表示，这一工作将通过党和全体人民交换意见来进行。将按照列宁主义思想，广泛公开地在党内实行民主集中制，要尊重来自下面的意见，开展批评和自我批评，在充分讨论和交换意见后再作出决议。
    克伦茨最后说，我们的权力是在党的领导下工人阶级的权力，全体人民的权力。我们的一切努力都不是为了自己的私利，而是为了人民的幸福。我们将为了加强社会主义，为了维护和平，为了人民美好的现实和未来，更好地行使这一权力。“一切都在我们手中，一切在于我们的团结一致，我们党的统一和坚定”。
