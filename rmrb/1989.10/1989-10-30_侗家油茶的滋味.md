I love drinking tea, but the one that I cannot forget is the oil tea made by the Dong people. The taste of it, I am constantly savoring.

In the early winter of 1971, I was participating in the construction of the Zhuli Railway at the Liu Meng site in Sanjiang County, Guangxi. Liu Meng was a poor and remote mountain village, surrounded by mountains on three sides and facing the Rong River on one side, which was also the only passage connecting the village to the outside world.

Near our team's camp, there was a solitary stilt house. The wooden walls of the house had turned black from age, and the roof had rotted from long-term exposure to wind and rain. The owner of the house, Uncle Wei, was in his forties, always wearing a homemade cloth shirt. His dark yellow face showed a faint trace of worry. Uncle Wei's family cultivated a lot of shiitake mushrooms. Sometimes, the workers from our team would exchange noodles with him for some to cook. Once, I asked him why he didn't sell some of the shiitake mushrooms for money. He sighed and said, "To sell shiitake mushrooms, one has to go to the county town of Guyi. It takes a whole day to row a small boat there and back, plus an overnight stay, and the money from selling the mushrooms isn't enough to cover the expenses for food and lodging." It turned out that the local people mainly grew shiitake mushrooms for their own use.

The Dong people are hospitable, especially to outsiders. That night, Aunt Wei, Uncle Wei's wife, invited us a few workers to her home to make oil tea. Aunt Wei first put dried rice (sun-dried cooked rice) into the pot to roast, explaining as she roasted, "Dried rice is best made from glutinous rice, but the mountains have little land, and the grain grown is not enough to eat, so where would we get glutinous rice to make oil tea?" After the rice puffs were roasted, Aunt Wei took a handful of old tea leaves from a tea brick and boiled them into tea water. Then she put the rice puffs into bowls and poured the tea water over them, serving each of us a bowl. I had often heard that Dong oil tea was famous, but now that I tasted it, it was bitter and astringent, the tea water swirling in my throat and refusing to go down. I stole a glance at Aunt Wei, and she was looking at us with a mixture of anxiety and expectation. It was clear that if we did not drink it, she would feel very sad. I steeled myself and drank the oil tea in one gulp, insincerely saying, "Delicious! Delicious!" That night, I left Uncle Wei's home with a heart full of pity for the Dong people.

This spring, before the Chinese New Year, I went to the Liu Meng railway station to manage the spring transportation. Unexpectedly, I had the opportunity to drink Dong oil tea again. After ten years, Liu Meng had changed beyond recognition. After the Zhuli Railway was put into operation, this small mountain village had completely transformed. The old stilt houses were gone, replaced by rows of red brick houses. In the station's freight yard, there were piles of timber and silica stone waiting to be shipped. At the south end of the station, a piece of open ground had spontaneously become a small market, with basic necessities like pork, vegetables, cigarettes, sugar, and daily goods. There were even more packages of shiitake mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, and dried bamboo shoots, all piled on the ground. Merchants from Liuzhou, Rong'an, and other places haggled with the local sellers over prices. The small mountain village was bustling with activity.

The host who invited me to drink oil tea was the brother of Liu Meng station's Liang master. Liang's family also grew shiitake mushrooms. Liang was in his thirties, full of energy, with a radiant face. He wore a light gray suit, a white shirt, and a red flower-patterned tie, making him look like a company manager. Liang told me that thanks to the railway, transportation had become much more convenient, and the market for shiitake mushrooms had expanded, with prices also rising. Liang's family's oil tea had many varieties, using authentic Sanjiang large glutinous rice and seasonings like pork liver, blood sausage, and crushed peanuts. After the oil tea was made, Liang generously invited me, "When you come to Sanjiang, not drinking oil tea means you are not a guest of the Dong people. Have a bowl!" I remembered the taste of the first time I drank oil tea and felt a bit hesitant, but I couldn't refuse his hospitality. I carefully took a sip, and immediately felt a comfortable flow of air from my throat to my heart. The oil tea was sweet with a hint of bitterness, and the aroma was hidden within. I ate some pork liver, blood sausage, and glutinous rice puffs, finding them crisp and fragrant. Following the Dong people's custom, I drank three bowls in a row and truly didn't want to put down the bowl. I thought of Uncle Wei's family, and their lives must have improved as well, because they also grew a lot of shiitake mushrooms. If I went to his home to drink oil tea again, it might be even sweeter and more fragrant than Liang's.

### 侗家油茶的滋味

　　侗家油茶的滋味
　　韩复云
    我爱喝茶，但令我不能忘怀的只有侗家人打的油茶，其中的滋味，我无时无刻不在回味着。
    1971年初冬，我在广西三江县六孟工地参加修建枝柳铁路大会战。六孟是一个穷僻的山村，三面靠山，一面临融江，这也是六孟村唯一与外界联系的通道。
    靠近我们连队附近，有一幢孤单的吊脚楼，楼房四壁的木板已经旧得发黑，楼顶的木皮因长期受风雨的侵蚀，表层已经霉烂。楼房主人韦叔，40多岁，整天穿着一件自织的土布衣服，黑黄的脸上隐现出一丝淡淡的愁容。韦叔家里培植了很多香菇，有时连队的民工用面条和他换一些来做菜。有一次，我问他为什么不卖一些香菇换钱，他叹了一口气说：“卖香菇要到县城古宜镇，坐小船得划上一整天，来回两天，中间住上一夜，卖香菇的钱还不够吃住的花销呢。”原来当地人培植香菇，大多是自己用的。
    侗家人好客，特别是对外乡人。那一晚，韦叔的老伴韦婶请我们几个民工去她家打油茶。韦婶先把阴米（晒干的米饭）放到锅里炒，边炒边解释说：“阴米最好用糯米饭晒，可山里田少，种的粮还不够吃饭，哪有糯米打油茶？”爆好了米花，韦婶从茶砖上剥下一把老茶叶煮茶水，然后把米花装进碗里冲上茶水，给我们每人端了一碗。我常听说侗家的油茶出名，现在一喝，又苦又涩，茶水在喉咙边直打转转，就是吞不下去。我偷偷地望了韦婶一眼，她正用不安和企盼的目光看着我们，看得出，如果我们不喝，她心里是很难过的。我心一横，一口气把油茶喝完，还言不由衷地说：“好喝！好喝！”那天晚上，我是怀着对侗族兄弟怜惜的心情离开韦叔家的。
    今年春节前，我到六孟火车站搞春运，想不到，又有机会在侗乡打油茶。十几年后的六孟，已今非昔比，枝柳铁路通车以后，这个小山村完全变了样，原来的那些吊脚楼不见了，展现在眼前的是一排排红砖瓦房。在车站货场里，堆满了待运的木材和硅矿石。车站南头的一块空场地，不知从什么时候起就自发地形成了一个小市场，猪肉、青菜、烟糖百货等生活必需品基本齐全，更多的是香菇、木耳、竹笋干之类的土产山货，一包包堆放在地上，从柳州、融安等地来的商贩，和卖货的老乡在激烈地讨价还价。小山村呈现出一片热闹的景象。
    请我打油茶的东家是六孟车站梁师傅的堂兄。梁兄家里也是种香菇的。梁兄30多岁，精神焕发，红光满面，穿一套浅灰色的西装，白衬衣上还系着一条红色的花领带，不知底细，还以为他是哪个公司的“经理”。梁兄告诉我：由于有了铁路，交通方便多了，香菇的销路越来越广，价格也越来越高。梁兄家的油茶花样多，阴米是正宗的三江大糯，佐料有猪肝、粉肠和花生碎。油茶打好以后，梁兄豪爽地招呼我：“到了三江，不打油茶不是我们侗家的客人，来一碗！”我记起第一次喝油茶的滋味，心里有点踌躇，但又盛情难却，端起碗小心地喝了一口，一时只觉得一股很舒服的气流，从喉咙直贯心里，油茶味甘中带甜，苦中藏香，再吃一点猪肝粉肠糯米花，脆口醇香。我按侗家人的习惯一连喝了三碗，还真有点舍不得放碗。我又想起了韦叔一家，他们现在的生活不用说也一定变好了吧，因为他家也种了很多香菇，如果我再到他家打油茶的话，可能会比梁兄打的油茶更甜，更香。
