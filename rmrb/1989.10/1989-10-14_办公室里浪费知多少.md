Recently, I investigated the procurement, usage, and expenditure of office supplies in more than 10 departments in Nantong. I found that waste is very common.

Stationery is used freely. For a long time, many government offices have provided stationery without restriction, leading some officials to use them extravagantly. Some scribble on blank paper; others use official envelopes and document folders as personal shopping bags or wrapping paper. According to some primary and secondary schools, many students use their parents' office stationery.

Personal calls are charged to the office. Some people make personal long-distance calls from the office and charge them to the public account. Many units exceed their telephone budget. For instance, a bureau-level office in a certain county paid over 1,700 yuan in telephone fees last year, with a significant portion being personal calls.

Publicly subscribed newspapers and magazines often end up in private hands. Many offices subscribe to public newspapers and magazines, but many of these end up being privately owned. Some subscriptions are made to satisfy the interests of a few individuals in the office; others lack management, leading to a habit where whoever gets their hands on them first keeps them. For example, an office for retired cadres in a certain county spent hundreds of yuan last year subscribing to several literary magazines and pictorials, but none of the publications were ever officially placed in the activity room. Some offices also purchase high-end items like color televisions, tape recorders, and cameras, but due to poor management, some of these items are left idle for long periods, and some are even stolen or privately owned.

The issues of lights left on and water running continuously are even more widespread. Some people use electric heaters for warmth and to boil water. Many faucets leak water continuously without anyone fixing them.

The severe waste in office supplies consumes a large amount of administrative funds and corrupts the minds of office staff. To address this, we need to strengthen propaganda and education, implement strict management systems, formulate frugal measures, and include the frugal use of office funds in the office's target responsibility system. Only then can we truly revive the spirit of frugality in party and government offices.

### 办公室里浪费知多少

    办公室里浪费知多少
    不久前，我调查了南通10多个部门的办公用品添置、使用及开支情况，发现浪费现象很普遍。
    笔墨纸张敞开用。长期以来，许多机关办公室里的笔墨纸张都是敞开供应，故一些干部使用时大手大脚。有的在白纸上乱涂乱画；有的用公用信封、文件袋当私人购物袋、包装纸。据一些中小学校反映，有不少学生使用父母单位的公用信笺。
    私人电话公费开支。有的人在机关打私人长途电话，记在公家帐上。许多单位电话费超支。某县一局级机关去年支付的电话费中，私人电话费达1700多元。
    公用报刊多归私有。许多机关都订了公用报刊，但不少归私有。有些报刊就是为满足机关里少数人的兴趣而订的；有的单位对公用报刊缺乏管理，形成公用报刊谁先拿到就归谁的习惯。如某县局机关老干部活动室去年花数百元订了几种文艺杂志和画报，但刊物一到即被个人拿去，活动室里从没有正式放过一本刊物。有的机关办公室里还购置了彩电、收录机、照相机等高档用品，因管理不善，有的长期闲置，有的甚至被偷盗或归私有。
    长明灯、长流水的情况更为普遍。有的人用电炉取暖、烧开水。有些水龙头长期漏水无人修。
    机关办公室浪费严重，占用了大笔行政经费，也腐蚀了机关干部职工的思想。对此，要加强宣传教育，严格管理制度，制订节约措施，把节约办公经费列入机关目标责任制，真正使节约之风在党政机关重新兴起。
