In the early hours of June 22, Chang Jinfang, the secretary of the Party branch of Maoshu Village, Chengguan Town, Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, was murdered by a criminal. His wife and son were also severely injured. As people cleared away Jinfang's belongings with tears in their eyes, they found that his family had only one television, one old sewing machine, and 20 yuan in cash. There were also several caves that had been under construction for eight years but were still unfinished. The village-owned coal mine that Jinfang had devoted his heart and soul to produced 150 tons of raw coal per day and made a profit of over 300,000 yuan per year. He, Chang Jinfang, had no savings and no inheritance. He was sincere and selfless, dedicating his short life entirely to the Party and the people. People called him the "Iron Man of Taihang."

Maoshu Village is located on a hillside to the west of Xiangyuan County. The terrain is steep, the soil is thin, and water is scarce. There is no industry, and there are few sideline occupations. Farmers rely solely on farming, making it difficult for them to become wealthy. The 100-plus households in the village live in narrow, dilapidated houses. Money is tight, and any illness or disaster can be overwhelming. Seeing this, Chang Jinfang couldn't eat or sleep. He and the Party branch committee members, as well as the village committee members, held meetings night after night, seeking a path to prosperity for Maoshu Village.

In 1982, Chang Jinfang used the funds collected from the villagers to start a brick kiln. Just as 200,000 bricks were ready, a nearby coal mine dug a deep well, draining all the water from the Maoshu brick kiln. Without water, the kiln had to stop operating. Chang Jinfang looked at the newly baked bricks and said, "We'll find another place to work!"

In 1983, Chang Jinfang studied the history of Maoshu Village and invited experts from the county's mining company to survey and assess the feasibility of starting a coal mine. He first tried to deepen an old mine shaft, but the mine walls collapsed, the tunnels were blocked, there was a lot of water, and the air was thin, making it impossible for people to go down. Chang Jinfang felt like he had been hit with a hammer.

Chang Jinfang called a meeting of the branch committee and said, "The old mine shaft is no good, but we can't just give up and become softies. We have to keep going!"

In October 1984, Maoshu Village began digging a new shaft. At 152 meters, they hit coal, but water seeped in. The 13 branch committee members and village committee members worked in shifts to pump out the water. Chang Jinfang was at the site every day, from morning to night, never leaving the mine. Once, he fainted from exhaustion in the mine. When people pulled him up, his first words were, "You all go down!" Finally, they pumped out all the water in the mine.

Chang Jinfang led by example, and the cadres donated their remaining building materials or materials they had prepared for building houses to the coal mine. Chang Jinfang and Deputy Mine Manager Li Xianwu went to a nearby large coal mine to seek help, borrowing unused old equipment and picking up usable parts from the scrap heap. The hoisting equipment at the mine shaft was finally completed. In February 1986, the Maoshu coal mine started producing coal. When the first bucket of black coal was hoisted up, Chang Jinfang said, "There are 270 households in Maoshu Village. Let's send each household a carload of coal to taste the freshness!" By August of this year, the small coal mine was producing over 150 tons of coal per day, and the road to the coal mine had been paved and leveled.

Chang Jinfang cared about the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the 200-plus households in Maoshu Village, as well as their weddings, funerals, and childbirths.

One morning, Chang Jinfang's wife, Duan Yumei, gave him 10 yuan to buy some milk powder for the child. As soon as he stepped out, he met Liu Xingshun, who looked worried. Chang Jinfang asked, "Xingshun, what's wrong?" Liu Xingshun said, "My wife has intestinal bleeding and is about to die..." Chang Jinfang handed him the 10 yuan, "Here, go see a doctor first. I'll help you find more money later." Chang Jinfang also borrowed money for him, and Liu Xingshun's wife was cured.

The white-haired Sha Manlin's son chopped off his right hand's five fingers while chopping straw, becoming disabled. Chang Jinfang visited the old man and said, "Uncle, don't worry, this is socialism!" After the coal mine started operating, Sha Manlin's son, Sha Zhiguo, was hired to manage and repair the mine lamps, earning over 150 yuan a month. Chang Jinfang also did not forget Niu Baogui. Niu Baogui's wife had uterine cancer, and he was crying and sniffling. Chang Jinfang borrowed 3,000 yuan for him, and the disease was cured. He was willing to suffer himself, letting others live well first. When the brick kiln workers couldn't get their wages, Chang Jinfang sold his family's fat pig, giving each person a dozen yuan. When the coal mine needed wood, he took the cubic meter of wood he had bought to make doors and windows and pulled it to the mine; when the coal mine needed diesel, he first took the diesel he had saved and took it to the mine. Chang Jinfang also led the way by contributing 50 yuan, and the entire village raised over 4,000 yuan to improve the conditions of the primary school. Now, Maoshu Village has implemented free education. Chang Jinfang said, "Other things can be delayed, but education cannot be postponed."

Chang Jinfang regarded maintaining rural social order as a glorious duty. He knew that the countryside had just taken the first steps towards prosperity, and that social stability, order, and peace of mind were essential for economic development. For young people who had fallen into the mire of crime due to bad habits, he assisted the public security department in severely cracking down on them. Yue Zhonghua was a repeat offender who committed theft while wearing a mask. Chang Jinfang actively assisted in his arrest. After Yue Zhonghua was released from prison, Chang Jinfang introduced him to a nearby coal mine to work as a miner. But Yue Zhonghua did not change his ways and was fired from the coal mine for fighting. Since then, Yue Zhonghua has been wandering around, committing multiple crimes. He held a grudge against Chang Jinfang and waited for an opportunity to take revenge. In the early hours of June 22, Yue Zhonghua, carrying three sharp knives, jumped into Chang Jinfang's courtyard, shouting, "I'm here to take revenge!" Chang Jinfang was murdered without any defense. The public security authorities immediately arrested the murderer, Yue Zhonghua.

Jinfang died at the age of 38. The cause he created is unforgettable. Over 1,000 fellow villagers gathered in the village committee's courtyard to mourn him, and the cries echoed through the Taihang Mountains...

The Communist Party of China's Shanxi Provincial Committee and Changzhi Municipal Committee successively made decisions, requiring rural Party members to learn from Chang Jinfang and posthumously recognizing him as a revolutionary martyr.

    太行硬汉
    ——记山西襄垣县姚树村党支部书记常金芳
    王艾生　王矛盾
    6月22日凌晨，山西省襄垣县城关镇桃树村党支部书记常金芳，被歹徒杀害。他的妻子、儿子也被歹徒砍成重伤。当人们含着泪水清理金芳的遗物时发现，他家只有一台电视机、一台旧缝纫机和20元钱，还有修了8年还没有修成的几孔窑洞。而常金芳倾注了全部心血的村办煤矿，日产原煤150吨，年盈利30多万元。他，常金芳，没有存款，没有遗产。他真诚，无私，把短短的一生全部献给党，献给人民，人们称他为“太行山上硬汉”。
    桃树村，在襄垣县城西的一个山圪梁上，坡陡，地薄，缺水。没有工业，副业也少得可怜，农民全靠种地，要富起来难啦。全村100多户人家住的房屋窄小，破烂，用钱困难，有病有灾就支撑不住了。常金芳眼看着这情景，吃不下，睡不着，他和党支委们，村民委员会的委员们，几夜几夜地开会，寻求桃树村致富的路。
    1982年，常金芳将村民集资的钱办起了一个砖窑，刚刚烧出20万块砖，临近的一个煤矿打深井，把桃树砖窑的井水全部泄光了。砖窑没水，只得停工。常金芳瞧着刚烧成的砖坯，只吐出几个字：“另外找地方干！”
    1983年，常金芳调查了桃树村的历史，请县矿业公司的专家来勘查，论证，提出办煤矿。他先是利用一个旧矿井往深处打，结果发现井壁坍塌，巷道堵塞，积水很多，空气稀薄，人无法下去。常金芳像当头挨了一棒。
    常金芳召开支委会说：“旧矿井是不行了，可我们不能就这样倒下成了软骨头，还得干！”
    1984年10月，桃树村又开始打新井，打到152米，见了煤，但又透了水，13个支委、村委，两人一班，轮班下井抽水。常金芳天天到班，从早到晚不离矿井。一次，他下井疲劳过度，休克在井下，当人们把他提升上来，他头一句话是“你们快下！”。终于把井下的水抽净了。
    常金芳带头，干部们把自己盖房子剩下的或准备盖房子用的木材、水泥、钢材……拿到煤矿。常金芳又同副矿长李显武到附近的大煤矿求援，将人家不用的旧设备借来，在人家的废铁堆里拣回可用的配件，零件，井口提升设备终于建成。1986年2月，桃树煤矿出煤了。当第一罐黑油油的煤炭提升上井时，常金芳说：“桃树村270户，每户送一车，让村民们尝尝鲜！”到今年8月，小煤窑日产煤150余吨，通往煤窑的道路已修通，铺平。
    常金芳惦记着桃树村200多户的衣食住行，婚丧嫁娶，修房盖屋，生儿育女……
    一天早晨，常金芳的爱人段玉梅给他10元钱，让他给小孩买点奶粉。刚出门就碰上刘兴顺，见他一脸愁云，金芳关切地问：“兴顺，你又咋啦？”刘兴顺说：“老婆大肠出血，眼看要不行……”金芳顺手掏出10元钱：“给，先去请医生，回头我再给你张罗。”金芳又给他借下钱，治好了刘兴顺老婆的病。
    白发苍苍的沙满林儿子在铡秸秆时铡断右手5个指头，成了残废。常金芳去看望老人说：“大伯，你放心，咱这是社会主义呀！”煤矿开办后，让老人的儿子沙治国在煤窑看管、修理矿灯，月收入150余元。常金芳也没有忘记牛保贵。牛保贵的爱人得了子宫癌，急得鼻涕一把，泪一把。金芳帮他借了3000元，治好了病。他宁肯自己受苦，先让他人过好日子。村上砖窑工人发不了工资，金芳把自家的肥猪卖了，一人发十几元。煤矿缺木材，把自己买的一立方准备做门窗的木材拉去；煤矿缺柴油，先把自家留的柴油拿去。常金芳还带头拿出50元，在全村共集资4000多元，改善了小学校的办学条件，现在，桃树村已实行了免费上学。金芳说：“别的事可以缓办，办学的事不能拖。”
    常金芳把维护乡村社会治安当作光荣职责。他深知，农村刚刚迈上富裕路，村上社会安定，秩序安定，人心安定，经济才能发展。对于染上恶习陷入犯罪泥潭的青年，他协助公安部门予以严厉打击。岳中华是个屡教不改的蒙面行窃的罪犯，常金芳主动协助擒拿归案。岳中华刑满后，常金芳将他介绍到附近的煤矿当上矿工。但岳中华恶习不改，又因打架被煤矿开除。从此，岳中华流窜在外，多次作案。他对常金芳怀恨在心，伺机报复。今年6月22日凌晨，岳中华身带3把锐刀，跳到常金芳院里，声称“我是来报仇的”。常金芳在没有防备的情况下，残遭杀害。公安机关当即抓获杀人凶手岳中华。
    金芳死了，年仅38岁，他创的事业使人们难以忘怀。1000多名老乡，挤在村委会的大院里悼念他，哭声震荡在太行山峦……
    中共山西省委、长治市委先后作出决定，要求农村广大党员向常金芳同志学习，并追认他为革命烈士。
