At today's meeting of the entire staff of the State Council's tax, financial, and price inspection task force, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun pointed out that we must simultaneously push forward with reform and opening up and with supervision and inspection. These two aspects are complementary and inseparable and must be consistently emphasized. During the period of rectification and adjustment and in the future, financial and price inspections must be carried out persistently and cannot be relaxed. Through these inspections, we must strictly investigate and deal with various illegal and disciplinary violations, enforce financial and economic discipline, and create conditions for carrying out rectification and adjustment and deepening reform.

It is understood that from 1981 to 1988, six major inspections were conducted, uncovering a total of 53.2 billion yuan in violations. Of this amount, 32.6 billion yuan was turned over to the treasury. These inspections have made positive contributions to increasing fiscal revenue, balancing the fiscal budget, stabilizing the economy, controlling prices, and promoting reform and construction. They have also played an important role in correcting improper practices and curbing some illegal and disciplinary violations. To advance this year's inspections, the State Council has established a task force consisting of 137 people in 29 groups, which will depart on October 21 to assist and guide work in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The task force includes 26 ministers, 34 division and bureau-level officials, 18 members of the National People's Congress, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and members of various democratic parties.

Tian Jiyun said in his speech that under the new situation where the Party Central Committee and the State Council have proposed to punish corruption and promote clean governance, it is particularly important to strengthen supervision and inspection work. The purpose of conducting financial and price inspections is to further strengthen the rule of law, enforce financial and economic discipline, and ensure that laws are strictly followed and violations are punished. This will gradually eliminate the roots of illegal and disciplinary violations.

Tian Jiyun said that financial and price inspections must be combined with rectification and adjustment and deepening reform, and must serve these goals. To achieve this, the following aspects must be emphasized in the inspections:

First, we must strengthen education on the rule of law, discipline, and the overall situation among the broad masses of cadres and the people. Solving problems of illegal and disciplinary violations requires not only treating the symptoms but also addressing the root causes. We must link violations to the education of the "three consciousnesses" (rule of law, discipline, and the overall situation), raise people's ideological awareness, and recognize the harmfulness of illegal and disciplinary violations. We must strive to reduce various illegal and disciplinary violations to the lowest possible level.

Second, we must strictly investigate and deal with various illegal and disciplinary violations. This year's inspections must strictly implement national regulations on penalties for violations of financial, tax, price, and audit laws. Especially for those who do not seriously conduct self-inspections and whose problems are discovered by the task force, we must handle them seriously. Not only must we confiscate and fine them economically, but we must also give them necessary administrative handling. For those who repeatedly violate the law and whose violations are serious, we must expose them in the media and handle them publicly; for those who violate the law, we must hand them over to the judicial authorities for legal punishment.

Third, we must propose improvement measures based on the illegal and disciplinary violations uncovered, improve financial and economic systems, plug loopholes, and strengthen management.

Tian Jiyun finally emphasized that the task force dispatched by the State Council is going down to assist and promote local inspections on behalf of the State Council. He hopes that the task force members will work hard, be frugal and hardworking, and be clean and upright, setting an example.

    田纪云在国务院有关会议上强调
    财务物价大检查不能放松
    邀请人大、政协和民主党派人士参加检查
    本报北京10月14日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：在今天召开的国务院税收财务物价大检查工作组全体成员会议上，田纪云副总理指出，一手抓改革开放，一手抓监督检查，这是相辅相成，不可分割的两个方面，自始至终都要抓住不放。在治理整顿及今后一个较长时期内，税收财务物价大检查要坚持不懈地开展下去，决不能放松。要通过大检查，从严查处各种违法乱纪行为，严肃财经纪律，为搞好治理整顿、深化改革创造条件。
    据了解，从1981年至1988年，已进行了6次大检查，共查出违纪金额532亿元，其中上交财政326亿元，为增加财政收入，平衡财政预算，稳定经济，平抑物价，促进改革和建设作出了积极贡献；对纠正不正之风，遏止一部分违法乱纪行为也发挥了重要作用。为推进今年的大检查，国务院已组建了由137人组成的29个工作组，将于10月21日分赴各省、自治区、直辖市帮助指导工作。检查组成员中包括部级干部26人，司局级干部34人，全国人大代表、政协委员和各民主党派成员18人。
    田纪云在讲话中说，在党中央、国务院提出惩治腐败，搞好廉政建设的新形势下，加强监督检查工作尤为重要。开展财税物价大检查的目的，是要进一步加强法制观念，严肃财经纪律，做到有法必依，违法必究，逐步铲除违法乱纪的根源。
    田纪云说，要把大检查同治理整顿、深化改革结合起来，并为其服务。要达到这个目的，在大检查中必须抓好以下几方面的工作：
    第一，要加强对广大干部群众法制观念、纪律观念和全局观念的教育。解决违法违纪问题只治表不行，还要治本。要联系违纪事实，深入开展“三个观念”的教育，提高人们的思想觉悟。要把制止偷税漏税、乱挤成本、截留利润、虚报亏损等违反财经纪律的行为，提高到反腐败、抓廉政的高度来认识。提高人们对违法违纪危害性的认识，自觉遵纪守法，力求把各种违法乱纪行为减少到最低程度。
    第二，要从严查处各种违法违纪行为。今年大检查中必须严格执行国家有关违反财政、税收、物价、审计等法规的处罚规定，特别是对那些不认真自查而被工作组查出的问题，更要严肃处理，不仅在经济上要没收、罚款，在行政上也要给予必要的处理。对屡查屡犯、情节严重的，要在报上揭露，公开处理；对违法的要交司法部门依法惩处。
    第三，要针对查出的违法乱纪问题提出改进措施，完善财经制度，堵塞漏洞，加强管理。
    田纪云最后强调，国务院派出的工作组，是代表国务院下去帮助和推动地方搞好大检查的。他希望工作组的同志下去后要努力工作，艰苦朴素，廉洁奉公，作出表率。
