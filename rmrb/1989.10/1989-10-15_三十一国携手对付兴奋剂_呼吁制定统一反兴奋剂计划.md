The second World Conference Against Doping in Sports concluded in Moscow on October 12. Representatives from 31 countries agreed that a unified anti-doping plan must be established and doping detection methods improved to ensure the healthy development of sports.

The conference, which began on October 10, saw participants engage in heated discussions on emergency measures to stop the use of doping and improve detection methods. Although no specific results were achieved, the conference suggested that the International Olympic Committee include the Olympic Anti-Doping Charter in the Olympic Charter to emphasize the importance of opposing doping.

A doping detection method invented by Manfred Donik, a member of the International Olympic Committee's Medical Commission from West Germany, was a key topic of discussion. The method involves detecting the steroid content in athletes' bodies to identify doping. Once doping is used, the natural steroid content in the body changes. Even if doping is stopped several months before a competition, this method can still reveal its use.

Tamás Aján, the general secretary of the International Weightlifting Federation, announced at the meeting that the federation is preparing to adopt this new method. However, many experts present believed the method is not yet perfect and lacks scientific evidence to prove its reliability. Whether this new method can become the ultimate solution to doping remains to be seen over time. It was announced that the third World Conference Against Doping in Sports will be held in Norway in 1991.

    三十一国携手对付兴奋剂
    呼吁制定统一反兴奋剂计划
    新华社莫斯科10月13日电　（记者张志强）第二届世界反对在体育运动中使用兴奋剂大会12日在莫斯科结束，来自31个国家的代表一致认为，必须制定一个统一的反兴奋剂计划，完善兴奋剂检查手段，以使体育运动健康发展。
    这次会议是10日开始的，会议期间，与会者就采取紧急措施制止使用兴奋剂和完善兴奋剂检查手段等问题进行了热烈讨论，虽未取得具体成果，但会议建议国际奥委会将奥林匹克反兴奋剂宪章列入奥林匹克宪章，以强调反对使用兴奋剂问题的重要性。
    国际奥委会医学委员会成员、联邦德国的曼弗雷德·多尼克教授发明的检查兴奋剂方法是此次会议讨论的一项重要内容。据悉，该方法是通过检测运动员体内类固醇含量来发现兴奋剂的。一旦使用兴奋剂，人体内类固醇的自然含量便会发生变化。即使在赛前几个月停止使用兴奋剂，该方法也能查出使用情况。
    国际举重联合会总干事塔马斯·阿贾恩在会上宣布，国际举联准备采用这种新方法。然而许多与会专家认为该方法不够完善，而且缺乏能证明其可靠性的科学论证。这种新方法能否成为兴奋剂的克星看来尚需时间的检验。据宣布，第三届世界反对在体育运动中使用兴奋剂大会将于1991年在挪威举行。
