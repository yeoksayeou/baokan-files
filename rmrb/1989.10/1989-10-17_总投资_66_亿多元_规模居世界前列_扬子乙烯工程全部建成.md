Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 16th - A large-scale aromatic hydrocarbon production facility, ranking among the world's top, began trial operations on October 15th at Yangzi Petrochemical Company. This marks the completion of the Yangzi 300,000-ton ethylene project.

The Yangzi 300,000-ton ethylene project includes 10 large-scale chemical production facilities, primarily producing 300,000 tons of ethylene and 450,000 tons of aromatic hydrocarbons. Its products include dozens of types of plastics, chemical fibers, and other organic chemical raw materials. The total investment for the entire project is 6.683 billion yuan, making it the largest petrochemical integrated enterprise built in a single investment since the founding of the nation.

Construction of the Yangzi ethylene project began in June 1984. In the two years since the first phase of the project was completed and put into operation, it has produced over 600,000 tons of various organic chemical raw materials, mainly plastic raw materials, generating 860 million yuan in profits and taxes. After the completion of the second phase, Yangzi ethylene began providing organic chemical raw materials primarily for chemical fibers, making the product structure more rational and significantly improving the comprehensive utilization rate of crude oil.

    总投资66亿多元　规模居世界前列
    扬子乙烯工程全部建成
    据新华社南京10月16日电（记者费强、陈妩）一套规模在世界上名列前茅的芳烃联合生产装置，10月15日在扬子石化公司投料试车。这标志着扬子30万吨乙烯工程已全部建成。
    扬子30万吨乙烯工程，包括以30万吨乙烯、45万吨芳烃为主的10套大型化工生产装置。它的产品包括几十种塑料、化纤和其他有机化工原料。整个工程总投资为66.83亿元，是建国以来一次性投资建设的最大的石油化工联合企业。
    扬子乙烯工程于1984年6月动工兴建。第一阶段工程建成投产两年来，已生产以塑料原料为主的各种有机化工原料60多万吨，创利税8.6亿元；第二阶段工程建成后，扬子乙烯开始提供以化纤原料为主的有机化工原料，产品结构趋向合理，原油综合利用率大幅度提高。
