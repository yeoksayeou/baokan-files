Sylvia Plath (1932–1963) was one of the representative poets of the "Confessional" school in the United States. She was born in Boston, her father being a naturalized American of Polish-German descent and a biology professor at Boston University. She began writing poetry and short stories at the age of eight and started publishing her works during her teenage years. In 1953, she graduated from Smith College and subsequently received a scholarship to study for a master's degree at Cambridge University in the UK. In 1956, she married the renowned British poet Ted Hughes. After giving birth to a daughter and a son, they separated in the early 1960s due to Hughes' infidelity.

Plath was a disciple of Robert Lowell, the founder of the "Confessional" poetry movement, and had taken his poetry writing course at Boston University. In 1960, she published her first poetry collection, *The Colossus*, which garnered attention from literary critics. Thereafter, she entered a golden age of poetry creation, producing a series of "Confessional" works under Lowell's influence, which were published in the collection *Ariel*. This collection was reprinted seven times and won the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. Her poetic style is straightforward and candid, clear and understandable, with few metaphors, much like a heart-to-heart conversation between close friends. Her German heritage also imbued her poetry with a certain philosophical quality.

Plath had a particular interest in the subject of death, and many of her poems describe the abnormal psychological states of suicide victims. She was introverted and melancholic, with a sensitive and introspective mind. She once said, "My life has been a sort of prolonged teacup existence." She wrote an autobiographical novel describing her inner life, titled *The Bell Jar* (1963). Psychological repression and mental disorder tormented her like a demon, yet this mental chaos was preserved in her poetry with a clear pen, which is the essence of Plath's poetic charm. It is said that she attempted suicide several times but ultimately succeeded on February 11, 1963, at the age of 30, in a state of extreme mental confusion by gassing herself.

Her posthumous works were compiled and published as *Ariel*, *Crossing the Water*, and *Winter Trees*, sparking a heated response in the American poetry scene and marking another high point in the confessional poetry movement. In recent years, her reputation has continued to rise, and she is now widely recognized as one of the most outstanding poets in contemporary world literature.

    “笼在钟罩”里的女诗人
    黎华
    希尔维娅·普拉斯（1932—1963），美国“自白派”代表诗人之一。出生于波士顿，父亲是归化美国的波兰籍德国人，波士顿大学生物教授。她8岁就开始习写诗歌和短篇小说，少女时代就开始发表作品。1953年她毕业于斯密斯学院，旋即又获奖学金去英国剑桥大学攻读硕士学位。1956年她与英国著名青年诗人塔特·休斯结婚，婚后生一女一子，60年代初因丈夫另有新欢而凄然分居。
    普拉斯是“自白派”诗歌创始人洛威尔的高足，曾在波士顿大学听他讲诗歌写作课。1960年她出版处女诗集《巨大的雕像》，得到文学批评家们的重视。此后她就步入诗歌创作的黄金时代，在洛威尔的影响下，创作了一批“自白派”的作品，收入《爱丽尔》一集中出版。这本诗集曾7次再版，并获1982年度的普利策诗歌奖。她的诗风直率坦诚，清晰明白，很少隐喻，恰似亲人间的促膝谈心，日耳曼血统也使她的诗歌带上了一定的思辨特色。
    普拉斯对死亡问题有特殊的兴趣，不少诗作主要描写自杀者反常的心理状态。她性格忧郁内向，心灵敏感多思。她曾说：“我的一生都是笼在一个钟罩似的环境中晃过来的。”她曾写了一本描写自己内心生活的自传体长篇小说，书名就叫《钟形的罩》（1963）。心理压抑和精神紊乱像恶魔一样纠缠着她，然而这种混乱的心理在她诗歌中又以清晰的笔调保留了下来，这正是构成普拉斯诗歌魅力所在。据说她几次自杀未遂，而在1963年2月11日她30岁时，终于在极度的精神错乱中吸煤气自杀身死。
    她的遗稿陆续编成《爱丽尔》、《渡湖》、《冬树》出版，在美国诗坛上激起了热烈的反应，成为自白诗运动的又一个高潮。近几年来，她的声望日益升高，被公认为当代世界英语作家中最优秀的诗人之一。
