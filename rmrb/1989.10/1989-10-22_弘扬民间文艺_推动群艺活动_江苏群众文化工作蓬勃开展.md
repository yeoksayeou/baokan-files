At the recently concluded China Arts Festival East China Division, the Jiangsu Provincial Folk Arts Troupe's three performances were not only sold out but also saw audiences waiting outside for refunds. Two officials from other provincial cultural departments expressed their intention to establish similar folk arts troupes in their own provinces.

In recent years, various regions in Jiangsu have placed great emphasis on mass cultural work, actively promoting community culture, rural culture, enterprise culture, and campus culture, among other forms of mass cultural activities. These efforts have played a significant role in enhancing the quality of laborers, popularizing scientific and cultural knowledge, boosting production enthusiasm, and maintaining social order. Additionally, numerous high-quality dance, drama, and variety show programs have emerged. The dance "Carrying Fresh Lotus Roots," with its unique anthropomorphic concept, vividly portrays the joy of labor and the happiness of harvest for girls from the water towns. It won the first prize in three categories—creation, performance, and guidance—at the National Folk Music and Dance Competition. The dance has been performed by over 20 art troupes nationwide and has toured more than a dozen countries, including the United States, Canada, and Japan. The performance troupe of the Suzhou Rural Town Cultural Center, the Nantong Folk Arts Troupe, and the Chongshu Town Farmers' Orchestra in Changshu City have not only performed in Beijing but also at Zhongnanhai for a report performance.

To showcase the outstanding achievements of mass arts in Jiangsu in recent years, the province gathered excellent mass arts programs and established the Provincial Folk Arts Troupe in March this year. After intensive rehearsals, the troupe toured 12 cities in the province, performing over 30 shows and attracting an audience of 30,000. The performances received widespread acclaim. Despite heavy rain during the performances in Wuxi, the auditorium remained full.

In Xuzhou, the arts troupe coincidentally performed at the same time as a new wave dance troupe from another region. The audience for the arts troupe grew with each performance, while the audience for the dance troupe dwindled, creating a stark contrast.

The Jiangsu Provincial Folk Arts Troupe not only promoted folk arts but also directly drove mass arts activities in various regions. Wherever the troupe performed, local authorities organized various mass arts activities, either holding performances or professional training classes. Many cities selected their local outstanding programs to participate in the troupe's performances. Everyone exchanged ideas and enjoyed the process. Many grassroots mass arts workers were eager: mass arts have great potential, and in the next provincial folk arts activity, we must strive to make a name for ourselves!

　　弘扬民间文艺　推动群艺活动
　　江苏群众文化工作蓬勃开展
    本报南京10月21日电　记者龚永泉报道：在最近降下帷幕的中国艺术节华东分会场上，江苏省民间艺术团的三场演出不仅场场客满，而且出现了观众场外等退票的情景。有两个省文化部门的负责同志表示也要把本省的民间艺术团组建起来。
    近年来，江苏各地十分重视群众文化工作，大力开展社区文化、村镇文化、企业文化、校园文化等群众文化活动形式，为提高劳动者的素质，普及科学文化知识，激发群众生产热情，维护社会秩序起到了较好的作用。同时，涌现出不少较高水平的舞蹈、戏剧、曲艺节目。舞蹈《担鲜藕》，以拟人化的独特构思，将水乡姑娘劳动的欢愉与丰收的喜悦表现得淋漓尽致，曾获全国民间音乐舞蹈比赛创作、表演、辅导三项一等奖，并被全国20多个艺术表演团体移植上演，先后到美国、加拿大、日本等十几个国家演出。苏州市农村集镇文化中心演出队、南通民间艺术团、常熟市董浜乡农民管弦乐团不仅先后进京演出，而且进了中南海作汇报演出。
    为了展示全省群众文艺近年来取得的硕果，江苏省把涌现的优秀群众文艺节目集中起来，于今年3月成立了省民间艺术团。集中排练后，赴全省12个市巡回演出30余场，观众达3万人次，受到各界人士的赞赏。在无锡演出时，尽管场外大雨滂沱，但场内座无虚席。
    在徐州市，艺术团正巧与外地一新潮歌舞团同期上演，艺术团的观众一场比一场多，而那个歌舞团的观众一场比一场少，形成了鲜明的对比。
    江苏省民间艺术团不仅弘扬了民间文艺，还直接推动了各地的群众文艺活动。艺术团所到之处，各地纷纷举办各种群众文艺活动，或举行会演，或举办专业培训班。不少市还选出当地的优秀节目参加艺术团的演出。大家相互切磋，其乐融融。许多基层的群众文艺干部摩拳擦掌：群众文艺大有搞头，下一次全省民间艺术活动要争取搞出点名堂！
