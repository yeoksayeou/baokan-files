This spring, at the Leipzig International Trade Fair, the Chinese-made Kenaire BCD220 refrigerator won the international gold medal among strong competitors. In July, at the Beijing International Trade Fair, within just five days, Hong Kong customers alone ordered 18,000 units, with a transaction amount of $4.532 million, making it a standout in China's refrigerator industry.

In Tianjin, after introducing second-hand equipment from abroad, several products quickly became leading items within a short period and were then exported. Apart from the Kenaire refrigerator, there is also the popular Sprider bicycle. Sprider is known for being light, fast, and beautiful, described as "the most loved car by modern people produced in the simplest way." At the end of last year, it won the Golden Dragon Flying Award for technological progress in the national light industry product evaluation and was listed as one of the 10 leading products for quality in Tianjin. The Xinda motorcycle, with its modern design and excellent performance, won the team championship in the 80 series at the national motorcycle race in October last year and took the top three spots in the individual race, also winning the Golden Dragon Flying Award. The heavy industry sector is not lagging behind. Tianjin Steel Rolling Mill No. 3 introduced a complete set of second-hand steel smelting equipment with a 35-ton electric furnace in June 1984. After starting production, it quickly transformed from a single-roll mill producing ordinary carbon steel to a special steel mill focusing on high-quality steel production.

Speed brings double the results with half the effort. In March 1983, when Tianjin learned that the French company Bouquet-Naix was bankrupt and looking for buyers for its equipment used for about five years, it immediately sent a team to France. After several rounds of tough negotiations, they signed a contract at a price equivalent to $3.4 million. This cost is almost the same as the price Guangzhou paid for the Hitachi refrigerator production line, but its annual production capacity of 400,000 units is four times that of the Hitachi line! After that, dismantling, factory construction, installation, debugging... by 1987, the trial production of 43,000 units was realized, with a tax profit of 8.5 million yuan, and 2,000 units were exported, earning $600,000 in foreign exchange. This became the only enterprise in China's refrigerator industry to achieve large-scale production, profit, and foreign exchange earnings in the same year.

International trade wars change in the blink of an eye. Whoever can seize that fleeting opportunity is the winner. When Tianjin learned about the bankruptcy auction of the Munich Derada Company, it quickly sent a team to the Federal Republic of Germany to negotiate the purchase of the complete Derada motorcycle production line. Not only were there domestic competitors, but also foreign ones, some of whom offered higher prices. However, Tianjin's upper and lower levels worked at a pace as fast as lightning. The motorcycle expert team completed visa applications, purchased tickets, obtained foreign exchange, and prepared for the trip in just 7 hours from receiving the task to boarding the plane... in the Federal Republic of Germany, from inspection to signing the contract, it took only two days and nights. Dismantling and shipping 691 containers took only 100 days, and constructing a 44,000-square-meter factory took only 11 months... in 1988, it started production and broke the 10,000-unit mark in the same year. The Sprider bicycle production line achieved the goals of introduction, installation, trial production, and benefits in the same year.

Efficiency is life. Because of the word "fast," a complete set of equipment and software for producing 100,000 motorcycles a year was purchased by Tianjin, China, at a price 200 million West German Marks cheaper than a certain country in Asia. Tianjin Steel Rolling Mill No. 3, from introducing the equipment to smelting steel, was one month faster than the British when they renovated the steel smelting plant. The next year, they had already smelted 5,472 tons of high-quality steel. Technological progress has made the factory's profits and taxes in the past five years 15 times higher than when it was first built. The price they paid for introducing this second-hand equipment from Britain was only 1/4 of the price of similar new equipment abroad. Spending less money, doing more, and doing it quickly, it's worth it!

Learning from others can improve oneself. From introducing second-hand equipment to production is not easy. Tianjin has also paid a painful price in some introduction projects. But in the tide of reform and opening up, they quickly seized the initiative.

Tianjin's teams going abroad are usually experts and decision-makers with the authority to make decisions. They have always paid attention to foreign business, technology, and even tried to understand local tax laws. Therefore, they strive to include "four aspects" in the introduction (hardware, software, intelligence, spare parts) and even include tools, fixtures, and sales channels. The city government's quick information and decision-making are also strong backing. Mayor Li Ruihuan often shares the most information about the international market, products, and technology upon his return from abroad, making people's ears and eyes fresh.

Even the most advanced equipment still needs people to operate and strive. Caring for people, understanding people, and encouraging people's ideological and political work have provided a reliable guarantee for workers to skillfully master the imported production lines.

Workers at the Second Bicycle Factory created a mechanical man for spraying paint on Sprider bicycles. Kenaire people improved the original design of Bouquet-Naix, thickened the insulation layer, and modified the evaporator, saving 9% of materials while increasing the cooling capacity by 15%.

Introducing second-hand equipment is like borrowing a stone to attack a jade. The process of introduction also tests the courage and strength of the Chinese people. Tianjin's dismantling team, without external guidance, independently drew 1,400 design drawings on-site, sorted out 3,000 technical data and tooling drawings, and completed the task that the other party thought the Chinese could not complete a month ahead of schedule. As a result, the local newspaper sighed: Once the Chinese fight for national honor, their efficiency is not inferior to anyone.

### 二手设备的后发力

    二手设备的后发力
    本报记者　肖荻
    今春。莱比锡国际博览会。在强手如林的同类产品中，中国的可耐牌BCD220型电冰箱荣获国际金奖。7月，北京国际博览会。5天内仅香港客户就订货1.8万台，成交额453.2万美元，成为中国冰箱行业的个中翘楚。
    在天津，从国外引进二手设备之后，在短时期内搞出拳头产品，再转身打出去的，除可耐冰箱，还有人们喜欢的斯普瑞克自行车。斯普瑞克以其轻、快、美被认为是“以最简洁的方法生产的现代人最喜欢的车”，去年底在全国轻工产品评比中一举获得科技进步金龙腾飞奖，被天津列为创质量国优的10项拳头产品之一。造型富有时代感、性能优良的迅达牌摩托车，在去年10月一次全国摩托车赛中，获80系列团体赛冠军，并囊括个人赛前三名，亦获金龙腾飞奖。重工业战线也不甘人后。天津市轧钢三厂于1984年6月引进35吨电炉全套二手炼钢设备，投产后顿使自己从生产普碳钢材为主的单一轧钢厂，向以生产优质钢材为主的特殊钢厂迈出新步。
    快节奏，带来事半功倍。1983年3月，当天津捕捉到法国鲍克耐稀公司因破产倒闭，为使用过五年左右的全部设备寻找买主时，立即组团赴法，几经艰苦谈判，用折合340万美元的价格签字成交。这一费用，几乎与广州从日立引进冰箱生产线价格相等，但其年产40万台的生产能力却是日立生产线的4倍！之后，拆运、建厂、安装、调试……到1987年试产4.3万台，实现税利850万元，还出口2000台，创汇60万美元，在我国电冰箱建设史上成为唯一当年大批量投产、当年创利创汇的企业。
    国际商战，瞬息万变。谁能抓住那闪如电光的机遇，谁就是胜者。天津在获悉慕尼黑迅达普公司倒闭拍卖、组团赴联邦德国洽购迅达摩托车全套生产设备时，不仅国内而且国外也有劲敌凯觎，有的还以高价较量，但天津市上上下下工作节拍急如星火。摩托车专家组从接任务到登机，仅用7小时完成签证、购机票、取外汇、备行装……在联邦德国从考察到签字成交仅用了两昼夜。拆装、发运691个集装箱仅用100 天，建4.4万平方米厂房仅用11个月……1988年当年投产，当年破万辆大关。而斯普瑞克自行车生产线则实现了当年引进，当年安装，当年试产，当年见效益。
    效率就是生命。就因为一个快字，一个年产10万辆摩托车的全部设备和软件，被中国天津以比西亚某国出价便宜200万西德马克的价格买到手。而轧钢三厂从引进、施工到炼出钢水，比英国人当初改造该炼钢厂还快一个月，转年已炼出5472吨优质钢。技术进步使这个厂近5年创利税比建厂初期增长了15倍。他们从英国引进这套二手设备的价格，仅为当时国外相应新设备价格的1／4。少花钱，多办事，快办事，划得来！
    他山之石，可以攻玉。从引进二手设备到投产，并非唾手可得。天津在个别引进项目中同样也付出过痛苦的学费。但，在改革、开放的大潮中，他们迅速把握了主动权。
    天津组团出国多是行家里手和有拍板权的决策人。他们一向关注国外商情、技术，甚至还设法弄懂当地税法。正因为如此，他们在引进中力求“四件”俱全（硬件、软件、智力、散件）甚至包括工、卡、量具及销售渠道。而市政府的信息灵、决策快更是强有力的后盾。李瑞环市长每次出国归来吹风最多的就是国际市场、商品、技术信息，使人耳目一新。
    再先进的设备还是要靠人来操作和拚搏。关心人、理解人、鼓励人的思想政治工作，为上岗工人熟练掌握舶来的生产线提供了可靠保证。
    第二自行车厂工人创造出为斯普瑞克车喷漆的机械人，可耐人改进了鲍克耐稀原设计，加厚保温层，改造蒸发器，使材料节约9％，而制冷量增加了15％。
    引进二手设备是借他山之石，在引进过程中也考验了中国人的胆识和力度。天津的拆装组在没有外力指导下，硬是自己现场测绘设计图1400多张，清点技术资料及工装图3000多张，提前一个多月完成对方认为中国人根本完不成的任务，以致当地报纸慨叹：一旦中国人为民族为国家荣誉而战，其效率不比任何人差。
