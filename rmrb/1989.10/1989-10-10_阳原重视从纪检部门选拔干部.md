The Yangyuan County Committee of Hebei Province places great importance on cultivating and selecting officials from the discipline inspection team. They vigorously commend and support discipline inspection officials who adhere to principles and handle matters impartially, thereby effectively promoting the construction of party discipline at the grassroots level.

Wang Bingzhi, the former director of the Discipline Inspection Section of the County Discipline Inspection Commission, diligently handled cases of disciplinary violations during his tenure at the commission. After being transferred to Jingergou Township as the Party Committee Secretary in 1988, he refused bribes four times in construction projects and railway construction, totaling over 2,000 yuan, and was commended by the County Committee. Liang Jilu, the former director of the Letters and Visits Section of the County Discipline Inspection Commission, was transferred to the County Poverty Alleviation Office as the deputy director (in charge of work). He first ensured the implementation of the party discipline responsibility system, establishing a "leadership integrity card." In the management of the county's 3.5 million yuan in poverty alleviation funds, he adhered to the "two public and one supervision" system (publicizing the use of poverty alleviation funds and projects, mobilizing party members and the masses to supervise) and the "three no" principle (no accepting bribes, no extravagance, no personal dealings). He was praised by relevant departments.

In recent years, the County Committee has, on the one hand, assigned some discipline inspection officials to grassroots units; on the other hand, it has continuously supplemented the discipline inspection department with officials who have strong party spirit, are capable, and have practical experience from the military and county-level party and government departments. This ensures that the discipline inspection department always maintains a team of discipline inspection officials with strong party spirit, firm style, and high quality. Currently, the 18 comrades working in the County Discipline Inspection Commission are dedicated and striving forward. At the same time, the work of the commission has not been affected by the transfer of officials. Since 1986, Yangyuan County has been consecutively rated as an advanced county for party discipline construction and discipline inspection and letters and visits work by the Municipal Committee and Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission. In 1987, the County Discipline Inspection Commission was named an advanced unit for discipline inspection work by the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission.

    阳原重视从纪检部门选拔干部
    本报讯　河北省阳原县委十分重视从纪检队伍中培养和选拔干部，大力表彰和支持坚持原则、秉公办事的纪检干部，有力促进了基层单位的党风建设。
    原县纪委纪检科长王秉直在纪委工作期间，认真查处违纪案件，敢于碰硬，1988年调井儿沟乡任党委书记后，在基建包工、铁路建筑等项业务往来中，先后拒贿4次，款额2000多元，受到了县委表彰。原县纪委信访科长梁巨禄调县扶贫办公室任副主任（主持工作）后，首先抓了党风责任制的落实，建立了“领导干部廉洁卡”，在对全县350万元扶贫款使用上坚持“两公开一监督”制度（扶贫款使用公开、扶贫项目公开，发动党员、群众监督）和“三不原则”（不收礼受贿、不铺张浪费、不搞人情交易），受到有关部门赞扬。
    近年来，县委一方面把部分纪检干部选派到基层单位任职；另一方面又经常不断把一些党性观念强、有能力、有实践经验的部队转业干部、县直党政干部充实到纪检部门工作，使纪检部门始终保持一支党性强、作风硬、素质高的纪检干部队伍。目前，在县纪委工作的18名同志，工作安心，奋发向上。同时，纪委的工作也没有因为干部调动受到影响。1986年以来，阳原县连续被地委、地纪委评为党风建设先进县、纪检信访工作先进县。1987年县纪委还被省纪委命名为纪检工作先进单位。
