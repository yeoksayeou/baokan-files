The World Judo Championships opened today at 10 AM in the Youth Sports Hall in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. More than 500 male and female athletes from 65 countries will compete for 16 gold medals over the next six days.

In the first event, the women's 72 kg+ category, more than 20 athletes participated. Gao Fenglian, a multiple-time world champion from China, dominated the competition, defeating strong opponents from Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union to secure the first place in Group A. She will compete against the first-place finisher from Group B tonight for the championship.

Local experts believe that this championship not only sets a record for the number of participants but also promises intense competition. With 50 athletes who have won medals in previous major tournaments in Essen and Seoul, the level of competition is expected to be unprecedented. As women's judo will be an official event starting from the next Olympic Games, each country has sent their strongest teams to showcase their strength.

The Japanese team, which won three gold medals in the 1987 Essen tournament, had a disappointing performance in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, winning only one gold medal. They aim to regain their form and win four gold medals in this competition. The U.S. team has three female athletes who have won world championships, making them one of China's strongest opponents. The Japanese team is reportedly most concerned about the Soviet team. The Soviet men's team has two former world champions, and although the women's team is participating in a major international competition for the first time, they are well-coordinated, with excellent physical conditions and qualities. A judo expert described them as a formidable "dark horse" that could surprise everyone.

Chinese team coach Liu Yuqi told reporters that only a few athletes in the Chinese team, such as Li Zhongyun, Gao Fenglian, and Liu Guizhu, have won championships and runner-up titles in previous major tournaments. They will strive to leverage their advantages and defend their titles. The rest of the team members are mostly first-time international competitors. They are prepared to make a bold attempt and gain experience through fierce competition.

    世界柔道锦标赛开幕
    高凤莲一路过关斩将取得决赛权
    本报贝尔格莱德10月10日电　记者严正报道：1989年世界柔道锦标赛今天上午10时在南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德的少年体育馆拉开战幕。来自65个国家的500多位男女力士将为争夺16块金牌而鏖战6天。
    在今天开始的第一个项目女子72公斤以上级比赛中，有20多位运动员参加角逐。我国数次世界冠军获得者高凤莲以绝对优势，先后战胜保加利亚、英国和苏联的强手，获A组第一名。她将于今天晚上与B组第一名争夺冠军。
    此间行家认为，这次锦标赛不但参加人数之多创了历史纪录，其中50位运动员在埃森和汉城世界大赛中获得过奖牌，而且争斗的激烈程度也将是空前的。由于从下届奥运会起女子柔道也将列为正式比赛项目，因此各国都派出了最强阵容，以显示实力。
      日本队在1987年的埃森大赛中曾获得3块金牌，可是在去年汉城奥运会比赛中战绩不佳，仅获得一块金牌。他们打算在此次比赛中重振雄风，夺取4块金牌。美国队中有3名女运动员曾获得过世界比赛金牌，她们是中国女队最强的对手之一。据说日本队最担心的是苏联队。苏联男队员中有两位是前世界冠军，女运动员虽首次参加大型国际比赛，但队伍整齐，身体条件和素质都很好。有位柔道专家称她们是不可小视的“黑马”，不鸣则已，一鸣惊人。
    中国队教练刘玉琪对记者说，在中国队中，只有李忠云、高凤莲和刘桂珠等几位在过去的世界大赛中获得过冠亚军，她们将努力发挥优势，力争打胜卫冕战。其余绝大多数是首次出国参赛的新手，他们准备勇猛地“冲击一下”，在苦斗中取得经验。
