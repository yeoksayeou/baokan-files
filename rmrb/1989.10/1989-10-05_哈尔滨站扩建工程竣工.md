Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 3rd.

The expansion project of Harbin Railway Station has been completed and put into use.

Harbin Railway Station is the junction of the Harbin-Dalian, Harbin-Zunhua, Harbin-Benxi, Harbin-Suifenhe, and Harbin-Labin railway lines. It handles 195 train departures and arrivals daily, with an average of 107,000 passengers boarding and alighting each day. With the economic boom, the station building, constructed in 1899, can no longer meet the needs. In June 1988, the station expansion project began. The new station building has a total area of 27,998 square meters, including the central main building, five waiting halls, and special waiting rooms for mothers with infants, military personnel, and VIPs with soft seats, as well as skybridges, substations, and communication broadcasting facilities. It can accommodate 50,000 passengers daily, doubling the waiting area compared to before.

    哈尔滨站扩建工程竣工
    新华社哈尔滨十月三日电（通讯员刘英贵、记者吴晓东）哈尔滨火车站站舍扩建工程日前竣工，并交付使用。
    哈尔滨火车站是哈大、滨洲、滨北、滨绥和拉滨五条铁路干线的交汇点，每日接发列车一百九十五对，日均上下车旅客达十点七万人次。随着经济的繁荣发展，这个建于一八九九年的车站站舍已不能适应需要。一九八八年六月，车站扩建工程破土动工。新站舍总建筑面积二万七千九百九十八平方米，包括中央主楼、五个候车厅和母婴、军人、贵宾软席三个候车室，及天桥、变电亭、通讯广播等配套设施，每日可容纳旅客五万人次，候车面积比以前增加一倍多。
