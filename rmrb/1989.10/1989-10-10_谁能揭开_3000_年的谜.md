The Iraqi government is currently actively preparing to restore the ancient city of Mesopotamia. One of the ancient sites to be restored is the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Legend has it that this garden was built 3,000 years ago by King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon to please his ailing queen. The garden had seven levels and was 110 meters high, and it was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. However, the problem of irrigation in such a structure under the technological conditions of that time remains a mystery to this day.

Recently, President Saddam Hussein offered a substantial reward to solicit designs. Anyone who can propose the most logical concept will receive a prize of $1.5 million. According to the president's conditions, only Iraqi citizens are eligible to participate in the design competition. Furthermore, the irrigation system design must use tools from the 6th century BC.

An Iraqi Ministry of Information spokesperson said the purpose of this competition is to let the world know about Iraq's ancient civilization. According to reports, dozens of Iraqi engineers and architects have already submitted irrigation concepts. The evaluation of these plans will be conducted by Iraqi archaeologists, and the best plan will be applied to the restoration project of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

    谁能揭开3000年的谜
    目前，伊拉克政府正在积极筹备修复古城美索不达米亚，待修复的城市古迹之一是著名的巴比伦空中花园。相传，这个花园是3000年前巴比伦国王尼布甲尼撒二世，为了博得多病的皇后的欢心而建造的。花园有七层、离地面110米，被称为古希腊七大奇迹之一。但在当时的技术条件下，花园的灌溉问题是如何解决的，至今还是个谜。
    不久前，侯赛因总统悬赏重金，征集设计，谁能提出最合乎逻辑的构想，将获得150万美元的奖金。根据总统提出的条件，只有伊拉克公民有权参加设计竞赛，其次，灌溉系统的方案必须采用公元前6世纪的原始工具。
    伊拉克新闻部发言人说，开展这场竞赛的目的是让世人了解伊拉克的悠久文明。据报道，伊拉克已有数十名工程师、建筑师提出了灌溉构想，方案评定将由伊拉克的考古学家们负责，最佳方案将应用到巴比伦空中花园的修复工程中。　（世绍）
