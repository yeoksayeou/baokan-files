On February 19, 1986, at the three-level cadre meeting in Yueyang County, Hunan Province, Yueyang County Committee Secretary Huang Jiefu stood before more than 2,000 cadres and declared without hesitation: "In rectifying party style, not using power for personal gain, and serving the people with concrete actions, the leaders of each district and township, and each unit must set an example. All levels of party organizations in the county should align with the county committee, and the committee members should align with me!"

"Align with me!" The words were firm and resolute, startling the audience, and the hall erupted in thunderous applause.

Huang Jiefu was well aware of what proposing "align with me" meant and the possible reactions and consequences it might bring. However, to demonstrate his resolve against corruption, he believed he had only one choice: to step forward and set an example.

In Yueyang County, Huang Jiefu was famous for riding a bicycle.

For 365 days a year, except when on official business or attending meetings, he spent most of his time in the grassroots. When going to the grassroots, he often rode a bicycle. If the bicycle couldn't reach a place, he would walk.

There were mixed opinions about Huang Jiefu riding a bicycle to the grassroots. Among the criticisms, two views were particularly representative. One said: Now is the era of a commodity economy, emphasizing openness and horizontal connections. The county leaders keep running to the grassroots, what good can come from that? Another said: Since there are cars, why ride a bicycle? Four wheels are faster than two, isn't it about time consciousness and work efficiency?

In fact, Huang Jiefu was not indifferent to openness and horizontal connections. He had personally gone to the most open province of Guangdong to broaden his horizons and had sent people to Wenzhou to see the world. He also sincerely invited talents from all over the country to revitalize Yueyang. However, he believed that as a county committee secretary, his focus should be on the county, and his main task was to creatively implement the party's line, principles, and policies in accordance with the county's actual situation, develop productive forces, cultivate "four-haves" new people, and grasp the construction of the two civilizations. This required frequent visits to the grassroots, investigations, and research, and maintaining close contact with the people. The places that needed their attention the most were often where cars couldn't reach. Therefore, despite the criticisms, he still often rode his bicycle on the bumpy rural roads.

In people's minds, this bicycle, which was not only overloaded but also overdue for retirement, had become a testament to Huang Jiefu's perseverance in hard work. The influence it radiated had a subtle effect on both the internal and external members of the leadership team. During the time when various government agencies were competing to buy luxury cars, the Yueyang County Committee made the decision to "walk with both feet, go to the countryside and factories." This news, published in the Hunan Daily, vividly demonstrated this influence.

However, what people were most concerned about was not the bicycle under Huang Jiefu's saddle but the power in his hands.

Huang Jiefu was keenly aware of this and maintained a high degree of vigilance in this regard, demanding much of himself. Some insiders commented that he was sometimes too strict to the point of being inhumane.

His two sons got married one after the other, both in a state of secrecy, without informing the county committee office to avoid others coming to send gifts.

His father and father-in-law passed away in the countryside one after the other, and he instructed the county committee office staff to seal the news, not letting the county's offices and departments know. He also reminded the three-level officials of the district, township, and village: keep the funeral simple and do not come to pay respects.

His younger brother originally worked as a private teacher in the countryside. His elderly mother wanted him, as the elder brother, to help a bit and transfer his younger brother to a public school position, eating the "state grain." He firmly refused. His wife, Liang Yingbao, originally a section-level cadre in a city's organizational department, was transferred to Hongjiawan. He did not agree to arrange her to be the director of the county personnel bureau. His "rule" was: as the county's main leader, his wife should not be placed in a key department or be the head of a department. Everyone had to respect his opinion and let Liang Yingbao take a deputy position in another department.

For his family members, the power in his hands was not a means to obtain money, materials, privileges, backdoors, or enjoyment, but a constraint. Everyone wanted to contribute more to their hometown, but it was not easy to be the main leader in their hometown. Once you become an "official," relatives and friends, even those who are remotely related, would naturally come knocking on your door to solve this or that problem. Huang Jiefu and Liang Yingbao set a rule: each would handle their own relatives and friends' matters, everything would be handled according to principles and policies, and no "backdoors" would be opened. Because of this rule, some relatives and friends who came to seek favors left with smiles on their faces but anger in their hearts, and some even cursed him for being "ungrateful" after becoming an official.

When Huang Jiefu was studying at Lingyun Primary School in his hometown, because his family was too poor to pay tuition, his father, who worked as a hired laborer, was so anxious that he kept saying, "Don't go to school anymore..." In desperation, a teacher from the village who ran a private school said in an authoritative tone, "Jiefu cannot drop out of school. This child is exceptionally talented and has a bright future!" He immediately helped out with money. His parents were grateful and instructed him to repay the favor someday. Decades passed, many childhood memories had faded, but Huang Jiefu and his family never forgot the kindness of this teacher.

One day, he opened a letter from the masses, and the handwriting of this benefactor appeared before his eyes, requesting help to solve his daughter's household registration problem. It was still the same authoritative tone: "I am about to die. I have never asked you for anything before. This matter, you must do it!" This was an opportunity to repay the favor, but he could not use this opportunity because such a rural-to-urban transfer violated the policy, and he could not meet the benefactor's request. After deep thought, he respectfully wrote a letter to the benefactor, expressing his eternal gratitude for the past kindness and his deep regret for this matter. A few days later, he also asked his wife to write a long letter to comfort and seek understanding.

In his hometown, Huang Jiefu had accumulated debt after debt of gratitude.

Huang Jiefu had no smoking habit, no drinking habit, no gambling habit, only a book habit. He read widely, covering politics, economics, history, philosophy, literature, psychology, and other fields. He paid special attention to and liked to read books about leadership science, behavioral science, and new trends and technological revolutions. He usually strictly refused to accept various gifts, but he opened the green light for books. Many Yueyang people working outside the province knew of his book habit and often sent him newly published books. Over the past few years, he had read enough books and magazines to fill two cabinets.

In Huang Jiefu's daily schedule, reading and learning were as important as handling letters from the masses.

The office staff made a rough estimate that by the end of last year, in less than three years, he had received more than 4,820 letters from the masses and personally replied to more than a thousand letters.

Over the years, he had selected more than a hundred "petitioners" from the letters from the masses to serve as advisory members.

Various letters from the masses both supervised and encouraged Huang Jiefu.

In January 1989, Huang Jiefu was awarded the honorary title of "National Excellent Young Ideological Educator" by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League; in July of this year, he was awarded the honorary title of "Excellent Party Affairs Worker" by the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

In the same year, in March, Yueyang County was awarded the honorary title of "Advanced County in Civilized Unit Construction" by the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government.

    “向我看齐”
    ——记湖南岳阳县委书记黄甲喜
    金希光　吴又珠　陶小爱
    1986年2月19日，在湖南省岳阳县三级干部大会上，岳阳县委书记黄甲喜面对两千多名国家干部，毫不含糊地提出：“在端正党风、不以权谋私和为人民办实事这几点上，各区乡、各单位的负责人要当表率，全县各级党组织向县委常委看齐，常委同志向我看齐！”
    “向我看齐！”掷地有声，语惊四座，会场爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。
    黄甲喜不会不晓得提出“向我看齐”意味着什么以及可能引起的反应和带来的后果。但是，为了表明反腐败的决心，他认为自己只能有一种选择：挺身而出作表率。
    在岳阳县，黄甲喜骑单车是出了名的。
    一年365天，除了出差、开会，大部分时间他是在基层转。下基层，不少时候是骑单车。单车去不得的地方，就走着去。
    对黄甲喜骑单车深入基层，上下左右褒贬不一。在贬议中，有两说颇有代表性。一曰：如今是商品经济时代，讲对外开放，横向联系，县里当头头的老往下面跑，能跑出什么名堂来？二曰：既然有小车，何必踩单车，四个轮子总比两个轮子快，不是要讲时间观念和工作效率么？　　其实，黄甲喜对开放和横向联系并非不重视，他本人就到最开放的广东去开过眼界，也派人到温州去见过世面，还以广罗人才的至诚，为振兴岳阳恭请四方名士。但他认为，作为县委书记，立足点应放在本县，主要任务是结合本县实际创造性地贯彻党的路线、方针和政策，发展社会生产力，培养“四有”新人，把两个文明建设抓好。这就需要经常深入基层，调查研究，同人民群众保持密切联系。那些最需要我们去的基层，往往是汽车进不去的地方。所以，尽管有人非议，他还是经常踩着单车在崎岖不平的乡村小路上奔波。　　在人们的心目中，这辆不仅超负荷运转而且超期服役的单车，已成为黄甲喜坚持艰苦奋斗作风的见证。它辐射出的感召力，对班子内外起着潜移默化的作用。在一些党政机关竞相购买高档小车的“豪华热”时，岳阳县委却作出了“迈开双脚，下乡下厂”的决定。这条发表在湖南日报上的新闻，生动地显示出这种感召力。
    但人们最为关注的，还不是黄甲喜胯下的单车，而是他手中的权力。
    黄甲喜清醒地意识到这一点，在这一点上保持着高度警觉，对自己要求严格。一些知情者评论，他有时严得有点不近人情。
    他的两个儿子先后结婚，都是在保密状态下办的喜事，没有惊动县委机关，以免别人上门送礼。
    他的父亲和岳父先后在乡下去世，他都叮嘱县委办公室的同志封锁消息，不让县里的机关、部门知道。并给当地的区、乡、村三级干部打招呼：丧事从简，切勿上门吊孝。
    他的胞弟原来在农村当民办教师，老母亲要他这个当老兄的帮点忙，把老弟转为公办教师，吃上
  “皇粮”，他坚决不答应。他的妻子梁英保原来是某市委组织部的一名正科级干部，调来荣家湾时，打算安排到县人事局当局长，他不同意。他的“框框”是：自己是县里的主要领导，爱人就不要安置到要害部门，也不要当部门的一把手。大家只好尊重他的意见，让梁英保到另一个部门担任副职。
    对于他的家属来说，他手中的权力，不是意味着金钱、物资、优待、后门、享受，而是一种约束。人们都愿为家乡多做些贡献，但在家乡当主要领导却不容易。你当了“官”，亲戚朋友乃至曲里拐弯的亲戚朋友，自然会寻上门来要你解决这样那样的问题。黄甲喜和梁英保定了一条“君子协定”：各自把各自亲戚朋友的关，一切按原则和政策办事，绝不开“后门”。由于坚持了这一条，上门求情的亲戚朋友有的满面春风进屋，满脸怨气出门，有的还骂他“当了官，六亲不认”。
    黄甲喜在家乡的凌云小学读书时，因为家里太穷，交不起学费，做长工的父亲急得团团转，连声说：“莫读算了……”绝望中，村里一位教私塾的先生用一种权威的口气说：“甲喜不能辍学，这孩子天资过人，前途无量！”当即解囊相助。他父母感谢不尽，叮嘱他日后一定要报答。几十年过去了，童年的事好多淡忘了，可对这位先生的恩情黄甲喜和他的家人一直没有忘。
    一天，他拆阅群众来信，这位恩人的手札赫然出现在眼前，要求帮助解决他女儿的户口问题。还是当年那种权威的口气：“我行将就木矣，过去从未向你提过任何要求，这件事，你一定要办到！”这是报答的好机会，然而他却不能利用这个机会，因为这种农转非违犯政策，他无法满足恩人的要求。沉思良久，他毕恭毕敬地给恩人回了封信，表达了对前恩没齿难忘之情和对此事深为抱歉之意。几天后，又请老伴写了封长信寄去，进行抚慰和祈求谅解。
    在家乡这块土地上，黄甲喜欠下了一笔又一笔人情债。
    黄甲喜一无烟瘾，二无酒瘾，三无牌瘾，只有书瘾。他阅读的范围很广，政治、经济、历史、哲学、文学、心理学等各个方面的书籍，都有兴趣涉猎。特别注重和喜欢看的，是有关领导科学、行为科学和新思潮、新技术革命方面的著作。他平时严格拒收各种财礼，唯独对书开放绿灯。不少在外地工作的岳阳籍人士晓得他书瘾重，常给他寄一些刚刚出版的新书。近几年来，他看过的书刊足足装了两柜子。
    在黄甲喜的生活日程上，同看书学习并重的，是处理群众来信。
    办公室的同志作了粗略统计，到去年底为止，在不到3年的时间里，他共收到群众来信4820多件，亲笔回信上千封。
    这几年，他从群众来信中物色对象，聘请了上百名“上书言事”的议政员。
    各式各样的群众来信，对黄甲喜既起监督作用，又起鞭策作用。
    1989年元月，黄甲喜被中宣部、团中央授予“全国优秀青年思想教育工作者”的光荣称号；今年“七一”，他被中共湖南省委授予“优秀党务工作者”的光荣称号。
    同年3月，岳阳县被省委、省政府授予“文明单位建设先进县”的光荣称号。
