For Your and Your Family's Happiness

Roads for vehicles, paths for pedestrians, each to their own. Yet, there are indeed people who disregard these traffic safety rules, dodging and climbing onto trains, rushing across crossings, sitting or lying on tracks, walking on embankments, daring to challenge the speed of trains. Look at the photos taken by readers on the spot published here; it truly makes one worry for those "adventurers"—they are playing with their own lives!

According to statistics from the railway department, in recent years, accidents causing injuries and deaths outside railway tracks have become increasingly severe. Each year, there are over ten thousand such incidents, with an average of dozens of people injured or killed daily, and nearly one person dying every hour. Each year, thousands of various types of vehicles are damaged. The peaceful and happy family life of people, and the normal and orderly operation of the economy in society, are disrupted in an instant by these accidents, bringing pain to families and society, and causing losses to the nation and collective.

Those who violate railway transportation safety regulations, aside from children who are unaware, are mostly doing so knowingly. Analyzing their psychological state, there are generally three types: first, relying on luck, "just this one time, nothing will happen"; second, attempting to gain an advantage, "rush to catch a convenient ride, no one will check"; third, seeking convenience, "since the train hasn't come yet, it's safe to cross."

Railway safety outside tracks is part of social security. We hope that everyone, especially those living along railway lines, will consciously maintain railway traffic safety. For your and your family's happiness, do not dare to challenge the speeding trains.

### 为了您和您家庭的幸福

    为了您和您家庭的幸福
    车行道，人行道，各行其道。可是，居然就有人无视这交通安全规则，钻车扒车、抢越道口、坐卧钢轨、行走路基，欲与火车“试比高”。看看这里发表的读者从现场抓拍来的镜头，真让人替那些“冒险者”捏一把汗——拿自己的生命开玩笑！
    据铁道部门统计，近年来，造成铁路行车路外伤亡事故日趋严重，每年发生一万余起，平均每天伤亡几十人，不到一小时就有一人丧生。每年损失各种交通车辆达数千辆。人们平静而幸福的家庭生活，社会上正常而有秩序的经济运行，就在这一瞬间的事故中失去平衡，给家庭、社会带来痛苦，给国家、集体造成损失。
    那些违反铁路运输安全规定的人，除了儿童不懂事外，基本上都是明知故犯。分析起心理状态来，不外乎有三：一是出于侥幸，“偶而一次，不会出事”；二是企图沾光，“抢搭顺路车，无人查看”；三是图个方便，“反正火车没过来，闯过去没事”。
    铁路路外安全是社会治安的一部分，望大家尤其是铁路沿线的群众，自觉维护铁路交通安全。为了您和您家庭的幸福，切不要与飞奔的列车“争高低”。
