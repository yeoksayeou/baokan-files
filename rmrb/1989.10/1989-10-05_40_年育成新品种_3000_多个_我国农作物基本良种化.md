    3,000 New Varieties Developed in 40 Years: China's Crops Achieve Basic Seed Improvement
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 4th (reporters Lü Yǒngjiàn, correspondent Chén Liángyù) — “A good crop starts with good seeds,” after 40 years of unremitting efforts, China's crops have basically achieved seed improvement. According to the latest statistics, this year China's crop seed coverage rate has reached over 80%.

    In the year 1949, when everything was in ruins, the coverage area of improved seeds for major crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton in the entire country was only 10 million mu, which was about one-sixth of the total crop planting area at that time. In 1988, China promoted 1,234 improved crop varieties, and among these, the coverage area of just 30 varieties reached 12.5 billion mu. This year, the promotion of hybrid rice alone reached nearly 2 billion mu.

    In these 40 years of tremendous change, agricultural science and technology personnel have actively carried out the selection, demonstration, and promotion of improved seeds, making excellent varieties continuously emerge, and the coverage area rapidly expand. By 1988, the country had cumulatively developed over 3,000 new crop varieties, of which over 2,500 have been promoted and applied in large-scale field production. There are over 300 varieties with an application area of over 10 million mu.

    40年育成新品种3000多个
    我国农作物基本良种化
    据新华社北京10月4日电（记者鹿永建、通讯员陈良玉）“庄稼一枝花，全靠种当家”，经过40年不懈努力，我国农作物已基本实现良种化。据最新统计，今年我国农作物良种覆盖率达80％以上。
    百废待兴的1949年，全中国水稻、小麦、棉花等主要农作物良种覆盖面积仅1000万亩，是当时农作物播种面积的万分之六左右。1988年，我国推广农作物优良品种1234个，仅其中30种的统计，良种覆盖面积已12.5亿亩，今年，杂交水稻一项就推广了近两亿亩。
    在这翻天覆地的40年里，广大农业科技人员积极开展良种的选育、示范和推广，使优良品种不断涌现，覆盖面积迅速扩大，到1988年，全国累计育成农作物新品种3000多个，其中2500多个在大田生产上推广应用，应用面积在100万亩以上的就有300多个。
