The anti-corruption campaign is real. Those who persist in wrongdoing will be punished. The Secretary of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee, Zhuang Hongze, has been arrested. The Director of the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Xu Jun, has been captured.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 26th - Reporter Gao Haihao reports: The Secretary of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee, Zhuang Hongze, abused his power to accept bribes. After the case was exposed, he refused to surrender and confess. Yesterday, he was arrested by the procuratorial authorities in accordance with the law.

It is understood that in early May this year, Zhuang Hongze, through his secretary, accepted a stock certificate worth 5,000 yuan from the manager of a township enterprise. In September, this manager, intimidated by the power of the "two courts" (the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate), surrendered to the procuratorial authorities and confessed his economic crimes, also disclosing the bribery to Zhuang Hongze. The procuratorial authorities of Zhejiang Province and Jiaxing City immediately initiated an investigation and obtained a large amount of evidence, confirming that Zhuang Hongze had indeed accepted bribes.

In the more than a month since the case was exposed, the leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee had more than 10 conversations with Zhuang Hongze, and the procuratorial authorities also repeatedly propagated the spirit of the "Notice" issued by the two courts, urging him to thoroughly confess and admit his crimes to seek lenient treatment. However, Zhuang Hongze remained obstinate, continuing to conceal the facts of his crimes and making excuses for himself.

Last night, while arresting Zhuang Hongze, the procuratorial authorities of Zhejiang Province also conducted a legal search of Zhuang's residence and seized a batch of illicit items.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th - Reporter Yan Shiguang reports: Beijing City held a meeting today to crack down on economic crimes and implement a lenient and severe policy. The former Director of the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Xu Jun, former Deputy Director Jia Shuang, Assistant Director (Deputy Director level) Wei Guofan, and Deputy Director of the Dispatching Office (Deputy Director level treatment) Ma Mingshan, who demanded and accepted huge bribes, refused to surrender, and were arrested on the spot at the meeting in accordance with the law.

Xu Jun and others abused their power to approve car plan quotas for relevant units and individuals, demanding and accepting huge bribes and a large number of items. After being investigated by relevant departments, they even formed an alliance to resist the investigation and cover up their crimes. After the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Supreme People's Court issued the "Notice," they continued to resist. The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate decided to arrest these four criminals and further investigate the case.

Also announced at the meeting today to be severely punished in accordance with the law were Zhang Xihong, former Deputy Director of the Civil Engineering Department of the China International Engineering Consulting Corporation and General Manager of the Overseas Engineering Development Co., Ltd. (Deputy Director level), who accepted bribes from Hong Kong businessman Wu totaling 74,900 yuan and embezzled public funds totaling 5,900 yuan; Cui Yi, an official of the Second Business Department of the Beijing Customs, who accepted bribes from a Hong Kong businessman totaling 45,000 yuan in RMB, 1,300 USD, and 6,000 HKD; and Ma Xiong, a farmer from Shilou Township, Fangshan District, Beijing, who operates an individual construction business and bribed a state official with 100,000 yuan. The Municipal Procuratorate has already filed public prosecutions against the above three criminals.

Yan Jianguang, a worker from the Experimental Factory of the Scientific Research Institute of the former Ministry of Railways, forged entry procedures with others, forged official seals, printed, altered, and tampered with "Customs Passenger Luggage Declaration Forms," smuggled duty-free foreign exchange goods, evaded customs duties totaling 934,000 yuan, and then resold them for illegal profits totaling 552,000 yuan. The Beijing Intermediate People's Court sentenced the smugglers Yan Jianguang to death and deprived him of political rights for life.

Yao Shanyi, a retired cadre from the Luanping County Power Bureau of Chengde Region, Hebei Province, during his tenure as a consultant for the Information Consulting Department of Beijing San Yue Service Company and the director of the Joint Office of Beijing Broadcasting Technology Research Institute, embezzled public funds totaling 395,000 yuan. He should have been sentenced to death and executed immediately, but considering that Yao confessed to all his crimes truthfully after his arrest and actively returned the illicit gains, the Intermediate People's Court of Beijing, in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law of China and the spirit of the "Notice" issued by the two courts, sentenced the embezzler Yao Shanyi to death, suspended for two years, and deprived him of political rights for life. The embezzlers Liu Dashun and Sun Zhengjian, who were announced to have received lenient treatment at today's meeting, were released on the spot.

　　反腐治贪动真的  执迷不悟被惩处
　　嘉兴市委书记庄洪泽被逮捕
    铁道部运输局局长徐俊落网
    本报杭州10月26日电　记者高海浩报道：浙江省嘉兴市委书记庄洪泽利用职权，收受贿赂，案发后拒不自首交代，昨天被检察机关依法逮捕。
    据悉，今年5月初，嘉兴市委书记庄洪泽通过他的秘书，收受某乡镇企业厂长的一张面值5000元的集资股票。今年9月，这位厂长慑于“两院”通告的威力，向检察机关投案自首，坦白自己的经济犯罪问题，还交代了向庄洪泽行贿一事。浙江省和嘉兴市检察机关立即立案侦查，获取了大量证据，证实庄洪泽确有受贿行为。
    在案发后一个多月的时间里，浙江省委领导10多次找庄洪泽谈话，检察机关也多次向他宣传两院《通告》的精神，敦促他彻底坦白交代自己的罪行，争取从宽处理。但庄洪泽仍执迷不悟，继续隐瞒犯罪事实，为自己辩解。
    昨天晚上，浙江省检察机关在逮捕庄洪泽的同时，依法搜查了庄的住所，查获一批赃物。
    本报北京10月26日讯　记者颜世贵报道：北京市今天召开打击经济犯罪、兑现宽严政策大会。原铁道部运输局局长徐俊、副局长贾霜、局长助理（副局级）魏国范、调度处副处长（副局级待遇）马鸣山等，索取和收受巨额贿赂，拒不投案自首，在大会上被当场依法逮捕。
    徐俊等人利用职权，为有关单位和个人审批车皮计划提供方便，从中索取和收受巨额贿赂及大量物品。他们在被有关部门审查后，竟订立攻守同盟，对抗审查，极力掩盖所犯罪行。在最高人民检察院和最高人民法院发布《通告》之后，仍继续顽抗。北京市人民检察院分院决定将这四名案犯予以逮捕，并对此案作进一步侦查。
    在今天大会上宣布依法从严处理的还有收受港商吴某贿赂7.49万余元、贪污公款5900余元的原中国国际工程咨询公司民用项目部副主任兼海外工程发展有限公司总经理（副局级）张锡鸿，收受香港商人贿赂人民币4.5万余元、美元1300余元和港币6000余元的北京海关业务二处干部崔屹，向国家工作人员行贿10万余元人民币的北京市房山区石楼乡经营个体建筑的农民马雄。市检察院分院已对以上3名案犯提起公诉。
    原铁道部科学研究院实验工厂工人阎建国伙同他人伪造入境手续，私刻公章，私印、变造和涂改“海关旅客行李申报单”，骗购免税外汇商品，偷逃关税93.4万余元，然后进行倒卖，非法牟利达人民币55.2万余元。北京市中级人民法院依法判处走私犯阎建国死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
    原河北省承德地区滦平县电力局退休干部姚善贻在受聘担任北京三月服务公司信息咨询部顾问兼北京市广播技术研究所联建办公室主任期间，利用职务之便，侵吞公款39.5万余元。本应判处其死刑，立即执行，但鉴于姚犯在被捕后，能如实坦白全部罪行，积极退赃，市中级人民法院根据我国《刑法》规定和两高《通告》精神，判处贪污犯姚善贻死刑，缓期两年执行，剥夺政治权利终身。在今天的大会上宣布受到从轻处理的贪污犯刘大春、孙正建，被当场释放。
