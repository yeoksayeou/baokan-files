The Man and the Biosphere Program in China is in action!

	• The Bawangling Project, based on the situation in Hainan Island where tropical rainforests have been significantly reduced due to long-term deforestation and rubber planting, starts with understanding the baseline of the Bawangling primitive humid tropical evergreen forest area, which is rich in species diversity and complex in structure. The project studies the gradient changes from natural ecosystems to artificial ecosystems.

	• The Xiaoliang Project, on the other hand, focuses on the degraded ecosystem of Xiaoliang in the coastal area of Taishan County, Guangdong Province. It studies how to restore the tropical forest ecosystem from severely eroded bare land by artificially planting pioneer plant species.

	• The Chaohu Pollution Research analyzes the impact of industrial pollution from Hefei City, Anhui Province, on the lake area, clarifies the eutrophication process, and studies the relationship between algal growth and environmental factors. It identifies, quantifies, and understands the interference of pollutants in the lake on the aquatic ecosystem to propose measures for improving water quality and reducing pollution levels.

	• The Ecological Study of Tianjin's Urban Development takes densely populated cities as the object of study. It researches the functions of urban ecosystems, analyzes the interactions and interdependencies among various components of the urban system, and establishes a "sensitivity model" to provide decision-making tools for planners and managers involved in urban development planning.

The Man and the Biosphere Program exists not only in China but also in other countries around the world, all seeking the same answer: Why do people, while enjoying the wealth they have gained and created, often face various punishments from nature? In the process of soil erosion, desertification, deforestation, and increasing species extinction, as well as environmental pollution leading to ecosystem degradation, humans have realized that while they can land on the moon and build nuclear weapons, they have not yet truly unraveled the secrets between humans and the biosphere. There is still a lack of understanding of how human production and economic behavior should coordinate and adapt with the environment.

Perhaps for this reason, the United Nations, in response to the increasingly severe global challenges of population, resources, and the environment, initiated the Man and the Biosphere Program with the aim of protecting the Earth's environment, which is essential for human survival. This loose intergovernmental scientific program, which began in 1971, has since been implemented in more than 100 countries and regions, conducting thousands of field research projects and training activities involving tens of thousands of people.

As one of the member countries of this program, China has been participating with great enthusiasm since 1972. The State Council formally approved the establishment of the corresponding implementation organization, the Chinese National Committee for the Man and the Biosphere Program, in 1978. To date, 37 related projects across the country have been included in the Chinese Man and the Biosphere Program, and 6 national-level nature reserves have been approved to join the international biosphere reserve network. The Man and the Biosphere Program has become a bond connecting experts and scholars from over a hundred countries and regions across regions and national borders, using ecological methods to study the relationship between humans and the environment. It has become a window for providing multidisciplinary and multi-field bases for the rational use and protection of biosphere resources.

The temperate forest ecosystem research program implemented in Changbai Mountain in China can be seen as a microcosm of this bond and window.

The "forest death" is like a ghost threatening the economically developed countries of Europe and America. This is a fact recorded in the European forest damage card: "forest death" is spreading in the Federal Republic of Germany, in Switzerland... According to a rough estimate of artificial forests in 15 European countries by the end of 1985, at least 7 million hectares have suffered this disaster.

In the similarly latitudinal region of Changbai Mountain in Jilin Province, China, there is a forest area of over 200,000 hectares that has not undergone significant vegetation interference since 1702. From the bare rock and snow-capped mountain peaks to the mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forests at the foot of the mountain, the vertical zonation of vegetation is very distinct, without any human interference, forming a complete Northeast Asian mountain ecosystem created by nature. There are no forest pests and diseases, and numerous species coexist in the best form of harmony and coordination.

Is the decline of European artificial forests caused by atmospheric pollutants or natural influences? Despite extensive research on the symptoms of "forest death," scientific opinions differ. In contrast, the optimized forest structure of Changbai Mountain is the best reference model for Europe's diseased forests. The primeval forest of Changbai Mountain, which is at the climax stage, how do the more than 500 species of animals and 1,200 species of plants form a complex food chain, carry out orderly material exchange and energy flow, and maintain ecological balance? Foreign experts hope to gain inspiration from the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, a typical mountain ecosystem in the northern hemisphere of the Eurasian continent, to clarify the causes of "forest death" in Europe and America and formulate effective control strategies; Chinese experts hope to uncover more secrets of nature through the study of the optimized structure, function, and productivity of the ecosystem, to find a forestry path suitable for China. The hopes of experts from both countries have become the basis for international cooperation and exchange.

The Man and the Biosphere Program in China has provided conditions for such cooperation and exchange. It is reported that in the past two years, China has obtained more than $3 million in funding through this window in the form of trust funds, among other means, and has launched more than a dozen ecological and environmental cooperation research projects, providing scientific bases for the rational use and protection of biosphere resources in China and abroad.

    人与生物圈计划在中国

    中国人与生物圈计划在行动！
    ——霸王岭计划，根据海南岛多年毁林种胶、现存热带雨林不多的情况，从了解物种多样、结构复杂的霸王岭原始湿热带常绿森林区本底入手，研究从自然生态系统到人工生态系统的梯度变化。
    ——小良课题则与霸王岭计划相反，它研究的对象是生态系统已经退化了的广东省西部电白县沿海小良地区，怎样由土壤严重侵蚀的裸地，从人工栽植单个先锋植物种开始，恢复热带森林生态系统。
    ——巢湖污染研究，分析安徽合肥市工业污染对湖区的影响，弄清富营养化过程，研究藻类生长同环境因子间的关系。区分、定量及认识湖中污染物对水生生态系统的干扰，以提出改良水质和降低污染程度的措施。
    ——天津城市发展的生态研究，是以人口密集的都市为对象，研究城市生态系统功能，剖析城区系统各组分间相互作用及相互依赖关系，创立
  “敏感性模型”，为参与制定城市发展计划的规划者、管理者提供决策工具。
    人与生物圈计划，中国有，世界其它国家也有，目的是寻求同一个答案——为什么人们在享受自己获得的和创造的财富时，会时时受到大自然种种惩罚？因为人类在土壤侵蚀、沙漠化、滥伐森林、越来越多的物种濒临灭绝、环境污染等所导致的生态系统退化中，已经意识到能登月球、造核武器的人类，还没有真正揭开人与生物圈之间的秘密，对于人的自身生产、人的经济行为应该如何与生存环境相协调、相适应，还缺乏足够的认识。
    也许正是这个缘故，联合国针对全球日益严重的人口、资源和环境的挑战，以保护人类赖以生存的地球环境为宗旨的人与生物圈计划，格外受到世界各国的拥护和支持。这项松散的政府间科学计划自1971年开始实施以来，已经在100多个国家和地区开展了数千个实地科研项目，有数万人参加有关的培训活动。
    作为该计划理事国之一的中国，自1972年参加起就抱着极大的热情，国务院于1978年正式批准成立了相应的计划组织实施机构——中国人与生物圈国家委员会。迄今全国有37个有关项目列入中国人与生物圈计划，6个国家级自然保护区批准加入国际生物圈保护区网。人与生物圈计划已经成为跨地域、跨国界联系百余个国家和地区的专家学者运用生态学方法、研究人与环境相互关系的纽带，已经是为生物圈资源的合理利用和保护提供多学科、多领域依据的窗口。
    在我国长白山实施的温带森林生态系统研究计划，可以说是这种纽带和窗口的一个缩影。
    “森林死亡”像个幽灵正在威胁着经济发达的欧美诸国。这是欧洲森林破坏纪录卡所载的事实：“森林死亡”在联邦德国蔓延，在瑞士蔓延……据1985年底对欧洲15个国家的人工森林粗略统计，至少有700万公顷遭到这种灾难。
    而在纬度相近的中国吉林省长白山，有个面积为20多万公顷的林区，自1702年以来植被没有经受太大干扰，从山岩裸露、白雪皑皑的山巅，到针阔混交、林木遮天的山麓，十分明显的植被垂直带变化，没有夹杂人为的痕迹，是大自然创造的一个完整的东北亚山地生态系统。这里没有森林病虫害，众多的物种以最佳形式和谐协调地生存。
    欧洲人工林的衰退，是由大气污染物还是自然影响力诱发的？尽管对“森林死亡”症状做过大量研究，但在科学上看法不一。与此相反的长白山优化森林结构，正好成为欧洲病态森林最佳参照模式地。处于顶极群落的长白山原始林，其间500多种动物、1200多种植物是怎样构成复杂的食物链，进行有序的物质交换、能量流动的？是怎样维持稳定的生态平衡的？外国专家希望从欧亚大陆北半部山地生态系统典范的长白山自然保护区得到启示，以查清欧美“森林死亡”的原因，制订有效的控制对策；中国专家希望通过研究优化生态系统的结构、功能和生产力，揭开大自然更多的秘密，以寻找适合中国国情的林业之路。中外专家的希望，便成了国际间合作和交流的基础。
    中国人与生物圈计划，为这种合作和交流提供了条件。据悉，近两年来我国通过这个窗口，以信托基金等方式取得300多万美元的资助，展开了十几个生态环境合作研究课题，为国内外生物圈资源的合理利用和保护，提供了科学依据。
