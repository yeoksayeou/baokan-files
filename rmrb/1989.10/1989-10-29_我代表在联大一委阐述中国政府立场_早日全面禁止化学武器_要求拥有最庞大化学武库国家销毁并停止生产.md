	China's representative at the UNGA First Committee expounds the Chinese government's stance: Early comprehensive ban on chemical weapons
	Demanding countries with the largest chemical weapon arsenals to destroy and cease production

	United Nations, October 27 (Our Correspondent Liu Kai Chen) Today, at the 44th session of the UNGA First Committee's discussion on the issue of chemical weapons, Chinese Disarmament Ambassador Hou Zhi Tong announced, "To strive for an early comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of chemical weapons worldwide, so that humanity can forever be free from the harm and threat of these barbaric weapons of mass destruction, is an important goal and consistent stance of the Chinese government's peaceful foreign policy."

	Hou Zhi Tong stated, "China is a country without chemical weapons. It neither possesses nor produces chemical weapons, nor does it export chemicals intended for the production of chemical weapons. The Chinese people have historically suffered greatly from chemical weapons, and even today, remnants of chemical weapons left over from wars by foreign countries are still occasionally discovered on Chinese soil."

	Hou Zhi Tong pointed out that humanity has not yet escaped the shadow of chemical warfare. Countries with the largest chemical weapon arsenals should bear special responsibilities for the prohibition of chemical weapons. People hope that these countries will take genuine and practical actions, destroy their existing chemical weapons as soon as possible, and cease the production of chemical weapons, in order to facilitate the conclusion of an international convention for the comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons.

	Regarding the verification principles of the convention, Hou Zhi Tong expressed support for the developing countries' demand that they "not only bear the obligation of being inspected but also have the right to equal inspection, as well as the necessary capabilities and means to exercise this right." Hou Zhi Tong pointed out that since verification directly involves the sovereignty, domestic affairs, security, and economic interests of countries, it must be seriously and properly addressed.

　　我代表在联大一委阐述中国政府立场
　　早日全面禁止化学武器
　　要求拥有最庞大化学武库国家销毁并停止生产
    本报联合国10月27日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国裁军大使侯志通今天在第44届联大一委会议审议关于化学武器问题时宣布，“争取在全世界早日全面禁止和彻底销毁化学武器，使人类永远摆脱这种野蛮的大规模毁灭性武器的危害和威胁，是中国政府和平外交政策的一个重要目标和一贯立场”。
    侯志通说，中国是无化学武器国，既不拥有也不生产化学武器，不出口以制造化学武器为目的的化学品。中国人民在历史上深受化学武器之害，至今在国土上仍不时发现战时外国遗留下来的化学武器。
    侯志通指出，人类还没有摆脱化学战的阴影。拥有最庞大化学武库的国家，应对禁止化学武器承担特殊责任。人们希望它们能采取真正的实际行动，及早销毁它们现有的全部化学武器，并停止和生产化学武器，以利于缔结全面禁止化学武器的国际公约。
    关于公约的核查原则，侯志通表示支持发展中国家提出的它们“不仅应承担被核查的义务，而且还应获得平等核查的权利，以及行使这一权利的必要的能力和手段”的要求。侯志通指出，由于核查直接涉及各国的主权、内政、安全和经济权益，必须严肃认真地加以妥善解决。
