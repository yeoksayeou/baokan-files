The Central Discipline Inspection Commission recently held consecutive meetings of its standing committee to seriously study and discuss Jiang Zemin's important speech at the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In conjunction with the actual work of discipline inspection, a notice was issued to the national discipline inspection system, outlining the deployment of the study and implementation of Jiang Zemin's important speech.

The full text of the notice is as follows:

Jiang Zemin's important speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China uses the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to objectively affirm the great achievements of China's socialist revolution and construction over the past 40 years, especially since the reform and opening up. It scientifically summarizes the basic experience of the Party's leadership in socialist modernization and reform and opening up, and profoundly expounds on some major policy issues that are of great concern both domestically and internationally and that the Party and the people urgently need to address. This speech is a crystallization of collective wisdom and a programmatic document guiding the work of the entire Party. It has significant real and historical significance for unifying the thoughts of the entire Party and the people; for adhering to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up, guiding socialist modernization construction; for adhering to the Party's leadership, strengthening Party building, and fully playing the Party's core leadership role. Studying and implementing Jiang Zemin's speech is an important task for the national discipline inspection system in the current and future periods, and it must be firmly grasped and implemented.

1. To seriously study and deeply understand Jiang Zemin's speech, and to unify the thoughts of the broad disciplinary inspection cadres with the spirit of the speech. Jiang Zemin's speech fully embodies the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Deng Xiaoping's recent important speeches, serving as a powerful weapon for unifying the thoughts of the entire Party. All levels of disciplinary inspection agencies must strengthen leadership, arrange the study in a planned and step-by-step manner. The study of the speech should be combined with the study of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, especially Marxist philosophy, closely linked to the actual work and the lessons of the recent turmoil and rebellion, and targeted to clarify some vague understandings, unify thoughts, and improve the level of Marxist theory and the awareness of implementing the Party's basic line. Leading cadres of all levels of disciplinary inspection commissions should take the lead in studying the speech to drive and promote the in-depth study of the broad disciplinary inspection cadres.

2. To take the spirit of Jiang Zemin's speech as a guideline, further strengthen the construction of Party style and discipline. All levels of disciplinary inspection agencies should, based on the study and understanding of the spirit of the speech, closely combine with the actual work of disciplinary inspection, summarize experiences, and strengthen the construction of Party style and discipline. They should adhere to the Party Constitution to govern the Party strictly, take decisive and effective measures, remove obstacles and interference, strengthen cooperation with relevant departments, seriously investigate and deal with major cases, overcome some bureaucratism, power-seeking, and corrupt practices within the Party that alienate the masses, resolutely combat corruption, eliminate corrupt elements within the Party, and strictly enforce Party discipline. All disciplinary inspection cadres should uphold and carry forward the Party's fine tradition of combining theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, criticizing and self-criticizing, and struggling hard, and strive to work hard, strengthen the construction of Party style and discipline, and promote and ensure the smooth implementation of rectification and deepening of reform.

3. To strictly enforce Party discipline and ensure the high degree of unity in the Party's thoughts and actions. All levels of disciplinary inspection agencies should fully play their functional role. While focusing on punishing corruption and strictly enforcing Party discipline, they should continue to do a good job in cleaning up work. They should fully recognize the danger of international reactionary forces promoting "peaceful evolution" and the harm of bourgeois liberalization, and firmly uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and maintain consistency in thought, politics, and action with the Party Central Committee. Those who openly resist and oppose the Party's line, policies, and principles, and seriously lose their political stance and violate political discipline should be seriously investigated and dealt with, and actual actions should be taken to maintain the leadership and authority of the Party Central Committee and ensure the implementation of the Party's basic line.

    通知全文如下：
    江泽民同志在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年大会上的重要讲话，运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，实事求是地肯定了我国四十年来特别是改革开放以来社会主义革命和建设的巨大成就，科学地总结了我们党领导社会主义现代化建设和改革开放的基本经验，精辟地阐明了当前国内外极为关注、党内外迫切需要回答的一些重大方针问题。这个讲话是集体智慧的结晶，是指导全党工作的纲领性文件，对于统一全党、全国人民的思想；对于坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，指导社会主义现代化建设；对于坚持党的领导，加强党的建设，充分发挥党的核心领导作用，具有重大的现实意义和历史意义。学习好、贯彻好江泽民同志的讲话精神，是全国纪检系统当前和今后一个时期的重要任务，必须切实抓紧抓好。
      一、要认真学习、深刻理解江泽民同志的讲话，把广大纪检干部的思想统一到讲话精神上来。江泽民同志的讲话充分体现了党的十三届四中全会和邓小平同志最近几次重要讲话的精神，是统一全党思想的有力武器。各级纪检机关要切实加强领导，有计划、有步骤地安排好学习。要把学习讲话同学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，特别是马克思主义哲学结合起来，紧密联系思想、工作实际以及这次动乱和暴乱的教训，有针对性地澄清一些模糊认识，统一思想，提高马克思主义理论水平和贯彻执行党的基本路线的自觉性。各级纪委的领导干部要带头学好，以带动和促进广大纪检干部学习的深入。
    二、要以江泽民同志的讲话精神为指针，进一步加强党风党纪建设。各级纪检机关要在学习领会讲话精神的基础上，紧密联系纪检工作的实际，认真总结经验，切实加强党风党纪建设。要依据党章从严治党，采取坚决有力的措施，排除阻力和干扰，加强同有关部门的通力合作，严肃查处大案要案，克服党内某些官僚主义、以权谋私、腐化堕落等脱离群众的现象，坚决惩治腐败，清除党内腐败分子，严肃党的纪律。全体纪检干部要坚持和发扬党的理论联系实际、密切联系群众、批评与自我批评的优良作风和艰苦奋斗的革命传统，振奋精神，努力工作，加强党风党纪建设，促进和保证治理整顿、深化改革的顺利进行。
    三、要严格党的纪律，保证全党思想和行动上的高度统一。各级纪检机关要充分发挥职能作用，在抓好惩治腐败、严肃党的纪律的同时，继续搞好清理工作。要充分认识国际反动势力推行“和平演变”的危险性和资产阶级自由化的危害性，旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，在思想上、政治上、行动上同党中央保持一致，对那些公开抵制和反对党的路线、方针、政策，严重丧失政治立场、违犯政治纪律的人和事，要严肃查处，以实际行动维护党中央的领导和权威，保证党的基本路线的贯彻执行。
