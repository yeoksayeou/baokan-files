    Tightrope Walking
    In the Liupo County of Sichuan Province's Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the 20-meter-long iron chain bridge in Quyi Township was destroyed by a raging flood two years ago and has not been repaired since. Students on the opposite side of the river risk their lives every day to cross the bridge to go to school. This 9-year-old boy, He Lai Jiu Li, is currently climbing across the iron chain to cross the river, which is truly worrying.

    “走钢丝”
    四川凉山彝族自治州雷波县曲依乡长达20余米的铁索桥，两年前被滔滔洪水冲毁后，至今未修复，河对岸的学生们天天冒险过桥上学。这个年仅9岁的赫来纠里正攀踩着铁索过河，真叫人担心。
