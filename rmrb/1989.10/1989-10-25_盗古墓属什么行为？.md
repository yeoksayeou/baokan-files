Zheng Fa:

Ancient tombs are state-protected cultural relics. According to regulations from the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, tombs from the Qing Dynasty and earlier are considered ancient tombs. Tombs of famous historical figures related to significant historical events after the Xinhai Revolution are also considered ancient tombs. Article 31 of the Cultural Relics Protection Law states: "Those who privately excavate ancient cultural sites or ancient tombs shall be punished for theft." Article 174 of the Criminal Law states: "Those who intentionally destroy state-protected precious cultural relics or famous historical sites shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than seven years or criminal detention." The ancient tombs you mentioned are approximately 300 years old and thus should be considered ancient tombs. If they are privately excavated (including cases where no cultural relics are stolen but the circumstances are serious), it constitutes a crime and shall be punished as theft. If the ancient tombs have historical, artistic, or scientific value, those who intentionally destroy them (including those who use excavation methods) and constitute a crime shall be punished for the crime of destroying precious cultural relics or famous historical sites.

Citizens who discover clues of private excavation of ancient tombs can report them to the public security organs. If the tomb robbers' behavior constitutes a crime, it will be adjudicated by the people's court. If the accused's criminal circumstances are minor and constitute an illegal act, the public security organs will impose administrative penalties for disturbing public order.

　　盗古墓属什么行为？
　　编辑同志：
    今有300年左右历史的15座古墓被盗，墓内有金银首饰等物品。请问：盗古墓属什么行为？
    吉林公主岭市放马沟乡建设村　郑　发郑发同志：
    古墓葬属国家文物，受国家保护。依照最高人民法院、最高人民检察院有关规定，清代和清代以前的墓葬属古墓葬。辛亥革命以后，与著名历史事件有关的名人墓葬，也视为古墓葬。文物保护法第31条规定：“私自挖掘古文化遗址、古墓葬的，以盗窃论处。”刑法第174条规定：“故意破坏国家保护的珍贵文物、名胜古迹的，处7年以下徒刑或者拘役。”你所反映的古墓距今已有300年左右，这应当属古墓葬。如属于私自挖掘古墓葬（包括未窃到文物，但情节严重）构成犯罪的，以盗窃罪论处。如古墓葬具有历史、艺术、科学价值，对于故意破坏者（包括采取挖掘的手段），构成犯罪后以破坏珍贵文物、名胜古迹罪处刑。
    公民发现私自挖掘古墓葬的线索后，可向公安机关检举。盗墓者的行为构成犯罪的，由人民法院判决。如果被控告者犯罪情节轻微属于违法，由公安机关按妨害社会管理秩序行为给予治安处罚。
