The appearance of Zhong Xu's reportage literature "The Big Picture" (published in the May 1989 issue of "Kunlun") is a significant achievement in the development of military literature in recent years. It reflects the author's deep thoughts on the construction of the military.

"The Big Picture" examines the fate of the entire military in the context of the reform tide through the eyes of generals of the Republic. The writer's focus is no longer on a specific unit but on the entire 3 million-strong military of the Republic. The military needs to reflect on its role in the reform from a high vantage point, and military literature writers also need to understand this significant social reality from a high perspective.

Zhong Xu uses the generals' thinking to examine the military. He aims to express his own views on all major issues facing the military: about military training and combat, about military political work, about military self-reliance in production, about military management, about revolutionary heroism, about military scientific construction, about the concept of the sea, about the essence of the military, and so on. It can be seen that each of these topics could be the subject of one or more substantial articles, but Zhong Xu has provided valuable insights, making the work highly comprehensive and rich in information.

Among these chapters, the most vividly written are those on reforming training, political thought work reform, self-reliance in production, internal decision-making, and the concept of the sea. "The Big Picture" has the following characteristics in its reflections on the military's survival and development:

Firstly, in the context of the global situation, it absorbs new military theoretical concepts. Zhong Xu not only pays attention to the impact of reform on the military but also to the military's own reform. He seeks the vitality of the Chinese military in standing among the world's top military powers. He discovers that Generals Wang Chenghan and Zheng Wenhan work together to push open the heavy iron door, allowing the Chinese Military Academy, a high-level military science hall, to face the entire world. He finds that General He Daoqian often speaks about the global military situation at various meetings. As a soldier, General He pays attention to global trends and uses new ways of thinking to guide training within his limited authority. He also pays more attention to the response capabilities of special forces. He Daoqian's ski training plan received the recognition and support of higher-level leaders.

Secondly, in the context of national cultural psychology, it excavates the essence of tradition. Zhong Xu compares the adjustment of military political thought work in recent years to a "strategic retreat," which is a vivid metaphor. The daily political thought work of the Chinese military has historical traditions and is deeply imprinted with national cultural psychology, and is also constrained by national cultural psychology. In the past, we understood these traditions more from a political perspective and less from the perspective of national cultural psychology, so many good traditions were easily affected by politics and not firmly upheld. Take the example of officers and soldiers celebrating the Spring Festival together; people often think it is just about officers and soldiers enjoying themselves together. However, Zhong Xu sees a different meaning in General Li Guangxiang's actions. Li General has spent eight consecutive Spring Festivals with soldiers in remote outposts, and before each festival, he intentionally checks to see if there are any deficiencies in material or spiritual aspects. He believes: "Unlike the West, Chinese people emphasize family love from birth to death. With this cultural psychology, soldiers subconsciously treat the company as a family, and the company commander and political instructor play a role similar to parents. This is the unique mentality of Chinese soldiers." This is so natural and full of human touch, integrating political factors and national cultural psychology. Zhong Xu has discovered a new approach to carrying forward the essence of tradition from Li Guangxiang's actions, which is very enlightening for us to understand and carry forward tradition.

Thirdly, in the context of enduring hardships, it advocates the spirit of creating a "microclimate." In a strict sense, in this tightly organized military organization, any major change should be led by the highest command. However, the Chinese military has its own difficulties: there is no money, and the national economy needs to develop, so military spending cannot be increased much. This predicament forces General Wang Chenghan to study the issue of subsidizing tofu, and this predicament also forces various units to create a "microclimate" to get through the difficulties of survival and development. Zhong Xu understands the military's predicament and appreciates the active spirit of the military in creating a "microclimate," as well as the difficulties in these actions. More importantly, he sees a future in the military's actions. They do things that are not supposed to be done by soldiers, but they aim to achieve the goals that soldiers should achieve. This is the characteristic of the Chinese military's work in this stage.

The affairs of China, including the affairs of the Chinese military, are so wonderful. One cannot rush or wait; one must face this complex reality, have both the spirit of endurance and the spirit of active creation. Without understanding these, one cannot truly understand the Chinese military, and one cannot truly understand China.

In terms of the authenticity of reportage literature, military literature faces greater difficulties and more limitations, which are due to the special nature of the military. For this reason, reportage literature on military reality topics has been somewhat unpopular for a while. Zhong Xu, however, persists in investigating and researching in the military, traveling over ten thousand miles and taking two to three months, finally obtaining a large amount of first-hand data. He deeply understands the actual situation of the military and can make constructive analyses and understandings of the actual situation. Therefore, he can grasp and summarize the main trends of military affairs.

"The Big Picture" tells us: truly understanding and studying this military, truly understanding this military, and truly making constructive analyses of this military can produce works full of philosophical colors.

    对军队生存发展命运的思考
    ——评报告文学《大势》
    阿部
    部队作家中夙的报告文学《大势》（载《昆仑》1989年5期）的出现，是近年来军事文学发展中的重大收获。这里面倾注了作者对部队建设的思考。
    《大势》透过共和国将军们的眼光，来思考整个军队在改革大潮中的生存与发展的命运。作家的考察对象，不再是一个具体单位，而是共和国的300万军队的整体。军队需要站在很高的角度上来反思自己在改革中的作为，军事文学作家也需要站在很高的角度上来认识这种重大的社会现实。
    中夙用将军们的思路来考察军队，他想对军队面临所有重大问题，都发表点属于自己的看法：关于军队的训练作战、关于军队的思想政治工作、关于军队的生产自救、关于军队的管理、关于革命英雄主义、关于军队科学建设、关于海洋观念、关于军队的本质等等。可以看出，这里面的任何一项，都有一篇或若干篇大文章好做，但中夙都作出了有价值的探讨，使作品具有较高的概括力和很大的信息量。
    在这诸多章节中，写得最有声有色的，当数关于改革训练、政治思想工作改革、生产自救、内部决策和海洋观念这几章。《大势》对于军队生存发展的思考具有以下的特点：
    一、在世界格局中，吸收军事理论新观念。中夙不仅注意改革对军队的影响，他更注意军队自身的改革，军队以什么样的姿态和面貌出现在世界之中，军队本身是否是个封闭的系统。他寻找的是中国军队跻身于世界强手之林的活力。他发现王诚汉将军、郑文瀚将军合力将沉重的铁门推开，让中国军事科学院这座高等军事科学殿堂面对着整个世界。他发现何道泉将军动不动就在各种会议上大讲全球的军事态势。作为军人，何将军关注的是世界风云，他在自己有限权力范围内，运用新的思维方式指导训练。他更注意特种部队的反应能力。何道泉的滑雪部队训练计划得到了上级领导的认同和支持。
    二、在民族文化心理中发掘传统的精华。
    中夙把这几年军队思想政治工作的调整比作是一次“战略撤退”，这个比喻有其形象性。中国军队的日常政治思想工作，是有着历史传统的。也深深地打下了民族文化心理的烙印，并受民族的文化心理制约。过去我们认识这些传统，从政治意义看得多，从民族文化心理角度看得少，因而有很多好传统容易受政治影响而坚持不够。就拿官兵同过春节这件事来说，人们往往只认为是干部与士兵同乐，但中夙从李光祥将军的言行中，看到了另外一番新意。李将军连续八年在连队边远哨所和战士们一起度过春节，每逢节前还有意去检查一下，看物质的精神的哪方面因素还欠缺，他这样以为：“同西方不一样，中国人从生到死都强调家庭之爱，带着这样一个文化心理参军入伍，士兵潜意识中是把连队当作家庭对待，连长、指导员则在一定程度上扮演了父母一类的角色，这是中国士兵的特殊心态。”这是多么自然，多么充满人情味，它融政治因素和民族文化心理为一体。中夙从李光祥将军的言行中，已经发现了一条发扬传统精华的新思路，这对我们认识传统和发扬传统，是大有启迪作用的。
    三、在忍耐的困境中倡导创造“小气候”的精神。
    就严格的意义而言，在军队这个组织严密的团体中，任何一项大的变革，都应该是最高指挥部唱主角。然而，中国军队却有其难言之隐：没有钱，国家经济要发展，军费不能提高许多。这种困境使得王诚汉将军不得不研究补助豆腐问题，这种困境也不得不使各部队创造
  “小气候”，以度过生存发展的难关。中夙理解军队的困境，也赞赏部队在创造“小气候”的积极精神，还理解军队在这些行动中的为难之处。更重要的是，他从军队的行动中，看到了一种未来。他们做着不是军人应该干的事情，但他们却要达到是军人所要达到的目的。这就是中国军队在现阶段的工作特征。
    中国的事情包括中国军队的事情就是这么奇妙，一点也急不得，一点也等不得，必须面对这种复杂现实，既要有忍耐精神，又要有积极创造精神，不了解这些，就不能算真正地了解中国军队，就不算真正了解中国。
    就纪实性的报告文学而言，军事文学具有更大的难处和更多的局限性，这是由于军队的特殊性造成的。正因为这样，表现军队现实题材的报告文学一度不太景气。中夙在这样的氛围中，依然坚持在部队的调查研究，行程上万里，历时两三月，终于取得了大量第一手资料。他深刻地了解军队的实际情况，并能对实际情况作出建设性地剖析和认识。因而，他就能够把握和概括军旅大势的主脉。
    《大势》告诉我们：真正地了解和研究这支军队，真正地懂得这支军队，真正对这支军队进行建设性地剖析，可以产生出充满思辨色彩的好作品来。
