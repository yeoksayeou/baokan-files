Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 30th.

Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee, met with former U.S. President Richard Nixon this morning at the Great Hall of the People. The two sides engaged in a friendly and extensive conversation.

Nixon said, "I was a friend of China 17 years ago, and I am still a friend of China today. I care about China and want to understand the future of China's reform and opening-up policy and its development prospects."

Li Ruihuan explained to the guest the necessity of China's reform and opening-up policy from the perspectives of theoretical principles, social development, historical experience, current realities, and the will of the people.

He said, "We adhere to the socialist system as a historical choice made by the Chinese people after long struggles and various explorations. We adhere to reform and opening-up, following the basic principles of Marxism, based on the inherent requirements of the socialist system, and summarizing the experiences of several decades of construction. For socialism, without adherence, there can be no reform, and without reform, it is difficult to adhere. Of course, the process of reform and opening-up is one of gradual improvement. In this process, we must continuously accumulate experience, overcome shortcomings, and correct mistakes." He also said, "Ten years of reform and opening-up have brought tangible benefits to the Chinese people. Continuing to adhere to reform and opening-up is the shared will of all the people in China. This is an irreversible trend in today's China."

　　李瑞环会见尼克松
    新华社北京10月30日电　中共中央政治局常委李瑞环今天上午在人民大会堂会见了美国前总统尼克松，宾主进行了友好、广泛的交谈。
    尼克松说：“我17年前是中国的朋友，今天仍是中国的朋友。我关心中国，愿意了解中国今后改革开放政策的前途和中国的发展前景。”
    李瑞环从理论原则、社会发展、历史经验、现实情况和人民意愿等方面，向客人说明了中国实行改革开放政策的必然性。
    他说，我们坚持社会主义制度是中国人民长期奋斗、多方探索最终做出的历史选择。我们坚持改革开放，是遵照马克思主义的基本原理，根据社会主义制度的自身要求，总结几十年来的建设经验所作出的战略决策。对于社会主义来说，不坚持就谈不上改革，不改革也就难以坚持。当然，改革开放的过程是一个逐步完善的过程。在这个过程中，我们要不断积累经验，克服缺点，纠正失误。他还说，10年改革开放给中国人民带来了切切实实的利益，继续坚持改革开放，是全中国人民的共同意愿。这是当今中国不可逆转的趋势。
