Title: Provide a Paradise for the Children

Two pieces of news come from Dalian, one praiseworthy and the other condemnable, both concerning children. However, the attitudes and actions of these two units are so different!

A zoo should be a paradise for children. But with the rise of the profit-seeking wind, Dalian Zoo has become a place that does not care about harming children's hearts and minds, only knowing how to dig into the pockets of children's parents. This will probably not leave a good impression on either the children or their parents.

A restaurant is not a place where children often go. However, for the healthy growth of children and the convenience of their parents, the Jiankangshan Hotel in Dalian does not mind the trouble and does not seek profit, turning the dining hall into a second home for children. This spirit deserves to be praised.

Our society, our adults, what kind of growth environment are we providing for the children? The stark contrast between these two pieces of news is worth pondering over and over again!

Supplying goods for children and serving them, yet raising prices shamelessly, this is already bad enough. Even worse is that the mentality of "everything for money" has reached the point where even superstition and gambling, these filthy things, have entered the children's paradise! Making money this way, can one's heart be at ease?

The innocent and pure hearts of children should have a healthy paradise. Comrade, what can you do for the children's paradise?

    给孩子们一个乐园
    三保
    两则消息同出于大连，一褒一贬又都事关孩子。然而，这两个单位的态度、做法，是多么不同呵！
    动物园本是孩子的乐园。赚钱之风起处，大连动物园却成了连孩子心灵受害都不顾、只知一味去掏孩子父母腰包的地方，这恐怕对孩子、对家长都不会留下好印象。
    饭店是孩子们不常光顾之地。而为了孩子们的健康成长和家长的方便，大连井冈山饭店不嫌烦，不求利，把店堂办成了孩子们的第二个家，这种精神理应受到赞扬。
    我们的社会，我们的成年人，究竟给孩子们提供一个什么样的成长环境？两则消息的鲜明对照，值得人们深思再三！
    供应孩子们商品，为孩子服务，竟也昧心抬价，这已经很坏了。更坏的是，“一切向钱看”竟到了让迷信、赌博这些污七八糟的东西也进了儿童乐园的地步！这么赚钱，心里可安生？
    幼小、纯净的心灵，应该有健康的乐园。同志，你为孩子们的乐园能做些什么？
