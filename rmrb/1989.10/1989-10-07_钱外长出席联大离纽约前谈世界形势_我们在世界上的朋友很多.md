Everyone hopes that the United Nations will play an active role in resolving these issues.

During his attendance at the UNGA, Qian met with the President of the current session and the UN Secretary-General.

Qian introduced China's situation and its independent and peaceful foreign policy to the representatives of various countries at the UNGA. He said that the vast majority of countries, especially those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have expressed friendly feelings towards China. They understand and support China's position against foreign interference in its internal affairs, and are pleased with the stability of China's domestic political and economic situation. They also congratulate China on the achievements made by the People's Republic of China over the past 40 years. Qian said, "We have many friends in the world."

Qian also took this opportunity to interact with various sectors of American society, introducing China's domestic situation to them. He explained China's views on the current state of Sino-American relations and its proposals for restoring and developing these relations, and answered their questions. Qian said, "It is undeniable that Sino-American relations currently face difficulties. However, 'Sino-American relations are widely valued by the American people. With the stabilization and further development of China's domestic situation and the increasing understanding of the actual situation by the American people, Sino-American relations will ultimately continue to move forward on the correct track.'"

    他说，纳米比亚的独立进程，中东和柬埔寨等问题的政治解决都受到各国关注。发展中国家面临的经济困难也十分突出。大家都希望联合国为解决这些问题发挥积极作用。
    在出席联大期间，钱外长分别拜会了本届联大主席和联合国秘书长，并在联大会议上阐明了中国独立自主的和平外交政策和对一系列重大国际问题的主张。他的发言赢得了全场的热烈掌声。50多个国家的代表拥到中国席位旁，同钱外长握手祝贺。在短短八天里，钱外长还同47个国家的总理或外长进行了会晤。
    钱外长在联大向各国代表介绍了中国的情况，阐明了中国独立自主的和平外交政策。他说，绝大多数国家，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的外长，都对中国表达了友好的感情，对中国不久前发生的事情表示理解，支持中国政府反对外国干涉中国内政的立场，并对中国国内政治、经济形势的稳定表示高兴，对中华人民共和国40年来取得的成就表示祝贺。钱外长说，“我们在世界上的朋友是很多的”。
    钱外长还利用这次机会同美国各界人士进行了一些接触，向他们介绍了中国国内的形势，说明了中国对中美关系现状的看法和对恢复、发展中美关系的主张，并回答了他们提出的问题。钱外长说，“毋庸讳言，中美关系目前存在着困难。但是，“中美关系在美国人民心目中是受到广泛重视的。随着中国国内形势的稳定和进一步发展，随着美国人民对实际情况的日益了解，中美关系终究是会沿着正确的轨道继续前进的”。　（姚海泉）
