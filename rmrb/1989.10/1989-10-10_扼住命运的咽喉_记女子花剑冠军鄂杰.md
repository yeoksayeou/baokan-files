After E Jie struck her final blow, defeating Shen Chengzi, she forcefully removed her helmet. Her cheeks glistened with tears or sweat, even she couldn't tell the difference. She raised her three-foot blade and choked out to the audience, "Thank you!"

"Opportunities are equal for everyone, but fate has been particularly cruel to me. I can only tightly grasp every chance..."

In China's women's foil fencing, the stars shine brightly in Tianjin and Jiangsu. For a Beijing girl like E Jie to have a place in Chinese women's foil, it is truly hard-won. In her nearly 10-year fencing career, E Jie has faced numerous setbacks. In the 1987 World Youth Championships in Brazil, she was in excellent form. After the first round, she was ranked third. Unexpectedly, she encountered a little-known Japanese fencer. The opponent was short, and E Jie, unable to hit her several times, became impatient and ultimately lost in confusion, leaving her with a regret she would never forget.

"If I had done well, the Olympics would also have been within reach," E Jie recalled, speaking calmly, "I have had few opportunities to participate in major international competitions. Every time I go out, I cherish it. The more I want to do well, the more nervous I get, and thus the vicious cycle continues. However, after experiencing many setbacks, I feel I have matured."

E Jie on the fencing strip is a different person from E Jie off the strip. When she raises her sword, she is full of spirit; but when she steps off the strip, she wears glasses and exudes a strong scholarly aura. Asked about E Jie, she indeed comes from an academic family. Her father is a senior engineer at the subway company, and her mother is a teacher. She told me that she is currently training and competing while also studying at the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, now in her second year.

E Jie has been fencing since she was 13, and nine years have passed. She has finally climbed to a new stage in her life's journey. Beethoven once said, "I will seize fate by the throat..." Perhaps the young Chinese girl E Jie has gained insight from this great German composer. For her, the "Symphony of Fate" has just begun its first movement.

    “扼住命运的咽喉”
    ——记女子花剑冠军鄂杰
    鄂杰刺完最后一剑、击败申成子后，猛地掀掉头盔。只见她面颊上亮晶晶的一片，是泪水还是汗水，连她自己也分不清了。她扬起三尺青锋，向着观众席哽咽着喊道：“谢谢你们！”
    “机会对每个人都是均等的，但命运对我特别苛刻，我只有紧紧抓住每一次机会……”
    在我国剑坛女子花剑项目中，群星闪烁当属天津、江苏两地，北京姑娘鄂杰能在中国女花占有一席之地，确实来之不易。鄂杰在近10年的剑坛生涯中，总是命运多蹇。1987年在巴西举行的世界青年锦标赛上，她状态极佳，第1轮赛完后排为第3号种子。未料此后她遇上一个名不见经传的日本选手，对方是个矮个子，她几次刺不着就有些急躁，最后糊里糊涂地输了下来，留下令她终生都难忘怀的遗憾。
    “如果打好了，奥运会也是有希望参加的。”鄂杰忆起往事，淡淡地说：“我参加大型国际比赛机会不多，每次出去都十分珍惜。越想打好越紧张，于是恶性循环。不过，经历了多次坎坷后，我觉得自己成熟了。”
    剑台上的鄂杰与走下剑台的她判若两人。当她举起利剑时，英气逼人；可是走下剑台的她戴着一副眼镜，透着浓浓的书卷气。问起鄂杰，果然是书香门第，父亲是地铁公司的高级工程师，母亲是一位教师。她告诉我，目前她一边训练比赛，一边参加北京体育运动技术学院的学习，现在已是2年级学生了。
    鄂杰自13岁学剑起，于今已9载春秋悠悠逝去。她终于登上了生命里程的一个新阶梯。贝多芬说过：“我要扼住命运的咽喉……”年轻的中国姑娘鄂杰或许正是从这位伟大的德国作曲家那里获得真谛的。对她来说，《命运交响曲》刚刚奏出第一个乐章。本报记者　陈昭
