The general manager of the Shuaizi Peanut Company in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, Nian Guangjiu, has been arrested for embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds.

Nian Guangjiu was one of the first individuals in Wuhu City to operate the uniquely flavored "Shuaizi Peanuts," becoming a well-known individual entrepreneur. Local party organizations and the government had previously acknowledged his beneficial contributions. In 1984, Nian Guangjiu, in collaboration with the Xinwu District of Wuhu City and the Qingshui Town Industrial Company of Wuhu County, established the Shuaizi Peanut Company, with him serving as the manager. Due to poor management, the company accumulated significant debts and was on the verge of bankruptcy starting in 1987. According to public reports, during Nian Guangjiu's tenure, there were serious economic issues. The Xinwu District Procuratorate of Wuhu City conducted an investigation and confirmed that he had abused his position to sell 7,000 sacks of the company's goods to another unit in January 1985, obtaining 9,800 yuan in illicit funds. Additionally, he embezzled 3,000 yuan in wages and other expenses for the peanut quality control personnel, totaling 12,800 yuan in embezzled funds. Furthermore, he misappropriated over 210,000 yuan of company funds. For these reasons, the Xinwu District People's Procuratorate of Wuhu City decided to arrest him according to the law.

The case is currently under trial.

    贪污挪用大笔公款
    傻子瓜子公司总经理年广九被捕
    新华社合肥10月5日电　安徽省芜湖市傻子瓜子公司总经理年广九因犯贪污和挪用公款罪，日前被依法逮捕。
    年广九当年在芜湖市最先经营风味独特的“傻子瓜子”，成为有名的个体户，地方党组织和政府曾肯定过他的有益作用。1984年，年广九与芜湖市新芜区和芜湖县清水镇工业公司联合成立傻子瓜子总公司，由他担任经理。由于经营不善，负债累累，自1987年起该公司濒于倒闭。据群众举报，年广九任职期间存在严重的经济问题。芜湖市新芜区检察院立案侦查确认，他利用职务之便，于1985年1月将公司7000条麻袋卖给一单位，获赃款9800元，同时将瓜子监制人员工资等费用3000元纳入私囊，两项共贪污1.28万元。另外他还挪用公司公款21万多元。为此，芜湖市新芜区人民检察院决定，依法将其逮捕。
    目前此案正在审理中。
