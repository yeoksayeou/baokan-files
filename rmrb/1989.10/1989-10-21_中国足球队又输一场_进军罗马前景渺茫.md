China's football team lost another match tonight, making their chances of advancing to Rome seem increasingly unlikely.

The New China News Agency reported from Singapore on October 20th that China's football team lost 0-1 to South Korea tonight. Their hopes of advancing to Rome are now very slim.

In tonight's third round of the World Cup football qualifiers for the Asian region, China's team was outmatched by South Korea in both offense and defense. In the first half, Guo Yijun made a crucial save to keep the score at 0-0. In the 21st minute of the second half, South Korea's Kim Chul-seong scored with a header in the penalty area, and Fu Yubin failed to stop the ball, which flew into the left side of the goal.

After this loss, China's team will not have more than 6 points in the final standings, making their chances of advancing extremely slim.

In another match, North Korea defeated Qatar 2-0.

　　中国足球队又输一场
　　进军罗马前景渺茫
    新华社新加坡10月20日电　中国足球队今晚以0∶1负于南朝鲜队后，进军罗马的希望已微乎其微。
    中国队今晚在世界杯足球赛亚洲区预选决赛的第三轮比赛，攻防均不如南朝鲜队，上半时亏得郭亿军救出一个险球，才使上半场比分保持为0∶0。下半时21分钟左右，南朝鲜队金铸成在中国队禁区内鱼跃冲顶，傅玉斌扑球不及，眼看着球飞入大门左侧。
    中国队这场球踢输后，最后积分不会超过6分，出线的前景已变得十分渺茫。
    另外一场比赛，朝鲜队2∶0战胜卡塔尔队。
