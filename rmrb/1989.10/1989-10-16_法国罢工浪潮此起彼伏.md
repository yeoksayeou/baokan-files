Since the autumn of this year, workers across France have launched a wave of strikes demanding job security, wage increases, and improved working conditions. Workers from France's largest private car manufacturer, Peugeot, were the first to take to the streets. Soon after, tax officials, customs workers, hospital nurses, prison guards, and others joined the strike.

Peugeot's two main production bases, Mulhouse and Sochaux factories, have over 30,000 workers, and their strike has now entered its sixth week. Due to the management's refusal to meet the workers' demands, two mediation attempts by the French government have failed. This strike has significantly reduced the company's car production, resulting in substantial economic losses. Recently, company officials revealed that the planned car production for September was 130,000 vehicles, but only 46,000 were actually produced. October's production is also expected to be severely affected.

The strike by tax officials, which has spread across 44 provinces, has caused chaos and losses in various economic sectors. After halting tax collection, the government had to borrow from banks to maintain normal operations. On September 25th and October 2nd, the Ministry of Finance borrowed 60 billion francs and 50 billion francs at interest rates of 8.73% and 9.21%, respectively. If the tax officials continue their strike, including 5 million civil servants and retirees, they will not receive their October salaries on time.

### 法国罢工浪潮此起彼伏

    法国罢工浪潮此起彼伏
    新华社巴黎10月15日电（记者茅瑞清、郭京花）今年入秋以来，法国各地职工掀起了要求保障就业、增加工资和改善工作条件的罢工浪潮。法国最大的私营汽车生产公司——标致公司的工人率先走上街头。接着，税务人员、海关人员、医院护士、监狱看守等相继加入罢工行列。
    标致汽车公司的两个主要生产基地——牟罗兹和索舒工厂共有3万多工人，他们的罢工到今天已进入第6个星期。由于资方坚持拒绝工人的要求，法国政府的两次调解都失败了。这次罢工使这个公司的汽车产量大幅度下降，经济损失相当惨重。公司的负责人最近透露，按计划，9月份的汽车产量为13万辆，实际上只出厂4.6万辆，10月份的产量肯定也将大受影响。
    波及全国44个省的税务人员的罢工给各经济部门造成了混乱和损失。停止税收后，政府不得不向银行贷款来维持各部门的正常运转。仅9月25日和10月2日，财政部就两次分别以8.73％和9.21％的利率借款60亿法郎和50亿法郎。如果税务人员继续罢工，包括退休人员在内的500万公职人员10月份就不能按时领到工资了。
