The Red Army Meeting Hall in Huining County, Gansu Province, has been renovated and opened to the public on October 1st.

In October 1936, the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army successfully met in Huining during their Long March. Early this year, relevant departments in Gansu Province allocated funds for the renovation. Inside the meeting hall, valuable relics left by the Red Army from that time are on display.
