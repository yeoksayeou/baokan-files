The State Council has decided that starting from this autumn and winter, the masses will be mobilized to concentrate manpower and resources, carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance, and persist for three to five years to vigorously promote agricultural water conservancy construction. This is a major decision to strengthen agriculture and stabilize the economy in the context of reform and opening up. Local governments at all levels should conscientiously implement the spirit of the State Council's "Decision on Vigorous Promotion of Agricultural Water Conservancy Construction," and make use of the winter slack season to timely incorporate agricultural water conservancy construction into the central work of rural areas, grasp it tightly, achieve results, and strive to change the face of agricultural water conservancy in China within three to five years. This will lay the foundation for the near-term agricultural harvest and the new development of agriculture in the 1990s, and create conditions for agriculture to break out of its stagnant situation.

The stable growth of agricultural production, especially grain production, is related to the overall economy, social stability, and the development of various undertakings and the consolidation of the alliance between workers and peasants. Forty years of practice have repeatedly told us that without water conservancy, agriculture cannot be stable. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his National Day speech: "We must increase the input of the state, local governments, collectives, and farmers into agriculture, expand agricultural water conservancy construction, vigorously develop agricultural industries, and improve agricultural production conditions." Comrade Li Peng emphasized in his report to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress: "To ensure a good agricultural harvest, we must pay great attention to agricultural land construction and water conservancy construction, strengthen river management, enhance disaster resistance, and especially ensure the safety of major rivers during the flood season." Central leaders have also repeatedly emphasized this issue during their inspections in various places. This fully shows that the Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to agriculture and agricultural water conservancy construction.

Chinese farmers have long had the tradition of utilizing the agricultural off-season to build water conservancy projects, improve land, and accumulate farmyard manure. Various places have accumulated a wealth of experience in the long-term practice of land improvement, water and soil conservation, and mountain management. However, in the past few years when agriculture developed relatively quickly and achieved good harvests, some comrades have neglected agricultural water conservancy construction. Many places have seen varying degrees of damage to existing water conservancy facilities, production conditions have not been significantly improved, and the ability to resist natural disasters has not been significantly enhanced, and in some cases, it has even weakened. Experts estimate that even in normal years, the grain production affected by droughts and floods nationwide reaches 10 billion kilograms, and the reduction in disaster years is even greater. This is an important reason why China's grain production has been stagnant since 1984. In the past two years, under the guidance of positive and negative experiences, a mass movement of agricultural water conservancy construction, which has not been seen in many years, has gradually emerged in some regions. Competitions focused on promoting self-reliance and hard work have been successful in many places and have been supported by the masses. However, in terms of the whole country, the scale and speed of agricultural water conservancy construction are far from meeting the needs of agricultural development and are far from the requirements for significantly improving production conditions and establishing a stable agricultural foundation. The development is very uneven, with some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions averaging more than 20 man-days per labor force per year, while others have only 3 to 5 man-days. Some places have increased investment from multiple sources, while others have not yet restored water conservancy investment to the level of 1980. This shows that we must deeply understand the spirit of the State Council's decision and the relevant speeches of central leaders, and it is necessary to re-recognize the enormous role of agricultural water conservancy construction in agricultural development and to vigorously promote mass agricultural water conservancy construction activities across the country.

Utilizing the winter slack season to build water conservancy projects and improve land not only meets the needs of strengthening the agricultural foundation, enhancing agricultural potential, developing agricultural production, and stabilizing the national economy, but also helps to solve the problem of surplus labor in rural areas (especially seasonal labor idleness).

In the past, China's agricultural water conservancy construction has seen several peaks, with both experiences and lessons. The key point is to adhere to the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts and never to engage in formalism. All projects should prioritize benefits, be scientific, emphasize quality, seek practical results, and achieve one project, complete one project, and gain one benefit. This winter and next spring, agricultural water conservancy work should focus on the repair and matching of existing projects according to the arrangements of the State Council, which can achieve twice the results with half the effort. Local governments should start with the most urgent problems, those with the strongest public response, and the most significant economic benefits, and strive to combine agricultural water conservancy construction with local agricultural development, commodity base construction, and the transformation of low- and medium-yield fields, so that agricultural water conservancy construction has local characteristics and adheres to the principle of benefits from the beginning to the end.

The facts in various places show that there is a strong enthusiasm among the masses for vigorously promoting agricultural water conservancy construction; the voices of farmers for water management and business development and changing production conditions are getting louder. The key now is for leaders at all levels to fully understand their responsibilities and take on the task of organizing the masses. The State Council's decision proposes: "The success or failure of agricultural water conservancy construction and the increase or decrease of water conservancy fixed assets should be an important part of the performance evaluation of local governments at all levels." Local governments should conscientiously implement this and start from this autumn and winter to see how agricultural water conservancy construction is being carried out in their areas and whether it is effective.

Water conservancy construction involves various industries and departments and requires coordinated efforts. Relevant departments should support agriculture with practical actions, ensure the supply of materials, machinery, funds, and other resources for agricultural water conservancy construction, actively cooperate with water conservancy departments to do a good job in various tasks, and contribute to agriculture breaking out of its stagnant situation with practical actions!

### 大力开展农田水利基本建设

　　大力开展农田水利基本建设
    国务院决定，从今年秋冬起，发动群众，集中人力物力，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生精神，连续坚持三、五年时间，大力开展农田水利基本建设。这是在改革开放中加强农业，稳定经济的一项重大决策。各级政府应当认真贯彻国务院《关于大力开展农田水利基本建设的决定》精神，利用冬闲季节，不失时机地将农田水利基本建设纳入农村的中心工作，抓紧抓好，抓出成效，争取在三五年时间内进一步改变我国农田水利面貌，为近期的农业丰收和九十年代农业的新发展打下基础，为农业突破徘徊局面创造条件。
    农业生产特别是粮食生产稳定增长与否，关系到国民经济全局，关系到社会稳定，关系到各项事业的发展与工农联盟的巩固。40年来的实践反复告诉我们，水利不兴，农业不稳。江泽民同志在国庆讲话中提出：“要增加国家、地方、集体和农民对农业的投入，扩大农田水利基本建设，大力发展农用工业，改善农业生产条件”。李鹏同志在七届人大二次会议的政府工作报告中强调：“为了保证农业丰收，必须十分重视搞好农田基本建设和水利建设，加强江河治理，提高抗灾能力，尤其要确保大江大河防汛安全”。中央领导同志在各地视察期间也曾多次强调了这一问题。这充分表明，党中央、国务院对农业和农田水利基本建设是高度重视的。
    我国农民历来也有利用农闲兴修水利、整治土地、积造农家肥的传统习惯，各地在长期的改土整地、治山治水的实践中曾积累了相当丰富的经验。但是，在前几年农业有较快发展，近几年也获得较好收成的情况下，一些同志对农田水利基本建设有所忽视。不少地方已有的水利设施遭到不同程度的损害，生产条件未能得到很好的改造，抗御自然灾害的能力未有明显增强，有的还有所削弱。有关专家估计，即使在正常年份，全国因水荒和水患而影响的粮食产量即达100亿公斤，灾年的减产幅度更大。这是自1984年以来我国粮食生产一直徘徊不前的一个重要原因。近两年来，各地在正反两方面的经验教训的鞭策下，一个多年少见的农田水利基本建设的群众运动又逐步在一些地区开展起来；以弘扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗精神为主要内容的各种治山治水的竞赛活动，在不少地方取得成功，得到了群众的拥护和支持。但就全国而言，农田水利基本建设无论是规模和速度，都远远不能适应农业发展的需要，跟明显改善生产条件、建立一个稳定的农业基础的要求相差甚远。各地发展很不平衡，有的省、市、自治区平均一年每个劳力投入20多个工日，有的只有三五个工日；有的多方增加资金投入，有的水利投资至今尚未恢复到1980年的水平。这说明，我们必须深刻领会国务院决定和中央领导同志的有关讲话精神，有必要对农田水利基本建设在农业发展中的巨大作用来个重新认识，重新把群众性的农田水利基本建设活动在全国范围内扎扎实实地开展起来。
    利用冬闲季节兴修水利、改土整地，不仅是加强农业基础，增强农业后劲，发展农业生产，稳定国民经济的需要，也有利于解决农村剩余劳动力的问题（尤其是季节性的劳力闲散）。
    过去，我国农田水利基本建设有过几次高潮，有经验，也有教训，集中到一点，就是必须坚持实事求是的科学态度，任何时候都不能搞形式主义那一套。所有工程要以效益为上，讲科学、重质量、求实效，做到建一项，成一项，获得一项效益。今冬明春，农田水利工作根据国务院的安排，重点应放在已有工程的修复和配套上，这样能取得事半功倍的效果。各地要从最迫切、群众反映最强烈、经济效益最显著的问题着手，力求把农田水利基本建设和当地的农业开发结合起来，与商品基地建设结合起来，与改造中低产田结合起来，使农田水利基本建设自始至终具有本地特色和贯穿效益原则。
    各地的事实表明，群众中蕴藏着一股大搞农田水利基本建设的热情；各地农民治水兴业、改变生产条件的呼声日高。现在关键在于各级领导要充分认识自己的职责，担当起组织群众的重任。国务院决定中提出：“要将农田水利基本建设搞得好坏、水利固定资产的增减，作为对各级地方政府政绩考核的重要内容”。各地应当认真贯彻执行，首先从今年秋冬开始，看看你那里农田水利基本建设搞得如何，是否卓有成效。
    兴修水利涉及各行各业、各个部门，需要协同作战。有关部门应当用实际行动支援农业，努力保证农田水利基本建设中的物资、机械、资金等的供应，积极配合水利部门做好各项工作，用实际行动为农业迅速冲出徘徊局面作出贡献！
