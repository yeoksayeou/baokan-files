	Li Peng Meets with Kibria

	Beijing, October 30 (Xinhua) - Reporter He Chongyuan reports: Premier Li Peng said today that China will continue with reform and opening up and will not close the door. Some Western countries have imposed sanctions on China, attempting to close the door. But the current difficulties are temporary. We believe that these difficulties will pass.

	Li Peng made these remarks while meeting with the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Syed Shahid Husain Kibria, at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

	Li Peng said, "We will not change our policy of reform and opening up because of the counter-revolutionary riots that occurred this spring and summer. However, some people in the West have misunderstood our reform and opening up, thinking that we want to implement a market economy and abolish public ownership, and accept Western culture." Li Peng emphasized, "Our reform and opening up is the perfection of the socialist system. Implementing a capitalist system in a country with 1.1 billion people will lead to polarization. This has been proven by history." Li Peng pointed out, "China does not want to impose its system on others; we only want to adhere to and improve our socialist system."

	Li Peng also highly praised the work done by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in promoting economic cooperation, and expressed that the Chinese government will spare no effort to support the Commission's efforts in this regard.

	Kibria said, "In economic development, each country should make decisions based on its own national conditions." He appreciated China's role in the Asia-Pacific region since the Bandung Conference and said that China's support is the source of Asia-Pacific cooperation.

　　李鹏会见基勃里亚
    本报北京10月30日讯　记者何崇元报道：国务院总理李鹏今天下午在这里说，中国将继续改革开放，不会把门关上。有些西方国家对中国实行制裁，想把门关上。但现在的困难是暂时的。我们相信困难将会过去。
    李鹏是在钓鱼台国宾馆会见联合国亚太经社会执行秘书夏·基勃里亚时讲这番话的。
    李鹏说，我们不会因今年春夏之交发生的反革命暴乱而改变改革开放的政策。但对中国的改革开放，西方的一些人误认为是要实行市场经济，要取消公有制，并接受西方的文化。李鹏强调，我们的改革开放是社会主义制度的完善。在11亿人口的大国实行资本主义制度就会两极分化。这是历史已经证明了的。李鹏指出，中国不想把自己的制度强加于他人，只是想坚持和完善自己的社会主义制度。
    李鹏还高度赞扬亚太经社会为促进经济合作所做的大量工作，表示中国政府将不遗余力地支持亚太经社会在这方面的努力。
    基勃里亚说，在经济发展中，每个国家都应根据自己的国情作出决策。他赞赏自万隆会议以来中国在亚太地区发挥的作用，称中国的支持是亚太合作的源泉。
