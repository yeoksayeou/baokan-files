Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 10th.

The fifteenth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting opened yesterday afternoon in Paris. This meeting will discuss how to further take effective measures to protect the natural environment of this continent from human activities, preserving a good environment for human survival.

According to the relevant provisions of the Antarctic Treaty, member states hold a meeting every two years to review the implementation of the treaty and make corresponding suggestions. Currently, environmental protection and ecological issues are increasingly being emphasized by the international community. If "the last pure land of mankind," the Antarctic, is polluted, it will not only affect scientific research but also have serious consequences for the global environment and ecological balance. Therefore, the environmental protection of the Antarctic continent has become an urgent issue. Another issue to be discussed at this meeting is the utilization of Antarctic resources. Beneath the ice and snow, the Antarctic continent is rich in natural resources. With the development of science and technology, humans will gradually be able to explore and develop these resources. The "Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities" adopted last year limits resource development to the minimum extent. Due to the sudden change in stance by a few countries opposing any mining activities on the Antarctic continent, this convention is estimated not to come into effect.

The 39 member countries of the Antarctic Treaty, including 22 consulting countries, participated in this meeting.

China joined the Antarctic Treaty member countries in 1983 and became a consulting country in 1985. Currently, China has two year-round scientific research stations in the Antarctic: the Changcheng Station, established in 1985, and the Zhongshan Station, established this February.

This meeting will conclude on October 20th.

    为人类生存保留美好环境
    第15届南极条约协商会议开幕
    本报巴黎10月10日电　第十五届南极条约协商会议昨天下午在巴黎开幕。这次会议将讨论如何进一步采取有效措施，保护地球上这块大陆的自然环境免遭人类活动的破坏，为人类生存保留一个美好的环境。
    根据南极条约有关规定，成员国家每两年举行一次例会，审议条约的执行情况，并相应就实施情况提出建议。目前环境保护和生态问题日益为国际社会所重视，如“人类最后一块净土”的南极被污染，不仅影响到科学研究，还将给全球的环境和生态平衡带来严重后果，因此，南极大陆的环境保护也成为一个紧迫问题。这次会议讨论的另一个问题是南极资源利用问题。冰雪覆盖下南极大陆蕴藏着丰富的自然资源。随着科技发展，人类将逐步有能力进行勘探和开发利用。去年通过的“矿产资源活动管理公约”把资源开发限制在最低限度，由于少数国家突然转变立场，反对在南极大陆的任何开采活动，这项公约估计不会最后生效。
    南极条约的39个成员国，其中22个协商国参加了这次会议。
    中国1983年加入南极条约成员国，1985年成为协商国。我国目前在南极建有两个常年科学考察站，即1985年建成的长城站和今年2月建成的中山站。
    这次会议将于本月20日闭幕。
