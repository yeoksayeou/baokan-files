North Korea Declares No Production of Nuclear Weapons

North Korea has stated that it does not produce nuclear weapons. The vice-director of the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Bang Chol-Su, said at a press conference today that the North Korean government uses nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and does not produce nuclear weapons. North Korea's development of nuclear energy is solely for peaceful purposes, serving the development of the national economy and improving the people's lives.

At the press conference held at the Pyongyang People's Culture Palace, Bang Chol-Su firmly denied the statement by the U.S. _New York Times_ quoting a senior U.S. official that North Korea has decided to produce nuclear weapons. He said that the North Korean government has repeatedly declared that North Korea advocates making the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free and peaceful zone, opposing the deployment and production of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. spreading the lie that North Korea has decided to produce nuclear weapons aims to legalize its deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea.

Bang Chol-Su introduced that the U.S. has been transporting nuclear weapons to South Korea since 1957, with over 1,000 nuclear bombs, nuclear missiles, and other nuclear weapons deployed there.

Bang Chol-Su said that mutual reconciliation and the elimination of tension are the trends of the world today. Facing North Korea, which does not possess nuclear weapons, the U.S. has no reason to deploy nuclear weapons in South Korea. The U.S. should withdraw its troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea to make the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free and peaceful zone.

　　朝鲜表示不生产核武器
    新华社平壤10月26日电  （记者张锦芳）朝鲜祖国和平统一委员会书记局副局长方哲秀今天在记者招待会上说，朝鲜政府和平利用核能，不生产核武器。朝鲜开发核能仅仅用于和平目的，即为发展国民经济和提高人民生活服务。
    在平壤人民文化宫举行的记者招待会上，方哲秀断然否认了美国《纽约时报》援引美国高级官员关于朝鲜北方已决定生产核武器的说法。他说，朝鲜政府多次申明，朝鲜北方主张使朝鲜半岛变为无核区和和平区，反对在朝鲜半岛部署和生产核武器。美国散布朝鲜决定生产核武器的谎言旨在使它在南朝鲜部署核武器合法化。
    方哲秀介绍说，美国从1957年起向南朝鲜运进核武器，至今在那里共部署核炸弹和核导弹以及其他核武器1000多枚。
    方哲秀说，相互和解和消除紧张局势是当今世界的潮流。面对不拥有核武器的朝鲜北方，美国没有任何理由在南朝鲜部署核武器。美国应当从南朝鲜撤走美军和核武器，以便使朝鲜半岛成为无核区和和平区。
