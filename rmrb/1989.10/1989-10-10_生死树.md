Visiting the Lingguang Temple in Meixian, Guangdong, before even stepping into the temple gate, two symmetrical ancient cypress trees immediately caught my eye: the one on the right was full of vitality, with thick bark and lush leaves, glowing with green light; the one on the left was completely withered, its bark peeled off, and its branches like iron. Especially the harmonious coexistence of the thriving and withered cypresses, which amazed everyone.

These two ancient cypress trees, each about three people wide and approximately 25 meters tall, are said to have been planted by the founding ancestor of Lingguang Temple, Pan Lequan. They have a history of over 1,100 years. According to the "Yinnan Mountain Records," the two ancient cypress trees were originally "tall and ancient, lush and green." In 1664, due to a lightning strike, "one suddenly withered." The locals, cherishing the fact that "the two trees were planted together, life and death inseparable," named them the "Life and Death Tree."

The "Life and Death Tree," which has endured countless calamities and stands tall with unyielding spirit, not only adds a layer of mystery to Lingguang Temple but also makes the ancient cypress itself a part of the famous sights of Yinnan. It is strictly protected by the local people. During the ten years of turmoil, a group of ignorant people saw the withered cypress as a "decayed" object and wanted to destroy it. The monks of Lingguang Temple, along with the elders and villagers from the surrounding areas, persuaded them to leave. Afterwards, a wall was built around the two cypress trees, and a sign was hung to warn against destroying the trees.

The folklore, stories, and folk songs inspired by the "Life and Death Tree" are popular in the local villages and have several versions. The most pride-inducing for the locals is the color film made a few years ago, which features mountain songs and duets. The film is titled "Life and Death Tree." When this film was released, it captivated half of eastern Guangdong.

The locals have a long history with the two cypress trees. The ancestors of Meixian came from central China. From the Qin and Han dynasties to the Eastern Jin dynasty, they experienced several wars and migrations, eventually settling in Lingnan. The two cypress trees, commonly seen in central China, naturally became companions. The "Life and Death Tree" is a witness to the changes in Meixian and a symbol of Hakka culture. Every branch and leaf exudes the charm of historical sentiment. Walking under the "Life and Death Tree," listening to the sound of the wind blowing through the cypress branches, and breathing in the air scented with cypress leaves, you can feel the subtle blend of central Chinese culture and Guangdong customs. This deepens your understanding of why this place is known as a "cultural county" and a "football county" nationwide, and it helps you recognize the patriotic poets nurtured by this land, such as Huang Zunxian and Qiu Fengjia.

    生死树
    蔡常维
    参观粤东梅县灵光寺，未跨进寺门，寺前两株对称的古柏一同扑入眼帘：右边一株生机勃勃，皮丰叶茂，碧光翠亮；左边那株完全枯死，树皮脱尽，枝杆如铁。尤其是荣枯双柏和谐协调，教人称奇不已。
    这两株足有三人合抱粗、高约25米的古柏，相传为灵光寺开山鼻祖潘了拳手植，至今已有1100多年的历史。据《阴那山志》记载，两株古柏原是“奇古参天，青葱并茂”，1664年因遭雷击，“忽枯其一”。乡人念其“两株同手植，生死不分离”，遂称为“生死树”。
    历劫倔立、风骨铮铮的“生死树”，不仅给灵光寺涂上一层神秘的色彩，而古柏本身也成了阴那胜迹的一个组成部分，受到乡民们严格的保护。十年浩劫时，一群无知者视枯柏为“腐朽”之物，欲除之而后快。灵光寺的和尚联合了四乡八村的父老兄妹，说古道今把他们“劝”下山。此后，双柏周围多了一道围墙，并挂上警戒毁树的“村规”。
    由“生死树”生发、敷演出来的民间传说、故事、唱本等口头文学，在当地乡村颇为流行，并且有好几种版本。最使乡人引为骄傲的，当数前几年拍的彩色并配有山歌对唱的故事片，片名就叫做《生死树》。当此影片公映时，竟陶醉了大半个粤东。
    乡民与双柏之间有着悠久的历史渊源。梅人祖先，始自中原，从秦汉东晋以来，几经战乱，辗转搬迁，定居岭南，两株中原常见的柏树，自然成了相依为命的伙伴。“生死树”是梅县变迁的见证，是客家风采的象征，一枝一叶散发着历史情调的魅力。漫步在“生死树”下，谛听风吹柏梢的声音，呼吸着散发出柏叶香的空气，你可以感受到那种微妙的中原风土、南粤民情混合在一起的氛围，更加深刻理解这里缘何成为全国“文化之乡”、“足球之乡”，更认识这块土地所孕育出来的黄遵宪、丘逢甲等爱国诗人……
