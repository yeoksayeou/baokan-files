The Chang Le County Committee and County Government, starting from local realities, have done several practical things for the farmers over the past year.

Organizing the masses to build water conservancy projects, solving problems that individual households cannot handle or do well. Since last winter, the entire county has organized 100,000 laborers, contributing 10 million workdays. They have built and reinforced 112 reservoirs and ponds, constructed 91 new matching pumping stations, and dug 1,531 wells and large wells. They have expanded and improved 81,000 mu of irrigated land. This year, despite a 50% reduction in rainfall and water storage compared to normal years, the 450,000 mu of wheat achieved a bumper harvest, setting a historical record.

Rectifying market order, solving the problems of difficulty in purchasing agricultural production materials, chaotic prices, and high prices. Except for the "three-in-one" fertilizers distributed according to policy, the county distributed 40,000 tons of locally produced fertilizers to households in one go, with each ton of fertilizer being 20-30 yuan cheaper than last year. For agricultural diesel, it is sold at prices approved by the pricing department, not only meeting the supply but also reducing the highest selling price by about 13% compared to the end of last year.

Rectifying the power supply team, reforming the method of collecting and paying electricity fees in rural areas, and reducing the burden on households. The county has set a unified charging standard, and the village has established an electricity fee account. Two people read the electricity meter, two people collect the electricity fee, and they go to the power supply station for verification and publish it monthly. Since this year, the electricity fee for rural households has generally decreased compared to last year.

Clearing the circulation channels, solving the problem of difficulty in selling certain agricultural and sideline products. After the spring, Chang Le County once faced the problem of "difficulty in selling pigs." The county organized forces to actively promote external sales. From January to May, the county purchased 29,863 heads of fattened pigs, 8,000 more than the same period last year. In May and June, the external shipment of 175 million jin of watermelons was obstructed. The relevant departments of the county opened up multiple channels to solve the problem of watermelon accumulation, earning farmers more than 40 million yuan.

Clearing "triangular debts." The county has cleared the old accounts of individuals owing collectives, collectives owing individuals, and collectives owing the state and external units over the past 30 years. Now, the county has cleared 11.93 million yuan (50% of the total amount). Most of the funds recovered by the collectives have been used in agricultural water conservancy construction and other public welfare projects.

　　解决最迫切的实际问题
　　昌乐县为民办事受欢迎
    山东昌乐县委、县政府从当地实际出发，去年以来，为农民办了几件实事。
    组织群众修水利，解决一家一户办不了和办不好的问题。去年冬天以来，全县组织了10万劳力，投工1000万个，新建和加固水库、塘坝112座，新建配套抽水站91座，修建机井、大口井1531眼，扩大和改善水浇地8.1万亩。今年，在降雨量和蓄水量比常年减少50％左右的情况下，45万亩小麦夺得大丰收，创历史最好水平。
    整顿市场秩序，解决农用生产资料难买、价乱、价高问题。全县除对“三挂钩”化肥按政策兑现外，把县里产的4万吨化肥一次公开分配到户，每吨化肥比去年便宜二三十元。对农用柴油，一律按物价部门核准价格出售，不仅能满足供应，而且最高售价比去年底下降13％左右。
    整顿电业队伍，改革农村电费收交办法，减轻农户负担。县里规定了统一的收费标准，村里建立电费收支帐，两人抄电表，两人收电费，并到供电站核准，按月公布。今年以来，全县农户用电的费用，普遍比去年下降。
    疏理流通渠道，解决某些农副产品销售难问题。开春后，昌乐县一度出现“卖猪难”，县里组织力量，积极外销，1月至5月，全县就收购肥猪29863头，比去年同期多收购8000头。五六月间全县1.75亿斤西瓜外调受阻，县有关部门开辟多种渠道，解决了西瓜积压的问题，使农民收入4000多万元。
    清理“三角债”。县里清理30多年来个人欠集体、集体欠个人、集体欠国家和外单位的旧帐。现在，全县已清理了1193万元（占总额的50％），集体收回的款项，大部分用在了农田水利建设和其它公共事业上。
