The sudden news of Comrade Han Qixiang's passing is deeply saddening!

Comrade Han Qixiang was a distinguished storyteller artist who emerged after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942. At the first National Congress of Literature and Art, Comrade Han Qixiang, along with Wang Zun San, was recognized as an outstanding representative and master of storytelling from the liberated areas, receiving widespread praise. In the autumn of 1953, during the second National Congress of Literature and Art, I had the fortune to meet Comrade Han Qixiang and thus became his good friend. Through long-term interactions, I was deeply moved by his deeds.

"I will sing and tell stories for the people all my life." This was not only Han Qixiang's vow but also the best reflection of his artistic practice.

Over the decades, he followed the literary direction guided by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, creating and performing for the people. Particularly noteworthy is that he always kept the vast rural areas in mind, considering it his honor to perform for the farmers. One can imagine the numerous difficulties a blind artist faces when spending years performing in mountainous rural areas. For instance, the rugged and dangerous mountain paths alone present a significant challenge. Life was also very hard, with frequent periods of hunger. However, these difficulties never daunted Comrade Han Qixiang. For decades, he persevered, dedicating countless efforts and hardships! What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people!

Han Qixiang was a pioneer in creating and performing new stories. The work of reforming storytelling in the Shan-Gan-Ning Border Region was able to proceed and achieve remarkable results, largely due to Han Qixiang's pioneering and exemplary role. Over the decades, he has always lived among the people, understanding and knowing them well. Many of his creations and performances have a strong local flavor, a strong sense of the times, and revolutionary passion, inspiring, enlightening, and motivating people. In his art, he was also bold in reforming and innovating. He not only strove to learn, refine, and use the lively and expressive language of the masses, but also worked to eliminate some clichés. In character portrayal, story structure, musical tunes, and the arrangement and use of instruments, he made many valuable creative efforts. Therefore, his performances are vigorous and refreshing, with a powerful force that moves the heart and inspires action.

Han Qixiang's diligent and hardworking spirit in learning and work is truly admirable. From an ordinary blind artist, he trained himself into an outstanding storyteller. Without a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility and dedication, without immense willpower and perseverance, achieving such brilliant results would be impossible. After learning braille, his enthusiasm for learning and working increased even more. He read many books by feeling each character with his hands, and he read so seriously. Some of his works were written in braille, one character at a time on paper, and he revised them over and over again, never tiring of the effort. He also often used a radio to listen to news, literary, and knowledge lectures to enrich his knowledge and continuously improve his ideological, theoretical, and cultural artistic qualities, fully utilizing his intelligence and talent.

Han Qixiang always maintained and carried forward the good traditions of modesty, prudence, and hard work. He had remarkable creative talent, and his new stories were highly praised by Comrade Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and other central leaders, as well as by the people's government. He also served as the vice-chairman of the Chinese Quyi Artists Association and a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Yet, he always remembered that he was a revolutionary literary and artistic worker, an ordinary Communist Party member, strictly demanding of himself, humbly learning from the masses, and from his peers. This is also the fundamental reason why he was respected by people and continuously gained artistic creativity.

Han Qixiang is indeed an artist of the people.

    深切怀念说书艺术家韩起祥
    罗扬
    忽然传来韩起祥同志逝世的噩耗，真使人感到无限哀痛！
    韩起祥同志是1942年延安文艺座谈会后涌现出来的一位卓有成就的说书艺术家。在第一次文代会上，韩起祥同志和王尊三同志一起作为解放区民间艺人的优秀代表和说书能手，受到人们的赞扬。1953年秋天，在第二次文代会期间，我有幸与韩起祥同志相识，并从此成为很好的朋友。长期的交往中，我深深地被他的事迹所感动。
    “我要为人民说唱一辈子。”这不仅是韩起祥的誓言，也是他的艺术实践的最好写照。
    几十年来，他遵循党和毛泽东同志指引的文艺方向，为人民而创作，为人民而演唱。特别值得称道的是，他心里时刻想着广大农村，把为农民说唱当作自己的光荣职责。人们可以想见，一个盲艺人长年累月深入山区农村说唱，困难是很多的。比如说，山路的崎岖、艰险，就是一个很大的困难。生活也很艰苦，饥一顿，饱一顿，是常有的事。然而这些困难从来没有难倒过韩起祥同志。他几十年如一日，不知付出多少心血，多少辛苦！这是什么精神？这就是全心全意为人民服务的精神！
    韩起祥是编演新书的闯将。陕甘宁边区改造陕北说书的工作能够开展起来，并且取得显著的成绩，一个很重要的原因，就是韩起祥起了先锋和表率作用。几十年来，他始终生活在人民中间，熟悉和了解人民。他创作和演唱的许多作品，都有着浓厚的乡土气息、强烈的时代感和革命的激情，给人们以鼓舞、启发和积极向上的力量。他在艺术上也勇于改革创新。他不但在语言上努力学习、提炼、运用活在群众中的生动活泼、有艺术表现力的语言，尽可能剔除一些陈词滥调，在人物描写、故事结构和音乐唱腔以及乐器的配置、使用等方面，也进行了许多可贵的创造性的劳动。所以，他的演唱使人感到刚健清新，具有动人心魄、催人奋进的强大力量。
    韩起祥勤奋刻苦的学习精神和工作精神，实在令人敬佩。从一个普通的盲艺人锻炼成长为一位优秀的说唱艺术家，如果没有坚强的革命责任感和事业心，如果没有极大的毅力和韧性，要取得辉煌的成就是不可能的。他学会盲文以后，学习、工作的劲头更大了。他用手一个字一个字地摸着盲文版书刊，读过许多东西，而且读得那么认真。他的作品有些是按照盲文写作的要求一个字一个字地在纸版上扎出来的，还要一遍一遍地修改，从不嫌麻烦。他还经常利用收音机收听新闻、文艺和知识讲座等节目，以丰富各方面的知识，不断提高自己的思想理论素养和文化艺术素养，把自己的聪明才智充分发挥出来。
    韩起祥始终保持和发扬了谦虚谨慎和艰苦朴素的好作风。他有惊人的创作才能，新书说得很好，曾多次受到毛泽东、朱德、周恩来等中央领导同志的称赞和人民政府的表扬，他还担任中国曲艺家协会副主席、全国政协委员等职务；而他却牢牢记住自己是一个革命文艺工作者，是一个普通共产党员，时时处处严格要求自己，虚心向群众学习，向同行们学习，这也是他能够受到人们的尊重并不断获得艺术创造源泉的根本原因。
    韩起祥不愧是人民的艺术家。
