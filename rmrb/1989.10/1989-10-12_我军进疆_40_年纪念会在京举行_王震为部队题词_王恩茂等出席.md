The 40th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army's entry into Xinjiang was held in Beijing today. Forty years ago today, the PLA marched into Xinjiang, planting the banner of victory across the Tian Shan mountains.

Vice President Wang Zhen inscribed a calligraphy for the heroic troops: "The glorious deeds of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army will be passed down from generation to generation." Wang Enmao, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and other veteran generals who led the troops into Xinjiang attended the commemorative meeting. Wang Enmao highly praised the glorious achievements of the troops at the meeting.

On the eve of national liberation, a unit that had gained fame for defending Yan'an marched westward under the leadership of General Wang Zhen. They crossed icy rivers, traversed the Gobi Desert, scaled the millennia-old snow-capped mountains, and traversed the "Sea of Death," the Taklamakan Desert, liberating the vast expanse of Xinjiang. Since then, millions of soldiers have been stationed in the northwest for 40 years, working with the local people of various ethnic groups to transform the land, creating oases in the desert.

In the 1950s, the unit cleared land and produced goods, living frugally to contribute to the development and construction of the border regions. In the 1960s, the unit participated in the famous Sino-Indian Self-Defense Counterattack, bravely defending the country and the borders, producing heroes like Luo Guangxian, who became nationally renowned. In the 1970s, the unit participated in the first live-fire exercise under nuclear conditions in the history of the PLA, accumulating valuable experience for the modernization of national defense. In the 1980s, the unit ascended the vast Kunlun Mountains three times, completing a large-scale three-year border defense construction project in the ice and snow, further consolidating the country's borders and receiving praise and affection from people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. They were hailed as the steel pillars for defending and building the borders.

    我军进疆40年纪念会在京举行
    王震为部队题词　王恩茂等出席
    新华社北京10月11日电　（记者陈湘安）中国人民解放军进军新疆40周年纪念会今天在京举行。40年前的今天，人民解放军开进新疆，把胜利的旗帜插遍了天山南北。
    国家副主席王震为这支英雄的部队题词：中国工农红军光荣事迹代代传。全国政协副主席王恩茂等一批当年率部进疆的老将军出席了纪念会。王恩茂在会上高度赞扬了这支部队的光辉业绩。
    全国解放前夕，一支在保卫延安中威名远扬的部队，挥师西进，在王震将军率领下，涉冰河、跨戈壁，翻越千年雪山，横穿“死亡之海”塔克拉玛干大沙漠，解放了地域辽阔的新疆大地。从此，千万名将士在大西北驻守40年，和当地各族人民一起改天换地，在戈壁滩上营造出片片绿洲。50年代，这支部队开荒生产，节衣缩食，为开发建设边疆立下汗马功劳；60年代，这支部队参加了著名的中印自卫反击战，英勇卫国戍边，涌现出罗光燮等一批全国知名的战斗英雄；70年代，这支部队参加了我军第一次原子条件下的实弹实兵演习，为国防现代化建设积累了宝贵经验；80年代，这支部队三上莽莽昆仑，在冰原雪岭完成了规模宏大的三年边防建设，为巩固祖国边防再立新功，受到全疆各族人民的称颂和爱戴，被誉为保卫边疆、建设边疆的钢铁柱石。
