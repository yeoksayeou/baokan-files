The longest highway bridge over the Minjiang River—the Leshan Bridge—was completed and opened to traffic seven months ahead of schedule on October 1st.

The Leshan Bridge, which is 666.9 meters long and 15 meters wide, is located north of Leshan City, Sichuan, about four kilometers from the world's largest Buddha statue. The bridge, along with its supporting facilities, has an investment of 18 million yuan and was constructed by the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. The original construction period was two years, but it was completed in just 17 months. The opening of the Leshan Bridge will play an important role in alleviating the traffic congestion in Sichuan, as well as in developing the local economy and tourism industry.
