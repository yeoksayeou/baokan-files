The long, quiet afternoons, with the sun shining on the shop windows, and the streets deserted. The narrow, filthy workshops, where workers toil anxiously. Under the shadow of poverty, people lead a dull, joyless life. This is the scene of the five pottery towns in North Staffordshire, as depicted by the realist writer Arnold Bennett (1867–1931).

Bennett was born in this county. He studied at the University of London, worked as a clerk in a law firm, and later served as an editor for the magazine *Women*. In 1900, after the publication of his first novel *The Man from the North*, he began his writing career. His most outstanding works are set in his hometown, the five pottery towns, including *Anna of the Five Towns* (1902), *The Old Wives' Tale* (1908), and the Clayhanger trilogy: *Clayhanger* (1910), *Hilda Lessways* (1911), and *These Twain* (1916). With a passionate pen and deep sympathy, he vividly portrayed the lives of the working class and the lower strata of society in this region, reflecting their hardships and setbacks. Among these, *The Old Wives' Tale* is Bennett's masterpiece, recounting the tumultuous lives of two sisters. This book is generally regarded by literary historians as a classic of British realism. *The Card* (1923) is another masterpiece set in this region, describing how a miser (an old bookseller) starves himself to death. His wife, influenced by him, also becomes miserly and meets an unfortunate end.

Bennett was influenced by Balzac and Flaubert, and his character portrayals are meticulous. He dedicated his life to depicting his hometown, becoming an outstanding regional writer with international renown.

Bennett wrote nearly a hundred books in his lifetime, including 30 novels, multiple volumes of short stories, 13 plays, and several collections of essays. He also frequently wrote literary critiques for London newspapers, significantly influencing British literature. Whenever his articles were published, many publishers would send people to the newspaper office to eagerly purchase the newly printed issues containing his work.

Bennett has been gone for over half a century, but the British public still deeply misses this talented writer. Many bookstores have reprinted his major works.

　　英国乡土作家本奈特
　　申奥
    悠长冷寂的下午，太阳照在商店的橱窗上，街道是空荡荡的。狭小污秽的作坊里，工人们紧张地劳动着。在贫困的魔影笼罩下，人们过着呆滞的没有丝毫乐趣的生活。这是现实主义作家阿诺德·本奈特（1867——1931）笔下的英国北斯塔福德郡五个陶业小镇的情景。
    本奈特就出生在这个郡，他在伦敦大学念过书，曾在一家律师事务所当职员，后来在《妇女》杂志任编辑。1900年他的第一部小说《来自北方的人》发表后，便开始了写作生涯。他最优秀的作品都是写他的家乡五个陶业小镇的，包括《五镇的安娜》（1902）、《老妇人的故事》（1908）和克勒汉格尔家族三部曲，即：《克勒汉格尔》（1910）、《希尔达莱士威》（1911）、《成双成对》（1916）。他用饱含热情的笔触，怀着深刻的同情，录象般地描绘了这一地区工人阶级和下层人民的生活，反映了他们的苦难和遭受的挫折。其中《老妇人的故事》是本奈特的代表作，它记述了截然不同的两姊妹的坎坷一生。这本书被一般文学史家列为英国现实主义的经典著作。《莱思曼台阶》（1923）是以本地区为背景的另一杰作，它描述一个守财奴（旧书商人）怎样把自己活活饿死。他的老婆受到他的影响爱财如命，结果也不得善终。
    本奈特师承巴尔扎克和福楼拜，刻画人物细致入微。他终生孜孜不倦地反映家乡生活，是一个卓越的乡土作家，在国际上享有盛誉。
    本奈特一生写了近百部书，其中有长篇小说30部，短篇小说多卷，13个剧本以及一些论文集等等。他还经常在伦敦报纸上撰写文学评论，对英国文学产生了较大影响，每当他的文章发表的那天，许多出版社都派人到报馆鹄望，争相购买刚刚出版的刊有他的文章的报纸。
    本奈特逝世已经半个多世纪了，英国公众仍然深深怀念这位才华横溢的作家，许多书店都重印了他的主要著作。
