	Four Generals from Chengdu Military Region Visit Thousand-Mile Border Defense Line
	Help the Grassroots Solve Problems, Warm the Hearts of Soldiers, and Set an Example for Subordinates

	People's Daily reports: Over the past month, General Fu Quanyou of the Chengdu Military Region, along with Deputy Chief of Staff Wei Zhaosheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department Zheng Xianbin, and Director of the Logistics Department Wang Shilin, led a work team to visit the frontlines of the Tibetan border, conducting investigations and research, and providing comfort to the troops. They helped the border defense troops solve practical difficulties, which has had a strong impact.

	From the end of July to September this year, the four generals traveled along the Himalayas, from the western to the eastern lines, and from the southern to the northern lines, covering a total distance of over 10,000 miles. They inspected 82 units, including military, division, brigade, regiment, battalion, company, platoon, and squad levels. The generals visited a certain regiment at the westernmost end of the military region's defense line, at an altitude of over 4,500 meters, where the environment is extremely harsh and oxygen is severely lacking. They also visited the Nai Dula outpost, the Cuola area, the Naqu area, and braved the August blizzards to cross mountains over 5,500 meters high and steep gorges. They spent the night at the "life-and-death line" of 500 meters, reaching the "national gate" outpost on the Sino-Nepal border. At each stop, the generals carefully understood the actual difficulties faced by the border defense troops. For issues such as personnel allocation, funding, vehicles, housing, family members, and children, as well as political materials, winter supplies, communication equipment, cultural activities, and production operations, they resolved what could be solved on the spot, made specific arrangements for others, and instructed the work team to classify and organize the issues for further study and resolution upon their return to the military region. To ensure that the border defense troops have better living and working conditions, the generals also organized an on-site meeting for the comprehensive improvement of the camp area, setting the standards of "high quality, high speed, low consumption, and safety."

	The four generals from the Chengdu Military Region visited the frontlines of the Tibetan border, personally experiencing the hardships of the border soldiers. They required the work team to use the construction of the border defense troops as a mirror, checking and improving the work style and methods of the headquarters. The generals and the work team extensively listened to the opinions, demands, and suggestions of the headquarters and grassroots units stationed in Tibet regarding the military region's headquarters. They identified existing problems and clarified the direction for the next steps in strengthening border defense and grassroots units. Through visits and comfort, they further strengthened the relationship between the Party, government, military, police, and civilians, enhancing military-political and military-civilian unity, as well as national unity.

    成都军区4将军走访千里边防线
    帮基层解难　给勇士送暖　为下属示范
    本报讯　近一个多月以来，成都军区司令员傅全有中将、副参谋长魏兆生少将、政治部副主任郑贤斌少将、后勤部部长王世麟少将等四位将军率领工作组，深入西藏边防一线调查研究、慰问部队，帮助边防部队解决一些实际困难，引起强烈反响。
    从今年7月底到9月，四位将军沿着喜马拉雅山麓，由西线到东线，由南线到北线，总共行程一万多里，调查了军、师、旅、团、营、连、排、班单位82个。四位将军到了海拔4500米以上、严重缺氧、环境异常艰苦、军区防线最西端的边防某团及乃堆拉阵地、错拉地区、那曲地区，并冒着八月暴风雪，翻越海拔5500米的高山和陡峭峡谷，夜过500米“生死线”，直到中尼边境前哨“国门班”。每到一地，将军们都认真了解边防一线部队官兵的实际困难，对部队提出的编制、经费、车子、房子、妻子、孩子问题，以及政治教材、过冬物资、通信设备、文化生活、生产经营等问题，有的能解决的即现场解决，有的作了具体部署，有的指示工作组分类整理回军区统一研究后再解决。为了让边防一线部队能有一个比较好的住宿、生活条件，将军们还就地组织召开了营区综合治理现场会，提出了“优质、高速、低耗、安全”的要求。
    成都军区四位将军深入西藏边防一线，亲身体验了边防战士的疾苦，要求工作组以边防部队建设为镜子，对照检查机关自身的工作作风和工作方法。四位将军及工作组广泛听取了驻藏部队机关、基层对军区机关的意见、要求和建议，找到了存在的问题，明确了下一步抓边防、抓基层的努力方向。同时，通过走访慰问，进一步密切了党政军警民之间的关系，加强了军政军民团结和民族团结。
