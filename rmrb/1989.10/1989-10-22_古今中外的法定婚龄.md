Legal marriage age refers to the minimum age at which men and women can legally marry, not the age at which they must marry or the maximum age for marriage. This is the case in marriage and family laws of all countries. If there is an exception, it is only the fourth article of the old Russian civil code, which states: "Those over 80 years old, whether male or female, cannot marry."

In China, the practice of early marriage, which has persisted for over 3,000 years, has been a significant social problem. Therefore, opposing early marriage has been a consistent policy of our Party. During the democratic revolution period, our Party abolished the practice of early marriage in the marriage and family laws of the revolutionary base areas and promoted late marriage. For example, the "Marriage Regulations of the Chinese Soviet Republic" and the "Marriage Regulations of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" all set the marriage age at 20 for men and 18 for women. These regulations could only be implemented in the revolutionary base areas under the historical conditions at that time. For the entire country, the marriage age stipulated by the civil law of the Kuomintang, which was 18 for men and 16 for women, remained in effect.

In 1950, the first important law after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Marriage Law, was promulgated, setting the legal marriage age at 20 for men and 18 for women. The new Marriage Law promulgated in 1980 raised the legal marriage age to 22 for men and 20 for women, and also encouraged late marriage and late childbearing.

The legal marriage ages stipulated by various countries around the world, although they vary in height, generally show a trend of being lower in ancient times and gradually increasing in modern times. For example, the earliest legal marriage age in ancient Britain was 14 for men and 12 for women. The Marriage Laws of 1929 and 1949 stipulated that men and women could marry at the age of 16. The Revised Family Law of 1969 stipulated that the marriage age for men and women was 18. Although modern countries have generally raised the legal marriage age, due to differences in political, economic conditions, customs, and habits, the legal marriage ages also vary. Specifically, the highest is in countries like Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and some states in the United States, which stipulate 21 for men and 18 for women; the lowest is in countries like Spain, Argentina, and Greece, which stipulate 14 for men and 12 for women.

### 古今中外的法定婚龄

　　古今中外的法定婚龄
    所谓法定婚龄就是法律规定男女可以结婚的最低年龄，而不是必须结婚或最高的结婚年龄。各国的婚姻家庭立法均是如此，如果说有例外，那也只有一个，即旧沙俄民法典第四条规定：“年逾80，男女不得结婚。”
    在我国，延续3000多年的早婚陋习，可谓是社会的一大公害。因而反对早婚便成为我党的一贯政策。早在民主革命时期，我党在革命根据地的婚姻家庭立法中，就废除了早婚陋习，提倡晚婚。如《中华苏维埃共和国婚姻条例》、《陕甘宁边区婚姻条例》等均以男20岁，女18岁为结婚年龄。这些规定，在当时的历史条件下，只能在革命根据地施行，就全国范围来讲，实行的仍是国民党颁布的民法亲属编所规定的男18，女16的法定婚龄。
    1950年，颁布了建国后第一部重要法律——婚姻法，将法定婚龄定为男20岁，女18岁。1980年颁布的新婚姻法又将法定婚龄提高为男22岁，女20岁，而且鼓励晚婚晚育。
    世界各国法定婚龄的规定，虽有高低差异，但总的发展变化趋势是，古代偏低，近现代逐渐升高。如古代英国最早规定的法定婚龄为男14岁，女12岁，1929年和1949年《婚姻法》规定男女各满16岁可以结婚，1969年的《修订家庭法》规定男女结婚年龄为18岁。近现代各国虽都提高了法定婚龄，但由于各国的政治、经济条件及风俗、习惯等因素的差异，法定婚龄也各有高低。从具体规定看，最高的如丹麦、芬兰、瑞典、美国部分州等规定为男21岁，女18岁；最低的如西班牙、阿根廷、希腊等国规定为男14岁，女12岁。
