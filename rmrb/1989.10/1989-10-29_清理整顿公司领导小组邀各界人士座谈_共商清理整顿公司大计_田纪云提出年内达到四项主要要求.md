The Company Rectification and Cleanup Leading Group invited representatives from various circles, including members of the National People's Congress (NPC) inspection and supervision teams, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) members, and members of various democratic parties, to a symposium to discuss how to improve the company rectification and cleanup work.

Vice Premier and Director of the National Company Rectification and Cleanup Leading Group, Tian Jiyun, said at the symposium that the company rectification and cleanup work has now entered a critical stage, with heavy tasks, tight schedules, and great difficulties. The progress of the work is not ideal, and if decisive measures are not taken, it will be difficult to achieve the expected goals, especially in the areas of company mergers and acquisitions and the investigation of major cases, which are even more challenging and require great effort.

He pointed out that the main requirements for the company rectification and cleanup work this year are as follows:

1. Strictly implement the regulations of the Central Committee, the State Council, and other relevant documents. Decisively merge and acquire a number of companies, and properly handle the aftermath of company mergers and acquisitions. Specifically, this includes the cleanup of assets, debts, and liabilities, the handover and coordination of business and contracts, the arrangement of personnel, and the handling of illegal and disciplinary cases.

2. Concentrate on investigating and dealing with a number of serious illegal and disciplinary issues and cases, with a focus on major cases, and use this to promote the in-depth development of the company rectification and cleanup work.

3. Begin drafting various management regulations and systems for companies. Currently, the focus should be on formulating solutions for several issues of great concern to the public, such as adjusting company salaries and welfare benefits, cleaning up company tax exemptions, and defining company operating scopes.

4. Strengthen organizational leadership and reinforce the staff of the working bodies. The main leaders of various regions and departments must take full responsibility.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Peng Chong, said that inviting NPC, CPPCC, and democratic party members to participate in this work itself shows the Central Committee and the State Council's attention and determination to this work. He emphasized that the first step is to address the issue of resolve. All parties must be determined to work together to get this job done. It must be seen through to the end, and there can be no half-hearted efforts or breaking of promises to the people. He stressed that the company rectification and cleanup must be conducted in accordance with the law. When dealing with economic illegal cases, there is now a legal basis, and efforts must be made to change the phenomenon of "punishment instead of criminal prosecution" that exists in some places.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Qian Zhengying, emphasized that the company rectification and cleanup should be analyzed concretely, with a focus on breaking through key areas, dissecting typical cases, and using them to promote the in-depth development of the work. Qian Min, Qin Chuan, Zhou Yu, Lin Lanying, and Jing Shuping also spoke at the symposium.

This time, a total of 64 NPC, CPPCC, and democratic party members participated in the company rectification and cleanup inspection and supervision teams, including 15 NPC Standing Committee members, 2 CPPCC Standing Committee members, 6 vice chairmen of democratic parties, and many renowned experts and scholars. Those invited to the symposium also included: Vice Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, Song Kun; Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Wu Jing; Vice Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Yu Zeyou; Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Bai Dahua; Member of the China Democratic League, Jin Liangchao; Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, Yao Jun; Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Wang Songda; Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, Xu Caideng; Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Xu Mengshan; Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Jing Shuping, and others.

　　清理整顿公司领导小组邀各界人士座谈
　　共商清理整顿公司大计
　　田纪云提出年内达到四项主要要求
    本报北京10月28日讯　记者潘岗报道：全国清理整顿公司领导小组今天邀请参加清理整顿公司巡视组、检查组工作的全国人大代表、政协委员、各民主党派人士举行座谈会，共商搞好清理整顿公司的工作。
    国务院副总理、全国清理整顿公司领导小组组长田纪云在座谈会上说，目前清理整顿公司工作已经进入到关键阶段，任务重，时间紧，难度大。现在整个工作的进展还不理想，如不采取坚决措施，很难达到预期目的，特别是撤并公司和查处大案要案工作，难度更大，必须下大气力抓。这次邀请全国人大代表、全国政协委员、各民主党派成员对清理公司工作进行监督、检查、指导，不仅具有十分重要的政治、社会意义，而且可以使人民群众和社会各界对这项工作的关切和要求直接得到反映和体现，必将推动整个工作深入进行。
    他指出，今年内清理整顿公司工作的主要要求是：（1）严格执行中央、国务院和其他有关文件规定，坚决撤并一批公司，并认真做好公司撤并的善后事宜，切实做好资产、债权、债务的清理，业务、合同的交接和衔接，人员的安排，违法违纪案件的处理等四项工作。（2）集中查处一批严重违法违纪的问题和案件，重点是大案要案，并以此推动整个清理整顿公司工作深入开展。（3）着手公司各项管理法规和制度的拟定工作。目前要先把公司的工资和福利待遇的调整、公司减免税的清理、公司经营范围的确定等几个群众最关心的问题制定出办法来。
  （4）加强组织领导，充实办事机构的力量，各地区、各部门主要领导要切实负起责任来。
    全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲说，邀请人大、政协、各民主党派成员参加这项工作，本身就说明中央、国务院对这项工作的重视和决心。他说，首先是要解决决心问题。各方面下决心，共同把这件事情搞好。要一抓到底，不能虎头蛇尾，不能失信于民。他强调，清理整顿公司要依法办事。查处经济违法案件，现在是有法可依，要下决心改变有些地方存在的“以罚代刑”现象。
    全国政协副主席钱正英强调，清理整顿公司要具体分析，重点突破，解剖典型，以点带面，推动工作深入开展。钱敏、秦川、邹瑜、林兰英、经叔平等也在座谈会上先后发言。
    这次全国人大、全国政协和各民主党派共有64位同志参加清理整顿公司巡视组、检查组工作，其中有15位人大常委、2位政协常委、6位民主党派的副主席，以及许多有声望的专家、学者。应邀参加座谈会的还有：中央统战部副部长宋堃、民革中央常委吴京、民盟中央副秘书长俞泽猷、民建中央副主席白大华、民进委员金良超、农工民主党中央副主席姚竣、致公党中央副主席王宋大、九三学社中央副主席徐采栋、台盟中央评议委员会委员徐萌山、全国工商联副主席经叔平等。
