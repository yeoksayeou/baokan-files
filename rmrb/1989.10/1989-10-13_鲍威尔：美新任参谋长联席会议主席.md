President Bush has appointed the 52-year-old Army General Colin Powell to succeed the retiring Admiral William Crowe as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He officially took office on October 1st. Powell is the youngest Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in U.S. military history and the first African American to hold this position. He is also one of the few to hold this position without having attended a military academy.

Powell is the son of Jamaican immigrants and graduated from the City University of New York. In 1958, Powell enlisted in the Army in the South Bronx of New York City. From 1962 to 1968, he served in Vietnam, was wounded twice, and successively held positions as a battalion commander, brigade commander, commander of the U.S. Fifth Corps in West Germany, and commander of McPherson Barracks. He is the fourth African American to reach the rank of four-star general in the U.S. military. In 1972, Powell was recognized by his superiors as a promising young officer and was first selected to enter the White House. Subsequently, he frequently moved in and out of the Pentagon and also held civilian positions. In 1986, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger chose Powell, who was then working in the Pentagon, to be his military advisor. In 1986, President Reagan included him in the National Security Council. Powell requested to retain his military rank in the Army to continue his career as a professional soldier, thus having the opportunity to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His request was approved by Reagan. In November 1987, National Security Advisor Frank Carlucci became the Secretary of Defense, and Powell took over his former position. After the Iran-Contra affair, Powell played a significant role in the reconstruction of the National Security Council. It was during the Reagan administration that Powell came closer to his goal of becoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Powell's colleagues say he has a strong sense of racial identity. In the Pentagon, he pays special attention to the promotion of black officers. During the last presidential election, Powell was an unofficial advisor to Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson's campaign team, but this did not affect his loyalty to Reagan's National Security Council.

Some people believe that Powell lacks experience in commanding combat troops for an extended period. However, it is generally believed that the role of the President's chief military advisor requires more diplomatic experience, in which Powell excels. Therefore, some people think he also has the potential to become a star in President Bush's diplomatic team. Those who praise Powell say his strengths lie in his calm and practical demeanor, humility, deep understanding of how the U.S. government operates, and strong organizational skills. Additionally, he is a typical soldier who does not meddle much in politics. President Bush described Powell as a "true soldier."

    鲍威尔：美新任参谋长联席会议主席
    布什总统已任命五十二岁的陆军上将鲍威尔接替将退休的克劳海军上将担任参谋长联席会议主席。他已于十月一日开始正式上任。鲍威尔是美军历史上最年轻的参谋长联席会议主席，也是第一个担任这一职务的黑人。他还是少数担任该职务而没有经过军校培养的人之一。
    鲍威尔是牙买加移民后裔，毕业于纽约城市大学。一九五八年，鲍在纽约市南布兰克斯区参加陆军。一九六二至一九六八年，他在越南服役，受过二次伤，先后担任步兵营营长、空降旅旅长、驻西德美军第五军团指挥官、麦克弗森要塞司令。他是美国三军中第四位黑人四星将领。一九七二年，鲍受到上司赏识，作为很有发展前途的青年被首次推选进白宫。尔后几进几出五角大楼，还担任过文职工作。一九八六年，国防部长温伯格挑选当时在五角大楼工作的鲍威尔担任他的军事顾问。一九八六年，里根总统让他加入国家安全会议。鲍威尔请求保留他在陆军的军衔，以便继续沿着职业军人的道路发展，这样才有希望达到他的最终目标——参谋长联席会议主席。他的请求得到了里根的批准。一九八七年十一月，国家安全顾问卡卢奇出任国防部长，鲍接替了卡的原职。“伊朗门”丑闻后，在国家安全会议重建的过程中，鲍起了很重要的作用。正是里根时期，使鲍更接近了当参谋长联席会议主席的目标。
    鲍威尔的同事说他具有较强的民族意识。在五角大楼，他很注意黑人军官的提升。上次总统竞选期间，鲍威尔是民主党黑人候选人杰西·杰克逊竞选班子的非正式顾问，可这并不影响他忠于里根的国家安全会议。
    有人认为，鲍欠缺长期统率战斗部队的经验。不过，一般认为，担任总统的首席军事顾问，更需要的是外交经验，鲍威尔在这方面却具有特长，所以有人认为他也有希望成为布什总统外交班子中的明星。赞扬鲍威尔的人说，他的优点在于冷静务实、为人谦虚、对于美国政府如何运转有深入的了解，具有很强的组织能力。另外，他是典型的军人，不太过问政治。布什总统称鲍威尔是“真正的军人”。
