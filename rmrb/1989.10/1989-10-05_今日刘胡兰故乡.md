Year after year, tens of thousands of people come to the hometown of the female hero Liu Huilan—Yunzhouxi Village in Wenxian County, Shanxi Province—to visit the Liu Huilan Memorial Hall.

The large willow tree with two main branches on the west side of the Guanyin Temple still stands tall. On January 12, 1947, under this large willow tree, 15-year-old Liu Huilan and six other captured peasants, filled with hatred, bravely sacrificed their lives under the enemy's guillotine.

The land once stained with the blood of the martyrs now blooms with lush flowers. The once-poor village with only one small street has now become the prosperous Liu Huilan Town.

The town mayor told the reporter that over the past 40 years since liberation, the town's total industrial and agricultural income has increased from 130,000 yuan to 2.1 million yuan in 1988. Per capita income has risen from 48 yuan to 560 yuan. Additionally, there are 35 tractors of various sizes, 8 trucks, 20 workshops, and 6 township enterprises. The town also has primary, middle, and high schools.

The Liu Huilan family has built a new residence opposite the old house. In the courtyard with peach, plum, and grape trees, Liu Huilan's sister-in-law Bai Yunxian warmly received us. This commander of the Liu Huilan militia squad said that Huilan's father and mother passed away a few years ago. Her brothers Liu Jile and Liu Jiying, and sisters Liu Zhilan and Liu Ailan, have all grown up under the Party's nurturing to become state cadres. They, like many young people who have taken oaths in front of Liu Huilan's statue, are adding bricks and tiles to the people's republic.

    今日刘胡兰故乡
    本报记者　纪希晨
    年年岁岁，成千上万的人来到女英雄刘胡兰的故乡——山西省文水县云周西村刘胡兰纪念馆参观。
    该村观音庙西侧的那棵双杈大柳树仍巍然挺立。1947年1月12日，在这株大柳树下，15岁的刘胡兰和同时被捕的6位农民，怀着满腔的仇恨，在敌人铡刀下英勇就义。
    昔日烈士血染的土地，今日开放了茂盛的花朵。原来只有一条小街的贫穷村庄，现在成了日益繁荣的刘胡兰镇。
    镇长告诉记者，解放40年来，全镇工农业总收入由13万元增至1988年的210万元，人均收入由48元增至560元。另有35台大小拖拉机、8辆汽车、20家作坊和6家乡镇企业。镇内还有小学、初中和高中。
    刘胡兰家已在旧宅对面建起新居。在种有桃、李、葡萄的庭院里，刘胡兰的弟媳白云仙热情接待我们。这位刘胡兰民兵班的班长说，胡兰姐的父亲、母亲前几年去世，弟弟刘继烈、刘继英、妹妹刘芝兰、刘爱兰，都在党的培养下成长为国家干部。他们像许多在刘胡兰雕像前宣过誓的青少年一样，正为人民的共和国添砖加瓦。
