On October 6, at the Beijing shooting range, Asian archery champions were competing, and Xu KaiCai, the head coach of China's archery team, frequently observed the targets through a telescope. One year from this day, the Asian Games archery competition will determine the winner on the same field, but he currently lacks confidence in his team members. It is clear that in Asia, there are more than just the South Korean team that can defeat China's team; Japan, Indonesia, Chinese Taipei, India, and other teams all have the strength to compete with us.

Three years ago, China's women's archery team could be considered on par with the South Korean team, but now the gap is obvious. The South Korean team dominates the world, and their advanced training methods make them victorious in every battle.

Li ShuLan, a coach who once trained world champion Ma XiangJun, frankly said, "We still have not figured out the rules of archery, so our training methods and means are outdated."

The South Korean women's team that came to compete this time is mostly new, but they still easily won the championship. Their coach said that South Korean athletes do not get nervous in international competitions and rely on their technical advantages to steadily win championships, but in domestic competitions, it is different; there are many strong players, making it difficult to win. We also had world-class athletes, but there are few elite players, and they are only briefly successful. Ma XiangJun retired and got married at the peak of her technical prowess. Before this competition, Xu KaiCai specially went to Qingdao to persuade Ma XiangJun, who already has a child, to return to the team for training and prepare for the Asian Games. However, he could not meet her various conditions. Foreign coaches and athletes are very envious of our world-class training facilities, but unfortunately, these top facilities have not produced more top athletes, which makes one wonder if Ma XiangJun's success was accidental.

During the competition, the coaches of various teams exchanged ideas and were open with each other. It is understood that world-class athletes begin archery training around the age of 10, with basic training lasting 5 hours a day. Chinese archery athletes usually start training at 15 years old, with only 1 hour of basic technical training per day. The South Korean team uses infrared and laser technology to test the rationality of basic postures, aiming, and other actions, and also conducts quantitative analysis. Chinese coaches mainly rely on observation and intuition for qualitative analysis. In this competition, each group shot three arrows, and South Korean athletes often finished first, with quick and powerful movements. Xu KaiCai summarized their technical characteristics as fixing the posture while pulling the bow, aiming while pulling the bow, and releasing while aiming, with the three links closely combined and completed in one breath.

The Chinese team has not solved the problem of the three links being disconnected in recent years. Female athlete Yao YaWen said, "Our movements are large and unstable." Chinese athletes often raise the bow and then put it down, hesitating, adding to their psychological burden.

Although this competition objectively provided Asian powers with an opportunity to practice for the Asian Games, the benefits it left for the Chinese team may be even greater. Xu KaiCai spent more than half of his energy during the competition observing the technical characteristics of various teams and finding his own shortcomings. He has decided to focus on the stability of technical movements and, as much as possible, use scientific research to provide a scientific basis for training, striving to make this ancient sport, which has been highly valued since the Zhou Dynasty, regain its historical glory.

    鹿死他手何心甘
    ——浅析中国射箭队与世界强队的技术差距
    本报记者　李北大
    10月6日，北京射击场，亚洲射箭好手正在比赛中，中国射箭队总教练徐开才手举望远镜频频注视箭靶。一年后的这一天，亚运会射箭赛将要在同一块场地上决定胜负，而眼下他对自己的队员尚无信心。明摆着，在亚洲能够战胜中国队的已不止南朝鲜队一家，日本、印度尼西亚、中国台北、印度等队均有实力与我们对抗。
    三年前，中国女子射箭队与南朝鲜队可以说不分伯仲，而今差距很明显。南朝鲜队称雄世界，先进的训练方法使他们屡战屡胜。
    曾培养出世界冠军马湘君的中国队教练李淑兰坦率地说，“我们至今没有摸透射箭运动的规律，因此，训练方法和手段落后了。”
    此次来参赛的南朝鲜女队多半是新手，但仍然轻取桂冠。她们的教练说，南朝鲜选手打国际比赛不紧张，凭着技术优势稳拿冠军，而在家比赛则不同，强手如林，反倒难以取胜。我们也曾有过世界级选手，可是尖子不多，昙花一现。马湘君正当技术顶峰时期退役结婚，这次比赛前，徐开才专程前往青岛，动员已有小孩的马湘君归队训练，迎接亚运会，然而无法满足她提出的若干条件。外国教练员和运动员非常羡慕我们具有世界一流的训练场地，可惜一流设施并没有培养出更多的一流选手，这不能不使人怀疑马湘君的成功是否带有偶然性。
    比赛期间，各队教练相互交流，坦诚相见。据了解，世界优秀选手开始进行射箭训练在10岁左右，每天基本功训练长达5个小时，中国射箭选手多从15岁练起，每天基本技术训练只有1小时。南朝鲜队训练中运用红外线和激光测试基本姿势、瞄准等动作的合理性，而且进行定量分析。中国队教练员主要靠观察、凭感觉进行定性分析。这次比赛每一组三支箭，南朝鲜选手常常最先射完，动作短捷有力。徐开才归纳其技术特点是固定姿势中拉弓，拉弓中瞄准，瞄准中撒放，三个环节紧密结合，一气呵成。
    中国队几年来没有解决好三个环节脱节的弊病。女队员姚雅文说，我们动作幅度大，不稳定。中国队员常常是举起弓又放下，犹犹豫豫，给自己增加心理负担。
    这次比赛虽然客观上给亚洲诸强提供了亚运会实地演练机会，但给中国队留下的好处也许更多。徐开才在比赛期间，拿出一半以上的精力观察各队技术特点，寻找自己的不足。他拿定主意，重点抓技术动作的稳定性，尽可能借助科研力量为训练提供科学依据，力争使我国这项自周代起就受到极大重视的古老运动重现历史的光辉。
