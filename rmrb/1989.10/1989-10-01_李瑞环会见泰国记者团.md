Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, met with a delegation of Thai journalists led by He Yun, editor-in-chief of the Thai Chinese-language newspaper *Xin Zhongyuan Bao*, today in Zhongnanhai. He said that yesterday, Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, delivered an important report, pointing out the direction and goals for China's future work and providing a comprehensive explanation of issues that everyone is concerned about.

When discussing the construction of a clean government, Li Ruihuan said that building a clean government is a complex issue. Overcoming bureaucratism and negative phenomena that have emerged with reform and opening up is not just a matter of simple resolve and attitude; it also involves studying and determining how to address these issues.

He said that it must be acknowledged that the Party and the government are generally good, and the vast majority of cadres are honest and diligent in serving the people. To label most cadres as corrupt is not only contrary to the facts but also detrimental to the effort to overcome the few instances of corruption.

Li Ruihuan also briefed the Thai journalists on the situation regarding the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot and answered their questions.

The Thai journalists' delegation came to China at the invitation of the *People's Daily* to conduct interviews and participate in National Day celebrations.

    李瑞环会见泰国记者团
    新华社北京9月30日电  中共中央政治局常委李瑞环今天在中南海会见由泰国华文报《新中原报》总编辑何韵女士率领的泰国记者团时说，昨天江泽民总书记代表党中央和国务院作了重要报告，指出了中国今后工作的方向和目标，对大家关心的问题作了全面的阐述。在谈到廉政建设时，李瑞环说，廉政建设是一个复杂的问题。克服官僚风气和伴随改革开放而出现的消极现象，不仅仅是一个简单的决心与态度问题，还有一个研究探讨，决定怎么办的问题。
    他说，必须肯定党和政府在总体上是好的，绝大多数干部是清廉的，是兢兢业业为群众办事的。把多数干部说成是腐败的，既不符合事实，也不利于克服少数腐败现象。
    李瑞环还向泰国记者介绍了平息反革命暴乱的情况并回答了他们的问题。
    泰国记者团是应《人民日报》的邀请前来采访和参加国庆活动的。
