The Asian Cup archery competition began in the rain

China's newcomers perform mediocrely, South Korea leads

BEIJING, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- The autumn weather in Beijing is pleasant. Today, 44 archers from Asia and Australia gathered in the picturesque Beijing Western Suburbs Shooting Range to compete for the championship in this historic sport.

At 9:30 AM, the sixth Asian Cup archery competition kicked off in a drizzle. Archers from nine countries and regions donned their armor, drew their bows, and began the men's 90-meter and women's 70-meter shooting contests.

The Chinese women's team featured Yao Yawen, Wang Hong, Lu Yinghua, and Ding Yi. Wang Hong finished sixth in this year's World Championships individual event, while Ding Yi won the elimination round at this year's National Youth Games. After the first 18 arrows, the Chinese women trailed behind South Korea and Chinese Taipei. The Chinese Taipei team showed remarkable skill, with their performance nearly matching that of South Korea.

Chinese coach Li Shulan watched the competition and explained to reporters, "Since the departure of veterans like Ma Xiangjun, the Chinese women's team has seen a decline in performance. In the recent World Championships, our women's team only secured sixth place in the team event, while the previously unknown Indonesian team took fourth place. The South Korean team has solid techniques and stable movements. The women's individual champion from the Seoul Olympics, Kim Soo-Nyung, won the World Championships again this year. She did not participate in this Asian Cup. The world silver medalist Kim Kyung-Ah had a poor performance in the first two rounds but caught up in the third round, demonstrating her strong technical skills."

After the 36-arrow 70-meter contest, the South Korean women's team led with 981 points, followed by the Chinese Taipei team with 923 points, and the Chinese team with 901 points.

The Chinese Taipei team has significantly improved its strength over the past six months under the guidance of South Korean coach Kim Hyung-Do, who was hired at a high salary. Kim advised his team not to rush for immediate success but to focus on mastering the basics, aiming for the gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

The men's 90-meter contest was as expected, with the South Korean team leading with 904 points, followed by the Chinese team with 858 points, and the Chinese Taipei team with 847 points.

    亚洲杯射箭赛雨中开场
    中国队新人表现平平　南朝鲜选手战绩居先
    本报北京10月4日讯　记者李北大、江正茂报道：金秋的北京，气候宜人。44名亚洲及澳大利亚箭坛好手今天在风景秀丽的北京西郊射击场内摆开阵势，争逐这一历史悠久的竞技项目桂冠。
    上午9点30分，第六届亚洲杯射箭比赛在蒙蒙细雨中拉开序幕。9个国家和地区的男女选手披甲上阵，弯弓搭箭，首先展开了男子90米和女子70米射程的较量。
    中国女队出场队员是姚雅文、王红、陆莹华、丁毅。王红是今年世界锦标赛个人赛第6名，丁毅是今年全国青运会淘汰赛冠军。前18支箭出手，中国姑娘成绩落在南朝鲜和中国台北队后面。中国台北队身手不凡，战绩与南朝鲜队不相上下。
    中国队教练李淑兰一边观看比赛，一边向记者解释说，自从马湘君等一批老将离队后，中国女队成绩出现滑坡，几个月前的世界锦标赛，我女队仅获团体第6名，而过去默默无闻的印度尼西亚队取得第4名。南朝鲜队员技术扎实，动作稳定。汉城奥运会女子个人冠军金水宁，在世界锦标赛上又获冠军。这次亚洲杯赛，她没有来。世界亚军金京郁前两轮发挥不好，第三轮又追了上来，可见技术过硬。
    70米射程36支箭赛完，南朝鲜女队以981环暂居榜首，中国台北队以923环列第二名，中国队以901环排在第三位。
    中国台北队高薪聘请南朝鲜教练金享铎指导该队，半年来，实力明显增强。金享铎告诫队员不要急于求成，练好基本功，目标是1992年巴塞罗那奥运会金牌。
    男子90米比赛也不出预料，南朝鲜队以904环遥遥领先，中国队858环，中国台北队847环。
