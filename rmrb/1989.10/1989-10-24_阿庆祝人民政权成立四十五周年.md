	Albania celebrated the 45th anniversary of the establishment of the people's government in the city of Berat on October 23. Party and government leaders Aliya and Charcani, along with tens of thousands of people, participated in a gathering to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the Second Anti-Fascist National Liberation Conference (also known as the Berat Conference).

	The Berat Conference, held from October 20 to 23, 1944, marked the birth of the country's first people's government—the Democratic Government of Albania, the precursor to today's Albanian government, with Hoxha as its chairman.

	According to reports in today's Albanian newspapers, Muftiu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the People's Assembly Presidium, delivered a speech at the memorial gathering held in the city center in the morning. He emphasized that maintaining close ties with the masses is a decisive factor in consolidating the government. He called for a struggle against the two dangers of bureaucracy and liberalism that threaten proletarian dictatorship from within. He said that the Party regards the further promotion of socialist democracy and the comprehensive consolidation of the people's government as an important aspect of class struggle, as a fundamental issue in the continuous advancement of the socialist revolution.

　　阿庆祝人民政权成立四十五周年
    新华社地拉那十月二十三日电  阿尔巴尼亚培拉特市二十三日一派节日气氛，阿利雅、查尔查尼等阿党政领导人同数万群众一起参加了为纪念第二次反法西斯民族解放会议（也称培拉特会议）四十五周年而举行的集会。
    在一九四四年十月二十至二十三日举行的培拉特会议上，诞生了这个国家历史上第一个人民政权——阿尔巴尼亚民主政府，即今日阿政府的前身，霍查任政府主席。
    据阿报今天报道，阿党中央政治局委员，人民议会主席团副主席穆夫蒂乌上午在市中心举行的纪念集会上发表讲话。他强调，密切联系群众是巩固政权的决定性因素。要同从内部威胁无产阶级专政的官僚主义和自由主义这两种危险进行斗争。他说，阿党把进一步发扬社会主义民主，全面巩固人民政权看作是阶级斗争最重要的一个方面，看作是不断开展社会主义革命的基本问题。
