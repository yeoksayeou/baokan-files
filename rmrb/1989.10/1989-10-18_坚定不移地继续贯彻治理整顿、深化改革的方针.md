The policy of reform and opening up in China will it change? What is the prospect for China's reform and opening up? These are questions that many people at home and abroad are very concerned about.

I. Reform is an inevitable trend in the self-development and perfection of socialism and is not subject to human will.

After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the state have repeatedly emphasized: China's reform and opening up will not change. The reform measures announced by the Party Central Committee and the State Council will all be implemented. Why is this? We should understand this issue from the combination of theory and practice.

First of all, fundamentally, it is because the basic contradiction in socialist society, that is, the contradiction between the productive relations and productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, requires us to constantly adjust and reform the parts and links in the productive relations that are not adapted to the development of productive forces, and the parts and links in the superstructure that are not adapted to the economic base, in order to promote the development of social productive forces. Reform is the inevitable path for the perfection and development of socialism, and is an inevitable trend in historical development, which cannot be changed.

Secondly, from the legal perspective, reform and opening up is a basic policy stipulated by the Constitution of our country. The Constitution is the fundamental law of our country, with the highest legal effect and stability. By explicitly including reform and opening up in the Constitution, it reflects the highest interests of the Chinese people, not only indicating that our Constitution adapts to the needs of historical development, but also providing a legal basis for further reform and opening up in the future. Therefore, the basic policy of reform and opening up recognized by the Constitution will not change, but will be implemented more steadily, better, and faster.

Thirdly, from the perspective of ten years of reform practice, ten years of reform have achieved universally recognized great achievements. China's reform was carried out under the personal advocacy and guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and the chief designer of the reform is Comrade Deng Xiaoping, not anyone else. Ten years of reform and opening up have injected unprecedented vigor and vitality into the development of China's economy. It is the fastest period of economic development, the strongest period of national economic strength, and the most significant period of improvement in people's living standards since the Opium War. In these ten years, the total social product, national income, and national fiscal revenue have all more than doubled. The production of industry and agriculture has undergone profound changes, and the economic and technological strength has been greatly enhanced. With the development of production, people's living standards have improved significantly in the past ten years. The per capita income of urban residents has more than doubled, the market is prosperous, and the vast majority of people across the country have already achieved a life of basic subsistence, and the living standards of people in poverty-stricken areas have also improved.

Of course, we must be soberly aware that while achieving great successes, there have also been some obvious mistakes. For example, in the process of reform and opening up, there has been a lack of consistency in adhering to the four cardinal principles, an insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of reform, a lack of comprehensive coordination, and a failure to establish a macro-control system in a timely manner during the process of decentralization and activation, leading to the intensification of inflation, as well as the emergence of issues such as unfair social distribution. However, these problems are minor compared to the great achievements of ten years of reform and opening up. We cannot deny the mainstream of ten years of reform and opening up because of these problems. Since the direction of reform and opening up is correct and the overall situation is successful, we have no reason to change the policy of reform and opening up.

Fourthly, from the perspective of the current need for economic stability and deepening reform, we not only need to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, but also need to maintain the stability and continuity of some major reform measures that have been announced. Continuing to implement the reform measures announced by the Party Central Committee and the State Council is conducive to the stability of the economy, people's hearts, and society. For example, the factory director (manager) responsibility system cannot be changed, because it has been included in the "Enterprise Law," and the "Enterprise Law" is a law passed by the National People's Congress, which is the basic law of enterprises. Since the law has been established, it should maintain the seriousness and stability of the law and should not be changed arbitrarily. Of course, this does not mean that once a law is established, it can never be changed. After many years of practice, if there are indeed inappropriate aspects, they should be modified through legal procedures. Modern enterprises must establish a unified, powerful, and efficient production command and management system. Implementing the factory director (manager) responsibility system is an objective requirement of socialized large-scale production. In recent years, there have indeed been problems in enterprises where party building has been neglected and ideological and political work has been weak. We should adopt a realistic attitude and solve whatever problems arise. We should strengthen party building and ideological and political work, and establish a political and ideological work system with the party committee as the core. The party committee should truly play the role of guaranteeing and supervising the implementation of the party's policies and the completion of state tasks. The working class is the master of the enterprise, and we should rely wholeheartedly on the working class. The factory director (manager) and the party secretary should respect and support each other, coordinate and cooperate, and work together. We cannot negate the factory director (manager) responsibility system because we want to strengthen party building and ideological and political work in enterprises; nor can we relax party building and ideological and political work because we want to adhere to the implementation of the factory director (manager) responsibility system.

II. China cannot pursue a market economy based on private ownership; it must adhere to a planned commodity economy based on public ownership.

Our reform and opening up is socialist reform and opening up, and we must adhere to the four cardinal principles because they stipulate our basic economic and political systems, which are the foundation of our country. Without adhering to the four cardinal principles, reform and opening up will deviate from the socialist track. Reform and opening up is our path to national strength. We are not reforming the fundamental system of socialism, but rather reforming the institutional drawbacks that are not adapted to the development of productive forces. Reform is the self-improvement and development of the socialist system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, aimed at fully bringing into play the superiority of socialism. Without adhering to reform and opening up, we cannot enhance the vitality and attractiveness of socialism, cannot fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system, and have no hope of "realizing the four modernizations and revitalizing China."

Those who insist on bourgeois liberalization, under the banner of reform and opening up, advocate "complete Westernization," that is, capitalization. We must organically combine adhering to the four cardinal principles with adhering to reform and opening up, and carry out reform and opening up on the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhere to the four cardinal principles in the process of reform and opening up.

Socialist economy is a planned commodity economy based on public ownership. This is the overall goal of our economic system reform. The fundamental difference between socialist planned commodity economy and capitalist market economy lies in the difference in ownership. We, under the premise of adhering to the dominant position of public ownership, implement the combination of planned economy and market regulation, and promote the development of socialist planned commodity economy. Capitalism, on the other hand, implements a market economy regulated by the market on the basis of private ownership. Public ownership is the economic foundation of socialism, while private ownership is the economic foundation of capitalism. The relationship of ownership determines the social nature of commodity economy. Therefore, to adhere to the socialist direction, we must adhere to the dominant position of public ownership.

The stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization vigorously propagate the implementation of economic privatization and negate socialist public ownership, claiming that "the only fundamental solution is to reform public ownership into private ownership." This is completely wrong.

The policy of our party is, under the premise of adhering to the dominant position of public ownership, to develop various forms of ownership economy, to allow and actively encourage individual economy and private economy to develop within a certain scope, and to play their beneficial and necessary supplementary role in the socialist economy. This is a correct decision made according to the characteristics of our country being in the primary stage of socialism, with a low degree of socialization of production, low level of productive forces, and unbalanced development. However, the advocates of privatization want to fundamentally change the economic foundation of China, making private ownership the mainstay of China's economy, negating socialist public ownership, and further negating the socialist system.

The advocates of privatization assert that socialist public ownership can only bring about "low efficiency and stagnant production," and therefore public ownership is not as good as private ownership, and socialism is not as good as capitalism. This is untenable both in theory and practice.

Due to the drawbacks of the original economic system, the superiority of the socialist system in our country has not been fully brought into play. The history of ten years of reform and opening up proves that as long as we carry out reforms, the superiority of socialism based on public ownership can be fully brought into play, production can be rapidly developed, and efficiency can be improved.

From 1979 to 1988, the average annual growth rate of our national income was 9.6%, which was much faster than the average annual growth rate of 6.1% in the previous 26 years (1953-1978). According to statistics from the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, from 1980 to 1986, the average annual growth rate of national income in the world was 2.3%. Among them, the United States was 2.4%, Japan was 3.7%, the nine countries of the European Economic Community were 1.4%, the "Four Little Dragons" of Asia were 7.2%, and the Soviet Union was 2.4%. Our national income has risen to the 8th position in the world, and the output of some important products has leaped to the forefront of the world. For example, from 1978 to 1988, the output of grain increased from the 2nd position in the world to the 1st position, cotton from the 3rd position to the 1st position, steel from the 5th position to the 4th position, coal from the 3rd position to the 1st position, crude oil from the 8th position to the 5th position, and electricity generation from the 7th position to the 4th position. Now, we have established an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national economic system. Of course, we must be soberly aware that due to the large population and weak foundation, our per capita output is still far behind that of developed countries. But ten years of reform has indeed proven that the potential of the socialist system to promote the development of production is enormous. As long as we do a good job in reform, the superiority of socialism will be further brought into play.

After ten years of reform, our country has emerged a number of advanced enterprises with public ownership. For example, the Beijing Steel and Iron Corporation has increased its steel output by an amount equivalent to a large steel plant after ten years of reform, achieving an average annual increase in profits of 20%, an average annual increase in labor productivity of 13.66%, reaching the advanced level in the world, and contributing an average of 100 million yuan to the state each year, which is nearly 9 times the average annual contribution to the state in the 30 years before the reform. The tremendous changes in the ten years of reform in Beijing Steel and Iron Corporation are the result of adhering to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up, which shows that large and medium-sized enterprises with socialist public ownership can be full of vitality and vigor through reform. Therefore, we must carry out the reform to the end.

III. Correctly handle the relationship between rectification and deepening reform, and the current reform should first promote rectification and stable economic development.

The policy of "rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening the reform" decided by the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee must be continued to be implemented resolutely. The view that rectification is a retreat and reform and opening up will stagnate is groundless. Rectification and deepening reform are dialectically unified, closely related, and mutually promoting, rather than opposing each other. On the one hand, rectification is carried out on the premise of adhering to the general policy of reform and opening up. Rectification is to create a better environment and conditions for reform and opening up, promote the deepening of reform, and the realization of the goals of rectification not only needs to rely on the deepening of reform, but many measures of rectification themselves are also important contents of deepening reform. On the other hand, we cannot reform for the sake of reform. Reform should be based on the requirements of rectification and economic stability. All reform measures and steps at present must be conducive to compressing demand, increasing effective supply, easing the contradiction between social total demand exceeding total supply, curbing inflation, and must be conducive to the optimization of economic structure and the improvement of economic benefits, and must be conducive to the stability of the economy and society. To this end, the following things must be done:

1. With the focus on enhancing the vitality of large and medium-sized key enterprises under full public ownership, continue to deepen enterprise reform. Large and medium-sized industrial enterprises under full public ownership are the backbone and lifeline of our economy. At present, nearly 80% of our fiscal revenue comes from large and medium-sized enterprises, so we should take the enhancement of the vitality of large and medium-sized enterprises as the focus of deepening enterprise reform. According to the industrial policy, we should tilt towards large and medium-sized key enterprises in terms of energy, raw materials, funds, transportation, etc., and give priority to supporting them, so as to better play the leading role of public ownership economy. At present, we should continue to adhere to and improve the effective reform measures such as the factory director (manager) responsibility system and the contract responsibility system. We should summarize experience and constantly improve it; strengthen enterprise internal management, rely on workers to participate in democratic management, fully play the role of the working class as the master, and establish and improve the mechanism of enterprise self-regulation and self-constraint. At the same time, we should combine rectification and encourage horizontal cooperation and mergers between enterprises, and develop enterprise groups in a planned and step-by-step manner to promote the adjustment of industrial structure, product structure, and enterprise organizational structure.

2. Suppress consumption demand and ease unfair social distribution. The rapid growth of consumption demand is an important reason for the contradiction between social total demand exceeding total supply and the intensification of inflation. Due to the rapid growth of consumption funds, it forces price increases, a large increase in price subsidies, a heavy fiscal burden, an increase in production costs, and an intensification of the contradiction between consumption structure and production structure. At the same time as the rapid growth of consumption demand, the phenomenon of unfair social distribution is also becoming more and more serious, which corrupts social customs and causes dissatisfaction among the people. The focus of suppressing the expansion of consumption demand should be on controlling the income of extra-budgetary units, the extra-budgetary income of budgetary units, the income of high-income earners, and the income outside of workers' wages. To this end, first of all, we should clean up and rectify various tax exemption policies. The power of tax exemption must be centralized, and tax exemption must be based on industrial policy, income policy, and regional development policy, rather than based on the different ownership, departments, and regions. Secondly, we should clean up various incomes, such as the income of schools, hospitals, and scientific research institutions, the income of enterprises and institutions under contract and lease, and the wage income of various companies. Thirdly, we should strengthen the tax collection and administration of individual business owners, private enterprise owners, and various high-income earners, and strengthen the tax collection and administration of bonus tax and wage adjustment tax. Fourthly, we should continue to firmly compress and control collective consumption, and further overcome various wasteful phenomena. Fifthly, we should correctly guide consumption, stabilize and increase savings deposits, and absorb and transfer, and postpone the realization of surplus purchasing power.

3. Strengthen and improve macro-control and establish a macro-control system. This is a requirement for the development of socialist planned commodity economy, and it is itself an important content of reform, and is also an important condition for ensuring the stable development of the national economy. The focus of strengthening and improving macro-control and establishing a macro-economic control system should be on the transformation of the macro-control mechanism. The original economic growth mechanism makes various levels of government, in order to ensure the growth of fiscal revenue, must maintain a relatively fast economic growth rate, and thus must continuously expand the scale of government investment, causing investment expansion. In order to gradually reduce the investment scope of various levels of government and curb investment expansion, it is necessary to adjust the powers and financial powers of various levels of government in a planned way, and to establish a macro-economic balance system, straighten out the relationship between planning, finance, banks, and strive to achieve the four major balances of finance, credit, materials, and foreign exchange, change the situation of national income over-allocation, fundamentally ease the contradiction between social total demand exceeding total supply, and curb inflation. At the same time, it is necessary to appropriately increase the proportion of national fiscal revenue in national income distribution and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national fiscal revenue, so as to strengthen the central government's macro-control capacity.

4. Continue to do a good job in pilot projects and seriously summarize experience. For example, we should summarize the experience of the tax and profit sharing pilot project in Chongqing and other places, and continue to expand the pilot projects of tax and profit sharing, tax after loan repayment, and tax after contract. For example, in the pilot project of enterprise shareholding system, we should adhere to the dominant position of public ownership and cannot take private ownership as the mainstay. How to carry out the shareholding system on the basis of public ownership, we have no experience and no ready-made model to learn from, so we must carry out pilot projects in a planned and step-by-step manner, summarize the experience of the enterprises that have been piloted, and it is not advisable to add new pilot enterprises. In order to create conditions for the next step of deepening reform, we must also do a good job in various basic work. For example, establish accounting and auditing firms, strictly establish accounts, and improve the invoice system, etc., to create conditions for plugging tax loopholes and increasing fiscal revenue from the system.

5. Adhere to the policy of opening up to the outside world and further strengthen international economic and technological cooperation and exchanges. Implementing the policy of opening up to the outside world is an inevitable trend of social development, a strategic measure to accelerate socialist modernization, and a basic policy that our country must adhere to for a long time. In the ten years of implementing the policy of opening up to the outside world, it has injected new vitality into our national economy and has been supported by the people. We will not go back to the old path of "closure." After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the state have repeatedly emphasized: China's policy of opening up to the outside world will continue to be adhered to, and we will continue to maintain and develop friendly relations and economic and technological cooperation with various countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The policy of the Chinese government has begun to be understood by more and more countries and business people, who have expressed their willingness to continue to maintain and develop friendly relations and economic and technological cooperation with China. We should do a solid job, promote the healthy development of opening up to the outside world. We should strive to improve the investment environment, actively introduce advanced foreign science and technology, absorb foreign investment and appropriately use foreign funds, learn from foreign management experience reflecting socialized large-scale production, and accelerate the construction of our country.

    坚定不移地继续贯彻治理整顿、深化改革的方针
    高尚全
    中国的改革开放方针政策会不会改变？中国改革开放的前景如何？这是国内外许多人都十分关心的一个大问题。
      一、改革是社会主义自我发展和完善的必然趋势，是不以人的意志为转移的
    在平息反革命暴乱之后，中国党和国家领导人一再重申：中国的改革开放绝不会改变，党中央和国务院已经宣布出台的改革措施都要贯彻执行。这是为什么呢？我们应从理论和实践的结合上来理解这个问题。
    第一，从根本上来说，是因为社会主义社会的基本矛盾，即生产关系和生产力、上层建筑和经济基础的矛盾的存在和发展，使我们需要不断调整和改革生产关系中不适应生产力发展的部分和环节、上层建筑中不适应经济基础的部分和环节，才能促进社会生产力的发展。改革是社会主义完善和发展的必由之路，是历史发展的必然，是不能改变的。
    第二，从法律的角度来说，改革开放是我国宪法所确定的基本国策。宪法是我国的根本大法，具有最高的法律效力和稳定性。把改革开放明确地写进宪法，体现了中国人民的最高利益，不仅表明我国宪法适应了历史发展的需要，而且也为今后进一步改革开放提供了法律依据。因此，宪法所确认的改革开放这一基本国策不仅不会改变，而且还要搞得更稳、更好、更快。
    第三，从十年改革的实践来说，十年改革取得了举世公认的巨大成就。中国的改革是在邓小平同志亲自倡导和指导下进行的，改革的总设计师是邓小平同志而不是别的人。改革开放10年，给我国经济发展注入了前所未有的强大的生机与活力，是从鸦片战争以来，中国历史上经济发展最快、国家经济实力最强和人民生活改善最显著的10年。这10年，社会总产值、国民生产总值、国民收入和国家财政收入都翻了一番多，工农业生产面貌发生了深刻的变化，经济技术力量大大增强。随着生产的发展，10年来人民生活有了较大的改善，城镇居民人均收入增加了一倍多，市场繁荣，全国绝大多数人已过上温饱生活，贫困地区人民生活也有了改善。
    当然，我们必须清醒地看到，在取得巨大成绩的同时，也有一些明显的失误。例如，在改革开放中坚持四项基本原则缺乏一贯性，对改革的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足，注意综合配套不够，在放权搞活过程中，未及时抓紧建立宏观调控体系，通货膨胀加剧，以及出现社会分配不公等问题。但是，这些问题同10年改革开放所取得的巨大成绩相比，毕竟是支流，我们不能因为出现这些问题而否定十年改革开放的主流。既然改革开放的方向是正确的，总体上是成功的，我们就没有理由去改变改革开放的方针政策。
    第四，从当前稳定经济和深化改革的需要来说，我们不仅要坚持改革开放的方针政策不变，而且已经出台的一些重大改革措施也要保持稳定性和连续性。继续贯彻执行党中央、国务院已经宣布出台的改革措施，有利于经济的稳定、人心的稳定和社会的稳定。例如，厂长（经理）负责制不能变，因为它已经上了《企业法》，《企业法》是经全国人大通过的，是企业的基本法。既然立了法，就应当保持法律的严肃性和稳定性，不能随意变动。当然，这并不是说立了法就永远不能变了。经过多年实践，如确有不适当的，需要修改，也应该通过法律程序解决。现代化企业必须建立统一的、强有力的、高效率的生产指挥和经营管理系统，实行厂长（经理）负责制是社会化大生产的客观要求。这几年，企业中也确实存在着忽视党的建设，思想政治工作薄弱的问题，我们应当抱着实事求是的态度，有什么问题就解决什么问题。要切实地加强党的建设，加强思想政治工作，要建立以党委为核心的政治思想工作体系。党委要真正发挥贯彻执行党的方针政策和完成国家任务的保证、监督作用。工人阶级是企业的主人，要全心全意依靠工人阶级。企业的厂长（经理）与党委书记之间要互相尊重，互相支持，协调配合，搞好团结。我们不能因为要加强企业党的建设和思想政治工作而否定厂长（经理）负责制；也不能因为要坚持贯彻执行厂长（经理）负责制而放松党的建设和思想政治工作。
    二、中国不能搞私有制为主体的市场经济，必须坚持在公有制基础上的有计划的商品经济
    我们的改革开放是社会主义的改革开放，必须坚持四项基本原则，因为它规定了我国基本的经济制度和政治制度，是我们的立国之本。不坚持四项基本原则，就会使改革开放脱离社会主义轨道。改革开放是我们的强国之路。我们要改革的不是社会主义的根本制度，而是改革不适应生产力发展的体制弊端。改革是在中国共产党领导下社会主义制度的自我完善和发展，是为了充分发挥社会主义的优越性。不坚持改革开放就不能增强社会主义的活力和吸引力，就不能充分显示社会主义制度的优越性，就没有希望“实现四化、振兴中华”。
    那些坚持资产阶级自由化的人，打着改革开放的旗号，鼓吹“全盘西化”，也就是资本主义化。我们必须把坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放有机地统一起来，在坚持四项基本原则的前提下搞好改革开放，在进行改革开放中坚持四项基本原则。
    社会主义经济是公有制基础上的有计划的商品经济。这是我们经济体制改革的总目标。社会主义有计划的商品经济同资本主义市场经济，其本质的区别在于所有制不同。我们是在坚持以公有制为主体的前提下，实行计划经济和市场调节相结合，促进社会主义有计划商品经济的发展。资本主义则在私有制的基础上，实行由市场调节的市场经济。公有制是社会主义的经济基础，私有制是资本主义的经济基础。所有制的关系决定着商品经济的社会性质。因此，坚持社会主义方向，必须坚持公有制占主体地位。
    顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人竭力宣扬实行经济私有化，否定社会主义公有制。说什么“唯有改革公有制为私有制方是根本办法”。这是完全错误的。
    我们党的政策是，在坚持公有制为主体的前提下，发展多种所有制经济，允许和积极鼓励个体经济、私营经济在一定范围内的发展，发挥其对社会主义经济的有益的、必要的补充作用。这是根据我国正处在社会主义初级阶段，生产社会化程度较低、生产力水平不高，发展不平衡等特点作出的正确决策。而私有化的鼓吹者则要从根本上改变中国的经济基础，使私有制成为我国经济的主体，否定社会主义公有制，进而否定社会主义制度。
    私有化的鼓吹者断言社会主义公有制只能带来“低效率，生产停滞”，因此公有制不如私有制，社会主义不如资本主义。这在理论和实践上都是站不住脚的。
    我国由于原有经济体制上的弊病，使社会主义制度的优越性未能充分地发挥出来。十年改革开放的历史证明，只要通过改革，以公有制为基础的社会主义的优越性是能够充分发挥出来的，生产是可以迅速发展的，效率是可以提高的。
    从1979年到1988年，我国国民生产总值平均每年增长9.6％，大大快于前26年（1953—1978年）平均每年增长6.1％的速度。据日本经济企划厅统计，从1980年到1986年，全世界范围的国民生产总值平均每年增长2.3％。其中美国为2.4％，日本为3.7％，欧洲共同体9国为1.4％，亚洲“四小龙”为7.2％，苏联为2.4％。我国的国民生产总值已上升到占世界的第8位，一些重要产品产量已跃居世界前列。例如，从1978年到1988年，谷物产量从世界第2位上升到第1位，棉花从第3位上升到第1位，钢从第5位上升到第4位，煤从第3位上升到第1位，原油从第8位上升到第5位，发电量从第7位上升到第4位。现在我国已经建立了独立的、门类比较齐全的工业体系和国民经济体系。当然，我们必须清醒地看到，我国由于人口多，底子薄，人均产量与发达国家相比还有很大差距。但十年改革毕竟证明了社会主义制度推动生产发展的潜力是十分巨大的，只要搞好改革，社会主义的优越性必将进一步地发挥出来。
    经过十年改革，我国已涌现出一批公有制的先进企业。例如，首都钢铁公司改革十年，增加的钢材产量相当于一座大型钢铁厂的产量，实现利润平均每年递增20％，劳动生产率平均每年增长13.66％，达到了国际上的先进水平，平均每年为国家贡献10亿元，相当于改革前30年平均每年为国家贡献的近9倍。首钢十年改革的巨大变化，是坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放的结果，说明了社会主义公有制的大中型企业，通过改革是能够充满生机和活力的。所以，我们要把改革进行到底。
    三、正确处理治理整顿与深化改革的关系，当前改革首先要促进治理整顿和经济的稳定发展
    党的十三届三中全会确定的“治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革”的方针，必须继续坚决贯彻执行。那种认为治理整顿是倒退、改革开放会停滞的看法是毫无根据的。治理整顿与深化改革是辩证的统一，两者是紧密联系、互相促进的，而不是互相对立的。一方面，治理整顿是在坚持改革开放总方针的前提下进行的，治理整顿是为改革开放创造更好的环境和条件，推动改革的深化，治理整顿目标的实现不仅需要依靠改革的深化，而且许多治理整顿的措施本身就是深化改革的重要内容；另一方面，我们不能为改革而改革，改革要根据治理整顿和稳定经济的要求，当前的一切改革措施和步骤，都必须有利于压缩需求，增加有效供给，缓解社会总需求超过总供给的矛盾，抑制通货膨胀，都必须有利于经济结构的优化和经济效益的提高，都必须有利于经济和社会的稳定。为此，必须做好以下几件事：
    1、以增强全民所有制大中型骨干企业活力为重点，继续深化企业改革。全民所有制大中型骨干工业企业是我国经济的支柱和命脉，目前我国有近80％的财政收入来自大中型企业，因此要把继续增强大中型企业的活力作为深化企业改革的重点。根据产业政策，在能源、原材料、资金、运输等方面向大中型骨干企业倾斜，择优扶持，促使公有制经济更好地发挥主导作用。当前要继续坚持和完善发展企业厂长（经理）负责制、承包经营责任制等行之有效的改革措施。要总结经验，不断完善；加强企业内部管理，依靠工人参加民主管理，充分发挥工人阶级的主人翁作用，建立健全企业自我调节和自我约束的机制。同时，要结合治理整顿，鼓励企业之间的横向联合与兼并，有计划有步骤地发展企业集团，促进产业结构、产品结构和企业组织结构的调整。
    2、抑制消费需求，缓解社会分配不公。消费需求增长过快，是社会总需求大于总供给、通货膨胀加剧的一个重要原因。由于消费基金增长过快，迫使物价上涨，价格补贴大量增加，财政负担加重，增加了生产成本，加剧了消费结构与生产结构的矛盾。而在消费需求增长过快的同时，社会分配不公现象也
  日趋严重，它败坏了社会风气，引起群众的不满。抑制消费需求膨胀，重点应放在控制预算外单位收入、预算内单位的预算外收入、高收入者的收入和职工工资以外的收入上。为此，首先要清理整顿各种减免税政策。减免税的权力必须集中，减免税必须根据产业政策、收入政策和地区发展政策，而不应根据所有制、部门和地方的不同而制订。其次，清理各种收入，如学校、医院、科研单位的创收，企事业单位承包、租赁的收入，各类公司的工资收入等。第三，加强对个体户、私营企业主以及各种高收入的税收征管工作，加强奖金税、工资调节税的征管。第四，继续坚决压缩和控制社会集团性消费，进一步克服各种铺张浪费现象。第五，正确引导消费，稳定和增加储蓄存款，吸收和转移、推迟实现结余购买力。
    3、加强和改善宏观调控，建立宏观调控体系。这是发展社会主义有计划商品经济的要求，其本身就是改革的一项重要内容，也是保证国民经济稳定发展的重要条件。加强和改善宏观调控，建立宏观经济调控体系，重点应放在宏观调控机制的转换上。原有的经济增长机制，促使各级政府为了保证财政收入的增长，就必须保持较快的经济增长速度，从而必须不断扩大政府投资规模，造成投资膨胀。为了逐步缩小各级政府的投资范围，抑制投资膨胀，必须有计划地调整各级政府的事权和财权，还要建立宏观经济平衡制度，理顺计划、财政、银行之间的关系，努力实现财政、信贷、物资和外汇四大平衡，改变国民收入超分配状况，从根本上缓解社会总需求超过总供给的矛盾，克服通货膨胀。同时，要适当提高国家财政收入在国民收入分配中的比重，提高中央财政收入在国家财政收入中的比重，以加强中央的宏观调控能力。
    4、继续搞好试点，认真总结经验。例如，要总结重庆等地税利分流试点的经验，继续扩大税利分流、税后还贷、税后承包的试点。再如在企业股份制的试点中，要坚持公有制为主体，而不能以私有制为主体。在公有制基础上如何搞股份制，我们还没有经验，也没有现成的模式可以借鉴，因此必须有计划、有步骤地进行试点，总结已经试点企业的经验，不宜再增加新的试点企业。为了给下一步深化改革创造条件，还必须做好各项基础工作。例如建立会计审计事务所，严格建账，健全发货票制度等等，从制度上为堵塞税收撒漏、增加财政收入创造条件。
    5、坚持对外开放，进一步加强国际经济技术的合作与交流。实行对外开放是社会发展的必然趋势，是加快社会主义现代化建设的战略措施，是我国必须长期坚持的一项基本国策。实施对外开放十年来，给我国国民经济增添了新的活力，得到了人民的拥护，我们决不会回到“关闭”的老路上去。在平息反革命暴乱以后，我国党和国家领导人多次重申：我国的对外开放政策将继续坚持不变，在平等互利的基础上继续同世界各国交往。我国政府的这个政策，已经开始为越来越多的国家政府和企业界人士所理解，纷纷表示要继续与我国保持和发展友好往来和经济技术合作关系。我们要扎扎实实地做好工作，促进对外开放的健康发展。我们要努力改善投资环境，积极引进国外先进科学技术，吸收外商投资和适当利用国外资金，借鉴国外反映社会化大生产的管理经验，加快我国的建设。
