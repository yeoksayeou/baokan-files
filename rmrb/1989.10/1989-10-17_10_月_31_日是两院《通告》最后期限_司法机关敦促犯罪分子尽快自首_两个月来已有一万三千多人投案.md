The deadline for the announcement by the two courts is October 31, and judicial authorities are urging criminals to surrender quickly. Over 13,000 people have surrendered in the past two months.

BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Lin Jun today announced that the deadline for the announcement by the two courts is October 31 and will not be extended.

According to Lin Jun, who spoke at a news conference jointly held by the public security, procuratorial, judicial, and court authorities today, courts in various places have held sentencing meetings to implement the lenient and severe policy. According to statistics from 23 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, by October 10, courts at various levels had held 286 sentencing meetings, sentenced 523 cases, and dealt with 632 criminals. Among them, 285 were sentenced leniently, and 142 were sentenced severely.

Lin Jun warned criminals that the deadline for the announcement by the two courts is approaching, and they should abandon their illusions and take the path of confession and leniency as soon as possible. If they do not wake up in time and miss the opportunity, they will face severe punishment by law.

Lin Jun also stated that after the deadline for the announcement by the two courts, for cases of surrender, as long as they meet the relevant provisions of the criminal law, they will still be dealt with leniently or mitigated according to law, and some will be exempted from criminal punishment according to law. However, the scope for leniency will not be as broad as that stipulated in the announcement by the two courts.

Lin Jun reported at the meeting that a serious incident occurred in Tianjin, where a accomplice was obstructed from surrendering and then killed to cover up the crime. He pointed out that with the deepening of the implementation of the announcement, some places have recently discovered some criminals who harbor and conceal economic criminals or hide, destroy crime evidence, and transfer illicit money and goods for criminals. There have also been frequent incidents of retaliation against informants. He demanded that courts in various places, when handling the above-mentioned criminal cases, must strictly punish them and not be lenient. Otherwise, it will be impossible to protect the enthusiasm of the broad masses to fight against economic criminals and to ensure the smooth progress of this struggle.

In addition, it is reported that since the announcement was issued on August 15, a total of 13,640 criminals have surrendered to the procuratorial organs across the country. This was revealed by Vice Prosecutor-General Zhang Siquan today to the capital's press corps.

Statistics from the Supreme People's Procuratorate show that among the economic criminals who surrendered, 3,303 had crimes amounting to more than 100,000 yuan, including 252 with crimes amounting to more than 1 million yuan; 317 were county-level and above cadres; the surrenderers together returned a total of 85.57 million yuan in illicit money and goods.

In addition, 1,919 prisoners in custody, under the influence of the announcement, truthfully confessed their past unconfessed crimes and exposed other criminals.

Zhang Siquan also introduced two typical cases today.

He Jiaoping, the person in charge of a construction team in Guangdong Province, accepted hints from the bribe-taker and bribed a total of 90,000 yuan in four instances. After the announcement was issued, He Jiaoping surrendered and had his son return from abroad to testify, and at the same time, he retrieved all the illicit money from the bribe-taker and turned it in. Considering these circumstances, after research by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, it was agreed to exempt He Jiaoping from prosecution, and the bribe-taker will be dealt with in another case.

In October 1987, Gan Su Provincial Bureau of Industry and Commerce Director Duan Kaisheng assigned two deputy bureau-level cadres to extort 119,000 yuan from a unit that was transferring land for construction. Later, these two cadres bribed Duan Kaisheng with more than 20,000 yuan in cash and household appliances. After the announcement was issued, these two cadres confessed and surrendered, but Duan Kaisheng still refused to confess. After the procuratorial organs seized all the illicit goods, Duan Kaisheng was arrested according to law.

Zhang Siquan said that the Party and the state's policy of punishing corruption is unwavering, and the procuratorial organs have always adhered to a serious and law-abiding attitude in handling cases of corruption, bribery, and other crimes.

    10月31日是两院《通告》最后期限
    司法机关敦促犯罪分子尽快自首
    两个月来已有一万三千多人投案
    本报北京10月16日讯　记者毛磊报道：最高人民法院副院长林准今天宣布，两院《通告》规定的期限到10月31日为止，不再延长。
    据林准今天在公安、检察、法院、司法联合召开的新闻发布会上介绍，各地法院分别召开了兑现宽严政策的宣判大会。据广东、上海、山东、山西等23个省、自治区、直辖市统计，到10月10日，各级法院召开了宣判大会286次，宣判案件523件，处理案犯632人，其中从宽判处的285人，从严判处的142人。
    林准警告犯罪分子说，现在离《通告》规定的期限很近了，应丢掉幻想，尽快走坦白从宽的道路；如不及早醒悟，错过时机，必将受到法律的严厉制裁。
    林准同时又表示，《通告》规定的限期届满后，对于投案自首的案件，只要符合刑法有关规定的，仍要依法从轻、减轻处罚，有的还要依法免予刑事处分。但是，以后掌握从宽处理的幅度就不会再像两院《通告》规定的那么大了。
    林准在会上通报了发生在天津的一起阻拦同伙自首、进而杀人灭口的严重事件后指出，随着《通告》的深入贯彻，最近一些地方陆续发现一些包庇、窝藏经济罪犯，或者替罪犯隐匿、销毁罪证，转移赃款、赃物的犯罪分子；打击报复举报人的事也屡有发生。他要求各地法院在办理上述犯罪案件时，一定要抓紧从严惩处，决不宽贷。否则，就无法保护广大群众同经济犯罪分子作斗争的积极性，也无法保证这场斗争得以顺利进行。
    又讯：自8月15日《通告》发布以来，全国先后共有1.364万名犯罪分子到检察机关投案自首。这是最高人民检察院副检察长张思卿今天向首都新闻界透露的。
    最高人民检察院的统计表明，投案自首的经济犯罪分子中，犯罪数额在万元以上的有3303人，其中10万元以上的有252人；县处级以上干部317人；自首人员共退出赃款和赃物折款人民币8557万元。
    此外，还有1919名在押人犯在《通告》的感召下，坦白交代了过去未交代的罪行，并检举揭发了其他犯罪分子。
    张思卿今天还介绍了两起典型案件。
    广东省某建筑施工队负责人何家鹏，在承建工程中经受贿人暗示，先后4次行贿人民币9万余元。《通告》发布后，何家鹏投案自首，并让其子从境外回大陆作证，同时向受贿人索回全部赃款交公。考虑到这些情节，经最高人民检察院研究，同意对何家鹏免予起诉，受贿人将另案处理。
    甘肃省工商局长段开盛，1987年10月指派两名副处级干部向被转让建筑用地单位索贿11.9万余元。随后，这两名干部向段开盛行贿两万余元现金和家用电器。《通告》发布后，这两位干部坦白自首，段开盛仍拒不交代。检察机关在查获全部赃物后，已依法将段开盛逮捕。
    张思卿表示，党和国家惩治腐败的方针是坚定不移的，检察机关处理贪污、受贿等犯罪案件，一贯坚持严肃认真、依法办事的态度。
