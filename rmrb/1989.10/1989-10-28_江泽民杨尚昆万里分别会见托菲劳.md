Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Wan Li Meet with Tofilau

Jiang Zemin: China Must Follow the Socialist Path as Determined by Its National Conditions

Yang Shangkun: The Attempts by the Taiwan Authorities to Sabotage National Unity Will Never Succeed

Wan Li: The NPC Must Continuously Strengthen Legal Construction to Safeguard Socialist Democracy

Tofilau: Sino-Western Relations Are Very Good, Hoping to Further Enhance Friendship and Cooperation

BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) — Reporter Gu Yumeng reports: This afternoon, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin met with the Prime Minister of Western Samoa, Tofilau Eti Alesana, at Zhongnanhai. Jiang said, China is a country with a population of 1.1 billion, but we have always advocated that large and small countries, strong and weak countries, rich and poor countries should all be treated equally and respect each other, cooperate and live in harmony on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This foreign policy has been consistent since the founding of our country to this day.

In discussing the domestic situation, Jiang said, China's decades of revolutionary and construction practices have proven that China must adhere to socialism, which is determined by China's national conditions. For a country like China with a large population and relatively low level of social productivity, if it does not adhere to the socialist path but follows the capitalist path as some people advocate, it will only cause the majority of people to fall back into extreme poverty. This does not align with the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. Therefore, our conclusion is: Only socialism can save China and develop China. China must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

Tofilau said, China's strong economy can bring greater help to developing countries around the world, because China best understands the situation of developing countries.

BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) — Reporter Gu Yumeng reports: This morning, State President Yang Shangkun met with the Prime Minister of Western Samoa, Tofilau Eti Alesana, at the Great Hall of the People. Yang said, China is currently focusing on economic construction while also working on the task of national reunification.

Yang said, apart from resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, China still has the Taiwan issue to resolve. Our policy towards Taiwan is to strive for peaceful negotiations to complete the great cause of national reunification. China must be reunified; this is the will of the people and the trend of the times, which no force can stop. Any attempt by the Taiwan authorities to sabotage the great cause of national reunification goes against the fundamental interests and wishes of all Chinese people and will not succeed.

Yang continued, currently, the Taiwan authorities are pursuing so-called "flexible diplomacy" and advocating "dual recognition," which will set obstacles for the cause of national reunification. We firmly oppose this. I hope that countries that have established diplomatic relations with us will be vigilant and pay attention to the activities of the Taiwan authorities that do not conform to the unification of the two sides of the strait.

Tofilau said, Western Samoa has always believed that countries should respect each other and not interfere in each other's internal affairs. Western Samoa has always opposed any activities that disrupt the unity of a country. He believes that China will eventually complete the great cause of national reunification.

Yang expressed his appreciation for the Western Samoa government's adherence to the principles of the two countries' establishment of diplomatic relations and its stance on the One China policy.

Tofilau also conveyed the greetings of the Head of State of Western Samoa, Malietoa Tanumafili II, to Yang. Yang also conveyed his greetings to the Head of State through Tofilau.

BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) — Reporter Gu Yumeng reports: This morning, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Wan Li, met with the Prime Minister of Western Samoa, Tofilau Eti Alesana, and his delegation at the Great Hall of the People.

Wan said, we met in 1987 when you visited China, and it is a pleasure to see you again as old friends.

Wan then informed the guest that we are currently holding the 10th session of the Standing Committee of the 7th National People's Congress, where we will discuss and pass several important laws. The responsibility of the National People's Congress is to continuously strengthen and promote legal construction, using the law to safeguard socialist democracy.

In discussing bilateral relations, Wan said, there are no disagreements between our two countries. I hope that our two countries can serve as a model for cooperation between large and small countries and make our own efforts to promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order. He hopes that the South Pacific region can maintain peace and stability, with countries strengthening unity to promote economic cooperation and development in the region.

Tofilau said, the relationship between Western Samoa and China is very friendly, and we hope to continue to enhance friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

　　江泽民杨尚昆万里分别会见托菲劳
　　江泽民说中国必须走社会主义道路是由国情决定的
    杨尚昆说台湾当局破坏祖国统一的企图决不会得逞
    万里说人大要不断加强法制建设保障社会主义民主
    托菲劳说西中关系非常好希望不断增进友谊和合作
    本报北京10月27日讯　记者顾玉清报道：中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在中南海会见西萨摩亚总理托菲劳·埃蒂·阿莱萨纳时说，中国是一个拥有11亿人口的大国，但我们一贯主张大国小国、强国弱国、富国贫国都应一律平等、互相尊重，在和平共处五项原则基础上友好合作，和睦相处。这一对外原则从我建国伊始一直到现在是始终一贯的。
    江总书记在谈到国内情况时说，中国几十年的革命和建设的实践证明，中国必须坚持搞社会主义，这是由中国的国情所决定的。像中国这样一个大国，人口众多，社会生产力水平比较低，如果不坚持走社会主义道路，而是像有些人主张的那样，走资本主义道路，只能使大多数人重新陷入极其贫困的状态。这是不符合中国人民的根本利益的。因此，我们的结论是：只有社会主义才能救中国，才能发展中国。中国必须坚持中国共产党的领导。
    托菲劳说，中国经济的强大能给世界上的发展中国家带来更大的帮助，因为中国最能理解我们发展中国家的处境。
    本报北京10月27日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天上午，国家主席杨尚昆在人民大会堂会见了西萨摩亚总理托菲劳·埃蒂·阿莱萨纳时说，中国现在以经济建设为中心，同时还有一个统一祖国的任务。
    杨尚昆说，中国除了将对香港和澳门恢复行使主权外，目前还有个台湾问题没有解决。我们对台湾的方针是，力争通过和平谈判完成祖国统一大业。中国要统一，这是人心所向，大势所趋，是任何势力都阻挡不了的。台湾当局任何破坏祖国统一大业的企图，都是违背全体中国人民的根本利益和愿望的，是决不会得逞的。
    杨主席接着指出，目前，台湾当局推行所谓“弹性外交”，搞所谓“双重承认”，这将为祖国统一事业设置障碍，我们坚决反对。我希望已同我国建交的国家对台湾当局所进行的不符合海峡两岸统一的活动保持警惕和注意。
    托菲劳说，西萨摩亚从来认为，国与国之间应该相互尊重、互不干涉内政。西萨摩亚从来反对破坏一个国家统一的任何活动。他认为，中国终将完成祖国统一大业。
    杨主席对西萨摩亚政府遵守两国建交的原则、坚持一个中国的立场表示赞赏。
    托菲劳还向杨主席转达了西萨摩亚国家元首马列托亚·塔努马菲利第二殿下对他的问候。杨主席也通过托菲劳转达他对元首殿下的同样问候。
    本报北京10月27日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天上午，全国人大常委会委员长万里在人民大会堂会见了西萨摩亚总理托菲劳·埃蒂·阿莱萨纳一行。
    万里委员长说，1987年阁下访华时我们见过面，这次作为老朋友再次相会，非常高兴。
    万里接着告诉客人，我们正在举行七届全国人大常委十次会议，将讨论通过一些重要的法令。全国人大的责任就是要不断加强和推动法制建设，以法制来保障社会主义的民主。
    在谈到两国关系时，万里说，我们两国之间不存在任何分歧，我希望我们两国能够成为大小国家合作的典范，并能为推动建立国际政治经济新秩序作出自己的努力。他希望南太平洋地区能够保持和平、稳定，各国加强团结，促进本地区的经济合作和发展。
    托菲劳总理说，西萨摩亚和中国的关系是非常友好的，我们希望继续增进两国间的友谊和合作。（附图片）
