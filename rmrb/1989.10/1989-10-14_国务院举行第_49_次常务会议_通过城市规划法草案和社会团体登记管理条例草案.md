Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 13th.

The State Council held its 49th executive meeting this morning. The meeting discussed and approved the draft of the "People's Republic of China Urban Planning Law" and the draft of the "Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social Organizations." Premier Li Peng presided over the meeting.

The meeting noted that urban planning is essential for determining the nature, scale, and development direction of a city, for the rational use of urban land, for coordinating the spatial layout and various construction projects of a city, and for the comprehensive deployment of a city. It is an important part of the state's management of urban construction, a prerequisite and foundation for ensuring the rational use and development of urban land, and a necessary condition for achieving urban economic and social development goals.

The meeting pointed out that since the founding of the nation, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, China's urban planning work has developed rapidly. The "Urban Planning Regulations" issued by the State Council in 1984 have played an active role in promoting the scientific and rational development of urban planning in China and in ensuring the correct and smooth implementation of urban planning. However, in recent years, with the deepening of urban reforms, the structure and functions of cities have become increasingly diverse, posing many new challenges for urban planning and management work. It is necessary to make corresponding amendments and supplements to the "Urban Planning Regulations." Urban planning involves a wide range of areas in urban political, economic, cultural construction, and urban development, and has strong comprehensiveness. It is necessary to legislate to enhance the authority of urban planning. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to formulate the "Urban Planning Law." The meeting decided to submit the "Urban Planning Law (Draft)" approved today to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation.

The meeting, when deliberating the "Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social Organizations (Draft)," pointed out that the purpose of formulating these regulations is to safeguard citizens' freedom of association, to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of social organizations, to strengthen the management of social organizations, and to give full play to the positive role of social organizations in socialist construction.

These regulations will be promulgated and enforced by the State Council.

Nine people attended today's meeting, and five were absent.

    国务院举行第49次常务会议
    通过城市规划法草案和社会团体登记管理条例草案
    新华社北京10月13日电　国务院今天上午举行第49次常务会议。会议讨论并通过了《中华人民共和国城市规划法（草案）》和《中华人民共和国社会团体登记管理条例（草案）》。李鹏总理主持会议。
    会议认为，城市规划，是为了确立城市性质、规模和发展方向，合理利用城市土地、协调城市空间布局和各项建设所作的综合部署。它是国家管理城市建设的重要内容，是保证城市土地合理利用和开发经营活动协调进行的前提和基础，是实现城市经济和社会发展目标的必要条件。
    会议指出，建国以来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，我国城市规划工作有了较快发展。1984年国务院发布的《城市规划条例》，对促进我国城市规划的科学合理，保障城市规划的正确、顺利实施起到了积极作用。但是，近几年随着城市改革的深入发展，城市的结构和功能日趋多样化，对城市规划和管理工作提出了许多新课题，需要对《城市规划条例》进行相应的修改和补充。城市规划涉及城市政治、经济、文化建设和城市发展的广泛领域，具有很强的综合性，需要通过立法来提高城市规划的权威性。因此，制定《城市规划法》非常迫切，十分必要。会议决定将今天通过的《城市规划法（草案）》，提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议。
    会议在审议《社会团体登记管理条例（草案）》时指出，制订这一条例的目的是为保障公民的结社自由，保障社会团体的合法权益，加强对社会团体的管理，发挥社会团体在社会主义建设中的积极作用。
    这一条例将由国务院公布施行。
    出席今天会议的共9人，请假的5人。
