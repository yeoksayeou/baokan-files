Comrades and Friends,

Today, we gather here to solemnly commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Comrade Li Dazhao.

Li Dazhao was a pioneer of the Chinese communist movement, a great Marxist, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, and one of the principal founders of the Chinese Communist Party.

Seventy years ago, he began his active involvement in China's political arena. At that time, on the one hand, the oppression of imperialism and feudalism brought deep suffering to the people of all nationalities in China. The struggles of patriotic and progressive individuals to save the nation, including the reform movement led by the bourgeoisie during the Hundred Days' Reform and the revolution led by the bourgeoisie during the Xinhai Revolution, had both failed. The capitalist path of nation-building had proven to be a failure in practice. On the other hand, with the initial development of capitalism, China began to see a growing revolutionary force composed of the working class, student groups, and the national bourgeoisie. A new people's revolution was brewing. The success of the October Revolution in Russia brought Marxism-Leninism to China. Li Dazhao, in response to the needs of the times, was the first to raise the banner of Marxism-Leninism on Chinese soil, showing China a new direction for socialist development. As an outstanding early leader of the Chinese Communist Party, he fought bravely on many fronts of the Chinese revolution and made significant contributions. In the history of the Chinese communist movement and the national liberation and social emancipation of the Chinese people, he occupies a lofty historical position.

Li Dazhao was a great patriot. Like many progressive individuals in China at that time, he once sought the truth to save the nation from Western capitalist countries, hoping to cure the deep-seated ills of Chinese society by developing capitalist economic relations and implementing capitalist parliamentary politics. However, he found in practice that the rational kingdom advocated by Western bourgeois enlightenment scholars could not guarantee the realization of justice, equality, and human rights. Especially, the outbreak of World War I further exposed the inherent, insurmountable contradictions within the capitalist system. All of this led him to firmly believe that the capitalist path of nation-building was not feasible in China. He believed that the October Revolution in Russia opened a new era in human history and predicted that the future world would inevitably be a world of red flags. From a patriotic standpoint, he transitioned from democracy to communism and began to bravely fight for the realization of socialist ideals in China.

Li Dazhao was the earliest propagator of Marxism in China. When feudal warlords banned Marxism as a dangerous ideology and some bourgeois intellectuals attacked Marxism as unsuitable for China, Li Dazhao clearly pointed out that Marxism is the truth of our times, the "theory of world transformation," and also the "guiding star for saving China." He believed that Marxism is a revolutionary science, not an abstract theory or an unchanging doctrine. Chinese Marxists must seriously study Marxist theory and research how to apply it to China's current political and economic situation, and in this process, advance this science rather than engage in abstract discussions. He emphasized the importance of maintaining close ties with the people's practice because the Chinese revolutionary movement under Marxist guidance should not be a mere literary movement by a few intellectuals but a mass movement in the streets and villages. When he began to develop in the direction of Marxism, he advocated that the "intellectual class and the working class should unite," pointing out that young intellectuals must go to the laboring masses, understand their sufferings, study the causes of their sufferings, and find ways to alleviate their sufferings. Thus, he also preliminarily suggested the brilliant principle that Marxism must be combined with Chinese reality.

Li Dazhao, following Marxist theory, conducted fruitful explorations into the problems of the Chinese revolution. His series of arguments on the Chinese democratic revolution, which must be led by the proletariat, must rely on the peasants, must establish a democratic united front, and must achieve revolutionary goals through armed struggle, made the earliest and valuable contributions to the formation of the Party's theory of the new democratic revolution. At the same time, he also, based on his understanding of Marxism, sketched a blueprint for the future socialist society. He pointed out that the implementation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the public ownership of the means of production are the most fundamental characteristics of socialism, and emphasized that the socialist system will be a "new system combining universality and particularity," and that China's future socialism will have its own characteristics. He also pointed out that "socialism is about becoming rich, not poor; it is about organizing production, not destroying it"; the word "democracy" can be directly translated as the rule of the people, and only socialism can achieve true democracy for the majority; "socialism also has competition," but it is different from the competition in capitalist society that leads people to misery, and so on. These arguments, even today, still feel very familiar and inspiring. Li Dazhao also, guided by Marxism, conducted research in historical studies, legal studies, political science, educational science, ethics, and even national and women's issues, making pioneering achievements in these fields. Li Dazhao's propaganda and interpretation of Marxism influenced and educated the early generation of Chinese communists. Due to historical limitations, Li Dazhao's arguments on some issues, as Mr. Lu Xun said, "may not be accurate by today's standards." However, as Mr. Lu Xun also said, "his writings will live forever because they are the heritage of the pioneers and a monument in the history of the revolution."

Li Dazhao was not only a learned scholar but also a outstanding warrior, with both qualities harmoniously combined in him. Once he grasped the truth, he immediately put it into action. He participated in the initiation and establishment of the Chinese Communist Party and directly led the establishment of the Party organization in the north. He also, together with other communists, led the workers' movement in the north, organized farmers' associations in various provinces in the north, and carried out the farmers' movement. He made important contributions to the establishment of the First United Front and the convening of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. The revolutionary struggles he initiated in the heartland of the Beiyang warlords' rule powerfully promoted the rise of the revolutionary high tide and the development of the Northern Expedition. He paid great attention to cultivating revolutionary cadres, sending many cadres to study military affairs and carry out military work, and played an important role in the reform of the National Army and its participation in the Northern Expedition. He also did a lot of important work in carrying out revolutionary activities among ethnic minorities. In his short life, he established immortal merits for the liberation cause of the Chinese people.

Li Dazhao fully embodied the great spirit of self-sacrifice and high moral character of communists. He dedicated everything he had to the country, to the people, and to the cause of the Party. He had an unshakable belief in communism. To achieve this lofty ideal, he truly did what he said, "bravely advancing and striving for it," "exhausting his energy and strength to achieve it," and "shedding blood and losing his head to follow it." He was modest in style, "not chasing empty dreams, not pursuing empty fame, but only seeking the truth with a serious attitude and doing solid work." He insisted on the truth, treated people kindly, united with comrades, as later generations praised, "he had no clique mentality, and he was as open as the clouds." When the revolution was in danger, he economized and sacrificed his family to help the Party's activities, aided comrades, and aided poor youth, while he himself "endured hardship and ate plain food, wore one cotton-padded garment in winter and one cotton garment in summer." In the enemy's prison, facing the torture of cruel punishments, he always kept the Party's secrets, maintained the honor of the Party and the revolution, and bravely sacrificed his life, dying a martyr for the communist cause. His great character will forever be a model for all communists and the people who believe in Marxism and dedicate themselves to the prosperity and development of the Chinese nation.

Comrades and Friends!

The revolutionary cause for which Li Dazhao fought and shed his blood has now achieved a great historical victory. The old China of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society that he hated has been buried by the people's revolution, and the new socialist China that he longed for stands proudly in the East. Li Dazhao's theoretical legacy is a precious spiritual wealth for the Chinese Communist Party and the people of all nationalities in China, and it still has practical significance for promoting the modernization of Chinese socialism.

History and reality both tell us that only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China. We must clearly recognize that hostile forces in the international arena are implementing a "peaceful evolution" strategy, attempting to undermine China's socialist system; within the country, some stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois liberalization stance are vigorously denying the socialist system, opposing the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and attempting to implement a capitalist system in China. Facing the attacks of domestic and foreign hostile forces, we need to review the arduous explorations and historical choices made by pioneers like Li Dazhao in their search for China's path to prosperity, further recognize the objective laws of modern Chinese social development, and firmly believe in socialism, carrying forward the socialist cause opened up by pioneers with their blood and lives.

The most basic experience of the Chinese revolution and construction is to adhere to the combination of Marxist universal truth and Chinese specific practice. To build socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must seriously learn and firmly adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice, which was initially suggested by Comrade Li Dazhao and later systematically and profoundly expounded and perfected by Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and many other older revolutionaries. Our socialist modernization construction and reform and opening-up cause must be guided by Marxism. We must resolutely oppose the erroneous tendency of denying Marxist basic principles and blindly worshipping Western bourgeois ideology. The vitality of Marxism lies in its constant connection with actual life and its ability to open up paths to solve various new problems encountered in practice. We must adhere to the basic principles of Marxism, deeply understand the current era, seriously study the new situations in China's construction and reform and opening-up, scientifically summarize the new experiences in various aspects of work, and strive to draw on the practical experiences and scientific and technological achievements of the people of the world today, thereby further developing Marxism under new historical conditions. Our cadres, especially high-level Party cadres, must seriously study Marxist basic theory. A cadre lacking Marxist theoretical cultivation is unlikely to be able to shoulder the various arduous and complex tasks he faces. We must strive to cultivate and train a large number of young Marxists. They should have a solid theoretical foundation and a broad vision, be closely connected with the masses, understand the national conditions of China, and consciously follow the principle of combining theory with practice to carry out creative work. If we do not propose and solve this task, our Party will not have a strong reserve force and will not be able to march towards the future victoriously. This is a strategic issue of great significance for whether our socialist cause can be sustained and developed, and it must be highly valued by all Party comrades.

The socialist cause is a great and arduous undertaking that requires the strong leadership of a Marxist party and the unremitting efforts of several generations to explore and struggle. To strengthen Party building, especially the Party's ideological and theoretical building, and to cultivate the talents needed for the socialist cause who have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, we should advocate learning from the firm beliefs and noble moral character of revolutionary pioneers like Li Dazhao among all Party members and the broad masses of the people, especially the younger generation. We should inherit and carry forward the Party's fine traditions, resist and eliminate the decadent thoughts and spiritual garbage of capitalism and feudalism, and strive to promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. Comrade Mao Zedong once said that people must have some spirit. Whether in the struggle to overthrow the old world or in the struggle to build a new world, maintaining and carrying forward this political and ideological advantage has always been an important guarantee for the victory of our cause.

Comrades and Friends!

Seventy years ago, when Li Dazhao first raised the banner of Marxism in the dark clouds of China, only a few people in our country accepted communist ideas; when the Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1921, the Party had only a few dozen members. However, Li Dazhao and other pioneers were convinced that their cause conformed to the laws of social development and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people, had a broad future, and could not be defeated by any reactionary forces. Practice has proven that their firm belief in the inevitable victory of socialism in China is completely justified, while those in the Party who lose confidence in the future of socialism and communism when encountering difficulties or setbacks have made historical mistakes. We believe that as long as all Party comrades and the people of the whole country inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of pioneers like Li Dazhao, adhere to the Party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," seriously summarize experiences and lessons, rectify mistakes in work, and dare to open up and make progress, we will surely be able to overcome the difficulties in the way forward and lead the socialist modernization construction and the reform and opening-up cause in the socialist direction to new and greater victories. The future of socialist China is limitless and bright.

The glorious image of Comrade Li Dazhao will forever inspire us to forge ahead! Comrade Li Dazhao will forever live in the hearts of all Communist Party members and the people of the whole country!

　　在李大钊诞辰一百周年纪念大会上
　　江泽民总书记的讲话
　　（一九八九年十月二十八日）
　　同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们在这里隆重集会，纪念李大钊同志诞辰100周年。
    李大钊是中国共产主义运动的先驱、伟大的马克思主义者、杰出的无产阶级革命家、中国共产党的主要创始人之一。
    70年前，他开始在中国政治舞台上展开积极活动。当时，一方面，帝国主义、封建主义的压迫，给中国各族人民带来深重的灾难，仁人志士为挽救祖国危亡进行的斗争，包括资产阶级改良派领导的戊戌维新运动和资产阶级革命派领导的辛亥革命，先后遭到失败，资本主义的建国方案已经在实践中宣告破产。另一方面，随着资本主义经济的初步发展，中国开始出现一个壮大了的由工人阶级、学生群众和民族资产阶级组成的革命营垒，一场新的人民大革命正在酝酿之中。俄国十月革命的成功，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义。李大钊顺应时代的需要，率先在中国大地上高举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，为中国昭示了新的社会主义的发展方向。作为中国共产党早期的卓越领导人，他在中国革命的许多条战线上进行过英勇的斗争，做出了重大的贡献。他在中国共产主义运动中，在中国人民的民族解放和社会解放事业中，占有崇高的历史地位。
    李大钊是一个伟大的爱国者。同当时中国许多先进分子一样，他曾经一度向西方资本主义国家寻求救国救民的真理，希望通过发展资本主义的经济关系和实行资本主义国家的代议政治，来治疗中国社会的痼疾。但是，他在实践中感到，西方资产阶级启蒙学者所宣传的理性王国，并不能保证正义、平等、人权的实现，特别是第一次世界大战的爆发，更进一步暴露了资本主义制度内在的不可克服的矛盾。所有这一切，都促使他坚信资本主义的建国方案在中国是行不通的。他认为，俄国十月革命开创了人类历史的新纪元，预言将来之寰球“必是赤旗的世界”。他从爱国主义的立场出发，经过民主主义而走向共产主义，开始为在中国实现社会主义理想而英勇奋斗。
    李大钊是马克思主义在中国的最早传播者。当封建军阀把马克思主义当作洪水猛兽加以禁绝，一些资产阶级知识分子攻击马克思主义不适合中国国情的时候，李大钊旗帜鲜明地指出，马克思主义是我们时代的真理，是“世界改造原动的学说”，也是“拯救中国的导星”。他认为，马克思主义是革命的科学，而不是抽象的学理和不变的教条，中国马克思主义者必须认真研究马克思主义的理论，研究它“怎样应用于中国今日的政治经济情形”，并在这个过程中把这门科学推向前进，而不应“偏于纸上空谈”，要“向实际的方面去作”。他指出，重要的是必须同人民群众的实践保持密切的联系，因为马克思主义指导下的中国革命运动，绝不应当只是少数文人的笔墨运动，而应当是街市上、乡村里的群众运动。当他开始向马克思主义方向发展时，就主张“知识阶级与劳工阶级打成一气”，指出知识青年必须到劳动群众中去，了解他们的痛苦，研究他们痛苦的原因，寻找解脱他们痛苦的方法。这样，他也就初步提示了马克思主义必须同中国实际相结合这一光辉的思想原则。
    李大钊遵循马克思主义理论，对中国革命问题进行了富有成效的探索。他关于中国的民主革命必须由无产阶级领导、必须依靠农民、必须建立民主的联合战线、必须通过武装斗争达到革命目标等一系列论述，对于党的新民主主义革命理论的形成做出了最早的宝贵贡献。与此同时，他还根据自己对马克思主义的理解，对未来社会主义社会的蓝图进行描绘。他指出实行无产阶级专政和生产资料公有制是社会主义共同具有的最根本的特征，而且强调，社会主义制度将是“共性与特性结合的一种新制度”，中国将来的社会主义也会有自己的特性。他还指出，“社会主义是要富的，不是要穷的，是整理生产的，不是破坏生产的”；“民主”一词可直译为人民的统治，只有社会主义才能实现真正的、大多数人的民主；“社会主义亦有相当的竞争”，只是不同于资本主义社会那种“使人类入于悲惨之境”的竞争，等等。这些论述，我们今天读来仍然感到十分亲切，并能从中得到启发。李大钊还以马克思主义为指导，对历史学、法学、政治学、教育学、伦理学乃至民族问题、妇女问题等进行过研究，在这些领域中做出了开拓性的建树。李大钊对马克思主义的宣传和阐述，影响和教育了我国早期的一代共产党人。由于历史条件的限制，李大钊对一些问题的论述，正如鲁迅先生所说的，“在现在看起来，当然未必精当的”。然而，也正如鲁迅先生所说，“他的遗文却将永住，因为这是先驱者的遗产，革命史上的丰碑”。
    李大钊不仅是渊博的学者，而且首先是杰出的战士，学者和战士两种品格在他身上和谐地结合在一起。他一旦掌握了真理，就立即将它付诸行动。他参与了中国共产党的发起和创建工作，并直接领导创建了北方的党组织。他还同其他共产党人一起领导了北方的工人运动，在北方各省广泛组织农民协会，开展农民运动。他为第一次国共合作的建立和国民党第一次全国代表大会的召开，做出了重要的贡献。他在北洋军阀统治的心脏地区发动的革命斗争，有力地推动了大革命高潮的兴起和北伐战争的发展。他很重视培养革命干部，派遣许多干部去学习军事、开展军队工作，并对国民军的改造和参加北伐起了重要的促进作用。他还为在少数民族中开展革命活动，做了许多重要的工作。他在自己短暂的一生中，为中国人民的解放事业建立了不朽的功勋。
    在李大钊的身上，充分地体现了共产主义者的伟大的献身精神和高尚的道德情操，他把自己的一切毫无保留地献给了祖国，献给了人民，献给了党的事业。他对共产主义具有无比坚定的信念。为了实现这个崇高的理想，他真正做到了自己所说的，“勇往奋进以赴之”，“瘅精瘁力以成之”，“断头流血以从之”。他作风质朴，“不驰于空想，不骛于虚声，而惟以求真的态度作踏实的工夫”。他坚持真理，待人宽厚，团结同志，正如后人所赞誉的，“没有宗派气，内外从如云”。当革命处于危难时刻，他节衣缩食，毁家纾难，把个人收入的大部分用来充作党的活动经费，接济同志，接济贫苦青年，而自己却“茹苦食淡，冬一絮衣，夏一布衫”。在敌人的监狱中，面对酷刑的折磨，他始终严守党的秘密，维护党和革命的荣誉，直至舍生赴死，从容就义，为共产主义事业献出宝贵的生命。他的伟大的人格，永远是一切信仰马克思主义、立志为中华民族的兴旺发达而献身的共产党人和人民群众学习的楷模。
    同志们，朋友们！
    李大钊当年曾经为之奋斗、流血牺牲的革命事业，如今已经取得了伟大的历史性的胜利。他所憎恨的半殖民地半封建的旧中国已经被人民革命所埋葬，他所殷切盼望的社会主义的新中国已经巍然屹立在世界的东方。李大钊的思想理论遗产，是中国共产党和中国各族人民的宝贵精神财富，对于推动我国社会主义现代化建设，仍然具有现实意义。
    历史的经验和现实的生活都告诉我们，只有社会主义才能救中国，只有社会主义才能发展中国。我们必须清醒地认识到，国际上的敌对势力正在推行“和平演变”的战略，企图搞垮中国的社会主义制度；国内一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，极力否定社会主义制度，反对中国共产党的领导，企图在中国实行资本主义制度。面对国内外敌对势力的进攻，我们有必要重温李大钊等先驱者为寻找中国富强之路所进行的艰难探索和做出的历史选择，进一步认清现代中国社会发展的客观规律，坚定对于社会主义的信念，把先驱者用鲜血和生命开辟的社会主义事业进行到底。
    中国革命和建设的最基本的经验，是坚持马克思主义普遍真理同中国具体实践相结合。为了建设有中国特色的社会主义，我们必须认真学习和切实坚持由李大钊同志初步提示，其后由毛泽东同志、邓小平同志和许多老一辈革命家系统而深刻地加以阐明和完善的理论与实际相结合的原则。我们的社会主义现代化建设和改革开放事业，必须以马克思主义为指导。我们要坚决反对那种否定马克思主义基本原理、盲目崇拜西方资产阶级思潮的错误倾向。马克思主义的生命力，在于它始终同实际生活保持着密切的联系，在于它能够为解决实践中遇到的各种新问题开辟道路。我们一定要遵循马克思主义的基本原理，深刻了解当前的时代，认真研究我国建设和改革开放的新情况，科学概括各方面工作的新经验，努力汲取当代世界各国人民的实践经验和科学技术的新成果，并由此使马克思主义在新的历史条件下得到进一步的发展。我们的干部尤其是党的高级干部，都要认真学习马克思主义基本理论。一个缺乏马克思主义理论修养的干部，是不可能担当起他所面临的各种艰难、复杂的任务的。我们必须努力培养和造就一大批青年马克思主义者。他们应该具有较深厚的理论修养和较广阔的视野，密切联系群众，懂得中国国情，自觉根据理论同实际相结合的原则，创造性地开展工作。如果不提出并解决这个任务，我们的党就不可能有坚强的后备队，就不可能胜利地走向未来。这是我们的社会主义事业能否长久地坚持和发展下去的一个具有战略意义的大问题，必须引起全党同志的高度重视。
    社会主义事业是伟大而艰巨的事业，需要马克思主义政党的坚强领导，需要几代人坚持不懈地进行艰苦的探索和奋斗。为了加强党的建设特别是党的思想理论建设，为了造就社会主义事业所需要的有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的人才，我们应当在全体共产党员和广大人民群众尤其是青年一代中，提倡学习李大钊等革命先辈的坚定的信念和高尚的道德情操，继承和发扬党的优良传统，抵制和扫除资本主义、封建主义的腐朽思想和精神垃圾，努力推进社会主义精神文明建设。毛泽东同志说过，人总是要有一点精神的。无论是在推翻旧世界的斗争还是在建设新世界的斗争中，保持和发扬这种政治上、思想上的优势，始终是我们的事业取得胜利的重要保证之一。
    同志们，朋友们！
    70年前，当李大钊在黑暗笼罩的中国最早举起马克思主义旗帜的时候，我国接受共产主义思想的只有很少几个人；当1921年中国共产党成立的时候，党的队伍中也只有几十名成员。但是，李大钊等先驱者确信自己的事业符合社会发展的规律和广大人民的根本利益，有着广阔的前途，是任何反动力量不能战胜的。实践证明，他们对于社会主义在中国必将胜利的坚定信念是完全有根据的，而党内那种遇到困难或挫折就对社会主义、共产主义前途丧失信心的人，则是犯了历史性的错误。我们相信，只要全党同志和全国人民继承、发扬李大钊等先驱者的革命精神，坚持党的“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线，认真总结经验教训，切实纠正工作中的失误，勇于开拓进取，就一定能够克服前进中的困难，把我国的社会主义现代化建设和坚持社会主义方向的改革开放事业引向新的更大的胜利。社会主义中国的前途是无限光明的。
    李大钊同志的光辉形象永远激励我们奋勇前进！李大钊同志永远活在我们全体共产党员和全国人民心中！　（新华社发）
