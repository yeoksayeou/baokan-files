The main task of the American news media is to mobilize the American public to support the fundamental interests of the government and private economy. The media giants claim that their standards for evaluating news are objective. However, our years of research show that these giants are fully capable of controlling the main tone of news debates, deciding what the people see and hear, and influencing public opinion through organized propaganda campaigns.

The American news corps are carefully selected. Reporters and commentators have the mindset and biases that the government needs, thus creating non-objective news reports. News censorship is basically "self-censorship" by reporters and commentators, that is, their understanding of adapting to "objective reality." Of course, there are also more important figures who directly intervene in the content and form of news reports to prevent the news from getting out of control.

The news media are not always in tune. When the views of the news leaders diverge, it will be reflected in the news reports. But views that challenge the basic national policy are always avoided in the news. For example, when Somoza (the former dictator of Nicaragua, who was overthrown in 1979) firmly held power, the United States was not interested in Nicaragua's democracy. Now, however, the news media are very concerned about the U.S. government's worries about the "democratic" fate of this country.

How the news media report and analyze a specific fact should be of more concern to us. This refers to the news media's likes and dislikes, tone, and the frequency of repeating these materials. The American news media always benefit the rulers by covering up facts, choosing appropriate reporting tones and angles, and skillfully timing the reports. For example, the American news media pay a lot of attention to the mistakes of communism, trying to make people believe in the evil of communism. However, people ignore the fact that the American news media have always been silent about the mistakes of the American satellite countries.

The White House, the Pentagon, and the State Department are the centers of national news activities in the United States. At the local level, state governments and police stations are the regular sources of news for reporters. Government agencies and large companies maintain close ties with the news media. For example, the Pentagon has a social information service organization that spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year. In the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Air Force alone provided information about its activities to 140 newspapers, 34 radio stations, and 17 television stations; issued 615,000 news releases, conducted 6,600 interviews, including 3,200 press conferences. During this period, the Air Force flew more than 500 flights for news purposes. Only the government and financial groups have the ability to conduct such large-scale news propaganda activities. The rulers can use personal relationships and other means to influence the news media. The latter also knows that it has the obligation to publish the materials provided by the government to avoid offending these sources of information. When a person has to rely on the authorities to obtain a large amount of information, it is difficult for him to call the authorities liars, even if the authorities spread very obvious lies.

    美国：新闻自由的神话
    ——美国学者吉尔曼、乔姆斯基谈美国的新闻导向
    美国新闻媒介的主要任务在于动员美国公众支持政府和私有经济的根本利益。新闻巨头们声称，他们评价新闻的标准是客观的。然而，我们的多年研究表明，这些巨头们完全有能力把握新闻争论中的主调，决定让人民看到什么，听到什么，并通过组织经常性的宣传运动影响社会舆论。
    美国的新闻队伍是经过挑选的。记者和评论家们具有政府所需要的思维方式和偏见，从而造成了新闻报道的非客观性。新闻检查基本上是记者和评论家的“自我检查”，即他们所理解的对“客观现实”的适应。当然，也有一些更重要的人物直接插手新闻报道的内容和形式，以防新闻舆论失控。
    新闻界并不总是一个调子。当新闻界领袖们的观点发生分歧时，会在新闻报道中有所反映。但那些对基本国策提出挑战的观点总是避免在新闻中出现。以对尼加拉瓜的报道为例，当索摩查（亲美的尼前独裁者，1979年被推翻——译者注）牢牢把握政权时，美国对尼加拉瓜的民主并不感兴趣。而现在，新闻界却倍加关注美国政府对这个国家“民主”命运的忧虑。
    新闻媒介如何报道、分析一个具体事实更应当引起我们注意。这里指的是新闻媒介的好恶态度、基调以及重复这些材料的频率，美国新闻媒介总是通过掩盖事实、选择适当报道基调和角度、巧妙把握报道时机等方式给执政者带来好处。譬如，美国新闻媒介很注意共产主义的过错，企图让人们相信共产主义的罪恶。然而，人们却忽视了美国新闻界一直对美国附庸国的过错保持沉默。
    白宫、五角大楼和国务院是美国全国性新闻活动的中心。在地方，州政府和警察局则是新闻记者获得消息的经常性来源。政府机构和大公司与新闻界保持着密切的联系。譬如，五角大楼设有一个社会信息服务机构，每年耗资数亿美元。七八十年代，仅美国空军就向140家报纸、34家电台和17家电视台提供了有关活动的情况；共发了61.5万份新闻通报，接受采访6600次，其中包括3200个记者招待会。其间，空军以新闻为目的的飞行多达500次。只有政府和财团才有能力从事这样大规模的新闻宣传活动。当权者可以利用私人关系等手段向新闻界施加影响。后者也清楚，它有义务发表政府提供的材料以免得罪这些消息来源。当一个人不得不依靠当局获得大量信息时，他便很难把当局说成骗子，即使当局散播出十分明显的谎言。古井摘译自苏联《真理报》
