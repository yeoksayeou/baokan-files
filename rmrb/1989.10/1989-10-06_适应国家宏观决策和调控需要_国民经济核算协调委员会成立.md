The National Economic Accounting Coordination Committee Established

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th - (Reporter Zhang Chao Wen) The National Economic Accounting Coordination Committee was established in Beijing today.

This is an inter-ministerial consultative and advisory body approved by the State Council to establish a scientific, unified, coordinated, and complete national economic accounting system. This is to meet the needs of national macroeconomic decision-making and to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and management.

With the deepening of reform and opening up, China's original national economic accounting system can no longer meet the needs of national macroeconomic management. In 1984, the State Council approved the establishment of the State Council's Leading Group for Unified National Economic Accounting Standards. Over the past four years, a preliminary plan for China's new national economic accounting system has been formulated and pilot calculations have been conducted in nine provinces and cities since last year, achieving good results. To unify the leadership of the reform of the national economic accounting system and to continuously improve China's new national economic accounting system, relevant departments of the State Council have consulted and reported to the State Council for the establishment of this committee. The National Economic Accounting Coordination Committee is composed of the State Statistical Bureau, the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Reform Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, and the State Bureau of Industry and Commerce.

    适应国家宏观决策和调控需要
    国民经济核算协调委员会成立
    新华社北京10月5日电　（记者张超文）全国国民经济核算协调委员会今日在京成立。
    这是国务院为建立科学、统一、协调、完整的国民经济核算体系，以适应国家宏观决策和加强宏观调控与管理的需要，而批准成立的国务院部际专项工作的协商、咨询组织。
    随着改革开放的不断深入，我国原有的国民经济核算体系已不能适应国家对经济宏观管理的需要。1984年，国务院批准成立了国务院国民经济统一核算标准领导小组。4年多来，组织制订了我国新的国民经济核算体系初步方案，并于去年开始在9个省、市进行试点试算，取得良好效果。为了统一领导国民经济核算体系的改革工作，使我国新国民经济核算制度不断完善，国务院有关部门经过协商，报请国务院批准成立了这一委员会。全国国民经济核算协调委员会由国家统计局、国家计委、国家体改委、国家科委、财政部、中国人民银行、国家技术监督局和国家工商局等组成。
