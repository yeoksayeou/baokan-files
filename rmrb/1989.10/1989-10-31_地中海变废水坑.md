A recent article published by the Yugoslav News Agency stated that the Mediterranean Sea has become one of the most polluted seas in the world.

Eighty-five percent of the wastewater from 120 cities along the Mediterranean coast is discharged into the sea. Experts estimate that annually, approximately 120,000 tons of oil and oil products, 12,000 tons of phenol, 60,000 tons of detergent, 100 tons of mercury, 3,000 tons of lead, 320,000 tons of phosphorus, 800,000 tons of nitrates, and 120,000 tons of mineral oil are discharged into the Mediterranean.

The Mediterranean Sea's water can only exchange with the Atlantic Ocean through the narrow Strait of Gibraltar, making the natural renewal of its water extremely slow.

　　地中海变废水坑
    南斯拉夫通讯社不久前发表的一篇文章说，地中海已成为世界上污染最严重的海洋之一。
    地中海沿岸一百二十个城市的百分之八十五废水都注入地中海。据专家们估计，每年约有十二万吨石油和石油产品，一点二万吨酚、六万吨洗衣粉、一百吨水银、三千吨铅、三十二万吨磷、八十万吨硝酸盐和十二万吨矿物油注入地中海。
    地中海的海水只能通过狭窄的直布罗陀海峡同大西洋沟通，因此海水的自然更新非常缓慢。
