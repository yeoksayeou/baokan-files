The World Women's Tennis Team Championship concluded today in the afternoon at the Ariake Tennis Forest Park in Tokyo. The U.S. team defeated Spain 3-0 in the final, securing the championship for the thirteenth time. Spain took the runner-up position.

The U.S. team, featuring star players such as Evonne Goolagong and Martina Navratilova, dominated the competition, defeating last year's champion Czechoslovakia to reach the final. The Spanish team, led by rising star Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, overcame a strong Australian team to advance to the final. In today's final, the match between Navratilova and Sánchez Vicario reached its climax. Sánchez Vicario took the first set 6-0. Navratilova, known for her aggressive net play, had to switch to a baseline strategy to find opportunities, eventually winning the next two sets 6-3 and 6-4 to secure the victory.

The Chinese team, competing in the B group, won against Luxembourg and Greece but lost to Sweden in their third match, failing to advance to the top four of the B group.
