Sima Yi Aimatiji, the head of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, today called on all ethnic minority students to study Jiang Zemin's important speech on National Day, unify their thoughts, and firmly uphold the four cardinal principles. They should also strengthen their confidence in the socialist cause and strive to become a new generation of people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

This afternoon, Sima Yi Aimatiji visited the Central Institute for Nationalities to meet with students and staff from various ethnic minorities. He held a discussion with representatives from 46 ethnic groups and studied Jiang Zemin's important speech on National Day together.

Sima Yi Aimatiji said during the discussion that ethnic minority youth bear a double burden: one is to build a modernized country, and the other is to achieve the revitalization of all ethnic groups. Ethnic youth should strive to achieve greatness in the grand cause of revitalizing China and building the motherland.

He said that ethnic minority students must resolutely safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, which is a concrete manifestation of patriotism today. Currently, anti-China and anti-communist forces abroad, along with those who have fled the country to promote bourgeois liberalization, use the disruption of our country's unity and ethnic solidarity as a means of subversion, infiltration, and sabotage. We must be vigilant and take this seriously.

During the discussion, Sima Yi Aimatiji encouraged students from all ethnic groups to set high standards and strict requirements for themselves, study diligently, and master modern scientific and cultural knowledge. This will enable them to become useful talents for the cause of China's modernization.

At the discussion, leaders of the Institute for Nationalities, including Ren Shiqi and Luo Bingsheng, shared the important gains from studying Jiang Zemin's speech. Some student representatives also shared their insights from studying the speech.

　　司马义·艾买提要求各民族师生
　　用江泽民国庆讲话统一思想
    新华社北京10月28日电  （记者格来）国家民委主任司马义·艾买提今天在与中央民院师生座谈时要求广大师生认真学习江泽民同志的国庆重要讲话，统一思想，自觉坚持四项基本原则，坚定对社会主义事业的信心，努力使自己成为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人。
    今天下午，国家民委主任司马义·艾买提到中央民族学院看望各民族师生员工，并同46个民族成分的师生代表举行座谈，和大家一起学习、讨论江泽民同志的国庆重要讲话。
    司马义·艾买提在座谈时说，少数民族青年肩负两副重担：一副是建设现代化国家，一副是实现各民族的振兴。各族青年应在振兴中华，建设祖国的伟大事业中建功立业。
    他说，各民族学生要坚决维护祖国统一和民族团结，这是今天爱国主义的具体表现。当前国外反华反共势力、逃亡国外的搞资产阶级自由化的人，把破坏我们国家的统一和民族团结，作为他们进行颠覆、渗透、破坏的一种手段。对此我们必须提高警惕，认真对待。
    在座谈中司马义·艾买提勉励各族师生，要高标准、严要求，刻苦学习，掌握现代科学文化知识，使自己成为祖国四化建设事业的有用人才。
