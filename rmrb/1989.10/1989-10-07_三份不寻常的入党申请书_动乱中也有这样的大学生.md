Shortly after the start of the new semester, the Party organization at Southwest Jiaotong University received applications for Party membership from three students in the class of 1987. The three applications were written in May and June. Upon hearing the news, the author interviewed the three applicants and learned about their unique thoughts during the turmoil.

Wu Weidong, a 21-year-old from Guangdong, said: “The night before the big student march in Chengdu, the dormitory area suddenly became lively, with people breaking bottles and making noise. As the class monitor, I asked all the classmates to stay calm. As a result, our class did not join in and went to bed according to the school's schedule.

“The next day, when the marchers gathered, I saw that the banners were all against corruption and official profiteering, which I fully agreed with, so I joined the march. During the march, I saw many people being disrespectful and disorderly. Later, I saw some banners with personal attacks, which made me feel uncomfortable and confused. After that, I did not participate in any more marches or other supportive activities. I insisted on going to the classroom to study every day and calmly thinking about everything that was happening in the country. I was worried about the future and fate of the country, fearing that the country would fall into chaos and that the achievements of ten years of reform and the blood of millions of martyrs would be in vain. But I also firmly believed that our Party is a great party, and our government is a people's government. It will take decisive measures to solve all problems. Finally, on June 3 and 4, the Central Committee made the correct decision to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, ending this prolonged turmoil.

“A few people incited students to boycott classes, and I returned to my hometown in Guangdong with a worried heart. My father, an old Communist Party member, with deep feelings for the Party, repeatedly reminded me to listen to the Party. He said, ‘Guangdong people have a strong economic sense. Others have their own enjoyment, but we have our own pursuits.’ My father has been ‘old-fashioned’ all his life. He worked in the Forestry Bureau and did not ‘profit’ even though he could. He is poor but upright. He is the person I admire the most. My father's love for the Party and his pursuit of the socialist cause have had a great influence on me. During my time at home, I also borrowed party history materials from my father to study seriously and reviewed the content of the party classes taught by my teachers. I think that a person's life must have a spiritual pillar to guide his words and deeds, just like my father. After more than ten days, I returned to school and solemnly wrote an application for Party membership to the Party organization.”

Yan Bo, a 19-year-old from Hunan, said: “After the student movement began, ‘multi-party system’ became a hot topic. Whenever I encountered such remarks, I would argue with them. I said that China is such a large country; without the cohesive force of the Communist Party, it would be like a loose sand. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we achieve the modernization of socialist China.

“On May 17, I also participated in the big student march in Chengdu. When the procession reached a construction site, a worker on the top of the building waved a blanket, which also caused a great cheer from the marching crowd. Later, someone suggested storming the provincial government, and I felt more and more inappropriate, so I pretended to go to the toilet and returned to school. After that, I did not go out again and also persuaded other classmates not to go. I risked being called a ‘traitor’ and secretly carried books under my coat to the classroom to study. Later, I was the first in the class to resume classes, for which I was subjected to cold remarks and even personal attacks from some classmates.

“During the turmoil, when someone proposed to withdraw from the League, I thought, they withdraw, I join the Party. At this time, I began to draft my application for Party membership. I thought of my father—a veteran intellectual—who was unusually excited on the day he joined the Party. He said, ‘I have no regrets in this life.’ These words left a deep impression on me. The road my parents took is also the road I will take. After returning home during the school closure, I had more time, so I took up my pen and formally wrote my application for Party membership.

“For a long time, I felt that there were many things I wanted to say. In the political study after the opening of the school, I took the lead in speaking out enthusiastically and poured out the feelings of supporting the Party and socialism that had been bottled up in my heart, and I felt very relieved.”

Fan Yongquan, a 20-year-old from a rural area in Liaoning, said: “In my first year of university, I read about the deeds of an excellent student, Du Yi, in the Liaoning Daily, and I silently decided to be a young person like Du Yi. I carefully copied the long report, filling 16 pages of letter paper, and drew a title that was not very beautiful but very detailed. I bound it and placed it in a prominent place on my bookshelf. He said: ‘After the Chengdu student march began, there were almost no students left on campus during the day, including me. We insisted on attending classes. For the first two days, it was still possible, but later there were really few people attending classes, and the teacher could only let us study by ourselves. After the school stopped classes, I also went to the city center to see, and I experienced half an hour in the marching crowd. Seeing the streets crowded and the People's South Road Square messy and dirty, I felt very uncomfortable. During that time, students' emotions were obviously opposed to the Central Committee, and only the news from Tiananmen Square and ‘Voice of America’ were freely circulated everywhere. At that time, I agreed with Professor Yuan Mu's words: ‘More calmness, more thinking.’ Must we participate in the march to be patriotic?”

“My parents said that even a family, when living together, should discuss and help each other, and the family will be prosperous, let alone a country with 1/5 of the world's population? I deeply felt sorry for the impulsiveness of the university students. In my first year of university, I wrote an application for Party membership. During this student movement, my belief in the Party has always been my spiritual pillar. On May 4, I wrote my second application for Party membership. I wrote, ‘My understanding of the Communist Party of China, from primary school, middle school to university, can be said to be deeper and deeper every year. I understand that the corrupt behavior of a few individuals certainly cannot represent the whole Party, and besides, our Party has always advocated seeking truth from facts and correcting mistakes. I believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our reform will surely succeed. Just as the ideal of communism is our highest ideal.’”

The thoughts of the three classmates during the turmoil are worth our deep reflection. Why, among the young university students, did some fall so deeply into deception, while others could distinguish right from wrong? At least one reason is that they always had a spiritual pillar in their hearts. Their feelings and stance towards the Party and socialist motherland were more firm. Young friends, let us calmly reflect on ourselves!

### 三份不寻常的入党申请书——动乱中也有这样的大学生

    三份不寻常的入党申请书
    ——动乱中也有这样的大学生
    西南交通大学　张涛
    开学不久，西南交通大学党组织收到了三名87级学生的入党申请书，三份申请书分别写于5月和6月。笔者闻讯后访问了三位申请人，了解到他们在动乱中独立不群的思想脉络。
    21岁的武卫东，广东人，他说：“成都学生大游行的前一天晚上，宿舍区忽然热闹起来，又是摔瓶子又是起哄。我作为班长，要求全班同学保持冷静，结果我们班没闹，按学校的作息要求熄灯睡觉了。
    “第二天游行队伍集合的时候，我看到标语上写的都是反对官倒、腐败，这也是我深表赞同的，就加入了游行的队伍。在游行途中，我看到不少人不严肃，不守纪律，后来又看到一些进行人身攻击的标语，就有点反感，同时觉得困惑。在这以后的游行和其它声援活动，我就再也没参加了。我坚持每天上教室自习，同时冷静地思考着国家发生的一切。我为国家的前途、命运担忧，害怕全国大乱，害怕十年改革的成就、几千万先烈用鲜血换来的人民共和国将毁于一旦。但我又坚信我们的党是伟大的党，我们的政府是人民的政府，是会果断采取措施解决一切问题的。终于在6月3日、4日，中央作出正确决策一举平息了北京发生的反革命暴乱，结束了这场旷日持久的动乱。
    “极少数人鼓动学生搞空校，上不了课，我带着忐忑不安的心情回了广东老家。我父亲，一个老共产党员，怀着对党的深厚感情，再次告诫我要听党的话。他说，广东人经济观念强，别人有别人的享受，但我们有我们的追求。父亲一辈子‘古板’，他在林业局任职，能‘倒’而不‘倒’，一身清贫，一身正气。他是我最敬慕的人。父亲对党的热爱、对社会主义事业的追求给我的影响非常大。在家的日子里，我还从父亲那里借来党史资料认真学习，重温老师在上党课时所讲的内容。我想，人的一生必须要像父亲那样有一个精神支柱，用以统帅自己的言行。十多天后我返回学校，向党组织郑重地写了入党申请书。”19岁的湖南人颜波说：“学潮开始后，‘多党制’成了热门话题。每当遇上这种言论，我都据理力争。我说，中国这么大的国家，若无共产党的核心凝聚力，必然形同一盘散沙。只有在共产党的领导下，才能实现社会主义中国的现代化。
    “5月17日成都市学生大游行，我也去了。队伍行至一个建筑工地，楼顶上一个工人拿着一张毯子乱舞，也引起游行队伍的一片欢呼。后来有人提出要冲击省政府，我越来越觉得不合适，就借故上厕所回校了，以后便再也没出去，还劝其他同学也别去了。我冒着当‘学贼’的风险，把书掖在外衣里偷偷上教室自习，后来又在全班第一个复课，为此遭到了一些同学的冷言冷语甚至人身攻击。
    “动乱中当有人提出要退团时，我想，他们退团，我偏入党。就在这时，我开始构思自己的入党申请书。我想起了我父亲——一位老知识分子，在入党那天他回到家里异常兴奋，他说，我这辈子死而无憾了。这话留给我的印象极深。父辈走过的路也是我将要走的路。空校回家后，时间比较充裕，我提笔正式写了自己的入党申请书。
    “很久了，我觉得有很多话憋在心里。在开学后的政治学习中，我带头踊跃发言，把压在心底拥护党、拥护社会主义的感情倾泻而出，心里非常痛快。”
    20岁的范永泉来自辽宁农村。大学一年级的时候他读了《辽宁日报》上登载的优秀大学生杜忆的事迹后，便默默地下决心做一个像杜忆那样的青年。他工工整整地把那长篇通讯抄录下来，密密地抄了16页信笺，还画了一个不算漂亮却很精细的标题，并把它装订起来，放在书架上显眼的地方。他说：“成都大学生游行开始之后，白天在校的同学所剩无几，其中就有我，我们坚持上课。头两天还可以，后来上课的人实在没几个了，老师只能让我们自学。学校停课后我也到市中心去看过，到游行队伍中去体会了半小时。看到街道被挤得水泄不通，人民南路广场上弄得很脏很乱，我心里很不是滋味。那一段时间，学生情绪明显与中央对立，只有天安门广场的消息和‘美国之音’畅行无阻到处传播。我当时赞成袁木老师的一句话：‘多一点冷静，多一点思考。’难道非得参加游行才算爱国吗？”
    “父母说过，就是一个家庭，过日子也要相互商量着，互相帮助，家庭才能富足，更何况一个拥有世界1／5人口的大国呢？我深深地为大学生们的冲动而难过。大学一年级的时候，我写了入党申请书。这次学潮中，对党的信念一直是我的精神支柱。5月4日，我写了第二份入党申请书。我写道，‘我对于中国共产党的认识，从小学、中学到大学，可以说一年比一年深刻。我懂得，个别几个人有腐败行为毕竟不能代表全党，何况我们党历来主张实事求是，有错必改。我相信，在中国共产党的领导下，我们的改革终究会成功。正如共产主义理想，终究是我们最崇高的理想。’”
    三位同学在动乱中的思想活动值得我们深思。为什么同是青年大学生，有的上当受骗那么深，有的却能明辨是非？其原因至少有一点，就是他们心中一直有一个精神支柱，他们对党对社会主义祖国的感情和立场更坚定一些。青年朋友们，让我们对照自己冷静地想一想吧！
