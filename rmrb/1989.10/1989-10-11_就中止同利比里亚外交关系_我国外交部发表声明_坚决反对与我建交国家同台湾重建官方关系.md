	China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement on Suspension of Diplomatic Relations with Liberia
	Firmly Opposes Countries with Diplomatic Ties to China from Establishing Official Relations with Taiwan

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement today regarding the suspension of diplomatic relations between China and Liberia. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On October 2nd, 1989, the government of Liberia announced the resumption of "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan and signed a joint communiqué on the resumption of "diplomatic relations" on October 9th. The Chinese Ambassador to Liberia had been instructed to repeatedly protest to the Liberian government regarding the Taiwan authorities' activities in Liberia aimed at creating "two Chinas." However, the Liberian government ignored the Chinese government's position and insisted on its erroneous decision.

	The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The erroneous decision by the Liberian government violates the principles of the joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Liberia on February 17th, 1977, and the Liberian government's commitment to recognize the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government representing all the Chinese people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, upon instruction, announces: The Chinese government will, effective immediately, suspend diplomatic relations with Liberia. The Liberian government shall bear all consequences arising therefrom.

	China's consistent position on the Taiwan issue has been understood, respected, and supported by all countries that have established diplomatic relations with us. We firmly oppose countries that have established diplomatic relations with us from establishing or resuming official relations with Taiwan and engaging in official-level exchanges, but we do not object to economic, trade, and cultural exchanges of a purely civilian nature between them and Taiwan. The Taiwan authorities' pursuit of so-called "substantive diplomacy" to achieve "dual recognition," create "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan" is doomed to failure. The Chinese people will ultimately achieve the great cause of national reunification, which is the trend of the times and the will of the people, and no force can stop it.

	The Chinese people cherish the friendship with the Liberian people. We hope that the Liberian government, considering the long-term interests of China-Liberia relations, will correct its erroneous decision, return to the principles and positions of the joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Liberia, so that the two countries' relations can return to normal, and friendly cooperation between the two countries can continue to develop.

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th – A responsible official from the African Affairs Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Liberian Ambassador to China, John Christopher Ricks, this morning.

	The official solemnly pointed out that the Liberian government's resumption of "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan violates the principles of the joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Liberia on February 17th, 1977, and the Liberian government's commitment to recognize the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government representing all the Chinese people. Under these circumstances, the Chinese government has no choice but to suspend diplomatic relations with Liberia effective immediately.

    就中止同利比里亚外交关系
    我国外交部发表声明
    坚决反对与我建交国家同台湾重建官方关系
    新华社北京10月10日电  中华人民共和国外交部今天就中止中国同利比里亚外交关系一事发表声明。声明全文如下：
    1989年10月2日，利比里亚政府宣布与台湾重新建立“外交关系”，并于10月9日签署关于重新建立“外交关系”的联合公报。中国驻利比里亚大使曾奉命一再向利比里亚政府就台湾当局在利搞“两个中国”的活动进行了严正交涉。但是，利比里亚政府无视中国政府的立场，坚持其错误决定。
    中华人民共和国政府是中国的唯一合法政府，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。利比里亚政府的这一错误决定，违背了1977年2月17日中利建交联合公报的原则和利比里亚政府承认中华人民共和国政府是代表全中国人民的唯一合法政府的承诺。中华人民共和国外交部奉命宣布：中国政府自即日起中止同利比里亚的外交关系，由此而产生的一切后果，应由利比里亚政府承担。
    中国在台湾问题上的一贯立场，得到了世界上所有同我建交的国家的理解、尊重和支持。我们坚决反对与我建交国家同台湾建立或重新建立官方关系和进行具有官方性质的往来，对它们同台湾之间完全属于民间性质的经济贸易和文化往来则不持异议。台湾当局推行所谓“实质外交”，搞“双重承认”，制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”的图谋是绝对不可能得逞的。中国人民终究要实现祖国的统一大业，这是大势所趋，人心所向，是任何力量都不能阻挡的。
    中国人民珍视同利比里亚人民的友谊。希望利比里亚政府从中利关系的长远利益出发，纠正其错误决定，重新回到中利建交公报的原则立场上来，使两国关系得以恢复正常，两国友好合作得以继续发展。
    新华社北京10月10日电  中国外交部非洲司负责人今天上午就中国中止与利比里亚外交关系召见利比里亚驻华大使约翰·克利斯托弗·里克斯。
    这位负责人郑重指出，利比里亚政府与台湾重新“建立外交关系”，违背了1977年2月17日中利建交联合公报的原则和利比里亚政府承认中华人民共和国政府是代表全中国人民的唯一合法政府的承诺。在此情况下，中国政府不得不自即日起中止同利比里亚的外交关系。
