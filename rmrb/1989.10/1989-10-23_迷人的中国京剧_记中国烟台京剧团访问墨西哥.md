On the evening of October 16, the Yantai Peking Opera Troupe of China performed at the National Auditorium in Mexico City, once again earning high praise for Chinese art. Many audience members, when sharing their impressions with reporters, unanimously said: "Chinese Peking Opera is indeed a 'complete art'; 'perfect performance'; 'a great representative of world art.'"

This was the troupe's ninth performance in Mexico. From the opening night on October 1 in Merida, the capital of Yucatan State, the birthplace of ancient Maya culture, to the present, they have performed in eight states covering one-third of Mexico's national territory and the Federal District. They performed wherever they went. Through wind and dust, they performed and were acclaimed. Although China and Mexico are far apart, with different traditions and cultures, the audiences on this side of the ocean turned out to be connoisseurs of the traditional art from the other side, which was beyond the expectations of the artists of the Yantai Peking Opera Troupe. What domestic audiences applauded, the Mexican audiences also cheered for. Whether it was the singing and acting of civil operas or the fighting in martial operas, they were all loved by the audience.

In particular, the exaggerated makeup art in Peking Opera and martial operas like "Three Intersections," "Stealing the Immortal Grass," and "Monkey King's Havoc in Heaven" were particularly admired by the Mexican audience. Every gesture, every movement, every bow, all elicited applause from the Mexican audience.

The famous Mexican film and television star, Edith Gonzalez, known to Chinese audiences as "Bianca," told the reporter: "The strength of Western opera lies mainly in the singing. Chinese Peking Opera, however, not only has singing but also music, dance, movement, makeup, costumes, and more, all in one, showcasing a unique Eastern artistic tradition. It is a more complete art, and Chinese Peking Opera can be called a great representative of world art."

A young man named Sebastian said that Chinese Peking Opera combines acrobatics, romantic style, and mythical colors, giving people a strong aesthetic satisfaction and artistic enjoyment.

Indeed, the reporter looked around and saw that the Mexican audience was all smiles, surprise, and frequent bursts of enthusiastic applause.

Even after the performance ended, the audience was reluctant to leave, clapping and cheering again and again, and going backstage to greet the performers and take photos to commemorate the occasion.

On October 16, the Yantai Peking Opera Troupe of China, invited to participate in the 17th Cervantes International Arts Festival in Mexico, premiered "Stealing the Immortal Grass," "Watching the Pavilion by the River," and three excerpts from "Monkey King's Havoc in Heaven" in Mexico City, receiving a warm welcome from the Mexican audience.

　　迷人的中国京剧
　　——记中国烟台京剧团访问墨西哥
　　本报记者　郭伟成
    十月十六日晚上，中国烟台京剧团在墨西哥城国家会堂演出时，再次为中国艺术赢得了崇高的赞誉。许多观众在向记者谈起观感时，都不约而同地说：中国的京剧的确是一种“完整的艺术”；“完美的表演”；“世界艺术的伟大代表”。
    这已经是烟台京剧团在墨西哥的第九场演出了。从十月一日晚上在古玛雅文化发源地尤卡坦州首府梅里达的首演至今，他们在占墨西哥全国领土三分之一的八个州和首都联邦区都进行了表演。走一处，演一场。一路风尘，一路演出，一路载誉。虽然中墨两国相距遥远，传统、文化各有不同，但是，大洋此岸的墨西哥观众居然是彼岸传统艺术的知音，这是烟台京剧团的艺术家预想不到的。国内观众叫好之处，也同样得到墨西哥观众的喝采。无论文戏的唱腔、表演，还是武戏的打斗，都受到观众的喜爱。
    尤其是京剧中夸张的化妆艺术及《三岔口》、《盗仙草》、《闹天宫》等武戏，更为墨西哥观众所倾倒。一举手，一投足，一顿首，处处都博得墨西哥观众的叫好。
    墨西哥著名影视明星埃迪特·冈萨雷斯，也就是中国观众熟悉的“卞卡”对记者说：“西方歌剧的功力主要在于唱腔；而中国的京剧不仅是唱腔，还有音乐、舞蹈、动作、化妆、服饰等等集于一身，表现出独特的东方艺术传统，是一种更为完整的艺术，中国京剧堪称世界艺术的伟大代表。”
    一位叫做塞瓦斯蒂亚的青年说，中国京剧把杂技艺术、浪漫风格、神话色彩融为一体，使人得到强烈的审美满足和艺术享受。
    的确，记者环顾前后左右，墨西哥观众无不流露出欢笑之容、惊讶之情，不时爆发出热烈的掌声。
    直到演出结束，观众仍然不愿离去，一次又一次鼓掌，喝采，并到后台问候演员，合影留念。（附图片）
