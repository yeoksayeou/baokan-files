    In recent years, most advertisements for goods do not include the wholesale and retail prices, causing the public to be disappointed because they cannot "compare goods from different places" and "measure according to one's means and income." If businesspeople and commercial operators do not conduct business according to the principles of "good quality and low price" and "prominent brands with clear prices," their economic benefits will definitely be poor. Therefore, I suggest that newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and television stations, as well as individuals and units that publish and broadcast advertisements for goods, must not omit the prices of the goods when publishing and broadcasting advertisements. This will make the public happy to watch, willing to listen, widely spread, and eager to purchase the goods. Only in this way can the purpose of publishing and broadcasting advertisements for goods to promote sales be achieved.

### 商品广告应有商品价格

    商品广告应有商品价格
    近几年，多数商品广告中没有商品的批发价和零售价，使群众因不能“货比三家”和“量体裁衣”、“量入为出”而失望。企业家和商业经营者们如不按“物美价廉”和“名牌高挂，价钱当头”等生意经经商，其经济效益肯定不妙。为此，我建议报、刊、电台、电视台和刊播商品广告的单位与个人，在刊播商品广告时一定不要漏掉商品的售价，以获得群众喜欢看，乐意听，广传播，并争相购买商品。这样才能起到刊播商品广告为推销商品之目的。
