The protection of the Yunhe water resources has achieved significant results. The first batch of projects for rectification within a specified time limit have basically been completed and are now in operation, maintaining the good quality of the Yunhe water.

The Yunhe project is a large-scale inter-provincial and inter-basin water diversion project using Panjiakou Reservoir as its water source, including the diversion of the Yunhe into Tianjin and Tangshan. Located upstream of the water source in Hebei Province, the rectification tasks are heavy and the difficulties are numerous. However, they have taken the overall situation into account and actively raised funds from the provincial to municipal and county levels to implement the rectification plans within the specified time limit, thus completing the tasks relatively well. Tianjin City has also actively cooperated with Hebei Province in protecting water resources. Through the rectification, the annual discharge of wastewater in the Yunhe has been reduced by 1,030 million tons compared to the original amount, and the annual discharge of major pollutants has been reduced by 5,570 tons. At present, the water quality of Panjiakou Reservoir, Daheiting Reservoir, the Yunhe line, and the intake water quality of Tianjin's water plants all basically meet the requirements of the second-class standard for surface water environmental quality.

    引滦水资源保护有成效
    据新华社天津10月7日电　（记者窦合义）引滦水资源保护工作取得明显成果，第一批限期治理项目基本完成并发挥作用，引滦水质保持良好状态。
    引滦工程是以潘家口水库为水源的大型跨省市、跨流域引水工程，包括引滦入津和引滦入唐。地处水源上游的河北省，治理任务重，困难多，但他们从大局出发，从省到地、市、县都积极筹集资金，落实限期治理方案，较好地完成了任务。天津市也积极配合河北省做好水资源保护工作。通过治理，引滦水的废污水年排放量比原来减少1030万吨，主要污染物的年排放量减少5570吨。目前，潘家口水库、大黑汀水库、引滦沿线的水质及天津市自来水厂收水水质都基本符合地面水环境质量二级标准要求。
