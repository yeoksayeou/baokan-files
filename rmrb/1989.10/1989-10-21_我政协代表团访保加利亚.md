Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 17th.

A delegation from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), led by Ma Wenrui, was received by K. Kubadinski, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and chairman of the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, on October 17th. Both sides exchanged experiences on how broad-based political and mass organizations can participate in the management of the state and socialist construction. Both sides agreed that in the current international situation, socialist countries must persist in pushing forward socialist economic reforms without changing the socialist system of ownership, and fully exploit the advantages of socialism.

On the same day, Stanishev, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, also held a friendly meeting and conversation with Ma Wenrui.
