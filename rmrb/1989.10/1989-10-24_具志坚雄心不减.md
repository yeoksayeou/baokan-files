Chinese gymnastics enthusiasts probably still remember the famous Japanese gymnast Noriaki Kasai. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, his name was well-known. He won the men's all-around gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. This time, he served as a special commentator for Japan's NHK television station. Amidst his busy schedule, our reporter managed to interview him.

Noriaki Kasai is still as robust as ever. In September 1987, he went to West Germany to teach gymnastics at the University of Tübingen for two years. Now, he is a gymnastics instructor and national team coach at the Japan University of Sport Science, and he is married with a daughter.

As someone who has been through it all, he is very familiar with the development of gymnastics worldwide. He told the reporter, "Gymnastics is developing rapidly. If a routine on the horizontal bar could score 10 points in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, it would only get 9.7 to 9.8 points this time. There hasn't been much change in the women's events."

He praised the Chinese team highly, saying, "The Chinese team that participated in the Seoul Olympics was aging, but this time they are younger and have a higher level, with great potential and hope."

When talking about the current state of Japanese gymnastics, Noriaki Kasai said, "The Japanese team ranked third in the Olympics, but this time they fell to fourth place. The Japanese media has criticized a lot, and Japan currently lacks outstanding talents. It will take a few years to come back. His plan is to reorganize the structure of Japanese gymnastics over the next 10 years, select talents, and strive for comprehensive results in about 13 to 14 years."

　　具志坚雄心不减
　　本报记者　江建国
    中国的体操爱好者们大概都还记得日本的体操名将具志坚。他在70年代末、80年代初名声很响，曾在1984年的洛杉矶奥运会上获得男子个人全能冠军。这次大赛，他担任日本NHK电视台的特邀评议员，百忙之中，本报记者“抓住”他进行了一次采访。
    具志坚还是那么结实。他1987年9月来西德在杜宾根大学当了两年的体操讲师。现在日本体育大学担任体操讲师兼国家队教练，已经结婚，有一女儿。
    作为过来人，他对世界体操发展了如指掌。他对记者说，体操运动发展很快，1988年汉城奥运会上如果能打10分的单杠动作，这次只能打到9.7—9.8分。女子方面变化不大。
    他对中国队员大加赞赏，“中国队参加汉城奥运会的队伍老化，这次年轻多了，很有水平，很有希望。”
    具志坚在谈到日本体操现状时说，日本队在奥运会上拿第3名，这次退居第4位，日本报界批评很多，日本现在缺乏优秀的尖子，要上来还得有几年的功夫。他的计划是今后10年重整日本体操的结构，选拔人才，十三、四年之后争取全面出成果。
