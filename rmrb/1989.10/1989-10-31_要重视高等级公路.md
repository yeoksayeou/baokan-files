Title: The Importance of High-Grade Highways

Since the founding of the People's Republic, road construction has made significant progress. However, the quantity of roads is insufficient, their quality is poor, and the accident rate is high, which does not meet the needs of economic development and improving the living standards of the people. The main reasons for this situation are threefold:

First, for a long time, no effective measures have been taken to alleviate the problem of insufficient traffic capacity caused by the slower growth rate of road mileage compared to the growth rate of automobile ownership. From 1949 to 1988, the average annual increase in road mileage in China was 6.7%, while the average annual increase in civilian vehicle ownership was 12.3%, with the growth rate of vehicle ownership being 0.84 times faster than the growth rate of road mileage. If no immediate measures are taken, the traffic problems caused by insufficient traffic capacity will become even more severe.

Second, for a long time, mixed traffic on roads has been a serious problem. On most roads in China, cars, agricultural tractors, and non-motorized vehicles travel together. The average proportion of slow-moving vehicles in mixed traffic is about 40%, while the proportion of cars is about 60%. This significantly reduces the number of cars that can pass and lowers the speed of cars.

Third, China has a high population density, with many pedestrians and slow-moving vehicles. There are many level crossings and road segments that pass through villages and towns, resulting in significant horizontal interference with vehicle operation on many roads, which also affects traffic capacity and speed. To alleviate the above-mentioned causes of backward traffic conditions, China needs an appropriate number of high-grade highways (high-speed roads and first and second-class highways). Effective measures must be taken to accelerate the construction of high-grade highways and gradually improve the technical conditions of third and fourth-class roads, so as to change China's backward road conditions as soon as possible.

### 要重视高等级公路

　　要重视高等级公路
　　交通部公路科学研究所研究员　张祖荫
    自建国以来，公路建设有了很大发展，但公路数量少，质量低，交通事故率高，不适应国民经济发展和提高人民生活水平的需要。造成这种状况的原因主要有三：
    一是长期没有采取有力措施，来缓解由于公路里程增长速度低于汽车保有量增长速度所造成的通行能力不足问题。从1949年到1988年，我国公路里程年平均递增6.7％，而民用汽车保有量年均递增达12.3％，汽车保有量增长速度比公路里程增长速度快0.84倍。如不立即采取措施，则由于通行能力不足造成的交通问题将更加严重。
    二是长期以来公路混合交通现象严重。我国绝大多数公路上汽车与农用拖拉机、非机动车等慢速车辆混合行驶，平均慢速车交通量约占混合交通量的40％，汽车交通量约占60％，相当程度减少了可通行的汽车交通量，并降低了汽车速度。
    三是我国人口密度大行人多，慢速车辆多，公路平交道口多，穿过村镇的路段较多，因而许多公路上对车辆运行的横向干扰大，对通行能力及车速也有不少影响。为缓解以上原因造成的交通落后状况，我国需要有相应数量的高等级公路（高速公路及一、二级汽车公路）。必须采取有力措施，加速高等级公路的建设，并逐步提高等外公路及低等级公路的技术条件，以便早日改变我国公路的落后状态。
