　　中国队技不如人宿愿未果
    南朝鲜阿联酋代表亚洲进军罗马
    据新华社新加坡10月28日电　（记者张千里、李永明）阿拉伯联合酋长国队今天傍晚在这里进行的1990年世界杯足球赛亚洲区预选赛决赛最后一轮比赛中，以1∶1逼和南朝鲜队，将与南朝鲜队一起代表亚洲参加明年在意大利举行的世界杯足球赛决赛阶段的比赛。
    南朝鲜队和阿联酋队的战绩分别为5战3胜2平积8分和5战1胜4平积6分，分列亚洲区预选赛第一、二名。
    中国队与卡塔尔队之战，中国队虽然在第76分钟时由10号马林在对方门前将球射入网内，先得一分。但卡队在第85分钟和第88分钟时，分别由12号马·劳苏和曼·穆菲塔赫各攻入一球，使得中国队只差一步之遥的出线机会化为泡影。
    在惹兰勿刹体育场进行的另外一场比赛中，自开赛以来未尝胜绩的沙特阿拉伯队在上、下半时各攻入一球，以2∶0击败朝鲜队。
    至此，亚洲区预选赛决赛全部结束，卡塔尔队1胜3平1负积5分名列第三；中国队2胜3负积4分居第四位，沙特阿拉伯队1胜2平2负同积4分，但因净胜球少列第五位；朝鲜队1胜1平3负积3分居第六位。
