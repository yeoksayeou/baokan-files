In rural Jin County, Hebei, over 1,300 Party member service areas have emerged, involving more than 17,000 Party members. Through these activities, Party members have served, managed, and educated the masses, bridging the gap between village committees and villagers, achieving notable results.

The Jin County Party Committee discovered through investigations that after implementing land contracts and dissolving production teams, the link between village committees and villagers was lost. Relying solely on a few village cadres was insufficient to manage the village effectively, which affected the Party's advantages and rural work to varying degrees. To address this, the county committee promoted the establishment of Party member service areas across the county.

Party member service areas are formed by Party members connecting with households and groups. They are based on Party small groups, with the original production teams as their regions, integrating organization, management, service, and education of the masses. They have the functions of self-management and education for Party members, and are responsible areas for leading villagers to complete various tasks, as well as work areas for solving production and living difficulties for the masses. In terms of management methods, they implement a target management responsibility system, conduct regular assessments and summaries, and assign various task indicators to each Party member, using this as an important basis for evaluating Party members. The activities of the service areas are led and arranged by the Party branch.

The establishment of Party member service areas in Jin County has strengthened the connection between Party branches and village committees with the masses, promoting the construction of both material and spiritual civilization in rural areas. During the summer grain procurement period this year, all service areas in the county launched the "Actively Sell Patriotic Grain, Support the Suppression of the Rebellion with Practical Actions" campaign, completing the summer grain procurement task ahead of schedule. Party member service areas have also solved many problems that individual households cannot solve. In Pang Village, a street lacked water pipes, and more than 60 Party members from various service areas voluntarily dug the pipe trenches, solving the drinking water problem for over 400 people. According to incomplete statistics, as of now, Party member service areas across the county have voluntarily repaired over 750 wells, repaired over 120 kilometers of field roads, and done over 150,000 good deeds for the people.

    晋县农村建立党员服务区  强化新时期党员服务意识
    本报石家庄电　在河北晋县农村，涌现出1300多个共产党员服务区，1.7万多名党员通过这一活动，服务、管理、教育群众，架设了村委会与村民联系的桥梁和纽带，收到显著效果。
    晋县县委通过调查发现，实行土地承包、取消生产队后，在村委会和村民之间失去了中间环节，单靠几个村干部很难管理好，致使党的优势的发挥和农村工作受到了不同程度的影响。为此，县委在全县范围推广了建立党员服务区这一做法。
    党员服务区是由党员联系户、党员联系组发展形成的。它以党小组为基础，以原来的生产队为区域，集组织、管理、服务、教育群众于一体。既有党员自我管理教育的职能，又是带领村民完成各项任务的责任区，为群众生产、生活排忧解难的工作区。在管理方法上，实行目标管理责任制，定期考核、总结，把各项任务指标落实到每个党员，并以此作为评议党员的重要依据。服务区的活动，由党支部统一领导和安排。
    晋县党员服务区的建立，使党支部和村委会加强了同群众之间的联系，推进了农村两个文明建设。在今年夏粮征购期间，全县各服务区开展“踊跃交售爱国粮，以实际行动支持平暴”的活动，提前完成了夏粮征购任务。党员服务区还解决了不少一家一户难以解决的问题。庞村有条街道没安自来水管道，各服务区60多名党员义务挖好管道沟，解决了400多人吃水难问题。据不完全统计，到目前，全县党员服务区为村民义务维修机井750余眼，整修田间道路120多公里，为群众做好事15万件次。
