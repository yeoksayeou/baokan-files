The first gallium arsenide 120-gate array integrated circuit and gallium arsenide high-speed frequency divider circuit in China have been successfully developed in Shanghai.

These two types of integrated circuits, compared to the widely used silicon integrated circuits, have advantages such as high speed, low power consumption, high temperature resistance, and radiation resistance. They can be applied in supercomputers, large-capacity fiber optics and microwave communications, aerospace technology, and other fields.

Gallium arsenide super high-speed integrated circuits are a highly competitive research project internationally. Countries like the United States and Japan have invested heavily in this area and have already produced products. China has listed this super high-speed integrated circuit as a key project for the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," with the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy taking the lead. The main technical indicators have reached the international level of the early 1980s.

　　上海制成超高速集成电路
    据新华社上海10月29日电　（记者张学全）国内第一块砷化镓120门门阵列集成电路和砷化镓高速分频器电路，在上海研制成功。
    这两种集成电路与目前广泛应用的硅集成电路相比，有着速度快、功耗低、耐高温、抗辐照等优点，可应用于超级计算机、大容量光纤和微波通讯、航天技术等领域。
    砷化镓超高速集成电路是国际上竞争激烈的研究项目。美国、日本等一些工业发达国家对此大量投资，现已推出产品。我国将这种超高速集成电路列为“七五”攻关项目，由上海冶金研究所攻关。其主要技术指标达到国际80年代初的水平。
