	Various regions are prioritizing the investigation of counterfeit and substandard goods. The nationwide product quality sampling work in 30 cities has been completed. Relevant departments will take legal action against those who manufacture and sell counterfeit and substandard goods.

	New China News Agency, Beijing, October 9th — (Central People's Radio Station reporter Wang Lianxi, New China News Agency reporter Jiang Zhaizhong) In accordance with the State Council's "Notice on Severely Cracking Down on the Mixing of Fake Goods in Commercial Products" and the General Office of the State Council's forwarding of the "Opinions of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision on Severely Punishing Those Responsible for Selling Counterfeit and Substandard Goods," government departments and technical supervision departments across the country are currently arranging for a thorough quality inspection of goods in the market.

	In recent years, with the development of industry and market demand, some enterprises and dealers, driven by greed, have disregarded the nation's laws and the interests of the people, producing and selling counterfeit and substandard goods. This has disrupted the market and caused irreparable damage to the nation's construction and the people's lives and property. To prevent counterfeit and substandard goods from continuing to harm consumers, local government departments, in accordance with the requirements of the 13th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to "effectively handle several matters of general concern to the people," have placed great importance on this product inspection work. Vice Governor Wen Shizhen of Liaoning Province pointed out in a telephone conference on conducting a thorough inspection of counterfeit and substandard goods that the proliferation of counterfeit and substandard goods is not only an economic issue but also a political one. Economically, it causes losses to the people and the nation, and politically, it damages the credibility of the Party and the government. Therefore, it must be severely cracked down upon. The government of Jilin Province recently also issued a notice to the entire province, requiring a thorough investigation of some product quality issues that have been strongly reflected by the masses. Provinces and cities such as Shandong, Heilongjiang, Chengdu, and Chongqing have also launched investigations into counterfeit and substandard goods.

	During the inspections, various regions have discovered many problems. For example, in Zhangmaoshu, Zhang Xiaoduan, and Zhang Baocheng's jointly operated Limin Flour Mill in Zhangcheng County, Hebei Province, 4 tons of talc powder were mixed into 40 tons of flour for sale, and this was discovered by the local technical supervision department. The technical supervision department of Chengdu City uncovered two black-market operations selling low-voltage electrical appliances from market clues, with a value of over 2 million yuan.

	To implement the spirit of the notice, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision began conducting a large-scale product quality inspection in 30 cities nationwide starting from early September. It is reported that the sampling work has been completed, and various indicators are currently being verified. Relevant departments will impose fines and other legal penalties on those who manufacture and sell counterfeit and substandard goods, in accordance with the law and relevant regulations.

    各地重视清查假冒伪劣商品
    全国30个城市商品质量抽样工作已经结束
    有关部门将依法惩处制造销售伪劣商品者
    新华社北京10月9日电　（中央人民广播电台记者王连西、新华社记者姜在忠）根据国务院《关于严厉打击在商品中掺杂使假的通知》和国务院办公厅转发的《国家技术监督局关于严厉惩处经销伪劣商品责任者意见的通知》精神，全国各地的政府部门和技术监督部门正布置对市场上的商品进行一次彻底的质量清查。
    近几年来，随着工业发展和市场的需求，一些企业和经销者见利忘义，置国家的法律和人民的利益于不顾，生产、经销一些假冒、伪劣商品，从而扰乱了市场，给国家建设和人民生命财产造成不可弥补的损失，为杜绝假冒、伪劣商品继续坑害消费者，各地政府部门遵照党的十三届四中全会提出的“切实做好几件人民普遍关心的事情”的要求，各地十分重视这次商品检查工作。辽宁省副省长闻世震在布置对假冒、伪劣商品进行大检查的电话会议上指出，假冒、伪劣商品的泛滥，不仅是一个经济问题，同时也是一个政治问题。经济上给人民和国家造成损失，政治上败坏了党和政府的威信，因此必须严厉打击。吉林省政府最近也通电全省，要求对群众反映强烈的一些商品质量问题，进行一次彻底清查。山东、黑龙江、成都、重庆等省市，也都开展了对伪劣商品的查处。
    各地在检查中已发现了不少问题。如河北省藁城县张麦熟、张小端、张宝成三人合办的利民面粉厂，将4吨滑石粉掺入40吨面粉中销售，被当地技术监督部门查获。成都市技术监督部门从市场发现的线索中，先后挖出两个销售低压电器的黑窝，价值达200多万元。
    国家技术监督局为贯彻通知精神，从9月初开始，在全国30个城市进行了商品质量大检查。据悉，目前抽样工作已经结束，正在进行各项指标的验定。有关部门依据法律和有关规定，将对制造、销售假冒、伪劣商品者施以罚款，直至法律的制裁。
