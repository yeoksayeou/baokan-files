Newspapers in Zaire, Syria, and Nepal have published articles praising China's reform and opening-up policy on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	Recently, the Zairian newspaper *Labour* published two articles by Kusangumana, a reporter from the Zairian Journalists Association's Lower Zaire branch, who had just visited China. The articles, published on September 19 and 20, praised China's reform and opening-up policy.

	The articles stated: "The China we visited is a country full of ambition, determined to take giant strides to narrow the technological gap." The articles pointed out that because the Chinese people believe they have fallen behind in certain areas and want to build a highly modernized socialist society, they have concluded that they must end the long-standing policy of isolation and adopt a policy of reform and opening up.

	The articles believed that over the past decade, this policy has achieved overall success. The articles pointed out that Chinese leaders believe that reform and opening up can only achieve the expected goals if they adhere to the four cardinal principles of upholding the leadership of the Communist Party, adhering to Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, and adhering to the socialist road, and proceed in a planned, step-by-step, and gradual manner.

	The official newspaper of Syria's ruling party, *Al-Ba'ath*, published an article on September 28 praising the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China in building socialism over the past 40 years.

	The article stated that especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1978, the achievements of the Chinese people have been particularly impressive.

	The article stated that due to the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, China has revitalized its domestic economy and strengthened its economic power.

	The article also criticized a small number of people who used the turmoil in Beijing this summer to plan a premeditated and organized counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The article stated that due to the effective measures taken by the Chinese government, Beijing has now returned to normal, and the entire country has stabilized.

	The Nepali weekly *Matribhumi* recently published an editorial praising China as a "reliable friend."

	The editorial stated: "China has always opposed foreign control and aggression, opposed imperialism, and supported the just demands of all countries, large and small, to gain the right to exist and equality."

	The editorial further stated that China has become a great power and hopes that other countries will progress together with it, without intending to bring other countries into its sphere of influence.

	The editorial pointed out that as a member of the United Nations Security Council, China has always upheld justice, opposed racial discrimination, colonialism, and hegemony, and provided cooperation to solve the economic difficulties of Third World countries.

	In discussing China's achievements in construction, the editorial stated that China has entered the space age in just 40 years and has made commendable achievements in improving the living standards of its people, which is admirable.

    扎伊尔叙利亚尼泊尔报刊载文
    赞扬我国改革开放政策
    本报综合新华社消息　在中华人民共和国成立40周年的时候，扎伊尔、叙利亚、尼泊尔报刊发表文章，赞扬新中国取得的成就。
    不久前访华的扎伊尔《劳动报》记者、扎伊尔记者协会下扎伊尔省分会主席库桑古姆纳9月19日和20日连续在《劳动报》上发表文章，赞扬中国的改革开放政策。
    文章说：“我们访问过的中国是一个雄心勃勃的国家，它决定迈出巨大的步伐，缩小技术方面落后的差距。”文章指出，由于中国人民认为自己在某些方面落后了，并要建立一个十分强大和高度现代化的社会主义社会，所以他们得出结论：必须结束长期闭关锁国的政策，并以一项改革和对外开放的政策取而代之。
    文章认为，十年来，这项政策在总体上已取得了成绩。文章指出，中国领导人坚信，改革开放只有坚持共产党的领导、坚持毛泽东思想、坚持人民民主专政和坚持社会主义道路这四项基本原则，有计划、分步骤和逐步的进行，才能取得预期的目标。
    叙利亚执政党机关报《复兴报》9月28日发表文章，赞扬中国人民四十年来在中国共产党的领导下在建设社会主义中所取得的伟大成就。
    文章说，特别是1978年中国共产党第十一届三中全会召开以来，中国人民取得的成就给人的印象尤为深刻。
    文章说，由于推行了改革和开放的政策，中国重新活跃了国内经济，加强了经济实力。
    文章还指责极少数人利用今夏发生在北京的学潮，策划了一场有预谋、有组织的企图推翻中国共产党领导的反革命暴乱。由于中国政府采取了得力措施，现在北京已恢复平静，整个中国也已稳定下来。
    尼泊尔《祖国》周刊最近发表社论，赞扬中国是一个“信得过的朋友”。
    社论说：“中国始终反对外国控制和侵略，反对帝国主义，支持不论大小的所有国家为获得生存与平等权利的正义要求。”
    社论又说，中国已成为一个大强国，它希望别国同它一道进步，而无意让别国进入其势力范围之内。
    社论指出，中国作为联合国安理会成员，始终伸张正义，反对种族隔离、殖民主义和霸权主义，为解决第三世界国家的经济困难提供合作。
    在谈到中国的建设成就时，社论说，中国在40年的短时间内已进入太空时代，在提高人民生活水平方面取得了可喜的成就，令人钦佩。
