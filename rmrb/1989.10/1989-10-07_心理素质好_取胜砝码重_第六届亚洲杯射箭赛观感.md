The balance of victory and defeat in archery competitions is increasingly influenced by psychological factors. Over the past three days, many athletes participating in the 6th Asian Cup Archery Competition have tasted the sweetness of psychological training, and their performances have improved rapidly.

The Chinese Taipei team, in the preliminary rounds, saw both their men's and women's teams leap into second place. One of the reasons for this success is their emphasis on psychological training. According to team leader Lin Zhaoxiang, they have hired a South Korean coach who insists on relaxation exercises, including folding paper and relaxation drills. This helps the athletes stay calm and focused during competitions. Team members Qiu Bingkun and Lai Fangmei have stable psychological states and are not easily disturbed by the environment, often shooting 10-ring scores. They attribute their success to psychological training. It is noted that the Chinese Taipei team performs a type of qigong-like exercise before and after the competition, crossing their hands forward and backward while coordinating their breathing.

Chinese coach Qin Pingcun, who once trained world-renowned archer Li Lingjuan, said that coaches should not only be technical experts but also "artists" and "orchestra conductors," cultivating athletes' good psychological qualities. A typical archery athlete usually needs five years of training to achieve results, but Li Lingjuan only trained for two years and emerged as a national champion. The secret lies in psychological training. He likened it to making tofu from soy milk; the key step is adding coagulant. Athletes becoming champions is similar; it depends on whether the coach knows how to add the coagulant. Those who only know technical training but do not understand psychological training cannot turn "soy milk" into nutritious "tofu."

In this competition, some athletes have also tasted the bitterness of not undergoing psychological training. They performed well in regular training, but on the competition field, they felt nervous and couldn't calm down, resulting in poor performances.

Many archery teams are developing a systematic approach to psychological training, elevating their understanding from a sensory level to a theoretical one, such as pre- and post-competition relaxation and using the principles of Zen to stabilize emotions. Strengthening psychological training will undoubtedly promote the reform of training methods, thereby raising the level of Asian archery to new heights.

    心理素质好　取胜砝码重
    ——第六届亚洲杯射箭赛观感
    射箭赛胜负的天平上，心理因素的砝码在加重。3天来，参加第6届亚洲杯射箭赛的许多选手已尝到心理训练的甜头，成绩上升很快。
    中国台北队在预赛中，男女两支队伍双双跃入第2名，其中一个原因就是重视心理练习。据领队林兆祥介绍，他们聘请的南朝鲜教练，平时坚持做放松练习，包括做叠纸动作和放松操，这样，队员心里不紧张，比赛精力集中。该队男选手邱炳坤、女选手赖芳美心理比较稳定，不受环境干扰，射出不少10环，他们也是得益于心理训练。人们注意到，中国台北队在赛前和赛后要做一种类似气功的操，两手交叉，或向前向后，并配合呼吸。
    曾培养世界名将李玲娟的中国教练秦平村说，教练员不能只会教技术，做一个技术员，还应该是“艺术家”、“乐队指挥”，培养运动员有良好的心理素质。一个射箭运动员一般要经过5年训练才能出成绩，而李玲娟只训练2年就崭露头角，成为全国冠军，其奥妙就是在心理上作文章。他比喻说，豆浆变成豆腐，关键的一手是点卤，运动员成为冠军和它很相似，就看你教练会不会点卤。那些只会教技术不懂得心理训练的人，是不能将“豆浆”变成营养丰富的“豆腐”的。
    这次比赛，也有一些选手尝到不进行心理训练的苦果。他们平时训练成绩不错，可上了赛场，心里打鼓，难以平静，结果比赛砸了锅。
    不少射箭队心理训练正在形成一套系统的方法，从过去感性的认识上升到理论的高度，如赛前、赛后的放松，用“禅”的道理使情绪稳定等等。心理训练的加强无疑会促使训练方法的改革，从而把亚洲射箭水平提到一个新高度。
