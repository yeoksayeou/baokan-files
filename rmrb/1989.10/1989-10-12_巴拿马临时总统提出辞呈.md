Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from Mexico City, October 11th: Panama's acting President Rodriguez submitted his resignation to the Supreme National Council of Panama on the night of the 10th. However, the Council requested that Rodriguez remain in office until a suitable replacement is found.

According to reports from Mexico City, Rodriguez submitted his resignation due to his disagreement with General Noriega's implementation of a "wartime policy" within the country. Panama's Foreign Minister Jorge Ritt also resigned for the same reason. There are reports that Leonardo Kam, Panama's ambassador to the United Nations, will replace Ritt as the new foreign minister.

Following the failed coup in Panama on October 3rd, General Noriega believed that "the United States has intensified its aggression against Panama" and that "democracy is ineffective in the face of war." Consequently, while purging the military, he demanded the implementation of "wartime laws" in political and economic policies. On the 10th, he once again instructed the tightening of economic budgets for national institution personnel. Rodriguez believed that these policies would harm the "government's foundation," leading to his resignation.

    巴拿马临时总统提出辞呈
    本报墨西哥城10月11日电  记者郭伟成报道：巴拿马临时总统罗德里格斯10日夜间向巴拿马最高国务委员会提出辞呈。但是，国务委员会要求罗德里格斯等到有合适人选接替时再正式辞去临时总统职务。
    据墨西哥城新闻媒介报道说，罗德里格斯是因为不同意诺列加将军对国内实行“战时政策”而提出辞呈的。巴拿马外长豪尔赫·里特也由于同样原因提出辞职。有消息说，巴拿马驻联合国大使莱奥纳多·卡姆将替代里特出任外长。
    巴拿马10月3日未遂政变以后，诺列加将军认为“美国加剧了对巴拿马的侵略”，“面对战争状态，民主无济于事”。因而，在对军队进行清洗的同时，要求在政治经济政策方面也实施“战争法”，并于昨天（10日）午间再次指示对国家机构人员实行经济预算紧缩措施。罗德里格斯认为上述政策将损害“政府的执政基础”，因而提出辞呈。
