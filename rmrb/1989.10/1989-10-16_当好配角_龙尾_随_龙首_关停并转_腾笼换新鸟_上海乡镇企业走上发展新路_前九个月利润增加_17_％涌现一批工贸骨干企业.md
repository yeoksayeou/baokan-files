Shanghai's township enterprises have embarked on a path of healthy development during the rectification process. The practice over the past year has shown that although the adjustment has eliminated a small number of unqualified or enterprises that cannot get out of difficulties, it has brought new vitality to the township enterprises as a whole.

Through the adjustment, Shanghai's suburban township enterprises have first clarified the guiding ideology of running enterprises, which is to serve large industries and play a supporting role. In a figurative sense, it is to let the "dragon tail" follow the "dragon head," to take the path of urban-rural integration, and at the same time to fully utilize the advantages of labor-intensive and traditional crafts in the suburbs, building an export-earning base with suburban characteristics.

By being content with a supporting role and actively earning foreign exchange, this clear guiding ideology has brought the first batch of results after the adjustment. From January to September this year, the profits of Shanghai's township enterprises increased by 17% compared to the same period last year, and the foreign exchange earnings from exports also increased by 40%, with a number of industrial and commercial backbone enterprises emerging.

The "dragon tail" follows the "dragon head." After the adjustment, township enterprises are now doing everything possible to respond to urban large-scale industries. Some are joint ventures with large industries, while others become a branch of a large factory. They determine their own adjustment plans based on the content and steps of the adjustment of large industries. Jinshan County, adjacent to the Shanghai Petrochemical Complex, has its product adjustments in line with the Petrochemical Complex. After a comprehensive analysis, they listed 50 key products, investing limited funds into key enterprises and key products, while closing down a number of low-profit enterprises and halting a number of projects.

During the adjustment process, 600 of the 12,000 township enterprises in the suburbs of Shanghai have been closed or restructured, accounting for 5%. This is not a passive or harmful move for township enterprises. They call this "emptying the cage to bring in new birds." In other words, it means stopping the production of old products and using these enterprises' factories, equipment, and manpower for new combinations. Some are merged into high-profit enterprises, while others are joint ventures with urban enterprises, changing the product structure. This way, on the one hand, it provides a way out for some enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy, and the employment of workers is not affected; on the other hand, it also expands the production scale of high-profit enterprises. Since the fourth quarter of last year, Baoshan County's Wusong Township has already had 8 enterprises find their way out of difficulties using the "emptying the cage to bring in new birds" method.

Now, it is generally not possible for township enterprises to expand "externally," so they have shifted their focus from external expansion to internal rectification and improvement.

First, they rely on the technological strength of large cities, strengthen cooperation with various research institutions in the city, and introduce new products and technologies developed by research institutions, which is called "climbing the ladder." Chuansha County's Jiang Town, with the assistance of relevant research institutions, has developed 10 new products, including pipe cutting machines and multifunctional emergency power sources. Some of these new products fill gaps in the city, some are included in the city's "Spark Program," and some have expanded exports.

Adjusting the structure, improving efficiency, and promoting enterprises to focus on improving internal management and raising quality have become the agenda. The Municipal Agricultural Commission recently held a meeting to exchange experiences in strengthening enterprise management, clearly proposing to shift from emphasizing investment and expanding "externally" to focusing on "internal" management. The ten suburban counties generally strengthened the leadership of enterprise management, established specialized institutions one after another, and the towns also correspondingly strengthened the management forces. They also listed the good or bad management of enterprises as an indicator for the assessment of cadres, linking it with the material rewards of cadres. A trend of seeking efficiency from management and verifying management with efficiency is emerging in the suburbs of Shanghai.

Currently, Shanghai's township enterprises still face many new difficulties. But a year of practice has proven that a successful township enterprise must always face storms and grow in storms. Undoubtedly, the adjustment and rectification will push township enterprises to a new historical stage.

    当好配角“龙尾”随“龙首”　关停并转“腾笼换新鸟”
    上海乡镇企业走上发展新路
    前九个月利润增加17％涌现一批工贸骨干企业
    本报上海电　上海郊区乡镇企业在治理整顿中走上健康发展之路。一年来的实践证明，调整尽管淘汰了少数不合格的或无法摆脱困境的企业，但使乡镇企业从整体上焕发了新的生机。
    通过调整，上海郊区乡镇企业首先把办企业的指导思想搞清楚了，那就是为大工业服务，当好配角。形象的说法就是“龙尾”随“龙首”，走城乡一体化道路，同时充分发挥郊区劳力密集、传统工艺的优势，建成具有郊区特色的出口创汇基地。
    甘当配角，积极创汇，这个明确的指导思想换来了调整后第一批成果。今年1到9月份，上海的乡镇企业利润比去年同期增长17％，出口创汇收购额也比去年同期增长40％，涌现了一大批工贸结合的骨干企业。
    龙尾随龙首。经过调整，如今乡镇企业千方百计同城市大工业相呼应，有的同大工业搞联营，有的成为大厂的一个分厂。他们根据大工业的调整内容和步伐，确定自己的调整方案。金山县紧靠上海石化总厂，他们的产品调整同石化总厂相呼应，经过全面分析，列出50个重点产品，把有限的资金投入重点企业和重点产品，同时并转一批效益不高的企业，停建一批项目。
    在调整过程中，上海郊区12000个乡村企业，有600多个关停并转，占5％。这对乡镇企业来说，并非是消极的，有害的。他们把这称为“腾笼换新鸟”。换句话说，就是停止生产旧产品，利用这些企业的厂房、设备、人力进行新的组合，一部分并入效益高的企业，一部分同城市企业搞联营，改变产品结构。这样做，一方面使部分濒临倒闭的企业找到了出路，职工的就业不受影响；另一方面，也使效益高的企业扩大了生产规模。宝山县吴淞乡自去年第四季度以来，先后已有8家企业采取“腾笼换新鸟”的办法走出了困境。
    现在，乡镇企业想扩大“外延”一般不可能了，于是把目光从外部转向内部整顿和提高上来。
    首先是依托大城市的科技力量，加强同城市各科研部门的合作，把科研部门开发的新产品新技术转让过来，这叫做“借梯上楼”。川沙县江镇乡在有关科研部门协助下，先后开发了管子切割机、多功能应急电源等10个新产品。这些新产品有的填补了市内空白，有的被列入市“星火计划”，有的扩大了出口。
    调整结构，提高效益，促进企业把改善内部管理，把提高素质的问题提到日程上来。市农委最近召开了加强企业管理经验交流会，明确地提出要把过去重投资，扩大“外延”转向注重“内涵”管理上来。郊区十个县普遍加强对企业管理的领导，先后成立了专门机构，各乡也相应充实了管理力量，并把企业管理好坏列入干部考核指标，同干部的物质报酬挂钩。上海郊区正在出现一个向管理要效益、用效益检验管理的热潮。
    目前，上海市乡镇企业仍面临许多新的困难。但一年的实践证明，一个成功的乡镇企业，总要经受风浪，在风浪中成长。毫无疑问，调整治理，必将把乡镇企业推向历史的新阶段。
