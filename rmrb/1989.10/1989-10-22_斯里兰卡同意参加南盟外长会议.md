Sri Lanka has agreed to participate in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) foreign ministers' meeting. According to a report from the New China News Agency in Islamabad, the SAARC foreign ministers' meeting will be held on November 8 in Islamabad. Sri Lanka has agreed to attend this meeting.

The SAARC foreign ministers' meeting was originally scheduled to be held from July 1 to 2 in Islamabad, but it was postponed due to Sri Lanka's boycott in protest of another member state, India, refusing to withdraw its troops from Sri Lanka.

A Pakistani official stated that this SAARC foreign ministers' meeting will discuss issues of common interest among member states and determine the venue and date for the next SAARC summit. The fifth summit was originally scheduled to be held this November in Colombo.
