The research project on "High-Yield Hybrid Rice Seed Production Technology," led by renowned Chinese seed production expert and senior agronomist Liu Wenbing, has made significant breakthroughs. The average yield of 371 mu of hybrid rice seed fields reached 308 kilograms per mu, with the highest yield reaching 409.6 kilograms per mu, setting a new record for hybrid rice seed production in China.

Traditionally, hybrid rice seed production required the method of leaf cutting and husk removal. The new high-yield seed production technology, however, utilizes the rapid-acting effects of a plant growth regulator called "Speed-Effective Flowering Promoter" to achieve seed production without the need for leaf cutting or husk removal.

The advent of this new technology opens up new avenues for mechanized seed production in hybrid rice, holding great significance for the development of hybrid rice in China.

    杂交稻制种有新突破
    新华社福州10月8日电（记者蔡清河）由我国著名的制种专家、高级农艺师刘文炳主持研究的“杂交水稻超高产制种技术研究”课题，取得了突破性进展。371亩籼稻制种田平均亩产达308公斤，最高单产409.6公斤，创我国籼稻制种单产之冠。
    杂交稻制种过去需要采用剖叶剥苞的方法。新的高产制种新技术则借助速效调花灵的威力，达到不割叶不剥苞也能制种。
    这一新技术的问世，为杂交稻制种开拓了机械化制种的新途径，对发展我国杂交水稻具有重大意义。
