	People's Daily, Beijing, October 5th - Correspondent Wen Xian reports: Chairman of the Central Military Commission Deng Xiaoping praised the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for adopting pragmatic and flexible policies in recent years this morning. He said, "This approach is beneficial for uniting the internal forces, winning over friends, and isolating enemies."

	He also emphasized, "As long as the policies and strategies are correct, ultimate victory will be achieved."

	Deng Xiaoping made these remarks during a meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at the Great Hall of the People.

	Deng Xiaoping told Arafat, "We are happy with every victory you achieve. You have already achieved significant victories, though not complete ones. Regardless, we support you."

	Arafat said, "Chairman Mao once said that the road is tortuous, but the future is bright. Our situation is exactly like that."

	Deng Xiaoping continued, "Indeed, it is. I hope you will be even more united."

	Arafat expressed, "We are united internally. This has been the source of our struggle for many years. We are very happy to hear your opinions. These opinions are very valuable to us."

	At the beginning of the meeting, Deng Xiaoping praised the friendship between China and Palestine. He said, "We have maintained a relationship of mutual trust and support for decades. Our relationship is not ordinary." Arafat replied, "Yes, I will never forget when I and the late Abu Jihad first came to China to inform our Chinese friends that we would begin our revolutionary struggle."

	Deng Xiaoping added, "Your struggle for national sovereignty and independence has lasted nearly 40 years, similar to the time since the founding of the People's Republic of China. We should say that we have a friendship that has lasted 40 years. In another 40 years, we will have an 80-year friendship. Our friendship will last forever."

	Arafat nodded repeatedly, "We will never forget the friendly feelings the Chinese people have always had for the Palestinian people."

	As the 20-minute meeting was about to conclude, Deng Xiaoping told his guest, "You will soon meet with Premier Li Peng for talks and later with General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Now, they are in charge. You can discuss some matters with them. We are old friends, just meeting."

	Arafat said, "This meeting is very important. Your meeting and opinions have strengthened us and boosted our morale."

    会见阿拉法特总统时
    邓小平赞扬巴解务实灵活政策
    宾主一致肯定中巴之间几十年如一日的友谊
    本报北京10月5日讯　记者温宪报道：中共中央军委主席邓小平今天赞扬巴解组织近年来采取了务实、灵活的政策。他说，这样做有利于团结内部、争取朋友、孤立敌人。
    他同时强调说，只要政策、策略正确，最终总能取得胜利。
    邓小平是上午在人民大会堂会见巴勒斯坦国总统阿拉法特时发表上述意见的。
    邓小平告诉阿拉法特，你们取得的每一个胜利我们都高兴。你们已经取得了相当大的胜利，当然不是全部胜利，但不管怎么样，我们都是支持你们的。
    阿拉法特说，毛主席当年曾经说过，道路是曲折的，前途是光明的，我们的情况就是这样。
    邓小平接着说，确实是这样。希望你们更加团结一致。
    阿拉法特表示，我们内部是团结的。这是我们多年来坚持斗争的源泉。我们很高兴听到了您的意见。这些意见对我们来说都是很宝贵的。
    会见开始时，邓小平盛赞了中、巴友谊。他说：“我们是几十年如一日，相互信任、相互支持的典范。我们的关系不是一般的关系。”阿拉法特答道：“是这样。我忘不了我与已故的阿布·杰哈德第一次来到中国访问以便告诉中国朋友我们将开始革命斗争的情景。”
    邓小平接着说：“你们争取国家主权、民族独立的斗争将近40年，与中华人民共和国建国时间相当。应该说我们是40年如一日的友谊。再过40年，我们就是80年如一日的友谊。我们的友谊万古长青。”
    阿拉法特连连点头：“我们忘不了中国人民在任何时候都对巴勒斯坦人民所怀的友好感情。”
    20分钟的会见就要结束了，邓小平对客人说，你马上要跟李鹏总理会谈，下午还要同江泽民总书记会见。现在是他们管事了，有些事情你可以跟他们谈。我们是老朋友，见见面。
    阿拉法特说，这次见面很重要。您的会见和意见增加了我们的力量，鼓舞了我们的士气。
