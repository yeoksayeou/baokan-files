The UN General Assembly today discussed the topic of "Science and Technology for Development." Our representative called for strengthening international scientific and technological cooperation and exchange to promote economic development in all countries, especially developing countries, and hoped that the United Nations would play a greater role in this regard.

The General Assembly today reviewed the "Science and Technology for Development" agenda and celebrated the 10th anniversary of the implementation of the important concept proposed in the "Vienna Programme of Action."

Ding Yuanhong said that over the past 10 years, although developing countries have made great efforts to promote development through science and technology, the results have fallen far short of expectations. One of the main reasons is that some developed countries have not fulfilled their initial commitments, resulting in a shortage of scientific and technological funds and the ineffective execution of the tasks and goals set out in the "Vienna Programme of Action."

Ding Yuanhong proposed suggestions to further strengthen the role of the United Nations' scientific and technological organization, the "Intergovernmental Committee for Science and Technology for Development."

Ding Yuanhong also supported the continuation of the "Science and Technology for Development Fund" as an entity and expressed that the Chinese government would continue to provide financial support within its capabilities.

Our reporter Liu Kai Chen reported from the United Nations on October 26: The 44th session of the UN General Assembly today unanimously adopted five resolutions on "Science and Technology for Development," calling on the United Nations system to vigorously help developing countries improve their scientific and technological levels and promote economic development.

The resolution titled "Building National Scientific and Technological Capabilities" calls on the various organizations of the United Nations system to help developing countries build their national scientific and technological capabilities according to their development goals, priorities, and plans, and promote economic growth in these countries.

The resolution titled "Funding for Science and Technology for Development" emphasizes that the "Science and Technology for Development Fund" should be maintained and that sufficient resources should be provided on a continuous and guaranteed basis to support the scientific and technological development of developing countries.

The other three resolutions are "Implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action Over the Past 10 Years," "Coordination and Unification of Activities in the Field of Science and Technology," and "Technological Assessment."

    本报联合国10月26日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国代表丁原洪大使今天在第44届联合国大会上呼吁加强国际科技合作与交流，以促进各国、特别是发展中国家的经济发展，并希望联合国在这方面发挥更大作用。
    联大今天审议“科学技术促进发展”议题，并庆祝提出这一重要概念的《维也纳行动纲领》执行10周年。
    丁原洪说，过去10年，虽然发展中国家为科技促进发展尽了很大努力，但结果与人们的期望相差甚远。一个主要原因是部分发达国家没有履行当初承担的义务，致使科技资金短缺而未有效地执行《维也纳行动纲领》规定的任务和目标。
    丁原洪提出了进一步加强联合国的科技机构“科技促进发展政府间委员会”的作用的建议。
    丁原洪还支持“科技促进发展基金”作为一个实体继续存在，并表示中国政府将继续对它提供力所能及的财力支持。
    本报联合国10月26日电  记者刘开宸报道：第44届联大今天一致通过关于“科学技术促进发展”的5项决议，呼吁联合国系统大力帮助发展中国家提高科技水平，促进经济发展。
    题为《建立本国科技能力》的决议，呼吁联合国系统各组织，按照发展中国家的发展目标、优先次序和计划，帮助它们建立本国科技能力，促进这些国家的经济增长。
    题为《科学和技术促进发展资金的筹措》的决议，强调
  “科学和技术促进发展基金”应予保持，在持续不断和有保证的基础上向发展中国家提供充分资源，以支持它们的科技发展。
    其它3项决议为《维也纳行动纲领10年来执行情况》、《协调和统一科技领域的活动》和《技术评估》。
