Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 6th.

A batch of cutting-edge modern technologies is quietly and rapidly infiltrating the traditional industries of Shanghai, an old industrial base. Over the past four years, more than 200 new technological achievements have been promoted in the industrial system, leading to revolutionary changes in some traditional processes and production methods.

In 1986, Shanghai selected seven key areas for development: computer, microelectronics, biotechnology, fiber optics communication, new materials, laser technology, and robotics. The city has been dedicated to expanding the application scope of these new technologies and promoting their industrialization.

The earliest developed and applied technologies, computers and microelectronics, are now ubiquitous in Shanghai's machinery, textiles, metallurgy, chemical, and numerous other industries, as well as in production control, product design, and comprehensive management. The city now has more than 3,500 various types of machine tools equipped with computer numerical control (CNC) or numerical control (NC) devices. Additionally, boilers, rubber vulcanizing tanks, textile dyeing vats, and electroplating production lines, among other equipment, have undergone similar automated transformations.

Robots, once considered high-tech and primarily seen in exhibition halls, are now being put to practical use according to their specific capabilities. At Shanghai Bicycle Factory No. 4, 10 skilled domestically produced mechanical arms are gradually replacing workers in welding bicycle frames. The frames welded by these robots have smooth, full seams, significantly narrowing the gap between domestic and foreign products in terms of craftsmanship. Soon, the Shanghai No. 1 robot will take the lead in welding the chassis of Santana sedans; spray-painting robots and high-rise building cleaning robots will also soon enter their respective positions.

Lasers, once known only from educational films, are now tools in the hands of many watchmakers and artisans. They use these tools to drill, weld, and cut, making centuries-old manual labor easier and faster. Shanghai has also established a laser processing application service center dedicated to industrial services, with an annual output value of 20 million yuan.

The promotion and application of new technologies are transforming Shanghai's traditional industries. Meanwhile, new industries are also developing through Shanghai's strong industrial support capabilities. Currently, the city has established more than 30 new technology pilot bases. The computer industry has formed an annual production capacity of 10,000 microcomputers and 100 medium and small-sized computers. Fiber optics communication has established the nation's only concentrated production base with an annual output of 20,000 kilometers. The microelectronics industry has also formed three integrated circuit production and development bases of initial scale.

    上海改造传统工业  新兴技术悄悄渗透
    数十个行业工艺和生产方式发生革命性变化
    据新华社上海10月6日电　（记者陈雅妮）一批处于科学技术最前沿的现代新兴技术，正悄悄地、迅速地向上海这个老工业基地的传统产业渗透。近4年已有200多项新技术成果在工业系统推广，使一些传统工艺和生产方式发生着革命性变化。
    1986年，上海市选择计算机、微电子、生物工程技术、光纤通信、新型材料、激光技术、机器人等7项新兴技术作为重点开发领域，并致力于扩大新技术的应用范围，推动新技术自身的产业化。
    最早开发应用的计算机和微电子技术，目前在上海机电、纺织、冶金、化工等数十个行业及生产控制、产品设计、综合管理等诸多领域几乎无所不在。全市已有3500多台各类机床装上了计算机数显装置或数控装置。同时获得这种自动化改造的还有锅炉、橡胶硫化罐、纺织染纱缸、电镀生产线等10大类设备。
    被视为高精尖的机器人不再只是展览大厅的宠儿，它们正根据自己的特长和能力各就各位。在上海自行车四厂，10只娴熟的国产机械手，将逐步代替车架焊接工人的劳动。它们焊接的自行车车架，焊缝光滑饱满，大大缩短了国产自行车与国外产品的工艺差距。不久以后，上海1号机器人将成为桑塔纳轿车底盘焊接的主角；喷涂机器人、高层建筑清扫机器人也将陆续进入各自的岗位。
    人们从科教电影中认识的激光，现在成为许多钟表和工艺美术工人手中的工具。他们用这种工具打孔、焊接、切割，许多沿用数百年的手工劳动变得轻松快捷。上海还出现一家专为工业服务的激光加工应用服务中心，年产值达2000万元。
    新兴技术的推广应用，改造着上海的传统工业；同时新兴产业也凭借着上海强大的产业配套能力发展了自己。目前，全市已建成30多个新技术中试基地。计算机行业已形成年产1万台微型机和100台中小型机的生产能力，光纤通信形成全国唯一集中的、年产2万公里的产业基地、微电子工业也形成初具规模的3个集成电路生产开发基地。
