A batch of leading cadres' cases of law and discipline violations are handled

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th - Today, the Minister of the Supervision Department, Yu Jianrong, said here that since this year, various levels of supervision departments have prioritized the fight against corruption and the handling of cases of law and discipline violations, focusing their efforts on investigating a batch of cases involving embezzlement, bribery, using power for personal gain, "official profiteering," and extravagant waste. The handling of a batch of leading cadres' cases of law and discipline violations has made breakthroughs.

Yu Jianrong said that since this year, the Supervision Department has received 110 leads regarding provincial and ministerial-level cadres' issues. The entire supervision system has received more than 1,000 leads regarding bureau-level cadres' issues. Among the 35 major cases that the Supervision Department has focused on, 17 have been concluded so far. Of these 35 major cases, 12 involve provincial and ministerial-level cadres, of which 3 have been investigated and dealt with, 5 have been investigated and are awaiting processing, and 4 are currently under investigation.

Yu Jianrong made these remarks while reporting to the 10th session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee on the situation of the supervision departments' fight against corruption this year and the next steps in their work. According to statistics, from January to September, the national supervision system received 136,757 leads regarding supervision objects' law and discipline violations, investigated and handled 36,323 cases, equivalent to 166.88% of last year's total; concluded 30,018 cases, equivalent to 130.95% of last year's total; gave administrative penalties to 21,315 people, including 1,101 county and bureau-level cadres; and transferred 2,075 people to judicial authorities for handling. The handling of these cases has recovered economic losses for the state totaling more than 300 million yuan and 647,000 Hong Kong dollars.

Yu Jianrong said that currently, various levels of supervision departments are, according to the deployment of various levels of party committees and governments, formulating or participating in the formulation of feasible regulations and measures to punish corruption, screening and selecting leads of cases already in their possession, choosing good breakthrough points, and striving to handle a batch of major cases in the near future.

Yu Jianrong introduced that in the process of handling major cases, the central party leadership, the National People's Congress, and the State Council leaders have paid great attention. Some important cases were personally handled by central leaders, who also supervised and guided the handling of these cases. Local party committees, people's congresses, and governments have also provided strong guidance and assistance to the supervision departments' handling of cases. This is an important guarantee for the significant progress made in the work of handling cases this year.

Yu Jianrong said that the winds of intercession, networks of connections, and some units' lax discipline have interfered with the supervision departments' work of handling cases. In the process of handling cases, the supervision departments often encounter people, even leading cadres, who intercede on behalf of violators and try to downplay their responsibilities, attempting to turn major issues into minor ones and minor ones into nothing. We sincerely request that various levels of party committees, people's congresses, and governments further strengthen their leadership over supervision work and support us in carrying out supervision work according to law. At the same time, we are studying how to strengthen the business leadership of higher-level supervision departments over lower-level supervision departments to ensure the normal operation of the work.

　　一批领导干部违法违纪案得到查处
    新华社北京10月25日电　监察部部长尉健行今天在这里说，今年以来，各级监察机关把开展反腐败斗争、查处违法违纪案件放到突出位置，集中力量查处了一批贪污受贿、以权谋私、“官倒”和奢侈浪费等方面的案件，一批领导干部违法违纪案件的查处得以突破。
    尉健行说，今年以来，监察部受理的反映省部级干部问题的线索110件，整个监察系统受理厅局级干部的问题1000多件。监察部重点查办的35个大要案，截至目前已查结17件。35个大要案中，涉及省部级干部的有12件，其中已查清处理的有3件，已查清待处理的5件，正在查的有4件。
    尉健行是在向七届全国人大常委会第10次会议作关于监察机关今年以来开展反腐败斗争的情况及下一步工作的汇报时介绍这些情况的。据统计，1至9月，全国监察系统共受理监察对象违法违纪问题136757件，立案查处36323件，相当于去年全年的166.88％；结案30018件，相当于去年的130.95％；给予行政处分的有21315人，其中县处级以上干部1101人；移送司法机关处理的2075人。查处案件共为国家挽回经济损失人民币3亿多元、港币64.7万元。
    尉健行说，目前各级监察机关正按照各级党委和政府的部署，制定或参与制定切实可行的惩治腐败的规定和措施，清理、筛选已掌握的案件线索，选好突破口，力争在近期内查处一批大案要案。
    尉健行介绍说，在查处重大案件过程中，党中央、全国人大和国务院领导同志都十分重视，有些重要案件是中央领导同志亲自批办，并督促和指导查处的。地方各级党委、人大和政府对监察机关查办案件也给予了有力的指导和帮助。这是今年以来办案工作所以能取得较大进展的重要保证。
    尉健行说，说情风、关系网以及一些单位执纪不严干扰了监察机关的办案工作。监察机关在查处案件中，往往有一些人，甚至是领导干部出面为违纪者说情、开脱责任，企图大事化小，小事化了。我们恳切要求各级党委、人大和政府进一步加强对监察工作的领导，支持我们依法开展监察工作。同时，我们正在研究如何强化上级监察机关对下级监察机关的业务领导，以保证工作的正常运转。
