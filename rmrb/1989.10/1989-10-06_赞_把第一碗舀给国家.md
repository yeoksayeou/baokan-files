	Praising "Scooping the First Bowl for the Country"
	Gù Chánghuá

	The national grain sales model, farmer Hé Xuéshān from Zhangwan Township, Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, had his 80-plus mu of wheat fields affected by disasters this year. Despite this, he chose to eat blackened bread at home and insisted on selling 30,000 kilograms of good wheat to the state, exceeding the mandatory purchase quota by more than 20,000 kilograms. He sincerely said, "When the country is in trouble, how can we not scoop the first bowl for the country after harvesting the grain?"

	"Scooping the first bowl for the country"—what simple yet powerful words! In one sentence, they express a heartfelt love for the country and a deep desire to repay it, making one stand in respect. Isn't this spirit of taking responsibility for the country the hope of our nation?

	In the process of achieving the modernization of our motherland, especially when our country is still not very wealthy and faces many difficulties, we need this spirit of hard work and putting the country before the family! Compared to this spirit, how small are those who, when faced with a matter, put personal interests above national interests, even harming the public for personal gain!

	I remember a political commissar from a border defense unit saying a heart-stirring sentence: "Country, country, there is a country before there is a family." The thousands of years of history of our country and the 40 years of socialist construction practice have proven that "country" and "family" are closely related and share weal and woe. Only when the country is strong can the people be rich, and only when the country is prosperous can the family be secure. If every citizen can be like Hé Xuéshān and establish the idea of "scooping the first bowl for the country," then the steps of our great motherland towards prosperity and strength will be greatly accelerated.

    赞“把第一碗舀给国家”
    顾长华
    全国售粮模范、江苏省东海县张湾乡农民何学山承包的80多亩麦田今年受灾后，他宁愿自家经常吃发黑的面饼，硬是把3万公斤好麦子卖给国家，超过定购任务2万多公斤。他感情真切地说：“国家有困难，我们打下粮食怎能不把第一碗先舀给国家呢！”
    “把第一碗先舀给国家”——多么朴实而又响亮的语言！一句话道出了拳拳爱国心，眷眷报国情，令人肃然起敬。这种为国分忧的主人翁精神，不正是我们民族的希望所在吗？
    在实现祖国四化建设的进程中，尤其是在我国目前还不太富裕、困难较多的情况下，多么需要这种艰苦奋斗、先国后家的精神呵！那种一事当前，把小家的利益放在国家利益之上，甚至为己而损公的思想和行为，同这种精神相比，是何等渺小！
    记得我边防部队一位团政委讲过这样一句感人肺腑的话：“国家，国家，有国才有家”。我国数千年的历史和社会主义建设40年的实践证明：“国”与“家”休戚与共，密切相关，国强才能民富，国泰方能家安，如果每个公民都能像何学山那样，树立“把第一碗舀给国家”的观念，那么我们伟大祖国繁荣昌盛的步伐就会大大加快。
