    Sewing the First National Flag
    Zhao Wenrui

    On October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao pressed the button on Tiananmen Square, raising the first five-star red flag of New China. At that time, I was standing just a few meters away from the flagpole. Watching the flag rise, my heart was so excited it felt like it would jump out of my throat, and my eyes were blurred with tears. I was so happy because this first flag was sewn by my own hands!

    Forty years have passed, but this event is forever etched in my memory. Before liberation, who would have taken notice of a woman like me? At that time, to maintain a basic living, I ran around everywhere, mending and washing clothes for others, earning very little. My family struggled to have enough to eat. I yearned for a better life so much! That day finally came, and the people's government introduced me to a job, making me a worker at the Art Supply Store.

    One day in the autumn of 1949, a jeep took me and several colleagues to Huairentang in Zhongnanhai. It turned out that the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was about to be held there, and we were to participate in the preparations. I was assigned to make curtains and tablecloths. At that time, there was only one sewing machine, and it was borrowed. I ate and slept by the machine, working day and night without rest, feeling like I had endless energy.

    One night, as we were working hard, we heard a familiar voice: "It's quite lively here! Comrades, you've worked hard!" Looking up, we saw a man with a bright gaze and dignified appearance. It was Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai! He asked us about our well-being and instructed the staff to take good care of our lives and rest, making us feel warm inside.

    On September 21, the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was grandly held in Huairentang. A few days later, a colleague from the conference preparation committee came to the Art Supply Store and handed me a design and requirements for the five-star red flag, saying, "This is the design of the national flag of the People's Republic of China, just approved by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The task of making the first five-star red flag is entrusted to you!"

    I took the new flag design with both hands, and tears of joy welled up in my eyes. This was the trust of the Party and the government, the hope of 400 million people! A sense of pride and happiness welled up from the depths of my heart.

    I bought large pieces of red satin and yellow brocade from the Ruyi Xiang fabric store in the outer city. I pondered over how to cut and sew them. According to the flag-making method announced by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I cut out two large five-pointed stars and eight small five-pointed stars from the yellow brocade, precisely sticking them on both sides of the red satin flag, aligning the five points perfectly. There was no large table inside, so I lay on the floor, sewing meticulously, stitch by stitch.

    There were only two days left until the closing of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I didn't have time to eat or sleep. When I was tired, my eyelids would droop, and I would accidentally prick my fingers with the needle. Thinking that this flag was the symbol of New China, the blood and sweat of countless revolutionary martyrs, and that I was representing all the people of China in making this flag, I became even more meticulous. The long threads and dense stitches carried my love for New China, my yearning for a new life, and my deep affection for the Party and Chairman Mao.

    At 1:00 PM on September 30, the first five-star red flag was finally completed. The conference staff waiting by my side took the red flag to the Huairentang venue. That afternoon, at the closing ceremony of the first session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De, on behalf of the Presidium, announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Immediately afterward, the first five-star red flag I sewed was displayed to the 634 representatives and more than 300 guests.

    I remember clearly that the flag was 460 centimeters long and 338 centimeters wide.

    At 3:10 PM on October 1, this vivid five-star red flag fluttered in the wind on Tiananmen Square. New China was born! Since then, no matter where I am, whenever I see the national flag, I cannot contain my emotions. Over the years, I have sewn many national flags with my own hands and often taught children together, sometimes participating in solemn flag-raising ceremonies. Although I am already 76 years old, I will still do my best to do something beneficial to the Party and the people, adding a little more red to our sacred five-star red flag.

### 我缝第一面国旗

    我缝第一面国旗
    赵文瑞
    1949年10月1日，北京天安门城楼，毛主席亲手按动电钮，升起了新中国的第一面五星红旗……
    当时，我就站在离旗杆只有十几米远的地方。看着冉冉升起的国旗，我的心激动得要跳出嗓门，双眼让泪水模糊了。我太高兴了，因为这第一面国旗是我亲手缝制的呀！
    40年过去了，可这事件我怎么也不能忘怀。解放前，像我这样一个家庭妇女，谁看得起呀？那时候，为了维持起码的生活，我四处奔波，给人缝补浆洗，收入十分微薄，一家人难得温饱。我多么渴望有一天能过上好日子啊！这一天终于盼来了，人民政府介绍我参加工作，在美术供应社当上了一名工人。
    1949年秋的一天，一辆吉普车把我和几位工友接到中南海怀仁堂。原来，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议即将在这里召开，让我们参加会场的布置工作。我分工制作窗帘和台布。当时只有一台缝纫机，还是借来的呢。我吃住都在机器旁，没日没夜地干，浑身像有使不完的劲儿。
    一天深夜，我们正在埋头干活，耳边传来一个亲切的声音：“这里好热闹嘛！同志们辛苦了！”抬头一看，来人目光炯炯，仪表堂堂，啊，是周恩来副主席！他向大家问长问短，并嘱咐工作人员要照顾好工人们的生活和休息，说得我们一个个心里热乎乎的。
    9月21日，人民政协第一届会议在怀仁堂隆重举行。几天后，大会筹备处的一位同志来到美术供应社，把一份五星红旗图案和制作要求交给我，说：“这是政协会议刚通过的中华人民共和国国旗式样，制作第一面五星红旗的任务就交给你吧！……”
    我双手捧过新的国旗图案，欣喜的泪珠禁不住涌出眼眶。这是党和政府的重托，是4万万人民的希望啊！一种当家做主人的自豪感、幸福感，从我的心海深处油然而生。
    我从前门外瑞蚨祥绸布店买来大幅的红绸料和黄缎料，反复琢磨如何裁剪，如何缝制。按着政协会议公布的国旗制法，我用黄缎子剪出两颗大五角星、8颗小五角星，精确地贴在红绸旗面的正反两面，五角比齐对正。室内没有大的桌面，我就趴在地板上，一针一线密密匝匝地缝制起来。
    离政协会议闭幕只有两天时间了，我顾不上吃饭，也顾不上睡觉。累的时候，上下眼皮直打架，一不小心针尖就刺破手指。想到这面国旗是新中国的标志，是无数革命先烈抛头颅洒热血换来的，我是代表全中国的人民在缝制这面国旗，就愈发精细起来。长长的彩线，密密的针脚，缝进了我对新中国的热爱，织进了我对新生活的向往，也注进了我对党和毛主席的一片深情。
    9月30日下午1点，第一面五星红旗终于缝好了。等在我身边的政协会议的工作人员把这面红旗送到了怀仁堂会场。当天下午，在全国政协一届会议闭幕式上，朱德副主席代表会议主席团宣布中华人民共和国成立，紧接着，我手缝的新中国这第一面国旗，最先展现在634名代表和300多位来宾们面前。
    我记得清清楚楚，这面国旗，长460厘米，高338厘米。
    10月1日下午3时10分，这面鲜艳的五星红旗在天安门广场上空迎风招展。新中国诞生了！以后，无论在什么地方，只要看到国旗，我就抑制不住自己的感情。这几十年来，我又亲手缝制了许多国旗，还经常和孩子们在一起，给他们讲课，有时参加庄严的升国旗仪式。现在我虽然已经76岁了，但是我还要尽我所为，做一点有益于党、有益于人民的事情，为我们神圣的五星红旗增添一点鲜红的颜色。
