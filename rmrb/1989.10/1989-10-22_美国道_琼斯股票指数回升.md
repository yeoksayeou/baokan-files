The New York stock market concluded its trading activities for the week on October 20th, with stock prices rebounding. Last Friday (October 13th), the Dow Jones stock index plummeted by 190.58 points in a single day, dropping to 2,569.26 points, causing widespread panic in the financial sector. During this week (from October 16th to October 20th), the Dow Jones stock index rose by a total of 119.88 points, reaching 2,689.14 points. This week's increase is the fastest since June 1988. However, the stock market is volatile, and it is currently difficult to predict whether this rebound will be sustained.

　　美国道·琼斯股票指数回升
    纽约股票市场二十日结束本周的交易活动，股价回升。上星期五（十月十三日），道·琼斯股票指数一天暴跌一百九十点五八点，降至二千五百六十九点二六点，引起金融界一片恐慌。本周（从十月十六日至二十日），道·琼斯股票指数总共回升一百一十九点八八点，升至二千六百八十九点一四点，一周上升的幅度是一九八八年六月以来最快的一次。但股市情况变化多端，目前尚难预料这次回升是否持久。
