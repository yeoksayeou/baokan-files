The 69 artworks left by Pu Xinyu, a descendant of the Qing royal family and a renowned painter, have been returned to the Prince Gong Mansion in Beijing after several transfers. These artworks were donated by Wan Gongqian, a Taiwanese-American calligraphy and painting collector and a close friend of Pu Xinyu.

Pu Xinyu (Aisin-Gioro Puyou), the grandson of Prince Gong Yixuan and the son of Zaizhong, lived in the Prince Gong Mansion for several decades. He passed away in Taiwan in 1963. His paintings are renowned alongside those of Zhang Daqian, earning him the title "South Zhang, North Pu."

Wan Gongqian, who moved from Taiwan to the United States, is a former member of the "Executive Yuan Council." Last autumn, during a visit to the mainland to meet relatives and travel, he visited the Prince Gong Mansion, which was under renovation at the time. He immediately expressed his wish to donate part of the collected works of Pu Xinyu to the Prince Gong Mansion.

    溥心畬遗作返归恭王府
    本报讯　清王族后裔、国画大师溥心畬的69件遗作几经辗转，最近返归北京溥心畬故居恭王府与观众见面。这些遗作是旅美台胞、书画收藏家万公潜先生捐赠的。溥心畬（爱新觉罗·溥儒）系清恭亲王奕?之孙、载滢之子，曾在恭王府住过几十年，1963年在台湾病逝。其国画与张大千齐名，有“南张北溥”之誉。
    从台湾移居美国的万公潜先生是溥心畬先生的生前至交，曾任台湾“行政院参议”。前年秋天，万先生来大陆探亲旅游，参观了当时正在整修的恭王府，当即表示愿将所收藏的溥心畬部分遗作赠给恭王府。（夏珺）
