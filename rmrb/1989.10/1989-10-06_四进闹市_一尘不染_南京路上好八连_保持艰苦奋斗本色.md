    Entering the Bustling Market Four Times, Remaining Spotless
    "The Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" Maintains the Spirit of Hard Work and Self-Denial

    Xinhua News Agency reporter Jie Yan Zhen reports: Facing the new life brought by reform and opening up, the officers and soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company" stationed on Nanjing Road in Shanghai still maintain the spirit of hard work and self-denial.

    The Eighth Company is now on its fourth deployment to Nanjing Road. Compared to 1949, 1956, and 1972, when they were previously stationed on Nanjing Road, the street is now much more prosperous. However, the soldiers of the Eighth Company still sleep on the double beds issued in the 1950s. When on duty on Nanjing Road, they still wear the old cotton socks, yellow plastic slippers, and large-toed liberation shoes issued by the army. In this company, you won't see any leftover rice or steamed buns in the washing basin, nor will you see lights left on or taps left running. They voluntarily adhere to the "five ones" advocated in the 1950s and 1960s: saving one fen of money, one grain of rice, one drop of water, one unit of electricity, and one inch of cloth. Over the past three years, they have saved nearly 10,000 kilograms of grain and over 6,000 kilograms of coal. Except for drinking water, they use well water for everything else. The soldiers in the bustling city do not spend money recklessly and voluntarily deposit their surplus money in the bank. Currently, every soldier has savings in the bank. Once, the Eighth Company was ordered to a construction site at a certain hotel. The soldiers used their spare time to collect usable building materials from the garbage, worth over 14,000 yuan.

    The Eighth Company's adherence to hard work and self-denial has not been smooth sailing. The trend of high consumption has also blown into the barracks. Thus, a discussion on "How much do we know about the hard work of our parents?" and "Is it honorable to squander the blood and sweat of our parents?" was held in the Eighth Company. This discussion, like a gentle spring rain, seeped into the hearts of the soldiers. Anhui soldier Xie Shi Bing once ran a transportation business at home and brought over 500 yuan when he first joined the company, which was not enough to spend. But now he saves 10 yuan in the bank every month. He not only writes home not to send money but also tells them about the importance of thrift.

    Timely ideological education has enabled the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Company to maintain the glorious tradition of hard work and self-denial. They say that facing the rapidly changing new life brought by reform and opening up, we should not fossilize hard work and self-denial, but rather maintain this fine tradition. Hard work and self-denial can help revolutionaries overcome the difficulties on the road ahead.

    It is precisely by inheriting and carrying forward this virtue that the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Company, when faced with criminals attempting to bribe their way through, can remain unmoved by the large sums of money; and when someone tries to sell yellow songs to them, they can turn a blind eye.

### 四进闹市  一尘不染  “南京路上好八连”保持艰苦奋斗本色

    四进闹市  一尘不染
    “南京路上好八连”保持艰苦奋斗本色
    本报讯　新华社记者揭衍珍报道：面对改革开放带来的新生活，驻上海市南京路上“好八连”的干部战士，仍保持着艰苦奋斗的本色。
    八连如今是第四次进驻南京路。与一九四九年、一九五六年、一九七二年那时进南京路时相比，南京路更加繁华了。而八连战士睡的仍是五十年代配发的双人床。战士们在南京路上执勤，脚上穿的，仍是部队发的那双人称“解放袜”的老纱袜、黄色的塑料凉鞋和大头解放鞋。在这个连队看不到刷碗池里有剩饭、馒头，也看不到长明灯、“常流水”……他们自觉坚持五六十年代倡导的“五个一”（节约一分钱、一粒米、一滴水、一度电、一寸布）。三年来，他们节粮近一万公斤，节煤六千多公斤。除食用水外，其它都用井水。战士在繁华的都市，不乱花钱，自觉把多余的钱存入银行，目前战士在银行人人有存款。有一次，八连奉命去某宾馆建设工地劳动，战士们利用工余时间在垃圾堆里拣回可用的建筑材料价值一万四千余元。
    八连坚持艰苦奋斗并非一帆风顺。高消费风也曾刮进军营。于是，一场“父母养育之恩知多少”，“挥霍父母的血汗钱光彩不光彩”的讨论在八连展开了。这场讨论如霏霏春雨沁入战士们的心田。安徽籍战士谢时兵在家当过运输个体户，刚到连队时，带了五百多元还不够花。但现在他每月在银行存十元，他不仅写信不叫家里再寄钱，还给他们讲勤俭节约的道理。
    及时的思想教育，使八连的干部战士保持着艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。他们说，面对改革开放中迅速变化着的新生活，我们不是把艰苦奋斗凝固化，而是要保持这个优良传统。艰苦奋斗能使革命者战胜前进道路上的困难。
    八连官兵正是继承和发扬这种美德，所以当不法分子企图闯“关”，将大把大把的钱用于行贿时，执勤的战士能够不为所动；当有人拿着黄色歌片追着战士叫卖时，他们能够不屑一顾。
