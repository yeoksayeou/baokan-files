To formulate a social development plan for a large economic region, it is first necessary to clarify the strategic issues. Over the past three years since the establishment of the State Council's Northeast Economic Region Planning Office, four conferences on economic development strategies have been held. The book includes speeches and remarks made by Gu Zhuoxin, a member of the Central Advisory Commission and former Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Shenyue, Director of the State Council's Northeast Economic Region Planning Office, and Wang Lin, Director of the State Council's Shanghai Economic Region Planning Office, at these conferences. The book analyzes the characteristics of the Northeast Economic Region, identifies the key issues constraining the social and economic development of Northeast China, such as energy and transportation problems, technological renovation of old enterprises in Northeast China, development of agriculture and forestry in Northeast China, as well as issues related to ecological construction, ecological balance, environmental protection, water resources, and the opening up of Northeast China to the outside world, and the development of economic and trade relations with the Soviet Union and Japan. It has formulated several thematic strategic reports and put forward systematic opinions. Based on the research of various thematic strategies, a strategic outline for the economic and social development of the Northeast Economic Region has been written, clearly proposing opinions on the strategic goals, strategic priorities, and implementation steps and measures for the economic and social development of the Northeast Economic Region.
