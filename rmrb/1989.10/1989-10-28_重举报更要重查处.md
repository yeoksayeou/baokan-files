To combat corruption, various regions have established reporting centers, published reporting hotlines, and even some service industries have publicized supervision hotlines. Some have even reported on the "achievements" of reporting, creating a small wave of "reporting fever." These efforts are indeed necessary. However, reporting is not the goal; it is merely an additional channel for the people to supervise administrative affairs and a convenience for exposing lawbreakers and violators of discipline. What is more important is that relevant departments must promptly investigate and handle reported cases.

Since the establishment of reporting centers, significant results have been achieved. However, to maintain the public's enthusiasm for reporting, relevant departments must take concrete actions, dare to tackle difficult cases, and investigate problems. Only then can reporting centers win the hearts of the people and fulfill their intended deterrent effect, making those who intend to do wrong think twice.

To avoid disappointing the reporters, it is suggested that all levels of reporting centers, while maintaining confidentiality, promptly inform those who provide their real names about the progress of the investigation. Additionally, it is recommended to set a time limit for the investigation of various cases, rather than always stating that the case is "under investigation."

### 重举报更要重查处

　　重举报更要重查处
    为了惩治腐败，各地纷纷成立了举报中心，公布了举报电话，甚至连有些服务行业也公布了监督电话，有的还报道了举报“成果”，形成了一股小小的“举报热”。应该说，这些都是十分必要的。但举报不是目的，它只是为人民群众监督政务增加了一个渠道，为检举揭发违法违纪者提供了方便。而更重要的是，有关部门要对举报的案件抓紧查处。
    举报中心建立以来，确实收效不小。但要把群众举报的这种积极性保持下去，有关部门就要动点“真格的”，敢于碰硬，查处问题。这样，举报中心就会得人心，同时也可起到它应有的震慑作用，使那些想做坏事的人有所顾忌。
    为了不致使举报者失望，建议各级举报中心对那些留有真实姓名的举报者，在注意保守秘密的情况下，及时通报查处情况，同时对各类案件的查处期限作个规定，不能老是“正在查处”。
