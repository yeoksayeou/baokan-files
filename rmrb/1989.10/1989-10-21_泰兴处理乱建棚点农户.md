Taixing Addresses Unauthorized Construction of Sheds by Farmers

Your newspaper published a follow-up letter on February 18th on the fifth page, titled "Serious Situation of Illegal Occupation and Use of Arable Land," which reported that some farmers in Koushan Town of our county had built sheds on arable land along both sides of the Jiangping Road without approval from relevant departments. After receiving this report, our bureau, in collaboration with the town government and village committees, conducted multiple rounds of propaganda on the Land Administration Law and issued notices to each household involved in illegal construction. Li Yonglin, the party secretary of Jiangsheng Village in Koushan Town, took the lead in demolishing his illegally built restaurant. Shortly after, four other households voluntarily demolished their illegal constructions, including a truck stop and a restaurant.

Our bureau issued penalty decisions to three households involved in illegal construction. The village, town, and county governments continuously sent personnel to persuade and mobilize, effectively resolving the issue of illegal land occupation and shed construction in this area. A total of 57 sheds were demolished.

　　泰兴处理乱建棚点农户
    你报二月十八日第五版刊登的来信追踪《乱占滥用耕地情况严重》一文，其中反映我县口岸镇少数农户未经有关部门批准，擅自在江平公路两侧的耕地上乱建棚点的问题后，我局配合镇政府、村委会先后多次向违章建房户宣传土地法，逐户下发了镇政府的通告。口岸镇江圣村党支部书记李永林带头拆掉了自己擅自修建的饭店，不久又有四家违章建房户自动拆掉了大车行、饭店。
    我局对三家违章建房户下发了处罚决定书，村、镇、县不断派人进行动员说服，基本解决了这一地段非法占地乱建棚点问题，共拆掉棚点五十七间。
