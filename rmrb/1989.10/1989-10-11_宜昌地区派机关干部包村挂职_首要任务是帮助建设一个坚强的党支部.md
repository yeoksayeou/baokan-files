    Yichang Region Dispatches Officials to Villages for Temporary Assignments
    Primary Task is to Help Build a Strong Party Branch

    WUHAN, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) — The Yichang region in Hubei Province has found an effective way to revitalize backward village party branches: dispatching outstanding officials from government agencies to villages for temporary assignments or to assist with work.

    After investigating the rural situation, the Yichang Regional Committee discovered that about 10 percent of the villages had slow economic development and were long-term impoverished. The main reason was the lack of fighting spirit in the local party organizations. The Regional Committee decided to select capable party and government officials to work in the villages or assist with work. In 1988, the region selected 100 officials to work in the villages, with significant results. This year, 572 officials were dispatched to backward villages for temporary assignments or to take on leadership roles, with 112 of them serving as village party branch secretaries. For these officials working in the villages, the Regional Committee, in addition to setting clear work terms and specific indicators for building a civilized society, also required them to prioritize helping to build a strong village party branch.

    Officials from government agencies working in the villages not only improve their practical work skills and strengthen their ties with the people but also quickly change the situation of some village branches that were in a state of paralysis, restoring the party organization's vitality and dynamism. According to a sample survey of 20 villages, 17 of them have shed the "backward" label, and 8 of them have selected qualified party branch secretaries from within the village.

    Officials from government agencies working in the villages lead the party branch's leadership team to do practical things for the people, enhancing the party's prestige, and mobilizing party members to make friends with returning educated youth and other advanced elements, strengthening the party's cohesion. Last year, the Wufeng County Committee dispatched a county-level government official to Shuitou Village to serve as the party branch secretary. Over the past year, this official spent more than 200 days in the village, focusing on production while also mobilizing the people to raise funds to build a 5-kilometer high-voltage power line and a 3.8-kilometer road, improving the village's appearance. Last year, a new party member was recruited, and after being confirmed, recently took on the role of village party branch secretary.

    These officials working in the villages generally have higher cultural and scientific knowledge and a broader perspective. They lead the people to break free from the constraints of a natural economy, recognize local resource advantages, and promote scientific farming techniques. Yichang County's Aopengzi Village has only 3 mu of land per person, and more than 300 laborers had no work. The village cadres were at a loss. In March last year, the county organization department sent young official Tan Yeming to the village to serve as the party branch secretary. Together with the people, he formulated a plan to "improve scientific farming in the short term to fill stomachs and develop wasteland in the long term to increase strength." That year, the per capita grain increased by 35 kilograms, and orchards and chestnut bases were established on the barren mountains, arranging work for more than 200 laborers, giving the people a glimpse of the prospect of getting rich.

### 宜昌地区派机关干部包村挂职  首要任务是帮助建设一个坚强的党支部

    宜昌地区派机关干部包村挂职
    首要任务是帮助建设一个坚强的党支部
    本报武汉电　记者龚达发报道：湖北省宜昌地区找到一条治理农村后进党支部的好办法——选派优秀机关干部到村挂职或包村帮助工作。
    宜昌地委在对农村形势调查后发现，有10％左右的村经济发展缓慢，长期处于贫困落后状态。究其原因，主要是当地党组织缺乏战斗力。地委决定选派得力的党政机关干部到村任职或包村帮助工作。1988年，全区选派100名干部到村工作，很有成效。今年又派出572名干部到后进村包村、任职，其中112人担任村党支部书记。对这些到村任职的干部，地委除规定了明确的工作期限和两个文明建设的具体指标外，还要求他们把帮助建设一个坚强的村党支部作为首要任务。
    机关干部到村任职除锻炼干部实际工作能力、密切与人民群众的联系外，第一个成效就是使一些处于瘫痪状态的村支部有了“领班人”，迅速改变了“群龙无首”状况，党组织恢复了生机和活力。据对其中20个村的抽样调查，有17个村已经甩掉了“落后”帽子，有8个村还从本村选出了合格的党支部书记。
    到村任职的机关干部带领支部“一班人”一方面为群众办实事、提高党的威信，一方面发动党员与回乡知识青年和其他先进分子交朋友，增强党的凝聚力。去年，五峰县委选派1名县直机关干部到水滩头村任党支书。一年来这位干部扎在村里200多天，除抓好当年生产外，还动员群众集资架设了5公里高压电线路，修了3.8公里公路，山村面貌初步改观。去年发展的1名新党员，转正后于最近担任了村党支部书记。
    这些到村任职的机关干部一般都有较高的文化科学知识和比较开阔的眼界。他们带领群众摆脱自然经济束缚，认识本地资源优势，推广科学种田技术。宜昌县幺棚子村人均3分地，300多名劳力无活干，村干部束手无策。去年3月，县委组织部青年干部谭业明到村任支部书记，和群众一道制定了“近期科学种田饱肚子，长远开发荒地增后劲”的规划，当年人均增加口粮35公斤，在荒山上建起柑桔、板栗基地，安排了200多名劳力，使群众看到了致富前景。
