The third Chinese Go Ten-Strong Tournament held its final round today at the China-Japan Go Institute to determine the rankings. Renowned player Nie Weiping, a 9-dan, defeated his last opponent, Ma Xiaochun, also a 9-dan, to secure the top spot once again. Ma Xiaochun took the second place.

Since Nie Weiping has consecutively ranked first for three times, the championship trophy will permanently belong to him. The organizers will set up a new trophy for future tournaments.

In the match for the third place, the national women's champion Ke Jie, a 9-dan, defeated the dual champion of "Meijin" and "Tianyuan," Liu Xiaoliang, also a 9-dan. This is the best result ever achieved by a female player in a high-level domestic tournament. Her outstanding performance has been highly praised by experts.
