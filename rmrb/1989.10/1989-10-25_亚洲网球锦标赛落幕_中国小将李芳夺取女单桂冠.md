The 1989 Asian Tennis Championships concluded today with the final four matches. Sixteen-year-old Li Fang from Hunan defeated the defending champion, Wang Sizheng from Chinese Taipei, to fill a gap in China's gold medal tally for this major Asian tennis event. However, her male teammates failed to secure victories, allowing South Korea to retain the men's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles titles.

Li Fang performed exceptionally well today. Using clever net play and varied shot placements, she kept Wang Sizheng, who is strong on the forehand but weak on the backhand, in a defensive position, causing her to make frequent errors and struggle to score points. Wang Sizheng lost the first set 4-6, and in the second set, she managed to equalize the score at 6-6, thanks to her rich match experience. However, in the long rally, Li Fang did not relent, using her precise serves to create opportunities for aggressive play, winning seven consecutive points to secure the final victory.

Today, Chinese players also lost in the men's singles and doubles finals due to slow footwork and missed opportunities. As a result, Kim Jae-deok from South Korea defeated Zhang Jiuhua 2-0, and Kim Jae-deok and Bae Nam-su defeated Zhang Jiuhua and Xia Jiaping 2-0. The mixed doubles champions were also from South Korea. Earlier, South Korean players also won the women's doubles title.

This competition, seen as a prelude to the Beijing Asian Games tennis gold medals, has now concluded. The Chinese tennis team, which was formed last year, announced that they would donate the $1,750 prize money they won in the recent East Asian Tennis Team Championship to the Beijing Asian Games Organizing Committee.

　　亚洲网球锦标赛落幕
　　中国小将李芳夺取女单桂冠
    本报北京10月24日讯　记者缪鲁报道：1989年亚洲网球锦标赛今天在此间进行了最后4场决赛。年仅16岁的湖南姑娘李芳战胜上届女子单打冠军、中国台北名将王思婷，填补了中国在这一亚洲网坛大赛金牌榜上的空白，但她的男队友们则冲击未果，使南朝鲜队得以保住了男子单打、双打和混合双打的桂冠。
    李芳在今天表现出色，她以巧妙的网前球和路线多变的抽击，使擅长正手攻击而反拍薄弱的王思婷始终处于被动局面，频频失误，得分乏术。王思婷先以4∶6丢掉第一盘，第二盘王思婷凭借丰富的临场经验将比分扳至6平，但在长局赛中，李芳毫不手软，利用落点刁钻的发球连连制造抢攻机会，一口气拿下7分，赢得最后胜利。
    今天，中国选手在男子单打和双打决赛中的失利，皆因脚步移动慢，未能把握住机会球所致。结果，南朝鲜的金载堤以2∶0胜张九华，金载堤和裴南主以2∶0胜张九华和夏加平。获混合双打冠亚军的都是南朝鲜选手。在此之前，南朝鲜选手还夺得女双冠军。
    至此，被称为角逐北京亚运会网球金牌前哨战的这次比赛全部结束。赛后，去年才组建的中国网球队宣布，将该队在前些天的东亚网球团体赛所获的1750美元的奖金，全部捐赠给北京亚运会组委会。
