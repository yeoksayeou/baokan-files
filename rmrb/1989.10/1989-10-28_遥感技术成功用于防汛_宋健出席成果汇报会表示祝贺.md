    Remote Sensing Technology Successfully Applied to Flood Control
    Song Jian Attends Results Presentation Meeting to Offer Congratulations

    Xinhua News Agency reporter Pu Liye, and People's Daily reporter Jiang Xia report from Beijing: The State Science and Technology Commission held a large-scale results presentation meeting for the flood control remote sensing application experiment in Beijing today, reporting and showcasing the abundant achievements made in China's flood control remote sensing application experiments over the past three years. Experts attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the results of using remote sensing technology to monitor the water situation of the Yellow River, among other achievements, are leading both domestically and internationally.

    Vice Premier and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian and other leaders attended the meeting, listened to the reports, and inspected the results of the flood control remote sensing application experiment.

    Since 1987, the State Science and Technology Commission has organized the Ministry of Water Resources, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, the Air Force, the State Meteorological Administration, the State Education Commission, and the China Satellite Communications Company, among other units, to conduct flood control remote sensing application experiments in the Yongding River, the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the Jingjiang-Dongting Lake area, and the Huai River. Each year, significant breakthroughs have been made, contributing importantly to disaster prevention and reduction of disaster losses.

    Minister Song Jian extended congratulations to the scientific and technological personnel who participated in the implementation of the aforementioned flood control remote sensing application achievements. Song Jian said, "China is a country with frequent natural disasters. To achieve disaster reduction and prevention, we must rely on science and technology."

　　遥感技术成功用于防汛
　　宋健出席成果汇报会表示祝贺
    本报北京10月26日讯　新华社记者蒲立业、本报记者江夏报道：国家科委今天在京举行防汛遥感应用试验大型汇报会，汇报和展示3年来我国防汛遥感应用实验所取得的丰硕成果。与会专家一致认为，这次展示的应用遥感技术监测黄河水情等部分成果，在国内外均处于领先地位。
    国务委员、国家科委主任宋健等领导同志出席会议，听取汇报并参观了防汛遥感应用试验成果。
    自1987年以来，国家科委连续3年组织水利部、中国科学院、国家测绘局、空军、国家气象局、国家教委、中国广播卫星公司等单位，在永定河、黄河下游、荆江洞庭湖区和淮河，进行了防汛遥感应用试验，每年都取得了突破性进展，为防治灾害和减少灾害损失做出了重要贡献。
    宋健主任向参加实施上述防汛遥感应用成果的科技人员表示祝贺。宋健说，我国是一个自然灾害较多的国家，要实现减灾、防灾，就必须依靠科学技术。
