Cultivating children's patriotic spirit and socialist moral qualities is one of the most important tasks in Yugoslav primary education. This is not only reflected in classroom textbooks but also in many lively extracurricular activities.

The First Day of School
All primary schools in Yugoslavia are named after figures who made significant contributions to the country's independence and development or after historically significant places. The glorious history is recited in every school, serving as a vivid teaching material for patriotic education.

Recently, the reporter visited a primary school located at the southern end of the People's Army Street in Belgrade. Upon entering the hall, which is as bright as a greenhouse, one's eyes are drawn to a tall bronze statue of the early Yugoslav revolutionary Filip Filipović, after whom the school is named. Filipović joined the revolution in the 1920s and became a key leader of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in the 1930s. He sacrificed his life in February 1938 at the age of 33. Principal K. Vujadinović explained that on the first day of school, new students first listen to the introduction of the revolutionary pioneers' heroic deeds in front of Filipović's bronze statue. They then visit the school's honor room and the exhibition stands featuring martyrs' portraits, writings, relics, and models of the Yugoslav anti-fascist war base and pictures. Every April 20th (the birthday of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia) is the school's anniversary, during which the entire faculty and students invite representatives from Filipović's hometown and other regions to celebrate together.

"The Great Lesson"
On the beautiful land of Yugoslavia, almost every place where significant historical events occurred or where ancestors shed their blood has a monument or statue erected. Some more important places have memorial parks and museums built, which constantly remind people not to forget yesterday, cherish today, and fight for a better tomorrow.

From September 1st to 20th, during the first 20 days of the new school year, Yugoslav students actively participate in the "Long Live the Monuments!" activity. Led by Young Pioneer instructors or old partisans, they visit important memorial parks, museums, and monuments across the country, near and far, to learn and understand the history of the Yugoslav people's struggle for national independence and people's freedom against reactionaries. On October 21st of each year, students from various regions are also selected to go to Kragujevac to participate in "The Great Lesson," a traditional activity held in memory of the martyrs killed by German fascists.

On October 21, 1941, German fascists, in a mad retaliation against the resistance activities of the Yugoslav people, slaughtered more than 7,300 residents from 7 AM to 2 PM in Kragujevac, a city with a population of less than 40,000. Among the victims were more than 300 students, children, and 18 teachers. A teacher, when the Nazis demanded his surrender, said, "Shoot! I am giving my last lesson to the children!" Three years later, on the same day, the People's Army and partisans liberated the city. To forever remember this day, since 1945, every October 21st, elderly people, youth, and especially children from all over the country gather at the October Memorial Park here to hold "The Great Lesson" activity.

Meaningful Activities
In Yugoslavia, around important memorial days, one often sees children wearing red scarves and red star military caps, with reverence in their hearts, cleaning the martyrs' tombs and memorial parks, and making the various monuments and statues shine brightly. They also hold ceremonies to offer flowers.

According to Yugoslav comrades, the Young Pioneer organizations of each primary school regularly take care of and maintain the nearby martyrs' tombs and memorial parks. The district councils also award certificates to schools that do well in this activity. The reporter visited a primary school named after seven Yugoslav Communist Youth League secretaries who were killed by the reactionary government in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Over the decades, students have come and gone, but the tradition of maintaining and cleaning the tombs of these seven martyrs has never stopped.

Yugoslav primary schools also often organize students to collect waste paper, old bottles, and old plastic bags, gather various medicinal plants, and engage in beneficial social labor. They donate the income earned to relevant units to build memorial halls. When the Tito Memorial Hall was built, many students donated their savings in dinars to express their affection and respect for Tito. During my visit to the honor room of Filip Filipović Primary School, I saw a letter of thanks from Tito's hometown.

Every summer vacation, many primary schools also sign up to join various voluntary labor teams named after martyrs in their region, working as little helpers with older brothers and sisters to build roads, construct houses, and dredge rivers, beautifying the motherland with their labor...

Principal Vujadinović concluded the introduction by saying to the reporter, "Yugoslav primary schools organize this series of meaningful activities in accordance with the unified education curriculum to plant the love for the motherland deeply in the hearts of children. This way, they understand from a young age the profound meaning and heavy weight of the words 'motherland' and the sacrifices made by their ancestors. It encourages them to love the motherland, study hard for the motherland now, and work for the motherland when they grow up, contributing everything to the motherland."

    让祖国在孩子心中扎根
    ——南斯拉夫小学爱国主义传统教育纪实
    本报记者  严正
    培养儿童的爱国主义精神和社会主义道德品质，在南斯拉夫是小学教育的最重要任务之一。它不仅贯穿于课堂书本之中，而且也体现在许多生动活泼的课外活动中。
    入学第一天
    南斯拉夫所有小学都用为祖国独立和发展作出重要贡献的人物的名字或有历史意义的地名命名。光辉的历史故事在每所小学里传颂，成为进行生动的爱国主义教育的活教材。
    不久前，记者采访了坐落在贝尔格莱德人民军大街南端的一所小学。迈进花房般的门厅，映入眼帘的是一尊在少先队旗帜掩映下的高大铜像，那就是南斯拉夫早期革命家菲·菲利波维奇，这所小学就是以他的名字命名的。菲利波维奇二十年代投身革命，三十年代成为南共的主要领导人，1938年2月献出生命时年仅33岁。校长科·芙加奥琳卡介绍说，新生入学的第一天首先要在菲利波维奇铜像前听取革命先驱的英雄事迹介绍，接着参观学校的荣誉室和陈列着烈士遗像、遗著、遗物及南斯拉夫反法西斯战争根据地模型、图片的展台。每年4月20日（即南共的生日）是这所小学的校庆日，届时，全校师生邀请菲利波维奇家乡以及其他地区的同名小学的代表一起举行庆祝活动。
    “伟大的一课”
    在南斯拉夫的美丽国土上，凡是发生过重大历史事件或先辈们洒过鲜血的地方，几乎都树立了纪念碑或雕像，一些比较重要的地方还建立了纪念公园和纪念馆，它们时刻提醒人们不要忘记昨天，珍惜今天，为美好的明天而战斗。
    每年9月1日至20日新学年开始的头20天，南斯拉夫的小学生都会积极参加“纪念碑万岁！”的活动，他们在少先队辅导员或老游击队员的带领下，由近及远地参观全国各地重要的纪念公园、纪念馆和纪念碑，学习和了解南斯拉夫人民为祖国独立、人民自由同反动派殊死斗争的历史。每年10月21日这一天，各地区的小学生还要选派自己的代表去克拉库耶瓦茨参加“伟大的一课”，那是为纪念被德国法西斯枪杀的烈士们举行的传统活动。
    1941年10月21日，德国法西斯为了对南斯拉夫人民的抵抗活动进行疯狂报复，从上午7时至下午2时，在总人口不到4万的克拉库耶瓦茨连续屠杀了7300多名居民，其中有300多名小学生、儿童和18名老师。有一位老师在纳粹要他投降时说：“开枪吧，我给孩子们上最后一课！”3年后的同一天，南人民军和游击队解放了这个城市。为了永远记住这一天，从1945年起，每年10月21日，来自全国各地的老人、青年特别是孩子们聚集到这里的10月纪念公园举行“伟大的一课”活动。
    有意义的活动
    在南斯拉夫的一些重要纪念日前后，人们经常可以看到一些戴着红领巾和小红星军帽的孩子们怀着崇敬的心情，把烈士墓和纪念公园打扫得干干净净，把各种纪念碑和雕像擦得明亮闪光。他们还举行仪式，敬献鲜花。
    据南斯拉夫同志介绍，各小学的少先队组织都把保护、整修附近的烈士陵墓和纪念公园作为经常性的活动，各个区的议会还给此项活动开展得好的小学校颁发奖状。记者采访了以二十年代末三十年代初被反动当局杀害的7位南斯拉夫共青团书记名字命名的小学校，数十年来学生换了一批又一批，但他们维护和打扫上述7位烈士墓的传统从未间断过。
    南斯拉夫小学还经常组织学生搜集废纸、旧瓶、旧塑料袋等废旧物品，采集各种药用植物，开展有益的社会劳动，他们把获得的收入捐赠给有关单位修建纪念馆。铁托故居修建纪念馆时，许多小学生都捐出了自己积蓄的第纳尔，以此表达对铁托的爱戴和感情，我在参观菲·菲利波维奇小学的荣誉室时，看到了铁托家乡写来的感谢信。
    每到暑假，不少小学还报名参加本地区以烈士名字命名的各种义务劳动队，作为小帮手与大哥哥大姐姐一起筑路、建房、疏通河道，以自己的劳动美化祖国……
    芙加奥琳卡校长在结束介绍时对记者说，南斯拉夫小学遵照统一的教育大纲组织这一系列有意义的活动，是为了让祖国在孩子的心中牢牢扎根，使他们从小就懂得“祖国”两字的深刻含义和千钧重量以及先辈为之付出的代价，鼓励他们热爱祖国，现在为祖国努力学习，长大了为祖国而工作，为祖国贡献一切。
