Shuyang County in Jiangsu Province has fully utilized its local resource advantages, adapted to the demands of the international market, and established an initial export production system that integrates industry, agriculture, and commerce. This has brought about new changes in the county's economic structure. Since last year, the total value of export goods provided has reached 30.038 million yuan, earning over 4 million US dollars in foreign exchange, an increase of over 1 million US dollars compared to 1986. In the first nine months of this year, the export value reached 13.36 million yuan, a 60.14% increase over the same period last year.

Shuyang County is traditionally an agricultural county with a weak industrial base and low commercialization rate of agricultural and sideline products. In recent years, the county's Party committee and government have guided the local economy by changing the previous structure where farmers planted and raised whatever they wanted, and processed and exported whatever they had. Instead, they have established a structure where they plant, raise, and process whatever the international market needs.

　　沐阳形成出口生产体系
    本报讯　江苏省沭阳县充分发挥本地资源优势，适应国际市场需求，建立起初具规模的贸工农型出口生产体系，全县经济格局发生新的变化。去年以来，提供出口货源总值3003.8万元，创汇达400多万美元，比1986年净增100多万美元；今年1至9月份实现外销额1336万元，比去年同期增长60.14％。
    沭阳县是传统的农业县，工业基础差，农副产品商品率低，近年来，县委、县政府因势利导，一改过去农民种植、养殖什么就安排加工、出口什么的农工贸型结构，建立了国际市场需要什么就种植、养殖、加工什么的贸工农型结构。（沈根　袁海）
