	The Red Army University's Excellent Teacher
	— Remembering Comrade Zhang Jichun's Achievements During the Long March
	Xú Guāngyì

	Every autumn, the wind is strong, and the maple leaves do not turn red until they have been touched by frost. In this season of golden autumn, the maple leaves across the mountains are ablaze with fiery red, adorned across this beautiful and bountiful land of China. Twenty-one years ago today, our Party's outstanding Party member, revolutionary of the proletariat, and our Party and Army's outstanding political work leader, Comrade Zhang Jichun, was cruelly persecuted by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing anti-Party cliques and died unjustly. I am deeply saddened and deeply miss my respected leader and teacher...

	(1)

	In September 1935, Zhang Guotao departed from the Central Political Bureau's decision at the Erhekou meeting, openly splitting the Party and the Red Army. He deceived and misled tens of thousands of Red Army cadres and soldiers to march south. Comrades Zhu De and Liu Bocheng adhered to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's correct policy of "unity and northward advance to resist Japan." To cultivate and educate cadres and guide them to implement the correct line of the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, the Red Army University was established in the headquarters of the Fourth Red Army in Songang, Sichuan (now north of Jinchuan County). Liu Bocheng, the Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, served as the president and political commissar. In late September, I was selected to study advanced political science at the "Red Army University." Not long after the "Red Army University" was established in Songang, it moved south along the Dajinchuan to the Shalini area north of Jinchuan County. Here, the school leadership was strengthened, and Zhang Jichun was transferred to the "Red Army University" to serve as a political instructor. Later, he became the director of the Political Department and the main political instructor. I had the honor of listening to Comrade Jichun's lectures and later worked directly under his leadership. His noble character, outstanding abilities, and significant contributions to political work in our army left a deep impression on me.

	When Comrade Zhang Jichun was transferred to the "Red Army University," the Fourth Red Army, under Zhang Guotao's arbitrary command, had begun to march south. On October 5, the troops arrived in the Zhumudiao area, where Zhang Guotao openly established the so-called "Temporary Central Committee" and "Central Military Commission" and other illegal organizations, appointing himself as "Chairman." His splitist activities reached their peak. Comrade Jichun stood firmly with Comrades Zhu De and Liu Bocheng, focusing on the overall situation of the Party and the Red Army's life and death, disregarding personal honor and disgrace, and actively maintaining unity among the soldiers and officers of the First and Fourth Front Armies. This helped to minimize losses when the southward march failed. Soon after arriving at the "Red Army University," he sought to understand the situation from relevant comrades. He never hid his political views but appropriately expressed his opinions according to the Party's organizational principles and engaged in unrelenting struggle against Zhang Guotao's splitist actions.

	Before crossing the Jiajinshan Mountain, some comrades, deceived by Zhang Guotao, composed a song called "The Red Army's Southward March," which slandered the Party Central Committee and Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai for leading the main force of the First Front Army to march north to resist Japan as "fleeing northward." When President Liu Bocheng heard that some comrades at the "Red Army University" were teaching this song, he immediately criticized it seriously, forbidding everyone from singing such a song that split the Party and the Red Army, and stopping its spread. At the same time, Comrade Jichun patiently explained the facts and logic to everyone, educating comrades to correctly understand that the Party Central Committee and Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai leading part of the Red Army to march north to resist Japan was a decision of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, which Zhang Guotao had previously agreed to. It was also a glorious mission given to the Red Army by history. We must be models of maintaining the unity of the Party and the Red Army, working together to protect the people and fight the enemy.

	Although General Zhu De and Chief of Staff Liu Bocheng advised and some comrades resisted, Zhang Guotao was stubborn and insisted on leading the Red Army south to the Min Mountains and Tianquan area, attempting to attack Chengdu. However, they were blocked by a strong enemy and failed to capture Baizhong Pass after seven days and nights of fierce battle. Although this battle resulted in the annihilation of more than 15,000 enemy soldiers, the Red Army also suffered more than 10,000 casualties. Facing the harsh reality of struggle, the broad masses of soldiers and officers gradually gained a clearer understanding and expressed dissatisfaction with Zhang Guotao's southward decision. Especially when the Party Central Committee repeatedly criticized Zhang Guotao's erroneous southward actions and urged him to turn back from the brink and change his course, it forced him to abandon the southward march and head north again. By June 1936, he admitted his mistake and dissolved the fake Central Committee.

	When the troops, in the harsh winter with howling north winds and heavy snow, crossed the Jiajinshan Mountain again, comrades sang a song: "The Red Army marches north, to fight the Japanese. We must be spirited and obey the orders of the Party Central Committee, and our northward advance will surely be victorious." Comrade Jichun heard this and happily said, "We need such revolutionary songs to encourage everyone." He also sang along with the comrades and took the lead in giving his horse to a sick comrade to ride and sharing his rations with the weak and hungry. With an optimistic spirit, he took firm steps to cross the snow mountains and grasslands, heading towards the great victory of the northward march to resist Japan.

	In the struggle against Zhang Guotao's splitist activities, Comrade Zhang Jichun was open-hearted, upright, and fearless. He insisted on the truth, even enduring humiliation and not caring about personal safety. He firmly maintained the unity and solidarity of the Party and the Red Army, demonstrating a high degree of political principle and flexible struggle tactics.

	Comrade Zhang Jichun dedicated himself to the revolution and the people, working diligently, humbly, and carefully. He was practical, theoretical, and realistic, deeply rooted in the masses, conducting investigations and research, promoting democracy, and skillfully determining work guidelines and methods based on actual situations and the sentiments of the masses. He was indeed a model of carrying forward the Party's three major styles.

	In his political courses at the Red Army University, he combined the principles of Marxism-Leninism with the actual struggle at the time, such as crossing snow mountains, traversing grasslands, and insisting on the northward march to resist Japan, opposing Zhang Guotao's right-opportunist escapeism. The purpose of teaching was to cultivate cadres at the Red Army University into leaders who have political awareness, organizational and command abilities, educational and management capabilities, and a spirit of hard struggle and fearlessness of sacrifice. Comrade Jichun, following the instructions of President Liu Bocheng, worked with comrades in the Political Department to jointly study and formulate the teaching plan and implementation scheme for political courses. In addition to insisting on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the ten major policies of the Chinese revolution, he also proposed teaching content based on the actual situation at the time.

	In the process of organizing and implementing the teaching, Comrade Jichun, with his extensive knowledge and deep political theory foundation, made the political course content deep and vivid. He never engaged in empty preaching but, based on the ideological situation and cultural level of the students, patiently and sincerely explained the principles, using vivid and rich language. He often used humorous and witty analogies and stories to make the points very clear. He also combined the history of social development and the history of the two-line struggle in the Party's construction (i.e., Lenin's debate with Martov on the issue of Party construction) to discuss ancient and modern events, gradually opening the minds and broadening the horizons of the comrades, continuously improving their ideological awareness. In the harsh environment, through the understanding of actual struggles, they further recognized the serious errors of Zhang Guotao's splitist actions against the Party and the Red Army, more firmly maintained the correct line of the Party Central Committee, and strengthened the unity between the soldiers and officers of the First and Fourth Front Armies.

	Like President Liu Bocheng, Comrade Jichun not only personally organized and implemented the teaching plan but also often went among the students to understand the teaching situation and participated in listening to lectures and discussions with the students. He patiently and carefully answered the difficult questions raised by the students. He also mobilized the students to use their spare time to publish wall newspapers, such as the "Warfire" wall newspaper, which was published once a week for a total of 9 issues. The content of the wall newspaper reflected the learning, living, and ideological situations of the students. Everyone wrote articles, and the wall newspaper was lively and meaningful. When in Hongyan Bank, Comrade Jichun also started the "Red Army University" school newspaper "Red Furnace." President Liu Bocheng personally wrote the title and inscribed: "Our school is a red furnace. We study military, political, and cultural subjects and fight against all adverse natural environments, overcome all difficulties, and temper ourselves in this 'red furnace.' A strong revolutionary will is tempered in the red-hot furnace." The "Red Furnace" school newspaper was published for a total of 17 issues, starting with a four-page format and using stencil printing, later changing to a booklet format.

	In January 1936, the "Red Army University" established the Intermediate Cadres Regiment in Tianquan, appointing Chen Bocheng as the regiment commander, with the Military Company and Political Company under his command. Gan Yanlin was the company commander of the Military Company, and I was the political instructor; Pi Dingjun was the company commander of the Political Company, and Huang Zhiyong was the political instructor. After the "Red Army University" moved to Luhuo, it continued to enroll 400 military and division-level cadres to organize the second term of the Advanced Command Course, Senior Command Course, and Senior Political Course. At the same time, it also expanded the Infantry School. At that time, the regiment and the school leadership had about 1,500 people, living together with the headquarters in the Luhuo temple.

	In June 1936, Comrades He Long, Ren Bishi, Guan Xiangying, and Xiao Ke led the Second and Sixth Red Army Corps to arrive in Ganzi and met with the Fourth Red Army, continuing their northward march. In July, after the graduates of the Intermediate Cadres Regiment, I was transferred to the Political Department of the "Red Army University" to serve as the deputy director of the Local Work Section. In August, the "Red Army University" set out from Luhuo with the headquarters of the Fourth Red Army, passing through Langmusi Monastery, Gacu River, and Baozuo, heading north.

	The "Red Army University" stayed in Luhuo for more than five months, with very little food. Therefore, the troops prepared only 2 liang (about 100 grams) of fried noodles per person per day for crossing the grasslands, mainly relying on wild vegetables to fill their stomachs. Our Local Work Section was fully responsible for organizing and implementing mass work and food procurement.

	Carrying out mass work and procuring grain and fodder in minority areas was a highly policy-oriented task. Comrade Jichun repeatedly organized us to study the Party's policies on nationalities and religion, seriously research methods for carrying out mass work, and formulate implementation plans and precautions for procuring grain and fodder. He particularly emphasized respecting the customs and living habits of minority nationalities and selected comrades with strong policy awareness to form procurement teams to act with the advance units of the marching troops. The soldiers in the procurement teams overcame various difficulties, broke through the enemy's heavy blockade, and procured some food in the sparsely populated snow mountains, grasslands, and minority areas, supplementing part of the troops' food supply and achieving significant results.

	After the "December 12 Incident," the Central Red Army University moved to Yan'an with the Party Central Committee leadership and was renamed the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

	Comrade Zhang Jichun, as one of the organizers and leaders of the Red Army University, firmly implemented the Party's educational policies, maintained the unity and solidarity of the Party and the Red Army, and clearly opposed right-opportunism with Comrades Zhu De and Liu Bocheng. He dedicated a great deal of effort to cultivating a large number of outstanding Red Army cadres and established immortal merits. Comrade Jichun's brilliant achievements throughout his revolutionary life will forever be recorded in the glorious history of our Party and Army. His revolutionary spirit continues to inspire later generations to strive for the modernization of our country!

    “红大”良师
    ——回忆张际春同志长征中的业绩
    胥光义
    一年一度秋风劲，枫不经霜色不红。时值金秋季节，漫山遍野的枫叶又吐着炽热的红焰，点缀这块美丽富饶的神州大地。21年前的今天，我党优秀党员、无产阶级革命家、我党我军杰出的政治工作领导者张际春同志，惨遭林彪和江青反党集团的残酷迫害，含冤离开了人世。我怀着无比沉痛的心情，深深缅怀我尊敬的领导和良师……
    （一）
    1935年9月，张国焘背离中央政治局两河口会议决定，公开分裂党和红军，蒙蔽、欺骗数万红军干部、战士南下，朱德、刘伯承等同志坚持党中央和毛主席“团结一致，北上抗日”的正确方针，为培养教育干部，引导他们执行以毛主席为首的党中央的正确路线，在红四方面军总部所在地川西松岗（今金川县以北）成立了红军大学，由中国工农红军总参谋长刘伯承任校长兼政治委员。9月下旬，我被选送到“红大”上级政治科学习。“红大”在松岗成立后不几天，就沿大金川南下至金川县以北的沙尔泥地区；在这里，充实和健全了校领导机构，张际春也调到“红大”，担任政治教员，后任“红大”政治部主任和政治主任教员。我有幸聆听际春同志讲课，后来曾在他的直接领导下工作，他的高贵品德、卓越才能及其在我军政治工作方面的重大建树，给我留下了异常深刻的印象。
    张际春同志调到“红大”工作时，正值红四方面军在张国焘独断专行的指挥下，开始南下。10月5日，部队到达卓木碉地区，张国焘公然成立了所谓“临时中央”和“中央军委”等非法组织，自封为“主席”，其分裂主义活动发展到了登峰造极的地步。际春同志坚持与朱德、刘伯承等同志站在一起，从整个党和红军生死存亡的大局出发，置个人荣辱于度外，积极维护南下部队中一、四方面军指战员之间的团结，使部队在南下失利的情况下，尽可能减少损失。他刚到“红大”就向有关同志了解情况。他从不隐瞒自己的政治观点，按照党的组织原则，恰当地提出自己的意见，与张国焘的分裂行为展开了不懈的斗争。
    在翻越夹金山之前，有不明真相的同志受张国焘的蒙蔽，编了一首将党中央和毛泽东、周恩来等领导红一方面军主力北上抗日的正确行动，污蔑为“向北逃跑”的所谓《红军南下行》的歌子，刘伯承校长听到“红大”有的同志教唱这首歌时，便立即进行了严肃的批评，不准大家唱这种分裂党和红军的歌，并制止其传播。与此同时，际春同志又耐心地向大家摆事实、讲道理，教育同志们正确理解党中央和毛泽东、周恩来等同志率领一部分红军北上抗日是党中央政治局会议的决定，是张国焘事先同意的，也是历史赋予红军的光荣使命。我们要做维护党和红军团结的模范，齐心协力保护人民、打击敌人。
    虽经朱德总司令、刘伯承总参谋长的规劝和部分同志的抵制，但张国焘出尔反尔、一意孤行，并裹协红军部队南下至岷山、天全一带，企图打成都，结果遭强敌所阻，在攻打百丈关的时候，经过七天七夜的鏖战，终不能取胜。这一仗虽然消灭敌人1.5万多人，但红军也伤亡了1万多人。广大指战员在严酷的斗争现实面前，逐步提高了认识，对张国焘南下决策表示不满；特别是党中央一再严肃地批评张国焘南下的错误行为，并敦促他悬崖勒马、改弦更张，致迫使他不得不放弃南下，再度北上。到1936年6月，他才认错，撤销了伪中央。
      当部队在隆冬时节，北风呼啸、大雪纷飞的恶劣环境中，再次翻越夹金山时，同志们唱起了一支歌：“红军向北进呀，要去打日本哪。振作精神服从党中央的命令，向北行动一定要胜利哪。”际春同志听到后，高兴地说：“我们就是需要这样的革命歌子来鼓励大家。”他也与同志们一起高唱起来，并带头将自己的乘马让给有病的同志骑，把分给他的干粮，送给体弱、缺粮的同志吃，乐观地迈着坚定的步伐翻雪山、过草地，去迎接北上抗日的伟大胜利。
    在与张国焘分裂主义活动的斗争中，张际春同志胸怀坦白，光明磊落，刚直不阿，坚持真理，甚至忍辱负重，不计较个人的安危，坚决维护党和红军的团结统一，表现了高度的政治原则性和斗争策略的灵活性。
    （二）
    张际春同志一心为革命，一心为人民，勤勤恳恳谦虚谨慎，朴实细致，埋头苦干，理论联系实际，坚持实事求是，深入群众，调查研究，发扬民主，善于根据实际情况和群众情绪确定工作方针和方法，不愧为发扬党的三大作风的模范。
    他在红军大学的政治课的教学中，把马列主义的原理与当时的斗争实际，即爬雪山，过草地，坚持北上抗日，反对张国焘右倾逃跑主义这个实际结合起来，教学的目的，就是要把在红军大学学习的干部培养成有政治觉悟、有组织指挥作战本领、有教育和管理能力、有艰苦奋斗不怕牺牲精神的带头人。际春同志根据刘伯承校长的旨意，和政治部的同志一起共同研究制定政治课教学计划和实施方案；除坚持马列主义基本原理和中国革命十大纲领教育外，还结合当时实际情况，提出教学内容。
    在组织实施教学过程中，际春同志以他渊博的学识和高深的政治理论基础，把政治课内容讲得深入浅出、生动活泼。他从来不搞空洞的说教，而是针对学员的思想情况和文化程度，循循善诱，通情达理，态度耐心诚恳，语言形象丰富，不时引用一些诙谐幽默的比喻和故事，把道理讲得很透彻。他还结合社会发展史和党的建设两条路线的斗争史（即列宁与马尔托夫关于党的建设问题的论战）等内容，谈古论今，使大家逐步打开了思路、开阔了眼界，思想觉悟不断提高，在艰苦的环境下，通过对实际斗争的认识，进一步认清了张国焘分裂党和红军的严重错误实质，更加坚定不移地维护党中央的正确路线，并增强了一、四方面军指战员之间的团结。
    际春同志与刘伯承校长一样，不仅亲自抓教学计划的组织实施，还经常深入学员中了解教学情况，和同学们一起参加听课、讨论，对学员提出的疑难问题，他都耐心细致地一一回答。他还动员同学们利用业余时间办墙报，如《战火》墙报，坚持每星期出版一次，共出了9期。墙报的内容都是大家学习、生活与思想情况的反映，同学们纷纷写稿，墙报办得生动活泼，很有意义。在红岩坝时，际春同志还创办了“红大”校刊《红炉》，刘伯承校长亲自书写刊头并题词。题词写道：“我们学校就是一个红炉，我们学习军事、政治、文化，以及向一切恶劣的自然环境作斗争，克服一切困难，就要在这个‘红炉’中锻炼。坚强的革命意志就是在通红的炉火中锻炼出来的。”《红炉》校刊一共办了17期，开始为四开张，用油印，以后改为小册子。
    （三）
    1936年1月，“红大”在天全成立了中级干部队，调陈伯迟任队长，下属军事连、政治连。甘延林任军事连连长，我任指导员；皮定钧任政治连连长，黄志勇任指导员。“红大”进驻炉霍后，又继续招收了军、师两级干部400余人组织了第二期高级指挥科、上级指挥科和上级政治科。同时还扩大了步兵学校。当时，连队同校部领导机构共约1500多人，与总部同住炉霍寺庙内。
    1936年6月，贺龙、任弼时、关向应、肖克等同志率领红二、六军团长征到达甘孜，与红四方面军会师后继续北上。7月，中干队学员毕业后，我即被调任“红大”政治部地方工作科任副科长。8月，“红大”随红四方面军总部由炉霍出发，经壤塘喇嘛寺、嘎曲河、堡座等地北上。
    “红大”在炉霍住了5个多月，存粮很少，因此，部队准备过草地的干粮人均每天仅有2两炒面，除边行军边筹粮外，主要靠野菜充饥；我们地方工作科则全力负责群众工作和筹粮的组织与实施。
    在少数民族地区开展群众工作和筹集粮草是一项政策性很强的工作，际春同志多次召集我们学习党的民族政策和宗教政策，认真研究开展群众工作方法和制定筹集粮草的实施方案及注意事项，特别强调尊重少数民族的风俗和生活习惯，并挑选政策观念强的同志组成筹粮队，随部队行军的先头分队行动。筹粮队的指战员克服种种困难，冲破敌人的重重封锁，在人烟稀少的雪山、草地及少数民族地区筹集了一些粮食，补充了部队的部分粮食供给，取得了较大的成绩。
    “双十二”事变后，中央红大随党中央领导机关迁到延安，并改为中国人民抗日军政大学。
    张际春同志作为红军大学的组织者和领导者之一，坚决执行党的教育方针，维护党和红军的团结统一，旗帜鲜明地和朱德总司令、刘伯承总参谋长一起，与张国焘右倾机会主义作斗争，为培养造就大批优秀的红军干部，付出了大量的心血，建立了不朽的功勋。际春同志革命一生的光辉业绩，永远载入我党我军的光荣史册，他的革命精神，正激励着后人为祖国的“四化”建设而努力奋斗！
