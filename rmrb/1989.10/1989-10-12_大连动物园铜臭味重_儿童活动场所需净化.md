During the National Day holiday, the reporter took his daughter to Dalian Zoo and found that some of the amusement projects in this children's paradise were trying to make money from the children, and some projects were even harmful to the children's healthy growth.

A simple tourist carriage pulled six or seven children around the park for a short while, and each child had to pay one yuan for the fare. A kind of electric toy called a rocking animal, a child rides on the back of the animal and rocks for two minutes, and has to pay 50 cents. A child rides on the back of a small horse, led by a person to run about forty or fifty meters in a circle, not even a minute, and one yuan goes into the horse owner's pocket. A seven or eight-year-old boy had already ridden twice and was not satisfied, crying and asking his father to buy "one more ride." His father, while taking out money, said with a bitter smile: "Riding a horse is more expensive than flying, in such a short time, three yuan is gone."

What was most surprising was that some amusement projects with superstitious elements and gambling-like projects had also entered the children's paradise. Around an electronic computer that tells fortunes for children, many parents were gathered. A man spent one yuan to have his son's fortune told, and when he saw the words "harmonious marriage" and "happy marriage" printed on the paper, he angrily said: "This is cheating, my son is only three years old!"

The reporter chatted with the parents. A cadre from an organization said: "The zoo is a place to cultivate children and foster their interests. Such a mess will have what kind of influence on the children?" A teacher worried: "The money-making trend in the zoo not only stimulates children's consumer psychology but also will leave a mark of money worship on the young minds.

### 大连动物园铜臭味重  儿童活动场所需净化

    大连动物园铜臭味重
    儿童活动场所需净化
    据新华社大连10月11日电（记者李小林）国庆节期间，记者带女儿到大连市动物园游玩，发现这个儿童乐园的一些游玩项目是想方设法从孩子身上赚钱，有些项目还有害于儿童的健康成长。
    一辆简易旅游马车拉着六七个孩子在园内走一小会儿，每人要付一元钱的车费。一种叫做摇摆动物的电动玩具，一个孩子骑在动物背上摇摆两分钟，得付5角钱。儿童骑在一匹矮马背上，由人牵着跑大约四五十米的一圈，还不到一分钟，一元钱便进了马主人的腰包。一个七八岁的男孩已经骑了两圈仍未尽兴，哭闹着让爸爸再给买“一圈”，他爸爸边掏钱边苦笑着说：“骑马比坐飞机还贵，这么一会儿，三元钱就没了”。
    最叫人吃惊的是，一些带有迷信色彩的游乐项目和类似赌博的项目也进了儿童乐园。在一台为孩子算命的电子计算机旁，围着许多家长。一名男子花一元钱为儿子算命，当他看到计算机打印出的纸条上写着“夫妻和睦”、“婚姻美满”时，生气地说：“真骗人，我儿子才三岁！”
    记者与家长们攀谈，一位机关干部说：“动物园是陶冶孩子、培养孩子兴趣的地方，这样乱糟糟的，会给孩子带来什么影响？”一位教师忧虑：“动物园里的赚钱之风，不但刺激了儿童的消费心理，还会给幼小的心灵打上向钱看的烙印。
