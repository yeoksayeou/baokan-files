Recently, relevant departments in our county investigated the marriage registration work in some townships and found that early marriage is severe in some places, with some townships having a rate as high as 50%. The youngest age found was 14. Surprisingly, out of the 203 cases of early marriage identified across the county, 189 couples had obtained marriage certificates through legal procedures.

	Officials Substituting Words for Law

Some township and town leaders believe that the marriage law has flexibility, and that age differences do not matter much. Some townships have enacted local regulations that contradict the marriage law. Some people even consider early marriage as a good way to alleviate poverty. In Yueshan Township, out of the 79 young couples found to be under the legal marriage age, 38 couples had their marriages approved by township and town leaders. The Party secretary of Yunshan Township not only arranged the marriage for his underage son but also had relevant personnel issue marriage certificates for three other underage couples. In Miaoya Township, the village head of Gongqiao Village issued marriage certificates for 37 young couples from 1987 to April 1988, of which 28 were under the legal marriage age, with the youngest being only 16 years old. Township and town leaders substituting words for law have disrupted the marriage registration work, leaving marriage registration officials at a loss.

	Low Quality of Marriage Registration Officials

Among the 68 township marriage registration officials in the county, some do not understand the policies, and some are careless in their work.

In Tangshan Village, Baiyang Township, a young woman who was dissatisfied with an arranged marriage was forced by her mother to register for marriage at the township. The registration official even advised her to listen to her mother's words, and she finally took the marriage certificate with tears in her eyes.

The marriage registration official in Yueshan Township, to accommodate a relative, allowed a 14-year-old girl to get married.

The marriage registration official in Shizao Township openly extorted the marriage parties, making the issuance of marriage certificates dependent on gifts. This resulted in 36 young couples in the township getting married early.

The marriage registration official in Pengdian Township, to obtain land for building a house, issued a marriage certificate for the 19-year-old son of the village head of Pengdian Village.

In recent years, some districts and townships have reported inflated marriage registration statistics to higher authorities. Some townships have not yet established marriage archives, and marriage registration books are placed haphazardly. Some have no marriage certificate stubs or numbers. In Wanan Township, 24 marriage certificate stubs are still missing.

	Difficulties in Punishing Early Marriage

Some township and town leaders are reluctant to break up "loving couples," and since many early marriages were approved by township and town leaders, it is difficult for relevant departments to handle them. In Miaoya Township, 77 cases of early marriage were found last year, but no one was punished. Among them, 21 have already had children. The township clerk issued false certificates for 77 early marriages, and to this day, he has not written a single word of self-criticism. In Baiyan Township, a 15-year-old girl in Guanyin Village was forced into marriage with a mentally handicapped person by her mother for the sake of continuing the family line. The mother-in-law even arranged for someone to rape her daughter-in-law. Unable to bear the humiliation, the girl firmly demanded a divorce. The relevant leaders merely scolded the parties involved and let it go.

According to statistics from relevant departments, 60% of the young couples who got married in our county were early marriages. In 1987, 38% of the divorce cases handled by the county people's court involved early marriages. Early marriage also leads to family instability, causing women to leave their homes and making human trafficking rampant in some places.

### 苍溪早婚严重必须坚决制止

    苍溪早婚严重必须坚决制止
    最近，我县有关部门调查了一些乡镇的婚姻登记工作，发现一些地方早婚现象严重，有的乡占50％，年龄最小的14岁。令人惊奇的是，全县已查出的203对早婚中，有189对是按法律程序办理了结婚证的。
          干部以言代法
    一些乡、镇领导干部认为婚姻法有弹性，年龄大点小点没关系。有的乡制定与婚姻法相悖的地方法规，有的人把早婚当作扶贫的好办法。月山乡查出的79对不够法定婚龄的年轻夫妇中，38对属乡、镇领导干部表态办理的，运山乡党委书记不但为不够法定婚龄的儿子操办婚事，还让有关人员给3对不够法定婚龄的青年也办理了结婚证。庙垭乡拱桥村村长1987年至1988年4月为37对青年出具了结婚证明，其中，有28人不够法定婚龄，最小的才16岁。乡、镇领导干部以言代法，干扰了婚姻登记工作，使婚姻登记员无所适从。
        婚姻登记员素质低
    全县68个乡镇的婚姻登记员中，有的不懂政策，有的工作马虎。
    白杨乡塘山村一女青年不满包办婚姻，被母亲逼着到乡里登记结婚，登记员竟规劝她听从母亲的话，直到她含泪领了结婚证。
    月山乡婚姻登记员为照顾亲戚关系，让14岁的少女结了婚。
    石灶乡婚姻登记员公然勒索婚姻当事人，有礼就办结婚证成了他不成文的规定，先后使这个乡36对青年早婚。
    彭店乡婚姻登记员为谋地建房，给彭店村村长19岁的儿子办了结婚证。
    这些年来，有的区、乡向上级报送的婚姻登记情况，大多水份很大。一些乡镇至今没有建立婚姻档案，婚姻登记册乱放，有的无结婚证存根和编号，万安乡有24对结婚证存根至今下落不明。
    早婚问题处罚困难
    有的乡镇领导干部不忍心棒打“鸳鸯”，有的早婚本来就是乡镇领导干部批的，因此，有关部门查处十分困难。庙垭乡去年查出77对青年早婚，但无一人被处理，其中21人已生了孩子。乡文书出具假证明，使77对青年早婚，至今未写只字检讨。白岩乡观音村一名15岁女青年，因母亲包办与一呆傻者成婚。为传宗接代，婆母竟让他人强奸儿媳。这个女青年不堪凌辱，坚决要求离婚，有关领导人仅把几个当事人骂了一通，就完事了。
    据有关部门统计，我县结婚的青年夫妇中，早婚的占60％。县人民法院1987年受理的离婚案中，早婚的占38％。早婚还带来家庭不稳定，造成了一些地方妇女外流和拐卖人口活动猖獗。
