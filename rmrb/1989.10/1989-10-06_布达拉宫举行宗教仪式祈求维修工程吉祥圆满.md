People's Daily, Lhasa, October 6th - From October 1st to 9th, the Potala Palace held three religious ceremonies: reciting 108 volumes of the Kangyur, offering to Tara and chanting Tara's scriptures, and a Vajrayana fire ritual, to pray for the successful completion of the restoration work on this highly symbolic fortress-palace structure.

The reporter saw in the assembly hall of the Potala Palace that more than 60 monks from Sera Monastery, Drepung Monastery, and the Potala Palace, under the guidance of Sera Monastery's senior monk Yeshe Wangchuk, were reciting the Kangyur scriptures. The head of the Buddhist affairs group for the Potala Palace restoration project, Moya Quji Jianlin, explained that according to Tibetan traditional ceremonies, restoring the sacred Potala Palace requires Buddhist activities. The recitation of 108 volumes of the Kangyur from October 1st to 4th is the most solemn and dignified ceremony.

It is understood that such a large-scale religious ceremony has not been held in the Potala Palace for 30 years.
