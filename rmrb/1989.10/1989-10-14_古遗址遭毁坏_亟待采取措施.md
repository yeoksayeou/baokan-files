Ancient Sites Destroyed – Urgent Measures Needed

The Sanjiang Plain currently has over 300 ancient fortresses and castle ruins from the Bronze Age and the Liao and Jin dynasties. Among them, the well-preserved Qian Dongjia Mountain Fortress has been designated as a national-level cultural relic protection unit, and eleven sites, including the Five Nations City from the Liao and Jin dynasties, have been designated as provincial-level cultural relic protection units. However, many ancient cities have been repeatedly destroyed. The area designated as the cultural relic protection zone for the city known as Wuguo Tou Cheng in Yilan County now has 28 residential houses built within it. Part of the city area of the Wali Hutun Ancient City, one of the Five Nations Cities from the Liao and Jin dynasties in Huachuan County, has been cultivated by farmers for farming. The soil from the northwest section of the city wall has been used by some people to make bricks, and some sections of the southern city wall have been demolished by bulldozers. The ancient city is now riddled with holes.

    古遗址遭毁坏  亟待采取措施
    三江平原现有青铜时代、辽金时代的古山寨、城堡遗址三百多处，其中保存完好的前董家山寨已被批准为国家级文物保护单位，辽金时代五国城等十一处被批准为省级文物保护单位。然而，不少古城却屡屡遭到破坏。被称五国头城的依兰县文物保护范围地，如今建起了二十八处民房。辽金时代五国城之一的桦川县瓦里霍吞古城，部分城区被农民开荒种地，西北段护城墙的土被有些人用来烧砖，南侧城垣一些地段被掘土机推倒了，古城已是百孔千疮。
