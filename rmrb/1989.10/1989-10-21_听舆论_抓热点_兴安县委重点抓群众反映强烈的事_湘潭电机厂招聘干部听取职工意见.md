Xing'an County Committee Focuses on Issues with Strong Public Concern

	Broadcaster: Zhang Yonggang, Office of the Xing'an County Committee, Guangxi

	Since this year, the Xing'an County Committee in Guangxi has focused on issues that have received numerous complaints and strong public concern, conducting practical work on building a clean government.

	The issue of "red envelopes." Within a month, the county has basically clarified the situation: 9,900 yuan in "red envelopes" received by leading cadres have been returned, with 7,500 yuan already retrieved and the rest to be returned in batches.

	The issue of cadres and staff embezzling public funds is a long-standing problem. The county has clearly stipulated that financial personnel in all units must conduct a comprehensive audit of the embezzlement of public funds by cadres and staff in their units and report the situation truthfully. The audit department will conduct focused inspections based on the situation. For those who refuse to return the funds, their salaries will be withheld or their property will be seized to cover the debt. Serious cases will be subject to disciplinary action. By early July, out of the 910,000 yuan embezzled across the county, 340,000 yuan has been returned.

	The issue of leading cadres abusing power, embezzling, and accepting bribes, causing a loss of over 2 million yuan for Xing'an County last year. The County Committee has decided to focus on this issue. By the end of June, the county has investigated and handled 12 cases of dereliction of duty, embezzlement, and bribery.

Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory Listens to Workers' Opinions on Recruiting Cadres

	Broadcaster: Zhou Zhizhou, Chen Wen, Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory, Hunan

	Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory needs to recruit a batch of cadres. Workers throughout the factory strongly demand that the personnel department be fair and honest, and block any improper practices. The factory's personnel department, based on public feedback, decided to recruit openly: the recruitment notice is open, the selection method is open, the examination scope is open, the assessment content is open, individual scores are open, the list of selected candidates is open, and the probation situation is open.

	The assessment and probation processes, which have more flexibility and are harder to control, are of particular concern to the public. In the past, evaluating a person's merits and abilities often relied on the impressions of leaders. After the assessment process was opened up, the personnel department paid attention to evaluating from multiple aspects such as interpersonal relationships, work performance, labor discipline, and completion of work hours; for the probation situation, the cadre recruitment group gathered opinions from relevant responsible persons and the public from multiple angles, achieving good results. Out of the 63 cadres recruited throughout the factory, not a single one was recruited in violation of regulations.

　　听舆论　抓热点
　　兴安县委重点抓群众反映强烈的事
　　湘潭电机厂招聘干部听取职工意见
    广西兴安县委办公室　张永刚来信：今年以来，广西兴安县委从群众意见多、反映强烈的问题入手，扎扎实实地开展廉政建设。
      “红包”问题。县里不到一个月就基本弄清了：领导干部收受的9900元“红包”，现已退出了7500元，剩余的分批退出。
    干部职工挪欠公款是老大难问题。县里明确规定各单位的财务人员全面清理本单位干部职工挪欠公款情况，如实上报，审计部门根据情况重点清查，对抵赖不还的，扣发工资或拿家产抵交，严重的给予党纪、政纪处分。到7月初，全县挪欠的91万多元公款，已经清退了34万多元。
    领导干部弄权渎职、贪污、受贿，使兴安县去年损失200多万元问题。县委决定把这一问题作为重点来抓，到6月底止，全县共立案查处12件渎职、贪污、受贿案。
    湖南湘潭电机厂　周治洲　陈文来信：湘潭电机厂需要招聘一批干部，全厂职工强烈要求人事部门廉洁公正，堵住不正之风。厂人事处根据群众反应，决定公开招聘：招聘消息公开、录取方法公开、考试范围公开、考察内容公开、个人成绩公开、录取名单公开、试聘情况公开。
    考察公开，试聘公开是弹性较大难以把握的项目，群众尤为关心。因为过去评价一个人的好坏、能力如何，往往凭领导人的印象。考察公开后，人事处注意从群众关系、工作成绩、劳动纪律、完成工时等多方面考察；对试聘情况，干部招聘小组向有关负责人和群众多方面了解，收到较好效果。全厂招聘的63名干部，没有一个是违反规定被招聘的。
