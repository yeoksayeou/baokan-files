The economic situation is a matter of widespread concern. The report from the State Statistical Bureau provides a convincing analysis, highlighting both the achievements of the rectification efforts and the new challenges faced, and offering specific suggestions for further rectification and deepening of reforms. The report's emphasis on "continuing to control the total amount and promoting structural adjustment" is particularly noteworthy.

From the first to the third quarter of this year, the work of rectifying and reorganizing the national economy has been further advanced. Effective supply continues to grow, the structure has improved somewhat, social demand has been initially controlled, currency has been effectively recalled, the rate of price increases has gradually decreased, and the contradiction between supply and demand in society has eased. The overall economy is turning in a positive direction. However, the imbalance between total supply and demand in society caused by the overheating of the economy in previous years has not been broken, structural contradictions still exist, and as the rectification work deepens, some latent contradictions in economic life are gradually emerging. New problems are arising as we move forward.

The Achievements of Rectification and Reorganization

These are mainly reflected in the "one continuous growth," "four initial controls," and "one significant change" in the operation of the national economy.

"One Continuous Growth":

The national economy continues to grow. Preliminary calculations show that from January to September, the Gross National Product, calculated at comparable prices, increased by 5% compared to the same period last year. From an agricultural production perspective, although some regions experienced severe natural disasters, this year's summer harvest reached a historical high, and early rice had a bumper harvest. The combined summer harvest and early rice increased by 351 million tons compared to last year. By the end of September, the state had purchased 495 million tons of grain, an increase of 495 million tons compared to the same period last year; of which, contract purchases increased by 327 million tons. The sowing area for autumn grain has expanded, and except for the Northeast and parts of North China, which will see reduced yields due to severe disasters, other major producing areas are expected to see increased yields. Meat production has maintained a growth trend. Aquatic products, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and silkworm cocoons have all performed better than last year. From an industrial production perspective, from January to September, the total industrial output value of the country was 961.7 billion yuan, an increase of 8.9% compared to the same period last year, a decrease of 8.6 percentage points in the growth rate compared to the same period last year. Of this, the total industrial output value of state-owned enterprises was 599.5 billion yuan, an increase of 5.2%; the total industrial output value of collective-owned enterprises was 321.3 billion yuan, an increase of 12.5% (the total industrial output value of township enterprises was 144.1 billion yuan, an increase of 17.4%).

"Four Initial Controls":

Fixed asset investment has been initially controlled. First, after cleaning up, the country has stopped or slowed down more than 18,000 fixed asset investment projects, which can save 67.5 billion yuan in future investments; second, new projects have significantly decreased, and from January to September, state-owned basic construction and renovation projects with investments of more than 50,000 yuan have decreased by two-thirds compared to the same period last year; third, investment compression has made progress, and from January to September, state-owned unit fixed asset investments totaled 126.1 billion yuan, a decrease of 9.7 billion yuan compared to the same period last year, a compression of 7.2%. Of this, basic construction investment was 77.4 billion yuan, a decrease of 5.2%; renovation investment was 34.9 billion yuan, a decrease of 17%. If price factors are considered, the actual work volume compression exceeds 20%, which has not occurred since 1982. The investment structure has improved. From January to September, energy industry investments totaled 33.6 billion yuan, and despite the overall compression, they still increased by 5.3%, with their share rising from 23.5% in the same period last year to 26.7%. The share of investments in raw materials, transportation, agriculture, education, and culture has increased. The construction of buildings and facilities has been effectively controlled, with 2,500 projects stopped or slowed down, which can save 26 billion yuan in future investments. However, this is still far from the planned requirements.

Consumer demand growth has been initially controlled. From January to September, the total wage bill for workers nationwide was 178.4 billion yuan, an increase of 18.2% compared to the same period last year. Of this, bonus payments totaled 31.4 billion yuan, an increase of 26.7% compared to the same period last year, a decrease of 19.9 percentage points in the growth rate compared to the same period last year. Bank payments for wages of township enterprises totaled 12.5 billion yuan, an increase of 11.3%, a decrease of 22.4 percentage points in the growth rate compared to the same period last year. Social collective consumption of consumer goods totaled 52.1 billion yuan, an increase of only 6.2% compared to the same period last year. The above consumption demand, after deducting price factors, shows negative growth. The supply-demand gap in the retail market for the whole year is expected to decrease from 80 billion yuan last year to around 40 billion yuan.

Bank loans have been initially controlled, and cash inflows and outflows have significantly improved. Due to the vigorous promotion of savings, strict control of credit, and currency issuance, by the end of September, the loan-deposit difference of credit cooperatives had decreased by 29.8 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year. As of the end of September, banks had recalled 5.16 billion yuan in net currency, while the same period last year saw a net issuance of 39.6 billion yuan.

The rate of price increases has gradually decreased, and the trend of inflation has been initially controlled. From January to September, the overall retail price level is expected to increase by 22.3% compared to the same period last year. Of this, the increase in April was 25.8%, in May 24.3%, in June 21.5%, in July 19%, in August 15.2%, and in September around 13%. The main features of market price changes this year are: (1) Few new price increases. From January to September, the new price increase component in the national retail price index was only 7.6 percentage points, significantly lower than the same period last year. (2) The price index for basic living expenses in urban areas has decreased significantly, from 26.2% in January to 8% in August. (3) The price of subsidiary food products has remained basically stable at the level of December last year.

"One Significant Change":

The domestic market is relatively stable, with a shift from consumers' "panic buying" to commercial departments' "discount sales," and market order has improved, with fewer counterfeit and shoddy goods, price gouging, and reselling. From January to September, the total retail sales of social commodities were 607.3 billion yuan, an increase of 12.3% compared to the same period last year. After deducting the price increase factor, the actual decrease was 8.2%, which has not occurred in the past ten years.

Views on Several Issues in the Current Economic Life

The economic operation trajectory of the first nine months indicates that, from a macro perspective, the rectification and reorganization work has achieved stage results, and the development trend is basically reasonable and moving in the predetermined direction. However, some new situations and problems have emerged, attracting attention from all sides.

First, the industrial growth rate has sharply declined. Since the third quarter, the industrial growth rate has gradually slowed down. Compared to the same period last year, the growth rate in July was 9.6%, in August 6.1%, and in September only 0.9%, the lowest monthly growth rate in the past ten years. It is estimated that industrial production will continue to grow slowly in the fourth quarter. The reasons for this change are multifaceted, including both economic and non-economic factors. From an economic perspective, first, measures to compress investments and control consumption are gradually taking effect, reducing the pressure on the market for industry, reflected in the stagnation of investment-type products and high-end consumer goods in processing industries, controlled production, and a significant cooling of township enterprise production. Second, the rapid growth of industry in previous years has caused serious imbalances in the ratio of agriculture to industry and within the industry, with bottlenecks in basic industries gradually strengthening, and production relying on agricultural and sideline products significantly slowing down. Power shortages, coal shortages, and material shortages have caused production difficulties in some regions, leading to insufficient capacity utilization. Third, there is a shortage of funds, enterprises face operational difficulties, and mutual debt arrears exceed 1,000 billion yuan, affecting the normal and reasonable allocation of production factors, which will inevitably constrain production development. From a non-economic perspective, the main issue is that some grassroots enterprises have misunderstandings about policies and have doubts. Factory managers lack enthusiasm for organizing production, procurement personnel are reluctant to go out, and the phenomenon of "waiting for policies and methods" is increasing, with subjective initiative not being fully utilized, which is also an important reason for the sharp decline in industrial production in September. Overall, the decline in industrial growth rate in recent months is based on the super-high growth rate of industry in the same period last year. The average growth rate is still not low, and the industrial production level is relatively high. The average daily output in September increased by 5.6% compared to the previous month. Especially in the process of slowing down, the industrial structure is improving, and the production of energy, electricity, raw materials, and agricultural support products is steadily increasing. Therefore, it is basically normal, and it is a necessary result of the effectiveness of various rectification and reorganization measures. It is important to fully recognize the cooling of industrial production, which provides an opportunity to adjust the structure and improve enterprise quality. Of course, it is also necessary to prevent and correct the impact of various non-economic factors on production and maintain the reasonable growth of industrial production.

Second, market sales are sluggish. Since the summer, despite the nationwide trend of discount sales with price reductions of 5-30%, consumer enthusiasm remains low, and the domestic market shows a monthly sluggish trend. The total retail sales of social commodities compared to the same period last year were up 7% in July, down 0.7% in August, and down 1.1% in September. After deducting price changes, the actual decline is even greater. Most commodities have seen a decline in sales volume, which has not occurred in the past ten years. The reasons for the sluggish market sales are: first, the increase in deposit interest rates, the implementation of savings, social fundraising, and bond issuance have converted some purchasing power, and with the market supply being relatively good this year, the public has shifted from "purchasing for preservation" to "savings for preservation," and impulsive purchasing behavior has significantly decreased. From January to September, the net increase in urban and rural residents' savings deposits was 100 billion yuan, an increase of 52.4 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. Second, the delayed effect of the public's over-purchasing last year is beginning to emerge. For example, last year's hot-selling items such as color TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, cotton cloth, woolen fabrics, soap, and detergent have seen a decline in market sales of 10-40% from January to September this year compared to the same period last year. Third, the improvement in clean governance has improved social ethics, and phenomena such as public-funded travel, dining, and the indiscriminate distribution of money and goods have decreased. Fourth, some commodities have seen excessive price increases, poor product quality, and unsuitable varieties, which have also suppressed some consumption. Additionally, facing the price drop of some commodities, residents' consumption psychology has changed, and the tendency to hold cash and wait has increased. We must see that the current market sluggishness is a necessary reaction to the effectiveness of rectification and reorganization measures, a result of changing the abnormal overheated consumption, and the emergence of a buyer's market for some commodities, which is beneficial for structural adjustment. However, we must also see that the sluggish market sales have brought some negative impacts on economic development. First, commercial and industrial inventories have both seen overstocking, and if calculated based on the average growth rate from 1984 to 1988, the current inventory overstocking of commercial and industrial enterprises is around 50 billion yuan. Most of the newly increased working capital of industrial enterprises is pressed in the warehouse, which is also an important reason for the current shortage of funds. Second, it affects the recall of commodity currency by banks, causing the potential consumption demand to further increase the pressure on the market. From January to September, the commodity recall by banks increased by 29.3 billion yuan compared to the same period last year, an increase of only 7.6%, accounting for only 15% of the total increase in cash income; while the credit recall increased by 121.5 billion yuan, an increase of 39.6%, accounting for a high proportion of 62%. If this situation continues, it will not be conducive to economic stability.

Third, enterprise economic benefits have declined. From January to September, the realized profits and taxes of state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget were only 1.8% higher than the same period last year (of which realized profits decreased by 16.2%); the loss amount of loss-making enterprises had already exceeded the full-year level of last year by the end of the first half of the year, with a cumulative loss of 9.8 billion yuan by the end of September, an increase of 1.2 times; the cost overrun of comparable products was 20.1%; enterprises owed 7.69 billion yuan in taxes and profits, an increase of 3.05 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. The economic benefits of commercial enterprises are not high, profits have decreased, and costs have increased. The operating profits of state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperative enterprises have decreased by 35% compared to the same period last year, and the sales costs per 100 yuan of goods have increased by 2%. The main reasons for the decline in benefits are: first, due to the impact of sluggish production and investment compression, the speed and scale benefits of enterprises have decreased; second, due to the impact of rectifying the circulation order and controlling price increases, the unreasonable price increase benefits of enterprises have decreased; third, due to the impact of external arbitrary levies, arbitrary charges, and arbitrary price increases, some benefits of enterprises have been lost; fourth, due to the impact of relaxed management, the operating benefits of enterprises have decreased.

Fourth, the imbalance in fiscal and foreign exchange receipts and expenditures has intensified. Due to the dual impact of the decline in enterprise economic benefits and the increase in price subsidies, the factors of reduced revenue and increased expenditure in the fiscal budget have increased this year, making the completion of the annual budget task arduous.

Due to the insufficient export supply, difficulties in fund turnover, and the impact of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in May and June, the trade deficit has expanded this year, and the income from non-trade foreign exchange is not ideal, making the imbalance in foreign exchange receipts and expenditures more severe. From January to September, the total value of imports and exports through customs was 78.9 billion US dollars, an increase of 14.3% compared to the same period last year. Of this, exports totaled 36.2 billion US dollars, an increase of 10.6%; imports totaled 42.7 billion US dollars, an increase of 17.7%. After deducting projects such as processing with supplied materials, equipment imported by foreigners as investment, and free donations that do not involve foreign exchange settlement, imports exceeded exports by 3.9 billion US dollars. As of mid-September, the surplus in non-trade foreign exchange receipts and expenditures was 2.17 billion US dollars.

In addition, agricultural production, especially crop production, has not yet escaped the stalemate. As the rectification and reorganization work deepens, employment pressure will also become prominent.

The emergence of the above problems has increased the pressure and difficulty of future economic work on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is the exposure of contradictions accumulated over the past few years and is inevitable in the process of tightening. It is a stage effect of the rectification and reorganization work. On the other hand, it provides an opportunity for economic rectification. The current economic rectification work has entered a critical stage of controlling the total amount, adjusting the structure, and improving benefits. How to get through this period will have an important impact on the overall effect of the rectification and reorganization work and the future development of the national economy.

Seize the Opportunity, Continue to Control the Total Amount, and Promote Structural Adjustment

We believe that in the next period, while adhering to the premise of total amount tightening, we should further rectify and reorganize, improve the scientificity and effectiveness of actual operations, and seize the opportunity to shift the focus of economic work to adjusting the economic structure, strengthening management, and improving enterprise economic benefits.

First, unify thinking, improve awareness, and adhere to macro tightening. The control of demand has achieved some results this year, but this has only temporarily alleviated the supply-demand contradiction of the current year and has not fundamentally solved the historical legacy problems. The task of total amount tightening is still quite arduous, and we must fully recognize the long-term and arduous nature of the rectification and reorganization work. The achievements of the previous period of rectification and reorganization are hard-won, and we must adhere to the total amount tightening to prevent "halfway abandonment." Continue to do a good job in controlling bank credit and fiscal expenditures, and the loan issuance in the fourth quarter should be moderate and not too aggressive. The direction should be reasonable, and adhere to the use of total amount tightening to promote structural adjustment. At the same time, continue to promote clean governance, and all levels of party and government organs and leaders should take the lead in clean governance, lead the way in living a few years of tight times, further improve social ethics, and invigorate the national spirit.

Second, recognize the seriousness of the five-year stagnation in agriculture, and make great efforts to further improve agricultural production. In the short term, focus on doing a good job in the procurement of agricultural products and autumn-winter sowing, ensure the procurement funds, and resolutely not issue "white receipts" to ensure the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and activate the rural market. Continue to mobilize all forces to increase agricultural investment, and make great efforts to improve agricultural water conservancy construction this winter and next spring, improve drought resistance and flood control capabilities, further improve agricultural production conditions, and strive for a bumper harvest next year.

Third, appropriately tilt, balance pressure and support, and strive for reasonable growth in industrial production. Fully play the leading role of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, according to the requirements of the national industrial policy, adopt various forms, and concentrate a part of funds, materials, transportation, etc. to support key enterprises in energy, important raw materials, agricultural support products, export products, and suitable light textile products in a targeted and step-by-step manner to improve production and operation. At the same time, further clarify the relevant economic policy boundaries, give full play to the enthusiasm of enterprise operators and employees, and promote the transformation from "eyes outward" to "eyes inward," do a good job in internal potential tapping, adjust the structure, increase varieties, improve quality, reduce consumption, improve services.

Fourth, improve management, control and adjust, and effectively improve the investment structure. On the one hand, strengthen the planning management of investments, appropriately concentrate the approval authority, and do a good job in the supervision of projects that have been decided to stop or slow down, new projects, and ongoing projects, strictly enforce discipline, and correct any violations. On the other hand, differentiate treatment and strengthen the adjustment of the investment structure. First, concentrate a part of the funds to do a good job in the construction of key projects, especially agricultural, coal, electricity, transportation, and important raw material projects, clear up the arrears of engineering funds, ensure the reasonable progress of key construction projects, and maintain the momentum of national economic development. Second, appropriately increase the renovation and transformation investment of large and medium-sized backbone enterprises for product updates and quality improvements, and accelerate the adjustment of enterprise production structure. Third, further compress general processing industries and the construction of buildings and facilities. Fourth, strengthen the management of municipal construction and commercial housing investments. In recent years, the continuous expansion of county-to-city and city-upgrading has led to a large-scale expansion of municipal construction. During the adjustment period, the approval of new cities should be temporarily suspended. The construction of commercial housing should be strengthened in the future.

Fifth, strengthen commercial cooperation, actively guide, and improve market sales work. Currently, the market is sluggish, and except for a few long-term commodities, most commodities are only relatively surplus, and the potential pressure on the market is still increasing, and the contradiction between supply and demand in the entire market has not been eliminated. Therefore, on the one hand, the state should actively help to straighten out the relationship between industry and commerce, differentiate treatment, and activate production and sales. It is suggested to appropriately raise a part of the special funds, and provide interest-free loans to support state-owned commercial enterprises in purchasing commodities necessary for people's livelihood and beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, as state reserves, to play the role of the "reservoir" of state-owned commerce, which can not only ensure the supply next year but also promote production and increase benefits. On the other hand, flexible measures should be taken to unblock channels and reasonably guide residents' consumption.

Sixth, rectify the order, strengthen supervision, and strictly control market price increases. Although the retail price increase rate in the market has gradually decreased this year, the overall price level is still high, and the decrease in the price increase rate is mainly achieved through strengthening administrative intervention and increasing fiscal subsidies. The potential price increase pressure is still relatively large, and if relaxed, it may lead to a new round of price increases, affecting market stability. At the same time, the chaotic situation in the market has not been fundamentally rectified, and illegal phenomena are still common. Therefore, continue to place the rectification of the circulation order in an important position, gradually restore the normal economic order, and promote the normal development of business activities. Continue to strictly control price management authority, and prices cannot be raised arbitrarily without approval. In the process of controlling prices, seize the opportunity to effectively straighten out some unreasonable price relationships.

Seventh, create conditions, increase exports, and vigorously compress imports. Efforts should be made to increase export resources, and while improving the foreign trade system, actively adjust the quality, grade, and variety structure of export products, and strive to open up new markets. At the same time, strengthen the work of replacing imported goods, compress the import of high-end consumer goods and general products, and save foreign exchange. Further improve the work of external publicity, improve the use of foreign investment, tourism, international aid, and other non-trade income, and alleviate the foreign exchange tension.

　　治理整顿初见成效  面临形势依然严峻
　　——一至三季度国民经济发展简析
    编者按：经济形势如何，这是人们普遍关心的问题。国家统计局的这份报告对此作了有说服力的分析，既指出了整治的成效，又讲明了新的困难，并且为进一步治理整顿、深化改革提出了具体建议，报告中提出的“继续控制总量，推动结构调整”，尤其值得重视。
    今年1至3季度，国民经济治理整顿工作进一步开展，有效供给继续增长，结构有所改善，社会需求得到初步控制，货币回笼较好，物价涨幅逐月回落，社会供求矛盾有所缓解，整个经济正朝好的方向转变。但前几年经济过热造成的社会总供求不平衡格局仍未打破，结构性矛盾依然存在，随着治整工作的深入，经济生活中的一些潜伏矛盾逐渐显露，前进中又出现一些新的问题。
    治理整顿的成效
    主要表现为国民经济运行中出现的“一个继续增长”、“四个初步控制”和“一个明显变化”。
    “一个继续增长”：
    ——国民经济继续增长。初步测算，1至9月国民生产总值按可比价格计算，比去年同期增长5％。从农业生产看，尽管局部地区出现了严重的自然灾害，但今年夏粮创历史最高水平，早稻喜获丰收，夏粮、早稻合计比去年增产351万吨。按生产年度计算，到9月末，国家已收购粮食比去年同期增加495万吨；其中合同收购增加327万吨。秋粮播种面积扩大，除东北三省和华北部分地区因灾情严重将减产外，其他主产区大都可望增产。肉类生产保持增长势头。水产品、鲜菜、鲜果、蚕茧生产普遍好于去年。从工业生产看，1至9月，全国工业总产值9617亿元，比去年同期增长8.9％，比去年同期的增幅回落8.6个百分点。其中，全民所有制工业5995亿元，增长5.2％；集体所有制工业3213亿元，增长12.5％（乡办工业1441亿元，增长17.4％）。
    “四个初步控制”：
    ——固定资产投资得到初步控制。一是经过清理，全国已停缓建固定资产投资项目1.8万多个，可压缩今后投资675亿元；二是新开工项目明显减少，1至9月，全民所有制基本建设和更新改造新开工5万元以上的建设项目一万多个，比去年同期减少2／3；三是压缩投资取得进展，1至9月，全民所有制单位固定资产投资1261亿元，比去年同期减少97亿元，压缩7.2％。其中基本建设投资774亿元，下降5.2％；更新改造投资349亿元，下降17％。如果考虑价格因素，实际工作量压缩达20％以上，是1982年以来所没有的。投资结构有所改善。1至9月，能源工业投资336亿元，在总的压缩环境中仍增长5.3％，所占比重由去年同期的23.5％上升到26.7％。原材料、交通、农业、文教等部门投资比重有所上升。楼堂馆所建设得到有效控制，已有2500个项目停缓建，可压缩今后投资260亿元。但与计划的要求仍相距甚远。
    ——消费需求增长得到初步控制。1至9月，全国职工工资总额1784亿元，比去年同期增长18.2％。其中奖金支出314亿元，比去年同期增长26.7％，比去年同期的增幅下降19.9个百分点。银行对乡镇企事业工资性支出125亿元，增长11.3％，比去年同期的增幅下降22.4个百分点。社会集团消费品购买521亿元，仅比去年同期增长6.2％。上述消费需求，如扣除物价因素均为负增长。全年零售市场商品供需差额将由去年的800亿元缩到400亿元左右。
    ——银行贷款得到初步控制，现金收支明显好转。由于大力开展保值储蓄、严格控制信贷和货币投放，9月末银行信用社存贷差比年初缩小298亿元。截至9月末，银行净回笼货币51.6亿元，而去年同期为净投放396亿元。
    ——物价涨幅逐月回落，通货膨胀势头得到初步控制。1至9月预计，全国零售物价总水平比去年同期上升22.3％。其中4月上升25.8％，5月上升24.3％，6月上升21.5％，7月上升19％，8月上升15.2％，9月上升13％左右。今年以来市场物价变动的主要特点是：（1）新涨价因素较少。1至9月，全国零售物价指数中，新涨价部分仅7.6个百分点，大大低于去年同期水平。（2）城镇基本生活费用价格指数涨幅回落大，由1月份的26.2％回落到8月份的8％。（3）副食品价格基本稳定在去年12月水平。
    “一个明显变化”：
    ——国内市场比较平稳，由过去消费者“抢购”转变为工商部门“让利推销”，市场秩序有所好转，伪劣商品、乱涨价和倒买倒卖现象减少。1至9月，社会商品零售总额6073亿元，比去年同期增长12.3％，扣除物价上涨因素，实际下降8.2％，这是近十年从未有过的。
  对当前经济生活中若干问题的看法
    前九个月经济运行轨迹表明，从宏观上看，治理整顿工作取得了阶段性成果，发展态势基本是合理的，正朝着预定方向前进。但是，也出现了一些新情况、新问题，引起了各方面的关注。
    一、工业速度陡落。进入第三季度以来，工业增长速度逐月放慢，与去年同期相比，7月增长9.6％，8月增长6.1％，9月仅增长0.9％，是近十年来同期增幅最低的一个月。预计第四季度工业生产仍将缓慢增长。出现这一变化，原因是多方面的，既有经济因素，也有非经济因素。从经济因素看，首先是压缩投资、控制消费等措施逐渐见效，减轻了市场对工业的压力，表现在加工工业中的投资类产品和高档消费品出现滞销，生产有所控制，乡镇企业生产也明显降温。其次是前几年工业过快增长造成工农业比例和工业内部结构严重失调，基础产业的瓶颈制约逐渐增强，以农副产品为原料的生产明显减慢，缺电、缺煤、缺原材料造成一些地区生产难以正常组织，开工不足。再次是资金紧张，企业周转困难，相互债务拖欠逾千亿元，影响生产要素的正常合理配置，势必制约生产发展。从非经济因素看，主要是目前一些基层企业对政策理解有偏差，存在疑虑。厂长们组织生产积极性不高，采购人员不愿外出，“等政策、等办法”现象增多，主观能动性没有得到充分发挥，这也是9月份工业生产陡降的重要原因。综合起来看，近几个月工业速度的跌落是建立在去年同期工业超高速的基础上，平均速度还不低，工业生产水平也比较高，9月平均日产值比上月还增长5.6％。特别是在速度回落过程中，产业结构趋向好转，能源、电力、原材料、支农产品生产增幅稳步回升，因而是基本正常的，它是各项治理整顿措施见效的必然结果。要充分看到工业生产的降温，为调整结构和提高企业素质提供了契机。当然，也要防止和纠正各种非经济因素对生产的影响，保持工业生产的合理增长。
    二、市场销售疲软。入夏以来，尽管让利销售风席卷全国，价格优惠5—30％，但消费者购买热情依然不高，国内市场呈现逐月疲软态势。社会商品零售总额和去年同期相比，7月增长7％，8月下降0.7％，9月下降1.1％，扣除物价变动因素，实际下降幅度更大。大多数商品销量都呈下降趋势，这是近十年从未有过的。市场销售疲软的原因：一是提高存款利率、实行保值储蓄、社会集资和发行债券等转化了一部分购买力，加之今年市场供应较好，群众由“购物保值”转为“储蓄保值”，冲动性购买行为明显减少。1至9月，城乡居民储蓄存款净增1000亿元，比去年同期多增524亿元。二是去年群众超前超量抢购对市场的滞后效应开始显露。如彩电、冰箱、洗衣机、棉布、呢绒、肥皂、洗衣粉等去年的抢购热门货，今年1至9月市场销量比去年同期分别下降10—40％。三是廉政建设改善了社会风气，公费旅游、吃喝及乱发钱物现象减少。四是部分商品价格上涨过高，产品质量不好，品种不对路，也抑制了一些消费。另外，面对部分商品价格的回落，居民消费心理有所变化，持币观望增多。我们既要看到目前市场疲软是治理整顿措施见效的必然反应，是改变不正常的过旺消费的结果，部分商品的买方市场出现，有利促进结构调整。但也应看到，市场销售疲软给经济发展带来一些消极影响。首先是商业库存和工业库存都出现超储积压现象，如果按照1984—1988年平均增幅匡算，目前工商企业库存超储500亿元左右，工业企业新增流动资金大多数压在仓库，这也是造成资金紧张的一个重要原因。其次是影响银行商品性货币回笼，造成潜在消费需求对市场的压力进一步增大。1至9月，银行商品性回笼比去年同期增加293亿元，仅增长7.6％，占全部现金收入增量的比重只有15％；而同期信用回笼增加1215亿元，增长39.6％，所占比重高达62％。这种格局长此下去，是不利于经济稳定的。
    三、企业经济效益下降。1至9月，预算内国营工业企业实现利税仅比去年同期增长1.8％（其中实现利润下降16.2％）；亏损企业亏损额到上半年已超过去年全年水平，9月末累计98亿元，增长1.2倍；可比产品成本超支20.1％；企业拖欠税利达76.9亿元，比去年同期增加30.5亿元。商业企业经济效益不高，利润下降，费用提高。国营商业和供销合作社企业经营利润比去年同期下降35％，百元商品销售费用提高2％。效益下降的主要原因，一是受生产不景气和压缩投资的影响，企业的速度和规模型效益减少；二是受整顿流通秩序，控制物价上涨的影响，企业的不合理的涨价型效益有所减少；三是受外部乱摊派、乱收费、乱加价影响，企业的一些效益流失了；四是受经营管理放松的影响，企业的经营型效益有所下降。
    四、财政、外汇收支不平衡矛盾加剧。受企业经济效益下降和物价补贴增加的双重影响，今年财政减收增支因素增多，完成全年预算任务艰巨。
    受出口货源不足、资金周转困难和5、6月间动乱和反革命暴乱影响，今年外贸逆差扩大，非贸易外汇收入不理想，全年外汇收支不平衡矛盾加剧。1至9月，海关进出口总值789亿美元，比去年同期增长14.3％。其中出口362亿美元，增长10.6％；进口427亿美元，增长17.7％。扣除来料加工、外商作为投资进口的设备和无偿赠送等不收付外汇的项目，进大于出39亿美元。到9月中旬止，非贸易现汇收支顺差额21.7亿美元。
    此外，农业生产特别是种植业生产仍然没有摆脱徘徊局面。随着治理整顿工作的深入，劳动就业的压力也将趋向突出。
    上述问题的出现，一方面增加了今后经济工作的压力和难度，是过去几年积累起来矛盾的暴露，也是紧缩过程中不可避免的，是治理整顿工作的一种阶段性效应。另一方面，又给经济治理提供了机遇。目前经济治整工作已进入了总量控制下的调整结构和提高效益的关键阶段，如何渡过这个时期，对整个治理整顿工作效果和今后国民经济的发展有重要影响。
    抓住有利时机，继续控制总量，推进结构调整
    我们认为，今后一段时期，应在坚持总量紧缩的前提下，进一步治理整顿，提高实际操作的科学性和有效性，切实把握时机，将经济工作的重点转到调整经济结构，加强管理，提高企业经济效益上来。
    一、统一思想，提高认识，坚持宏观紧缩。今年以来控制需求取得一定成效，但这仅仅是初步缓解了当年的供求矛盾，并没有根本解决历史遗留问题，总量紧缩任务仍相当艰巨，要充分认识治整工作的长期性和艰巨性。前一时期治理整顿取得的成效来之不易，要坚持总量紧缩，防止“半途而废”。继续做好银行信贷、财政支出的控制工作，第四季度贷款投放要适度，不宜过猛，投向要合理，坚持以总量紧缩促结构调整。与此同时，要继续开展廉政建设，各级党政机关及领导人要做廉政建设的表率，带头过几年紧日子，进一步改善社会风气，振奋民族精神。
    二、要认识农业连续五年徘徊的严重性，花大力气，进一步抓好农业生产。近期要重点做好农产品收购和秋冬播工作，落实收购资金，坚决不打“白条”，以保证农副产品收购，活跃农村市场。继续动员各方面力量，增加农业投入，大力搞好今冬明春的农田水利建设，提高抗旱防涝能力，进一步改善农业生产条件，夺取明年农业丰收。
    三、适度倾斜，有保有压，争取工业生产的合理增长。要充分发挥国营大中型企业的骨干作用，根据国家产业政策的要求，采取多种形式，有重点有步骤地集中一部分资金、物资、运力等择优支持能源、重要原材料、支农产品、出口产品和适销对路的轻纺产品等重点企业搞好生产经营。同时，要进一步明确有关经济政策界线，发挥企业经营者和职工的积极性，促使眼睛向外转为眼睛向内，搞好内部挖潜工作，调整结构，增加品种，提高质量，降低消耗，改进服务。
    四、改进管理，控调结合，切实改善投资结构。一方面，要加强投资的计划管理，适当集中审批权限，并认真做好对已决定停缓建项目、新开工项目和在建项目的督查工作，严格政纪，违纪必纠。另一方面，要区别对待，强化投资结构的调整工作。一要切实集中一部分资金做好重点项目，尤其是农业、煤炭、电力、交通和重要原材料项目的建设工作，清理工程款拖欠问题，保证重点建设项目的合理工期进度，保持国民经济发展后劲。二要适当增加大中型骨干企业用于产品更新换代、提高质量的更新改造投资，加快企业生产结构的调整。三要进一步压缩一般性加工工业和楼堂馆所建设。四要加强对市政建设和商品房投资的管理。近几年，县改市、市升级等不断扩大，随之而来的是市政建设大量铺开。在调整时期，应暂缓新建市的审批。商品房建设今后应加强管理。
    五、加强工商合作，积极疏导，改进市场销售工作。目前市场疲软，除少数长线商品外，多数商品仅仅是相对剩余，对市场的潜在压力还在增大，整个市场供求紧张的矛盾仍未消除。因此，一方面，国家要积极帮助理顺工商之间的关系，区别对待，搞活产销。建议适当筹集一部分专项资金，贴息支持国营商业企业收购人民生活必需品等有利国计民生的商品，作为国家储备，以发挥国营商业的“蓄水池”作用，既可保证明年的供应，又可以促销增产，提高效益。另一方面，要采取灵活措施，疏通渠道，合理引导居民消费。
    六、整顿秩序，加强监管，严格控制市场物价上涨。尽管今年以来市场零售物价涨幅逐月回落，但价格总水平仍然居高不下，物价涨幅的回落主要是靠强化行政干预和增加财政补贴，潜在的涨价压力仍然比较大，稍一放松，有可能导致新的一轮涨价，影响市场稳定。与此同时，市场秩序混乱局面尚未根本治理，违法现象仍多。因此，要继续把整顿流通秩序放在重要位置，逐步恢复正常经济秩序，促进正常的经营活动的开展。要继续严格物价管理权限，未经审批，不得随意涨价。要在控制物价过程中，把握时机，切实理顺一些不合理的价格关系。
    七、创造条件，增加出口，大力压缩进口。要努力增加出口资源，在改进外贸体制的同时，积极调整出口产品的质量档次和品种结构，努力开拓新市场。同时要加强进口商品替代工作，压缩那些高档消费品和一般产品的进口，节约外汇。要进一步做好对外宣传工作，改善利用外资、旅游、国际援助等非贸易收入状况，缓解外汇紧张的矛盾。
