Title: On the Matter of "Following Established Precedents"

According to the Ming Dynasty text *Yùtáng Cónghuà*, when Liu Dasha took up his post as the Governor of Guangdong, he discovered a type of money called "xiànyú" that was not recorded in the accounts and was used exclusively by the Governor for personal expenses, equivalent to today's "little treasury," and this practice had become an established precedent. The accountant told him that there was still some "xiànyú" money left and advised him to "follow established precedents."

Liu Dasha remained silent for a long time and then loudly declared: "I, Liu Dasha, aspire to be a good person. To do such a thing would be to betray the ancient sages; how could I still be considered a man of principle!" He then ordered the accountant to record all the "xiànyú" money in the accounts, and from then on, this "precedent" would no longer be followed.

Liu Dasha was a feudal official, and his aspirations were merely to maintain personal integrity. We cite this example because his attitude towards "precedents" is somewhat reasonable.

Today's corruption often begins with "following established precedents." Some comrades are originally very cautious and can indeed "start with myself" on many issues, especially when it comes to unearned money that comes to them, they are very vigilant, fearing that they might set a precedent that harms party discipline and violates laws and regulations. However, when they arrive at a new place or take up a new position, they often "follow the old ways" in the face of existing "precedents."

For example, living in accommodations above the standard, or feasting during inspections, these things were not started by them, but they are indeed "inherited" by them.

Those who "follow established precedents" either do not understand the issue, thinking that since it is a "precedent," it must be "acceptable." Some people pretend to be ignorant. They know that such "precedents" violate party and state discipline, but there are benefits to be gained. Even if one day they are exposed, they can use the "precedent" as an excuse. Moreover, breaking the "precedent" is likely to offend people.

For instance, if the predecessor or colleagues all live in accommodations above the standard, breaking the "precedent" would offend many people.

In the realm of special privileges, there are "gentlemen" who "follow established precedents," and there will always be "villains" who create "precedents."

Some "accountants" not only advise the leaders to "follow" when there are "precedents" in their locality or department, but also, when there are no "precedents" in their locality or department, they will bring in "precedents" from other places or units to imitate.

In short, if the leaders are not resolute in such matters, they will gradually sink into the mire.

Therefore, to maintain party discipline and state discipline, one must have the spirit of "this shall not be a precedent," not be swayed by conventions, and not be shaken by "precedents."

Anything that does not meet the requirements of party discipline and state discipline should be stopped immediately, and the party's purpose—serving the people—must be upheld!

### 话说“循由成例”

    话说“循由成例”
    陆士华
    据明代《玉堂丛话》载：刘大厦到广东任布政使时，发现此间有一种名曰“羡余”的钱，不入帐，专供布政使私用，相当于今日的“小金库”，并已沿习成例。管帐小吏告诉他，还剩下一些“羡余”，劝他“循由成例”。
    刘大厦听后沉默良久，大声说道：我刘大厦志于做好人，做这样的事，岂不愧对古贤，哪里还算得大丈夫！于是令小吏把“羡余”钱全数入帐，今后不再作此“成例”。
    刘大厦是个封建官吏，他的那点志向，仅是为了洁身自好。我们引此典故是认为他对待“成例”的态度还是有几分道理的。
    如今的一些腐败现象就是从“循由成例”开始的。有些同志原本是很谨慎的，在许多问题上确能做到“从我做起”，特别是对送上门来的非份之财更加警惕，生怕由自己开了损害党风、违法乱纪的“先例”。然而，到了一个新地方，或者换了一个新岗位，在早有的“成例”面前，却往往“率由旧章”。
    例如，超标准住房，检查工作时大吃大喝，这些事确乎并非由他们开始，但又确乎在他们手里被“继承”下来。
    “循由成例”者，有的是认识问题，以为既然已是“成例”，当然是行得“通”的。有些人则是装糊涂。他们明知这种“成例”违背党纪政纪，但有利可图，即使有朝一日被揭露，也有“成例”可作开脱。再说，破除“成例”还容易得罪人。
    比如，前任或同事都超标准住房，你要破除“成例”该要得罪多少人。
    在特殊化方面有“循由成例”的“君子”，就会不断有制造“成例”的“小人”。
    有些“管帐小吏”不但在本地方、本部门有“成例”的时候劝领导“循”；而且本地方、本部门没有“成例”时，还会把别地方、别单位的“成例”拿来效法。
    总之，作领导的，只要在这类事情上不坚决，就会一步步陷下去。
    因此，要维护党风政纪，就要有“此”不为例的精神，不为惯例所左右，不为“成例”所动摇。
    凡不合乎党风政纪要求的，就该果断打住，唯党的宗旨——为人民服务是从！
