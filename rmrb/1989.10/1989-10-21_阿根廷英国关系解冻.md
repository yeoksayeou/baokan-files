Argentina and Britain have taken a significant step towards improving their relations. On October 18, representatives from both countries signed a joint statement in Madrid, marking the formal thawing of relations seven years after the end of the Malvinas Islands War.

Through substantive direct talks, the two countries have reached a series of agreements to improve their relations: both countries have decided to restore consular relations at the level of consul general; they have guaranteed not to seek compensation from each other for losses incurred during hostile actions; they have lifted all trade and financial restrictions against each other; they have resumed air and sea transport between the two countries; they have established working groups to study measures to avoid military accidents and to research fisheries cooperation and the protection of fisheries resources; they have decided to hold another round of talks next February to discuss the restoration of diplomatic relations. The British side announced that it would allow Argentine merchant ships to freely enter the military exclusion zone around the Malvinas Islands and reduce the military exclusion zone to align with the exclusive fishing zone. Britain also expressed its willingness to help Argentina establish cooperative relations with the European Community, and the British government can guarantee letters of credit for Argentina's exports to the UK. The Argentine side welcomed these British decisions.

The Argentina-Britain dispute over the Malvinas Islands has lasted for over 100 years, and a war broke out in 1982. Due to both sides' insistence on their respective sovereignty claims, the political and economic relations severed by the war have been difficult to restore. After the new Argentine President Menem took office, he proposed a new initiative to set aside the sovereignty issue, which led to this round of direct negotiations between the two countries. The joint statement announced that both sides agree that the content of this round of talks and future similar talks, as well as the actions taken by both sides and third parties to implement these agreements, do not imply recognition or change of either side's position on the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands and the surrounding waters. Argentine Foreign Minister Cavallo explained that this statement is the legal form of the "sovereignty umbrella." In reality, it means setting aside the disputed sovereignty issue indefinitely and preserving each side's position.

After the Malvinas Islands War in 1982, Argentina-Britain relations deteriorated, affecting Argentina's relations with the European Community and the United States. The current Argentine government believes that to gain full support from the United States and the European Community for its economic revival plan, it must improve relations with Britain. The United States also hopes that the Argentina-Britain dispute will not long-term affect its global strategy. Britain responded positively to Menem's proposal. The thawing of Argentina-Britain relations occurred in this context. Political analysts here believe that although Britain has made some concessions this time, it has not shown any flexibility on key issues such as reducing troops on the Malvinas Islands and lifting the military exclusion zone.

The improvement of Argentina-Britain relations will help ease tensions in the South Atlantic and facilitate Argentina's efforts to secure economic aid from developed countries, which is undoubtedly positive. However, the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands is a sensitive issue in Argentina that involves national pride, and many third-world countries believe it should be placed on the decolonization track. As long as this issue is not finally resolved, the further improvement of Argentina-Britain relations will remain constrained.

### 阿根廷英国关系解冻

　　阿根廷英国关系解冻
　　本报记者　李志明
    阿根廷和英国两国政府代表18日在马德里签署的一项联合声明，标志着马尔维纳斯群岛战争炮火停息7年之后，两国关系正式解冻，双方朝着改善关系迈出了重要的一步。
    阿英两国经过这次实质性直接会谈，达成了一系列改善关系的协议：两国决定恢复总领事级领事关系；保证不就敌对行动造成的损失向对方索赔；取消一切针对对方的贸易金融限制；恢复两国间的航空和海运联系；建立工作小组研究避免军事意外的措施，建立研究渔业合作和保护渔业资源的工作小组；决定明年2月再次举行会谈，讨论恢复外交关系问题。英国方面宣布允许阿根廷商船自由进入马岛周围军事禁区，并缩小军事禁区使其与专属捕鱼区界限一致。英国还表示愿意帮助阿根廷与欧洲共同体建立合作关系，英国政府可以替阿根廷银行为英国向阿出口开出的信用证担保。阿根廷方面对英国这些决定表示欢迎。
    阿英马岛争端已持续了100多年，1982年因此发生了一场战争。由于双方坚持各自的主权要求，战争中断绝的政治经济关系一直难以恢复。阿根廷新总统梅内姆就职后，为了打破僵局，提出了将主权问题置于保护伞下的新主张，促成了这次两国直接谈判。联合声明宣布，双方同意，本次会谈及今后类似会谈的内容和双方及第三方执行这些会谈协议的行动，均不意味着承认或改变双方对马尔维纳斯群岛和周围海域主权的立场。阿根廷外交部长卡瓦略解释说，这段表述就是“主权保护伞”的法律形式。实际上就是将双方争执的焦点主权问题无限期搁置，保留各自的立场。
    1982年马岛战争后，阿英关系恶化，使阿根廷同欧洲共同体和美国的关系都受到影响。本届阿根廷政府认为，要获得美国和欧洲共同体对其经济复兴计划的全面支持，必须改善同英国的关系，美国也希望阿英交恶不要长期影响其全球战略。英国对梅内姆的建议作出积极响应。阿英关系解冻就是在这种背景下发生的。这里的政治分析家认为，英国虽然这次做了一些让步，但是在减少马岛驻军和取消军事禁区这些关键问题上没有一点松动。
    阿英关系改善有利于缓和南大西洋局势，便于阿根廷争取发达国家的经济援助，无疑具有积极意义。但马岛主权在阿根廷国内是一个涉及民族自尊的敏感问题，在国际上不少第三世界国家认为应该把它纳入非殖民化轨道。只要这个问题得不到最终合理解决，阿英关系的进一步改善仍将受到制约。
