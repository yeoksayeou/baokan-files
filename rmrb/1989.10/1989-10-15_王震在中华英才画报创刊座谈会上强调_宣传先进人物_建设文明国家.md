	Wang Zhen, at the founding conference of the Chinese Talents Magazine, emphasized the need to promote advanced figures and build a civilized nation.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 14th: The Chinese Talents Magazine, with the names of Deng Xiaoping and Bo Yibo written for its title, was launched today. Wang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the State, said at the founding conference of this large-scale publication that doing a good job in promoting outstanding figures is an important responsibility of the news, publicity, and publishing departments. The comrades in these departments should study Jiang Zemin's speech at the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and strive to promote the advanced and model figures from all fronts, thereby promoting the material and spiritual civilization construction of our socialist country.

	The Chinese Talents Magazine is the first large-scale publication in New China that mainly features the introduction of outstanding figures from all fronts with both text and images. Comrades Song Ping and Wen Jiabao congratulated the launch of this magazine. Today, more than 40 well-known figures from the relevant departments in Beijing, as well as from the news, publishing, and publicity sectors, gathered in the Yunnan Hall of the Great Hall of the People to have a lively discussion on strengthening the promotion of outstanding and advanced figures and improving the art of promotion.

	Those who spoke at the conference included He Jingzhi, Vice Minister of the Propaganda Department, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Culture, and President of the Chinese Talents Magazine; Wang Xiaopeng, Chief Editor of the Chinese Talents Magazine; Zhong Peizhang, Chief Supervisor of the Chinese Talents Magazine; Jiang Guanhuai, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel; Chen Yeping, former Minister of the Organization Department of the CPC; Han Ling, Deputy Secretary of the Organization Department of the CPC; Yang Chen, Advisor to the Ministry of Civil Affairs; Zhang Changhai, Chief Editor of the Guangming Daily; He Jingxiu, Chief Editor of the Central Literature and History Publishing House; Qu Qiyu, Deputy Director of the National Committee on Aging; and Zhang Zitao, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Central Advisory Commission.

	They believed in their speeches that scientifically and accurately introducing and promoting the advanced and model figures from all fronts is a major issue related to what kind of examples, thoughts, and deeds we use to inspire, educate, and unite the people. It is a major issue related to the revitalization of national spirit and the promotion of the four modernizations. Promoting and learning from outstanding figures is something our Party has always advocated. In recent years, due to the rampant spread of bourgeois liberalization, there has been too little promotion of the large number of outstanding figures emerging on all fronts. The contributions, status, and role of our labor models, heroes, and advanced workers have been mentioned too little. This is a serious mistake in our work, and now is the time to strengthen the promotion and reporting of outstanding figures.

	Wang Zhen said in his speech that in the past few years, due to the rampant spread of bourgeois liberalization, some outstanding figures who insisted on the four cardinal principles and made contributions to the Party and the people were labeled as having rigid thinking. We should correct this inversion of right and wrong through various means of publicity. All levels of leading cadres should lead the people to study Jiang Zemin's speech, unite around the third generation of the Party's leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core, carry forward national culture, learn from outstanding models, work hard, build the country with thrift, and strive for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

	Wang Zhaohua, Director of the National Committee on Aging, presided over the conference.

    王震在中华英才画报创刊座谈会上强调
    宣传先进人物　建设文明国家
    据新华社北京10月14日电  邓小平、薄一波同志分别题写刊名的《中华英才》画报今天在此间创刊。国家副主席王震在这家大型刊物创刊座谈会上说，做好优秀人物的宣传工作，是新闻、宣传、出版等部门的一项重要职责，这些部门的同志要认真学好江泽民同志在国庆40周年大会上的讲话，努力宣传好各条战线上的先进模范人物，以推动我国社会主义的物质文明建设和精神文明建设。
    《中华英才》是新中国成立以来第一家以宣传介绍各条战线优秀人物为主要内容的图文并茂的大型刊物。宋平、温家宝等同志向这家画报的创刊表示祝贺。今天，首都有关部门负责人和新闻界、出版界、宣传界40多位知名人士，聚会在人民大会堂云南厅，热烈座谈了加强优秀先进人物的宣传、提高宣传艺术的问题。
    先后在座谈会上发言的有中宣部副部长、文化部代部长、《中华英才》画报社社长贺敬之，《中华英才》总编辑王霄鹏，《中华英才》总监事钟沛璋，人事部副部长蒋冠庄，中组部原部长陈野苹，中组部副秘书长韩灵，民政部顾问杨琛，光明日报总编辑张常海，中央文献出版社总编辑何静修，老龄委副主任曲琪玉，中顾委会务室副主任张稚涛等。他们在发言中认为，科学地、准确地介绍和宣传各条战线上的先进模范人物，是关系到用什么样的榜样、什么样的思想、什么样的事迹去激励、教育、团结人民群众的大问题，是关系到振奋民族精神、促进四化建设的大问题。宣传优秀人物、学习优秀人物，这是我们党历来提倡的。近几年来，由于资产阶级自由化泛滥，对各条战线上涌现出的大批优秀人物宣传太少，对于我们的劳模、英模和先进工作者的贡献、地位和作用讲得太少，这是我们工作中的一个严重失误，现在到了应大力加强优秀人物宣传报道的时候了。
    王震在讲话中说，过去几年间，由于资产阶级自由化的泛滥，一些坚持四项基本原则、为党为人民努力做贡献的优秀人物，被说成是思想僵化。我们应该通过各种宣传手段，把这种被颠倒了的是非纠正过来。各级领导干部要带领人民学好江泽民同志的讲话，团结在以江泽民为核心的党的第三代领导集体的周围，弘扬民族文化，向优秀模范人物学习，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，为建设有中国特色的社会主义而努力奋斗。
    全国老龄委员会主任王照华主持了座谈会。
