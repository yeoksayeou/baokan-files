Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 11th.

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held an enlarged meeting of its chairpersons from October 9th to 11th in Zhongnanhai to study the speech given by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Li Xiannian, the Chairman, attended the morning session today and delivered a speech. He said that Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech fully reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping's spirit of calmly considering the past and the future. It is of great significance for uniting the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of all nationalities in China, boosting morale, overcoming difficulties, and stabilizing and developing the current political and economic situation in China. It is also of great significance for focusing on economic construction, adhering to the four cardinal principles, continuing with reform and opening up, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

When discussing the work of the CPPCC, Li Xiannian emphasized that the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party is an integral part of China's socialist new-type political system. He said that the democratic parties are neither opposition parties nor parties that oppose the Communist Party but are friendly parties that cooperate closely with the Communist Party. He pointed out that this is a characteristic and advantage of China's political life, a common creation of our Party and the democratic parties, and something that Western democracy cannot match.

Li Xiannian said that we must continue to work hard to make political consultation and democratic supervision regular and institutionalized. He stressed that in China, we absolutely cannot adopt the Western-style multi-party system or have opposition parties. Some people who hold a bourgeois liberalization stance want to follow the Western path of multi-party politics and rotational governance to carry out political system reforms. In essence, they aim to negate the socialist democratic system where the people are masters and to implement the Western bourgeois democratic system. Doing so would inevitably lead to the abolition of the Communist Party's leadership and the negation of socialism. This is absolutely not allowed.

The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Wang Renhe. In his speech, he said that during the previous period when bourgeois liberalization was rampant, some people took a completely negative attitude towards Comrade Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. This trend negated the history of the Chinese revolution and the great achievements made since the founding of the nation. In essence, it aimed to negate the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. Of course, our Party has also made various mistakes, but these mistakes have been corrected by the Party itself, summarized, and turned into good things. Our Party has been advancing by overcoming difficulties, correcting mistakes, and summing up experiences.

Wang Renhe emphasized that practice has proven that the Communist Party of China is a great, glorious, and correct party with fighting strength. Currently, we face many difficulties and problems, but we have the correct political line and organizational line. As long as we strengthen Party building, enforce Party discipline, unify the Party's thinking and actions, maintain close ties with the masses, and unite people of all nationalities to strive together, we can overcome all difficulties on the road ahead and achieve new and greater victories.

During the three and a half days of study, Vice Chairpersons Zhou Peiyuan, Ma Wenrui, Qian Xuesen, Simayi Aimaiti, Sun Xiaocun, Fang Yi, Wang Enmao, Qian Weichang, Qian Zhengying, Hou Jingru, Hu Sheng, Cheng Siyuan, Lu Jiashi, and Kang Keqing, among others, spoke one after another.

They believed that Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech has important guiding significance for the entire Party and the people of all nationalities in China to better think about the past and the future. It will play a very important role in unifying the Party's thinking and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities to strive for new victories in the Four Modernizations and reform and opening up.

In their speeches, they also discussed strengthening the Party's leadership, carrying forward the spirit of patriotism, adhering to the principles of independence, self-reliance, hard work, and frugal governance, strengthening democratic and legal construction, maintaining a stable and united political situation, adhering to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the Party's leadership, developing education, science, and culture, respecting knowledge and talent, and realizing the great cause of national reunification.

The meeting required all levels of the CPPCC, all participating units, all members, and staff to take the study and implementation of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech spirit as an important task in the current work. They should strive to improve and perfect the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party for the socialist cause and the great cause of national reunification. They should unite people of all nationalities and sectors to strive for the realization of China's current tasks.

Vice Secretaries-General of the National CPPCC, heads of various specialized committees, and heads of various departments of the CPPCC attended the meeting.

    政协主席扩大会议学习江泽民讲话
    李先念强调坚持共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度
    会议要求政协组织团结各界人士努力实现我国当前任务
    新华社北京10月11日电　（记者邹爱国、张孟仪）政协全国委员会10月9日至11日在中南海召开主席扩大会议，认真学习江泽民同志在庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年大会上的讲话。
    李先念主席出席了今天上午的会议并讲了话。他说，江泽民同志的讲话充分体现了邓小平同志关于要冷静地考虑一下过去，也考虑一下未来的讲话精神，对于统一全党和全国各族人民的思想，振奋精神，克服困难，稳定和发展当前我国的政治经济形势，对于以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，建设有中国特色的社会主义，都具有十分重要的意义。
    谈到人民政协工作时，李先念强调，共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度，是我国社会主义的新型政治制度的一个组成部分。他说，各民主党派既不是在野党、更不是反对党，而是同共产党亲密合作的友党。他指出，这是我国政治生活中的一个特点和优点，是我们党和各民主党派的一个共同的创造，是西方的民主所不能比拟的。
    李先念说，我们要继续努力，使政治协商和民主监督走向经常化和制度化。他强调，在中国绝不能实行西方那样的多党制，搞什么反对党。有些坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，想按照西方的多党制、轮流执政的思路来搞政治体制改革，实质上是妄图否定人民群众当家作主的社会主义民主制度，而实行西方资产阶级民主制度。那样做势必导致取消共产党的领导、否定社会主义。这是绝对不能允许的。
    会议由王任重副主席主持。他在讲话中说，在前一段资产阶级自由化泛滥的时候，有人对毛泽东同志和毛泽东思想采取全盘否定的态度。这股思潮否定中国革命的历史，否定建国以来所取得的巨大成就，其实质就是要否定共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。当然，我们党也曾犯过这样那样的错误，但是这些错误都是我们党自己纠正过来，加以总结，从而使坏事变成好事的。我们党就是在克服困难、纠正错误、总结经验中不断前进的。
    王任重强调，实践证明，中国共产党是伟大、光荣、正确的党，是有战斗力的党。当前，我们面临不少困难和问题，但是我们有正确的政治路线和组织路线，只要我们切实加强党的建设，严肃党的纪律，全党统一认识，统一行动，密切联系群众，团结各族人民共同奋斗，就可以克服前进道路上的一切困难，取得新的更大胜利。
    在三个半天的学习中，周培源、马文瑞、钱学森、司马义·艾买提、孙晓村、方毅、王恩茂、钱伟长、钱正英、侯镜如、胡绳、程思远、卢嘉锡、康克清副主席等先后发言。
    他们认为，江泽民同志的讲话对全党和全国各族人民更好地思考过去、思考未来，有着重要的指导意义，对于统一全党思想，调动全国各族人民的积极性，争取四化建设、改革开放的新胜利，将产生十分重要的作用。
    在发言中，大家还分别就加强党的领导，发扬爱国主义精神，坚持独立自主、自力更生，艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的方针，加强民主与法制建设，维护安定团结的政治局面，坚持党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，发展教育、科技、文化事业，尊重知识、尊重人才，实现祖国统一大业等问题，发表了意见。
    会议要求人民政协各级组织、各参加单位、全体委员和机关工作人员，把学习贯彻江泽民同志的讲话精神作为当前工作的重要任务，为改进和完善共产党领导的、为社会主义事业和祖国统一大业共同奋斗的多党合作和政治协商制度，团结各族各界人士为实现我国当前的各项任务而努力奋斗。
    全国政协副秘书长、各专门委员会和政协机关各部门负责人等列席了会议。（附图片）
