Title: Songs from the Other Shore

Date: 1989-10-12
Edition: 8

The collection "Contemporary Taiwanese Poetry," in two volumes (published by Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House), encompasses nearly 40 years of poetry from 1949 to 1987, featuring works from over 280 poets, from the "Three Elders of Poetry" to young poets in their prime. It can be considered a comprehensive anthology of Taiwanese poetry. It is a valuable resource for studying Taiwanese literature and promoting the exchange of poetic arts across the Taiwan Strait. It is an indispensable part of contemporary Chinese literature. Ai Qing wrote the preface: "Songs from the Other Shore."

Looking back at contemporary Taiwanese poetry over the past 38 years, it has been quite active, with over 100 poetry societies and journals emerging. Each has its own poetic vision. After a period of restless exploration, they collectively sought to return to their cultural roots and embrace tradition. After absorbing, being influenced by, and learning from the spirit, colors, and techniques of Western modern poetry, they re-rooted themselves in the soil of the national language, giving new life to Chinese poetry. This is a transformation process from difference to similarity, and a process of painful pursuit and joyful attainment. "Poetry Anthology" provides us with comprehensive and dense information, as if opening two large doors to understand the entire landscape of the island's poetry. At the same time, it helps us reflect on the exploration of mainland poetry in recent years, from the proliferation of various schools and ideologies to the current state of quiet introspection and wandering. Rather than creating an opportunity for comparing poetry across the Taiwan Strait, it is more of an enlightenment on the value orientation of poetry.

"The Anthology" mainly consists of poems selected by the poets themselves. At the same time, the editors adhere to the principle of national selection, openly stating the "seven non-selections": (1) Poems that harm Chinese culture and national feelings are not selected; (2) Crooked poems are not selected; (3) Strange poems are not selected; (4) Lewd poems, poems with low consciousness, and poems of low taste are not selected; (5) Poems with rigid structures are not selected; (6) Poems with overly long sentences and exaggerated expressions are not selected; (7) Poems with mixed foreign languages are not selected. The works are arranged in the order of the poets' birth years, making it interesting and worth reading.

    彼岸歌声
    刘斌夫
    《当代台湾诗萃》上、下册（湖南文艺出版社出版），囊括了1949——1987近40年来，上起“诗坛三老”下至弱冠年华的诗人280余家的1000余首代表作品。可称“全台诗”揽胜。它是研究台湾文学，促进海峡两岸诗歌艺术交流可资可鉴的当代诗歌总集，是中华民族当代文学史不可或缺的组成部分。艾青为书的扉页题辞：彼岸歌声。
    纵观台湾当代诗，38年来甚为活跃，相继有100多个诗社与诗刊出现。大都有各自的诗歌观。经过一段躁动不安的探索之后又不约而同地寻根文化，回归传统。呼吸、濡染、借鉴了西方现代诗歌的气息、色彩与技巧之后，又从新植根于民族语言的土壤中，赋与了华夏诗歌以新的生命。这是由异到同的变革过程，也是痛苦地追求而欣悦地获得的发展过程。《诗萃》给我们提供了全方位的密集信息，似打开了两扇大门，借以了解彼岛诗坛全貌。同时有助于我们对大陆近几年诗歌探索由旗竿四起、主义纷呈到走向平静、去意彷徨的反思。与其说造就了海峡两岸诗歌比较的某种契机，毋宁说是诗歌价值取向的启示。
    《诗萃》多为诗人自选诗。同时编选者以为民族选诗为宗旨，开诚布公“七不选”：（一）一切有损中华文化和民族感情的诗不选；（二）歪诗不选；（三）怪诗不选；（四）淫诗、意识低下、贱格的诗不选；（五）圆案诗不选；（六）句子过长过分夸张的诗不选；（七）夹杂外文的诗不选。作品用诗人“生年”长幼为序，意趣盎然，值得一读。
