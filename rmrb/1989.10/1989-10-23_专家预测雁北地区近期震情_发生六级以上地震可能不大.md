		Experts Predict Seismic Activity in Yananbei Region
		Chance of 6.0 Magnitude or Higher Earthquake is Low

		Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 22 — Dozens of experts from the state and Shanxi Province, after conducting comprehensive observations and monitoring in the Yananbei region, have made predictions and assessments: the likelihood of a 6.0 magnitude or higher earthquake occurring in the Yananbei region in the near term is low. However, attention should be paid to the possibility of earthquakes around 4.5 magnitude occurring in the affected area.

		The experts explained that the recent series of earthquakes in the Yananbei region, with a perceived range of about 500 kilometers in diameter, have affected Beijing, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces and regions. This is the strongest earthquake in the North China region since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, named the "Datong-Yanggao" earthquake. Based on the available data, this earthquake may be of the swarm type, with an estimated longer duration. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome complacency and continue to strengthen prevention. Attention should be paid to the possibility of 4.5 magnitude earthquakes occurring at any time, and measures should be taken in advance to minimize unnecessary losses.

　　专家预测雁北地区近期震情
　　发生六级以上地震可能不大
    新华社太原10月22日电  国家和山西省数十名地震专家，在雁北地区经过多方面现场观察和监测，并进行综合分析后作出预测和估计：雁北地区近期6级以上地震发生的可能性不大，但要注意震区4.5级左右地震发生的可能性。
    地震专家们介绍说：雁北地区近日发生的多次大小地震，有感范围直径为500公里左右，波及到北京、河北、内蒙古等省区，是1976年唐山大地震以来华北地区发生的一次最强烈的地震，定名为“大同—阳高”地震。根据已占有的资料分析，这次地震可能属于震群型，持续时间估计要长一些，因此要克服侥幸心理，继续加强防范。要注意4.5级左右地震的随时发生，及早采取措施，尽量减少不必要的损失。
