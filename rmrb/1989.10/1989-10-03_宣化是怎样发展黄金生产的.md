The amount of gold delivered to the state by Xuanhua County in Hebei Province has been increasing year by year. In 1978, the county began investing in gold production, producing 3,000 taels annually. By 1985, it had entered the ranks of the top 20 gold-producing counties in the country with an annual output of over 10,000 taels.

Strict Rectification and Elimination of Individual Gold Mining

Xuanhua County is located in the western part of the Yanshan Mountains, where gold resources are relatively abundant. In 1970, the Ministry of Metallurgy invested in the construction of the state-owned Zhangjiakou Gold Mine. In 1978, the county invested in the construction of the county-owned Zhangquanzhuang Gold Mine. By 1984, under the encouragement of policies at the time, the county experienced a gold mining boom. Apart from the state-owned and county-owned gold mines, hundreds of gold mining points operated by townships, villages, and individuals emerged, with nearly 10,000 farmers engaged in gold mining. This resulted in a doubling of gold production compared to the previous year. However, due to the lack of planning in collective mining, management difficulties, and widespread resource waste, environmental pollution and gold smuggling issues began to surface.

These increasingly serious problems drew the attention of the county's Party Committee and government. To prevent the destruction of precious resources, the county formulated and improved the "Temporary Regulations on Gold Production Management in Xuanhua County" and its "Implementation Details" in 1986 and 1987. It also organized six large-scale rectification campaigns involving personnel from the industrial and commercial, tax, public security, and environmental protection departments to crack down on individual and village-operated gold grinding mills, gold ball mills, and gold refining points. Strict regulations were enforced, stipulating that gold ore must be managed, allocated, and settled by the county's gold company, with no individual or other entities allowed to transport gold ore.

Through rectification, the chaotic situation of shallow mining, discarding deep resources, exploiting rich ores while abandoning poor ones, and illegal mining and refining was brought under control. This allowed the county's gold production to become standardized, resources to be fully utilized, and gold production to increase significantly. Last year, the remaining 11 township and town gold processing enterprises alone delivered 2,452 taels of gold to the state, matching the total amount delivered by individual, village, township, and town operations before the rectification.

Supporting State-Owned Enterprises and Implementing Inclined Policies

While vigorously rectifying collective mining, the county implemented inclined policies for county-owned state gold mines. First, the originally township-owned Daye Yang Gold Mine was taken over as a county-owned state mine through profit-sharing measures. Last year, the county invested 17.5 million yuan to complete the technical upgrade and expansion of the Daye Yang and Zhangquanzhuang mines. To ensure the production of county-owned gold mines and extend their service life, the county implemented the principle of "concentrating resources and protecting key areas" for ore supply. Three mining areas that had submitted geological reports were designated for county-owned gold mines to operate. Last year, despite the shortage of ore sources for township and town gold processing enterprises, the county decided to supply the ore from the county-owned Zhan Shan Gold Mine exclusively to the county-owned gold mines, ensuring their production. The county also overcame various difficulties to prioritize the needs of county-owned gold mines in terms of electricity, funds, and materials.

In developing gold production, the county government considered the overall situation and cooperated with and supported the state-owned Zhangjiakou Gold Mine within its jurisdiction. According to the mining needs of the state-owned mine, the county did not hesitate to sacrifice local interests and withdrew two mining teams from the rich ore areas adjacent to the state-owned mine.

Strengthening Legal Measures and Cracking Down on Smuggling Crimes

To create a good external environment for gold production and prevent gold from falling into the hands of lawbreakers, Xuanhua County fully utilized and strengthened legal measures to severely crack down on gold smuggling crimes. The county's gold company established four gold management offices, and the county's public security bureau set up a gold police station and a gold smuggling interception team, equipped with advanced equipment. This effectively suppressed gold smuggling crimes and maintained social order and production order in the gold-producing areas. From 1986 to the present, the county has seized a total of 24,967.25 grams of smuggled gold and 983,000 yuan in cash.

    宣化是怎样发展黄金生产的
    王克强　张荣跃　陈建军
    河北省宣化县上交给国家的黄金逐年递增：1978年县里开始投资开发黄金生产，年产3000两；1985年跨入全国20个黄金万两县的行列。
    严格整顿　取缔个体采金
    宣化县地处燕山山脉西部，境内黄金资源较为丰富。1970年由冶金部投资兴建了国营张家口金矿。1978年由县里投资兴建了县营张全庄金矿。到1984年，在当时政策的鼓励下，该县形成了黄金开采的高潮，除开国营和县营金矿外，乡、村、个体采金摊点发展到上百个，近万名农民从事黄金开采业，使得当年的黄金产量比上年翻了一番。然而，由于群采缺乏规划，不便管理，资源浪费现象十分普遍。环境污染、黄金走私等问题也开始出现。
    这些逐渐暴露并日趋严重的问题，引起县委、县政府的高度重视。为了防止毁坏宝贵的资源，该县连续于1986年、1987年两次制订、修改完善了《宣化县黄金生产管理暂行规定》及《实施细则》，并先后6次大规模地组织工商、税务、公安和环保等部门的人员，深入黄金产区进行整顿，取缔了全部个体和村办的选金电碾子90盘，个体和联办的选金球磨机35台，个体土氰化炼金点1千多处。严格规定，黄金矿石由县黄金公司统一定价、统一管理、统一调配、统一结算，严禁个人或其他单位贩运金矿石。
    经过整顿，采表弃深、挖富丢贫、滥采乱挖、非法选炼的混乱局面基本得到控制，使全县黄金生产步入正规，资源得到充分利用，黄金产量大幅度提高。去年，仅保留的11个乡、镇选金企业就向国家交售黄金2452两，与整顿前个体、村办、乡、镇交售的总量持平。
    扶持国营　实行倾斜政策
    在大刀阔斧整顿群采的同时，对县属地方国营金矿实行倾斜政策。先是将原来属于乡办的大白阳金矿通过让利措施，收归为地方国营矿。去年又投资1750万元，完成了大白阳和张全庄矿这两座县营金矿的技改、扩建工程。为了给县营金矿备足生产后劲，延长服务年限，该县还实行“压分散、保骨干”的矿石供应原则。将提交地质报告的3个矿区划定由县营金矿开采。去年，在乡、镇选金企业矿源比较紧缺的情况下，果断决定将原供乡、镇选金企业的县营钻山金矿开采的矿石专供县营金矿，有力地保证了县营金矿的生产。该县还克服种种困难，优先满足县营金矿在电力、资金、物资等方面的需要。
    在发展黄金生产中，县政府注意从大局出发，对境内的国营张家口金矿予以合作和支持。根据国营矿采掘需要，不惜牺牲局部利益，将2个采矿队从与国营矿邻近的富矿区中撤出来。
    强化法制　打击走私犯罪
    为了给黄金生产创造良好的外部环境，防止黄金流入不法分子手中，宣化县充分运用和强化法制手段，严厉打击黄金走私犯罪。县黄金公司成立了4个黄金管理所，县公安局成立了黄金派出所和黄金辑私队，配备先进设备，有力地打击了黄金走私犯罪，维护了黄金产区的社会治安和生产秩序。从1986年至今，该县总共缴获走私黄金24967.25克，现金98.3万元。
