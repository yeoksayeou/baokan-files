Quality is the life of commodities. The phenomenon of substandard and counterfeit commodities flooding the market needs to be taken seriously by society because it disrupts the socialist economic order.

The quality of commodities is the life of commodities. It not only affects the reputation of producers and operators but also the interests of consumers and users.

The quality of commodities includes the suitability, reliability, and economy of the commodities. Improving the quality of commodities involves comprehensive quality management during the design and production processes and improving based on feedback information after the commodities are released to the market.

Currently, some manufacturers and retailers (including individual business owners) do not focus on how to improve and honestly introduce the quality of their commodities but rather on how to make money: although their commodities do not meet the standards of "leading the world's new trends" or "renowned globally," they use such sensational phrases in their advertisements; although their goods are of poor quality and have been accumulated, they sell them in the form of "new product exhibitions" and "discount sales" to stimulate people's desire to consume; although they are passing off inferior goods as superior ones, falsifying information, and being dishonest, they attract business with scarce or trendy goods. However, the most practical consumers, after purchasing, find themselves "deceived" and greatly troubled.

Consumers are the gods of commodities. The production of commodities must prioritize quality. The promotion of commodities must prioritize honest introductions and superior services. This is the minimum professional ethics for socialist enterprises and businesses. The Jiangsu Yuncheng Radio Factory, when advertising for the "Yanwu Recorder," not only listed the local retail price for each unit but also clearly stated: "10-day return guarantee, 30-day exchange guarantee, and lifetime maintenance." This courage to place themselves under the supervision of consumers and faithfully serve the people is rarely seen in the country. Can those manufacturers of "globally renowned" products and those with products lacking competitiveness have the same courage as "Yanwu"?

To protect the vast number of consumers from the harm of counterfeit and substandard commodities, relevant departments should legally handle those who manufacture and sell counterfeit and substandard commodities for profit and deception after investigation; consumers who are harmed should also learn to use legal weapons to protect their legitimate rights and interests.

### 质量是商品的生命

    质量是商品的生命
    不合格的商品、伪劣商品充斥市场的现象，需要引起社会的重视。因为它扰乱了社会主义经济秩序。
    商品的质量是商品的生命。它不仅关系着生产者、经营者的声誉，而且关系着消费者、使用者的利益。
    商品质量包括商品的适用性、可靠性和经济性。商品质量的提高，一方面通过设计、生产过程中的全面质量管理；一方面通过投放市场后反馈的信息进行改进。
    现在的情况是，一些厂家、店家（包括个体经营户）不是把精力放在如何提高和如实介绍商品的质量上，而是放在如何赚钱上：明明他们的商品够不上“领导世界新潮流”、“誉满全球”，可做广告时却非要用这种耸人听闻的字眼；明明他们的货因质次被积压，却以“新产品展销”、“让利大甩卖”等形式兜售，以刺激人们的消费欲；明明他们是以次充好，弄虚作假，名不副实，却以紧俏货、新潮货招揽生意。然而，最讲实惠的消费者购买后，却为“上当、受骗”，大伤脑筋。
    消费者是商品的上帝。商品的生产，必须把质量放在第一位。商品的推销，必须把如实介绍和优质服务放在第一位。这也是社会主义企业、商业起码的职业道德。江苏盐城无线电总厂在为“燕舞收录机”作广告时，不仅标出每台的当地零售价，而且明确宣布：“10天内保退、30天内保换、终身保修”。这种勇于把自己置身于消费者的监督之下，忠实为群众服务的魄力，恐怕在国内是不多见的。那些生产“誉满全球”产品的厂家，那些产品缺乏竞争力的厂家，能有“燕舞”的魄力吗？
    为使广大消费者免受伪劣商品之害，对于那种唯利是图、坑人骗钱的伪劣商品的制造者、经营者，有关部门查实后就应依法处理；作为受害的消费者，也应学会运用法律武器，维护自己的正当权益。
