The bully's face exposed again

	Newspaper reporter Wu Jin

	According to a report in the October 13 issue of the American newspaper Los Angeles Times, the U.S. Department of Justice authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation in mid-June this year to capture any "suspects" identified by the United States in foreign countries without prior consent from the relevant authorities of those countries. In the afternoon of the 13th, spokesmen from the White House and the Department of Justice were forced to admit the existence of this matter when pressed by reporters.

	The Department of Justice spokesman said on the 13th: "Before this opinion was finalized, it was communicated to all relevant departments within the government and consultations were conducted with them."

	The law enforcement agency of a country is actually going to another country to enforce its own laws at will, what kind of issue is this? The United States, which has always advocated "rule of law," should be very clear about this. In fact, as early as 1980, the U.S. Department of Justice had rejected a similar government request, explicitly stating that such actions violate international law.

	So, why is the same U.S. Department of Justice now flip-flopping? Obviously, this is due to the practical need to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries to maintain U.S. interests. From the reports in the Los Angeles Times and the current series of developments, it can be seen that the "suspects" referred to by the U.S. Department of Justice are individuals like Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian Defense Forces commander, who are accused by the United States of participating in international drug trafficking.

	The United States is eager to eliminate the defiant General Noriega, which is no secret and has been the established policy of the past two U.S. administrations. To this end, Washington has imposed economic blockades and military threats on the Panamanian government, even inciting a few Panamanian officers to stage repeated coups, but these tactics have so far been ineffective. On the morning of the 13th, President Bush reiterated at a press conference: "As long as Noriega can be toppled, I don't care if force is used"; it's just that "fear of collateral damage" makes the White House hesitate to take the risk of direct military intervention, fearing it might provoke strong anti-American sentiments in Latin American countries. The decision to authorize the FBI to send agents abroad to conduct kidnappings was made against this backdrop.

	The United States' various acts of gross interference in Panamanian internal affairs, especially its attempt to legalize kidnapping activities abroad, seriously undermine internationally recognized norms of international relations and violate international law. The October 14 issue of the Washington Post quoted an international law professor named Edward Wise as saying: "If (kidnapping activities are conducted) without the consent of the local (government), I don't see any difference between this and the act of invading another country by sending troops across the border." California Democratic Representative Dorn Edwards expressed concern that the decision by the U.S. Department of Justice would make the United States an "international outlaw."

	The issue, of course, is not just about dealing with one Noriega. This also means that the United States can use this to deal with anyone it does not like, as long as it identifies the person as a "suspect" in a criminal case. The U.S. authorities often accuse certain countries of engaging in "state terrorism," so the question is: if the United States' actions are carried out, what kind of "ism" would that be?

    霸权嘴脸再次暴露
    新华社记者  吴晋
    据10月13日的美国《洛杉矶时报》透露：美国司法部今年6月中旬曾授权联邦调查局，在外国捉拿美国指认的任何“嫌疑犯”时，可以无需事先征得有关国家当局的同意。13日下午，白宫和司法部的发言人在新闻记者们的追问下，被迫承认确有此事。
  司法部发言人13日说：“在最终确定这项意见之前，曾通知政府中的各有关部门，并同它们进行了磋商。”
    一个国家的执法机构竟然要到别的国家去为所欲为地执行本国的法律，这是什么性质的问题？向来标榜“法治”的美国对此应该是很清楚的。事实上，早在1980年，美国司法部就曾否决过政府的一项类似要求，明确指出这种做法违反国际法。
    那么，同一个美国司法部如今为什么会出尔反尔呢？显然这是出于为了维护美国利益而干涉别国内政的实际需要。从《洛杉矶时报》的报道和当前的一系列事态发展可以看出，美国司法部所谓的“嫌疑犯”系指被美国指控为参与国际毒品走私的巴拿马国防军司令诺列加一类的人物。
    美国对桀骜不驯的诺列加将军务欲去之而后快，这已经不是什么秘密，而是最近两届美国政府的既定政策。为此，华盛顿对巴拿马当局实行了经济封锁和武力恫吓，乃至唆使巴拿马少数军官一再发动政变，但是这些招数迄今未能奏效，13日上午，布什总统在一次记者招待会上重申：只要能整垮诺列加，他“并不在乎是否使用武力”；只是“投鼠忌器”，考虑到直接出兵可能会在拉美各国引起强烈的反美情绪，白宫才迟迟未敢孤注一掷，出兵干涉。授权联邦调查局派遣特工人员到国外进行绑架的决定就是在这种背景下作出的。
    美国政府粗暴干涉巴拿马内政的种种做法，尤其是它企图将在国外进行绑架活动合法化，严重破坏了公认的国际关系准则，违反了国际法。14日的《华盛顿邮报》援引一位名叫爱德华·怀斯的国际法教授的话说：“如果不经当地（政府）同意（就进行绑架活动），我看不出这同构成入侵行为的派兵越境有什么区别。”加利福尼亚州民主党众议员多恩·爱德华表示担心，美司法部的决定将会使美国成为“国际恶棍”。
    问题当然还不仅仅在于对付一个诺列加，这还意味着美国可以以此来对付它所不喜欢的任何人，只要它认定此人是某一犯罪案件的“嫌疑犯”就行了。美国当局不是动辄指责某些外国搞“国家恐怖主义”吗？试问：美国的这种做法一旦付诸实行，那又是什么“主义”呢？
