Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 7th — The inspiration for new fashion designs from the "Sacred Flame" of the 11th Asian Games, the preference for loose, relaxed, and naturally elegant clothing with a touch of exotic charm, and the nostalgia for the traditional attire of the 1950s, full of vigor and masculinity, will shape the trends in China's spring and summer fashion for 1990.

This information was released today in Shanghai by Zhu Bingchen, Director of the China Fashion Research and Design Center.

The "Chinese Fashion Trends" project, designated as a national research topic, aims to guide production based on the needs of both international and domestic markets and to promote moderate and civilized consumption suitable for China's national conditions and ethnic characteristics. The China Fashion Research and Design Center, responsible for this research task, believes that the fashion trends in China for spring and summer 1990 will be composed of four main themes:

First is the "Asian Games Spirit." This type of clothing will use bright and vibrant colors such as orange, national flag red, deep blue, violet, deep green, and yellow. The silhouettes will feature short tops paired with short or long bottoms, mainly in the form of sportswear, jeans, and jackets. The waist will be accentuated with techniques like inlays, embellishments, rolls, and yin-yang stitching. Paired with sports shoes, hats, and socks, these outfits will exude a comfortable, convenient, and healthy style. Through daily wear, they will enhance the atmosphere of the Asian Games, encourage physical exercise, and improve health.

Second is the "Fifties Revival." Inspired by the attire of the 1950s, characterized by hard work and high spirits, this type of clothing will be dignified, simple, and practical. The color palette and fabric choices will be much richer than in the past. Popular colors will include wine red, rust red, coffee, indigo, slate blue, and misty gray. Fabrics like washed denim, polyester-cotton blends, satin, and non-cotton materials will be widely used. The styles will include various lengths of tops paired with long pants, long skirts, straight-leg pants, and wide-leg pants. Simple, clean lines will also be popular. The long jacket with short bottoms from the 1950s, along with the long H-shaped silhouette of the Mao suit and Lenin suit, will inspire new fashion trends in the 1990s. Double-breasted styles will be the foundation for the magical combination of metal buttons in the 1990s.

Third is the "Natural Charm." The natural environment always provides eternal inspiration. People's yearning for the harmony and purity of nature, and their desire to return to simplicity, will make natural colors like wheat yellow, straw yellow, stubble yellow, and field green, as well as rough-textured fabrics like woven and pleated patterns, highly sought after. The silhouettes will be loose, natural, and simple, with no collars or sleeves, or dropped shoulders. Delicate lace trimmings will be used for decoration, paired with straw hats, bamboo hats, embroidered belts, and woven shoes, exuding a strong sense of ethnic charm.

Fourth is the "Exotic Elegance." Using fabrics with a sense of suspension and fluidity, such as crepe, satin, lace, Oxford cloth, Bali silk, and organza, these outfits will feature pyramid-shaped and umbrella-shaped wide skirts and suspender pants. The color palette will be dominated by subtle, elegant neutral tones. This type of clothing will have a dynamic beauty, exuding a carefree style, blending international trends with national traditional dressing habits, making women's figures more curvaceous and elegant.

    我国明年春夏服装流行趋势公布
    “亚运风采”增气氛　“五零新风”显传统
    “自然风情”求纯真　“异国风雅”添娇美
    新华社上海10月7日电　（记者吴复民）灵感来自第十一届亚运会“圣火”的新款时装的诞生，对宽松、洒脱、洋溢着自然风情和异国风雅的时装的崇尚，以及对50年代意气风发、富有男性味的传统着装的怀念，将构成我国1990年春夏季服装的流行趋势。
    这一信息是中国服装研究设计中心主任朱秉臣今天在上海向新闻界发布的。
    被列为国家级科研课题的“中国服装流行趋势”，旨在从国际和国内两个市场的需要出发指导生产，并引导人们根据中国国情和民族性适度文明消费。承担这一科研任务的中国服装研究设计中心认为，1990年春夏，我国服装流行趋势将由四大主题组成：
    一是“亚运风采”。这类服装将采用桔黄、国旗红、深蓝、紫罗兰、深绿、黄等鲜艳明快的色调，服装廓型为短上衣配短下装或长下装，多为运动便服、牛仔和茄克式样，腰部用镶、嵌、滚、阴阳拼接等装饰手法稍加强调，配以运动鞋、帽、袜，具有舒适、方便、健美的风格。通过人们日常穿着将强化亚运会气氛，激励人们锻炼身体，增强体质。
    二是“五零新风”。灵感来自50年代艰苦创业、斗志昂扬的着装风貌。这类庄重、朴素、实用的新传统装，色彩和面料之丰富都非昔日可比。流行色彩为葡萄酒红、铁锈红、咖啡、靛蓝、石板蓝、烟雾灰。水洗布、涤麻、府绸、非棉织物将是广泛采用的新装面料。服装款型为各种长、短上衣配长裤、长裙、直筒裤、萝卜裤。长上衣配短下装的简洁造型也将受到青睐。50年代中山装、列宁装的长H型造型特点，还将成为90年代服装时髦组合的最新启迪，双排扣形式是90年代金属钮扣神奇组合的基础。
    三是“自然风情”。自然生态环境总是给人类以永恒的启迪。由于人们向往大自然的和谐纯真、追求返朴归真的心理，大自然中的黄绿色，包括大麦黄、麦秆黄、麦茬黄、田野绿，以及席纹、编织纹绉类等有粗糙感的松结构面料，都为人们所崇尚。服装廓型宽松，自然，简练，无领无袖或落肩，用精致的透空花边装饰，配以草帽斗笠、有绣花装饰的腰带及编织鞋，富有浓郁的民族气息。
    四是“异国风雅”。采用有悬垂、飘逸感的面料，如绉类、缎类、透空花边、牛津纺、巴厘纱、蝉翼纱等，制成呈金字塔型及伞型的大裙裤、背带裤，颜色以含蓄、优雅的中性色调为主。这类服装有律动美感，显出潇洒的风格，汇国际潮流与民族传统穿着习惯为一体，将使女性曲线玲珑，更添娇美。
