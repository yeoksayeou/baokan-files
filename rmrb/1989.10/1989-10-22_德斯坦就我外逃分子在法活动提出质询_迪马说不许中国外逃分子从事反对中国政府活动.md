In the French National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on October 18, it was reported that former French President and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Valéry Giscard d'Estaing raised questions about Chinese fugitives' political activities in France to Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.

D'Estaing asked whether France continues to adhere to its traditional policy of not allowing political activities by those granted asylum in France, in the context of France's relations with the People's Republic of China. Dumas replied that France has not changed its policy towards political refugees. As a country providing asylum and refuge, France does not allow political activities against governments with which France has diplomatic relations on its territory.

Observers here have noted that some Chinese fugitives continue to engage in anti-China government activities in France.

    新华社巴黎10月21日电  在法国国民议会外交事务委员会10月18日的听证会上，据悉法国前总统、外交事务委员会主席德斯坦就中国外逃分子在法国从事政治活动一事向外交部长罗朗·迪马提出质询。
    德斯坦问，在法国同中华人民共和国关系方面，法国是否继续执行历来对在法国受庇护者实行的传统规定，即受庇护者不得在法国领土上从事政治活动？迪马答称，法国没有改变对政治避难者的做法。法国作为庇护地和接纳地，不允许在其领土上进行反对与法国有外交关系的政府的政治活动。
    此间观察家注意到，一些中国外逃分子在法国进行的反对中国政府的活动至今仍在继续。
