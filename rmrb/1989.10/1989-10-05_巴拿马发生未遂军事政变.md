Panama Experiences Failed Military Coup

	According to local television reports, a failed military coup occurred in Panama today. By the afternoon, the situation was under control by troops loyal to General Manuel Noriega. The Panamanian government has declared a state of emergency.

	This morning, gunfire erupted in Panama City as mid-level officers attempted to overthrow the iron-fisted General Manuel Noriega. The coup forces seized the headquarters of the National Defense Forces and engaged in fierce exchanges of fire with troops loyal to Noriega. At noon, the coup forces, from a seized radio station, issued a statement declaring the coup successful, demanding Noriega's retirement, and calling for new elections under the supervision of the Organization of American States to form a provisional government.

	However, Noriega quickly mobilized elite units such as the "2000" Battalion to surround the headquarters and nearby police stations. After five hours of gun battles and negotiations, the coup plotters laid down their weapons and surrendered. By evening, the National Defense Forces announced the suppression of the rebellion and control of the situation. Noriega also appeared on television, accusing the United States of orchestrating the coup to disrupt Panama's peace.

	This is the second coup attempt in Panama in two years and three months of political crisis. Last March, a group of officers led by Police Chief Colonel Luis Córdoba attempted an unsuccessful coup against Noriega. Over the past two years, the U.S. government and the Southern Command stationed in the Panama Canal Zone have exploited the opposition's anti-Noriega struggle, repeatedly inciting them to overthrow the Noriega-controlled government.

	Currently, the political situation in Panama is tense. The U.S. military has declared the highest state of alert. The Panamanian Ministry of the Interior has announced a state of emergency starting today.

    巴拿马发生未遂军事政变
    综合本报加拉加斯、墨西哥城10月4日电　记者朱满庭、郭伟成报道：据当地电视台报道，巴拿马今天上午发生一起未遂军事政变，到下午，局势已处于忠于诺列加将军的部队控制之下。巴拿马政府已宣布实行戒严。
    今天早晨，巴拿马城突然枪声大作，一些中级军官发动了企图推翻铁腕人物诺列加将军的政变。政变部队占领了国防军总司令部，同忠于诺列加的部队进行了激烈的交火。中午，政变部队在占领的电台发表一项声明，宣称政变成功，要求诺列加退休，在美洲国家组织监督下举行新的大选，成立临时政府。
    但诺列加紧急调动“2000年”营等精锐部队包围了总司令部和附近的警察驻地。经过5小时的枪战和喊话交涉，政变分子放下武器投降。傍晚时分国防军宣布挫败兵变，控制了局势。诺列加将军也在电视屏幕上出现，他指责美国策动这次政变，破坏巴拿马安宁。
    这是巴拿马爆发政治危机2年零3个月来发生的第二次政变。去年3月，以警察司令马西亚斯上校为首的一批军官曾发动一起反对诺列加的未遂军事政变。近2年来，美国政府和驻扎在巴拿马运河区的南方司令部，利用巴拿马反对党反诺列加的斗争，多次鼓动他们起来推翻诺列加控制的政权。
    目前巴拿马政局紧张，美军已宣布进入最高级戒备状态。巴拿马内政部宣布从今天起实行戒严。
