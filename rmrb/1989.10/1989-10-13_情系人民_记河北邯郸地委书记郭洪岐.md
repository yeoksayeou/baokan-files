At first glance, he appears stern, but in reality, he is like a burning flame. Locals who are experts in their fields regard him as a mentor and friend, while ordinary people call him "Clean Secretary," and some even refer to him as "Iron-Faced Judge Bao."

He is Guo Hongqi, the Secretary of the Handan Municipal Committee in Hebei Province.

Four years ago, Guo Hongqi was transferred from the provincial level to Handan Region to serve as the Administrative Chief. At that time, the office and living conditions were quite poor, and a temporary room was hastily arranged for him to stay.

This room was dark and damp, with no sunlight throughout the day. The Secretary of the Administrative Office felt a bit embarrassed and said, "You can stay here for now."

Guo Hongqi, however, smiled and said, "It's fine, it's fine!" Four years have passed, and the Municipal Committee and the Administrative Office have built more than ten buildings for housing. Most of the cadres and staff have moved into spacious and bright new homes, but he still lives in that small room. The office has tried several times to persuade him to change his residence, but he has firmly refused each time.

Guo Hongqi's room is furnished with an old-fashioned hard bed that takes up one-third of the space. Opposite the bed is a desk with peeling paint, on which sits a 12-inch black-and-white television. In the corner of the room is a worn-out sofa from the 1950s. Many people find it hard to believe that the owner of this room is an official overseeing 13 counties and leading a population of 5 million.

This year in April, the office planned to renovate his room, but Guo Hongqi quickly declined, saying, "I don't have the time, let's talk about it later." Half a year has passed, and the renovation plan has still not been implemented.

Once, a bureau-level leader visited him and saw that he was still using a black-and-white television. Feeling guilty, the leader wanted to borrow a color TV from the office's remaining stock for him to use. However, when the idea was mentioned to his staff, it was immediately rejected. They knew that if they agreed, they would be scolded.

Guo Hongqi has been working in Handan for over four years and has always insisted on eating in the large canteen. He enjoys meals of corn porridge, black bread, and dishes from the communal kitchen, saying, "This food is very delicious."

In January of this year, Guo Hongqi became the Secretary of the Handan Municipal Committee. The Commander and Political Commissar of the Military Sub-region visited him sincerely, saying, "Now you are the first secretary of the Military Sub-region's Party Committee. Moving to our side will improve your living and working conditions." They also said that they had already prepared a residence for him.

Guo Hongqi smiled and said, "I appreciate your kindness, but I will just visit you more often in the future."

Guo Hongqi works diligently. He never lets his office staff draft speeches for him. In the first half of this year, he reviewed over 500 letters from the masses and nearly 100 documents, writing approximately 20,000 words of comments. In August, he spent 12 days in the countryside and counties investigating and solving problems, 4 days attending meetings outside, 7 days attending meetings in the office, and 7.5 days in the office handling documents, receiving visitors, and dealing with daily affairs.

His family is in Shijiazhuang, and his wife has been ill for many years. This month, he only returned home for half a day during a trip to attend a meeting and has not rested on a single Sunday.

When Guo Hongqi was the Administrative Chief, he promoted competitive contracting on a large scale, which quickly turned around the economy of Handan Region, helping the finances out of a difficult situation. This "competitive contracting" experience was fully affirmed by the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

Four years ago, under Guo Hongqi's advocacy, Handan Region overcame financial difficulties and allocated a significant amount of funds to strengthen agricultural infrastructure, making agricultural production improve year by year. Last year, it reached a historical high, and this summer saw new breakthroughs.

Guo Hongqi also strives to explore new paths in personnel system reforms, breaking through the network of relationships, resisting the influence of personal connections, and promoting the best talents. He has been commended by the National Ministry of Labor and Personnel.

    情系人民
    ——记河北邯郸地委书记郭洪岐
    李如志
    看上去，他显得严肃，其实，他似一团火。当地学有专长的人把他视为良师益友，普通百姓称他“清”书记，也有人叫他“铁面包公”。
    他就是河北邯郸地委书记郭洪岐。
    四年前，郭洪岐从省里调到邯郸地区任行署专员。那时，办公条件和居住条件都很差，临时为他挤出一间房子当宿舍。
    这间房子阴暗潮湿，一天到晚见不到阳光。行署秘书长有些不好意思地说：“权且住着吧”。
    郭洪岐却笑着说：“蛮好，蛮好！”四年过去了，地委和行署前后盖了十几栋宿舍，绝大部分干部职工搬进了宽敞明亮的新居，而他仍然住在那间小屋里。机关几次动员他换一换房，都被他坚决拒绝了。
    郭洪岐的那间宿舍，一张旧式硬板床占去了1／3空间，那张油漆已经脱落的办公桌放在床的对面，桌上放着一台12英寸黑白电视机，墙角放着一个五十年代生产的破旧沙发。许多人不相信住在这间房子的主人竟是管辖13个县、领导500万人口的官员。
    今年4月，机关准备给他装修房屋，郭洪岐连忙推辞说：“没有时间，以后再说吧。”如今半年过去了，装修的计划仍未落实。
    有一位局级领导去拜访他，看到他用的还是黑白电视机，心里很过意不去，便想从机关剩余的彩电中借一台给他看，便先将想法告诉他身边的工作人员，没想到被一口拒绝。因为知道，答应下来是会挨批评的。
    郭洪岐到邯郸工作4年多了，一直坚持在大食堂就餐，小米稀饭、玉米粥、黑面馍、大锅菜，他说：“这饭吃得很香”。
    今年1月郭洪歧担任了邯郸的地委书记，军分区的司令员、政委一起找到他，诚心诚意地说：“你现在是军分区的党委第一书记，搬到我们那边吃住条件好一些，又可以方便工作。”并说已经为他准备好了宿舍。
    郭洪岐笑笑说：“你们的心我领了，往后我多往你们那里去就行了。”
    郭洪岐干工作兢兢业业。他从不让办公室的同志为他起草讲话。今年上半年，他批阅500多封群众来信和近百份文件，写下约两万字的批语。今年8月他下乡、下县调查情况解决问题12天，外出开会4天，在机关开会7天，在机关处理文件、接待来访，处理日常事务7.5天。
    他家在石家庄，老伴常年有病，这个月他仅利用外出开会时机回家呆了半天，连一个星期天也没有休息过。
    郭洪岐担任专员时，大面积推行竞争承包，使邯郸地区经济很快出现转机，财政摆脱困境。这个“竞争承包”经验还得到党中央和国务院的充分肯定。
    4年前，在郭洪岐的倡导下，邯郸地区克服财政紧张的困难，拨出较大款项来加强农业基础方面的建设，使区农业生产一年上一个台阶，去年创历史最高水平，今年夏季又有新突破。
    郭洪岐还努力探索人事制度改革新路，打破关系网，顶住人情风，任人唯贤，使有用之才脱颖而出，受到国家劳动人事部的表扬。
