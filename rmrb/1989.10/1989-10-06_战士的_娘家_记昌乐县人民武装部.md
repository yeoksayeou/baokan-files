The Changle County People's Armed Forces Department in Shandong Province frequently receives letters from local soldiers, praising them as "hometown people with a mother's heart."

One day after the Spring Festival, Qi Ruoyao, the political commissar of the Changle County People's Armed Forces Department, received a letter from a local soldier named Tang Lianshun. The letter mentioned that his family and three other military families in the village had not received their preferential treatment. After reading the letter, Qi felt guilty: how could soldiers be at ease on the front lines if they had worries at home? It was the duty of the "hometown people" to help them solve their problems! That same day, he drove to Tang Lianshun's village to investigate. He visited Tang's parents and discussed measures with the village cadres. The preferential treatment was quickly implemented. Qi wrote a letter to Tang, informing him that the problem had been solved and urging him to serve his duty with peace of mind. Later, Qi reported this situation to the county party secretary. The county party secretary asked, "Are there similar situations in other places?" The two of them visited four townships to investigate and comfort the military families. Upon returning to the county, they convened a meeting of county committee and county government department heads to discuss how to further improve the work of supporting the military and caring for military families.

In the conference room of the Changle County People's Armed Forces Department, a party committee meeting was in progress. Suddenly, a soldier with a worried expression entered and recounted the following incident: his father was an honest and kind-hearted man who had exposed the village head's improper conduct. The village head held a grudge. One time, the village head, under the influence of alcohol, picked a fight and beat the soldier's father and sister. The soldier, after receiving the letter, requested leave to return home and rely on the organization to handle the matter.

After hearing the soldier's account, the party committee immediately studied and formulated measures, and promptly reported to the county committee leaders; the next day, a joint investigation team, led by the county People's Armed Forces Department and including public security, procuratorate, and judicial departments, went to the soldier's hometown. They held a discussion with the village cadres, interviewed the parties involved, and visited the soldier's father and sister.

The investigation results showed that the soldier's report was true. The investigation team, together with the township party committee, severely criticized the village head and made a fair decision.

As early as the second year of the army's work on cultivating dual-purpose talents, the Changle County People's Armed Forces Department continuously received letters from local soldiers inquiring about the demand for talents in their hometown. The department leaders, after reading letter after letter, instructed the political work department to design talent information cards. The People's Armed Forces Department also took various measures to collect information.

The People's Armed Forces Department established a talent information group to analyze and organize information and fill out information cards.

By the eve of this year's August 1st, more than 4,400 copies of "Hometown Dual-Purpose Talent Demand Information" cards had been sent to local soldiers, providing more than 700 pieces of information. This not only answered the soldiers' questions but also strongly supported the army's work on cultivating dual-purpose talents.

    战士的“娘家”
    ——记昌乐县人民武装部
    陈占法
    山东省昌乐县人民武装部不断接到本县籍战士的来信，夸赞他们是“娘家人，慈母心”。
    春节后的一天，昌乐县人武部政委齐若瑶收到本县籍战士唐连顺的来信。信中说他家和本村3户军属的优待项目没有落实。齐政委看罢信深感内疚：战士有后顾之忧，怎能在前方安心？为他们排忧解难，是“娘家”人义不容辞的责任啊！当天，他驱车赶到唐连顺家所在村调查。走访了唐连顺的父母，并同村干部一起研究措施，优待项目很快落实了。齐政委给唐连顺去信，告诉他问题已解决，嘱咐他安心服役。随后，齐政委把这一情况报告了县委书记。县委书记说，类似情况在其他地方是否也存在呢？他俩到4个乡镇的军属家庭调查、慰问，回到县里召开了县委、县政府有关部门负责人会议，专题研究如何进一步搞好拥军优属工作。
    昌乐县人武部会议室里正开党委会，突然走进一位满脸忧郁的战士，诉说了这样一件事：他父亲是正直憨厚的人，因揭露过村主任的不正之风，村主任耿耿于怀。一次，村主任借酒兴寻衅，把战士的父亲和妹妹打了。战士接到家信后，请假回来依靠组织处理。
    听了战士的诉说，党委会当即研究解决措施，并及时向县委领导汇报；随后成立了以县人武部为主，公、检、法等有关部门参加的联合调查组，于第二天到战士家所在乡，同村干部们座谈，找当事人了解情况，并看望那位战士的父亲和妹妹。
    调查结果表明：那位战士反映的问题属实。调查组会同乡党委对那位村主任进行了严肃批评，作出了公正处理。
    早在部队开展培养两用人才工作的第二年，昌乐县人武部不断收到本县籍战士来信，询问家乡人才需求情况，部领导看了一封封来信，让政工科设计了人才信息卡片。人武部还采取多种措施搜集信息。
    人武部还成立了人才信息小组、负责分析、整理信息，填写信息卡片。
    到今年“八一”前夕，已给本县籍战士发去4400多份《家乡两用人才需求信息》卡片，共提供700多条信息，不仅解答了战士们的疑问，也有力地支持了部队培养两用人才工作。
