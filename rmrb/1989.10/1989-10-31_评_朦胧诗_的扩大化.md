In the early 1980s, contemporary Chinese poetry saw the emergence of new poems that many readers found difficult to understand or even incomprehensible. These poems were criticized as "strange poetry" or "misty poetry." The debate over these so-called difficult or incomprehensible "misty poems" was intense, with critics wanting to dismiss them and supporters wanting to elevate them. The opposition was severe. The peak of the debate lasted only a few months, with the "critics" seemingly gaining the upper hand. In the latter half of 1984 to the first half of 1985, the literary world opposed bourgeois liberalization and spiritual pollution, temporarily halting the debate. However, with the development of the reform and opening-up policy, "misty poetry" was mentioned by some foreign poets, leading to the resurgence of the "supporters." Some young poets became intoxicated and, in 1986, produced poems even more difficult to understand than those of the so-called "emerging poets" of the early 1980s. They also sought novelty and formed numerous clubs and schools. For a time, schools of poetry flourished, numbering over a hundred. They believed that with a population exceeding one billion, 100 or more poetry schools were not too many. They competed to display their banners, with names like "Third Generation," "New Generation," "New Poetry Tide," "Post-Emerging," "Avant-Garde," and various other obscure "isms" such as "Non-Nonism," "Twilightism," "Rusticism," and so on, leaving people bewildered and confused.

I have no intention of reigniting the debate over "misty poetry" or "exploratory poetry," nor do I plan to introduce the arguments of both sides in detail. I will only briefly outline the context for the sake of convenience, inevitably omitting some points.

I believe that whether poetry is "strange" or "misty," it can be seen as an artistic style. From the perspective of poetry development, the more styles there are, the more it indicates that poetry is developing and progressing. If styles are uniform, it is likely that the poet's artistic individuality is beginning to wither and solidify. To promote the prosperity of poetry, we should not overly focus on whether poetry is difficult to understand or not. We should look at whether these difficult or incomprehensible poems have unique styles. What is concerning is that some participants in the debate seem unaware of the need to add more styles to socialist new poetry. Instead, they focus all their energy on advocating for the so-called "misty poetry" to gain orthodox status, trying to transform its derogatory connotation from the early 1980s into a complimentary one, and striving for a dominant position in contemporary poetry. Consequently, they adopt a cold and dismissive attitude towards the majority of traditional new poetry since the May Fourth Movement, which has been widely appreciated, considering it outdated and in need of renewal. This exclusivity in advocating for the dominant position of "misty poetry" is expanding rapidly.

First, there is the expansion of the concept, where some young poets' non-misty poems are indiscriminately classified as "misty poetry." If we view so-called "misty poetry" as one of the many poetic styles that emerged in the new era, I believe "misty poetry" should not be indiscriminately rejected, but we need to clarify the concept of "misty poetry." I recall Song Dynasty poet Mei Yaochen's view on poetry: "To describe what is difficult to write, as if it were right before one's eyes; to express what cannot be fully conveyed, as if it were implied between the lines." This means that landscape poetry should depict mountains, rivers, flowers, and birds vividly, as if they were right before the reader's eyes. As for lyric poetry, it should not express emotions too openly but should allow the reader to feel the deep and endless emotions hidden between the lines. This actually views landscape poetry and lyric poetry as two different styles of expression: clarity and subtlety. Based on this, is the difficulty or incomprehensibility of "misty poetry" due to "expressing what cannot be fully conveyed, as if it were implied between the lines"? According to the "critics," "misty poetry" is difficult and incomprehensible "strange poetry," and the poet's creative intent is hard to grasp from the language. If this is true, it is not "expressing what cannot be fully conveyed, as if it were implied between the lines," but rather "expressing what cannot be fully conveyed, as if it were a surprise," leaving the reader to guess the meaning.

I believe that the repeated debates over "misty poetry" have not clarified the concept for either the "supporters" or the "critics." The "supporters" consider some young poets' relatively subtle poems as "misty poetry." Even some poets of the "emerging generation" are not misty, and Shu Ting's poems are mostly not misty. It is the works of some even younger poets that truly feel misty and obscure. Their poems become increasingly difficult, seemingly requiring such difficulty to distinguish themselves from the slightly earlier "emerging generation" and earn titles like "post-emerging," "avant-garde," "new generation," and so on, to show their superiority. In reality, some of their poems are not "misty poetry" with implied meanings beyond the lines, but because some interpreters have unclear concepts and do not distinguish between different types, they indiscriminately label them as "misty poetry." Once the concept is expanded, it truly becomes "unnamed, unsaid," as if the entire realm of poetry is filled with "misty poetry"!

Second, there is the expansion of the "misty poetry" group, where poets who do not write "misty poetry" are expanded into "misty poets." This expansion leads to confusion in the evaluation of some representative poets in modern Chinese literature. For example, the elderly poet Ai Qing not only did not write "misty poetry" but was one of the earliest to point out the ambiguity of "misty poetry." However, a popular book on "misty poetry" included Ai Qing's poems, implying: "You oppose 'misty poetry'? But your own poems are 'misty poetry'!" In fact, the selected poem by Ai Qing, written in the spring of 1940, "A Tree," simply states that in a forest, trees appear separate, but their roots are intertwined underground. This is a metaphor for the Chinese people during the war of resistance, who, though scattered like trees, are united like tree roots against the enemy. The meaning is clear, and labeling it as "misty poetry" is unjust! As for the book's inclusion of poems by Li Jinfa, Xu Zhimo, Dai Wangshu, Hu Yepin, He Qifang, Xian Yu, Feng Wenbing (Ming Fei), Xin Di, and others, it further expands the "misty poetry" group to include a large number of elderly, middle-aged, and young poets. The "critics" naturally disagree, and even the "supporters" may not be entirely satisfied. The "critics" disagree because this confuses the creative paths and artistic individuality of some elderly poets, leading researchers to confusion and inability to accurately evaluate them. As for the "supporters," they may not be entirely satisfied because "misty poetry" emerged only in the early 1980s and was called "the rise of a new aesthetic principle." They consider themselves the "emerging generation" precisely because they distance or break away from the new poetry tradition since the May Fourth Movement to rise as a new force. Now, with the interpreters' mixed compilation, they not only implicitly cancel the "new aesthetic principle" that distinguishes "misty poetry" from new poetry since the May Fourth Movement but also move the "rise of a new aesthetic principle" back to the early 1920s with Li Jinfa. By following Li Jinfa, Dai Wangshu, and others, there is nothing new to speak of! Thus, the so-called "new generation," "new poetry tide," "post-emerging," "post-new poetry tide," "postmodernism," and other honorable titles are all reduced to nothing in both creative practice and theoretical construction!

Third, there is the expansion of time, where "misty poetry" that emerged in the 1980s and whose debate is unresolved is expanded to various periods of modern literature. This is a necessary trend of the expansion of the "misty poetry" group. However, poets are people, not flowers. Although "flowers are the same year after year," people are "different year after year." The interpreters of "misty poetry" only know that "misty poetry" is difficult to understand but do not realize that difficult poems are not necessarily "misty poetry." They indiscriminately compile difficult poems from different eras as "misty poetry," forgetting that poets and their poems are influenced and constrained by the social atmosphere of different eras, their own life experiences, and creative paths. This clearly erases the historical characteristics of the times and the artistic individuality of poets. This is a serious case of black and white confusion and right and wrong disorder in the history of the emergence and development of Chinese new poetry! More intolerable is that some monographs and papers even expand the era of "misty poetry" to ancient times, as if "misty poetry" has been passed down since ancient times. It is true that Qu Yuan's "Tianwen" is difficult to understand and even incomprehensible, but can it be called "misty poetry"? Li Shangyin's "Untitled" poems are also difficult to understand or incomprehensible, but can they be called "misty poetry"? We have said that the "misty poetry" that emerged in the 1980s, if truly written reasonably, as the Song Dynasty female poet Zhu Shuzhen said: "Misty dawn envelops spring colors, making spring light seem different," the "misty" truly contains charm. Possessing a "misty" style, it can become an object of aesthetic appreciation, and it is certain that it has a different "subtle" "misty" style. However, if its time is expanded to ancient times, it is another expansion, that is, due to the expansion of time, the "misty poetry" is expanded from the "misty" style to the "misty" form. From the already published "misty poetry" selections and some dictionaries, this practice of expanding style to form seems to have become or is about to become a fait accompli.

Fourth, there is the expansion of space, where "misty poetry" that emerged in the 1980s on the mainland is expanded to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even overseas, viewing modern poetry popular in Taiwan and Hong Kong as "misty poetry," indicating that "misty poetry" is not only a style but also a form, not only present on the mainland but also in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Including dozens of senior poets from Taiwan and Hong Kong in the poetry of some mainland young people who call themselves "new generation" or "avant-garde," although they have been influenced by some poets from Taiwan and Hong Kong, due to being isolated for decades or even over a century, there are many obvious differences in poetic conception, language use, and artistic expression. The interpreters also label the modern poetry of poets from Taiwan and Hong Kong as "misty poetry," which is somewhat inappropriate.

The expansion of space is not limited to Taiwan and Hong Kong. It is said that some people believe that "misty poetry" exists not only on the mainland and in Taiwan and Hong Kong but also abroad. "Misty poetry" is simply becoming a misty typhoon, sweeping the globe and overwhelming the world. If this is true, it is astonishing.

I am not absolutely against "misty poetry." On the contrary, I have always appreciated the "misty beauty" style of poetry. I have no criticism for those who write, appreciate, and publish "misty poetry." I just believe that "misty poetry" is still in the period of debate and discussion and should not be expanded. Our goal should be to establish a style of "misty beauty" different from the general so-called "subtle beauty," as one of the channels for innovation in new poetry, standing on an equal footing with other styles, and striving to achieve the diversity of new poetry styles in the socialist era. Therefore, I want to appeal once again: "Farewell to 'misty poetry,' cherish 'misty beauty'." That is, "misty poetry" should not be expanded as a form of poetry, but "misty beauty" can exist and be promoted as a poetic style that emerged in the specific period of the 1980s, but not expanded to the poetic realm of other times and spaces. For this, I suggest that poetry critics or enthusiasts of so-called "misty poetry" work together to examine the works and styles of contemporary young poets:

1. Explore the fundamental differences between the "misty beauty" style of contemporary "misty poetry" and the "subtle beauty" style of traditional poetry, so that the "misty beauty" style does not slide towards "subtle beauty" and can gain its own independent space.

2. After finding the independence of the "misty beauty" style, determine that "misty poetry" is only the "misty beauty" style and not a form of poetry, to avoid confusion with independent forms of poetry such as lyric poetry, narrative poetry, free verse, and formal poetry.

3. Fully discuss whether the "misty beauty" style that emerged in the 1980s, which may exist independently, has a "qualitative" difference from the symbolic poetry and modern poetry that have been popular since the Cultural Revolution, as well as the modern poetry style in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the West? Is it only superficially "similar in form" but not "similar in spirit"?

Only after clarifying the above three points can we judge the essence of the debate over "misty poetry" in the mid-1980s and then decide whether the "supporters" and "critics" should continue to debate or ceasefire and work together to promote the prosperity of socialist poetry.

　　评“朦胧诗”的扩大化
　　吴奔星
    80年代初期，当代诗坛出现一些为一般读者认为难懂甚至不懂的新诗，被人斥责为
  “怪诗”或“朦胧体”诗。关于所谓难懂或不懂的“朦胧”诗，引出一场或贬与或褒的争论：贬之者要将它打翻在地，褒之者要将它捧之上天。双方的对立是严峻的。争论的高峰期不过几个月，似乎“贬派”占了上风。适逢1984年下半年到1985年上半年，文艺界反对资产阶级自由化、清除精神污染，双方暂停论辩。但随着改革开放的形势发展，“朦胧”诗为个别外国诗人所提及，从而“褒派”复起，陶醉了某些青年诗人，于1986年纷纷抛出一些比80年代初期的所谓
  “崛起派”诗人更为难懂的诗作，并且标新立异、出现名目繁多的社团、流派。一时之间，流派蜂起，不下百十来个。他们认为中国人口超过十亿，100多个诗歌流派并不算多。他们竞相亮出旗号，或曰“第三代”、或曰“新生代”、或曰“新诗潮”、或曰“后崛起”、或曰“先锋派”、还有什么“非非主义”、“黄昏主义”、“莽汉主义”……等莫测高深的许多“主义”，令人眼花缭乱、记忆模糊。
    我丝毫无意重新挑起关于“朦胧诗”或“探索诗”的是是非非的论辩，因而对论争的双方也不拟详加介绍，只是为了行文的方便，略述梗概，难免挂一漏万。
    我认为，诗的“怪”也罢，“朦胧”也罢，都可以作为艺术风格看待。从诗的发展看，风格越多，表明诗在发展、在前进。如果风格单一，就很有可能是诗人的艺术个性在开始萎缩、开始凝固。为了诗风的昌盛，我们不应过分纠缠于诗的字面的难懂与不懂上，要看那些难懂或不懂的诗是否有独特的风格。令人担心的是，某些参与争论的同志似乎并未意识到要为社会主义的新诗增多风格，而将全副的精力，放在为所谓“朦胧”诗争取正统的地位上，要把它从80年代初期的“贬义”，想方设法转化为“褒义”，争取当代诗坛的主流地位，从而对“五四”以来大部分为人喜闻乐见的传统新诗，采取疏离、排斥、不屑一顾的冷漠态度，认为其体格与风格都已“陈旧”、“陈腐”，到了必须更新的时候了。这种为争取“朦胧”诗的主体地位而流露的排它性，骎骎然有扩大之势。
    首先，是概念的扩大化，把一些青年诗人写的并不朦胧的诗笼而统之地归入“朦胧”诗。如果把所谓“朦胧”诗作为新时期出现的众多“诗风”之一看待，我认为“朦胧”诗是不应毫无分析地加以排斥的，但须把“朦胧”诗的概念弄清楚。记得宋人梅圣俞论诗，诗应“状难写之景，如在目前；含不尽之意，见于言外。”就是说写景诗要把山水花鸟写得栩栩如生，就像呈现在读者的眼前一样。至于抒情诗就不要把感情抒发得太浅露，要让读者体会字里行间所蕴藏的缠绵不尽的情意。这实际把风景诗和抒情诗看成明朗和含蓄两种不同的风格的表现。据此，所谓“朦胧”诗的难懂或不懂是不是“含蓄”看不尽的情意呢？照“贬派”的意见，“朦胧”诗是难懂和不懂的“怪诗”，诗人的创作意图是难于从诗的语言捕捉的。果真这样，便不是“含不尽之意，见于言外”，而只能说是含不尽之意出人“意外”，让读者各凭己意去猜测了。
    我以为，关于“朦胧”诗的反复争论，“褒”“贬”两派都没有把概念弄清楚。“褒派”把青年写的一些比较含蓄的诗都当成了“朦胧”诗。即使是“崛起派”的某些诗人也并不朦胧，至于舒婷等人的诗，大多不是朦胧的。真正令人感到朦胧晦涩的，是一些比舒婷等更年轻的诗人的作品。他们写的诗难度越来越大，似乎非如此，不足以区别于略早于他们的“崛起派”，而博得“后崛起”、“先锋派”、“新生代”等等的称号，以示后来居上。实际上他们有一些诗，也并非都是含不尽之意出人意外的“朦胧”诗，只因某些赏析者概念不清，不分青红皂白，一律称之为“朦胧诗”。这样概念一扩大，真是所谓名不正，言不顺，似乎诗的领域无往而非“朦胧”诗了！
    第二，是“朦胧”诗人队伍的扩大化，把本非写“朦胧”诗的诗人扩大为“朦胧”诗人。这样一扩大就导致对中国现代某些代表诗人在评价上的混乱。例如，老诗人艾青不仅没有写过“朦胧”诗，而且是较早起来指出“朦胧”诗的含混不清。可是有一本专门赏析“朦胧”诗的通俗读物，偏偏把艾青的诗收入其中。其意若曰：你反对“朦胧”诗吗？你自己写的就是“朦胧”诗嘛！实际该书所选艾青写于1940年春天的《树》：“一棵树，一棵树／彼此孤立地兀立着／风与空气／告诉着它们的距离∥但是在泥土的覆盖下／它们的根伸长着／在看不见的深处／它们把根须纠缠在一起。”诗只是说，树林里的树，从一棵棵的看，虽有距离，但从泥土内部看，他们的根是纠缠在一起的。这只是诗人用以比喻抗战中的中国人民，表面看来像树一样分散，而他们扎根于祖国的泥土上，却是像树根一样团结对敌的。诗意明确得很，扣之以“朦胧诗”的帽子，岂非冤哉枉也？！至于该书把李金发、徐志摩、戴望舒、胡也频、何其芳、卞之琳、冯文炳
  （废名）、辛笛等人的诗，也都或多或少地收进去凑数，这样一来，本来写“朦胧”诗的只有少数青年人，却被扩大化为包括老中青在内的一支庞大的朦胧诗人队伍。对此，“贬派”固然不同意，“褒派”也未必都满意。“贬派”不同意，是因为这样一来就混淆了一些老诗人的创作道路与艺术个性，将导致研究者的思路混乱，不能对他们做出准确的评价。至于“褒派”未必都满意，是因为“朦胧诗”本是80年代初才出现的，被称为“新的美学原则的崛起”。他们其所以自封为“崛起派”，原因就是由于疏离或摆脱“五四”以来的新诗传统，为异军突起；现在经赏析者的混合编制，便不仅无形中取消了“朦胧”诗赖以区别于“五四”以来新诗的“新的美学原则”，而且把“新的美学原则的崛起”提早到20年代初期的李金发的时代去了；做了李金发、戴望舒等人的尾巴，便无新可言了！从而，所谓“新生代”、“新诗潮”、“后崛起”、
  “后新诗潮”、“后现代主义”……等等美名，无不从创作实践到理论建树全部化为乌有！
    第三，是时间的扩大化，把出现于80年代并且争论未决的“朦胧”诗，扩大到了现代文学的各个时期。这是上述朦胧诗人队伍的扩大化的必然趋向。但是诗人毕竟是人不是花。花虽然“年年岁岁花相似”，而人却“岁岁年年人不同”。赏析“朦胧”诗的同志只知“朦胧诗”难懂，而不知难懂的诗并非都是朦胧诗，把不同时代的难懂的诗笼统地编为“朦胧”诗，而忘了诗人及其诗是受不同时代的社会风气和各自不同的生活经历以及创作道路的影响与制约的。这就明显地抹煞掉了历史的时代特色和诗人的艺术个性。对中国新诗的发生、发展的历史，是何等严重的一次黑白不分与是非混乱！更难容忍的是，有些专著和论文还把“朦胧”诗的时代扩大化到古代，似乎“朦胧”诗是古已有之，一脉相承下来的。不错，屈原的《天问》是难懂的，甚至有些不可理解的，难道可以称之为“朦胧”诗吗？李商隐的
  《无题》诗也是令人难懂或不懂的，难道可以称之为
  “朦胧”诗吗？我们说过，出现于80年代的“朦胧”诗，如果真写得合乎情理，如宋朝女诗人朱淑真所说：“朦胧晓色笼春色，便觉春光不一般”，“朦胧”之中真正含有魅力。具有“朦胧”的风格，能成为审美对象，那是可以肯定它有不同于一般的“含蓄”的“朦胧”风格的，但是，假如把它的时间扩大到古代，那就未免又增加了一次扩大化，即由于时代的扩大化，捎带地把“朦胧”诗从“朦胧”的风格，扩大化为“朦胧”的诗体了。从现已出版的朦胧诗选和一些辞典看，这种把风格扩大为诗体的做法，似乎已经或将要成为既成事实了。
    第四，是空间的扩大。即把80年代出现于大陆的朦胧诗，扩大到台港甚至海外，把流行于台港的现代诗，视为朦胧诗，表明朦胧诗已不仅是一种风格，还是一种诗体，不仅大陆有，台湾和香港等地区也都有。把台港的数十位资深诗人包括在内大陆某些自称
  “新生代”或“先锋派”青年的诗，承受过台港诗人的某些影响，但毕竟由于隔绝数十年乃至百余年之久，在诗的构思上、语言运用上，乃至艺术表现上，都有许多明显的差异，赏析者把台港诗人的现代诗也冠以“朦胧诗”之名，未免有些欠妥。
    空间的扩大化，不仅仅及于台港，听说有人认为朦胧诗不但大陆有、台港有、外国也有。“朦胧诗”简直将变成一股朦胧的台风，刮遍全球，披靡天下。果真如此，令人叹为观止。
    我并非绝对地反对“朦胧诗”，相反，我是一向喜爱“朦胧美”的诗风的。我对于写作“朦胧诗”，赏析“朦胧诗”，出版“朦胧诗”的同志，毫无责难之意。我只是认为“朦胧诗”尚在争议时期，讨论时期，不宜扩大化。我们努力的目标，应该是建立一种区别于一般所谓“含蓄”的“朦胧美”的风格，作为新诗的创新的渠道之一，与其它的风格平起平坐，争取实现社会主义时代的新诗风格的多样性。因此，我要再一次的呼吁：“别了‘朦胧诗’，挽留‘朦胧美’”。即是说，所谓“朦胧诗”不能作为一种诗体去扩大化，但“朦胧美”却可作为80年代这个特定的时期所出现的诗风而存在，而推广，但不是“扩大化”到其它时空的诗的领域里去。为此，我建议诗评家或者关心所谓“朦胧诗”的热心人，共同来考辨当代青年诗人的诗作及其诗风：
    一、探讨当代“朦胧诗”的“朦胧美”的风格和传统诗的“含蓄美”的风格的根本差异，使“朦胧美”的诗风不致滑向“含蓄美”，而能取得自己独立生存的空间。
    二、在摸索到“朦胧美”诗风的独立性后，确定
  “朦胧诗”只是“朦胧美”的诗风，并非一种诗体，以免和抒情诗、叙事诗、自由诗、格律诗等独立的诗体混为一谈。
    三、充分研讨一下80年代出现的可能独立存在的“朦胧美”诗风，与“文化大革命”以来的象征派、现代派诗和流行于台港以及西方的现代派诗风，有无“质”的区别？是否只有表面的“形似”而无实质的“神似”？
    只有把上面三点弄清楚之后，才可判断80年代中期关于“朦胧诗”的辩论的实质，从而可以提出：是“褒贬”两派继续争辩好呢，还是断然休战，共同为繁荣社会主义的诗歌而努力好？
