In the spring when all trees are in full bloom, I accompanied a friend to the natural reserve of Mount Fanjing. Upon reaching the peak at an altitude of 2,492 meters, I saw that the surrounding mountains were lush and green, and the forest stretched endlessly, creating a boundless green world where the life of all things seemed to pulsate in the new greenery. The air was exceptionally fresh, and the entire mountain was full of vitality.

On the northern side of the Golden Summit, at the foot of the old mountain near the Dripping Rock, we discovered three stone steles. Upon closer inspection, the middle one was the "Imperial Stele," which was carved with a dragon soaring and clouds hovering above. It contained 1,349 characters, providing a concise account of Mount Fanjing's topography, scenic spots, historical changes, and the reconstruction of the Golden Summit.

However, the most valuable were the two "Steles Prohibiting the Felling of Forests" on either side of the "Imperial Stele." The one on the left was a proclamation by the Governor of Guizhou, Lin Qing, and the one on the right was a proclamation by the Governor of Guizhou, Li Wen Geng. Both steles were erected in the 12th year of the Daoguang reign.

The Lin Stele states: "This sacred mountain is strictly forbidden from felling trees and digging kilns to cultivate the wind and veins. It is known that the Fanjing Mountain in the jurisdiction of Tongren Prefecture has towering green mountains and solemn ancient temples. It is the source of the two great rivers and is indeed the guardian of several counties. It should be nurtured and protected. Those who reside here will all enjoy the blessings of peace."

The Li Stele states: "In the third year of Daoguang, due to the monks of the temple privately hiring rogues to fell trees in the mountain, open kilns, and burn charcoal for profit... Therefore, it is hereby announced to the monks of Fanjing Mountain and the local officials, soldiers, and civilians: From now on, all the forests, trees, and stones in the mountain and its surrounding areas must be inspected and protected at all times..."

Mount Fanjing has a forest area of over 290,700 hectares, with a forest coverage rate of 80%, and abundant forest resources. The variety of plant species is rich, making it a "green treasure trove." It is also a "natural water reservoir." Due to the intact forest vegetation, during rainy days, the forest canopy intercepts rainwater, preventing soil erosion; during clear days, the trees act like pumps, drawing water from the soil through their roots, stems, and leaves, slowly evaporating and releasing it into the air, making the surrounding air humid, forming a small climate cycle, and facilitating cloud formation and rainfall. Scientists have estimated that due to the forest coverage, Mount Fanjing stores approximately 80 million cubic meters of water in the soil, equivalent to a massive natural water reservoir. Due to the forest's regulation of the climate, the surrounding areas of Mount Fanjing receive abundant rainfall, ensuring good weather every year.

According to reports, in recent years, the felling of trees in the Mount Fanjing area has been severe. Some farmers have become wealthy by felling trees and selling them; some have sold off green mountains, felled trees, and burned charcoal; and some have intentionally destroyed the environment by setting fires to the mountains. There is even a bizarre saying: "To get rich, you must fell trees." The arrogance of those who steal and fell trees is so great that they dare to attack and even kill forest rangers. Although the local government has taken certain measures, the felling of trees continues unabated, and such incidents are becoming more frequent and severe. Mount Fanjing benefits humanity, and it is the merit of ancient people who protected the forests! Today's people should cherish and protect our country's mountains, rivers, and every blade of grass and tree even more than the ancients did!

    梵净山《禁砍山林碑》
    陈世海
    在万木争荣的春天，我随友人来到自然保护区梵净山。登上海拔2492米的绝顶，但见四周群峰耸翠，林海莽莽，一片无边无际的绿色世界，万物的生命仿佛在新绿中跳动。空气清新极了，全山充满了生机。
    在金顶北侧老山脚下滴水岩绿茸茸的芳草丛中，我们发现三块碑石。仔细辨认，中间一块是《敕赐碑》，碑上雕有腾龙拱护，上罩祥云。1349个字，对梵净山的地形地貌、名胜风光、历史沿革、重建金顶，作了简明扼要的叙述。
    然而，最有价值的，还要算《敕赐碑》两侧的《禁砍山林碑》。左边的为贵州巡抚麟庆的通告，右边一块为贵州承宣布政使司按察使李文耕的通告。两碑均立于清道光十二年。
    麟碑说：“灵山重地，严禁伐木掘窑，以培风脉事。照得铜仁府属梵净山，层峦耸翠，古刹庄严，为大小两江发源，实思铜数郡保障，自应培护。斯居其地者，咸享平安之福。”说出了保护森林关系到人类生存的重大意义。
    李碑说：“前于道光三年，因寺僧私招奸徒，在彼砍伐山林，开窑烧炭，从中渔利……为此，示仰梵净山寺僧及该地方乡保军民人等一体知悉：嗣后该山场及附近四周一切山林木石，务须随时稽查，妥为护蓄……”
    梵净山有森林面积290700多公顷，森林植被覆盖率达80％，森林资源十分丰富，植物种类繁多，是一座“绿色的宝库”。它又是一座“天然的水库”。由于森林植被保存完好，雨天，林冠截留雨水，保持水土不受流失；晴天，树木又像一台台“抽水机”，把土层里的水分通过树木的根、茎、叶，缓缓蒸发输送到空中，使周围空气湿润，形成气候小循环，易于成云降雨。据科学家推算，梵净山由于森林覆盖的作用，地层蓄积水分大约有8000万立方，相当于一座巨大的天然水库。由于森林调节气候，梵净山周围广大地区雨量充沛，年年风调雨顺。
    据报载，近年来，梵净山区砍树严重，区内有的农民靠砍树卖致富；有的变卖青山，砍树烧炭；有的蓄意破坏，放火烧山。有这样一种奇谈怪论：“要想富，就砍树。”偷砍树木的人气焰十分嚣张，护林员发现制止，他们竟敢行凶杀人。当地政府虽然采取了一定的措施，令行禁不止，砍伐树木的事件时有发生，且越演越烈。梵净山造福于人类，是古人保护森林之功！今人应比古人更加爱护祖国的山山水水、一草一木！
