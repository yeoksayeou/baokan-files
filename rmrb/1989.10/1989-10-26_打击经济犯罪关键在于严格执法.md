The Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin said today that the effectiveness of combating economic crimes hinges on strict law enforcement and adherence to legal procedures.

Ren Jianxin stated that the issue of "punishment instead of prosecution" remains significant. As a result, many serious economic crime cases that should be transferred to the people's courts for criminal prosecution are instead handled with administrative or economic penalties. This approach of "punishment instead of prosecution" has led to inadequate crackdowns on serious economic criminal activities, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the public. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have paid great attention to this issue and have called for measures to address it. We believe that any case constituting a crime, which by law requires criminal prosecution, should be prosecuted by the people's courts. No organization has the authority to handle such cases arbitrarily, and no one should substitute punishment for prosecution. We hope that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress will strengthen supervision and support in this regard. Some issues also involve legal amendments, and we suggest resolving them promptly.

He said that after the expiration of the "Notice" period, all levels of people's courts will continue to adhere to the policy of severely punishing those who seriously disrupt the economy, and continue to implement the policy of combining punishment with leniency, with leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist. The door to leniency for confession remains open. For those who surrender and perform meritorious service, as long as they meet the conditions stipulated in Article 63 of the Criminal Law, they will still be treated leniently or have their penalties reduced, and some may even be exempted from criminal punishment. However, the leniency will not be as extensive as stipulated in the "Notice." There are only a few days left until the "Notice" expires, and we still warn those who have committed crimes such as embezzlement, bribery, and speculation that they should seize the opportunity to surrender and confess, perform meritorious service, and seek leniency.

Ren Jianxin said that during the "Notice" period, cases of embezzlement, bribery, and speculation that were voluntarily surrendered or discovered will be prosecuted in large numbers in the future. Timely and correct handling of these cases is an important task for the people's courts this winter and the first half of next year. The people's courts will continue to apply the regulations of the "Notice" in handling these cases and will deal with them according to law.

### 打击经济犯罪关键在于严格执法

　　打击经济犯罪关键在于严格执法
    新华社北京10月25日电  最高人民法院院长任建新今天说，打击经济犯罪是否有力，关键在于能否严格执法，依法办事。
    任建新说，当前，“以罚代刑”的问题仍然相当严重，以致不少严重经济犯罪案件本应移送人民法院追究刑事责任，但有关部门只作行政处罚或经济处罚了事。这种“以罚代刑”的结果，造成了对一些严重经济犯罪活动打击不力，引起广大群众的强烈不满。对于这个问题，党中央、国务院都很重视，要求采取措施，加以解决。我们认为，凡构成犯罪，依法需要追究刑事责任的案件，都应当依法向人民法院起诉，由人民法院审判，任何机关无权擅自处理，不得以罚代刑。希望全国人大常委会在这方面加强监督，给予支持，有的还涉及到法律的修改问题，建议及时予以解决。
    他说，《通告》期限届满以后，各级人民法院将继续坚持对严重破坏经济的犯罪分子实行从严惩处的方针，继续坚持惩办与宽大相结合，坦白从宽、抗拒从严的政策。坦白从宽的大门始终是敞开的。对于投案自首和立功者，只要符合刑法第63条规定的条件，仍将依法从轻，减轻处罚，有的还要依法免予刑事处分。但是，从宽的幅度不会再像《通告》规定的那么大了。现在离《通告》到期只有几天的时间了，我们还要正告那些犯有贪污、受贿、投机倒把等罪行的经济犯罪分子，要抓紧时机，自首坦白，立功赎罪，争取走从宽的道路。
    任建新说，在《通告》期间投案自首的和查获的贪污、受贿、投机倒把等经济犯罪案件，今后将大量起诉到法院。及时、正确审理这些案件，是人民法院今冬和明年上半年的重要任务。人民法院审理这些案件，将继续适用《通告》的规定，依法处理。
