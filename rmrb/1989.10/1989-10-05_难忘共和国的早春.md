Ah, forty years of spring and autumn, like water flowing by...

Forty years ago, when the People's Republic was established, I was 11 years old. My hometown had just been liberated, and school had not yet started. There were no grand celebrations, but the red notices of the Central People's Government on the streets made a deep impression on me. From them, I saw the names of Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and others, which were as famous as thunder. I also saw the names of Peng Dehuai, He Long, and Xu Xiangqian. They were widely known when the Red Army passed through my hometown during the Long March. The Red Army, when passing through the town, ate the villagers' grain and vegetables, and left payment in the door cracks and courtyards, on tree trunks and fields. The villagers exclaimed that this was a righteous army, a heavenly army. From fear and avoidance, they changed to welcoming them with food and drink. Some joined this invincible iron stream, while others stayed behind and became sparks of revolution.

On the eve of liberation, due to the extensive propaganda of the Kuomintang, which said that the Communists were bandits who killed, burned, and shared wives and property, many people fled from the county seat to the countryside to avoid danger. I also followed my relatives to the countryside and only returned home after liberation. I saw that the People's Liberation Army was still the same Red Army of legend, kind and friendly, disciplined, and camping on the streets without taking a single needle or thread from the people. At that time, my family lived right across from the side door of the County Committee. County Magistrate Hao, County Committee Secretary Guo, and the County Committee Secretary known as "Da Meng" often came to our courtyard to chat with the adults like family. They all wore gray cotton uniforms. Two things particularly attracted me: one was a pen stuck in the chest pocket, and the other was a small porcelain bowl wrapped in a cloth bag on the belt. The former was used to record the opinions of the people on a notebook, and the latter was used to eat with the communication personnel in the same pot.

Soon, primary school started, and I was in the sixth grade. Propaganda team members from "North China University" taught us to sing, perform the yangge dance, and perform street theater. Songs like "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China," "The Sky in the Liberated Areas," "You Are the Lighthouse," and "Unity Is Strength" were everywhere. There was also a person who taught us Ai Siqi's "Philosophy for the Masses." All of this seemed very novel to me. At that time, every day brought new things, new words, and new ideas, shocking you, educating you, and nurturing you. You not only had an endless supply of spiritual nourishment but also received relief in material food, because just after liberation, the living conditions in the county seat were quite difficult. I had gone to the county granary several times to receive relief wheat.

I went from primary school to middle school, from being a "Red Pioneer" to becoming a member of the Communist Youth League. We were full of enthusiasm, going to the streets and countryside to do propaganda, putting up blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers; performing quick-talking books and counting rhymes; and even performing large-scale dramas such as "Blood and Tears of Hatred," "Poor People's Grievances," "White-Haired Girl," "Liu Huilan," "Wang Xiujuan," "Red Leaf River," and countless other short programs. We received revolutionary baptism in practice, and we grew up under the sunlight and dew of the Republic.

In middle school, I became a student cadre. Once, I was selected to attend the county People's Congress as a representative, which means that this little country bumpkin was also going to "participate in politics." I sat with those peasants who wrapped their heads with sheep's wool towels, with the well-dressed business people, with the open-minded scholars in long robes and gowns, with the gray-haired old principal of our middle school, with the county magistrate, county committee secretary, and other representatives from various sectors, eating and living together, discussing the county's affairs.

It was this democratic belief that allowed us to overthrow the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, establish a People's Republic like the rising sun, achieve the great achievements recognized by the world in the early days of the founding, and form a good social atmosphere where everyone helps each other. Later, I went to the provincial capital and Beijing, embarking on the long and endless journey of mountains of books and seas of learning...

Ah, the past is like smoke, but those years, those scenes, the early spring of 1949 of the Republic, I will never forget...

    难忘共和国的早春
    思效
    啊，四十个春秋，似水流年……
    四十年前，人民共和国成立时，我11岁。家乡刚刚解放，还没有开学，也没有大的庆祝活动，但街头中央人民政府的红色布告，却印象极深。从上面我看到了毛泽东、朱德、周恩来这些如雷贯耳的大名，也看到了彭德怀、贺龙、徐向前的名字，他们是红军长征经过家乡时广泛流传开来的。红军长征时从家乡擦城而过，吃了百姓的粮蔬瓜果，把酬钱放在百姓的门缝院口，树干田头。百姓惊呼这是仁义之师，天兵天将。他们从躲避、害怕到箪食壶浆，热烈欢迎。有的参加了这支无坚不摧的铁流，有的参加后又留下来成了革命的火种。
    解放前夕，由于国民党的大肆宣传，说共产党是杀人放火，共妻共产的“共匪”，许多人逃离县城到乡下去避难。我也跟着亲戚到了乡下，直到解放后才回到家里。我看到人民解放军还是传说中当年的工农红军，他们和蔼可亲，纪律严明，露宿街头，不拿群众一针一线。那时，我家就坐落在县委会侧门的对面，郝县长，县委郭书记，还有被叫作“大孟”的团县委书记，常常到我们住的院子里来，跟大人们亲如一家地拉家常。他们清一色地穿着灰色土布制服，有两样东西对我特别有吸引力：一样是上身口袋里别着一支钢笔，一样是腰间皮带上系着用布袋装起来的小瓷碗。前者是用来在本本上记录老百姓的意见的，后者则是同通讯员一起在一个锅里吃饭用的。
    不久，小学开学了，我上了六年级。“华北大学”的宣传队员教我们唱歌，扭秧歌，演活报剧。《没有共产党就没有新中国》、《解放区的天》、《你是灯塔》、《团结就是力量》等革命歌曲到处洋溢。还有一位给我们讲艾思奇的《大众哲学》。这一切对我来说，觉得分外新鲜。那时，每一天都有新事物新名词新思想，在冲击你，教育你，熏陶你。你不仅有受用不尽的精神食粮，而且在物质食粮上也得到救济，因为刚解放，县城居民的生活比较困难，我就曾经几次到县仓库里领到救济的小麦。
    我从小学上了初中，从“红领巾”转为青年团员。我们满腔热情，上街下乡搞宣传，出黑板报，墙报；说快板书，数来宝；直至演出大型戏剧，如《血泪仇》、《穷人恨》、《白毛女》、《刘胡兰》、《王秀鸾》、《赤叶河》等，还有数不清的其他短小节目。我们在实践中接受革命的洗礼，我们沐浴着共和国的阳光雨露茁壮成长。
    在中学，我当上了学生会的干部。有一次被选为出席全县人民代表会议的代表，就是说，我这个土娃娃，也要“参政”了。我跟那些用羊肚子毛巾裹着头的农民，同衣着讲究的工商界人士，同穿着长袍大褂的开明士绅，同两鬓斑白的我们中学的老校长，同县长县委书记和其他各界代表们，平起平坐，同吃同住，共商全县大事。
    正是依靠这种民主的信念，我们推翻了国民党反动派的腐败统治，建立了如旭日东升的人民共和国，赢得了建国初期那举世公认的伟大成就，形成了一个人人为我，我为人人的良好社会风气。以后奔赴省城和北京，踏上那永无止境的书山学海的漫长的路……
    啊，往事如烟，但那些岁月，那光景，共和国1949的早春我是永远忘不了的……
