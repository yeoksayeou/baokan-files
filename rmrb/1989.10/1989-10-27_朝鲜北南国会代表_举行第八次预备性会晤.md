The eighth preparatory meeting between North and South Korean parliamentarians, aimed at discussing the mutual non-aggression declaration between North and South Korea and promoting economic, material, and other forms of exchange and cooperation, resumed today after a 10-month hiatus. The meeting was held at the "Peace House" on the South Korean side of Panmunjom.

In today's talks, both sides, while maintaining their basic positions, also proposed amendments on issues such as the format, agenda, and content of the parliamentary talks.

Chief Representative of the South Korean delegation, Choi Won-shik, stated in his speech that the South would abandon its stance of discussing "economic and material exchanges between North and South" in the parliamentary talks and accept the North's proposal to discuss "multi-faceted exchanges and cooperation between North and South."

Team Leader of the North Korean delegation, Chon Kum-chol, pointed out in his speech that the North advocates for the "issuance of a mutual non-aggression declaration between North and South" in the parliamentary talks. However, the South insists that the parliament is a deliberative body and that parliamentary talks can only discuss the "mutual non-aggression declaration" issue but do not have the authority to issue it. He expressed that if the content of the "discussion on the mutual non-aggression declaration" mentioned by the South is the same as the North's, the North is willing to adopt the South's stance.

Subsequently, both sides focused on discussing the issue of releasing Mun Ik-hwan, Rim Su-gyeong, and Seo Gyeong-won, as proposed by the North Korean representatives. The South Korean representatives, however, claimed that the judicial handling of Mun Ik-hwan and Rim Su-gyeong is an internal affair of South Korea and that the North has no right to interfere.

Today's meeting lasted for 4 hours. After the meeting, Chon Kum-chol stated at a press conference that the South Korean representatives showed no sincerity in today's meeting.

Both sides agreed to hold the ninth meeting on November 29th at the "Unification Pavilion" on the North Korean side of Panmunjom.

　　朝鲜北南国会代表
　　举行第八次预备性会晤
    新华社板门店10月25日电  （记者黎能清）旨在讨论朝鲜北南方互不侵犯宣言，实现经济、物资等多方面交流与合作等问题的朝鲜北南国会会谈第八次预备性会晤，在中断了10个月后，今天在板门店南方一侧的“和平之家”举行。
    在今天的会谈中，双方在国会会谈的形式、议题、内容等问题上，除坚持过去基本立场外，又提出了修正意见。
    南方代表团首席代表蔡汶植首先在发言中表示，南方放弃在国会会谈中讨论“实现南北方经济、物资交流”的立场，接受北方提出的讨论“实现南北方多方面交流与合作”的建议。
    北方代表团团长全金哲在发言中指出，在国会会谈中，北方主张“发表南北互不侵犯宣言”，而南方坚持国会是议事机构，国会会谈只能讨论“互不侵犯宣言”问题，而无权发表。他表示如果南方所说的“讨论互不侵犯宣言”的内容与北方的相同，北方愿意采纳南方的立场。
    接着，双方代表着重讨论了北方代表提出的有关释放文益焕、林秀卿、徐敬元问题。南方代表则声称，对文益焕、林秀卿按司法处理是南朝鲜的内政问题，北方无权干涉。
    今天的会晤持续了4个小时，会晤结束后，全金哲在记者招待会上指出，南朝鲜代表在今天的会晤中没有诚意。
    双方同意第9次会晤于11月29日在板门店北方一侧“统一阁”举行。
