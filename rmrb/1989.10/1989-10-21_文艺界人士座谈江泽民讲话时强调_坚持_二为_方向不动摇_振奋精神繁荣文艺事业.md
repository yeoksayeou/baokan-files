The nature of our art and whether we should adhere to the direction of serving the people and serving socialism are fundamental issues in the prosperity and development of Chinese literature and art. At a symposium held by the Propaganda Department's Bureau of Literature and Art on October 18 to study Jiang Zemin's speech on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, attendees unanimously agreed that our art must uphold the socialist banner, and cultural workers should rally their spirits, unite as one, and strive together for the prosperity of China's art.

The symposium was chaired by Liang Guangdi and Li Zhun of the Bureau of Literature and Art. Liang Guangdi began by saying: We must fully recognize and adequately assess the importance of Jiang Zemin's speech, understand its spirit and essence, carry forward the revolutionary tradition of combining theory with practice, and uphold the fine tradition of criticism and self-criticism. We should use Jiang Zemin's speech as a weapon of thought and a guide to action, raise our ideological level, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and further promote socialist literature and art.

During the symposium, everyone pointed out that after studying Jiang Zemin's speech, they felt greatly inspired and encouraged. The speech's guidance on art work is not limited to the parts directly discussing art and spiritual civilization construction; its entire content has great guiding significance for our art work. Some comrades also sincerely criticized their own mistakes during the recent political turmoil and received warm encouragement and welcome from everyone. The entire symposium was filled with a serious, earnest, and sincere atmosphere.

Attendees believed that the speech pointed out that "the establishment, consolidation, and development of the socialist system reflect the objective laws of modern Chinese social movements and represent the greatest and deepest changes in Chinese history." This also provides the most profound and thorough theoretical basis for the existence and development of socialist art, refuting various doubts about the scientificity and rationality of socialist art. One manifestation of bourgeois liberalization in art is the denial of the socialist nature of the main part of Chinese art. We must resolutely uphold the socialist nature and direction of art. At the same time, we should calmly review and reflect: Over the years, Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized the need to oppose spiritual pollution and bourgeois liberalization, and the central authorities have made several decisions, but why have these not been effectively implemented? Is there bourgeois liberalization in art? How serious is the situation? Is the struggle against liberalization unfeasible, or has it gone too far and been exaggerated? Is it a struggle of principles or a matter of personal disputes and factional revenge? These are fundamental issues that every cultural worker should seriously consider during the study of the speech.

Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech: "Currently, the sharp confrontation between the four cardinal principles and bourgeois liberalization can be said to be largely reflected in the question of whether reform and opening up should adhere to the socialist direction." Attendees linked this to the actual situation in the art field over the years and said that the struggle on this issue in the art world is also very sharp. Those who adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance also wave the banner of reform and opening up, but in reality, they are denying the four cardinal principles and deviating from the direction of "art serving the people and serving socialism." The "reform and opening up" they advocate is a "reform and opening up" that is divorced from and opposed to the four cardinal principles. They completely deny the revolutionary art tradition since the May Fourth Movement and completely deny Chinese national culture, essentially aiming for complete Westernization or capitalist transformation. This is fundamentally different from the reform and opening up we advocate, which adheres to the four cardinal principles. This is a major issue that must be clearly distinguished.

When discussing Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech on "using Marxism and socialist ideology to guide the work of theory, propaganda, education, news, publishing, literature, and art, to occupy the ideological and public opinion fronts, and to enrich the spiritual life of the people," attendees pointed out: The struggle against bourgeois liberalization is a long-term and arduous task. It is not enough to be satisfied with verbal expressions or empty talk and formalism. We must consciously resist the infiltration of bourgeois liberalization in our thoughts and rectify the theoretical roots. The urgent task is to foster a strong atmosphere of re-learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and strive to improve our Marxist theoretical level.

Attendees pointed out: International reactionary forces have never given up their fundamental stance of hostility and subversion towards the socialist system in our country and even the world. History and reality have proven many times that the struggle between infiltration and counter-infiltration, subversion and anti-subversion, peaceful evolution and counter-peaceful evolution has always existed and will continue to exist for a long time. Our art has various functions, such as aesthetic, cognitive, and entertainment. In the struggle against peaceful evolution and resisting the infiltration and influence of bourgeois reactionary and decadent thoughts, art should also play its important role. Since our art serves the people and serves socialism, resisting peaceful evolution and defending socialism should be its inherent duty.

Wang Renshou, Minister of the Propaganda Department, attended the meeting and spoke. He said: Over the years, the influence of bourgeois liberalization in the art field has been serious. Without opposing bourgeois liberalization and clearing up the influence of liberalization and other erroneous thoughts, socialist art cannot truly prosper, nor can there be genuine "hundred flowers blooming and a hundred schools of thought contending." At the same time, we must vigorously advocate for and support excellent art works. Opposing liberalization and clearing up the influence of liberalization thoughts can only pave the way for the prosperity of art. We must also discover and support good works and, more importantly, create more new excellent works to promote the prosperity of art and meet the spiritual and cultural life needs of the people. He especially emphasized: We must fully mobilize the broad masses of cultural workers. Our team is the more, the better. Those who stubbornly adhere to the liberalization stance are a very small number. For comrades who have made general erroneous statements and works, we should stand on the side of unity and warmly help them. Most comrades have problems of understanding. After learning and reflecting, they themselves will be able to distinguish right from wrong and progress better. I hope these comrades will not carry any burdens. At the same time, we should believe that the Party will also correctly and objectively deal with these issues. Cultural workers should unite and jointly oppose bourgeois liberalization and contribute to the prosperity of socialist art.

Participants in the meeting and speakers included: Zhou Weizhi, Wu Xue, Malachov, Meng Weizhai, Zheng Bonong, Wu Taichang, Ma Liangchun, Wu Yuanmei, Fang Juifen, Tian Hua, Wang Futan, Yang Jinting, Han Ruiting, Zhang Chenghuan, Ding Zhenhai, Qiao Fushan, Cheng Daxi. Chen Yong provided a written speech. Recently, the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers' Association also held symposiums to study Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech.

### 文艺界人士座谈江泽民讲话时强调  坚持“二为”方向不动摇  振奋精神繁荣文艺事业

　　文艺界人士座谈江泽民讲话时强调
　　坚持“二为”方向不动摇
　　振奋精神繁荣文艺事业
    新华社北京10月20日电　我们的文艺到底是什么性质的文艺，要不要坚持为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向，这是繁荣、发展我国文学艺术的一个根本性问题。在10月18日中宣部文艺局召开的文艺界学习江泽民同志建国40周年讲话的座谈会上，与会同志一致认为，我们的文艺必须高扬社会主义旗帜，文艺界同仁应该振奋精神，团结一致，为我国文艺事业的繁荣共同奋斗。
    座谈会由文艺局梁光弟、李准主持。梁光弟首先说：我们必须充分认识、足够估计江泽民同志这篇讲话的重要意义，领会讲话的精神实质，发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，发扬批评与自我批评的优良传统，以江泽民讲话为思想武器和行动指针，提高我们的思想，反对资产阶级自由化，进一步繁荣社会主义文艺。
    在座谈中，大家指出，学习江泽民同志讲话后，感到非常激动，非常振奋，受到极大鼓舞。讲话对文艺工作的指导作用，绝不限于直接论述文艺和精神文明建设的部分，它的全部内容对我们文艺工作都具有巨大的指导意义。有的同志还结合学习讲话，对于自己在这场政治风波中的一些错误表现作了诚恳的自我批评，受到了大家的热情鼓励和欢迎。整个座谈会充满严肃认真、坦诚热烈的气氛。
    与会同志认为，讲话指出“社会主义制度的确立、巩固和发展，体现了中国现代社会运动的客观规律，是中国历史上最伟大、最深刻的变革”，这同时也就为社会主义文艺的存在和发展提供了最深刻、最透彻的理论依据，给种种怀疑社会主义文艺存在的科学性、合理性的思潮以有力的批驳。资产阶级自由化在文艺上的一个表现，就是否定我国文艺主导部分的社会主义性质，我们必须理直气壮地坚持社会主义文艺的性质和方向。同时，我们要冷静地回顾和反思：这些年来，小平同志一再阐明要反对精神污染，反对资产阶级自由化，中央几次作出决定，为什么一直没有得到有力的贯彻和执行？文艺上到底有没有资产阶级自由化？情况是否严重？反自由化的斗争究竟是搞不下去，还是搞过火了，搞扩大化了？究竟是原则斗争，还是人事纠纷、宗派报复？这是每个文艺工作者在学习讲话过程中，都应当认真思考的原则问题。
    江泽民同志在讲话中指出：“当前四项基本原则和资产阶级自由化的尖锐对立，可以说在很大程度上表现在改革开放要不要坚持社会主义方向这个问题上”，与会同志联系文艺领域这些年的实际情况说，在这个问题上，文艺界的斗争也是很尖锐的，坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人也打着改革开放的旗帜，实际上却是在否定四项基本原则，背离“文艺为人民服务、为社会主义服务”的方向，他们所要求的“改革开放”，是同四项基本原则相割裂相对立的“改革开放”，他们全盘否定五四以来革命文艺传统，全盘否定中国民族文化，实质上就是要全盘西化，或者说资本主义化，这和我们所主张的坚持四项基本原则的改革开放是截然不同的，这是一个必须分清的大是大非问题。
    在谈到江泽民同志讲话中关于“要用马克思主义和社会主义思想去指导理论、宣传、教育、新闻、出版、文学艺术等部门的工作，去占领思想文化阵地和舆论阵地，丰富群众的精神生活”时，与会同志指出：反对资产阶级自由化的斗争是一项长期的、艰巨的任务，绝不能满足于一次两次的口头上的表态，或讲空话，搞形式主义。要在思想上自觉地抵制资产阶级自由化思潮的侵蚀，在理论上正本清源，当务之急是树立重新学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的浓厚风气，努力提高马克思主义理论水平。
    与会同志指出：国际反动势力亡我之心不死，他们从来没有放弃敌视和颠覆我国乃至全世界社会主义制度的根本立场。历史和现实的许多事实证明，渗透与反渗透，颠覆与反颠覆、和平演变与反和平演变的斗争一直存在着，而且将长期地存在下去。我们的文艺有多种作用，如审美作用、认识作用、娱乐作用等等，在反和平演变、抵制资产阶级反动腐朽思想的侵蚀和影响的斗争中，文艺也应该发挥它的重要作用。我们的文艺既然是为人民服务、为社会主义服务的，反和平演变、捍卫社会主义就应当是它的题中应有之义。
    中宣部部长王忍之到会并讲了话，他说：这些年来，文艺领域资产阶级自由化思潮及其影响是严重的，不反对资产阶级自由化，不清理自由化及其他错误思潮的影响，社会主义文艺就不可能真正有更大的繁荣，也不可能有真正的百花齐放，百家争鸣。同时，要大力提倡、扶持优秀的文艺作品。反对自由化，清理自由化思潮的影响，只能为繁荣文艺扫清道路，还必须发掘好的作品，加以扶持和表彰，更重要的是要创作更多的新的优秀作品，来推动文艺繁荣，满足人民群众精神文化生活的需要。他特别强调说：要充分发挥广大文艺工作者的作用，我们的队伍是人越多越好。顽固坚持自由化立场的人是极少数。对有过一般错误言论和作品的同志，要立足于团结，热情地帮助。大多数同志是认识问题，经过学习和反思，他们自己会分清是非，更好地前进。希望这些同志自己也不要背包袱。同时，要相信党也会实事求是地正确地看待这些问题。文艺界的同志要团结起来，共同反对资产阶级自由化，为繁荣社会主义文艺作出贡献。
    参加会议和发言的有：周巍峙、吴雪、玛拉沁夫、孟伟哉、郑伯农、吴泰昌、马良春、吴元迈、方掬芬、田华、王夫棠、杨金亭、韩瑞亭、张澄寰、丁振海、乔福山、程代熙。陈涌同志提供了书面发言。最近，中国文联、中国作协也召开了学习江泽民同志讲话的座谈会。
