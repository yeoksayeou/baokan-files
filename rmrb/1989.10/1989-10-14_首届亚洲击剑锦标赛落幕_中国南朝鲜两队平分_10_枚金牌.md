The first Asian Fencing Championship concluded today. China and South Korea each won five gold medals, sharing the top spot with a total of ten gold medals.

	Beijing, October 13 (Xinhua) — Reporter Chen Zhao: The phrase "lose in the east, gain in the west" aptly describes China's performance in the final day of the Asian Fencing Championship. The men's sabre team gold medal, which was initially planned to be won, was unexpectedly taken by the South Korean team. However, the men's epee team title, which was not initially expected to be won, was successfully taken by the Chinese fencers from the South Korean team. The Japanese team secured third place in both events.

	In the morning final, the South Korean team narrowly defeated China 8-7 to win the women's epee team gold medal. China took silver, and Chinese Taipei secured third place.

	With this, all ten gold medals of the first Asian Fencing Championship were won by China and South Korea, with each team securing five gold medals. In the eight new events set for the 10th Asian Games, the gold medals were also split equally, indicating that the South Korean team will remain China's biggest rival in fencing at next year's Asian Games. The Chinese sabre team, which competed in the men's sabre team final this afternoon, did not perform well. Several team members had high psychological pressure, hesitated in their strikes, and often found themselves in passive situations. They also fought impatiently and eventually lost 6-9.

	However, the Chinese men's epee team was full of fighting spirit, united, and fought bravely, with overwhelming momentum, ultimately defeating their opponents 9-3.

    首届亚洲击剑锦标赛落幕
    中国南朝鲜两队平分10枚金牌
    本报北京10月13日讯　记者陈昭报道：失之东隅、收之桑榆，用这句话来比喻中国队在亚洲击剑锦标赛最后一天的比赛成绩，比较恰如其分。本来被列为计划之中的男子佩剑团体金牌，意外地被南朝鲜队夺走；而原来希望并不大的男子重剑团体桂冠，却被中国剑手们从南朝鲜队手中轻取。日本队获得这两个项目第三名。
    在今天上午举行的另外一场决赛中，南朝鲜队以8∶7险胜中国队，获得女子重剑团体金牌，中国队获亚军，中国台北队获第三名。
    至此，第一届亚洲击剑锦标赛的十枚金牌均被中国队和南朝鲜队取走，双方各得五枚。在第十届亚运会新设置的八个项目的金牌，双方也是对半分，这表明，明年亚运会中国击剑选手的最大劲敌仍是南朝鲜队。中国佩剑队在今天下午先进行的男子佩剑团体决赛中，发挥不理想。几名上场队员心理压力大，出剑不果断，常处于被动局面，并且打得急躁，最后以6∶9败北。
    而中国男子重剑队的小伙子们却斗志昂扬，团结奋战，气势如虹，最后以9∶3战胜对手。（附图片）
