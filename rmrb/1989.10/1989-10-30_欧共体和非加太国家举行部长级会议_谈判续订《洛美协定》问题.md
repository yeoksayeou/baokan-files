European Economic Community and African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries held a ministerial-level meeting today in Luxembourg to negotiate the renewal of the Lomé Convention.

The Lomé Convention was signed in 1975 and has a term of five years. It has been renewed twice since then. The current third Lomé Convention will expire in February 1990. This ministerial-level meeting is the fourth round of negotiations held since last year and is taking place amid a severe economic situation facing the ACP countries.

The ACP countries have repeatedly emphasized the complementary nature of the Lomé Convention, believing that it is beneficial not only to the ACP group but also to the EEC countries. They believe that the EEC countries should make corresponding efforts to contribute to the Lomé Convention.

It is believed that financial aid is the key to the fourth Lomé Convention. A spokesperson for the ACP group told Xinhua News Agency today that the focus of this meeting is on how much financial aid the EEC countries can provide for the Lomé Convention. He said that South-North relations are as important as East-West relations and should not be neglected.

This round of ministerial-level meeting is scheduled to last three days. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement, a fifth round of negotiations is expected to be held before the end of the year.

The fourth round of ministerial-level talks between the ACP and the EEC, which began on October 27 to renew the Lomé Convention, issued a statement today saying that the conference chair positively responded to the request by Haiti and the Dominican Republic to join the fourth Lomé Convention.

　　欧共体和非加太国家举行部长级会议
　　谈判续订《洛美协定》问题
    新华社卢森堡10月27日电　（记者杨元华）欧洲共同体和非洲、加勒比、太平洋地区国家今天下午在卢森堡举行部长级会议，就续订《洛美协定》进行谈判。
    《洛美协定》是1975年签订的，为期5年，此后曾两次续订。目前的第三个《洛美协定》将于1990年2月期满。此次部长级会议是自去年以来举行的第四轮，是在非加太国家面临严峻的经济形势下举行的。
    非加太国家多次强调《洛美协定》的互补性，认为它不仅对非加太集团，而且对共同体国家都是有利的，共同体国家应当作出相应的努力来为《洛美协定》作出贡献。
    据认为，财政援助是第四个《洛美协定》的关键。非加太集团新闻发言人今天对新华社记者说，此次会议讨论的中心是共同体国家能为《洛美协定》提供多少财政援助。他说，南北关系与东西方关系一样重要，不能厚此薄彼。
    本届部长级会议预定举行三天。如果双方不能达成协议，预计在年底前还将举行第五轮会议。
    本报卢森堡10月28日电　记者魏崴报道：10月27日开幕的旨在续签洛美协议的第四轮非加太欧共体部长级会谈于今日发布消息说，对于海地与多米尼加要求加入第四个洛美协定的申请，会议主席团予以肯定答复。
