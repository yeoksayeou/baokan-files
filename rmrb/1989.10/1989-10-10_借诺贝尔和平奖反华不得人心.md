Title: Using the Nobel Peace Prize to Anti-China is Unpopular

The Norwegian Nobel Committee recently made a decision to award the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama, who fled to a foreign country and has long been engaged in activities aimed at splitting and destroying the unity of the motherland. This absurd decision has not only aroused the great indignation of the broad masses of the Chinese people, including Tibetan compatriots, but has also been condemned by overseas Chinese and foreign people who advocate justice. They have pointed out that the decision of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs. Many opinions have pointed out that Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory. The Tibet issue is purely an internal affair of China. The decision of the Norwegian Nobel Committee is to turn the "Peace Prize" into a tool for some people in Western countries to achieve some unspoken purposes.

The Chinese-language newspaper "Shang Bao" published in Manila, Philippines, in an article titled "The Peace Prize Can Rest," pointed out that the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama after the death of the Panchen Lama and the June 4th incident in Tiananmen Square, which is "a blatant violation of China's unity and interference in China's internal affairs," and "again exposed the Nobel Prize as a political tool of the Western world, further degrading the status of the Nobel Prize in the eyes of the world." The commentary expressed surprise that the Norwegian Nobel Committee had "sunk to the level of supporting the restoration of religious feudal serfdom."

Newspapers in Hong Kong and Macao pointed out that the decision of the Nobel Committee shows that the Nobel Peace Prize is not about promoting peace but about inciting opposition, and it is out of political necessity. An editorial in the "Macao Daily" said that since the failure of the Tibetan reactionary rebellion in 1959, the Dalai Lama has "never stopped his activities to split the motherland, seeking so-called 'Tibet independence,' under the banner of protecting Tibet's 'human rights,' distorting the situation in Tibet, and actively promoting Western countries to interfere in Tibet's affairs," attempting to "internationalize" the Tibet issue. The article revealed that the Dalai Lama, who always advocates "non-violent struggle," is clearly related to the planning and incitement of the Dalai Lama and other overseas separatist forces. Among the people who instigated the Lhasa riots last year, there were so-called special agents of the Dalai Lama's "exile government."

Tibet has been a sacred territory of China since ancient times and is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. No foreign government has recognized Tibet as an independent country. However, in the announcement of awarding the Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama, the Norwegian Nobel Committee actually said that "China occupied Tibet," calling the Dalai Lama the "head of state of Tibet," who has been "fighting for liberation." Such blatant incitement to split China was condemned by the General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Marchais, as "a despicable trick" and "a politician's trick." Some Japanese newspapers also believe that the background of awarding the Dalai Lama the Nobel Peace Prize is related to international politics, and behind it, "there is obviously the plot of the West." What is the plot of the West? In short, it is to encourage and support the Dalai Lama and his group to disrupt national unity and split the motherland. A vice-chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee did not deny that their purpose in doing so was to make Tibet "separate from the rule of the Chinese people" and support the Dalai Lama's "struggle for the liberation of Tibet." As the "Chinese Daily" in Thailand said, the Nobel Committee's decision to award the Dalai Lama the Peace Prize naturally "cannot escape the criticism of interfering in China's internal affairs and attempting to split China's territory."

The Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to those who have made efforts and contributions to "friendship and harmony between nations," but this time it went against the principle and awarded the prize to the Dalai Lama, who incites ethnic conflicts and splits the motherland, which is indeed a great mockery of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Some people in the West think that by awarding such a person a "Peace Prize," they can tarnish China's image and separate Tibet from China, which is purely wishful thinking.

    借诺贝尔和平奖反华不得人心
    冬明
    挪威诺贝尔委员会日前竟然作出决定，宣布把1989年度的诺贝尔和平奖授予跑到国外、长期从事旨在分裂和破坏祖国统一活动的达赖。这一荒唐的决定，不仅激起包括藏族同胞在内的广大中国人民的极大愤慨，而且也遭到旅居海外的侨胞以及主张正义的外国人士的同声谴责。他们明确指出，诺贝尔和平奖委员会的这项决定，是对中国内政的明目张胆的干涉。许多舆论指出，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分。西藏问题纯属中国内政。挪威诺贝尔委员会的决定是把“和平奖”变成了西方国家中某些人用来达到某种不可告人目的的工具。
    在菲律宾马尼拉出版的中文报纸《商报》在一篇题为《和平奖可以休矣》的述评中指出，挪威诺贝尔委员会在班禅大师逝世和天安门“六四事件”后授和平奖给达赖，是“司马昭之心，路人皆知”，是“粗暴地破坏中国的统一与干涉中国内政”，“再次暴露诺贝尔奖金实是西方世界的政治工具，并更加贬低了诺贝尔奖金在世人眼中的地位”。述评对挪威诺贝尔委员会竟然“沉沦到为宗教封建农奴统治复辟打气”感到吃惊。
    香港、澳门的报纸指出，诺贝尔委员会的这一决定，说明诺贝尔和平奖不是促进和平而是煽起对立情绪，是出于政治的需要。《澳门日报》的一篇评论说，达赖自1959年西藏反动分子叛乱失败逃到国外后，“一直没有停止过分裂祖国的活动，谋求所谓‘西藏独立’，打着所谓维护西藏‘人权’的招牌，歪曲西藏的现状，在欧美四处活动，引外国势力干涉西藏事务”，企图使西藏问题“国际化”。该文揭露说，达赖口口声声主张“非暴力斗争”，但西藏近年发生的多次暴力事件，却明显与达赖这些海外分裂势力的煽动和策划有关。去年挑起拉萨暴乱的人中间，就有所谓达赖“流亡政府”的特工。
    西藏自古就是中国神圣领土，是中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分，任何一个外国政府都没有承认西藏是一个独立国家。而挪威诺贝尔委员会在宣布把和平奖授予达赖的公报中，竟然胡说是“中国占领了西藏”，称达赖是什么“西藏的国家元首”，为“解放展开了不懈斗争”，云云。对这种公然煽动分裂中国的胡言乱语，法共总书记马歇斥之为“卑鄙的小人”和“政客的小伎俩”。日本一些报纸也认为，授予达赖诺贝尔和平奖的背后带有国际政治上的考虑，其背后显然“隐藏着西方的图谋”。西方的图谋是什么？说穿了，就是纵容和支持达赖一伙破坏民族团结、分裂祖国的勾当。挪威诺贝尔委员会的一位副主席也不否认他们这样做的目的是使西藏“脱离中国人的统治”，支持达赖“解放西藏的斗争”。正如泰国《中华日报》所说，诺贝尔委员会宣布授予达赖和平奖之举，理所当然地“难逃干涉中国内政、企图分裂中国领土的谴责”。
    诺贝尔和平奖本应奖给那些为“民族间的和睦亲善”作出努力和贡献的人，而这次却反其道而行之，把挑动民族矛盾、分裂祖国的达赖作为授奖对象，实在是对诺贝尔和平奖的莫大嘲弄。
    西方某些人以为，给这样一个人物授个什么“和平奖”，就可以丑化中国的形象，就可以把西藏从中国分裂出去，这纯粹是痴心妄想。
