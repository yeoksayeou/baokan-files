Devastating earthquakes are extremely terrifying natural disasters. Their sudden onset and massive destruction can cause large-scale disasters in a very short time. Although the Tangshan earthquake occurred 13 years ago, the scars it left behind are still fresh in our memory. Passing by No. 63, Fuxing Road, Beijing, and stepping into the gate of the China Earthquake Administration, a thought crossed my mind: "Can China predict earthquakes?"

The researchers in this building did not immediately answer my question. Instead, they spread out a large map of China on the floor, marked with countless red pins. This represents their basic research on the major seismic activity belts across the country over the past 20 years. From the map, one can see which regions have the conditions for earthquakes. Through this survey, earthquake workers have significantly advanced their understanding of the patterns of earthquakes in China. This map was drawn based on thousands of years of accumulated data and extensive geological surveys, something that previous generations had not done. It is undoubtedly a precious legacy left for our descendants. Only in China are there records of earthquake short-term forecasts that date back to ancient times; the earthquake phenomena described in Chinese texts can be traced back over 4,000 years. However, earthquake science is quite young, having only developed in this century. In October 1949, when the People's Republic of China was established, the entire legacy of earthquake science left by the old China was just two broken machines and three people. This was the starting point of earthquake science in New China.

The official in charge of science and technology at the China Earthquake Administration proudly said, "Earthquake prediction is a new field internationally, starting in the mid-1960s. China's earthquake prediction has joined the world's top four (the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, and China). This is internationally recognized."

"How do you know this?" I asked.

He continued, "In the process of repeated exploration, our country has gradually gained an initial understanding of the earthquake gestation process and corresponding precursor phenomena, forming some empirical prediction methods. The successful prediction of the 1975 Haicheng earthquake was the world's first effective prediction, which avoided the deaths of 100,000 people and economic losses of 4 billion yuan. Later, our country also made relatively good predictions for several major earthquakes, such as the Songpan earthquake."

At this point, everyone became excited. They also told the reporter, "Only our socialist country in China issues short-term and imminent earthquake forecasts. The Haicheng earthquake is of this type. The Party and the government, out of a high sense of responsibility for the safety of people's lives and property, issued a short-term forecast in a decisive manner, stopping factories and evacuating the public. Capitalist countries' governments do not issue short-term earthquake forecasts. Japan is a country with frequent earthquakes, but its short-term forecasts are limited to the Tokyo magnitude 8 earthquake, and nothing else is reported. Earthquakes test the government, and in modern society, whether a government is competent is not only seen in its role after a disaster but more importantly in its actions before the disaster. Our government should be considered competent."

The seismic monitoring network covers the entire country

Since earthquake prediction is a new science, people's understanding of it is still insufficient, and opportunities for earthquake practice are rare. The Haicheng earthquake was successfully predicted, but the 1976 Tangshan earthquake was not predicted in time. It was precisely because of this that after the Tangshan earthquake, the Party and the government paid even more attention to the study of earthquake science, and the great development of earthquake science is a matter of the past decade or so. So far, 460 seismic monitoring stations have been established in important seismic areas across the country, covering various observation projects such as seismology, geomorphology, hydrology, hydrochemistry, geomagnetism, and geoelectricity; at the same time, more than 20,000 kilometers of geomorphological mobile observations are conducted each year, with more than 4,000 observation points. The country has also established 163 local earthquake stations and 131 enterprise-operated earthquake stations. In 446 prefectures, cities, and counties, local earthquake prevention agencies have been set up. China has formed a relatively large-scale, unique in the world, monitoring and prediction network that combines professionals and the public.

With the progress of science and technology, seismic observation technology is also continuously improving. After the Tangshan earthquake, six major seismic telecommunication transmission networks were successively built in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Chengdu, Kunming, and Lanzhou. At the same time, 12 regional wireless remote sensing networks were established in some seismic-prone areas across the country, basically covering densely populated seismic areas and belts. Nine digital seismic stations with world-advanced levels have also begun operation.

The experts here reminded the reporter to pay attention to the fact that the evaluation of the level of earthquake science is not only based on the ability to predict earthquakes but also on its seismic resistance and prevention capabilities. Even if some degree of prediction is made before an earthquake, people's casualties will be greatly reduced, but buildings and other facilities will still be damaged or even collapse. Therefore, the seismic resistance and prevention of major projects and buildings are particularly important.

In the late 1950s, after the completion of the Xinfengjiang Reservoir in China, a series of small earthquakes occurred. Chinese earthquake scientists conducted comprehensive research on the characteristics, causes, mechanisms, development trends of reservoir-induced earthquakes, and the seismic resistance of the dam. Based on the research results, relevant departments timely reinforced the dam. On March 19, 1962, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake occurred 1 kilometer away from the dam. Due to the timely reinforcement, although the dam developed cracks, it remained standing, ensuring the safety of the downstream area, especially Guangzhou City. This was the world's first effective engineering seismic reinforcement.

The completion of some engineering earthquake projects also indicates that China's engineering earthquake technology has reached an international level. In recent years, the seismic hazard analysis and earthquake motion parameter research results provided by China for three offshore platforms in the Bohai Oilfield have surpassed those of the Japanese consulting company responsible for the other two offshore platforms in the same oilfield. Due to China's engineering earthquake level having a certain influence internationally, China is currently also undertaking seismic zoning and engineering site intensity identification tasks for some foreign regions.

Only China has a government agency specifically responsible for earthquakes

Today, humans are far from being able to stop earthquakes from occurring, but humans can take appropriate measures to mitigate earthquake disasters as much as possible. The officials at the China Earthquake Administration are full of confidence in this regard. They pointed to the "China Earthquake Administration" sign and said, "The world has only China that has a dedicated China Earthquake Administration under the State Council. Other countries' earthquake-related units are attached to some departments and are scattered. This also shows that our country attaches great importance to earthquake work." When I finished the interview and left the building, it was already dusk. People were rushing home from work. I looked at the "China Earthquake Administration" sign again, and suddenly a sense of happiness welled up in my heart: Every family gathering for dinner, have you ever thought of the earthquake monitoring personnel scattered in the wilderness, closely observing the movements of the earth, and timely transmitting information to this building, all for the sake of reporting to you before the earth shakes?

Yes! We live in a stable environment, and we must not forget the tens of thousands of people who are fighting against the "earthquake demon."

    与地震作斗争的人们
    ——访国家地震局
    本报记者  蒋涵箴
    毁灭性的大地震是极其可怕的天灾，它来势之猛、破坏之大可在极短时间内造成大规模的灾难。唐山大地震尽管已是13年前的事了，可留下的伤痕仍然记忆犹新。路过北京复兴路63号，迈进国家地震局的大门，一个念头在我脑际掠过：“中国到底能否预报地震？”
    这幢大楼里的科研人员并没有马上回答我的提问。先是在地上铺开了一张极大的中国地图，上面标着无数的红剪头，这就是他们近20年来对全国主要地震活动带所作的基础研究，从图上可以看出，哪些地区有发生地震的条件。通过这次调查，地震工作者对中国地震发生的规律性认识大大地前进了一步。这张地图是根据几千年来积累的资料及大量的地质调查后绘制出来的，这是一件前人没有做过的事情，留给我们的子孙后代无疑是一份宝贵的财富。唯有中国发布地震短期预报有关地震的记载十分久远，我国文字记录中所描述的地震现象可追溯到4000多年前；地震科学却十分年轻，本世纪才得以发展起来。1949年10月，中华人民共和国成立时，旧中国给地震科学留下的全部家当就是两台破残机器、三个人，这就是新中国地震科学的起步。
    国家地震局主管科技的同志自豪地说：“地震预报是国际上的新学科，是从60年代中期开始的。中国的地震预报已跻身世界四强（即美国、日本、苏联、中国）。这是国际上公认的。”
    “何以见得呢？”我问。
    他接着说：“我国的地震预报在反复的探索过程中，对地震孕育的过程及相应的前兆表现逐渐取得了初步认识，形成了一些经验性的预报方法。1975年海城地震的成功预报是世界上第一次有实效的预报，它避免了10万人的死亡和40亿元的经济损失。后来我国又对松潘地震等几次大震作了较好的预报。”
    说到这里，大家都很兴奋。他们还告诉记者：“世界上只有我们中国这样的社会主义国家发布地震短期、临震预报，海城地震就属于这样的预报。党和政府出于对人民生命财产安危的高度责任性，果断地发出了短期预报，让工厂停工、让老百姓尽快转移。资本主义国家的政府从不发布地震短期预报。日本是一个多地震国家，它的短期预报只限于东京八级地震，其它的一概不报。地震给政府带来了考验，现代社会看一个政府是否称职，不仅要看其在灾害发生以后的作用，更重要是要看在灾害发生之前的作为。我们的政府应该说是称职的。”
    地震测报台网覆盖全国
    由于地震预报是一门新兴的科学，人们对它的认识还不够，地震的实践机会又很少，海城地震预报成功了，但是1976年的唐山大地震却没有及时预报。也正是由于此，唐山大震之后，党和政府对地震科学的研究更加重视了，地震科学的大发展也是近十几年来的事。到目前为止，全国已在重要地震区建立了测震、地形变、水动态、水化学、地磁、地电等多种观测项目的460个地震监测站；同时，每年还开展2万多公里的地形变的流动观测，观测点4000多个。全国还建立了163个地方办的地震台和131个企业办的地震台。在446个地、市、县设有地方防震工作机构。我国已形成了一个相当规模的、专群结合的、在世界上独具特色的监测预报网。
    随着科学技术的进步，地震观测技术也不断得到改善。唐山地震后，在北京、沈阳、上海、成都、昆明、兰州相继建成6大电信传输地震台网。同时还在全国一些多震区建立了12个区域无线遥测台网，基本覆盖了人口密集的地震区、带。具有世界先进水平的9个数字化地震台站也已开始运行。
    这里的专家提醒记者注意，评价地震科学水平的高低，不仅仅看预报地震的能力，还要看它的抗震设防能力。地震发生后，即使事先作出某种程度的预报，使人员伤亡大为减轻，但建筑物及其它设施仍要受损失乃至坍塌，因此重大工程、建筑物的抗震防震尤为重要。
    50年代末，我国新丰江水库建成后，发生了一系列小地震。我国的地震科学工作者对水库地震活动的特点、成因机制、发展趋势及大坝的抗震问题进行了综合研究，有关部门根据研究结果，及时对大坝进行了加固。1962年3月19日在离大坝1公里处发生了6.1级地震，由于及时进行了加固，大坝虽出现裂缝，但仍安然屹立，保证了下游特别是广州市的安全。这是世界上第一次取得实效的工程抗震加固。
    一些项目的工程地震工作的完成，还表明我国工程地震技术已具有国际水平。近几年来我国为渤海油田的三个海洋平台场址提供的地震危险性分析及地震动参数的研究成果，与日本工程顾问公司承担的该油田其它两个海洋平台场址的研究成果相比，我们的水平高于日方。由于中国工程地震水平在国际上有一定的影响，目前我国还承担了国外一些地区的地震区划和工程场地烈度鉴定任务。
    只有中国专设主管地震的政府机构
    在今天，人类远不能阻止地震的发生，但人类可以采取适当的对策尽量减轻地震灾害，地震局的同志对此充满了信心。他们指着“国家地震局”这块牌子说：“世界上只有中国在国务院下面专门设立国家地震局这一机构，别的国家主管地震的单位都是附设在一些部门里，而且是分散的。这也表明我们国家对地震工作的重视。”当我采访结束离开这幢大楼时已近黄昏，下班的人们纷纷赶回家。我再一次注视“国家地震局”这块大牌子，顿时一种幸福感涌上心头：每一个家庭聚集在一起用晚餐时，你可曾想到遍布在荒山野外的地震监测人员，正在密切观察大地的动向，随时向这幢大楼传递信息，为的是在大地抖动之前及时向您作出报告。
    是啊！我们生活在安定的环境里，千万不要忘记成千上万与“震魔”作斗争的人。
