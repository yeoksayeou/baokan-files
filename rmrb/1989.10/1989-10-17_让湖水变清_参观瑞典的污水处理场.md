Stockholm is located on the shores of Lake Mälaren, with the Baltic Sea to the east. The city is crisscrossed with waterways, earning it the nickname "Northern Venice." However, if you mention this nickname today, Swedes might just smile and brush it off. An American friend who recently visited Venice said that the water there can't compare to Stockholm's, and you can smell the sewage before even entering the city. Nevertheless, the Swedes have made tremendous efforts to clean up the pollution in Lake Mälaren.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Lake Mälaren, like many other lakes in Sweden, suffered severe pollution. Large amounts of industrial wastewater were dumped into the lake, leading to oxygen depletion, increased toxic substances, massive fish deaths, and people avoiding swimming. It took over a decade for the Stockholm region to build a sewage treatment system, finally freeing Lake Mälaren from the threat of pollution.

The city now has four sewage treatment plants. We visited the Kävesta treatment plant, located near the main inlet of Lake Mälaren to the sea. From the surface, except for a few tall chimneys, it looks no different from its surroundings. Most of the plant's facilities are located 20 meters underground. It is said that treating sewage underground is better as it does not affect the surface environment and saves costs.

Sewage from nine administrative districts in northern Stockholm is collected here through underground tunnels totaling over 60 kilometers in length, amounting to more than 5,000 cubic meters annually, with industrial wastewater accounting for 25%. We toured the entire treatment plant and saw the three processes of mechanical, chemical, and biological treatment of sewage.

The sewage first passes through three metal bar screens, removing paper, fruit peels, and other trash. It then enters a chemical treatment tank, where it is stirred in a solution containing ferrous sulfate and air. As a result, lighter sludge floats, and heavier materials like sand sink, which are then separated by a suction device. The water then flows into six sedimentation tanks, each 50 meters long and 12 meters wide, where the sludge is scraped out. It then enters six aeration tanks, each 101 meters long and 12 meters wide, for biological treatment. The plant uses the activated sludge method to decompose and remove impurities from the water, and then adds sulfuric acid phosphate to reduce the phosphorus content. After these processes, the originally foul-smelling sewage becomes clear water. It is said that the water purity meets national standards, with phosphorus content reduced by over 90%, reaching 0.01 parts per million. The treated clear water is discharged into the Baltic Sea through underground pipes.

The plant collects the sludge and trash removed from the sewage in a sedimentation tank, where it ferments for 20 days and is then sold to farms as fertilizer. The biogas produced is used for heating the plant and is also supplied to nearby residents. There are 60 workers here, and all the treatment work is controlled by computers.

Accompanying personnel explained that the current cost of treating one cubic meter of water is about 60 öre (approximately 3 fen in RMB). These costs are partly borne by the nine administrative districts and enterprises based on their discharge volume, and partly added to the residents' water bills. Sewage treatment helps improve the living environment, and residents are willing to pay this fee.

Leaving the sewage treatment plant, we saw a nearby beach not far away. People were swimming and sunbathing. The treatment plant discharges clean water, so they have nothing to worry about.

    让湖水变清
    ——参观瑞典的污水处理场
    本报记者  顾耀铭
    斯德哥尔摩位于梅拉伦湖畔，东靠波罗的海，全市水道纵横，有
  “北方威尼斯”之称。然而，今天你再提这个称号，瑞典人可能会不以为然地笑笑。据一位刚去过威尼斯的美国朋友说，威尼斯的水不能与这里的相比，还没有进威尼斯市就闻到了污水的臭味。不过，瑞典人为治理梅拉伦湖的污染，是付出过巨大努力的。
    五六十年代，梅拉伦湖和瑞典其它一些湖泊一样，遭受了严重污染。大量工业废水往湖里灌，造成湖水缺氧，有毒成份剧增，鱼类大批死亡，人们不敢再去游泳。斯德哥尔摩地区用了10多年时间兴建污水处理系统，才使梅拉伦湖不再受污水的危害。
    这座城市现有4个污水处理场，我们参观了位于梅拉伦湖主要入海口附近的凯帕拉污水处理场。从表面看，除了几个高大的烟囱，它同四周没有什么两样。处理场的大部分设施在20米深的地下。据介绍，在地下处理污水比较好，不至影响地面环境又可节省开支。
    斯德哥尔摩北部9个行政区的污水，通过总长达60多公里的地下坑道集中到这里，每年多达5000多立方米，其中工业废水占25％。我们参观了整个处理场，看到用机械、化学和生物手段处理污水的3个过程。
    污水先通过3道棒状金属筛网，纸张、果皮等垃圾被去除，然后，进入化学处理罐，在含有硫酸亚铁和空气的溶液中搅动，结果，比重小的淤渣悬浮，沙子等重物下沉，由吸引装置将其分离出。河水接着进入6个长50米、宽12米的沉积池，刮削器将淤渣排除，然后进入6个长101米、宽12米的曝气池接受生物处理。处理场采用活性污泥法，分解排除水中的杂质，再加入硫酸磷使含磷量减少。经过这样几道工序，原来散发出腥臭的污水变成了明净的清水。据介绍，水的纯洁度均达国家要求的标准，其中磷的含量减少了90％以上，达百万分之零点零一。处理后的清水通过地下管道放入波罗的海。
    处理场将从污水中清除的污泥、垃圾等，集中在沉降槽里发酵20天，脱水后，卖给农场作肥料。所产生的沼气，除供本场加热用外，还向附近居民提供。这里的工作人员总共60名，全部处理工作都由计算机控制。
    陪同人员介绍，目前每处理1立方米水的开支约合60欧尔（约为人民币3角），这些费用一部分由9个行政区和企业按排水量分摊，一部分附加在居民的水费里。污水处理有助于改善生活环境，居民乐于支付这笔费用。
    从污水处理场出来，我们看到离此不远有一个海滩浴场。人们在游泳、晒太阳。污水处理场放出的是清水，他们没有什么可担忧的。
