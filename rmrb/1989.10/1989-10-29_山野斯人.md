The situation should have been the opposite. At the very least, he shouldn't have been the one running over from the ridge, his two arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome and gratitude—he was a national model worker!

It was he who sent batch after batch of Miao and Buyi students to middle school and university!

It was he who spread the seeds of culture and civilization across every high mountain and distant hill, every wooden house and bamboo hut!

Years of dedication had already become a poem that moved heaven and earth! I should have rushed forward to express my admiration, respect, gratitude, and thanks. But he had already run over, his feet covered in mud, a group of disciples following closely behind, crossing the ridge squeezed by the yellow rapeseed flowers…

Three hours later, the stream at the foot of the mountain had narrowed to a thin thread, more like a silver ribbon casually tied around a girl's neck and blown open by the wind. Zhang Chengbang's wooden house was still hidden on the mountain peak, its whereabouts unknown.

“How high is this Top Ear Mountain? Did the teacher name it?”

The guide said, “Who knows. There are several square kilometers of green grasslands on the mountain top. It looks like a flat-topped head. The Top Ear Village is right under the ‘head,’ in the position of the ear. So it is!”

“The path is not easy to walk. When the teacher comes down the mountain, and the children go up, they need good stamina.”

“That's right. In the 1960s, tigers and wolves roamed. The teacher had just set up the school, and if there were any problems, he would go down the mountain to seek advice, never without a stick in his hand to scare off snakes and use as a cane.”

A crisp, bright mountain song pierced through the grass, suddenly reaching for the white clouds.

“It must be a Miao girl from another village coming up the mountain to study,” the guide, who spoke little but accurately, told me.

Indeed, the song grew closer and more beautiful, making one feel comfortable all over.

Back in the provincial capital, I had seen his file. Ever since Zhang Laoshi set up the Top Ear Mountain school, which became famous far and wide, the primary school in the village below could not compare to it (students from the primary school could not get into the highest school in the county—County No. 1 Middle School, but Zhang Laoshi's bamboo shed school had students who made it onto the honor roll). Far and near, from different villages, people began to send their children to Top Ear Mountain. There were Miao and Buyi; there were those from this district and those from outside; some had to walk ten or twenty li of mountain roads, and some had to walk forty or fifty li, even a hundred or eighty li. These children not only studied on Top Ear Mountain but also ate and lived there.

Three Miao girls, dressed in flowered cloth and with white cloths on their heads, like small clouds, were already swaying towards us. Each of them carried things on their shoulders. A short, straight wooden pole carried two large baskets, one in front and one behind. They had not noticed someone hiding behind the rocks, waiting for them, so the song did not stop. As soon as they turned a corner and saw strangers, they instinctively stopped singing.

I stood up to praise their singing and asked about the rice and vegetables in their baskets, whether they were for their own boarding or if their parents, unable to gather enough money, had sent them to the teacher as “salary”?

The three young girls smiled and nodded, but they couldn't say whether they agreed with my first guess or the second, or if both purposes were present. In the forty years since the founding of New China, the number of private school teachers scattered across the mountains and rivers of the south, north, west, and east had grown to 3 million. These people shouldered more than 50% of the task of universal primary education in the country, and they could only take 19 yuan from the national treasury each month. In some areas with better economic conditions, students' parents could contribute some money to help the teacher and his family, but in poorer areas, if Zhang's family could contribute a basket of rice, and Li's family could contribute a basket of vegetables or salt, that would be fine.

The Top Ear Mountain school could no longer hide.

Just like modern art deliberately returns to simplicity, seeking the original form of things. The school walls were made of rammed earth, and the pillars were made of raw wood. Every building material was not adorned with a single decoration, allowing its natural shape, color, and texture to be fully displayed. The blackboard, made of local wood, was not a strict rectangle, but compared to the wooden desks and chairs stuck in the yellow soil of the classroom, it was standardized.

Outside the classroom, by the rice fields, there was a piece of land cleared by human hands, still with fresh soil turned over. This was the basketball court that Zhang Laoshi had opened for the children. At one end of the court, a small basketball hoop was erected, imitating the tiger.

I asked where the boarding students lived. Zhang Laoshi kept pointing this way and that, then symbolically took me to visit a dilapidated small wooden house that was completely unimaginable for human habitation. This was a dormitory with unparalleled humidity and darkness. Some students slept on a one-foot-high kang, some slept on the ground due to lack of space, some used cotton as a mattress, and some used grass. In the middle of the room, there was a fire pit the size of a basin used for warming and cooking in winter. The traces of smoke were everywhere, scorching the walls of the room.

To be honest, I work in the national education center department. Such school conditions, I can't say I've never heard of them, but I've never seen them.

My heart sank. Zhang Laoshi saw my expression and quickly encouraged me, “The conditions are a bit tough, but compared to the past, we can at least teach steadily now, with dormitories, classrooms, and a playground…”

I knew that in Zhang Laoshi's heart, there was a “past” that weighed much heavier than any hardship and suffering. That was a pocket containing years of sacrifice and dedication, as well as bitterness and humiliation.

“Life is hard, but we are not afraid. The people of the mountains have endured half a year of plenty and half a year of hunger for generations, and they are used to it. But we teach not only to spread culture to the high mountains, to change the backwardness of the hometown, to save people from suffering? Why is this road so difficult to walk…”

At night, sitting in Zhang Laoshi's wooden house, I opened my notebook. A small oil lamp made from an ink bottle emitted a faint light. Several wooden boards that were used as windows during the day to let in light were closed, and the darkness of the wooden house devoured the flickering flame. The black mountain pressed down on the wooden house.

Zhang Chengbang's ancestral home was in Jiangxi. He was Han Chinese. Seven or eight generations ago, his ancestors had been the magistrate of Qinghe County. Due to the loss of the county treasury, they were demoted and exiled to Guizhou. After that, the Zhang family suffered humiliation at the hands of a powerful local family for generations. His great-grandfather wanted to write a petition to the authorities, only to discover that the family's scholarly traditions had long been extinguished. In despair, he left a will:

“Hire a private tutor. In the future, if the Zhang family's scholarly traditions are not interrupted, the private tutor must be supported by the family!”

Zhang Chengbang grew up in such a “microclimate,” under the whip of the private tutor, although Top Ear Mountain was remote and far from human habitation, the blood of traditional Chinese culture flowed in his veins.

In 1963, Zhang Chengbang graduated from the county middle school. The teacher wanted to keep him as a school worker, changing his urban household registration, so he would never have to return to the high mountains to suffer. But Zhang Chengbang did not agree. He wanted to take the teacher's exam to continue his studies, to learn knowledge, to learn how to teach, and then “return in glory” to Top Ear Mountain to set up a “modern school.” The dream came true, and he was admitted to the normal school. On the day he received the admission notice, Chengbang was so happy that he rolled and laughed on the hills, and the mountains echoed his joyous cries. The next day, Zhang Chengbang took a few glutinous rice cakes and two packs of the best local “Chaoyang Bridge” brand cigarettes to the commune to get his school introduction letter. He was like a chick that knew it would grow iron wings and soar through the sky, his heart filled with vigorous pride and joy. However, he did not expect that when he arrived at the commune and found the education secretary, the letter was not issued—“The son of a rich peasant wants to go to normal school?! It's already a favor that you were allowed to finish middle school! Go, go back home and work hard!”

It was deep night. The night in the mountains was truly dark and stifling. Wolves howled helplessly at the starry sky in the mountains. Zhang Chengbang's family, uncles, brothers, and cousins were all gathered around the fire pit in the middle of the room, waiting for little Chengbang to pave the way to “Chaoyang” so they could bring the introduction letter back home. Who would have thought that Chengbang, who had not eaten a grain of rice for a day and a night, burst into the house, crazed and weeping, covering his head with a quilt and lying down for several days, like a dead man…

Top Ear Mountain was naturally isolated from the world. There was no electricity or mail service. If someone wanted to send a word or a grain of rice to the mountain, they would have to pay 25 yuan to hire a porter. The sound of humanity's great strides towards prosperity and strength did not reach here, and modern production and living information did not reach here, but no movement forgot this small village hidden in the ear of a big mountain. The Great Leap Forward, the Four Cleanups, the Cultural Revolution…

Zhang Chengbang slept for several days, waking up, his mind still could not let go. Not allowing me to go to normal school, I will also set up a school! If I can't set up a “modern school,” I'll set up a “traditional” one. After the Cultural Revolution, the private tutors were all driven down the mountain, and the children of dozens of households in the village spent the whole day herding sheep on the hills and in the gullies. The children could not afford to waste time. As a rich peasant, Chengbang's father left a few wooden houses (all his property) when he died. The fifth son, Chengbang, sold his share of the house, exchanging it for 100 yuan, which was originally intended to pay for his normal school fees for a few years, now all used as school funds.

On the fourth day of the first month of 1964, a fiery sun climbed up the wooden window frame of Zhang Chengbang's uncle's house (after selling the house, he lived in his uncle's house). The first school in Top Ear Mountain since the beginning of the world was born with a burst of wild firecrackers. 12 students, the oldest 14 years old (only two years younger than Chengbang); the youngest only 4 years old. Later, half of the class was taught, and this youngest child still had to raise his hand to report to the teacher to let him go home to drink milk—breastfeed.

No matter what, the school was set up, and that was the beginning of the cause. In Zhang Chengbang's eyes, this cause was no less glorious and sacred than the rising sun. The sun rises every day, and the school must also ring out with the sound of reading every day. He used the 100 yuan from selling the house to buy language and arithmetic books for his first batch of “12 disciples.” The classroom was set up in his uncle's house, and the students' desks were their own knees, bringing their own stools. Chengbang's small blackboard, given to him by his father when he was in primary school, was now in use, hanging on the wooden wall every day with the sound of the bell.

For 25 years, without the “imperial decree,” without anyone giving him a penny of school construction funds or school running funds, at the beginning, not even a penny of salary or living expenses was given to him. He built this primary school and held onto this primary school. The Four Cleanups came, and the work team said the same thing, “How can a rich peasant teach poor peasants?!” The school was disbanded; the Cultural Revolution came, and he was labeled with the hat of “poisoning the minds of the children of poor and lower-middle peasants.” The school was replaced by more than ten teachers who were “trusted,” but they all packed up and left the mountain, unable to endure the hardships of the high mountains. Only Zhang Chengbang, like a floating ball in the water, would pop up as long as he was not suppressed, and he would teach and run the school, sending students out of the deep mountains. In 25 years, he had brought out batch after batch of outstanding students with both moral and academic excellence. Some of them went to vocational schools, some to junior colleges, some to undergraduate programs, and some inherited his mantle and returned to Top Ear Mountain to become the second generation of cultural sowers in the high mountains…

It was truly a case of fate.

That year, when I left Top Ear Mountain, the host sent me a long way. A bamboo stick prepared especially for me was handed over: “This farewell is difficult. The mountain road is steep, you must use it to support yourself.” Who would have thought that a year later, at the National Excellent Teachers Summer Camp in Yantai, we could meet again. Surprise and excitement were not without the mystery of fate.

Perhaps only I knew that if Zhang Laoshi had not become a national model worker in the education system, he would not even know what his Zunyi Prefecture, the capital of the Guizhou Miao and Buyi Autonomous Prefecture, looked like, let alone go to the provincial capital or cross the provincial border. Today, he has crossed half of China, seen the plains and the sea; eaten mountain delicacies and seafood; used the most modern living facilities—

A teacher born and bred in the high mountains, can his simple heart hold so many “stimuli”?

I listened intently, my eyes followed, and I became excited, proud, and also vaguely worried.

Would the sky really not fall?

Or would it be pierced by some sharp instrument?

He was still the same, wrapped in the marks of mountain life, and added a layer of color to those marks due to the success of his career, which was unashamed of the high mountains. His sturdy limbs, his not-so-tall but sturdy figure, his dark face, his neck burned black by the sun, his protruding forehead, his eyes that had seen the great mountains since childhood and thus knew no retreat, shining like a beam of light, and his wisdom that had not been swallowed by the distant mountains and wilds, and the hereditary genes of the scholar that would never be extinguished.

The National Education Commission Academic Activity Center is located in the eastern suburbs of Yantai, by the mountains and by the sea, with a white main building that is grand, dignified, and elegant. Due to the country's emphasis on education in recent years, this center was built to be comparable to a high-level hotel, ranking among the top ten first-class hotels in Yantai.

Due to just arriving at the camp, Zhang Laoshi looked very tired. I heard that he couldn't buy a seat from Zhengzhou and had been standing all the way to Qingdao and then “standing” to Yantai, his two legs were swollen. I advised him to go back to the room and rest. Then I found that he walked on the brown carpet in the center corridor as if he were crossing a log bridge? His steps were always hesitant, and after repeated trials, he still did not dare to step firmly.

Zhang Laoshi's unusual joy seemed to be uncontrollable. He told me that this was the first time he had seen the North China Plain with his eyes level, sticking his head out of the train for several hours without pulling it back; the first time he saw the sea, he was so excited that his heart was about to jump out, and he couldn't help but find a small seafood restaurant with a companion, and the two of them drank a bottle of “Changzhou White” in one breath!

I, on the other hand, unable to contain the mystery of fate that brought me together with Zhang Laoshi, also acted out of character, chattering on and on, taking many people along, and visiting the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Top Ear Mountain over and over again.

That was truly the most beautiful place in the world! In the morning, the thin mist and fog lingering above the ear of Top Ear Mountain, floating in clusters and wisps, seemed to have been given life. They touched the farmhouses and cow sheds with their skirts, kissing the red flowers and green leaves. Not far away, clusters of dark green bamboo groves, shy and sweet, forever in a drowsy haze…

That place was also truly poor. Poverty and beauty were equally natural and primitive. There was little arable land. In a good year, the grain harvested in a year was only enough to eat for three months. Going down the mountain to buy rice, the price was 4.3 yuan per kilogram, and each grain of rice was like a pearl. The only way to make money was to make paper from bamboo, with eighteen or nineteen primitive processes. All the men in the village used Cai Lun's ancient technology to make bamboo paper. After more than three months, the golden yellow paper was made, carried down the mountain to sell. The profit was thin, not as good as paper, but there was no other way, this was the only commodity economy in the mountains…

The listeners were all attracted by Top Ear Mountain, moved by Zhang Chengbang.

When I talked about the student dormitories on Top Ear Mountain being like cow pens, the walls blackened by coal smoke but neatly written with “Guizhou University!” “Sichuan University!” an old man trembled with excitement, “The children in the mountains, though they have not seen the world, have a firm belief in their hearts. This belief is not to be underestimated. It can make the mountain children unusually listen to the teacher's words, unusually work hard to study, and one day they will definitely ‘achieve the unexpected’!”

A soft-hearted female teacher couldn't bear to listen any longer, suddenly bursting into tears, “Stop, stop!” and ran away to wipe her tears. She really couldn't bear to imagine Zhang Laoshi's home, with nothing but bare walls, not a single grain of rice left in the world, not a trace of modern oil, but the hall was covered with big and small, new and old certificates, like a “golden curtain” shining…

Undoubtedly, tears and excitement were the deepest affirmation and reward for Zhang Laoshi. In the first half of the camp activities, he was extremely excited, always joining in other people's conversations with a loud voice, without any awkwardness of a mountain person just arriving. Going to Weihai to board a warship and go to sea, visiting Liu Gong Island to pay tribute to the statues of the Beiyang Fleet, climbing Penglai to listen to the waves, he called the young and greeted the old. In his unrestrained steps and hearty laughter, there was no lack of joy from the heart.

City teachers did not know what composite teaching was, putting 5 grades of children of different ages in one classroom, how to teach this class? Zhang Laoshi patiently explained his more than twenty years of teaching experience to the other party, interested and eloquent. When talking about the significance of his decades of teaching in the high mountains, he told everyone: One year, a few students from a Buyi village sent to him, when they reached the fifth grade, I let them all pass the district middle school entrance exam. This village had not had a middle school student in decades. What could be more exciting for the mountain people than sending a child out of the mountains, with the hope of getting a “iron rice bowl” from the government in the future?

The parents knew that the teacher would come the next day to give their children the admission notice, and that night they went to the river to catch fish, kill pigs, and hang dogs. In the Qiannan region, dog meat is an indispensable delicacy when entertaining guests. That dog meat boiled in water with soy sauce and chili; that dog paw used to respect the clan chief and the elders; especially the “dog intestine cake” eaten in the mountains, look, it's like this, using bamboo strips to scrape the dog intestines clean, mixing dog blood with glutinous rice and seasoning, stuffing it in, tying both ends, cooking, and then cutting it into slices like sausages to eat. That taste, so comfortable!

Zhang Laoshi was telling people about his pride, his heart was so excited, his big eyes shone with a unique bright light, his face was red, as if all the blood in his body had surged to his face, expressing great excitement and satisfaction.

However, soon, his pride and self-confidence gradually decreased and disappeared, like the ebb of the sea, retreating to some deep part of his body.

According to the arrangement, the summer camp would organize a visit to the West Close Brigade in Muping County, Shandong Province, which had taken off after the Third Plenary Session. A heavy cloud of gloom moved over Zhang Laoshi's head.

One could imagine that after returning from the West Close Brigade, Zhang Laoshi did not sleep all night. That was also a group of people, a group of Chinese farmers who had entered a moderately prosperous life in advance. A famous “begging village” before liberation, it had only been a few years, and 23 agricultural and industrial enterprises had been set up like building blocks on the land of West Close. The brigade built a hospital, hotel, cinema, large ballroom, children's playground, swimming pool, roller skating rink. All 500 households in the brigade had color TVs and refrigerators. 350 households had telephones. The elderly had retirement benefits. There was not a single household in the brigade that was not a millionaire. Someone self-funded the construction of a small villa using the blueprint of a general's house…

It was not that in the past few days Zhang Laoshi had not seen the tall buildings on the coast of the coastal city of Yantai, the dance halls, bars, cafes, taxis that could let people walk on flat ground without taking a single step, and the color TVs, fans, spring mattresses, bathtubs, high-grade toilet paper, small fragrant soaps in the shape of cookies, large floor-to-ceiling glass windows in the hotel, and the remaining fish, shrimp, braised pork thrown away at random at the banquet table. The countryside and the city were completely incomparable! If the mountain people had never thought of comparing their strengths and weaknesses with the city people, then the West Close Brigade compared to Top Ear Mountain really made Zhang Laoshi silent. His expression on his face was no longer as lively as before, and occasionally, there would be a sudden moment…

The mirror of the West Close Brigade made Zhang Chengbang's heart itch, hurt, and cold.

He left the high mountains, walked through the plains, and stood by the sea. Along the way, his eyes faithfully recorded countless colors and countless sounds. After visiting the West Close Brigade, they all gathered together, producing a strong “accumulated effect.” The weight of this force was enough to knock down this sturdy mountain man.

It was as if someone had secretly hurt him. It was as if he had done something wrong yesterday, and today he was hoping to be forgotten in silence.

A person who had just come out of the isolated “Peach Blossom Spring” immediately entered the boiling modern life. The new and the old, the open and the closed, the running and the stopping, the pursuit of money that caused the swelling of material desires and the traditional values of high mountains and wilds, all kinds of friction and collisions must have brought him a shock like being cut by a knife and chopped by an axe. He was a living person, he would judge, he would compare. Facing all the things that suddenly fell into his field of vision, he had to discern, affirm or deny? Accept or reject?

There was one thing I had always wanted to ask Zhang Laoshi but hadn't been able to. This day, I couldn't help but break through this layer of window paper—

“Zhang Laoshi, that time the conference organizer called you, the phone rang for several minutes, you were clearly in the house, why didn't you answer?”

Like a patient who knows he will eventually be cut, after hearing my words, Zhang Laoshi lowered his head in pain more than shame, “To be honest, at that time I had never seen such a new phone, I really didn't know how to use it, so I didn't dare to touch it.”

When I saw Zhang Laoshi, this strong man who had endured a thousand hardships and could be called a hero, reveal his embarrassment to an outsider for the first time, I immediately regretted it, unable to forgive my “knowing but asking.”

Following that, there were some questions I did not dare to ask, and some “rumors,” of course, were about Zhang Chengbang, I did not dare to reveal a single word in front of him. Because among the 100 outstanding teachers from all over the country who participated in this summer camp activity, there were not only people like him, “Varvara,” but also many people who were the vanguard of the first line of educational reform. After expressing their sincere admiration for Zhang Laoshi's dedication, they also revealed layer after layer of deeper thoughts:

Some looked at each other and sighed: These “Varvaras,” tragedy, the tragic color on their bodies is too heavy. They are lamp oil, they are red candles, fate seems to have only arranged for them to burn and sacrifice, but rarely give them the opportunity to replenish, to “improve” themselves. In the end, their students grew up, but they seemed to have shrunk down, they gave their students a shoulder to step on, a shoulder, while they, as the teachers who enlightened others, had no opportunity to understand modernization, did not know how to answer the phone, and even the sound of a flushing toilet would make them jump in fear…

Some shook their heads secretly: Is such “dedication” worth it? Once the mountain children can go to middle school, there is no one who does not want to go to university. Not only Top Ear Mountain, but the situation in the whole country is basically the same—the more backward and poor the place is, the higher the enrollment rate. The combination of knowledge and poverty has already led to the most culturally needed places to send their strength to the places where talents are concentrated, with the result that the population of cities is increasingly expanding while the old, remote, and poor areas are still poor. If mountain education focuses on teaching children more knowledge and skills suitable for local production and life, would it be more cost-effective…

Zhang Laoshi never thought of and could not understand that when he was desperately trying to send one more student out of the mountain for a “good job,” there were some people among those who were also awarded the title of national model worker, doing things that were opposite and contrary to his efforts. They wanted to kick away the shackles of education that only served to promote enrollment and were trying to launch a challenge to traditional education!

However, in the later period of the summer camp, Zhang Laoshi, who had become silent, began to think about some questions that he had never thought of and had never thought of thinking about—

He had been a mountain teacher all his life, and his most outstanding contribution was to personally send batch after batch of disciples down the mountain.

However, had the face of the mountain area changed? Top Ear Mountain was still Top Ear Mountain. 50 years ago, 100 years ago, it was already like this: relying on the land to eat, life and death were all decided by heaven. No! Top Ear Mountain could not be forever without mail and electricity. The farmers of Top Ear Mountain should not forever be away from civilization, living the life of a “Peach Blossom Spring”!

The summer camp ended. Leaders from various levels of the education department came to shake hands and take photos with the outstanding teachers. In the farewell words, they once again highly praised their spirit of dedication.

Zhang Chengbang Laoshi was leaving. He retreated from the coast, retreated from the plains, and was about to climb back up the familiar, isolated mountain that belonged only to him on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.

We parted for the second time. This time, we both knew that there would be no more “fate.” However, I was so looking forward to seeing him again for the third time. It didn't have to be tomorrow, in the not too distant future, I hoped that when we met again, he would give me a great shock.

Finally, there was a concern that made me uneasy.

Returning to the National Education Commission, I heard that a private school teacher from Hunan ended the summer camp, transferred in Beijing, with almost no money left, and checked into a small hotel. In order to save as much money as possible, he asked someone to exchange three pounds of flour tickets in the commission's canteen, carrying a bag of steamed buns back, eating a dry bun and drinking a mouthful of water every day when he returned from outside.

A man in his fifties, with no chance to come to Beijing again, wanted to see Tiananmen Square, the Great Hall of the People, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and the North Sea…

This matter shocked the leaders and many staff members of the commission. These people who had been engaged in education for ten or twenty years listened to the situation of this private school teacher and could not help but shed tears…

Then Zhang Laoshi, how are you doing? Is the money you have enough? If you suddenly fall ill, do you have medicine to save your life?

For the sake of China's mountain education, you have paid too much. Today, you have also taken away such heavy thoughts. As an insider, what can I do for you?

Silently waiting. Silently blessing. Silently remembering you and your Top Ear Mountain…

第6版(文学作品)
专栏：国庆报告文学征文

　　山野斯人
　　长江
    情形正好应该相反。
    横竖也不该由他从田埂儿上跑过来，两只急于表示欢迎和感激的手臂端得笔直——他是全国劳模！
    是他把一批批苗族、布依族之后送入中学、大学！
    是他把文化、文明的火种遍染座座高山远岭、木屋竹楼！
    累月积年的挚诚已然是一首动地感天之诗！快些，大步流星迎上去一吐钦佩叹服感激感谢的应当是我。可是，他已经跑过来，泥头巴脚的一群弟子追尾其后，正在穿过那条被油菜花黄挤就的赭色田埂儿……
    三小时后，山脚下的那泓山溪变得细如羊肠，更像少女随意系在脖颈被风吹开的银色飘带。张承邦的木屋楼还隐在山巅不知何处。
      “这顶耳山究竟有多高？名字是张老师起的吗？”
    向导说：“哪个晓得。山顶上几平方公里大小的绿草坪子多的是。很像人的平顶头。顶耳山寨就在‘头’的下面，耳朵眼儿的位置。所以唦！”
      “路不好走哇。老师下山，娃儿们上山，需得好脚力。”
      “是唦。60年代虎狼出没。张老师刚把学校撑起来，有了问题下山向人请教，手里断不了一根棍，打草惊蛇，也当拐杖用。”
    一支脆亮的山歌，像鸟儿在草丛中突然刺向白云。
      “准是别的山寨的苗家妹子上山来读书了。”话语不多却出言准确的向导告诉我。
    果然，歌声越飘越近。近了便更动听，听得让人浑身都觉得舒舒坦坦。
    远在省城，我就从档案上看到过。自打张老师把个顶耳山民校办得远近闻名，山下的乡中心完小也比不过它（完小的学生考不上县里面最高学府——县一中，顶耳山张老师的竹棚小学却有弟子金榜题名），远远近近，不同山寨的人就相继把娃娃送到顶耳山来。有苗族的，有布依族的；有本区的，有外区的；有要走十几二十里山路，也有要走四五十里甚至百八十里山路的。这些娃娃不仅学在顶耳山，而且吃在顶耳山，住在顶耳山。
    三个苗家妹子，身上穿着花布衣，头上顶着一方白帕子，像顶着一小片白云，已经扭扭地爬近了我们。她们每人肩上都挑着东西。一根又短又直的木扁担挑着一前一后两个大筐。没发现有人故意躲在山石背后正等着她们，歌就不停地唱，一挨转过一道梁子看见了生人，便本能地把歌停了。
    我起身盛赞她们的歌喉，询问她们筐里装的大米、蔬菜，是给自己寄宿吃的，还是家里一时凑不上款子，大人让她们带给老师的“工资”？
    三个小姑娘笑着不住点头，但说不清是肯定我的第一个判断还是第二个抑或两个目的都有。新中国建立四十年来，散布在南北西东山野水乡的民办教师已发展到300万人之多，这些人承担着全国普及小学教育50％以上的任务，他们每个月可以从国家钱袋里取走的生活费只有19元。有的地区经济条件好，学生家长能拿出一些钱来为老师及他的一家人帮帮伙，条件不好的，张家能出一把米，李家能出一把菜、一把盐也就不错。
    顶耳山民校终于再也藏不住了。
    恰如现代派艺术刻意归真返朴，追求事物的本原。学校土坯为墙，原木为柱。每一项建筑材料都不挂一丝装饰，一任它的天然形状、色泽、纹理昭然。黑板，本山木所制，不是严格的长方形，但比起插在教室黄土地上的木桌木凳，称得上是标准化了。
    教室外头，水田边上，有一块人工开出还翻着新土的平地，这是张老师为孩子们开辟的篮球场。场地一端，照猫画虎竖立着一个小型篮球架。
    我问寄宿的学生住在哪里。张老师不断指点着这，那，然后象征性地带我参观了一处破败的根本无法想象人可以居住的小木屋。这是一间潮湿度和阴暗度都无以复加的宿舍，学生有的睡在一尺高的炕上，有的因地方小睡在地上，有人以棉当褥，也有人以草当褥。屋里地当间，是一个脸盆大小冬天用来御寒烤火的火塘，烟雾的痕迹无所不在地熏烤着室内四壁。
    说实话，我在国家教育中心部门工作，像这样的办学条件，不能说闻所未闻，却是见所未见。
    心在往下沉。张老师看我这副样子连忙给我打气：“条件是苦了一些，但比比过去，我们现在起码能踏踏实实办学，有了宿舍，有了教室，有了操场……”一脸的知足满意。
      “过去”，我知道，在张老师心里压着一个比任何艰难困苦都沉重无数倍的“过去”。那是一个口袋，里边装着陈年的牺牲、奉献，也装着辛酸、屈辱。
      “日子苦，咱不怕。半年饱，半年饥的日子山里人过了几辈子了，习惯了。可咱办学不就是为了给高山传播文化，改变家乡落后，救人出苦海？为啥这条路这么不好走……”
    入夜，坐在张老师的木屋里，我展开笔记本。一只由墨水瓶改做的小油灯发散着微弱的光芒，几扇白天用木棍支开权作窗户采光的木板关闭了，木屋里的黑暗围噬着闪烁不定的火苗，黑色的大山又压迫着木屋。
    张承邦祖籍江西。汉人。上数七八代，祖宗曾做过清河郡的郡守。因府库失窃，损官折禄，充军入黔。以后张家长年受辱于地方一大姓家族。曾祖欲写状子告官，这才发现家中书香烟火早已断灭。悲痛欲绝，痛定思痛，留下遗言：
  “请私塾。日后张家香火不断私塾先生就要养在家里！”
    张承邦从小生活在这样的“小气候”中，在私塾先生的棍棒下长大，虽然顶耳山地处荒僻、远离人烟，中华民族传统文化的血液却得以在他的血管里涌动、奔流。
    1963年，张承邦在县中学毕业。老师想留他给学校当工友，换个城市户口，将来再不用回高山受苦。可张承邦没干。他要考师范继续升学，在师范里学知识、学办学、学怎么做“教书先生”，然后“衣锦还乡”在顶耳山办个“洋学堂”。梦做成了，师范考上了。接到录取通知的那天，承邦高兴得山坡上山坡下打滚狂笑高叫，大山一遍遍不厌其烦地给了他祝贺的回音，全寨人也都像家家得了宝似的。第二天张承邦就揣上几个糯米粑粑，包了两条当地最好的“朝阳桥”牌香烟去公社开入学介绍信。他像一只知道自己定会长出铁翅翱翔天际的雏鹰，心中充溢着蓬勃的自豪和快意。然而，没想到到了公社，找到一位分管教育的书记，信却没开出来——富农的崽子还想上师范？！能上完中学已经够便宜你的了！去，给我回家好好劳动去！
    夜深了。山里的夜才是货真价实的漆黑闷人。狼在山中无助地冲着星空嗥叫。张承邦一家人，叔叔哥哥还有堂兄堂弟，这会儿正合家围拢在地当间的火塘边，等着小承邦走通了“朝阳”大道好把介绍信带回家。谁想到一天一夜水米未打牙的承邦一头闯进屋，疯疯痴痴地二话不说嚎啕大哭，把个被子蒙住头一躺下就是好几天，死了人一样……
    顶耳山天然与世隔绝。不通电不通邮。如果有谁想把一句话一粒米运到山上去，就得舍出25张一毛钱一张的人民币票子雇个脚夫。人类大踏步向着繁荣昌盛进军的号角传不进去，现代生产生活的信息传不进去，却没有一场运动遗忘了这个长在大山耳朵眼儿里的小山寨，大跃进、四清、文革……
    张承邦昏睡了好几天，醒来，肚子里的念头还是放不下。不让我上师范，我也要办学！办不起“洋学堂”就办“土”的。文革后私塾先生都被赶下山了，寨子里几十户人家的孩子整日在山坡沟坎里“放羊”，孩子们耽误不起呀。作为富农，承邦的父亲临死时留下了几间木屋（全部财产），老五承邦卖掉了属于他的那一间，换了一百块钱，那钱原是为支付自己上师范的几年费用的，现在全部用来充任办学基金。
    1964年正月初四，火红的一个大太阳爬上了张承邦叔叔堂屋的木窗棂（承邦卖掉房子后，就住在叔叔家里）。顶耳山自盘古开天辟地以来第一所学校，随着一阵噼叭炸响的野爆竹诞生了。12个学生，最大的14岁（只比承帮小两岁）；最幺的才4岁。以后课上一半，这老幺儿还要举手打报告让老师放他回家吃咪咪——奶。
    不管怎么说，学校一办起来，就是事业的开始。在张承邦眼里，这份事业绝不亚于东升的那轮太阳辉煌神圣。太阳每天都要升起，学校也得每天按时传出书声。他把卖掉房子的一百元钱拿出来为他的首届“12大弟子”买了语文书、算术书。教室就设在叔叔的堂屋，学生的课桌就是他们的小膝盖，自带板凳。承邦上小学时父亲送给他的一块二尺长的小黑板现在派上了用场，每天都要和着上课的钟声一起挂在木板墙上。
    25年，没有“天子御旨”，没有谁给过他一分钱建校资金、办学经费，初始甚至没有人给他一分钱报酬，一分钱生活费。他建了这所小学，拢着这所小学。四清来了，工作组还是那句话，
  “富农怎么可以教贫农？！”学校解散；文革来了，他头上又顶上“毒害贫下中农子弟”的帽子。学校先后被派来十几个顶替他的“信得过的”教师，却十几次打了铺盖卷耐不住高山的艰苦而下山。只有张承邦像水中的浮球，没有封压他就要冒出头来，就要教学办学送学生出深山。25年来，他满怀痴情带出了一届又一届品学兼优的学生，这些人，有的念了中专，有人念了大专、本科，也有人继承他的衣钵回顶耳山做了第二代高山文化播种人……
    真是人生何处不相逢。
    那年离开顶耳山，主人把我送出很远很远。一根专为我准备的青竹手杖塞过来：“此别难见。下山路陡，一定要用它拄着。”谁知一年后，在烟台全国优秀教师夏令营彼此还能再聚。惊讶和兴奋不无天意的神秘。
    也许到会的人只我一个知道，如若张承邦老师没有成为全国教育系统劳动模范，他会连自己的黔南苗族、布依族自治州州府是个什么样子都不知道，更没去过省城，出过省界。今天，他斜垮了半个中国，看到了平原、大海；吃上了山珍海味；用上了最现代化的生活设施——
    一个高山土生土长的泥腿子教师，他单纯的心里盛得下这么多“刺激”吗？
    我耳不由倾听，眼不由跟踪，随之亢奋，为之荣耀，也朦朦胧胧有一点杞人忧天。
    天果真不会掉下来？
    或被什么利器戳出个窟窿？
    他还是老样子，裹一身高山生活的印迹，更把一层由于事业成功无愧高山满可以自豪的色彩调进那印迹里。粗壮有力的四肢，过于结实而显得不算高大的身量，黧黑的面膛，被太阳烙得尤其黑得出奇的后脖梗子，向前突凸的脑门儿，包藏着尚且没有被远山冷野吞没了的智慧和形成这智慧的士大夫永不泯灭的遗传基因，还有那一双自幼看惯了大山，从此便看什么都不知道回避的如光柱般闪亮的大眼睛。
    国家教委学术活动中心设在烟台东郊，依山傍海，白色的主体大方庄重华贵雍容。由于这几年国家重视教育，才把这座中心盖得可以和高级宾馆媲美，排入烟台十大甲级宾馆的行列。
    由于刚到营地，张老师显得很疲惫。听说到了郑州就买不上座位，他是一路站到青岛又转“站”烟台，两条腿都站肿了。我劝他赶快回房间休息。接着我发现他走在中心楼道棕色的地毯上怎么有点像过独木桥？步子总是犹犹豫豫，反复试探之后还是不敢踩实。
    张老师的异常高兴看来是难以自制的。他告诉我他第一次放平了目光看到华北大平原，坐在火车上把头伸出去几小时没收回来；头一眼看到大海，兴奋得心直往外窜，忍不住和同伴找了家小小的海味饭馆，两人一口气喝干了一瓶“常州白”！
    我呢，由于装不下和张老师重逢这份天意的神秘，也一反常态，叙叙叨叨把许多人都带上，到云贵高原、到顶耳山转了一遭又一遭。
    那真是人间最美的地方！清晨，沉积在顶耳山耳朵眼儿上空的薄云雾霭，一团团一缕缕飘动着，像被赋予了生命，她们用裙角抚触着农舍、牛棚，亲吻着红花绿叶。不远处一簇簇墨绿的楠竹林，含羞含蜜，永远朦胧欲睡……
    那地方也真穷。贫困和美丽一样的自然原始。耕地少。年成好，一年打下的粮食也只够吃3个月。下山买米，议价一斤4毛3，粒米如珍珠。唯一的生财之路是碎竹制纸，十八九道原始工艺，全寨的男人用当年蔡伦的手艺去打楠竹的主意。三个多月的功夫，黄灿灿的草纸做好了，扛到山下去卖，利薄不如纸，没办法，这便是山里唯一的商品经济……
    听的人都被顶耳山吸引了，被张承邦感动了。
    听我说到顶耳山上的学生宿舍如牛栏一般，被煤火熏得天然黑板一样的墙上却工工整整写着
  “贵州大学！”“四川大学！”一位老者激动地颤抖双手：“山里孩子虽没见过大世面，但他们心里却有着一个坚定的信念。这信念非同小可。它能让山里娃出奇地听老师的话、出奇地拚命读书，有朝一日一定能‘出奇制胜’！”
    一位心软的女教师听我讲着讲着，突然忍不住：“别说了，别说了！”一个人跑开去抹起了泪水。她实在不忍想象，张老师家是怎样的家徒四壁，满世界找不出一口袋隔夜粮，寻不着一点现代化的油星儿，而堂屋里却贴着大大小小新新旧旧一面墙奖状，像“金帘子”一样闪光……
    无疑，眼泪和激动不已是对张老师最深层的肯定和奖赏。整个营期活动的前半部分，他极其兴奋，总是洪声大嗓地加入别人的谈话，一点没有山里人初来乍到的生分。到威海坐军舰出海，去刘公岛瞻仰北洋水师大人们的塑像，登临蓬莱观海听涛，他喊上小的招呼上老的。扬扬洒洒的步子里，痛痛快快的笑声中，无不透出发自内心的愉悦。
    城里的年轻教师不知道什么叫复式教学，要将5个年级、年龄参差不齐的孩子放在一个教室里，这课怎么上？张老师就耐心地将自己二十多年的教学经验讲给对方，兴趣盎然，滔滔不绝。谈到自己几十年置身高山教书育人的意义，他告诉大伙：有一年，一个布依族山寨送来的几个学生，上到五年级，我让他们全考取了区里的中学。这寨子几十年没出过一个中学生。山里人有什么能比得上把个娃儿送出山，将来有希望端上官家的“铁饭碗”更高兴的呢？
    家长们知道第二天老师要来给自己的娃儿送录取通知书，当夜就下河摸鱼，杀猪吊狗。黔南地区的山里人请客，狗肉是必不可少的佳肴。那沾上酱油和辣椒吃的白水煮狗肉；那只用来敬奉族长和老人的狗爪；特别不能不提的还有山里吃的“狗东粑”，瞧，就是这样，用篾条把狗肠子刮得干干净净，将狗血拌糯米加佐料灌进去，两头扎上结，煮熟，然后像香肠一样切成片来吃。那滋味，好安逸唦！
    张老师在向人们演讲自己的骄傲，心情好激动，一双大眼睛放着如柱的独特的亮光，脸红红的，仿佛全身的血液都涌到面部，表示着巨大的兴奋和欣慰。
    然而，不久，他的骄傲和自豪渐渐少了，消失了，如大海退潮，退到他的躯体的某个深部去了。
    按照安排，夏令营要组织参观三中全会以后腾飞起来的山东省牟平县西关大队。一片沉重的灰云移临到张老师头顶。
    可以想象，从西关大队回来，张老师是怎样通宵未眠。那也是一群人，一群提前进入小康生活的中国农民。解放前有名的“要饭村”，这才几年，23个农工企业像摆积木一样在西关大地立了起来。队里盖了医院、宾馆、电影院、大舞厅、儿童乐园、游泳池、旱冰场。全队500户人家，家家有彩电、冰箱。350户有电话。老了都有退休金。全队没有一户人家不是万元户。有人自费盖的小洋楼竟用的是将军楼的图纸……
    并非这几日张老师没有看到海滨城市烟台那一座座高耸的楼厦，那舞厅酒吧咖啡馆，那可以让人在平地上也一步都不用走的出租汽车，还有宾馆里的彩电风扇席梦思浴缸高级手纸饼干状小香皂大落地玻璃窗，饭桌宴会上随意扔掉的剩鱼剩虾红烧肉。农村和城市根本没有可比性！如果说山里人从来不想和城里人比个你长我短，那么，西关大队和顶耳山相比却着实把张老师比沉默了。他脸上的表情没有了往日的活泼，间或，还会出现蓦蓦然的一瞬一瞬……
    西关大队的一面镜子，照痒了照疼了照寒了张承邦的心。
    他离开高山，走过平原，置身海滨，一路上眼睛所忠实记录下来的无数种色彩，无数种声音，等到参观完了西关大队，便统统聚集到一起，产生了强大的“积累效力”，这力的沉重足以将他这山里长大的墩实汉子压倒。
    像有谁暗中悄悄伤害了他。像他昨天做错了什么事，今天正以缄口的方式希望尽快被人们忘掉。
    一个刚刚从远离人烟封闭的“桃花源”里走出来的人，马上闯入沸腾的现代生活，崭新与古老，开放与闭合，飞跑与停顿，一切向钱看所造成的物欲膨胀和高山静岭孤高守节的传统价值观念，种种摩擦碰撞对他必然带来刀切斧砍般的震慑。他是活人，会判断、有比较。面对一切突然跌入他视野的事物，他得鉴别，肯定还是否定？接受还是排斥？
    有件事，一直想问张老师而未能。这天，我还是忍不住捅透了这层窗户纸——
      “张老师，那次会务组给你打电话，电话铃响了好几分钟，你明明在屋里，为什么没接？”
    像病人知道早晚要挨一刀，听完我的话张老师痛苦大于羞涩地低下了头：“不瞒你说，那时候我还没见过这种新式电话，根本不知道怎么使用，所以没有敢去摸它。”
    当我看到张老师这位忍受了生活的千百种磨难堪称刚强的汉子第一次向外人流露他的窘促，我马上后悔，不能原谅自己的“明知故问”。
    接下去还有些疑问我便不好再开口，还有些“传闻”，当然是有关张承邦的，我更不忍在他面前透出一点风来。因为参加本次夏令营活动的全国百名优秀教师之中，不光有像他这样的“瓦尔瓦拉”，还有不少人属于冲杀在教育改革第一线的先锋战士，他们在对张老师的献身精神表示出真诚的感佩之后，还流露出了一层层更深的思考：
    有人相视而叹：这些“瓦尔瓦拉”呀，悲剧，身上的悲剧色彩太浓。他们是灯油，是红蜡，命运仿佛只安排给他们燃烧和奉献，却很少给他们以补给，以自身“改良”的机会。到头来，他们的学生长大了，他们却显得低矮了下去，他们给学生垫过去的永远是肩膀，是肩膀，而自己虽为人启蒙之师，却没有机会懂得现代化，不会接电话，甚至抽水马桶的响动也会反复地吓他们一跳……
    有人暗暗摇头：如此“奉献”下去值不值得？山里孩子一旦能考上中学，没有不想上大学的。不仅顶耳山，全国情况基本趋同——越落后贫穷的地方升学率越相对的高。知识和贫困构成的反向组合已经导致了最需要文化的地方越痴情地往人才密集之地输送力量，其结果呢？城市人口日益膨胀而老少边穷依然贫困。山区教育如果以多教给孩子们一些适应当地生产生活需要的知识和技能是否更划算一些……
    张老师不曾想到也无法理解，正当他拚命为多送一个学生出山“高就”而热血沸腾的时候，像他一样被评为全国劳动模范的人当中，竟有一些在干着与他的努力相反相悖的事情，他们要踢开教育只为升学服务的羁绊，正试图来一场向传统教育的挑战！
    不过，在夏令营后期，哑声细语了的张老师已经开始思考一些他过去从来不想，也想不到去想的问题——
    他做了一辈子山野教书匠，他的贡献最突出的体现在亲手把一批批弟子送下高山。
    然而山区的面貌改变了吗？顶耳山还是顶耳山。50年前100年前就已经是这样：凭土地吃饭，生死全由天。不！顶耳山不能永世不通邮不通电。顶耳山的农民也不该永远远离文明，过“世外桃园”的日子！
    夏令营结束。各级教育部门的领导都来和优秀教师握手、合影。欢送的话语中又一次次对他们的奉献精神给予了极高的赞扬。
    张承邦老师要走了。他退出海滨，退出平原，又要爬上云贵高原那座他熟悉的、与世隔绝只属于他的高山上去。
    我们第二次分手。此一分，彼此都明白再不会有“天意”。然而，我是多么期待着与他能有第三次见面。不必就在明天，在不太远的将来，我盼望着再次相见时他会给我一个天大的震惊。
    最终，还有一分担心令我不安。
    回到国家教委，听说一位湖南民办教师结束了夏令营，在北京中转，身上钱票所剩无几，住进一家小旅店。为了尽可能节省开支，他求人在教委食堂换了三斤面票，将一口袋馒头拎回，每日从外边回来，吃一口干馍喝一口水。
    50多岁的人了，没机会再来北京，要看看天安门、大会堂、北海故宫颐和园……
    此事惊动了教委领导和不少工作人员。这些十几年几十年搞教育的人听了这位民办教师的境况，一个个禁不住泪落潸潸……
    那么张老师你呢，走的好吗？身上的盘缠够不够用？万一生了急病有没有救命的药品？
    为了中国的山区教育，你付出的太多了。今天，你还带走了那么沉重的思考。作为一个知情人，我能为你做些什么？
    默默地期待。默默地祝福。默默地将你和你的顶耳山记住……
