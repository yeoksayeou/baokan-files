Title: Reward or Burden?

	These quilts and bedsheets are part of the physical rewards received by an advanced producer from a certain unit over the past few years. This advanced producer is over fifty years old. He said that these are what remained after he gave some to his children. If each item is used for two years, these quilts and bedsheets would last him over 40 years. He said, "If I sell them, people might say I don't cherish the 'honor'; if I keep them, I'm afraid they might get infested with bugs and become a burden. I'm really at a loss!"

	With the consent of this advanced producer, I took this photo to provide some material for leaders to consider when improving the reward system.

### 奖品乎？包袱乎？（图片）

    奖品乎？包袱乎？
    这些线毯、床单，是某单位一位先进生产者近几年来所得的部分实物奖品。这位先进生产者年已五十有余。据他说，这还是在分给子女一些以后剩下的。估算一下，如每件使用期为两年，这些线毯、床单少说也够他用40多年的。他说：“卖了吧，怕人家说这人不珍惜‘荣誉’；收着吧，又怕虫蛀，倒成了包袱，实在左右为难！”征得这位先进生产者的同意，我拍了这张照片，供领导们改进奖励制度时思考。
