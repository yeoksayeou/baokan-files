Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 17th.

The much-anticipated north-south traffic artery that connects the eastern part of ancient Beijing, the "East Wing Project," has been fully completed and was officially handed over to the relevant departments for management today.

The project commander, Huang Jicheng, introduced that the "East Wing Project" starts from Dongbianmen in the north, goes south through Guangqumen, Jingsong, Zuo'anmen, Puyanglu, and reaches the intersection of Liujiayao Road. From there, it goes east to Chengshousi Road and then west to Muxiyuan Road, with a total length of 13.4 kilometers. The main road has 6 lanes for fast traffic, with wide lanes for slow traffic on both sides or one side. Along the route, 10 overpasses, 12 pedestrian bridges, and 5 underpasses have been built. Along with the road and bridge construction, the drainage channel from Longtan Sluice to Dongbianmen has been improved. Nine types of underground pipelines, including water, gas, heat, electricity, and telecommunications, have also been laid simultaneously.

The project began in August 1987 and is the largest comprehensive municipal construction project since the founding of the nation.
