	CPPCC members have shown great concern for clean governance, and related proposals have all been implemented. According to the Xinhua News Agency, some CPPCC members have submitted proposals regarding the construction of clean governance, which have received attention from relevant departments of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council. By now, these proposals have all been replied to and implemented.

	Members Yang Ximen and Ma Pinfang proposed in their proposal that it is necessary to continuously improve and perfect the legal system during the process of system reform, so as to have laws to follow; for those who violate laws and disciplines, they must be investigated for violations. The State Supervision Department has responded.

	The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, in its reply to the proposal by member Yang Ximen titled "Suggesting the use of national laws to deal with officials within the ruling party who abuse their power for personal gain," stated that the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has made a decision to further require the disciplinary inspection agencies at all levels of the Party to, when giving disciplinary actions to Communist Party members who have committed serious violations of discipline and law, work closely with relevant judicial departments according to their division of labor, share information, cooperate with each other, and hand over relevant materials according to relevant regulations. For Party members who need to be dealt with criminally after being given disciplinary actions, they will be dealt with by judicial organs according to law.

	The proposals submitted by members Cui Weiyue and Qian Junwei, which call for strengthening and improving the supervision organs and leadership system, as well as the proposals by Wu Daguan, Feng Zhi, and Feng Bin regarding the fact that the construction of clean governance should start from the leaders, have also received attention from the relevant handling units.
