Seoul court sentences Mun Ik-hwan to ten years in prison

According to a broadcast by Seoul Radio, the South Korean court sentenced Mun Ik-hwan, a Christian pastor who had secretly visited North Korea to promote national reunification, to ten years in prison on October 5.

Mun Ik-hwan, who is already 70 years old, secretly visited Pyongyang in March without the permission of the Seoul authorities. The Seoul District Court accused Mun Ik-hwan of violating the National Security Law, stating that his trip to the North caused social disorder in South Korea. Liu Won-ho, who also visited Pyongyang with Mun Ik-hwan, was also sentenced to ten years in prison on the same day.
