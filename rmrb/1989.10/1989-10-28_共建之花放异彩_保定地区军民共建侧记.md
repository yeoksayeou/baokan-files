The flower of joint construction between the military and civilians blossomed earliest in Hebei Province's Baoding region.

During the turmoil of May and June this year, the cadres and masses here, like sending their sons to the frontlines in the past, showed great trust, support, and understanding for the troops executing martial law.

When a certain unit of the martial law troops passed through Xushui County, it was already past 11 PM. Food vendor Li Xiu Shen, upon learning that the troops had not eaten, immediately mobilized all the staff in his shop to cook for the troops. After seeing the soldiers eat well, he carefully filled each soldier's canteen with water and sent them off on their way.

It is understood that during this period, the Baoding Regional Committee, Administrative Office, and Military Sub-region jointly formed 3 delegation teams, and various cities and counties organized delegation groups to visit the families of martial law troops and left-behind cadres and soldiers, delivering 5,500 kilograms of rice and flour, over 10,000 kilograms of vegetables, 1,200 kilograms of meat, and a large number of other daily necessities. The entire region organized over 700 youth militia service teams, mainly composed of young militia members, to wash over 1,000 sets of bedding for the troops and help the families of cadres and soldiers executing martial law with summer harvesting and planting over 4,600 acres.

In the 8 years of joint construction, the military and local authorities have adhered to the principle of considering each other's needs and benefits, supporting each other, and fostering deep affection.

In 1986, a pine caterpillar infestation occurred in the original forest area of Damaoshan in Tang County, threatening the destruction of the forest. Upon learning of this, a certain unit of the garrison troops proactively dispatched two battalions to participate in the pest control battle. After 72 days of hard work, they finally controlled the pine caterpillar infestation, saving the original forest in the Taihang Mountains. The selfless assistance of the garrison troops deeply moved the people of Tang County. Last winter, when coal supply was tight, to ensure the needs of the local garrison troops, Tang County transported 2,000 tons of coal from outside and supplied 600 tons at a price of 52 yuan less per ton to the unit.

In July this year, Wanzhou County suffered a rare severe flood disaster. A certain unit of the garrison troops quickly dispatched over 500 officers and soldiers to organize rescue efforts. In the 8 days and nights in Wanzhou, they repaired 22 breaches in the Qu River embankment, filled and stacked over 26,000 sandbags, moved 13,000 cubic meters of soil, rescued 750,000 kilograms of grain, and 5 medical teams treated over 10,000 local residents. To help the disaster-stricken people restore production, the officers and soldiers also donated 180,000 yuan.

An old man who had carried stretchers for the People's Army in the war years said with deep emotion: "In those wartime days, it was like this. Now it's still the good old traditions of the Eighth Route Army!"

　　共建之花放异彩
　　——保定地区军民共建侧记
　　郭嘉　成福　王渊
    河北省保定地区是军民共建之花最早盛开的地方。
    在今年动乱的5、6月间，这里的干部群众像当年送子弟兵上前线一样，对执行戒严任务的部队表现出极大的信任、支持和理解。
    戒严部队某部途经徐水县时，已是夜间11点多了，饮食专业户李秀申得知部队还没吃饭，立即动员全店人员，给部队做饭。看着战士们吃好饭后，他又细心地给每位战士灌满军壶水，并欢送他们上了路。
    据了解，这期间，保定地委、行署、军分区联合组成了3个慰问团，各市县组织了慰问小组，对戒严部队官兵家属及其留守干部战士逐一进行了慰问，送去米面5500公斤、蔬菜1万多公斤、肉类1200公斤以及大批其它生活用品。全区组织了以青年民兵为主体的拥军服务小组700多个，为部队拆洗被褥上千件，帮助执行戒严任务的干部战士家庭夏收夏种4600多亩。
    保定地区在8年的共建中，军地双方本着替对方着想、为对方谋利的原则，相濡以沫，彼此间结下了深厚的情谊。
    1986年，唐县大茂山原始林区发生松毛虫害，森林面临毁灭的危险。驻军某部得知这一情况后，主动派出两个营的兵力，参加灭虫战斗。经过72天奋战，终于控制住了松毛虫，保住了太行山区这片原始森林。驻军的无私相助，深深感染着唐县人民。去年冬天，煤炭供应紧张，为了保证当地驻军之需，唐县从外地调运了2000吨煤，并以每吨少52元的价格供给该部队600吨。
    今年7月，完县遭受了历史上罕见的特大洪涝灾害，驻军某部迅速派出500多名官兵组织抢险。在完县的8个日日夜夜里，他们抢堵曲逆河大堤决口22处，装、填、垛起草袋2.6万多个，动土1.3万立方米，抢出粮食75万公斤，5个医疗队救治了当地群众万余人次。为帮助灾区人民恢复生产，干部战士还主动捐款1.8万元。
    一位在战争年代为人民军队抬过担架的老大爷深有感触地说：“打仗那年月就是这样子，如今还是老八路的好传统啊！”
