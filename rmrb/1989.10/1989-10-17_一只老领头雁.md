My father is a true farmer. From the early days of liberation until the early 1980s, he served nearly 30 years as the Party branch secretary of the production brigade. Although he only attended four years of private school and his education level was not very high, I admire him greatly.

Our village has over 100 households and more than 600 people. The production brigade is divided into four production teams. This scale is considered a medium-sized village in our area. From the time I was old enough to understand, I knew that our village was one of the wealthiest and most advanced in the county, receiving several banners each year, from the commune, the county, and even the province. Several times, we were awarded provincial-level advanced titles. A production brigade office of about 50-60 square meters has its walls covered in red and green banners. When I went to play there, I would always look up at these awards, such as "Advanced Collective," "Model Party Branch," "Battle Fortress," and so on. The brigade has many awards, and our home also has many, all given to my father. Titles like "Labor Model," "Excellent Party Branch Secretary," "Model Party Member," and so on. Every time Father brought home an award, he would be overjoyed, hanging it neatly on the wall under Chairman Mao's portrait. Relatives and friends would come to admire them, then show expressions of admiration. Especially during the New Year and festivals, when friends from all directions came, hearing and seeing the thriving scene of our brigade and my father's long row of awards, they would spread the word. Thus, our brigade and my father became famous far and wide. When going to the county city, mentioning our brigade and my father, nine out of ten people would know. People from the three surrounding villages, when passing by our village, would point and comment, often with a hint of envy, praising our brigade and my father. At the end, they would sigh, "When will our village have such a Party branch secretary?" Every time I heard these words, I felt delighted, and my father's image in my heart grew taller. I often secretly observed his rough hands and large, black feet; his sparse hair, wondering how such an ordinary person could win so many awards for the brigade and for himself.

As I grew older, I gradually understood the secrets behind it.

On the construction sites of leveling fields, building reservoirs, and digging canals, countless nights and days, Father was always working under the stars and moonlight. The villagers would say, "Look at the secretary's red eyes from staying up all night, how can we bear not to work hard?!" Area, commune, and county officials coming to find Father, whether asking the adults or children in the village, they would say:
"Go to that construction site, he's sure to be there!" In a year, Father, excluding attending meetings in the county and commune, actually worked more than 300 days. Mother said, "Your father treats the house like a hotel, look at his bowl, even a gunshot couldn't hit it; only when hungry and tired does he remember there's a home." Father just smiled apologetically.

The brigade has two lime kilns producing over 20 tons a day. Piles of white lime are like mountains. When the family needed to build a stove, Mother went to the kiln to carry a load of lime. Father found out and told the brigade accountant to record it, deducting points at the end of the year. The accountant said, "The brigade has plenty of lime, why does the secretary have to pay for using some?" Father said, "If I set this example, how can I manage others? If everyone takes from the collective without paying, even a mountain of gold and silver will be eaten up!" The accountant was convinced, and the villagers were convinced. Without anger, he commands respect; without words, he gains trust. Father's words, the villagers listen, and even those who are criticized feel relieved.

During festivals, Father would always visit those households still facing difficulties and the five-guarantee households, understanding what they still lacked and what the brigade needed to help solve. He would have Mother often make sweet potato and pumpkin porridge, sending the saved grains to the households in need. After the brigade adjusted the production relationship and implemented the household contract responsibility system, it enhanced the production enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of each household, and the living standards of most farmers in our village greatly improved on the original basis. To help a small number of households get out of poverty, Father repeatedly visited the relatively wealthy farmers and those still relatively poor to understand the situation and study how to further improve the production responsibility system. He also went with the village head to various contracted sideline and industrial enterprises to investigate production conditions, obtaining firsthand data, making the contracts and taxes paid to the village reasonable, and ensuring the village had a solid material foundation. This way, public welfare projects and helping households in need had a certain amount of funds. He also led the more than twenty Party members in the village, mobilizing some League members and young people, organizing a "mutual aid team." During busy farming seasons, each person would do a few days of voluntary work, helping households lacking labor and those with intellectual disabilities to rush harvests and plantings. Father said, "The Communist Party encourages capable people to get rich, but we cannot just watch those in difficulty go hungry. I am the Party branch secretary, doing this is not just representing myself, but embodying the Party's purpose, bringing the Party's warmth to everyone."

He is like a lead goose, leading the flock to fly towards prosperity. Such old Party members are not just thousands in our country's rural areas.

    一只老领头雁
    潘海生
    我父亲是个地地道道的农民。从解放初期到80年代初，当了近30年的大队党支部书记。他虽然只上过4年私塾，文化程度不很高，可我十分敬佩他。
    我们村有100多户人家，600余人口。一个大队划分为4个生产小队。这个规模，在我们那个地方算是中等村子了。从我懂事起，就知道我们村在全县已经是数一数二的富裕、先进村，每年都要领回好几面锦旗，有公社的、县里的，曾经有好几次还获得省一级的先进称号。一个五六十平方米的大队办公室，四壁挂得红红绿绿。有时去那里玩，我总要仰着头把这些奖状看个遍，什么“先进集体”啦，“模范党支部”啦，“战斗堡垒”啦等等。队里挂了许多奖状，我们家里也挂了大小奖状，这些自然是奖给我父亲的。什么“劳动模范”、“优秀党支部书记”、“模范党员”，等等。父亲每次捧着奖状回来，总是兴高采烈，端端正正地挂在正堂毛主席像的左右两方下边墙壁上。亲戚朋友来，总要逐个欣赏一番，然后露出钦佩的表情。特别是过年过节，有朋四方来，耳闻目睹我们大队的一派兴旺景象和我父亲那一长溜的奖状，回去后渲染一番。于是我们大队和我父亲便远近闻名了。上县城，讲起我们那个大队，讲起我父亲，十有八九都知道。上下三村的人路过我们村，总要指指点点，同时不无妒意地夸奖一番，自然，也免不了评论、夸奖一番我父亲，末了，叹口气：“什么时候我们村也有这样一位党支部书记就好了。”每每听到这些话，我心里就乐滋滋的，父亲的形象在我的心里逐渐高大起来。我常常偷偷地打量他那双粗糙的手，又大又黑的脚；打量他那稀疏头发，想不通这样一个平平凡凡的人是怎样为队里、为自己争得这许多奖状的。
    随着年龄增长，耳濡目染，我才明白其中的奥妙。
    在一个个改田造地，筑水库修水渠的工地上，多少个日日夜夜，父亲总是披星踩月。村里人说，你看书记那双熬红了的眼，我们还能忍心不出力么？！区、公社、县上的工作同志来找父亲，无论问村里的大人还是小孩，都会说：
    “偌，到那个工地上去找，准在！”一年下来，父亲除去县、公社开会，实际的劳动天数都在300天以上。母亲说，你父亲把家当旅馆了，看他饭碗一放，连枪也打不着了；饿了、困了才想到有个家。父亲听了，只是歉意地笑笑。
    队里有两个日产20多吨的石灰窑。洁白的石灰堆积如山。家里要砌灶头，母亲去窑里挑了一担石灰。父亲知道了，叫大队会计记了帐，到年底扣分。会计说，队里石灰多的是，你书记用一点还要付钱？父亲说，要是我带了这个头，怎能管人家？大家都白吃白拿集体的，金山银山也会吃空的啊！会计服了，队里的群众也服了。不怒自威，无言立信，父亲的话，队里人听，被批评的人也舒气。
    逢年过节，父亲总是一头钻进那些生活还困难的农户和五保户家里，了解他们还缺少些什么，需要队里帮助解决些什么。他要母亲经常做一些地瓜饭、南瓜饭，把省下来的粮食给困难户送去。队里调整生产关系实行联产承包之后，增强了一家一户的生产热情和责任感，我们村绝大部分农民的生活水平在原来的基础上又大大提高了。为了帮助一小部分农户脱贫，父亲多次找那些较富的农民和还较穷的农民了解情况，研究如何进一步完善生产责任制。他还同村长到一个个已承包下去的工副企业中调查生产情况，掌握第一手资料，使承包的合同、上交的税利订得合乎实际，使村里有一个比较雄厚的物质基础，兴办公共事业和扶持困难户也就有了一定的资金。他还带领全村二十几个党员，发动了一些团员青年，组织“帮工队”，农忙时节每人出几个义务工，帮助缺少劳力和智力迟钝的农户抢收抢种。父亲说，共产党鼓励有能耐的人富起来，但不能眼看那些有困难的人吃不上饭。我是党支部书记，这样做，不是代表我个人，而是体现了党的宗旨，把党的温暖带给大伙。
    他像一只领头雁，领着雁群向富裕飞翔。这样的老党员，在我国农村何止千万。
    我出来读书，后来又在县里工作。那时，父亲因为年龄和身体的原因，不再担任支部书记了。可我总忘不了这只退下来的领头老雁，喜欢听他那朴实的语言，喜欢他那实实在在的行动；也喜欢跟他谈天说地。谈年份收成，谈村里的发展设想，谈国家大事。他根据自身的经历和实践体现党的富民政策。我从县城后来又到省城工作，每次回家，父亲总是叮嘱我：“再忙，也别忘了经常回来走走。不了解农村，怎么谈得上了解中国呢！”
