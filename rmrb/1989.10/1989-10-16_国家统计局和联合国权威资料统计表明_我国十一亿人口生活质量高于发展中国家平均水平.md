    Statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics and the United Nations show that the living standards of China's 11 billion people are above the average of developing countries. According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 15 (Reporter Zhang Chao Wen), how are the lives of the Chinese people? On this question of global concern, the National Bureau of Statistics and the United Nations have given a clear answer: the living standards of the Chinese people are above the average of developing countries. Currently, the living standards of the Chinese people are roughly equivalent to those of middle-income developing countries.

    In terms of nutrition, according to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, in 1985, the average daily food caloric intake per person in China was 2620 calories, higher than the 2460 calories average for developing countries, and close to the world average of 2694 calories.

    In terms of clothing, in 1986, China's per capita fiber consumption was 10.6 kilograms, higher than the 3.8 kilograms average for developing countries.

    In terms of consumption, in 1988, China had 13.2 televisions, 6.2 washing machines, and 1.8 refrigerators per 100 people, equivalent to the level of middle-income developing countries.

    In terms of housing, the per capita living standards in China's urban and rural areas have significantly improved over the past decade, and according to statistics, they are already above the average for developing countries.

    In terms of medical and health care, in 1988, China had 1.62 million doctors, with an average of 676 people served per doctor, between the levels of developed and developing countries, and higher than the average of 4940 people served per doctor in middle-income developing countries.

    With the improvement of people's consumption, education, medical care, and social welfare, the health of the Chinese people has also gradually improved. In 1987, the life expectancy of the Chinese population was 69 years, higher than the 64 years of middle-income developing countries; the infant mortality rate was 32‰, lower than the 56‰ level of middle-income developing countries.

    Economic experts point out that China, with 7% of the world's arable land, feeds 22% of the world's population, solving the problem of hunger for 11 billion people, and the per capita output has reached the level of middle-income developing countries. Moreover, on this basis, significant changes have occurred in the people's clothing, consumption, and medical care, which is a contribution to all of humanity.

    国家统计局和联合国权威资料统计表明
    我国十一亿人口生活质量高于发展中国家平均水平
    据新华社北京10月15日电（记者张超文）中国人的日子过得怎么样？对这一举世关注的问题，国家统计局和联合国的权威资料作了明确回答：我国人民的生活质量高于发展中国家平均水平。目前我国人民的生活质量与中等收入的发展中国家相比，已大体相当。
    营养方面，据联合国粮农组织资料，1985年我国每人每天食物热值为2620大卡，高于发展中国家2460大卡的平均水平，接近2694大卡的世界平均水平。
    穿的方面，1986年我国人均纤维消费量为10.6公斤，高于发展中国家3.8公斤的水平。
    用的方面，1988年我国每百人拥有电视机13.2台、洗衣机6.2台、电冰箱1.8台，相当于中等收入发展中国家的水平。
    住的方面，我国城市和农村人均居住水平近十年有显著提高，据统计，也已高于发展中国家的平均水平。
    医疗保健方面，1988年我国拥有医生162万人，平均每个医生服务人口为676人，介于发达国家与发展中国家之间，高于中等收入发展中国家平均每个医生服务4940人的水平。
    随着人民消费、教育、医疗、社会福利的改善，我国人民的健康素质也逐步提高。1987年，我国人口的预期寿命为69岁，高于中等收入发展中国家的64岁；婴儿死亡率为32‰，低于中等收入发展中国家56‰的水平。
    经济界人士指出，我国以7％的世界耕地，供养22％的世界人口，解决了11亿人口的温饱问题，人均产量达到了中等收入发展中国家的水平。而且在此基础上使人民的穿、用、医疗保健发生巨大变化，这是对全人类的贡献。
