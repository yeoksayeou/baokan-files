	Promoting Full Implementation of Resolution 598
	UN Secretary-General's Envoy Visits Iran and Iraq

	Our correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports from the United Nations on October 27: According to a statement from the UN spokesman today, UN Secretary-General's envoy El-Erian will depart from New York on October 30 to visit the Middle East, making shuttle visits to Baghdad and Tehran, in an attempt to break the current stalemate in resolving the Iran-Iraq conflict.

	Before El-Erian's departure, the Security Council held a consultation meeting this afternoon to review the implementation of Security Council Resolution 598 on the Iran-Iraq conflict. The statement issued after the meeting pointed out that although Iran and Iraq have been implementing a ceasefire for 14 months, no substantial progress has been made in fully implementing this resolution. The Security Council expressed deep concern over this situation.

	The current chairman of the Security Council, Fortier, told reporters that El-Erian's shuttle visits are welcomed by the governments of Iran and Iraq. This is a "beneficial development." He hopes that Iran and Iraq will work constructively in a spirit of goodwill to achieve substantial progress as soon as possible.

　　促进两伊全面执行598号决议
　　联合国秘书长特使赴两伊访问
    本报联合国10月27日电  记者刘开宸报道：据联合国发言人今天宣布，联合国秘书长特使埃利亚松将于本月30日离纽约前往中东，对巴格达和德黑兰进行穿梭访问，以图突破目前解决两伊冲突问题的僵局。
    在埃利亚松行前，安理会今天下午举行磋商会，审议了关于解决两伊冲突问题的安理会598号决议的执行情况。会后发表的声明指出，两伊实施停火已有14个月，全面执行此决议方面没有取得实质性进展，安理会全体理事国对此深表关切。
    安理会本月主席福蒂埃对记者说，埃利亚松的穿梭访问，是受到两伊政府欢迎的，这是一个“有益的发展”。他希望两伊本着善意的精神，进行建设性的工作，早日取得实质性的进展。
