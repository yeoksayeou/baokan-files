Title: My Perspective on Walls

Walls have, at one point in time, been heavily criticized in newspapers and on screens: China has too many walls. Enclosing walls, city walls, and even the Great Wall that stretches across the northern part of the country, have all been accused of symbolizing closure and conservatism, being the embodiment of those who attack the talented, and representing the concept of drawing boundaries to confine people, as well as being the root of poverty and backwardness!

Some have raised doubts and objections to these criticisms. For example, the ancient city of Chang'an was grand, sturdy, and imposing. However, during the Han and Tang dynasties, it was rightfully the starting point of the Silk Road and the center of friendly exchanges between nations. Throughout history, 11 dynasties have established their capitals there. Dynasties have changed, and prosperity has fluctuated, sometimes open, sometimes closed. Evaluating merits and demerits, it all depends on human actions, what does it have to do with "walls"? In reality, as a military facility from ancient times, the city wall has long lost its original significance. Some representative ancient city walls (including the Great Wall) have been preserved, and once repaired and opened, they attract both domestic and foreign tourists and scholars, earning high praise. This is because the value of these ancient buildings has changed and increased. They serve to commemorate history, demonstrate the sublime spirit of the nation, reflect the outstanding achievements of ancient architecture, and thus inspire the aspirations of future generations. If one were to start from the needs of the present and forcefully blame ancient city walls, criticizing them harshly and calling for their "complete destruction," it would not only be unfair but also hurt national sentiments, making it difficult for people to accept.

I have visited the so-called largest city in the world, the ancient city of Nanjing's Zhonghua Gate. This ancient fortress, which was closed for many years and has since reopened, has become a popular tourist spot, just like the Great Wall. Its majestic appearance and intricate structure showcase the wisdom and strength of the people: four stone-constructed archways form three layers of moats, each moat equipped with iron gates operated by pulleys. Within the 20-meter-high city wall, there are 27 dome-shaped halls for garrisoning troops. The city gate is the throat of the city; in times of peace, it is opened to facilitate internal and external exchanges. In times of danger, it can be closed at a command to repel enemies outside the city or to lure enemies in and capture them. The construction of the ancient fortress utilizes the complementary functions of walls and gates, embodying the dialectical unity of openness and defense.

Fundamentally, a "wall" is just one form of "boundary." Things have differences, and "boundaries" are always necessary. Although history has entered the 1980s, boundaries such as territorial borders, national borders, and various tangible and intangible "boundaries" will continue to exist for a long time. The root cause of closure and isolation lies in the "boundaries"? No. The most crucial thing is how the "gateways" are established and utilized. As for enclosing walls, one might as well appreciate the gardens of Jiangnan. Although this is a technique of architectural art, the enlightenment it provides far exceeds the scope of art. The walls of Suzhou's Canglang Pavilion are an example: the garden designer constructed single or double corridors along the walls, and opened a series of latticed windows (variously shaped openwork windows) along the walls. Walking along the walls, not only do the eaves provide shade and rain protection, but also each window offers a different scenic view. If one's interest in sightseeing is piqued, one can easily pass through a moon gate (a small, elegant garden gate) and enter deeper into the scene. Outside the wall, one can overlook the water and mountains; inside the wall, one can admire the mountains and water. The wall divides the garden's interior and exterior scenery into two parts; the latticed windows then connect the divided scenery into one. Without the long wall's concealment, everything would be in plain sight; without the latticed windows' revelation, it would be closed and stuffy. Openness and closure, concealment and revelation, complement each other, reaching a perfect state.

The Ming Dynasty garden master Ji Cheng once discussed the artistic effect of windows on walls: "Enclosing vast expanses of water, collecting the splendor of all four seasons." This phrase reveals the secret. Seeing the big in the small, the principle is the same.

Building walls is not a unique creation of the Chinese nation, but in a certain sense, Chinese walls also reveal the national character of traditional culture. The discussions about "walls" originally did not intend to focus on "walls." Analyzing the criticisms of "walls" seems to reveal a common way of thinking—one-size-fits-all, one wind blows, or one-sided. For example, to reflect on history, one must generally deny tradition; to open up and introduce, one must belittle one's own strengths; to advocate patriotism, one must be anti-foreign and exclude foreigners, and so on. Avoiding bias and being good at thinking in the midst of opposing extremes is very important. It seems that the appearance of "walls," with their organic combination and mutual benefit with doors and windows, also seems to contain this meaning...

　　墙之我见
　　张成珠
    墙，在报刊和屏幕上有个时期受到了空前的抨击：中国多墙。围墙、城墙，直至横贯北国之墙——万里长城，皆被指责是封闭保守的象征，围攻贤能者的化身，画地为牢的同义语，以及贫困落后的祸根！
    对此评论，也曾有人产生怀疑，提出异议，比如古代的长安城，算得上宏伟、坚固、森严了，但在汉、唐时代，它无愧为丝绸之路的起点，各国友好交往的中心。历史上，先后有11个王朝在那里建都，朝代交替，盛衰不定，时而开放，时而封闭，评功论过，事在人为，与“墙”何干？其实，做为古代军事设施的城墙，早已失去了它原有的意义，一些具有代表性的古城墙（包括长城），之所以能够保留下来，一经修缮开放，便吸引中外游人和学者纷至沓来，赢得高度评价，那是因为这些古建筑的价值更换了，增加了，它在于纪念历史，显示崇高的民族精神，反映古代建筑艺术的卓越成就，从而激励后人的志气。如果仅从现时的某种需要出发，硬把古城墙当成替罪羊，口诛笔伐，来个“彻底砸烂”，不仅有失公允，也会伤害民族情感，难以令人接受。
    我曾参观号称世界第一大城——南京古城的中华门，这座古城堡关闭多年重新开放，也同万里长城一样，立即变成了旅游热点。那雄伟的气势，精巧的构造，显示着人民的智慧和力量：四道石砌拱门构成了三重瓮城，每一瓮城都设有绞关启动的铁门。在高达20余米的城墙中，筑有27个穹形大厅，驻扎卫戍部队。城门，乃城之咽喉，在太平的日子敞开它，便利内外交往；一旦遇有敌情，只待令下，或闭合大门，拒敌于城外，或放敌进入，“瓮”中捉“鳖”。古城堡的构筑，发挥了墙与门的互补作用，体现开放与防备的辩证统一。
    从根本上说，“墙”只是“界”的一种形式。事物有差异，“界”总是不可缺少的。历史虽已跨入20世纪80年代，地界、国界，以及各种有形的无形的“界”，还将长期存在。造成封闭、隔绝的根源在于“界”吗？否。最要紧的，还是在界的如何设立、运用“门户”。就围墙而论，不妨欣赏江南园林，虽然那是一种建筑艺术手法，然而它所给人的启迪，却远远地超过了艺术的范畴。苏州沧浪亭的院墙就是一例：造园艺术家依墙构筑成单廊或复廊，沿墙开成一列漏窗（各具形态的露空花窗），顺墙行走，不仅廊檐具有遮荫避雨之效，而且逐窗观赏，移步换景，窗窗都是一幅风景画儿。倘若诱得游兴勃发，随时可以穿过月洞（小巧的园林之门），深入其境。墙外，临水望山；墙里，依山观水。墙壁把园林内外的山水一分两片；漏窗又将分隔的山水连成一气。没有长墙的遮隐，则一览无余；没有漏窗的透露，就封闭郁闷。开与闭，隐与现，相得益彰，达到了完美的境界。
    明代造园大师计成，曾经论述墙上设窗的艺术效果：“纳千顷之汪洋，收四时之烂漫。”一语道破了其中的奥妙。以小见大，大小同此一理。
    筑墙虽非中华民族的独创，但是中国之墙，在一定意义上也显露着传统文化的民族气质。关于“墙”的评议，本来醉翁之意不在“墙”，分析对“墙”的谴责，似可发现常见的一种思维方式——一刀切、一风吹或一边倒。例如，要反思历史，就得一概地否定传统；要开放引进，就得贬低本国的长处；要提倡爱国，就得反洋排外，等等。避免偏颇，善于在对立的两极之中进行思维是十分重要的。看来，“墙”的现身说法，以其与门窗的有机结合，互补互惠，也似蕴含着这番道理呢……
