It has been ten years since I last returned to my hometown. This spring, I went back to visit my elderly grandmother and was truly surprised by the tremendous changes in my hometown. Ten years ago, the northwestern slope with its pockmarked, salty, and alkaline terrain is now dotted with sparkling fish ponds. Around the ponds, willows sway and poplars reach for the sky. The old man in charge of the ponds is Hu Fangjiang, one of the few remaining old Red Army soldiers in our county. Despite his snow-white beard and eyebrows, this old man is full of vigor, with a ruddy complexion, sharp eyes, and a straight back. He manages all these fish ponds alone and does not ask for any compensation. He walks among the lush trees and ponds, looking like an immortal, and sometimes even sings a few lines of Beijing opera. Besides his two blue-brick, red-tile houses, to stay cool, he has also built a canopy and a small pavilion among the fish ponds. The canopy is surrounded by lush fruits and the chirping of cicadas, making it feel like a paradise. Who would believe that just ten years ago, this place was a barren land where "in spring and winter, it is white and vast; in summer and autumn, it is flooded; you only hear the croaking of frogs, but no grain is harvested"? Back then, not only was it impossible to raise fish, grow trees, or cultivate crops, but even finding a stick for the stove was difficult. At that time, there was a saying: "The wind blows the salt and alkali, covering the sky like silver; grain does not grow on the land, and you have to travel forty-five miles to find a stick for the stove."

Old Mr. Hu, pointing to the picturesque banks of the Liuqing River, laughed and said to me, "This is truly an extraordinary change in ten years!" He happily added, "Water is managed by people, and land is cultivated by people. Policies stimulate enthusiasm."

As the sun sets, the entire slope looks like a painting. A thin layer of mist floats over the Liuqing River. At this moment, a few ducks fly from the river, quacking "quack, quack." These are the ducks being herded by the duck keeper to the grassy banks of the river to rest. Old Mr. Hu said, "In the past, the people here only knew how to farm. Now, people have become clever, knowing how to raise ducks, fish, build ponds, plant lotus roots, and weave baskets."

During dinner, I sat with Old Mr. Hu under the melon trellis. The light bulb hanging from the trellis lit up. At this moment, I looked around and saw that all the lights in the fish pond area were on. Looking up, the crescent moon had silently risen to the middle of the sky, and countless stars had also lit up in the blue sky. The air seemed particularly pure at this moment.

The fish ponds shimmered with ripples, and the fish in the ponds surfaced, some of which, perhaps lured by the light, jumped up and down like acrobats performing a knife-throwing act, as Old Mr. Hu described. I and the old man enjoyed fresh fish, tender chicken, melons, beans, green vegetables, and the famous local "Double Yellow" wine, feeling as if we were in a wonderful fairy tale.

After dinner, Old Mr. Hu said, "You read your books, and I will weave my baskets. This year is the 'big year' for our apple orchard, with many fruits, so we need to weave more baskets." I smiled and said, "Old Mr. Hu, everything I have seen since coming back to my hometown is not something you can find in books. This is also a kind of reading, reading the great book of nature." This made Old Mr. Hu laugh heartily, and even the birds on the branches were startled by the laughter.

    月夜鱼塘边
    胡炜东
    十年不回故乡了。今年春上回故乡看望老祖母，我真没想到家乡会有这么大的变化。十年前那西北坡洼地的坑坑洼洼的盐碱坡，现在已是星罗棋布，粼光闪闪的养鱼塘。塘的四周，白杨钻天，垂柳拂地。看塘的老爷爷是俺县为数不多的老红军胡方江。别看这位老爷爷发须如雪，连眉毛都是白的，可他精神饱满，面色红润，耳不聋，眼不花，腰不弯，背不驼，连牙齿都没脱落。这片片养鱼塘由他一人看管，他却不要报酬。他穿行在那郁郁葱葱的树林鱼塘之间，活像个老寿星，高兴了还唱两句梆子腔。老人除了两间蓝砖红瓦的瓦房之外，为了乘凉，他还在十几个鱼塘之间搭了个天棚和庵子。凉棚四周瓜果累累，蝈蝈高唱，真是如入仙境。谁能相信，这里在十年前还是个“春冬白茫茫，夏秋水汪汪，光听蛤蟆叫，就是不打粮”的穷地方呢。那时别说养鱼、长树、种庄稼，连根烧灶用的火棍也找不来。当时流传着：“风吹盐碱起，漫天白如银；遍地粮不长，四十五里找火棍。”方江老爷爷指着那风景如画的柳青河两岸，笑哈哈地对我说：“这可真是十年变化不寻常啊！”他不无乐趣地说：“水在人管，地在人种，政策调动积极性。”
    夕阳西下，整个大坡宛如一幅图画。柳青河上空，远远望去，飘起一层薄雾。这时从河里飞来几声“吖吖”的鸭鸣，那是放鸭人赶起鸭群到绿草丛生的河两岸宿营。方江老爷爷说：“过去咱这里的人光会种庄稼。现在人们忽然聪明了，什么养鸭、养鱼、造塘种藕、编织等都会了。”
    吃晚饭时，我与老方江爷爷坐在瓜棚下，瓜棚上吊着的电灯泡亮了。这时我向四周望去，啊，整个鱼塘区的灯光全亮了。抬头向上看，上弦月也悄悄地升向中天，那蓝澄澄的天空上无数的星辰也一个个亮了。这时的空气似乎特别纯净。
    一方方鱼塘碧波粼粼，塘里鱼儿浮上水面，有的鱼儿可能是受光的引诱，扑扑愣愣向上跳着，按照老方江爷爷的话说：好像杂技团里撂刀子一样。我与老爷爷吃着鲜鱼、嫩鸡、瓜豆、青菜，喝着当地有名的“双头黄”酒，好像置身于美妙的童话世界里。
    酒足饭饱之后，方江老爷爷说：“你看你的书，我编我的篓。今年是咱苹果园的‘大年’，挂果多，得多编织些荆条篓子。”我笑了笑说：“老爷爷，我来到家乡所看到的一切，是在书本上看不到的。我这也是在读书，读大自然这本大书。”说得老爷爷哈哈地笑，连枝头上的斑鸠也扑扑愣愣的被笑醒了。
