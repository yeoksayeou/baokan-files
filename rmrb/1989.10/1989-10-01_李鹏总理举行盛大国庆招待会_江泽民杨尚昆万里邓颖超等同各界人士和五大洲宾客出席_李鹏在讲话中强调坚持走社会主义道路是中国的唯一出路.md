Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 30th.

Premier Li Peng held a grand reception at the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Party and state leaders, representatives from various circles, and guests from five continents gathered to celebrate this glorious and magnificent national holiday.

In his speech at the reception, Premier Li Peng pointed out that over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people of all ethnic groups have made tremendous changes. Forty years of practice have shown us that only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China. Insisting on the socialist path is the only way forward for China.

When Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Wan Li, Deng Yingchao, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhen, and other leaders arrived at the banquet hall with distinguished guests such as Norodom Sihanouk, the Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, and his wife, and Li Chong-yu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Vice Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the entire hall erupted in prolonged, enthusiastic applause.

Other distinguished guests included Egon Krenz, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Vice Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) Speaker of Pakistan Mairaji Khalid, Miroslav Zavagil, a member of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Chairman of the Trade Unions, Huang Wenxian, a long-time friend of the Chinese people, Ivan V. Arkhipov, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Union Council of Ministers and former First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Union Council of Ministers, Riverai Yoshikazu and his wife, Chairman of the Japan-China Economic Association, Leonel Soto, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, Wolfgang Rauchfuss, a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Vice Premier of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, Alphonse Kadage, Deputy Coordinator of the National Executive Committee of the National Unity and Progress Party of Burundi, Alexander Haig, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Global United Corporation and former U.S. Secretary of State, and Ryohaku Otsuka, Chairman of the Japan-China Association.

Tonight, the banquet hall was brightly lit, with a large national emblem hanging on the stage curtain, flanked by 10 vibrant red flags, and flowers surrounding the stage. The hall was filled with joyful music. The attendees were all smiling, celebrating the festive atmosphere.

The reception began with the military band playing the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.

Premier Li Peng then delivered a speech. He first, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, extended festive greetings and warm regards to all workers, peasants, intellectuals, and patriotic individuals across the country who are fighting on the frontlines of socialist modernization; to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security forces; to compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau, compatriots in Taiwan, and overseas Chinese; to the international friends who care about and support China's modernization drive. He also expressed a warm welcome to the guests from various countries present and to the diplomatic envoys stationed in China, and extended heartfelt thanks to the international friends who care about and support China's modernization drive.

Li Peng said, on October 1, 1949, the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China. Since then, the history of China's several thousand years of exploitation has come to an end, and the history of more than a hundred years of slavery by imperialism and colonialism over the Chinese people has also come to an end. China has entered a new era of historical development. There have been twists and turns and setbacks in our socialist cause, and the Party and the government have made mistakes and had setbacks in their guiding principles. However, looking at it as a whole, in the past 40 years, in China's economy, politics, and social life, what has been dominant is development and progress, especially in the past 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have adhered to the four cardinal principles, adhered to reform and opening up, and achieved remarkable results that have attracted worldwide attention.

Li Peng said, in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the spring and summer of this year, our Party and country have undergone a severe test and achieved a great victory, safeguarding the achievements of 40 years of socialist construction and 10 years of reform and opening up. Since this year, we have also continued to seriously implement the policy of rectification and adjustment and deepening reform, achieving significant results. We must continue to work hard and make joint efforts to ensure that the economic situation continues to improve this year.

He said, firmly implementing the Party's basic line and policies is the fundamental starting point for all our work. The basic line of the Thirteenth Party Congress, which focuses on economic construction, adheres to the four cardinal principles, and adheres to reform and opening up, we will resolutely implement and will not waver. The current enterprise contract responsibility system, factory director responsibility system, coastal development policies, individual economy, and private economy policies, etc., should all maintain stability and continuity and will not be easily changed. We should continue to advocate and encourage the development of export-oriented economy in coastal areas, continuously improve the investment environment, and welcome foreign investors to come to China to establish various foreign-funded enterprises.

Li Peng pointed out that continuing to implement the policy of rectification and adjustment is the key to construction and reform at present. The implementation of rectification and adjustment is not opposed to reform and opening up but is to create more favorable conditions for reform and opening up. The rectification and adjustment will probably take three years or a little longer. All levels of leading cadres should work hard, set an example, and work together with the people of the whole country to tighten our belts for a few years.

Li Peng said, we must strengthen the foundation of agriculture and strive for a good harvest. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and also the weak link of the national economy. The development of agriculture relies on policy, science and technology, and investment. The household contract responsibility system is a major policy related to the stability of China's 800 million farmers, which is in line with the current level of productivity in rural areas and should be continued and improved. In places where conditions are really met, it is possible to develop appropriate scale management and collective economy, develop socialized production service organizations, and promote the development of the rural economy.

He pointed out that maintaining and consolidating a stable social and political environment is an important guarantee for the smooth progress of economic construction. In the primary stage of socialism in our country, class struggle is no longer the main contradiction, but it will exist for a long time within a certain range and sometimes will be very intense. We must remain sober-minded. Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have taken a series of measures to combat corruption and strengthen the construction of clean government, which must be implemented to the end and cannot be half-hearted. China's political system reform must also be combined with economic system reform and gradually promoted, while strengthening democratic construction, strengthening legal construction at the same time.

Li Peng said, we must carry out the education of opposing bourgeois liberalization to the end and not be half-hearted. We must continue to carry out education on the basic national conditions and the basic line for the broad masses of the people, to enhance the broad masses' patriotism, collectivism, self-reliance, and hard work, to enhance the firmness and self-awareness of supporting the socialist system. We reiterate here that the Party's policy towards intellectuals will not change because of this turmoil.

Li Peng said, we must adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy. China will continue to implement an independent and peaceful foreign policy, continue to implement the policy of opening up to the outside world, and accelerate the construction of our country. Our reform and opening up are carried out on the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles, for the development and perfection of the socialist system. We will not allow international hostile forces to take advantage of this opportunity to infiltrate and subvert our socialist system.

Li Peng pointed out that peaceful reunification and "one country, two systems" represent the common aspirations of all the Chinese people, including compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau and compatriots in Taiwan. No matter what happens at home and abroad, we will firmly implement this policy. We will not change the capitalist system in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, but we will not allow anyone to use Hong Kong as a base to subvert the central government and the socialist system on the mainland. We hope that the authorities in Taiwan will consider the overall interests of the Chinese nation, do more practical things to promote the "three links" and other exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, and not do things that lead to tension across the Taiwan Strait and are not conducive to national reunification.

Premier Li Peng's speech was interrupted several times by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

After Premier Li's speech, party and state leaders toasted with the Chinese and foreign guests, had cordial conversations with them, and the reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end.

Also present at the reception were Deng Xiaoping, Deng Yingchao, Yang Shangkun, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Wang Zhen, Jiang Zemin, Li Xiannian, and other comrades, as well as retired senior comrades from the central government.

Foreign guests visiting Beijing, envoys from various countries, and foreign experts working in China were also invited to attend the reception.

Leaders from central party, government, and military organs, leaders from various democratic parties and people's organizations, non-partisan patriots, representatives of compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, overseas Chinese, and foreign Chinese, as well as representatives of national labor models, heroes, and advanced workers, representatives of outstanding grassroots officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and representatives of the National Minorities' National Day Visiting Group also attended the reception.

Party and state leaders and foreign guests enter the banquet hall together.

    李鹏在讲话中强调坚持走社会主义道路是中国的唯一出路
    新华社北京9月30日电　（记者李尚志、陈乃进）国务院总理李鹏今晚在人民大会堂宴会厅举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年。党和国家领导人、各界人士和来自五大洲的宾客欢聚一堂，共同庆祝中国人民的光辉、盛大的节日。
    李鹏总理在招待会上的讲话中指出，40年来，在中国共产党领导下，经过各族人民的共同努力，我国发生了翻天覆地的变化。40年的实践告诉我们，只有社会主义能够救中国，只有社会主义能够发展中国。坚持走社会主义道路，这是中国的唯一出路。
    当江泽民、杨尚昆、李鹏、万里、邓颖超、乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环、王震等同志与民主柬埔寨主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和夫人，朝鲜劳动党中央政治局委员、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国家副主席李钟玉等贵宾一起来到宴会大厅时，全场响起长时间的热烈掌声。
    来到宴会大厅的贵宾还有德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、中央书记、民主德国国务委员会副主席埃贡·克伦茨，巴基斯坦国民议会议长迈拉吉·哈立德，捷共中央主席团委员、工会主席米罗斯拉夫·扎瓦吉尔，中国人民的老朋友黄文欢，苏中友协副主席、苏联前部长会议第一副主席伊·瓦·阿尔希波夫，日中经济协会会长河合良一和夫人，古巴共产党中央书记莱昂内尔·索托，德国统一社会党中央委员、民主德国部长会议副主席沃尔夫岗·劳赫富斯，布隆迪民族统一进步党全国常务书记处副协调员阿尔方斯·卡德盖，美国环球联合公司董事长、前国务卿亚历山大·黑格，日中协会会长向坊隆等。
    今晚，宴会大厅里灯火辉煌，主席台帷幕上挂着巨大的国徽，两旁是10面鲜艳的红旗，主席台周围摆满了鲜花。大厅里回荡着欢快的乐曲声。出席招待会的各界人士笑逐颜开，喜庆洋洋。
    招待会开始，军乐队高奏中华人民共和国国歌。
    接着，李鹏总理发表讲话。他首先代表中共中央和国务院，向战斗在社会主义现代化建设各条战线上的全国各族工人、农民、知识分子和一切爱国人士，向人民解放军、武警部队指战员和人民警察，向港澳同胞、台湾同胞和海外侨胞，致以节日的祝贺和亲切的问候；向在座的各国来宾和驻华使节表示热烈的欢迎；向关心和支持我国现代化建设的国际友人表示衷心的感谢。
  李鹏说，1949年10月1日，伟大领袖毛泽东同志宣告了中华人民共和国成立。从此，结束了我国几千年来剥削制度的历史，结束了100多年来殖民主义、帝国主义奴役中国人民的历史，中国进入了历史发展的新时期。我国的社会主义事业有过曲折和反复，党和政府在指导方针上犯过错误，有过失误。但是总起来看，40年来，在中国经济、政治、社会生活中居主导地位的是发展和进步，尤其是党的十一届三中全会以来的10年，我们坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，成绩卓著，举世瞩目。
    李鹏说，在今年春夏之交制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，我们党和国家经受了一场严峻的考验，取得了伟大的胜利，保卫了四十年来社会主义建设和十年来改革开放的成果。今年以来，我们还继续认真贯彻执行了治理整顿和深化改革的方针，取得了明显的成效。我们要再接再厉，共同努力，使今年的经济形势继续向好的方向发展。
    他说，坚定不移地执行党的基本路线和方针政策，是我们各项工作的根本立足点。党的十三大制定的以经济建设为中心、坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的基本路线，我们将坚决执行，决不动摇。现行的企业承包制，厂长负责制，沿海地区发展政策，个体经济和私营经济政策等，都要保持稳定性和连续性，绝不会轻易地加以改变。要继续提倡和鼓励沿海地区发展外向型经济，不断努力改善投资环境，欢迎外商到中国来兴办各种外资企业。
    李鹏指出，继续贯彻治理整顿的方针，是当前建设和改革的重点。实行治理整顿与改革开放并不对立，而是为改革开放创造更加有利的条件。治理整顿大概需要三年或者更长一点的时间。各级领导干部要艰苦奋斗，以身作则，同全国人民一道过几年紧日子。
    李鹏说，要切实加强农业的基础地位，争取农业有一个较好的收成。农业是国民经济的基础，又是国民经济的薄弱环节。发展农业，一靠政策，二靠科技，三靠投入。联产承包责任制是关系到稳定中国八亿农民的大政策，符合农村现阶段生产力的发展水平，应当继续实行并不断完善。在确实具备条件的地方，可以发展适度规模经营和集体经济，发展社会化生产服务组织，促进农村经济的发展。
    他指出，维护和巩固稳定的社会政治环境，是顺利进行经济建设的重要保证。在我国的社会主义初级阶段，阶级斗争已经不是主要矛盾，但将在一定范围内长期存在，有时还会表现得很激烈，我们务必保持清醒的头脑。最近，党中央、国务院采取了一系列克服腐败加强廉政建设的措施，要一抓到底，决不能半途而废。中国的政治体制改革还要与经济体制改革相结合，逐步推进，在加强民主建设的同时加强法制建设。
    李鹏说，要把反对资产阶级自由化的教育进行到底，绝不半途而废。要向广大人民群众不断地开展基本国情的教育，开展基本路线的教育，以提高广大人民爱国主义、集体主义、自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，提高拥护社会主义制度的坚定性和自觉性。我们在这里再次重申，党的知识分子政策不会因为这次动乱而有所改变。
    李鹏说，要坚持独立自主的和平外交政策。中国将一如既往地执行独立自主的和平外交政策，继续执行对外开放政策，加快我国的建设。我们的改革开放是在坚持四项基本原则前提下的改革开放，是为了社会主义制度的发展和完善。决不容许国际敌对势力乘此机会，对我国社会主义制度进行渗透与颠覆。
    李鹏指出，和平统一和一国两制，代表了包括港澳同胞和台湾同胞在内的全体中国人民的共同心愿，不管国内外发生什么风波，我们都将坚定不移地执行这一方针。我们不会改变港澳地区的资本主义制度，同时也不允许有人利用香港作为颠覆中央政府和大陆社会主义制度的基地。我们希望台湾当局以中华民族利益的大局为重，多做一些有利于促进海峡两岸“三通”和其他交往的实事，不要做那些导致两岸关系紧张、不利于祖国统一的事。
    李鹏总理的讲话不时为全场热烈的掌声打断。
    李总理讲话后，党和国家领导人向中外来宾祝酒，同他们亲切交谈，招待会自始至终洋溢着团结、友好的热烈气氛。
    出席招待会的还有田纪云、李铁映、李锡铭、吴学谦、秦基伟、丁关根、宋任穷、温家宝、王平、王首道、伍修权、刘澜涛、李德生、杨得志、肖克、余秋里、宋时轮、张劲夫、陆定一、陈丕显、陈锡联、胡乔木、段君毅、耿飚、姬鹏飞、黄华、黄镇、康世恩、习仲勋、彭冲、朱学范、阿沛·阿旺晋美、严济慈、荣毅仁、廖汉生、倪志福、陈慕华、费孝通、孙起孟、雷洁琼、王丙乾、宋健、王芳、邹家华、陈希同、陈俊生、任建新、刘复之、王任重、方毅、谷牧、康克清、周培源、王光英、邓兆祥、赵朴初、屈武、马文瑞、王恩茂、钱伟长、胡绳、孙晓村、程思远、卢嘉锡、钱正英、司马义·艾买提、侯镜如、洪学智、刘华清等同志，中央离退休的老同志。
