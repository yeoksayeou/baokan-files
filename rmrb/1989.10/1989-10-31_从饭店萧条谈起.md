Title: Starting with the Decline of Restaurants

Before the National Day, I conducted an interview in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia. Early in the morning, I heard the Ulanqab Radio broadcast: In a meeting in mid-September, the managers of 13 hotels and guesthouses in Chifeng region almost unanimously sighed: After the document to resolutely curb the extravagant dining and drinking was issued, they felt both joy and worry. The joy was: “Now the extravagant dining and drinking has truly been curbed.” The worry was: “But the hotels have also been shut down.”

To understand the situation, I specially went to the largest roast duck restaurant in Chifeng, the North Desert Roast Duck Restaurant, to see for myself.

It was almost noon when I entered the restaurant. Several young women dressed in neat purple-red suits greeted me enthusiastically, saying, “Would you like to have a meal? Please…” I looked around, and the restaurant, which was quite elegantly decorated, was empty. I asked:

“Why are there no customers eating? Is it because it’s noon? Do you have more customers in the evening?”

The young women looked embarrassed: “It has been like this for many days. Last night, there were no customers either. Yesterday noon, only two tables were reserved by private individuals.”

In the past, customers were lined up at the door, and the staff was busy attending to them. At the busiest times, the dining hall was not enough, and even the office was used to accommodate customers. Now, the young manager, with a worried expression, told me: “Since August, the business revenue has dropped sharply. From seven or eight million yuan per month, it has dropped to 2.4 million yuan, and it will drop even more in September. In the past, this place mainly served public and organizational banquets, and individual customers were not taken care of. Now, the waitresses are waiting for customers like they are waiting for relatives!”

I also interviewed an official from the Municipal Commerce Bureau. It turned out that in the small city of Chifeng, excluding stalls, there were as many as 463 restaurants of various sizes. In the past, the extravagant use of public funds for dining and drinking was rampant, and every restaurant was full, and every household was making money. Now, the business revenue of 11 large hotels has dropped by 70% to 80%. The high-end Chifeng Hotel has a bed occupancy rate of only 10%. The reason is that meetings have significantly decreased, and public fund dining has reduced, sometimes earning only 100 to 200 yuan a day. The entire hotel’s 140-plus employees are partly unable to receive their original wages. It is said that not only this hotel is losing money and “can’t open the pot,” but some can only pay 50% to 70% of the wages.

The thriving restaurants are now facing a crisis, which indeed brings difficulties to the restaurant employees. However, the long-standing extravagant dining and drinking has been curbed, which is indeed a good thing.

What is the way out for restaurants? During the rectification and management, the structure of the national economy is being adjusted, and the structure of the commercial service industry naturally needs to be adjusted as well.

In places where abnormal consumption has stimulated the abnormal development of restaurants, it is inevitable that a batch of restaurants will have to be closed, stopped, merged, or transformed. For example, in Xuzhou, a railway hub, in recent years, due to the gathering of speculators, the number of beds has increased from less than 10,000 to more than 20,000. During the rectification and management, illegal operators have been hit hard, and some restaurants will inevitably be deserted and unable to continue. This requires finding another way out. Some need specific analysis. For example, in some places, the number of restaurants is both many and few. The problem of difficulty in eating has not been well solved. There are many high-end restaurants, but few mid-to-low-end ones. Who can afford to spend a thousand yuan on a meal? Ordinary people can’t afford it! Therefore, the structure of high, mid, and low-end restaurants should be rationalized. Even high-end restaurants should lower their standards, add as many breakfast options as possible, and add more popular dishes to strive for small profits and quick turnover, convenience for the public, and get out of the predicament.

In terms of guiding ideology, we should adhere to the principle of the commercial service industry serving production and the public, and oppose the pursuit of profits alone. The socialist commercial service industry, of course, should emphasize economic benefits, but we should not forget to emphasize social benefits and adhere to the unity of economic benefits and social benefits. Looking at the market, the number of commercial service outlets has increased significantly, but the proportion of large and small commodities, catering, and repair services is imbalanced, and this can be seen everywhere. The old problem of difficulty in buying small commodities and repairs has not been truly solved. The key is that one is profitable and the other is not. The direction of operation and the flow of personnel are all towards the more profitable ones. Therefore, the relevant authorities must have a clear mind and tilt the policy to encourage state-owned, collective, and individual operators to develop in the industries that are in short supply, neglected, and urgently needed by the people.

### 从饭店萧条谈起

　　从饭店萧条谈起
　　杨泓
    国庆节前在内蒙古集宁市采访。一大早即听到乌兰察布电台广播：在9月中旬的一次会议上，集宁地区13家饭店、招待所的经理几乎异口同声地感叹道：坚决刹住吃喝风的文件下来后，他们是忧喜参半。喜的是：“这下可真把吃喝风刹住了。”忧的是：“也把饭店给刹死了。”
    为了解实情，我特意到集宁一家最大的烤鸭店——塞北烤鸭店去一窥究竟。
    时近中午，进得店来，几位身着笔挺紫红西服裙的姑娘迎了上来，异常热情地说：“吃饭吗？请……”我一看，布置得比较讲究的餐厅里，空无一人。我问：
  “怎么不见一个客人吃饭，莫非因为是中午吗？晚上客人是否多些？”
    姑娘面露尴尬之色：“好多天都是这样了。昨晚也是没有一个客人。昨天中午只有私人来这里请了两桌。”
    过去这里顾客盈门，应接不暇。最忙时，餐厅不够用，连办公室也腾出来接待顾客。如今，年轻的经理愁容满面地对我说：“从8月份以来，营业额猛降。由每月七八万元降至2.4万元，9月份还要降。过去这儿主要是公家、单位宴请，零客顾不上接待。现在服务员盼顾客，就像盼亲人一样！”
    我又访问了市商业局的一位负责人。原来，小小集宁市，不算摊点，大小饭店竟有463家之多。过去用公款吃喝之风盛行，家家客满，户户赚钱。现在，11家大饭店营业额普遍下降70％—80％。高档的集宁饭店，最近床位利用率只有10％。原因是会议明显减少了，用公款吃喝的少了，有时一天收入只有100—200元。全店140多名职工部分已拿不到原工资。据说，赔钱、“揭不开锅”的远不止这一家，有的只能开50％—70％工资。
    生意兴隆的饭店居然出现危机，固然给饭店职工带来困难，但屡禁不止的吃喝之风刹住了，确实是一件大好事。
    饭店的出路何在呢？在整顿治理中，国民经济的结构在调整，商业服务业的结构自然也要调整。
    凡畸形消费刺激了饭店畸形发展的地方，饭店不可避免地要关、停、并、转一批。如徐州这个铁路枢纽，近几年由于倒爷云集，床位由不到1万张猛增至2万多张。整顿治理中非法经营者受到打击，有些饭店必然是人去楼空，难以为继。这就需要酌情另谋出路。有的则需要具体分析。如有些地方的饭店是又多又不多，吃饭难问题并未很好解决。多的是高档的，少的是中低档的。一掷千金吃顿饭，何许人也？一般群众哪能吃得起！所以要使高、中、低档饭店的结构合理化。即使是高档饭店，也要放下架子，尽可能增设早点，添加大众化的饭菜，力求薄利多销，方便群众，走出困境。
    在指导思想上，要坚持商业服务业服务生产、服务大众的宗旨，反对一味追逐利润。社会主义的商业服务业，当然要讲经济效益，但不要忘记更要讲社会效益，要坚持经济效益与社会效益的统一。综观市场，商业服务业的网点是大大增多了，但经营大商品与小商品，饮食业与修理业，其比例失衡，又随处可见。买小商品难，修理难的老问题并没有得到真正解决。关键是一个利大一个利小，经营方向，人员流动，都往利大的奔了。所以有关主管部门要有清醒的头脑，在政策上要有所倾斜，鼓励国营、集体、个体经营者向缺门的、冷落的而又为人民生活所急需的行业发展。
