Upon seeing the photograph in *People's Daily* of General Secretary Jiang Zemin drinking tea from a large bowl in a peasant's cave dwelling in Yan'an and engaging in cordial conversation with the peasants, my heart swelled with emotion. It reminded me of Chairman Mao's words to some leading cadres studying at the Central Party School: "The cave dwellings in Yan'an are the most revolutionary. The cave dwellings in Yan'an contain Marxism-Leninism. The cave dwellings in Yan'an can direct the nationwide anti-Japanese war. Chiang Kai-shek now lives more luxuriously than we do, with high-rise buildings, villas, and electric lights. What use is luxury? The people of the entire nation do not listen to him. We must not look down on ourselves or on the cave dwellings. Now, the people of the entire nation place their hopes in us, which means they place their hopes in the cave dwellings of Yan'an." Chairman Mao's words make us, who have never lived in the cave dwellings of Yan'an, think of the tumultuous years our predecessors spent in those cave dwellings, and our hearts feel warm.

Comparing the past with the present, today's conditions are certainly much better, but we must not lose the Yan'an spirit. For this reason, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the National Day, General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressed his concern for the people of Yan'an and said during his inspection of Yan'an: "The spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle in Yan'an has not become outdated. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the War of Liberation, we must carry forward the Yan'an spirit; in the primary stage of socialism, we cannot do without the Yan'an spirit. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to build socialism." In the past, relying on this spirit, we removed the "three big mountains" from the heads of the Chinese people. Now, the Chinese people still have two mountains pressing down on them: one is called poverty; the other is called backwardness. Facing these two mountains, we must carry forward the spirit of the Yan'an cave dwellings and, like the "foolish old man," "dig the mountains without stopping," writing a brilliant new chapter.

Forty years have passed since the victory of the revolution. The Yan'an spirit has faded in the minds of some people, and a few have even become corrupt and degenerate, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and being exploited by those who instigated turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots. This lesson is so painful! Now, advocating the Yan'an spirit, various levels of party organizations are implementing the Party Central Committee's measures for clean governance, giving people hope and strengthening their confidence in building socialist modernization.

　　延安窑洞与延安精神
　　吴从龙
    看到《人民日报》刊登江泽民总书记在延安农民家窑洞喝大碗茶并与农民亲切交谈的照片，心情激动不已，使人想起了当年毛主席曾语重心长地对中央党校学习的一些领导干部说：延安的窑洞是最革命的，延安的窑洞里有马列主义，延安的窑洞能够指挥全国的抗日战争。蒋介石现在比我们住得阔气，有高楼，有洋房，有电灯，阔气有什么用呢？全国人民都不听他的。我们不要看不起自己，不要看不起窑洞，现在，全国人民都把希望寄托在我们身上，也就是寄托在延安的窑洞里。毛主席的这番话，使我们今天没有住过延安窑洞的革命后继者，想起先辈在窑洞里度过的峥嵘岁月，心也热乎乎的。
    今昔对比，今天当然优越多了，但延安作风不能丢。正由于这样，江泽民总书记在国庆四十周年前夕，对延安人民的关怀，在延安视察时说：“自力更生，艰苦奋斗的延安精神没有过时。抗日战争、解放战争的艰苦岁月要发扬延安精神；社会主义初级阶段，也离不开延安精神。否则，我们的社会主义是很难建成的。”过去，靠这种精神，搬掉了中国人民头上的“三座大山”。现在中国人民仍有两座大山压着：一座叫贫穷；一座叫落后。面对着这两座大山，更要发扬延安窑洞里的精神，像“愚公”那样“挖山不止”，谱写出灿烂的新篇章。
    革命胜利四十年了，延安精神在一些人的头脑里淡忘了，少数的人甚至腐化堕落了，引起人民群众的不满情绪，甚至于被搞动乱和反革命暴乱的人所利用，这种教训是多么的沉痛！如今，提倡延安精神，各级党组织正在贯彻党中央廉政建设措施，使人们看到了希望，增强了建设社会主义现代化的信心。
