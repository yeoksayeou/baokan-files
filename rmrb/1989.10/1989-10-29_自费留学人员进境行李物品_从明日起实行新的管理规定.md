The General Administration of Customs, the State Education Commission, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a joint notice. Starting from October 30, 1989, new management regulations will be implemented for personal effects of self-funded overseas students.

The notice specifies that self-funded overseas students refer to individuals who are primarily studying or furthering their education at regular universities (colleges) abroad.

The notice stipulates that after enrolling in school, self-funded overseas students should present their passport, official admission notice, and student ID to register with the Chinese embassy or consulate abroad. Those who have already been studying abroad before the issuance of this notice should register with the embassy or consulate within six months of the notice's release. When self-funded overseas students return to China after completing their studies and wish to enjoy the same treatment as government-sponsored students, they should, within three months of graduation, present their passport, diploma (or certificate of completion), and other relevant documents to the original registration embassy or consulate to obtain a "Certificate for Self-Funded Overseas Students." Those with incomplete or inconsistent documents will not be issued the certificate. The embassy or consulate has the right not to issue the certificate for those who do not report to the embassy or consulate.

The notice stipulates that the personal effects of self-funded overseas students entering the country will be handled by customs based on the "Certificate for Self-Funded Overseas Students" issued by the Chinese embassy or consulate abroad, along with the student's passport and diploma (or certificate of completion), following the same procedures as government-sponsored students. If the certificate, documents, or certificates are inconsistent, or if the self-funded overseas student temporarily enters or exits the country during their study period, or if they return to China more than a year after graduation, customs will handle the clearance based on the relevant regulations using the passport they hold.

When customs handles the clearance of personal effects for self-funded overseas students who have completed their studies and returned to China, following the same regulations as government-sponsored students, the principle is to allow clearance based on the study duration (from the date of enrollment to the date of graduation). However, for those who temporarily entered or exited the country during their study period, the time for calculating the personal effects brought into the country should be from the date of the most recent exit to the date of graduation.

    新华社北京10月28日电  海关总署、国家教委、外交部日前联合发出通知，从今年10月30日起，自费出国留学人员携带进境行李物品实行新的管理规定。
    《通知》指出，自费留学人员系指在国外正规大学（学院）注册的学习和进修为主要目的的人员。
    《通知》规定，自费留学人员在入校注册后，应持本人护照、正式入学通知、学生证，向我驻外使领馆登记注册，在本通知下达前已在国外学习的自费留学人员，应在通知下发之日起半年内到使领馆登记注册。自费留学人员学成回国时，本人要求享受公派留学人员待遇的，应于毕业之日起3个月内，持本人护照、毕（结）业证书等有关证件到原注册的我驻外使领馆办理《自费留学人员证明》，凡证件不齐、不符者，不予办理。凡不到驻外使领馆报到者，驻外使领馆有权不为其出具证明。
    《通知》规定，自费留学人员携带进境的行李物品，海关一律凭我驻外使领馆开具的
  《自费留学人员证明》和本人护照以及毕（结）业证书，比照公派留学人员办理验放手续。凡证明与证件、证书不符的，或者自费留学人员在国外学习期间临时进出境的，或者自毕业之日起在外滞留时间超过一年回国的，海关凭他所持护照，另按有关规定办理验放手续。
    海关对学成后回国的自费留学人员比照公派留学人员的管理规定办理携带进境行李物品手续时，原则上按其学习时间（从注册入学之日起至毕业之日止）予以验放。但对于在国外学习期间曾经临时进出境者，其携带入境行李物品计算时间应自最近的出境之日起，至毕业之日止。
