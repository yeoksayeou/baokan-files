Ying Mountain County in Hubei Province has restored the labor system for cadres, emphasizing hard work and self-reliance. In the recent county-wide tea, mulberry, economic forest, and fruit tree engineering battle, over 5,000 cadres and staff from various departments went to their respective poverty alleviation contact points to participate in production labor. Their hard work has won them widespread praise: the fine traditions of the Party have been restored, and cadres have become closer to the people!

After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party, the Ying Mountain County Committee issued the "Decision on the Participation of Departmental Cadres in Voluntary Labor," specifying the number of days county and township cadres should work each year. It also made regulations on establishing labor bases, organizing labor competitions, and strictly evaluating labor performance.
