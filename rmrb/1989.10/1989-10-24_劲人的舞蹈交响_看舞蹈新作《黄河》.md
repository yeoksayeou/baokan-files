Title: A Powerful Dance Symphony – Viewing the New Dance Work "Yellow River"

Edition: 6

A dance that is as simple as it can be has sparked an unusual response in the dance world. Audience members of the Second Chinese Art Festival were moved, clapping and shouting enthusiastically. Even foreigners were infected, and compatriots from Taiwan were moved to tears. This dance, known as the symphonic dance "Yellow River," was the closing act of the Beijing Dance Academy's Chinese Dance Special Performance at this year's art festival.

The theme is quite old, and there have been several such dances in recent years. Moreover, the two young directors, Zhang Yujun and Yao Yong, had their premiere in Hong Kong at the end of last year, which was a great success. This time, after revisions, it has made significant progress.

It seems that the authors have discovered the essence of dance in this work, and it is in this aspect that it returns dance to its original form. It has no plot, and the characters are all faded. The plot progresses freely and in an orderly manner with the rhythm and harmony of the music, and the characters are not subordinate to the peasant-style clothing. They are a group of symbolic figures—the people. In this dance without a specific plot, what the audience sees is wave after wave of historical tides, the tenacious struggle and self-reliance of this yellow race, and their struggle for dawn amidst sorrow and joy. The entire performance maximizes the primary element of dance art—the human body. In over 20 minutes, the dynamics of the human body are fully displayed. Struggling with nature, fighting against famine, battling in war, rejoicing, wandering, and helping each other... All of this is completed by the human body and changes in light and color. The dance is filled with an epic sense of tragedy, grand in scale, and magnificent in scene. The essence of dance is fully displayed. It tells us that the more dance expresses itself, the broader its content; conversely, its rational capacity shrinks relatively.

The symphonic nature of the dance first comes from symphonic music. When the authors chose the familiar piano concerto "Yellow River," they did not destroy the integrity of the original music. The dance completely follows the music and strives to embody the internal power of the music. This is the authors' deliberate effort to overcome the recent trend in the dance world of chopping up ready-made music into fragmented pieces when choreographing. Their wish has been realized. The harmony and unity of dance and music, as well as their seamless integration, have strengthened each other, which is an important reason why this dance has been successful and is called a symphonic dance. When people visually receive the dance, their auditory senses simultaneously receive perfect music, and the reasonable and fitting dance images deepen people's understanding of the music. The two complement each other.

The symphonic creation method of dance was formed at the beginning of this century and was introduced to China only a few years ago. Unfortunately, due to the influence of our country's dramatic traditions and the brilliant achievements of narrative ballet, we cannot gain a more widespread understanding of this method. Many people still do not know what role this method will play in our country's dance creation, so there are not many people who have made comprehensive attempts. In this context, the success of "Yellow River" is even more noteworthy.

Due to "Yellow River's" pursuit of symphonic qualities, it has also made progress in the exploration of dance forms. From the directors, designers to the performers, all have deliberately avoided following the crowd to strengthen the dance and express the music, finally breaking away from the "Baroque" trend of one-sidedly pursuing formal elegance and artificial delicacy that has appeared in the dance world in recent years. The entire dance is simple and unadorned, emphasizing the integrity, rhythm, and fluidity of language. In terms of stage design, it deliberately avoids using large-scale and expensive stage sets and decorations. All of this makes the dance stand out with its unique characteristics, realizing its overall concept.

"Yellow River" is a representative of the dance academy's program. What does this signify? The Beijing Dance Academy, known for cultivating outstanding performers, has also made commendable contributions in the cultivation of directors in recent years. Almost all the names listed in the program are those who have recently entered the ranks of directors, a new generation full of vitality.

　　劲人的舞蹈交响
　　——看舞蹈新作《黄河》
　　俏士
    一个朴实得不能再朴实的舞蹈，竟引起舞坛少有的反响。参加第二届中国艺术节的观众激动了，他们不断地鼓掌，呼喊，连外国人也受到感染，台湾同胞为之落泪。这个被称为交响性的舞蹈《黄河》，是本届艺术节北京舞蹈学院中国舞专场的压轴节目。
    论题材，够老了，仅是这类舞蹈，近几年就有几个。而且是两位年轻的编导，一位是张羽军，一位是姚勇。但去年底在香港首演就曾大获成功，这次修改又有不小的进步。
    看来，作者在这部作品里发现的是舞蹈的自我，正是在这一点上它使舞蹈回归了本原。它没有情节，人物都淡化了。情节是随着音乐的旋律与和声织体自由而有规则地行进，人物并不从属于那身农民式裤褂，他们是一组象征式的群体——人民。就在这没有确切情节的舞蹈中，人们视觉所展开的是一浪又一浪的历史波涛，是这个黄色民族的顽强奋进与自强不息，是他们在充满悲哀与欢乐中，用斗争迎来了黎明的曙光。整个节目最大限度地突出了舞蹈艺术最主要的因素——人体。在20多分钟里，人体动态得到了淋漓尽致的发挥。与大自然的争搏，与饥荒的苦斗，战火中的厮杀，人欢马叫，流离失所，团结相助……这一切仅是由人体与光色变化完成的。舞蹈充满了史诗般的悲壮格调，气势恢宏，场面雄伟。舞蹈的本体意识得到充分展现。它告诉我们，舞蹈自身发挥得越强尽，内涵就越宽广；反之，其理性的涵量则相对萎缩。
    舞蹈的交响化，首先来自交响性音乐。作者在选择人们稔熟的钢琴协奏曲《黄河》时，不破坏原音乐的完整性，舞蹈完全服从音乐，并力求使音乐的内在力量形体化。这是作者有意克服近年舞界在用现成音乐编舞时把音乐剪接得支离破碎所做出的努力。他们的愿望实现了，舞蹈与音乐的和谐统一与浑然结合，都使对方得到了强化，这是这个舞蹈获得成功，并被称为交响性舞蹈的一个重要原因。人们在视觉接受舞蹈时，听觉同时接受的是完美的音乐，合理贴切的舞蹈形象，加深了人们对音乐的更深理解。二者相辅相成。
    舞蹈的交响化创作方法，是本世纪初形成的，传到我国也只是近几年的事。可惜的是，由于我国戏剧传统的影响和情节芭蕾的光辉成就，使我们不能更快地得到普遍的认识，很多人尚不知这种方法将会对我国舞蹈创作发生什么作用，因此做全面尝试的人还不多。在这种情况下，《黄河》的成功更应引起注目。
    由于《黄河》对交响性质的追求，使它在舞蹈形式上的探索也取得进展。从编导、设计到演员正是因为要强化舞蹈，表现音乐，都有意不去随俗落套，终于摆脱了近年来舞界出现的片面追求形式华丽和造作娇腻的“巴洛克”之风。全舞质朴无华，强调语言的整体性、韵律性与流动感，舞美上有意不用耗资巨大的布景装饰。这些都使这个舞蹈显现出与众不同的特色，实现了它的总体构想。
      《黄河》是舞蹈学院这台节目的一个代表。这预示着什么呢？素以培养优秀演员著称的北京舞蹈学院，近年在编导的培养上也做出可喜的贡献。节目单中列出的几乎全是近年闯入编导行列的，这是一代充满生气的新人。
