Our reporter, Gu Yaoming, reports from Stockholm, October 12th:

The Swedish Court of Appeal today unanimously ruled to immediately release Christer Pettersson, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the assassination of former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. In July, the Stockholm District Court had convicted Pettersson of murdering Palme and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Pettersson appealed the verdict. The Court of Appeal heard the case last month, with original witnesses testifying again. Palme's widow, Lisbet Palme, stated that she was 100% certain that Pettersson was the person who had been staring at her from a few steps away after Palme was shot and she herself was injured. Apart from this, the prosecutor failed to provide any new evidence. The court ruled that since the murder weapon has not been found and no one has testified to seeing Pettersson with a gun or firing it, the testimonies of Palme's wife and others were insufficient to prove Pettersson's guilt. Therefore, the court unanimously decided to release Pettersson immediately. Pettersson's defense lawyer stated that he would seek compensation for the 301 days Pettersson was detained, amounting to several hundred thousand kronor.

    涉嫌刺杀帕尔梅的彼得松获释
    本报斯德哥尔摩10月12日电　记者顾耀铭报道：瑞典上诉法院今天上午一致判决，立即释放以刺杀瑞典前首相帕尔梅的罪名被判终身监禁的彼得松。
    今年7月，斯德哥尔摩地方法院曾宣判彼得松为刺杀帕尔梅的凶手，判处他终身监禁。彼得松不服，提出上诉。上诉法院于上月开庭受理这一案子，原有证人再次出庭。帕尔梅遗孀丽丝帕特·帕尔梅表示，她百分之百地断定彼得松就是在帕尔梅被枪杀、她本人受枪伤后离她只有几步远盯着她看的人。除此之外，检察官未能提供更多新的证据。法院认为鉴于迄今未找到凶器，无人能作证看到彼得松开枪或持枪，帕尔梅夫人和其他人的证词还不足以判断彼得松就是凶手，因此一致决定立即释放彼得松。彼得松的辩护律师表示将对彼得松被押301天而要求几十万克朗的赔偿费。
