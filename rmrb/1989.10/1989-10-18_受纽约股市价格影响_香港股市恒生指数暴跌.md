		Influenced by the sharp decline in New York stock prices last Friday, the Hong Kong stock market's Hang Seng Index also experienced a significant drop today. By the closing bell this afternoon, the Hang Seng Index stood at 2601 points, down 180 points, marking the highest drop since June 5 this year.

		The Hong Kong stock market opened this morning and within just 10 minutes, it had dropped by over 100 points, reaching a low of 186 points. However, due to investors taking advantage of the low prices to enter the market, trading activity picked up, with the total trading volume for the day reaching 2.2 billion Hong Kong dollars.

		Local stock market analysts believe that today's sharp decline in Hong Kong stocks was primarily due to the influence of external stock markets, rather than other economic or political factors. Therefore, there was no panic selling observed.

    受纽约股市价格影响
    香港股市恒生指数暴跌
    新华社香港10月16日电（记者史晓帆）受上周五纽约股票市场价格暴跌的影响，今天香港股票市场恒生指数也大幅度下跌。下午收市时恒生指数报2601点，下跌180点，创今年6月5日以来的最高跌幅。
    香港股市今晨开市不足10分钟就下跌100多点，最低潮时曾下跌186点。但由于有投资者趁低价入市，所以市场交投转旺，全天交易额为22亿港元。
    此间股市分析家认为，今天港股急挫，主要是受外围股市的影响，而非其它经济政治因素所致，因而并未出现恐慌性抛售。
