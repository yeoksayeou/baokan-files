	Li Ruihuan emphasized today that strengthening ideological and political work is an important aspect and fundamental measure of criticizing bourgeois liberalization and adhering to the four cardinal principles. It is a traditional strength of our party and can also be said to be the most fundamental characteristic distinguishing the socialist system from any other social system. We must firmly uphold and carry it forward.

	This was stated by Li Ruihuan during a meeting with representatives attending the national political work conference of the geological and mining department in Zhongnanhai. Also present at the meeting were Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, and Zhou Jiaxuan.

	Li Ruihuan first expressed his high respect for all the workers on the geological and mining front. He told the ideological and political workers on the geological and mining front that whether or not to strengthen ideological and political work is a major issue that we have long debated with Zhao Ziyang. We believe that in a country like ours, without ideological and political work, relying solely on material interests, we cannot achieve our ultimate strategic goals. Carrying out ideological and political work certainly involves how to do it and the issue of methods suitable for various situations. But this can only be gradually improved and explored in the process of steadfastly conducting ideological and political work.

	Li Ruihuan expressed his belief that the geological and mining front is a hardy force, and that the ideological and political work on the geological and mining front has a glorious tradition. He hoped that more good experiences would be created in this regard in the future, so that the spirit of the "three glories" (glory in devoting oneself to the geological cause, glory in hard work, and glory in finding mines) with the characteristics of the geological and mining front work would be further developed in the new era.

	The national political work conference of the geological and mining department was held in Beijing on October 17 and lasted for five days, concluding today in Beijing. Attending this conference were the party committee or party group secretaries and political department directors of various local geological and mining bureaus. Leaders from the geological and mining departments and other relevant departments attended today's meeting.

　　李瑞环会见地矿部政工会议代表时强调
　　思想政治工作要坚持发扬
    新华社北京10月21日电  （记者徐耀中）中共中央政治局常委李瑞环今天强调，加强思想政治工作是批判资产阶级自由化、坚持四项基本原则的一个重要内容和基本措施，是我们党的一个传统优势，也可以说是社会主义制度区别于其他任何社会制度的一个最基本的特征，我们一定要坚持和发扬下去。
    这是李瑞环同志在中南海会见出席全国地矿部门政治工作会议代表时讲的。和李瑞环同志一同参加会见的领导同志有丁关根、温家宝、邹家华等。
    李瑞环在会见时首先对地矿战线的全体职工表示了崇高的敬意。他对地矿战线的思想政治工作者们说，要不要加强思想政治工作，这是我们与赵紫阳同志长期争论的一个重要问题，我们认为，在我们这样一个国家里，离开思想政治工作，单靠物质利益，不能达到我们的最终战略目标。开展思想政治工作当然有个怎么做的问题，有个适用于各方面情况的思想政治工作的方式方法问题，但这只有在坚定不移地进行思想政治工作的过程中，才有可能逐步地改进和摸索出来。
    李瑞环表示相信，地矿战线是一支过得硬的队伍，地矿战线的思想政治工作有着光荣传统，希望今后在这方面创造出更多的好经验来，使具有地矿战线工作特点的“三光荣”（以献身地质事业为荣、以艰苦奋斗为荣、以找矿立功为荣）的精神，在新的时期得到更大的发展。
    全国地矿部门政治工作会议是10月17日在北京召开的，历时5天，今天在北京宣布结束。出席这次会议的是各地地矿厅局党组或党委书记、政治部主任。地矿和其他有关部门的负责人出席了今天的会见。
