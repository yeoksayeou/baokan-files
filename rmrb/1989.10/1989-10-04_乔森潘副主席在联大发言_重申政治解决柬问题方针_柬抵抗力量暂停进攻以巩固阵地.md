Democratic Kampuchea's Vice Chairman in charge of foreign affairs, Jo Sen Pan, spoke at the UN General Assembly today as a representative of the Democratic Kampuchea side, reaffirming the firm stance of the Democratic Kampuchea side in seeking a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue.

Jo Sen Pan said that the Democratic Kampuchea side fully endorses the views of Prince Sihanouk and the other two factions within the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, believing that advocating for the establishment of a four-party interim government is not for "sharing power," but the only way to achieve a balance of power among the four Cambodian factions. This will help the Cambodian people, under the supervision of the United Nations, to eliminate any external interference and pressure, and freely exercise their right to self-determination.

Jo Sen Pan condemned Vietnam for refusing to withdraw its troops completely and unconditionally under UN supervision and for refusing to establish a four-party interim government. He emphasized that these are two key factors in politically resolving the Cambodian issue.

Jo Sen Pan reiterated the Democratic Kampuchea side's strategic policy for resolving the Cambodian issue, which includes: demanding that the United Nations send a control body to Cambodia to supervise the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops with the support of the UN peacekeeping forces; after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, all factions in Cambodia should disarm or reduce their respective armed forces to 10,000; solemnly declare respect for the election results; and demand that the international community and the United Nations guarantee Cambodia's independence, lasting neutrality, and territorial integrity, among other things.

	According to news received today from Bangkok, the Cambodian resistance forces, which have been launching fierce attacks on Vietnamese forces in the western part of Cambodia, have temporarily suspended their offensive to consolidate the regained positions.

	Due to the intensified military operations by the three armed factions led by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea in the areas of Banteay Meanchey and Poipet in Battambang Province, several counties and enemy positions have been captured recently.

	One resistance fighter said, "The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea has occupied all strategic locations near Banteay Meanchey."

	However, the Bangkok Post yesterday quoted Thai border troops as saying, "The resistance forces have stopped their attacks to replenish ammunition, supply food, consolidate frontline positions, and reorganize their troops."

	According to a senior Thai military official, the resistance forces are active in provinces such as Siem Reap and Banteay Meanchey. They have surrounded the Phnom Penh forces in the Siem Reap and Banteay Meanchey areas and adopted flexible guerrilla tactics.

    重申政治解决柬问题方针
    柬抵抗力量暂停进攻以巩固阵地
    据新华社联合国10月2日电　民主柬埔寨负责外交事务的副主席乔森潘今天以民柬方面代表的身份在联大会议上发言，重申了民柬方面要求全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的坚定立场。
    乔森潘说，民柬方面完全赞同西哈努克亲王和民柬联合政府中另外两方的观点，认为主张建立四方临时政府完全不是为了“分享权力”，而是在柬埔寨四方之间实现力量平衡的唯一途径，这将有助于柬埔寨人民在联合国的监督下，排除任何外来干涉和压力，自由行使其自决权。
    乔森潘谴责越南拒绝在联合国监督下全部和无保留地撤军以及成立四方临时政府，他强调，这是政治解决柬埔寨问题的两个关键因素。
    乔森潘重申了民柬方面关于解决柬埔寨问题的战略方针，其主要内容包括：要求联合国向柬埔寨派遣一个控制机构，在联合国维护和平部队支持下，监督越南全面撤军；在越南撤军之后，柬埔寨所有各派解除武装或将各自的武装力量减至1万人；庄严宣布尊重选举结果；要求国际社会和联合国对柬埔寨的独立、持久中立和领土完整提供保障，等等。
    新华社曼谷10月3日电　据此间今天得到的消息说，在柬埔寨西部向越南金边部队阵地发动猛烈进攻的柬埔寨抵抗力量暂时停止进攻，以巩固收复的阵地。
    由于民柬联合政府领导的3方武装力量加强了在马德望省拜林和诗梳风地区的军事行动，近来夺取了几个县城和敌人的阵地。
    一位抵抗力量人士说，“民柬国民军占据了拜林附近所有的战略要地。”
    但是，《曼谷邮报》昨天引用泰国边境部队消息说，“抵抗力量已停止进攻以补充弹药，供应食品，巩固前线阵地和重整部队。”
    据泰国高级军官透露，抵抗力量正在暹粒和马德望等省活动，他们包围了暹粒和拜林地区的金边部队，采取了灵活的游击战术。
