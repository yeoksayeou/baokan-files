Thousands of spectators last night at the Sichuan Provincial Gymnasium applauded the successful conclusion of the three-day "Autumn of Chinese Dance in Sichuan." More than 500 artists from all over the country participated in this grand event.

This "Autumn of Chinese Dance in Sichuan" is a review of the achievements of China's ethnic and folk dance arts in recent years. Fourteen performance troupes from 10 provinces and municipalities presented programs with distinct local characteristics, fully showcasing the charm of ethnic cultures. Among them, the exquisite skills of Beijing's dragon lantern dance, the robust and solemn performance of Lanzhou's Taiping Drum, and the vigorous Yangge dance with drum beats all left a deep impression on the audience. The folk dance performances by ethnic minorities such as the Miao, Yi, Qiang, and Zhuang presented a colorful spectacle.

On October 1, the artists participating in the Chinese dance performance took to the streets for a costume performance, and people flocked to the streets to catch a glimpse of the spectacle.

This grand event was jointly organized by the Chinese Dancers Association, the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, and the Chengdu Municipal People's Government, with the aim of promoting Chinese dance culture and boosting national spirit.
