This year, Qin Huangdao City implemented openness in 150 large and medium-sized enterprises, ensuring that major issues are known to the workers and that major decisions are made with worker participation. This has strengthened democratic management and enhanced the workers' sense of ownership.

To decide whether to implement openness, the Qin Huangdao City Committee conducted a survey of 10,000 workers. The results showed that the majority of workers in the enterprises strongly demanded openness in factory affairs. They pointed out sharply that the secrecy in enterprise management is a breeding ground for corruption, and that decisions made by a few based on experience alone are the root cause of decision-making errors. Therefore, the City Committee, based on the workers' demands and relevant regulations of the Enterprise Law, formulated and issued opinions on the implementation of openness in enterprises, providing specific regulations on the guiding ideology, content, and forms of openness, as well as the principles to be followed.

Some party and government officials in certain enterprises had "three fears" about openness: first, fearing that openness would "tie their own hands"; second, fearing that "the first stick out will rot first," meaning they would invite trouble; and third, fearing that expanding democracy would lead to a loss of power, making their words less effective. In response to these concerns, the City Committee introduced the experiences of six pilot units, including Liujiang Coal Mine and the City Cotton Mill, explaining that openness in factory affairs is not about tying the leaders' hands but about increasing their wisdom and preventing the abuse of power. It will not disrupt the normal order of the enterprise but will promote more scientific management. It will not undermine but will strengthen the position of the factory director. Subsequently, the City Committee required each enterprise to take issues such as recruitment, housing allocation, bonus distribution, and the conversion of agricultural to non-agricultural household registration, which are closely related to the vital interests of the workers and have the strongest reflections, as breakthroughs. Gradually, the scope and content of openness were expanded. All major decisions related to the long-term development plans of the enterprise, business policies, new product development and technological transformation, major reform measures within the enterprise, management regulations, organizational adjustments, and the selection of cadres, as well as the personal income and housing of enterprise party and government leaders, were made public.

Although Qin Huangdao City has been promoting enterprise openness for a short time, the results have been gratifying.

Firstly, it has promoted and strengthened the anti-corruption efforts in enterprises. Enterprises have increased their transparency in operations, making it difficult for those who abuse power to engage in illegal activities under public supervision. Some improper practices have been corrected, and some corrupt behaviors have been curbed. In Liujiang Coal Mine, the majority of workers' families are in rural areas, and solving the problem of children converting from agricultural to non-agricultural household registration can only be done through recruitment. Therefore, every time recruitment occurs, there is intense competition, affecting the relationship between cadres and workers and production development. Recently, the mine recruited 150 contract workers with grain relationships, and due to the implementation of the open method, no one argued or petitioned, achieving a first-time satisfaction for the competent department, cadres, and workers.

The major decisions of the enterprise have become more democratic, standardized, and scientific, avoiding possible errors. The City Paper Mill, Glass Fiber Factory, Vehicle Factory, and First Construction Company have made public the long-term development plans of the enterprise, annual production and operation plans, factory director's term target responsibility system, contract operation schemes, and other major decision contents, decision bases, internal and external conditions, decision processes, and widely solicited opinions, absorbed reasonable suggestions, and finally, after being confirmed by the workers' congress, formed resolutions. The City Paper Mill made public the labor optimization combination plan, and many workers proposed that the plan should treat laziness but not age, treat slackness but not illness, and treat men and women equally. After modifying the plan, more than 140 surplus personnel were properly arranged, each finding their place.

The enterprise's internal reform has been deepened, and the enterprise's vitality has been enhanced. The Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory made public the medical reform plan, and the majority of workers expressed different opinions. The factory leadership promptly made modifications, and the modified plan both treated those who feigned illness and wasted medicine and ensured that those who were truly ill received treatment, continuing to demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system.

Enterprise openness has enhanced the workers' sense of ownership, and the majority of workers are more concerned about the development of the enterprise. The City Refractory Materials Factory faced difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, resulting in a severe shortage of production funds and the risk of reduced profits. Openness made the workers share the enterprise's difficulties, and the workers actively raised more than 200 million yuan to support the production needs, helping the factory to overcome the difficulties and achieve economic benefits growth ranking first in the province's industry.

### 厂务公开　职工参与  秦皇岛市推行企业公开化建设

　　厂务公开　职工参与
　　秦皇岛市推行企业公开化建设
　　顾日涛　柴树茂
    今年，秦皇岛市在150个大中型企业中实行公开化建设，重大事情让职工知道，重大决策让职工参与，加强了民主管理，增强了职工主人翁责任感。
    要不要进行公开化建设，秦皇岛市委在职工中进行了一次万人问卷调查。调查结果表明，企业广大职工对实行厂务活动公开的要求十分强烈。他们尖锐地指出，企业管理工作神秘化，是腐败现象的防空洞；少数人只凭经验决策，是造成决策失误的根源。于是，市委根据职工的要求和《企业法》有关规定，制定和印发了企业推行公开化建设的意见，对公开化建设的指导思想、公开的内容与形式、应遵循的原则等问题作出了具体规定。
    一些企业的党政干部对公开化建设有“三怕”思想：一怕公开后“做茧自缚”，自我捆住手脚；二怕“出头的椽子先烂”，自找麻烦；三怕扩大了民主，自己“大权旁落”，以后说话不灵。针对这些思想顾虑，市委组织介绍了柳江煤矿、市棉纺厂等6个试点单位的经验，说明厂务公开，不是捆住领导手脚，而是增加领导的智慧，防止权力滥用；不仅不会搞乱企业正常秩序，而且会促进企业管理更加科学化；不是动摇而是巩固了厂长的中心地位。接着，市委要求各企业以招工就业、住房分配、奖金发放、户口“农转非”、领导者个人收入等与群众切身利益关系最密切、反映最强烈的热点问题作为突破口，逐步拓宽公开的内容和范围。凡是有关企业长远发展规划、经营方针、新产品开发和技术改造、企业内部重大改革措施、管理规章制度、机构调整和干部选拔等重要决策以及企业党政领导个人收入、住房等情况都实行公开。
    秦皇岛市推行企业公开化建设时间虽然不长，却收到可喜的效果。
    首先，促进和加强了企业的廉政建设。企业提高了办事透明度，使弄权营私者不敢在大庭广众的监督下违法乱纪，一些不正之风得到纠正，一些不廉洁行为有所收敛。柳江煤矿绝大多数职工家属都在农村，解决子女农转非只有走招工的路子。因此，每次招工时你争我抢，互不相让，影响干群关系和生产发展。前不久，该矿招收150名带户粮关系的合同制工人，由于实行了公开的办法，无一人争吵和上访，第一次做到了主管部门、干部、职工三满意。
    企业重大决策进一步民主化、规范化、科学化，避免了可能出现的失误。市造纸厂、玻璃纤维厂、车辆厂、一建公司等企业，把企业发展长远规划、年度生产经营计划、厂长任期目标责任制、承包经营方案，诸如此类的重大决策内容、决策依据、决策内外条件、决策过程，都向群众公开，广泛征求意见，吸收合理建议，最后经职代会通过确认，形成决议。市造纸厂把劳动优化组合方案公开，许多职工提出了应当治懒不治老，治滑不治病，男女平等的意见，经过修改方案，使140多名编余人员得到妥善安置，各得其所。
    深化了企业内部改革，增强了企业活力。山海关桥梁厂把医疗改革方案公开之后，多数职工提出不同意见，厂领导及时作了修改，修改后的方案既治了泡病号的、浪费药的，又使真有病的人保证得到治疗，继续体现出社会主义制度的优越性。
    企业公开化建设，增强了职工主人翁责任感，广大职工更加关心企业发展。市耐火材料厂货款收不回来，生产资金严重短缺，面临减利危险。公开化使职工与企业患难与共，职工主动集资200多万元，支援生产急需，使厂子一举渡过难关，经济效益增长幅度位居全省同行业之首。
