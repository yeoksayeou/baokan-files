Last year, a Taiwanese compatriot returned to the mainland to visit relatives. He originally thought he would still have to ride a donkey for seven days from Taiyuan to his hometown in Liu Lin County, Da Zhuang Village in the Lvliang Mountains, as in the old days. To his surprise, he arrived home after just 5 hours by car. He was astonished and excited to see that even such a remote mountain village had road access, exclaiming, "The Communist Party has truly done good things for the people!"

Shanxi Province is located in the Loess Plateau, with the Taihang Mountains to the east and the Lvliang Mountains to the west. The province is 88% mountainous, with high and steep roads, making travel difficult. Before liberation, the entire province had only 50 kilometers of railway that could barely accommodate vehicles, and only 1,300 kilometers of dirt roads. There were only four transportation outlets to neighboring provinces. Now, railways and highways crisscross and connect the province. A total of 2,600 kilometers of railways, including the Tongpu, Jingyuan, Daqin, Xihou, Taijiao, Hanchang, and Shitai lines, along with 12 branch lines, traverse more than 50 counties and cities in Shanxi. The province's total highway mileage has reached 29,875 kilometers, achieving highway access to every county and township, with 94% of villages accessible by car. The highway density is 19.1 kilometers per square kilometer, which is 8.9 kilometers more than the national average. Every day, tens of thousands of vehicles and hundreds of trains travel across Shanxi, transporting billions of tons of coal and other materials out of the province annually. Since the founding of the People's Republic, the state has paid great attention to the construction of roads in Shanxi, investing nearly 6 billion yuan in road construction over 40 years.

    太行吕梁千线穿  七沟八梁变通途
    三晋行路不再难
    据新华社太原电（记者张怀京、廖由滨、惠金义）去年，一位台胞回大陆探亲，原以为还要像从前那样从太原骑七天毛驴才能回到家乡吕梁山中的柳林县大庄村。没料到坐5个小时的车就到了家。这么偏僻的山村都通了汽车，他异常惊讶和激动地说：“共产党真给人民办了好事！”
    山西地处黄土高原，东有太行，西有吕梁，境内山区占88％，山高路陡，道路崎岖，群众祖辈受着“行路难”的折磨。解放前夕，全省勉强可以通车的铁路里程只有50公里，土质公路也只有1300多公里，通往邻省的交通出口只有四个。现在，这里铁路、公路互相交错、四通八达。总长2600多公里的同蒲、京原、大秦、西侯、太焦、邯长、石太等7条铁路线连同12条支线，贯通三晋大地50多个县、市；全省公路通车里程已达29875公里，实现了县县乡乡通公路，94％的村通了汽车。公路密度每平方公里达到19.1公里，比全国平均水平还多8.9公里。每天有几十万辆汽车、几百趟列车在山西大地上奔驰，每年运送出境的煤炭等物资几亿吨。建国以来，国家十分重视山西的道路建设，40年共投资近60亿元，用于道路建设。
