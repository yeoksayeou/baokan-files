    全国少工委发出通知
    广泛开展学赖宁学十佳活动
    新华社北京10月13日电  中国少年先锋队全国工作委员会今天向全国少先队组织发出通知，要求各地广泛开展学赖宁、学“十佳”，争做优秀少先队员的活动。
    通知说，全国十佳少先队员是新时期少先队员中的优秀代表。他们不但德智体全面发展，而且每个人在某一个方面又都取得了比较突出的成绩。把他们的思想行为综合起来，就构成了一个较为全面的少先队组织的群体形象，从而反映出少先队组织对全体少先队员的整体要求和希望。
    全国少工委号召全国少先队员向十佳少先队员学习。培养热爱祖国、热爱中国共产党、热爱人民的革命情操；从小立志，树立全心全意为人民服务的革命理想；学习脚踏实地，从点滴小事做起，从自己身边做起的求实精神；学习关心集体、关心他人、助人为乐、尊敬师长的美德，学习勤奋好学、自强自立、机智勇敢、刻苦顽强的优秀品质。
    通知要求全国各级少先队组织，紧密结合本地实际，采取多种形式，深入广泛地开展“学赖宁、学‘十佳’，争做优秀少先队员”的活动。引导广大少先队员，学英雄、学先进，人人争做本学校、本地区的“优秀少先队员”。
