To have both "golden waves" rolling and "silver waves" surging: Hebei to promote intercropping of grain and cotton

    BEIJING, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- How to fundamentally solve the problem of land competition between cotton and grain and achieve simultaneous increases in both? Hebei Province Governor Yue Qifeng recently proposed a new approach of relying on science and technology to promote the intercropping of cotton and grain or the "one wheat, one cotton" system.

    Hebei is one of the major grain and cotton producing provinces in China. The competition for land between cotton and grain remains prominent. To fundamentally solve this problem, Yue Qifeng led agricultural experts and relevant department heads from the provincial government to conduct multiple field investigations in some counties. Through discussions with farmers and rural cadres, Yue Qifeng realized that improving cotton production efficiency cannot rely solely on the state raising purchase prices. It is necessary to rely on technological investment to increase production and quality, and to reform the planting system to expand the multiple cropping index and land use efficiency.

    In the counties of Weixian, Qiuxian, Feixiang, and Cheng'an in the southern Hebei Plain, the "one wheat, one cotton" system has been practiced for several years and has formed a certain scale. This year, these four counties planted 280,000 mu of summer cotton. They harvested over 300 jin of wheat per mu in the summer and over 200 jin of cotton seeds per mu in the autumn. The farmers happily said, "One wheat, one cotton" means both grain and money; one crop of wheat in the summer and one crop of cotton in the autumn, eating white flour and spending cotton money. Based on the experience created by the farmers, Yue Qifeng clearly pointed out that "one wheat, one cotton" is a reform of the planting system, and the entire province south of the "Three-Eight Line" should widely promote the planting of multiple summer cotton varieties. He also inspected the Stone Farm Scientific Research Institute's use of 12 crops intercropped with cotton, creating high-yield and high-efficiency experiences, believing that the entire province's plain areas should take the path of intercropping cotton and grain. Whatever is suitable for intercropping should be intercropped, whether it is wheat, beans, vegetables, or garlic. He required that through the above planting reforms, the dual goals of increasing both grain and cotton production be achieved.

### 既要“金波”滚  又要“银浪”翻  河北将推广粮棉间作制

　　既要“金波”滚  又要“银浪”翻
　　河北将推广粮棉间作制
    本报石家庄10月23日电　记者陈国琦报道：如何从根本上解决棉粮争地矛盾，实现棉粮同步增产？河北省省长岳岐峰最近提出了依靠科技、推广棉粮套种间作或“一麦一棉”新思路。
    河北是全国粮棉主产省份之一，棉粮争地的矛盾仍然比较突出。为从根本上解决这个问题，岳岐峰带领农业专家和省直有关部门负责同志，多次深入到一些地县的田间地头，和农民及农村干部共商计策。农民在种植制度上改革的实践使岳岐峰认识到，提高种棉效益，单靠国家提高收购价格不行。必须依靠科技投入，把产量、品质搞上去，把效益拿回来；改革种植制度，扩大复种指数和土地利用效益。
    地处冀南平原的威县、邱县、肥乡、成安等4县，搞“一麦一棉”，已有几年历史，形成一定规模。4县今年就种夏播棉28万亩。夏收300多公斤小麦，秋收200多公斤籽棉。群众高兴地说，“一麦一棉”，有粮有钱；夏季一茬麦，秋季一茬棉，吃的是白面，花的棉花钱。根据群众创造的这一经验，岳岐峰明确指出，“一麦一棉”是一种种植制度的改革，全省“三八”线以南要普遍推广多种夏播棉。他还考察了石家庄农科所用12种作物和棉花套种间作，创出亩产高效益的经验，认为全省平原地区要走棉粮间作套种的种植路子。适合套种什么，就套种什么，小麦、杂豆、蔬菜、大蒜都可以。他要求，通过上述种植改革，达到粮棉双增产目标。
