	Zhepang Temple
	Yè Jùnyuǎn

	The numerous temples in Tibet are world-renowned, and the largest among them is Zhepang Temple. It is said that at its peak, the temple had over seven thousand seven hundred lamas.

	Leaving Lhasa City and heading west for several dozen miles, you will reach Zhepang Temple. "Zhepang" in Tibetan means "a pile of rice." This temple was built by Zongkapa's favorite disciple, Gyeltsen Chökyi Gyaltsen, in the year 1416 (the 14th year of the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty). After its completion, Gyeltsen Chökyi Gyaltsen became the first abbot, and since then, there have been a total of twenty-three abbots.

	The temple is built against the mountain, with layers of buildings stacked like a small city. White monastic buildings and red halls are interspersed, stretching all the way up the mountain. The golden roofs of the halls shine brightly, and large rocks are painted with images of Sakyamuni. The stone-paved paths between the buildings are winding and deep.

	The most important building within the temple is the Tsokchen Hall, where lamas gather to chant scriptures. It is grand and magnificent, with a depth of several dozen meters and dozens of massive pillars standing in between. The cushions used by the lamas for chanting are laid out in rows from the first pillar at the entrance all the way to the front of the Buddha statue. According to Tibetan custom, when entering a temple or encountering a stupa, one must walk around it in a clockwise direction. We started from the left, so we first saw the murals. Studying the murals in Tibetan temples can help one understand the history of Tibet. The best-preserved sculptures in the hall include those in the main hall and the side halls. There are several side halls, housing statues of Zongkapa, Amitayus Buddha, Guanyin, Gyeltsen Chökyi Gyaltsen, and many others. These statues are vivid and lifelike. In particular, the large statue of Manjushri and the white parasol in the main hall are exquisite and lifelike.

	Of course, the most valuable items in the temple are the hundreds of Buddhist scriptures it houses. Many of these scriptures are handwritten with gold powder. Each scripture is protected by two ivory boards carved with patterns, one on top and one on the bottom. This batch of priceless works not only contains explanations of the essence of Buddhism and accounts of the development of Buddhism but also records the politics and economy of Tibet, as well as introductions to its customs and culture.

	The Party and the state have always placed great importance on the historical relics of all ethnic groups. Famous temples like Zhepang Temple, known both in China and abroad, have long been listed as national key cultural relics protection units. In recent years, the government has repeatedly allocated funds for their restoration.

    哲蚌寺
    叶君远
    西藏寺庙之多举世闻名，其中最大的，要数哲蚌寺，据说香火最盛时，喇嘛多达七千七百多人。
    出拉萨城，往西几十里，便是哲蚌寺。“哲蚌”，藏文的意思是“堆积大米”。这个寺是由黄教祖师宗喀巴的得意弟子绛央曲杰于公元一四一六年（明朝永乐十四年）兴建的。建成后，绛央曲杰任首任法台，此后，法台共延续了二十三任。
    寺庙是倚山而建的，群楼层叠，宛如一座小城。白色的僧楼和红色的殿宇错落参差，一直绵延到山腰。殿宇的金顶熠熠闪光，一些巨大的山石上彩绘着释迦牟尼像，建筑物间的石砌小径弯曲而幽深。
    寺内最主要的建筑——错钦大殿是喇嘛集体诵经的场所，雄伟壮观，进深几十米，几十根合抱的大柱矗立其间，喇嘛诵经用的坐垫一条一条从进门第一排柱子一直铺到佛像前。按照藏族习俗，进寺庙，遇宝塔，必须循顺时针方向绕行。我们从左转起，所以首先看清的是壁画。研究西藏寺庙的壁画，有利于了解西藏的历史。殿内保存较好的是那些塑像，包括大殿中间的和厢殿的。厢殿有好几座，供奉着宗喀巴、无量寿佛、观音以及绛央曲杰等许多塑像。这些塑像，各具神态，生动极了。特别是大殿中间的大文殊像和白伞盖像，精妙传神。
    当然，寺内最有价值的还要算珍藏的几百部佛教经典了。这些佛经很多是用金粉手书的。每一部佛经，都用两块镌刻着花纹的象牙板上下夹护着。这批价值连城的著作，不仅包含着对佛教精义的阐释、佛教发展的述说，而且包含着对西藏政治经济的记载，风俗文化的介绍。
    党和国家对各民族的历史文物向来都是十分重视的。像哲蚌寺这样的中外闻名的圣地早已列为国家重点文物保护单位，最近几年，政府多次拨款修复。
