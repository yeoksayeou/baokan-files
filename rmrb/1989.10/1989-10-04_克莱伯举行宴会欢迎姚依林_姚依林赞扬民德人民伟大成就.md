Kliber Holds Banquet to Welcome Yao Yilin
Yao Yilin Praises the Great Achievements of the People of the GDR

	BERLIN, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- A banquet was held by Gunter Kliber, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, at the state guesthouse to welcome the Chinese party and government delegation led by Yao Yilin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council.

	In his toast, Kliber highly praised the deepening development of the relations between the two parties and the two countries in recent years. He said that on some major issues in the current world, the two sides have consistent standpoints and views. The party and government of the German Democratic Republic believe that under the leadership of the tested Communist Party of China, China will achieve greater successes in socialist construction.

	On the current international situation, this German Democratic Republic politician pointed out that although détente is irreversible, the imperialist forces are still determined to destroy us. They are launching an offensive against socialism, with the German Democratic Republic being the first target. The reactionary forces have made the class struggle and ideological struggle in the current international relations more acute.

	Yao Yilin, in his speech, praised the German Democratic Republic for its 40-year achievements under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which has formulated policies in line with the national conditions and, through hard struggle, has made the German Democratic Republic one of the advanced countries in the world. Yao Yilin pointed out that in the 40 years since the founding of New China, despite some detours in the cause of socialist construction, China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, has achieved remarkable achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. Especially since the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee to implement the policy of reform and opening up, the achievements have been even more significant. The facts have proved that only socialism can save China, and the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the fundamental guarantee for the realization of socialism in China.

	Yao Yilin expressed that the Chinese party and government will, on the basis of mutual understanding, mutual respect, mutual trust, and equality and mutual benefit, long-term, stable, in-depth, and comprehensive development of friendly cooperative relations with the German Democratic Republic.

    克莱伯举行宴会欢迎姚依林
    姚依林赞扬民德人民伟大成就
    本报柏林10月2日电　记者许宏治、新华社记者王德峰报道：德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、民主德国部长会议第一副主席克莱伯今晚在国宾馆举行宴会，欢迎由中共中央政治局常委、国务院副总理姚依林率领的中国党政代表团。
    克莱伯在祝酒辞中高度评价两党、两国关系近年来的深入发展。他说，对当前世界上一些重大问题，双方的立场和看法是一致的。民主德国党和政府表示相信，在久经考验的中国共产党的领导下，中国在社会主义建设中将会取得更大的成就。
    对于当前国际局势，这位民主德国政治家指出，缓和虽不可逆转，但帝国主义势力“亡我之心不死”。他们正在掀起一场反对社会主义的攻势，民主德国首当其冲。反动势力使当前国际关系中的阶级斗争和意识形态斗争变得更加尖锐。
    姚依林在讲话中赞扬民主德国40年来在德国统一社会党领导下，制定了符合本国国情的方针，经过艰苦奋斗，使民主德国跻身于世界先进国家的行列。姚依林指出，新中国成立40年来，尽管在社会主义建设事业中走过一些弯路，但在中国共产党领导下，仍然取得了举世瞩目的成就。特别是十一届三中全会决定实行改革开放政策以来，成就更为显著。事实雄辩地证明，只有社会主义才能救中国，而中国共产党的领导是在中国实现社会主义的根本保证。
    姚依林表示，中国党和政府将在相互理解、相互尊重、相互信任和平等互利的基础上，长期、稳定、深入、全面地发展同民主德国的友好合作关系。
