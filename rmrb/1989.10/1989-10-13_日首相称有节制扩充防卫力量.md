Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu stated on the 12th that Japan must "moderately" expand its defense capabilities. He believes that the situation in Asia is still far from easing.

Kaifu made these remarks during a session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee in response to questions from Kiyoshi Ichikawa, the Secretary-General of the Clean Government Party. Ichikawa proposed that the government, when formulating the next defense reinforcement plan (from the 1991 fiscal year to the 1996 fiscal year), should not exceed 22.5 trillion yen in total defense spending. This would keep the annual defense budget within one percent of the country's gross national product for each fiscal year.

Ichikawa emphasized that the world is transitioning from a state of tension to one of easing, and if the Japanese government continues to increase defense spending as it has in the past, it will not gain the support of its citizens.

The Japanese government recently reiterated in its defense white paper its consistent policy that Japan needs to strengthen its defense capabilities.

    日首相称有节制扩充防卫力量
    日本首相海部俊树十二日说，日本必须“有节制地”扩充防卫力量。他认为亚洲形势距缓和尚远。
    海部是在众议院预算委员会上回答公明党书记长市川等议员的质询时说这番话的。市川提出，政府在制定下一个（自一九九一年度至一九九六年度）充实防卫力量计划时，军费总额不应超过二十二点五万亿日元。这样平均每年度的防卫费就可以控制在当年度国民生产总值的百分之一以内。
    市川强调说，世界正处于从紧张走向缓和的时代，日本政府如果还同以往一样增加防卫费，是得不到国民支持的。
    日本政府在前不久发表的防卫白皮书中，重申了日本需要加强防卫力量的一贯方针。
