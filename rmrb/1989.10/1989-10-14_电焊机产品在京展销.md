    Welding Machine Products on Display in Beijing

    A reporter from this newspaper, Lü Jìchuán, reports: On October 11, the National Energy-Saving New Products Exhibition of Welding Machines and Welding Materials opened in Beijing.

    Nearly 70 manufacturers are participating in this exhibition, showcasing products in 10 categories. Among them, the energy-saving new products reflecting the standards of the 1980s, the series of thyristor-controlled rectifier arc welding machines, have an efficiency 22% higher than that of electric drive direct current arc welding machines and are more than 50% lighter in weight. Each machine can save nearly 4,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. The high-efficiency energy-saving thyristor-controlled welding machines, compared to manual welding, can increase production efficiency by 1.2 to 2.4 times.
