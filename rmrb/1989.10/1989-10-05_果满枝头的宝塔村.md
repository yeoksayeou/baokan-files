Lake Province Xianning City Bao Ta Village has a population of over 600 people and 500 mu of farmland. For countless generations, the villagers have lived in poverty. In the early 1980s, reforms pushed Bao Ta Village onto the stage of commodity economy. The village party branch leadership pondered: with only 0.84 mu of farmland per person, how could they become wealthy? They tried setting up a factory, but it failed; they attempted to do business outside the village, but they incurred losses. During a meeting of the branch committee, someone suggested:

“Follow the example of Old Pan. Use the idle land in front of and behind the houses to plant flowers and fruits!”

The branch secretary, Pan Yongfu, immediately agreed: “Right! We should develop courtyard economy.”

Twenty years ago, Pan Yonghan had already started planting fruit trees collectively. After the land was distributed to households in 1983, he opened a 2.5 mu flower and fruit garden on the ruins in front of his house. The following year, he earned several thousand yuan. To get the villagers to follow Old Pan's example and make money, the work seemed easy, but the party branch shouted themselves hoarse with no effect.

After further investigation, it turned out that the villagers were afraid of “change.” The best way to dispel the villagers' concerns was for the party members to take the lead. Branch secretary Pan Yongfu planted 120 citrus trees by the village; the village head, Pan Shigong, cultivated over 2,000 camphor trees; committee member Pan Yongyan grafted several thousand citrus seedlings… All 23 party members in the village took action. Seeing the party members planting trees and growing fruits, some of whom had already made a bit of money, the villagers were inspired. They said: “If the party members can get rich, we can too.”

Once the villagers started working, how would they solve the problem of seedlings? The party branch lent seeds and seedlings from the homes of party members and cadres to the villagers. Young party member Pan Chuanzhong dug up over 5,000 seedlings from his own garden and distributed them to those who lacked seedlings; old party member Pan Yonghan helped the impoverished Pan Chuangmao establish a 1 mu seedling nursery. That year, he almost went to Pan Chuangmao's field every week. That year, this impoverished household earned 1,100 yuan.

By 1985, almost every household in Bao Ta Village had planted citrus trees and flowers. At this time, what the villagers needed most was technology. To help everyone solve their problems, the village appointed a vice-village head responsible for technical matters to teach everyone technology and solve general technical problems. Under the leadership and help of the party members, now Bao Ta Village has 109 mu of citrus trees, 20 mu of peach trees, 5 mu of grape gardens, and 26 mu of various flowers and trees in front of and behind the houses. Additionally, the villagers also raise pigs, ducks, fish, rabbits, and bullfrogs, which have all found a home in Bao Ta Village.

The courtyard economy has helped Bao Ta Village bid farewell to poverty. In 1988, except for 6 five-guarantee households, the remaining 144 households all had incomes of over 3,000 yuan, with 23 households earning over 10,000 yuan. Now, Bao Ta Village is lush with greenery, and every branch is laden with fruits.

    果满枝头的宝塔村
    涂昭镜　张兴旺
    湖北咸宁市宝塔村，600多人，伴着500亩耕地不知过了多少辈的穷日子。80年代初，改革把宝塔村人推上商品经济舞台。村党支部一班人思考着，人均只有0.84亩耕地，怎样才能致富呢？办工厂，垮了；外出经商，亏了。在一次支委会上，有人说：
  “干老潘那行，用房前屋后空闲地种花兴果！”党支书潘永富立即表示赞成：对！走发展庭院经济之路。
    潘永汉20年前就在集体盘果树，田地包到户后的1983年，他在房前破窑基上开了2.5亩花果园，次年就收入几千元。要群众照老潘的样子赚钱，工作照说不难做，可党支部喊破嗓子却不见效果。
    深一了解，原来是怕
  “变”。消除群众顾虑的最好办法是党员带头。党支书潘永富在村旁栽了120棵柑桔，村主任潘世功育了2000多株樟树，支委潘永炎也嫁接几千棵桔苗……全村23名党员都动起来了。看着党员栽树种果，有的已赚了一把票子，群众动了心。大家说：“党员富得，我们也富得。”
    群众都干起来了，种苗怎么解决？党支部将党员、干部家的种籽、树苗赊给大伙。青年党员潘传忠，从自家园里挖出5000多棵苗木分给缺苗户；老党员潘永汉帮困难户潘传茂办起一亩苗圃。那年，他几乎每星期都要往潘传茂地里跑一趟。当年，这家困难户收入1100元。
    到了1985年，宝塔村几乎家家都栽了柑桔，种了花草。这时，群众最需要的是技术。为了给大家排忧解难，村里配了一名专管技术的村委会副主任，给大家讲技术，并能解决一般技术问题。在党员的带动和帮助下，现在，宝塔村房前屋后栽柑桔109亩、桃树20亩、葡萄园5亩、各类花木26亩。此外，村民们还养猪、养鸭、养鱼，长毛兔、牛蛙等也在宝塔村安了家。
    庭院经济使宝塔村人告别了贫困。1988年，全村除6个五保户外，其余144户，收入都在3000元以上，其中23户收入上万元。如今的宝塔村，家家庭院苗木苍翠，果实满枝。
