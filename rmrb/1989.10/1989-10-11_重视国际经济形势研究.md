The current world economy and international relations are at a crucial turning point. In late August, the Chinese Society of International Studies held a meeting in Beijing, where many scholars and experts shared their views on this topic.

Regarding the economic situation in the West, some participants noted that, overall, the Western economy has been experiencing low growth and low inflation. However, since last year, inflation has been increasing, prompting various countries to adopt tightening measures, such as raising discount rates and tightening monetary policy to curb overheating. As a result, some countries have seen a decline in profit rates. In the foreign exchange market, there have been fluctuations, with interest rate volatility exceeding exchange rate volatility. This is mainly due to the strengthened coordination and intervention in the foreign exchange market by Western European countries.

Many participants pointed out that the international debt crisis remains severe and shows little sign of improvement. The crisis is characterized by large debt amounts and a wide range of affected countries. Resolving the debt crisis fundamentally will depend on the attitudes of developed countries.

Some participants emphasized that analyzing the world economic situation requires paying close attention to the trends in the U.S. economy. From 1983 to 1986, the U.S. economy experienced continuous growth, suggesting that the Western economy will continue to develop positively in the 1990s.

During the discussion, participants expressed great concern about the trends of regionalization and bloc formation in the world economy. Specifically, the European Economic Community is set to establish a unified market by 1992, the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement has become a reality, and discussions are underway to establish an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization involving the U.S., Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and ASEAN countries. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is also undergoing active reforms. We need to have corresponding strategies for these developments.

Some participants particularly emphasized the inseparable connection between international economics and international politics, noting that the global structure in the 1980s has shown a trend of shifting from bipolarity to multipolarity, both economically and politically. The easing of political tensions between the East and West will inevitably lead to strengthened economic cooperation, such as the mutual recognition between the CMEA and the EEC. Western Europe needs Eastern Europe's resources and markets, while Eastern Europe needs Western Europe's technology and capital. From a global development perspective, the competition among nations is centered on comprehensive national power, including economic strength and scientific and technological capabilities. Our era remains one of peace, development, and cooperation.

Regarding the three sets of relationships in international economic relations, some participants noted that concerning North-South relations, the 1970s saw the proposal to establish a new international economic order, which was largely a situation of the South attacking and the North defending. However, after the Cancun Summit in the 1980s, the situation shifted to the North attacking and the South defending. It is predicted that in the 1990s, North-South relations may reach a stalemate, with the international environment for developing countries worsening.

Regarding the relationships among developed countries, post-war, especially since the 1970s, international coordination has strengthened, making these relationships more stable, stronger, and mature.

Regarding East-West economic relations, with the easing of political tensions and dialogue, economic cooperation and mutual openness are inevitable.

Regarding the outlook for the world economy in the 1990s, after analyzing six factors influencing the development of the world economy, most participants believe that the overall situation will be positive, with economic stability and growth likely to continue, and the risk of a major recession being low.

The six factors are: First, the new scientific and technological revolution. The 1990s will see broader breakthroughs. Second, the technological transformation of traditional industries. New technologies will not only promote the development of emerging industries but also, more importantly, modernize traditional industries. Third, economic adjustment and reform have become a global trend. Fourth, international coordination, with developed countries strengthening coordination in financial and trade sectors, has changed the economic cycles in the West. Fifth, the prices of primary commodities are stabilizing. Sixth, international political and military situations are easing.

    重视国际经济形势研究
    庞中英
    当前，世界经济和国际关系处在十分重要的转折时期。八月下旬中国国际关系学会在北京召开的一次会议上，许多学者专家对此提出了自己的见解。
    关于西方经济形势，有的同志认为，总的来看，整个西方经济发展呈现低速低通货膨胀的态势，但自去年以来，西方总的通货膨胀又有所增加，为此各国采取了紧缩对策，提高贴现率，收紧银根、抑制经济过热，从而造成一些国家利润率有所下降。从外汇市场看，有起有伏，利率波幅有超过汇率波幅的趋势。这主要是由于西欧各国加强了协调和对外汇市场的干预。
    有不少同志指出，国际债务危机严重，没有多少改变，其特点是债务数量大和涉及的国家多，要从根本上解决债务危机问题，还要看发达国家的态度。
    有的同志指出，分析世界经济形势，美国经济的动向很重要。一九八三——一九八六年，美国经济走势一直处于增长状态，因而九十年代的西方经济仍会向好的发展方向前进。
    讨论中，大家都很关注世界经济中地区化、集团化的趋势，特别是欧洲经济共同体将在一九九二年搞统一大市场，美加自由贸易联盟已成事实，美、日、澳、新和东盟国家也将讨论设立亚太经济合作机构，苏联东欧的经互会也在积极改革，我们对此应有相应的对策。
    有的同志特别强调了国际经济与国际政治的密不可分的内在联系，指出，八十年代的世界格局无论从经济还是从政治上看都出现了从两极向多极转化的大趋势。东西方政治上的缓和必然导致经济合作的加强，如经互会与欧共体两大经济集团已相互承认，西欧需要东欧的资源、市场，东欧需要西欧的技术、资金。从全球发展大趋势上讲，国与国间的竞争是以经济实力和科学技术为核心的综合国力的竞争。我们的时代仍是和平、发展和合作的时代。
    谈到国际经济关系中的三对关系时，有的同志说，关于南北关系，七十年代提出建立国际经济新秩序，基本上是南攻北守的态势；但八十年代坎昆会议以后，转为北攻南守。预测到九十年代有可能出现南北关系的僵持不下，发展中世界面临的国际环境更加恶化。
    关于发达国家之间的关系，战后特别是七十年代发展起来的国际协调的加强，这种关系趋向稳定、加强、成熟。
    关于东西方经济关系，随着政治上的缓和对话，经济的合作和相互开放也是必然的。
    关于九十年代世界经济的展望，多数同志在分析了九十年代影响世界经济发展的六个因素后，认为，九十年代总的形势是好的，仍可能保持经济稳定增长，不大可能出现大的衰退。
    这六个因素是：一、新的科学与技术革命。九十年代将有更广泛的突破。二、传统产业的技术改造。新技术除了促进新兴产业部门的发展外，更主要的是促进传统产业现代化。三、经济调整和改革成为世界性潮流。四、国际协调，发达国家之间在金融和贸易领域的协调使西方经济周期出现了变化。五、初级产品价格趋于稳定。六、国际政治军事形势趋向缓和。
