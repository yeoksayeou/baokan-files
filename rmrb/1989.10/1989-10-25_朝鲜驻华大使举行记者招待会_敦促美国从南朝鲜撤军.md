North Korean Ambassador Holds Press Conference Urging U.S. to Withdraw from South Korea

	People's Daily, Beijing, October 24th – Correspondent Zhou Bizhong reports: North Korean Ambassador to China, Chu Changjun, stated today during a press conference that peace on the Korean Peninsula can only be guaranteed by the withdrawal of U.S. troops. If "military balance" is for peace, it should not be about increasing military strength but rather significantly reducing it, by withdrawing U.S. troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea.

	This press conference was held in response to South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's recent visit to the U.S. During his speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on the 18th, Roh stated that if the U.S. suddenly withdraws its forces, it could "lead to tragedy."

	Chu Changjun said that Roh Tae-woo should abandon the foolish delusion of relying on external forces to prolong his rule. The U.S. should also abandon its plan to support the Roh Tae-woo regime and to use South Korea as a permanent military base.

	In response to questions about North Korea-U.S. relations, Chu Changjun expressed that North Korea is willing to normalize relations with the U.S. according to internationally recognized principles. He stated that over the past year, representatives from both countries at the counselor level have had four unofficial meetings. We are willing to engage in higher-level contacts, including government and parliamentary representatives. If the U.S. withdraws its troops from South Korea, does not interfere in North Korea's internal affairs, and respects our sovereignty, North Korea-U.S. relations will improve.

　　朝鲜驻华大使举行记者招待会
　　敦促美国从南朝鲜撤军
    本报北京10月24日讯　记者周必忠报道：朝鲜驻华大使朱昌骏今天在这里接受记者采访时表示，朝鲜半岛的和平只有靠撤走美军来保证，如果“武力均衡”是为了和平，那就不应该是增强武力，而应该是大幅度裁减武力，从南朝鲜撤走美军和核武器。
    这次记者招待会是针对南朝鲜总统卢泰愚最近访美时的讲话举行的。卢泰愚18日在美国会两院会议上发表讲演称，如果美国突然撤走武力，就可能“招来悲剧”。
    朱昌骏说，卢泰愚应该抛弃依靠外力延命的愚蠢的妄想，美国也应该放弃扶持卢泰愚政权和把南朝鲜作为自己的军事基地而永远呆下去的打算。
    在回答记者关于朝美关系的提问时，朱昌骏表示，朝鲜愿意按照国际公认的准则同美国实现关系正常化。他说，去年以来，朝美双方参赞级别的代表进行了4次非正式接触。我们愿意同美国进行包括政府和议会在内的更高级别代表的接触。如果美国从南朝鲜撤军，不干涉朝鲜的内政，尊重我们的自主权，朝美关系就会变好。
