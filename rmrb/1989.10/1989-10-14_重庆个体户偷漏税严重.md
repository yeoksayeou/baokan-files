Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 13th.

	The problem of tax evasion by individual households in Chongqing is severe.

	By the end of September this year, individual households across the city had paid back over 15 million yuan in evaded taxes. This figure is more than double the amount paid back by individual households over the four years from 1985 to 1988. Another figure shows that out of the city's more than 110,000 individual households, 90% completed self-inspections and self-reporting. The tax authorities then checked 13,730 of these households and found that the amount of taxes these households should pay back was ten times the amount they had self-reported. These individual households used various methods to evade taxes, such as hiding their business income, falsifying accounts, and issuing fake invoices. Some even engaged in the illegal trade of scarce and important production materials and resources, reaping enormous profits.

    重庆个体户偷漏税严重
    新华社重庆十月十三日电（记者向虎）重庆个体户偷漏税情况严重。
    今年到九月底，全市个体户补交偷漏税款一千五百多万元，这个数字是一九八五年至一九八八年个体户四年补交税款的一倍多。另一个数字是，全市十一万多个体户中的百分之九十进行完自查自报后，税务机关对其中的一万三千七百三十户进行了检查，检查出的个体户应缴补税款是这些个体户自查自报数的十倍。这些个体户采取隐匿营业额、做假帐、开假发票等多种形式偷漏税款，有的还倒卖国家紧俏重要生产资料和物资，牟取暴利。
