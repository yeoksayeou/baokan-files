How to educate children is a topic frequently discussed by adults. In fact, children often provide examples for adults and society to learn from. In the past, the stories of young heroes like Liu Wenzhi and the Grassland Hero Sisters inspired a generation of young people. Today, the "National Top Ten Young Pioneers" selected by the Communist Youth League, the China Youth and Children's Working Committee, and other departments, especially the late Lai Ning, are excellent children who can teach us a lot.

Lai Ning lived only 14 years, a short life. However, reading the report on his deeds (see today's fourth page of this newspaper) reveals that a beautiful soul does not lose its luster just because life is short. Instead, he illuminated the meaning of life with his brilliant life. Lai Ning admired outstanding figures from a young age and had great aspirations, but he also knew that great deeds start with small actions. He lived in a remote and isolated mountainous area, but he was eager to learn and read extensively, broadening his horizons and achieving outstanding results in many areas. Most notably, Lai Ning had a noble sentiment—he loved his hometown and the people. It was this sentiment that drove him to risk his life to explore for minerals and treasure for his hometown, to go up the mountain three times to extinguish forest fires, and ultimately to sacrifice his young life. Of course, Lai Ning was still a child; he might even have tried to poke a wasp nest for an essay titled "Poking a Wasp Nest." However, it was this serious spirit that cultivated his love for science and his courage to practice.

The double amputee Cheng Jie, whose awarded calligraphy work "Where there is a will, there is a way" was written with her feet, is even more remarkable. These children became the best among their peers not just because of their unique talents, but more importantly because of their extraordinary perseverance and unremitting struggle. This quality is not only inspiring to young people.

If asked what the "Top Ten Youth" represent in terms of their era, it should be said that the most prominent feature is that they are excellent in both character and academics, and they are well-rounded, which is the direction that contemporary youth should strive for together.

If asked how they grew into outstanding youth, it should be said that the most important reason is that they understood and practiced the highest ideal and belief of the Young Pioneers: "The interests of the people are above all else."

The "Top Ten Youth" grew up under the nurturing of the Party and the people, under the education of the Young Pioneers, the Communist Youth League, and the schools. They will never forget the love of their parents, the enlightenment of their teachers, and the care and cultivation of society as a whole. All of this inspires us to create a better environment for more children to grow up in.

The "Top Ten Youth" have set an example for young people across the country. Of course, learning from the "Top Ten Youth" is not just the children's responsibility, because the spirit of vigor and progress they embody, and the ideal and belief they practice—"The interests of the people are above all else"—are also what our entire society advocates.

    自古英雄出少年
    本报评论员
    怎样教育孩子，是成年人经常谈论的话题。其实，孩子也时常为大人、为全社会提供学习的榜样。当年，英雄少年刘文学、草原英雄小姐妹的事迹，曾脍炙人口，激励一代少年儿童的成长。今天，团中央、中国少工委等部门联合评选出的“全国十佳少先队员”，尤其是其中已经牺牲了的赖宁同学，就是能给人们许多教益的好孩子。
    赖宁只活了14个年头，人生短促。然而，细读介绍他事迹的通讯（见今日本报第四版）就会发现，一颗美好的心灵并不因生命短促而丢失光彩。相反，他用生命的辉煌燃烧揭示了人生的真谛。赖宁从小崇拜杰出人物，胸怀大志，但他也懂得做大事要从做小事开始；他生活在一个偏僻而封闭的山区，但他求知若渴、博览群书，从而开阔了视野，在多方面获得突出的成果；尤其难能可贵的，是赖宁那种高尚的情感——热爱家乡，热爱人民。正是这种情感，促使他冒险为家乡探矿寻宝，三次上山扑打林火，并终于为此献出年幼的生命。当然，赖宁毕竟是孩子，他甚至可能为了一篇《捅马蜂窝》的作文，而真的去捅马蜂窝。但是，正是这种认真的精神，使他养成热爱科学、勇于实践的优良品质。
    那位双臂残废的成洁，她获奖的书法作品——“有志者事竟成”，是用脚写成的，更是用一颗不屈的心写成的。这些孩子，之所以能成为同辈人中的“尖子”，不仅是天赋独具，更重要的是有过人的毅力，不懈的奋斗。这种品质，不独对少年儿童有启迪。
    如果问这“少年十佳”有什么时代特点，应该说，最鲜明的是，他们品学兼优、全面发展，这正是当代少年需要共同努力的方向。
    如果问他们何以成长为杰出少年，应该说，最重要的原因就在于，他们懂得并用行动实践了“人民的利益高于一切”这一少先队的最高理想和信念。
    “少年十佳”是在党和人民的哺育下，在少先队、共青团组织和学校的教育下成长起来的。他们忘不了的，是父母的舐犊之情，是教师的启蒙之恩，是全社会的关怀培育。这一切启发我们，应该为更多的孩子创造更为良好的成长环境。
    “少年十佳”为全国青少年树立了学习的榜样。当然，学习“少年十佳”不仅是孩子们的事，因为他们身上所体现出的朝气蓬勃、奋发向上的精神风貌，他们所实践的“人民的利益高于一切”的理想和信念，也正是我们全社会所提倡的。
