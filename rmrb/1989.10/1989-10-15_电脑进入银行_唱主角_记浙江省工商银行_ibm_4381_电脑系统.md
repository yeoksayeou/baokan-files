Do you still remember the sound of abacus beads clicking away when you walked into a savings bank? The noise, like popping beans, was high and low, without interruption. "By the end of the day, my head would be buzzing, and I'd feel dizzy," an old banker sighed.

Those who work in banks know that an abacus and a pen have always been the basic tools of the trade. "If you can't use the abacus well, the boss will fire you," this was the case in banks and private money shops before liberation. Even after liberation, up until the 1980s, many savings banks and branches in China still relied on the abacus to get the job done.

In August 1987, the Zhejiang Provincial Commercial Bank introduced two sets of high-capacity, fully-functional IBM 4381 computer systems and over 600 matching terminals, initially establishing a large computer network centered in Hangzhou. Twenty-five branches of the bank in Hangzhou were gradually integrated into the network. The mainframe in the city's computer center stores over a million accounts of various types, handling over 80,000 transactions daily at peak times, which accounts for more than 50% of the total business volume of Hangzhou Commercial Bank.

That day, we specially visited the "heart" of the 4381 machine—the Hangzhou Computer Training Center. The spacious and bright center room was filled with workers in white coats working in an orderly manner. Engineer Yuan said that this 4381 machine is currently the most advanced computer system among domestic peers, with the mainframe capable of performing 2.7 million calculations per second. Yuan led us to dozens of machines flashing red lights and told us that these were the connectors linked to various savings banks and branches of Hangzhou Commercial Bank. Each transaction processed at the branches would be displayed here. In the past, processing a single current deposit transaction manually took about 120 seconds at the fastest. Now, with computer operations, it only takes 60 seconds, doubling the speed. Previously, bank staff dreaded the year-end interest settlement for current deposits. During this time, they had to work overtime, busy and hectic. For example, settling the annual interest for 100,000 current deposit accounts in Hangzhou used to require 300 people working a full day to complete. Now, with the computer network system for centralized processing, it only takes about an hour and a half.

In the past, due to manual operations, long queues were common in banks. On one side, depositors complained, and on the other, savings clerks nervously flipped cards, filled out forms, and calculated interest, often making mistakes. Since the 4381 machine went online, 20 savings banks in busy areas like Hangzhou's Yan'an Road, Liberation Road, and Wulin Gate have been networked, offering inter-bank deposits and withdrawals. Deposits made at one branch can be withdrawn at another, greatly alleviating the congestion at the counters. Additionally, due to the computer network, the time for funds in transit has been shortened. The settlement of transaction funds between enterprises usually only takes a few minutes to be credited to the account for turnover, whereas it used to take two or three days, and even longer for out-of-town transactions. Nearly 20,000 enterprises and factories that have opened accounts at nearly 20 networked branches and sub-branches of Hangzhou Commercial Bank process nearly 50,000 transactions daily. Such a large amount of fund turnover, when processed using the computer network, conservatively calculates that the city increases liquid funds by 3 million yuan daily.

The clacking of abacus beads has now been replaced by the computer network connecting all directions. The transition from manual to computer operations in Zhejiang's banking sector is currently at the forefront of the national banking system. Zhejiang Provincial Commercial Bank plans to pilot the 4381 computer network connection between Hangzhou, Beijing, and Jinan in the next two years, preparing for a nationwide network.

    电脑进入银行“唱主角”
    ——记浙江省工商银行IBM4381电脑系统

    不知你还有没有这样的印象，走进银行储蓄所，耳膜里便撞入噼噼啪啪的算盘珠声。这声音，像爆豆，高低起伏，没有间歇。“那时候，一天下来，脑子里还嗡嗡发响，人弄的昏头胀脑”，一位老银行感叹道。
    吃“银行饭”的都知道，一把算盘一支笔，历来是银行的基本功。“算盘笃不好，老板要回报”，这在解放前的银行、私人钱庄不用说了。就是解放后，一直到80年代，我国不少银行储蓄所、办事处，还是依靠算盘“唱主角”。
    1987年8月，浙江省工商银行引进两套容量大，功能齐全的IBM4381电脑系统设备和600多台配套终端，初步建立了一个以杭州为中心的省内最大的电脑网络系统。杭州市有25家工行分支机构先后纳入网内，市区电脑中心的4381主机已存储各类帐户100余万户，高峰期日处理业务8万余笔，是杭州市工行整个业务量的50％以上。
    那天，我们特地去4381机的“心脏”——杭州计算机培训中心采访，宽敞明亮的中心机房内，身着白大褂的工作人员井然有序地工作。袁总工程师说，这套4381机，是目前国内同行中最先进的电脑系统，主机每秒可运算270万次。袁总带我们来到数十台闪着红灯的机器前，她告诉我们，这就是和杭州工商银行各储蓄所、办事处联网的联接器，各所每办一笔业务，都会在这里显示出来。过去，储蓄员办理一笔活期储蓄业务，手工作业最快也约需120秒，现在电脑作业，只要60秒钟，速度提高一倍。以前银行工作人员最怕年底活期存款帐户的结息，每到这时，便要加班加点，忙得团团转。就拿杭州市内10万活期存款帐户的年度结息来说，过去手工作业，300多人忙一天，才能处理完。现在采用电脑网络系统集中处理，只需1个多小时就能完成。
    过去，由于采用手工作业，银行里排队是司空见惯的。一边是储户怨声不断，一边储蓄员神情紧张地翻卡、填写、算息，弄得不好，还要出差错。自从4381机开通后，杭州延安路、解放路、武林门等繁华地带的20家储蓄所实行联网，开办了通存通兑业务，储户在这个所存的钱，可以到其它所去取，那种临柜拥挤的现象就大大缓解了。同时，由于电脑联网，缩短了资金的在途时间，厂家双方成交的货款，一般只需几分钟就可以打入帐户，用来周转，而以往一般要两三天，如果是外地时间就更长。在杭州工行近20家已电脑联网的办事处、分理处开户的企业和工厂近2万家，日处理业务近5万笔，这样多的资金周转改用电脑网络处理，按最保守的计算，全市每天等于增加流动资金300万元。
    昔日算盘珠子的笃响，如今计算机网络通四方。浙江省银行界的这场手工到电脑化的革命，目前走在全国银行系统的前列。浙江省工商银行计划在今明两年首先在杭州与北京、济南三大城市之间实行4381电脑联网的试点，为全国大联网做好准备。
