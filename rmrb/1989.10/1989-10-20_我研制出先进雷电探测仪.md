    Beijing experienced a total of 6,583 lightning strikes this summer, with the strongest one occurring on the night of July 1 near Han Zhuang in Pinggu County. The peak current of this lightning strike reached 446 kiloamperes, equivalent to the explosive power of several tons of high explosives. These findings were obtained using a lightning detection device developed by the Space Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    This advanced high-tech detection equipment fills a gap in China's capabilities in this area and provides a powerful tool for lightning location and prevention. Experts believe that this device has important applications in aviation, power systems, forestry, and other fields for lightning protection, and its performance has reached international advanced levels.

    我研制出先进雷电探测仪
    本报讯　记者杨良化报道：北京地区今年夏天共打雷6583个，而最强的一个雷是7月1日晚打在平谷县韩庄附近，其电流峰值达446千安，相当于数吨烈性炸药爆炸的威力。这是中科院空间中心研制的雷电探测仪所取得的实测结果。这种具有先进水平的高技术探测设备，填补了我国在这方面的空白，为雷电定位和防范提供了有力的工具。
    专家们认为，这套设备对于航空、电力系统、森林等防范雷电有重要使用价值，性能已达到国际尖端水平。
