	Five Structures That Need Improvement
	Sun Hongguang, Deputy Director of the Industrial Policy Department of the State Planning Commission, and Engineer Li Zhenzhong

	Road transportation is developing rapidly worldwide, but in our country, it is lagging behind. To accelerate the development of road transportation, we need to address several structural issues:

	1. Improve the structure of road and rail transportation. Currently, short-distance passenger and freight transportation, which is suitable for roads, is heavily burdened on the railways, significantly affecting the full utilization of the strengths of both railways and roads. We suggest that the railway department take measures to further divert short-distance passenger and freight traffic to roads and other modes of transportation, leveraging the railways' advantages in long-distance, large-volume, and heavy-duty transportation.

	2. Improve the grade structure of roads. China's roads are of low grade and poor quality, with few roads of grade three or higher. An important task for the future is to upgrade the grade of roads. This is a good, fast, and economical approach. Gradually, we should implement lane driving on major roads.

	3. Address the issue of an irrational composition of vehicle types and low tonnage. The average tonnage of freight vehicles nationwide is only 4.3 tons, which is very uneconomical in operation. In the future, we need to actively adjust the vehicle type structure and develop high-tonnage diesel trucks.

	4. Improve the structure of specialized and social vehicles. The road transportation sector has only 310,000 specialized vehicles, accounting for 6.7% of the total number of civilian vehicles nationwide. One specialized vehicle is equivalent to two social vehicles in terms of utilization rate. To improve vehicle transportation efficiency, we need to increase the proportion of specialized vehicles.

	5. Address the issue of investment structure in road construction. China's road construction funding is limited, with most of it coming from road maintenance fees, making road construction funds very tight. In the future, we need to clearly define the investment scope of the central and local governments and implement a tiered construction and management system. National roads should be built by the state, provincial roads by the provinces, and county roads by the counties. Everyone should work together to make road construction develop faster!

    需要改善五种结构
    国家计委产业政策司副司长　孙鸿光　工程师　李振中
    公路运输在世界上发展很快，但在我国发展较慢。为加快公路运输的发展，我们考虑需要解决几个结构问题：
    一、改善公路与铁路运输结构。目前，宜于公路运输的短途客运货运，大量压在铁路上，增加了铁路的过重负担，严重影响了铁路和公路充分发挥各自的优势。我们建议铁路部门采取措施，进一步把短途客、货流分流到公路等运输方式上来，发挥铁路“长、大、重”的运输优势。
    二、改善公路等级结构。我国公路等级低、质量差，三级以上公路少。今后一个重要任务就是提高公路等级。这是一条好、快、省的路子。同时，逐步地先在干道上实行分道行驶。
    三、改善汽车车种构成不合理、吨位偏低的问题。全国载货汽车的平均吨位只有4.3吨，在营运中很不经济。今后要积极调整汽车车种结构，发展大吨位柴油车。
    四、改善专业与社会车辆的结构。公路运输部门专业运输车辆仅31万辆，占全国民用车辆总数的6.7％，而一辆专业车辆等于两辆社会车辆的利用率。为了提高车辆运输效率，需要增加专业运输车辆的比重。
    五、改善公路建设的投资结构问题。我国公路建设费用少，大部分靠养路费收入，建路资金十分紧张。今后要划清中央、地方的投资范围，实行分级建设、分级管理。国道由国家建，省道由省里建，县道由县里建。大家努力，使公路建设发展的更快一些！
