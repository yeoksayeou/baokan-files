Reporter Lai Renqiong reports: The medical workers of our army have adhered to the direction of serving the grassroots and the officers and soldiers, and have made outstanding achievements in improving the health level of the broad masses of officers and soldiers and the combat effectiveness of the troops.

In the past three years, the entire army has seriously implemented the instructions of the Central Military Commission on strengthening grassroots construction and the principle of prevention first. It has strengthened the construction of grassroots medical units. While preventing and treating diseases, it has actively carried out health propaganda and technical guidance. At present, 80% of the division hospitals and 70% of the regiment medical teams in the entire army have reached the main indicators of the General Logistics Department's "Requirements for Military Health Work." The overall health level of the entire army has been further improved. The health attendance rate of naval and air personnel has reached 97% and 98%, respectively.

Under the premise of ensuring service to the troops, many grassroots medical units in the entire army have opened up to society. This not only alleviates the contradiction of local people having difficulty seeing a doctor but also improves the medical technology level of the troops.

Members of the Central Military Commission, Generals He Haidian and Zhao Nanqi, attended and spoke at the closing of the army's health work conference today.

Minister of the State Health Department Chen Minzhang, Deputy Director of the General Political Department Zhou Keyu, and Deputy Directors of the General Logistics Department Liu Mingpu and Zong Shunli attended the meeting.

　　我军卫生工作成绩突出
    本报北京10月21日讯　记者赖仁琼报道：我军卫生工作者坚持为基层服务、为官兵服务的方向，为提高广大官兵的健康水平和部队战斗力，做出了突出成绩。
    3年来，全军认真贯彻中央军委关于抓基层建设的指示，贯彻预防为主的方针，加强基层卫生单位建设。在防病治病的同时，积极开展卫生宣传、技术指导。目前，全军已有80％的师医院，70％的旅团卫生队，达到总后勤部关于《部队卫生工作要求》的主要指标。全军整体健康水平进一步提高。海、空勤人员的健康出勤率分别达到97％和98％。
    在确保为部队服务的前提下，全军许多基层卫生单位向社会开放。这不仅缓解了地方群众看病难的矛盾，也提高了部队医疗技术水平。
    中央军委委员迟浩田、赵南起上将出席了今天闭幕的全军部队卫生工作会议并讲话。
    国家卫生部部长陈敏章，总政治部副主任周克玉，总后勤部副部长刘明璞、宗顺留出席了会议。
