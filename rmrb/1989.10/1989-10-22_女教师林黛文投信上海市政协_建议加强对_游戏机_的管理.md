Female teacher Lin Daiwen has written to the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, urging for stronger management of "game machines."

"Electronic game machines have become a craze, and due to poor management, they have had some negative effects on middle and primary school students. Relevant departments should strengthen regulation and management." This is the appeal made by Shanghai Municipal People's Congress member and female teacher Lin Daiwen from Tianlin Middle School in a recent letter to the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress.

During the summer vacation, Teacher Lin conducted extensive surveys in the middle and primary schools of Xuhui District. She found that due to lack of guidance and poor management, some middle and primary school students have become obsessed with game machines, affecting their studies and physical and mental health.

For example, a student from Wanping New Village Primary School became addicted to game machines during the winter vacation last year, spending over 100 yuan of his New Year's money. The owner of the game machine, taking advantage of his addiction, encouraged him to keep a tab, and the student then pawned 50 US dollars given by his uncle. Playing game machines took up a lot of his time, and his academic performance was affected. A junior high school student from Tianlin New Village became infatuated with game machines, spending all his pocket money. When he ran out of money, he stole the money his parents used to buy groceries, and even stole 150 yuan from his grandfather's funeral expenses. Later, he forcibly borrowed money from his classmates and stole four floppy disks from the game machine owner to repay his debts. Just before graduation, he sneaked into the Tianlin Hotel attempting to steal, but was caught and failed.

Teacher Lin also discovered that some schools have small game machines in every classroom, and some families own electronic game machines worth 600 to 800 yuan.

In her letter, Teacher Lin Daiwen stated that the craze for electronic game machines has already emerged and cannot be ignored. If not properly constrained and guided, the consequences will be dire. She hopes that schools, parents, and middle and primary school students will be alert to this issue.

　　女教师林黛文投信上海市政协
    建议加强对“游戏机”的管理
    “电子游戏机已出现热潮，由于管理不善，在中小学生中引起了一些不良影响，有关部门应加强整顿管理。”这是上海市政协委员、田林中学女教师林黛文最近给上海市政协写信发出的呼吁。
    暑假期间，林教师对徐汇区中小学做了大量调查，她发现由于引导不力，管理不善，一些中小学生醉心于游戏机，影响了学业和身心健康。
    如：宛平新村一小学生去年寒假时迷上游戏机，将一百多元压岁钱花光。业主利用他贪玩，怂恿他记帐，该生又把舅舅给的五十元美金抵押花光。玩游戏机占据了大量时间，该生学习成绩受到影响。田林新村一名初三学生，贪恋游戏机，零用钱花光了，就偷家长买菜钱，甚至盗窃了祖父的丧葬费用一百五十元。后来，他强行向同学借钱，并盗窃游戏机业主四片磁盘以备还债。临毕业时竟溜进田林宾馆试图行窃，后被发现未得逞。林老师还发现，有的学校每个班级都有一些小型游戏机，有的家庭也有六百—八百元的电子游戏机。
    林黛文老师在信中说，电子游戏机热已经出现，不容忽视，如果不加约束、不善疏导，后果不堪设想。望学校、家长、中小学生能引起警惕。
