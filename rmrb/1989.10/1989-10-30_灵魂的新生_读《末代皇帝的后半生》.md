The life of Puyi, the last emperor of China's Qing Dynasty, is filled with legendary elements. Twenty-five years ago, the book "My Half of Life" (published by Masses Publishing House), which reflected his early experiences, was released and was hailed as a "strange book" by both domestic and international readers. It was translated into English, French, German, Japanese, and other languages, and became a sensation worldwide. In recent years, many domestic and international readers have continuously inquired about Puyi's later life through various means. The book "The Later Half of the Last Emperor's Life," recently published by Masses Publishing House and the People's Liberation Army Publishing House, not only timely supplements "My Half of Life" but also satisfies the eager anticipation of domestic and international readers.

As far as I know, the publication of this book was a laborious process. The first time I heard of the author Jia Yinghua was in 1979 when Masses Publishing House invited me to continue writing about Puyi's later life and conducted an interview. Later, I abandoned the "supplement" plan because I saw that he had already done a lot of material collection work for this topic. It was not until the early spring of 1986 that the editor Wang Lansheng from Masses Publishing House accompanied Yinghua to bring me a 500,000-word manuscript to read, that I knew he had encountered considerable difficulties. The richness and historical value of the materials in this book are evident upon reading.

It is well known that Puyi was an emperor three times in his life, and particularly during the puppet regime of Manchukuo, he became a puppet emperor for Japan, turning into a historical criminal that "everyone in the country said should be killed." However, his later life was not only spared from execution but, on the contrary, experienced a rebirth in the tide of history and enlightenment under the tree of Bodhi, gaining a new soul under the guidance of the Party's reform policy. As recorded in the book, when Premier Zhou received Puyi and others, he said: "Born here, grown here, if not loving this country, then who should one love?" Puyi's heart was shaken! Following this thread and his reform as the main line, the book describes his transformation from a traitor to a citizen with patriotic feelings, and further from a cultural and historical expert to a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, objectively depicting various aspects of his life, including his experiences during the Cultural Revolution.

This book pays great attention to historical facts. For example, when writing about Puyi's interactions with Mao Zedong, the author interviewed more than twenty people. He also visited Shandong twice, sharing meals and sleeping on the same bed with a common farmer, forging a sincere friendship. The farmer friend presented a handwritten letter from Puyi that had been treasured for many years. He searched like a needle in a haystack for the first person Puyi met after being pardoned and arriving in Beijing, as well as the last person who stayed by his side when Puyi passed away. This makes the book possess precious historical value and reliability.

It is worth mentioning that this book not only unearthed some little-known historical materials but also conducted beneficial investigations and verifications on some confusing historical facts in Puyi's early life. For example, what is known to the world is that Puyi's journey from Tianjin to the Northeast was due to a bomb in a basket of flowers sent by the Japanese, which frightened him into fleeing—this was an important step in his descent into the abyss of crime. However, after careful investigation, the author discovered that the basket of flowers was actually sent anonymously by Zhang Xueliang, with the intention of warning Puyi not to rely on the Japanese. Unfortunately, it had the opposite effect, accelerating Puyi's steps to become a Japanese puppet. There are several such mysteries revealed in the book.

If "My Half of Life" mainly depicted Puyi's transformation from a man to a dragon, reflecting the historical process from the late Qing Dynasty to the founding of New China from one side, then "The Later Half of the Last Emperor's Life" reflects a segment of New China's historical development from a specific angle. However, due to avoiding some content related to living individuals, some contradictions in the plot are not fully developed, thus somewhat lacking in depicting Puyi's later life. Additionally, based on being faithful to historical facts, the language characteristics of the characters and the plot development could be further refined. Despite this, whether from the perspective of supplementation or historical and literary value, this book remains a relatively good biographical work.

Mr. Puyi Jie wrote the title for this book and also wrote a preface. In the "Preface," he evaluates the book: "Comprehensive and extensive in collection, fresh and elegant in writing, worthy of admiration."

### 灵魂的新生——读《末代皇帝的后半生》

　　灵魂的新生
　　——读《末代皇帝的后半生》
　　李文达
    中国末代皇帝爱新觉罗·溥仪的一生，极富传奇色彩。25年前，反映他前半生经历的《我的前半生》（群众出版社出版）面世后，遂被海内外公认为一部“奇书”，先后译成英、法、德、日等多国文字，风靡世界。近年来，一些海内外读者不断以各种方式询问溥仪后半生的情况。《末代皇帝的后半生》一书，最近由群众出版社、解放军出版社联合出版发行，不仅适时地续补了《我的前半生》，也恰恰可以一飨引颈企望的海内外读者。
    据我所知，此书问世堪称艰辛。我第一次知道作者贾英华其人是在1979年群众出版社约我续写溥仪后半生而采访之时。后来，我放弃了“续补”的计划，原因就是见到他已为撰写此题材作了许多搜集材料工作。直到1986年初春，群众出版社责编王兰升（亦即《前半生》责编）陪英华送来50万字的书稿让我阅读时，才知他曾遇到过不小的困难。此书材料之翔实丰富，史料价值之高，是阅后便知的。
    众所周知，溥仪一生三次称帝，尤其在伪满充当了日本的傀儡皇帝，成了“国人皆曰可杀”的历史罪人。然而，他的后半生不但未被杀戮，相反却在时代的洪流中经历了绝路逢生和菩提树下的忏悟，在党的改造政策指引下获得了灵魂的新生。正如书中记述周总理接见溥仪等人时所说：“生于斯，长于斯，不爱这个国家爱谁呢？”溥仪的心灵受到了震撼！以此脉络和他的改造为主线，此书描述了他从卖国贼转变为一个具有爱国之心的公民，进而由文史专员到全国政协委员的历史性转变，也客观地刻画了他在“文革”中的遭遇等各个生活侧面。
    此书十分注重史实。仅撰写溥仪与毛泽东交往，作者就采访了二三十人。他还两下山东，和一位普通农民同锅而食，同炕而眠，结下诚挚友谊。农民朋友捧出了珍藏多年的溥仪写给他的亲笔信。他像大海捞针似地寻访了溥仪获赦后抵京第一个谋面的人，乃至溥仪逝世时最终一个守候在他身旁之人。这就使此书具有了珍贵的史料价值和可靠性。
    值得提到的是，此书不仅发掘了一些鲜为人知的史料，也对溥仪前半生中一些扑朔迷离的史实，作了有益的探究和考证。譬如，世人所知的溥仪自津赴东北是被日本人送去花篮里的炸弹吓得赶紧潜往的——这是溥仪走向罪恶深薮的重要一步。而作者经过细致查访后得知，溥仪收到的花篮竟是张学良派人匿名送至，其本意是为了警告溥仪不要投靠日本人，谁想适得其反，却促使溥仪加速了充当日本傀儡的步伐。诸如此类的迷案，书中还有一些披露。
    如果说，《我的前半生》着重描写了溥仪人与龙之间的变化，从一侧面反映了清末到新中国成立前后的这一历史进程，那么，《末代皇帝的后半生》则从一个特定的角度折射了新中国历史的一段发展过程。但此书囿于回避一些与在世之人有关的内容，使有些情节的矛盾未得展开，因而对刻画溥仪的后半生似有欠缺。另外，在忠于史实的基础上，对人物的语言特色和情节的铺垫可再作些精琢。尽管如此，无论从续补的意义上和文史价值上而言，此书仍不失一部比较好的传记作品。
    溥杰先生为此书题写书名并作了序。他在《序》中评价此书：“搜罗博泛，笔墨清新，允叹观止。”
