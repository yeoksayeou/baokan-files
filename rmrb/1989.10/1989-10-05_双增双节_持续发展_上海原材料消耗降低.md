Shanghai's industrial sector, while deeply engaging in the "double increase, double conservation" campaign, has adhered to the city's overall requirement of reducing material consumption by 8% compared to last year. They have spared no effort in conserving raw materials, achieving good results. The consumption of major materials has significantly decreased. Among these, steel consumption has decreased by 7.8%, seven types of non-ferrous metals by 8.5%, cast iron by 10.2%, rubber by 9.1%, and cement by 11.5%.

Shanghai's main methods for promoting "double increase, double conservation" this year are as follows: First, focus on key areas. The Municipal Bureau of Machinery and Electronics has prioritized saving steel, non-ferrous metals, and cast iron, intensively managing 30 key material-consuming enterprises, saving 4,300 tons of steel and 680 tons of non-ferrous metals. The Municipal Bureau of Agricultural Machinery has started with large material-consuming enterprises, saving 3,700 tons of steel. Second, adjust the product structure to save raw materials. The Municipal Bureau of Light Industry has reduced the production of "28" bicycles and increased the production of "26" bicycles by 400,000 units, saving 1,600 tons of steel. After reducing the production of 45,000 oxygen cylinders, 360 tons of steel were saved. Third, improve production processes. The Municipal Bureau of Instruments, which consumes over 8,000 tons of silicon steel sheets annually, has implemented new processes, achieving a silicon steel sheet utilization rate of around 90%, saving 360 tons of silicon steel sheets.

    “双增双节”持续发展
    上海原材料消耗降低
    本报讯　上海市工业部门在深入开展“双增双节”运动中，按照全市将物资消耗比去年下降8％的总要求，千方百计节约原材料，获得较好成绩。主要物资消耗已有较大幅度下降，其中钢材消耗下降7.8％，7种有色金属消耗下降8.5％，铸造生铁消耗下降10.2％，橡胶消耗下降9.1％，水泥消耗下降11.5％。
    上海今年抓“双增双节”的主要办法：一是突出重点。市机电局以节约钢材、有色金属、铸造生铁为重点，狠抓30个重点耗材企业，节省钢材4300多吨、有色金属680余吨。市农机局所属的大小企业从抓耗材大户入手，节省钢材3700多吨。二是调整产品结构，节约原材料。市轻工局减少“28”自行车生产量，增加“26”自行车40万辆，仅此一项就节约钢材1600吨。压缩氧气瓶4.5万只后，减少钢材消耗360吨。三是改进生产工艺。年耗硅钢片8000多吨的大户市仪表局实行新工艺后，硅钢片利用率达到90％左右，节约硅钢片360多吨。
