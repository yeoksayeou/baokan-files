Foreign and domestic tourists visiting Yangzhou can now once again enjoy the famous snacks of the Wei-Yang region.

The Wei-Yang-style snacks, along with the renowned Yangzhou cuisine, have a long history and are famous both at home and abroad. However, due to the difficulty in making some of these snacks and their low profit margins, many of them have long since disappeared from the market. Before the National Day, 13 restaurants and noodle shops of various sizes in the city held a grand exhibition of traditional snacks. Out of the 130 unique pastries on display, experts and representatives of the public selected the top 10 as the best snacks. It was decided that these 10 would be the focus of production, ensuring a steady supply throughout the year.

    扬州恢复传统名点生产
    据新华社南京10月11日电　凡到扬州的中外游客，如今可以重新领略久负盛名的维扬名点了。
    维扬风味小吃与著名的扬帮菜系一样源远流长，驰名中外。但由于有些名点制作困难，利润微薄，在市场上久已绝迹。国庆节前，这个市的13家大小餐馆、饼面店在全市举行了传统风味小吃大汇展。在展出的130种富有特色的点心中，由行家和群众代表优中选优，评出10种为最佳小吃，决定重点生产，保证常年供应。
