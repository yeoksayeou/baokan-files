In October 1988, Hong Kong hosted the 12th Asian Arts Festival. Our country was invited to send the Chinese Uighur "Muqam" Art Troupe. I had the honor of accompanying the troupe and personally witnessed their splendid performance.

On the evening of the 25th, members of the Hong Kong press and arts community arrived early at the convention center, filling every seat, eagerly awaiting the start of the performance.

The orchestra played a lively tune, summoning a group of dancing girls. Their flying braids and graceful figures wafted a fragrant breeze. The audience was unconsciously transported to the oasis of the Gobi Desert, where the grapevines were laden with ripe fruit. Suddenly, the music reached a crescendo, stirring the blood, and the auditorium erupted in thunderous applause. As the performance neared its end, the actors, amidst the high-pitched singing, repeatedly took their bows and gracefully exited the stage. The audience continued to applaud, reluctant to leave. The music started again, and the actors spontaneously danced the Tufan folk dance, Naizikong. The excited audience also stood up to participate, and the venue once again reached a climax.

On the afternoon of the 29th, the Uighur artists went to the platform of the Polytechnic University to participate in the "Silk Road Songs and Dances—Dance Exchange and Celebration" jointly organized by six Hong Kong organizations. More than 400 university students from various schools in Hong Kong, wearing colorful paper Uighur hats, were waiting around the platform.

At the celebration, the young dancer Aibibai's solo dance was graceful and elegant. The male performer Aili's performance was lively and playful, making the audience laugh and chat. A Hong Kong girl performed a Mongolian dance. Although she was petite, her shaking shoulders and arms, and leaping and bounding dance steps, truly depicted the spirit of a grassland heroine. As the celebration reached its climax, the girls and boys eagerly took to the stage, following the performers and dancing the Xinjiang dance...

It was time to teach the songs. The young people quietly looked at the song list. All three were Uighur folk songs that expressed the mutual affection and longing of young men and women, with simple and lovely musical images and melodies rich in national flavor.

"Lift up your veil, dear sister Yalia, your eyebrows are so black, dear sister Yalia..."

"Wow—so beautiful, so lovely!"

The quiet platform was filled only with the echoing songs; the vast campus resonated with the laughter and joy of the youth. The hearts of the students and performers intertwined in the songs...

The "Muqam" troupe's 10-day visit to Hong Kong made us feel the immense charm of China's ethnic minority song and dance art.

    1988年10月，香港举办第12届亚洲艺术节。我国应邀派出中国维吾尔“木卡姆”艺术团前往。我有幸随团，亲眼目睹了艺术团的精彩表演。
    25日晚，来自香港新闻界和文艺界的观众们早早来到大会堂，满场座无虚席，静候开演的铃声。
    乐队奏出的轻快的乐曲，唤出一群翩翩起舞的姑娘。翻飞的长辫、飘逸的身姿漾起阵阵醉人的芬芳。观众不觉被带进戈壁绿洲上那满树青枝绿叶、果熟欲滴的葡萄架下。一忽儿，又把你载到天山脚下的牧场，草正青、羊正肥，天光好灿烂……骤然间，音乐节奏进入高潮，催得人热血沸腾，剧场顿时掌声雷动。演出进入尾声，演员们在男高音歌声中频频谢幕，飘然退场。观众仍旧鼓掌，不肯离去。于是乐声又起，演员们即兴跳起吐鲁番民间那孜空舞，兴奋的观众也纷纷起身参与，场内再度掀起高潮。
    29日下午，维吾尔艺术家们来到理工学院平台，参加由香港6家组织联合举办的“丝路歌舞咏叙——舞蹈交流联欢会”。400多名香港各校的大学生，头戴彩纸做的五颜六色的维族花帽，守候在平台周围。
    联欢会上，青年舞蹈家艾比拜的独舞刚柔有致，轻盈潇洒。男演员艾力的表演生动顽皮，逗得人笑语喧天。一位香港姑娘表演了蒙古舞。虽然她身材娇小，但那抖肩扬臂，奔腾跳跃的舞姿，还真刻划出了几分草原姑娘马上英雄的气势。联欢会进入高潮，姑娘小伙子纷纷上场，跟着演员跳起了新疆舞……
    要教歌了，青年们静下心来看歌单。三首都是维吾尔人民喜闻乐唱的表现青年男女互相爱慕，诉说思念的爱情歌曲，音乐形象质朴可爱，曲调具有浓郁的民族风味。
    “掀起你的盖头来，亲爱的妹妹亚里亚，你的眉毛黑又黑呀，亲爱的妹妹亚里亚……”
    “哇——真美，真好听！”
    静静的平台，只有歌声在缭绕；空旷的校园，回荡着青年们的笑语欢声。学生和演员的心在歌声中交融……
    “木卡姆”团的香港之行虽然只有10天，却使我们感受到我国少数民族歌舞艺术的巨大魅力。
