The unveiling ceremony of the Baolinger Temple Anti-Japanese Armed Uprising Memorial Monument was held today in the ancient town of Baolinger on the grasslands. The ceremony was attended by leaders from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee and the People's Government, as well as some of the old soldiers who participated in and supported the anti-Japanese armed uprising, representatives from various ethnic groups, cadres, and over 3,000 local residents and soldiers from the stationed liberation army. They gathered in front of the majestic monument to pay deep tribute to Ulanfu, the old revolutionary leader of the proletariat who led this armed uprising, and to the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the establishment of New China.

The town of Baolinger, located on the northern grasslands of Ulanqab in the Daqing Mountains, is a strategic stronghold. On February 21, 1936, in the face of the arrogant aggression of Japanese imperialism in Suichuan, Ulanfu, the secretary of the West Mongolian Work Committee of the Communist Party of China, with the heroic spirit of a proletarian revolutionary, led over a thousand patriotic soldiers of the Baolinger Mongolian Political Council Security Corps to carry out an armed uprising. This marked the first shot fired by the Mongolian people in their resistance against Japanese aggression and struggle for national salvation.

The monument stands on the top of the Chaganhaoshan Mountain.

　　百灵庙抗日纪念碑揭幕
    据新华社呼和浩特10月20日电　（记者姜革锋）今天，内蒙古自治区党委和人民政府在草原古镇百灵庙隆重举行百灵庙抗日武装暴动纪念碑揭幕仪式。自治区党政军领导、当年参加和参与抗日武装暴动的部分老战士和各族干部群众、驻地解放军官兵3000多人聚集在雄伟的纪念碑前，深切缅怀领导这次武装暴动的老一辈无产阶级革命家乌兰夫同志以及为中华民族的解放和新中国的建立而壮烈牺牲的革命先烈。
    座落在大青山北乌兰察布草原上的百灵庙镇是兵家必争的要冲。1936年2月21日，面对日本帝国主义侵占绥察的嚣张气焰，中共西蒙工委书记乌兰夫以无产阶级革命家的英雄气概，领导百灵庙蒙政会保安队千余名爱国士兵，毅然举行了武装暴动，打响了蒙古族人民抗日救国第一枪。
    碑矗立在查干哈少山顶。
