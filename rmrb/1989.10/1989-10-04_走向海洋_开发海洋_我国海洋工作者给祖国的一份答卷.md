	Towards the Ocean, Developing the Ocean
	– A Report by China's Ocean Workers to the Motherland
	Wei Xing

	Fifteen years ago, China's ocean workers pledged to Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and other revolutionary elders, as well as to the people of the nation: to survey China's seas, venture into the three great oceans, and set foot on Antarctica. Today, we can proudly say: this pledge has been fulfilled, and we are now advancing towards new goals of comprehensive management and development of the ocean.

	Ocean surveys and scientific research are indispensable preliminary work for the development and utilization of the ocean. Forty years ago, we knew nothing about China's seas, and had to purchase the necessary hydrological and meteorological data from abroad using foreign exchange. In 1958, under the personal care of Premier Zhou, China's ocean workers used wooden ships and motor-sailboats to complete the first national ocean survey.

	Today, China has established a fleet of 62 specialized survey vessels, ranking third in the world. China has not only gained a relatively in-depth understanding of the Chinese continental shelf and central sea areas, providing a basis for scientific development and planning, but has also extended its survey reach to the broad coastal and offshore areas.

	Since 1980, China's ocean workers have conducted comprehensive surveys of the coastal regions of the entire country, understanding the natural environment, resource conditions, and socio-economic situations of these regions. By applying the survey results, they have achieved an efficiency seven times higher than the investment, opening up a new path of comprehensive utilization and diversified operations.

	Currently, a wave of seeking treasures from tidal flats and the ocean has swept across China's coastal regions. It is estimated that by the year 2000, China's coastal regions will increase net land area by 10 million mu, net aquaculture area by 6 million mu, solve employment for 70 million people, and enable 300 million people, who will then account for one-quarter of the national population, to achieve a moderately prosperous life.

	Since the founding of the nation, China's polar exploration has achieved a leap from nothing to something. In 1984, China organized its first Antarctic and Southern Ocean expedition. The expedition members braved storms and cold, endured hardships, and established the first foothold for the Chinese nation in Antarctica – the Great Wall Station. In 1988, China took another big step into the Antarctic Circle, building its second research station with wintering capabilities – the Zhongshan Station. China's polar exploration has gained new understandings of the geology, glaciers, biology, meteorology, geophysics of Antarctica, and the environment of the Southern Ocean, contributing to the peaceful use of Antarctica by all mankind.

	China's ocean science and technology have also achieved remarkable results over the past 40 years. According to incomplete statistics, from 1978 to 1987, a total of 506 scientific and technological achievements at the provincial and ministerial levels (including national level) were awarded. Some projects have reached or approached the world's advanced level, and some are even international firsts. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, a number of key projects, represented by ocean environmental numerical forecasting, marine aviation remote sensing, and water treatment technology, have made breakthrough progress, and some have been applied on a large scale. China's application of aviation remote sensing for temperature measurement to guide fishery production increased the catch by nearly 50,000 tons in the East China Sea from October to December 1986 alone. The domestically produced 200-ton electrodialysis desalination device installed on Yongxing Island in the Xisha Islands is one of the largest desalination devices of its kind in the world.

	China's ocean research has also broken away from the closed state of self-reliance, actively carrying out cooperation with the international ocean community. According to statistics, China has established marine science and technology cooperation and exchange relations with more than 50 countries and regions. Through cooperation, China's ocean workers have expanded their horizons in many new areas of understanding and achieved a number of high-level results.

	China and the United States jointly conducted research on the sea-air interactions in the tropical western Pacific, providing a basis for China's ocean forecasting and long-term weather analysis. China and Canada cooperated to carry out marine ecological enclosure experiments, building one of the few marine pollution dynamics experimental bases in the world.

	Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, in response to the surging tide of ocean development, China's ocean work has undergone a strategic shift, focusing on the comprehensive management of the entire sea area, and making China's ocean development scientific and rational. At present, the scope, degree, types, and sources of pollution in China's sea areas have been basically identified. On this basis, the "National Marine Environmental Pollution Monitoring Network" has been established, equipped with "China Marine Surveillance" vessels and aircraft, strictly managing ship discharges, oil platforms, and marine dumping at sea according to regulations, effectively controlling pollution in key sea areas, and maintaining the environmental quality and ecological balance of the main sea areas in a good state.

	In the process of implementing comprehensive management, China's ocean work departments have also actively carried out public welfare services. The successively established National Marine Forecasting Center, Marine Data Center, Marine Standard Metrology Calibration Center, and Marine Environmental Monitoring Center, like the "Magpie Bridge," closely link marine management with marine production and construction.

	Since 1979, the marine forecasting department has provided tens of thousands of various marine condition forecasts and hundreds of marine disaster condition warnings for rocket launches, distant ocean navigation, oil exploration, marine rescue and salvage, marine surveys, and other marine activities, making important contributions to ensuring the safety of marine activities and the lives and production of coastal residents.

    走向海洋　开发海洋
    ——我国海洋工作者给祖国的一份答卷
    魏星
    15年前，我国海洋工作者对毛泽东、周恩来等老一辈革命家和全国人民立下宏愿：查清中国海，进军三大洋，踏上南极洲。今天，可以自豪地说：这个宏愿实现了，并且正在向综合管理和开发海洋的新目标迈进。
    海洋调查和科学研究是开发利用海洋必不可少的前期工程。40年前，我们对中国海一无所知，所需的水文气象资料要用外汇从国外买回。1958年，在周总理的亲切关怀下，我国海洋工作者使用木船、机帆船完成了第一次全国海洋普查。
    今天，我国已经建立起一支拥有62艘专用调查船只，居世界第三位的调查船队。我国不仅完成了对中国海大陆架和中部海域比较深入的认识，为科学的开发和规划提供了依据，同时还将调查触角伸向沿岸和外海的广阔海域。
    我国海洋工作者从1980年起对全国海岸带地区进行综合调查，摸清了这一地区的自然环境、资源状况和社会经济条件，通过应用调查成果，产生出7倍于投入的高效益，开辟出一条综合利用、多种经营的新路子。
    目前，一个向滩涂要宝、向海洋要宝的热潮已在我国沿海地区掀起。预计到2000年，我国海岸带地区可净增土地面积1000万亩，净增海水养殖面积600万亩，可解决7000万人的就业问题，使占那时全国人口1／4的3亿人口达到小康生活水平。
    建国以来，我国的极地考察事业实现了从无到有的飞跃。1984年，我国组织了首次南极洲和南大洋考察，考察队员战风浪，斗严寒，历尽艰险，建立起中华民族在南极的第一个立足点——长城站。1988年，我国又大踏步跨入南极圈内，建起了第二个具备越冬能力的考察站——中山站。我国的极地考察获得了对南极地质地貌、冰川、生物、气象、地球物理和南大洋环境的新认识，为全人类和平利用南极作出了自己的贡献。
    我国海洋科技工作40年来也取得累累硕果。据不完全统计，仅1978至1987年9年间，就获得省部级以上（含国家级）科技成果奖506项，一些项目已接近或达到世界先进水平，有的还属于国际首创。“七五”期间，以海洋环境数值预报、海洋航空遥感和水处理技术为代表的一大批攻关项目，有的获得突破性进展，有的已经得到大规模应用。我国应用航空遥感测温指导渔业生产，仅1986年10月至12月在东海海区就增产近5万吨鱼。安装在西沙永兴岛上的国产200吨电渗析淡化装置，是目前世界上最大的同类型淡化装置之一。
    我国海洋科研还打破了闭关自守的封闭状态，积极开展与国际海洋界的合作，据统计，我国已与50多个国家和地区建立了海洋科技合作交流关系。通过合作，我国海洋工作者在许多新的认识领域中开拓了眼界，取得了一批水平较高的成果。
    我国与美国共同对热带西太平洋海气相互作用进行研究，为我国海洋预报和分析长期天气形势提供了依据。我国与加拿大合作开展了海洋生态围隔式实验研究，建起世界上为数不多的海洋污染动力学实验基地。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，为了适应日益高涨的海洋开发热潮，我国海洋工作实现了战略转变，把工作重点转向对全海域的综合管理，使我国海洋开发走上科学、合理的轨道。目前已基本查清了我国海域的污染范围、程度、污染物种类分布及污染源，在这个基础上，建起了“全国海洋环境污染监测网”，配备了“中国海监”船只和飞机，按规定对海上船舶排污、石油平台及海洋倾废实施严格管理，使我国重点海域污染得到有效控制，主体水域环境质量、生态平衡保持在良好状态。
    在实施综合管理中，我国海洋工作部门还积极开展公益服务，相继建成的国家海洋预报中心、海洋资料中心、海洋标准计量检定中心和海洋环境监测中心，如同四架“鹊桥”，把海洋管理同海上生产建设紧紧联系起来。
    1979年以来，海洋预报部门为火箭发射、远洋航运、石油开采、海难救助打捞、海洋调查等海上活动提供各类海况预报上万次，灾害性海况警报上百次，为保障海上活动和沿海居民生活生产的安全作出了重要贡献。
