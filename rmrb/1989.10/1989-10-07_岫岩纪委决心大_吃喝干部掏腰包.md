    Xianyan County's Discipline Inspection Commission Takes a Firm Stand: Officials Who Indulge in Feasting Pay Out of Pocket

    Our county is a poor one, yet the practice of extravagant feasting is rampant. On March 2 of this year, the county committee and county government issued a special directive prohibiting the use of public funds for excessive feasting. This directive somewhat curbed the practice, but it did not completely stop it. In early August, the county discipline inspection commission's secretary, Jiaochuanfufu, went to Huanghuadian Town to conduct an investigation. He discovered that the town's enterprises had contributed only 60,000 yuan in profits last year, while the town government had spent nearly 90,000 yuan on feasting and entertaining. From March, when the county issued the directive, to August 3, when the inspection took place, Huanghuadian Town had spent 27,000 yuan on feasting and entertaining. The discipline inspection commission traced the expenditures and identified those responsible, compiling a list of those who had indulged in feasting and stipulating that they would have to pay out of their own pockets. The money collected was turned over to the county's financial department to aid disaster-stricken areas.

    After gaining experience in Huanghuadian Town, the discipline inspection commission immediately began investigating the feasting practices in the townships of Dayingzi, Yanghe, and Pianling. In addition to those from the county who had indulged in feasting while on official business having to pay, local officials who had participated in feasting within their own townships were also fined and required to make restitution. Starting September 1, the county implemented a policy requiring all county officials on business trips to eat in the cafeteria, charging 3 yuan per day for meals. Anyone who exceeded this standard would have to pay out of their own pocket.

    岫岩纪委决心大　吃喝干部掏腰包
    我县是个贫困县，可是吃喝之风盛行。今年3月2日，县委、县政府专门发了禁止用公款大吃大喝的文件，吃喝之风有所收敛，但并没有彻底刹住。8月初，县纪委书记教传福到黄花甸镇蹲点调查，发现这个镇去年镇办企业上交利润只有6万元，而镇政府吃喝招待费竟花掉近9万元。从3月县里发文件查起，到8月3日检查时止，黄花甸镇共花掉吃喝招待费2.7万多元。查账找主，追踪索源，县纪委将吃喝者的名单列出清单，明确规定吃喝者个人掏腰包。县纪委将收上来的钱上交县财政，用于支援灾区。
    县纪委在黄花甸镇取得经验之后，立即着手清查大营子、洋河、偏岭3个乡镇的吃喝问题。除了县里下乡吃喝的人要兑现交钱之外，各乡镇内部参与吃喝的大小头头也要按一定比例罚款、退赔。9月1日，县里已经实行县里下乡的干部一律在食堂就餐，一天要交3元伙食费，超过这个标准吃喝的，谁吃谁掏钱。
