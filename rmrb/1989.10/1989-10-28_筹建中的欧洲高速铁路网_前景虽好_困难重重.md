In Western Europe, people are dreaming of a day in the 21st century when they can have breakfast in London, lunch in Paris, and dinner in Barcelona.

The planned European high-speed railway network will span approximately 26,700 kilometers, with about 7,400 kilometers of new tracks to be laid and 19,000 kilometers of existing tracks to be upgraded. The total cost is estimated to be around $90 billion. By 2015, West Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will be connected by a unified high-speed railway network, with passenger traffic expected to triple. At that time, the journey from Cologne to London will take only 4 hours; from London to Paris, just 3 hours; and from Brussels to Paris, a mere 80 minutes. By 2025, when the entire European high-speed railway network is completed, it will connect Edinburgh in the United Kingdom with Marseille in France and Rome in Italy from north to south, and from west to east, it will more closely link countries like Portugal and Greece on the edges of Europe.

Currently, the European high-speed railway network project is essentially being built by each country according to unified standards, with the European Community responsible for the connecting lines between countries. The United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and Italy are leading this ambitious project. France completed the high-speed railway line from Paris to Lyon in 1981, with a speed of 268 kilometers per hour. This line has already transported 100 million passengers.

To connect the European continent with the British Isles, the United Kingdom and France are collaborating to build the Channel Tunnel, which will pass through the English Channel. The tunnel is scheduled to open on June 15, 1993. High-speed trains will be able to travel at 160 kilometers per hour through the tunnel, paving the way for the smooth operation of the European high-speed railway network. West Germany is building a high-speed railway network within the country with speeds of up to 280 kilometers per hour, which will connect with the European high-speed railway network passing through West Germany. This $10 billion project is expected to be completed by the end of the century. The completion of this ambitious plan will bring new economic and social changes to Europe. However, the specific implementation of this plan still faces many challenges.

The $90 billion required for the construction of the high-speed railway network is a significant burden for each country. Governments have so far refused to establish a substantial European Community transportation fund, and there is no single body responsible for the planning, management, and execution of a common project. This has led to the current situation where each country acts independently based on its own interests. This situation inevitably leads to disputes over issues such as funding use, technical standards, and administrative management when connecting the railway networks between countries.

Additionally, extending the railway line from Italy or Austria to Greece will necessarily pass through Yugoslavia, which requires joint efforts from relevant European countries.

### 筹建中的欧洲高速铁路网  前景虽好　困难重重

　　筹建中的欧洲高速铁路网
　　前景虽好　困难重重
　　董健
    在西欧，人们憧憬着21世纪初的某一天，实现能在伦敦用早点，在巴黎用午餐，晚饭则在巴塞罗那的前景。
    建设中的欧洲高速铁路网计划全长约26700公里，其中要铺设约7400公里新轨道，需改进约19000公里陈旧轨道，全部费用预计达900亿美元。到2015年，西德、英国、法国、荷兰、比利时和卢森堡将由统一技术规格的高速铁路网络相联，列车运输量将比现在增长3倍。届时，从科隆到伦敦，只需4个小时；从伦敦到巴黎只要3个小时，而从比利时首都布鲁塞尔到法国首都巴黎只有80分钟的路程。待到2025年，欧洲高速铁路网全部工程完成时，它将英国爱丁堡与法国马赛、意大利罗马从北至南连接，由西到东将把葡萄牙和希腊等地处欧洲边缘的国家更密切地连接起来。
    目前的欧洲高速铁路网工程，实际上是由各国根据统一规格各自修建，欧共体负责修建各国之间的连线。英国、法国、西德和意大利在这一宏大的工程计划中走在前列。法国早于1981年就建成巴黎至里昂时速为268公里的“高速列车”线路，该线目前已运送了旅客1亿人次。
    为沟通欧洲大陆与不列颠群岛的高速铁路干线，英国正与法国合作开辟从伦敦至巴黎途中所必经之路——英吉利海峡英法海底隧道。预计该隧道于1993年6月15日开通使用。届时，高速列车可在隧道内以160公里的时速行驶，从而为欧洲高速铁路网的畅通铺平了道路。西德正在国内兴建时速280公里的城市间快速列车铁路网，以待与穿过西德的欧洲高速铁路网干线相联，这项耗资100亿美元的工程预计于本世纪末完成。该项宏大计划的完成，将为欧洲带来新的经济和社会变革。然而，该计划的具体实现，仍面临重重困难。
    建设高速铁路网所需的900亿美元的庞大经费就令各国所头痛。各国政府至今一直拒绝建立一笔雄厚的欧洲共同体运输基金，更没有一个对共同的计划负责和管理执行的机构，而导致目前各自以本国为基础采取行动的现状。这一现状又势必在各国间进行铁路网络连接时引起诸如经费使用、技术规格及行政管理权等许多问题的争端。
    另外，铁路线从意大利或奥地利延伸通往希腊就必途经南斯拉夫境内，尚有待欧洲有关国家共同做出努力。
