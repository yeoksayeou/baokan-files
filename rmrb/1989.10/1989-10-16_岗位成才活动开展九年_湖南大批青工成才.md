The on-the-job excellence campaign for young workers in Hunan has been ongoing for nine years, achieving remarkable results. Over 28,000 outstanding talents have emerged from various positions, directly creating economic value and savings for enterprises amounting to 1.83 billion yuan.

Since 1981, the Communist Youth League of Hunan Province, in collaboration with relevant departments, has organized young workers across the province to participate in the on-the-job excellence campaign. This campaign aims to educate, guide, and assist young workers in combining the realization of communism with the performance of their duties. The slogan "Ideals shine on the job," "Youth burns in creation," and "Wisdom bears fruit in labor" has become the rallying cry and conscious action for the 3 million young workers in the province.

During the on-the-job excellence campaign, young workers have embraced the grand ideal of communism and striven to learn knowledge and skills. Over the past nine years, the province has seen the emergence of 18,000 youth science and technology associations, 2,100 youth worker science reading groups, and 70 youth technical schools. A total of 37,000 training sessions have been organized, training over 1.4 million young workers. Various technical competitions and excellence contests have been held over 200,000 times.

In the on-the-job excellence campaign, young workers in Hunan have extensively carried out activities centered around "five smalls": small inventions, small innovations, small modifications, small designs, and small suggestions. Over the past nine years, 500,000 young workers have created over 200,000 "five smalls" achievements. To date, 110,000 of these "five smalls" achievements have been promoted and applied, directly creating economic value amounting to 1.09 billion yuan.

Additionally, young workers have actively contributed to enterprise innovation and potential exploration, establishing numerous technical research and development teams. These efforts have resulted in 740 million yuan in increased revenue and savings for enterprises.
