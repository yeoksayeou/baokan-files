The Summit of American Heads of State concluded this afternoon at the "Plaza of Democracy" in San José, the capital of Costa Rica.

The meeting proceeded according to the scheduled program, with the heads of state engaging in private discussions, free speeches, and exchanges of views on the democratic process in the Western Hemisphere, debt and development, drug eradication, and peace in Central America. However, no in-depth discussions or attempts to reach a consensus were held, and no communiqué or similar document was issued. The two-day Summit of American Heads of State was declared concluded at the inaugural ceremony of the mass rally at the "Plaza of Democracy."

Costa Rican President Arias called on the countries of the Western Hemisphere to work together to promote democracy and development, reduce debt, eradicate drugs, protect the environment, and accelerate disarmament.

This morning, U.S. President Bush had breakfast with Panamanian opposition leader Endara and Nicaraguan opposition presidential candidate Charmo, along with the presidents of Argentina, Honduras, and El Salvador. He reiterated that the United States believes Endara won the Panamanian elections and expressed full support for Charmo's participation in Nicaragua's presidential elections next February. Bush stated that Panama and Nicaragua have no reason to be exceptions to the democratic process on this continent. In a later press conference, Bush repeatedly criticized Ortega for not fulfilling his obligations under the Central American Peace Agreement.

Meanwhile, President Ortega announced at a press conference this morning that the Nicaraguan government will stop implementing the unilateral ceasefire. He said that due to the continuous provocations and attacks by the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces, since the Nicaraguan government unilaterally implemented the ceasefire on March 24 last year, Nicaragua has suffered 3,370 deaths, injuries, kidnappings, or missing persons at the hands of the anti-government armed forces. Last week, in a conflict with the anti-government armed forces in the north, 18 government soldiers were killed. The repatriation of the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces has made little progress; Nicaragua is still bleeding and paying the price; the provocations and attacks by the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces have affected and are interfering with the political process of the upcoming elections. Therefore, he announced that the Nicaraguan government will stop implementing the unilateral ceasefire. He also condemned the United States for funding the Nicaraguan anti-government armed forces and interfering with the scheduled national elections in Nicaragua next February.

On October 28, Nicaraguan President Ortega, who was attending the Summit of American Heads of State, held a press conference in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, announcing the suspension of the unilateral ceasefire by the Nicaraguan government against the anti-government armed forces.

　　美洲国家首脑会议结束
　　奥尔特加宣布尼政府将停止单方面停火
　　布什公然支持巴拿马与尼加拉瓜反对派
    本报圣何塞10月28日电  记者郭伟成报道：美洲国家首脑会议今天午间在哥斯达黎加首都圣何塞市内的“民主广场”结束。
    会议按预定的程序，由首脑们进行私下会晤、自由发言与交谈，对西半球民主进程、债务与发展、禁毒、中美洲和平等问题发表意见，但是没有展开讨论或试图达成一致；会议也没有发表任何公报或类似文件。为时两天的美洲国家首脑会议，在“民主广场”的揭幕式群众集会上宣布结束。
    哥斯达黎加总统阿里亚斯在会上呼吁西半球各国共同努力，推进民主与发展，减轻债务，摧毁毒品，保护生态，加速裁军。
    美国总统布什今天早晨在下榻的旅馆里与巴拿马反对派领导人恩达拉及尼加拉瓜反对党总统候选人查莫罗夫人，阿根廷、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多总统共进早餐，重申美国认为恩达拉已在巴拿马大选中获胜；并表示全力支持查莫罗夫人参与尼加拉瓜明年2月的大选。布什说，巴拿马与尼加拉瓜没有理由成为本大陆民主进程中的例外。在后来的记者招待会上，布什竟一再批评奥尔特加没有履行中美洲和平协定的义务。
    与此同时，奥尔特加总统在今晨记者招待会上宣布，尼加拉瓜政府将停止实施单方面停火。他说，由于尼加拉瓜反政府武装不断挑起事端，发动袭击，自从去年3月24日尼加拉瓜政府单方面实施停火以来，尼加拉瓜已经死亡、负伤，被反政府武装绑架或失踪者共达3370人；上周在北部与反政府武装的冲突中，政府军18人死亡。对尼加拉瓜反政府武装的遣返至今进展甚微；尼加拉瓜还在流血，付出代价；尼加拉瓜反政府武装的挑衅、袭击已经影响并正在干扰大选的政治进程，为此，他宣布，尼政府将停止实施单方面停火。他还谴责美国资助尼反政府武装，干扰预定在明年2月举行的尼全国大选。（附图片）
