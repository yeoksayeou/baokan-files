    Happiness Arrives in Happiness Village

    In the 40 years since liberation, Yantai's Zhifu District's Happiness Town has undergone tremendous changes. Last year, the town's total industrial and agricultural income reached 150 million yuan, with villagers' per capita savings amounting to 2,200 yuan. Formerly, farmers lived in shacks (see bottom right photo); now, villagers' houses stand in neat rows. The photo shows the new homes of farmers in Happiness Village Eleven.
