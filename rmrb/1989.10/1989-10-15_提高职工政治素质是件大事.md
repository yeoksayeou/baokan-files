The experience of Yangzhou Silk Mill in running a political school for eight years is worth noting. Their practice shows that to ensure an enterprise adheres to the correct socialist direction and maintains continuous production development, it is crucial to cultivate a team that is politically and technically competent. With such a team, the enterprise can withstand difficulties and storms, remain vibrant, and make continuous contributions to the construction of both material and spiritual civilization.

The workers' political school is a creation of the workers, a good form of systematic political and ideological education for the broad masses of workers, and an important front for ideological and political work. In recent years, many enterprises have established various types of political schools with good results. However, there are still doubts about whether these schools are necessary, feasible, and effective. The eight-year experience of Yangzhou Silk Mill in running a political school has provided a good answer to these questions. Their experience is successful.

Improving the quality of workers, especially their political quality, is a major task. This is because, in the new situation of reform and opening up, we will encounter many new contradictions and problems. Helping workers correctly understand and handle these problems and contradictions requires strong ideological and political work to guide them. Especially with the opening to the outside world, various imported goods are flooding in, and it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad. Some decadent bourgeois ideas are resurfacing. The influence and corrupting effects of these decadent ideas and erroneous trends on some workers cannot be underestimated. Therefore, we must continuously educate workers on Marxist basic theory and the party's basic line for the current stage, so that the broad masses of workers can build a long wall in their minds to resist corruption. This is an important link in ensuring that the enterprise's reform and opening up proceed along the socialist path.

Our enterprises are socialist enterprises. They not only need to produce more and better material products but also cultivate a new generation of people who are "idealistic, moral, cultured, and disciplined." Socialist enterprises must certainly instill socialist ideas in workers, and running various political schools is an important and effective way to do this. Through various political schools, workers, especially young people, can establish a correct worldview and outlook on life, enhance their political awareness of loving the factory and the country, and thus mobilize their enthusiasm, creativity, and labor passion to strive hard and achieve great things for the socialist modernization of the country.

The valuable aspect of Yangzhou Silk Mill's experience in running schools is that they have recognized that the workers' political school is a good way to systematically educate workers, so they have persisted and improved it to meet the needs of the new situation. This political school for workers has gone through eight years of ups and downs and has persisted even in the face of great difficulties in ideological and political work. This is not easy. It shows that the enterprise leadership has a strong sense of political responsibility and dedication, and they are good at starting from reality, according to the characteristics of the new situation and the needs of the masses of workers, exploring and creating effective forms of ideological and political work. Practice has proven that as long as the direction is clear and the approach is correct, ideological and political work can be very attractive. There is much that can be done in this regard.

The experience of Yangzhou Silk Mill is worth learning from and promoting. We believe that as long as we fully recognize the importance of improving workers' political qualities, treat this work as a major task, and persist in it, other enterprises and units can certainly create more and better experiences, making ideological and political work truly effective and improved. The good tradition of our party's ideological and political work will certainly shine with new luster in the new historical period.

    提高职工政治素质是件大事
    本报评论员
    扬州纱厂坚持8年办政治学校的经验值得重视。他们的实践说明，企业要坚持社会主义的正确方向，要保持生产的不断发展，很重要的一点在于要培养一支在政治思想上、业务技术上过得硬的队伍。有了这样一支队伍，企业就能够经得起困难和风浪的考验，充满活力，蓬勃发展，在两个文明建设中不断作出新贡献。
    职工政治学校是职工的创造，是对广大职工进行系统政治思想教育的一种好形式，也是思想政治工作的一个重要阵地。这些年，一些企业相继办起了各种不同类型的政治学校，效果是好的。但是，在这个问题上确存在着“要不要，行不行，灵不灵”的看法。扬州纱厂坚持8年办学的实践很好地回答了这个问题。他们的经验是成功的。
    提高职工的素质尤其是政治素质是一件大事。这是因为，我们现在是在改革开放的新形势下搞现代化建设，会有许多新矛盾、新问题出现。帮助职工正确地认识这些问题、处理这些矛盾，需要强有力的思想政治工作加以引导。特别是由于对外开放，各种舶来品纷至沓来、良莠不辨，一些资产阶级的腐朽思想沉渣泛起。这些腐朽思想和错误思潮对一些职工的影响乃至腐蚀作用是不可低估的。这就需要我们不断地向职工进行马克思主义基本理论和党在现阶段基本路线教育，使广大职工在思想上筑起反腐蚀的长城。这是保证企业的改革开放始终沿着社会主义道路前进的重要一环。
    我们的企业是社会主义企业，它不仅要生产更多更好的物质产品，也要培养“有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律”的一代新人。社会主义企业当然要向职工灌输社会主义思想，而开办各类政治学校正是灌输社会主义思想的重要和有效途径之一。通过各类政治学校培养，使职工尤其是青年树立起正确的世界观和人生观，提高他们爱厂爱国的政治觉悟，从而调动他们的积极性、创造性和劳动热情，为国家的社会主义现代化建设艰苦奋斗，建功立业。
    扬州纱厂办学经验的可贵之处在于，他们认准了职工政治学校是对职工进行系统教育的好办法，就坚持干下去，并在坚持中不断改进，以适应新形势的需要。这个职工政治学校经历了风风雨雨的8年，在思想政治工作十分困难的情况下都坚持下来，是很不容易的。这既表现了企业领导具有很强的政治责任感和事业心，也说明他们善于从实际出发，根据新形势的特点和职工群众的要求，摸索、创造行之有效的思想政治工作形式。实践证明，只要方向明、路子对，思想政治工作是完全可以吸引人的。在这方面是大有可为的。
    扬州纱厂的经验是值得学习和推广的。我们相信，只要充分认识提高职工政治素质的重要性，把这个工作当作一件大事来抓，常抓不懈，其它的企业和单位完全可以创造出更多更好的经验，使思想政治工作得到切实有效的加强和改进。我们党的思想政治工作的好传统，一定会在新的历史时期焕发出新的光彩。
