Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th.

The Ministry of Supervision's Minister, Yu Jianrong, today proposed that supervision agencies should, in the coming period, continue to prioritize the investigation of major and significant cases. They should break through a batch of high-impact cases that have national or regional influence, serving as a deterrent and boosting the confidence and resolve of the broad masses of cadres and people in their fight against corruption.

Yu Jianrong said that in investigating and dealing with cases of law and discipline violations, supervision agencies should focus on the following three points: First, they should firmly grasp cases where leading cadres use their power to engage in various forms of power-for-money exchanges to illegally gain benefits; second, they should investigate a batch of cases that have drawn strong public outcry, such as leading cadres using public funds for extravagant banquets, using their power to build private homes, using public funds for high-standard home renovations, and "official profiteering"; third, they should, based on the characteristics and advantages of supervision agencies, start from strengthening law enforcement supervision, and focus on investigating those serious cases of law and discipline violations where orders are not followed, prohibitions are not heeded, and local interests are pursued at the expense of overall interests, thus interfering with the implementation of the policies for rectification and order.

Yu Jianrong said that while seriously investigating and dealing with cases, supervision agencies will vigorously carry out anti-corruption and clean governance propaganda and education, organically combining punishment with preventive education, and treating both the symptoms and the root causes. Using various examples, they will vigorously promote education on the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, as well as education on carrying forward the spirit of hard work and struggle, strengthening the overall situation awareness, and upholding discipline.

　　继续查办大案　做到惩一儆百
    新华社北京10月25日电　监察部部长尉健行今天提出，监察机关今后一个时期，要继续把查办大案要案放到重要位置上，分别突破一批有分量的，对全国或一个地区、部门有影响的案件，既起到惩一儆百的作用，又能够增强和鼓舞广大干部、群众反对腐败的信心和斗志。
    尉健行说，监察机关查处违法违纪案件，当前要着眼于以下三点：一是要紧紧抓住一些领导干部利用职权采取各种方式搞权钱交易谋取非法利益的案件；二是要查处一批群众反映强烈的案件，如领导干部用公款大吃大喝，利用职权营建私房，用公款高标准装修住房以及“官倒”等等；三是要从监察机关的特点和优势出发，从加强执法监察着手，着重查处那些有令不行、有禁不止，为了局部利益不惜牺牲整体利益，干扰治理、整顿方针的贯彻执行的严重违法违纪案件。
    尉健行说，在严肃查处案件的同时，监察机关将大力开展拒腐倡廉的宣传教育，把惩治与防范教育、治本与治标有机地结合起来。利用各种事例，大力进行全心全意为人民服务的根本宗旨的教育，以及发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，加强全局观念，严肃纪律的各种教育。
