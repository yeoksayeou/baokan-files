The state has directly invested nearly 900 million yuan in three key projects currently under construction in Tibet. Among these, 200 million yuan has been allocated to the expansion of Gonggar Airport, 600 million yuan to the Yangzhuoyong Lake Hydropower Station, and 80 million yuan to the development of the Lubusha Chromite Iron Mine.

The expansion project of Gonggar Airport, which began in March this year, has completed 67% of the earthwork for the runway. It is expected to finish the construction of the main runway by next year. The new runway will be 4,000 meters long and 60 meters wide, capable of accommodating Boeing 747 aircraft.

The first phase of the Yangzhuoyong Lake Hydropower Station started construction in September this year. Currently, the 38-kilometer internal road and external communication lines of the power station are basically operational, and 3,000 square meters of land have been leveled. The high-voltage transmission line from Lhasa to the Yangzhuoyong Lake Power Station is also being urgently constructed.

On October 25, Mao Rupai, Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Government, visited the Yangzhuoyong Lake Power Station project and commented that this project will set four world records in engineering construction: large-scale earthwork construction at an altitude of 4,500 meters, using a natural lake as a reservoir for a pumped storage power station, excavating a 6-kilometer tunnel at an altitude above 4,500 meters, and a water drop of over 840 meters.

According to the reporter, the Yangzhuoyong Lake Power Station project uses water from the Yarlung Zangbo River to regulate the lake water, generating electricity while protecting the natural ecological balance of the lake area.

The completion of these large-scale construction projects will bring significant economic benefits to Tibet.

　　国家直接投资近九亿元
　　支持西藏经济社会发展
    本报拉萨10月30日电  记者刘伟报道：最近，国家直接投资近9亿元人民币，用于西藏正在建设中的三项重点工程。其中，向贡嘎机场扩建工程投资2亿元，向羊卓雍湖电站工程投资6亿元，向罗布莎铬铁矿开发投资8000万元。
    今年3月破土动工的贡嘎机场扩建工程，目前场道土方工程已完成67％，明年可望完成主跑道建设。新建的跑道长4000米，宽60米，可起降波音747型客机。
    羊卓雍湖电站一期工程在今年9月动工。目前，电站38公里场内公路及场外通信基本畅通，已平场地3000平方米。拉萨至羊湖电站的高压输电线也在紧张架设中。
    西藏自治区政府副主席毛如柏10月25日考察羊湖电站工程时评介说，该工程将在世界和我国工程建设史上创造4个纪录：在海拔4500米高度进行大规模土方工程建设，用天然湖泊作水库进行蓄能电站建设，在海拔4500米以上地段打6公里长隧洞，水的落差达840多米。
    据记者了解，羊湖电站工程采用提取雅鲁藏布江水调节湖水，蓄水发电，湖区自然生态平衡可得保护。
    这些大型建设工程完成后，将给西藏带来巨大经济效益。
