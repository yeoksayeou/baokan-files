	The CPC Central Committee today received a letter from Comrade Huang Van Hoan congratulating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	The letter said, over the past 40 years, the hardworking and brave Chinese people have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, overcoming numerous difficulties, and turning a poor and backward China into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced science and culture. In particular, over the past decade, China has adhered to the policy of reform and opening up, achieving tremendous accomplishments that have won the admiration and praise of the whole world.

	China's brilliant achievements have made significant contributions to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, greatly inspiring the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Since its founding, China has consistently pursued an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and resolutely fought for peace in Asia and the world. China's role and status in the international arena have been steadily rising.

	The letter said, in June this year, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government decisively and resolutely suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subverting the socialist system, which was instigated by imperialism in an attempt to achieve a peaceful evolution in China. Through this severe test, the leadership of the Communist Party of China has been strengthened, and the socialist system in China has been further consolidated. I am deeply convinced that a prosperous and thriving socialist China will forever stand firmly in the world.

	The letter said, in the long-term struggle against imperialist aggression and in the cause of socialist construction, the Vietnamese people have received the full support and selfless, comprehensive, and substantial assistance from the Chinese government and people. The Vietnamese people will never forget this.

    黄文欢同志致函中共中央
    热烈祝贺我国庆四十周年
    新华社北京9月29日电　中国共产党中央委员会今天收到黄文欢同志发来的热烈祝贺中华人民共和国成立40周年的贺信。
    贺信说，40年来，勤劳勇敢的中国人民发扬自力更生、奋发图强的精神，克服了种种困难，把一个贫穷落后的中国建设成为一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和先进科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。特别是十几年来中国坚持改革开放政策，取得了为全世界所钦佩和赞赏的巨大成就。
    中国的辉煌成就，对保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了重大贡献，极大地鼓舞了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。建国以来，中国始终如一地奉行和平友好，独立自主的外交政策，坚决为亚洲和世界的和平而斗争。中国在国际上的作用和地位日益提高。
    贺信说，今年6月，中国共产党和中国政府坚决果断地平息了帝国主义妄图在中国实现和平演变阴谋而掀起的旨在推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义制度的反革命暴乱。经过这场严峻的考验，中国共产党的领导力量得到了加强，中国社会主义制度更加巩固了。我深信，一个繁荣昌盛的社会主义中国将永远巍然屹立在世界上。
    贺信说，越南人民在长期抗击帝国主义侵略的斗争以及在社会主义建设事业中，曾得到中国政府和中国人民的全力支持和慷慨无私、全面巨大的援助。越南人民对此将永志不忘。
