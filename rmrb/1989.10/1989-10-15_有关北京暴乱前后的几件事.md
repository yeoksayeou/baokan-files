The causes and processes of the Beijing turmoil in early June are intricate and complex. Without a calm and rational analysis, it is difficult to fully understand the origins and developments. Unfortunately, some "human rights and democracy fighters" outside China, as soon as the student movement began in Beijing, reacted with a "hysterical" mindset, making a series of impulsive and blind responses. They either intentionally or unintentionally played a role in fanning the flames and isolating China internationally.

Due to space limitations, this article cannot delve into the internal causes of the Beijing turmoil (such as the loss of macro-control over reform and opening up, leading to various problems, corruption and bribery, the lack of adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles, and the neglect of ideological and patriotic education for the younger generation). It can only briefly analyze some facts of "internal and external coordination" before and after the turmoil, hoping that overseas Chinese will be more vigilant after understanding these facts.

(1) Anti-Socialist Cheerleaders

Some overseas Chinese, as soon as the student movement began in Beijing, without investigating the facts, hysterically issued statements, held demonstrations, shouted for the overthrow of the Li Peng government, begged foreign governments to sanction China and sever all cooperation, funded Chinese students and scholars in Canada to betray their motherland, causing China to suffer severe brain drain. In short, these people, under the guise of "human rights and democracy," did their best to attack and defame China's international image and prestige, aiming to isolate China and overthrow its current government. This perfectly aligned with the goals of the "elite" who planned the Beijing turmoil.

At the same time, these "human rights and democracy" supporters, along with those who, with the help of anti-China socialist organizations and individuals from abroad, escaped to foreign countries through "underground channels," formed a united front with the so-called "elite" of the student and democratic movements. They would suddenly go to Chicago for a "national conference," then to Paris for a "founding conference," then a "national mourning day" march, then a "hundred-day memorial." They sang in unison, forming an international cheerleading squad against the Chinese government and socialism, always shouting "global Chinese people united in supporting" their "condemnation of the Chinese government's atrocities."

Have these people investigated? Do global Chinese people really support them? Most overseas Chinese media are the mouthpieces of the cheerleading squad. These media claim to be the guardians of "truth" and "friends of democracy and freedom," but in reality, they suppress any dissenting opinions, resulting in only anti-Chinese government statements being seen in these media. No wonder the cheerleading squad is proud to think they have the support of "global Chinese people." But do they know that in Singapore and Malaysia, where Chinese people reside, there are no such hysterical reactions and activities? Many readers of the Singapore United Daily believe that the Li Peng government is enlightened and progressive, while the students' actions are more "radical," "not knowing when to stop, step by step, unwilling to retreat, leading to a bloody outcome."

(2) Internal and External Coordination

As early as last year, Hong Kong's Chinese media and "scholars and writers" began to create the "overthrow Deng, protect Zhao" public opinion. On one hand, they criticized Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng for the economic mistakes of the past few years. On the other hand, they praised Zhao Ziyang as a rare talent, open-minded, and if he were to implement a "strongman politics" dictatorship, China's reform and opening up would have a future. This rhetoric perfectly aligned with the opinions of the "elite" who instigated the student movement and turmoil in China.

During the same period, the "Federal Alliance" and "Spring of China" in exile in the United States specially sent people to Shanghai to cause trouble for the so-called "Yang Wei incident," followed by scholars and some Nobel laureates in North America, Western Europe, and Hong Kong signing petitions, demanding that China "respect human rights" and release Wei Jingsheng and other political prisoners. At the same time, some people in Hong Kong launched a citizen signature campaign and sent a delegation to Beijing to petition the National People's Congress, proposing the same demand to release Wei Jingsheng and others.

In China, during the same period, some students at Peking University were busy organizing so-called "democracy salons," specially inviting foreigners and domestic "democracy fighters" to attack the Four Cardinal Principles and "conservatives" with various speeches.

Last summer, the television documentary "River Elegy" appeared in China, completely denying the contributions and value of Chinese civilization, and fully accepting the "blue ocean culture" of the West. This is the popular version of the "complete Westernization" theory and is also a link in creating public opinion for the turmoil.

Some Chinese intellectuals who yearn to "go to the world" also held so-called "big, medium, and small" (depending on status) "foreign salons" with diplomats, scholars, and journalists stationed in China, using their relationships with foreigners as a pathway to "go to the world." As a result, the main "elites" almost every month (or even every week) had foreigners or organizations inviting them to "meetings," "lectures," or to receive "human rights" or "democracy" awards or certificates. Liu Xiaobo, who had just completed his doctoral course at Renmin University, immediately transformed into an internationally famous "black horse of literature," immediately invited to Europe and America to "lecture."

Does China not have scholars with higher academic status and achievements than Liu Xiaobo? Of course, it does, but they are unwilling to engage in defaming the Chinese government and socialism to become pets of foreigners, so they have fewer opportunities to be invited abroad to lecture.

A high point of "internal and external coordination" occurred at the end of March this year. At that time, during the farewell banquet for U.S. President Bush's visit to Beijing, he privately invited Fang Lizhi to the banquet using unrecognized diplomatic procedures. However, since Fang's name was not on the guest list given by the U.S. side to China, he was refused entry to the banquet hall according to diplomatic etiquette and for the safety of the state guest. However, because the person refused was a darling of international anti-socialists, international public opinion immediately criticized the Chinese side for being unreasonable, and overseas Chinese media shouted even louder, "Fang Lizhi was humiliated," "China lost its national dignity," demanding that the Chinese side apologize to Fang and Bush, completely reversing right and wrong.

Those who watched the TV that day could see that Fang Lizhi was always standing with the Americans, and when he met with reporters, he was accompanied by Americans as consultants, with an air of "Americans are by my side, who dares to touch me." Any self-respecting Chinese person who saw this would feel disgusted.

(3) Media Stirring Up Trouble

Some overseas Chinese media have fully exaggerated and added fuel to the fire regarding the above "internal and external coordination" events. After the student movement began in Beijing, these media reported or published any rumors that could defame the Chinese government without restraint. Many rumors that were not facts were reported as front-page news.

Just take the headlines of Chinese newspapers that could be seen in multiple cities on June 4th as an example. The degree to which each headline about the Beijing suppression of the turmoil deviated from the facts was shocking. The headline of a major Chinese newspaper in North America that day read: "Beijing Massacre, Corpses Piled Up, Ten Thousand Injured and Killed." In fact, even Wu'er Kaixi's own estimate in Chicago was only 3,000 deaths (his initial estimate in Paris was 2,000 deaths), and more than 10,000 injured. However, Nicholas Kristof, a New York Times reporter stationed in Beijing, disagreed with the above death toll. After investigating hospitals in the Beijing area and interviewing reporters and students stationed in Beijing, his conclusion was that the number of people killed in the suppression of the turmoil on June 3rd and 4th was between 400 and 800 (see the June 22nd edition of the Star newspaper in multiple cities this year). The official Chinese figure is more than 300 deaths. In terms of the number of deaths, the Chinese official figure is obviously closer to the New York Times estimate.

Before and after the Beijing turmoil, most overseas Chinese media reported on the Chinese situation, with 9 out of 10 reports being either rumors or distorted or exaggerated. Deng Xiaoping died, Deng Yingchao wanted to tear up her party membership card, the People's Liberation Army was about to have an internal war, etc., alarmist rhetoric abounded.

The above reports were later proven to be fabricated rumors. Strangely, these self-proclaimed "truth-tellers" media had no sense of responsibility as journalists, misleading readers and the public, but not even a "correction" or an apology. More interestingly, those self-proclaimed "human rights and democracy fighters" did not look at or read any analysis and explanation of the suppression of the turmoil by the Chinese government, but immediately labeled it as false and deceitful. On the other hand, they treated the endless falsehoods and lies in the media as treasures, eagerly spreading these falsehoods and lies to China. As a result, these untruthful reports and rumors were accepted as facts by some people in China, playing a role in misleading and adding fuel to the fire for anti-government activities.

(4) Whose "Democracy and Freedom"

Some people call the students and citizens who participated in the Beijing march, hunger strike, and resistance to the martial law "patriotic," and also say that their demands are "progressive." Undoubtedly, there are indeed patriotic and progressive people among these people. However, the "human rights and democracy fighters" who planned this anti-government action and some members of the so-called think tanks, as well as the student leaders who served as spokesmen for this action and claimed to be "elite," cannot be said to be patriotic and progressive from any angle.

These people want China to fully implement capitalism, thinking that this will bring wealth to the majority of Chinese people. This is a naive dream. Today, capitalism has become international, and it can no longer be limited to one country. Most people in the West have improved their lives, but this wealth comes at the expense of maintaining the long-term poverty of the majority of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. If the exchange between rich and poor countries in the international capitalist system is equal, how can this situation occur?

If China wants to become another capitalist country, it must compete with existing capitalist countries to gain the right to exploit other countries. However, this is impossible. The places in the world that can be exploited have already been occupied by others, and even if there are some leftovers, the existing capitalist countries will not let China seize them. In this situation, if China wants to develop capitalism, the only way is to accept the development of being a comprador capitalist country that is neither a colony nor a capitalist country. At that time, the Chinese people will return to the era of warlords. Can those who advocate for such a China be said to be "patriotic" and progressive? In fact, after ten years of reform and opening up, China has already tasted some capitalist development, but it has also brought about inflation, corruption, the decline of rural medical and health care, the retrogression of women's status in society, and environmental pollution and destruction. These are not enough to alert people?

The democracy these people demand is Western-style, but do they know that the democratic political structure in the West appeared in the guise of "icing on the cake" only after the foundation of a free market economy was established? There was no democracy during the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe. In fact, women in Britain did not obtain the right to vote until after 1920, while women in Quebec, Canada, had to wait until 1940 to vote.

As for freedom, the "freedom" these "elites" want is nothing more than the freedom to become "elites." In fact, Chinese university students are already the darlings of heaven, more "elite" than Canadian university students. Just ask how many university students there are among China's 11 billion people, and you will know their superior position. Han Suyin said that these university students are afraid to soil their hands, opposing being sent down to the countryside, with no spirit of serving the masses. They want the freedom to rise to prominence, the freedom to go abroad, and the freedom to be elected as national leaders. They do not want to be constrained by the "Four Cardinal Principles," so they want to overthrow the Communist Party because only after the Communist Party is overthrown can they obtain the freedom to become "elites."

In the process of demanding "democracy and freedom," these "elites" are willing to coordinate with anti-socialist forces abroad. When someone says to oppose foreign intervention, they openly declare that they are "international interventionists," wanting foreign forces to intervene as much as possible. However, now Wu'er Kaixi and Yan Jiaqi and their ilk cannot even find a place to stay in China, and can only often stand in front of foreigners and cry. When Wu'er Kaixi first escaped to Paris, he boasted that he would ring the death knell of the CCP in two years, but after just over two months, on the eve of the so-called "hundred-day memorial," he told reporters who visited him that he "doubted whether he could return to China in his lifetime." Just as the "Federal Alliance" in the United States could not find the "Spring of China," how could Wu'er Kaixi and his ilk find "democracy and freedom" abroad?

Since the Beijing turmoil was suppressed, the dark clouds hanging over China have gradually dissipated. The Chinese government has vigorously launched the work of rectification and rectification, correcting economic mistakes and investigating corruption. The "Seven Measures" and the anti-pornography campaign have been widely welcomed by the people. Lu Xun said: The enemy is not to be feared, but the most to be feared is the worms in one's own ranks. The CCP must be ruthless in gaining the trust of the people and eliminating worms. At the moment when the bad things of the turmoil are turning into good things, it coincides with the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, and this transformation is the most valuable gift for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

    有关北京暴乱前后的几件事
    多伦多约克大学政治系副教授　詹文义
    中国北京6月初的暴乱的起因与过程，错综复杂，非运用冷静和理智的头脑去分析，是很难全面了解其来龙去脉的。不幸的是中国之外的一些“人权与民主斗士”们，在北京的学潮才开始时，便以“歇斯底里”的心态来对它作出一连串的冲动和盲目的反应，有意地或无意地对北京的暴乱及那些想在国际上孤立中国的企图，起了煽风点火的作用。
    由于篇幅有限，本文无法详论造成北京暴乱的内因（如对改革开放失去宏观的控制所引起的诸多的问题、腐化和贪污舞弊、对四个坚持说而不做、对年轻的一代放弃思想与爱国教育等），只能简单扼要地分析一下暴乱前后发生的“里外呼应”的一些事实，希望海外华人了解了这些事实之后，能大大提高警惕。
    （一）反社会主义拉拉队
    海外的一些华人，在北京学潮一开始发生，不查清实情，便歇斯底里地发表声明，举行示威，大喊打倒李鹏政府，乞求外国政府制裁中国及与其断绝一切合作关系，资助中国留加学生及学者背弃其祖国，令中国蒙受人才外流的严重损失。总之，这些人在“人权与民主”的名堂下，尽力打击与涂黑中国在国际上的形象与声望，以达到孤立中国并使其现政府瓦解的目的。这恰好和策划北京暴乱的“精英分子”的目标是相辅相成的。
    同时，这些“人权与民主”的支援者，还和那些获得国外反中国社会主义的组织与人士的协助而从“地下轨道”窜逃到国外的所谓“学运与民运的精英分子”连成一气，一呼一应。忽而到芝加哥去搞什么“全美大会”，忽而又要到巴黎去开什么“成立大会”，忽而是“国殇日”游行，忽而又是什么“百日祭”。你唱我和，形成一支反中国政府、反社会主义的国际拉拉队，开口闭口都说“全球华人同心一志支持”他们“声讨中国政府的暴行”。
    这些人是否调查过？全球的华人真的是支持他们吗？中国之外的一些华文传媒，多数是拉拉队的喉舌。这些传媒自称是“真理”的卫士和“民主与自由的朋友”，实际上却把持异议者的意见一律格杀，结果人们在这些传媒上所看到的都是清一色的反中国政府的言论。难怪拉拉队要沾沾自喜地以为是得到了“全球华人”的支持了。可是他们可知道，华人聚居的新加坡和马来西亚，偏偏就没有这些歇斯底里的反应和活动。新加坡《联合早报》的许多读者便认为李鹏政府是开明和进步的，而学生的行动却较为“偏激”，“不知适可而止，步步进迫，不肯退让，以致闹成流血收场。”
    （二）里外呼应
    早在去年，香港的华文传媒和“学者文人”便开始制造“倒邓保赵”的舆论。一方面说邓小平、李鹏如何如何，要他们负责近数年来经济上的失误。另一方面又吹捧赵紫阳为难得的人才，思想开明，如果由他来实行独裁的“强人政治”，中国的改革开放就有奔头。这种言论也正好与中国国内搞学潮与动乱的“精英分子”的意见一呼一应的。
    在同个时期，流亡美国的“民联”与“中国之春”，特地为所谓“杨巍事件”派人到上海去闹事，随着又在北美、西欧和香港掀起学者和一些诺贝尔奖得主的签名运动，要中国“尊重人权”和释放魏京生和其他政治犯。同时，香港一些人士又发动市民签名运动，并派代表团上北京向人大上书，提出释放魏京生等的同样要求。
    在中国国内，也在同个时期，一些北大的学生忙着搞所谓“民主沙龙”的活动，专门邀请外国人及国内的所谓“民主战士”去发表攻击四个坚持及“保守派”的各种言论。
    去年夏天，《河殇》这部录影电视历史评论片在中国登场，完全否定了中国文明所做出的贡献和价值，全面接受西方“蔚蓝色的海洋文化”。这是“全盘西化”理论的普及本，也是为动乱制造舆论的一个环节。
    中国的一些向往“走向世界”的知识分子，还和驻中国的外交官、学者及通讯记者搞起所谓“大中小”（视地位而定）的“洋沙龙”，与外国人大拉关系，做为“走向世界”的门径。结果，主要的“精英”们，便几乎每个月（甚至每星期）都有外国人或机构，邀请他们去“开会”、“讲学”或领取“人权”或“民主”奖金或奖状。刘晓波才读完师大的博士课程，便摇身一变而成为国际闻名的“文坛黑马”，即刻受邀到欧美来“讲学”。
    中国难道没有比刘晓波之流更有学术地位和成就的学者吗？当然有，只是他们不情愿从事丑化中国政府及社会主义，去换取成为外国人膝上的宠物，因而他们便少有被邀出国去讲学的机会了。
    “里外呼应”的一次高潮是发生于今年3月底。当时美国总统布什访问北京临别举行国宴，用非外交公认的手续私下邀请了方励之赴宴。可是由于美方交给中方的宴客名单上没有方的名字，按外交礼节及为了国宾的安全，他便被拒之于宴会门外。可是由于被拒者是国际上反社会主义者的宠儿，国际舆论马上指责中方无理，尤其是海外的中文传媒，更是高喊“方励之受辱”，“中国失了国格”，要中方向方和布什道歉，把是非完全颠倒过来。
    那天看电视的人，都可看到方励之自始至终是和美国人站在一起的，招待记者时也由美国人陪在身旁当顾问，大有“美国人在我身边，谁敢动我”的不可一世的神气。任何有自尊心的华人看了，都会起反感的。
    （三）传媒兴风作浪
    中国之外的一些华文传媒，对上述“里外呼应”的各个事件，无不尽力渲染及火上加油。在北京学潮开始发生后，这些传媒更加无所忌惮地报道或刊登任何能涂黑中国政府的传闻。很多不是事实的谣言，也用作头条新闻把它报道出来。
    就以6月4日多市能看到的华文报章来说，每一则有关北京平乱的头条新闻的标题，其远离事实的程度，令人不敢相信。北美一家华文大报那天的头条新闻的标题这样写道：“北京大屠杀尸骸枕藉死伤十万”。其实，就是吾尔开希自己在芝加哥做出的估计，也只有3000人死亡（他起初在巴黎的估计是2000人死亡），1万多人受伤。可是《纽约时报》驻北京记者NicholasKristof就不同意以上的死亡数字，他调查了北京地区的医院和访问了驻北京的各报记者和学生之后，他的结论是在6月3日和4日平乱中丧生的人数是在400人至800人之间（见本年6月22日多市《星报》）。中国官方的数字是死者300多人。在死者的人数方面，中国官方的数字显然是较为接近纽约时报的估计的。
    在北京发生暴乱前后，海外的大多数华文传媒对中国局势的报道，10项中就有9项以上不是谣言便是歪曲或夸张的报道。邓小平逝世了，邓颖超要撕毁党员证了，解放军对峙要发生内战了，等等，危言耸听，不一而足。
    以上这些报道后来被证实是捏造的谣言。奇怪的是这些自命要说“真话”的传媒，却毫无报人应有的责任感，误导了读者与大众，却连一个“更正”或一声道歉都没有。更有趣的是那些自命是“人权与民主战士”之流，凡是中国政府对平乱事件所提出的分析与说明，他们不看也不读，便一口咬定说是假话谎言。另一方面，他们对传媒上所说所写的连篇累牍的假话与谎言，却视如至宝，争先恐后地把这些假话与谎言传播到中国去。结果，这些不翔实的报道和谣言，便被国内一些人接受为真的事实，对反政府的活动起了兴风作浪及火上添油的误导作用。
    （四）谁的“民主与自由”
    有人把参加北京游行、绝食及反抗戒严令的学生及民众说成是“爱国”的，也说他们所提出的是“进步”的要求，毫无疑问的，这些人当中，确实有爱国和进步的人士。可是，策划这次反政府行动的那些“人权与民主斗士”以及一些所谓智囊团的成员和作为这一次行动发言人的自命为“精英”的学生领袖，无论从任何角度来看，都不能说是爱国和进步的。
    这些人要中国全面搞资本主义，他们以为这样做会为中国的大多数人带来财富。这真是天真的梦想。今天，资本主义已经是国际性的了，它已经不能局限于一国中发生。西方的大多数人生活好了，可是这种财富之得来是建筑在维持亚非拉大多数人长久穷困的基础上的。美国的人口只有全世界的5％，可是5％的人却消费了全世界30％的资源。倘使在国际资本主义制度里，富国与穷国的交易是平等的，这种情况怎会发生呢？
    中国如果要成为另一个资本主义国家，它便必须同现有的资本主义国家竞争，以取得剥削其他国家的权利。但是这是不可能的，世界上可以剥削的地方早已给人霸占去了，就是有剩下一些残羹，现有的资本主义国家也不会白白让中国攫取去的。在这种情形下，中国如要发展资本主义，唯一的办法是接受寄人篱下的发展，成为一个既非殖民地又非资本主义的买办资本主义国家，到时中国的老百姓又将重回到当年的军阀时代。主张要这样的中国的人，可以说是“爱国”和进步的吗？其实，中国经过十年的改革开放，已经尝试到了一些资本主义的发展，可是它也带来了通货膨胀、贪污舞弊、农村医疗卫生护理走下坡、妇女在社会上的地位倒退以及环境的污染与破坏等，这些还不足以引起人们的警惕吗？
    这些人要求的民主也是西方式的，可是他们是否知道西方的民主政治结构是在自由市场经济建立了巩固的基础之后才以“锦上添花”的姿态出现的。在西欧的工业革命时期是没有民主的。其实，英国的妇女一直到1920年后才取得选举权的，而加国魁北克的妇女却要等到1940年才能投票。
    至于自由，这些“精英”所要的不外是要成为“精英”的自由。其实，中国的大学生，本来已是天之骄子，比加拿大的大学生更具“精英”性。只要问一声：中国11亿人口中有几个大学生，便可知道他们的优越地位了。韩素音说，这些大学生怕沾污了他们的手，反对被下放去农村，全无为大众服务的精神。他们要有发迹的自由，也要有出国的自由，更要能被选为国家领袖的自由。他们不愿受“四个坚持”的约束，因而要打倒共产党，因为只有在共产党被推翻后，他们才能得到成为“精英”的自由。
    这些“精英”们要求“民主与自由”的过程中，情愿与国外反社会主义的势力相呼应。当有人说要反对外来的干预时，他们竟公然宣布他们是“国际干预派”，要外国势力尽量干预。可是，现在的吾尔开希与严家其之流，以中国之大都不能找到容身之地，只能时常站在外国人面前流泪。吾尔开希初次逃至巴黎时，便夸说要在两年内回北京去敲起中共的丧钟，可是才过了两个多月，他在所谓“百日祭”的前夕对访问他的记者说他“怀疑在有生之年是否能回到中国去”。正如“民联”在美国找不到“中国之春”一样，吾尔开希之流怎有可能在外国找到“民主与自由”呢？
    自从北京的暴乱被平息之后，笼罩着中国的乌云已慢慢地散开了。中国政府已经大力展开治理整顿的工作，矫正经济上的失误和查办贪污舞弊。“七件事”及扫黄的措施，已大受人民的欢迎。鲁迅说：敌人是不可怕的，最可怕的是自己队伍中的蛀虫。中共要取信于民，清除蛀虫时绝不可手软。正当暴乱的坏事在转化为好事之际，正逢国庆40周年，这个转化正好是国庆40周年的最有价值的贺礼。
