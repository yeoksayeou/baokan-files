The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee made specific arrangements on October 20 for further promoting the study of Marxist philosophy across the city, emphasizing the need to start from basic viewpoints, seek practical results, proceed in a layered manner, and focus on the study of county-level and above leading cadres in party and government organs.

Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Secretary Tan Shaowen pointed out that the members of the Municipal Party Committee must take the lead in studying philosophy well. Some classic works may have been studied in the past, but with the increase in struggle experience, new insights can still be gained from them. Starting from November, the members of the Municipal Party Committee will adhere to the system of one study day per week, using approximately one year to study around the 10 basic viewpoints proposed by the Central Propaganda Department, such as materialism, practice, the masses, connection, and development. They will study Mao Zedong's works "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On Prolonged War," as well as Deng Xiaoping's "Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth from Facts, and Unite as One to Look to the Future" and other eight articles, along with some original Marxist-Leninist philosophical works. One viewpoint will be focused on each month, with summaries in the middle and at the end of the year.

District and bureau-level leading cadres will adopt a combination of centralized training and on-the-job learning, with the city providing guidance. Grassroots cadres and workers can organize thematic lectures in grassroots party schools and workers' political schools, explaining philosophical basic viewpoints in a simple and understandable way. All news, publishing, and philosophical workers in the city should contribute to the popularization of philosophy.

In recent years, Tianjin has already had over 540 district, county, and bureau-level leading cadres participate in 10 philosophy study classes. About half of the city's section-level cadres have studied philosophy in 41 district, county, and bureau party schools, with notable effects in strengthening the principles, systematicness, foresight, and creativity in their work.

The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee requires that this study be closely linked with summarizing experiences, opposing bourgeois liberalization, and transforming worldviews, helping leading cadres at all levels to gradually use Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods to solve current work problems.

　　天津市委作出具体安排
　　党政干部带头学哲学
    本报天津电　记者肖荻报道：中共天津市委20日就进一步抓好全市马克思主义哲学学习做出具体安排，强调要从基本观点入手，讲求实效，分层次进行，重点抓好党政机关县处级以上领导干部的学习。
    天津市委书记谭绍文指出，市委常委要带头学好哲学。有些经典著作也许过去学过，但随着斗争经验的增加仍会从中获得新的启示。市委常委从11月份起，坚持每周一次的学习日制度，大体用一年左右时间，围绕中宣部提出的唯物、实践、群众、联系、发展等10个基本观点，学习毛泽东的《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《论持久战》等哲学著作，学习邓小平的《解放思想，实事求是，团结一致向前看》等8篇著作以及若干马列哲学原著。每月集中学习一个观点，年中年末小结。
    各区县局和处级领导干部，采取集中办班和在职学习两条腿走路的方法，市里加强辅导。基层干部和职工，可利用基层党校、职工政校等阵地组织专题讲座，通俗易懂地讲解哲学基本观点。全市新闻、出版、哲学工作者，都要为普及哲学作贡献。
    近年来，天津已有540多名区、县、局领导干部参加过10期哲学读书班，全市一半左右处级干部在41所区、县、局党校学过哲学，在加强工作中的原则性、系统性、预见性和创造性上效果显著。
    中共天津市委要求，此次学习与总结经验、反对资产阶级自由化和改造世界观密切结合，帮助各级领导干部逐步运用马克思主义立场、观点、方法解决当前工作中的问题。
