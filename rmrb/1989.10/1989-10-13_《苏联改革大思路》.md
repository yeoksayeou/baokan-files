The book "The Grand Strategy of Soviet Reform" edited by Lù Nánquán and published by Shenyang Publishing House integrates academic, theoretical, and practical elements. It provides a comprehensive explanation of the overall vision, characteristics, and specific reform plans for various sectors since Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1985.

Over the past four years, the Soviet Union has made some practical steps and taken specific measures in certain areas, achieving some progress. As China's reform deepens and develops, it becomes increasingly necessary to study the experiences and lessons from the reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. This book opens a window for us to understand the Soviet reform.
