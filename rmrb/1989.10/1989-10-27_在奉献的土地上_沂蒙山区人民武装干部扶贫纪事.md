In the land of dedication - A Chronicle of People's Armed Forces Cadres in Shandong's Yimeng Mountains Helping with Poverty Alleviation

Gao Jianzhong, Tan Daobo

Deng Xiaoping, who was severely injured in battle and rescued by the people of the Yimeng Mountains before returning to the front, said solemnly to the people's armed forces cadres in the Yimeng Mountains during his tenure as the political commissar of the Jinan Military Region: "The current central task of the people's armed forces is to help the people here get rid of poverty as soon as possible."

The armed forces cadres fighting in the Yimeng Mountains have well executed this military order. At the autumn poverty alleviation summary meeting held by the Shandong Military Region this year, good news was announced: more than 1,000 poverty alleviation points where the armed forces cadres in the Yimeng Mountains have been stationed have basically gotten rid of poverty, and half of the poor villages have embarked on the road to prosperity.

From Linqu in the north to Tancheng in the south, and from Rizhao in the east to Sishui in the west, the Yimeng Mountains had more than 200,000 people joining the army and fighting during the revolutionary war, more than 100,000 people actively supporting the front, and more than 60,000 outstanding sons and daughters shedding their last drop of blood for the birth of the People's Republic. Nearly 20,000 were honored for their injuries, and nearly 100 were awarded the titles of combat heroes and models. However, after liberation, this place remained poor. By 1984, there were 600,000 households with an annual per capita income of less than 150 yuan. There were more than 2,400 villages where people and livestock had difficulty finding water, 3,013 villages without electricity, and 3,019 villages without roads.

The armed forces cadres in the Yimeng Mountains discussed with surging emotions: The people of the Yimeng Mountains contributed blood and milk for the revolution, but we have not yet made a proper return to the people of the old revolutionary base areas.

For this reason, a large number of armed forces cadres stayed in the Yimeng Mountains; during the streamlining and reorganization, a number of armed forces cadres who had already settled in prosperous places were driven by a sacred mission to also take root and settle here.

Liu Ruixue, the national advanced armed forces cadre representative and the head of the Pingdu County Military Department, had already been assigned a comfortable job in Pingdu County. However, a documentary titled "The Land of Dedication" about visiting the poor in the Yimeng Mountains kept him awake all night. He went straight to the poorest Linqu County in the Yimeng Mountains. He and Fu Shaoye, the political commissar of the Linqu County Military Department, decided to choose a good grave site and work until they "climb the chimney."

Bear Zihua, the 50-year-old political commissar of the Pingyi County Military Department, was given two positions during the streamlining and reorganization: first, to continue serving; second, to be transferred to the Temporary Rest Home in Linyi City as the political commissar, which is the only central city in the Yimeng Mountains. However, his heart was in the poorest place in the Yimeng Mountains. Three days after the report was approved, he was in the cold wind, supporting his 90-year-old mother with one hand and dragging his children with the other, returning to Mengyin. Within a month, he went to the poorest Dujiaping Village in front of Menglianggu Mountain in Mengyin County to stay.

Sha Zhi, the deputy political commissar of the Cangshan County Military Department, is from the fish and rice-rich area of Nantong. During the streamlining and reorganization, relatives working in Nanjing and Nantong advised him to return. However, Sha Zhi chose the more impoverished Yinan County in the heart of the Yimeng Mountains. He wrote a letter to his family: "The people here have the founding merit for the Republic and the nurturing merit for the people's army. As a later comer with a head full of black hair, I cannot avoid the call!"

There are nearly 100 township-level military department heads who, although they do military work, do not even have a military uniform. At this time, they also separately informed their superiors from various remote mountain villages: Helping the parents and fellow villagers get rid of poverty and become rich, do not underestimate us "local guerrillas."

The armed forces cadres in the Yimeng Mountains said: Poverty alleviation must grasp the root cause and first use the advantages of the army's ideological and political work to let the people stand up in spirit. Based on this guiding ideology, they proposed the slogan of "helping the root, helping the spirit, and helping the leadership," and organized more than 1,000 propaganda and education teams to go from house to house to propagate the relevant documents of the Party Central Committee. They also used their familiarity with demobilized soldiers to cultivate and recommend young party and league members who have "seen the world" to take on the leadership responsibilities of poor villages. These "pathfinders" with high ideological awareness, strong policy consciousness, and quick-wittedness went up the mountains when they were told to, went down the wells when they were told to, and a large number of poor villages thus resonated with the thunderous sound of comprehensive management of mountains, water, forests, fields, and roads.

The armed forces cadres in the Yimeng Mountains, with their deep "affection for the children and comradeship," patiently helped the old heroes, old party members, old cadres, and old militia members of that time, as well as the difficult households who were unable to get rid of poverty quickly due to disability or injury. They went out to raise funds, and some even vacated their offices to set up various welfare enterprises in each county and some townships, inviting the "four olds" children to work here. More than 10,000 such extremely poor households have declared poverty alleviation under their support.

The Yimeng Mountains are often "trees die due to lack of water, mountains are not green due to lack of forests, and villages are not rich due to barren mountains," year after year of vicious cycles, causing poverty upon poverty. While implementing the responsibility system and large-scale management of mountains, water, and roads often form contradictions. The armed forces cadres at various poverty alleviation points mobilized the militia to voluntarily work thousands of times in agricultural basic construction and small watershed development and management in mountainous areas. The Dushan Reservoir in Juxian County, which requires the use of 270 million cubic meters of soil and stone, is one of the four major dangerous reservoirs in Shandong Province. Relevant units have attempted to repair it for several years, but it has not been able to start due to the low labor price. Huang Zhixian, the political commissar of the Juxian County Military Department, organized nearly 1,000 militia members to work hard for two winters and springs in a row, and finally ensured its safety for the people before the flood season this year.

"Starting work on the sixteenth day of the first month and leaving the village on the twentieth day of the twelfth month." This is the praise of the people of Dujiaping Village in front of Menglianggu Mountain for the county military department's political commissar Bear Zihua's insistence on staying in the village, and it is also a true portrayal of the armed forces cadres in the Yimeng Mountains staying in the village for three years.

The 50-year-old political commissar Bear Zihua settled down in two thatched houses. Whether it was blasting holes with dynamite or digging wells for water, he was always the first to do it. After Dujiaping Village declared poverty alleviation in one year, he moved to the nearby Dai Family Gully. After Dai Family Gully declared poverty alleviation, he connected the 30 poor natural villages in front of Menglianggu Mountain into one piece as his poverty alleviation point. Deng Xiaoping once said to him: Our army suffered more than 20,000 casualties here. Can you plant more than 20,000 fruit trees on the mountain to let the martyrs smile in their graves? He firmly nodded. In more than three years, he worked day and night, leading the people to develop economic forests covering 3,750 mu, planting various fruit trees totaling 187,500. He also built 1,529 water and sand retention ditches, paved 4,950 meters of water channels, and opened a ring road around the mountain.

In Linqu County, the military department head Liu Ruixue and political commissar Fu Shaoye led the military department's comrades and militia to participate in the county's barren mountain and hill development battle. Every winter and spring, they blasted tree pits with dynamite, and every spring and summer, new saplings became forests. The stone jar gully village, which had been without water and roads for 107 years since its establishment, miraculously got rid of poverty. Now, tap water flows to every household courtyard, and there are fruit trees and yellow tobacco all over the mountains. This autumn, despite the severe drought, the stone jar gully was a scene of bumper harvest. When the county declared poverty alleviation at the end of last year, the county leaders and the people unanimously recommended: The military department has indeed made a significant contribution.

In fact, it is not just the military departments of Mengyin and Linqu that have made significant contributions to poverty alleviation. Wang Weitian, the secretary of the Linyi Municipal Party Committee and the mayor, said: "The armed forces cadres at all levels in the Yimeng Mountains are a powerful force for our poverty alleviation and prosperity, and each of them has made invaluable contributions."

　　在奉献的土地上
　　——沂蒙山区人民武装干部扶贫纪事
　　高建忠　谭道博
    曾在战斗中身负重伤、被沂蒙山区群众救护才重返战场的迟浩田，任济南军区政委期间，曾风尘仆仆两上沂蒙，亲眼目睹了群众的贫困生活后，深沉地对沂蒙山区的人民武装干部说：“人武部今天的中心任务，是要帮助这里的人民尽快摆脱贫困。”
    战斗在沂蒙山区的人武干部很好地执行了这一军令。在今年秋季山东省军区召开的扶贫总结会上传出喜讯：由沂蒙山区人武干部蹲点包村的1000多个扶贫点，已经基本摆脱贫困，其中半数贫困村已经走上富裕之路。
    （一）
    北起临朐南到郯城，东自日照西至泗水的沂蒙山区，在革命战争年代有20多万人参军参战，100多万人踊跃支前，6万多优秀儿女为共和国诞生流尽了最后一滴血，近2万名光荣负伤，仅荣获战斗英雄和模范称号的就有近百名。可是，解放后这里却依然贫困。到1984年，人均年收入不足150元的贫困户多达60万家。人、畜吃水困难的村有2400多个，不通电的村3013个，不通车的村3019个。
    沂蒙山区的人武干部们心潮激荡地议论着：沂蒙人民为革命献出的是血是奶，而我们对老区人民却至今未能做出像样的回报。
    为此，一大批人武干部，留在了沂蒙山这块土地上；在精简整编中一批已在富裕之乡安家的人武干部，为神圣使命驱使，也来这里扎根落户。
    全国先进人武干部代表刘瑞雪部长原来所在的平度县，已经给他安排了舒适的工作，可是沂蒙山区同行访贫录制的一部《奉献的土地》，令他彻夜难眠。他一个人直奔沂蒙山区最贫困的临朐县。他和临朐县人武部政委傅绍业决心选好坟地，直到“爬烟囱”。
    年已50岁的平邑县武装部政委熊子和在整编中，军分区给他安排了两个位置：第一，继续留任；第二，调任临沂市干休所担任政委，那里是沂蒙山区唯一的中心城市。然而，他的心在沂蒙山区最贫困之地。报告批准的第3天，他就在寒风中手扶90多岁高龄的老母，拖儿拎女奔回蒙阴。一个月内，他下到蒙阴县最贫困的孟良崮山前杜家岭村蹲点。
    苍山县武装部副政委沙钊，老家在鱼米之乡南通。精简整编时，在南京、南通工作的亲属劝他回去，工作由他们联系。沙钊却选择了更贫困的沂蒙腹地沂南县。他写信告诉家里人：“这里的人民对共和国有奠基之功，对人民军队有养育之恩，我这满头青丝的后来者，难辞其召唤啊！”
    还有近百名的乡镇人武部长，他们虽然做军事工作，可是连一身军装都没有。这时候，他们也从各个偏僻山乡分别信告上级：帮助父老乡亲脱贫致富，可别小瞧了我们这些“土八路”。
    （二）
    沂蒙山区的人武干部们说：扶贫要抓根本，首先要用军队思想政治工作的优势，让群众振作起精神。从这一指导思想出发，他们提出了“扶本扶志扶班子”的口号，并且组织起1000多个宣教小组，走家串户宣传党中央的有关文件，还利用自己熟悉军队退伍战士的优势，培养推荐“见过世面”的年轻党团员，挑起了贫困村的领导重担。这些思想觉悟高、政策意识强、脑瓜子灵的“领路人”，说上山就上山，要下井就下井，一大批贫困村从此风风火火地响起了山水林田路综合治理的隆隆炮声。
    沂蒙山区的人武干部们以深厚的“子弟恩、战友情”，特别耐心地帮助当年的老英模、老党员、老干部和老民兵，以及因残因伤而无力尽快脱贫的困难户。他们四出筹措资金，有的还腾出办公室，在每个县和一些乡镇办起了各种福利企业，请“四老”子弟来这里做工。上万个这样的特贫户在他们的搀扶下，已宣告脱贫。
    沂蒙山区常常是“树因水缺而不活，山因无林而不绿，村因山荒而不富”，年复一年的恶性循环，造成贫上加贫。而实行承包责任制，和大规模的治理山、水、路常常形成矛盾。在各扶贫点上的人武干部便把民兵发动起来，成千万人次地义务投工于农田基本建设和山区小流域开发治理。需动用2.7亿土石方的莒南县陡山水库，是山东省的四大险库之一。有关单位几年试图维修，都因劳动工价太低没有劳力开工。莒南县武装部政委黄志先组织起近千名民兵，连续苦战两个冬春，终于在今年汛期前使其安全造福于人民。
    （三）
    “正月十六就下点，腊月二十才离村”。这是孟良崮山前杜家岭村群众夸赞县武装部熊子和政委坚持蹲点的话，也是所有沂蒙山区人武干部3年蹲点的真实写照。
    50多岁的熊政委在两间柴草屋里安下了家。不论放炮打眼，还是打井下水，他都是带头干。杜家岭一年宣告脱贫，他又住到附近的戴家沟，戴家沟脱贫，他把孟良崮山前的30个贫困自然村连成一片，作为自己的扶贫点。迟浩田曾对他说：我军当年在这里伤亡了两万多战士，你能不能在山上栽下两万多棵果树，让先烈含笑于九泉。他坚定地点了点头。3年多时间，他没日没夜地苦干，带领群众发展经济林3750亩，栽种各种果树18.75万棵。还建起了1529处拦水拦沙谷坊，修砌水渠4950米，开出了环山路。
    在临朐县，武装部刘瑞雪部长和傅绍业政委带领武装部的同志和民兵参与了全县荒山荒坡开发大战。年年冬春炮炸树坑，年年春夏新苗成林。建村107年一直缺水无路的石瓮沟村，奇迹般地摆脱了贫困。如今自来水流到每个农户庭院，还有漫山遍野的果树加黄烟。今秋大旱，石瓮沟却是一派丰收景象。当这个县于去年底宣告脱贫时，县领导和群众一致推举：武装部可是立了头功。
    其实，扶贫立头功的又何止蒙阴、临朐两个武装部。临沂地委书记、专员王渭田说：“沂蒙山区各县乡镇人武干部，是我们脱贫致富的强大生力军，个个功不可没。”
