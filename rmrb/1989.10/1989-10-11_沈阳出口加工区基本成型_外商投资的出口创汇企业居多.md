The construction of the Shenyang Export Processing Zone is basically complete, and the first medium-sized enterprise is about to start production.

The Shenyang Zhangshi Export Processing Zone began construction in June of last year. After 15 months of intense work, dozens of factory buildings have been erected; 400 digital telephone lines have been installed, allowing for direct telegraph, telephone, telex, and fax communication with over 150 countries and regions around the world; and a large-scale substation with a daily power supply capacity of 170,000 kilowatt-hours, as well as centralized heating and water supply and drainage projects, have been completed. The largest container storage and transit center in the country, with an area of 160,000 square meters, has also been connected with 27 provinces and cities nationwide for networked operations.

The Shenyang Export Processing Zone will focus on developing advanced technology industries, exporting foreign exchange earnings, and importing products to replace domestic ones. Currently, projects under construction include the pharmaceutical, rubber, stone processing, light industry, textile, and machinery and electrical industries. Advanced technology enterprises account for 76% of the total investment in the zone, and foreign-invested enterprises with investments of over $3 million that generate foreign exchange earnings account for 63% of the total number of enterprises. The Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory's sulfadimidine and phosphomycin project, with a total investment of 53.94 million yuan, has begun equipment debugging and will soon enter trial production. The three cargo ships operated in cooperation with the Shenyang Shipping Company are already in operation on international routes in Singapore and Hong Kong.
