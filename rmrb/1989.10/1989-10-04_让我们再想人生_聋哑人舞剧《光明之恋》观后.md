After the curtain fell on the performance by the China Disabled Persons' Performing Arts Troupe at the Second Chinese Art Festival, my heart remained unsettled for a long time.

The beautiful melodies played by the blind musicians from Beijing made me marvel at the extraordinary wisdom of disabled people; the "Eagle Disco" performed by two young men from Shandong with one leg each made me wonder at the tenacious vitality of disabled people. However, what truly shook my soul was the four-act dance drama "Love of Light" performed by 18 deaf-mute youths. This was the first time such a large-scale dance drama was performed on the stage of disabled people's art in China. A story that unfolds with music and dance, like a parable of life, calls out to people's emotions and urges them to reflect on life.

A young and beautiful girl, in the prime of her life, suddenly faced a disaster. A car accident left her blind. The brilliance of her past life vanished, and the loneliness of the blind soul made her suffocate in pain and collapse under pressure. At this moment, a young man's strong arm stopped her from taking her own life. He was a boy who had always admired her but never dared to pursue her. He comforted the girl, caressed her, let her feel the breath of the sea, and listen to the call of the seagulls. He encouraged the girl to soar towards the boundless blue sky over the sea. He accompanied her, breaking through the wind and fog, soaring, soaring... Finally, true love conquered sorrow and pain, and the girl's life regained its desire to live and pursue development. Yes, life is hard, and all kinds of sufferings will come at any time. But human life will not be trivial. "The path of life is always progressing, always moving upwards along the infinite spiritual triangle's slope, and nothing can stop it." (Lu Xun's words)

When a group of young men and women lifted the blind girl into the air, and colorful rainbows shone around them, people could not help but understand: when a person's life is struck down, it is often difficult to bear the misfortune with one's own strength, and one often needs the help of other lives around, whether it is understanding or dedication. Life needs people who dare to take responsibility for the environment on which human life depends.

The overall director of the dance drama "Love of Light" is Zhang Guoyu from the China Opera and Dance Drama Theater. She and her colleagues, with great effort, spent less than two months guiding more than ten deaf-mute youths to present this dance drama, which is condensed with the philosophy of life, miraculously on the Chinese art stage. This fact itself makes people see that around those disabled lives that most need understanding and help from society, there are indeed people who are working hard with love for others' lives, making those lives that have suffered misfortune shine brightly on the path of fate.

    让我们再想人生
    ——聋哑人舞剧《光明之恋》观后
    高钢
    在第二届中国艺术节里，当中国残疾人艺术团演出的帷幕落下之后，我的心依然久久地不能平静。
    北京盲人的民乐合奏传出的优美旋律，使我感叹于残疾人所具有的惊人的智慧；两位山东独腿青年跳出的“雄鹰迪斯科”，又使我惊异于残疾人的顽强的生命力。然而，最使我的心灵为之震颤的，是18位聋哑青年演出的四幕舞剧——《光明之恋》。在中国残疾人艺术舞台上，演出这样规模的舞剧，还是第一次。一个随着音乐、舞蹈起伏延伸的生活中的故事，宛如一首人生的寓言诗，呼唤着人们感情的激流，敦促着人们对于人生的思考。
    一个年轻美貌的姑娘，正值人生中最美好的时光，突然灾变临头而降，一次车祸，使姑娘双目失明。往日生活的光辉消失了，失明者灵魂的孤寂，使她在痛苦中窒息，在压抑中崩溃。就在这时，一个青年的坚实的臂膀阻止了她的轻生。这是一个过去一直爱慕她，却没敢大胆追求她的男孩子。他安慰着姑娘，爱抚着姑娘，让她去感受大海的呼吸，让她去聆听海燕的召唤。他鼓励姑娘，朝大海之上的无限的蓝天飞翔。他陪伴着她，穿风破雾，飞翔，飞翔……终于真挚的爱战胜了悲哀、战胜了痛苦，姑娘的生命又复原了渴望生存、追求发展的本色。是啊，生活是艰辛的，各种各样的苦难也会随时而至。但是，人的生命，决不苟且。“生命的路总是进步的，总是沿着无限的精神三角形的斜面向上走，什么都阻止他不得”。　（鲁迅语）
    当一群男女青年，将双目失明的姑娘托举在空中，斑斓的彩虹在他们的周围熠熠闪光时，人们不能不领悟到：一个人的生命遭到摧击之时，往往难以靠自己的力量承受不幸，往往需要身边其他生命的救助，或者是理解，或者是奉献，生活中需要有人敢于为人的生命赖以生存的环境负起责任。
    舞剧《光明之恋》的总编导，是中国歌剧舞剧院的张国瑜同志，她和她的同事们呕心沥血，用了不到两个月的时间，指导十几名聋哑青年，把这个凝炼了人生哲理的舞剧，奇迹般地显现在中国的艺术舞台上。这件事本身，就使人们看到，在最需要社会理解和帮助的那些残疾生命的周围，确实已有对别人的生命怀着挚爱的人们辛勤地劳作着，才使那些蒙受不幸的生命，迸发出可以映亮命运前程的光辉。
