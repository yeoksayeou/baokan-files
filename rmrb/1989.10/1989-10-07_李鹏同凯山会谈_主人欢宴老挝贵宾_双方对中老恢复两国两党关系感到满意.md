Li Peng Meets with Kaysone Phomvihane; Hosts Welcome Banquet for Lao Guests
Both Sides Satisfied with the Restoration of Sino-Lao Relations

BEIJING, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) — Premier Li Peng held a formal friendly talk with Kaysone Phomvihane, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and General Secretary of the People's Revolutionary Party of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, this morning at the Great Hall of the People.

At the beginning of the talk, Kaysone Phomvihane told Li Peng that it had been over a decade since they last met, and he was very pleased to be in China this time. He believed that this visit would contribute to the comprehensive restoration of relations between the two governments, parties, and peoples, promote mutual understanding and cooperation, and contribute to peace in the Asia-Pacific region.

During the three-hour talk, Kaysone Phomvihane detailed the economic construction and reforms in Laos. He said that Laos is currently implementing the "New Economic Policy," developing multiple economic components, emphasizing the role of state-owned enterprises, and opposing bureaucratism and bourgeois liberalization. The reforms in Laos are generally aimed at consolidating, developing, and improving the people's democratic system and gradually transitioning to socialism.

Kaysone Phomvihane believed that the development of relations between the two countries and parties is very important for Laos and expressed satisfaction with the restoration and development of relations between the two countries and parties in recent years.

During the talk, Kaysone Phomvihane also introduced Laos' views on the international situation and its foreign policy to Li Peng.

Li Peng said that Sino-Lao relations have always been good, but due to historical reasons, there was a period when relations were somewhat strained. He believed that Kaysone Phomvihane's visit this time would become a turning point for the restoration and development of relations between the two parties and countries. He said that China has provided some assistance to Laos in the past and will, in the future, gradually develop various forms of economic cooperation and trade relations based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.

When discussing the international situation, Li Peng emphasized that the overall trend of the current international situation is easing, with easing factors increasing, but the factors of war, especially local wars, have not been eliminated. He said that the only way to solve the Cambodian problem is for Vietnam to truly and completely withdraw from Cambodia and establish a four-party joint government led by Prince Sihanouk.

Li Peng introduced the current situation of China's reform and opening up to the guests. He said that we are now focusing on two aspects: one is to adhere to reform and opening up, which helps to improve the socialist system; the other is to adhere to the four cardinal principles. Among the four cardinal principles, the most important for China is the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist road.

At the end of the talk, Kaysone, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and the Lao government, invited Li Peng to visit Laos at his convenience. Li Peng expressed his thanks, and the specific time will be discussed through diplomatic channels.

Before the talk, Premier Li Peng held a welcoming ceremony at the East Gate Plaza of the Great Hall of the People to warmly welcome Kaysone and his entourage.

BEIJING, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) — Premier Li Peng hosted a banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly welcome Kaysone Phomvihane, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and General Secretary of the People's Revolutionary Party of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.

In his toast, Li Peng said, "China and Laos are neighbors with a long history of traditional friendship. Although our relations have had some twists and turns, compared to our long history of friendship, it is only a brief moment and has already become past. It is gratifying that in recent years, with the joint efforts of both sides, the relations between our two countries and parties have been gradually improved, personnel exchanges have increased, and border trade has become more active. Kaysone's visit marks the comprehensive restoration of Sino-Lao relations between the two countries and parties. This not only serves the fundamental interests of the peoples of China and Laos but also contributes to peace and stability in the region. We are willing to work with Lao comrades to continuously promote Sino-Lao friendly neighborly relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Li Peng said, "Both China and Laos are developing countries facing the arduous task of developing the economy and improving people's living standards. Although our national conditions are not exactly the same, there are many aspects in which we can learn from and draw on each other in the construction and reform of our countries."

Li Peng pointed out that the world is currently undergoing profound changes from confrontation to dialogue and from tension to easing. This is the result of the long-term efforts of the peoples of all countries. But the world is still not peaceful, and hegemonism, arms races, regional conflicts, and North-South contradictions still plague international society to varying degrees. Due to differences in social systems and ideologies, struggles remain very sharp. In this new situation, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should become the criterion for solving international political and economic problems. The Chinese government and people are willing to work with the peoples of all countries to continue to strive for further easing of the international situation, maintaining world peace, and striving for the common development of mankind.

Kaysone Phomvihane said in his toast, "The peoples of Laos and China have a long history of traditional friendship. The Lao people are happy with the great achievements China has made in building the People's Republic of China, especially in the past 10 years of reform and opening up, and we also pay close attention to everything that happens in China. We agree with and support the four cardinal principles and the policy of opening up to the outside world formulated by the Communist Party of China, and support the decisive and timely measures you have taken to thwart the plots of imperialism and reactionary forces to sabotage the achievements of China's socialist revolution. We highly appreciate the normalization of relations between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union and believe that this is an important contribution to world peace and stability."

Kaysone Phomvihane said, "The world situation is shifting from confrontation to dialogue and easing. However, there are still many contradictions in the world today, and there is still struggle in peaceful coexistence. To this end, Laos will continue to strengthen and deepen friendly relations and comprehensive cooperation with various socialist brother countries and expand foreign relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong, and others attended the banquet.

    李鹏同凯山会谈　主人欢宴老挝贵宾
    双方对中老恢复两国两党关系感到满意
    本报北京10月5日讯　记者孙毅报道：国务院总理李鹏今天上午在人民大会堂同老挝人民民主共和国部长会议主席、人民革命党总书记凯山·丰威汉举行了正式友好会谈。
    会谈开始时，凯山·丰威汉对李鹏总理说，阔别十多年，这次来到中国感到十分高兴。相信这次访问将为全面恢复两国政府、两党和两国人民的关系，推动我们相互了解和合作作出贡献，为亚太和平作出贡献。
    在持续3个小时的会谈中，凯山·丰威汉详细介绍了老挝国内经济建设和改革的情况。他说，目前老挝正在实行“新经济政策”，发展多种经济成份，重视国营企业的作用，反对官僚主义，反对资产阶级自由化等。老挝所进行的改革，总的就是要巩固、发展和完善人民民主制度，逐步向社会主义过渡。
    凯山·丰威汉认为，老中两国、两党关系的发展对老挝来说是十分重要的，他表示对过去几年来两国、两党关系的恢复和发展感到满意。
    会谈中，凯山·丰威汉还向李鹏总理介绍了老挝对国际形势的看法以及老挝的对外政策。
    李鹏说，中老关系过去一直是很好的，但是由于历史的原因，两国关系有一段时间比较冷淡。相信这次凯山·丰威汉的来访，将成为两党、两国关系恢复和发展的转折点。他说，中国过去对老挝有过一些帮助，今后将根据平等互利的原则，逐步发展各种形式的经济合作和贸易关系。
    在谈到国际形势时，李鹏强调指出，目前国际形势总的趋势是缓和，缓和的因素在增长，但是战争的因素，特别是局部战争的因素并没有消除。他说，解决柬埔寨问题的唯一出路是越南真正地、全部地从柬埔寨撤军，并在柬埔寨成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府。
    李鹏向客人们介绍了中国目前改革、开放的情况。他说，我们现在是两手，一手是坚持改革开放，这有助于完善社会主义制度；一手是坚持四项基本原则。四项基本原则中，对中国来说最重要的就是共产党的领导和社会主义道路。
    会谈结束时，凯山代表老挝人民革命党中央委员会和老挝政府邀请李鹏总理在他方便的时候访问老挝，李鹏总理对此表示感谢，具体时间将通过外交途径商谈。
    会谈前，国务院总理李鹏在人民大会堂东门外广场举行欢迎仪式，热烈欢迎凯山·丰威汉一行。
    本报北京10月6日讯　记者孙毅报道：国务院总理李鹏今天晚上在人民大会堂举行宴会，热烈欢迎老挝人民民主共和国部长会议主席、人民革命党总书记凯山·丰威汉。
    李鹏总理在祝酒辞中说，中老两国山水相连，两国人民之间的传统友谊源远流长。尽管我们两国关系也有过一段曲折，但同我们长期友好的历史相比，只不过是短暂的一瞬，而且已成为过去。令人高兴的是，近年来，在双方的共同努力下，我们两国和两党关系得到了逐步改善，人员往来不断增加，边境贸易日趋活跃。他说，凯山同志的来访标志着中老两国、两党关系的全面恢复。这不仅符合中老两国人民的根本利益，而且也有利于本地区的和平与稳定。我们愿意和老挝同志一起，在和平共处五项原则的基础上把中老睦邻友好关系不断推向前进。
    李鹏说，中老两国都是发展中国家，都面临着发展经济、提高人民生活水平的艰巨任务。两国国情虽不尽相同，但在建设和改革事业中有许多方面可以互相学习和借鉴。
    李鹏总理指出，当今世界正经历着从对抗走向对话、从紧张转向缓和的深刻变化，这是世界各国人民长期努力的结果。但这个世界还不太平，霸权主义、军备竞赛、地区冲突、北南矛盾还在不同程度上困扰国际社会。由于社会制度、意识形态的不同，斗争仍然十分尖锐。在这种新形势下，和平共处五项原则应当成为解决国际政治问题和国际经济问题的准则。中国政府和中国人民愿同世界各国人民一道，为进一步缓和国际局势，维护世界和平和争取人类共同发展而继续努力。
    凯山·丰威汉在祝酒辞中说，老中两国人民有着悠久的传统友谊。老挝人民对中国人民在40年里建设中华人民共和国特别是在改革开放的10年中所取得的巨大成就感到高兴，同时也关注在中国所发生的一切。我们赞同并支持中国共产党制定的四项基本原则和对外开放政策，支持你们为挫败帝国主义和反动势力企图破坏中国社会主义革命成果的阴谋所采取的果断和及时的措施。我们对中华人民共和国同苏联的关系正常化予以高度评价，并认为这是对世界和平与稳定作出的重要贡献。
    凯山·丰威汉说，世界形势从对峙转向对话和缓和。但是当前世界上仍然存在着许多矛盾，和平共处中还存在着斗争。为此，老挝将继续加强和密切同各社会主义兄弟国家的友好关系和全面合作，在和平共处五项原则基础上扩大对外关系。
    国务院副总理吴学谦、全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲等出席宴会作陪。
