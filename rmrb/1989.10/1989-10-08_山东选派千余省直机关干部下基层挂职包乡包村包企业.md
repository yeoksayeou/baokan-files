Shandong has selected over a thousand officials from provincial government departments to work at the grassroots level, taking on responsibilities for counties, villages, and enterprises. These officials began concentrated study and training on October 5 and will be dispatched to various locations around October 16.

The primary tasks of these dispatched officials are to assist economically lagging and weak grassroots units in implementing the Party's lines, principles, and policies; to strengthen ideological and political work; to find paths to prosperity; and to build strong leadership teams, thus quickly transforming the backward conditions in these areas.

The Shandong Provincial Committee has always placed great importance on dispatching government officials to work at the grassroots level. Since 1985, the province has dispatched a cumulative total of 49,000 government officials to work at the grassroots level, with 29,000 still working there currently.

    山东选派千余省直机关干部下基层挂职包乡包村包企业
    本报济南10月7日电　记者贾建舟报道：山东从省直机关选派千余名干部，到基层挂职包乡包村包企业。这批干部10月5日开始集中学习培训，将于16日左右分赴各地。
    这批下派干部的主要任务是：帮助经济发展缓慢、工作基础比较薄弱的基层单位，贯彻落实党的路线、方针和政策；加强思想政治工作；寻找致富门路；建设好的领导班子，以尽快改变当地的后进面貌。
    山东省委对选派机关干部到基层工作，一直非常重视。1985年以来，全省先后选派到基层工作的机关干部，累计达4.9万多人，目前仍在基层工作的还有2.9万多人。
