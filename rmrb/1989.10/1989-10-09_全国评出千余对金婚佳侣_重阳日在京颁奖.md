Over a thousand couples nationwide have been recognized for their golden anniversaries. Today, in Beijing, on the occasion of the Double Ninth Festival, 50 representative couples received awards on behalf of the 1,290 couples who were honored in the "National Golden Anniversary Couples Selection and Commemoration Activity."

The event, organized by the All-China Women's Federation, the China National Committee on Aging, China Women's News, and Zhejiang Yunshan Pharmaceutical Factory, brought together golden anniversary couples from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. Among the 103 couples who received honorable mentions, 58% were couples who had chosen their partners freely and independently. Their ranks include veterans who marched together through the Long March and spent their lives in military service, intellectuals who dedicated themselves to science and flew together, as well as workers and farmers who made silent contributions. There were also representatives from nine minority ethnic groups, including Uygurs, Manchus, Mongols, Tujia, and Yi, as well as a couple who were reunited after nearly 40 years of separation by the Taiwan Strait. Their common traits are steadfast love, civilized family traditions, and significant contributions to society.

Comrades Xi Zhongxun, Chen Muxia, Lei Jieqiong, Kang Keqing, and Wang Zhuohua presented the Double Crane Cups to the golden anniversary couples.
