    From the winter of 1987 to the spring of 1988, 1073 households in our township purchased 45275 bags (bottles) of black fungus seeds from the township forestry sales station's fungus seed factory for producing black fungus. A total of 6467 racks were set up. This year, when the racks were started, all of them were "bare," causing the farmers a direct economic loss of over 730,000 yuan. After learning of this situation, the leaders of the prefectural committee instructed the county committee and county government to handle the matter promptly. In June of this year, after the county organized three investigations and technical appraisals, the result was that the batch of black fungus seeds sold by the township forestry sales station's fungus seed factory was of inferior quality. However, this problem has not been resolved to this day.

    菌种厂售劣种坑人  调查组空忙活无用
    1987年冬至1988年春，我乡有1073户生产黑木耳的农民购买了乡林业经销站菌种厂生产销售的黑木耳菌种45275袋（瓶），共点耳架6467个，今年起架时全部是“光棍”，给农民造成直接经济损失73万多元。地委领导同志得知这一情况后，指示我县县委、县政府及时处理。今年6月，经县里组织三次调查和技术鉴定，结果是：我乡林业经销站菌种厂销售的这批黑木耳菌种属劣质菌种。但这一问题至今仍没解决。
