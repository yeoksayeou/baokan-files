The first volume of "The Red Scarf of the Earth," which won the gold medal for comic strips at the Seventh National Art Exhibition, has recently been published by the Chinese Comic Strip Publishing House. This work, which reflects the epic of the 25,000-mile Long March of the Red Army, consists of five volumes and over 800 illustrations. It is a major project in the field of comic strip creation and publishing. To gather opinions and promote the development of comic strip work, the Chinese Comic Strip Publishing House recently held a discussion meeting in Beijing.

The Chinese Comic Strip Publishing House was established in 1985. Since its founding, the comic strip industry has faced its most severe slump since the founding of the nation. The Chinese Comic Strip Publishing House has always insisted on prioritizing social benefits and providing high-quality spiritual nourishment for the broad masses of readers and young people. "The Red Scarf of the Earth" is one of such works. Participants at the meeting enthusiastically affirmed the importance and positive role of publishing this comic strip and praised the Chinese Comic Strip Publishing House for adhering to the correct socialist publishing direction. The original author Wei Wei expressed his congratulations at the meeting, and the illustrator Shen Yao Yi also shared his creative experiences.

    《地球的红飘带》连环画座谈会
    在第七届全国美展中，荣获连环画金奖的《地球的红飘带》（一集），最近已由中国连环画出版社出版。这部反映红军二万五千里长征伟大史诗的作品共五集，八百余幅，是连环画编创、出版事业的一项重大工程，为了听取意见，推动连环画工作的发展，中国连环画出版社于近日在北京召开了座谈会。
    中国连环画出版社是一九八五年成立的。建社以来，连环画适逢建国以来最严重的滞销局面，中国连环画出版社始终坚持社会效益第一，坚持为广大读者、青少年提供良好的精神食粮，《地球的红飘带》就是其中的一部。与会者热情肯定了出版这部连环画的重要意义和积极作用，赞扬了中国连环画出版社坚持正确的社会主义出版方向。原作者魏巍在会上表示祝贺，绘画作者沈尧伊也谈了创作体会。
