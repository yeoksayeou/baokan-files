Peking University recently organized students to visit and learn about the national situation in the suburbs of Beijing, including Miyun, Shunyi, Huairou counties, and enterprises such as Shougang and Yanshan Petrochemical Company. Students generally felt that they gained a lot from this experience. Many students deeply felt that for China to become a moderately developed country, it is essential to have several decades of stable environment for economic construction. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state, reform and opening up are the path to strength, and stability and unity are the basis for national prosperity.

On the morning of September 25, over a hundred students from Peking University watched a documentary about the construction of the Miyun Reservoir at the Miyun Reservoir Management Office and listened to the introduction by relevant leaders and technical personnel about the construction at that time. In Huairou County, students were greatly inspired by the tremendous changes that have taken place since the reform and opening up.

The visits and learning experiences have given students a deeper understanding of the national situation and the complexity of solving problems. Many students said that in the past, they considered themselves outsiders, only criticizing without taking any responsibility. If they put themselves in the situation, they would be more calm and rational, avoiding many impulsive and blind actions. Many students also expressed that China's economic construction still faces many difficulties, and economic system reform, political system reform, and democratic legal construction cannot be completed overnight. They need to do a lot of hard work, and they will strive to solve these problems.

Through the visits and learning, some students also realized that not mastering the basic stance, viewpoint, and method of Marxism, not understanding the national situation, and lacking social experience are the main weaknesses of college students now. How to use the stance, viewpoint, and method of Marxism to understand society and turn theoretical knowledge into practical knowledge for serving society is an urgent task for college students to overcome their own shortcomings. Some students also mentioned that seeing oneself as inferior makes one depressed and inactive; seeing oneself as superior makes one arrogant and out of control. Only by facing oneself can one truly establish the grand ambition of serving the people and benefiting society, and avoid falling into the quagmire of self-abandonment or self-destruction. As college students trained in socialist China, only with a vigorous spirit can they strive to learn and make contributions to socialist modernization in the future.

　　北大学生参观学习了解国情
    纷纷表示要正视自己服务人民造福社会
    据新华社北京10月27日电　（记者张宝瑞、王蔚）北京大学最近组织学生分期分批到北京郊区的密云、顺义、怀柔等县农村和首钢、燕山石化公司等企业参观学习，学生们普遍感到这次收获很大。许多学生深有感触地说，中国要跻身中等发达国家行列，没有几十年稳定的环境进行经济建设是不行的。四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国之路，安定团结是国家兴旺的基础。
    9月25日上午，北大百余名学生在密云水库管理处观看了当年建设水库的纪录片，并听取了有关领导和技术人员介绍当年建设的盛况。在怀柔县，学生们为这里改革开放以来发生的巨大变化深受鼓舞。
    参观学习使学生们对国情和解决问题的复杂性有了进一步认识。许多学生说，过去自己把自己当成了局外人，只是评头品足，但不负任何责任，如果设身处地地考虑问题，就会更加冷静和理智，避免许多冲动和盲从。许多学生还表示，我国的经济建设仍然面临许多困难，经济体制改革、政治体制改革和民主法制建设决非一朝一夕所能完成，还要做许多艰苦的工作，我们要为解决这些问题而努力奋斗。
    通过参观学习，一些学生还认识到，没有掌握马克思主义的基本立场、观点和方法，不了解国情和缺乏社会经验，是大学生现在的主要弱点，如何运用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法去认识社会，把理论知识变成服务于社会的致用之学，是大学生们克服自身不足的当务之急。有的学生还谈到，自视过低使人情绪低沉，无所作为；自视过高，使人狂妄自大，行为举措失矩；只有正视自己，才能真正树立服务于人民、造福社会的宏伟志向，才会避免陷入自弃或自毁的泥潭。做为社会主义中国培养的大学生，只有以昂扬奋发的精神努力学习，以后才能为社会主义现代化建设做出贡献。
