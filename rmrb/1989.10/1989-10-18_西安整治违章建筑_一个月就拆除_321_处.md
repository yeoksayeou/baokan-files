Xi'an Cracks Down on Illegal Buildings: 321 Demolished in One Month

Xian, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an has adopted a comprehensive approach to tackle illegal constructions, demolishing 321 such structures in September alone, covering an area of 20,160 square meters. Additionally, 3,003 illegal roadside constructions were cleared from streets and alleys, returning 38,500 square meters of road space to the public.

In recent years, illegal constructions in Xi'an have posed significant threats to traffic safety and urban aesthetics. The municipal Party committee and government, in conjunction with efforts to improve the city's appearance, launched a concentrated campaign in September to address these issues. The specific measures included:

* Issuing public notices to create strong public opinion.
* Having municipal leaders conduct on-site inspections and make decisions, ensuring legal enforcement.
* Assigning responsibilities to municipal, district, and street-level authorities, with clear targets and deadlines.
* Refusing to yield to personal connections and daring to take tough actions.
* Taking legal action against a small number of individuals who resisted and disrupted the demolition of illegal constructions.

    西安整治违章建筑  一个月就拆除321处
    本报西安10月17日电　记者孟西安报道：西安市采取上下齐动手集中查处的办法，仅在9月份就拆除违章建筑321处，面积达20160平方米，清除大街小巷各种违章占道建筑3003处，使38500多平方米的道路重新归还于民。
    近年来，西安市的一些违章建筑影响了交通安全、市容观瞻。市委、市政府结合整顿市容，在9月份里集中对违章建筑进行了一次查处，具体方法是，广发布告，形成强大社会舆论；市级领导现场办公，拍板定案，以法查处；市、区、街道三级各有重点、分工负责，限期完成；不徇私情，敢于碰硬。对极少数挑衅闹事、干扰破坏拆除违章建筑的人，坚决绳之以法。
