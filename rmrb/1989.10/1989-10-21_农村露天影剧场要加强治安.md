In economically underdeveloped rural areas where cultural facilities are scarce, open-air theaters still play a crucial role in enriching the cultural lives of rural residents. However, in some places, the security of these open-air theaters has become a problem, with an increasing rate of criminal cases. Some farmers have said that now, it's hard enough to watch a movie, and they still have to worry about their safety.

In a certain township in Wuhu County, Anhui Province, on the evening of August 9, a group of young people gathered to fight during an open-air movie screening. A 21-year-old youth was stabbed by the opposing side and died after being taken to the hospital. Such tragedies are not uncommon. The main reason for the increase in crime rates at open-air theaters is the lack of management. After setting up the stage and screen, everything is done once the performance or movie is over. If a fight breaks out, in the dark, people only want to avoid it, who would dare to ask or manage?

Therefore, the author appeals: Rural grassroots organizations, mainly administrative villages or natural villages, must organize local security, militia, and youth league organizations during open-air movie screenings. Through methods such as setting up sentry posts, banning entry of unidentified individuals, and other means, strengthen the management of open-air theaters.

### 农村露天影剧场要加强治安

　　农村露天影剧场要加强治安
    在经济不很发达、文化设施缺乏的农村，露天影剧场为活跃农村群众文化生活至今仍起着重要的作用。但是，有些地方的露天影剧场治安成问题，刑事发案率上升。有的农民说，现在好不容易看一场电影，还要提心吊胆。
    安徽省芜湖县某乡，八月九日晚放映露天电影，一帮小青年聚众打架，一位年仅二十一岁的青年被对方捅了一刀，抬到医院，不治身亡。这类悲剧时有耳闻。导致露天影剧场发案率上升的原因，主要是农村的露天影剧场根本无人管理。看戏或看电影，把戏台搭起来，把银幕拉好，唱完放完便了事。若发现打架斗殴，黑灯瞎火，人们唯恐躲之不及，哪个去问，谁人去管？
    因此，笔者呼吁：农村基层组织，主要是行政村或自然村，在放露天电影时，一定要组织地方的治保、民兵、共青团等组织，通过站岗放哨、禁止身份不明的人入村等办法，加强对露天影剧场的管理。
