	Actively Guide and Promote Healthy Development:
	Jiangsu Township Enterprises Adjusted into Four Types

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. Reporter Gōng Yǒngquán reports: Recently, Jiangsu Provincial Party Secretary Hàn Péixìn conducted investigations and research in Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, and Yangzhou. He proposed to the Provincial Party Standing Committee that the current rural township enterprises are unstable and need adjustment. The policy should be to stabilize, adjust, and promote healthy development, actively guide, and lead the township enterprises in the entire province to enter a new stage of development.

	Over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, Jiangsu's township enterprises, which started early, have seen their output value increase by an average of 30.4% per year. Last year, the total output value reached 90.55 billion yuan, accounting for 42% of the province's total industrial and agricultural output value, known as "half of Jiangsu's economy." After reviewing the important role of township enterprises in the province's national economy and social development, Hàn Péixìn said that the policy towards township enterprises should remain relatively stable. We should not indiscriminately criticize township enterprises just because of rectification and adjustment, nor should we discriminate against or crush township enterprises in policy. Currently, we should especially pay attention to policy implementation, create conditions to actively guide and enthusiastically support township enterprises under the premise of obeying national macro-control, and lead them to a new path of healthy development. For a few township enterprises that have engaged in corruption, embezzlement, bribery, and other corrupt practices in their business activities, we must resolutely punish them according to law. For those that were allowed at the time but are not allowed by today's policies due to imperfect systems, we should seriously summarize experiences and lessons, improve management, and make production and operation work institutionalized and standardized.

	Hàn Péixìn continued, saying that township enterprises also need adjustment. Adjustment, especially the adjustment of industrial structure, is an objective requirement and an internal demand for the development of township enterprises. Currently, township enterprises are facing serious difficulties such as market stagnation, tight funds and energy, and large increases in raw material prices. We must go through adjustments, strengthen our "internal skills," and improve the level of enterprises to adapt to the market. We should also differentiate between different situations and adopt appropriate preferential policies to prevent some enterprises with products that are popular domestically and have certain international competitiveness from being forced to shut down.

	Currently, how should Jiangsu adjust its township enterprises? Hàn Péixìn believes that adjustments can be made in four types: First, newly established village-level enterprises that use local materials for processing and sales, known as "three local" enterprises, can be classified under diversified operations. Second, some enterprises can adjust their industrial or product structures, merge or transform according to different situations, and make their products popular to meet social needs. Third, enterprises that are necessary for large-scale industrial support and have products that are popular and in demand should be further developed. Fourth, a few enterprises with high material consumption, high energy consumption, and low-quality, high-priced products should be resolutely shut down or transformed. Through adjustments, the industrial structure and product structure of township enterprises will become more reasonable, and it will also promote the progress of enterprise management and technology.

　　积极加以引导　促使健康发展
　　江苏乡镇企业按四种类型调整
    本报南京电　记者龚永泉报道：江苏省委书记韩培信最近在常州、苏州、南通、扬州4市调查研究后，向省委常委提出建议：目前农村乡镇企业不稳定不行，不调整也不行，要采取稳定、调整、健康发展的方针，积极加以引导，使全省乡镇企业走上一个新的发展阶段。
    改革开放10年来，起步较早的江苏乡镇企业，产值平均每年递增30.4％，去年总产值达905.5亿元，占全省工农业总产值的42％，号称江苏经济的“半壁江山”。韩培信回顾乡镇企业在全省国民经济和社会发展中的重要地位后说，对乡镇企业的政策要保持相对稳定，不能因为治理、整顿，就不加分析地一味指责乡镇企业，更不能在政策上歧视、挤垮乡镇企业。当前要特别注意掌握政策，在服从国家宏观控制的前提下，创造条件积极引导、热情支持乡镇企业，使之走上新的健康发展的道路。对少数乡镇企业在经营活动中出现的贪污盗窃、行贿受贿等腐败现象，要坚决依法惩治。对因制度不健全，当时允许做而今天的政策不允许的，要认真总结经验教训，完善管理，使生产经营工作制度化、规范化。
    韩培信接着说，对乡镇企业不调整也是不行的。调整，特别是产业结构的调整，是客观形势的需要，也是乡镇企业发展的内在要求。当前乡镇企业面临着市场疲软、资金能源紧缺、原材料价格上涨幅度大等严重困难，要通过调整，练好“内功”，使企业上档次、上水平、适应市场。还应区别不同情况，采取适当的倾斜政策，使一些产品在国内适销对路，在国际上有一定竞争能力的企业不至于被迫停产。
    当前，江苏对乡镇企业如何调整呢？韩培信认为，可按四种类型进行调整：一是新办的村以下就地取材、加工和销售的“三就地”企业，可划归多种经营范畴。二是一部分企业通过产业结构或产品结构的调整，分别情况进行合并或转向，使产品畅销以适应社会需求。三是为大工业配套所必需的、产品适销对路的企业，要进一步发展。四是少数高物耗、高能耗、产品质次价高的企业，要坚决关停或转产。通过调整，使乡镇企业的产业结构、产品结构日趋合理，同时促进企业管理进步和技术进步。
