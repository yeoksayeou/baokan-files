The northern end of the Lubei Plain is home to Ling County, an ancient city with a long history and revolutionary traditions. However, the glory of history has not obscured the reality of poverty. It was not until the reform and opening-up policy, like a spring breeze, that the ancient lands along the banks of the Mahe River began to stir. The book distribution industry was also imbued with a new meaning as a "cultural and technological envoy." A new force in book distribution, the Cultural and Educational Bookstore, emerged to serve the vast rural areas along the banks of the Mahe River.

Ling County's Cultural and Educational Bookstore was established in 1983 and has since expanded to more than 20 branches. Last year, these bookstores sold textbooks and various books worth more than 1.6 million yuan, accounting for 63% of the county's total book sales. They not only solved the problem of students in the county's 52 middle and primary schools getting their textbooks in time for the spring and autumn semesters but also strove to meet the needs of the people of Ling County for cultural and technological knowledge and economic information in developing agriculture, industry, and township enterprises. Through practice, the Cultural and Educational Bookstore has opened up a new path for rural book distribution.

Ling County has a population of 550,000, of which more than 90% are engaged in agriculture. In the past, book distribution in rural areas mainly relied on the supply and marketing cooperatives. However, after the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, due to the meager profits from book sales, the supply and marketing cooperatives generally reduced or canceled book sales, resulting in only 6 out of the 24 cooperatives still having bookstores. At a critical moment when rural areas urgently needed books to provide scientific and technological knowledge and management knowledge for economic development, the book distribution channels in rural areas were blocked, and book sales plummeted.

What to do? The staff of the county's Xinhua Bookstore were very anxious about this. They conducted investigations in rural areas and found that some township cultural and educational departments planned to set up their own textbook distribution centers. Thus, with the support of the county's Propaganda Department, the county bookstore collaborated with township cultural and educational departments to establish Cultural and Educational Bookstores in Huangji, Yidu, and Shenkou Townships in 1983. That year, the three bookstores each achieved book sales of more than 100,000 yuan. The new sprout of rural book distribution—the Cultural and Educational Bookstore—thus thrived on the land nourished by the Mahe River.

During the interview, Zhang Yushuang, a comrade from the county's Propaganda Department, listed the favorable conditions for establishing Cultural and Educational Bookstores. First, township cultural and educational departments were enthusiastic about setting up bookstores, finding a way to practice thrift and hard work. Second, Cultural and Educational Bookstores mainly sell textbooks, with guaranteed sales and significant economic benefits. For example, last year, the township Cultural and Educational Bookstores sold textbooks and books worth more than 1.6 million yuan, and the Cultural and Educational Bookstores actually earned more than 160,000 yuan, which was beneficial to the township cultural and educational undertakings. Third, Cultural and Educational Bookstores received support from township party and government organs, with personnel, venues, and funds all assisted by township party and government organs. The county bookstore did not need to increase personnel and funds. For example, the Liupan Township Party Committee actively chose a venue for the Cultural and Educational Bookstore and solved the problem of circulating funds. The Qian Sun Township Committee also assisted in the construction of the Cultural and Educational Bookstore's street-facing shop. The book distribution personnel were mostly teachers or cultural and educational secretaries of township party and government organs. At this point, Zhang Yushuang sighed, "A few years ago, rural book distribution was cold and desolate, but in just a few years, the situation has changed dramatically. It seems that relying on social forces to set up bookstores has great potential!"

At the beginning, many Cultural and Educational Bookstores were reluctant to sell general books. The county bookstore guided them from an economic policy perspective, linking textbook sales with general book sales and implementing flexible discounts, i.e., providing more discounts to townships with higher per capita book purchases. The county bookstore also specially assigned two rural distribution guidance personnel to work full-time in rural areas, helping township Cultural and Educational Bookstores and other bookstores with procurement and sales business, transmitting book information, and helping them solve practical problems such as adjusting surplus and deficient books. Through the county bookstore's persistent efforts, these active Cultural and Educational Bookstores in rural areas not only distribute textbooks in a timely and accurate manner but also proactively and enthusiastically distribute other books. Recently, the county bookstore contacted Beijing Jindun Publishing House and ordered 60 kinds of scientific and technological books, including "Scientific Wealth for Farmers" and "Fast Pig Raising Methods," totaling 6,500 copies.

While book sales in many rural areas are sluggish, the book sales of Cultural and Educational Bookstores here continue to rise year by year.

    马颊河畔遍书香
    ——陵县文教书店为农村图书发行闯新路
    吴功伟　毛鹏
    鲁北平原北端的陵县是一个有着悠久历史和革命传统的古城。但是历史的荣光未能掩盖现实的贫困。直到改革开放犹如春风乍起，使古老的马颊河两岸大地开始躁动了。图书发行事业也被赋予“文化科技使者”的新含义。一支活跃于马颊河两岸广大乡镇地区的图书发行新旅——文教书店应运而生了。
    陵县的文教书店是从1983年开始创建的，几年来已经扩展到20余家。这些文教书店去年共销售课本和各类图书160多万元，占全县图书销售额的63％，不仅解决了全县52所中小学10万余学生春秋两季课前到书的难题，而且力求满足陵县群众在发展工农业生产和发展乡镇企业中对文化科技知识和经济信息的需求。经过实践，文教书店为农村图书发行开创了一条新路。
    陵县55万人口，其中农业人口占90％以上。过去，农村图书发行主要依靠供销社。但自实行承包责任制以后，由于经营图书赢利甚微，供销社几乎普遍削减或取消了图书经营，以致后来全县24个供销社，只剩下6个还设有售书点。正值广大农村需要图书提供科技知识、管理知识为发展经济插翅添翼的关键时刻，农村图书发行渠道却出现堵塞，图书销售额大幅度下降。
    怎么办？县新华书店人员为此十分焦虑。他们深入农村调查，发现有些乡镇文教部门有意筹划自办课本发行。于是，在县委宣传部的支持下，县书店于1983年配合乡镇文教部门在黄集、义渡、神头乡办起了文教书店，当年这3处书店的图书发行额都分别达到万元以上。农村图书发行的新苗——文教书店就这样在马颊河滋润的土地上茁壮成长了。
    采访中，县委宣传部的张玉双同志向我们历数创办文教书店的有利条件，一是乡镇文教部门有办书店的积极性，他们借此找到了勤工俭学的路子。二是文教书店主要发行课本，销售有保证，经济效益显著。如去年各乡镇文教书店销售课本和图书达160多万元，文教书店实际创收16万多元，对乡镇文教事业不无补益。三是文教书店得到了乡镇党政机关的支持，人员、场地、资金都由乡镇党政机关协助解决，县书店无须增加人员和资金。如刘泮乡党委就主动给文教书店选择场地，解决流动资金。前孙镇委也协助修建文教书店临街门市部。图书发行员则大多由教师或乡镇党政机关文教秘书兼任。谈到这里，张玉双颇为感慨：“几年前农村图书发行冷冷清清，不过几年功夫，面貌为之一变，看来，依靠社会力量办书店，大有可为啊！”
    开始时许多文教书店不愿发行一般图书，县书店从经济政策上加以引导，让课本发行与一般图书发行挂钩，实行弹性折扣，即对人均购书额较大的乡镇实行多折扣。县书店还专设两名农村发行辅导员、常年活动在农村，帮助乡镇文教书店和其它售书点搞进销业务，传递图书信息，帮助他们解决调剂余缺图书等实际问题。经过县书店坚持不懈的努力，这些活跃在农村的文教书店现在不仅发行课本及时准确，而且发行其它书籍也一样主动积极。前不久，县书店与北京金盾出版社联系，订购了该社出版的《农家科学致富》、《快速养猪法》等科技书60多种、6500多册。
    当图书销售在农村许多地方不景气的情况下，这里文教书店的图书销售额却逐年上升。
