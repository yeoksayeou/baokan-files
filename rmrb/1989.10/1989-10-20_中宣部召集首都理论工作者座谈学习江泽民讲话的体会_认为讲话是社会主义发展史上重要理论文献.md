Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 19th.

The Propaganda Department's Theoretical Bureau on the 18th invited a number of theoretical and propaganda workers from the capital to discuss Jiang Zemin's speech at the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The experts and scholars present unanimously agreed that Jiang Zemin's speech is not only a guiding document for unifying the Party's thoughts and directing current work, but also an important theoretical document in the history of socialism.

Professor Zheng Hangsheng from Renmin University of China said in the discussion that Jiang Zemin's speech consistently emphasizes the line of adhering to the socialist path. He said that China must adhere to the socialist path to achieve the four modernizations. Pursuing capitalism cannot realize the common prosperity of the people but will only lead to a situation where a small number of capitalists become rich at the expense of the majority. He said that one characteristic of bourgeois liberalization is advocating absolute individual freedom and opposing all government interventions. If this trend continues, China will not be able to solve the huge population pressure and employment problems, and the four modernizations will be out of the question.

Vice Secretary-General Lu Zhichao of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference said that a large part of Jiang Zemin's speech reaffirmed the series of lines, policies, and principles established by the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, including the Twelfth and Thirteenth National Congresses. At the same time, it corrects the errors that have deviated from the Party's lines and policies over a period of time, so it can be said to be a rectification of the fundamentals. He said that our Party has never wavered in its commitment to socialism. Currently, the world is in an era of peace and development, and under these circumstances, people are prone to complacency and relaxation in ideological struggles. However, the struggle between capitalism and socialism, including subversion and counter-subversion, infiltration and counter-infiltration, and "peaceful evolution" and counter-evolution, has never diminished. In the current international context, Jiang Zemin's speech has special significance.

Professor Wang Jun from the Central Party School said that Jiang Zemin's speech unifies the Party's thoughts from both theoretical and practical aspects and has strong practical relevance. He said that the current focus should be on distinguishing between socialist reform and opening up and bourgeois liberalization-style reform and opening up. From a theoretical perspective, adhering to socialist reform and opening up means adhering to the basic nature of socialist production relations and reforming those specific forms that hinder the development of productive forces. If the basic nature and fundamental system of socialism are changed under the name of reform and opening up, it is a capitalist reform and opening up. He said that Jiang Zemin's proposal in the speech that the current rectification and deepening of reform should not be separated has more practical significance. In the past period, our country's reform mainly involved decentralization and micro-level activation, which is correct, but macro-control was insufficient. Rectification and deepening of reform means strengthening macro-control to match micro-level activation, which is both rectification and reform.

Professor Zhao Yao from the Central Party School said that Jiang Zemin's speech emphasizes the importance of long-term struggle against "peaceful evolution." The hostile forces of international socialism proposed the "containment policy" in the 1920s, the "peaceful evolution" strategy in the 1950s, and recently the "beyond containment" strategy, indicating that they have never abandoned their fundamental stance of hostility and subversion towards the socialist system. At the same time, because most socialist countries were built on the basis of economic backwardness, coupled with their own mistakes, the superiority of the socialist system has not been fully demonstrated, and there is still a significant gap in economic development compared to developed countries. Therefore, they all face the question of how to adhere to socialism. Many socialist countries, in order to rapidly develop productive forces, are currently undergoing reforms. Under these circumstances, the hostile forces of socialism will inevitably attempt to bring the reform onto the track of capitalistization, thereby achieving the goal of "peaceful evolution." Currently, there is a trend in the international socialist movement that is developing in the direction of "peaceful evolution." Therefore, the struggle against "peaceful evolution" is a major issue that determines the historical fate of the socialist system.

Deputy Director General Jiang Siyi of the Academy of Military Sciences said in his speech that the People's Liberation Army bears the dual functions of defending against external aggression and internal subversion. In the current international climate, it is particularly important to recognize the importance of the people's army. We should firmly adhere to the principle of the Party commanding the gun and the Party's leadership in the army, which does not contradict the fact that the People's Liberation Army is the armed forces of the state.

Director General Jin Huiming of the Propaganda Department's Theoretical Bureau said at the end of the discussion that Jiang Zemin's speech is not only of great significance to China's reform and opening up and the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also has important international significance in the current context of capitalist powers vigorously promoting "peaceful evolution" and attempting to subvert the socialist system. He hopes that the propaganda and theoretical circles will, in the process of seriously studying Jiang Zemin's speech, deeply research, expound, and propagate the series of important theoretical viewpoints proposed in the speech, thereby elevating the study of the speech to a higher level.

    中宣部召集首都理论工作者座谈学习江泽民讲话的体会
    认为讲话是社会主义发展史上重要理论文献
    新华社北京10月19日电　中宣部理论局18日邀集首都部分理论和宣传工作者座谈江泽民同志在庆祝国庆四十周年大会上的讲话。到会的专家学者一致认为，江泽民同志的讲话不仅是统一全党思想、指导当前工作的纲领性文件，同时也是社会主义发展史上的重要理论文献。
    中国人民大学郑杭生教授在座谈中说，江泽民同志的讲话始终贯穿了坚持社会主义道路的主线。他说，中国要实现四个现代化就必须坚持社会主义道路，搞资本主义不可能实现人民共同富裕的愿望，却只能导致用大多数人的血汗养肥一个人数不多的资产阶级。他说，资产阶级自由化的一个特点是提倡绝对的个人自由，反对政府一切干预。如果照此发展，中国将无法解决巨大的人口压力和就业问题，四个现代化也就无从谈起。
    全国政协副秘书长卢之超说，江泽民同志的讲话中很大部分是重申了党的十一届三中全会以来，包括党的十二大和十三大制定的一系列路线、方针、政策，同时也对一段时间以来偏离了党的路线和方针的错误加以纠正，因此可以说是一次正本清源。他说，我们党从来就没有对社会主义有过丝毫动摇。目前世界正处于和平与发展的时代，在这种情况下，人们容易在意识形态的斗争方面麻痹和松懈，而实际上资本主义和社会主义之间颠覆与反颠覆，渗透与反渗透，“和平演变”与反演变的斗争从来就没淡化过。在目前这种大的国际背景下，江泽民同志的讲话更具有特殊的意义。
    中央党校王珏教授说，江泽民同志的讲话从理论和实践两个方面统一了全党的思想，有很强的现实针对性。他说，当前应着重划清坚持社会主义的改革开放与资产阶级自由化式的改革开放的界限。他说，从理论上讲，坚持社会主义的改革开放就是坚持社会主义生产关系的基本性质，改革生产关系中那些束缚生产力发展的具体形式。如果借改革开放的名义改掉社会主义的基本性质和根本制度，那就是资本主义化的改革开放。他说，江泽民同志在讲话中提出不能将当前的治理整顿与深化改革割裂开来，更具有现实意义。过去一段时间，我国的改革主要是让利放权，微观搞活，这是对的，但宏观控制不够。治理整顿就是要加强宏观调控，使之与微观搞活相配套，这既是整顿，也是改革。
    中央党校赵曜教授说，江泽民同志讲话中提出要长期进行反
  “和平演变”的斗争，这个问题很重要。国际上社会主义的敌对势力，在二十年代搞过“遏制方针”，五十年代提出“和平演变”战略，最近又提出“超越遏制”战略，说明他们从未放弃敌视和颠覆社会主义制度的根本立场。同时，由于社会主义国家大都是在经济落后的基础上建成的，加上本身工作的失误，社会主义制度的优越性未能充分发挥，在经济上与发达国家相比还有较大差距，因此都面临着如何坚持社会主义的问题。不少社会主义国家为了迅速发展生产力，正在进行改革。在这种情况下，社会主义的敌对势力必然企图将改革纳入资本主义化的轨道，从而达到“和平演变”的目的。目前国际社会主义运动中已经出现了一股沿“和平演变”方向发展的逆流。因此，进行反“和平演变”的斗争，是决定社会主义制度历史命运的大事。
    军事科学院副院长姜思毅在发言中谈到，人民解放军肩负着对外反侵略，对内反颠覆的双重职能，在当前的国际大气候下，认识人民军队的重要性尤为重要。我们应该坚定不移地坚持党指挥枪的原则，坚持党在军队的领导地位，这同人民解放军是国家的武装力量并不矛盾。
    中宣部理论局局长靳辉明在座谈结束时说，江泽民同志的讲话不仅对我国的改革开放和建设有中国特色的社会主义具有重要的意义，而且在当前资本主义大国大肆鼓吹“和平演变”，妄图颠覆社会主义制度的国际大背景下，也具有重要的国际意义。他希望宣传理论界的同志在认真学习江泽民同志讲话的过程中，要深入研究、阐发和宣传讲话中提出的一系列重要理论观点，从而把对讲话的学习上升到一个更高的水平。
