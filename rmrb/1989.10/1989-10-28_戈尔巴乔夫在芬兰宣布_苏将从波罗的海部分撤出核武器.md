Our reporter Guo Yaoming reports from Helsinki: The Soviet leader Gorbachev announced today that, in order to make the Baltic Sea a nuclear-free zone, the Soviet Union will unilaterally withdraw part of its sea-based nuclear weapons from the Baltic Sea.

Gorbachev made this announcement this afternoon during a speech at the Finnish Hall. He said that the Soviet Union highly values Finland's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Northern Europe and urges the United States and other countries to change their previous stances and pay attention to this proposal. He mentioned that, to achieve this goal, the Soviet Union's tactical nuclear weapons have already been deployed in areas where they cannot reach Northern Europe. Additionally, by the end of 1990, all six G-class nuclear missile submarines in the Baltic Sea will be withdrawn, and the nuclear missiles carried by these submarines will be destroyed, with no new nuclear weapons being deployed. The Soviet Union will begin negotiations with all nuclear powers and Baltic Sea countries to reach an agreement on effectively ensuring that the Baltic Sea becomes a nuclear-free zone.

Gorbachev also proposed that the heads of state of the 35 member countries of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) hold a second summit in Helsinki in 1992 to discuss the current situation and future of European affairs.

He stated in his speech: "Our next task will be to develop a common economic foundation for Europe."

He suggested forming a "European Tripartite Committee" consisting of experts from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), the European Economic Community (EEC), and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) to coordinate and solve common economic problems faced by European countries.

Today is the second day of Gorbachev's visit to Finland. In the morning, Gorbachev met with Finnish Prime Minister Holkeri. In the afternoon, the Finnish and Soviet delegations held formal talks. President Koivisto and Gorbachev signed a joint statement. Additionally, the two sides signed nearly 30 agreements, including the Finland-Soviet 1991-1995 trade framework agreement, environmental protection agreement, and an agreement regarding the establishment of a Finnish cultural and technological center in Moscow.

The Xinhua News Agency reports from Helsinki: The joint statement signed by the leaders of Finland and the Soviet Union this afternoon advocates for the second highest-level meeting of the CSCE to be held in Helsinki in 1992.

The statement was signed by Soviet leader Gorbachev and Finnish President Koivisto.

The statement points out that the conditions for improving European and international relations are being formed, and this easing trend is conducive to creating a more just and democratic world, free from nuclear weapons and the threat of force.

Regarding economic issues, the statement urges European and other countries to prevent further widening of the gap in economic development and to achieve balanced economic growth. The statement also emphasizes the improvement of global and regional economic systems, noting that the development and exchange of environmentally friendly technologies are the shared responsibility of all countries.
