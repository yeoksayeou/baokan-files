The meeting on the rectification and clean-up of companies has made deployments: the focus for the rest of the year is to shut down and merge companies and investigate major cases.

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th — Reporter Pí Shùyì reports: Companies that should be shut down or merged must be resolutely shut down or merged, and illegal and disciplinary cases involving companies must be promptly investigated. The national meeting on the rectification and clean-up of companies, which opened today, has made deployments for further rectification and clean-up of companies: by the end of this year, all regions and departments should focus on shutting down and merging companies and investigating major cases.

	Material supply, commercial wholesale, foreign trade companies, and financial companies, as well as companies run by party and government organs, are the key targets for this round of rectification, clean-up, and shutdown or merger. The national leading group for the rectification and clean-up of companies requires that all regions and departments formulate plans for the shutdown, merger, and retention of companies at all levels and of all types. These plans must be strictly controlled and reviewed one by one, and companies that should be shut down or merged must be resolutely shut down or merged.

	Efforts must be made to promptly investigate illegal and disciplinary issues involving companies. Special teams should be organized to conduct targeted investigations in key units, with a particular focus on investigating major cases. The investigation of illegal and disciplinary issues should be combined with audits, tax, financial, and price inspections. For companies with illegal and disciplinary issues, even after they are shut down or merged, the relevant units must be held accountable for promptly investigating and clarifying the issues and handling them seriously, without any laxity.

	Efforts must be made to properly handle the aftermath of the shutdown or merger of companies, mainly involving the handling of assets, debts, and credits, the transfer of business and contracts, and particularly ensuring that foreign contracts are not affected. Employees of the shut-down or merged companies should be properly arranged. This meeting will discuss and clarify the relevant policies and regulations for the rectification and clean-up of companies.

	This meeting was convened by the national leading group for the rectification and clean-up of companies. State Council Secretary-General and Deputy Head of the national leading group for the rectification and clean-up of companies, Luó Gàn, presided over today's meeting. Attendees included relevant responsible persons from various provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and centrally planned cities, as well as relevant departments of the central government. The Ministry of Communications, Guangming Daily, Hubei Province, and Hunan Province shared their experiences in rectifying and cleaning up companies.
