Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 13th. Reported by Xinhua News Agency reporter Fu Gang and People's Daily reporter Zhang Jinli: The head of the National Audit Office met with reporters today and pointed out that current audit work should focus on reducing the scale of fixed asset investments, cleaning up and rectifying companies, and strengthening supervision in areas such as taxation, finance, and pricing.

According to the responsible person, the current audit work has five key areas:

	— Further improving the tracking audit of halted and suspended fixed asset investment projects. Generally, projects decided to be halted or suspended by the government should complete the tracking audit within two months after the notice is issued. Currently, audit agencies at all levels should work with relevant departments to investigate and deal with construction units that do not comply with the halt and suspension decisions and continue construction. According to the relevant notices of the State Council, audits should also be conducted on whether the funds for resuming construction of halted and suspended projects and new projects are in place and whether the sources of funds are legitimate.

	— Strengthening the audit of companies in the circulation sector. Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council pointed out that the previous cleanup and rectification of companies has not achieved the expected results. In this regard, audit agencies at all levels should focus on auditing some companies in the circulation sector, strictly investigate and deal with illegal and disciplinary issues in their operations according to the law, and supervise and assist in establishing internal audit institutions and improving audit systems.

	— Strengthening the audit of consumption funds. Currently, the growth rate of consumption funds remains high. Audit agencies at all levels should urgently check whether enterprises falsely report profits and losses, squeeze operating costs, and misappropriate production development funds to expand consumption funds.

	— Strengthening the audit of special funds for agricultural development and poverty alleviation. This year, various places have conducted audits on special funds for grain production development, poverty alleviation and rural support, and urban vegetable land construction, and found issues of misappropriation and embezzlement. In this regard, relevant regulations should be followed, with funds to be recovered where necessary, fines to be imposed where appropriate, and legal responsibility to be pursued for serious cases.

	— Continuing to audit financial and banking departments, timely reflecting newly discovered problems, and promoting the strengthening of macro-management.

    审计署负责人提出当前审计五个重点
    本报北京10月13日讯　新华社记者傅刚、本报记者张锦力报道：审计署负责人今天约见记者时指出，当前审计工作要紧紧围绕压缩固定资产投资规模、清理整顿公司和税收、财务、物价大检查加强监督作用。
    据这位负责人介绍，当前审计工作的重点有五个方面：
    ——进一步搞好对固定资产投资停缓建项目的跟踪审计。凡是政府决定停缓建的项目，一般要在通知下达后两个月内完成跟踪审计。当前各级审计机关要配合有关部门，对不执行停缓建决定、继续施工的项目建设单位进行查处。根据国务院有关通知，对停缓建项目恢复建设和新开工项目资金是否落实，资金来源是否正当，也要进行审计。
    ——加强对流通领域的公司的审计。最近，党中央和国务院指出，前一段的清理整顿公司工作远没有取得预期效果。对此，各级审计机关要有重点地审计一些流通领域的公司，依法严肃查处经营中的违法违纪问题，并督促和帮助建立内部审计机构、健全审计制度。
    ——加强对消费基金的审计。目前消费基金增长速度仍然居高不下。各级审计机关要抓紧检查企业有无虚报盈亏、挤占成本费用、挪用生产发展基金等扩大消费基金的问题。
    ——加强对发展农业和扶贫专项资金的审计。今年以来，各地对发展粮食生产、扶贫支农、城市新菜地建设等专项资金进行了审计，查出一些挤占挪用和贪污私分的问题。对此，要依照有关规定，该收缴的收缴，该罚款的罚款，情节严重的要依法追究责任人的责任。
    ——继续对财政、金融部门进行审计，及时反映新发现的问题，促进加强宏观管理。
