From October 1st to 9th, the 1989 World Women's Tennis Team Competition, known as the Federation Cup, was held in Tokyo. A total of 140 athletes from 40 countries and regions participated in the event. Among the world's three major team tennis competitions, the Federation Cup is the highest-level competition for women's tennis. This year's competition saw all the top 10 ranked women tennis players, except for Argentina's Sabatini, participate, providing spectators with an opportunity to witness the highest level of women's team tennis.

The upper half of the main draw featured several strong teams, including West Germany, Czechoslovakia, and the United States, all vying for a spot in the final. West Germany's tennis queen Graf stood out alone, but it was not enough, as she lost 1-2 to the defending champions, Czechoslovakia, in the quarterfinals. The Czechoslovak team, featuring world-ranked No. 8 and No. 11 singles players Skova and Novotna, along with a well-coordinated doubles pair, unfortunately faced the stronger American team in the semifinals.

The American team consisted of 32-year-old Navratilova and 34-year-old Evert, who were ranked No. 2 and No. 4 in the world, respectively. They were the strongest and oldest team in this year's competition. The Czechoslovak team, facing such formidable opponents, could only hope to win one singles match and rely on the doubles to decide the outcome. The Czechoslovak team's No. 1 player, Skova, who had defeated Navratilova multiple times in recent years, was hampered by a leg injury this time, significantly reducing her strength. As a result, she lost both singles matches to the American team without having the chance to fully display her skills.

In the lower half of the draw, there were fewer strong teams. The Spanish team advanced to the final relatively easily, facing the American team for the championship. Although the American team was technically superior, Navratilova faced a tough challenge from Sanchez, making the American team sweat. The "baseline fighter" Sanchez seemed to have thoroughly studied her opponent's "net-rushing" style, winning the first set without losing a game, forcing her opponent to hesitate before going to the net again. Sanchez's change in tactics caught Navratilova off guard, and combined with her eagerness to win, Sanchez made more mistakes, losing the next two sets. The American team, after 1986, regained the Federation Cup, winning the championship for the 13th time, demonstrating their strong team strength.

Since 1981, the Chinese team has participated in the Federation Cup nine times. This time, they played the most matches, losing to one of the top four teams, Australia, in the second round of the main draw. In the B-group competition, they reached the third round and faced Sweden. The two singles matches ended in a tie, and the doubles also ended in a tie after the first two sets, losing the third set 4-6. Experts believe that the Chinese young players, with an average age of less than 18, have made significant progress in recent years, and their ball speed is no slower than that of Western players. Due to participating in fewer international competitions, their experience is obviously insufficient, and they cannot seize key opportunities. In the world of tennis, they are still considered a developing country, with their main Asian rivals being Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea. As long as China starts with young players, trains effectively, and participates in more competitions, there will be Chinese stars in the world of tennis in the future.

    世界女子网球团体赛纵横谈
    本报记者　于青
    从10月1日到9日，争夺联合会杯的1989年世界女子网球团体赛在东京举行。来自40个国家和地区的140名选手参加了比赛。在世界网球三大团体赛中，联合会杯赛是女子网球最高级别的比赛。今年的比赛中，除阿根廷的萨巴蒂尼外，世界女网排名前10位选手全部出场，为观众提供了检阅当今女网团体最高水平的机会。
    正选赛的上半区强队较多。西德、捷克斯洛伐克和美国队等争夺决赛权。西德队的网球女王格拉芙一花独秀，孤掌难鸣，在1／4决赛中以1∶2负于上届冠军捷克斯洛伐克队。捷队由世界排名第8位和第11位的斯科娃和诺波特娜为单打选手，加上配合默契的双打对子，无奈在半决赛中撞上实力更强的美国队。
    美国队由32岁的纳芙拉蒂诺娃和34岁的埃弗特组成。两人在世界排名中分别列第2和第4位，是本次参赛平均实力最强、年龄最大的代表队。捷队与之对阵自然凶多吉少，只希望在单打中拿下一分，靠双打决出胜负。捷队第一号选手斯科娃近年多次战胜纳芙拉蒂诺娃，这次对阵因腿部有伤，实力大减，导致两盘单打皆负于美国队，未等发挥实力就失去决赛权。
    下半区中强队不多。西班牙队比较轻松地进入决赛，与美国队争夺冠军。虽然美国队技高一筹，但纳芙拉蒂诺娃面临桑切斯顽强的挑战，也使美国队手握冷汗。“底线拚搏型”的桑切斯似乎充分研究了对手“上网紧逼型”的打法，第一盘未输一局取胜，迫使对手不敢再轻易上网。桑切斯对纳芙拉蒂诺娃改变打法反倒不能适应，加之求胜心切，失误增多，连输两盘。美国队经1986年后，再次夺回联合会杯，第13次夺得这项比赛的冠军，显示了雄厚的团体实力。
    中国队继1981年以来9次参加联合会杯赛，这次比赛打的场次最多，在正选赛第二轮负于本次比赛4强之一的澳大利亚队。在乙组比赛中进入第三轮与瑞典对阵。两盘单打一胜一负，双打前两盘又是一胜一负，第三盘以4∶6失利。行家认为，平均年龄不到18岁的中国小将近年进步不小，球速已不慢于西方选手。由于参加国际比赛偏少，经验明显不足，把握不住关键机会，在世界网坛上还属于发展中国家，在亚洲的主要对手是印尼、日本和南朝鲜队。中国网球只要从少年抓起，训练得法，经常参赛，将来世界网坛明星中也会有中国人的名字。
