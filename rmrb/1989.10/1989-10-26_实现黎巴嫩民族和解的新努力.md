After 23 days of repeated discussions and consultations, the Lebanese parliament meeting held in the western Saudi Arabian city of Taif finally passed the national reconciliation document on the evening of the 22nd. On the 24th, the Lebanese parliament formally announced the achievement of the Lebanese National Reconciliation Charter at its closing meeting. This is a difficult step taken by the Lebanese people towards achieving national reconciliation.

The main content of the Lebanese national reconciliation document is as follows: The reconciliation government will exercise sovereignty in Lebanon within one year through the country's regular armed forces; disband all factional militias; acknowledge the "special brotherly relationship" between Syria and Lebanon, with Syrian troops helping Lebanon restore its sovereignty over two years, and after the election of the president, the establishment of the reconciliation government and the implementation of political reforms, Syrian troops will withdraw to the Bekaa Valley. Thereafter, the duration and number of Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon will be determined separately.

The Taif meeting was held according to a peace plan proposed by the Arab League's three-party committee for mediating the Lebanese crisis (Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Algeria) on September 30. Participants in the Taif meeting included 33 Christian deputies and 30 Muslim deputies from Lebanon. These deputies, who had experienced 15 years of civil war, finally sat together to replace "dialogue of cannons" with negotiations and consultations, and passed the national reconciliation document, which demonstrated the desire of all parties in Lebanon to seek national reconciliation.

Surrounding the two key issues of Syrian troop withdrawal and Lebanese political reform, the two factions of Lebanese deputies had serious differences at the Taif meeting. According to an unwritten agreement at the time of Lebanon's independence in 1943, the positions of prime minister and speaker of the parliament were to be held by Sunni and Shia Muslims respectively, while the Maronite Christians, who then constituted the majority of the population, held the presidency and dominated the government, military, parliament, and judicial system. However, with the growth and changes in the population, Muslims now make up 55% of Lebanon's 4 million people. Therefore, in recent years, the calls for political reform from the Muslim factions have been growing louder. Muslim deputies at the meeting demanded that political reforms be carried out first domestically. The leader of the Shia Muslim "Amal" movement in Lebanon, Berri, said that the current political system is the root cause of Lebanon's disaster. The positions of the head of state and other government positions must be held in turn by various factions. Only after complete political reform and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon can Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon. The Syrian government also explicitly stated that it would not withdraw troops until the Christian factions agreed to share power with the Muslim factions.

Christian deputies, on the other hand, insisted on the withdrawal of Syrian troops within six months, after which the reform issue would be discussed. The head of the Christian military government, Oron, had repeatedly stated that there would be no bargaining on the issue of sovereignty, and that any political reform would be useless under the condition of Lebanon being occupied. Due to the insistence of both sides on their positions, the Taif meeting had twice reached an impasse, even facing the danger of collapse. With the mediation of Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal and the efforts of both sides' deputies, the meeting finally reached the above document.

After the national reconciliation document was passed, the Muslim cabinet led by Hus expressed welcome, but the Shia "Amal" militia and "Hezbollah" considered the allocation of seats unfair and expressed opposition. The head of the Christian military government, Oron, criticized the document for not proposing a timetable for the complete withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, emphasizing that the part of the document concerning Lebanese sovereignty was also unacceptable, and ordered his armed forces to be on alert in case of emergencies. This indicates that although the Taif meeting has finally pushed Lebanon towards national reconciliation after many twists and turns, due to some fundamental contradictions that have not been truly resolved, the road to national reconciliation in Lebanon remains tortuous and difficult.

　　实现黎巴嫩民族和解的新努力
　　温宪
    经过23天的反复讨论和磋商，在沙特阿拉伯西部城市塔伊夫举行的黎巴嫩议会会议终于在22日晚通过了全国和解文件。24日，黎巴嫩议会在闭幕会议上正式宣布达成黎巴嫩全国和解宪章。这是黎巴嫩人民为实现民族和解迈出的艰难一步。
    黎巴嫩全国和解文件的主要内容是：和解政府在1年内依靠国家正规部队在黎行使主权；解散各派武装；承认叙利亚与黎巴嫩的“特殊兄弟关系”，叙军在两年内帮助黎恢复主权，在选出总统、建立和解政府和实行政治改革后，叙军撤至黎贝卡谷地。此后，叙军在黎境内的驻扎时间和人数另行商定。
    塔伊夫会议是按照阿拉伯联盟调解黎巴嫩危机三方委员会（沙特阿拉伯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚）提出的一项和平计划于9月30日开始举行的。参加塔伊夫会议的有黎巴嫩基督教派的33名议员和穆斯林方面的30名议员。这些经历了15年内战的议员们终于坐在一起，以谈判磋商取代“大炮对话”，并通过了全国和解文件，这表现了黎巴嫩有关各方寻求民族和解的愿望。
    围绕叙利亚撤军和黎巴嫩政治改革这两个关键问题，黎巴嫩两派议员在塔伊夫会议上分歧严重。按照黎巴嫩1943年独立时一项不成文的规定，总理和议长职务分别由穆斯林逊尼派和穆斯林什叶派担任，而当时在人口中占多数的基督教马龙派则担任总统一职，并在政府、军队、议会和司法部门中居于支配地位。然而，随着人口的增长和变化，现在穆斯林已占黎巴嫩400万人口的55％。因此，近年来穆斯林派要求政治改革的呼声日渐高涨。穆斯林派议员在会议上要求首先在国内进行政治改革。黎穆斯林什叶派“阿迈勒”运动领导人贝里说，现行政治体制是黎巴嫩灾难的根源。国家首脑的职务和政府其他职务必须由各派轮流担任。只有在完全实行政治改革和以色列从黎巴嫩南部撤军后，叙利亚军队才能撤出黎巴嫩。叙利亚官方也明确表示，在基督教派同意与穆斯林派平分权力之前绝不撤军。
    基督教派议员则坚持要求叙军在6个月内撤出黎巴嫩，然后再谈改革问题。基督教派军政府首脑奥恩曾数次表示，在主权问题上不允许讨价还价，在黎巴嫩被占领的情况下，任何政治改革都是无用的。由于双方坚持各自立场，致使塔伊夫会议曾两度陷于僵局，甚至面临破裂的危险。在沙特外交大臣费萨尔亲王等的斡旋和双方议员的努力下，会议才得以达成上述文件。
    全国和解文件通过后，胡斯所领导的穆斯林派内阁表示欢迎，但什叶派“阿迈勒”民兵和“真主党”则认为议席分配不公而表示反对。基督教派军政府首脑奥恩批评文件没有提出叙利亚军队全部撤出黎巴嫩的时间表，强调文件中有关黎巴嫩主权部分也是不能接受的，并命令其武装力量处于戒备状态以备不测。这表明，尽管几经周折，塔伊夫会议终于推动黎巴嫩向民族和解方向迈出了一步，但由于一些基本矛盾并没有获得真正解决，黎巴嫩实现民族和解的道路仍是曲折和艰难的。
