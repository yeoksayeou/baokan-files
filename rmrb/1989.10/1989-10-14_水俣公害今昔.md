Japanese Kyushu has a Kumamoto Prefecture, and within Kumamoto Prefecture, there is a place called Minamata. When one mentions Minamata, people immediately think of Minamata Disease. This small town, originally unknown, once became famous worldwide due to a shocking case of environmental pollution.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, Minamata discovered a strange illness: many people suffered from movement disorders, stiff limbs; slow eye movements, narrowed vision; speech and hearing impairments, clouded consciousness, mental confusion, and many were left permanently disabled. During this period, thousands of people fell ill, and hundreds died. Additionally, the strange disease affected fish and cats, with large numbers of marine life suffocating to death, and usually docile house cats suddenly becoming aggressive. This disease, caused by mercury poisoning and affecting the nervous system, was named "Minamata Disease."

Minamata is a coastal town nestled between mountains and the sea, where residents have long relied on agriculture, forestry, and fishing for their livelihood. At the beginning of the 20th century, the tide of industrialization swept through, and a chemical company established a factory here. From then on, Minamata became inextricably linked with this nitrogen factory. As the factory prospered, Minamata quickly developed into a modern chemical industrial city. However, no one could have predicted that the nitrogen factory, which brought prosperity to Minamata, would also plant the seeds of disaster. During the production of acetaldehyde, the factory used organic mercury as a catalyst. From the start of production in 1928 until it ceased in 1968, over a hundred tons of mercury flowed into Minamata Bay with the wastewater. The sediment in the deepest part of the bay, with a mercury concentration of over 25 ppm, accumulated to a depth of 4 meters.

The mercury pollution brought devastating consequences to Minamata. The local government reported that a city originally with a population of 50,000 now has 15,000 people applying for recognition as Minamata Disease sufferers, of whom 2,200 have been officially recognized, and 400 have died. The city's population has also been decreasing yearly, now down to 36,000. More seriously, apart from the first generation of Minamata Disease sufferers, there are still potential sufferers, affecting future generations.

The nitrogen factory is the main culprit in causing the pollution, but it is also Minamata's primary industry. The factory cannot close, but it must also compensate the victims, for which it has already incurred a debt of 100 billion yen.

Since 1977, Minamata City has begun the "Minamata Bay Pollution Prevention Project." Over more than ten years, 12.09 million square meters of highly concentrated mercury sludge, with a volume of approximately 1.51 million cubic meters, has been dredged from the bay. Simultaneously, 600,000 square meters of land has been reclaimed, and the mercury sludge has been solidified, sealed, and buried with a mixture of sand and stones, ensuring it will never leak out again. This project, costing nearly 50 billion yen, is jointly funded by the responsible factory and the national government. This unprecedented environmental restoration project in the world is nearing completion and is scheduled to be finished next spring. We saw on-site that the renovated bay no longer resembles its original state. The shoreline is neat and beautiful, the buried area is planted with grass and trees, and the wastewater flowing from the factory into the bay no longer contains organic mercury. The discharge standards strictly adhere to national environmental regulations. It is said that after the project is fully completed, a "Spirit Consolation Memorial Hall" will be built on the reclaimed land for the deceased victims. Additionally, an international conference on environmental protection will be held. The future Minamata will be a city of "flowers and greenery."

The Minamata City government has planned a beautiful future for the city's rebirth. However, Minamata Disease sufferers are still struggling in pain. In the _Meisui-en_ hospital treating the patients, 60 patients of varying degrees of severity still show no signs of recovery. According to a recent survey, the mercury concentration in the hair of local fishermen is, in some cases, tens of times higher than the average for Japanese people. Even after treatment, the mercury concentration in some underground water remains 33 times higher. For decades, the dispute between the patients and the factory over compensation has not been resolved. Vice Mayor Matsumoto said that Minamata City is not yet qualified to declare itself a "pollution-free city."

The lessons of the Minamata pollution are profound. It cries out to people: whoever destroys nature will be punished by nature. Any pollution should not be addressed only after it has caused a tragedy, as the cost will be much more painful.

    水俣公害今昔
    孙东民
    日本九州有个熊本县，熊本县有个地方叫水俣。一提到水俣，人们便联想起水俣病。这个原本并不知名的小城镇，曾因一桩令人震惊的公害名扬世界。
    60年代至70年代初，水俣发现一种怪病：不少人运动失调，手足僵直；眼球转动迟缓，视野也比较狭窄；言语、听觉出现障碍，意识混浊，神经错乱，许多人终生致残。这期间先后有数千人发病，数百人死亡。此外，怪病还殃及鱼、猫，大量海生物窒息死亡，温顺的家猫突然疯狂。这种因水银中毒而引起的神经系统的公害病，命名为“水俣病”。
    水俣依山傍水，原是海滨村镇，居民世代以农林渔业为生。本世纪初，工业化的浪潮冲到这里，一家化工公司在此设厂。从此，水俣与这家氮素工厂结下不解之缘，水俣随工厂的繁荣而繁荣，迅速发展成现代化学工业城市。但谁也没有料到，给水俣带来繁荣的氮素工厂却给它种下祸根。工厂在制造乙醛的过程中，使用有机水银作催化剂，到1968年停止生产乙醛为止的40年间，上百吨的水银随废水流进水俣湾，水银浓度为25ppm以上的污泥在湾内最深部积厚4米。
    水银公害给水俣带来了惨痛的恶果。市政当局说，一个原有5万人口的城市，迄今有1.5万人提出患水俣病的申请，其中有2200名正式认定为患者，有400人死亡。城市人口也因此逐年递减，目前减至3.6万人。更严重的是，除第一代的水俣病患者之外，还有潜在患者，累及子孙。
    氮素工厂是引发公害的主犯，但又是水俣的主干产业。工厂既不能倒闭，又要赔偿患者的损失，为此已背上1000亿日元的债务。
    从1977年起，水俣市开始了“水俣湾防止公害事业”。用10多年时间疏浚沉积在湾内1209万平米、容积约151万立米的高浓度水银污泥。同时填海60万平米，把水银污泥固化、密封，掺砂石混合掩埋，永远不使流出。这项工程耗资近500亿日元之巨，由肇事的工厂和国家分担。这项世界罕见的环境复原事业目前已近尾声，预定明年春季完工。我们在现场看到，整修过的海湾已不复原貌，岸壁整齐美观，掩埋地面种植着草木，从工厂流入海湾内的废水已无有机水银，排出标准严格按国家规定的环保标准监测。据说工程全部完工后，将在填海地为死去的患者建“慰灵纪念馆”，还将举办保护环境国际讨论会，未来的水俣将是一个“鲜花与绿色的城市”。
    水俣市政府为水俣的新生规划了美好的前景。但是水俣病的患者至今仍在痛苦中挣扎。在收治患者的《明水园》里，60名不同程度的患者依旧不见痊愈。据最近一项调查，当地渔民头发中的水银浓度，有的高出日本人的平均值十几倍，经过处理后的地下水的水银浓度，有的地方仍高出33倍。几十年来患者与厂方就赔偿问题的争议至今没有了结。小松副市长说，水俣市现在还没有资格发表“无公害城市宣言”。
    水俣公害带来的教训是深刻的。它向人们呼喊：谁破坏了大自然，谁就会受到大自然的惩罚。任何公害都不要等到酿成悲剧之后才想着治理，那要付出更惨痛的代价。
