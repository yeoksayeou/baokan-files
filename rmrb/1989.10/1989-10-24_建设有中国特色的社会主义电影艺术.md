During the first Chinese Film Festival, film creation and criticism personnel from all over the country gathered together to discuss some important creative issues in conjunction with the exhibition and award activities of the film festival. This is a necessary step to explore the development and prosperity of Chinese film art.

As a retired old soldier, I have not watched many films in recent years and am really unable to comment on the current situation and existing problems. However, I sincerely hope that starting from this conference, we can review history, face reality, and look to the future. We need to calmly think about how, from the fundamental premise of what constitutes socialist film art with Chinese characteristics, we can re-examine our film history and current status, and study how to leverage the advantages of film art.

The great achievements of Chinese cinema over the past forty years should be fully affirmed. These achievements were made through a long, arduous, tortuous, and bumpy journey. There are many valuable historical experiences, as well as painful lessons. There are already unique and excellent traditions, but due to the long-term influence of ideological stagnation, the exploitation of film characteristics is still insufficient and requires continuous exploration, innovation, and development. We must see that a small number of films have attracted attention and had a significant impact on the international film stage, but overall, our films are still far from meeting the demands of the times and the people, facing a severe test. The reasons are, of course, multifaceted and need to be further studied in conjunction with reforms.

In my opinion, we still need to correctly summarize historical experiences, face reality, and unify our understanding. How will we build and develop socialist film art with Chinese characteristics in the future? Does New China's cinema have its own unique color and style, forming excellent traditions? How do we carry forward these characteristics and form our advantages?

From my memory, over the past forty years, many of the excellent films we have shot, which have their own national characteristics, can be roughly divided into the following categories:

First, reflecting modern revolutionary historical themes, showcasing the revolutionary history and struggles of the Chinese nation, especially the long-term revolutionary wars of our party before the founding of the nation. This year's "The Founding Ceremony," "The Great Kunlun," and "The Baise Uprising" are sufficient proof.

Second, reflecting the achievements and mistakes in the construction of New China, themes related to the real life of the broad masses, especially those related to the disasters of the ten-year turmoil and reforms in the new period. However, the achievements in this area are not as great as in the first category. The reasons are also quite complex.

Third, adaptations of Chinese classical and modern literary classics. They not only reflect China's history, culture, and the lives of various ethnic groups at that time but also, because of the deep connotations, literary value, and vivid and typical character images of the literary works themselves, often achieve great success after adaptation. This year's "Dream of the Red Chamber" and past adaptations such as "The New Year's Sacrifice," "Lin's Shop," and "Camel Xiangzi" are obvious examples.

Fourth, the extremely rich historical themes of the Chinese nation over several thousand years that are yet to be explored. From "Lin Zexu" to "The Last Emperor," which had a broad impact and was quite controversial in China (co-produced with a foreign country).

These aspects are precisely the artistic characteristics of our country's films and are also our inexhaustible rich sources of creation. What I understand as Chinese characteristics is that, through the characteristics of film art, guided by Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, we reflect the glorious history of the Chinese nation, especially the fighting journey led by the Communist Party of China and the struggles since the founding of the nation. We walk our own path, have our own unique experiences and lessons; and we showcase the new people with new national spirits and characters formed with the progress of history, who strive forward without end. In artistic innovation, we closely link the continuous exploration of the expressive potential of film art with the absorption and integration of the excellent traditions unique to Chinese culture and art. Only by correctly understanding this characteristic can the mass nature of film art be correctly carried forward, and its special function in building socialist spiritual civilization can be exerted. This will make a greater contribution to improving the overall ideological and moral, scientific, and cultural quality of the nation and to cultivating a new generation of socialist people.

I have always believed that the more mass-oriented and widely influential an art form is, the more it should advocate what Comrade Zhou Enlai said, "Education through entertainment." We are moving towards modernization, but there are still two to three hundred million illiterates and semi-illiterates. If people's quality is not improved, it will be the biggest obstacle in our progress. In the past, education was simply reduced to political struggle, which was one-sided and simplistic. However, to deny any educational role in entertainment is also a bias. Ideology, morality, sentiment, cultural cultivation, aesthetic ability, historical knowledge, personal behavior norms, personal interests and hobbies, manners, respect for others, concern for others... In short, all the roles that art plays in shaping one's character, which have an impact on the physical and mental health development of the younger generation, actually contain educational elements. Moreover, art is more about "emotional education."

To belittle, ignore, or completely deny the educational significance and function of art often results in opening the door to vulgar, low-level, and even pornographic things. On the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, a historic and unprecedented "anti-pornography" campaign was launched nationwide. Shouldn't this make us reflect deeply?

Not long ago, I reread Premier Zhou's 1959 speech on "Let Literature and Art Walk on Two Legs," and I believe that the basic spirit and principles of this speech, combined with today's situation, are still a very relevant guiding ideology. Therefore, I believe that in film art creation, in implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, adhering to the four cardinal principles, opposing bourgeois liberalization, and building socialist spiritual civilization, how to develop and prosper in a healthier way is indeed a fundamental issue that needs to be considered.

What are the characteristics of our Chinese cinema? How do we walk this path and develop our unique experiences and traditions? How do we better adhere to the "two for" direction and the "hundred flowers, hundred schools" policy in the new period, avoiding the repetition of past mistakes? Emphasizing the "two for" direction while ignoring the "hundred flowers, hundred schools" policy, or emphasizing the "hundred flowers, hundred schools" while deviating from the "two for" direction? Truly grasping the central policies and learning to walk on two legs is very important.

　　建设有中国特色的社会主义电影艺术
　　陈荒煤
    中国第一届电影节期间，全国各地的一些创作评论人员能够齐聚一堂，结合电影节的展览与评奖活动，就一些重要创作问题交换意见，为中国电影艺术创作的发展和繁荣作些探讨，是十分必要的。
    我这个退役老兵，对近几年的电影看得不多，实在无法对当前的形势、存在的问题发表什么意见。但我衷心地期望从这次会议开始，回顾历史，面对现实，展望未来，冷静地思考一下，从到底什么是有中国特色的社会主义的电影这个大前提下，重新认识一下我们电影的历史和现状，研究如何发挥电影艺术的优势。
    中国电影四十年所取得的巨大成就，应该加以充分肯定，这是经历长期极为艰辛、曲折、坎坷的历程所取得的。这里既有许多宝贵的历史经验，又有悲痛的教训。既有已形成中国特有的优良传统，又限于长期思想僵化的影响，对电影特性的发挥还有所不足，还有待于不断的探索、创新和开拓。既要看到有很少量的影片在国际影坛引起重视，发生较大影响，又应该看到从总体来说，我们的电影还远远不能适应时代和人民的要求，面临严峻的考验。原因当然是多方面的，还得结合改革进一步研究。
    我个人认为，还是要正确地总结历史经验，面向现实，统一认识，我们今后到底如何建设和发展有中国特色的社会主义电影艺术，新中国的电影有没有自己独特的色彩和风格所形成的优良传统，我们如何发扬这些特点，形成我们的优势？
    就我回忆，四十年来，我们所拍摄的许多优秀而确有自己民族特色的影片，大体是以下几个方面的题材。
    一、反映现代革命历史题材，展现了中华民族革命历史和斗争，特别是我们党在建国以前长期革命战争中的战斗经历。今年的《开国大典》、《巍巍昆仑》、《百色起义》就足以证明。
    二、反映新中国建设中的成就和失误，为广大群众所关注的现实生活的题材，特别是有关十年动乱的灾难和新时期改革方面的题材。但这方面的成就不如前一方面大。原因也比较复杂。
    三、中国古典与现代文学名著的改编。它们既反映了中国的历史、文化、当时各民族人民的生活，又因为文学作品本身深厚的内涵、文学价值以及人物形象的生动和典型化，经过改编往往获得很大的成功。今年的《红楼梦》及过去拍摄的《祝福》、《林家铺子》、《骆驼祥子》等就是明显的例子。
    四、还有待发掘的极为丰富的中华民族几千年的历史题材。从《林则徐》到既有广泛影响又在国内颇有争议的《末代皇帝》（与国外合拍）。
    这些方面，恰恰是我国电影的艺术特色，也是我们取之不尽的丰富的创作源泉。所谓中国特色，我认为最重要的应该理解为：通过电影艺术的特性，以马克思主义、毛泽东思想为指导，反映中华民族的光荣历史，特别是中国共产党所领导的战斗历程和建国以来的斗争，走自己的道路，有自己独特的经验和教训；并且展现随着历史的进程在不断形成的一代一代具有新的民族精神和性格的新人，奋勇向前，永无止境；在艺术的创新中，把不断发掘电影艺术的表现潜力和吸收融化中国文化艺术自身独有的优秀传统紧密相联。唯有正确理解这个特色，电影艺术的群众性，才能得到正确的发扬，才能发挥它在建设社会主义精神文明中特殊的功能，为提高整个民族的思想道德、科学文化素质，培养一代社会主义新人作出更大贡献。
    我始终认为，愈是群众性、影响较广泛的艺术，愈应该提倡周恩来同志所讲的“寓教育于娱乐”。我们要向四化前进，却还有两三亿文盲、半文盲，如果人的素质不提高，那就是我们前进中最大的障碍。过去把教育仅仅归结为政治即阶级斗争为纲，失之于片面、简单化。然而，否认娱乐中的任何教育作用，其实也是一种偏见。思想、道德、情操、文化修养、审美能力、历史知识、人的行为准则，个人的爱好趣味，讲礼貌、尊重人、关心人……总之，文化艺术所起的一切陶冶性情的作用，凡是对青年一代身心健康发展有影响的，其实都含有教育的因素。而且，文艺更多的还是“情感教育”。
    轻视、忽视、完全否认文艺的教育意义和功能，其结果往往是为庸俗低级甚至色情的东西打开大门。建国四十周年之际，在全国范围内开展了一个历史上前所未有的“扫黄”，难道不应该引起我们深刻地反思么？
    前不久，我又重新读了1959年周总理关于《文艺工作两条腿走路》的讲话，我认为，这个讲话的基本精神和原理，结合今天的形势来看，仍然是一个很有现实意义的指导思想。因此，我认为电影艺术创作在贯彻党的十三届四中全会决议精神，坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，在建设社会主义精神文明中如何更加健康地发展和繁荣，确实是一个应该思考的根本问题。
    什么是我们中国电影的特色，我们怎么走出这条道路来，怎么去发展我们特有的经验和传统？如何在新时期更好地坚决贯彻“二为”方向和“双百”方针，不再老重复过去的错误，一强调“二为”方向，就忽视了“双百”方针，或一强调“双百”而又背离了“二为”的方向？真正掌握中央的方针政策，学会两条腿走路，是十分重要的。
