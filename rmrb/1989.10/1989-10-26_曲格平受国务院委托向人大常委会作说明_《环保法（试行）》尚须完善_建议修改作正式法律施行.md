The State Council Premier Li Peng submitted to the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress held today a proposal from the State Council requesting the review of the draft amendment to the "Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China."

The proposal states that since the "Environmental Protection Law (Trial)" was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress in 1979 for trial implementation, it has played a certain role in strengthening China's environmental protection work and reducing environmental pollution and destruction. However, it has been found in the course of implementation that the law is not perfect in some respects, and some of its contents are no longer in line with the current situation. The National Environmental Protection Bureau and other departments have conducted extensive investigations and discussions and repeatedly revised the draft amendment to the "Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China."

At today's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Qu Guoping, Director of the National Environmental Protection Bureau, was commissioned by the State Council to explain the draft amendment to the Environmental Protection Law.

Regarding the necessity of amending the trial Environmental Protection Law, Qu Guoping said that the trial Environmental Protection Law (hereinafter referred to as the "Trial Environmental Protection Law") has played a certain role in strengthening China's environmental protection work and reducing environmental pollution and destruction since it was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress in 1979. However, it has been found in the course of implementation that the "Trial Environmental Protection Law" is not perfect in some respects, and some of its contents are no longer in line with the current situation. First, the "Trial Environmental Protection Law" was formulated in accordance with Article 11 of the 1978 Constitution, which states that "the state protects the environment and natural resources and prevents pollution and other public hazards." The 1982 Constitution stipulates in Article 26 that "the state protects and improves the living environment and ecological environment and prevents pollution and other public hazards." Therefore, the legal basis for environmental protection has changed. Second, many effective systems in practice have not been confirmed. For example, it only stipulates that excess standard emissions should be subject to emission fees, but does not stipulate that for the emission of certain pollutants, even if they do not exceed the standard, emission fees should also be levied; it does not stipulate the permit system for the emission of pollutants; it does not set up a special chapter on legal liability, but only makes a general provision on punishment. Third, some contents are no longer in line with the current situation. For example, the "Trial Environmental Protection Law" specifically stipulates the establishment and functions of environmental protection agencies, which is not conducive to deepening institutional reform; in addition, for enterprises that exceed the standard for the emission of pollutants, it is stipulated that the production scale of the enterprise should be restricted if the national standard is not reached within the prescribed period, which is also not appropriate.

He said that the "Trial Environmental Protection Law" is a trial law and should be amended and improved on the basis of summarizing experience and implemented as a formal law.

Qu Guoping said that in the ten years since the implementation of the "Trial Environmental Protection Law," the environmental pollution and destruction in some regions have been controlled and treated to a certain extent, but from a national perspective, the problems of pollution and environmental destruction are still quite serious. During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, atmospheric pollution was severe, with the average values of dustfall and particulate matter exceeding the standard every year; the scope of urban surface water pollution has reached more than 80%, and the water quality of 50% of urban groundwater does not meet the drinking water standard. The main river systems all have severely polluted river sections, and eutrophication of lakes has not been effectively controlled; solid waste pollution is increasingly serious; noise pollution is still severe. In the natural environment, there are frequent incidents of indiscriminate logging, destruction of wildlife, and damage to scenic spots. In order to further strengthen supervision and management, the "Draft Amendment to the Environmental Protection Law" specially sets up a chapter on "Environmental Supervision and Management."

He said that the "Trial Environmental Protection Law" does not stipulate the permit system for the emission of pollutants. In many developed countries abroad, this system has been implemented and has played a good role in environmental protection. In recent years, some places in China have also tried this system and have gained some experience. Practice has proved that this system can play a good role. Therefore, the "Draft Amendment to the Environmental Protection Law" confirms this system.

　　曲格平受国务院委托向人大常委会作说明
　　《环保法（试行）》尚须完善
　　建议修改作正式法律施行
    新华社北京10月25日电　国务院总理李鹏向今天举行的七届全国人大常委会第十次会议提交了国务院关于提请审议《中华人民共和国环境保护法（修改草案）》的议案。
    议案说，《环境保护法（试行）》自1979年经第五届全国人民代表大会常务委员会公布试行以来，对加强我国环境保护工作，减少环境的污染和破坏起到了一定作用。但是，在执行中也发现该法有不够完善的地方，有些内容也已不适应当前形势发展的需要。国家环保局等部门经过广泛调查研究，反复讨论修改，拟订了中华人民共和国环境保护法修改草案。
    在今天的人大常委会上，国家环境保护局局长曲格平受国务院的委托，就环境保护法修改草案作了说明。
    关于修改环境保护法试行的必要性，曲格平说，环境保护法试行（以下简称《环保法（试行）》），自1979年经第五届全国人民代表大会常务委员会公布试行以来，对加强我国环境保护工作，减少环境的污染和破坏起到了一定作用。但是，在执行中也发现《环保法（试行）》有不够完善的地方，有些内容也已不适应当前形势发展的需要：一是《环保法（试行）》是依据1978年《宪法》第十一条“国家保护环境和自然资源，防治污染和其他公害”的规定制定的。1982年《宪法》第二十六条规定“国家保护和改善生活环境和生态环境，防治污染和其他公害”，因此，环境保护的立法依据发生了变化。二是对许多在实践中行之有效的制度没有加以确认。例如，只规定超标准排污要征收排污费，没有规定对排放某些污染物，虽然没有超标准排放，也应当征收排污费；没有规定排放污染物许可制度；没有设专章规定法律责任，只是对惩罚作了一条笼统的规定。三是有些内容已不适应当前形势发展的需要。例如，《环保法（试行）》具体地规定了环境保护机构的设置和职责，这样规定不利于深化机构改革；此外，对超标准排放污染物的企业限期治理，逾期达不到国家标准的，只规定要限制企业的生产规模，也不够妥当。
    他说，《环保法（试行）》是试行法，应当在总结经验的基础上，加以修改完善，作为正式法律施行。
    曲格平说，《环保法（试行）》实施十年来，一些地区的环境污染和环境破坏在一定程度上得到控制和治理，但就全国来看，污染和破坏环境的问题仍然相当严重。“六五”期间大气污染严重，降尘和降颗粒物的平均值每年都超标；城市地表水污染范围已达80％以上，50％的城市地下水的水质不符合饮用水标准，主要水系干流都有严重污染的河段，湖泊富营养化未能得到有效控制；固体废弃物污染环境不断加剧；噪声污染依然严重。在自然环境中，乱砍滥伐林木、破坏野生生物和风景名胜区的行为时有发生。为了进一步加强监督管理，《环保法（修改草案）》专门设立了“环境的监督管理”一章。
    他说，《环保法（试行）》中没有规定排放污染物许可证制度。在国外许多发达国家都实行了这一制度，对保护环境起了很好的作用。近年来我国的一些地方也试行了这一制度，并取得了一些经验。实践证明，这一制度能够发挥很好的作用。因此，在《环保法（修改草案）》中确认了这一制度。
