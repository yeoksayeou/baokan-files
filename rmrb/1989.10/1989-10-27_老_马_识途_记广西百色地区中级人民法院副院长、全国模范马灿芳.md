The first encounter was at the Beijing High People's Court. At that time, the President of the Supreme People's Court, Ren Jianxin, was awarding her the "National Court Model" medal. Seeing her gentle face with glasses perched on her nose, it was hard to believe she was a stern and upright judge who enforces the law strictly.

She is Ma Canfang, Deputy Director of the Intermediate People's Court of Baise Region, Guangxi. Her tumultuous life experiences are filled with a returned overseas Chinese's loyalty to the Party and the country.

In the autumn of 1959, Ma Canfang graduated from the Central-South Institute of Political Science and Law and boarded a southbound train to Napa County, Guangxi, where she worked at the Xiaohua Court. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, she served as the head of the Criminal Trial Division at the Napa County Court.

At the beginning of her tenure, a hooligan case was placed on her desk. The case was not complicated: three children of county leaders started a fight at the entrance of a movie theater, injuring someone. One of the children's father was the county party secretary, and his mother was the deputy director of the Labor and Personnel Bureau.

The deputy director of the Labor and Personnel Bureau cursed the investigators behind their backs, saying they were "making trouble" and threatened to go to Beijing to complain. Faced with pressure, Ma Canfang did not yield. She took on this difficult case voluntarily. A well-wisher warned her, "Be careful about your 'official hat." She replied bluntly, "What is personal gain and loss?" She conducted a thorough investigation and eventually sentenced the three defendants to imprisonment.

In March of this year, Ma Canfang handled a case of intentional homicide.

The defendant was a pig trader from Weicheng Township, Pingguo County, Baise Region. Not only did they fail to pay taxes as required, but they also premeditatedly planned to evade tax inspections. Tax collector Huang discovered this and sent six people to intercept them. The pig traders, facing the oncoming group, stepped on the accelerator, and the tractor roared past, killing one person on the spot. To understand the case, Ma Canfang worked day and night, finding the parties involved at the scene. In just 10 days, she concluded the case.

In April 1986, Ma Canfang was appointed Deputy Director of the Intermediate People's Court of Baise Region.

After working in the mountains for 30 years, she is still a deputy sectional-level cadre. Many of the university graduates who went with her in the 1950s have left the poor mountain valleys, and many of them have higher administrative ranks than she does. However, she has never asked the organization for better treatment.

When I asked her about her feelings participating in the National Labor Model and Advanced Individual Award Conference, she said meaningfully, "The honor given to me by the Party and the people is too high, and the burden on my shoulders is heavier."

　　老“马”识途
　　——记广西百色地区中级人民法院副院长、全国模范马灿芳
　　张明旺
    第一次见面，是在北京市高级人民法院。当时，最高人民法院院长任建新正给她颁发“全国法院模范”奖章。看着她那温和、鼻梁架一副眼镜的面容，怎么也不敢相信她竟是一位刚直不阿、执法如山的法官。
    她，就是广西百色地区中级人民法院副院长马灿芳。她那坎坷的生活经历，饱含一位归国华侨对党、对祖国的忠诚。
    1959年秋，马灿芳从中南政法学院毕业，登上南下的列车，来到广西那坡县下华法庭。党的十一届三中全会以后，她在那坡县法院，担任刑事审判庭庭长。
    上任伊始，一起流氓案摆在她的案头。案情并不复杂：三名县领导干部子弟在电影院门口寻衅滋事，殴打他人致伤。其中一名的父亲是县委书记，母亲是劳动人事局副局长。
    那位劳动人事局副局长暗地里骂办案人员“捣鬼”，要到北京告状。面对着压力，马灿芳没有屈服，她主动承办这个棘手的案件。好心人提醒她：“当心‘乌纱帽’。”她回答得干脆：“个人得失算得了什么？”她深入调查，最后依法判处3名被告有期徒刑。
    今年3月，马灿芳审理一起故意杀人案。
    案犯是百色地区萍果县韦成乡贩猪农民。他们不但不按章纳税，还事先预谋逃脱税收检查。税收员黄某发现此事后，派6人堵截。贩猪者面对来人，猛踩油门，拖拉机呼啸而过，当场撞死1人。为了解案情，马灿芳日夜奔忙，找到现场当事人，仅仅10天，她便结了此案。
    1986年4月，马灿芳被任命为百色地区中级人民法院副院长。
    在山区工作了30年的她，至今仍然是个副处级干部，五十年代和她一同分去的大学生，不少人都调离了穷山沟，其中不少人的行政级别都比她高，但是，她从来没有为待遇向组织伸过手。
    当我问她参加全国劳模和先进人物表彰大会有何感受时，她意味深长地说：“党和人民给予我的荣誉太高了，自己肩上的担子更重了。”
