People from inland areas know that Tibetan compatriots love to drink barley wine, but they may not know that barley wine on the tables of Lhasa residents has been replaced by beer.

A Tibetan friend told the reporter that in recent years, beer from inland areas has flooded the Lhasa market. Beer has a pure taste and is rich in nutrition, better than barley wine, and has gradually become a favorite among Tibetan people. It is reported that Lhasa is currently planning to build a brewery, and technical personnel from inland areas have been dispatched to provide support.

    拉萨藏胞餐桌上  啤酒取代青稞酒
    据新华社拉萨10月6日电　（记者秦卫东）内地人都知道藏族同胞爱喝青稞酒，殊不知，拉萨人餐桌上的青稞酒已被啤酒取代了。
    一位藏族朋友对记者说，近年来，内地的啤酒大量涌入拉萨市场。啤酒口味纯正，营养丰富，比青稞酒好，已经逐渐成为深受藏族群众喜爱的杯中物。据悉，目前拉萨正在筹建一座啤酒厂，内地已派技术人员予以支援。
