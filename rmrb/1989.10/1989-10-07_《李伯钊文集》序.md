The publication of the Collected Works of Li Bozhao makes me very happy. I would like to write a few words to express my remembrance and longing for Comrade Li Bozhao.

Comrade Ye Jianying once wrote and gave me a seven-character quatrain: "In Xi'an, capturing Jiang to reverse the perilous situation, in the war of resistance against Japan, poems were composed. The house remains, but half the people have passed away, standing in the wind and rain by the small window for a long time." Marshal Ye wrote this poem in 1979 when he revisited the old site of the Eighth Route Army Office in Xi'an. Ten years ago, he sighed, "half the people have passed away." Today, most of the people from that time are no longer with us. The images of these departed old comrades and old friends often appear in my mind, and among them is Comrade Li Bozhao.

Comrade Li Bozhao passed away on April 17, 1985. When she was critically ill, I happened to be not in Beijing. Upon hearing the news of her serious condition, my wife Wang Jiqing and I were both very worried. When we learned that her condition had improved, we were greatly relieved and planned to go to the hospital to see her as soon as we returned to Beijing, just like we used to, to chat with her and express our wishes and those of many other old comrades: hoping she would recover soon and write a few more good plays for us to watch. Unfortunately, when we rushed back to Beijing, Comrade Li Bozhao had already fallen asleep among the pine trees and flowers. At that time, our grief was indescribable.

Comrade Li Bozhao and I have been friends and comrades-in-arms for over half a century. In the winter of 1931, we met in the capital of the Soviet area, Ruijin. At that time, I, as a representative of the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet area, went to Ruijin to attend the First National Congress of the Chinese Soviet Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. During the congress, the representatives watched a performance by the cultural workers of the Central Soviet area. The content included songs and dances praising the bravery of the Red Army soldiers and mobilizing the masses to join the Red Army, as well as street plays depicting the Soviet area people seizing landlords' property and distributing land. These performances were fresh and lively, inspiring the audience, and the atmosphere on and off the stage was very lively, making me feel the important role of revolutionary art in the entire revolutionary struggle. It was an unforgettable performance.

After that performance, some comrades told me that these programs were directed and performed by Li Bozhao, a Soviet student and companion of Yang Shangkun. She also participated in several of the performances. Since the performers on stage were in makeup, I did not know who Li Bozhao was at the time. A few days later, a female editor from the Red China newspaper came to interview me. She was of short stature, enthusiastic, and spoke with a Sichuan accent, introducing herself, "I am Li Bozhao." It was then that I first met this famous cultural propagandist in the Central Soviet area.

During that conversation, I introduced to Comrade Li Bozhao the situation in the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet area under the military guidance of Mao Zedong, including the struggle against the enemy, land revolution, and mass work. Comrade Li Bozhao was quick-witted, asking questions and taking notes. She did not speak much, but every question she asked hit the key points. The deep impression she left on me at the time was that she was a talented and dedicated Red Army female soldier.

After that, I came to know more about Comrade Li Bozhao. In the Central Soviet area, she made outstanding contributions to the ideological and political work of the Red Army and to the development of the revolutionary base area's newspapers, drama, music, and dance. In particular, she combined the folk song form popular among the military and civilians in the Soviet area with the actual revolutionary struggle, creating many songs and dances. These songs and dances not only spread widely in the Central Soviet area but also some were later transmitted to our Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet area, playing a powerful role in inspiring and encouraging the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in their revolutionary struggle. What is even more admirable is that in those difficult years in the Central Soviet area, she, as a female comrade, was entrusted by the Party to establish the first art school of our Party—the Gorky Drama School. She served as the principal and trained a batch of revolutionary artists for our Party and army. During this period, she also created many literary works in the Central Soviet area. She was one of the pioneers of our Party and army's cultural propaganda work in the revolutionary base area and a famous dramatist and writer of the older generation of our Party.

Comrade Li Bozhao was a staunch Marxist, an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, and a seasoned communist warrior. She always had unwavering confidence in the revolutionary cause led by our Party. In the autumn of 1934, the arduous Long March began, and Comrade Li Bozhao was one of the 30 famous female Red Army soldiers who participated in the Long March of the Central Red Army. On the Long March, she propagated and mobilized the Red Army and the masses. The cadres and main performers of the propaganda teams of the Second Red Army all sought her advice. I came to know her more through this.

Our Second Red Army began the Long March from western Hunan. Around July 1936, when the Second Red Army reached western Sichuan, we encountered a cultural propaganda team led by Comrade Li Bozhao from the Fourth Red Army. After that, she participated in the meeting of the Second and Fourth Red Armies and crossed the grasslands with us to go north to resist Japan. For Comrade Li Bozhao, this was her third time crossing the grasslands. The first time was with the First Red Army, and then she was forced back by Zhang Guotao to cross the grasslands again. For a female comrade to cross the grasslands three times under such extremely difficult and harsh conditions, one can imagine the tremendous willpower and perseverance required.

I remember that during our Long March, whether on the misty and rugged mountain paths or in the vast grasslands, Comrade Li Bozhao often ignored her fatigue and sang revolutionary songs to boost everyone's morale. At that time, the Red Army's material life was extremely meager, and many comrades collapsed from injuries and exhaustion and never got up again. But Comrade Li Bozhao endured the cold, hunger, and exhaustion, often sharing her meager rations with others, and taught revolutionary songs and performed dances for the Red Army soldiers. Wherever she went, joy and morale were boosted. She was a respected and welcomed person in the Red Army. It was then, under her teaching, that I learned the song "Knocking Down the Cavalry," which I can still sing today.

During the Yan'an period, Comrade Li Bozhao participated in the leadership of the Lu Xun Art Academy and attended the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, listening to Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the forum. During this period, her creations increased, and every time we met, she enthusiastically shared some revolutionary cultural information with us, these old soldiers from the battlefield.

During the War of Liberation and the early years of the founding of the nation, Comrade Li Bozhao devoted more of her energy to the Party's leadership of cultural work. She loyally implemented the Party's cultural policies and became a confidante of many cultural workers inside and outside the Party. As the first director of the Beijing People's Art Theatre and one of the leaders of the Central Academy of Drama, she trained a large number of cultural cadres for New China, with her students scattered all over the country.

Comrade Li Bozhao was a politically acute and strong comrade. I remember in the spring of 1966, my wife and I met with Yang Shangkun and Li Bozhao in Guangzhou. That was a time when "the storm was about to come," and Comrade Yang Shangkun had already been criticized. During that conversation, we all expressed our dissatisfaction with the ultra-leftist appearance of Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and others, and we felt indignant about the criticism of Deng Tuo and others' "San Jia Village" and "Yanshan Night Talk." When talking about these things, Comrade Li Bozhao's attitude was clear, believing in the strength of the Party and the people, believing in the communist ideal, and having full confidence in the future. This was not only a comfort to us but also, I think, a great support to the broad-minded Yang Shangkun. At that time, looking at the resolute expression on the face of the 55-year-old Comrade Li Bozhao, I said to her, "Seeing you so strong, I have eight words to send you: Heroine, forever young."

During the "Cultural Revolution," we all suffered, and many old comrades and old friends were persecuted. Yang Shangkun and Li Bozhao were no exception, which made us extremely resentful towards the two counter-revolutionary cliques of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing.

When the "Gang of Four" was smashed, our excitement is imaginable. Although Comrade Li Bozhao's family returned to Beijing, for a period of time, Yang Shangkun and Li Bozhao did not receive rehabilitation and exoneration. Many old comrades were indignant, and I spoke out about this matter. During that time, we often went to see Comrade Li Bozhao. Seeing her dragging her body, which was disabled due to persecution, still practicing and writing, she said she wanted to live a few more years to participate in the new Long March and write a few more works to pass on the Party's fine traditions to future generations. Hearing her words, we, who wanted to comfort her, were instead comforted. Indeed, in her later years, she collaborated with other comrades to write excellent scripts like "Northward."

In her more than 60 years of revolutionary career, Comrade Li Bozhao was always a tireless singer for the Party and a passionate singer for the people. She loved the Party and the people so deeply.

Here, I would like to specially mention Comrade Li Bozhao's consistent self-reliant work and self-reliant struggle. Those who are familiar with her will feel that she is a Communist Party member who does not seek fame. In the more than 60 years of wind and rain, she has always been self-respecting, self-reliant, and self-reliant. Whether in the gunfire and shelling of the war years or in the peaceful environment after the founding of New China, she has always struggled hard for the Party and the people, doing practical work, and winning the trust of the Party and the respect of the people. She is indeed a brave Chinese woman and a Long March hero in the literary and artistic circles.

The publication of the Collected Works of Li Bozhao is a great comfort to those who often miss Comrade Li Bozhao and is also a spiritual treasure left to future generations. The articles and works included in the book basically reflect Comrade Li Bozhao's revolutionary achievements and hard work throughout her life. This collection will definitely inspire us survivors and future generations.

    《李伯钊文集》序
    王震
    《李伯钊文集》编辑出版，我很高兴，想为这本书写几句话，以表达对伯钊同志的缅怀和思念。
    叶剑英同志曾书赠我一首七言绝句：“西安捉蒋翻危局，内战吟成抗日诗。楼屋依旧人半逝，小窗风雨立多时。”叶帅这首诗是1979年在西安八路军办事处旧地重游时作的。十年前，他感叹“人半逝”，今天，当年之人可说已经多数不在了。这些逝去的老同志、老战友的音容笑貌，常常在我脑海里浮现，其中就有伯钊同志。
    伯钊同志是1985年4月17日逝世的。在她病情危重的时候，我正巧不在北京。听到她病重的消息，我和我的老伴王季青都十分忧念，得悉她病情好转，我们甚感宽慰，打算一回到北京，就赶到医院看她，像以往那样，在一起谈心，并向她表达我们和其他许多老同志的心愿：希望她早日恢复健康，再给大家写几台好戏看。谁知，当我们赶回北京时，伯钊同志已经长眠在松柏和鲜花丛中，那时，我们的悲痛心情是难以言表的。
    伯钊同志和我，是半个多世纪的老朋友、老战友。1931年冬，我们相识于红都瑞金。那时，我作为湘赣苏区的代表，到瑞金出席中华苏维埃工农兵第一次全国代表大会。大会期间，代表们观看了中央苏区文艺工作者的演出，内容有赞扬红军战士勇敢作战和动员人民群众参加红军的歌舞，有表现苏区人民打土豪、分田地的活报剧等。这些节目清新活泼，激奋人心，台上台下，气氛十分热烈，更使我感到革命文艺在整个革命斗争中的重要作用。这是一次令人难忘的演出。
    那次演出之后，有的同志告诉我，这些节目是杨尚昆同志的伴侣、留苏学生李伯钊主持编导的，她还亲自参加了几个剧目的演出。由于演出时舞台上的人是化了妆的，究竟哪一位是李伯钊，当时我并不知道。没过几天，全国苏维埃机关报《红色中华》来了一位女编辑，她个头不高，热情活泼，操着四川口音自我介绍说：“我叫李伯钊，来采访你。”这时，我才第一次认识了这位在中央苏区颇有名气的文艺宣传工作者。
    在那次交谈中，我向伯钊同志介绍了湘赣苏区在毛泽东的军事思想指导下开展对敌斗争、土地革命、群众工作等方面的情况。伯钊同志思路敏捷，边问边记。她的插话不多，但每个问题都抓住了关键。当时给我留下的深刻印象是：她多才多艺，是一位对革命事业无限忠诚的红军女战士。
    此后，我较多地了解了伯钊同志。在中央苏区，她对于红军的思想政治工作，对发展革命根据地的报刊宣传、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈等，都做出了出色贡献。特别是她把苏区军民喜闻乐见的山歌形式与现实的革命斗争内容相结合，创作了许多歌舞。这些歌舞不但在中央苏区广为流传，而且有些还先后传到我们湘赣苏区，对广大军民的革命斗争，起到了有力的鼓舞、激励作用。更加难能可贵的是，在中央苏区那艰难岁月里，她作为一位女同志，受党的委派，创办了我们党的第一所文艺学校——高尔基戏剧学校，她担任校长，为我党我军培养了一批革命的文艺家。这期间，她在中央苏区还创作了许多文艺作品。她是革命根据地我党我军文艺宣传工作的开拓者之一，是我们党的老一代著名的戏剧教育家、作家。
    伯钊同志是一位坚定的马克思主义者、杰出的无产阶级革命家、久经考验的共产主义战士，她始终对我们党领导的革命事业，充满着必胜的信心。1934年秋，开始了艰苦卓绝的长征，伯钊是参加中央红军长征的30位著名红军女战士之一。长征路上，向红军宣传鼓动，向广大人民宣传鼓动，红二方面军的各个宣传队干部、主要演员都向伯钊同志请教。我更多地了解了她。
    我们红二方面军是从湘西开始长征的。大约在1936年的7月间，当红二方面军走到川西时，遇到了伯钊率领的一个红四方面军的文艺宣传队，之后，她参加了红二、四方面军的会师，随同我们过草地，北上抗日。对伯钊来说，这次是第三次过草地了。她第一次是随一方面军即中央红军过的草地，后被张国焘裹胁返回来二过草地。对一位女同志来说，在那样极端艰难困苦的情况下三过草地，需要多么坚强的意志和毅力，是可想而知的。
    记得我们一道长征时，无论在云雾缭绕的崎岖山道上，还是在茫茫草地的宿营处，伯钊同志经常不顾疲劳，唱革命歌曲，增强大家克服困难的信心。那时，红军的物质生活极度匮乏，许多同志因伤病、劳累倒下去再也起不来了，但伯钊忍受着冻饿劳累，常常拿出自己的一点给养帮助别人，还为红军指战员教唱革命歌曲，表演舞蹈，她走到哪里，哪里就增添欢乐，就士气振奋。她在红军中是一位受尊重、受欢迎的人。就是在那时，在她的教唱下，我学会了《打骑兵歌》，这支歌，我至今还会唱。
    延安时期，伯钊同志参加了鲁迅艺术学院的领导工作，出席了延安文艺座谈会，听了毛泽东同志在座谈会上的讲话。这个时期，她的创作就更多了，每次见面，她都热情地向我们这些沙场老兵沟通些革命的文艺信息。
    解放战争和建国初期，伯钊以更多的精力，参与了党对文艺工作的领导。她忠诚地执行党的文艺政策，成为党内外许多文艺工作者的贴心人。作为北京人民艺术剧院第一任院长、中央戏剧学院领导人之一，她为新中国培养了大批文艺骨干，桃李满天下。
    伯钊是一位政治上很敏锐、很坚强的同志。记得在1966年春天，我和老伴同尚昆、伯钊夫妇会于羊城。那是个“山雨欲来”的时刻，尚昆同志已遭非难。在那次交谈中，我们一起对张春桥、姚文元等人极“左”面貌表示不满，为批判邓拓等同志的“三家村”、《燕山夜话》鸣不平。谈到这些事情，伯钊态度鲜明，坚信党和人民的力量，坚信共产主义理想，对前途充满信心。这不仅对我们是个安慰，我想，对豁达大度的尚昆，也是很大的支持。当时，我看着年已55岁的伯钊脸上那刚毅的神态，对她说：“看到你这样坚强，我想了8个字送你：巾帼英雄，老当益壮。”
    “文化大革命”中，我们这些人都遭了难，许多老同志、老战友都受到摧残，尚昆、伯钊夫妇自不待言，这使我们对林彪、江青两个反革命集团无比愤恨。
    “四人帮”被粉碎，我们的兴奋心情是可想而知的。伯钊一家虽然回到了北京，但是有一段时间，尚昆、伯钊夫妇未得到平反昭雪，许多老同志愤愤不平，我为此事是放了“炮”的。在那段时间里，我们经常去看伯钊，见她拖着被迫害致残的身体，仍在练功、写字，她说要争取多活几年，参加新的长征，还要再写几部作品，把党的优良传统留给后人。听了她这些话，我们这些想宽慰她的人，反而得到了宽慰。果然，在她的晚年，她又同其他同志合作，写出了像《北上》这样好的剧本。
    在60多年的革命生涯中，伯钊对党，始终是一位不倦的歌者；对人民，始终是一位热情的歌者。她对党、对人民，爱得是那样深。
    这里，我要特别说一说伯钊一贯自力工作、自力奋斗的品格。凡熟悉她的人，都会感到，她是一位不图虚名的共产党员。在60多年的风风雨雨中，她始终自尊、自强、自力。无论在战争年代的枪林弹雨中，还是在新中国成立后的和平环境里，她都自力拚搏，为党为人民踏踏实实地做事，赢得了党的信任和人民的尊敬。她不愧为奋勇搏斗的中华女性，不愧是文学艺术界的长征英雄。
    伯钊文集的编辑出版，对时常怀念伯钊的同志是一个很好的安慰，也是留给后人的一笔精神财富。收入书中的文章和作品，基本上反映了伯钊同志一生的革命业绩和耕耘心血。这本文集，一定会激励我们这些幸存者和后来人。
