Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 7th.

North Korea's government, political parties, and mass organizations held a joint meeting on September 28 to promote the independent and peaceful reunification of the motherland. They also sent a letter to the South Korean authorities and various political parties and mass organizations, proposing the convening of a national unification consultative conference. This conference would bring together representatives from the authorities and various parties and strata from both the North and the South to determine a common path to unification.

The letter stated that the national unification consultative conference should include representatives from the authorities and major political parties and mass organizations from both the North and the South, with an equal number of representatives from each side, totaling 60 people. Individuals from various circles within and outside the country can also participate in the conference. At the conference, representatives can extensively discuss unification plans proposed by the authorities and parties from both the North and the South, and issue a joint declaration on the path to national unification. Additionally, other constructive proposals that promote national peaceful unification can be discussed simultaneously.

Regarding the format and date of the conference, the letter stated that the conference should be held alternately in Pyongyang and Seoul. The first conference should be held in Pyongyang on February 20, 1990, in a multilateral roundtable format.

The letter also mentioned that within the scope of the consultative conference, the highest authorities from both the North and the South can meet at any time to discuss various issues related to national unification and North-South relations.

The letter further proposed that the period from November this year to January next year be designated as the preparatory conference period. During this time, the authorities and parties from both the North and the South can engage in bilateral or multilateral contacts to advance the preparations for the conference.

The letter emphasized that political figures should abandon the mentality of subduing the other side and free themselves from the hostile sentiment of confrontation and competition. They should discard the prejudice of denying everything from the other side. For our part, although we believe that the proposal to establish the Democratic Confederation of Koryo is realistic and reasonable, we are willing to stand on a position of mutual reconciliation, respect, and compromise. We will sincerely discuss and consider other unification plans with an open mind.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 7th. According to a report by our reporter Xu Baokang, on October 3rd, North Korea broadcasted and sent a letter to the South Korean authorities and various political parties and mass organizations via international mail. Prior to this, two North Korean liaison officers had taken the letter to Panmunjom to hand it over to the South, but the South refused to accept it.

    朝鲜北方各界举行联席会议并致函南方
    建议召开民族统一协商会议
    本报讯　据朝鲜《劳动新闻》报道，朝鲜政府、政党、群众团体为促进祖国的自主和平统一，于9月28日举行联席会议，并通过一封致南朝鲜当局和各政党、群众团体的信，建议召开民族统一协商会议，由北方和南方的当局及各党派、各阶层人士聚集一堂，来确定共同的统一途径。
    信中说，民族统一协商会议由北方和南方的当局和主要政党、群众团体的代表参加，北方和南方人数相等，总人数以60名为宜。海内外各界的个别人士也可以参加会议。在民族统一协商会议上，可以广泛协商北方和南方当局及政党、群众团体提出的祖国统一方案，讨论发表有关祖国统一途径的民族共同宣言。此外，也可以同时讨论有助于促进国家和平统一的其他建设性提案。
    关于会议的形式和日期，信中说，会议在平壤和汉城轮流召开，第一次会议于1990年2月20日在平壤举行，采取多边的圆桌会议方式。
    信中说，在协商会议范围内，北方和南方的最高当局可以随时会晤，讨论有关国家的统一和北南关系的各种问题。
    信中还希望把今年11月至明年1月定为预备会议期，在这段时间里，北方和南方当局及政党、群众团体通过双边或多边接触，以推进会议的准备工作。
    这封信还特别指出，政治人士应该抛弃压服对方的心理，从同对方对峙、竞争的敌对感中摆脱出来，一扫一味否定对方的东西的偏见。就我们而言，尽管我们认为我们已经提出的建立高丽民主联邦共和国的方案是现实的、合理的，但是有意于站在互相和解、尊重、让步的立场上，对其他统一方案，虚心对待，真诚协商。
    本报平壤电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜3日通过广播和国际邮路播发出致南朝鲜当局及各政党、群众团体的信。在这之前，两名北方联络员曾持信前往板门店，准备交给南方，但南方拒绝接收。
