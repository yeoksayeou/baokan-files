Li Peng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, recently emphasized during an inspection of industrial and mining enterprises in Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi that the current nationwide rectification and austerity drive should shift from relying on investment to increase output and revenue to relying on improving efficiency to achieve the same goals.

Accompanying Li Peng on the inspection were Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor, and Zhou Jiahuai, State Councilor.

On October 8, a Sunday, Li Peng began his inspection of Baotou and other areas. That morning, after bidding farewell to Kaysone Phomvihane, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, who was visiting Beijing, Li Peng embarked on his journey to the northwest. Over the next two days, Li Peng visited local economic work sites during the day and held discussions with local party and government leaders in the evenings.

Since 1953, when the central government designated Baotou as a steel base, the city has developed from a fur trading hub into a new industrial city with a population of 1.69 million, focusing on metallurgy, machinery, and rare earth industries. During his stay in Baotou, Li Peng inspected key enterprises that have played a crucial role in the city's development: the First and Second Machinery Manufacturing Plants of Inner Mongolia, the Baotou Steel and Rare Earth Company, and visited the vehicle production line, steel smelting furnace, and rare earth products. He also greeted and conversed with workers on the job.

In a discussion with party and government leaders of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Baotou City, as well as Baotou Steel officials, Li Peng said, "Baotou has a solid foundation and good urban planning. Especially, Baotou has become one of the nine major steel production bases in the country, with significant developments in energy, raw materials, and transportation. The situation is promising, and I thank all the cadres and workers for their efforts. At the same time, we must also see the gaps and continue to strive to develop the steel industry and other sectors."

Li Peng pointed out that the emergence of a buyer's market for certain products is a necessary result of the rectification and austerity drive and a good opportunity to improve enterprise quality. It forces enterprises to improve product quality and increase variety. Leaders at all levels, especially enterprise leaders, must seize this opportunity to focus on improving enterprise economic efficiency, reducing material consumption, using existing equipment and production capacity for technological upgrades, introducing technology, strengthening management, changing product structures, and exploring enterprise potential in every possible way.

When discussing the enterprise contract responsibility system, Li Peng reiterated that the contract policy remains unchanged. However, he also pointed out that unchanged does not mean stagnating at the current level; it needs to be continuously improved. For example, our enterprises currently have a common issue: as production increases, output and profits rise, but self-owned liquid funds do not increase proportionally, and enterprises still need to borrow from banks. Therefore, the specific content of the contract should be continuously improved with the development of production.

Regarding the relationship between implementing the factory director responsibility system and the role of the enterprise party organization as the political core, Li Peng said that overemphasizing either aspect is not appropriate. If the factory director cannot effectively command production, it will be difficult to achieve good economic results. Conversely, if the factory director has absolute authority without supervision, that is also not acceptable. We are a socialist country and a developing country, and we cannot yet fully meet the people's growing material needs. This requires long-term, arduous efforts from the entire nation. Who will do this work? Only the party organizations at all levels can. In enterprises, the factory director and the party secretary have different responsibilities. The factory director is in charge of management, while the party secretary focuses on ideological and political work. They should cooperate and support each other.

Li Peng is particularly concerned about the energy base construction in the western region. On October 9, Li Peng left Baotou and headed to the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield, which spans Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, to inspect the construction and cut the ribbon for the coal transportation dedicated line—Baogod Railway—organized by Huadian Coal Company.

The Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield is currently the largest coalfield in China, with proven reserves of 200 billion tons. The current construction scale has reached 80 million tons. At the Daluta Railway Station, Li Peng inscribed the words: "Building roads in the coal sea, supporting the nation" and "Developing the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield to provide high-quality coal for the nation."

The Baogod Railway starts from Wanshuiquan in Baotou City and ends at Daluta in Shenmu County, Shaanxi Province, with a total length of 172 kilometers. The construction of this railway has opened an important channel from western Inner Mongolia to northern Shaanxi, creating favorable conditions for developing the rich coal resources in the Shenfu-Dongsheng region and building a new energy base in China. It also has significant implications for supporting the agricultural and industrial production of the old, minority, and border areas along the route, promoting economic development, and cultural progress. At the opening ceremony, Li Peng, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, congratulated the opening of the Baogod Railway. He hoped that the builders of the mine area would work together to build a modern, high-efficiency coal production base. Subsequently, Li Peng inspected the coal mine's production situation and visited some miners' families, chatting with them and inquiring about their work and living conditions. He expressed his warm regards to the miners and their families. When discussing the development plan for the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield, Li Peng told Wangqun, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, Buhe, Chairman of the Autonomous Region Government, Zhang Boqing, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, and Hou Zongbin, Governor of the Province, that the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield has abundant reserves and high-quality coal, which is rare not only in China but also in the world, with great development potential. To achieve rapid development in the mine area, the main principles should be: first, using coal to support coal development; second, utilizing some foreign capital; third, changing the old practice of recruiting a large number of permanent workers and implementing a rotating worker system. It is necessary to establish a coal construction and production management system that is full of vitality, combining local actual conditions, and explore a new path.

Accompanying Li Peng on this inspection were Huang Yicheng, Minister of the Energy Department, Li Senmao, Minister of the Railway Department, Gan Ziyu, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, He Guanghui, Deputy Director of the State Economic Reform Commission, and Yu Hong'en, General Manager of the China Coal Industry Bureau.

    李鹏在包头等地工矿企业视察时强调
    靠提高效益增加产值和财政
    对包头市和神府东胜煤田建设提出重要意见
    新华社呼和浩特10月10日电　（记者何东君、何平）中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏日前在对内蒙古、陕西两省区的一些工矿企业进行视察期间强调指出，当前全国上下都在进行治理整顿，我们发展经济应该从依靠投资增加产值和财政转到依靠提高效益增加产值和财政上来。
    和李鹏总理一起视察的领导同志还有：中共中央政治局委员、国务委员李铁映，国务委员邹家华。
    10月8日是星期天。李鹏总理利用休息日开始了他对包头等地的视察。这一天上午，李鹏总理同正在北京访问的老挝部长会议主席、人民革命党总书记凯山·丰威汉话别之后，即踏上了西北之行的旅程。两天时间里，李鹏总理白天马不停蹄地视察当地的经济工作，晚上利用休息时间同当地党政领导座谈。
    自从1953年中央确定包头为我国钢铁基地开始，经过36年的建设和发展，昔日的皮毛集散地，已发展成为一个拥有169万人口，以冶金、机械、稀土工业为主的重型结构的新兴工业城市。在包头期间，李鹏总理视察了在包头市的发展中起了重要作用的大型骨干企业：内蒙古第一机械制造厂、第二机械制造厂，包头钢铁稀土公司，参观了车辆生产线、炼钢高炉和稀土产品，并同正在劳动的工人热情握手，亲切交谈。
    在同内蒙古自治区和包头市的党政领导以及包钢负责人座谈时，李鹏说，包头市的基础很好，城市规划得也不错。特别是包头已成为全国九大钢铁生产基地之一，能源、原材料、交通等方面也有较大发展，形势是喜人的，感谢广大干部、职工的努力。同时也要看到差距，还需要继续奋斗，把钢铁工业和其它各业搞上去。
    李鹏指出，当前，某些产品买方市场的出现，是治理整顿的必然结果，也是提高企业素质的好时机，因为它迫使企业必须提高产品的质量，增加花色品种。各级领导特别是企业的领导，一定要利用这一有利时机，把工作的重点放在提高企业经济效益，降低原材料消耗上，利用现有的设备和生产能力进行技术改造，引进技术，加强管理，改变产品结构，千方百计挖掘企业的潜力。
    在谈到企业承包经营责任制问题时，李鹏重申：承包政策不变。但他同时指出，不变不等于停留在现有水平上，还需要不断加以完善。比如我们的企业现在都有一个通病，就是随着企业生产的发展，产值上去了，利润也多了，但是，自有流动资金却没有相应地增长，企业还要向银行贷款。所以，承包的具体内容也要随着生产的发展不断完善。
    关于实行厂长负责制同发挥企业党组织的政治核心作用的关系问题，李鹏说，过分强调哪一方面都不行。如果厂长不能有效地指挥生产，那就难以取得好的经济效益。反过来，厂长一切说了算，没有监督也是不行的。我们是社会主义国家，同时也是发展中国家，目前还不能充分满足人民日益增长的物质生活需要，这就需要全国人民长期地艰苦奋斗。谁来做这个工作？只有依靠各级党组织来做。在企业中，厂长和书记只是分工不同。厂长负责经营管理，书记抓思想政治工作，应该互相配合，互相支持。
    李鹏总理十分关心西北地区的能源基地建设。10月9日，李鹏总理离开包头市前往跨越内蒙古、陕西两省区的神府煤田视察，并为华能精煤公司组织修建的运煤专线——包神铁路通车典礼剪彩。
    神府、东胜煤田是我国目前储量最大的煤田，已探明储量2000亿吨，现在的建设规模，已达800万吨。在大柳塔车站，李鹏总理分别为通车和煤矿题词：“煤海筑路，支援全国。”“开发神府、东胜煤田，为全国多供优质煤。”
    包神铁路北起包头市的万水泉，南至陕西神木县大柳塔，正线全长172公里。这条铁路的修建，开辟了一条由内蒙古西部到陕北的重要通道，为开发神府、东胜地区蕴藏的丰富煤炭资源、建成我国新的能源基地创造了有利条件，同时对扶持沿线老、少、边地区工农业生产、繁荣经济、发展文化具有重要意义。在通车典礼上，李鹏总理代表党中央、国务院对包神铁路通车表示祝贺。他希望矿区的广大建设者们共同努力，把这里建设成为现代化的、高效益的煤炭生产基地。随后，李鹏总理察看了煤矿的生产情况，并走访了一些矿工家庭，和他们一起亲切攀谈，详细询问他们的工作和生活情况，对矿工及其家属表示亲切慰问。在谈到神府、东胜煤田的发展规划时，李鹏总理对内蒙古自治区党委书记王群、自治区政府主席布赫和陕西省委书记张勃兴、省长侯宗宾说，神府、东胜煤田储量丰富，煤质优良，这不仅在我国少有、在世界上也是少有的，发展潜力很大。要使矿区尽快取得较大发展，主要方针应该是：第一，以煤养煤；第二，利用一部分外资；第三，改变过去招收大量固定工的老路子，实行轮换工制。要结合当地的实际情况，建立起一套富有生机的煤炭建设和生产管理体系，走出一条新路子。
    随同李鹏总理进行这次视察的还有：能源部部长黄毅诚、铁道部部长李森茂、国家计委副主任甘子玉、国家体改委副主任贺光辉、中国统配煤矿总公司总经理于洪恩等。
