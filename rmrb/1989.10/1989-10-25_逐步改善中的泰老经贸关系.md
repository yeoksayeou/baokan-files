On October 6, Thailand announced the lifting of the ban on the export of the last 29 strategic items to Laos. With this, Thailand has fully lifted the ban on the export of 278 strategic items to Laos since 1981.

Since the peaceful resolution of the border conflict between Thailand and Laos at the beginning of last year and the visit of Thai Prime Minister Chatichai to Laos at the end of the year, the relationship between the two countries has gradually improved, particularly in promoting mutual trade and economic cooperation. Since last year, the Thai side has gradually reduced the restrictions on the export of strategic items to Laos. To promote trade exchanges, from January to March this year, the two sides opened three new trade routes along the border, increasing the number of border trade routes from the previous two to five. Trade between the two countries has been very active. According to data provided by the Thai Ministry of Commerce, the total value of direct trade between Thailand and Laos last year reached 1.6 billion baht, an increase of 640 million baht over 1987. From January to April this year, the total value of direct trade between the two countries reached 550 million baht. Officials from the Ministry of Commerce predict that the total trade volume between Thailand and Laos this year will exceed that of last year. He told the reporter that the above trade volume between the two countries does not include the transit trade volume of third-country goods. In the direct trade between the two countries, Thailand exports more and imports less. Thailand's main exports to Laos include bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, cars, building materials, televisions, VCRs, and other household appliances, machinery, medicines, fabrics, and various consumer goods. Laos' main exports to Thailand are timber, metal materials, and leather.

Currently, Thailand and Laos have developed from trade exchanges to trade cooperation. The reporter recently visited Vientiane and saw that many shops in the city are jointly operated with the Thai side. Shops directly import goods from Thailand, greatly boosting the market. Taking the First State Department Store in Vientiane as an example, when the reporter visited Vientiane in February last year, the store had insufficient goods and monotonous product varieties, with few customers. This contrasted sharply with the bustling individual stalls around the store. This time, the reporter revisited the store and was surprised by the changes. The store's area has expanded several times compared to before, and the variety of products is dazzling. The staff are enthusiastically introducing and selling products. A staff member told the reporter, "With the deepening of the country's reform and opening up, the store has joint operations with Thailand, so the supply is sufficient. At the same time, we have also reformed the management and service system. The store gives us a 2% commission on top of our original salary every month. This way, everyone's service quality naturally improves."

While expanding trade exchanges, Thailand and Laos have also promoted economic cooperation. Recently, Thai Deputy Supreme Commander Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and Lao People's Army Chief of Staff Sisavath Keobounphanh signed a bilateral cooperation agreement in Vientiane. The cooperation includes nine areas: agriculture, tourism, communications, transportation, and technology. In early October, the first joint bank between Thailand and Laos, the United Development Bank, was officially established in Vientiane, opening up a new situation for economic cooperation between the two countries. Currently, Thai investment in Laos is gradually increasing. The scope includes clothing, poultry farming, pig farming, feed processing, and logging. The reporter visited a joint venture clothing factory between Thailand and Laos. The Thai side mainly provides capital and technology, while the Lao side provides manpower. The Thai side brings fabric and samples to the factory to make clothes, which are then shipped back to Thailand and exported to European and American countries. The workers in the factory said that there are many such joint venture clothing factories in Vientiane.

Diplomats stationed in Vientiane believe that the potential for economic and trade cooperation between Thailand and Laos is enormous. The objective conditions are that the two countries are neighbors, transportation is convenient, languages are similar, and customs are similar, with Thailand and Laos referring to each other as brothers. Subjectively, both sides have the desire to strengthen cooperation. From the Thai side, its industry is developing rapidly, the economy is growing fast, and it needs to expand the market and obtain cheap raw materials and labor. For Laos, it is currently carrying out economic reforms and opening up, needing foreign capital, advanced technology, and machinery to accelerate resource development and promote domestic economic prosperity. If there are no other obstacles, it is believed that the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries will progress rapidly.

Zimbabwe's livestock industry is very developed, with 6.6 million cattle, 2.4 million sheep, and 220,000 pigs nationwide. The picture shows a farm on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.

　　逐步改善中的泰老经贸关系
　　本报记者　刘爱成
    10月6日，泰国宣布取消对老挝最后保留的29种战略物资出口的禁令。从此，泰国自1981年以来禁止对老挝出口的278种战略物资已告全部解禁。
    自去年初泰老两国边境冲突和平解决和年底泰国总理差猜访老后，泰老两国关系得到了逐步的恢复和改善，尤其表现在促进相互贸易和经济合作方面。去年以来，泰方开始逐步减少对老挝战略物资出口种类的限制。为了促进贸易交流，今年1月至3月，双方先后在两国边境上开放了3个新的贸易通道，使边境贸易通道从过去的2个增加到5个。两国间的贸易异常活跃。据泰国商业部提供的资料，去年泰老两国直接贸易价值总额达到16亿铢，比1987年增长了6.4亿铢。今年1—4月，两国直接贸易价值总额又达5.5亿铢。商业部官员预计今年泰老贸易总额将超过去年。他告诉记者，上述两国贸易额不包括第三国商品过境贸易额。在两国直接贸易中，泰方出多进少。泰国向老挝出口的商品主要有：自行车、摩托车、卡车、小汽车、建筑材料、电视机、录像机等家用电器、机械、医药、布匹以及各种生活消费品。老方向泰国出口的主要是木材、金属材料和皮革等。
    目前泰老两国已从贸易交往发展到了贸易合作，记者最近在万象采访时看到市区许多商店都与泰国方面合资经营。商店直接从泰国进货，大大繁荣了市场。以万象第一国营百货公司为例，记者去年2月访问万象时，该商店货源不足，商品种类单调，顾客很少。与该商店周围轰轰烈烈的个体商摊形成了明显的对照。这次记者重访该店，变化令人吃惊。商店不仅面积比过去扩大了好几倍，而且商品种类花样之多叫人目不暇接。服务员热情地忙着介绍推销商品，一位服务员告诉我，“随着国家改革开放的深入，该商店与泰国合资经营，所以货源充足。同时，我们还对经营管理和服务制度进行了改革。店里每月按原工资发给我们的同时，实行多售多得，给予2％的提成。这样一来，大家的服务质量自然就提高了。”
    泰老两国在扩大贸易交流的同时，还促进了经济合作。最近，泰国武装部队代理最高司令差瓦立和老挝人民军总参谋长西沙瓦在万象签署了一项双边合作协议。其合作内容包括农业、旅游、通讯、交通、科技等9个方面。10月初，泰老第一家合资银行——联合发展银行在万象正式成立，为两国经济合作打开了新的局面。目前泰国在老挝的投资逐渐增多。其范围包括成衣、养鸡、养猪、饲料加工及伐木等。记者访问了一家泰老合资经营的成衣厂。泰方主要出资金、技术，老方出人力。泰方把布匹和样品拿到厂里做成衣服，然后运回泰国，再出口到欧、美国家。该厂工人说，这类泰老合资的成衣厂在万象已有很多家。
    驻万象的外交人士认为，泰老两国经济贸易合作的潜力很大。其客观条件是两国为邻，运输方便，语言相通，风俗习惯相似，泰老以兄弟相称。在主观上，双方都有加强合作的愿望。从泰方来说，目前它的工业正在迅猛发展，经济增长快，需要扩大市场和廉价原料、劳力。对于老挝来说，目前正在进行经济改革、开放，需要外国资本、先进技术及机械设备以加快资源开发，促进国内经济繁荣。如果不会遇到别的障碍，相信这两国的经济贸易合作必然会进展很快。（附图片）
