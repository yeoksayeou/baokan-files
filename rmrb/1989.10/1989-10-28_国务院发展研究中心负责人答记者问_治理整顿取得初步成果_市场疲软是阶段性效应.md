Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th. Recently, an official from the State Council Development Research Center answered questions from Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the current economic situation in China, providing some reference materials and viewpoints for people to observe the economic situation.

How to view the current economic situation?

Q: Please share your views on the current economic situation.

A: The economic situation is developing as we anticipated. The rectification and adjustment work has achieved initial results. The excessively high industrial growth rate has significantly slowed down, fixed asset investment has been controlled, the upward trend in prices has eased, and the situation of money circulation has improved. People's expectations of price increases have gradually subsided. All these indicate that the policy of rectification and adjustment, and deepening reform decided by the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee is correct.

Q: Everyone is very concerned about the market situation. Let's start with the market.

A: In the past few years, the supply in our market has been quite tight, but this year there have been new changes: high-end consumer goods have shifted from "hot" to "cold"; essential goods have shifted from "booming" to "stable"; general daily consumer goods have shifted from "popular" to "stagnant." The total retail sales of social commodities from January to September amounted to 607.3 billion yuan, which is nominally 12.3% higher than the same period last year, but after deducting the price increase factor, it actually decreased by 8.2%. If there are no special circumstances, the market sales in the fourth quarter are not expected to improve significantly, and the actual sales of commodities for the whole year will be negative growth. This situation has only occurred in 1961, 1962, and 1968.

The market for production materials has also eased. In the first half of the year, the total purchase of production materials by material supply and marketing enterprises nationwide was 157 billion yuan, and the sales were 168.1 billion yuan. After excluding the price factor, they decreased by 14.9% and 22.8% respectively compared to the same period last year.

Q: What are the reasons for the market weakness?

A: The first and main reason is the initial effect of the first phase of rectification and adjustment.

A series of tightening measures have started to take effect in controlling demand. The state has initially controlled the scale of bank loans and currency issuance. There have been some achievements in compressing fixed asset investments. The investment reduced by the project cleanup is approximately 27 billion yuan in consumer demand. From January to September, the total investment completed by state-owned units was 126.1 billion yuan, a decrease of 7.2% compared to the same period last year. If the price factor is considered, the actual compression is more than 20%. The purchasing power of social groups has been initially controlled. From January to September, social groups purchased 52.1 billion yuan worth of consumer goods, an increase of only 6.2% compared to the same period last year. If the price factor is excluded, the actual decrease is significant.

While compressing demand, we have also paid special attention to increasing effective supply. The industrial growth rate for the first nine months of this year was 8.9%, and the market-hot products all had growth. The summer grain and early rice combined increased production by 351 million tons compared to last year. Compared to previous years, this year's supply increase is not very large, but the compression of demand itself has correspondingly increased the supply.

People's consumption tendency has weakened, and their savings tendency has strengthened. Especially, the attractiveness of value-preserving savings is very strong. In the first nine months of this year, savings deposits increased by 100 billion yuan, more than double the same period last year, reaching a 40-year high. About 80% of this is value-preserving savings.

The upward trend in prices this year has eased, and the monthly year-on-year index shows a downward trend. Consumers' "price increase" feeling is not strong, and inflation expectations have weakened, gradually restoring normal consumption psychology. People have learned from several rounds of panic buying, shifting from blind panic buying to rational selection. Moreover, prices rose continuously last year, and this year prices are expected to fall, causing consumers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude.

Demand has decreased, supply has increased, and especially due to the significant change in consumers' purchasing behavior, the originally normal market supply suddenly appears excessive. The inventory of commercial enterprises has significantly increased, with an overstock of about 50 billion yuan.

The second reason is the influence of consumption behavior.

Reform has made a part of the population "rich first," creating some income gaps. However, the tendency towards equal consumption still strongly manifests, with a new form of roughly equal consumption in tiers. People transitioning from "subsistence level" to "moderate prosperity" have income gaps but not significant ones, forming a "wave-like" consumption model. High-end consumer goods are either unaffordable for everyone or affordable for those in the same tier. Currently, the urban color TV penetration rate is 57.6%; the urban refrigerator penetration rate is around 50%, with Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou exceeding 80%. China is a low-income developing country, but its high-end consumer goods penetration rate is at the level of a middle-income country. The current problem is that the wave of affluent families buying high-end goods has passed, and those who want to buy lack the funds, causing a temporary gap in purchasing power for high-end goods.

China's market capacity is large, but it also has the characteristics of multiple purchasing entities (11 billion people) and low per capita purchasing power. With a retail volume of over 7,000 billion yuan, the average per person is only a few hundred yuan. Additionally, consumers have a strong tendency towards comparison and conformity, rushing to buy when there is a buying frenzy and not buying when there is no frenzy. With 11 billion people, a buying frenzy can create a huge wave; but if each person spends 1 jiao less per day, 400 billion yuan worth of goods will not be realized in a year.

Q: I think last year's base is large, which also has an impact on this year.

A: Yes, the large base is the third reason I want to mention.

Last year, four rounds of buying frenzies occurred, with the forward purchase of durable consumer goods and the excessive purchase of essential goods accumulating, making the retail volume of commodities 27.8% higher than in 1987. This has a lagging impact on this year. On one hand, consumers have accumulated goods at home, realizing this year's and even the next few years' purchasing power in advance; on the other hand, with the large base, maintaining last year's level is already difficult, and increasing it is even more challenging. In August this year, the retail volume of commodities decreased by 0.7% compared to August last year, reaching a low point in many years; however, August last year increased by 40.1% compared to August the previous year, reaching a peak in 40 years. If based on the previous year, the average growth rate for these two Augusts is 19.6%, which is still not low.

The fourth reason is the structural problem.

Currently, the market has both surplus and shortage. On one hand, some goods are ignored on the counter, and some goods are not even lucky enough to be on the counter, only able to "sleep" in the factory warehouse; on the other hand, the goods that the people need are either too expensive to buy or out of stock.

The fifth reason is the beginning of the diversion of purchasing power.

With the development of commodity economy, many things that were not "commodities" have also entered the "commodity family," among which the impact is relatively large is the commodification of housing. According to a sample survey, in August this year, the average expenditure of Shenzhen residents on purchasing commercial housing was 104.83 yuan per person, accounting for 28.9% of monthly expenditure. Farmers building new houses is even more common. Additionally, the diversification of financial assets, individuals purchasing stocks and bonds; businesspeople conducting investments, converting consumption funds into production funds; some people traveling self-funded; some people shifting from pursuing material enjoyment to pursuing cultural and entertainment enjoyment; some schools recruiting self-funded students, individuals investing in intelligence, etc. All these have absorbed a large amount of currency. In the first half of this year, the non-commodity expenditure of urban and rural residents reached 60 billion yuan, an increase of 33% compared to last year.

Tightening has not yet reached the target, and "double tightening" cannot be relaxed

Q: Market weakness has already had some adverse effects on production. The industrial growth rate in September was 0.9%, and some people are calling for easing the monetary policy. What is your opinion?

A: One of the reasons for the low growth rate in September is that the growth rate was too high in September last year. The actual production level is still not low, and the average daily output in September this year increased by 5.6% compared to August.

Currently, the rectification and adjustment have just achieved initial results, and tightening has not yet reached the target. The "double tightening" policy cannot be easily relaxed. The current foundation for supply and demand easing is still fragile, and consumers' psychology is not stable. In the context of total imbalance and structural imbalance, any slight disturbance can easily reverse psychological expectations. Overall, the main problem of China's economy is a shortage economy, not overproduction. Therefore, our main task is to control inflation, and the focus of defense is still to prevent buying frenzies. The previous rounds of tightening have told us that tightening must reach the required intensity. If it is only superficial and easily relaxed, due to the rebound effect of tightening, it often leads to greater inflation. We have lessons from 1985, 1986, and 1988.

Due to the long-term overheating of the economy, we have become accustomed to a tense market environment and feel suddenly shocked by the temporary sales weakness. In fact, a certain degree of market fluctuation is a normal phenomenon of commodity economy and a necessary effect of rectification and adjustment, and there is no need to panic too much.

Control the total amount and adjust the structure to get out of the dilemma

Q: What measures should we take?

A: We must persevere, withstand pressure, and adjust the structure under the premise of controlling the total amount. This is the only way for us to get out of the dilemma.

In the past few years, we have been shouting about adjustment every year, but there has been no substantial progress. Now, the total amount tightening has brought about market easing, providing a good opportunity for structural adjustment. We must learn from the lessons of previous rounds of tightening and stopping halfway, and this time the tightening must reach the required intensity. We must be determined to push enterprises into a competitive environment to survive the fittest, and even be prepared to painfully eliminate a part of the enterprises. Because without "eliminating the inferior," it is difficult to "support the superior," which is the price we must pay to achieve the rationalization of the economic structure.

The initial effect of the first phase of tightening has appeared, and now the rectification and adjustment have entered the key stage of focusing on structural adjustment and improving efficiency. The current urgent task is to adjust the credit structure according to the requirements of industrial policy. In response to the serious impact of the triangular debt caused by market weakness on enterprise production, a certain amount of startup funds can be arranged. We must learn from the lessons of previous "startups" that did not "move," and this time we must focus on the "art of startup." First, we must choose the appropriate startup point. The startup point for the production of production materials should be selected from large and medium-sized backbone enterprises, especially basic industry enterprises. The startup point for the production of consumer goods should be mainly in the circulation sector, which should select and purchase goods based on market conditions, playing the role of a "reservoir" for absorbing and releasing goods. Commerce should strengthen regional coordination work, and currently focus on sending industrial products to the countryside to change the situation of more in cities and less in the countryside. Seasonal coordination should also be done well. For important raw materials and necessities of life that currently seem to be in surplus but may become tight in the future, a certain amount can be stored. For staple foods like grains, which have a single quality, the futures trading system should be adopted. Second, there should be an appropriate startup force, too large or too small is not good. Fortunately, the currency issuance has been initially controlled this year, and a certain amount of funds can be allocated. Third, the startup should not be all at once, but should be done in phases and batches, and followed up with management. Money should follow the goods, and new arrears should also be prevented.

Q: What are your thoughts on the price issue?

A: The important factor for the current market easing is the easing of the price increase trend, and inflation must still be controlled to prevent psychological fluctuations. For long-term unsold goods, prices can be appropriately reduced, but care must be taken not to stimulate high consumption.

Q: Some people advocate the abolition of value-preserving savings. What do you think?

A: Value-preserving savings cannot be abolished. Currently, the interest rate of value-preserving savings seems high, but it is actually raised by inflation. In the context of the fragile foundation for supply and demand easing, savings must be stabilized. Value-preserving savings have been implemented for just one year and cannot be changed frequently, otherwise, it will be difficult to gain the trust of the people. Our main effort should be focused on controlling inflation. If inflation is brought down, the value-preserving interest rate will naturally come down. In fact, due to the easing of price increases this year, the value-preserving subsidy rate for the fourth quarter has been reduced from 13.64% to 8.36%. When the price index is continuously below the fixed 3-year term savings interest rate for three years, value-preserving savings will naturally disappear.

　　国务院发展研究中心负责人答记者问
　　治理整顿取得初步成果
　　市场疲软是阶段性效应
    新华社北京10月26日电　最近，国务院发展研究中心负责人就当前我国经济形势回答了新华社记者提出的问题，为人们观察经济形势提供了一些可供参考和研究的材料与观点。
    如何看待当前经济形势？
    问：请您谈谈对当前经济形势的看法。
    答：经济形势正朝着我们预料的方向发展，治理整顿工作取得了阶段性的初步成果。过高的工业增长速度明显回落，固定资产投资有所控制，物价上涨势头趋缓，货币回笼情况较好，人们对涨价的预期逐渐平复。所有这些都证明，党的十三届三中全会确定的治理整顿、深化改革的方针是正确的。
    问：现在人们都非常关心市场问题，我们还是从市场谈起吧。
    答：前几年，我国市场供应一直相当紧张，今年却发生了新变化：高档消费品由“热”趋“冷”；生活必需品由“旺”趋“平”；一般日用消费品由“俏”趋“滞”。1—9月社会商品零售额6073亿元，名义上比去年同期增长12.3％，但扣除涨价因素实际却是下降8.2％。如果没有特殊情况，第四季度市场销售预期难有大的起色，全年商品销售实际将是负增长。这种情况只有1961、1962和1968年发生过。
    生产资料市场也有了缓和。上半年全国物资供销企业购进生产资料1570亿元，销售1681亿元，剔除物价因素，分别比去年同期下降14.9％和22.8％。
    市场疲软有五个原因
    问：引起市场疲软的原因有哪些？
    答：第一个原因，可以说主要原因是治理整顿的第一阶段性效应。
    一系列紧缩措施在控制需求方面开始见效。国家初步控制住了银行贷款规模和货币发行。压缩固定资产投资取得一定成绩。清理项目削减的投资大约减少270亿元的消费需求。1—9月全民单位完成投资1261亿元，比去年同期下降7.2％，如果考虑价格因素，实际压缩了20％以上。社会集团购买力得到初步控制，1—9月社会集团购买消费品521亿元，比去年同期仅增长6.2％，如果剔除价格因素实际下降很多。
    在压缩需求的同时，我们还特别注意增加有效供给。今年前9个月的工业速度为8.9％，市场旺销的产品都有增长。夏粮、早稻合计比去年增产351万吨。同往年相比，今年供给的增幅不算很大，但是压缩需求本身就相应增加了供给。
    人们的消费倾向减弱，储蓄倾向增强。特别是保值储蓄对群众的吸引力很大，今年头9个月储蓄存款净增1000亿元，相当于去年同期的两倍多，是40年来的高峰，这里面有80％左右是保值储蓄。
    今年物价涨势趋缓，月环比指数呈下降之势，消费者的“涨价感”不强，通货膨胀预期减弱，消费心理逐步恢复正常。人们从几次抢购中吸取了教训，从盲目地抢购变为理智地选购。而且去年价格节节上升，今年价格看跌，消费者反而产生观望心理。
    需求减少，供给增加，特别是由于消费者购买行为变化很大，使得本来正常的市场供给突然显得过大。工商企业库存明显增加，其中超储部分500亿元左右。
    第二个原因是消费行为的影响。
    改革使一部分人“先富起来”，收入拉开了一定差距。但是，消费均等倾向仍顽强地表现出来，新的表现形式是分档次的大体平均。从“温饱型”向“小康型”过渡的人们收入虽有差距但差距不大，这就形成“排浪式”的消费模式。高档消费品，要么是大家都买不起，要么是同一档次的人都买得起。现在城市的彩电普及率57.6％；城市的冰箱普及率在50％左右，其中京、津、沪、穗在80％以上。我国是低收入的发展中国家，在高档消费品普及率上却相当于中等收入国家的水平。目前的问题是：殷实人家购买高档商品的浪潮已经过去，想买的人心有余而钱不足，高档商品的购买力量一时出现青黄不接的现象。
    我国市场容量虽然很大，但同时还具有购买主体多（11亿人口），人均购买力低等特点，7000多亿元的零售额，平均每人不过几百元。加上消费者的攀比心理和趋同倾向比较强，抢购时一哄而上，不买时又一哄而下。11亿人口，抢购风潮涌来足以卷起巨澜；可是每人每天少花1角钱，1年就有400多亿元商品的价值得不到实现。
    问：我看去年基数大，对今年也有影响。
    答：对，基数大是我要说的第三个原因。
    去年一年掀起四次抢购风潮，耐用消费品的超前购买和生活必需品的超量购买汇集起来，使商品零售额比1987年增长27.8％。这对今年产生滞后影响。一方面，消费者家里积存的东西多，提前实现了今年甚至今后几年的购买力；另一方面基数大了，在购买心理恢复正常的情况下，保持去年水平已经不容易，若想增长更为困难。今年8月商品零售额比去年8月下降0.7％，是多年来的低谷；但是去年8月比前年8月增长40.1％，是40年来的巅峰。如果以前年为基础的话，这两年8月的平均增幅是19.6％，还是不低的。
    第四个原因是结构问题。
    现在市场是积压与短缺并存。一方面有的商品摆在柜台遭人冷落，有的商品甚至还没有这种“幸运”，只好躲在工厂仓库“睡大觉”；另一方面，群众需要的东西不是价格贵买不起，就是脱销断档买不到。
    第五个原因是购买力开始分流。
    随着商品经济的发展，许多原来不“姓”商品的东西也投入“商品大家庭”的怀抱，其中影响比较大的是住房商品化。据抽样调查，今年8月深圳居民购买商品房人均支出104.83元，占月支出的28.9％。农民建新房更多。另外，金融资产多样化，个人购买股票、债券；工商业者进行投资，将消费基金转化为生产资金；一些人自费旅游；有的人从追求物质享受转向追求文化娱乐等精神享受；一些院校招收自费学生，个人花钱进行智力投资，等等。这些都吸纳了大量货币。今年上半年城乡居民的非商品性支出达600亿元，比去年上升33％。
    紧缩尚未到位，“双紧”不能放松
    问：市场疲软对生产已经产生了某些不利的影响，9月份我国工业速度为0.9％，有人呼吁放松银根。您有什么看法？
    答：9月份速度低的原因之一是去年9月速度过高。实际生产水平还不低，今年9月平均日产值比8月还增长5.6％。
    现在，治理整顿刚刚取得阶段性成效，紧缩还没有到位，“双紧”方针不能轻易放松。目前供求缓和的基础仍很脆弱，消费者的心理尚不稳定，在总量失衡、结构失调的大环境下，一有风吹草动，心理预期很容易逆转。就总体来看，我国经济的主要问题是短缺经济，不是生产过剩。所以，我们的主要任务是控制通货膨胀，防御的重点还是防止抢购风潮。前几次的紧缩告诉我们，紧缩必须达到应有的力度，如果只是浅尝辄止、稍紧即松的话，由于紧缩力反弹的影响，往往会造成更大的膨胀。这方面我们1985、1986、1988年是有教训的。
    由于经济长期过热，我们习惯了紧张的市场环境，对暂时的销售疲软一时感到突然。其实，市场一定程度的波动是商品经济的正常现象，也是治理整顿必然出现的效应，不必过分慌张。
  控制总量、调整结构是摆脱困境唯一出路
    问：我们应该采取什么对策？
    答：硬着头皮，顶着压力，在控制总量的前提下切实调整结构，这是我们摆脱困境的唯一出路。
    过去几年我们年年喊调整，年年没有实质性进展。现在总量紧缩带来的市场缓和为结构调整提供了良好的契机。我们要吸取前几次紧缩半途而废的教训，这次紧缩一定要达到应有的力度，下决心把企业推在竞争的环境中优胜劣汰，甚至不惜忍痛淘汰一部分企业。因为不“限劣”就难以“扶优”，这是实现经济结构合理化必须付出的代价。
    紧缩的第一阶段效应已经出现了，现在治理整顿已经进入了以调整结构和提高效益为重点的关键阶段。当前的迫切任务是按照产业政策的要求来调整信贷结构。针对市场疲软引起的三角债严重影响企业生产的情况，可以安排一部分启动资金。要吸取过去几次“启”而不“动”的教训，这次要讲究“启动艺术”。首先要选择恰当的启动点。生产资料生产的启动点应该选在大中型骨干企业，特别是基础工业企业。消费品生产的启动点应该以流通部门为主，由流通部门根据市场情况择优进货，发挥吞吐商品的“蓄水池”作用。商业要加强地区调剂工作，当前要抓紧工业品下乡，改变城多乡少的状况。还要搞好季节调剂，对目前表面上显得偏多、今后又可能趋紧的重要原材料和生活必需品，可以多储存一部分。对谷类等品质单一的大宗货物应该采取期货贸易制度。其次要有适度的启动力，太大太小都不行。好在今年货币投放这一头初步控制住了，可以拿出一定的资金。第三，启动不能全线启动，要有先有后，分期分批进行，并跟踪管理，钱随物走，同时还要注意防止新的拖欠。
    问：您对物价问题有什么想法？
    答：现在市场缓和的重要因素是物价涨势趋缓，还是要控制住通货膨胀，以免引起心理波动。对于长期滞销的商品可以适当降价，但是要注意不要刺激高消费。
    问：有人主张取消保值储蓄，您怎么看？
    答：保值储蓄不能取消。现在保值储蓄利率看来很高，其实是被通货膨胀抬高的。在供求缓和的基础还很脆弱的情况下，一定要稳住储蓄。保值储蓄实行刚刚一年，不能变动频繁，不然很难取信于民。我们的主要精力应该放在控制通货膨胀上，如果把通货膨胀压下来的话，保值利率就自然降下来了。事实上，由于今年价格涨势趋缓，第四季度的保值贴补率已经由13.64％降为8.36％。当物价指数连续3年都在定期3年期储蓄利率以下的时候，保值储蓄就自然消失了。
