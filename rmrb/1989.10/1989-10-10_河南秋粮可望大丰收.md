The vast majority of farmers in Henan Province, a major grain-producing region in China, have completed the delivery of their summer harvest. Now, they are welcoming another promising autumn season. Currently, corn is ripe across large areas of Henan, and rice harvesting has begun in the south. With 65.73 million mu (approximately 4.38 million hectares) of autumn grain already secured, a bumper harvest is assured. The province's total grain output for the year is expected to set a new historical record.

The Henan Provincial Agricultural Survey Team has preliminarily analyzed the data and predicts that the province's autumn grain yield will reach 13.92 billion kilograms. Combined with the record-high summer grain yield, the total annual grain output is expected to reach 30 billion kilograms.
