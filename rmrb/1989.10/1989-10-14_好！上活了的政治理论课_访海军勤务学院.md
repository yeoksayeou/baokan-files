Located on the banks of the Hai River in Tianjin, the Naval Logistics Academy is a military academy that trains junior logistics command officers and technical management officers for the navy. In recent years, this academy has gained fame throughout the military for its political theory courses, which are highly popular among students. Its "theoretical teaching, social practice, and extracurricular life" three-in-one Marxist theory teaching system recently won the first prize for teaching achievements in the entire military.

Stimulating Students' Interest

Dian Jia Cheng, a second-year student in the Military Supply Department, hails from Liaoning's Tieling City. He has served in the military and has broad experience. Previously, he had attended political theory courses in middle school and in the army. After enrolling in the Naval Logistics Academy last year, he attended political theory courses again. He said, "I originally thought political courses were nothing special. You attend the class, read the book, and memorize for the exam. The first political theory course we studied was the history of the Chinese Revolution. In the first class, the instructor, with rich knowledge and vivid teaching, attracted me. By the end of the first week, my classmates gathered to chat, and we all agreed that the political theory course was the most enjoyable. By the end of the second week, everyone still unanimously agreed that the political theory course was the most attractive." This is not mere flattery. Among the freshmen who entered the school in 1987, there were initially 67 who did not want to attend political theory courses. However, after attending a few classes, they developed an interest. In October 1987, the higher authorities conducted an anonymous survey of nearly 700 students, with 96.7% expressing satisfaction and welcome for the political theory courses.

Liu Tian Guang, a third-year student in the Military Supply Department, said, "Our political theory courses do not require us to memorize the book. If it were about memorizing, my brain is quite good at it, but that does not solve the problem. The instructors teach us theory closely related to reality, and they also guide us to conduct social practices, teaching us to use the Marxist theory we have learned to analyze and solve real problems." He recounted an incident. Last winter vacation, the instructor asked him to conduct a social survey in the countryside of Jinzhou District, Dalian City. He saw that after implementing the household contract responsibility system, agricultural production developed rapidly, and farmers became wealthy, with significant results. However, it was strange that a considerable number of farmers did not want to continue with the "household contract" system and voluntarily pooled their land to engage in "scale management." Liu Tian Guang was puzzled: Was the reform of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas correct? He went to consult farmers and rural cadres, who said, "One family farming is not good, it's a small-scale operation," "It is easy to engage in short-term behavior." Since scale management is good, why not implement it in all rural areas? Wasn't rural reform before the "scale management"? Why did they implement the "household contract" system a few years ago? He felt that he could not explain it logically. After returning to school, he went to consult the political theory instructor. The instructor analyzed this issue based on the Marxist basic principle that production relations must adapt to the development of productive forces, saying: The household contract responsibility system adapts to the level of agricultural productive forces in most parts of China at present, thus significantly promoting the development of production. In some places, agricultural productive forces have developed rapidly, and the original household contract responsibility system is no longer suitable, and production relations need to be further adjusted. Therefore, some rural areas implement scale management. This is precisely the result of the household contract responsibility system promoting production development in the past few years. The level of production development varies in different places. At present, most places are suitable for continuing the household contract responsibility system and cannot all implement scale management. After such an analysis, Liu Tian Guang felt enlightened, and the Marxist basic principle deeply rooted in his mind, deepening his understanding of reform and the party's policies, and arousing his greater interest in studying national conditions and Marxist theory.

Not Just for Passing Exams

Wang Wei Dong, a third-year student in the Port Engineering Department, entered the Naval Logistics Academy directly from high school. He learned some basic principles from high school political theory courses, but they were incomplete and shallow. "I feel that high school political courses are mainly for passing the college entrance examination," he said. "The teacher teaches according to the exam scope, finishes the lesson, and leaves. We do not understand some problems, and the teacher also answers some, but some problems we are very interested in, the teacher does not teach, saying it's 'out of scope,' the exam will not test, telling us not to waste time. Now we study political theory courses not just to pass exams, but to improve our ideological, theoretical, and political levels, to solve real-life problems. We also have exams now, but it's not about memorizing the book, it's about testing our ability to analyze and solve problems, which has become something we are very interested in."

Today's military academies are not closed off; students have extensive connections with society. The entire school receives over a thousand letters from outside the school every month. Many issues in society also constantly bother them. Price issues, problems in reform and opening up, how their hometowns develop, negative phenomena in society, some officials' improper conduct, various trends, etc., they all want to understand and find answers. And the political theory courses in this academy do not "avoid" these issues, always providing various background materials to them in a timely manner, teaching them the correct theories and methods to think about problems, guiding them to conduct social surveys and participate in social practices, benefiting them greatly. The instructors believe that the establishment of all correct thoughts ultimately depends on the students' own thinking and exploration. They have set up a "Political Theory Special Study Room" for the students, where there are a large number of books and materials, various theoretical dynamics information, over 100 teaching videotapes, and "Question Board" and "Answer Board." Students can raise any questions, and instructors will respond, and students can also provide their own answers, repeatedly questioning some issues. During conversations with the students, the reporter asked, "Where do you like to go the most during your free time?" They unanimously said, "The Political Theory Special Study Room." Indeed, during free time, that place is always crowded, and the academy has to arrange schedules to limit the number of people entering at a time. The reporter deeply felt that in this academy, the vast majority of students do not just passively accept indoctrination in political theory but actively and eagerly pursue the truth of Marxism. Therefore, they have a strong sense of social responsibility and historical mission, but no impractical fantasies; they firmly oppose corrupt phenomena in society, but have no complaints or cold indifference; they support reform and opening up, but have no empty theories or admiration for Western society, and the bourgeois liberalization trend has difficulty finding a market here.

Teaching Content Keeps Pace with the Times

The reporter had multiple conversations with Bo Ke Ran, the political commissar of this academy. He is an experienced and respected old soldier.

"Running a school and cultivating people, political direction is the first priority," said Political Commissar Bo. "Our work is still not enough, but we have always been clear about placing the firm and correct political direction in the first place." He used sea navigation as an analogy: "Technology and business, of course, must be very precise, but if the direction is wrong, even if the technology and business are precise, it will be of no use, and it may even have the opposite effect. Political theory courses, Marxist theory teaching, are to provide the correct direction. We try our best to support political theory teaching."

The leadership of this academy does not just express their support for political theory courses in words or on paper but takes concrete actions, often with the academy president and political commissar personally creating conditions for political theory teachers. Seven or eight years ago, when rural economic reforms were booming, the political courses were still teaching "three-level ownership, team as the base," and the outdated teaching content made the students uninterested and unwilling to listen. However, changing the content of political courses is a very serious matter, and the teachers, although aware of the disconnect from reality, dared not cross the line. The academy party committee encouraged the teachers to boldly update the teaching content, reflecting the party's new thoughts in the new era in teaching. The academy's funds were limited, but they did their best to support political teachers to go out of the school to conduct large-scale social surveys. Over the past seven or eight years, political teachers have conducted surveys in more than 200 instances across 14 provinces and cities in dozens of counties and cities, obtaining various new information about reforms and opening up in society. The theoretical and academic activities that the teachers learned about, the academy also tried to let them participate in, keeping up with the theoretical dynamics. On this basis, the political teachers updated the teaching content of the 13 courses they opened by a large margin. The teachers proposed establishing a "Political Theory Special Study Room," and the academy fully supported it, equipping it as a school-level experimental room. The academy also established contacts with six units, including Daqiuzhuang, Tianjin Port, and Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, to build six social practice bases for political theory courses, inviting the responsible persons and experts from these units as part-time professors. When these units send people, the president and political commissar always personally receive them. The political course teachers all understand that without the support and attention of the academy leadership, the political theory courses in this academy would not have achieved today's results.

"The political theory course should be very attractive and should make people very interested," said Political Commissar Bo. "If it is not attractive, students do not like it, it will not have the expected educational effect, and it is said to place the correct political direction first, but in reality, it will not be achieved. If it is like this, first of all, it is the responsibility of our academy leadership."

Learning from Social Practice

More than 50 years ago, Mao Zedong wrote "On Practice" in the cave dwellings of Yan'an, pointing out that Marxist theory has two characteristics: class nature and practicality. More than 50 years later, this proposition still shines with the light of truth. Many people's confusion and "crisis of faith" in theory, and deviation from the path, are important reasons for forgetting these two characteristics. For Marxist theory teaching, it is particularly important to grasp these two characteristics. In the Naval Logistics Academy, it can be clearly felt that the teaching and learning of political theory courses grasp these two characteristics. This is also the main reason for their effectiveness. Grasping the class nature is mainly reflected in their firm rejection and convincing criticism of the bourgeois liberalization trend. This also depends on adhering to the principle of practicality. Without adhering to the principle of practicality, the class nature and combativeness of Marxist theory will become empty talk. The leadership and political theory teachers of the Naval Logistics Academy attach great importance to the principle of practicality, leaving a deep impression on people.

First of all, the political theory teachers themselves invest in the social practice of reform and opening up to learn again, personally experiencing the great practice of our party and people in the new historical period. All 21 teachers in the teaching and research office have gone out for surveys multiple times. They have come into contact with almost all major issues in today's Chinese society, and some teachers have participated in the forefront of discussions and explorations of certain issues. It is precisely this personal practice that has enabled these political theory teachers to gain rich knowledge about contemporary Chinese society, accumulate more than 3 million words of materials, understand the new developments of Marxism in contemporary China, and also gain the motivation and courage to reform Marxist theory teaching. They have updated the teaching content 7 times, adding new courses such as "The Development of Marxism in Contemporary Times," "Theoretical Issues in Reform and Opening Up," and "The Challenge of Modern Western Thought to Marxism," and also opened lectures such as "The Hotspots of Youth Thinking in the Great Wave of Reform and the Exploration of Marxism," and "Philosophical Issues in Reform," increasing the political theory courses to 13, and making them look completely new. The social practice of the teachers is still ongoing, keeping their courses always fresh.

Although the political course content is new and the teaching is lively, students are very welcome, but if students do not directly contact social reality, then the political theory course is still "lame," and it cannot achieve the expected effect. Political Commissar Bo Ke Ran said, "We are worried that students only read books and do not contact reality, becoming bookworms and getting stuck in corners. We cannot cultivate bookworms and must let them participate in social practice." The head of the Political Theory Teaching and Research Office, Lecturer Li Shu Lin, introduced to the reporter, "Once after the vacation, the students returned to school and raised 200 questions about real life. We analyzed and found that 60% of the theories and similar cases involved in these questions had been taught in class, but when students encountered specific problems, many still could not use the learned theories to analyze and draw conclusions. Of course, real life is relatively complex. This shows that organizing students to directly participate in social practice is very necessary." Therefore, they included students' social practice as an important part of political theory teaching, incorporating it into the teaching plan.

Setting Classrooms in the Vast World

Students' social practice mainly includes the following two methods:

Vacation social surveys. Before each vacation, the political teaching and research office assigns survey tasks and requirements to the students, arranges time, and the students submit survey reports after returning to school, which are used as assessment criteria.

Establishing social practice bases. The academy surveyed more than 50 nearby units and, based on teaching needs, selected 6 units to establish stable contacts as practice bases, including Tianjin Valve Factory, Tianjin New Port, New Port Shipyard, Tianjin Alkali Factory, Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Daqiuzhuang. The teachers, based on the teaching progress and the questions raised by the students, organize the students to visit and survey the bases, inviting the responsible persons from the bases to give lectures to the students. Over the years, more than 10,000 students have visited and studied at the bases, conducting 67 special surveys. When the reporter visited, a batch of students happened to go to the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone to understand the issue of introducing foreign capital, and they went together. Some students did not understand the recent signing of a land lease agreement in the development zone, and some asked, "What is the difference between this and the concessions of old China?" The head of the CPC Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone Work Committee Office is a part-time professor of the Naval Logistics Academy. He introduced in detail from the perspective of China's policy of opening up to the outside world, the content of the lease agreement, and international practices the great significance of this lease for China's economy, technology, and foreign trade, not only making the students understand that this lease is fundamentally different from the concessions of old China but also increasing their knowledge about introducing foreign capital, further recognizing the correctness of the policy of opening up to the outside world.

Social practice allows students to personally experience what the party is doing, what the people are doing, understand what they should do and how to do it, and have a better understanding of national conditions, knowing that our party and people have so many innovations and still have so many problems to solve, inspiring them to think, prompting them to use the basic principles of Marxism to analyze problems and draw correct conclusions. In this way, the theory learned is solid. The students have written more than 3,000 social practice reports, and the reporter read a few. A student in the Military Port Engineering Department analyzed and investigated the products of several economic and technological development zones, using rich data to point out that the product structure of the development zones has defects, with many labor-intensive products and few high-value-added products, proposing to develop more high-tech enterprises, which is very convincing. Four students separately investigated Tianjin Port Container Company and Tianjin Alkali Factory, proposing several views on how to improve enterprise efficiency in the face of a significant increase in production costs, which are reasonable and have a certain theoretical depth and practical value. Many students also, based on their own social practice experience, launched the "I Contribute a Plan for My Hometown's Reform and Prosperity" activity, providing advice to the local government of their hometown, some of which were adopted, and even achieved results.

Many places of higher education come to the Naval Logistics Academy to learn about the reform experience of political theory course teaching. They both praise and envy the political theory teaching practice base of this school but feel it is difficult to imitate because it is difficult to find enterprises and units willing to take on this responsibility. In addition, school funds are also insufficient. This is indeed a problem. People ask the Naval Logistics Academy, "How did you establish such a relationship?" They replied, "First, it relies on the enthusiasm of these units for the cause of education; second, it relies on mutual support. We have some advantages in knowledge, helping them learn Marxist theory and management knowledge, helping them train cadres, providing them with information consulting and technical services."

Political Course Teachers: A Special Profession

It is not easy to make students voluntarily and actively pursue the truth of Marxism in political theory courses. The teaching content must be new, the teaching methods must be lively, participation in social practice, etc., are all necessary. However, all of these must be implemented by political course teachers. All reforms in political courses ultimately increase the workload of political teachers, which is very different from other subject teachers. Academy President Peng Qian Sheng said:

"We are happy that our political course teacher team is very good. We have three requirements for them: first, they must be good at conducting social surveys; second, they must have the best possible theoretical cultivation; third, they must be good at doing students' ideological work. They all work very hard."

The political theory course is indeed different from other subjects. It is a science about people and is closely related to people's thoughts and daily lives. If it is detached from people's daily lives and thoughts, especially the "hotspots" in people's thoughts, political theory will become a tree without roots and a spring without a source. The special nature of political theory courses determines the special nature of the profession of political theory teachers. The political teachers of the Naval Logistics Academy are very aware of the special nature of their profession, and they face difficulties and fulfill their duties.

They extend their business to the daily life field of the students, with each person fixedly connected to a class, participating in the students' weekly class affairs meeting, and doing ideological and political work with other political workers. In this regard, they have theoretical advantages, and for the students' daily life problems, such as the frequent marriage and love problems encountered by the students, they can analyze and guide them from a deeper level, which is convincing. They have established deep feelings with the students, and the students trust them very much, all willing to tell them their inner thoughts and personal life secrets. The students say, "Our political course teachers are not 'only seen during class, not found after class,' but are always by our side, they are our mentors and friends in life."

Always being with the students, they can indeed understand the students more, but at the same time, their personal character, thoughts, and moral conduct will also be exposed to the students. The students not only listen to the theory they teach on the podium, not only see their image on the podium, but also see their image in daily life. If there is a big difference between the two, even if the theory they teach is good, it will lose its luster in the students' minds. This is also the special nature of the political teacher profession. Therefore, political course teachers should be people of high character, people who are consistent in words and deeds, and the so-called "role model," which is more important for them. It is commendable that the political theory teaching and research office teachers of the Naval Logistics Academy do a good job and are worthy of the title of political course teachers. The head of the teaching and research office, Li Shu Lin, said, "We demand of ourselves: we must truly believe in, truly understand, and truly practice Marxism. These are endless, and we will strive continuously." This is a very high demand, and they are indeed striving to practice it. During the interview, the reporter learned about many touching examples. Professor Li Chang Yi is the oldest teacher in the teaching and research office, already 60 years old. Once, a new student asked him, "You teach others Marxism, do you truly believe it?" He sincerely said, "I have taught Marxism-Leninism for more than 30 years. If I do not believe it, isn't it equivalent to deceiving myself for a lifetime?" The students know that Professor Li is serious in his studies and is not a person who deceives himself. His wife works in the urban area of Tianjin, and they can only meet once a week, but he insists on returning to the school every Saturday night to participate in the students' class affairs meeting. The students are very moved, saying, "The old teacher participates in our class affairs meeting, without saying a word, just sitting there, and our ideological problems are solved half." Associate Professor Sun Yu Cai's father passed away, and he only stayed at home for one night, returning to the school early the next morning, and consecutively taught for 3 days. He is not without filial piety, saying, "On one side is the funeral of my father, and on the other side are 80 students waiting for me to teach, I have no choice." He is not in good health, and standing for a long time makes his bones ache, but he insists on teaching while standing. The students moved him to bring a stool, asking him to sit and teach. He said, "Standing to teach has a better effect," and refused to sit down. The students were so moved that they all stood up, saying, "You don't sit down, we also stand to listen!" He then sat down.

In the eyes of the students, the "podium image" of their political course teachers and their image in life are merged. Daily life has become another classroom for the students to study Marxist theory.

The reform of political theory teaching in the Naval Logistics Academy has continued for seven or eight years. During this period, more than 4,000 students have graduated, and they have gone to the sea, ports, bases, and other positions in naval logistics work. Many of them have led troops. They are proficient in logistics business and are also good at doing ideological and political work, receiving praise from the troops.

The Hai River flows day and night by this school, heading towards the sea, and the political theory teaching of this school is also constantly reforming, advancing, and progressing. (Accompanying photos)

    好！上活了的政治理论课
    ——访海军勤务学院
    本报记者  毕全忠
    位于天津海河边的海军勤务学院，是一所培养海军后勤初级指挥军官和技术管理军官的军事学院。近几年来，这所学院以政治理论课深受学员欢迎而闻名全军。它创造的“理论教学、社会实践、业余生活三大课堂的马克思主义理论教学体系”，最近获得全军教学成果一等奖。
    唤起学员的浓厚兴趣
    军需专业二年级学员田家成来自辽宁铁岭市，又已当过兵，见识颇广。以前在中学、在部队都上过政治理论课，去年考入勤务学院后又上政治理论课。他说：“我原以为政治课没有什么，上课，看看书，考试就背背书。我们学的第一门政治理论课是中国革命史。第一堂课，教员就以丰富的知识、生动的讲授把我吸引住了。第一个星期结束，同学们聚在一起闲谈，不约而同地都说政治理论课是最爱听的课。第二个星期结束，大家还是一致认为政治理论课最吸引人。我们很多同学都是进了勤务学院后才产生对政治理论课的浓厚兴趣的。”这并非溢美之辞。1987年考入该校的新生中，开始有67名不愿听政治理论课，可是听了一二课后就产生了兴趣。1987年10月，上级机关对该校近700名学员作了不记名的答卷调查，结果是对政治理论课表示“满意”、“欢迎”的达96.7％。
    军需专业三年级学员刘天广说：“我们的政治理论课不是叫我们背书。要说背书，我的脑瓜很能背，但这不解决问题。教员给我们讲理论是紧密联系实际的，还要我们进行社会实践，教我们用学到的马克思主义理论去分析解决实际问题。”他讲了一件事。前年寒假，教员叫他在家乡大连市金州区农村作社会调查。他看到这里实行家庭承包的农业生产责任制后，经济发展很快，农民们富起来了，效果非常显著。可是奇怪的是相当多的农民不愿意继续实行“包产到户”了，又自愿把土地合在一起搞“规模经营”。刘天广产生了疑惑：农村实行家庭承包责任制这一改革对不对呢？他去请教农民和农村干部，他们说：“一家一户种地搞小而全，不好”，“容易产生短期行为”。既然规模经营好，为什么不在所有农村实行？农村改革前不就是“规模经营”吗，为什么前几年要搞“包产到户”？他感到道理上说不清楚，回校后他去请教政治理论课教员。教员根据生产关系要适应生产力的发展这一马克思主义基本原理分析这个问题，说：家庭承包责任制适应了我国目前大部分地区农业生产力的水平，因此明显地促进了生产的发展。有些地方农业生产力发展很快，原来的家庭承包责任制又不大适应了，要继续调整生产关系，因此有些农村实行规模经营。这正是前几年实行家庭承包责任制促进了生产发展的结果。各地生产发展水平不同，从目前情况看，多数地方适合继续实行家庭承包责任制，还不能都搞规模经营。这样一分析，刘天广感到豁然开朗，马克思主义这一基本原理在脑子里深深地扎下了根，加深了对改革和对党的政策的理解，也引起了他对研究国情和学习马克思主义理论的更大的兴趣。
    不是为了应付考试
    港湾工程专业三年级学员王卫东是从高中直接考入勤务学院的。高中的政治理论课使他学到了一些基本道理，但是很不完备，很不深入。“我感到现在高中政治课主要是为应付高考。”他说，“老师根据高考的范围讲，讲完就走。我们不明白的问题，老师也解答一些，但是有些我们很感兴趣的问题老师却不讲，说是‘超纲’，高考不会考，叫我们不要浪费时间。现在我们学政治理论课不是为了应付考试，而是为了提高自己的思想、理论、政治的水平，是为了解决生活中的实际问题。我们现在也考试，但不是背书，而是考我们分析、解决问题的能力，这成了我们很有兴趣的事了。”
    如今的军事院校决不是封闭的，学员们与社会上有广泛的联系。全校学员每月收到校外的来信总有千封以上。社会上的不少问题也在不断地困扰着他们。物价问题，改革开放中的问题，家乡怎么发展，社会上的不良现象，一些干部的不正之风，形形色色的思潮等等，他们总想弄个明白，找到答案。而这所学院的政治理论课对这些问题都不“绕着走”，总是及时向他们提供各种背景材料，教给他们思考问题的正确理论与方法，指导他们进行社会调查参加社会实践，使他们得益不浅。教员们认为，一切正确思想的确立，最终要靠学员们自己的思考、探索。他们为学员设立了一个“政治理论专修室”，这里有大量书籍和资料，有各种理论动态信息，有100多部教学录像带，设有“质疑板”和“答疑板”，学员有什么疑问都可以提出，教员都作答复，学员也可以提出自己的答案，对有的问题反复诘难。在与学员的交谈中，记者问他们：“你们课余最喜欢去的地方是哪里？”他们异口同声地说：“政治理论专修室。”确实如此，课余时间那里总是挤满了人，学院不得不安排次序限制每次进入的人数。记者深切感受到，在这所学院里，绝大多数学员学政治理论不光是被动地接受灌输，而且是主动热切地追求马克思主义的真理。因此，他们有强烈的社会责任感和历史使命感，但没有不切实际的空想；他们也坚决地反对社会上的腐败现象，但没有怨天尤人的牢骚和愤世嫉俗的“冷漠”；他们拥护改革、开放，但没有生吞活剥西方思潮的空论和对西方社会的向往，资产阶级自由化思潮在这里很难找到市场。
    教学内容跟上时代步伐
    记者同这所学院的政委董克让大校作过多次交谈。他饱经风霜，是一位令人尊敬的老军人。
    “办学校，培养人，政治方向是第一位的。”董政委说，“我们的工作做得还很不够，但是，把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位，这一点我们一直是明确的。”他以海上航行作比喻：“技术、业务当然要很精，但是，如果方向错了，技术业务再精也没有用，弄不好还会有相反的后果。政治理论课，马克思主义理论教学，就是提供正确的方向。我们尽可能地支持政治理论课的教学。”
    这所学院的领导对政治理论课的重视不只是表现在口头上、纸面上，而是切切实实的行动，常常是院长、政委亲自为政治理论教师们创造条件。七八年前农村经济改革蓬勃兴起，政治课上却还在讲“三级所有，队为基础”，陈旧的教学内容使学员兴趣索然，都不爱听。而政治课内容的改动又是非常严肃的事，教员们明知脱离实际，却不敢越雷池一步。学院党委鼓励教员们大胆更新教学内容，把党在新时期的新思想反映到教学中去。学院经费有限，但尽力支持政治教员走出校门去作大规模的社会调查。这七八年来，政治教员先后有200多人次到14个省市的几十个县、市去作调查，掌握了社会上改革、开放的各种新信息。教员们了解到的理论学术活动，学院也尽可能让他们参加，及时掌握理论动态。在这个基础上，政治教员们使他们开设的13门课的教学内容有了大幅度更新。教员们提出建立“政治理论专修室”，学院全力支持，把它作为校级实验室的建制加以装备。学院还与大邱庄、天津港、天津经济技术开发区等6个单位联系，建立了6个政治理论课的社会实践基地，聘请这些单位的负责人、专家为兼职教授。这些单位来人，院长、政委总要亲自接待。政治课教员都明白，要是没有学院领导的重视和支持，这所学院的政治理论课是不会有今天这样的成效的。
    “政治理论课本来就应该是很吸引人的，应该是使人很感兴趣的。”董政委说，“如果不吸引人，学员不爱听，就起不到应有的教育作用，说是把正确的政治方向放在首位，实际上就做不到。如果是这样，首先就是我们学院领导的责任。”
    从社会实践中吸取新养料
    50多年前，毛泽东在延安窑洞里写《实践论》时，就指出马克思主义理论的两个特点：阶级性和实践性。50多年后的今天，这个论断仍然闪现着真理的光彩。不少人在理论上之所以产生迷茫和“信仰危机”，走入歧途，重要原因是忘记了这两个特点。对于马克思主义理论教学来说，把握住这两个特点尤为重要。在海军勤务学院采访，可以明显地感到那里政治理论课的教与学是把握住这两个特点的。这也正是他们取得成效的主要原因。把握阶级性，主要体现在他们对资产阶级自由化思潮的坚决排斥和有说服力的批判上。这也有赖于坚持实践性原则。不坚持实践性原则，马克思主义理论的阶级性、战斗性就会成为一句空话。海军勤务学院的领导和政治理论教员非常重视实践性原则，给人留下深刻的印象。
    首先是政治理论教员自己投入到改革开放的社会实践中去重新学习，亲自体察我们党和人民在新的历史时期的伟大实践。全教研室21名教员大都多次外出调查过。他们接触到了几乎所有当今中国社会的重大问题，一些教员还参与了某些问题最前沿的争论与探索。正是这种亲身实践，使这些政治理论教员获得了有关当今中国社会的丰富知识，积累了300多万字的资料，了解到马克思主义在当代中国的新发展，也使他们获得了改革马克思主义理论教学的动力和勇气。他们对教学内容作了7次大更新，增加了“马克思主义在当代的发展”、“改革开放中的理论问题”、“现代西方思想界对马克思主义的挑战”等新课程，还开设了“改革大潮中的青年思维热点与马克思主义的探索”、“改革中的哲学问题”等讲座，使政治理论课增加至13门，而且面目一新。教员的社会实践至今源源不断，使他们的课程永远保持着新的气息。
    尽管政治课内容新、讲授活，学员们很欢迎，但是学员们如果不直接接触社会实际，那末政治理论课仍然是“跛脚”的，不能收到应有的效果。董克让政委说：“我们就担心学员光读书，不接触实际，变成书呆子，钻牛角尖。我们不能培养书呆子，一定要让他们参加社会实践。”政治理论教研室主任李树林讲师向记者介绍：“有一次假期结束，学员们回校后提出了200个有关现实生活的问题。我们分析后发现其中60％涉及的理论和类似的事例，课堂上都曾讲过，但学员碰到具体问题时，不少人仍不能用学过的理论去分析，得出结论。当然，现实生活总比较复杂。这说明组织学员直接参加社会实践非常必要。”于是，他们把学员的社会实践作为政治理论教学的一个重要组成部分，列入教学计划。
    在广阔天地里设课堂
    学员社会实践主要有以下两种方式：
    假期社会调查。每次放假前，政治教研室都向学员布置调查任务、提出要求、安排时间，学员回校后要提交调查报告，作为考核依据。
    建立社会实践基地。学院对附近50多个单位作了考察，根据教学需要选择了6个单位建立稳定的联系，作为实践基地，有天津阀门厂、天津新港、新港造船厂、天津碱厂、天津经济技术开发区、大邱庄。教员根据教学进程和学员们提出的问题，组织学员到基地参观、调查，请基地负责人给学员讲课。几年来到基地去调查、学习过的学员有上万人次，先后进行过67个问题的专题调查。记者采访时，正好遇上一批学员到天津经济技术开发区了解引进外资问题，便与他们一起前去。一些学员对前不久签订的开发区一块土地租让协议不理解，有的问：“这与旧中国的租界有什么不同？”中共天津市经济技术开发区工委办公室主任是海军勤务学院的兼职教授，他从我国对外开放的方针、租让协议的内容、国际上的通例等方面详细介绍了这一租让对我国经济、技术和对外贸易所具有的重大意义，不仅使学员们了解了这一租让与旧中国的租界有根本的不同，还使他们增加了不少有关引进外资的知识，进一步认识对外开放方针的正确性。
    社会实践使学员们亲身体察到党在干什么，人民在干什么，明白了自己应当干什么和怎么干，使他们对国情有了较多的了解，知道了我们党和人民有那么多创举，还有那么多难题要解决，引发他们去思考，促使他们用马克思主义的基本原理去分析问题，得出正确的结论。这样学到的理论是巩固的。学员写的社会实践报告已有3000多份，记者阅读了其中的几份。军港工程专业有位学员调查分析了几个经济技术开发区的产品，以丰富的资料为据，指出开发区产品结构存在缺陷，劳动密集型产品较多，高附加值产品偏少，提出要多发展高技术企业，很有说服力。有四位学员分别对天津港集装箱公司和天津碱厂作了调查，提出在生产成本大幅度上升的情况下如何提高企业效益的几点看法，有理有据，有一定的理论深度和实施价值。不少学员还根据自己社会实践的体会开展“我为家乡改革致富献一计”活动，向家乡地方政府出谋献策，有的被采纳了，甚至收到显效。
    很多地方高等学校到勤务学院来了解政治理论课教学改革经验，他们对该校的政治理论教学实践基地既赞扬、羡慕，又感到不易仿效，因为很难找到愿意承担这种义务的企业、单位。另外，学校经费也不够。这确实是个问题。人们问海军勤务学院：“你们是怎么建立起这种关系的？”他们回答：“一靠这些单位对教育事业的热心；二靠双向支援。我们在知识方面有些优势，帮助他们学习马克思主义理论和管理知识，帮助他们培养干部，向他们提供信息咨询和技术服务。”
    政治课教员：特殊的职业
    政治理论课要使学员自觉主动地去追求马克思主义的真理，并非易事。讲授内容要新，讲授方法要活，要参加社会实践，等等，都是必要的。然而这一切都要由政治课教员来实施。政治课所有的改革，最终都是增加了政治教员的工作负担，这点与其他学科的教师很不一样。院长彭乾升大校说：
  “我们高兴的是我们这支政治课教师队伍很好。我们对他们提出三个要求：一会做社会调查；二要有尽可能好的理论修养；三要会做学员的思想工作。他们都很努力。”
    政治理论课确实与其它学科不同。它是关于人的科学，并且同人们的思想、日常生活息息相关。脱离了人们的日常生活、脱离了人们的思想尤其是思想上的“热点”，政治理论就会成为无本之木、无源之水。政治理论课的这些特殊性，决定了政治理论教师这一职业的特殊性。海军勤务学院的政治教师们很了解自己职业的特殊性，他们知难而进，克尽职守。
    他们把自己的业务延伸到了学员们的日常生活领域，每人固定联系一个班，参加学员每周一次的班务会，与其他政工人员一起做思想政治工作。在这方面他们有理论优势，对于学员们日常生活中的思想问题，如学员经常碰到的婚姻恋爱问题等他们能从较深的层次上去分析、引导，令人信服。他们同学员建立了深厚的感情，学员们非常信任他们，都愿意把心里话、个人生活的秘密告诉他们。学员们说：“我们的政治课教员不是‘上课才见面，下课找不到’，而是时时在我们身边，他们是我们生活中的良师益友。”
    常在学员身边，他们固然可以更多地了解学员，但同时也会使自己的人格、思想、品行操守显露在学员们面前。学员们不光听他们讲台上讲的理论，不光看到他们在讲台上的形象，还看到他们在日常生活中的形象。如果两者之间有很大的反差，那他讲的理论再好，也要在学员心目中失去光彩。这也是政治教师职业的特殊性。因此，政治课教师应当是品格高尚的人，言行一致的人，所谓“为人师表”，对他们来说更为重要。令人信服的是海军勤务学院政治理论教研室的教师们做得很好，无愧于政治课教师的称号。教研室主任李树林说：“我们对自己提出这样的要求：对马克思主义要真信、真懂、真干。这些都是无止境的，我们将不断努力。”这是个很高的要求，他们确实在努力实践，采访中记者了解到不少动人的事例。李昌益教授是教研室最老的教员，已60岁。一次，一位新学员问他：“您给别人讲马克思主义，您自己真信吗？”他诚恳地说：“我教了30多年马列主义，如果自己不信，那不等于骗了自己一辈子吗？”学员们知道，李教授治学严谨，不是个骗自己的人。他妻子在天津市区工作，每周才能相聚一次，但他每星期天晚上都坚持赶回学校参加学员的班务会。学员们很感动，说：“老教员参加我们的班务会，不用开口，往那儿一坐，我们的思想问题就解决了一半。”副教授孙育才父亲去世了，他只在家中待了一晚，第二天一早就赶到学校，接连上了3天课。他并非没有父子之情，他说：“一边是父亲的丧事，一边是80名学员等着我上课，我别无选择。”他身体不好，站久了骨疼难忍，但他上课仍坚持站着讲。学员搬来凳子，请他坐着讲。他说：“站着讲效果好”，不肯坐下。学员们感动得全体起立，说：“您不坐下，我们也站着听！”他这才坐下。
    在学员们的眼里，他们政治课教员的“讲台形象”与生活中的形象是重合的。日常生活，成了学员们学习马克思主义理论的又一个课堂。
    海军勤务学院政治理论教学的改革已持续了七八年。这期间已有4000多名学员毕业，他们到了海上、港湾、基地等海军后勤工作的岗位，很多人带了兵。他们在后勤业务上是内行，同时也很善于做思想政治工作，很受部队赞扬。
    海河在这所学校的身边不舍昼夜地流向大海，这所学校的政治理论课教学也在不断地改革、开拓、前进。（附图片）
