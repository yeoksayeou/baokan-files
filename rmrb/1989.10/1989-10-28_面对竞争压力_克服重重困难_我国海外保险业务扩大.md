Facing Competition Pressure and Overcoming Numerous Difficulties, China's Overseas Insurance Business Expands

    BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's overseas insurance companies, under the China People's Insurance Company, have expanded their business operations in the face of intense competition and an oversupply of insurance capacity in the international market. They have actively increased their service outlets and flexibly expanded their service areas, ensuring business growth. In the past two years, the premium income of these overseas companies has generally reached or exceeded a 10% growth rate, and their social reputation has been steadily improving.

    Since 1987, the global economy has shown signs of slow growth, which has also stimulated demand for insurance in various countries. China's overseas insurance companies have seized this opportunity to continuously open up new business sources. The Hong Kong branch of the China Pacific Insurance Company has introduced new products such as "Carrier Liability Insurance," "Comprehensive Machinery Trial Insurance," "All-Risk Property Insurance," and "Home Insurance." The Hong Kong branch of the China Life Insurance Company has launched new products such as "Family Safety Insurance," "Lifetime Savings and Dividends," "Child Insurance," "Lifetime Preferred Dividends," "Regular Savings Insurance," and "Rehabilitation Savings Plan." The Singapore branch of the Taiping Insurance Company has introduced products such as "Travel Accident Insurance" and "Home Comprehensive Insurance." Some companies have also improved the underwriting conditions of existing businesses or designed new insurance products based on customer requirements. Various overseas insurance companies have also established additional institutions and service outlets, playing a good role in linking the China People's Insurance Company, overseas insurance peers, and insurance customers.

　　面对竞争压力　克服重重困难
　　我国海外保险业务扩大
    本报北京10月27日讯　记者施明慎报道：中国人民保险公司在海外的各家保险公司，在国际保险市场承保能力过剩、竞争异常激烈的情况下，积极扩大经营网点，灵活开拓服务领域，保证了业务的发展。这两年，各海外公司的保费收入都基本达到或超过了10％的增长速度，社会声誉日益提高。
    自1987年以来，国际上出现经济低速增长的势头，同时也刺激了各国对保险的需求。我国各海外保险公司抓住机会，不断开辟新的业务来源。香港民安保险公司推出了“承运责任险”“安机试机综合险”、“财产一切险”“民安家居”等项业务；中国人寿香港分公司开办了“家庭平安保险”、“终生储蓄分红”、“幼童保险”、“终身优惠分红”，“零存整付储蓄保险”，“康复储蓄保险计划”等新品种；太平保险公司新加坡分公司开办了“旅行意外险”、“住家综合险”等等。一些公司还根据客户的要求，改善了现有业务的承保条件，或者设计了新的险种。各海外保险公司还增设了一些机构和服务网点，在中国人民保险公司和海外保险同业以及保险客户之间发挥了较好的联络作用。
