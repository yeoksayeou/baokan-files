Egyptian President Mubarak and Palestinian President Arafat held their second round of talks today, discussing the current Middle East peace process.

According to the Middle East News Agency, quoting a senior Egyptian official, the two sides conducted in-depth discussions on various aspects of the Palestinian issue, including U.S. Secretary of State Baker's five-point peace plan.

The report said that today's talks are part of the ongoing consultations between Mubarak and Arafat on the Middle East peace process. Egypt and the PLO have reached consensus on many issues. The Palestinian side is determined to push forward the peace process, despite Israel's rejection of Palestinian-Israeli dialogue and continued suppression of Palestinians in the occupied territories.

Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Magid said today that Egypt is in broad contact with relevant parties to strengthen efforts for Middle East peace. He has exchanged views with Baker over the phone. Baker is considering withdrawing his five-point plan to break the current stalemate in the Middle East peace process.

Arafat, leading the Palestinian delegation, arrived here yesterday. He held the first round of talks with Mubarak yesterday morning. He left Cairo later today.
