In 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, the Jino people living in the primitive forests of Jino Mountain (formerly known as Youle Mountain) within the boundaries of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province were still in the late stages of primitive society, living in isolation from the world, practicing slash-and-burn agriculture, and using wooden notches to record events.

Thirty years later, in 1979, when the State Council officially recognized the Jino people as the 55th ethnic minority in China, Jino Mountain was still a poor township that relied on grain subsidies, financial aid, and loans for production. The per capita income was only 27.2 yuan.

Ten years of reform brought significant changes to Jino Mountain. Today, visitors are greeted by modern buildings such as the Science and Technology Training Center, middle schools, primary schools, shops, and the township government, as well as newly constructed rows of red-brick houses with green tiles and tall television antennas. Township officials told me that last year, the total income of the township reached 6.33 million yuan, an increase of 5.5 times compared to 1978. The per capita net income of farmers reached 624 yuan, an increase of 6.2 times compared to ten years ago. Out of the 44 villages, 91% have roads. Most places have electricity and running water. Items like radios, televisions, VCRs, cameras, and motorcycles have become common in Jino households.

Jino Mountain is a true "treasure mountain." The region has a tropical climate, fertile soil, and gentle slopes, making it ideal for growing tropical and subtropical crops such as tea, fruits, and rubber. The reason the Jino people lived in poverty despite their rich environment was their long-standing practice of cutting trees, burning fields, and growing dry rice, which led to a vicious cycle of increasing poverty and deforestation. Starting in 1980, with the help of the prefecture and county, Jino Mountain shifted from a single focus on grain production to a strategy of "forestry as the mainstay, diversified operations, and comprehensive development." The prefecture and county sent technical personnel to the mountain, using the quick-yielding and low-investment sandalwood as a breakthrough. In the first year, planting sandalwood alone increased farmers' per capita income by over 200 yuan. With a stable production base, the people seized the opportunity to develop rubber, tea, and fruit crops. Now, the total area of various economic crops has reached nearly 40,000 mu, surpassing the area of grain cultivation. The Jino people's industrial structure has undergone a fundamental change.

Having escaped poverty and emerged from their primitive state, the Jino people understand that only through education can a nation advance to the ranks of the advanced. Consequently, the enthusiasm for collective funding of education has reached unprecedented heights. Since 1984, the people have collectively raised 160,000 yuan and contributed over 10,000 labor days to rebuild 22 primary schools from thatched huts into brick-and-wood or mixed-structure new school buildings. Today, every Jino village has a primary school, every village has a higher primary school, and the township has a middle school, achieving universal primary education. Currently, the township has over 830 junior high school graduates, 190 senior high school and normal school graduates, and 34 college graduates working in the prefecture, county, and township.

Science and technology have given the Jino people wings. The more than 10,000 Jino people are striving towards a progressive and prosperous future.

　　基诺族，跨世纪的变化
　　杨佑钧（白族）
    1949年，当中华人民共和国诞生的时候，聚居在云南省西双版纳傣族自治州境内基诺山（旧称攸乐山）原始森林中的基偌人，还生活在原始社会末期的公社制之中，过着与世隔绝，刀耕火种，刻木记事的生活。
    过了30年，也就是1979年，当国务院正式批准基诺族为我国第55个少数民族的时候，基诺山还是一个吃粮靠返销，花钱靠救济，生产靠贷款的贫困乡，人均收入仅27元2角。
    十年改革，使基诺山改变了面貌。如今人们来到这里，首先映入眼帘的是科技培训中心、中学、小学、商店、乡政府等一幢幢新式建筑和农民新建的一排排红砖青瓦的新式瓦房以及房顶那高耸入云的电视接收天线。乡上的干部告诉我，去年，全乡总收入达到633万多元，比1978年增加了5.5倍，农民人均纯收入达到624元，比10年前增加了6.2倍。全乡44个寨子，通公路的占91％。多半地方通了电和自来水。收录机，电视机，录相机、照相机、摩托车等都进入了基诺族的普通人家。
    基诺山是一座名副其实的“宝山”，这里属南亚热带气候，加之土壤肥沃，山势较缓，很适宜茶叶、水果、橡胶等热带、亚热带作物生长。基诺族过去之所以住在富山上过穷日子，根子就是世代沿袭着砍树、烧荒、种旱谷的生产习惯，陷入了越穷越砍（树），越砍（树）越穷的恶性循环圈中。从1980年开始，在州、县的帮助下，基诺山变以粮为纲、单一经营为“以林为主，因地制宜，多种经营，综合发展”。州、县派出科技人员上山，以投资少、见效快的砂仁为突破口，当年仅种植砂仁一项，农民人均收入就增加200多元。有了一定的生产垫本之后，群众又不失时机地大力发展橡胶、茶叶、水果等经济作物。现全乡各种经济作物面积已近4万亩，超过粮食播种面积。基诺族的产业结构发生了根本变化。
    摆脱了贫困，走出了蛮荒的基诺族深知，只有发展教育，一个民族才能跻身于先进民族之列，因而群众集资办学的积极性空前高涨。1984年以来，群众共集资16万元，投工1万多个，把22所小学的茅草校舍改建成砖木结构和混合结构的新校舍。现在的基诺山寨有初小，村有高小，乡有中学，全乡已普及了小学教育。全乡现有初中毕业生830多人，高中、中师毕业生190多人，还有34名大学生在州、县、乡工作。
    科学技术为基诺族插上了翅膀。一万多人口的基诺人正向着进步、繁荣的明天奋进。
