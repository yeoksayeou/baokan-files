The Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera School is a cradle for cultivating talents in Sichuan Opera. Over the past 30 years since its establishment, its graduates have spread across Sichuan and the neighboring provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou, with many becoming artistic backbone members. In various art competitions within and outside the province, the school has repeatedly achieved outstanding results. For example, in the 1988 Sichuan Provincial Mid-Young Sichuan Opera Actor Television Selection Contest, 15 "Best Actor" awards were set, and the school won 10 of them. Gu Xiaqin and Shen Tiehua, who won the Sixth "Plum Blossom Award," and Deng Jie, who won the three major awards in the television industry, all graduated from Sichuan School. Recently, the adult vocational students of the school went to Beijing to participate in the Second China Art Festival, performing two short plays and one full-length play, "Green Waves Red Lotus," once again showcasing the school's outstanding achievements in cultivating new talents.

These students are all in their early 20s. Before entering the school, they were the best in various professional and county troupes, with good conditions. After two years of further study, they have already shown their potential. Their characteristics are that the roles are well-distributed, the skills are solid, the unique techniques are abundant, and the performances are excellent, attracting the attention of their peers in the opera world and receiving praise from the audience.

In the past, people often thought that Sichuan Opera excels in "three small roles" (small sheng, small dan, small clown), but this is a misunderstanding. Sichuan Opera has many robes and martial arts plays, but for a long time, there has been a lack of good old sheng, painted faces, and martial arts sheng, so they are rarely performed, leading to the above impression. This time, we are happy to see the heavy plays of "Beheading the Nephew," "Beheading the Scripture Hall," and "Killing the Dog," performed by Li Qiaosong as Bao Zheng, Hu Yu Bin as Wu Han, and Li Yandong as Cao Zhuang. All of them have natural good voices, high, wide, and bright, with abundant breath, skilled singing techniques, rich rhyme, and full of passion. The clown Zhao Anping, in the play "Stopping the Horse," performs as Jiao Guangpu, with his light, handsome, fast, and crisp somersault skills, clean and crisp chair skills, and elegant and standard body posture skills, making a common play extraordinary. These roles, which are not easy to produce talents, now have rare good seeds, which is particularly gratifying. Together with Peng Xinqi, Zhang Jianping, and Xiao Demei in the sheng role, and Li Yali, Lei Min, and Yang Nanhu in the dan role, they can truly be described as a gathering of talents and a stage full of new stars, full of youthful vitality and vigor.

These students have received rigorous training, with solid basic skills. Every move and every tune are standard and rigorous. They are proficient in handling high-difficulty movements and special techniques, making them seem effortless and relaxed. In the play "Killing the Dog," the actress playing Jia Shi, Tian Mansha, starts with a beautiful double sleeve throw action, combined with her sneaky look at Cao Zhuang, immediately capturing the attention of the entire audience, clearly conveying Jia Shi's specific psychology of abusing her mother-in-law while fearing her husband. As the husband's questioning and Jia Shi's defense escalate the conflict, Tian Mansha uses the "back shell double rear sleeve throw," 360-degree body rotation, and large-amplitude hair tossing, among other program combinations, to depict Jia Shi's indignant and near-hysterical state to the fullest. When Cao Zhuang, enraged, raises the knife to threaten, Tian Mansha's eyes widen, and she quickly retreats with ballet-like toe steps, accurately revealing the character's frightened and panicked psychology. In the chase, Tian Mansha's four-foot-five-inch-long water sleeves, either thrown up and shot horizontally or rotated left and right, combined with fast actions such as the shuttle kneeling, depict the character's panic, evasion, and desperate situation, both exaggerated and realistic. In the play "Rolling Lantern," the clown Lan Jiaru, playing the cowardly son of a wealthy family, Pi Jin, to avoid his wife's lashing, is forced to roll on the ground with an oil lamp on his head, performing cross steps, snake steps, and even crawling under and over three benches, doing various dangerous actions, while the oil lamp on his head remains stable. This kind of real skill cannot be achieved by trickery. In the play "Capturing Sanlang Alive," Lan Jiaru again uses techniques such as kicking pleats, "lifting people," "lifting boots," and changing faces to depict Zhang Wenfeng, a lecherous and cowardly man, being captured by the ghost of Yan Xiejiu, showing his dispirited and dying state of despair and horror, portraying ugliness within beauty.

The senior artist Wei Chuantong wrote an inscription for this performance: "Revitalizing Sichuan Opera, Education is the Foundation," which hits the nail on the head. We believe that as long as we cultivate and produce a group of excellent and outstanding talents, there is great hope for revitalizing opera.

　　看四川省川剧学校晋京演出
　　陈培仲
    四川省川剧学校是培养川剧艺术人才的摇篮。建校30多年来，其毕业生遍布全川及云、贵地区的专业剧团，不少人已成为艺术骨干。在省内外的艺术竞赛中，该校多次取得优异成绩。如1988年四川省中青年川剧演员电视大选赛设“最佳演员奖”15名，该校即夺得10名。荣获第六届“梅花奖”的古小琴、沈铁梅，荣获电视界三大奖的邓婕，均从川校毕业。最近该校成人中专班的学员，晋京参加第二届中国艺术节，演出了两台折子戏和一台大戏
  《碧波红莲》，再次展示了该校在培养新人上的优异成绩。
    这批学员均20出头，进校前是各专、县剧团的尖子，有着较好的条件，经过两年的深造，已经崭露头角。其特点是行当整齐、功夫扎实、绝技迭出、精采纷呈，受到了戏曲同行的瞩目和观众的好评。
    过去，人们常常认为川剧以“三小戏”（小生、小旦、小丑）见长，其实，这是一种误解。川剧中有不少袍带戏、武功戏，只是长期以来，缺少好的老生、花脸、武生，因而很少演出，致使人们产生上述印象。这次我们高兴地看到了《铡侄》、《斩经堂》、《杀狗》等净行、正生的重头戏，扮演包拯的李乔松、扮演吴汉的胡瑜斌、扮演曹庄的李艳冬，均有天赋的好嗓子，高宽明亮、运气充沛，演唱技巧娴熟，富于韵味，且有激情。武丑赵安平在《拦马》中扮演焦光普，以其轻、帅、快、脆的筋斗功，干净利落的椅子功，潇洒规范的身架功，将一出常见的剧目演得不同凡响。这些不易出人才的行当，如今有难得的好苗子，令人格外欣慰。加上小生行中的彭欣綦、张建平、肖德美，旦行中的李亚莉、雷敏、杨楠桦等人，真可谓人材济济，新秀满台，洋溢着青春的活力和朝气。
    这批学员受过严格的训练，基本功扎实，一招一式、一腔一调规范严谨，对高难动作和特技的掌握运用，得心应手，轻松自如。在《杀狗》中扮演焦氏的田蔓莎，一出场那漂亮的前后双抛袖动作，加上那窥视曹庄的眼光，一下子就拢住了全场观众的神，将焦氏虐待婆母而又惧怕丈夫的特定心理，清晰地传递给了观众。随着丈夫的责问、焦氏的辩白，矛盾逐步激化，田蔓莎以
  “背壳双后抛袖”，转体360度僵尸、大幅度甩发等程式组合，将焦氏愤懑不平而近于撒泼的心态神情，刻画得淋漓尽至。待怒火中烧的曹庄举刀威慑时，只见田蔓莎双眼发直以芭蕾舞的脚尖步急速后退，十分准确地揭示了人物惊惧惶恐的心理。在两人追赶之中，田蔓莎那双四尺五寸长的水袖，或上抛横射，或左右飞旋，配以梭跪等快速动作，将人物惊惶失措、左躲右藏、无路可逃的心情和处境，描摹得维妙维肖，既夸张，又真实。在《滚灯》中，以丑行应工的蓝家富扮演惧内的纨绔子弟皮金，为了躲过老婆的鞭笞，被迫头顶一盏油灯，在地上翻滚，表演交叉步、蛇行步，还能倒钻、顺钻三条板凳，做各种惊险动作，而头上的油灯始终稳稳当当。这种真功夫，非取巧所能练就。在《活捉三郎》中，蓝家富又以踢褶子、“提?人”、“提靴子”、变脸等特技，将张文远这个既贪花又怕死的好色之徒被阎惜姣鬼魂活捉时那种丧魂落魄、气尽而亡的丑态，刻画得穷形尽相，丑中见美。
    文艺界前辈魏传统将军为这次演出题辞曰：“振兴川剧，教育为本”，这说到了关键。我们相信，只要培养、造就出一批优秀的、杰出的人才，振兴戏曲就大有希望。
