Today, all newspapers in the German Democratic Republic published on the front page and in the top headlines the important statement issued by the Central Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany regarding the current situation in the GDR. The statement emphasizes that the GDR will persist on the socialist path, calls on the people of the entire nation to work together to solve the current problems facing the GDR, and condemns West Germany's blatant interference in the internal affairs of the GDR.

The statement says that the socialist German Democratic Republic is the cause of all the people, a worker-peasant government established through the joint efforts of the people, and therefore it should be jointly defended with determination.

The statement condemns West Germany for tearing up relevant agreements, ignoring international law, interfering in the internal affairs of the GDR, inciting and misleading propaganda, inducing GDR citizens to leave, and attempting to eliminate socialism on GDR soil to change the peaceful order in Europe. The statement emphasizes that their schemes will never succeed.

The statement points out that the broad masses of the people in the GDR, with their politically sensible actions and conscious sense of responsibility towards the state and the people, have drawn a clear line with those who are launching a counter-revolutionary attack on the people. The issue of the GDR continuing to develop socialism must be resolved by the GDR party and people themselves through pragmatic dialogue and political mutual trust.

The statement expresses the intention to discuss major issues in society with the people, listen to their opinions and suggestions, and solve these problems.

The statement says that the next plenary session of the Party Central Committee will, based on the strategic thinking of continuity and innovation, propose suggestions to the entire Party and the people of the nation. All opinions and suggestions for building an attractive socialism in the GDR are important and will be considered.

The statement calls for the broad use of all necessary forms of socialist democracy in the GDR, but opposes those so-called "suggestions" and demonstrations that deliberately deceive the people and attempt to change the constitutional basis.

The statement finally points out that the German Democratic Republic is a state created by the citizens of the GDR, both men and women, united in the Democratic Alliance, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, for their own interests. The existence of socialism on German soil is not optional. The people of the German Democratic Republic will forever choose socialism.

    本报柏林10月12日电　记者许宏治报道：今天民主德国各报都在头版头条位置刊登了德国统一社会党中央政治局就当前民德形势发表的重要声明。声明强调民德将坚持社会主义道路，号召全国人民齐心协力解决民德当前遇到的问题，并谴责西德对民德内政的粗暴干涉。
    声明说，社会主义的民主德国是全体人民的事业，是人民共同努力建立起来的工农政权，因此应当共同努力坚决加以捍卫。
    声明谴责西德撕毁有关协议，无视国际法，干涉民德内政，进行煽动和蛊惑宣传，诱使民德公民出走，妄图在民德国土上消灭社会主义以改变欧洲的和平秩序。声明强调，他们的图谋是决不可能得逞的。
    声明指出，民德广大人民群众以具有政治理智的行动、对国家和人民自觉的责任心，同那些对人民进行反革命进攻的人划清了界限。民德继续发展社会主义的问题要靠民德党和人民自己通过求实的对话并以政治上的充分相互信任来解决。
    声明表示要对社会上各种重大问题同人民群众进行讨论，听取意见和建议，以使这些问题得到解决。
    声明说，党中央下一次全会将根据连续和革新相结合的战略思想向全党和全国人民提出建议。一切为在民德建设有吸引力的社会主义而提出的意见和建议都是重要的，并将受到考虑。
    声明号召广泛利用民德拥有的社会主义民主的一切必要形式，但反对那种蓄意欺骗人民、企图改变宪法规定的基础的所谓“建议”和示威游行。
    声明最后指出，民主德国是在德国统一社会党的领导下，联合在民主联盟里的民德男女公民为了他们的利益而创造出来的国家。社会主义在德国土地上的存在不是可有可无的。民主德国人民永远选择社会主义。
