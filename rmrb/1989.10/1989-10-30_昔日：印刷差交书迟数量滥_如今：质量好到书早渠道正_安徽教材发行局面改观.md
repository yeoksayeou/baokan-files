	The past: Poor printing, late delivery, and excessive quantities
	The present: Good quality, timely delivery, and proper channels
	The situation of textbook distribution in Anhui has improved

	Our reporter Zhang Zhen Guo reports from Hefei on October 29: The passive situation of printing and distributing textbooks for primary and secondary schools in Anhui has been reversed. The previous issues of "poor printing, late delivery, and excessive quantities" are now being replaced by "good quality, timely delivery, and proper channels."

	This year, on March 11 and 26, our newspaper consecutively exposed the problems with Anhui's primary and secondary school textbooks. The Anhui Provincial Government considered this a matter of great injustice to the children and held multiple meetings to study and resolve the issue. They also issued a document titled "Ensuring the Supply of Primary and Secondary School Textbooks," which made regulations in six areas: paper and electricity usage, quality assurance, funding, transportation, and the prohibition of forced sales of other books and materials.

	The Provincial Planning Commission, Education Commission, and Publishing House worked closely together, treating this matter of cultivating the next generation as a comprehensive project. As a result, the rate of textbooks delivered before the start of the autumn semester reached 99.14%.

　　昔日：印刷差交书迟数量滥
　　如今：质量好到书早渠道正
　　安徽教材发行局面改观
    本报合肥10月29日电　记者张振国报道：安徽各地中小学课本印刷发行的被动局面已扭转，原来的“印刷差、交书迟、数量滥”，已开始被“质量好、到书早、渠道正”所替代。
    今年3月11日和26日，本报连续披露了安徽中小学教材出现的问题。安徽省府认为这是一件非常对不起孩子的事，多次开会研究解决此事，并发了“做好中小学课本供应工作”的文件，从用纸用电、保质保量、资金供给、交通运输，以及不准硬性搭售其它书籍资料6个方面作出规定。
    省计委、教委、出版总社等单位紧密协作，把这件事关培养下一代的大事当作一个系统工程来抓。结果，今秋课前到书率达到99.14％。
