This year's five Nobel Prizes have been announced. Our correspondent Gu Yaoming reports from Stockholm:

The Swedish Academy announced today at noon that the 1989 Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to the Spanish writer Camilo José Cela.

The 73-year-old Cela is skilled in writing novels, travelogues, and essays. He is a member of the Spanish Academy of Letters. The Swedish Academy described him in its statement as "an influential figure in the literary renaissance following the Spanish Civil War."

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on October 11 that the 1989 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to Professor Trygve Haavelmo of Norway.

It is reported that the 78-year-old professor at the University of Oslo has made outstanding contributions to the fundamental theory of economics. His research results show that mathematical statistical methods can be used to estimate, verify economic theories, and predict the practical situations of these theories.

The Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute announced on October 9 that the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Americans Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus, in recognition of their contributions to the discovery of the causes of cancer cell formation.

Bishop and Varmus are both professors at the University of California School of Medicine. They discovered that if the oncogenes in the genes that control cell growth encounter obstacles, a normal cell can transform into a cancer cell, leading to the formation of cancer.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on October 12 that the 1989 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to American professors Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech.

It is reported that the 50-year-old professor at Yale University, Sidney Altman, and the 42-year-old professor at the University of Colorado, Thomas Cech, have made outstanding contributions to the discovery of the catalytic properties of ribonucleic acid.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on October 12 that this year's Nobel Prize in Physics will be shared by two American professors and one West German professor, in recognition of their contributions to the development of precise atomic measurement methods.

The Academy awarded half of the prize to Professor Norman Ramsey of Harvard University, in recognition of his invention of the separated oscillatory field method and its application to hydrogen masers and other atomic instruments.

The other half of the prize was awarded to Professor Hans Dehmelt of the University of Washington and Professor Wolfgang Paul of the University of Bonn, in recognition of their proposal and development of ion trapping technology, which makes it possible to study individual electrons or ions with high precision. They also developed the hydrogen maser, forming the currently most stable source of electromagnetic radiation.

    据介绍，今年78岁的奥斯陆大学教授哈韦尔莫在经济学基础理论研究方面有杰出贡献。他的研究成果表明数学统计方法可以被用来估价、验证经济理论，及预测这些理论的实践情况。
    瑞典卡罗林医学院诺贝尔奖评选委员会10月9日宣布，将1989年诺贝尔生理和医学奖授予美国的迈克尔·毕晓普和哈罗德·瓦尔姆斯，以表彰他们在发现癌细胞形成的起因方面作出的贡献。
    毕晓普和瓦尔姆斯都是美国加利福尼亚大学医学院的教授。他们发现控制细胞生长的基因中的致癌基因如遇到了障碍可以使一个正常细胞转化成癌细胞，以致形成癌症。
    瑞典皇家科学院10月12日宣布美国教授悉尼·奥尔特曼和托马斯·切赫获得1989年度诺贝尔化学奖。
    据介绍，今年50岁的耶鲁大学的教授悉尼·奥尔特曼和42岁的科罗拉多大学教授托马斯·切赫在发现核糖核酸的催化特性方面作出了杰出贡献。
    瑞典皇家科学院10月12日宣布今年度诺贝尔物理奖由两名美国教授和一名联邦德国教授分享，以表彰他们在发展原子精密测定方法方面的贡献。
    该科学院将这个奖的一半授予美国哈佛大学教授诺曼·拉姆齐，以表彰他发明分离振荡场法及其运用于氢微波激射器和其它原子仪表方面的贡献。
    该奖的另一半授予美国华盛顿大学教授汉斯·德默尔特和联邦德国波恩大学教授沃尔夫冈·保罗，以表彰他们提出和发展离子收集技术，从而有可能非常精确地研究单个电子或单个离子。他们还发展了氢微波激射器，形成了目前最稳定的电磁波辐射来源。
