Watching Svetlana Boginskaya compete is a rare treat of beauty. This Soviet girl, with her exquisite skills and charming allure, conquered judges from around the world and over ten thousand spectators in West Germany, winning the all-around title at the World Gymnastics Championships and becoming another "Queen of Gymnastics."

Boginskaya has a solid foundation and a mature understanding of gymnastics. On the vault, she performs a tsukahara with a backflip and a straight-body layout somersault with 360-degree twist. Her long legs are tightly together, her toes pointed, and her body soars high, fully extended. The judges had no hesitation in giving her a perfect 10. She excels in the floor exercise. Accompanied by the melody of the opera "Carmen," she dances gracefully, like a ballerina, like an acrobat, like a child at play, lively yet dignified, blending childlike innocence with the charm of a young girl. In the Soviet Union, people call her the ballet star of the gymnastics stage, and she truly lives up to her name.

Boginskaya was born on February 9, 1973, in Minsk to a family of construction workers. Her mother is a kindergarten teacher. At the age of six, she first practiced figure skating, and a year later, she switched to gymnastics. In her spare time, she enjoys playing with dolls. At the press conference, she showed her shy nature as a young girl, speaking softly and briefly. She said that she originally planned to retire after this competition. Now she has decided to continue. When asked about the secret to her success, she quoted a Russian proverb: "What you do badly will eventually turn out well."

　　体操台上的芭蕾明星
　　——世界冠军博金斯卡娅速写
    观看斯维特兰娜·博金斯卡娅比赛，是难得的美的享受。这位苏联少女以精湛的技艺和迷人的魅力，征服了来自世界各国资深的裁判和一万多名西德观众，摘取了世界体操锦标赛个人全能桂冠，成为又一个“体操女王”。
    博金斯卡娅有扎实的基本功和成熟的体操意识。她在跳马上做踺子后手翻直体后空翻转体360度，修长的双腿并得拢，脚尖绷得直，身体飞起很高，完全展开。几个裁判几乎没有犹豫，一致给了她10分。自由体操她最拿手。伴随着歌剧“卡门”的旋律，她翩翩飞舞，像芭蕾，像杂技，像游戏，活泼而庄重，儿童的天真和少女的风韵融于一体。在苏联，人们称她是体操舞台上的芭蕾明星，果然名不虚传。
    博金斯卡娅1973年2月9日出生于明斯克一个建筑工人之家，母亲是幼儿园教师。她6岁时先练滑冰，一年以后改学体操。业余时间喜欢玩洋娃娃自娱。在记者招待会上，她又显出小姑娘羞怯的本性，回答问题时声音很小，短短几句。她说，本来她想在参加过这届大赛后就退出比赛。现在决定再干下去。谈到成功的秘诀，她引用了一句俄罗斯谚语：“你干不好的事，终归会朝好的方向转化。”
