Lebanon's parliamentary session faces risk of collapse

Oron demands Lebanese Christian deputies suspend attendance

Lebanese Christians criticize "National Reconciliation Draft"

BEIRUT, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) — Due to serious disagreements over key issues such as the withdrawal of Syrian troops and political reforms, Lebanese Christian military government leader Oron today demanded that Christian deputies suspend their attendance at the Lebanese parliamentary session held in Taif, Saudi Arabia, and return to Beirut to discuss strategies.

The Lebanese Central News Agency quoted General Oron as saying that there is no room for negotiation on the issue of sovereignty. He emphasized that any political reform is useless under the condition of Lebanon being occupied.

The Lebanese parliamentary session opened on Sept. 30. According to a peace plan proposed by the Arab League's three-party committee for mediating the Lebanese crisis, 33 Christian deputies and 30 Muslim deputies from Lebanon participated in this session.

During the session, Christian deputies demanded that Syrian troops supporting Lebanese Muslim militias withdraw completely within six months. However, this demand was firmly opposed by Muslim deputies, causing the negotiations to reach a stalemate.

In light of this situation, after meeting with General Oron, the acting military government's foreign affairs secretary Farouk Abi Rama stated that if both sides still cannot reach a consensus, the Christian deputies will withdraw from the session and return to the country within 24 hours.

Meanwhile, it was reported that as the Lebanese parliamentary session faced the risk of collapse, the governments of Syria and Saudi Arabia expressed their willingness to mediate between the representatives of both sides to push the negotiations forward.

Recently, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal had a meeting with Syrian President Assad regarding the stalemate in the Lebanese parliamentary session. Faisal is also scheduled to hold talks with Lebanese Christian deputies later today. According to Syrian diplomatic sources, Syria supports the national reconciliation proposal put forward by the Arab three-party committee to resolve the Lebanese crisis and is prepared to help the representatives of both sides of the Lebanese parliament reach an agreement.

BEIRUT, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) — Lebanese National Liberal Party Chairman Danny Shamoun today criticized the "National Reconciliation Draft" proposed by the Arab three-party committee, stating that "Lebanon's sovereignty is above all."

He made the above remarks before the Taif conference was about to finalize the draft.

Danny Shamoun expressed dissatisfaction with the section of the draft regarding the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

The document stipulates that Syrian troops will help Lebanon's legal military establish national authority within a maximum of two years, elect a president, form a national unity government, and confirm political reforms through constitutional means.

The document also requires the Syrian government to redeploy troops in eastern Lebanon after the deadline.

Danny Shamoun had repeatedly made strong statements before and after the Taif conference, demanding the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.

In 1976, authorized by the Arab League, Syria deployed 35,000 soldiers to Lebanon. At the Taif conference attended by Christian and Muslim deputies, Muslim deputies demanded political reforms within the country, while Christian deputies insisted on the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon before implementing reforms.

　　黎巴嫩议会会议面临破裂危险
　　奥恩要求黎基督教派议员中止与会
　　黎基督教派批评“民族谅解文件草案”
    新华社贝鲁特10月19日电  由于在叙利亚撤军和政治改革等关键问题上产生了严重的分歧，黎巴嫩基督教派军政府首脑奥恩今天要求基督教派议员中止在沙特阿拉伯塔伊夫举行的黎巴嫩议会会议，返回贝鲁特商量对策。
    黎巴嫩中央通讯社援引奥恩将军的话说，在主权问题上是不允许讨价还价的。他强调，在黎巴嫩被占领的情况下，任何政治改革都是无用的。
    黎巴嫩议会会议于9月30日开幕，按照阿拉伯联盟调解黎巴嫩危机三方委员会的一项和平方案，黎巴嫩基督教派的33名议员和穆斯林方面的30名议员参加了这次会议。
    会上，基督教派议员要求支持黎巴嫩穆斯林民兵的叙利亚军队在6个月内全部撤军，但是这一要求遭到穆斯林议员的坚决反对，致使谈判陷入僵局。
    鉴于这种情况，黎巴嫩临时军政府外交部秘书长法鲁克·阿比拉马在同奥恩将军会晤之后表示，如果双方仍然不能取得一致意见，那么基督教议员将在24小时内撤出会议回国。
    另据报道，正当黎巴嫩议会会议面临破裂之际，叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯两国政府表示愿意为会议双方代表做斡旋工作，促使谈判进行下去。
    日前，沙特外交大臣费萨尔已就黎巴嫩议会会议出现的僵局同叙利亚总统阿萨德举行了会晤，费萨尔还将于今天晚些时候与黎巴嫩基督教议员举行会谈。据叙利亚外交人士说，叙利亚赞成阿拉伯三方委员会为解决黎巴嫩危机而提出的民族和解建议，同时准备帮助黎巴嫩议会双方代表达成协议。
    新华社贝鲁特10月18日电  黎巴嫩自由国民党主席丹尼·夏蒙今天批评阿拉伯三方委员会提出的“民族谅解文件草案”，说“黎巴嫩的主权高于一切”。
    他是在塔伊夫会议将就这一文件最后定稿之前说上述话的。
    丹尼·夏蒙对草案有关叙利亚从黎巴嫩撤军事宜的章节表示不满。
    文件规定，叙利亚军队将帮助黎巴嫩的合法军队在最多2年内建立起国家权威，选举总统、组成民族团结政府并确认以宪法手段进行政治改革。
    文件还要求在限期满后，叙利亚政府在黎巴嫩东部重新布置军队。
    丹尼·夏蒙在塔伊夫会议召开前后曾多次发表强烈声明，要求叙利亚军队撤出黎巴嫩。
    1976年由阿盟授权，叙利亚向黎巴嫩派驻了35000名士兵。在由基督教和穆斯林议员参加的塔伊夫会议上，穆斯林议员要求在国内进行政治改革，但基督教议员则坚持在实行改革以前叙利亚军队先撤出黎巴嫩。
