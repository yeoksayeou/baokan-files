Facing the Test of "Convenience"

Yin Yichao  Sun Linjing

In the face of the severe challenge posed by some unscrupulous merchants attempting to use various means to buy up fertilizers, oils, and medicines to make illicit profits, the staff of the Laishui City Agricultural Materials Company in Shandong Province have set up a model of action, building a line of defense to resist the infiltration of unhealthy trends and the temptation of money.

Laishui City has 1.4 million mu of arable land, and the standard fertilizers and agricultural medicines and films allocated by the state plan are far from meeting the needs. Therefore, some unscrupulous merchants regard the materials company as their "source of wealth," trying every means to open up a "path to wealth." In April this year, a person claiming to be a purchasing agent from another province approached Sun Xianyi, the party branch secretary and manager of the Laishui City Materials Company, offering to buy a portion of urea at a price 200 yuan higher than the original price per ton. He then took out two blankets, two bottles of Maotai wine, and two packs of Yuxian cigarettes from his briefcase, saying it was a "small token," and urged Sun, "You are the head of the company; this matter only needs your nod and a word, and it will be done. Afterwards, you will definitely not be shortchanged." Sun glared at the man: "My authority is given by the Party and the people. Anything that damages the Party's prestige and harms the farmers, no matter how much you offer, I won't do it!" The man, realizing he had met his match, could only leave in disgust. Later, someone else came to hint that if they sold them chemicals, they would give the company leaders a "rebate" and solve some "welfare" issues for the employees.

In the face of the temptation of money and material goods, the leaders of the Laishui City Materials Company remained sober-minded. They launched a campaign throughout the company focusing on opposing the idea of "everything for money," building a dam against corruption, and effectively enhancing the ability of the staff to resist the infiltration of unhealthy trends. To meet the urgent needs of local fruit farmers, in May this year, the company purchased 3 tons of "Duraphos" pesticide from the Qingdao Pesticide Factory at a price of 24,700 yuan per ton. As soon as it left the factory gate, several "drug peddlers" immediately offered to buy it at a price of 45,000 yuan per ton. However, the purchasing agent of this company did not succumb, and not a single ounce was sold.

Since this year, the operating management fee per 100 yuan of fertilizer sales has increased from 1.8 yuan three years ago to 3.52 yuan, and in the case of unchanged state fertilizer prices, the enterprise incurs a loss of 28.68 yuan for every ton of fertilizer sold. Some merchants proactively proposed that if the fertilizers were transferred to them, the enterprise's losses would be fully borne by them. To these "well-meaning" people, the company politely declined: "The burden of the company must not be shifted to the farmers. The benefits given to the farmers by the Party and the state, no one is allowed to take away." Whether it is allocated by the state or purchased externally, they all deliver it to the farmers at the regulated price.

To prevent farmers from being cheated, this company has also strengthened the management of non-plan agricultural production materials procurement, clearly stipulating that the production enterprises of agricultural production materials must be designated by the state, the product quality must meet the national standards, and the pesticides and fertilizers supplied to the farmers must be within the validity period.

　　面对“实惠”的考验
　　尹艺超  孙林经
    在一些不法商贩企图用各种手段套购肥、油、药而发不义之财的严峻挑战面前，山东省莱州市农业生产资料公司的干部职工，以模范的行动筑起了一道道防线，抵制住不正之风的侵蚀和金钱的诱惑。
    莱州市粮田面积达140多万亩，国家计划内调拨的标准肥和农药、农用地膜远远满足不了需要。因而一些不法商贩将生资公司视为自己的“财源”，想方设法企图打通“财路”。今年4月份，一自称采购员的外地人，找到莱州市生资公司党支部书记、经理孙显义，提出愿以每吨高出原价200元的价格，买一部分尿素。说着，这人从手提包里拿出两床毛毯、二瓶茅台酒和二条云烟，说是“小意思”，并劝老孙：“你是公司的一把手，这件事只要你点个头说句话就成，事后绝不亏待你。”老孙瞪了那人一眼：“我这权力是党和人民给的，损害党的威信，坑害农民的事，你给的好处再多，我也不干！”那人自知碰到“对头”，只好悻悻而去。后来，又有人上门暗示，只要卖给他们化肥，就给公司领导“回扣”，给职工解决点“福利”。
    在金钱和物质的诱惑面前，莱州市生资公司领导保持了清醒的头脑。他们在全公司开展了以反对“一切向钱看”为重点的思想教育活动，在全公司筑起了防腐堤坝，有效地增强了干部职工抵制不正之风侵蚀的能力。为满足当地果农急需，今年5月，该公司以每吨2.47万元的价格在青岛农药厂购买了3吨“久效磷”农药，刚出厂门，几个“药贩子”当即以每吨4.5万元的价格要求他们转卖。可这个公司的采购员没有动心，硬是一两也没卖。
    今年以来，化肥每百元销货额的经营管理费由3年前的1.8元上升为3.52元，在国家化肥价格不变的情况下，企业每经销1吨化肥亏损28.68元。一些商贩主动提出，只要将化肥转给他们，企业的亏损部分全由他们承担。对这些“好心人”，这个公司婉言谢绝：“公司的负担绝不能转嫁到农民身上，党和国家给农民的好处谁也甭想赚了去。”不管是国家拨来的，还是自己外采的，他们都按规定价格全部送到农民手中。
    为避免农民吃亏上当，这个公司还切实加强对计划外农业生产资料采购的管理，明确规定：农业生产资料的生产厂家必须是国家定点厂，产品质量必须达到国家规定标准，供给农民的农药、化肥等必须在有效期内。
