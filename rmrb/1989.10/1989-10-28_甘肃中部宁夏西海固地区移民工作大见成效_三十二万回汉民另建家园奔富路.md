In recent years, with the organization and support of the state, 320,000 Hui and Han people from central Gansu and the Liupan Mountains in western Ningxia have moved from impoverished and barren areas where "the land cannot support the people" to newly developed irrigation areas along the Yellow River, the Hexi Corridor, and the Hetao Plain. They have built new homes and shaken off poverty. People say, "It's great to be in a socialist society!"

The dry mountainous areas of central Gansu and the Liupan Mountains in western Ningxia have long been plagued by drought, making life difficult for their 7 million agricultural population. About 1.4 million of them live in areas where both water and land transportation are inaccessible, and the population is severely overloaded. Even with consecutive years of good harvests, they still rely on the government for grain, water, and fodder. What should be done for these 1.4 million impoverished farmers with no way out? In early 1983, the State Council's "Three Western" Region Agricultural Development Leading Group, after thorough investigation and deliberation, decided to relocate 900,000 of these people in phases to the Hexi Corridor, Hetao Plain, and newly developed Yellow River irrigation areas to cultivate wasteland and solve the problem of food security.

Practice has proven that the resettlement path is viable: the original plan to relocate 500,000 people over 10 years has already seen 320,000 people resettled. In central Gansu, counties such as Dingxi, Tongwei, and Zhuanglang have seen over 30,000 farmers settle in counties and cities like Zhangye, Gaotai, Jinta, and Anxi in the Hexi Corridor, thousands of miles away. This province has also resettled tens of thousands of people in the newly developed Yellow River irrigation areas. In the Liupan Mountains of western Ningxia, 9 cross-county resettlement bases have been established in the newly developed Yellow River irrigation areas, relocating 150,000 farmers and developing 380,000 mu of farmland. Most of these resettled people have achieved "settling in one year, solving food security in two years, and moving towards prosperity in three years." Recently, State Councilor Chen Junsheng inspected some of the resettlement villages and was thanked by many farmers who praised the Communist Party and socialism.

"Relocating one person eases the burden on two, and can solve the food security of three." According to calculations by Gansu Province, for every 100,000 people relocated from the impoverished mountainous areas, the remaining residents' farmland increases from 5 mu to 12 mu, and the population density per square kilometer decreases from 50 people to 20. This way, the remaining people can solve their livelihood problems through large-scale agriculture with livestock farming as the mainstay, and the ecological environment will also improve accordingly.

On one hand, the poverty alleviation problem in the mountainous areas is solved, and on the other hand, the development of the Hexi Corridor, Hetao Plain, and the new Yellow River irrigation areas is accelerated. It is understood that the Hexi Corridor can still develop 2.5 million mu of irrigated land in the near future, the Hetao Plain in Ningxia can still develop 2 million mu of irrigated land, and the development potential of the new Yellow River irrigation areas in Gansu and Ningxia is still very large. These places have superior water conservancy development conditions and are directly linked with the relocation of impoverished mountainous area residents, achieving two purposes with one investment. Now, the Hexi Corridor has become the main commercial grain base in Gansu.

　　甘肃中部宁夏西海固地区移民工作大见成效
　　三十二万回汉民另建家园奔富路
    新华社银川10月27日电　（记者王漫沧）近几年来，在国家组织和扶持下，甘肃中部和宁夏西海固地区的32万回、汉族人口，从“一方水土养活不了一方人”的穷山旮旯里搬迁到新开发的黄河灌区和河西走廊、河套平原建起新家园，摆脱了贫困。人们都说，还是社会主义好！
    甘肃中部干旱山区和宁夏的西海固地区700多万农业人口长期受干旱熬煎，生活困苦，其中约有140万人生活在“水路”、“旱路”都难以走通的地方，人口严重超载，即使连年风调雨顺，也要靠政府送粮、送水、送草。对这140万没有出路的贫困农民怎么办？1983年初，国务院“三西”地区农业建设领导小组经过充分调查论证，决定对其中90万人分期分批向河西走廊、河套平原和新开发的黄河灌区迁移，垦荒种植，解决温饱问题。
    实践证明，移民之路走通了：原计划在10年内迁移50万人，截至目前已妥善安排了32万人。甘肃中部的定西、通渭、庄浪等县已有3万多农民在千里之外的河西走廊张掖、高台、金塔、安西等县市安家落户。这个省还在新开发的黄河灌区安置移民十几万人。宁夏西海固地区在新发展的引黄灌区建成9处跨县移民基地，共迁移农民15万人，开发农田38万亩。这些移民大都实现了“一年安家，两年解决温饱，三年迈向富路”。最近，国务委员陈俊生在一些移民新村视察，许多农民十分感激地夸共产党好，社会主义好。
    “移出一个人，缓解两个人，可以解决三个人的温饱”。据甘肃省匡算，从贫困山区每迁出10万人，留居者的耕地由5亩增加到12亩，每平方公里人口密度由50人下降到20人。这样，留下的人可以通过搞以畜牧业为主的大农业，解决生活出路问题，生态环境也相应得到改善。
    一方面解决山区的扶贫问题，一方面又加快了河西、河套地区和黄河新灌区的开发。据了解，河西走廊近期还可发展水浇地250多万亩，宁夏河套平原还可发展水浇地200余万亩，甘、宁两省区黄河新灌区的开发潜力还很大。这些地方水利开发条件优越，直接与贫困山区移民挂钩，一笔资金就能达到两个目的。现在河西走廊已成为甘肃最主要商品粮基地。
