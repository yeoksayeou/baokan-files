Waitress Xia Mingrong Honestly Returns Found Gold

    A waitress at the Anhui Province Huaxi Hotel, Xia Mingrong, recently found six gold rings and eight pairs of gold earrings worth 6,000 yuan while cleaning a room. She promptly turned them in and returned them to the owner.

    The owner of the lost gold jewelry was an elderly Taiwanese compatriot named Xue Zhuochuan, a retired military officer from Taiwan. These items were gifts he intended to give to his nephews and nieces. Unfortunately, when the elderly man checked into the Huaxi Hotel on September 12, he had drunk a few too many glasses of wine at a friend's house and forgot the small package of jewelry he had tucked under his pillow. After Xia found the jewelry, she immediately thought it belonged to the elderly Taiwanese man. She rushed to the window, but the man was already gone. After some effort, she finally found out the man's exact address for his visit. A telegram informing him that his lost items had been found was sent, but the man did not receive it in time. Hoping for the best, the man came to the Huaxi Hotel to look for his belongings.

    When the gold jewelry was returned to his hands, the elderly man was overjoyed. He excitedly took Xia's hand and sighed, "Overseas, if something is lost, it is generally not returned. Even if it is returned, it is usually at a discount. It is truly the purity of the mainland people's hearts!"

　　服务员夏明荣拾“金”不昧
    本报讯　安徽省六安皖西宾馆女服务员夏明荣，最近在收拾房间时，发现价值6000元的6枚金戒指和8对金耳环，她如数上交，归还给失主。
    丢失这批金首饰的是一位老台胞，名叫薛卓传，台湾原退役军官。这是他给侄男侄女的见面礼。谁知当老人于9月12日投宿皖西宾馆时，由于在朋友家多喝了几杯，竟将随手塞在枕下的首饰包给忘了。服务员小夏捡到这金首饰后，马上想到是那位老台胞丢的，她快步奔向窗台，可是老人已无踪无影。经过一番周折，最后查出老人探亲的确切地址。一封告知失物已找到的电报发出了，可是老人未能及时收到电报。老人抱着侥幸的心理，来到皖西宾馆寻找。
    当金首饰回到手上时，老人异常兴奋，他激动地握住小夏的手感慨道：“在海外，要是丢失了东西，一般不会归还，即使归还也要打折扣，还是大陆人心纯洁啊！”
