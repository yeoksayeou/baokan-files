Cambodian Resistance Forces Liberate Western Stronghold of Bailyng
Already Control Large Areas in Western Cambodia

New China News Agency Bangkok, October 23 (Reporter Ma Shengrong) A senior official of the Cambodian resistance forces told our reporter this morning that the resistance forces captured the town of Bailyng, which was defended by the invading Vietnamese army and the Phnom Penh puppet forces, on the 22nd.

Bailyng is located in the southwestern part of the province of Battambang and is a strategic stronghold in the region. The resistance forces led by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea have been continuously attacking and capturing enemy outposts around Bailyng since August this year, making Bailyng an isolated town.

The senior official of the resistance forces said that the resistance forces launched a full-scale attack on Bailyng at around 4 AM on the 22nd and, after more than two hours of fierce fighting, captured the town by 6 AM.

He said that after capturing Bailyng, the resistance forces are consolidating their positions and preparing to expand their gains and continue their attacks on other areas occupied by the enemy.

New China News Agency Bangkok, October 23 (Reporters Huang Yong, Shao Linming) A source in the eastern border town of Aranyaprathet, Thailand, said today that the Cambodian resistance forces have already controlled large areas in western Cambodia.

The source said that the resistance forces have crossed the Thai-Cambodian border from Poipet and Sisophon, approaching Battambang, and have advanced more than 50 kilometers. The resistance forces have cut off an important bridge connecting National Highway 5 and Highway 502, threatening National Highway 5 and putting pressure on the enemy defending Phnom Penh. Currently, fierce battles are taking place in the eastern part of Phnom Penh, along National Highway 5, and in the Sisophon area.

The source pointed out that since the end of September, when Vietnam announced its "complete withdrawal" from Cambodia, the influence of the Cambodian resistance forces in the western region has significantly increased. More and more Cambodians are moving from the interior to the areas controlled by the resistance forces to make a living.

He said that the fierce offensive of the Cambodian resistance forces has caused the Phnom Penh army to become fearful, with growing war-weariness and desertions, and many are surrendering to the resistance forces.

　　柬抵抗力量解放西部重镇拜林
　　已控制柬西部大片地区
    新华社曼谷10月23日电  （记者马胜荣）柬埔寨抵抗力量的一位高级人士今天上午对本社记者说，抵抗力量于22日攻克了侵柬越军和金边伪军驻守的拜林镇。
    拜林镇位于马德望省西南部，是这一地区的战略重镇。民柬联合政府领导的抵抗力量从今年8月开始，连续攻占了拜林外围的敌人据点，使拜林成为一座孤镇。
    抵抗力量的这位高级人士说，抵抗力量于22日凌晨4时许向拜林镇展开总攻击，经过两个多小时的激战，于清晨6时攻下了拜林镇。
    他说，攻下拜林镇之后，抵抗部队正在巩固阵地，并准备扩大战果，继续向敌人占据的其他地区展开进攻。
    新华社曼谷10月23日电  （记者黄勇、邵林铭）据驻泰国东部边境城镇亚兰的一位人士今天说，柬埔寨抵抗力量已控制柬埔寨西部大片地区。
    这位人士说，抵抗力量已从泰柬边境越过波贝、诗梳风，靠近马德望，深入50多公里。抵抗力量已切断联结5号公路和502号公路的一座重要桥梁，对5号公路形成威胁，对梅莱山的守敌造成压力。目前，战斗正在梅莱山东部、5号公路沿线和诗梳风地区激烈进行。
    这位人士指出，从9月底越南宣布从柬埔寨“完全撤军”以来，柬埔寨抵抗力量在西部地区的影响大增。越来越多的柬埔寨人从内地迁往抵抗力量控制地区谋生。
    他说，柬埔寨抵抗力量的猛烈攻势，使金边军队产生恐惧心理，厌战情绪增长，纷纷开小差向抵抗力量投诚。
