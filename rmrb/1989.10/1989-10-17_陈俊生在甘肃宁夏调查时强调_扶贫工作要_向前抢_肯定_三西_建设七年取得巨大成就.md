State Councilor and Director of the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas Chen Junsheng recently emphasized during his inspection of poverty-stricken areas in Gansu and Ningxia provinces that accelerating economic development in these regions and consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation are crucial. He stressed that strengthening the organizational structure at the county and township levels and political and ideological work is of paramount importance. As long as cadres at all levels fully exert their subjective initiative, lead the masses, and work together with determination, the goal of fundamentally changing the face of poverty-stricken areas can be ensured.

From October 5 to October 13, Chen Junsheng visited over 30 households of different types in the Dingxi region of Gansu and the western part of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, understanding their production and living conditions, and listening to their opinions and appeals. He also inspected several typical small watershed comprehensive treatment projects, relocated villages, township enterprises, and private enterprises, and held discussions with grassroots cadres to jointly plan for poverty alleviation and prosperity.

The regions Chen Junsheng inspected are the largest poverty-stricken areas in China, known as the "crown of poverty." Seven years ago, the State Council decided to prioritize the development and construction of the "Three Wests" (Dingxi region of Gansu, the commercial grain area of the Hexi Corridor, and the western part of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) as a key national agricultural regional development project. Since 1983, 200 million yuan has been allocated annually for 10 years to support this initiative. Chen Junsheng was pleased to see that over the past seven years, significant achievements have been made in the "Three Wests" construction. Originally, 70% of the households were impoverished, but now more than 85% of these people have solved their food and clothing problems, and some farmers have already embarked on the path to prosperity. In the places he visited, most farmers were smiling, and the sad expressions of the past were rarely seen. Chen Junsheng happily said, "You have already removed the hat of China's poverty crown!"

The focus of Chen Junsheng's inspection this time was on how to further develop the "Three Wests" poverty alleviation work in the future. He believes that the current poverty alleviation work in the "Three Wests" faces issues of imbalance, instability, and lack of implementation. Therefore, in future economic development, it is necessary to further adjust the single household farming structure, explore more production avenues, combine long-term and short-term projects, and integrate planting, breeding, and household sideline industries. This way, farmers will have some reliable income sources, and natural disasters will not cause significant fluctuations. At the same time, the diversification of household industries should be combined with the formation of regional leading industries, building leading and backbone projects, leveraging two advantages, and forming large-scale commercial production.

After inspecting several small watershed comprehensive treatment projects, Chen Junsheng pointed out that this is an important achievement in the long-term construction of the "Three Wests" and a sign of the "green revolution" on the Loess Plateau. If this is done well, it will not only be significant for changing the natural and poverty-stricken appearance of the western region but also a major contribution to maintaining the survival environment of the entire Chinese nation.

Addressing some concerns, Chen Junsheng repeatedly emphasized in his discussions with local grassroots cadres that developing individual economies and private enterprises is an important path for the masses in poverty-stricken areas to escape poverty and become prosperous. This policy should not be hesitated, wavered, or changed. Under the premise of legal operation and tax compliance, there should be no fear of the development of individual and private economies. Activities in the circulation sector can also be carried out. Money earned from business can first solve the problem of food and clothing, and after accumulating more, it can be directed towards real businesses, absorbing the labor force of impoverished households. There have already been successful examples in this regard, and bold support for development should be given.

Chen Junsheng pointed out that there are many experiences to be summarized in poverty alleviation work, but the fundamental one is the spiritual state of the people. Leading cadres at all levels must have a sense of urgency and a proactive spirit in poverty alleviation work. They must carry out a competition. This competition is a competition of human quality and requires strengthening political and ideological work.

    陈俊生在甘肃宁夏调查时强调
    扶贫工作要“向前抢”
    肯定“三西”建设七年取得巨大成就
    据新华社银川10月16日电　（记者王漫沧）国务委员、国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组组长陈俊生最近在甘肃、宁夏两省区的贫困地区调查研究后强调指出，加快贫困地区的经济开发速度，巩固已经取得的扶贫成果，十分重要的问题是必须加强县、乡组织建设，加强政治思想工作。只要各级干部充分发挥主观能动性，带领群众，同心协力，卧薪尝胆，彻底改变贫困地区面貌的目标就有保证。
    从10月5日到10月13日，陈俊生在甘肃定西地区和宁夏西海固地区走访了30多个不同类型的农户，了解他们的生产、生活情况，倾听他们的意见和呼声。他还视察了当地一些小流域综合治理典型、吊庄移民新村、乡镇企业和私人企业，同基层干部座谈，共商脱贫致富大计。
    陈俊生这次调查的地区是我国最大的一块贫困区，被称为“贫困之冠”。7年前，国务院决定把“三西”（甘肃的定西地区、河西走廊商品粮区、宁夏的西海固地区）建设列为全国农业区域性开发建设的重点，从1983年起，在10年内每年拨专款2亿元予以扶持。这次陈俊生高兴地看到，7年来“三西”建设已经取得了巨大的成就。原来有70％的农户是贫困户，现在这些人85％以上解决了温饱问题，一部分农民已经走上了富路。所到之处，大部分农民面带欢笑，过去那种愁苦相已很少见。陈俊生高兴地说：“中国贫困之冠的帽子你们已经摘了！”
    “三西”建设今后如何进一步发展，是陈俊生这次调查研究的主题。他认为，“三西”的扶贫工作目前存在着不平衡、不稳定、不落实的问题。为此，在今后的经济开发中，要进一步调整单一的农户家庭经营结构，多找一些生产门路，长效项目和短效项目结合，种植业、养殖业和家庭工副业结合，让农户有些“铁杆庄稼”，这样就可以不因自然灾害而出现大的变幅。同时，要把一家一户的产业多样化同区域性主导产业的形成结合起来，建设龙头骨干项目，发挥两个优势，形成较大规模的商品性生产。
    陈俊生在看了几处小流域综合治理工程之后指出，这是“三西”长期建设的一项重要成就，是黄土高原“绿色革命”的曙光。这件事办好了，不仅对改变西北地区的自然面貌、贫困落后面貌意义重大，也是对维护整个中华民族的生存环境的重大贡献。
    针对一些人的顾虑，陈俊生在同当地基层干部的座谈中一再强调，发展个体经济和私人企业是贫困地区群众脱贫致富的一条重要出路，对这个政策不要犹豫，不要动摇，不要改变。在守法经营、照章纳税的前提下，不要怕个体户、私人经济的发展。流通领域的活动也可以搞，经商赚的钱，首先解决温饱，有了更多的积累后引向办实业，吸收贫困户的劳动力，这方面已经有了成功典型，要大胆支持发展。
    陈俊生指出，扶贫工作的经验可以总结很多条，人的精神状况是根本的一条。各级领导班子，各级干部对扶贫工作一定要有“紧迫感，向前抢”的精神，要开展一场竞赛。这场竞赛是人的素质的竞赛，要加强政治思想工作。
