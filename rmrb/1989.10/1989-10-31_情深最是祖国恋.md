Title: Deepest Love is for the Motherland

Edition: 1

This year's National Day celebration was quite lively! However, my home seemed rather quiet. My son and daughter-in-law, daughter and son-in-law, have all settled abroad; my elder brother, younger brother, and younger sister have long since left the mainland. Now, only my spouse and I remain here. "Every festive occasion brings a pang of homesickness." But for me, "the deepest love is for the motherland."

I was born in Hong Kong in 1931. My father was the manager of a bank branch. Our family's living conditions were quite comfortable, but I could not bear the humiliation of being a subject of a conquered nation. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, schools were only allowed to teach one book, "East Asia Co-Prosperity." I hated the Japanese devils. So, I returned to my ancestral home in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, to study, and later completed my high school education in Guangzhou.

In 1949, I witnessed the liberation of Guangzhou. The Chinese people were no longer bullied by others. I remember being so happy that I couldn't sleep for several nights. Although our country was still poor, she was after all the mother who gave birth to my parents and ancestors. Building her up was not only the responsibility but also the duty of every Chinese. Therefore, I declined the repeated advice of my relatives to continue my studies and instead joined the People's Liberation Army. In this great school of the people's army, I received excellent training, and my ideological awareness continuously improved. In 1953, I was honored to join the Communist Party of China.

However, for a long period, my patriotic heart was not understood. Some even said, "Zhang Jingtang gave up his comfortable life to join the army to suffer, he must have some special purpose." During the Cultural Revolution, some even publicly accused me of being a spy sent from abroad. Hearing this, I was extremely painful, but my will to serve the motherland never wavered. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, my reputation was finally restored.

In 1979, the organization approved my visit to Hong Kong and New Zealand to see my siblings whom I hadn't seen for 30 years. In Hong Kong, my relatives, due to various reasons, did not fully understand our current policies and repeatedly advised me to stay. My younger siblings said: Hong Kong is your birthplace, and according to the regulations here, you can be considered a Hong Kong citizen. They also said: Here, you don't need to work; just inheriting your parents' estate is enough for you to enjoy life. However, they did not understand me. I have always believed that in this world, apart from material enjoyment, there are more sublime things, that is, spiritual life; if one's spirit is impoverished, no matter how much wealth one has, one may not necessarily be happy. So I told them, I know what you are saying, but my destiny is on the mainland, I cannot leave my career there. I also used what I saw and heard to promote the party's reform and opening-up policy to them. In the end, I returned to the country on time without hesitation.

In 1987, my spouse and I visited Hong Kong and New Zealand again. My son is now a manager of a company in New Zealand, and he and his wife each have a "Toyota" car and have bought a small house with a garden. Upon arriving in Auckland, New Zealand, my son drove me around the entire country. On the way, my son again said to me: Dad, come here, forget everything. I said: Son, your father is a member of the Communist Party, how can I forget everything? Your father, from a subject of a conquered nation to a professor, is it not the party's cultivation? Moreover, I cannot leave the motherland and people who have nurtured me for 40 years, nor can I leave my teachers, friends, comrades, especially my patients, my God.

"Patients, patients, you can come here to treat diseases, the medical conditions here are much better than in the country."

"The medical conditions in the country may be poor, but my role here may not be small, nor is it smaller than that of your uncles and aunts."

I said this with a basis. If we compare wealth, I indeed cannot compare with them. But I also have my "wealth." I am a chief physician. In these years, the number of patients I have treated is countless. Since 1983, I have co-authored 35 medical papers published in provincial-level and above journals, and have produced 13 scientific research achievements, all of which have won awards. Due to some achievements in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, I was appointed as the leader of the cardiovascular professional group of the Chengdu Military Region, and also served as the vice-chairman of the Cardiovascular Internal Medicine Society of the Yunnan Branch of the Chinese Medical Association and a member of the Cardiovascular Internal Medicine Academic Committee of the entire army. Can these be calculated with money? So I explained to my children: People have different aspirations, my path is my own choice. My roots are in China, I love that land. Those who gave birth to me are my parents, but those who taught me how to be a person are the party, the motherland, and the army. Being able to dedicate everything to the motherland is my lifelong happiness and satisfaction.

Thus, I returned on time for the second time after my second trip abroad, from the vast blue sky back to the bountiful land, back to the post I cannot leave, and I felt very down-to-earth.

    《共和国与我》征文活动到此结束，感谢广大作者、读者的支持，日后将公布获奖名单。
                                ——编者
    今年的国庆节好热闹啊！可是我的家却显得很冷清，儿子、儿媳，女儿、女婿都出国定居了；哥哥、弟弟、妹妹们也早已离开了大陆，现在这里只有我和老伴。“每逢佳节倍思亲”。不过，对于我来说，“情深最是祖国恋”。
    我1931年生于香港，父亲原是一家银行的分行经理。家庭生活条件还是比较优越的，但是，那种当亡国奴的耻辱，我却无法忍受。在日本人占领香港期间，规定学校不论高低年级，只准教一本书，即《东亚共荣》。我恨透了日本鬼子。于是，只身回到祖籍广东省中山县上学，后来在广州读完高中。
    1949年，我亲眼看到了广州的解放，中国人不再受人欺负了。我记得，当时我高兴得好几晚睡不好觉。虽然祖国还很贫穷，但不管怎么说，她毕竟是生养我父母、祖辈的母亲啊，把她建设好，不仅是每个中华儿女的责任，也是义务嘛！所以，我谢绝了亲人的再三劝阻，弃学从戎，参加中国人民解放军。在人民军队这所大学校里，我受到了很好的锻炼，思想觉悟不断提高，1953年光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    然而，在相当长的一个时期内，我的一份赤子之心没有被理解，有人还说什么“张景韬放弃了优越的生活条件跑到部队里来吃苦，肯定怀有特殊的目的”，“文革”期间甚至有人公开说我是国外派来的间谍。听到这些我痛苦极了，但我报效祖国的意志始终没有动摇。党的十一届三中全会后，我的名誉终于得到恢复。
    1979年，组织上批准我到香港和新西兰探望离别了30年的兄妹。到了香港，我的亲人由于种种原因，对我们的现行政策不够了解，再三劝我留下。我的弟妹都说：香港是你的出生地，按这里的规定，你可算香港公民。并且说：在这里，你无须工作，只要继承父母遗产，就足够你享受一辈子。其实，他们并不了解我。我历来认为，在这个世界上，除了物质享受外，还有更崇高的东西，那就是精神生活；如果精神贫乏，财富再多，也不一定幸福。所以我对他们说，你们讲的我都知道，但我的归宿在大陆，我离不开我在那里的事业。我还用我看到的听到的事情向他们宣传党的改革开放政策。最后，我毫不犹豫地按时回国了。
    1987年，我和老伴又一次前往香港、新西兰探亲。我的儿子现在新西兰当上了一个公司的经理，他和妻子每人有一辆“丰田”小轿车，还自己买了一栋小楼，还有花园。到了新西兰的奥克兰，儿子开车带我周游了整个新西兰。在旅游的路上，儿子再次对我说：爸，来这里吧，什么也不要了。我说：孩子，爸爸是中共党员，怎么能什么也不要呢？爸爸从一个亡国奴到教授，不是党的培养，能成吗？更何况我离不开40年养育我的祖国、人民啊！还有我的师长、朋友、同志，特别是我的上帝——病人。
    “病人，病人，你来这里照样可以医病，这里的医疗条件比国内好得多”。
      “国内医疗条件虽差，但我发挥的作用不一定比在这里小，也不比你叔叔伯伯的小。”
    我说这话是有根据的。如果比财富，我确实不如他们。但是，我也有我的“财富”。我是主任医师，这些年来，我医治的病人无法计算。1983年以来，我与他人合作的医学论文，在省级以上刊物上发表的就有35篇，搞出的科研成果13项，而且项项得奖。由于在心血管病的医治上有一些建树，我被任命为成都军区心血管专业组组长，还担任了中华医学会云南分会心血管内科协会副主任委员、全军心血管内科学术委员会委员。这些难道用金钱能计算得出来吗？所以我向孩子们解释：人各有志，我的路是我自己选择的。我的根在中国，我爱那片国土。生我者父母，教我如何做人的却是党、是祖国、是军队。能把我的一切献给祖国，是我终生的幸福和满足。
    就这样，我第二次出国，又按时回来了，从万里蓝天回到了丰收的大地，回到了我离不开的工作岗位，心里觉得踏踏实实。
