This inspection has greatly enriched my understanding of nature conservation.

First, protect nature from an ecological perspective. I asked a seasoned park director in France, "What is your most important experience?" He replied, "I think the most important thing is to understand your own conservation area. This is not an easy task because there are very complex and subtle relationships between birds, animals, plants, the environment, and human activities. Often, assumptions are wrong." I also heard the opposite lesson: In the Olympic National Park in the United States, someone introduced 6 mountain goats in 1925, and now there are more than 1,000. Later, the park discovered that these alien animals had endangered some unique plants, affecting the local ecology. They wanted to eliminate them, but the law prohibits hunting in national parks; moreover, these animals live on steep cliffs, making hunting very dangerous. The park had to use helicopters to capture these animals, costing $1,000 per capture, and still could not control the population. Now, it has become a thorny issue in the park that cannot be eliminated but is harmful if left alone. The Soviet Union recognized this problem and explicitly stipulated: Absolutely no introduction of alien organisms in conservation areas. This made me think of Michurin's words: "Nature never makes mistakes because it has no brain."

Second, correct the relationship between humans and nature. An American journalist asked me to share my impressions of American nature conservation. I mentioned many good points but also frankly criticized the phenomenon of American waste of natural resources. I said that Americans can live so comfortably because, on one hand, they have unique natural resources, and on the other hand, they have exploited the wealth of other countries and transferred natural destruction to others. They only care about their own development and spread pollution to other countries, which has become an unresolved lawsuit in Europe. For a long time, we have formed a wrong idea: humans seem to be able to change everything, conquer everything, and overcome everything.

It is still Engels who said well: "We should not be too intoxicated with our victories over nature. For every such victory, nature takes its revenge on us..." Therefore, we must change our mindset, acknowledge that we are members of the natural world, not its masters, and must accept the constraints of natural laws. No matter how smart our brains are, how strong our power is, or how glorious our achievements are, we must learn to live in harmony with nature.

Third, we all live on the same Earth. During this visit, no matter where I went, I always lived in an ocean of friendship. The fundamental reason is that I love nature, he loves nature, and we all love nature. The "global consciousness" of nature conservation binds us together. As mentioned earlier, natural destruction does not recognize national borders, and nature conservation is also borderless. Many things in nature are not just matters of one country or region. White cranes breed in northwestern Siberia in the Soviet Union but winter in Poyang Lake in China; geese tagged in Qinghai's Bird Island fly far to the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean; sea turtles caught in China have release tags from the London Research Institute; the world's most famous wild horses roam the border between China and Mongolia. China's Yangtze alligators and America's Mississippi alligators, China's antelopes and North America's musk oxen, although geographically unrelated, have a special kinship. All this shows that protecting the nature of one country is protecting a part of the Earth; destroying the nature of one country is destroying a part of the Earth. Moreover, the condition of this part will inevitably affect the entire Earth. More and more people realize that we live on the same Earth.

In the field of nature conservation, there are three main points worth learning from abroad.

First, a strong consciousness of nature conservation. No matter where I went, I could always hear the voices of protecting nature. At the entrance of some national parks, there are signs that read: "Leave only footprints when entering, take only photos when leaving." I saw that 90% of the tourists did this. This is due to the role of conservation awareness. This conservation awareness is reflected in all aspects. Bush's victory in the presidential election was partly due to the addition of an environmental protection clause in his election platform.

Second, nature conservation organizations in Europe and America have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. These mass organizations have at least played the following roles: first, they are a form of self-education for the masses; second, they can do many practical things; third, they can supervise and assist the government in developing nature conservation. Because these organizations are run by the masses, whoever does more good deeds has more appeal and cohesion, and can gain the support and assistance of all sectors of society. Some people are even willing to donate their land, forests, estates, and inheritances. They feel that handing over green mountains and clear waters to society for protection is more meaningful than leaving them to their descendants. Therefore, such organizations are becoming bigger and bigger, with some having tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of members, playing a crucial role in their country's nature conservation.

Third, these countries have a fairly mature set of experiences in building national parks and nature reserves, and in handling tourism, hunting, forest fires, and other aspects. I will only share one thought. Before going abroad, I was very opposed to developing tourism in domestic nature reserves. After visiting Europe, especially after visiting the Environmental Ecology Research Institute under the Smithsonian Institution, my understanding has changed. The head of the institute told me, "Over the decades, we have done some things and achieved some results, which should be shown to everyone. Moreover, the environment here is open and beautiful. After excavating lakes and cultivating forests, there are also many wild birds and animals. Some places should be opened for tourism to educate the public about loving science and nature. In this way, the leadership and the masses will be more willing to support us in doing research." I think this is a new trend. Research institutes develop tourism, conservation areas do research, and zoos and botanical gardens do ecology, developing horizontally, and turning tourism into the best classroom for educating the public to recognize, love, and protect nature.

    环球绿色考察归来（下）
    唐锡阳
    这次考察大大丰富了我有关自然保护的认识。
    第一，用生态学的观点保护自然。我问过法国一位经验丰富的保护区主任：“你最主要的经验是什么？”他说：
  “我想最重要的一条，是要认识自己的保护区。这不是一件容易的事，因为鸟、兽、植物、环境和人类活动之间，存在着非常复杂而微妙的关系。想当然常常是错误的。”反面的教训也听到了：在美国奥林匹克国家公园里，有人在1925年放养了6只石山羊，到现在已繁殖到1000多只。后来公园发现这种客籍动物已危及一些特有植物，影响到当地生态，想消灭它。但国家有法律规定，国家公园内禁止狩猎；而且这种动物栖息在人迹罕至的悬崖峭壁上，狩猎非常危险。公园只好使用直升机活捕这种动物，每捕一只的花费高达1000美元，还远远控制不住数量，现在已成为公园内一个除之不能，任之有害的棘手问题。苏联认识到这个问题，就明文规定：保护区内绝对禁止引进外来生物。这使我联想到米丘林的一句话：“自然界是不会错的，因为他没有脑子。”
    第二，端正人和自然的关系。一位美国记者要我谈对美国自然保护的观感时，我谈了很多好的印象，也直言不讳地批评了美国浪费自然资源的现象。我说，美国人所以生活得这么惬意，一方面靠自己得天独厚的自然资源，另方面是剥夺了别国人民的财富，并且把自然破坏转嫁给别人。只顾自己发展，而把污染源扩散到别的国家，在欧洲已成为一场打不清的官司。长期以来，我们形成了一种错误的观念：人类似乎可以改造一切，征服一切，战胜一切。
    还是恩格斯说得好：“我们不要过分陶醉于我们对自然的胜利。对于每一次这样的胜利，自然界都报复了我们……”因此我们必须改变观念，承认自己是自然界的一员，而不是自然界的主宰，必须接受自然规律的束缚。不管我们的脑子如何聪明，力量如何强大，成果如何显赫，我们必须学会和大自然和谐相处。
    第三，我们共同生活在一个地球上。我这次出访过程中，无论走到哪里，总是生活在友谊的海洋之中。根本原因是我爱大自然，他爱大自然，我们都爱大自然。自然保护的“全球意识”把我们联系在一起。如前面提到的，自然破坏分不清国界，自然保护也是没有国界的。自然界的许多事物本来就不是一国一地的事情，白鹤在苏联西北利亚繁殖，却在中国鄱阳湖越冬；在青海鸟岛环志的斑头雁，远飞到印度洋的孟加拉湾；中国捕到的海龟，有伦敦研究所的放流标志；世界最著名的动物野马，是活动在中蒙边界上。中国的扬子鳄和美国的密河鳄，中国的牛羚和北美的麝牛，虽然地理上毫无联系，但在亲缘上确有着特殊的关系。这一切都说明，保护了一国的自然，就是保护了地球的一个部分；破坏了一国的自然，就是破坏了地球的一个部分。而且这个部分的状况如何，必然要影响到整个地球。越来越多的人认识到，我们是生活在同一个地球上。
    在自然保护方面，外国值得我们学习的主要有3点。
    第一，强烈的自然保护意识。不论我走到哪里，到处都可以听到保护自然的声音。有的国家公园的门口，立着这样的牌子：“进去只留下脚印，出来只带走照片。”我看90％的游客都做到了。这就在于保护意识的作用。这种保护意识反映在各个方面。布什竞选总统取胜，原因之一是他的竞选纲领中多了一条保护环境。
    第二，欧美这些国家的自然保护组织有如雨后春笋。这些群众性的组织至少发挥了以下作用：首先，它是群众自我教育的形式；其次，能办很多的实事；最后，它能监督和协助政府发展自然保护事业。因为这些组织都是群众自己办的，谁的好事办得多，谁就具有吸引力、凝聚力，谁就能得到社会各界的拥护和资助，有些人甚至愿意把自己的土地、森林、庄园和遗产捐献出来。他们觉得把绿水青山交给社会保护起来，比留给自己的子孙更有意义。所以这样的组织越办越大，有的拥有几十万、几百万会员，对他们国家自然保护事业起着举足轻重的作用。
    第三，这些国家在建设国家公园和自然保护区，在处理旅游、狩猎、森林火灾等等方面，都有一套比较成熟的经验。这里只谈一点感想。出国之前，我对国内自然保护区搞旅游十分反感，访问了欧洲，特别是访问了史密森宁研究院领导下的环境生态研究所以后，我的认识有所变化。这个所的负责人告诉我，他说：“几十年来我们做了些什么，有什么成果，应该让大家都来看看。而且这里环境开阔，很美，经过开凿湖泊，培植森林，各种野鸟野兽也很多，应该开放部分地方作为旅游，教育群众热爱科学、热爱自然的课堂。这样领导机关和群众就会更乐意资助我们办科研。”我认为这是一种新的动向，研究所搞旅游，保护区搞科研，动物园和植物园搞生态，横向发展，把旅游办成教育群众认识自然、热爱自然、保护自然的最好课堂。
