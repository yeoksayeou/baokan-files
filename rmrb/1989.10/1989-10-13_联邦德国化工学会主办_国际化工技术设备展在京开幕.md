The international chemical technology equipment exhibition, organized by the Federal Republic of Germany Chemical Society and hosted by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade Exhibition Center, opened on October 11 and will run until October 17 at the China International Exhibition Center. This is the first time the exhibition has been held in Asia.

Previous international chemical technology equipment exhibitions have been held in Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany. In recent years, the chemical industry in the Far East has developed rapidly, prompting the organizers to decide to hold corresponding exhibitions in Beijing every two to three years.

This year, 19 countries and regions are participating in the exhibition. To celebrate the opening of the exhibition, the German Chemical Society held a grand reception yesterday. Attendees included Zhang Jingfu, a standing committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Minister of the Chemical Industry Gu Xiu Lian, and Zheng Hongye, President of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the China International Chamber of Commerce.
