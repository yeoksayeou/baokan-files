The people of Nanhanji Village in the suburbs of Beijing's Zhoukou Store Township proudly declare, "Our Dragon Bone Mountain is a land of heroes and spirits. It is not only the hometown of our ancient ancestors, the 'Peking Man,' but also the cradle of modern 'big stars'—not stars of song or film, but 'labor stars'!"

The "labor stars" they refer to are two national labor models: Sun Shuxin, the party branch secretary of Nanhanji Village, and the former party branch secretary, Xu Qingwen.

It is indeed remarkable and challenging for a small village with only 317 households to produce two national labor models.

Xu and Sun represent two generations of the village, as well as two generations of labor models in the Republic.

Thirty-two years ago, when Sun Shuxin was in the third grade of primary school, one evening under the moonlight on Dragon Bone Mountain, he saw a man who looked like a "black iron tower" standing under the old locust tree in the village center, speaking to the entire village. This was Xu Qingwen, a demobilized soldier who had just returned to the village. He had participated in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, had been wounded nine times, and had been awarded seven military merits. He had served as a deputy battalion commander and was a second-class disabled veteran. However, when he was demobilized, he did not want to enjoy a comfortable life in the city and instead chose to return to his hometown to take on the responsibility of being the village party branch secretary. He called on his fellow villagers to work hard and change the poor conditions of "Nanhanji, a high platform in drought, lacking grain, clothes, and firewood."

Later, Old Xu led the villagers to work tirelessly, enduring hunger and cold, to dig 61 deep wells, irrigating 95% of the arable land. The average yield per acre increased from 50 kilograms to 535 kilograms. Nanhanji became a red flag for high-yield agriculture in Beijing, and Xu Qingwen became a national labor model. Sun Shuxin felt that Old Xu was amazing, and in his composition for his Chinese class, he wrote: "This is the hero in my life, and I aspire to learn from Old Xu."

Old Xu also paid attention to and cared for Shuxin's growth. In 1973, the day after Sun Shuxin returned to the village from the artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army, Party Secretary Old Xu talked to him, saying, "Shuxin, you graduated from junior high school, served in the army for a few years, and joined the party. Take root in the countryside, and let's work together!" Shuxin listened to Old Xu.

Old Xu saw that Shuxin was a good seedling and kept putting more responsibilities on the young man. In 1982, at the age of 34, Shuxin became the brigade leader, overseeing the grain production of the entire brigade. That year, the grain yield in Nanhanji Village reached a new level, creating a record of an average yield of one ton per acre.

Old Xu and Shuxin worked together to implement the Party's reform and opening-up policy, and the agriculture, industry, and sideline production in Nanhanji all developed rapidly. In early 1984, the village borrowed 7 million yuan to build a medium-sized cement factory. However, during the construction of the factory, unfortunately, one person was crushed to death and two were injured. Old Party Secretary Xu Qingwen was anxious and brought his luggage to the construction site, taking charge personally. Unfortunately, this 64-year-old old man was also taken away by life due to coal gas poisoning at night.

The villagers all shed tears. Sun Shuxin fainted several times. At the critical moment when Nanhanji was striving to overcome poverty, Sun Shuxin lost a respected elder and a guide in his life. Some people were spreading rumors: "Once Old Xu dies, the red flag of agriculture in Nanhanji will be down!"

The village held an election for the party branch, and all 45 party members unanimously voted for Sun Shuxin to be the secretary. At that time, Shuxin's heart was pounding, wondering if he could carry on Old Xu's legacy?

Five years have passed in the blink of an eye. Shuxin has done a great job. The cement factory was built and put into production, the loan was repaid, and 11 enterprises, including a wire factory and an electric shaver factory, were developed. The products are sold to more than ten countries and regions, including Japan, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Now, the village's agricultural production has achieved mechanization and sprinkler irrigation, ensuring a stable harvest in both drought and flood conditions. The village has maintained an average yield of one ton per acre for eight consecutive years, delivering 365,000 kilograms of commercial grain to the state each year, with an average of over 400 kilograms per person. This year, the village's total economic income and net income will exceed last year's level, reaching 16.2 million yuan and 3.26 million yuan, respectively. The village has also built 182 two-story houses, improving the living conditions of 200 households. In the past two years, Nanhanji has been rated as a municipal-level "civilized village."

On the fifth night after the National Day, Shuxin reported the grandeur of the National Labor Model Conference at a full village meeting. As he spoke, his eyes welled up with tears. He said that if Old Xu were still alive, he would also have been invited to attend this conference.

　　两颗“劳动明星”
　　——南韩继村孙书新和徐庆文的帮学故事
　　本报记者　张书政
    “咱们龙骨山人杰地灵，既是远古祖先‘北京人’的故乡，也是现代‘大明星’的摇篮——不是歌星、影星，而是‘劳动明星’！”说这话的京郊周口店乡南韩继村的人流露出一种自豪的神气。
    他们所说的“劳动明星”，是指两位全国劳模，即南韩继村党支书孙书新和该村原党支书徐庆文。
    一个只有317户人家的小村，居然出了两个全国劳模，确实不简单，也不容易。
    徐、孙是村里的两代人，也是共和国的两代劳模。
    32年前，孙书新念小学3年级时，一天晚上，月亮爬上龙骨山，他看见一个长得像“黑铁塔”似的人，站在村中央老槐树下给全村群众讲话。这是刚刚回村的转业军人徐庆文，他参加过抗日战争和解放战争，身上9处受伤，荣立7次战功，曾任副营长，又是二级残废，但他转业时不愿进城享清福，毅然回老家挑起村党支书的重担。他号召乡亲们艰苦奋斗，改变“南韩继，旱高台，缺粮缺衣又缺柴”的贫困面貌。
    之后老徐带领村里人起早贪黑、挨饿受冻地打出61眼深水井，使95％的耕地浇上水，粮食平均亩产由50公斤增加到535公斤。南韩继成为北京市农业创高产的一面红旗，徐庆文也成为全国劳模。孙书新感到老徐大叔了不起，他在语文课的“作文”里写道：“这就是我身边的英雄人物，我立志向老徐大叔学习。”
    老徐也留意并关心书新的成长。1973年，孙书新从解放军炮兵某部退伍回村的第二天，党支书老徐就找他谈话，说：“书新哪，初中毕业啦，又当了几年兵，还入了党，扎根农村吧，咱们一块干！”书新听了老徐大叔的话。
    老徐看出书新是个好苗子，不断往这小伙子身上压担子。1982年，书新34岁，当了大队长，主管全大队粮食生产。这一年，南韩继村粮食产量又迈上新台阶，首创平均亩产吨粮的高产纪录。
    老徐和书新同心协力贯彻党的改革开放政策，南韩继农业和工、副业都上得很快。1984年初，村里贷款70万元兴建一座中型水泥厂。但是，盖厂房时，不幸轧死1人、轧伤2人。老支书徐庆文急了，把行李卷背到工地，亲自坐阵。十分不幸，这位64岁的老人，因夜里煤气中毒，也被夺去生命。
    村里人都落泪了。孙书新哭昏了几次。南韩继治穷致富的关键时刻失去主帅，孙书新失去一位可敬的长辈和人生路上的引路人。有人在传言：“老徐一死，南韩继这面农业红旗就歇了！”
    村里改选党支部，45名党员齐刷刷地举手，选孙书新当支书。当时，书新心里直打鼓，我能接好老徐这个班吗？
    一晃5年过去了。书新干得真不赖。水泥厂建成投产了，还清了贷款，又发展起电线厂、电须刀厂等11个企业，产品远销日本、美国、苏联等十几个国家和地区。如今，该村农业生产实现了机械化、喷灌化，旱、涝保收。全村已保持连续8年平均亩产吨粮的高产纪录，每年都向国家交售商品粮36.5万公斤，人均交粮400多公斤。今年村里经济总收入和纯收入将超过去年水平，分别可达1620万元和326万元。村里还建成182幢二层小楼，改善了200户人家的住房条件。这两年，南韩继被评为市级“文明村”。
    国庆节过后的第5个晚上，书新在全村大会上汇报着全国劳模大会的盛况，讲着讲着，他的眼睛湿润了，他说，如果老徐大叔还活着，他也会被邀请出席这次大会的。
