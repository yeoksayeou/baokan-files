The memorial hall for Marshal Ye Jianying opened in Meixian County today, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and the unveiling of Ye's bronze statue.

The memorial hall is located in Ye's hometown, Meixian County, Yanyang Town, Yan Shang Village, Guangdong Province. State Chairman Yang Shangkun inscribed the name of the memorial hall, and State Vice Chairman Wang Zhen cut the ribbon and unveiled the bronze statue.

The memorial hall, built with donations from overseas compatriots, is a two-story building covering nearly 2,000 square meters. On either side of the entrance are relief sculptures depicting Ye's life. A 2-meter-tall bronze statue of Ye in military uniform stands on a platform to the left of the memorial hall's entrance. Inside the memorial hall are five exhibition rooms displaying nearly 300 photographs of Ye, 50 items he used during his lifetime, including his bedding and office supplies, arranged as they were originally. The exhibits vividly record Ye's journey from exploring revolutionary truths and dedicating himself to the country, to becoming a highly respected founding leader and outstanding leader of the Party and the military, showcasing his revolutionary spirit of "devoting oneself to the great cause of communism, and making the world bloom with red flowers."

At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Lin Ruo, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, reminisced and praised Ye's immense contributions to the revolutionary and construction causes of the Chinese people. He said that at many crucial historical turning points in China's revolution, Ye was unwaveringly loyal to the revolution, had a keen insight into the overall situation, was decisive and bold, and turned the tide, making indelible contributions to the Party and the people. His deeds are immortalized in history, and his fame endures in the hearts of the people.

Lin Ruo said that Ye had devoted his heart and soul to the rejuvenation of China and was delighted with the achievements of reform and opening up. Today, we should carry forward the revolutionary traditions cultivated by the older generation, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and persist in reform and opening up, striving to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized nation.

Attending the opening ceremony were also leaders from the Party, government, military, and Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch in Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, Meizhou City, and Meixian County, as well as relatives of Marshal Ye Jianying, overseas and Hong Kong-Macao notables Ma Wanqi and Zeng Xianzhi, and more than 500 people from various sectors.

After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, State Vice Chairman Wang Zhen carefully viewed each exhibition room in the memorial hall and met with Ye's relatives and the donors who built the memorial hall, Xiong Delong, Yao Meiliang, Ye Zhenlin, Ye Guicai, Ye Fuju, Ye Shouren, and Qiu Fuxiong, as well as overseas and Hong Kong-Macao compatriots attending the ceremony.

Ye Jianying's cousin's wife, 91-year-old Zhang Shanshi, personally handed over Ye Jianying's graduation certificate from Yunnan Military Academy, which she had kept for 70 years, and the appointment order for the commander of the newly organized Second Division during the Northern Expedition to Vice Chairman Wang Zhen.
