The National Football First Division League has only one round left. The national second team, Liaoning, will compete for the championship.

Today, two matches of the National Football First Division League A Group were held in Hefei. The national second team drew 2-2 with the PLA team, while Liaoning defeated Guangzhou 1-0.

The results of this round of matches have confirmed that Guangzhou will be relegated to Group B. The upcoming match between the national second team and last year's champions, Liaoning, on October 26, will be the real championship contest of this year's First Division League. Currently, the national second team has 28 points and a goal difference of +18. Liaoning has 24 points, plus 4 points from contributing players to the national team, also totaling 28 points, but with a lower goal difference. In the final match, if they draw, the championship will go to the national second team. Liaoning must win to defend their title.

Today, the National Football First Division League (A Group) resumed in Nanjing. Tianjin defeated Guangdong 2-0, not only reversing their previous losses and avoiding relegation to Group B, but also having the opportunity to enter the top four.

Tianjin, despite being injured, fought aggressively. In the 13th and 30th minutes, forward Hu Jianting and center-back Chen Guozhong scored one goal each with a shot and a header.

In another match, Shandong, after taking the lead, conceded three goals and lost 1-3 to Shanghai, becoming the team most likely to be relegated to Group B.

　　全国足球甲级队联赛只剩一轮
　　国家二队辽宁队将争冠
    本报合肥10月24日电　今天在这里进行的两场全国足球甲级队联赛A组比赛，国家二队2∶2与八一队踢平，辽宁队1∶0战胜广州队。
    这一轮比赛的结果，使广州队降入B组成为定局。而去年全国冠亚军辽宁队与国家二队10月26日的交锋，成了今年甲级队联赛名副其实的冠军之争。目前，国家二队积28分，净胜球18个。辽宁队积24分，加上输送国家队员得到的“补贴”4分，也是28分，但净胜球不如国家二队。最后一战，如果战平，冠军便归国家二队。辽宁队只有取胜，才能卫冕。
    本报南京10月24日电　全国足球甲级队联赛（A组）今天在此再起硝烟。天津队2∶0力胜广东队，不仅挽狂澜于既倒，摆脱了降入B组的危险，而且出现了打进前四名的机缘。
    天津队此战在伤员累累的情况下全攻全守，第13分钟和第30分钟，前锋霍建廷和中卫陈国仲一脚一头各中一球。
    另一场比赛，山东队在领先情况下连失三球，以1∶3败给上海队，成为降入B组可能性最大的队。　（柴宴宾）
