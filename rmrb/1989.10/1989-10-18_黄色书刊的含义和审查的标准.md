	Question: Recently, we have started to confiscate yellow publications circulating among officers and soldiers in our unit, achieving some results. However, due to our lack of clarity regarding the definition and specific review standards of yellow publications, we find it difficult to distinguish between yellow and non-yellow publications in practical implementation. Could you please explain the meaning and review standards of yellow publications?

	Liaoning Hai Cheng City Garrison, Zhou Baozhong

	Answer: According to relevant regulations, yellow publications actually refer to obscene publications, pornographic publications, and publications that contain obscene or pornographic content. The scope of the ban on obscene publications is specified in Article 2 of the "Regulations of the State Council on the Strict Prohibition of Obscene Items" issued on April 17, 1985: "Publications that specifically describe sexual behavior or blatantly promote obscene and lascivious images." Article 3 states:

	"Artistic works with literary value that contain obscene content, artistic works that depict human beauty, works related to human physiology, medical knowledge, and other natural sciences, do not fall within the scope of obscene items and are not subject to prohibition."

	To implement the above regulations, the State Press and Publication Administration issued the "Provisional Regulations on the Identification of Obscene and Pornographic Publications" on December 27, 1988. Articles 2 and 3 of these regulations provide detailed standards for identifying obscene and pornographic publications. Publications that, while not obscene or pornographic, contain obscene or pornographic content, are vulgar, and harmful to minors should also be confiscated and destroyed.

	It is particularly important to note that the scope of confiscation should be limited to publications explicitly banned by the state; the methods and procedures for confiscation should be carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, and the military should also follow the relevant instructions of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army.

	Those involved in the production, sale, and dissemination of obscene publications should be dealt with according to law. According to the regulations of the State Council, those who smuggle, produce, sell, or organize the dissemination of obscene items, if the act constitutes a crime, shall be punished by the judicial authorities according to law; if the act does not constitute a crime, the competent authorities shall impose administrative sanctions based on the severity of the offense. Those who disseminate obscene items to minors under the age of 18, those who use their job positions to disseminate confiscated obscene items, and those who use their authority and managed equipment to reproduce or disseminate obscene items shall be severely punished according to law. Article 32, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Public Security Administration Punishments stipulates that those who produce, reproduce, sell, rent, or disseminate obscene books, obscene paintings, obscene videos, or other obscene items shall be detained for no more than 15 days and may be fined no more than 3,000 yuan or subjected to re-education through labor; if the act constitutes a crime, criminal liability shall be pursued according to law.

	Those who view, copy, or disseminate obscene books or paintings should be criticized and educated, and any physical items should be surrendered; those who repeatedly commit such acts should be subjected to administrative sanctions by the competent authorities.

    黄色书刊的含义和审查的标准
    问：最近，我们开始收缴流传在部队干部、战士中的黄色书刊，取得了一定效果。但是，由于我们对黄色书刊的内涵和具体的审查标准不很清楚，因而在具体实施过程中很难把握黄色书刊与非黄色书刊的界线。请问黄色书刊的含义和审查标准是什么？
    辽宁海城市驻军　周保中
    答：根据有关规定，黄色书刊实际上是指淫秽出版物、色情出版物和夹杂淫秽、色情内容的出版物。对淫秽出版物的查禁范围，1985年4月17日国务院《关于严禁淫秽物品的规定》第2条规定是：“具体描写性行为或露骨宣扬色情淫荡形象的”出版物。第3条规定：
  “夹杂淫秽内容的有艺术价值的文艺作品，表现人体美的美术作品，有关人体的生理、医学知识和其他自然科学作品，不属于淫秽物品的范围，不在查禁之列”。
    为实施上述规定，国家新闻出版署于1988年12月27日颁布了《关于认定淫秽及色情出版物的暂行规定》，其中第2条、第3条对淫秽、色情出版物的认定标准又作了详尽的规定。对虽不属淫秽、色情出版物，但夹杂淫秽色情内容，低级庸俗，有害青少年的也应收缴销毁。
    需要特别指出的是，收缴的范围应是国家明令查禁的书刊；收缴的方式、方法应按有关法规、文件规定的权限、程序进行，军队系统还应根据解放军总政治部的有关指示进行。
    对制作、贩卖、传播淫秽出版物的，应依法处理。根据国务院的规定，对于走私、制作、贩卖、组织传播淫秽物品，构成犯罪的，由司法机关依法惩处；未构成犯罪的，由主管部门根据情节轻重给予行政处分。对向不满18岁未成年人传播淫秽物品的，利用工作职务便利将没收的淫秽物品传播的，以及利用职权和所管理的设备复制或传播淫秽物品的，应依法从严惩处。治安管理处罚条例第32条第2款规定，制作、复制、出售、出租或者传播淫书、淫画、淫秽录像或者其他淫秽物品的，处15日以下拘留，可以单处或者并处3000元以下罚款；或者依照规定实行劳动教养；构成犯罪的，要依法追究刑事责任。
    对传看、传抄淫书、淫画的，应予以批评教育，有实物的应交出实物；对屡教屡犯的由主管部门给予行政处分。
