It was reported that the case of the stolen bronze dun from the Qu Yuan Memorial Hall in Zigui County, Hubei, was recently solved in Suizhou County, Hubei. The law is inexorable and leaves no room for escape. The criminals Li Jinfei and Wang Yuanqing, along with five others involved in the theft and smuggling of cultural relics, have been arrested according to law. Thus, the national treasure that had been lost for a year and traveled across the ocean finally returned to its rightful place on May 29th of this year.

The dun evolved from the ding and emerged in the mid-Spring and Autumn period, flourishing during the Warring States period, and gradually disappearing after the Qin Dynasty. As a novel food vessel, ancient people had the saying, "Use a plate to hold blood, and a dun to hold food." By the Song Dynasty, ancient bronze vessels with inward-curving mouths, lids, and two handles or square bases were called dun.

The dun is a vessel for holding millet and sorghum, which should be kept warm, hence it has a lid. The lid can be flipped over and used, turning one vessel into two. Initially, it had three legs, and a fire could be lit underneath. Later, it gradually evolved into having short legs and eventually no legs, becoming a mere container.

According to the commentary on the "Minor Offering Ritual" in the "Book of Rites," which quotes the "Commentary on the Classic of Filial Piety," it says: "The dun has a round top, and the top and bottom are connected in a circular shape." The characteristic of the dun is a round belly, three short legs, two loop handles, and a lid. The vessel and the lid are symmetrical, and when the lid is opened, it can be used in the same way as the vessel. The shape is mostly spherical, but there are also melon-shaped ones, commonly known as melon-shaped dun. There are also those without legs and only two loop handles, which ancient people called discarded dun. The discarded dun that has been passed down includes the Lord of Qi's dun, which is also known as the good dun because it was a wedding gift from the Lord of Qi. The commentary by Zheng Xuan on the "Ritual of Mourning for a Scholar" says: "The discarded dun is a dun without legs, used to hold rice." Among the discarded dun unearthed in Luoyang, Henan, there are remnants of grains.

In terms of decorative themes, the Warring States bronze dun gradually shed its religious mystique, making traditional animal patterns more abstract and transforming them into geometric patterns. The mythical animal images on bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasties were replaced by pure geometric patterns by the middle and late Warring States period. A Warring States period dun with inlaid triangular cloud patterns from the Shanghai Museum, standing at 25.4 centimeters tall, is adorned with fine silver and red copper wires woven into block and triangular cloud patterns, making it a rare and exquisite treasure.

The bronze dun from the Warring States period that was auctioned at Sotheby's in New York on November 29th of last year is 22.8 centimeters tall, spherical with three legs, two loop handles, and a beast's head in the middle. The legs are in the shape of coiled dragons, and the entire body is decorated with cloud patterns. The design is unique, and the craftsmanship is exquisite, forming a unified circular body with a distinct style. This bronze dun is relatively large. A pair of Warring States bronze dun that was lost to the United States in 1940 is 28.3 centimeters tall, with a mouth diameter of 20.6 centimeters and a width of 25.3 centimeters, which may be the largest Warring States bronze dun lost to the United States. Even the largest Warring States bronze dun in the largest museum in China, the Palace Museum in Beijing, is only 17.8 centimeters tall. This shows the rarity of the Warring States bronze dun that was lost to the United States.

    国宝归来话铜敦
    罗扬
    据报载，湖北秭归县屈原纪念馆战国铜敦失窃大案最近在湖北监利县破获。法网恢恢，疏而不漏。盗窃、盗运文物的罪犯栗金飞和王元清等七人已被依法逮捕。至此，流失一年飘洋过海的国宝，也于今年五月二十九日，终于从美国纽约“完璧归赵”。
    敦是从鼎演变而来的，产生于春秋中期，盛行于战国时代，秦朝以后逐渐消失。作为新颖食器，古人有“以盘盛血，以敦盛食”的说法。到了宋代，则把古铜器中敛口（即口向内收）、口有盖、两耳或有方座者称作敦。
    敦为盛黍稷之器，因黍稷宜温，所以有盖。盖能翻转过来使用，一器变为二器。最初有三足，下边可以烧火，后来渐成短足，以至无足，遂为盛器了。
    据《仪礼·少牢馈食礼》疏引《孝经纬》说：“敦，规首，上下圆相连。”敦的特征为圆腹、三短足、两环耳、有盖。器与盖上下对称，盖揭开后和器可同样使用。形状多为球形，也有西瓜形，俗称西瓜敦。更有无足只有两环耳的，古人称为废敦。废敦传世的有齐侯敦，因是齐侯嫁女之器也称善敦。《仪礼·士丧礼》郑玄注云：“废敦，敦无足者，所以盛米也”。在河南洛阳出土的废敦中就有残存的谷物。
    战国铜敦在装饰题材上，逐渐摆脱了宗教的神秘色彩，使传统的动物纹进一步抽象化，变化为几何纹。商、周时代青铜器上神话味浓重的动物图象，到了战国中后期已被纯几何纹饰所代替。上海博物馆收藏的一件战国中期镶嵌三角云纹敦，高二十五点四厘米，通体用细银丝和红铜丝盘嵌成块状和三角形的云纹，非常华丽，是不可多得的传世珍宝。
    去年十一月二十九日，在美国纽约索斯比拍卖行被拍卖的这件战国铜敦，高二十二点八厘米，球形三足，两环耳，中间有一兽头，足为虬龙状，通体均作云纹，造型新颖，花纹工丽，整个器体构成了一个圆的统一体，别具风格。这件铜敦算是比较大的。一九四○年流失到美国的一对战国铜敦，高二十八点三厘米，口径二十点六厘米，宽二十五点三厘米，可能要算是流失到美国的战国铜敦之最了。就连我国最大的博物馆——北京故宫博物院收藏的战国铜敦最大的也只有十七点八厘米。由此可见流失到美国的这件战国铜敦之珍贵了。
