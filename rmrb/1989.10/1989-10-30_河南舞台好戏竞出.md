Excellent plays are emerging on the Henan stage. As the obscene and violent "yellow poison" is being swept away, Henan's arts scene has been vibrant in recent years. A batch of plays and troupes that reflect the spirit of the times and are beloved by the people have been awarded by relevant departments in Henan Province.

A few years ago, amidst the "crisis" in drama, Henan Province presented plays such as "The Misfortune of Uncle's Marriage" and "The Fifteenth Moon" at the first drama competition, which have been performed for a long time and are well-received. The Yunchang City Yue Opera Troupe's production of "Dream of Stones" was the only modern play at the first Chinese Arts Festival and received praise. Recently, at the second Chinese Arts Festival (Central South) held in Guangzhou, the new modern play "Second-Class Citizen" performed by the three Henan Yue Opera troupes also won the favor of southern audiences.

Statistics show that since 1985, Henan Province has created an average of more than 200 new scripts per year, staged more than 60 new plays, performed more than 60,000 shows, and attracted more than 90 million viewers, of whom 80% are rural audiences, with a considerable proportion of young viewers.

　　河南舞台好戏竞出
    本报郑州电　记者李而亮报道：当那些淫秽凶杀的“黄毒”被清扫荡涤的时候，河南文艺舞台近年异彩纷呈。一批反映时代精神、深受人民群众喜爱的剧目和剧团，受到了河南省有关部门的嘉奖。
    几年前，在戏剧一片“危机”声中，河南省在第一届戏剧大赛上推出了《倒霉大叔的婚事》、《十五的月亮》等一批久演不衰的好戏。许昌市豫剧团排演的《石头梦》，作为第一届中国艺术节上唯一的一台现代戏而受到好评。最近，在广州举办的第二届中国艺术节上（中南），河南豫剧三团新排演的现代戏《二等公民》，也受到南国观众的喜爱。据统计，一九八五年以来，河南省平均每年创作出二百多个新剧本，排演出六十多个新剧目，演出六万多场，观众达九千多万人次，其中百分之八十是农村观众，青年观众也有相当的比例。
