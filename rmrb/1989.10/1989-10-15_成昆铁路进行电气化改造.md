The Chengkun Railway, known as a marvel of human conquest over nature, is set to undergo full-line electrification upgrades, with the goal of completion during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period. The relevant survey and design work is being handled by the Second Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, which recently announced this news in Chengdu.

The 1,100-kilometer-long Chengkun Railway runs through harsh climates, treacherous terrain, and complex geology. The total length of bridges and tunnels alone exceeds 400 kilometers. In recent years, with the development of China's economy, the transport capacity of the Chengkun Railway has become saturated, leading to the accumulation of goods and severe overcrowding in passenger trains. It is reported that after the electrification of the Chengkun Railway is completed, the overall transport capacity for both passengers and freight will be increased by more than onefold. The survey teams from the Second Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways have already arrived at the Chengkun line construction sites and are conducting surveys and designs.

    成昆铁路进行电气化改造
    据新华社成都10月13日电　（通讯员马有举）被视为人类征服自然奇迹的成昆铁路，将全线实行电气化技术改造，力争在“八五”计划期间建成。负责有关勘探设计的铁道部第二勘测设计院近日在成都宣布了这一消息。
    全长1100公里的成昆铁路沿线气候恶劣，地势险峻，地质复杂，仅桥梁、隧道的总长度就有400多公里。近年来，随着我国经济的发展，成昆铁路的运输能力饱和，沿线物资积压，旅客列车严重超员。据介绍，成昆铁路实现电气化通车后，全线客货运输能力将提高一倍以上，铁道部第二勘测设计院的勘测队目前已陆续到达成昆线工地，进行勘测设计。
