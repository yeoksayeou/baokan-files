Recently, the Public Security Bureau of Xiamen City, Fujian Province, cracked a case involving Taiwanese criminals infiltrating the mainland to smuggle guns to Taiwan. A batch of Taiwanese criminals who had infiltrated the mainland to engage in gun smuggling were captured, and a batch of smuggled guns and ammunition were seized.

In early September, the Xiamen Public Security Bureau received a tip about a man named Wu Dongyuan, a resident of Taiwan's Penghu, who was suspected of staying in Xiamen to engage in illegal gun smuggling. The bureau immediately organized an investigation. With the coordination of the provincial Public Security Bureau, cities such as Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou also quickly launched joint investigations.

So far, among the captured Taiwanese criminals, there is the ringleader of this case, Wu Wenxin, who was wanted by Taiwanese authorities and went by the alias Wu Dongyuan. There is also Chen Yuhong, who was captured after jumping from a building to escape during the gun exchange, and there are also criminals with multiple prior convictions in Taiwan, including the murderer Xu Guangsong, the assault offender Xu Pengyu, and the smuggler Gan Qingzhi. Among them, Wu Wenxin was captured by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau after fleeing to Shanghai.

The case is still under investigation.

Recently, the International Criminal Police Organization's Chinese National Central Bureau received information from the International Criminal Police Organization's General Secretariat regarding the criminals involved in this case, provided by Taiwanese authorities in September. The head of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security stated in a press conference on October 26 that they are willing to cooperate with Taiwanese authorities.
