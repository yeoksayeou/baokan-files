The mineral resources buried in the land of our motherland are an important material foundation for building the Four Modernizations and are the common wealth of all ethnic groups in China and our descendants. Protecting various mineral resources and fully and rationally developing and utilizing these mineral deposits are related to the immediate and long-term interests of the Chinese people.

In the 40 years since liberation, China has made tremendous achievements in the exploration, development, and protection of mineral resources. However, due to a period of emphasis on "quick flow of water" and "large mines are fully exploited, small mines are opened up," while neglecting the management and protection of resources, coupled with systemic issues and poor management, the order of mining production has become chaotic, and the phenomenon of disorderly mining is serious. Many places adopt the strategy of "large mines, small mines abandoned," "rich mines, poor mines abandoned," and "easy mines, difficult mines abandoned," which has caused shocking damage and waste of mineral resources. In particular, some township mines and individual miners engage in disorderly mining, disrupting the production of state-owned mines, looting mineral products, polluting the environment, and not paying attention to safety. The public is deeply dissatisfied with this and demands that strong measures be taken to rectify the situation as soon as possible.

The problem of low recovery rates in mining production has long existed, and most mines in China have not met the design requirements. In 1987, the average recovery rate of national coal mines was 50%, local coal mines were 30-40%, and individual mines were below 10%. China's 80% of ore deposits contain multiple useful components, and the value of these associated and symbiotic minerals is often several times or even tens of times higher than the main ore. However, our comprehensive utilization rate is quite low, and the phenomenon of "extracting the main ore and discarding the secondary ore," or even "extracting the secondary ore and discarding the main ore," is very common.

Currently, China's proven mineral reserves rank third in the world, with more than 200,000 ore deposits and ore points, and more than 160 types of minerals. It is one of the few countries in the world with a relatively complete set of minerals. In terms of total mineral resources, China is a resource-rich country, but the per capita resource ownership is less than half of the world average, ranking 80th in the world. Major minerals for steel, non-ferrous metals, and chemical industries, including iron, aluminum, manganese, zinc, etc., although the proven reserves can basically guarantee the needs of China's construction, due to various reasons, their production still cannot meet the needs of the country. Important mineral resources such as oil, natural gas, copper, and gold, although there is some potential, currently have a large gap in planned development and utilization. It is estimated that by the year 2000, the production capacity of 10% of China's existing iron mines will disappear, and the production capacity of lead and zinc mines will disappear by 40%. The main oil fields such as Daqing and 2/3 of the state-owned non-ferrous metal mines have long entered the middle and late stages of production.

In the long term, if there is no major breakthrough in prospecting work in the next few years, by the end of this century, the mineral resources needed for China's Four Modernizations will face a situation of overall tension. This is the reality of China's mineral resources.

Facing such a severe situation with China's mineral resources, many enlightened people strongly call for a new and practical understanding of the long-held concept of "vast territory and abundant resources." As a country with 1.1 billion people, the land is vast but the resources are not abundant. The urgent task is to start from China's mineral situation, seriously implement the "Mineral Resources Law," and truly regard "cherishing, rationally developing, and effectively protecting" as the basic national policy. It is necessary to widely publicize the situation of China's mineral resources among the people, arouse the sense of crisis among the people, and let everyone understand that mineral resources belong to the state, they are limited and non-renewable, and everyone should cherish the mineral resources of the motherland. Any behavior that is short-sighted, damages, and wastes the mineral resources of the motherland is unacceptable. All levels of competent departments must, in the spirit of being responsible to the state, the people, and future generations, take practical and effective measures to strengthen the protection and rational exploitation of mineral resources in accordance with the law. Those who violate the "Mineral Resources Law" and only consider local and immediate interests while damaging the national and long-term interests should be dealt with seriously in accordance with the law.

    珍惜祖国的矿产资源
    本报评论员
    蕴藏在祖国大地上的矿产资源，是我们建设四化的重要物质基础，也是我国各族人民和子孙后代的共同财富。保护各种矿产资源，充分地合理地开发和利用这些矿藏，关系到我国人民当前的利益和长远的利益。
    解放40年来，我国在矿产资源的勘查、开发和保护工作方面取得了巨大的成绩。但是，由于一个时期片面强调“有水快流”、“大矿大采，小矿放开”，而忽视管好、保护资源，再加上体制不顺，管理不善，致使矿业生产秩序混乱，乱采滥挖现象严重。不少地方采大弃小，采富弃贫，采易弃难，破坏和浪费矿产资源现象令人触目惊心。特别是一些乡镇矿业及个体采矿者，乱开乱采，干扰国营矿区生产，哄抢矿产品，污染环境，不重视安全等。社会各界对此深为不满，要求尽快采取强有力措施，予以整顿。
    矿业生产中回采率低的问题久已存在，我国大部分矿山未达到设计要求。1987年全国统配煤矿回采率平均为50％，地方煤矿为30—40％，个体矿为10％以下。我国80％的矿床伴生、共生多种有用成分，这些伴生、共生矿物的价值往往高于主矿几倍乃至几十倍。但我们的综合利用率却相当低，采主弃副，甚至采副弃主的现象极为普遍。
    现在，我国已探明的矿产储量居世界第三位，矿床、矿点20多万处，矿种160多个，是世界上矿种配套比较齐全的少数几个国家之一。从矿产资源总量上看，我国是世界上的资源大国，但人均资源拥有量却不及世界平均水平的一半，居世界第80位。钢铁、有色金属与化学工业部分大宗矿产，包括铁、铝、锰、锌等，虽然已探明的储量能基本保证我国建设所需，但由于种种原因，它们的产量还不能满足国家需要。石油、天然气、铜、金等重要矿产资源，虽有一定潜力，但目前可供规划开发利用的缺口很大。估计到2000年，我国现有铁矿山生产能力将消失10％，铅锌矿生产能力将消失40％。大庆等主力油田和2／3的有色金属统配矿山主金属生产早已到了中晚期。
    从长远看，今后若干年内找矿工作若无重大突破，到本世纪末，我国四化建设所需的矿产资源将出现全面紧张的局面。这就是我国矿产资源的“国情”。
    面对我国矿产资源如此严峻的形势，许多有识之士强烈呼吁，对长期以来深深印在人们头脑中“地大物博”的概念，现在应当有个新的、切合实际的再认识。作为一个拥有11亿人口的国家，地大而物并不博。当务之急是要从我国的矿情出发，认真贯彻落实《矿产资源法》，真正把“十分珍视、合理开发、有效保护”作为基本国策。要在全民中大力宣传我国的矿产资源形势，唤起国人的忧患意识，让人们都明白矿产资源属国家所有，它是有限的，不可再生的，人人都应十分珍惜祖国的矿产资源，任何急功近利、破坏和浪费祖国的矿产资源的行为，都是不能容许的。各级主管部门，一定要本着对国家负责，对人民负责，对子孙后代负责的精神，采取切实有效的措施，依法加强矿产资源的保护和合理开采。对那些违反《矿产资源法》只顾局部和眼前利益而损害国家利益、长远利益的，要依法给予严肃处理。
