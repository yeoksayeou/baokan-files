In the process of China's socialist modernization, to further deepen reforms and adhere to the policy of opening up, it is essential to have a stable social environment. Strengthening the Party's construction and rectifying its style of work are key factors in ensuring social stability.

How can we improve Party discipline and promote social stability to maintain a stable and united political situation? We believe that the following aspects should be emphasized in the current situation.

First, we must conduct in-depth Marxist theoretical education and scientific and cultural education for all Party members to fundamentally improve their ideological and moral qualities and scientific and cultural literacy. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the fundamental guiding ideologies of our Party. Only by persistently conducting Marxist education for the entire Party can we continuously improve the ideological and theoretical level of all Party members, enabling them to truly establish a dialectical materialist and historical materialist worldview and a life philosophy of striving for the distant goal of communism, cultivating excellent moral qualities of the proletariat. Only in this way can they remember in practice the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly, maintain and carry forward the Party's fine traditions and styles, and be good at using the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and methodology to answer and handle various problems in the cause of socialist revolution and construction, consciously resisting the infiltration of various non-proletarian ideologies and styles. When the ideological and moral qualities of all Party members are improved, it will fundamentally ensure that our Party can truly withstand the test of governance and reform and opening up under new historical conditions, thus leading the people of the whole country to complete the task of building a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern power as soon as possible. While conducting in-depth Marxist education for the entire Party, we must also seriously conduct scientific and cultural education. Because backward science and culture are also important factors affecting the improvement of Party discipline. It can be said that if Party members have low scientific and cultural literacy, this in itself will provide a breeding ground for improper practices. According to statistics, among the 47 million Party members, 78% have a junior high school education or below, and 8% are illiterate Party members. This situation needs to be reversed with great effort.

Second, we must establish and improve various supervision mechanisms and strengthen supervision over all Party members and cadres. At present, the seriousness of improper practices and corruption within the Party is largely due to the lack of effective supervision and restraint. Therefore, it is urgent that we quickly establish and improve various supervision mechanisms to form multi-channel supervision over all Party members, ensuring the success of the Party's cause from an institutional perspective. To this end, first, we must strengthen the construction of supervisory organs and disciplinary inspection commissions, granting these two institutions more effective actual power to truly exercise supervisory authority in practical work, while promoting intra-Party democracy and improving intra-Party democratic life institutions, enabling our Party to fully leverage organizational strength to effectively supervise Party members to consciously abide by the Party Constitution and Party discipline. Second, in society as a whole, we must use various forms and channels to place Party members under strict supervision by the masses. We must seriously listen to the opinions of the masses and encourage them to supervise the Party's work through various forms and channels, and evaluate Party members and cadres. Here, we must also pay special attention to the role of the media in public opinion supervision. Through this supervision, a powerful public opinion force can be formed to correct improper practices and corruption, ensuring that the Party's self-construction is better, and keeping the Party forever young and vigorous.

Third, we must strictly enforce Party discipline and adhere to the principle of strict governance. Those who corrupt the Party and the people's cause must be given disciplinary penalties according to the situation. Only in this way can we ensure the purity of the Party from an organizational perspective. A key issue in strict governance is to have stricter requirements for Party leaders. For Party members working in Party and government organs, especially those in major leadership positions, more stringent specific regulations should be formulated to ensure that leaders at all levels become models of observing the Constitution and laws, models of strictly observing Party rules and discipline, and models of strictly performing their duties in practical work. Those Party and government officials who are unqualified and those who violate laws and discipline should be dealt with according to the severity of their offenses.

Strict governance of the Party is a long-term task that should be carried out steadily as reform and opening up deepen. It must not be done in a half-hearted manner, sometimes tight and sometimes loose. Only by persevering can we build a better Party.

    加强党风建设  促进社会安定
    张振岩　陈海涛
    在我国社会主义现代化建设的过程中，要进一步深化改革和坚持对外开放，就必须有一个稳定的社会环境。加强党的建设，端正党风，是保证社会安定的诸多因素中的关键环节。
    怎样搞好党风建设，促进社会稳定，保持安定团结的政治局面呢？我们认为，在当前应着重抓好以下几个方面的工作。
    首先，要对全体党员深入进行马克思主义理论教育和科学文化教育，从根本上提高全体党员的思想道德素质和科学文化素质。马列主义、毛泽东思想是我们党的根本指导思想。只有坚持不懈地对全党进行马克思主义教育，才能不断提高全体党员的思想、理论水平，使他们真正确立辩证唯物主义、历史唯物主义的世界观和为共产主义远大理想而英勇奋斗的人生观，养成无产阶级的优良道德品质。这样，才能在实践中牢记全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，保持和发扬党的优良传统作风，并善于运用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法去回答和处理社会主义革命和建设事业中的各种问题，自觉抵制各种非无产阶级的思想和作风的侵蚀。全党同志的思想道德素质提高了，也就从根本上保证我们党在新的历史条件下真正能够经得起执政和改革开放的考验，从而带领全国人民早日完成建设富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化强国的任务。在对全党深入进行马克思主义教育的同时，还必须认真进行科学文化教育。因为科学文化的落后也是影响党风好转的重要原因。可以说，党员的科学文化素质差，这本身就会为不正之风的繁衍提供温床。据统计，在全党4700万党员中，初中文化程度以下的党员占了78％，其中文盲党员占8％，这种状况需要下大功夫加以扭转。
    其次，要建立、健全各种监督机制，加强对全体党员、干部的监督。目前党内不正之风、腐败现象之所以严重，缺乏有力的监督和制约不能不说是一个重要的原因。因此，迫切要求我们必须迅速建立、健全各种监督机制，形成对全体党员的多渠道的监督，从制度上保证党的事业的成功。为此，第一，要大力加强监察机关和纪律检查委员会的建设，赋予这两个机构更有效的实际权力，在实际工作中真正有效的行使监督权，同时发扬党内民主，健全党内民主生活制度，使我们的党能够充分发挥组织的力量，有效地监督自己的党员自觉地遵守党的章程和党的纪律。第二，在全社会，要通过各种形式和渠道使党员严格置于人民群众的监督之下。要认真听取人民群众的意见，鼓励群众通过各种形式和渠道监督党的工作，评议党员、干部。这里，还要特别注意发挥新闻媒介的舆论监督作用。通过这种监督形式，形成强大的舆论力量，以纠正不正之风和腐败现象，保证党的自身建设搞得更好，使党永葆其青春活力。
    再次，要严肃党的纪律，坚持从严治党。对于那些败坏党和人民事业的腐败分子，必须根据情况给以纪律处分。这样，才能从组织上保证党的纯洁性。从严治党的一个关键问题，在于对党的领导干部要有更加严格的要求。对在党政机关工作的党员，特别是担负主要领导工作的党员，均应制定更加严格的具体法规，使各级领导干部在工作实践中，都成为遵守宪法和法律的模范，严守党规党纪的模范，严格履行各自的工作职责的模范。对于那些不称职的党员干部和违法乱纪的党员干部，要视情节轻重作出处理。
    从严治党是一项长期性的工作，应随着改革开放的不断深入扎扎实实地做好，绝不能抓一抓、放一放，时紧时松。只有这样坚持不懈，才能把我们的党建设得更好。
