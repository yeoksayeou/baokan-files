Song Jin'an, a pharmacist from the pharmaceutical department of a hospital in the Nanjing Military Region, has adhered to principles and maintained integrity in his procurement of medicines. Recently, he was awarded the title of "Advanced Individual in Clean and Upright Conduct" by the Nanjing Military Region, and the hospital's party committee awarded him a third-class merit citation.

Since taking on the role of medicine procurement officer at the end of 1987, the 26-year-old Song Jin'an has set three rules for himself: do not accept invitations, do not accept gifts, and do not use his position for personal gain. In September 1988, Song Jin'an signed a supply contract with a pharmaceutical factory. However, the factory unilaterally raised the price of the medicines upon delivery and issued an invoice at the higher price. The factory's sales representative privately handed Song Jin'an 300 yuan, asking him to overlook the price increase. Song Jin'an said, "If I turn a blind eye, my own pocket might get a bit fuller, but the hospital would lose over 1,000 yuan. I can't do that." He returned the money to the sales representative and accepted the goods at the original price. On another occasion, a sales representative from a pharmaceutical factory, while discussing a business deal with Song Jin'an, said, "If you can give us some leeway on the medicine prices, we can guarantee you a JinXing-brand color TV worth 1,500 yuan, with more rewards to come." Song Jin'an replied, "Even if you gave me a golden child, I would never do anything harmful to the national interest!" He firmly rejected the offer.

Within his unit, Song Jin'an conducts business dealings uprightly and honestly. When on official trips, he maintains the same strict standards. Once, he was invited to Guangzhou to attend a procurement meeting. At the end of the meeting, the organizing unit gave each representative 100 yuan to visit Shenzhen. Song Jin'an had never been to Shenzhen and was eager to experience the special economic zone's scenery. However, he felt that using state funds to travel and sightsee would tarnish the image of a Communist Party member, so he gave up the opportunity and returned the 100 yuan to the hospital upon his return. For invitations from other units to attend procurement meetings, he would try to handle the procurement through letters, telegrams, or phone calls whenever possible, saving the hospital a considerable amount of expenses.

    “决不干损害国家利益的事”
    ——记南京军区某医院药士宋进安
    南京军区某医院药材科药士宋进安，在采购药品活动中坚持原则，廉洁奉公，最近被南京军区授予清正廉洁先进个人的称号，医院党委给他记三等功一次。
    今年26岁的宋进安1987年底担任药品采购员后，针对社会上盛行的“回扣”风，给自己约法三章：不吃请，不收礼，不利用工作之便捞取好处。1988年9月，宋进安与一家药厂签订了一份供货合同，但厂方供货时擅自提高药品价格，并开出了发票。该厂推销员私下塞给宋进安300元钱，请他高抬贵手。宋进安说：“我的手一抬，自己的腰包可能会鼓一些，但医院却要损失1000余元，这个手我不能抬。”他将钱如数退给那位推销员，按原价格收了货。还有一次，某药厂推销员在与宋进安洽谈一笔生意时说：“只要你在药品价格上多多关照，保准1500元给你弄一台金星牌彩电，日后还有酬谢。”宋进安说：
  “你就是给我一个金娃娃，我也决不干损害国家利益的事！”他严正拒绝了对方的要求。
    宋进安在本单位谈业务坐得正，行得端，出差在外也同样严格要求。一次，他应邀到广州参加一个订货会，会议结束时，主办单位给每位代表发了100元钱，让大家到深圳玩一玩。宋进安从未去过深圳，很想领略一下特区风光。但他又觉得慷国家之慨游山玩水，有损于共产党员的形象，便放弃了这次机会，返回后主动将100元钱交给了医院。对于外单位邀请参加订货会，凡是能用信函、电报、电话订货的，他尽量做到不参加会议，为医院节省了不少开支。
