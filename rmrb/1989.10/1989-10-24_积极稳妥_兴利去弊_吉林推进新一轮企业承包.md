By the end of this year, 60% of enterprises in Jilin Province will have completed their contracting periods. The province has decided to follow the principle of "not flipping the pancake" and to promote a new round of enterprise contracting in a positive and prudent manner, eliminating harm and promoting benefits.

Jilin Province was the first to implement the enterprise contracting system in 1982, achieving significant results. Over the seven years from 1982 to 1988, the province's budgetary industrial enterprises saw their realized profits and taxes, paid profits and taxes, and fiscal revenues increase by 3.4 times, 2 times, and 2.4 times respectively. The development momentum of the enterprises has also been greatly enhanced.

This year, the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have summed up the experiences and lessons of the past few years of implementing the contracting system in a realistic manner. They have decided to focus on the continuity of the contracting period in the new round of enterprise contracting. For large key enterprises and those undergoing key technological transformations, the contracting agreements will be extended with minor adjustments to individual clauses. For enterprises with better management quality and those requiring significant adjustments to the contracting content, the contractors will remain unchanged, and new contracting agreements will be signed. For a small number of enterprises with unpredictable development, a rolling contracting method will be adopted, with periodic assessments, audits, and settlements.

After investigating more than a hundred enterprises, Jilin Province has formulated an implementation plan that clearly proposes the key tasks for the new round of enterprise contracting: adopting five methods—average benefit method, base rolling method, competitive bidding method, proportional calculation method, and differential interest rate contracting—to reasonably determine the contracting base; strictly regulating the enterprise retention method, stipulating that at least 70% of the contracted profit share should be used for production development and technological transformation; implementing a "chain" linkage between the total wage bill and realized (or paid) profits and taxes, per capita labor productivity, capital profit and tax rate, and asset appreciation rate, ensuring reasonable growth of enterprise wages; implementing a "double linkage" between the personal income of managers and the economic benefits of the enterprise and the income of employees, with the annual income of managers not exceeding three times the average annual income of the enterprise's employees; gradually promoting the full-employee asset contracting system, where enterprise employees contract the state-owned assets, and then the entire workforce hires managers. Employees have the right to impeach and dismiss managers, and democratic evaluation of managers, public distribution of managers and employees, employee reporting, and official recusal should be universally implemented to establish a community of interests between managers and producers; strengthening the supervision of the party organization within the enterprise and in legal, democratic, and auditing aspects, rectifying and standardizing enterprise behavior, and appropriately increasing the amount of the full-employee and position responsibility risk deposit to enhance the overall loss-bearing capacity.

Currently, Jilin Province has fully launched the work of promoting the new round of enterprise contracting. More than 20% of enterprises in the province have signed "mutual guarantee contracts" with managers and employee representatives. The work of democratic evaluation of managers is also being carried out in cities such as Jilin, Siping, and Tonghua.

### 积极稳妥　兴利去弊  吉林推进新一轮企业承包

　　积极稳妥　兴利去弊
　　吉林推进新一轮企业承包
    新华社长春10月23日电　（记者高欣）今年底将有60％的企业承包到期的吉林省，决定按照不翻“烧饼”，兴利去弊的原则，积极稳妥地推进新一轮企业承包。
    吉林省1982年率先推行企业承包制，取得明显成效，到1988年的7年间，全省预算内工业企业实现利税、上缴利税和财政收入分别增长3.4倍、2倍和2.4倍，企业的发展后劲也大为增强。
    今年，吉林省委、省政府实事求是地总结了前几年推行承包制的经验和教训，确定在新的一轮企业承包中切实抓好承包期的接续。对大型骨干企业和重点技术改造企业，承包合同除个别条款调整外，顺延承包期；对经营者素质较好、承包内容需作较大调整的企业，宣布承包者不变，重新签订承包合同；对少数发展难以预测的企业，采取不定期承包，定期考核、审计、兑现的滚动承包办法。
    吉林省在对上百家企业调查研究后制定的实施方案明确提出了新一轮企业承包的工作重点：采取效益平均法、基数滚动法、竞争招标法、比例计算法和差额利率承包法等5种方式来合理确定承包基数；严格企业留成办法，规定承包分成利润要有70％以上用于生产发展和技术改造；实行工资总额与实现（或上缴）利税、全员劳动生产率、资金利税率、资产增值率等指标“连环”挂钩，保证企业工资合理增长；实行经营者个人收入与企业经济效益、职工收入“双挂钩”，经营者年收入最高为本企业职工年均收入的3倍；逐步推行全员资产承包制，由企业职工承包国有资产，再由全体职工招聘经营者，职工有权弹劾、罢免经营者，普遍实行经营者民主测评、经营者和职工分配公开以及职工举报、干部回避等制度，建立经营者与生产者利益共同体；强化企业内部党组织的监督和法规、民主、审计等方面的监督，端正和规范企业行为，并适当加大全员和岗位责任风险抵押金额，增强整体负亏能力。
    目前，吉林省推进新一轮企业承包工作已经全面展开，全省有20％以上的企业签订了经营者与职工代表大会的“互保合同”，民主测评经营者工作也正在吉林、四平、通化等市铺开。
