Qatar Football Team Draws with South Korea

According to Xinhua News Agency in Singapore on October 13th, the new force from the Middle East, the Qatar team, achieved their goal tonight at the Singapore National Stadium, drawing 0-0 with the strong contender, South Korea.

This was the final match of the first round of the 1990 World Cup Asian qualifying finals. South Korea did not play particularly well in tonight's match, but Qatar's tactics were successful. After the kickoff, South Korea took the offensive. Qatar's defense was excellent, with seven or eight players often blocking in front of the goal. In the 20th minute of the first half, South Korea's number 17, Gu Xiangfan, shot powerfully from 25 meters in front of the goal, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. In the second half, although South Korea substituted Choi Chunhao to direct the midfield, their attacks were repeatedly thwarted, and the offensive efforts of both teams were roughly equal, with each team shooting three times. Thus, the first round ended, and China's team temporarily topped the standings.

    卡塔尔足球队逼和南朝鲜队
    据新华社新加坡10月13日电　（记者张千里、李永明）西亚新军卡塔尔队今晚在新加坡国家体育场如愿以偿，0∶0逼平出线热门南朝鲜队。
    这是1990年世界杯足球赛亚洲区预选赛决赛第一轮的最后一场比赛。南朝鲜队在今晚的比赛中踢得并不十分出色，卡塔尔队的战术却获得了成功。开球后，南朝鲜队攻势占了上风。卡塔尔队防守很出色，门前常有七八名队员封堵。上半时第20分钟，南朝鲜队17号具相范在对方球门正面25米处劲射，球中门楣弹出。下半时，南朝鲜队虽然换上崔淳镐在中场指挥，但进攻屡屡受阻，两队的攻势竟大体相同，射门各3次。至此，第一轮赛毕，中国队积分暂列榜首。
