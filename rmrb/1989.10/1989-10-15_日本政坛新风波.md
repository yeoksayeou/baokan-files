    New Turmoil in Japan's Political Scene
    By Yu Qing, Our Correspondent

    The Japanese political scene, which had been relatively quiet for some time, has once again been stirred by a scandal involving the "pachinko" industry's political donations to politicians. According to materials disclosed by Japanese media, from 1984 to 1988, over a hundred politicians accepted more than 1.5 billion yen in political donations from the "All-Japan Amusement Industry Association" (referred to as "Zenren"), causing a sensation in Japanese society.

    Pachinko is a form of entertainment where players use electric pinball machines to win balls, which can then be exchanged for various items or even money. This disguised form of gambling generates approximately 20 trillion yen annually, making it one of the industries with the highest tax contributions and also one of the industries with the most tax evasion.

    The scandal began in August when "Bungei Shunju" magazine published an article revealing that a Social Democratic Party lawmaker had received large political donations from the pachinko industry. Following this lead, various media outlets conducted extensive investigations, causing a stir. Notably, among the more than a hundred lawmakers involved, there were also five current and former Japanese prime ministers.

    Since the scandal initially affected Social Democratic Party members who had won big in the recent House of Councillors election, the Liberal Democratic Party, which was in a difficult position, saw an opportunity to exploit the situation. They expressed their intention to thoroughly investigate the matter and were eager to use it as a pretext to attack the Social Democratic Party during the current extraordinary session of the Diet. However, as the media's investigations progressed, it was discovered that the political donations amounted to hundreds of millions of yen flowing into the Liberal Democratic Party. Most of the lawmakers who received these donations were from the Liberal Democratic Party. Liberal Democratic Party members then stated that as long as the donations did not violate the Political Funds Control Law, there was no problem.

    Political donations are an important source of funding for Diet members. Japan's Political Funds Control Law stipulates that organizations and individuals must report the amount of donations to relevant government departments, and there are also limits on the amount of each donation. However, donors and recipients often collude, either by breaking down large donations into smaller amounts or by secretly transferring funds, making it difficult to find any discrepancies in the donation amounts. The key issue is whether the donors have any special intentions and whether the recipients use their power to act in the donors' interests. The suspicion in this scandal is that during the 1984 Diet discussions on amending the "Public Morals Ordinance" and since the beginning of last year when the industry started implementing the credit card system, the industry used political donations to bribe lawmakers to prevent the amendments and implementation. If it is found that lawmakers who received political donations have abused their power, they will be guilty of bribery.

    Regarding this suspected bribery case, government officials have stated that if any illegal activities are found, they will be dealt with seriously. It is reported that both the Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties have formed special teams to investigate the case and will gradually release the investigation results. This case has already attracted the attention of the prosecution authorities.

    Following the Liquorate scandal, the pachinko case has once again sparked public discontent over the intertwining of money and power in politics. As the situation develops, this case may become a focal point of contention in the current Diet session, potentially affecting the political dynamics of the various parties in the upcoming House of Representatives election.

    日本政坛新风波
    本报记者　于青
    一个时期以来稍显沉静的日本政坛，近日又因一桩“弹子房”行业向政界人士提供政治捐款问题掀起新的风波。据日本报刊披露的材料，自1984年至1988年，超过百名政界人士接受了弹子房行业的联谊团体“全国游技业行业联合会”（简称“全游联”）的1.5亿日元以上的政治捐款，在日本社会引起轰动。
    弹子游戏是一种用电动打弹机赢弹子的游艺，顾客在游艺中玩赢了就能换取各种物品，还可偷偷地换钱。这种变相赌博的弹子游艺，每年流动的资金约有20万亿日元之巨，该行业每年上缴给国家不少税金，同时又是偷税漏税最多的行业。
    事情发端于今年8月份，《文春周刊》杂志在一篇报道中首先披露了社会党议员接受过“弹子房”行业大笔政治捐款的问题，以此为线索，各种传播媒介竞相追踪，闹得满城风雨。尤其令人注目的是上百名国会议员中，还包括现任和前任的5位日本首相。
    由于此事先是波及此次参院选举中获大胜的社会党人士，处于逆境中的自民党见有机可乘，便表示要彻底追查，并跃跃欲试在本届临时国会中以此向社会党发难。但随着新闻界的追查不断进展，发现政治捐款中的上亿日元是流向自民党，接受这笔政治捐款的议员中，大多数是自民党议员。自民党人士遂又表示，只要不是违反有关政治资金捐款法，就没有任何问题。
    政治捐款是国会议员的重要活动资金来源，日本《政治资金限制法》规定，捐款团体和个人必须向政府有关部门申报捐款数额，而且对每次捐款数额也有限制。但一些捐款人和受款人总是配合默契，或化整为零，或暗渡陈仓，从捐款数额上难以找出破绽。问题在于捐款人是否有特别用意和受款人是否行使权力，做有利于捐款人的事。这次风波的疑点是，1984年国会讨论修改《风俗营业法》期间，以及去年开始准备在该行业实施信用卡制度以来，该行业为阻止修改和实施，有用政治捐款在议员中收买代言人的嫌疑。通过追查，如发现得到政治捐款的议员确有以权谋私的行为，将构成行贿受贿罪。
    对于这一涉嫌贿赂案，政府人士表示，如发现确有违法行为，将严肃处理。据悉，自民党和在野党各党都已组成专门班子调查此案，并将陆续披露调查结果。此案已引起检察当局的关注。
    利库路特丑闻一波未平，弹子房案一波又起，金钱权力合一的政治再次激起人们的不满。随着事态的进展，此案可能成为困扰本届国会的焦点之一，进而对各党在未来众院大选中政治力量的消长也将产生影响。　（本报东京10月12日电）
