It was the month of May, when flowers are in full bloom, and I had the fortune to visit the banks of the Qinhuai River, where the poet Wang Changling once served as a county magistrate. What a wonderful place! The sky is so clear, and the breeze is so intoxicating.

“If friends in Luoyang ask, tell them my heart is pure as ice in a jade vase.”
“In the county, there is good governance, and no one disputes the words.”

Every time I stroll through this land of six dynasties and ten ancient capitals, the memories of that “Saint of Seven-Character Quatrains,” Wang Changling, whose poems are filled with integrity and elegance, and whose name is praised by the common people, still linger in my ears.

Or perhaps this historic city, which has endured countless changes, still preserves the ancient customs? Or perhaps there is something about my “travels” that has piqued the curiosity of many passersby?

“You must have come to this remote countryside to achieve a two-fold increase ten years ahead of schedule, right?”
“You came to this land of ancient rivers and mist, do you know how many ‘Wang Changlings’ there are in Jiangning?”

It was the praise from the common people that led me into a new gallery of characters, where I met a “Wang Changling” who embodies the spirit of the times.

### Roadside Anecdotes

In the early morning, I walked towards the distant horizon, where the sky was painted with a vibrant red, through the quiet streets, heading to the riverside to exercise. As I passed by the county government building, a young and elegant sanitation worker paused her broom, smiling as she greeted me. She had obviously been paying attention to me and knew a bit about me. Her smile hid a riddle, asking if I recognized the woman behind her.

Behind her was a middle-aged woman, not very tall, wearing a mask and cap that had turned gray from dust. She held a large broom and a trash cart, skillfully sweeping and collecting trash. When I looked closely, the young sanitation worker's eyes shone with pride as she whispered to me: That is the elder sister of our current county magistrate, named Chen Guixiang; she has been working with the broom and trash cart for several years.

I don't know if it was my misunderstanding or if I had a pessimistic view of the world, but I found it hard to believe such a “roadside anecdote.” Only after carefully examining the features of this Chen Guixiang and comparing them repeatedly with the current county magistrate Chen Dafa, did I dispel my doubts and open my “eyes and ears.”

That year, Chen Guixiang followed her husband back to the county from the Northeast, already in her early forties. Regarding job assignments, Dafa had a condition: The county still has many unemployed youth who haven't been placed, so if Guixiang can't get a job, it's fine. If she wants to work, let her find a place where no one else wants to work and do it for a few years. It just so happened that the county was setting up a sanitation department, and he immediately decided to support his sister in becoming a street sweeper.

Sweeping streets was nothing extraordinary for Chen Guixiang, who had been a worker for many years. However, in such a special environment, she had an extra burden on her mind. Therefore, for a long time, she always avoided the county government building, only sweeping the eastern section of the street. Dafa noticed this and found his sister. Indeed, she was afraid of sweeping in front of her brother's county government building, fearing it would bring shame to him and that people would gossip about him.

“Hey! Why be afraid? This won't bring any shame to me! I am the county magistrate, and you are a street sweeper, both are honorable! You just go over there and sweep, sweep all the way to the government building, what's wrong with that? Good!…” Dafa spoke frankly and openly.

Chen Guixiang's heart was put at ease. Every morning, she would sweep the streets with her large broom, from the government building to the crossroads, covering the entire street.

This might seem lacking in human touch, in sibling affection. In fact, County Magistrate Chen Dafa highly respects his only elder sister. He also would not forget his sister's kindness. After their father passed away when they were young, it was their elder sister who helped their mother support the poor family.

In the most difficult times, it was their sister who, to support him in his studies, left home and went to the Northeast. Finally, he stood before his sister and spoke a simple yet profound truth:

“What the Chinese people are most dissatisfied with us officials is our lack of self-awareness and self-righteousness. We cannot be indifferent…”

Just as this matter was not yet resolved, another incident arose. Chen Guixiang's son, Chen Dafa's nephew Feng Wei, was tired of being a repairman at the fertilizer factory. Unable to find a way out, he resorted to a desperate move. Taking advantage of Chen Dafa's absence on a business trip for a few days, he quietly completed the transfer procedures and switched to a position as a supply clerk at a certain company. His psychology of hoping for luck was not difficult to understand:

This kind of thing, once done, is a fait accompli, known to everyone. As long as you close one eye, it will be “out of sight, out of mind.”

However, who would have thought that County Magistrate Chen Dafa's information was so timely? The day after he returned to the county, he called Feng Wei, shouting, “Lawless!” Followed by an ultimatum: “Immediately return to your original position as a repairman, otherwise, I will notify both sides to stop paying your salary!”

There were rumors that because of these consecutive “heartless” incidents, Chen Guixiang was so angry that she once scolded her county magistrate brother on the street with her broom. But when I asked her directly, she denied it completely, and she seemed to have suffered a great injustice, making her so upset that she didn't know what to say.

“If you have time, go see Chen Zi, and you won't need to ask about this anymore.”

### Chen Zi, Who Is She?

Chen Zi is the county magistrate's wife. She works at the Labor Service Company. On the morning I went to the company's office building, she was sweating, holding a large mop, mopping the long marble floor.

She was a janitor. This position sounded unfamiliar at first, but after sitting in her small room where she boiled water, listening to her list her duties—sweeping, boiling water, emptying spittoons, flushing toilets, delivering mail, fetching newspapers—like reciting a family history, I finally understood. It was like a soldier's orderly and communications officer. It is said that she has been diligently and conscientiously performing her duties on this post for four or five years.

“Do you find this job suitable?”
“It's suitable. What's the difference in any job?”

“How much is your monthly income here, including bonuses and other things?”

“There are no bonuses here. Including everything, it was around 70 yuan until last year, and this year it's about 100.”

I am not a materialist. I asked this because it reminded me of other related incidents. People told me that over the years, some of Chen Dafa's colleagues, friends, superiors, and subordinates had tried to find various ways to arrange a more lucrative job for Chen Zi, to increase her income and improve the family's financial situation. Chen Dafa, without asking about the reasons or motives, replied with the same words: “Don't bother with this. She has a low level of education, this job is suitable for her. We can't force her into another position, making her eat a meal of favors and take dishonest money. If you use your power to get your wife and children more benefits and transfer jobs, what else can this be called besides using power for personal gain?!”

From the praise of the common people, I learned that Chen Dafa's elderly mother is still alive, and he has two sons still in school. The couple's combined monthly income of over 200 yuan supports a family of five, living a very difficult and frugal life. For many years, it has always been green vegetables and radishes on the table, with only one meat dish per week for the whole family to enjoy. Before winter, Chen Zi would buy a hundred or two hundred pounds of radishes, pickle them into radish chips, and the whole family would eat them until the next season's vegetables and radishes came in. The wife saw that Chen Dafa's hair was turning white at a young age, and out of pity, she saved money every day to boil two eggs for him. Chen Dafa would give them to his mother, and his mother would give them to her grandchildren, and none would end up in his mouth.

The eldest son is now in high school. The distance is far, and everyone else rides a bicycle, but he doesn't have one, so he has to sit on the back of a classmate's bicycle every day. The old mother had mentioned this to Chen Dafa many times, but he never took it seriously: “Kids running a bit is nothing. Don't spoil him!” If it weren't for that time when he fell off the back of someone's bicycle and got injured, needing so many stitches, he might still not be able to imagine riding a bicycle. It's hard to believe, but the head of a county, until August 31, 1988, the only modern appliance in his family was a 14-inch black-and-white television. In the second half of the year, it was said that color TVs would increase in price, and the children's voices grew louder every day. The couple had no choice but to borrow some money and buy an 18-inch color TV, taking a step towards modernizing the family. The price paid for this was: the family dinner table, which had just broken through the level of one meat dish per week, fell back to the starting line; half a year's worth of deductions from the paycheck, and now it's still in debt.

One evening, I came to this county magistrate's residence with a common person's confusion. He was not there, and his wife Chen Zi and his elderly mother received me. After sitting down, while they were preparing tea, I casually looked over this ordinary residential room in an ordinary residential building for workers: worn-out old-style sofas, worn-out furniture that perfectly matched the hard life... Poverty was written on every piece of furniture in this family. Facing all this, I thought of this county magistrate's governance of Jiangning County. There are sufficient resources and evidence to prove that since 1984, that is, during his and the county's Party Secretary Chen Zonglin's term, the county's total production value has been rising by about 30% every year; it has already achieved a two-fold increase in this year, 11 years ahead of schedule. The net income of every ordinary farmer in the county has also doubled without any reduction. I was momentarily unbalanced, and I couldn't help but think deeply, thinking of the current fashion, the current taboo of “horizontal” and “vertical.” I was thinking, if this seven-grade county magistrate changed his attitude, changed his morality and values, what would it be like?

However, there is a chasm, a fortress, a natural barrier at Lazi Pass.

### The Fortress of Morality

The ancients said: “Living in poverty in the city, no one recognizes you; living in wealth in the mountains, you have distant relatives.” Some people say: Now, if you change the word “rich” to “power,” it is also appropriate.

The position of a seven-grade official is not necessarily glorious, but those who come to knock on the door and sit on the sofa can be said to be countless.

Two years ago, on a certain evening, an elderly woman over sixty years old walked into this door, her gaze wandering as she looked up and down at County Magistrate Chen Dafa.

“County Magistrate... do you still recognize me?”

Chen Dafa looked and immediately stood up respectfully, calling her “Aunt Wei” affectionately. He went forward to support the old woman, respectfully serving tea and inquiring about her health.

Soon after, on another evening, the old woman brought her only daughter and entered this door for the second time. The title of county magistrate changed to the familiar name “Dafa.” With a voice already choked with tears, she said, “Dafa, Aunt Wei misunderstood you.”

Time had flowed away for twenty years. At that time, Chen Dafa was still a poor student suffering from an acute illness in the county hospital. That was the turbulent year of the Cultural Revolution, and it happened to be the busy farming season. His widowed mother in the countryside could not come to the city to take care of him. He was rolling on the bed in pain, but no doctor or nurse would respond. Just as he was in dire straits, a “mother” he had never met before came to his bedside, silently boiling soup and medicine for him, washing his clothes, sending him meals, guarding him day and night, taking care of him. Who remembers how many times that mother's hand gently wiped away the cold sweat from his forehead? Who knows what that piece of maternal love, bestowed upon you, is made of? Blood? Liver? Or... At first, he only knew to follow others in calling her Aunt Wei. It was only before he was discharged from the hospital that he knew she was an extremely ordinary janitor.

Now, the old woman is old and sick, retired and returned home. Hearing that the Dafa of that time had become a county magistrate, she dared not hesitate to find him. Naturally, a pair of muddy eyes stared at County Magistrate Chen Dafa for a long time before she spoke in a dull voice about her request: Her husband, who had eaten chalk dust all his life, had already passed away, leaving only her and her daughter to depend on each other. This year, her daughter, who studied medicine, would graduate, and she hoped to arrange her nearby, so she could take care of her.

Having lived in simplicity for a long time, knowing many hardships. This Chen Dafa, who has always despised any “backdoor” practices, surprisingly agreed: “Aunt Wei, your request is reasonable, you can go back and rest assured, I will definitely help you with this.” It was this Aunt Wei who, after her daughter was indeed assigned to work in a nearby hospital, actually borrowed money to buy a large package of gifts, bringing her daughter to Chen Dafa's doorstep.

People, our people!

Can you blame her? When the matter was not yet settled, many kind-hearted people's words had already filled her ears:

“Now, doing things is different from before, you can't be so stubborn!”
“Yesterday is yesterday, becoming an official changes everything, having power means being greedy.”

Everyone said so, and her own daughter also said so.

She finally believed it, accepted it. But when that evening, County Magistrate Chen Dafa, as if something big had happened, brought the package, walked through the streets and alleys, and returned it to her in its original condition, the old woman was confused and doubtful again. He naturally would not accept it.

“Aunt Wei, don't be confused. I don't care what position I hold, I am still that Dafa, still an ordinary person, with the same conscience and feelings as an ordinary person. Your daughter is a doctor for everyone, and I am a county magistrate for everyone, it's the same thing.” Behind that was a harsh sentence, “You doing this, isn't it treating us as corrupt officials?”

Chen Dafa had even thought of a solution: The nutritional supplements the old woman could keep for herself to supplement her body, and the other valuable items he would help return, and if the money was not enough, he would make up the difference.

When the old woman finally understood, she was filled with remorse and tears. That sentence, which sounded ordinary but was heart-rending, was indeed spoken from the heart with tears.

“Aunt Wei misunderstood you!…”

The ancients had a saying, “Officials do not hit those who bring gifts,” but this Chen Dafa is a role that goes against “sentiment” and “reason.” It seems that sending a few cigarettes, a few bottles of wine, a few packs of trinkets, might not be worth much. However, once this fortress of morality is breached, its depths are the entire country, the entire nation! Therefore, having more Chen Dafas who wield sticks is a need of the times, a blessing for the people.

### Son of the Earth

Chen Dafa came; he came to chat with me about the joys and sorrows of reform.

This 42-year-old county magistrate is only about 1.65 meters tall, quick-witted, quick-tongued, wise and experienced, full of youthful vigor. He doesn't look like a county magistrate, doesn't look like a government official. He reminds me of a barefoot doctor, a teacher, a technical expert from an agricultural machinery station; he graduated from an agricultural college with a bachelor's degree, a knowledgeable and pioneering county magistrate. He has a strong sense of the common people, a weak sense of officialdom, and a wide range of interests. Economics, ecology, genetic engineering, behavioral science, novel selections, reportage literature, he likes everything, picks it up and reads it, digs into it (fortunately, he remembers the characters and plots of a few of my works from 20 years ago so clearly). When he works, he throws himself into it with all his might, and when he plays, he swims, plays ball, runs marathons, and mixes with the common people.

This made me think of his recent self-reflection at some meeting: “No matter what model the county magistrate is, we must first admit my character, allow my character to exist...” It is said that when he said these words at that time, many people found it strange, surprised, and even stunned. I, however, found it refreshing and novel.

What kind of character is he? Which aspects of his character need to be allowed to exist? I asked a person from the county government who is familiar with County Magistrate Chen Dafa. This comrade has some literary talent and provided me with a character and image carrier.

Just last month, County Magistrate Chen Dafa wore his usual worn-out, low-grade suit, took the morning bus to the countryside. After getting off the bus, he walked another twenty miles, visiting villages and fields, talking to farmers. What was the matter? Not long ago, the county held a meeting to deploy agricultural production and formulated several specific measures for developing agriculture. He wanted to directly find the farmers working in the fields to see if those measures had been implemented? Did the farmers receive the allocated fertilizer and diesel on time and in full? Was there confidence in achieving a bumper harvest this year? What other requests do the farmers have for the government? After a day of running around, he visited three townships and four administrative villages. The situation was good, everything was implemented well, and the farmers were happy. He also put his mind at ease. However, before the sun set, when he came to a certain village, he was surrounded by a few farmers who told him their troubles. They said their village was not doing well, they had no heart to work in the fields, and a bumper harvest was just talk. Digging deeper, it turned out that the problem was with the village (administrative village) secretary, who had embezzled 150,000 yuan from the village-run enterprise to buy a car, only caring about making money by running transportation, and who had the heart to manage agriculture? Chen Dafa carefully checked the facts and that evening rushed to the township government to find the township leaders. He immediately asked, “Ask him if he still wants to be a Communist Party member? Tell him, he has two choices: immediately return the money and make a self-criticism; remove his position and force him to return the money!”

Good, a vivid Chen Dafa!

We chatted until noon. It was time to eat, and he generously waved his hand: “Come, I'll treat you to a meal.” I thought he was taking the opportunity to discuss business and invite me to a feast. Walking into the small dining room of the guesthouse, I was surprised. It was still the place where I usually eat, and there were no drinks or any of the trendy items like napkins and wine glasses on the table. It was still my usual two meats, two vegetables, and one soup. The dining room waitress brought over two bowls of rice, and he said, “Eat,” and then ate heartily. I wanted to laugh. To be precise, this was not him treating me to eat or drink, but him coming to share a portion from my bowl. The waitress, Xiao Jiang, might have found it embarrassing, and she brought over a small plate of what seemed to be freshly cut duck gizzards and placed it in front of us. This county magistrate, without any explanation, pushed it aside with his hand, making it stand by.

I was just about to laugh when my professional habit suddenly made me gain a bit of novelty from the trivial. This county magistrate actually did not recognize the waitress Xiao Jiang in the small dining room of the county guesthouse. It was still me, the guest, who introduced her to him, and then he casually asked her how long she had been there, and the answer was two years.

This time I couldn't hold back my laughter and jokingly said to them, “This fact can only have two explanations: either you, the county magistrate, come to the small dining room ‘deeply’ too little, or you, the small dining room staff, are not good at flattering people.”

Everyone laughed, almost all the chefs and waitresses in the small dining room laughed heartily. On those laughing faces, they wrote a response to my words, and they also wrote praise for their frugal and clean county magistrate.

At this moment, inspiration spread my wings of thought. I suddenly thought of the yesterday and today of this county, thought of their hard-won fruits of reform and entrepreneurship, thought of their proud declaration that the county's total production value had achieved a two-fold increase 11 years ahead of schedule. Indeed, if we summarize their experience, it might not be the first to mention frugality and cleanliness, diligence and public service. But this cannot be underestimated!

Walking out, I silently asked the vast sky: If the fruits of economic reform were accompanied by a friendly face of corruption, what would that mean? The sky closed its eyes.

Only the poet “Wang Changling's” seven-character quatrains rang in my ears:

“If friends in Luoyang ask, tell them my heart is pure as ice in a jade vase.”

　　大地的儿子
　　任斌武
    正是春花烂漫的五月，有幸来到“烟笼寒水月笼沙”的秦淮河畔，诗人王昌龄当过几载七品县令的小县城。好个佳绝的去处！天宇如此净洁，风色如此醉人。
    “洛阳亲友如相问，一片冰心在玉壶。”
    “在邑有善政，一县无诤辞”。
    每当漫步于这六朝金粉、十代古都的江宁之地，昔日那位为平民百姓称作“王江宁”的“七绝圣手”王昌龄那许多风骨内含，高标逸世的七言绝句，和平民百姓的口口交誉便犹在耳中。
    抑或，这座历尽沧桑的历史名城，今日仍沿袭着千古遗风？抑或有关我的某种“行迹”招来众多路人的兴味？
    “你是冲着我们这乡野僻地提前十年翻两番来的吧？”
    “你来到这六朝烟水之地，可晓得江宁几多‘王江宁’？”
    正是来自平民百姓的口口交誉，把我引领进一个新的人物画廊，结识了一位颇具时代风采的“王江宁”。
    马路轶事
    清晨，我迎着远天那一团鲜丽的酡红，穿过寂寂的小街，赶往郊外河畔去完成活动筋骨的必修课。
    行至县府门前，一位生得佼秀的女清洁工歇下扫帚，微微笑着与我打招呼。她显然是早注意到我，且多少摸得一点底细。笑靥里深藏着一个谜，问我可认识后边那位大姐？
    后边是位身个儿不高的中年妇女，戴着让飞扬的尘垢染成土灰色的口罩和工作帽。手里一把大扫帚一辆垃圾车，动作娴熟地边扫边撮，忙得手脚不停。待我看真切了，年轻的女清洁工方才眉眼里透着明显的自豪感，悄声告诉我：那是我们当今县令的胞姊，名叫陈桂香；已与大扫帚垃圾车相伴度过几年的岁月。
    不知是我观念上出了毛病，还是我把当今世界看得过分暗淡了些，我总不肯轻信这种“马路轶闻”。及至上前细细考察过这名陈桂香者的一副眉眼长相，再拿当今县令陈大法的那副长相作过反复类比论证，方才消除戒意，开放“视听”。
    那年，陈桂香随丈夫从东北调回本县，年纪已四十出头。对工作分配，大法有话在先：眼前县里待业青年远没分完，桂香分不到工作就算，要干就找个别人不愿干的地方干几年吧。赶巧县里筹建环卫所，他当即拍板，支持姐姐当上扫马路的清洁工。
    扫马路，对当过多年工人的桂香姐倒没什么了不得，但在这样一种特殊环境里扫马路，她却多出一层心事。因此，上班好长一段时间，总远远避开县府大门，单扫大街东路那一段。大法察觉了，找到姐姐面前。没错，让他猜对了，姐姐正是怕在他县衙门前扫马路，给她当县长的弟弟丢面子，也怕不知根底的说他的闲话。
      “嗬呀！怕什么？这能给我丢了什么？我当县长你扫马路一样光明正大！你只管去那边扫，扫到县政府门口有什么不好？好！……”大法说得爽朗而坦荡。
    桂香姐放了心。每天清早，大扫帚挥着，府前街，十字口，一条大路扫到头。
    这似乎缺少点人情味儿，手足情。其实，大法县长十分敬重他这唯一的胞姊。他也不会忘却姐姐的恩情。他们幼年丧父之后，正是大姐辅助母亲支撑着这个贫寒之家。
    在最困难的年月，姐姐正是为支持他读书，背井离乡去了东北。最后，他来到姐姐面前，说了个极浅显又极深奥的道理：
    “中国老百姓对我们这些人最不满意的是我们自身不清，自身不正。我们不能麻木不仁……”
    也巧，这头事犹未了，那头事端又起。陈桂香的儿子，大法县长的外甥冯伟，化肥厂的修理工干腻了，“方便之门”走不通，便使出了绝招儿。趁大法县长出差在外的几天，悄悄办好调动手续，跳槽到某公司当上供销员。其侥幸心理是不难理解的：
    这号事，木已成舟，任人尽知，只要你闭上半只眼睛，也就“眼不见为净”了。
    然而谁知，大法县长的信息特灵，回得县来第二天，电话找到他，一声“无法无天”！接下来便是最后通牒：“立刻回原单位当你的修理工，否则将通知两边停发工资！”
    有传闻说，为这联翩而至的“绝情”事，陈桂香怒火中烧，曾在大马路上挥着扫帚痛骂过她家的县长大人。但我当面问及，她都彻底否认，而且有如蒙受天大不白之冤那样难以容忍，急得话也不知该说哪句是好。
    “你要有空，去看看陈仔，就不用再打听这个了。”
　　非澹泊无以致远
    陈仔何许人？县长夫人。
    她是在劳动服务公司工作。我找到公司办公楼那天上午，她正一身汗淋淋的，抱个大拖把在拖那长长的水磨汀走廊。
    她当的是工勤员。这职务乍听觉着陌生，等到在她烧开水的小屋子里坐下，听她把她的职权范围——扫地、打开水、倒痰盂、冲厕所、送信、拿报纸……如数家珍的讲过，我才恍然明白过来，就是部队里的勤务兵和通讯员。据说她在这个岗位上，已兢兢业业，恪尽职守，整整干了四五年。
    “这种活儿干得惯吗？”
    “干得惯。什么活还不一样干？”
    “这地方连奖金什么的，月收入有多少？”
    “这里没奖金，七七八八都算上，去年以前一直是70多元，今年能拿100了。”
    我不是拜金主义者。我之所以问这个，是因为由此而想到别的一些有关情节。人们告诉我，几年里，大法县长的一些同事、朋友、同级、下级，曾为陈仔找过各样门路，想为她安排个实惠的工作，能增加一点收入，改善一下家庭财政的拮据状况。大法不问情由怎样，动机如何，回答是同一言辞：“别再操这份心。她文化水平低，干这个就合适。不能硬塞到别处，叫她去吃照顾饭，拿亏心钱。为老婆孩子多捞点好处调动工作，这不叫以权谋私还能有什么别的解释？！”
    从平民百姓的口碑上获知，大法县长上有古稀老母，下有一双尚在读书的儿子，只靠两口子二百几十元的月薪，养活着五口之家，日子过得十分艰难清苦。多年来，终日是青菜萝卜当家，每周饭桌上只能有一次荤菜，供全家打打牙祭。入冬前，陈仔一次买上一两百斤红萝卜，腌制成萝卜干，全家老少一直吃到来年青菜萝卜上市。妻子瞧着大法年纪轻轻头发白了许多，心疼之下，俭省着每天给他煮上两个鸡蛋。大法推给母亲，母亲推给孙子，一个也吃不到他口里。
    大儿子上高中了。路远，人家都骑自行车，他没有，只能每天坐在同学的车后座上让人家搭带着。老母亲在大法耳边念叨过多次，他总不当一回事：“小孩子跑跑路算什么？别把他惯坏唠！”要不是那回从人家车后座上摔下来，受伤缝了那么多针，恐怕现在也莫奢想骑上辆自行车。说来难以置信，堂堂一县之长，截至1988年8月底之前，家庭电器化水平的唯一体现者是一台14英寸黑白电视机。下半年说是彩电要涨价，孩子们呼声日高一日，两口子才不得不各借了点钱，买了台18英寸彩电，使家庭现代化向前跨进了一步。为此支付的代价是：家庭餐桌上刚刚突破一周开斋一餐的水平线，又直线回落；从工资袋里扣了半年有余，如今依然是个倒挂户。
      一天晚上，我带着一个常人的困惑来到这位县长的官邸。他本人不在，其妻陈仔与年迈的老母接待了我。落座后，趁她们张罗烟茶的空儿，我约略打量过这座普通职工居民楼房中的普通居室：敝旧的老式沙发，敝旧的与清苦生活绝对和谐而统一的家具……清贫写在这个家庭的每一件陈设上。直面着这一切，我想到这位县长所执政的这个江宁县。有充分的资料与事实证明，自1984年后，即在他与该县县委书记陈宗林的任期内，全县生产总值每年均以30％上下的幅度扶摇直上；已在本年度内提前11年实现了2000年的翻两番。本县内每个普通农民的纯收入也不折不扣地翻了两番。我一时间心理失衡，不由思之悠悠，想到当今的时尚，当今讳莫如深的“横向”与“纵向”。我在想，如果这位七品县令改变一种姿态，改变一种道德观与价值观，这一切将是怎样一个模样？
    然而，这里有一道天堑，有一座城池，有一条天险腊子口。
    道德的城池
    古人云：“穷居闹市无人识，富在深山有远亲。”有人说：如今，若把一个“富”字改作“权”字，也是得体的了。
    七品之位未必显赫，然来钻这门洞坐这沙发者也堪谓摩肩接踵。
    两年前的某个晚上，一位年逾花甲的老妈妈走进这个门里，目光犹疑地上下打量着大法县长。
    “县长……你还认识我吗？”
    陈大法一看，急忙肃然立起，亲昵地叫了一声“魏阿姨”。上前搀扶老人坐下，恭恭敬敬忙着敬茶招待，问病问寒。
    不久后的又一个晚上，老人带着她的独生女儿，二次走进这个门里。县长的称谓改成昔日喊惯了的“大法”。一声“大法，阿姨把你看错了”出口，已经老泪纵横。
    时光已悠悠流逝了二十年。那时，还是个穷中学生的陈大法，患急症住进县城医院。那正是“文革”的动乱年月，又赶上农忙时节，寡居在农村的母亲无法进城照料他。他肚子痛得嗷嗷叫着在床上打滚，也叫不应个医生护士。正处于急难时刻，一位素昧平生的“母亲”来到他的病榻前，默默为他煎汤熬药，洗衣送饭，日夜守护着他，服侍着他。有谁记得，那双母亲的手多少次轻轻为他擦干泉涌的冷汗？有谁知道，那片慈母之情长所托献给你的是血肉？是肝胆？还是……最初，他只知道跟着人家叫她魏阿姨，出院前才知道，她是一名极普通极普通的工勤员。
    如今，老人年老多病，告老还家。闻知当年的大法当了县长，便不揣冒昧寻找上门。自然地，一双浑沌的眸珠朝着大法县长呆望了许久，方才言语木讷地道出她之所求：她那位吃了一生粉笔灰的老伴已经故去，只剩下她寡母孤女相依为命，今年学医的女儿将毕业，希望能安排在身边，有个照应。
    久于澹泊，多知危苦之事。这个素来不齿任何“后门”行径的陈大法，竟慨然应诺：“魏阿姨，你的要求是在情理之中的，你放心回去吧，我一定帮你去办。”就是这样一个魏阿姨，当女儿真的分到身边医院工作之后，她居然举债买来偌大一包谢礼，携其女儿送到大法县长的门上。
    人民啊，我们的人民啊！
    这能怪她吗？当事情还没办时，多少好心人的话已经灌满她的耳朵：
    “如今办事不同以前，不能死心眼儿！”
    “昨天归昨天，当官就变，有权就贪。”
    大家都这么说，自己的女儿也这么说。
    她终于信了，服了。但是，当那个晚上，大法县长像出了什么了不得的大事似的，夫妇俩提上那一大“包”，穿街走巷，原封给她送回来的时候，老人却又迷惘了，疑惑了。他自然是决意不肯。
      “魏阿姨，你别糊涂了。我不管当了什么，还是那个大法，还是普通人，有普通人一样的良知和感情。你女儿当医生是为大家看病的，我当县长是为大家办事的，是一回事。”后头还有句刺耳的，“你这样做，不是把我们看成贪官污吏
  了吗？”
      大法县长连处理方案都给想好了：营养品老人自己留着补身体，其他贵重物品由他帮着去退货，钱不够还由他填补。
    待老人真的明白过来，便愧悔交集，唏嘘出声了。那句听来平平常常想来撼人心魄的话，正是和着这样的眼泪发自心头的。
    “阿姨把你看错了！……”
    古有名训“官不打送礼的”，这陈大法偏是个违“情”悖“理”的角色。想来送几条烟，几瓶酒，几包什么玩艺儿，或许值不了几个钱。然而这道德的城池一旦失守，它的纵深处却是整个国家，整个儿的民族呵！所以，多一些拿棍棒的陈大法，是时代之需，国人之幸。
    大地之子
    陈大法来了；来跟我聊了场改革的甘苦。
    这位年方42岁的县长，身高不过1.65米，反应快，言语快，睿智而练达，一派年轻人的勃勃生气。他不像个县长，不像个政府官员。他让人想到赤脚医生，教书匠，农机站的技术员；他毕业于农业学院本科，是个知识型、开拓型的县长。他平民意识强固，官本位意识淡弱，兴趣极为广泛。经济学，生态学，遗传工程，行为科学，小说选刊，报告文学，什么都喜欢，抓到手就读，就钻（幸运，连我这个知名度有限的笔者20年前几个作品的人物、情节都记得那么清楚）。干起来铺下身子没命地干，玩起来游泳、打球、跑马拉松扎进平民群里一起来。
    这令我想到前不久，他在一个什么会上所作的自我剖白：“不管县长的模式是个什么样，得先承认我的性格，允许我的性格存在……”据说，说出这话的当时，曾有不少人觉得陌生，纳罕，惊奇得直打格愣。我倒是觉着来得洒脱，新鲜。
    他究竟是怎样一种性格呢？他性格中的哪些方面需得以允许而方能存在呢？我问过该县机关一位熟悉大法县长的人。这位同志颇有些文学素养，他给我提供了一个性格与形象的载体。
    就在上个月里，大法县长穿着他那身“一贯制”的低档料子破旧西装，一早搭上乡间的公共汽车。下车后，又是一二十里的徒步行军，串乡走村蹲田头，找着农民聊天。什么事呢：不久前县里开会部署了农业生产，制订了若干条发展农业的具体措施。他要直接找到作田的农民了解了解，那些措施有没有落到实处？分给农民的化肥、柴油有没有如期如数到手？夺取今年丰收有无把握？农民对政府还有什么要求？一天跑下来，转了三个乡四个行政村。情况不错，都落实得挺好，农民挺高兴。他也放下了心。但是，太阳落山前，他来到某村口，却让几个农民围住，向他诉起苦衷。说他们村搞不好，田里的活儿没心思干，丰收是纸上谈兵。往深里查问，原来毛病出在大队（行政村）书记身上，他挪用了村办企业的1.5万元，买了一辆什么车，只顾自个去跑运输赚钱了，哪还有心思管农业？陈大法细细查对过事实，当晚赶到乡政府，找到乡里领导。当头一声喝问：“问问他还干不干共产党了？告诉他，两条路由他选：立刻交出款子，作出检查；撤销职务，强令退款！”
    好，一个活脱脱的陈大法！
    我们一气聊到中午。是吃饭的时候了，他慨然一挥手：“走，我陪你吃一餐饭。”我以为又是惯例，趁谈正事的机会，邀我美餐一顿。走进招待所的小餐厅，我不胜诧异。还是我平常进餐的那个地方，餐桌上没有任何饮料之类，没有任何纸巾酒杯这些时兴玩艺儿。还是我那一贯制的两荤两素一汤。餐厅服务员给送上两碗米饭，他说了声“吃”，便雷厉风行吃开了。我直想笑。这确切些说，不是他请我吃喝什么，倒是他来帮忙分享我碗里的一份了。餐厅女服务员小姜或许看着寒碜，又端来一小盘显然是刚刚切好的鸭肝肫放在我们面前。这位县长，没作任何解释，顺手把它推到一边，让它靠边站了。
    我正想笑，突然职业癖作崇，令我从细微处获得一点新奇感。这位县长竟然不认识县招待所小餐厅的这名女服务员。还是我这客人向他介绍过人家的姓氏，他才信口问了问人家来这里多久了，回答是两年。
    这回我忍俊不住了，哈哈笑着同他们开了两句玩笑：“这个事实只能有两种解释：不是你县长来小餐厅‘深入’得太少，就是你们小餐厅的诸位太不善于拍马屁了。”
    大家哄地笑了，几乎小餐厅的所有师傅服务员都畅意地笑了。这一张张笑脸上，书写着对我一语中的的回应，也书写着对他们这位澹泊廉洁的县长的褒奖。
    此时，灵感鼓起我遐思的双翼。使我蓦然想到这个县的昨天与今天，想到他们创业改革的丰硕之果，想到他们已豪迈地宣告全县总产值已提前十一年实现了2000年的翻两番。诚然，若总结其经验，或许未必首提澹泊清廉，勤勉奉公这一条。但是，绝不可小视这一条！
    走出门来，我在无声地问着莽莽苍穹：倘使经济改革的硕果与貌以可亲的腐败结伴而至，那将意味着什么？苍穹紧闭上了眼睛。
    只有诗人“王江宁”那七言绝句铮铮在耳：
    “洛阳亲友如相问，
    一片冰心在玉壶。”
