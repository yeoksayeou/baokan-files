Your newspaper published a letter and photograph titled "The Effectiveness of Propaganda Windows" on the sixth page on July 26. Following this, our county's relevant departments promptly cleared the stalls randomly set up in front of the propaganda windows in our county town. They repaired the damaged windows and replaced them with new propaganda content. At the same time, the county government issued a notice to strengthen the management of urban traffic and the urban environment. Now, our county town is clean, beautiful, and the roads are unobstructed.

    安远县城整顿摊点　宣传橱窗换新内容
    你报7月26日第六版刊登了《宣传橱窗的效用》的读者来信和照片后，我县有关部门立即清理了我县县城宣传橱窗前随意摆设的摊点，对破损的橱窗进行了修复，换上了新的宣传内容。同时，县政府还发出通告，加强对城市交通、市容的管理。现在，我县县城市容整洁美观，道路畅通。
