General Secretary Jiang Zemin today, in the Zhongnanhai Huairen Hall, met with participants of the Central State Organs Party Work Conference and the Third Session of the Central State Organs Party Committee Secretary Study Class. He emphasized that central state organs hold significant state power, and it is crucial to strengthen party building. Party building in state organs is not just the responsibility of the party committee; party groups and ministers must also take it seriously and ensure it is effectively implemented.

Leaders Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Song Ping, Li Tieying, Ding Guan'gen, Hu Qiaomu, Kang Keqing, Luo Gan, and Zhang Jingyuan also attended the meeting.

Jiang Zemin said, "Through this turmoil and riot, we have deeply understood the importance of doing a good job in party work. The party building in central state organs is an important part of the overall party building and cannot be neglected."

Jiang Zemin said, "Since the founding of New China, our party has undergone the test of being in power. State organs hold certain powers and are responsible for various aspects of work. Therefore, the construction of clean government and party style is very important, and this will have a significant impact nationwide. The Central State Organs Work Committee should start from the actual situation of the organs and strengthen party building. Central state organs should set an example in all aspects, with personal conduct being more important than words."

Jiang Zemin pointed out that the mainstream of central state organs is good, but the body has also been corrupted by bourgeois liberalization. It is important to strengthen both organ work and party work. He hopes that the party work in the organs will achieve new and greater successes.

Li Peng said in his speech that in the organs, the conditions for becoming a minister or deputy minister have previously emphasized business skills more than political qualifications, weakening party work. During this turmoil and riot, the leadership and cadres of various departments have mostly performed well, but some have not. In the future, ministers should not only be proficient in their business but also be revolutionaries and politicians, relying on party organizations to do their work. The organ party committees should also play their due roles.

Li Peng pointed out that during the period of rectification and reform, we face many difficulties. Only by relying on our own efforts, working hard, and uniting to overcome these difficulties can we achieve new victories in socialist modernization construction. He hopes that party organizations at all levels will play a good supervisory and guaranteeing role.

This Central State Organs Party Work Conference was held in Beijing on October 10th. Participants included party committee secretaries and organization department directors from various departments of central state organs. The main agenda of the conference was to discuss and propose opinions on strengthening party building in central state organs based on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Party Building."

At the beginning of the conference, Luo Gan, Secretary of the Central State Organs Work Committee and Secretary-General of the State Council, delivered a speech. He pointed out that the importance and urgency of strengthening party building in organs should be fully recognized, the current situation of the party's team and work in central state organs should be correctly assessed, spirits should be boosted, efforts should be made, and party building in central state organs should be jointly strengthened to raise the level of party work in central state organs to a new height.

    江泽民总书记强调
    切实抓好中央国家机关党的建设
    李鹏总理要求各部部长成为精通业务的革命家政治家
    新华社北京10月12日电　（记者孙本尧）中共中央总书记江泽民今天在中南海怀仁堂会见参加中央国家机关党的工作会议和中央国家机关第三期党委书记研究班的同志时说，中央国家机关掌握着国家的重要权力，抓好党的建设极为重要。机关党的建设，不仅机关党委要抓，党组和部长也要抓，一定要切实抓好。
    李鹏、乔石、宋平、李铁映、丁关根、胡乔木、康克清、罗干、张镜源等领导同志也参加了会见。
    江泽民说，通过这次动乱和暴乱，我们深刻地领悟到做好党的工作的重要性。中央国家机关党的建设，是整个党的建设的重要组成部分，不是可有可无的。
    江泽民说，新中国成立后，我们党经历着执政的考验。国家机关都掌握着一定的权力，负责着方方面面的工作。所以，机关的廉政建设、党风建设很重要，这方面搞好了，对全国影响很大。中央国家机关工委要从机关的实际出发，抓好党的建设。中央国家机关要处处起模范作用，身教重于言教。
    江泽民指出，中央国家机关的主流是好的，但肌体也受到资产阶级自由化思想的腐蚀。抓好机关工作和党的工作都很重要。他希望机关党的工作取得新的更大的成绩。
    李鹏同志在讲话时说，在机关里，什么条件能当部长、副部长，过去考核业务多，政治考核重视不够，党的工作受到削弱。在这次动乱和暴乱中，各部的领导和干部大部分表现是好的，但有的表现不大好。今后，要求各部部长不仅应精通业务，而且应是革命家、政治家，要依靠党组织做好工作。机关党委也应发挥应有的作用。
    李鹏指出，在治理整顿时期，我们面临不少困难。只有自力更生，艰苦奋斗，团结起来克服这些困难，我们才能取得社会主义现代化建设的新胜利。希望各级机关党组织发挥好监督保证作用。
    这次中央国家机关党的工作会议是10月10日在北京召开的，参加会议的有中央国家机关各部门的机关党委书记、组织部长。会议的主要议题是，根据党的十三届四中全会和《中共中央关于加强党的建设的通知》精神，讨论提出加强中央国家机关党的建设的意见。
    会议开始时，中共中央国家机关工委书记、国务院秘书长罗干讲了话。他指出，要充分认识加强机关党的建设的重要性和紧迫性，正确估计中央国家机关党的队伍和党的工作的现状，振奋精神，努力工作，同心协力抓好机关党的建设，把中央国家机关党的工作提高到一个新水平。（附图片）
