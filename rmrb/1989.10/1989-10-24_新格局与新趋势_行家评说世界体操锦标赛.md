The 25th World Gymnastics Championships has concluded. What is the current state of the world's top gymnastics teams, and what are the development trends? The reporter sought the opinions of international gymnastics federation special invited judge Lu Enchun and others.

The gap between teams is narrowing

Lu Enchun said that this competition showed that major gymnastics powers like the Soviet Union and Romania are still in a leading position. The Soviet Union has a new generation of stars, and despite the expulsion of Bilozertsev, the injury to Liukin, and the retirement of Shushunova, their dominant position remains unshakable. Especially in the men's and women's team events and the men's and women's all-around gold medals, which were all won by the Soviet Union, showing their strong strength. In the women's events, Romania's strength is still formidable, with Silivas winning 3 gold medals. In the men's events, the East German team's strength has increased, winning the men's team silver medal.

However, on the other hand, many previously unknown countries are emerging with new talents, such as the women's team from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as Spain and the United States. Moreover, teams that were once dominant but have since declined for a long time, such as Italy and Hungary, have also seen the emergence of new talents and can compete.

China has great potential

China's gymnastics has been in a period of decline, but this time, China won three gold medals and five bronze medals, showing that the Chinese team has great potential. In last year's Olympics, the Chinese men's team lost to the Japanese team by 0.35 points, but this time, they defeated the Japanese team by more than 3 points and have the strength to compete with the East German team. In the team compulsory exercises, the Chinese team was only 0.05 points behind the East German team. China's gymnastics has made significant progress. This time, participating in the competition, judges from various countries praised the Chinese athletes' understanding of the compulsory exercises. The new rules have only been in place for a year, and we have not had contact with other teams, but we have practiced in seclusion.

Difficulty and quality are key

From a technical perspective, the difficulty in men's gymnastics is the focus, and the requirements for quality are getting higher and higher. For example, in the rings, even a one-degree difference from horizontal will result in a deduction, whether it's 15 degrees or 16 degrees, it's strictly judged. During the rings final, the scores couldn't go up, and this is the reason. The difficulty in women's gymnastics is also developing, with Kim Kwang-suk from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea performing a connection that even men have not done. Additionally, the structure of the movements is also changing.

　　新格局与新趋势
　　——行家评说世界体操锦标赛
    第25届世界体操锦标赛已落下帷幕。世界强队之间目前处于何种状态，发展趋势如何？记者就此请教了国际体联特邀裁判陆恩淳等。
    各队差距在缩小
    陆恩淳说，本届大赛表明，体操大国如苏联、罗马尼亚仍然处于绝对领先地位。苏联新秀迭出，群星灿烂，在比洛泽尔采夫被开除、柳金受伤、舒舒诺娃退役之后，霸主地位仍不可动摇。尤其是男女团体赛和男女个人全能金牌被苏联囊括，显示了强大的实力。女子项目，罗马尼亚雄风犹存，西利瓦斯一人夺得3枚金牌。男子项目，民主德国队实力增强，夺走男子团体银牌。
    但是，另外一方面，过去大批默默无闻的国家，正在涌现新秀，如朝鲜民主主义人民共和国女队以及西班牙和美国队等。而且那些一度称雄、而后长时间衰落的队伍，如意大利、匈牙利等也都出现了新秀，可以一拚。
    中国队大有希望
    中国的体操运动前个时期消沉了一段，但是，这次一举夺得三块金牌和五块铜牌，这说明中国队大有潜力。去年奥运会，中国男队以0.35分的差距负于日本队，这次以3分多的优势压倒日本队，并且有实力同民主德国队争高低。团体赛规定动作比赛，中国队同民主德国队只差0.05分。中国体操运动已经取得长足进步。这次参赛，各国裁判都称赞中国选手规定动作理解对路。新规则才定出一年，我们和其他队也没接触，是关门练出来的。
    难度质量是关键
    从技术角度看，男子体操难度是焦点，同时对质量要求越来越高。例如吊环的大十字，现在双臂与水平差一度都要扣分，你是15度还是16度，抠得很严。吊环决赛时，得分一直打不上去，就是这个道理。女子难度也有发展，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的金光淑作出男子都没作过的动作连接。此外，动作结构也在变化之中。
