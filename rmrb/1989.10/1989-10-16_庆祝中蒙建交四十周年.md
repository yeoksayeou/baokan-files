Today, October 16, marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic. We are delighted to celebrate this joyous occasion. Looking back at the past and forward to the future, we are confident about the bright prospects for the development of relations between the two countries.

The peoples of China and Mongolia have a long-standing and deep friendship. Whether during the revolutionary war years or the period of socialist construction, the two peoples have always supported and helped each other. In the 1950s, despite being in the early stages of our nation's founding and facing financial constraints, we provided three loans to Mongolia and sent a large number of experts and technical workers to help build more than 20 major and medium-sized industrial and agricultural projects and facilities, providing assistance within our capabilities for Mongolia's socialist construction. At the same time, Mongolia also supported our socialist construction to the best of its ability, donating 15,000 horses in 1958 and providing flour, wheat, beef, and mutton without compensation during the years when our country suffered natural disasters.

In the mid-1960s, the relationship between the two countries experienced a period of twists and turns, which is now in the past. We look to the future. Since the 1980s, with the joint efforts of both China and Mongolia, the relationship between the two countries has gradually recovered, improved, and developed. The level of mutual visits between the two countries' delegations has been steadily increasing, and long-term trade agreements, consular treaties, and border regulations have been signed. This year, the relationship between the two countries has seen new developments, with the signing of three agreements and a judicial assistance treaty on the establishment of economic and technological cooperation committees. Economic and technological, cultural exchanges have been continuously expanding, and the number of people traveling between the two countries has been increasing significantly. In particular, the mutual visits of the two countries' foreign ministers and the resumption of relations between the two parties have important significance in promoting the further development of relations between the two countries. It is worth noting that the two sides have reached a principled agreement on the official visit of Batmonkh, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural. The important visit scheduled for next year will bring the relationship between the two countries to a new stage.

In recent years, as the relationship between the two countries has continued to improve and develop, the exchanges between the two countries' friendly organizations and friendship associations have also gradually expanded and strengthened. Since 1985, they have exchanged delegations every year and sent delegations of active members of the friendship associations for mutual visits. Through these visits, mutual understanding has deepened, friendship between the peoples of the two countries has increased, and it has played an active role in promoting the continued development of friendly neighborly relations between the two countries.

China and Mongolia are neighboring countries connected by mountains and rivers. Both countries are engaged in socialist construction and are also carrying out reforms in their economic and political systems. The peoples of the two countries can learn from each other and exchange experiences. Developing friendly neighborly relations between the two countries is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and will help promote the socialist construction of the two countries and contribute to peace in Asia and the world. I believe that through the joint efforts of both sides, the friendly neighborly relations between China and Mongolia will definitely be further developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

I have had the honor of working twice at the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia and have personally witnessed the rapid development of production and construction in the Mongolian People's Republic, the continuous improvement of people's lives, and the significant changes in the urban landscape. In particular, the Mongolian people's enthusiasm, hospitality, diligence, and simplicity, the deep affection of the Mongolian people for the Chinese people, and the great achievements of the Mongolian people in various fields of socialist construction have left a deep impression on me. I am happy about the various achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic and sincerely wish the Mongolian people continuous new and greater achievements in socialist construction and various reform endeavors. I wish for the continuous development of friendly neighborly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Mongolia, and for the further strengthening of the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

    庆祝中蒙建交四十周年
    中蒙友协会长　孟英
    今年10月16日是中华人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国建交40周年纪念日。我们怀着愉快的心情庆祝这一喜庆的日子。回顾过去，展望未来，我们对两国关系发展的美好前景充满信心。
    中蒙两国人民之间有着传统的深厚友谊。无论在革命战争年代，还是在社会主义建设时期，两国人民一向互相支援、互相帮助。50年代，尽管我国处于建国初期，财力不足，仍然先后向蒙方提供三笔经援贷款，并派遣了大批专家和技术工人，为蒙古建成20多个大中型工农业项目和设施，对蒙古的社会主义建设提供了力所能及的援助。同时，蒙古也力所能及地支援了我国的社会主义建设事业，1958年赠送役马1.5万匹；在我国遭受自然灾害的年代，又无偿支援面粉、小麦、牛羊肉等。
    60年代中期以后，两国关系曾经历过一段曲折，现已成为过去，我们面向未来。进入80年代以来，在中蒙双方共同努力下，两国关系逐步恢复、改善与发展，两国代表团互访级别逐年提高，先后签订了长期贸易协定、领事条约、边界制度条约。今年以来，两国关系又有新的发展，双方签订了关于建立经贸、科技合作委员会等3个协定和司法协助条约，经贸、科技、文化交往不断扩大，人员往来大量增加，尤其是两国外长的互访和两党关系的恢复对推动两国关系的进一步发展具有重要意义。这里特别要指出的是，双方已就蒙古人民革命党中央委员会总书记、大人民呼拉尔主席团主席巴特蒙赫同志正式访华达成了原则协议。预定明年进行的这次重要访问，将使两国关系发展到新的阶段。
    近年来，随着两国关系不断改善与发展，两国对外友好组织和两国友协之间的联系与交往也逐步扩大与加强。1985年以来，他们每年都有代表团交流，还派友协积极分子代表团进行了互访。通过这些访问，加深了相互了解，增进了两国人民的友谊，对促进两国睦邻关系继续发展起了积极的作用。
    中蒙两国是山水相连的近邻，两国都在进行社会主义建设，也在进行经济体制与政治体制改革，两国人民可以互相学习，相互交流经验。发展两国睦邻友好关系符合两国人民的根本利益，也有助于促进两国的社会主义建设事业，有利于亚洲与世界和平。我相信，通过双方的共同努力，中蒙两国睦邻友好关系在和平共处五项原则基础上一定会得到进一步的发展。
    我曾有幸两次在我国驻蒙古大使馆工作，亲眼看到蒙古人民共和国生产建设迅速发展，人民生活不断提高，城市面貌大为改观，特别是蒙古人民热情好客和勤劳淳朴，蒙古人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，蒙古人民在社会主义建设的各个领域中取得的巨大成就，给我留下了深刻的印象。我为蒙古人民共和国取得的各项成就感到高兴，并衷心祝愿蒙古人民在社会主义建设和各项改革事业中不断取得新的、更大的成就，祝中蒙两国睦邻友好与互利合作关系不断发展，祝中蒙两国人民的传统友谊进一步加强。
