In 1984, the various forestry bureaus in the Changbai Mountains completed their construction, and the Jilin Provincial Forestry Engineering Company, which had served as the "pioneer," found itself with no work to do. It seemed they were on the brink of collapse.

Could they afford to "collapse"? There were over 1,000 young people unemployed, nearly 1,000 female workers idle, over 1,000 retired personnel to support, and nearly 1,000 households without housing. What to do? This large construction enterprise, distributed across the Changbai Mountain forest area, had made tremendous contributions to the development of the deep mountains and old forests. Now that the work was "completed," relying on the little work in the forestry sector was no longer enough to satisfy their needs.

"Old Song, these few thousand people are in your hands! Whether it's to reorganize or to go out into society to make a living, you just need to find a way to support these people for the state!" Song Xuexian, the company manager appointed in times of difficulty, was not intimidated by the challenges. Like a tiger emerging from the mountains, he led his enterprise with a mighty force, charging into the vast social market.

"What's the Forestry Construction Company? It's just a rustic outfit, building a few temporary bridges and paths in the forest." When the Forestry Construction Company first emerged, society did not take them seriously.

This company was like a hungry tiger searching for food. They would take the "bones" that others left behind and eat the "chicken feet and duck feet" that others looked down upon.

There is a bridge called Mijiang on the Tumen Highway. Due to the poor water quality of the river, concrete could not be mixed, and because it was an oblique bridge, the installation of the bridge deck and piers was difficult. No one wanted to take on this job. Song Xuexian believed that the more difficult the project, the more convincing it would be if they completed it. He personally went to the site, oversaw the development of the construction plan, and dispatched his most capable engineers to handle the construction. The bridge was completed on schedule and of excellent quality. They also installed two bright copper plaques on the bridgehead pillars, engraved with the name of the construction unit.

"Such a good bridge was built by the Forestry Construction Company," people went from doubt to trust, seeing the strength of the Forestry Construction Company. Among many competitors, the construction command of the Hunchun Power Plant also chose the Forestry Construction Company, entrusting them with the Yingan Grand Bridge, coal ash pipeline bridge, and water source projects leading to the power plant.

The Baicheng Particleboard Factory is a national key project, with all equipment imported from West Germany. The investment was nearly one billion yuan. The main workshop has a span of 30 meters, nearly 200 meters long, a single-layer height of over 20 meters, and a single component weighing over 20 tons. This project was initially designated for a construction company to handle, with almost no competition. Not only did they have strong capabilities, but they had just completed a particleboard factory of the same scale, and the project quality and progress were very satisfactory to the client. They believed that the Forestry Construction Company could not handle such a large project.

Song Xuexian had long wanted to tackle a major project. He decided to seize the opportunity. From the commissioning of the design to the review of the plan and the bidding, the Forestry Construction Company's people were always involved in "project tracking." In July 1987, the design department and the manufacturing plant held a design plan review meeting in Beijing. Song Xuexian personally attended, bringing two engineers to the venue. This unexpected guest smiled and spoke about the logic of the underdog's victory. He boldly proposed, "We like to take on comparable projects. I guarantee three things: the project period will be shortened by half a year, and the quality will be improved by one level. How about it?"

In this way, they managed to secure what seemed like an unattainable project. The company dispatched the deputy manager as the commander-in-chief, with fast construction speed and good quality. The factory gave high praise at the commendation meeting, stating, "The Forestry Construction Company is indeed reliable and truly a specially capable engineering company."

The Forestry Construction Company blazed a trail for survival, securing ten key projects in three regions of Jilin Province. Out of the eight major projects in Yanbian, they secured six. At this point, colleagues in the construction industry finally woke up from their dreams, exclaiming, "The Northeast Tiger has emerged from the mountains."

The "Northeast Tiger" has a big appetite and seems unsatisfied with the current market. They set their sights on the international stage, targeting Siberia in the Soviet Union, and without hesitation, they took on the Changling Highway project connecting Hunchun to the Soviet border, as well as a 35-kilometer highway project within the Soviet Union. Last November, their convoy set off towards the border amidst falling snow. The dump trucks roared into action, and the people of Hunchun were amazed and delighted, overwhelmed by the strength and efficiency of the Forestry Construction Company.

The Forestry Construction Company emerged from the green cradle of the Changbai Mountains and is now ready to venture into the vast forests of Siberia. They are moving towards the vast social market, not only preserving this forestry team but also achieving remarkable economic benefits. In 1988, the total output value exceeded 60 million yuan, more than three times that of 1984; the realized profit increased by more than four times.

　　东北虎出山
　　鄂华　陈景河
    1984年，长白山脉的各大林业局相继建成，作为“开路先锋”的吉林省林业工程公司无活可干。眼看就要“黄摊”了。
      “黄”得起吗？1000多知青待业，近千名女工赋闲，1000多离退休人员要养活，近千户人家无住房……怎么办？这个分布于长白山林区的庞大施工企业，曾为开发深山老林作出巨大贡献。现今“大功告成”，光靠林业上的那点活，已满足不了他们的“胃口”。
      “老宋，这几千号人就交给你啦！重整旗鼓也好，到社会上打食也行，你只要想办法替国家养活这些人就中！”受命于危难之时的公司经理宋学贤没有被困难吓倒，他像只出山虎，带领他的企业以威猛之势，杀向广阔的社会市场。
    “林建公司算什么，土里土气的，在林子里架个便桥，修条便道而已。”林建公司刚刚出山时，社会上并没有把他们放在眼里。
    这家公司就像饿虎觅食。人家挑剩的“骨头”，他啃；人家看不上眼的“鸡头鸭脚”，他吃。
    图珲公路上有座密江大桥，由于江水水质差，不能搅拌混凝土，加上这是一座斜交桥，桥面和桥墩的安装难度大，没人肯接这个活。宋学贤认为，越是别人不愿干的工程，我们干了，才有说服力。他亲自到现场，主持研究施工方案，派出最得力的工程师负责施工。大桥如期完成，质量优良。他们还在桥头石柱上装嵌两块明亮的铜牌，刻上了施工单位的名字。
      “这么好的桥竟是林建公司干的”，人们从怀疑到信任，看到了林建公司的实力。在众多竞争对手面前，珲春电厂筹建指挥部也选中了林建公司，把通向电厂的英安大桥、输煤灰管线桥和水源地等工程都交给了他们。
    白河刨花板厂是国家重点项目，全套设备从西德引进。投资近亿元。主车间30米跨度，近200米长，单层高度超20米，单个构件超20吨。这个工程一开始就内定要一家建筑公司来干，几乎没有竞争余地，人家不仅力量雄厚，而且刚刚建成同等规模的一个刨花板厂，工程质量和进度都很使甲方满意。人家认为林建公司根本干不了这么大工程。
    宋学贤早就想摸个大工程干干。他决心虎口夺食。工程从委托设计，审查方案，到招投标，一直有林建公司的人在进行“项目跟踪”。1987年7月，设计部门和生产厂家在北京召开设计方案审查会。宋学贤亲自出马，带了两个工程师赶到会场。这位不速之客笑容可掬地讲了一番哀兵必胜的道理。他果敢地提出：“我们就喜欢干可比性工程，我保证三条：工程工期再短半年，质量再好一分。怎么样？”
    就这样，几乎无法到口的肥肉，他们吃到了。公司派出第一副经理亲任总指挥，施工速度快，质量好。厂方在表彰大会上给以高度评价，认为：“林建公司的确过得硬，不愧是特别能战斗的工程公司。”
    林建公司闯出一条生存之路，在吉林省的三个地区拿到了十项重点工程。延边八大工程，他们就拿到了六项。这时候，建筑行业的同行们才如梦初醒，惊呼“东北虎出山了”。
    “东北虎”的胃口很大，似乎不满足现有的市场。他们把眼睛瞄向国外，看中了苏联的西伯利亚，毫不犹豫把珲春通往苏联口岸的长岭公路工程揽了过来，还有苏联境内的35公里公路工程。去年11月下旬，他们的车队迎着纷飞的雪开上边境。大翻斗车哈哈一上阵，珲春人大开眼界，异常欣喜，为林建的力量和效率所折服。
    林建公司从长白山绿色的摇篮中走出来，又将投入西伯利亚大森林中去。他们走向广阔的社会市场，不仅保住了这支林业队伍，而且经济效益可喜。1988年总产值突破6000万元，为1984年的三倍多；实现利润提高到四倍多。
