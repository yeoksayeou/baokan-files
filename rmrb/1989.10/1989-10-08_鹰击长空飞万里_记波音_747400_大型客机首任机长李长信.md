**Eagles Strike the Sky, Flying Ten Thousand Miles—Recalling the First Captain of the Boeing 747-400, Li Changxin**

**Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 8th**

In the golden autumn of October, the sky is clear and the air is crisp. As the nation celebrates the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the reporter visited the newly renovated Beijing Capital International Airport for an interview. The president of China International Airlines, Xu Bailing, told me that they had recently purchased three large aircraft from the United States, with the Boeing 747-400, tail number 2456, being the first.

China International Airlines was established on July 1, 1988, based on the original Beijing Management Bureau of Civil Aviation. This flying team has safely flown for 34 years and has over 100 outstanding pilots who have flown more than 10,000 hours, making it the largest backbone aviation transport enterprise in the country.

President Xu Bailing introduced to me that among the two crews, Li Changxin, Wang Fengquan, Xu Xiukai, Jiang Ping, Zhao Songle, and Fu Zhongwen, Li Changxin is the vice president of our company and the first captain of China's first Boeing 747-400 large aircraft.

At 49 years old, Li Changxin is tall and strong, with a heavy workload as both a company leader and a pilot on international routes. He has safely flown over 12,000 hours and is an excellent "all-weather" captain. Li Changxin is from Xinmin County, Liaoning Province, and still speaks with a pure local accent. He told me that he entered the aviation school in 1958, and three years of intensive study enabled him to master the flight techniques of the "Yun-5" aircraft. Later, he flew the Ilyushin Il-14, Ilyushin Il-18, Boeing 707, and Boeing 747-200 large aircraft, serving as deputy squadron leader, squadron leader, deputy squadron commander, squadron commander, and in 1987, became the squadron commander. He began serving as the vice president of China International Airlines at the start of the previous year.

In the vast blue sky, eagles strike and soar. Over 30 years of flying, Li Changxin has piloted domestic and international flights, flown the leader's special aircraft, and covered the entire country and the world. At the beginning of this year, Li Changxin led four crews of 12 members to the Boeing Company in Seattle, USA, to learn to fly the Boeing 747-400 large aircraft. This aircraft can carry 297 passengers and nearly 80 tons of cargo, but the number of flight crew members has been reduced from 5 to 3. From the outside, this "giant" looks similar to the Boeing 747-200, but all its cockpit equipment uses electronic flight instruments, and takeoff, landing, and in-flight operations can all be automated. Li Changxin said: Although the eight pilots and four communication officers (also known as observers) we selected are all outstanding, during training, no one dared to be careless, and everyone studied very seriously, strictly demanding of themselves. Americans work only five days a week, but we work seven days, even without a break during the Spring Festival. We often stuck cockpit diagrams on the walls of our hotel rooms, and while sitting on the sofa or lying in bed, our eyes were always fixed on the cockpit diagrams, studying late into the night. We memorized and recited, all for the purpose of mastering the advanced technology of this new aircraft type as soon as possible. After theoretical study and simulator flights, Li Changxin and his team finally obtained two certificates of qualification for theoretical courses and simulator training from the American side, with excellent single-flight results. The American instructors commented: "The Chinese are the most disciplined, the most diligent in learning, and the best in flying." The vice president of Boeing's sales department, Jorlton, specially presented Li Changxin with a model airplane to congratulate him and wished for lasting friendship between China and the United States.

    鹰击长空飞万里
    ——记波音747400大型客机首任机长李长信
    本报记者  徐建中
    金秋十月，秋高气爽。正当全国人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝建国四十周年的喜庆日子里，记者来到整修一新的北京首都机场采访。中国国际航空公司总裁徐柏龄告诉我：他们新近从美国购买了三架大型客机，2456号波音——747400是其中的第一架。
    中国国际航空公司是在原民航北京管理局的基础上于去年7月1日成立的，这个飞行集体已安全飞行了34年，并拥有100多名安全飞行1万小时以上的“全天侯”优秀飞行员，是全国最大的一家骨干航空运输企业。
    徐柏龄总裁向我介绍说：两个机组的成员李长信、王凤全、徐修开、江平、赵松乐、符重文同志中，李长信是我们公司的副总裁，是我国第一架波音—747400大型客机的首任机长。
    今年49岁的李长信，身材魁伟，年富力强，已安全飞行12000多小时，现在既担任公司的领导工作，又坚持国际航线上的航班飞行任务，肩上的担子相当繁重，是一名优秀的“全天侯”机长。李长信是辽宁省新民县人，至今还是纯朴的家乡口音。他告诉我：他是1958年进入航空学校的，三年的紧张学习生活使他掌握了“运五”飞机的驾驶技术。后来驾驶过伊尔—14、伊尔—18、波音—707、波音—747200大型客机，担任过副中队长、中队长、副大队长、大队长职务，1987年担任总队长，去年开始担任中国国际航空公司的副总裁。
    万里蓝天，鹰击长空。30年的飞行生活中，李长信驾驶国内和国际航班，驾驶首长专机，飞遍了全中国，飞遍了全世界。今年初，李长信带领4个机组12名成员去美国西雅图波音公司学习驾驶波音—747400大型客机的任务。这种飞机可载客297人，载货量近80吨，而飞行人员却由5人减为3人。这个“庞然大物”从外表上看和波音—747200差不多，但是它的座舱设备全部采用了电子飞行仪表，起飞、着陆、航线上飞行全都可以自动化。李长信说：我们这8名飞行员和4名通讯员（也称观察员）虽然都是精心挑选出来的尖子，但在训练中谁都不敢马虎，学习特别认真，严格要求自己。美国人每周只工作5天，我们7天，连春节都没有休息。我们住在旅馆里常把座舱图表贴在墙上，我们坐在沙发上或者躺在床上双眼总是紧紧盯住座舱图表学习到深夜。我们记呀，背呀，目的是要力争早一天掌握这一新机种的先进技术。经过理论学习和模拟机飞行，李长信一行终于以优异成绩获得了美方颁发的理论课和模拟机训练的两个合格证，单飞成绩优秀。美国教员给他们的评语是：中国人最守纪律，学习最用功，飞行成绩最好。波音公司的销售副总裁乔尔顿特地向李长信赠送一架飞机模型以示祝贺，并祝愿中美间友谊长存。
