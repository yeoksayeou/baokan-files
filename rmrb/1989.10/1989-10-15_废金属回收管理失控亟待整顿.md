Scrap metal is an indispensable raw material for industrial and agricultural production. China has vast potential in scrap metal resources, with an annual total resource volume of approximately 3400 million tons, ranking fourth in the world after the Soviet Union, the United States, and Japan. Currently, the amount of scrap steel produced annually accounts for about half of the annual steel production; scrap copper and aluminum account for about 36% of copper and aluminum production. Fully utilizing these scrap metals can achieve multiple benefits and play a crucial role in addressing the current shortage of raw materials. According to relevant departments, if the recycling work is well-managed, the supply and demand of domestic metal resources can be basically balanced. Therefore, people refer to metal recycling as "secondary metallurgy" or the "second mining industry."

Before 1987, scrap metal was listed as a state-planned material, managed and purchased by the state through the materials and commerce departments. After being deregulated in 1987, due to the lack of coordinated measures, management became chaotic:

First, multiple entities are involved in the business. According to statistics from the public security and commerce departments in Huangshi, Hubei, in addition to the materials and commerce departments, there are 198 other entities involved in scrap metal recycling, including administrative departments such as the municipal economic commission, municipal civil affairs bureau, and street offices. As for individual businesses, preliminary statistics show nearly 2000. Some places even have black markets for trading scrap metal.

Second, prices are being driven up. Due to the involvement of multiple entities in scrap metal, the value of scrap metal is increasing daily. The price of scrap steel has risen from 300 yuan per ton to 600 yuan. High-quality scrap steel has risen to 800-900 yuan per ton. With high prices for good scrap steel, everyone is competing for it, and no one wants the inferior scrap (steel shavings, thin materials). Nationwide, 3200 million tons of recyclable resources are available, but only 2700 million tons are recycled, resulting in a waste of 500 million tons.

Third, criminals are damaging production and public facilities. In just the first 11 months of 1988, the Zhongyuan Oilfield reported 450 cases of theft and damage to production equipment, with 2045 tons of stolen special metal materials, causing direct economic losses of hundreds of millions of yuan. In 1988, there were 1299 cases of damage to postal and telecommunications lines nationwide, with 920,000 meters of stolen cables.

To address the chaotic situation caused by unregulated management and multiple entities, relevant departments call for:

— The materials department to take the lead, in conjunction with public security, commerce, taxation, pricing, and commerce departments, to form an inspection team to immediately clean up and rectify the scrap metal market and operating entities. Re-examine business licenses; for entities applying to operate in scrap metal, the materials department must review them, the public security department must issue a permit, and the commerce administration department must approve and issue a business license, strictly prohibiting unlicensed operations.

— Strictly prohibit the purchase of scrap metal materials from individuals in sectors such as railways, petroleum, communications, and municipal utilities. For individuals who collect production-related metals, purchases must be made at designated points with strict certification.

— Enact regulations for the management of scrap materials, bringing the scrap metal market under legal regulation.

— Severely crack down on criminals involved in the theft, concealment, and illegal sale of scrap metal, bringing them to justice without leniency.

    废金属回收管理失控亟待整顿
    本报记者　刘燮阳
    废金属是工农业生产不可缺少的原料。我国废金属资源潜力巨大，年总资源量约3400万吨，仅次于苏联、美国和日本，居世界第四位。现在每年产生的废钢铁，约占年钢产量的一半；杂铜和废铝约占铜铝产量的36％。充分利用好这些废金属，一举多得，对解决当前原材料不足可起到十分重要的作用。据有关部门测算，如果回收工作搞得好，国内金属资源供需基本可以平衡。因此，人们把金属再生称为
  “二次冶金”或“第二矿业”。
    1987年以前，废金属一直被列为国家统配物资，由国家统一管理，物资、商业部门收购。1987年放开以后，由于措施不配套，管理混乱：
    第一，多家经营。据湖北黄石市的公安、工商部门统计，除物资和商业两家回收废金属外，另有经营单位198家，甚至连行政部门的市经委、市民政局、街道办事处等都兴办回收企业。至于个体户，初步统计，也有近2000家。一些地方还出现了交易废金属的黑市。
    第二，哄抬价格。由于多家染指废金属，废金属身价与日俱增。废钢价格由每吨300元涨到600元。好的废钢涨到800—900元。好废钢价格高，大家抢好废钢，次的（钢铁屑、轻薄料）无人收。全国可回收资源3200万吨，只回收2700万吨，浪费500万吨。
    第三，不法分子破坏生产建设和公用设施。仅1988年1月到11月，中原油田就发生盗窃破坏生产设备案件450起，被盗的专用金属材料达2045吨，直接经济损失高达数百万元。1988年，全国破坏邮电线路案件高达1299起，被盗割电线92万多米。
    为了解决管理失控、多头经营造成的混乱状况，有关部门呼吁：
    ——由物资部门牵头，会同公安、工商、税务、物价、商业等部门组成检查机构，立即对废金属市场和经营单位进行清理整顿。重新核查营业执照；对申请经营废金属的单位必须由物资部门审核，公安部门发给特许证，工商行政管理部门批准后发给营业执照，严禁无照经营。
    ——严禁从个人手中收购铁路、石油、通讯、市政公用等废旧金属材料，对个人拣拾的生产性金属，必须设专点严格凭证收购。
    ——颁布废旧物资管理法规，将废金属市场管理纳入法制轨道。
    ——严厉打击盗窃、窝赃、销赃、非法倒卖废旧金属的犯罪分子，绳之以法，绝不手软。
