Pingyuan Pharmaceutical Factory in our city is a provincial-level key enterprise with assets worth tens of millions of yuan and annual profits of nearly one billion yuan. However, this factory has serious fire hazards.

The chemical warehouse within the factory stores over 20 types of highly flammable and explosive materials, including butyl acetate, alcohol, and toluene, totaling more than 500 tons. The warehouse is located 8 meters east of a third-class civilian building and adjacent to a major road and multi-story buildings to the south. In the event of a fire, not only will production be disrupted, but the lives of residents will also be severely threatened.

The oil storage facilities in the western part of the factory are rudimentary. During the summer, the sun heats the oil drums to the point where they crackle. Relevant personnel have to spray water to cool them down. Large amounts of flammable and explosive liquids flow into the factory's drainage system. If a fire occurs outside the factory, the flames could spread back into the factory area through the drainage system.

The fire department has been issuing rectification opinions and major fire hazard notices to the factory since 1984, but the problems remain unresolved.

### 火灾隐患太严重  平原药厂快解决

　　火灾隐患太严重
　　平原药厂快解决
    我市平原制药厂是拥有数千万元资产的省直属重点企业，年盈利近亿元。但这家厂火灾隐患相当严重。
    厂化工仓库内混存着大量的丁酯、酒精、甲苯等易燃易爆物品20多种，总量达500多吨。库房东侧8米处是三级民用建筑，南侧毗邻主要公路和楼层建筑。一旦发生火灾，不仅生产受阻，居民的生命安全也将受到严重威胁。
    西厂区汽油库设施简陋，每到夏季，太阳把油桶晒得噼啪作响，有关人员只好在夏天喷水降温，大量易燃易爆药液流入厂里的下水道，一旦厂外发生火情，火苗将会顺着下水道回窜厂区。
    消防部门早在1984年就对这个厂提出了整改意见，并多次下发重大火灾隐患通知书，但问题一直得不到解决。
