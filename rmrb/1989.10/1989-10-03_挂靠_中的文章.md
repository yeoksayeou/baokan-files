Recently, during tax inspections across various regions, it was discovered that some enterprises, which were ostensibly state-owned or collectively owned, were actually privately run or individual businesses. These entities used this tactic to enjoy tax exemptions and reductions. In Hunan's Xiangtan, there were over 1,000 such cases, and in Chengdu, more than 1,900 cases were uncovered. In Shenyang, 4,700 fake collective enterprises emerged in 1987 and 1988, and preliminary investigations revealed that they evaded over 15 million yuan in taxes.

The ownership and profit distribution of private enterprises and individual businesses are fundamentally different from those of state-owned and collectively owned enterprises. To change the nature of ownership on paper, these private enterprises and individual businesses "hang" themselves on relevant units or state-owned and collectively owned enterprises. The units that are "hung" on can then collect hanging fees and management fees, and some openly sign contracts to share in the profits, adding this as an off-budget income at the end of the year. The cost of "hanging" for private enterprises or individual businesses is far less than the taxes they should pay. Although the units that are "hung" on gain advantages, they shelter tax evasion and lose the policies and principles that state agencies or state-owned enterprises should uphold.

Private enterprises and individual businesses consider "hanging" on a unit as entering a safe deposit box. They can open multiple accounts in banks to withdraw cash; they can sell substandard goods and engage in buying and selling for profit.

The phenomenon of fake state-owned and fake collective but real individual businesses is also related, to some extent, to certain departments imposing arbitrary levies and charges on individual businesses. Some individual businesses, unable to bear the burden, "hang" themselves on a unit to change their signboard, hoping to escape the troubles of arbitrary levies and charges. This reminds relevant departments that it is necessary to seriously consider and rectify the behavior of arbitrary levies and charges, providing individual businesses with a good external environment for self-development. The phenomenon of fake state-owned and fake collective but real individual businesses also exposes the negligence of the industrial and commercial management departments in their registration work. Currently, some cities' industrial and commercial departments are conducting a thorough cleanup and rectification of the registration work of industrial and commercial enterprises and individual businesses. This is very necessary. More importantly, in the future, when examining industrial and commercial registrations and issuing business licenses, it is crucial to strictly distinguish whether an enterprise is state-owned, collectively owned, or an individual business, without any ambiguity or favoritism.

    “挂靠”中的文章
    吉荫桐
    各地最近在税收大检查中，发现有些挂着全民、集体牌子的企业，原来是私人办的企业，或是个体工商户。他们用此手法享受着减免税的优惠。湖南湘潭这类事不下1000起，成都市已查出1900多起。沈阳市1987年和1988年出现4700家假集体企业，据初步了解，少向国家交税1500多万元。
    私人企业和个体户的资产占有、利润分配，跟全民、集体企业根本不同，他们为了在名义上变更所有制的性质，挂靠到有关单位或全民、集体企业。而被挂靠的单位则可借此机会收取挂靠费、管理费，有的公然订合同，参与利润分配，年终作为一笔计划外收入装进自己的小金库。私人企业或个体户有了挂靠单位，所付出的酬谢远比应交的税额少得多。被挂靠的单位虽捞到了便宜，但庇护了偷漏税行为，丢掉了国家机关或国营企业应有的政策原则。
    私人企业和个体户把挂靠到某个单位看成是进了保险柜，在银行可多头开户，套取现金；推销伪劣商品，倒买倒卖。
    假全民、假集体、真个体现象的出现，在一定程度上也和某些方面对个体户乱摊派、乱收费有关。有些个体户招架不住了，便挂靠到某个单位，变更一下牌子，希冀摆脱乱摊派乱收费的困扰。这也就提醒了有关部门，坚决纠正乱摊派乱收费的行为，为个体户提供自我发展的良好的外部条件，是很需要认真考虑的。假全民、假集体、真个体现象的出现，也暴露了工商管理部门对登记工作的疏漏。现在，有些城市的工商部门结合工商企业与个体户的换照工作，逐一认真清理、纠正。这很有必要。更重要的是今后在审查工商登记、颁发营业执照时，是全民、集体，还是个体，要严格审查，不能含糊，不能徇私。
