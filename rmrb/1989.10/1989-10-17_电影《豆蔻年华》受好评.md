The Propaganda Department's Bureau of Literature and Art and the Bureau of Education held a symposium in Beijing today to enthusiastically recommend this children's film to society.

"The Years of Bliss" portrays a group of female high school students, young teachers, and young people who failed the college entrance examination in a key middle school, reflecting their understanding and pursuit of life's value in the new era of social change.
