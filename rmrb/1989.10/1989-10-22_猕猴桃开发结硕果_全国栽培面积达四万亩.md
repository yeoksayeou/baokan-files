Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 22nd.

After a decade of effort, China's kiwifruit development and production have entered a new stage of commercial production.

Known as the "King of Fruits," kiwifruit is currently one of the most popular fruits in the world. In recent years, the state has invested nearly 8 million yuan, with the Ministry of Agriculture taking the lead in establishing 18 kiwifruit base counties in 10 provinces and cities with advantageous kiwifruit resources. Currently, China's cultivated area for kiwifruit has reached 40,000 acres, with an annual production of over 2 million kilograms. Since 1986, the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse has replaced imported New Zealand kiwifruit with domestically produced ones. Fresh fruits from Hubei and Shaanxi are also very popular in Singapore and Hong Kong.

    被誉为“水果之王”的猕猴桃，是当前世界上的热门水果。近几年，国家投资近800万元，由农业部具体组织，在有猕猴桃资源优势的10个省市建立了18个猕猴桃基地县。目前，我国人工栽培的面积已达4万亩，年产200多万公斤。从1986年起，钓鱼台国宾馆已用国产猕猴桃代替了新西兰进口的猕猴桃。湖北、陕西的鲜果在新加坡、香港也很畅销。
