In Paris, people refer to the act of indiscriminate scribbling and painting as "graffiti." This behavior has become a cultural plague in society.

In public places, especially in subway stations, you often see the following phenomena: on beautiful benches and seats, on subway route maps or station name signs, on street sculptures and billboards, on the walls of old or modern buildings, on the embankments of the Seine River... there are strings and piles of bizarre "texts" sprayed with colorful paints or written with oil pastels, which are quite eye-catching. This graffiti behavior has caused Paris city authorities a lot of headaches.

Graffiti is highly destructive. A few careless strokes can cause thousands of francs in damage. If not cleaned, it looks unsightly, and cleaning requires funds, and soon new graffiti will appear. According to reports, the Paris city authorities organize people to paint and cover up graffiti every year. In 1985, the area covered was 32,000 square meters, in 1987 it was 102,000 square meters, and in the first five months of 1988 it had already reached 51,000 square meters. The cost of cleaning is also quite high. In 1986, the subway system alone spent 14 million francs, and this year it may reach 35 million francs.

Who are these graffiti artists? According to a friend, they are mostly teenagers in their teens and twenties, many of whom are students. A significant number are children from single-parent families after their parents' divorce. They are mentally empty, bored, and consider this random scribbling and painting as "art." What they often write are their own unique signatures or the abbreviations of their gang names. They use this method to show their existence everywhere.

According to research by relevant experts, graffiti is an international social phenomenon. As early as more than ten years ago, the New York subway was hit by a "graffiti" storm. In recent years, it has spread from the surface to the underground in Paris.

The subway company regards the fight against graffiti artists as a "war." In 1986, the police caught five or six hundred people in the subway, and last year they caught more than 500 people. They also make the caught graffiti artists participate in covering up the polluted walls.

Moreover, anti-graffiti mesh paint and thinners have been invented. However, these measures alone may not be able to eradicate such a socially pathological behavior as graffiti.

    巴黎的“涂鸦”者
    魏玉琴
    在巴黎，人们把那些到处乱涂乱画的行为斥之为“涂鸦”。这种行为已成了社会的一种文化灾害。
    在公共场所特别是在地铁站里，你常看到这样的现象：在漂亮的坐椅或长凳上，在地铁线路图或线路站名示意图上，在街头的雕塑和广告牌上，在古老或现代楼房的外墙上，在塞纳河畔的护墙上……，一串串、一堆堆用五颜六色的漆喷上或油彩笔写上稀奇古怪的“文字”赫然其上，十分刺眼。这种“涂鸦”行为使巴黎市政当局伤透了脑筋。
    “涂鸦”行为具有很大的破坏性。漫不经心的几笔乱涂足以造成几千法郎的损失，不清除不雅观，清除需要经费，而且不久又会出现新的。据报道，巴黎市政当局年年都组织人力粉刷和覆盖。1985年粉刷与覆盖的面积达3.2万平方米，1987年为10.2万平方米，1988年头5个月就已达5.1万平方米。清除所需的费用也相当高，1986年，仅地铁系统就耗资1400万法郎，今年可能要达到3500万法郎。
    “涂鸦”者是些什么人呢？据一位朋友介绍，这是一些十几岁、二十岁的青少年，大多是中学生，有不少是父母离异后单亲家庭的孩子。他们思想空虚，百无聊赖，视这种乱涂乱画为“艺术”。他们涂画的多是他们自己特定的签名或团伙名称的缩写。他们以这种方式到处显示自己的存在。
    据有关专家研究发现，“涂鸦”是一种带有国际性的社会现象。早在十多年前，纽约地铁就刮过“涂鸦”风。近年，在巴黎从地上蔓延到地下。
    地铁公司的人把与“涂鸦”者作斗争视为一场“战争”。1986年，警察在地铁就抓获五、六百人，去年又抓获500多人，并且让被抓获的“涂鸦”者去参加覆盖污染了的墙壁。
    另外，还发明了反涂写的网膜清漆和稀释液。然而，单仅凭这些手段恐怕是不能根除“涂鸦”这样一种社会病态行为的。
