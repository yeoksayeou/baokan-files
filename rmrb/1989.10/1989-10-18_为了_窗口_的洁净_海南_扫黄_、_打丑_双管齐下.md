On September 23rd, the secretaries, mayors, propaganda department heads, cultural bureau directors, radio and television bureau directors, and the heads of public security, procuratorate, and courts from various cities and counties in Hainan Province were all summoned to Haikou City to attend a provincial "clean-up yellow" work conference. This "one-stick-through" approach was the first of its kind since Hainan became a province.

People in Hainan began to realize the harm that "yellow harm" was causing to the reputation of this, the largest special economic zone in China.

Provincial Party Secretary Xu Shijie personally delivered a speech at the conference to mobilize the "clean-up yellow" efforts. He enumerated the ten major harms of yellow and obscene materials: first, they corrupt social morals; second, they endanger social stability; third, they tarnish the reputation of reform and opening up; fourth, they lower national quality; fifth, they corrupt people's souls; sixth, they hinder the cultivation of talent; seventh, they affect the healthy growth of young people; eighth, they are silent killers; ninth, they are accomplices in peaceful evolution; and tenth, they are public nuisances that induce crime. Governor Liu Jianfeng also attended the meeting and spoke. The provincial leadership was anxious: Hainan's "clean-up yellow" work still had a significant gap compared to the requirements of the Party Central Committee. Some comrades' understanding was still superficial, the masses had not been fully mobilized, and the work was not thorough enough.

Local officials returned to their respective regions with the five aspects of policy measures formulated at the meeting. The province also dispatched three inspection teams to supervise and inspect the progress of the "clean-up yellow" efforts across the island. In the short period before National Day, the province organized more than 7,000 officials from relevant departments and public security activists to clean up and rectify the book and magazine markets, audio-visual markets, and entertainment venues. Several large-scale "clean-up yellow" actions were organized. The province also confiscated nearly 10,000 copies of yellow books, magazines, and illegal publications, confiscated 670 boxes of yellow videotapes, and shut down 191 video playback points. Provincial leaders such as Xu Shijie and Liu Jianfeng personally inspected key "clean-up yellow" units in Haikou City. The city's leadership, after researching and analyzing the city's "yellow situation," "yellow sources," "yellow harms," and "blind spots," quickly took action, confiscating a large number of yellow books and magazines and yellow videotapes, and publicly destroying them in the city's People's Square. In the southern coastal city of Sanya, a special meeting was held with the participation of relevant departments such as customs and border defense to deploy "blocking yellow" work at sea and strengthen inspections of incoming ships. With the province-wide "clean-up yellow" efforts underway, various cities and counties are organizing forces to expedite the handling of "clean-up yellow" cases.

Some ugly social phenomena that have emerged in this, the youngest province in China, have long been criticized. Hainan Province has paid attention to combining "clean-up yellow" with "strike ugly." Haikou City has confiscated 21,785 copies of banned books and magazines, 2,828 videotapes, and shut down 21 unlicensed book and magazine stalls this year. At the same time, it has handled 139 cases of prostitution, punished 276 people, and shut down 15 sauna baths, mixed-gender massage parlors, and other sex-related venues. Sanya City, while "cleaning up yellow," has handled 66 cases of prostitution and solicitation, shut down 24 sex-related dens, uncovered 6 prostitution gangs, and handled 45 cases of gambling, punishing a total of 226 people. At the same time, Hainan Province has also cleaned up hotels, inns, roadside shops, cafes, and dance halls. The combined efforts of "clean-up yellow" and "strike ugly" have significantly improved the cultural market and social order.

To strengthen public security management, the provincial government on September 13th forwarded the regulations of the provincial public security bureau and the industrial and commercial administration bureau on strengthening the public security management of sauna and massage businesses.

As a window to the outside world, Hainan's "clean-up yellow" work is relatively difficult, but the people of Hainan have taken action. They understand that whether this work can be carried out in depth is indeed related to the reputation of reform and opening up!

    为了“窗口”的洁净
    ——海南“扫黄”、“打丑”双管齐下
    周昭先
    9月23日，海南省各市县的书记、市（县）长、宣传部长、文化局长、广播电视局长、公检法三长被一道召到海口市，出席全省“扫黄”工作会议。这种“一竿子插到底”的办法，在海南建省以来还是第一次。
    海南人开始意识到“黄害”对我国这个最大特区的声誉的危害。
    省委书记许士杰亲自在会议上作“扫黄”动员，他历数黄色淫秽物品的十大危害：一是污染社会风气，二是危害社会安定，三是败坏改革开放的声誉，四是降低民族素质，五是腐蚀人们灵魂，六是妨碍人才的培养，七是影响青少年的健康成长，八是不拿刀枪的杀手，九是和平演变的帮凶，十是诱发犯罪的公害。省长刘剑锋也参加了会议并讲了话。省里着急了：海南的“扫黄”工作同党中央的要求还有较大差距，一些同志的认识还较肤浅，群众还没有充分发动起来，工作还不够深入彻底。
    地方官们带着会议制订的5个方面的政策措施回到各地。省里又派出3个检查组巡查督促全岛的“扫黄”进展情况。在国庆节前夕短短几天里，全省组织了各有关部门干部和治安积极分子7000多人，对书报刊市场、音像市场和娱乐场所进行清理和整顿，连续组织了几次较大规模的“扫黄”行动。全省又收缴黄色书报刊和非法出版物近1万册，收缴黄色录像带670盒，取缔录像播放点191个。许士杰、刘剑锋等省领导亲自到“扫黄”重点单位海口市进行检查。这个市的领导机关在研究分析全市的“黄情”、“黄源”、“黄害”以及“死角”后，很快采取行动，收缴大批黄色书刊和黄色录像带，在市人民广场当众销毁。在南部滨海城市三亚，还专门召开了有海关、边防等有关部门参加的会议，部署海上“堵黄”工作，加强对外来船只的稽查。随着全省“扫黄”的展开，各市县还在组织力量，加紧办理“扫黄”案件。
    这个我国最年轻的省份出现的某些丑恶的社会现象一直为人所诟病。海南省注意把“扫黄”和“打丑”结合起来。海口市今年以来，收缴违禁书刊21785册，录像带2828盒，取缔无照经营书刊点21个，同时查处卖淫139宗，处罚276人，取缔桑拿浴、异性按摩院等色情场所15家。三亚市在“扫黄”的同时，查处卖淫、嫖宿66起，取缔色情窝点24个，挖出6个卖淫团伙，查获赌博45起，共处罚226人。与此同时，海南省还对宾馆、旅店、路边店、咖啡厅、歌舞厅进行了清理。“扫黄”和“打丑”双管齐下，使文化市场和社会秩序有了明显的好转。
    为了加强治安管理，省政府9月13日转发了省公安厅、工商局《关于加强桑拿按摩业治安管理的规定》。
    作为对外开放的窗口，海南的“扫黄”工作难度较大，但海南人毕竟行动起来了。他们明白，这项工作能否深入进行下去，确确实实关系到改革开放的声誉呵！
