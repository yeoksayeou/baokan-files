Purple Mountain Observatory has discovered three new asteroids, which have recently been officially named by the international community. Asteroid 2789 is named "Foshan"; asteroid 3024 is named "Hainan"; and asteroid 3048 is named "Guangzhou."

According to international conventions, the names of new asteroids are proposed by the discoverers. Based on the suggestions from Purple Mountain Observatory, the International Astronomical Union and the Naming Committee discussed and approved the names of these celestial bodies, and the names have been announced to astronomical observatories around the world.

The asteroid exploration and discovery work at Purple Mountain Observatory was initiated by the late renowned astronomer Zhang Yuzhe. In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, the Planetary Research Room of Purple Mountain Observatory has discovered 102 new asteroids that have been assigned international permanent numbers and have the right to be named. Previously, they had named many asteroids using the names of Chinese provinces, cities, and ancient astronomers.

    紫金山天文台发现三颗小行星分别命名“佛山”“海南”“广州”
    据新华社南京10月7日电　中国科学院紫金山天文台发现的新小行星中，最近又有3颗获得国际正式命名。第2789号小行星命名为“佛山”；第3024号小行星命名为“海南”；第3048号小行星命名为“广州”。
    按照国际惯例，新小行星的名字由发现者提出命名的参考意见。根据紫金山天文台的提议，国际小行星中心和命名委员会讨论并通过了上述天体的命名，并已通告全世界各天文台。
    紫金山天文台的小行星探索发现工作，是由已故著名天文学家张钰哲开创的。建国40年来，紫金山天文台行星研究室先后发现了获得国际永久编号并拥有命名权的新小行星102颗。在此之前，他们曾用我国省、市地方名字和古代天文学家名字命名了许多小行星。
