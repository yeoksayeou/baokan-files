Central People's Broadcasting Station today aired a segment from a speech given by CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin during his early August inspection of Shanghai in their recorded agricultural series "Deep Affection for the Yellow Earth." Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the guideline of putting agriculture first and called for the entire Party, the nation, and all sectors to work together to improve agriculture.

Jiang Zemin places great importance on the development of agriculture. In July, he inspected Hubei; in August, Shanghai; and in September, Shaanxi. In each place, he paid attention to understanding the agricultural situation and studying agricultural issues. The agricultural series "Deep Affection for the Yellow Earth" recorded by Central People's Broadcasting Station included a discussion by Jiang Zemin on agricultural issues during his inspection of Shanghai.

Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech: The issue of feeding 1.1 billion people is the biggest problem. Food is the most important thing for people. Not only the food problem, but also the clothing problem. Grain, cotton, and other industrial raw materials all need to be solved by agriculture. We have a Chinese saying: Every bowl of porridge and every meal should remind us of its hardships, and every thread and every piece of cloth should remind us of the difficulty of obtaining materials. In the 40 years since the founding of New China, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, agriculture has undergone historic changes and achieved great successes. The broad masses of farmers have made arduous efforts. Now, generally speaking, the agricultural foundation is still relatively weak, with very little arable land per capita. In our country, there is only about 1 mu of land per capita, while in the United States there is 15 mu per capita, and in Canada there is 30 mu per capita. Our yield per mu and labor productivity are still relatively low, and there are various difficulties. This is our basic national condition. We need to conduct national conditions education, that is, to let the whole nation understand these situations. We must adhere to the guideline of putting agriculture first, develop and promote scientific and technological advancements, increase agricultural investment, and make the best use of the existing arable land. The key is that the entire Party, the nation, and all sectors must pay attention to agriculture, pay attention to the development of agricultural-related industries to support agriculture, and work together to improve our agriculture.

The agricultural series "Deep Affection for the Yellow Earth" consists of 8 episodes, which will be broadcast consecutively for 8 days starting from October 3 in the "Half Hour at Noon" and "Joint Broadcast of Local People's Radio Stations" programs. The audio recording of Jiang Zemin's speech will be broadcast in the first episode.

"Deep Affection for the Yellow Earth" uses a large amount of audio and rich materials to enthusiastically sing the praises of the great achievements made in China's agriculture over the past 40 years, extol the merits of the 10-year agricultural reform, and analyze the national conditions, exploring together the path of developing socialist agriculture with Chinese characteristics. The titles of the 8 episodes are: "An Indissoluble Bond," "The Decade of Reform That Attracted World Attention," "Science and Technology for Agricultural Development," "The Symphony of Grain," "The Call of the Land," "The Rise of Township Enterprises," "United Efforts to Support Agriculture," and "The Field of Hope."

    江泽民总书记在一次讲话中强调
    坚持以农业为基础的指导思想
    全党全国各行各业齐心协力把农业搞得更好
    新华社北京10月3日电　中央人民广播电台今天在他们录制的《深情的黄土地》农业系列报道中，播发了中共中央总书记江泽民8月初视察上海时的一段讲话。江泽民同志强调坚持以农业为基础的指导思想，要求全党全国、各行各业齐心协力，把农业搞得更好。
    江泽民同志很重视农业的发展。他7月视察湖北，8月视察上海，9月视察陕西，每到一地都注意了解农业情况，研究农业问题。中央人民广播电台录制的农业系列报道《深情的黄土地》采用了江泽民同志视察上海时就农业问题发表的谈话。
    江泽民在谈话中指出：11亿人口吃饭的问题，是最大的问题。民以食为天。不仅吃饭问题，还有穿衣问题。粮食、棉花以及其他一些工业原料，都要靠农业解决。我们中国有句俗话：一粥一饭当思来之不易，半丝半缕恒念物力维艰。新中国成立40年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，农业发生了历史性变化，取得了很大成绩，广大农民付出了艰苦努力。现在，总的说农业这个基础还比较薄弱，人均耕地很少，我国人均只有1亩多地，美国人均15亩，加拿大人均30亩。我们的亩产量以及劳动生产率都还比较低，还存在着这样那样的一些困难。这是我们基本的国情。要进行国情教育，就是要让全国人民了解这些情况。我们要坚持农业为基础的指导思想，发展并推广科学技术，增加农业投入，最大限度地利用好现有的耕地。关键是，全党全国，各行各业，都要重视农业，要重视发展农用工业来支持农业，齐心协力，把我们的农业搞得更好。
    农业系列报道《深情的黄土地》共分8集，从10月3日起，连续8天在《午间半小时》和《各地人民广播电台联播节目》中播出。江泽民同志的讲话录音在第1集中广播。
    《深情的黄土地》运用大量音响和丰富素材，热情讴歌了40年来我国农业所取得的伟大成就，颂扬了10年农业改革的功绩，并分析国情，同大家一起探讨具有中国特色的社会主义农业的发展之路。8集的题目分别是：《不解之缘》、《举世瞩目的改革10年》、《科技兴农》、《粮食奏鸣曲》、《土地的呼唤》、《异军突起的乡镇企业》、《同心协力支援农业》、《希望的田野》。
