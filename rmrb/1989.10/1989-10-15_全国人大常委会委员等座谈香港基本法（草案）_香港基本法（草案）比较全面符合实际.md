Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 14th.

The Secretariat of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee held a seminar on the Hong Kong Basic Law (Draft) today at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The seminar aimed to gather opinions from NPC Standing Committee members, members of the NPC Legal Affairs Committee, and members of the Foreign Affairs Committee who are currently in Beijing.

The seminar was chaired by Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and Vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee. Li Hou, Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and Secretary-General of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, briefed the attendees on the situation regarding the solicitation of opinions on the Basic Law (Draft) since its release. Over 40 committee members attended the seminar, focusing their discussions on the relationship between the central government and the special administrative region, as well as the political system of the special administrative region.

The committee members generally agreed that the Hong Kong Basic Law (Draft) is relatively comprehensive and practical. It reflects China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997 while maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability under the capitalist system. The provisions of the Basic Law (Draft) are generally reasonable and should not be subject to major revisions.

The committee members believe that some individuals in Britain and Hong Kong are attempting to exert pressure on the Basic Law Drafting Committee by taking advantage of China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. They propose that China should not station troops in Hong Kong after 1997, that the power to declare a "state of emergency" should belong to Hong Kong, and that the interpretation of the Basic Law should be vested in Hong Kong. These proposals are seen as infringements on China's sovereignty. The committee members emphasized that the number of troops stationed and the decision to station troops are purely internal affairs of China and should not be interfered with by anyone. One member pointed out that even the British have troops stationed in Hong Kong, so it is only natural for China to station troops in Hong Kong, which is the gateway to the south. If we follow some people's suggestions and do not station troops in Hong Kong, how can the central government maintain sovereignty over Hong Kong if the local government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has the power to declare a "state of emergency" and the interpretation of the Basic Law belongs entirely to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region? This would not be "one country, two systems" but "two countries, two systems." The committee members believe that these fundamental issues cannot be compromised.

Some committee members stated that "one country, two systems" is our established policy. The drafting of the Basic Law ensures that Hong Kong people can continue to do business under capitalist competition and hopes that they will do even better.

Regarding the political system, the committee members generally agreed that China hopes for Hong Kong compatriots to enjoy democracy, but democracy should be gradual. Otherwise, the resulting turmoil would harm the interests of most Hong Kong compatriots.

Some committee members suggested adding clauses to the Basic Law to absolutely prohibit foreign interference in Hong Kong after its return to the motherland in 1997, including using Hong Kong as a base to oppose the central government.

This round of soliciting opinions is the final one for the Hong Kong Basic Law (Draft). The Third Session of the Seventh NPC, scheduled for March next year, will review and adopt the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law.

Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, Lei Jieqiong, attended the seminar.

    全国人大常委会委员等座谈香港基本法（草案）
    香港基本法（草案）比较全面符合实际
    新华社北京10月14日电（记者黄日尧）香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会秘书处今天在北京人民大会堂举行关于香港基本法（草案）的座谈会，听取在京全国人大常委会委员、全国人大法律委员会和外事委员会委员对基本法（草案）的意见。
    座谈会由全国人大常委会副委员长、香港基本法起草委员会副主任委员王汉斌主持，国务院港澳办公室副主任、香港基本法起草委员会秘书长李后向委员们介绍了基本法（草案）征求意见以来的情况。出席座谈会的40多位委员着重就中央与特别行政区的关系以及特别行政区的政治体制等问题进行了讨论。
    委员们普遍认为，香港基本法（草案）是比较全面、比较符合实际的，它既体现了1997年以后中国对香港恢复行使主权，又维护了资本主义制度下香港的繁荣与稳定。基本法（草案）的条文基本上是合情合理的，不宜再作大的改动。
    委员们认为，英国和香港有些人利用中国平息北京反革命暴乱企图向基本法起草委员会施加压力，提出1997年以后中国不能在香港驻军以及宣布
  “紧急状态”和基本法的解释权应属香港等主张，这是对中国主权的侵犯。委员们认为，如何驻军、驻军多少，完全是中国的内政，任何人都不能干涉。一位委员说，英国人尚且在香港驻军，何况香港是中国的南大门，我们驻军香港是为了巩固国防，这是顺理成章的事。如果按照有些人的提法，不在香港驻军，作为地方政府的香港特别行政区又有权宣布“紧急状态”，基本法的“解释权”完全属于香港特别行政区，中国对香港还有什么主权？这样就不是“一国两制”，而是“两国两制”了。委员们认为这些原则性问题是不能让步的。
    有的委员说，“一国两制”是我们既定的政策，基本法的制定，不但保证香港人能够在资本主义的竞争条件下继续做生意，并希望他们做得更好。
    至于政治体制问题，委员们普遍认为，中国希望香港同胞享有民主，但民主是循序渐进的，否则由此而产生的动荡将会损害大多数香港同胞的利益。
    还有的委员建议应考虑增加几条关于1997年香港回归祖国后绝对不准外国粗暴干涉包括香港在内的我国内政和把香港当作反对中央的基地的条款。
    这次征求意见活动是香港基本法（草案）最后一次征求意见。明年3月召开的七届人大三次会议将审议并通过香港特别行政区基本法。
    人大常委会副委员长、香港基本法起草委员会委员雷洁琼出席了座谈会。
