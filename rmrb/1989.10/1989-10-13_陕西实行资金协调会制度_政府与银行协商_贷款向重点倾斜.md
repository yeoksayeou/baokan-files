Shaanxi, a province where large and medium-sized enterprises account for a significant proportion, has taken the lead in implementing the fund coordination meeting system, guided by industrial policies. The system aims to provide preferential loans to key enterprises and products, achieving good results.

The fund coordination meeting is composed of three parties: the Provincial Government Office, the Provincial Economic Commission, and the Provincial Industrial and Commercial Bank. During each meeting, the Provincial Economic Commission reports on the progress of industrial production and economic development trends, and allocates the amount of funds urgently needed by enterprises. The bank reports on the use of credit funds and the available funds. After thorough consultation, the three parties jointly study and determine the focus of loan issuance and the plan for reduction.

The implementation of the fund coordination meeting system has strengthened the connection between the government and the banking business, ensuring that the state's industrial policies are effectively implemented. It has also accelerated the turnover of credit funds, gradually turning the fund turnover into a virtuous cycle. In the first half of this year, the province cumulatively issued industrial loans totaling 4.4 billion yuan, while the loan balance at the end of June increased by only 450 million yuan. The shortest loan term is 20 days, used for the "Push Housing" campaign to clear up triangular debts; the longest term is about two months, and loans are generally repaid on time.

    陕西实行资金协调会制度
    政府与银行协商　贷款向重点倾斜
    本报西安电　记者景险峰报道：大中型企业所占比重较大的陕西省以产业政策为导向，在国内较早地实行资金协调会制度，有目的地对骨干企业和重点产品执行倾斜贷款政策，收到较好效果。
    资金协调会由省府办公厅、省经委和省工商银行三方组成。每次例会，分别由省经委通报工业生产进度和经济发展的变化趋势，拨出企业急需资金的数额；由银行通报信贷资金使用情况和可用资金状况。三方经过充分协商，最后综合研究，确定贷款投放重点和压缩方案。
    实行资金协调会制度，密切了政府与银行业务的联系，促使国家的产业政策落到实处，同时加速了信贷资金周转，使资金周转逐步转向良性循环。今年上半年，全省累计发放工业贷款44亿元，而6月末贷款余额仅增加4.5亿元。贷款期限最短的20天，用于开展“推房子”清理三角债；期限最长的两个月左右，一般都能按期归还。
