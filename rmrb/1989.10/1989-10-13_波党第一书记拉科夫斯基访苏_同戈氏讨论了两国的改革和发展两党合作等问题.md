Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 11th.

The Soviet leader Gorbachev met with the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, Rakowski, on the 11th. The two sides discussed the social, economic, and political reforms currently underway in the Soviet Union and Poland, as well as the prospects for cooperation between the two parties and the future of Soviet-Polish relations.

Rakowski arrived in Moscow on the 10th for a working visit. This is the first visit to the Soviet Union by a Polish United Workers' Party leader since Mazowiecki became the Prime Minister of Poland.

According to reports, Rakowski briefed Gorbachev on the domestic situation in Poland following the parliamentary elections and the formation of the new government.

Both sides attach great importance to the future of Soviet-Polish relations and are convinced that the foundation of the two countries' relations will not be shaken by temporary political considerations. This foundation is the shared destiny and common geostrategic interests of the two countries. The party leaders believe that cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland within the framework of the Warsaw Pact is a major component of peace and stability in Europe.

After the meeting, Rakowski said at a press conference that Gorbachev understands the current situation in Poland, and both sides have consistent views on the issues discussed. They advocate further strengthening the ties between the parties, the two countries, and their peoples, and seeking new paths and forms of cooperation.

In response to questions from foreign journalists, the Polish leader believes that the West cannot provide Poland with substantial aid. If the current Polish government places its hopes on such aid, it would be a mistake. He emphasized that Poland can only rely on its own strength to overcome the current economic crisis.

    同戈氏讨论了两国的改革和发展两党合作等问题
    新华社莫斯科10月11日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫11日同波兰统一工人党中央第一书记拉科夫斯基进行了会晤，双方讨论了苏联和波兰正在发生的社会、经济和政治改革，发展两党的合作和苏波关系前景等问题。
    拉科夫斯基是10日抵达莫斯科做工作访问的。这是马佐维耶茨基任波兰政府总理后波兰统一工人党领导人首次访苏。
    据报道，拉科夫斯基向戈尔巴乔夫介绍了波兰国会选举和新政府组成后的国内局势。
    双方十分重视苏波关系前景，并确信，两国关系的基础将不因政治上的暂时考虑而动摇，这种基础就是两国有共同的命运和共同的地理战略利益。两党领导人认为，苏波在华沙条约范围内的协作，是欧洲和平与稳定的一个主要组成部分。
    会晤结束后，拉科夫斯基在记者招待会上说，戈尔巴乔夫对波兰当前的局势表示理解，双方对所讨论的问题看法一致，并主张进一步加强党、两国和人民之间的联系，寻找新的合作途径和形式。
    在回答外国记者的提问时，这位波兰领导人认为，西方不可能向波兰提供大量援助，如果波兰现政府将希望寄托在这种援助上，那将是一种错误。他强调，波兰只有靠自身的力量才能摆脱目前的经济危机。
