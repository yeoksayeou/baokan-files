	Nearly a month ago, reporters learned from a chart reflecting the latest situation of China's industrial economic layout that, after 40 years of construction, China's coastal and inland industrial economies are forming a new layout that is relatively reasonable in terms of production force allocation and regional development coordination.

	Factories stand on "virgin land." In China's inland regions, the vast lands that were once called industrial virgin lands now have factories and enterprises everywhere. In the desolate Great Northern Wilderness, the Daqing Oil Field was developed through self-reliance; in the rugged mountains of the southwest, the Panzhihua Steel Company and the Liupanshui Coal Base were built; on the turbulent Yellow River and Yangtze River, the Longyangxia Hydropower Station and the Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub were constructed. A number of new industrial bases have also emerged in inland regions. Statistics show that the industrial output value created by inland regions now accounts for about 40% of the national industrial output value.

	"Closed-off areas" with crisscrossing channels. In the past, transportation in the northwest and southwest was very inconvenient, seriously hindering economic development. After the founding of New China, large-scale railway and highway construction was immediately launched. After 40 years of effort, the Baocheng, Xiangqian, and Xiangyu railways connecting the northwest, southwest, and central-southern regions were completed. With the completion of the Chuanqian, Chengyu, Guikun, and Chengkun railways, the southwest provinces also have interconnected arteries. To connect the transportation in the northwest region, the Baolan, Tianlan, Lanzhou-Xinjiang, and Lanzhou-Qinghai railways were successively built, and the Nanjiang Railway was constructed in Xinjiang. The Jiao-Zhen and Zhen-Liu railways built in the hinterland added another important north-south passage to China. Now, the railway mileage west of the Jingguang Line has increased from 19.5% of the national total at the beginning of liberation to 45%. Road construction has also made great progress. Currently, except for Motuo County in Tibet, all counties have roads. The construction of the Sichuan-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet highways has greatly improved Tibet's transportation. The development of civil aviation is even more remarkable, with Chengdu, Kunming, and Urumqi having well-equipped civil airports.

	"One heavy end" gradually becomes "two balanced ends." In the early days of liberation, people referred to China's coastal and inland industrial layout as "one heavy end." Industry was mainly concentrated in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and a few other provinces and cities. The vast inland and border regions had very little industry, especially in the northwest, southwest, and Inner Mongolia regions, which account for nearly 70% of the national territory, where industry accounted for only about 10% of the national total. To change this unreasonable situation, New China implemented a "two balanced ends" policy in investment allocation for construction. Over the past 40 years, the state has invested more than 720 billion yuan in inland construction, accounting for 49% of the national total investment.

	Experts believe that the improvement of China's industrial economic layout has narrowed the economic development gap between inland and coastal regions, optimized the allocation of production forces, and is of great significance for promoting the stable and coordinated development of the national economy.

### 东部“一头沉”逐渐变成沿海内地“两头平”  我国工业布局日趋合理

    东部“一头沉”逐渐变成沿海内地“两头平”
    我国工业布局日趋合理
    据新华社北京10月8日电（记者徐耀中）近日记者从一份反映我国工业经济布局最新情况的图表发现，经过40年的建设，我国沿海与内地的工业经济正在形成生产力配置比较得当、地区发展比较协调的日趋合理的崭新布局。
    “处女地”上工厂林立。在我国的内陆地区，解放初被称为工业处女地的辽阔大地上，如今已是厂房林立、企业遍布。在渺无人烟的北大荒，自力更生开发出了大庆油田；在大西南的崇山峻岭间，建起了攀枝花钢铁公司和六盘水煤炭基地；在激流滚滚的黄河、长江上，兴建了龙羊峡水电站和葛洲坝水利枢纽等宏伟工程。一批新兴的工业基地也相继在内陆地区崛起。据统计，内地创造的工业总产值现在已占全国工业总产值的40％左右。
    “闭塞区”内通道纵横。过去西北、西南的交通很不方便，严重阻碍了经济的发展。新中国成立后，立即展开了大规模的铁路、公路建设。经过40年的努力，建成了连接西北、西南、中南地区的宝成、湘黔、襄渝三条铁路。随着川黔、成渝、贵昆、成昆铁路的建成，西南各省间又有了联贯的动脉。为了贯通西北地区的交通，又先后新建了包兰、天兰、兰新、兰青铁路，在新疆建设了南疆铁路。在腹地兴建的焦枝、枝柳铁路，又使我国增添了一条纵贯南北的重要通道。现在，京广线以西的铁路里程已由解放初占全国铁路里程的19.5％提高到45％。公路建设也有了很大发展。目前，除西藏的墨脱县外已县县通了公路。川藏、青藏公路的修建，大大改善了西藏的交通。民航事业的发展更为瞩目，成都、昆明、乌鲁木齐已建起了设备比较齐全的民航机场。
    “一头沉”渐趋“两头平”。解放初期，人们称我国沿海与内地的工业布局为“一头沉”。工业主要集中于上海、天津、青岛、广州和辽宁等几个省市。广阔的内地和边疆地区的工业很少，尤其是占全国面积近70％的西北、西南和内蒙古地区，工业仅占全国的10％左右。为改变这一不合理状况，新中国在建设投资分配上实行了“两头平”的政策。40年来，国家用于内地的基本建设投资达7200多亿元，占全国投资总额的49％。
    专家认为，我国工业经济布局的改善，缩小了内地和沿海经济发展的差距，优化了生产力的配置，对推动国民经济平稳协调发展具有重要意义。
