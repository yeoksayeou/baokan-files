Thailand's poultry and livestock products, such as chickens, ducks, meat, and eggs, not only meet domestic market demands but also have increasing export volumes. Frozen chickens, pork, and eggs have become one of the top ten export items in the world.

The driving force behind the rapid development of Thailand's livestock industry is modernization and scientific management. Currently, apart from large-scale farms like the Charoen Pokphand Company, which use advanced global equipment, superior breeds, and feeding methods, ordinary farms and family-run livestock businesses also have modern and scientific management levels. Recently, the reporter visited the Thalenji Farm in Pathum Thani Province, which serves as a typical example. Thalenji Farm is a family-run operation managed by six brothers, the Chen family. Each brother is responsible for a different aspect. Mr. Chen Junyi, around 40 years old, speaks fluent English and drove us around in a small truck to tour each section of the farm. Whether it was the chicken farm or the pig farm, the facilities were simple and unadorned. However, the farm produces 80,000 pigs, 6 million broilers, and 2.5 million ducks annually, in addition to a large quantity of eggs. Besides supplying the local market, they also export their products. According to Mr. Chen, the farm has been continuously introducing foreign superior breeds for the past 20 years. Currently, the farm has pigs from 10 countries in Europe, America, and Oceania, as well as American broiler chickens and Beijing ducks. After introduction, the breeds undergo trial rearing, followed by crossbreeding to combine their advantages and develop new breeds that are suitable for local conditions, grow quickly, have good meat quality, and strong disease resistance.

Mr. Chen emphasized that having superior breeds alone is not enough in the rearing process. Feed processing and formulation are equally important. For this reason, the farm has purchased advanced machinery and equipment, achieving modernized and automated feed processing, formulation, and supply. Upon arriving at the feed processing plant, we saw various signals flashing on the instruments in the computer control room, and the machines were running non-stop. The owner told us that this plant processes and formulates 30 tons of feed per hour. Due to computer control, the entire process only requires one person to operate.

In the overall management of the farm, this farm pays attention to the technical skills of the workers and their ability to handle multiple tasks. Among the 300 employees, there are 3 veterinarians and 20 technical backbones. The rest are feeders. Mr. Chen said that in reality, these feeders are also technical personnel. Because they must know how to manage and feed using scientific methods and also understand some basic veterinary knowledge. To improve the technical skills of the feeders, we send them to veterinary universities for courses. We also actively learn advanced technologies and management methods from outside to improve ourselves.

Thalenji Farm is just one of many ordinary farms in Thailand, but it can be said to be a microcosm of Thailand's livestock industry.

　　泰国饲养业的缩影
　　——访泰仑吉家庭饲养场
　　本报记者　刘爱成
    泰国的鸡鸭、肉蛋等畜禽产品，不仅在国内市场上供过于求，而且出口量越来越大。冻鸡、猪肉及鸡蛋的出口已跻身于世界十大出口国之一。
    泰国饲养业快速发展的动力是现代化和科学化。目前除了像正大公司这样以世界先进设备、良种和饲养方法进行大规模饲养外，其他普通饲养场及家庭饲养业也都具有现代化和科学化水平。记者最近访问了佛统府泰仑吉饲养场便是一例。泰仑吉饲养场是一个普通家庭式的饲养场。该场由陈俊义兄弟6人合办经营。每个兄弟负责一个方面。陈俊义先生40岁左右，能讲一口流利的英语，开着一辆小货车，带我们参观了每一个分场。无论是鸡场还是猪场，房屋设施简朴无华。但每年却产猪8万头，肉鸡600万只，肉鸭250万只，此外还有大量的鸡蛋。除了供应当地市场外，还出口。据他介绍，该饲养场从20年前就开始不断引进外国良种。目前场里有引自欧、美、大洋洲10个国家的种猪，美国种鸡和北京鸭。引进后，首先进行试养，然后杂交，集各种优点，培育能适应于当地饲养，生长快，肉质好，抗病力强的新品种。
    陈先生强调，在饲养过程中，光有良种还不行。饲料加工、配比同样重要。为此，场里购置了先进的机械设备。实现了饲料加工、配比、供给现代化和自动化。来到饲料加工厂，只见电脑控制室的仪器上闪烁着不同的信号灯，各种机器不停地运转着。主人告诉我们，这个加工厂每小时加工、配比饲料30吨。由于电脑控制，整个过程只需一人操作。
    这个饲养场在整个饲养场的饲养管理中注重工作人员的技术素质和一专多能。在300名雇工中，有3名兽医，20名技术骨干。其余为饲养员。陈先生说，实际上这些饲养员也是技术人员。因为他们必须懂得如何用科学的方法去管理和饲养，同时还要懂得一些兽医常识。为了提高饲养人员的技术，我们送他们去兽医大学听课。我们也都自觉地注意吸取外界的先进技术和管理方法，提高充实自己。
    泰仑吉饲养场只是泰国许多普通饲养场中的一个，但它可以说是泰国饲养业的缩影。
