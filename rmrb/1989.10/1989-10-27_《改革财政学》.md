    *On Fiscal Reform*
    By Wang Shaofei  Published by China Financial and Economic Publishing House
    The distinctive feature of this book is its recognition of a planned commodity economy based on public ownership. It proposes the reconstruction of a fiscal system that adapts to the development of a socialist commodity economy, among other important reform ideas. The author emphasizes that reform is not about negating the public ownership of the means of production, but rather about focusing efforts on studying the operational mechanisms to make enterprises autonomous in management and responsible for their own profits and losses, thereby becoming socialist commodity producers and operators.

    本书的特点在于确认公有制基础上的有计划商品经济，提出重建适应社会主义商品经济发展的财政体制等许多重要改革思想。作者强调，改革不是要否定生产资料公有制，而是要花力气研究经营机制，使企业成为自主经营、自负盈亏的社会主义商品生产者和经营者。
