The Fire Car Bodybuilding Association's sports work has been highly effective, with mass sports and competitive sports complementing each other, sailing far in the tide of mobilizing social forces to promote sports.

At the national railway commendation conference for sports excellence held on October 7, 179 advanced sports units and 218 advanced sports workers from the national railway system were commended and awarded.

The Fire Car Bodybuilding Association leverages its industrial advantages to develop some niche sports and achieve results. In November of last year, the Harbin Railway Bureau's rope skipping team represented China for the first time in the World Rope Skipping Championships, winning the B group championship. The Chinese rope skipping team, mainly composed of members of the Fire Car Bodybuilding Association, is actively preparing for the Asian Games next year. The Fire Car Bodybuilding Association's shuttlecock team has consecutively won the national championship for four years. Among the excellent teams of the Fire Car Bodybuilding Association, more than 60 people have been selected for the national team. The Fire Car Bodybuilding Association focuses on selecting and cultivating reserve talents from all railway workers, their families, and children, and has established 122 amateur sports schools nationwide.

In the recently concluded national football second-tier league finals, the Fire Car football team defeated strong teams such as Foshan, Sichuan, and Jilin, and was promoted to the first-tier league, becoming the first industry system football team to enter the first-tier league.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has awarded the Fire Car Bodybuilding Association of China for its outstanding contributions to sports.
