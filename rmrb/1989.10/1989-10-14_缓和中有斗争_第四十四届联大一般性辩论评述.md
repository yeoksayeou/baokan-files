The 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly's general debate concluded today. Over the course of three weeks, representatives from 154 countries took the floor to discuss a series of major issues facing the world today. Although the overall atmosphere was relatively calm, the differences and struggles were also evident.

Firstly, the specific proposals put forward by the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction and destruction of chemical weapons drew the attention of representatives from various countries. These proposals indicated some progress by the two superpowers in the issue of banning chemical weapons, but also exposed the ongoing contradictions and competition between them. U.S. President George H.W. Bush proposed a three-phase plan for the two countries to eliminate chemical weapons, but did not include the United States' advanced chemical weapons. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze proposed a further plan for the two countries to ban the production of all chemical weapons, aiming to prevent the United States from producing a new generation of "binary chemical weapons." The United States and the Soviet Union possess the world's largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, with each declaring to have over 30,000 tons and 50,000 tons respectively. Such a large quantity of chemical weapons undoubtedly poses a threat to human security. Therefore, while welcoming the proposals by the United States and the Soviet Union on chemical weapons, representatives from various countries also urged them to implement these proposals to facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive international convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons.

Secondly, the economic development of developing countries became a pressing issue of universal concern at the conference, with calls to establish a new international economic order more fervent than ever before. Many representatives from developing countries pointed out that the current international economic relations are unfair, such as the intensification of protectionism, making it difficult for the main products of developing countries to enter the international market; the debt burden of the Third World has increased, with a total amount exceeding $1.3 trillion; capital is flowing from poor countries to rich countries, with Latin American countries alone transferring $179 billion to developed countries in recent years, accounting for 4% of their GDP; the instability of the international monetary and financial markets, with high interest rates. They believe that these problems seriously hinder the economic recovery and development of developing countries, and it is urgent to launch a new round of substantive South-North dialogue to address them. They also hope that governments of all countries will pay sufficient attention to the special session of the General Assembly on economic issues scheduled for next April and prepare well.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen proposed for the first time at the UN General Assembly to establish a new international political order, which was welcomed by many developing countries. The core of this proposal is the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, opposing hegemony and power politics. During the debate, the United States was involved in an attempted coup in Panama. The temporary government of Panama, President Rodriguez, exposed a living example of the existence of hegemony and power politics. In addition, a few Western countries used "human rights" as an excuse to attack the Chinese government without reason in their speeches at the conference. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen exposed their interference in China's internal affairs, which completely violates the norms of international relations and the basic principles of the UN Charter. Foreign Minister Qian's speech was welcomed and congratulated by representatives from more than 50 countries. They supported China's just stance of equality among all countries, big or small, and opposition to power politics.

In this debate, Vietnam's deception of "complete withdrawal" was exposed. Vietnam chose to announce the "complete withdrawal" of the invading Vietnamese troops in Cambodia during the UN General Assembly debate, attempting to deceive international public opinion. However, the representatives attending the conference generally doubted this, believing that the withdrawal without effective international supervision was merely a propaganda tactic by Vietnam. The foreign ministers of Thailand and Singapore explicitly demanded that Vietnamese troops withdraw from Cambodia under UN supervision and seek a comprehensive and fair solution to the Cambodian issue.

This debate touched on various problems and contradictions that still exist in the world today. As an international organization, the United Nations has achieved certain results in its work, but it still faces a very arduous task in maintaining world peace and justice, opposing hegemony, and various forms of power politics.

    缓和中有斗争
    ——第四十四届联大一般性辩论评述
    本报记者　刘开宸
    第44届联合国大会一般性辩论今天结束。在历时3周的会议中，154国的代表相继发言，纵论当今世界一系列重大问题。虽然总的气氛较为缓和，但分歧和斗争也显而易见。
    首先，美苏对削减和销毁化学武器提出的具体建议，引起各国代表的注意。这些建议显示了两个超级大国在禁止化学武器问题上有所进展，也暴露了他们之间依然存在的矛盾和争夺。美国总统布什提出了两国分三阶段消除化学武器的建议，但并未包括美国的先进化学武器。苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽提出了两国禁止所有化学武器生产的进一步方案，目的在于阻止美国生产新一代“二元化学武器”。美苏拥有世界上最大的化学武库，各自宣布储存的化学武器分别为3万多吨和5万多吨，如此数量的化学武器无疑对人类的安全构成威胁。所以，各国代表在欢迎美苏就化学武器问题提出建议的同时，又敦促他们付诸实施，以利于缔结一项全面禁止化学武器的国际公约。
    其次，发展中国家经济发展成为大会普遍关注的紧迫问题，要求建立国际经济新秩序的呼声比以前任何一次会议都更为高涨。许多发展中国家代表指出，目前国际经济关系有欠公正，如保护主义加剧，发展中国家的主要产品难以进入国际市场；第三世界债务负担加重，总额超过1.3万亿美元；资金从穷国向富国倒流，仅拉美国家在最近几年里向发达国家转移的资金就达1790亿美元，占其年生产总值的4％；国际货币和金融市场不稳定，利率居高不下。他们认为，这些问题严重阻碍发展中国家经济的恢复和发展，迫切需要展开新一轮有实质意义的南北对话来加以解决。他们还希望各国政府对定于明年4月举行的讨论经济问题的特别联大予以充分重视，做好筹备工作。
    中国外长钱其琛首次在联大提出建立国际政治新秩序的主张，受到广大发展中国家的欢迎。该主张的核心是和平共处五项原则，反对霸权主义和强权政治。在大会辩论期间，适逢美国卷入巴拿马的未遂政变。巴拿马临时政府总统罗德里格斯所揭露的活生生的例子，表明霸权主义和强权政治的存在。此外，几个西方国家在大会的发言中，以“人权”为借口对中国政府进行毫无道理的攻击。钱其琛外长在发言中揭露他们干涉中国内政的作法完全违背国际关系准则和联合国宪章基本原则。钱外长的发言受到50多个国家代表的欢迎和祝贺。他们支持中国主张的大小国家一律平等、反对强权政治的正义立场。
    在这次辩论中，越南玩弄“全部撤军”的骗局被揭穿。越南选择在联大辩论期间宣称侵柬越军“全部撤回”，是企图欺骗国际舆论，但与会代表对此普遍怀疑，认为在没有有效的国际监督的情况下进行的这种撤军只不过是越南耍弄的一种宣传手法。泰国和新加坡等国外长明确地要求越南军队在联合国监督下真正撤离柬埔寨，并寻求柬埔寨问题全面、公正的解决。
    这次辩论触及当今世界仍然存在的种种问题与矛盾，联合国作为一个国际机构，工作虽取得一定成就，但在维护世界和平和正义、反对霸权主义和形形色色的强权政治方面，仍面临着十分艰巨的任务。
