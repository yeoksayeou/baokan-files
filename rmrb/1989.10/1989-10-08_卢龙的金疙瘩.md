Lulong County is located at the southern foot of the Yanshan Mountains in Hebei Province. The area suffers from a lack of groundwater and has few significant resources, and long-term flooding and droughts have made life difficult for the locals. Now, sweet potatoes have become the "golden nugget" that has helped the region rise from poverty, and farmers have found a path to prosperity through processing sweet potatoes. Recently, we saw that the high and low hills were covered with lush sweet potato vines, a sign of another bumper harvest.

County Party Secretary Zhang Shuren eagerly introduced the situation to us: "Sweet potatoes are not afraid of drought or flooding, are not damaged by hail, and have few pests. The locals call it the 'iron-stem crop,' and it is a treasure of our county. Farmers have the habit of cultivating it and are very skilled at processing sweet potatoes. Over the past decade of rural reforms, Lulong has formed a sweet potato processing group with farmers as the main body. Farmers drill wells themselves, buy water pumps, power machines, crushers, and so on. There are nearly 100,000 such processing points across the county. Production promotes processing, and processing in turn drives production. The county's sweet potato planting area has expanded from about 180,000 mu to over 310,000 mu."

Lulong farmers process fresh sweet potatoes into starch and noodles, which are not easily infested by insects or spoiled. Most of these products are sold to Northeast China, and some are exported to South Korea, Libya, and the United States. In June of this year, Lulong also signed a contract to establish a Sino-American joint venture, and a production line for 1,000 tons of vermicelli per year is under construction. Farmers have calculated the following sweet potato accounts: sweet potatoes yield an average of 1,700 kg per mu, and the first processing can produce 300 kg of starch, worth 500 yuan; the second processing can produce 300 kg of noodles and vermicelli, increasing the value to 640 yuan. In contrast, growing corn in Lulong yields an average of 400 kg per mu, with income of less than 300 yuan. The net income from one mu of sweet potatoes is equivalent to that from two mu of corn.

During our visit to Lulong, we also learned that sweet potato chips can be processed into lactic acid chemical raw materials, which can be used as additives in food processing, pharmaceuticals, and leather manufacturing, with considerable economic benefits. Lulong's annual production capacity is 1,000 tons, with 700 tons exported, and export income alone can reach 3.5 million yuan. They also process citric acid calcium from sweet potato residue, with an annual production of 300 tons, all of which are exported, bringing in another 1 million yuan. Farmers use fresh sweet potato vines to make pickles, which are also export goods, adding another income stream for farmers. Farmers also use sweet potato residue to make liquor and feed. Before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the county's per capita income was only 90 yuan, but last year it increased to 598 yuan. Of this, the added value from sweet potato processing alone accounted for 360 yuan per person, and many households have become wealthy through sweet potatoes.

As we were about to leave, Comrade Zhang Shuren made a sincere request to us: he learned that domestic researchers have discovered the medicinal value of sweet potatoes, and he warmly welcomes colleagues who are dedicated to this research to come to Lulong, allowing sweet potatoes to achieve new feats.

    卢龙的金疙瘩
    冯泰　尹韵秋
    卢龙县坐落在河北省燕山南麓，地下缺水，也没有什么重要资源，加之长期涝旱，群众生活比较困难。如今，白薯成了当地翻身脱贫的“金疙瘩”，农民通过加工白薯走上了致富路。前不久，我们在这里看到，高高低低的岗坡，被绿油油的地瓜藤叶覆盖着，这铺满大地的薯苗子预示着又一个丰收年。
    县委书记张树仁见到我们，便滔滔不绝地介绍起来：白薯不怕旱涝，不怕雹打，少生虫害，群众称它为“铁秆庄稼”，是本县的一宝。农民有种植习惯，搞白薯加工也很内行。农村改革十年来，卢龙已形成了一个以农户为主体的白薯加工群体。农户自己打井，买抽水机、动力机、粉碎机等等；这种加工点全县办了将近十万个。生产促进加工，加工反过来又推动生产。全县白薯种植面积由十八万亩左右扩大到三十一万多亩。
    卢龙农民用鲜薯加工的淀粉和粉条，不易生虫、不易变质，大部分销往东北，还出口南朝鲜、利比亚和美国。今年六月，卢龙还签约办起了中美合资企业，一条年产一千吨的粉丝生产流水线正在建设之中。农民算了这样一笔白薯帐：白薯平均亩产一千七百多公斤，第一次加工能出淀粉三百多公斤，值五百元钱；第二次加工能出粉条、粉丝三百多公斤，可增值到六百四十元。而在卢龙种玉米，平均亩产四百公斤，收入不到三百元钱。一亩白薯的纯收入相当于两亩玉米。
    在卢龙采访时，我们还了解到，拿薯干加工乳酸类化工原料，可用作食品加工、医药和皮革制造业的添加剂，经济效益相当可观。卢龙年生产能力一千吨，出口七百吨，仅出口收入即可达到三百五十万元。他们还用薯粉渣加工柠檬酸钙生物化工原料，年产三百吨，全部出口，又可收入一百万元。农民拿鲜薯藤梗做咸菜，也是出口货，又可给农民增加一笔收入。农民还用薯渣做烧酒和饲料。党的十一届三中全会前，全县人均收入仅九十元，去年增加到五百九十八元，其中仅白薯加工增值一项，人均就收入三百六十元，不少农户靠白薯发家。
    临别时，张树仁同志向我们提出一个恳切的要求：他得知国内已有科研人员研究出白薯的药用价值，他热诚欢迎潜心搞这项研究的同志到卢龙来，让白薯再立新功。
