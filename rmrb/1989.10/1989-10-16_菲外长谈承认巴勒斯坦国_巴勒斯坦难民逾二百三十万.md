Xinhua News Agency, Manila, October 14th.

The Philippine Foreign Minister Raul Manglapus said today in Manila that recognizing the State of Palestine is a logical move by the Philippines to seek national interests.

In a statement issued today, he pointed out that the Philippines has consistently supported the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence in international affairs. Recognizing the State of Palestine is a "necessary result" of the series of actions taken by the Philippines at the United Nations General Assembly.

He said, "This shows that we have the ability to boldly seek our national interests and execute a more independent and decisive foreign policy."

    他在今天发表的一项声明中指出，菲律宾在国际事务中一贯支持巴勒斯坦人民自决和独立的权力，承认巴勒斯坦国是菲律宾在联合国大会上所采取的一系列行动的“必然结果”。
    他说：“这表明我们有能力大胆寻求我们国家利益和执行更加独立和果断的外交政策。”
