Among the young Chinese painters I have met, Wu Dongkui's paintings have left a particularly deep and strong impression on me.

Firstly, I must affirm Wu Dongkui's solid traditional foundation. Chinese painting relies on the precision of ink and brushwork, the subtle use of colors, and the ingenious composition, all of which require long-term practice and refinement. Without a relentless spirit of diligence and a unique artistic flair, it is impossible. Wu Dongkui precisely possesses these two qualities. I have heard that his life has been quite hard, growing up in a rural area of Shandong without a particularly good artistic environment. Given the achievements he has attained today, I can fully understand the tenacious and resilient efforts he must have made to eventually enter the realm of art.

However, does establishing a solid traditional foundation mean one can become an artist of exceptional skill? Not necessarily. When one reaches a certain level in painting, the artist's temperament, cultivation, personality, and spirit of exploration become more substantial conditions. This is a comprehensive effect, a spiritual and idealized element that lies both outside and within the work. Without this, it is impossible to create an art style of one's own, and it is difficult to become a true artist. Young painter Wu Dongkui is precisely noteworthy in this regard. He is not constrained, emphasizing the use of various techniques, and infusing ordinary objects with a unique sense of beauty. Through the depiction of flowers, birds, animals, and other objects, he provides us with a more vivid, more ideal, and more spatially aware sense of life. For example, his paintings of lotus, magnolia, gourds, and water lilies use his own unique methods. The ink is rich and flowing, moist but not excessive, dry yet moist, wild yet refined, blending thick and thin, dry and wet into a harmonious whole. This makes the variations in ink and color in the work appear wonderfully, giving a completely new artistic sensation. Many of his techniques in the works are unique and his own. Therefore, this is very precious and worthy of praise.

    走笔见精神
    ——观吴东魁画絮语
    刘开渠
    在我所认识的青年国画家中，吴东魁的画给我留下了极为深刻、强烈的印象。
    我首先要肯定吴东魁那扎实的传统功底。中国画靠水墨、线条的准确，色彩的艳淡，构图的精妙，都要靠长期练习、研磨，没有一种孜孜不倦的刻苦精神，没有一种独运匠心的艺术灵气，是不行的。而吴东魁恰恰具备了这两个方面。我听说，他的身世是很苦的，生在并无很好艺术环境的山东农村，拿他今天所取得的成绩看，我便完全能够清楚他为最终步入艺术殿堂，做出了多少坚韧、顽强的努力。
    然而，扎实传统功底的建立，是否就意味着能够成为艺高一筹的艺术家了呢？并不如此。画画到一定时候，画家本人的气质、修养、个性以及探索精神便成为更为实质性的条件，它是一种综合性的效应，是一种潜藏在作品之外又蕴含于作品之中的精神化、理想化的东西，不具备这一点，就不可能研创出属于自己的艺术个性，也就难于成为真正的艺术家。青年画家吴东魁也正是在这一点上值得肯定。他不受束缚，注重调动诸多手段，在平凡的物象中注入个人独特的美感形式，通过所描绘的花鸟、动物等物象，提供给我们一种更生动、更理想、更具空间感的生命意志。例如他画的芙蓉、玉兰、葫芦、荷花，采用了自己研探出的独特方法，水墨淋漓、湿而不滥、枯中带润、苍莽华滋，浓淡枯湿浑然一体，使水墨的变化在作品中显见出奇妙的光与色，给人一种全新的艺术感受。他在作品中的许多技法处理是独特的、属于自己的。因之，这便显得很可贵，很值得称道。
