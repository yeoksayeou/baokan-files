	History Reenacted
	—Introducing China's First Panorama
	Wáng Hànwén

	Time: October 14, 1948.
	Place: North of Jinzhou City.
	Scene: The total assault begins. The enemy's defensive fortifications are breached, and our Northeast Field Army, braving the barrage of bullets, surges forward like a tidal wave, crossing the moat with ladders and human chains, engaging in hand-to-hand combat at the breach. Subsequently, our tanks advance, blowing up bunkers and engaging in street fighting... The distant mountains are shrouded in smoke, flames soar into the sky, the nearby scene is a wasteland, with destroyed military vehicles, discarded weapons and supplies, collapsed trenches, and blown-up barbed wire, all in disarray. The sounds of exploding shells, burning fires, moving tanks, machine gun fire, and hand-to-hand combat fill the air... This is the scene presented in our country's first panorama, "The Capture of Jinzhou." Standing in front of the painting, you will feel as if you are in the midst of a fierce urban battle.

	This panorama was painted at the site of the Jinzhou battle. The painting is continuous and circular, suspended in a panorama hall with a space of 34,000 cubic meters. The canvas is 122.24 meters long and 16.1 meters high, with a total painting area of 1968 square meters. After completion, the painting weighs about 4 tons. Additionally, there is a 1000 square meter ground sculpture. Its scale is unprecedented in our country.

	The capture of Jinzhou was a crucial battle in the Liaoshen Campaign. To reenact this glorious page in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Liaoshen Campaign Memorial Hall Construction Committee established the panorama creation team in 1986. The artists followed the realistic method of creation, studying war history and a large number of historical photographs and documentary films, interviewing veterans who participated in the battle, and experiencing life in the participating units. They conducted field surveys and aerial reconnaissance, collecting creative materials. After extensive preparatory work, they designed multiple sketches and then used highly realistic oil painting techniques to begin full-scale painting in early 1989. The creators also visited the panoramas in Moscow and Volgograd in the Soviet Union and discussed a series of key technical issues in the design and painting of panoramas with the panorama artists of the Grekov Military Art Academy. At each major moment of modifying and finalizing the creation plan, they received specific guidance from the old generals who commanded this battle. Through the joint efforts of nearly 20 painters, stage art workers, and dozens of assistants over three years, this masterpiece was completed.

	The ground sculpture team for the panorama, in order to truly reenact history, went to the Revolutionary Military Museum to study the shapes and structures of weapons used by both sides during the War of Liberation, creating extremely realistic models at various scales. Under the dome-shaped canopy with a diameter of over 20 meters at the top of the hall, hundreds of milk-white daylight lamps and golden high-pressure sodium lamps are arranged in a circle to form the color tone of the sunlight at around 2 PM in the late autumn in Jinzhou. Under the carefully set lighting, the sky and ground in the painting are extremely uniform and bright, making it difficult to distinguish between the painted scenery and the real scenery. The design plan for the hall was based on 22 schemes from ten design units, and was designed under the leadership of Dai Nianci, president of the Chinese Architectural Society. The exterior of the hall resembles a large white cylindrical building, standing on the north side of the Liaoshen Campaign Memorial Hall. It is a reinforced concrete closed fortress-style building, with a span of 42.24 meters and a height of 28 meters. Ascending the spiral staircase, one arrives at the circular viewing platform in the center of the hall, with a diameter of 14 meters. Walking around in a clockwise direction, one can fully appreciate the entire panorama. The panorama hall, from its main structure, surface decoration to internal settings, has reached the top level in the country. The birth of this panorama indicates that our country's ability to use this comprehensive art and science and technology has reached a certain level, filling a gap in our country's museum and art industries.

    历史在这里再现
    ——介绍我国第一幅全景画
    王汉文
    时间：1948年10月14日。
    地点：锦州城北。
    图景：总攻开始。敌城防工事被突破，我东北野战军冒着弹雨，呈排山倒海之势冲过护城河，以木梯、人梯登上突破口，与敌展开肉搏拚杀。随后，我坦克进击、炸碉堡、巷战……远山硝烟弥漫，火光冲天，近景一片废墟，击毁的军车、丢弃的武器、物资，倒塌的战壕，炸断的铁丝网，一片狼藉，耳边传来炮弹爆炸、大火燃烧、战车行驶、机枪扫射、肉搏拚杀的混合音响……这就是展现在我们眼前的我国第一幅全景画——《攻克锦州》。站在画前，您会感到自己置身于一场艰苦卓绝的城市攻坚战之中。
    这幅全景画绘于锦州攻坚战所在地。画面首尾相接呈环形，悬挂在占有3.4万立方米空间的全景画馆内。画布长122.24米，高16.1米，绘画总面积1968平方米，绘画完成后总重量达4吨左右。另有1000平方米地面塑形。其规模之大在我国前所未有。
    攻克锦州是辽沈战役的关键一仗。为了再现中国人民解放战争史上这光辉的一页，辽沈战役纪念馆建馆委员会于1986年组建了全景画创作组。画家们遵循现实主义的创作方法，研究了战史和大量的历史照片、资料影片，采访当年参战指战员并在参战部队体验生活，进行地形踏勘和航空勘测，搜集创作素材。经过大量准备工作，进行了多次草图设计，然后采用高度写实的油画技巧，于1989年初投入全面绘制工作。创作人员还去苏联考察了莫斯科和伏尔加格勒的全景画，并同格列柯夫军事画院的全景画家们探讨了全景画设计、绘制中的一系列关键技术问题。在创作方案修改和定稿的每个主要时刻，都得到了当年指挥这场战斗的老将军们的具体指导。经过近20名画家、舞台美术工作者和几十名辅助人员历时3年的通力合作，完成了这一巨作。
    全景画地面塑形人员为了真实地再现历史，到革命军事博物馆研究了解放战争时期敌我两军武器的造型、结构，按照各种比例缩小制成极为逼真的模型。在馆顶下直径20多米的伞形吊棚内，环布几百只乳白色日光灯和金黄色高显钠灯，以形成锦州地区深秋季节下午两点钟左右的日光照射下的色调。在精心设置的灯光下，画中的天空和地面极为均匀明亮，使人无法看出画面景物和真实景物的区别。画馆设计方案是在十个设计单位作出的22个方案基础上，由全国建筑学会理事长戴念慈主持设计的。画馆外观像一个乳白色大圆柱，矗立在辽沈战役纪念馆北侧，为钢筋混凝土密闭堡垒式建筑，跨度42.24米，高28米。沿楼梯盘旋而上，便来到位于画馆中央、直径14米的圆形看台。沿顺时针方向行走一周，即可饱览整个全景画。全景画馆从主体结构、表面装修到内部设置均达国内一流水平。这幅全景画的诞生说明我国运用这种综合性艺术和科学技术的能力已经达到一定水平，填补了我国博物馆事业和美术事业的一项空白。（附图片）
