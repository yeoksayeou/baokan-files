	The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Zhu Jianhong reports: Since the implementation of China's first law on mineral resource management, the "Mineral Resources Law," three years ago, efforts by various levels of government and relevant departments have brought China's work in mineral resource exploration, development, and protection into a new phase of legal regulation. However, due to long-standing issues, China currently faces significant resource loss and waste. The order of mining, mineral circulation, and import and export needs further rectification.

	Since the implementation of the "Mineral Resources Law," several supporting regulations and management measures have been issued. Ninety percent of cities and counties with significant mining activities have established mineral management agencies. Mineral resource exploration registration has become standardized, with 7,188 exploration permits issued over the past three years, resolving approximately 600 exploration rights disputes and saving nearly 100 million yuan in geological exploration investment. Mining registration has been fully launched, and by July of this year, 66.3% of state-owned mines have obtained mining permits through supplementary registration. In the rectification of township mining, 55.6% of township mines have obtained mining registration certificates.

	However, due to a period of emphasis on slogans such as "quick flow of water," large mines being fully developed, and small mines being opened up, management of township mining has been relaxed. The relationship between the state, collective, and individual in mining development has not been properly handled, leading to considerable disorder in the mining industry. Mining rights disputes are widespread, with approximately 70% of state-allocated mines having farmers entering for mining, and about 100 hotspot mining areas with intense disputes. By March of this year, 41 of these hotspots have been resolved through coordination, but 89 new hotspots have emerged, seriously disrupting the normal production order of state-owned mining enterprises. Additionally, township mining faces issues such as frequent safety accidents and predatory mining, causing significant economic losses to the state. From 1982 to 1987, individual gold mining in the northwest region is estimated to have mined 200,000 taels of gold, with resource damage and loss reaching 24.6 million taels, over 100 times the production, resulting in an estimated direct economic loss of 24 billion yuan. Furthermore, the circulation and export order of mineral products is chaotic, with various "speculators" buying and selling at inflated prices and severe smuggling, particularly in gold smuggling.

	To rectify this chaotic situation, it is necessary to deeply implement the "Mineral Resources Law" and strengthen macro-management of the mining industry. To this end, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, and the Ministry of Supervision have decided to conduct a nationwide inspection of the enforcement of mineral resource regulations from September of this year to February of next year.

### 《矿产资源法》实施三年成绩可观  资源损失浪费仍很严重矿业秩序需进一步整顿

    《矿产资源法》实施三年成绩可观
    资源损失浪费仍很严重矿业秩序需进一步整顿
    本报讯　记者朱剑红报道：自三年前我国第一部矿产资源管理的法规——《矿产资源法》实施以来，在各级政府及有关部门的努力下，我国矿产资源的勘查、开发和保护工作已步入有法可依的新阶段。但是，由于多年来积累的问题，我国目前资源损失浪费还相当严重，采矿、矿产的流通和进出口秩序有待进一步整顿。
    《矿产资源法》实施以来，一些配套法规及管理办法陆续出台，全国矿业开发活动较多的地（市）、县有90％已建立了矿管机构。矿产资源的勘查登记工作已步入正轨，三年来共发放7188个项目的勘查许可证，调处约600起探矿权属纠纷，节约近亿元的地勘费投入。采矿登记工作全面展开，到今年7月，已有66.3％的全民所有制矿山通过补办登记获得了采矿许可证。在乡镇矿业的清理整顿中，55.6％的乡镇矿已办了采矿登记证。
    但是，由于一段时间内片面强调“有水快流”、大矿大开、小矿放开等口号，放松了对乡镇矿业的管理，没有正确处理国家、集体、个人三者在矿业开发中的关系，以致矿业秩序相当混乱。采矿权属纠纷量大面广，据1987年统计，全国约70％的统配矿山范围有农民进入采矿，纠纷尖锐的热点矿区约100个。到今年3月，经协调后解决了41个，但又出现了89个新的热点。严重干扰了国营矿山企业正常的生产秩序。同时，乡镇矿业普遍存在着安全事故多、掠夺性开采等问题，给国家带来巨大经济损失。1982年至1987年，西北地区的个体土法采金，据估算共采金20万两，资源破坏损失高达2460万两，为产量的100多倍，直接经济损失约240亿元。此外，矿产品流通和出口秩序混乱，各类“倒爷”抬价收购、倒买倒卖，走私严重。其中黄金走私最为突出。
    为了扭转这种混乱局面，必须深入贯彻实施《矿产资源法》，加强矿业的宏观管理。为此，地矿部、国务院法制局和监察部决定，从今年9月到明年2月，在全国范围内开展矿产资源法规执行情况的大检查。
