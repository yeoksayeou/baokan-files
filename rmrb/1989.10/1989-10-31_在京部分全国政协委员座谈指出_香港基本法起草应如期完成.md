The People's Daily, Beijing, October 30th - Reporters Zhai Xiangqian and Zhong Jia report: Today is the day before the end of the consultation period for the draft of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Law Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Committee for the Promotion of National Reunification invited the Deputy Secretary-General of the Drafting Committee and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Lu Ping, to introduce the latest developments regarding the drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong and to hold a discussion on the draft. Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Qian Weichang, presided over the meeting.

Lu Ping briefed the attending members on the situation in Hong Kong and the consultation on the draft of the Basic Law since May and June.

The members present at the discussion expressed their views, stating that the drafting of the Basic Law has been underway for four years, during which extensive consultations were conducted, fully soliciting opinions from Hong Kong and other regions of the country. After repeated democratic consultations and discussions, the current draft reflects the principle of "one country, two systems" and the spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, maintaining the unity of the motherland while considering the reality of Hong Kong. The vast majority of the articles in the draft have been approved by more than two-thirds of the members, and it is generally satisfactory and does not require major revisions. The final adoption and promulgation of the Basic Law should also proceed on schedule and should not be delayed.

The members discussed the relationship between the Constitution and the Basic Law, believing that the Constitution is the parent law, and the Basic Law is the subsidiary law. It is not possible to use the subsidiary law to restrict the parent law. However, the current draft of the Basic Law's preamble and relevant articles have already ensured its constitutionality, so there is no conflict between the Basic Law and the Constitution.

The members expressed that after 1997, the stationing of troops in Hong Kong is a symbol of China's resumption of sovereignty. How to station troops and how many troops to station are internal affairs of China, and foreign countries have no right to interfere. This issue has been clearly stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and we cannot retreat from this position.

The attending members pointed out that Hong Kong has had no democracy for over a hundred years, with administrative, legislative, and military powers all concentrated in the hands of the governor. After 1997, Hong Kong should implement a democratic system, but it must start from reality and proceed gradually, allowing all strata to participate. Otherwise, it will not be conducive to the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. The development of the political system must be based on the principle of "one country, two systems" and must not lead to the formation of a power that can be used by a minority to oppose the central government.

The members also pointed out in their speeches that some people are playing the "confidence card," "public opinion card," and "internationalization card" to pressure China, attempting to interfere with the drafting of the Basic Law, but this will not succeed. Many members suggested that the Basic Law should include a provision that Hong Kong should not be used as a base to subvert the central government, and at the same time, a provision should be added that foreign countries should not interfere in China's internal affairs, including Hong Kong.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Cheng Siyuan, attended today's meeting. Also present were some mainland members of the Basic Law Drafting Committee of Hong Kong.

### 在京部分全国政协委员座谈指出  香港基本法起草应如期完成

　　在京部分全国政协委员座谈指出
　　香港基本法起草应如期完成
    本报北京10月30日讯　记者翟象乾、钟嘉报道：今天是香港特别行政区基本法（草案）征求意见期结束的前一天，全国政协法制委员会、祖国统一联谊委员会邀请起草委员会副秘书长、国务院港澳办公室副主任鲁平介绍有关香港基本法起草的新情况，并就基本法（草案）进行了座谈。全国政协副主席钱伟长主持了会议。
    鲁平向与会委员介绍了五六月份后香港的形势和基本法（草案）征求意见的情况。
    与会委员们在座谈中发言表示，基本法的起草工作已经进行了四年，其间进行了大量咨询工作，充分征求了香港和全国其它地区的意见，经过反复的民主协商讨论，现在的草案能充分体现“一国两制”的方针和中英联合声明的精神，既维护了祖国的统一，又照顾到香港的现实。草案的绝大部分条文都获得全体委员2／3以上多数通过，它基本上是令人满意的，不需再作很大修改。基本法的最后通过和颁布时间也应按期进行，不要再推后。
    委员们谈到关于宪法与基本法的关系问题时认为，宪法是母法，基本法是子法，不能以子法来限制母法，但目前基本法（草案）中的序言和有关条文规定已保障了基本法的合宪性，因此不存在基本法与宪法相冲突的问题。
    委员们表示，1997年后在香港驻军是中国恢复行使主权的一个象征，怎样驻军，驻多少军队，均是中国的内部事务，外国无权干涉。这个问题，中英联合声明已有明确规定，我们不能从这个立场上后退。
    与会委员指出，香港100多年都没有民主可言，行政、立法、军事三大权集于总督一身。1997年后，香港要实行民主政制，但必须从实际出发，循序渐进，并使各阶层都能参与，否则，不利于香港的稳定繁荣。政制的发展，必经建立在“一国两制”的基础上，决不允许导致形成一个可以为少数人利用来同中央对抗的政权。
    委员们发言中还指出，现在有人打出“信心牌”、“民意牌”和“国际化牌”，对中国施加压力，企图干扰基本法的起草工作，但这是绝不会得逞的。不少委员建议，应在基本法中加进不允许把香港变成颠覆中央人民政府的基地的条款，同时加进不允许外国干涉包括香港在内的我国内政的条款。
    全国政协副主席程思远出席了今天的会议，出席会议的还有香港基本法起草委员会的部分内地委员。
