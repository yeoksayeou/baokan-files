Naps can improve work efficiency, according to a report by the West German newspaper *Welt am Sonntag*. The tendency to feel sleepy in the afternoon is determined by the body's biological clock. Taking a short nap in the middle of the day can enhance work efficiency. For a long time, sleep researchers around the world have focused solely on nighttime sleep. It was not until 1986 that a report on biological rhythms clearly established the biological significance of daytime sleep. German scientists conducted an experiment where volunteers spent three days and nights in a bunker, doing nothing—neither reading nor writing, and not even listening to music. Whenever they felt sleepy, they were allowed to sleep. The results showed that after nighttime sleep, there are several phases of sleepiness during the day, occurring approximately every four hours. Sleepiness is most pronounced around noon, while it is less intense at 9 AM and 5 PM. The peak of sleepiness occurs about twelve hours after the midpoint of nighttime sleep. For those who sleep from midnight to 6 AM, there is a biological need for sleep around 3 PM. Many studies have shown that napping has positive effects. After a nap, a person's attention, decision-making ability, and efficiency all improve, and their mood also becomes better. Research results also indicate that regularly taking a 30-minute nap can even reduce the risk of heart attacks.

　　午睡能提高工作效率
    据西德《星期日世界报》报道，人在下午发困是由人体生物钟决定的。午间小睡可提高工作效率。世界睡眠研究人员长期以来只从事夜间睡眠的研究，一九八六年关于生物节奏的研究报告才第一次明确了白天睡眠所具有的生物意义。西德的科学家曾作过试验，他们让志愿者在地堡里度过三天三夜，不做任何事情，既不阅读，也不写东西，甚至连音乐也不听，一旦想睡，就让他们睡。这一试验表明，夜里睡眠之后，白天又出现几个阶段的睡意，大约每四小时发困一次。困倦在中午最为明显，而在九点和十七点却不怎么厉害。最困的时间是在夜里睡眠一半时间后十二小时出现。从午夜睡到早晨六点的人，到十五点时就有一种睡眠的生物需要。许多调查表明，午睡具有积极作用，午睡后，人的注意力、决断力和效率都会提高，而且情绪也会更好。研究结果还表明，经常睡三十分钟午觉甚至可以减少心肌梗塞的危险。　　（新）
