Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 6th. People's Daily reporters Zhao Mingliang and Wang Yantian report: At today's third Qinghuangdao Coal Transportation Meeting, attendees showed a different demeanor from the past. The national target of 6 million tons of winter reserve electricity coal set by the State Council has been achieved ahead of schedule. The coal supply situation in major coal-consuming provinces and cities has also eased, ensuring a reliable coal supply for industrial and agricultural production and people's daily lives this winter and next spring.

This encouraging situation is the result of the concerted efforts of the broad cadres and workers in the railway, transportation, and coal industries, who have worked together to tap into potential and expand capacity. At today's meeting, Vice Premier Zhou Jiahuai, on behalf of the State Council, expressed heartfelt thanks to the cadres and workers in the coal transportation and related sectors.

Qinghuangdao is an important port for transporting coal from the north to the south. To ensure this year's electricity growth rate and prepare for production in early next year, as well as to arrange for the storage and transportation of coal for the winter, the State Planning Commission, in collaboration with the relevant departments of railways, transportation, and energy, held two on-site office meetings on coal transportation in Qinghuangdao at the end of July. They decided to organize the coal transportation in Qinghuangdao as a key task for developing the national economy and meeting the people's needs. In August and September, the coal transportation volume at Qinghuangdao Port reached an all-time high, with a total of 9.5 million tons of coal transported. Major ports such as Qingdao, Shiyu, and Lianyungang also considered the overall situation and completed their tasks on schedule despite the tight transportation capacity.

According to statistics, by the end of September, the national coal inventory for power generation had reached 6.83 million tons, an increase of 2.63 million tons compared to the same period last year; coking coal for metallurgy reached 0.71 million tons, approaching last year's level. By the end of August, the market coal inventory was 29.5 million tons, an increase of 6.3 million tons compared to the same period last year.

The improvement in coal transportation has promoted the growth of power generation. In August and September, the growth rate of national thermal power exceeded the 5.12% growth rate of the first seven months, with an increase of 9.9% in national thermal power generation in August compared to the same period last year.

In particular, the coal transportation in Qinghuangdao has effectively ensured the supply of electricity coal to economically developed regions such as East China and Guangdong. In August and September, the electricity coal inventory in East China increased by nearly 0.5 million tons, reaching 1.15 million tons by the end of September.

Zhou Jiahuai emphasized the need to continue to do a good job in energy and transportation this winter and next spring. He pointed out that the coal sector should, on the basis of ensuring the completion of the coal production plan, strive to increase production; the power sector should ensure the electricity supply for coal washing plants and key coal mines; the railway and transportation sectors should tap into potential and expand capacity, striving to transport more. In coal transportation, priority should be given to electricity coal, coal for railway locomotives, key steel plants, and civilian coal in the East China region.

    铁路交通煤炭系统通力合作
    煤炭供应趋缓
    邹家华要求继续抓好能源交通工作
    本报北京10月6日讯　新华社记者赵明亮、本报记者王彦田报道：在今天召开的第三次秦皇岛煤炭运输会议上，与会者一改过去焦虑的面容。国务院下达的全国冬储电煤600万吨的目标已提前实现，主要用煤省市煤炭供应紧张局面也得到缓解，今冬明春工农业生产和人民生活用煤有了可靠保证。
    这一令人欣慰的情况，是由于铁路交通、煤炭战线广大干部职工通力协作，挖潜扩能取得的。在今天的会议上，国务委员邹家华代表国务院向煤炭调运及有关战线的干部职工表示衷心感谢。
    秦皇岛是我国北煤南运的重要港口。为确保今年电力增长速度和为明年初的生产做好准备，安排好过冬煤炭的储运，国家计委会同铁道、交通、能源等有关部门7月底在秦皇岛召开了两次煤炭运输现场办公会，决定把组织好秦皇岛煤炭运输作为发展国民经济、保证人民生活需要。8、9两月秦皇岛港发运煤炭连创历史最高水平，共发运煤炭950万吨。青岛、石臼、连云港等主要港口也顾全大局，在运力十分紧张的情况下按计划完成了任务。
    据统计，到9月底全国发电用煤库存已达到683万吨，比去年同期增长263万吨；冶金炼焦煤达71万吨，接近去年水平。8月底市场用煤库存2950万吨，比去年同期增加630万吨。
    煤炭运输的改善促进了电力生产的增长，8、9两月全国火电增长速度均超过前七个月增长5.12％的速度，其中8月份全国火电发电量比去年同期增长9.9％。
    特别是，秦皇岛煤炭运输有力地保证了华东、广东等经济发达地区的电煤供应，8、9两个月华东电煤库存共增加近50万吨，到9月底华东电煤库存达到115万吨。
    邹家华要求进一步抓好今冬明春的能源交通工作。指出煤炭部门要在保证完成煤炭生产计划的基础上，努力组织多增产；电力部门对洗煤厂和重点煤矿的用电要切实保证；铁道、交通部门要挖潜扩能，力争多运。在煤炭运输中首先保电煤、铁路机车用煤、重点钢厂和华东地区的民用煤。
