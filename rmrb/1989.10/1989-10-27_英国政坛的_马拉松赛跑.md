Recently, the British political arena has seen a "marathon race," with the contestants being the ruling Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party. The goal is to secure a victory in the next general election, scheduled to be held in two years, and to reach Number 10 Downing Street.

The competition kicked off during the traditional season of political party conferences. In early October, the Labour Party held its conference in the seaside city of Brighton in southern England, issuing a challenge to the Conservatives. Shortly after, the Conservative Party convened from October 10 to 13 in the northern English tourist destination of Blackpool, ready to accept the Labour Party's challenge. Thus, with one in the south and one in the north, amidst an increasingly intense political drumbeat, this two-year-long contest between the two parties began.

It should be said that this race is taking place under conditions favorable to the Labour Party and unfavorable to the Conservatives. Firstly, the British economy has faced a series of difficulties this year. The bank lending interest rate is as high as 15%, the annual inflation rate is 7.6%, and the current account deficit in the balance of payments may reach 20 billion pounds this year. These three economic indicators are the highest among Western European countries. Secondly, the Conservative government's policies on the privatization of water and electricity, the implementation of the "poll tax," and the reform of the national health service have made many voters deeply dissatisfied and faced with obstacles everywhere. Recent opinion polls published in major British newspapers indicate that the Labour Party leads the Conservatives by 5 to 11 percentage points.

Meanwhile, after 10 consecutive years in power, Mrs. Thatcher's popularity has plummeted in opinion polls. An opinion poll published in the Observer showed that 58% of people hope that Mrs. Thatcher will step down in the next election, and 45% believe she should resign now.

In this situation, the Labour Party is jubilant, ready to seize the opportunity to press ahead and win the next election, avenging their defeats in the past three elections. The Conservatives, on the other hand, are demoralized and filled with doubts, hoping that Mrs. Thatcher will heed public opinion, adjust policies, and counter the Labour Party's challenge to ensure the Conservatives' victory in the next election.

Looking at this year's political party conference season in Britain, both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party have reviewed and adjusted their policies based on the current situation in Britain and the will of the voters. They have preliminarily determined their election strategies and are ready to decide the outcome in the next election. The Labour Party has adopted a series of moderate policies aimed at winning over voters, including abandoning unilateral nuclear disarmament, among others. The Conservatives, in order to alleviate the discontent among voters, emphasized that the party will pay more attention to "quality of life" issues in the future, such as the environment, transportation, education, and healthcare. Mrs. Thatcher also promised in her speech that the national health service will "never be privatized." Local observers believe that the Conservative government will enter a period of "adjustment and consolidation."

In Britain, whether a political party can win an election depends not only on whether its policies can win the support of voters but also on its image, including the image of its leader. At this Labour Party conference, the Labour Party's moderate policies and relatively unified display have strengthened Kinnock's leadership image to some extent. In contrast, the Conservative Party's main aim at this conference was to project an image of "collective leadership." The conference's prominent slogan was: "The right team for Britain's future." A Conservative Party member told reporters that the purpose of this was to change the impression among voters that Mrs. Thatcher is "a bit authoritarian" and that the Conservative Party has "no successors." Although the Labour Party has been leading in recent opinion polls, Labour Party leader Kinnock's popularity among voters is still not as high as Mrs. Thatcher's.

In summary, adjusting policies and changing images are the common characteristics of this year's Conservative Party and Labour Party conferences. After the Conservative Party conference, British newspapers published comments, with a relatively consistent view that "Thatcherism," which brought success to Britain in the 1980s, may become "outdated" if it does not adapt to the times and heed public sentiment.

The Financial Times said in an editorial on October 14, "As always, the key factor in determining the outcome of the next election will be the economy." It can be said for certain that the development of the British economy in the next two years will have a decisive influence on this marathon race between the two parties on the British political stage.

### 英国政坛的“马拉松赛跑”

　　英国政坛的“马拉松赛跑”
　　新华社记者　薛永兴
    最近，英国政坛展开了一场“马拉松赛跑”，参赛者仍然是执政的保守党和反对党工党，目标是在将于两年后举行的下届大选中，抢达唐宁街10号。
    比赛在英国传统的政党年会季节中拉开帷幕。10月初，工党在英格兰南部海滨城市布赖顿举行年会，向保守党提出挑战。紧接着，保守党10月10日至13日在英格兰北部旅游胜地布莱克普尔聚会，迎接工党挑战。这样，一南一北，在一阵紧似一阵的政治锣鼓声中，这场长达两年之久的两党角逐开场了。
    应该说，这次比赛是在有利于工党，不利于保守党的情况下举行的。首先，英国经济今年以来面临一系列困难，银行借贷利率高达15％、年通货膨胀率高达7.6％、国际收支经常项目逆差今年可能高达200亿英镑，这3项经济指数均居西欧国家之首。其次，保守党政府的水电私有化、推行“人头税”以及改革国民医疗保健制度等施政方针使很多选民深为不满，处处受阻。英国各主要报刊最近发表的民意测验结果表明，工党比保守党遥遥领先5到11个百分点。
    与此同时，已连续执政10年之久的撒切尔夫人的声望，在民意测验中直线下降。《观察家》刊登的一项民意测验表明，58％的人希望撒切尔夫人在下次大选时下台，45％的人认为她现在就应离位。
    在这一情况下，工党欢欣鼓舞，准备利用天赐良机，一鼓作气，乘胜追击，赢得下届大选，以报接连3次大选败北之仇；保守党则士气受挫，疑虑重重，期望撒切尔夫人重视民意，调整政策，回击工党挑战，以保证保守党在下次大选中立于不败之地。
    纵观今年英国的政党年会季节，保守党和工党在年会上均根据英国目前的实际以及选民的意向，对本党的政策进行了检讨和调整，初步确定了大选方针和策略，准备在下次大选中决一雌雄。工党通过了一系列旨在赢得选民的温和政策，包括放弃单方面核裁军，等等。保守党为了平息选民中的不满情绪，强调该党今后将更加重视“生活质量”问题，诸如环境、交通、教育和医疗保健等问题。撒切尔夫人还在讲话中保证，国民医疗保健制度将“永远不会私有化”。此间观察家认为，保守党政府将进入一个“调整巩固时期”。
    在英国，一个政党能否在大选中获胜，除了其政策是否能赢得选民的支持外，它的形象，包括它的领袖形象也是十分重要的因素。在这次工党年会上，工党通过的温和政策以及显示的相对团结，使金诺克的领袖形象得到了一定的加强。与此相反，保守党本届年会竭力塑造的则是“集体领导”形象，大会的醒目口号是：
  “英国未来的正确班子”。一位保守党人士对记者说，这样做的目的在于改变选民中觉得撒切尔夫人“有点专断”，以及保守党“后继无人”的印象。在最近的民意测验中，尽管工党一路领先，但工党领袖金诺克在选民中的声望仍不如撒切尔夫人。
    总之，调整政策，改变形象，是今年保守党和工党年会的共同特点。保守党年会结束后，英国各报纷纷发表评论，较为一致的看法是，“撒切尔主义”虽然在80年代使英国获得了成功，但如不适应时势，体察民情，就有可能“过时”。
      《金融时报》在10月14日的一篇社论中说，“像往常一样，决定下届大选胜负的关键因素将是经济。”可以肯定，今后两年英国经济的发展状况将对英国政坛这场两党“马拉松赛跑”产生决定性的影响。
