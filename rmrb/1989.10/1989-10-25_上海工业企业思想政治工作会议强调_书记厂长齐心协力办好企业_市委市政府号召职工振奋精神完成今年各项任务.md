Reporter Zhang Shihong reports: Today, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji said at the city-wide enterprise thought political work conference that it is crucial to strengthen the Party's leadership and enterprise thought political work. Enterprise Party Committee Secretaries and managers must work closely together, share the same goals, and work together with the workers to overcome difficulties and ensure the completion of this year's tasks.

Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government held this industrial enterprise thought political work conference as a concrete step to implement the Central Committee's instructions on strengthening Party building and relying on the working class wholeheartedly. In the past two months, the municipal leaders have conducted extensive investigations and research at the grassroots level and held discussions with more than 100 enterprise Party and government cadres to explore ways to strengthen thought political work.

The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government believe that the current severe situation in industrial production and the weak state of enterprise thought political work urgently require enterprise Party and government cadres to carry out targeted thought political work, especially to address three aspects of ideological understanding.

Regarding the issue of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government emphasized that it is necessary to ensure the socialist direction of the enterprise from a high level, consciously grasp and implement it, and persist in it. Currently, education on the Four Cardinal Principles for workers must start from national conditions; it is necessary to combine the education on the Four Cardinal Principles with the enthusiasm of cadres and workers for patriotism; it is necessary to clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization and organically combine the Four Cardinal Principles with reform and opening up, and implement them in the various work of the enterprise.

Regarding the issue of playing the role of large and medium-sized enterprises, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government proposed that during the period of rectification and rectification, large and medium-sized enterprises must maintain an appropriate production growth rate, prevent economic slippage, and do everything possible to improve economic efficiency, providing a material basis for rectification and rectification. Enterprises must learn to survive in adversity, strive to adjust the product structure, and improve adaptability. Currently, it is necessary to change the idea of revitalizing large and medium-sized enterprises from "decentralization and empowerment" to a combination of state support for enterprises and the improvement of internal mechanisms of enterprises, and a combination of planned economy and market regulation, truly focusing on improving economic efficiency and the ability of self-development and self-discipline. It is necessary to rely on mobilizing people's enthusiasm to seek vitality, rely on producing marketable products, increasing exports, and earning more foreign exchange to seek vitality, and rely on adjusting the organizational structure of enterprises and strengthening internal management of enterprises to seek vitality. Political management departments should also create conditions for enterprises from the external environment.

Regarding the issue of advocating hard work and living frugally for a few years, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government pointed out that at present, in order to overcome difficulties, it is necessary to carry out the "double increase and double saving" campaign thoroughly, fully tap potential, open up sources, and save on expenditures, and strive to achieve the maximum economic benefits with the least input. In the current sluggish market situation, it is necessary to do everything possible to organize sales activities, actively carry out rationalization suggestions and small improvements and reforms, organize surplus labor, utilize idle equipment and leftover materials, produce small products that the market needs, and reduce production stoppages as much as possible. All levels of Party and government leaders should fully pay attention to the problem of the rapid growth of consumption funds, consciously enhance the awareness of control, and strengthen the education of the situation for the workers, turning the idea of living frugally for a few years into a conscious demand of the masses.

The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government particularly pointed out that it is not contradictory to clarify the political core position of the Party organization and to implement the manager's responsibility system with the manager as the center, and the purpose is to run a socialist enterprise well. "Two hearts" should be turned into "one heart." Party Committee Secretaries and managers should jointly assume the responsibility of strengthening thought political work on different positions.

　　上海工业企业思想政治工作会议强调
　　书记厂长齐心协力办好企业
　　市委市政府号召职工振奋精神完成今年各项任务
    本报上海10月24日电　记者章世鸿报道：上海市委书记、市长朱熔基今天在全市企业思想政治工作会议上说，要充分认识加强党的领导、加强企业思想政治工作的紧迫性，企业党委书记和厂长要紧密配合，齐心协力，与职工同甘共苦，战胜困难，确保今年各项任务的完成。
    上海市召开这个工业企业思想政治工作会议，是市委、市政府贯彻中央关于加强党的建设指示精神、全心全意依靠工人阶级的切实步骤。近两个月来，市委市政府领导深入基层进行广泛的调查研究，并先后同100多名企业党政干部座谈，共同探索加强思想政治工作的途径。
    上海市委、市政府认为，当前工业生产面临的严峻形势和企业思想政治工作薄弱的现状，都迫切要求企业党政干部有针对性地开展思想政治工作，特别要注意解决好三个方面的思想认识问题。
    关于坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的问题。上海市委、市政府强调，一定要从保证企业社会主义方向的高度，自觉地抓好抓实，常抓不懈。当前对职工进行四项基本原则教育，必须注意从国情教育入手；要注意把四项基本原则教育同激发干部职工的爱国主义感情结合起来；要旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，把四项基本原则和改革开放有机地统一起来，落实到企业的各项工作中去。
    关于发挥大中型企业骨干作用的问题，上海市委、市政府提出，在治理整顿期间，大中型企业必须保持适当的生产增长速度，防止经济滑坡，千方百计地把经济效益搞上去，为治理整顿提供物质基础。企业要在困境中学会生存，努力调整产品结构，提高应变能力。当前，要把搞活大中型企业的思路从“扩权、放权”转变到国家扶持企业与企业完善内部机制相结合、计划经济与市场调节相结合的思路上来，真正把着眼点放在提高经济效益和自我发展、自我约束的能力上来。要靠调动人的积极性求活力，靠生产适销对路产品、多出口、多创汇求活力，靠调整企业组织结构、加强企业内部管理求活力，政治管理部门也要从外部环境上为企业创造条件。
    关于提倡艰苦奋斗、过几年紧日子的问题，上海市委、市政府指出，目前，为了克服困难，要深入开展双增双节，充分挖潜，开源节流，努力以最少的投入取得最大的经济效益。在当前市场疲软的情况下，要千方百计组织推销活动，积极开展合理化建议和小改小革活动，组织富余劳力，利用闲置设备和边角余料，生产市场需要的小产品，尽量减少生产性停工。各级党政领导都应充分重视消费基金增长过快的问题，自觉地增强控制意识，并加强对职工的形势教育，把过几年紧日子化为群众的自觉要求。
    市委、市政府特别指出，明确党组织的政治核心地位，和实行厂长负责制、以厂长为中心是不矛盾的，目的都是为了办好社会主义企业，“两心”要变为“一心”。党委书记和厂长要在不同岗位上共同承担起加强思想政治工作的责任来。
