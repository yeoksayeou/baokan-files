Today marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. Over the past 40 years, socialism has taken deep root and flourished in the German Democratic Republic.

Rebuilding the Homeland from Ruins

Fascist Germany, during the Second World War, launched a frenzied invasion of many European countries, bringing immense suffering to hundreds of millions of people. The German people also suffered greatly. In the region where the Democratic Republic of Germany is located, 40% of industrial equipment (including more than 70% of heavy industry equipment), 60% of transportation equipment, 30% of agricultural machinery, and 40% of housing were severely damaged.

After the war, the people of Democratic Germany first carried out land reforms in rural areas, implemented the nationalization of basic means of production, confiscated the factories and mines of war criminals and monopolists, and established state-owned enterprises. Additionally, banks, transportation, and postal and telecommunications were also nationalized. The workers and peasants controlled and managed the lifeblood of the national economy. However, Democratic Germany did not eliminate all private economies. In the national economy, a certain number of private individual economies still exist. They believe that under the condition that the socialist economic component is dominant, the existence of a small amount of private individual economy can play a supplementary role to the socialist economy.

The entire nation united, withstood various pressures, and endured countless hardships to rebuild their homeland from the ruins. By 1950, industrial and agricultural production had basically returned to pre-war levels.

In 1951, the first five-year plan was implemented, concentrating the nation's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to prioritize the development of heavy industry. Despite encountering many difficulties, through the arduous efforts of the entire nation, in less than two five-year plans, a relatively complete industrial system that could adapt to economic development was established.

Steady and Stable Economic Development

The speed of economic development in the Democratic Republic of Germany is relatively fast. From 1950 to 1970, the national income increased by twofold, with an average annual growth rate of 7.2%. In 1971, the Democratic Republic of Germany entered a new development period. From 1971 to 1986, the national income doubled again, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6%. In 1987 and 1988, it grew by 4% and 3%, respectively.

The growth of the national income in the Democratic Republic of Germany is mainly achieved by increasing labor productivity. Over the years, increasing labor productivity has been the core of the economic policy of the Democratic Republic of Germany. Due to the continuous improvement of labor productivity, the gap between the labor productivity level of the Democratic Republic of Germany and that of the Federal Republic of Germany is narrowing. In 1950, the Democratic Republic of Germany's labor productivity level was only 45% of that of the Federal Republic of Germany. By 1988, it had reached about 70%, roughly equal to the labor productivity level of Britain, the highest among the Soviet and Eastern European countries. In 1988, the per capita national income was 16,166 Marks (approximately $8,000). The Democratic Republic of Germany has already ranked among the world's developed industrial countries.

Emphasis on Education and Science and Technology

The long-term stable development of the economy in the Democratic Republic of Germany is inseparable from the vigorous development of education and science and technology. Over the years, the Democratic Republic of Germany has attached importance to the development of intelligence and talent cultivation. The investment in education accounts for about 6% to 7% of the national income, and its growth rate is generally faster than the growth rate of national income and national economic investment. In recent years, the country has universally implemented a ten-year compulsory education system. Vocational training and higher education have also been well developed. In 1987, there were 174.9 college and university students per 10,000 people nationwide. The scientific and cultural level of workers is high, with 21.6% being college graduates and 60.7% being skilled workers.

The party and government regard technological research as an important means of developing productivity and believe that the development of the national economy and the improvement of its production level are increasingly dependent on the achievements of scientific and technological progress. The state's expenditure on science and technology and development is increasing year by year, accounting for about 3% of the national income in the 1960s and increasing to more than 4% in the 1970s, approaching the level of advanced countries in the world. The development of science and technology has become the most important means for the Democratic Republic of Germany to improve labor productivity and increase new products. More than 90% of the increase in labor productivity is achieved through the application of scientific and technological achievements, and the renewal rate of industrial products has reached about 30%.

Vigorously Developing Agriculture

The Democratic Republic of Germany attaches great importance to agricultural production. They believe that agriculture plays a crucial role in the national economy and is closely related to the lives of residents. Therefore, they have made great efforts to develop agricultural production. Livestock farming has developed rapidly, accounting for about two-thirds of the total agricultural output value. Over the years, meat, eggs, milk, and butter have been self-sufficient and surplus. The planting industry is relatively developed, and since 1982, the grain output has exceeded 10 million tons each year. In 1988, the per capita grain output was approximately 600 kilograms.

Agricultural production in the Democratic Republic of Germany has been modernized, with high levels of mechanization and chemicalization.

With the development of agricultural production, the rural landscape has undergone tremendous changes. Since the 1970s, agricultural production cooperatives, like state-owned farms, have also implemented a wage system. The income of farmers is almost the same as that of workers, and they enjoy roughly the same benefits. The gap between urban and rural areas has become very small.

Continuously Improving Living Standards

The average monthly income of workers in the Democratic Republic of Germany has been steadily increasing. In 1950, it was 311 Marks, in 1970 it was 755 Marks, in 1987 it was 1233 Marks, and in the first half of 1989, it increased again. Over the years, the state has implemented a stable policy on the prices of basic consumer goods, and the prices of major foods and daily necessities as well as service charges have remained basically unchanged. The market supply is relatively abundant. Residents' housing is spacious, with an average of 27 square meters per person currently. Rent is low, accounting for about 3% of the household income of workers.

The structure of residents' food consumption has undergone significant changes. Meat, dairy, eggs, and butter, and other livestock products account for about 40% of the food, which is a high level internationally. In 1987, the average consumption per person was 99.4 kilograms of meat and meat products, 7.9 kilograms of fish and fish products, 303 eggs, 15.5 kilograms of butter, 10.3 kilograms of margarine, and 108.3 liters of milk. The proportion of high-end household consumer goods is relatively high. In 1987, among every 100 households, there were 52.6 cars, 152.1 refrigerators, 104.6 washing machines, 121.6 televisions, of which 47.1 were color televisions. Since 1967, a five-day workweek has been implemented. Since 1976, workers have worked 42 hours per week, and shift workers have worked 40 hours. Since 1979, workers have had 21 days of annual leave.

The people of the Democratic Republic of Germany are strengthening unity under the leadership of the party, further promoting economic and cultural construction, striving to consolidate and develop the achievements of socialism, and fighting to safeguard world peace.

    民主德国光辉的四十年
    魏斯
    今天是德意志民主共和国诞生40周年的日子。40年来，社会主义已经在德意志民主共和国深深地扎根并茁壮成长。
    在废墟上重建家园
    法西斯德国在第二次世界大战中疯狂地侵略了许多欧洲国家，给亿万人民带来深重灾难，德国人民也深受其害。民主德国所在地区40％的工业设备（其中重工业设备70％多）、60％的交通运输设备、30％的农业机械和40％的住房遭到严重破坏。
    战后，民主德国人民首先在农村进行了土地改革，同时实行基本生产资料国有化，没收战犯和垄断资本家的厂矿企业，建立起国营企业。此外，银行、交通运输和邮政电信也实行了国有化。工农国家掌握和控制了发展国民经济的命脉。然而，民主德国没有走消灭一切私有经济的道路，在国民经济中至今仍然保留一定数量的私人个体经济。他们认为，在社会主义经济成分占统治地位的条件下，少量的私人个体经济存在，能够对社会主义经济起补充作用。
    全国人民同心同德，顶住各种压力，历尽千辛万苦，在废墟上重建了家园，1950年工农业生产就基本上达到了战前水平。
    1951年开始实行第一个五年计划，集中全国人力、物力和财力，优先发展重工业，尽管遇到许多困难，但经过全国人民艰苦努力，在不到两个五年计划的时间，就建成了能够适应经济发展的比较完整的工业体系。
    持续和稳定地发展经济
    民主德国经济发展的速度是比较快的，1950——1970年生产性国民收入翻了两番，每年平均增长7.2％。1971年民主德国进入一个新的发展时期。这一年至1986年，生产性国民收入又翻了一番，每年平均增长4.6％，1987年和1988年又分别增长4％和3％。
    民主德国国民收入的增长主要是靠提高劳动生产率取得的。多年来，提高劳动生产率一直是民主德国经济政策的核心。由于劳动生产率的不断提高，民主德国与联邦德国劳动生产率水平的差距正在缩小，1950年民主德国仅相当于联邦德国劳动生产率水平的45％，1988年已达70％左右，跟英国的劳动生产率水平大致相等，在苏联东欧国家中是最高的。1988年按人口平均计算的国民收入为16166马克（约合8000美元）。民主德国已居于世界发达工业国家之列。
      重视教育和科学技术
    民主德国经济长期稳定发展是与大力发展教育、科学技术分不开的。多年来，民主德国重视智力开发和人才培养，教育投资约占国民收入的6％—7％，其增长速度一般都比国民收入和国民经济投资的增长速度为快。近年来全国已普遍实行十年制义务教育，职业培训和高等教育也得到了很好的发展，1987年全国居民中每万人有174.9名大专院校学生。职工的科学文化水平较高，其中大专院校毕业生占21.6％，技术工人占60.7％。
    党和政府把技术研究工作视为发展生产力的重要手段，认为国民经济的发展及其生产水平提高越来越取决于科学技术进步的成果。国家用于科学技术与开发的经费不断增加，60年代每年约占当年国民收入的3％，70年代以来增加为4％多，接近世界先进国家水平。发展科学技术已成为民主德国提高劳动生产率和增加新产品的最重要手段，劳动生产率增加的90％以上是通过运用科学技术成果取得的，工业产品更新率已高达30％左右。
    大力发展农业
    民主德国非常重视农业生产。他们认为，农业在国民经济中有着举足轻重的作用，尤其与居民的生活息息相关。因此，他们下大力气抓农业生产。畜牧业上得较快，在农业总产值中约占2／3。多年来，肉、蛋、奶、黄油已自给有余。种植业较发达，1982年以来，谷物产量每年都超过1000万吨。1988年按人口平均计算的谷物产量约600公斤。
    民主德国农业生产已实现现代化，农业机械化、化学化水平很高。
    随着农业生产的发展，农村面貌发生巨大变化。70年代以来，农业生产合作社跟国营农场一样，也实行工资制，农民的收入跟职工的收入相差无几，两者享受大体相同的福利。城乡差别已经很小。
    居民生活水平不断提高
    民主德国职工月平均收入不断提高，1950年为311马克，1970年为755马克，1987年为1233马克，1989年上半年又有增长。多年来，国家实行基本消费品价格稳定政策，主要食品和日用消费品价格以及服务收费指数基本上未变动。市场供应是比较充裕的。居民住房宽敞，目前人均达27平方米，房租较低，约占职工家庭收入的3％左右。
    居民的食品结构发生了巨大变化，肉、奶、蛋和黄油等畜产品在食品中所占比重约为40％，在国际上是高水平的。1987年每人平均消费肉和肉制品99.4公斤，鱼和鱼制品7.9公斤，蛋和蛋制品303个，黄油15.5公斤，人造黄油10.3公斤，牛奶108.3公升。家用高档消费品占的比例较高，1987年每百户家庭中，有小汽车52.6辆，冰箱152.1台，洗衣机104.6台，电视机121.6台，其中彩电47.1台。1967年起实行5日工作周。1976年起工人每周工作42小时，轮班工人为40小时。1979年起职工每年休假日期为21天。
    民主德国人民正在党的领导下加强团结，进一步推进经济、文化建设，为巩固和发展社会主义的成果，为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
