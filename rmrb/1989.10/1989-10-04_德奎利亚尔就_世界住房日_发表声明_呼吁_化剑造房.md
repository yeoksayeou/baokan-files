	De Cuellar Issues Statement on "World Habitat Day"
	Calls for "Turning Swords into Ploughshares"

	UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar today issued a statement on the occasion of "World Habitat Day," calling on the international community to redouble its efforts to provide housing for individuals and families.

	De Cuellar said that more than 1 billion people in the world today lack adequate housing, and hundreds of millions are crowded into slums with poor living conditions. Due to the influx of people into cities, several million more become homeless each year. This situation can lead to the spread of diseases and family instability.

	After discussing the fact that a significant portion of the world's resources are wasted on the production of weapons of war, de Cuellar called for a change in this situation. "Let us change this situation -- make bricks instead of bombs; build houses instead of guns; everyone works together to build homes and settle down."

    德奎利亚尔就“世界住房日”发表声明
    呼吁“化剑造房”
    本报联合国10月2日电　记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天在纪念“世界住房日”之际发表声明，呼吁国际社会为提供个人和家庭住房而加倍努力。
    德奎利亚尔说，当今世界上有10亿以上的人没有足够的住房，几亿人挤在居住条件恶劣的贫民区，由于人们拥入城市，每年又有几百万人成为新的无家可归者。这会引起疾病流行，家庭生活不安定。
    德奎利亚尔在谈了世界上相当多的一部分资源浪费于制造战争武器上的情况后号召“让我们改变这种情况——造砖瓦，而不是造炸弹；造房住，而不是造枪炮；大家努力造房安家”。
