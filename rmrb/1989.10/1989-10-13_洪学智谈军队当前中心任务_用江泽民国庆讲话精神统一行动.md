Central Military Commission Vice Secretary Hong Xuezhi recently, while inspecting troops stationed in the Yan Mountain region, pointed out that the army's current central task is to study Jiang Zemin General Secretary's National Day speech thoroughly. The spirit of the speech should be used to unify thoughts and actions, strengthen party building and discipline, and effectively build up the troops.

Hong Xuezhi emphasized that the study of Jiang Zemin General Secretary's speech must be combined with the actual work and thoughts of the troops, and must yield results. He said that the counterrevolutionary rebellion in Beijing shows that domestic and foreign hostile forces have not given up their intentions to destroy us. They have been conducting "peaceful evolution" and sabotage activities against our country, attempting to overthrow our socialist system. It must be recognized that the tasks of the army in peacetime are not lighter but heavier. Defending national security and the Four Modernizations is the sacred duty of the army, and vigilance must never be relaxed at any time.

Hong Xuezhi inspected the troops' agricultural and sideline production bases. He said that the country is still not rich, and there are many difficulties in reform and construction. We should have the spirit of hard struggle, develop agricultural and sideline production, improve economic benefits, and reduce the burden on the state. Fighting for the people's interests and the country's interests is a very glorious cause.

    洪学智谈军队当前中心任务
    用江泽民国庆讲话精神统一行动
    新华社北京10月12日电　中央军委副秘书长洪学智近日在视察驻燕山地区部队时指出，军队当前的中心任务是学好江泽民总书记的国庆讲话，用讲话精神统一思想，统一行动，加强党的建设、作风纪律建设，切实把部队建设好。
    洪学智强调，学习江泽民总书记的讲话，一定要结合部队的工作实际，思想实际，要见成效。他说，北京发生反革命暴乱的事实说明，国内外敌对势力亡我之心不死，他们一直在对我国进行“和平演变”和破坏活动，妄图颠覆我国的社会主义制度。必须看到，和平时期军队的任务不是减轻了，而是更重了。保卫祖国安全，保卫四化建设，是军队的神圣职责，任何时候都不能放松警惕。
    洪学智察看了部队的农副业生产基地。他说，目前国家还不富裕，改革和建设还有许多困难，我们应当有志气，发扬艰苦奋斗精神，搞好农副业生产，提高经济效益，减轻国家的负担。我们当兵为人民利益为国家利益而奋斗，是非常光荣的。
