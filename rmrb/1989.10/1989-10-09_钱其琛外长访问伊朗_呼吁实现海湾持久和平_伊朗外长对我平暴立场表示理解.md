Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is visiting Iran, today called on Iran and Iraq to make greater efforts to push forward the stalled peace talks and achieve enduring peace in the Gulf region.

Qian made the remarks during his first round of talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati. He said that continuing the war was "unimaginable." The current state of neither war nor peace was not conducive to the post-war reconstruction efforts of Iran and Iraq.

He urged Tehran and Baghdad to cooperate with UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar to push forward the stalled peace talks and seek a resolution to the conflict based on UN Security Council Resolution 598.

He said that Iran and Iraq are both friendly countries to China. He also said that as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China would continue to support the peace efforts of the UN Secretary-General and make greater contributions to peace and stability in the Gulf region.

Velayati expressed appreciation for China's peace efforts and support for the implementation of Resolution 598 and strengthening the role of the UN Secretary-General.

Qian also briefed Velayati on the recent situation in China, condemning some Western countries for instigating unrest and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. He said, "China will not change its course and will withstand the pressure from some Western countries."

In discussing U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Panama, Iran, and other countries, he pointed out that the pressure the U.S. is exerting on China is also doomed to fail.

Velayati expressed understanding and support for China's firm stance in handling the unrest and counter-revolutionary riots, and supported the measures China has taken to restore order and achieve stability.

The two foreign ministers also discussed Middle East issues, the Lebanese problem, and the Afghan crisis during their 80-minute talks.

After the talks, Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani met with Qian and expressed satisfaction with the "very friendly" relations between Iran and China.

During his visit, Qian will also hold talks with Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and other Iranian officials to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of common concern.

Qian arrived in Tehran late last night, beginning a three-day visit to Iran.

Qian was welcomed at the airport by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati.

This is Qian's first visit to Iran since he took office as foreign minister in 1988.

Qian told reporters at the airport that he hoped this visit would lead to a better understanding between the two countries and closer cooperation.

He said that China and Iran have very good political and economic relations.

    伊朗外长对我平暴立场表示理解
    新华社德黑兰10月7日电  正在伊朗访问的中国外交部长钱其琛今天呼吁伊朗和伊拉克作出更大的努力，推动陷入僵局的和平谈判，实现海湾地区的持久和平。
    钱其琛外长在与伊朗外长韦拉亚提举行第一轮会谈时说，继续战争是“不可想象的”。目前不战不和的状态不利于伊朗和伊拉克的战后重建工作。
    他要求德黑兰和巴格达同联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔合作，推动陷于僵局的和平谈判，在联合国安理会598号决议的基础上，寻求冲突的解决。
    他说，伊朗和伊拉克都是中国的友好国家。他还说，作为联合国安理会常任理事国，中国将继续支持联合国秘书长的和平努力，为海湾地区的和平与稳定作出更大的贡献。
    韦拉亚提对中国的和平努力与赞成实施598号决议和加强联合国秘书长的作用表示赞赏。
    钱其琛还向韦拉亚提介绍了中国最近的形势，谴责一些西方国家怂恿北京的动乱和反革命暴乱。他说：“中国决不改变其方向，将顶住来自一些西方国家的压力。”
    在谈到美国干涉巴拿马、伊朗和其他一些国家的内部事务时，他指出，美国给中国施加的压力也是注定要失败的。
    韦拉亚提对中国在处理动乱和反革命暴乱上的坚定立场表示理解，支持中国为恢复秩序和实现安定所采取的措施。
    两国外长在80分钟的会谈中还讨论了中东问题、黎巴嫩问题和阿富汗危机。
    会谈后，伊朗议长卡鲁比接见了钱其琛外长，并对伊朗和中国之间“非常友好的关系”表示满意。
    访问期间，钱其琛外长还将与伊朗总统拉夫桑贾尼和其他伊朗官员举行会谈，讨论双边关系和共同关心的国际问题。
    新华社德黑兰10月7日电  中国外长钱其琛昨天深夜到达这里，开始对伊朗进行为期3 天的访问。
    钱其琛外长在机场受到了伊朗外长韦拉亚提的欢迎。
    这是钱外长自1988年担任外长以来第一次访问伊朗。
    钱外长在机场对记者说，希望通过这次访问，两国将彼此比以前更加理解，两国间的合作更加密切。
