In the year marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, a new wave of fashion culture unprecedented in scale has swept across the vast land of China.

**Fashion Trends: The Main Orientation of the Garment Market**

Today, China is transitioning from a state of mere subsistence to one of relative prosperity. The level of clothing consumption has significantly improved. The total retail sales of clothing nationwide increased from 41.4 billion yuan in 1980 to 107 billion yuan in 1988, a growth of 1.6 times. Particularly among urban youth, clothing concepts have subtly evolved: emphasizing individuality and pursuing fashion. A 1986 survey in Shanghai found that 54.5% of respondents valued fashion. A 1988 survey in Beijing revealed that 61% of young people and 25% of middle-aged individuals prioritized fashion.

To guide appropriate civilized consumption and scientifically direct production, the state included "Fashion Trend Forecasting" as one of the key projects in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." The China Garment Research and Design Center coordinated with garment companies and research institutes in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian, Guangzhou, and Jiangsu, as well as the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, to undertake this project. Since 1986, following international conventions, fashion trends have been released twice a year, guiding new trends in colors, fabrics, and styles. Although this initiative started late in China, the response has been strong. Dalian and Shanghai, among other places, have used these results to hold fashion garment release and ordering meetings, each breaking the 800 million to 1 billion yuan mark, thereby creating a synchronized fashion trend in nine provinces and municipalities.

**Chinese Garment Industry Goes Global**

In the past, when a delegation of Chinese garment designers visited Paris, a French friend asked, "Do you wear suits and leather shoes when you go abroad, and traditional Chinese clothing at home?" Despite being known as the "Kingdom of Clothing," China's image in the eyes of foreigners was shaped by decades of isolation. Today, various types of Chinese garments are exported to over 160 countries and regions, earning over $4 billion in foreign exchange last year, accounting for more than 10% of the country's total export earnings. In the past, most of China's exported garments were not considered high-end and were often relegated to the category of mass-market or street-vendor goods. The reform and opening-up policy has paved the way for Chinese garments to enter the ranks of the world's advanced fashion industry. In September 1985, the Chinese Garment Industry Delegation participated in the 50th Paris International Women's Fashion Fair, followed by showcases in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Milan, Moscow, New York, Bucharest, Algiers, and other cities. In 1987, another peak was reached when the Chinese Garment Performance Team, wearing designs by young Shanghai designer Chen Shanhua, made a splash at the second International Fashion Festival in Paris, known as the "World Fashion Olympics," winning widespread acclaim.

**New Leap in Garment Design Thought**

In recent years, it is not an exaggeration to say that a "garment fever" has swept the nation. In 1985, the state established the biennial "Golden Scissors Award" for national garment design. Various regions across the country have followed suit, with incomplete statistics showing over 60-70 garment design competitions such as the "Lotus Cup," "Black Gold Cup," "Sky Pool Cup," and "Hope Cup." Shortly after the reform and opening-up, China's first garment performance team, the Shanghai Garment Company Performance Team, emerged. In just four to five years, there are now over 20 influential garment performance teams nationwide, not to mention countless amateur groups. The Beijing amateur senior garment performance team includes many members with high academic titles such as associate researchers and associate professors, ranging from those in their sixties to those in their seventies. The Tianjin Garment Performance Team's performances in rural areas have been so popular that farmers eagerly buy tickets, and every show is sold out. The aesthetic tastes of the general consumers have significantly improved, and garment design thinking has also taken a new leap, marked by three main features: simplicity with novelty, rusticity with elegance, and practicality within series. This has changed the traditional design concept of "the more intricate, the newer; the more flashy, the more beautiful."

Currently, the China Garment Research and Design Center, along with 105 garment research institutes nationwide, has initially formed a multi-level garment research network. Garment factories in cities like Tianjin and Qingdao have successively established garment research institutes, continuously developing new products.

　　八十年代的我国服装业
　　谭安
    在建国四十周年的喜庆之年，一股前所未有的服饰文化新潮席卷神州大地。
    讲流行——服装市场的主要倾向
    而今，我国由温饱型向小康型过渡，人们的服饰消费水平有了明显提高，全国衣着类零售总额从1980年的414亿元，提高到1988年的1070亿元，增长1.6倍，尤其是城镇青年的衣着观念潜移默化地更新：显示个性，追求流行。1986年上海调查，讲流行的占54.5％。1988年北京问卷调查，讲究流行的年青人占61％，中年也占25％之多。
    为了正确引导适度的文明消费，科学引导生产，国家把“服装流行趋势预测”列入“七五”重点攻关项目之一。由中国服装研究设计中心协调上海、北京、天津、大连、广州、江苏服装工业公司和服装研究所以及北京服装学院承担这个课题。自1986年起，顺应着国际惯例，每年两度发布服装流行趋势，引导色彩、衣料、造型的新潮流。此举尽管在我国起步较晚，反应却十分强烈。大连、上海等地运用其成果召开流行服装发布订货会，分别一次破8000万元至一亿元大关，进而形成了九省市区和十省市区同步发布订货的“小气候”。
      中国服装开始走向世界
      前些年中国服装设计师考察小组出访巴黎时，有位法国朋友竟问：“您们出国穿西服革履，在国内是否着长袍马褂？”素有“衣冠王国”之称的中国，在外国人眼里竟是这个形象，这是我们闭关锁国几十年的结果！如今我国各种服装出口160多个国家和地区，去年创汇过40亿美元大关，占全国出口创汇的10％以上。过去，我国出口服装多数登不上大雅之堂，只好委身于大路货、地摊货之列。改革开放为中国服装跻身于世界先进之林搭桥铺路。1985年9月，中国服装工业代表团首次赴法国参加第50届巴黎国际女装博览会，继而先后向香港、东京、米兰、莫斯科、纽约、布加勒斯特、阿尔及尔等地展示了我国服装的风姿。1987年出现了又一个高潮，在号称“世界服装奥林匹克”的第二届国际时装节上，中国服装表演队穿着上海年轻设计师陈珊华设计的红黑系列礼服，轰动了巴黎，赢得了殊荣。
      服装设计思想的新飞跃
      近几年来，说全国出现了“服装热”并不过分。1985年国家设置了两年一度的全国服装设计“金剪奖”大赛。全国各地也相继“热”了起来，据不完全统计，“芙蓉杯”、“乌金杯”、“天池杯”、“希望杯”等等服装设计比赛达六七十种之多。改革开放不久，我国第一支服装表演队——上海服装公司表演队破土而出。仅四五年的光景，全国较为有影响的服装表演队就有二十几支之多，至于业余表演团体则无计其数。北京业余中老年服装表演队队员中副研究员、副教授以上高级职称者居多，不仅有年逾花甲的老者，尚有年过古稀之长辈。天津服装表演队到郊区演出，农民争相买票，场场爆满。广大消费者的审美情趣大为提高，服装设计思想也产生了新的飞跃，其主要标志有三个：一是简练中求新颖；二是质朴中求高雅；三是系列中求实效。它改变着沿袭下来的“越繁琐越新，越花哨越美，”的传统设计观念。
      目前，中国服装研究设计中心，与全国105个服装研究所初步形成了多层次的服装科研网络。天津、青岛等地的一些服装工厂相继设置了服装研究所，新产品开发源源不断。
