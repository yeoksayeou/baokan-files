A deafening explosion of natural gas shook the Karamay Power Plant. The plant building was damaged, the unit stopped operating, and production in many departments of the oil field was forced to halt.

Such a heavy loss was caused by something so simple—a minority worker opened the wrong valve.

The accident occurred on August 15, 1984.

Facing the accident, the decision-makers of the oil city were unable to eat or sleep peacefully. While handling the accident and restoring production, they looked beyond the surface phenomena to find the deep-rooted causes of the accident. The leaders believed that due to historical and regional reasons, the cultural and technical skills of minority workers did not meet the requirements of their technical jobs. They must strive to improve enterprise culture during the activities promoting ethnic unity and progress, especially focusing on improving the cultural and technical skills of minority workers.

Thus, a minority education project, which would influence generations of workers and relate to the oil field's long-term planning, gradually took shape in the aftermath of the explosion.

To cultivate high and mid-level technical talents, the Petroleum Bureau partnered with over 50 higher education institutions in inland China to train minority technical cadres. The 50 affiliated factories and departments set up literacy classes, supplementary classes, training classes, and night schools, combining off-site learning with on-the-job training. Many minority workers paired up with Han workers, helping and learning from each other to make progress together. Over the past five years, more than 20,000 minority workers in the oil field have undergone training.

So many people were pulled out for training, but how would production be affected? Many Han workers on duty volunteered, "Training is important; we'll handle the work!" As a result, more than 10,000 teams across the bureau did not experience any production issues due to minority workers being pulled out for training.

Some minority workers sent to study at higher education institutions in other regions had families back home with wives, children, and elderly parents. Without them even asking, various levels of party, government, and trade union organizations made arrangements. If someone fell ill, there was someone to visit; if the house leaked, there was someone to repair it.

The organization's care and the support from Han compatriots deeply moved the minority workers, who became even more diligent. The Geological Survey Department had many Uyghur workers. Due to the lack of Uyghur-language materials, minority workers found it very difficult to learn technology. Uyghur cadre Juma Hong, who had limited proficiency in Chinese, took on the responsibility of compiling the "Han-Uyghur Geological Exploration Terminology Dictionary." To complete this book, Juma Hong sought teachers everywhere and worked day and night. By last October, this 16-opening, 296-page book was distributed to every minority worker in the Geological Survey Department.

It was thanks to the hard work of many "Juma Hongs" that the oil field's translation of materials became a miracle. By now, more than 10 million words of various technical materials have been translated, and 110,000 books have been printed. The first Chinese "Uyghur-Han Petroleum Dictionary" with over 20,000 entries was compiled by 11 workers from the oil field.

As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." After five years, the cultural and technical skills of minority workers in the Xinjiang Petroleum Bureau have significantly improved. In last year's professional technical position evaluations, 3,132 minority workers obtained corresponding technical positions, with an average of one professional technical worker for every seven minority workers. Ordinary workers on the front lines have also demonstrated their latent intelligence, driving the oil field's production onto a safe, high-quality, and efficient track. Take the power plant mentioned earlier, for instance; by now, it has safely supplied electricity for over 1,700 days, ranking at the top among similar power plants nationwide.

　　欲渡大川先凿舟
　　曾小全
    轰！一声天然气爆炸的巨响，在克拉玛依电厂剧烈震荡。厂房受损，机组停运，油田不少部门的生产被迫中断。
    如此惨重的损失，起因却那么简单——一个少数民族工人，开错了一个闸门。
    事故，发生在1984年8月15日。
    面对事故，油城的决策者们食不甘味、寝不安席。他们在处理事故、恢复生产的同时，透过表层现象，找出了引发事故的深层原因。领导们认为，由于历史的、地域的原因，少数民族职工的文化技术素质，与所担负的技术工作的要求，还存在着不小的差距。必须在民族团结进步活动中，努力抓好企业文化建设，尤其要在提高少数民族职工文化技术素质方面下功夫。
    于是，一个足以影响数代职工、关系油田百年之计的少数民族教育工程，在爆炸的冲击波中逐步落实了。
    为了培养高中级技术人才，石油局与内地50多所高等院校挂了钩，委托代培少数民族技术干部。局所属的50个厂处，则纷纷办起扫盲班、补习班、培训班和夜校，并把脱产学习和岗位练兵结合起来，许多少数民族职工与汉族职工自觉地结成对子，互帮互学，共同进步。五年来，油田两万多名少数民族职工全部轮训了一遍。
    这么多的人抽出来学习，生产怎么办？不少在岗的汉族职工拍着胸脯说：学习是大事，活儿咱包了！结果，全局一万多个班组，没有一个因少数民族职工抽出去学习而影响生产。
    一些到外地高等学府深造的少数民族职工，家中留有妻儿老母，不用他们提出要求，各级党政工团组织就作了安排，人病了，有人看望；屋漏了，有人修补。
    组织的关心，汉族同胞的支持，深深地感动了少数民族职工，他们更加发奋努力。地调处维吾尔族职工较多，由于缺乏维吾尔文资料，少数民族职工学习技术十分吃力，汉语程度不高的维吾尔族干部朱玛洪，毅然挑起了主持编写《汉维地质勘探术语对照》一书的重担。为了编好这本书，朱玛洪四处拜师学艺，夜以继日地工作，到去年10月，这本16开、296页的书籍，便发到了地调处每个少数民族职工手中。
    正是由于许许多多“朱玛洪”的辛勤工作，油田的资料翻译出现了奇迹。到现在，已翻译各种技术资料1000多万字，编印书籍11万册。我国第一部拥有两万多条词目的《维汉石油辞典》，就出于油田11位职工之手。
    俗话说，种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。五度春秋后的新疆石油局，少数民族职工的素质，得到明显提高。在去年评聘专业技术职务中，3132名少数民族职工获得了相应技术职务，平均每7个少数民族职工中，就有一个专业技术人员。战斗在平凡岗位上的普通职工，也发挥出了潜在的聪明才智，促使油田生产走上了安全、优质、高效的运行轨道。就说前面提到的电厂吧，截至目前，已安全发供电1700多天，在全国同类电厂中，位居前列。
