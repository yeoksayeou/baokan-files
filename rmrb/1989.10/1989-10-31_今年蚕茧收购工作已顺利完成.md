Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 30th.

The purchase of silkworm cocoons for this year has been successfully completed. According to the Xinhua News Agency, the reporter learned from the National Silkworm Cocoon and Silk Purchase Office that the purchase of silkworm cocoons nationwide has basically ended, with a good order and normal prices. The total purchase volume is expected to increase by more than 10% compared to last year.

The "silkworm cocoon wars" that continued for two years have been basically stopped this year, but in some areas, the situation of raising prices and rushing to purchase silkworm cocoons still occurs from time to time. Although the quality of the silkworm cocoons purchased this year is slightly better than last year, it is still not as good as in normal years and remains at a relatively low level.

　　今年蚕茧收购工作已顺利完成
    据新华社北京十月三十日电　（记者张毅）记者从全国茧丝绸收购办公室获悉，今年全国蚕茧收购工作已经基本结束，收购秩序良好，价格正常。预计总收购量比去年增加一成多。
    连续两年的“蚕茧大战”，今年基本得到制止，但在个别地区，抬价抢购蚕茧的情况仍时有发生。今年收购的蚕茧质量虽比去年稍有提高，但仍不如正常年份，处于较低的水平。
