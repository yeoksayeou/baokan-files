The First Asian Fencing Championship Opens; China's E Jie Wins Women's Foil Champion

	BEIJING, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- The first Asian Fencing Championship opened today at the newly completed Beiyuan Sports Hall in Beijing. Chinese fencer E Jie won the first gold medal of the championship in the women's foil event.

	Eighteen athletes participated in the women's foil event. After four rounds of competition, three Chinese athletes advanced to the semifinals. Tonight, the first semifinal match featured China's sixth National Games champion Sun Hongyun against South Korea's Shin Seong-ja. Shin, who finished 10th in this year's World Women's Foil Championship, had won all her previous matches. Sun, however, played cautiously and lost 6-8.

	E Jie defeated her teammate Xiao Aihua 8-4 and then faced Shin in the final.

	Both fencers engaged in aggressive attacks from the start, with the score remaining close. After tying at 3-3, E Jie successfully defended against several of Shin's fierce attacks. She used a strategy of defense and counterattack, frequently scoring with her low lunges, hitting her opponent's valid targets. Shin then appeared flustered. Seizing the opportunity, E Jie launched a counterattack and eventually won 8-5.

	E Jie, 22, is a Beijing native and this year's national champion. This is her first time achieving such a result in an international competition.

	The opening ceremony of the first Asian Fencing Championship was also held tonight.

	More than 100 athletes from nine countries and regions in Asia are participating in the first Asian Fencing Championship, competing for ten gold medals.

    第一届亚洲击剑锦标赛开幕
    中国鄂杰夺得女子花剑冠军
    本报北京10月8日讯　记者陈昭报道：第一届亚洲击剑锦标赛今天在新近竣工的北京木樨园体育馆开幕。中国女将鄂杰在女子花剑比赛中，夺得本届锦标赛的第一枚金牌。
    参加女子花剑比赛的共有18名选手，经过四轮比赛后，中国有3名选手进入半决赛。今晚半决赛首先由我国第六届全运会冠军孙洪云对南朝鲜的申成子。申成子是今年世界女子花剑锦标赛的第10名，在前几轮比赛中获全胜。孙洪云在与申成子的交锋中，打得比较拘谨，以6∶8败北。鄂杰以8∶4战胜队友肖爱华后，与申成子展开了决战。
    双方你来我往，一上剑台便展开了对攻，比分一直咬得很紧。鄂杰在与对手战成3∶3后，击退了申成子几次凶猛的进攻。她以静制动，利用防守反击频频得手，特别是她的下蹲突刺，连连刺中对方的有效部位。此后，申成子显得有些慌乱。鄂杰抓住机会，发起反击终于以8∶5战胜了申成子。
    鄂杰今年22岁，是一位北京姑娘，今年的全国冠军。这是她第一次在国际大赛中取得好成绩。
    今晚还举行了第一届亚洲击剑锦标赛的开幕式。
    参加首届亚洲击剑锦标赛的共有来自亚洲九个国家和地区的百余名选手，他们将争夺十个项目的金牌。
