At 9:30 AM on the 28th, as Ma Xiaochun placed a black stone on the light yellow chessboard, the curtain for the final of the second Jinlian Cup Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament finally rose. The swarm of journalists and chess enthusiasts from Zhengzhou made the once quiet Xiangjiang Grand Hotel bustling with activity.

Coincidentally, the final of the Japanese Weiqi Masters Tournament, sponsored by the Asahi Shimbun, was also being held at the same time. Despite leading with a three-win-one-loss record, challenger Tanroku Shūzo was still fighting with all his might, unwilling to give up the last chance to become the new Japanese master of 1989.

Although the new masters of China and Japan for 1989 have not yet been determined, the organizers of both countries have made meticulous arrangements for the future schedules of the new masters. The new masters from both countries will simultaneously announce their positions in Beijing and Tokyo on December 11th, and will also send congratulatory messages to each other to express their goodwill. The next day, the Japanese master will fly to Beijing to compete in the annual China-Japan Weiqi Masters Tournament with the Chinese master.

Liu Xiaoguang, the nine-dan player aiming to defend his title in his hometown, has always had a large group of loyal fans and admirers cheering him on, whether in Beijing, Hefei, or Hainan Island. This time, in Zhengzhou, facing Ma Xiaochun's challenge, the hometown elders' hearts will naturally lean towards Liu Xiaoguang. Moreover, Liu Xiaoguang did not participate in the grueling round-robin matches, resting and waiting for the opportunity, and after participating in the "Top Ten Tournament" and the national individual championship, he adjusted for a week, ready to fight with all his might.

The elegant Ma Xiaochun, a scholar from Jiangnan, emerged from the grueling battles of the round-robin matches, which included players like Nie Weiping, Qian Yiping, and Yu Bin, to secure the right to challenge. His strength is not to be underestimated. Ma Xiaochun said, "Although I do not have the advantages of local familiarity and public support in Zhengzhou, I believe that the opportunities for victory and defeat on the chessboard are the same for both of us!" His words and demeanor revealed a bold and ambitious spirit.

　　逐鹿中原
　　——琼联杯第二届中国围棋名人战决赛纪实（一）
　　本报记者　吴骅　缪鲁
    28日上午9时30分，随着马晓春在淡黄色的棋盘上轻轻落下一枚黑子，琼联杯第二届中国围棋名人战决赛的战幕终于拉开了。蜂拥而至的新闻记者和郑州棋迷们使曾经一度萧条的郑州香江大酒楼顿时热闹起来。
    无独有偶，由日本朝日新闻社主办的日本围棋名人战决赛此时也在同时举行，小林光一尽管以三胜一负的战绩暂时领先，挑战者淡路修三仍在全力以赴，不肯放弃获得日本1989年度新名人的最后一线希望。
    尽管中日两国1989年度的新名人尚未产生，但双方主办者却为两国新名人今后的日程做了周密的安排。
    双方新名人不仅12月11日同时在北京和东京正式宣布就位，而且还将互致贺电，以表心意。次日，日本名人将飞抵北京与中国名人进行一年一度的中日围棋名人战。
    志在家乡卫冕的刘小光九段，无论是在北京、合肥还是在海南岛，总是有一大批忠实的棋迷和崇拜者尾随助威，此次在郑州接受马晓春的挑战，家乡父老心理的天平自然会倒向刘小光。加之刘小光未参加循环圈的苦战，以逸待劳，前不久参加了“十强战”和全国个人赛后又调整了一周，可谓养精蓄锐，志在一搏。
    举止文雅的江南才子马晓春能从有聂卫平、钱宇平、俞斌等参加的循环圈中，历尽艰辛冲杀出来，夺得挑战权，其实力也非同一般。马晓春说：“郑州决战，我虽不占地利、人和之优势，但相信棋盘上的胜负机遇对两个人都是同样的！”言谈话语之中，流露出一股雄心勃勃的勇气。　（本报郑州10月28日专电）
