The Lao government attaches great importance to education, considering the cultivation of talents an essential part of national construction. It has put forth the slogan "Education Takes the Lead." In the past decade or so, Laos has made remarkable achievements in its educational undertakings.

In 1976, shortly after liberation, Laos abolished the old educational system and adopted a socialist educational system. Before liberation, primary education in Laos used the Lao language, while secondary education and above used French. The new system stipulated that Lao language be used from primary school to university nationwide. At the same time, new textbooks for primary, secondary, and higher education were compiled for nationwide use. Before liberation, Laos had general education and vocational education. After liberation, preschool education and national literacy campaigns were added.

It is estimated that at the time of liberation, about 90% of the population in Laos were illiterate. After ten years of effort, Laos declared in 1985 that it had basically eliminated illiteracy. General education, preschool education, and vocational education have also made significant progress. According to statistics, the number of primary school students increased from approximately 310,000 in the 1975-1976 academic year to 570,000 in the 1988-1989 academic year; the number of junior high school students increased from 26,000 to 93,000; and the number of senior high school students increased from 2,500 to 31,000. Currently, Laos has 6,316 primary schools, 676 junior high schools, 109 senior high schools, 3 regular universities, and 8 vocational schools. Primary, junior high, and senior high schools in Laos operate on a self-funded basis, while vocational schools and higher education institutions operate on a public-funded basis.

To further develop education, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers issued a resolution on "Educational Strategy" in 1986. Its purpose is to cultivate talents, reform education, and serve socialist construction. The main contents include: (1) Popularizing primary education nationwide. Children aged 6 to 14 must attend school. At the same time, mobilize cadres and people of all ethnic groups to study cultural and scientific knowledge and apply it to their work and life. County-level cadres should have a junior high school education; (2) Pay attention to preschool education in government agencies, factories, hospitals, and other departments, and continuously improve quality; (3) Reform vocational education and higher education, and cultivate talents loyal to the Party and the socialist motherland; (4) Pay attention to mountain area education; (5) Cultivate education management talents with both moral integrity and ability.

The Lao education sector attaches importance to the ideological and moral education of students, and relevant courses are offered in primary, secondary, and higher education. Primary schools offer a morality course, focusing on etiquette and law-abiding education. Junior high school students begin to learn the policies of the Party and the government, clarifying the "tasks of youth." Senior high school students and above further deepen their study of the policies and resolutions of the Party and the government, understand and learn philosophy, social sciences, and economics.

According to an official from the Lao Ministry of Education, Laos has made significant achievements in education. However, education still cannot meet the needs of national construction. Due to a lack of funds, the number of teachers and school buildings is still insufficient. Currently, Laos is implementing economic reforms and opening up to the outside world, and the national economy is presenting a new situation. It is reported that in the future, Laos will focus on cultivating specialized technical talents who are "loyal to the Party and the socialist motherland."

　　发展中的老挝教育事业
　　新华社记者　黄勇　本报记者　刘爱成
    老挝政府重视教育事业，把培养人才作为国家建设的重要一环，提出了“教育先走一步”的口号。最近十多年来，老挝的教育事业已取得可喜成果。
    解放初的1976年，老挝宣布废除旧的教育制度，实行社会主义的教育制度。解放前老挝只有小学用老挝语教学，初中以上均用法语。新制度规定全国从小学到大学一律使用老挝语教学。与此同时，重新编写大、中、小学教材，供全国使用。解放前，老挝教育包括普通教育、职业教育。解放后，增加幼儿教育和国民扫盲教育。
    据估计，解放初，老挝全国文盲占总人口的90％左右。经过十年努力，老挝于1985年宣布全国基本扫除了文盲。普通教育、幼儿教育和职业教育也已取得较大发展。据统计，1975—1976学年小学生人数约31万人，1988—1989学年增加到57万人；初中生从26000人增加到93000人；高中生从2500人增加到31000人。目前老挝共有小学6316所，初中676所，高中109所，正规大学3所和职业学校8所。老挝小学、初中、高中实行自费制，职业学校和高等学校实行公费制。
    为了进一步发展教育，老挝人民革命党中央和部长会议于1986年作出了关于
  “教育战略的决议”，其宗旨是：培养人才，改革教育，为社会主义建设服务。其主要内容包括：（一）在全国普及小学教育。6岁至14岁少年儿童必须就学。同时组织动员干部和各族人民群众学习文化知识和科学技术知识，并运用于自己的工作和生活。县级干部要具备初中文化水平；（二）重视机关、工厂、医院等部门的幼儿教育，不断提高质量；（三）改革职业教育和高等教育，培养忠于党和社会主义祖国的人才；（四）重视山区教育；（五）培养德才兼备的教育管理人才。
    老挝教育部门重视对学生的思想和道德教育，大、中、小学都开设有关课程。小学设道德课，着重进行礼貌、遵纪守法教育。初中开始学习党和政府的政策，明确“青年的任务”。高中以上的学生进一步加深学习党和政府的政策、决议，了解和学习哲学、社会科学和经济学。
    据老挝教育部的一位干部说，老挝教育取得了很大的成绩。但教育尚不能适应国家建设的需要。由于资金缺乏，教师、校舍数量尚显不足。目前，老挝正在实行经济改革和对外开放，国家经济建设出现了新的局面。据介绍，今后老挝教育将重点培养“忠于党和社会主义祖国”的专门技术人才。
