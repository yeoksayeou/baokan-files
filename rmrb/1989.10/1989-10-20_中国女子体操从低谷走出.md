China's women's gymnastics team last night in the all-around team competition among the four strongest teams of the Soviet Union, Romania, China, and the United States, with a total score of 392.116 points, defeated the American team of the same level, winning the second bronze medal since the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. After finishing sixth in the Seoul Olympics about a year ago, China's women's gymnastics team has climbed three steps, indicating that China's women's gymnastics has emerged from its low point and is beginning to recover, with its level approaching that of the Soviet Union and Romania.

Last night's competition among the top four teams was actually divided into two levels: the Soviet Union and Romania at one level, and China and the United States at a slightly lower level. China's team started with the balance beam. This draw was not favorable because if there was a fall from the balance beam, it would have an adverse effect on the subsequent three events. China's team started with veteran Fan Di. She moved gracefully, like flowing clouds and water, and landed a 720-degree backflip, only slightly adjusting her position, and succeeded! She scored 9.825 points. With this success, Li Yuyan performed the high-difficulty Silivas move, Yang Bo's form was beautiful, like the "flower-picking" in acrobatics, Chen Cuiting's "tiger leap," Ma Ying's split jump, and Wang Wenjing's "Lalat" all succeeded, containing many unique elements that could add points. The entire team had no failures, and from the start, they suppressed the American team by more than 2 points. Experts praised this opening as excellent, as it is rare to see every member succeed in the team all-around competition of the World Championships. After that, the Chinese girls were more relaxed in the other events. Ma Ying's vault had unique elements and difficulty; Chen Cuiting's floor exercise landed steadily, with strong legs. The Chinese team ultimately won the bronze medal with a 2.188-point lead, returning to the "long-absent" top three.

Experts believe that China's return to the top three shows that gymnastics remains a flagship sport for China. Soviet veteran Ivanova also praised China's current batch of athletes. The Chinese team still has a level of difference from the Soviet and Romanian teams, especially in stable landings. There were a total of 7 landing errors on the vault. While the Soviet and Romanian athletes landed as if their feet were nailed to the ground. The Chinese team's floor exercise also lacked the flavor and "flowers" of the others. It seems that in the future, to catch up with the Soviet Union and Romania, we still need to break through in these areas.

    中国女子体操从低谷走出
    本报记者　江建国
    中国女子体操队昨晚在苏罗中美四强参加的团体赛自选动作最后一组比赛中，以总成绩392.116分力克同一级别的美国队，赢得了1984年洛杉矶奥运会之后的第二块铜牌。在汉城奥运会仅获第6名以后一年左右的时间内，中国女子体操跨了三个台阶，表明中国女子体操已经走出低谷，开始复苏，水平正向苏联和罗马尼亚两强靠拢。
    昨晚的四强之争实际上是两个级别：苏联、罗马尼亚一级，中国、美国是稍低的下一级。中国队的比赛是从平衡木开始。这个抽签结果并不利，因为一旦平衡木发生掉下现象，对以后的三项比赛都有不利影响。中国女队先以老将樊迪打头阵。只见她如行云流水，动作舒展，后空翻720度飞下时，只稍动了一下，成功了！她获得了9.825分。在这一成功的鼓舞下，李嬿运用了西里夸尔高难度动作，杨波造型优美，如同杂技中的“叼花”，陈翠婷的“倒插虎”、马英的分腿跳、王文静的拉拉提都很成功，包含不少可以加分的独创因素。全队无一人失败，一开始就压住美国队2分多。行家们称赞这一炮打得好，世界锦标赛团体赛中个个成功是不多见的。此后，中国姑娘在其他项目中就比较放得开了。马英跳马动作有独创，有难度；陈翠婷的自由体操落地稳当，双腿有力。中国队最终以2.188分的优势获得铜牌，回到“阔别已久”的前三名行列。
    行家们认为，中国能重返前三名之列，说明体操仍是中国体育的拳头项目。苏联老将伊万诺娃昨天也称赞中国这一批运动员不错。中国队跟苏、罗两队还有一级的差距，特别在落地稳定方面。跳马落地总共7次失误。而苏、罗的大部分运动员如同脚下灌了铅，钉子似地钉在地上。中国队自由体操也不如人家韵味足，有“花”少“叶”。看来，今后追赶苏联和罗马尼亚队，还要在这些方面攻关。
