    The Heart of a Soldier's Wife

    Her name is Li Dingxia, a wife of a soldier. Her husband, Shi Wen-guang, is a veteran doctor in the Jiangsu Provincial Garrison Command of the People's Armed Police with nearly 40 years of service and multiple awards for merit. Last October, Shi Wen-guang passed away due to illness.

    Before her husband's cremation, Li Dingxia told the unit leaders who came to express their condolences: "Thank you to the Party for cultivating my husband and to the organization for caring for me. I have no personal requests. Please do not take care of me, and do not hold a memorial service for him."

    The hospital intended to buy a high-quality urn for her husband, but Li Dingxia, upon learning this, went to the hospital's political commissar and said: "My husband lived a frugal life, and his funeral should be simple as well. I think a ceramic urn will do; there is no need for an expensive one. Let's save some of the state's money." The political commissar had no choice but to respect her wishes. Li Dingxia said: "I am a soldier's wife and should bring honor to the military. I cannot take advantage of my husband's passing to ask the organization for favors. If I do, I would be letting down my husband in the afterlife. I would not be a qualified soldier's wife."

    一个军人妻子的情怀
    她叫李鼎霞，一位军人的妻子。她的丈夫石文光是武警部队江苏总队医院的一位多次立功受奖、有近40年军龄的老军医。去年10月，石文光因病去世。
    在丈夫的遗体火化前，李鼎霞对前去慰问的部队领导说：“感谢党培养了我的丈夫，感谢组织对我的关心。我没有什么个人要求，请组织不要照顾我，也不要给他开追悼会。”
    总队医院打算为她的丈夫买个精制的骨灰盒，李鼎霞知道后找到医院政委说：“我丈夫一生俭朴，办丧事也要俭朴。我看买个陶瓷骨灰盒就行了，不要买精制的，少花点国家的钱。”政委最后只好尊重她的意愿。李鼎霞说：“我是军人的妻子，应当为军人争光。我不能借丈夫病故向组织伸手，假如我向组织伸手，我就对不起九泉之下的丈夫。我就不是一个合格的军人妻子。”
