	The current supply situation of materials in China is generally good. Over the past year of rectification and adjustment, the production materials circulation sector has reversed the acute supply-demand contradictions that have occurred in recent years. The situation of reduced inventory, soaring prices, and disorder has improved. Especially in material supply, the state's industrial policies have been implemented, effectively ensuring the needs of key production and construction projects. This year, the state has ensured the supply of energy, transportation, important raw materials, and power generation equipment manufacturing under the directive production plan. For 203 key construction projects organized by the state according to reasonable construction periods, a supply system based on actual needs has been implemented. For agricultural and agricultural machinery materials as well as light industrial market materials, special arrangements have also been made. These measures have played a positive role in stabilizing the market and promoting the development of the national economy.

	In addition, domestic production resources have increased. From January to August, the production of coal, steel, ten non-ferrous metals, soda ash, caustic soda, cement, and other materials has reached or exceeded the level of the same period last year. The supply of these materials has been eased to varying degrees. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the production of major raw materials will be completed or exceeded as planned. The increase in the import of major raw materials and the initial control of exports are also conducive to further improving domestic supply and promoting the stability of the national economy.

	Since this year, due to the reduction of fixed asset investment scale, control of excessively high industrial growth rates, adjustment of some product structures, restriction of some unreasonable consumption, as well as the stagnation of sales and production decline of some high-end consumer goods and general machinery products such as refrigerators and washing machines, the consumption of major materials such as coal, steel, and timber in the whole society has relatively decreased. The situation of tight supply and reduced inventory of some major materials at the beginning of the year has changed, and the supply situation has improved, with inventory generally increasing, leading to a slowing down of the price increase trend of production materials, and some prices have even decreased. According to statistics from 50 material markets in various provinces, municipalities, and some key cities, the average price increase of 30 important materials in the market has been gradually slowing down since May this year, with a 14.5% increase in May compared to the beginning of the year, 11.9% in July, and 8.5% in August. Of the 30 materials, 19 had price increases in August compared to the beginning of the year, while 11 had price decreases. The market price of three-grade bituminous coal rose month by month from January to July, but began to decline in August, down 1.2% from July.

	Regarding the problems in material supply work, Liu Suinian believes there are mainly five issues.

	First, the implementation of state directive plan materials is poor, and the delivery situation is very bad, with strong feedback from users. Currently, some enterprises have a weak sense of executing the state plan, prioritizing their own interests over the overall situation, using various reasons to delay or not execute the directive plans issued by the state. The phenomenon of "orders not being followed and prohibitions not being heeded" is still serious and worsening. Steel is chronically under-delivered, and the under-delivery situation of other materials is also severe. The contract fulfillment rate for state orders is decreasing. From January to August, the contract fulfillment rate for steel was 6.2 percentage points lower than the same period last year. The contract fulfillment rate for coal was 1.5 percentage points lower. However, self-sales by enterprises have significantly increased.

	Second, the use of enterprise self-sale resources is not reasonable. Often, the enterprise sells to whoever offers the highest price, which encourages blind development.

	Third, the high-price portion of materials allocated by the state plan has significantly increased. For example, steel, the high-price portion accounts for 26.7% of the planned allocation. Non-ferrous metals, the high-price portion accounts for 48.5% of the planned allocation. Soda ash and caustic soda, the high-price portions account for 29.4% and 37.2% of the planned allocation, respectively. Some of these high-price materials are approved by the state, but some are priced arbitrarily by enterprises. Users generally find it difficult to bear these costs, which not only increase the cost of products but also drive up the prices of downstream products.

	Fourth, the material department lacks funds and has limited regulatory capacity. Currently, some chemical raw materials, automobiles, timber, and cold-rolled thin plates in steel are experiencing stagnation, but due to insufficient domestic production capacity, this stagnation is only temporary. To protect enterprise production, some products should be purchased by the material department when the price drops to a certain level. However, material enterprises generally face financial difficulties and are unable to purchase, thus unable to perform the function of absorption and adjustment.

	Fifth, the order of material circulation has not fundamentally improved. The prominent problem is that there are too many and too chaotic business entities, and the progress of cleaning and rectification is not ideal, with some policy boundaries still unclear.

	Regarding the economic situation next year, Liu Suinian predicts that in 1990, the economic structure will need to be further adjusted, and the dual-tight policy of finance and credit will continue to be implemented. The number of new construction projects will further decrease, and the stagnation of high-end consumer goods will continue for some time. The gap between total supply and total demand in society will gradually narrow, and the material supply and demand situation will further improve, with both tight and loose supply, and the overall quantity can be basically balanced.

	However, this minister believes that the situation where social total demand exceeds total supply will not fundamentally change in the short term. Therefore, the task of material supply and balance next year will still be quite arduous. To complete the task of national economic development, strong measures are needed to ensure it. Liu Suinian proposes to strengthen the seriousness and discipline of the state directive material allocation plan; the state should appropriately concentrate on important materials to enhance macro-allocation capabilities and ensure key needs; limit unreasonable consumption, and emphasize the need to continue to clean up and rectify important material business entities, especially to rectify business entities operated by government agencies, groups, collectives, and individuals. Decisive measures should be taken to eliminate business entities that do not undertake supply tasks and are solely engaged in illegal resale for profiteering, and to expand direct contact between production and demand.

　　物资部长柳随年谈当前供应形势
　　治理整顿一年取得效果
　　物资供求尖锐矛盾缓和
　　求大供小局面未根本改变明年平衡任务艰巨
    新华社北京10月23日电　（记者徐克洪）我国当前物资供应形势如何？记者日前就此走访了物资部部长柳随年。
    柳随年认为，首先应看到当前物资供应形势总的看是好的。治理整顿一年来，生产资料流通领域扭转了近几年来供求矛盾尖锐的局面，库存减少、价格暴涨、秩序混乱的状况有了改变。特别是在物资供应上注意贯彻国家产业政策，较好地保证了重点生产建设的需要。今年国家在物资分配上，保证了能源、交通运输、重要原材料和发电设备制造的指令性生产计划任务的需要，对国家按合理工期组织施工的203个重点建设项目实行了按需核实供应，对农业和农机用料以及轻工市场用料也都做了重点安排。这些都对稳定市场，促进国民经济的发展，起了积极的作用。
    此外，国内生产资源增加。1—8月，煤炭、钢材、十种有色金属、纯碱、烧碱、水泥等的产量都达到去年同期水平或有所增长。这些物资的供应紧张状况在不同程度上得到了缓和。预计到年末主要原材料生产能按计划完成或超额完成。主要原材料进口增加，出口初步得到控制，也有利于进一步改善国内供应、促进国民经济的稳定。
    今年以来，由于压缩固定资产投资规模，控制过高的工业增长速度，调整部分产品结构，限制一些不合理的消费，以及电冰箱、洗衣机等一些高档消费品和一般机械产品出现滞销、生产下降，全社会煤炭和钢材、木材等主要原材料的消费量相对减少。今年初一些主要物资供应紧张，库存下降的情况已发生了变化，供应情况有所好转，库存普遍上升，致使生产资料价格涨势趋缓，有的有所下降。据各省区市、计划单列市及部分重点城市50个物资市场的统计，今年5月份以来，30种重要物资市场平均价格的涨势逐月减缓，5月比年初上涨14.5％，7月上涨11.9％，8月上涨8.5％。30种物资中，8月份市场价格比年初上涨的有19种，下降的有11种，三级烟煤1—7月市场价格逐月上升，8月份也开始回落，比7月份下降1.2％。
    至于物资供应工作中存在的问题，柳随年认为主要有5个。
    第一，国家指令性计划物资资源落实不好，交货情况也很差，用户反映强烈。现在有些企业执行国家计划的观念很淡薄，为了自身的利益，不顾大局，以各种理由为借口，拖延或不执行国家下达的指令性计划。有令不行、有禁不止的现象仍然严重存在，而且愈演愈烈。钢材是连年欠交，其它物资比计划欠交的状况也很严重。国家订货合同兑现率越来越低。1—8月，钢材合同兑现率比去年同期下降6.2个百分点。煤炭合同兑现率下降1.5个百分点。而企业自销却大量增加。
    第二，企业自销资源的使用不够合理。往往是谁出的价高，企业就卖给谁，助长了盲目发展。
    第三，国家计划分配的物资中高价部分大幅度增加。如钢材，高价部分已占到计划分配量的26.7％。有色金属高价部分占计划分配量的48.5％。纯碱、烧碱高价部分分别占计划分配量的29.4％和37.2％。这些高价物资，有的是经过国家批准的，但也有些是企业擅自涨价的。对此，用户普遍反映难以承受，既加大了产品的成本，又拉动了下游产品的价格。
    第四，物资部门资金短缺，缺乏调控能力。当前部分化工原料、汽车、木材以及钢材中的冷轧薄板出现滞销，但由于国内生产能力不足，滞销只是暂时现象。为了保护企业的生产，有些产品待价格降到一定时候，物资部门应适时加以收购。可物资企业普遍资金紧张，无力收购，以致发挥不了吞吐调剂的功能。
    第五，物资流通秩序还没有根本好转。突出的问题是经营单位过多过滥，清理整顿进展不够理想，有些政策界限还不够清楚。
    对于明年的经济形势，柳随年预测说，由于1990年里经济结构要进一步调整，财政、信贷双紧政策要继续贯彻执行，基本建设新开工项目会进一步减少，高档消费品滞销还要延续一段时间，社会总供给与总需求的差距将逐步缩小，物资供需形势也将进一步好转，供需上将有紧有松，在总量上可以基本平衡。
    不过，这位部长认为，我国社会总需求大于总供给的局面不可能在短时间内根本改变，因此，明年的物资供应和平衡任务仍相当艰巨。要完成国民经济发展的供给重任，还需要有力措施来保证。柳随年就此提出加强国家指令性物资调拨计划的严肃性和纪律性；国家对重要物资要适当集中，增强宏观调拨能力，保证重点需要；限制不合理消费等项措施。并强调应继续清理整顿重要物资经营单位，特别要整顿机关团体办的和集体、个体的经营单位，采取坚决措施砍掉不承担供应任务、专门从事非法倒卖牟取暴利的经营单位，扩大产需之间的直接见面。
