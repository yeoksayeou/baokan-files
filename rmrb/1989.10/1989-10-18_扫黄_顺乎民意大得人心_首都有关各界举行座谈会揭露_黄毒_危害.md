**The Campaign Against Pornography Aligns with Public Sentiment and Gains Popular Support**

**A Symposium Held in the Capital by Various Sectors Exposes the Harm of Pornography**

**Editor's Note:** On October 13th, the National Working Group for the Rectification and Cleanup of the Book, Newspaper, and Audio-Visual Market convened a symposium in the capital with representatives from the education, publishing, public security, and women's federations. The symposium exposed the harm of obscene books and audio-visual materials to minors. Below are excerpts from the speeches. See these shocking facts for yourself! Hear these righteous accusations! Every Communist Party member and citizen of the republic has a responsibility to clean up these spiritual garbage and protect the healthy growth of our next generation.

**Positive Education Often Neutralized by a Single Bad Book**

Wang Changzhi (Deputy Principal of Beijing Huifen Middle School):

Youths are in a period of rapid intellectual and physical development, with a malleable but weak self-control. They have strong imitative but weak discriminatory abilities. Therefore, the impact of obscene books and audio-visual materials on minors is extremely serious. In recent years, students influenced by violent, murderous, and obscene books and audio-visual materials have shown the following behaviors:

First, they become spiritually dazed and listless. Many children who have been exposed to obscene books and audio-visual materials have changed from their originally cheerful and energetic demeanor to a state of confusion and lack of ambition, as if they have lost their souls.

Second, they lose interest in studying and neglect their education. A male student was so engrossed in reading "The Girl's Heart" in class that he didn't notice the teacher standing beside him, let alone listen to the teacher's lecture. Some students, who had entered key schools with high scores, saw their academic performance plummet after reading bad books, even repeating a grade or dropping out of school.

Third, their morals decline and discipline disintegrates. A female student watched a film depicting the life of a prostitute and developed a bizarre idea, believing that prostitutes could enjoy the love of many men. She dressed up and went out to find a boyfriend, but was chased by hoodlums to her home, nearly getting into trouble. A male student bought a yellowed, worn-out small newspaper for one yuan from a bookstall and passed it around among his classmates. During fights, they made obscene gestures, polluting the class collective spiritually.

Fourth, they form gangs and engage in fights. Some students, influenced by violent and murderous literature, have a strong feudal gang mentality, using "power politics" in interpersonal relationships, relying on fists to speak, without a sense of right and wrong or legal awareness.

Fifth, they break the law and commit crimes. Some students, after reading obscene and pornographic books, want to imitate and try it out. A male student was detained for molesting a young girl.

Minors who have been harmed by bad books find it difficult to recover. Some teachers lament, "Our positive education for students is often nullified by a single bad book." Teachers and parents are anxious, and for many years, they have called for a solution to this problem. Now, the Party Central Committee has decided to carry out the campaign against pornography to the end, aligning with public sentiment and gaining popular support. We firmly support this. Caring for minors is caring for the future of the country. We not only need to investigate obscene books in schools but also conduct positive education to improve minors' political and ideological qualities, moral standards, and aesthetic abilities, and continuously enrich minors' extracurricular activities.

Dong Bolin (Deputy Director of the Political and Educational Affairs Office, Beijing Municipal Education Bureau):

There are some "out-of-sight students"—students who perform well in school and are considered unlikely to go astray—who have also been influenced by bad books. A Young Pioneer and a three-time outstanding student in Beijing was ruined by a bad book and a pornographic videotape! The proliferation of bad books and pornographic publications in society seriously interferes with the school's political, ideological, and worldview education. Schools teach students to pursue ideals, but bad books teach them to pursue fists and pillows. No wonder parents say, "Teachers educate people, but bad books corrupt them."

Therefore, we should promote spiritual products that educate people and prohibit the proliferation of things that corrupt people. Since 1979, the education system in Beijing has organized three cleanups of bad books in primary and secondary schools, but due to the lack of cooperation from various sectors of society, it has been difficult to eradicate the problem. The entire society should pay attention to the campaign against pornography. We have collaborated with 20 publishers to prepare the publication of "Children's Library," "Youth Library," and "Young Adults Library," providing healthy and beneficial spiritual nourishment for minors of different age groups. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League organized middle school students to participate in the "I Write My Own Song" activity, selecting 10 songs written by middle school students. The "I Read a Book My Parents Love" activity was also successful, with good books like "Red Rock" and "How the Steel Was Tempered" returning to the hands of children.

We hope that the Party Central Committee and the State Council will take concrete measures to encourage literary and artistic workers to write more good books and compose good songs for children.

**Obscene Books Destroy the Next Generation—Shocking Facts**

Tan Pu (Deputy Principal of Beijing Chaoyang District Vocational School):

Vocational schools are responsible for the arduous task of educating and rescuing minors with illegal and minor criminal behaviors. In recent years, the work of rescue has become increasingly difficult, and the rate of improvement among delinquent minors has been declining. Among the important reasons are the bad social atmosphere and the repeated bans on obscene, pornographic, violent, murderous, and feudal superstitious books. Minors harmed by bad books and walking towards crime are increasing, making educators feel helpless and confused.

Statistics show that 60% of vocational students have varying degrees of sexual offenses, with females being particularly severe, accounting for 75%. Seeing the confessions of students harmed by obscene books and videotapes, and listening to their blood-curdling accusations after receiving education and repenting, we are extremely indignant towards the units and individuals who publish, distribute, and sell obscene books and videotapes.

I will give some shocking examples that have happened to vocational students. A 17-year-old boy, Xiao Li, was once a member of the school's Youth League Committee and the chairman of the student union. He excelled in his studies in elementary and middle school and was awarded the title of outstanding student at the municipal and district levels multiple times. However, after reading handwritten copies of "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" and "The Girl's Heart," he was completely captivated by the obscene scenes in the books, reading them over and over again, falling into sexual fantasies, and the thought of "trying it out" becoming stronger. From then on, Xiao Li changed completely. In just over a year, he molested and insulted eight female students. A child with good qualities fell into ruin.

A 15-year-old female student, Xiao Wang, excelled in both academics and sports in elementary school and loved sports. She once broke a municipal record. She was selected by the municipal sports school and trained hard. At the municipal games, Xiao Wang won the women's 100-meter and 200-meter championships and then won the first place in the youth women's all-around event at the national division track and field meet. She yearned for the five-star red flag to rise before her, but she also encountered those spiritual opiums. As a result, Xiao Wang became bored with training, didn't want to study, and eventually skipped school, going out to mix with bad people, pursuing a life of pleasure and debauchery, not caring about the school's education and punishments, and not even caring about being detained. The municipal sports school had no choice but to expel her. She became a student at the vocational school.

Only by mobilizing the strength of the entire society to completely eliminate those spiritual opiums can we, educators on the front line, have the confidence and ability to rescue those delinquent minors.

Zhou Dejun (Director of the Beijing Juvenile Detention Center):

How obscene and pornographic books and audio-visual materials harm minors, we, the labor reform and reeducation workers, have a deep understanding. In Beijing, among minors under 18, the situation of committing hooliganism, prostitution, rape, and gang rape is shocking. In 1982, among the detained and juvenile delinquents, those who committed sexual crimes accounted for 10%, and after 1987, this proportion rose to 41.2%, an increase of 31.2% in five years. The age of sexual crimes is decreasing, with the average age in 1982 being 15.5 years, and after 1987, the average age is only 14.8 years, with the youngest being 12 years old. More seriously, the mindset and ideas of juvenile delinquents regarding sexual crimes have changed greatly. In the past, after committing sexual crimes, they would not dare to lift their heads, feeling ashamed; now, they have no sense of guilt, not only do they not feel ashamed, but they even take pride in it, thinking that those who have more opposite-sex friends and more sexual crimes are "heroes" with abilities, otherwise, they are cowards.

These teenagers are in a period of sexual awakening, very sensitive to sex, and after being exposed to pornographic videos, they are infatuated, unable to extricate themselves, and walk towards crime. The speed at which obscene items harm minors is astonishing. A 15-year-old boy saw a pornographic book at a friend's house, repeatedly reading the descriptions of sexual relationships between cousins, and then molested his 3.5-year-old sister at home. Some girls developed into group sex and prostitution. Two 16-year-old female detainees once found a man in his 40s to have sex together and even demanded "youth subsidy fees."

It should also be pointed out that books and audio-visual materials that promote violence and murder also harm minors greatly. In 1982, among the detained and juvenile delinquents, those who committed armed robbery and assault accounted for only 2% of the total number of criminals, and after 1987, this increased to 16.4%. Some minors imitate chivalrous and brotherly friendship, believing in the "at home rely on parents, outside rely on friends" and "cowards are not gentlemen, without poison are not men" set, always wanting to use the power of the group to rule a place.

A minor saw his classmate fighting on the floor above his home, grabbed an iron shovel, and rushed down, not asking who was right or wrong, and joined the fight. When asked why he didn't mediate, he said, "I can't let my brother be bullied, I have to help my brother!" Three minors around 15 years old once formed a brotherhood, swearing to share happiness and misfortune together. One child suggested that they should work together to rule a place. As a result, they committed 10 robberies in a week, with many assault incidents, and were punished by law.

Most of these minors who have gone astray realize that they are victims of obscene and violent books and audio-visual materials. A 14-year-old minor said painfully, "I regret not listening to my teachers and parents, and I hate the adults who write bad books. Are they uncles and aunts? Are they writers? They are harming people! I beg the government to think of a way to save many children like me, and don't let them walk my path."

Jiang Rongsheng (Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau's Law Enforcement and Prohibition Office, Beijing):

Cases of copying and selling obscene videos are increasing year by year, with 91 cases seized in 1987 and 129 cases in 1988, an increase of 42%. Since 1985, 4,049 people have been seized for copying, selling, and spreading obscene materials, with a large proportion of minors, 2,400 minors under 25 years old, accounting for 59%. Especially, cases of middle school students watching obscene videos are increasing year by year, with 29 cases in 1987 and a sharp increase to 92 cases in 1988, an increase of 2.1 times. The speed and depth of minors being poisoned by obscene videos are unimaginable. I will give a few examples to illustrate this.

In July, a young woman who sold herself to foreigners was caught in the Ta Yuan Diplomatic Residence. This girl was once a very strong-willed young person who exposed her father's crimes. After her father was punished by law, the family's income decreased, and she had to live with friends. In difficult circumstances, she insisted on going to school, with excellent grades, and after graduation, she worked in a high-end restaurant, performing well. Once, she borrowed a pornographic videotape from a colleague, became deeply poisoned, and thought that the sex life of foreigners in the video was more enjoyable than imitating it with her boyfriend. She wanted to try it out with a foreigner. Finally, she actively flirted with foreigners at work, disregarding national dignity and personal dignity, and sold herself to foreigners.

A model worker and Communist Party member from a certain factory of the Aerospace Department watched a pornographic video in a dormitory borrowed by a colleague, becoming addicted like smoking opium, wanting to watch more and more. He said, "If I don't watch pornographic videos for a day, it feels like something is missing, and even eating doesn't taste good." He also collaborated with a few young workers from the same factory to drive around searching for pornographic videos, and was finally caught for copying and spreading pornographic videos and sent to reeducation through labor.

**While Cleaning Up Pornography, Provide Healthy Reading Materials**

Zhen Yan (Deputy Director of the Women's Federation and Director of the Children's Department, Beijing):

In recent years, pornographic materials have changed from handwritten to printed, and from underground to public, with shocking harm.

According to a survey, the physiological maturity of minors is advancing. The average age of menarche for girls in Beijing is 13.09 years, and the average age of spermatorrhea for boys is 14.37 years, both earlier than the national average. Relatively speaking, children's psychological preparation for the arrival of puberty is insufficient, making it easy for them to be invaded by spiritual poisons.

Minors who have read bad books can be roughly divided into three categories, which can be summarized as "small at both ends, large in the middle." One category is class cadres and excellent students. After reading pornographic books, they will be dazed for a few days, but they still have some self-control; moreover, they have heavy study tasks and many social activities, quickly forgetting what they have read. One category is average students, which is the majority. After reading bad books, they often cannot help but reminisce, making it difficult to extricate themselves, leading to a decline in academic performance; if there is external temptation, it is easy to go astray. There is another category of poor students who have no interest in studying and do not strive for progress. They not only read pornographic books themselves but also spread them to their classmates, even tempting others, leading to criminal activities.

From our questionnaire survey of middle school students, pornographic books have corrupted the academic atmosphere and caused children to be eager to have opposite-sex friends at an early age. After 1983, the age of opposite-sex friendships has been decreasing, and the proportion has been increasing, even involving some female students in the higher grades of primary school.

Now, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have finally decided to take action against the spiritual poisons that corrupt minors, hoping to thoroughly clean up and not be lenient.

Minors have a strong desire for knowledge, so while banning bad books, we should also provide them with rich spiritual nourishment. During the summer vacation, the television station broadcasted 20 excellent domestic and foreign films, and we organized a film review essay contest. Unexpectedly, the children's strongest response was to "Leifeng." Among the more than 1,000 essays, more than 200 were about the afterthoughts of watching "Leifeng." A student from Beijing No. 4 Middle School sincerely wrote in a film review, "In the future, I will always think about being a person who benefits the people." Among the films loved by students, the top ones, in addition to "Leifeng," include "How the Steel Was Tempered," "Heroic Sons and Daughters," "Battle on Shangganling Mountain," and "Dan Nang." A student wrote after watching "Dan Nang," "I understand, sacrificing for the country and the people is happiness."

**Be Vigilant Against the Return of Illegal Bookstalls**

Gao Shulin (Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Press and Publication Bureau):

Bad books are not only manuals for inciting crimes but also tarnish the reputation of publishers. People used to trust state-owned publishers, but these publishers have also published bad books in recent years, inviting criticism.

Some people say that publishers are "yellow sources," using soft knives to kill people, killing people without blood, taking money without caring about the next generation. Some yellow books, once published, are printed in tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of copies, exacerbating the shortage of paper supply. Publishing bad books also ruined a group of publishing house cadres, who, for money, ignored the Party's policies and laws, and went to prison for publishing bad books. The proliferation of bad books also resulted in a large amount of tax evasion, enriching individuals and harming the state.

The work of rectifying and cleaning up the book, newspaper, and audio-visual markets in Beijing began in mid-July. By October 7th, the city had seized and banned 560,000 copies of books and newspapers, sealed and stored 260,000 copies of books and newspapers, seized 500 cassettes of obscene audio tapes and 1,529 obscene video tapes, and uncovered three gangs involved in the illegal editing, publishing, printing, and distribution of obscene and pornographic books and newspapers, six groups involved in the dissemination and screening of obscene videos, one factory involved in the illegal copying and processing of yellow audio-visual tapes, and revoked the business licenses of 23 individual bookstalls.

The book and audio-visual markets have initially improved, but there are still many problems and hidden dangers. In the previous stage, under the deterrent effect of the campaign against pornography, some bookstalls did not set up stalls or temporarily hid the banned books and newspapers, preparing to come out again after the wind subsided. Some people also turned public activities into underground transactions. Therefore, we must establish the idea of long-term warfare and fight a protracted battle.

Many people are worried that the campaign against pornography will be a one-time effort and will end after a while, just for show. Some bookstalls also have experience, as in the past, they were always cleaned up before festivals and major events, and they would hide for a while and come back after the event. This time, we must change the past practice and continue, gaining the trust of the people. Now, the "campaign against pornography" offices in various districts and counties cannot be disbanded, and personnel cannot be reduced or relaxed. We must thoroughly clean up bad books and videos and cannot give up halfway.

**The Campaign Against Pornography Requires the Joint Efforts of the Entire Society**

Liu Zhongde (Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, Head of the National Working Group for the Rectification and Cleanup of the Book, Newspaper, and Audio-Visual Market):

The facts mentioned by the comrades are far from the full extent of the harm, but they have already made us feel shocked. From this, it is not difficult to understand why the Party Central Committee and the State Council attach so much importance to the campaign against pornography, why the entire society is so concerned, and why every parent is so worried that their children will be harmed by spiritual poisons. From the speeches, we can hear the entire society calling for action, and we must not let this harm continue.

The Party Central Committee and the State Council recently decided to launch a nationwide campaign to rectify and clean up the book, newspaper, and audio-visual markets. This is a specific measure to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, an important step in the construction of spiritual civilization, and it is related to whether we can protect the healthy growth of minors and whether we can cultivate them into qualified successors of socialist construction.

In the past month, the campaign against pornography has shown initial results. The country has seized more than 50 million copies of obscene, yellow, violent, murderous, and feudal superstitious books and newspapers, as well as 400,000 obscene video tapes; investigated 300 gangs involved in the production and distribution of pornography and more than 1,800 related criminal suspects, and given the most severe legal punishment to those who are extremely evil.

But it should also be seen that to achieve greater social benefits, more arduous efforts are needed. Because this is the common work of the entire society, it is not effective to rely on a single department or unit.

Therefore, we hope for the support of the entire society to carry out the campaign against pornography to the end. Especially, we need to combine the concentrated rectification and cleanup within a certain period with the long-term governance work, that is, to incorporate it into the legal system and establish relevant long-term institutions.

It is not enough to just clean up cultural poisons and garbage; more importantly, we need to provide more healthy and beneficial literary and artistic works for the masses and the vast number of minors, and occupy the spiritual civilization field with healthy and beneficial cultural activities. We hope that the broad cultural and artistic workers will create more healthy cultural food.

    “扫黄”顺乎民意大得人心
    ——首都有关各界举行座谈会揭露“黄毒”危害
    编者按：10月13日，全国整顿清理书报刊和音像市场工作小组召集首都教育、出版、公安、妇联等有关各界人士的座谈会，揭露淫秽书刊和音像对青少年的危害。这里刊登的是发言摘要。看看这些触目惊心的事实吧！听听这些义正辞严的控诉吧！每一个共产党员和共和国的公民都有责任来清扫这些精神垃圾，保护我们的下一代健康成长。
    正面教育常常被一本坏书抵消了
    王常祉（北京市汇文中学副校长）：
    青少年处在长知识、长身体、世界观尚未形成的时期，可塑性强，但自制力差；模仿力强，但分辨力差，因此，黄色书刊、音像对青少年的影响极为严重。这些年，那些受到凶杀暴力、淫秽书刊和音像影响的学生，所表现出的状态是：
    第一，精神恍惚，萎靡不振。许多接触了黄色书刊、音像的孩子一改原来天真烂漫、蓬勃向上的精神面貌，变成昏昏沉沉、不求进取的心态，像丢了魂一样。
    第二，无心读书、学业荒废。一名男学生在课堂上读《少女的心》，如痴如醉，连老师走到自己身边都没有发觉，更谈不上听老师讲课了。有的学生以高分考入重点学校，读了坏书后学习成绩急剧下降，甚至留级、辍学。
    第三，道德滑坡，纪律涣散。一名女生看了描写妓女生活的影视片，产生荒诞的想法，认为妓女能享受多人的爱，于是打扮上街找男朋友，结果被小流氓追逐到家里来，险些出问题。一名男生在书摊上花一元钱买到一张已经变黄、破旧的小报，在同学中互相传看，男生之间打斗时做下流动作，使班集体受到精神污染。
    第四，入伙结帮，打架斗殴。有些学生受暴力、凶杀读物影响，封建帮会意识严重，人际关系采取“实力政策”，靠拳头说话，没有是非、法律观念。
    第五，以身试法，走向犯罪。有的学生看了色情淫秽书刊后，就想模仿试一试。有个男生就因猥亵幼女而被拘留。
    青少年受坏书毒害后，很难自拔。有的教师感慨：“我们对学生进行的正面教育，常常被一本坏书给抵消了。”广大教师和家长心急如焚，多年来呼吁解决这个问题。现在党中央下决心把“扫黄”斗争进行到底，顺乎民意，大得人心，我们坚决拥护。关心青少年就是关心祖国的未来呵。我们不仅要清查校园内的黄书，更要进行正面教育，提高青少年的政治思想、品德素质和审美能力，不断丰富青少年的课余生活。
    董柏林（北京市教育局政教处副处长）：
    有一些“视线外学生”——即在校表现较好，被认为不会学坏的孩子——也受了坏书的影响。有个共青团员，还是北京市连续三年的三好学生，就毁在一本坏书、一盘黄色录像带之中了！社会上坏书和黄色出版物的泛滥严重干扰了学校的政治教育、思想教育和人生观教育。学校教育学生要追求理想，坏书却教他们追求拳头、枕头。难怪家长要说“教师育人、坏书毁人”了。
    所以我们要提倡育人的精神产品，禁止毁人的东西泛滥。1979年以来，北京市的教育系统组织中小学清查过三次坏书，但由于缺少社会各界的配合，孤掌难鸣，未能斩草除根。应当全社会都来重视“扫黄”工作。我们与20家出版社协作筹备出版《儿童文库》、《少年文库》和《青年文库》，向不同年龄层次的青少年提供健康有益的精神食粮。共青团北京市委组织中学生开展“我写我的歌”活动，评选出10首中学生自己的歌曲。“我读父辈喜爱的一本书”活动也很成功，《红岩》、《钢铁是怎样炼成的》等好书重新回到孩子们手中。
    我们希望党中央、国务院能采取具体措施，鼓励文学艺术工作者多为孩子们写好书、谱好歌。
    淫秽书刊毁我下一代触目惊心
    谭朴（北京市朝阳区工读学校副校长）：
    工读学校担负着教育、挽救有违法和轻微犯罪行为的青少年的艰巨任务。近年来挽救工作越来越难做，失足青少年的改好率日趋下降，其中不良社会风气与黄色淫秽、暴力凶杀、封建迷信书刊的屡禁不止是重要原因。受黄书毒害而走向犯罪的青少年越来越多，使我们教育工作者倍感头痛，十分困惑。
    据统计，60％的工读生不同程度存在性罪错，女生尤其严重，有性罪错的占75％。看着孩子们一份份受淫秽书刊、录像带毒害的交待材料，听着孩子们受过教育幡然悔悟后对坏书血和泪的控诉，我们对那些出版、发行、销售黄色书刊与录像带的单位和个人无比愤慨。
    我举一些发生在工读生身上的触目惊心的事例。17岁的男孩子小李，曾经是学校团委委员、学生会主席。他小学、初中时成绩优异，多次被评为市、区级三好学生。然而读了手抄本《曼娜回忆录》、《少女之心》等坏书之后，他完全被书中的淫乱情节迷住，读了一遍又一遍，陷入性幻觉之中，“试一试”的念头日趋强烈。自此，小李完全变了。一年多的时间里，被他猥亵、污辱的女生竟达8名之多。一个本来素质很好的孩子就这样堕落了。
    15岁的女学生小王，小学时品学兼优，酷爱体育，曾经打破过市级纪录。她希望像女排大姐姐那样，长大后走向世界体坛，为国争光。她果然被市体校选中，在训练中她十分刻苦。市运会上，小王一举夺得女子100米、200米两项冠军，接着，又获全国分区田径赛少年组女子全能第一名。她多么向往五星红旗能在自己面前冉冉升起，可是，她也接触到了那些精神鸦片。结果，小王变得厌倦训练，不想读书，后来干脆逃学，出去与坏人鬼混，追求享乐、放荡的生活，对学校的教育和处分根本不放在心上，连受到拘留也满不在乎，市体校不得不把她开除。她成了工读学校的学生。
    只有动员全社会的力量，彻底清除那些精神鸦片，我们这些工作在第一线的教育工作者才有信心、有可能挽救那些失足青少年。
    周德钧（北京市少年犯管教所所长）：
    淫秽色情书刊音像是如何毒害青少年的，我们劳改劳教工作人员的感受十分深刻。北京市18岁以下的未成年人中，犯有流氓、卖淫、强奸、轮奸等性犯罪的情况触目惊心。1982年，少管人员和少年犯中，属于性犯罪的占10％，1987年以后这个比例达到41.2％，5年中上升31.2％。性犯罪年龄下降，1982年以前平均年龄为15.5岁，1987年以后平均年龄只有14.8岁，年龄最小的仅12岁。更为严重的是，少年犯中性犯罪的心态和观念发生了很大变化。过去，性犯罪后，抬不起头来，觉得是见不得人的事；现在，根本没有犯罪感，不但不认为可耻，反而引以为荣，觉得交异性朋友多、性犯罪多的是“英雄”、有本事，反之是狗熊。
    这些十几岁的青少年处于性萌动时期，对性十分敏感，接触淫秽录像后神魂颠倒，有的不能自拔，走向犯罪。淫秽物品对青少年的影响、毒害之快，到了立竿见影的地步。一个15岁的少年在朋友家见到一本黄书，反复阅读书中表兄表妹性关系的描写，回家后就把3岁半的小妹妹奸污了。有些女孩子发展到群奸群宿和卖淫。有两个16岁的女少管人员，曾共同找了一个40多岁的男人同床奸宿，还索要什么“青春补助费”。
    还要指出的是，宣扬凶杀暴力的书刊、影像对青少年的毒害也很大。1982年，少管人员和少年犯中，持械抢劫和伤害的仅占犯罪总人数的2％，1987年以后增加到16.4％。一些青少年模仿江湖义气、哥们义气，信奉“在家靠父母、出门靠朋友”和“胆小非君子、无毒不丈夫”一套，总想借群体的力量称霸一方。
    一个少年在楼上家中看到同学与人打架，操了一把铁锹冲下来，不问青红皂白就加入。问他为什么不劝架，他说：“不能让哥们吃亏，要助哥们一臂之力！”还有3个15岁左右的少年犯，曾经结为兄弟，发誓有福同享、有难同当，其中一个孩子建议合力称霸一方。结果，他们在一周内抢劫10次，其中伤害事故不少，受到法律制裁。
    这些走上邪路的青少年绝大多数意识到，自己是淫秽暴力书刊音像的受害者。一名14岁的少年沉痛地说：“我恨当初没听老师、家长的话，更恨写坏书的大人，他们是叔叔、阿姨吗？他们是文学家吗？他们在害人！请求政府想想办法救救许许多多和我一样的孩子，别再走我的路。”
    姜荣生（北京市公安局治安处查禁科科长）：
    复制、贩卖淫秽录像案件逐年增多，1987年全市查获91起，1988年增加到129起，上升了42％。1985年以来查获的复制、贩卖、传播淫秽物品的4049人中，青少年占的比重较大，25岁以下的青少年达2400人，占59％。特别是中学生观看淫秽录像的案件逐年增多，1987年29人，1988年猛增为92人，上升2.1倍。青少年看了淫秽录像以后，中毒之快、中毒之深是难以想像的。我仅举几个例子就可以说明。
    7月，在塔园外交公寓抓获一名向外国人卖淫的女青年。这个女孩子本是很要强的青年，曾揭发父亲的罪行。其父受法律制裁后，家里经济收入减少，她只得寄居在朋友家。在困难的情况下，她仍然坚持上学，成绩优良，毕业后在一家档次很高的饭店当服务员，表现也不错。有一次，她从同事手中借来一盘淫秽录像带，中毒很深，和男友模仿还觉得不如录像中外国人的性生活够滋味，总想找一个外国人试一试。最后，她在工作中主动向外国人挑逗，不顾国格、人格，向外国人卖淫。
    航天部某厂有一名劳动模范、共产党员，在集体宿舍看了本厂职工借来的一盘黄色录像，像吸食鸦片一样上了瘾，看了一遍还想看，越看越想看。他说：“一天要是不看黄色录像，就像缺点什么，连吃饭都觉着不香。”他还伙同本厂几个青年职工开着汽车到处搜罗淫秽录像，最后终于因复制、传播淫秽录像被查获，送去劳动教养。
    “扫黄”的同时更要提供健康读物
    甄砚（北京市妇联常委、儿童部部长）：
    这些年来，黄色的东西从手抄变成铅字，从地下转为公开，其为害程度令人发指。
    据调查，目前青少年的生理成熟期提前了。北京市女孩子初潮的平均年龄是13.09岁，男孩子遗精的平均年龄是14.37岁，均比全国的同类指标提前。相对来说，孩子们对青春期来临的心理准备却很不足，因而容易被精神毒品乘虚而入。
    凡看过坏书的青少年，基本可分成三类，可以概括为“两头小，中间大”。一类是班干部、优等生，他们读了黄书后，会有几天的精神恍惚，但毕竟还有一定的自制能力；而且他们学习任务重、社会活动多，很快会忘掉读过的东西。一类是中等生，这部分学生是大量的，他们读了坏书，往往情不自禁，反复回味，难以自拔，导致学习成绩下降；万一再有外界引诱，很容易变坏。还有一类是差生，本来就对学习没有兴趣，不思进取，他们不光自己读黄书，还传播给自己的同学，甚至引诱别人，导致犯罪活动。
    从我们对中学生进行的问卷调查来看，黄色书刊败坏了学风，诱发孩子们很早就热衷于交异性朋友。1983年以后，异性交友的年龄层次越来越低，比例越来越高，甚至一些小学高年级女生也卷进去了。
    现在，党中央、国务院终于下决心向腐蚀青少年心灵的精神毒品开刀了，希望一定要一抓到底，不能手软。
    青少年求知欲强烈，因而在查禁坏书的同时，也要向他们提供丰富的精神营养。暑假期间，电视台播放了20部优秀中外影片，我们组织了影评征文活动。有点出乎意料的是，孩子们反响最强烈的是《雷锋》，1000多篇征文当中有200多篇是写《雷锋》的观后感。北京四中的一个学生在影评中诚恳地写道：“今后，我要时刻想着做一个对人民有益的人。”在同学们喜爱的影片中，名列前茅的除《雷锋》外，还有《保尔·柯察金》、《英雄儿女》、《上甘岭》、《丹娘》等。一个同学看了《丹娘》后写道：“我懂了，为祖国和人民英勇献身就是幸福。”
    警惕不法书摊卷土重来
    高树林（北京市新闻出版局副局长）：
    坏书不仅是教唆犯罪的教科书，也败坏了出版社的名声。人们原来信赖国营的出版社，但这些出版社近几年也出坏书，招致责难。
    有人说出版社是“黄源”，软刀子杀人，杀人不见血，要钱不要后代。有的黄书一种便印刷十几万册，甚至几十万册，加剧了纸张供应紧张。滥出坏书还毁了一批出版社的干部，为了钱无视党的政策和法律，出坏书进了监狱。坏书泛滥，大量偷税漏税，肥了个人，坑了国家。
    北京市整顿清理书报刊及音像市场的工作是从7月中旬开始的。到10月7日，全市共收缴查禁书刊56万册，停售封存书刊26万册，收缴淫秽录音带500盒、录像带1529盘，查获非法编辑、出版、印刷、发行淫秽色情书刊的团伙3个，破获传播、放映淫秽录像的团体6个，查封非法复制加工黄色音像带的工厂一个，吊销个体书摊营业执照23人。
    书刊音像市场初步改观，但是还存在不少问题，还有隐患。前一阶段，在“扫黄”的威慑下，一些书摊不出摊了，或者把查禁的书刊暂时藏匿起来，准备风声过后再出来。也有少数人把公开活动转为地下交易。因此，我们要树立长期作战的思想，打持久战。
    很多人担心“扫黄”一阵风，扫一阵就完了，走过场。一些书摊也有经验，过去都是节前、重大活动前扫一阵，他们躲一下，过后卷土重来。这一次就是要改变过去的做法，一直搞下去，取信于民。我们现在各区、县的“扫黄”办公室的机构不能撤，人员一个也不能走，不能松劲。要把坏书坏影视扫除干净，决不能半途而废。
    “扫黄”需要全社会的共同努力
    刘忠德（国务院副秘书长、全国整顿清理书报刊和音像市场工作小组组长）：
    同志们谈到的事实还远不是危害的全部，但已经使我们感到触目惊心。由此不难理解为什么党中央、国务院如此重视
  “扫黄”工作，为什么全社会如此关注，为什么每一位父母如此担心孩子会受到精神毒品的危害。从发言中可以听到全社会都在发出呼吁，决不能让这种危害再继续下去了。
    党中央、国务院最近决定在全国范围内开展整顿清理书报刊及音像市场的活动，这是贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神的具体措施，是精神文明建设的重要步骤，关系到能否保护青少年健康成长，关系到能否把他们培养成社会主义建设的合格接班人。
    这一个多月来，“扫黄”已初见成效。全国已收缴5000多万册淫秽黄色、凶杀暴力、封建迷信的书刊以及40万盒淫秽录像带；查处了300个制黄、贩黄团伙和1800多个有关犯罪人员，对其中罪大恶极的分子依法给予了最严厉的惩处。
    但也应该看到，要取得更大的社会效益，尚需要更艰苦的努力。因为这是全社会的共同工作，单靠一个部门、一个单位是不能奏效的。
    所以，我们希望全社会的支持，把“扫黄”进行到底。特别要把集中一段时间的整顿清理与长远的治理工作结合起来，就是说要纳入法制的轨道，建立有关的长期机构。
    光是把文化毒品和垃圾清理出来是不够的，同时更重要的是多给群众和广大青少年提供健康有益的文学艺术作品，用健康有益的文艺活动占领精神文明领域。我们寄希望于广大文化艺术工作者创作更多的健康文化食粮。
