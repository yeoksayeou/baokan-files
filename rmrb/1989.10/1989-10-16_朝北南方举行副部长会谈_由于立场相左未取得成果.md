North and South Korea Hold Vice-Ministerial Talks, No Results Due to Diverging Stances

Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, October 12th – (Reporter Zhang Jinfang) Today, representatives at the vice-ministerial level from North and South Korea held their third round of talks at the "Peace House" on the South Korean side of Panmunjom. After a seven-month hiatus, the talks concluded without any results due to the divergent stances of the two sides.

During the three-hour-long third round of talks, the primary focus was on the South Korean judicial authorities' trial of Pastor Mun Ik-hwan and the representative of the "National University Student Representatives Council," Im Su-kyung. The head of the North Korean delegation, Paek Nam-jun, demanded that South Korea unconditionally release Mun Ik-hwan and Im Su-kyung to create a favorable atmosphere for North-South dialogue. The chief representative from the South, Song Han-ho, insisted that the cases of Mun Ik-hwan and Im Su-kyung were unrelated to the talks.

Regarding the naming of the prime ministerial meeting, the North proposed it be called the "North-South High-Level Political-Military Talks," while the South insisted on naming it the "South-North High-Level Government Leaders' Meeting" or "South-North Prime Ministerial Meeting." The North Korean representatives suggested that the location for the first meeting of the two prime ministers be changed from Pyongyang to Seoul, and that the number of accompanying personnel be increased from 20 to 30. The South Korean representatives did not give a clear response to these proposals.

    朝北南方举行副部长会谈  由于立场相左未取得成果
    新华社板门店10月12日电（记者张锦芳）朝鲜北方和南方副部长级代表今天在板门店南方一侧的“和平之家”举行第三次会谈。在中断了7个月后举行的本次会谈中，由于双方立场相左，未能取得任何结果。
    在今天长达3个小时的第三次会谈中，双方主要讨论了南朝鲜司法当局审判牧师文益焕和“全国大学生代表协议会”代表林秀卿的问题。北方代表团团长白南俊要求南朝鲜无条件释放文益焕和林秀卿，以便为北南对话造成有利的气氛。南方首席代表宋汉虎坚持认为文益焕和林秀卿问题同会谈无关。
    关于总理会晤的名称，北方主张称为“北南高级政治军事会谈”，而南方要求定为“南北高级当局领导人会谈”或“南北总理会谈。”北方代表提出，双方总理第一次会晤地点由其原先建议的平壤改为汉城，随行人员由20人增加到30人。对此，南方代表没有明确表态。
