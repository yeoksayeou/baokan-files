The work of attracting foreign investment in Hainan Province, China's largest special economic zone, has maintained a steady development momentum. From January to August, the province approved the establishment of 298 new joint ventures, cooperative ventures, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, with a total contract investment of over $310 million. Of this amount, foreign investment accounted for $226 million, or 73% of the total investment.

This spring and summer, central leaders such as Jiang Zemin and Li Peng reiterated that China's reform and opening-up policy remains unchanged, and that the central government's policy of developing Hainan as a large special economic zone, along with the legislative powers granted to Hainan, remains unchanged. The provincial party committee and government have repeatedly propagated these points and taken measures such as visiting investors and holding talks to address the concerns of overseas investors, alleviate their worries, and enhance their confidence in investing in Hainan. As a result, no foreign investor has withdrawn from Hainan since April. The number of new enterprises established by foreign investors in Hainan each month, as well as the investment amounts, have maintained the development pace seen in the first three months before the disturbances. There has been no decline. Some foreign investors, seeing that Hainan's situation is stable and policies are unchanged, not only continue their operations but also increase their investments. For example, the Hainan Natural Ruby Jewelry Co., Ltd., which was officially registered and opened in January this year and is engaged in the processing and sales of blue sapphires and other jewelry, recently added an investment of 2 million Hong Kong dollars to purchase equipment. They are now preparing to increase the investment by another 5 million Hong Kong dollars to further expand production.

The improvement of the investment environment is another important reason for the steady growth of foreign investment in Hainan. Over the past year, the construction of basic infrastructure such as energy, water, transportation, and communications has progressed rapidly, significantly alleviating the four major issues of electricity, water, transportation, and telecommunications that previously plagued foreign investors. The most notable improvement is in the power supply, which has seen significant development. The province has added 400,000 kilowatts of thermal power generation capacity, bringing the total installed capacity to 810,000 kilowatts. Hainan has thus transformed from a power-deficient province to one of the few power-surplus provinces in the country. In terms of the soft environment, existing investment incentives have been further improved, approval procedures have been simplified, and efficiency has been enhanced. There has been a strong campaign against corruption and for clean governance, and a concentrated effort to combat criminal and economic crimes. The previously problematic issues of "difficult access, cold reception, and hard-to-solve problems," as well as the chaotic public security situation, have seen significant improvements.

    开放政策不变 投资环境改善
    海南引进外资保持好势头
    1至8月批准新办三资企业298家，合同投资逾3亿美元
    本报海口电　我国最大经济特区海南省的引进外资工作，保持平稳发展的好势头：1至8月，全省批准新办中外合资、中外合作、外商独资经营企业298家，合同投资总额达3.1亿美元，其中外商出资额2.26亿美元，占投资总额的73％。
    今年春夏之际，江泽民、李鹏等中央领导同志重申我国改革开放的方针不变，中央对海南办大特区的方针不变、政策不变，赋予海南的地方立法权不变。省委、省府反复宣传这些内容，并采取登门访问、开座谈会等形式，有针对性地做海外投资者工作，排忧解难，使外商打消顾虑，增强安全感，投资海南的信心不减，势头不弱。据了解，4月份以来，在海南投资办企业的外商没有一家撤走。外商每月在海南新办的企业数、投资额，仍然保持了动乱前1至3月的发展速度，没有出现滑坡现象。一些外商见海南局势稳定，政策不变，不但继续干下去，而且追加投资。今年1月正式注册开业的海南天然刚玉首饰有限公司是从事蓝宝石等首饰加工、销售的香港独资企业。前不久，他们追加投资200万元港币增添设备，近日又准备增加投资500万港币，进一步扩大生产规模。
    投资环境明显改善，是海南吸引外资稳步增长的又一重要原因。一年多来，在硬环境方面，能源、水源、交通、通讯等基础设施建设进展迅速，曾经困扰外商的用电、用水、运输、电话电报四大矛盾大大缓解。最为突出的电力，如今得到超前发展。全省先后新增火力发电装机容量40万千瓦，使装机总容量达到81万千瓦，由缺电省成为全国少有的电力富裕省之一。在软环境方面，进一步完善现有投资优惠政策，简化审批手续，提高办事效率；大力肃贪倡廉，开展集中打击刑事犯罪、经济犯罪专项斗争；往日投资者最反感的“门难进、脸难看、事难办”和治安秩序混乱的状况，有了较大改观。
