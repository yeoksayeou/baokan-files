Xinhua News Agency, October 25th.

Oil prices have seen a modest increase. According to OPEC's news agency, on October 12th, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery rose by 22 cents to $20.47 per barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.

At the same time, in the European spot market, the price of Brent crude oil from the North Sea in the UK increased by 32 cents to $19.15 per barrel; the price of Dubai crude oil from the Middle East rose by 15 cents to $16.10 per barrel.

Since OPEC decided to raise its oil production quota for the fourth quarter of this year from 19.5 million barrels per day to 20.5 million barrels per day in late September, oil prices in the global market have been on a modest upward trend. By October 3rd, the prices per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, Brent crude oil, and Dubai crude oil had risen from $19.59, $17.48, and $15.33 on September 27th to $20.13, $18.60, and $16.00, respectively.

One reason for the rise in oil prices is the strong demand in the Western world. According to the International Energy Agency, the daily oil demand in the Western world for the fourth quarter of this year is expected to increase from 51.8 million barrels in the third quarter to 53.9 million barrels; the annual average daily demand is expected to reach 52.1 million barrels, an increase of 2.3% compared to 1988.

　　石油价格低幅攀升
    据欧佩克通讯社报道，美国纽约商品交易所十月十二日成交的西得克萨斯中质油十一月期货价每桶又上升了二十二美分，达二十点四七美元。
    与此同时，在欧洲现货市场上，英国北海布伦特原油每桶上涨了三十二美分，达十九点一五美元；中东迪拜原油每桶上涨了十五美分，达十六点一美元。
    自欧佩克九月下旬决定将其今年第四季度的石油生产限额从日产一千九百五十万桶上调至二千零五十万桶以来，世界石油市场的油价一直在低幅攀升，到十月三日，美国西得克萨斯中质油、英国布伦特原油和中东迪拜原油每桶价格分别从九月二十七日的十九点五九美元、十七点四八美元和十五点三三美元上升至二十点一三美元、十八点六十美元和十六美元。
    石油价格上涨的原因之一，是西方世界石油需求旺盛。据国际能源机构估计，西方世界今年第四季度的石油需求量将从第三季度的每天五千一百八十万桶上升到五千三百九十万桶；全年日平均需求量将达五千二百一十万桶，比一九八八年增长百分之二点三。　（新华社）
