Illegal Recruitment of Child Laborers; Exploitation and Beatings of Apprentices
Individual Entrepreneur Zhou Jian Arrested

	New China News Agency, Chengdu, October 30 (Reporter Wang Wenjun) The manager of Chengdu City Jinniu District Yongfeng Township Self-Reliance Leather Factory, Zhou Jian, was arrested on October 21 for illegally recruiting child laborers and mistreating and beating workers.

	In early August, a primary school teacher from Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, wrote a letter to Premier Li Peng, reporting that Zhou Jian had deceived and recruited child laborers and cruelly exploited and beat workers. Premier Li Peng immediately instructed Sichuan Province to investigate the case. On October 15, Premier Li Peng again wrote on the investigation report submitted by Sichuan Province: "In our socialist country, we must protect the physical and mental health of children and absolutely not allow such cruel exploitation and inhuman treatment to occur."

	Leaders from Sichuan Province, Chengdu City, and Jinniu District paid great attention to this case and quickly conducted investigations and evidence collection.

	It was found that Zhou Jian was originally a worker at Chengdu Starfire Leather Goods Factory. He had been sent to labor reform for three years for theft and fighting. After his labor reform period ended, Zhou Jian obtained a business license from the Chengdu Xicheng District Industrial and Commercial Bureau and set up the "Tongfu Shoe Workshop." In October 1988, without registering with the industrial and commercial department again, he privately made a seal for "Chengdu Self-Reliance Leather Factory" and used a few rented farmhouses as a base to illegally engage in the production and operation of leather. He had sent people to various counties in Sichuan Province to deceive and recruit 63 apprentices, including 11 child laborers. To prevent workers from running away, Zhou Jian required apprentices to pay a deposit of 300 yuan and living expenses of 105 yuan upon entering the factory. Of these apprentices, 38 have already been forced to leave by Zhou Jian using various means, but the deposit and living expenses have not been refunded.

	The working conditions here are extremely poor, with workers having no labor protection facilities. Living conditions are also very bad, with dozens of people crammed into two rooms. In one 22.5-square-meter damp and leaky room, as many as 32 people lived, making the room smell terrible. Due to not being able to eat enough, the workers were all thin and pale. Zhou Jian's self-drafted contract stipulated that workers would receive 35 yuan per month after working for three months, but Zhou Jian never fulfilled this, causing workers to not even have money to buy daily necessities or get a haircut. For this inhumane life, if workers had any dissatisfaction, they were lightly punished by being made to kneel or have their meals deducted, or severely beaten with fists, feet, and whips. Several workers have suffered Zhou Jian's cruel beatings. Zhou Jian also illegally controlled the workers, not allowing them to go out or talk to outsiders. Correspondence had to be reviewed, and when requesting leave to visit family, the luggage and items they carried had to be checked item by item. Zhou Jian also kept a fierce wolfdog to guard the gate. Some workers, unable to bear Zhou Jian's exploitation, found ways to escape. Currently, of the 25 workers remaining in the factory, there are still 7 child laborers, the youngest of whom is only 12 years old.

	The Chengdu City Jinniu District Industrial and Commercial Bureau, Labor Bureau, and Tax Bureau have decided to fine Zhou Jian a total of 62,597.60 yuan and order Zhou Jian to refund the 16,250 yuan deposit collected from workers when they were recruited. They must also fully pay the wages owed to the workers.

　　非法招收童工  盘剥毒打学徒
　　个体业主周坚被逮捕
    新华社成都10月30日电　（记者王文俊）成都市金牛区永丰乡自力皮革厂厂长周坚非法招收童工，虐待毒打工人，10月21日被依法逮捕。
    今年8月上旬，四川省南充县一名小学教师写信给李鹏总理，反映周坚骗招童工，肆意盘剥毒打工人的事。李鹏总理当即批示四川省查处。10月15日，李鹏总理又在四川上报的查处材料上批示：“在我们社会主义国家，要保护儿童身心健康成长，绝不允许这种残酷剥削、惨无人道的事发生。”
    四川省、成都市、金牛区的领导同志对这一案件十分重视，迅速开展了调查取证工作。
    经查实，周坚原是成都星火皮件厂工人，曾因扒窃、斗殴被劳动教养3年。劳教期满后，周坚在成都市西城区工商局办了营业执照，办起了“同福制鞋作坊”。1988年10月，他未向工商部门另行注册，又私刻了“成都市自力皮革厂”图章，以租用的几间农房为据点，非法从事皮革的生产和经营活动。他曾派人到四川省内一些县，采取欺骗手段，招收学徒工63人，其中有童工11人。为了防止工人中途逃跑，周坚要学徒工进厂时预交押金300元，生活费105元。这批学徒工中，现已有38人被周坚采用种种手段逼走，但押金和生活费分文未退。
    这里的劳动条件极其恶劣，工人们没有任何劳动保护设施，生活条件也极差，几十个人挤住在两间屋里，其中1间22.5平方米的潮湿、破漏的房子，最多时竟住了32人，屋内臭味难闻。由于根本吃不饱，工人们个个面黄肌瘦。周坚自拟的合同规定：工人做满3个月后，每月发给35元零用钱，但周坚从未兑现，致使工人们连买生活用品和理发的钱都没有。对这种非人生活，工人们如稍有不满，轻者被罚跪、扣饭，重则被拳打脚踢，皮鞭抽打，先后有十几名工人遭受过周坚残酷毒打。周坚还对工人实行非法控制，不准他们外出或与外人交谈，来往信件要经过审查，请假回家探亲，所带行李、物品也都要逐件经过检查。周坚还喂养了一条凶猛的狼狗看守大门。一些工人不堪忍受周坚的盘剥，想方设法逃离。目前留厂的25名工人中，还有7名童工，年龄最小的一人仅有12岁。
    成都市金牛区工商局、劳动局和税务局已决定对周坚处以罚款共62597.60元，并且责令周坚将招收工人时非法收取的16250元押金，如数退还给本人；如数补发拖欠工人的全部工资。
