Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, October 21st.

Yugoslav Deputy Defense Minister Brovet stated on October 21st that the Yugoslav People's Army firmly opposes the implementation of a multi-party system in Yugoslavia.

Brovet made this statement during the discussion on political system reforms at the 28th Plenum of the Yugoslav Communist League.

He emphasized that under the current conditions in Yugoslavia, the power struggles inherent in a multi-party system would not help resolve the crisis but would instead deepen it. He believed that a multi-party system would inevitably require changes to or even the abolition of the policy of general defense, fundamentally altering the nature and role of the Yugoslav People's Army, turning it into a mercenary force executing the orders of any ruling party.

He pointed out that the Yugoslav People's Army supports economic system reforms and political system reforms, but reform does not mean abandoning socialism. He expressed that Yugoslavia must adhere to the socialist path, maintain territorial integrity and constitutional institutions, and further develop the general defense system.

In the process of reforming the system, Yugoslav party and government leaders have proposed the idea of political pluralism but do not support the implementation of a multi-party system. In early March of this year, the Federal Presidency had stated that the establishment of various parties does not conform to Yugoslavia's constitutional system.

Nevertheless, since this year, some regions in Yugoslavia have successively established various social and political organizations with political programs. These opposition organizations have declared their intention to compete with the Yugoslav Communist League in social elections.

　　南斯拉夫国防部第一副部长说
　　南人民军反对多党制
    新华社贝尔格莱德10月21日电　南斯拉夫联邦国防部第一副部长布罗韦特21日表示，南人民军坚决反对在南斯拉夫实行多党制。
    布罗韦特是在21日南共联盟28中全会上讨论政治体制改革时表明这一态度的。
    他强调，在南斯拉夫目前所处的条件下，多党制的争权斗争肯定不能加速摆脱危机，相反，只能加深危机。他认为，多党制必然要求改变甚至取消全民防御方针，完全改变南人民军的性质和作用，使人民军变成执行任何执政党命令的雇佣军。
    他指出，南人民军支持经济体制改革和政治体制改革，但改革并不意味着放弃社会主义。他表示，南斯拉夫必须坚持社会主义道路，维护领土完整和宪法制度，进一步发展全民防御体系。
    在进行体制改革的过程中，南斯拉夫党政领导提出了政治多元化的主张，但并不赞成实行多党制。今年3月初，联邦主席团曾表示，成立各种政党不符合南斯拉夫宪法制度。
    尽管如此，今年以来南斯拉夫有些地区陆续成立了一些拥有政治纲领的社会政治团体。这些反对派组织扬言要在社会选举中同南共联盟竞争。
