South African Black Movement Leader Sisulu Released

Xinhua News Agency, Harare, October 16th – Correspondent Li Jingwei reports: South African African National Congress former General Secretary Walter Sisulu and seven other political activists were released from prison at 5:30 AM on the 13th.

By 7 AM, about 130 people had gathered to welcome them. When Sisulu arrived at his home, a group of young African National Congress members held up the organization's flags and sang its songs to welcome him home.

The 77-year-old Sisulu said upon stepping out of the car, "Gaining freedom is very pleasant." Sisulu was arrested in 1964 along with Nelson Mandela and sentenced to life imprisonment.

    南非黑人运动领导人西苏鲁获释
    本报哈拉雷10月16日电  记者李景卫报道：南非非洲人国民大会前总书记西苏鲁和其他7名政治活动家13日清晨5点半获释出狱。
    早晨7时，前来迎候的人们达到130人左右。当西苏鲁到达家门口时，一群年轻的南非非洲人国民大会成员举着非国大的旗帜，唱着该组织的歌曲，欢迎他获释归来。
    77岁的西苏鲁在走下汽车时说，获得自由，非常令人愉快。西苏鲁是1964年同纳尔逊·曼德拉一起被捕并判处终身监禁的。
