Various Departments Collaborate to "Sweep Yellow" and Resolutely Crack Down
Capital's Book and Audio-Visual Market Significantly Purified
Society Hopes for the Eradication of Poisonous Weeds and the Blossoming of Fresh Flowers

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 21 (Reporters Zhang Baorui, Wang Wei) The nationwide "sweep yellow" campaign is progressing swiftly and has achieved remarkable results. While the people of the capital are applauding, they also hope to build on this momentum, continue to deepen the campaign, eradicate evil thoroughly, and eliminate the sources of "yellow" materials.

Gao Shulin, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Press and Publication Bureau, told reporters that this "sweep yellow" campaign has changed the previous situation where only cultural management departments were involved. Currently, the city's book and audio-visual markets have strengthened daily management, with cultural, commercial, public security, and postal departments working together. This has significantly purified Beijing's book, periodical, and audio-visual markets. He reminded everyone that some people, under the pressure of the "sweep yellow" campaign, have already moved yellow publications underground. Therefore, the management of book and audio-visual markets should be long-term, sustained, and institutionalized to avoid being a mere "one-time effort." He stated that they will continue to focus on cleaning up libraries, document rooms, and screening points within Beijing's enterprises, institutions, and schools. For those who specialize in producing obscene videos, books, and illegal publications, they must be "eliminated root and branch." For those who are blinded by greed, selling publication numbers and periodical numbers, as well as the "middlemen" of yellow books and audio tapes, they must be resolutely dealt with to eliminate the sources of "yellow" materials.

Ge Zhi Hua, principal of Dongcheng District Fuxue Hutong Primary School, said that this "sweep yellow" campaign is a major issue concerning the physical and mental health of future generations. "Close to the red, you become red; close to the black, you become black." The environment and books have a significant impact on teenagers. According to statistics from relevant departments, 30% of juvenile sex offenders are influenced by bad books. This school has been holding weekly new book introduction activities to strengthen students' ideological education. The principal believes that the cultural market needs to be cleaned up and rectified, but more importantly, it should focus on construction. Healthy and popular literary works should be used to replace vulgar and yellow materials. He said, "Once the poisonous weeds are eradicated, fresh flowers will bloom. We hope that writers and publishing departments will write and publish more beneficial books suitable for teenagers."

Liu Ke Li, president of Yan Mountain Publishing House, told reporters that the proliferation of "spiritual poisons" is a result of the commodification of spiritual products. In recent years, two nationwide campaigns to crack down on illegal and obscene publications have been conducted, but after the "shockwaves" of the crackdowns, all sorts of publications have returned, even more ferociously. This is worth pondering. He believes that to consolidate the results of the "sweep yellow" campaign, two aspects must be noted: on one hand, the cleanup and rectification work should be institutionalized and long-term; on the other hand, the legal system should be improved, and policies should be appropriately adjusted to prevent lawbreakers from exploiting loopholes in the reforms. He suggested that the state should provide tax incentives to publishing houses to encourage the publication of good books, and at the same time, fines for publishing houses that produce bad books should be linked to relevant personnel.

Yao Wang, deputy secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, introduced that during the "sweep yellow" campaign, they focused on solving two problems: first, establishing youth cultural responsibility zones. The responsibility zones are divided by street, establishing cultural supervision posts, and cultural supervisors regularly inspect the bookstalls they are responsible for. Second, guiding teenagers, especially middle and primary school students, to read good books. Recently, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has recommended a batch of excellent books and periodicals to teenagers through activities such as "I read the book my parents loved the most" and "Songs that evoke my beautiful memories." The effects have been good.

Dong Zhen Mei, deputy director of the Beijing Women's Federation, said that some teachers and parents see yellow books flooding the street bookstalls and are anxious, writing to the Women's Federation to appeal, "Save the children!" In July last year, the Municipal Women's Federation established a popular reading club to guide readers to continuously move towards a higher level.

　　各有关部门协同“扫黄”坚决查处
　　首都书刊音像市场明显净化
    各界期望毒草除尽鲜花开放
    新华社北京10月21日电  （记者张宝瑞、王蔚）全国“扫黄”战役势如破竹，已获显著战果。首都各界群众在拍手称快的同时，更期望乘势而上，继续深入，除恶务尽，杜绝“黄源”。
    北京市新闻出版局副局长高树林对记者说，这次“扫黄”战役改变了以往由文化管理部门唱独角戏的状况。目前全市书刊市场普遍加强了日常管理，文化、工商、公安、邮电等各有关部门，协同作战，使北京的书报刊和音像市场得到了明显净化。他提醒大家注意，一些人在“扫黄”攻势的威慑下，已将黄色书刊转入地下。因此，书刊、音像市场管理作为一项长期的工作，应经常化、持久化、制度化，避免“一阵风”。他表示要继续抓好北京市企业、机关、学校内部图书馆、资料室、放映点的清理工作，对那些专门制造淫秽录像、书刊和非法出版物的黑窝子，一定要“连锅端”，对那些财迷心窍，卖书号、刊号的单位和个人，以及黄色书刊、音像带的“掮客”，要坚决查处，以杜绝“黄源”。
    北京东城府学胡同小学校长葛执华说，这次“扫黄”是关系到子孙后代身心健康的大事。“近朱者赤、近墨者黑”，环境和书籍对青少年影响甚大。据有关部门统计，现在性犯罪的青少年有30％是受了坏书的影响。这所学校为了加强学生的思想教育，近来每周都举行介绍新书活动。这位小学校长认为，文化市场需要清理整顿，更应该着眼于建设。要用群众喜闻乐见、健康的文艺作品去代替那些庸俗、黄色的东西。他说，毒草除尽，鲜花要开放，希望作家、出版部门多写、多出适合青少年特点的有益读物。
    北京燕山出版社社长刘珂理对记者说，“精神毒品”泛滥成灾，是精神产品商品化的结果。近年来，虽搞过两次全国范围的打击非法、淫秽出版物的活动，然而，打击的“冲击波”过后不久，乌七八糟的出版物又卷土重来，甚至来势更猛，这很值得人们深思。他认为，要将“扫黄”成果巩固下去，必须注意两个方面，一方面，要使清理整顿工作制度化、长期化，另一方面也要健全法制，适当调整政策，避免不法分子钻改革的空子。他建议国家在税收等方面给予出版社优惠，鼓励多出好书，同时对出坏书的出版社的罚款要跟有关人员挂钩。
    共青团北京市委副书记姚望介绍，“扫黄”中，他们重点解决了两个问题：一是建立了青年文化责任区。责任区以街道为单位划分，建立文化监督岗，文化监督员经常对所负责的书摊进行检查。二是引导青少年、特别是中小学生读好书。最近，团市委通过举办“我读父辈最喜爱的一本书”活动，向青少年推荐了一批优秀书刊；同时开展了评选“唤起我美好回忆的那些歌”等活动，效果良好。
    北京市妇联副主任董振梅说，一些教师家长看到黄色书刊充斥街头书摊，心急火焚，纷纷投书妇联呼吁“救救孩子”！去年7月市妇联开办了大众读书会，引导读者不断走向高层次。
