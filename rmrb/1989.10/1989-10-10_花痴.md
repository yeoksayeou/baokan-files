	The Flower Lover
	Gu Shitai

	I love flowers but am not good at taking care of them. Even the easiest to grow, the gillyflower, ends up withering and turning yellow in my care. In the end, I had to move it to the shared balcony and leave it to fate. Whenever I have the urge after meals or tea, I would go to the "flower lover's" place, enjoy the scent of the flowers, and satisfy my "flower craving."

	The "flower lover" is a retired teacher. Who would have thought that in his twilight years, he would develop a passion for flowers? Usually, when we meet, he greets me with a smile instead of words, busy with his flowers. With his all-out enthusiasm for flowers, the neighbors all call him the "flower lover."

	One day, after enjoying the flowers at the "flower lover's" place, I returned home and turned around to find that the gillyflower I had left on the balcony a few days ago had changed color. From its original yellow, it had turned a faint green. Surprisingly, the slender branches had sprouted buds. Upon closer inspection, I found that the soil in the pot had been loosened and fertilized. I was puzzled and wanted to ask the "flower lover," but he had already turned and gone inside.

	It was a deep, quiet rainy night. I had taken some sleeping pills and just fallen asleep when I was awakened by a rustling sound against the window. I put on my clothes, took a flashlight, and went to the balcony to find that it was the revived gillyflower swaying in the wind and rain. In a fit of anger, I broke off a few branches that were hitting the window. The next morning, when the wind and rain had stopped, I looked at the gillyflower again and found that someone had pruned the branches, added soil, and applied bandages to the broken spots. I was just about to ask the "flower lover," but he smiled at me through the glass and watched me go downstairs to work.

	Coincidentally, a few days later, my son's girlfriend was coming to visit for the first time. To decorate the small living room, I brought the gillyflower back inside. The slender, graceful branches and the buds about to bloom truly brightened up the room. However, because the room was too small, it was moved back outside after a while.

	Unexpectedly, that very night, there was a thunderstorm with lightning and howling winds. I woke up from my sleep and listened for the sound of the gillyflower on the balcony, but all I heard was the sound of rain. In the morning, I found that the gillyflower had been wrapped in a plastic raincoat. Upon closer inspection, I saw a patch of fresh blood on the black soil in the pot! I hurried to the "flower lover's" place to ask, only to find out that he had fallen while saving the flower in the rain the previous night, coughed up blood, and was rushed to the hospital. Even on his sickbed, he still remembered the flower! He was saved, and as he left, he pinched off a leaf from the flower...

	My heart trembled. Ah, truly a "flower lover" who loves flowers to the point of risking his life! With such a person, life can be filled with blooming flowers and vibrant colors. If everyone were like me, using flowers to decorate when needed and discarding them when not, how could the flowers in the world survive?

	After the "flower lover" was discharged from the hospital, the gillyflower on the balcony, which had turned yellow, was green and lush again. Now, every time I look at the thriving gillyflower on the balcony, I can't help but think of the "flower lover"...

    “花痴”
    谷世泰
    我虽然爱花，却不善养花。就连那最易栽植的柳桃，也是越养越枯黄，最后只好把它搬到室外阳台上，听天由命去了。每当饭后茶余，心血来潮，我便到共用一个阳台的“花痴”家，品品花味儿，过过“花瘾”。
    “花痴”是一位退休的老教师，谁知到了风烛残年，却得了个爱花如命的顽症。通常见面多是以笑代话，只忙他的花事。再加他对花儿那种“完全彻底”的劲头儿，邻居们都称他“花痴”。
    一日，我从“花痴”那里品花回屋，刚一转身，便发现前些天丢在阳台上的那盒大柳桃的叶子，竟然变了颜色。由原来的枯黄，生发出了淡绿。那纤细的枝条上出奇地萌生了斑斑点点的芽苞儿。再凑前几步，细看花盆里，土也松了，肥也施了。我真有些纳闷儿，想问问“花痴”，他早转身进屋了。
    那是一个更深人静的雨夜，我吃了几片安眠药，刚刚入睡，却被一阵唰唰啦啦的撞击窗棂声惊醒。我披上衣服，拿着手电，闯到阳台一看，原是那盆返青复苏的柳桃花在风雨中呼喊。一气之下，便把几根撞击窗棂的枝叶掰了下去。哪想到，翌日清晨，风息雨歇，再看那盆大柳桃，又出奇地被人修了枝，培了土，在掰下枝条的伤口上，贴了几处白胶布。我刚想去问一问“花痴”，他竟然隔着玻璃，以笑代话，目送我下楼上班去了。
    事也凑巧，不几日，儿子的女友第一次要到家里来看看。为了布置小客厅，又把那盆遗弃在外的柳桃请进屋来。啧啧，那条条婀娜多姿的细枝嫩叶和朵朵含苞待放的新蕾娇容真使满屋生辉添色了呢。只是由于居室太小，久放碍事，过后又把这盆大柳桃移到屋外去了。
    没料到，就在当天夜里，又是雷雨交加，电闪风吼。我从梦中醒来，侧耳听听阳台上那盆大柳桃的响动，却只闻一阵沙沙沙的雨淋声，而听不到枝叶摇动的撞击声。清晨起来一看，那株大柳桃正被一件塑料雨衣包裹着。细瞅去，呀！花盆的黑土上怎么留有一滩鲜红的血迹？我急转身去“花痴”家询问，才知“花痴”昨夜雨中救花不慎，跌了跤，咳了血，老病突发，住进了医院。就是病床上，他还念念不忘那盆花呢！得抢救，便手掐一片花叶儿，匆匆地走了……
    我的心顿时一抖，唉，真是个爱花不要命的“花痴”啊！有了这样的人，生活中才能百花齐放，万紫千红。如果都像我这样用花时就搬来装点门面，不用时便弃之折之，那世上的花儿们可怎么能生存下去呢？
    “花痴”出院后，阳台上那盆已经枯黄的柳桃又绿葱葱了。如今，每当我望着阳台上那株越养越旺的柳桃时，便不禁想起了“花痴”……
