I am 36 years old this year, a reporter for the *Guizhou Daily*, a "pen pusher." Whenever I recall my writing career, the scene on Red Army Mountain comes back to me.

26 years ago, I was in the third grade at Yuxin Primary School in Zunyi. I remember that year's Qingming Festival, I wore a white shirt that my mother had sewn overnight, and happily lined up with my classmates, following our teacher to Red Army Mountain to sweep the graves at the Red Army Martyrs' Cemetery.

We stood in formation in front of the tomb of Deng Ping, the chief of staff of the Red Army's Third Army Group. The teacher told us the heroic deeds of the Red Army martyrs. Then, we held an initiation ceremony. The teacher called out a name, and the new member would step forward. Senior students gave us new members red scarves one by one. We clenched our right fists and raised them to our ears, following the teacher to swear: "Always be ready, to struggle for the cause of communism."

That night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. It seemed that I had a vague understanding of the meaning of life and had something to pursue. Looking at the *Chinese Youth Newspaper* hanging on the wall, an idea flashed through my mind: to write about today's visit to the martyrs' cemetery and the initiation ceremony, and send it to the *Chinese Youth Newspaper*.

Red Army, I want to be your good descendant! That night, I wrote and wrote, finally completing a 500-word essay about the grave-sweeping event. The next day, I pasted three small chicken feathers on the envelope and quietly slipped into the post office next to the school. Thus, my first article, my chicken-feathered letter, carrying my heart, flew to Beijing.

From that day on, every day I would draw a line in my notebook, waiting and hoping for a response. On the day I drew the 24th line, the teacher handed me a letter from the editorial department of the *Chinese Youth Newspaper*. The letter said: "Your article, although it does not yet meet the requirements for publication, your active writing is commendable... We hope you and your classmates, with the help of your teachers, will write more articles and together make the *Chinese Youth Newspaper* better." Holding this letter, I read it over and over again. The teacher read this letter to the whole class and praised me. Suddenly, the classroom became lively, and my classmates looked at me with envy. From then on, I gradually developed the habit of writing something whenever I encountered something new or had some thoughts, and often sent out articles.

Just as my interest in writing was growing, the "chaos" that swept everything began. In those dark days, although I rarely sent out articles, I never forgot the scene of joining the team on Red Army Mountain and the first time I sent out an article, my heart did not sink.

History turned a new page. Through self-study, I became a news worker as I wished. In early 1985, shortly after joining the party, I and the Miao reporter Meng Yingfu volunteered to follow the Red Army's Long March route in Guizhou on foot to interview and see what changes had taken place on the land where the pioneers had shed their blood. While thousands of families were still immersed in the joy of the Spring Festival, Meng Yingfu and I bid farewell to our relatives and set out on the journey to the border of Guizhou. It took half a year, and we each walked half of the province, covering a total distance of more than 7,000 kilometers, and wrote more than 100 articles reflecting the new appearance of the various ethnic groups on the border of Guizhou. The newspaper selected 100 articles to be published in the "Guizhou Border Journey" column on the first page. *News Front*, *Journalist*, and other publications introduced this.

During the days and nights of interviewing on the Guizhou border, the early spring chill was biting, and the summer heat was unbearable. Sometimes I really couldn't hold on, but as long as I thought of the hardships of the Red Army on the Long March, thought of the joy of wearing the red scarf on Red Army Mountain, and thought of the courage of my first submission, I would smile and ask myself: Is the courage of childhood not enough now? Thus, my spirit would be invigorated again. When I arrived at the revolutionary historical site of "Rooster Crows Three Provinces" at the junction of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, because of the inconvenient transportation, I couldn't find anyone to interview. I mustered my courage, jumped into the river in flood, and swam to the other side of the land in Yunnan to complete the interview task, writing the news report "Rooster Crows—Three Provinces Respond, People Walk—Three Provinces Difficult." Later, this news report was rated as one of the best news stories of 1985. The "Guizhou Border Journey" column also won the first prize for good news in Guizhou Province in 1985. Last year, I was also rated as a labor model in Guizhou Province.

On the occasion of celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the country, flipping through the scrapbook with more than 3,000 of my published articles, I thought of the scene on Red Army Mountain 26 years ago. Countless feelings converged into one sentence: Red Army, the Republic will not forget you; Red Army Mountain, you are forever in my heart...

### “红军山”情结

    “红军山”情结
    《贵州日报》社　刘庆鹰
    我今年36岁了，是《贵州日报》记者，“耍笔杆子”的。每当回想起走笔生涯，红军山上的那一幕就重新浮现在眼前。
    26年前，我在遵义市育新小学三年级读书。记得那年清明节，我穿上母亲连夜赶做的白衬衣，高兴地和同学们排着队，在老师的带领下去红军山红军烈士陵园扫墓。
    我们列队肃立在红三军团参谋长邓萍将军墓前，老师给我们娓娓讲述红军烈士的英勇事迹。随后举行了入队仪式，老师念一个名字，这个新队员就走到前面去。高年级同学给我们新队员一一戴上红领巾。我们将右手握成拳头举向耳根，跟着老师宣誓：“时刻准备着，为共产主义事业而奋斗”。
    当晚，小小年岁的我翻来复去睡不着，似乎对人生意义突然有了朦胧的认识，有了什么追求。看着墙上挂的《中国少年报》，脑子里闪出一个念头，要把今天去烈士陵园扫墓并参加入队仪式的情况写出来，寄给《中国少年报》。
    红军啊红军，我要做你们的好后代！那天晚上，我写呀写，终于写出了一篇500多字的扫墓记。第二天，我在信封上贴了三根小小的鸡毛，然后悄悄溜进与学校一墙之隔的邮局。就这样，我的第一篇稿子，我的鸡毛信，带着我的心，飞向北京。
    自那天起，每过一天，我就用笔在本子上画一道杠，等呀等，天天盼回音，画完第24道杠的那天中午，老师转交我一封《中国少年报》编辑部寄来的信。信中说：“你的稿，虽然还达不到刊登的要求，但你积极写稿是值得表扬的……希望你和同学们在老师的帮助下，多写稿，大家一起办好《中国少年报》。”捧着这封信，我一连看了好几遍。老师向全班同学读了这封信，并表扬了我。一时间，课堂活跃了，同学们用羡慕的眼光看着我。从此，我逐渐养成习惯，遇有什么新鲜事，有点什么心思，就想涂涂划划，写点什么，并经常向外投稿。
    正当我习作兴趣颇浓的时候，横扫一切的“内乱”开始了。在那黑地昏天的日子里，我虽然很少投稿，却始终没忘记红军山上入队的那一幕和纪录这一幕的首次投稿，心未沉沦。
    历史翻过新的一页。我通过自学如愿以偿地成为一名新闻工作者。1985年初，入党不久的我同苗族记者蒙应富自告奋勇要求沿着贵州境内的红军长征路徒步采访，看看先烈们洒过鲜血的土地上究竟发生了什么变化。当千家万户还沉浸在春节的欢乐气氛中，我和蒙应富告别了亲人，分头踏上了黔边征途。历时半年，我和他每人走了半个省，总行程7000多公里，共采写反映黔边各族人民新风貌的稿件100多篇，报社挑选100篇作花边新闻发在一版的“黔边行”专栏里。《新闻战线》、《新闻记者》等载文对此作了介绍。
    在黔边采访的那些日日夜夜，早春寒气袭人，盛夏酷热难熬。有时真坚持不住了，但只要一想到当年红军长征途中的千辛万苦，一想到红军山上戴上红领巾的喜悦，一想到第一次投稿时“无所畏惧”的勇气，我就笑而自问：难道现在还不如儿时勇气足？于是精神又抖擞起来。当我来到云贵川交界的革命历史重地“鸡鸣三省”时，因交通不便，找不到人采访，我壮着胆子，跃入正发洪水的河里，游到对岸云南的土地上，才完成采访任务，写出《鸡鸣——三省应，人行——三省难》的通讯。后来，这篇通讯被评为1985年全国好新闻。“黔边行”专栏也获贵州省1985年好新闻特等奖。去年，我还被评为贵州省劳动模范。
    欢庆建国40周年之际，翻阅着辑有我发表的3000多篇杂稿的剪贴本，我又想起了26年前红军山上那一幕。万千感慨，聚成一句话：红军啊红军，共和国不会忘记你们；红军山啊红军山，你永在我心间……
