As educators, we must use a high sense of social responsibility to educate our students. To educate students well, we must understand them.

During a parents' meeting, a middle-aged woman, tears in her eyes, bowed to me: "Teacher Shi, you are truly our family's great benefactor!" She showed the audience a series of certificates: "Dai Lezhi, Excellent Student," "Dai Lezhi, Top in Middle School Exams." In my excitement, scenes from the past flashed through my mind:

Dai Lezhi was once a notorious troublemaker in our school. Two years ago, his mother brought him to my office. I knew: another burden was being placed on me! Instinctively, I waved my hand to refuse. His mother was in tears. Dai Lezhi was a boy at his wit's end, and I had turned him away, which truly pained me. The next morning, I went to Dai Lezhi's home. My intentions were clear, and the welcome I received was obvious.

After Dai Lezhi started school, he behaved for a couple of days, but then problems started to arise. Sometimes, he would disrupt a class with a strange shout; other times, a female student would suddenly get hit by a slingshot. Once, during a class, a group of young people from outside the school rushed in. It was later found out that Dai Lezhi had invited them. In a fit of anger, I asked his parents to take him back home. That night, I couldn't sleep. How could an educator, responsible for shaping souls, abandon a student out of momentary anger and fear of trouble? I thought, if I genuinely put my heart into it, wouldn't Dai Lezhi be moved?

The next day, I brought Dai Lezhi back to school. The students said I had the heart of a bodhisattva but the face of Judge Bao. Students who used to keep their distance from me started to warm up to me, and those who were usually unruly said, "Teacher Shi is so caring; we must bring honor to our class." Dai Lezhi also decided to "straighten up and be a good person."

I used the class's book corner to cultivate the students' noble character. I encouraged the entire class to subscribe to newspapers and magazines, hold clipping activities, and regularly conduct post-reading discussions. I found that Dai Lezhi was gradually forming a vague sense of social responsibility and justice. However, he had a strong sense of "brotherhood." I knew that if I used abstract doctrines to correct this misguided and stubborn sense of brotherhood, it would only make him resentful. I decided to deepen our mutual understanding. Eventually, we reached a point where we could talk about anything. At this point, I could educate Dai Lezhi effectively.

For a long time, I have cared for and loved my students with a sense of social responsibility, educating them according to the needs of the country and society. Our class finally transformed from a "hornet's nest" into a "magpie's nest." In the civilized and disciplined competition activities, our class often won the title of advanced class collective. During the graduation exam, our class had the highest pass rate and excellent rate in the school. This year, our class was rated as an excellent class collective in Shaoyang City.

### 塑造灵魂要有社会责任感

　　塑造灵魂要有社会责任感
    作为灵魂工程师，要用高度的社会责任感去教育学生。教育好学生，必须理解学生。
    在一次家长会上，一位中年妇女噙着泪水向我鞠躬：“石老师，你真是我家的大恩人哪！”她向讲台下展示一张张奖状：“戴乐之，三好学生”、“戴乐之，中考全校第一名”。激动之余，我的脑海里浮现了一幕幕往事：
    戴乐之同学原是我校鼎鼎有名的“闹将”。两年前，由他母亲带着走进我的办公室。我明白：又一个累赘要往我这里塞了！我本能地发出了摆手动作。他妈妈泪流满面。戴乐之正是一个处于穷途的少年，而我却把他拒之门外，实在于心不忍。第二天上午，我找到了戴乐之的家。我表明来意后，所受到的欢迎是不言而喻的。
    戴乐之同学上学后，规矩了两三天，接下去麻烦事就层出不穷。或好好的一堂课被他一声怪叫给搅了；或某个女同学冷不丁地挨了一弹弓。一次，正在上课，一伙社会青年冲进教室，后来查到原来是戴乐之引来的。一气之下，我要他家长把他领了回去。当天夜里，我无法入睡了。一个灵魂的工程师怎能因一时之气和惧祸心理，而放手不管？我想，只要我精诚所至，还怕他戴乐之不为所动吗？
    次日，我再次把戴乐之领来，同学们说我是菩萨心肠包公脸。过去对我敬而远之的同学跟我亲热起来了，一向不安份的学生也表示：“石老师这么重感情，我们要为班集体争光。”戴乐之也决心“捆起脑壳做好人”。
    我利用班上的图书角，培养学生们高尚的情操。我发动全班同学订阅报刊，开展剪报活动，并定期开展读后感座谈会。我发现戴乐之正在逐步形成一种朦胧的社会责任感和人生正义感。但他带有很重的“哥们义气”。我深知，如果用抽象的教条去扭转这种偏激、固执的“哥们义气”，反而会使他反感。我决定增进相互之间的理解。最后，我们终于到了无话不说的地步。这时，我就可以得心应手地教育戴乐之了。
    长期以来，我以社会责任感去关心和爱护学生，按祖国和社会的要求去教育学生。我们班终于变“马蜂窝”为“喜鹊窝”了。在文明守纪竞赛活动中，我们班经常荣获先进班集体称号。毕业统考时，学生合格率和优秀率我们班是全校最高的。今年，我们班被评为邵阳市优秀班集体。
