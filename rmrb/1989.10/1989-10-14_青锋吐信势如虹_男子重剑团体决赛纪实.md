The last gold medal of the first Asian Fencing Championship was for the men's épée team event. China did not have an advantage in this event and lost to the opposition in the 10th Asian Games. Before the competition, experts did not have high hopes for the team.

On the afternoon of the 13th, when the men's foil team gold medal was unexpectedly taken by the South Korean team, and the South Korean team's gold medal count surpassed ours by one, the young men of the Chinese épée team suddenly felt the weight on their shoulders increase.

Obviously, the South Korean team had long considered this gold medal as theirs. Each of their players would shout as they stepped onto the fencing strip to boost their morale. The Chinese fencers who participated in the final match were not intimidated. When they raised their swords to salute the referee and the audience, they exuded a fierce spirit and were full of confidence.

The first to take the field for China was Du Zhencheng. He moved lightly on the fencing strip, seizing every opportunity. Within the allotted time, he scored three hits against the opponent, while the opponent scored none. Du started off with a victory. In the second match, China's Yang Wenrong lost to South Korea's Jang Tae-sik. In the third match, the main players of both teams took the field. China's representative was Ma Zhi, who finished sixth in the épée individual event at this year's World University Games. South Korea's representative was Yang Da-sik, who had just won the men's épée individual championship at this Asian Championship. The two fought fiercely, and Ma Zhi ultimately won by one hit. In the fourth match, China's Xu Xuening lost to South Korea's Lee Sang-geun. Thus, the total score was tied at 2-2.

Immediately, Yang Wenrong and Du Zhencheng took the field again and both won their matches. In the seventh match, Xu Xuening, due to lack of experience, lost to the men's épée individual runner-up Jang Tae-sik. However, from this point on, the score of the South Korean team on the total scoreboard did not advance by a single point.

In a dramatic turn of events, in the tenth match, Xu Xuening took the field for the third time. Obviously, he was unwilling to end the match without scoring a single point. When the score was behind, he equalized at 4-4. After a brief pause, with only two seconds left in the allotted time, Xu Xuening struck with lightning speed and scored a hit. The bell rang and the light came on, and he joyfully rolled on the ground.

The South Korean team seemed to be in disarray, while the Chinese fencers fought with increasing ferocity, their swords moving like dragons, completely overwhelming the opponent in terms of morale. In the end, they defeated the opponent with a score of 9-3.

The leader of the Chinese fencing team, Zhang Zheng'en, excitedly told the reporter that after losing to the South Korean team in the Asian Games, the Chinese athletes had been harboring a grudge. They endured hardships and honed their skills, finally achieving today's victory. This is a breakthrough for China's épée project.

    青锋吐信势如虹
    ——男子重剑团体决赛纪实
    第一届亚洲击剑锦标赛的最后一枚金牌是男子重剑团体。中国队在这个项目上并不占优，在第十届亚运会上负于对手，赛前并未被行家看好。
    13日下午，当男子佩剑团体的金牌出人意料地被南朝鲜队夺走，南朝鲜队金牌数超出我队一枚之后，中国重剑队的小伙子们突然觉得肩上的担子加重了。
    显然，南朝鲜队早把这枚金牌视为囊中之物，他们每位选手走上剑台，都要吼一声，以壮声色。参加决赛的中国剑手们毫不示弱，当他们举剑向裁判和观众致意时，虎气生生，充满自信。
    中国队首先上场的是杜震城，他在剑台上轻松地跳跃着，捕捉每一个战机。在规定的时间内，他三剑刺中对方，而对方却一分未得，小杜旗开得胜。第二场，中国的杨文勇负于南朝鲜的张泰锡。第三场，双方主力披挂上阵。中国队上场的是今年世界大学生运动会获重剑个人第六的马志，南朝鲜队为刚刚摘走本届亚洲锦标赛男子重剑个人桂冠的梁达植。双方杀得天昏地暗，马志最后以一剑优势险胜。第四场，中国的许学宁不敌南朝鲜的李相箕。这样，双方总比分战成2∶2。
    紧接着，杨文勇、杜震城再度出阵，双双告捷。第七场小许因经验不足，又输给男子重剑个人亚军张泰锡。但是自此之后，在两队的总比分表上，南朝鲜队的得分数字就再未前进一步。
    极具戏剧性的是第十场，许学宁第三次出场，显然他不甘心自己一分未得，在比分落后的情况下追成4平。双方暂停后，离规定时间仅剩两秒钟。最后一瞬间，许学宁以迅雷不及掩耳之势突刺成功。铃响灯亮，他高兴地在地上打了一个滚。
    南朝鲜队显得有些军心涣散，而中国选手却越杀越猛，剑如游龙，完全从气势上压倒了对方，最后以9∶3大胜对手。
    中国击剑队领队张政恩激动地对记者说，自亚运会输给南朝鲜队之后，中国选手一直憋着一股气。他们卧薪尝胆，砥志磨剑，终于取得了今日的胜利。这对于我国重剑项目来说，可称为一个突破。
