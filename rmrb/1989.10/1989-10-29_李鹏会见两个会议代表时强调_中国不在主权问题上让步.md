Li Peng met with representatives of two conferences this morning at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, emphasizing that China will not compromise on sovereignty issues.

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 28 (Reporter Zhou Aiguo) Premier Li Peng warmly received representatives attending the China Bank Overseas Branch Managers Conference and the China People's Insurance Company Overseas Company General Managers Conference this morning.

Li Peng, on behalf of the State Council, extended a warm welcome to everyone. He said that during the spring and summer of this year, the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing had a significant impact on the overseas business of the Bank of China, causing considerable difficulties, a phenomenon unprecedented since the founding of the nation. The representatives stood firm against the tide, maintained the credibility of the Bank of China, and upheld the dignity of the People's Republic of China. Li Peng expressed his heartfelt thanks to everyone for their efforts.

Li Peng said that China's modernization construction requires a long-term peaceful international environment. In handling international affairs, we will consistently adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and are willing to develop friendly cooperative relations with countries around the world in various fields and at various levels, including cooperation and exchange in the financial and insurance sectors. He said, we adhere to opening up to the outside world, but we will not make concessions on matters of principle or on issues of China's sovereignty.

Li Peng said that the Bank of China is our country's foreign exchange bank, which has developed significantly in recent years and enjoys a good reputation worldwide. The insurance business is a component of the financial industry and social security, playing an active role in the country's economic construction and other undertakings, and is a promising new industry. Li Peng hopes that the broad cadre of bank and insurance workers, both at home and abroad, will continue to study their business, summarize experiences, strengthen information exchange, make friends, do their work well, and make new contributions to the modernization construction.

Ji Pengfei, Li Guixian, Luo Gan and other comrades participated in the reception.

    李鹏会见两个会议代表时强调
　　中国不在主权问题上让步
    新华社北京10月28日电  （记者邹爱国）国务院总理李鹏今天上午在钓鱼台国宾馆亲切接见了出席中国银行海外分行行长会议、中国人民保险公司海外公司总经理会议的代表。
    李鹏代表国务院对大家表示热烈欢迎。他说，今年春夏之交，北京发生的反革命暴乱，使中国银行的海外业务受到相当大的冲击，带来了一定的困难，这是建国以来从未有过的现象。各位先生、各位同志顶住了这股逆流，保持了中国银行的信誉，维护了中华人民共和国的尊严。李鹏衷心感谢大家为此所作出的努力。
    李鹏说，中国进行四化建设，需要一个长期的和平国际环境。在处理国际事务中，我们将始终不渝地坚持和平共处五项原则，愿意以此为基础同世界各国发展多领域、多层次的友好合作关系，包括金融和保险领域的合作与交流。他说，我们坚持对外开放，但决不会在原则问题上、在中国的主权问题上让步。
    李鹏说，中国银行是我们国家的外汇银行，近几年来有了很大的发展，在世界上享有声誉。保险业务是金融事业和社会保障事业的一个组成部分，对国家的经济建设和其它事业都发挥着积极的作用，是一个有发展前景的新型事业。李鹏希望从事银行和保险业务的广大海内外职工不断钻研业务，总结经验，加强信息交流，广交朋友，做好工作，为四化建设继续作出新的贡献。
    姬鹏飞、李贵鲜、罗干等同志参加了接见。
