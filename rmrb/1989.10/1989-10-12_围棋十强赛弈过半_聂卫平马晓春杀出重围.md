Reporter Miú Lǔ reports from Beijing, October 11th: Today, the Go Ten-Strong Tournament, featuring the most renowned Go players, has reached its halfway point. The top players, Nie Weiping and Ma Xiaochun, have emerged as leaders, firmly holding the top two positions.

This tournament is divided into two groups for a round-robin format, with the final rankings determined by matches between players of the same rank from different groups. Nie Weiping, who has won both of his matches so far, today defeated Ke Wei nine-dan by a margin of one and a quarter points, significantly increasing his lead and effectively securing the first place in his group. In the other group, Ma Xiaochun nine-dan has won all four of his matches. Today, his final group match was against Yu Bin eight-dan.

The match between Ma and Yu, although it ended after only 146 moves, featured intense strategic battles between these two highly skilled players known for their sharp minds. Yu Bin initially made several brilliant moves, gaining the upper hand and effectively deploying his black stones. The amateur referee, who was specially invited to officiate, was so engrossed in the game that he often forgot to record the moves. However, Ma Xiaochun remained calm and composed, meticulously planning his strategy. In the mid-game, after considering for several tens of minutes, he finally decided on his winning plan. He used two isolated stones in the center to create a decoy, feigning a sacrifice to lure the opponent into making a slow move. Even the wisest can make a mistake. Yu Bin, in the midst of his winning momentum, failed to notice the trap and fell into Ma Xiaochun's "feint east, strike west" strategy. Ma Xiaochun then smoothly connected his two isolated stones, making them alive, while Yu Bin's formation became riddled with holes and unmanageable. In the end, Yu Bin had no choice but to concede defeat.

    围棋十强赛弈过半
    聂卫平马晓春杀出重围
    本报北京十月十一日讯　记者缪鲁报道：今天，由知名度最高的围棋国手参加的十强赛刚过半程，弈林翘楚聂卫平和马晓春已脱颖而出，稳稳占住了头两把交椅。
    这次比赛先分两组进行单循环对弈，然后两组同名次者对局确定最后排名。已两战两胜的聂卫平今天以一又四分之一子的优势击败芮乃伟九段后，积分大大领先，实际上已获本组第一。另一组的马晓春九段则四战皆捷，他今天遇上的组内最后一个对手是俞斌八段。
    马俞之战虽然只投下一百四十六个子便分出胜负，但这两位同以神思灵动著称的高手，竭智尽虑，均使出了浑身解数。先是俞斌妙着迭出，尽占先机，布下的黑子，粒粒大见其效，以致主办者特意请来执法的业余裁判看得如痴如醉，常常忘了及时记谱。然而，马晓春却始终成竹在胸，不动声色地盘算构想。进入中盘后，他经过几十分钟长考终于定下致胜方略，利用中腹的两条孤棋布下疑阵，摆出弃子假象，诱使对方走出缓着。智者千虑，果有一失。俞斌在胜势大炽之际一时不察中了对方声东击西的圈套，让马晓春从容地在空隙处靠出，把两片孤棋连成一体，干净成活，而自己的阵脚却因此漏洞百出，不堪收抬。最后，俞斌只好收手认负。
