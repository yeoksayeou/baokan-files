    江泽民会见阿拉法特
    强调中国坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民斗争
    本报北京10月5日讯　记者温宪报道：中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在中南海会见了巴勒斯坦国总统阿拉法特。
    江泽民对阿拉法特说：“我一方面对你的来访表示热烈欢迎，另一方面对你当选为巴勒斯坦国总统表示补充祝贺。我看到你的日程安排很紧张，来去匆匆啊！我很钦佩阁下充满活力。”他还说，今天上午，邓小平同志以85岁的高龄出来会见你这位老朋友，这正表明我们之间的友谊是很深厚的，也表明中国对巴勒斯坦人民斗争的支持是坚决的。
    在谈到中东问题时，江泽民说，巴勒斯坦人民虽然面临许多困难，但根据我们多年艰苦奋斗的体会，困难往往会带来光明的前景。巴勒斯坦人民的斗争是艰巨的、长期的。我深信，只要巴解组织和巴勒斯坦人民团结一致，坚持斗争，就一定会在阿拉法特总统领导下取得最后的胜利。
    阿拉法特向江泽民介绍了中东地区当前形势、中东问题症结所在，以及巴解组织关于和平解决中东问题的方案。他说，这一方案已经得到许多国家的反应和支持。
    阿拉法特对中国政府和中国人民一贯坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争再一次表示由衷感谢。
