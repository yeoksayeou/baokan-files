Jinan, Oct. 10 (Xinhua) -- Since the establishment of the loan "separation of approval and lending" system five months ago, the Jinan branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has cumulatively issued loans totaling over 300 million yuan, with a repayment rate of 93.7% upon maturity. Among these, 80% of the loans supported the production of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Simultaneously, 31 instances of loans that should have been issued but were not, as well as various relationship-based and irrational loans totaling over 13 million yuan, were identified and blocked, ensuring the rational allocation of funds. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China recently held a credit work conference in Weihai, Shandong Province, promoting this practice.

For a long time, credit work has been conducted under the system of "one person entering the factory, collecting loans, and managing them, with approval and lending combined, and dual signatures for loans." This system lacks scientific rigor and transparency, and phenomena such as personal relationships, substandard loans, and using loans for personal gain have occasionally occurred. Some funds have been allocated irrationally, leading to overdue loans and risky loans.

In March of this year, this bank began exploring the establishment of a scientific credit management and constraint mechanism, implementing the loan "separation of approval and lending" system in its eight subordinate district and county branches. They selected a group of cadres with good moral character, strong business capabilities, and solid work styles to serve as loan approval officers, and established an approval committee composed of the credit, accounting, planning, and audit departments, implementing a "one loan, three reviews" system: the credit officer conducts a thorough investigation and makes the first review; the approval officer reviews based on national industrial and product policies and the bank's credit structure adjustment policies, making the second review; the approval committee makes the third review. According to the regulations, credit officers have the authority to conduct pre-loan investigations and post-loan supervision; approval officers have the authority to review loans and supervise collections; the approval committee has the authority to make final approvals. Each authority is separated, mutually supervising and constraining each other, aiming to use limited funds effectively.

A certain enterprise with relatively good economic performance was classified as a second-class enterprise during the bank's classification. In May of this year, the enterprise applied for a loan of 1.5 million yuan, which the credit officer approved after investigation. However, the approval officer, upon review, believed that although the enterprise was an object of bank support, their products did not align with the current national industrial policy, and thus did not approve the loan, leading to a disagreement. Later, after collective research by the approval committee, this loan was rejected.

### 增加贷款科学性透明度  济南工商行实行“审贷分离”

    增加贷款科学性透明度
    济南工商行实行“审贷分离”
    本报济南电　济南市工商银行建立贷款“审贷分离”制度5个月来，累计发放贷款3亿多元，到期回收率达93.7％，其中80％的贷款支持了国营大中企业的生产。在此同时，查出、堵住应贷而未贷、各种关系和不合理贷款31笔，共1300多万元，保证了资金的合理投向。中国工商银行最近在山东威海市召开的信贷工作会议，推广了这一做法。
    长期以来，信贷工作实行“一员进厂，收贷统管，审贷合一，双签批贷”做法，缺乏科学性和透明度，人情、关系、劣质贷款和以贷谋私等现象时有出现。一些资金的投向不合理，有的造成了逾期贷款和风险贷款。
    今年3月，这家银行开始探索建立一套科学的信贷管理和约束机制，在下属的8个区县行处实行贷款“审贷分离”制度。他们选拔一批思想品质好、业务能力强、作风扎实的骨干担任贷款审贷员，成立由信贷、会计、计划、稽核等部门组成的审贷委员会，实行“一贷三审”：信贷员认真调查后作出一审；审贷员根据国家产业产品政策和银行调整信贷结构政策作出二审；审贷委员会作出三审。按规定，信贷员只有贷前调查权和贷后监督权；审贷员有贷款的审查权和收贷监督权；审贷委员会有审定权。各权分离，相互监督，相互制约，以求把有限的资金用在刀刃上。
    有家经济效益较好的企业，在银行分类排队时被划为二类企业。今年5月，该企业申请贷款150万元，信贷员调查后同意发放，而审贷员审查后认为，该企业虽是银行支持的对象，但他们的产品不符合当前国家产业倾斜政策，所以不同意贷，双方发生了分歧。后来，经审贷委员会集体研究，否决了这笔贷款。
