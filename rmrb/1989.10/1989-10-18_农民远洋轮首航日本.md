Chinese farmers' ocean-going ship "Quanzhou" set sail from Yantai today on its maiden voyage to Japan. This marks the first time a village-run enterprise in China has engaged in international shipping, adding a new chapter to the maritime history of New China.

The Danish-built ocean-going cargo ship was jointly invested in by the New Mu International United Enterprise Company, led by one of China's top ten farmer entrepreneurs, Chang Zonglin, and the China Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation, among other units. The ship was purchased from Hong Kong for $4.9 million.

After its maiden voyage to Japan, the "Quanzhou" will also sail to Southeast Asia and Hong Kong.

According to Captain Yu Cai Fu, the "Quanzhou" is a highly modernized multi-purpose container ship with a capacity of 4,448 tons. It can carry 258 standard containers and 40 refrigerated containers, and has the ability to load and unload cargo independently.
