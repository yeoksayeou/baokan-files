In 1988, our county carried out a reform of professional and technical titles. Some individuals, in order to secure a title, staged a series of farcical acts of fraud.

Scene One: During the cultural and professional examinations for title applicants, examiners were astonished to find that students in their late teens had entered the examination room to take the test. Additionally, there were instances of friends taking exams for each other, and wives assisting their husbands from outside the examination room. Such incidents, which were discovered on the spot by examiners, amounted to more than 10 cases.

Scene Two: A young technician in the chemical laboratory of a certain county bureau, in order to be promoted to assistant engineer, changed his year of birth from 1964 to 1960 and his year of employment from 1981 to 1975. Such falsified application materials were smoothly submitted to the evaluation committee. There were 46 such cases of falsified resumes in the entire county.

Scene Three: Educational background is a crucial requirement for title applicants. Consequently, some schools ran out of their stock of diplomas; a school established in August 1956 even issued a certificate of education for 1954.

Scene Four: A deputy secretary of a party branch in an enterprise, who was not within the scope of title evaluation as a political worker, concealed the fact that he had held various party and government positions since 1973, including positions in the county revolutionary committee, commune party committee, commune revolutionary committee, and township party committee. He changed his current position to deputy factory manager. Through this "roundabout" process, he successfully obtained the title of economist. According to policy regulations, there were 26 people in the county who were not within the scope of title evaluation but still obtained titles. Some people, after evaluating in an institution, felt they were at a disadvantage and then went to an enterprise for a second evaluation, thus advancing their title level.

Why did such a situation arise? This is mainly due to the extreme irresponsibility of some unit leaders in the title reform work. Some enterprise leaders explicitly stated that as long as the applicant dared to fill out the form, they would be responsible for submitting it; they turned a blind eye to and tolerated the production of fake diplomas and resumes. In one enterprise, out of 68 applicants for junior titles, 23 were found to have committed fraud. Some units even organized special teams to obtain fake certificates for those who did not meet the conditions.

Since March of this year, the county committee has decided to seriously investigate and punish violations in the title reform. Some units have changed their previous closed attitude and implemented a system of "four publicities": policy regulations, standards, personal application materials, and evaluation results. County-level agencies with review tasks have set up more than 40 complaint boxes to accept public supervision at any time.

Recently, the county committee held an expanded meeting of the standing committee and formally decided to revoke the professional and technical titles of 93 people who had obtained them through fraud, recall all issued title appointment letters and title salaries, and report the matter to the entire county; those who committed serious fraud will be subject to party and administrative disciplinary actions. County Committee Secretary Zhang Yanjun clearly stated: We will continue to investigate the violations in the title reform, both punishing those who obtained titles through fraud and dealing with the units and individuals who issued fake certificates, and holding the unit leaders who were seriously irresponsible accountable.

### 评职称弄虚作假演闹剧  迁西县严肃查处不姑息

    评职称弄虚作假演闹剧  迁西县严肃查处不姑息
    1988年，我县进行专业技术职称改革工作。一些人为了评上职称，演出了一幕幕弄虚作假的闹剧。
    镜头之一：在职称参评人员文化、业务考试中，监考人员惊奇地发现十八九岁的在校学生竟进入考场答卷。此外，朋友顶替朋友考试的，妻子在场外给场内丈夫打接应的，真可谓无奇不有！这类事件当场被监考者识破的竟有10多起。
    镜头之二：县某局化验室一名青年化验员为了评上助理工程师，明明是1964年出生，1981年参加工作，却把参加工作时间改为1975年。这样的申报材料却一路顺风地被上报到评审委员会。这类搞假履历的职称参评人员全县多达46人。
    镜头之三：学历，对每个职称参评人员可以说是个硬条件。于是，一些学校库存的毕业证书被一抢而空；1956年8月建立的学校，竟为有的人开出了1954年的学历证明。
    镜头之四：一家企业党支部副书记作为政工人员本不在职称参评范围，为了获得经济师职称，他在申请报告任职一栏中，隐瞒了自己曾从1973年开始，先后担任过县革委政治部干事、公社党委副书记、公社革委会主任、乡党委书记等党政职务，并将自己的现任职务改为副厂长。经过这番“转弯抹角”的工作，他终于评上了经济师。全县按政策规定不在职称参评范围之内而获得职称的就有26人。有的人在事业单位参评后，自认为吃了亏，又跑到企业第二次参评，于是，他们的职称等级又上了一个台阶。
    为什么会造成这种状况呢？这主要是一些单位负责人对职称改革工作极端不负责任。一些企业领导人明确表态，只要申报人敢填，他就负责给上报；对搞假文凭、假履历的违纪行为听之任之，放纵不管。有一家企业在上报的68名初级职称申请人中，就有23人弄虚作假。有的单位还组织专门力量，为不符合条件的职称参评人员四处去搞假证件。
    今年3月以来，县委决定严肃查处职称改革中的违纪问题。一些单位一改过去的封闭状态，实行政策规定、标准、个人申请材料、评审结果“四公开”制度，县直机关有复查任务的单位设立各种举报箱40多个，随时接受群众监督。
    最近，县委召开常委扩大会议，正式决定取消93人骗取的专业技术职称，全部收回已发的职称聘书和职称工资，通报全县；对严重弄虚作假的给予党纪、政纪处分。县委书记张彦钧明确表示：对职称改革中的违纪行为要继续深入调查，既要查纠骗取职称者，又要处理出具假证的单位和个人，并追究严重不负责任的单位领导者的责任。
