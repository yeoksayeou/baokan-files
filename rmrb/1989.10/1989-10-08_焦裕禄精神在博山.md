Boshan, Shandong, is the hometown of Jiao Yulu.

In the mid-1960s, the name of Jiao Yulu, a model county committee secretary, spread across the mountains and rivers of China. Over the course of more than 20 years, Jiao Yulu's name had been covered in dust, once forgotten and neglected. But the people did not forget him. His hometown, where he was born and raised, never forgot him either. His spirit, tempered by the passage of time, shone ever brighter, and his name once again echoed through the mountains and rivers of his homeland. In early 1987, a new district committee was formed. They often pondered a question: What can be used to purify people's souls, enlighten their thoughts, unite their spirits, and further inspire their enthusiasm for reform and construction?

Soon, the decision-makers' thoughts converged on a common point: In the new historical conditions, the people of Boshan District should take the lead in carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu, using the spirit of Jiao Yulu to unite the will of the people, invigorate the spirit of the people, and promote the reform and construction of the entire district. They quickly made a decision to launch an activity centered on learning the spirit of Jiao Yulu throughout the district, focusing on the "three spirits": the spirit of Jiao Yulu, who dedicated his life to the people's interests and worked tirelessly until his death; the spirit of Lei Feng, who served the people wholeheartedly; and the social spirit of "I for others, others for me." They aimed to lead the people's customs with the party's customs, to unite the will and strength of the people of the entire district with the spirit of the times that is characteristic of Boshan, and to build a more beautiful hometown for Jiao Yulu.

To this end, the district committee and district government immediately restored the "Jiao Yulu Memorial Hall," using it as an important venue for conducting revolutionary tradition education for the broad masses of party members, cadres, and the people. Facing a severe drought this year, the leaders of Boshan District took the lead by example, bringing their own bedding, leaving the office, and rushing to the front lines of drought relief and disaster rescue. In less than a week, urban and rural residents spontaneously donated 1.1 million yuan, providing strong support for the people in the disaster-stricken areas.

The mountains and rivers of Boshan nurtured the people's good son, Jiao Yulu, and the spirit of Jiao Yulu is now inspiring the people of Boshan to strive for the construction of a more beautiful Boshan.

    焦裕禄精神在博山
    山东博山，焦裕禄的故乡。
    60年代中期，县委书记的好榜样——焦裕禄的名字传遍了中国大地的山山水水。20多年的风风雨雨，焦裕禄的名字也曾蒙上过尘埃，一度被淡漠和遗忘。但人民没有忘记他，生他养他的故乡更没有忘记他，他的精神在时代的磨砺中愈发放射出夺目的光芒，他的名字又回荡在故乡的山水之间。1987年初，新的区委组成。他们经常考虑的一个问题是：用什么来净化人们的灵魂，启迪人们的思想，凝聚人们的精神，进一步激励人们改革和建设的热情呢？
    很快，决策人的思绪在一个共同点上聚焦：在新的历史条件下，博山区人民要带头弘扬焦裕禄精神，用焦裕禄精神凝聚人民的意志，振奋人民的精神，推动全区的改革和建设事业。他们迅速做出决策，在全区开展以学习焦裕禄精神为中心的发扬“三种精神”活动，即为人民利益鞠躬尽瘁、死而后已的焦裕禄精神，全心全意为人民服务的雷锋精神，我为人人、人人为我的社会精神，以党风带民风，以具有博山特色的时代精神，聚合全区人民的意志和力量，把焦裕禄的家乡建设得更美好。
    为此，区委、区政府立即修复了“焦裕禄事迹展览馆”，以此作为向全区广大党员、干部、群众进行革命传统教育的重要场所。面对着今年一场特大的旱灾，博山区的领导同志率先垂范，自带铺盖，走出机关，奔赴抗旱救灾的第一线。城郊居民们在不到一周的时间，就自动捐款110万，有力地支援了灾区的群众。
    博山的山山水水，养育了人民的好儿子焦裕禄，焦裕禄的精神又正激励着博山人民为建设一个更美好的博山而努力奋斗。
