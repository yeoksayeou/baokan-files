Title: I Wish to Be Drunk in the Hearts of Children

I am 23 years old, and I have spent nearly half of my life in elementary school—six years as a student and five years as a teacher.

In 1984, I graduated from a teacher's college and unexpectedly returned to my alma mater, the elementary school in Hépō Village, Lǔlóng County. It was the same courtyard, the same willow trees in the small playground, and the same classroom with rough desks and chairs. My first teaching assignment was for a fifth-grade class, and it happened to be the same classroom where I had studied in fifth grade.

I remember the first time I taught, when I read aloud, "The sunset shines on the small lake..." My eyes welled up with tears.

But it wasn't long before I actually cried.

A boy with a short haircut had dirt and grass leaves stuck in his hair, his face was smeared with sweat and dirt, sometimes he would come to class barefoot, carrying his shoes, and he had drawn telephone lines on his arm with a ballpoint pen. His jacket and undershirt were scribbled with words, and when he stood in front of me, he had a salty smell of sweat. He blinked his eyes and laughed mischievously. This was the typical appearance of a mischievous boy from the countryside.

The first time I took attendance, a few of these "little devils" started mimicking me, causing the whole class to burst into laughter. Later, when I was teaching, they would make faces behind my back, poke each other, and play pranks, often pulling some kind of mischief.

The adults advised me, "To be a teacher, you have to 'scare' them into behaving!"

The first time I tried to "scare" them, I practiced in front of the mirror for half an hour the night before. The next day, I used this tactic on the "little devils." But when I looked at them, they were tilting their heads and rolling their eyes. As soon as I let them go, they laughed and ran off.

So, I really got angry, and my face turned pale. Once, a "little devil" played with ballpoint pen ink all over his face and hands during class, and even smeared a big patch on the white jacket of the girl in front of him. I was so angry that I dragged him out of the classroom. He clung to the desk and refused to let go, causing the entire class to fall into chaos.

So, I cried out of frustration.

I fell ill and didn't go to school for a day. The students, however, came to my home to visit me, even bringing apples. The "little devils" stood at the front, their eyes gentle and timid (the principal had scolded them), and they kept handing me apples. Suddenly, I felt my small room filled with childlike innocence. What lovely children!

Later, I heard from the adults that the "little devils" had also been discussing behind my back, saying that my lectures were interesting and included some amusing stories. So, my heart warmed even more.

I have always loved children's literature and have many stories in my heart. So, I started telling them stories.

Once, during a language arts class on "Listening to Stories, Writing Summaries," I told the story of "Little Luka Drives Away the German Soldiers." I acted out the story, vividly describing how Little Luka drew poisonous snakes and hung them on pine trees to scare away the German invaders who were raiding the village. Seeing the children listening intently, I was also captivated, feeling as if I had returned to my childhood and my heart had merged with theirs.

The "little devils" gathered around me, becoming more and more obedient. When winter came, I led them to the "second classroom"—quiz competitions, playing table tennis, and organizing theme team activities like "Me in the Year 2000"... I truly became a "king of the children"!

The following year, I became the school's Young Pioneers' League advisor. I established the "Star and Torch" broadcasting group and the bulletin board group. I wrote the good deeds of each class in lively and interesting children's literature, accompanied by music and broadcasted. Each team had communicators and little reporters, and the "little devils" in each class loved to stay in the Young Pioneers' activity room and reading room. The "lazy students" and "troublemakers" all became diligent and disciplined. Every day, I felt so fulfilled and happy in the world of children's hearts.

Once, I led the children to a nursing home to do good deeds. I heard someone behind me say, "Why does this teacher look like a child?" When I got home, my mother also said, "You're getting older every year, and it's time to start a family. You can't keep being a 'king of the children.'"

"But listen to the Party! Go ahead, child! The country needs such 'kings of the children,'" my father, a retired teacher, understood my heart the most and encouraged me.

My father's words are right. Being a "king of the children" is wonderful! They have childlike innocence and will always be among the children; and aren't the children the future of our republic?

I wish to spend my life immersed in the world of children's hearts.

    我愿醉在童心里
    河北省卢龙县蛤泊乡小学　杨子东
    今年23岁的我，几乎有一半时间在小学里度过——当了6年的小学生，5年的小学教师。
    1984年中师毕业，想不到又返回育我的母校——蛤泊乡小学。又是这门院，又是这垂柳小操场，又是这桌椅粗糙的教室。我第一次任教五年级，竟又是我小学五年级的那间教室。
    记得第一次上课，朗读第一句：“夕阳照在小湖上……”眼睛一热，竟有些湿润。
    但没多久，我便真的哭出泪水了。
    小平头上粘着泥土、草叶，脸蛋上花花黑黑的汗道儿，有时赤着脚拎着鞋，胳膊上用圆珠笔画了电话线，白袄和背心写上字，往你跟前一站还有汗咸味儿，眨着眼睛嘻嘻笑，乡村的男孩子就这么副顽皮样。
    我第一次点名，就有几个这样的“小鬼头儿”拉腔扯调，引得全班哄堂大笑。以后上课，我在前面讲，他们就在后头做鬼脸，捅捅左右，逗逗前后，常常来点恶作剧。
    大人们传授我：“当老师就得‘凶’住他们！”
    我第一次“凶”他们，头天晚上还在灯下对着壁镜演练半天。第二天，就对“小鬼头儿”们倒出这一套。可一瞧，他们歪着小脑袋，直翻小眼皮。刚一放他们走，就哧哧乐着，撒欢儿蹦走了。
    于是，我真的生气，脸都气白了。一次，一个“小鬼头儿”上课玩了满脸满手圆珠笔油，还把前面女同学的白袄抹了一大块。我气极了，拽他出去。他死拉住课桌不放，课堂全乱套了。
    于是，我委屈得失声哭起来。
    我病了，一天没去学校。同学们却拥来家中看我，还买了苹果。“小鬼头儿”们站在最前面，眼睛温顺顺的，怯生生的（原来校长批评了他们），还直往我手中递苹果。我一下子觉得我的小房中充满了童趣。多可爱的孩子！
    后来，听大人们反馈：“小鬼头儿”们也在背后议论，说我讲课语言动听，还夹着一些有趣的小故事。于是，我心更热了。
    我从小就爱好儿童文学，心里有好多好多的故事。于是，我就讲给他们听。
    有一次语文课是“听故事，写大意”。我讲了《卢卡智退德国兵》。我带着动作，绘声绘色地讲小卢卡怎么画毒蛇，挂在松树上，吓退了进庄扫荡的德寇。看见孩子们听得痴呆呆的，我也迷醉了，仿佛回归童心，和孩子们的心融合在一起了。
    “小鬼头儿”们围着我转，一天比一天听话。到了冬天，我领他们上“第二课堂”——抢答竞赛，吹乒乓球，搞主题中队活动——谈《2000年的我》……我真的成一个“孩子王”了！
    第二年，我当了学校少先大队辅导员。我开办了《星星火炬》广播组和板报组。我把各班的好人好事写成形式活泼、趣味盎然的儿童文学作品，配上乐播出。各中队都有了通讯员、小记者，各班的“小鬼头儿”们都爱钻在少先队活动室、阅览室里，“学习懒蛋”、“淘气包儿”，一个个地变得好学、守纪律了。每一天，我都觉得在童心世界中，过得那么充实和快乐。
    有一次，我领孩子们去敬老院做好事，听见背后有人说：“怎么这个老师像孩子头似的！”回家了，妈妈也说：“一年大似一年，快成家了，可不能再当这个孩子头了。”
    “别听别人的，听党的！干吧，孩子！国家就需要这样的孩子头。”爸爸是退休老教师，最懂我的心，他一个劲地鼓励我。
    还是爸爸的话对。当“孩子头”美着呢！他们拥有童心，永远在孩子中；而孩子，不正是我们共和国的未来吗！
    我愿一辈子沉醉在童心世界里。
