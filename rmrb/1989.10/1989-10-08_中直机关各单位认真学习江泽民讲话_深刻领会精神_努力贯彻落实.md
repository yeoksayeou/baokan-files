Central directly affiliated units are seriously studying Jiang Zemin's speech and deeply understanding its spirit, striving to implement it.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 7th: After Jiang Zemin's speech at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was published, the various units of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China organized serious study and discussion. In the discussion, various units generally believed that Jiang Zemin's speech has both practical relevance and profound historical significance. It is a guiding document for unifying the thoughts of the entire party and guiding future work. Everyone expressed that they must deeply understand the essence of the speech and strive to implement it in all aspects of work.

The standing committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection believed in the study and discussion that Jiang Zemin's speech, from the combination of theory and practice, expounds on major issues that the entire party and the people of the whole country are very concerned about. It will have a major and far-reaching impact on adhering to the four cardinal principles, promoting socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up. The leading comrades of the General Office of the Central Committee believed in the discussion that the four basic conclusions summarized by Jiang Zemin in his speech and the ten important issues expounded upon, well reflect Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and are completely in line with China's national conditions. They pointed out that the study of Jiang Zemin's important speech should be combined with the study of Deng Xiaoping's several important speeches recently and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Through study, promote work, and let each unit have a new spirit, strive to implement the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session, and carefully do the work of serving the Central Committee of the Party. The Organization Department believed in the study and discussion that the theme of Jiang Zemin's speech is to walk the socialist road. It is the guiding principle for all work at present and has important guiding significance for the party's ideological construction. It is necessary to organize party members and cadres to seriously study and implement it.

The comrades of the Central Party History Research Room believed that Jiang Zemin's speech has pointed out the direction for doing a good job in party history research work, especially for the research on the 40-year history of the founding of the nation, which has important guiding significance. It has opened up the research field for party history research work and expanded new research topics. The comrades of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions believed that Jiang Zemin proposed in his speech to strengthen the leadership of the working class, which felt very close to the heart. The working class has shown a firm political stance and spirit of sacrifice in the long-term revolution and construction. As long as we rely wholeheartedly on the working class, our cause will be invincible. The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League proposed that Jiang Zemin's speech emphasized the need to be vigilant and prevent "peaceful evolution" and strengthen youth education, which is a major issue related to China's future. This fully reflects the concern and love of the Central Committee of the Party and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries for the younger generation, and the high attention and enthusiastic support for youth work. This speech has extremely important guiding significance for doing a good job in all aspects of work in the new situation.

The leading comrades of the Central United Front Work Department believed in the discussion that the four basic conclusions summarized by Jiang Zemin in his speech make people clearly and firmly realize that without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, it will not work; without walking the socialist road, it will not work; without adhering to socialist reform and opening up, it will not work; without relying on the leadership of the working class, it will not work; without using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the entire party, it will not work. The editorial board of the People's Daily believed in the discussion that Jiang Zemin's speech is very important and timely, and is the action program for doing a good job in the party's propaganda work and all work, and is the basis for us to do a good job in the newspaper. Everyone expressed that they must seriously study and implement it. The Party School of the Central Committee proposed to well implement the spirit of the speech in teaching and scientific research work, enrich the content of lectures; at the same time, to formulate scientific research topics around the major theoretical and practical issues proposed in the speech, write articles, and strengthen theoretical propaganda work.

The leading comrades of the Central Work Committee believed that the study of Jiang Zemin's speech should be closely combined with concentrating on doing a good job in the party's construction within the organization. In order to study and implement the spirit of Jiang Zemin's speech, the Central Work Committee issued a notice on October 5th, requiring the organizational party committees to organize all party members and cadres, especially leading cadres at all levels, to seriously study Jiang Zemin's speech, deeply understand the spirit, and unify their thoughts to the spirit of the speech. It is required that in the study, closely combine with the actual situation of thoughts and work, combine the study with solving the ideological problems of the masses, combine it with the implementation of the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session, especially combine it with the current strengthening of the party's construction, and promote the various work of the organizational party.
