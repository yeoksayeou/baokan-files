In modern society, people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation are almost inseparable from plastic. From small toothbrushes to car engines, plastic products can be found everywhere. Taking the United States as an example, it produces 270 billion kilograms of resin annually. The annual sales of plastic products reach 15 billion dollars. Some people call the 20th century the "Plastic Century."

As people become increasingly dependent on plastic, they unwittingly face a growing crisis. Because plastic does not decompose easily, the disposal of plastic waste has become a headache. One-third of plastic is used to make disposable items. These products have a lifespan of only a few months before they quickly become waste. In recent years, some beaches in the United States have been polluted by floating plastic objects (some of which are discarded plastic products from hospitals), drawing serious attention from the public. Plastic waste dumped into the ocean poses a threat to marine animals.

Eighty percent of the waste in the United States is disposed of by burying it in landfills. Experts predict that these landfills will be exhausted in one or two decades. Plastic products account for one-quarter of solid waste and are rapidly increasing.

In the past two years, the United States has enacted nearly 800 laws to manage waste, especially plastic waste, such as imposing packaging taxes and requiring products to be biodegradable, to increase the cost of plastic products. Some regions have outright banned certain plastic products, such as disposable plastic coffee cups and hamburger boxes. However, if disposable plastic diapers are banned, it would force the largest diaper manufacturer, which produces 1.6 billion dollars worth of diapers annually, to shut down. The United States discards 16 billion diapers each year, accounting for one percent of all waste, and the environmental impact is significant.

Currently, there are three main solutions: recycling, incineration, and landfilling. Recycling has the issue of sorting, as not all plastics can be recycled. This requires significant investment. Processing one ton of plastic waste costs 200 dollars, and the United States produces 250 million tons of waste annually. Although some companies that use a lot of plastic are researching recycling, this waste is related to the plastic industry, packaging industry, and consumer goods industry. No one wants to lead in investing in this area, so progress is slow. Another option is to use waste as fuel for power generation. However, burning certain plastics can cause pollution, and such plants are too costly. A plant that processes 3,000 tons of waste per year requires an investment of 300 million dollars, limiting people's enthusiasm. Landfilling is also not a long-term solution because landfills are limited, and burying one ton of waste costs 27 dollars. In practice, due to a lack of water and oxygen, waste buried underground for many years often does not decompose, let alone plastic waste.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set a goal for handling plastic waste by 1992: such as reducing plastic waste by 25 percent; increasing the recycling rate from 0.2 percent to 25 percent; increasing the incineration rate from 9 percent to 20 percent; and maintaining landfilling. Judging from the current situation of handling plastic waste, achieving the above goals is still difficult.

    塑料垃圾带来的危机
    张允文
    在现代社会中，人的衣食住行几乎都离不开塑料。从小小的牙刷到汽车发动机都可以找到塑料制品。以美国为例，每年生产的树脂就达二百七十亿公斤。塑料产品的年销售额达一千五百亿美元。有人把二十世纪称为塑料的世纪。
    当人们越来越离不开塑料的时候，却不知不觉地被塑料推向一场日益严重的危机。由于塑料不大会腐烂，塑料垃圾的处理就成为令人头疼的难题。塑料中三分之一是用于制造一次性用品的。这些产品的使用寿命仅数月，很快就变为垃圾。近年来美国的有些海滩就被一些塑料漂浮物
  （其中有一些是医院扔弃的塑料制品）所污染，引起舆论界的严重关注。塑料垃圾扔入海洋，危及海洋动物。
    美国的百分之八十垃圾是用埋入地坑的方法处理的。据专家预测，埋垃圾的地坑一、二十年即将告罄而塑料制品在固体垃圾中占四分之一，并且还在迅速增加。
    近两年来，美国各州制定了近八百项法律来管理垃圾，尤其是塑料垃圾，如课以包装税、要求该制品具有可腐烂性等，以提高塑料制品的成本。有的地区干脆禁止使用某些塑料制品，如禁止使用一次性塑料咖啡杯和汉堡包盒等。但是有的日用品，如一次性塑料尿布一旦遭禁，将迫使年产十六亿美元尿布的最大尿布制造商停产。而美国每年要扔掉一百六十亿块尿布，占全部垃圾的百分之一，其环境影响可想而知。
    目前解决的办法无非是三种：回炉、焚烧、地埋。回炉有个分捡的问题，因为并不是所有塑料都能回炉的。这需要大量投资。处理一吨塑料垃圾要花二百美元，而美国每年的垃圾多达两亿五千万吨。虽然一些使用塑料较多的公司正在研究塑料的回炉问题，但这种垃圾同塑料业、包装业、消费品业都有关系，谁也不愿意在这方面带头投资，因此进展缓慢。另一条出路是作燃料发电。但是某些塑料燃烧后会造成污染，而且这种工厂成本太高，一年处理三千吨垃圾的工厂需投资三亿美元，人们的积极性也受到限制。地埋也非长久之计，因为地坑有限，每埋一吨垃圾需花二十七美元。实践证　明，由于缺水缺氧，垃圾埋入地下多年也往往并不腐烂，更不用说塑料垃圾了。
    美国环境保护部拟定了到一九九二年的处理塑料垃圾的目标：如减少塑料垃圾百分之二十五；回炉率从百分之零点二提高到百分之二十五；焚烧率从百分之九提高到百分之二十；保留地埋垃圾等。从目前处理塑料垃圾的情况来看，上述目标还难于全部实现。
