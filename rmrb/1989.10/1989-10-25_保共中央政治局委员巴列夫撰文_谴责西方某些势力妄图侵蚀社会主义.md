Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 23rd.

Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Baley, wrote in an article published in the *Worker's Cause* newspaper on October 23rd that capitalist countries have always attempted to use the increasing mutual connections between the East and West to achieve their class and national selfish goals. Certain Western forces are attempting to use this to erode socialism.

Baley further pointed out that certain Western groups have distorted the reforms of socialist countries as the failure of socialism and are attempting to use this as an opportunity to exert pressure, forcing socialist countries to accept their conditions for dialogue. He expressed his firm belief that socialist countries have sufficient ability to achieve self-improvement and will see a revival under new socio-economic conditions.

　　谴责西方某些势力妄图侵蚀社会主义
    新华社索非亚10月23日电　保共中央政治局委员巴列夫23日在《工人事业报》发表文章指出，资本主义国家一直企图利用东西方之间的相互联系日益增加的客观倾向，达到其阶级的和民族利己主义的目的。西方某些势力妄图以此侵蚀社会主义。
    巴列夫进一步指出，西方某些集团把社会主义国家的改革歪曲为社会主义的破产，并企图借机施加压力，迫使社会主义国家接受它们的对话条件。他表示坚信，社会主义国家有足够能力实现自我完善，并将在新的社会经济条件下出现振兴。
