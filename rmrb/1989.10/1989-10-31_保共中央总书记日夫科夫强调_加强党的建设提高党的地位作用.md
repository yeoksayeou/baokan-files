The General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Todor Zhivkov, emphasized in his written report to be presented at the upcoming Central Committee plenary session that under new conditions, it is necessary to strengthen party building and enhance the party's status and role as the vanguard political force of the whole society.

The Central Committee plenary session, scheduled for November 10, will discuss the further advancement of the reform process at this stage and the preparation for the 14th Party Congress to be held in early 1991. The *Rabotnichesko Delo* newspaper published the full text of Zhivkov's written report to the plenary session on October 29, inviting comments from party members and various sectors of society.

In his report, Zhivkov stressed the need to further enhance the party's role in strategic planning. He said that the party's long-term strategic guidelines should currently be subordinated to the task of creating a new socialist model in Bulgaria and resolutely carrying out revolutionary changes that can revitalize contemporary socialism. He believes that "we must abandon the concept of a developed socialist society proposed by the 10th Party Congress (1971) and accept the view that we are still in the initial stage of building a new society." He said, "The Bulgarian Communist Party will not change its nature. Although the Bulgarian Communist Party has proposed new ideas for further building socialism in Bulgaria, we have no intention of drafting a new party program."

Zhivkov pointed out that to overcome the serious difficulties encountered in the reform process and to advance the reform, at least three key issues must be addressed: First, economic reform and political reform must be integrated and become a unified whole; second, the blind obedience in the national economic management mechanism, which has been formed over several decades, must be overcome; third, the role of external factors in Bulgaria's economic development must be correctly understood and handled. In addressing this issue, one must consider the profound changes brought about by the scientific and technological revolution in the contemporary world and adapt to the requirements of the world economy and international market.

　　保共中央总书记日夫科夫强调
　　加强党的建设提高党的地位作用
    新华社索非亚10月29日电　保共中央总书记日夫科夫准备在即将召开的中央全会上作的书面报告中强调，在新的条件下，要加强党的建设，提高党作为全社会的先锋政治力量的地位和作用。
    定于11月10日召开的保共中央全会，将讨论进一步推进现阶段的改革进程和准备1991年初举行的保共14大的问题。《工人事业报》29日刊登了日夫科夫将向全会作的书面报告的全文，以便听取党员和社会各阶层的意见。
    日夫科夫在报告中强调，要进一步提高党在制定战略方面的作用。党的长期战略方针当前要服从于在保加利亚创造新的社会主义模式这一任务，要坚决完成能再现当代社会主义活力的革命性变革。他认为“必须放弃保共10大（1971年）提出的发达社会主义社会的提法，要接受这种观点，即：当前我们仍处在建设新社会的初级阶段”。他说，保共绝不会改变党的性质，“尽管保共提出了在保加利亚进一步建设社会主义的新构想，但是，我们没有任何打算要制定新党纲”。
    日夫科夫指出，为了克服改革进程遇到的严重困难和推进改革，至少要解开三个症结：第一，要综合实行经济改革和政治改革，使两方面的改革成为一个统一体；第二，必须克服几十年造成的国民经济管理机制的盲从；第三，要正确认识和处理外部因素在保加利亚经济发展中的作用。对待这一问题要考虑改革和当代世界在科技革命的影响下不断发生的深刻变化，要适应世界经济和国际市场的要求。
