    A major case of concealing prohibited books and publications has been uncovered in Xining. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, October 22nd (Reporters Wang Hongwei and Hua Weilie), the Xining City Cultural Inspection Team recently, based on a tip from the public, uncovered a major case of concealing prohibited books and publications. On the spot, 170 packages and bags of prohibited books and publications were seized, totaling 27,391 volumes.

    The owner of this batch of prohibited books and publications is Bear Bin, the manager of Wenhai Bookstore in Xining City and an individual book dealer. He was originally a worker at a plastics factory in Xining City. In 1983, he applied for leave with pay and has since been engaged in individual book and publication business. In July of this year, after the nationwide rectification and clean-up of the book and publication market began, relevant departments in Xining City inspected the two shops he operated in Xining City and confiscated more than 3,500 volumes of prohibited books and publications in accordance with the law. Subsequently, Bear Bin became acquainted with Zhou Weiping, the manager of the Qinghai Provincial Library Book and Publication Binding Comprehensive Service Department, and through Zhou Weiping, rented a warehouse from the provincial library to hide a large number of prohibited books and publications.

    Currently, Bear Bin has been taken into custody by the authorities, and the case is still under further investigation.

　　西宁查获一起隐匿违禁书刊大案
    据新华社西宁10月22日电  （记者王宏伟、华卫列）西宁市文化稽查队最近根据群众举报，查获一起隐匿违禁书刊大案，当场收缴违禁书刊170包、袋，计27391册。
    这批违禁书刊的主人是西宁市文海书店经理、个体书商熊斌。他原是西宁市一家塑料厂的工人，1983年办理留职停薪手续后专门从事个体书刊经营活动。今年7月，全国清理整顿书报刊市场活动开始后，西宁市有关部门对其在西宁市开设的两爿铺面进行了检查，依法收缴其违禁书刊3500余册。此后，熊斌与青海省图书馆书刊装订综合服务部经理翟卫平结识，并通过翟卫平租借了省图书馆一所仓库，将大批违禁书刊转移该处隐匿。
    目前，熊斌已被依法收审，该案正在进一步审理中。
