Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 19th.

China's stance on Taiwan remains unchanged. We firmly oppose any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," or to engage in dual recognition.

The People's Daily, Beijing, October 19th. Reporter Gù Yùqīng reports: Foreign Ministry spokesperson Li Zhaoxing today, at a press conference, commented on Belize's establishment of diplomatic relations with Taiwan following Grenada and Liberia. He pointed out that the Chinese government's stance on the Taiwan issue is unwavering. We firmly oppose any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," or to engage in dual recognition. Our government is seriously addressing the erroneous behavior of the Belizean government in violating the principles of the Sino-Belizean joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations.

Li Zhaoxing said, recently, the authorities in Taiwan have been actively seeking to promote their "flexible diplomacy" and "dollar diplomacy," using economic aid, loans, and even bribes to lure some economically struggling countries that have diplomatic relations with us. They aim to establish diplomatic relations and develop official ties, even attempting to achieve dual recognition, create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and split China. We hope people remain vigilant about this.

He went on to point out that there is only one China in the world, namely the People's Republic of China, and its government is the sole legal representative of the whole of China. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This has long been recognized by the international community. We firmly oppose countries that have diplomatic relations with us from establishing official relations or engaging in official exchanges with Taiwan. China will be reunified, which is the trend of the times and the will of the people. No force can stop it. The actions of the authorities in Taiwan contradict their own repeatedly stated stance of "adhering to one China," and will inevitably arouse the indignation and opposition of all Chinese people at home and abroad who support the peaceful reunification of the motherland. We believe that any attempt to sabotage China's reunification will not succeed.

    中国对台湾立场不变
    反对任何制造“两个中国”、“一中一台”或搞“双重承认”的企图
    本报北京10月19日讯　记者顾玉清报道：中国外交部发言人李肇星今天在新闻发布会上就继格林纳达、利比里亚后，伯利兹同台湾建交一事发表谈话时指出，中国政府关于台湾问题的立场是坚定不移的。对任何制造“两个中国”、“一中一台”或搞“双重承认”的企图，我们都是坚决反对的。我国政府正在严肃对待伯利兹政府违背中伯建交公报原则的错误行为。
    李肇星说，最近，台湾当局四处活动，大肆兜售其“弹性外交”、“银弹外交”，利用经援、贷款，甚至重金收买等手段，拉拢一些与我建交的经济困难的国家，谋求与它们建交和发展官方关系，甚至企图搞“双重承认”，制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”，分裂中国。我们希望人们对此保持警惕。
    他接着指出，世界上只有一个中国，即中华人民共和国，其政府是代表全中国的唯一合法政府，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。这早已被国际社会所公认。我们坚决反对同我建交的国家同台湾建立官方关系或进行官方往来。中国要统一，这是大势所趋，人心所向，是任何势力都阻挡不了的。台湾当局的所作所为违背了它自己一再宣称的“坚持一个中国”的立场，必将激起海内外一切赞成和平统一祖国的中国人民的义愤与反对。我们相信，任何破坏中国统一大业的企图都是不会得逞的。
