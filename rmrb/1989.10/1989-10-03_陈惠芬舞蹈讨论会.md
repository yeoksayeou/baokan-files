The South China Military Region Cultural Department and the Chinese Dancers Association, taking advantage of the national military arts performance, jointly organized a solo dance evening for young dancer Chen Huifen. Chen Huifen performed several of her recent creations, including "Star River," "Bull and Mountain Child," "Duckling," and "Mountain Spirit," as well as well-known works like "Little Sailor" and "Picking Mushrooms." On September 16, the organizers held a seminar on Chen Huifen's dance. Dance theorists and critics spoke, agreeing that the 26-year-old Chen Huifen not only demonstrated her creative talent but had also begun to develop a unique personal style, which is rare in the Chinese dance world. They discussed Chen Huifen's dance from various angles, including her choice of themes, language characteristics, aesthetic orientation, and cultural qualities.

    陈惠芬舞蹈讨论会
    南京军区文化部、中国舞蹈家协会，借全军文艺调演之机，联合举办了青年舞蹈家陈惠芬舞蹈专场晚会。陈惠芬表演了最近几年创作的《星星河》、《悍牛与山童》、《鸭丫头》、《山鬼》以及早已为人所知的《小小水兵》、《采蘑菇》等。九月十六日主办单位召开了陈惠芬舞蹈研讨会，舞蹈理论家、评论家纷纷发言，认为年仅二十六岁的陈惠芬不仅显示了创作的才华，也初步形成了与众不同的个人风格，这在中国舞坛上尚不多见。他们从陈惠芬的舞蹈取材角度、语言特征、审美取向、文化品格等多方面进行了探讨。
