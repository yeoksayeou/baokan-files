Geographer Hou Renzhi Announces Research Findings: Beijing Has Been a City for Over 3,000 Years

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 14th – Beijing has been a city for 3,034 years. Today, at a meeting held after the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference inspected Beijing, renowned geographer Hou Renzhi announced this research finding.

Professor Hou said that there have been various opinions regarding the earliest time Beijing was established as a city, but there has never been a definitive conclusion. Based on historical records, archaeological findings, and the views of many scholars, I believe that the earliest time Beijing was established as a city should be the 11th year of King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty. A bronze ritual vessel from the Zhou Dynasty unearthed in Liu Li River in the southwestern suburbs of Beijing confirms this inference. The inscription on the vessel records the historical fact of the Zhou Dynasty enfeoffing Yan.

According to the "Records of the Grand Historian," in the 11th year of King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty, King Wu defeated King Zhou of the Shang Dynasty. Without even getting off his chariot, King Wu enfeoffed the descendants of the Yellow Emperor in Ji and appointed the Duke of Zhou in Yan. This enfeoffment changed the situation of primitive settlements in the region of You and Yan, marking the beginning of a 3,000-year history of a city.

The 11th year of King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty corresponds to which year in the Gregorian calendar? Japanese astronomer Shin Shinzō calculated based on the recorded activity period of Halley's Comet, which should be 1066 BC. The Purple Mountain Observatory recalculated and found it incorrect. Zhou Dynasty expert Zhao Guangxian from Beijing Normal University, in his research on the chronology of the Zhou Dynasty, concluded that the 11th year of King Wu should be 1045 BC. Professor Hou Renzhi, based on his own research, believes that this view is relatively reliable.

    地理学家侯仁之公布研究成果
    北京建城已有三千多年
    新华社北京10月14日电　北京建城至今已有3034年。今天在全国政协委员视察北京后的座谈会上，著名地理学家侯仁之公布他这一研究成果。
    侯教授说，关于北京建城的最早时间说法有多种，但一直没有结论。我据史料、文物考证及多家学者所述，认为北京建城的最早时间应为周武王11年。北京西南郊琉璃河出土的一只周代铜礼器中的铭文证实了这一推断。铭文中记述了周封燕的史实。
    据《史记》记载，周武王11年伐纣，商纣灭亡，武王未及下车，封黄帝之后于蓟，召公于燕。这一分封，改变了幽燕大地原始聚落的状况，开始了一座城市3000年的历史。
    周武王11年为纪元何年？日本天文学家新诚新藏据史书记载哈雷彗星活动周期推算，应为公元前1066年。紫金山天文台重新计算后认为不确。北京师范大学周史专家赵光贤在研究周代纪年时考证，武王11年应为公元前1045年，侯仁之教授据自己研究，认为这种说法较为可靠。
