People's Daily, Chengdu, October 12th - Reporter Lu Maocheng reports: In response to new situations and problems that have arisen in enterprise contract management, the Sichuan Provincial People's Government recently decided to further improve the enterprise contract responsibility system. Clear regulations have been made for certain issues to stabilize hearts, activate enterprises, and dispel doubts among the managers of contracted enterprises.

It is understood that in the past two years, Sichuan's implementation of the enterprise contract system has achieved significant economic benefits. In 1988, the contract coverage of budgetary state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises in the province reached 95.5%, with an annual output value increase of 14.4%, sales revenue increase of 28.5%, profit realization increase of 35.8%, and tax and profit remittance increase of 21.9%. However, since the contract management system is a new thing, some contract management agreements are not yet perfect, and there are many problems in implementation. Some managers either dare not exercise their production and operation decision-making powers boldly, or engage in short-term behavior, hesitating whether to continue contracting, which has affected production and operation to a certain extent.

To dispel doubts and reverse the passive situation in production and operation, Sichuan Province reaffirms: once a contract management agreement is established, neither party can arbitrarily change or terminate it. The industrial and commercial administrative departments are responsible for the supervision, arbitration, and management of the contract. The notarization departments notarize the contract. The contracted enterprises should formulate annual targets based on the overall target during the contract period and conduct annual assessments. The phenomenon of "contracting profits but not losses" should be eliminated. Enterprises that do not complete their annual remittance tasks will not be compensated for the deficit, and retained profits will be used to make up the shortfall; if the shortfall cannot be made up, it will be temporarily handled as an outstanding account, but it should be fully made up within the contract period. The main task of the enterprise party organization is to strengthen party building, participate in the discussion of major enterprise issues, adhere to the socialist direction of the enterprise, and support the manager in exercising their powers in accordance with the law. Mid-level cadres in the enterprise are nominated by the manager or recommended by the party committee, and after discussion by the party and government leadership collective, are appointed and dismissed by the manager. The rewards and punishments for managers must be executed according to the contract, strictly assessed, and resolutely implemented.

    稳定人心搞活企业
    四川完善企业承包制
    根据新情况新问题作出明确规定
    本报成都10月12日电　记者罗茂城报道：针对企业承包经营中出现的新情况和新问题，四川省人民政府最近决定，进一步完善企业承包责任制，对某些问题重新作出明确的规定，以稳定人心，搞活企业，消除承包企业的厂长（经理）的疑虑。
    据悉，近两年四川实行企业承包制取得了明显的经济效益。1988年，全省预算内国营工交企业的承包面达到95.5％，年产值增长14.4％，销售收入增长28.5％，实现利润增长35.8％，上交税利增长21.9％。但是，由于经营承包制是一个新事物，有的承包经营合同还不够完善，实行中存在不少问题。有的厂长（经理）或者不敢大胆行使生产经营决策权，或者短期行为严重，对今后是否继续承包犹豫不决，使生产经营受到一定程度的影响。
    为了消除顾虑，扭转生产经营的被动局面，四川省重申：承包经营合同一经订立，任何一方均不能随意变更或解除。工商行政管理部门负责承包合同的监证、仲裁和管理。公证部门对承包合同进行公证。承包企业在承包期内应按照总目标制订出年度目标，逐年考核。要杜绝包盈不包亏的现象。对未完成年度上交任务的企业不补欠，用企业留利补足；不能补足的暂作挂帐处理，但应在承包期内全额补足。企业党组织的主要任务是搞好党的建设，参与讨论企业的重大问题，坚持企业的社会主义方向，要支持厂长（经理）依法行使职权。企业中层干部由厂长（经理）提名，或党委推荐，经党、政领导集体讨论后由厂长（经理）任免。对经营者的奖罚必须按合同执行，严格考核，坚决兑现。
