As of 18:00 today, the Jinan Railway Bureau has achieved the milestone of 1000 consecutive days without major or significant train accidents for the first time, entering the ranks of the safest railway operations in the country.

The Jinan Railway Bureau is located at the intersection of the Jinghu and Jiaoji railways, with five branch lines and over 120 stations under its jurisdiction. The bureau handles an average of over 300 trains daily. Due to the high density of train operations, heavy traction, and high speeds, the bureau was once known for frequent accidents. From its establishment in 1950 to 1986, the bureau experienced 287 major and significant accidents over 36 years, averaging about 8 accidents per year.

To reverse the passive situation in safety production, the bureau focused on standardizing operations. Various safety measures have been implemented down to the team and individual levels. Currently, the bureau has established 2352 standardized teams, accounting for 84% of the total teams; and 68 red flag and standardized stations, accounting for 85% of intermediate stations.

　　济铁分局安全行车千日
    本报济南10月23日电　截至今日18时，济南铁路分局首次实现连续1000天无行车重大事故和大事故，跨入全路安全行车先进行列。
    济铁分局地处京沪、胶济两大铁路干线交汇点，所辖铁路支线5条、车站120多个，日均接发列车300多列。因线路行车密度大、牵引重、速度高，该局曾是一个事故多发的分局。自1950年建局到1986年的36年间，全分局共发生重大事故和大事故287件，平均每年8件。
    为扭转安全生产的被动局面，该分局众抓作业标准化入手，把各项安全措施落实到了班组和岗位。目前，全分局已建成标准化合格班组2352个，占班组总数的84％；建成红旗、标准化车站68个，占中间站的85％。
