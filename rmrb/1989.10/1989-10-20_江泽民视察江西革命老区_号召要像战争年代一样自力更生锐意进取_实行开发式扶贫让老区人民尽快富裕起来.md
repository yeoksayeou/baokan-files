Jiang Zemin Inspects Jiangxi Revolutionary Old Areas
Calls for Self-Reliance and Innovation Like in the War Years
Implements Development-Oriented Poverty Alleviation to Quickly Enrich the People of the Old Areas

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, October 19 - "Although we no longer eat red rice and pumpkin soup like we did during the Jinggangshan struggle, the glorious revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan must never be forgotten," Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, repeatedly emphasized during his inspection of Jinggangshan.

On October 13, General Secretary Jiang Zemin arrived in Jiangxi. Accompanied by Mao Ziyong, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee, and Wu Guanzheng, Governor of Jiangxi, he inspected China's first revolutionary base, Jinggangshan. He paid tribute to the former residences and revolutionary sites of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries in Jinggangshan and laid a wreath at the Martyrs' Cemetery for the fallen Red Army martyrs of Jinggangshan.

Jiang Zemin said, during the revolutionary war years, the people of Jiangxi made tremendous sacrifices and significant contributions to the cause of the Chinese revolution. The province alone has 250,000 known martyrs. Many outstanding cadres of our party and state were born on this land. Although the old revolutionary areas of Jiangxi are relatively poor, over the past 40 years, as a major grain-producing province, Jiangxi has never stopped supporting the country with grain, whether in good years or in disaster years, contributing greatly to the nation. He said, "I came to Jiangxi this time to convey the concern and greetings of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the people of Jiangxi, and to learn from the glorious revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan."

In the autumn of Jinggangshan, the scenery is lush and green. Jiang Zemin frequently got out of the car along the way to visit many households, carefully inquiring about the lives of the people in the old revolutionary areas, asking about their well-being. In Shuchuan County's Shankou Village, he visited the home of farmer Li Xianpei. When he heard that this family of six had been in debt for years but now had an annual net income of over 3,200 yuan, he happily pointed to the plaque on the wall and said to Li Xianpei, "I wish your family prosperity like the words on this plaque, 'Prosperity for a Thousand Generations'!" He walked across the road, down into the rice fields, and shook hands warmly with farmer Li Xianzhang, who was harvesting late-season rice. The General Secretary inquired in detail about Li Xianzhang's family's grain production and encouraged him to strive for increased production and income. At the home of Zou Ruizhang, the son of the former leader of the Old Revolutionary Army, Zou Wenkai, the General Secretary chatted with the villagers of Daping Village. He was very moved and said to the villagers, "The people of Jinggangshan have made great contributions to the revolution, and the people of the whole country will never forget you." The General Secretary also specially visited the relatively poor village of Lianhuaping in Gaolianglou Township, Yongxin County, and visited the homes of He Liangqing, He Yunhui, and He Tianxiang, who were in particular difficulty, and discussed with the provincial, regional, county, township, and village cadres present how to help them get out of poverty and become prosperous.

On October 16, after listening to the work reports from the Ji'an Regional Committee and the Jinggangshan Municipal Committee, Jiang Zemin pointed out that due to the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, our revolutionary bases are in mountainous and border areas, which are generally underdeveloped and poor. In recent years, the construction of the old revolutionary areas has improved, and the basic livelihood problems of most people have been solved, but this is not enough. He said, during the Jinggangshan struggle, the revolutionary forerunners achieved victory through hard work and pioneering spirit. Today, we must also, like in the war years, be self-reliant and innovative, changing from simple relief-style poverty alleviation to new economic development-oriented poverty alleviation, so that the people of the old revolutionary areas can prosper together with the people of the whole country, and the cause of the four modernizations can be realized sooner.

During his inspection in Jiangxi, Jiang Zemin paid special attention to inspecting and understanding the agricultural production situation. He said, seeing that Jiangxi's autumn grain harvest is in sight this year, he is very happy, but the grain problem can never be satisfied. He pointed out that the problem of feeding 1.1 billion people is the biggest problem. To make the people live and work in peace, the first thing is to fill their stomachs. He said, China's population accounts for 22% of the world's total, but the arable land area is only 7% of the world's total. Therefore, we must vigorously develop agriculture and increase arable land. China's industry must take the path of internal development, build fewer new factories to reduce the occupation of arable land. At the same time, we must do everything possible to increase grain yield per acre.

Jiang Zemin paid great attention to the development of township enterprises in the old revolutionary areas. In Shuchuan County, he visited the Banya Duck Factory in Zhutian Township and inquired in detail about the factory's production and business situation.

In the former location of the Hunan-Jiangxi Border Revolutionary Government in Maoping, Ninggang County, Jiang Zemin met 77-year-old old pioneer Zhang Guiting. The General Secretary sat down with him in the hall of the site of the "First Congress" of the Border Party and listened to him talk about the history of the Jinggangshan struggle. Zhang Guiting sang the old folk song "The Song of Mobilizing Troops," which praised land reform and the Red Fourth Army. Jiang Zemin was deeply moved and said to the provincial, regional, and county leaders present, the fire of the Jinggangshan revolution was able to spread across the country and achieve victory because the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries had a firm communist ideal and unyielding belief. Today, in building a socialist modernized strong country with Chinese characteristics, we must also have this ideal and belief, which requires learning from the glorious revolutionary traditions of Jinggangshan. He especially emphasized the need to strengthen traditional education for young people, starting from when they are in kindergarten and nursery, to gradually cultivate in them the communist ideals, morals, and sentiments. Only in this way can the socialist mountains be passed down from generation to generation.

Jiang Zemin also praised Jiangxi's efforts in anti-corruption. He said, Jiangxi has basically stopped the trend of extravagant banquets, improved party discipline, and enhanced the prestige of cadres among the people.

During his stay in Jiangxi, Jiang Zemin listened to the work reports from the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government. He said, in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee is united, has a firm stance, and a clear banner. In terms of party discipline, party building, and anti-corruption, the work has also been effective. Jiangxi is an important agricultural province, and the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government attach great importance to agricultural production, which is very necessary. Jiang Zemin also inspected the suburban village of Shunwai in Nanchang and the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, Jiangxi Camphor Factory, visited the Nanchang August 1st Uprising Memorial Hall, and met with old comrades in Nanchang, Ji'an, and other places. He also specially visited the hospital to see old comrades Fang Zhichun and Zhu Kaicheng.

On October 18, Jiang Zemin concluded his inspection in Jiangxi and returned to Beijing.

Accompanying Jiang Zemin on the inspection were Liu Zhongyi, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission, Chen Yaobang, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Zeng Qinghong, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Yang Yongzhe, Deputy Director of the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas.

    江泽民视察江西革命老区
    号召要像战争年代一样自力更生锐意进取
    实行开发式扶贫让老区人民尽快富裕起来
    新华社南昌10月19日电（记者杨健）“虽然我们今天不再像井冈山斗争时那样，每天吃红米饭、南瓜汤了，但光荣的井冈山革命传统一天也不能忘掉”，这是中共中央总书记江泽民在井冈山视察时反复强调的问题。
    10月13日，江泽民总书记来到江西，在省委书记毛致用、省长吴官正陪同下，视察了中国革命的第一个根据地井冈山，瞻仰了老一辈无产阶级革命家在井冈山的旧居、革命遗址，在烈士陵园为牺牲的井冈山红军烈士敬献了花圈。
    江泽民说，在革命战争年代，江西人民为中国革命事业作出了巨大牺牲和重大贡献，全省仅知道姓名的烈士就有25万人之多，我们党和国家的大批优秀干部诞生在这块土地上。解放后，江西老区虽然较为贫困，但40年来，作为产粮省的江西，不管是丰年，还是灾年，都从未中断过向国家支援粮食，对国家贡献很大。他说：“我这次来江西，是来向江西人民转达党中央、国务院的关怀和慰问的，是来学习井冈山光荣革命传统的。”
    深秋的井冈山，满目苍翠。江泽民同志沿途多次下车，访问了许多农户，他细心了解老区人民的生活，问寒问暖。在遂川县山口村，他来到农民李先陂家，当他听说这个六口之家过去连年负债，如今年纯收入达3200多元时，高兴地指着墙上横匾上的字对李先陂说：“祝你家像这匾上写的一样，‘万载兴隆’！”；他穿过公路，走下稻田，与正在收割晚稻的农民李先樟亲切握手，总书记详细询问了李先樟一家的粮食生产情况，勉励他努力增产增收。在井冈山老暴动队队长邹文楷的儿子邹瑞章家里，总书记与大井村的农民拉起家常，他十分激动地对乡亲们说：“井冈山人民对革命贡献很大，全国人民永远不会忘记你们”。总书记还特意来到较为贫困的永新县高桥楼乡莲花坪村，访问了贺亮清、贺云辉、贺天祥三位特别困难户，并和在座的省、地区、县、乡、村干部一道，共商帮助他们脱贫致富的办法。
    10月16日，在听取了吉安地委和井冈山市委的工作汇报后，江泽民同志指出，由于中国革命的特点所决定，我们的革命根据地在山区、边区，这些地方交通不发达，大多是贫困地区。这些年老区建设有了起色，大部分群众的温饱问题已经解决，但这还不够。他说，井冈山斗争时，革命先辈是靠艰苦奋斗、勇于开拓的精神取得胜利，今天我们也要像战争年代一样，自力更生，锐意进取，改单纯救济式的扶贫为新的经济开发式的扶贫，让老区人民和全国人民一道共同富裕起来，使社会主义四化大业早日实现。
    江泽民总书记在江西视察时，着重视察和了解了农业生产情况。他说，沿途看到江西今年秋粮丰收在望，十分高兴，但粮食问题永远也不能满足。他指出，11亿人的吃饭问题是个最大的问题，要使人民安居乐业，首先肚子要吃饱。他说，我国人口数量占世界的22％，而耕地面积却仅占世界的7％，因此，要大搞农业开发，增加可耕面积；我国工业要走内涵发展的道路，少建新厂，以减少对耕地的征用。同时，一定要千方百计提高粮食亩产。
    江泽民同志十分关心老区乡镇企业的发展。他在遂川县参观了珠田乡板鸭厂，详细询问了厂里的生产和经营情况。
    在当年湘赣边界工农兵政府所在地的宁冈县茅坪，江泽民同志见到了77岁的老少先队员张桂庭。总书记拉他一道在边界党的“一大”会址的大厅里坐下，听他介绍井冈山斗争的历史。张桂庭老人动情地唱起了当年老百姓歌颂土地改革和红四军的客家山谣《调兵歌》。江泽民总书记深有感触地对在座的省、地、县领导说，井冈山革命的星星之火之所以能燃遍全国，走向胜利，就在于老一辈无产阶级革命家坚定的共产主义理想和始终不渝的信念。我们今天建设有中国特色的社会主义现代化强国，也必须具有这种理想和信念，这就需要学习井冈山的光荣革命传统。他特别强调要加强对青少年的传统教育，要从孩子在幼儿园、托儿所时就开始培养，使他们从小起就逐步树立共产主义的理想、道德、情操。这样，社会主义的江山方能一代一代传下去。
    江泽民同志还称赞江西廉政建设的做法。他说，江西基本刹住了吃喝风，使党风有了好转，干部在群众中的威信提高了。
    在江西期间，江泽民同志听取了省委、省政府的工作汇报。他说，在这次制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，江西省委的班子是团结的，是立场坚定、旗帜鲜明的。在抓党风、党的建设、廉政建设方面，工作也是做得有成效的。江西是重要的农业省，省委、省政府重视抓农业生产，这是十分必要的。江泽民同志还视察了南昌郊区的顺外村和江西棉纺印染厂、江西樟脑厂，参观了南昌八一起义纪念馆，亲切会见了在南昌、吉安等地的老同志，并专程到医院看望了老同志方志纯和朱开铨。
    10月18日，江泽民同志结束了在江西的考察，返回北京。
    随同江泽民总书记视察的有国家计委副主任刘中一，农业部副部长陈耀邦，中共中央办公厅副主任曾庆红，国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组副组长杨雍哲。（附图片）
