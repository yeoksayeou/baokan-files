Honorary Chairman Rong Yiren presided over the 10th anniversary celebration of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) today. Nearly a thousand attendees, including Chinese and foreign dignitaries, were present. Among the attendees were Yang Shangkun, Song Ping, Wang Zhen, and other high-ranking officials.

Rong Yiren stated at the celebration: "Without the reform and opening-up policy, there would be no CITIC." He further noted that Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary, reaffirmed the continuation of the policy of economic restructuring and reform and opening-up during the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. CITIC will continue to play a role as a window for China's opening to the outside world from this new starting point.

Ten years ago, this company started with just a few dozen employees. Today, it has grown into a multifunctional, international socialist enterprise group engaged in production, technology, finance, trade, and services. CITIC now has 23 direct subsidiaries (banks) and nearly 300 investment enterprises both domestically and internationally. The number of employees has grown to over 1,000. The registered capital has increased from 200 million to 3 billion yuan. The total assets exceed 20 billion yuan. Over the past decade, CITIC has adhered to socialist principles, operated in accordance with economic laws, and adopted and learned from certain internationally accepted practices. It has continuously innovated and gained a certain reputation both domestically and internationally.

Leading officials from the Party and the state, including Yang Shangkun, Song Ping, Wang Zhen, Tian Jiyun, Li Tieying, Zhang Jinfu, Xi Zhongxun, Peng Chong, Chen Muhua, Wang Bingqian, and Zhou Jiaxuan, attended the celebration. Representatives from the domestic and international economic cooperation seminars organized by CITIC, financial and business representatives from various countries stationed in Beijing, and heads of relevant departments and regions in China were also invited to attend.
