The Tengwang Pavilion, which stands majestically on the banks of the Gan River in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, was officially completed today.

The Tengwang Pavilion, along with the Yellow Crane Tower and Yueyang Tower, is one of the three famous towers in Jiangnan. It gained everlasting fame through the essay "Tengwang Pavilion" written by the Tang Dynasty scholar Wang Bo. It was destroyed in the fires of war in 1926.

The rebuilt Tengwang Pavilion is located at the confluence of the Gan River and the Fu River. The main structure has nine stories, with a height of 57.5 meters and a total floor area of 13,000 square meters.

The interior decorations of the new pavilion are harmoniously integrated with the architecture. The couplet above the main entrance, "The setting sun and the lone wild goose fly together, the autumn water blends with the vast sky," was personally inscribed by Chairman Mao Zedong, making it a precious treasure.

    滕王阁重立赣江边军  阀焚毁六十余载
    本报南昌十月四日电　记者赵相如报道：雄踞江西省南昌市赣江之滨的滕王阁，今日正式落成。
    滕王阁与黄鹤楼、岳阳楼并称江南三大名楼，因唐朝文学家王勃所作《滕王阁序》而名传千古，一九二六年终毁于兵燹。
    重建的滕王阁，坐落在赣江与抚河汇合处。主体建筑共九层，净高五十七点五米，建筑面积达一点三万平方米。
    新阁内部陈设与建筑形成一个艺术整体，正门巨联“落霞与孤鹜齐飞，秋水共长天一色”，为毛泽东主席生前手书，十分珍贵。
