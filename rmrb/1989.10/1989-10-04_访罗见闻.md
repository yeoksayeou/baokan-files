After returning from a visit to the fraternal country of Romania, many comrades, out of concern for a friendly nation, have inquired extensively, hoping we could share our observations and experiences. Indeed, during our ten-day visit, our footsteps covered the vast cities and countryside of this heroic nation, leaving us with deep and beautiful impressions.

45 Years of Leaps and Bounds

On August 23, our delegation from the People's Daily was invited to attend the military parade and mass rally in the capital, Bucharest. From 8:30 AM to 11:45 AM, over three hours, we were continually immersed in excitement and emotion as we witnessed the magnificent spectacle of hundreds of thousands of people. Thanks to the arrangements by the Romanian Communist Party's official newspaper, *Scînteia*, we not only shared in the joy of the Romanian people's national holiday but also had the opportunity to gain a general understanding of their tremendous achievements in socialist construction over the past 45 years.

Forty-five years ago, Romania was under the reactionary rule of Ion Antonescu, subservient to Nazi Germany. At that time, Romania was known as the "poorest corner of Europe." The famous Romanian poet Eminescu lamented in one of his poems that his fellow countrymen were the "poor people of a poor country." Under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, on the afternoon of August 23, 1944, the first shots of the armed uprising were fired in Bucharest, overthrowing the reactionary rule of Ion Antonescu and turning a new page in Romanian history. Over the past 45 years, the Romanian people, with their spirit of hard work and self-reliance, have independently developed their national economy, bringing about tremendous changes. Before liberation, Romania produced its own oil but imported gasoline; it produced timber but imported furniture. After liberation, Romania gradually established an independent industrial system. From the slogans and models in the mass celebration parade, we saw several figures that clearly illustrate their achievements: over the past 45 years, industrial output has increased by 134 times, agricultural production by 10 times, and national income by 39 times!

Another achievement that the Romanian comrades take pride in is that Romania announced in March of this year that it had paid off all its foreign debts. In Bucharest, the Director of the Comprehensive Department of the State Planning Commission, Comrade Miledaru, emphasized when discussing this matter that: first, our determination to repay foreign debts has the support of the entire nation; second, our policy of developing economic cooperation with all countries, especially socialist countries, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit remains unchanged; third, we have a solid economic foundation, developed industry and agriculture, which provide us with the possibility of appropriate exports. The money for repaying the debts, 80% of which comes from exporting industrial products, and then agricultural products. They have made great efforts to improve the technological level of foreign exchange-earning sectors and enterprises, develop foreign exchange-earning products, and enhance the competitiveness of these products in the international market. Due to the implementation of these series of policy measures, since 1981, the trade surplus has been increasing year by year, and finally, in March of this year, the entire debt was repaid one year ahead of schedule.

When talking about impressions from the visit to Romania, one cannot help but mention the "Dacia" compact car. On the morning of the 45th anniversary celebration, around 8:10 AM, we arrived at the reviewing stand not long after, and the loudspeaker announced a command, and all the spectators focused their attention on a wide road below the reviewing stand. "Ceausescu is coming!" The message was passed through glances. In less than a minute, several "Dacias" slowly drove in from the west side of the road. As soon as they stopped, Comrade Ceausescu got out of a deep blue "Dacia," accepted flowers from the Young Pioneers, and the reviewing stand erupted in cheers. Watching the "Dacia" speeding away, one couldn't help but think of the "Dacias" we rode in during our visit and saw everywhere along the way. Compared to "Mercedes-Benz" and "Crown," the "Dacia" is indeed less luxurious, and taller individuals could barely stretch their legs inside. However, Romanian comrades have a different evaluation of the "Dacia": it is small, light, fast, fuel-efficient, and most importantly, it is domestically produced, with a low price of over 80,000 lei, which ordinary people can afford after saving for two or three years, or by installment payments. Of course, the "Dacia" also went through a process of occupying the domestic market. Initially, Romania cooperated with the French "Renault" car factory to produce cars, gradually digesting and absorbing advanced technology. Now, domestically produced parts account for 99.7%, with an annual production capacity of about 150,000 vehicles. In addition to domestic sales, it is also exported to over 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. It is easy to understand why Romanian comrades always talk about their "Dacia" with such pride.

The Charm of Life

There are a few figures that are particularly noteworthy: Romania's total grain production has exceeded 30 million tons, almost one ton per person. The problem of food has long been solved. Since 1944, the country has built a total of 6 million new houses, and now 82% of Romanians have moved into new homes, with urban residents having an average living space of 12 square meters per person. Since 1985, the actual remuneration of workers has increased by an average of 10%, retirement pensions have increased by 8%, with low-pension recipients increasing by 40%, while the price index has increased by less than 1% in the same period. The dressing style of Romanian people is also very distinctive, with a style that can be described as "diverse styles, rich colors, harmonious proportions, elegant and dignified." Urban and rural transportation is extensive. More than 30% of the capital's residents own their own cars, and many farmers also have their beloved "Dacias." During holidays, many people use "Dacias" to pull their families and tents, food to the suburbs for vacations and rest. In the suburbs of the capital, on the Black Sea coast in Constanta, in the Danube Delta, and in the tourist resort of Brașov, we saw various tents set up by the forest and green spaces. Men and women, either fishing, swimming, playing ball, or even doing nothing, lying on the grass to sunbathe. It is truly leisurely and harmonious!

It is worth mentioning that Romania's residential construction and housing allocation system. They do not have each unit building their own dormitories but rather have the state plan and implement a system where the state allocates funds and assists individuals in building their own houses. After the state-funded houses are built, they are allocated by government agencies according to certain policies. This avoids the "housing wars" within units and ensures the housing rights of every worker. It is said that this method is quite effective, as it saves the trouble of housing allocation and requests from government agencies, enterprises, and public institutions.

A Friendship with Deep Roots

To what extent do Romanians understand China? This question is quite interesting. To illustrate the point, we must give a few examples. When we visited the ancient city of Brașov in central Romania, we toured the first school established in 1399 that taught in the Romanian national language. The responsible comrade of the museum showed us a book titled "World Geography" printed and published by the school in 1814 and said that the author, Nicolae, had been to China during the Kangxi era. He used 66 pages to introduce the Great Wall of China, Confucius, and the four great inventions: papermaking, gunpowder, the compass, and movable type printing. He even gave detailed descriptions of how Chinese people write with brushes and eat with chopsticks.

On the evening of August 21, we had dinner at the "White Horse Restaurant" in Nevo, on the Black Sea coast. When the musicians and singers on stage performed famous songs from various countries, they noticed Chinese guests among the nearly thousand customers and immediately played a Chinese song, "The Ballad of Mulan." We couldn't help but stand up and clap along with them. Our two translators, Banetiscu Vasile and Lu Ming, were students in China in the 1950s, and their Mandarin Chinese is even more standard than ours!

In the past ten years, Comrade Saralegan, the secretary of *Scînteia*, has published a book about China every time he visits China. Now, he has four beautifully bound books about China displayed in his home. He said he will continue to write more.

Romanian comrades are not only familiar with the names of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping but also have a deep understanding of our General Secretary Jiang Zemin. They said that after the Bucharest earthquake on March 4, 1977, Comrade Jiang Zemin led a Chinese expert team to work in Romania for over a year, covering more than 20 cities. The sweat he shed for Sino-Romanian friendship also nurtured the friendship between our two peoples. (Accompanying photo)

The completion of the Black Sea-Danube Canal within the territory of Constanta County, Romania, has shortened the navigation distance of this section by about 400 kilometers, bringing better economic benefits. The photo shows the main control gate of the canal. By July of this year, more than 2,000 ships had passed through here.

专栏：出访归来

    访罗见闻
    本报记者　保育钧
    从兄弟的罗马尼亚访问归来，不少同志出于对友好国家的关心，多方询问，希望我们介绍所见所闻所感。的确，十多天的访问，我们的足迹遍及这个英雄国度的广大城乡，留下了深刻、美好的印象。
    45年的飞跃
    那是8月23日，我们人民日报代表团应邀参加了首都布加勒斯特阅兵和群众游行的观礼活动。从上午8点30分到11点45分，三个多小时，面对极为壮观的数十万群众场面，我们始终沉浸在兴奋和激动之中。感谢罗共中央机关报《火花报》的安排，我们不仅分享了英雄的罗马尼亚人民节日的欢乐，而且借此机会概括地了解到他们45年来在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。
    45年前，罗马尼亚在扬·安东内斯库反动政权统治之下，从属于法西斯德国。那时的罗马尼亚被称为
  “欧洲最穷困的角落”，罗马尼亚著名诗人爱明奈斯库在他的一首诗中哀叹自己的同胞是“穷国的穷人”。在罗马尼亚共产党领导下，1944年8月23日下午，布加勒斯特打响了武装起义的第一枪，推翻了扬·安东内斯库反动统治，揭开了罗马尼亚历史上新的一页。45年来，罗马尼亚人民发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神，独立自主地发展民族经济，使国家发生了翻天覆地的变化。解放前，罗马尼亚自己生产原油，却进口汽油；出产木材，却进口家具。解放后，罗马尼亚逐步建立了独立的工业体系。从群众庆祝游行的标语和模型中，我们看到这样几个很能说明成就的数字：45年来，工业产值增长134倍，农业生产增长10倍，国民收入增长39倍！
    同样使罗马尼亚同志引为自豪的一个成就是，罗马尼亚今年3月宣布还清了全部外债。在布加勒斯特，国家计委综合司司长米列达鲁同志在同我们谈到这件事时强调说，第一，我们还外债的决心得到全国人民的拥护；第二，我们在平等互利基础上同世界各国、特别是社会主义国家发展经济合作的政策不变；第三，我们拥有雄厚的经济基础、发达的工业和农业，这为我们提供了适量出口的可能性。还债的钱，80％是依靠出口工业品，其次才是农产品。他们下大力量提高创汇部门和创汇企业的技术水平，发展创汇产品，提高这些产品在国际市场的竞争能力。由于采取了这一系列政策措施，从1981年以来，外贸顺差逐年增加，终于在今年3月比预定计划提前一年还清了全部债务。
    谈到访罗观感，不能不谈谈罗马尼亚的“达契亚”小轿车。庆祝45周年国庆那天上午8点10分左右，我们来到观礼台不久，喇叭里传来一声口令，观礼的人们全都把视线集中到主席台下一条宽阔的马路上。“齐奥塞斯库来了！”人们用眼神传递着这一信息。不到一分钟，几辆“达契亚”从马路西边缓缓开来，刚刚停稳，齐奥塞斯库同志从一辆深蓝色的“达契亚”里走出来，接受少先队员的献花，观礼台上一片欢腾。目送着疾驰而去的“达契亚”，不禁联想到我们访问期间所乘坐的和沿途到处见到的“达契亚”。比起“奔驰”、“皇冠”来，“达契亚”虽然颇逊豪华劲，个子大一些的人坐在里面勉强可伸腿。但是，罗马尼亚同志对“达契亚”却有另一番评价：它小巧、轻便、快速、省油，更主要的是国产货，价格低廉，8万多列伊便可买一辆，普通人攒二三年就买得起，分期付款也行。当然，“达契亚”占领国内市场也是有个过程的。起初，罗马尼亚与法国“雷诺”汽车厂合作生产，后来逐渐消化吸收先进技术，现在，国产化零部件已达到99.7％，年生产能力约15万辆，内销之外，还向亚、非、拉和欧洲40多个国家出口。不难理解，罗马尼亚同志为什么谈起他们的“达契亚”时总是那么自豪。
    生活的风采
    有几个数字是很引人注意的：罗马尼亚粮食总产已超过3000万吨，几乎人均一吨粮食。“吃”的问题早已解决。从1944年以来，全国累计新建住房600万套，现在82％的罗马尼亚人搬进了新居，城市居民人均居住面积12平方米。1985年以来，劳动人民的实际报酬平均增加10％，退休金增加了8％，其中低退休金者增加了40％，而同期的物价指数增长不足1％。罗马尼亚人的穿着打扮，更是有着鲜明的民族特色，用“风格多样、色彩丰富、比例匀称、雅致大方”来概括并不为过。城乡交通可谓四通八达。首都30％以上的居民有了自己的小汽车，不少农民也有了心爱的“达契亚”。每逢节假日，许多人用“达契亚”拉着一家大小和帐篷、食物，到郊外度假休息。我们在首都郊区，在黑海之滨的康斯坦察，在多瑙河三角洲，在旅游胜地波那亚—布拉索夫，到处都可见到树林边、绿地上支起的各式各样的帐篷。男男女女，或垂钓，或游泳，或打球，有的甚至什么也不干，躺在草地上晒太阳。真可谓悠闲自得，其乐融融！
    值得一提的是罗马尼亚的住宅建设和住房分配制度。他们不是由各单位自行盖宿舍，而是由国家统一规划，实行由国家拨款和国家帮助下私人自建住宅相结合的办法。国家拨款统一建设的住宅建成后，由政府机关按一定的政策统一分配。这就避免了单位内的“分房大战”，保证了每个职工的住房权利。据介绍，一对年轻夫妇结婚，可分到两间一套的住宅，有了孩子后可调到三间、四间一套的；孩子大了离开家庭，或其他缘故减少了人口，要调到面积小一些的住宅，谁不调整，就给谁加房租。据说，这个办法还挺灵，它省却了机关、企事业单位领导和群众分房、要房的许多苦恼。
    友谊源远流长
    罗马尼亚人对中国了解到什么程度？这个问题很有意思。为了说明问题，不得不举几个例子。我们去中部城市布拉索夫古城时，参观了1399年建立的第一座用罗马尼亚民族语言授课的学校，博物馆的负责同志打开1814年该校印刷出版的一本《世界地理》对我们说，这本书的作者尼古拉，在康熙年间到过中国。他用66页的篇幅介绍了中国的长城、孔子，介绍了造纸、火药、指南针、活版印刷等四大发明，甚至连中国人写字用毛笔，吃饭用筷子也有详尽的描述。
    8月21日晚，我们在黑海之滨涅夫托的“白马餐厅”用餐，舞台上的乐师和歌手在演奏各国名曲时，从近千名顾客中发现有中国客人，立即演奏了一曲中国的《孟姜女》，乐得我们情不自禁地站起来为他们打拍子。我们的两位翻译班乃依提斯库·瓦西里和罗明同志，是50年代的留华学生，他们的汉语普通话讲得比我们还标准！
    最近十年来，《火花报》秘书长沙拉让同志每访问一次中国，就出一本关于中国的书，现在他家里已陈列了四本有关中国的精装本了。他表示还要继续写下去。
    罗马尼亚同志不仅对毛泽东、周恩来、邓小平等名字很熟悉，而且对我们的总书记江泽民同志的了解，不亚于中国一些同志。他们说，在1977年3月4日布加勒斯特大地震后，江泽民同志率领中国专家组在罗马尼亚工作了一年多，足迹遍及罗马尼亚20多座城市。他为中罗友谊洒下的汗水，也浇灌了我们两国人民的友谊之花。（附图片）
    罗马尼亚康斯坦察县境内的黑海—多瑙河运河的建成，使该地段的航程比原来缩短约400公里，从而带来了较好的经济效益。图为运河的总控制闸。今年1—7月已有2000多只船从这里通过。　本报记者
