According to a report by the local *Huaqiao Daily* on the 21st, three active participants in the Beijing turmoil who fled to Europe recently "arrived in Taipei via relevant channels," and will "continue to fight for freedom and democracy in mainland China" while in Taiwan.

The report states that the three individuals who fled abroad are Tian Xinran (male) and Jing Jing and Bai Xue (both female). Their residence in Taiwan was arranged by the notorious anti-communist spy organization, the "China Mainland Refugee Relief Association."

Taiwan is currently recruiting planners, organizers, and active participants of the Beijing turmoil who have fled abroad to engage in anti-communist activities on the island. According to this newspaper, Taiwan's "Minister of the Interior" Zhang Longcheng claimed that Taiwan has approved the residency of 10 "mainland democracy activists stranded in the Hong Kong region," including Yang Yang, a member of the Beijing swimming team who was recently allowed by the British authorities in Hong Kong to travel to the United States. Among them, three have already been recruited to Taiwan.

　　三名叛逃欧洲的北京动乱积极参加者跑到台湾
    新华社香港10月22日电　据此间《华侨日报》21日报道，3名叛逃到欧洲的北京动乱的积极参加者最近“经由有关管道，由欧洲飞抵台北”，将在台湾“继续为大陆争自由民主而奋斗”。
    据报道，这3名叛国外逃分子是田欣然（男）和荆晶、白雪（均为女性）。他们到台湾居留是由臭名昭著的反共特务机构“中国大陆灾胞救济总会”“安排”的。
    台湾正收罗叛逃在外的北京动乱的策划者、组织者和积极参加者到台进行反共活动。据这家报纸报道，台湾“内政部次长”张隆盛声称，台湾已核准包括前些时经香港英国当局准许由香港到达美国的北京游泳队队员杨洋在内的10名“滞留港九地区的大陆民运人士”到台湾居留，其中3人已被收罗到台湾。
