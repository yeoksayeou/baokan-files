In the early morning of September 22, I learned from a Japanese radio broadcast that Mr. Okazaki Kaitaro had passed away at 2 a.m. I couldn't believe it; it was too sudden.

Because I had already received a notice to attend a banquet hosted by Vice Chairman Wang Zhen for Mr. Okazaki on September 28. He was to participate in the activities commemorating the 40th anniversary of our national day and to attend the economic discussion meeting held by the China International Trust and Investment Corporation to celebrate its 10th anniversary. In a few days, we were to meet in Beijing. This news was a great shock to me, and I felt immense grief.

We must never forget those who dug the wells. Whenever people mention Japanese friends who have made significant contributions to Sino-Japanese friendship, whether in China or Japan, they will first think of Mr. Okazaki. I first met Mr. Okazaki in 1955. That April and May, Lei Renmin, accompanied by the Chinese trade delegation, visited Japan to negotiate the third Sino-Japanese private trade agreement. During their stay in Tokyo, he came to the hotel to meet with Lei, the delegation leader. I was the liaison and was present throughout the meeting. Since then, over the long years, as Sino-Japanese relations have undergone many twists and turns, my friendship with Mr. Okazaki has only deepened. I know that Mr. Okazaki regards the development of Sino-Japanese friendship as a lifelong political belief. He often emphasized that without China's development, there would be no prosperity for Japan; from a long-term perspective, Japan would find it difficult to survive without China. Without Sino-Japanese friendship, it would be difficult to maintain peace and stability in Asia and the Pacific region. For decades, the Japanese authorities have always regarded the Japan-U.S. relationship as the "axis" of Japanese diplomacy, while Mr. Okazaki has always advocated that Sino-Japanese relations should be given the top priority in Japanese diplomacy. Mr. Okazaki often gave lectures in various parts of Japan, always saying that Japan had caused such deep suffering to China in the past, while China had taken a magnanimous attitude towards Japan and waived the right to demand reparations from Japan at the time of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Therefore, Japan should do its utmost to assist China's construction.

Mr. Okazaki's most outstanding contribution to Sino-Japanese friendship was in the early 1960s when he, along with a few old friends such as Matsumura Kenzo, Takasaki Tatsunosuke, and Ishibashi Tanzan, pushed Sino-Japanese relations from private exchanges to a new semi-official stage. Both sides established semi-official resident institutions and exchanged resident reporters. In the autumn of 1962, after Matsumura and his entourage came to Beijing and reached an agreement with Premier Zhou Enlai on several major principles for developing Sino-Japanese relations in an accumulative manner, Takasaki led a large economic delegation to Beijing. Mr. Okazaki was one of the main members of the delegation. On November 9, Comrade Liao Chengzhi and Takasaki Tatsunosuke signed the "Memorandum on Long-Term Comprehensive Trade between China and Japan," marking the birth of the famous memorandum trade between the two countries for a period of time and the establishment of a new channel of communication between the two governments. The political liaison persons designated by both sides were Liao Chengzhi and Matsumura Kenzo, and the economic liaison persons were Liao Chengzhi, Liu Xifeng and Takasaki Tatsunosuke, Okazaki Kaitaro. With the passage of time and the development and changes in the situation, Mr. Okazaki and Mr. Furui Yoshizumi became the Japanese side's responsible persons for this channel.

Mr. Okazaki had long hoped for the early establishment of an air bridge between China and Japan and was dissatisfied with the fact that Sino-Japanese exchanges had to go through Hong Kong. In order to be able to come directly from Japan to China, in April 1964, Matsumura, Okazaki, Furui and others chartered the Japanese cargo ship "Genkai Maru" from the Japanese port of Moji to Qinhuangdao. Both sides signed a memorandum on the establishment of trade offices and the exchange of resident reporters in Beijing. In the summer and autumn of the same year, the "Liao Chengzhi Office Liaison Office in Tokyo" and the "Takasaki Office Liaison Office in Beijing" were established one after the other, with both sides having eight or nine reporters stationed in the other's capital. From then on, both sides had semi-official permanent institutions and resident reporters in each other's countries. Sino-Japanese relations took a new step, and people standing on this step could see a glimmer of dawn for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations in the future. Although Sino-Japanese relations encountered various unforeseen difficulties afterward, Mr. Okazaki, in order to break through the difficulties, led delegations to Beijing every year to hold annual negotiations on memorandum trade, gradually ushering in a new situation of Sino-Japanese friendship. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, the Japanese side's memorandum trade office completed its mission, and the Japan-China Economic Association was newly established. Mr. Okazaki has been serving as the permanent advisor to the association ever since. In the process of the development and evolution of Sino-Japanese friendship over the past thirty years, Mr. Okazaki's footprints can be found everywhere. Mr. Okazaki is undoubtedly a witness to the history of post-war Sino-Japanese relations.

I was one of the main members of the Chinese side directly involved in the memorandum trade work. I often say that Mr. Okazaki was my guarantor during my time working in Japan, and this is true. Shortly after the signing of the memorandum in April 1964, I was appointed as the chief representative of the Chinese side's office in Tokyo and encountered obstacles in obtaining an entry visa. The Japanese authorities proposed conditions, requiring Sun Pinghua to guarantee that he would not engage in political activities in Japan. Our side, of course, insisted on principles and refused to make such an unreasonable guarantee. After several rounds of negotiations over several months, the issue was finally resolved. It was later learned that Mr. Okazaki had secretly given a written guarantee to the Japanese government. During my three years of work in Japan, Mr. Okazaki never raised any objections to my normal activities, and on the contrary, he sometimes invited me to attend seminars and asked me to speak on Sino-Japanese relations. In fact, Mr. Okazaki was protecting my normal political activities in Japan. It is also amusing to say that before the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, the mutual establishment of resident institutions and the exchange of reporters by both sides were themselves the biggest political activities. Therefore, Mr. Okazaki fully understood how to deal with this issue.

A few days ago, Chairman Deng Xiaoping met with the delegation led by Ito Seigi and said: "No matter what changes occur in Japan or in China, Sino-Japanese friendship should not change and will not change." I feel that this expresses the voice of the people of both China and Japan. I believe that Mr. Okazaki must have had the same belief. It is for this reason that Mr. Okazaki decided, at this time, to visit China on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, despite his advanced age. We were waiting for his arrival and looking forward to his new contributions to promoting a new situation in Sino-Japanese relations. Who would have thought that in one night, he would silently bid us farewell forever.

His passing is an irreparable loss to Sino-Japanese friendship, and the thought of this is heartbreaking. But I believe that the people of China and Japan will never forget Mr. Okazaki, and the name Okazaki Kaitaro will forever be a driving force for Sino-Japanese friendship.

    痛悼冈崎嘉平太先生
    中日友好协会会长　孙平化
    9月22日早晨，得知日本电台广播了冈崎嘉平太老先生凌晨二时不幸逝世的消息，我真不敢相信，这实在太突然了。
    因为我早就接到出席9月28日王震副主席宴请冈崎先生的通知，他要参加我国庆四十周年的纪念活动，还要出席中国国际信托投资公司为纪念创业十周年举行的经济讨论会，再过几天就要在北京见面了。这对我的打击太大了，我感到万分悲痛。
    饮水不忘掘井人。一提到为日中友好做出重大贡献的尚健在的日本老朋友，不管在中国还是在日本，人们首先会想到冈崎先生的大名。我是1955年首次见到冈崎先生的。那年四、五月份，为谈判第三次中日民间贸易协定，雷任民同志率中国贸易代表团访问日本，在东京期间他来旅馆会见雷团长。我是联系人，会见时一直在座。从那以后，在漫长的岁月里，中日关系风云变幻、几经波折，我同冈崎先生的友谊却是与日俱增。我深知冈崎先生把发展日中友好当做自己一生的政治信念。他经常强调，没有中国的发展，就没有日本的繁荣，从长远观点看，日本离开了中国将难以生存；没有日中友好，将难以维护亚洲及太平洋地区的和平与稳定。数十年来，日本当局一直把日美关系作为日本外交的“基轴”，而冈崎先生则一直主张应把日中关系放在日本外交的首要地位。冈崎先生经常应邀到日本国内各地讲演，他总是说日本过去给中国造成那样深重的灾难，而中国对日本则持宽大态度，在中日建交时主动放弃了向日本索取赔偿的权力，因此日本更应该全力以赴地协助中国建设。
    冈崎先生在中日友好事业中最突出的贡献是60年代初，他和松村谦三、高崎达之助、石桥湛三等几位老朋友一起，把中日关系由民间来往推到半官半民的新阶段，双方互设了形式是民间、实质是官方的常驻机构，互派了常驻记者。1962年深秋，松村先生一行来北京同周恩来总理谈定了以积累方式发展中日关系的几项主要原则之后，高崎先生又率大型经济代表团抵达北京，冈崎先生就是代表团主要成员之一。11月9日廖承志同志与高崎达之助先生签署了“中日长期综合贸易备忘录”，一个时期中日间颇为有名的备忘录贸易从此诞生，建立了通向双方政府的新的民间渠道。双方各自指定政治方面的联系人为廖承志—松村谦三，经济方面的联系人为廖承志、刘希文—高崎达之助、冈崎嘉平太。随着时间的推移和形势的发展与演变，冈崎先生和古井喜实先生成为这条渠道的日方负责人。
    冈崎先生一直盼望中日间尽早架起空中桥梁，他对中日间交往绕道香港很有意见。为了能从日本直接来中国，1964年4月，松村、冈崎、古井等一行特包乘日本客货轮“玄海丸”从日本门司港直航秦皇岛，双方在北京签署了关于互设贸易办事处和交换常驻记者的备忘录。同年夏秋，“廖承志办事处驻东京联络处”和“高崎办事处驻北京联络处”先后设立，双方各有八、九名记者常驻对方首都，从此中日间各自在对方国家有了半官方的常设机构和常驻记者。中日关系上了一个新的台阶，人们站在这个台阶上可以望到未来中日关系正常化的一线曙光。虽然此后中日关系又遇上了料想不到的种种困难，但冈崎先生为了突破难关，年年率团来北京举行备忘录贸易定期的年度谈判，逐渐迎来了中日友好的新形势。中日建交后，日方备忘录贸易办事处完成了它的使命，新成立了日中经济协会，冈崎先生至今一直担任协会的常任顾问。三十多年中日友好发展演变的进程中留下了冈崎先生的许多足迹，冈崎先生是当之无愧的战后中日关系史的见证人。
    我是直接参与备忘录贸易工作的中方主要成员之一，我常说，冈崎先生是我在日本工作时期的保证人，这是真的。1964年4月，备忘录签署后不久，我被任命为中方驻东京办事处的首席代表，在入境签证上遇到了障碍，日本官方提出条件，要求孙平化保证在日本不搞政治活动。我方当然坚持原则，不同意做这种没有道理的保证，后来，几经交涉，历时数月，终于获得解决。事后了解，冈崎先生暗地里向日本政府作了书面保证。我在日本工作3年，冈崎先生从来未对我进行的正常活动提出过任何不同意见，相反，有时他还邀我一起出席座谈会，要我就中日关系发表意见。实际上冈崎先生是保护我在日本进行正常的政治活动。说来也好笑，中日建交前双方互设常驻机构、交换记者本身，不就是最大的政治吗？因此，冈崎先生完全明白应该如何对待这个问题。
    前几天，邓小平主席会见伊东正义一行时说：不管日本国内发生什么变化，也不管中国国内发生什么变化，中日友好不应该变，也不会变。我觉得这正说出了中日两国人民的心声。我相信冈崎先生一定也会抱有同样的信念。正因为如此，冈崎先生才决定在当前这个时机，于中国国庆四十周年前夕，不辞高龄前来访问。我们正在等待他的到来，期待他能为推动中日关系展现出新的局面作出新的贡献。谁曾想，一夜之间，他竟默默地同我们永远告别。
    他的去世使中日友好遭到了无法弥补的损失，想到此，真令人心碎。但我相信，中日两国人民都永远不会忘记冈崎先生，冈崎嘉平太这个名字将永远成为中日友好的推动力量。
