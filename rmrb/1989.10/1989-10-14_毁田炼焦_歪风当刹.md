    Destroying Fields to Produce Coke: A Harmful Trend That Must Be Stopped

    Industrial coking coal is in short supply, and prices are soaring. Producing coke is profitable, so many farmers in Lianyuan City, which is rich in bituminous coal, have built numerous small-scale coke ovens in the fields along the Lou (Di) Lian (Yuan) Highway (each coke oven occupies about one to two tenths of an acre). Within a 10-kilometer stretch from Doulianshan Town to Zushi Temple, there are 42 coke ovens built in the fields. This trend is worsening, and the number of unlicensed small coal mines has reached the hundreds in recent years. This primitive method of coke production not only destroys fertile fields but also wastes national resources and pollutes the environment. This issue should be given serious attention by the relevant departments.

    毁田炼焦  歪风当刹
    工业焦煤紧缺，价格猛涨，炼焦有利可图，盛产烟煤的涟源市很多农民便在娄（底）涟（源）公路两旁的良田中大量建造土炼焦炉（一座焦炉占田一二分）。仅从斗笠山镇到祖师殿不到10公里的地段内，建在良田中的炼焦炉就达42座。且有愈演愈烈之势，至于无证开采的小煤窑，近年来数以百计。这种土法炼焦，不仅毁坏了良田，而且浪费了国家能源，污染了环境，应引起有关部门重视。
