The United States has decided to continue producing chemical weapons. Our reporter Zhang Qixun reported from Washington on October 9th: According to today's Washington Post, the Bush administration has made a decision that even if various countries reach a chemical weapons prohibition treaty and it comes into effect, the United States will continue to produce modernized chemical weapons.

Bush made this decision before his speech to the United Nations on September 25th, in which he proposed a significant reduction in chemical weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union but did not mention stopping the production of chemical weapons. The Washington Post said that Bush's decision reflects a view from the Pentagon that, to guard against the possibility that the chemical weapons prohibition treaty may not be fully implemented, the United States needs to maintain its plan to produce modernized "binary" chemical weapons. Experts on chemical weapons at the Brookings Institution here, such as Harris, and other analysts believe that the United States' continued production of chemical weapons will be an unstable factor, inevitably prompting other countries to follow the United States' example and develop chemical weapons, thus failing to achieve the goal of prohibiting chemical weapons.

    美国决定继续生产化学武器
    本报华盛顿10月9日电　记者张启昕报道：据《华盛顿邮报》今天透露，布什政府已作出决定，即便各国达成一项禁止化学武器条约并开始生效，美国仍将继续生产现代化的化学武器。
    布什的这一决定是在他9月25日向联大发表讲话前作出的，他在讲话中曾提出美苏大幅度削减化学武器的建议，但未提及停止生产化学武器。《华盛顿邮报》称，布什的决定反映了美国五角大楼的一种主张，即为提防禁化条约不能全部实施，美国需要维持其生产现代化的“二元”化学武器的计划。此间布鲁金斯研究所的化学武器专家哈里斯和其他一些分析家认为，美国继续生产化学武器将是一个不稳定因素，势必刺激其他国家效法美国，发展化学武器，因而达不到禁止化学武器的目的。
