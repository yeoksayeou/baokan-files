The 1989 Great Wall - Xianjing Cup Cycling Race concluded today in Beijing. The 20-year-old national team member Tang Xuezhong won the championship in the 90-kilometer final with a time of 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 45.40 seconds. Another national team member, Wu Weiping, took the second place.

The competition held preliminary rounds in Beijing, Harbin, Dalian, Shanghai, Jinan, Tianjin, and Taiyuan. The top six from each region, along with strong players from the national team, Gansu team, Ningxia team, and Yunnan team, participated in today's final.

This is the first time China has held a road cycling race using the short-distance lap method. A sprint prize was set every four laps, increasing the difficulty and intensity of the competition. This change has altered the previous situation where riders often avoided leading in the middle of the race, only to compete at the finish line, failing to truly showcase their skills.

　　我国首次举行公路绕圈自行车赛
    本报北京10月22日讯　记者江正茂、汪大昭报道：1989年长城——鲜京杯自行车赛，今天在北京落下战幕。20岁的国家队选手汤学忠在90公里的决赛中，以2小时07分45秒40的成绩夺得冠军。国家队另一选手邬伟培获亚军。
    这次比赛先后在北京、哈尔滨、大连、上海、济南、天津和太原举行了预赛。各赛区前6名和国家队、甘肃队、宁夏队、云南队的强手一起参加今天的决赛。
    这是我国首次采用短距离绕圈方式进行的公路自行车赛，每四圈还设立冲刺奖，增加了比赛的难度和争夺的激烈程度，改变了过去那种在公路自行车赛中常见的途中避免领先、只求终点见分晓、不能真正赛出水平的局面。
