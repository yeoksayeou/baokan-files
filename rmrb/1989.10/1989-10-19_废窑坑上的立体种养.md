When the news that young farmer Sun Cunzhong had created a production value of 450,000 yuan and a profit of 320,000 yuan in just two years spread, many people were astonished: Was it merely because he had taken over 300 acres of abandoned brick kiln sites?

Yes, it was. Although Miaozhuang Village in Jiunv Township, Chengwu County, Shandong Province, has only one acre of arable land per person, the 300 acres of brick kiln sites formed by the extraction of soil for brick-making have been abandoned for many years and were not utilized by anyone. Young farmer Sun Cunzhong was thinking about this and pondering over it. In April 1986, he decisively signed a contract with the township to take over the 300 acres of abandoned brick kiln sites.

How could the abandoned brick kiln sites generate such a large economic benefit? The key lies in Sun Cunzhong's implementation of fish-rice-forest interplanting, creating a small vertical ecological farming system.

Sun Cunzhong first excavated sixteen fish ponds of similar size, forming 160 acres of water surface for fish farming. Along the ponds, he planted 2,500 paulownia trees. He also used the soil from the ponds to create 130 acres of farmland, of which 100 acres were planted with apple trees, and sweet potatoes were interplanted between the trees.

To increase the utilization rate of the water surface, Sun Cunzhong adopted a method of mixed aquaculture. Based on the living habits, growth rates, and market conditions of different fish species, he mainly raised carp, with grass carp, crucian carp, bighead carp, and tilapia as supplementary species.

Within Sun Cunzhong's farming system, a beneficial cycle has been initially formed: using pond soil to create farmland for planting sweet potatoes, using sweet potatoes and vines to raise pigs and cattle, using pig and cattle manure to fertilize the ponds, and using the pond sediment to fertilize the fields. This cycle reduces costs and increases returns.

Sun Cunzhong's comprehensive development and vertical farming have inspired his neighbors and even attracted foreign experts. Last October, agricultural experts from India and Nepal came to visit and all agreed that this is a good approach to agricultural comprehensive development.

    废窑坑上的立体种养
    汝湘  正存  亚光
    当青年农民孙存忠两年创产值四十五万元、获利三十二万元的消息传出后，很多人感到惊讶：仅仅是因为他承包了三百亩废弃多年的窑坑吗？
    是的。山东省成武县九女乡苗庄村虽然人均仅一亩耕地，但因烧窑取土而形成的三百亩窑坑却废弃多年，无人利用。青年农民孙存忠心里惦记着，脑子里思索着。一九八六年四月，他果断地同乡里签订了承包三百亩废窑坑的合同。
    废窑坑怎能产生这么大的经济效益？关键在于孙存忠实行了渔粮林间作，造成了一个小小的立体生态种养体系。
    孙存忠首先开挖了十六个大小相近的鱼塘，形成一百六十亩水面，用以养鱼；沿塘又植桐树二千五百棵；还用挖塘的土造田一百三十亩，其中一百亩栽苹果树，树间又套种红薯。
    为了提高单位水体的利用率，孙存忠采取多种混合养殖的办法，根据不同鱼种的生活习性、生长速度和市场行情，以鲢为主，草、鲫、鲤、罗非等搭配混养。
    在孙存忠的种养体系内部，初步形成了一种良性循环：用塘土造田栽红薯，用红薯和薯藤养猪、牛，猪、牛粪投入池塘肥水，清塘的鱼粪用来肥田……如此循环，成本降低，收益增加。
    孙存忠的综合开发、立体种养，启发了四邻乡亲，还引来了外国专家。去年十月，印度、尼泊尔等国的农业专家专程前来考察，都认为这是农业综合开发的一条好路子。
