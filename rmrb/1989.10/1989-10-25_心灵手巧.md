Forty-three disabled individuals have not been confined to their homes, nor have they begged on the streets, nor have they pestered organizations or begged from the state. Instead, they have organized themselves just like able-bodied people and have resolutely embarked on the arduous task of starting a business at the county welfare factory.

This county welfare factory, where more than half of the employees are disabled, has been in operation since 1958. It has received only 100,000 yuan in state subsidies and 480,000 yuan in tax exemptions, but it has paid 1.04 million yuan in taxes to the state, provided 1.5 million yuan in support for civilians under public welfare, supported 44 widows and widowers, and cared for 18 orphans. Today, 18 of these orphans have become officials, soldiers, or high-level intellectuals.

The self-raised funds of the Ying Mountain County Welfare Factory have grown from nothing to over 3 million yuan. Between 1979 and August 1989, the factory increased its self-raised funds by 2.11 million yuan over a decade. Currently, the factory has fixed assets worth 7.6 million yuan and offers services such as tea houses, printing, hairdressing, mechanical repairs, machine-made noodles, and catering. The annual business income exceeds 2.4 million yuan, with taxes and profits each reaching over 100,000 yuan.

　　心灵手巧
    四十三名残疾人，没有蜷缩家中，也没有乞讨街头，更没有纠缠组织，伸手国家，而是和健全人一样组织起来，毅然投入县福利厂艰苦创业。
    这家残疾人超半数的县福利厂，自一九五八年建立以来，仅接受国家补贴一万余元、减免税四点八万元，而向国家交税达十点四万元，支付民政供养对象十五万元，扶养鳏寡老人四十四人，孤儿十八人。如今，十八名孤儿有的是干部、军人，有的还是高中级知识分子。
    营山县福利厂自有资金从无到有，现已达三十余万元，其中一九七九年至一九八九年八月，十年间就增加自有资金二十一点一万元。如今固定资产七十六万元，服务项目有茶旅社、印刷、理发、机械修配、机制挂面、饮食等，年营业收入二十四万元以上，创税、利各万余元。
    上图：一等甲级残废军人甘雨茂缺条腿，但手灵巧极了，一张蜡纸他可印六千多份材料。下图：机制挂面社的承包负责人、盲人谢映茂依靠妻子导向引路，给顾客送挂面。
