	Thoughts on Baghdad
	Chen Bolin

	Genuine Friendship

	At the end of September, at the invitation of the Iraqi General Federation of Trade Unions, I went to Baghdad to participate in the international symposium on "The Role of Trade Unions in Promoting Development." Upon arriving at Baghdad International Airport, it was already past midnight. I was busy queuing up to go through customs when I suddenly saw an Australian old lady who I had just met on the plane coming over to greet me:

	"Hey, Mr. Chen, your hosts are already here with nameplates to welcome you. I knew you would receive a 'red carpet' welcome. Look, here it is!"

	She said this so seriously that it made the surrounding passengers laugh, and I felt warm inside. I thought, since the June 4th incident, a small group of people in the West have been vigorously inciting anti-China sentiment and slandering our country. But at this moment, the goodwill shown by this ordinary foreign woman, who I had never met before, was not out of personal flattery, but a natural expression of her friendly feelings towards China and the Chinese people.

	After leaving the airport, the car sped along the smooth, straight highway towards the city center. Along the way, the lights were as bright as day, with lush greenery on both sides and vast palm groves in the distance. The hot wind occasionally swept by, seemingly carrying the scent of the vast desert. The faster the car went, the more lively the host's conversation became, switching between Arabic and English. He repeatedly praised the deep friendship and close cooperation between Iraq and China, highly commending the labor enthusiasm and great contributions of Chinese workers helping to build Iraq. He said that the recent riots in Beijing had made many Iraqi friends worried, but after the Chinese government successfully suppressed the riots, the news spread, and they felt elated. The international anti-China forces tried to make a big deal out of this incident, which was very unpopular. The friendship between Iraq and China is tested and proven. At this point, the driver, who had not spoken yet, seemed particularly excited. His strong, sturdy hands left the steering wheel and raised a thumbs up, then raised a powerful fist, waving it above his head. Although I couldn't understand what he was saying, I was deeply moved by his unrestrained enthusiasm and sincere friendship, and it left a lasting impression on me!

	Civilization and Innovation

	The colorful mosques shimmered under the scorching sun, making the ancient city of Baghdad even more magnificent and beautiful. The uniquely designed and colorful residential areas are scattered in various corners of the city. In the middle of September, the temperature at noon still reached around 40 degrees Celsius. Despite sweating profusely, people still dressed neatly, and even young men rarely wore tank tops and shorts on the street. Whether it was bookstores or high-end hotels frequented by foreign tourists, none sold any pornographic books or obscene audio-visual products.

	On the night before the Islamic Friday rest day, the author encountered three or four pairs of young men and women holding a wedding ceremony on the lawn in front of the hotel where he was staying. The bride wore a white dress and a white veil. Hundreds of relatives and friends sang and danced, blessing and celebrating them. The sound of horns, drums, and the excited screams of Arab women blended into one, creating a joyful and moving scene. The new-style wedding ceremony, which is simple and solemn, has become a new trend welcomed by young people. This also reflects, from one aspect of social life, the innovative spirit of the new generation.

	Creating a More Glorious Future

	On the evening of September 22, the third International Cultural Festival opened at the site of the ancient city of Babylon, which is 4,000 years old. This is an annual international arts festival organized by the Iraqi government to promote Babylonian ancient culture and inspire the people's patriotism. This year, 29 countries, including China, participated in the performance activities. We, the representatives of various countries' trade unions, were also invited to attend the opening ceremony. We took a car from Baghdad to the south, and the vast Mesopotamian plain stretched as far as the eye could see. After about two and a half hours, we arrived at the banks of the Euphrates River, the birthplace of Asian civilization. Walking a few hundred meters further, crossing the drawbridge over the moat, we arrived at the newly renovated ancient city. The light blue city wall was several zhangs high, majestic and imposing, with very beautiful cow and sheep patterns carved on it, lifelike.

	After entering the city gate, hundreds of anciently dressed warriors, each holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, stood proudly along the wall. Some warriors held small bowls of burning incense, with smoke wafting and a fragrant scent filling the air. Under the dim twilight, the bright torches guided the guests into a giant open-air hall, where everyone sat on chairs woven from coarse vines. It felt as if we were experiencing the prehistoric era.

	The exquisite performances by more than 2,000 Iraqi artists recreated the brilliant civilization of Babylon and the glorious history of the Iraqi people, singing the praises of the laboring people's peaceful construction.

	Finally, colorful fireworks soared into the sky, and the stage and the audience erupted in joy.

	"We have the ability to create great miracles like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Great Wall of China. We will definitely create an even more glorious future."

	The host's words on the way back immediately resonated strongly with the fellow travelers, and the crisp, loud applause flew in all directions under the starry sky.

### 巴格达情思

专栏：

　　巴格达情思
　　陈伯霖
　　诚挚的友情
    9月底，应伊拉克总工会的邀请去巴格达参加“工会在促进发展中的作用”的国际讨论会。抵达巴格达国际机场已过午夜，正忙着排队办理入境手续，忽见刚在飞机上结识的一位澳大利亚老太太过来打招呼：
    “喂，陈先生，你的主人已经举着名牌找来了，我早就料到你将受到‘红地毯式’的欢迎，这不是吗？”
    她说得那么正经八百，把周围的旅客都逗乐了，我心中也顿感热乎乎的。心想，自从6月平暴以来，西方一小撮人便一直起劲地鼓噪反华，诋毁我国，而这位素昧平生的普通外国妇女此时此刻所表示的善意，绝不是出于对个人的恭维，而是对中国和中国人民友好感情的自然流露。
    出了机场，小车顺着平坦笔直的公路向市中心急速驶去。一路上，灯光通明如同白昼，两旁郁郁葱葱，远处椰枣林成片。炽热的微风不时掠过，似乎可以闻到广袤无垠的沙漠的气息。车子越开越快，主人的谈锋越健，阿拉伯语英语全用上了。他连连称颂伊中两国的深厚友谊和密切合作，高度赞誉帮助伊拉克建设的中国工人的劳动热情和巨大贡献。他说，前不久北京发生暴乱曾使许多伊拉克朋友担心，后来中国政府胜利地平息暴乱，消息传来，他们感到欢欣鼓舞。国际反华势力企图利用这一事件大做文章，很不得人心。伊中两国的友谊是经得起考验的。说到这里，未曾开口的司机显得格外激动，一双粗壮结实的手干脆离开了方向盘，竖起大拇指，接着又高举有力的拳头，在头顶上不停地挥舞。虽然听不清他在说什么，但我已经深深地被他那奔放的热忱和诚挚的友情所感动，久久难以忘怀！文明和革新
      五彩斑斓的清真寺在骄阳下熠熠生辉，把巴格达这座古城点缀得更加绚丽壮观。式样别致、颜色各异的住宅区散置于市内各个角落。9月末中午气温仍然高达40摄氏度左右，尽管汗流浃背，人们却都衣冠楚楚，甚至年轻的小伙子也几乎没有一人穿着背心裤衩上街的。无论书店还是外国游客出入的高级宾馆，概不出售任何黄色书刊和淫秽的音象制品。
    在伊斯兰星期五公休日的前一夜，笔者在所住的宾馆门前草坪上，遇见三、四对青年男女在举行婚礼。新娘着白色礼服，披雪白的头纱。数以百计的亲朋好友载歌载舞，正在向他们祝福庆贺。喇叭声、手鼓声、阿拉伯妇女兴高采烈的尖叫声汇成一片，欢乐喜悦的场面，异常动人。新式婚礼移风易俗，简单隆重，已成为深受青年欢迎的新风尚。这也从社会生活的一个方面反映出新一代人的革新精神。
　　创造更加光辉的未来
    9月22日晚，第三届国际文化节在4000年前的巴比伦古城旧址开幕。这是伊拉克政府为了弘扬巴比伦古文化，激发人民爱国精神，而举办的一年一度的国际文艺盛会。今年有包括我国在内的29个国家和文艺表演团体参加演出活动。我们各国工会代表也应邀参加了开幕式。我们从巴格达乘车南行，美索不达米亚大平原一望无际，约两个多小时，抵达西亚文明发祥地幼发拉底河畔。再向前步行数百米，越过护城河上的大吊桥，来到修葺一新的古城。淡蓝色的城墙高数丈，气势雄伟，墙上砌有十分优美的牛羊图纹，栩栩如生。
    进了城门，数百名身披盔甲的古装战士，一手持矛、一手执盾，沿着墙根威武挺立，有的武士手捧点燃着香料的小盆，烟雾袅绕，芳馨四溢。在苍茫暮色中，盏盏明亮的火炬把来宾们引进一座巨大的露天殿堂里，在一张张粗篾条编的椅子上就坐，人们仿佛亲历在史前时代。
    2000多名伊拉克艺术家的精湛表演，再现了巴比伦的灿烂文明和伊拉克人民的光辉历史，讴歌劳动人民的和平建设。
      最后，五色缤纷的礼花腾空而起，台上台下一片欢腾。
      “我们的祖先既能创造出像巴比伦空中花园和中国万里长城这样伟大的奇迹来，我们也一定能创造出更加光辉的未来。”
    主人在归途中的这一席话，立即引起同行者的强烈共鸣，清脆响亮的掌声在星空中飞向四面八方。
