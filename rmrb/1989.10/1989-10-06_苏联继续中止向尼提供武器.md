    The Soviet Union continues to suspend arms supplies to Nicaragua
    Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said on October 4 in Managua that, to promote the peace process in Central America, the Soviet government has decided to continue suspending arms supplies to Nicaragua.

    This was announced by the Soviet foreign minister at a press conference held before the end of his visit to Nicaragua. He pointed out that if the situation changes before Nicaragua's general election in February next year and Nicaragua needs to purchase light weapons from the Soviet Union, the Nicaraguan government must disclose which weapons have been purchased.

    At the same time, Shevardnadze emphasized that the Soviet Union will continue to maintain cooperation with Nicaragua in the fields of science, technology, economy, and finance.

    苏联继续中止向尼提供武器
    苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽四日在马那瓜说，为促进中美洲和平进程，苏联政府决定继续中止向尼加拉瓜提供武器。
    这是苏联外长在结束对尼加拉瓜访问前举行的记者招待会上宣布的。他指出，明年二月尼加拉瓜举行大选前，如果形势变化，尼加拉瓜不得不向苏联购买轻型武器时，尼政府必须公布购买了哪些武器。
    与此同时，谢瓦尔德纳泽强调，苏联将继续保持同尼加拉瓜在科技、经济、财政等方面的合作。
