The blind yearn for light, and some sighted individuals hope to help the blind escape darkness. In 1965, Dr. Sivalingam of Sri Lanka (standing in the middle of the lower picture) established the International Eye Bank. Currently, this, the world's largest eye bank, provides cornea transplants to blind individuals from nearly 50 countries of different races and skin colors. In Sri Lanka, with a population of just over 15 million, 800,000 people have signed contracts with this eye bank to donate their corneas after death.

In a school for blind children in Czechoslovakia (upper picture), the children use their hands to touch the mountains and rivers of their homeland, feeling the undulations of the earth, opening a window to understanding the world, and taking the first steps toward independent living. This school has already trained over 1,100 blind individuals who have mastered multiple skills and are adapted to various jobs.

　　让盲人重见光明
    盲人都渴望光明，一些明目人希望能帮助盲人摆脱黑暗。1965年，斯里兰卡的西瓦尔医生（下图中立者）建立了国际眼球库。目前，这个世界上最大的眼球库向近50个国家不同种族、不同肤色的盲人提供移植用眼球。在人口仅1500多万的斯里兰卡，就有80万人同这家眼球库签订了死后捐献眼球的合同。　新华社记者　李政　摄
    在捷克斯洛伐克盲童学校里（上图），盲童们用手触摸祖国的山河，感觉大地的起伏，打开了了解世界的窗口，迈出了独立生活的第一步。这所学校迄今已培养出1100多名掌握多种技能、适应多项工作的盲人。　新华社发
