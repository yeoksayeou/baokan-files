Japan is an island nation with a small land area and scarce resources, but it is surrounded by the sea on all sides. Therefore, Japan has made ocean development one of its economic strategic goals.

Late Start, Rapid Development

Although Japan's fishing, shipbuilding, and near-shore oil and natural gas industries have been developed for some time, large-scale ocean development and utilization began in the early 1980s. In 1979, Japan proposed "The Role of Ocean Development in the 21st Century Society and Economy and the Goals for Ocean Development in the 1990s," and formulated the "Plan to Promote Ocean Development Science and Technology." It established a "government-civilian cooperation" development system: with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Science and Technology Agency taking the lead, universities such as Tokyo University and Kyoto University actively participated, and several large enterprises provided support and cooperation. Since then, Japan's ocean development work has been on track.

Currently, the ocean development industry has become an emerging industry. The world's longest underwater tunnel, the Seikan Tunnel in Japan, was officially opened in 1988, making transportation between Hokkaido and Honshu swift, smooth, and safe, and having a positive impact on mining, shipbuilding, steel production, and social life. The Kansai International Airport, built by filling land in the sea, covers an area of 511 hectares and is known as a "world wonder." Construction is currently underway, with completion scheduled for 1993. The Seto Ohashi Bridge, connecting Honshu and Shikoku, is a massive ocean engineering project that was opened to traffic in April of last year. The Fisheries Agency's 10-year plan for "marine ranching" from 1978 to 1988 focused on developing "aquaculture." After establishing Japan's first marine ranch in Saiki Bay, Oita Prefecture, Japan has set up 70 million mu of artificial reefs in more than 100 near-shore areas, and marine ranching has entered the practical application stage. Japan's ocean development has entered the ranks of the world's leading countries.

Fully Utilizing Technological Advantages

The Japanese government lists ocean science and technology, nuclear energy, and space technology as the three major cutting-edge technologies of the contemporary era. The 1987 outline of the Japanese government's science and technology policy clearly stipulates that "ocean development" is a field that promotes cutting-edge and important scientific technologies, and that technological advantages should be fully utilized.

In ocean research, Japan is actively developing new-generation observation technologies, focusing on two major projects: large-scale ocean observation technology and ocean prediction technology. For example, the 6500-meter deep-sea survey ship currently under construction uses a series of high technologies. The mechanical arm outside the ship is as flexible as a human arm and can pick up an intact egg from the deep sea.

In ocean engineering, Japan's high technology has played a tremendous role. The construction of the Seto Ohashi Bridge first required the installation of giant steel caissons in the sea. To build the foundation on the seabed, it is necessary to "clear the mountains and cut through the terrain" on the seabed. For this purpose, Japan has developed a series of new technologies, such as underwater rock-cutting machines with new structures, ultrasonic detonation methods, electromagnetic-guided detonation methods, and explosives and detonators that can maintain performance for a month in deep water. Japan's underwater blasting technology is at the world's most advanced level. The seabed excavator can accurately collect deep-water data while confirming the flatness of the surface and operating. The advanced technologies created by the Seikan Tunnel, such as preventing tunnel leakage, are now being applied to the Channel Tunnel project.

Looking Towards the Future

Recently, the Japan Ocean Development Construction Association, through analyzing future technological innovations and social needs in the middle of the 21st century, has proposed nine major ocean development projects for the 21st century, with a total investment of 39.08 trillion yen. These projects are highly feasible and economically beneficial, attracting worldwide attention:

Sea-based artificial islands, which will be built approximately 5 kilometers offshore and 50 meters deep, covering an area of about 700 hectares. This island will become a comprehensive city;

Sea-based aviation city, which will be built approximately 40 kilometers offshore and 300 meters deep, covering an area of 950 hectares (almost the same size as Narita Airport). The main building materials will be floating structures, with a steel usage of 3.9 billion tons;

Submarine tunnels, which will be built on steel frames set on the seabed and installed with elliptical steel-reinforced concrete pipes as submarine tunnels. The construction cost is lower than that of deep-sea tunnels and smaller than that of sea bridges. In addition, there are projects such as marine ranching, sea-based cargo airports, sea-based resorts, seabed food storage bases, ocean energy development, and cross-peninsula canals.

### 日本的海洋开发

　　日本的海洋开发
　　张友新
    日本是个岛国，国土狭小，资源贫乏，但四面环海，所以，日本将海洋开发作为经济战略目标之一。
    起步晚　发展快
    虽然日本的渔业、造船业和近海石油、天然气工业早有所发展，但对海洋的大力开发和利用始于80年代初。1979年，日本提出了《海洋开发在21世纪社会经济中的作用和90年代海洋开发的目标》，制定了《推进开发海洋科学技术计划》，组成了“官民合作”型开发体制：以通产省和科学技术厅为主，东京大学、京都大学等高等院校积极参加，一些大企业给予支持和配合。从此，日本的海洋开发工作走上了轨道。
    目前，海洋开发产业已成为新兴工业。世界上最长的海底隧道——日本青函隧道已于1988年正式通车，使本州与北海道的交通变得迅速、畅通和安全，对矿山、造船、钢铁等生产和社会生活产生积极影响。在海上填土建造的关西国际机场造地面积511公顷，被称为“世界奇观”，目前正在加紧施工，预定于1993年竣工。连接本州和四国的濑户内海大桥是一个巨大的海洋工程，已于去年4月通车。水产厅制定的1978—1988年“海洋牧场”10年规划，重点发展“栽培渔业”，自在大分县佐伯湾建成日本第一个海洋牧场后，日本已在近海100多个区域设置人工鱼礁7000万亩，海洋牧场已进入实用化阶段。日本海洋开发跨入世界先进行列。
    充分发挥技术优势
    日本政府把海洋科学技术、原子能和宇宙空间技术并列为当代“三大尖端技术”。1987年日本政府科技政策大纲明确规定：“海洋开发”是一个促进尖端和重要科学技术的领域，要充分发挥技术优势。
    在海洋科研方面，日本积极开发新一代观测技术，主要研究两大项目：大规模海洋观测技术和海洋预测技术。如正在建造的6500米潜水调查船采用了一系列高技术，船外的机械手像人的胳膊一样灵活，能从深海里完整无损地拿起一个生鸡蛋。
    在海洋工程方面，日本高技术发挥了巨大的作用。建设濑户大桥首先要在海中设置巨大的钢制沉箱。在海底构筑基础，必须在海底“开山劈岭”。为此日本开发了一系列新技术，如具有新结构的水中挖岩机、超声波引爆法、电磁制导引爆法，还有能够在深水处维持一个月性能不变的炸药和雷管等。日本的水中爆破技术具有世界最先进的水平。海底挖掘机能准确收集深水数据，一面确认平整面精度，一面作业。青函隧道创造的防止坑道漏水等先进技术，今天已应用于英吉利海峡海底隧道工程。
    面向未来
    最近，日本海洋开发建设协会通过分析今后的技术革新和下世纪中叶的社会需求，提出了下世纪海洋开发9项大型建设项目，总投资39.08万亿日元。这些项目可行性高、经济效益大，为世人所关注：
    海上人工岛，在离岸约5公里、水深50米处填海，建造约700公顷的人工岛，这个岛将成为一个综合性城市；
    海上航空港城市，在离岸约40公里、水深300米的洋面上，建设长5000米、宽1900米、面积950公顷（几乎同成田机场一样大）的机场式城市，建筑材料以浮水构造物为主，钢材用量3.9亿吨；
    海中隧道，在设于海底的钢架上安装椭圆形钢壳钢筋混凝土管道，作为海中隧道，其建设成本既低于深入海底的海底隧道，又小于海上桥梁。此外，还有海洋牧场、海上货运机场、海上疗养所、海底粮食储备基地、海洋能源开发和横穿半岛运河等项目。
