The problem of overloaded freight cars is becoming increasingly severe, posing many safety hazards and threatening transportation security. For instance, from May of last year to June of this year, the Chengdu Railway Bureau discovered 41 overloaded freight cars, with a total overloaded weight of 659 tons. The most severely overloaded car exceeded its limit by 39.4 tons. The causes of overloading can be summarized as follows:

Lack of weighing equipment. Among the 41 overloaded cars, 12 were from different shipping units and stations. Only one of these units had a weighbridge, while the others relied on marking lines or estimating by volume and weight to load the cars. The shippers or loading personnel either miscalculated or did not calculate at all, simply piling the goods onto the cars until they were full, resulting in overloading.

Poor management. Most of the 12 shipping units load their goods onto dedicated lines without an effective inspection and supervision system. Often, they hire farmers to load the cars, and since the farmers are paid by the piece, they load as much as possible to earn more, without considering whether the load is within the limit. On January 11 of this year, the Chengdu East Rolling Stock Inspection Section of the Chengdu Rolling Stock Depot inspected the 2310 train upon its arrival and found that 13 out of 19 cars loaded with pig iron were severely overloaded, with a total excess weight of 222.18 tons.

Intentional overloading. Some people, driven by greed, try every means to save on transportation costs, attempting to load the goods of three cars onto two. On August 21 of last year, inspectors found that one car on the 3407 freight train was severely overloaded. It turned out that the shipper had known about the 22-ton overloading at the departure station but, disregarding railway safety, insisted on loading the excess goods onto the car to make more money.

Negligence at stations. Some station cargo personnel lack a sense of responsibility and fail to enforce strict checks, sometimes even believing the false "code reports" provided by shippers, allowing large quantities of overloaded cars to be released.

To address the problem of severely overloaded freight cars, I believe that the railway department should not only quickly procure the necessary equipment but also establish a comprehensive supervision and inspection system. They should educate cargo personnel to strengthen their sense of responsibility and enforce strict checks to ensure the safety of railway transportation.

### 铁路货车超载  尽快设法克服

　　铁路货车超载  尽快设法克服
    目前，货车严重超载的问题越来越严重，造成了很多事故隐患，危及运输安全。例如，去年5月至今年6月，成都铁路分局共发现41辆货车超载，超载量达659吨，超载最多的一辆竟达39.4吨。超载大致有以下几个原因：
    无计量设备。41辆超载货车属12个发货单位和车站。其中仅一个发货单位有地磅，其余的均靠划线或按体积比重装车。货主或装车人员或计算不准或根本不计算，就按堆装车，装满为止，造成超装。
    管理混乱。12家发货单位大多是在专用线上装车，没有一套行之有效的检查、监督制度，往往是雇用农民工装车，而农民工计件干活，多装多得，根本不考虑超不超载。今年1月11日，成都车辆段成都东列检所对到站的2310次列车进行检查时，发现装生铁的19节车厢，有13节严重超载，共超载222.18吨。
    有意超载。一些钱迷心窍的人，为了节约运费，千方百计在车皮上打主意。3个车的货，想用两个车皮就装走。去年8月21日，检车员发现3407次货车一节车厢严重超载。原来，发货人在发站时，已知超装22吨，发货人为了赚钱，不顾铁路安全，硬把超载货物装上车。
    车站未严格把关。一些车站的货运人员责任心不强，把关不严，有的甚至轻信货主谎报的“报码单”，致使大量超载车放出。
    为了解决货车严重超载的问题，我认为铁路部门除了要尽快添置必要的设备外，还要建立起一整套监督检查制度，教育货运人员增强责任心把好关，以保证铁路运输的安全。
