Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Nan said today that due to the close cooperation and joint efforts of the Chinese and Portuguese governments, significant progress has been made in implementing the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Macao issue.

Zhou Nan made these remarks at a dinner held in honor of Macao Governor Carlos D’Assumpção. He said that the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group and the Sino-Portuguese Land Group have both conducted effective work. The drafting of the Basic Law of Macao has also begun in a step-by-step manner.

He said he was pleased that, thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, the friendly cooperative relations between China and Portugal, as well as their cooperation in implementing the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, have not been affected or disrupted by the June 4th incident in Beijing.

D’Assumpção, in his response, said that the Joint Declaration “has become the focal point of the relationship between the two countries, and strict adherence to it continues to be a commitment that both sides have consistently reiterated since its signing, and is always regarded as a responsibility that transcends any changes in the situation.”

D’Assumpção arrived in Beijing this afternoon at the invitation of Zhou Nan.

    据新华社北京10月4日电　外交部副部长周南今天说，由于中国和葡萄牙政府的密切合作和共同努力，贯彻中葡关于澳门问题的联合声明的工作取得了积极成果。
    周南在欢迎澳门总督文礼治的宴会上说，中葡联合联络小组和中葡土地小组都进行了卓有成效的工作。澳门基本法的起草工作也开始有步骤地进行。
    他说，他感到欣慰的是，由于中葡双方的共同努力，中葡两国的友好合作关系以及双方在贯彻中葡联合声明方面的合作并未因北京六月风波的发生而受到影响和干扰。
    文礼治在答辞中说，联合声明“已成为两国关系的重点，而对它的严格遵守，继续是双方由签署日起经常重申的一项承诺，并经常视为驾凌于局面任何变迁的一项责任。”
    文礼治是应周南的邀请于今天下午到达北京的。
