AIDS and Social Ills
Zhang Qihua

A 28-year-old typesetter from Paris, Marc Konzi, discovered he had AIDS two years ago. Since then, he has been living off a monthly allowance of 2,700 francs. On October 11, Konzi appeared on a television program discussing AIDS, where he shared the difficulties he has faced since his diagnosis. He stated that in France, AIDS is also a "social disease."

Statistics show that more than one-third of the audience watching that night tuned in to this program, indicating the high level of concern from various sectors of society. The spread of AIDS in France is quite severe. In recent years, thousands have died from the disease, and thousands more are still undergoing treatment. The number of infected individuals is rapidly increasing, with an average of 58 new cases reported each week.

The increasing number of AIDS patients reflects the growing severity of social issues in France. The plight of AIDS patients, in turn, exacerbates these social problems.

Firstly, normal employment is threatened. Employers go to great lengths to exclude and fire such patients. One participant in the discussion, tears streaming down his face, said he had lost his livelihood and, in desperation, wrote to the government begging for 1,000 francs, but what good would that do?

There is a lack of reliable medical insurance. Some patients who seek to join medical insurance are rejected by insurance companies for fear of the burden. Some doctors, for various reasons, also advise patients not to disclose their condition to insurance companies. To date, some patients have not received full reimbursement for their medication. Thus, those who truly need social protection and care are often the ones forgotten by society. Due to the loss of economic support and the lack of necessary insurance, they may face penalties such as imprisonment, seizure of property, and disconnection of utilities for failing to repay debts on time.

The theme of this television discussion was "AIDS and Money," and the debate was intense, with strong criticism directed at the government. It is reported that the French government allocated 600 million francs this year for the treatment, research, and promotion of AIDS awareness. However, there are many questions about how this money is being used and its effectiveness. People ask, when research labs are struggling to secure funding and many patients cannot afford medical treatment and are unemployed, why is 75 million francs being spent on producing an AIDS awareness advertisement? Additionally, why are some doctors burdened with the responsibility of treating 250 patients, while associations supposedly dedicated to preventing and treating AIDS are engaging in various profit-making activities?

A Paris newspaper commented, "AIDS patients are suffering from the double pain of the disease and social ills."

### 艾滋病与社会病

　　艾滋病与社会病
　　张启华
    巴黎排版工人姆康齐，28岁，两年前发现患艾滋病，从此每月靠2700法郎的救济金过日子。10月11日，姆康齐出现在电视台组织的一次艾滋病问题讨论会上，向公众诉说了他患病后遇到的种种困难。他说，在法国，艾滋病也是一种“社会病”。
    据统计，当天晚上，坐在电视机前的观众中，有1／3多收看了这个节目，足见社会各界对此的关注。法国艾滋病的蔓延相当严重，近年来，已有上千人死于艾滋病，还在治疗中的病人达数千个，而且患病者人数还在迅速增加，平均每周达58人。
    艾滋病患者的日益增多，表明法国社会问题日趋严重。而艾滋病患者的困难处境又加重了社会问题。
    首先是正常的就业受到了威胁。老板们千方百计排挤、解雇这样的患者，参加讨论会的一个病者边哭边说，他已断了生计，无奈向国家写信，乞求到1000法郎，但这能起多大的作用呢？
    缺乏可靠的医疗保险制度。有些患病者要求参加医疗保险，保险公司因怕背包袱不给解决。有些医生出于种种原因，也建议病人不向保险公司申报病情。迄今一部分病人没有享受药物百分之百报销的待遇。这样，真正需要社会保护、照顾的病人恰恰成了被社会遗忘的人，由于丧失经济来源，又没有必需的保险制度，他们时时可能因无法按期偿还债务而遭到拘押、没收财产、断电等惩罚。
    这次电视讨论会的命题为“艾滋病和钱”，发言中出现了激烈的争论和对政府的强烈不满。据报道，法国政府今年为艾滋病的治疗、研究、宣传共拨款6亿法郎，但这笔钱怎么使用，效果又是如何，人们提出许多指责和批评。人们问道，当一批实验室拿不到科研费用，许多病员没有钱看病并处在失业的情况下，有人却用7500万法郎去制造一套艾滋病的广告，这究竟为了什么？还有，为什么让一名医生辛辛苦苦地负责疹疗250名患病者，而同时允许一批名为防治艾滋病的协会进行种种赚钱买卖呢？
    巴黎一家报纸评论说，“艾滋病人正受到疾病和社会弊病的双重的痛苦。”
