The Jialindang water area in our township covers nearly 1,500 mu and is the main fish farming base for the township's fishing village. Before 1986, this water area had the highest yield of fresh fish among the outer ponds in our city for several years, and the fishermen's distribution was at the top of the township. Since 1987, the wastewater discharged from the Wuxi County Electric Factory, Wuxi County Titanium Dioxide Factory, and Wuxi Resin Factory has flowed into Jialindang, causing massive fish deaths.

　　污水常流　鲜鱼中毒
　　加林荡上　渔人遭殃
    我乡加林荡水域面积近1500亩，是乡渔业村的主要养鱼基地。1986年前，这片水域亩产鲜鱼数年居我市外荡养鱼之冠，渔民分配列全乡之首。1987年以来，上游无锡县电化厂、无锡县钛白粉厂、无锡树脂厂放出的废水流入加林荡，鱼类大量死亡。
