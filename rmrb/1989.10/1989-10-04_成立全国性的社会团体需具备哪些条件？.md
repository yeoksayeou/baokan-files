	What are the requirements for establishing a national-level social organization?

	Question: In recent years, various types of national-level social organizations have been established, which undoubtedly plays a positive role in promoting the development of our country's cultural undertakings. However, some academic societies or associations only consider their economic benefits and lack a strict management system, resulting in frequent incidents of fraudulent activities. To facilitate public supervision, please introduce the conditions required for establishing a national-level social organization.

	Answer: Social organizations refer to various academic societies, associations, research societies, federations, friendship associations, promotion societies, foundations, and chambers of commerce, which are formed by a certain number of citizens or legal entities for common purposes, according to certain principles, and voluntarily, and do not aim to make profits. Currently, social organizations in our country can be divided into social academic organizations (which can be further divided into natural sciences and social sciences), social economic organizations, overseas Chinese affairs organizations, news organizations, cultural organizations, educational organizations, health organizations, sports organizations, and religious organizations, according to their business activities.

	The State Council has clearly stipulated that various social organizations (excluding profit-making companies, enterprises, and public institutions) nationwide are uniformly registered and managed by the civil affairs departments; national-level social organizations are registered and managed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. At present, we are drafting the regulations for the registration and management of social organizations. Once the regulations are issued, we will start a comprehensive cleanup, rectification, and re-registration of existing social organizations in accordance with the relevant regulations.

	The following conditions must be met to establish a national-level social organization:

	1. It must comply with the Constitution and relevant laws, safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, and not harm the interests of the state, society, collective, or the lawful rights and interests of other citizens.

	2. It must have a certain number of members, elected leaders through democratic procedures, a fixed office location, and legal funds (self-raised). Its members must have sufficient breadth and representativeness, be able to independently carry out civilian exchanges, and its activities must cover the entire country.

	3. It must meet the requirements for legal person status and be able to independently bear civil liabilities.

	4. The name of a national-level social organization can include the words "China," "Chinese," or "National" to distinguish it from local social organizations.

	5. The establishment of a national-level social organization also requires examination by the relevant business supervising departments.

	Currently, the Ministry of Civil Affairs is handling the registration of newly established national-level social organizations. If the conditions are met, registration can be applied for.

    成立全国性的社会团体需具备哪些条件？
    问：近几年来，各种类型的全国性社会团体相继成立，这无疑对于促进我国文化事业的发展起着积极的推动作用。但是有的学会或协会只考虑他们的经济效益，缺乏一套严格的管理制度，因而挂牌行骗的事时有所闻。为有利于广大群众的监督，请介绍一下成立全国性的社会团体需要具备哪些条件？
              北京　黎明
    答：社会团体是指由一定数量的公民或法人为了共同的目的，按照一定的原则，自愿组成的各种学会、协会、研究会、联合会、联谊会、促进会、基金会、商会等不以营利为目的的社会组织。目前，我国的社团按照业务活动可分为：社会学术组织（又可分为自然科学、哲学社会科学）、社会经济组织、侨务组织、新闻组织、文化组织、教育组织、卫生组织、体育组织、宗教组织等等。
    国务院明确了全国各种社团（除营利性的公司、企业和事业单位外）由民政部门统一登记管理；全国性社团由民政部登记管理。目前，我们正在草拟社会团体登记管理条例，待条例一出台，我们将按有关规定开始对原有社团进行全面的清理、整顿和重新登记。
    成立全国性的社团应具备以下几个条件：
    一、必须符合宪法和有关法律的规定，维护国家的统一和民族的团结，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法权利。
    二、应有一定数量的成员，有经过民主选举的负责人，有固定的办公地点和合法的经费（自筹），其成员应具有足够的广泛性、代表性，能够独立地开展民间交往活动，其活动范围遍及全国。
    三、必须具备法人条件，能够独立承担民事责任。
    四、全国性社团的名称可以冠以中华、中国、全国等字样，以别于地方性社团。
    五、成立全国性社团还须经有关业务主管部门的审查。
    现在，民政部已承办新成立的全国性社团的注册登记业务，如条件具备的可来注册登记。
