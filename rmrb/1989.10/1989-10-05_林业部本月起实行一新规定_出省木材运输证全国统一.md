The State Forestry Administration will implement a new regulation starting this month, unifying out-of-province timber transport permits nationwide. The new regulation aims to strengthen the supervision and management of timber transport and control the consumption of forest resources.

The State Forestry Administration has decided that starting from October this year, a unified out-of-province timber transport permit will be implemented nationwide. Simultaneously, the use of out-of-province timber transport permits issued by various provinces and regions will be discontinued.

In the "Notice on Issues Related to the Issuance and Management of Out-of-Province Timber Transport Permits," the State Forestry Administration requires that forestry administrative departments in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must strengthen the leadership of timber transport management work. They must implement total quantity control over the amount of timber transported out of the province each year, striving to achieve strict control over timber transport (down the mountain), thereby promoting strict control over logging (up the mountain). This will ensure that the provisions of the "Forest Law" regarding the limited consumption of forests are truly implemented.

The notice stipulates that for timber transported out of the province that is not subject to national unified allocation, a new "Out-of-Province Timber Transport Permit" issued by the provincial forestry administrative department must be presented for transport.

    林业部本月起实行一新规定
    出省木材运输证全国统一
    新华社北京电　为加强木材运输的监督管理，控制森林资源消耗，林业部决定，从今年10月起，在全国实行统一的出省木材运输证，同时停止使用各省区原来印制的出省木材运输证件。
    林业部在《关于出省木材运输证发放与管理有关问题的通知》中要求各省、区、市林业主管部门要加强木材运输管理工作的领导，对每年出省外运的木材数量实行总量控制，努力做到山下（运输）管严，进而促进山上（采伐）管住，把《森林法》中关于对森林实行限额消耗的规定真正落到实处。《通知》规定，凡是运输出省的非国家统一调拨的木材，必须凭各省林业主管部门签发的新的《出省木材运输证》运输。
