Original members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held a meeting in Budapest on the evening of the 16th and announced that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party still exists and will hold a party congress later this year.

The meeting was initiated by the chairman of the "Marxist Unity Program" faction within the former Socialist Workers' Party, Ribansky, and other members. About 1,000 party representatives from across the country who share similar views participated in the meeting.

Ribansky said in his speech that the recent party congress decision to transform the party into a social democratic party went against the will of the majority of party members. He expressed his opposition to the resolution of that party congress and its analysis of the domestic situation in Hungary.

The meeting issued a call stating that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party will form a temporary leadership body and prepare to hold the party's 14th congress this year. The call also suggested that Grosz lead this party.

    原匈党部分党员召开会议宣布
    匈社会主义工人党依然存在
    新华社布达佩斯10月17日电　原匈牙利社会主义工人党的部分党员16日晚在布达佩斯召开会议，宣布匈社会主义工人党仍然存在，并且将于今年晚些时候召开一次党代表大会。　　　
    这次会议是由原社会主义工人党内的“马克思主义统一纲领派”主席里班斯基等人发起的，来自全国各地持相同观点的党员代表约1000人参加了会议。
    里班斯基在讲话中说，不久前召开的社会主义工人党党代会决定将党改建成社会党违背了广大党员的意志。他表示反对那次党代会的决议和对匈国内形势的分析。
    会议在一份呼吁书中宣布，匈牙利社会主义工人党即将组成临时领导机构，准备在今年召开党的14大，并建议由格罗斯领导这个党。
