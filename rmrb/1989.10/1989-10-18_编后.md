Harnessing the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to encourage social forces to engage in education is a crucial measure for developing China's educational sector. Various colleges, research institutions, and academic organizations have established short-term training classes, seminars, and workshops in different fields, which are an integral part of social education initiatives. Undoubtedly, these efforts have played a positive role in training teachers, engineers, and party and government cadres, enhancing their professional knowledge.

However, several issues have emerged during the establishment of these classes. Primarily, some government agencies, organizations, schools, and individuals have started classes without approval from the relevant authorities, often without the necessary conditions for education. They hastily enroll students, promising diplomas or setting up classes in scenic tourist spots to attract learners. While it is natural for these classes to generate income, some organizers have made profits their primary goal, charging exorbitant and varied tuition fees. Some "practical" training classes have particularly high fees. Moreover, some classes are merely in name, with poor teaching quality. For instance, they cobble together teaching materials and hire random instructors, leading to significant dissatisfaction among students. Additionally, most training classes lack standardized receipts and official payment stamps, resulting in inadequate financial supervision. There have been instances of financial misconduct and embezzlement.

To ensure the healthy development of social education, it is essential to strengthen management. Relevant departments should promptly formulate, improve, and implement regulations for social education. They should meticulously review the establishment of political and policy-related study classes and seminars and set standards for tuition fees and teacher compensation. Organizers of these classes should use standardized receipts and official payment stamps. Educational, auditing, and supervisory departments should enhance inspections and supervision to ensure that educational institutions comply with laws and regulations, genuinely contributing to society by cultivating talent.

    发挥社会各方面的积极性，鼓励社会力量办学，是发展我国教育事业的一项措施。一些大专院校、科研单位和学术团体，开办各种专业的短期进修班、培训班、研讨班，是社会办学的一个组成部分。毫无疑问，这为一些单位培训教师、工程技术人员和党政干部，提高他们某种专业知识，起了积极的作用。
    但是，在办班过程中也出现了一些值得注意的问题，主要是：少数机关、团体、学校和个人不经主管部门批准，在不具备办学条件的情况下，仓促上马，盲目招生。他们或承诺发给大专毕业证书；或把办班地点设在旅游风景点，以此招揽学员。办班当然要有收入。但一些办班单位以盈利为目的，向学员收取五花八门的学费，有的“实用型”培训班的学费更是贵得惊人。有的培训班只徒有虚名，不注重教学质量。如：东拼西凑一些教材，随便找一些人上课，学员意见很大。另外，大部分培训班无统一的收据和收款专用章，缺乏有效的财政监督，违反财政纪律、中饱私囊者不乏其人。
    为使社会办学活动健康发展，关键是必须加强管理。有关部门应尽快制定和完善、实施有关社会力量办学的管理条例，对举办政治性、政策性学习班和研讨班的要认真审查；要规定各种培训班的收费及教师课酬的标准。办班单位要使用统一的收据和收款专用章。教育、审计和主管部门要加强检查监督，使办学单位能够遵纪守法，真正为社会培养人才。
