Recently, ticket offices for railways, civil aviation, highways, and waterways across the country have added a new service. Mid-career and young scientific, technological, and managerial experts who have made outstanding contributions and are approved by the state can purchase train, ship, and airplane tickets in advance when they go out for work or attend academic conferences, by presenting their "Certificate for Mid-Career and Young Experts with Outstanding Contributions."

A relevant official from the Ministry of Personnel said that this is a practical measure taken by relevant state departments for mid-career and young experts with outstanding contributions. In 1984, 1986, and 1988, the state selected more than 2,500 mid-career and young scientific, technological, and managerial experts with outstanding contributions in three rounds.

    铁路民航公路水运部门新规定
　　贡献突出中青年专家购票优先
    据新华社北京电　（记者卓培荣）最近全国铁路、民航和公路、水运的售票处开始增加一项新的服务。经国家批准的有突出贡献的中青年科学、技术和管理专家，外出工作或参加学术会议时，可凭《有突出贡献中青年专家证书》优先购买车、船、机票。
    人事部有关负责人说，这是国家有关部门为有突出贡献中青年专家办的一件实事。1984、1986和1988年，国家曾三次选拔了2500多名有突出贡献的中青年科学、技术和管理专家。
