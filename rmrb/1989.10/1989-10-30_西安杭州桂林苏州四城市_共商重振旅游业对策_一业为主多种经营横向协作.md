	Xi'an, Hangzhou, Guilin, and Suzhou, four major tourist cities, recently gathered in Guilin to discuss strategies for revitalizing the tourism industry.

	The four cities reached a consensus during the discussions: to make the tourism industry more resilient, it is necessary to change the industrial structure of tourism and move beyond the basic single model of reception and sightseeing. The approach should be "one main business, multiple operations," transforming tourism enterprises into multifunctional business entities.

	Another consensus among the four cities is to promote the survival and development of tourism through horizontal cooperation and collaboration. This meeting of the four cities' mayors decided to conduct the following horizontal cooperation: jointly attracting tourists, promoting regional tourism; jointly developing, producing, and selling tourism products; learning from each other's experiences in the development and construction of scenic areas and attractions; and cooperating in tourism personnel training and exchanging academic and theoretical discussions. The four cities believe that hotspot cities with unique tourism resources working together will be beneficial in elevating the tourism industry to a new level.

    西安杭州桂林苏州四城市
　　共商重振旅游业对策
    一业为主多种经营横向协作
    本报桂林10月29日电　记者郑盛丰报道：西安、杭州、桂林、苏州4个热点旅游城市的主管副市长、旅游局长和有关部门负责人，近日聚会桂林共商重振旅游业对策。
    4市在讨论中获得一个共识：要使旅游业由脆弱变为坚韧，就得改变旅游产业结构，改变基本局限于接待观光的单一旅游经营方式，实行“一业为主，多种经营”，把旅游企业办成多功能的经营实体。
    通过开展横向联合与协作，谋求旅游的生存与发展，这是4市旅游界的另一个共识。这次4市市长座谈会经过磋商，决定进行包括以下内容的横向协作：联合招徕客源，推行区域旅游；共同研制、生产、销售旅游商品；相互学习景区、景点的开发与建设经验；开展旅游人才培训的合作和旅游学术与理论的交流探讨。4市认为，旅游资源各具特色的热点城市携手合作，有利于把旅游业推上新水平。
