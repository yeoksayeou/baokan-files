Strengthen Regional Cooperation to Promote Latin American Integration
The Third Summit of the Latin American Eight Nations Opens

BEIJING, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) — The third summit of the Latin American Eight Nations Group opened today in Ica, Peru. The presidents of the participating countries unanimously expressed their commitment to strengthening the group and promoting Latin American integration to jointly address challenges and difficulties.

The presidents attending the opening ceremony included Peru's Alan Garcia, Argentina's Carlos Menem, Brazil's Jose Sarney, Colombia's Virgilio Barco, Mexico's Carlos Salinas, Uruguay's Julio Maria Sanguinetti, and Venezuela's Jaime Lusinchi. Panama has been suspended from participating in the group's activities since February last year due to domestic issues and has not yet resumed participation.

Due to the severe violence in Peru at present, this meeting was held in the small city of Ica, about 300 kilometers south of Lima. The city of Ica, under strict security, is an oasis in the desert along Peru's western coast, with poor working conditions but easy to defend. The presidents first flew to the Pisco military airbase, about 100 kilometers from Ica, and then took Peruvian military helicopters directly to a golf course next to the venue. The opening ceremony was held in a large white tent set up next to the golf course. Subsequent working meetings will be held in the conference rooms of the "Cactus Hotel" where the golf course is located.

The host country's president, Alan Garcia, spoke first. In his speech, he emphasized the urgency of Latin American countries taking the path of integration in the new international situation. Garcia believed that the world is currently undergoing dramatic changes. The two major blocs of economic, military, and ideological power that have existed since the end of World War II are converging. Dialogue has led to arms reduction agreements, while countries like the Soviet Union are undergoing reforms that cause social upheaval. He said that behind these arms reductions and Soviet reforms, the international market is also restructuring, and the existing North-South economic relations are being replaced by new East-West economic relations. The United States, Western Europe, and Japan are trying to turn the Soviet Union and China into consumers of their technology and capital. The West is investing the capital for debt repayment by Latin American and Third World countries into the expanding Eastern market. In this situation, the position of any single Latin American country in negotiations will become increasingly weakened. Latin America can only secure a place in the current global market restructuring through a broad range of economic integration and national unity. Latin American countries must make a joint decision and take united action to address the various problems they face together. He also advocated that a united Latin America should engage in equal dialogue with the United States on issues such as debt, drugs, and environmental protection, sharing responsibilities.

The other six presidents also spoke from different angles about the need to strengthen coordination on issues such as debt, anti-drug efforts, and environmental protection, and to promote the process of integration, expressing their desire for unity.

Before the summit, on the 9th and 10th of this month, the Eight Nations Group held a preparatory meeting at the ministerial level in Trujillo, north of Lima. According to local newspaper reports, the preparatory meeting discussed the Panama issue but did not reach a consensus on whether to expel Panama from the Eight Nations Group. It is expected that the Panama issue will remain a major topic at the summit.

    加强地区性合作　推动拉美一体化
    拉美八国集团第三次首脑会议开幕
    本报秘鲁伊卡10月11日电　记者朱满庭报道：拉美8国集团第三次首脑会议今天正式在此间开幕。各国总统一致表示，要继续加强8国集团，推动拉美一体化，共同对付困难和挑战。
    出席会议开幕式的有秘鲁总统阿兰·加西亚、阿根廷总统梅内姆、巴西总统萨尔内、哥伦比亚总统巴尔科、墨西哥总统萨利纳斯、乌拉圭总统桑吉内蒂和委内瑞拉总统佩雷斯。巴拿马自去年2月以后因国内问题被暂停与会资格，至今一直未参加8国集团的活动。
    由于秘鲁当前的暴力活动十分严重，这次会议选择在离利马以南300处的小城伊卡举行。处于严密戒备状态下的伊卡市是秘鲁西部沿海沙漠带中的一个绿洲，工作条件较差，但易于防卫。总统们先乘飞机抵达距伊卡100公里处的皮斯科空军基地，然后再乘秘鲁空军的直升机直接降落在会场旁边的一个高尔夫球场上。会议开幕式就是在这个高尔夫球场边上一个临时搭起的白色大帐篷内举行的。以后的工作会议则将在高尔夫球场所在的“仙人掌旅馆”的会议室内举行。
    东道国秘鲁总统首先发言，他在讲话中突出强调了在新的国际形势下，拉美国家必须走一体化道路的迫切性。阿兰·加西亚总统认为，当前世界正处在剧烈变动的时期，战后40年间分成经济、军事和意识形态两大集团的大国正在接近。对话并达成了减少核武器的裁军协议，同时苏联等国家则在进行引起社会震荡的改革。他说，在这种裁军与苏联改革的背后，国际市场也在重组，现存的南北经济关系正在为东西方新的经济关系取代。美国、西欧、日本正力图把苏联、中国变成它们的技术与资本的消费者。西方正把拉美和第三世界国家还债的资本投向东方的扩大市场。在这种形势下任何一个拉美国家单独进行谈判的地位将日益削弱。拉丁美洲只有在大范围的一体化经济、各国的团结中才能在今天的世界市场重组中占有一席之地。拉美国家只有共下决心，联合行动才能对付共同面临的各种问题。他还主张联合起的拉美与美国就债务、毒品、环境保护等问题上平等地对话共同承担责任。
    其它6位总统在发言中也从不同角度谈到了在债务、反毒品、环境保护等问题上要加强协调，推动一体化进程，表示了团结的愿望。
    这次首脑会议之前的9日、10日两天，8国集团在利马以北的特鲁希略市召开了外长级预备会议。据当地报纸报道，预备会议讨论了巴拿马问题，但未能在是否把巴拿马开除出8国集团达成一致。预计巴拿马问题仍将是首脑会议上的主要议题。
