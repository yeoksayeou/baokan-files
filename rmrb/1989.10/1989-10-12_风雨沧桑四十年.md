	Forty Years of Storms and Changes

	By Shi Mingshen, People's Daily Reporter

	To many people, the word "insurance" seems to have only entered their vocabulary in recent years. However, the China People's Insurance Company is the same age as the People's Republic, and is now stepping into its "fortieth year." Recently, the reporter interviewed General Manager Qin Daofu on this topic. Revival in the Reform

	Soon after the national liberation in 1949, the state established the China People's Insurance Company on the basis of reforming the old insurance industry on October 20, marking the beginning of a new chapter in China's insurance history. Reflecting on the ups and downs of the insurance industry over 40 years, Qin Daofu is filled with emotion. He said that the fate of the insurance industry is closely tied to the country's economic development. When the economy develops, insurance thrives; when the economy stagnates, insurance declines. In the early years of the founding of the nation, the insurance business developed rapidly, making significant contributions to the recovery of the national economy. By 1958, a total of 380 million yuan in compensation and personal insurance payments had been made, accumulating 1.2 billion yuan in construction funds for the state. In addition, the insurance company allocated a considerable amount of disaster prevention and epidemic prevention subsidies to relevant departments, significantly enhancing the country's disaster prevention capabilities. However, due to mistakes in the guidance of economic construction, the insurance industry, which had just started, was blown down by the "communist wind" that swept through the country in early 1959. At that time, the emphasis was on "big and public," and people's food, clothing, birth, old age, illness, death, and disaster accidents were all taken care of by the state and collectives, believing that there was no need for insurance. Therefore, starting from 1959, except for a small amount of foreign insurance business that was retained, domestic business was forced to stop. During the Cultural Revolution, the Lin Biao and the Gang of Four denounced the insurance company as a "company of exploitation" and proposed slogans such as "smash the insurance." Fortunately, Premier Zhou insisted that insurance must be done, and foreign-related insurance business was spared from being shut down. Thus, for 20 years, the insurance industry was tossed around, leaving a blank in the national economy and in people's minds. Looking back at the past bumpy experiences, Qin Daofu said that it was the reform and opening-up policy that gave the insurance industry a new life and the opportunity to thrive. In 1979, the State Council approved the China People's Insurance Company to resume domestic insurance business and issued multiple documents, requiring relevant departments and local governments to support insurance work and help them solve practical difficulties. Over the past 10 years, the China People's Insurance Company has established more than 2,800 branches nationwide in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, regions, and counties, with over 70,000 employees; established more than 70,000 agency outlets of various forms, with over 150,000 agency personnel. In recent years, the insurance company has operated nearly 300 types of domestic and foreign insurance, with business volume increasing by nearly 50% each year. The annual premium income has increased from 464 million yuan in 1980 to 10.9 billion yuan in 1988, and is expected to reach 13 billion yuan this year. A total of more than 6 billion yuan in taxes and profits have been remitted to the state and local governments, accumulating nearly 10 billion yuan in various insurance liability reserves, with assets reaching 11 billion yuan, making it one of the world's most powerful insurance companies.

	The "Stabilizer" of the Social Economy

	Why has China's insurance industry been able to develop so rapidly? Qin Daofu answered that the fundamental reason is the development of socialist commodity economy, which requires the support of the insurance industry. In other words, the insurance industry plays the role of a "stabilizer" in the social economy.

	China is an agricultural country with frequent natural disasters that directly threaten agricultural production. It is estimated that due to the impact of floods, droughts, typhoons, and hailstorms, an average of 10 billion kilograms of grain crops are lost each year. After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, the production units in rural areas have become smaller, and the operational risks have increased. Once farmers encounter natural disasters or accidents, they cannot completely rely on the small amount of relief funds provided by the government to solve the problem, so they urgently need insurance to stabilize farmers' production enthusiasm and compensate for unexpected economic losses. In recent years, the insurance company has actively launched agricultural crop, livestock, poultry, aquaculture, and forest insurance, which has been warmly welcomed by local governments and farmers. In cities, the demand for insurance is highest among state-owned enterprises, which are the main providers of state fiscal revenue. The old method of having the state write off disaster accident losses is no longer feasible. Enterprises are gradually moving towards self-management and self-responsibility for profits and losses, and must consider how to disperse risks if a disaster accident occurs. Nowadays, almost every wise entrepreneur, when designing his enterprise development blueprint, will not forget to set aside a small amount of insurance premiums to transfer unpredictable, potentially huge risk losses. Even large enterprises like Daqing Oilfield, Shengli Oilfield, and the Northeast and North China power grids regard "insurance" as a backbone for stable operations. So far, the insurance company has insured various types of property worth 1,797 billion yuan.

	Since the late 1970s, more and more overseas manufacturers have invested in China, and a large number of "three-in-one" enterprises have emerged. Foreign tourists are increasing, and Chinese labor exports have also developed to a certain extent. Based on continuing to handle the original foreign-related insurance types, the insurance company has recently launched more than 80 types of insurance, including satellite launches, offshore oil development, construction and installation projects, overseas contracting projects, business interruption, and employer's liability insurance, and has made efforts to comply with international customs in terms of clauses and rates.

	The development of insurance business has not only raised a considerable amount of construction funds for the state but has also greatly enhanced the insurance company's compensation capability. Qin Daofu confidently said that no matter where a major disaster occurs, the insurance company has the ability to quickly compensate. In the past 10 years, a total of 9.65 million insurance compensation cases have been handled nationwide, with 12.9 billion yuan in compensation paid. People have not forgotten that in the Great Xing'anling region, which has suffered from severe forest fires, half of the funds for rebuilding homes came from the insurance company's compensation of 1.18 billion yuan; last year, after Zhejiang, Yunnan, and other places suffered from typhoons, floods, and earthquakes, they were able to quickly raise the sails of life again, which also benefited from insurance compensation. This spring and summer, a severe hailstorm, typhoon, and heavy rain caused many places in Sichuan Province to have collapsed houses, factories to stop production, and farmlands to be submerged, and the crops that were about to be harvested were lost... Again, it was the insurance company that timely sent 700 million yuan in compensation, helping them in disaster relief.

	Qin Daofu added that in our country, insurance compensation not only plays an economic compensation role but also embodies the cohesion of a socialist society, inspiring people to display greater vitality and enthusiasm in disaster recovery and production.

	With the prosperity of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards, the public's dependence on the insurance industry is also increasing. Qin Daofu recalled that at the end of 1979, when domestic business was just resumed, the entire Beijing only had one household participating in family property insurance, and there were fewer than 30,000 households nationwide participating in this type of insurance. Now, there are more than 62 million households participating, and the number is still increasing. The development of personal insurance, which is closely related to people's lives, is also very rapid. In 1982, the number of insured people was nearly 100,000, with a premium income of 1.58 million yuan; by 1988, the number of people participating in various types of personal insurance nationwide had reached 100 million, which is 100 times the number in 1982. Student safety insurance, child marriage insurance, personal accidental injury insurance, and old-age pension insurance have all rapidly developed nationwide.

	Striding Toward New Heights

	After 40 years of tempering, China's insurance industry has made remarkable progress not only in the development of domestic business but also in the international insurance market. In the late 1950s, although domestic business was suspended, China's overseas insurance companies continued to actively operate. In the fierce competition of the international insurance market, they have been struggling. So far, overseas companies and branches established in Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and other countries and regions have reached more than 40. Due to excellent service and flexible operation, they enjoy a high reputation among local clients.

	When talking about exchanges and cooperation with international insurance counterparts, Qin Daofu said that China is one of the founding countries of the Asian and African Insurance Reinsurance Union and is also a member of the Asian Reinsurance Company. Over the years, it has established reinsurance relationships with more than 1,000 insurance companies, reinsurance companies, and insurance brokerage companies in more than 120 countries and regions, on the one hand, dispersing the risks of major projects to the global insurance market, and on the other hand, also accepting some business from other member countries.

	As the interview was about to end, Qin Daofu told the reporter that the insurance industry has a long way to go, and the China People's Insurance Company will continue to work hard, constantly open up new areas of operation, and provide good service for the cause of socialism and for domestic and foreign customers.

    风雨沧桑四十年
    本报记者　施明慎
    在许多人的印象里，听说“保险”这个词只是近几年的事。殊不知，中国人民保险公司与共和国同龄，正在大步跨入她的“不惑之年”。不久前，记者就这个话题访问了秦道夫总经理。在改革中复苏
    1949年全国解放不久，国家在对旧保险业改造的基础上，于10月20日迅速组建了中国人民保险公司，从此揭开了中国保险史的新篇章。谈起保险事业40年的风风雨雨，秦道夫感慨万分。他说，保险业的命运和国家的经济发展紧密相连。经济发展，保险必然兴旺；经济停滞，保险也会走下坡路。建国初期，保险业务发展较快，为恢复国民经济做出了重要贡献。到1958年共支付赔款和人身保险金3.8亿元，为国家积累了12亿元建设资金。此外，保险公司还拨付给有关部门相当数量防灾、防疫补助费，有力地加强了社会的防灾能力。然而，由于经济建设指导思想上的失误，刚刚起步的保险业被1959年初刮起的一阵“共产风”吹垮了。当时片面强调“一大二公”，人们的吃、穿、生、老、病、死以及灾害事故都由国家和集体包下来，认为没有必要办保险。因而自1959年起，除少量国外保险业务保留下来，国内业务被迫停止办理。“文革”期间，林彪、“四人帮”一伙把保险公司污蔑为“剥削公司”，提出“砸烂保险”等口号，幸亏周总理坚持，保险还是要办的，涉外保险业务才免遭停办的命运。就这样反反复复折腾了20年，使保险业在国民经济里，在人们的头脑中出现一片空白。回顾以往坎坷的经历，秦道夫说，是改革开放的政策使保险业获得了新生和蓬勃发展的机会。1979年国务院批准中国人民保险公司恢复办理国内保险业务，并多次发文，要求有关部门和地方政府支持保险工作，帮助他们解决实际困难。10年来，中国人民保险公司在全国各省、自治区、市、地区、县，设立了2800多个分支机构，职工已达7万余人；设立各种形式的代理网点7万多个，拥有代办人员15万多人。这几年，保险公司经营的国内外业务近300个险种，业务量几乎以每年50％的速度递增，年保费收入已从1980年的4.64亿元增至1988年的109亿元，估计今年可达130亿元。累积上缴国家和地方税利60多亿元，积累各种保险责任准备金近百亿元，资产达110亿元，已成为世界上颇具实力的保险公司之一。社会经济的“稳定器”
    我国保险业为什么能够迅速发展？秦道夫回答，根本原因在于社会主义商品经济的发展，需要保险事业的支持。换句话说，保险事业起着社会经济“稳定器”的作用。
    我国是一个农业国家，自然灾害较多，直接威胁着农业生产。据测算，因洪涝、风雹等灾害的影响，平均每年粮食作物减产100亿公斤。农村实行联产承包责任制后，农村生产单位缩小，经营风险增大，农民一旦遇到自然灾害或意外事故，不可能完全依赖政府无偿提供的极少量救济款解决问题，因而迫切需要通过保险来稳定农民的生产积极性，补偿意外经济损失。近几年保险公司积极开办了农作物、牲畜家禽、水产养殖、森林保险等种养业险种，受到当地政府和农民的热烈欢迎。在城市里，对保险需求呼声最高的是国家财政收入的主要提供者——工商企业。以往由国家核销灾害事故损失的老办法如今行不通了。企业逐步走向自主经营、自负盈亏，必然要考虑万一发生灾害事故，如何分散风险的问题。现在，几乎每一个精明的企业家在设计他的企业发展蓝图时，都不会忘记拿出少量的保险费来转移不可预料的、可能发生的巨大风险损失。就连大庆油田、胜利油田、东北、华北电网那样的实力雄厚的中央大企业也把“保险”作为稳定经营的后盾。迄今，保险公司承保的各类财产金额已达17970亿元。
    70年代末以来，来华投资的海外厂商越来越多，“三资”企业大量涌现，外国旅游者不断增多，中国劳务出口也有一定发展。保险公司在继续办理原有涉外险种的基础上，近年又陆续开办了卫星发射、海洋石油开发、建筑和安装工程、海外承包工程、营业中断、雇主责任保险等80多个险种，并在条款、费率上尽量符合国际上的习惯作法。
    保险业务的发展，既为国家筹集了一笔可观的建设资金，又大大地增强了保险公司的赔偿能力。秦道夫信心十足地说，无论在哪里发生大的灾害，保险公司都有能力迅速赔付。近10年来，全国共处理保险赔案965万件，支付赔款129亿元。人们没有忘记，在曾饱尝森林大火肆虐之苦的大兴安岭地区，重建家园的一半资金来自保险公司的赔款1.18亿元；去年浙江、云南等地在遭受台风、洪涝、地震之后能够迅速重新扬起生活的风帆，也得益于保险补偿。今年春夏之间，特大冰雹、狂风暴雨使四川省许多地方房屋倒塌、工厂停产，农田淹没，已经丰收在望的庄稼颗粒无收……又是保险公司及时送来7000多万元赔款，在抗灾中助了他们一臂之力。
    秦道夫补充说，在我们国家，保险赔款不仅起着经济补偿的作用，它还体现着社会主义社会的凝聚力，激励着人们在灾后恢复生产中焕发出更大的活力和干劲。
    随着经济的繁荣，人民生活水平的提高，群众对保险业的依赖性也日益增强。秦道夫回忆道，1979年底，国内业务刚恢复时，整个北京只有一户人家参加家庭财产保险，全国投保这种保险的家庭不足3万户，如今投保的家庭已达6200多万户，而且还有增多的趋势。和人们生活密切相关的人身保险业务发展势头也很猛。1982年投保人数近10万人，收保费158万元；到1988年，全国参加各项人身保险的已达1亿人，是1982年人数的100倍。学生平安保险、子女婚嫁金保险、人身意外伤害保险、养老年金保险等都在全国迅速发展起来了。
    跨向新的高度
    经过40年的锤炼，我国保险事业不仅在国内业务发展方面突飞猛进，而且在国际保险市场上也显得日臻成熟。50年代末，虽然国内业务停办了，但是我国设在海外的保险公司一直积极开展业务。在国际保险市场的激烈竞争中顽强地拚搏着。迄今设在香港、澳门、新加坡、英国等国家和地区的海外公司及分支机构已达40多个。由于服务优良，经营灵活，在当地客户中享有较高信誉。
    谈到与国际保险业同行的交往与合作，秦道夫说，我国是亚非保险再保险联合会的创始国之一，也是亚洲再保险公司的一个成员国。几十年来已与世界上120多个国家和地区的1000多家保险公司、再保险公司和保险经纪公司建立了分保关系，一方面把承保重大项目的风险分散到世界保险市场，另一方面也接受其他成员国的部分业务。
      接近采访尾声时，秦道夫告诉记者，保险事业任重而道远，中国人民保险公司将继续努力，不断开拓经营领域，为社会主义事业，为国内外客户提供良好服务。
