The Shanghai ethylene project, which will provide the country with over 100 million tons of plastic and basic chemical raw materials, has been basically completed. Currently, workers are rushing to prepare for the trial run with materials to ensure that by next April, the entire process will be operational as originally planned, and qualified products will be produced.

This massive project, funded by the enterprise itself, will also repay its domestic and foreign debts on schedule. The Shanghai Petrochemical General Factory issued over 100 million yuan in corporate bonds in 1987, which will start being repaid with interest from January 17, 1990. The repayment of foreign debts will begin this December. Starting next year, this project will use its own earned foreign exchange to repay foreign debts.

This information was released from a recent meeting of the Shanghai 300,000-ton Ethylene Project Leading Group.

The Shanghai 300,000-ton Ethylene Project is the fourth 300,000-ton ethylene project in China, following those in Daqing, Qilu, and Yangzi. The project officially began construction in May 1987, with a total investment of nearly 6 billion yuan. Construction was carried out simultaneously in two locations in the Shanghai suburbs: Jinshan and Wujing. Since September of this year, good news has been frequently reported from both construction sites. Among them, the 300,000-ton ethylene integrated unit was completed on October 9 and will start the trial run with materials in December.

    上海乙烯工程即将试车
    计划明年4月打通全部流程
    据新华社上海10月17日电（记者吴复民）将为国家提供100余万吨塑料和基本化工原料的上海30万吨乙烯工程已经基本建成。目前，工人们正抓紧准备投料试车，以确保明年4月按原定计划打通全部流程，拿出合格产品。
    依靠企业自筹资金建设的这项巨大工程，还将如期偿还内外债。上海石化总厂于1987年发行的上亿元企业债券，将按期从1990年1月17日开始还本付息。外债的偿还将从今年12月份开始。明年起，这项工程将以自己所创的外汇偿还外债。
    这个信息是从最近举行的上海30万吨乙烯工程领导小组会议上传出的。
    上海30万吨乙烯工程，是继大庆、齐鲁、扬子以后的我国第四套30万吨乙烯工程。工程于1987年5月正式开工，总共耗资近60亿元，在上海郊区金山和吴泾两地同时展开建设。今年9月份以来，两个工地捷报频传。其中，年产30万吨乙烯联合装置已在10月9日建成，将于12月投料试车。
