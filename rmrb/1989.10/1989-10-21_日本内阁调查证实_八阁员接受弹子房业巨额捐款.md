Japanese Cabinet Confirms Eight Ministers Received Large Donations from Pachinko Industry

	Tokyo, October 20 (Xinhua) - A report by Yu Qing: The Japanese Cabinet today released an investigation confirming that eight cabinet members collectively received 4.97 million yen in political donations from the pachinko industry.

	Japanese Cabinet Secretary-General Moriyama met with reporters this morning and, as promised a week ago, publicly disclosed the situation regarding cabinet members receiving political donations from the pachinko industry. This includes Prime Minister Kaifu receiving 450,000 yen, Secretary-General Moriyama 120,000 yen, Foreign Minister Nakayama 1.06 million yen, Chief of the Management and Coordination Agency Mizuno 200,000 yen, Minister of Home Affairs Watanabe 300,000 yen, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Oishi 740,000 yen, and Director-General of the Land Agency Ishii 300,000 yen. Including the 1.8 million yen self-disclosed by Minister of Health and Welfare Kuidai, the eight cabinet members collectively received 4.97 million yen.

	Secretary-General Moriyama stated that the political donations received were all properly handled according to the Political Funds Control Law and that there were no issues, hence no need to consider returning them. He also expressed that to avoid any mistakes, a thorough investigation was conducted.

	Public opinion suggests that due to the lax investigation standards, new issues may arise in the future. Today's released list still has discrepancies with the lists held by the media. The Komeito and Democratic Socialist Party also published lists of party members who received political donations today. Within the Liberal Democratic Party, opinions differ on whether to publish the list of party members who received political donations from the pachinko industry.

　　日本内阁调查证实
　　八阁员接受弹子房业巨额捐款
    本报东京10月20日电  记者于青报道：日本内阁今天发表的调查结果证实，内阁中8位成员共接受“弹子房”业政治捐款497万日元。
    日本内阁官房长官森山今天上午会见记者，根据一周前的许诺，公开发表了内阁成员接受“弹子房”业政治捐款的情况。其中包括海部首相45万日元、森山官房长官12万日元、中山外相106万日元、水野总务厅长官20万日元、渡部自治相30万日元、大石邮政相74万日元、石井国土厅长官30万日元。加上户井田厚生相自己发表的180万日元，8名内阁成员共497万日元。
    森山官房长官说，接受的政治捐款都是根据政治资金限制法适当处理的，因为没有问题，所有没有考虑退还。他还表示，为了不至出现差错，进行了反复的彻底调查。
    舆论认为，由于调查标准不严格，日后还可能出现新问题。今天发表的名单与新闻界手中的名单还有不相符之处。公明党和民社党今天也公布了该党议员接受政治捐款的名单，自民党内对是否公布该党议员接受“弹子房”业政治捐款名单意见不同。
