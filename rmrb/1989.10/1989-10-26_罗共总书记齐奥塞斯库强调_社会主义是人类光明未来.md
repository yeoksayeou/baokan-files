Romanian Communist Party General Secretary Ceaușescu emphasized in his speech at the enlarged plenary session of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee on October 24th, "Only socialism can be the bright future of happiness, freedom, and peace for all humanity."

The enlarged plenary session of the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee will discuss the ideological and political work of the Romanian Communist Party, market supply, and the preparations for the 14th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party.

In his speech, Ceaușescu also stressed that socialist countries have made tremendous achievements in eliminating backwardness and building socialism, "Socialism has become a great world force, indicating that the people of all countries can only ensure their independent and self-reliant economic and social development by taking this path, and can only ensure their own welfare and happiness."

Ceaușescu believes that at present, it is necessary to be vigilant against some Western countries using various forms of aid to strengthen capitalist forces within socialist countries, and ultimately eliminate the socialist system.

In discussing international issues, Ceaușescu said, "One cannot talk about abstract nations, but only about capitalist nations of the exploiting class and socialist nations of the workers and peasants, both of which have the mission to act to ensure the interests of the classes they represent;" "Nor can one equate bourgeois democracy with workers' revolutionary democracy."

He also said, "The imperialist bloc has exaggerated some of the shortcomings and mistakes of socialist countries, launching another round of ideological and political attacks to defame socialism, interfering in the internal affairs of socialist countries and disrupting their domestic situations."

　　罗共总书记齐奥塞斯库强调
　　社会主义是人类光明未来
    新华社布加勒斯特10月25日电　罗共总书记齐奥塞斯库24日在罗共中央扩大的全体会议上讲话时说：“只有社会主义才是全人类幸福、自由与和平的光明未来。”
    罗共中央这次扩大的全体会议将讨论罗共的思想政治工作、市场供应和罗共十四大筹备工作等问题。
    齐奥塞斯库在讲话中还强调，社会主义国家在铲除落后状态和建设社会主义方面取得了巨大成就，“社会主义已成为巨大的世界力量，它表明各国人民只有走这条路才能确保自己独立自立的经济社会发展，才能确保自己的福利和幸福”。
    齐奥塞斯库认为，当前应警惕一些西方国家通过各种形式的援助来加强社会主义国家内的资本主义势力，进而消除社会主义制度的图谋。
    齐奥塞斯库在谈到国际问题时说，“不能谈什么抽象国家，只能谈剥削阶级的资本主义国家和工农大众的社会主义国家，它们都有为确保它们各自代表的阶级利益而行动的使命”；“也不能在资产阶级民主和工人革命民主之间划等号”。
    他还说，“帝国主义集团夸大了社会主义国家的一些缺点和错误，再次发动了诽谤和中伤社会主义的意识形态和政治攻势，干涉社会主义国家内政和搅乱它们的国内局势”。
