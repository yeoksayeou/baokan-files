The elderly man splits the green bamboo into thin, fine strips and weaves them into baskets.

Youth flows away from the swift, splintering bamboo knife, flows away...

The towering mountains narrow the village, shortening the villagers' vision.

Above the mountain peak, an eagle soars through the sky, reflecting his restless heart.

His craftsmanship endures through hardship, quickly becoming proficient.

He weaves in the beauty of mountain flowers, the strength of mountain rocks, and the clarity of mountain streams...

Bamboo baskets and his name are scattered throughout the hundred-mile villages and hamlets.

During weddings and festivals, exquisite bamboo baskets carry others' joy and sweetness. He, however, finally calculates: when will he weave the last basket, to match his broken bowl and bamboo cane!

That year, the mountain's bamboo baskets were displayed in the exhibition hall, and he returned from the market with a modest prosperity. Isn't his craftsmanship like a seed? Once the harsh winter releases its grip and the frozen earth thaws, a factory will sprout! His craftsmanship has hundreds of replicas in the workshop. The village roads have widened. Across the vast ocean, a small mountain village in the southern country is held by a graceful blonde woman, delicate and beautiful.

Looking up, the mountain eagle transforms into a seagull, soaring, soaring...

    编竹篮子的老人
    张如腾
    把青竹破得薄薄的，细细的，编成一只只篮子。
    青春，从疾驶的破篾刀两边流去，流去……
    重重高山逼小了山村，逼短了山里人的视线。
    山顶之上，却有雄鹰凌空搏击，那是他一颗不安分的心。
    手艺在苦难里熬，很快就熬熟了。
    编进山花的美丽，编进山岩的坚固，编进山溪的晶莹……
    竹篮子、他的名字，一起撒遍百里大村小寨。
    恭贺嫁娶，喜过年节，精美的竹篮子盛别人的欢愉、甜蜜。他自己，却终于盘算：何时编结最后一只篮子，配那只破碗，配那根竹杖！
    那年，这山里的竹篮子登上展览馆的大雅之堂，他才从墟场上挑回个小康。他的手艺不就是一颗种子吗？严冬一旦开释，冻土一旦松活，就萌发出一座工厂！他的手艺在车间里有几百个翻版。山村的路宽了。大洋彼岸，南国这个小小山村拎在风度翩翩的金发女郎手上，精巧，美观。
    抬首望，山鹰化作海燕，翱翔，翱翔……
