Taiwan Province, as Part of China, Has No Right to Unilaterally Join the GATT

	BEIJING, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing today answered a reporter's question about Taiwan's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

	Li Zhaoxing pointed out that China is a founding contracting party to the GATT. The People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China, and Taiwan is a part of China. In October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to restore the People's Republic of China's lawful seat in the United Nations. In the same year, the GATT contracting parties' conference, in accordance with the above resolution, decided to cancel the "observer" status of the Taiwan authorities in the GATT. In July 1986, the government of the People's Republic of China formally applied to restore its status as a contracting party to the GATT. The GATT is currently working on this issue.

	At present, the first thing to be solved is the issue of China restoring its status as a contracting party to the GATT. Taiwan, as a province of China, has no right to unilaterally join the GATT. Taiwan can only participate in the GATT as a separate customs territory of China with the approval of the Chinese government. However, this can only be considered after the issue of China restoring its status as a contracting party to the GATT is resolved.

    台湾省作为中国的一部分  无权自行参加关贸总协定
    本报北京10月19日讯　记者顾玉清报道：中国外交部发言人李肇星今天在新闻发布会上，回答了记者关于台湾申请加入关税及贸易协定一事的提问。
    李肇星指出，中国是关贸总协定的创始缔约国。中华人民共和国是中国的唯一合法政府，台湾是中国的一部分。1971年10月，联合国大会通过决议，恢复了中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。同年，关贸总协定缔约国大会根据上述决议决定取消台湾当局在总协定的“观察员”资格。1986年7月，中华人民共和国政府正式提出恢复其关贸总协定缔约国地位的申请。总协定正在就此问题进行工作。
    目前，首先要解决的是中国恢复在关贸总协定缔约国地位问题。台湾作为中国的一个省无权自行参加总协定。台湾只有在征得中国政府同意后，才有作为中国的一个单独关税地区参加总协定的可能，但这只能在中国恢复在总协定缔约国地位问题解决后考虑。
