The original Yushan Forest Farm, located in the mountainous region of Zibo, Shandong, had its "royal rations" cut off in 1979—the state stopped providing subsidies, forcing the farm to fend for itself.

"How are we going to make a living from now on? Might as well pack up and leave!" The workers at the forest farm were buzzing with talk, and some were ready to roll up their bedding and head down the mountain.

"No, we must find a way out!" Manager Shang Yuweng called out at a staff meeting. "We must stand on our own feet, face society, and engage in diversified operations centered around forestry to shed the 'begging farm' label."

From that point on, the original Yushan Forest Farm began its attempts to break out of the forest area and venture into society. Their first project was to use three wooden lathes to make small items like rolling pins, garlic pounders, and knife handles from small materials.

The lathes started turning, and though the profits were small, they did see some returns. That year, they made 2,000 yuan. Though it was a small amount, it was the first money the original Yushan Forest Farm had ever earned since its establishment.

Next, they started a transportation service. The original Yushan Forest Farm's only asset was a horse-drawn carriage. They added a 12-horsepower small tractor to transport small loads for other units, earning some labor money. At that time, locals looked down on this mode of transport, calling it a "moth." But the drivers from the original Yushan Forest Farm drove it with gusto, and the money started rolling in, like a small family saving up, the more they saved, the more they wanted to save. With money in hand, the farm then started a new project—a wood processing factory. In 1980, the three small enterprises brought in a pure income of around 30,000 yuan. The amount might not have been large, but its significance was immense; morale and the team were stabilized.

The first step was successful, and their path widened. The Boshan Food Company's dairy farm had been losing money year after year, and most of the cows were sold, leaving 17 that hadn't been sold. Shang Yuweng took on this "burden" like a treasure. He thought: the farm has 40,000 mu of land, plenty of grass, why not start a dairy farm? The dairy farm was established, and in one year, it made nearly 100,000 yuan in profits. The next year, it made over 400,000 yuan. The cows became the farm's treasure. Now, the farm has 152 cows.

In the past, focusing solely on forestry led to increasing poverty; now, with diversified operations, the path is wider, and income is higher. The original Yushan Forest Farm tasted success and continued to advance to new heights.

One day, Shang Yuweng went to the city to gather market information. Seeing the people of Boshan going crazy over ceramics, producing, processing, wholesaling, peddling, and retailing, busy as bees, he was inspired. Boshan is one of the top five ceramic production bases in the country. One land, one people. Why don't we also try our hand at ceramics? He thoroughly understood the production and sales status of Boshan ceramics, saw the opportunity, and found a way in. He thought: Northern ceramics are rugged, Southern ceramics are delicate. If we combine these two styles and create new varieties, maybe we can stand our ground.

Shang Yuweng led a team to formulate a plan to produce "Yushan-style" ceramics, with the help of research institutions, built an electric tunnel kiln for glazing. The superiority of the electric tunnel kiln quickly showed: a coal-fired kiln takes 6 hours to fire a batch of ceramics, and the products are prone to deformation and breakage. The electric tunnel kiln only needs a few minutes, and there are no issues like deformation and breakage. From then on, the glazing technology of the original Yushan Forest Farm entered the forefront of the industry nationwide.

Next, the farm established the "State-owned Yushan Ceramics Wholesale Company," operating ceramics from all over the country, from Heilongjiang to Guangdong, their sales points are everywhere; 54 out of 80 second-level wholesale stations in Shandong Province source their goods from here. In this way, they gathered ceramics from all over the country and sold them nationwide, and the business grew bigger. In the ceramic business hub of Zibo, a small forest farm broke through, with over 1,000 varieties of products.

The original Yushan Forest Farm has navigated the sea of commodity economy for ten years. The once "begging farm" is now prosperous and wealthy. However, forestry is still the main business, and they have never neglected the 40,000 mu of trees.

Now, the farm invests 1.5 million yuan from its own accumulated funds into forestry production each year. This investment is more than twice the original state investment. Today, the original Yushan Forest Farm has been designated as a provincial-level nature reserve in Shandong. Here, there is the "National Juniper Model Forest" praised by national forestry experts, a collection area for excellent tree species, a thorny locust seed garden, and a determination forest for excellent types.

    靠擀面杖起家
    红星　清才
    1979年，地处山东淄博山区的原山林场断了“皇粮”——国家停止了拨款，让林场自己打食养活自己。
    “往后的日子怎么过哇，散摊子拉倒！”林场工人议论纷纷，有的准备打铺盖卷，下山去。
    “不，一定要冲出一条活路来！”场长尚玉文在职工大会上大声呼唤。“我们要立足林场，面向社会，搞以林为主的多种经营，摘掉‘要饭林场’的帽子”。
    从那时起，原山林场便开始了冲出林区，走向社会的尝试。他们办的第一个项目，就是依靠三台木旋床，用小材小料加工些小玩艺儿，如擀面杖、捣蒜槌子、菜刀把等。
    木旋床转起来了，小本小利，总算见了“回头钱”，当年赚了2000元。别看这小打小闹，还是原山林场建场以来挣来的第一笔钱哩。
    紧接着他们又搞起了运输。原山林场原来的家当是一部马车，他们又添置了一台12马力的小型拖拉机，承担外单位小宗货物的运输，挣个脚力钱。那时，当地老百姓对这种运输工具已瞧不起，称为“扑灯蛾”。但原山林场的司机们，还开得挺带劲，人民币也就隔三差五地往里进，活像小户人家攒钱，越攒越上瘾。有了钱，林场接着上了新项目——木材加工厂。1980年，三个小企业纯收入3万来元。数目虽不大，但意义可不小，人心、队伍都稳定了。
    第一步成功了，他们的路子越走越宽。博山食品公司奶牛场连年亏损，把奶牛大部分卖了，剩下17头没卖出去。尚玉文就把这“包袱”当宝贝似地接了下来。他想：林场4万亩地盘，牧草充足，办个奶牛场岂不占尽地利。奶牛场办起来了，一年下来竟盈利近1万元。第二年获利4万余元。奶牛成了林场的活宝贝。如今全场已有奶牛152头。
    过去单一搞林业，越搞越穷；现在多种经营，路子宽了，收入多了。原山林场尝到了甜头，继续向新台阶迈进。
    一天，尚玉文到城里去探听市场行情。看到博山人发疯似地搞陶瓷，生产、加工、批发、贩运、零售，忙得不亦乐乎，他受到启发。博山是全国五大陶瓷生产基地之一。一方水土，养一方人啊。我们何不也在陶瓷上打打主意？他详尽地了解了博山陶瓷生产、销售现状，看出了门道，找到了可乘之机。他想：北方陶瓷粗犷，南方陶瓷细腻，把这两种风格糅合到一起，搞新的品种，也许能站住脚。
    尚玉文领导一伙人制定了生产“原山型”陶瓷的方案，在科研部门的帮助下，建起了用于彩烤的电隧道窑炉。电隧道窑炉的优越性很快显示出来：用煤作燃料的窑炉烤一炉瓷器需要6小时，烤出的产品容易变型破碎。电隧道窑炉只需十几分钟，而且不会出现变型破碎等现象。从此原山林场的陶瓷彩烤工艺跨入全国同行业的先进行列。
    接着林场又办了一个“国营原山陶瓷批发公司”，经营全国各地陶瓷，从黑龙江到广东遍布他们的销售点；山东省80家二级批发站就有54家从这里进货。就这样，他们汇集了全国的陶瓷，又销往全国，买卖越做越大。在陶瓷厂商荟萃的淄博，一个小小的林场竟杀出阵来，经营品种达1000多种。
    原山林场在商品经济的大海中，闯荡了十年。当初那个“要饭林场”，如今家大业大，变富了。然而林业毕竟是主业，他们一刻也没放松对4万亩林木的关注。
    现在林场每年从自己积累的资金中拿出15万元投入营林生产。这笔投资相当于原先国家投资的两倍多。今天的原山林场已被确定为山东省省级自然保护区。这里，有被全国林业专家们叹为观止的“全国侧柏模式林”，有优良树种搜集区、刺槐种子园、优良类型测定林。
