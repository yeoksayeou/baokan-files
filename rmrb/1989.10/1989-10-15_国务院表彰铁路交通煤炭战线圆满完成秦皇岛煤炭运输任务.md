The State Council today issued a notice commending the railway, transportation, and coal industries for successfully completing the Qinhuangdao coal transportation task. The full text is as follows:

To the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Energy, and the People's Governments of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shanxi, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, and to all cadres and workers in the railway, transportation, and coal industries:

At a time when the entire nation is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are pleased to hear that the broad cadres and workers in the railway, transportation, and coal industries have overcome numerous difficulties, united and cooperated, tapped potential, and expanded capacity. They have completed the Qinhuangdao coal transportation task for two consecutive months, ahead of schedule meeting the State Council's requirement to store 60 million tons of coal for winter. The coal supply situation in various provinces and cities has also been alleviated, making a significant contribution to ensuring coal supply for industrial and agricultural production and people's livelihood this winter and next spring. This once again proves that the Chinese working class is indeed the main force in building socialist modernization. The State Council expresses its heartfelt thanks and warm greetings to you, and through you to all cadres, workers, and technical personnel in the railway, transportation, and coal industries. We commend the units and individuals who have made contributions in this coal transportation task.

Currently, energy and transportation remain the weak links in the national economy. To ensure the completion of this year's national economic production plan and lay a solid foundation for next year's production, we hope you will summarize your experiences, continue to implement the spirit of the Qinhuangdao on-site office meeting, strengthen leadership, unify command, strengthen dispatching, each take responsibility, cooperate closely, and work together to ensure the completion of the coal production and transportation tasks assigned by the state. We hope you will study Jiang Zemin's speech at the 40th anniversary celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China, further strengthen ideological and political work, care for the lives of workers, do a good job in safety production and winter preparation, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, and make new contributions to ensuring the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy!
