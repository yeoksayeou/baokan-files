English is becoming increasingly popular in the world today. Statistics show that 1.5 billion people can speak English. In Britain, the United States, and Commonwealth countries, approximately 320 million people have English as their mother tongue. In 63 countries, English is the official language or the first foreign language. Eighty percent of the text stored in computers worldwide is written in English, and sixty percent of scientists can read English professional literature. Pilots and navigators on international flights communicate in English. "Mastering English allows you to travel the world." The British have seen an opportunity to make money from this, and various English language schools have sprung up across the country. Currently, there are over 800 English language schools in Britain. On Oxford Street in London, you can see advertisements for English language schools everywhere: "Four-week intensive course for 130 pounds," "Three-month advanced course for 295 pounds." There are dozens of such schools near this street. People joke that "there are more English teachers on Oxford Street than pigeons in Trafalgar Square."

With so many teachers, students are naturally abundant. About 500,000 people come to Britain each year to study English, with the majority using their summer vacations to enroll in intensive courses. This summer alone, 250,000 foreigners signed up.

The prosperity of English language schools brings in a steady stream of foreign exchange earnings. The annual revenue from English language education is already 900 million pounds. The total income from operating English language schools abroad and holding English lectures is 625 million pounds, making it one of the largest foreign exchange-earning sectors in Britain's service industry.

    英语巧变英镑
    温振顺
    英语在当今世界日益流行。据统计，世界上十五亿人能讲英语。在英国、美国和英联邦国家约有三点二亿人的母语为英语，六十三个国家的官方语言或第一外语是英语。全世界电脑存储的文字百分之八十是用英文撰写的，百分之六十的科学家能阅读英文专业文献。国际航线的飞行员和领航员用英语对话。“学会英语可以走遍天下”。英国人从中看出生财之道，各种英语补习学校在英国各地应运而生。目前，英国各地设立了八百多所英语补习学校，在伦敦牛津大街上，到处可以看到英语补习学校的招生广告：“四星期速成班一百三十英镑，”
  “三个月高级班二百九十五英镑”，这条街附近就有几十所补习学校，人们比喻说，“牛津街的英语教师比特拉法尔加广场的鸽子还多。”
    老师多，学生当然也少不了。每年到英国学习英语的大约有五十万人，其中大多数人是利用暑假就读速成班，今年夏季就有二十五万外国人报名。
    英语补习学校的兴旺带来滚滚而来的外汇收入。英语补习业每年的营业额已达九亿英镑，英国在国外开办英语补习学校和举办英语讲座的总收入高达六十二点五亿英镑。成为英国服务行业较大的创汇部门之一。
