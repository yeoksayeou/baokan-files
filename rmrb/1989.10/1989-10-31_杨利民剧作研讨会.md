Recently, relevant units held a symposium in Beijing, where Yang Limin's realistic creative spirit, as well as the rich life atmosphere and intense emotional conflicts within his works, were fully affirmed. At the same time, the symposium also pointed out the shortcomings in his works.

　　杨利民剧作研讨会
    曾以创作话剧《黑色的石头》受到文坛关注的大庆工人作家杨利民最近又创作了话剧《大雪地》，此剧再现了某油田在初创时干部、职工的艰苦奋斗的创业精神和他们真实的思想感情。最近，有关单位在京联合举行了研讨会，会上充分肯定了杨利民的现实主义创作精神及作品中浓郁的生活气息和人物内心的强烈情感冲突，同时也指出其作品存在的不足。
