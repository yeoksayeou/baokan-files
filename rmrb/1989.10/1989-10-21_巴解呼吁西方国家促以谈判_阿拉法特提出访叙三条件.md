Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, October 17th.

The advisor to the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Abu Sherif, emphasized today at a press conference here that the PLO adheres to the resolutions of the 1988 Algiers conference and calls on the Federal Republic of Germany and other Western countries to urge Israel to negotiate with the PLO.

Abu Sherif said that the plan for resolving the Palestinian issue adopted by the Palestine National Council in Algiers in 1988 is a long-term solution. "We will abide by these resolutions." He emphasized that despite the increasing Israeli organized terrorist activities, the Palestinians are determined to continue resisting Israeli occupation.

He praised the Federal Republic of Germany's proposal to achieve peace on the basis of Palestinian self-determination and to allow the Palestinians to decide the form of their independence, and demanded that the European Community and the United Nations take steps to break Israel's blockade of Western aid to the PLO.

Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait, October 19th.

Palestinian President Arafat recently proposed three conditions for a visit to Syria.

According to today's report by Kuwait's Al-Anbaa newspaper, the three conditions are: Syria guarantees not to interfere in Palestinian internal affairs, releases 4,000 Palestinians detained in Syria, and agrees to receive Arafat with the courtesy due to a head of state.

The report said that these three conditions were proposed by Arafat at the PLO Central Committee meeting held this week in Baghdad.
