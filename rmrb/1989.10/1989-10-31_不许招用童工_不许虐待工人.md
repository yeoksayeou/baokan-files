The illegal operations of the "Self-Reliance Leather Factory" in Chengdu's Jinniu District Yongfeng Township, headed by Zhang Jian, involved deceiving and hiring child laborers, and brutally exploiting and beating workers. This shocking and infuriating behavior has drawn sharp criticism. Li Peng commented on this case, stating:

"In our socialist country, we must protect the physical and mental health of children and absolutely not allow such cruel exploitation and inhumane acts to occur." The public security authorities have now arrested Zhang Jian according to law. Although this is an isolated incident, the issues it raises should be of great concern to all sectors of society.

We are a socialist country, and the working class and all laborers are the masters of the state. Whether in state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises, or private enterprises, people only have different divisions of labor; their personal dignity is equal, with no distinction between high and low. The political status and legal rights of workers as masters cannot be changed or infringed upon. Zhang Jian's arbitrary beating and cursing of workers, even depriving them of personal freedom, is illegal and absolutely unacceptable.

Children are the future of the nation, and their interests should receive special protection. The "Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China" clearly stipulates: "It is forbidden for any organization or individual to employ school-age children and adolescents who should be receiving compulsory education." This is an important regulation. Zhang Jian disregarded national laws, deceiving and hiring child laborers, and even beating these underage children, which is absolutely unacceptable.

Our reform and opening up, adhering to the policy of a public ownership system as the mainstay and developing various economic components, is to better develop productive forces and fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. This does not mean that for personal gain, one can resort to any means and act recklessly. If someone takes advantage of the reform to try to get rich through illegal means such as hiring child labor and abusing workers, they are mistaken. Local party and government leaders and judicial authorities should take Zhang Jian's case as a lesson, seriously investigate whether there are similar situations in their regions; if there are, they must be resolutely stopped, and those who violate the law should be punished according to law.

### 不许招用童工  不许虐待工人

　　不许招用童工
　　不许虐待工人
    从事非法经营的成都市金牛区永丰乡“自力皮革厂”厂长周坚，骗招童工，肆意盘剥毒打工人的恶劣行径，触目惊心，令人愤慨。李鹏同志针对这件案子指出：
  “在我们社会主义国家，要保护儿童身心健康成长，绝不允许这种残酷剥削，惨无人道的事发生。”现在公安部门已将周坚依法逮捕。这虽然是个别的事例，但是它所反映的问题应引起社会各方面的高度重视。
    我们是社会主义国家，工人阶级和一切劳动者都是国家的主人。无论在国营企业、集体企业还是私营企业中，人们都只有分工的不同，人格一律平等，没有贵贱的区别。工人作为主人的政治地位和合法权益不容改变和剥夺。周坚任意打骂工人，甚至剥夺工人的人身自由，是违法的，是绝对不能容许的。
    儿童是国家的未来，他们的利益应受到特别的保护。《中华人民共和国义务教育法》明确规定：“禁止任何组织或者个人招用应该接受义务教育的适龄儿童、少年就业。”这是一项重要的法规。周坚无视国家法规，骗招童工，并毒打这些未成年的孩子，更是绝对不能容许的。
    我们搞改革开放，坚持以公有制为主体、发展多种经济成分的方针，是为了更好地发展生产力，充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性。这绝不意味着为了个人发财可以不择手段地肆意妄为。如果有人钻改革的空子，想通过招用童工、虐待工人等非法手段发大财，那就打错了算盘。各地党政领导和司法机关要以周坚一案为鉴戒，认真查一查本地区有无类似的情形；如果有，一定要坚决制止，并对触犯刑律者依法惩处。
