Recently, the Xiaoxita Town Tax Bureau inspected 456 individual taxpayers and recovered a total of 430,000 yuan in back taxes. Despite the large amount recovered, only 41% of the recovered taxes were actually deposited into the government's coffers, making the issue of tax arrears a serious problem.

In Xiaoxita Town, Yanjiagang Village, the precast concrete processing specialist Si Wenhu has been delinquent on taxes amounting to 7,148.93 yuan since before 1988. The tax authorities decided to impose a late payment penalty of 3,252.34 yuan, making the total amount due over 10,000 yuan, which he has yet to pay. During this tax inspection, it was discovered that he still owes an additional 5,750.65 yuan in taxes, but he has paid no heed to the tax authorities' inspections.

The owner of the Xinxing Restaurant in Xiaoxita Town, Xiong Mei, has evaded paying taxes amounting to over 350,000 yuan over the past year. Due to several state-owned and collective enterprises dining at his restaurant without paying, accumulating a debt of over 3,000 yuan, he has used this as an excuse to delay paying his taxes.

Since early August, numerous individuals have visited the town tax bureau to plead on behalf of taxpayers. Sometimes, the tax bureau receives over 20 visitors in a day, with an average of at least 10 visitors per day. Various levels of officials frequently visit the tax bureau, and most of those who plead are their relatives and friends.

Due to the large number of interveners, the normal work of the tax bureau has been disrupted, affecting the progress and quality of the individual tax inspections.

　　说情者止步
    拖欠者补款
    最近，小溪塔镇税务所检查了456户个体纳税人，共查补税款43万多元。尽管查补数额大，但是入库税款金额却只占查补税款的41％，拖欠税款问题已成为一个严重的问题。
    小溪塔镇鄢家河村水泥预制加工专业户司文虎，1988年前就拖欠税款7148.93元，当时税务部门决定对他加收滞纳金3252.34元，合计1万多元，这笔税款他一直未交。这次税收大检查中我们发现他还要补税款5750.65元，但他对税务机关的检查不理不睬。
    小溪塔镇新星酒家老板熊美，一年多偷漏税款3.5万多元。由于一些国营和集体单位在他的酒家多次吃饭不给钱，拖欠饭钱达3000多元，他就以此为借口拖欠税款。
    从8月初以来，到镇税务所为纳税人说情者众多，有时，税务所一天接待说情者20多人次，平均每天至少也有10人次，各级官员不时也来税务所光顾，被说情者大多是他们的亲戚朋友。
    由于说情者众多，打乱了税务所的正常工作，影响了个体税收检查的进度和质量。
