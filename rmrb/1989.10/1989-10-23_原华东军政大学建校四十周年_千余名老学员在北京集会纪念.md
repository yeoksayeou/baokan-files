This morning, over 1,000 alumni of the former East China Military and Political University gathered in Beijing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the university and the 40th anniversary of Comrade Chen Yi's speech "Serving the People."

Forty years ago, in 1949, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong made the decision to train cadres of the People's Liberation Army who were in the midst of frequent combat. In October, the East China Military and Political University, with Chen Yi serving as both the president and political commissar, officially began classes in Nanjing. At the opening ceremony, Chen Yi delivered a lengthy speech titled "Serving the People."

The former vice president of the East China Military and Political University, General Chen Shiqian, the former vice political commissar, General Zhong Qiguang, and Chen Yi's son, Chen Haosu, attended today's commemorative meeting.
