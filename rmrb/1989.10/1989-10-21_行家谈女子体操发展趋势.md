At the World Gymnastics Championships, the reporter "hired" Chinese international judge Lu Enchun as a technical consultant for the newspaper. He commented as he watched, with witty remarks.

He said that the landscape of women's gymnastics has slightly changed. Although the Soviet Union and Romania are still absolutely dominant, the Romanian team shows signs of decline. Silivas and Dobre have both gained weight, and Silivas' floor exercise, although still scoring 10 points, is of lower quality compared to the 1987 Rotterdam Games and the 1988 Olympics. It is merely "still charming as ever."

The Soviet Union's advantage is its abundance of young talent. A new batch of athletes can immediately become world-class. The United States has new faces, strong in strength, full of vitality, with high difficulty in movements, but the old problem of instability on the balance beam has not been overcome. Bulgaria and East Germany, which were previously good, have been pushed down by the Chinese and American teams this time. The East German team is in the process of changing guards, and their results are not ideal.

Additionally, gymnastics is becoming increasingly popular. Teams that were previously unknown, such as Spain, Australia, and Belgium, have achieved good results. Even regions like Puerto Rico can form teams to participate in competitions. Some world-class athletes' routines can now be performed by athletes of average level.

Thirdly, difficulty is still increasing. This year is the first major competition since the new rules were implemented. According to past practices, there will be no technical surprises. This time, looking at the events, the uneven bars have seen significant changes, while the others have not changed much.

　　行家谈女子体操发展趋势
　　本报记者　江建国
    世界体操锦标赛上，记者“聘请”中国国际裁判陆恩淳担任本报的“技术顾问”。他边看边议，妙语连珠。
    他说，女子体操格局稍有变化。苏联和罗马尼亚队虽然仍绝对领先，但罗马尼亚队已呈现后退迹象。西里瓦斯和多布雷两人已经发胖了，西里瓦斯自由体操虽然还是10分，但质量比1987年鹿特丹大赛和1988年奥运会差了，只是
  “风韵不减当年”。苏联的优势是后备人才多，出一批新手就是世界级。美国换了新人，实力很强，有生气，动作难度大，没有克服的老毛病是平衡木不稳。保加利亚和民主德国本来不错，这次被中、美两队挤下去了。民主德国队正在换班，成绩不理想。
    此外，体操运动在日益普及。过去名不见经传的队伍如西班牙、澳大利亚和比利时都获得较好名次，像波多黎各这样的地区都能组队参加比赛了。一些世界级运动员的动作现在连中等水平的运动员也能做出来了。
    第三，难度还在发展。今年是新规则通过后第一次大赛，按以往惯例不会产生技术冷门。这次从项目来看，高低杠变化大，其他无大变化。　（本报斯图加特10月20日电）
