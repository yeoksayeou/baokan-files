The flying arrows stir his heart. This is a snapshot of Xu Kaitai, the head coach of the Chinese archery team, at the target range during the Sixth Asian Cup Archery Competition. The arrows on the grass targets tug at his heartstrings, serving as a barometer of performance and a scale for the competition among athletes from various countries. With the whizzing sound of arrows, he clearly sees that the South Korean team is leading by a significant margin. After the first three distances, their score is 66 rings ahead of the Chinese men's team and 73 rings ahead of the Chinese women's team. The team from Chinese Taipei has also surged ahead, taking the second position.

The grim situation has wiped the smile off the face of this usually cheerful coach, but the seasoned veteran, who has weathered countless storms on the field, remains composed and in command. He walks over to each of the Chinese athletes' targets, letting the team see their "commander," thereby boosting their confidence and steadfastness. During the team's rest period, he softly reassures them, advising them not to get anxious and to focus on the techniques, avoiding any distractions. He also gives the athletes massages. There are no complaints to be heard, and no signs of low spirits. A team that loses is not to be feared; what matters is the spirit, the determination, and the ability to fight tough battles. At this moment, the Chinese team, despite being behind in points, demonstrates exactly this spirit.

It is known that the Chinese archery team is in the midst of a transition from old to new. The legendary archer Ma Xiangjun has become a mother and is now in Qingdao taking care of her child. Several other key players have also left the team. Currently, the team's star archers are still in the process of growing, appearing somewhat inexperienced. For instance, Ding Yi was just sent to compete in the National Youth Games. The decline in performance during a transition from old to new is a common phenomenon and is difficult to reverse. Xu Kaitai, of course, has long considered this rule, which is why he can remain so composed on the field today. However, this is only one aspect; he is not passively accepting the decline in performance but is instead seeking ways to quickly overcome this low point. He meticulously observes the techniques of the South Korean and Chinese Taipei athletes, not missing a single detail, even during their pre- and post-match relaxation exercises. He sees the competition as a valuable learning opportunity. Those who are good at learning will not fall behind.

    飞箭牵动他的心
    ——记徐开才总教练在靶场
    他脸晒得黝黑，右手不停地举起望远镜，观察前方的草靶。这就是中国射箭队总教练徐开才在第六届亚洲杯射箭赛靶场上的一个镜头。草靶上一支支箭牵动他的心，那是成绩的晴雨表，是各国选手较量的天平。随着嗖嗖的箭声，他清楚地看到，南朝鲜队的成绩已遥遥领先，前3个距离射完该队已多出中国男队66环，超过中国女队73环。中国台北队也跃到前面，居第二位。
    严峻的形势，虽然抹去了这位开朗教练脸上的笑容，但是，这个经历过无数次赛场风雨的山东大汉却不失大将风度，镇定自若地指挥战斗。他走近中国选手各个靶位，使队员看到自己的“指挥官”，从而坚定信心，稳住阵脚。队员休息时，他轻声地安抚，劝大家不要急躁，多体会动作要领，切勿分散精力。他还给队员按摩……这里听不见埋怨的声音，看不见低落的情绪。一个队伍输不怕，要的是作风，要的是志气，要的是能打恶仗。此刻，中国队在环数落后时，表现的就是这种精神。
    人们知道，中国射箭队正处在新老交替时，名将马湘君已做妈妈，在青岛带孩子，还有几名战将也先后离去。眼下，队中神射手还未成长起来，显得幼嫩，像丁毅是刚参加完全国青运会被派出场的。新老交替成绩下降是个普遍现象，难以扭转。对于这个规律，徐开才当然早已考虑过，所以今天靶场上他才能这样镇定。但是这仅仅是一面，他不是消极对待成绩下降，而是想法早日冲出这个低谷。他十分认真地观察南朝鲜队和中国台北队选手的技术，哪怕是赛前赛后做放松动作也不放过，一点一滴地吸取别人的长处，把比赛当作一次学习的好机会。善于学习的人是不会落后的。
