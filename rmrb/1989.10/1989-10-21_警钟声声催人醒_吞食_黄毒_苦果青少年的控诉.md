	The Alarm Bells Ring to Awaken People
	– The Protest of Youths Who Have Suffered from "Yellow Poison"
	Xinxing  Jiangxue

	Pornographic books and yellow videos are the "spiritual drugs" that corrupt young people. They are like poisoned arrows, aimed at the innocent young, poisoning their minds, destroying their willpower, and pushing them into the abyss of degradation and crime!

	Let's listen to a young person's protest:

	"I am a child with musical talent. When I was 4 years old, my parents found a teacher to teach me how to play percussion. When I was just beginning to understand things, I aspired to be a musician. Later, I was admitted to a music academy's affiliated middle school. I practiced hard, even injuring the tendons in my wrists.

	"Just as I was striving towards my goal, I was seduced by pornographic novels and lost my ideals and aspirations, becoming addicted to the yellow tide and unable to extricate myself. I quickly fell into the path of crime. I hate myself, and I hate those who used bad books to harm me. I want to ask them: You can't, for the sake of money, destroy us without a second thought!"

	Sitting in front of us is a middle school student who still has a childlike appearance. If it weren't for the fact that he is inside the high walls of a juvenile detention center, wearing a blue "custodial uniform," we would never believe that he is a juvenile rapist. He is only 16 years old. Two years ago, he only read a pornographic novel, and in a few days, he went from a promising young musician to a criminal. He appeals: "Children of my age want to read all kinds of books. A little push can make them progress, and a little push can make them sink. Hurry up and ban those evil pornographic books and save us!"

	The current large-scale "yellow sweep" is a virtuous deed that reflects the will of the people and is not only supported by all sectors of society but also reflects the demands of many young people who have been harmed by "yellow poison."

	Let's hear another girl's protest and appeal:

	"I was an excellent student and a member of the Young Pioneers when I was in elementary school. Later, I developed a strong interest in sports and was admitted to a sports school after graduating from elementary school. After diligent study and training, I achieved excellent results in the girls' short-distance running events. My parents and teachers had great hopes for me, and I also hoped to become an outstanding athlete, win gold medals at the Olympics, and bring glory to my country. At that time, I looked down on some classmates who spent a lot of time making friends and dating, thinking they were worthless, and even blamed the school for not managing them.

	"But I never expected that pornographic books would corrupt my mind, making me abandon my ideals and turn from a child with ideals and a future into a criminal. When I was 15, someone lent me a pornographic novel. At first, I was curious and flipped through it, but soon I became addicted. I wanted to read more and borrowed others. My mind was full of the descriptions of men and women in the books, and I lost interest in studying and training. The coach's lectures, I couldn't listen to them at all, and I no longer wanted to be friends with those classmates who had strong aspirations. I only hung out with those bad boys. In the end, I lost my innocence and became a criminal, sent to a labor reform camp.

	"My mental wounds were completely left by pornographic books; my country does not want me to be like this, my parents and teachers do not want me to be like this, and I do not want to be like this either. I am full of regret and hatred..."

	When talking about the harm of pornographic books and yellow videos to young people, several officials from the Beijing Public Security Bureau and Chaoyang District Vocational School, who have long been engaged in "yellow sweeps" and juvenile rehabilitation work, said that pornographic books and yellow videos have become a major public harm that induces crime and disrupts social stability. They said that the harm of pornographic books and yellow videos to young people is particularly serious and summarized the following three characteristics:

	First, they cause addiction quickly. Young people are in the stage of puberty, and pornographic books and yellow videos will give them strong "sexual harassment" and "sexual stimulation," from curiosity to addiction, from being fascinated by the pornographic descriptions in the books to having an urgent desire to imitate, and then losing self-control. Some people, in just a few days, or even after reading one book or watching one video, go from a good young person to someone without shame and willing to degrade themselves or commit crimes. Many habitual criminals who seduce and lure young people use pornographic books and yellow videos as bait to make naive and ignorant young people fall into the trap.

	Second, they are highly toxic. Sexual crimes are very likely to lead to other serious crimes. Young men who are severely addicted often imitate the descriptions and actions in pornographic books and yellow videos, using brutal methods without regard for means or consequences to treat the victims, thus triggering assault or murder. Some, in order to pay for the "expenses" of satisfying their sexual desires, take risks to steal and rob; for the sake of competing for the opposite sex, they fight and injure others, even kill, and go further and further down the path of crime.

	Third, they cause deep harm. Among juvenile criminals, there are two bad habits that are the hardest to change: stealing and sexual crimes. Many severely addicted young people, from first-time offenders to repeat offenders, from repeat offenders to habitual offenders, in and out of vocational schools and juvenile detention centers, step by step, until they are locked up in prison and subjected to legal punishment. According to a follow-up survey by a vocational school, out of more than 100 female juvenile sex offenders admitted by the school in recent years, only about 10% remained law-abiding and did not reoffend after leaving school. More often, they found it difficult to change their bad habits after leaving school, relapsed, and even committed more heinous crimes than their "previous offenses."

	Those young people who have suffered and have some regrets about the harm of pornographic books and yellow videos have a deeper understanding:

	"After reading pornographic novels, it's like being bitten by a poisonous snake, and the poison quickly spreads throughout the body. The advice of parents and teachers, the warnings of the public security bureau, the majesty of the law, personal dignity, and social morality, all are forgotten, and it's like being crazy and losing reason, suddenly becoming another person."

	"Pornographic books and yellow videos are indeed the 'spiritual opium' that poisons our minds. After I became addicted, I had no ambition, no ideals, no morality, not even the slightest sense of shame. Even if I didn't degrade myself or commit crimes, I wouldn't study hard, work hard, or be a good person..."

	"I am a victim of yellow videos and also a person who used yellow videos to harm others. I am too deeply addicted. Those who have watched yellow videos, some have degraded themselves, some have committed rape, and I myself have become a shameful criminal. We were all good students, but yellow videos have destroyed us. Yellow videos are indeed a knife that kills without blood!"

	This is the exposure and protest from the hearts of several juvenile rehabilitation offenders.

	The crimes of pornographic books and yellow videos are countless. However, in recent years, this point has not been truly recognized by many kind-hearted people, and the ban is not strict. Some people, for the sake of money, continue to write, translate, publish, and sell pornographic books. There are also a few bad people who, regardless of the law, continue to harm people without restraint.

	Materials provided by relevant departments indicate: In recent years, pornographic publications have gradually upgraded from handwritten copies to printed materials, from illegal publications to "legal" publications, and have been banned repeatedly without success. In Beijing and many large and medium-sized cities, individual bookstalls and book kiosks have an endless supply of pornographic and pornographic-content books, with some bookstalls and book kiosks having up to 90% of these bad books. Even state-owned Xinhua Bookstores openly display and sell these bad books in their windows and counters without hesitation.

	At the same time, in recent years, the crimes induced by pornographic books and yellow videos have been on the rise. According to a survey in Wuhan, due to the temptation of pornographic books and yellow videos, the crime rate among young people in the city has been rising, with sexual crime offenders accounting for about 40% of the juvenile labor reformers. In the national vocational school system, 95% of the female students are involved in sexual offenses. Among them, about 30% are directly harmed by pornographic books and yellow videos. Another 30% of those with "previous offenses" have committed even more heinous crimes after watching pornographic books and yellow videos.

	Kind-hearted people, innocent and pure young people, wake up!

	We also want to make the following appeal:

	Parents and teachers, in order to prevent children and students from having accidents, often remind them: "Be careful when taking the car, riding a bike," "Be careful of being stolen, being robbed," "Be careful of falling and hurting yourself." This is not enough, and you should remind them more: "Never read pornographic books and watch yellow videos!" Families also need to have a "yellow sweep out" and clean up the bookshelves, bedside table drawers, and under the pillows, and never keep those books that poison the minds of children.

	Innocent and pure young people, the previous missteps of a few victims are a warning to you. Pornographic books and yellow videos are epidemics, poisonous snakes, and knives that kill without blood. You must be careful!

　　警钟声声催人醒
　　——吞食“黄毒”苦果青少年的控诉

    淫秽书刊和黄色录像，是腐蚀青少年的“精神毒品”。它像一支支毒箭，刺向年幼无知的青少年，毒害他们的心灵，摧垮他们的意志，把他们推向堕落和犯罪的深渊！
    请看一个少年的控诉：
    “我是一个有音乐天赋的孩子。4岁时，父母就找教师教我学习打击乐了。我刚刚懂事的时候，就向往着当一名音乐家，后来我考上了一个音乐学院的附属中学。我拚命练，练得手腕上的韧带都受伤了。
    “正在我向着理想冲刺的时候，我被淫秽小说给麻醉了，不再有理想和追求，沉溺于黄色浊流而不能自拔，很快就走上了犯罪的道路。我恨自己，更恨那些用坏书害我的人。我要责问他们：你们不能为了赚钱，不惜把我们毁了！……”
    面对我们坐着的，是一个稚气犹存的中学生。要不是他在少管所的高墙之内，身穿蓝色的“管教服”，我们真不敢相信他会是一个少年强奸犯。他今年才16岁，两年前只因看了一本淫秽小说，几天的时间就从一个很有希望的音乐人才堕落为罪犯。他呼吁：“像我这种年龄的孩子，什么书都想看。拉一把就能上进，推一把就会下水，赶快查禁那些万恶的淫秽书刊，救救我们吧！”
    当前大规模的“扫黄”堪称察民情、顺民心的功德之举，不仅得到社会各界的拥护，也反映了许多深受“黄毒”之害的青少年的要求。
    请再听听一名少女的控诉和呼吁吧：
    “我上小学时，是一个品学兼优的少先队员。后来我对体育产生了浓厚的兴趣，小学毕业后考上了体校。经过勤学苦练，我在少年女子短跑运动项目上取得了优异的成绩。家长和老师都对我寄予很大的希望，我自己也盼望着长大后当一名出色的运动员，到奥运会上去拿金牌，为祖国争光。当时，我对有的同学花很多时间交朋友、谈恋爱很看不惯，认为他们没出息，还怪学校不管管他们呢。
      “可是万万没有想到，淫秽书刊腐蚀了我的心灵，使我放弃了对于理想的追求，从一个有理想、有前途的孩子变成了罪犯。15岁时，有人借给了我一本淫秽小说。开始，我觉得好奇而翻一翻，读着读着我很快就入迷了。我还想看，又去借别的，看得脑子里全都是书里描写的那些男女之间的事情，我对学习和锻炼都不感兴趣了。教练讲课，我根本听不进去，也不再愿意和那些上进心强的同学交朋友，尽和那些坏男孩子混在一起。最后我失了身，直至成为一名罪犯，被送进了劳教所。
      “我心灵上的伤口，完全是淫秽书刊给留下的；祖国不希望我这样，父母和教师不希望我这样，我自己也不希望这样。我又悔又恨……”
    谈到淫秽书刊和黄色录像对于青少年的毒害，北京市公安局和朝阳区工读学校的几位长期从事“扫黄”和青少年管教工作的干部说，淫秽书刊和黄色录像已成为诱发犯罪和破坏社会安定的一大公害。他们说，淫秽书刊和黄色录像对青少年的毒害尤为严重，并归纳了以下三个特点：
    一是中毒快。青少年处在青春萌发期，淫秽书刊和黄色录像会使他们受到强烈的“性骚扰”和“性刺激”，由好奇到入迷，从迷恋书中的淫秽描写，到产生迫切的模仿欲，进而失去自我克制能力。有的人在几天之内，甚至在读完一本书、看完一次录像后，就从一个好端端的青少年，变得毫无羞耻之心而自甘堕落或走向犯罪。许多教唆和引诱青少年的惯犯，就是以淫秽书刊和黄色录像为诱饵，使幼稚无知的青少年一举上钩的。
    二是毒性烈。性犯罪极易引发其它严重罪行。中毒严重的男性青少年，常常摹仿淫秽书刊和黄色录像中的描写和动作，不择手段、不计后果地使用暴虐手段对待受害的女性，从而引发伤害罪或杀人罪。也有的为了支付满足性欲的“开销”，铤而走险，去偷，去抢；为争夺异性，而打架斗殴，伤害他人甚至杀人，在犯罪的歧路上越走越远。
    三是毒害深。青少年犯罪分子中有两种恶习最难改掉，一种是偷，一种就是性犯罪。不少中毒严重的青少年，初犯变成屡犯，屡犯变成惯犯，工读学校、少年管教所屡出屡进，步步升级，直至被关进监狱，受到法律的制裁。据一所工读学校的跟踪调查，该校前几年收容的100多名女少年性罪犯中，出校后安分守己、不再重新犯罪的仅占10％左右。更多的是出校后恶习改难，旧病复发，甚至反而犯下比“前科”更为恶劣的罪行。
    那些吞食苦果后有所悔悟的受害青少年，对淫秽书刊和黄色录像的毒害，体会尤深：
      “看了淫秽小说，就像被毒蛇咬了一样，毒液很快传遍全身。家长和教师的劝导，公安局的警告，法律的威严，人格和社会公德，什么都不顾了，简直像疯了一样失去理智，一下子变成了另外一个人。”
      “淫秽书刊和黄色录像确确实实是毒害我们心灵的‘精神鸦片’。我入迷后，什么上进心啊，理想啊，道德啊，都没有了，连起码的羞耻心也没有了。就算是不堕落，不犯罪，也不会去好好学习，好好工作，好好做人……”
      “我是黄色录像的受害者，又是用黄色录像去害人的人。我中毒太深了，看过黄色录像的人，有的堕落了，有的犯了强奸罪，我自己也成了可耻的罪犯。我们原来都是不错的中学生哪，是黄色录像毁了我们。黄色录像真是一把杀人不见血的刀啊！”
    这就是几名少年管教犯出自内心的揭露和控诉。
    淫秽书刊和黄色录像的罪行罄竹难书。然而，这些年来，这一点还没有真正被许许多多善良的人们所认识，查禁不坚决。有的人为了赚钱，还在继续编写、翻译、出版、出售淫秽书刊。也还有极少数坏人，置法律于不顾，仍然肆无忌惮地用它害人。
    有关部门提供的材料表明：这些年来，淫秽读物从手抄本到印刷品，从非法出版物到“合法”出版物，逐步升级，屡禁不止。北京和许多大、中城市的个体书摊、书亭里，淫秽的和有淫秽内容的书刊层出不穷，有的书摊和书亭，这种坏书占到了90％以上。甚至国营的新华书店，也毫无顾忌地在橱窗、柜台里摆出这类坏书，公开出售。
    与此同时，这几年淫秽书刊和黄色录像引发的犯罪明显上升。据武汉市的调查，因淫秽书刊和黄色录像的诱惑，全市青少年犯罪率不断上升，其中性犯罪的青少年占劳教青少年的40％左右。在全国工读学校系统的女生中，95％的人属性罪错。其中30％左右的人，是淫秽书刊和黄色录像的直接受害者。另有30％左右有“前科”的人，看了淫秽书刊和黄色录像后，变本加厉犯下了更为恶劣的罪行。
    善良的人们，天真纯洁的青少年们，猛醒吧！
    我们还要发出这样的呼吁：
    家长和教师们为了防止孩子和学生们发生意外伤害事故，常常叮咛他们：“乘车、骑车要小心”，“小心被偷、被抢”，“小心跌伤、摔伤”。这还不够，还要更多地叮咛他们：“千万不要去读淫秽书刊和看黄色录像！”家庭也有必要来一次“扫黄出门”，书架上，床头柜的抽屉里，枕头下，赶快清一清，千万不要留存那些毒害子女心灵的“黄书”。
    天真纯洁的青少年们，前面几位受害青少年的失足行为，是你们的前车之鉴。淫秽书刊和黄色录像是瘟疫，是毒蛇，是杀人不见血的刀子，你们可千万要小心啊！
