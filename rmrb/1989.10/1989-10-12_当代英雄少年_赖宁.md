On March 13, 1988, a 14-year-old junior high school student fell in the mountains of his beloved hometown. A forest fire was extinguished, and his body lay surrounded by wisps of rising smoke...

Four days later, a grand funeral was held for him, attended by over 3,000 people. The elders said that this was the most solemn funeral in the history of Shiyan County, Sichuan Province.

The mountains of the Hengduan Range reach the clouds, and the Dadu River weeps. Silent tears and deep affection are all offered to this heroic boy...

Books gave him the wings of his dreams

Lai Ning lived in the town of Xinmian, Shiyan County, Sichuan Province, surrounded by mountains. However, the remote and closed environment did not hinder Lai Ning's vision. In the third grade of primary school, Lai Ning won the first prize in the Sichuan Province Little Red Flag Reading and Newspaper Reading Competition. Books broadened his horizons.

On his birthdays or holidays, when his parents asked him what gift he wanted, he always said, "Books!" Among his belongings, the most numerous were books. He loved reading "Li Siguang" the most, and he didn't know how many times he had read it. Several neighbors said that Lai Ning often went to their homes to read, and he would read for half a day at a time.

Lai Ning admired outstanding figures from ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign. In a Young Pioneers squad meeting, many male members hoped to become officers when they grew up. Lai Ning said, "I want to be like Li Siguang and become a geologist!" Someone reminded him, "Being a geologist is both hard and dangerous!" He shrugged his shoulders and seemed unconcerned. The teacher asked him why he wanted to be a geologist, and he said, "Our place is full of mountains. Haven't we already discovered many asbestos mines? There must be other treasures, and I want to find them and contribute them to the motherland!"

During a class outing, Lai Ning picked up a bag full of stones and picked out one to ask the teacher, "Is this the kind of green stone you mentioned when you talked about Li Siguang?"

Adventure was his great love

Lai Ning's father, Lai Zhenggang, had four brothers, and Lai Ning was the only boy among their children. Therefore, the whole family treated Lai Ning like a jewel. But Lai Ning did not want to be a weak child.

"I often use my spare time or holidays to climb rugged mountains, conquer steep cliffs, and engage in adventurous activities. Relying on my good luck, I have escaped death several times, but I love adventure even more. By the fifth grade, adventure had become my hobby. But my parents' information was very timely, and they often gave me ideological education. My parents' opposition and my insistence made my character more stubborn." This is a passage from Lai Ning's "My Little Biography."

Lai Ning knew very well that without the courage and skills of an adventurer, one could not become an outstanding geologist. Therefore, he often engaged in adventurous training, climbing mountains and collecting mineral specimens. He also donated a set of mineral specimens to his alma mater, Xinmian Primary School.

Mr. Chen from Xinmian Primary School recounted a surprising incident: "In the sixth grade, I talked about the importance of observation in writing good compositions in class. Who would have thought that Lai Ning decided to write an essay titled 'Poking a Wasp Nest' and actually went to do the experiment! According to what he told me later, he climbed a tree and used a stick to vigorously poke the wasp nest. The wasps swarmed and stung him. But he did not run away; he only used a thick piece of clothing to cover his head, leaving his eyes exposed to carefully observe. His essay was thrilling."

Not long before his sacrifice, he specially bought a blue plastic notebook and wrote down his plan for further adventures:

	Call sign: Gold Dragon Team, abbreviated JLD, secret code X;
	Date: Born on August 1, 1987;
	Location: The team operates in Shiyan County, Sichuan Province;
	Members: Currently, there is only 1 person (a maximum of 3 people) participating in the team;
	Purpose: To develop modern science and technology, to promote the spirit of adventure, to seek treasures from nature and unveil its mysteries.

Since Lai Ning was always excellent in both academics and conduct, he was awarded the title of "Three Good Student" and "Excellent Young Pioneer" every year during his primary school years. When he graduated from primary school, the school decided to recommend him to junior high school, but he insisted on taking the exam and entered the provincial key school, Shiyan County Middle School, with the first place in Xinmian Town. He knew that doing big things starts with doing small things.

Never giving up is Lai Ning's distinct personality trait.

He competed in an arm-wrestling match with a classmate and lost. From then on, he carried a 20-kilogram iron bucket every day to train his arm strength and grip. Half a month later, he challenged the previous winner again, and this time the winner lost without a chance to retaliate.

However, Lai Ning, who had just entered junior high school, did not make the list for the "Three Good Student" selection!

When talking about this incident, Lai Ning's teachers and classmates could not help but feel deeply moved. At that time, the class discipline was a bit chaotic, and the class teacher asked the class monitor, Lai Ning, to record the names of classmates who violated the rules. Although Lai Ning was "courteous and firm," this was still an unpopular task. As a result, Lai Ning, who was the first candidate, did not get enough votes in his first and last "Three Good Student" selection in junior high school. Many classmates felt sorry for Lai Ning. But he himself seemed as if nothing had happened. He not only excelled in his studies but also cared deeply for the collective, helped others, and was also the winner of the second prize in the Yaan Region Children's Painting Competition and the first prize in the county's Youth Calligraphy Competition.

He loved his hometown's mountains and rivers

The Shiyanni Mountain area is a Class I fire hazard area in Sichuan Province.

When Lai Ning was in primary school, he went up the mountain to fight fires three times. He did these things without writing about them or telling anyone. It was only when the forestry department sent a letter of commendation to the school that the teachers found out.

At around 15:30 on March 13, 1988, a fire broke out in the mountains near the county seat due to a short circuit in the power lines. The fire, fanned by the wind, quickly turned the mountains into a sea of flames. A large area of state-owned forests and the county's television satellite transmission station and oil company's oil depot were all in grave danger.

It was a Sunday afternoon. Lai Ning's father was designing a hydroelectric power station plan in the office while sick, and his mother was lying in bed with a headache. Lai Ning finished his homework and said, "I'm going downstairs for a walk." His mother struggled to open her eyes and specially reminded him, "It's windy outside, don't go far!"

After going downstairs, Lai Ning saw the sky-high flames at a glance. He didn't even have time to tell his mother and rushed straight to the fire scene.

His classmates Wang Hai and Zhou Wei, who fought the fire with him, recalled that when they met Lai Ning on the mountain, he was waving a pine branch and fighting the fire vigorously. The flames, reaching tens of meters high, raged and leaped. Lai Ning and his comrades bravely and tenaciously charged into the fire sea time and time again.

The county leaders directing the fire-fighting on the spot saw that it was already late and ordered the students, women, and elderly who participated in the fire-fighting to be forcibly taken down the mountain by car. Lai Ning, Zhou Wei, Wang Hai, and other classmates were also pulled onto the car. Someone on the car regretted, "Sigh, we won't be able to watch the TV drama 'Return to the Fire Mountain' tonight." Lai Ning, however, said humorously, "Then we'll go to the fire mountain again!" Everyone on the car laughed.

Suddenly, the flames below surged up again. Lai Ning saw this and immediately jumped off the car. Wang Hai and Zhou Wei also rushed up, and the three of them fought the fire together. When the firefighters pushed Zhou Wei and Wang Hai back onto the car again, they could not find Lai Ning. It was dark and the mountain was vast, and the firefighters continued to search while fighting the fire.

The fire was finally extinguished. More than 3,500 acres of state-owned forests were saved, and the county's television satellite transmission station and the oil company's oil depot were safe. However, at 9:00 AM on the 14th, people found Lai Ning's body in the burned forest on the south slope of Haizi Mountain, where the fire was the most intense the night before: his right arm was tightly wrapped around a small pine tree, his forehead rested on the slope, his glasses were lost, his left hand was propping up the ground, and his right leg was still in the posture of climbing up...

We do not advocate that young children participate in extinguishing forest fires. The "Forest Fire Prevention Regulations" clearly stipulate: "In the extinguishing of forest fires, disabled persons, pregnant women, and children shall not be mobilized." However, Lai Ning, with a sense of high responsibility, voluntarily joined the battle to save the state and collective property, and his spirit of putting the interests of the motherland and the people first, and the tenacious style of fearless young bulls, is not this the most precious spirit of our times and nation?

On May 31, 1989, the Communist Youth League Central Committee and the State Education Commission conferred the title of "Heroic Youth" on Lai Ning and called on all ethnic minority Young Pioneers across the country to learn from Lai Ning.

The spirit of Lai Ning, like a blazing torch of the Chinese Young Pioneers, will never be extinguished!

    当代英雄少年——赖宁
    孙云晓
    1988年3月13日，一个14岁的初中生倒下了，倒在他所热爱的家乡的山林里。一场山火扑灭了，他的遗体四周静静地飘升着缕缕青烟……
    4天后为他举行的隆重的追悼会，来了3000多人。老人说，这是四川省石棉县历史上最隆重的葬礼。
    横断山入云，大渡河呜咽。无声的泪水，深情的怀念，一齐献给这位英雄的少年……书，使他插上理想的翅膀
    赖宁生活的四川省石棉县县城新棉镇，四周被群山包围。然而，偏僻而封闭的环境，没有挡住赖宁的目光。读小学三年级时，赖宁便获得了四川省红领巾读书读报比赛一等奖。书，开阔了他的视野。
    每逢生日或节日，爸爸妈妈问他要什么礼物，他总是两个字：“要书！”在他的遗物中最多的也是书。他最爱读的《李四光》，不知翻了多少遍。几位邻居说，赖宁常去他们家看书，一看就是半天。
    赖宁崇拜古今中外的杰出人物。在一次少先队中队会上，许多男队员希望长大了当军官。赖宁说：“我要像李四光那样，当一个地质学家！”有人提醒他：“当地质学家可是又艰苦又危险啊！”他听了一耸肩膀，很不以为然。老师问他为什么想当地质学家，他说：“咱们这儿到处都是大山，不是已经发现许多石棉矿了吗？一定还会有其他宝藏，我要把它们找出来献给祖国！”
    中队集体去春游。赖宁东寻西找拾了一口袋石头，还挑出一块追着老师问：“您讲李四光时提到的青石，是这一种吗？”
    探险是他的一大爱好
    赖宁的爸爸赖正钢兄弟四人的孩子中，唯有赖宁是男孩。因此，一大家子都把赖宁视为掌上明珠。但赖宁不愿做个娇弱的孩子。
      “我经常利用课余时间或节假日，去攀登莽莽大山，征服陡峭的崖壁，进行探险活动。仗着我命大，好几次都是死里逃生，可是我越发地喜爱探险。到五年级时，探险已成了我的嗜好。但父母的消息十分灵通，他们常常给我上思想教育课。我父母的反对和我的坚持，使我的性格变得倔强起来。”这是赖宁在《我的小传》中写的一段话。
    赖宁心里非常清楚，如果没有探险家的胆略和本领，是当不成优秀地质学家的。因此，他经常进行探险锻炼，翻山越岭，采集矿石标本。他还把一套矿石标本送给母校——新棉镇小学。
    新棉镇小学的陈老师讲了一件令人吃惊的事情：“六年级时，我在班上讲要写好作品必须注意观察。谁知，赖宁决定写一篇题为《捅马蜂窝》的作文，就真去做捅马蜂窝的试验！据他事后告诉我，他爬上树，用棍子狠捅马蜂窝，马蜂成群飞来蜇他。可他并不逃跑，只用准备好的厚衣服蒙住头，露出眼睛仔细观察。他这篇作文写得扣人心弦。”
    在他牺牲前不久，他还特意买了一个蓝色塑料本，并在上面写下了进一步探险的计划：
    称呼——金龙队，简称JLD，秘密代号为X；
    日期——1987年8月1日诞生；
    地点——本队活动于石棉县，大至四川省；
    人员——迄今只有1人（最多有3人）参加本队；
    宗旨——发展现代科学技术，推崇探险精神，向大自然索取宝藏而揭其奥秘。
    由于赖宁一向品学兼优，全面发展，他在小学期间年年被评为“三好学生”和“优秀少先队员”。小学毕业时，学校决定保送他升中学，他却坚持参加考试，并以新棉镇第一名的优异成绩，考入省重点校——石棉县中学。他懂得做大事是从做小事开始的
    永不服输是赖宁鲜明的个性特点。
    他与一位同学比赛掰手腕，成了人家的手下败将。从此，他天天提着20公斤重的大铁桶练臂力和手劲。半个月后，他重新向那位胜利者挑战，上次的胜利者这次败得没有回手之力。
    然而，升入中学的赖宁却在“三好学生”评比中落选了！
    谈起这件事，赖宁的老师和同学无不感慨万分。当时，班里纪律有些乱，班主任让学习委员赖宁记下违反纪律的同学的名字。尽管赖宁“先礼后兵”，可这毕竟是件得罪人的事。结果，身为第一候选人的赖宁，在他进入中学的第一次也是最后一次评选“三好学生”中，得票未能过半。许多同学都替赖宁屈得慌。他本人却像什么也没有发生过。他不但学习成绩优秀，而且特别关心集体，助人为乐，又是雅安地区少年儿童绘画比赛二等奖和县少年书法比赛一等奖的获得者。
    他爱家乡的山和水石棉山区是四川省一类火险区。
    赖宁读小学的时候曾3次上山灭火。他做了这些事，既不写出来，更不告诉别人。直到林业部门把表扬信寄来学校，老师们才知道。
    1988年3月13日15时30分左右，县城附近山林因电线短路引起大火。火借风势，刹那间海子山上火海一片。大片国有林和本县电视卫星转播台、石油公司油库，都面临巨大的威胁。
    这是一个星期日的下午。赖宁的爸爸抱病在办公室设计水电站图纸，妈妈头疼昏睡在床上。赖宁写完作业，说了声：“我下楼走一走。”妈妈费力地睁开眼睛，还特意嘱咐：“外面风大，别走远了！”
    下了楼，赖宁一眼便瞧见了冲天的火焰。他连告诉妈妈一声都来不及，飞快地直奔火场。
    与他一起救火的王海和周伟等同学回忆，他们在山上碰到赖宁时，他正在挥动松枝奋力灭火。高达二三十米的火苗，狂烧猛跃。赖宁和他的伙伴们英勇顽强，一次又一次地冲向火海。
    在现场指挥救火的县领导，看到天色已晚，命令用汽车将参加救火的学生、妇女和老人强行送下山。赖宁、周伟、王海等同学也被拉上了车。在车上，有人遗憾地说：“咳，今晚看不成电视剧《再向虎山行》了。”赖宁却风趣地说：“那我们就再向火山行！”一车人都笑了。
    突然，山下的烈火又疯狂地扑上来。赖宁一见，立即跳下车来。王海和周伟也相继冲了上去，3个人齐心协力迎战烈火。当防火队员再次把周伟和王海推上汽车时，却没有找到赖宁。天黑山大，火凶林密，防火队员们一边救火一边继续寻找。
    大火终于扑灭了。3500余亩国有森林保住了，县电视卫星转播台和石油公司油库都平安无事了。可是，14日上午9时，人们在昨夜火势最凶猛的海子山南坡的过火林带中，发现了赖宁的遗体：他，右臂紧紧挽着一棵小松树，额头搁在山坡上，眼镜丢失了，左手撑着地，右腿还保持着向上攀登的姿势……
    我们不提倡少年儿童参加扑救森林火灾。《森林防火条例》明确规定：“扑救森林火灾不得动员残疾人员、孕妇和儿童参加。”然而，赖宁怀着崇高的责任感，自觉投入保护国家和集体财产的救火战斗，这种以祖国与人民利益为重的革命精神和初生牛犊不惧虎的顽强风格，不正是我们时代和民族极其珍贵的精神吗？
    1989年5月31日，共青团中央和国家教委授予赖宁“英雄少年”的光荣称号，并号召全国各族少先队员向赖宁同学学习。
    赖宁精神，像中国少先队的一支熊熊燃烧的火炬，永不熄灭！（附图片）
