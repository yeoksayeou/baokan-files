	Guizhou Introduces Non-Stick Aluminum Pots

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, October 5th – China's first production line for non-stick cookware has, since its trial run last October, produced over 100,000 non-stick aluminum pots, which are now available in both domestic and international markets.

	Using non-stick aluminum pots for boiling, frying, stir-frying, and pan-frying various foods not only prevents food from sticking to the pot but also ensures that food does not come into contact with the aluminum base, preventing the harmful effects of aluminum on the human body. Therefore, it is a clean, hygienic, and safe type of cookware that meets food hygiene standards.
