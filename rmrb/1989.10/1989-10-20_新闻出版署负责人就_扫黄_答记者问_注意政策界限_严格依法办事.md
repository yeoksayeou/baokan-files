**Official from the Press and Publication Administration on "Cleaning Up" Answers Questions from Reporters**
**Attention to Policy Boundaries and Strict Legal Procedures**

A responsible official from the Press and Publication Administration recently accepted an interview with a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, addressing questions related to policy adherence and legal procedures during the "Cleaning Up" campaign.

**Q: What types of books and publications were seized and sealed during this "Cleaning Up" campaign?**

**A:** Apart from a small portion of illegal, reactionary, and politically erroneous publications and audio-visual products, the vast majority were various publications and audio-visual products that promote obscenity, pornography, violence, and feudal superstitions.

**Q: Are there any new regulations regarding policy boundaries during this "Cleaning Up" campaign?**

**A:** Recently, there has been an increase in publications that, while not strictly obscene or pornographic, contain elements of obscenity, vulgarity, and promote violence and feudal superstitions. Some publishing units assumed that as long as their publications did not qualify as obscene, they would not be investigated. They exploited this loophole and pushed the boundaries, leading to a proliferation of such harmful publications. This situation has caused significant public dissatisfaction and severe criticism. Therefore, during this "Cleaning Up" campaign, clear regulations have been established to include these types of publications in the scope of those to be banned. This approach has proven effective and has garnered broad public support.

**Q: Who is responsible for the classification and handling of banned publications during this "Cleaning Up" campaign?**

**A:** Each province has established a "Cleaning Up" working group led by the Party committee and the government, which oversees this work. To quickly purify the book market, provincial-level press and publication management departments can temporarily seal problematic publications. The principle is "whoever manages it is responsible for it." Publications from local provinces are classified and handled by the local publication management departments, while those from central-level publishing units are handled by the relevant national management departments. This strict regulation on classification and handling authority ensures that the work is carried out in accordance with policies and legal procedures.

**Q: The public is very concerned about the classification of seized publications. Could you provide more details on the specific procedures and methods?**

**A:** The classification of seized publications is based on their specific content and guided by relevant laws and regulations. First, the management department organizes professionals and experts to thoroughly review the publications, understand their content and issues, and analyze their social impact. Then, based on relevant laws and regulations, the nature of the publications is determined, and appropriate handling suggestions are made. Some cases are handled by administrative departments, while others are referred to public security or judicial authorities. For example, a book that appears to be about fortune-telling based on facial features actually promotes the idea that a woman's facial features can indicate her sexual desires and lewdly describes and teaches sexual techniques. This book promotes obscene behavior, has sexually provocative content, and can lead to moral degradation without any scientific value. Therefore, this book was classified as obscene literature.

**Q: How does this "Cleaning Up" campaign address the issue of covers, illustrations, and advertisements that promote obscenity and violence?**

**A:** In reality, covers and illustrations are not only the external forms of publications but also integral parts of their overall content. Covers and illustrations that promote obscenity, violence, and feudal superstitions, as well as advertisements, have the same harmful effects on readers as other parts of obscene publications. Some publishing units often harbor a sense of luck, believing that as long as the book's content does not reach the level of being banned, using covers and illustrations to promote obscenity and violence to attract readers is not a big deal. In fact, such covers themselves have a very negative impact on society. This "Cleaning Up" campaign clearly stipulates that any publication with covers, illustrations, or advertisements that promote obscenity, violence, and feudal superstitions will be banned. This is necessary to stop such harmful trends.

**Q: What restrictions are there on publications that have been explicitly banned?**

**A:** Publications that have been classified and banned are not allowed to be sold again. Relevant departments have issued lists of such publications. If they are still found in the market, they must be immediately handed over to the local management departments. Continuing to sell them will result in severe penalties. These publications are also not allowed to be rented out. We hope that the public will monitor the book market and together resist "yellow" publications.

    新闻出版署负责人就“扫黄”答记者问
    注意政策界限　严格依法办事
    新华社北京10月19日电　新闻出版署负责人日前接受新华社记者采访，就“扫黄”中坚持执行政策、依法办事等方面的问题回答了记者的提问。
    问：这次“扫黄”中收缴查封的3000多万册书刊，都是些什么样的书刊？
    答：除了一小部分是非法的、反动的、有严重政治错误的出版物和音像制品外，绝大部分是各种宣扬淫秽、色情、暴力和封建迷信的出版物和音像制品。
    问：这次“扫黄”在政策界限上有什么新的规定？
    答：前一段，够不上定为淫秽色情出版物，但是夹杂淫秽色情内容、低级庸俗和宣扬凶杀暴力、封建迷信的出版物越来越多。这是因为一些出版单位以为只要够不上淫秽出版物就可以不被查处，他们钻这空子，打“擦边球”，实际上已过了线。这类出版物泛滥成灾，同样起到了“黄害”的恶劣作用，已经招致社会的强烈不满和严厉批评。因此，针对这个情况，在“扫黄”中作了明确规定，把这类出版物都列入了取缔的范围。现在看来，这样做效果很好，广大人民群众也是赞同的。
    问：这次“扫黄”对被取缔的出版物的定性、处理由谁来做？
    答：各省都成立了由党委和政府直接领导的“扫黄”工作小组，统一抓这项工作。为了尽快净化书刊市场，省级新闻出版等管理部门，对有问题的出版物可以先封存，然后按谁主管谁负责的原则，本省的出版物由本省的出版管理部门定性、处理；中央级出版单位的出版物则由国家有关管理部门来定性、处理，不是任何单位和个人都可以定性、处理的。这种关于定性、处理权限的严格规定，从组织上保证了定性、处理工作能够执行政策，依法办事。
    问：大家对被查封的出版物的定性很关心，请您再对定性的具体做法和程序作些介绍。
    答：对被查封的出版物的定性要以出版物的具体内容为依据，以有关的法律和法规为准绳。首先要由管理部门组织力量，包括专业管理人员和有关方面专家，对出版物进行认真的审读，搞清楚出版物内容和存在的问题，并分析其对社会的危害程度。然后依照有关法律和法规，认定出版物的性质，再根据定性，提出相应的处理意见。有的由行政部门作出处理，有的要移送公安、司法机关处理。例如有一本书，从书名看似乎仅是一本看相算命的书。实际上是宣扬根据女性的面相，可以推断女性的性欲能力，并且淫亵性地描述和传授性技巧。这本书宣扬了淫秽行为，具有性挑逗的内容，足以导致人腐化堕落，又没有任何科学价值。因此，这本书被定为淫秽图书。
    问：对出版物的封面、插图和广告宣传品渲染色情、暴力问题，在这次“扫黄”中如何解决？
    答：实际上封面、插图既是出版物的外部形式，也是构成出版物整体内容的一个组成部分。渲染淫秽色情、凶杀暴力的封面、插图以及广告本身同淫秽色情出版物的其他部分一样，对读者同样具有毒害作用。有些出版单位总是藏着侥幸心理，以为只要书的内容够不上被查禁的程度，在封面、插图上渲染色情、凶杀以招徕读者，关系不大。事实上，这种封面本身就对社会造成了很坏的影响。这次“扫黄”明确规定一条，凡是封面、插图、广告宣传品渲染淫秽色情、凶杀暴力、封建迷信的出版物，也一律取缔。不这样不足以制止这种歪风。
    问：对已经明文取缔的书刊有什么限制？
    答：凡是已定性、取缔的书刊一律不得再销售。对这类书刊有关部门陆续发出目录。如果市场还有的，必须立即上缴给当地管理部门。如果继续销售，要从重处罚。这类书刊也不得再租借。希望广大读者对书刊市场进行监督，大家共同抵制“黄色”书刊。
