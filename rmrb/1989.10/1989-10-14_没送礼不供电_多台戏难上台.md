	This year, fifteen villages in Chengzhuang Township of our county staged nineteen plays. Except for Daju Village, which did not experience a power outage, all other villages had power outages during their performances. The electrician for Chengzhuang Township, Liu Hailian, said, "No matter whose family is putting on a play, they must inform me." By "inform," he means giving him gifts. Villages like Chixiahu and Daju both gave Liu Hailian cash and gifts. Shipantou Village did not give gifts, and there was no electricity for three days during their play, so the village had to stop the performance at night. Liu Hailian never allows anyone to check the electricity meters in the villages, saying that whatever the electricity bill is, the villagers must pay it. Hujiawan Village refused to use electricity because of this. Xinsheke Village, wanting to know the meter readings, locked the meter box, but Liu found out and cut the village's power lines.

    没送礼不供电  多台戏难上台
    今年，我县城庄乡十五个村子唱了十九台戏。除大居村没有停电外，其余村庄都在唱戏时停了电。城庄乡电路维护工刘海连说：“不管谁家唱戏，都要同我打招呼。”他所说的“招呼”，就是要给他送礼。赤崖会村、大居村等都给刘海连送了现金和礼品。石盘头村没有送礼，唱戏时三天没有来电，村里只好晚上停演。刘海连从不让别人查看各村的电表，他说收多少电费，村民就要交多少电费。郝家湾村为此拒绝用电。新舍窠村为知电表走数，在电表盒上上了锁，刘知道后把这个村的电线剪断了。
