Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th.

About 1,500 representatives from various sectors of the capital gathered this afternoon for a grand meeting to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Li Siguang, an outstanding scientist, renowned social activist, educator, and pioneer of China's geological industry.

State Chairman Yang Shangkun attended the commemorative meeting and delivered a speech (full text on the second page).

In his speech, Yang Shangkun highly praised Li Siguang's life, describing him as an outstanding representative of China's progressive intellectuals and a flag-bearer for China's intellectuals. He called on everyone to learn from Li Siguang's patriotism, his spirit of loving and serving the country, his pursuit of truth and light, and his excellent style of unity and struggle.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology Qian Xuesen delivered a report titled "A Beacon of Light."

In his report, Qian Xuesen introduced Li Siguang's life, noting that Li Siguang dedicated his life to the study of earth sciences, writing millions of words of scientific works. Li Siguang's establishment of geotectonics, which closely combines mechanics and geology, opened a new path to solving problems of the earth's crustal structure and movement.

Qian Xuesen said that when China began implementing its first five-year plan, leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Liu Shaoqi were very concerned about China's oil problem and hoped that Li Siguang would provide strategic advice. After carefully analyzing China's geological conditions, Li Siguang proposed breaking away from the limited oil exploration in the northwest and conducting oil geological surveys nationwide. He made an indelible contribution to finding oil for the motherland.

Qian Xuesen also introduced Li Siguang's creative contributions in mineral geology, coalfield geology, engineering geology, and hydrogeology, and praised Li Siguang as a pioneer of modern Chinese earth sciences.

Attending the meeting were Song Ping, Wen Jiabao, Zhang Jinfu, Yan Jizi, Wang Renhe, Zhou Peiyuan, Qian Weichang, Lu Qixi, Sima Yimaiti, and relevant department heads, as well as Li Siguang's relatives.

The meeting also saw the first presentation of the "Li Siguang Geological Science Award," with 14 individuals receiving this honor for their outstanding contributions in field geology, geological research, and geological education.
