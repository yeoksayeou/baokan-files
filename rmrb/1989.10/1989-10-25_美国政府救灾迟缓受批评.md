The U.S. federal government's bureaucratic approach to disaster relief following the San Francisco earthquake has drawn criticism from local governments and many individuals in the affected area.

After the 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck the San Francisco region on October 17, President Bush immediately directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate relief efforts between the federal government and local authorities. However, FEMA did not establish relief centers in the seven affected counties until the afternoon of October 22. Since October 20, the agency has only processed 4,000 assistance applications. This disaster has affected tens of thousands of residents, with 12,000 people left homeless and in urgent need of government aid.

The estimated damage from this earthquake ranges from $7 billion to $10 billion. During his visit to the disaster area on October 20, President Bush promised that the federal government would "do everything in its power to help the people of the disaster area get through this difficult time." He agreed with congressional leaders to provide $250 million in federal emergency relief funds for the affected area.

However, as of today, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are still debating the amount of relief funds.

Over the past six days, 12,000 displaced residents in the San Francisco earthquake zone have been temporarily housed in hotels and earthquake shelters with the help of local governments and the Red Cross. They are eagerly awaiting government assistance to rebuild their homes. On October 20, during President Bush's visit to the disaster area, San Francisco Mayor Agnos personally requested that the president take immediate relief actions and "write a check on the spot." Bush responded, "We need to work together." In response to criticism from disaster victims about the federal government's slow response, a FEMA spokesperson defensively stated, "We don't have a magic wand. People need to understand that FEMA is not waiting for disasters to happen."

On September 21, after Hurricane Hugo, the most destructive storm of the century, struck South Carolina, the agency took seven days to establish a relief center. Some lawmakers criticized this irresponsible delay as "pure bureaucracy."

　　美国政府救灾迟缓受批评
    新华社华盛顿10月23日电  （记者陆文岳）美国联邦政府在旧金山地震后的救灾工作中表现出来的官僚主义作风，遭到了灾区地方政府和许多人的指责。
    旧金山地区17日发生6.9级大地震后，布什总统虽然马上指示联邦紧急事务管理署负责协调联邦政府与当地政府的救灾工作，但该署却迟至22日下午才在受灾的7个县设立了救灾中心。自20日以来，该署只处理了4000份补助申请书。而这次大灾波及数以万计的居民，其中有1.2万人无家可归，急需政府救济。
    这次地震造成的损失估计高达70亿至100亿美元。布什总统20日视察灾区时曾保证联邦政府将“竭尽全力帮助灾区人民渡过难关”。他与国会领袖商定向灾区提供25亿美元的联邦紧急救济金。
    然而，时至今日，国会山上的议员们还在救济金的数额问题上争论不休。
    6天来，旧金山震区1.2万名灾民在地方政府和红十字会的帮助下，暂时栖身于旅馆和地震棚内。他们迫切希望政府能尽早帮助他们重建家园。旧金山市长艾格诺斯20日在布什视察灾区时曾当面提出，希望总统迅速采取救灾行动，“当场就开支票”。但布什则回答说，“我们需要互相合作。”联邦紧急事务管理署发言人在答复灾民对联邦政府的批评时，竟振振有辞地说：“我们没有魔杖。人们必须明白，联邦紧急事务管理署并没有人在等待灾难发生”。
    今年9月21日，当本世纪破坏力最大的“雨果”飓风袭击美国南卡罗来纳州之后，该署花了7天时间才设立了一个救灾中心，一些议员指责这种不负责任的拖拉作风是“十足的官僚主义”。
