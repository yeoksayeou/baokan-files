People always cherish their hometowns. However, for us, the children of Zhongshan who went to support the border regions, the place that still lingers in our hearts day and night is our second hometown—Ordos.

Ordos is ancient, mysterious, and full of charm.

The cattle and sheep on the Etuoke Grassland are like the stars in the Milky Way, and the coal fields in the Jungar Mountains are like a sea of black with golden waves.

If the torch of the "Donggui Long" rebellion illuminated the horse-riding nation, then the trains running on the Baolan Railway showcase the descendants of Genghis Khan's splendor. If a song like "Toasting Song" reveals a glimpse of the hospitality of the Darga people, then the phrase "Amul" (wishing for peace) is filled with the deep affection of the Ordos people for us, the young people supporting the border regions.

That was an unforgettable year.

Three leaders of the Republic passed away, the "Gang of Four" wreaked havoc across the country, the Tangshan earthquake struck, and floods hit the highlands. It was in this chilly spring that our twin sons, Kun and Peng, were born in the Sumitu Village of Etuoke Banner. Great disasters, bad timing, and a severe shortage of breast milk made the cries of the twins heart-wrenching.

Heaven was unkind, but people were compassionate. The grasslands opened their warm embrace. Many pairs of hands, strangers though they were, reached out to help us. The Party secretary, upon hearing the news, sent 15 bags of milk powder for Kun and Peng. The village officials, upon hearing the news, brought back yulin milk cakes from their trip to Shaanxi. The children of the border defense team sent milk powder from Xilinguole. Most touching of all was the Mongolian woman, Midengma. Under the guidance of her mother, who taught her that "both the palm and the back of the hand are flesh," she voluntarily came to our door, insisted on feeding the twins without accepting any refusal. To nourish Kun and Peng, she not only gave up her daily rest time but also switched her four-month-old daughter to a diet of millet porridge. She braved the wind and snow, without taking a single penny, and silently fed the twins for a month or so!

Oh, Ordos, these are the grassland children you nurtured with your sweet milk. In your motherly embrace, the children of various ethnic groups live in harmony.

That year, the herdsman Basu from our Sumitu Brigade fell critically ill and needed a blood transfusion. Upon hearing the news, the children of Zhongshan immediately dropped their tools and rushed to the hospital 100 miles away. "Doctor, take mine, I am type O blood," a girl rolled up her sleeve; "Doctor, I am strong, take mine," a young man showed his arm; a little girl with braids pushed forward, almost in tears, "Doctor, take mine too." For a moment, the doctor holding the syringe was at a loss as to whose blood to take...

Oh, Ordos, the hot blood of the grassland brothers flows in the veins of our Zhongshan children; the milk of the herdsmen's wives flows in the veins of our children who supported the border regions. We are connected by blood and milk. Is this not a true reflection of the socialist family of our motherland!

Oh, Ordos, in your vast, deep, and loving embrace, we, the children of Zhongshan, have grown up. Among us, some have become leaders of joint ventures; some are outstanding figures in ethnic education; some have won honors in the "Awarding Medals to Border Children" campaign; some convey information for the economic construction of the grassland hometown; some have married Mongolian youth. Unity and construction, common prosperity—this is the theme of our times! Hey, the Yellow River can change its course, and the vast desert can be moved, but this song will never fade, because it is sung by people of all ethnicities, and led by the great Party!

Time flies, but true feelings never fade. Although we were transferred back to Nanjing last spring, the Ordos where we lived and worked for 20 years, oh, we and the twin sons often miss the yellow hills, the sour milk, and the people on the grasslands. Kun and Peng often ask me, "Dad, when will you take us back to the grasslands?" I confidently smile, "There will be such a day!"

There will be such a day: On the ancient and mysterious Ordos grasslands, in the new and fragrant Mongolian yurt, Old Mother, please drink a cup of wine offered by your Zhongshan children; let us, like in the old days, dance joyfully to the tune of the "Toasting Song," and together shout "Amul" for our multi-ethnic republic!

    萦怀牵梦的鄂尔多斯
    孙国光
    人，总是眷恋自己的故乡。然而，对于我们这批支边的钟山儿女来说，至今仍日夜魂牵梦绕的，却是那曾经哺育过我们的第二故乡——鄂尔多斯。
    鄂尔多斯，古老、神奇而又极富魅力。
    那鄂托克草原的牛羊宛若银河闪烁，那准格尔山地的煤田恰似乌海泛金。
    如果说“独贵龙”（历史上蒙古族人民对清政府和蒙古族贵族的一次反抗运动）的火炬映红了马背上的民族，那么奔驰在包兰铁路上的列车则展现了成吉思汗后裔的风采；如果说一曲《祝酒歌》足可见达尔扈特部热情好客之一斑，那么一声“阿茂勒”（祝福平安），则浸透了鄂尔多斯人民对我们支边青年的一片深情厚意——
    那是一个令人终生难忘的一年。
    共和国的三位领导人相继逝世，“四人帮”在神州大地倒行逆施，唐山大地震，高原发大水。就在这一年的寒春中，我们的孪生子鲲、鹏在鄂托克旗苏米图苏木（乡）呱呱落地了。大灾大难，生不逢时，加上母奶奇缺，孪生子的哭声哟，让人心碎。
    苍天无情人有情。草原敞开了温暖的怀抱。一双双热情的、素不相识的手伸向了我们。党委书记闻讯后，给鲲、鹏送来15袋奶粉；苏木干部闻讯后，出差陕北捎来了榆林奶糕；戍边二连的牧民子弟闻讯后，寄来了锡盟奶粉。更加感人肺腑的是蒙古族妇女米德格玛，在老额吉（母亲）“手心手背都是肉”的教诲下，主动登门，不容推辞，硬是一手一个抱起鲲、鹏喂起奶来。为了哺育鲲、鹏，她不仅把出工库伦的一天两次的休息时间全放弃了；而且对自己4个月的女孩改喂小米糊糊。她风雪无阻，分文不收，默默地一哺就是个把月！
    哦，鄂尔多斯，这就是你用甘甜的乳汁哺育出的草原儿女。在你慈母般的怀抱里生活的各民族儿女心心相印。
    那一年，我们苏米图大队的牧民巴苏病危急需输血，队上的钟山儿女闻讯后，立即丢下手中的劳动工具，呼啦一下赶到百里外的旗医院。“医生，抽我的，我是O型血”，姑娘挽起了袖子；“医生，我身体结实，快抽我的”，小伙亮出了胳膊；一个扎着小辫的少女挤上前快哭出声来了，“医生，还有我哩”。一时间，手握注射器的医生竟不知该抽谁的血是好……
    哦，鄂尔多斯，在草原兄弟的身上，跳动着我们钟山儿女的热血；在我们支边青年后代的身上，流淌着牧民妇女的乳汁。血肉相连，水乳交融。这不正是祖国社会主义大家庭的真实写照吗！
    哦，鄂尔多斯，在你博大、浑厚、深情的怀抱里，我们钟山儿女成长起来了。我们中有的成为中外合资企业的带头人；有的成了民族教育事业的佼佼者；有的在“为边陲儿女挂奖章”活动中喜获殊荣；有的为草原家乡的经济建设传递信息；有的和蒙古族青年喜结良缘。团结建设，共同繁荣，这不正是我们这个时代的主题歌吗！嗨咿，九曲黄河可以改道，万顷黄沙可以迁徙，然而，这首歌世世代代终将不落，因为合唱它的是各民族人民，领唱它的是伟大的党！
    岁月易逝，真情难泯。虽然去年春天我们才调回南京，可是生活和工作了整整20个寒暑的鄂尔多斯哟，我们，还有那孪生子却时常念叨着那黄土坡，那酸牛奶，那草原上的人们。鲲、鹏时常问我：“爸爸，什么时候带我们再去草原？”我自信地笑道：“会有这么一天的！”
    会有那么一天的：在古老而神奇的鄂尔多斯草原上，在崭新而洋溢着奶茶香味的蒙古包里，老额吉，请喝一杯您的钟山儿女敬的酒；让我们像当年那样伴着《祝酒歌》的旋律跳起欢快的舞，对我们这个多民族的共和国齐呼一句“阿茂勒”！
