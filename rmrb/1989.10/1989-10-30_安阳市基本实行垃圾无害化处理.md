Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 29th.

Anyang City no longer disposes of garbage by simply digging pits and piling it up. The city has established a harmless treatment plant for domestic waste and has turned waste into treasure by setting up a production line for harmless, fully-nutritional compound fertilizer. The plant produces 120 to 200 tons of compound fertilizer daily and processes 120 tons of garbage per day.

The garbage treatment plant in Anyang City was built in 1987. The factory uses urban garbage, fly ash, and manure as raw materials. Through processes such as mixing, magnetic separation, sorting, crushing, and stirring, followed by covering with plastic film and fermentation, the materials are ultimately transformed into compound fertilizer.

　　安阳市基本实行垃圾无害化处理
    据新华社郑州十月二十九日电  （记者刘雅鸣）安阳市对生活垃圾的处理不再是挖坑堆积，这里不仅建成了生活废弃物无害化处理厂，还变废为宝，建起了无害化全营养复合肥料生产线，日产复合肥一百二十至二百吨，日处理垃圾一百二十吨。
    安阳市这家垃圾处理厂是一九八七年建设的。工厂以城市垃圾、粉煤灰、粪便为原料，通过配料、磁选、分拣、粉碎、搅拌等工序，再经塑料薄膜覆盖、发酵，最终成为复合肥料。
