The development of China's rural social economy over the past 40 years, from 1949 to 1989, has seen both remarkable successes and numerous challenges. Compared to China's agricultural history spanning thousands of years, the achievements of these 40 years are truly remarkable.

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the publication of "Forty Years of Rural China," co-authored by the Policy and Law Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Rural Department of the National Bureau of Statistics and published by the Central Plains Farmers Press, is undoubtedly a significant event.

The blueprint for the development of China's rural social economy was drawn up on the basis of a situation that was "poor and blank." Over the past 40 years, hundreds of millions of farmers, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have started by reforming the semi-colonial and semi-feudal rural production relations, through institutional reforms, technological transformations, and structural adjustments, rapidly restored and developed China's agriculture, and promoted the coordinated development of the rural economy and the national economy as a whole. Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, while seriously summarizing the experiences and lessons of the previous period of rural development, the Party and the state formulated a set of rural policies in line with China's national conditions, implemented the household contract responsibility system, reformed the circulation system, adjusted the rural industrial structure, and promoted the rapid development of the rural commodity economy. Thus, the fate of farmers, agriculture, and rural areas has become more closely linked with the overall development of the national economy, exploring a path of modernization of the rural socialist economy with Chinese characteristics.

Reform and development are the themes of China's rural social and economic construction in the new era. On the one hand, we have actively and proactively explored various aspects of rural social and economic development with the spirit of reform, pragmatism, innovation, and development. On the other hand, we have regarded the continuous and stable growth of agricultural productivity as the basic goal of rural development and made unremitting efforts for it. Under the trend of reform and development, farmers have gained autonomy, agriculture has developed, and rural areas are becoming prosperous. Although the path of development is not smooth, we also reflect on the setbacks and mistakes in the process of development, but from an overall perspective, the various aspects of China's rural social economy are indeed advancing step by step.

It is based on the above background that "Forty Years of Rural China" adopts a method of combining data with analysis, integrating data and historical facts, and listing and analyzing the basic structural characteristics, historical changes, and main threads of the development of China's rural social economy from a macro perspective. It also records, in different chapters, different periods, different levels, and different regions, the following major issues: First, the natural environment and socio-economic conditions that formed the basic trajectory of the development of rural China; second, an evaluation of the reforms of the agricultural economic system and technological system; third, focusing on the changes in farmers' income, the adjustment of agricultural industrial structure, and the coordinated development of the rural economy, it analyzes in depth the socio-economic reasons that triggered rural reforms; fourth, it analyzes the social development issues related to rural economic development. The editors fully affirm the great progress made by China's agriculture by combining the excellent traditional practices of fine farming with modern agricultural technologies applicable to China, the brilliant success of the development of the second and third industries in rural areas, and the positive role of agriculture as the foundation in supporting the development of the national economy and the realization of national industrialization. Moreover, it does not shy away from the mistakes made in the development of rural social economy due to certain subjective and objective reasons, and gives a relatively fair and objective evaluation. In this sense, this book is written with an attitude of seeking truth from facts about the history of the development of China's rural social economy.

It is difficult to accurately grasp the pulse of the development of China's rural social economy, and it is even more difficult to make an "accurate" judgment about it. The value of "Forty Years of Rural China" lies in providing a relatively complete set of basic materials for every reader who is eager to understand the development of rural China and every scholar who hopes to study rural China, for further discussion and evaluation.

    《中国农村四十年》序
    何康
    1949—1989年，新中国农村社会经济的发展，既有着许多成功的喜悦，也经历了不少曲折的艰辛。然而，比较起具有数千年传统的中国农业史，这40年所取得的成就是举世瞩目的。
    时逢中华人民共和国成立40周年之际，由农业部政策法规司和国家统计局农村司联合编著、中原农民出版社出版的《中国农村四十年》问世，无疑是件非常有意义的事情。
    新中国的农村社会经济发展蓝图实际上是在“一穷二白”的基础上描绘的。40年间，亿万农民在中国共产党的领导下，从改造半殖民地半封建的农村生产关系入手，通过体制变革、技术改造、结构调整等手段，使我国农业很快得到恢复和发展，并牵动农村经济乃至整个国民经济的协调发展。特别是党的十一届三中全会以后，在认真总结了前期农村发展的经验和教训的同时，党和国家制定了一整套符合我国国情的农村政策，实行了联产承包责任制，改革了流通体制，调整了农村产业结构，促进了农村商品经济的迅速发展，从而使农民、农业、农村的命运同国民经济的整体更为密切地联系在一起，探索了具有中国特色的社会主义农村经济现代化的道路。
    改革和发展是新时期我国农村社会经济建设的主题。我们一方面本着改革、求实、创新、发展的精神，积极主动地对农村社会经济的各个方面进行了探索；另一方面将农业生产力的持续稳定增长视作我国农村发展的基本目标，为之进行了不懈的努力。在改革和发展的大趋势下，农民获得了自主权利，农业得到了发展，农村正在走向繁荣。尽管发展的道路并非一片坦途，我们也为发展中的某些波折和失误而反思，但从总体上观察，我国农村社会经济的各方面的确是一步一个脚印前进的。
    正是依据上述背景，《中国农村四十年》采用了资料与分析相结合的方式，融数据和史实为一体，从宏观的角度列举和分析了新中国农村社会经济的基本结构特征、历史变迁特点和农村发展的主体线索，并且在不同的章节分时期、分层次、分区域地记述了如下几大问题：一是形成新中国农村发展基本轨迹的自然环境和社会经济条件；二是对农业经济制度和技术制度变革的评价；三是以农民的收入变迁、农业的产业结构调整以及农村经济的协调发展为主要线索，重点分析了引发农村改革的社会经济原因；四是围绕农村经济发展分析了与此相关的社会发展问题。编者充分肯定了新中国农业依靠精耕细作的优良传统和现代农业适用技术相结合取得的巨大进步，农村第二、三产业发展的辉煌成功，以及作为基础的农业在支撑国民经济发展和国家工业化的实现中的积极作用。而且，对农村社会经济发展中由于某些主观和客观原因导致的失误并不讳言，客观地进行了较公正的评价。就此而言，这本书是本着实事求是的态度来撰写新中国农村社会经济发展的历史的。
    准确地把握中国农村社会经济发展的脉络是困难的，而要对此进行“准确的”评判更非易事。《中国农村四十年》的价值在于为每一位愿意了解新中国农村发展的热忱读者和希望研究中国农村的学者，提供了一部较完整的基础性资料，供有志者研讨评说。
