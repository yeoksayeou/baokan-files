    The Head of the Property Management Office Lives in a Temporary Hut
    Mo Yunming, the head of the Property Management Office of the Yiyang City Real Estate Management Bureau in Hunan Province, has been living in a temporary hut with his family since July this year, making it a total of four years.

    After Mo Yunming took over as the head of the Property Management Office in 1981, he was in charge of managing over 820,000 square meters of public housing. He originally had a two-bedroom apartment in the convenient and accessible Qiaobei Residential Committee in the city. However, shortly after moving in, a retired senior official living on the fourth floor approached him, complaining of high blood pressure, heart disease, and difficulty walking, and requested that Mo Yunming arrange a ground-floor apartment for him. After much consideration, Mo Yunming decided to exchange his own ground-floor apartment with the retired official, fulfilling the old man's wish. In 1985, the bureau built a new residential building on Xizheng Street in the city for families relocating due to road construction. To accommodate two more families in need of housing, Mo Yunming persuaded his wife and children to move out of the high-rise building and into a temporary hut constructed during the building of the new residence. This hut was surrounded by a foul-smelling pond in front and sewage from a neighboring hospital in the back. Mo Yunming and his family worked together to fill in the pond and hired craftsmen to repair the doors and windows, lay the floor, and install water and electricity, spending over 600 yuan in total. He said, "Although the living conditions are a bit rough, my heart is at ease." Over the eight years that Mo Yunming has been the head of the Property Management Office, he has adjusted and allocated over 1,600 residential units for residents, but he has not arranged a single unit for himself.

    房管科科长住工棚
    湖南益阳市房地产管理局房管科长莫运明一家到今年7月，已在工棚里住了整整4年。
    1981年莫运明担任房管科科长后，管理着82万多平方米的公房。他原在市内交通方便的桥北居委会有一套二室一厅的住房。但住了不久，4楼一位离休老干部找到他，反映自己患有高血压、心脏病，腿也不好使，要求老莫为他调整一套低层住房。莫运明想来想去，最后想到二楼自家那一套，就和这位老干部换了，老人的心愿满足了。1985年，市局在城内西正街9组新建一栋居民住房，供改造马路的搬迁户居住。为了多安排两个住房困难户，莫运明说服老伴、子女，全家搬出高楼，迁入建这栋新房时搭的工棚。这工棚，前面是个臭水塘，后面被从隔壁一所医院流出的污水围住。莫运明全家动手，填了臭水塘，又请来工匠修门窗，铺地面，安装水电，先后花了600多元。他说：“住的虽差一点，但心里踏实。”莫运明担任房管科长8年来，经他调整和分配的居民住房有1600多套，可他至今没有为自己安排一套。
