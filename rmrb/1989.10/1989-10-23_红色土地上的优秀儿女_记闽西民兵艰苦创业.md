Fujian Province's Longyan Region was a red base during the Great Revolution. Today, the total industrial and agricultural output value of this old revolutionary base has reached over 20 billion yuan, and since 1987, the poverty alleviation rate for rural impoverished households has reached 87%. In transforming the face of this old revolutionary base, the hundreds of thousands of militia in the Longyan Region have made significant contributions.

Militia squad leader Zhang Chunmao is a tough man. He led 11 militia members to hack through mountains, build bridges, and set up camp in the deep mountains and forests. When the new village he established—Xiaokenglu Village in Guting Town, Shanghang County—had to be marked on the map of Minxi, the seven households in this village had already planted 1,530 mu of forests, reclaimed 2,450 mu of bamboo mountains, and provided the state with 4,400 cubic meters of timber. They filled a room with the remaining half-used axes, sickles, hoes, and shoulder poles. Militia member Huang Xiangguang from Huangshan Village in Changping County's Chishui Township had used tree branches and bamboo for lighting and ground rice by hand for generations. He led the militia to climb cliffs and walk along steep walls, using tens of thousands of bamboo poles to bring in spring water to generate electricity, bringing "night pearls" to every household. Militia member Chen Yiting is a "man who deals with poisonous snakes." He traveled to Shaowu and Guangze, endured wind and rain, and visited many masters to learn snake breeding and processing techniques at his own expense. He utilized the abundant snake resources in Nanyang Township to establish a snake farm and signed a 50,000 yuan contract with the Wuyishan Snake Farm for the supply of snake products.

By the end of 1988, out of the original 43,600 impoverished militia households in the region, 41,800 had been lifted out of poverty. Few had smooth sailing, and many endured hardships. In the places where their predecessors fought to the death, they held aloft the torch of hard work and struggle even higher.

If individual militia members held up only the sparks of hard work and struggle, then the many militia groups striving across Minxi have formed a blazing momentum to change the face of the old revolutionary base.

In Guting Town, Shanghang County, where the "Guting Meeting" was held, small enterprises with militia as the main body can be found in every village. This year, the town's total industrial and agricultural output value can reach 100 million yuan. In Caixi Township, Shanghang County, the first model township in the Central Soviet Area, there is the saying "three thousand hammers and eight hundred axes." Construction teams with militia as the main body went to Shantou, Shenzhen, and Xiamen, from the old revolutionary base to the special economic zones, using hammers and axes to knock open the doors to prosperity. In Longyan and Yongding, more than 3,000 demobilized militia soldiers either pooled resources or bought vehicles at their own expense to form a vast transportation army, revitalizing the urban and rural economy and strengthening the connection between Minxi and the outside world.

Good training and education, strict organizational discipline, a daring and fighting spirit, and the advantage of youth and strength have made demobilized militia soldiers a uniquely capable fighting force recognized by all sectors in Minxi. In 1988 alone, the People's Armed Forces Departments of various counties (cities) in Minxi, in cooperation with relevant departments, held 274 training classes, training 11,000 demobilized militia soldiers, with a training rate of 100% for demobilized soldiers that year. According to the needs of developing a commodity economy, the People's Armed Forces Departments of various counties (cities) guided demobilized militia soldiers to take the path of collectivization, further enhancing the combat effectiveness of the militia. They dared to explore the deep mountains, compete in the special economic zones, and break out of the old revolutionary base.

The demobilized militia production base in Juxi Township, Liancheng County, in collaboration with Fujian University, operates a full-province activated white clay factory, producing "Fulian" activated white clay, which is exported to Japan, the Philippines, and other countries. In the Wudong 10,000-mu forest farm in Wuping County, a company of militia has been stationed on the mountain year-round to plant trees and fruits, with an annual citrus harvest of tens of thousands of jin. Hedian Town in Changting County is a national water and soil conservation experimental area. Every winter and spring, tens of thousands of militia form assault teams to plant grass and trees, treating over 100,000 mu of water and soil erosion.

In the past five years, the region's militia have planted 386,000 mu of trees and fruits, with 386 plots of 100-mu or more of continuous forest and fruit trees.

The militia groups in Minxi have a strong sense of collective identity and collective honor, not only excelling in material civilization construction but also taking the lead in spiritual civilization construction. The three brothers, demobilized soldiers Wang Dekang from Xiaguoche Village, donated 500,000 yuan interest-free to a neighboring village with 24 households earning less than 300 yuan per capita to build a cement factory, and later donated 45,000 yuan to build a nursing home and kindergarten. In recent years, the militia in Yongfu Township, Changping County, have donated 1.68 million yuan to build bridges, roads, and schools. Demobilized soldiers Luo Chunting and Xiao Bingwang from Longyan City have adopted measures such as directed recruitment, financial support, and technical assistance to establish 37 support-the-army enterprises, opening up employment opportunities for military dependents and disabled soldiers. The region currently has 3,840 militia learning from Lei Feng groups, volunteer service groups, and science and technology information dissemination groups, with 43,800 participants.

　　红色土地上的优秀儿女
　　——记闽西民兵艰苦创业
    福建省龙岩地区是大革命时期一块红色根据地。如今这个老区的工农业总产值已达20多亿元，从1987年以来农村贫困户脱贫率已达87％。在改变闽西这个老区的面貌中，龙岩地区的数十万民兵立下了汗马功劳。
    民兵排长张春茂是个硬汉子。他带领11名民兵劈山开路，断水架桥，到深山老林安营扎寨。当闽西版图上必须标上他创建的新村——上杭县古田镇小坑炉村时，这个村7户人家已营造山林1530亩，垦复竹山2450亩，向国家提供木材4400立方米，而他们用剩下的半截子斧头、镰刀、锄头、扁担摆满一个房间。民兵黄祥光所在的漳平县赤水乡黄山村，祖祖辈辈点树枝竹把照明，用人力舂米。他带领民兵攀悬崖、走峭壁，用成千上万根毛竹引来泉水发电，给家家户户送来了“夜明珠”。民兵陈以庭是位“与毒蛇打交道的人”。他跑邵武，上光泽，风餐露宿，广拜名师，自费学习养蛇和加工技术，利用南阳乡丰富的毒蛇资源办起了养蛇场，一次就与武夷山蛇场签订5万元的供给蛇类产品合同。
    到1988年止，全地区原有4.36万个民兵贫困户已有4.18万户脱贫。他们一帆风顺者少，历尽艰辛者多，在他们的前辈出生入死战斗过的地方，更高地举起了艰苦奋斗的火炬。
    如果单个民兵举起的只是艰苦奋斗的星星火炬，那么，奋斗在闽西大地的许多民兵群体，则形成了改变老区面貌的燎原之势。
    在“古田会议”旧址所在地上杭古田镇，近年来以民兵为主体的小企业村村都有。今年，这个镇工农业总产值可达亿元。在当年中央苏区的第一个模范乡——上杭县才溪乡，有“三千榔头八百斧”之说。以民兵为主体的建筑工程队跑汕头、下深圳、去厦门，从老区走向特区，用榔头斧头敲开了富裕之门。在龙岩、在永定，3000多名民兵退伍军人或集资、或自费购买汽车，组成了浩浩荡荡的运输大军，搞活了城乡经济，加强了闽西与外界的联系。
    良好的培养教育、严格的组织纪律，敢打敢拚的作风和年轻力壮的优势，使民兵退伍军人成了闽西各界公认的特别能战斗的队伍。闽西各县（市）人民武装部会同有关部门仅在去年就举办各类培训班274期，培训民兵退伍军人1.1万人，当年退伍军人培训率达100％。根据发展商品经济的需要，各县（市）人武部引导民兵退伍军人走群体化的道路，进一步提高了民兵队伍的战斗力。他们敢进深山探险，敢到特区拚搏，也敢冲出老区。
    连城县莒溪乡退伍军人基干民兵生产基地，与福州大学合办的全省活性白土厂，生产“福莲”活性白土，远销日本、菲律宾等国。在武平县武东万亩林场，一个连的民兵常年在山上育林种果，仅柑桔每年就可收获数万斤。长汀县河田镇是国家水土保持试验区，每年冬春季节，上万民兵组成突击队植草种树，治理水土流失已超过10万亩。
    近5年来，全区民兵种树种果38.6万亩，百亩以上的成片林果达386个。
    闽西民兵群体意识很强，集体荣誉感很强，不仅在物质文明建设中大显身手，在精神文明建设中也模范带头。下郭车村退伍军人王德康3兄弟勤劳致富，得知邻村24户人均收入不足300元的村民想利用当地资源办水泥厂，但苦于没有资金，便无息借给他们50万元，并先后捐款4.5万元办敬老院、幼儿园。漳平县永福乡基干民兵近年来捐资168万元，用于修桥铺路建学校。龙岩市退伍军人罗春亭、肖炳旺等人采取定向招工、资金扶持、技术帮助等办法，办起了37家拥军企业，为烈军属、残疾军人打开了就业之门。全区现有民兵学雷锋小组、义务帮工小组、科技信息传播小组3840多个，参加者达4.38万多人。
