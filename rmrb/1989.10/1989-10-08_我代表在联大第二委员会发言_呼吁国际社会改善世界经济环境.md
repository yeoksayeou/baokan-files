    China's Deputy Representative to the United Nations, Ding Yuanhong, spoke on October 5 at the 44th session of the UN General Assembly's Second Committee, calling on the international community to improve the external economic environment to support the economic development of developing countries.

    Ding Yuanhong proposed that the improvement of the external environment should be approached from two aspects. He said, "In the short to medium term, it is urgent to launch a new round of meaningful South-North dialogue. The international community should take more effective measures on a series of pressing issues such as reducing debt burdens, increasing financial aid, reducing trade barriers against developing countries, and stabilizing primary commodity prices. In the long term, the international community should strive to improve the mechanisms of international economic cooperation and the management of the world economic system, gradually establishing a fair and reasonable new international economic order."

    Ding Yuanhong pointed out, "It is particularly necessary at present to change the situation where a few major developed countries dominate major international economic decisions and to increase the participation of developing countries in decision-making."

    Ding Yuanhong emphasized, "The practice of harming others for one's own benefit and shifting difficulties is unacceptable. Economic exchanges between countries must adhere to the principles of mutual respect and equality."

    Ding Yuanhong also elaborated on China's government's stance on specific issues such as the Special Session on the World Economy, the International Development Strategy, debt, and the environment.

    我代表在联大第二委员会发言
    呼吁国际社会改善世界经济环境
    本报联合国电　记者刘开宸报道：中国常驻联合国副代表丁原洪大使10月5日在第44届联大第二委员会一般性辩论中发言，呼吁国际社会改善外部经济环境来支持发展中国家的经济发展。
    丁原洪提出这种外部环境的改善应从两方面着手。他说，“从中短期看，迫切需要展开新一轮有实质意义的南北对话。国际社会应当在减轻债务负担、增加资金援助、减少针对发展中国家的贸易壁垒、稳定初级产品价格等一系列紧迫问题上，采取更加有效的措施。从长期看，国际社会应当致力于改善国际经济合作机制和世界经济体系的管理，逐步建立一个公正的、合理的国际经济新秩序。”
    丁原洪指出，“当前尤其有必要改变由少数主要发达国家主宰重大国际经济决策的局面，提高发展中国家参与决策的程度。”
    丁原洪强调，“那种损人利己、转嫁困难的做法，是不能容忍的。国与国之间的经济交往必须遵循相互尊重、相互平等的原则。”
    丁原洪还就经济特别联大、国际发展战略、债务和环境等具体问题等阐明了中国政府的立场。
