    Editor:

    My neighbor, Wei, found out that his younger brother had stolen a 47cm color television and sold it for 2000 yuan. Wei then demanded to split the stolen money with his younger brother. Wei's younger brother refused, so Wei threatened, "If you don't agree, I'll go to the police station and report you." Wei's younger brother then gave Wei 1000 yuan, and Wei did not go to the police. Please ask: What kind of behavior is Wei's action? How does one determine if it is illegal and criminal?

    Qiu Rongxing:

    Wei's younger brother's behavior constitutes the crime of theft. After Wei found out about his younger brother's theft, he should have reported it to the authorities. However, he not only did not do so but also forcibly demanded the stolen money from his younger brother. This is an act of extortion.

    The characteristics of the crime of extortion are: with the intent of illegal possession, using threats or coercion against the victim to forcibly extort public or private property. Threats or coercion usually involve threatening the victim or their family with violence if they do not comply with the criminal's demands. Sometimes, it may involve threatening to expose the victim's secrets or threatening to destroy the victim's property. It could also involve taking advantage of the victim's desperate situation. In summary, regardless of the method used to threaten, as long as it causes the victim to fear and be forced to hand over property, it is an act of extortion. Wei used the threat of reporting his younger brother to the police to extort 1000 yuan from him, which is an act of extortion.

    The crime of extortion infringes upon the legal ownership of public and private property. Wei's stolen property, although illegal in the eyes of the thief, is not state or collective property but is legally owned by citizens. After Wei's younger brother's theft case is solved, the stolen property should be returned to its rightful owner. If the stolen property is a restricted item by the state, it should be seized and handed over to the judicial authorities. Wei used threats to extort the stolen money from his younger brother, which is no different from illegally possessing property from a legal owner. This is a harmful behavior to society and constitutes the crime of extortion. As for the punishment, Wei and his younger brother each have their own crimes and should be held responsible accordingly, both should be punished in accordance with the law.

    不报案索赃款属什么行为？
    编辑同志：
    我的邻居韦某发现弟弟盗窃了一台47厘米彩色电视机卖得2000元，便要求与弟弟平分赃款。韦弟不答应，韦某胁迫说：“你不同意，我就去派出所报案。”韦弟就分给了韦某1000元，韦某也就不去报案了。请问：韦某的做法属于什么行为？怎样才算违法犯罪？
  　邱荣星
    邱荣星同志：
    韦某的弟弟的行为已构成盗窃罪，韦某知道弟弟的盗窃问题后，本应报案，但是他不仅没有这样做，反而强行向弟弟索要赃款。这是敲诈勒索行为。
    敲诈勒索罪的特征是：以非法占有为目的，对被害人实施威胁或者要挟的方法，强索公私财物的行为。威胁或者要挟的方法，通常是以不答应罪犯的要求，将对被害人或者他的亲属，实施暴力相威胁；有的也可能是用揭发被害人隐私，或者以毁坏被害人的财产相威胁；有的可能利用被害人有求于自己的困境相威胁，等等。总之，不管采取什么方式和方法进行威胁，凡是足以使被害人产生恐惧而被迫交出财物的，就是敲诈勒索行为。韦某用不同意就去派出所报案的方式，威胁他的弟弟分给他1000元赃款的做法，属于敲诈勒索行为。
    敲诈勒索犯罪，侵犯的是公私财物的合法所有权。韦某的盗窃所得，对盗窃者来说是非法所得，但对被盗窃者来说，不是国家、集体的财物，便是公民合法所有的财物。韦某弟弟的盗窃案破获后，对所盗窃的财物，是谁的还应返还给谁。如果盗窃的财物属国家严禁的物品，应当由司法机关没收上缴。韦某采用威胁的方法，敲诈其弟弟所盗窃的赃款，这同从合法所有者手中非法占有财物，没有本质上的区别，同样是危害社会的行为，当然构成敲诈勒索罪。至于处理，韦某和他弟弟各有其罪，各负其责，均应依法予以惩罚。
