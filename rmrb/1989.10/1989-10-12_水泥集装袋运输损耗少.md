    Cement Transportation with Flexible Containers Reduces Waste

    Our reporter learned that the Shanghai Railway Bureau has promoted the use of flexible containers for cement transportation, achieving good social benefits. From January to August this year, 150,000 tons of cement were transported using these containers, reducing waste by 15,000 tons and creating a social benefit of 3 million yuan.

    In the past, cement was transported by rail in paper bags, with a natural loss rate of around 10%. The Shanghai Railway Bureau handles about 5 million tons of cement annually, with approximately 500,000 tons lost during transportation and handling, valued at nearly 100 million yuan. By promoting the use of flexible containers, the loss rate has been reduced to less than 1%.

    水泥集装袋运输损耗少
    本报讯　上海铁路局推广水泥柔性集装袋运输，取得良好的社会效益。今年1至8月，用集装袋运输水泥15万吨，减少损耗1.5万吨，创社会效益300万元。
    过去，铁路运输水泥用纸袋，自然损耗为10％左右，上海铁路局全年水泥运量为500万吨，其中有50万吨撒漏在货场和路上，价值近1亿元。推广水泥集装袋，损耗降至1％以下。（陈林）
