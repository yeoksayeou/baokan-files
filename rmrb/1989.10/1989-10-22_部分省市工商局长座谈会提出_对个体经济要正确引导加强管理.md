Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 21st.

From October 17th to 21st, directors of the industrial and commercial administrative bureaus from 15 provinces and cities convened in Beijing for a meeting. They unanimously agreed that developing multiple economic components with public ownership as the mainstay is a long-term policy of our party. On this issue, two tendencies must be noted: it is inappropriate to exaggerate the role of non-public ownership economies, overlook the mainstay position of public ownership, or even advocate "privatization." Conversely, it is also incorrect to emphasize public ownership as the mainstay while neglecting the encouragement and support of non-public ownership economies. Currently, individual and private economies should still be actively supported, while supervision and management must be strengthened to better utilize their positive roles and limit their negative impacts on socialist economic development.

It is reported that over the past decade of reform, China's individual and private economies have been restored and developed. By the end of 1988, there were 14.527 million individual industrial and commercial households and 23.049 million people engaged in this sector. However, there was a slight decrease in the first half of this year, with 12.34 million households and 19.43 million people by the end of June. There are 66,525 registered private enterprises with over 1.08 million employees. These enterprises contribute an annual tax revenue of 100 million yuan, increasing national income.

At the meeting, Zhang Zhonglin, Director of the State Industrial and Commercial Bureau, proposed the following tasks for local industrial and commercial administrative departments to strengthen the management of individual and private economies:

First, continue to support the development of individual and private economies. The development of specific industries and their scale should be guided based on local needs and conditions.

Second, strictly investigate and punish illegal business activities by individual households and private enterprises, resolutely cracking down on the production and sale of counterfeit goods and monopolistic practices.

Third, in collaboration with tax authorities, strengthen tax collection and management, educate individual household and private enterprise owners to pay taxes in accordance with the law, and prevent tax evasion.

Fourth, thoroughly clean up "fake collective" enterprises and rectify individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises registered under collective names.

Fifth, clean up and rectify unlicensed operations and strengthen the management of commodity markets.

　　部分省市工商局长座谈会提出
　　对个体经济要正确引导加强管理
    本报北京10月21日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：10月17日至21日，15个省市的工商行政管理局长在京座谈。他们一致认为，以公有制为主体发展多种经济成分，是我们党的一项长期方针。在这个问题上，要注意两种倾向：既不能不恰当地夸大非公有制经济的作用，忽视公有制经济的主体地位，甚至鼓吹“私有化”；也不能因强调以公有制为主体而忽视鼓励和扶持非公有制经济的发展。当前，对个体和私营经济仍然要积极扶持，同时必须加强监督管理，更好地发挥它们的积极作用，限制它们不利于社会主义经济发展的消极作用。
    据悉，改革10年来，我国个体和私营经济得到了恢复和发展。1988年底，全国有个体工商业户1452.7万户、2304.9万从业人员，今年上半年有所下降，到6月底为1234万户、1943万人。已登记的私营企业有66525户，职工108万余人。每年还上交税金10亿元，增加了国家收入。
    国家工商局局长任中林在座谈会上提出，为了加强对个体和私营经济管理，当前各地工商行政管理机关应抓好以下几项工作：
    第一，要继续扶持个体、私营经济的发展。发展哪些行业，发展多少，应根据各地需要和条件加以引导。
    第二，严格查处个体户和私营企业中的违法经营行为，坚决打击制售假冒商品、欺行霸市等违法活动。
    第三，配合税务机关加强税收征管，教育个体户和私营企业主依法纳税，制止偷漏税行为。
    第四，认真清理“假集体”企业，纠正以集体名义登记的个体工商户和私营企业。
    第五，清理整顿无照经营，加强集贸市场管理。
