October 14th is World Standards Day. On this day in 1946, representatives from 25 countries gathered in London to establish the International Organization for Standardization. China was one of the founding member countries.

In this year's World Standards Day activities, the theme chosen was "Health Technical Standards," focusing on the significant role of standardization in health care and medical technology. This is particularly meaningful for China—this year marks the first year of China's standardization work entering the rule-of-law stage. The "Standards Law of the People's Republic of China," which came into effect on April 1st of this year, emphasizes the management of safety and health-related technical standards. Article 7 of the law clearly states, "National and industry standards are divided into mandatory standards and recommended standards. Standards that ensure human health, personal safety, and property security, as well as those mandated by laws and administrative regulations, are mandatory standards; other standards are recommended standards."

In the area of safety and health standardization, both internationally and domestically, there have been many painful lessons. For example, on February 7, 1904, a severe fire occurred in Baltimore, Maryland. Firefighters from nearby Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and nine other cities rushed to the scene, but due to the different diameters of the fire hose couplings and hydrant connections, they were unable to connect, rendering the firefighters helpless as they watched the flames consume millions of dollars' worth of property. Another example is the 1962 earthquake in Morocco, where needles and syringes from various countries could not be used due to differing taper standards, leading to adverse consequences.

The broad practice of standardization also involves many other important aspects, such as mutual understanding, environmental protection, product performance and applicability, variety control, and protecting consumers' interests. In today's world, through the combination of microprocessors and automated production, people's diverse needs in life will be increasingly satisfied. However, the promotion and application of information technology itself rely on a high degree of standardization. Without standardization and unification in areas such as computer languages and information codes, the widespread use of computers and microprocessors, the establishment of information databases, and the realization of computer networking and information resource sharing would be impossible. Therefore, with the advent of the new technological revolution in the world, the prospects for standardization will be even broader.

    标准化能促进现代化
    ——写在又一个世界标准日
    顾孟洁
    10月14日，是世界标准日。在1946年的这一天，25个国家的代表在伦敦开会，决定成立国际标准化组织。我国是创始成员国之一。
    在本届世界标准日活动中，选择了“卫生技术标准”这个主题，即要围绕卫生保健和医疗技术这个重点宣传标准化的突出作用。这对我国来说是特别意味深长的事——今年是我国标准化工作开始进入法治阶段的第一年，定于今年4月1日起施行的《中华人民共和国标准化法》的重要特点之一就是强化了对安全、卫生方面的技术标准的管理。该法第7条明确规定“国家标准、行业标准分为强制性标准和推荐性标准。保障人体健康，人身、财产安全的标准和法律、行政法规规定强制执行的标准是强制性标准，其他标准是推荐性标准。”
    在有关安全和卫生的标准化工作方面，国际和国内都有过不少沉痛的教训。如1904年2月7日美国巴尔的摩市发生严重火灾，附近的华盛顿、费城、纽约等9个城市的消防队都迅速赶来援救，但由于各地消防车水龙带和消火栓接头的口径不同，连接不上，致使从各地赶来的消防队员们无法施展，只好眼巴巴地看着熊熊烈火把千百万美元的财产化为灰烬。又如1962年摩洛哥发生地震后，从世界各地运来的针头和针管，由于各国所采用的锥度不统一，而造成了不良后果。
    标准化的广泛实践其目的还涉及其他许多重要的方面，诸如：相互理解、环境保护、产品性能及其适用性、品种控制、保护消费者的利益，等等。在当今世界，通过微处理机和生产自动化相结合，人们在生活中的多样化需求将得到愈来愈多的满足，然而信息技术手段的推广应用本身就有赖于高度的标准化。如果没有计算机语言和信息代码等等方面的标准化和统一化，计算机和微处理机的推广应用、信息库的建立和实现计算机连网、信息资源共享是完全不可能的。因此，随着世界新技术革命的到来，标准化的前景将更加广阔。
