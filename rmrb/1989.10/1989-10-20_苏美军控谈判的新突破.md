On September 29, the 12th round of nuclear and space arms control negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States began in Geneva. This round of negotiations attracted particular attention because, before it started, the strategic arms talks, which had been at a standstill for more than a year, had made new progress.

On September 21, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze handed a long letter from Chairman Gorbachev to President Bush at the White House and then held two days of talks with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker. Afterward, he announced that even if a Soviet-American agreement on space weapons had not been completed, the Soviet Union would be prepared to reach an agreement with the United States on reducing strategic weapons. International opinion considered this to mean that the Soviet Union had officially abandoned its long-held position of linking the reduction of strategic weapons with the prohibition of space weapons, representing a major concession by the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet Union agreed to negotiate the limitation of sea-launched cruise missiles as a separate agreement and pledged to unilaterally dismantle the controversial Krasnoyarsk large radar station. People believed that the change in the Soviet Union's attitude had multiple causes.

In March 1985, when the Soviet Union and the United States began negotiations on strategic, intermediate, and space weapons, the Soviet Union insisted on a comprehensive solution to the three items, aiming to use the negotiations on strategic and intermediate weapons to pressure the United States to abandon the then-ascendant "Strategic Defense Initiative." At that time, the Soviet Union insisted that the reduction of strategic weapons must be linked to the limitation of space weapons and that reaching an agreement on limiting space weapons was a "necessary precondition" for reaching an agreement on reducing strategic nuclear weapons. However, with the development of the international situation and changes in the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, over the years, the Soviet Union has repeatedly changed its position on the issue of "linkage" versus "delinkage." During the Reykjavik summit between the two countries in 1986, the two sides had reached a consensus on reducing strategic weapons by 50%, but ultimately got stuck on the issue of linking with space weapons, resulting in the summit being fruitless and no concrete results being achieved. By the end of 1987, the Soviet Union and the United States had reached an agreement on intermediate-range weapons alone, allowing the intermediate-range missiles to "delink" and go their separate way. To utilize the momentum of the intermediate-range missile treaty to further expand the results of arms control negotiations, Gorbachev, on the eve of the 1987 Washington summit, told American reporters that the "Strategic Defense Initiative" was not a topic for negotiation, and that as long as the United States did not violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, it would be fine, thus showing a flexible attitude on the linkage issue. But by the time of the 1988 Moscow summit, the Soviet Union's position had retreated again, clearly stating that strict adherence to the anti-missile treaty was a precondition for reaching an agreement to reduce strategic weapons by 50%, showing a rigid stance. After that, the Soviet Union showed no signs of softening on the linkage issue.

Observers believe that from the Moscow summit to now, in just over a year, the Soviet Union unexpectedly announced the abandonment of the linkage principle, making a 180-degree turn, which seems to have both immediate needs and long-term considerations.

From a military perspective, at present, the nuclear weapons of the Soviet Union and the United States together account for 97% of the world's total nuclear weapons. Even if they are reduced by half, they will still account for more than 90% of the total. Moreover, with the development of nuclear technology, both sides' nuclear weapons are constantly being updated and replaced, with a large number of outdated nuclear armaments available for reduction. This way, more military funds can be used to develop high-tech weapon projects to compete in the high-tech field. In addition, the Strategic Defense Initiative, which the Soviet Union has long opposed, has now been significantly reduced by the United States, with the actual deployment time clearly delayed, and even if it is deployed one day, its reliability is highly questionable. Moreover, the Soviet Union is also developing its own "Star Wars" plan, whose level and scale are not inferior to that of the United States. Therefore, under the current circumstances, delinking the reduction of strategic weapons from the prohibition of space weapons will not have a significant impact on the Soviet Union's security interests.

On the other hand, since Bush took office, the United States has been cautious in its attitude toward the Soviet Union and has not taken any major steps in bilateral relations. In the field of arms control, Bush seems to have paid more attention to conventional arms reductions in Europe, while being less enthusiastic about reaching a strategic weapons agreement. The Soviet Union is not without anxiety about this. Arms control is the core of Soviet-American relations, and the reduction of strategic weapons is the key to arms control. Although conventional arms reductions in Europe are important, strategic weapons negotiations are more directly related to the Soviet Union and the United States. In the Soviet Union's view, to promote the development of Soviet-American relations and maintain the momentum of détente, it is necessary to make progress in the reduction of strategic weapons. Therefore, the Soviet Union made a significant concession to demonstrate its sincerity and determination to push forward Soviet-American relations and East-West détente, hoping that Soviet-American relations could maintain the warmth of the Reagan era and create a relatively stable international environment for the Soviet Union's reforms and development.

Moreover, the domestic situation in the Soviet Union is also quite severe, and the resistance to reform is beginning to emerge. It seems that the Soviet leadership's major concession in the Soviet-American arms control negotiations may also be a consideration to make up for the shortcomings of economic reform achievements and improve the domestic situation.

International opinion generally believes that the Soviet Union's proactive actions have injected vitality into the long-standing superpower arms control negotiations. Although the Soviet Union's concessions still leave some room, and there are still some serious differences between the two sides, based on the results of the previous 11 rounds of negotiations, a draft treaty on reducing strategic weapons by 50% has already had a basic framework. The positions of both sides in the 12th round of negotiations, which has just begun, will further converge. If no major setbacks occur to affect the progress of the negotiations, the possibility of the Soviet Union and the United States reaching an agreement next year seems to have increased.

    苏美军控谈判的新突破
    周爱群
    9月29日，苏美第12轮核与外空军控谈判在日内瓦开始举行。这一轮谈判所以特别引人注目，是因为在谈判开始之前，僵持了一年多之久的战略武器谈判有了新的突破。
    9月21日，苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽在白宫向布什总统转交了戈尔巴乔夫主席的一封长信，接着与美国国务卿贝克举行了两天会谈。在那之后，他宣布，即使在苏美有关太空武器的协定还未完成时，苏联也将准备同美国达成一项削减战略武器的条约。国际舆论认为，这表明苏联正式放弃了它长期坚持的削减战略武器与禁止太空武器直接挂钩的立场，是苏联作出的一个重大让步。此外，苏联还同意把限制海基巡航导弹作为单项协议另行谈判，并承诺单方面拆除有争议的克拉斯诺亚尔斯克大型雷达站。人们认为，苏联态度的这一变化是有多种原因的。
    1985年3月，苏美就战略、中程和太空三类武器开始进行谈判时，苏联是把三项谈判放在一起，主张一揽子解决的，目的是借战略武器和中程武器谈判来压美国放弃当时正方兴未艾的“战略防御计划”。当时，苏联坚持削减战略武器必须与限制太空武器挂钩，并将达成限制太空武器协议作为达成削减战略核武器协议的“必要的先决条件”。但是，随着国际形势的发展和苏联国内局势的变化，几年来，苏联在“挂钩”还是“脱钩”问题上几经反复。1986年苏美首脑冰岛会晤时，双方已就削减50％战略武器达成一致，但最终还是在与太空武器挂钩问题上卡了壳，致使会晤前功尽弃，没有取得具体的成果。1987年底，苏联与美国单独就中程武器达成了协议，让中导“脱钩”而去。为了利用中导条约的冲击波来进一步扩大裁军谈判的成果，戈尔巴乔夫在1987年底华盛顿首脑会晤前夕，对美国记者发表谈话称，“战略防御计划不是谈判的题目，只要美国不违反反弹道导弹条约就行”，从而在挂钩问题上表明了灵活的态度。但到1988年莫斯科首脑会晤时，苏联的立场又缩了回去，明确表示把严格遵守反导条约作为达成裁减50％战略武器条约的先决条件，表现了僵硬的立场。在此之后，苏联在挂钩问题上没有表现出任何松动的迹象。
    观察家们认为，从莫斯科首脑会晤迄今，时隔仅一年多，苏联此次出人意料地宣布放弃挂钩原则，陡然来个180度大转弯，看来既有当前的需要，又有长远的考虑。
    从军事角度看，目前苏美核武器加在一起，已占全世界核武器总数的97％，即使削减一半，也还占总数的90％以上。而且随着核技术的发展，双方的核武器都在不断更新换代，有大量过时核军备可供削减，这样可以将更多的军费用于发展高精尖武器项目，以便在高技术领域进行新的争夺。此外，苏联多年来一直予以反对的战略防御计划，现在美国已经作了很大的缩减，不仅实际部署时间明显推迟，而且，即使有朝一日能够部署，其可靠程度也大可怀疑。更何况苏联也在发展自己的“星战计划”，其水平和规模并不亚于美国。所以，在当前情况下，削减战略武器与禁止太空武器脱钩，不会对苏联的安全利益造成多大影响。
    另一方面，自从布什就任总统以来，美国对苏态度谨慎，在两国关系方面迄今未采取大的步骤，在裁军领域中，布什似乎把更多的注意力放在欧洲常规裁军上，而对达成战略武器协议不甚积极。苏联对此不无焦虑。裁军是苏美关系的核心，削减战略武器更是裁军的重头戏。欧洲常规裁军固然重要，但战略武器谈判更与苏美直接关连。在苏联看来，要推动苏美关系发展，保持缓和的势头，非在裁减战略武器上下手不可。因此，苏联就以较大的让步来表明它推进苏美关系和东西方缓和的诚意与决心，希望苏美关系能保持里根时代的热乎程度，为苏联的改革和发展争取相对稳定的国际环境。
    还有，苏联国内形势也比较严峻，改革的阻力正在显露出来。看来，苏联领导人在苏美军控谈判上作出这一重大让步，恐怕也有借外交上的成就来弥补经济改革成果的不足，以改善在国内的处境的考虑。
    国际舆论普遍认为，苏联的主动行动为旷日持久的超级大国军控谈判注入了活力。虽然苏联的让步仍然留有一定的余地，双方又还存在一些严重的分歧，但在前11轮谈判的基础上，一项关于削减50％战略武器的条约草案已经有了基本的框架。双方在刚刚开始的第12轮谈判中的立场还会进一步靠拢。如果不发生影响谈判进程的大波折，经过进一步的讨价还价，苏美在明年达成协议的可能性看来还是增加了。
