Lawson's Resignation Sparks Major Controversy
British Prime Minister Faces New Pressures

	According to Xinhua News Agency, London, October 27, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson suddenly resigned on the 26th, causing a major uproar in Britain. The result was not only a reshuffle of the cabinet, which had just been reorganized three months ago, but also the most serious crisis faced by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in her 10 years of governance.

	The reason for Lawson's resignation was ostensibly due to his disagreement with the Prime Minister's economic advisor, Alan Walters, on economic policy, making it impossible for him to effectively implement the government's economic policies. However, political analysts believe that this was actually the result of long-term disagreements between him and the Prime Minister. Thatcher explicitly stated that as long as she is Prime Minister, she will not join the European Monetary System, because there is a sovereignty issue involved. Lawson, on the other hand, believes that to stabilize the pound, it is necessary to link it with the currencies of the EEC countries, and Britain should join the system as soon as possible.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, London, October 29, the British news media reported that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faced new pressures on the 28th due to two of her most important cabinet members challenging her authority.

	British Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe reignited the debate over whether Britain should join the European Monetary System, an issue that led to Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's sudden resignation.

	In his speech in Bath, England, Howe supported Britain's joining the European Monetary System and praised Lawson as a "courageous minister."

	Meanwhile, the newly appointed Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd warned Thatcher not to interfere too much in foreign affairs.

	Recently, a poll conducted by the Sunday Times showed that the Conservative Party's approval rating lagged behind the opposition Labour Party by 10 percentage points, dropping from 43% last month to 38%.

　　劳森辞职引起轩然大波
　　英国首相面临新的压力
    据新华社伦敦10月27日电  英国财政大臣劳森26日突然辞职在英国引起一场轩然大波，结果不仅导致了刚改组三个月的内阁再次改组，而且使首相撒切尔夫人遇到了执政10年以来最严重的危机。
    劳森辞职的原因，表面上是因为他同首相的经济顾问沃尔特斯在经济政策上意见不合，使他无法有效实施政府的经济政策。但政治分析家们认为，其实是他和首相长期龃龉的结果。撒切尔夫人明确表示，只要她当首相，决不加入欧洲货币体系，因为这里有个主权问题。而劳森认为，为了稳定英镑，必须同欧共体各国货币挂钩，英国应尽早加入该体系。
    据新华社伦敦10月29日电  据英国新闻界报道，英国首相撒切尔夫人28日晚由于两名最重要内阁成员对她的权力发表挑战性讲话而面临新的压力。
    英国副首相杰弗里·豪重新发起针对英国是否加入欧洲货币体系的争论，这个问题导致财政大臣劳森突然辞职。
    豪在新英格兰巴斯城的讲话中支持英国加入欧洲货币体系，并称赞劳森是位“具有勇气的大臣”。
    与此同时，新任外交大臣赫德警告撒切尔夫人不要对外交事务干预太多。
    最近由《星期日泰晤士报》举行的一次民意测验表明，保守党的得票率比反对党工党落后了10个百分点，由上个月43％的得票率下降到38％。
