This morning, at the State Council's Premier's Office meeting, Comrade Yè Qīng from the State Planning Commission reported on the situation of the national production work conference. This meeting was timely and necessary. Now, I will discuss a few points on the current economic situation and the policies that should be adopted, hoping to draw the attention of the entire Party and all levels of government.

The economic situation in our country is changing rapidly, generally moving in the predetermined direction. After more than a year of rectification and rectification, the market has undergone significant changes. The rate of price increases has been gradually decreasing month by month, the market is relatively stable, and many commodities have shifted from the previous seller's market of supply shortage to a buyer's market of oversupply. The financial situation has improved. Last year, savings saw a significant decline, and the money supply increased rapidly. After implementing the value-preserving savings, urban and rural savings increased significantly, and the money backflow situation is relatively good. The high growth rate of industrial production has been brought down. Regions that previously had high growth rates, such as Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, have also seen their rates decrease.

The emergence of the above situations has led people to question: What is the current economic situation in our country? Is it good or bad? Is the policy of rectification and rectification correct? Should it be continued? What is the relationship between rectification and reform and opening up? We should give correct answers to these questions.

I think, first of all, we should have a correct and objective assessment of the current economic situation. From the situation mentioned above, it should be affirmed that the rectification and rectification have achieved initial results. However, we must also see that the current economy still faces difficulties. This is the result of years of total demand exceeding total supply and national income being over-distributed. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, some Western countries imposed economic sanctions on us, which also had some impact on our economy. Internal and external factors have brought some difficulties to our country's economy. We hope that through rectification and rectification, we can achieve a comprehensive balance of the national economy, reduce the contradiction between total demand and total supply, make the economic structure more reasonable, bring down long-term products, and bring up short-term products, so that the entire national economy can develop sustainably, stably, and harmoniously.

Currently, the market is stable, and the prices of people's daily necessities are stable with a slight decrease. In September, the retail price index for 35 large and medium-sized cities nationwide dropped to 9.7%. It is slightly higher in rural areas, with a national average of 12% to 13%. This is a significant decrease from the 26% to 27% at the beginning of the year. Banks have implemented value-preserving savings, and people's psychology towards purchasing goods has undergone significant changes. They feel that savings are beneficial and no longer rush to buy.

This year, we have made great efforts to reduce basic construction by 10%. Originally, we planned to reduce it by 20%. It seems that this goal will not be achieved. Economic development has its objective laws, and it is not possible to simply issue an order to stop everything. Doing so would result in greater losses. Therefore, on the one hand, we must take decisive measures to reduce it, and on the other hand, we must also consider economic benefits and allow some projects with small completion work to be completed and put into production. I recently visited some areas in the Northeast and had discussions with some construction enterprise comrades. They unanimously agreed that basic construction will decrease next year. The basis for this is the tightening of monetary policy, the reduction of basic construction investment; another important reason is that there are fewer new projects. However, it cannot be reduced immediately because there are still many ongoing and completion projects. Next year, basic construction will decrease, directly affecting the machinery industry, as the machinery industry mainly serves basic construction. It will also affect consumption, as about 40% of basic construction investment will be converted into consumption funds.

Rectification and rectification is a very complex process. Only by enduring a few years of hardship, uniting as one, and working hard can we overcome the difficulties. However, some local and departmental leaders have not truly accepted this view in their thoughts and actual work. They have different assessments of the situation from the central government, feeling that the situation in their region or department is still good and can be developed rapidly. They believe that as long as they loosen the monetary policy and issue more money, everything will be fine. Issuing money is easy, but after issuing money, there must be goods to back it up. Our country's national income has been over-distributed for many years, and issuing more money will only exacerbate inflation. When we go to the grassroots level, we encounter local leaders or they come to Beijing to talk to us, and there are always two things they want to discuss. The first is how prices are controlled. Various places have taken many measures, such as Heilongjiang's "383 Project" and other regions' "Vegetable Garden to Vegetable Basket" projects, which are good and effective.

The second thing is still about projects, investments, and money. They have not seriously considered how to carry out rectification and rectification, how to reduce basic construction, and how to adjust the industrial structure. They still follow the trend. Recently, I went to Baotou and visited several enterprises, and the situation is still good. In the evening, I listened to the city's report, and I said, today we will not discuss development plans, but how to improve the technical transformation of existing enterprises, how to prevent product accumulation, and how to improve efficiency. Our country has a plan to achieve the "doubling" strategic goal by the end of this century. However, without the current three years or more of rectification and rectification, it will be impossible to achieve the "doubling" goal. Please convey this message to the provincial party secretary and governor when you return, and now all levels of leadership must fully realize the severity of the economic situation and focus their main efforts on rectification and rectification.

In recent years, we have repeatedly introduced production lines for color TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, microcomputers, cars, suits, pull-top cans, cosmetics, and more than ten other types. Our country is a developing socialist country, implementing a planned commodity economy, which is a planned economy plus market regulation. Without market regulation, the economy will stagnate and become rigid; if it develops blindly without a plan, everyone does what they want, it will result in a great waste of financial and material resources. I mentioned earlier that more than ten types of production lines, please think, after the market becomes sluggish, what should be done with these production lines? Of course, people are always smart, "when the car reaches the mountain, there will be a way," "after the willows and flowers, there will be another village," there will always be a way. However, please think, how much money and what price will this blind development waste!

For the current economic situation, we should neither be pessimistic nor despairing. We should see that some situations are problems that are entirely possible to appear during the rectification and rectification process, and the economy is generally developing towards a virtuous cycle; we should also pay attention to the difficulties encountered at present and truly make up our minds to further improve the rectification and rectification. Comrade Jiang Zemin said that rectification and rectification create conditions for deepening reform and ensuring the healthy development of reform, and being unenthusiastic about rectification and rectification is also being unenthusiastic about reform. This is completely correct. Now, some products have a buyer's market, which has brought many difficulties to factories, especially to township enterprises. However, it also provides us with an opportunity to improve enterprise quality. If it were a seller's market, enterprises would increase varieties and improve product quality, reduce production costs, and there would be no motivation. No matter what, the market would sell it, and some would even be in short supply. Now is a good time for enterprises to transform, and efforts should be made in technological innovation, strengthening management, increasing varieties, improving product quality, saving energy and materials, reducing costs, strengthening matching, improving services, and speeding up the domestication of imported equipment. We should truly shift from focusing only on speed and scale and increasing income through price increases to truly improving enterprise economic benefits. Local governments should also increase fiscal revenue through improving economic benefits.

Regarding this issue, the leading comrades of each province and city must pay sufficient attention. They must truly mobilize the masses, create necessary conditions for factories and enterprises, provide correct guidance, and make enterprises use the current conditions and opportunities to develop more healthily. It should be seen that through ten years of reform and opening up, we have introduced a large number of advanced technologies and equipment, and a considerable part of them has not been combined with China's situation for promotion and benefit realization. In recent years, we have also trained and fostered a large number of engineering and technical personnel and enterprise managers, whose horizons are broader than before, and their management capabilities have improved. All this shows that the potential in enterprises is very great.

The second issue, I want to reiterate, our policy of reform and opening up and a series of policies will not change, maintaining the stability and continuity of the policy. The direction of reform and opening up is correct and must be adhered to. Some specific policies of reform need to be gradually improved and deepened. For example, the enterprise contract responsibility system has a positive role in mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of enterprises and employees, ensuring fiscal revenue, especially in overcoming difficulties at present. However, it indeed has some imperfect aspects that need to be gradually improved, mainly how to correctly handle the relationship between the state, enterprises, and individuals, and how to solve the problem of unfair distribution. The contract conditions are mostly negotiated one-on-one, and the taxes and profits paid are not a standard for an industry. This situation inevitably brings some unreasonable factors; moreover, the objective conditions of some enterprises are different, and the prices and market conditions of some products are not determined by themselves. Therefore, the amount of enterprise profits and the level of benefits are sometimes not completely determined by the good or bad management of the enterprise. If these are not considered in the contract, some enterprises will feel unreasonable and unfair. Under the current conditions, it is impossible to achieve complete fairness and reasonableness, but it should be made relatively fair. The contract responsibility system should continue to develop, and the form of the contract should be retained, but the contract conditions should be gradually improved. For example, with the growth of production, the self-owned working capital of enterprises should grow simultaneously and should be considered as one of the contract conditions. The growth of fixed assets, the reduction of short-term behavior, etc., should also be considered. Similarly, the factory director responsibility system and the strengthening of political and ideological work by the enterprise party committee are both to be adhered to and improved, and the factory director's command over production and operation must not be weakened.

Now, a relatively big problem is how to develop township enterprises. The high production speed of township enterprises needs to be controlled. In the first quarter of this year, the growth rate of township enterprises' output value still exceeded 20%, and now it has dropped to below 10%. Emphasizing the role of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises is not to restrict the development of township enterprises. In the primary stage of socialism, we allow the existence and development of private economy, let alone that a considerable part of township enterprises are collective enterprises. They play a significant role in arranging rural surplus labor, improving rural economic structure, implementing industrial support for agriculture, increasing investment in agriculture, promoting agricultural modernization, increasing farmers' income, and providing fiscal revenue for the state and local governments. The achievements of township enterprises must be affirmed. We do not agree with Comrade Zhao Ziyang's inappropriate exaggeration of the role of township enterprises and the attempt to introduce some unhealthy factors of township enterprises into state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, but we do not deny the important role of township enterprises. The main problem of township enterprises is how to utilize local raw materials and materials in rural areas. The market for township enterprises, in addition to a part in cities, should mainly be in rural areas, providing agricultural production and daily necessities for farmers. Some township enterprises can form scale economies and achieve scale benefits in a certain type of product. But most township enterprises now rely on relatively favorable conditions and relatively cheap labor to support them. The reason why Lu Guanqiu's "Universal Joint Factory" can stand firm is that it has formed batch production. With batches, it can compete. Many township enterprises cannot do this. Therefore, in the current situation of product stagnation, how to consolidate, improve, and transform is a big problem facing township enterprises. In summary, for township enterprises, we must affirm their role and make them adapt to the new situation, strive to improve technological and management levels, improve product structure, and improve product quality, so that they can continue to develop appropriately.

For individual and private enterprises, there should also be correct policies. Individual and private economies are necessary supplements to the socialist economy. Farmers have some products that need to be circulated through small traders. Our policy towards them is to protect legal operations and crack down on illegal ones, and to strictly collect taxes according to regulations. Currently, the most serious illegal behavior of individual businesses is tax evasion, with a large scale, reaching 70% to 80% in some places. In short, for individual and private economies, we should both play their positive role and limit their negative factors. For those engaged in wholesale, we should appropriately restrict them and not allow them to make big money by speculating and long-distance trading. This not only causes unfair social distribution but also has a destructive effect on society. But we should not go too far, as if individual and private economies are not allowed to exist now.

There are also fiscal contracts, foreign trade contracts, and industry contracts, which are currently all implemented according to the existing policy and will not be easily changed. If changed, it will be discussed with the local government in advance. This is actually a matter of adjusting interests. The relationship between the central government, local governments, enterprises, and individuals must be handled well, and the overall goal is to promote production development.

Finally, I want to talk about one more issue, which is to truly endure a few years of hardship. The series of anti-corruption measures that have been introduced must be implemented resolutely and without wavering. Since the implementation of our anti-corruption measures, social purchasing power has been compressed, the trend of extravagant spending has been curbed, and social ethics have improved. Have the enterprises stopped the trend of extravagant spending? The document issued by the central government on banquets and gifts does not have specific regulations for enterprises. However, there is a sentence that requires enterprises, including state-owned and collective enterprises, to refer to the implementation. Local governments should guide enterprises on the trend of extravagant spending. Saying that nothing can be done without feasting and drinking is not a socialist principle; it is a vulgar style. If feasting and drinking are necessary to get things done, then not feasting and drinking can also get things done, isn't that better?

There is another matter, which is the most troublesome issue for enterprises, the issue of levies. Local governments and various departments all extend their hands to enterprises from all directions. Should this also be taken as a part of anti-corruption construction? Some cities have roads that are too wide, and high-rise buildings have been built too many. Where does the money come from? We have investigated, and local finance does not have much money, most of it comes from levies. We must endure a few years of hardship, and local governments must make a decision to stop these things during these few years. Those that are already in progress should be maintained, and then gradually developed. Who doesn't want to build a few more tall buildings, build a few more stadiums, and widen the roads? But some have been built too early. During the period of rectification and rectification, it should be stopped. Urban reconstruction should also be stopped or slowed down, otherwise, enterprises cannot bear it. Enterprises are in great difficulty, they have to bear the pressure of the market, and also the pressure of workers' wages and bonuses. Therefore, a decision must be made: first, require enterprises to eat and drink less, truly implement increased production and savings, and work hard; second, take strict measures to stop levies on enterprises. In this way, a relatively good condition can be created for enterprises to overcome difficulties. At the same time, enterprises themselves should also use the existing funds well for technological transformation, increase varieties, and improve product quality. After three years of rectification and rectification, enterprises will change their appearance. The growth of economic strength is not only reflected in the quantity of products but should mainly be reflected in the quality of products.

In summary, all levels of leading cadres should see the severity of the current economic situation, but they must also establish confidence, muster courage, overcome difficulties, and use the opportunity of the decline in industrial production speed and market stagnation to improve enterprise quality. Through rectification and rectification and deepening reform, it is highly hopeful that the economy can achieve sustainable, stable, and coordinated development.

　　正确认识当前的经济形势
    进一步搞好治理整顿
    ——一九八九年十月十一日在全国生产工作会议上的讲话
　　李鹏
    今天上午在国务院总理办公会议上，国家计委叶青同志汇报了全国生产工作会议的情况。这个会开得很及时，很必要。现在我就当前的经济形势，应该采取的方针，讲几点意见，希望能引起全党和各级政府的重视。
    我国的经济形势变化得很快，总的是朝着预定的方向发展。经过一年多的治理整顿，市场发生了很大的变化，物价上涨幅度逐月回落，市场比较平稳，相当多的商品由过去供不应求的“卖方市场”，变成了供大于求的“买方市场”。金融状况有所改善。去年的储蓄是大幅度下降，货币发行量增加很快；实行了保值储蓄以后，城乡储蓄大幅度增加，货币回笼情况比较好。工业生产过高的增长速度已经降下来。过去增长速度一直很高的地区，广东、福建、山东、江苏、浙江等省的速度也下来了。
    出现以上情况，使人们产生了疑问：我国的经济形势究竟怎么样？是好还是坏？治理整顿方针究竟对不对，应不应该继续坚持下去？治理整顿和改革开放是什么关系？对于这些问题，我们应该作出正确的回答。
    我想，首先，对于目前的经济形势应该有一个正确的、客观的估计。从上面讲的情况看，应该肯定，治理整顿取得了初步成效。但是，也要看到，目前的经济还是有困难的。这是多年来社会总需求超过总供给，国民收入超分配的结果。平息反革命暴乱以后，某些西方国家对我们实行经济制裁，对我们的经济也有一定影响。内部原因，加上外部的原因，给我国经济带来一些困难。我们希望经过治理整顿，取得国民经济的综合平衡，缩小总需求和总供给之间的矛盾，使经济结构趋于合理，长线产品压下来，短线产品搞上去，使整个国民经济持续、稳定、协调地向前发展。
    目前，市场是稳定的，人民生活必需品的价格稳中有降。9月份，全国35个大中城市的零售物价上涨指数降到9.7％，农村高一点，全国平均为12％至13％。这比年初的26％、27％下降很多。银行实行保值储蓄，人民购买商品的心理状况发生了很大变化，觉得存款有利，不去抢购了。
    今年以来，我们花了很大力气把基本建设压缩了10％。原来想压20％。看来达不到。经济发展有它的客观规律，不是下个命令，叫它关停就能全停下来。那样做，会带来更大的损失。所以，我们一方面要采取坚决的压缩措施，另外一方面也要讲究经济效益，允许有些收尾工作量不大的项目建成投产。我最近到东北一些地区作了调查研究，同一些施工企业的同志进行了座谈。他们一致认为，到明年，基本建设会下来。根据是银根收缩，基本建设投资压缩；还有一个很重要的原因是，新开工项目少了。但现在一下子压不下来，因为还有许多在建和收尾项目。明年基本建设下降，直接受影响的是机械工业，因为机械工业基本上是为基本建设服务的。还会影响到消费，基本建设投资约有40％要转化为消费基金。
    治理整顿是一个很复杂的过程，只有过几年紧日子，团结一致，艰苦奋斗，才能渡过难关。但是，现在有些地方和部门的领导，在思想上和实际工作中还没有真正接受这个观点。他们对形势的估计和中央不完全一样，觉得我这个地区或这个部门形势还不错，可以大发展，只要把银根放松一点，多发点票子就行了。发票子很容易，可是发了票子，后面得有物资作保证。我国国民收入超分配已经多年了，再多发票子，结果只能是加剧通货膨胀。我们到基层去，碰到地方领导同志，或者他们到北京来找我们谈，有两件事总是要谈的。第一件，物价是怎么控制的。各地采取了很多措施，例如，黑龙江的“383工程”，其他地区以“菜园子”保“菜篮子”工程都是好的，有成效的。
　　第二件，还是要项目、要投资、要票子。没有认真考虑怎么样搞治理整顿，怎么压基本建设，怎么调整产业结构，还是一股上的风。最近我到包头去，看了几个企业，情况还是不错的。晚上听市里汇报，我说，今天我们不谈发展规划，而谈怎样搞好现有企业的技术改造，怎样使产品不积压，怎样提高效益。我们国家是有个分三步走的规划，到本世纪末达到“翻两番”的战略目标。但是离开目前三年或更长一点时间的治理整顿，就不可能达到“翻两番”的目标。请你们回去以后，给省委书记、省长带个信息，现在各级领导一定要充分认识到经济形势的严峻性，把主要精力放到治理整顿上来。
    这几年我们重复引进的生产线，有彩电、电冰箱、洗衣机、空调器、微机、汽车、西服、易拉罐、化妆品等十几种。我国是发展中的社会主义国家，实行有计划的商品经济，是计划经济加市场调节。如果没有市场调节，经济就会死水一潭，搞得很死；而如果无计划地盲目发展，大家想搞什么就搞什么，则会造成财力、物力的极大浪费。我刚才讲的十几种生产线，请大家想想，市场疲软以后，这些生产线怎么办？当然人总是聪明的，“车到山前必有路”，“柳暗花明又一村”，办法总是有的。但是，请大家想想，这种盲目的发展要浪费多少资金，付出多大的代价啊！
    对现在的经济形势，我们既不要悲观失望，要看到有些情况是治理整顿过程中完全可能出现的问题，经济总的是在向良性循环的方向发展；又要重视眼前遇到的困难，真正下决心进一步搞好治理整顿。江泽民同志讲，治理整顿为深化改革和保证改革健康发展创造条件，对治理整顿不积极也就是对改革不积极。这是完全正确的。现在部分产品的“买方市场”，给工厂带来了不少困难，特别是给乡镇企业带来了困难。但是，也为我们提高企业素质提供了一个机会。如果是“卖方市场”，企业增加花色品种，提高产品质量，降低生产成本，就缺乏动力，反正不管什么东西市场上都销得掉，有的还是抢手货。现在是企业进行改造的好时机，要在技术革新、加强管理、增加花色品种、提高产品质量、节约能源原材料、降低成本、加强配套、改进服务、加快引进设备的国产化等方面下功夫，切实从过去只重视速度和规模，从涨价中增加收入，转到真正提高企业经济效益上来。各地也应该通过提高经济效益来增加财政收入。
    对于这一问题，各省市的领导同志一定要引起足够的重视。要真正发动群众，给厂矿企业创造必要的条件，进行正确的引导，使企业利用现有条件和时机，更健康地向前发展。要看到，通过十年的改革开放，我们引进了一大批先进技术和设备，其中有相当一部分还没有结合中国的情况进行推广和发挥效益。这些年来，我们也锻炼和造就了一大批工程技术人员和企业管理者，他们的眼界比以前开阔了，经营管理能力提高了。这些都说明，企业中蕴藏的潜力是很大的。
    第二个问题，我想再重申一下，我们改革开放的方针和一系列政策不变，保持政策的稳定性和连续性。改革开放的大方向是正确的，一定要坚持，有些改革的具体政策要逐步完善和深化。比如企业承包制，它有着积极作用，如在调动企业和职工积极性和主动性方面，在保证财政收入方面，特别是在当前克服困难方面，都有积极作用。但它确实存在一些不够完善的地方，需要逐步完善，主要是怎样正确处理国家、企业和个人三者之间的关系，怎样解决分配不公的问题。承包条件大都是一对一谈判的，上交税利不是一个行业一个标准，这种情况不可避免地会带来一些不合理的因素；另外，有些企业的客观条件不一样，有些产品的价格和市场状况，不决定于自己。因此，企业利润的多少，效益的高低，有时不完全是由企业经营的好坏决定的。如果承包中不考虑这些，就会使有些企业感到不合理，不公平。在目前条件下，做到完全公平合理也不可能，但应该做到比较公平。承包制还得有发展，承包的形式要保留，但承包的条件要逐步地加以完善。例如，随着生产的增长，企业自有流动资金同步增长，应该作为承包的一个条件。还应考虑固定资产增长、减少短期行为，等等。同样，厂长负责制和企业党委加强政治思想工作的问题，都是一要坚持，二要完善，厂长对生产和经营的指挥权一定不能削弱。
    现在一个比较大的问题是乡镇企业如何发展。乡镇企业过高的生产速度要控制。今年第一季度乡镇企业产值增长的速度仍超过20％，现在已经降到10％以下。强调发挥国营大中型企业的作用，决不是要限制乡镇企业的发展。在社会主义初级阶段，我们允许私营经济存在和发展，何况乡镇企业中相当大一部分是集体企业。它们对安排农村剩余劳力，改善农村经济结构，实行以工补农，增加对农业的投入，促进农业现代化，增加农民收入，为国家和地方提供财政收入，有重大作用。乡镇企业的功绩，是要肯定的。我们不同意赵紫阳同志不恰当地夸大乡镇企业的作用，想把乡镇企业一些不健康的因素引进国营大中型企业的做法，但并不否定乡镇企业的重要作用。乡镇企业的一个主要问题是，如何利用农村本地的原料和材料。乡镇企业的市场，除部分在城市外，主要应该在农村，向农村提供农业生产和农民生活所需要的商品。有的乡镇企业可以形成规模经济，在某一种产品上形成规模效益。但大多数乡镇企业现在是靠比较优惠的条件，比较廉价的劳动力来支持的。鲁冠球的“万向节”厂之所以能站住脚，就是因为它形成了批量生产。有了批量就可以竞争。很多乡镇企业还做不到这一点。因此，在当前产品滞销的情况下，如何巩固、提高、改造，是摆在乡镇企业面前的大问题。总之，对乡镇企业，我们既要肯定它的作用，又必须使之适应新的形势，努力提高技术水平和管理水平，改善产品结构，提高产品质量，使之继续得到适当的发展。
    对个体户和私营企业，也要有正确的政策。个体和私营经济是对社会主义经济的必要补充。农民有些产品，要通过小商小贩的渠道来进行流通。我们对他们的政策是，合法经营要予以保护，非法的予以取缔，要严格照章纳税。现在个体户最严重的违法行为就是偷税漏税，面很大，有的地方达到70％至80％。总之，对个体经济和私营经济，既要发挥它们的积极作用，又要限制其消极因素。对搞批发的要适当限制，不允许靠倒运、靠长途贩运发大财。这不仅会造成社会分配不公，而且对社会有破坏作用。但不要讲过头，好像现在不允许个体经济和私营经济存在。
    还有财政包干、外贸包干、行业包干等，目前都按现行政策继续执行，不会轻易改变，要改变也会事先跟地方商量。这实际是一个利益关系的调整问题。中央、地方、企业、个人几方面的关系要处理好，总的是为了促进生产发展。
    最后再讲一个问题，就是要真正过几年紧日子。现在已出台的一系列廉政措施，要坚定不移地执行，绝不能手软，半途而废。我们的廉政措施实施以来，社会集团购买力有所压缩，吃喝风有所抑制，社会风气也有所好转。企业的吃喝风是不是刹住了？这次中央发的关于请客送礼的文件里面，没有对企业作具体规定。但是其中有一句话，要求企业，包括国营和集体企业参照执行。各级政府应对企业的吃喝风加以引导。说不吃喝就办不了事，这不是社会主义原则，这是一种庸俗作风。非吃吃喝喝才能办事，不吃也能办事，不是更好吗？
    还有一件事，就是企业最头痛的摊派问题。地方政府和各部门四面八方都把手伸向企业。是不是也作为廉政建设的一个内容抓一下。一些城市马路修得那么宽，高楼大厦盖了那么多，钱从哪儿来的？我们调查过，地方财政没有多少钱，大部分是摊派来的。我们要过几年紧日子，各级政府要下决心在这几年中不要再搞这些东西。正在搞的把它维护好，以后再逐步发展。谁不高兴多盖几幢大楼，多修几个体育场，马路修得宽一些？但有些搞得早了一点。在治理整顿时期要停一停。城市改造也要停一停，或者放慢一点速度，不然企业承受不了。企业困难得很，它要承受市场的压力，又要承受职工工资、奖金的压力。所以要下决心，一是要求企业自己少吃少喝，真正搞增产节约，艰苦奋斗；二是要采取严厉措施，制止对企业的摊派。这样，才能给企业创造一个比较好的条件，使企业度过难关。同时，企业自身也要把现有的资金很好地用到技术改造上去，增加花色品种，提高产品质量。经过3年治理整顿，企业就会改变面貌。经济实力的增长，不仅表现在产品数量上，而且主要应该表现在产品质量上。
    总之，各级领导干部既要看到当前经济形势的严峻，又必须树立信心，鼓足勇气，克服困难，利用工业生产速度下降、市场疲软这个机会，提高企业素质。经过治理整顿、深化改革，使经济实现持续、稳定、协调发展，是大有希望的。　（载《求是》杂志第21期）
