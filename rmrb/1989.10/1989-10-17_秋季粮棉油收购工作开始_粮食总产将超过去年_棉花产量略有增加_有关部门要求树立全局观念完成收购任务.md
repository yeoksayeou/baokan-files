The autumn grain, cotton, and oil procurement work has begun. The total grain production will exceed last year's, and cotton production has slightly increased. Relevant departments require establishing a comprehensive perspective to complete the procurement tasks.

	BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- The autumn grain and oil crops have started to be harvested, and cotton procurement has begun from south to north.

	From tonight's national grain, cotton, and oil procurement work telephone conference, reporters learned that this year's grain crops have increased in the south and decreased in the north, with the increase outweighing the decrease, resulting in a total production that will exceed last year's. Oilseed crops have increased in the summer and decreased in the autumn, with the overall production remaining roughly the same. Cotton production has slightly increased, while vegetables, fruits, silkworm cocoons, tobacco leaves, and hemp have all seen increases in production.

	Minister of Commerce Hu Ping said that the procurement situation for grain, cotton, and oil this year is good. Whether in bountiful harvest areas or in semi-disaster and light-disaster areas, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive perspective to ensure the completion or over-fulfillment of the grain and oil procurement tasks. For grain, not only should the state contract procurement tasks be completed, but also the commercial department's forthcoming purchase plan should be fulfilled. This is a basic requirement for stabilizing the economy and ensuring market supply.

	Hu Ping pointed out that the current grain and oil market order is chaotic, with excessive wholesale activities. Before the autumn grain and oil multi-channel procurement begins, each locality should conduct a thorough cleanup of all types of companies engaged in grain and oil trading, with a focus on rectifying wholesale activities. Private enterprises and individual business owners are strictly prohibited from engaging in grain and oil wholesale business. However, market trade should continue to be open, allowing for small-scale grain adjustments between surplus and deficit areas. Cotton will be procured and managed uniformly by the supply and marketing cooperatives, without a dual-track pricing system. Cotton free trade markets will be closed, and the State Council will dispatch cotton procurement inspection teams for supervision and inspection.

	Hu Ping required that all levels of grain and oil departments and the supply and marketing cooperatives' cadres and staff do a good job in procurement services. They must ensure the fulfillment of all linked materials, reduce the time farmers spend queuing to sell their agricultural products, and provide resting places for farmers. Vice Governor of the People's Bank of China, Qiu Qing, stated that to ensure the completion of procurement tasks, in addition to organizing and concentrating funds from all aspects of agricultural and sideline product procurement, the People's Bank of China has specially arranged more than 200 billion yuan in seasonal short-term loans.

	Vice Secretary of the State Council Bai Meiqing presided over tonight's telephone conference and, on behalf of the State Council, expressed greetings and thanks to the grassroots cadres in rural areas who have been working tirelessly and diligently on the front lines for a long time, as well as to the broad masses of workers in state-owned and collective procurement departments.

    秋季粮棉油收购工作开始
    粮食总产将超过去年　棉花产量略有增加
    有关部门要求树立全局观念完成收购任务
    本报北京10月16日讯　记者刘霄报道：今年秋季粮油作物已经陆续登场，棉花收购从南到北普遍开秤。
    记者从今晚召开的全国粮棉油收购工作电话会议获悉，今年粮食作物南增北减，增大于减，总产将超过去年；油料作物夏增秋减，大体相当；棉花产量略有增产；蔬菜、水果、蚕茧、烟叶、黄红麻也都是增产的。
    商业部长胡平说，今年粮棉油的收购形势是好的。无论是丰收地区，还是半产、轻灾地区，都要树立全局观念，保证完成或超额完成粮油定购任务。就粮食来讲，不仅要完成国家合同定购任务，而且要完成商业部即将下达的议购计划，这是稳定经济、保障市场供应的基本需要。
    胡平指出，目前粮油市场秩序比较乱，批发过多过滥，各地要在秋季粮油开始多渠道收购前，对经营粮油的各类公司普遍进行一次清理，重点是整顿批发。严禁私营企业和个体户经营粮油批发业务。但集市贸易要继续开放，允许进行少量粮食的余缺调剂。棉花由供销社统一收购，统一经营，不搞价格双轨制，关闭棉花自由交易市场，国务院将派出棉花收购巡视组进行监督检查。
    胡平要求各级粮油部门和供销社的广大干部职工做好收购服务工作，要确保各项挂钩物资的兑现，减少农民交售农产品排队的时间，并为农民准备休息的地方。人民银行副行长邱晴表示，为了保证收购任务的完成，除组织和集中了各方面农副产品收购资金外，人民银行还专门安排了200多亿元的季节性短期贷款。
    国务院副秘书长白美清主持了今晚的电话会议，并代表国务院向任劳任怨、埋头苦干、长期工作在第一线的农村基层干部和国营、集体收购部门的广大职工表示慰问和感谢。
