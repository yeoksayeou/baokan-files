Yiliang Strengthens the Party Member Contact Household System: Party Members Lead Farmers on the Path to Prosperity

    YUNNAN, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Known as the "Grain Basket of Central Yunnan," Yiliang County in Yunnan Province has been implementing the party member contact household system for six years. This system has become an effective way for grassroots party organizations and party members to play a leading role in the new situation, promoting rural reform and driving production development.

    The party member contact household system in Yiliang was established in 1983 and gradually promoted. Its main contents are "three lead, six proactive, and one corresponding," which means leading in studying the party's line, principles, and policies, leading in poverty alleviation and assistance, leading in labor for wealth, proactively providing production information, proactively helping to solve practical problems in production, proactively listening to and reflecting the opinions and demands of the masses, proactively helping to mediate civil disputes, proactively conducting legal education for the contact households, and proactively learning production and operation techniques from specialized households and key households. "One corresponding" refers to the direct contact between county-level government agencies and enterprises with mountain and semi-mountain townships.

    The party member contact household system has played a good role. Old party member Li Baoshu, after becoming rich by raising ducks, selflessly passed on his techniques to the three farm households he was in contact with. His contact, Yao Guanghui, earned a pure income of 500 yuan in less than half a year with his help and began to shake off poverty. Over the years, Li Baoshu has provided more than 1,700 ducks to his contact households at a discount. Party branch secretary Yang Decai helped the poor household Yang Decong to lease a processing plant. Yang Decong, after getting rid of poverty, became a specialized household and added an agricultural machinery repair project, providing free services worth 300 to 400 yuan each year for other poor households. In 1986, after he joined the party, he proactively contacted poor households. The party member contact household system is becoming more and more influential. Now, out of the 8,045 rural party members in the county, 5,527 party members are in contact with 5,238 farm households, including 2,348 poor households.

    After the farmers in Yiliang generally got rid of poverty, in response to the new situation, the Yiliang County Committee started requiring all contact party members in the county to shift the focus of their contacts from poverty alleviation and assistance to the development of family operations in 1987, leading farmers on the path to common prosperity. The county committee took various measures to make the contact households an important force in rural economic development.

    The development and improvement of the party member contact household system activities have had a positive significance for rural party members to play a leading role, promoting the improvement of party style and village customs, strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses, and ensuring the implementation of the party's various rural policies.

　　宜良巩固党员联系户制度
　　党员带领农民同走富裕路
    本报昆明电　记者钱江报道：有“滇中粮仓”之称的云南省宜良县，坚持党员联系户制度6年，这已成为农村基层党组织和党员在新形势下发挥先锋模范作用的好形式，促进了农村的深化改革，也推动了生产的发展。
    宜良的党员联系户制度是1983年建立并逐步推广的。主要内容是“三带头、六主动和一个对口”，即带头学习党的路线、方针和政策，带头扶贫助难，带头劳动致富，主动提供生产信息；主动帮助解决生产中的实际问题，主动听取和反映群众的意见和要求，主动帮助调解民事纠纷，主动向联户对象进行遵纪守法教育，主动向专业户、重点户学习生产和经营技术。“一个对口”是指县直机关和企事业单位对口联系山区半山区办事处。
    党员联系户发挥了好作用。老党员李保树养鸭致富后，毫无保留地将技术传授给联系的三家农户，联系对象姚光辉在他帮助下不到半年纯收入500元，开始摆脱贫困。几年来李保树向联系户提供的优惠种鸭达1700多只。党支部书记杨德成帮助困难户杨德聪承包加工厂，杨德聪脱贫成了专业户又增加了农机修理项目，每年为别的困难户提供无偿服务三四百元。1986年他入党后主动联系困难户。党员联户制度越来越有声势。现在，全县8045名农村党员中有5527名党员联系着5238户农民，其中贫困户有2348个。
    在宜良农民普遍脱贫后，针对新的形势，宜良县委从1987年开始，要求全县联户党员把联系的重点从过去的扶贫助难转到发展家庭经营上来，带领农民走共同富裕的路。县委采取各种措施，使联户成为农村经济发展的重要力量。
    党员联户制度活动的发展和完善，对农村党员发挥先锋模范作用有着积极意义，促进了党风、村风的好转，密切了党群关系，也使党的各项农村政策得到较好贯彻。
