The extensive promotion of the creation of "double model counties" for ethnic unity and military-civilian solidarity has led Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region into a new era of stable social order, thriving economic development, and fortified borders.

The troops stationed in Xinjiang have actively supported the region's economic construction. Within their garrisons and units, they persistently propagate Marxist views on ethnicity, dedicating themselves to the unity of border peoples and military-civilian solidarity.

The various levels of people's governments in Xinjiang have prioritized enhancing national defense awareness and providing robust support to the troops stationed in the region as key components and evaluation criteria for creating "double model counties." This has fostered a societal atmosphere where everyone cares for and supports the construction of the military, and where both military and civilians jointly build and defend the borders. Many counties and cities in the garrison areas have supported the troops in implementing the "vegetable basket project." For the employment of military families and the enrollment of children in kindergartens and schools, local governments have exerted their utmost efforts to resolve these practical difficulties. Some counties and cities with better conditions have supported the troops in building power stations, ground satellite receiving stations, and food processing factories, assisting the troops in cultivating dual-purpose talents. This has inspired the broad masses of soldiers to dedicate themselves to national defense and border security, ensuring the stability of the troops and the completion of various tasks.

Since the launch of this activity in 1982, 10 counties and cities have been named as model counties and cities for ethnic unity and military-civilian solidarity. A total of 323 advanced collectives and 593 advanced individuals have been commended.
