The Bulgarian people are a humble, friendly, and polite nation. I worked in Bulgaria for several years and deeply felt that there is an atmosphere of mutual understanding and willingness to help others among the people. I also felt the healthy psychology of people working hard, striving forward, and being full of hope for the future. All of this makes the social life and interpersonal relationships there quite harmonious, filled with friendship and warmth.

When riding public buses or trams, people board and alight in an orderly manner, with no pushing or jostling for seats. If the driver sees someone running to catch the bus, they will patiently wait and say, "I'll wait for you, no rush." Passengers will genuinely respond with "Thank you," and the driver and passengers' emotions blend together. When asking for directions on the street, those asked will always enthusiastically point the way, and if they are not familiar, they will help you ask someone else. In public places, when opening or closing doors, people always check if there is someone in front or behind, never slamming the door shut without regard for others. No matter what profession people are in, whether they are salespeople, service staff, drivers, or cleaners, they always talk about their work with enthusiasm, showing a sense of pride.

In the 45 years since Bulgaria's establishment, while achieving great success in economic construction, it has also placed special emphasis on the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. As early as the 1960s and 1970s, the Bulgarian Communist Party proposed building Bulgaria into a nation with "high cultural and technical standards." In 1986, the 13th Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party proposed the goal of building Bulgaria into a "highly developed and civilized socialist country" by the end of the century.

The Bulgarian Party and government have always attached great importance to ideological and political work, believing that "if the national economy is in chaos, it can still be adjusted, but if the people's thoughts are in chaos, it will be much harder to adjust." Based on this understanding, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government have always considered conducting timely ideological and political work for citizens as a major task for the entire party and nation, requiring citizens to have "high communist ideals and loyalty to the socialist cause." They have also taken practical measures to cultivate the people's communist ideals and resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology.

To strengthen moral education, the Party and government pay great attention to using books, films, radio, and television, as well as organizing various cultural and entertainment activities in streets and parks, to encourage the people to promote collectivism and mutual assistance. At the same time, they sharply criticize phenomena such as opportunism, embezzlement, bribery, and using power for personal gain that arise in social life, promote righteousness, eliminate evil, and further stabilize society. This is an important reason why Bulgaria has good social order and a low crime rate.

Patriotism and revolutionary tradition education are important components of Bulgaria's spiritual civilization construction. The Bulgarian government has always valued using its own history to conduct education on national excellent traditions, widely using museums, revolutionary sites, and the homes, statues, and memorials of revolutionary martyrs for regular educational activities. For example, organizing youth to visit and guard memorials during holidays, and holding team activities; young men and women presenting flowers when getting married, and primary and secondary school students receiving free political, historical, and professional courses in relevant museums and memorial halls. These activities have a positive effect on enhancing the national pride, self-confidence, and sense of honor of the Bulgarian people, especially the youth.

    保加利亚的精神文明建设
    卫兴龙
    保加利亚民族是一个谦和友善、热情礼貌的民族。我在保加利亚工作了几年，深切感受到在那里人与人之间有一种相互谅解、乐于为别人提供帮助的气氛，感受到人们诚实劳动、奋发向上、对未来充满希望的健康心理。这一切，使得那里的社会生活和人际关系相当和谐，充满友谊与温馨。
    乘坐公共电、汽车，人们顺序上下车，没有拥挤和抢座位的现象。司机发现有人跑来赶车，必定会耐心地等候，还会说上一句：“等您，别着急”。乘客上车后，由衷地回一声“多谢您”，司机与乘客情感交融。行人街头问路，被问者总会热情地指路，如自己不熟，也会帮你向别人打听。在公共场合，开关门时总要看看前后是否有人，从不猛推猛摔，旁若无人。人们不论从事什么职业，售货员、服务员也好，司机、清洁工也好，谈起自己的工作总是津津乐道，流露着一种自豪的神情。
    保加利亚建国四十五年来，在经济建设取得巨大成就的同时，还特别重视社会主义精神文明的建设。早在六七十年代，保共就提出了把保加利亚建设成为一个“有高度教养的有技术的民族”，一九八六年保共十三大又提出，到本世纪末把保加利亚建设成为“高度发达的文明的社会主义国家”的目标。
    保加利亚党和政府一贯重视思想政治工作，认为“国家经济搞乱了，尚可调整，群众的思想搞乱了，调整起来就难得多了。”基于这一认识，保共与政府一贯把对公民进行适时的思想政治工作当作全党全国的重大任务，要求公民具有“高度共产主义思想和忠于社会主义事业”，并采取切实措施，培养人民的共产主义思想，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。
    为了加强道德教育，党和政府十分注意运用书刊、电影、广播和电视等手段，以及在街头、公园等开展种种文化娱乐活动等，鼓励人民弘扬集体主义精神和互助的风气。与此同时，对社会生活中滋生的投机钻营、损公肥私、贪污受贿、以权谋私等腐败现象进行尖锐的抨击，发扬正气，消除邪恶，进一步促使社会稳定。这是保加利亚社会治安良好、犯罪率低的一个重要原因。
    爱国主义和革命传统教育是保加利亚精神文明建设的重要组成部分。保加利亚政府历来重视利用本国历史，进行民族优良传统教育，广泛运用博物馆、革命圣地以及革命先烈的故居、塑像、纪念碑等进行经常性的教育活动，如节假日组织青少年拜谒、在纪念碑值勤守灵和举行团队活动；青年男女结婚时献花、中小学生免费在相应的博物馆、纪念馆里上政治课、历史课和专业课等。这些活动对提高保加利亚人民特别是青少年的民族自尊心、自信心和自豪感产生积极的作用。
