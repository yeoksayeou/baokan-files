Ecological economics is a new interdisciplinary field that integrates ecology and economics, a science of significant importance to economic development and human destiny. Although this science originated in developed countries, since the early 1980s, under the advocacy of the late renowned economist Xu Tixian, it has flourished in China. Extensive practice has proven that the study of economic and social development cannot be separated from the study of ecological environmental issues, as humans utilize and alter the ecological environment in production and are affected by the natural ecological environment, whether positively or negatively. Similarly, the study of urban and rural ecological environmental issues cannot be separated from economic research, as most contemporary urban and rural ecological environmental problems are caused by economic factors. To fundamentally solve these problems, corresponding levels of social and economic development, social economic systems, and economic investments are required. Therefore, the development of urban and rural economies and ecological environments needs to be studied comprehensively.

Since the establishment of the Chinese Ecological Economics Society in 1984, under the organization and guidance of the society, China's research in ecological economics has made significant progress. Several monographs on "Ecological Economics" and "Agricultural Ecological Economics" have been published, promoting the research and teaching of ecological economics nationwide. The publication of Ma Chuandong's new book "Urban Ecological Economics" (published by Economic Daily Press) is a new achievement in the field of ecological economics research in China. It reflects that the research in ecological economics in China is developing in depth and breadth.

Urban ecological economics is an important subfield of ecological economics. This is because ecological economics is a discipline that studies the mutual relationship between economic and social development and ecological environmental development. Humans, for survival and development, must engage in labor to exchange materials between themselves and nature. In labor, humans cannot be separated from the ecological environment around them; without the ecological environment, including light, heat, air, water, organisms, minerals, and various organic and inorganic substances, humans cannot manufacture tools, obtain labor objects, or even meet basic survival conditions. However, humans must exchange materials and energy with the natural ecosystem through labor, inevitably leading to a contradictory yet unified relationship between the ecological system and the economic system in the process of taking materials and energy from the natural ecosystem and returning various waste materials and energy to the natural ecosystem. Thus, ecological economics becomes a science that studies the laws of the ecological-economic system formed by the combination of the ecological system and the economic system. It should be noted that in the contemporary era of rapid urbanization, cities have become the primary spatial regions for humans to exchange materials with nature, and the development of cities has expanded human production domains from the land surface to the entire Earth's surface. Therefore, various ecological and economic contradictions and problems in cities are particularly complex. This determines that in the development of ecological economics, a subfield dedicated to studying the contradictory yet unified laws of urban ecological systems and urban economic systems must emerge. This subfield is urban ecological economics.

Cities are the products of the development of social productive forces and commodity economies. In cities, social material wealth, human intelligence, and ancient and modern civilizations are concentrated; at the same time, various contemporary human contradictions are also concentrated. In the process of material exchange with nature, urban residents, while obtaining various use values needed by humans, also bring many adverse side effects and factors harmful to human health and material production to cities. For example, urban air pollution, water pollution, garbage pollution, land subsidence, noise pollution; many cities have backward infrastructure, water shortages, energy shortages; some cities have population explosions, traffic congestion, housing shortages, and land shortages; some cities have scenic and tourist resources polluted, and the characteristics of famous cities destroyed, etc. Therefore, how to achieve the coordination and unity of urban economic and social development with ecological environmental construction has become a major theoretical and practical issue facing contemporary domestic and international cities. Urban ecological economics aims to explore the laws of coordinated development and benign circulation of urban ecological economics through in-depth research on the urban ecological-economic complex system. The author, in this book, grasps this fundamental idea, first discussing in the "General Theory" section the characteristics, structure, functions, benefits, and basic principles that need to be followed to achieve coordinated development of urban ecological economics; then, further, in the second part, studying comprehensive ecological economic issues such as urban industrial ecological economics, urban circulation ecological economics, urban consumption ecological economics, urban environmental protection and rational use of resources, and urban infrastructure construction; in the third part, studying regional ecological economic issues such as urban group ecological economics, small town ecological economics, suburban ecological economics, and urban scenic and tourist area ecological economics; in the fourth part, exploring and studying urban ecological economic development strategies, urban ecological economic planning, urban ecological economic management, and ecological economic theories in urban economic system reforms. Although some of the author's views in the book still need further consideration, and some chapters still need further maturation, this book reflects the author's systematic thinking on urban ecological economic issues and provides systematic knowledge in this area. Its publication will attract more people to pay attention to urban ecological economic issues and will be beneficial to the in-depth development of urban ecological economic research in China.

    重视城市生态经济问题的综合研究
    ——《城市生态经济学》序言
    刘国光
    生态经济学是一门生态学和经济学有机结合的新兴边缘学科，是一门对经济发展和人类命运有着重要意义的科学。这门科学虽然最早产生于发达国家，但从80年代初开始，经已故著名经济学家许涤新的倡导，已在我国蓬勃兴起。大量实践证明，经济社会发展的研究离不开生态环境问题的研究，因为人在生产中要利用生态环境，改变生态环境，并接受自然生态环境对生产有利或不利的影响。同样，对城乡生态环境问题的研究也离不开经济研究，因为当代城乡生态环境问题的产生大都是由经济的原因造成的；而要根本解决这些问题，又需要有相应的社会经济发达程度、社会经济制度和经济投资等条件。所以，对城乡经济发展和城乡生态环境发展需要综合研究。
    1984年成立中国生态经济学会后，在学会的组织和引导下，我国的生态经济学研究已取得很大进展，已陆续出版了几部《生态经济学》、《农业生态经济学》等方面的专著，推动了全国生态经济学的研究和教学等工作。马传栋的新作《城市生态经济学》（经济日报出版社出版）一书的出版，是我国生态经济学研究方面的一项新成果。它反映了我国生态经济学的研究正向着深度和广度发展。
    城市生态经济学是生态经济学的重要分支学科。这是因为，生态经济学是研究经济社会发展同生态环境发展之间的相互关系的学科。人类为了生存和发展，必须从事劳动来进行人和自然之间的物质变换。人类在劳动中，是不能同自然界即他们周围的生态环境脱离关系的；离开了生态环境，离开了自然环境中的光、热、空气、水、生物、矿物等各种有机物质和无机物质，人类就不能制造工具，就不能得到劳动对象，甚至连生存条件都没有。而人类要通过劳动同自然生态系统发生物质变换，必然要在从自然生态系统中取走物质和能量、并返还自然生态系统各种废弃物质和能量的过程中，产生生态系统与经济系统之间的对立统一关系。这样，生态经济学就成为研究这种生态系统和经济系统结合而成的生态经济系统的规律性的科学。应当看到，在城市化日益发展的当代，城市已成为人类同自然之间进行物质变换的主要地域空间，而且城市的发展已使人类的生产领域从地球表面的土地扩展到整个地球表层。因此，城市中各种生态与经济的矛盾和问题十分复杂。这就决定了，在生态经济学的发展中，必然要产生专门研究城市生态系统和城市经济系统的对立统一规律的分支学科。这个分支学科就是城市生态经济学。
    城市是社会生产力和商品经济发展的产物。在城市中集中了社会物质财富、人类智慧和古今文明；同时也集中了当代人类的各种矛盾。城市的人们在同自然进行物质变换的过程中，在取得人类所需要的各种使用价值的同时，也给城市带来了很多不利于人类的副作用和有害于人民健康及物质生产的因素。诸如城市的大气污染、水污染、垃圾污染、地面降沉、噪音污染；很多城市的基础设施落后、水资源短缺、能源紧张；一些城市的人口膨胀、交通拥挤、住宅短缺、土地紧张；一些城市的风景旅游资源被污染、名城特色被破坏，等等。所以，如何实现城市经济社会发展与生态环境建设的协调和统一，就成为当代国内外城市所面临的重大理论问题和实际问题。城市生态经济学就是要通过对城市生态——经济复合系统的深入研究，去探讨城市生态经济协调发展和良性循环的规律性。作者在本书中抓住了这一基本思路，在书的“总论”部分中首先论述了城市生态经济系统的特点、结构、功能、效益和实现城市生态经济协调发展所需遵循的基本原则等理论问题；然后又深入一步，在第二编中研究了城市工业生态经济、城市流通生态经济、城市消费生态经济、城市环境保护与资源合理利用、城市基础设施建设等综合性生态经济问题；在第三编中研究了城市群生态经济、小城镇生态经济、市郊生态经济和城市风景旅游区生态经济等区域性生态经济问题；在第四编中探讨和研究了城市生态经济发展战略、城市生态经济规划、城市生态经济管理以及城市经济体制改革中的生态经济理论等问题。尽管作者在书中的某些观点还需要进一步斟酌，某些章节的论述还需要进一步成熟，但这本书体现了作者对城市生态经济问题的系统思考，提供了这方面的系统知识。它的出版将吸引更多的人们关心城市生态经济问题，并有利于我国城市生态经济学研究的深入发展。
