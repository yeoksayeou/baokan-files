The Tokyo District Court ruled on October 3 that the Ministry of Education's approval of history textbooks from 1980 to 1983, which included edits on topics such as "Japan's aggression" and the "Nanking Massacre," was not illegal. This decision has been met with criticism and condemnation from local figures.

The so-called "textbook lawsuit" refers to a series of legal actions initiated by Professor Ienaga Saburo, formerly of Tokyo University of Education, against the government over the approval of his history textbooks. This is the third such lawsuit. In January 1984, Professor Ienaga filed the third lawsuit, arguing that the Ministry of Education's approval process for his high school history textbook, "Shin Nihon Rekishi" (New Japanese History), from 1980 to 1983, violated the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and academic freedom. During the trial, 31 historians and writers testified.

According to reports, the dispute in this lawsuit involved several specific historical accounts related to Japan's invasion of China. For example, the Ministry of Education's approval process at the time argued that the Nanking Massacre "cannot be confirmed as having been organized by the Japanese military," and regarding the Unit 731 bacteriological warfare unit, the Ministry stated that "the academic community is still in the process of gathering materials, and it is too early to mention it now," ordering changes or deletions. In this ruling, while the court acknowledged that Professor Ienaga's accounts of the Nanking Massacre and other events had "considerable grounds" and that there was "room for criticism" regarding the appropriateness of the approval process, it also stated that the Ministry's approval and revision opinions "cannot be said to be obviously inappropriate from a general social perspective," and thus "do not constitute a violation of the law," rejecting Ienaga's claims. Ienaga expressed his intention to appeal the decision.

Some Japanese individuals believe that although the October 3 ruling in the third textbook lawsuit pertains to events before the 1982 textbook incident, and the Ministry of Education is currently conducting approvals based on new standards, the ruling effectively endorses past approval processes. This indicates that some people are still unwilling to acknowledge or intentionally whitewash Japan's history of external aggression. Famous writer Morimura Seiichi, who testified regarding the Unit 731 bacteriological warfare unit, stated, "Not including reflections on the war and Japan's mistakes in the war in textbooks is extremely shameful to the international community." Professor Fujihara Akira of modern Japanese history expressed that Japan's invasion of China and the Nanking Massacre are historical facts, and the Ministry of Education has no right to decide history.

### 有意粉饰日本对外侵略历史  东京法院竟判决文部省对教科书审定合法

    有意粉饰日本对外侵略历史
    东京法院竟判决文部省对教科书审定合法
    本报讯　东京地方法院于10月3日对第三次教科书诉讼案作出判决，宣布文部省在对1980年至1983年度的历史教科书的审定中，对有关“日本的侵略”、“南京大屠杀”等的记述提出的审定意见“不能算违法”。这一判决遭到当地有关人士的批评和谴责。
    所谓“教科书诉讼案”是指原东京教育大学教授家永三郎就他写的历史教科书问题以政府为被告提出的诉讼，这种诉讼迄今已提出3次。1984年1月，家永教授第三次提出，文部省在1980年至1983年度的教科书审定中，对他为高中生撰写的历史教科书《新日本史》中有关“侵略”的用语和对“南京大屠杀”、“七三一部队”的记述提出的审定修改意见，“违反了宪法保障的表现自由和学问自由”。在审理过程中，曾有31位历史学家和作家出庭作证。这就是第三次教科书诉讼案。
    据报道，在这一诉讼案中对有关具体记述的争论，有多处是与日本侵华战争有关。如当时文部省提出的审定意见中，认为对南京大屠杀“不能断定是日军有组织地挑起的”，对有关七三一细菌部队问题，文部省认为“学术界处于搜集史料阶段，现在提及为时尚早”，命令修改或删除。在这次判决中，法院虽然认为家永教授对南京大屠杀等的记述“有相当的理由”、对审定意见的妥当性“有批判的余地”，但又说文部省的审定修改意见“从社会一般看法来说，不能说是明显欠妥”，因而“不算违法”，驳回了家永的主张。家永表示不服判决，决定上诉。
    有些日本人士认为，虽然10月3日判决的第三次教科书诉讼案内容是指1982年教科书事件以前的事，文部省目前按照新标准进行审定，但判决结果显系对过去审定意见的追认，表明在某些人的心理上仍不愿承认或有意掩饰美化日本对外侵略的历史。曾就日军七三一细菌部队问题出庭作证的著名作家森村诚一说，“在教科书中不刊登对战争的反省和日本在战争中所犯的错误，对国际社会来说是非常耻辱的。”日本近代史教授藤原彰表示，日本侵略中国、南京大屠杀等都是历史事实，文部省没有权力决定历史。
