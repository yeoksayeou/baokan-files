Title: Newly Discovered Letter from Lu Xun to Jiang Shao Yuan (1)

Edition: 8

Mr. Jiang Shao Yuan:

It has been ten days since we parted, truly as they say, "The days and months fly by like arrows, and time passes like lightning." The lecture notes you sent me arrived four days ago, probably having lain in the post office for several days.

In the past few days, many people at Sun Yat-sen University have been quite anxious. This is because Liu Xian had telegraphed to stop the appointment of the geologist, asking him to delay his arrival. I thought these were people from the Geological Survey, and since the Ministry of Civil Affairs is about to be replaced, stopping them is not surprising. However, they seem to still be anxious, feeling that there is an unseen enemy attacking, not only is the Ministry of Education unstable, but even the vice president is in danger. In the future, they will face the Nth round of purges. Fu’s trip to Hong Kong is to seek He’s advice on strategies. As for He’s position as editor of a certain newspaper, it has indeed become a thing of the past. However, it is heard that the school affairs are fortunate to have Li’s support. It is said that this support can last until the end of the year. I do not know if this is true?

In the past couple of days, things have been a bit calmer. Occasionally, there are posters saying "Support the President and Vice President," but they are immediately torn down.

Professor Gu Shu Professor wrote to a certain gentleman here, saying (in essence), "Because Lu Xun has not left Guangzhou, he may not go, and Mr. Cai has kept me in Nanjing to work." I only said that I would not be in the same school with him; he exaggerated it to mean not being in the same province. Amazing! However, this contains news about Sun Yat-sen University. Ji Mi’s prophecy is gradually coming true.

I have agreed to give a few lectures at the "Academic Lecture Series" organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, so I will have to leave in August. This is not for any deep reason; it is just to make a small splash and make a few people unhappy. If someone is unhappy, I am happy. My conscience has become so bad lately.

I wonder when Marshal Feng can enter Beijing. If he can take the fast train from Tianjin to Beijing Station in August, it would be wonderful!

Yours,
Lu Xun
July 12

Please inform Jiang when you see him about recent events. But he does not know the details, so it may not be very interesting.

Notes:
(1) Jiang Shao Yuan: Also known as Shao Ping (1898–1983), from Jingde, Anhui. A scholar of religion and folklore. He studied in the United States twice. After returning to China, he taught at Peking University and was one of the founders and main contributors to the journal *Language Threads*. In the spring of 1927, he was recommended by Lu Xun to teach at the English Language and Literature Department of Sun Yat-sen University and served as acting head of the department. After the April 12 counter-revolutionary coup, Lu Xun resolutely resigned from all his positions at Sun Yat-sen University, and Jiang also resigned in anger and left Guangzhou for Hangzhou in early July, staying at his father-in-law's house to find another job. He received this lost letter from Lu Xun and another lost letter dated August 17, both during this time.

(2) Liu Xian: Zhu Jia Hua (1892–1963), also known as Jia Xian or Jia Xian Xian, from Wu Xing, Zhejiang. He studied in Germany and later taught at Peking University. In 1927, he served as the vice president of Sun Yat-sen University and was in charge of the school's administration.

(3) The Ministry of Civil Affairs is about to be replaced: In 1927, Zhu Jia Hua was appointed as the Minister of Civil Affairs of Guangdong Province, but soon Li Wen Fan took over.

(4) Not only is the Ministry of Education unstable, but even the vice president is in danger: According to contemporary reports, when Zhu Jia Hua was appointed as the Minister of Education of Guangdong Province, he declined the position on the grounds of "concentrating on running Sun Yat-sen University." Therefore, the position was temporarily held by the original minister, Xu Chong Qing. Whether the minister's position would change still awaited the final decision of the National Government. Additionally, there were rumors that there would be personnel changes at the university.

(5) The Nth round of purges: "N" is the unknown number in mathematics; "the Nth round" means the unknown number of rounds. "Purges" refers to the counter-revolutionary actions of the Kuomintang reactionaries to sabotage the first United Front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, purging Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League who had joined the Kuomintang according to the agreement that allowed "cross-party membership." At that time, there were also Kuomintang members who were not cross-party members but were purged due to suspicion, so the Kuomintang was in a state of fear.

(6) Fu’s trip to Hong Kong is to seek He’s advice on strategies: Fu refers to Fu Sinian (1896–1950), also known as Meng Zhen, from Liaocheng, Shandong. He was a key member of the New Tide Society during the May Fourth Movement at Peking University. After graduating from Peking University, he studied in England and Germany and returned to China in 1926 to serve as the head of the Philosophy Department and the director of the Literature and History Division (equivalent to the dean of the College of Liberal Arts in later comprehensive universities) at Sun Yat-sen University. He refers to He Si Yuan (1896–1982), also known as Xian Chao, from Heze, Shandong. After graduating from Peking University, he studied in the United States and Germany and served as the deputy director of the Political Training Department at Sun Yat-sen University at that time.

(7) As for He’s position as editor of a certain newspaper, it has indeed become a thing of the past: The certain newspaper refers to *National News*, a newspaper established by the Kuomintang in Guangzhou in 1925. Initially, it propagated the National Revolution, but after April 12, it was controlled by the Kuomintang reactionaries and became a mouthpiece for counter-revolution. He Si Yuan had served as the editor of this newspaper, but after He left for Nanjing, the position was taken by someone else.

(8) Li: Refers to Li Ji Sheng (1884–1959), also known as Ren Chao, from Cangwu, Guangxi.

(9) Occasionally, there are posters saying "Support the President and Vice President": The "President and Vice President" refer to Dai Jie Tao (1890–1949) and Zhu Jia Hua. "Posters" refer to big-character posters or small-character posters today.

(10) Professor Gu Shu: Refers to Gu Jiegang (1893–1980). After Gu arrived at Sun Yat-sen University in April 1927, Lu Xun, who did not want to work with him, decided to leave Sun Yat-sen University. Fu Sinian wrote a letter to persuade him to stay, saying that he "had a remedy, even if he went to Beijing to buy books, he would not be in the school" (see *Complete Works of Lu Xun* Volume 11, page 543, letter to Zhang Tingqian). Therefore, Lu Xun jokingly refers to Gu as "Professor Book Buyer."

(11) Ji Mi’s prophecy is gradually coming true: Ji Mi is the courtesy name of Xu Shou Chang, also known as Ji Shi. Xu Shou Chang (1882–1948), from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, was an educator. He wrote a letter to Lu Xun saying, "Zhejiang Province also has plans to establish a university, ... I think Fu and Gu will soon come to Zhejiang." Lu Xun used this to verify what Fu said in his letter, making Gu "go to Beijing to buy books, not in the school" and Gu’s own words, "Mr. Cai kept me in Nanjing to work," indicating that Gu had long planned to only be a nominal professor at Sun Yat-sen University and had designs on Zhejiang University (initially named the Third Sun Yat-sen University), such as a research professorship, etc. (see *Complete Works of Lu Xun* Volume 11, page 550, letter to Zhang Tingqian).

(12) I have agreed to give a few lectures at the "Academic Lecture Series" organized by the Municipal Education Bureau: The content of this lecture is the later final draft of the essay *The Spirit of Wei and Jin and the Relationship between Literature, Medicine, and Alcohol*.

(13) Marshal Feng: Refers to Feng Yu Xiang.

　　新发现的鲁迅书信致
　　江绍原（1）信（一）（1927年7月12日）绍原先生：
    一别遂将十日，真所谓“隙驷不留尺波电逝”者欤？寄给我的讲义，前四天已收到，大约颇在邮局里躺了好几天也。
    前几天中大有些人颇惶惶，因为留先（2）曾电阻聘定的地质学者，令其缓来。我以为这些都是地质调查所中人物，今民厅将卸（3），则止之殊不足怪。
    而他们似乎仍惶惶，以为冥冥之中有敌进攻，不特教厅不稳，即校副亦危（4），将来当厄于第N次之清党（5）。傅之赴港，乃觅何（6），商方略也。而何之某报编辑，则确已归于乌有（7）。然闻校事幸尚有李支持（8）。说者谓此支持，可以延至年底。不知确否？
    近一两天平静些了，偶有“拥护正副校长”云云之贴纸出现（9），但即被撕。
　　顾购书教授（10）致此地某君信，内有云（大意），“因鲁迅未离广州，所以或不复去，蔡先生留我在南京做事”。我不过不与同校；他扩大了：不与同省。伟哉！然而此中可参中大消息。季黻之预言，已渐实现了（11）。
    我因已允往市教育局之“学术讲演会”讲几点钟（12），所以须八月间才能走。此举无什么深意，不过小出风头，给几个人不高兴而已。有人不高兴，我即高兴，我近来良心之坏已至如此。
    冯大帅（13）不知何时可以进北京，倘8月间能坐津浦快车而到前门，岂不快哉！
              迅启上
                  七．十二．
    见川岛时，希告以近事。但他不深知细情，恐怕亦无甚么趣味也。
    注释：
      （1）江绍原：又名绍平（1898——1983）安徽旌德人。宗教学和民俗学家。曾先后两次留学美国。回国后任北京大学教授，是《语丝》的发起人和主要撰稿人之一。1927年春经鲁迅推荐，任广州中山大学英国语言文学系教授及代理系主任。“四·一二”反革命政变后，鲁迅坚决辞去中大一切职务，江亦愤而辞职，并于七月初离粤赴杭，寓居岳父家另谋职业。收到鲁迅的这封佚信及8月17日佚信，均在此时。
      （2）留先：朱家骅（1892—1963），字一作骝先、又作骝仙，浙江吴兴人。早年留学德国，归国后曾任北京大学教授。1927年时任中山大学副校长，主持校务。
      （3）今民厅将卸：朱家骅1927年曾一度被任命为广东省民政厅长，不久由李文范接任。
      （4）不特教厅不稳，即校副亦危：据当时报载，朱家骅被任命为广东省教育厅长时，曾以“专心办理中大”为理由力辞不就；因而仍暂由原厅长许崇清留任。厅长一职人选有无变更，仍有待于国民政府作最后决定。另，当时传闻中大人事亦将有更迭。
      （5）将来当厄于第N次之清党：“N”即数学中的“未知数”；“第N次”即不知是第几次之意。“清党”，指当时国民党反动派破坏第一次国共合作，从国民党中清洗原来根据双方允许“跨党”的协议加入国民党的共产党员和共青团员。当时也有并非跨党加入国民党的国民党员，因涉嫌而被清洗的，所以在国民党内部也弄得人人自危。
      （6）傅之赴港，乃觅何：傅，指傅斯年（1896——1950），字孟真，山东聊城人。“五·四”时期北京大学新潮社主要成员。北大毕业后留学英、德，1926年回国后任中山大学哲学系主任兼文史科主任（相当于后来综合大学的文学院长）。何，指何思源
  （1896——1982），字仙槎，山东菏泽人。北大毕业后留学美、德，当时任中山大学政治训育部副主任。
      （7）而何之某报编辑，则确已归于乌有：某报，指
  《国民新闻》， 1925年国民党在广州创办的报纸。起初宣传国民革命，“四·一二”后被国民党反动派控制，成为反革命喉舌。何思源曾任该报编辑，后因何去南京，编辑一职为他人所取代。
      （8）李：指李济深（1884——1959）字任潮，广西苍梧人。
      （9）偶有“拥护正副校长”云云之贴纸出现：“正副校长”，指戴季陶（1890——1949）与朱家骅。
      “贴纸”，即今之大字报或小字报。
      （10）顾购书教授：指顾颉刚（1893——1980）。顾于1927年4月到中大后，鲁迅以不愿与之共事为理由，决心离开中大。傅斯年致函挽留，并说他“已有补救法，即使鼻赴京买书，不在校”（见《鲁迅全集》第11卷543页致章廷谦信）。故鲁迅在此戏称顾为“购书教授”。
      （11）季黻之预言已渐实现了：季黻，许寿裳字，又作季市。许寿裳（1882——1948），浙江绍兴人，教育家。曾致函鲁迅说，“浙省亦有办大学之事，……我想傅顾不久都会来浙的。”鲁迅以此印证后来傅信中所说使顾“赴京买书，不在校”和顾本人所说“蔡先生留我在南京做事”等语，说明顾早就想只在中大挂名领薪，而于浙大（初名第三中山大学）有所图，如研究教授之类。
　　（参见  《鲁迅全集》第11卷550页致章廷谦信）。
      （12）我因已允往市教育局之“学术讲演会”讲几点钟……：此次讲演内容，即后来定稿的《魏晋风度及文章与药及酒之关系》一文。
    （13）冯大帅：指冯玉祥。
