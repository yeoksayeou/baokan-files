An advanced ship target high-speed real-time automatic, intelligent identification system has been successfully developed by the National University of Defense Technology and passed technical evaluation today.

Ship target identification is a highly challenging technology, and many countries are vigorously conducting research in this area. However, the current state of the art is still some distance from practical application. After taking on this "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key project, the National University of Defense Technology, through four years of arduous exploration, has finally overcome this difficult problem. After conducting real-time identification tests on nearly a hundred passing ships, it has been shown that this system's identification speed for various ships is two orders of magnitude faster than the original equipment, and the identification accuracy has also been significantly improved. This has markedly enhanced the functionality and power of existing equipment, providing a powerful automated technology for guarding our country's waters and for guiding ships entering ports.

　　舰船目标识别系统通过鉴定
    本报北京10月24日讯　一种先进的舰船目标高速实时自动、智能识别系统，由国防科技大学研制成功，今天在此通过技术鉴定。
    舰船目标识别是高难度技术之一，许多国家都在大力开展研究，但目前离实际应用还有相当距离。国防科技大学承担这项“七五”攻关课题后，经过4年的艰苦探索，终于攻下这一难题。经过对近百艘过往舰船的实时识别试验，表明该系统对各种舰船的识别速度比原有的设备提高了两个数量级，识别精度也大大提高，从而明显地提高了现有装备的功能和威力，为我国海域的警戒以及进港船只的导航提供了一项强有力的自动化技术手段。　（王孟陵）
