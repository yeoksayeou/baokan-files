Editor,

A friend of mine had a fire in his kitchen caused by his child playing with fire. The fire destroyed two rooms, including two pieces of wood worth 170 yuan that a neighbor, Mr. Wang, had stored there. Some people think that since the fire was caused by the child, my friend does not need to compensate Mr. Wang. I would like to ask: Should my friend compensate Mr. Wang for the loss? How much compensation would be reasonable?

Deng Zhengying,

In civil law, there is a type of custodial relationship where one person stores items for another. The person storing the items is called the custodian, and the person whose items are stored is called the depositor. In this relationship, the custodian has the obligation to personally and properly store the items deposited by the depositor. Without the depositor's consent, the custodian cannot entrust the items to someone else, use them, or examine them. During the storage period, the custodian should take measures to prevent the items from being damaged or lost. If the items are damaged or lost, the custodian should be responsible for compensation. However, if the loss is due to force majeure, the nature of the goods, or the depositor's actions, the custodian is not responsible. In this custodial relationship, there are two types of storage: unpaid and paid. The obligations of the custodian in these two types of storage are different. The case you mentioned is an example of unpaid storage between citizens, where the custodian should take care of the items as if they were their own. If the depositor's items are lost or damaged, the custodian should compensate the depositor based on the principle of fairness. Therefore, if the depositor finds that the stored items are lost or damaged, they should immediately demand compensation from the custodian or, according to Article 136 of the General Principles of Civil Law, file a lawsuit within one year of knowing the loss or damage. If more than a year has passed, the court will not protect the rights of the parties involved.

The argument that since the fire was caused by a child playing with fire, the parents do not need to compensate is incorrect. Article 133, Paragraph 1 of the General Principles of Civil Law clearly states: "If a person without civil capacity or limited civil capacity causes damage to others, the guardian shall be liable for compensation. If the guardian has fulfilled their guardianship duties, their civil liability may be appropriately reduced." Minors under the age of 16 are considered to have no civil capacity, and there is a guardianship relationship between them and their parents. As guardians, parents are responsible for compensating others when their children cause damage. Therefore, if a child's actions, such as playing with fire, cause a fire that damages others' property, the child's parents, as guardians, are also responsible for compensation. As for the amount of compensation, whether it is full or partial, if the parties involved cannot reach an agreement and a dispute arises, they can file a request with the people's court, which will make a decision based on the specific circumstances.

    木材寄放邻居家保管，遭火灾后是否应索赔？
    编辑同志：
    我的一个同学家因自己的小孩玩火，烧毁厨房两间，其中邻居王某寄存的两根价值170多元的木材也被烧了。有的人认为，火是小孩引起的，我的同学可以不赔偿。请问：我的同学该赔王某的损失吗？赔多少才合情合理？

    邓正营同志：
    民事法律关系中有一种保管关系，其中为他人保管物品的人叫保管人，将自己的物品交付保管的人，称为寄托人。在这种关系中，保管人有义务亲自保管和妥善保管寄托人交付寄存的物品，不经寄托人同意，不得将寄存物品交他人代管，不得使用和翻看保管物品。在保管期间，保管人应采取措施，防止物品毁损，如保管物品发生短缺、毁损的，应负赔偿责任。但是，由于不可抗力、货物自然属性或寄托人原因造成保管物品的损失，保管人是没有责任的。在这种保管关系中，有无偿保管和有偿保管两种形式。这两种形式的保管人，所负的义务也有所不同。你来信所说的是公民之间互助性质的无偿保管，保管人也要像关心自己的东西一样予以保管，否则，给寄托人造成损失时，也应依公平原则承担赔偿责任。因此，寄托人发现寄存物品丢失、毁损，应马上向保管人提出要求，或者根据民法通则第136条的规定，在知道寄存财物丢失或毁损时的一年内，向人民法院提出保护民事权利的诉讼。超过一年，对当事人的权益则不予保护。
    那种认为火灾是小孩玩火引起，因而他的父母可以不负赔偿责任的说法是不对的。民法通则第133条第一款明确规定：“无民事行为能力人、限制民事行为能力人造成他人损害的，由监护人承担民事责任。监护人尽了监护责任的，可以适当减轻他的民事责任。”不满16周岁的未成年人是无民事行为能为人，他与他的家长之间有一种监护关系，家长作为监护人，当被监护人即自己的孩子造成他人损害时，家长要承担民事责任。因此，小孩玩火引起的火灾，造成他人财物损失时，小孩的家长即他的监护人同样要负赔偿责任。至于赔偿多少，是全赔还是部分赔，在双方当事人不能达成一致意见而产生权益纠纷时，可以向人民法院提出请求，由人民法院根据具体情况裁决。
