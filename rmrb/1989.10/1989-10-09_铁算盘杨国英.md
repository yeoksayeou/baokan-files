Yang Guoying, an auditor of the Hunan Provincial Armed Police Logistics Department and a Communist Party member, adheres to principles and meticulously calculates costs in construction budget settlements. Over more than four years, she has audited 332 construction projects, saving 3.9 million yuan, and is praised by people as the people's iron abacus.

Yang Guoying loves her job. With nearly 30 years of work experience, she knows that construction budgets often differ from actual construction costs. She is familiar with some construction teams' methods of embezzling public funds and understands how some construction teams exploit the price liberalization of certain materials to underreport costs in settlement reports. In the latter half of 1986, a construction team undertook a project for the Changde Armed Police Regiment. This construction team, when settling accounts for a wall without design drawings, assumed that the foundation buried underground could not be seen or touched, so they overreported the foundation construction volume. They also overreported the length of the wall, assuming that the audit would only involve a site visit and rough estimation. When Yang Guoying received the settlement for this project, she went to the construction site for a detailed inspection. Based on local geological data and her years of construction experience, she estimated that the construction team had overreported the foundation depth. She also suspected the reported length of the wall. To find the discrepancies, Yang Guoying was not deterred by the hassle and measured the length of the 700-meter wall. She dug a hole every 30 meters along the wall's base, making over 20 holes to measure the foundation depth. After actual measurement, she found that the construction team had overreported the foundation depth by 0.5 meters and the wall length by 80 meters. Faced with the facts, the construction team admitted their mistake. Yang Guoying adjusted the costs based on the actual situation, reducing the expenses by over 25,000 yuan.

Yang Guoying remembers that she is a proud Communist Party member, bearing a heavy responsibility. She set rules for herself: act impartially, do not seek personal gain, do not accept bribes, and do not take gifts. Some construction teams, knowing her reputation as an "iron abacus," tried to bribe her, but all failed. In the latter half of 1986, a construction team undertook a project for the Armed Police Headquarters, with a budget of 285,000 yuan. During the audit, the construction team asked her to be lenient and hinted at offering a "tip." Yang Guoying criticized their dishonorable actions and insisted on reducing the budget by over 60,000 yuan according to regulations. The construction team, seeing the 60,000 yuan reduced without effort, tried to bribe her to get it back. One evening, they brought gifts and a red envelope with 50 "big notes" to her home. Yang Guoying, seeing the gifts and money, immediately understood their intentions. She sternly said, "Don't try this with me. Take your things and money away. What should be given will be given in full, but what shouldn't be given, not a single cent will be given, whether it's 60,000 yuan or even one cent!"

The construction of the office building for the Changsha Chemical Research Institute was contracted to a rural construction team. Last July, during the final settlement, the construction team claimed 1.647 million yuan. The Changsha Chemical Research Institute asked Yang Guoying to help with the audit. Yang Guoying, after thorough verification, initially audited the settlement at 1.267 million yuan, reducing it by 380,000 yuan. Some in the construction team, hearing this news, were furious and threatened to "kill Yang Guoying." Yang Guoying was fearless. The Construction Bank and other departments held a meeting to adjust Yang Guoying's initial audit figure, increasing the settlement to 1.42 million yuan. Yang Guoying presented facts, regulations, and argued for the correctness of her audit figure. Finally, the settlement was reduced to 1.356 million yuan and approved by the higher-level Construction Bank. This project audit saved the state 290,000 yuan.

Yang Guoying's deeds are widely known among the people. She has been consecutively named an outstanding party member of the Hunan Armed Police Corps for three years.

    铁算盘杨国英
    本报记者　吴兴华
    湖南省武警总队后勤部审核员、共产党员杨国英，在基建预算结算中，坚持原则，精打细算，4年多审核基建项目332项，节约经费390多万元，被人们誉为人民的铁算盘。
    杨国英热爱本职工作。近30年的工作经历，她深知工程预算与实际施工常有差距，谙熟一些基建施工队损公肥私的手段，也了解有的基建队利用部分物资价格放开，在决算中以低报高的“名堂”。1986年下半年，某施工单位承包了武警常德支队一项工程。这个施工队在结算没有设计图纸的围墙时，以为基脚打在地下，看不见摸不着，多报一点审核不出来，多报基础施工量；同时，也满以为审核结算顶多现场看看，目测一下，还多报了围墙长度。杨国英接到审核这项工程的结算时，到施工现场仔细察看。她凭着当地的地质资料和多年基建工作的经验，估计施工队多报了基础深度，对施工队报的围墙长度也有怀疑。为了查出漏洞，杨国英不怕麻烦，对700多米围墙的长度进行丈量，对围墙每隔30米在墙脚处挖一个坑，共挖了20多个坑测量围墙基脚深度。经过实际丈量、测量，发现施工队将围墙基脚的深度多报了0.5米，围墙长度多报了80米。在事实面前，基建队只好认错。杨国英根据实际情况，核减了费用2.5万多元。
    杨国英牢记自己是一名光荣的共产党员，肩上担重，给自己立下规矩：秉公办事，不谋私，不吃请，不受贿。一些施工单位知道她这个“铁算盘”的厉害，总想用送礼行贿的办法，从她身上打开缺口，但一个个都碰壁。1986年下半年，某基建队承包了武警总队的一项工程，施工单位预算为28.5万元。杨国英在审核时，施工单位求她笔下留情，并暗示给“好处费”。杨国英批判了施工单位这种不光彩的作法，坚持按照规定，核减了预算费6万多元。施工单位看到不费吹灰之力的6万多元被核减掉，便用行贿的办法想捞回。晚上，他们带着礼品、“红包”到杨国英家里作客。杨国英面对礼品和足有50张
  “大团结”的红包，一眼就看出了这个基建队的用心，声色俱厉地说：“你们别来这一套，东西和钱，你们马上拿走。该给的，一分钱不少给，不该给的，不要说6万，就是一分钱也不能多给！”
    长沙市化工研究所办公楼基建工程包给一个农村建筑队施工。去年7月办决算，工程队提出164.7万元，长沙市化工研究所请杨国英帮助审核。杨国英经过周密查证，第一次审核决算为126.7万元，核减了38万元。建筑队有些人听到这个消息，暴跳如雷，扬言“要杀掉杨国英”。杨国英毫不畏惧。建设银行等部门对杨国英第一次审核的数字开了一个调节会，把决算数调高到142万元。杨国英摆事实，讲规定，据理力争自己的审核数的正确性，最后将决算数降为135.6万元，并得到上一级建设银行的批准。这一项工程审核，杨国英为国家挽回损失29万余元。
    杨国英的事迹在群众中广为传扬。她连续3年被评为武警湖南总队的优秀党员。
