Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 20th.

The recently published 10th issue of *Study* magazine features a lengthy article by Yuan Mu titled "Reflections on Turmoil and Riots." The magazine's editorial board has added an editor's note.

The editor's note in *Study* magazine states: Yuan Mu recently gave a report on the situation at the Central Party School and several units in Beijing. The full text of this report, after being revised by the author, is published for the first time in this issue. The turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred this past summer, as well as the struggle to stop and quell this turmoil and rioting, have become history. After experiencing a tremendous shock, the people's hearts need time to reflect more deeply. As the saying goes, "After the pain, think deeply," the first step is to "think." Only by feeling the pain, thinking deeply, and being moved can we turn the historical calamity into nourishment for the present and future, becoming a heartfelt warning for those involved and for future generations. Yuan Mu has written this "Reflections on Turmoil and Riots" at an opportune time, using Marxist views to deeply reflect on the roots of the turmoil and riots, the nature of our struggle with the planners and commanders of the turmoil and riots, the significance of the victory in stopping and quelling the turmoil and riots, and the series of experiences and lessons this struggle has brought to people. This will undoubtedly be a great push for those who have not yet reflected or reflected shallowly, and for those who have reflected incorrectly or absurdly, it will be a powerful whip. We hope and believe that this "Reflection" will definitely trigger more beneficial and profound "reflections."

Yuan Mu's article points out that observing the current situation in our country cannot be separated from our views on the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred a few months ago. Although we have achieved a decisive victory in stopping the turmoil and quelling the riots, is there still a danger of new turmoil in our country? Do we still need to be prepared for this? Do we still need to base our work on preventing new turmoil, or on consolidating and developing the victory of the struggle to quell the riots? My view is twofold: First, we have stopped the turmoil and quelled the riots. The situation over the past few months shows that the overall situation in the country is getting better and better. Of course, we cannot say it is all good, but it is much better than before. Second, will the small number of stubborn individuals who insist on bourgeois liberalization and political intrigue, the organizers, commanders, and planners of the turmoil and riots, the inhuman few rioters, give up and stop? I don't think so. In general, do people understand the causes of the turmoil and riots? Do they all agree with the party and government's measures to quell the riots? I think the understanding of the vast majority of people is increasingly tending towards the conclusions that should be drawn from the facts, increasingly tending towards unity and correctness, but we should not overestimate this. Of course, it is not surprising that there are still various problems that people cannot understand so soon after such a complex storm.

The article believes that we must further clarify the nature of this struggle. First, it is a sharp reflection of the long-term contradictions between two social systems and two ideologies in the international arena. The intentions of Western imperialism are clear; they always want to change our country's social system and pull our country into the capitalist system. This infiltration and counter-infiltration, subversion and counter-subversion, peaceful evolution and counter-peaceful evolution struggle has always existed and will continue to exist in the future. The struggle will be long-term. They have never given up, but we have been lulled into a state of peace. Second, it is a sharp reflection of the contradiction between the four cardinal principles and the bourgeois liberalization trend at home. Some young comrades do not understand the national conditions of our country and think that if we implement capitalism, China will become America tomorrow (mainly referring to the level of material production). They do not know that if we regress under the conditions of per capita 300-plus dollars and a low level of social productivity, what does that mean? This will inevitably mean that the vast majority of the country will return to absolute poverty below the poverty line, where basic living cannot be guaranteed, and the laboring people will have to cultivate and fatten a new bourgeoisie to rule themselves. China's capitalism will inevitably be the most barbaric, backward, and cruel capitalism. From an international perspective, international monopoly capitalism will not give up so much market to allow China to develop free capitalism. China's regression to capitalism can only be a comprador capitalism.

The article points out that we must fully recognize and deeply publicize the significance of this struggle's victory. What significance? First, it defended the fruits of countless revolutionary martyrs and patriots who, over more than a hundred years, fought selflessly and shed blood for the liberation of the people on this land; second, it defended the victories achieved by the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people in the new democratic revolution and socialist revolution over half a century; third, it defended the fruits of socialist construction over the past 40 years, especially the fruits of socialist modernization and reform and opening up over the past 10 years. If we had not achieved victory in stopping the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary riots, all of this would have been reduced to nothing, and China would have fallen back into chaos and severe internal strife, leading to a great historical setback. The laboring people would again be enslaved and oppressed. The country would again fall into long-term division or civil war. Civil war is probably the most likely outcome. The older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, the vast number of true communists, all supporters of socialism, and all patriots who support national unity, will they allow a small number of counter-revolutionaries to overthrow the Communist Party and overthrow the socialist republic established by millions of martyrs with their blood? I don't think so. They will inevitably fight a civil war with those who want to turn China into a puppet of imperialist countries and a bourgeois republic that is anti-communist and anti-socialist. The result of the civil war, I am sure, will be the victory of the former and not the latter. However, due to the resumption of civil war, China's socialist modernization construction will inevitably be set back for many years.

The article also points out that party comrades, all citizens who love the motherland, especially party cadres, must be prepared for the possibility of new turmoil. To prevent new turmoil and consolidate and develop the victory of the struggle to quell the riots, to ensure that the blood of the martyrs of the People's Liberation Army does not flow in vain, the key is for us to correctly reflect on this turmoil and rioting and draw profound lessons from it. Reflect on what? I would like to offer several opinions for comrades to consider.

	(1) Under the premise of correctly understanding the current international situation and overall pattern, fully estimate the international monopoly bourgeoisie's unyielding desire to destroy us.
	(2) We must, while insisting on taking economic construction as the center, correctly understand that class struggle still exists within a certain range domestically. This is a problem that has been rarely mentioned or not mentioned at all in recent years.
	(3) Fully recognize the long-term existence of the opposition between the four cardinal principles and bourgeois liberalization. Over the years, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always advocated adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, almost every year, sometimes several times a year, but some people, mainly the two former general secretaries of the party, just wouldn't listen and did not seriously implement it. This turmoil and rioting have made us pay a heavy price, but it has also raised our awareness.
	In opposing bourgeois liberalization, we should pay attention to three points. First, prevent it from being a passing fad. Second, effectively prevent simplification and expansion. Third, we must not consciously or unconsciously treat the vast number of intellectuals as the objects of anti-liberalization, but rather guide them to fully realize that opposing liberalization is in the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities in the country, including intellectuals, and is related to the future and destiny of the state and nation, so as to consciously and actively participate in the education and struggle against bourgeois liberalization.

	(4) Clearly distinguish between two different reform and opening-up paths. This is a big deal, related to where our reform and opening-up will be led. Looking back at the past 10 years of reform and opening-up, there indeed have been two opposing paths, or in practice, completely different paths. One path is the one advocated by the Central Committee of the Party and our reform and opening-up chief architect, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, that is, adhering to the socialist road, adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party, and adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in reform and opening-up. This reform and opening-up is what our party often talks about, the self-improvement, self-reform, and self-development of the socialist system. This is the reform and opening-up that our party has always advocated and is currently implementing. The other is the reform and opening-up advocated by those who stubbornly insist on bourgeois liberalization, those who advocate the complete Westernization of China. There are such people both inside and outside the party. The reform and opening-up they advocate is one that is separated from, deviates from, and opposes the four cardinal principles. This reform and opening-up is actually capitalist.

	(5) We must fully recognize the seriousness of the current economic difficulties facing our country, further strengthen our resolve and faith in rectification and deepening reform, and strive to achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. This is the foundation for political and social stability.
	(6) We must fully recognize the seriousness of the party's alienation from the masses. This problem must be highly valued. In a sense, we need to restore, develop, and even rebuild the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the masses.
	(7) We must definitely tackle the problem of certain corrupt phenomena in the party and government organs and the problem of certain unfair distributions in current society as two particularly prominent issues. We must have a very clear attitude on the issue of anti-corruption.
	(8) Our party must also raise the banner of democracy, strengthen the construction of socialist democratic politics, and combine it well with the construction of socialist legal system. At the same time, it must be made clear that the construction of socialist democratic politics in our country must be carried out under the leadership of the party and must not and should not engage in so-called "political pluralism" and multi-party system.
	(9) We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, and enhance the great unity of the people of all nationalities in the country.

The article concludes by emphasizing that everything ultimately depends on building our Communist Party of China into a party that truly has cohesion and appeal among the broad masses of the people, a party that can unite all those who can be united, and a party that can become the strong core of China's revolution and construction. Only then will we have hope. Everything mentioned above is related to this point. We should see that 40 years of practice, and even the practice of modern China over the past 100 years, has proven that the Chinese people have chosen the Communist Party of China to lead them on the socialist road. This is the beginning of a great historical change in China, a correct choice made by the people from long-term historical practice. The achievements we have made over the past 40 years have been made under the leadership of the party, relying on the people's unity and struggle. Our party can be said to have gradually developed, grown, and matured through overcoming difficulties, correcting errors, and summarizing experiences and lessons. The reason why this turmoil and rioting turned into a great disaster is mainly due to problems within the party. It was only after the party corrected the serious errors made by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in supporting the turmoil and splitting the party that we achieved victory in the struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the riots. The problems occurred mainly within the party, and the problems were solved mainly within the party. Therefore, the state of the party determines the future of China's construction and reform and opening-up, determines the future of the country and nation, and the party bears an extremely important historical responsibility that cannot be shirked. Our party will definitely not disappoint the people's expectations and will be responsible and strive to complete its historical mission victoriously.

　　关于动乱和暴乱的反思
    新华社北京10月20日电  新近出版的第10期《学习》杂志发表了袁木的长篇文章《关于动乱和暴乱的反思》，为此《学习》杂志加了编者按。
    《学习》杂志编者按指出：袁木同志最近在中央党校和北京一些单位所作形势报告的全文，经作者修改，首次公开在本刊发表。发生在今年夏季的动乱和反革命暴乱以及制止平息这场动乱与暴乱的斗争已经成为历史。人民的内心在经历了一场惊心动魄的巨大震动之后，时间已经允许而且也迫切需要进行更深入的思考了。所谓痛定思痛，首先是个“思”字。触之痛、思之深、感之切，这才有可能把历史的劫难化为现实与未来的营养，成为对当事者与后人的铭心的警策。袁木同志正是在这种情况下，适逢其时地写出了这篇《关于动乱和暴乱的反思》，运用马克思主义观点对动乱与暴乱发生的根源、我们与动乱暴乱的策划者指挥者之间的斗争性质、制止和平息这场动乱和暴乱的胜利意义，以及这场斗争所带给人们的一系列的经验与教训，都作了中肯的与深刻的反思，对于尚不思考者、思之不深者无疑是个很大的推动，而对于思之荒唐、思之悖谬者，则不啻是个有力的鞭挞。我们希望并相信这篇“反思”一定能够引发出更多的有益而深刻的“反思”。
    袁木的文章指出，观察我们国家的当前形势，离不开对几个月前发生的动乱和反革命暴乱的看法。尽管我们已经取得了制止动乱、平息暴乱的决定性胜利，但是，在我们这个国家还有没有发生新的动乱的危险？我们还有没有必要做这样的思想准备？我们的工作还要不要立足于防止新的动乱，或者说立足于巩固和发展平暴斗争的胜利成果？我的看法是两点论：第一，我们制止了动乱，平息了暴乱，这以后几个月来的形势发展说明，全国总的情况越来越好。当然还不能说一片大好，但是总是比以前好得多了。第二，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化和搞政治阴谋的人，动乱、暴乱的组织者、指挥者、策划者，惨无人道的极少数暴徒，是不是已经甘心失败，就此罢休了？我看还不会。从一般人们的认识来说，是不是对发生动乱、暴乱的原因都弄清楚了？对党和政府平息暴乱的措施是不是都觉得对？我看绝大多数人的认识都在越来越趋于事实应该得出的结论，越来越趋于统一和正确，但也不能估计过高。当然，由于如此错综复杂的风波刚过去不久，有这样那样的问题还想不通，这也不奇怪。
    文章认为，我们一定要进一步说明这场斗争的性质。第一，它是国际范围内两种社会制度、两种意识形态长期矛盾斗争在中国的尖锐反映。西方帝国主义的意图很清楚，它们总是想改变我国的社会制度，把我们的国家拉入到资本主义体系当中去。这种渗透与反渗透、颠覆与反颠覆、和平演变与反和平演变的斗争，过去一直存在，今后还将长期存在，斗争还将是长期的。人家一直都没有死心，前个时期我们却和平麻痹了。第二，它是国内四项基本原则和资产阶级自由化思潮尖锐对立的反映。有些年青同志不了解我们国家的国情，以为一搞资本主义，明天的中国就会成为今天的美国（主要指物质生产水平）。他们就不知道，如果在人均300多个美元，社会生产力水平很低的条件下，倒退回去，搞资本主义，那将意味着什么？这必然意味着全国大多数人重新回到基本生活都不能保障的绝对贫困线以下，要用劳动人民的血汗重新培植和养肥一个资产阶级来统治自己。中国搞资本主义，必然要重新进行原始的资本积累，必然是最野蛮、最落后、最残酷的资本主义。从国际条件来看，国际垄断资本主义不可能让出那么多的市场，来让中国发展自由资本主义。中国退回去搞资本主义，就只能是买办式的资本主义。
    文章指出，我们必须充分认识和深入宣传这场斗争胜利的意义。什么意义？第一，它保卫了一百多年来无数革命先烈、仁人志士在中国这块土地上前赴后继，流血牺牲，为人民解放进行斗争所取得的成果；第二，它保卫了半个多世纪以来，中国共产党领导中国人民，进行新民主主义革命和社会主义革命所取得的胜利成果；第三，它保卫了40年来社会主义建设的成果，特别是这10年来社会主义现代化建设和改革开放成果。如果不是我们取得了制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱这场斗争的胜利，这一切都将统统化为乌有，中国将重新陷入四分五裂，陷入严重内乱，导致历史的大倒退，劳动人民会重新受奴役、受压迫。国家会重新陷入长期分裂，或者打内战。打内战大概是可能性最大的。老一辈无产阶级革命家、广大真正的共产党人、一切拥护社会主义的爱国者和拥护祖国统一的爱国者，他们会容许极少数反革命分子推翻共产党、颠覆几千万烈士用鲜血换来的社会主义人民共和国吗？我看决不会答应。他们同那些硬要把中国变成帝国主义国家的附庸，变成反共反社会主义的资产阶级共和国的人们之间，必然要打一场内战。内战的结果，我肯定胜利的只能是前者而决不是后者。但是，由于重开内战，我国社会主义现代化建设必将因此而倒退许多年。
    文章还指出，我们党内的同志们，一切热爱祖国的公民们，尤其是党员干部，都要有防止新的动乱的思想准备。而要防止新的动乱，巩固和发展平暴斗争的胜利成果，让人民解放军烈士的血不白流，关键的关键，就在于我们对这次动乱、暴乱，进行正确的反思，并从中吸取深刻的经验教训。反思什么？我想讲若干意见，供同志们思考。
      （一）要在正确认识当前国际总形势、总格局的前提下，充分估计国际垄断资产阶级亡我之心不死。
      （二）我们必须在坚持以经济建设为中心的同时，恰当地认识在国内一定范围内仍然存在的阶级斗争。这也是一个时期以来很少讲或者根本不讲了的问题。
      （三）要充分认识四项基本原则同资产阶级自由化的对立，将在我国长期存在。多年来，邓小平同志一直讲坚持四项基本原则，一直讲反对资产阶级自由化，几乎年年讲，有时一年讲几次，但有些人，主要是党的两位前任总书记就是听不进去，不认真贯彻执行。这次动乱和暴乱使我们因此而吃了大亏，但也提高了觉悟。
    在反对资产阶级自由化的问题上，主要应注意三条。一条是防止像过去那样一阵风。第二，要切实防止简单化、扩大化。第三，决不能自觉不自觉地把广大知识分子当成反自由化的对象，而要着力于引导他们充分认识反自由化是包括知识分子在内的全国各族人民的根本利益所在，关系到国家、民族的前途命运，从而自觉地、积极主动地投入到反对资产阶级自由化的教育和斗争中去。
      （四）要明确划清两种不同改革开放思路的界限。这是件大事，关系到我们的改革开放将被引向何方。回顾10年来的改革开放，的确存在着两种对立的思路，或者在实际上截然不同的思路。一种思路，就是党中央和我们改革开放的总设计师邓小平同志一贯主张的，即坚持社会主义道路、坚持人民民主专政、坚持共产党的领导、坚持马列主义毛泽东思想的改革开放。这种改革开放，也就是我们党经常讲的社会主义制度的自我完善、自我改进、自我发展。这是我们党所一贯主张和正在实行的改革开放。另一种就是那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人，主张中国全盘西化的人，这种人党内党外都有，他们所主张的改革开放是同四项基本原则相割裂、相背离、相对立的改革开放。这种改革开放实际上是资本主义化。
    （五）必须充分认识当前我国面临的经济困难的严重性，进一步坚定治理整顿和深化改革的决心和信念，努力实现国民经济的持续、稳定、协调发展。这是政治稳定、社会稳定的基础。
      （六）要充分认识当前我们党脱离群众的严重性。这个问题不能不高度重视。从某种意义上说，要恢复、发展乃至重建党和群众之间的血肉联系。
      （七）一定要把反对党和政府机构中存在的某些腐败现象，和解决当前社会中存在的某些分配不公问题，当做两件十分突出的大事抓紧解决好。在反腐败问题上，我们要有非常鲜明的态度。
      （八）我们党还要高举民主的旗帜，加强社会主义民主政治的建设，并且把它同社会主义法制建设很好地结合起来。同时，必须明确指出，我国的社会主义民主政治建设，必须在党的领导下进行，绝不能也不应当搞什么“政治多元化”和多党制。
      （九）要全心全意依靠工人阶级，巩固工农联盟，增强全国各族人民的大团结。
    文章最后强调说，一切的一切，归根到底在于把我们中国共产党建设成为真正能够在广大人民群众中具有凝聚力、感召力，能够团结一切可以团结的人们的党，能够成为中国革命和建设的坚强核心的党。这样我们就有希望了。前面所说的一切都和这一点相联系。应该看到，40年的实践乃至于中国近代一百多年的实践证明，中国人民选择了中国共产党来领导自己走社会主义道路，这是中国翻天覆地的历史变化的开始，是人民从长期的历史实践中作出的正确选择。这40年来，我们所取得的一切成就，是在党的领导下依靠人民团结奋斗取得的。我们党可以说是在克服困难、纠正错误、总结经验教训中逐步发展、壮大、成熟起来的。这次的动乱暴乱所以酿成一场大祸，主要的问题也出在党内。我们党正是纠正了赵紫阳同志所犯的支持动乱、分裂党的严重错误之后，才取得了制止动乱、平息暴乱这场斗争的胜利的。问题的发生主要在党内，问题之所以能够解决，主要的力量也在党内。因此，党的状况如何，决定着中国建设和改革开放的前途，决定着中国国家、民族的前途，党担负着不可推卸的极其重大的历史责任。我们党也一定能够不辜负人民的期望，担当起并尽责尽力地胜利完成自己的历史任务。
