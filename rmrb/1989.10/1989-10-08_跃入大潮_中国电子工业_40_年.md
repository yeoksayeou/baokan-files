The world's new technological revolution is sweeping forward with great momentum. One of its key markers, electronics technology, is leading the way with rapid advancements. Since the Second World War, the electronics industry has become a crucial strategic industry for developed countries. It is estimated that more than 60% of the economic growth in developed countries is related to the application of computers. Between 1975 and October 1985, the global electronics industry's output value doubled twice, increasing from $80 billion to $320 billion. From satellites and spacecraft to televisions and microwave ovens, electronics technology is ubiquitous, forming the material and technological foundation of modern society and bringing profound changes to human production, life, and even ideology.

The electronics industry in New China faces the challenge of the new technological revolution and bravely joins the global wave of electronics development.

On the eve of liberation, the entire country had only 11 small radio factories with about 4,000 employees. They could only assemble radios, communication equipment, and repair radars using imported components, with an annual output value of only 4.95 million yuan.

By 1988, there were 3,460 electronics enterprises and institutions nationwide, employing over 1.6 million workers. They could produce six major categories of products, including radar, communication navigation, broadcasting and television, electronic computers, electronic components, electronic measurement instruments, and specialized equipment, with an annual industrial output value of 5.938 billion yuan.

As the first Five-Star Red Flag was raised over Tiananmen Square, the waves of the world's new technological revolution were already surging. In 1946, the world's first electronic computer was born. By 1950, the United States' electronics industry output had reached over $3.6 billion.

The founding leaders of New China were keenly aware of the importance of the burgeoning electronics industry. In October 1950, just one year after the founding of the People's Republic, Comrade Liu Shaoqi inspected the Central Electrical Equipment South Factory. In 1956, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the level of electronics is an important indicator of modernization and inspected the Nanjing Radio Factory. That same year, Comrade Zhou Enlai presided over the formulation of the 1956-1967 12-year science and technology development plan, listing computers, semiconductors, ultra-high frequency, electronic instruments, and remote control as key electronic projects.

During the First Five-Year Plan, 11 electronic projects were prioritized for construction, with 9 of them being part of the 156 projects aided by the Soviet Union. The state also allocated over 70 million yuan to upgrade old electronics enterprises along the coast. Through the construction efforts of the 1950s and 1960s, the electronics industry began to take shape as an independent industrial sector in the national economy, and electronic products started transitioning from first-generation vacuum tube products to second-generation semiconductor products.

The Cultural Revolution led the electronics industry down a difficult and winding path. During the Cultural Revolution, when the world's electronics technology was advancing rapidly into the microelectronics era, the chaotic situation and closed-door policy caused China's electronics industry to miss an opportunity for development, widening the gap that had been narrowed in the 1960s.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, China's electronics industry has entered a period of rapid development. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have closely followed the trends of the world's new technological revolution, listing the electronics industry as a strategic industry for the national economy. They have emphasized the development of computers, communications, and microelectronics as key areas to accelerate the growth of the electronics industry. The industry has adjusted its product structure, shifting from a focus on military applications to a combination of military and civilian use, with a primary emphasis on civilian products. Management systems have been reformed, with all enterprises previously under the Ministry of Electronics being transferred to local governments to stimulate their enthusiasm for developing the electronics industry. The industry has also introduced foreign technologies and equipment, with over 1,300 projects and $1.4 billion in deals secured during the Sixth Five-Year Plan alone.

The output value of the electronics industry increased by an average of 17% per year from 1980 to 1988, reaching 5.938 billion yuan in 1988, accounting for approximately 4.9% of the national industrial output value. Electronic products have entered the global market, with an actual export value of $910 million in 1988.

In 1950, the fledgling electronics industry independently designed and produced communication equipment for the volunteer army, ensuring the needs of the troops in battle.

Today, China's electronics industry can produce third-generation radio stations, digital microwave communication equipment, satellite ground stations, and other modern communication devices.

During the Korean War, the electronics industry relied on its own strength to break through foreign economic and technological blockades, laying the foundation for its development. Later, it was also through self-reliance and hard work that the industry overcame numerous difficulties and caught up with the world's advanced levels in some areas.

The successful detonation of atomic and hydrogen bombs, the launch of satellites, the successful launch of carrier rockets, and the construction of positron-electron colliders—these projects, representing the pinnacle of New China's science and technology, all embody the dedication of electronics industry workers and the essence of electronics technology.

The radar industry has developed various satellite and rocket tracking, measurement, attitude, and safety control devices. These devices have participated in China's launches of carrier rockets into the Pacific Ocean, underwater launches of carrier rockets, and the launch of communication satellites, providing stable and reliable data. The missile and satellite radio telemetry system has won the national science and technology progress special prize.

Electronic computers are a symbol of electronics technology, reflecting the level and strength of a country's electronics industry.

In 1958, China successfully developed its first domestically produced vacuum tube computer. From the 1960s to the 1970s, the country largely relied on its own efforts to complete the development of vacuum tube, transistor, and medium- and small-scale integrated circuit computers. In the 1980s, the transition to the fourth generation of large-scale integrated circuit computers began. The DJS-260 computer, the "Galaxy" and "Divine State" billion-transistor computers, the "Tao Te Ching" 2230 32-bit minicomputer, and the "Hua Guang" Chinese character laser typesetting system have reached or are close to the levels of the late 1970s and early 1980s in foreign countries. Electronic computers have a wide range of applications, from scientific calculations to process control, information processing, economic management, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence.

On March 17, 1958, in Beijing, China's first television transmission equipment was test-broadcasted, and over 400 viewers had the privilege of watching television.

By 1988, there were nearly 20,000 television transmission and relay stations nationwide, with 140 million television sets in households, and approximately 600 million television viewers.

From 400 people to 600 million, China's television industry has made significant strides in 30 years, and the driving force behind this development is China's television industry.

In 1958, the Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory successfully trial-produced China's first black-and-white television transmission equipment, and the Tianjin Radio Factory trial-produced China's first black-and-white television set. China's television industry thus began. By 1979, China could produce various television equipment, such as transmitters and converters, meeting the needs of television broadcasting at the central, provincial, municipal, and county levels. In the 1980s, black-and-white television sets entered the stage of large-scale industrial production.

In 1971, the Tianjin Radio Factory successfully developed China's first color television set. In 1973, to accelerate the production of color televisions, Premier Zhou Enlai approved the introduction of foreign color picture tube technology. China sent an expert team to the United States for a study tour. American friends gifted the team a glass snail. During the "Criticize Lin Biao and Confucius" campaign, Jiang Qing made a big deal out of this, creating the infamous "Snail Incident," accusing the introduction of technology as a form of crawling and selling out, and directing the blame at Premier Zhou. The introduction of color tube technology was thus aborted midway.

Due to the long-term inability to solve the problem of key components like color tubes, color television production could not enter the stage of large-scale industrial production. From 1971 to 1980, only about 30,000 color televisions were produced in 10 years. Starting from 1979, China began to introduce color television assembly lines and production technologies and equipment for key components such as color tubes and integrated circuits from abroad, and color television production developed rapidly. By 1988, the production of color televisions had surged to 10.27 million units, ranking third in the world. The quality of color televisions has also reached advanced international levels. Now, the average mean time between failures for color televisions is over 20,000 hours.

Based on the introduction of technology, the color television industry actively absorbs and digests foreign technology, promoting localization. Currently, the localization rate of color television sets has reached over 85%. Some enterprises can produce their own color television production lines. China's independently designed color television TA dual-chip model has passed the design review and entered small-scale production.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, the electronics industry has cumulatively provided nearly 80 million black-and-white television sets, 27 million color televisions, over 200 million radios, and nearly 100 million tape recorders.

To catch up with the world's advanced levels, we need to organically combine self-reliance with the necessary introduction of technology, through introduction, digestion, development, and innovation, utilizing the world's existing advanced electronics technology achievements, and leapfrogging certain development stages to greatly accelerate our progress. The waves of the world's new technological revolution are vast and powerful, and China's electronics industry has a long way to go.

    跃入大潮
    ——中国电子工业40年
    本报记者　皮树义
    世界新技术革命的大潮，声势浩大，一泻千里；新技术革命的重要标志——电子技术，先声夺人，日新月异。
    第二次世界大战以来，电子工业成为发达国家的重要战略产业。据估计，发达国家的经济增长60％以上与计算机应用有关。仅1975年到1985年10月间，世界电子工业产值就翻了两番，由800亿美元增加到3200亿美元。上到卫星、太空船，下到电视、微波炉，电子技术几乎无孔不入，无处不在，成为现代社会的物质技术基础，给人类生产、生活以至观念带来深刻的变化。
    新中国的电子工业面临着新技术革命的挑战，勇敢地跃入世界电子工业发展的潮流。
    解放前夕，全国只有11个小无线电厂，从业人员4000人左右，只能靠进口元器件装配收音机、通信机，修理雷达，年产值仅为495万元。
    1988年，全国有电子企事业单位3460个，职工160多万人，能够生产雷达、通信导航、广播电视、电子计算机、电子元器件、电子测量仪器和专用设备6大类多种产品，年工业总产值593.8亿元。
    当第一面五星红旗在天安门广场冉冉升起之际，世界新技术革命浪潮已经涌动。1946年，世界第一台电子计算机诞生。1950年美国电子工业产值已达36亿多美元。
    惊涛拍岸，新中国的缔造者们关注着新生的电子工业。1950年10月，共和国刚刚诞生一年，刘少奇同志就来到中央电工器材南厂视察。1956年，毛泽东同志指出，电子水准是现代化的一个重要标志，并视察了南京无线电厂。同年，周恩来同志主持制定了1956年至1967年12年科技发展规划，其中，把计算机、半导体、超高频、电子仪器和遥控等电子项目列为重点。
    第一个五年计划，有11项电子工程投入重点建设，其中9个是苏联援建的156项工程中的项目，国家还安排了7000多万元投资，对沿海地区的老电子企业进行技术改造。经过五六十年代的建设，电子工业初具规模，成为国民经济中的一个独立的工业门类，电子产品也开始从第一代电子管产品向第二代半导体产品过渡。
    十年动乱使电子工业走上了艰难曲折之路。“文革”期间，正是世界电子技术突飞猛进、进入微电子阶段之时。动乱的局面，闭关锁国的政策，使中国电子工业丧失了一次发展的机会，把在60年代已经与国外缩小了的差距又拉大了。
    10年改革开放，中国电子工业进入了大发展时期。党中央、国务院密切关注世界新技术革命发展趋势，把电子工业列为国民经济的战略产业。要求以计算机、通信和微电子为重点，加速发展电子工业。电子工业调整产品结构，从军工为主转向军民结合，以民为主；改革管理体制，原电子部所属企业全部下放，以调动地方和企业发展电子工业的积极性；引进国外技术设备，仅“六五”期间，引进项目就有1300多项，成交额14亿美元。
    电子工业产值从1980年到1988年平均每年递增17％，1988年达到593.8亿元，约占全国工业总产值的4.9％。电子产品走向世界。1988年实际出口额9.1亿美元。
    1950年，新生的电子工业自行设计生产了志愿军所需的通信装备，保证了部队作战需要。
    如今，中国电子工业能够生产第3代电台、数字微波通信设备、卫星通讯地面站等现代化通讯设备。
    在抗美援朝战争中，电子工业依靠自己的力量，打破了国外的经济技术封锁，奠定了发展的基础；以后，也正是依靠自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，克服重重困难，使电子工业在一些领域赶上世界先进水平。
    原子弹、氢弹爆炸，卫星上天，运载火箭发射成功，正负电子对撞机建成，这些代表新中国科技尖端水平的项目，都凝结着电子工业职工的心血，聚集了电子技术的精华。
    雷达工业研制的各种卫星和火箭跟踪、测量、姿态和安全控制设备，参加了我国向太平洋预定水域发射运载火箭、水下发射运载火箭、试验通讯同步卫星发射，工作稳定可靠，取得了完整的数据。导弹、卫星无线电测控系统获得国家科技进步特等奖。
    电子计算机是电子技术的标志，反映着一个国家电子工业水平的高低和实力的大小。
    1958年，我国研制成功了第一台国产电子管计算机。从60年代到70年代，基本依靠自己的力量，走完了电子管、晶体管、中小规模集成电路三代计算机的发展历程，从80年代开始向第四代大规模集成电路计算机过渡。DJS—260计算机、“银河”和“神州”亿次计算机、“太极”2230型32位小型计算机、“华光”汉字激光排版系统，已达到或接近国外70年代末80年代初水平。电子计算机有了广泛的应用，从科学计算扩展到过程控制、信息处理、经济管理、情报检索、人工智能等方面。
    1958年3月17日，北京。我国第一套电视发射设备试播，400多位观众有幸坐在电视机旁一饱眼福。
    1988，全国有电视发射台、转播台近两万个，电视机社会拥有量1.4亿多台，电视观众约有6亿人。
    从400人到6亿人，30年间中国的电视事业迈出了一大步，而支撑这一发展的正是中国的电视工业。
    1958年北京广播器厂试制成功了我国第一套黑白电视发射设备，天津无线电厂试制成功了我国第一套黑白电视机。中国的电视工业由此发端。到1979年，我国已能生产发射机、差转机等多种电视设备，基本能够适应中央、省、市、县四级办电视的需要。进入80年代黑白电视机也开始进入大批量工业化生产阶段。
      1971年，天津无线电厂研制成功了我国第一台彩电。1973年，为加速彩电生产，周总理批准引进国外彩色显像管技术。我国派出了一个专家小组赴美国考察。美国朋友向考察小组赠送了礼品——玻璃蜗牛。在“批林批孔”中，江青对此大作文章，制造了轰动一时的“蜗牛事件”，诬蔑引进技术是爬行主义、卖国哲学，把矛头指向周总理，彩管技术引进中途夭折。
    由于彩管等关键件长期不能解决，彩电生产一直不能进入大批量工业化生产。从1971年到1980年，10年只生产了3万余台。从1979年起，我国开始从国外引进彩电装配线和彩管、集成电路等关键件的生产技术和设备，彩电生产迅速发展。到1988年彩电产量猛增到1027万台，位居世界第三。彩电质量也达到世界先进水平。如今彩电平均无故障时间已达2万小时以上。
    在引进的基础上，彩电工业积极消化吸收国外技术，推进国产化。目前，彩电单机国产化水平已达85％以上。一些企业能够自己制造彩电生产线。我国自行设计的彩电TA两片机机型已通过设计定型，并投入小批量生产。
    改革开放10年，电子工业累计提供黑白电视机近8000万台，彩电2700多万台，收音机2亿多台，录音机近1亿台。
    追赶世界先进水平，需要把自力更生精神同必要的技术引进有机地结合起来，通过引进、消化、开发、创新，利用世界上已有的先进的电子技术成就，跳越某些发展阶段，才能大大加快我们前进的步伐。世界新技术革命的浪潮波澜壮阔，中国电子工业任重道远。
