	The Chinese ambassador to Norway, Li Baocheng, was instructed to lodge a serious protest with the Norwegian government today over the decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama.

	Ambassador Li Baocheng solemnly declared that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the Tibet issue is purely an internal affair of China. No foreign government or organization has the right to interfere.

	Ambassador Li seriously pointed out that the Dalai Lama is not just a religious figure but a political exile. He has long been engaged in activities that undermine national unity and split the country. He has encouraged and supported separatist elements both inside and outside Tibet to create unrest and disrupt stability in Tibet. The decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Dalai Lama is a public endorsement of his activities to split China, a gross interference in China's internal affairs, and a serious affront to the feelings of the Chinese people.

	Ambassador Li also pointed out that this decision by the committee is contrary to its stated purpose of rewarding efforts and contributions to "peace and brotherhood among nations." We express great regret and indignation over this erroneous decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

	The Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, October 9 - The Algerian newspaper "El Chaab" published an article on October 8 condemning the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama.

	The article stated that international awards should only be given to those who have made great contributions to all of humanity, but the Nobel Prize was awarded to those who destroy their own countries.

	The article believed that the Norwegian Nobel Committee's sudden selection of the Dalai Lama this year was because "the West's attempt to impose their so-called democratic Western model on China has failed," and "the West has launched a blind attack on China."

	The article in "El Chaab" concluded by saying that the Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded to African nationalist leader Mandela but to the leader of the separatist movement, the Dalai Lama, what value does it have?

    就诺贝尔和平奖给予达赖一事
    我大使向挪威政府严正交涉
    阿尔及利亚报纸谴责给达赖诺贝尔和平奖
    本报斯德哥尔摩10月9日电　记者顾耀铭报道：中国驻挪威大使李宝城今天上午奉命就挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会决定将1989年诺贝尔和平奖给予达赖一事向挪威政府进行了严正交涉。
    李宝城大使郑重声明，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏问题纯属中国内政，任何外国政府和组织都无权进行干涉。
    李大使严肃指出，达赖不是一般的宗教人士，而是一个政治流亡者。他长期从事破坏民族团结、分裂祖国的活动，纵容和支持境内外分裂主义分子在西藏制造骚乱、破坏西藏安定。挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会授奖达赖的决定是对达赖分裂中国活动的公开支持，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，严重伤害了中国人民的感情。
    李大使还指出，这个委员会作出的这一决定也是同其关于为“民族间的和睦亲善作出努力和贡献”的颁奖宗旨相违背的，我们对挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会的这一错误决定表示极大的遗憾和愤慨。
    新华社阿尔及尔10月9日电　阿尔及利亚《人民报》10月8日发表文章，谴责挪威诺贝尔委员会把诺贝尔和平奖授予达赖喇嘛。
    文章说，国际奖只能授予那些为全人类作出巨大贡献的人，但诺贝尔奖却授予那些破坏自己的国家的人。
    文章认为，今年挪威诺贝尔委员会突然选中了达赖，是因为“西方企图将他们所谓的民主的西方模式输入进中国遭到了失败”，“于是，西方向中国掀起盲目攻击。”
    阿尔及利亚《人民报》的文章最后说，诺贝尔和平奖不授予非洲民族领袖曼德拉而授予领导分裂运动的达赖，有什么价值。
