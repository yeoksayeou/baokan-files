Clue Accepts Interview with Japanese Journalists: Socialist Reform Should Not Deviate from Socialist Track

The political situation in China is stable, and the economy continues to develop amid rectification and restructuring.

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 25 (New China News Agency reporter Yang Zidi, Guangming Daily reporter Ma Xiaoyi) Today, Clue, spokesperson for the State Council, accepted an interview with a delegation from the Japanese newspaper "Nihon Keizai Shimbun." He answered questions from Japanese journalists on issues such as the reform of socialist countries, China's economic rectification and restructuring, the current situation in China, and martial law in parts of the capital.

When asked about China's attitude towards the reforms in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, Clue said, "Japanese friends often say, 'Don't meddle in other people's affairs.' I appreciate that. China will not interfere in the affairs of other countries."

He said, regarding the views on socialist reform, we can summarize several basic points based on China's own situation: First, socialism must undergo reform. Without reform, it is impossible to enhance the vitality of the socialist system and fully leverage the inherent advantages of socialism. China will continue to carry out reforms, which is an irreversible historical trend. Without adhering to reform, it would go against the common will and fundamental interests of the people.

Second, we believe that socialist reform is the self-improvement and development of the socialist system. Therefore, it should not deviate from the socialist track.

Third, China's economic reform will not transform the economy, which is predominantly public ownership, into full-scale privatization. While continuing to maintain and leverage the advantages of the socialist planned economy, we will implement a combination of planned economy and market regulation, leveraging the positive role of market regulation. Some foreign observers say that the planned economy and market regulation are incompatible and cannot be combined. We do not share this view. China is striving to explore a path that combines the planned economy with market regulation and has already gained some valuable practical experience in this regard. This path is undoubtedly arduous, but China will persist in following it. This might precisely be the characteristic of China's economic system reform.

He said that in the political domain, China will, under the leadership of the Communist Party, strengthen the construction of socialist democratic politics. We will continue to improve the people's congress system, further expand democracy, and at the same time, strengthen the construction of socialist legal system, ensuring that the two are well integrated. The Communist Party has no reason to fear or reject democracy. However, China will not implement "political pluralism," nor will it adopt a multi-party system or a system of rotating governments. We will continue to adhere to and improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, which is a distinctive feature and advantage of China.

When discussing China's current economic rectification and restructuring, Clue said that rectification and restructuring are essentially an economic adjustment, whose main contents can be summarized in four phrases: reducing demand, adjusting structure, rectifying order, and improving efficiency. Rectification and restructuring do not mean no development. During the period of rectification and restructuring, we will strive to maintain a moderate economic growth rate based on improving economic efficiency, gradually achieving sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

He said that the reform measures introduced before the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, which were approved by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and by the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee, will continue to be implemented. In the process of implementation, we will adjust, supplement, and improve them based on the principle of promoting benefits and eliminating drawbacks.

He said that in the past period, it was correct to emphasize activating the micro-economy, but in a certain sense, macro-control and management were relaxed. Therefore, in the process of deepening and improving the reform, we must pay more attention to establishing and improving the macro-control system to promote stable economic development.

He said: China is currently taking measures to correct the bias of neglecting political and ideological work in the past few years, which is very necessary. In doing so, we will be very careful not to return to the erroneous line of emphasizing "class struggle as the key" before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, nor will we repeat the mistake of "politics overriding everything." Our Party's basic line is "one center, two basic points," that is, focusing on economic construction, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up. This basic line will not change and cannot change. Therefore, the focus on economic construction will not change and cannot change.

When discussing the current situation in China and the issue of martial law in parts of the capital, Clue said that after China achieved a decisive victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, it has only been a few short months, but social order has quickly returned to normal, the political situation is stable, public sentiment is stable, and the economy continues to develop amid rectification and restructuring. This situation fully demonstrates that the vast majority of the Chinese people support and endorse the government's measures to stop the turmoil and suppress the rebellion.

Regarding the issue of martial law, Clue expressed: First, martial law is a correct measure that the Chinese government had to take under the circumstances at that time, playing a decisive role in suppressing the turmoil and the rapid stabilization of the situation in China. It is a stabilizing factor, not a sign of instability; Second, the implementation of martial law is definitely time-limited and not indefinite. This period will not be too long; Third, while the martial law order in parts of the capital has not been lifted, the Chinese government has gradually narrowed the scope and measures of martial law implementation based on the actual situation of the capital's order gradually returning to normal, and will continue to do so based on the situation; Fourth, I cannot provide you with a timetable for the final lifting of martial law at this time.

Clue also pointed out that some foreign friends, out of goodwill, always hope that China will lift martial law as soon as possible to increase foreign friends' trust in China's commitment to opening up to the outside world. We can understand and consider this sentiment and wish. However, some foreigners and individual foreign governments always use whether China lifts martial law, which is purely an internal affair of China, as an excuse to insist on the wrong position and practice of so-called "sanctions" to interfere in China's internal affairs. This is a form of coercion against China, which the Chinese government and people will absolutely not yield to.

Clue also said that we have noted that the French Foreign Minister said a few days ago that the French government does not allow "political refugees" to engage in political activities against governments with which France has diplomatic relations on its territory. We welcome this statement. However, we hope that the French government can match its words with actions.

When asked about China's attitude towards economic and technological cooperation between China and Japan, Clue expressed, "I would like to add that I hope the Japanese media can promote Japan's openness in technology transfer while developing economic and trade relations with China, which will be beneficial for the development of scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries."

The delegation from "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" is visiting China at the invitation of "Guangming Daily."

### 袁木接受日本记者采访时说  社会主义改革不应离开社会主义轨道  我国政局稳定经济在治理整顿中继续发展

　　袁木接受日本记者采访时说
　　社会主义改革不应离开社会主义轨道
　　我国政局稳定经济在治理整顿中继续发展
    新华社北京10月25日电　（新华社记者杨子迪、光明日报记者马晓毅）国务院发言人袁木今天接受了日本《日本经济新闻》社代表团的采访，就社会主义国家的改革、中国经济的治理整顿、中国当前局势和首都部分地区戒严等问题回答了日本记者的提问。
    当问到中国对苏联以及东欧一些国家的改革的态度时，袁木说，日本朋友喜欢用不要随便对别人“说三道四”这句话，我很欣赏，我们中国不会对别的国家“说三道四”。
    他说，关于谈到对社会主义改革的看法，我们从中国自己的情况出发，归纳起来可能有这样几个基本观点：第一，社会主义必须进行改革，不改革就无法增加社会主义制度的活力，无法充分发挥社会主义制度本来具有的优越性。中国还要继续进行改革，这是不可逆转的历史潮流。不坚持改革，就违背了人民的共同意志和根本利益。
    第二，我们认为，社会主义的改革是社会主义制度的自我完善和发展。所以，它不应该离开社会主义的轨道。
    第三，中国的经济改革不会将公有制为主体的经济转向全盘私有化。我们将在继续保持和发挥社会主义计划经济优越性的同时，实行计划经济同市场调节相结合，发挥市场调节的积极作用。国外有人说，计划经济和市场调节是水火不相容的，结合不起来，我们不这样看。中国正在努力探索计划经济同市场调节相结合的路子，并且已经在这方面取得了一些可贵的实践经验。这条路无疑是很艰难的，但中国将坚持沿着这条路走下去。这也可能恰恰是中国经济体制改革的特点。
    他说，在政治领域方面，中国将在共产党的领导下，加强社会主义民主政治的建设。我们要继续完善人民代表大会制，进一步扩大民主，同时加强社会主义法制建设，使两者很好地结合起来。共产党没有任何理由害怕和拒绝民主。但是，中国不会实行“政治多元化”，也不实行多党制，不实行多党轮流执政。我们将继续坚持和完善共产党领导的多党合作制和政治协商制，这是中国的特点和优势。
    在谈到中国当前在经济方面的治理整顿时，袁木说，治理整顿实际上是一次经济调整，其主要内容可以概括为四句话，即压缩需求，调整结构，整顿秩序，提高效益。治理整顿并不等于不发展。在治理整顿期间，我们将在提高经济效益的基础上努力保持适度的经济增长率，逐步实现国民经济的持续、稳定、协调发展。
    他说，党的十三届四中全会以前出台的改革措施，凡是经党中央、国务院批准的，经全国人大或人大常委会批准的，现在都要坚持执行，并在执行的过程中根据兴利除弊的原则，加以调整、补充、改善。
    他说，前一段时间强调经济上的微观搞活是对的，但在某种程度上放松了宏观控制和管理。因此，在深化和完善改革的过程中，要更加注意建立和健全宏观调控体系，以利于促进经济的稳定发展。
    他说：中国最近正在采取措施，纠正前几年忽视政治思想工作的偏差，这是很必要的。我们在这样做的时候，将会十分注意，不要再回到十一届三中全会以前强调“以阶级斗争为纲”的错误路线上去，不再重复所谓“政治压倒一切”的错误。我们党的基本路线是“一个中心，两个基本点”，即以经济建设为中心，既坚持四项基本原则，又坚持改革开放。这条基本路线不会变，也不能变，因此，坚持以经济建设为中心这一点也不会变，不能变。
    在谈到关于中国当前局势和首都部分地区戒严问题时，袁木说，中国取得了制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利之后，到现在还只有短短几个月的时间，但社会秩序迅速恢复正常，政局稳定，人心稳定，经济在治理整顿中继续发展。这种情况充分说明，中国绝大多数人民对政府采取的制止动乱、平息暴乱的措施是支持和拥护的。
    至于戒严问题，袁木表示：一，戒严是中国政府在当时情况下不得不采取的正确措施，对动乱、暴乱的平息和中国局势的迅速稳定起了决定性作用，它是一个重要的稳定因素，而不是不稳定的标志；二、实施戒严肯定是有限期的，不是无限期的，这个限期看来也不会太长；三、在首都部分地区戒严令尚未撤销的情况下，中国政府已经根据首都秩序逐步恢复正常的实际情况，逐步收缩实行戒严的范围和措施，并将继续根据情况逐步收缩；四、我现在还无法向你们提供最终取消戒严的时间表。
    袁木还指出，有些外国朋友从好心出发，总希望中国尽早取消戒严，以利于增加外国朋友对中国坚持对外开放的信任感，对这种心情和愿望我们是能够理解并会予以考虑的。但是，也有的外国人和个别外国政府，总是以中国是否取消戒严这种纯属中国的内部事务为借口，坚持对中国实行所谓“制裁”等干涉中国内政的错误立场和做法，这是对中国的一种要挟，中国政府和人民是绝对不会屈从于这种外来压力的。
    袁木还说，我们已经注意到，法国外长前两天曾说，法国政府不允许“政治避难者”在其领土上进行反对同法国有外交关系的政府的政治活动，对这种表示，我们是欢迎的。但是，我们希望法国政府能够言行一致。
    当被问到对日中两国经济和技术合作的态度时，袁木表示，我附带说一句，希望日本舆论界能够促进日本方面在发展同中国的经济贸易关系的同时，在技术转让方面能够更开放一些，以利于两国科技合作的发展。
    《日本经济新闻》社代表团是应《光明日报》社的邀请前来中国访问的。
