As a unique cultural system of the Chinese nation, Eastern human body culture is a precious treasure of traditional Chinese culture, worthy of exploration and research by all humanity.

Human history is one of continuously understanding and adapting to nature, as well as understanding and perfecting oneself. All sciences, technologies, and arts serve this purpose. Art is like a colorful auspicious cloud that people step on to ascend to a clear, happy, and beautiful paradise. When it forms into a mist, it begins with the understanding and pursuit of human beauty. In fact, all cultures start with the protection and understanding of the human body, the satisfaction and adornment of oneself. Therefore, I believe that human body culture is the origin and forerunner of all human cultures. Whether it is the macro exploration of the universe, the micro study of neutrons, or the pursuit of advanced or simple arts, the goal is still for humans, for the beauty and well-being of the living body and mind with the most precise information control system. Eastern human body culture, in its pursuit of harmony between humans and nature and the environment, and in delaying the deterioration of life, has preserved and sublimated many practical experiences and wisdom of the Chinese nation that transcend the consciousness of the times.

Eastern human body culture can be said to be a cluster of flowers, with a hundred blossoms blooming. It involves many disciplines and can be said to be rooted in the eight extremities. As a cultural system, I believe that it should at least be studied comprehensively from five aspects:

1. Unique Eastern human body art. This includes the rhythm of classical dance, the folk customs and deep-layered codes of national character conveyed by folk dance, and the unique aesthetics of ancient acrobatics and opera dance. Recently, the Eastern Dance Troupe's dancers Zhang Jun and Yu Haiyan held an appreciation evening of Dunhuang Dance and Indian Dance, marking a good beginning for the comparative study of Eastern human body art.

2. Rich and varied Eastern martial arts research. Although Chinese martial arts, like martial arts from other countries, are the sublimation of self-defense instincts and the accumulation of attack and defense techniques, due to the unique historical background and philosophical and ethical systems of the Chinese nation, it has a unique development path and rich content. The health-preserving and body-strengthening, tempering, and emotional value of martial arts far exceeds its value as a military technology. However, its athletic value cannot fully represent its deep-seated Eastern philosophy, ethics, and the close kinship and interpenetration with traditional performing arts such as dance, opera, and acrobatics. Therefore, we call it a unique and excellent human body cultural heritage of the Chinese nation. The study of martial arts culture has been put on the agenda, and the excavation and rescue of folk martial arts are even more urgent.

3. Unique Eastern life science of Qigong, its history, mechanism, effects, and special role in Eastern civilization. As a means of exercise for health preservation, longevity, and medical treatment, it has attracted the attention of the public at home and abroad. However, research from the perspective of national culture, thinking mode, and philosophical level has not yet begun. In fact, since ancient times, China has had a "Qi culture" system, and Qigong can be said to be the core of various traditional physical skills.

4. The study of Eastern ecological art. The philosophy and artistry of Chinese gardens, the relationship between indoor decoration and health, and aesthetics.

5. Establishing a historical and theoretical system of Eastern human body culture based on the ontological characteristics of Eastern human body culture and comparative art history. Whether it is the study of art history or the promotion of Chinese civilization, and strengthening the independent spirit of self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reliance of generation after generation of descendants of the Yellow Emperor, we need to study Eastern human body culture.

    花开百朵　根植八荒
    ——东方人体文化漫话
    峻骧
    作为中华民族独特的文化体系之一的东方人体文化，是中华民族传统文化的一份珍贵宝藏，值得全人类探索和研究。
    人类历史是不断认识自然、适应自然，也是不断认识自身、完善美化自身的历史，一切科学技术、学术艺术，都是为了这个目的，艺术这片人们踩着它升入明净幸福美妙天国的五彩祥云，在它氲氤成气之际，也是从对人类自身的美的认识和追求开始的。其实一切文化，它的发韧之始，都是从人体自身的保护和认识、满足和雕饰开始的。因此，我认为人体文化是人类一切文化的母体和先声。不管是宏观的宇宙探索、微观的中子研究，还是一切超前的或纯朴的艺术追求，目的还是为了人，为了活着的、具有最精密的信息调控系统的身体和心灵的美好与安泰。东方人体文化在追求人与自然、环境的协调统一，延缓生命的衰败过程中，保存和升华了中华民族许多超越时代意识形态的实践经验和人生智慧结晶。
    东方人体文化可谓花团锦簇、花开百朵，它所涉及的学科甚多，可谓根植八荒。作为一个文化体系，我认为，起码应当从五个方面进行综合比较研究：
    一、独特的东方人体艺术。包括古典舞的韵律，民间舞所传递的民风、民俗和民族性格深层互感的密码，古老的杂技和戏曲舞蹈的独特美学。最近东方歌舞团的张均、于海燕两位舞蹈家，搞了一台敦煌舞与印度舞的鉴赏晚会，是东方人体艺术比较研究的良好开端。
    二、丰富多姿的东方武术研究。中国武术虽然与世界各国武技一样，是自卫本能的升华和攻防技术的积累，但由于中华民族独特的历史背景和哲学、伦理学体系的影响，它有着独特的发展道路和丰富的内容，武术的养生健体、冶性陶情的体育价值，远远超过它作为军事技术的价值，而它的体育价值，又远远不能概括它深寓东方哲理、伦理，与舞蹈、戏曲、杂技等传统表演艺术亲如手足的血缘与互渗、丰厚而广袤的文化内涵。因此我们称它为中华民族独特的优秀人体文化遗产。武术文化学的研究已经提到议程上，民间武学精髓的发掘和抢救更为迫切。
    三、东方独特的生命科学气功，它的历史、机理、效应和在东方文明中的特殊作用。作为保健、养生和医疗的锻炼手段，已经受到海内外公众的注目，但从民族文化和思维方式、哲学层次上的研究，却至今没有开始。其实自古以来，中国就有一个“气文化”体系存在，气功可以说是各种传统形体技艺内功的核心。
    四、东方生态艺术的研究。中国园林的哲理和艺理、室内装饰与健康、美感的关系等。
    五、以东方人体文化的本体特征和比较艺术史为基点建立东方人体文化学的史论体系。不管是治艺术史学，还是为弘扬中华文明，增强一代代炎黄子孙的自信、自强、自立于世的独立精神，都要求我们进行东方人体文化学的研究。
