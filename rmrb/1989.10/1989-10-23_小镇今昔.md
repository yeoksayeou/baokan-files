In the southwestern part of Guizhou Province, there is a town named Hua'gong in Qingtian County. Though the town is not large, it is the main town in this area within a radius of thirty to fifty miles. Here reside the Miao and Bouyei ethnic minorities, as well as cadres and workers from a tea plantation.

In 1953, a group of soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, after completing their mission of suppressing bandits, were dispatched by the Party and the government to establish a farm in Hua'gong. At that time, Hua'gong consisted of only a few scattered households and seven or eight dilapidated huts. Wild beasts roamed at night. Decades have passed, and the scene of Hua'gong in those days seems like a legend or a faded dream.

How much effort has the Party and the government invested here? How much have the people of various ethnic groups sacrificed and contributed? The tombstones on the hills, the winding mountain roads, the buildings, and the modern facilities all bear witness to this.

In the past, Hua'gong was very isolated. The surrounding mountains blocked the outside world and confined the inside. Salt merchants' packhorses were like angels, but who knew what the world outside the mountains looked like? This was all due to the inconvenience of transportation. The builders of the farm, while establishing the farm, also focused on solving the transportation problem. Under the organization and leadership of the government, the local Miao and Bouyei people contributed labor and materials, working together with the farm's cadres and workers day and night. In just a few years, they completed roads to Pu'an, Liuzhi, and Qingtian. Now, cars travel on the mountains, and people wander in the mist, no longer sighing at the sight of the mountains.

In the old society, medical care and medicine were scarce, and diseases like cholera and malaria took countless lives. According to relevant records, the average lifespan here before liberation was only about 30 years. The farm built a hospital here and, over the years, assisted the local government in preventing and treating diseases for the people, improving medical and health conditions. The health level of the people has greatly improved. According to the 1982 national census data, the various indicators of the population here have reached the national level.

It is said that during the imperial examination era, Hua'gong once produced a scholar named Hua. Whether the name Hua'gong originated from this is uncertain.

However, in recent years, the number of college and vocational students from Hua'gong is well-documented. Since 1977, nearly a hundred Miao and Bouyei ethnic minority students have been sent to colleges and vocational schools from the Hua'gong Tea Plantation School, not to mention those who have graduated from junior and senior high schools. Currently, the enrollment and retention rates of school-age children in rural areas here are both above 90%. Schools reduce tuition fees for minority students and prioritize solving their accommodation and dining problems. Among the students, local minority students account for nearly half.

The Party's policy of enriching the people has brought new vitality to this region. The local ethnic minorities have utilized the advantages of the mountainous economy to vigorously develop commodity production, and their lives are far better than before. Many families have purchased modern household appliances such as televisions and washing machines. On market days, the market is bustling with a variety of goods, as lively as a temple fair in the north. The young men are full of vigor, and the girls are elegant, adding charm to the town.

　　小镇今昔
　　李善堂
    贵州省西南部的晴隆县境内，有一个花贡镇。镇虽不大，但却是这一带方圆三五十里的首镇。在这里居住的有苗人，布依人，还有茶场的干部、工人。
    1953年，一批南下的解放军战士，在完成剿匪任务后，受党和政府的派遣，在花贡建立起了农场。当年的花贡，三五户零星人家，七八间破烂草棚，土豹野猪夜夜叫。几十年过去了，当年花贡的景象像是一个传说、又像是一场逝去的梦。
    党和政府在这里花费了多少心血？各族人民做出了多大的努力和牺牲？那山坡上一座座墓碑，那一条条的盘山公路，那一幢幢的楼房，那一台台、一件件的现代化的设置都是见证。
    往日的花贡十分闭塞，那四面的大山挡住了外面，关住了里面；盐贩子的驮马宛如天使，有几个人知道山外是什么样子？这都是交通不便的缘故。农场的建设者们于建场的同时，就着力解决交通问题。当地的苗族、布依族同胞们在政府的组织领导下，有力出力，有物出物，与农场广大干部、职工一起，日夜奋战，在短短的几年时间里，便修通了至普安、六枝、晴隆等地的公路，如今，车在山上过，人在雾中游，再也不望山兴叹了。
    旧社会，这里缺医少药，霍乱、疟疾无情地吞噬人们的生命，据有关资料记载，解放前这里的人均寿命只有30多岁。农场在这里建了医院，多年来协助地方政府为群众防病治病，改善医疗卫生条件，群众的健康水平大大提高。据1982年全国人口普查的材料，这里人口的各项指标均达到全国水平。
    据说，花贡在科举时代，曾出过一个姓花的贡生，花贡的名字是否由此而来，无据可考。
    但这些年，花贡考出的大学生、中专生确是有据可查的，仅自1977年以来，在花贡茶场学校考出的苗族、布依族大、中专学生就有近百名，更不用说在学校毕业的初、高中学生啦。目前这里农村学龄儿童的入学率、巩固率都在90％以上。学校对少数民族子女少收学费、优先解决食宿问题。在校生中，当地少数民族子女几乎占一半。
    党的富民政策给这个地区带来了新的生机。这里的少数民族同胞利用山区经济资源的优势，大力发展商品生产，生活远非昔比。不少人家都置上了电视机、洗衣机等现代生活用品。赶场天，市场上商品琳琅满目，热闹得像北方的庙会。小伙子们朝气蓬勃，姑娘们仪态万方，更为小镇添姿增色。
