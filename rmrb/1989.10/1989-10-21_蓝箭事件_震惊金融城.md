Recently, the British National Westminster Bank, which has long enjoyed a high level of credit and is one of the world's largest banks in terms of capital, faced a crisis due to the exposure of "illegal" operations by one of its subsidiary banks. The chairman and three deputy directors resigned. People believe that this incident has "opened a large gap in the highest management structure of the National Westminster Bank," and the "financial giant" has paid a "high price" for the "illegal" operations in the "Blue Arrow Incident."

The so-called "Blue Arrow Incident" refers to the "illegal" behavior of the National Westminster Bank's subsidiary commercial bank, "Conti National Westminster," in issuing stocks for the British Blue Arrow Company, which caused a stir. Last year in September, Conti, on behalf of the Blue Arrow Professional Introduction Company, issued preferential stock rights to raise $1.4 billion to acquire the American human resources introduction company. Coincidentally, in October 1987, the global stock market experienced a major crash, and 13.4% of Blue Arrow Company's total shares, equivalent to its total equity, could not be sold and remained unsold. According to British company law, any company holding more than 5% of the shares of a listed company must disclose this information. Conti, in order to cover up the failure of the stock transaction, did not disclose this, retaining 4.9% of Blue Arrow Company's shares for itself, and the remaining shares were dispersed to other institutions.

Half a year later, the National Westminster Bank Group published its 1987 operating results, and due to the fact that the stock price of Blue Arrow Company had not yet risen, the loss of several million pounds from the shares purchased by Conti and its affiliated institutions was finally exposed. In December last year, the Department of Trade and Industry, which is responsible for managing the financial market, began a comprehensive investigation into the Blue Arrow Incident. The investigation report recently published stated that Conti had "intentionally violated the regulations on the disclosure of shareholding situations." It is said that this case may eventually lead to a lawsuit. Both Conti and the National Westminster Bank have objections to the "report's" criticism. However, the Department of Trade and Industry investigation team insists that the business guidance of the relevant responsible persons was "far below the recognized standards" and that they did not have sufficient understanding of the subordinates' business, thus failing to discover the illegal problems. The Bank of England, which is renowned for its supervision of the banking industry, has this time "strictly" required the National Westminster Bank. It is reported that it may also prevent some people who were forced to resign from working in the banking industry again in the future.

The British government has taken a stern attitude towards the handling of the "Blue Arrow Incident," aiming to maintain London's reputation as an important international financial center. London is one of the world's three major financial centers. During the ten years of the Thatcher government, the "sick man of Europe" hat was removed, and the British financial industry made significant contributions. The government's annual income from here accounts for more than half of its intangible trade income. In 1988 alone, the international business income from banking, insurance, securities, and other sectors reached 10 billion pounds. Public opinion believes that in the face of increasingly fierce competition in the international financial industry, it is necessary to severely crack down on such "deception" and "illegal" incidents. As the *Times* said, this is "aimed at maintaining the credibility of the financial city."

　　“蓝箭事件”震惊金融城
　　陈特安
    前不久享有很高级信誉、按资本计算为世界大银行之一的英国国民威斯敏斯特银行因一附属银行“违法”经营败露而发生危机，董事长及三位副行长辞职。人们认为，这“在国民威斯敏斯特银行的最高管理结构中撕开了一个很大的缺口”，“金融巨人”为“蓝箭事件”中的“违法”经营付出了“高昂的代价”。
    所谓“蓝箭事件”，指的是国民威斯敏斯特银行附属商业银行“康蒂国民威斯敏斯特”代表英国蓝箭公司发行股票中的“违法”行为引起的一场风波。前年9月，康蒂代表蓝箭职业介绍公司发行优惠权股票，拟筹资14亿美元收购美国的人力职业介绍公司，恰逢1987年10月世界性股市暴跌，相当于蓝箭公司总股权13.4％的股票未能售出，砸在手里。按英国公司法规定，任何公司拥有证券交易所上市公司股权的5％以上都必须公开。康蒂为掩盖股票交易上的失败，而没有公开，除自己保留相当于蓝箭公司股权4.9％的股权外，剩余股权分散到其他一些机构。
    半年后，国民威斯敏斯特银行集团公布1987年经营结果数字，由于蓝箭公司股票价格仍未上升，康蒂及其附属机构所购股权总计达数千万英镑之巨的亏损终于暴露。去年12月，负责管理金融市场的贸工部开始对蓝箭事件进行全面调查，前不久公布的调查报告称康蒂在此案中“有意违反必须公开股权拥有情况的规定”。据说，此案最后甚至有可能导致起诉。对于“报告”的这种批评，康蒂和国民威斯敏斯特银行都持异议。但贸工部调查小组坚持认为，有关负责人的业务指导“大大低于公认的标准”，对下属业务没有足够的了解，从而未能发现违法问题。对银行业监督颇负盛名的英格兰银行此次照例“严格”要求国民威斯敏斯特，据报道，它还可能不准某些被迫辞职的人今后重新在银行业供职。
    英国政府对“蓝箭事件”的处理持严厉态度，旨在维护伦敦作为国际重要金融中心的声誉。伦敦是世界三大金融中心之一。玛·撒切尔政府执政十年，摘掉“欧洲病夫”帽子，其中英国金融业贡献甚丰，政府每年从这里获得的收入占其无形贸易收入的一半以上，仅1988年，银行、保险、证券等项的国际业务收入就高达100亿英镑。舆论认为，在国际金融业竞争日趋激烈的形势下，严厉整肃此类“欺骗”“违法”事件，正如《泰晤士报》所说，是“着眼于维护金融城的信誉”。
