In our city's inspection of individual industrial and commercial households, individual lessees and contractors, and personal income adjustment tax payers, it was found that those who evaded taxes amounting to over 100,000 yuan were almost all individuals operating under the guise of "state-owned" or "collective" enterprises. The amount of tax evaded reached 4.86 million yuan, accounting for approximately one-fourth of the total inspection amount.

Among the 18 tax-exempt operational units in the Mining Bureau system, 10 are individual operations disguised as state-owned or collective enterprises. In Tianning District, 11 out of 37 small school-run factories are individually operated.

These individual enterprises, under the names of state-owned or collective enterprises, enjoy various national preferential policies, with a large amount of benefits flowing into the pockets of these individual operators. For example, the biggest tax evader in our city, Yuan Jie Sheng (currently arrested), used the state-owned and collective enterprise names to illegally purchase and resell scarce national resources. In just over a year, he alone traded 1.7 million meters of cloth, underreporting business revenue by 4.09 million yuan and evading taxes of 400,000 yuan.

These individual operators not only evade taxes but also engage in bribery and corruption, corrupting officials. Some leaders of enterprises and institutions disregard the law, secretly making "gentlemen's agreements" with individual operators, selling state-owned and collective enterprise licenses, and embezzling public funds for personal gain.

A certain chemical trading company's contractor, in less than a year, spent on "paving the way" the following items: 13 color televisions, 9 refrigerators, and a price difference of 25,900 yuan for high-in, low-out transactions; 30 small tape recorders, each worth 218 yuan, were given out during the opening; 500 pig legs and other items worth over 51,000 yuan were given out during the Spring Festival; and various aquatic products such as crabs and soft-shelled turtles worth over 11,000 yuan were given out regularly. Currently, this individual operator has been found to have evaded taxes of over 100,000 yuan.

### 假全民、假集体企业偷漏税严重

　　假全民、假集体企业偷漏税严重
    我市在对个体工商业户、个体租赁承 包者和个人收入调节税纳税人的检查中，发现偷漏税款达10万元以上的大户，几乎全是挂着“全民”或“集体”招牌的个体经营者，偷漏税金额达486万多元，约占检查总数的1／4。
    在市矿务局系统免税的18个经营单位中，竟有10个是挂国营、集体牌照的个体经营企业。天宁区37个小学校办工厂中有11个属个人承包。
    这些个体企业以全民或集体企业的名义，享受着国家的各种优惠政策，大量肥水流入了这些个体经营者的腰包。如我市最大的偷漏税者袁解胜（现已逮捕），凭借国营、集体的招牌，用非法手段大肆套购倒卖国家紧俏物资，一年多来，仅倒腾坯布就达170多万米，瞒报营业额409万元，偷漏税达40万元。
    这些个人经营者不仅偷税漏税，而且行贿送礼，腐蚀干部。有些企事业单位的领导干部则置国法不顾，暗地里与个人经营者订“君子协定”，出卖国营、集体牌照，慷国家、集体之慨，中饱私囊。
    某化工经营公司承包人，在不到一年的时间，用于“开路”的钱物有：13台彩电、9台冰箱、高进低出送差价25900元；开业时还送出每台价值218元的小收录机达30台。春节时还送出猪腿500只以及其它物品，价值51000多元；平时送出的螃蟹、甲鱼等水产品也有11000多元。目前这个个体经营者已被查出漏逃税10多万元。
