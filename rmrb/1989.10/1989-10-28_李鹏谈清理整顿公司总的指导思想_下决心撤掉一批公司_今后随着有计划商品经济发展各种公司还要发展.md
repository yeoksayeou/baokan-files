Li Peng on the Overall Guidance for Clearing and Rectifying Companies

	Down Decisively a Batch of Companies

	In the Future, as the Planned Commodity Economy Develops, Various Types of Companies Will Still Need to Develop

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 27th — (Reporter Chen Yun) Premier Li Peng this afternoon at Zhongnanhai listened to a report on the situation of the national symposium on clearing and rectifying companies. He said that the current overall guidance for clearing and rectifying companies is to decisively shut down a batch of companies. However, this does not mean that companies are not needed. In the future, as the planned commodity economy develops, various types of companies will still need to develop.

	Li Peng said that the main problem in recent years has been that companies have developed too many, too disorderly, and too recklessly. This has not only been detrimental to economic development but has also caused chaos in the circulation sector, driven up prices, fostered corruption, and affected the relationship between the Party and the government with the people. Therefore, clearing and rectifying companies is necessary for improving the economic environment, rectifying economic order, promoting clean governance, and further strengthening the relationship between the Party and the government with the people.

	Li Peng said that in the previous period, the Ninth Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress listened to the report on clearing and rectifying companies and put forward good opinions and suggestions. Now, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have strengthened the leadership of clearing and rectifying companies and taken a series of measures to promote this work. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have done this, and all regions and departments should also do this.

	Li Peng required that in clearing and rectifying companies, first, the resolve must be firm; second, organizational leadership must be strengthened; third, the aftermath of company mergers and closures must be handled properly; fourth, the central government and the State Council and their various departments must take the lead in doing this work. He said that clearing and rectifying companies is a very complex and policy-intensive task. When encountering resistance and difficulties, Comrade Jiang Zemin and he will definitely come out to support everyone, and he also requires that the secretaries and governors of all provinces should also come out to support everyone.

	Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, State Councilor Zhou Jiaxuan, and the leader of the military's company clearing and rectifying leading group, Hong Xuezhi, attended today's meeting. Secretary-General of the State Council Luogan reported on the symposium situation.

　　李鹏谈清理整顿公司总的指导思想
　　下决心撤掉一批公司
　　今后随着有计划商品经济发展各种公司还要发展
    新华社北京10月27日电　（记者陈芸）国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海听取全国清理整顿公司座谈会情况汇报时说，当前清理整顿公司总的指导思想是下决心撤掉一批公司，但这不等于不要公司。今后，随着有计划商品经济的发展，各种不同类型的公司还是要发展的。
    李鹏说，这几年的主要问题是公司发展过多、过乱、过滥，这对经济发展不仅没有好处，反而造成了流通领域的混乱，推动了物价上涨，助长了社会腐败现象，影响了党和政府与人民群众的关系。因此，清理整顿公司是治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的需要，是廉政建设的需要，也是进一步密切党和政府与人民群众关系的需要。
    李鹏说，前一段，七届全国人大常委会第九次会议听取了清理整顿公司的汇报，提出了很好的意见和建议。现在，党中央、国务院加强了清理整顿公司的领导机构，采取了一系列推动这项工作的措施。党中央、国务院已经这样做了，各地区、各部门也要这样做。
    李鹏要求，清理整顿公司一要决心大；二要加强组织领导；三要妥善处理好公司撤并后的善后工作；四是中央和国务院及其各部委要带头做好这项工作。他表示，清理整顿公司是一件很复杂而政策性强的工作，在遇到阻力和困难时，江泽民同志和他一定会出来为大家撑腰，并要求各省的书记和省长也要出来为大家撑腰。
    国务院副总理田纪云、国务委员邹家华、全军清理整顿公司领导小组组长洪学智，出席了今天的会议。国务院秘书长罗干汇报了座谈会情况。
