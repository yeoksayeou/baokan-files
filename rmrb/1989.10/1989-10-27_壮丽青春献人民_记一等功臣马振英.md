He left without leaving a single word.
He did not take away a single blade of grass or a single tree from the people of Fengcheng, but he left behind a life story that is both tragic and inspiring.
His name was Ma Zhenying. He was a medic in the Anhui County detachment of the Wuhan Armed Police Corps, an ordinary soldier who dedicated his youth and blood to saving the life of a young teacher, fulfilling his wish to "dedicate a splendid youth to the people."

The detachment's officers will never forget that when all the doors and windows of the detachment had their paint peeling off, it was Ma Zhenying who bought the paint at his own expense and repainted them all.

The cooks will never forget that during holidays, Ma Zhenying helped them wash vegetables and cook meals countless times.

Soldier Chen Jisheng will never forget that during the week he was sick with a fever, it was Ma Zhenying who brought him meals and medicine every day.

Mrs. Yu will never forget that over the past year, it was Ma Zhenying who bought her rice and coal and took care of her daily life.

He was honorably admitted to the Party organization, and the higher-level Party committee awarded him a third-class merit citation. He was commended three times by the detachment's Party branch and was promoted from sergeant to senior sergeant ahead of schedule.

In mid-August of this year, the Anhui County government decided to clear roadblocks along the highway based on a report from the public security authorities. On August 23, Ma Zhenying and his comrade-in-arms Dong Congwu, along with several public security officers, were tasked with clearing roadblocks. Around 3 PM, they and a large bulldozer arrived at a three-room stone house under construction in Chiling Village, Guanqiao Town. The bulldozer moved forward and decided to demolish the balcony that extended into the road, which had been notified to the owner to be removed. At this time, more than 600 men, women, and children were gathered around the bulldozer watching the spectacle. Little Ma and several other comrades tried to persuade the onlookers to leave the danger zone while maintaining order. Around 3:15 PM, the bulldozer's bucket was pressed against the bottom of the middle layer of the balcony, increasing the power to lift it. Thousands of pounds of stone slabs were lifted. This slab was connected to the stone slab on the left side of the balcony. As the middle slab was lifted, the left side also loosened, and as the bucket rose, the left slab broke off, about to fall. At this critical moment, the young teacher Lin Aihua, who was unaware of the danger, was about to be involved in a bloody incident. In this split second, Ma Zhenying took a quick step forward and forcefully pushed the young woman out of the way. Just as he was about to dodge, a stone slab 2.8 meters long and weighing about 800 pounds fell from a height of 3.8 meters onto Ma Zhenying's left shoulder. Little Ma immediately fell into a pool of blood.

In the hospital, the rescue operation was proceeding urgently. The people of Guanqiao Town heard that Ma Zhenying had been injured while saving the female teacher, and more than 1,000 people braved the pouring rain to rush to the hospital, standing outside the emergency room waiting for the doctor to report that everything was alright.

The emergency room door opened, and when the news that the rescue had failed was announced, the people burst into tears...

The rescued young female teacher, Lin Aihua, came. She knelt down in front of the martyr's mother, sobbing, "It was your son who gave me a second life. You are my parents..."

　　壮丽青春献人民
　　——记一等功臣马振英
　　吴文先　刘志勇
    他走了，没有留下一句遗言。
    他没有带走风城人民的一草一木，却留下了可歌可泣的人生赞歌。
    他叫马振英，是武警福建总队泉州支队安溪县中队卫生员，一个普通的战士，用青春热血保住了一名青年教师的生命，实现了他“壮丽青春献人民”的夙愿。
    中队干部不会忘记，中队所有门窗的油漆脱落了，是马振英自费买来油漆重新漆了一遍。
    炊事班的战士不会忘记，马振英节假日不知帮他们洗过多少次菜，煮过多少次饭。
    战士陈积生不会忘记，在他发烧生病的一个星期中，是马振英一天天给他端饭喂药。
    余大娘不会忘记，一年多来，是马振英为她买米买煤，照顾她的生活。
    他光荣地加入了党组织，上级党委给他记了一次三等功。三次受到中队党支部的嘉奖，并由中士警衔提前晋升为上士警衔。
    今年8月中旬，安溪县政府根据公安机关上报的情况，决定对公路一线的乡镇进行一次路障清除。8月23日，马振英和战友董丛武与县公安局几位同志一起担任清除路障的警戒任务。下午3时许，他和大家随一辆大型推土机来到官桥镇赤岭村一栋三间石头结构未完工的民房时，推土机开了过去，决定铲掉伸向马路、早已通知主人应拆除的阳台。这时，有600多名男女老少围着推土机看热闹，小马和另几个同志一面劝阻围观群众离开危险区，一面维持秩序。3时15分左右，推土机的铲斗顶在中间层的阳台下，加大马力往上升，上千斤重的石条被顶起来了。这根石条和左边一间阳台的石条相连，中间石条块一顶起，左边也松动了，随着铲头上升，左边的石条断裂开，眼看就要掉下来，就在这时，在场的青年教师林爱花毫无察觉，一场流血事件就要发生，在这千钧一发之际，马振英一个箭步冲上去，用力将这名女青年推开。他刚要躲闪，一块长2.8米、重约800多斤的石板从3.8米高的阳台上砸在马振英的左肩部位，小马当即倒在血泊中。
    医院里，抢救工作紧张地进行。官桥镇的群众听说马振英为抢救女教师被砸伤，1000多人冒着倾盆大雨赶到医院，站在急救室门口等候着医生报平安。
    急救室门开了，当抢救无效的消息传出时，人们放声大哭……
    被救的青年女教师林爱花来了。“扑通”一声跪在烈士的母亲面前，声泪俱下：“是您的儿子给了我第二次生命，你们就是我的父母……。”
