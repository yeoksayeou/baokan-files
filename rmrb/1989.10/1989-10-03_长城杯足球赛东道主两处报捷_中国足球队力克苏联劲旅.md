China's national football team defeated the Soviet Black Sea team 2-1 tonight in the second round of the Great Wall Cup International Football Tournament.

This was the first international match held at the newly renovated Beijing Workers' Stadium in preparation for the Asian Games.

In the 16th minute of the second half, China's number 7, Xie Yuxin, shot from about 30 meters out, with a very tricky angle. The Soviet goalkeeper, Gorishko, misjudged the shot, and the ball sailed into the top corner of the net. Ten minutes later, Xie Yuxin pushed the ball to the front of the goal from the left side of the field, scoring with a small angle. Xie Yuxin celebrated with a forward roll on the ground. Thus, in the two matches of this Great Wall Cup, all four goals scored by the Chinese team were by Xie Yuxin.

The Soviet Black Sea team is currently ranked seventh in the Soviet top league. In the 18th minute of the second half, they utilized a long pass from midfield to the back, with number 10, Kondratyev, breaking through alone. Two Chinese defenders rushed back to defend, and the goalkeeper also attempted to block, but it was to no avail. Not only did they concede a goal, but Zhang Huikang also injured his right shoulder.

    长城杯足球赛东道主两处报捷
    中国足球队力克苏联劲旅
    本报北京10月1日讯　记者汪大昭报道：中国足球队今晚在长城杯国际足球锦标赛第二轮比赛中，以2∶1战胜苏联黑海人队。
    这是为迎接亚运会整修一新的北京工人体育场首次用于国际比赛。
    下半时第16分钟，中国队7号谢育新在离球门30米左右的地方突施冷箭，角度极刁。苏联队门将戈里什科判断失误，目送皮球挂入大门上角。过了10分钟，谢育新在左侧底线附近将球推到门前七八米远的地方，小角度攻门告成，喜得小谢就地一个前滚翻。这样，中国队在此次长城杯两场交锋的四个进球，全系谢育新一人之功。
    苏联黑海人队目前积分列全苏甲级队第七位。该队下半时第18分钟，利用中后场一记直长传，10号康德拉季耶夫单刀直入。中国队两员卫将急回救驾，门将亦扑出封堵，还是不解决问题，不仅丢失一分，张惠康还跌伤了右肩。
