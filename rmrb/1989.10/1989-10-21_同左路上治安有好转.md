On June 28th, the sixth edition of your newspaper published a reader's letter titled "Gangsters Rampant on the Tongzuo Road." Our bureau's leadership paid great attention to this issue and immediately organized a rectification campaign along the Tongzuo Road in the Datas section, involving 21 public security bureaus and police stations. A total of more than 70 cases were solved.

On July 2nd, a driver from Shuangwan in Zuoyun County was robbed of 30 yuan in cash by gangsters at a restaurant in Baimiao, Yungang Town. Upon receiving the report, our bureau's Criminal Investigation Department quickly coordinated with the Gaoshan Town Police Station and the Zhangjiawan Mine Public Security Bureau to solve the case. They uncovered a nine-person robbery gang and solved more than 20 cases of knife-wielding robberies.

Currently, we have apprehended more than 70 lawbreakers and dismantled 6 robbery gangs. Now, the public security situation along the Tongzuo Road has significantly improved.

　　同左路上治安有好转
    6月28日，你报第六版刊登了《同左路上歹徒猖獗》的读者来信后，我局领导十分重视，当即组织了同左公路大同段内沿线的21个公安科、派出所开展整顿工作，共破案70多起。
    7月2日，左云县店湾一司机在云岗镇白庙一饭店被歹徒抢走现金30元。我局刑侦处在接到报案后，立即会同高山镇派出所和张家湾矿公安科迅速侦破，还挖出一个9人抢劫团伙，破获持刀抢劫案20多起。
    目前，我们已经抓获了违法犯罪分子70多名，打击抢劫团伙6个。现在，同左公路沿线的治安秩序明显好转。
