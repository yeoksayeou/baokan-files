The men's and women's singles of the Asian Tennis Championship have completed two rounds. The People's Daily, Beijing, October 21st - Reporter Huang Zhenzhong reports: After the East Asian Tennis Team Championship concluded, the Asian Tennis Championship immediately began. Today, the men's and women's singles have completed two rounds, with South Korean, Japanese, and Chinese athletes performing well.

In the second round of the men's and women's singles, Chinese male athletes Meng Qianghua, Zhang Jiuhua, and Pan Bing, and female athletes Tang Min and Li Fang successfully advanced. In the men's doubles, Chinese athletes Pan Bing and Liu Shuhua, Zhang Jiuhua and Xia Jiaping, as well as Sun Zhiwei and Zhang Liwu passed the first round. In the women's doubles, Chinese athletes have been eliminated and lost their qualification for the finals. Due to the heavy exertion in the team competition, the athletes entered the individual events feeling somewhat fatigued, which has affected the performance of some, impacting their technical execution. It appears that Asian tennis players need to strengthen their physical training.

Because the East Asian Tennis Team Championship and the Asian Tennis Championship are scheduled closely together, the opening ceremony was only held today. A brief ceremony was conducted at the Beijing International Tennis Center.

　　亚洲网球锦标赛男女单打赛罢两轮
    本报北京10月21日电　记者黄振中报道：在东亚网球团体赛鸣金后，接着又开始了亚洲网球锦标赛，今天男女单打已赛罢两轮，南朝鲜、日本和中国选手成绩较好。
    中国男选手孟强华、张九华和潘兵、女选手唐敏、李芳在男女单打第二轮中顺利过关，男子双打中国选手潘兵、刘树华和张九华、夏加平以及孙志伟、张立武过了第一关。女子双打，中国选手已被淘汰，失去决赛资格。各队选手由于在团体赛中耗力较多，进入单项后显得有些疲劳，有的已影响到技术发挥，看来亚洲网球手要加强身体素质训练。
    由于东亚网球团体赛和亚洲网球锦标赛竞赛时间靠得很紧，比赛开幕式到今天才进行，在北京国际网球中心进行了简短的仪式。
