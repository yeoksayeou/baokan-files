Usually, we often talk about the "Yangtze River Delta" and the "Pearl River Delta," intentionally or unintentionally neglecting another place. In fact, the Yellow River also has a delta.

When you think of the Yellow River mouth, you imagine a vast expanse of yellow waves surging into the blue sea in an instant, a sharp divide between green and yellow. But when you enter the Yellow River mouth area, you find it's not so straightforward. From the edge, it's like entering a labyrinth, with waterways and marshes everywhere, and dense reeds and bushes. The ground is crisscrossed with roads, and in the distance, you see muddy rivers. To the left, you hear the hum of drilling rigs, and to the right, the cries of geese...

Riding in a sturdy blue "cruiser" jeep, you push forward with all your might, but it takes half a day to reach the actual mouth of the river. There aren't many paved roads, but the dirt roads are well-maintained, yet for some reason, the car bounces so much that it feels like you're about to be shaken into eight pieces. It's no exaggeration to say that it's like experiencing a mild concussion.

The map you brought is useless to an outsider, but your guide is a forty-year veteran of the Yellow River, who has known the Yellow River's temperament since the founding of the republic. Only in his old age did he finally understand the Yellow River's moods. Every time he reaches a crucial point, he calls for the car to stop, spreads out the map on the ground, and points and draws, explaining the significance of every dot and the mystery of every line. He is so engrossed that even his frosted eyebrows seem to move. No wonder they say that commanders who have fought many battles have an addiction, and those who fight against nature also have a craving.

The area is sparsely populated, but there are swarms of mosquitoes. It is said that in the summer and autumn nights, the blood-sucking experts from the grasslands, "accumulating small amounts into large ones," cause as much harm as highway robbers. But this does not deter the builders from coming here. On the drier highlands, you can still see rows of red-brick houses forming the rare villages of the Yellow River Delta. Many of the village names are "X Family House," probably because at first, there was a family of brave pioneers who dared to venture into the wilderness and settled here. The wind vane on the roof of that lonely house was a flag, beckoning later settlers to come.

Today, these pioneers' footholds have been left behind, and the front lines are where the fighters against silt and river are. The suction dredgers roar with their large nostrils, and you can see the silt being magically spun away. The bronze-faced heroes wield thick rubber hoses like elephant trunks, blasting powerful jets of water at the waist of the yellow mud, and in no time, a large pit appears...

This is the scientific practice of a new plan for controlling the Yellow River. In the past, controlling the Yellow River focused only on the middle and lower reaches, but now it has been discovered that working from the river mouth often achieves twice the result with half the effort. Dredging the river mouth, removing the blocking sand, and achieving "cutting off branches, drying up the river, returning to the correct path, and smoothing the mouth" reduces the risks and pressures in the middle and lower reaches.

Because 70% of the silt carried by the Yellow River deposits in the river mouth and shallow sea area, the river mouth shifts and changes course every ten years or so. However, the result of intensively managing the river mouth is that the duration of clear water flow is stably extended, and the normal exploration and development of the oil field are guaranteed.

The silt particles carried by the Yellow River are extremely fine and have a bright color. I picked up a handful and smelled it, and it had a faint, earthy fragrance. In fact, they are not "local residents" here but have migrated from thousands of miles away from the Loess Plateau and more than a thousand miles away from the Central Plains. They carry the fragrance of rice from the Yellow River Bend, the passion of the Hukou Waterfall, the antiquity of Bianjing, and the ruggedness of Caozhou. They are the milk of the ancestors of the Chinese nation and the sweat of today's reformers...

I couldn't bear to throw away this handful of soil and brought it back as a base for planting flowers.

At this point, looking to the east-southeast, the round, bulging water bay shimmers with golden grains under the sunlight. This is the true mouth of the Yellow River, or more precisely, the place where the Yellow River enters the sea. Where is the mouth? Where is the line? In fact, the river is the sea, and the sea is the river. The sky is water, and the water is the sky. Boats dot the horizon, swaying gently, and the vast expanse of water stretches out before you.

But it's strange, just two miles away from what is temporarily called the sea, there are still vast fields of crops. The red-tasseled sorghum, like a broom, sweeps through the already clean air. It seems there are owners, because in the fields, there are camouflaged people in purple jackets scaring birds, but no birds come to eat the crops. Instead, a large water bird, like a heron, emerges from a nearby water puddle in the fields, carrying a fat fish in its beak, and swallows it proudly, as if deliberately provoking us, the unwelcome guests whose stomachs are already growling. It seems to say: The Yellow River Delta is rich in resources!

On our way back, we deliberately took a detour, following the guide levee all the way. This stone-built levee has the oil field inside and the Bohai Sea outside.

The road on the guide levee is flat and wide, and as clean as a whistle. Driving on it, there is no more bouncing. The builders here, looking to the future, revealed to me: The era of comprehensive development of the Yellow River Delta, ending the situation of "river without navigation, mouth without port, oil without factory," is about to come.

    古河口，新三角洲
    石英
    通常我们多说“长江三角洲”“珠江三角洲”，有意无意地冷落了一个地方，其实黄河口也有三角洲呢。
    一提起黄河口，想象中也是万里黄涛，在一瞬间涌入蓝色的海洋，一刀横切，青黄森然；当它入了黄河口区，才知并非如此干脆利落。从接近它的边缘开始，就像进入了八卦阵，四下里看去，到处是沟汊水泊，满眼是灌木苇丛；脚下是道路纵横，远方又见河道浊流；左耳间探井机鸣，右耳畔雁叫声声……乘坐耐摔打的蓝色“巡洋舰”汽车，奋力开去，小半天还没到达真正的入海口。没有多少水泥公路，但土道的路面也铲得很平，却不知为何，汽车跑起来，颠得人好像要摔成八瓣；毫不夸张的说，也赶得上一次轻微脑震荡。
    随身带的地图，外行人也还是睁眼瞎，向导是四十年的老黄河，从共和国诞生时就“摸着黄河的脾气”长大，直到上了年纪，才把黄河老祖宗的脾气摸透了七八。他每到一个关键所在，便叫停车，就地摊开地图，指指划划，每一个点点都有名堂，每一条线线都有奥妙。那样子，很入迷，连染霜的眉毛都在动。怪不得以前说打惯了仗的指挥员有瘾，跟大自然开仗的指挥员也有瘾头。
    这里人烟稀少，蚊蚋倒是成堆。据说夏秋夜里来到这里，从草丛里窜出来的吸血专家“积小成多”，为害之烈不亚于拦路打劫的强盗。但这也不足以阻止建设者前来，在干燥些的高阜上，还可见一排排红砖平房，组成了黄河三角洲上稀有的村庄。这里的庄名，不少称为“X家屋子”，想必是起初有一家胆敢深入荒域的勇者，率先来此扎根，那孤独小屋顶上的风风转儿就是旗帜，召唤着后继者前来。
    今天，这些勇者的立足地却被抛在后边，前沿阵地上才是与泥沙淤河作战的斗士。吸泥机大鼻孔噗噗地吼着，眼瞅着那淤泥被神奇地旋走了；古铜色面孔的健儿们手中的粗大胶管如同象鼻子，把威力强大的水柱打在黄泥腰心部位，一会儿就是一个大坑……
    这是新的治黄方案的科学实践，往昔治黄只着眼于中游和下游，而今发现：从河口处下工夫往往可收事半功倍之效。疏浚河口，排除拦门沙，达到“截支疏干，治乱归一，河归正道，口门通顺”，从而减小了中下游的险情和压力。
    由于黄水带下的泥沙70％堆积在河口和浅海区，以致每十年左右入海口就左右摆动改道一次，而下大力气治理河口的结果，便使清流的行水年限稳定延长，而且保证了油田的正常勘探与开发。
    被冲流而下的黄土颗粒极细，颜色很鲜，我捧在手中闻了闻，有一种腐殖的清香气。其实，它们不是此处的“坐地户”，而是从数千里外的黄土高原和千余里之遥的中原大地远徙而来。它们带着河套的稻香，壶口的激情，汴京的古朴，曹州的粗犷，它们是华夏始祖的乳汁和当今改革者的汗水交融而成的产物……我舍不得扔掉这捧土，将它带回来，作为植花盆底的铺垫。
    此时再向东南望去，那圆鼓鼓的水湾泛着金粒，在阳光下闪闪烁烁。这才是真正的黄水入海口，不，只能更确切地称它黄河入海处。哪里有口？哪里有线？其实河也是海，海也是河，天也是水，水也是天。船帆点点，袅袅娜娜，烟波浩渺。
    但也怪哩，仅距权且称为海的边缘二里之遥，还有成片成片的庄稼，那红缨穗的高粱，如拂尘在掸着本够清爽的空间。看来也有主人，因为田间有伪装的穿紫花褂儿的赶鸟“人”，却没见有鸟儿来吃庄稼；倒是发现有一只鹭鸶模样的大水鸟，就从庄稼地近前的水泡子里，衔出一条肥大的鱼，得意地吞进肚里，像在故意气我们这些腹中已经叫苦的不速之客；似乎说：黄河三角洲物产丰富着哩！
    回来我们有意绕了个弯子，沿着导流堤一路走去。这石筑的堤防，里边是油田，外面是渤海。
    这导流堤上的路面，平展宽阔，其净如洗，车行于上，再无那番颠簸。此地的建设者展望前景，向我透露：结束“有河无航，有口无港，有油无厂”的综合开发黄河三角洲的时代就要来到了。
