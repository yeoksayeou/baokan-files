Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, held a discussion today with 21 young scientists who have made outstanding contributions to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He said that young scientists must root themselves in the soil of their motherland and work diligently to achieve success and become the successors of China's scientific cause.

The participants in the discussion were the first batch of recipients of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Young Scientist Award. The youngest among them is 26 years old, and most are in their 30s. Many of them have studied abroad. They are determined to start their careers in China and have achieved a series of research results that have attracted attention both domestically and internationally. Sheng Chengfa, a young scientist from the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in his speech, "I am the son of a farmer. The Party and the people have nurtured me into a Ph.D. Working abroad, I can earn a lot of dollars every month. However, our country is not yet very wealthy. How can I alone enjoy the comforts abroad! I believe: my career is in my motherland, and this is unshakable." Li Xianhua, a 28-year-old young scientist from the Institute of Geochemistry in Guiyang, said, "We should strengthen education on hard work among young people. Now this aspect is mentioned less. I hope that in scientific research, more responsibilities are given to young people, and young people should also have a sense of mission to bring glory to the motherland."

Jiang Zemin affirmed the achievements of the young scientists at the meeting. He said, "Last night I read your biographies, and today I listened to your speeches, which made me truly feel that you are the hope of the motherland and the dawn of China's future. Many of the older scientists present returned to the motherland after hearing about the founding of New China, dedicating themselves to the motherland. You young scientists are the same, returning to the motherland and devoting your knowledge to the construction of the motherland. This shows that both old and young scientists share a common ideal: our roots are in China, and we want to revitalize and develop our China."

Jiang Zemin said, "Your research achievements are the result of hard work. Engaging in natural science research requires a down-to-earth and realistic spirit. He encouraged young scientists to set high ideals, and young people's active thinking in scientific research can shine brightly in the scientific community. He hoped that everyone would contribute their wisdom in their golden years to the development of China's science and technology."

Jiang Zemin also pointed out during the discussion that in today's fierce international competition, the most important thing is to look at comprehensive national strength, and one of the most important aspects of this is the progress and development of science and technology. He said, "Scientific research should serve and be combined with the aspects that have the greatest impact on the development of the national economy, but it should also have a long-term vision. Science and technology must have reserves and be strengthened in basic research, and the results should ultimately be applied in economic development."

After the discussion, Jiang Zemin, accompanied by Song Jian, Lu Jiashi, Zhou Guangzhao, and others, visited the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider located at the High Energy Physics Research Institute and listened to an introduction to the operation of the collider.

    江泽民同中科院获奖青年科学家座谈时说
    植根祖国大地才能有所成就
    鼓励青年科技人员树立远大理想在科学界大放光芒
    新华社北京10月6日电　（记者张继民）中共中央总书记江泽民今天在中国科学院高能物理研究所，同科学院有突出贡献的21名青年科学家进行了座谈。他说，青年科技工作者只有植根在祖国的大地上，扎扎实实地去工作，才能有所成就，成为祖国科学事业的接班人。
    参加座谈的是中国科学院青年科学家奖首批获奖人员。他们当中最年轻的26岁，多数在30岁左右，许多在国外留学过，他们立志在国内创业，取得了一系列国内外瞩目的科研成果。中科院动物所青年科学家盛承发在发言中说，我是农民的儿子，是党和人民把我培养成为博士。在国外工作，我每月可以拿到很多美元。可是，我们国家还不太富裕，我怎能一个人在国外贪图享受！我认为：我的事业在祖国，这是坚定不移的。年仅28岁的中科院贵阳地球化学所的李献华说，应该在青年中加强艰苦奋斗的教育，现在这方面提的少了。他希望在科研中多给青年压担子，青年人也要有使命感，为祖国争光。
    江泽民在会上肯定了青年科学家所取得的成就。他说，昨天晚上我看了你们的事迹材料，今天又听了你们的发言，使我真切地感到，你们是祖国的希望所在，是中国未来的曙光。在座的许多老科学家，当年一听说新中国成立，就飘洋过海，返回祖国，献身祖国，你们青年科学家也是这样，回国后，一心把学到的知识献给祖国的建设事业。这说明，新老科学家都有一个共同的理想：我们的根在中国，要振兴和发展我们的中国。
    江泽民说，你们的科研成就是靠一点一滴的辛勤劳动取得的，从事自然科学研究就是要有扎扎实实的求实精神。他鼓励青年科技人员要树立远大理想，青年人从事科研的思路活跃，在科学界是可以大放光芒的。希望大家在自己的黄金时代为祖国科学技术的发展贡献聪明才智。
    江泽民同志在座谈中还指出，在当今激烈的国际竞争中，重要的是要看综合国力，而其中最重要的一个方面是科学技术的进步和发展。他说，科学研究当然要服务和结合于对国民经济发展最有影响的方面，但也要有长远眼光，科学技术一定要有后劲、有储备，对基础研究也要加强、并使成果最终在经济发展中得到应用。
    座谈会后，江泽民在宋健、卢嘉锡、周光召等陪同下，参观了设在高能所的北京正负电子对撞机，听取了对撞机运转情况的介绍。
