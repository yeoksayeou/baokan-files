Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 21st.

According to reports from Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers, some individuals who fled abroad after orchestrating and directing the Beijing turmoil have openly revealed their relations with Taiwan. Some of them are scheduled to visit Taiwan next month.

Reports indicate that the reactionary organization "All-American Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars for Self-Governance" ("All-American Federation of Students for Self-Governance") recently issued a statement praising Taiwan for its "great support" for the so-called "democratic movement" in Beijing. This organization plans to send representatives to Taiwan on November 15th to "increase understanding and foster friendship." Among those preparing to visit Taiwan are Li Lu ("Deputy Commander of the Tiananmen Square Command Center"), Zhang Rui ("Director of the Tiananmen Square Student Broadcasting Station"), and Liu Yongchuan ("Chairman of the All-American Federation of Students for Self-Governance").

Another report states that leaders of the reactionary organization "Democratic China Front" who fled abroad will also visit Taiwan. Among the possible members of the "Taiwan Visit Delegation" being organized by Wan Runnan are Yan Jiaqi, Wu'erkaixi, Wan Runnan, and Su Xiaokang.

These defectors' praise for Taiwan is also becoming public. Recently, in a speech in the United States, Su Shaozhi, while attacking Marxism, once again advocated for "political pluralism" and praised Taiwan's "democratization," claiming that Taiwan's "democratization process" is "more feasible in the mainland in the future." Chen Yizi, in a thematic lecture, also extensively discussed how "the Three Principles of the People are a reasonable system."

　　叛逃国外动乱分子与台湾关系公开化
　　有些人下月将赴台活动
    新华社北京10月21日电　据港台报纸报道，策划、指挥北京动乱现叛逃在外的一些人同台湾的关系正在公开化。有些人下个月将到台湾活动。
    据报道，反动组织“全美中国留学生、学者自治联合会”（“全美学自联”）最近发表声明称颂台湾对北京这次所谓的“民运”“给予了极大的支持”，这个组织下月15日将派人到台湾去，目的是“增加了解，增进友谊”。准备到台湾活动的人中有参与策划、组织此次北京动乱的李录（“天安门广场指挥部副总指挥”）、张锐（“天安门广场学生广播站站长”），以及“全美学自联”的“主席”刘永川等。
    另据报道，叛逃在外的反动组织“民主中国阵线”的头头也将去台湾活动。严家其、吾尔开希、万润南、苏晓康都是正由万润南筹组中的“访台代表团”成员的可能人选。到台湾活动的时间预定在今年年底台湾进行“县、市长”选举之后。
    这些叛国外逃分子对台湾的吹捧也在公开化。苏绍智最近在美国的一次演说中，就在攻击马克思主义的同时再次鼓吹“政治的多元化”，并吹捧台湾的“民主化”，声称台湾的“民主化过程”“未来在大陆上比较可行”。陈一谘在一次专题讲演中也大谈什么“三民主义是有道理的制度”。
