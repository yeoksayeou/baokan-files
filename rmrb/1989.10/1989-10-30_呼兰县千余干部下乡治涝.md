Over a thousand officials from Hulan County, a national model county for water conservancy projects in Heilongjiang Province, recently went to the countryside to work with farmers on large-scale agricultural water conservancy projects, focusing on controlling flooding.

In Hulan County, 800,000 mu (approximately 53,333 hectares) of the 2.2 million mu (approximately 146,667 hectares) of cultivated land are low-lying and prone to flooding. Early this year, the county committee and government invested 34 million yuan to comprehensively develop the flood-prone areas, focusing on controlling flooding, and have already "liberated" 300,000 mu (approximately 20,000 hectares) of low-lying, flood-prone land. To ensure that grain production reaches new heights next year, 30,000 farmers will once again advance into the flood-prone areas in October.

　　呼兰县千余干部下乡治涝
    本报讯　全国水利建设先进县——黑龙江省呼兰县的一千多名机关干部，前不久下乡同农民一起大搞以治涝为重点的农田水利基本建设。
    在呼兰县二百二十多万亩耕地中，低洼易涝地占了八十万亩。今年初，县委、县政府集资三千四百多万元，以治涝为重点综合开发涝区，已使三十万亩低洼易涝地获得“解放”。为保证明年粮食登上新台阶，三万农民十月份再次进军涝区。
