	Ticket Price Adjustment Implemented Smoothly
	Railway, Civil Aviation, and Waterway Transportation Orders Maintained; Passengers Reflect Improved Service Quality

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 18th — (Reporter Li Mei) Since the ticket price adjustment over a month ago, the transportation orders of railways, civil aviation, and waterways have been maintained smoothly. Passengers generally reflect that the service quality has improved.

	According to data provided by the Ministry of Communications, the direct-affiliated shipping enterprises completed a passenger volume of 2.41 million in September, a 21.1% decrease compared to the same period last year. However, passenger flow on routes such as Shanghai to Wenzhou and Dalian to Yantai remains high. The railway department reports that from September to the present, the daily passenger volume has been maintained at around 2.5 to 2.6 million, a decrease of 70 to 80 thousand people compared to the same period last year. The passenger flow of civil aviation has not fluctuated significantly due to the continued implementation of discounted prices on major routes.

	Another phenomenon after the ticket price adjustment is that the passenger flow on highways in provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang has increased significantly. The transportation departments have taken timely measures, and there have been no instances of passenger congestion in various places. According to passengers, after the ticket price adjustment, the hygiene and service quality of trains and ships have improved significantly, and the punctuality rate has also greatly increased. Tickets for trains and ships are also easier to purchase than before.

	The railway and waterway departments have seized the opportunity of reduced passenger flow to make timely adjustments and strengthen cargo transportation. The railway coal transportation in the first decade of October reached a historical high, with an average of 30,558 cars loaded per day. Other key materials such as grain, timber, and ores have also exceeded their planned targets.

    客票调价实施顺利
    铁路民航水路运输秩序井然  旅客反映服务质量有所提高
    新华社北京10月18日电　（记者李玫）客票调价1个多月以来，铁路、民航、水路各部门运输秩序井然。旅客们反映服务质量普遍有所提高。
    据交通部提供的数字，部直属航运企业9月份完成客运量241万余人次，比去年同期下降21.1％，但上海—温州、大连—烟台等航线客流仍然饱满。铁路部门则反映，9月份至今日发送旅客量均保持在250—260万左右，比去年同期每天减少70—80万人。民航的客流量因主要热线仍实行优惠价，波动始终不大。
    客票调价后的另一个现象是山东、河南、江苏、江西、安徽、浙江等省的公路客流量有较大增加。交通部门及时采取措施，各地都没有出现旅客积压的现象。据旅客们反映，客票调价后，列车、轮船的卫生、服务质量有较大改善，正点率也大大提高。车票、船票也比过去好买多了。
    铁路、水运部门抓住客流减少的有利时机，及时调整，加强了货物运输。铁路煤炭运输10月上旬创历史最好水平，日均装车达30558车。其他重点物资如粮食、木材、矿石等也都超额完成计划。
