In a situation where construction investment is tight, the Tianjin Municipal Government continues to carry out housing system reforms and explores the commercialization of housing. The Shuanhuan Village community and other 500,000 square meters of affordable commercial housing were completed for National Day, and more than 5,800 households with the most difficult housing conditions have moved into their new homes.

Having a place to live is still the most urgent need in the lives of urban residents. Located on the north bank of the Tianjin North Canal, the Shuanhuan Village community, with a residential building area of 150,000 square meters, is refreshing. These affordable commercial houses have four types of rooms: single-story and small two-story buildings, each with two types. The area of each room is more than 13 square meters, the kitchen is more than 6 square meters, and there is a 6-square-meter family courtyard. Recently, the worker Liang Jixia from the Power Machinery Factory bought this single-story house for only 4,808.89 yuan. Although it does not have a family bathroom, the community's water, electricity, roads, drainage, public transportation, and other supporting facilities are complete. Stores, schools, kindergartens, medical facilities, and public toilets are all well-equipped. The relevant departments are urgently planting trees to form a forest.

This type of affordable commercial housing, which is largely supported by the government, with enterprises providing some support, and workers only needing to pay for a refrigerator and a color TV to obtain ownership, has helped those with the most difficult housing conditions, such as those with less than 2.5 square meters of living space per person, those who are married but have no housing, and those who have large families sharing a single room. The 500,000 square meters of affordable housing has been snapped up by 20,000 households. Those who lack money can pool resources with their parents and brothers to buy it.

The general engineer of the Tianjin Affordable Commercial Housing Construction Command, Zhang Shiqing, told the reporter that Tianjin's 500,000 square meters of similar housing in four large areas will be completed this year with the speed of planning, raising funds, land acquisition, earthwork, design, construction, and supporting facilities all completed in the same year. All will be handed over for use by the end of this year.

    房改有进展　居民买得起
    天津廉价商品房受欢迎
    本报天津10月9日电　记者肖荻报道：在基建投资偏紧的情况下，天津市政府继续进行住房制度改革，推行住宅商品化的探索。双环村小区等50万平方米廉价商品房国庆竣工，5800多个住房最困难户陆续迁进新居。
    居者有其屋，仍是当前城市群众生活中最急迫的需求。位于天津北运河畔、住宅建筑面积达15万平方米的双环村小区，使人耳目一新。这些廉价商品房有4种房型，平房和小二楼各两种，每种居室面积均在13平方米以上，厨房6平方米以上，并附6平方米家庭小院。新近迁入的动力机厂职工梁继霞购买这套平房，仅花了4808.89元。虽不具备家庭卫生间，但小区内水、电、路、排水、公共交通等各项配套功能齐全，商店、学校、幼儿园、医疗、公厕等生活服务设施完善，有关部门正抓紧冬季植树围以丛林。
    由政府大配套、企业小配套、职工个人仅花个冰箱、彩电钱即可购得产权的这种廉价商品房，为居住面积人均不足2.5平方米、婚后无房、大子女同一室等住房最困难户救了急。50万平方米廉价房，被两万户职工一抢而光。缺点钱的，父母兄弟一凑也就买了。
    该市廉价商品房建设指挥部章世清总工程师告诉记者，天津50万平方米、4大片同类房屋，都将以当年规划、集资，当年征地、垫土，当年设计、施工，当年配套完成的速度，于今年底全部交付使用。
