The "Jidip" Sets Sail Again: China's Sixth Antarctic Expedition Departs

A 138-person team comprising China's sixth Antarctic expedition set sail from Qingdao's North Sea Shipyard at 4 PM today aboard the "Jidip" research vessel, embarking on a voyage across the Pacific Ocean.

The expedition team includes 39 members bound for Changcheng Station and 60 members for Zhongshan Station. It is understood that the "Jidip" will first head to Changcheng Station via Chile's Valparaiso Port, then circumnavigate the Antarctic continent from west to east along the 62nd parallel south to reach Zhongshan Station.

China's sixth Antarctic expedition has the following tasks: the Changcheng Station team will primarily conduct scientific research, including routine projects such as geomagnetism, meteorology, and high-altitude atmospheric physics, as well as investigations into intertidal ecosystem, human physiological research, and studies on environmental changes over the past 10,000 years. The Zhongshan Station team will mainly complete the second phase of construction at Zhongshan Station, including the construction of the science building, cultural and sports warehouse, and the installation of the satellite system. They will also focus on comprehensive ground, air, and space observations during the 22nd solar maximum year, and research and survey biological resources in the Prydz Bay area. The expedition will leave 20 members at Zhongshan Station to overwinter.

It is reported that the total voyage distance for this expedition is 24,486.9 nautical miles, with an estimated voyage time of 1,828 hours. The expedition is expected to return to Qingdao on April 5, 1990.

Two Japanese scientists, two Pakistani scientists, and one Colombian biologist will also participate in this expedition.

To withstand the impact of waves, the "Jidip" was equipped with a new anti-roll device last year, which can reduce the roll by 50%.

　　“极地”号再次起航
　　我第六次南极考察队出发
    据新华社青岛10月30日电  （记者刘海民）由138人组成的中国第六次南极考察队，今天下午4点乘坐“极地”号考察船驶离青岛北海船厂码头，开始了横跨太平洋的航行。
    考察队包括39名长城站队员和60名中山站队员。据了解，
  “极地”号将经智利瓦尔帕莱索港到长城站，然后环南极大陆由西向东沿南纬62度左右驶往中山站。
    中国第六次南极考察队担负的任务是：长城站考察队以科学考察为主，除常规项目如地磁、气象、高空大气物理等外，还将进行潮间带生态系的调查，人体生理学研究，一万年环境变迁的研究等；中山站考察队以完成中山站二期工程建设为主，计划完成科研栋、文体仓库栋以及卫星系统的安装等，并重点进行22周太阳峰年日，地、空综合观测，普里兹海域的生物资源等项目的研究考察。考察队还将在中山站留下20名队员越冬。
    据介绍，这次考察在海上的总航程为24486.9海里，航时需要1828小时。预计在1990年4月5日返回青岛。
    2名日本科学家、2名巴基斯坦科学家及1名哥伦比亚生物科学家也将参加此次考察。
    为抵御风浪的冲击，“极地”号船上去年新装了减摇装置，可以减少50％的摇晃度。
