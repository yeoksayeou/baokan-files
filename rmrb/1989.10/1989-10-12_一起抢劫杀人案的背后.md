On the night of August 24, in a small town near Naples, Italy, 30 black youths were crowded together sleeping in a dilapidated house. To make a living, they had traveled thousands of miles from Kenya, Zambia, Sudan, and other countries to work here. They never imagined that a calamity was about to befall them.

The shout, "Dirty black devils, hand over your money!" woke them from their sleep. In the dim light, they saw five menacing figures with covered faces. The dark muzzles of guns pointed at them, and they had no choice but to hand over the little money they had saved. A South African youth tried to escape but was shot down by the thugs, while two of his companions were also injured by bullets.

What happened in this Italian small town is but a microcosm of the plight of black immigrants in Western Europe. With the recent rise of far-right forces in Western Europe, racial discrimination and xenophobia have been on the increase, and crimes against foreign immigrants occur frequently. Recently, in the Alps region of France, a 23-year-old Tunisian youth was stabbed to death in a quarrel. In Switzerland, new Nazi organizations such as the "Patriotic Front," "New European Order," and "National Party" have emerged one after another. They shout, "Faced with the fatal threat that Africans and Asians pose to whites, Europeans, and Switzerland, we must fight to defend our ancestors' heritage." The "Patriotic Front" explicitly advocates expelling all non-European immigrants and banning communist and left-wing organizations. To exploit the latent xenophobia in people's minds, they also propose the slogans "Fatherland, Order, Tradition" to mislead the public.

Although the rise of these far-right forces and xenophobic sentiments is only the work of a minority, their development trend has already aroused concern. A Swiss journalist believes that since the end of World War II, Switzerland has never seen so many neo-Nazi elements as it does now. Currently, the Swiss Federal Government is preparing to submit a draft bill to the parliament this autumn to amend the criminal law, aiming to better punish acts of racial discrimination. In Italy, many intellectuals have also stood up to call on the whole society to fight against racist behavior. Recently, the official newspaper of the Italian Communist Party proposed establishing an organization similar to France's anti-racism organization, which has received the support of many intellectuals. The Italian State Secretary in charge of social affairs also advocates enacting new legislation and conducting propaganda on television to make people understand: blacks are also human.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. People should especially reflect deeply on history and be sufficiently alert to the rise of right-wing forces in Western Europe and the spread of racial discrimination sentiments. Only in this way can we avoid the repetition of the historical tragedy of inhuman racial slaughter that occurred during World War II.

    一起抢劫杀人案的背后
    姚立
    8月24日夜，意大利那不勒斯附近的一个小镇里，30个黑人青年正拥挤着睡在一间破旧不堪的房子里。为了谋生，他们从肯尼亚、赞比亚、苏丹等国千里迢迢来此打工。他们连做梦也没有想到，一场厄运即将来临。
      “臭黑鬼，把钱交出来”的喊声将他们从睡梦中惊醒，朦胧中看到的是5个凶神恶煞般的蒙面人。黑幽幽的枪口对着他们，他们只得把积攒下来的一点血汗钱交出。一个南非青年想要逃跑，却被暴徒们的子弹击倒，另外两个伙伴也中弹负伤。
    这个意大利小镇发生的事情不过是西欧黑人移民境遇的一个缩影。随着近年来西欧极右势力的抬头，种族歧视和排外情绪有增无已，针对外国移民的犯罪案件时有发生。不久前，在法国阿尔卑斯山地区，一个23岁的突尼斯青年在一次口角中被人用刀刺死；在瑞士，诸如“爱国阵线”、“欧洲新秩序”、“民族党”等一些新纳粹组织不断出现，他们叫嚣：“面对非洲人和亚洲人入侵给白人、欧洲和瑞士带来的致命威胁，我们要为捍卫祖先的遗产而斗争。”“爱国阵线”明确主张，要驱逐一切非欧洲移民，取缔共产党及左派组织。为利用人们头脑中潜在的排外情绪，他们还提出“祖国、秩序、传统”的口号，蛊惑人心。
    这股极右势力和排外思潮的出现虽只是少数人所为，但它的发展趋势已引起人们的警惕。瑞士一位记者认为，二次大战以来，瑞士从未出现过现在这样多的新纳粹分子。目前，瑞士联邦政府正准备在今秋提交议会一份修改刑法的草案，以更好地惩治种族歧视的行径。在意大利，不少知识分子也挺身而出，呼吁全社会同种族主义的行为作斗争。不久前，意大利共产党机关报提议建立一类似法国的反种族歧视组织，并得到了不少知识分子的拥护。意大利负责社会事务的国务秘书也主张制定新的立法，在电视中开展宣传，以使人们明白：黑人也是人。
    今年是二次世界大战爆发50周年，人们尤其应当对历史进行深刻反思，对当前西欧右派势力的抬头和种族歧视思潮的蔓延给予足够的警惕。只有这样，才能避免二次大战期间灭绝人性的种族杀戮的历史悲剧重演。
