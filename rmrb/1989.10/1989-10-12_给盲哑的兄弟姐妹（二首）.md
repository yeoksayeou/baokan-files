	For My Blind and Deaf Brothers and Sisters
	(Two Poems)
	Zhang Xue Mei

	Black Fantasy

	The evening when the pear blossoms turn white,
	The sunset on the mountain edge becomes
	The last color in your eyes.
	The tilted space,
	You do not want to be a ruin.
	In the bustling crowd,
	You bravely extend your hands
	And cup the slivers of sunlight through the cracks.
	Thus,
	In the season of withered trees,
	You bloom with a tree full of glory.
	Do you know?
	Just that reed is blown over by the season again,
	My heart trembles once more.
	Do you know?
	For this,
	I have been blank for many years.
	My language
	Is the ashes of a burning rose,
	Carried away by the wind,
	Without a single glance back at me,
	Difficult to hold on to.
	I understand that you are waiting for me
	From a very distant place,
	Silently moved by every one of my gestures,
	And in the next station I am about to reach,
	You have booked a ticket for me.
	What should I say to you?
	Although in the years of inability to express,
	I am very lonely,
	But I still have to
	Wait for the season to communicate with people.

    给盲哑的兄弟姐妹
    （二首）
    张雪梅
    黑色幻想
    梨花染白的傍晚
    山边的夕阳成为你眼底
    最后的色彩
    倾斜的空间
    你不愿做一个废墟
    在忙碌的人群中
    你勇敢地伸出双手
    捧住缝隙中的缕缕阳光
    于是
    万木凋零的时节
    你开满了一树的辉煌
    你知道吗？
    仅仅是那片芦苇再次
    被季节吹过
    我的心再次惊悸
    你知道吗
    为了这个
    我已经空白了很多年
    我的语言
    是玫瑰花
    燃烧后的一堆灰烬
    随风而去
    没有回头看我一眼
    难以挽留
    我明白你在很远的地方
    等着我
    为着我的每一个手势
    默默地感动
    并且在我即将抵达的下一站
    预订了车票
    我该向你说些什么呢
    尽管在无法表达的岁月里
    我很寂寞
    但我还要
    等待与人们交流的季节
