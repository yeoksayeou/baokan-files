A chain of technical vice-directors, vice-mayors, vice-township heads, and vice-village heads from top to bottom has formed the command system for scientific and technological development in the Nanyang region of Henan Province. Currently, the leadership bodies at the prefecture, county, and township levels in Nanyang have all been fully staffed with technical vice-directors, and 80% of the villages have appointed technical vice-village heads.

Nanyang, located in the Dabie Mountains, has clearly established the following guiding ideology in implementing the strategy of promoting economic development through science and technology: whether various decisions can truly play a role depends on whether there are people to deploy, organize activities, arrange people, implement measures, coordinate problems, and supervise finances and materials. To improve this system, it is not only necessary to assign technical cadres to the prefecture and county levels but also to assign them to each township and village, forming a complete decision-making layer, command layer, and operational layer from top to bottom.

Most of the technical vice-directors at the prefecture, county, and township levels in Nanyang are recruited from technical management personnel in colleges and universities and research institutions. The technical vice-village heads at the village level are mainly selected from agricultural machinery stations, seed stations, and other service units, as well as from young people in the villages who have cultural knowledge and technical skills. To ensure that technical vice-directors have the authority to perform their duties, the regional committee and the regional government have formulated relevant policies. These technical cadres who have taken up leadership positions have played an active role in internal technological development, external talent introduction, technological cooperation, and specific decision-making implementation. For example, Wangdian Township in Neixiang County was once one of the poorest townships in the county. Two years ago, after Zhang Quanyi, a technical cadre, was appointed as the vice-township head for science and technology, he conducted a thorough investigation and research throughout the township based on the overall plans formulated by the region and the county. He identified the root cause of the past blind planting without considering soil conditions and provided the township party committee and government with a plan to adjust the planting structure: "Plant peanuts in Donggang and trees in Xigang, and grow grains and vegetables along the roadsides." The township party committee and government immediately organized the implementation, and the village technical vice-village heads provided specific guidance to each household. The following year, the township's income increased by 2.3 million yuan.

Many technical personnel, after taking up the position of technical vice-directors, also leveraged the scientific and technological strength of their original units and systems to introduce a large number of technical personnel. Statistics show that since last year, technical vice-directors at all levels have introduced more than 1,000 long-term or temporary talents to Nanyang and developed more than 3,000 projects, large and small. The cadres and masses of Nanyang have deeply felt that "it is better to send technical cadres than to give money and materials."

　　“国家给钱给物  不如选派科技干部”
　　南阳地县乡配齐科技副职
　　推动了科技开发人才引进和技术联合
    本报南阳10月21日电　以科技副专员、副县长、副乡长、副村长上下贯通的一条专线，形成了河南省南阳地区科技发展的指挥体系。目前，南阳的地、县、乡3级领导机构已全部配齐了科技副职，80％的村配备了科技副村长。
    地处大别山区的南阳地区，在实施以科技促经济的战略中，明确这样一条指导思想：各项决策能否真正发挥作用，关键在于部署有人组织，活动有人安排，措施有人落实，问题有人协调，财物有人督办。要完善这样一个系统，不仅要把科技干部配备在地县两级，而且要配备到各个乡、村，自上而下形成一个完整的决策层、指挥层和执行操作层。
    南阳地、县、乡3级科技副职大部分聘自大专院校和科研单位的技术管理人员，村一级的科技副职则主要从农机站、种子站等服务单位和村里有文化、懂技术的青年中选聘。为保证科技副职有职有权，地委和行署制定了有关政策。这些走上领导岗位的各级科技干部，在对内搞好科技开发，对外引进人才、技术联合和实施具体决策中，起到了积极作用。内乡县王店乡原是全县落后乡。前年，科技干部张全义被聘任科技副乡长后，根据地区、县里制定的总体规划，深入全乡调查研究，找到了过去不顾土壤条件盲目种植的病因，向乡党委、政府提供了一份“东岗花生西岗树，粮菜种在路两边”的调整种植结构方案。乡党委、政府马上组织落实，各村科技副村长对各农户进行具体指导，第2年就使全乡增收230万元。
    许多科技人员任科技副职后，还借助原单位和系统的科技力量，引进大批技术人员。据统计，各级科技副职自去年以来，为南阳引进长住或流动人才1000多人次，开发大小项目3000多个。南阳的干部群众深有感触说：“国家给钱给物，不如选派科技干部。”
