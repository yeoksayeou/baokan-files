Title: Transforming Restrictions into Support

The severe lag in transportation is fundamentally due to the emphasis on immediate and direct economic benefits, while the transportation industry, which is a foundational sector, has actually been subject to restrictive rather than supportive policies. This is evident in the following ways:

Firstly, investment in transportation has been both limited and decreasing in proportion. From 1953 to 1986, transportation infrastructure investment accounted for only 14.4% of the national total (the World Bank suggests that developing countries should allocate 20-28%). Within this period, the proportion was 15.3% from 1953 to 1978, but it dropped to 13.4% from 1979 to 1988.

Secondly, China's low freight rates have remained unchanged for decades, while the prices of materials needed by the transportation industry have been rising continuously. This creates a situation of low income against high expenditure, making self-accumulation and self-development impossible.

Thirdly, there are numerous issues with taxation, financial, and credit policies. Notably, the energy and transportation fund, collected under the guise of supporting transportation energy, is actually part of the state's fiscal revenue and is not used for its intended purpose.

Currently, approximately 20% of freight transportation is short-distance, within 100 kilometers, which does not leverage the advantages of railways in handling long-distance, heavy loads. Additionally, railways annually transport several hundred million tons of refined oil, failing to utilize the bidirectional transportation advantage of railways. Such transportation can be shifted to roads and pipelines, allowing railways to allocate the freed-up capacity to long-distance transportation of coal and other materials, thereby alleviating the tension in energy transportation. This adjustment in transportation structure can achieve greater transportation capacity and higher social and economic benefits under the same investment conditions. This is a correct policy officially issued by the state and should be implemented with seriousness.

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面——交通运输问题讨论

    变限制为扶持
    国家科委科技促进发展研究中心副理事长　金履忠
    交通运输严重滞后，根本原因在于只重视眼前的直接的经济效益；对交通这个基础产业实际上采取的不是扶持而是限制政策。表现在：第一，对交通投资既少，比例又不断下降。从1953至1986年交通业基建投资只占全国的14.4％
  （世界银行认为发展中国家应占到20—28％），其中1953至1978年为15.3％，1979至1988年反而降至13.4％。第二，我国低运价政策几十年不变，但交通业所需的物资价格却不断上涨，形成低收入对高支出，谈不到自我积累、自我发展了。第三，税收、金融、信贷政策有不少问题，突出的是以扶持交通能源名义征收的能源交通基金，实际作为国家财政收入，并未专款专用。
    目前，货运中约有20％属100公里以内的短途，不能发挥铁路“长大重”的优势；每年承运几千万吨的成品油，不能发挥铁路双向运输的优势。这类运输可由公路和管道分流，铁路将节省的运力用于煤炭等长途运输，缓解能源运输紧张，从而发挥铁路和公路、管道的综合优势。这样调整运输结构，可以在同样投入条件下，取得更大的运输能力和更高的社会、经济效益。这是经国家正式颁布的正确政策，应当提高其严肃性，认真实施。
