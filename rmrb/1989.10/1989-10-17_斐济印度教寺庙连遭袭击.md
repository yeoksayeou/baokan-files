Four Hindu temples in the second-largest city of Lautoka in southern Fiji were consecutively attacked with Molotov cocktails. Eighteen indigenous Fijians were arrested by the police.

The incident occurred while Indian-Fijians were worshipping on the 15th. According to reports, no one was injured, but the temples were damaged, with estimated losses amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.

After the incident, Fiji's acting Prime Minister, Josefa Iloilovatu, stated that the interim government would not tolerate such "unlawful acts" and would "handle this matter fairly."

A Hindu leader later also made a statement, saying that this incident was politically motivated and was "deliberately instigated and directly targeted at non-Christian social groups."

The Fiji police stated that the ten men and eight women arrested in this incident would be prosecuted according to law on the 16th.

    斐济印度教寺庙连遭袭击
    在斐济南部第二大城市劳托卡的四座印度教寺庙连续遭到燃烧弹袭击，十八名土著斐济人被警方逮捕。
    这起事件是在印度裔斐济人十五日正在作礼拜时发生的。据报道，当时没有人受伤，但寺庙却遭到了破坏，估计损失达数万美元。
    事件发生后，斐济代理总理约塞法塔·卡米卡米萨发表谈话说，临时政府不会容忍这种“不正当的行动”，并“将公正处理这件事”。
    印度教领袖事后也发表了谈话，他说，这次事件是有政治目的的，是“蓄意制造，并直接针对非基督教社会团体的”。
    斐济警方表示，在这次事件中被捕的十名男人和八名妇女十六日将被依法起诉。
