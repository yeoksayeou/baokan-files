When people think of large steel enterprises, images of "stupid, big, black, and rough" often come to mind, along with various unpleasant occupational diseases. However, at Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation, a super-large steel conglomerate with a history of over 70 years and 400,000 employees, a new image of "clean, tidy, neat, and beautiful" is presented everywhere.

This not only demonstrates Anshan Iron and Steel's level of enterprise management but also shows that China's large industrial enterprises have reached a new height in civilized production and worker health and sanitation.

Building a Civilized Environment

The simplest and most accurate way to assess the sanitation of a unit is to visit their restrooms. In Anshan Iron and Steel, all 3,484 restrooms in the company have undergone 78% renovation or reconstruction, with added lighting, heating, running water for hand washing, and toilet paper.

The density of the "four pests" is also decreasing. The company's substations, canteens, and various warehouses have a rat density of zero, while the average indoor rat density is 0.28%, and the outdoor density is 0.22%. The densities of mosquitoes, flies, and cockroaches have reached the standards set by the National Hygiene and Health Committee.

In the past four years, Anshan Iron and Steel has demolished 312,000 square meters of illegal and dilapidated buildings, planted 455,000 trees, 3,520,000 hedges, 768,000 square meters of lawns, built 3,500 flower beds, and 300 scenic spots. The company's greening coverage rate has reached 16.38%.

Gradually Eliminating Sources of Disease

Improving labor hygiene conditions has led to a reduction in the incidence of occupational diseases. Compared to 10 years ago, the amount of dust falling in the plant area has decreased from 280 tons per square kilometer per month to 79 tons, the dust qualification rate has increased from 44% to 85.6%, the pollution factor qualification rate has increased from 22% to 82.1%, and the poisoning detection rate has decreased from 0.28‰ to 0.16‰. The average working age of pneumoconiosis patients has been extended by 11.7 years, and the average lifespan has been extended by 5 years.

In the company's 256 canteens, 93% have been reconstructed according to the requirements of the "Food Hygiene Law," with a utilization rate and completeness rate of sanitary facilities reaching 99.7%. In 97% of the canteens, operations have been mechanized, disinfection has been scientifically managed, and warehouses have been standardized. More than 94% have reached the first-grade sanitary standard.

In the past four years, the company has not had any food poisoning incidents. All 54 single-person dormitories have been standardized and hotel-like, with 97% reaching the first-grade sanitary standard. All 19 large kindergartens have reached the first-grade sanitary standard. In 613 bathhouses, 93% and in 1,717 worker restrooms, 96% have reached the first-grade sanitary standard.

The comprehensive indicators for the eight most common legally mandated infectious diseases in Anshan Iron and Steel have also been decreasing year by year.

Enhancing Health Awareness

Additionally, the company's leadership and the majority of workers have enhanced their health awareness, which is difficult to express in numbers.

As the times develop, people increasingly recognize that enterprises must not only ensure workers' health through labor time and labor intensity but also protect workers' health by improving the labor and living environments. Over the years, Anshan Iron and Steel's patriotic health work has, like product quality management, formed a strict set of management systems. During the company's production scheduling meetings, patriotic health work is also arranged. The company's leaders spend three days each month leading relevant department heads to inspect health work and solve existing problems.

The entire company has also established a strict law-enforcing health supervision team and clearly stipulated that units whose sanitation does not reach the standard of a municipal advanced sanitation unit cannot be evaluated as provincial, municipal, or company-level civilized units or as advanced units in creating a "six-good" enterprise.

    把工厂变成职工的生活乐园
    ——鞍钢卫生保健工作巡礼
    韩长林
    提起大型钢铁企业，人们的眼前通常就浮现出“傻、大、黑、粗”的形象，还会想到种种讨厌的职业病。
    然而，在鞍山钢铁公司，一个拥有70多年历史、40万职工的特大型钢铁联合企业，处处呈现出“洁、齐、净、美”的新面貌。
    这不仅显示了鞍钢的企业管理水平，也体现了我国大型工业企业文明生产、职工卫生保健达到了一个新高度。
    建设文明环境
    看一个单位卫生状况如何，最简单也最准确的办法，就是访一访他们的厕所。鞍钢全公司3484个厕所，78％经过了整修或翻建，都增加了照明、暖气、流水洗手设备，并备有手纸。
      “四害”密度也在下降。全公司的变电所、食堂和各种库房等特殊场所，鼠密度为零，其它室内鼠密度平均为0.28％，室外为0.22％。蚊、蝇、蟑螂密度达到全国爱卫会规定的标准。
    近4年鞍钢拆除违章建筑及简陋房屋31.2万平方米，栽树45.5万棵，栽绿篱352万多株，栽草坪76.8万平方米，建花坛3500多处，建景点小品300多处，全公司绿化覆盖率达16.38％。
    逐步消灭病源
    劳动卫生状况改善，职业病发病率降低。同10年前相比，厂区粉尘降尘量由每月每平方公里280吨降至79吨，粉尘合格率由44％提高到85.6％，污染因子合格率由22％提高到82.1％，中毒检出率由0.28‰下降到0.16‰。尘肺病人平均发病工龄延长11.7年，平均寿命延长5年。
    全公司256个食堂中，93％按《食品卫生法》要求改建，卫生设施使用率和完好率达99.7％，97％的食堂实现操作机械化、消毒科学化、库房管理标准化，94％以上达到甲级卫生标准。
    近4年全公司没有发生食物中毒事故。54个独身宿舍全部实现标准化、旅馆化，97％达到甲级卫生标准。19所大型幼儿园全部达到甲级卫生标准。613个浴池中的93％和1717个职工休息室中的96％达到了甲级卫生标准。
    8种常见的法定传染病的综合指标在鞍钢也逐年降低。增强卫生意识
    此外，公司领导和广大职工增强了卫生意识，这是难以用数字表示的。
    时代发展到今天，越来越使人认识到，企业不仅要从劳动时间、劳动强度等方面来保证职工的健康，更要从改善劳动环境、生活环境来保护劳动者的健康。多年来，鞍钢的爱国卫生工作也像产品质量管理一样，形成了一套严格的管理制度。在公司的生产调度会上同时部署爱国卫生工作，公司领导每个月用3天时间带领有关部门负责人深入各厂检查卫生工作，解决存在的问题。
    全公司还组建了一支严格执法的卫生监督队伍，并明确规定，凡卫生未达到市卫生先进单位标准的，当年不能评为省、市、公司的精神文明单位和创“六好企业”的先进单位。
