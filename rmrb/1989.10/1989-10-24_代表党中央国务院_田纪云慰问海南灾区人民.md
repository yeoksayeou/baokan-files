Representing the Party Central Committee and the State Council, Deputy Premier Tian Jiyun comforts the people of Hainan affected by disasters.

Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, October 23 (Reporter Tianchuan) - Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Tian Jiyun, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, comforts the people of Hainan who have been continuously hit by strong typhoons.

Upon arriving in Hainan yesterday, Deputy Premier Tian Jiyun and his entourage quickly went to the heavily affected counties of Wanning and Lingshui, inspecting the disaster situation along the way and conveying the cordial greetings of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the disaster-stricken people.

In the village of Dacun, Nanqiao Township, Wanning County, 22 out of 37 households had their homes blown down by the typhoon. Deputy Premier Tian Jiyun entered the makeshift thatched hut of farmer Wang Yurui and inquired about the disaster situation. Tian Jiyun said, "General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng are very concerned about the people in the disaster areas and have specially sent me to visit everyone and convey the greetings of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to the disaster-stricken people. Local leaders should mobilize the masses to engage in production and self-rescue, first solving the problem of food, gradually restoring production, and relying on their own efforts to rebuild their homes. For the waterlogged rice, efforts should be made to harvest and dry it quickly to prevent it from rotting. If it cannot be eaten by people, it can be used as feed to minimize losses."

While listening to the report from the Lingshui County Party Committee and County Government, Tian Jiyun said, "First, solve the problem of dangerous school buildings to allow students to resume classes as soon as possible. The county should help the town, the town should help the village, and the village should help the household. Lightly affected households should help heavily affected households, and the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation should be promoted. In disaster relief, Communist Party members should play a pioneering and exemplary role, and through disaster relief, strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses."

Xu Shijie and Liu Jianfeng accompanied Deputy Premier Tian Jiyun in inspecting the disaster situation.

    新华社海口10月23日电  （记者田川）中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理田纪云，代表党中央、国务院慰问连续遭受强台风袭击的海南灾区人民。
    田纪云副总理一行昨天到海南后，迅速来到受灾较重的万宁、陵水两县，边走边察看灾情，转达党中央和国务院对灾区人民的亲切慰问。
    在万宁县南桥乡大村，全村37户人家，有22户的房子被台风刮倒。田纪云副总理走进农民王家裕临时搭建的茅棚中，询问受灾情况。田纪云说，江泽民总书记、李鹏总理非常关心灾区人民，专门派我来看望大家，转达党中央和国务院对灾区群众的问候。各级领导要发动群众进行生产自救，首先解决吃饭问题，逐步恢复生产，自力更生，重建家园。对被水浸泡的水稻，要抓紧抢收抢晒，不要烂掉，人不能吃的，可以做饲料，尽量减少损失。
    在听取陵水县委、县政府的汇报时，田纪云说，要先解决学校的危房，让学生尽快上课。要县帮镇，镇帮村，村帮户，轻灾户帮助重灾户，发扬一方有难、八方支援的协作精神，发动群众互相帮助，积极进行生产自救。在抢险救灾中，共产党员要起先锋模范作用，通过救灾密切党和群众的关系。
