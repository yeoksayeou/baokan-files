Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 3rd.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet, after heated debates, tonight passed by a majority vote an emergency resolution banning strikes by workers in the transportation and key economic sectors.

In recent times, strikes by workers in some Soviet enterprises have caused enormous material losses and seriously affected the winter supply to residents.

To ensure the normal operation of production and life, the resolution passed by the Soviet Supreme Soviet stipulates that before the law on mediation of collective labor disputes is enacted, strikes by workers in transportation, energy, metallurgy, and chemical enterprises are prohibited. The resolution calls on legislative and law enforcement agencies to take emergency measures to crack down on illegal acts that disrupt transportation work.

The Soviet Parliament finds the current state of the Caucasus Railway unacceptable and orders the regional state management agencies to immediately restore normal train operations. It also authorizes the Soviet government, if necessary, to transfer the management of these railway bureaus to the Soviet Ministry of Transportation. Meanwhile, it orders the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Transportation to be responsible for guarding certain sections and railway facilities, ensuring the safety of transportation workers and citizens.

    苏联议会通过一项紧急决议
    禁止铁路和基础经济部门工人罢工
    新华社莫斯科10月3日电  苏联最高苏维埃经过激烈争论，今晚以多数票通过了关于禁止铁路运输和基础经济部门工人罢工的紧急决议。
    近来，苏联一些企业的工人罢工，造成巨大物质损失，并且严重影响冬季向居民的供应。
    为了确保生产和生活的正常进行，苏联最高苏维埃通过的决议规定，在调解集体劳动纠纷法获得通过以前，禁止运输、燃料动力综合体、冶金和化工企业的职工罢工。决议要求各立法和执法机关采取紧急措施取缔破坏运输工作的违法行为。
    苏联议会认为外高加索铁路的现状令人不能容忍，责成该地区的国家管理机关立即恢复列车的正常运行，并授权苏联政府必要时可将这些铁路局的领导权交给苏联交通部，同时责成苏联内务部、国防部和交通部负责保卫某些路段和铁路设施，保障运输工人和公民的安全。
