Comrades,

Today, we gather here to solemnly commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Comrade Li Siguang. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend warm greetings and high respect to the comrades who have long been dedicated to the geological front, to the broad masses of intellectuals throughout the country who love socialist China and dedicate themselves to the Four Modernizations! I call on everyone to learn from Li Siguang and carry forward the spirit of Li Siguang.

Comrade Li Siguang was an outstanding scientist in China, a renowned social activist and educator, and a great patriot. In his youth, he actively participated in the national democratic revolution of the time and was one of the founding members of the Chinese Alliance. He made significant contributions during the Xinhai Revolution. Later, he dedicated himself to geology, striving to benefit the people, and became an important pioneer in Chinese geology. He was the main founder of the geological industry in New China and an internationally renowned geologist. He devoted his life to science, to the revolution and construction of the motherland, and to the people. He is an outstanding representative of the advanced intellectuals in China. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, along with other veteran proletarian revolutionaries, gave him high praise, calling him "a banner."

Throughout his life, Comrade Li Siguang not only left us with precious scientific heritage but also with invaluable spiritual wealth. This includes his unwavering love for the motherland, his noble integrity in being loyal to the Communist Party and the socialist cause, his great ambition to revitalize China and benefit the people, his upright and honest, self-reliant, and resilient character, his humble and rigorous, practical and innovative scientific style, his exemplary teaching and tireless guidance, and his spirit of unremitting struggle and devotion. The geological industry created by him and his fellow geologists has become an important pillar of China's national economic construction. His spirit has inspired generations of people in China to dedicate themselves to the glorious and magnificent geological industry and the entire scientific and technological industry. Although Comrade Li Siguang has been gone for over ten years, he remains and will continue to be a banner for China's intellectuals.

We should learn from Comrade Li Siguang's patriotism, his spirit of loving the motherland, serving the motherland, and bringing glory to the nation. Throughout his life, Comrade Li Siguang always prioritized the interests of the Chinese nation, always safeguarding and defending the nation's dignity, and striving for the independence and prosperity of the motherland. In the days when the motherland was oppressed and humiliated by foreign imperialists, he refused to be subjugated and resolutely joined the revolution. When the revolution faced setbacks, he did not follow the trend, and even while abroad, he closely followed the fate of the motherland, studied diligently, and made finding and developing underground resources for the enrichment of the people and the strengthening of the nation his lifelong goal. Facing those who looked down on China, he stood tall and unyielding, neither servile nor arrogant, and made a name for himself in the international academic community with his remarkable scientific achievements. Upon the founding of New China, he "rolled up his books in joyous excitement," braved the dangers, and returned to the embrace of the motherland, turning his patriotic fervor into a resolve to serve the nation. With the enthusiastic care and strong support of the Party and the government, he worked hard and created a prosperous future, making significant contributions in establishing and developing China's geological science, building China's own petroleum industry and other mineral industries, and pioneering earthquake prediction, among many other fields. In China, there are many intellectuals like Comrade Li Siguang who love the motherland, serve the motherland, and bring glory to the nation. They are the backbone and pride of China's intellectuals. By commemorating and learning from Li Siguang, we should be like him, with great aspirations, loving the motherland, and striving to serve the nation, working hard to become talented individuals with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, and forever linking our future and destiny with that of the motherland.

We should learn from Comrade Li Siguang's pursuit of truth and light. Throughout his life, Comrade Li Siguang experienced many twists and turns, enduring countless hardships, transforming from a patriot and democrat into a communist. He followed the historical and social progress of the times, walking a path of persistent struggle for truth and light as an intellectual. His life spanned several eras. From his tortuous experiences, it is clear that the fate of intellectuals is closely tied to the fate of the nation. In the old China, oppressed by the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, many intellectuals, despite their talents and scientific patriotism, saw their ideals shattered. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, only in the socialist New China, could there be a spring for science and a spring for intellectuals! Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, the wisdom and talents of China's broad masses of intellectuals have been fully displayed. They have firmly united with the working masses, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, achieving significant progress in the scientific and technological front, entering the world's advanced ranks in several fields, and making great contributions to the various fronts of socialist construction. By commemorating and learning from Li Siguang, we should be educated by his life of pursuing truth and light, firmly loving the Communist Party, firmly defending the socialist system, and unwaveringly adhering to the correct political direction.

We should learn from Comrade Li Siguang's spirit of unity and struggle. He was not only a scholar with profound knowledge and deep insights but also an outstanding social activist. To promote China's socialist revolution and construction and to develop China's scientific cause, he paid great attention to relying on the collective wisdom, skillfully organizing and uniting scholars from various circles, and founding many important scientific and technological organizations, uniting a large number of patriots and international friends. After liberation, he long served as a leader in the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the World Federation of Scientific Workers, the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and geological departments, earning wide acclaim and respect in the scientific and intellectual circles both at home and abroad. By commemorating and learning from Li Siguang, we should, like him, start from the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, strive to promote the independence, unity, and prosperity of the motherland, carry forward the spirit of unity and struggle, strive to promote social progress, political stability, and people's happiness, and advance the cause of China's socialist modernization.

Although the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion have brought some difficulties to our work, after the storm has passed, we have made great strides forward. The line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have not changed, and the Party's policy towards intellectuals has not changed. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's views and judgments, which shine with the light of Marxism, such as "science and technology are productive forces," "scientific and technological modernization is the key to the Four Modernizations," "broad masses of intellectuals are part of the working class," and "the most important thing is to respect knowledge and respect talents," remain the theoretical basis for formulating and implementing relevant policies. To build China into a strong socialist modernized country, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class. As part of the working class, the broad masses of intellectuals bear the glorious and arduous task of building China's socialist material and spiritual civilization. The Party and the government will continue to adhere to the principle of "respecting knowledge and respecting talents," striving to create and provide good working and living conditions for intellectuals. The Party has high hopes for intellectuals. We are confident that, in the face of the heavy historical mission, the broad masses of intellectuals will, like the older generation of scientists such as Comrade Li Siguang, dedicate themselves to serving the motherland and benefiting the people, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, strive to improve their skills, and continuously pursue excellence, making greater contributions to the advancement of socialist modernization!

The cause of socialism led by the Communist Party of China is a long and arduous one, but it is also a brilliant one. It urgently needs and will cultivate tens of thousands of talents like Li Siguang!

　　学习李四光
　　——在纪念李四光同志诞辰一百周年大会上的讲话
　　杨尚昆同志们：
    今天我们在这里集会，隆重纪念李四光同志诞辰100周年。我谨代表党中央、国务院，向长年奋斗在地质战线的同志们，向热爱社会主义祖国、献身四化建设的全国广大知识分子，致以亲切的问候和崇高的敬意！并号召大家向李四光学习，发扬李四光精神。
    李四光同志是我国卓越的科学家，著名的社会活动家和教育家，伟大的爱国者。他在青少年时代就积极投身当时的民族民主革命，是中国同盟会创建会员之一，在辛亥革命中建立了功绩。后来他献身地质科学，致力于造福人民，成为中国地质科学的重要开拓者，是新中国地质事业的主要奠基人和国际著名的地质学家。他把一生奉献给科学，奉献给祖国的革命和建设事业，奉献给人民。他是中国先进知识分子的杰出代表。毛主席、周总理等老一辈无产阶级革命家曾给予他很高的评价，称赞“李四光同志是一面旗帜”。
    李四光同志一生不仅给我们留下了珍贵的科学遗产，而且给我们留下了宝贵的精神财富。这就是他始终不渝地热爱祖国的赤子之心；忠于共产党、忠于社会主义事业的高尚情操；振兴中华、造福人民的宏大志气；正直诚实、自强刚毅的优良品质；谦虚严谨、求实创新的科学作风；身教言传、诲人不倦的师表风范；奋斗不息、鞠躬尽瘁的献身精神。以他为代表的地质学家所开创的地质事业，已经成为我国国民经济建设的重要支柱；他的精神鼓舞着我国几代人献身于光荣而豪迈的地质事业以及整个科技事业。李四光同志虽然离开我们10多年了，但他现在和将来仍然是我国知识分子的一面旗帜。
    我们要学习李四光同志热爱祖国、报效祖国、为国争光的爱国主义精神。李四光同志一生始终以中华民族的利益为重，处处维护和捍卫民族的尊严，毕生追求祖国的独立和富强。在祖国沉沦于外国列强奴役和凌辱的年代，他不甘屈辱，毅然投身革命；当革命遭到挫折时，他不随波逐流，即使身在国外，也一直热切关注祖国命运，奋发学习，把为富民强国而寻找和开发地下资源，当作终生奋斗的目标；面对那些藐视中国的外国人，他傲骨凌霜，不卑不亢，以显赫的科学成就著称于国际学术界。新中国一成立，他“漫卷诗书喜欲狂”，排除艰险，毅然奔回祖国怀抱，把满腔的爱国热忱化作报国之志。在党和政府的热情关怀和大力支持下，他奋发图强，艰苦创业，在创立和发展我国地质科学事业、建立中国自己的石油工业和其他矿产工业、开创地震预报等许多领域，作出了举世瞩目的贡献。在我国，有着许多像李四光同志那样热爱祖国、报效祖国、为国争光的知识分子。他们是中国知识分子的脊梁，是中国知识分子的骄傲。我们纪念和学习李四光，就应该像他那样胸怀大志，热爱祖国、立志报国，努力使自己成为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的人才，把自己的前途和命运永远同祖国联系在一起。
    我们要学习李四光同志追求真理、追求光明的崇高品格。李四光同志一生历经曲折坎坷，费尽千辛万苦，从一个爱国主义者、民主主义者，成长为一个共产主义者。他顺应历史和社会进步的时代潮流，走过了一条为追求真理和光明而坚持奋斗的知识分子的道路。他一生跨越几个时代。从他坎坷曲折的经历中可以清楚地看到，知识分子的命运与国家的命运是息息相关的。在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山沉重压迫下的旧中国，许多知识分子纵然才华横溢，满怀科学救国的热忱，他们的理想终究仍化为泡影。只有在中国共产党的领导下，只有在社会主义的新中国，才会有科学的春天，才会有知识分子的春天！建国40年来，我国广大知识分子的聪明才智得到了充分的施展。他们坚定地同工农大众结合，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗精神，不仅在科技战线上取得长足进步，在若干领域内步入世界先进行列，而且在社会主义建设的各条战线上作出了重大贡献。我们纪念和学习李四光，就应当从他追求真理、追求光明的一生中受到教育，坚定地热爱共产党，坚定地维护社会主义制度，始终不渝地坚持正确的政治方向。
    我们要学习李四光同志团结奋斗的优良作风。他不仅是一位学识渊博、造诣精深的科学家，而且是一位杰出的社会活动家。为了推动我国社会主义革命和建设，为了发展我国的科学事业，他十分注意依靠集体的智慧，善于组织和联合各界学者，曾创立过许多重要的科技团体，团结了一大批志士仁人和国际友人。解放后，他长期担任全国政协、世界科协、中国科协和中国科学院、地质部门的领导工作，在海内外的科学界、知识界赢得广泛的赞誉和尊重。我们纪念和学习李四光，就应当像他那样坚持从中华民族的根本利益出发，着眼于努力促进祖国的独立、统一和繁荣，发扬团结奋斗的精神，努力促进社会进步、政局稳定和人民幸福，推进我国的社会主义现代化事业不断前进。
    尽管不久前的那场动乱和反革命暴乱给我们的工作带来了一些困难，但风波平息之后，我们又大步前进了。党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策没有变，党的知识分子政策也没有变。小平同志提出的“科学技术是生产力”、“科技现代化是四化的关键”、“广大知识分子是工人阶级的一部分”、“最重要的还是尊重知识、尊重人才”，这些闪烁着马克思主义光辉的观点和论断，仍然是我们今后制定和执行有关方针政策的理论依据。要把我国建设成为社会主义现代化强国，必须全心全意依靠工人阶级。作为工人阶级一个组成部分的广大知识分子，肩负着我国社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设的光荣而艰巨的任务。党和政府将继续本着“尊重知识、尊重人才”的方针，努力为知识分子创造并提供良好的工作条件和生活条件。党对知识分子寄以深切厚望。我们深信，广大知识分子在历史的重任面前，一定会像李四光同志等老一辈科学家那样，以献身祖国、造福人民为己任，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，努力钻研业务，不断精益求精，为推进社会主义现代化建设做出更大的贡献！
    中国共产党领导的我国社会主义事业，是任重道远的事业，是前程灿烂的事业。它热切需要并必将造就千千万万个李四光式的人才！
