Deputy Director Cao Honglin of a certain warehouse in the Second Artillery Corps was vilified and slandered by some people because of his honesty and uprightness. These people even vented their anger on his wife and children. With the support of the Second Artillery Corps' Logistics Department and the Discipline Inspection Commission, Cao Honglin finally shook off the influence of the perverse winds and was commended and trusted. This incident, apart from once again proving that "evil cannot overcome justice" and boosting people's confidence in the fight against corruption, also reflects the complexity and arduousness of the anti-corruption struggle from one aspect. It reminds people that supporting honest and upright officials and striking down corrupt elements are equally important tasks that go hand in hand.

Honesty and uprightness are consistent requirements of the Party for officials and are the main characteristics of public servants. Supporting honest and upright officials does not need special emphasis. However, in recent years, due to the weakening of Party building and ideological and political work, some negative phenomena have taken advantage of the reform and opening up to spread. Some people have become accustomed to satisfying their private desires by any means, while officials who are upright and honest are seen as rigid and outdated, and are ridiculed and retaliated against. If Cao Honglin had not received support from his superiors, he might have been forced out of the Party Committee!

Therefore, supporting honest and upright officials has become a matter worth emphasizing at present.

For leaders with strong Party spirit, supporting honest and upright officials is a natural and unquestionable duty. Why do some people have problems with their ideological understanding?

The reason lies in two aspects: first, they do not fully understand the complexity and arduousness of the anti-corruption struggle, and underestimate the collusion of some people in exchanging power for power, exchanging power for money, and deceiving superiors and oppressing subordinates; second, they lack the style of in-depth investigation and research. Some comrades, when they see a case, neither go down to investigate nor send someone to investigate, but rely entirely on subordinates' reports to judge right and wrong, resulting in often being biased and deceived. The leaders of the relevant departments of the Second Artillery Corps were able to clarify the right and wrong of the Cao Honglin case, first because they had a correct view of the situation, and second because they conducted in-depth investigations and research.

Supporting honest and upright officials is not only an important responsibility for leading cadres but also a duty for every citizen who is committed to clean governance and hopes to improve Party style and social ethics. In some places, the prevalence of improper practices has led to the situation where good people are bullied and corrupt officials are powerful. This is not because those who engage in improper practices are more cunning, nor is it because they have the magical power to cover the sky with one hand. It is because in these places and units, there are too few officials like Cao Honglin who resolutely fight against them, and too few people who support such officials.

If everyone enhances their awareness of advocating honesty and punishing corruption, and forms a social ethos of "honesty is glorious, corruption is shameful," corrupt practices will have no place to hide, honest and upright officials will be justified, and the Party's clean governance and anti-corruption struggle will achieve greater results. The Four Modernizations will be better guaranteed, and the pace will be faster.

    支持廉洁奉公的干部
    本报评论员
    二炮某仓库副主任曹红林因为廉洁奉公得罪了一些人，这些人对他造谣中伤，甚至迁怒于他的老婆孩子。在二炮后勤部和纪委领导的支持下，曹红林终于摆脱了歪风邪气的困扰，并受到了表彰和信用。这件事除了又一次证明“邪不压正”，增强人们反腐败的必胜信心外，还从一个侧面反映了反腐败斗争的复杂性和艰巨性。它提醒人们：支持廉洁奉公的干部和打击腐败分子是并行不悖、同样重要的事情。
    廉洁奉公，是党对干部的一贯要求，也是人民公仆的主要标志。支持廉洁奉公的干部，本无特别强调的必要。但是，近年来，由于党的建设和思想政治工作削弱，伴随改革开放而来的某些不良现象趁机蔓延，一些人对不择手段满足私欲习以为常，而一身正气、廉洁奉公的干部反而被视为呆板、僵化，受到冷嘲热讽和打击报复。曹红林如果得不到上级领导的支持，不是就很可能被挤出党委吗！
    因此，支持廉洁奉公的干部，在当前成了一件值得强调的事情。
    对于党性强的领导同志来说，支持廉洁奉公的干部是理所当然、没有问题的。为什么有的人思想认识会出问题？
    原因在于两个方面，一是对反腐败斗争的复杂性和艰巨性了解不足，对一些人串通起来搞权权交换、权钱交易、欺下蒙上，估计不足；二是缺乏深入调查研究的作风。有些同志见到案子既不下去调查，也不派人调查，全凭下级汇报判断是非，结果往往偏听偏信，上当吃亏。二炮有关部门的领导能够弄清曹红林案件的是非曲直，一是靠他们对形势有正确的看法，二是靠深入调查研究。
    支持廉洁奉公的干部，不仅领导干部要视为重要的职责，每一个有志于廉政建设、希望党风和社会风气好转的公民都应该视为己任。有些地方不正之风猖獗，出现好人受欺、贪官得势的情况，不是因为搞不正之风的人手段高明，更不是因为搞不正之风的人有一手遮天的魔力，而是因为在这些地方和单位，像曹红林这样坚决与之斗争的干部太少，支持这样的干部的人太少。
    如果大家都增强了倡廉肃贪的意识，形成了“廉洁光荣、腐败可耻”的社会风尚，腐败现象就难有栖身之所，廉洁奉公的干部就会理直气壮，党领导的廉政建设和反腐败斗争就会取得更大的成果，四化建设就会得到更加充分的保障，步伐就会更快。
