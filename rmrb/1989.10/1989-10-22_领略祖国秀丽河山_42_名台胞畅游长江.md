The waters of the Yangtze River were calm and peaceful this afternoon. At 2:10 PM, 15 kilometers upstream from the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, two red signal flares were launched into the sky. Forty-two swimming enthusiasts from various parts of Taiwan dove into the water, beginning their swim across the Yangtze River.

This swimming team, organized by the Taiwan Zhongyuan Film Company's morning swim club, consists of 48 members. Among them are doctors, journalists, businesspeople, students, teachers, and drivers. Although they come from different professions and vary in age and gender, they have all come together this time to experience the joy of swimming across the ten-thousand-li Yangtze River.

A Taiwanese compatriot on the lifeboat told a reporter, "I came to Nanjing decades ago, and this time returning to the old place, I found that Nanjing has changed greatly. Although I couldn't get into the water today, I still feel very happy."

　　42名台胞畅游长江
    据新华社南京10月19日电　（记者高峰）今天下午扬子江上风平浪静。在南京长江大桥上游15公里的长江江面上，两颗红色信号弹于2时10分腾空而起，42名来自台湾各地的游泳爱好者跃入水中，开始畅游长江。
    这个由台湾中影公司晨泳团组织的长江泳渡团，共有48名团员，他们中有医生、记者、商人、学生、教师、司机，虽然行业不同，年龄性别不一，但他们这次结团来大陆就是为了领略一下畅游万里长江的乐趣。
    救生船上的一位台湾同胞对记者说：“我几十年前来过南京，这次重返旧地，发现南京变化巨大。今天虽然没能下水，但仍感到十分高兴。”
