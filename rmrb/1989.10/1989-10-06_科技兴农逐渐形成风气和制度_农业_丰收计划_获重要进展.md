The "Harvest Plan," jointly organized and implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Finance, with the main goal of promoting large-scale, wide-area agricultural technology, has made significant progress this year. All 20 national projects have been fully implemented, with the promotion area for crops such as grain, cotton, and oil reaching 72.45 million mu. Most of the early rice and wheat have been harvested. The yield of the autumn crops in the project areas is generally better than that in the open fields.

The "Harvest Plan" office of the Ministry of Agriculture recently recommended to the reporter a number of units that have achieved large-scale, wide-area increases in production this year: The 1 million mu hybrid corn project in Sichuan Province increased the average yield per mu by 16.8% compared to the previous three years. The 1.5 million mu wheat project in Shaanxi Province increased production by 18.7%. The 2.4 million mu rice new variety demonstration project undertaken by the South China Grain and Oil Crop Science and Technology Joint Development Group increased the average yield per mu by 10%. The lean meat pig project in Hubei Province exceeded the planned output of commercial pigs by 51% in the first half of the year.

The nationwide "Harvest Plan" has progressed smoothly, which is an important reason for the success of the "Harvest Plan" this year. According to reports, 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as 12 separately planned cities, have established "Harvest Plan" leading groups, actively increasing funding and material inputs through multiple channels. In addition to the central special funds, various places have allocated matching funds totaling 31 million yuan this year. Loans for production materials related to the "Harvest Plan" amount to 260 million yuan, 400,000 tons of fertilizer, 2,110 tons of plastic film, and increased quantities of pesticides, feed, diesel, and agricultural machinery. In the first half of the year, the country held more than 1,500 technical training classes related to the "Harvest Plan," training over 2 million farmers, and distributing more than 2 million technical promotion materials.

    科技兴农逐渐形成风气和制度
    农业“丰收计划”获重要进展
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：由农业部、财政部共同组织实施的，以大范围大面积科技兴农为主旨的“丰收计划”，今年以来获重要进展。全国20个项目已全部落实，仅粮棉油等作物技术推广面积就达7245万亩，大部分小麦早稻已获丰收。项目的大秋作物普遍好于大田。
    农业部“丰收计划”办公室日前向记者推荐了一批今年获大范围大面积增产的项目单位：四川省百万亩杂交玉米项目比前三年平均亩产增加16.8％，陕西省150万亩小麦项目增产幅度达18.7％，南方粮油作物科技联合开发集团承担的240万亩水稻新品种示范项目平均单产增加10％，湖北省的瘦肉猪项目上半年超额完成出栏商品猪51％。
    全国上下农业“升温”，是今年“丰收计划”进展顺利的重要原因。据介绍，今年29个省、市、自治区和12个计划单列市成立了“丰收计划”领导小组，积极多渠道增加资金和物资的配套投入。据不完全统计，除中央的专项资金外，今年各地安排的配套资金达3100万元，与“丰收计划”有关的生产资料贷款2.6亿元，化肥40万吨，农膜2110吨。农药、饲料、柴油和农机具等投入量也明显增加。上半年，全国围绕“丰收计划”共举办各类技术培训班1500多期，培训农民200多万人次，编发技术推广资料200多万份。
