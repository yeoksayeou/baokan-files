The Chinese representative, Yu Mengjia, today in the Fourth Committee of this session of the UN General Assembly, discussed the issue of decolonization. He stated that China has always sympathized with and supported the struggle of the people of colonies and non-self-governing territories for self-determination and independence, and regards this as its international duty. In the future, China will continue to work with the international community to make efforts to complete the process of decolonization.

Yu Mengjia emphasized that ensuring that the fair and free elections scheduled for November in Namibia are held is key to achieving Namibia's independence.

He hoped that the South African authorities would keep their promises, fulfill their obligations, and not take any actions that would disrupt the elections in Namibia or hinder Namibia's timely independence.

Yu Mengjia also hoped that the relevant parties would continue to seek paths to resolution, so that the Western Sahara issue could be resolved as soon as possible.

Yu Mengjia pointed out that there are still some non-self-governing territories in the world that have not achieved self-determination and independence. The countries managing these territories should fully respect the will of the people in these territories and their right to freely determine the future status of their territories.

Yu Mengjia also stated that China opposes any country stationing troops, establishing military bases, and building military facilities in the territories of other countries, including colonies and non-self-governing territories. China advocates for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the dismantling of all foreign military bases and facilities.

According to relevant UN documents, in addition to Namibia and Western Sahara, there are still 17 territories under the rule of foreign governments. These include New Caledonia, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar, American Samoa, Guam, and others.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Kenyan Ambassador to the United Nations, Michael Okio, recently wrote a letter to the President of the UN Security Council on behalf of African countries, requesting an emergency meeting to discuss the "serious situation" in Namibia.

The letter stated that South Africa's control over news and administration in Namibia, which is in the transitional phase of seeking independence, would not guarantee the "free and fair elections" proposed by UN Resolution 435.

Since April 1, the United Nations has sent the UN Transition Assistance Group to Namibia to prepare for the November 7 elections. However, African countries have complained that the strength of this UN force is insufficient and that South Africa is attempting to sabotage the elections.

　　我代表在联大会议上发言强调
　　应保证纳米比亚选举自由公正
　　非洲国家要求安理会紧急讨论纳米比亚目前事态
    本报联合国10月19日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国代表俞孟嘉今天在本届联大第4委员会辩论非殖民化问题时表示，中国一贯同情和支持殖民地和非自治领土人民争取自决和独立的正义斗争，并视此为自己应尽的国际义务；今后将继续同国际社会一道，为彻底完成非殖民化进程作出努力。
    俞孟嘉强调指出，充分保证今年11月在纳米比亚举行公正和自由的大选是实现纳米比亚独立的关键。
    他希望南非当局信守诺言，认真履约，不要采取破坏纳米比亚大选以及一切不利于纳米比亚如期独立的行动。
    俞孟嘉还希望有关方面继续寻求和解的途径，使西撒问题尽快获得解决。
    俞孟嘉指出，现在，世界上还有一些非自治领土尚未实现自决和独立，管理这些领土的国家应充分尊重这些领土上人民的意愿和自由决定其领土未来地位的权利。
    俞孟嘉还表示，中国反对任何国家在别国领土、包括在殖民地和非自治领土派驻军队、建立军事基地和军事设施，主张一切外国军队应撤出，所有的外国军事基地和军事设施应拆除。
    按照联合国的有关文件，目前除纳米比亚和西撒哈拉之外，还有17片领土在外国政府的统治之下，其中包括新喀里多尼亚，百慕大，英属维尔京岛，直布罗陀，美属维尔京岛，美属萨莫亚，关岛等。
    新华社联合国10月19日电　肯尼亚驻联合国大使迈克尔·奥基约日前代表非洲国家在给联合国安理会主席的一封信中，要求安理会召开紧急会议，讨论纳米比亚的“严重事态”。
    信中说，南非对正处于争取独立过渡阶段的纳米比亚在新闻和行政方面控制将不能保证联合国435号决议所倡议的纳米比亚进行“自由而公平的选举”。
    自4月1日起，联合国派遣了联合国过渡时期援助团前往纳米比亚，为它于11月7日进行的纳米比亚大选作准备。
    然而非洲国家则抱怨说联合国的这支部队的力量不够，南非正设法破坏大选。
