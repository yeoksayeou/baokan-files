On September 30, Beijing, it was sunny. The reporter, along with the crowd, entered the Tiananmen Square, which had been cleared of debris and was now fresh and new, to interview several tourists.

“Fearless in the face of the enemy”

Jǔ Xiǎn Dōng and Zhāng Míng Huī, retired officers from the Beijing Military Region, were both veterans of the Eighth Route Army, having enlisted in 1938 and 1941 respectively. They came to the square with their spouses and grandchildren. The reporter asked, “Weren’t you afraid of the counter-revolutionary riot that happened in Beijing recently?” Zhāng Míng Huī’s wife interjected, “We weren’t afraid of the Japanese invaders back then! Why would we be afraid of them now?” They mentioned that during the riot, their retirement home, Lù Mǐ Cāng, provided aid to over 1,000 soldiers from the martial law troops who were scattered and injured by the rioters, and the old soldiers had done another good deed. Zhāng Míng Huī proudly told the reporter that his family of six, including daughters-in-law and sons-in-law, had two couples as colonels and one as a lieutenant colonel, all contributing to the defense of the socialist motherland.

“I wouldn’t have come if I was afraid”

Chén Jùn Yì, an elderly overseas Chinese from Chicago, accepted the interview. His ancestral home is in Taishan, Guangdong. The reporter asked, “There have been many rumors abroad. Are you afraid to come to the square?” He replied, “If I was afraid, I wouldn’t have come!”

Yè Huáng Xīng, the secretary-general of the British Chinese Overseas Chinese 40th Anniversary Tour Group, introduced to the reporter that the tour group had 18 members from the British Isles, including legal, business, and academic professionals, most of whom were leaders of local Chinese associations. Abroad, they heard some news media say that “Tiananmen Square was awash with blood, and it is dangerous to go to Beijing now.” After coming here, we exposed their lies. It’s not like that. In Beijing, we also met with central leaders, and it was truly worthwhile.

“Grateful to Deng Xiaoping from the bottom of our hearts”

Sòng Gāng is the deputy head of Dà Jīng Bǎo Township, Lín Táo County, Gānsù Province. He was invited by relevant departments of the State Council to come to Beijing to learn about poverty alleviation and enrichment experiences. At 44, this was his first time at Tiananmen Square. He told the reporter that their place has big mountains and deep valleys, with very poor conditions. During the “poverty alleviation” period, farmers’ annual income per capita was less than 100 yuan, but now it has reached 250 yuan, basically solving the problem of subsistence. This is because the Party’s line at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is correct, and Deng Xiaoping is wise. During the recent counter-revolutionary riot, someone shouted “Down with Deng Xiaoping,” and the more than 6,000 people in their township were furious. The common people said, “Who is more capable than Deng Xiaoping? We are grateful to Deng Xiaoping from the bottom of our hearts!”

“The square belongs to the people”

Chén Tiān Chéng, a welder from the Beijing City Construction Company No. 1 and a member of the Communist Party, came to the square with his 5-year-old son. He told the reporter that the square had been ruined by the rioters. The reporter asked, “Did you come out to march and support during that time?” He replied, “No, I was always at work.”

Several hundred students from the affiliated primary school of Beijing Xī Chéng District Normal School came to the square with their teachers, to see the flower beds and play games. Several foreigners surrounded them taking photos. The reporter interviewed female teachers Duān Wěi and Dù Yàn Bīn. They said that bringing students to the square to play is also a form of patriotic and revolutionary heroism education, which is very meaningful. They didn’t come on “Children’s Day” this year, so they made up for this lesson now.

Several police officers from the Public Security Bureau’s Traffic Division, including Zhāng Xué Dōng, Yán Shù Táng, and Cháng Jiàn, were on duty near the west side of the Monument to the People’s Heroes. They told the reporter, “We have been on duty for many days in a row. Lunch is delivered by the bureau. To maintain the traffic order of the square, we should endure any hardship.”

Under the sunshine, the square was filled with flags, flowers, kites, and smiling faces, presenting a peaceful scene. As the reporter left the square, he asked an elderly man named Li who was flying a long dragon kite, “How long is your kite?” He proudly replied, “50 meters!”

    阳光下的广场
    本报记者　李德民
    9月30日，北京，晴。记者随人群走进清除了垃圾、焕然一新的天安门广场，采访了几位游客。
    “当年打鬼子都不怕”
    北京军区离休干部朱显东和张明辉，是先后于1938年和1941年入伍的老八路，他们带着老伴、抱着外孙女来到广场。记者问：“前些时候北京发生反革命暴乱，你们怕不怕？”张明辉的老伴抢过话头：“当年打鬼子都不怕！还怕他们？”他们说，在暴乱期间，他们住的禄米仓干休所救护了1000多名被暴徒冲散、打伤的戒严部队官兵，老战士们又立了一功。张明辉还自豪地告诉记者，他家6个孩子，加上女婿、儿媳妇，有两对上校、一对中校，都在为保卫社会主义祖国出力。
    “要怕我就不来了”
    从美国芝加哥来旅游的老华侨陈俊义先生接受了采访，他祖籍广东台山。记者问：“国外谣传不少，您来广场害怕吗？”他说：“要怕我就不来了！”
    英国华侨华人国庆40周年观光团秘书长叶煌兴向记者介绍说，观光团18位团员，来自英伦三岛，有法律、商业、学术界人士，大多是当地侨团负责人。在国外，听到有些新闻媒介说“天安门广场血流成河，现在去北京很危险”。我们来了一看，就揭穿了他们的谎言，不是那个样子。在北京，我们还见到中央领导人，真是不虚此行。
    “从心眼里感谢邓小平”
    宋刚是甘肃省临洮县达京堡乡副乡长，是受国务院有关部门邀请来京学习脱贫致富经验的，44岁，第一次到天安门广场。他对记者说，他们那里山大沟深，条件很差。“穷过渡”时，农民人均年收入不到百元，现在达到250元，基本解决了温饱问题。这是因为党的十一届三中全会路线正确，邓小平英明。前些时间在反革命暴乱中，有人喊“打倒邓小平”，他们乡的6000多口人气坏了。老百姓说：“你们谁比邓小平高明？我们从心眼里感谢邓小平！”
    “广场是人民的”
    北京市城建一公司钳工、共产党员陈天成带着他5岁的儿子来到广场。他对记者说，前些时广场被搞动乱的人糟踏得不像样子。记者问：“当时你出来游行、声援了吗？”他说：“没有，我一直在上班。”
    北京市西城区师范附属小学的几百名学生在老师带领下来到广场，看花坛，做游戏，几位外国人围着他们拍照。记者采访了女教师段伟和杜燕斌。她们说，领学生到广场来玩一玩，也是进行爱国主义和革命英雄主义教育，很有意义。今年“六一”没有来成，现在补上了这一课。
    北京市公安局公交分局的汽车停在人民英雄纪念碑西侧，张学东、阎树堂、常健等几位公安干警在值勤。他们对记者说：“我们已经连续值勤多日，午饭都是由局里送来的。为了维持好广场的交通秩序，我们再辛苦也应该。”
    阳光下的广场，旗帜、鲜花、风筝、笑脸，一片升平景象。记者离开广场时，问一位放长龙风筝的刘姓老人：“你这风筝有多长？”他自豪地回答：“50米！”
