Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 3rd — (Reporters Wang Huitao and Yin Xuecheng) The famous Qinhuai River scenic area in Nanjing has added new attractions: the Jiangnan Gongyuan Historical Exhibition Hall and the Li Xiangjun Residence Exhibition Hall have recently opened to the public. The Jiangnan Gongyuan Historical Exhibition Hall is the first exhibition hall in China dedicated to the imperial examination system. Located at Fuzimiao, the Jiangnan Gongyuan was built during the Southern Song Dynasty in the fourth year of Qianyou (1168 AD). After the Ming Dynasty established its capital in Nanjing, the provincial examinations for Suzhou and Anhui, as well as the national examinations, were also held here. This precious historical site was destroyed during the early Republican period, with only the Mingyuan Tower and twenty-two Ming and Qing dynasty stone inscriptions remaining. To recreate the scene of the ancient imperial examinations, the Qinhuai District has restored the Gongyuan site, displaying over a hundred documents and photographs related to China's imperial examination system, and reconstructing forty examination rooms in their original style.

The Li Xiangjun Residence Exhibition Hall, renovated in honor of the famous Ming Dynasty courtesan Li Xiangjun, is located on the west side of the Dachen Temple. Li Xiangjun was one of the "Eight Beauties of Qinhuai" during the late Ming Dynasty and is admired for her loyalty and patriotism. The Li Xiangjun Residence Exhibition Hall covers an area of over five hundred square meters and is a three-section, two-story wooden structure from the Qing Dynasty. The main hall, Meixiang Tower, is flanked by side rooms and courtyards, adorned with calligraphy and paintings by famous artists. The rear courtyard features an elegant riverside hall, equipped with a tea house for traditional Chinese music and opera performances. Below the tower, there is a small dock for tourists to board boats and enjoy a cruise along the Qinhuai River.

    十里秦淮又添风采  两处遗址修葺一新
    新华社南京十月三日电　（记者王惠堂、殷学成）著名的南京秦淮风光带上又添新景——江南贡院历史陈列馆和李香君故居陈列馆最近正式对外开放。江南贡院历史陈列馆是我国第一所科举制度陈列馆。位于夫子庙的江南贡院，建于南宋孝宗乾道四年（公元一千一百六十八年）。明朝定都南京后，苏皖两省的乡试及全国的会试也曾在这里举行。这一珍贵历史遗迹毁于民国初期，现仅存明远楼和二十二块明清碑刻。为了再现昔日科举考试情景，秦淮区重整了贡院遗址，展出了一百多幅反映我国科举制度的文献资料、图片，并按原样修建了四十间号舍。
    为纪念明代著名歌妓李香君而整修一新的李香君故居陈列馆，坐落在夫子庙大成殿西侧。李香君是明末“秦淮八艳”之一，因坚贞爱国为世人赞赏。李香君故居陈列馆占地五百多平方米，是一座三进两层木结构的清代民居。正宅媚香楼两侧有厢房庭院，刻有名家字画，后院为精致的临水河厅，设有戏曲和民乐茶座，楼下设有小型码头，供游客乘船游览秦淮河。
