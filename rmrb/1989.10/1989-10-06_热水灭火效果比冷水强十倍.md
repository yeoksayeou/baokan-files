Hot water has a fire-fighting effect that is more than ten times stronger than cold water. According to a report in the Soviet Union's _Socialist Industry News_, at the beginning of this year, a fire broke out in the raw materials warehouse of a knitting factory in the Soviet Union. Firefighters used hot water to extinguish the blaze, and in just 9 minutes, the fire was completely subdued.

Investigations have shown that the fire-fighting effectiveness of boiling water is more than ten times greater than that of cold water. At the scene of the fire, one liter of hot water can achieve the same effect as 20 to 30 liters of cold water per second. Using boiling water to fight fires, five firefighters can accomplish the work of dozens of firefighters.

    热水灭火效果比冷水强十倍
    新华社莫斯科10月4日电　据苏联《社会主义工业报》报道，今年年初，苏联一家针织品厂原料仓库发生火灾，消防队员们改用热水灭火，仅用9分钟大火即被征服。
    调查表明，开水的灭火效果要比冷水高10多倍。在火灾现场，1立升的热水每秒钟所起的作用相当于20—30立升的冷水。用开水灭火，5名消防队员即可完成数十名消防队员的工作量。
