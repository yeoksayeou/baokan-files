Panama Accuses U.S. of Supporting Failed Coup
37 Coup Plotters Arrested

People's Daily, New York, October 4th. Reporter Liú Kāichéng reports: Panama's interim President Francisco Rodriguez held a press conference today in New York, stating, "The failed coup in Panama yesterday was orchestrated and supported by the U.S. government."

Rodriguez said there is evidence that the U.S. government supported a minority group in Panama attempting to seize power. The Panamanian government has obtained photographs showing U.S. military setting up barricades on several major roads to prevent Panamanian forces from entering the combat zone to counter the coup. These photographs and evidence will be released at an appropriate time.

Rodriguez also condemned the U.S. in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly yesterday for attempting to overthrow the Panamanian government through economic sanctions and other means. U.S. President Bush denied U.S. involvement in the failed coup in Panama yesterday. However, U.S. government officials admitted they had prior knowledge of the impending coup in Panama and hoped for Noriega's downfall.

Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, October 4th.

The Panama Defense Forces General Command issued a battle report this afternoon stating that after suppressing a military coup attempt by a group of officers on October 3rd, 37 officers have been arrested, including three members of the country's highest military command.

The three high-ranking officers arrested are Guillermo Rios, Colonel, Head of the Intelligence Bureau of the Defense Forces Command, Julio Yan, Colonel, Head of the Personnel Bureau, and Armando Gondola, Lieutenant Colonel, Head of the Coordination Bureau. These three were promoted to important positions by Defense Forces Commander Noriega after suppressing a previous coup in March 1988. They were all considered Noriega's close associates.

The battle report said that during the five-hour intense firefight, 10 coup plotters were killed (including Moises, the commander of the main force "Magpie Battalion"), 18 loyalist soldiers were injured, and three coup plotters and five civilians were injured.

    巴拿马指控美国支持未遂政变
    37名政变军官被捕
    本报联合国10月4日电  记者刘开宸报道：巴拿马临时总统弗兰西斯科·罗德里格斯今天在这里举行的记者招待会上指出，“巴拿马昨天发生的未遂政变是由美国政府扶植和支持的。”
    罗德里格斯说，有各种证据表明美国政府支持少数巴拿马人企图夺取政权的行动。巴拿马政府已获得的照片显示美国军队在几条大道上设置障碍，阻止巴拿马军队进入反击政变的战斗地区。这些照片和证据将在适当时候发表。
    罗德里格斯昨天在联合国大会的发言中谴责美国以经济制裁等方式企图推翻巴拿马政府。美国总统布什昨天否认美国卷入巴拿马未遂政变。但美国政府官员承认他们事先获悉巴拿马要发生政变事，并希望诺列加下台。
    新华社巴拿马城10月4日电　巴拿马国防军总司令部今天下午发布的战报说，3日平息了一批军官发动的军事政变之后，已逮捕37名军官，其中包括该国最高军事指挥部门的3名成员。
    被捕的3名高级军官是，国防军司令部情报局长吉列尔莫·王上校、人事局长胡利奥·扬上校和协调局局长阿尔曼多·贡多拉中校。这3人都是1988年3月平息了一次政变之后，被国防军司令诺列加提拔担任重要职务的。他们都曾被看作是诺列加的心腹。
    战报说，在长达5个小时的激烈交火中，10名政变分子丧生（其中包括此次政变主力“喜鹊营”营长莫伊塞斯少校），18名忠于诺列加的军人受伤，另有3名政变分子和5名市民受伤。
