The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has successfully assisted enterprises in clearing debts, with a total of 5.2 billion yuan in outstanding debts being resolved. This significant progress was reported by journalists Pan Gang and Li Erliang from Yinchuan.

On October 14, reporters Pan Gang and Li Erliang from Yinchuan reported that the Yinchuan Western Bearing Factory, which had previously struggled to collect overdue payments, managed to recover 6.8 million yuan from a factory in Lanzhou through the ICBC's acceptance drafts. During a three-day conference organized by the ICBC to help large and medium-sized enterprises clear overdue payments, a total of 5.2 billion yuan in inter-enterprise debts were successfully cleared among 5,000 key enterprises in the energy, transportation, raw materials, and profitable machinery and electronics sectors.

Since last year, due to factors such as excess demand over supply, unsecured construction funds, and increasing enterprise losses, inter-enterprise arrears have become increasingly severe nationwide. By early April this year, enterprises with accounts at the ICBC had accumulated 74.8 billion yuan in mutual arrears, with 34.7 billion yuan of this amount being cross-provincial/municipal arrears. Many enterprises were trapped in a "triangular debt" dilemma, severely hindering the normal operation of production and circulation. To implement the central government's rectification and adjustment policies, activate funds, and support the "national team" in normal production and operations, the ICBC began clearing inter-enterprise arrears in various regions starting from April. By the end of August, 18.9 billion yuan in arrears had been cleared.

To assist large and medium-sized enterprises in clearing cross-regional arrears, the ICBC leveraged its extensive network of branches to initiate a nationwide clearing effort using the bank's acceptance drafts, allowing enterprises to clear debts without physical presence. It is understood that this clearing effort, with the ICBC headquarters investing only 1.2 billion yuan in startup funds, successfully cleared 5.2 billion yuan in arrears, achieving a funding leverage ratio of 1:4.3. Prior to the conference, ICBC branches in 36 cities mobilized tens of thousands of personnel to conduct thorough investigations and preparations within enterprises.

A relevant ICBC official revealed that the current cross-provincial/municipal mutual arrears among enterprises with accounts at ICBC branches in municipalities, provincial capitals, and separately planned cities amount to approximately 15 billion yuan, accounting for about half of the system's total cross-provincial/municipal arrears. Due to various reasons, this clearing effort was limited to 5,000 key large and medium-sized enterprises, with the cleared amount accounting for only one-third of the total mutual arrears. The official expressed that the ICBC will continue to explore effective measures to help enterprises clear debts, aiming to alleviate the tight financial situation of enterprises and promote normal industrial production and commodity circulation under the premise of the central government's tight monetary policy and limited or no increase in loans.

    工商银行协助企业“清欠”
    52亿债务死结开始化解
    本报郑州10月14日电　记者潘岗、李而亮报道：多次派员催收欠款未能收到、被外欠款拖得奄奄一息的银川西北轴承厂，今天通过工商银行的承兑汇票，轻而易举地收回了兰州某厂680万元欠款。在为期3天的中国工商银行协助大中型企业清理拖欠货款会议上，全国5000户能源、交通、原材料工业企业以及效益好的机械电子企业间人欠、欠人的52亿元资金，得到了全部清理。
    去年以来，由于总需求超过总供给、基建资金不落实以及企业亏损增多等原因，全国企业间互相拖欠货款日趋严重。到今年4月初，在工商银行开户的工商企业互相拖欠达748亿元，其中有347亿元为跨省市拖欠。许多企业陷入“三角债”困境，严重阻碍了生产流通的正常进行。为了贯彻中央治理整顿方针，搞活资金，支持“国家队”正常生产、经营，今年4月起，各地工商银行先后在当地范围对大中型企业相互拖欠货款进行了清理，到8月末，已清理189亿元。
    为帮助大中型企业清理跨地区拖欠，中国工商银行发挥各地分行点多面广的结算优势，决定首次在全国范围利用系统内银行承兑汇票方式，“在企业不到场的情况下，代理企业进行清欠”。据了解，这次“清欠”，工商银行总行仅投入12亿元启动资金，就清理了52亿元的拖欠，收到“投1元搞活4.3元”的资金投入效益。会议前，36个城市工商银行动员了数以万计的人员，深入企业摸底调查，做了大量准备工作。
    中国工商银行有关负责同志透露，目前全国直辖市、省会城市、计划单列市工商银行开户企业间的跨省市相互拖欠150亿元左右，约占全系统跨省市拖欠总额的一半。由于诸多原因，这次清理只限5000 家大中型骨干企业，清理款只占相互拖欠总数的三分之一。他表示，工商银行今后还将继续探索行之有效的帮助企业“清欠”措施，以求在中央紧缩银根，不增或少增贷款的前提下，缓解企业资金紧张局面，促进工业生产和商品流通的正常进行。
