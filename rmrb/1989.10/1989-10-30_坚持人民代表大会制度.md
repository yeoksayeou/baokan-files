Edition: 6

Advocates of bourgeois liberalization fervently promote the capitalist system of separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, claiming it to be the most democratic system to prevent the abuse of power. They attempt to use this as a blueprint for political system reform in our country. In response, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has given a firm and clear answer: "We must persist with the system of people's congresses, not the American-style system of three separate powers."

The people's congress system is our country's fundamental political system, the best form of political structure that matches our country's political system of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. The superiority of the people's congress system lies in its full embodiment of the principle of popular sovereignty, reflecting the supremacy and omnipotence of the people's power, facilitating the people's role as masters of the country, and exercising the power to manage the state. Article 2 of our constitution states: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at various levels." The National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power, and local people's congresses at various levels are local organs of state power. The supremacy and omnipotence of the people's power are reflected in the supremacy and omnipotence of the power of the people's congresses. At the same time, the correct handling of the relationship between the unity and division of state power and the relationship between the central government and local governments, in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, mobilizes the enthusiasm of all parties and ensures the reasonable and effective operation of the state machinery. State power is unified and indivisible. Legislative power, administrative power, judicial power, and procuratorial power all belong to the state power organs, that is, the people's congresses. Legislative power is exercised by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, while administrative power, judicial power, and procuratorial power are granted by the state power organs to the administrative organs, judicial organs, and procuratorial organs respectively through legislation, and they are accountable to the state power organs. Legislative power is the foremost power, superior to other powers, and the source of all other powers. Other powers must be regulated by legislative power and are subject to its constraints, while also having relative independence. The principle of democratic centralism is reflected in the relationship between the central and local governments as follows: "The division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs shall be based on the principle of ensuring the unified leadership of the central government while fully mobilizing the initiative and enthusiasm of local governments." (Constitution, Article 3, Paragraph 4) "In areas where ethnic minorities live in compact communities, regional autonomy is practiced, and autonomous organs are established to exercise autonomy. All ethnic autonomous areas are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China." (Constitution, Article 4, Paragraph 3)

Our country's political structure effectively guarantees national unity and ethnic solidarity. The unity of state power is absolute and unconditional. Denying this unity is to deny the supremacy and omnipotence of the people's power, and there would be no reliable guarantee for national unity and independence. The division of state power and the division of functions and powers between the central and local governments are relative and conditional, and can be changed according to different situations and work needs. To maintain the unity of state power, it is necessary to uphold the principle of democratic centralism and the unity of the legal system, and to oppose all forms of separatism and anarchism.

A certain political system is a reflection of a certain economic system and a concentrated expression of class relations. Our country's establishment and persistence with the people's congress system is because this system is in line with our country's socialist class relations and the class composition of the people's political power, and is based on the political and moral unity of all ethnic groups in our country. In the long process of the Chinese revolution and construction, a broad patriotic united front has been formed, led by the Communist Party of China and participated in by various democratic parties and people's organizations, including all socialist laborers, patriots who support socialism, and patriots who support national unity. This has formed a new type of party system and party relations under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, which is a characteristic of our country's political life and an advantage. It is fundamentally different from the mutual deception, power struggles, and selfish interests of bourgeois parties and political forces. Under the people's congress system, members of the broad patriotic united front participate in the country's political life at different levels, in different forms, and to different degrees, discussing and deciding on state affairs. Our country's political situation is completely in line with the socialist economic base dominated by public ownership.

Our country's people's congress system is an inheritance and development of the democratic system of the Paris Commune and the Soviet democratic system led by Lenin, and a concrete application and Chinese form of the principle of combining legislative and executive powers.

The bourgeois system of separation of powers is the organizational form of bourgeois rule. It is in line with the class relations, party system, and private ownership economic base of capitalist countries. In short, it is a form of bourgeois dictatorship. Advocates of bourgeois liberalization strip the system of separation of powers of its historical and class content and promote it as an abstract idea, as if this system is applicable to both capitalist and socialist countries. The facts are not like this, and they cannot be like this. The emergence of the system of separation of powers has its historical conditions. Marx has given a scientific analysis of this: "In a certain country, at a certain period, the king, the nobility, and the bourgeoisie compete for power, and therefore, there, power is shared, and the dominant ideas there will be the theory of separation of powers, and people talk about separation of powers as an 'eternal law'." (Collected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 3, pp. 52-53) It can be seen that the system of separation of powers emerged as a result of the compromise between the bourgeoisie and feudal forces when the bourgeoisie first seized power and its strength was not yet strong, and it was determined by the balance of class forces. When the bourgeoisie completely seized power, or in some countries where the bourgeois revolution was more thorough and the bourgeoisie seized power from the beginning, this system adapted to the needs of internal strife and party struggles within the bourgeoisie and was adopted by most capitalist countries.

The system of separation of powers has always been advocated as a means of mutual checks and balances among powers to prevent the abuse of power, and this is also the place where it is most deceptive. Advocates of bourgeois liberalization also emphasize this point. It should be noted that the replacement of feudal absolutism by bourgeois separation of powers is indeed a progress. However, the distribution of power in the system of separation of powers is extremely imbalanced, and the power structure cannot truly achieve the goal of checks and balances. In reality, administrative power often exceeds legislative power and judicial power, while the checks and balances of legislative power and judicial power on administrative power are extremely limited, even non-existent. As Marx pointed out in discussing the situation in France: "The constitution grants actual power to the president while seeking to preserve spiritual power for the National Assembly. However, it goes without saying that legal provisions cannot create spiritual power, and the constitution negates itself in this regard." (Collected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 8, p. 137) Under this legal relationship, legislative power cannot prevent the expansion of administrative power and its infringement on the legitimate rights of the people. Therefore, Marx also pointed out: "In the face of administrative power, the people completely abandon their own will and submit to the command of others, to authority. Unlike legislative power, administrative power represents the people being ruled rather than self-government." (Collected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 8, p. 241) The administrative organs of capitalist countries not only have extensive discretionary powers without supervision but also, under the guise of delegated legislation, seize a large part of legislative power.

As for the relationship between administrative power and judicial power, the administrative organs of capitalist countries not only control the appointment of judges and the allocation of funds, allowing them to exercise macro-control outside of litigation, but also direct prosecutors to interfere with litigation at the micro-level. Therefore, Marx said that the bourgeois "judges have lost their apparent independence." (Collected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 17, p. 359)

The system of separation of powers has not only been criticized by Marxist classics but also opposed and ridiculed by many bourgeois scholars and politicians. They refer to the parliament as a "luxury" in politics, to the debates in the parliament as "empty talk," and to the disputes between legislative power and administrative power as "gambling with constitutional power." The utopian socialist Saint-Simon's view of the system of separation of powers, however, is quite insightful. Saint-Simon criticized France's "infatuation with the British constitution," believing that as long as the system of separation of powers is implemented, there will be peace in the world, unaware that the fundamental issue of the constitution is the resolution of the ownership problem. Indeed, when property is concentrated in the hands of capitalists and the proletariat has nothing, any separation of powers is irrelevant to them and cannot help them escape the plight of being exploited and oppressed.

We reject the system of separation of powers because this system does not suit our country's political system and is fundamentally opposed to the principle of democratic centralism. It cannot reflect the supremacy and omnipotence of the people's power. Because under the system of separation of powers, there is no omnipotent organ. The principle of democratic centralism, as well as the people's congress system based on the principle of democratic centralism, is closely related to people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Without democratic centralism, proletarian dictatorship cannot be consolidated." (Speech at the Enlarged Central Work Conference, January 30, 1962) Comrade Liu Shaoqi also pointed out: "The democratic centralism of the proletariat is the fundamental system of politics, economy, and culture in socialism. Without this democratic centralism, socialism cannot be built." (Selected Works of Liu Shaoqi, Vol. 2, p. 364) On the other hand, the system of separation of powers is associated with the bourgeois party system, political opposition, political speculation, the conspiracies of ambitious individuals, and the farce of elections every few years. If this system is implemented, it will damage the political unity and moral unity of all ethnic groups in our country, damage the party system of cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the new type of party relations, and lead to political strife, harming the fundamental interests of the people of our country.

Forty years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his essay "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," recounted how, since the Opium War, progressive Chinese people sought the truth of saving the country and the people from the West and hit a wall everywhere, and finally found Marxism-Leninism to guide the Chinese revolution and achieve victory. Comrade Mao Zedong summed up this period of history: "It was like this. The civilization of the Western bourgeoisie, bourgeois democracy, and the plan for a bourgeois republic all failed in the eyes of the Chinese people. Bourgeois democracy gave way to people's democracy led by the working class, and the bourgeois republic gave way to the people's republic." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 4, p. 1476) Forty years later, some people still attempt to establish a completely Westernized bourgeois republic and its system of separation of powers in China. These people have either forgotten or do not understand at all the history of the Chinese revolution over the past hundred years, and they close their eyes to the fact that socialist China is developing and growing stronger. Their arrogant attempt is nothing but a fantasy. The plan for a bourgeois democratic republic has failed in the past and is doomed to fail in the future.

We must persist with the people's congress system. The people's congress system is essentially superior, but it is not yet perfect, so its superiority has not been fully realized. To persist with the people's congress system, it is necessary to lead and step by step reform, develop, and perfect it. The most important thing is to implement the separation of party and government, establish and enhance the authority of the people's congresses, and fully play their role in the country's political life. At the same time, strengthen legal supervision, including direct supervision by the people's congresses and their standing committees and specialized legal supervision by the people's procuratorates, improve the state's legal supervision mechanism, and use the law to supervise officials and power. In addition, strengthen political discipline and audit supervision in administrative supervision, strengthen administrative discipline and financial discipline, prevent and eliminate corruption, and promote clean governance. To this end, it is necessary to truly establish the authority and dignity of the law, making the law a norm and criterion that everyone follows. The Party and the state are leading the people to do this, which is a fact that is evident to all.

　　坚持人民代表大会制度
　　王桂五
    鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，竭力宣扬资本主义的立法、行政、司法三权分立的制度，把它说成是制止权力专横的最民主的制度，并企图以此作为我国政治体制改革的蓝本。对此，邓小平同志给予了坚定而明确的回答：“我们要坚持实行人民代表大会的制度，而不是美国式的三权鼎立制度。”
    人民代表大会制度是我国的根本政治制度，是与我国以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国体相适应的最好的政体，即政权组织形式。人民代表大会制度的优越性，在于它充分体现了人民主权的原则，体现了人民权力的至上性和全权性，便于人民当家作主，行使管理国家的权力。我国宪法第2条规定：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使国家权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。”全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关，地方各级人民代表大会是地方国家权力机关。人民权力的至上性和全权性，表现为人民代表机关权力的至上性和全权性。同时，按照民主集中制的原则正确处理国家权力的统一和分工的关系、中央与地方的关系，以调动各方面的积极性，保证国家机器合理而有效地运转。国家的权力是统一的、不可分割的，立法权、行政权、审判权和检察权都属于国家权力机关即人民代表大会。立法权由全国人民代表大会和它的常务委员会行使，行政权、审判权和检察权由国家权力机关以立法的形式分别赋予行政机关、审判机关和检察机关行使，并对国家权力机关负责。立法权是各项权力中的第一权，高于其他权力，是其他各项权力的渊源。其他权力都要由立法权加以规定，受立法权的制约，同时又具有相对的独立性。民主集中制原则体现在中央和地方的关系上，则是“中央和地方的国家机构职权的划分，遵循在中央的统一领导下，充分发挥地方的积极性和主动性的原则。”（宪法第3条第4款）“各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治，设立自治机关，行使自治权。各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。”（宪法第4条第3款）
    我国的这种政体结构，有效地保障着国家的统一和民族的团结。国家权力的统一是绝对的、无条件的，否认这种统一就是否定人民权力的至上性和全权性，国家的统一和独立就没有可靠的保证。国家权力的分工和中央与地方职权的划分则是相对的、有条件的，根据形势的不同和工作的需要是可以变更的。为了维护国家权力的统一，必须维护民主集中制的原则和维护法制的统一，反对一切分散主义和无政府主义的思想和行为。
    一定的政治是一定的经济的反映，也是一定的阶级关系的集中表现。我国之所以建立并且坚持实行人民代表大会制度，是因为这一制度是同我国社会主义的阶级关系和人民政权的阶级构成相适应的，是建立在我国各族人民政治一致和道义一致的基础上的。在中国革命和建设的长期过程中，结成了由中国共产党领导的、有各民主党派和人民团体参加的，包括全体社会主义劳动者、拥护社会主义的爱国者和拥护祖国统一的爱国者的广泛的爱国统一战线，形成了中国共产党领导的多党合作的政党制度和新型的政党关系。这是我国政治生活的特色，也是我们的优势所在，根本不同于资产阶级政党和政治势力之间的尔虞我诈、争权夺利。在人民代表大会制度之下，广泛的爱国统一战线的成员，以不同的层次、不同的形式和程度参加到国家政治生活中来，商讨和决定国家的事务。我国的这种政治状况，同以公有制为主体的社会主义经济基础是完全相适应的。
    我国的人民代表大会制度，是对巴黎公社民主制和列宁领导创建的苏维埃民主制的继承和发展，是议行合一原则的具体运用和中国化的形式。
    资产阶级的三权分立制度，是资产阶级政权的组织形式，它和资本主义国家的阶级关系、政党制度、私有制的经济基础是相适应的，说到底，它是资产阶级专政的形式。鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，抽去了三权分立制度的时代内容和阶级内容，把它当作抽象的思想加以宣扬，似乎这种制度既适用于资本主义国家，也适用于社会主义国家。事实并不是这样，而且也不可能是这样。三权分立制度的产生是有它的历史条件的。对此，马克思早就作过科学的分析：“在某一国家里，某个时期王权、贵族和资产阶级争夺统治，因而，在那里统治是分享的，那里占统治地位的思想就会是关于分权的学说，人们把分权当作‘永恒的规律’来谈论。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第3卷第52页至第53页）由此可见，三权分立制度的产生，是在资产阶级掌握政权的初期当它的力量还不够强大时与封建势力妥协的结果，是由阶级力量对比所决定的。当资产阶级完全掌握了政权，或者在有的资产阶级革命比较彻底，资产阶级一开始就完全掌握了政权的国家里，这种制度又适应了资产阶级内部纷争和党派斗争的需要，而被多数资本主义国家所采用。
    三权分立制度一向是以权力之间的互相制衡，防止权力的专横相标榜的，这也是它比较能够迷惑人的地方。鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，对此也竭力加以渲染。应当看到，由资产阶级的分权代替封建主义的专权，的确是一个进步。但是三权分立制度中权力的分配是极不平衡的，权力的结构并不能真正达到制衡的目的。实际情况是行政权力往往超过了立法权和司法权，而立法权和司法权对行政权的制衡则是极其有限的，甚至是有名无实的。正如马克思在谈到法国的情况时所指出的：“宪法把实际的权力授给了总统，而力求为国民议会保证精神上的权力。可是，不用说，法律条文不可能创造精神上的权力，宪法就在这方面也是自己否定自己。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第8卷第137页）在这种法律关系支配下，立法权并不能阻止行政权力的膨胀及其对人民合法权益的侵犯。所以马克思又指出：“在行政权力面前，国民完全放弃了自己的意志，而服从于他人意志的指挥，服从于权威。和立法权力相反，行政权力所表现的是国民受人统治而不是国民自治。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第8卷第241页）资本主义国家的行政机关不仅拥有广泛的自由裁量权而不受监督，而且在委任立法的名义下夺取了很大一部分立法权。
    至于行政权和司法权的关系，资本主义国家的行政机关既掌握着法院的人事任命权和经费开支权，可以在诉讼之外进行宏观上的控制；又可以指挥检察官，在诉讼之内进行微观上的干预。所以马克思说，资产阶级的“法官已失去其表面的独立性”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第17卷第359页）。
    三权分立制度不仅受到马克思主义经典作家的批判，而且也受到不少资产阶级学者和政治家的反对和嘲笑。他们把议会称作政治上的“奢侈品”，把议会中的辩论称作“清谈”，把立法权和行政权的争吵称作“宪法力量的赌博”。而空想社会主义者圣西门对三权分立制度的看法，倒是颇有见地的。圣西门批评法国“醉心于英国的宪法”，以为只要实行三权分立，就会天下太平，殊不知宪法的根本问题是解决所有制问题。的确，当财产集中于资本家手中，而无产阶级一无所有的时候，任何分权，都是与他们不相干的，都不能使他们摆脱受剥削、受压迫的困境。
    我们拒绝三权分立制度，是因为这种制度不适合我国的国体，而且同民主集中制的原则是根本对立的，它不能体现人民权力的至上性和全权性。因为在三权分立制度下，没有一个全权的机关。民主集中制原则，以及基于民主集中制原则的人民代表大会制度，同人民民主专政和社会主义制度是密切相关的。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“没有民主集中制，无产阶级专政不可能巩固。”（《在扩大的中央工作会议上的讲话》1962年1月30日）刘少奇同志也指出：“无产阶级的民主集中制，是社会主义政治、经济、文化各方面的根本制度。没有这种民主集中制，就不能建设社会主义。”（《刘少奇选集》下卷第364页）另一方面，三权分立制度又是同资产阶级的政党制度、政治上的反对派、政客的投机、野心家的阴谋、几年一次的选举闹剧等等联系在一起的。如果实行这种制度，将会损害我国各族人民政治上的团结和道义上的一致，损害中国共产党领导下的多党合作制度和新型的政党关系，而导致政治纷争的局面，危害我国人民的根本利益。
    40年前，毛泽东同志在《论人民民主专政》一文中曾经追述过自鸦片战争以后，先进的中国人向西方寻求救国救民的真理而处处碰壁的情形，最后才找到了马克思列宁主义指导中国革命取得了胜利。毛泽东同志总结这一段历史说：“就是这样，西方资产阶级的文明，资产阶级的民主主义，资产阶级共和国的方案，在中国人民的心目中，一齐破了产。资产阶级的民主主义让位给工人阶级领导的人民民主主义，资产阶级共和国让位给人民共和国。”（《毛泽东选集》第4卷第1476页）40年后，仍然有人企图在中国建立完全西方化的资产阶级共和国及其三权分立制度，这些人完全忘记了或者根本不了解一百多年来中国革命的历史，也闭眼不看社会主义中国正在发展壮大的事实。他们的狂妄企图，只能是一种幻想。资产阶级民主共和国的方案过去在中国行不通，今后也是注定要失败的。
    我们要坚持人民代表大会制度。人民代表大会制度本质上是优越的，但是还不够完善，以致它的优越性未能充分发挥出来。为了坚持人民代表大会制度，必须有领导、有步骤地对它加以改革、发展和完善。其中最重要的是实行党政分开，树立和增强人民代表机关的权威，充分发挥它在国家政治生活中的作用。同时加强法律监督，包括人大及其常委的直接监督和人民检察院的专门法律监督，健全国家的法律监督机制，以法制官，以法制权。再加上行政监督中的政纪监督和审计监督，强化行政纪律和财政纪律，防止和消除腐败现象，推进廉政建设。为此目的，必须切实树立法律的权威和尊严，使法律成为人人遵守的规范和准绳。党和国家正在领导人民这样做，这是有目共睹的事实。
