When the topic of the Temple of Confucius comes up, people immediately think of the countless memorial temples scattered throughout the cities and towns across the country. When it comes to the authentic Kong Family Temple, most people would only think of Qufu. Little do they know that there is another one in the south— the Kong Family Temple in Quzhou, Zhejiang.

This is not surprising given the general lack of knowledge among the Chinese people. It is rather peculiar that even someone like me, a native of Quzhou, spent my entire middle school years in the prefectural city where the temple is located, but only recently learned about the true identity and value of this dilapidated building complex. This shows how much it has been neglected and buried!

This famous site is a product of the Southern Song Dynasty. According to records, in the second year of the Jianyan era (1128 AD), Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty, Zhao Gou, was forced to flee south to Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou) due to the advancing Jin troops. At that time, Kong Duanyou, the 48th generation descendant of Confucius who had inherited the title of "Yuan Sheng Gong," fled south with his clan members, carrying with them the ancestral treasures—wooden statues of Confucius and his wife, Yuan Guan. The following year, Emperor Gaozong approved the construction of a family temple for the Kong clan in Quzhou. Due to the chaos of war, it was not until the first year of the Baoyou era (1253 AD) under Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty that funds amounting to 360,000 strings of cash were allocated to begin construction on the northeastern corner of Quzhou City, by the side of Lake Ling, mimicking the ancestral temple in Qufu. The Kong clan lived here for six generations, and by the 53rd generation, the Yuan Dynasty had established control over the country. The Yuan Emperor wanted to unify the Kong clans of the north and south, so he ordered Kong Zhu, the 53rd generation descendant, to return to Qufu. However, Kong Zhu submitted a memorial to the court, stating that there were already five generations of his ancestors' tombs in Quzhou, and he could not bear to abandon them. He also expressed his willingness to relinquish the hereditary title of "Yuan Sheng Gong" to his cousin Kong Zhi in the north. The Yuan Emperor was greatly pleased and praised, "He would rather defy honor than defy his kin, truly a descendant of a sage." From then on, the Kong clans of the north and south were separated. The southern clan, having lost its title, gradually declined in social status, becoming commoners. During the Ming Dynasty, they even had their sacrificial fields confiscated by the government. It was not until the 59th generation descendant, Kong Yansheng, that the clan was again recognized by the court, being granted the title of "Hanlin Academy Five Classics Scholar," a title that was hereditary, but still far inferior to the "Yuan Sheng Gong" of the northern clan. In 1935, the then Chinese government announced the abolition of all feudal titles, treating the descendants of the Kong clans of the north and south equally. The direct male heir of the Kong clan in Quzhou, like that in Qufu, was granted the title of "Ritual Official." The last "Ritual Official" of the southern clan in Quzhou was Kong Xiangkai (now the manager of a gold mine under the Ministry of Metallurgy), who was appointed to this "official" position at the age of 9 in 1948, under the supervision of the Quzhou Pacification Public Office Director Tang Enbo. This shows that it was still feudal in nature. Currently, the descendants of this southern branch of the Kong clan in the Quzhou area number in the thousands.

Quzhou is located in the southwest of Zhejiang and has been a strategic location for military campaigns throughout history. Therefore, the southern Kong Temple has been repeatedly destroyed by wars, and its location has changed several times. The current site, located on Xinqiao Street in the eastern part of the city, covers an area of 11 mu and is mainly a remnant of the Qing Dynasty. The individual buildings incorporate the style of the Qing Dynasty, while the overall layout imitates that of Qufu. In recent years, the government has allocated a large sum of money to restore the temple to its original appearance. The "ruined temple" of my past has finally been renovated and now serves as a key cultural and tourist attraction, welcoming visitors from home and abroad.

### 衢州孔氏家庙今夕谈

　　衢州孔氏家庙今夕谈
　　叶廷芳
    提起孔庙，人们会立刻想到那遍布全国大小城镇的成百上千的纪念性文庙；提起正宗的孔氏家庙，恐怕一般人也只会想到曲阜，殊不知南方也有一处——浙江衢州孔氏家庙。
    这不怪国人孤陋寡闻。说来不免令人蹊跷，就是像我这样的道地的衢州人，整个中学年代都在孔庙所在的这座府城里度过，但知道这个破旧建筑群的真实身份及其价值的，还是近年来的事，可见它的被冷落、被埋没有多深！
    这处名胜，是南宋年代的产物。据记载：建炎二年（即公元1128年），宋高宗赵构迫于金兵的进逼，举朝南迁临安（今杭州），当时已袭封为“衍圣公”的孔子第48代孙孔端友遂与族人携传世家宝——孔子及元官夫人楷木像随驾南逃，落脚于衢州。翌年，高宗御准孔宗在这里兴建家庙。由于兵荒马乱，直到宝祐元年（1253年）宋理宗手上，才拨钱36万缗，着手在衢州城的东北隅菱湖畔兴土木，缩仿曲阜祖庙建造殿庑。孔氏在这里传宗六世，至53世时，元朝已在全国定局，元世祖欲统一孔氏南北二宗，遂诏孔氏53代孙孔洙遣回曲阜，但孔洙上奏朝廷，申述已有五代先祖之庐墓在衢，弃之不忍，并表示愿将世袭衍圣公这一封号让与北宗的族弟孔治，元世祖大悦，赞曰：“宁违荣而不违亲，真圣人后也。”自此，孔氏南北分宗。南宗因失去爵位，社会地位日衰，沦为平民，在明代，甚至一度连祭田都被抄没入官。至59世孙孔彦绳时，才又被朝廷重视，册封其为“翰林院五经博士”，子孙世袭，但比起北宗的衍圣公，地位悬殊。1935年，当时的中国政府宣布废除一切封建爵号，对南、北宗孔氏后裔一视同仁，衢州的孔氏嫡长孙与曲阜的一样，都被授予“奉祀官”衔。衢州南宗的最后一位奉祀官是孔祥楷（现为冶金部所属一个金矿的矿长），他于1948年在衢州绥靖公署主任汤恩伯的主持下，被委任为这一“官”职时才9岁，可见仍是封建性的。现南宗这一脉的孔氏后裔在衢州这一带约有数千人。
    衢州地处浙西南，为历代兵家必争之地，故南宗孔庙的建筑屡毁于兵燹，庙址亦几经更易。现存位于城东新桥街的这座占地11亩的建筑群主要是清代的遗物，其单体建筑融进了清代的风格，总体布局则是仿曲阜的。近年来，人民政府拨出巨款对孔庙按照原来的样式进行修缮。这座在我昔日心目中的“破庙”终于焕然一新，作为重点文物旅游点接待海内外游客。
