Edition: 8

The series of books "One Day of Martial Law," initiated by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army and edited and published by the PLA Literature and Art Publishing House, will soon be available to readers. This two-volume set, totaling 600,000 words, faithfully recounts the dramatic events that took place in Beijing during a recent period.

The most notable feature of this book is its authenticity. The works describe the true historical moments experienced by soldiers and police officers from various levels of the martial law troops.

For example, Colonel Ai Husheng of a certain unit led his team through rain and storm to Beijing Station. Despite facing attacks with bricks and stones, they marched in unison to Tiananmen Square, displaying the dignity and might of the soldiers to the people of the motherland. Ai Husheng's account, "Salute, Tiananmen," based on his personal experiences, is grand and inspiring.

Li Xiyue, a staff member of a certain unit, wrote "Mother's Tears," a deeply moving piece. The story tells of an elderly woman from a rural area who, after seeing her son injured on television, traveled thousands of miles to Beijing to visit him in the hospital. To avoid causing trouble for the unit, the old woman took a quick glance at her son and silently left. She did not shed a tear in front of her son. Her tears flowed silently in a corner of the train station...

"The 96,000 Steamed Buns" is a song of praise for the deep bond between the military and the people. After receiving a call for help from the martial law troops, the military supply leadership group of Daxing County quickly organized people to make steamed buns. The employees of all six state-owned restaurants in the county were mobilized to overcome numerous difficulties and quickly made 96,000 steamed buns.

Another feature of the book is the diversity of its authors and the richness of its content. The authors include eight generals such as military commanders, political commissars, and logistics department heads, thirteen deputy military commanders and regiment commanders with the rank of major general, as well as a large number of grassroots cadres, soldiers, public security officers, and local government officials. The content covers everything from the imposition of martial law to the advance on key targets in the capital, from the seizure of weapons at Xidan and Liubukou to the clearing operations at Tiananmen Square, from the guidance of armed forces to the support of municipal and county commercial departments, from medical teams' rescue efforts to logistical support.

The works are written in a simple and vivid style, making them highly readable.

"The One Day of Martial Law" series is a vivid and moving account of the martial law period, a valuable historical record. Whether you view it from any angle, reading this book will be deeply moving, with its strong emotional appeal, intimate and straightforward event descriptions, and memorable details.

　　留下历史的真实
　　——简介《严戒一日》
    由解放军总政文化部发起征文，解放军文艺出版社编辑出版的《戒严一日》丛书，近日就要与读者见面了。这部分上下两集共60万字的作品，忠实地记述了前一时期发生在首都北京的那场惊心动魄的事件始末。
    该书的一个最大特点，就是事件和情节的真实性。作品记述的是由戒严部队各级官兵、公安武警指战员亲身经历的真实的历史瞬间。
    如某部上校团长艾虎生，率团队风雨兼程赶到北京站，他们迎着砖石瓦块的袭击，迈着正步走到天安门广场，使军人的英姿威武地展现在祖国人民面前，艾虎生同志根据自己的亲身经历写就的《敬礼，天安门》，气势浩荡，令人热血奔涌。
    某部干事李西岳的《母亲的泪》，真切感人。该文叙述了这样一个故事：一位农村老妈妈，从电视上看到了儿子受伤的情景，迢迢千里赶到北京儿子所在的医院探望，为了不给部队添麻烦，老妈妈看了一眼儿子又悄悄离开部队。在儿子面前，她没掉一滴泪。她的泪只是默默地流在火车站一隅……
      《九万六千个包子》更是一曲军民鱼水情谊的颂歌。大兴县军供领导小组接到戒严部队的求援呼吁后，迅速组织人力抢包包子，全县国营六家饭店职工紧急动员，克服重重困难，一口气包了九万六千个包子。
    该书的另一个特点是作者的广泛性和内容的丰富性。参加写作的，有少将衔的军长、政委、后勤部长8人，大校衔的副军长、师长13人，有广大的基层干部和士兵，也有公安干警和地方国家干部。从内容上看，从戒严之日起到向首都重要目标开进，从西单六部口抢军火到天安门广场的清场行动，从武装部门带路到市县商业部门的支援，从医疗队的救护到后勤保障，都有涉及和描绘。
    作品文风朴素，叙述生动，具有较强的可读性。
    《戒严一日》丛书是一部生动感人的戒严纪实，是一部珍贵的历史资料，无论你站在哪种角度上，读这部书，都会被书中强烈的感情色彩，亲切、质朴的事件陈述，令人回味的细节画面所感染、吸引。
