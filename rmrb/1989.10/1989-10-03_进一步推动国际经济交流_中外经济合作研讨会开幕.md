On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), prominent figures from the financial and business sectors of 15 countries and regions gathered in Beijing today to participate in the Sino-Foreign Economic Cooperation Seminar hosted by the company. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and CITIC Chairman Rong Yiren delivered speeches at the conference.

Tian Jiyun warmly welcomed the domestic and foreign guests to this meaningful event. He said that over the past 10 years, CITIC has made significant achievements in international financial cooperation, investment, technology introduction, trade expansion, consulting services, and talent cultivation. It has developed extensive cooperation with many countries and regions and has become an important window for China's foreign economic work. He pointed out that today, international economic ties are becoming increasingly close. China's development cannot be separated from the world, and the world's development also cannot do without China's participation. In the process of rectifying the economic environment and economic order, China will continue to implement the policy of reform and opening up and revitalizing the economy. Effective reform and opening-up policies and measures will remain unchanged. Many far-sighted financiers and businesspeople from around the world are actively developing cooperation with China, hoping that this cooperation will be maintained for the long term and achieve even better and greater results.

Rong Yiren stated that it is hard to imagine that the world economy could achieve sustained and stable progress with only competition and no cooperation. He hopes that through this seminar, Sino-foreign economic cooperation can be elevated to a new level.

The chairman of the Dutch company Philips, Mr. Dyk, the president of the Japan-China Economic Association, Mr. Kawai Ryōichi, the president of the National Committee on United States-China Relations, Mr. Sullivan, the chairman of the American global conglomerate and former U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. Alexander Haig, the chairman of the board of directors of the British Jardine Matheson Group, Mr. John K. McKinnon, and the chairman of the board of directors of the West German Westmark Company, Mr. Weiss, along with officials from the Chinese government, delivered speeches at the seminar.
