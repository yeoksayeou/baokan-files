Since the start of the new semester, the majority of students have studied the documents and related materials from the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party, reflecting on the 50-day turmoil. Their ideological understanding has improved to varying degrees. This is a welcome progress. However, some students have not yet completely freed themselves from the previous extreme mindset and still harbor some confusion and bewilderment. This is also a normal phenomenon. The reason these students lost their way during the turmoil and still cannot untie some of their ideological "knots" is not only because their stance has not yet truly changed, but also because their thinking methods have many biases. Therefore, striving to master scientific thinking methods is very important for distinguishing right from wrong and learning lessons.

In "On Contradiction," Comrade Mao Zedong warned us: "When studying problems, avoid subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality." However, some students in this turmoil precisely fell into these "avoidances" and displayed them quite fully. This is a major reason why students lost their composure, were deceived, and made mistakes, and it is worth serious reflection.

Do Not Become a "Mad Piano"

Subjectivity is not knowing how to objectively view problems with a materialist perspective. In "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," Lenin, quoting from Diderot's works, ridiculed subjectivism: "There was a moment of madness when a piano with feelings thought it was the only piano in the world, and the entire harmony of the universe occurred within it." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 14, p. 26) Due to the long-term influence of erroneous trends such as bourgeois liberalization, some students' minds have been infected with egocentrism and subjectivism, which have swelled up during the 50-day turmoil. In this "moment of madness," they were like that piano, thinking they were everything, and everything was contained within their subjective selves. They believed that their voices represented the entire harmony of the universe. Therefore, they only believed in their subjective feelings, regardless of whether these feelings matched objective reality; they only acted according to their subjective will, regardless of the objective consequences; they only listened to flattering words and did not want to hear honest advice, regardless of whether it was malicious incitement or sincere concern; they thought whatever they said or did was "right," regardless of whether these actions were legal. This subjectivist thinking method has a strong selectivity towards external information, rejecting all information that does not match subjective feelings, and only selecting information that matches subjective tastes. It is like a "self-designed" "circle," trapping one's thoughts in a circular orbit centered on "self," unable to calmly, rationally, and objectively observe things and think about problems. As a result, the ability to distinguish between right and wrong is lost. When the "April 26" editorial was published, some students, upon hearing the word "turmoil," immediately reflexively thought it was directed at the majority of students. Their logic at the time was: because I subjectively do not want to create turmoil, therefore objectively there is no turmoil, so the editorial saying to "oppose turmoil" I must oppose the editorial. Despite the Party and the government repeatedly explaining that only a few people with ulterior motives were causing the turmoil, and repeatedly affirming that the vast majority of students had good intentions, they still could not accept it. They only believed in their preconceived "first impression," and did not even bother to carefully read what the editorial actually said. They simply followed their self-righteous "feelings," how could they not make mistakes? To correctly understand the world and achieve victory in work, one must make the subjective conform to the objective. However, the subjectivist thinking method is to separate the subjective from the objective. In the history of our Party, the several instances of rightist or "leftist" errors, from the perspective of epistemology, are characterized by the separation of the subjective and the objective, and the separation of cognition and practice. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong, in "Reform Our Study," regarded subjectivism as "the great enemy of the Communist Party, the great enemy of the working class, the great enemy of the people, and the great enemy of the nation." Through studying history, students have some understanding of the harm that subjectivism has caused to China's revolutionary and construction causes. Unfortunately, many students have not learned from history but instead admire the absurd views that have been prevalent in recent years, which advocate egocentrism and subjectivism. Unknowingly, they have allowed this "great enemy" to infiltrate their minds and reflect in their actions during this turmoil, leading to mistakes. This is a profound lesson.

Not Recognizing the True Face of Mount Lu, Because One Is Within the Mountain

The famous Song Dynasty poet Su Shi wrote a poem titled "Inscription on the West Forest Wall": "From the side, it looks like a peak; from afar, it looks like a ridge. One does not recognize the true face of Mount Lu, because one is within the mountain." Starting from a description of the scenery, it reveals profound philosophy, worth pondering, and can be used to illustrate one-sidedness in cognition. One-sidedness is not knowing how to view problems comprehensively, only seeing the part and not the whole, only seeing the trees and not the forest. This turmoil was fierce and rapidly changing, with several contradictions intertwined, making the situation extremely complex, like Mount Lu shrouded in clouds and mist. Looking from any side or angle, one cannot see the whole picture. Many students did not "recognize the true face of Mount Lu" and could not see the true nature of this turmoil, precisely because they were caught up in it, "within the mountain." They were surrounded by the chaos of the turmoil and reactionary propaganda, only able to observe and feel a very small part of the situation, unable to see the overall situation and complex background. This inevitably led to one-sidedness. For example, some students participated in hunger strikes or sit-ins at Tiananmen Square, listening all day to the slanderous broadcasts of the "High Self-Autonomy Federation," seeing only the crowd around them, with single information and narrow vision. The longer they stayed, the deeper they were poisoned. In this partial "small world," they could neither see the evil plot of the enemy to long-term occupy Tiananmen Square nor feel the strong indignation of the people of all ethnic groups nationwide towards this "occupation." As a result, they thought they were participating in a so-called "magnificent patriotic democratic movement," but in reality, they were confused and used as political hostages by the organizers of the turmoil. Only after learning and understanding the entire process of this turmoil's brewing, occurrence, and development, and understanding the complex background of the international "big climate" and domestic "small climate," could they possibly see the nature of this turmoil and the true face of the troublemakers from a global perspective. As one student reflected on thinking methods, "It seems that to recognize the nature of this turmoil and one's own weaknesses, one needs to 'jump off the car and climb back on.'” The meaning is that only by jumping off the car of turmoil can one see its turbulent trajectory; only by "climbing back on," that is, putting oneself "in it," can one recognize one's own problems. This thinking method of viewing problems from both the global and local perspectives overcomes one-sidedness in cognition.

It is worth noting that in recent years, those who have insisted on the bourgeois liberalization stance, while vigorously promoting the capitalist world of the West, have seized on partial and individual phenomena to vigorously vilify the Party's leadership and the socialist system. Using the one-sided, idealist method of attacking one point and not considering the rest, and exaggerating as much as possible, they have deceived some young students, causing them to lose faith in the Party and socialism, fostering a pro-Western and centrifugal tendency, and being led by the nose by the organizers of the turmoil in this turmoil. As some students have said: "In recent years, our minds have been full of social problems, and our eyes have been fixed on the dark side of society, which inevitably leads to mistakes."

Being Deceived by Surface Phenomena and Illusions Is Most Dangerous

Many students often view problems in a simplified and superficial manner, not good at seeing through phenomena to grasp the essence. In this turmoil, some students, with their extreme emotions, "followed their feelings," roughly and superficially seeing some surface phenomena, some of which were illusions, and rashly concluded, even believing and spreading absurd rumors without analysis and verification, blindly "following the rumors." They did not know that feelings can only solve surface problems, "illusions can blind the eyes," and rumors can "kill people." Especially when the enemy presents illusions and covers up the truth, it is easier to be deceived. For example, when the organizers of the turmoil implemented the "grieving soldiers" strategy on April 22, staging the so-called "long kneeling petition"; when the slogans of the April 27 parade suddenly changed; and when the hunger strike was abruptly announced on May 19 despite knowing in advance that martial law would be imposed, many students were deceived by the illusions, unable to see their "retreat to advance" and "defend to attack" evil intentions, let alone see the essence of this struggle. Instead, they pushed the responsibility onto the Party and the government. This shows that if one does not think deeply about the various phenomena seen, without "removing the coarse and taking the fine, removing the false and retaining the true, from this to that, from surface to essence," it is very difficult to see through the phenomena to grasp the essence.

Marxism holds that any phenomenon is a unity of essence and phenomenon. The essence refers to the internal connections of things, determined by the internal contradictions of things, especially the principal aspect of the principal contradiction; the phenomenon refers to the external form and external connections of things, which are the external manifestations of the essence. The essence and phenomenon are unified, but the phenomenon is not the essence, and the essence and its manifestation are not always consistent. Illusions are a distorted and inverted manifestation of the essence of things. In a society where class struggle still exists today, to recognize the essence of major social events, one must use the method of class analysis. Only by using the method of class analysis can one more easily recognize that this turmoil and the subsequent counter-revolutionary rebellion are essentially evil acts aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system and establishing a bourgeois republic in China. Similarly, only by using the method of class analysis can one see the reactionary faces of traitors like Fang Lizhi, Yan Jiaqi, and Wu'erkaixi, see the bourgeois essence of the so-called "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights" they vigorously advocate, and also understand their inevitable outcome of becoming national traitors. It must be admitted that in recent years, our propaganda work has paid too little attention to the viewpoint of class struggle and the method of class analysis, while views that blur class struggle, such as the "convergence" and "fusion" of the two social systems, have become rampant. This has caused many students to have weak class consciousness and a lack of enemy awareness, not knowing what class analysis is. As a result, in this turmoil, many students were oblivious to the class struggle and the armed class enemies happening around them, indifferent, and instead saw the bad leaders of the "High Self-Autonomy Federation" as student "leaders," and saw Fang Lizhi, Yan Jiaqi, and others as youth "mentors." Consequently, they were "led" into the turmoil and "guided" into the wrong path. This bloody lesson must never be forgotten.

Master the Key of Wisdom: Marxist Philosophy

The above brief discussion on the relationship between the subjective and the objective, the global and the local, and the essence and the phenomenon is basic common sense of Marxist philosophy. These common senses students have learned in high school and university, and their exam scores may have been good. However, it must be admitted that many students have only learned for the sake of passing exams, memorizing some concepts by rote, and returning them to the teacher after the exam; even if they still remember some points, they do not use or do not intend to use them. In addition, the trend of denigrating and negating Marxism that has been rampant in recent years has caused great confusion in thought, breaching the thought dikes of many students. Thus, it is not surprising that they failed in the practical test of reality. Marxist philosophy is the most scientific and complete worldview and methodology that humanity has ever had, a "great tool of cognition." It can guide us to grasp the essence in the complex contradictions, grasp the direction in the ever-changing development of things, and find solutions in various difficulties. It is the ideological weapon and action guide for the proletariat and the broad masses of the people in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation.

Our famous scientist Qian Xuesen wrote an article titled "Wisdom and Marxist Philosophy" (published in "Philosophical Research," Issue 2, 1987), sharing his personal experience. In the article, he said: "During my time abroad, I did not have a good opportunity to study Marxist philosophy, and I only gained some insights from experience and lessons in my work; such as from what angle to view problems, and what to do when encountering difficulties. At that time, I thought these were my insights. After returning to the socialist motherland, I had the opportunity to seriously study the works of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and I found that my insights on scholarship, compared to Marxist philosophy, were like a few small bubbles in the sea, not worth mentioning!" He then detailed what wisdom is and how to explore practical and effective ways to cultivate wisdom from the essence of wisdom. His deep feeling is: to have wisdom, one must understand and be able to use Marxist philosophy to observe and analyze the objective world. I hope students can read this article by Old Qian and benefit from it, thereby seriously studying Marxist philosophy and striving to master the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism. This way, one can distinguish the direction and right from wrong in class struggle; and in work and research, one can create and make progress. This is greatly beneficial for young students to better "become a person" and "succeed" faster.

    科学的思想方法帮你反思
    ——再同大学生们谈心
    清华大学  宗元
   新学期开学以来，广大同学通过学习党的十三届四中全会文件和有关材料，对50天的风波进行回顾与反思，思想认识都有不同程度的提高。这是一个可喜的进步。但有些同学还未完全从当时的偏激心态中解脱出来，仍存有某些迷惘和困惑。这也是正常现象。这些同学之所以在风波中迷失方向而且至今一些思想“扣子”还解不开，除了立场尚未真正转变之外，他们的思维方式也有诸多偏颇。因此，努力掌握科学的思想方法，对于分清是非吸取教训也是很重要的。
    毛泽东同志在《矛盾论》中告诫我们：“研究问题，忌带主观性、片面性和表面性。”而有些同学在这场风波中对事物的认识恰恰犯了此“忌”，而且显露得相当充分。这是同学们头脑发热、受骗上当、做出错事的一大原因，值得认真记取。
    切莫成为“发疯的钢琴”
    主观性，就是不知道用唯物的观点客观地看问题。列宁在《唯物主义与经验批判主义》一书中，曾从狄德罗的著作引来一段话以讽喻主观主义：“有过一个发疯的时刻，有感觉的钢琴以为它是世界上仅有的一架钢琴，宇宙的全部和谐都发生在它身上。”（《列宁全集》第14卷第26页）由于多年来资产阶级自由化等错误思潮的毒害，一些同学的头脑中滋长了唯我意识和主观主义，并在50天的风波中膨胀起来。他们在这个“发疯的时刻”，就像那架钢琴一样，以为自己就是一切，而一切都包含在自己的主观里，认为自己发出的声音代表了宇宙的全部和谐。因此，只相信自己的主观感觉，而不管这种感觉是否符合客观实际；只凭着自己的主观意愿行事，而不管这种意愿会带来什么客观效果；只爱听顺耳之言不愿听逆耳忠告，而不管是恶意煽动还是真心爱护；自己怎么说怎么干都觉“有理”，而不管这些言行是否合法，如此等等。这种主观主义的思想方法，对外部信息有很强的选择性，排斥一切不符合主观感觉的信息，只选择符合主观感觉口味的信息，好像一个“自我设计”的“怪圈”，把自己的思想认识禁锢在“以我为中心”的环形轨道上，无法冷静、理智、客观地观察事物、思考问题，从而丧失了分辨大是大非的能力。当《人民日报》“4·26”社论一播发，有些同学一听到“动乱”二字，就马上条件反射似地认为是针对广大同学的。他们当时的思维逻辑是：因为我主观上不想搞动乱，所以客观上就不存在动乱，因此社论说要“反对动乱”我就要反对社论。尽管此后党和政府多次说明，搞动乱的只是极少数别有用心的人，一再肯定绝大多数同学有着善良愿望，但他们就是听不进去。他们只相信自己先入为主的“第一感觉”，连社论究竟是怎么说的也不愿仔细地看一看，只跟着自以为是的“感觉”走，怎么能不犯错误？人们要想正确地认识世界，取得工作的胜利，必须使主观符合客观。而主观主义的思想方法，则是主观脱离客观。在我党历史上发生的几次右倾或“左”倾错误，从认识论上讲，都是以主观与客观相分裂、以认识和实践相分离为特征的。所以毛泽东同志在《改造我们的学习》中曾把主观主义看作“是共产党的大敌，是工人阶级的大敌，是人民的大敌，是民族的大敌”。同学们通过学习历史，对主观主义给中国革命和建设事业所造成的危害是有所认识的。但遗憾的是，不少同学并没有以史为鉴，反而崇尚于近几年泛滥起来的那些宣扬唯我意识、主观主义的荒谬观点，不知不觉地让这个“大敌”钻到了自己的头脑里，又在这场风波中反映在自己的言行上，以至犯了错误。这是一个深刻的教训。
    不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中
    我国宋代文学家苏轼写过一首著名诗篇《题西林壁》：“横看成岭侧成峰，远近高低各不同。不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。”从写景入笔，却生发出深刻的哲理，耐人寻味，可以用来说明认识上的片面性。片面性，就是不知道全面地看问题，只见局部，不见全体，只见树木，不见森林。这场风波来势凶猛，变化急剧，几种矛盾交织在一起，情况异常复杂，就好像云雾缭绕的庐山一样，只从某个侧面、某个角度去看，都不能观其全貌。不少同学之所以“不识庐山真面目”，看不清这场风波的实质，恰恰是由于他们被卷入其中，“身在此山”，当事者迷。他们被动乱的狂潮和反动的宣传所包围，只能观察和感觉到身临其境的一个很小局部，看不到全局的情况和复杂的背景，这就不可避免地要陷入片面性。比如，一些同学在天安门广场参加了绝食或静坐，成天听的是“高自联”的造谣广播，看到的是周围的人群，信息单一，视野狭窄，时间越长，受毒越深。他们在这个局部的“小天地”里，既无法看清敌对分子策划长期占领天安门广场的恶毒阴谋，也感受不到全国各族人民对这种“占领”的强烈义愤。结果自以为是投身于所谓“轰轰烈烈的爱国民主运动”，实际上却浑浑噩噩地被动乱的组织者当作了政治要挟的“人质”。只有当他们通过学习了解了这场风波酝酿、发生和发展的全过程，了解了国际“大气候”和国内“小气候”的复杂背景，才可能从全局的高度看清这场风波的性质和兴风作浪者的“真面目”。正如一位同学在反思总结中谈到思想方法时所说，“看来要认清这场风波的性质和自己的弱点，需要‘从车子上跳下来再爬上去’”。意思是只有从动乱这辆“车子”上跳下来，才能看清它的动乱轨迹；只有“再爬上去”，即把自己“摆进去”，才能认识自己的问题。这种既从全局又从局部看问题的思维方法，就克服了认识上的片面性。
    值得注意的是，近几年来那些坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，在竭力吹捧西方资本主义世界的同时，抓住局部的、个别的现象竭力丑化党的领导和社会主义制度。用攻其一点、不及其余、尽量夸大的唯心主义的片面手法欺骗了一些青年学生，使他们对党和社会主义失去信心，滋生了崇洋心理和离心倾向，以至在这场风波中被动乱的组织者牵着鼻子走。正如有的同学所说：“这几年我们满脑子是社会的弊端，两眼盯着社会的阴暗面，这就必然要犯错误。”
    被表面现象和假象蒙住眼睛最危险
    不少同学看问题往往简单化、表面化，不善于透过现象抓住本质。在这场风波中，有些同学带着偏激情绪“跟着感觉走”，粗枝大叶地看到一些表面现象，有些还是假象，就妄下结论，甚至对荒诞离奇的谣言也不加分析和印证，就盲目地相信和传播，糊里糊涂地“跟着谣言走”。殊不知，感觉只能解决现象问题，“假象会蒙住眼睛”，而谣言足可以“杀人”。特别是当敌人给人以假象而把真相掩盖起来的时候，更容易上当受骗。比如，当动乱的组织者4月22日施行“哀兵”策略，搞所谓“长跪请愿”；4月27日游行突然变更口号；5月19日在事先知道要戒严的情况下匆匆忙忙宣布停止绝食等花招下，不少同学就被假象所蒙蔽，看不清他们“以退为进”、“以守为攻”的险恶用心，更看不清这场斗争的实质，反而把责任推到党和政府身上。这说明，如果对所看到的各种现象，不加以“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”的思索，就很难透过现象抓住本质。
    马克思主义认为，任何事物都是本质和现象的统一体。本质是指事物的内部联系，是由事物的内部矛盾，特别是主要矛盾的主要方面所规定的；现象是指事物的外部形态和外部联系，是本质的外部表现。本质和现象是统一的，但现象毕竟不是本质，本质和它的表现之间并不总是一致的，假象则是事物本质的一种歪曲的、颠倒的表现。在今天仍然存在着阶级斗争的社会里，要认清重大社会事件的本质，必须运用阶级分析的方法。只有用阶级分析的方法，才能较易认识到这场动乱和随之发生的反革命暴乱，实质上是以推翻共产党的领导和社会主义制度，在中国建立资产阶级共和国为目标的罪恶行径。同样，只有用阶级分析的方法，才能看清方励之、严家其、吾尔开希之流卖国求荣的反动嘴脸，看清他们竭力鼓吹的所谓“民主”、“自由”、“人权”的资产阶级本质，也才能理解他们堕落成为民族败类的必然结局。应当承认，这些年来我们的宣传工作对于阶级斗争观点、阶级分析方法讲得太少了，而诸如两种社会制度的“趋同”与“融合”等抹煞阶级斗争的观点却泛滥起来，这就使得很多同学阶级观念淡漠，敌情观念消失，不知道阶级分析为何物。以至于在这场风波中，不少学生对发生在身边的阶级斗争和明火执杖的阶级敌人视而不见，麻木不仁，反而把“高自联”的坏头头看作学生的“领袖”，把方励之、严家其等人看作是青年的“导师”，结果，被他们“领”向了动乱，“导”入了歧途。这个血的教训永远也不能忘记。
    掌握马克思主义哲学这把智慧的钥匙
    上述关于主观与客观、全局与局部、本质与现象的简要论述，乃是马克思主义哲学的基本常识。这些常识同学们在高中和大学都学过了，考试成绩也许都不错。但是毋庸讳言，不少同学不过是为了应付考试而学，死记硬背一些概念，考试一过也就“还给老师”了；即使还记住一些条条，也不会或不打算运用。再加上这些年泛滥起来的一股贬低、否定马克思主义的思潮，造成了极大的思想混乱，冲垮了不少学生的思想堤防。这样，他们在现实斗争的考试中“不及格”，也就不足为怪了。
    马克思主义哲学是人类迄今为止最科学、最完整的世界观和方法论，是“伟大的认识工具”，它可以指导我们在纷繁复杂的矛盾中抓住根本，在变幻莫测的事物发展中把握方向，在各种各样的困难中找到解决的途径，是无产阶级和广大人民群众在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中的思想武器和行动指南。
    我国著名科学家钱学森写过一篇题为《智慧与马克思主义哲学》的文章（载《哲学研究》1987年第二期），谈了自己的切身体验。他在文中说：“我在国外从事教学和研究工作期间，没有好的机会学马克思主义哲学，只是在工作中，从经验和教训中得出了几条治学应该注意的东西；如看问题应找什么角度，碰了钉子又如何办等。当时还自以为这是我的心得。回到社会主义祖国后，有可能认真学点马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的著作了，才发现我的那几条治学心得，比起马克思主义哲学来，就好比大海中漂着的几个小水泡，算不了什么！”接着他详细地论述了什么是智慧以及如何从智慧的本质上去探讨培养智慧的切实可行而又有效的途径。他的深切感受是：要有智慧就必须懂得并会运用马克思主义哲学去观察分析客观世界的事物。但愿同学们能读一读钱老的这篇文章，并从中受到教益和启示，从而认真学习马克思主义哲学，努力掌握马克思主义的立场、观点和方法。这样，既可以在阶级斗争中辨别方向，分清是非；又可以在工作和研究中有所创造，有所前进。这对于青年同学们更好地“做人”和更快地“成才”都是大有裨益的。
