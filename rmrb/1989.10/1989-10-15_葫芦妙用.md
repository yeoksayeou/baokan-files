Gourds are the fruits of an annual herbaceous plant also known as the gourd. Generally, they have a shape that is narrow in the middle and bulging at both ends, resembling two spheres of different sizes joined together. Once matured and dried, they have a smooth and hard outer shell.

In the past, Native Americans in the Americas ingeniously tied several gourds together to form gourd rafts, which they used as water transport vessels to float on rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water. In a certain historical period in Haiti, the value of gourds surged, and they were once used as currency, circulating widely in the market. One gourd was equivalent to the value of one French franc.

Archaeological discoveries have revealed that many exquisite artifacts are preserved in the pyramids of Egypt, including gourd products.

Today, gourds continue to be favored by people around the world. In South Asia and Africa, in the central and southern parts of the Americas, on islands in the ocean, and in certain regions of Europe, people process or modify gourds according to their actual needs: smaller ones are made into bowls or cups, spoons or ladles; larger ones are transformed into buckets or wine jars. Of course, gourd-made percussion and string instruments are also quite common, with the former producing a resonant and powerful sound, and the latter a melodious and mellow tone. In Africa, many fishermen still use gourds as floats on their fishing gear. Additionally, in rural areas of Peru, a type of hand-pushed wheelbarrow is still popular, and the wheels of this cart are often made from gourds.

    葫芦妙用
    葫芦是由一种亦称为葫芦的一年生草本植物所结出的果实。一般而言，其外观多呈中间细窄而两端粗大的形状，宛如两个几何体积不等的圆球连缀在一起；在成熟并晒干后都有一个光滑且坚硬的外壳。
    在以往的岁月里，美洲的印第安人曾巧妙地把一些葫芦捆扎在一起，形成一个个葫芦筏子，让它们充作水上交通运输工具漂行在江河湖泊中。在海地的某一历史时代，葫芦的“身价”倍增，一度被当成货币在市面上广为“流通”，一个葫芦相当于一个法国法郎的使用价值。
    据考古发现，在埃及的金字塔里珍藏着许多工艺佳品，其中就有葫芦制品。
    现在，葫芦依旧受到世人的青睐。在南亚和非洲，在美洲的中部和南部，在大洋中的岛屿上和欧洲的个别地区，人们根据自己的实际需要对葫芦进行加工或改造：小个的，被加工成饭碗或茶杯、饭勺或羹匙；大个的，被改造成水桶或酒坛。当然，用葫芦制成的打击乐器和弦乐器也是屡见不鲜的了，演奏起来，前者是那样铿锵而浑厚；后者是那样悠扬而婉转。在非洲，至今还有不少渔民把葫芦作为渔具上的漂子加以使用。此外，在秘鲁的农村目前还盛行着一种手推的独轮小车，而这种小车的车轮大都是用葫芦来充当的。
