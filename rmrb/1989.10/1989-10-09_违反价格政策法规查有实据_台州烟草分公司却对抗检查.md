According to a report from the State Price Bureau's Price Supervision and Inspection Department, the Taizhou Tobacco Company in Zhejiang Province has seriously violated national price policies and regulations, and has resisted inspections by the inspection authorities, causing a very bad influence among the public.

In January of this year, the Taizhou Price Inspection Bureau discovered during an inspection that the Taizhou Tobacco Company had used the tactic of issuing invoices at the state-set prices while collecting payments at black-market prices to raise cigarette prices. From June 1987 to September 1988, the company collected an additional 1,684,000 yuan for cigarette price increases, including 727,000 yuan in direct cash payments. In July of last year, just a few days before the national cigarette price adjustment, the company issued fictitious sales invoices for 2,850 cases of "Ningbo" filtered cigarettes, and later collected payments at the adjusted prices, illegally gaining 140,000 yuan. Additionally, the company arbitrarily lowered prices when wholesale selling certain low-grade cigarettes, causing an economic loss of 820,000 yuan to the state. The company also exchanged cigarettes for sugar at high prices and privately distributed 17,184 yuan of illegal gains.

The inspection also revealed that the company sold a large quantity of cigarettes in an abnormal manner. In the first eight months of last year alone, the company sold 1,468,000 cases of cigarettes outside its supply area, with 40.5% being grade-A cigarettes.

According to the Price Supervision and Inspection Department, the Taizhou Tobacco Company did not cooperate with the inspection authorities during the inspection, refusing to provide account books and financial vouchers. After the inspection department issued a written notice not to transfer the price increase funds, the company still made a rush to refund 240,000 yuan and tampered with the dates on the refund receipts. Local price inspection authorities encountered interference from multiple parties during the handling of this case. To this day, the processing decisions and review decisions made by the provincial and municipal price inspection bureaus have not been fully implemented.

    违反价格政策法规查有实据  台州烟草分公司却对抗检查
    据新华社北京10月6日电（记者傅刚）记者从国家物价局物价监督检查司获悉，浙江省台州烟草分公司严重违反国家价格政策和法规，而且对抗检查机关的检查，在群众中造成很坏影响。
    今年1月，台州地区物价检查所在检查中发现，台州烟草分公司采取按国家定价开发票、按黑市价格收货款的手法提高烟价，仅1987年6月到1988年9月，就向购货单位收取卷烟提价款168.4万多元，其中直接收取现金72.7万元。去年7月，这个公司在国家卷烟调价的前几天，突击开列空头销售发票，虚假销售过滤嘴“宁波”烟2850条，事后再将其按调价后价格收取货款，从中牟取非法所得1.4万多元。另外，这个公司在批发销售部分低档卷烟时，擅自降价，给国家造成经济损失82万多元。这个公司还以烟换糖，高价倒卖，私分非法所得17184元。
    检查中还发现，这个公司将大量卷烟非正常销售。仅去年1—8月就向供应区以外销售卷烟146.8万条，其中甲级烟占40.5％。
    据物价局物价监督检查司介绍，台州烟草分公司对于检查机关的检查，先是不配合、不提供帐册和财务凭证；在检查部门书面通知不得转移提价款以后，仍突击退款24万多元，并在退款票据的开票日期上大做手脚。当地物价检查机关在查处此案的过程中，受到了多方面的干扰， 至今省、地两级物价检查所作出的处理决定和复议决定仍未全部执行。
