The county was originally part of the revolutionary base area of Shaan-Gan-Ning and now has a population of 187,000. In recent years, some farmers have gone out to do business or work, and the closed-off villages have begun to be influenced by new ideas. As a result, the number of divorce cases among farmers has increased rapidly. The number of divorce cases resolved by the county court was 46 in 1985 and 92 in 1988. The proportion of divorce cases in civil cases has also risen from about 20% before 1985 to 38.2% by the end of 1988. This increase in divorce cases indicates:

	The Pursuit of Ideal Marriages

	Many people are unwilling to tolerate existing compromises in marriage. This type of divorce case accounts for 61% of the total number of divorces and is mainly reflected in the following forms of marriage:

	Long-term discordant marriages. For example, in a village in Yonghe Township, Liang from a certain village married, but due to differences in interests, personality, and hobbies with his wife, they frequently quarreled, leading to a strained marital relationship. The wife stayed at her parents' home for a long time and eventually divorced through court mediation.

	Marriages arranged by matchmakers and parents. In such marriages, the couple often meet only once or twice before setting the bride price and choosing an auspicious day for the wedding. For example, in a village in Gonghe Township, Ren from a certain village and Zhou were married by their parents, with a bride price of 800 yuan and three sets of clothes. They married in 1981, but due to a significant age difference, they did not live together for many years. Ren stayed at her parents' home for a long time and eventually divorced. In Yangjia Village, Yulinzi Township, a young woman named Yang was married off by her parents at the age of 17, with her family receiving 1,200 yuan in bride price from the groom's family. Yang did not agree to this marriage. After more than 10 years of marriage, the couple's feelings had turned cold, and she finally filed for divorce.

	"Swapping marriages." In Sanjia Township's Chuandao Village, Zhang and Guan exchanged sisters as wives. Zhang had a mental illness, and Guan's sister sued for divorce. Zhang's sister also demanded a divorce from Guan.

	Changes in Conditions Leading to Changes in Feelings

	Due to differences in wealth and status, feelings have changed. This type of divorce case accounts for 30% of the total number of divorces and includes the following forms:

	Extramarital affairs. In a village in Shanhe Township, Wang worked outside and met another woman. He wanted to leave his rural wife and, through persistent pressure, achieved his goal of divorce.

	"Large compensation divorces." In a village in Yonghe Township, Zhao originally had a harmonious relationship with his rural wife. After Zhao started working, due to changes in his political and economic status, he decided to abandon his wife, with whom he had lived for more than 10 years. To achieve his goal of divorce, Zhao, in addition to giving his wife a house and high-end furniture, also gave her an additional 2,000 yuan.

	Preference for the rich over the poor leading to emotional rifts. As some farmers became wealthy, some women began to dislike their husbands for not earning enough money and filed for divorce. In a village in Gonghe Township, Peng originally had a normal relationship with his wife. Later, his wife saw that some people in the village had become rich and thought her husband was incapable, so she wandered off to another place and eventually divorced through mediation. In divorce disputes, when both parties are farmers and have not "become rich," 97% of the time it is the woman who files for divorce. When the woman has no job and the man has a job, only 0.3% of the time does the woman file for divorce.

	From the above analysis, it can be seen that the improvement in farmers' material living standards has reduced their tolerance for marriages without love. At the same time, some people who have become rich have inflated desires, preferring new things over old; while those who are relatively poor are dissatisfied with their marital status, envying the rich and those with status, leading to instability in the relationships of both rich and poor families. This is a problem worth noting in rural divorce cases.

### 正宁县农村离婚案为何增加

    正宁县农村离婚案为何增加
    我县原属陕甘宁革命老区之一，现有人口18.7万。近几年来，一些农民出门经商、做工，闭塞的山村开始受到新思潮的冲击，农民的离婚案件也随着迅速增加。我县审结离婚案1985年为46件，1988年为92件。离婚案在民事案件中所占比例也由1985年以前的20％左右，上升到1988年底的38.2％。这增长的离婚数字说明：
    追求理想的婚姻
    不愿忍受现成的凑合婚姻，这类离婚案占离婚总数的61％，主要表现在对以下几种婚姻形式的冲击：
    长期不合谐的婚姻。如永和乡某村梁某结婚后，由于同女方的志趣、性格、爱好各异，经常吵闹，致使夫妻关系不睦。女方久居娘家不归，最后，经法庭调解离婚。
    媒妁之言，父母之命的婚姻。这种婚姻的双方往往见一两次面，就定彩礼，择吉日成亲。如宫河镇某村任某与周某由父母作主，以彩礼800元、衣服3身订亲，1981年结婚，婚后因双方年龄悬殊较大，多年未同居，任某久居娘家不归，最后离婚。榆林子镇党家村女青年杨某17岁时由父母包办寻了婆家，娘家要了男方1200元彩礼，杨不同意这门婚事。婚后10多年，夫妻感情冷如冰，她终于提出了离婚诉讼。
    “转亲”、“换亲”婚姻。三嘉乡川道村张某和关某互娶了对方的妹妹，张某有精神病，关某的妹妹起诉离婚，张某的妹妹，也要求和关某离婚。
    条件变化引起感情变化
    由于贫富差距，地位变化，引起感情上的变化。这类离婚案占离婚总数的30％，有以下几种形式：
    婚外恋。山河镇某村王某在外地工作，结识了一妇女后，一心想抛开农村的妻子，在他的软硬折磨下，达到了离婚的目的。
    “巨额补偿离婚”。永和乡某村赵某原与农村的妻子关系和睦。赵参加工作后，由于政治、经济地位的变化，决心抛弃和自己生活了10多年的妻子，为达到离婚的目的，赵除了给女方房屋、高档家具外，还另给了2000元钱。
    嫌贫爱富造成感情裂缝。随着一部分农民富起来，有些妇女嫌男的不会挣钱而提出离婚。宫河镇某村彭某，原和妻子关系正常，后来他妻子看到村上的一些人富了，认为丈夫没本事，便流浪到外地，最后调解离婚。在离婚纠纷中，男女双方均是农民，且未“富起来”的，女方提出离婚的占97％；而女方没工作，男方有工作，女方提出离婚的仅占0.3％。
    从以上分析可以看出，农民物质生活水平的提高，使他们对原来没有爱情的婚姻的忍受力降低。同时，一些人富起来后私欲膨胀，喜新厌旧；而较贫困者对自己的婚姻现状产生不满情绪，羡慕有钱人、有地位人，带来了贫富两方家庭关系的动荡。这是农村离婚案中值得注意的问题。
