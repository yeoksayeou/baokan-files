The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army held a summary and awards conference for military arts performances today. Art troupes and artists who participated in the performances organized by the General Political Department this year, including "The People's Army Is Loyal to the Party," "The People's Army Loves the People," "The People's Army Loves the Motherland," and the national military arts gala for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, were commended.

Yang Baibing, Director of the General Political Department, spoke at the summary and awards conference. He pointed out that military arts work must adhere to the political direction of serving the people, serving socialism, and strengthening and enhancing the combat effectiveness of the troops. He said that to adhere to the correct direction, one must always unshakably uphold the themes of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, unshakably emphasize the positive reflection of the reality of the military and society, and unshakably prioritize social benefits.

Yang Baibing said that patriotism and revolutionary heroism are the powerful spiritual pillars of our army and also reflect the essence of our army. Our literary and artistic works can address contemporary themes or historical themes, and in form can be unrestricted, but no matter what the work, it must adhere to patriotism and revolutionary heroism. He said that we advocate for works that primarily praise and uplift, but this does not mean that we cannot write about backward characters, conflicts, problems, or even the dark side. Rather, it means that we must place the positive reflection of reality in the primary position. Even when exposing problems, we must not exaggerate our dark side, but rather use education and inspiration as our starting point, so that people see the light, see the future, and gain confidence. The basic function of literary and artistic works is to influence people's spirits, which requires that arts cannot ignore social effects. If we simply apply the principles of commodity economy to the arts domain, pursuing economic benefits and box office value, and doing whatever makes money, we will inevitably go astray.

When discussing the military arts team and its construction, Yang Baibing said that military arts workers must become the vanguard of socialist spiritual civilization construction, especially in political storms, to withstand tests, they must seriously study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the important statements of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, arm themselves with Marxism, take the lead in adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, and clearly resist and oppose bourgeois liberalization, making the military arts team a politically qualified, disciplined, morally upright, and artistically proficient combat collective.

    新华社北京10月28日电　（记者罗玉文）解放军总政治部今天举行全军文艺演出总结表彰大会。参加总政今年“七一”、“八一”、“十一”相继主办的《人民军队忠于党》、《人民军队爱人民》、《人民军队爱祖国》大型歌舞演出和庆祝建国40周年全军文艺调演的文艺团体和文艺工作者受到表彰。
    总政治部主任杨白冰在总结表彰大会上讲话时指出，军队的文艺工作一定要坚持为人民服务，为社会主义服务，为巩固和提高部队战斗力服务的政治方向。他说，要坚持正确方向，必须始终毫不动摇地坚持爱国主义和革命英雄主义这个主题，毫不动摇地注重从正面反映军队和社会的现实生活，毫不动摇地把社会效益放在首位。
    杨白冰说，爱国主义和革命英雄主义是我们军队的强大精神支柱，也是我军本质的反映。我们的文学艺术作品，可以写现实题材，也可以写历史题材，在形式上可以不拘一格，但不论什么作品，都必须坚持爱国主义和革命英雄主义。他说，我们提倡以歌颂为主，并不是说就不能写落后人物，不能写矛盾、问题甚至阴暗面了，而是说必须把正面反映现实生活摆在主要的位置上；即使揭露问题的时候，也不能以偏盖全，甚至夸大我们的阴暗面，要把教育人、鼓舞人作为出发点，使人看到光明，看到前途，给人以信心。文艺作品的基本功能是对人们的精神产生影响，这就要求文艺不能不十分注重社会效果。如果简单地把商品经济的原则搬到文艺领域中，一味地追求经济效益，追求票房价值，怎么赚钱怎么干，就必然要走到邪路上去。
    杨白冰讲到军队文艺队伍和建设问题时说，军队工艺工作者要成为社会主义精神文明建设的生力军，特别是在政治风浪中能够经受住考验，就必须认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，学习邓小平同志的重要论述，用马克思主义武装自己的头脑，带头坚持四项基本原则，旗帜鲜明地抵制和反对资产阶级自由化，使军队的文艺团队真正成为政治合格、纪律严明、风气很正、艺术精湛的战斗集体。
