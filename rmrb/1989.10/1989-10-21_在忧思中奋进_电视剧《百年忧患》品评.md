With the deep, contemplative music of an electronic synthesizer, the screen shows a close-up of a pair of feet: these feet are wearing worn-out cloth shoes, moving laboriously and heavily along a rugged mountain path. When the camera zooms out to a wide shot and then cuts to a close-up, we see the protagonist, over fifty years old, with a look of deep concern on his face...

The four-episode television series "A Century of Worries" (written by Shi Ling and Zhang Fan, directed by Zhang Shaolin) begins by conveying a sense of worry that makes the audience concerned.

In our ancient cultural country, we have a tradition of valuing education that we can be proud of. However, the current state of rural basic education and the overall educational situation is worrying. In a short time, the consequences of educational backwardness will affect the quality of the nation and hinder economic development. This is more than just a "century" of worries!

It can be seen that the creators do not want to avoid the contradictions in real life. On the contrary, their creative passion comes precisely from their reflection on real life. Worries come from the desire to change reality. It is the high sense of social responsibility and mission that makes the creators discover and understand the poetic beauty of reality, thereby successfully completing the artistic creation of the work.

The success of "A Century of Worries" lies first in the narrative content's transcendence of the story prototype. This drama is based on an advanced example of raising funds to build schools. However, the creators did not stop at the level of simple reporting and superficial statements. Instead, they broadened their horizons and let their thoughts delve into a deeper layer of artistic connotation. Thus, we see that the work not only describes the process of raising funds to build schools but also weaves it into a broader background for presentation, thereby highlighting a more profound emotional impact.

If, in the heavy burden of worries, the creators still try to inspire people to advance, then this creative intention is mainly carried out through the successful portrayal of the protagonist, Qi Xiuwen. This is an artistic image of unique value in the gallery of Chinese television drama creation. This regional education bureau official, although over fifty years old, still tirelessly travels through the countryside, relying on a sincere heart and eloquent speech, moving and persuading farmers to raise funds to build schools and promote education, thus greatly improving the educational conditions on the loess plateau.

"I am 58 years old this year. Half of me is buried in the yellow earth. My salary is enough to live on. I don't want to get rich, and no one says to me: Qi Teacher, you give a speech and I'll give you five yuan." So, what force drives Qi Xiuwen to sacrifice comfort and travel through remote villages? It is a sense of mission to change reality, a spirit of selfless dedication that does not seek fame but seeks practical action. This is the realistic glow of the Qi Xiuwen image!

This television drama, which has a strong artistic appeal, has achieved success in its artistic creation not only in the above aspects. It has also made valuable explorations in the stylistic marginality, the unity and combination of non-narrative audiovisual information and narrative structure, and the actors' grasp of specific situations and psychology.

　　在忧思中奋进
　　——电视剧《百年忧患》品评
　　弘石
    随着电子合成器奏出的沉思般的音乐，画面上出现了一双脚的特写：这双脚穿着已经破旧的布鞋，艰难沉重地在崎岖的山路上移动。当镜头拉成全景又切换成近景时，我们看到年过半百的主人公，神情中透出深深的忧虑……
    四集电视连续剧《百年忧患》（石零、张凡编剧，张绍林导演）的剧情一开始，便向观众传递了一种令人关切的忧思。
    在我们这个文化古国，有着引以自豪的重教传统。然而，今天的农村基础教育乃至整个教育现状却令人堪忧。用不了多久，教育滞后所造成的后果，将影响民族素质和掣肘经济的发展。这岂止是“百年”忧患呵！
    可以看出，创作者并不想回避现实生活中的矛盾，相反，他们的创作激情恰恰源于对现实生活的思考。忧患，来自于变革现实的愿望。正是高度的社会责任感和使命感，使创作者从现实中发现和领悟审美诗情，从而成功地完成了作品的艺术创造。
      《百年忧患》的成功之处，首先体现在叙事内容对故事原型的超越上。本剧是在一个集资办学的先进事例基础上构思而成的。但是，创作者并没有停留在简单报道和浮泛陈述的层面上，而是开阔视野，让思维的触角去发掘出更深一层的艺术内涵。这样，我们看到，作品中不仅描述了集资办学的过程，而且将之与广阔的背景交织起来进行表现，从而凸现出一种更加厚重的情感冲击力。
    如果说，在沉重的忧患之外，创作者仍然力图在忧患中促人奋进的话，那么，这一创作意图主要是通过对齐修文这个主人公的成功塑造来负载的。这是一个在我国电视剧创作画廊中有着独特价值的艺术形象。这位地区教育局的干部，虽然年过半百但依然不辞劳苦地奔波于山野乡村，凭着一颗赤诚之心和一副演讲口才，感动和说服了农民自己筹资办学兴教，使黄土高坡上的教育条件得到了极大的改善。
  “我今年58岁了，黄土埋了大半截的人，工资够花了，我也不想发财，也没有人跟我说：齐老师，你做一次报告就给你五元钱。”那么，是什么力量驱使齐修文牺牲安逸而穿行于穷乡僻壤的呢？是一种变革现实的使命感，一种不尚虚名、但求实干的献身精神。这就是齐修文形象所闪亮的现实光辉！
    这部具有强烈的艺术感染力的电视剧，其艺术创造上的成功之处，还不仅仅止于上述一二。它在风格样式的边缘性、非叙事性视听信息与叙事结构的统一复合、演员对具体情景和心理的把握等方面，都有着可贵的探索。
