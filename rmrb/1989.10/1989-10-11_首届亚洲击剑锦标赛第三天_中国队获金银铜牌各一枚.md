The third day of the First Asian Fencing Championship saw Chinese fencers win one gold, one silver, and one bronze medal. Taiwan's fencers also secured one bronze medal.

Today, the Chinese fencing team achieved another remarkable feat at the Asian Fencing Championship, securing one gold, one silver, and one bronze medal. Taiwan's fencers also won one bronze medal.

Cheng Yefei, a recent graduate from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, triumphed in the men's saber final by defeating South Korea's Yu Shangzhou with a score of 10-7, claiming the championship. Chinese fencer Zheng Zhaokang secured the third place without a fight as his opponent withdrew.

In the afternoon's women's epee final, South Korea's Lee Sunmi defeated China's Zhai Xiumin with a score of 8-5, winning the championship. Huang Jinzhu, a 21-year-old fencer from Taiwan, made a surprising breakthrough. She first defeated this year's national epee champion Zhou Jianqiu with a score of 8-6, and then overcame South Korea's Han Meishu with the same score, securing Taiwan's first medal in this competition.

After Huang Jinzhu's victory, her coach was overjoyed with tears. According to her teammates, Huang Jinzhu originally competed in foil fencing and had only switched to epee for over a month. Winning a bronze medal was indeed a remarkable achievement.

Cheng Yefei hails from Guizhou. His coach mentioned that his best previous result was the 8th place in the national championships. In this championship, he advanced through each round, particularly in tonight's final for the championship, where he faced South Korea's relentless attacks with unwavering resolve, striking swiftly and accurately.

    首届亚洲击剑锦标赛第三天
    中国队获金银铜牌各一枚
    本报北京10月10日讯　记者陈昭报道：中国击剑选手在今天亚洲击剑锦标赛上，又获得金银铜牌各一枚。中国台北选手获得一枚铜牌。
    今年刚刚从北京体育学院运动系毕业的大学生蒋叶菲在男子佩剑决赛中以10∶7力克南朝鲜选手俞尚周，荣登冠军宝座。中国选手郑兆康在对手弃权的情况下，不战而胜获得第三名。
    在下午举行的女子重剑决赛中，南朝鲜选手李顺美以8∶5战胜中国的翟秀敏，摘走桂冠。年仅21岁的中国台北姑娘黄金珠爆出冷门，她先以8∶6战胜今年女子重剑全国冠军周建秋，尔后又以8∶6拚掉南朝鲜的韩梅淑，从而为中国台北队获得本届赛事的第一枚奖牌。
    黄金珠获胜后，她的教练喜极而泣。据她的队友说，黄金珠原来是花剑选手，改练重剑只有一个多月，能获得铜牌实属不易。
    蒋叶菲是一名来自贵州的选手。他的教练介绍，他在此之前的最好成绩是全国第8名。在本届锦标赛中，他一路过关斩将，特别是在今晚争夺冠亚军的决赛中，面对南朝鲜选手咄咄逼人的进攻，毫不手软，出剑迅速准确。（附图片）
