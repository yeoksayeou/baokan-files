It is said that Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the United States, primarily due to the rapid increase in the number of African American Muslims.

The United States has a total of six million Muslims, most of whom are Muslim immigrants from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as their descendants. Among them, African Americans account for at least one million, and this number is steadily increasing. In the United States, 85% to 90% of those who have converted to Islam are African Americans.

It was in the late 1960s and early 1970s that African Americans, shouting the slogan "Black is beautiful," began to convert to Islam in large numbers. Today, cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Detroit have become places where African American Muslims congregate. Asad, the chairman of the American Islamic Council, who was born in Palestine, pointed out that the increase in the number of African American Muslims is a "very healthy" phenomenon. They are more devout than foreign Muslims.

In the early 1950s, New York State had only three mosques. Muslims often found it difficult to find a place to pray. Now, the entire state has 112 mosques, with 71 of them located in New York City alone. Driving through the other four boroughs of Manhattan, one can often see green domes and white minarets standing by the roadside.

Part of the reason African Americans convert to Islam is their resistance to Christianity, and perhaps a more important factor is the racial psychological gap between them and white people: "Look, the God on the cross is white."

African American Muslims are proud of being Muslims. When you receive a business card from a black person that is half green and half white, as soon as you look at it with surprise, this black person will proudly declare and explain to you: "I am a Muslim. The white part represents purity, and the green part symbolizes paradise."

To help their children integrate into society, African American Muslims send them to public schools. However, once they return home, they must take religious classes. Children learn special Islamic rituals, dietary taboos, and the rules for praying five times a day from their parents.

If you pay a little attention to the restaurants on American streets, you will find some halal restaurants. Inside, Muslims strictly follow Islamic dietary rules: slaughtering animals according to religious rituals, not selling pork products, etc. The posters on the walls of the halal restaurants are like an advertisement menu, featuring dishes such as curried lamb, steamed salmon, and five-spice beef. Although it is rare to see black owners and chefs in American halal restaurants, there are often African American Muslims among the diners. Even if they are eating heartily, if the nearby mosque suddenly broadcasts the call to prayer, they will immediately put down their utensils, leave the dining table, and rush to the mosque to pray.

    美国的黑人穆斯林
    刘列励
    据说伊斯兰教在美国各种宗教中是发展得最快的，主要原因是美国黑人穆斯林队伍膨胀迅速。
    美国全国有六百万穆斯林，大部分是亚洲、非洲和中东地区的穆斯林移民及其后裔，其中美国黑人至少占一百万，且在不断增加。在美国境内皈依伊斯兰教义的，百分之八十五至百分之九十是美国黑人。
    美国黑人是在六十年代末七十年初高喊着“黑色是美丽的”这一口号而大量皈依伊斯兰教义的。今天，像纽约、洛杉矶、芝加哥、底特律等大城市，都成了黑人穆斯林聚居的地方。出生于巴勒斯坦的美国伊斯兰教理事会主席阿萨德指出，美国黑人穆斯林人数的增长是一种“非常健康”的现象，他们比外国穆斯林更加虔诚。
    五十年代初，纽约州还仅有三座清真寺，穆斯林要做礼拜，有时因找不到清真寺而急得团团转。而现在全州有一百一十二座，仅纽约市就有七十一座。驱车往曼哈顿市中心以外的其它四个区转转，不时能见矗立街旁的绿色穹顶和白色尖塔。
    美国黑人皈依伊斯兰教，部分原因是出于一种对基督教的抵制，更重要的因素或许是与白人之间的种族心理隔膜：“你瞧，十字架上的上帝是个白人”。
    美国黑人穆斯林为自己是伊斯兰教徒而自豪。当你从一位黑人手中接过一张一半绿色一半白色的名片，刚刚对它发出惊诧的目光时，这位黑人肯定会骄傲地向你表白和解释：“我是穆斯林，名片上的白色表示纯洁，绿色象征天堂。”
    为了让孩子与社会打成一片，美国的黑人穆斯林都把他们送到公共学校去念书，但一回家就必须补宗教课。孩子们从父母那儿学习特殊的伊斯兰礼仪、饮食禁忌、一天五次的祈祷规则等。
    稍微留心一下美国街头的饭店，你就会发现一些清真馆。里面的穆斯林都是严格遵循着伊斯兰饮食戒规的：按照宗教仪式屠宰牲畜，不卖猪肉食品，等等。清真馆内墙上的张贴物像一个广告食谱，有咖喱羊肉，清蒸鲑鱼，五香牛肉……。虽然在美国的清真馆里难得看到黑人老板和厨师，但食客中却不乏黑人穆斯林。别看他们吃得正香，如果附近的清真寺突然传出“伟大的主啊”的诵经声，他们都会立即放下餐具，离开餐桌，大步跑去清真寺参加祈祷。
