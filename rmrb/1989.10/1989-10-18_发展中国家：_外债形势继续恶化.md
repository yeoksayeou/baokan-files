Since the debt crisis erupted in Mexico in August 1982, the international community, Western financial circles, and developing countries have been working for eight years to address the debt crisis. From the Baker Plan to the Miyazawa proposal, from the establishment of interest compensation funds to debt capitalization, numerous plans and measures have been introduced to tackle the debt problem. However, the external debt of developing countries has not only failed to decrease but has instead grown at an accelerating rate. From $831 billion in 1982 to $1.3 trillion in 1988, the annual growth rate of debt has averaged 7%. Many debt-ridden countries have to use 50% to 70% of their export earnings to service their debt.

The increasing debt burden on developing countries is due to both deep-seated domestic economic factors and significant international political and economic influences.

Firstly, the high-interest rate policies of Western developed countries, particularly the United States, have exacerbated the debt burden. Globally, for every 1% increase in interest rates, debt-ridden countries have to pay an additional $6 billion annually. The entire developing world pays over $50 billion in interest each year due to fluctuating interest rates on loans.

Secondly, the severe imbalance in capital flows has made debt-ridden countries poorer while creditor nations grow richer. A recent authoritative report titled "Living Together in One World," published in Harare, reveals that from 1982 to 1988, the net amount of external debt borrowed by developing countries dropped from $104 billion to $26 billion. During the same period, non-debt capital inflows to developing countries amounted to only $20 billion. This indicates that capital inflows from developed countries to developing countries have been decreasing, while capital flows between developed countries have been increasing.

Thirdly, the series of trade protectionist measures adopted by developed countries have hindered the exports of developing countries. Substitute products have flooded the market, and the demand for raw materials and primary products has declined in the international market. Countries heavily dependent on single or a few products have seen their terms of trade deteriorate, leading to an increase in their debt service ratios. This has trapped many developing countries in a vicious cycle of debt.

Fourthly, the special preferential treatment for developing countries stipulated within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has not been implemented in practice. From the various agreements related to developing countries adopted by GATT, it appears that these countries would benefit significantly. However, due to their economic backwardness, single-product export structures, and low export organization capabilities, they cannot truly enjoy these preferential treatments. This makes the export prospects for developing countries even more bleak.

Lastly, the disagreements among developed countries have hindered the implementation of effective debt resolution plans and delayed the process. For example, the United States believes that the debt burden of the 15 most indebted countries should be addressed first. In contrast, France argues that the 10 richest countries in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) hold many Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) that have not been utilized and should be allocated to the poorest countries. Due to these differences, developed countries and Western commercial banks find it difficult to propose feasible debt resolution plans. However, developed countries and international financial institutions demand that debt-ridden countries ensure economic adjustment and implement austerity policies.

Additionally, the current trend of international economic regionalization will also have an adverse impact on resolving the debt crisis. The European Single Market in 1992, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that came into effect on January 1, 1989, and the emerging East Asian economic bloc, although they can generate trade creation benefits, are generally exclusive and will increase trade protectionism. Trade wars will escalate from bilateral conflicts to bloc-level conflicts. Developing countries will find it challenging to cope with this economic bloc situation, and their debt burden will increase.

Facing the worsening debt situation in developing countries, Western developed countries have proposed several plans to address the debt crisis. At the 1985 Seoul Summit, the United States changed its previous hardline stance, heeding Japan's advice on the debt issue, and proposed the Baker Plan. However, a fatal flaw of the Baker Plan was that it required Western commercial banks to provide new loans. These banks have been slow to act on lending to developing countries, leading to the Baker Plan's cold reception and stagnation. In June 1988, Japanese Finance Minister Miyazawa proposed an initiative advocating that developing countries obtain loans from Western commercial banks on a one-to-one basis by issuing bonds. This proposal was strongly criticized by the United States, which believed that the Miyazawa initiative would shift the risk of resolving the debt crisis from private banks to governments, exacerbating the situation. On March 10 of this year, after consultations between the United States and Japan, the United States proposed the Brady Plan, which involves using funds from the World Bank and the IMF to reduce the debt of heavily indebted developing countries and guarantee interest payments to reduce their core debt burden. The condition is that debt-ridden countries accelerate their economic adjustment process and promote domestic savings and investment. This new plan has been highly regarded by various countries, which see the Brady Plan as a two-pronged approach, a step forward from previous plans. However, it still falls short of the profit goals of commercial banks. Therefore, so far, Western commercial banks have been hesitant and slow to act.

In November 1988, the Brazilian government and representatives of international creditor banks formally signed a comprehensive agreement in New York to restructure Brazil's $82 billion external debt. This is the most significant debt restructuring agreement reached between international creditor banks and a developing country to date. In June of this year, the Latin American Economic System proposed the Delcastillo Suggestion, which called for reducing Latin America's debt and interest by 50%, issuing bonds with a 30 to 40-year maturity period for the remaining 50% of the debt, and setting the interest rate at 5%. However, developed countries and Western commercial banks have not supported this.

These series of initiatives and actions merely aim to encourage Western commercial banks and international financial institutions to provide new loans, increase financial aid, and forgive part of the debt of developing countries, serving only as temporary remedies and not fundamentally reducing the debt burden of developing countries. Due to the sharp increase in debt interest rates in the first half of this year, Africa's total external debt alone increased by $10 billion. The debt of Asian developing countries, which has long been below the world average, reached $314 billion in 1988. By the end of August this year, the total debt of developing countries had risen from $831 billion in 1982 to $1.32 trillion. The debt-to-GDP ratio of the entire debt-ridden countries has reached 50%. It is no wonder that at the recent 9th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, leaders of various countries strongly demanded an urgent resolution to the debt crisis facing developing countries.

Clearly, although the debt crisis has long attracted the attention of Western developed countries and the international community, and various plans and ideas have been proposed, there is still no practical plan or scheme to solve this problem. People hope that Western developed countries will quickly change their indecisive attitude towards solving the debt problem.

    发展中国家：
    外债形势继续恶化
    刘光溪
    自1982年8月在墨西哥爆发债务危机以来，国际社会和西方金融界以及发展中国家在解决债务危机的历程上已走了整整8个春秋。从贝克计划到宫泽喜一倡议，从设立利率补偿基金到债务资本化，解决债务问题的方案和做法可谓是接二连三的出台，但发展中国家的外债不但未减少，却有滚雪球增长的势头。从1982年的8310亿美元上升到1988年的1.3万亿美元，外债增长率年平均为7％，许多债务国须将其出口收入的50％—70％用于偿债。
    造成发展中国家债务负担日趋沉重，固然有其深刻的国内经济背景，但国际上一些政治经济因素也对此起了重要作用。
    首先，西方发达国家特别是美国的高利率政策加剧了债务负担。从国际范围来看，利率每上升1个百分点，债务国每年就要多付出60亿美元。整个发展中国家因变化不定的利率贷款每年就要付出500亿美元以上的利息。
    其次，严重的资金流向不合理使债务国愈穷、债权国愈富。最近在哈拉雷发表的一份题为“同处一个世界”的权威性调查报告表明，从1982年至1988年，发展中国家借外债的净金额从1040亿美元下降到260亿美元，同期流入发展中国家的非债务资金只有20亿美元。这就是说，从发达国家流入发展中国家的资金越来越少，而发达国家之间的资金流动却越来越多。
    第三，发达国家采取的一系列贸易保护主义措施使发展中国家出口受阻；替代产品大量增加，原料、初级产品在国际市场上需求趋跌，严重依赖单一产品或少数产品的债务国贸易条件恶化，偿债率日益提高。这就使许多发展中国家陷入了一种债务恶性循环。
    第四，关税及贸易总协定（以下称“总协定”）范围内规定的单方给予发展中国家的特别优惠待遇，只出现在文件上，没落到实处。从总协定通过的有关发展中国家的各项协议来看，表面上对它们很有意义，但实际上因这些国家的经济发展落后、单一的出口商品结构和较低的组织出口能力，它们不可能真正享受到这些优惠待遇。这样发展中国家的出口前景就更不容乐观。
    最后，发达国家之间的意见对立阻碍了有效解决债务问题方案的出台，拖延了时间。例如；美国认为应首先解决15个重债务国的债务负担问题；而法国则认为，在国际货币基金中，10个最富的国家拥有很多特别提款权，并未利用，应将这一部分让给最穷国家。由于这种分歧，使发达国家和西方商业银行很难拿出可行的解决债务方案。但同时，发达国家和国际金融机构却要求债务国保证推行经济调整，实行紧缩政策。
    此外，当前兴起的国际经济区域化浪潮也必将对解决债务危机产生不利影响。1992年的欧洲统一大市场、今年1月1日生效的美加自由贸易协定和正在酝酿形成的东亚经济圈，虽说能产生贸易创出效益，但总的来说具有排他性，贸易保护程度会变相提高，国家间的贸易战将上升为集团间的贸易战。发展中国家很难对付这种经济集团化的局面，债务负担将会加重。
    面对发展中国家恶化的债务形势，西方发达国家陆续抛出了一些解决债务危机的计划。在1985年的汉城会议上，美国改变过去强硬态度，正视日本在债务问题上提出的劝告，提出贝克计划，但贝克计划的一个致命弱点就是让西方商业银行增加新贷款。这些银行在向发展中国家提供贷款上行动迟缓，使贝克计划受到冷遇，陷入困境。1988年6月，日本大藏相宫泽喜一提出倡议，主张发展中国家在一对一的基础上以发行债券的形式获得西方商业银行的贷款。该倡议遭到美国的猛烈抨击，认为宫泽倡议会把解决债务危机的风险从私人银行转移到政府头上来，扩大事态。今年3月10日，美日两国经过协商，由美国提出了布雷迪构想，即通过利用世界银行和国际货币基金组织的款项削减负债累累的发展中国家的债务，并保证利息付款来减少它们的核心债务负担。条件是债务国加快经济调整进程和促进国内储蓄与投资。这一新构想受到各国重视，认为布雷迪计划是两条腿走路，比以前的计划前进了一步，但仍与商业银行的赢利目的相距甚远，因此，到目前为止，西方商业银行顾虑重重，迟迟不动。
    1988年11月巴西政府和国际债权银行的代表在纽约就重新安排巴西820亿美元外债的问题正式签署一揽子计划协议。这是迄今为止国际债权银行同发展中国家所达成的一项最重大的外债调整计划协议。今年6月，拉美经济体系提出了德尔卡斯蒂略建议，指出减少拉美50％的债务和利息，为偿付其余50％的债务发行期限30至40年的债券，确定利率5％。但发达国家和西方商业银行对此不予支持。
    这一系列倡议和做法不过是希望西方商业银行和国际金融机构提供新贷款、增加资金援助和免掉债务国的部分债务，仅起治标作用，并没有从根本上减轻发展中国家的债务负担。由于今年上半年外债利率猛增，光非洲外债总额就增长100亿美元。一直作为低于世界平均债务水平的亚太发展中国家的债务总额1988年也高达3140亿美元，到今年8月底，发展中国家的债务总额已从1982年的8310亿美元增至1.32万亿美元，整个债务国的债务占国民生产总值的比率高达50％。难怪在最近举行的第9次不结盟国家首脑会议上各国领导人强烈要求尽快解决发展中国家债务危机。
    可见，债务危机虽早已引起西方发达国家和国际社会的关注并提出一些计划和构想，但至今仍未有一个解决这一问题的现实方案和计划。人们希望西方发达国家尽快改变解决债务问题的徘徊不前的态度。
