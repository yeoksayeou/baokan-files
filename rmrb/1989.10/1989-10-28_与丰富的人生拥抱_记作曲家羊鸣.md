With a Rich Life Embrace
—Recalling Composer Yang Ming

	Yang Ming pushes his glasses up onto his forehead, and amidst his thick hair, it seems another pair of eyes are peering out. Perhaps he truly has another set of senses, allowing him to capture sounds from silence and melodies from noise. At this moment, the gleaming lenses of his glasses reflect a vast expanse of sky, and I can't help but look up as well, gazing at the heavens—

	In the sky, there are distant clouds, nearby clouds, thick clouds, and thin clouds.

	In the recent performance by the Air Force Song and Dance Troupe, "The Melody of the Blue Sky," I repeatedly saw the name Yang Ming listed as the composer for many of the song and dance numbers. This reminded me of his composition "I Love the Blue Sky of My Motherland" from about 30 years ago; "I Fly in the Sky of My Motherland" from 20 years ago; and "Morning Breeze Blows Through the Path at the Airport" from 10 years ago. This composer, whose spirit has soared through the skies for decades, perhaps it is the blue sky that has given him elegance, romance, talent, and wings. Suddenly, I feel that through the glasses perched on his forehead, I can see into his heart. His heart must be a canvas of blue, with a few white clouds floating on it. Suddenly, I feel that he pushing his glasses up is a childlike gesture, mimicking the pose of someone wearing a flight cap. Yes, he has a touch of innocence. I think that innocence is an essential quality for an artist. Even when he is appointed as a judge for some major competition and needs to sit upright and formal, he will enthusiastically applaud the works he likes, without any hesitation. Moreover, when he eats, he always chews loudly for the sake of his stomach. Thanks to these habits, his spirit and body remain healthy.

	Yang Ming also has times when he is tormented by illness. A few months ago, he was in the hospital with a mysterious fever, and I went to visit him. Seeing this 1.8-meter-tall man confined to his sickbed, I tried to please him: "I brought you some good medicine. Our song has been recorded." He smiled and listened. "Unfortunately, the recording was half a tone lower." I don't know who gave him the strength, but he almost sat up: "What a pity, I should have gone to the recording studio. It should be sung like this—I once rowed a boat on the Li River, the water so green and intoxicating like fine wine. I once climbed the Yellow Mountains..." Oh, the Li River, the Yellow Mountains, even on his sickbed, he still dreams of these places. With a fever of 40 degrees, neither Chinese nor Western medicine could cure him, but seven musical notes could make him feel relieved, instantly making him feel as if all his ailments had vanished.

	It is like this: art makes him wither, but also makes him strong; art drives him mad, but also sets him free. More than 20 years ago, during the creation of the opera "Jiang Jie," his soul day and night galloped in the world of melodies and sounds, unable to extricate himself, and he developed auditory hallucinations. On a speeding train, the music, the noise, the grinding of the rails and wheels, all tormented him to the point of wanting to jump off the train. In the past 40 years, his musical creations can be summarized into three series: the opera series, including collaborations like "Jiang Jie," "Remembering Mother," and "The Four-Part Symphony of Blood and Fire"; the blue sky series, with each decade producing a widely popular song about the air force; and the series praising the motherland, with works like "Putting My Heart Against the Motherland" in 1983, "I Am Happy, I Was Born in China" in 1985, and "The Motherland in My Daughter's Heart" in 1987. I think it is not necessary to enumerate them in detail. What is important is that his heart's voice, his melodies, are deeply loved by the people. Many of his works are sung by millions, spreading far and wide. Through these, he has realized the embrace of souls with the people, embracing a rich life.

　　与丰富的人生拥抱
　　——记作曲家羊鸣
    韩静霆
    羊鸣把眼镜顺着额头推上去，浓密的头发中间似乎也生着一双眸子。也许他的确另有一副感官，为着从静寂中捕捉音响，从喧嚣中攫取旋律。此刻，那双闪闪烁烁的镜片里收着一片空域，我不由地也抬了头，望望天空——
    天上，远的云，近的云，浓的云，淡的云。
    羊鸣，在空军歌舞团最近推出的一台歌舞《蓝天的旋律》中，我不断看到许多歌曲节目的曲作者三个字后面都有这个名字，这使我想起他大约30年前作曲的《我爱祖国的蓝天》；20年前的《我飞在祖国的天空》；10年前的《晨风吹过机场的小道》。这位数十年心灵在天空飞翔的作曲家，也许正是蓝天给了他灵秀、浪漫、才气和翅膀。忽然觉得可以从那副架在颅上的镜片望见他的心底，他的心上想必正是蔚蓝的底色，凝着几朵白的，是云。忽然觉得他把眼镜架在头上，是孩子的模仿，模仿戴着飞行帽的姿态。是的，他有几分天真。我以为，天真是艺术家切切不可少的气质，即使是他被册封为某某大赛评委，需正襟危坐的时候，他也为自己喜欢的佳作拚命鼓掌，毫不掩饰。还有，他吃东西的时候，为了自己的胃，总是咂得很响。多亏这些，他的心灵和体魄都健康。
    羊鸣也有病魂儿缠绕的时候。数月前，他在医院发着莫名其妙的烧，我去看他。看到这位1.8米的汉子被困病榻，我存心想讨他喜欢：“我给你带来一副好药，咱们那首歌录音了。”他笑了，听着。“只可惜录音时低了半个调。”不知谁赋予了他力量，他几乎坐了起来：“真可惜，我应该到录音棚去。应该这样唱——我曾在漓江荡轻舟，醉人的水呀碧绿似美酒。我曾在黄山……”哦，漓江，黄山，在病床上他仍作此神游。40度高烧，中药西药难以对症，七个音符却可以使他如获大释，顷刻间如百病皆无。
    就是这样，艺术使他憔悴，也使他强健，艺术使他走火入魔，也使他获得解脱。20多年前他在歌剧《江姐》的音乐创作中，灵魂日日夜夜在旋律和音响世界中驰骋，不能自拔，产生了幻听。在奔驰的列车上，乐声，噪声，铁轨和车轮的磨擦声，搅扰得他几乎跳车。40年来，他的音乐创作可以概括成三个系列。歌剧系列：与人合作的《江姐》、《忆娘》、《血与火的四重奏》等；蓝天系列：每一个十年都有一首流传甚广的空军题材歌曲；歌颂祖国系列：仅近几年便有1983年的《把心贴着祖国》，1985年的《我幸福，我生在中国》，1987年的《女儿心中的祖国》。我以为不必细数，重要的是他的心音、他的旋律，深受群众喜爱，他的许多作品万人传唱，不胫而走。他以此实现了与群众的灵魂的拥抱，与丰富的人生拥抱。
