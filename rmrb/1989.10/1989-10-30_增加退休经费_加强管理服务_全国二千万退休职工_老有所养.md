Over the past few years, the management and service work for retired workers in China has gradually been strengthened and developed. Currently, the basic needs of the 20 million retired workers nationwide are met, and some retired workers continue to play a role in the construction of both material and spiritual civilization.

According to information from relevant departments, the number of retired workers in China has grown rapidly over the past 40 years. In 1952, there were only 20,000 retired workers. By the end of 1988, the number had surged to 20 million. Retirement funds have also increased from 1.63 billion yuan in 1978 to nearly 30 billion yuan in 1988. According to a survey in March 1989 in some regions, the average monthly income of retired workers in state-owned enterprises reached 110 yuan (including various subsidies). Overall, the living conditions of the majority of retired workers have been basically guaranteed.

It is understood that as the number of retired workers continues to grow, retirement management and service organizations have gradually been established nationwide, laying the foundation for the management and service work for retired workers.

After the establishment of retirement committees at various levels, activities in various forms have been actively carried out according to the needs of retired workers, and many good deeds and practical things have been done for retired workers.

Trade unions and retirement committees at various levels have also, in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and acting within one's capabilities, actively organized retired workers to engage in various social welfare activities. Currently, retired workers have become an important force in the construction of grassroots political power at the district and street levels.

　　增加退休经费　加强管理服务
　　全国二千万退休职工“老有所养”
    据新华社北京10月29日电  （记者刘思扬）近几年来，我国退休职工管理服务工作逐步得到加强并有发展。目前，全国2000万退休职工基本实现“老有所养”，部分退休职工继续在两个文明建设中发挥作用。
    记者从有关部门了解到，近40年来，我国退休职工人数发展很快。1952年仅有2万人，截至1988年底，全国退休职工已猛增至2000万人。退休经费也由1978年的16.3亿元增加到1988年的近300亿元。据1989年3月部分地区调查，全民企业退休职工人均月收入达110元（含各种补贴）。从总体上说，广大退休职工的生活基本上得到了保障。
    据了解，在退休职工队伍日益壮大的同时，全国各地退休职工管理服务组织也逐步建立起来。为开展退休职工管理服务工作打下了基础。
    各级退委会成立后根据退休职工的需要，积极开展多种形式的活动，为退休职工做了大量好事、实事。
    各级工会组织和退委会还本着自愿和量力而行的原则，积极组织退休职工从事各项社会公益活动。目前，在区街一级政权建设中，退休职工已成为一支重要力量。
