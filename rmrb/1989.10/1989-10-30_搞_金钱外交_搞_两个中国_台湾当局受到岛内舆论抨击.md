Taiwan authorities have recently faced criticism from domestic public opinion for their "dollar diplomacy" and blatant promotion of the "Two Chinas" policy in their efforts to establish or re-establish diplomatic relations with certain countries. Various opinions have emerged within Taiwan, with some media outlets mocking and criticizing these actions.

Recently, when Taiwan established or re-established diplomatic relations with Grenada, Liberia, and Belize, Taiwanese newspapers sparked debates over "dollar diplomacy." The *China Times* reported that after announcing the establishment of relations with Liberia, the Taiwan authorities "were eagerly awaiting applause but found that everyone's attention was focused on the rumored huge loan, which was not a pleasant feeling." The newspaper stated that despite the authorities' repeated denials of the rumor that $200 million was paid to achieve the diplomatic breakthrough, the public did not believe them. Most people thought that "where there is smoke, there is fire," and since buying diplomacy with money was not the first time for Taiwan, even if there were no $200 million, a considerable amount must have been spent. The newspaper also reported that some people criticized the authorities for acting as a "scatter money boy" for diplomacy, questioning whether such a "sucker" was worth it.

Some Taiwanese media outlets have criticized the authorities for creating the "Two Chinas" situation in their efforts to establish or re-establish diplomatic relations with certain countries. According to reports, female legislator Wu Shuozhen questioned the "Premier" Li Huan and "Foreign Minister" Lian Zhan in the "Legislative Yuan," arguing that before establishing relations with Grenada, Liberia, and Belize, "we knew that these three countries had formal diplomatic relations with China." She believed that the key to this so-called "diplomatic breakthrough" was that the Taiwan authorities "could find a future for Taiwan outside the 'unified China,'" using formal diplomatic relations to confirm the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are two sovereign entities. Wu Shuozhen pointed out that President Lee Teng-hui claimed that "Taiwan's future cannot be independent of a unified China," but international political realities clearly showed that "Taiwan's future is independent of a unified China." She sarcastically asked, "Is it that Taiwanese independence is something that 'can be done but cannot be said'?"

The *United Daily News* also published an editorial on Belize's foreign minister's public declaration of adopting the "Two Chinas" policy, stating that the phrase "Two Chinas" would cause a sharp pain in the hearts of almost all Chinese people at home and abroad. It represented not only the misfortune of the nation and the tragedy of the people but also the direct or indirect wounds that almost everyone had experienced.

Some Taiwanese figures, considering the international situation, poured cold water on Taiwan's so-called "diplomatic breakthroughs." Wu Da-you, the president of the Academia Sinica, published an article pointing out that establishing relations with Grenada should not be viewed as a "diplomatic breakthrough." He said, "Due to the trends in international politics (and even economics), our 'diplomatic allies' are becoming fewer and fewer, which is an undeniable fact."

### 搞“金钱外交”搞“两个中国”  台湾当局受到岛内舆论抨击

　　搞“金钱外交”搞“两个中国”
　　台湾当局受到岛内舆论抨击
    新华社北京10月29日电  台湾当局最近为同一些国家“建交”、“复交”而“拿钱买外交”和明目张胆地搞“两个中国”的行为，在台湾岛内引起了各种议论。一些舆论讽刺和抨击了台湾当局的这些做法。
    台湾当局近期与格林纳达、利比里亚和伯利兹“建交”或“复交”时，台湾报纸上都曾引发过对“金钱外交”的争议。《中国时报》报道说，宣布与利比里亚“建交”后，台湾当局“正喜孜孜地准备接受掌声时，却发现大家的注意力全摆在传闻中的巨额贷款，不免感觉不是滋味”。这家报纸说，尽管台湾当局一再否认为实现“建交”付出了2亿多美元代价的传闻，但民众并不相信，多数人认为“无风不起浪”，何况花钱买外交对台湾而言绝不是第一次，因此就算没有2亿美元，大概也花了相当一笔代价。这家报纸还报道，一些人为此指责台湾当局为了外交而充当“散财童子”，“这种‘冤大头’值不值得做？”
    台湾的一些舆论对当局为与一些国家“建交”、“复交”而不惜制造“两个中国”的行为提出了指责。据报道，台湾的女“立委”吴淑珍在“立法院”向“行政院长”李焕、“外交部长”连战提出质询时认为，台湾在同格林纳达、利比里亚和伯利兹“建交”之前，“都知道这三国与中共有正式的外交关系，伯利兹的外交部甚至公开宣称，他们采取‘两个中国’的政策”，因此她认为，这次所谓“外交突破”的“主要关键在于”台湾当局“能够在‘统一的中国’之外寻找台湾的前途”，“以正式建交的形式来确认台湾海峡两岸为两个主权的事实”。吴淑珍提出，李登辉“总统”虽然声称“台湾的前途，绝不能独立于统一的中国之外”，“但国际政治的现实明明已显示‘台湾的前途，独立于统一的中国之外’”。她讽刺说，“难道台独（在台湾）真的是‘能做不能说’？”台湾《联合报》也就伯利兹外长公开声称采取“两个中国”的政策发表社论说，“‘两个中国’一语，对绝大多数海内外中国人而言都会有一种如刀刺心的疼痛；因为，这不仅代表国家的不幸，民族的悲剧，更还是几乎每个人都直接间接，或多或少的受到过的创伤。”
    台湾还有一些人士从国际大局出发，给台湾的这些所谓“外交突破”泼了冷水。台湾“中央研究院院长”吴大猷发表文章指出，不能视与格林纳达建交为“外交突破”。他说，“由于国际政治（甚至经济）大势所趋，我们的‘友邦’愈来愈少，是事实上无容讳言的。”
