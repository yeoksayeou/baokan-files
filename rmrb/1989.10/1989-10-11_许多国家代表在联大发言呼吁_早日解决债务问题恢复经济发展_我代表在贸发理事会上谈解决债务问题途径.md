Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, October 6th — (Reporter Xu Limin) The past four days of general discussions at the Second Committee of this session of the UNGA have shown that debt and development issues remain the primary economic concerns of the international community. Many countries believe that external debt is a significant obstacle to the economic development of developing countries and have called for an early resolution to this problem.

Malaysia's Ismail, representing the Group of 77, said in his speech, "The debt crisis needs to be resolved on the basis of shared responsibility between creditor countries and commercial banks with debtor countries."

He also called for more new multilateral and bilateral plans to re-arrange the debt.

Pierre-Louis Blanc, representing the 12 member states of the European Community, said that although some regions have seen economic development, unfavorable trade terms and investment issues still leave debtor countries in a difficult situation.

Last year, the total external debt of developing countries reached $1.32 trillion, nearly half of their gross national product, and 170% of their total export earnings. Meanwhile, the outflow of funds from developing countries is also severe.

Chinese Ambassador Ding Yuanhong said that to alleviate the debt burden of developing countries, it is necessary to improve the external environment of debtor countries and take effective measures in areas such as commodities, trade, and finance to help them restore economic development.

Ghana's James Victor believes that reasonable commodity prices are crucial for developing countries. He said, "It is better to receive appropriate compensation for one's labor and efforts than to accept meager aid from others."

Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, October 4th — Representatives from Ghana and other Third World countries called today at the 44th UNGA for developed countries to eliminate trade barriers and effectively resolve the debt problems of Third World countries.

Ghana's Foreign Minister Obade Asamoah urged developed countries to eliminate tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. He said that the trade protectionism practiced by developed countries makes it increasingly difficult for developing countries, especially African countries, to enter the markets of industrialized countries.

According to reports, in 1987 alone, Africa's trade deficit reached $19 billion, with a net transfer of funds to the International Monetary Fund amounting to $1 billion, and repayment of principal and interest to creditor countries also totaling tens of billions of dollars.

Jamaica's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, David Cole, said in his speech that it is time for the United Nations to organize constructive dialogues between creditor and debtor countries to effectively resolve the debt problem. He said that the debt crisis is the core issue leading to negative economic growth and declining per capita income in Third World countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, October 6th — Chinese representative Li Zhiming pointed out at the 36th session of the UNCTAD Council that the fundamental way to resolve the debt problem is to promote the restoration and development of the economies of debtor countries, thereby enhancing their ability to repay debts.

Li Zhiming said that in recent years, the international community has recognized the urgency of the debt problem and actively explored various ways to resolve it, proposing many suggestions. However, these suggestions and plans have their limitations. He proposed that for countries facing severe debt repayment difficulties, in addition to taking necessary measures such as debt rescheduling, providing new loans, debt relief, and lowering interest rates, efforts should also be made to promote the restoration and development of the economies of debtor countries, thereby enhancing their ability to repay debts.

Li Zhiming advocated that the debt problem should be linked with issues of funds, trade, commodities, and currency, increasing the inflow of funds to developing countries, stabilizing the prices of primary products, and opening markets more widely to the export of products from developing countries, thereby creating a favorable international environment for the development of debtor countries. He believed that only in this way could the debt problem be fully and effectively resolved.

    许多国家代表在联大发言呼吁
    早日解决债务问题恢复经济发展
    我代表在贸发理事会上谈解决债务问题途径
    新华社联合国10月6日电　（记者薛力敏）本届联大第二委员会过去四天的一般性讨论表明，债务和发展问题仍然是国际社会关注的首要经济问题。许多国家认为，外债是严重阻碍发展中国家经济发展的枷锁，并呼吁早日解决这一问题。
    马来西亚的伊斯梅尔代表77国集团在发言中说，“债务危机需要债权国及商业银行与债务国在共同承担责任的基础上解决。”
    他同时呼吁用更多的新的多边及双边计划来对债务作出重新安排。
    法国的皮埃尔—路易·布朗代表欧洲共同体的12个成员国发言说，尽管某些地区经济有所发展，但由于不利的贸易条款及投资方面的问题负债国仍然面临困境。
    去年，发展中国家的外债总额达到1.32万亿美元，几乎占其国民生产总值的一半，是这些国家出口总收入的170％。与此同时，发展中国家的资金外流也十分严重。
    中国大使丁元洪说，为了解除发展中国家的债务负担，有必要改善债务国的外部环境，在诸如商品、贸易、金融等方面采取有效措施，帮助它们恢复经济发展。
    加纳代表詹姆斯·维克托认为，合理的商品价格对发展中国家至关重要。他说，“一个人的劳动和努力得到适当补偿要比接受别人吝啬的援助好得多。”
    新华社联合国10月4日电　加纳等第三世界国家代表今天在第44届联大发言时，呼吁发达国家消除贸易壁垒有效解决第三世界国家的债务问题。
    加纳外交部长奥贝德·阿萨莫阿在发言中敦促发达国家消除关税和非关税贸易壁垒。他说，发达国家实行的贸易保护主义使发展中国家尤其是非洲国家的产品越来越难以进入工业化国家的市场。
    据报道，1987年一年之内非洲外贸的逆差就高达190亿美元，向国际货币基金组织转移的资金净额达10亿美元，向债权国还本付息也多达数十亿美元。
    牙买加外交和外贸部长戴维·库尔在发言中说，现在是由联合国出面组织债权国和债务国进行建设性对话，有效解决债务问题的时候了。他说，债务危机是导致第三世界国家经济负增长和人均收入下降的核心问题。
    新华社日内瓦10月6日电　中国代表李志敏6日在联合国贸易和发展会议第36届理事会全会上指出，解决债务问题的根本途径在于促进债务国恢复和发展经济，提高偿还债务的能力。
    李志敏说，近年来，国际社会认识到了债务问题的紧迫性，积极探讨解决债务问题的各种途径，提出了许多建议。但是，这些建议和计划有其局限性。他提出，对面临严重偿债困难的国家，除采取包括重新安排、提供新贷款、减免债务和降低利率等必要措施外，还要促进债务国恢复和发展经济，提高偿还债务的能力。
    李志敏主张，必须把债务问题同资金、贸易、商品及货币问题联系起来审议处理，增加对发展中国家的资金流入，稳定初级产品价格，更大地向发展中国家出口产品开放市场，为债务国的发展创造一个有利的国际环境。他认为，只有这样，才能使债务问题得到全面有效的解决。
