The "Lekai" color film rolls produced by the First Film Factory of the Ministry of Chemical Industry in Baoding, Hebei Province, have quickly gained market share with their superior quality and competitive pricing. Currently, one out of every four color film rolls sold domestically is a "Lekai" brand. China has not only ended its history of being unable to produce color film rolls but has also introduced the "Lekai" II type color film roll, which boasts improved stability. With its quality and price advantages, it has successfully entered the U.S. and Japanese markets, where "Kodak" and "Fuji" dominate.

To catch up with the world's advanced standards, the Baoding First Film Factory, based on the mass production of the II type rolls, has concentrated its research strengths and, using the latest achievements in international photochemical technology from the 1980s, independently developed the BR100 new type color film roll. This film has fine grains, high clarity, vivid and saturated color reproduction, a wide exposure latitude, and excellent color sensitivity. Its main photographic performance indicators and actual shot images are comparable to those of "Kodak" and "Fuji."

Over the past 30 years since its establishment, the Baoding First Film Factory has undertaken the production of the majority of domestic film rolls, aerial photography film, color film rolls, and color photographic paper. Its products have evolved from the single black-and-white film rolls of the past to the current six major categories and over 70 varieties. It has successfully trial-produced color positive film, negative film, color reversal film, flatbed film, and various types of military and aerial photography film. It has also introduced embossed film and dye-imprinted film into production, becoming the sixth enterprise in the world to produce oil-soluble color film rolls.

　　“乐凯”彩卷后来居上
　　以质量和价格优势闯入国际市场
    本报讯　位于河北省保定市的化工部第一胶片厂生产的“乐凯”彩色胶卷，以物美价廉的优势迅速覆盖市场。现在，国内每销售四个彩卷就有一个是“乐凯”彩卷。我国不仅结束了自己不能生产彩色胶卷的历史，而且又推出了“乐凯”Ⅱ型彩卷，质量更趋稳定，加之价格优势，一举叩开国际市场的大门，进入“柯达”和“富士”称雄的美国和日本市场。
    为了赶超世界先进水平，保定一胶厂在Ⅱ型卷大量上市的基础上，又集中优势科研力量，运用80年代国际感光化学技术新成就，自主开发出了BR100新型彩色胶卷。颗粒精细，清晰度高，色彩还原饱和鲜艳，曝光宽容度大，有良好的感色特性，主要照相性能指标及实拍画面，足以和“柯达”、“富士”媲美。
    保定第一胶片厂建厂30年来，承担了国内绝大部分电影胶片、航摄胶片、彩色胶卷和彩色相纸的生产任务，产品已由过去单一的黑白电影胶片发展到现在六大类70多个品种，先后试制成功了彩色电影正片、底片、彩色反转片、平板模片以及各类军工片、航摄片等，并把浮雕片和染印法胶片投入生产，成为世界第六个步入油溶彩色卷的生产企业。
