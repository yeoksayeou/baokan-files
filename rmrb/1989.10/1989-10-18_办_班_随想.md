In early July, a theoretical bulletin in Beijing consecutively published two recruitment notices for classes aimed at implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles. The classes, lasting 10 days each, charged tuition fees of 140 yuan and 110 yuan respectively (excluding accommodation and meal costs for participants).

Announcing the establishment of "Implementation" and "Adherence" classes right after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee is indeed timely. However, I have different views on this matter. Over the past few years, schools and research institutions, particularly those in the party, government, and military systems, have organized study classes primarily or partly for the purpose of generating revenue. Do these classes align with the spirit of socialist reform? Do they uphold the fine traditions of the Party's ideological and theoretical work?

After the nationwide turmoil this spring and summer and the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, many issues need to be thoroughly summarized and studied under the guidance of the Party's basic line. However, is the condition ripe for organizing such classes at this rapid pace? Have the lecturers had sufficient time to prepare their reports based on thorough investigations and research? With ten days to listen to more than ten reports covering a wide range of topics, can this be considered "research" and "discussion"? In my opinion, hastily organizing politically charged classes primarily for revenue is misleading and not advisable.

It is understood that various types of short-term training classes have been or are being organized across the country and in different industries. The flourishing of social education activities is not a bad thing. The key lies in strengthening management. I suggest that relevant departments study and address this issue.

### 办“班”随想

    办“班”随想
    7月上旬，北京一家理论小报连续刊登了两个招生通知：举办以贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，坚持四项基本原则为主要内容的研讨班。学习10天，两个研讨班分别收取学费140元和110元（学员食宿费用自理）。
    在党的十三届四中全会刚结束就宣布开办“贯彻”班，“坚持”班，真够“紧跟”的了。但我对此却有不同看法。几年来，学校与研究单位，尤其是党政军系统，举办以创收为目的或目的之一的研讨班，是否符合社会主义改革的精神？是否符合党的思想理论工作的优良传统？
    经过今年春夏全国性的动乱和北京发生的反革命暴乱，许多问题需要在党的基本路线指导下认真总结与深入研究。但上述这样快的速度举办研讨班，条件是否成熟？报告人是否有充分时间在调查研究基础上准备自己的报告呢？10天时间要听十几个报告，内容又很广泛，这能算是“研究”与“讨论”吗？我认为，匆匆忙忙开办政治性很强，而以创收为目的或目的之一的研讨班，名不副实，不可取。
    据了解，全国各地，各行各业都办过或正在办各种类型的短训班。社会办学活动蓬勃兴起并非坏事，问题的关键在于必须加强管理。我建议有关部门研究及解决这个问题。
