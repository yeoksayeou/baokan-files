The men's team compulsory exercises at the World Gymnastics Championships concluded today. As of the time of this report, the Chinese team has secured a total score of 288.75 points, placing them in third position. The Soviet men's team scored 293.15 points, leading the rankings. The Democratic German team accumulated 288.80 points, temporarily holding the second position.

The women's team competition saw three rounds of matches yesterday. Chinese athlete Chen Cuiting scored 38.999 points individually, placing her in third position, while Li Yan scored 38.674 points, ranking fifth.

The head of the Chinese gymnastics delegation expressed satisfaction with the men's competition results. Deputy leader Ma Xiaoyuan told reporters, "The Chinese men's team of six athletes showed excellent spirit and performed meticulously in every event. Throughout the competition, there were no major mistakes. The outcome exceeded our initial expectations and was quite successful, especially considering that veterans like Li Ning, Tong Fei, and Lou Yun have retired, and newcomers like Li Jing and Ma Zheng are participating for the first time. This result is particularly noteworthy."

Head coach Yang Mingming stated to reporters, "The Chinese team's performance compared to the Soviet team falls short in terms of consistency and landing precision. Since the compulsory exercises emphasize stability, the Chinese men's team lagged behind the Soviet team. However, the Chinese men's team possesses the capability to compete with the Democratic German team."

He added, "Prior to this overseas competition, we instilled a sense of honor and crisis in the athletes. They all have a strong desire to achieve excellent results and are determined to reclaim the men's team bronze medal that the Japanese team won at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. After arriving in Stuttgart and observing the performances of the Japanese and Democratic German teams, our confidence grew. We believe we can not only compete with the Japanese team but also challenge the Democratic German team for a higher ranking."

    世界体操锦标赛男子团体规定动作赛毕
    中国队稳扎稳打积分排第三
    本报斯图加特10月15日电  记者江建国报道：世界体操锦标赛今天进入团体赛规定动作比赛的第2天。到记者发稿时为止，男子团体规定动作比赛全部结束。中国队总积分288.75分，位居第三。苏联男队得293.15分居第1位。民主德国队积288.80分，暂居第2位。
    女子团体赛昨天进行了三轮比赛，我国运动员陈翠婷个人积分38.999分，居第3位；李燕个人积分38.674分，居第5位。
    中国体操代表团负责人对男子比赛情况感到满意。副团长马肖援对记者说，中国男队6名运动员精神面貌好，每一项比赛都十分认真，整个赛程没有一个人有大的失误，比我们原来预想的情况好，比较成功，尤其是在李宁、童非、楼云等老将退役，李敬、麻征等新手首次出征的情况下，这个成绩就显得格外不易。女子队已出场的陈翠婷和李燕也都发挥得很好，争取这次团体赛中有所前进。
    中国队总教练杨明明对记者说，中国队同苏联队相比的差距在于规格和落地方面，由于规定动作主要看稳定性，因此，中国男队落后于苏联。但是，中国男队拥有同民主德国队一比高低的实力。
    他说，在这次出国比赛之前，他们以荣誉感和危机感教育队员。队员们都有强烈愿望，创造优秀成绩，都憋着一股劲儿赢回日本队去年汉城奥运会取得的男子团体铜牌。来到斯图加特之后，观看了日本队和民主德国队比赛情况后，增强了信心，不仅跟日本队，也可以跟民主德国队一争高低。
