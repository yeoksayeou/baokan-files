The Chinese government cares deeply for Hong Kong and Macau compatriots. Reports of water and food supply reductions are pure rumors.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 12th. Correspondent Wen Xian reports: At a press conference held this afternoon, a reporter asked, "Some Hong Kong newspapers claim that the incident of refusing to accept illegal immigrants was orchestrated by the Chinese side. They also allege that, in addition to refusing to accept illegal entrants, China will reduce or stop supplying Hong Kong with water and food. What is your comment on this?"

Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing replied, "We have not seen this report yet. If such a report exists, we believe it is irresponsible and malicious. Regarding the handling of Hong Kong residents entering the mainland and mainland residents entering Hong Kong through legal and illegal means, the spokesperson of Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch has already made statements on October 4th and 9th, which are very clear. The reports you mentioned about China reducing or stopping the supply of water and food to Hong Kong are pure rumors. The Chinese government cares deeply for Hong Kong and Macau compatriots. The policy we have long adopted to promote the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau will not change."

    中国政府对港澳同胞非常关怀  所谓减停供水等报道纯属造谣
    本报北京10月12日讯　记者温宪报道：在今天下午举行的新闻发布会上，有记者问，香港有报纸宣称，拒收偷渡者事件是中国方面策划的，并称中方除了拒绝接收非法入境者外，还将减少或停止供应香港食水和副食品。你对此有何评论？
    外交部发言人李肇星答道，目前我们还没有见到这个报道。如果真有这样的报道，我们认为这种报道是不负责任和别有用心的。关于香港居民进出内地和内地居民循合法和非法途径赴港问题的处理，我新华社香港分社发言人已于10月4日和9日先后发表讲话，说得很清楚了。你所说的中国将对香港减少或停止供水和副食品的报道，纯属造谣。中国政府对港澳同胞是非常关怀的，我们长期以来一直采取的有利于港澳经济繁荣和社会稳定的方针是不会改变的。
