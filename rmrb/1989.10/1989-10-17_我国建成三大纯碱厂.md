Each of the three soda ash plants with an annual production capacity of 600,000 tons—Shandong Weifang Soda Ash Plant, Hebei Tangshan Soda Plant, and Jiangsu Lianyungang Soda Plant—has been completed after three years of arduous efforts under the leadership and support of relevant central and local departments. The Weifang Soda Ash Plant and Tangshan Soda Plant have recently completed trial runs and produced qualified products. The Lianyungang Soda Plant is currently conducting single-unit and integrated trial runs and is expected to commence trial production this month.

The three soda ash projects were all designed domestically. Except for the Weifang Soda Ash Plant, which imported a small amount of key equipment, the Tangshan and Lianyungang Soda Plants have achieved near-complete domestic production of their equipment. Their completion and operation mark a new level in China's soda ash production technology.

    我国建成三大纯碱厂
    本报讯　年产量各为60万吨纯碱的山东潍坊纯碱厂、河北唐山碱厂、江苏连云港碱厂，在中央和地方有关部门的领导和支持下，经过3年的艰苦奋战，已全部建成。其中潍坊纯碱厂和唐山碱厂日前试车成功，生产出合格产品；连云港碱厂正在进行单机试车和联动试车，可望在本月内投料试车出碱。
    三大碱厂项目都是国内自行设计的，除潍坊纯碱厂引进少量关键设备外，唐山、连云港碱厂设备基本上实现了国产化。它们的建成投产标志着我国制碱工艺达到新的水平。
