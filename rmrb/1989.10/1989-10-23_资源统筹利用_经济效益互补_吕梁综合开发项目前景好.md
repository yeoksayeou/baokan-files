The Luliang Comprehensive Complementary Group Project has recently become a hot project in the international investment market, attracting widespread attention from various sectors.

The Luliang region's project is a key project for strengthening the energy and heavy chemical industry base in Shanxi Province. From its inception to development, it has received high attention and support from the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Metallurgy. Shanxi Province has established a leading group for the project, headed by Deputy Governor Wujunzhou. Since March last year, it has been in contact with the Asian Development Bank, and within nine months, it has signed a preliminary investment development agreement, forming a huge investment intention.

The group project includes the Xiaoliu Railway, Liu Lin Power Plant, Luliang Coke Plant, and Luliang Calcium Carbide Plant. The ADB initially proposed an investment of $177.78 million. Among these, the $39.7 million loan for the Xiaoliu Railway has been officially effective since July 30 this year; the $65 million ADB loan for the Liu Lin Power Plant is currently in negotiations; the $57.3 million loan for the coke plant and the $15.78 million loan for the calcium carbide plant are undergoing project approval procedures.

Relevant departments, after investigation, demonstration, and calculation comparison, believe that this group project has good economic benefits and quick investment recovery. The group project implements comprehensive utilization of resources, simultaneous development of construction, unified arrangement of funds, and complementary economic benefits. The railway and power plant lay the foundation and create conditions for coking and calcium carbide, while coking and calcium carbide create foreign exchange earnings for the group project to repay loans, forming a complementary effect. The coking and calcium carbide projects generate $73.351 million in foreign exchange annually, repaying the ADB loans while generating $19.63 million in net foreign exchange for the country each year.

Currently, the Luliang region has formulated 14 preferential policies, welcoming domestic and foreign businesspeople to continue investing and developing.

　　资源统筹利用　经济效益互补
　　吕梁综合开发项目前景好
    本报讯　吕梁综合互补集团项目近来成为国际投资市场热门的项目，受到各界的广泛重视。
    吕梁地区的这一项目，是加强山西省能源重化工基地建设的拳头项目。从设项到开发都得到国家计委、能源部、地矿部、铁道部和冶金部等部门的高度重视和支持。山西省成立了以副省长吴俊洲为组长的集团项目领导组。从去年3月开始和亚洲开发银行接触，9个月内就草签了投资开发协议，形成了巨额投资意向。
    该集团项目包括孝柳铁路、柳林电厂、吕梁焦化厂、吕梁电石厂4个。亚行初拟投资17778万美元，其中孝柳铁路的3970万美元贷款从今年7月30日起已正式生效；柳林电厂的6500万美元的亚行贷款，近期内谈判；焦化厂的5730万美元和电石厂的1578万美元贷款，正在办理立项审批手续。
    有关部门经考察论证、测算对比，认为这个集团项目经济效益好，投资回收快。集团项目实行资源综合利用，建设同步发展，资金统筹安排，经济效益互补。铁路和电厂为焦化和电石奠定基础创造条件，焦化和电石为集团项目出口创汇偿还贷款，形成互补效应。焦化电石两个项目年创汇为7335.1万美元，在偿还亚行贷款的同时，每年可为国家净创汇1963万美元。
    目前，吕梁地区已制定了14条优惠政策，欢迎中外实业家继续前去投资开发。
