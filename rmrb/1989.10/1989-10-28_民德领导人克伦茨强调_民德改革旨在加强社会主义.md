East German leader Krenz emphasizes that East German reforms aim to strengthen socialism

	BERLIN, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) — East German leader Krenz emphasized that the reforms in East Germany are aimed at making socialism stronger and more attractive on German soil.

	Krenz made the remarks on Oct. 25 when he met with the chairman of the Free Democratic Party's parliamentary group in West Germany, Miesnik.

	During the meeting, Krenz briefed his guest on the outcomes of the recent 9th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the current situation in East Germany. He said that the changes underway in East Germany are intended to benefit the people. The reforms will further improve economic efficiency, expand socialist democracy, and increase the possibilities for the working people to exercise their power through their elected urban and rural people's representative bodies.

	Krenz also pointed out that Western proposals for reforms aimed at undermining the socialist system in East Germany will never be realized.

	Regarding bilateral relations, Krenz stressed the importance of adhering to the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. For the future of the European house, it is essential to ensure that fascism will never again arise on German soil and that war will never again occur. He expressed concern about the growth of neo-Nazi and revanchist forces in West Germany.

	Krenz emphasized that East Germany is an independent sovereign state with a 40-year history in the heart of Europe. Both German states are responsible for their own territories and citizens, which is internationally recognized. He criticized West Germany's insistence on having the right to protect all Germans and hoped that West Germany would take action to remove obstacles in the relationship between the two countries.

	Miesnik said that he was closely following the recent developments in East Germany. He agreed with many of Krenz's points and expressed the hope for continued cooperation between the two German states.

	The chairman of the Free Democratic Party and vice-chairman of the State Council of East Germany, Grach, also attended the meeting.

　　民德领导人克伦茨强调
　　民德改革旨在加强社会主义
    本报柏林10月26日电　记者许宏治报道：德国统一社会党中央总书记、民主德国国务委员会主席克伦茨指出，民德的改革是为了使社会主义在德国土地上更加强大，更有吸引力。
    克伦茨是25日在会见西德自由民主党联邦议会党团主席米什尼克时这样说的。
    会见时，克伦茨向客人介绍了不久前召开的德国统一社会党9中全会的成果以及民德当前形势。他说，民德开始的变革以造福人民为目的。改革将进一步提高经济效益，扩大社会主义民主，扩大劳动人民通过他们选举产生的城乡人民代表机构行使权力的可能性。
    克伦茨还指出，西方建议民德进行那种旨在动摇社会主义制度的改革，这在将来也决不可能实现。
    在谈到双边关系时，克伦茨指出，应坚持不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策。为了全欧大厦的未来，必须坚持在德国土地上永远不能再产生法西斯主义，永远不能再发生战争。他对联邦德国新纳粹和复仇主义势力的滋长表示关切。
    克伦茨强调，民主德国是欧洲中部一个已有40年历史的独立的主权国家。两个德国中的任何一个都对自己的领土和公民负责，这是国际上公认的。他批评西德坚持自己“有权对所有德国人提供保护”的立场，希望西德为消除两国关系中的障碍而采取行动。
    米什尼克表示，他以很大兴趣注视着民德近来局势的发展。他对克伦茨所说的不少话表示同意，并表示希望继续保持两个德国之间的合作。
    德国自由民主党主席、民主德国国务委员会副主席格拉赫参加了会见。
