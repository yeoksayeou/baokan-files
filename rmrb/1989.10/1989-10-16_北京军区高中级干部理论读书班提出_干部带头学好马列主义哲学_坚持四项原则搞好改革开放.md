    The Beijing Military Region high-level cadres' theoretical study class has proposed that cadres should lead in studying Marxist-Leninist philosophy, uphold the four cardinal principles, and promote reform and opening up.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 14th - (Reporters Zhao Su, Chen Hui) "Upholding the four cardinal principles and building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the inevitable law of China's historical development and the only correct choice." This is the common conclusion reached by over a hundred high-level cadres participating in the Beijing Military Region's theoretical study class after in-depth study of Marxist philosophy.

    The Beijing Military Region high-level cadres' theoretical study class, which concluded today, focused on studying the philosophical works of Marxism, Deng Xiaoping's speeches on upholding the four cardinal principles, and Jiang Zemin's National Day speech. The class organized participants to use Marxist philosophical thought to analyze and summarize the experiences and lessons of the past decade of reform and opening up. Through the study, everyone felt that Marxist philosophy and Deng Xiaoping's philosophical works are our weapons for observing and understanding things, and are important guarantees for achieving success in reform and construction. High-level cadres should regard Marxist philosophy as a compulsory course and take the lead in studying it thoroughly.

    During the study and discussion, everyone used Marxist philosophical viewpoints to deepen their understanding of the Party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism, further recognizing the dialectical unity between upholding the four cardinal principles and promoting reform and opening up.

    北京军区高中级干部理论读书班提出
    干部带头学好马列主义哲学  坚持四项原则搞好改革开放
    据新华社北京10月14日电　（记者赵苏、陈辉）“坚持四项基本原则，建设有中国特色的社会主义，是中国历史发展的必然规律，是唯一正确的选择。”这是参加北京军区理论读书班的百余名高中级干部深入学习马克思主义哲学后，得出的共同结论。
    今天结束的北京军区高中级干部理论读书班，以学习马克思主义的哲学著作、邓小平同志关于坚持四项基本原则的论述和江泽民同志国庆讲话为主要内容，组织大家运用马克思主义的哲学思想，分析总结改革开放10年来带有规律性的经验教训。通过学习，大家感到，马克思主义哲学和邓小平同志充满哲学思想的论著，是我们观察、认识事物的思想武器，是取得改革和建设成功的重要保证，高中级干部要把马克思主义哲学做为必修课，带头学好。
    学习讨论中，大家运用马克思主义的哲学观点，深化对党的社会主义初级阶段基本路线的认识，进一步认清了坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放两者的辩证统一关系。
