Good teachings must be delivered by good practitioners, "stand by them and bolster their courage," "don't add troubles for them below." — These are the heartfelt words of three county committee secretaries from Henan Province's Gong County, Yichuan, and Gusong. They deeply understand the importance of the work of the broad grassroots cadres, as well as their difficulties and hardships. Therefore, they have taken various measures to help grassroots cadres alleviate their worries and difficulties, which is very meaningful.

Grassroots cadres are the frontline commanders who implement the Party and government's lines, principles, and policies. They are also the "direct superiors" that the masses come into contact with at any time, indeed the key figures.

"From above, there are a thousand threads, but below, there is only one needle." Many things are done well or poorly, often determined by this "needle," by the enthusiasm, sense of responsibility, and work ability of the broad grassroots cadres. Their every word and deed also influence the surrounding masses. Take this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot as an example. In places and units where grassroots cadres are competent, the masses did not get involved or were rarely involved. In some places and units, the grassroots cadres themselves were not upright, and the masses followed suit. This is a profound lesson. In the past few years, bourgeois liberalization spread, bringing a very bad influence on grassroots work. Some places had the problem of neglecting Party building and weakening Party leadership. Some rural Party branches and village committees were even in a state of paralysis, making it difficult for the spirit from above to be implemented below, and many things below difficult to do well. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, this situation is changing. Party building and ideological work are receiving attention, and the work enthusiasm of the broad grassroots cadres is continuously improving.

To care for grassroots cadres, first of all, we must have a realistic assessment of them, recognizing that the vast majority of grassroots cadres are good or relatively good. They have worked in the fields, streets, and alleys for many years, diligently and tirelessly, which is not easy. For the shortcomings and mistakes in their work, we must first help them correct them enthusiastically, not neglect them, and manage them reasonably. As for those who seriously violate laws and disciplines, they must be dealt with according to laws and disciplines. But such people are indeed a very small number, and they do not represent the broad grassroots cadres.

The most important thing in caring for grassroots cadres is to care for them in terms of ideology and politics, making them good Party members and good cadres. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently at the national commendation conference for advanced grassroots Party organizations and outstanding Party affairs workers, put forward requirements for the broad Party affairs workers: "They should be loyal executors of the Party's lines, principles, and policies, propagandists and organizers who implement the Party's correct propositions to the masses, demonstrators of the Party's fine traditions and styles, and also active participants and promoters of reform and opening up." This should also be the requirement for the broad grassroots cadres. Now, many places are using county and township Party schools or other forms to train grassroots cadres, studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches and Comrade Jiang Zemin's National Day speech. The atmosphere of strengthening Party building and ideological and political work has formed, creating good conditions for the broad grassroots cadres to carry out their work.

The broad grassroots cadres should also recognize the importance of their positions, the glory of their work, and their own shortcomings, and strive even harder to serve the people in the future. The Party has high hopes for the broad grassroots cadres, and the people will not forget their hard work.

    “好经还得和尚念”，“为他们撑腰壮胆”，“别给下头添麻烦”。
    ——这是河南巩县、伊川、固始三位县委书记就理解、爱护、支持基层干部说的一番心里话。他们深知广大基层干部工作的重要，也深知其难处、苦处，于是就千方百计采取措施为基层干部分忧解难，这样做是很有意义的。
    基层干部是贯彻党和政府路线、方针、政策的前线指挥员，又是群众随时随地要接触的“顶头上司”，确实是兵头将尾。
  “上头千条线，下头一根针”，许多事情办好办坏，往往决定于这一根“针”，决定于广大基层干部的积极性、责任心和工作能力。他们的一言一行也在影响着周围的群众。以这次动乱和反革命暴乱为例，凡是基层干部得力的地方和单位，群众就没有卷进去或很少卷进去，而在有些地方和单位，基层干部本身不正不硬，群众就跟着卷进去。这是深刻的教训。前几年资产阶级自由化泛滥，给基层工作带来了极坏的影响，有的地方出现了忽视党的建设、淡化党的领导的问题，一些农村的党支部和村民委员会甚至处于瘫痪状态，这就使上头的精神难以贯彻下去，下头的许多事情也难以办好。党的十三届四中全会以后，这种状况正在改变，党的建设和思想工作受到重视，广大基层干部的工作积极性不断提高。
    关心基层干部，首先要对他们有一个实事求是的估计，要认识到绝大多数基层干部是好的和比较好的。他们多年来工作在田间地头，大街小巷，兢兢业业、任劳任怨，很不容易。对他们工作中的缺点和错误，首先要热情地帮助改正，不能放任不管，管要管得合情合理。至于对那些严重违法乱纪的人，则要依法纪论处。但这种人毕竟是极少数，他们不代表广大基层干部。
    关心基层干部，最重要的是从思想上、政治上关心，使他们成为好党员、好干部。江泽民同志最近在全国先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者表彰大会上，对广大党务工作者提出要求：“他们应当是党的路线、方针、政策的忠实执行者，是把党的正确主张贯彻到群众中去的宣传者和组织者，是党的优良传统和作风的示范者，也是改革开放的积极参加者和推动者。”这也应该是对广大基层干部的要求。现在许多地方正在利用县、乡党校或其它形式培训基层干部，学习党的十三届四中全会文件，学习邓小平同志重要讲话和江泽民同志的国庆讲话，加强党的建设和加强思想政治工作的气候已经形成，为广大基层干部开展工作创造了良好条件。
    广大基层干部也要认识到自己岗位的重要、工作的光荣和自己的差距，今后更加努力地为人民服务。党对广大基层干部寄予殷切的希望，人民更不会忘记他们的辛劳。
