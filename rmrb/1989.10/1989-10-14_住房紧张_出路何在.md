Housing is one of the major issues plaguing humanity. On October 2, United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar stated during the commemoration of "World Habitat Day" that currently, over 1 billion people worldwide lack adequate housing, several hundred million people live in squalid slums, and 100 million people are homeless, sleeping on the streets.

In Africa, over 60% of the residents endure miserable lives in overcrowded slums; in Latin America, at least 20 million young people and children sleep on the streets at night. Even in developed countries, there are a significant number of homeless people. Reports indicate that the United States currently has 3 million homeless people, and this number is increasing at a rate of 20% per year; in the United Kingdom, there are over 100,000 households without housing; in the French capital Paris, 10,000 people wander the streets, homeless and helpless. Data shows that in today's Western Europe, the number of people without permanent residences is at least 1 million.

From this, it is clear that both developing and developed countries, whether capitalist or socialist, are facing housing problems to varying degrees.

The primary cause of housing shortages is the rapid growth of the world's population, coupled with the urbanization trend, which has exacerbated the housing crisis in cities. In 1950, the world's population was only 2.513 billion, but this year, it has reached 5.2 billion. Around 1800, the urban population was less than 3% of the world's total population. By 1950, this figure had risen to 25%. It is estimated that by the year 2000, the urban population will, for the first time in human history, surpass the rural population. The situation in developing countries is even more worrying. Due to the massive influx of rural populations into cities, urban populations have reached explosive levels. The Executive Director of the United Nations Population and Housing Commission, Ramaswami Ramamurthy, recently pointed out that in the next 10 years, the urban population in third-world countries will account for 3/4 of the total population in these countries, resulting in many cities being "overloaded." Calcutta in India, for example, can accommodate at most 2 million people, but currently, 11 million people are crammed into it, struggling to make a living. People flock to the cities, but houses do not fall from the sky. Therefore, many people who move to the cities can only find shelter in slums and alleyways.

Some countries have reduced housing construction funds and cut subsidies for low- and middle-income earners, which is another factor contributing to housing difficulties. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union had one of the highest per capita housing areas in the world, but by the eleventh five-year plan, the proportion of housing investment had dropped from 23.2% in the sixth five-year plan to 15.5%, and the housing problem was exposed. In contrast, some countries' military expenditures have been increasing, directly affecting housing construction. American arms control expert Seymour Melman recently pointed out that currently, the world's military spending is $1.9 million per minute. If 10% of the military budget were used for housing construction, the housing problem would not be so severe. No wonder Americans from various states traveled thousands of miles to Washington to rally and march, urging the government to cut military spending and increase housing investment.

Some developing countries have very serious housing shortages, but housing construction investment only accounts for 3% to 8% of the GDP.

The housing problem has become a global issue. It directly affects people's lives and social development. Therefore, all countries are taking measures to address the housing problem.

Cooperative housing construction is a method being adopted by many countries. It is completed through housing cooperatives. Housing cooperatives are voluntarily formed by urban middle- and low-income earners, who solve their own housing problems through equity financing. It originated in 19th-century Europe and has developed rapidly in the past 10 years. Now, such cooperatives are found in more than 70 countries across five continents. Due to different situations in various countries, the equity funds for joining cooperatives and the handling of housing ownership are not the same: some ownership belongs to individuals, while others belong to cooperatives. The main sources of funds are members' equity, government or bank loans, and national or local government subsidies. In Sweden, 1/6 of the housing belongs to cooperatives; in Poland, housing cooperatives own 68% of the national public housing. The Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, and other countries have also achieved remarkable results in cooperative housing construction.

Saving for housing is another effective method. Residents use their savings to buy or build houses, solving their personal housing problems and reducing the state's burden. Yugoslavian national laws stipulate that all employees must deduct 6.5% of their personal income for housing construction funds; Singapore implements a provident fund system, where all employed workers must contribute a portion of their salary to the provident fund each month; Egypt promotes a national housing savings card system, where children can start saving 1.86 Egyptian pounds per month from the age of one, and by the time they get married, they can choose a satisfactory house.

Encouraging and subsidizing private housing construction and purchase is another important way to attract residents' funds and solve the housing problem. In capitalist countries, private housing construction is supported, while socialist countries, although starting later, have developed rapidly. The Czechoslovakian government increased subsidies for private housing construction starting from June this year, with the basic subsidy for private housing construction increased from 35,000 koruna to 50,000 koruna, and the subsidy for young couples can be increased to 150,000 koruna. The government also provides preferential loans and material subsidies to individuals, and exempts property taxes for 15 years. The Soviet Union has also carried out reforms in this regard. Last year, the Soviet Union passed three decisions, allowing urban residents to apply for loans of up to 20,000 rubles from banks if their housing construction funds are insufficient, with urban residents repaying within 25 years and rural residents extending to 50 years. Last year, the housing completed by individuals and cooperatives in the Soviet Union accounted for 23% of the total completed area for the year, and it is estimated that by 1995, this figure will reach over 60%.

Solving the housing problem through multiple channels is becoming a global trend. If practical measures are taken, housing construction is given importance, and population growth is controlled, the global housing problem can be alleviated.

    住房紧张　出路何在
    何崇元
    住房问题是人类面临的重重困扰之一。
    联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔10月2日在纪念“世界住房日”时说，目前，世界上没有足够住房的人有10亿多，挤在居住条件恶劣的贫民窟中的也有几亿，还有1亿人露宿街头，无家可归。
    在非洲，60％以上的居民在拥挤的贫民窟里苦度岁月；在拉丁美洲，至少有2000万青年和儿童晚上睡在大街上。即使发达国家也同样存在为数可观的无家可归者。据报道，美国目前有300万无家可归者，而且还在以每年20％的速度增加；英国无住房的家庭达10万户以上；法国首都巴黎也有1万人流浪街头，漂泊无依。有材料表明，今天的西欧，无固定住所的人数至少有100万之众。
    由此看来，无论是发展中国家还是发达国家，无论是资本主义国家还是社会主义国家均面临着程度不等的住房问题。
    造成住房紧张的主要原因在于世界人口增长过快，而人口涌向城市，世界日益城市化，使城市住房更形紧张。1950年，世界人口只有25.13亿，而今年，世界人口已达到52亿；1800年前后，城市人口不到世界总人口的3％，1950年，猛升到占25％，预料，到2000年，世界城市人口在人类历史上将第一次超过农村人口。发展中国家目前的情况更令人担忧。由于农村人口大量拥入城市，城市人口已达到爆炸的程度。联合国人口和住房委员会执行主任拉马山德兰前不久指出，今后10年内，第三世界国家城市人口将占这些国家总人数的3／4，其结果将使许多城市“超负荷”。印度的加尔各答充其量只能容纳200万人左右，但目前却有1100万人挤在里面谋生。人蜂拥而来，房子却不能从天而降。于是，许多拥入城市的人只好栖身贫民窟和街头巷尾。
    有些国家压缩住宅建设资金，削减对中低收入者的住房补贴，是造成住房困难的另一个因素。苏联50年代后期和60年代初，人均住宅面积一直居世界前列，但到第十一个五年计划时，住宅投资比重从第六个五年计划的23.2％降到15.5％，住房问题随之也就暴露出来了。相反，一些国家的军费却一个劲地增长，直接影响了住宅建设。美国军备控制专家西瓦德最近指出，现在，全世界每分钟的军费开支为190万美元，如果把10％的军费用于住宅建设，住宅问题也不至于紧张到这个程度。难怪美国人千里迢迢地从各州跑到华盛顿集会游行，呼吁政府削减军费，增加住房投资。
    有些发展中国家住宅紧张问题非常严重，但住宅建设投资却只占国内生产总值的3％至8％。
    住房问题已成为一个世界性问题。它直接关系到人们的生活和社会的发展。所以，各国都在采取措施，设法解决住房问题。
    合作建房是许多国家正在采用的一种方式。它是通过住宅合作社来完成的。住宅合作社由城镇的中、低收入者自愿组成，通过入股集资的方式，解决自身的住房问题。它诞生于19世纪的欧洲，最近10年发展很快。现在，这种合作社已遍布世界五大洲的70多个国家。由于各国情况不一，加入合作社的入股资金和住房产权的处理也不尽相同：有的产权归私人所有，有的产权归合作社所有，但资金主要来源于社员的入股资金、政府或银行贷款以及国家或地方政府的补贴。瑞典现在1／6的住宅属合作社所建；波兰住宅合作社拥有的住宅占了全国公有住宅的68％。联邦德国、意大利等国在合作建房方面也取得了令人瞩目的成就。
    储蓄建房也是一种行之有效的办法。居民用平时的储蓄购房、建房，既解决了个人住房问题又减轻了国家负担。南斯拉夫国家法律规定，所有职工必须扣交6.5％的个人收入作为住宅建设基金；新加坡实行公积金制度，凡参加工作的雇员，每月必须按工资比例缴纳公积金；埃及则在全国推行住房储蓄卡制度，只要小孩从1岁起每月存入1.86埃镑，等到结婚时，便可选择一套满意的住宅。
    鼓励和补贴私人建房、购房也是吸收居民资金，解决住房问题的一个重要途径。在资本主义国家，私人建房是受到扶持的，社会主义国家在这方面虽然起步较晚，但发展较快。捷克斯洛伐克政府从今年6月起增加了对私人建房的补贴，私人建房的基本补助款从3.5万克朗增加到5万克朗，青年夫妇的补贴可提高到15万克朗。政府还向私人提供优惠贷款和建材补贴，15年内免收房税。苏联在这方面也进行了改革。去年，苏联通过了3个决定，城市居民建房资金不足的，可向银行申请2万卢布以内的贷款，城市居民25年内偿还，乡村居民可延长为50年。去年，苏联个人和合作社所建的住房已占当年竣工总面积的23％，有人预料，到1995年，这个数字将达到60％以上。
    通过多种渠道解决住宅问题正成为一个世界性趋势。如果能采取实际措施，重视住房建设，同时注意控制人口增长，世界住房问题是可以得到缓解的。
