Beijing's autumn sports events are in full swing. On October 8, three major domestic and international competitions will open in three different sports venues in the capital. These events are the first Asian Fencing Championship, the 1989 Beijing International Athletics Meet (which will only take place in the afternoon of the 8th), and the 1989 National Table Tennis Championship.

Fencing, which originated and became popular in Europe, has seen significant development in Asia in recent years. The Asian Fencing Union decided to hold the first Asian Championship in Beijing. This decision aims to give fencers from various countries an opportunity to warm up and familiarize themselves with the venue for the upcoming Asian Games, while also allowing the Chinese fencing community to gain experience in hosting international events. The Asian Championship, which will run from the 8th to the 13th, is expected to attract 10 teams with over 110 athletes competing for 10 gold medals in individual and team events. The Chinese team is the strongest in Asia, followed by South Korea and Japan. To ensure fair competition, two experienced European referees have been invited to officiate key matches.

The Beijing International Athletics Meet features 30 events, with athletes from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Romania, Japan, North Korea, and China's national athletics training team preparing for the Asian Games all competing together. Although the number of foreign athletes is small, several notable athletes will participate, such as the world record holder and Olympic champion in women's shot put from the Soviet Union, Ilona Lisovskaya, and the world's second-best female discus thrower from East Germany, Ilke Wyludda. They will compete against China's top athletes, Huang Zhi Hong and Hou Xue Mei, among others. Additionally, the women's high jump event promises to be exciting, with China's Jin Ling, Japan's Satō Megumi, and the Soviet Union's Yelena Yelesina all having similar strengths, with their best performances ranging between 1.95 meters and 1.98 meters, making the outcome unpredictable.

The National Table Tennis Championship brings together all the top players in the country, including Chen Longcan, Ma Wenge, Chen Jing, and Qiao Hong. The competition in the seven events is expected to be fierce. This championship is likely to be an important event for China's table tennis community to reorganize, discover new talent, discuss strategies, and look towards the future.

Additionally, from October 16 to 24, the newly completed Beijing International Tennis Center will host the East Asian Tennis Team Championship and the Asian Tennis Championship, with 11 national and regional teams already registered to participate.

    北京深秋体育大赛接二连三
    亚洲击剑锦标赛北京国际田径赛等同日开幕
    本报讯　记者刘小明报道：深秋的北京，体育竞赛格外繁忙。10月8日一天，将有三项国内外重要赛事在京城三个体育场馆开幕。它们是第一届亚洲击剑锦标赛，1989年北京国际田径赛（只8日下午进行半天），1989年全国乒乓球锦标赛。
    起源并风行于欧洲的击剑运动近年来在亚洲有长足的发展，亚洲剑联决定把首届亚洲锦标赛放在北京举行，一方面可以使剑坛各路健儿有个互相热身并熟悉明年亚运会赛场的机会，一方面让中国击剑界积累举办国际大赛的经验。从8日至13日举行的这次亚洲大赛预计有10个队110余名运动员参加，将争夺个人和团体共10枚金牌。中国队在亚洲剑坛实力最强，其次为南朝鲜队、日本队。为了公正比赛起见，本次比赛特邀请两名有经验的欧洲裁判员担任重要场次的主裁。
    北京国际田径赛共设有30个项目，来自苏联、民主德国、罗马尼亚、日本、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等国家的选手和我国准备亚运会的田径集训队运动员将同场角逐。外国选手虽人数不多，但颇有几位著名运动员。如女子铅球世界纪录保持者、奥运会冠军苏联的利索夫斯卡亚，女子铁饼今年世界第二、民主德国的麦兹恩斯基。这次比赛她们将同我国优秀选手黄志红、侯雪梅等一比高低。此外，女子跳高比赛也很有看头，中国的金玲、日本的佐藤惠、苏联的叶列辛娜三人实力相当，最好成绩均在1.95米——1.98米之间，胜负难料。
    全国乒乓球锦标赛云集了目前国内所有高手，包括陈龙灿、马文革、陈静、乔红等。七个项目的竞争必将十分激烈。这次比赛很可能成为一次我国乒坛重整队伍、发现人才、商讨对策、面向未来的重要盛会。
    另外，10月16日至24日在新落成的北京国际网球中心，将举办东亚网球团体赛暨亚洲网球锦标赛，已有11个国家和地区的代表队报名参赛。
