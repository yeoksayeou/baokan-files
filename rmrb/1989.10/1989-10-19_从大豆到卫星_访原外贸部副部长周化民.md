The autumn sun shines into a modest office in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. Former Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Zhou Huamin is here to receive an interview from the reporter.

As one of the first generation of China's foreign trade workers and a veteran vice minister who has been in charge of the country's import and export work for 17 years, 75-year-old Zhou has witnessed and participated in the arduous and tortuous process of China's foreign trade development.

He metaphorically describes this historical leap as "from soybeans to satellites."

I

Countless memories are like smoke.

However, in the nearly 100 years since the Opium War, China suffered from the plunder of imperialists, accumulated poverty and weakness, and was on the brink of destruction. This not only directly drove Zhou Huamin to join the revolution in 1938 but also left a deep wound in his heart that he cannot erase. Even now, recalling it still feels like a piercing humiliation.

Flipping through the yellowed pages of China's foreign trade history, it is recorded: From 1878 to 1949, over 70 years, China's foreign trade was in a severe deficit situation. Nothing could better illustrate the problem than these words: foreign rice, foreign flour, foreign sugar, foreign cloth, foreign oil, foreign matches, foreign nails, foreign paper, foreign soap, small foreign houses, and even foreign guns and cannons, all had to be imported!

The struggling national industry could not meet domestic demand, let alone compete in the international market. The foreign exchange needed for imports could only be barely filled by traditional agricultural and sideline products represented by soybeans. Before the "September 18 Incident" in 1931, China's top export was soybeans, followed by raw silk, furs, eggs, tea, tung oil, and metals; before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, soybean exports ranked second only to various ores; during the Liberation War in 1946, apart from salt, tung oil, and various ores, soybeans still ranked fourth among export goods.

Soybeans, the main export goods of China, were mainly these soybeans used for oil extraction...

II

After the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, China's history turned over a new page. Zhou divides the 40 years of foreign trade development into four stages.

The first stage was from 1950 to 1960. During these 10 years, the focus of foreign trade work was to promote national industrialization. At that time, the U.S. imperialists and others imposed military threats and economic blockades on us, with a wide range of embargoes. Not only were advanced technologies and key equipment prohibited from being exported to us, but even rubber and non-ferrous metals were on the embargo list. China had to adopt the "leaning to one side" approach, mainly conducting trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, importing complete sets of equipment to form its own production capacity.

The transformation of Anshan Steel, the establishment of the First Automobile Works, and the heavy machinery, instrumentation, and tractor manufacturing industries, among others, all laid the foundation during that time, known as the "156 Projects," which were actually the introduction of technology and the import of large-scale complete sets of equipment.

Then what did China use to exchange these technologies and equipment? Soybeans, pork, and oil and fat, these traditional agricultural and sideline products played a big role. At its peak, soybeans were exported at 20 million tons per year.

The second stage was from 1960 to 1966. These few years were the hardest. Not only did the imperialists strangle us, but with the deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union withdrew experts and tore up contracts, causing serious damage to China's economy. Domestically, natural disasters and man-made calamities led to food shortages in many places. At that time, three main tasks were undertaken:

The first was to import grain to stabilize market prices, reduce procurement, and consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants;

The second was to repay the $2 billion debt to the Soviet Union. The entire nation tightened their belts and supported foreign trade, finally repaying the foreign debt by the last deadline of the first quarter of 1965;

The third was to open channels for importing technology and equipment from developed countries. The Beijing Vinylon Plant was the first large-scale equipment imported from a developed country in the 1960s using deferred payment methods.

The third stage was from 1966 to 1978. During the Cultural Revolution, the Ministry of Foreign Trade was a heavily affected area, but due to the support and care of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, the department's party committee continued to lead the work, and the import and export trade developed to a certain extent, which was precious.

At that time, many important technologies were imported from Western countries, including complete sets of equipment. The original plan was to spend a total of $4.3 billion, hence the name "4.3 Plan." Later, this amount was exceeded. The most famous ones included the cold-rolled equipment for Wuhan Steel imported from West Germany and the hot-rolled equipment from Japan, a total of 13 large-scale fertilizer plants with an annual production capacity of 13 million tons, and 6 sets of chemical fiber equipment.

The fourth stage was from 1979 to the present. Under the guidance of the reform and opening-up policy, China began to march towards modernization, and foreign trade work promoted this goal and also benefited from it. In 1988, the export earnings were $4.0639 billion, more than three times that of 1978 and 73 times that of 1950; in 1950, China's foreign trade volume was only $1.135 billion, but by 1988 it had reached $8.0489 billion, growing 70 times in 39 years, or in other words, the export earnings of 1950 were equivalent to only 5.5 days of exports in 1988; the total import and export volume of 1950 was equivalent to only 6.5 days of the amount in 1988.

The structure of imported and exported goods has also improved significantly. Most imported goods are advanced technologies, equipment, and raw materials necessary for domestic production and construction, while exported goods have gradually shifted from agricultural and sideline products and mineral products to industrial manufactured goods, and have begun to export technology. China's hybrid rice, freshwater fish farming, blast furnace coal powder injection, computer software, medical and health care technologies, and others have been successively exported to developed countries. The commercial negotiations for launching artificial satellites for other countries using our own manufactured rockets undoubtedly mark China's complete ability to enter the international commercial satellite launch market, which is monopolized by a few developed countries.

III

In 40 years, China's foreign trade industry has achieved remarkable results that have attracted worldwide attention. In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, China had trade relations with only a few dozen countries, which has now expanded to more than 180 countries and regions. In 1978, China's exports ranked 32nd in the world, but by 1988, it had jumped to 14th. Currently, China's foreign trade team has reached 500,000 people. According to rough estimates, in 1988, more than 20% of China's total industrial output value was realized through foreign trade, and foreign trade has become a very important factor in economic growth.

The introduction by Director Zhao Chunhua and Deputy Director Teng Sanbo of the Technology Import and Export Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade made Zhou's summary of "from soybeans to satellites" more complete and substantial. They said that since the founding of the People's Republic, in the 30 years from the 1950s to the 1970s, the total amount of technology introduced by the state reached $15 billion, which contributed to the establishment of an independent socialist industrial system in China on the basis of "poverty and blankness." In the 1980s, the scale of technology introduction expanded rapidly, with flexible and diverse methods, diversified sources of introduction, and a total expenditure of $20.55 billion, introducing nearly 3,600 items of technology, greatly narrowing the gap between China and developed countries in the world. The original industrial main body was at the level of the 1950s, but now it has at least developed to the level of the 1970s. The import of production capacity improvement and tax increase enables the state to invest more funds in education, scientific research, and technological development, which in turn promotes the optimization of export structure and the improvement of foreign exchange earnings, and is conducive to the introduction of more technology and equipment. Such a virtuous cycle has begun to appear.

    从大豆到卫星
    ——访原外贸部副部长周化民
    本报记者　刘霄
    金秋的阳光，照进经贸部一间朴素的办公室。原外贸部副部长周化民在这里接受记者采访。
    作为新中国第一代对外贸易工作者，作为曾分管国家进出口工作达17年之久的老资格副部长，75岁的周老目睹并参与了我国外贸事业艰难曲折开拓过程。
    他把这一历史性的跨越，形象地喻为“从大豆到卫星”。
    一
    多少往事如烟。
    但是自鸦片战争以来的近百年中，中国遭到列强鲸吞蚕食，积贫积弱，满目疮痍，几近亡国的惨状，不仅是周化民1938年投身革命的直接驱策力，也是他内心深处抹不去的创伤。至今回忆起来，仍然感到一种刺目椎心的耻辱。
    翻开业已发黄的中国外贸史册，上面赫然记载道：自1878年至1949年的70余年间，我国的对外贸易，一直处于严重的入超状况。没有比这些字眼更能说明问题的了：洋米、洋面、洋糖、洋布、洋油、洋火、洋钉、洋纸、洋胰子、小洋楼，直到洋枪、洋炮，无一不靠进口！
    气息奄奄的民族工业根本无法满足国内需求，更没有余力去国际市场一争短长了。进口所需的外汇开支只能用大豆为代表的传统农副土特产品勉强填补。1931年“九·一八”事变前，我国每年出口居第一位的是大豆，其次为生丝、皮货、蛋类、茶叶、桐油、金属类；1937年抗日战争爆发前，大豆出口量仅次于各种矿砂而居第二位；1946年解放战争期间，除盐、桐油和各种矿砂外，大豆仍居出口物资中的第四位。
    大豆，我国出口的货物主要是这种被用来榨油的大豆……
    二
    1949年建国以后，我国历史掀开了崭新的一页。周老把40年来的外贸发展分为四个阶段。
    第一阶段从1950年到1960年。这10年中，外贸工作的中心就是推动国家的工业化。当时美帝国主义等对我军事威胁和经济封锁并用，禁运范围极为广泛，不但尖端技术和关键设备禁止对我出口，就连橡胶和有色金属都在禁运之列。我国只有采取“一边倒”的方式，主要与苏联和东欧国家进行贸易，进口成套设备，形成自己的生产能力。
    鞍钢的改造，一汽的建立以及重型机器工业、仪器仪表工业、拖拉机制造业等等都是那个时候打下的基础，号称“156项工程”，实际是引进技术和进口大型成套设备。
    那么我国拿什么去换这些技术和设备呢？大豆、猪肉、油脂等传统农副产品立了大功。大豆最多时年出口200万吨。
    第二阶段从1960年到1966年。这几年日子最为难过。不但帝国主义卡我们，随着中苏关系恶化，苏联撤走专家，撕毁合同，给我国经济造成严重损失。国内天灾人祸，很多地方粮食紧缺。当时主要抓了三件事：
    第一件是进口粮食，稳定市场物价，减少征购，巩固工农联盟；
    第二件是偿还苏联20亿美元的债务，全国人民节衣缩食支援外贸，终于在1965年第一季度最后期限前全部还清了外债；
    第三件是打开从发达国家引进技术设备的渠道。北京的维尼龙厂就是60年代采取延期付款方式从发达国家进口的第一套大型设备。
    第三阶段从1966年到1978年。“文革”中，外贸部是重灾区，但是由于毛主席和周总理的支持和关怀，部党组仍继续领导业务，工作没有间断，进出口贸易得到了一定的发展，这是难能可贵的。
    当时从西方国家进口了很多重要的技术，包括成套设备，原来准备总支出43亿美元，故尔叫“四三方案”，后来超过了。其中最著名的有武钢从联邦德国引进的冷轧设备和从日本引进的热轧设备，总共年产可达1300万吨的13套大化肥厂，还有6套化纤设备。
    第四阶段从1979年至今。在改革开放方针的指导下，我国开始向现代化迈进，外贸工作推动了这一目标，也得益于这一目标。1988年出口创汇406.39亿美元，相当于1978年的3倍多，1950年的73倍多；1950年我国对外贸易额仅为11.35亿美元，1988年已达到804.89亿美元，39年中增长了70倍，换言之，1950年一年的出口创汇额，仅相当于1988年5天半的出口额；1950年全年的进出口额，仅为1988年6天半的金额。
    进出口商品结构也有明显的改善。进口商品绝大部分是国内生产建设所必需的先进技术、设备和原材料，而出口商品逐步由农副产品和矿产品为主转向工业制成品为主，并且开始技术出口。我国的杂交水稻、淡水鱼养殖、高炉喷煤粉、计算机软件、医疗卫生保健等技术，已陆续向发达国家出口。而用我们自己制造的火箭为他国发射人造卫星的商业洽谈，则无可争辩地标志着我国完全有能力进入为少数发达国家垄断的国际商用卫星发射市场。
    三
    40年我国外贸事业取得成就举世瞩目。建国初期同我国有贸易关系的仅几十个国家，现在扩大到180多个国家和地区。1978年我国出口在世界各国居32位，1988年跃居第14位。目前，我国外贸队伍达50万人。据粗略测算，1988年我国工业总产值有20％以上是通过对外贸易实现的，外贸已成为十分重要的经济增长因素。
    经贸部技术进出口司赵春华处长和滕三波副处长的介绍，使周老“从大豆到卫星”的概括更为丰满和充实。他们说，自建国以来，50年代、60年代、70年代的30年间，国家技术引进总额达150亿美元，为我国在“一穷二白”的基础上建立独立的社会主义工业体系做出了贡献。80年代技术引进规模迅速扩大，方式灵活多样，引进来源多样化，先后支出205.5亿美元，引进技术近3600余项，大大缩短了我国与世界发达国家之间的差距。原来工业主体为50年代水平，现在至少已经发展到70年代的水平了。进口促进生产能力的提高以及利税增长，使国家可以拿出更多的资金投入教育科研、科技开发，继而促进出口结构优化以及创汇能力的提高，又有利于引进更多的技术和设备，这样的良性循环已经开始出现。
