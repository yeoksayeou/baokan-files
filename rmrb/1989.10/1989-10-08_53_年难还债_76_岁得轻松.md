I am 76 years old. Starting at the age of 13, I worked as a child laborer. At 23, I was laid off, and life became difficult. I borrowed 300 yuan from three poor friends to start a business. Unfortunately, the venture failed, and I lost the capital. From then on, I owed this debt.

Borrowed money must be repaid. To repay the debt, my wife and I worked as porters, sold small goods, and did whatever we could. However, those days were tough, the poorer we got, the harder it was to find a way out. We worked from year to year, struggling just to make ends meet. After five years, I hadn't earned any money, and then the Japanese invaders came. Those were tough times. I carried a basket, with a child on each side, and my wife and I fled our hometown. Wherever the Japanese occupied, we fled. We wandered for over two years. Unfortunately, my two children, one 5 years old and the other 2, died from hunger and illness on the road. In those chaotic times, even our lives were not secure, let alone repaying the debt.

After the war of resistance against Japan ended, we finally settled in Longyou City. My wife and I made a living by setting up small stalls and selling small goods. For a while, we were happy, and we had a glimmer of hope to repay the debt. But soon, the Nationalist Party's corruption led to soaring prices, and the money we earned was not enough to buy rice, let alone repay the debt.

After liberation, life gradually improved, but every time I thought of the long-overdue debt, I felt uneasy.

In 1979, the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee reached Longyou, and I was overjoyed. I observed the reforms for three years, and the more I saw, the more inspired I became. I took out 40 yuan of my retirement pension as capital and, together with my wife, set up a stall to sell fishing hooks, fishing lines, and other small fishing gear. Later, we expanded our business to include other small commodities. After five years, we calculated the money we had earned and saved. Even if we repaid the old debt at a rate of 1:5, we had more than enough. Therefore, this March, I withdrew the savings from the bank and went to Zhejiang Province's Zhujia County to find the three poor friends who had lent me money 53 years ago. Unfortunately, all three had passed away. When I handed over 1500 yuan to their sons, I couldn't help but shed tears. The recipients and those who came to see also felt deeply moved. Now, I am debt-free and have never been so happy.

### 53年难还债　76岁得轻松

    53年难还债　76岁得轻松
    我今年76岁了。从13岁开始当童工，23岁被解雇，生活无着，向3位穷朋友借了300元旧币做生意，没料到出手不利，本钱亏光，从此欠下了这笔债。
    借钱得还。为了还钱，我和孩子他娘码头搞搬运，提篮小卖，什么都干，可那年代越穷越没路走，夫妻俩年头累到年尾，连糊口也难。累了5年，我钱没挣到，又碰上逃“日本鬼子”。那可苦了。我挑副箩筐，一头一个孩子，带着孩子他娘离乡背井出了门。鬼子占一地，我们逃一程，一直逃了两年多。可怜我那两个孩子，一个5岁，一个2岁，在逃荒路上连饿带病，都夭折了。那兵荒马乱的年头，性命都难保，哪还谈得上还债。
    抗战胜利了，我们好不容易在龙游城落了户，夫妻俩靠摆小摊做小生意度日。这时，我们高兴了一阵子，心里想想，有了一丝还债的希望。但紧接着是国民党腐败，物价飞涨，我们挣的钱连买米糊口都不够，还债的事，又泡汤了。
    解放后，生活一天天好起来，可是，每当想起那笔拖欠了多年还没还的债，心里就不好受。
    1979年，党的十一届三中全会春风吹到了龙游，我可高兴了。我看改革看了3年，越看心越动。我拿出40元退休金当本钱，同老伴摆摊卖起了钓鱼钩、钓鱼线之类的小渔具。后来我们扩大生意，带卖起其他小百货。这样干了5年，算算赚来存起的钱，就是按1比5的比率还当年欠下的债，也有得多了。于是，今年3月，我从银行里取出存款，专程赶去诸暨县，去寻找53前年借钱给我的那3位穷朋友。没想到，这3位穷朋友都已去世，当我把1500元人民币分别交给他们的儿子时，我忍不住流出了老泪，接钱的和闻讯来看的人，也都感慨万千。眼下，我无债一身轻，从来没有这样快活。
