Gorbachev emphasized that at a time when society needs correct guidance, newspapers should play an active role, helping people find the right answers and pushing forward the ideas of reform, rather than confusing people's thoughts.

Gorbachev made these remarks on October 23 when he met with the editorial staff of *Pravda*. He called on journalists not to abandon their critical stance and to make uniting people for reforms in all areas their central task. He believed that the mission of the party newspaper is to make people understand the significance of the ongoing reforms.

When discussing the current economic difficulties, Gorbachev expressed his belief that as long as the scientific and creative forces of the entire society are combined, the Soviet Union will be able to normalize its financial and consumer market conditions.

He stressed that it is necessary to solve the acute problems facing the country within one to one and a half years.

He also pointed out that during the period before the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is scheduled to be held next autumn, it is necessary to reflect on what has been done in the reforms and what mistakes have been made. In the spring of next year, a program for the congress should be formulated for the entire party to discuss. He said that a society in need of reform requires a party that can effectively play the role of a political vanguard.

　　戈尔巴乔夫强调当前社会需要正确导向
　　报刊应当发挥积极作用
    新华社莫斯科10月24日电　苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说，在当前社会需要正确导向的时候，报刊应当发挥积极作用，帮助人们找到正确的答案，把改革思想推向前进，而不应把人们的思想搞乱。
    戈尔巴乔夫是23日在会见《真理报》编辑人员时讲这番话的。他呼吁新闻工作者不要放弃批判立场，要把团结人们去进行各方面的改革作为自己的中心工作。他认为，党报的任务就是让人们了解正在进行的改革的意义。
    在谈到当前的经济困难时，戈尔巴乔夫表示相信，只要将全社会的科技力量和创造力量联合起来，苏联便能使财政和消费市场状况健康化。
    他强调，必须用一年到一年半的时间来解决国家面临的尖锐问题。
    他同时指出，在明年秋天召开苏共28大之前这段时期，必须思考一下改革中做了哪些事情，有哪些失误。明年春天则应制定出代表大会的纲领供全党讨论。他说，革新的社会需要有革新的党，而这个党应能很好地发挥政治先锋队的作用。
