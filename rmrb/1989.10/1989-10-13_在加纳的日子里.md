During our days of reporting in Ghana, we encountered warm smiles and friendly people everywhere. We never felt like strangers in a foreign land. I told my Ghanaian friends, "Although your country's weather is hot, the warmth of your friendship is even more intense."

Symbol of Friendship

During our reporting, when the topic of Sino-Ghanaian friendship came up, Ghanaian friends always mentioned Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Ghana in 1964. They vividly described the moving scenes from that time. At that time, people laid out colorful cloths and scattered fragrant flowers on the asphalt roads, letting Premier Zhou's convoy pass over them, expressing their enthusiastic welcome and blessings. News media friends took out photos they had kept for many years to show us. As they looked at the photos, they said, "These are historical records, symbols of friendship. They embody the Ghanaian people's admiration for Premier Zhou and their sincere feelings for the Chinese people. We will cherish them for generations to come."

In the suburbs of the capital Accra, about 25 kilometers away, there is a botanical garden with a long history and beautiful scenery. Inside the garden, there is a centuries-old tree with lush foliage and a sturdy trunk. When Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen Yi visited Ghana, they used this ancient tree as a backdrop to take commemorative photos. Now, when we see this historically significant tree, we can't help but think deeply. The Sino-Ghanaian friendship that the leaders of the two countries have diligently cultivated is also flourishing like this tree.

During our reporting days in Ghana, the Ghanaian government gave us a high-level reception, reflecting the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. Ghana's National Provisional Defense Council member Annan emphasized the development of Sino-Ghanaian friendship when he met with us. He said, "Our friendship has withstood the test of time. Ghana highly values its friendly relations with China and hopes to strengthen this relationship." He also pointed out that third-world countries should strengthen their ties, care for each other, and solve their own problems.

Witness of Friendship

During our reporting, when discussing the friendly cooperation between the two countries, people always mentioned the Afife irrigation project. In the construction of this silver "dragon," 140 Chinese engineering and technical personnel and 500 Ghanaian engineering and technical personnel and workers participated in the battle. When the Chinese engineering and technical personnel first arrived at the site, to solve the difficulties in living, they built houses, planted vegetables, and raised pigs by themselves. Seeing this, local workers and villagers voluntarily came to help, without asking for a single penny. To cultivate management talent for Ghana, Chinese engineering and technical personnel taught technical classes while working, passing on technology to Ghanaian friends. The Chinese and Ghanaian personnel worked side by side in the dry season under the scorching sun and in the rainy season, wading through mud and rain. In nearly three years of hard work, they forged a deep friendship and achieved fruitful results, making over 800 hectares of rice fields immune to drought and waterlogging. The Afife irrigation project added new content to the friendship between the Chinese and Ghanaian peoples. An official from the Ministry of Agriculture said, "This project is a testament to our two countries' friendship. Although it has become history, the Ghanaian people will always remember it in their hearts."

Warm-hearted People

During our reporting, we were warmly received wherever we went. People were very friendly to us. At the *People's Pictorial*, we met a fellow journalist who was particularly enthusiastic and had deep feelings for China. He told us, "Our news media began mutual visits in 1964. Our former editor-in-chief visited China. He made a Zhongshan suit as a souvenir in China. Every time China celebrates its national day, he wears the Zhongshan suit to visit the Chinese embassy. He humorously said, 'I am half Chinese.' This fellow journalist yearned for China and hoped to strengthen exchanges between the news media. At the Ashanti gold mine, the public relations manager who drove us around was a smart and capable person. He was also the editor of the mine's newspaper. He was very enthusiastic, running back and forth to arrange our schedule. He also arranged for us to have meals with the workers and watch a football match. He arranged for us to stay in a villa-style guesthouse on a hill, where we could enjoy the night view of the mine area. For our underground visit, he made special safety arrangements. When we finished our visit to the mine area, he gave us a vest with 'I am a member of the company' printed on it as a souvenir. He hoped that one day he could visit China.

The most memorable person we met during our reporting was the taxi driver Tang Ke. He was neatly dressed, polite, and friendly. He told us, "I am not only a driver but also your safety officer, guide, and service staff. I will do my best to ensure your reporting success." To express our gratitude for his enthusiasm, before leaving Ghana, we gave him a Chinese shirt and a small bag with the *People's Daily* logo as a souvenir. After receiving the small gifts, he excitedly said, "Next time you come, I will drive for you again!"

Such a friendly country and such friendly people will always be unforgettable. May the flower of Sino-Ghanaian friendship bloom even more brilliantly!

### 在加纳的日子里

专栏：出访归来

    在加纳的日子里
    本报记者　申明河
    在加纳采访的日子里，我们处处可以看到热情的笑脸，遇到热心的朋友，根本没有那种“独在异乡为异客”的感觉。我对加纳朋友说：“你们的国家天气虽热，但人们对我们的情谊比天气更炽热。”
    友谊的象征
    在采访中，谈起中加友谊，加纳朋友总是首先提到1964年周恩来总理对加纳的访问。他们用生动的语言描述了当时动人的情景。当时，人们在柏油马路上铺着五颜六色的花布衫袍，洒满沁人心脾的花瓣，让周总理的车队碾过去，表示热烈欢迎和祝福。新闻界朋友把珍藏多年的照片拿出来给我们看，面对着一幅幅照片，他们说：“这是历史的纪录，友谊的象征，它体现了加纳人民对周总理的敬仰和对中国人民的真挚感情，我们要世代把它珍藏下去。”
    在首都阿克拉郊外25公里处，有一个历史悠久，风景如画的植物园。园内有一棵上百年的大树，枝叶茂盛、坚毅挺拔。周总理和陈毅副总理访加时，曾以这棵古树作背景摄影留念。如今，当我们看到这棵具有历史意义的大树时，不禁浮想联翩。由两国领导人辛勤培植起来的中加友谊，不也像大树一样正在枝叶繁茂地蓬勃发展着吗？
    我们在加纳采访的日子里，加纳政府给我们以高规格的接待，体现了两国人民的友谊。加纳全国临时保卫委员会委员安南在接见我们时强调发展中加友谊，他说：“我们的友谊经受了时间的考验。加纳十分珍惜同中国的友好关系，希望加强这种关系”。他还指出，第三世界国家要加强联系，要互相关心，自己解决问题。
    友谊的见证
    在采访中，谈到两国友好合作时，人们总是提到阿菲费灌区。在建造这条银白色的“巨龙”过程中，140名中国工程技术人员和500名加纳工程技术人员与工人参加战斗。中国工程技术人员刚到工地时，为解决生活上的困难，他们自己动手盖房、种菜、养猪。当地工人和乡亲们看到此景，就主动前来帮忙，分文不索。为给加纳培养管理技术人才，中国工程技术人员一面工作一面举办技术讲授课，向加纳朋友传授技术。中加两国人员在旱季头顶烈日，不怕酷暑，在雨季脚踩泥沼，不顾雨淋，并肩战斗在工地上。他们在近三年的辛勤劳动中，结下了深厚的友谊并结出了丰硕的成果，使800多公顷的稻田旱涝保收。阿菲费灌区工程给中加人民的友谊增添了新的内容。农业部的官员说：“这项工程是我们两国友谊的见证，它虽已成为历史，但加纳人民将永记心中。”
    热情的人民
    在采访中，我们所到之处都受到热情的接待。人们对我们十分友好。在《人民写真报》，我们遇到一位同行，他特别热情，对中国怀有深厚的感情，他对我们说：“我们两国的新闻界在1964年就开始互访，我们的前总编曾访问过中国。他在中国时做了一套中山装作纪念，每逢中国国庆，他就穿上中山装到中国使馆作客，他还风趣地说，‘我是半个中国人’”。这位同行向往中国，他希望加强新闻界的交往。在阿散蒂金矿，开车带我们参观的是一位精明能干的公关经理。他还是矿报的主编。他对我们很热情，跑前跑后，为我们安排日程，还主动安排我们和工人进餐并观看足球赛。他安排我们住在一栋建在山坡上的别墅式的招待所，夜间还可以观赏矿区夜景。为我们下井参观，他作了特别的安全安排。在我们结束矿区参观时，他把印有“我是公司一员”的背心赠我们作纪念。他希望有一天到中国来访问。
    在我们采访中，给我们印象最深刻的是出租司机唐科。他衣着整齐，彬彬有礼，待人和气。他对我们说：“我既是司机，也是你们的安全员，导游员和服务员。我尽全力使你们采访成功。”为感激他对我们的热情之心，在离加纳前，我们送给他一件中国衬衫和一个印有人民日报字样的小书包作纪念。他接过小礼物后，激动地说了一句话“你们下次来，我再给你们开车！”
    如此友好的国家，如此友好的人民，使我永远难忘。愿中加友谊之花开放的更加灿烂！
