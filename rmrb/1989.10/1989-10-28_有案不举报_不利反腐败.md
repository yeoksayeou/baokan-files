	Recently, while handling economic cases in our county, we discovered that some units have serious issues with not reporting cases or delaying reports. For instance, a temporary contract worker hired as a cashier by a certain savings institution in 1988 embezzled public funds four times within less than a year, amounting to 180,000 yuan. The county's supervising department discovered this but, considering that the worker's father is an old colleague in the same system, they hesitated to report the case due to personal connections. They only decided to stop the worker's employment and place them under investigation. Another example is a certain town's supply and marketing cooperative, which was named a "civilized unit" and an "advanced party branch" by the county's relevant departments. Since 1986, an employee of this cooperative used their position to embezzle over 200,000 yuan in public funds. The cooperative's leadership discovered this the same year but feared losing face and only stopped the employee's work and demanded the funds be returned within a set period. The leadership only reluctantly reported the case to the judicial authorities after repeatedly failing to recover the money from the employee.

	The practice of knowing about a case but not reporting it, and using personal connections instead of the law, not only affects the normal operations of judicial authorities but also, to some extent, encourages illegal and criminal behavior.

### 有案不举报  不利反腐败

　　有案不举报
　　不利反腐败
    最近，在办理我县经济案件中发现，有些单位有案不报或不及时报案的现象严重。如某储蓄所1988年录用的一个合同工出纳员，不到一年，4次挪用公款1.8万元。县主管部门发现后，考虑到其父是本系统的老同志，碍于情面，只对本人作了停止工作、听候处理的决定，不去报案。又如被县有关部门命名为“文明单位”、“先进党支部”的某镇供销社，1986年以来，一营业员利用职务之便贪占公款2万余元。当年社领导发现后怕丢“面子”，只让本人停止工作、限期退款。社领导因多次向本人追不回来钱，才不得不向司法机关报案。
    知情不举，以情代法的作法，不仅影响了司法机关正常办案，从某种意义上说也助长了违法犯罪行为。
