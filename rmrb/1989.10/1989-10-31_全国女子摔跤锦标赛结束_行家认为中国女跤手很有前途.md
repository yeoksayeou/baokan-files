The second National Women's Wrestling Championship concluded this evening in Nanjing.

In tonight's finals, which featured ten weight classes, the teams from Shandong and Inner Mongolia demonstrated their strength. Shandong's Zhao Xia, Lu Qing, Sun Shuling, and Liu Dongfeng won the titles in the 48kg, 65kg, 80kg, and 90kg weight classes respectively. Inner Mongolia's Wujina, Liu Qiaoxia, and Bu Chunying claimed the titles in the 56kg, 60kg, and 75kg weight classes. The remaining three weight classes—44kg, 52kg, and 70kg—saw Beijing Institute of Physical Education's Zhong Xiu'e, Wuhan Institute of Physical Education's Li Xuefeng, and Guizhou's Wang Xiaodong take the titles. This competition began on October 28th and included representatives from thirteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as three sports institutes.

Veteran of the Chinese wrestling scene and professor at Beijing Institute of Physical Education, Wang Deying, believes that compared to last year's first national championship, this year's event had a larger scale, and the athletes' physical condition and technical level have significantly improved. They can also employ various tactics, indicating a promising future on the world stage.

It is reported that next year, in addition to continuing the National Women's Wrestling Championship, a National Women's Wrestling Champion Cup will be established. China's top female wrestlers may participate in the second World Women's Wrestling Championship next year.

　　全国女子摔跤锦标赛结束
    行家认为中国女跤手很有前途
    本报南京十月三十日电  第二届全国女子摔跤锦标赛今晚在这里结束。
    在今晚进行的总共十个级别的决赛中，山东队和内蒙古队显示了雄厚实力，山东队的赵霞、陆青、孙淑玲、刘东风分别夺得四十八、六十五、八十和九十公斤级的冠军，内蒙古队的乌日娜、刘巧霞、卜春英分别在五十六、六十和七十五公斤级问鼎。另外三个级别：四十四、五十二和七十公斤级的冠军，分别被北京体院队的钟秀娥、武汉体院队的李雪峰、贵州队的王晓东夺走。此次比赛是从本月二十八日开始的，共有西藏等十三个省市自治区和三个体院代表队参加。
    我国跤坛元老、北京体院教授王德英认为，和去年进行的第一届全国比赛相比，本届比赛规模大，运动员的身体素质和技术水平明显提高，并且能够使用一些战术，在世界跤场上将很有发展前途。
    据悉，明年除继续举办全国女子摔跤锦标赛之外，还将设立全国女子摔跤冠军杯赛。我国女子摔跤好手可能将参加明年的第二届世界女子摔跤锦标赛。　（刘曙光）
