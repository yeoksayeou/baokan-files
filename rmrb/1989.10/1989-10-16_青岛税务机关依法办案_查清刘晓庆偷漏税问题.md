	Qingdao Tax Authorities Lawfully Investigate and Clarify Liu Xiaqing's Tax Evasion Issue

	Xinhua News Agency Qingdao, October 15th - According to information from relevant departments, the case of the famous film actress Liu Xiaqing allegedly evading 170,000 yuan in personal income adjustment tax has been thoroughly investigated by the Shandong Qingdao City Tax Bureau's Chengnan Branch. The actual situation is: Liu Xiaqing evaded 9,947.53 yuan in personal income adjustment tax from February to September 1988. On October 14th, she paid the evaded tax and fines totaling 16,854.53 yuan to the Chengnan Branch.

	According to the investigation and verification by the Chengnan Branch of the Qingdao City Tax Bureau from last December to this October, Liu Xiaqing hid 4,200 yuan of personal income during her performances in Yunnan Province in February 1988, evading 2,520 yuan in taxes. From February to September 1988, she hid 645 yuan of wage income during her performances in Yunnan, Sichuan, Hebei, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Liaoning, and Xinjiang, evading 387 yuan in taxes. The income she earned from performances in the aforementioned locations was not reported and taxed according to relevant regulations. Additionally, because the paying units deducted the personal income adjustment tax, the portion of the tax paid was not included in the total income for tax calculation, resulting in an additional 7,040.53 yuan in unpaid taxes.

	The Chengnan Tax Branch issued a "Notice of Handling Tax Violations" to Liu Xiaqing on October 4th. In addition to notifying her to pay the overdue taxes on time, they also imposed fines according to Articles 36 and 37 of the "Provisional Regulations on Tax Collection and Administration of the People's Republic of China." A fine of 2,907 yuan was imposed for tax evasion, and a fine of 4,000 yuan was imposed for refusing to declare taxes.

	While paying the taxes and fines to the Chengnan Tax Branch, Liu Xiaqing also, in accordance with relevant legal provisions, applied for a review with the Qingdao City Tax Bureau regarding the disputed issues in the Chengnan Branch's penalty notice.
