China's continued implementation of the open-door policy has been welcomed by both new and old overseas customers. In recent times, trade transactions have been active in the international market, maintaining a surplus, and the country's foreign exchange reserves have increased compared to the beginning of the year and the same period last year.

The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Liu Xiangdong, recently stated that according to the ministry's business statistics, since June, when the decline in exports was reversed, the country's foreign trade has shown a steady growth trend. The export trade volume has been increasing for three consecutive months starting from July, with a 9.4% increase in July compared to the same period last year, and further growth in August. By the end of September, the national import and export volume had reached over $57.9 billion, of which the export volume was $31.245 billion, a 4.1% increase compared to the same period last year. The import of high-end consumer goods nationwide has been somewhat controlled, and the foreign exchange balance is good.

The spokesperson said that developing foreign trade is an important part of China's open-door policy. In recent months, various levels of government have, on the one hand, focused on rectifying foreign trade order and providing more goods; on the other hand, taken practical measures to prioritize the arrangement of foreign trade procurement funds, raw materials needed for export production, and the transportation of export goods. Many provinces and municipalities have also seriously implemented the principle of balancing domestic and foreign markets, striving to arrange more goods for export. The export volume of Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Fujian, Hainan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and some coastal open cities has all seen significant growth.

Liu Xiangdong said that China's development of foreign trade benefits both China and the rest of the world, and has been welcomed by the vast majority of countries and business communities around the world. Recently, businesspeople have expressed their desire to cherish the friendly cooperative relationship that has been established and continue to develop economic and trade cooperation with China. At the same time, China has also developed some new customers and expanded its international market. He said that after 40 years of development, China's foreign trade has established a certain foundation and adaptability, and it is impossible for a few countries to isolate China.

    我国出口稳步增长
    七八九月贸易继续顺差外汇结存增加
    本报北京10月13日讯　记者陆振华报道：我国继续执行对外开放政策受到海外新老客户欢迎。最近一段时间，在国际市场上进出口成交活跃，贸易保持顺差，国家外汇结存比年初和去年同期都有增加。
    经贸部新闻发言人刘向东日前说，根据经贸部业务统计，自6月份扭转出口滑坡以来，全国对外贸易出现稳步增长趋势，出口贸易额从7月开始已连续3个月递增，7月比去年同期增长9.4％，8月出口额进一步增长。截至9月底，全国进出口额已达到579亿多美元，其中出口额为312.45亿美元，比去年同期增长4.1％。全国高档消费品进口已有所控制，外汇平衡良好。
    这位发言人说，发展对外贸易是我国开放工作的重要组成部分。近几个月来，各级政府一方面抓外贸秩序整顿，提供更多的货源；一方面采取切实可行的措施，对外贸收购资金、出口生产所需原材料、出口物资运输都尽可能优先安排；许多省市区还认真贯彻兼顾国内外市场的原则，尽力多安排一部分物资出口。东北三省、内蒙古、福建、海南、四川、云南、青海、新疆等省、区，以及一些沿海开放城市的出口额，都有较大幅度的增长。
    刘向东说，我国发展对外贸易惠及中外双方，得到世界上绝大多数国家和广大企业界的合作。近来，客商纷纷表示珍惜业已建立起来的友好合作关系，继续同我发展经贸合作；在此同时，我国也发展了一些新客户，扩大了国际市场。他说，经过40年发展的我国对外贸易，已有了一定的基础和适应能力，少数国家想孤立中国是办不到的。
