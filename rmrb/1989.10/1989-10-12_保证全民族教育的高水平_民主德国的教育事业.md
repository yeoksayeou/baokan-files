The German Democratic Republic (GDR), since its establishment in 1949 under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, has become a modern industrial nation with a highly efficient agricultural sector. The national income has been steadily increasing by 4.5% annually. This sustained growth has been largely achieved through improvements in labor productivity, which increases by 4% each year.

The success of the GDR in economic development and improving the standard of living is closely linked to its continuously developing socialist educational system. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany holds that "the education of the entire nation is directly related to the seizure and consolidation of power by the working class." Ensuring high-level education for the entire nation has been, and remains, a primary goal of the working-class revolutionary movement and a fundamental component of the party's policy. The party's program emphasizes the implementation of high-level education as a characteristic of socialism. In 1950, educational investments amounted to 1.1 billion Marks, and by 1987, this figure had risen to 13.5 billion Marks, with educational investments accounting for 5.3% of the national budget, an increase of more than tenfold since the founding of the nation.

The GDR's foundational education is solid. There are over 12,750 kindergartens nationwide, with more than 90% of eligible children receiving pre-school education. The constitution mandates that all youth must complete a ten-year compulsory education in comprehensive technical schools, with an actual enrollment rate of 95%. The ten-year schools aim to provide comprehensive education in ethics, intelligence, physical fitness, aesthetics, labor, and integrated technology. Labor education and integrated technology education are distinctive features of the GDR's foundational education, accounting for 10.2% of the total curriculum hours, with unified teaching outlines and plans.

Rational streaming is a key experience of the GDR's educational system. Upon graduating from the ten-year schools, students take a nationwide unified graduation examination. Based on their performance, moral conduct, and personal aspirations, they are streamed into different educational paths. Approximately 80% of graduates enter two-year vocational schools to become skilled workers; about 5% directly advance to specialized schools; 10% enter two-year expanded high schools (equivalent to university preparatory schools), and another 5% enter three-year vocational high schools. The GDR does not have university entrance examinations. Graduates from expanded high schools and vocational high schools, after passing a nationwide unified graduation examination, are mostly admitted to various higher education institutions (vocational high school graduates primarily enter technical colleges). The overall admission rate is around 21% of the youth of the same age.

The GDR government views vocational education as a crucial path to enhancing the quality of the workforce and labor productivity. Currently, every worker undergoes two to three years of vocational training before starting work. Vocational education is structured with 30% of the time dedicated to theoretical learning and 70% to practical training. Upon completion, students take an examination, and those who pass receive a professional worker's certificate and corresponding job placements.

The GDR's higher education system has a long-standing tradition of integrating teaching, research, and production. Higher education institutions are divided into universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools. The academic community generally believes that "the quality of university students is largely determined by the level of research in the schools. Higher education institutions must continuously develop new scientific knowledge and apply it to practice to fulfill their unique educational mission." In March 1980, the fifth national higher education conference of the GDR decided that all university students must participate in research projects. To encourage students' research initiatives, universities frequently hold student research achievement exhibitions, and the nation hosts a "Youth Scientist Science and Technology Expo" every two to three years, awarding outstanding student scientific and technological achievements. The GDR's universities strongly emphasize the integration of theory and practice, and the combination of education and productive labor. During admissions, some majors require applicants to have relevant practical knowledge or vocational training, such as technical, economic, medical, agricultural, and teacher education majors, which require students to undergo pre-enrollment internships in related enterprises. Currently, the GDR's universities have signed contracts with 150 joint enterprises, establishing fixed cooperative relationships.

The GDR places great importance on ideological education to cultivate morally and academically excellent talents. Students in ten-year schools must study civics, which introduces them to the basic principles of Marxism and Leninism, helping them understand their civic duties, rights, and the laws and social ethics they should adhere to. Higher education institutions implement comprehensive education in politics, ideology, knowledge, ability, morality, aesthetics, and physical education, with Marxism and Leninism education being the most fundamental course. To encourage students to become morally and academically excellent, schools offer various scholarships. For exceptionally outstanding students, the state provides the Karl Marx Scholarship and the Wilhelm Pieck Scholarship, with monthly stipends of up to 500 Marks and 450 Marks, respectively. To continuously improve the level of political educators, the state mandates that political educators undergo training every five years at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig, for a duration of five months, using a combination of lectures and seminars to study new achievements in Marxist theoretical research and important party documents, and to share teaching experiences. Upon completion, they must write a scientific thesis as one of the criteria for promotion and salary increase. University political educators, with the approval of the Ministry of Higher Education, can also participate in research projects at the Merlin Institute, write doctoral dissertations, and apply for doctoral degrees.

After 40 years of effort, the GDR has established a rational, interconnected, unified, and complete educational system, cultivating a large number of socialist builders. Statistics show that the GDR has 8 million workers, of whom 1.6 million are college graduates, accounting for about 20% of the workforce, and 65% are vocational school graduates. The proportion of college and vocational graduates in the workforce is higher than in some developed countries. The GDR people regard their advanced educational system as one of the most notable achievements of socialist construction.

    保证全民族教育的高水平
    ——民主德国的教育事业
    忻福良
    民主德国自1949年立国以来，在德国统一社会党的领导下，已成为一个具有高效益农业的现代化工业国，国民收入每年稳定增长4.5％。这种持续增长几乎都是通过提高劳动生产率取得的。民德劳动生产率每年提高4％。
    民德所以能在经济建设和提高人民生活方面取得成功，与不断发展的社会主义教育事业是分不开的。德国统一社会党认为：“全民族的教育直接关系到工人阶级夺取政权和巩固政权”，“保证全民族教育的高水平过去是、现在仍然是工人革命运动的主要目标，也是党的政策的牢固的组成部分”。在党的纲领中把实施高水平的教育作为社会主义的特征，1950年教育投资为11亿马克，1987年增至135亿马克，教育投资占国家总支出5.3％，比建国初期增加了10多倍。
    民主德国的基础教育很扎实。全国有幼儿园12750余所，90％以上的适龄儿童都能进入幼儿园接受学前教育。宪法规定所有青少年必须在普通综合技术学校接受十年制义务教育，实际普及率达到95％。十年制学校的教育宗旨是扎实地对青少年实施德、智、体、美、劳动和综合技术教育。其中劳动教育和综合技术教育是民主德国基础教育的一个特点，它占总课时的10.2％，有统一的教学大纲和教学计划。
    合理分流是民主德国教育的主要经验
    学生自十年制学校毕业时要参加一次全国统一的毕业会考，根据成绩、品德表现和本人志向实行分流。其中近80％的毕业生进二年制职业学校培养成为技术工人；5％左右的毕业生直接升入专科学校；10％进二年制扩大高中（相当于大学预科），还有5％进三年制职业高中。民德没有大学入学考试，扩大高中和职业高中的毕业生经过一次全国统一的毕业会考后，绝大多数均能升入各类高等学校（职业高中毕业生大多进工科院校）。总升学比例占同龄青年的21％左右。
    重视职业教育　提高劳动者素质
    民德政府将职业教育视为提高劳动者素质和劳动生产率的必由之路。目前已做到每个工人上岗之前都受过二至三年的职业培训。职业教学安排30％用于理论学习，70％用于职业实践。培训结束时要进行考试，通过者获专业工人证书和相应的就业岗位。
    民主德国高等教育素有教学与科研、生产相结合的优良传统。高等学校分为大学、独立学院和专科学校三类。高教界普遍认为：“大学生质量的高低，很大程度上取决于学校的科研水平。高等学校只有不断地发展新的科学知识，并将其应用到实践中去，才能完成其特殊的教育使命。”1980年3月，民主德国第五次全国高教会议决定，所有大学生均需参加科研项目。为了鼓励学生的科研积极性，各高校经常举办学生科研成果展览会，全国每二三年举办一次“青年科学家科技博览会”，对学生的优秀科技成果予以奖励。民德高校非常强调理论联系实际、教育与生产劳动相结合。在招生时，部分专业要求入学申请者具有相应的实际预备知识或职业实践锻炼，如技术、经济、医学、农业和师范专业，要求学生在相关企事业单位进行入学前实习。目前民主德国各大学与150个联合企业签订了合同，建立了固定的合作关系。
    重视思想教育　培养品学兼优人才
    十年制学校学生须学习公民学，这门课引导学生学习马列的初步知识，使学生知晓公民的义务、权利以及应当遵守的法律和社会公德。高等学校实施政治、思想、知识、能力、道德、美育和体育的全面教育，其中马列教育是最基本的课程。为鼓励学生成为品学兼优的人才，学校设立了各种奖学金。对特别优秀的学生，国家设立了卡尔·马克思奖学金、威廉·皮克奖学金，金额每月高达500马克和450马克。为了不断提高政治教师的水平，国家规定政治教师每五年必须在莱比锡的卡尔·马克思大学培训一次，每次五个月，采用讲授和研讨相结合的办法，学习马克思主义理论研究的新成果和党的重要文件，交流教学经验。进修结束时，必须写出一篇科学论文，作为提职提薪的依据之一。大学政治教师经高教部批准，还可参加梅林研究所的课题研究，撰写博士论文，申请博士学位。
    民德经过40年的努力，现已形成了结构合理、相互衔接的统一、完善的教育体系，造就了大批社会主义建设者。据统计，民德现有职工800万，其中160万为高校毕业生，占职工总数的20％左右，还有65％为职业学校毕业生，职工队伍中大中专毕业生比例高于一些发达国家。民德人民将他们发达的教育事业视为社会主义建设最显著的成就之一。（附图片）
