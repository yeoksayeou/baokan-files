Upon arriving in Yangshuo, the idyllic peach blossom springs and the nine-horse painted mountains all vanished into the misty mountains. It was as if one had suddenly fallen from a dreamlike, ethereal realm into the mundane world: stalls selling all manner of trinkets lined the riverbank, like stars fallen into the Li River.

Yet, I was still lost in the pursuit of the dreams carried away by the flowing water, like an old man reminiscing about his childhood play. I rushed through the crowd, as if crossing through time, hurrying towards the Moon Mountain.

I had never been to the Moon Mountain, nor did I know why it was called the Moon Mountain. Perhaps, like the Guangxi Cave in Guilin, there was a moon-shaped hole in the mountain? But I did not expect it to be a half-moon. The other half was hidden somewhere unknown, just as our past lives were lost somewhere unknown. The half-moon was indeed suspended in mid-air, high up in the lush green mountains. It made one think of Bai Juyi's poem: "Pine trees line the mountain face with a thousand layers of green, the moon shines on the waves, a single pearl." Although there was no shimmering lake here. Since we cannot board a spaceship to the moon, why not use our powerful legs to pluck this suspended mountain moon? Climb, climb, tired and sweaty, looking up, the mountain moon seemed within reach. Come on, gather your strength, climb higher! After a while, legs weakened, clothes soaked with sweat, looking up, the mountain moon was still so far away...

Hope is always so enticing, isn't it?

If you think that everything enticing is a deception, you stop your steps, or even turn back down the mountain, then you are truly deceived.

With an iron will to pluck the moon, pursue and climb, pursue and climb! Ultimately, won't you reach the rainbow-colored arch of hope?

Yes, the half-moon seen from the mountain base now looks like a rainbow arch. But this is an everlasting rainbow, beckoning hope to every unyielding moon-plucker...

The mountain moon is not the peak of the Moon Mountain. Passing through the arch, climb higher. Ahead are treacherous peaks, below are sheer cliffs, high and incomprehensible, deep and unfathomable. Is this the blue sky and yellow springs? Beyond the rainbow arch, have time and space been lost?

No, once you reach the summit, all mountains seem small. The rainbow arch of the mountain moon is nowhere to be found. Isn't this heaven beyond heaven? Looking around, unobstructed, layer upon layer of mountains, like waves, green and surging. They seem to be lined up, bowing in reverence. Is it for the mountain moon? Or is it for the brave moon-plucker?

The mountains are small, and the fields and houses below are even smaller. Clear streams follow the mountains, like a green ribbon in a maiden's hair. Beside the ribbon is a cluster of green: like jade, like moss, like mountain mist, like green feathers... Is it a hairpin flower? But where did such a large hairpin flower come from?

Let's go down the mountain to find this enchanting hairpin flower. Passing through the moon gate again, descending the steps, "the mountain moon follows the person home," following my every step.

Ah, it's not a hairpin flower! I found it: it's a giant banyan tree.

People say it is over a thousand three hundred years old. I don't know where I was then. I only see it with branches growing from the trunk, and aerial roots growing from the branches, dense shade covering, lush and verdant. It does not stand tall and proud, with dark colors reaching the sky, but is open-hearted, with a vast and clear sea. A branch stretches out far, like a single wooden bridge over dry land.

This flower of the earth, this daughter of the earth, it does not yearn for the sky, but is devoted to the earth: it embraces the earth, deeply and extensively rooted in the earth. Look: outside the trunk, several tens of meters away, there are still roots emerging from the ground. This thousand-year-old banyan tree, does it want to share its heart with the ten-thousand-year-old mountain moon, "to express its accumulated thoughts" and "to let its flowers fall and gather its fruits"?

But the mountain moon is blocked by the green mountains. Perhaps because of this, the roots are always persistently searching and searching, unwilling to lose hope? The vast fields, the flowing streams. People told me that the green ribbon is originally called the Jinbao River. Across the river, a solitary peak stands tall, with colorful stones. Between the mountain's belly, there is a cave that goes through. The reflection of the mountain moon in the "Moon-shaped Heart Pearl" of the Moon Mountain is originally here, secretly meeting with the thousand-year-old banyan tree.

Yes, the thousand-year-old banyan tree and the ten-thousand-year-old moon are both children of the motherland. They can meet anywhere. "Heaven and earth are born with me, and all things are one with me," they are the ones that time cannot erode and space cannot sever. They are immortal.

I admire the mountain moon that soars above the dust, admiring its "moonlight adds to the beauty of spring"; I also respect this banyan tree that embraces the earth, respecting its "unmoved heart even in the face of wild winds."

Thousand-year-old banyan tree, ten-thousand-year-old moon: evergreen for a thousand years, shining for ten thousand years.

　　不朽
　　徐柏容
    船到阳朔，那桃源幽境、九马画山，全都消失在山岚迷蒙中了。仿佛忽然从如梦如幻的缥渺仙境，失落在尘寰世间：卖各种杂什的小摊，栉比鳞次，密布江干，一似坠入漓江的点点繁星。
    我却还沉溺于追逐那随流水远去的梦，像老者刻骨思念儿时的嬉戏。穿过人丛就如穿越时间，急匆匆地奔向月亮山去。
    从没有去过月亮山，也不知道为什么叫月亮山。也许像桂林穿山那样，有个如满月般的透山空洞？却没想到，那不是满月，而是一个半月。另一半隐没在不知何处，就像我们的前半生也不知失落在何处一样。半月真是高悬在半空，高悬在浓荫的山翠中。令人不禁想起白居易的诗：“松排山面千重翠，月照波心一颗珠。”虽然这里没有潋滟湖光。我们不能乘太空船登月球，又何妨凭万能的双腿去摘这高悬的山月呢！攀登吧，攀登，累了，汗湿衣衫了，抬头仰望，山月似乎近在咫尺了。好，鼓鼓劲，再攀登！半天，腿软了，衣衫湿透了，再仰望，山月依然还那么远……
    希望，总是这样诱人的吧？
    倘若以为诱人的都是欺骗，你停下脚步，或者竟然返身下山，那你才真是被欺骗了。
    还是铁下摘月的心，追求、攀登，追求、攀登吧！最终不是总会登临那希望的七彩如虹的拱门么！
    是的，从山下看去的那半轮山月，如今看来却似虹彩的拱门了。只是这是永不消失的虹彩，给每个不懈的摘月者招展希望……
    山月还不是月亮山的顶峰。穿过拱门，再攀登吧。前有危峰，下有绝崖，高不可仰，深不可测。那就是碧落黄泉吗？在七彩虹门的彼端，时间、空间都失落了吗？
    不，一凌绝顶，丛山俱小。山月的虹门，也不知何在了。这岂不是天外有天？四望无碍，层峦叠嶂，如波如浪，众青倾泻，起伏奔腾。一似列队俯首礼拜。是对山月吗？抑或是对摘取山月的勇者？
    众山小了，山下的田畴房舍，更其小了。清流依山，如少女鬓际的青罗发带。发带旁还缀着一簇翠绿：如玉，如茵，如山岚，如翠羽……是簪花吗？又何来如此硕大的簪花？
    还是下山寻觅这迷人的簪花吧。再出月亮门，拾阶而降，“山月随人归”，追随着我的每一步武。
    呵，哪是什么簪花！我找到了：那是一株大榕树。
    人们说它已经有一千三百多岁了。我不知彼时我在何方。只见它树干生树枝，树枝生气根，浓荫披覆，郁郁苍苍。它并不昂首睥睨，黛色参天，却是襟怀坦白，碧海阔澄。一根横出的支干，远远伸展，犹如一座独木旱桥。
    这大地的花朵、大地的女儿呵，它不是向往于直干云霄，而只是钟情于泥土大地：它拥抱大地，深深而且广袤地植根于大地。你看：在树干外几十米处，还有根茎探出地面。这千年古榕呵，可是想和那万年山月，“摅怀归之蓄念”，“落其华而收其实”？
    可是，山月为青山遮断了。也许正因为这样，树根总在执著地探寻又探寻，不肯失去信心？平畴沃野，水流潺潺。人们告诉我，那条青罗发带，原来名叫金宝河。河对岸，孤峰危峙，石色斑斓。山腹之间，有洞透穿。“月照波心一颗珠”的月亮山山月倒影，原来在这里和千年古榕悄悄相会呵。
    是呵，千年古榕万年月，都是祖国大地的儿女，它们到处都可以相会。“天地与我并生，而万物与我为一”，它们才是时间磨不蚀、空间阻不断的，它们都是不朽的。
    我崇仰那绝尘高标的山月，崇仰它的“月色更添春色好”；我也崇敬这拥抱大地的古榕，崇敬它的“不逐狂风起浪心”。
    千年古榕万年月：千年长青，万载流辉。
