The level of Chinese men's gymnastics is rapidly improving. Li Jing won the bronze medal in the men's all-around competition at the World Gymnastics Championships.

Our reporter Jiang Jian Guo reports from Stuttgart on October 20: Last night, our 19-year-old gymnast Li Jing scored a total of 58.800 points in the men's all-around competition at the World Gymnastics Championships, securing the third place. Korobchinsky of the Soviet Union won the gold medal with 59.250 points, while his teammate Mogilny took the silver with 59.150 points.

Li Jing's scores for each event were as follows: floor exercise 9.700, pommel horse 9.850, rings 9.750, vault 9.800, parallel bars 9.800, and horizontal bar 9.900. He performed exceptionally well on the pommel horse, vault, horizontal bar, and parallel bars, executing some moves that are currently unprecedented and landing very stably.

Another Chinese participant, Li Ge, scored a total of 58.500 points, placing eighth, while Li Chunyang scored 57.100 points, ranking 23rd. Originally scheduled to compete in the all-around, Ma Zheng changed to participate in the individual event finals.

Li Jing is from Changsha, Hunan, and his coach is Huang Yubin. He previously won the gold medal for the horizontal bar and the silver medal for the vault at the Washington U.S. Open this year.

After the competition, Zhang Jian, the head of the Chinese gymnastics delegation, said that Li Jing's performance indicates that China has regained its historical best level in this event. In the 1983 Budapest Games, Lou Yun also won the third place in the all-around competition. Today, the West German newspaper "Stuttgart Daily" commented that Li Jing has the potential to reach the top, and if the judges had given him higher scores, he could have done so.

　　中国男子体操水平迅速回升
　　李敬获世界体操锦标赛个人全能铜牌
    本报斯图加特10月20日电  记者江建国报道：我国19岁的李敬昨天晚上在世界体操锦标赛的男子个人全能比赛中，以58.800分的总成绩荣获第3名。苏联的科罗普钦斯基以59.250分获得冠军称号，他的队友莫吉尔尼以59.150分获得亚军。
    李敬昨天各单项成绩分别是：自由体操9.700分，鞍马9.850分，吊环9.750分，跳马9.800分，双杠9.800分，单杠9.900分。他的鞍马、跳马、单杠和双杠发挥十分出色，完成了一些当前还没有人做的动作，而且落地很稳。
    参加个人全能比赛的中国选手李舸以58.500分的总成绩名列第8，李春阳以57.100分获第23名。原定参加全能比赛的麻征改参加单项决赛。
    李敬是湖南长沙人，教练是黄玉斌。他曾在今年的华盛顿美国杯比赛中获得单杠金牌和跳马银牌。
    中国体操代表团团长张健在赛后说，李敬的成绩表明中国在这一项目比赛中已经恢复到历史最好水平。1983年布达佩斯大赛上，楼云也曾获得个人全能的第3名。西德的《斯图加特日报》今天说，李敬完全能够登上顶峰，如果裁判的评分再高一点的话。
