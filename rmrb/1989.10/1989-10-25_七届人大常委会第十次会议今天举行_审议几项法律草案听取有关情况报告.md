The tenth session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee is being held today. The session will review several draft laws and hear reports on related matters.

New China News Agency, Beijing, October 24th - (Reporter Zhang Sutan) The spokesperson for the National People's Congress Standing Committee Office, Zhang Hugeng, announced today that according to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the tenth session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee will be held in Beijing on October 25th, with a duration of approximately one week.

It is understood that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress proposes that the main agenda items for this session include: reviewing the draft Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law, the draft Urban Residents' Committee Organization Law, the draft amendment to the Environmental Protection Law, and the draft Urban Planning Law; hearing reports from the Supreme People's Court on the implementation of the "Two Courts' Notice," the Supreme People's Procuratorate on the anti-corruption and bribery efforts of the procuratorial organs, and the Ministry of Supervision on the anti-corruption efforts; reviewing the reports from the six special committees of the National People's Congress on the results of the review of the bills submitted by the deputies for the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress; hearing reports from the delegation of the National People's Congress on their visits abroad and handling appointments and removals.

At the press conference, Zhang Hugeng also answered questions from domestic and foreign journalists. When asked by a Japanese journalist whether this session of the Standing Committee will discuss the personnel arrangements of China's top leaders, Zhang Hugeng said, "This meeting will handle some appointments and removals, but there is no agenda item regarding the appointment and removal of the top leaders."

During the eighth session of the Seventh Standing Committee, the Standing Committee decided to establish an investigation team to investigate the matter of Hu Jiyue, a member of the Standing Committee, entrusting the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute to collect signatures from members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, requesting an emergency session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Our reporter inquired about the progress of the investigation. Zhang Hugeng said that this matter is still under investigation, and the results of the investigation will be reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Hu Jiyue is currently still performing his duties as a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

A Hong Kong journalist asked about the recent activities of certain Hong Kong members of the Basic Law Drafting Committee. Zhang Hugeng said that it is understood that the Hong Kong members of the Drafting Committee, Si Tuohua and Li Zhumin, have done many things since June this year that are "extremely inconsistent" with their status as members of the Drafting Committee. As to whether they will continue to work in the Basic Law Drafting Committee, it still needs to be decided by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

　　七届人大常委会第十次会议今天举行
　　审议几项法律草案听取有关情况报告
    新华社北京10月24日电  （记者张宿堂）全国人大常委会办公厅新闻发言人张虎生今天在这里宣布：根据全国人大常委会委员长会议的决定，第七届全国人大常委会第十次会议将于10月25日在北京举行，会期大约一周。
    据了解，委员长会议建议本次常委会会议的议程主要有：审议集会游行示威法草案、城市居民委员会组织法草案、环境保护法修改草案、城市规划法草案；听取最高人民法院关于《两高通告》贯彻执行情况的报告，最高人民检察院关于检察机关开展反贪污、贿赂斗争情况的报告，监察部开展反腐败斗争情况的报告；审议全国人大六个专门委员会关于第七届全国人大二次会议主席团交付审议的代表提出的议案审议结果的报告；听取全国人大代表团出访报告和通过任免事项等。
    新闻发布会上，张虎生还回答了中外记者的提问。在回答日本记者关于本次常委会议是否讨论中国高层领导人人事安排的问题时，张虎生说，这次会议将通过一些任免事项，“但没有关于最高领导人的人事任免的议程”。
    七届八次常委会期间，委员长会议曾决定成立调查小组，就胡绩伟委员委托四通社会发展研究所征集全国人大常委会委员签名，要求召开全国人大常委会紧急会议一事进行调查。本社记者就此寻问调查进展情况。张虎生说，此事目前仍在调查之中，调查结果将向全国人大常委会委员长会议报告。胡绩伟委员目前仍在履行他的全国人大常委会委员的职责。
    一名香港记者问及香港基本法起草委员会某些香港委员近来的活动。张虎生说，据了解，草委会香港委员司徒华、李柱铭自今年6月以来，做了许多与起草委员会委员身份“极不相符”的事情。至于他们是否留在基本法起草委员会工作，还需要全国人大常委会审议决定。
