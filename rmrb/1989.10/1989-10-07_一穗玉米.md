    An Ear of Corn
    Zhou Shaohua

    When corn tassels in the sultry heat,
    My heart feels like the crops swaying in the wind.
    Approaching each stalk of corn gives me a sense of power,
    Inspiring me.
    The sun rises in the east and sets in the west over this cornfield,
    This is the longest day of the year for me.
    Shouldering my hoe, I walk gracefully along the ridges,
    Listening to the intermittent songs of the crickets,
    Watching the land grow more bountiful.
    An ear of purple corn silk
    Interrupts my thoughts so charmingly.
    The wind rustles it, sometimes near, sometimes far.
    That ear of corn stands solemnly by my side, ripening.
    These kernels of corn are what I have been longing for,
    Day and night.
    From the dense corn leaves hanging down,
    I breathe in the last of the sky.
    My restless heart finds peace.
    A chilly breeze blows over the hill,
    Carrying a coolness that creeps into my collar.
    From afar, the scattered village looks
    Most radiant with its stacks of cornstalks and the eaves
    Under which hang ears of golden corn.
    At this moment,
    I always recall the excitement of walking through the fields
    And the corn singing softly in the granary.

    一穗玉米
    邹少华
    玉米扬花的时候天气闷热
    我的心情像这一坡风中的庄稼
    走近每一棵玉米就有一种力量
    鼓舞着我
    这样日头在这块玉米地
    东头冒出来西头落下去
    这是我一年四季最漫长的一天
    肩扛着锄头优雅地走在田垄上
    聆听蟋蟀断断续续小曲
    看着渐渐丰满起来的土地
    一穗紫色的玉米缨子
    迷人地打断了我的思路
    有风而刷刷地忽远忽近
    那穗玉米在我身畔庄严成熟
    这一把一把玉米粒是我盼望的
    日日夜夜
    自茂密的玉米叶子垂下来开始
    我呼吸着最后的天空
    不安的心情恢复宁静
    有瑟瑟的风从岭那边翻上来
    带着凉意钻进脖领子中
    远看这稀稀啦啦的村庄
    最耀眼的是那一垛又一垛
    玉米秸和屋檐下
    那一穗穗黄橙橙的玉米
    这个时候
    我总是想着走过田野时的兴奋
    和那在仓中吟唱小曲的玉米
