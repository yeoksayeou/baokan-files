Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Severe environmental pollution has resulted in over 100,000 children dying each year, 1 million infants having elevated lead levels in their blood, 1.5 million people suffering from chronic asthma, and 7 to 8 out of every 10 people experiencing respiratory disorders. This has caused immeasurable harm to the health of the city's 18 million residents and has affected the harmonious development of the economy and society.

In the past 30 years, Mexico City has lost 65% of its forest area, with each person having less than 1 square meter of green space. The situation is equally dire nationwide. As a result, the United Nations Environment Programme has listed Mexico as one of the countries facing the most severe ecological challenges.

The severe pollution and ecological degradation in recent decades are primarily due to the 130,000 factories in the Federal District and the Mexico City region, of which 50,000 are highly polluting. There are 22 factories that pose fatal risks, such as the Mexico Blast Furnace, the Tolteca Cement Plant, the Federal Electricity Commission, the Mexican Petroleum Company, and the Mexican Fertilizer Company. The smoke and toxic gases released by these factories, combined with the pollutants from the 3 million vehicles operating in Mexico City, form a major source of pollution. Additionally, the thousands of tons of garbage produced daily, along with the existing garbage that has not been cleared, contribute to the spread of harmful substances and the proliferation of pests. The most urgent pollution issue is water. Due to the daily discharge of large amounts of industrial wastewater and the unrestricted use of harmful chemicals like pesticides in agricultural areas, 95% of rivers and reservoirs are polluted to varying degrees. This pollution has also affected the oceans, which have become repositories for large amounts of harmful and radioactive substances. Recently, the Mexican Navy conducted a public cleanup of the coastal areas, revealing that the lead content in the coastal waters is 10 times higher than it was 40 years ago.

To effectively reduce pollution in Mexico City, the government is implementing a series of measures. On March 1, the government issued and began implementing an ecological law, which experts consider to be positive.

On June 5, World Environment Day, Mexico announced 12 technical measures and other nationwide plans to reduce pollution. The technical measures include: not approving any new or expanded factory projects in the Mexico City region; conducting inspections on all motor vehicles in the area and removing those that do not meet the technical committee's standards; producing unleaded gasoline and low-sulfur diesel; installing anti-pollution catalysts in new cars; signing agreements with factories to install emission control devices; monitoring production activities such as cement factories and setting standards for sulfuric acid use; regulating the discharge of wastewater from 8 industrial units and establishing standards for hazardous waste.

Francisco Rojas, the general manager of the Mexican Petroleum Company, also announced a series of measures to reduce pollution from the company's facilities in Mexico City, particularly the "March 18th Refinery." Rojas is also preparing to implement plans to produce low-pollution gasoline and diesel.

Vehicle inspections in Mexico City began in August, with the first batch of approximately 750,000 vehicles being inspected. The vehicle inspection work will continue for 9 months. According to investigations, vehicles account for 70% of hydrocarbon pollution and 62% of nitrogen oxide pollution, making them a significant factor in Mexico City's pollution.

Additionally, Mexico has begun cleaning up important ports such as Manzanillo, Acapulco, Progreso, Carmen City, Veracruz, and Tampico.

With the implementation of the anti-pollution plan, the Mexican government hopes to reduce hydrocarbon pollution by 65%, carbon monoxide by 70%, and nitrogen oxides significantly over the next three years.

　　墨西哥城的污染与反污染
　　周小妹
    墨西哥的首都——墨西哥城是世界上污染最严重的城市之一。严重的环境污染不仅致使该城每年有10万多儿童死亡，100万幼儿血液中铅的含量增高，150多万人患有慢性气喘病，10个人中有7至8人患有呼吸系统紊乱症，对该城1800万居民的身体健康产生了无可估量的损害，而且影响了经济社会的协调发展。
    最近30年中，墨西哥城已丧失了65％的森林面积，人均占有绿地面积不足1平方米。就全国范围来说，情况也非常严重。为此，联合国环境规划署把墨西哥列为面临生态领域最严重挑战的国家之一。
    墨西哥的污染严重并造成最近几十年里生态严重破坏的原因是，在墨西哥联邦区及首都地区有13万家工厂，其中5万家危害性较大，而且有22家工厂可引起致命后果，如墨西哥高炉厂、托尔特卡水泥厂、联邦电力委员会、墨西哥石油公司、墨西哥肥料公司等等。这些工厂释放的烟雾和有毒气体加之在墨西哥城行驶的300万辆汽车排放的毒气，形成了一大污染源。其次是每天产生的成千上万吨垃圾，加上来不及被清理而堆积在露天的固有的垃圾，造成大量有害物体大肆扩散并且使虫害肆意繁衍。第三，引起污染的最急迫问题是水。由于全国天天排放的大量工业废水和农业地区不加节制地大量使用杀虫剂等有害化学物质，造成95％的河流和水库受到不同程度的污染。同时也污染了海洋，海洋已成为大量有害物质和放射性物质的储存处。最近，墨西哥海军对沿海进行了一次公开的清理工作，据透露，墨海岸中溶解铅的含量是40年前的10倍。
    为了有效地减少对墨西哥城的污染，政府正在采取一系列措施。今年3月1日政府颁发并开始实施一项生态法，该法被有关专家们认为是积极的。
    6月5日在世界环境日之际，墨西哥又宣布采取12项技术性措施和其它在全国各地减少污染的计划。技术性措施主要包括：不再批准在墨西哥首都地区开办或扩大任何工厂的计划；要对所有在该地区运行的机动车辆进行检查并且取消那些不按照技术委员会规定的要求行驶的车辆；生产无铅汽油和硫磺含量低的柴油；在新生产的汽车内加入防污染的催化剂；同工厂签订安装控制排放量的装置；监督如水泥工厂之类的生产活动，对其硫酸的使用规定指标；对8个工业单位的废水排放作了规定，并制定了属于危险废物类别的标准。
    墨西哥石油公司总经理费朗西斯科·罗哈斯也宣布了一系列减少该公司在墨西哥城的设施造成污染的措施，尤其是减少“3月18日炼油厂”的污染。罗哈斯还准备实施生产低污染汽油和柴油的计划。
    墨西哥城的车辆检查工作已从8月份开始，第一批受检车辆约75万辆，车辆检查工作将进行9个月。据调查，车辆的污染占碳氢化合物污染的70％，占氮的氧化物污染的62％，它们是造成墨西哥城污染的重要因素。
    另外，墨西哥已着手对一些重要的港口，如曼萨尼略、阿卡普尔科、普罗格雷索、卡门城、韦腊克鲁斯及坦皮科港等进行清理。
    随着反污染计划的实施，墨西哥政府希望在今后3年里，将碳氢化合物污染减少65％，将碳的一氧化物减少70％，氮的氧化物也将大量减少。
