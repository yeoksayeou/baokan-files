    Inner Mongolia's livestock industry has achieved another bumper harvest. Approximately 150,000 tons of high-quality, affordable beef and mutton will be supplied to markets outside the region this winter.

    Our reporter, Ào Tēng, learned from relevant departments in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that the region will supply about 150,000 tons of high-quality, affordable beef and mutton to markets outside the region this winter.

    Based on continuous years of good harvests, Inner Mongolia's livestock industry has achieved an extraordinary bumper harvest this year. By the end of June, the total number of livestock in the region reached 47.5 million head, setting a new historical high. It is estimated that this year's slaughtered cattle and sheep will be around 10 million head, with a total meat production of 200,000 tons. After accounting for local sales and consumption by herdsmen, there will still be 150,000 tons available for markets outside the region.

    The four major grasslands of Xilingol, Ulanqab, Urad, and Ordos are the main production areas for beef and mutton in Inner Mongolia. Due to the high quality of the grass, the beef and mutton produced here are known for their delicious taste and have always been popular both within and outside the region. This year, due to the abundant supply, the average purchase price for net meat per kilogram at the production sites is around 4.4 yuan.

    The autonomous regional government recently decided to fully open the beef and mutton market in the region, allowing users from within and outside the region to directly purchase from the production areas. All unreasonable fees in the purchase and sale of beef and mutton will be abolished, and transportation will only require a dispatch ticket and a quarantine certificate, with no obstacles along the way.

    内蒙古畜牧业又获丰收
    15万吨牛羊肉今冬可供区外市场
    本报呼和浩特10月10日电　记者傲腾从内蒙古自治区有关部门获悉：该区今冬约有15万吨优质、廉价牛羊肉投放区外市场。
    内蒙古畜牧业在连年丰收的基础上，今年又获得特大丰收。6月末，全区牲畜存栏达4750万头（只），创历史最高水平。据此预测，今年出栏牛羊在1000万头（只）左右，产肉可达20万吨。除区内销售和牧民自食外，仍有15万吨可供区外市场。
    锡林郭勒、乌兰察布、乌拉特、鄂尔多斯四大草原，是内蒙古牛羊肉主产区。由于草质好，所产牛羊肉味道鲜美，历来受到区内外青睐。今年因货源充足，目前产地平均每公斤净肉收购价为4.4元左右。
    自治区政府日前决定，全区牛羊肉市场全部开放，允许区内外用户直接到产区采购，取消牛羊肉购销中的一切不合理收费，调运只凭调出发货票和检疫证，不得沿途阻截。
