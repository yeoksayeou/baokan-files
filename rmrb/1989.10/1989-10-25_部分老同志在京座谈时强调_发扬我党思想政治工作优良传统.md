Veteran comrades emphasized the need to carry forward the Party's fine traditions in ideological and political work during a symposium held in Beijing.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 24th - (Reporter Zhang Chao Wen) At today's symposium on inheriting and developing the traditions of ideological and political work, the veteran comrades present believed that ideological and political work remains the lifeline of all the Party's work, and that the Party's fine traditions in this area must be carried forward.

Since last winter, the magazine "Ideological and Political Work Studies" has conducted a discussion on "How to Understand the Traditions of Ideological and Political Work." In the articles sent from all over the country to participate in the discussion, various opinions were expressed on what constitutes the traditions of the Party's ideological and political work and how these traditions should be inherited and carried forward. The editorial department of this magazine specially invited some veteran comrades to hold a symposium today.

Kang Shiren, a member of the Central Advisory Commission and former State Councilor, said that we should raise our awareness, unify our thinking, and strengthen ideological and political work in large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. We must not only recognize its importance but also have a sense of urgency. This is because international hostile forces are attempting to bring about a "peaceful evolution" in socialist countries. In building socialism with Chinese characteristics, large and medium-sized enterprises under full public ownership are important strongholds of socialism. We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, take large and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone, and build a highly politically conscious and particularly combat-ready industrial army capable of resisting "peaceful evolution."

Zeng Zhi, a member of the Central Advisory Commission, said that to carry forward the Party's fine traditions, we must first have a Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought standpoint and perspective. Secondly, our ideological and political work must be practical and reach the grassroots level. We must rely on the masses. At the same time, we must remember that our ideological and political work is about working on people's minds, not just talking and lecturing, but caring for, cherishing, and helping people.

Duan Junyi, a member of the Central Advisory Commission, and Gao Yang, Guo Hongtao, Liu Jie, Feng Jixin, and Liu Shi, members of the Central Advisory Commission, as well as Liu Shi, vice chairman of the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work Research Association, also spoke at the symposium, emphasizing the need to strengthen ideological and political work, build a strong team of ideological and political workers, and educate the people with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Yuan Baohua, a member of the Central Advisory Commission and chairman of the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work Research Association, said in his concluding remarks that the speeches of the veteran comrades were a summary of the ongoing discussion on "How to Understand the Traditions of Ideological and Political Work." We believe that the Party's ideological and political work must be strengthened, and the principle of one central task and two basic points must be adhered to. The leading role of the Party organization in enterprises must be affirmed, and we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class. When implementing the factory director responsibility system, all cadres must focus on both economic work and ideological and political work. Yuan Baohua proposed that all Communist Party members in enterprises must never forget their role and mission. We must, on the basis of carrying forward the Party's fine traditions in ideological and political work, dare to innovate and continuously improve.

　　部分老同志在京座谈时强调
　　发扬我党思想政治工作优良传统
    新华社北京10月24日电　（记者张超文）在今天召开的思想政治工作继承传统、发展传统座谈会上，与会老同志认为，思想政治工作依然是我们党各项工作的生命线，党的思想政治工作优良传统必须继续发扬。
    去冬以来，《思想政治工作研究》杂志开展了一次“怎样认识思想政治工作传统”的讨论，在全国各地寄来参加讨论的稿件中，就什么是我们党思想政治工作的传统，应该如何继承和发扬这些传统，提出了各自的意见。这家杂志编辑部今天特邀请部分老同志举行了座谈会。
    中顾委常委、原国务委员康世恩说，我们应该提高认识、统一思想、加强在大中型国营企业中的思想政治工作。我们不仅要认识到它的重要性，而且要有紧迫感。因为国际上的敌对势力试图对社会主义国家进行
  “和平演变”。我们建设有中国特色的社会主义，全民所有制大中型企业就是社会主义的重要阵地。我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级，以大中型企业为骨干，建立起一支能抵御“和平演变”的、有高度政治觉悟的、特别能战斗的产业大军。
    中顾委委员曾志说，继承党的优良传统，首先要有一个马列主义、毛泽东思想的立场、观点。其次是我们的思想政治工作要接触实际，做到基层，要依靠群众。同时，要记住我们的思想政治工作是做人的思想工作，不能就是谈谈话、讲讲道理，而是要关心人、爱护人、帮助人。
    中顾委常委段君毅，中顾委委员高扬、郭洪涛、刘杰、冯纪新和中国职工思想政治工作研究会副会长刘实也先后在座谈会上发言，提出思想政治工作必须加强，要建立一支过硬的思想政治工作队伍，用马列主义、毛泽东思想教育人民。
    中顾委委员、中国职工思想政治工作研究会会长袁宝华在最后发言中说，老同志们的发言，是对这次“怎样认识思想政治工作传统”大讨论的总结。我们认为党的思想政治工作必须加强，一个中心、两个基本点必须坚持；企业的党组织在企业中的核心作用必须确定，必须全心全意依靠工人阶级，在实行厂长负责制时，所有干部必须经济、思想政治工作两手抓。袁宝华提出，企业中的所有共产党员，时刻不能忘记党员的作用和使命。我们要在继承党的思想政治工作优良传统的基础上，大胆创新、步步提高。
