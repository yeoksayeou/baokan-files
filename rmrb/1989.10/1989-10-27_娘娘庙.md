The Temple of the Queen Mother is located on the high plateau of Dabantian, at the junction of Chengkou, Kaixian, and Xuanhan counties in Sichuan Province. It faces south and is constructed with bricks and wood.

The Temple of the Queen Mother is divided into several parts: the Hall of the Jade Emperor, the Hall of Guanyin, and the Temple of Guan Yu. It is always bustling with visitors, and incense burns continuously throughout the year.

Upon entering the temple, one can see eight massive wooden pillars, each as thick as a person's embrace, deeply embedded in hexagonal carved stone bases. The roof beams are sturdy and solid, with four corners rising high. The double beams and double brackets, along with the upturned eaves and arched ridges, showcase the exquisite craftsmanship of ancient laborers. In the main hall, a majestic and dignified Queen Mother sits enthroned, cradling a full-moon-shaped prince. The solo sculpture is lifelike, as if it could respond to a call; the group sculptures have varied expressions, vivid and lifelike.

Inside the temple, there is also a statue of the Sea Conch Immortal. The statue is crowned with golden rays and surrounded by auspicious clouds. Behind it, a chaotic scene of soldiers is depicted, with countless figures and thunderous roars. Just as the situation reaches a critical point, a sudden thunderclap and a storm of rain, hail, and snow engulf the chaotic army camp, causing a scene of utter chaos. Lightning strikes, fire burns, and rain lashes out, leaving the soldiers either dead or fleeing in disarray.

According to legend, during the Western Han Dynasty, there was turmoil within the imperial court. The pregnant empress was escorted to this place by an unnamed general. Unfortunately, the news leaked, and the rebel army pursued and surrounded them. In the fierce battle, the general was killed, and the few remaining guards were no match for the enemy. Just as the situation seemed hopeless, the Sea Conch Immortal descended to save them, summoning winds and rains, and calling forth thunder and lightning to subdue the rebels. The local people, based on this legend, built the Temple of the Queen Mother and sculpted the statues of the Queen Mother and the Sea Conch Immortal.

    娘娘庙位于四川省城口、开县、宣汉交界的大山坪上，座北朝南，砖木结构。
    娘娘庙分作玉皇楼、观音殿、关帝庙几个部分。游人如云，四季香火不断。
    进得庙内，可见八根合抱的木质圆柱深嵌在六角形的雕花石墩上，房脊抬梁坚固如磐、四棱上线；双檩双挂，飞檐拱脊，显示出古代劳动人民的精巧手艺。庙中正殿上，端坐一位雍容华贵的皇娘娘，怀抱满月太子。独雕形象逼真，呼之欲应；群雕神态各异，栩栩如生。
    庙内还有一座海螺仙座像，头顶金光万道，祥云霭霭。背后的乱兵群象，人多势众，吼声震天。正值千钧一发之际，晴空突起霹雳，狂风暴雨裹来冰雹雪弹在乱军营里狂轰滥炸。雷劈火燎、雨鞭抽打，乱军死的死、逃的逃，一片混乱景象。
    相传西汉年间，朝廷内乱。身怀有孕的皇后娘娘由一位不知姓名的将军护逃至此。不幸消息走漏，乱军追来，被包围得水泄不通。激战中，将军被杀，护兵寡不敌众。正在危难之际，海螺大仙下凡解救，呼风唤雨，招来雷电，降伏乱兵……当地人民根据传说，修建了这座娘娘庙，塑了娘娘、海螺仙座像。
