There are no rolling hills, no winding coastlines, no dense forests, no vast grasslands… Yet, the entrance gate just a few steps wide in front of the building I guard is called the "second border line."

The dense shade, the quiet path, and the beautiful, distinctive villas hidden among the green trees; the tall flagpole flying a foreign flag… This is the embassy district of foreign missions in the capital.

Five years ago, at the age of 18, I bid farewell to my parents and entered the green military camp, becoming a sentinel on the "second border line." Every time I stand on this 4-square-meter post, I think, I am Chinese, I am the Chinese person that foreign diplomats see almost every day—I must bring honor to China! Thus, a strong sense of pride and a sacred sense of responsibility well up in my heart. Whether it is the scorching summer sun or the biting winter winds, how many days and nights have I stood tall and straight, my vigilant gaze never wavering.

Here, every movement is closely tied to the honor and dignity of our motherland. You might think standing guard is an easy task, but in reality, to maintain a dignified and proper appearance, soldiers undergo countless hours of rigorous physical training. Those who can't keep their chests out don't use pillows when they sleep; those who can't keep their legs together tie their legs with a rope even when lying in bed; those who can't keep their shoulders level draw a horizontal line on the wall and practice standing against it for three or four hours at a time. Besides standing practice, we also train hard in combat skills. Only through such training do we develop the ability to stand unmoved by wind, cold, heat, or insects, and a set of solid skills.

On a summer noon, the sun melts the asphalt. To maintain a proper appearance, we still wear thick woolen ceremonial uniforms. One day, fully armed and unmoving, I stood on a post without any shade. A diplomat secretly observed me from the embassy building. If I stepped to the left, there would be shade; if I stepped back, there would be an electric fan and a recliner inside the guardhouse. But despite the sweat dripping down, I didn't move an inch. The diplomat, watching me, finally couldn't help but come down and stand in front of me, praising me for my dedication to duty.

In our hearts, national prestige is a blazing fire, a sacred fire. We will never forget that our beloved Premier Zhou, in the midst of his busy schedule, came to visit the soldiers. He held the soldiers' hands and said, "Young comrade, don't underestimate your post. If you can handle matters at the embassy gate well, you are bringing honor to our motherland!" The embassy district appears calm on the surface, but beneath the calm, there is also unrest, requiring sentinels to remain calm and fearless in the face of danger. My comrade Li Denggui is the one who, in a life-or-death struggle, stopped a counter-revolutionary who rushed into the embassy with a smoking grenade, ensuring the safety of the embassy, but ultimately sacrificed his own life. The diplomats who witnessed this heart-stopping scene excitedly gave a thumbs up and said, "Chinese police—great!"

Who says standing guard is boring! It is in this monotonous, ordinary work that we bring honor to our motherland. Of course, we are also young people with blood, flesh, emotions, and love. We also have our own pursuits, but what is more sacred and important than the mission to protect the interests and dignity of our motherland?

For this mission, some comrades gave up the opportunity to go to university for further studies, some gave up the chance to go abroad to inherit family property, and some couldn't even return to see their loved ones on their deathbeds… A 19-year-old comrade, suffering from intestinal cancer, insisted on going on duty. In his final moments, he still said on his deathbed, "I really want to see my post again, to stand guard a few more times…"

This special post and sacred mission test the soldiers and also cultivate heroes. Under the influence of a heart full of patriotism, in recent years, in addition to my duties and training, I often squeeze out a bit of rest time to contribute articles to the party newspaper, reflecting the soldiers' spirit of dedication and expressing our love for the motherland. I have published more than 300 articles in dozens of newspapers and magazines.

I know that as I grow older, one day I will leave the "second border line," but the love for my post is an unquenchable fire that will continue to burn. Because it is here that I embarked on the path of dedicating myself to the people's cause; it is here that the patriotism of a people's soldier has been purified and elevated.

### 站在“第二国境线”上

    站在“第二国境线”上
    首都武警部队　薛兆强
    没有绵绵山峦，没有弯弯海岸，没有密密丛林，没有茫茫草原……然而，我守卫的楼前这个几步宽的临街大门，却被称为“第二国境线”。
    蔽日的浓荫，静谧的小道，还有那绿树掩映中一幢幢漂亮别致的小楼；高高的旗杆上，飘着异国的旗帜……这里是首都的外国驻华使馆区。
    5年前，18岁的我告别父母，迈进了绿色警营，成为一名“第二国境线”上的警士。每当我站上这4平方米的哨位，我就想到，我是中国人，是外国使节进进出出几乎天天见到的中国人——我要给中国人争光！于是，强烈的自豪感和神圣的责任感，从我心里油然升起。不管是夏日骄阳似火，还是冬夜朔风凛冽，有多少个日日夜夜，我挺胸昂首，笔直笔直地站立，警惕的目光一刻不懈。
    在这里，一举手一投足都与祖国的荣誉与尊严息息相关。你也许以为站岗是件容易事，其实，为了具备端庄的警姿警容，战士们不知经过多少艰苦的形体训练。胸脯挺不起来的，睡觉从不枕枕头；双腿并不拢的，躺在被窝里还要用背包绳把腿捆上；双肩不平的，便在墙上画一道水平线，贴墙练站，一练就是三四个小时。除了练站，还要苦练杀敌本领。就这样练，才练就“风吹不闭眼，天冷不跺脚，天热不擦汗，虫叮不乱动”的站功和一套过硬的本领。
    盛夏的中午，太阳把柏油路面都晒软了。为了保持良好的警姿警容，我们仍然穿着厚厚的呢制礼宾服。有一天，我全副武装、一动不动地站在没有遮荫的哨位上。一位外交官偷偷地在使馆楼上观察我。我向左跨一步，就有荫凉；后退一步，哨楼内就有电扇、躺椅。可是任凭汗流浃背，我半步都没有挪动。那位外交官看着看着，终于忍不住走下楼，来到我面前，夸我忠于职守。
    在我们心中，国威是一团热烈的火，一团神圣的火。我们忘不了，敬爱的周总理生前曾在百忙之中来看望战士，他拉着战士的手说：“小同志，可不要小看你们的哨位呀，你们能处理好使馆门前的事情，就是为我们祖国争光！”使馆区表面看一派平静，但在平静中也潜伏着不平静，需要警士们遇事不慌、临危不惧。我的战友李登贵，就是同身背嗤嗤冒烟的手榴弹闯使馆的反革命分子殊死搏斗、最后保住使馆安全，自己却壮烈献身的。目睹这惊心动魄一幕的外交官，激动地伸出大拇指说：“中国警官——伟大！”
    谁说站岗放哨乏味！就在单调、平凡的工作中，我们为祖国赢来了荣誉。当然，我们也是有血有肉有情有爱的青年人，也有个人的追求，但有什么比卫护祖国利益与尊严的使命更神圣更重要的呢？
    为了这个使命，有的战友放弃了上大学深造，有的放弃了到国外继承亲属财产，有的在亲人临终时都没能回去见上一面……一位才19岁的战友，患了肠癌还坚持要求去上哨。生命弥留之际，还在病床上断断续续地说：“真想再看一眼我的哨位，再站上几班岗……”
    特殊的岗位，神圣的使命，考验着战士，也培育着英雄。在一颗颗爱国心的感染下，近几年来，我在执勤训练之余，常常忍不住挤出点滴的休息时间，为党报投稿，反映战士们勇于奉献的精神，抒发我们对祖国的爱，先后在几十种报刊上发表文章300余篇。
    我知道，随着年龄的增加，总有一天我会离开“第二国境线”，但是，对岗位的爱，是不熄的火，它会一直不停地燃烧下去。因为，正是在这里，我踏上了献身人民事业的人生道路；正是在这里，一个人民战士的爱国之情，得到了纯净和升华。
