    The Paris-based Chinese-language newspaper *Europe Times* published an editorial today, exposing and refuting Yan Jiaqi and Wu'erkaixi, who, under the guise of "democracy" and "freedom," have been engaging in activities against the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government after fleeing to France.

    The editorial, titled "Two Different Starting Points," points out:

    After the Beijing incident, many so-called "democracy activists" fled abroad one after another. They waved the banner of "democracy" and "freedom," relying on certain forces for support, openly calling for a "grand alliance" with the Kuomintang in Taiwan and the Dalai Lama group to engage in activities against the current Chinese government. Their true colors have been increasingly exposed to overseas Chinese. Today, apart from the conservative faction of the Kuomintang providing full support and financial backing, and shouting for them, who among the Chinese with a conscience would still patronize them?

    This time, the farce of Yan Jiaqi and Wu'erkaixi holding a so-called "democracy alliance" founding ceremony in Paris has been met with coldness and contempt from the French-Chinese community. This is the best proof that actions without a popular base will have no future.

    Yan Jiaqi and his ilk are now waving a sign in front of the world, claiming to be representatives of the millions of students and citizens in the Beijing incident, using this to deceive those who do not know the truth. This is a complete distortion of the facts.

    During the Beijing incident, indeed, tens of thousands of Beijing students and people from various strata took to the streets to protest. Most of them were dissatisfied with the social ills of recent years, but they were not aiming to overthrow the Communist Party of China and the current Chinese government.

    However, Yan Jiaqi and Wu'erkaixi thought the time to overthrow the Communist Party of China and the current Chinese government had come. They used rumors to incite trouble, amassing personal wealth. When their plot failed, they once again threw themselves into the arms of the Kuomintang, accepting money from the Kuomintang, and together, they formed a "grand alliance."

    We can clearly see that the starting points of the mainland's broad masses and Yan Jiaqi and his ilk are completely different. The broad overseas Chinese community's concern for China stems from their love for China, their deep pain over the various social ills on the mainland, and their hope that China will become strong and join the ranks of advanced nations.

    Yan Jiaqi and Wu'erkaixi openly or secretly take money from the Kuomintang to do dirty work. They have completely degenerated into the Kuomintang's running dogs, eating the leftovers from the Kuomintang!

    《欧洲时报》撰文批驳严家其之流
    新华社巴黎9月29日电  巴黎出版的中文报纸《欧洲时报》今天发表评论员文章，揭露和批驳流亡到法国的严家其、吾尔开希等打着所谓“民主”、“自由”的幌子进行反对中国共产党和中国政府的活动。
    这篇题为《两种不同的出发点》的评论指出：
    北京事件后，不少所谓的“民运斗士”陆续逃亡到国外，他们打着“民主”、“自由”的旗号，靠着某种势力的豢养，公开喊出了要与台湾国民党和达赖集团“大联合”的口号，从事反对中国现政府的勾当。他们的真面目已越来越被海外广大华侨、华人看清了。时至今日，除了台湾国民党保守派倾力支持和输钱输血、并为之卖力呐喊外，有良知的中国人，谁还肯去光顾他们？
    这次严家其、吾尔开希之流在巴黎演出所谓“民阵”成立大会的闹剧，法华社会对他们的冷淡和唾弃，就是最好的说明，没有群众基础的行动，是不会有什么前途的。
    严家其等人现在在世人面前晃起一块招牌，似乎他们是“北京事件”中百万学生、市民的代表，以此来迷惑不明真相的人们。这完全是对事实的歪曲。
    北京事件中，当时确有几十万北京学生和各阶层人士走上街头游行，他们中的绝大多数是出于几年来对社会不正之风的不满，但是他们绝不是要推翻中国共产党和中国现政府。
    但严家其、吾尔开希之流却以为推翻中国共产党和中国现政府的时机已到，利用谣言进行煽风点火，大捞私人资本，当阴谋失败后，又一次扑进台湾国民党的怀抱，接受国民党给予的金钱，拥抱在一块搞起“大联合”。
    我们可以清楚地看出，大陆广大民众和严家其之流的出发点是完全不同的。广大海外华侨、华人对中国的关心，是出于对中国的爱，对于大陆的种种不正之风痛心疾首，恨铁不成钢，其出发点也是希望中国富强，走进先进国家行列。
    严家其、吾尔开希之流公开地或暗地里拿着国民党的金钱，干着肮脏的事情，他们已正正式式地完全堕落成国民党的走狗，吃着国民党的剩饭！
