In a residential area of Tokyo's Meguro Ward, there lives an elderly woman named Mitsuo Michino. She is renowned not only for her longevity in Japan but also for being the oldest private English tutor in the Japanese archipelago.

Since the early 20th century, Ms. Mitsuo has been teaching English as a private tutor, with over 70 years of teaching experience. Although Ms. Mitsuo now has six children, 13 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren, and celebrated her 100th birthday on July 7 this year, her enthusiasm for teaching English remains undiminished. She continues to teach English to elementary and middle school students every week.

Many of the students who have been taught by Ms. Mitsuo have gone on to attend prestigious institutions such as Tokyo University and specialized foreign language schools.

    百岁英语教师
    在日本东京都目黑区一所住宅内，居住着一位名叫三浦信乃的老人。她不仅以长寿闻名日本，更以年龄最大的任课家庭教师而名扬日本列岛。
    三浦老人自20世纪初开始担任英语家庭教师以来，至今已有70余年教历。虽然，三浦老人现在有6位儿女，13位孙儿女、18位曾孙儿女，并于今年7月7日度过了百岁诞辰，但是，她教授英语的热情却不减当年，每周仍坚持为中、小学生上英语课。
    经过三浦老人教过的学生，有的考进东京大学，有的考入外语专科学校。
