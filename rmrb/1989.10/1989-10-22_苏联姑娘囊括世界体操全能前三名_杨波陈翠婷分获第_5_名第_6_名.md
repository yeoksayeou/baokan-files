Our athletes Yang Bo and Chen Cuiting last night in the women's all-around competition at the World Gymnastics Championships scored 39.687 and 39.662 respectively, securing the 5th and 6th places in this event. This is the best result achieved by our athletes since Ma Yanhong won the 4th place in 1981.

The powerful and emerging Soviet team swept the top three spots in this event. Boginskaya, with flawless and beautiful movements, won the championship. She scored two 10s in the vault and floor exercise, and 9.950 in the balance beam and uneven bars. Lashchenko took the silver medal, scoring two 10s in the vault and uneven bars, 9.987 in the floor exercise, and 9.875 in the balance beam. Strayeva came in third with a score of 39.774.

Romania's Bontas placed 4th with a score of 39.762. She also scored a 10 in the floor exercise.

Our athlete Fan Di fell off the balance beam midway through her routine, affecting her overall score, and ended up in 17th place.

Yang Bo's scores were: vault 9.962, uneven bars 9.875, balance beam 9.900, and floor exercise 9.950. Chen Cuiting's scores were: vault 9.950, uneven bars 9.875, balance beam 9.900, and floor exercise 9.937.

Romania's former world champion, Silivas, who was highly favored to win, also fell off the balance beam midway through her routine and had an unstable landing at the end, placing her in 12th in the all-around.
