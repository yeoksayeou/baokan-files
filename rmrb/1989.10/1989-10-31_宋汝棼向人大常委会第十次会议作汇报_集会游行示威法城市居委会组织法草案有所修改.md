He said, the draft stipulates that for illegal assemblies, parades, or demonstrations that refuse to obey the dispersal order, "the on-site police in charge have the right to decide to take necessary measures to forcibly disperse, and to forcibly remove or immediately detain those who refuse to comply. When the police take measures to forcibly disperse, they can use weapons or tools in accordance with relevant state regulations." Based on some committee members' opinions, it is suggested to modify "the on-site police in charge have the right to decide to take necessary measures to forcibly disperse" to "the on-site police in charge have the right to decide to take necessary measures to forcibly disperse in accordance with relevant state regulations." It is also suggested to delete "When the police take measures to forcibly disperse, they can use weapons or tools in accordance with relevant state regulations."

Song Ruwei said, the draft stipulates: "During the assembly, parade, or demonstration, if public or private property is damaged or personal injury is caused, civil liability shall also be borne in accordance with the law." Based on some committee members' opinions, it is suggested to modify it to: "During the assembly, parade, or demonstration, if public or private property is damaged or personal injury is caused, in addition to being punished in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Criminal Law or the Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security, civil liability shall also be borne in accordance with the law."

Regarding the draft of the Urban Residents' Committee Organization Law, Song Ruwei said, the draft's fourth article stipulates: "The residents' committee shall carry out community service activities that are convenient and beneficial to the people. The residents' committee can establish production and living service industries that are convenient and beneficial to the people, and manage the property owned by the residents' committee. No department or unit shall infringe upon the property rights of the residents' committee." Based on some committee members' opinions, it is suggested to modify it to: "The residents' committee shall carry out community service activities that are convenient and beneficial to the people, and can establish relevant production and living service industries. The residents' committee manages the property of the residents' committee, and no department or unit shall infringe upon the property rights of the residents' committee."
