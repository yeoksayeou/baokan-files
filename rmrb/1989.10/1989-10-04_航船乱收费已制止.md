After your newspaper published the letter from a reader on April 22nd on the sixth page titled "Excessive Charges on Jianghan River Shipping," we immediately coordinated with the captain and the party branch secretary of the Jianghan 61 shipping line to investigate this issue.

To strengthen the implementation of regulations, we have ordered the individuals involved and the team leader to write a written self-criticism. We have also deducted the monthly bonuses of the individuals involved and the monthly labor bonuses of the entire team.

    航船乱收费已制止
    你报四月二十二日第六版刊登《江汉航班船寄件乱收费》的读者来信后，我们立即会同江汉六一航班轮船船长和党支部书记查清了这一问题。
    为强化规章制度的落实，我们已责成当事人和班长写出书面检查，扣发了当事人的月度奖和全工班月度的劳务奖。
