The autumn-winter sowing campaign in China's rural areas has fully begun from north to south. The reporter recently learned from the Agricultural Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture that this year's preliminary autumn-winter sowing area is 6.6 billion mu, an increase of over 350 million mu compared to last year; among these, the grain crop area is 4.5 billion mu, an increase of 1390 million mu compared to last year.

Currently, the main wheat-producing areas in the north have entered the peak wheat-sowing period, and the oilseed rape seedling cultivation in the south has come to an end. According to statistics on various regions, this year's oilseed rape area can reach over 790 million mu, an increase of 500 million mu compared to last year; winter green manure covers 720 million mu, an increase of 1300 million mu compared to last year; winter vegetable sowing also maintains a good development trend.

From the feedback of various regions, the favorable factors for this year's autumn-winter sowing are mainly: first, various levels of leadership attach great importance to it, starting early and acting quickly. The summer grain and oil high-yield competition and standard-achieving activities organized by the Ministry of Agriculture this year have played an active role in promoting the autumn-winter sowing. Whether it is the regions that have achieved a bumper harvest and won awards this year, or the regions that have suffered heavy disasters and have not achieved the standard, they have basically completed the sowing preparations and strive to achieve new heights next year. Second, material preparations are better than in previous years. According to reports from Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, the main winter wheat-producing regions, the current fertilizer inventory has increased by over 20% compared to the same period last year. The total fertilizer supply for autumn sowing, except for the tight supply and partial imbalance of phosphorus fertilizer, can basically meet the needs of autumn sowing. This year, the accumulation of farmyard manure and the amount of straw returned to the field in most regions have also significantly increased. For example, Henan Province has prepared 2.34 billion cubic meters of farmyard manure, with an average of 3.2 cubic meters per mu, an increase of 0.2 cubic meters compared to last year. Third, technical training and propaganda work are well-organized, and various forms of group contracting and yield-increasing measures have been implemented more solidly.

Relevant officials from the Ministry of Agriculture also pointed out that there are some difficulties that cannot be ignored in this year's autumn-winter sowing. Due to the delayed maturity period of autumn crops, the start of this year's autumn sowing has been correspondingly delayed, which is not conducive to the tillering during the seedling period and overwintering; this year, the main wheat-producing regions of Hebei and Shandong have experienced less rain during the summer and autumn, and the task of drought-resistant sowing remains significant; many provinces and regions have also reported that the shortage of seed dressing drugs will affect the disease resistance of overwintering crops.

### 秋冬种全面展开  粮食作物面积增加一千多万亩

    秋冬种全面展开
    粮食作物面积增加一千多万亩
    新华社北京10月12日电（记者蒲立业）我国农村秋冬种工作已从北到南全面展开。记者近日从农业部农业司获悉，今年全国秋冬种初步落实面积6.6亿亩，比去年扩大3500多万亩；其中粮食作物面积4.5亿亩，比去年增加1390万亩。
    目前，北方夏粮主产区已进入麦播高峰；南方油菜育苗已告尾声。据对各地情况的统计，今年秋冬种油菜籽面积可达7900多万亩，比去年增加500万亩；冬绿肥7200多万亩，比去年扩大1300万亩；冬种蔬菜也保持了良好的发展势头。
    从各地反映的情况看，今年秋冬种的有利因素主要是，一、各级领导重视，发动早、行动快。今年农业部组织开展的夏季粮油高产竞赛达标活动，对搞好秋冬种起了积极推动作用。不论是今年喜获丰收、达标受奖地区，还是受灾较重、未能达标地区，都已基本上做好了备播工作，力争明年再上新台阶。二、物质准备比往年好。据鲁、豫、皖、苏、陕、晋等冬麦主产区反映，目前，化肥库存比去年同期增加20％多，秋种总肥源除磷肥紧张和局部不平衡外，可基本满足秋种需要。今年多数地区农家肥的积造和秸秆还田数量也明显增加，如河南省已备农家肥2.34亿方，亩均3.2方，比去年增加0.2方。三、技术培训、宣传工作抓得紧，多种形式的集团承包及增产措施，都落实得比较扎实。
    农业部有关人士同时指出，今年秋冬种也存在一些不容忽视的困难。由于秋作物成熟期推迟，使今年的秋播起始期相应推迟，这对苗期分蘖和越冬都不利；今年河北、山东等小麦主产区伏、秋雨少，抗旱播种任务仍然很大；不少省区还反映，拌种农药不足，将影响越冬作物的抗病能力。
