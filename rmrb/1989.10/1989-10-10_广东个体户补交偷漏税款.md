Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 9th - (Reporter Zhang Zhaoxiang) According to statistics from the Guangdong Provincial Taxation Bureau, since the tax inspection of individual households began on August 1 this year, by September 20, the total amount of taxes and fines paid by individual households in the province reached 47.55 million yuan.

Guangdong currently has over 500,000 individual industrial and commercial households. After the State Taxation Bureau issued the "Notice on Rectifying the Tax Order of Urban and Rural Individual Industrial and Commercial Households," various levels of taxation departments in Guangdong immediately mobilized individual households to conduct self-inspections and self-reports. During the self-inspection phase, many individual household owners actively checked for tax evasion.

    广东个体户补交偷漏税款
    据新华社广州10月9日电　（记者张朝祥）据广东省税务局统计，从今年8月1日开始对个体户税收进行大检查以来，到9月20日，全省个体户补交的税款及罚款达4755万元。
    广东现有个体工商业户50多万户。国家税务局发出《关于整顿城乡个体工商业户税收秩序的通告》后，广东各级税务部门立即发动个体户进行自查自报，在自查阶段，不少个体户主动检查偷漏税的情况。
