Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 5th.

According to a broadcast by the Democratic Kampuchea radio station today, Khieu Samphan, the Vice President and Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea side, issued a statement on October 2, reaffirming the policy and stance of the Democratic Kampuchea.

Khieu Samphan stated that the Democratic Kampuchea side will continue to implement the National Unity Program issued in December 1979 to promote the great unity of all ethnic groups in Cambodia. The Democratic Kampuchea side firmly supports the five-point peace plan proposed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, to achieve national reconciliation and establish a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk, with the task of organizing elections under the supervision of the United Nations. The Democratic Kampuchea side once again calls for the dispatch of a United Nations supervisory body to Cambodia to monitor and verify the final withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and illegal immigrants from Cambodia. After the complete withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops, the Democratic Kampuchea side proposes to disarm all parties in Cambodia and reduce each party's military to 10,000 personnel equally. The Democratic Kampuchea side respects the results of the elections under United Nations supervision and actively participates in the establishment of a democratic and free parliamentary system.

Khieu Samphan said that the Democratic Kampuchea side calls for international guarantees for the future independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity of Cambodia. The Democratic Kampuchea side will consolidate and develop cooperative relations with all countries in the world on the basis of peace and mutual benefit.

Malaysian Deputy Foreign Minister Ghafar Baba today, in his speech at the UN General Assembly, called on the United Nations to take effective measures to supervise and verify the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.

Ghafar Baba said that Vietnam's unilateral announcement of "complete withdrawal" is difficult to believe unless it accepts effective supervision and verification by an international organization. He said that only the United Nations can provide the necessary personnel, authority, and funds to send such an organization to Cambodia.

Singapore's Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam today, in his speech at the UN General Assembly, expressed doubt about Vietnam's unilateral announcement of "complete withdrawal" and demanded that the United Nations supervise Hanoi's claimed "withdrawal."

In addition to Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand also expressed doubts about Vietnam's unilateral claim of "withdrawal" in their speeches at the UN General Assembly last week.
