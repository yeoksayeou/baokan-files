Recently, archaeologists from Ningxia discovered thousands of primitive decorative items in a late Neolithic tomb in Qiying Township, Guyuan County.

These bone and stone beads have diameters ranging from 3.5 to 4 millimeters and thicknesses from 1 to 3 millimeters. Each bead has a 1 to 1.5 millimeter round hole in the center. Strung together, they would make exquisite jewelry even by modern standards.

The craftsmanship of these bone and stone beads has left archaeologists bewildered. Each tiny bead is cut so evenly, polished so smoothly, and the holes are so uniformly drilled. What tools did the primitives use? Especially the small hole in the center, which is even thinner than a ballpoint pen tip, could not have been drilled without specialized tools. To string a 50-centimeter-long necklace, about 1,600 beads would be needed. In this tomb cluster, bone and stone beads are widely distributed, indicating that their owners were not isolated individuals. Who manufactured so many bone and stone beads?

The mystery of the primitive bone and stone beads awaits explanation from experts and scholars.

    固原考古有新的发现
    原始人骨珠石珠之谜待解
    据新华社银川10月10日电　（记者王漫沧）最近，宁夏考古工作者在固原县七营乡一座新石器晚期的墓葬里，挖掘出数千枚原始人的装饰品。
    这些骨珠、石珠直径在3.5—4毫米之间，厚度为1—3毫米，中间有1—1.5毫米的圆孔，用线穿起来，在现代也不失为精美的工艺品。
    这些骨珠、石珠的加工工艺使考古工作者困惑莫解。那粒粒小珠切割得如此整齐，打磨得那么光滑，穿孔十分匀称，原始人用的是什么工具呢？特别是中间那个比圆珠笔芯还细一点的小孔，没有专用工具无论如何钻不出来。要用这些骨珠、石珠穿一条50厘米长的项链，大约需要1600余枚。在这处墓群中，骨珠、石珠广泛分布，说明当时拥有者并非个别人。这么多的骨珠、石珠又由谁来制造？
    原始人的骨珠、石珠之谜，期待着专家、学者们的解释。
