The song and dance performance "Children of the Black Soil" is majestic and soaring, with graceful and unique movements. The powerful and unrestrained singing, combined with the vigorous and unrestrained dancing, along with the jingling of waist bells, the beating of eight-sided drums, and the waving of handkerchiefs, all create a strong and dynamic atmosphere on the stage in the capital. The performance by the Shenyang Military Region Forward Song and Dance Troupe, structured in a "block" format, is titled "Sun, Red Star, Children of the Black Soil." It is divided into four parts: "Golden October," "Green Symphony," "White Mountain Spring Tide," and "Children of the Black Soil," with the most moving part being "Children of the Black Soil."

The vast black soil, the rolling and howling winds, and the snowstorms all nurture countless wonders and raise countless children of the Northeast. "Children of the Black Soil" consists of the dance "Crossing the Pass," the solo song "A Small Village on the Black Soil," the male solo "Walking Along the Liao River," and the song and dance "Soul of the Black Soil."

In the somber and tragic dance music, the lead dancer delicately portrays the image of a Northeast mother. The male and female group dances, under the red and yellow lights, evoke the vast fields of red sorghum and yellow soybeans. The dance vocabulary, rich in Northern characteristics, emphasizes the "pioneering" spirit, showcasing the indomitable spirit of the Northeast children in their efforts to open up this wild land.

The solo song "A Small Village on the Black Soil" has lyrics that are simple and full of life, like a fragrant red rhododendron. "Walking along the Liao River, one can never leave the broad chest of the Northeast people," which displays the open and honest hearts and spirits of the children of the black soil.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the director boldly used more than ten children, aged six or seven, as dancers, achieving a strong artistic effect. When the children joyfully run onto the stage and dance innocently to the beautiful music, the limited stage presents an endless expanse of time and space. The past, present, and future of the black soil all come to mind, making it both an ancient land and a youthful land.

"The soil that grows sorghum and soybeans also nurtures strong daughters, bold sons, and rugged men." In the song "Soul of the Black Soil," the lead dancer, dressed in Northern ethnic clothing, and the group dancers, dressed in costumes symbolizing the White Mountains and Black Rivers, dance freely, blending traditional and modern dance techniques.

At the end, a large white cloth covers the entire stage. Suddenly, a peak rises, like the majestic and sacred White Mountains standing on the stage, expressing the rising spirit of the children of the black soil. (Accompanied by a photograph)

    雄浑昂扬　风姿奇巧
    ——歌舞“黑土儿女”赏析
    晓超
      “站起是兴安岭，躺下是松花江”。雄浑昂扬的歌声，粗犷奔放的舞姿，腰铃、八角鼓、手帕，撞击着，敲打着，旋舞着，在首都舞台上留下一股强劲的东北风。来自北国的沈阳军区前进歌舞团以“板块式”为结构的一台歌舞晚会，题为“太阳·红星·黑土儿女”，共分“金色十月”、“绿色交响”、“白山春潮”、“黑土儿女”四部分，其中最感人的是“黑土儿女”。
    一马平川的黑土地，翻卷呼啸的大风雪，生长着多少神奇，养育了多少关东儿女。“黑土儿女”由舞蹈《闯关东》、女声独唱《黑土地上的小村庄》、男声独唱《沿着辽河走》、歌舞《黑土之魂》组成。
    在苍凉悲壮的舞曲中，领舞细腻动人地塑造着关东母亲的形象，男、女群舞在红、黄两束灯光映照下，使人想起那漫山遍野的高粱红，大豆黄。富有北方特点的舞蹈语汇，着意刻画“闯”的性格，展示了关东儿女在开拓这片蛮荒土地中不屈不挠的气概。
    独唱《黑土地上的小村庄》歌词质朴，生活气息浓烈，像一朵馨香的红杜鹃。“沿着辽河走，总也走不出关东人的宽胸口”，展示了黑土地儿女坦荡如砥的胸怀和气魄。
    尤其值的一提的是，编导大胆地用了十多个六、七岁的娃娃伴舞，取得了强烈的艺术效果。当孩子们欢叫着奔向舞台，在优美的歌声中天真起舞时，有限的舞台展现了无限的时空，黑土地的昨天、今天、明天，引人思索，这既是古老的土地，也是青春的土地。
      “生长大豆高粱的土壤，也生长坚强，女儿泼辣，男儿粗犷。”“即使把头颅抛在地上，青丝也染黑这片土壤。”在《黑土之魂》歌声中，身着北方民族服装的领舞与身着象征白山黑水服装的群舞演员纵情起舞，民族舞与现代舞手法相映。
    结尾时，一幅巨大的白布覆盖了整个舞台，猛然间奇峰突起，像巍峨圣洁的白山耸立于舞台之上，表达了黑土儿女奋发崛起的风姿。（附图片）
