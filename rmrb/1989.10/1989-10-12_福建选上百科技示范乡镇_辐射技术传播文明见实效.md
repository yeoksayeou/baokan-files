104 science and technology demonstration townships are shining like stars across the land of Fujian. Their demonstration and radiation effects have proven that the path of relying on science and technology to promote modernization in Fujian's rural areas is practical and effective.

The construction of science and technology demonstration townships in Fujian Province was proposed in 1987, and after selecting sites, training, and planning, it began to be implemented last year. According to statistics, 104 demonstration townships have established 779 technical schools or training classes, held 2,390 training sessions last year, and trained over 180,000 farmers in technical skills. This has laid a foundation for the promotion of scientific and technological achievements. A considerable number of townships have achieved economic growth rates of 40% to 50% through science and technology; the total industrial and agricultural output value of the 104 townships last year was 5.61 billion yuan, an increase of 34.4% over 1987, 12 percentage points higher than the provincial average growth rate; 16 townships have become billion-yuan townships, of which 6 have become double-billion-yuan townships; 75 townships have increased per capita income by more than 100 yuan.

The construction of science and technology demonstration townships has promoted the deepening of rural science and technology system reforms. The establishment of deputy township and village heads for science and technology, deputy heads, and assistants, as well as science and technology committees, associations, and agricultural, livestock, and forestry science and technology service stations, and the emergence of science and technology demonstration households and specialized households, have formed a science and technology network that adapts to rural reforms.

The demonstration and radiation effects of science and technology demonstration townships are increasingly evident in Fujian's rural areas. The lean meat rate of Anxi Du Huai hybrid pigs is 54%, and the promotion of 100,000 heads across the county has increased income by 4 million yuan. The ceramic science and technology achievements and the "technology, labor, and trade" integration in Dihua Xinzhu Township have opened up a new path for the local ceramic industry. Their demonstration effects are also reflected in the construction of spiritual civilization.

    福建选上百科技示范乡镇  辐射技术传播文明见实效
    本报福州10月11日电　记者张铭清报道：104个科技示范乡镇像星火在八闽大地闪耀。它们的示范和辐射作用，证明福建农村依靠科技促进现代化建设的路子切实可行。
    福建省科技示范乡镇的建设，是1987年提出，并进行选点、培训、规划后，于去年开始实施的。据统计，104个示范乡镇建立了779个技术学校或培训班，去年办培训班2390期，培训农民技术员18万余人次。这就为推广科技成果打下了基础。相当部分乡镇依靠科技取得经济增长的比例达到40％至50％；104个乡镇去年工农业总产值达56.1亿元，比1987年增长34.4％，高于全省平均增长速度12个百分点；有16个乡镇成为亿元乡镇，其中6个成为双亿元乡镇；75个乡镇人均增加收入100元以上。
    科技示范乡镇的建设，推动了农村科技体制改革的深入。科技副乡镇长、副村长、助理员的配备，科委、科协和农、畜、林等科技服务站的建立，科技示范户、专业户的涌现，形成了与农村改革相适应的科技网络。
    科技示范乡镇的示范和辐射作用，正在福建农村日益体现。瘦肉率为54％的安溪杜槐杂交猪，在全县推广10万头，增收400万元。德化浔中乡的陶瓷科技成果和“技工贸”一条龙，为当地陶瓷业的发展闯出了一条新路。它们的示范作用，还体现在精神文明建设上。
