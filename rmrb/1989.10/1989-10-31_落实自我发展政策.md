Currently, the hidden dangers and various inadequacies in highway construction reflect the lameness and deformity of China's comprehensive transportation system. To solve the long-term constraint on national economic development posed by the transportation issue of "goods not flowing smoothly and people not traveling conveniently," it is necessary to formulate and implement a series of industry policies and technical policies that are conducive to highway development. The key issues that need to be further clarified and the policies that urgently need to be "tilted" towards include:

    (1) Utilizing the "commodity" attribute of highways, borrowing (raising funds) to build roads, and allowing toll collection after loan repayment to continue, so that the construction of high-grade highways and large-scale highway bridges and tunnels can achieve self-"rolling" development. Perfecting and implementing this policy is beneficial to the country and the people, and it allows the highway industry to get out of the "dead end" of state investment "without a destination." "Build" and "collect," "collect" and then "build," year after year, "rolling" development, and there is no need to worry about the development of China's highways.

    (2) Taking the province with the highest road maintenance fee collection standard as the limit, allowing low provinces to "align" with high ones, and implementing a nationwide unified standard. This approach can, on the one hand, increase revenue to make up for the shortage of road maintenance and construction funds; on the other hand, it can reduce or avoid disputes caused by different road maintenance fee collection rates and amounts in various places.

    (3) Appropriately adjusting the road maintenance fee collection standard for tractors participating in operations, so that the construction and maintenance of county and township roads have a stable source of funds. Currently, the "preferential treatment" for tractors paying road maintenance fees is too much, with some tonnage fees only equivalent to 1/4 of the car road maintenance fees. This is clearly unreasonable. If the tractor road maintenance fee collection standard can be adjusted to be consistent with or close to that of cars, it will be very beneficial for the stable increase in the funds for the extensive county and township roads.

    (4) Adjusting the "laborers build roads" policy. It is possible to treat the villages, industrial and mining enterprises, and individuals within a 15-kilometer range along the highway equally, with each vehicle and person contributing 2-3 vehicle days or labor days per year, or collecting a substitute fee (i.e., "money in lieu of labor").

　　落实自我发展政策
　　交通部工程管理司高级工程师　夏越超
    目前，公路建设中的隐患和种种不适应，反映了我国综合运输体系的跛足和畸形。为解决“货不畅其流，人不便于行”，这一长期制约国民经济发展的交通问题，必须制定并切实执行一系列有利于公路发展的产业政策和技术政策。当前，需要进一步明确的问题和急待“倾斜”的政策主要有：
    （一）利用公路的“商品”属性，贷款（集资）修路，并允许收费还贷后继续收费，使高等级公路和大型公路桥梁、隧道的建设得以自我“滚动”发展。完善并实施这一政策，利国利民，并使公路事业能从国家投资
  “无着落”的死胡同里走出来，“建”了“收”，“收”了再“建”，年复一年，“滚动”发展，不愁我国公路不发展。
    （二）以目前养路费征收标准最高的省份为限，允许低的省份向高的“看齐”，实行全国统一标准。这样做，一来可以增加收入，弥补公路养护与修建资金的不足；二来可以减少或避免因各地养路费征收费率费额高低不一带来的纠纷。
      （三）适当调整参加运营的拖拉机的养路费征收标准，使县乡公路的修建、养护有一个稳定的财源。目前对拖拉机缴纳养路费“优惠”过多，有的一个吨位取费只相当于汽车养路费的1／4。这是明显不合理的。如能把拖拉机养路费征收标准调整到与汽车一致或相近，这对于稳定地增加量大面广的县乡公路的财源是十分有利的。
      （四）变通“民工建勤”政策。可对公路沿线15公里范围内的农村、工矿企事业单位和个人一视同仁，每车每人每年尽两三个车日、工日的义务，也可收代金（即“以金代劳”）。
