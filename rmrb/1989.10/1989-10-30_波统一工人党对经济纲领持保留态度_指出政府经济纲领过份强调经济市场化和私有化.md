The Polish United Workers' Party supports the measures taken by the government led by Solidarity to improve the current severe economic situation, but at the same time points out that the government's economic program overly emphasizes economic marketization and privatization, and in some aspects deviates from the Round Table Agreement.

The Social-Economic Policy Commission of the Polish United Workers' Party's Central Committee discussed the current economic situation in Poland and the new government's economic program on October 27 and adopted a formal document outlining the party's stance on evaluating the domestic economic situation and the government's economic program.

The document, which was published in full by the "People's Tribune" on October 28, states that the current economic situation in Poland is very severe. Due to the decline in production, scarcity of market goods, and difficult living conditions for the people, the economy has entered a period of "hyperinflation." The document states that the United Workers' Party supports the major measures taken by the new government, including tightening monetary policy and controlling inflation, but believes that the government's economic program has not identified the main causes of the decline in production and has ignored the consequences of shortages of raw materials and energy. In addition, the government's program overly emphasizes ownership and economic system reform, that is, vigorously promoting economic privatization and developing a market economy, blurring the distinction between a socialist economy and a capitalist economy.

The document states that the United Workers' Party opposes the notion that private economy is the "best form of ownership" and also disagrees with the exaggerated role of market mechanisms.

The document also points out some statements in the government's economic program that deviate from the Round Table Agreement, expressing that the party will continue to fulfill the Round Table Agreement and hopes that the government led by Solidarity will also keep its commitments.

　　波统一工人党对经济纲领持保留态度
　　指出政府经济纲领过份强调经济市场化和私有化
    新华社华沙10月28日电　波兰统一工人党支持团结工会领导的政府在争取改善当前严峻的经济形势方面采取的一些措施，但同时指出政府的经济纲领过份强调了经济市场化和私有化，在某些方面背离了圆桌会议协议。
    波兰统一工人党中央社会—经济政策委员会27日讨论了当前波兰国内经济形势和新政府的经济纲领，并通过了该委员会关于在评价国内经济形势和政府经济纲领问题上的立场的正式文件。
    《人民论坛报》28日全文刊登的这项文件指出，当前波兰经济形势十分严峻，由于生产下降，市场商品匮乏，人民生活艰难，经济生活“进入了超通货膨胀时期”。文件说，统一工人党对新政府当前采取的一些包括紧缩银根、治理通货膨胀的重大措施“表示支持”，但认为，政府的经济纲领没有找出造成生产下降的主要原因，忽视了原材料和能源不足的后果。此外，政府纲领过份强调所有制和经济体制改革，即大力推行经济私有化和发展市场经济，抹杀了社会主义经济同资本主义经济的区别。
    文件说，统一工人党反对把私有经济说成是“最好的所有制形式”，也不同意夸大市场机制的作用。
    文件还指出了政府经济纲领中背离圆桌会议协议的某些提法，表示波党将继续履行圆桌会议协议并期望团结工会领导的政府也将恪守承诺。
