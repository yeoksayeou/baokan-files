The Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yu Hongliang, held a banquet on the evening of October 6 at the embassy to warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union.

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Ryzhkov, and other leaders from the Soviet government, the Central Committee of the CPSU, the armed forces, and the Soviet Friendship Society attended the banquet.

On October 1, 1949, after the founding of the People's Republic of China was proclaimed, the Soviet Union recognized it on October 2 and was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

At the banquet, Yu Hongliang said, "The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union has had an important impact on the stability of peace in Asia and the world. After the normalization of relations between the two countries, the two countries have been developing smoothly along the path of friendly cooperation according to the principles set forth in the high-level meetings. The ambassador pointed out that the two sides have traditional cooperation experience and a good willingness to expand cooperation. The prospect of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in various fields is broad."

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev said, "The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and China has greatly promoted the traditional friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. He said that the Soviet people unreservedly support the normalization of Soviet-Chinese relations and the restoration of contact between the two parties. At present, the two countries are actively exploring the unlimited potential for cooperation in all fields."

The banquet was held in a friendly atmosphere.

On the same day, Zhang Weichao, the Chinese Consul General in Leningrad, also held a banquet to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union.
