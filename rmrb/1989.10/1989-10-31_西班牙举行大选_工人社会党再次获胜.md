Spain held a general election on October 29, with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party securing victory for the third time. This follows their previous victories in 1982 and 1986. The party's general secretary and current prime minister, Felipe González, will continue in his role.

In the election, 72 political parties and alliances participated, vying for 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies and 208 seats in the Senate. According to Spanish law, the party with the most seats in the Congress of Deputies will form the government. The results showed that the Socialist Workers' Party won 176 seats in the Congress, six fewer than in 1986. In the Senate, the party secured 111 seats. The second-largest party, the People's Party, won 106 seats in the Congress, one fewer than in 1986. The Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) won 18 seats, maintaining their 1986 level, while the United Left (IU) won 18 seats, up from 7 in 1986.

Out of Spain's 29.6 million eligible voters, 70% participated in the election.

Since taking power in 1982, the Socialist Workers' Party has achieved notable successes in addressing both domestic and international issues, which contributed to their victory. In foreign relations, Spain joined NATO and the European Community, renegotiated the U.S.-Spain defense treaty, and strengthened ties with Western Europe and the United States. Domestically, the party implemented a series of economic development policies, overcoming severe economic challenges faced at the beginning of their term, and achieving sustained, high-speed economic growth. Spain's international standing has improved, political stability has been maintained, and the living standards of its people have seen improvements.

However, the González government still faces numerous challenges, including high unemployment, rising inflation, inadequate public services, and poor social security.

　　西班牙举行大选
    工人社会党再次获胜
    新华社马德里10月30日电  （记者徐发兴）西班牙工人社会党在29日的大选中再次获胜。这是工人社会党继1982年和1986年后第3次获得大选的胜利。工人社会党总书记、现政府首相费利佩·冈萨雷斯也将连任。
    在29日举行的大选中，共有72个政党和政党联盟参加竞选，共选举350名众议员和208名参议员。西班牙法律规定，由获得众议院席位最多的政党组织政府。选票统计结果表明，工人社会党在众议院获176席，比1986年少得6席。在参议院，工人社会党得111席。第二大党人民党获众议院106席，比1986年少得一席；同盟党获18席，保持了1986年的水平；左派同盟得18席，该党1986年只获7席。
    西班牙2960万选民中70％参加了投票。
    工人社会党自1982年执政以来在解决对内对外重大问题上取得一定成果，是再次获胜的主要原因。在对外关系上，西班牙先后加入了“北约”和欧共体，重新签订了美西防务条约，加强了与西欧和美国的关系。在国内采取了一系列发展经济的政策，克服了执政初期所面临的严重经济困难，使经济得到持续、高速发展。西班牙国际地位提高、政局稳定、人民生活有所改善。
    但是，冈萨雷斯政府仍面临许多困难，如失业率高，通货膨胀回升，公共服务设施落后，社会治安差等等。
