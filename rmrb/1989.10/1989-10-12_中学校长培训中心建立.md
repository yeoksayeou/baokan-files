This center will serve as an important base for training middle school principals and leaders in charge of middle school work in educational administrative departments across the country.

The center will, in accordance with the overall planning and requirements of the State Education Commission for the training of educational management cadres, conduct short-term, off-campus training for middle school principals. It will arrange for them to study the country's educational policies, regulations, and theories, as well as scientific knowledge of school management.
