In the early 1960s, Japanese people went to the movies at least ten times a year on average, but now it is down to just once. Recently, the Kichijoji Theater in Tokyo, which had been in operation for 37 years, closed its doors amid the decline of the film industry. Several other theaters are also facing closure due to a lack of audience. Statistics show that since the beginning of last year, nearly 50 theaters have been forced to shut down, reducing the number of theaters in Japan from about 7,500 in the 1960s to 2,005 by the end of last year. The media has sarcastically referred to the film industry as a "sunset industry."

Japanese film industry professionals attribute this decline to the impact of the video industry. Theater owners complain that new films are quickly copied onto videotapes. A new film, after being released for as little as half a year or as long as a year, will have its videotape available in the market, especially with the proliferation of illegal copies, which are very cheap to rent.

In Japan, there are approximately 13,000 to 14,000 video rental stores. Renting a videotape for a day costs about $2.20 to $2.90, while watching a triple feature at a theater costs $10.80. Theaters simply cannot compete with these video rental stores that are spread throughout the cities and countryside.

In recent years, Japanese theaters have been racking their brains to cope with the impact of the video industry. Some theaters, known for frequently screening serious films, have even resorted to showing adult films to attract audiences, but to no avail. Theater box office revenues have been plummeting, decreasing by about 10% each year since 1986, down to around $500 million. Meanwhile, the video industry's annual revenue has consistently reached around $2.5 billion.

The rapid development of the video industry has attracted many film companies. Those who once looked down on making TV shows are now eagerly filming for the video market. The annual production of films in Japan has decreased from 513 in 1958 to around 100 in recent years. The video industry has brought in huge profits for Japanese film producers. The largest film company, Toho, has 15% of its total revenue coming from videos, while another company, Shochiku, has taken the lead in the video market.

The decline of the Japanese film industry began in the 1960s, accelerated in the 1970s with the increasing home use of video players, and became even more pronounced in the 1980s. The first Tokyo International Film Festival held in 1985 brought a glimmer of hope, but the dream quickly faded, and the decline has only worsened. Whether the film industry can emerge from this "mountains and waters" predicament remains to be seen.

    日本电影业日子难过
    丁刚
    六十年代初，日本人每人每年平均至少去电影院十次，而现在只去一次。不久前，开业三十七年的东京吉祥寺电影院在电影业衰退声中宣告关闭，还有一些电影院也因观众少面临倒闭。据统计，自去年年初以来，已有近五十家电影院被迫关闭，去年底日本的电影院数已从六十年代的大约七千五百家减为二千零五家。舆论界将电影业讽为“斜阳产业”。
    日本电影业人士将这一衰退归咎于录像业的冲击。电影院的老板们抱怨说，新影片的录像带翻制太快，一部新影片上映少则半年多则一年，录像带就会上市，特别是一些非法翻制的录像带充斥市场，且租费很低。
    在日本，大约有一万三千到一万四千家录像带出租店，一盘录像带租一天约需二点二—二点九美元，而看三部片子连映的一场电影则要花十点八美元。电影院根本无力与遍布城乡的这些录像带出租店竞争。
    近年来，日本电影院为应付录像业的冲击，殚精竭虑，一些素以经常放映严肃影片而著称的电影院甚至以黄色影片招徕观众，但仍无法挽回颓势。影院票房收入直线下降，自一九八六年以来每年递减大约百分之十，已减到五亿美元左右。与此同时，录像业的年收入则持续高达二十五亿美元左右。
    录像业的迅速发展吸引了许多电影公司，那些过去对拍电视片不屑一顾的电影公司的老板们纷纷掉转镜头，抢拍录像片。日本全国影片的年产量已从一九五八年的五百一十三部减少到近几年的一百多部。录像给日本电影制片商带来了巨额收入，电影业最大的东宝公司的录像收入已占总收入的百分之十五，另一家松竹电影公司则抢占了录像市场的头把交椅。
    日本电影业的衰退始于六十年代，七十年代随着录像机的逐步家庭化而加速，进入八十年代后则更加显著。一九八五年首次举办的东京国际电影节虽然带来了“柳暗花明”的希望，可好梦转瞬即逝，衰退之势有增无减。如今，电影业能否走出“山重水复”的困境，目前尚难以断言。
