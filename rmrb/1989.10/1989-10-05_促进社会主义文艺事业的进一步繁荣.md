During the enthusiastic celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the second China Art Festival and the first China Film Festival were grandly held. The art festival, which concluded today, featured a rich and diverse array of performances in drama, music, dance, folk art, acrobatics, and other genres, presenting a dazzling spectacle. This indicates that after the severe struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, China's literature and art are showing new signs of prosperity and will continue to do so.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, the vast majority of literary and artistic workers have supported the Party's leadership, been loyal to their duties, and diligently created works. It is because of this that our literature and art have achieved such bountiful results. The Party and the government have given full recognition to this, and the broad masses of the people have also given full recognition to this. During this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, some in the literary and artistic circles participated in the planning and organization, but they are only a tiny minority and do not represent the vast majority of literary and artistic workers. As for those who sympathized with the students' patriotic fervor, expressed support, and even made some extreme statements, their nature is different from the former; it is a matter of raising awareness, and the Party and the government will not change their basic evaluation of literary and artistic workers and literary and artistic work because of this. However, it is also undeniable that the influence of bourgeois liberalization on the literary and artistic front is quite serious. For a considerable period, the voice of insisting on the direction of serving the people and socialism has become weak, and even some people no longer talk about it; the voice of insisting on Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought in literary criticism has become weak, and even some people think it is "outdated"; the connection between writers and artists, society, and the masses has gradually decreased, and some have even strayed further down the path of "nobility" by separating from life and the people. In terms of learning from Western artistic experiences, they have lost their Marxist stance and perspective, failing to analyze and criticize, and allowing bourgeois ideological views to spread unchecked, thereby poisoning many art lovers, especially young artists, who lack critical ability. All of these are facts that must be faced. The rampant bourgeois liberalization led to student movements, turmoil, and ultimately the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. This is not serious? Therefore, there are profound lessons to be learned from this. We calmly reflect on the past and calmly think about the future, focusing on one point: the literary and artistic front must unswervingly implement the Party's basic line, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and carry out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization to the end, thereby promoting the further prosperity of socialist literature and art.

Some people may have doubts: Will opposing bourgeois liberalization affect the prosperity of literature and art? We say that such doubts are unnecessary. Socialist literature and art must have a good social environment to prosper. Opposing bourgeois liberalization is precisely to create a good environment for the prosperity of literature and art. Everyone knows that bourgeois liberalization is fundamentally opposed to adhering to the four cardinal principles. Those who vigorously oppose the four cardinal principles and stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance spread various fallacies that beautify capitalism, negate socialism, oppose the Party's leadership, abolish people's democratic dictatorship, and defame Marxism. In the realm of thought and theory, as well as in literary creation, they have caused great confusion. In the cultural realm and on the literary and artistic front, opposing bourgeois liberalization and clarifying the theoretical issues that have been confused by the bourgeois liberalization trend is precisely to create a good environment for the development of literary and artistic undertakings. Only with this environment can there be a foundation for the prosperity of socialist literature and art. Therefore, only by resolutely and thoroughly opposing bourgeois liberalization and rectifying our ideological line can we promote the healthy development of literature and art.

Will there still be creative freedom and room for exploration after opposing bourgeois liberalization? The answer is also affirmative. The Party's consistent policy is to insist on the "two servings" direction of literature and art while firmly implementing the "hundred flowers and hundred schools" policy. Deng Xiaoping, in his congratulatory speech at the Fourth National Congress of Literature and Art, pointed out: "We will continue to adhere to the direction proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong that literature and art serve the broadest masses of the people, first of all, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and adhere to the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, pushing the old to make way for the new, making foreign things serve China, and making the past serve the present. In artistic creation, we advocate the free development of various forms and styles, and in artistic theory, we advocate the free discussion of various viewpoints and schools." "Around the common goal of realizing the Four Modernizations, the path of literature and art should become wider and wider. Under the guidance of correct creative thought, the themes and methods of artistic creation should become increasingly rich and diverse, and we should dare to innovate." The practice of the past ten years has proven that this important instruction by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is an important guideline for guiding the development of literature and art in the new period. At present, we must unswervingly oppose the bourgeois liberalization trend while also paying attention to fully implementing the Party's literary and artistic policies and seriously grasping the policies. We must guarantee the full creative freedom of literary and artistic workers under the premise of adhering to the "two servings" direction and boldly explore artistic methods and styles. We must seriously criticize erroneous literary and artistic trends and creative tendencies, and boldly support artistic exploration. These are complementary.

To promote the further prosperity of socialist literature and art, we must strengthen and improve the Party's leadership over literary and artistic undertakings. The Party's leadership over literary and artistic undertakings is mainly leadership in terms of policies and guidelines. Our basic policy is to believe in the majority, rely on the majority, and unite the majority, that is, through work and learning, raise awareness, and ultimately unite the vast majority of people. Only in this way can we unite our literary and artistic teams, fully mobilize their enthusiasm, that is, liberate and mobilize the productive forces of literature and art, and strive together for the prosperity of socialist literature and art!

    促进社会主义文艺事业的进一步繁荣
    本报评论员
    在热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年期间，隆重举行了第二届中国艺术节和首届中国电影节。今天结束的这届艺术节，演出的戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、杂技等节目丰富多采，琳琅满目。这说明在经历了制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的严重斗争之后，我国的文艺事业正在出现、并将继续出现新的繁荣。
    改革开放十年来，广大文艺工作者是拥护党的领导，忠于职守，勤于创作的。正因为这样，我们的文艺事业才取得了丰硕的成果。这一点，党和政府曾给予充分的肯定，广大人民群众也给予充分的肯定。在这次动乱和反革命暴乱中，文艺界有的人参与策划和组织，但这只是极少数，他们绝不代表广大文艺工作者；至于同情学生的爱国热情，表示声援，甚至有过一些过激的言论，那是与前者性质不同的，是提高认识的问题，党和政府绝不会因此改变对文艺工作者和文艺工作的基本评价。但是，也不容否认，在文艺战线资产阶级自由化思潮是比较严重的。在相当一个时期内，坚持文艺为人民服务、为社会主义服务方向的声音微弱了，甚至有人不讲了；坚持马克思主义、毛泽东思想的文艺批评的声音微弱了，甚至有人认为“过时”了；作家、艺术家与社会生活、与人民群众的联系逐步减少了，甚至在脱离生活、脱离人民的“贵族化”的道路上越走越远了，在借鉴西方文艺经验方面，丧失马克思主义的立场和观点，不加分析批判，任凭那些资产阶级思想观点泛滥，以致毒害了不少缺乏批判能力的文艺爱好者，特别是文艺青年。凡此种种，都是事实，必须正视。资产阶级自由化的泛滥，导致了学潮、动乱，最后在北京发展成反革命暴乱，这还不严重吗？正因为如此，这里面有深刻的经验教训值得我们反思。我们冷静地思考过去，冷静地思考未来，集中到一点，那就是，我们文艺战线要坚定不移地贯彻执行党的基本路线，坚持四项基本原则，把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争进行到底，从而促进社会主义文艺事业的进一步繁荣。
    人们或许会产生一种疑虑：反对资产阶级自由化会不会影响文艺的繁荣？我们说，这种疑虑是不必要的。社会主义文艺要繁荣必须有一个良好的社会环境。反对资产阶级自由化正是为了创造一个繁荣文艺的好环境。大家知道，资产阶级自由化同坚持四项基本原则是根本对立的。那些竭力反对四项基本原则、顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，肆意散布美化资本主义、否定社会主义、反对党的领导、取消人民民主专政、诋毁马克思主义的种种谬论，在思想理论上，也包括在文艺创作上，造成极大的混乱。在文化领域、文艺战线反对资产阶级自由化，把资产阶级自由化思潮搞混乱了的理论问题，加以澄清，正是为了创造一个发展文艺事业的良好环境。有了这个环境才能有繁荣社会主义文艺的基础。因此，只有坚决彻底地反对资产阶级自由化，端正我们的思想路线，才有利于促进文艺向健康的方向发展。
    反对资产阶级自由化还有没有创作自由，还容不容许探索呢？回答也是肯定的。党的一贯方针是，在坚持文艺的“二为”方向的同时，也坚定不移地贯彻“双百”方针。邓小平同志在第四次全国文代会的《祝辞》中指出：“我们要继续持特毛泽东同志提出的文艺为最广大的人民群众、首先为工农兵服务的方向，坚持百花齐放、推陈出新、洋为中用、古为今用的方针，在艺术创作上提倡不同形式和风格的自由发展，在艺术理论上提倡不同观点和学派的自由讨论。”“围绕着实现四个现代化的共同目标，文艺的路子要越走越宽，在正确的创作思想的指导下，文艺题材和表现手法要日益丰富多采，敢于创新。”十年来的实践证明，邓小平同志的这个重要指示，是指导我们新时期文艺发展的重要指针。在当前，我们要坚定不移地反对资产阶级自由化倾向，同时也要注意全面贯彻党的文艺方针，认真掌握政策。我们要保障文艺家们在坚持“二为”方向的大前提下的充分的创作自由和在艺术方法和艺术风格上的大胆探索。对错误的文艺思潮和创作倾向要进行严肃的批评，对艺术上的探索要大胆支持，这是相辅相成的。
    为了促进社会主义文艺事业的进一步繁荣，要加强和改善党对文艺事业的领导。党对文艺事业的领导，主要是方针政策的领导。我们的基本政策就是相信大多数，依靠大多数和团结大多数，即通过工作，经过学习，提高认识，最终把绝大多数人团结起来。只有这样，才能把我们的文艺队伍团结起来，最充分地调动他们的积极性，也就是解放和调动文艺的生产力，为繁荣社会主义文艺而共同奋斗！
