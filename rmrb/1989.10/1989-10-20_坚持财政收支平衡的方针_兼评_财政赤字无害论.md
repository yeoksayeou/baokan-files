In recent years, there have been two diametrically opposed views on the choice of fiscal policy. One opinion holds that the continuous fiscal deficits are facing serious difficulties, and a tight policy should be implemented to gradually eliminate the deficit to ensure the stable development of the economy. The other opinion, however, suggests that as long as the economy is developing, a bit of deficit is not a problem, and even proposes using deficit budgets and expansionary monetary policies to stimulate economic growth, arguing that inflation is beneficial for economic development. This article will discuss some views on the latter opinion.

I. China Does Not Have the Economic Foundation for Implementing an Expansionary Deficit Policy

Using deficit budgets and increasing the money supply to stimulate economic growth is not a new idea. It was a prescription proposed by Keynes during the Great Depression of the 1930s to alleviate the crisis and recession. However, China does not have the economic foundation for implementing an expansionary deficit policy. First, we are a socialist country, practicing public ownership of the means of production, which eliminates the contradiction between capital and labor. The government and enterprises do not face the problem of unwillingness to invest and improve the living standards of workers, leading to part of the surplus products not being realized. Therefore, fundamentally, the socialist system will not experience periodic economic crises, but only fluctuations when economic work guidance is mistaken. Not only will there be no problem of overproduction and insufficient demand, but there is objectively a long-term contradiction between social production and social needs, and between the accumulation of funds and needs. Therefore, people need to constantly adjust through national planning, arrange the proportion of accumulation and consumption, and seek a balance between production and demand. This means that what we need to pay special attention to is to adhere to the principle of acting within our means, prevent over-allocation of national income, and make the scale of construction match the country's capabilities. If we use the method of expanding deficits and increasing the money supply to expand construction investment and increase workers' income, it will inevitably exacerbate the supply-demand contradiction, trigger inflation, and disrupt the normal development of the national economy. Second, the economic conditions are different. The fundamental problem China has faced in recent years is not one of insufficient demand and overproduction, but rather excessive demand and prominent supply-demand contradictions. From the second half of 1984, the economy overheated, and in 1985, industrial development reached an extremely high speed. Adjustments should have been made, but amidst calls for a "soft landing," the economy took off again without landing, leading to increasingly inflated total demand. Taking the total fixed asset investment of the whole society as an example, in 1986, on the basis of a 38.8% increase over the previous year in 1985, it increased by another 18.7%. In 1987 and 1988, it increased by 20.5% and 18.5% respectively over the previous year, far exceeding the growth rate of the national income. In this situation where total demand exceeds total supply and the supply-demand gap is widening, proposing to use expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate economic growth is like adding fuel to the fire, and will push China's economy into a vicious cycle of fiscal deficits, credit loss of control, excessive currency issuance, excessive demand, inflation, and economic instability. In summary, using deficit budgets to stimulate economic growth in China is theoretically untenable and practically unfeasible.

II. Acknowledge Fiscal Difficulties and Persist with the Policy of Balancing Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure

Over the past decade of reform, the economy has developed rapidly, national strength has significantly increased, and people's income levels have also risen considerably. This is undeniable. However, during these ten years, the national fiscal situation has gone through a process from huge deficits to basic balance, and then from 1986 onwards, continuous deficits. When a 1.7 billion yuan deficit appeared in 1979, the entire nation paid full attention to the fiscal difficulties and proposed the task of achieving fundamental improvement in fiscal and economic conditions. By 1981, the fiscal deficit had been reduced to 2.5 billion yuan. However, when the deficit reappeared in 1986 due to sustained economic overheating, some people did not listen to calls for acting within our means, comprehensive balance, or acknowledging the harm of deficits. Moreover, because they did not allow discussion of over-allocation of national income, they could not find the causes and solutions to fiscal difficulties, leading to increasingly severe fiscal problems.

Fiscal revenue is a comprehensive reflection of the national economy. Economic overheating and excessive demand will inevitably put great pressure on the fiscal situation, leading to serious difficulties. First, economic overheating stimulates enterprises' demand for funds, forcing continued tax cuts and benefits, forcing banks to issue more investment loans, and leading to a sharp increase in enterprises' repayment of principal and interest, causing the proportion of profits turned over to the state by state-owned industrial enterprises to drop sharply. Second, economic overheating, especially the extremely high-speed development of township and collective enterprises, has exacerbated the shortage of resources and worsened the allocation situation, leading to a decline in overall economic efficiency and the proportion of national income in the social total output. Third, excessive demand, coupled with lax control, has disrupted the normal order in the circulation and distribution sector, leading to severe loss of revenue due to price increases and erosion of state taxes and profits. And so on, causing fiscal revenue to be in a state of low or negative growth, with the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income dropping significantly. At the same time, economic overheating and price increases have pushed up various fiscal expenditures, especially various subsidies and expenditures to stabilize prices and ensure workers' living standards, which have grown rapidly. Thus, a sharp contradiction has formed between low or negative growth in fiscal revenue and the rigid and necessary growth in fiscal expenditures. Despite annual tight control of expenditures, there is still a shortage every year, and the situation is getting worse.

We should acknowledge fiscal difficulties. Fiscal revenue not covering expenditures and resulting in deficits actually means that distribution has exceeded the national income created in that year. Without reliable sources of funds to make up for it, the consequences will inevitably be an expanded supply-demand gap, increased currency issuance, price increases, and ultimately endangering the national economy and people's livelihood. The fiscal difficulties since 1986 are not only reflected in fiscal deficits but also, due to financial constraints, have led to a fiscal expenditure structure that is increasingly tilted towards consumption and social development expenditures. The state has little financial strength left to increase investment in key construction projects such as energy, transportation, and raw materials industries, making it difficult to support the improvement of these weak links and posing the danger of increasingly imbalanced economic proportions.

Balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure is a policy we must adhere to. Fiscal balance is the key to comprehensive economic balance. A comprehensive balance based on fiscal balance is a true balance, which can ensure the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy. At present, when we are deeply implementing the policies of rectification and deepening reform, it is particularly important to strive to increase revenue and reduce expenditures, and to compress and eliminate deficits. Adhering to the policy of balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure requires a lot of hard and meticulous work, including eliminating the influence of erroneous views such as the harmlessness of deficits and the use of deficit budgets to stimulate economic growth and the idea that inflation is beneficial for economic development.

III. It Is Possible to Relieve and Reverse Fiscal Difficulties

We should and can take decisive measures in the process of rectification and deepening reform to gradually relieve and reverse fiscal difficulties from the aspects of increasing revenue and reducing expenditures. There are mainly three ways to solve fiscal difficulties: first, adjusting the national economy to achieve coordinated and efficient development; second, with the development of the economy and the improvement of efficiency, adjusting the distribution policy to further concentrate funds; third, thoroughly rectifying the distribution order, collecting what should be collected and reducing what should be reduced. In this way, the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income can be gradually increased from the current 19.3% to 28%. During the current period of rectification and deepening reform, a tight fiscal policy should be implemented, such as compressing excessive total social demand, reducing the rate of price increases; adjusting the industrial structure; rectifying the economic order, and focusing on rectifying the distribution order, adjusting the distribution policy, and strengthening management.

(1) Adhere to the rule of law in taxation and strengthen tax collection and administration.

Taxation is the basic means for the state to obtain fiscal revenue. All citizens and enterprises should establish the concept of paying taxes and voluntarily maintain the seriousness of tax laws. All units and individuals should handle tax registration and tax declaration in accordance with tax laws. Tax authority should be centralized, and no department or locality should reduce or exempt taxes without authorization. Tax reductions and exemptions should be cleaned up and rectified, and those that are not eligible should be corrected. Taxes should be paid in full according to the law once the period expires. Tax collection and administration should be strengthened to resolutely investigate and punish various tax evasion, tax fraud, tax resistance, and tax avoidance behaviors. Adhering to the rule of law in taxation can not only stop tax evasion, tax fraud, tax resistance, and tax avoidance, increasing a large amount of fiscal revenue, but also greatly strengthen the regulatory role of taxation, overcome unfair distribution, promote fair competition among enterprises, and truly focus enterprises' work on tapping internal potential and improving economic efficiency.

(2) Uphold financial discipline and rectify the financial distribution order of enterprises.

Enterprise financial distribution is a basic link in the distribution of social total products and national income. All enterprises must strictly implement the distribution system stipulated by the state. This is a prerequisite for correctly dividing the compensation fund and national income, correctly handling the proportion of accumulation and consumption, and the distribution of interests among the state, enterprises, and workers. The scope of expenditure on costs and operating expenses should be strictly followed, and costs should not be arbitrarily allocated or squeezed. Profits should not be falsely reported to obtain rewards. The extraction ratio of various special funds stipulated by the state should be strictly implemented, and the extraction ratio should not be arbitrarily increased or increased in disguise. Enterprise financial income and expenditure should be truthfully recorded, and income should not be transferred. The state's wage system should be strictly followed, and the phenomenon of arbitrarily issuing bonuses, goods, and allowances should be stopped. Price-increase income should be cleaned up, and taxes and turnover should be paid as required. Various levies and illegal charges should be strictly prohibited, and enterprises' autonomy should be guaranteed. Establishing a normal and standardized financial distribution order is beneficial for stopping the arbitrary allocation of funds, preventing the loss of state income, and also for strengthening the constraint mechanism and enhancing the role of macro-control.

Rectifying the distribution order must also be combined with rectifying the circulation order. In the work of cleaning up and rectifying various companies, various illegal operating incomes should be thoroughly investigated and recovered.

(3) Deepen reform and improve the contract responsibility system.

Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are the main pillars of China's socialist modernization construction and the main source of state fiscal revenue. Various measures should be taken to mobilize the enthusiasm of enterprises and tap the potential of enterprises. The contract responsibility system of enterprises has played an active role in increasing production and cultivating a team of enterprise managers. However, it also faces many difficulties and urgently needs to be improved. Tax and profit division should be actively piloted, and the tax-after-profit contract responsibility system should be tried out. For enterprises that continue to implement incremental contract responsibility in the new round of contracts, the base and incremental rate should be determined in a realistic manner, and the full-staff risk mortgage contract should be actively tried out, the internal management responsibility system of enterprises should be improved, and efforts should be made to tap potential and improve economic efficiency.

(4) Strengthen budget management and strictly control expenditures.

The budgets passed by people's congresses at all levels have legal effect, and all expenditure items can only be reduced, not exceeded, and new expenditures cannot be arbitrarily increased. The execution of annual budgets should not open new windows for reducing revenue and increasing expenditure, and any changes should go through the necessary legal procedures. The responsibility system for tracking and feedback of various fiscal expenditures should be implemented to avoid losses and waste and improve efficiency. Fiscal subsidies should be rectified, and various price subsidies and policy loss subsidies should be strictly controlled by quota and total amount. For false reporting, embezzlement, or misappropriation of price subsidies, strict investigation and punishment should be carried out.

(5) Persist in hard work, oppose extravagance and corruption.

In recent years, as life has become a bit better, high consumption has been advocated, and due to weak ideological and political work and imperfect legal system, various waste phenomena have spread, and the trend of extravagance and waste has become increasingly rampant. Phenomena such as seeking personal gain, embezzlement, bribery, and bribe-taking have also emerged and spread, which not only waste and erode a large amount of state assets but also seriously damage the image of the Party and the government, causing a very bad political influence. Hard work, clean government, and law-abiding education should be carried out to curb the trend of extravagance and waste, and corruption should be resolutely punished. While strengthening the construction of clean government within the financial and tax departments, the management of funds should be strengthened, and from budget approval to execution, every step should be carefully calculated and strictly controlled to ensure that every expenditure achieves the best effect. Effective measures should be taken to actively clean up various off-budget funds. Doing these works can not only save a large amount of funds for the state but also, more importantly, play a significant role in eliminating corruption, stopping extravagance and waste, and strengthening clean government construction.

In summary, we should start from reality, strive to relieve fiscal difficulties, and through promoting the coordinated and efficient development of the economy, create conditions for adjusting the distribution pattern of national income, fundamentally overcoming fiscal difficulties, and improving the support and control capabilities of fiscal policy for reform and construction.

    坚持财政收支平衡的方针
    ——兼评“财政赤字无害论”
    黄菊波
    近年来，在财政政策的选择上，理论界出现两种截然不同的观点。一种意见认为，财政连年赤字面临严重困难，应当实行紧缩政策，逐步消灭赤字，以利于经济的稳定发展；一种意见则认为，只要经济发展，有点赤字也不怕，甚至提出了用赤字预算和扩张的货币政策来刺激经济增长，通货膨胀有益于经济发展的观点。本文对后一种观点提出一些看法。
    一、中国不存在实行赤字扩张政策的经济基础
    用赤字预算和增加货币供应量的办法来刺激经济增长，不是什么新观点，它是三十年代资本主义经济大萧条时期凯恩斯为缓解危机和衰退开的一张药方。但在中国不存在实行赤字扩张政策的经济基础。第一，我们是社会主义国家，实行生产资料公有制，消除了资本与劳动的对立，政府和企业都不存在不愿意去投资和提高职工生活而使一部分剩余产品不能实现的问题。因此，从根本上说，社会主义制度不会发生周期性经济危机，而只有在经济工作指导发生失误的情况下才会出现波动；不仅不会出现生产过剩和需求不足的问题，而且恰恰是客观上长期存在着社会生产与社会需要之间的矛盾、资金积累可能与需要之间的矛盾，因而需要人们经常通过国家计划去调节，安排积累与消费的比例关系，求得生产与需求之间的平衡。这也就是说，在我们这里需要引起特别注意的问题是，必须坚持量力而行，防止搞国民收入超分配，使建设的规模与国力的可能相适应。如若用扩大赤字和增加货币供应量的办法去扩大建设投资，增加职工收入，必然会扩大供需矛盾，引发通货膨胀，干扰国民经济的正常发展。第二，经济条件不同。我国近几年来面临的问题根本不是什么需求不足、生产过剩的问题，而是需求过旺，供需矛盾突出。从1984年下半年起的经济过热到1985年出现工业超高速发展，理应进行经济调整，但在一片“软着陆”声中未经着陆而又继续起飞，以致总需求愈益膨胀。以全社会固定资产投资总额为例，1986年在1985年比上年增长38.8％的基础上又增长了18.7％，1987年和1988年又分别比上年增长了20.5％和18.5％，大大超过了国民生产总值的增长速度。在这种总需求超过总供给，供需差率越来越大的情况下，提出用扩张的财政政策和货币政策来刺激经济增长，无疑是火上加油，而会使我国经济日益陷入财政赤字、信贷失控、货币超量发行、需求过旺、通货膨胀、经济不稳的不良循环中去。总之，在中国用赤字预算来刺激经济增长，在理论上讲不通，实践上绝对办不得。
    二、正视财政困难，坚持财政收支平衡的方针
      改革十年来，经济发展很快，国力显著增强，人民收入水平也有较大提高，这是有目共睹，无可置疑的。但是在这十年中国家财政却经历了从巨额赤字到基本平衡，又从1986年起连续出现赤字的这一由好转到重新出现困难的过程。当1979年出现170亿元赤字的时候，举国上下充分重视财政困难，提出了争取财政经济根本好转的任务，到1981年财政赤字即降为25亿元。但当1986年因经济持续过热，重新出现赤字，人们提出财政困难的时候，却有人听不进去，不讲量力而行，不搞综合平衡，无视赤字的危害；更由于不让提国民收入超分配，也就无从寻找财政困难的原因与对策，而使财政日益陷入困境。
      财政是国民经济的综合反映，经济过热、需求过旺，也必然会给财政带来巨大压力而面临严重困难。首先，经济过热刺激了企业的资金需求，迫使继续减税让利，迫使银行增发投资贷款和由此引起企业还本付息支出剧增，使国营工业企业实现利润中上交财政的比重急剧下降。其次，经济过热，特别是乡镇企业和集体企业的超高速发展，加剧了资源的紧缺程度及其配置状况的恶化，使总体经济效益下降，国民收入占社会总产值的比重下降。第三，需求过旺，加上控制不严冲击了流通分配领域中的正常秩序，涨价收入流失和侵蚀国家利税的现象十分严重，如此等等，使财政收入处于低增长、负增长的状态，财政收入占国民收入的比重大幅度下降。与此同时，经济过热、物价上涨又把各项财政支出抬了上去，特别是用于平抑物价、保障职工生活的各项支出和补贴迅猛增长，由此，在财政收入低增长、负增长与财政支出刚性和必不可少的增长之间形成了尖锐的矛盾。尽管年年从紧控制支出，仍然年年入不敷出，日子越来越不好过。
      我们应当正视财政困难。财政收不抵支出现赤字，实际上是分配超过了当年新创造的国民收入。在没有可靠的资金来源可以弥补的情况下，其后果必然是扩大供需缺口，增发货币，物价上涨，最终会危及国民经济和人民生活。1986年以来的财政困难还不仅仅表现在财政赤字上，而且由于财力拮据，也使财政支出结构日益向保消费性支出和社会发展支出倾斜。国家财政已经没有多大财力可以用来增加能源、交通、原材料工业等重点建设投资，难以支持改善这些薄弱环节而使国民经济潜伏着各项比例关系日益失调的危险。
    财政收支平衡是我们必须坚持的方针。财政平衡是国民经济综合平衡的关键，建立在财政平衡基础上的综合平衡才是真正的平衡，才能保证国民经济持久、稳定、协调的发展。在当前深入贯彻治理整顿、深化改革方针的时候，努力增收节支，压缩和消灭赤字尤为重要。坚持财政收支平衡，需要做大量艰苦细致的工作，包括肃清赤字无害和用赤字预算来刺激经济增长，通货膨胀有益于经济发展等错误观点的影响。
    三、缓解和扭转财政困难是可能的
    我们应当也有可能在治理整顿、深化改革中，从增收和节支两方面采取坚决措施，逐步缓解和扭转财政困难。解决财政困难的出路主要有三条，一是调整国民经济，实现国民经济的协调、高效发展；二是随着经济的发展和效益的提高，调整分配政策，进一步集中资金；三是切实整顿分配秩序，把该收入的收上来，该压的支出压下去。这样就可以逐步地把财政收入占国民收入的比重，由现在的19.3％提高到28％。在当前治理整顿时期，要实行紧缩的财政政策，如压缩过大的社会总需求，降低物价上涨幅度；调整产业结构；整顿经济秩序，应把重点放在整顿分配秩序、调整分配政策、强化管理上。
    （一）坚持依法治税，切实加强税收征管工作。
    税收是国家取得财政收入的基本手段，全体公民和企事业单位都要树立纳税观念，自觉维护税法的严肃性。任何单位和个人都要按照税法规定，办理税务登记，进行纳税申报。要集中税权，任何部门、地方不得越权减免税收。要清理整顿减免税，不该减免的应予纠正，已经到期的一律照章纳税。切实强化税收征管工作，对各种偷税、漏税、抗税行为，坚决进行查处。坚持依法治税，不仅可以制止偷、漏、逃、抗，增加一大笔财政收入，而且可以大大强化税收的调控作用，克服分配不公，促进企业公平竞争，把企业的工作重点真正转到挖掘内部潜力，提高经济效益上来。
    （二）严肃财经纪律，整顿企业财务分配秩序。
    企业财务分配是社会总产品和国民收入分配的基本环节，一切企业必须严格执行国家规定的分配制度，这是正确划分补偿基金与国民收入，正确处理积累与消费比例关系和国家、企业、职工三者利益分配关系的前提条件。要严格遵守成本和经营费用的开支范围，不得乱摊乱挤成本，也不得虚报利润骗取奖励。要坚持执行国家核定的各项专用基金的提取比例，不得擅自提高和变相提高提取比例。企业的财务收支必须如实入帐，严禁转移收入；要严格遵守国家的工资制度，制止乱发滥发奖金、实物、津贴的现象。要清理涨价收入，该纳税的纳税，该上交的上交。要严禁各种摊派和乱收费现象，切实保障企业自主权。确立正常的规范的财务分配秩序，有利于制止乱拉乱扯资金，防止国家收入流失，也有利于强化约束机制，增强宏观调控作用。
    整顿分配秩序还必须同整顿流通秩序结合起来，在清理和整顿各类公司的工作中，切实清缴、追缴各种违法经营收入。
    （三）深化改革，完善承包经营责任制。
    江泽民同志指出：全民所有制大中型企业是我国社会主义现代化建设的主要支柱，是国家财政收入的主要来源。要采取各种措施，调动企业的积极性，挖掘企业的潜力。企业承包制，在增加生产、培养企业家队伍等方面起了积极作用。但也面临着许多难点，急需完善。要积极进行税利分流试点，试行税后利润承包责任制。对于在新的一轮承包中继续实行递增包干的企业，要实事求是地核定上交基数和递增率，积极试行全员风险抵押承包，完善企业内部经营责任制，努力挖掘潜力，提高经济效益。
    （四）强化预算管理，从严从紧控制支出。
    各级人代会通过的预算具有法律效力，各项支出指标只能节减，不得超支，更不能随意批条子增加支出。年度预算执行不应再开新的减收增支口子，必须变动的也应经过一定的法律程序。要实行各项财政支出使用的追踪反馈责任制，努力避免损失浪费，提高效益。要整顿财政补贴，对各种价格补贴和政策性亏损补贴，实行严格的定额补贴和总额控制，对于虚报冒领或挪用价格补贴的行为，要严加查处。
    （五）坚持艰苦奋斗，反对铺张奢侈和腐败现象。
    近些年日子好过了一点，就提倡高消费，加上思想政治工作薄弱，法制不健全，以致多方面的浪费现象蔓延，奢侈铺张之风愈演愈烈，以权谋私、贪污盗窃、行贿受贿现象也滋生蔓延，这不仅浪费和侵蚀了国家的大量资财，也严重损害了党和政府的形象，造成极坏的政治影响。要切实进行艰苦奋斗、廉洁奉公、遵纪守法的教育，狠刹奢侈铺张之风，坚决惩治腐败。财税部门在加强自身队伍廉政建设的同时，要强化资金管理，从预算核定到执行，都要精打细算，严格把关，既要谨慎花钱，又要使各项支出发挥最好的效益。要采取有效措施，积极清理各种帐外资金。做好这些工作，不仅可以为国家节约大量资金，更重要的是对于消除腐败，刹住奢侈浪费，加强廉政建设可以起到很大作用。
    总之，我们要从实际出发，努力缓解财政困难，并通过促进经济的协调、高效发展，为调整国民收入分配格局，从根本上克服财政困难，提高财政对改革和建设的支持、调控能力创造条件。
