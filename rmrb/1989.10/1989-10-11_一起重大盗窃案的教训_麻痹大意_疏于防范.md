Recently, the Intermediate People's Court of Anshan City concluded a case involving the theft of public property. The number of criminals and the value of the stolen goods were unprecedented in our city.

Criminals Zhang Yanshao and 10 others committed 74 thefts between March 1986 and November 1987, stealing public property worth over 66,000 yuan. This caused significant losses to state and collective property.

Most of these criminals were migrants from other regions who came to our city. They were able to commit these crimes repeatedly due to the negligence and lack of vigilance in some of our departments.

Firstly, the security measures at the stolen sites were lax, allowing criminals to take advantage. For example, on a night in December 1986, Zhang Yanshao discovered that the Anshan Mining Design Institute's residential building construction site had steel plates stacked outdoors. That night, he used a taxi to steal over a ton of steel plates worth over 1,800 yuan. On the night of October 22, 1987, Zhang and others broke into the storage rooms of two construction sites in Haicheng City, stealing galvanized iron wire, welding rods, and electrical wires worth over 1,600 yuan in less than half an hour. Although these sites had security personnel, most did not fulfill their duties. Some security guards patrolled only the first half of the night and slept the second half; others, knowing that thefts had occurred, hid the facts to avoid fines. Even after the criminals were caught, some management personnel at the stolen sites still denied responsibility. Out of the 74 thefts, 24 were not reported by the stolen sites, amounting to a loss of 13,000 yuan.

Secondly, taxis were used to transport stolen goods, and scrap collectors bought the stolen items, forming a complete chain of theft, transport, and sale. Zhang Yanshao's gang specialized in stealing construction materials, ranging from a few hundred pounds to several tons per theft. To steal more and sell quickly, they paid high prices to hire taxis. The drivers, driven by greed, did not care about the origin of the goods. Scrap collectors intentionally lowered purchase prices to profit from the situation. For instance, the Yujiafang Metal Store in Liaozhong County bought stolen goods from this gang six times between June and August 1987, worth over 6,800 yuan, profiting nearly 3,000 yuan.

Although this theft case has been concluded, with the main criminal Zhang Yanshao sentenced to death and the others receiving varying sentences, it leaves us with much to reflect on.

    一起重大盗窃案的教训
    麻痹大意  疏于防范
    最近，鞍山市中级法院审结了一起盗窃公共财物案件，其罪犯之多，盗窃数额之大，为我市所罕见。
    罪犯张艳超等11人，在1986年3月至1987年11月一年多时间里，先后作案74起，盗窃公共财物总价值66000多元，使国家、集体财产遭受了重大损失。
    这伙罪犯大多是外地流窜来我市的农民和无业人员。他们之所以能作案屡屡得手，主要是由于我们有些部门麻痹大意，疏于防范。
    首先，被盗单位防范不严，犯罪分子乘虚而入。如盗窃犯张艳超于1986年12月的一天，发现鞍山矿山设计院住宅楼工地露天堆放盘圆，当晚便用出租车盗走一吨多，价值1800多元。1987年10月22日夜间，张等又窜至海城市南台建筑公司一队和海城市新台子建筑公司二队工地，不到半小时，分别扒开两个工地的库房后墙，盗走镀锌铁线、电焊条、电线等物，价值1600多元。这些工地虽有人看守，但多数人不尽职守，有的打更人员上半夜巡逻，下半夜睡觉；有的明知被盗，因怕罚款而隐瞒不报。甚至在盗窃分子被抓后，司法机关上门调查核实时，有些单位的管理人员还不认帐。这些犯罪分子作案74起，被盗单位没有报案的达24起，价值1.3万元。
    其次，出租车运赃，废品收购人员买赃，形成了偷、运、销一条龙。张艳超这伙罪犯专门盗窃建筑材料，一次少则几百斤，多则几吨。为了多偷快销，他们不惜花高价雇出租车。而司机只顾挣钱，不管货物是哪来的。收购人员故意压低收购价格，从中得利。如辽中县于家房五金商店在1987年6月至8月间，先后6次低价收购这伙罪犯盗窃的赃物，价值6800多元，从中渔利近3000元。
    这起盗窃案件虽已审结，主犯张艳超被判处死刑，其余各犯也分别被处以死缓、无期徒刑和有期徒刑。但它却留给人们深深的思考。
