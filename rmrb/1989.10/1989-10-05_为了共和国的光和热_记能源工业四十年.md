The energy industry of our country has triumphantly traversed 40 years. Compared to the over 2,000-year history of coal mining and the use of petroleum and natural gas in China, 40 years seem so brief! Yet, in this short span, our country has become the third-largest energy producer in the world: coal production has risen from the ninth position to the second; oil production has climbed from the bottom of the list to the fifth; hydropower installed capacity has moved from the 25th position to the sixth; the annual electricity generation from hydropower and thermal power, second only to the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan, ranks fourth in the world; nuclear power, a significant indicator of a country's economic and technological strength, has also taken solid steps forward...

A History of Struggle and Innovation

History records the state of China's energy industry in 1949 as follows:

- Coal production was 32.4 million tons, with limited mines in disrepair.
- Oil production was 1.2 million tons, with only 8 dilapidated drilling rigs.
- Electricity generation was 4.3 billion kWh, with most equipment damaged and unable to operate normally...

To build a new China's energy industry from such a mess, the Chinese people, under the blockade of imperialism, had no choice but to rely on their own hard work and struggle.

The construction of Foziling, Meishan, Xianghongdian, and Mozitan hydropower stations in the 1950s was a major project directly invested in and built by the state, with a total installed capacity of 127,000 kW. Who could have imagined that the builders used mainly hammers, pickaxes, shovels, and wheelbarrows? The scenes of thousands of workers sweating and pounding the ground are still fresh in the memories of old hydropower workers...

The Daqing oil field battle in the early 1960s was a testament to hard work and innovation, and it was a story of heroism.

Daqing is located in a remote pastoral area. In the early days of the battle, tens of thousands of people rushed to the vast grasslands, with no houses to live in, no vegetables to eat, and insufficient rations. Everyone camped outdoors, drank salty water, and ate wild vegetables.

There were no roads, and transportation was scarce. "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi led his comrades to unload 60-ton drilling rigs from trains using ropes, levers, and wooden blocks, transporting them to the drilling sites.

Without water pipes, drilling had no water. "Iron Man" and his colleagues carried dozens of tons of water by hand to ensure that the first well in Daqing started drilling on time, producing shiny black crude oil. The spirit of Daqing and the spirit of "Iron Man" inspired countless people, adding strength to their journey forward!

Remember in 1975, the "Ten Red Banners" named by the Ministry of Coal included the Mengtou Coal Mine's Tiger Tunneling Team, which had a miner named Chen Dengming. Before the fall of the "Gang of Four," a reporter visited the Tiger Tunneling Team and saw Chen Dengming always going down the mine in dry clothes and coming up in wet clothes. In the tunnels, he pushed coal cars alone, which were supposed to be pushed by two people. He carried beams that three people should lift alone. When asked, "Who do you admire the most?" he replied without hesitation, "Wang Jinxi!"

Chen Dengming and millions of coal miners, with the spirit of "Iron Man," worked tirelessly in the heart of the earth, providing light and heat to the world.

Reform brought vitality to the energy industry in the 1980s, adding new chapters to its history of hard work and innovation.

In 1988, the national coal production reached 979 million tons, electricity generation reached 543 billion kWh, and oil production reached 137 million tons. When asked by a reporter from the China National Petroleum Corporation, General Manager Wang Tao explained, "To a large extent, this is due to the various forms of management contracts implemented by the state in the energy industry since 1981."

Like the State Council's contract for one billion tons of oil production in the petroleum industry, the national key coal mines implemented total input-output contracts, and hydropower construction teams shifted from self-operation to bidding and contracting, introducing competition mechanisms, increasing risk awareness, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of local governments, departments, enterprises, and individual workers.

Science and Technology: The Primary Productive Force

The reporter has witnessed the following scenes:

In the largest coal mine in the country—the Datong Coal Mine, which produces over 33 million tons of coal annually—workers who used to bend over in low coal mines, drilling, blasting, and shoveling coal, now operate comprehensive coal mining machines with the press of a button, sending rolling "black gold" to the surface via conveyor belts. From the pithead power plant, 24 thick silver wires extend to Beijing, delivering strong currents to the capital.

In the largest hydropower station in the country—the Gezhouba Hydropower Station with an installed capacity of 2.715 million kW—the 5-mile-long dam controls the flow of the Yangtze River. Built on a multi-layered soft soil foundation, the 27-chamber spillway can pass 81,000 cubic meters of floodwater per second, generating 14 billion kWh of electricity annually.

In the largest offshore oil field in the country—the Bohai Oil Company, which produces over 40 million tons of oil annually—successors of the "Iron Man" spirit integrate marine navigation, aviation, meteorology, satellites, computers, marine rescue, and marine engineering technologies to extract "oil dragons" from the vast sea floor.

In the largest nuclear power plant in the country—the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant with an installed capacity of 1.8 million kW—the first unit's civil engineering has risen from the ground, and the builders' slogan is, "Let Daya Bay supply nuclear power to China by 1992!"

Facing all this, many people were moved to tears, and many were amazed. They could not help but deeply feel that scientific and technological progress is both an important indicator of China's energy industry development level and a key factor in the revitalization of the energy industry during the reform and opening up.

In the early 1980s, the Ministry of Coal proposed the "Five Transformations" to achieve technological advancements by the end of the century: from manual labor to mechanized operations; from uncontrolled major accidents and occupational diseases to controlled; from small-capacity electric locomotives and transport machines to large-capacity ones; from single coal production to diversified production and gasification, liquefaction development; from single operation to comprehensive operation, developing coal-electricity, coal-chemical, and other joint ventures.

The "Five Transformations" have borne fruit! In 1988, the mechanization rate of coal mining in national key coal mines reached 58%; compared to 1978, the full-time efficiency of coal production increased by 22%, and the death rate per million tons decreased by 68%. About half of the national coal production from local coal mines also gradually improved ventilation, drainage, hoisting, transportation, and power supply systems.

As early as 1979, the petroleum industry, which specifically implemented the open policy, deeply felt the penetration of modern science and technology into all aspects and fields of production. In that year, the chief engineer of Daqing Oil Field, now the director of Zhongyuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau, Jin Yuyan, saw that in developed countries, an oil platform with only a dozen people could produce over 100 million tons of oil annually—equivalent to one of our medium-sized oil fields. A sense of crisis and urgency arose that without pursuing scientific and technological progress, one would inevitably fall behind and be beaten. When the state decided to organize a scientific and technological attack in Zhongyuan Oil Field in 1983, the broad masses of workers transformed the Daqing people's spirit of hard work into a high enthusiasm for studying new technologies. Through the digestion and absorption of advanced technologies, over 300 items have been awarded by the China National Petroleum Corporation and the National Science and Technology Progress Award. Recently, the reporter saw in Zhongyuan Oil Field that the seismic team uses the world's advanced digital seismographs; the drilling team drills oil and gas wells with international standards of the 1980s; well-logging data processing is done using electronic computers...

The Blueprint for the 21st Century

At the beginning of the year, a member of a foreign delegation asked Vice Premier Zhou Jiahua, "What is the elasticity coefficient of China's energy industry development and economic development?" Zhou Jiahua replied: 0.8. The guests were astonished. How could they not be surprised? From the experience of developed countries, the elasticity coefficient of energy growth and economic growth should be slightly higher than 1 during periods of rapid economic growth to promote coordinated economic development.

According to statistics, in 1988, China's primary energy production increased by 4.2% compared to 1987, while the same period's industrial growth rate was as high as 20.7%. For every kilowatt of electricity generated, there are 3 kilowatts of electrical equipment waiting to be used. Economic overheating is one of the main reasons for today's energy shortages.

Currently, the rectification and adjustment have initially shown results, and the energy supply situation has eased compared to the same period last year. Wang Tao said well, "We have no reason to be discouraged because the hope for tomorrow lies in overcoming today's difficulties."

Experts revealed to the reporter: In the future, if the total industrial and agricultural output value is planned to grow at an annual rate of 6%, by the end of the century, China will need to produce 1.4 billion tons of coal, 200 million tons of oil, 240 billion kWh of hydropower, and 30 billion kWh of nuclear power annually.

The Ministry of Energy has provided a blueprint to achieve this grand goal:

- Coal: Focus on developing the Shanxi, Shaanxi, and western Inner Mongolia regions.
- Thermal power: Promote the development of mine-mouth and pithead power plants, changing long-distance coal transportation to power transmission.
- Hydropower: Focus on developing the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and its tributaries, as well as the Hongshui River and Lancang River.
- Nuclear power: Accelerate the construction of the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants.
- Oil: Speed up exploration in Qinghai and Xinjiang regions.

For the light and heat of the People's Republic, hundreds of thousands of energy industry workers are sweating and dedicating their efforts.

    为了共和国的光和热
    ——记能源工业四十年
    本报记者　鹿舫
    我国的能源工业胜利地走过了40个年头。与巍巍中华那2000多年的煤炭开发史以及石油天然气利用史相比，40年何等短暂！可就在这一瞬间，我国成了世界第三能源生产大国：原煤产量从世界第九位跃居第二位；原油产量在世界产油国系列中由忝列末座上升到第五位；水电装机容量由世界第二十五位前移到第六位；水电和火电年发电量累计仅次于美国、苏联、日本，居世界第四位；作为当代各国经济、科技实力的一个重要标志——核电工业，也迈出了坚实的步伐……
    一部艰苦创业史
    历史老人是这样书写1949年中国能源工业状况的：
    ——原煤产量3240万吨，有限的几个煤矿百孔千疮；
    ——原油产量12万吨，总共只有8台破旧钻机；
    ——发电量43亿度，多数发电设备残缺不全，不能正常运转……
    要在这样一个烂摊子上建设新中国的能源工业，当年处在帝国主义封锁下的中国人民除了自己艰苦奋斗，还能有什么别的选择？
    50年代兴建的佛子岭、梅山、响洪甸、磨子潭水电站，算是国家直接投资和施工的大型骨干工程了，总装机容量达12.7万千瓦，可是谁能想象，这些工程的建设者使用的主要劳动工具却是一柄柄铁锤、一根根钢钎、一把把十字镐和一辆辆手推车。那万头攒动、挥汗如雨、夯声动地的劳动景象，至今还留在老水电职工的记忆中……
    60年代初打响的大庆石油会战是一部艰苦创业史，更是可歌可泣。
    大庆地处边远牧区，会战初期，几万人涌到茫茫的大草原上，没有房住，没有菜吃，粮食定量不够，大家就在野外露营，喝盐水，吃野菜。
    没有公路，缺少运输工具，“铁人”——王进喜带领小伙子们用绳子拉，撬扛撬，木块垫，把60多吨重的钻机从火车上卸下来，运进了井场。
    来不及铺设水管线，开钻没有水，“铁人”和工友们又硬是用双手端来几十吨水，保证了大庆会战的第一口井提前开钻，打出了乌黑发亮的原油。而百万石油职工创造出的大庆精神、铁人精神，又使多少人从中吸取了革命的营养，增添了前进的力量！
    记得1975年被煤炭部命名的十面红旗之一——淮北煤矿猛虎掘进队有一位名叫陈登明的矿工。“四人帮”覆灭前夕，记者去猛虎掘进队采访，只见陈登明总是一身干衣服下井，一身湿衣服上井。在巷道里推矿车，规定两人推一辆，他却一人推一辆。三个人合抬的棚梁，他一人扛起就走。有人问他“最钦佩的人是谁？”他毫不犹豫地回答：“王进喜！”
    陈登明和千千万万煤矿工人以铁人精神常年在地球的心脏采掘不止，把光和热源源不断地送到人间。
    改革，给80年代能源工业带来了蓬勃生机，为能源工业艰苦创业史写下了新的篇章。
    1988年，全国原煤产量达9.79亿吨、发电量达5430亿千瓦小时、原油产量达1.37亿吨。记者向中国石油天然气总公司王涛总经理请教：“该怎样解释这些新记录呢？”他说：“在很大程度上归功于国家从1981年起先后对能源工业各部门实行了多种形式的经营承包制。”
    像国务院对石油工业实行一亿吨原油产量包干，全国统配煤矿实行投入产出总承包，水电建设队伍从自营转向招标承包，引入竞争机制，增加风险意识，充分调动了地方、部门、企业和职工个人多方面的积极性。
    科学技术是第一生产力
    记者耳闻目睹过这样一些画面：
    在全国最大的矿务局——年产原煤3300多万吨的大同煤矿，以往在低矮的煤洞中弯腰弓背、打眼放炮、挥锹攉煤的工人，现在按着电钮，操纵着钢铁走廊般的综合采煤机，滚滚“乌金”顺着皮带运输机送到地面；从坑口电厂延伸出的24根杯口粗的银线，把强大电流输向首都。
    在全国最大的水电站——装机271.5万千瓦的葛洲坝水利枢纽工程，5里长的大坝镇江锁流，在多层软泥化地基上兴建起来的27孔泄水闸，每秒钟可以通过81000立方米的洪峰，年发电量达140亿千瓦小时。
    在全国最大的海上油田——年产原油40多万吨的渤海石油公司，“铁人”事业的继承者们集航海、航空、气象、卫星、电脑、海上抢险、海洋工程等技术于一身，从浩瀚的海底牵出了“油龙”。
    在全国最大的核电站——装机180万千瓦的大亚湾核电厂，第一个机组的土建工程已拔地而起，建设者们的口号是“让大亚湾1992年为中华大地输出核能电力！”
    面对这一切，多少人激动得涌出了热泪，多少人惊奇得睁大了眼睛！他们不能不深切地感受到：科技进步，既是我国能源工业发展水平的重要标志，又是能源工业在改革开放中得以振兴的关键性因素。
    80年代初，煤炭部就提出了到本世纪末实现以改变技术面貌为主的“五个转变”，即：由手工作业转变为机械化作业；由不能控制重大恶性事故和职业病的发生到能够控制；由小吨位的电机车、运输机转变为大吨位的电机车、运输机运煤；由单一生产原煤转变为多品种生产和向气化、液化发展；从单一经营转变为综合经营，发展煤电、煤化以及其他方面的联营。
    “五个转变”如今结出了硕果！1988年全国统配煤矿采煤机械化程度达58％；与1978年相比，原煤全员效益提高了22％，百万吨死亡率下降了68％。约占全国煤炭产量一半的地方煤矿也逐步改善了通风、排水、提升、运输、供电系统。
    早在1979年就具体实施开放政策的石油工业界，对现代科学技术已渗透到生产的一切环节和领域，感受尤深。当年大庆采油总工程师、现任中原石油勘探局局长金毓荪，眼瞅着发达国家一座只有十余人作业的采油平台年产原油上百万吨——相当于我们的一个中等油田，一种不追求科技进步就必然落后挨打的危机感和紧迫感油然而生。当1983年国家决定在中原油田组织科技攻关会战时，广大职工把大庆人的艰苦创业精神变为刻苦钻研新技术的高度热忱。通过消化、吸收引进先进技术，至今已获石油天然气总公司和国家科技成果奖300多项。日前记者在中原油田看到，这里地震队用的是世界上先进的数字地震仪；钻井队打的是具有八十年代国际水平的油气井；测井资料处理用电子计算机进行……
    本世纪的蓝图
    年初，一个外国代表团成员问国务委员邹家华：“中国能源工业发展与经济发展的弹性系数是多少？”邹家华回答：是0.8。客人愕然了。他们怎能不吃惊呢？从发达国家走过的道路看，在经济大幅度上升时期，能源增长与经济增长的弹性系数应稍高于1，才能促进经济协调发展。
    据统计，1988年我国一次能源生产比1987年增长4.2％，而同期工业增长速度却高达20.7％。全国每发出1千瓦电，就有3千瓦用电设备等着用。经济过热是今天能源紧张的主要原因之一。
    目前治理整顿已经初步收到效果，能源供应紧张局面较之去年同期已有所缓和。王涛同志说得好：“我们没有理由气馁，因为明天的希望正在于克服今天的困难。”
    有关专家向记者披露：今后工农业总产值如按年均增长6％的速度规划，到本世纪末，我国一年相应地需要生产原煤14亿吨、原油2亿吨、水电2400亿千瓦小时、核电300亿千瓦小时。
    能源部已经给出了实现这一宏伟目标的蓝图：
    ——煤炭，重点开发山西、陕西和内蒙古西部地区。
    ——火电，大力发展矿区和坑口电站，变长途运煤为输电。
    ——水电，重点开发黄河上中游、长江上游干支流以及红水河、澜沧江。
    ——核电，抓紧建设秦山和大亚湾核电厂。
    ——石油，加快在青海和新疆地区的勘探。
    为了人民共和国的光和热，数百万能源行业职工正在洒下新的汗水和付出更多的心血。
