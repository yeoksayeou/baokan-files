A black Volga drove out of Beijing, through Changping, past the ancient and majestic Great Wall at Badaling, and sped towards Kangzhuang.

Inside the car were Xu Bu'an, deputy director of the Political Department's Organization Section of the Second Artillery's Logistics Department, and Sun Lancheng, an official from the Propaganda Section. They were following the instructions of the Second Artillery's Logistics Department leaders to investigate corruption issues involving Cao Honglin, an assistant at a certain warehouse.

This warehouse had been criticized for poor management during a military-wide inspection in 1983. Two years had passed, and someone had written to the Second Artillery's Logistics Department, exposing that the warehouse's assistant in charge of materials and construction, Cao Honglin, not only accepted bribes from workers but also colluded with and bribed other officials, making the management even more chaotic. Such a "troublemaker"! The leaders of the Logistics Department were furious.

They arrived at the warehouse. This was a large comprehensive warehouse of the Second Artillery, mainly storing steel, wood, and mechanical equipment, with an annual turnover of tens of millions of yuan in materials. How could such an important warehouse be poorly managed without causing concern?

The two investigators began their meticulous work. However, they felt like they had entered a maze; the accusations against Cao Honglin seemed like fleeting illusions, vanishing as soon as they tried to pursue them. Cao Honglin presented a different image:

"This person is upright and skilled in his work. He has been angry about the chaotic situation in the warehouse for a long time and has offended some people."

"The assistant is genuinely concerned about the warehouse's construction. If he were in charge, the warehouse would definitely improve!"

"People like Cao Honglin, who are clean and hate evil, are not many. Some people in the warehouse are afraid of Cao Honglin becoming the leader."

There were also those who spoke in Cao Honglin's defense.

The sun was setting behind the mountains. An old man and a middle-aged man, both sweaty, burst into the investigators' room:

"We are from the construction team here." The older one said as soon as he entered, "Your assistant, Cao, is too unreasonable. He always picks on us. For example, he deducted 30% of the volume for a slight overestimation in the stone measurement; he insisted on returning the sand because it contained too much soil. Even if we were wrong, we sent him some local specialties, but he not only refused to accept them but also threw them out in front of everyone and scolded us, 'Don't let your hearts go astray. If you don't want to work, just leave!'"

It turned out to be like this. Soon, Zhao Guofu, the political commissar of the Second Artillery's Logistics Department, told Cao Honglin, "There are people who accuse you, but there are also people who defend you. I not only agree with defending you but also with using you! Don't be afraid, just do your work as you see fit!" Cao Honglin looked at the old leader and couldn't help but cry.

Cao Honglin had been promoted to deputy director of the warehouse for more than two years. With the strong support of the warehouse's party committee, he managed the warehouse in an orderly manner, twice ranking in the top four in the entire military, and was commended by the General Logistics Department.

In recent years, Cao Honglin's achievements were remarkable. He held the power over the entry and exit of thousands of tons of materials, the approval of annual invoices worth 100,000 yuan, and the approval of hundreds of millions of yuan in construction tasks, making people envious. Some said that in Cao Honglin's position, he didn't need to do anything else; as long as he wasn't too strict, his family would have everything they needed. Others saw through this, and Cao Honglin understood it even more. Therefore, after becoming the deputy director, he told his wife, "I only ask you one thing: no matter who sends gifts or money, ensure that not a single cent is accepted. Otherwise, don't blame your harsh husband for not recognizing you as his wife!"

Despite Cao Honglin's severe punishments, public reprimands, and heartfelt advice to those who tried to bribe him, the attempts continued like bees swarming around a blooming flower, impossible to drive away. Some would openly give gifts, and he would throw them out the door. What angered Cao Honglin the most was when some people sent gifts anonymously, leaving them at the doorstep at night and slipping away. At first, Cao was at a loss on how to handle this, and his wife reminded him, "If you can't find the person to return the gifts, just hand them over to the warehouse."

Over the years, Cao Honglin had refused countless bribes, but he could clearly say one thing: he had not accepted a single cent of illicit money. A leader of a construction team that had worked in the warehouse for several years once held Cao Honglin's hand and said, "In the past, I thought your integrity was just an act, but after several years, I genuinely admire you from the bottom of my heart!"

A construction foreman from Yanqing County, who had tried to bribe Cao Honglin three times with red envelopes and gifts, finally said half-admiringly and half-regretfully, "Deputy Director Cao, you are indeed a good Communist Party official. But you are too stubborn, a bit foolish. I dare say, people like you may not be able to stand firm or get along well."

Unfortunately, Cao Honglin was proven right by this foreman. He never imagined that being clean and upright could offend people; even more, he never imagined that some people could be so vicious, even targeting his wife and children.

In July 1987, someone else wrote a letter to the Second Artillery's Logistics Department accusing him. Soon, the Second Artillery's Logistics Department's disciplinary committee sent people to the warehouse to investigate. When the disciplinary committee officials refuted the false accusations of "not accepting bribes is a lie" and "selling diesel" at the warehouse's full military meeting, his honest heart trembled: "How could such rumors be spread about me, and so openly?"

He couldn't help but sigh in relief, "Fortunately, the higher authorities came to clarify this!"

After this incident, Cao Honglin felt refreshed. He never imagined that during the warehouse's party committee election in 1988, some people would collude to try to remove him. He didn't eat or sleep well for several days, unable to understand why some people hated him so much.

"Old Cao, evaluating an official's character and achievements isn't just about looking at the votes. Sometimes, losing a few votes can actually prove a person's value." The Political Department of the Second Artillery's Logistics Department sent someone to comfort him.

But soon, his family's chickens were stolen, his wife's keys and other items went missing while she was taking a bath; his two young children were often beaten on their way to school and didn't dare tell their parents. One afternoon after school, his 10-year-old son told his father, who was cooking, "Dad, I don't want to go to school anymore." Cao Honglin was startled: "Why?" His son, who had already cried red-eyed, couldn't help but burst into tears again: "They beat me, I'm afraid." Cao Honglin hugged his son and instinctively touched his son's head, suddenly startled to find a large lump the size of an egg on the left side of his head, "When did this happen?" "More than ten days ago, hit with a stone. I was afraid you and mom would be angry, so I didn't dare say. They often beat me. Just now on the way, they choked my neck with their hands, almost suffocating me." "Why do they beat you?" "They say you punished their family."

"Heavens!" Cao Honglin couldn't help but cry out loud, hugging his son. He said between sobs, "Why do you have to suspect me so recklessly, why vent your hatred on innocent children..."

His wife came home from work, crying loudly in anger. She wanted to kneel down to her husband, begging him to quit and return to their old home in the countryside.

Cao Honglin was furious: "No, I'm not afraid. I haven't done anything wrong. Those who should be afraid are the ones who are guilty."

Cao Honglin was not alone. He received the understanding and support of his superiors, the warehouse leaders, and the masses. The Second Artillery's Logistics Department's disciplinary committee forwarded his deeds several times, and the Second Artillery's disciplinary committee issued an order commending him.

    被状告出的好干部
    张家军　刘明炉
    （一）
    黑色的伏尔加驶出北京驶过昌平，穿过古老雄伟的长城八达岭向康庄方向急驰。
    车内坐的是二炮后勤部政治部组织处副处长徐步安和宣传处干事孙兰成。他们是奉二炮后勤部领导指示，去调查所属某仓库助理员曹红林的腐败问题。
    这个仓库在1983年全军大检查时因为管理混乱而受到批评。如今，两年过去了，有人给二炮后勤部机关写信，揭发管物资和营建的助理员曹红林不但接收过民工的贿赂，还拉拢收买其他干部，管理混乱加了个“更”字。有这样的“祸根”！后勤部领导震怒了。
    到仓库了。这是二炮一个大型综合仓库，主要储存钢材、木材、机械设备等物资，年吞吐物资价值数千万元。这样重要的仓库管理不好怎能不让人忧心忡忡？
    两位调查人员开始了深入细致的工作。然而，他们像闯进了迷宫，告曹红林为“祸根”的那些事如飘渺的幻影，他们一追便没影了。曹红林现出了另一幅图像：
    “这人耿直、业务精，对仓库的混乱局面早就有气，得罪了一些人。”
    “曹助理是真心地爱仓库，关心仓库建设，要是让他担任领导，仓库准能搞好！”
    “像曹红林这样洁身自好、疾恶如仇的人不太多。仓库里有些人怕曹红林当领导。”
    说曹红林不是的，也有。
    夕阳压山。一老一中带着一股汗臭味撞开了调查人员的门：
    “我们是这里包工队的。”老的一进门就气鼓鼓地说开了：“你们那个曹助理，太不讲人情，常跟我们过不去。拉石量方，小青年调皮码虚了点，被他查出硬是扣了我们30％的方数；拉沙含土量大了点，他硬逼着给拉回去了。还有，就算我们办得不对，给他送了点土特产什么的，他不要也罢，当着那么多人把东西给我们扔出去，他还红着眼骂我们‘心不要长偏了，不愿干就滚！’”
    原来如此。不久，二炮后勤部政委赵国福找曹红林说：“对你这个干部有告的，有保的，我不但赞成保，还赞成用！不要怕，该怎么干就怎么干！”曹红林望着老首长忍不住哭了。
    （二）
    曹红林提为仓库副主任两年多了。他在仓库党委的大力支持下，把个仓库管理得井然有序，两次进入全军前四名，受到总后表彰。
    曹红林这几年干出的成绩显眼，他手握数千吨物资进出、一年10万元发票签报和批准数百万元营建任务的大权更令人红眼。有人说在曹红林这个位置上，不需别的，只要他不那么认真，他那个小家吃的、用的、玩的、花的，都不用他操心。这种事外人看得透，曹红林心里更明白，所以，当了副主任后他就对妻子说：“我只求你一点，无论什么人采取什么方式送物、送钱，要保证一文一点都不沾，不然，别怪狠心丈夫不认妻啊！”
    尽管曹红林狠狠惩治过、当面责骂过、苦口婆心劝说过送礼的，可行贿送礼的如同蜜蜂盯上了怒放的花蕊，打不开、赶不跑。明送好说，当面让他拿走，不拿就扔出门外。最令曹红林气愤的是一些人暗送，人不照面，夜晚把东西丢在门口就溜。开始老曹觉得不好处理，气得骂，多亏妻子提醒了一句，“找不到人退还，就交给仓库去好了。”
    几年来，曹红林拒了多少次贿，他已记不清，可有一点他能说得清：不义之财，点滴分文没沾没捞。在仓库干了几年的施工队一位领导曾握着曹红林的手说：“过去，我对你清廉一直以为是装的、假的，几年过来了，我从心底敬佩你！”
    （三）
    一位3次送红包、3次送礼品连遭曹红林严厉拒绝的延庆县的包工头，最后半是佩服半是遗憾地说：“曹副主任，你确实是共产党的一位好干部。可也太死心眼，傻了点。我敢说，像你这种人未必能立得住，吃得开。”
    曹红林不幸被这位包工头言中。他没有想到，洁身自好也会得罪人；更没有想到有些人那样狠，连他的妻子儿女也不放过。
    1987年7月，又有人写信向二炮后勤部告他的状。不久，二炮后勤部纪委派人来仓库调查。当纪委的同志在仓库全体军人大会上为他辟“不受贿是假”、“倒卖柴油”等诬告谣言时，他那颗耿直的心颤抖了：“怎么会造我这种谣，还堂而皇之地上告？”他忍不住一声长叹：“多亏上级机关来澄清啊！”
    此事过后，曹红林感到神清气爽。他哪里想到，1988年仓库改选党委时，有些人串通起来想把他拉下马。他几天没吃好，几夜没睡好，想不通为什么有些人那样恨他。
    “老曹，考核一个干部的德行、政绩不是光看选票。有时候丢几张选票，恰好证明了一个人的价值。”二炮后勤部政治部派人给他送来了温暖。
    可不久，他家的鸡被人偷了，妻子洗澡，兜里钥匙等物不翼而飞；两个小孩子上学路上常常挨打，回家还不敢跟爸爸妈妈说。一天下午放学后，10岁的儿子对正在做饭的爸爸说：“爸，我不上学了。”曹红林一惊：“为什么？”已哭红了眼的儿子忍不住哇地一声又哭开了：“他们打我，我怕。”曹红林一把将儿子抱在怀里，下意识地用手一摸儿子的头，不觉一惊，头顶左边有一个鸡蛋大的坑，“这是什么时候打的？”“10多天了，用石块砸的，我怕你和妈妈生气，没敢说。他们经常打我，刚才在路上又用手掐我的脖子，差点把我憋死。”“他们为什么打你？”“说你整了他家的人。”
    “天哪！”曹红林听到这里忍不住搂着儿子失声痛哭了。他边哭边说：“你们凭什么这样胡乱猜疑我曹红林，为什么对我的恨要发泄到不懂事的孩子身上啊……”
    下班回来的妻子气得失声痛哭，她要给丈夫下跪，哀求他不干了，一块回农村老家。
    曹红林急了：“不回。我不怕，我没做亏心事，心虚害怕的应该是他们。”
    曹红林不是孤立的，他得到了上级领导和仓库领导及群众的理解和支持。二炮后勤部纪委几次转发了他的事迹，二炮纪委通令表彰了他。
