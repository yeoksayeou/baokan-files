In the capital of Mozambique, Maputo, a giant sea turtle was injured and stranded on the beach. Nearby fishermen rushed to the scene, and one of them quickly reported the incident to the National Museum of Natural History of Mozambique. The museum director arrived promptly and carefully bandaged the turtle's wound. After treatment, the turtle regained its spirit and returned to the sea. This small incident shows that the awareness of protecting wildlife among Africans is increasing.

Africa is the continent with the richest wildlife resources, but many species are now facing extinction. In just a quarter of a century, the number of animals in Africa has decreased by 90%, and in some countries that rely on wildlife for tourism, the rate of decline is even more alarming.

Last December, experts from the International Union for Conservation of Nature pointed out that animal resources in Chad have decreased by 80%, in Sudan by 90%, and in Uganda by 97%. Some natural zoos are becoming empty. Among the 1,200 species listed as threatened by the organization, many are found in Africa, such as the dwarf crocodile, python, giraffe, monkey, rhinoceros, antelope, hippopotamus, and elephant. Statistics show that the number of rhinoceros in the entire African continent has decreased by 92% compared to 15 years ago, leaving only 3,000. A single rhinoceros horn can be sold for 10,000 French francs in Europe, and the desire for wealth drives poachers. About 100,000 elephants are killed in Africa each year, many of which are female and young elephants. Additionally, some animals have become targets of illegal trade, such as parrots, monkeys, and various reptiles. They are packed in boxes and crates and shipped to Europe, the United States, and other places for sale.

The main reason for the sharp decline in African wildlife is the rampant poaching, which uses guns, poisons, and traps to hunt animals. Some villagers also catch animals, either for their own consumption or to sell in the market. Internal wars in some countries have brought misfortune to wildlife. Furthermore, drought, desertification, and the reduction of forest areas have altered the ecological environments that some animals depend on for survival, leading to the death of many animals.

An article in the Abidjan-based "Charity Weekly" states: "In just a few years, Africa has lost 3/4 of its wildlife resources. Dozens of species are facing extinction. If we do not resolutely fight against poachers and illegal trade, humanity will face the disaster of having no wildlife." (Accompanying photo)

    非洲野生动物的厄运
    本报记者　杨汝生
    在莫桑比克首都马普托的海滩上，一只巨大的海龟因受伤突然“搁浅”，在附近作业的渔民纷纷跑来，其中一位迅即去报告莫桑比克全国自然历史博物馆。博物馆负责人闻讯而至，仔细给海龟包扎好伤口。经过治疗，海龟顿时精神起来，重新返回了大海。这件小事表明，非洲人保护野生动物的意识在增强。
    非洲是野生动物资源最丰富的大陆，可是，许多种动物目前都面临绝迹的危险。在1／4的世纪里，非洲的动物竟减少了90％，一些靠动物发展旅游业的国家，动物减少的速度更为惊人。
    去年12月，国际自然保护组织的一些专家指出，乍得的动物资源减少了80％，苏丹的减少了90％，乌干达的减少了97％，一些天然动物园正在变空。在该组织开列的1200种受到威胁的动物中，有许多种都在非洲，如钝吻鳄、蟒蛇、长颈鹿、猴子、犀牛、羚羊、河马和大象等。据统计，整个非洲大陆的犀牛较15年前减少了92％，只剩下了3000只。一只犀牛角在欧洲可卖1万法国法郎，发财的欲望刺激着偷猎者。非洲大象每年约有10万头被杀，其中有不少是母象和幼象。此外，还有一些动物也成了非法交易的对象，如鹦鹉、猴子及各种爬行类动物，它们被成箱成笼地装上飞机和轮船，贩运到欧洲、美国和其他地方出售。
    非洲野生动物急剧减少的主要原因是偷猎者的大肆捕杀，他们用枪支、毒药、陷阱等手段猎取动物。一些村民也捕捉动物，或供自己食用，或到市场上出售。某些国家的内战给野生动物带来不幸。另外，干旱、沙漠化和森林面积的减少，改变了某些动物赖以生存的生态环境，也使一些动物死亡。
    阿比让出版的《博爱周刊》在一篇文章中写道：“短短几年内，非洲已经失去3／4的动物资源。数十种动物面临绝境。若不对偷猎者和非法交易进行坚决的斗争，人类将面临没有野生动物的灾难。”（附图片）
