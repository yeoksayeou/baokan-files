Two Chinese young footballers to study in England

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 13th - Reporter Wang Dazhao reports: Two young players from the Chinese youth football team, defender Wu Chongwen and striker Su Maozhen, will depart on October 15th to receive training at the famous Manchester football club in England.

    Last year, these two young players participated in the world football skills test conducted by British coach Bobby Charlton. Among the more than a thousand young players from various countries who took the test, Wu Chongwen ranked second, and Su Maozhen ranked fifth. This summer, they participated in the 16-year-old world football championship with the Chinese youth team and performed well.

    According to the plan, during their two-and-a-half-month "study abroad" period, they will learn football skills, tactics, and physical fitness from their British counterparts and may have the opportunity to play as foreign players in Manchester United's youth team matches.
