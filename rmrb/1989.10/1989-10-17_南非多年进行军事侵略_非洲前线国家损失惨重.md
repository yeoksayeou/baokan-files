Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, October 13th.

A report released by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa today estimates that from 1980 to 1988, South Africa's military aggression against neighboring countries resulted in economic losses amounting to $60 billion and caused the deaths of 1.5 million people.

The report indicates that the military aggression policy pursued by the South African apartheid regime, which creates chaos in neighboring countries, is the primary cause of the economic decline in these nations. Without South Africa's military aggression, the production in these countries could have significantly increased by 1988.

Years of continuous warfare have led to the deaths of 750,000 children under the age of five, displaced 1.5 million people who have become refugees, and left approximately 6 million people homeless.

The report emphasizes that the South African authorities' repeated military aggression against neighboring countries is fundamentally aimed at maintaining these frontline states' economic dependence on it, thereby continuing to politically subjugate these countries.

    南非多年进行军事侵略  非洲前线国家损失惨重
    新华社日内瓦10月13日电  据联合国非洲经济委员会今天发表的一份研究报告估计，从1980至1988年，南非对邻国的军事侵略使这些国家的经济损失达600亿美元，并造成150万人死亡。
    报告指出，南非种族政权奉行的军事侵略在邻国制造动乱的政策是造成这些国家经济衰退的主要原因。如果没有南非的军事侵略，1988年这一些国家的生产可能大幅度增长。
    连年不断的战争已使75万不满5岁的儿童丧生，150万人背井离乡，沦为难民，还有大约600万人流离失所。
    报告强调，南非当局不断对邻国发动军事侵略其根本目的是企图继续维持前线国家对它的经济依赖，从而继续从政治上奴役这些国家。
