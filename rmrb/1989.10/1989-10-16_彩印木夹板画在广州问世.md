Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 15th.

Guangzhou's Tianhe Special Crafts Factory has recently launched a new product—color-printed wooden panel paintings. This is another innovation in China's printing technology.

The technology for color-printed wooden panel paintings solves a series of specialized technical problems in directly printing any photographic or painted images onto wooden panels using modern offset printing technology. It also utilizes the natural grain of the wooden panels and the most advanced surface treatment methods for wooden panels to create vibrant, elegant, and fresh color-printed wooden panel paintings. These paintings are rich in layers, have a strong sense of depth, and under natural light, the images appear delicate and raised, with a texture that is either wooden or plastic, exuding a natural and rustic charm. They can withstand water, weak acids, alkalis, gasoline, and detergent scrubbing, as well as prolonged exposure to sunlight, ensuring that the colors do not fade over time.

Currently, the factory's wooden panel paintings have been released to the market. The products are suitable for decorating hotels, office buildings, and residential spaces.

    彩印木夹板画在广州问世
    新华社广州10月15日电　（记者廖勇民）广州市天河特种工艺厂最近推出一种新产品——彩印木夹板画。这是我国印刷技术的又一发明。
    彩印木夹板画技术，解决了用现代胶印技术直接将任何摄影、绘画等图案印刷在木夹板上的一系列特种技术问题，并利用木夹板表面天然纹理和目前最先进的木夹板表面上光处理方法，制造出绚丽多姿、高雅清新的彩印木夹板画。这种木夹板画层次丰富，立体感强，在自然光线下，画面玲珑浮凸，质感或木或塑，极具返朴归真的自然风格，并能经受水、弱酸、碱以及汽油、洗涤剂的擦洗，耐日光照射，经久不退色。
    目前，这家工厂的木夹板画已投放市场，产品种类适用于宾馆、办公楼等公共场所及家庭居室的装饰。
