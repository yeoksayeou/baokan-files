Title: Li Dazhao

A mountain range of light
Rises in the shadow of the cold night
Its mineral deposits and depth are immeasurable
Its heat source and range are inexhaustible

Your forehead unfolds the vast land of China
An endless expanse of plains
Your pen, sharp and piercing,
Opens the jaws of hell

With fiery steps,
You march from the north to the south,
Blowing a horn taken from a foreign land,
Repeatedly sounding the call.

Inspired by the heat,
A faint wish no longer wanders in the mire,
Rough stones, once hammered,
Suddenly sparkle with fire.

Scattered stones gather together,
Raising more mountain ranges,
Each stone is hot and burning,
Each wish turns into a pearl.

It is time to sing and dance wildly,
You speak to us with your eyes,
The road stretches to the horizon,
Everywhere, your stern gaze commands.

Li Dazhao Statue
The statue is made of light red granite, standing five meters high and seven meters wide, located in the Dazhao Park in Tangshan City.

专栏：

　　李大钊
　　卢祖品
　　一条光明的山脉
　　在寒夜的阴影中隆起
　　说不清矿藏蕴积的厚度
　　探不尽热源辐射的范围
　　你的前额展开中华大地
　　一望无际的原野
　　手中锋利的笔
　　撑开地狱的双颚
　　你以焰火的脚步
　　从北方走到南方
　　频频吹响一只
　　刚刚取自异国的号角
    缘于热力的鼓舞　微弱的愿望
    不再彳亍于污浊的泥淖
    粗砺的石头一经锻打
    骤然火星四溅
    分散的集合起来
    从此隆起更多的山脉
    每一块石头都滚烫滚烫
    每一个愿望都变成珍珠
    又该是狂歌起舞的时间
    你用眼睛同我们说话
    道路向天边延伸
    到处有你威严的逼视（附图片）
　　李大钊像
