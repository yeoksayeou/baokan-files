Recently, many model workers and advanced individuals have been featured in the media for their self-reliance and hard work in entrepreneurship. Their practices have promoted revolutionary heroism, earning them respect. National Labor Model Worker, Li Shuangliang from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, is one such inspiring figure.

Li Shuangliang and his colleagues have worked tirelessly for over six years, removing a mountain of slag and recycling tens of millions of tons of various scrap metals, saving and creating value worth over a billion yuan. He said, "Reform is not about who has the biggest 'hand' or who is the most fashionable; reform is about entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurship requires hard work and perseverance."

The spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and dedication is a crucial guarantee for the success of socialist revolution and construction. Today, this spirit is more necessary than ever. Some people think that with the development of production and abundance of goods, they can avoid hardships and difficulties. This has led to a trend of extravagance and waste, with some people squandering national property. For example, imported equipment is left exposed to the elements at docks and construction sites, while factories and warehouses are filled with substandard products and damaged raw materials. Additionally, due to negligence in packaging exported goods, billions of dollars in foreign exchange are lost annually. Such actions cause severe losses to the country and its people. The facts show that the revolutionary spirit exemplified by model figures like Meng Tai, Jiao Yulu, Wang Jianxin, and Li Shuangliang is not outdated in the era of reform and opening up; instead, it should be further promoted.

"Measure and economize, save money, and prohibit extravagance, for these are urgent needs of the country," as the ancients said. Today, to raise the living standards of our developing country to a modestly prosperous level and eventually to the ranks of moderately affluent nations, the task is unprecedentedly arduous. History dictates that we must continue to promote the spirit of self-reliance and hard work. Everyone should practice this spirit, making the Chinese nation more thrifty and enterprising in the practice of socialist construction.

### 改革不是比谁“手大”

　　改革不是比谁“手大”
　　路华
    最近，许多劳模和先进人物自力更生、艰苦创业的事迹不断见诸报端。他们以自己的实践，弘扬了革命英雄主义精神，令人敬佩。全国劳动模范、太原钢铁公司职工李双良，就是其中一个感人的人物。
    李双良和他的伙伴艰苦奋斗6年多，搬去了一座渣山，回收各种废旧金属数十万吨，节约和创造价值上亿元。他说：改革不是比谁“手大”，看谁洋气；改革是创业，创业就得吃苦耐劳。
    自力更生，艰苦奋斗，励精图治的精神，是社会主义革命和建设事业成功的重要保证。今天，这种精神更不能少。有些人以为生产发展了，东西丰富了，滋长了怕苦畏难情绪，甚至大手大脚，铺张浪费之风蔓延，出现了一些糟蹋国家财产的败家子。他们毫不珍惜国家财产，一些进口设备在码头、工地任凭日晒雨淋，工厂仓库里堆满了不合格产品和污损的原材料；还因包装出口货物疏忽大意，一年损失数以亿计美元的外汇，如此等等，给国家和人民带来严重损失。事实说明，孟泰、焦裕禄、王铁人和李双良等先进模范人物身体力行的革命精神，在改革开放中不是过时了，而是应该继续发扬光大。
      “审度量，节衣服，俭财用，禁侈泰，为国之急也”，这是古人的治国富民道理。今天，要把我们这个发展中国家生活提高到小康水平，进而进入中等富裕国家之列，任务之艰巨前所未有。历史决定我们必须继续发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗精神。人人身体力行，使中华民族在社会主义建设的实践中成为更加勤俭、更加进取的民族。
