A coup aimed at overthrowing Panamanian Defense Forces Commander Manuel Noriega lasted only 10 hours before it failed, leaving the Washington authorities "very disappointed." Although the U.S. government denied involvement in the coup, the Panamanian government and public opinion revealed with substantial evidence that U.S. troops stationed in the Canal Zone had directly collaborated with and supported this short-lived coup. Even American newspapers reported that U.S. military officers not only listened to the reports from Panamanian coup plotters but also "jointly studied" the coup plans with them, assuring them that they would receive U.S. military support. However, the U.S. involvement in the Panamanian coup ended up in another embarrassment.

The superpower, the United States, exerted pressure on the small nation of Panama from political, economic, diplomatic, and military angles, all in an attempt to oust Noriega, but failed. Why? Some Latin American affairs experts in Washington attributed this to "lack of intelligence." This is indeed a far-fetched explanation. The U.S. has a vast and advanced electronic eavesdropping network in its Southern Command in Panama, capable of monitoring all telephone conversations in the country. White House spokesman Fitzwater also admitted, "Someone had informed U.S. officials about the impending coup." In fact, the U.S. was not only aware of the coup but also provided support in terms of personnel and equipment. The real reason why the U.S. intervention in the Panamanian coup failed is not due to "lack of intelligence," but because it pursued a policy of hegemony, interfering in Panama's internal affairs, and going against the wishes of the Panamanian people. American Latin American affairs experts avoid this fundamental reason and instead blame the U.S. failure on "lack of intelligence." This is indeed a case of the bull's head not matching the horse's mouth.

    牛头不对马嘴
    一起以推翻巴拿马国防军司令诺列加为目标的兵变只持续了10个小时，便宣告失败，这使华盛顿当局“感到非常沮丧”。尽管美国政府矢口否认它插手这场兵变，但巴拿马政府和舆论却以大量事实揭露，美国驻运河区的部队直接配合和支持了这场短命的兵变。连美国报纸也在报道中透露，美国军官不但听取了巴拿马兵变军官的“报告”，而且还与他们“共同研究了”兵变计划，让他们相信“会得到美国的军事支持”。可是，美国对巴拿马这次兵变的插手，到头来只落得个又一次丢脸。
    堂堂超级大国对弹丸小国巴拿马，从政治、经济、外交、军事等各个方面多管齐下，施加压力，一心要把诺列加拉下马，但始终未能如愿，原因何在？华盛顿某些拉美事务专家竟归因于“情报缺乏”。这实在是太牵强了。美国在巴拿马的南方司令部有个庞大而先进的电子窃听网，可以监听这个国家所有的电话内容。白宫发言人菲茨沃特也承认，“有人已经告诉美国官员将要发动这场政变”。事实上，美国对这次兵变不仅知情，而且在人力和装备上都已给予支持。其实，华盛顿这次插手巴拿马兵变之所以不能得逞，根本原因并非“情报缺乏”，而在于它推行强权政治，干涉巴拿马的内政，违背了巴拿马人民的愿望。美国的拉美事务专家回避这个根本原因，而把美国的败举归咎于“情报缺乏”，这实在是牛头不对马嘴了。·彦忠·
