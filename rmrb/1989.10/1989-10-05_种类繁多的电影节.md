The number of various film festivals held in different countries and regions around the world is increasing. There are more than three hundred well-known international film festivals alone. International film festivals generally include three basic activities: awards, screenings, and market transactions. International film festivals are an important activity for international cultural exchange and friendly relations between countries, and they are also an important market for international film trade.

Comprehensive international film festivals are larger in scale, and films of various types from all over the world can participate in screenings or competitions. The most influential comprehensive international film festival is the Venice International Film Festival. It is also the world's first international film festival, established in 1932, and is known as the "father of international film festivals." The Cannes International Film Festival, Moscow International Film Festival, and Berlin International Film Festival are also large-scale international film festivals.

Regional international film festivals only screen films from certain regions, a few regions, or specific countries. Regional international film festivals that have been held include: the African Film Festival, Asian Film Festival, Afro-Asian Film Festival, ASEAN Film Festival, Balkan Film Festival, and Francophone Film Festival.

Specialized international film festivals are smaller in scale and generally only screen or mainly screen films of a specific professional genre. From the various film festivals held around the world, the types of films cover more than thirty professional fields, truly diverse. For example: Animation Film Festival, Comedy Film Festival, Science Fiction Film Festival, Educational Film Festival, Sports Film Festival, Fairy Tale Film Festival, Nature Film Festival, Educational Film Festival, Tourism Film Festival, Psychological Film Festival, and Science and Technology Film Festival, and so on.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning the "World's Worst Film Festival." This festival was co-founded by Canadian advertising executive Lauren Druvellier and three other Canadians. The first festival was held from October 29 to November 3, 1979, in Ottawa, and has been held annually since, with the location varying each year. The purpose of the "World's Worst Film Festival" is to learn from the worst examples, as the founder put it: "A bad film can teach people more than a good film." The festival rules state that participating films must be considered worthless, absurd, boring, and never sell well in various parts of the world. After the most authoritative film critics watch the films, they vote to select the worst feature film and short film, and award prizes.

China began participating in international film festivals in July 1950, starting with the fifth Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia. The film "Daughters of China" won the "Freedom Struggle Award," "Zhao Yiman" won the "Actor Award," and four out of eleven documentaries won the "Documentary Honor Certificate," with one winning the "Short Film Honor Certificate." Since then, China has selected films to participate in various international film festivals every year. Especially in recent years, with the reform and opening up, Chinese films have participated in more international film festivals. In 1950, China hosted the Beijing People's Democratic Countries Film Week, with nine countries participating. In 1957, the Asian Film Week was held, with sixteen Asian countries and regions participating. In 1987, the Beijing International Film Festival was officially held. Its success was a good beginning.

    种类繁多的电影节
    范中汇
    世界上各个国家和地区举办的各种各样的电影节越来越多。仅知名的国际性电影节就达三百多个。国际电影节一般都包括三项基本活动：评奖、观摩和市场交易。国际电影节是国际文化交流、各国友好往来的重要活动之一，也是国际上电影贸易的重要市场。
    综合性国际电影节规模较大，世界各地的各种类型的影片都可参加放映或评比。世界上影响最大的综合性国际电影节首推威尼斯国际电影节。它也是世界上第一个国际电影节，创办于一九三二年，被誉为“国际电影节之父”。戛纳国际电影节、莫斯科国际电影节、柏林国际电影节，都是规模较大的国际电影节。
    地区性国际电影节，只放映某一地区、几个地区或某些国家的影片。已举办的地区性国际电影节有：非洲电影节、亚洲电影节、亚非电影节、东盟国家电影节、巴尔干国家电影节和法语区国家电影节等。
    专题性国际电影节，规模较小，一般只放映或主要放映某一专业题材的影片。从世界各国已举办的这一类电影节来看，影片种类涉及三十多个专业领域，真可谓形形色色。例如：动画片电影节、喜剧片电影节、科幻片电影节、科教片电影节、体育片电影节、童话片电影节、大自然电影节、教育电影节、旅游电影节、心理片电影节和科技电影节等等。
    此外，值得一提的还有世界最差影片电影节。该电影节为加拿大首都渥太华的广告商劳伦·德鲁维莉小姐和另外三位加拿大人共同创办。第一届于一九七九年十月二十九日至十一月三日在渥太华举行，以后每年举行一次，地点不固定。举办最差影片电影节的宗旨是为了从最坏的典型中吸取教训，用创办人的话来说就是：
  “一部坏影片比一部好影片能使人们学到更多的东西。”电影节章程规定：参加的影片必须是在世界各地被认为是毫无价值、荒谬绝伦、枯燥无味、永远不卖座的影片。由最有权威的电影评论家看完影片后进行评论，投票选出最差的故事片和短片，并给予奖励。
    我国从一九五○年七月参加捷克斯洛伐克第五届卡罗发维利国际电影节（故事片《中华女儿》获“自由斗争奖”，《赵一曼》获“演员奖”，十一部纪录片中四部获“纪录片荣誉奖状”，一部获“短片荣誉奖状”）开始，历年都选片参加若干国际电影节。特别是近年来随着改革开放，我国影片参加的国际电影节越来越多。一九五○年我国曾举办过北京人民民主国家电影周，有九个国家参加。一九五七年又举办过亚洲电影周，有十六个亚洲国家和地区参加。一九八七年，又正式举办了北京国际电影节。它的成功是一个良好的开端。
