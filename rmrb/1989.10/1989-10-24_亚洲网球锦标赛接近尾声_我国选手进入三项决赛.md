The Asian Tennis Championships are nearing their end. Today, to compete for the four final spots, players battled from morning until night before the results were clear. Chinese athletes Zhang Jiuhua, Li Fang, and Xia Jiaping, Zhang Jiuhua have entered the finals for men's singles, women's singles, and men's doubles. Our mixed doubles players have been eliminated.

The second-place winner of the second National Youth Games, 16-year-old Li Fang, performed exceptionally well. In her match against South Korean player Kim Ilsun, she was brave and clever, daring to go to the net, hitting the ball far, and with a wide angle, making her opponent run tirelessly and lose the ability to counterattack. She first won the first set 6:0, then won the second set 6:1, defeating the strong opponent who had been on a winning streak with a 2:0 score. Experts believe that Li Fang has good physical and mental qualities and is a very promising athlete. Tomorrow, she will face Wang Siting from the Chinese Taipei team. Wang Siting is a skilled player with rich competition experience and was once called the "Queen of Asian Tennis," making her a formidable opponent. For the young player Li Fang, tomorrow will be a tough battle.

China's mixed doubles players all lost to foreign players, showing monotonous techniques and not playing intelligently in the fight for the final spot. In the future, they need to strengthen their skills significantly.

Tomorrow's men's singles and men's doubles finals will be a severe test for Chinese players. According to experts, the men's doubles will be more difficult, as South Korea's Kim Jae-deok and Bae Nam-ju are a tough pair to beat, with superb skills. The men's singles opponent is also South Korea's Kim Jae-deok. He is fierce on the court, has a variety of shots, and strong adaptability, but since he will also participate in the men's doubles final tomorrow, he will have a lot of mental pressure. If our players can seize his weaknesses, there is a chance of victory.

　　亚洲网球锦标赛接近尾声
　　我国选手进入三项决赛
    本报北京10月23日讯　记者黄振中报道：亚洲网球锦标赛接近尾声。今天，为争夺4个单项决赛权，选手们从上午苦战到天黑才见分晓。中国选手张九华、李芳和夏加平、张九华进入男单、女单和男双3个单项决赛，我混双选手被淘汰。
    第二届全国青运会女单冠军、16岁的李芳表现出色。她在同南朝鲜选手金一顺交锋时勇敢机智，敢于上网，球拉得开，角度大，使对手疲于奔跑，失去反击之力。她先以6∶0拿下第一盘，接着以6∶1拿下第二盘，以2∶0的比分战胜了一路顺风的强手。行家认为，李芳的身体素质和心理素质都不错，是个很有前途的运动员。明天她将迎战中国台北队名将王思婷。王思婷球艺高，有丰富的比赛经验，曾被称为亚洲“网球皇后”，是一个很难对付的选手。对于小将李芳来说，明天将是一场恶战。
    中国的混双选手都败在海外选手的拍下，在争夺决赛权时技术单调，打得也不聪明，今后需要大力加强。
    明天的男单和男双决赛，对中国选手是严峻的考验。据行家分析，男双更难打，南朝鲜的金载堤和裴南主是一块难啃的骨头，技艺高超。男单的对手也是南朝鲜的金载堤。他场上表现凶狠，球路多，应变能力强，但由于明天要参加男双决赛，精神压力大，如我选手能抓住其弱点，有取胜的希望。
