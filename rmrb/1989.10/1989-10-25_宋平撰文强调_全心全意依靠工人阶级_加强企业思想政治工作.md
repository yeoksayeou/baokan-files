    The forthcoming issue of the 11th period of the journal *Research on Ideological and Political Work* will publish an article by Song Ping, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, titled *Strengthening Enterprise Ideological and Political Work by Wholeheartedly Relying on the Working Class*.

    In this article, Song Ping points out that our Party has always attached great importance to ideological and political work, which is the lifeline of all our work and a precious legacy. However, in recent years, ideological and political work has been seriously weakened, and this should be given sufficient attention. Song Ping says that, comparatively speaking, ideological and political work in enterprises, especially in large and medium-sized key enterprises, has been done relatively well. The tradition of the Party's ideological and political work has not been broken, and the ideological and political work teams have not been dispersed. Under the conditions of reform and opening up, they have explored and created some new experiences. However, it is also necessary to see that the ideological and political work in enterprises has also been weakened to a considerable extent. Under new conditions, and after the Central Committee has once again emphasized strengthening ideological and political work, it is possible and necessary to truly strengthen it on a new basis and do it better.

    Song Ping emphasizes that wholeheartedly relying on the working class is an important guiding ideology of our Party. To do a good job in enterprise ideological and political work, one must grasp this central idea. He says, how to further establish the idea of the working class as an advanced and leading class among the broad masses of workers, and how to fully mobilize everyone's enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity in building socialism, is a problem that enterprise ideological and political workers must work hard to solve. Through painstaking and meticulous work, workers should be educated in communist ideals and patriotism and collectivism. Currently, the focus of ideological and political work should be on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and criticizing bourgeois liberalization, with other aspects of education revolving around this focus.

    Song Ping says that to strengthen ideological and political work, the first step is to build a strong Party. In enterprises, it is necessary to build strong primary Party organizations. A strong Party and healthy primary organizations provide a foundation for work. This is the key to strengthening enterprise ideological and political work. He reaffirms that in enterprises, both the factory director responsibility system and the role of the Party committee should be implemented. Both the factory director and the Party secretary should have a comprehensive view, work together, support each other, and consult with each other. Strengthening the construction of both material and spiritual civilization in enterprises is a common task for both the enterprise administration and the Party committee, and they must cooperate with each other to run the enterprise well. This is our common goal.

### 宋平撰文强调  全心全意依靠工人阶级  加强企业思想政治工作

　　宋平撰文强调
　　全心全意依靠工人阶级
　　加强企业思想政治工作
    新华社北京10月24日电　即将出版的《思想政治工作研究》杂志第11期发表了中共中央政治局常委宋平的文章：《围绕全心全意依靠工人阶级
  切实加强企业思想政治工作》。
    宋平在这篇文章中指出，我们党历来重视思想政治工作，它是我们一切工作的生命线，是传家宝。但是，近几年思想政治工作受到严重的削弱，对此应有足够的估计。宋平说，比较起来，企业的思想政治工作特别是大中型骨干企业的思想政治工作，做得好一些。党的思想政治工作的传统没有断，思想政治工作队伍没有散，在改革开放的条件下探索创造了一些新鲜经验。但是，也不能不看到，企业的思想政治工作也在相当程度上被削弱了。在新的条件下，在中央重新强调加强思想政治工作以后，应该而且有可能在新的基础上真正加强起来，并且搞得更好。
    宋平强调，全心全意依靠工人阶级，是我们党的一个重要的指导思想，要做好企业思想政治工作就需要把握住这个中心思想。他说，如何在广大职工中把工人阶级作为一个先进阶级、领导阶级的主人翁思想进一步树立起来，把大家建设社会主义的积极性、主动性和创造性充分调动起来，这是企业思想政治工作者要下功夫解决的一个问题。要通过艰苦细致的工作，对职工进行共产主义理想的教育和爱国主义、集体主义的教育。当前要把坚持四项基本原则、批判资产阶级自由化的教育，作为思想政治工作的重点，其他方面的教育要围绕这个重点来进行。
    宋平说，加强思想政治工作，首先要把党建设好，在企业要把基层党组织建设好。把党建设好了，基层组织健全了，有个载体，才有人抓工作。这是加强企业思想政治工作的关键。他重申，在企业中既要坚持执行厂长负责制，又要加强党委的作用。厂长和党委书记都要胸怀全局，同心协力，互相支持，互相商量。加强企业的两个文明建设，是企业行政和党委的共同任务，一定要相互配合，把企业办好。这就是我们共同的目的。
