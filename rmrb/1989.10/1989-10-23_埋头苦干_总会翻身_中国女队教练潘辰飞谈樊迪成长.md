After Fan Di won the world championship, the reporter found the coach of the Chinese women's team, Pan Chenfei, to ask about the secret to success. He thought for a moment and said, "This is a victory of the spirit of collectivism."

He said that behind Fan Di's world championship title is the hard work of the entire team's coaches. This year, the coaching team has strengthened unity, not caring about personal gains and losses, and the cooperation has been getting better. When there are problems in training, they pool their wisdom to study them. In July of this year, Fan Di was handed over to Pan Chenfei for guidance. He and the original coach jointly studied the training, including adjusting Fan Di's temperament and habits, etc. Pan Chenfei told the reporter that the changes in the Chinese team have even caught the attention of the Soviet team. Coach Pan said that in the team competition, the compulsory exercises for women's events were all successful, and we were far ahead of many other teams, attracting the attention of judges from various countries, who generally believe that our understanding of the requirements for the movements is correct.

Pan Chenfei said that in recent years, women's gymnastics has been in a low ebb, "We just think, work hard, and there will be a day to turn things around!" Coach Pan entrusted the reporter to convey to the broad readers, hoping that everyone will understand gymnastics, cherish gymnastics, and support gymnastics. When winning, don't boast too much, because achievements cannot always rise in a straight line; when failing, it is not entirely useless, don't abandon it. We are still one level lower in terms of strength in optional movements, lacking difficult and new movements. In order to advance to the 1992 Olympics, we still need to carry forward the spirit of collectivism, select talents, and strive hard.

　　埋头苦干　总会翻身
　　——中国女队教练潘辰飞谈樊迪成长
    樊迪获得世界冠军后，记者找到中国女队教练潘辰飞，向他请教成功的秘诀。他沉思了一下，说道：“这是集体主义精神的胜利。”
    他说，樊迪的世界冠军称号背后凝聚着全队教练的心血。今年以来，教练队伍加强团结，不计较个人得失，配合越来越好。训练中有了问题，群策群力来研究。今年7月，樊迪才交给潘辰飞指导。他同原先的教练共同研究训练，包括调理樊迪的脾气和习性等等。潘辰飞对记者说，中国队的变化连苏联队都注意到了。潘教练说，团体赛规定动作女子项目我们全部成功，而且高出很多队一格，吸引了各国裁判的注意，普遍认为我们对动作要求的理解正确。
    潘辰飞说，这几年，女子体操在低谷徘徊，“我们就是想，埋头苦干，总有翻身的日子！”
    潘教练委托记者转告广大读者，希望大家理解体操，爱护体操，支持体操。胜了不要吹得过高，因为成绩不能总直线上升；失败的时候也不是一无是处，不要冷落它。我们在自选动作方面实力还低一格，缺少难、新动作。为了向1992年的奥运会挺进，我们还得发扬集体主义精神，选拔人才，艰苦奋斗。
