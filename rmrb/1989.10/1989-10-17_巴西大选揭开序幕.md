The curtain has risen on Brazil's general election, which is scheduled for November 15 this year. On that day, over 82 million voters nationwide will directly elect a new president, marking a transitional phase in Brazil's "democratization process." This is the first time in over 20 years that Brazil has resumed direct national elections, making it a significant event on the country's political stage.

Brazil's general election preparations began early this year, and the atmosphere is now heated with campaign activities. In the capital, Brasília, as well as in major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, election slogans and advertisements are plastered everywhere. Loudspeakers on campaign vehicles blare election slogans and music day and night. Candidates and their campaign teams are crisscrossing the country, promoting their election platforms and governance plans, expanding their influence, and seeking votes. Major newspapers, radio stations, and television channels report extensively on election-related news daily. Television stations also broadcast live candidate appearances, policy speeches, or debates with their rivals during prime-time slots. The Brazilian Federal Supreme Electoral Court has published the election procedures and timeline, and is arranging preparations for transportation, communication, and vote counting on election day. The question of who will be the next president has become the primary topic of conversation among Brazilians.

A notable feature of this year's election is the large number of candidates and the intense competition. According to the Supreme Electoral Court, by the registration deadline of August 31, there were 34 parties and candidates, of which 22 were deemed eligible to run. In addition to the presidential candidates, each party has nominated a vice-presidential candidate. Such a large number of parties participating in the presidential race is rare in Brazil's history, making it difficult for the election authorities to design and print ballots and for television stations to schedule election-related programs.

Due to the large number of candidates, the election campaign is complex, and voters' attention is somewhat scattered, with many undecided on whom to vote for. According to several polling agencies, about 40% of voters have not yet decided on their candidate. Among those who have, no candidate has reached 50% of the votes. According to Brazilian election law, if no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, a runoff election will be held between the top two candidates.

Another characteristic of this election process is the emergence of young parties and candidates. Multiple opinion polls have shown that the candidate of the ruling Democratic Movement Party, Ulisses Guimarães, has fluctuated around 5% in voter intentions. Candidates from major opposition parties, such as Leonel Brizola of the Democratic Labour Party, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party, Aureliano Chaves of the Liberal Party, Marco Maciel of the Social Democratic Party, and Roberto Cavalcanti of the Social Christian Party, have all received less than 15% of voter intentions. The only exception is Fernando Collor de Mello of the newly formed National Reconstruction Party, whose voter intentions peaked at 42%, consistently leading the race.

Collor's rise has shaken the Brazilian political scene, surprising many. At just 40 years old, he is the youngest among all presidential candidates and has previously served as the governor of the northeastern state of Alagoas. Despite his relatively shallow experience, he has garnered significant support from voters. There are various analyses and comments on his rise. A common view is that Collor has won the hearts of the people by proposing a set of policies that transcend other parties, advocating for a "non-partisan government," comprehensive political reforms, economic restructuring, and the establishment of new social ethics, which resonate with the Brazilian people. Others say that Collor's youth and fresh approach are his greatest assets.

However, people have also noticed that with nearly half of the voters still undecided, the situation could change. Collor's lead is not entirely secure, especially since his voter intentions have dropped by 10% since October, while candidates from the Liberal Party, Democratic Labour Party, and others have seen their votes gradually increase. Some political analysts even predict that in the final month of the campaign, Collor and several other party candidates will have similar vote shares. Therefore, until the last moment, the outcome remains uncertain, and it is still too early to conclude who will be the next president.

    巴西大选揭开序幕
    本报记者　兰才基
    巴西大选将于今年11月15日举行，届时全国8200多万选民用直接投票的方式选举新总统，完成“民主化进程”的过渡阶段。这是巴西在中断了20多年之后重新恢复起来的全民直接选举，因此成为这个国家政治舞台中的一件大事。
    巴西这次大选，从今年年初就开始准备，目前已呈现一派竞选的热烈气氛。在首都巴西利亚，以及圣保罗、里约热内卢等大城市，街头巷尾贴满了竞选的标语和广告，宣传车上的高音喇叭连日发出震耳欲聋的竞选口号声和乐曲声。各党派的总统候选人和他们的竞选班子，正在穿梭游说于全国各地，宣扬自己的竞选纲领和治国计划，扩大声势和影响，争取选票。全国各大报纸、电台和电视台每天都大量报道有关大选的消息，电视台还利用每天中午和晚间的“黄金时刻”统一播出候选人“亮相”、发表施政演说或与他们竞争对手公开辩论的实况。巴西联邦最高选举法院也已经把大选规程和时间表公诸于众，着手安排大选日子里的交通、通讯联络和开票统计等准备工作。谁当下届总统？眼下已经成为巴西人街谈巷议的主要话题。
    参加总统竞选的人数众多，竞争异常激烈，这是巴西今年大选的一个特色。据最高选举法院宣布，迄8月31日竞选登记日期，参选的政党及其候选人共有34个，经过审查具有合法竞选资格的为22个，除总统候选人以外，各政党还推举了各自的副总统人选一名。如此众多的政党参加总统角逐，这在巴西历史上实属罕见，以致使选举法院在设计排印选票和电视台安排竞选专题节目时间都感到困难。
    由于参加总统角逐的人数众多，竞选运动显得纷繁复杂，选民的注意力也比较分散，许多人在投票问题上举棋不定。根据几家民意调查机构所作的统计，到目前为止，尚有40％左右的选民还没有最后确定投谁的票。从已经确定投票对象的“意向选票”来看，至今还没有一个政党的候选人得票达到50％。按照巴西选举法规定，如果总统候选人的选票均达不到50％以上的过半数，那就将在得票最多的前两名候选人中进行第二轮投票选举。
    巴西这次大选进程的另一个特点是，年轻的政党和候选人崭露头角。从多次举行的民意测验显示，执政的民运党候选人乌利塞斯·吉马良斯的“意向选票”在5％上下浮动；在野的几个大党，如民主工党候选人布里佐拉、巴西工党候选人卢拉、自由党候选人阿弗夫、民社党候选人马卢夫以及社民党候选人科瓦斯等，“意向选票”都未超过15％；唯独在今年年初组建的新党——国家重建党候选人科洛尔·德梅洛的“意向选票”最高曾达到42％，一直处于遥遥领先的地位。
    科洛尔的崛起震动了巴西政坛，使许多人感到“意外”。这位总统候选人刚满40岁，是所有参加总统角逐者中最年轻的一位，他曾担任过东北部阿拉戈亚斯州州长，尽管资历和根底比较浅薄，但却受到不少选民的拥戴。对于他的崛起，巴西人有着各种各样的分析和评论。比较普遍的看法是，科洛尔能赢得民心，主要在于他提出了一套超越其他政党的施政纲领，主张建立一个“超党派的政府”，在政治上进行“全盘革新”，“重整国家经济”，树立新的社会公德等，这些口号比较符合巴西人的心态。也有人说，科洛尔“年轻有为，新人新风尚是他竞选的最大资本”。
    但是，人们也注意到，由于近半数的选民还没有确定投票对象，局势还可能起变化，科洛尔的优势地位也并不十分稳定，特别是在10月份以来他获得的“意向选票”下降了10％，自由党、民主工党等候选人得票趋向在逐步上升。一些政治分析家甚至预言，在竞选运动的最后一个月内，科洛尔和其他几个政党候选人的得票趋势将出现并驾齐驱的局面。因此，不到最后关头，胜负仍难意料，究竟谁将出任下届总统，现时还不能作最后结论。
