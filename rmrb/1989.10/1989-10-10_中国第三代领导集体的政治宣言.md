After achieving a decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Chinese Communist Party held a historic and significant Fourteenth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, producing the third-generation leadership collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core.

Where will this leadership collective lead China?

Domestic people and international friends are eagerly looking forward to it, full of eager anticipation, carefully observing its movements.

At this time, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, delivered a lengthy speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of New China.

This speech, before its release, underwent extensive solicitation of opinions from both inside and outside the Party, and was deeply discussed and revised by thousands of comrades, making it a collective wisdom of the Party and the people.

This speech, undoubtedly, is an important political declaration to the country and the world after experiencing a serious political storm.

From the speech, one can clearly see its firm principles and distinct character:

	• It is based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the principle of combining theory with practice, and insists on taking a path that suits the country's national conditions, answering a series of major theoretical and practical issues that people generally care about in contemporary China's socialist modernization construction and reform and opening-up.
	• It uses the perspective and method of historical materialism and dialectical materialism to analyze history and reality materialistically rather than idealistically, dialectically rather than metaphysically, comprehensively rather than partially, summarizing both positive and negative experiences, and drawing convincing conclusions, helping people see the direction of progress more clearly.
	• It is full of confidence in the cause of socialism and communism, standing firm against the anti-communist and anti-China currents internationally, solemnly declaring to the world: The Chinese people have never and will never yield to any external pressure, and will not retreat even half a step on the issue of adhering to the principles of socialism.
	• It stands firmly on the belief in the great creative power of the Chinese people, advocating patriotism and the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, while emphasizing the reliance on one's own strength to build a socialist China, solemnly declaring that ancient China will open its doors more bravely and absorb everything beneficial to us from the world with a broader mind, to better and faster advance the modernization construction of our country; ...

This internal and external political declaration is undoubtedly also the current guiding program for the Chinese people to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The whole Party, the whole army, and people of all ethnic groups across the country, with this important speech, unify their thinking and actions, have a common goal, and work together. We will definitely consolidate and develop the victory of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, consolidate and develop the stable and united political situation, and achieve the stable development of the national economy. Our various undertakings will definitely continue to advance along the socialist path. The progress and development of socialist China will definitely not be stopped by any difficulties and will definitely not be shaken or changed by any domestic and foreign hostile forces.

Therefore, we study the speech, the most important thing is: to improve the level of Marxist understanding, enhance the ability to distinguish historical experience and solve practical problems, and better grasp the objective laws of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

	• Historical and practical experience repeatedly tells us that we must prevent "left" while opposing the right, and prevent the right while opposing "left," and must avoid going from one extreme to another. In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have achieved tremendous successes in socialist construction, achieving successes that were impossible under the past system of exploitation. This is the mainstream of New China's history. However, we have also gone through a tortuous path. In the first 30 years, we repeatedly opposed the right, resulting in mainly committing "left" errors. In the past 10 years, we mainly opposed "left," neglecting the growth of rightist tendencies, and the bourgeois liberalization trend spread, becoming an important cause of the recent turmoil and rebellion. The lesson is profound. Linked to the revolutionary war period, we initially mainly committed rightist errors, and then committed serious "left" errors. It was not until the convening of the Zunyi Conference and the Seventh National Congress of the Party that, with the valuable experience of overcoming both rightist and "leftist" tendencies, we gradually opened up the correct path leading the Chinese revolution to victory. Now, we have a more comprehensive experience and a more mature understanding of building socialism. As long as we adhere to the correct stance, viewpoint, and method of historical materialism and dialectical materialism, and always pay attention to one tendency covering another, we will definitely open up the correct path to achieve greater victories in the socialist cause.

	• From beginning to end, we must closely and organically unite the adherence to the four cardinal principles with the adherence to reform and opening up, and never forget to clearly draw the boundary between the two diametrically opposed reform and opening-up ideas. This is not only of extreme importance for promoting the irreversible reform and opening-up tide in our country to move forward, but also has a real and far-reaching impact on the socialist reform cause in the international arena. If socialism does not carry out reform and opening up, it will inevitably stifle the vitality and dynamism of socialism, will not further liberate productive forces, will not demonstrate the superiority and attractiveness of socialism, and will not ultimately achieve the consolidation, development, and perfection of socialism. If reform and opening up do not take the socialist road, people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the Communist Party, and the guidance of Marxism as the premise and foundation, this reform and opening up will inevitably lead to capitalism, lead to the socialist people's republic becoming a bourgeois republic, and lead to the working people becoming slaves of international monopoly capital and domestic exploiting classes again. International reactionary forces and domestic hostile elements, in collusion with each other, have precisely placed their hopes on this point. The recent turmoil and rebellion in our country and the current reversals in the international communist movement have fully proven this. All those who are loyal to socialism must be vigilant from this and draw profound lessons from the test of blood and fire.

	• We must, from the height of the life and death of the Party and the state, fully recognize that the opposition between the four cardinal principles and bourgeois liberalization will long exist in the socialist stage of our country, especially in its primary stage, and thus more consciously, consistently, and unremittingly carry out the education and struggle against liberalization. Adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing liberalization are two aspects of one thing. Abandoning the four cardinal principles, the Communist Party and the socialist state will change in nature and head towards the abyss of self-destruction. Without opposing liberalization, the four cardinal principles cannot be adhered to. The previous two general secretaries of our Party did not consistently, resolutely, and effectively adhere to the four cardinal principles, and tolerated and supported liberalization, allowing this trend to grow, spread, and flood. This is the main domestic cause of the recent turmoil and rebellion. People have increasingly deepened their understanding and personal experience of this. However, after stopping the turmoil and suppressing the rebellion, has the soil and conditions for the growth of liberalization been completely eliminated? Of course not. Before the superiority and attractiveness of socialism are fully demonstrated, the liberalization trend will always have its market. On this point, we must not relax our vigilance. To carry out the education and struggle against liberalization for a long time, first, we must not be a passing fad, not tight one moment and loose the next, not hard one moment and soft the next, otherwise, we will repeat the past mistakes; second, we must not simplify or exaggerate, not confuse political issues with academic issues, and not continue to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," otherwise, we will become overly sensitive, making it difficult to achieve the expected results and even leading to a serious counterproductive effect, and even leading back to a rigid situation that is extremely unfavorable for the vigorous development of the socialist cause; third, we must stand on the basis of fully mobilizing the initiative and enthusiasm of the broad masses of intellectuals, and never consciously or unconsciously regard intellectuals as the object of opposing liberalization. Only by making them fully realize that opposing liberalization is in the fundamental interests of all the people, including intellectuals, and consciously undertaking this historical mission, can we truly carry out the education and struggle against bourgeois liberalization and see it through to the end, without giving up halfway.

	• On the premise of fully affirming that peace and development are the two major themes of the contemporary world, and on the premise of always adhering to the socialist road and taking economic construction as the center, we must not forget that the international monopoly bourgeoisie has not given up its intention to destroy us, and we must not forget that class struggle will still exist in a certain range in our socialist society for a long time. Currently, generally speaking, the international situation is shifting from tension to relaxation, from confrontation to dialogue. Through the joint efforts of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, a world war may be avoided, and lasting world peace may be maintained. Our socialist modernization construction may be able to obtain a relatively long period of international peace environment. This overall situation and trend of the international situation have not changed due to the turmoil and rebellion in our country and the anti-communist and anti-China waves stirred up by international reactionary forces. However, the world is still far from peaceful, and there are still many contradictions and struggles. Among these many contradictions and struggles, the attempt by the imperialist world of the West to implement "peaceful evolution" on socialist countries, to wage a "smokeless" and "bloodless" war aimed at eliminating socialism, to recapture the positions already occupied by socialism, and to bring them back into the international capitalist system is an important aspect. Western reactionary forces have never given up their fundamental stance of hostility and subversion against the socialist system. And in the socialist stage of our country, especially in its primary stage, there are still forces and elements that are hostile to socialism, and there are still various anti-socialist elements. Class struggle not only exists in a certain range but may also develop to a fairly intense degree under certain conditions. Domestic hostile forces and anti-socialist elements will always seek support and reliance from foreign reactionary forces, and international reactionary forces will find their basis for implementing the "peaceful evolution" strategy against socialism here. This situation has been fully exposed in the recent turmoil and rebellion in our country. For a period of time, we rarely talked about, or even did not talk about at all, the viewpoint and method of class struggle and class analysis, and did not emphasize, or even did not emphasize at all, the use of such viewpoints and methods to observe international and domestic issues (here we are referring to the aspects that should be talked about but are not talked about, and should be used but are not used, and we are certainly not advocating blindly talking and blindly using, and returning to the erroneous line of "taking class struggle as the key link" again). Therefore, we have not been able to prevent the occurrence and development of turmoil and rebellion, isn't this another profound lesson!

	• To build our country into a highly democratic socialist power is a goal and task that we should strive for long-term, and it is an important condition and an essential part of realizing socialist modernization. Without democracy, there is no socialism. As the vanguard organization of the working class that takes the liberation of all mankind as its mission, and as the Communist Party that faithfully represents the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups, there is absolutely no basis or reason to reject or fear democracy. Democracy is an important heritage of human progress with continuity. Therefore, in the process of building socialist democratic politics, it is completely possible and should borrow some democratic practices, forms, and specific institutions produced under the capitalist system, but we must not copy the set of things connected with the essential characteristics of capitalism. This is because socialist democracy, which embodies the power and democratic rights of the broad masses of people, and capitalist democracy, which aims to maintain the rule of the bourgeoisie, have an unmistakable principle difference. We must draw a clear line between the two in essence. Some people advocate so-called "elite" politics, advocate political pluralism and multi-party rotation in power, the essence of which is to exclude the broad masses of laboring people from enjoying democratic rights, negate and cancel the leading position of the Communist Party, which is a great destruction of socialist democracy and is something we absolutely cannot allow. Socialist democracy is also absolutely incompatible with extremist democracy and anarchism. If extremist democracy and anarchism prevail, as has already appeared during the "Cultural Revolution" and this period of turmoil and rebellion, the result can only be a complete violation of the Constitution and laws, a serious destruction of the legal system, and the disappearance of all true democratic order and system, bringing great disasters to the people. In short, our socialist democratic construction must start from the national conditions of our country, carry out it under the leadership of the Party in a planned and step-by-step manner, and combine it well with the strengthening of socialist legal system construction, so as to truly benefit the people and truly be beneficial to the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

	• Adhering to the simultaneous development of material civilization and spiritual civilization, and grasping both hands, is the essential requirement of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and is also a basic strategic policy for realizing socialist modernization. Resolutely overcoming the tendency of only emphasizing material civilization construction and neglecting spiritual civilization construction, and only having a hard front hand and a soft back hand in a period of time, is not only an urgent task at present but also a major issue that needs long-term attention. Socialist society should have a high degree of spiritual civilization, which is a very important basic characteristic of socialist society. Of course, without the fundamental task of developing productive forces, without taking economic construction as the center, and without the improvement of the level of material production, it is wrong to talk about spiritual civilization construction. However, if one thinks that spiritual civilization construction will naturally go up with the development of production and the improvement of material living standards, this is also wrong. What should be particularly noted is that only focusing on material civilization construction, only paying attention to the development of production, and seriously neglecting spiritual civilization construction, neglecting the cultivation and fostering of socialist new people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline, not only makes it difficult to obtain the powerful spiritual force to promote the development of social productive forces, but also makes socialist society have the danger of developing in a deformed way, and even the danger of degenerating and changing in nature. Generally speaking, the spiritual civilization construction of socialism includes education, science, culture construction, and political, ideological, and moral construction guided by Marxism. Any civilized country and society need the development of education, science, and culture, and socialist countries and societies especially need to expand the scale of development in this area and accelerate the speed of development in this area, and quickly change the backward state in this area. While the political, ideological, and moral construction guided by Marxism directly influences and determines the development direction of socialist society, it cannot be neglected in any way. In recent years, due to the relaxation and weakening of socialist spiritual civilization construction, many ugly phenomena that had long disappeared in New China have resurfaced, directly or indirectly affecting the occurrence and development of many rampant and lawless behaviors during the period of turmoil and rebellion, which is also a bitter pill we have to swallow from this.

	• Restoring, developing, and in a certain sense rebuilding the flesh-and-blood connection between the Party and the people, resolutely overcoming various corrupt phenomena of serious alienation from the masses, greatly enhancing the Party's cohesion, attraction, and appeal among the broad masses of the people, is a major issue related to the life and death of the Party, and is also the fundamental guarantee for the continuous victory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our Party was born, developed, and grew stronger in the struggle of the masses. Without the support of the masses, the Party cannot survive for a day. For this truth, in the minds of many comrades, it has regrettably become more and more faint over a period of time. Since the Party took power, some phenomena of bureaucracy, commandism, and corruption and degeneration that alienate the masses have grown. Especially in recent years, due to the weakening of Party building, the weakening of ideological and political work, and the weakening of the leading role of the Party, the problems existing in the Party in political, ideological, organizational, and work style have become more serious. Of course, the severe test of this turmoil and rebellion has proven that our Party is generally good and strong. A few conspirators, under the guise of anti-corruption, attempted to overthrow the Communist Party and subvert the socialist system, which the broad masses will not allow, and their counter-revolutionary conspiracy will never succeed. However, if the Party does not punish and resolutely overcome the corrupt phenomena that indeed exist within itself, and let them develop, it will head towards self-destruction, which is the most dangerous. In the turmoil and rebellion, so many people were involved, causing great disasters and heavy losses, and the masses' dissatisfaction with corrupt phenomena was undoubtedly an important reason. It is precisely based on such reflection and drawing profound lessons from it that the Party, since the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, has, on the one hand, emphasized starting from the leadership to set an example and, on the other hand, emphasized focusing on practical work and not just talking, and has more resolutely and unremittingly carried out the work of punishing corruption and promoting clean governance, and has already begun to achieve results. The people welcome and support this. On the one hand, we hope that all levels of Party organizations, especially the leading organs, will persevere and see it through to the end, without being soft; on the other hand, we, the broad masses of the people, should, starting from loving our Party and government, actively report and strengthen supervision, help the Party and government punish corruption, and truly achieve integrity and clean governance, and better serve the people, and be heart to heart with the people. In this way, our Party will definitely be able to better lead the people to complete the grand cause of realizing socialist modernization.

Jiang Zemin comrade solemnly declared at the end of his National Day speech:

	“History has proven and will continue to prove that the socialist system has strong historical vitality and vigor. The substitution of socialism for capitalism is a true historical trend, and is a decisive stage for mankind to enter the kingdom of freedom from the kingdom of necessity.”
	“We review the past, look to the future, stand on China, and look at the world, and are full of confidence in the socialist cause and full of confidence in the communist future of mankind.”
	This is the truth, and the firm belief of the Chinese people, especially the Communists. We should firmly believe in such truth and firmly establish such belief. In this way, we will not only see the whirlpools and reversals that appear in the development process of socialism but also see the surging of the historical river, and thus avoid short-sightedness in politics; we will definitely be able to greatly enhance the courage and confidence to overcome all difficulties and be unyielding, and firmly advance the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

    中国第三代领导集体的政治宣言
    袁木
    在取得了平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利之后，中国共产党召开的具有重要历史意义的十三届四中全会，产生了以江泽民同志为核心的中国第三代领导集体。
    这个领导集体将把中国引向何方？
    国内人民，国际友人，都对她翘首相望，满怀着殷切的期待，细心地观察着她的动向。
    就在这样的时候，在中华人民共和国成立40周年的前夕，江泽民同志代表中共中央和国务院，发表了庆祝新中国诞生40周年的长篇讲话。
    这篇讲话，发表前经过广泛征求党内外意见，经过几千名同志的深入讨论和参加修改，使它凝聚了党和人民的集体智慧。
    这篇讲话，无疑是在刚刚经历了一场严重的政治风波之后，我国新的领导集体对内对外的一篇重要政治宣言。
    人们从讲话中可以很清楚地看到它坚定的原则立场和鲜明的性格特征：
    ——它根据马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基本原理，遵循理论联系实际的原则，坚持走符合本国国情的自己的路，回答了当代中国社会主义现代化建设和改革开放事业中人们普遍关心的一系列重大理论问题和实际问题；
    ——它运用历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义的观点和方法，唯物地而不是唯心地、辩证地而不是形而上学地、全面地而不是片面地剖析历史和现实，总结了正反两方面的经验，得出了令人信服的结论，使人们进一步看清了前进的方向；
    ——它充满对社会主义、共产主义事业的必胜信念，顶住国际上反共反华的逆流，庄严地昭告天下：中国人民过去从来没有、今后也决不会屈服于任何外来压力，决不会在坚持社会主义原则立场的问题上后退半步；
    ——它立足于充分相信中国人民的创造伟力，弘扬爱国主义和自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，在强调主要依靠自己的力量建设社会主义中国的同时，郑重地宣告了古老的中国将以更勇敢的姿态打开大门，以更博大的胸怀吸收世界上一切对我们有益的东西，以便把我国的现代化建设更好更快地推向前进；……
    这篇对内对外的政治宣言，无疑也是当前指导我国人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的行动纲领。
    全党、全军和全国各族人民，以这篇重要讲话统一认识，统一行动，目标一致，同心协力，我们就一定能够巩固和发展制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的胜利成果，巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，实现国民经济的稳定发展。我们的各项事业，就一定能够沿着社会主义道路继续前进。社会主义中国的进步和发展，就一定是任何困难都阻挡不了的，就一定是任何国内外敌对势力都动摇和改变不了的。
    因此，我们学习讲话，最重要的是：提高马克思主义的认识水平，增强辨别历史经验和解决现实问题的能力，更好地掌握建设有中国特色的社会主义的客观规律。
    ——历史的和现实的经验反复告诉我们，反右必须防“左”，反“左”必须防右，切忌从一个极端走向另一个极端。中华人民共和国成立后的40年，我们取得了社会主义建设的巨大成就，取得了在过去剥削制度下根本不可能取得的成就。这是新中国历史的主流。但是，我们也经历了曲折的道路。前30年不断反右，结果主要犯了“左”的错误。后10年主要反“左”，忽视了右的倾向的滋长，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，成了导致前不久动乱和暴乱发生和发展的一条重要原因。教训是深刻的。联系到革命战争时期，最初主要犯了右的错误，后来又犯了严重的“左”的错误。到了遵义会议的召开，又经过了党的“七大”，由于有了克服右的和“左”的两方面的宝贵经验，这才逐步开拓出引导中国革命走向胜利的正确道路。现在，我们又有了建设社会主义的比较全面的经验和比较成熟的认识，只要我们坚持历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义的正确立场、观点和方法，时刻注意一种倾向掩盖着另一种倾向，就一定能开拓出引导我们夺取社会主义事业更大胜利的正确道路。
    ——自始至终把坚持四项基本原则同坚持改革开放紧密地、有机地统一起来，时刻也不要忘记明确划清两种截然对立的改革开放思路的界限，这不仅对于推动我国已经不可逆转的改革开放潮流向前发展有着极其重要的意义，而且对于国际范围内的社会主义改革事业有着现实的和深远的影响。社会主义如果不进行改革开放，必然将窒息社会主义的生机与活力，不能进一步解放生产力，不能发挥社会主义的优越性和吸引力，不能最终得到社会主义的巩固、发展和完善。改革开放如果不以坚持社会主义道路、坚持人民民主专政、坚持共产党的领导、坚持马克思主义的指导为前提和基础，这种改革开放必然导致于资本主义化，导致于社会主义人民共和国变成资产阶级共和国，导致于劳动人民重新沦为国际垄断资本和国内剥削阶级的双重奴隶。国际反动势力，国内敌对分子，相互勾结，相互联手，恰恰是把他们的希望寄托在这一点上。不久前我国发生的动乱和暴乱，眼下国际共产主义运动中出现的逆流，都充分证明了这一点。一切忠诚于社会主义的人们，都不能不从中提高警惕，从血与火的考验中吸取深刻的教训。
    ——我们一定要从关系党和国家前途命运和生死存亡的高度，充分认识四项基本原则同资产阶级自由化的对立将在我国社会主义阶段特别是它的初级阶段长期存在，从而更加自觉地、始终一贯地、长期不懈地把反对自由化的教育和斗争坚持下去。坚持四项基本原则和反对自由化，是一件事情的两个方面。放弃了四项基本原则，共产党和社会主义国家就会变质，就会走向自我灭亡的深渊。不反对自由化，四项基本原则也就不可能坚持。我们党的前两任总书记坚持四项基本原则不一贯，不坚决，不得力，纵容和支持自由化，使这种思潮滋长、蔓延和泛滥，是前不久发生动乱和暴乱的主要国内根源。对这一点，人们已经有了越来越深切地认识和切身的体验。但是，制止了动乱，平息了暴乱，自由化思潮滋生的土壤和条件是否就完全消除了呢？当然没有。在社会主义优越性和吸引力尚未充分发挥、充分展示之前，自由化思潮总会有它的市场。对这一点，我们也决不能解除思想武装，不能丧失警惕。为了把反对自由化的教育和斗争长期坚持下去，第一不能一阵风，不能紧一阵松一阵，不能硬一阵软一阵，否则就会重蹈过去的覆辙；第二不能简单化、扩大化，不能混淆政治问题和学术问题的界限，不能不继续实行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，否则就会弄得草木皆兵，不仅难以取得预期的效果反而会引起严重的反效应，甚至会重新导向十分不利于社会主义事业蓬勃发展的万马齐喑的僵化局面；第三必须立足于充分发挥广大知识分子的主动性和积极性，绝不能自觉不自觉地把知识分子看成是反对自由化的对象，而只有使他们充分认识到反对自由化是包括知识分子在内的全体人民的根本利益所在，自觉地担负起这项历史使命，才能真正把反对资产阶级自由化的教育和斗争坚持下去，进行到底，而不至于半途而废。
    ——在充分肯定和平与发展是当今世界两大主题的前提下，在始终坚持社会主义必须把发展社会生产力作为根本任务和以经济建设为中心的前提下，决不能忘记国际垄断资产阶级亡我之心不死，不能忘记我国社会在一定范围内还将长期存在阶级斗争。当前，总的来看，国际形势正由紧张趋向缓和，由对抗转向对话。经过世界爱好和平国家和人民的共同努力，世界大战有可能避免，世界持久和平有可能维护。我国的社会主义现代化建设，有可能争取到一个较长时期的国际和平环境。这种国际形势的总格局和总趋势，并没有因为我国发生的动乱、暴乱和国际反动势力掀起的反共反华浪潮而改变。但是，当今的世界还很不太平，还存在着诸多的矛盾和斗争。在诸多的矛盾和斗争中，西方帝国主义世界妄图对社会主义国家实行“和平演变”，打一场以消灭社会主义为目的的“没有硝烟的”“不流血的”战争，夺回社会主义已经占领的阵地，重新使它们纳入国际资本主义的体系，是这诸多矛盾和斗争中的一个重要方面。西方反动势力从来没有放弃过敌视和颠覆社会主义制度的根本立场。而在我国社会主义阶段尤其是它的初级阶段，国内还存在着敌视社会主义的势力和分子，还存在着种种反社会分子，阶级斗争不仅在一定范围内存在，而且在一定条件下还会发展到相当激烈的程度。国内敌对势力和反社会主义分子总是要向国外反动势力寻找支持和依靠，国际反动势力又从这里得到了他们对社会主义实行“和平演变”战略的依据。这种情况，无疑在前不久我国的动乱和暴乱中已充分暴露出来。一个时期以来，我们很少讲甚至根本不讲阶级斗争的观点和阶级分析方法，不强调甚至根本不强调用这样的观点和方法观察国际和国内问题（这里指的当然是应该讲而不讲、应该用而不用的一些方面，决不是主张盲目地胡乱讲和胡乱用，重新又回到“以阶级斗争为纲”的错误路线上去），因而使我们对动乱和暴乱的发生与发展未能很好地防患于未然，这难道还不是又一条很深刻的教训吗！
    ——把我们的国家建设成为高度民主的社会主义强国，是我们应该长期为之奋斗的目标和任务，它是实现社会主义现代化的重要条件和题中应有之义。没有民主就没有社会主义。作为以解放全人类为己任的工人阶级的先锋队组织，作为忠实代表各族人民根本利益的共产党，绝对没有拒绝和害怕民主的任何根据和理由。民主是人类进步历史中具有继承性的重要遗产之一。因此，在建设社会主义民主政治的过程中，完全应该和可能借鉴资本主义制度下产生的一些民主的做法、形式和一些具体制度，但决不能照搬同资本主义本质特征相联系的那一套。这是因为，体现广大人民当家作主权力和民主权利的社会主义民主，同旨在维护资产阶级统治的资本主义民主，有着不可混淆的原则区别。我们必须从本质上划清两者之间的界限。有人鼓吹所谓的“精英”政治，鼓吹政治多元化和多党轮流执政，其实质是把广大劳动人民排除在享受民主权利之外，否定和取消共产党的领导地位，是对社会主义民主的极大破坏，是我们所决不能容许的。社会主义民主又是同极端民主化和无政府主义绝对不相容的。极端民主化盛行，无政府主义泛滥，如同“文化大革命”和这次动乱、暴乱期间已经出现过的那样，其结果只能彻底违反宪法和法律，严重破坏法制，使一切真正的民主秩序和制度荡然无存，给人民带来巨大的灾难。总之，我们的社会主义民主建设，必须从我国的国情出发，在党的领导下有计划、有步骤地进行，并且把它同加强社会主义法制建设很好地结合起来，这样才能真正造福于人民和真正有利于建设有中国特色的社会主义。
    ——坚持物质文明建设和精神文明建设一齐抓，两手抓，是建设有中国特色的社会主义的本质要求，也是实现社会主义现代化的基本战略方针。坚决克服一个时期以来只重视物质文明建设，不重视精神文明建设，前一手硬后一手软的偏向，既是当前的紧迫任务，也是需要长期重视的重大问题。社会主义社会应该具有高度的精神文明，这是社会主义社会的一个极为重要的基本特征。当然，离开发展社会生产力这个根本任务，离开以经济建设为中心，离开物质生产水平的提高，侈谈精神文明建设，是错误的。但是，如果以为生产发展了，物质生活水平提高了，精神文明建设就会自然而然地上去，这同样也是错误的。特别应该引起人们注意的是，只抓物质文明建设，只注意发展生产，严重忽视精神文明建设，忽视培养和造就有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义新人，不仅难以获得促进社会生产力发展的强大精神力量，而且社会主义社会还有走向畸形发展的危险，甚至有走向蜕化变质的危险。大体说来，社会主义的精神文明建设，包含着教育、科学、文化建设和以马克思主义为指导的政治、思想、道德建设。任何文明的国家和社会都需要教育、科学、文化事业的发展，社会主义国家和社会尤其需要扩大这方面的发展规模和提高这方面的发展速度，尽快改变这方面的落后状态。而以马克思主义为指导的政治、思想、道德建设，直接影响和决定着社会主义社会的发展方向，更容不得对它有丝毫的忽视。前些年由于对社会主义精神文明建设的放松和削弱，导致新中国早已绝迹的许多丑恶现象又沉渣泛起，直接或间接地影响动乱、暴乱期间许多横行霸道、无法无天行为的发生和发展，这也是我们由此而不能不吞食的一个苦果。
    ——恢复、发展乃至在一定的意义上重建党和人民群众的血肉联系，坚决克服严重脱离群众的种种腐败现象，极大地增强党在广大人民群众中的凝聚力、吸引力、号召力，是关系党的生死存亡的大事，也是建设有中国特色的社会主义能够不断取得胜利的根本保证。我们党是在群众斗争中产生、发展和壮大起来的。离开了人民群众的支持，党一天也不能生存。对于这个真理，在许多同志的思想上，一个时期以来令人遗憾地越来越淡漠了。党自从执政以后，某种官僚主义、命令主义、腐化堕落等脱离群众的现象滋长了。特别是这些年来由于削弱了党的建设，削弱了思想政治工作，淡化了党的领导作用，党在政治、思想、组织、作风等方面存在的问题更加重了。当然，这次动乱、暴乱的严峻考验证明，我们党在总体上还是好的，是坚强有力的。极少数阴谋分子以反腐败为名，妄图推翻共产党，颠覆社会主义制度，广大人民决不会答应，他们的反革命阴谋决不可能得逞。但是，如果党对自身的确存在的某些腐败现象不惩治，不坚决克服，任其发展下去，就会走向自我毁灭，这是最危险的。动乱、暴乱中有那么多人卷入，酿成大祸，造成重大损失，群众对腐败现象不满，无疑也是一个重要原因。正是基于这样的反思，从中吸取了深刻的教训，党从十三届四中全会以来，一是强调从领导做起，带头作出表率，一是强调狠抓实事，不说空话，已经把惩治腐败、推进廉政建设的工作，更加坚定不移地开展起来，并已开始取得成效。对这一点，人民群众是欢迎和拥护的。对此，一方面希望各级党组织特别是领导机构要坚持不懈，一抓到底，决不手软；另一方面我们广大的人民群众也要从爱护自己的党和政府出发，积极检举，加强监督，帮助党和政府惩治腐败，真正做到清正廉明，更好地为人民服务，同群众心连心。这样，我们的党就一定能够更好地率领群众完成实现社会主义现代化的宏图大业。……
    江泽民同志在结束他的国庆讲话时郑重宣称：
    “历史已经证明并将继续证明，社会主义制度具有强大的历史活力和蓬勃生机。”“社会主义代替资本主义是真正的历史大趋势，是人类从必然王国进入自由王国的一个决定性阶段。”
    “我们回顾过去，展望未来，立足中国，放眼世界，对社会主义事业充满信心，对人类的共产主义前途充满信心。”
    这是真理，是中国人民首先是共产党人的坚强信念。我们应该坚决相信这样的真理和牢固确立这样的信念。这样，我们就不会只看到社会主义发展过程中出现的某些漩涡和逆流而看不到历史长河的奔腾，从而犯政治上的短视病；我们就一定能够百倍增强排除万难、不折不挠的勇气和信心，坚定把有中国特色的社会主义宏伟事业不断推向前进。
