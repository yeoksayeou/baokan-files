Marching Forward on the Socialist Path
— Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China

After the suppression of the turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, in the new situation of political stability and economic development, we welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The people of all ethnic groups across the country are filled with enthusiasm and are celebrating their glorious national day. On this day of national jubilation, we pay tribute to the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and patriotic figures from all walks of life across the nation! We pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army, public security personnel, and the People's Armed Police who have made outstanding contributions in defending the People's Republic! For the liberation of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, generations have fought bravely. After the founding of the nation, the people of the entire country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, continued to struggle arduously. As we welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, we cherish the memory of the countless revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives in different historical periods and express our heartfelt thanks to all comrades who have contributed to the liberation and prosperity of our motherland.

The 40 years of the People's Republic of China have been 40 years of profound changes on Chinese soil, 40 years of a 5,000-year-old ancient country regaining its vitality and striding forward, and 40 years of the Chinese people's status in the world rising rapidly and holding their heads high. At this moment, reflecting on the past and looking to the future, we are inspired, confident, and empowered. The China of the past was a poor and backward semi-colonial, semi-feudal country, with a devastated economy, frequent wars, social unrest, a suffering populace, political corruption, national weakness, and poverty. It was known as the "Sick Man of East Asia." Today's China has become a socialist country that is initially prosperous and flourishing, with a clear political environment, social stability, economic development, and people living and working in peace and contentment. Education, science, and cultural undertakings are thriving, and in contemporary international affairs, the People's Republic of China is playing an increasingly important role. The history of the Chinese people being bullied and carved up by others is long gone. What force has brought about such tremendous changes in China? The fundamental reason is that the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to choose the socialist path. History has proven and will continue to prove that only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China.

China's choice of the socialist path was not accidental. In the 19th century, Marx and Engels established the great theory of scientific socialism, and the October Revolution gave birth to the world's first socialist country. The Communist Party of China deeply summarized the bitter lessons of the Chinese nation's suffering from invasion and oppression over nearly a century, scientifically analyzed the global development trend, led the Chinese people to overthrow the "three mountains" (imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism), and resolutely chose the socialist path. We have established the fundamental political system of people's democratic dictatorship, which fundamentally guarantees the power and democratic rights of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and all patriotic people to manage state and social affairs. In the economy, we have established the fundamental socialist economic system with public ownership of the means of production and distribution according to work, which fundamentally guarantees the interests of the broad masses of laboring people and is conducive to giving full play to their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity. Practice has proven that only socialism can make China independent and stable, and develop. Socialism suits China's national conditions and is deeply loved by the people. After 40 years of ups and downs, socialism has taken deep root in the land of China, growing into a towering tree, lush and vigorous. This spring and summer, a small number of people plotted and instigated turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, attempting to uproot socialism from China. Their actions go against the historical trend and the will of hundreds of millions of people, and can only end up in a miserable failure.

Over the past 40 years, the process of combining the basic principles of scientific socialism with China's construction has been one of practice, cognition, more practice, and more cognition. The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee marked a profound leap in our understanding of this issue, recognizing that in a backward Eastern country like China, socialism cannot be copied from any other country but must start from China's actual situation and implement socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is precisely based on this understanding that we have carried out reforms in various aspects, from rural areas to cities, from economic systems to political systems, and achieved remarkable results. The 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have been the period when the country's strength has increased the fastest and the people have benefited the most in the past 40 years. The recent 10 years and the past 30 years are inseparable; they are two consecutive chapters in the history of the People's Republic. The recent 10 years are a continuation and development of the past 30 years. In terms of implementing the basic economic and political systems of socialism, they are consistent; the biggest difference between them is that the socialism implemented in the past 30 years was not very characteristic of China, while the socialism implemented in the recent 10 years is increasingly characteristic of China. This difference does not weaken people's belief in socialism but strengthens it. Socialism in China and in the world is a brand-new social system with great potential and vitality. The attempt to deny the superiority of socialism by seizing on certain flaws in the existing system is completely futile.

The Communist Party of China is the strong core leading the people of all ethnic groups in China to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. The achievements of the past 40 years have all been made under the correct leadership of the Party, relying on the efforts of the people across the country. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; without the Communist Party, there would be no prosperity and strength of China. Due to various complex reasons, the Communist Party of China has also made serious mistakes, but these mistakes have been recognized and corrected by the Party itself. The people of the whole country have deeply felt from their personal experiences that the Communist Party of China is working for the interests of the nation and the people, that the socialist cause cannot do without the leadership of the Communist Party, and that there is no other political force in China that can replace the leadership of the Communist Party. After 40 years of practice, the Party's experience in leading socialist construction has become richer. In China, the socialist cause is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party. To support socialism is to support the leadership of the Communist Party. Any action that shakes or weakens the Party's leadership will inevitably harm our socialist cause.

The Chinese nation is a nation with strong cohesion and centripetal force. Loving the motherland, being loyal to the motherland, and serving the motherland are traditional virtues of our nation. It is precisely this virtue that has been passed down from generation to generation, leaving countless moving chapters of patriotism in China's long history. Patriotism is a powerful spiritual force driving the modernization of socialism. To build socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must vigorously carry forward the spirit of patriotism. Patriotism has different contents in different eras. Today, we have the broadest patriotic united front, including the people of all ethnic groups across the country, compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas Chinese, all striving for national reunification and the rejuvenation of China. On the mainland of China, patriotism and socialism are essentially united. To seek the prosperity and strength of the Chinese nation, there is no other way but socialism. Therefore, all patriots who hope for a strong China will certainly become loyal socialists or reliable friends of socialism. The facts revealed in the suppression of the turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary riots show that a small number of people who insist on the bourgeois liberalization stance are the ones who start from opposing socialism and slide into the abyss of betraying the motherland. Today, without socialism and without the leadership of the Communist Party, talking about patriotism is divorced from China's reality. Every true patriot should recognize the intrinsic link between the leadership of the Communist Party, the socialist path, and the strength of the Chinese nation, and contribute to the cause of building a socialist motherland. Of course, compatriots in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and overseas Chinese, as long as they support the cause of national reunification, are patriots. We do not require them to all accept the socialist system. However, we believe that true patriots will not oppose the sacred choice of 1.1 billion Chinese people to walk the socialist path.

We are building socialism on the basis of a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country. This means that when those developed capitalist countries were already quite developed, we were just starting out. In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, our development has been rapid, and our gross national product has already ranked among the world's top. However, China is a country with 1.1 billion people, and on a per capita basis, we are still behind in the world. To catch up with and surpass the developed countries in terms of per capita national income, we still need the arduous efforts of several generations. We must inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of dedication of our predecessors and contribute everything we have to the long-term stability, prosperity, and happiness of the nation and the people. The Communist Party of China has planned a grand blueprint for the rejuvenation of our nation and formulated the strategic goals of socialist economic construction in three steps. Now, the goal of the first step has been achieved, and we are advancing towards the second step goal, which is to double the gross national product and reach a moderately prosperous level of living standards for the people by the end of this century. We are confident that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the unity and solidarity of the people of all ethnic groups across the country, with self-reliance and hard work, the second and third step goals will definitely be achieved. Socialism will definitely surpass capitalism. Time and the future belong to us. In another 10 years, when we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, socialism in China will surely shine with even more brilliant light!

    沿着社会主义大道奋勇前进
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国成立四十周年
    在制止动乱和平息了发生在北京的反革命暴乱之后，在政治稳定、经济发展的新形势下，我们迎来了中华人民共和国成立40周年。
    全国各族人民满怀激情，热烈庆祝自己的光辉节日。在这举国欢庆的日子里，我们向全国各民族工人、农民、知识分子和各界爱国人士致敬！向在保卫人民共和国的斗争中立下卓越功勋的中国人民解放军、公安干警和武警部队致敬！为了中国人民的解放，为了创建中华人民共和国，几代人进行了英勇的奋斗。建国以后，全国人民在共产党的领导之下，继续进行艰苦的斗争。当我们迎来建国40周年的时候，我们无限缅怀在不同历史时期流血牺牲的千千万万革命先烈，衷心感谢为祖国的解放和繁荣作出过贡献的所有的同志。
    中华人民共和国的40年，是中国大地发生深刻变革的40年，是五千年古国焕发蓬勃生机、阔步前进的40年，是中国人在世界上的地位迅速提高、扬眉吐气的40年。此时此刻，抚今追昔，给人启示，给人信心，给人力量。昔日的中国，是个一穷二白的半殖民地、半封建国家，经济凋敝，战乱频仍，社会动荡，民不聊生，政治腐败，国弱民穷，以“东亚病夫”闻名于世。而今天的中国，已经变成一个初步繁荣昌盛的社会主义国家，政治清明，社会安定，经济发展，人民安居乐业，教育、科学、文化事业欣欣向荣，在当代国际事务中，中华人民共和国发挥了越来越重要的作用。中国人任人摆布、任人宰割的历史早已一去不复返了。是什么力量使中国发生了如此巨大的变化？最根本的原因是中国共产党领导中国人民选择了社会主义道路。历史已经证明并将继续证明，只有社会主义才能救中国，只有社会主义才能发展中国。
    中国走上社会主义道路不是偶然的。19世纪马克思、恩格斯创立了科学社会主义的伟大学说，十月革命诞生了世界上第一个社会主义国家。中国共产党深刻总结了中华民族近百年来受侵略、受奴役的沉痛教训，科学分析了世界发展的大趋势，领导中国人民推翻了三座大山，毅然走上了社会主义道路。我们在政治上实行人民民主专政的基本政治制度，从根本上保证了工人、农民、知识分子和一切爱国人士管理国家和社会事务的权力和他们的民主权利；在经济上实行以生产资料公有制和按劳分配为主体的社会主义基本经济制度，从根本上保证了广大劳动人民的利益，有利于发挥他们的主动性、积极性、创造性。实践证明，只有社会主义才能使中国独立自主，稳定、发展。社会主义适合中国国情，深受人民拥护。经过40年的风风雨雨，社会主义在神州大地上已经深深扎下根来，长成了参天大树，葱茏繁茂，生机勃勃。今年春夏之交，极少数人策划、煽动动乱和反革命暴乱，妄图把社会主义从中国连根拔掉。他们这种行径逆历史的潮流，违亿万人的意志，当然只能落个搬起石头打自己脚的可悲下场。
    40年来，如何使科学社会主义的基本原理与中国建设的实际相结合，经历了一个实践、认识、再实践、再认识的过程。党的十一届三中全会标志着我们对这个问题的认识实现了有深远影响的飞跃，认识到在中国这个经济文化基础非常落后的东方大国实行社会主义，不能照搬任何其他国家的模式，必须从中国的实际出发，实行有中国特色的社会主义。正是基于这种认识，我们从农村到城市，从经济体制到政治体制，进行了多方面的改革，取得了显著的成效。十一届三中全会以来的10年，是40年来国家实力增强最快、人民得到实惠最多的时期。最近的10年与过去的30年是不可分割的，它们是人民共和国历史上前后相接的两个篇章，最近的10年是过去30年的继续和发展。在实行社会主义基本的经济制度和政治制度上，它们是一脉相承的；它们之间最大的区别在于，前30年实行的社会主义是中国特色不明显的社会主义，近10年实行的社会主义则是中国特色越来越鲜明的社会主义。这种区别不是使人们削弱了社会主义信念，而是增强了社会主义信念。社会主义在中国，在全世界，都是崭新的社会制度，具有巨大的潜力和生命力。那种抓住现行体制中某些弊端来否定社会主义优越性的企图，完全是徒劳的。
    中国共产党是领导我国各族人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的坚强核心。40年来的成就，都是在党的正确领导下，依靠全国人民的努力所取得的。没有共产党，就没有新中国；没有共产党，也就没有中国的兴旺发达。由于种种复杂的原因，中国共产党也曾发生过重大失误，但是这些失误无一例外都是我们党自己认识并纠正的。全国人民从亲身经历中深深体会到，中国共产党是为民族、为人民谋利益的，社会主义事业离不开共产党的领导，在中国没有任何其他政治力量能够代替共产党的领导。经过40年的实践，党领导社会主义建设的经验更加丰富。在中国，社会主义事业与共产党的领导密不可分，拥护社会主义就必然拥护共产党的领导。任何动摇或削弱党的领导的行为，都必然损害我们的社会主义事业。
    中华民族是有强大凝聚力、向心力的民族。热爱祖国、忠于祖国、报效祖国，是我们民族的传统美德。正是这种美德世代相传，在中国悠久的历史上留下了无数可歌可泣的爱国主义篇章。爱国主义是推动社会主义现代化建设的强大精神力量，为建设有中国特色的社会主义，我们必须大力弘扬爱国主义精神。爱国主义在不同的时代有不同的内容。今天，我们有着包括全国各民族人民，包括台湾、港澳同胞和海外侨胞在内的最广泛的爱国统一战线，为统一祖国、振兴中华而努力。在中国大陆，爱国主义和社会主义在本质上是统一的。为求中华民族的繁荣昌盛，舍社会主义别无他途。因此，一切希望中国强大的爱国者，必定成为忠诚的社会主义者或社会主义的可靠朋友。制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱中揭露出来的事实表明，极少数坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，正是从反对社会主义开始，滑到背叛祖国的深渊的。今天，离开社会主义，离开共产党的领导来谈爱国主义，就离开了中国的实际。每一个真正的爱国主义者，都应当认清共产党的领导、社会主义道路同中华民族的强盛之间密不可分的内在联系，为社会主义祖国的建设事业做出贡献。当然，在台湾和港澳的同胞，在海外的侨胞，凡是拥护、支持祖国统一事业的，都是爱国者。我们并不要求他们都接受社会主义制度。但是，我们相信，真正的爱国者绝不会反对11亿中国人民乐意走社会主义道路这种神圣的选择。
    我们是在半殖民地、半封建的基础上建设社会主义的。这就是说，当着那些发达的资本主义国家已经相当发达的时候，我们才起步。建国40年来，我们的发展是快的，国民生产总值已经居于世界的前列。但是，中国是11亿人口的大国，按人口平均，还在世界的后面。我们要在人均国民收入上接近、赶上和超过发达的国家，还需要几代人的艰苦努力。我们要继承和发扬我们前辈的革命献身精神，为国家的长治久安、繁荣昌盛和人民的幸福，贡献出自己的一切。中国共产党为我们民族的振兴规划了宏伟的蓝图，制定了社会主义经济建设分三步走的战略目标。现在，第一步的目标已经实现，正在向第二步目标挺进，这就是在本世纪末使国民生产总值再翻一番，人民生活达到小康水平。我们坚信，在中国共产党的领导下，全国各族人民团结一致，同心同德，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，第二步目标和第三步目标都是一定可以实现的。社会主义必定优于资本主义。时间和未来，是属于我们的。再过10年，当我们庆祝人民共和国成立50周年的时候，社会主义在中国必将发出更加灿烂的光辉！
