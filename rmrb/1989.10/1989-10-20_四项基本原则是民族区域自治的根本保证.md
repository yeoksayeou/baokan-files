The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of our state and the fundamental guarantee for ethnic regional autonomy in China. The preamble of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy explicitly stipulates the Four Cardinal Principles. Their significance is as pointed out in the explanatory note to the draft of the law: upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is the common political foundation for the unity and progress of all ethnic groups in the country, and it is also the fundamental principle for the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. This is the fundamental guiding ideology for drafting the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. However, in the previous period, due to the influence of the bourgeois liberalization trend of thought, some bourgeois liberalization fallacies emerged in the field of ethnic regional autonomy, which affected and hindered the implementation, propaganda, education, and scientific research work of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy to a certain extent. Some hostile forces abroad also attempted to use ethnic issues to create ethnic and national splits, aiming to overthrow the People's Republic of China.

Facts have proven that in the 40 years since the founding of the nation, and the 5 years since the implementation of the autonomy law, the achievements in ethnic regional autonomy work are the result of the guarantee provided by the Four Cardinal Principles. The main manifestations are as follows:

First, ethnic regional autonomy is the basic policy of the Communist Party of China in solving the ethnic issues of the country using Marxism-Leninism. Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on May 1, 1947, a total of 154 autonomous regions have been established, including 5 autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures, and 119 autonomous counties (banners). Among the 55 ethnic minorities in the country, 45 have implemented regional autonomy. Autonomous ethnic regions account for about 64% of the national territory, and the population of ethnic minorities implementing autonomy accounts for about 80% of the total ethnic minority population in the country. Additionally, more than 1,500 ethnic townships have been restored and established. These achievements are hard-won. They are the result of the Communist Party of China's correct application of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in solving ethnic issues, combined with China's actual situation, and long-term exploration and practice to conclude the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy. It has been continuously improved and developed through several decades of testing in socialist construction.

Second, ethnic regional autonomy, as an important political system of the state, is an important manifestation of the socialist people's democratic dictatorship. From the Common Program before the founding of the nation to the 1982 Constitution, the system of ethnic regional autonomy has always been an important content of the country's constitutional system. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the democratic construction within the system of ethnic regional autonomy has been developed and strengthened, and has gradually moved towards legalization. For example, the Constitution, Election Law, and Organizational Law, and other legal regulations have made detailed provisions on the proportion of representatives of ethnic autonomous regions and various ethnic minorities in the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels, as well as election issues. Whether it is an ethnic minority with more than a million people or around a thousand, they all have their own representatives in the National People's Congress and local people's congresses (in the place of residence of the ethnic minority), and the number of representatives increases with each term. For instance, according to the Constitution and the autonomy law, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress, the chairman of the autonomous region, the governor of the autonomous prefecture, and the magistrate of the autonomous county in ethnic autonomous regions are all fully held by citizens of the ethnic group implementing regional autonomy; in the various levels of state organs in ethnic autonomous regions, the "nationalization of cadres" of the ethnic group implementing regional autonomy and other ethnic minorities has been basically realized. Furthermore, the People's Congress and the People's Government of ethnic autonomous regions, mainly composed of citizens of the ethnic group implementing regional autonomy, have more extensive autonomy than general local power organs, including legislative, language and script, labor and personnel, economic and financial, cultural and educational, public security forces, floating population, family planning, environmental protection, and more than ten aspects of autonomy. These aspects of democratic and legal construction reflect the spirit of the state fully respecting and guaranteeing the rights of various ethnic minorities to manage state affairs and internal affairs of their own ethnic groups, and reflect the principle of the state adhering to the equality, unity, and common prosperity of all ethnic groups.

Third, the socialist road is the only way to accelerate the development of various construction undertakings in ethnic autonomous regions. The socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, and mutual assistance, and the basic state policy of common prosperity of all ethnic groups, are a basic characteristic of Chinese socialism. The state, in order to accelerate the development of socialist economic and cultural construction in ethnic autonomous regions, has stipulated various principles of leadership and assistance to ethnic autonomous regions in the Constitution, autonomy law, organizational law, and other laws. Over the past 40 years, with the strong support of the state in finance, materials, technology, talent, and other aspects, ethnic autonomous regions have undergone earth-shaking changes. 1. In the cultivation of ethnic minority cadres, the Party and the state attach great importance to the construction of the ethnic minority cadre team, making the ethnic cadre team in China continuously develop and grow. By the end of 1988, it had increased nearly 20 times compared to the early days of the founding of the nation, and 119.7% compared to 1978. From party and government management cadres to economic management cadres, and various technical cadres, a team gradually adapted to the socialist modernization construction of ethnic autonomous regions has been formed. 2. In ethnic education construction, ethnic education has been long-term supported by the state, and the state has specially established ethnic education supplementary special funds. The central and relevant provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have established ethnic education management institutions. The central and local governments have 11 ethnic institutes, and some colleges and universities across the country have opened ethnic classes; 17 provinces and municipalities in the interior have also set up Tibet middle school classes; autonomous prefectures have ethnic teachers' colleges, autonomous counties have ethnic middle schools, ethnic townships and villages have ethnic primary schools, pastoral areas and remote mountainous areas have boarding ethnic schools; there are already 101 ordinary colleges and universities in ethnic autonomous regions across the country; and so on. The ethnic education system has initially taken shape. In 1988, the number of ethnic minority students in schools at all levels was tens to nearly a hundred times more than in 1951. Among them, in 1988, there were 125,422 ethnic minority students in colleges and universities across the country, an increase of 97.6 times compared to the early days of the founding of the nation. All 55 ethnic minorities have a certain number of college students, and some have even cultivated master's and doctoral students. 3. In ethnic cultural construction, radio, film, and television industries have gone from non-existent to large-scale. Before the founding of the nation, ethnic language broadcasting was almost a blank, and now 12 provinces and autonomous regions across the country have set up ethnic language broadcasting; 11 provinces and autonomous regions across the country have set up 48 ethnic language and dialect film dubbing points, and ethnic television stations have also opened ethnic language programs; there are 35 publishing houses across the country that publish ethnic minority language books, which can publish books in more than 20 ethnic minority languages, and there are 84 newspaper publishing houses that publish ethnic minority language newspapers; ethnic minority language publications in the book sector have developed from 176 types and 1.68 million copies in 1949 to 3,294 types and 38.16 million copies in 1988, magazines from 4 types and 120,000 copies in 1949 to 154 types and 13.5 million copies in 1988, newspapers from 2.42 million copies in 1949 to 134.11 million copies in 1988. 4. In ethnic economic development, the achievements are even more remarkable. According to statistics, from 1979 to 1988, the cumulative investment in basic construction projects of state-owned enterprises in ethnic autonomous regions in China was 82.04 billion yuan, which was 24.02 billion yuan more than the total investment of 58.052 billion yuan in the 29 years from 1950 to 1978; in 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value was 109.233 billion yuan (calculated at 1980 constant prices), which was 19.5 times more than 3.66 billion yuan in 1949, of which agriculture increased more than 5 times, and industry increased 116 times; in 1988, the total grain output reached 43.614 million tons, which was nearly 3 times more than in 1949; by the end of 1988, the total number of livestock was 209.3816 million head (units), which was more than 4 times the 41.08 million head (units) in 1949; in 1988, the total length of railways in operation was 12,733 kilometers, which was 262.7% more than the 3,511 kilometers in 1949; in 1988, the total length of highways in operation was 276,829 kilometers, which was 23.3 times more than the 11,400 kilometers in 1949; from having almost no modern industry before the founding of the nation to now having 53,500 industrial enterprises (excluding villages and below); in 1988, the per capita net income of agricultural and pastoral areas was 436 yuan.

    四项基本原则是民族区域自治的根本保证
    吴宗金
    四项基本原则是我们的立国之本，是我国民族区域自治的根本保证。《民族区域自治法》序言明确规定四项基本原则，其意义正如自治法草案说明所指出的那样：坚持四项基本原则，是全国各族人民团结前进的共同政治基础，也是全国各民族共同繁荣的根本原则。这是起草民族区域自治法的根本指导思想。但是，在前一段时期，由于受资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，在民族区域自治领域中也曾出现了一些资产阶级自由化的奇谈怪论，使民族区域自治法的贯彻实施、宣传、教育、教学科研工作受到了一定的影响和妨碍。国外的一些敌对势力也极力在利用民族问题制造民族分裂和国家分裂，妄图颠覆中华人民共和国。
    事实证明，建国40年来，自治法实施5年来，民族区域自治工作取得的辉煌成就，就是在四项基本原则这个根本前提作保障下的结果。其主要表现在：
    一、民族区域自治是中国共产党运用马列主义解决我国民族问题的基本政策。我国的民族自治地方自内蒙古自治区从1947年5月1日建立以来，至今已经建立了154个，其中5个自治区，30个自治州，119个自治县（旗）。在全国55个少数民族中，已经有45个少数民族实行了区域自治，民族自治地方占国土的64％左右，实行自治的民族人口占全国少数民族人口的80％左右。还恢复和建立了1500多个民族乡。这些成就来之不易，它是中国共产党在几十年的革命斗争中，正确运用马列主义关于解决民族问题的基本原则，结合中国的实际，经过长时期的探索和实践所得出的实行民族区域自治的结论，并且在社会主义建设中经受了几十年的考验才得到不断的完善和发展。
    二、民族区域自治作为国家的一项重要政治制度，是社会主义人民民主专政制度的一个重要表现形式。从建国前夕的《共同纲领》到1982年的新宪法，民族区域自治制度一直是我国宪政中的一项重要内容。特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，民族区域自治制度中的民主建设又得到了发展和加强，并且逐步走向法制化。例如，宪法、选举法、组织法等法律法规，对民族自治地方和各少数民族在全国和地方各级人民代表大会及其常委会的代表名额比例、以及选举等问题都作了详细的规定，不论是千万人以上或是千人左右的少数民族，在全国人大和地方人大（所在地的少数民族）都有了他们自己的代表，而且一届比一届增多。再如，根据宪法和自治法的规定，民族自治地方的人民代表大会常委会中的主任或者副主任、人民政府的自治区主席、自治州州长、自治县县长都已全部实现由实行区域自治的民族的公民担任；在民族自治地方的各级国家机关，基本实现了实行区域自治民族和其他少数民族的“干部民族化”。又如，主要由实行区域自治的民族的公民组成的民族自治地方的人民代表大会和人民政府，较之一般的地方政权机关，它们拥有更为广泛的自治权，包括立法、语言文字、劳动人事、经济财政、文化教育、公安部队、流动人口、计划生育、环境保护等十多个方面的自治权，等等。这些方方面面的民主法制建设，体现了国家充分尊重和保障各少数民族管理国家和本民族内部事务权利的精神，体现了国家坚持实行各民族平等、团结和共同繁荣的原则。
    三、社会主义道路是加速发展民族自治地方各项建设事业的唯一途径。各民族平等，团结和互助的社会主义民族关系、各民族共同繁荣的基本国策，是我国社会主义的一个基本特征。国家为加速发展民族自治地方的社会主义经济和文化建设事业，在宪法、自治法、组织法等法律规定了对民族自治地方的领导和帮助的各项原则。40年来，民族自治地方在国家的财政、物资、技术、人才等各方面的大力帮助下，已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。1、在少数民族干部的培养方面，党和国家十分重视对少数民族干部队伍的建设，使我国的民族干部队伍不断发展壮大。到1988年底，比建国初期增长了近20倍，比1978年增长119.7％。从党政管理干部到经济管理干部、以及各种科技干部，形成了逐步走向适应民族自治地方的社会主义四个现代化建设的发展。2、在民族教育建设方面，民族教育得到国家长期扶持，国家专门设立了民族教育的补助专项经费，中央和有关省、自治区、市设立了民族教育事业的管理机构，中央和地方已有11所民族学院，全国部分高校开办了民族班，内地17个省市还办了西藏中学班；自治州有民族师专，自治县有民族中学，民族乡村有民族小学，牧区和边远山区有寄宿制民族学校；全国民族自治地方已有普通高校101所；等等，民族教育体系已经初具规模。1988年各级各类学校少数民族在校生人数较之1951年有几十倍、近百倍的增加，其中1988年全国高等学校少数民族在校生为125422人，比建国初期增长97.6倍。55个少数民族都有一定数量的大学生，有的还培养出硕士、博士研究生。3、在民族文化建设方面，广播、电影、电视事业从无到有从小到大。建国前民族语广播几乎一片空白，现全国已有12个省、自治区办起了民族语广播；全国已有11个省、自治区设有48个民族语及方言电影译制点，民族地区的电视台还开办了民族语节目；全国有35家出版少数民族文字图书的出版社，可出版20多种少数民族文字的图书，还有84家出版少数民族文字报纸的报社；少数民族文字的出版物在图书方面从1949年的176种168万份发展到1988年的3294种3816万份，杂志从1949年的4种12万份发展到1988年的154种1350万份，报纸从1949年的242万份发展到1988年的13411万份。4、在民族经济发展方面，成就更为显著。据统计，从1979年到1988年，我国民族自治地方全民所有制单位的基本建设投资累计为820.4亿元，比1950年到1978年29年中的总投资580.52亿元还多；1988年工农业总产值完成1092.33亿元（以1980年不变价格计算），比1949年的36.6亿元增长19.5倍，其中农业增长5倍多，工业增长116倍；1988年粮食的总产量达到4361.4万吨，比1949年增长近3倍；1988年末的牲畜总头数20938.16万头（只），比1949年的4108万头（只）增长4倍多；1988年铁路通车里程为12733公里，比1949年的3511公里增长262.7％；1988年公路通车里程为276829公里，比1949年的11400公里增长23.3倍；由建国前基本没有现代工业发展到现在的5.35万个工业企业（未含村及村以下）；1988年农牧业区人均纯收入已达436元。
