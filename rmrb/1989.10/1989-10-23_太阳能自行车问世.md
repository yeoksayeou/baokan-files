A novel solar-powered bicycle has recently been introduced in the Federal Republic of Germany, according to a report in the British magazine *New Scientist*.

This bicycle can reach speeds of up to 45 kilometers per hour. The solar panels mounted on the rear rack of the bicycle convert solar energy into electrical energy, which is then supplied to the motor. This electrical energy supplements the energy provided by the rider pedaling, thereby accelerating the bicycle. When the sun is obscured by clouds, the stored energy in the internal battery can power the bicycle for 3 hours without the need for pedaling.

　　太阳能自行车问世
    据英国《新科学家》杂志报道，最近，一种新颖太阳能自行车在联邦德国问世。
    这种自行车时速可达45公里。在这种自行车后架上的太阳能组件能供给马达能量，使其转变成电。这种电能可以补充骑车人转动脚蹬时需要的能量，从而使自行车加速。当太阳隐藏在云层后面时，内装电池的电能可供骑车人骑3小时而不必蹬自行车。
