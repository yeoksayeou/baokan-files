    Song for Officials' Integrity

    (To the tune of "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention")

    1. Love the people, serve the people,
    Be honest and upright, be diligent and frugal.
    Do not seek personal gain,
    Do not take bribes, do not be corrupt.

    2. Be strict with yourself, be strict with others,
    Uphold principles, do not bend the rules.
    Do not take advantage of your position,
    Do not use public funds for private gain.

    3. Be fair and just, be impartial,
    Do not favoritism, do not be biased.
    Do not seek personal glory,
    Do not use power for personal gain.

    4. Be honest and trustworthy, be reliable,
    Do not deceive the people, do not betray their trust.
    Do not take advantage of your position,
    Do not use public funds for private gain.

    5. Be diligent and frugal, be thrifty,
    Do not waste public funds, do not be extravagant.
    Do not seek personal comfort,
    Do not use public funds for private gain.

    6. Be honest and upright, be diligent and frugal,
    Do not seek personal gain, do not be corrupt.
    Do not take bribes, do not be dishonest,
    Uphold principles, do not bend the rules.

    7. Be fair and just, be impartial,
    Do not favoritism, do not be biased.
    Do not seek personal glory,
    Do not use power for personal gain.

    8. Be honest and trustworthy, be reliable,
    Do not deceive the people, do not betray their trust.
    Do not take advantage of your position,
    Do not use public funds for private gain.
