In the foothills of Mount Wutai lies Dongye Town. In this town, 16 out of 16 middle and primary schools have dilapidated buildings, accounting for 86% of the total. Some schools have only four bare walls, and students use bricks, stones, and mud blocks as desks and chairs. Those who cannot build desks and chairs have to sit on the ground to attend classes.

How can this backward situation be changed? The people of Dongye did the math: relying on the annual educational infrastructure subsidy of one million yuan from the state, it would take over a hundred years to renovate these 16 middle and primary schools. Children can't wait, and mountain development can't wait either. Therefore, they turned their attention to themselves. This small town, with an average annual income of only 400 yuan, managed to raise 26.5 million yuan from the public between 1984 and 1988 to complete the renovation of all middle and primary schools in the town. Now, all middle and primary schools in the town have achieved six configurations: walls, gates, school buildings, playgrounds, desks, and chairs. Some have even achieved six additional configurations: reading rooms, laboratories, libraries, water and heating, and electricity.

Regions like Dongye Town, where educational funds are severely lacking, are not rare in the country. Even in large cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the situation is not much better. However, mountain people can calculate the costs, but city people may not be able to. The reason is simple: the state provides less for mountain people, and they are less dependent on the state, making it easier for them to take the initiative. City people, on the other hand, have been pampered by the state and find it harder to take the initiative. Recently, it was heard that some cities, after careful calculation, prepared to adjust the tuition and miscellaneous fees for middle and primary schools in the near future but withdrew the plan. Should the adjustment not be made? No. For many years, prices have risen, but the tuition and miscellaneous fees for middle and primary schools have remained at the 1950s standard, retaining only a symbolic shell. It is inevitable to adjust. Is the adjustment too large, exceeding people's economic tolerance? No. An annual fee of thirty to forty yuan is not a large amount for urban families with an average annual income of 1,119 yuan (1988 value). So, what is the reason? According to informed sources, one reason is that the government considers that the rising prices have already caused many troubles for the people, and implementing the plan too quickly will increase the burden on the people; the other reason is the concern that parents lack psychological tolerance.

Setting aside the factor of prices, should families bear some of the educational expenses? Of course, they should. The beneficiaries of education are certainly the state and the nation, but the primary and direct beneficiaries are families and individuals. Education not only enables the educated to increase their labor productivity and creativity, thereby increasing personal income, but also enables the educated to gain a healthy, civilized, and scientific way of life, laying the foundation for the happiness of individuals, families, and future generations. It also reduces many tangible and intangible expenses in material consumption. Whoever benefits should contribute, which is only natural. Some parents adopt an outsider's attitude towards education, which is related to the long-term policy of the Chinese government to take full responsibility for education and the one-sidedness in our educational propaganda. It also reflects that some parents lack understanding of the national conditions and need to change some of their ideas.

For example, the Chinese government's investment in education is seriously insufficient. The money that should and could be used for education has not been used for education, which is a fact that no one can deny. Increasing the government's investment in education has become a unanimous call from all sectors of society. However, some parents have developed a misconception that once the government's investment in education is sufficient, China's educational cause will be able to get out of the trough. Is this the case? Let's do the math.

"The Difficulties of 'Poor Country, Big Education'"
The national conditions of China's education can be summarized in six words: "Poor Country, Big Education." When we say the country is poor, we mean that China's per capita GDP is still low, ranking around 120th in the world. Even if the proportion of education investment reaches the best level of low-income countries—about 4% of GDP—based on the 1988 GDP, the specific amount is only an increase of about 20 billion yuan over the current level of educational investment. When we say "Big Education," we mean that China's educational scale is beyond the world level and does not match our national strength. According to China's level of economic development, the number of middle and primary school students should be between 100 and 110 million, but in reality, it exceeds 180 million. The number of college students is close to that of the United States and the Soviet Union, far exceeds Japan, and is significantly ahead of China's economic strength in the world. With such a poor country to support such a large education system, an increase of 20 billion yuan is indeed not a significant figure. In terms of per capita educational expenses, 20 billion yuan can only increase China's per capita educational expenses from the current 30 yuan to nearly 50 yuan, which is not only far behind the developed countries with per capita educational expenses of over a thousand dollars, but also lags behind the level of some Asian countries or regions in the 1970s.

Therefore, while calling for the government to significantly increase investment, we should also call for families and society to increase their investment in education. Whether compared to other countries in the world or to the needs of China's educational development, China's families' investment in education is low.

In the 1970s, the proportion of residents' educational expenditures to income in developed countries was mostly above 7%, and even India reached 3.3%. According to calculations from some regions in China, in 1987, the educational expenses of urban residents accounted for only 1.1% of their annual income. Over the past decade, the distribution pattern of national income has undergone significant changes. The proportion of state fiscal revenue has decreased from 31.9% in 1979 to about 20% currently, which undoubtedly will limit the increase in the total amount of government educational investment. On the other hand, the proportion of residents' income has shown a year-on-year increase, currently accounting for more than 60% of national income. A portion of the retained earnings of enterprises has also been converted into various forms and names of consumption funds for employees. According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 1988, urban residents' deposits had reached 380.7 billion yuan, equivalent to 11 times the government's educational investment (32 billion yuan) in 1988. The increase from the end of 1987 to the end of 1988 alone was equivalent to more than twice the government's educational investment for that year. Residents' income is the largest part of national income. If, at the same time as the government significantly increases educational investment, each parent can also contribute a little more funds to support our educational cause, the shortage of educational funds will be further alleviated.

"Should Socialist Education Be Free?"
"Socialist education should be free education." This is a deeply rooted idea that people have long held. Indeed, Marx once stated in his works that after the proletariat seizes power, "all children should receive public and free education," emphasizing that in a socialist society built on the basis of fully developed capitalism, it should inherit the excellent achievements of human civilization development, including the free compulsory education produced by capitalist large-scale production. However, education is a highly capital-intensive undertaking. After the proletariat establishes a government, to what extent it can implement fully free education still depends on national strength. In socialist countries with significant differences in national strength, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, for example, have a per capita GDP of over 2,000 dollars, and they can implement fully free education. However, it is difficult for our country, with a per capita income of only over 300 dollars, to do so. Over the past 40 years, we have forced ourselves to do so despite our national strength not being sufficient, resulting in a series of consequences: First, it has led to educational activities being conducted under poor conditions for a long time, with a low student qualification rate. Limited educational investment cannot achieve the expected educational effects, not only delaying the development of children but also delaying the modernization of the motherland. Second, it has caused serious inequality in enjoying national educational subsidies. Due to limited educational funds, the government cannot play a role in adjusting the surplus and deficit of regions, individuals, and families, and can only focus on urban education and university education, which produce talents quickly and have a good foundation, neglecting the support for poor regions and basic education. The "Matthew Effect" in the distribution of educational subsidies is very obvious. On the one hand, individuals and families' educational burdens do not change with the level of education received, the more education received, the more national educational subsidies enjoyed; on the other hand, some families who have the ability to pay part or all of the educational expenses are also enjoying educational subsidies, while some families who truly need assistance cannot get sufficient assistance from the state. A small number of people can go to university and graduate school without spending a penny, while some people cannot even complete primary school due to economic difficulties. Such inequality is rare in the world and also violates our educational principles. Third, it is not conducive to absorbing those educational funds that are scattered in society and among the people, not conducive to expanding the total amount of social educational opportunities, and also difficult to provide diverse education to meet the multi-level needs of the broad masses. If China's educational funds can, under the premise that the government takes the lead, also have the public bear a portion, the situation will improve. When we talk about the public bearing a portion, we first mean appropriately raising the standards for tuition and miscellaneous fees for compulsory education and above.

Should Compulsory Education Be Free?
Then, should the public also bear some of the tuition fees for the compulsory education stage, in addition to appropriately raising the standards for miscellaneous fees? I think it is necessary and possible. In such a low-income country as ours, proposing to popularize nine years of compulsory education is an over-ambitious goal. So far, there is no example of popularizing even six years of compulsory education in low-income countries. However, to accelerate China's economic development, we must strive to achieve this goal, which requires everyone from the state to families and the entire society to tighten their belts and invest in education. Therefore, we must have a comprehensive understanding of the connotation of compulsory education. In the past, we usually understood it as two sentences: the state has the obligation to provide education, and citizens have the obligation to send their school-age children to school. In fact, we should add another sentence: every citizen and the entire society have the obligation to provide education. Paying tuition and miscellaneous fees is a way to fulfill this obligation. Of course, to truly popularize compulsory education, it must ultimately be free. However, regions where it is difficult to popularize without being free are mainly old, young, remote, and poor areas. In cities and towns with a per capita income of over 1,000 yuan and a single-child rate of over 90%, there is basically no problem of being unable to afford a few dozen yuan in tuition and miscellaneous fees to support the education of a single child. Due to a lack of funds, the government has long been inadequate in supporting education in old, young, remote, and poor areas. If, in economically developed cities and coastal areas, without exceeding people's economic tolerance, the standards for tuition and miscellaneous fees for the compulsory education stage are appropriately raised, the government can free up some funds to support compulsory education in poor areas. In our economically backward poor country, this is also a way to accelerate the popularization of compulsory education. Moreover, in educational expenses, the main items are construction fees and teachers' salaries, both of which the government has taken over. Some daily learning expenses and miscellaneous expenses are borne by families, which does not affect the overall situation of compulsory education. In the process of popularizing compulsory education, all countries in the world started from semi-free and gradually transitioned to fully free.

"Education Expenses Have Already Been Deducted from My Salary."
"Education expenses have already been deducted from my salary." This view of reality is somewhat simplistic. Indeed, Marx once envisioned that in a socialist society where the means of production are fully public, distribution is conducted after deducting various social welfare expenses, including educational expenses. The value created by various different ownership production units in China, although a portion has entered the state treasury through taxation and become a source of educational funds, can only be said to be a low-level deduction. This can be seen from China's financial difficulties and the huge gap in educational needs. Moreover, our tax system is quite incomplete, and the educational tax has never been universally levied in various industries. In some Western developed countries, such as the United States, the main source of compulsory education funds is property tax. China does not have this tax, but for the prosperity of the nation and to optimize the educational environment for our children, supporting school education through appropriately paying more tuition and miscellaneous fees is something every family can do.

Investing in Extracurricular Education Is Not as Good as Supporting School Education
Now, many parents are willing to invest in extracurricular education but neglect that school is the most basic and primary channel for children to receive education. There is also an account that has not been calculated here. Not long ago, I met an old friend. Her child is in primary school and has poor grades. Every day after school, she has to supervise, check, and tutor, making her miserable. This is not all; during holidays, she has to hire a private tutor, spending a lot of money and effort, but the effect is mediocre. Later, she found out that the child's homeroom teacher is actually very good at teaching, but in recent years, due to dissatisfaction with the school's meager treatment, he has spent most of his energy on part-time jobs to make extra money. This friend sighed, "In the past, I heard that middle and primary schools have little funding for running schools, but it was like watching a fire from the other side of the river, with no personal pain. Now I feel that this is closely related to my interests. Every parent who cares about their child's future should not hesitate to support school education with money and effort."

Since this year, the government has decided to increase educational funds by 5 billion yuan despite tightening expenditures in various areas. This is certainly a good thing. However, this does not mean that the government has no more potential in educational investment. People see that the construction of buildings and halls has not been sufficiently compressed, the feasting and extravagance have not been fundamentally curbed, and a large amount of money has not been used for the right purposes. When it comes to spending money, people always feel uncomfortable. I think that the government's increase in investment and individuals' increase in investment have no sequential relationship. On the one hand, we should call for the government to increase investment through various channels and methods, and on the other hand, all enlightened parents should do their best to support school education. The people of Dongye are right: "Children can't wait."

A poet who once won the Nobel Prize said the following, which we can quote as the conclusion of this article and also to awaken the conscience of decision-makers at all levels, parents, and all sectors of society:

"We can wait for many things we need, but children cannot wait. At this very moment, their bones are forming, their blood is growing, and their senses are developing. For children, our answer cannot be 'tomorrow,' but only 'today'!"

### 家庭能否分担一点教育经费

　　家庭能否分担一点教育经费
　　苗苏菲
    五台山下有个东冶镇，全镇16所中、小学危房面积达86％。有的学校房徒四壁，学生们用砖头、石块、土坯堆当课桌凳，那些不会垒课桌凳的，只好坐在地上听课。
    怎样改变这种落后状况呢？东冶人算了一笔账：靠国家每年一万元的教育基建拨款，改造这16所中、小学得上百年，孩子等不起，山区建设更等不起。于是，他们将眼光转向了自身。这个人均收入才400来元的小镇，在1984—1988年，硬是靠群众集资265万元完成了全镇中、小学的改造。现在全镇中、小学不仅实现了围墙、大门、校舍、操场、课桌凳六配套，有的还实现了阅览室、实验室、图书室、水暖、电六配套。
    像东冶镇这样教育经费奇缺的地区，在全国并非少数，即使是京、津、沪这样的大城市，情况也好不到哪儿去。不过，山里人能算活的账，城里人倒不一定能算活，原因很简单，国家对山里人包得少，他们依赖国家的心理也淡，事事容易把自己摆进去。城里人呢？被国家包惯了，反而不容易把这笔账算活。前不久，听说有的城市经过周密测算准备近期出台的调整中、小学学杂费的方案又撤回了。是不该调整吗？不是。若干年来物价上涨，中、小学学杂费依然沿袭50年代的标准，只剩下一个象征性的外壳，不调不行了。是调整的幅度太大，超越了人们的经济承受能力吗？也不是。每年三四十元，对于人均收入1119元（1988年值）的城市家庭来讲实在算不上大数。那么原因何在呢？据知情人透露，一是政府考虑到物价竞相上涨已经给群众添了不少麻烦，方案上马太快会加重群众负担；二是顾虑家长缺乏心理承受能力。
    撇开物价的因素不论，家庭应该不应该多负担一点教育经费呢？当然应该。教育的受益者固然是国家、民族，但首先和直接的受益者当推家庭和个人。教育不仅能使受教育者提高劳动生产率和创造能力，从而增加个人收入，能使受教育者获得健康、文明、科学的生活方式，为个人、家庭、下一代的幸福奠定基础，还能在物质消费方面减少失误，从而节约许多有形无形的支出。谁获益谁就应当有所投入，这是天经地义的。部分家长之所以对办教育采取了局外人的态度，这同长期以来我国政府对教育采取了大包大揽的政策，同我们教育宣传上的片面有关，也反映出一部分家长对国情还缺乏了解，有些观念也有待变更。
    例如，我国政府教育投资严重不足，本来应该和能够用于教育的钱没有用于教育，这是个谁也无法否认的事实，增加政府对教育的投入，已成为社会各界的一致呼吁；但是有些家长因此而产生了一个错觉，似乎政府教育投资一旦足了，中国的教育事业就能走出谷底，是不是这样呢？也可以来算一笔账。
    “穷国包大教育”带来的难题
    我国的教育国情可以用六个字来概括，叫做“穷国包大教育”。说国穷，是指我国的人均国民生产总值尚低，在世界排行第一百二十几位。教育投资比例即使达到了低收入国家的最好水平——占国民生产总值的4％左右，按1988年的国民生产总值计，其具体数额也不过是在现有的教育投资水平上再增加200来亿元。说“大教育”，是指我国的教育规模是超世界水平的，与我们的国力不相称。按照我国的经济发展程度，我国中、小学在校生应为1至1.1亿，而实际上却超过1.8亿；高校在校生的数目，接近美、苏，大大超过日本，显著领先于我国经济实力在世界中的位次。以如此之穷来包如此之大，增加200来亿元实在算不上可观的数字。以人均教育经费来计算，200来亿元只能将我国人均教育经费从目前的30来元提高到将近50元，这不仅与人均教育经费逾千美元的发达国家无法相比，甚至与亚洲一些国家或地区70年代的水平也有差距。
    因此，在呼吁政府大幅度增加投入的同时，也要呼吁家庭和社会增加对教育的投入。无论是同世界各国相比，还是同我国教育发展的需求相比，我国家庭对教育的投入都是低的。
    70年代，发达国家居民教育支出占收入的比重大都在7％以上，印度也达3.3％，据我国部分地区测算，1987年城市居民教育费支出仅占人均年收入的1.1％。近10年来，国民收入的分配格局已发生了很大的变化，国家财政收入所占的份额由1979年的31.9％下降为目前的20％左右，这对政府教育投资总额的增加无疑会有所限制；而居民收入所占份额则呈逐年上升的趋势，目前约占到国民收入的60％以上。企业留成中的一部分资金，也以各种方式、名目转化为职工的消费基金。据国家统计局统计，1988年底，城镇居民存款已达3807亿元，相当于1988年政府教育投资（320亿元）的11倍，仅1987年底到1988年底这一年的增加额就相当于当年政府教育投资额的2倍多。居民收入是国民收入的最大部分。如果在国家大幅度增加教育投资的同时，每个家长也能多拿出一点资金支持一下我们的教育事业，教育经费的短缺局面就会有进一步的缓解。
    社会主义就该免费教育吗？
      “社会主义教育就应该是免费教育。”这是人们长期以来形成的根深蒂固的观念。不错，马克思确曾在他的著作中表述过，无产阶级夺取政权以后，应该“对一切儿童实行公共的和免费的教育”，其主旨在于指出，在资本主义充分发达基础上建立的社会主义社会，应该继承人类文明发展的优秀成果，其中就包括在资本主义大生产推动下而产生的免费义务教育。但是，教育是一项耗资巨大的事业，无产阶级建立政权以后，能在多大程度上实行全免费教育，还要由国力来定。同是社会主义国家，国力相差悬殊，苏联东欧等一些社会主义国家，人均国民生产总值都在2000美元以上，他们能实行全免费教育，我们这个人均收入才300多美元的穷国就很难办到。40年来，我们在国力不具备的情况下勉强为之，造成了一系列后果：一是导致教育活动长期以来在一种低劣的条件下进行，学生合格率过低，有限的教育投资无法收到预期的教育效果，不仅贻误了孩子的发展，也贻误了祖国的现代化建设；二是造成了人们在享受国家教育补贴方面的严重不均等。由于教育资金有限，政府很难使之起到调节地区、个人和家庭余缺的作用，顾得了出人才快、基础好的城市教育、大学教育，便顾不上对贫困地区和基础教育的资助。“马太效应”在教育补贴的分配方面表现得十分明显。一方面，个人和家庭的教育负担没有随着受教育的程度而变化，受教育越多，享有国家的教育补贴也越多；一方面，一些本来有能力支付部分或大部分教育经费的家庭也在享受着教育补贴，而一些真正需要资助的家庭却得不到国家足够的资助。一小部分人可以一分钱不花读完大学、研究生，一部分人因经济困难连初小也读不完。此种不均等不仅在世界上罕见，也违背了我们的教育原则。三是不利于吸收那些分散在社会上和群众中的那些本来可以转化为教育资金的消费资金，不利于社会教育机会总量的扩大，也难以办出多样化的教育以满足广大群众对教育的多层次需求。如果我国的教育经费能在政府拿大头的前提下，群众也负担一部分，情况就会有所好转。我们讲群众负担一部分，首先是指适当提高义务教育以上阶段的学杂费标准。
    义务教育都由政府出钱吗？
    那么，义务教育阶段除适当提高杂费标准外，群众要不要也负担一点学费呢？我看有必要也有可能。我们这样一个低收入国家，提出普及九年义务教育，目标是过高了。迄今为止，在低收入国家中，连普及六年义务教育的例子也找不到。但是要加快我国经济发展，我们又必须为实现这一目标奋斗，这就需要从国家到家庭及至全社会都来节衣缩食办教育。因此，对于义务教育的内涵，我们必须全面理解。以往，我们通常理解为两句话：国家有办教育的义务，公民有送学龄子女入学的义务。其实应该再加上一句话，每个公民乃至全社会都有办教育的义务。交纳学杂费就是尽义务的一种方式。当然义务教育要真正普及，最终还是要实行免费，但是不免费就难以普及的地区主要是老、少、边、穷地区，在人均收入逾千元、独生子女普及率达90％以上的城镇，基本不存在因为交不起几十元学杂费而无力供独生子女读书的问题。由于资金短缺，长期以来，政府对老、少、边、穷地区教育的资助是很不够的。如果在经济比较发达的城镇、沿海地区，在不超越人们经济承受能力的情况下，适当提高义务教育阶段学杂费的标准，政府就有可能腾出一部分资金，去支援贫困地区的义务教育。在我们这样经济落后的穷国，这也不失为加快普及义务教育的一条途径。况且，在教育经费中，占大头的主要是基建费和教师工资两项，政府将这两项都包下来了，一些日常学习费用和杂务费用由家庭出一部分，也无碍义务教育的大局。世界各国在普及义务教育的过程中，都是从半免费开始，一点一点向全免费过渡的。
    工资中已扣除了教育经费吗？
      “我的工资中已经扣除了教育经费”。这样来看现实的分配未免有点太简单化了。不错，马克思确曾设想在生产资料完全公有化的社会主义社会，分配是在扣除了包括教育经费在内的各项社会公益费用的情况下进行的。我国目前各种不同所有制的生产单位所创造的一部分价值虽然经过税收进入国家财政，成为教育经费的来源，但这也只能说是一种低水平的扣除，从我国财政的拮据状况和教育需求的巨大缺额就可看出。况且，我们的税种相当不完备，教育税始终没有在各行业普遍征收。在西方一些发达国家，如美国，义务教育经费主要来自居民财产税。我国没有这个税种，但是为了民族的昌盛，为了优化我们子女的教育环境，通过适当多缴纳一点学杂费的方式来支援一下学校教育，是每个家庭能够办得到的。
    投资校外教育莫如资助学校教育
    现在，不少家长在校外教育上很舍得投资，却忽视了学校才是子女受教育的最基本、最主要的途径。这中间同样有一笔没算过来的账。不久前，我碰见一位老朋友，她的孩子正在上小学，成绩不大好。每日课后的督促、检查、辅导，搞得她苦不堪言。这还不算，每逢假期，还得请家庭教师，钱不少花，力没少出，效果却平平。后来她得知，孩子的班主任本来是个教学上很有一套的人，只是近几年不满学校的菲薄待遇，心思多半花在兼职捞外快上了。这位朋友感慨地说：“以往听说中、小学办学经费少，总如隔岸观火，无切肤之痛。现在才感到这和自己的利益是息息相关的。每个关心子女前途的家长，都应该不惜钱力支持学校教育。”
    今年以来，政府在紧缩各方面开支的情况下，做出了增加50亿元教育经费的决定。这当然是件大好事。但是，这并不意味着政府在教育投资方面已没有潜力可挖了。人们看到，楼堂馆所建设压缩得还不够彻底，吃喝风、奢侈风也没从根本上刹住，大量资金还没有用到正道上来，掏起钱来心里总是不顺气。我想，政府增加投入和个人增加投入之间是没有先后时序关系的。我们一方面要通过各种方式渠道呼吁政府增加投入，一方面一切有识的家长也要尽己所能资助学校教育。东冶人说得对：“孩子是等不起的。”
    一位曾获得诺贝尔奖金的诗人说过这样一段话，我们不妨引来做为本文的结语，也以此来唤起各级决策者、家长和社会各界的良知：
    “我们需要的许多东西都可以等待，而孩子却不能等待，就在此时此刻他的骨骼在形成，他的血液在生长，他的感官在发育，对孩子来说，我们的回答不能是‘明天’，而只能是今天！”
