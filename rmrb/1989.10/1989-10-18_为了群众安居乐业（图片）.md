The Pingqiao Town Police Station in Xinyang County, Henan Province, has launched a regional investigation and crackdown campaign focusing on bicycle theft. On August 24, the station chief, Tian Yu'an, led 11 officers, bringing their own cooking utensils and tents, to set up camp in Xindian Village, where bicycle theft and fencing are most rampant. They not only propagated policies but also searched for clues, following leads to solve cases. So far, they have solved 112 cases, recovered over 120 bicycles, and some criminals have surrendered themselves.
