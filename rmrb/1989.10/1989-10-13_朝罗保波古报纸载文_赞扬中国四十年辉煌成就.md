Newspapers in North Korea, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, and Cuba have published articles praising China's achievements over the past 40 years on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The Rodong Sinmun of North Korea published an editorial on October 1st, stating that although 40 years is a short period in China's long history, the Chinese people, with their spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, have transformed the backward old China into a prosperous socialist new China. This is an unprecedented social transformation compared to the past few centuries.

The editorial, titled "The Forty Years of Victory and Progress of the Chinese People," said that China's remarkable changes in just 40 years are the result of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, adhering to the socialist path. The achievements of the Chinese people have powerfully demonstrated the great superiority and vitality of the socialist system.

The editorial said that after the victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles, further carried out reform and opening up, and implemented the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. The people of North Korea sincerely wish the Chinese people greater achievements in socialist modernization.

The editorial board of Romania's Scînteia published an article titled "The Great Festival Day of Friendly China" on October 1st, saying that in the 40 years since liberation, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have achieved profound revolutionary changes in politics, economy, and social life. The Chinese people, with their hard work, selfless dedication, and passionate labor, have completely changed the face of the country.

The article said that the People's Republic of China plays a crucial role in the world's political life, in promoting the cause of independence and freedom for all peoples, and in the struggle for peace, progress, and cooperation among all peoples.

Bulgaria's Otechestven Front newspaper published an article on September 29th, praising the rapid development of economic zones such as Shenzhen in China in recent years.

The article, written by the correspondent of the Bulgarian News Agency in Beijing, Tonchev, pointed out that the products produced in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone have high competitiveness and almost all enter the international market. The article also described the tax incentives implemented by the Chinese government for the five special economic zones, which have given the special economic zones the potential for rapid development.

Poland's Polish Press Agency published a signed article on September 29th, saying that in the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has undergone "earth-shaking changes." The article believes that the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has played a huge role in developing the economy, improving people's lives, and making China "a new face." The ten years since this plenary session have been a "decade of vigorous development" in China's modernization construction. Poland's Rzeczpospolita published a commentary on September 30th, pointing out that in the past 40 years, New China has made a "giant leap."

The commentary believes that the recent suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in China is an "internal affair of China," and points out that the domestic situation in China has "gradually returned to normal," and China's foreign contacts have "resumed."

The Granma, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, published an article on September 30th, praising the achievements of the People's Republic of China in socialist construction over the past 40 years.

The article, titled "Overcoming Difficulties," pointed out that since October 1, 1949, the Chinese people, who have broken the shackles of colonialism, have embarked on the road of socialist construction and opened a new chapter in life. In the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have worked hard and overcome various great difficulties.

The article said, "At present, when imperialism is fomenting counter-revolutionary currents in socialist countries, we appreciate the stance of the fraternal Chinese people and the Communist Party of China in defending socialist construction."
