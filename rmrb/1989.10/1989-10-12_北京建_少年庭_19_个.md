Beijing Establishes 19 "Youth Courts"

	People's Daily, Beijing, October 11th -- Reporter Mao Lei reports: Beijing's judicial organs have recently established 19 "Youth Courts" to specifically handle criminal cases involving minors, thereby effectively protecting the legal rights of minors.

	According to statistics, in the first half of this year, minors accounted for 10.6% of the total number of criminals in Beijing, and 16% of youth criminals. This is a decrease of 0.6% and 1.5% respectively compared to the same period last year.

	In judicial practice, judges in the "Youth Courts" of various people's courts in Beijing emphasize the use of educational methods that involve guidance and persuasion to help minors acknowledge their crimes and accept the law. In sentencing, they strictly follow the law and impose lighter penalties.

	The "Youth Courts" established in Beijing strictly adhere to the relevant legal provisions of the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law regarding the protection of minors. For individuals aged 14 and above but under 16, trials are not open to the public. For those aged 16 and above but under 18, trials are generally not open to the public, except for a few cases involving organized crime. If a minor defendant does not have a defense attorney, one is appointed for them by law. During interrogations, court hearings, and trials, the legal guardians of the minor defendant are generally notified to be present.

    北京建“少年庭”19个
    本报北京10月11日讯　记者毛磊报道：北京市审判机关新近建立了19个“少年庭”，专门审理未成年人刑事案件，以切实保护未成年人的合法权益。
    据统计，今年上半年北京市未成年犯占案犯总数的10.6％，占青少年犯的16％，比去年同期未成年犯占案犯总数以及占青少年犯的比例分别下降了0.6％和1.5％。
    在审判实践中，北京各人民法院“少年庭”的法官注重用启发、疏导式的教育方法，促使未成年犯从思想上认罪服法，而在定罪量刑上则依法从轻处理。
    北京市建立的这些“少年庭”，严格按照刑法、刑事诉讼法有关保护未成年人的法律规定，对14周岁以上不满16周岁的人进行审理一律不公开，对16周岁以上不满18周岁的人进行审理，除极少数集团犯罪中的罪犯以外，也不公开；未成年被告人没有委托辩护人的，依法为其指定辩护人；提讯、开庭、审判时，一般都通知未成年被告人的法定代理人到场。
