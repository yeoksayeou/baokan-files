In the scorching summer of August, Tehran, the capital of Iran, which means "warm land" in Persian, is still bustling and busy. Upon entering the city, compared to 10 years ago, our most striking impression is that there are more cars. Various models and colors of large and small cars are always densely packed, flowing endlessly. Every night, countless car lights shine, like strings of diamond necklaces swaying.

Currently, Iran imports very few cars directly; most are assembled in Iran using foreign parts. Although car prices are rising, the number of small cars is increasing. A deputy director of the Islamic Guidance Department responsible for tourism introduced to us that Tehran, with a population of 8 million, has five or six million motor vehicles.

The second striking impression of Tehran is its good roads. As long as the road surface is paved with asphalt, it is smooth and shiny. Even at 40 degrees Celsius, the road surface does not soften. Driving on the highway at high speed, there is no sense of bumpiness.

As is known, Tehran is a city that has just experienced 8 years of war and suffered over a hundred missile attacks. By August 20th of this year, the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq has only been in effect for one year. On the surface, Tehran seems to have returned to the pre-war era. The commercial atmosphere is still strong, with large and small shops everywhere. At night, as long as there is no power outage, the neon lights illuminate the streets, making them bright and dazzling.

However, the memory of the war is still painful.

In the alleys of Tehran, some households still have black banners hanging above their doors. Locals told us that these are "martyr's homes." Sometimes you can see several in a small alley. In the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery in the south of the city, there is a section dedicated to those who died in battle, with countless tombstones inscribed with epitaphs. Every day, people come here to mourn their deceased relatives. To comfort the families of the fallen, the government has built a batch of residential buildings to help them solve their housing problems. But the urgent problems brought by the war are far from just these, such as the shortage of supplies, which is a widely discussed topic among citizens. In Tehran, necessities like rice, meat, eggs, and soap are rationed and supplied in limited quantities, with the shortfall made up by the free market, where prices are very high, and some commodities have risen to tens of times their pre-war prices.

In our interactions, many Iranian friends confided in us: they hope that the war will not happen again and look forward to the rapid reconstruction of the country. People are happy to see that in the western suburbs of Tehran, apartment buildings are rising one after another. It is said that recently, 6,000 builders have been sent to the border city of Abadan, which was severely damaged by the war.

Our visit to Iran was short, but everywhere we went, we could feel that the Iranian people have a special affection for China. In Tehran, we visited the famous elderly scholar, Dr. Dabir Siyaqi. Upon seeing us, Dr. Dabir Siyaqi was so excited that his face turned red, and his joy was evident. He has visited China several times to teach and, despite his advanced age, traveled to Kashgar and Tashkurgan in Xinjiang to explore the ancient Silk Road, establishing friendships with some members of China's Tajik ethnic group.

In Iran's second-largest city, Isfahan, we visited the Ali Qapu Palace built during the Safavid dynasty (16th to 18th centuries). The main structure of the palace is a six-story building about 53 meters high. There is a viewing platform on the upper floor from which one can overlook the square in front of the palace. The square was once a large polo field where the emperor and his consorts could watch the exciting polo matches from the platform. It reminds one of the mural preserved to this day at the entrance of the tomb of Prince Zhanghuai near Xi'an, which depicts the lively scene of Tang people playing polo on horseback. Polo was introduced to China from Persia and was very popular during the Tang dynasty. This shows how long and close the cultural exchanges between China and Iran have been!

This year in May, Isfahan City and Xi'an City became sister cities. This time, the mayor of Isfahan, Malek Mottaghi, warmly received us. When talking about his recent visit to China, he said that China left a very good impression on him.

The Iranian friends not only showed us great warmth but also spoke very frankly. The deputy chairman of the Iranian Audio-Visual Organization, Shahidi Madab, said he had visited China five times and each time saw great changes in China. He sincerely hopes that China will prosper and become rich, but he does not want to see a China that blindly imitates the West.

We listened carefully to the words of our friends and thought deeply about them. In short, on that ancient land, no matter where we went, we could find something more precious than silk—it is the friendly affection of the Iranian people for the Chinese people.

    八月伊朗行
    李玉琦
    炎夏8月，波斯语意为“暖地”的伊朗首都德黑兰，还是那么喧腾，那么繁忙。一进入这个城市，与10年前相比，我们最突出的感觉是，汽车更多了。街上各种型号和颜色的大、小汽车总是密密麻麻，川流不息。每到夜晚，无数车灯闪耀，犹如一串又一串钻石项链在飘摆。
    目前伊朗直接进口汽车很少，大多是用外国部件在伊朗组装而成。尽管车价不断大涨，小汽车的数量仍有增无已。伊斯兰指导部一位负责旅游事业的副部长向我们介绍说，800万人口的德黑兰现有五六百万辆机动车。
    德黑兰给人的第二个突出印象是道路好。只要是铺了柏油的路面，平整光洁，即使在40摄氏度的高温下，路面也不会软化。驾车在高速公路上飞驰，没有一点颠簸之感。
    众所周知，德黑兰是一座刚刚经历了8年战乱、遭受过百余发导弹袭击的城市。到今年8月20日，两伊停火仅仅一年，从表面上看，德黑兰似乎又回到了战前的时代。商业气氛依旧浓厚，大小商店比比皆是，夜间只要不停电，五光十色的霓虹灯照得大街通明晶亮，让人眼花缭乱。
    然而，关于战争的记忆毕竟是痛苦的。
    在德黑兰的街巷里，有些人家大门上方仍然挂着黑布横幅，当地人告诉我们，那是“烈士之家”。有时在一条小巷里就可见到好几户。在城南的贝黑什特·扎赫拉公墓，有一片专为战场牺牲者划出的墓区，排列着数不清的刻有铭文的墓碑。每天都有人来这里悼念死去的亲友。为了安抚阵亡者的家属，政府专门盖了一批住宅楼以帮助他们解决住房困难。但战争所带来的其他迫切需要解决的问题远不止这些，如物资紧缺就是市民们广泛议论的一大话题。在德黑兰，米、肉、蛋、肥皂等生活必需品凭证限量供应，不足部分则靠自由市场解决，而自由市场价格甚高，有些商品的价格涨到战前的十几倍。
    在交往中，许多伊朗朋友都向我们吐露衷情：希望战争不再发生，盼望国家重建迅速取得成果。人们高兴地看到，在德黑兰西郊，一幢幢、一片片公寓楼正拔地而起。据说最近又有6000名建设者开赴遭受战争严重破坏的边境城市阿巴丹。
    我们访伊的行程虽短，却处处可以感到伊朗人民对中国有一种特殊的感情。在德黑兰，我们去拜访了伊朗著名老学者达比尔·西亚基。达比尔·西亚基博士一见到我们，激动得脸色泛红，喜悦之情溢于言表。他几次来中国讲学，还不顾古稀之年，到新疆喀什和塔什库尔干探访古代丝路，并与我国塔吉克民族的一些成员建立了友谊。
    在伊朗第二大城市伊斯法罕，我们游览了沙法维王朝（公元16世纪至18世纪）时兴建的阿里·卡普皇宫。皇宫主体是一座高约53米的6层建筑。楼上有一观礼台，可俯视宫前广场。广场在古代是个大马球场，帝王后妃们可坐在台上欣赏激动人心的马球比赛。它使人想起了我国西安附近唐代章怀太子墓道口那幅保留至今的壁画。画面描绘了唐人在马上追逐奔突打马球的生动场景。马球从波斯传入中国，在唐代颇为盛行。由此可见，中伊文化交流是多么久远和密切！
    今年5月，伊斯法罕市和西安市结为友好城市。这次伊斯法罕市长马列克·马坦尼亲切接见了我们，在谈到不久前他的中国之行时，他说中国给他留下的印象太美好了。
    伊朗朋友对我们不但热情，而且十分坦率。伊朗声像组织副主席沙希迪·马达卜说他曾5次访华，每次都看到中国有很大变化。他衷心希望中国繁荣、富裕，但不愿看到一个不加区别模仿西方的中国。
    对朋友的话我们认真地听，也认真地思索。总之，在那片古老的土地上，无论我们走到哪里，都能发现有对我们比丝绸更弥足珍贵的东西——那就是伊朗人民对中国人民的友好情谊。
