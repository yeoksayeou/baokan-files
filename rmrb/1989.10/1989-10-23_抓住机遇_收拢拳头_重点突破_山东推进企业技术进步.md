Seize the Opportunity, Concentrate Efforts, Break Through Key Areas: Shandong Promotes Enterprise Technological Advancement

JIANZHOU, JIANAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province is seizing the opportunity provided by the economic rectification and adjustment period to fully utilize the existing assets of enterprises to advance technology, thereby forming a number of pillar industries that drive related sectors.

Shandong is a comprehensive province with both resources and processing industries. It has more than 26,000 industrial enterprises with a fixed asset value of 75 billion yuan, providing a solid foundation and conditions for revitalizing the provincial economy through modern technology. Currently, 60% of the industrial enterprises in the province have been renovated, and 40% of the technical equipment has reached domestic and international advanced levels. More than half of the province's annual increase in industrial output value and taxes is achieved through technological transformation. To push Shandong's economy to a higher level, the provincial Party Committee and government have recently formulated a 10-year overall goal and specific short-term goals for enterprise technological progress.

The 10-year overall goal is: The technological level of major industrial sectors will approach or reach the level of developed countries in the early 1980s, 70% of major industrial products will meet international standards, and more than half of the major consumption indicators will approach the current international advanced level.

In response to the tight situation in various aspects during the rectification and adjustment period, Shandong Province has determined the guiding ideology of "shortening the battle line, concentrating efforts, limited goals, and key breakthroughs." They have started from reality, focusing on the development of 10 major series of products including microcomputers, small program-controlled switches, high-speed fax machines, automobiles, tractors, and numerically controlled precision machine tools; focusing on the promotion of 10 new technologies including steam self-sufficiency in ammonia synthesis production, comprehensive energy-saving in cement rotary kilns, and paper-making energy-saving; focusing on organizing technological breakthroughs in 10 areas including energy development and conservation technology, transportation technology, new products of metal and non-metal materials, and electronic information technology.

While doing a good job in planning, adjusting structure, improving management, and strengthening leadership, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and government have established a dynamic mechanism to promote technological progress. The provincial finance will start from 1990 to appropriately increase the special fund for technological progress in the annual financial budget expenditure; every year, a portion will be allocated from the provincial retained foreign exchange to be used for key technology introduction and digestion and absorption projects; strengthen the overall assessment of technological progress work, outstanding achievements can be evaluated as provincial technological progress advanced enterprises, and the technological progress situation will be used as an important basis for evaluating the performance of enterprise managers and the political achievements of industry management departments.

　　抓住机遇　收拢拳头　重点突破
    山东推进企业技术进步
    本报济南10月22日电　记者贾建舟报道：山东省把治理整顿作为发展工业生产的机遇，充分利用现有企业的存量资产大力推进技术进步，进而形成一批带动相关行业的支柱产业。
    山东是一个资源和加工并行的综合型省份，现有工业企业2.6万多个，固定资产原值750亿元，具备了利用现代技术全面振兴本省经济的基础和条件。目前，全省60％的工业企业已得到改造，按价值计算，40％的技术装备达到了国内外先进水平。全省每年新增的工业产值、利税，有半数以上是靠技术改造实现的。为把山东经济推上一个更高的台阶，省委、省政府最近制定了企业技术进步的10年总体目标和近期具体目标。
    10年总体目标是：工业主要领域的技术装备水平接近或达到发达国家80年代初的水平，70％的主要工业产品质量达到国际标准，主要单耗指标半数以上接近目前国际先进水平。
    针对治理整顿期间各方面都比较吃紧的情况，山东省确定了“缩短战线，收拢拳头，有限目标，重点突破”的指导思想。他们从实际出发，重点发展微机、小型程控交换机、高速传真机、汽车、拖拉机、数控精密机床等10大系列产品；重点推广合成氨生产蒸汽自给、水泥机立窑综合节能、造纸节能等10项新技术；重点组织能源开发与节约技术、交通运输技术、金属材料非金属材料新产品、电子信息技术等十项技术攻关。
    山东省委、省政府在做好制定规划、调整结构、改善管理、加强领导等工作的同时，建立起推进技术进步的动力机制。省财政从1990年开始，在每年财政预算支出中适当增加技术进步专项基金；每年从省级留成外汇中切出一块，安排用于重点引进技术和消化吸收项目；加强对技术进步工作的全面考核，成绩突出的可评为省技术进步先进企业，并把技术进步状况作为考核企业管理者成绩和行业主管部门领导政绩的重要根据。
