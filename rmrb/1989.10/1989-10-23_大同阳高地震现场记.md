The largest earthquake in North China in 13 years

The Datong and Yanggao earthquakes have captured the attention of millions.

This is the strongest destructive earthquake activity in North China since the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, and the first major earthquake in the past 13 years to affect Beijing. The reporter learned from the National Earthquake Bureau's earthquake monitoring room that by 17:00 on October 22, the earthquake zone had experienced a total of 2,016 earthquakes.

At 3:00 AM on October 19, as soon as the earthquake occurred, the reporter rushed to the National Earthquake Bureau's main control room and saw a bustling scene: earthquake analysis and forecasting experts were busy determining the epicenter. The first batch of experts dispatched to the earthquake zone were ready to go, and more people were arriving. Six duty phones were ringing non-stop, with inquiries about the earthquake situation coming from central leaders to ordinary citizens...

After a comprehensive analysis and verification by experts, the National Earthquake Bureau ruled out the possibility of earthquakes occurring simultaneously in other regions with seismic activity, confirming that there was only one earthquake zone, and quickly released the epicenter location.

The Datong and Yanggao areas have important coal production bases in China. The Datong-Qinhuangdao Railway and the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid also pass through the earthquake zone. Nearby are the world-renowned cultural relics, the Yungang Grottoes and the wooden pagoda in Ying County. This further increased people's concern about the earthquake. Three hours after the first earthquake, the reporter followed the first group of vehicles from the National Earthquake Bureau to rush to the epicenter. At the same time, the Shanxi Provincial Earthquake Bureau's team was also heading towards the same destination.

This earthquake had its epicenter just 40 kilometers away from Datong City, with no pre-earthquake warning. Locally, livestock showed abnormal reactions before the earthquake, but the villagers did not think of an earthquake and instead forcibly pulled the restless livestock into the pen and locked them up.

After driving continuously for 9 hours, the reporter arrived with the earthquake experts at several villages in the epicenter area. Every street in the village was covered with several meters of collapsed bricks and soil. Standing on high ground and looking around, the scene was one of ruins, with a few houses that had not collapsed standing alone, the landscape completely changed. What made the villagers even more sad was that most of their property had not been recovered, and the donkeys, sheep, and other livestock that had been forcibly pulled into the pen were also mostly killed. In Datong County's Baozhuang Village, Old Man Liu Fucheng sadly recounted, "My family of six is fine, but all eight of our rooms have collapsed into flat ground. They were just built two years ago, and the TV is also gone..."

In Yanggao County's Qian Guiren Village, villagers described to the reporters that before the earthquake, the village was showing a movie. It was a coincidence that just as the screen sounded with a "bang" of a gunshot, a loud rumbling sound echoed, and the first earthquake followed, "the ground shook up and down, and the strange sound was like heavy rain." The second earthquake was even stronger, and people could not stand, "the houses collapsed with a roar, as if blown down by a strong wind." Since most of the houses collapsed during the second earthquake, people had already run outside by then, so the residents of the earthquake zone were fortunate to escape, with only 15 deaths.

According to statistics, in Datong and Yanggao counties alone, nearly 20,000 houses collapsed. At that time, nearly 30,000 people in Yanggao County were homeless.

At night, the disaster victims set up small shelters in front of their houses or curled up in haystacks, guarding their property buried under the bricks and soil. For the next two days after the earthquake, there was no hot water to drink, and the reporters and disaster victims stood in the cold night wind, swallowing baked flatbread or compressed rations. The few villages in the epicenter have always been relatively poor, but the villagers are simple and warm-hearted. They found a quilt for me and insisted on pulling me into their makeshift shelter in the wild, watching me borrow the faint moonlight to record everything here. Every time they were awakened by aftershocks, they would not forget to take care of me.

Disaster Relief: Timely and Swift

When disaster struck, local governments and grassroots cadres, and Communist Party members played a significant role.

In Yanggao County, a few hours after the earthquake, the county magistrate and deputy magistrates rushed to the most severely affected villages to understand the situation and organize rescue efforts. By dawn, they had already moved the injured to safe areas. Medical teams from various parts of the Yanbei region rushed to the scene overnight, and most of the stores in Yanggao City immediately sent bread, pastries, and noodles to the affected areas. In the following days, every village in the epicenter had government leaders from the region and the county directing the relief efforts. The Yanbei Regional Government issued an order: there must be no cases of people freezing or starving to death, and those who fail to provide relief will be investigated.

Every night, armed police and armed police soldiers patrolled the disaster area, and the public order in the disaster area remained good. Fundraising activities quickly spread throughout the Yanbei region, and large quantities of cotton clothes and quilts were sent to the disaster victims with deep affection. Fuel, gasoline, sacks, mats, steel, wood, and food needed in the disaster area were also transported from all directions.

The People's Liberation Army's certain group army stationed in Datong quickly joined the earthquake relief efforts. From the afternoon of the 19th to the night, more than 1,700 relief soldiers rushed into the earthquake zone before the relief supplies arrived. A young farmer in Baozhuang Village confidently told the reporter, "Hey! I knew the PLA would come!"

The delegation visiting Baozhuang Village all went to visit the village party branch secretary, Liu Jimin, and his family. After the first earthquake, Liu Jimin, who was at work, immediately rushed to the office and used the broadcast to shout for the villagers to quickly get dressed and leave their homes, and not to return. He then, along with the village cadres, checked each household for casualties, but he had no time to care for his own family. When the second strong earthquake struck, Liu Jimin's 87-year-old grandmother and 64-year-old father were unfortunately crushed under the collapsed walls. In Baozhuang Village, 281 households with more than 1,000 people, only Liu Jimin's family had 2 casualties. "Although there were deaths in my family," Secretary Liu said, stroking the coffins of his relatives with tears, "it was only one family, and the entire village still has more than 200 households that need our cadres!"

Experts Gather: Monitoring Earthquake Situation

Monitoring personnel from the National Earthquake Bureau and earthquake bureaus in Shanxi, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia are currently working day and night in the earthquake zone.

Experts analyzed that this earthquake was a moderate to strong earthquake, with a high frequency and intensity, somewhat similar to the 1966 Hebei Xingtai earthquake, but not as strong. Observations show that the thousands of earthquakes in Datong and Yanggao have a relatively small variation in focal depth, and the spatial distribution of the earthquakes is relatively concentrated, indicating that the fault zone where the earthquake occurred has not expanded. Experts judge that there is no sign of a larger earthquake, and the possibility of an earthquake above magnitude 6 is not high.

In recent years, the National Earthquake Bureau has designated key monitoring areas, which have included the Datong and Yanggao earthquake areas every year. Moreover, the analyzed time periods, ranges, and intensities are similar to the actual situation. This indicates that China's mid-term earthquake forecasting level is relatively high.

Additionally, the National Earthquake Analysis and Forecasting Center had previously used geomagnetic methods to designate two time periods: before and after National Day and before and after October 15, when there might be earthquakes in North China, including parts of Northwest China. As a result, on October 5, Tangshan experienced two earthquakes of about magnitude 4; on October 18, the Datong and Yanggao earthquakes occurred. On the morning of October 18, the Shanxi Earthquake Bureau noticed something unusual and held an emergency meeting to discuss, but ultimately did not dare to make a forecast due to insufficient information. Deputy Director Jiang Kequn of the Science and Technology Monitoring Department of the National Earthquake Bureau said at the earthquake site: "We must honestly tell people about the monitoring and forecasting level, and be responsible to the country and the people. The Datong and Yanggao earthquakes have caused great losses to the disaster area, and we must do a good job of monitoring below to minimize the losses to the country and the people."

On the night of October 20, the reporter returned to Beijing by car and saw a series of aftershock records at the Datong Seismological Station. The radio and the earthquake zone were still in close contact, and trucks carrying relief supplies were still rushing through the streets, and relief teams from various places were still heading towards the epicenter...

This is a photo taken at dawn on October 20. Soldiers from a certain group army participating in the earthquake relief arrived at the epicenter area late on the night of the 19th and immediately joined the relief efforts. They set up anti-earthquake tents for the disaster victims who were still camping outdoors and began to clear the rubble and rescue property.

　　大同阳高地震现场记
    本报记者　齐欣
    十三年来华北最大地震
    大同、阳高地震牵动着亿万人的心。
    这是继1976年唐山地震后华北地区发生的最强烈的破坏性地震活动，也是近13年来第一次波及首都北京的强震。记者从国家地震局震情值班室获悉：截至10月22日17时，震区共发生2016次地震。
    10月19日凌晨，地震刚发生，记者赶到国家地震局总值班室，看到一片忙碌景象：地震分析预报专家们正在测定震中，首批派往震区的专家已整装待命，更多的人正陆续赶来，六部值班电话机片刻不停，从中央领导同志到普通市民纷纷询问震情……
    经专家综合分析核对，国家地震局排除了其它有震感地区同时发生地震的可能，认定发震地区只有一个，并迅速公布震中位置。
    大同、阳高附近有我国重要的煤炭生产基地，大秦铁路和京津唐电网线路也穿越震区，附近还有世界闻名的重要文物古迹——云冈石窟和应县木塔。这更增加了人们对地震的关注。首次地震发生3个小时后，记者随国家地震局的第一批车队紧急奔赴震中地区。这时，山西省地震局的车队也向同一目标开进。
    此次地震，震中距大同市区仅40余公里，没有临震预报。当地牲畜震前有异常反应，但乡民们未往地震上想，反将躁动不安的牲口硬拽进圈中反锁。
    连续奔驰9小时后，记者随地震专家来到震中地区的几个村庄。只见村内的每条街道都被几米厚的倒塌下来的砖土覆盖，站在高处举目四望，一片残垣断壁之中，少数没有坍塌的房屋孑然而立，景物全非。令老乡尤为伤心的是，大部分财产都未挖出，被强拉进圈的驴、羊等家畜也多被压死。在大同县堡村，刘富成老人悲伤地诉说：“家里的六口人还好，但八间房全倒成了平片儿了，那都是刚盖没两年的，电视机也没了……”
    在阳高县前贵仁村，村民向记者们描述说，震前村里在放映电影，说来也巧，正当银幕上响起“当”的一声枪声，耳畔轰隆隆地声大作，第一次地震随之而来，“地面上下抖动，那怪声就像下大雨。”第二次地震更强烈，人都站不住，“房子呼呼倒下，像被大风吹的一样”。因为房屋大多是在第二次地震时坍塌的，此时人们多已跑到外边，所以震区居民幸得脱身，只有15人死亡。
    据统计，仅大同、阳高两县，就有近两万间房屋倒塌。阳高县当时无家可归者近3万人。
    入夜，灾民们在房前屋后搭起小棚或蜷曲在草垛中，看守着埋在砖土中的家产。由于地震后的两天内还喝不上热水，记者和灾民们站在黑夜里迎着寒风吞咽烤饼或压缩干粮。震中的几个乡村历来生活比较贫困，但乡亲们性格质朴、热情，他们为我找来棉被，硬是拉进他们搭在野外的窝棚，静观我借微弱的月光记下这里感人的一切。每当他们被一次次余震震醒，总不忘关照我。
    抗震救灾　及时迅速
    灾难降临，当地政府和基层干部、共产党员起了极大的作用。
    在阳高县，地震发生后几个小时，县长、副县长就赶到灾情最重的村子，了解震情并组织救护，天亮时已把受伤群众转移到安全地带。各路医疗队从雁北地区各地星夜兼程赶来，阳高县城大部分商店内的面包、糕点和挂面也立即运去。在随后的几天内，震中的每一个村子都有来自地区和县的政府领导指挥救灾。雁北地区行署向当地发出命令说：决不能发生冻死、饿死人的现象，救灾不力者将被查办。
    每到入夜，持枪的公安和武警战士在灾区往返巡逻，灾区治安秩序一直良好。群众性的募捐活动在雁北地区迅速展开，大批棉衣、棉被带着深情厚意被送到灾民手里。灾区所需的柴油、汽油、麻袋、苇席、钢材、木材和食品等也从四面八方源源运来。
    驻大同的人民解放军某集团军以军人的作风迅速投入抗震救灾。从19日下午至夜间，1700余名救灾官兵抢在救灾物资到达之前进入震区。堡村的一位年轻农民看着从眼前驰过的军车自信地对记者说：“嘿！我就猜解放军准会来！”
    去堡村的慰问团，都要赶去慰问村党支部书记刘继明一家。第一次地震后，正在工作的刘继明立刻赶到办公室，用广播呼喊乡民立即穿衣出房，不准回屋。随后又和村干部一家一家地察看有无遇难者，但他却无暇顾及自家。待到第二次强震袭来，刘继明87岁的奶奶和64岁的父亲不幸被压在坍倒的墙下。堡村281户人家，1000余口人，只有刘继明家2人遇难。“我家里虽然死人了，”刘书记抚着亲人的棺木垂泪说，“但毕竟只是一家，全村还有200多户人要用得着我们干部呢！”他仍在为乡亲们奔忙着。
    专家云集　监视震情
    来自国家地震局和山西、河北、内蒙古等地震局的监测人员目前正日夜工作在震区。
    专家们分析说：此次地震属中强震，发震的频度、强度都较高，有点类似1966年3月的河北邢台地震，但强度不及。观测表明，大同、阳高地震的上千次震情，震源深度变化不大，地震空间分布比较集中，这表明发生地震的断裂带没有新的扩展。专家们判断，还看不出有更大的震情，发生六级以上地震的可能性不大。
    国家地震局近几年划定的重点监视区内，每年都包括大同、阳高地震所在地区，而且，所分析的时间段、范围与强度都和已发生情况相似。这表明，我国对地震的中期预报水平是较高的。
    另外，国家地震分析预报中心曾于9月用地磁方法划定了两个时间段：国庆节前后和10月15日前后在华北包括一部分西北地区可能会有震情。结果，10月5日，唐山发生了两次四级左右地震；10月18日又发生了大同、阳高地震。10月18日上午，山西地震局发觉情况有异，曾召开紧急会议磋商，但终因掌握情况太少而未敢下决心预报。国家地震局科技监测司蒋克训副司长在地震现场说：“我们要把监测预报水平如实地告诉人们，要对国家和人民负责任。大同、阳高地震已使灾区受到了巨大损失，我们要把下面的监测做好，尽量使国家和人民损失少一些。”
    10月20日夜，记者乘车返京，在大同地震台又看到一连串的余震记录，电台和震区还在紧张地联络，街上运送救灾物资的汽车还在飞驰，来自各地的抗震救灾队伍仍在向震中奔进……（附图片）
    这是10月20日清晨拍到的照片。参加抗震救灾的某集团军官兵于19日深夜赶到震中地区后，立即投入了抗灾战斗。他们为仍露营野外的灾民搭起抗震棚，并开始清理废墟抢挖财产。
