In 1943, during the season when osmanthus flowers were in full bloom, the renowned artist Xu Beihong and his female assistant, Liao Jingwen, were riding in a covered horse-drawn carriage on a smooth road.

The master of horse painting naturally had a fondness for horses. Being with horses, hearing the clopping of hooves, and seeing the mane fluttering, Xu Beihong found it a beautiful experience. His heart seemed to gallop with the horses.

"Grandpa, you've taken good care of your horse!" Xu Beihong complimented the old coachman with white hair.

"You have to love it to take care of a horse!" the coachman proudly replied. "Don't just see it as an animal. It understands everything. For example, today I picked up passengers like you, and it's happier than I am. The old horse and I depend on each other. Sometimes, I go hungry to feed it; I endure the cold to keep it warm..."

"Well said, well said! I like people who treat horses well! Horses are both hardworking and loyal."

Thus, as if meeting an old friend after a long journey, the old coachman opened up to Xu Beihong—about the burdens of his family, the disasters of war, the soaring prices, and the hardships of life. The horse ran on, ears perked up, as if listening to its owner's words.

They arrived at the beautiful Guiyuan. Xu Beihong paid the fare and patted the old horse's back affectionately, saying, "Thank you!" Then, he took out a folded "Galloping Horse" painting from his bag and gave it to the coachman.

When the old coachman was puzzled, little Liao quickly added, "Grandpa, this is a painting, a gift for you. Grandpa, this painting is worth much more than your fare, so don't give it away casually!"

The old coachman's deep wrinkles were filled with smiles: "Haha, thank you! Thank you! I've met kind people! No wonder a magpie flew to my window this morning..."

After saying goodbye to the coachman, little Liao asked, "Sir, why did you suddenly give a painting to an unknown coachman? Isn't that a bit too generous?"

"Not at all, not at all! Because I love horses, and I love those who treat horses well. His love for the horse touched my heart..."

    徐悲鸿与马夫
    李卉
    一九四三年，正是桂花飘香的季节，著名艺术大师徐悲鸿和女助手廖静文乘坐一辆带篷马车，奔驰在平坦的公路上。
    画马名师对马自然有一种偏爱，和马在一起，听马蹄得得，看马鬃抖抖，徐悲鸿觉得是一种美的享受，心，仿佛与马一同驰骋。
    “老大爷，您这马养得真不错呵！”徐悲鸿对满头白发的马车夫赞道。
    “养马，你必须爱它！”马车夫十分得意，“不要光看它是畜牲，其实，它什么都懂。比如说，今天我拉上了你们，有了生意，它比我还快活。我和老马，相依为命。有时，我自己挨饿，也要喂饱它；我自己冻着，也不能让它受冻……”
    “说得好，说得好！我就喜欢你这样待马好的人！马，是又勤劳又忠实的。”
    于是，好像千里逢故人，老车夫尽情地向徐悲鸿打开了话匣子——家庭的负担，战争的灾难，物价的暴涨，生活的艰辛……马儿一边跑，一边竖起耳朵，像在倾听主人诉说。
    美丽的桂府到了。徐悲鸿付过车钱，伸手抚着老马的脊背，亲切地说：“谢谢您！”接着，又从提包里取出一幅折叠起来的“奔马”送给了马车夫。
    当老马夫疑惑不解时，小廖忙补充说：“老大爷，这是一幅画，是送给您的。大爷，这张画的价钱比您这趟车钱要多得多呵，您可不要随便给人呀！”
    老马夫深深的皱纹里都飘起了微笑：“呵呵，谢谢！谢谢！我碰到好人了！怪不得今早一只喜鹊飞到我的窗子上……”
    跟马夫道了“再见”后，小廖问：“先生，您为什么突然要给一位不相识的马夫一幅画呢？您是否有点过份慷慨了？”
      “不过份，不过份！因为我爱马，更爱善待马的人，他对马的爱打动了我的心……”
