The head of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security answered questions from reporters today regarding a major international financial case that occurred in Beijing in February this year and the reports in Taiwan newspapers about people smuggling guns from the mainland to Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th - The head of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security today answered questions from our reporters regarding a major international financial case that occurred in February this year at the Beijing branch of the Bank of China and the reports in Taiwan newspapers about people smuggling guns from the mainland to Taiwan.

Reporter: In February 1989, a criminal gang in collusion with overseas criminals stole bank drafts from the Beijing branch of the Bank of China and withdrew a large sum of money in an international financial crime. It is said that the main culprit, Wu DaPeng, was arrested by the Taiwan police. Can you talk about this situation?

Answer: On February 23, 1989, four bank drafts totaling $3.34 million were stolen from the Lidu branch of the Beijing branch of the Bank of China. Among them, the first draft was transferred by the Taiwan-based San You Trust Company from the Swiss Bank Corporation in Zurich, amounting to $875,230. The remaining three drafts were stopped in time by the overseas branches of the Bank of China. The main culprit, Wu DaPeng, a 28-year-old male, was originally a clerk at the Lidu branch of the Beijing branch of the Bank of China, and fled after the crime.

For this major case of stealing bank drafts and withdrawing large sums of money, our public security organs and the Bank of China actively carried out the investigation and recovery of the stolen money. The Chinese National Central Bureau of Interpol issued a red notice for Wu DaPeng through the Interpol General Secretariat and reported the case to the police in 12 member countries (regions), including Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and the United States, as well as the Taiwan police, and obtained their active cooperation. In mid-March, the Chinese National Central Bureau of Interpol, through the overseas branches of the Bank of China and relevant national police, found that the $870,000 that had been withdrawn was transferred multiple times and deposited into the account of the Taiwan Commercial Guarantee Trust Company at the ANZ Bank in Singapore. On March 22, the Bank of China filed a civil lawsuit in Singapore, and the court froze the aforementioned funds at the ANZ Bank. On August 19, the Bank of China won the lawsuit in Singapore, and the stolen draft of $870,000 was returned to the Bank of China. After Wu DaPeng fled to Taiwan, the Taiwan police, based on the red notice issued by Interpol, arrested Wu on October 10 this year.

For criminal cases involving both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the Ministry of Public Security and its subordinate Chinese National Central Bureau advocate that the mainland and Taiwan police should strengthen cooperation and not allow criminals to use the current situation to evade legal prosecution. In April this year, we proactively arranged for the transfer of the Taiwan murder suspect Yang Mingzong, who had fled to the mainland, to the Taiwan police for handling. For the Wu DaPeng case, we hope that the Taiwan authorities will cooperate and handle it appropriately.

Reporter: Recently, Taiwan newspapers have repeatedly reported that criminals are smuggling guns from the mainland to Taiwan. What is your opinion on this?

Answer: The Chinese government's attitude towards the crime of smuggling and trafficking in firearms has always been clear. The Criminal Law of China and relevant regulations on the management of firearms and ammunition have clear and specific provisions. Anyone who illegally smuggles and traffics in firearms and ammunition will be severely prosecuted according to the law. There are indeed cases of criminals from both sides of the Taiwan Strait smuggling firearms, and we have taken decisive measures to stop and crack down on them. Our public security organs are willing to cooperate with the Taiwan police to combat such serious crimes that endanger social order.

Recently, there has been a view in Taiwan newspapers that the mainland supports and tolerates the "dumping" of black market guns in Taiwan. This accusation is groundless and does not help solve the problem. We believe that the Taiwanese media and the broad masses of Taiwanese compatriots can make analyses and judgments that are not contrary to reason.

　　就吴大鹏盗窃案和所谓大陆纵容向台湾贩枪问题
　　公安部刑侦局负责人答记者问
    新华社北京10月26日电　公安部刑侦局负责人今天就今年2月发生在北京的一起国际金融大案和台湾报纸报道有人从大陆贩运枪支到台湾两个问题，回答了本社记者的提问。
    记者问：1989年2月，中国银行北京分行发生一起犯罪分子与境外犯罪集团相勾结盗窃汇票提取巨款的国际金融大案。听说此案主犯吴大鹏在台湾被台湾警方抓获。你能否谈谈这方面情况？
    答：今年2月23日中国银行北京分行丽都分理处发现四张汇票被盗，总价值334万美元。其中第一张汇票被台湾三友信托公司从瑞士苏黎世第一劝业银行转走875230美元。其余3张汇票因及时发现被中国银行海外分行分别止付。此案主犯吴大鹏，男，28岁，原为中国银行北京分行丽都分理处业务员，于作案后外逃。
    对这起盗窃银行汇票提取巨款的重大案件，我公安机关和中国银行积极开展查缉和追缴赃款的工作。国际刑警中国国家中心局通过国际刑警组织总部对吴大鹏发出了红色通缉令，并向新加坡、香港、瑞士、美国等12个成员国（地区）警方，以及台湾警方通报了案情，并得到了他们的积极协作。3月中旬，我国际刑警中国国家中心局通过中国银行海外分行和有关国家警方的渠道，查明被提取的87万多美元在多次转移后，存入新加坡澳新银行的台湾商业保证信托公司帐户。3月22日，中国银行在新加坡提起民事诉讼，法庭冻结了澳新银行的上述款项。8月19日，中国银行在新加坡诉讼中胜诉，被盗汇票87万多美元已划归中国银行。主犯吴大鹏逃到台湾后，台湾警方以国际刑警组织红色通缉令为依据，于今年10月10日将吴犯逮捕。
    对涉及海峡两岸的刑事犯罪案件，公安部及所属中国国家中心局主张，内地和台湾警方应加强合作，不让犯罪分子利用两岸现状以逃避法律追究。今年4月，我们主动设法将逃到内地的台湾杀人案犯杨明宗移交台湾警方处理就是实例。对吴大鹏案，我们希望台湾当局予以协作，做出恰当的处理。
    记者问：最近台湾报纸多次报道：犯罪分子从大陆走私贩运枪支到台湾。对此，你们有何看法？
    答：我国政府对走私贩运枪支犯罪活动的态度历来是明确的。我国刑法和有关枪支弹药管理法规都有明确具体的规定。不论是什么人，凡非法走私贩运枪支弹药的都要依法予以严厉追究。海峡两岸的犯罪分子走私枪支犯罪活动确有存在，我们已经采取了坚决制止和打击的措施。我公安机关愿意同台湾警方合作，以打击这类严重危害社会治安的犯罪活动。
    最近，台湾报上有一种论调，说是大陆支持、纵容向台湾“倾销”黑枪。这种指责毫无根据，根本无助于问题的解决。我们相信台湾舆论界和广大台湾同胞能够作出不悖于常理的分析和判断。
