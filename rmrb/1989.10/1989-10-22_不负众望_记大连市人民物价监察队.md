In the urban and rural markets of Dalian, a new type of price inspection team is active—the People's Price Supervision Team. Last summer, Premier Li Peng, after hearing a report from the city government leaders, said, "This form of price management is very good." Today, this price supervision team has discovered and handled 1,646 cases of disciplinary violations, winning the favor of urban and rural residents.

In the spring of 1988, the people of Dalian, who had just experienced the "Autumn Vegetable Incident," had many complaints about price increases: "Selling 1 jin of coriander for 18 yuan, is that reasonable?" "State-owned department stores sell pork ribs for 1.8 yuan per jin, but street vendors buy them all up and sell them for 2.5 yuan at the door. Is this what price reform is?" One question after another flew into the city government. In a situation where demand exceeds supply, price reform should be managed more strictly, but the number of inspectors in the city price bureau, both urban and rural, was less than 200. After deducting office staff, logistics personnel, and those engaged in national, provincial, and municipal-level professional inspections, the number of people actually inspecting the market for people's daily necessities was very few.

"Price management must be included in the government's important agenda from the perspective of stabilizing society," Mayor Wei Fuhai repeatedly emphasized at a meeting. On July 8, 1988, a People's Price Supervision Team, composed of government functional departments, people's representatives, political consultants, retired cadres, intellectuals, workers, and reporters, was born. Deputy Mayor Gong Mingcheng, who is in charge of financial work, was appointed as the team leader.

As soon as the 200 members of the People's Price Supervision Team took to the field, they focused their inspections on the prices of people's daily necessities. In less than 7 days, more than 300 side dish stores in the city were inspected more than twice.

A customer who had just bought 500 grams of pork was about to put it in her bag when two supervision team members showed their credentials, "Comrade, please let us weigh the meat again." After weighing, it was found to be 200 grams short. The store manager and the salesperson were fined.

During the holidays, the meat counter in the store appeared with "red-crowned cranes," and the supervision team members took out bag after bag of packaged lean meat from under the counter. "How can price management also check this?" The unprepared salespeople were stunned. "This is great! The People's Price Supervision Team is like a guerrilla force, appearing in front of you without warning. Who dares to shortchange or raise prices arbitrarily?" The people clapped their hands in delight.

The serious overspending on medical expenses is a nationwide problem. Enterprises are complaining, and the public is grumbling. The supervision team decided to tackle this issue. In a month and a half, they conducted a comprehensive inspection of the charging situation in 256 state-owned, collective, and joint medical units in the city. How many miles they ran, how many people they investigated, and how many tens of thousands of original documents they checked, even they themselves couldn't say. The result of the inspection was: From January to October last year, some hospitals and pharmaceutical wholesale departments in Dalian sold non-pharmaceutical items at prices 25% higher than stores, totaling over 4.5 million yuan. Among them were 300,000 bottles of honey, 6,000 pairs of colored glasses, more than 600,000 bottles of various wines, as well as camphorwood boxes, electronic quartz clocks, necklaces, clothing, shoes, food, and ginseng royal jelly, oral bee milk, and more than 30 kinds of nutritional supplements.

The People's Price Supervision Team, together with the Municipal Price Bureau, held a public exhibition, which caused a strong reaction in society. A leader from another province, after visiting the exhibition, said, "We also feel that there is a problem with the serious overspending on medical expenses, but we can't find it. The Dalian People's Price Supervision Team is truly amazing!"

Price inspections often give the impression of fining those who violate prices, and some people think, "If you fine me 50 today, I can earn back 100 tomorrow." Repeated inspections and repeated violations, repeated education and no change.

The People's Price Supervision Team has found a cure for this "cancer."

A side dish store repeatedly violated prices, and public opinion was strong. Last year, the supervision team found that they had raised the price of 500 grams of skin-on frozen meat from 2.4 yuan to 2.5 yuan for sale, deciding to fine them and post a notice of criticism at the same time. The black-and-white notice of the violation facts, the names of the store manager and salesperson, and the handling results were posted inside the meat display case for 7 consecutive days. Customers who walked by saw the "Notice" and turned around to leave. The store manager admitted: We are not afraid of fines, but we are afraid of being posted.

The goal of the People's Price Supervision Team is not just to make price violators suffer, but to focus on preventing arbitrary price increases and improper business practices. Over the past year, in addition to daily market inspections, they have launched 10 major campaigns, conducting special inspections on meat, vegetables, daily necessities, cold drinks and pastries, tobacco and alcohol, medical charges, grain store cooked food processing, agricultural production materials, education charges, clothing and hats, and other items. After each campaign, they formulated rectification plans with relevant units. Now, in Dalian, you can often see meat sales points, electronic scales in large and medium-sized stores, rental prices on taxi bodies, and other measures implemented by the municipal government based on their suggestions.

The People's Price Supervision Team has built a bridge connecting the government and the people, further deepening the mutual trust and understanding between the people and the government.

On the first day back to work after the Spring Festival this year, Mayor Wei Fuhai rushed to the People's Price Supervision Team early in the morning to pay his respects. He shook hands with the team members, saying, "Thank you! I represent the municipal government to thank you! I represent all the people of Dalian to thank you! You have not let down the expectations of the entire city!"

　　不负众望
　　——记大连市人民物价监察队
　　刘清敏
    在大连的城乡市场，活跃着一支新型物价检查队伍——人民物价监察队。去年夏天，李鹏总理在大连听了市政府领导汇报后说：“这种管理物价的组织形式很好。”如今，这支物价监察队已发现并处理1646起违纪案件，深受城乡居民的欢迎。
    1988年的春天，刚刚经历了一场“秋菜风波”的大连人民，对物价上涨意见纷纷：“1斤香菜卖到18元，象话吗？”“国营商场卖排骨1.8元1斤，小贩全包了，拿到门口就卖2.5元。难道这就是物价改革？”一个个问号飞进了市政府。在需求大于供给的情况下进行价格改革，管理应该成倍加强，可是市物价局在编的检查员，城乡加在一起不到200人。除去办公室、后勤人员，再除去从事国家、省、市部署的专业大检查人员，真正检查人民生活必需品市场的人员寥寥无几。
    “必须从稳定社会的高度，把物价管理纳入政府重要议事日程。”市长魏富海在办公会议上反复强调。1988年7月8日，一支由政府职能部门与人民代表、政协委员、离休干部、知识分子、工人和记者相结合的人民物价监察队诞生了。主管财经工作的常务副市长宫明程任队长。
    200名人民物价监察队员一上阵，就把检查的重点对准了人民生活必需品的价格。不到7天，全市300多个副食品门市被反复检查了两遍以上。
    一位顾客买了500克猪肉刚要往包里装，两名监察队员出示证件，“同志，请把肉给我们复一下秤。”一称，少200克。门市部主任和营业员被罚款。
    逢年过节，商店的肉案子上出现了“丹顶鹤”，监察队员从案子底下提出一袋袋、一包包装好的瘦肉。“怎么管物价的还检查这个？”毫无提防的营业员们目瞪口呆。“这下可好了！人民物价监察队就像游击队一样，不知什么时候就出现在你面前，看谁还敢短斤缺两，乱涨价！”人民群众高兴地拍手称快。
    医药费严重超支是全国性的问题，企业叫苦不迭，群众怨声载道。监察队决定捅它一下。在一个半月时间里，他们对全市256家国营、集体、联合体等医疗单位的收费情况一一进行了全面大检查。究竟跑了多少路，调查了多少人，查了多少万张原始单据，连他们自己也说不清。检查的结果是：仅从去年1月至10月，大连市一些医院和医药批发部门以高于商店25％的价格推销非药品竟达450万元以上。其中蜂蜜30万瓶，变色眼镜6000余副，各种酒60多万瓶，还有樟木箱、电子石英钟、项链、服装、皮鞋、食品和人参蜂王浆、口服蜂乳等30多种营养滋补品。
    人民物价监察队会同市物价局举办了一次公开展览，引起社会强烈震动。外地一位领导同志参观后说：“我们也感到医药费严重超支有问题，可是查不出来。大连人民物价监察队真了不起！”
    物价检查，给人的印象就是对违价者罚款，有人不以为然：“今天罚我50，明天我能赚回100。”屡查屡犯，屡教不改。
    人民物价监察队开出了治疗这种“癌”症的良“药”。
    一家副食品商店多次违价，群众意见很大。去年监察队又发现他们将每500克2.4元的带皮冻肉提到2.5元出售，决定对其罚款的同时贴通报批评。白纸黑字把违价事实、商店主任和售货员的名字及查处结果贴在了生肉橱窗内，一连7天，走到这里的顾客看了《通报》，转身就走。商店主任服了：我们不怕罚款，就怕贴通报。
    让违价者痛还不是目的，人民物价监察队始终把着眼点放在杜绝乱涨价和经营不正之风上。一年来，除了日常市场检查外，他们先后集中力量打了10个战役，对肉食、蔬菜、日用工业品、冷饮糕点、烟酒、医疗收费、粮店熟食加工，农用生产资料、教育收费、服装鞋帽等进行专门检查。每个战役结束后，都同有关单位制定整改方案。现在，在大连经常可到的分部位销售肉点、大中商店的电子秤、出租汽车车体上的租价……都是市政府采纳他们的建议实行的。
    人民物价监察队架起了一座联系政府和人民的桥梁，进一步加深了人民与政府的相互信任、理解。
    今年春节过后上班的第一天，魏富海市长一大早就赶到人民物价监察队拜年。他紧紧握着队员们的手，连声说：“谢谢你们！我代表市政府感谢你们！代表全市人民感谢你们！你们没有辜负全市人民的期望！”
