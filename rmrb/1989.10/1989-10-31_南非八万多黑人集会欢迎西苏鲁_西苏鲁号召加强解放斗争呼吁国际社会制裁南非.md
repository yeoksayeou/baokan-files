Over 80,000 black South Africans gathered to welcome the former General Secretary of the African National Congress of South Africa, Walter Sisulu, who had just been released from prison.

Sisulu addressed the crowd, stating that the ANC would not unilaterally abandon armed struggle. If the de Klerk government unconditionally released political prisoners and detainees, lifted bans on all political organizations, withdrew troops from black townships, ended the state of emergency, stopped all political trials, and halted executions, the ANC would be prepared to discuss ending hostilities on both sides. However, there were no signs that the government was sincere about negotiations. "All their actions are ambiguous."

He mentioned that the government had discussed racial elections to elect black representatives, which was unacceptable. "What we desire is an election for a legislative assembly chosen by all eligible voters."

He also called on "white brothers and sisters" in leadership positions and officials working in government agencies to join the ANC's struggle for democracy. Sisulu said their responsibility was to strengthen the liberation struggle. He also urged the international community to strengthen sanctions against South Africa.

　　南非八万多黑人集会欢迎西苏鲁
　　西苏鲁号召加强解放斗争呼吁国际社会制裁南非
    本报哈拉雷10月30日电  记者李景卫报道：为欢迎南非非洲人国民大会前总书记西苏鲁获释归来，85000名黑人昨天在索韦托附近的一个足球场举行盛大集会。
    西苏鲁在集会上发表了讲话。他说，南非非洲人国民大会不可能单方面放弃武装斗争。如果德克勒克政府无条件地释放政治犯和被拘留者、对所有政治组织解除禁令、从黑人城镇撤军、结束紧急状态、停止所有的政治审判和处死刑，非国大可以准备讨论停止双方的互相敌对问题。但是，没有迹象表明政府对谈判抱有诚意。“他们的所有言行都是含糊不清的。”
    他说，政府曾谈论种族选举，以推选黑人代表。这是不能接受的。“我们渴望的是由全体有选举权的公民推选的立法议会的选举。”
    他还号召处在领导地位的“白人兄弟和姐妹”以及那些在政府机构中工作的官员参加非国大为争取民主而进行的斗争。西苏鲁说，他们的责任是加强解放斗争。他还呼吁国际社会加强对南非进行制裁。（附图片）
