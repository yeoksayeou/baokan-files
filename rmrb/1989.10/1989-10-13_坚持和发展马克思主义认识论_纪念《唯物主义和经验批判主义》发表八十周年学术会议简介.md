Recently, the Chinese Society for the History of Marxist Philosophy, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Philosophy Association, and the Baotou City Philosophy Association jointly held a symposium to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the publication of Lenin's *Materialism and Empirio-Criticism*.

Participants at the symposium believed that Lenin's *Materialism and Empirio-Criticism* (hereafter referred to as *MEC*) defended the theoretical foundation of the Party's ideological line and upheld and developed Marxist epistemology. This work played an active role in the history of Marxist philosophy, serving as a bridge between the past and the future and correcting errors. It has made indelible historical contributions and holds an important historical position. Of course, *MEC* also bears the marks of its time and has historical limitations. For a long period, due to the influence of dogmatism and personality cult, the theoretical circles excessively praised its achievements and contributions. In the past decade, influenced by Western contemporary philosophy, "Western Marxism," and bourgeois liberalization trends, there has been a tendency to belittle, attack, and even completely deny it. Therefore, the best way to commemorate *MEC* is to uphold the principles of dialectical materialism, and to give a realistic and scientific evaluation of its historical position, theoretical contributions, and shortcomings. The symposium mainly discussed the following two issues.

1. On the Epistemological Thought of *MEC*

Participants unanimously agreed that Lenin's exposition in *MEC* is an inheritance and development of Marx and Engels' epistemological thought. The view that *MEC* remains at the level of old materialism, is a naive and mechanical reflection theory, and is a regression of Marxist epistemology does not accord with the facts and is incorrect. *MEC* discusses dialectical materialist epistemology, which is an active and revolutionary reflection theory. This is evident in the following points:

	1. It upholds the unity of ontology and epistemology, the materialist premise of epistemology, and advocates that reflection theory is the foundation of dialectical materialist epistemology. At the same time, it further develops Engels' theory on the basic problem of philosophy, clearly pointing out that in epistemology there are two basic lines: materialism advocates from matter to sensation and thought, while idealism advocates from thought and sensation to matter.
	2. It follows Marx and Engels' statements on the important role of practice in cognition, clearly proposing to "take the sum total of human practice as the basis of epistemology." It believes that "the standpoint of life, practice, should be the primary and fundamental standpoint of epistemology."
	3. It applies dialectics to epistemology. It emphasizes that in epistemology one should think dialectically, opposing both metaphysical mechanicism and absolutism, as well as relativism and eclecticism.
	4. It upholds the unity of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, the unity of epistemology and historical view, and opposes the revisionists' attempt to replace dialectical materialist epistemology with Machist epistemology and "combine" it with Marxist historical view.
	5. It provides an initial model for establishing a scientific epistemological system that is both dialectical and materialist. These are all contents that old materialist naive reflection theory cannot have, and only dialectical materialist epistemology possesses.

Participants unanimously agreed that the contributions of *MEC* in constructing Marxist epistemology must be fully affirmed, while also realistically pointing out that there are indeed some shortcomings in the book.

Some participants believe that while *MEC* discusses the active role of the subject, it mainly talks about practice as the basis of cognition in the sense of verifying the standard of truth, without emphasizing the significance of practice in changing and creating the world for cognition, nor clearly raising the issue of subjectivity. The error of idealism lies precisely in abstractly exaggerating the active role of the subject, only criticizing it for denying the objectivity of things and cognition, neglecting to explain the significance of the subjective factor in cognition from the perspective of the interaction between subject and object, which affects the persuasiveness of the criticism. In addition, Machist epistemology exaggerates the role of sensory experience, devalues rational cognition, leading to the denial of objective truth, doubting and even denying the existence of objective laws (necessity). Although Lenin points out that cognition should be thought of dialectically, he does not discuss the dialectical relationship between sensory cognition and rational cognition, theory and practice, in response to the characteristics of Machist empiricism, which also affects the thoroughness of the criticism. Some other participants have different views. Some believe that Lenin's discussion of reflection theory emphasizes the dialectical unity of subject and object and does not neglect the issue of subjectivity, such as insisting that consciousness is a function of the human brain is talking about subjectivity; the discussion of freedom and necessity is also about the contradiction between subject and object, talking about the relationship between theory and practice.

2. On the Issue of Philosophical Party Principle

Everyone agreed that clearly proposing that philosophy has a party nature, advocating that Marxist philosophers consciously uphold the party principle in theoretical research and ideological struggle, is a theoretical contribution of Lenin's *MEC*. Currently, correctly understanding and applying Lenin's thought on this is particularly important for upholding and developing Marxism and opposing bourgeois liberalization trends.

Some participants believe that when the extreme leftist trend dominated, the interpretation and application of the philosophical party principle indeed had tendencies of simplification and vulgarization, leading to incorrect criticism of some theoretical issues and hurting comrades, which should be summarized and corrected. However, one should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, going from one extreme to another, and denying the party principle. The key is to correctly understand and apply it. According to Lenin's exposition, philosophy having a party nature includes two points: first, factionalism, and second, class nature. Therefore, as Marxist philosophers, one must consciously implement the party principle, uphold materialism, oppose idealism, and openly declare that Marxist philosophy is the spiritual weapon of the proletarian liberation. Currently, it is to consciously study, propagate, and apply philosophy (including natural view, historical view, epistemology, methodology, and worldview) to oppose bourgeois liberalization and serve the cause of socialist construction and the people.

Some participants believe that correctly implementing the party principle of philosophy requires attention to two distinctions: first, the factionalism in the party principle of philosophy and the class nature in ideology are both connected and distinct. Philosophical advocacy or tendency towards a certain trend or school has both social and historical (including class) roots and cognitive roots, while the background of social class relations affects a person's philosophical views, sometimes directly and simply, sometimes indirectly and complexly, and only by concretely analyzing specific situations can one be in accordance with reality. Second, the party principle in philosophy and the party principle in politics are both connected and distinct. A certain philosophy always consciously or unconsciously serves the politics of a certain class, but it is still distinct from political struggle, the former being a worldview issue, the latter being a class stance issue.

The symposium discussed the issue of intermediate factions and intermediate lines in philosophy. Some participants believe that upholding the party principle requires correctly recognizing and dealing with intermediate factions and intermediate lines. Between materialism and idealism, the two basic factions and two basic lines, there exist numerous and varied intermediate factions, which is a feature of the development of modern and contemporary philosophy. Lenin, in *MEC*, examined the development and changes from classical philosophy to modern philosophy, affirming this fact. At the same time, he pointed out that the intermediate line is not a third basic line that transcends and is superior to materialism and idealism, independently existing, but is an intermediate faction between the two, wavering between the two, and they are a mixture of eclecticism. Lenin mainly exposed Mach's eclecticism and lack of thoroughness in philosophy, and at the same time did not simply equate agnosticism with subjective idealism, but scientifically analyzed their connections and distinctions, which is worth our reference. In addition, according to Lenin's thought, intermediate factions of different proportions in philosophy should be concretely analyzed and treated differently, and should not be simplified.

    坚持和发展马克思主义认识论
    ——纪念《唯物主义和经验批判主义》发表八十周年学术会议简介
    最近，中国马克思主义哲学史学会、内蒙古自治区哲学会、包头市哲学会共同举办了纪念《唯物主义和经验批判主义》发表八十周年学术会议。
    与会学者认为，列宁的《唯物主义和经验批判主义》（以下简称《唯批》）一书，捍卫了党的思想路线的理论基础，坚持和发展了马克思主义认识论。这部著作在马克思主义哲学发展史上起到了承前启后、拨乱反正的积极作用，有着不可磨灭的历史贡献和重要的历史地位。当然，《唯批》也带有时代的烙印和历史的局限性。在很长时期中，由于教条主义和个人迷信的影响，理论界曾过高地颂扬了它的成就和贡献。而最近十年来，由于受西方当代哲学和“西方马克思主义”以及资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，又出现了贬低、攻击甚至全盘否定它的倾向。因此，对《唯批》最好的纪念，就是坚持辩证唯物主义的原则，对它的历史地位、理论贡献以及不足之处作出实事求是的和科学的评价。会议主要讨论了下面两个问题。
    一、关于《唯批》认识论思想
    与会同志一致认为，列宁在《唯批》中的有关阐述是对马克思、恩格斯认识论思想的继承和发展，那种指责《唯批》停留在旧唯物主义水平，是直观的机械的反映论，是对马克思认识论思想的倒退等观点，不符合事实，是错误的。《唯批》论述的是辩证唯物主义认识论，是能动的革命的反映论。表现在以下几点：（一）它坚持本体论和认识论的统一，坚持认识论的唯物主义前提，主张反映论是辩证唯物主义认识论的基础。同时进一步发挥了恩格斯关于哲学基本问题的理论，明确指出在认识论上存在着两条基本路线，即：唯物主义主张从物到感觉、思想，而唯心主义则主张从思想和感觉到物。（二）它遵循马克思和恩格斯有关实践对认识重要作用的论述，明确提出“把人类实践的总和当作认识论的基础”。认为“生活、实践的观点，应该是认识论的首要的和基本的观点。”（三）它把辩证法运用于认识论。强调在认识论上应该辩证地思考，既要反对形而上学机械论和绝对主义，又要反对相对主义和折中主义。（四）它坚持辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的统一，坚持认识论和历史观的统一，反对修正主义者主张用马赫主义认识论取代辩证唯物主义认识论而和马克思主义历史观“结合”的企图。（五）它为建立既辩证又唯物的科学认识论体系提供了一个初步模型。这些都是旧唯物主义直观反映论所不可能有，只有辩证唯物主义认识论才独具的内容。
    与会同志一致认为，对《唯批》在建设马克思主义认识论上的贡献必须充分肯定，同时也应该实事求是地指出书中确有某些不足之处。
    一些同志认为，《唯批》对主体能动的方面，虽也讲了实践是认识的基础，但主要还是从检验真理标准意义上讲的，没有突出实践改变、创造世界对认识的意义，也没有明确提出主体性问题。而唯心主义的错误恰恰在于抽象地夸大主体能动的方面，只批判它否定事物和认识的客观性，忽视从主客体的双向作用去阐明主体因素对认识的意义，就影响了批判的说服力。此外，马赫主义认识论夸大感觉经验的作用，贬低理性认识，导致否定客观真理，怀疑以至否定客观规律（必然性）的存在。列宁虽指出对认识应辩证思考，但没有针对马赫主义经验论的特点，论述感性认识和理性认识、理论和实践的辩证关系，这也影响了批判的彻底性。另一些同志有不同看法。有的同志认为列宁讲反映论强调主客体的辩证统一，并不忽视主体性问题，如坚持意识是人脑的机能就是讲的主体性；有关自由和必然的论述也是讲主客体矛盾，讲理论和实践的关系。
    二、关于哲学党性原则问题
    大家一致认为，明确提出哲学有党性，主张马克思主义哲学家在理论研究和思想斗争中自觉地坚持党性原则，这是列宁《唯批》在理论上的一个贡献。在当前，正确地领会和运用列宁的这一思想，对于坚持和发展马克思主义，反对资产阶级自由化思潮，尤为重要。
    一些同志认为，以往极左思潮占统治地位时，对哲学党性原则的解释和运用确有简单化、庸俗化的倾向，导致对一些理论问题的错误批判，伤害了同志，对此应当总结教训，坚决纠正。但不能因噎废食，从一个极端走向另一个极端，否定党性原则。问题的关键是正确地理解和运用它。按照列宁的论述，哲学有党性，包含二点内容：其一是派别性，其二是阶级性。所以，作为马克思主义哲学家必须自觉地贯彻党性原则，坚持唯物主义，反对唯心主义，公开申明马克思主义哲学是无产阶级解放的精神武器。在当前就是要自觉地研究、宣传和运用哲学（包括自然观、历史观、认识论、方法论、人生观）反对资产阶级自由化，为社会主义建设事业服务，为人民服务。
    有的同志认为正确贯彻哲学的党性原则要注意两个区别：一是党性中的学术上的派别性和意识形态上的阶级性既有联系又有区别。哲学上主张或倾向某一思潮或学派，既有社会历史（包括阶级）根源，也有认识根源，而社会阶级关系的背景对一个人的哲学观点的影响，有的比较直接、简单，有时则比较间接、复杂，只能对具体情况具体分析，才能合乎实际。二是哲学上的党性和政治上的党性既有联系又有区别。一定的哲学总是自觉不自觉地为一定阶级的政治服务，但它同政治斗争还是有区别的，前者是世界观问题，后者是阶级立场问题。
    会议就哲学上的中间派和中间路线问题展开了讨论。有的同志认为坚持党性原则必须正确认识和对待中间派和中间路线。在唯物主义和唯心主义两个基本派别、两条基本路线之间，存在着大量的、表现各异的中间派，这是近代、现代哲学发展的一个特点。列宁在《唯批》中考察了古典哲学到近代哲学的发展变化，肯定了这一事实。同时指出，中间路线不是超越唯物主义和唯心主义之外、凌驾于两者之上、独立存在的第三条基本路线，而是介于两者之间、动摇于两者之间的中间派，它们是折中主义的混合物。列宁着重揭露了马赫在哲学上的折中主义和不彻底性，同时没有简单地把不可知主义同主观唯心主义划等号，而是科学地分析了它们之间的联系和区别，这是值得我们借鉴的。此外，根据列宁思想，对比例不同的中间派哲学要具体分析，区别对待，也不能简单化。
