Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 28th. Premier Li Peng met with representatives attending the conference of science and technology counselors from Chinese embassies abroad this morning at Zhongnanhai. He said that we must continue to develop international scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation to serve the Four Modernizations.

After hearing a report from a responsible comrade of the State Science and Technology Commission about the conference, Li Peng said that China's overseas science and technology teams are good teams. During the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, everyone, though living abroad, remained loyal to the motherland and withstood various pressures, passing the test.

Li Peng said that the anti-China wave stirred up by some hostile forces in certain Western countries is not accidental. They have never given up their attempts to implement "peaceful evolution" and change China's socialist system. After suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion, our minds are clearer. We must summarize experiences and lessons, which is to grasp two things: one is to push forward reform and opening up, and the other is to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles.

After introducing the domestic political and economic situation to the representatives, Li Peng said that we will soon convene the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party, focusing on studying further rectification and deepening reform issues. The goal is to enable China's national economy to move onto a track of sustained, stable, and coordinated development. Li Peng said that developing the national economy relies on the progress of science and technology. We must further carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, but we will not close the door to the outside world. We will continue to strengthen economic and trade exchanges and scientific and technological cooperation with foreign countries. Li Peng required overseas science and technology personnel to coordinate and cooperate with other overseas personnel, adhere to principles, do more work, and in line with the characteristics of science and technology work, continuously summarize experiences and do a better job.

Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, State Councilor Song Jian, Secretary-General Luo Gan, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen attended the meeting.

　　李鹏会见驻外使馆科技参赞时说
　　我继续发展国际科技合作
    新华社北京10月28日电　国务院总理李鹏今天上午在中南海会见出席驻外使馆科技参赞会议的代表时说，我们要继续发展国际科学技术的交流与合作，为四化建设服务。
    李鹏在听取了国家科委负责同志关于会议的情况汇报后说，我国驻外科技队伍是一支好的队伍，在北京发生反革命暴乱时，大家身居国外，心向祖国，顶住了各种压力，经受住了考验。
    李鹏说，西方某些国家的某些敌对势力掀起一股反华浪潮不是偶然的，他们从来没有放弃对中国实行“和平演变”，改变中国社会主义制度的企图。经过平息这场反革命暴乱，使我们头脑更清醒了，我们要总结经验教训，这就是要两手抓，一手抓改革开放，一手抓坚持四项基本原则。
    在向代表们介绍了国内政治经济形势以后，李鹏说，我们不久将召开党的十三届五中全会，着重研究进一步治理整顿和深化改革问题，目的是为了使我国国民经济能够走上持续稳定协调发展的轨道。李鹏说，发展国民经济要依靠科学技术的进步，我们要进一步发扬自力更生的精神，同时也不闭关自守，我们仍将继续加强与国外的经济贸易和科学技术的交流与合作。李鹏要求驻外科技人员与其他驻外人员协调配合，坚持原则，多做工作，结合科技工作的特点，不断总结经验，把工作做得更好。
    国务院副总理吴学谦、国务委员宋健、秘书长罗干、外交部长钱其琛等参加了会见。
