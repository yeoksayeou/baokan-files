The Qing Western Tombs is a vast and typical group of ancient Qing Dynasty buildings. Each individual structure is adorned with carved auspicious patterns, making the entire tomb area resemble a museum of sculptural art.

The ancient buildings of the Qing Western Tombs are constructed from tiles, wood, bricks, and stones. Among all the sculptures, there are wood carvings, stone carvings, brick carvings, and tile carvings. Each sculpture is installed in different parts of the buildings, each with specific meanings, practical uses, and decorative functions.

In front of the grand red gate of the Qing Western Tombs, there are three towering stone archways. The archways are carved from green and white marble. The tops of the archways are crafted with tile and wood techniques, featuring ridgepoles, animal heads, tile ridges, hooks, brackets, and beams. On either side of the beams, there are supporting stones, and on top of these stones are carved reclining beasts known as "Bixie," which ward off evil. On the front of the supporting stones, dragons, phoenixes, lions, and qilin are carved. The dragons dance in the clouds, the golden phoenixes soar through the skies, the lions chase after embroidered balls in a graceful dance, and the qilin stand under the paulownia trees, stretching their necks to roar. These scenes are full of life and intricately detailed. In front of the grand red gate, there are two stone beasts known as "Xiezhi." Beneath them are bases carved with various patterns, resembling square cushions placed on seats. The Xiezhi resemble qilin, covered in scales, with raised heads and tails, appearing majestic and brave. On the stone altars of each tomb, there are many exquisite auspicious patterns, generally divided into eight immortals, eight treasures (also known as eight auspicious symbols), eight musical instruments, and miscellaneous treasures. The eight treasures refer to the wheel, conch shell, umbrella, canopy, flower, vase, fish, and endless knot. Miscellaneous treasures are those that do not belong to any specific category but exist independently. These treasures are carved on the stone altars and displayed in front of the emperor's tomb, symbolizing that the immortals have permanently offered the most precious treasures to the emperor. Some sculptures use their homophones to represent auspicious and fortunate patterns. For example, two persimmons are carved first, followed by a carved ruyi scepter, symbolizing everything going as one wishes; a quail is carved next to a flower vase, symbolizing peace and safety; a double fish is carved next to a halberd on a qing, symbolizing abundant blessings. Each set of patterns symbolizes that the deceased emperor not only brought honor and wealth to the Western Paradise but also hoped that his descendants would live in peace and that the country would endure forever.

Among the carved patterns in the Western Tombs, the most numerous are dragons and phoenixes, as well as animals similar to dragons and phoenixes. On the stone bridges and moon-shaped platforms, there are images of dragons dancing and phoenixes facing the sun. On the front walls of the Dragon and Phoenix Gates, there are coiled dragons with open mouths. In front of each Long'en Hall, there are giant dragon and phoenix stones, with dragons and phoenixes playing with pearls and balls amidst swirling clouds. In the Hall of Cypress and Pine of the Mausoleum of the Empress Dowager Longyu, there are thousands of wooden dragon carvings installed on doors, windows, beams, and columns. On the coffin lid of Empress Dowager Longyu, there is a wooden carving depicting a scene with surging waves at the bottom, flowers blooming above the waves, and a phoenix standing on the flowers, ready to take flight. Above the phoenix's head, there are nine Bodhisattva statues sitting cross-legged on lotus flowers with their hands in meditation. The entire scene is carved on a red background with gold powder applied to the recessed lines, with lines as fine as hair, and vivid shapes, symbolizing that Empress Dowager Longyu has ascended to the Buddhist realm.

　　清西陵的雕刻
　　尚洪英
    清西陵是一处规模宏大的典型的清代古建筑群，在每座单体建筑物上，都雕刻着吉祥图案，整个陵区就好像一个雕刻艺术的展览馆。
    清西陵的古建筑均由瓦、木、砖、石构造而成，在所有雕塑品中分木雕、石雕、砖雕、瓦雕，每件雕塑品安装在建筑物的不同部位上，都有一定的寓意、实用价值和装饰作用。
    在清西陵的大红门前，有三座巍峨高大的石牌坊，牌坊周身用青白大理石雕成，牌坊顶部用瓦木结构的手法雕出了殿脊、兽吻、瓦垅、勾滴、斗拱和枋柱，枋柱两边各有一块夹杆石，夹杆石顶部雕有卧兽——辟邪。夹杆石正面分别雕刻着龙、凤、狮子、麒麟。游龙在云海中翻动，金凤在云海中展翅飞翔，雄狮追逐绣球翩翩起舞，麒麟在梧桐树下引颈长鸣，一幅幅画面，生机勃勃，玲珑剔透。蹲立在大红门前的两个石兽名曰獬豸，下面是雕有什锦图案的基座，好像一个方方正正的花格椅垫铺在座位上，两个獬豸状似麒麟，遍身鳞甲，昂首翘尾，真可谓威风凛凛，忠直勇猛。在各陵的石供祭台上，也雕有许多精美的吉祥图案，大致可分为八仙、八宝（也称八吉祥）、八音图以及杂宝四种。八宝是指轮、螺、伞、盖、花、缺、鱼、肠，杂宝则是没有归到哪一类而独立存在的宝物。这些宝物雕刻在石供祭台上，陈列在皇帝墓前，象征着神仙把最珍贵的宝物永久性地献给了皇帝。还有一些雕塑品用其谐音表示吉祥如意的图案。如先雕出两个柿子，再雕一柄如意，表示事事如意；花瓶旁雕一只鹌鹑，表示平平安安；磬上雕戟旁有双鱼，表示吉庆有余。每组图案都象征着死皇帝不仅把荣华富贵带上了西天极乐世界，而且还希望他的后辈平安如意，江山永存。
    在西陵雕刻的图案中，为数最多的是龙凤和类似龙凤的动物。在石桥、月台栏杆上，有游龙飞舞、丹凤朝阳的形象；在龙凤门正面墙壁上，有张牙舞爪的蟠龙；在每个隆恩殿的前面，都有巨大的龙凤石，龙凤在祥云缭绕中戏珠、玩耍。慕陵的楠木殿中，有数以千计的木雕龙分别安装在门窗、雀替、天花藻井、隔扇、梁柱上。隆裕皇后的棺盖上，有一幅木雕画面，画面底部是汹涌的波涛，波涛上面鲜花朵朵，一只凤凰立于鲜花上面，展翅欲飞。凤凰头顶上有九尊合手闭目、盘坐莲花的菩萨像。整个画面朱红底，阴纹中施以金粉，雕刻线条细如发丝，造型生动，象征隆裕皇后已升入佛国。
