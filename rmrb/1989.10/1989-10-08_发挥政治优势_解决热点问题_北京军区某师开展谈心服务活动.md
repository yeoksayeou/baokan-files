    The certain division of the Beijing Military Region has fully leveraged the functional role of political organs and the advantages of ideological and political work. They organized the political departments (sections) of the division and regiments to conduct "Heart-to-Heart Service Activities in 100 Basic-Level Units" within their subordinate units, ensuring that ideological and political work is effectively implemented.

    The "Heart-to-Heart Service Activities in 100 Basic-Level Units" team, composed of relevant personnel from the division and regiment political departments (sections), adheres to the guiding principles of improving the work style of political organs, doing more practical work for the grassroots, and minimizing troubles for the grassroots. They use the "Guidelines for Grassroots Construction" issued by the Military Commission as a basis, with the premise of reflecting on and strengthening ideological and political work. They focus on the most pressing "hot," "difficult," and "doubtful" issues raised by grassroots soldiers and officers, and have launched heart-to-heart service activities across the entire division.

    The service team members have extensively made friends with grassroots soldiers and officers, holding discussions and heart-to-heart talks with each company and platoon. They have collected over 100 issues that are of great concern to grassroots soldiers and officers and have a significant impact on unit construction, such as infringing upon soldiers' interests, officer promotions, education, and voluntary service. These issues have been categorized and made public to increase the transparency of the heart-to-heart service activities.

    The division's political department service team has exposed "difficult" issues and assisted each regiment in addressing them one by one. Each regiment has responded to the "difficult" issues raised by grassroots soldiers and officers. Issues that need to be resolved by specific departments are addressed by the leaders of those departments, while issues that require the division's decision are resolved and handled on the spot by the division's work team.

    发挥政治优势  解决热点问题
    北京军区某师开展谈心服务活动
    本报讯　北京军区某师充分发挥政治机关的职能作用和思想政治工作的优势，组织师团政治机关在所属部队开展“基层百连谈心服务活动”，使思想政治工作落在实处。
    这个师“基层百连谈心服务活动”小组，由师团政治部（处）有关人员参加，本着改进政治机关作风、多为基层办实事、少给基层添麻烦的指导思想，以军委《基层建设纲要》为依据，以反思和加强思想政治工作为前提，以基层官兵反映最强烈的“热点”、“难点”、“疑点”问题为突破口，在全师范围内展开了谈心服务活动。
    服务小组同志广泛同基层官兵交朋友，逐连逐排同官兵座谈、交心通气，搜集基层官兵对部队建设最为关心、反映最为强烈的侵占士兵利益、干部提升、入学、转志愿兵等困扰基层建设的“热点”、“难点”问题100余件，并综合归类，公诸于众，增强谈心服务活动的“透明度”。
    师政治部谈心服务小组通过让“难点”问题“曝光”并协助各团一件一件查处落实。各团对基层官兵反馈的“难点”问题，一一做出答复，该哪个部门解决的，哪个部门领导做出答复；该师里“拍板定案”的，师工作组当场给予解决和处理。　（张邦邦　曹珠）
