The Mayor and My Heart Are Connected

Editor:

In the second quarter of this year, the town's agricultural machinery station said they would issue 400 kilograms of diesel coupons to our village. However, when I went to collect them, the person in charge of this work insisted on including 5 kilograms of metal cleaning agent, priced at 5 yuan per kilogram. Our village has no use for that item, so I flatly refused. To my surprise, that person said, "Without the cleaning agent, you won't get the diesel quota. This is a regulation from the city." I said, "Whether you give it or not doesn't matter; I'll first ask the city if there is such a regulation." With a bit of a try, I wrote a letter to Mayor Wang Zhi Hua of Qingzhou City, explaining the situation and asking why the diesel allocated to farmers for planting grain had to be paired with cleaning agents. I also asked if the city government had such a regulation.

To my surprise, three days later, Mayor Wang made a note on my letter, stating that the city government had no such pairing regulation and that the diesel should be promptly issued to the farmers. Subsequently, the town's agricultural machinery station sent someone to deliver 400 kilograms of diesel coupons to our village. We bought the diesel and quickly started pumping water, and the 600 mu of drought-affected crops in the entire village were irrigated.

Every time I think of this incident, my heart feels warm: the mayor truly has a heart connected with ours.

The practice of using the "higher authorities" as a pretext to extort money from farmers is not uncommon at the grassroots level. This is also a manifestation of some units' improper business and work styles. The masses are sometimes unaware of the true situation, suffer economic losses, and are dissatisfied with the "higher authorities." As a result, some people, for the sake of personal or small group interests, damage the prestige of the Party and the government.

This village party secretary did not believe in superstition. A letter sent to the city government exposed the misdeeds of a few individuals. This spirit of daring to fight against evil winds and bad practices is worth promoting. It is hoped that leaders at all levels can also draw lessons from this. If they do not promptly reply to the voices of the masses when they can, or do not promptly solve problems when they can, the harm caused will not be limited to individuals alone.—Editor

### 市长和俺心连心

    市长和俺心连心
    编辑部：
    今年第二季度，镇农机站说要发给俺村400公斤柴油票。可是，当我去领票时，分管这项工作的同志非要搭配上5公斤金属清洗剂不可，每公斤5元。俺村买那东西没用，我就一口拒绝了。没想到那个同志说：“不要清洗剂，就不给你们柴油指标，这是市里的规定。”我说：“你给不给不要紧，我先问问市里是不是有这个规定。”于是，我怀着试试看的想法给青州市市长王治华写了一封信，说明上述情况，并问拨给农民种粮的柴油为什么要搭配清洗剂？市政府是否有这个规定？
    没想到3天后，王市长在我的来信上作了批示，说是市政府没有搭配的规定，柴油要及时兑现给农民。接着，镇农机站派人给俺村送来了400公斤柴油票。买了柴油，赶快抽水，全村600亩受旱的庄稼浇上了水。
    每当想起这件事，我心里总是热乎乎的：市长真是和俺们心连心啊。

    打着“上级”旗号敲农民竹杠的事，在基层时有发生。这也是一些单位经营作风、工作作风不正的表现之一。群众一时不明真象，经济上吃了哑巴亏，心里则对“上级”不满意。结果是某些人为了个人或小集体的私利，损害了党和政府的威信。
    这位村支部书记不信邪，一封信寄到市政府，使个别人的不轨行为露了底。这种敢于向歪风邪气作斗争的精神值得提倡。希望各级领导也能从中得到启示。如果听到群众的呼声，能及时回复的不及时回复，能马上解决的不马上解决，那受损害的绝不仅仅是个人。——编者
