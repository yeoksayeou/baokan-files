People's Daily reporter Wang Yantian reports: The Ministry of Construction, the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, the Ministry of Labor, the People's Construction Bank of China, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently conducted a joint inspection and summary of 18 enterprises nationwide that are implementing the "Lubuge Project Management Experience."

Deputy Minister of Construction Gan Zhigan believes that promoting the "Lubuge Experience" is a new initiative in the construction field that combines the Four Cardinal Principles with reform and opening up, and is a concrete step in advancing construction system reforms.

The pilot work to promote the "Lubuge Experience" began in June 1987 in 18 large and medium-sized construction enterprises across the country. Over the past two years, the pilot work has achieved some successes and accumulated valuable experience. At the same time, some issues that need to be recognized and addressed have emerged. Gan Zhigan requires that through this inspection, experiences should be carefully summarized, mutual learning should be encouraged, problems should be studied, reforms should be advanced, and a solid foundation should be laid for the continued promotion of the "Lubuge Experience."

    继续推广“鲁布革管理经验”  五部委检查十八家试点企业
    本报讯  记者王彦田报道：建设部、国家体改委、劳动部、中国人民建设银行、国家工商行政管理局五部委，近日联合对全国18家推行“鲁布革工程管理经验”的试点企业进行检查总结。
    建设部副部长干志坚认为，推广“鲁布革经验”是工程建设领域中坚持四项基本原则和改革开放两个基本点有机结合的一项崭新工作，是推进施工体制改革的具体步骤。
    推广“鲁布革经验”的试点工作是1987年6月在国内18家大中型施工企业开始的。两年多来，试点工作取得了一些成绩，积累了很好的经验。同时，也遇到了一些尚待认识和解决的问题。干志坚要求通过这次检查，认真总结经验，相互学习，研究问题，推进改革，为继续推广“鲁布革经验”打下良好基础。
