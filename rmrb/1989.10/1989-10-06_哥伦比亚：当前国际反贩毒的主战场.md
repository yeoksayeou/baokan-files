Colombia is currently engaged in an unprecedented large-scale anti-drug campaign, which has become a prominent event in the Western Hemisphere in recent times. Over the past month, the Colombian government has launched a massive offensive against drug trafficking organizations, which have responded with unrelenting acts of bloodshed and terror. This special war has reached a stalemate. Whether Colombia, as a major exporter of drugs, can achieve victory in this anti-drug campaign has become a focal point of concern in the international fight against drugs.

The main measures of the anti-drug campaign

On August 18, drug trafficking organizations brutally assassinated prominent politician Luis Carlos Galán and others, sparking national outrage and prompting President Virgilio Barco to redouble his efforts to combat the powerful drug trafficking organizations. The main measures taken by the Barco government include: first, deploying large numbers of military and police forces for nationwide raids to severely crack down on drug traffickers, especially internationally known fugitives. Second, seizing the assets of drug trafficking organizations, freezing their bank accounts, and confiscating their property. Third, reinstating the extradition treaty with the United States to hand over major drug traffickers to the U.S. for trial and punishment under U.S. law. Over the past month, the military and police have arrested tens of thousands of suspects, destroyed numerous secret drug laboratories and airstrips used for drug smuggling, seized over 500 properties belonging to drug traffickers, and confiscated large quantities of weapons, ammunition, transportation and communication equipment, and tons of drugs. In early September, Colombia, defying threats of retaliation from drug trafficking organizations, extradited Martín Rodríguez, a financial chief of the Medellín Cartel, to the United States. The Barco government's bold actions and measures have received widespread support and praise from the international community. The U.S. government provided Colombia with $65 million in logistical assistance, and President George H.W. Bush announced a new anti-drug plan on September 5. Colombia's neighboring countries are also actively cooperating.

However, the current situation indicates that this anti-drug campaign has not yet dealt a fatal blow to the drug trafficking organizations. First, none of the ringleaders of the drug trafficking organizations have been captured. Of the 12 major leaders of Colombia's two largest drug trafficking organizations listed by the U.S. Department of Justice, not a single one has been arrested. Secondly, the drug trafficking organizations are still defiant, continuing to cause death and terror. Just a few days after President Barco announced a comprehensive war to eradicate drug trafficking activities, the Medellín Cartel retaliated by declaring that if their demands for negotiations were not met, they would wage war against the government, business community, judiciary, and media. They further threatened that for every person extradited to the United States, they would kill 10 judges. This was followed by a wave of bombings. In Medellín, there were more than 40 bombings in less than 20 days. A leader of a drug trafficking organization boasted that the seizure of their property was merely a business loss, as their main funds were in U.S. banks. Facing this situation, many Colombians have become pessimistic about the government's ability to win this war.

The complex background of drug smuggling

The reasons why Colombia has become a hotspot for international drug smuggling are complex. Indigenous Indians have a long tradition of cultivating coca, but Colombia's role as a major supplier to the international drug market is directly related to the drug problem in the United States.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as the Nixon administration's campaign against heroin use intensified, the demand for marijuana in the U.S. drug market increased, and Mexico, the main producer of marijuana, could not meet this demand. Marijuana smuggling then expanded to Colombia. At the same time, Colombia's foreign exchange reserves declined in the latter half of the 1960s, and the government's strict import controls further stimulated the maritime smuggling of marijuana in exchange for imported goods. By the mid-1970s, several large merchants in Medellín, who were closely involved in marijuana smuggling, began to collaborate on the more profitable cocaine trade. In fact, as a drug, whether marijuana or coca, it was not discovered by Colombian farmers. This should be attributed to a group of "Peace Corps" members from the Kennedy era, who were escaping the Vietnam War and promoted the cultivation of marijuana, teaching locals how to process coca into a further purifiable ointment. In the early 1980s, the "marijuana craze" among American drug users cooled down, and the trendy drug became cocaine. Due to Colombia's convenient geographical location facing the Caribbean Sea, its ability to obtain sufficient raw materials from coca-producing countries like Bolivia and Peru, and the attraction of the massive U.S. drug market, Colombia's drug trafficking organizations' cocaine business grew larger and larger. They gradually monopolized the U.S. drug market. Currently, 80% of the cocaine on the U.S. black market comes from Colombia. From an internal perspective, drug smuggling is highly profitable, and drug dollars flow into Colombia through various channels. Some estimate that drug dollar income can even compare with Colombia's coffee exports. Therefore, the Colombian government has traditionally taken a relatively tolerant attitude toward this illegal dollar. Moreover, drug trafficking organizations bribe and buy off government officials, making Colombia's anti-drug efforts often a mere formality. Additionally, Colombia's drug trafficking organizations have a certain social base, and in their struggle with left-wing guerrillas for rural land, drug trafficking organizations have colluded with some military and police to organize various paramilitary groups, forming a massive terrorist force. It is under this complex domestic and international background that Colombia's drug trafficking forces have become a serious threat to social stability, making it extremely difficult to eradicate them.

The anti-drug campaign unfolding in Colombia has already attracted widespread attention from the international community and is set to further advance the international fight against drugs. However, it must be recognized that under the existing capitalist social conditions, the soil that breeds drug use and trafficking is difficult to change in the short term, and the international fight against drugs can only be a long-term struggle. The Colombian government and people can only gradually achieve victory over the drug trafficking organizations through persistent efforts.

    哥伦比亚：当前国际反贩毒的主战场
    本报记者　朱满庭
    目前，哥伦比亚正在进行的规模空前的反毒战，成为近期西半球突出的大事。一个多月来，哥伦比亚当局对贩毒集团发动了强大攻势，贩毒集团也在不间断地制造流血恐怖事件，顽强地报复和反扑。这场特殊的战争正呈现僵持状态，作为毒品主要输出地的哥伦比亚能否在这场反毒战中取得胜利，已成为国际反毒品斗争中令人关注的焦点。
        反毒战的主要措施
    8月18日，贩毒集团残暴暗杀了著名政治家路易斯·加兰等人，激起了全国人民的义愤，也使巴尔科总统下了更大的决心同势力强大的贩毒集团作斗争。巴尔科政府采取的主要措施有：一、出动大批军队和警察进行全国性围歼，严厉缉捕贩毒分子，特别是国际上知名的要犯。二、抄查贩毒集团的产业，冻结其银行账户，没收充公。三、恢复哥美引渡条约，把重大贩毒犯引渡到美国，接受美国法律的审判和制裁。一个多月来，军警抓获了上万名嫌疑分子，捣毁了许多秘密毒品加工厂和用于毒品走私的机场跑道，抄查并占领了500多处贩毒分子的不动产，缴获了大批武器弹药、运输通讯工具和数以吨计的毒品。9月上旬，哥伦比亚顶着贩毒集团的报复威胁，把麦德林卡特尔中一个负责财务的头目马丁内斯·罗梅罗引渡到了美国。巴尔科政府这种果敢的行动和措施受到国际社会的广泛支持和赞扬。美国政府向哥伦比亚提供了6500万美元的后勤物资援助，布什总统于9月5日发表了新的反毒计划，哥伦比亚的邻国也在积极配合。
              贩毒集团的反扑
    但是，从目前情况看，这场反毒战远未对贩毒集团造成致命打击。首先，贩毒集团中的首恶分子没有一个落网。美国司法部公布的哥伦比亚两大贩毒集团主要头目的12人名单中，尚无一人被捕。其次，贩毒集团的气焰还十分嚣张，不停地制造死亡和恐怖。就在巴尔科总统宣布要进行一场根除贩毒活动的全面战争的几天后，麦德林卡特尔针锋相对宣布，如果不接受他们的和谈要求，就要对政府、企业界、司法界、新闻界全面开战，后来又进一步威胁说，当局向美国每引渡一个人，他们就杀死10个法官。随之而来的就是一连串的爆炸袭击浪潮。在麦德林市，在不到20天的时间内，爆炸事件多达40多起。一个贩毒集团的头子洋洋得意地说，他们的财产被没收，只不过是生意上亏了些本，因为他们的主要资金都在美国的银行里。面对这种形势，不少哥伦比亚人对政府能否打赢这场战争也产生了悲观情绪。
              走私毒品的复杂背景
    哥伦比亚之所以成为国际上走私毒品的热点，原因是非常复杂的。土著印第安人早就有种植古柯的传统，但哥伦比亚成为国际毒品市场的主要供应地却与美国的吸毒问题直接相关。
    60年代末70年代初，随着尼克松政府反对服用海洛因的运动，美国毒品市场对大麻叶的需求日益上升，大麻的主要产地墨西哥也无法满足这种需求，大麻走私便扩展到了哥伦比亚。同时哥伦比亚在60年代后半期外汇储备下降，政府严厉控制进口的政策也进一步刺激了以大麻叶换取进口品的海上走私活动。到70年代中期，麦德林市几家与走私大麻活动关系密切的大商人开始联合起来，从事获利更丰厚的可卡因买卖。事实上，作为毒品，无论是大麻还是古柯都不是哥伦比亚农民发现的。这要“归功”于肯尼迪时代的一批“和平队员”，正是这批逃避越南战争的美国人推动了大麻种植，并教会了当地人把古柯加工成可以进一步提纯的药膏。80年代初，美国瘾君子们的“大麻热”降温，代之而起的时髦品是可卡因。由于哥伦比亚有面临加勒比海的方便地理条件，又可以从玻利维亚、秘鲁等盛产古柯的国家获得充足的原料，特别是在美国的巨大毒品市场的吸引下，哥伦比亚的贩毒集团的可卡因生意越做越大。逐步形成了对美国毒品市场的垄断。目前美国黑市上的可卡因80％来自哥伦比亚。从哥伦比亚内部看，毒品走私获利惊人，毒品美元通过各种渠道流入哥伦比亚，有人估计，毒品美元收入甚至可以与哥伦比亚的咖啡出口收入相比。因此，哥伦比亚当局以往对这种非法美元常采取相当宽容的态度。加之贩毒集团贿赂收买政府官员，哥伦比亚的缉毒工作往往走过场，雨过地皮湿。此外，哥伦比亚贩毒集团在社会中有一定的基础，在与左翼游击队争夺农村地盘的过程中，贩毒集团又与军警中一些人串通，组织了各种准军事组织，形成了一股庞大的恐怖势力。正是在这种复杂的国内外背景下，哥伦比亚的贩毒势力成了危及社会稳定的严重问题，铲除起来自然也非常困难。
    发生在哥伦比亚的这场反毒战业已引起国际社会的广泛重视，势将推动国际反毒品斗争进一步向前发展，但人们还不能不看到，在现存资本主义的社会条件下，滋生吸毒、贩毒的土壤一时难于改变，国际反毒品斗争只能是长期的。哥伦比亚政府和人民也只能在坚持不懈的斗争中才能逐步取得对贩毒集团的胜利。
