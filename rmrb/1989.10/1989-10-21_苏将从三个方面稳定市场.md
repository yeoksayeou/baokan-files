    The Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Abalkin, believes that to solve the problems accumulated in the economic field over the past five to six years, enormous efforts are needed.

    In an interview with the Soviet weekly "Arguments and Facts," he said that to stabilize the market, efforts should be made in three areas: curbing the growth of income; expanding the supply of goods and services; and controlling existing monetary income to prevent it from impacting the market. Additionally, issuing securities, selling housing, expanding cooperative housing construction, and leasing land are also measures that help stabilize the market.

    According to experts, Soviet citizens hold approximately 100 billion rubles in unsecured funds. The inflation rate in the Soviet Union is 8%.

    Abalkin said that the rise in prices and unsecured income have led to inflation. To address the causes of inflation, the Soviet Union has decided to take emergency measures. Starting from October 1 of this year, over the next 15 months, except for the sectors producing consumer goods, if the wage fund in other sectors grows by more than 3%, a progressive tax will be levied on the excess amount.

    He explained that this is not a freeze on residents' labor income. The draft plan for 1990 stipulates that monetary income will increase by 10%, with wages increasing by 5.7%. He said that the progressive tax does not apply to the sectors producing consumer goods, thus benefiting the increase in the production of consumer goods.

　　苏将从三个方面稳定市场
    苏联部长会议副主席阿巴尔金认为，如果要在五、六年内解决过去在经济领域中积累的问题，需要作出巨大的努力。
    他在答苏联《论据与事实》周刊记者问时说，要从三个方面来稳定市场：遏制收入的增长；扩大商品供应和服务业；约束现有的货币收入，不使其冲击市场。另外，发行有价证券、出售住房、扩大合作建房和出租土地等也是有助于稳定市场的一些作法。
    据专家统计，苏联居民手中掌握着缺乏商品保障的资金约一千亿卢布。苏联通货膨胀的指数为百分之八。
    阿巴尔金说，物价上涨和缺乏商品保障的收入导致了通货膨胀。为了对造成通货膨胀的原因施加影响，苏联决定采取紧急措施，从今年十月一日起，在十五个月内除生产消费品的领域外，如果其他部门的工资基金增长超过百分之三，即征收其累进税。
    他解释说，这不是冻结居民的劳动收入，一九九零年的计划草案规定货币收入将增长百分之十，其中工资增长百分之五点七。他说，累进税并不涉及生产消费品的部门，因此有利于增加消费品的生产。
