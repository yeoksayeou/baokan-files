National Land Administration and the Economic Department of this newspaper will jointly host a discussion column titled "How to Cherish Every Inch of Land?" starting today. We welcome contributions from all sectors of society to express their views. The severity of China's arable land issue lies not only in the rapid decrease of arable land and the sharp increase in population, exacerbating the land-people contradiction, but also in the fact that a significant number of people have not truly recognized the serious consequences that the inverse development of arable land and population will bring. There is a lack of crisis awareness and urgency. We need to further sound the alarm in this regard, so that every citizen in the country, including middle and primary school students, understands China's land situation and jointly faces and strives to solve the potential land crisis. This is the purpose of this thematic discussion.

The discussion must be practical and should start from representative issues happening around us. For example, we should explore and study the following problems: Why do phenomena of乱占滥用土地 (disorderly occupation and misuse of land) persist despite long-term prohibitions? What are the reasons why some people turn a blind eye to the waste of land resources? What urgent tasks need to be done to truly cherish and rationally use every inch of land, and effectively protect arable land? We believe that as long as everyone discusses the issues, presents facts, reasons, analyses, and debates, consensus on widely concerned problems will not be difficult to reach. Of course, we also welcome experts and scholars, as well as colleagues who have specialized in land issues, to publish comprehensive and theoretically rich articles.

The State Council promulgated the "Land Management Law" in 1987, bringing China's land management work into the track of legal administration. From the feedback at the grassroots level, merely promulgating laws cannot solve all the problems of legal land management. We hope that through this discussion, we can study more new situations, propose new problems, and accumulate experience for gradually strengthening and improving land management work.

Manuscripts should be concise and have a clear theme. Please send manuscripts and letters to the Economic Department of People's Daily (Postal Code 100733), marked "Land Discussion Manuscript."

　　告读者
    国家土地管理局和本报经济部从今天起共同举办《怎样珍惜每寸土地？》讨论专栏，欢迎各界有识之士踊跃来稿、来信，各抒己见。我国耕地问题的严重性，不仅在于耕地面积锐减，人口猛增，人地矛盾加剧，土地问题已经给我国的经济发展和人民生活带来严重影响，还在于相当多数的人没有真正认识到耕地、人口反向发展导致的土地危机会带来多么严重的后果，没有危机感和紧迫感。我们要在这一方面进一步敲响警钟，使全国每个公民，包括中、小学生都了解我国土地国情，共同正视和努力解决潜在的土地危机问题。这就是我们举办这一次专题讨论的宗旨。
    讨论务必联系实际，多从自己身边发生的有一定代表性的事情出发，探讨研究例如下面这样一些问题：为什么乱占滥用土地现象长期禁而不止？有些人对浪费土地资源视而不见原因何在？十分珍惜和合理利用每寸土地、切实保护耕地有哪些工作急待去做？……我们相信，只要大家在讨论中摆事实，讲道理，有分析，有辩论，对普遍关心的问题不难找到共识。当然，我们也欢迎专家学者、对土地问题有专门研究的同志，发表一些综合性的、理论色彩较强的文章。
    国务院1987年颁布了《土地管理法》，我国的土地管理工作纳入了依法管理的轨道。从基层反映的情况看，仅仅颁布法律，并不能全部解决依法管地的问题，我们很希望通过这次讨论，更多地研究新情况，提出新问题，为逐步加强和完善土地管理工作积累经验。
    来稿要尽量短小精悍，主题鲜明。来稿来信请寄人民日报经济部（邮政编码100733），注明“土地讨论稿”。
