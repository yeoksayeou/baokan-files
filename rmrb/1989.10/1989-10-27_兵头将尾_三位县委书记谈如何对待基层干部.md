In Henan Province, reporters interviewed the county committee secretaries of Gongsun, Yichuan, and Gushi. They all discussed with the reporter the topic of how to correctly treat village cadres. These cadres of village party branches, party small groups, and grassroots village committees and village small groups are active on the frontline of production, life, and grassroots governance, and are the true frontline and rear guard.

"Good Scriptures Still Need Monks to Recite"

Gongsun County County Committee Secretary Yang Zhenhai said: Good scriptures still need monks to recite, "The higher-ups have a thousand lines, the lower levels have one needle." Collecting grain, land, funds, labor, building roads, water conservancy, family planning, all kinds of work rely on village cadres. They neither eat "imperial rations" nor have administrative ranks, and are actually still farmers. They are just more fair, capable, and willing to work for the party and government. Village cadres must be strictly required, but not overly demanded. Although there are some "local tyrants" and "local bullies" among them, the vast majority are good comrades.

Yang Zhenhai said: Many documents of our party and government are marked "issued to county and above," and village cadres generally do not receive them. Some villages do not subscribe to newspapers and do not have radio broadcasts. In this situation, how can village cadres implement the spirit of the central government and complete various tasks? Our method is to invest effort in training village cadres, mainly training village party branch secretaries and village committee directors. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, this work has been more tightly grasped. If village cadres do not understand the central government's line, principles, and policies, even if the monk wants to recite the scriptures, he cannot do so.

"Supporting Their Backs and Bolstering Their Courage"

Yichuan County County Committee Secretary Cui Wei said: In the 1950s, the public security bureau went to the countryside to catch bad guys, and village cadres actively cooperated. But now, some village cadres do not dare to take the lead. This cannot be entirely blamed on them. An important reason is that after they are retaliated against, no one takes care of them. A considerable number of village cadres, because they acted justly and offended people, had their chickens poisoned, their vegetables in the garden pulled out, and bricks thrown into their houses at night, even threatening their personal safety. If this continues, who will dare to work boldly as a village cadre? Therefore, the county committee must support their backs and bolster their courage. Implementing insurance for village cadres is a good measure. The township government pays for it, and the insurance covers houses, livestock, trees, seedlings, property, and personal safety. If village cadres are retaliated against for acting justly, all losses can be compensated.

In addition, Yichuan County implements the method of "gradually stepping down" for replacing village cadres. A village party branch secretary and village committee director who has worked for many years cannot avoid offending a few people. When they are old and cannot work anymore, if they are completely removed, it will be difficult for them to live in the village. It is better to let them serve as deputy secretaries, deputy directors, or committee members for another two years, and then completely step down from the cadre stage. For the age and cultural level of village cadres, it is not a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Some, although older and with less education, have prestige, ability, and good health, and can still work for a few more years.

Cui Wei said: Of course, for village cadres who seriously violate laws and disciplines and oppress the masses, they must be completely removed. Supporting their backs and bolstering their courage is for the majority of good cadres.

"Don't Add Trouble to the Bottom"

Gushi County County Committee Secretary Zhang Shouyin said: "Driving a car around, looking through the glass, eating one meal at noon, and returning with money," this is the criticism of farmers against some cadres going to the countryside. This is not going to the countryside to work; it is going to the countryside to satisfy cravings and to collect local specialties. There are also those who use their power for personal gain, symbolically giving a few yuan, and then asking farmers for a piece of land to build a private house. This makes village cadres very troubled. To do it, it is like cutting flesh; not to do it, they dare not offend. Farmers are even more disgusted and say: Welcome "old Eighth Route Army" to visit, but fear the "eating and drinking team" to enter the village.

Gushi County formulated disciplines around clean governance: Cadres going to the countryside are not allowed to drink alcohol, and must pay for meals. Don't add trouble to the bottom. First, require the county committee standing committee to lead by example in implementing the disciplines. If someone violates them, in addition to paying back the money, they must also make a self-criticism at the life meeting. The county discipline inspection commission checks the accounts every half year and publishes the results. No one is exempt. In this way, the reception fee is reduced, and the burden on farmers is lightened. Taking Wangpeng Township as an example, the reception fee this year in the first half of the year decreased by 38% compared to the same period last year.

Zhang Shouyin said: Village cadres already have enough troubles. If the higher-ups add more, how can they live?

　　兵头将尾
　　——三位县委书记谈如何对待基层干部
　　本报记者　李德民
    在河南省采访了巩县、伊川、固始三县的县委书记，他们都同记者谈到一个话题：如何正确对待村干部。这些村党支部、党小组和基层村民委员会、村民小组的干部，活跃在生产、生活和基层政权第一线，是真正的兵头将尾。
　　“好经还得和尚念”
    巩县县委书记杨振海说：好经还得和尚念，“上头千条线，下头一根针”，征粮、征地、派款、派工、修路、修水利、计划生育，啥事都得靠村干部，而他们一不吃“皇粮”，二无行政级别，实际上还是农民，不过是一些比较公道、能干而又愿意为党和政府做工作的农民。对村干部要严格要求，又不能苛求，他们中虽然有些“土皇帝”、“地头蛇”式人物，但绝大多数是好同志。
    杨振海说：我们党和政府的许多文件，注明“发至县团级”，村干部一般拿不到，有的村没订报纸，不通广播，这种情况下，村干部怎样去贯彻中央精神、完成各项任务？我们的办法是下功夫培训村干部，主要培训村党支部书记和村民委员会主任，在党的十三届四中全会以后，这项工作抓得更紧。如果村干部不了解中央的路线、方针、政策，就是和尚想念经也念不成了。
　　“为他们撑腰壮胆”
    伊川县县委书记崔巍说：50年代公安局下乡抓坏人，村干部主动配合，可现在有些村干部不敢出这个头了。这不能全怪他们，有个重要的原因是他们受到打击报复后没人管。有相当一部分村干部因秉公办事得罪了人，养的鸡被毒死，菜园里的菜被拔掉，夜里有人朝屋里扔砖头，连人身安全都受到威胁。这样下去，村干部谁还敢大胆工作？所以，县委要为他们撑腰壮胆。村干部实行保险是个好措施，由乡政府出钱，办保险保房屋、家畜、树木、青苗、财产、人身等项目。村干部如果因秉公办事受到报复，一切损失可以得到赔偿。
    另外，伊川县撤换村干部实行“逐步下台阶”的办法。一个村党支部书记和村民委员会主任干了多年，不可能不得罪几个人，年纪大了，不能干了，如果一捋到底，在村里很不好做人。最好再让他当两年副支书、副主任或支委、村委，然后再完全走下干部的台阶。对村干部的年龄和文化水平，也不“一刀切”，有些虽然年龄大、文化低，但有威望，有能力，身体好，还可以再干几年。
    崔巍说：当然，对严重违法乱纪、欺压群众的村干部，那就要一捋到底。撑腰壮胆是对大多数好干部而言的。
　　“别给下头添麻烦”
    固始县县委书记张守印说：“坐着汽车转，隔着玻璃看，中午吃一餐，回去还领钱”，这是农民对一些干部下乡的批评。这哪是下乡工作？是下乡解馋，下乡搞土特产。还有的以权谋私，象征性地给几个钱，就要农民一块土地建私房。这种事使村干部十分为难。办吧，是忍痛割肉；不办吧，得罪不起。这种事农民更反感，他们说：欢迎“老八路”登门，害怕“吃喝团”进村。
    固始县围绕着廉政建设制订纪律：干部下乡一律不准喝酒，吃饭要交钱，别给下头添麻烦。首先要求县委常委带头执行纪律，如果有人违犯，除了补交钱，还要在生活会上检讨，县纪委半年查一次帐，公布查帐结果，谁也不能例外。这样一来，招待费减少，农民负担减轻，以汪棚乡为例，今年上半年招待费比去年同期减少38％。
    张守印说：村干部的麻烦事本来就够多了，上头再添麻烦，还叫人家怎么过日子？
