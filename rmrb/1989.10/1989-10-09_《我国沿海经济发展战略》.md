The book "China's Coastal Economic Development Strategy" edited by Wu Dakun and published by the Times Publishing House argues that almost all countries in the world are undergoing adjustments and reforms. A new pattern of international division of labor and industrial structure adjustment is taking shape globally, presenting an opportunity for China to implement its coastal economic development strategy. However, there are also unfavorable factors: China's macroeconomy is not well managed; it is difficult to implement industrial policies that align with both national conditions and international economic development trends; many comrades still do not fully understand the complexity, competitiveness, riskiness, and supply-demand dynamics of the international market. In response, the author proposes feasible policy suggestions.

The book provides an in-depth analysis of the scientific basis for the coastal economic development strategy, the basic models of coastal economic development, the main lessons from the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region and countries, and their relationship with China's economy.

    《我国沿海经济发展战略》
    吴大琨主编　时事出版社出版
    本书认为，世界上几乎所有国家都在进行调整和改革，世界范围的国际分工与产业结构的调整正在形成新的态势，这为我国实施沿海经济发展战略提供了机遇。实施这一战略也存在不利因素：我国的宏观经济尚未管理好；实施既符合国情又符合国际经济发展趋势的产业政策难度较大；不少同志至今对国际市场的复杂性、竞争性、风险性、供求变化的特性认识不足。对此，作者提出了可行性政策建议。
    本书对沿海经济发展战略的科学依据，沿海经济发展的基本模式，亚太地区和国家经济发展的主要教训及其与我国的经济关系，都作了深入的分析。
