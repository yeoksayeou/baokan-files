Underworld organizations spread across Japan are highly active. According to police statistics, in 1988, there were at least 3,200 underground gang-like underworld organizations nationwide, with a total of 86,500 members. These numerous underworld organizations mainly engage in drug trafficking, gambling, and prostitution. They use various means to defraud money. In 1988, Japanese underworld organizations earned $10 billion. Half of this came from traditional illegal activities such as smuggling and drug trafficking, operating gambling dens, etc. In addition, gangsters use illegally obtained funds to invest in legal businesses through covert means, seeking to make huge profits.

In recent years, tightly organized Japanese underworld organizations have actively expanded their influence. They adopt collective and monopolistic strategies to consolidate their positions. So far, the three largest underworld organizations in Japan, through mergers and expansions, have a total of 35,000 members under their control, accounting for 40% of the total number of gangsters in Japan.

In 1988, the Japanese police investigated 1.6 million cases related to underworld organization activities, dealing heavy blows to gangsters. However, some large underworld organizations are beyond the reach of the police.

　　日本黑社会组织活动猖獗
    遍布日本各地的黑社会组织，活动十分猖獗。据警方统计，1988年全日本至少有3200多个地下帮会性质的黑社会组织，成员总数达86500多人。众多的黑社会组织，主要从事贩毒、赌博、色情等行当。它们运用各种手段，诈骗钱财。1988年日本的黑社会组织赚得100亿美元。其中半数来自传统的非法活动，如走私贩毒、开设赌场等。除此之外，黑帮分子还用非法得来的巨款，采取隐蔽手法转而投资合法经营，从中谋取暴利。
    近年来，组织严密的日本黑社会组织积极扩充自己的势力，它们采取集团化与垄断化，以巩固自己的阵地。迄今，日本最大的3个黑社会组织，通过兼并扩充，属下成员已多达35000人，占全日本黑帮成员总数的40％。
    日本警方于1988年间调查了160万件与黑社会组织活动有关的犯罪案，对黑帮分子给予沉重打击，可是一些庞大的黑社会组织活动，警方拿它们也没有多少办法。　伊竹
