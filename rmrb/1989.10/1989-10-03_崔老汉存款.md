In July, the wind in Shanxi's Xiangfen County was cool after the rain. The streets were bustling with people, and the savings hall of the county's Industrial and Commercial Bank was also lively.

An elderly man in his late fifties pushed his way to the savings counter, observing for a long time. This was an old man surnamed Cui from Yandian Village in the county. Recently, he had heard some rumors saying that keeping money in the bank was not as safe or convenient as keeping it at home, and he was unsure. So, he tentatively asked the clerk, "Comrade, can you withdraw money from here anytime you want?" Clerk Wu Xuechan replied enthusiastically, "Old comrade, the state's savings policy is voluntary deposit and free withdrawal. You can withdraw whenever you want. Do you want to deposit money?" Seeing Old Man Cui's skeptical expression, as if he had been wronged somewhere, after a long while, Old Man Cui finally said, "I'll deposit today, and I'll withdraw tomorrow."

"Sure!" Wu Xuechan replied enthusiastically.

Old Man Cui heard this, lifted his clothes, and slowly took out money while saying, "Then I'll deposit 200 yuan."

Wu Xuechan quickly completed the deposit procedure for Old Man Cui.

To his surprise, the next day when she started work, Old Man Cui indeed came to the counter. He carefully took out the deposit slip from yesterday and said, "I want to withdraw money." Clerk Wu Xuechan was puzzled, thinking, "Old Man Cui has such a strange temper! He really came to withdraw the money he deposited yesterday!" What was the reason? Wu Xuechan couldn't figure it out at the moment. But Wu Xuechan was always full of enthusiasm and, without hesitation, completed the withdrawal procedure for Old Man Cui.

Wu Xuechan guessed what Old Man Cui was thinking, and Old Man Cui put away the money. Just as Old Man Cui was about to leave, he suddenly turned back, happily taking out money and saying, "Comrade! I believe you now. I want to deposit 3000 yuan, fixed-term for three years. Please handle the procedure!" Seeing this, Wu Xuechan suddenly understood.

    崔老汉存款
    7月的山西襄汾县，雨后的风很凉爽。街上行人熙熙攘攘，县工商银行礼堂储蓄所里也很热闹。
      一位年近六旬的老汉挤到了储蓄所柜台前，观察良久。这是该县阎店村姓崔的老汉。他近来听了一些风言风语，说把钱存在银行里不如放在家里保险方便，心里没了底。于是，他试探着问营业员：“同志，你们这儿存了钱能随便取吗？”营业员吴雪蝉热情地答：“老同志，国家的储蓄政策是存款自愿，取款自由，愿啥时取都行。您老要存钱吗？”小吴看着崔老汉半信半疑的神情，好像在哪儿吃过苦头似的，半晌崔老汉才吐出一句话：“我今天存了，明天就要取。”“行！”小吴热情地回答。
    崔老汉听罢撩起衣角，边掏钱边慢悠悠地说：“那就存200元吧。”
    吴雪蝉很快给崔老汉办了存款手续。
    没想到，第二天刚上班，这位崔老汉果真来到柜台前，他小心翼翼地掏出昨天的存款单，说：“取钱。”营业员吴雪蝉心里怪纳闷，心想：“这崔老汉脾气真怪！昨天存的钱今个儿真的来取！”啥原因，小吴一时还摸不准。但小吴总是满腔热情，毫不打哼唧地给崔老汉办了取款手续。
    小吴捉摸着老汉的心思，崔老汉也装好钱。但见老汉前脚刚迈出门，又突然转身高兴地边掏钱边说：
    “同志！我相信你们了，我要存3000元钱，定期三年，请办手续！”小吴见此情景，心里恍然大悟。
