An 82-year-old housewife traveled from Japan to the green forest of western Hubei, China, where she tightly embraced a metasequoia tree. She stretched her arms as far as she could, but could only wrap around a single branch. She then stroked the tree trunk, unable to hold back her tears...

This tree is known as the "World's Grandfather." Metasequoia first appeared in the Arctic Circle about 130 million years ago. Later, during the mid-Cenozoic era, due to changes in climate and geology, metasequoia spread to Europe, Asia, and North America. Subsequently, during the fourth glacial period, metasequoia nearly became extinct, with only a few surviving in areas of China, such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan, that were not severely affected by the glaciers. For a long time, like in Europe and America, people only knew of metasequoia from fossils unearthed from the ground, unaware that living metasequoia silently existed in the mountains. In 1941, a professor in China first discovered a large metasequoia in Xiduo Creek, Lichuan, Hubei. This tree is the "type specimen" of metasequoia. It stands tall and proud, with twisted branches reaching for the sky. The tree is about 25 meters high and 3.5 meters in circumference. It is approximately 400 years old and still thrives with lush foliage, reproducing its offspring. Later, several hundred large metasequoia trees were found in Xiahe, Yujia Ba, and Luojia Ba in Lichuan, Hubei. In 1945, metasequoia was officially identified and named by Chinese botanist Hu Xianqian and forestry expert Zheng Wanjun, causing a sensation in the global botanical community. It was hailed as a "living fossil," and the metasequoia in Xiduo Creek, Lichuan, was named the "Ancient World's Grandfather." This discovery is considered one of the greatest contributions to botany in the 20th century.

To protect the "World's Grandfather," the "Metasequoia Conservation Committee" was established in 1945, but with little effect. At that time, Japanese botanist Yamamoto Shigeo claimed that China's fossil plants were a new genus of "Metasequoia," which would become extinct. Forty-three years later, on September 9, 1988, the elderly woman standing before the "World's Grandfather" with tears streaming down her face was Yamamoto Shigeo's wife. She came to verify her husband's claim but was overcome with emotion upon seeing the thriving, towering "World's Grandfather."

After the founding of New China, the Party and the government paid great attention to the health of the "World's Grandfather," allocating special funds for its protection. Efforts were made to propagate and cultivate it widely, and to strengthen research and management. Now, its offspring can be found in 18 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, with billions of seedlings produced each year. Since it is a dioecious plant, it generally takes 30 to 40 years to become a reproductive mother tree. All the existing metasequoia mother trees in China are in Lichuan, Hubei, totaling 5,746 trees, each numbered and carefully protected. They can produce about 2,000 pounds of seeds per year, making them a rare treasure worldwide. Therefore, locals also call it the "money tree" or "immortal tree." The Lichuan Forestry Research Institute, after years of exploration, used the method of grafting mother tree branches to shorten the seed-bearing period of metasequoia to six years. This achievement has been highly praised by domestic and foreign experts. Today, in the kingdom of metasequoia, the "World's Grandfather" has four generations living together!

    水杉“世界爷”
    曾国操
    一位高龄八十二岁的家庭主妇，从日本万里迢迢来到中国鄂西绿色树海中，紧紧拥抱着一棵水杉树。她将手伸得老长，只围住树的一股茎藤，于是又抚摸着树身，禁不住流下了泪水……
    这棵树叫“世界爷”。一亿三千万年前，水杉就诞生于北极圈了。此后大约在新生代中期，由于气候、地质的变迁，水杉逐渐分布到欧、亚、北美三洲。后来，经过第四纪特大冰川，水杉几乎全部绝灭，仅在我国未受冰川严重影响的川、鄂、湘等地有极少部分幸存下来。但在很长一段时期内，同欧美一样，人们只见过从地层中发掘出来的水杉化石，不知有活的水杉默默无闻地遗存在群山里。一九四一年，我国有一位教授首先在湖北西部的利川谋道溪发现这株大水杉，它就是水杉的“模式标本”。它龙骨虬枝，拔地凌空，昂首云天。树高约二十五米，胸围三点五米。树龄在四百年左右，至今仍然枝叶繁茂，繁殖着后代。以后有人在湖北利川的小河、喻家坝、罗家坝发现数百株大水杉群。一九四五年，水杉经我国植物分类学家胡先骕教授和林木学家郑万钧教授正式鉴定并撰文命名，轰动了世界植物界，被誉为“活化石”，称利川谋道一号水杉为“古老世界爷”。这个发现被誉为二十世纪植物学上最大发现，是我国科学家的伟大贡献之一。
    为保护“世界爷”，一九四五年还成立了“水杉保存委员会”，但收效甚微。当时日本生物学家山本茂教授曾断言中国的化石植物是新属“亚红杉”，将会绝灭。相隔四十三年之后的一九八八年九月九日在“世界爷”面前满脸泪痕的老太婆，原来就是这位日本生物学家山本茂之妻。她为证实丈夫的断言而来，目睹这愈加繁茂顶天立地的“世界爷”后，难以掩饰激动之情。
    新中国诞生后，党和政府十分重视“世界爷”的健康，拨专款围护。大力繁殖、广为栽培，加强科研和管理。现在，它的后代已遍及十八个省、市、自治区，每年育苗达数亿株。因为它属单性花，一般要三四十年才能成为有繁殖力的母体。我国现存的水杉母树全部在湖北利川，共有五千七百四十六株，株株编号建档，妥善保护，每年可产籽两千斤左右，为世界稀有珍品。因此当地人还有的称它为“摇钱树”、“仙木”。利川市林科所经过多年探索，采用母树支条嫁接法使水杉的结籽期缩短为六年，这一成果受到国内外专家的好评。今天，在水杉的王国里，“世界爷”是四世同堂！
