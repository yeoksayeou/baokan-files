Egypt is a developing country that has long implemented an open policy. Attracting both domestic and foreign capital and encouraging investment are key components of this open policy.

Egyptian economists believe that Egypt's open policy has gone through two stages. The first stage began in 1974. At that time, President Sadat decided to implement the open policy, aiming to attract capital and technology from Arab and other countries, mobilize domestic capital for investment, stimulate economic activity, and enhance national strength. This policy brought some benefits to Egypt's economic development, but it also had some drawbacks, such as the unclear purpose of using foreign loans, the use of large amounts of foreign exchange to import high-end consumer goods and daily necessities that Egypt could produce itself, the lack of focus on industrial and agricultural production in government investment policies, and the poor management of free trade zones, which led to severe speculation. They believe that during this stage, Egypt implemented a "consumption-oriented open policy."

The second stage began in the early 1980s. After President Mubarak took office in 1981, he made developing the national economy the central task and decided to transform the "consumption-oriented open policy" into a "production-oriented open policy." He significantly adjusted economic policies, with the focus on reforming state-owned enterprises, encouraging foreign investment, stimulating domestic capital to invest in the production sector, adjusting import and export policies, emphasizing agricultural development, tightening expenditures, and curbing consumption. The policies proposed by President Mubarak and the Egyptian government have achieved significant results. During this period, Egypt made considerable progress in attracting domestic and foreign capital for production projects. According to incomplete statistics, by the first half of 1988, Arab countries had invested $3.5 billion in Egypt, covering more than 70 projects. In addition, Egypt also obtained a large amount of grants, loans, and advanced technology from abroad.

Recently, Egyptian economists have proposed that the international and Middle Eastern situations are gradually easing, with Taba returning to Egypt and Egypt rejoining the Arab League and becoming an important member of the Arab Cooperation Council. In this new situation, the biggest challenge facing Egypt is how to quickly develop its economy. They believe that Egypt's open policy has entered the third stage. Economic development in the new stage will largely depend on the progress of new investment work. Therefore, how to improve investment work has become a key link in the future open policy.

The Egyptian government attaches great importance to investment work and has formulated a new investment law based on the investment law of 1974. The main purposes of the new investment law are:

	(1) Egyptian investors can enjoy the same preferential treatment as Arab and other foreign investors.
	(2) Investment management departments are unified to overcome administrative and procedural obstacles that hinder the development of the investment industry.
	(3) Solve the problems of existing projects, especially the foreign exchange and local currency debts of these projects.
	(4) Encourage investment in priority development projects determined by the state.
	(5) Create a suitable environment for attracting Egyptian, Arab, and foreign capital to achieve the goals set by the national plan.
	(6) Provide all guarantees and incentives to investors to encourage investment in Egypt and avoid non-commercial risks.

The promulgation of the new investment law will help better utilize domestic funds and attract more Arab and other foreign capital.

### 埃及在开放中鼓励投资

　　埃及在开放中鼓励投资
　　时延春
    埃及是一个发展中国家，长期以来执行开放政策。吸收国内外资金、鼓励投资是其开放政策的一项重要内容。
    埃及经济学家们认为，埃及的开放政策已经历了两个阶段。第一阶段始于1974年。当时，萨达特总统决定实施开放政策，其初旨是吸引阿拉伯及其他国家资金和技术，动员本国资金投资，活跃经济，增强国力。这项政策给埃及的经济发展带来一些效益，但也出现一些弊端，如使用外国贷款的目的性不明确，将大笔外汇用于进口高档消费品和本国可以生产的日用生活用品；政府投资政策的重点没有放在工农业生产上；自由区管理不善，投机倒把现象严重等。他们认为，这一阶段埃及执行的是“消费型开放政策”。
    第二阶段始于80年代初。1981年穆巴拉克总统执政后，把发展国民经济作为中心任务，决定把“消费型开放政策”变为“生产型开放政策”，大幅度调整经济政策，其重点是：改革国营企业，鼓励外国投资，调动本国资本向生产部门投资的积极性，调整进出口政策，重视发展农业，紧缩开支，抑制消费。穆巴拉克总统和埃及政府提出的这些政策取得了显著成绩。这段时期，埃及在吸引国内外资金用于生产项目投资方面也有很大进展。据不完全统计，到1988年上半年，在埃及的阿拉伯国家投资已达35亿美元，涉及70多个项目。此外，埃及还从国外获取了大量赠款、贷款及先进技术。
    最近，埃及经济学家提出，国际形势和中东形势正逐步走向缓和，塔巴已回归埃及，埃及重返阿盟并成为阿拉伯合作委员会重要成员国。在这种新形势下，埃及面临的最大挑战就是如何尽快把经济搞上去。他们认为，目前埃及的开放政策进入了第三阶段。新阶段经济发展在很大程度上将取决于新投资工作的进展状况。因此，如何搞好投资工作便成为今后开放政策的关键性环节。
    埃及政府非常重视投资工作，在1974年颁布的投资法基础上，制定了新的投资法。新投资法主要宗旨是：
  （一）埃及投资者可享受与阿拉伯及其他国家投资商相同的优惠待遇。（二）投资管理部门统一归口，克服影响投资业发展的行政性和程序性障碍。（三）解决现有项目存在的问题，解决这些项目外汇和当地货币的债务问题。（四）鼓励在国家确定的优先发展项目方面进行投资。（五）为吸收埃及、阿拉伯和外国资金创造适宜环境，以实现国家计划所规定的目标。
  （六）为鼓励在埃及进行投资，向投资商提供一切保障和奖励，避免非商业性风险。
    新投资法的颁布，将有助于更好地利用国内资金和吸引更多的阿拉伯及其他国家的资金。
