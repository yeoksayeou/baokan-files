The earliest document of the CPC opposing corruption and decadence is the notice issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 4, 1926, titled "Notice on Resolutely Cleaning Out Corrupt and Decadent Elements." This notice, which links the revolutionary situation at the time, emphasizes the necessity of resolutely eliminating corruption and decadence: "At a time when the revolutionary tide is still surging, many opportunistic and corrupt elements will flock to the revolutionary ranks. If a revolutionary party allows these elements to remain, it will inevitably lead to the party's corruption, not only failing to carry out revolutionary work but also being despised by the masses. Therefore, we must resolutely clean out these bad elements and struggle against these bad tendencies to strengthen our ranks and establish the party's prestige among the masses." The Central Committee requires that all levels of party organizations, upon receiving the notice, "immediately carry it out and report the results to the Central Bureau, which is of utmost importance." This shows that the Communist Party of China, in its early days, was already striving to maintain the purity of the Communist Party's organization and its prestige among the masses, to enhance the party's combat effectiveness, and to resolutely fight against the corrupt and decadent practices left over from the old society.

    我党反对贪污腐化的最早文件
    中共中央于1926年8月4日向全党发出的《关于坚决清洗贪污腐化分子的通告》是迄今发现的最早的反对贪污腐化的文件。《通告》联系当时的革命形势，强调了坚决清除贪污腐化的必要性：“在这个革命潮流仍然高涨的时候，许多投机腐败的坏分子，均会跑到革命队伍中来。一个革命的党若是容留这些分子在内，必定会使他的党陷于腐化，不仅不能执行革命的工作，且为群众所厌弃。所以应该很坚决地清洗这些不良分子，和这些不良倾向斗争，才能坚固我们的营垒，才能树立党在群众中的威望。”党中央要求各级党组织接到《通告》后，“立即执行，并将结果具报中央局，是为至要”。这表明中国共产党在建党初期已在为维护共产党的组织的纯洁性及其在群众中的威信，提高党的战斗力，坚持同旧社会遗留下来的贪污腐化行为作不调和的斗争。
