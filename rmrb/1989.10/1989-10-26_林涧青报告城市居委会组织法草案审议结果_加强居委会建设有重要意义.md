Lin Jianqing reported on the results of the review of the draft Law on Urban Residents' Committees at the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress held today. He said that the Law Committee believes that urban residents' committees are grassroots self-governing organizations in cities. Strengthening the construction of urban residents' committees, implementing grassroots direct democracy, and relying on urban grassroots masses to handle their own affairs are of great significance in strengthening the close ties between the Party and the government with the people, developing socialist democracy, and promoting the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization. In the new situation, it is necessary to amend the 1954 Regulations on Urban Residents' Committees. The draft is basically feasible. At the same time, some amendments are proposed.

Lin Jianqing said that the draft stipulates that the residents' committee "works under the guidance of the people's government of a city that is not divided into districts or its dispatched agencies." Based on the opinions of some committee members and local authorities, it is suggested to amend it to: "The people's government of a city that is not divided into districts or its dispatched agencies shall guide, support, and assist the work of the residents' committee. The residents' committee shall assist the people's government of a city that is not divided into districts or its dispatched agencies in their work."

He said that some committee members pointed out that it is very important for residents' committees to carry out convenient and beneficial services for the people, which should be emphasized in the law. Therefore, it is suggested to add the provision: "Residents' committees shall carry out community services that are convenient and beneficial to the people."

Lin Jianqing said that the draft stipulates: "The director, deputy directors, and members of the residents' committee shall be elected by all residents with the right to vote in the residential area or by representatives elected from each household." Many places and some committee members suggested that it is difficult to convene a meeting of several hundred households, and it would be better to make the regulations more flexible. Therefore, it is suggested to add the provision: "According to the opinions of the residents, representatives elected by residents' groups can also be elected." At the same time, corresponding amendments are made to the relevant articles of the draft.

　　林涧青报告城市居委会组织法草案审议结果
    加强居委会建设有重要意义
    新华社北京10月25日电　全国人大法律委员会副主任委员林涧青在今天举行的七届全国人大常委会第十次会议上作全国人大法律委员会对城市居民委员会组织法草案审议结果的报告时说，法律委员会认为，城市居民委员会是城市基层群众性自治组织，加强城市居民委员会的建设，实行基层直接民主，依靠城市基层群众办理群众自己的事情，对于加强党和政府同人民群众的密切联系，发展社会主义民主，促进社会主义物质文明、精神文明建设，都具有重要的意义。在新的形势下，对1954年的城市居民委员会组织条例进行修订很有必要，草案基本上是可行的。同时，提出一些修改意见。
    林涧青说，草案规定，居民委员会“在不设区的市、市辖区人民政府或者它的派出机关指导下进行工作”。根据有些委员和地方的意见，建议修改为：“不设区的市、市辖区的人民政府或者它的派出机关对居民委员会的工作给予指导、支持和帮助。居民委员会协助不设区的市、市辖区的人民政府或者它的派出机关开展工作。”
    他说，有些委员提出，居民委员会开展便民利民的服务活动非常重要，应当在法中予以强调。因此，建议增加规定：“居民委员会应当开展便民利民的社区服务活动。”
    林涧青说，草案规定：“居民委员会主任、副主任和委员，由本居住区全体有选举权的居民或者由每户派代表选举产生。”许多地方和有些委员提出，召集几百户居民开会很难办到，最好规定得灵活些。因此，建议增加规定“根据居民意见，也可以由居民小组推选的代表选举产生”。同时，对草案有关条款作相应修改。
