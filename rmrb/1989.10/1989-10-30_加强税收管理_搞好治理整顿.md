Jiang Zemin comrade said in the celebration speech of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation: “During the period of rectification and adjustment, it is more necessary to emphasize appropriate concentration, gradually increase the proportion of national fiscal revenue in national income, and increase the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national fiscal revenue. Without the necessary financial power, the central government cannot guarantee the implementation of key construction projects and the tasks of rectification and adjustment.” To achieve this, it is necessary to strengthen the collection and management of national taxes at present. From the current situation, I think there are two issues that need to be studied and solved.

First, the state has formulated different tax rates for different products or industries for turnover tax categories, with the highest tax rate for commodity tax reaching 60% and the lowest being 3%. The difference in tax payments for different products based on the same taxable income is very large. Some enterprises, especially those with high tax rates and high tax payments, often think that this is their own created value, high economic benefits, and great contribution to the state, while the profits left to the unit are not much. Therefore, some people propose that enterprises should participate in the distribution of state taxes and enjoy some special tax concessions, leaving part of the tax payments to the enterprise. This issue needs to be analyzed. Indeed, from an overall perspective, state taxes, like enterprise profits, are a part of the value represented by social net income, created by production units, representing the economic benefits of enterprises, and indicating the contribution of enterprises to society. The problem lies in the fact that the taxes and profits realized by each enterprise do not necessarily correspond exactly to the creation, benefits, and contributions of the enterprise. There is often a significant gap. Some industries and enterprises with high taxes and high profits may be the result of the value created by laborers in other industries and enterprises being transferred to their own industries and enterprises. This is because the amount of taxes and profits realized by an industry or enterprise, in addition to their own efforts, is also influenced by various objective conditions. One of the most prominent factors is that the price of each specific commodity, based on state policies and supply-demand relationships, often has a gap with its actual value, and sometimes the gap is very large. When the price is higher than the value, the realized net income (taxes and profits) is generally more, otherwise, it is less. For example, the tobacco processing industry in our country, which pays the most taxes, has a tax and profit rate of about three to four times the average of the entire state-owned industry when calculated based on sales revenue and output value, and more than ten times when calculated based on funds. The fundamental reason for this situation is that tobacco processing products have always been high-priced and high-taxed, with the two influencing each other. High taxes lead to high prices, far exceeding their intrinsic value. The excess part of the net income (taxes) is actually the value created by laborers in other agricultural and industrial products, transferred to tobacco processing products, and cannot be considered as the labor creation of the tobacco processing industry. Of course, this part of the value is ultimately realized and handed over to the state in the form of taxes, and the tobacco processing enterprise also has its own contribution. In the establishment of a new economic operation mechanism, our country's taxes, as an important economic lever for macro-control directly controlled by the state, are to use various different methods such as tax category selection, tax rate high and low, and calculation and collection, to collect the various differential incomes formed by enterprises due to price-value deviation and objective factors such as resources, equipment conditions, land, property ownership, geographical and transportation differences, and to promote enterprises with different conditions to compete on a roughly equal starting line, give full play to their respective advantages, and improve economic benefits. If some enterprises are allowed to participate in tax distribution and convert part of the taxes they should pay into their own property, this will inevitably lead to tax loss, causing the dispersion of national fiscal revenue, which is not conducive to the rectification and adjustment.

Second, taxes, as a highly centralized planned distribution, must be able to fully play their due role, and must strictly block and change any unit and individual from eroding them in any illegal and legal forms. This requires rectifying the tax order, strengthening tax management, and adhering to the rule of law in taxation; changing some unreasonable systems and methods, and seriously drawing a clear distinction between the two different distributions of taxes and profits, and effectively guaranteeing the centralized planned distribution of taxes. In the current economic environment rectification, economic order rectification, and comprehensive deepening of reform, the important thing to do is: first, resolutely crack down on tax evasion, tax avoidance, and tax arrears. Tax evasion is covert; not paying or underpaying taxes, tax resistance, and tax arrears are open resistance to not paying or misappropriating and delaying taxes, all of which belong to the erosion of national taxes by taxpayers. Now many enterprise units and individual industrial and commercial households are relying on illegal tax evasion to get rich, and "official speculation" and "private speculation" are even more serious tax evaders, causing serious damage to national finance and social economic order. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly enforce tax laws and regulations, strengthen tax collection and administration; strengthen tax publicity, improve tax awareness; grant necessary inspection powers to tax authorities, strengthen the power of compulsory execution; strengthen inter-departmental cooperation, and establish social supervision. In these many aspects, take all effective measures to block tax evasion, tax avoidance, and tax arrears. Some regions and departments intercept, misappropriate, and squeeze national taxes, and similarly, effective measures must be taken to crack down on them. Second, seriously clean up and rectify and strictly control tax exemptions and reductions. Tax exemptions and reductions are legal reductions or exemptions of part of the taxes that taxpayers should pay. It is only a special adjustment measure used by the state for certain special situations. It must be used appropriately according to the actual needs of the overall situation, and only then can it be conducive to promoting production and activating the economy. In recent years, there have been too many tax exemptions and reductions. Many regions and departments, based on their own interests, often exceed the tax law regulations and management authority, open the door to tax exemptions and reductions at will, and leave part of the taxes that should be concentrated by the state to the enterprises. This not only affects national fiscal revenue and hinders the role of the tax lever but also leads to the reverse regulation of taxes. Some high-tax-rate products and long-line products, due to enjoying tax exemption and reduction preferences in some regions, have caused blind development of such production in these regions, seriously harming the overall interests of the state and society, and ultimately even harming the interests of the region and the tax-exempted and reduced units. It is completely necessary to carry out a thorough and serious cleanup and rectification of tax exemptions and reductions at present. Not only should those tax exemption and reduction incidents that exceed tax laws and management authority be dealt with strictly, but even those tax exemptions and reductions stipulated in tax laws and regulations, if they are inappropriate or unnecessary, should also be abolished through legal procedures. Tax exemptions and reductions must be strictly controlled within a completely necessary and reasonable small range to adapt to the nature of tax exemptions and reductions as a special adjustment measure, to ensure that all types of enterprises pay taxes equally and bear reasonable burdens, and to compete on roughly equal terms. Third, change the practice of "tax deduction before loan repayment" and "tax repayment of loans". The current practice of allowing state-owned enterprises to use the profits before income tax collection to repay bank technical measure loans and construction loans, as well as the practice of allowing enterprises to use part of the commodity tax and value-added tax to repay construction loans in certain special situations, is actually allowing enterprises to use the taxes that should belong to the state to replace their own repayment of bank debts. Under this system, the more loans an enterprise has, the more taxes it will use to repay the loans. Enterprises have the autonomy to apply for and obtain loans, and similarly, they also have the power to control and decide on national taxes, which is actually a special form of enterprises legally participating in the distribution of national taxes, allowing enterprises to freely enjoy the national tax revenue. Enterprises have national taxes to repay loans, and they can still deduct employee welfare and bonus funds from pre-tax profits. The more loans an enterprise has, the less tax it pays, the lighter the tax burden, and the greater the benefit, without considering the investment effect of loans; banks also have national taxes as loan guarantees, can stably obtain interest income, and do not need to worry about bad debt losses. Both parties have no risk and responsibility constraints, forming enterprises to mainly use collective consumption for retained profits, while production relies on more loans, with the amount increasing year by year, far exceeding the growth of profits, making it difficult to establish the self-discipline mechanism of enterprise investment and consumption, and exacerbating the double expansion of social investment and consumption in recent years. There are also many problems with the current enterprise contract responsibility system, which includes the fixed delivery of income tax. For this, we must actively try out the "tax and profit separation and management" enterprise income distribution system, draw a clear distinction between the two different distributions of taxes and profits, neither allowing taxes to occupy the share of post-tax profits, nor allowing enterprises to participate in tax distribution in various disguised forms, and maintain the principle of centralized planned distribution of taxes by the state.

### 加强税收管理  搞好治理整顿

　　加强税收管理  搞好治理整顿
　　王诚尧
    江泽民同志在建国40周年庆祝大会上的讲话中说：“在治理整顿期间，更要强调适当集中，逐步提高国家财政收入在国民收入中的比重，提高中央财政收入在国家财政收入中的比重。中央不掌握必要的财力，就不可能保证重点建设和治理整顿任务的实现。”要做到这一点，当前必须加强国家税收的征收和管理。从目前情况看，我认为有两个问题要研究解决。
    一、国家按不同的产品或行业，为流转税类的各税种制订了高低不同的税率，其中产品税税率，高的达60％，低的只为3％。不同产品按同等计税收入计算交纳的税款差距很大。有些企业，特别是税率高、交税多的企业，往往认为这就是自身创造的价值多，经济效益高，对国家贡献大，而留归本单位的利润却并不多。由此，有人提出企业单位应参与国家税收分配，要在纳税上享受一些特殊优惠，把一部分税款留归企业。对这个问题要进行分析。诚然，就总的方面说，国家税收如同企业利润一样，是以社会纯收入形式体现的那部分价值，是生产单位创造的，能代表企业的经济效益，是表明了企业对社会所作的贡献的。问题在于，每个企业实现的税收、利润，并不恰好与本企业的上述创造、效益、贡献相等，其间往往存在较大差距。有些行业、企业交税多、利润大，很可能是其他行业、企业劳动者创造的价值转移到本行业、企业实现的结果。这是因为一个行业、企业实现多少税收利润，除了自身的主观努力外，还有多种客观条件的影响。其中突出的一项，就是基于国家政策和供需关系等多种因素形成的每种具体商品的价格与其实际价值往往都有差距，有些甚至差距很大。价格高于价值的，实现的纯收入（税利）一般就多，否则就少。例如我国交税最多的烟草加工行业，按销售收入、产值计算的税利率约为整个国营工业平均数的三四倍，按资金计算的税利率更高达10倍多。所以出现这种情况，其基本原因，就在于烟草加工产品历来都是价高、税大，两者相互影响。高税形成高价，远远超出本身价值，该超出部分的纯收入（税），实际是其他某些工农业产品劳动者创造出来的价值转移到烟草加工产品上实现的，不能算作烟草加工业的劳动创造，无特殊权利参与其中的分配。当然，这部分价值得以最终实现，并用税收形式交给国家，烟草加工企业也是有它的一定贡献的。在建立新的经济运行机制中，我国税收作为由国家直接掌握进行宏观调控的重要经济杠杆，就是要通过税种选择、税率高低和计算征收等多方面的差别办法，来把企业由于价格价值背离以及资源、设备条件、土地、财产占有、地理交通差异等客观因素所形成的各种差别收入收归国家，促进条件不同的各类企业，在大体同等的起跑线上开展竞争，发挥各自优势，提高经济效益。如果让某些企业参与税收分配，把应交的一部分税款，转为这些企业所有，不适当地扩大这些企业的利益，必然造成税收流失，导致国家财政收入的分散，这对于搞好治理整顿是不利的。
    二、税收作为国家高度集中的一种计划分配，要能充分发挥它应有的职能作用，必须严格堵塞和改变任何单位和个人以任何非法和合法形式的侵蚀，这就要整顿税收秩序，加强税收管理，坚持以法治税；要改变若干不合理的制度和办法，认真划清税利两种不同分配界限，切实保障税收的集中计划分配。在当前治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和全面深化改革中着重要做的是：第一，坚决制裁偷漏抗欠税。偷漏税是隐蔽的；不交或少交税款、抗欠税是公开的抗拒不交或挪用拖欠税款，都属于纳税人对国家税收的侵蚀。现在许多企业单位和个体工商业户就是依靠非法的偷漏税来发财致富的，“官倒”、“私倒”更是严重的偷漏税者，给国家财政和社会经济秩序造成严重损害。为此，必须严肃税收法纪，严密税收征管；必须加强税收宣传，提高纳税观念；必须赋予税务机关必要的检查权，强化强制执行的权力；必须搞好部门配合，建立社会监督。要在这许多方面，采取一切有力措施来堵塞偷漏抗欠税。有些地区、部门截留、挪用、挤占国家税款，同样要采取制裁的有效措施。第二，认真清理整顿和严格控制减免税。减免税是依法对纳税人应交税款部分减征或全部免征。它只是国家针对某些特殊情况所运用的特殊调节手段。必须适应全局实际需要，依法运用得当，才能有利于促进发展生产，搞活经济。近年来减税免税过多过滥。不少地区部门从本位利益出发，往往超越税法规定和管理权限，乱开减免税口子，把部分应由国家集中的税款留给企业，这不但影响了国家财政收入，妨碍了税收杠杆作用的发挥，而且导致了税收的反向性调节。一些限制生产的高税率产品和长线产品，由于在某些地区享受减免税优待，造成在这些地区的该项生产盲目发展，严重危害了国家和社会的整体利益，最终甚至也要损害本地区和减免税单位的利益。当前对减免税进行全面彻底的认真清理整顿，是完全必要的。不但要从严处置那些超越税法和管理权限的减免税事件，就是税收法令中规定的那些减免税，有不适当或不必要的，也要通过法定程序加以废止。必须严格把减免税控制在一个完全必要和合理的较小范围以内，以适应减免税只作为特殊调节手段的性能，保证各类企业都平等纳税，合理负担，在大体同等条件下开展竞争。第三，改变“税前还贷”、“以税还贷”的做法。现行的准许公有制企业用征收所得税前利润，归还银行技术措施性贷款和基本建设性贷款的“税前还贷”办法，以及对某些特殊情况还准许企业用部分产品税、增值税归还基建性贷款的“以税还贷”办法，实际是让企业用应归属国家税款来代替自身偿还银行债务。在这种体制下，企业贷款多少，基本上就要用税款代为还贷多少。企业掌握了对申请和取得贷款的自主权，同样也就取得了对国家税收的很大支配和决策的权限，实际是企业合法参与国家税收分配的一种特殊形式，是变相地允许企业放开肚皮吃国家税收这口大锅的饭。企业有国家税收代还贷款，还可从税前利润照提职工福利、奖金基金，企业贷款越多交税越少，税负越轻受益越大，而不必顾虑贷款投资效益；银行也是有国家税收作还贷担保，可稳得利息收益，不必顾虑呆帐损失，借贷双方都无风险和责任制约，形成企业留利主要用于集体消费，而生产则靠多贷款，其数额逐年成倍增长，远远超过利润的增长，企业投资、消费的自我约束机制难以建立，加剧了近年来社会投资、消费的双膨胀。现行企业承包责任制中包干上交所得税的办法，也有许多问题。对此，我们必须积极试行“税利分流分管”的企业收入分配体制，划清税利两种不同分配界限，既不使税收挤占税后利润应有份额，也不让企业以各种变相形式参与税收分配，维护税收由国家集中计划分配的原则。
