The Foreign Ministry spokesperson today in Beijing clearly stated that the Chinese government opposes internationalizing the Hong Kong issue.

He made this statement in response to a reporter's question. A reporter asked: What is your comment on the recent attempts by British government leaders and some officials to internationalize the Hong Kong issue?

The spokesperson said that he had already explained the Chinese government's basic stance on October 18th when answering questions from reporters.

He pointed out that Hong Kong has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue clearly stipulates that the British government will return Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997, and the People's Republic of China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong at the same time. During the current transitional period, implementing the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue is entirely a matter between the governments of China and Britain. No other country or international organization has the right to intervene. Any attempt to internationalize the Hong Kong issue goes against the provisions and spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and violates international legal norms. This is, of course, something that the Chinese government cannot accept.

He said that to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and to ensure a smooth transfer of power, the British side must act in good faith and strictly adhere to the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue. Using tactics such as playing the "confidence card," "public opinion card," and even the "international card" to re-raise various unreasonable demands that have already been rejected during the Sino-British negotiations is absolutely unacceptable.

　　外交部发言人明确表示
　　中国政府反对把香港问题“国际化”
    新华社北京10月25日电  中国外交部发言人今天在北京明确表示，中国政府反对把香港问题“国际化”。
    他是在回答记者问题时作此表示的。有记者问：你对近一个时期来英国政府领导人和一些政府官员企图将香港问题“国际化”的言论和行动有何评论？
    这位发言人说，他在10月18日答记者问时已阐明了中国政府的基本立场。
    他指出，香港自古以来就是中国的领土。中英两国关于香港问题的联合声明中明确规定，英国政府于1997年将香港交还给中华人民共和国，中华人民共和国政府将于同时对香港恢复行使主权。在目前的过渡时期内，贯彻执行中英关于香港问题的联合声明，完全是中英两国政府之间的事，其他任何国家或国际组织都无权插手干预。任何把香港问题“国际化”的图谋都有悖于中英联合声明的规定和精神，也是违反国际法准则的。这当然是中国政府所断然不能接受的。
    他说，为了维护香港的繁荣稳定并保证政权的顺利交接，英方必须拿出诚意来，严格地按照中英关于香港问题的联合声明办事，使用打“信心牌”、“民意牌”以至“国际牌”等手法，重新提出在中英谈判过程中已被否定的各种不合理要求，是绝对行不通的。
