The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will issue a special stamp set titled "The 150th Anniversary of the Birth of Photography" on October 15. The set consists of one stamp.

Photography is a product of modern science and technology. On August 19, 1839, the daguerreotype invented by Daguerre was announced to the world by the French government, marking the birth of photography. Photography has enriched human cultural life, promoted the development of civilization, and is widely used in various aspects of modern social life. It has become an important means of propaganda, scientific research, and artistic creation. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of photography. Countries around the world will hold various forms of commemorative activities. The design of this stamp uses a hyper-realistic technique to depict a Chinese young woman taking a photograph. She holds the world emblem commemorating the 150th anniversary of photography in both hands, and a wreath symbolizes the outstanding achievements of photographic art.
