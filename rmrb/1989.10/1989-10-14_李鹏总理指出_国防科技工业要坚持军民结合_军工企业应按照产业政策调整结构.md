Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 13th - Premier Li Peng emphasized that China's defense science and technology industry must possess the ability to serve both military and civilian purposes and must steadfastly pursue the path of military-civilian integration. This was stated by the Premier during a meeting where he listened to a report on the National Military-Civilian Integration Work Conference, which concluded this afternoon.

The Minister of the State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, Ding Henggao, and other relevant department heads reported on the achievements of military-civilian integration over the past decade, analyzed the main problems currently faced, and discussed measures to further advance military-civilian integration during the period of rectification and reform.

After carefully listening to the reports, Li Peng said that the military-industrial complex is a large force, created by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, and has now developed into a significant production capacity. It has gathered a large number of scientific and technological talents and technical experts, forming a team with good quality and the ability to endure hardship. Li Peng pointed out that China's defense science and technology industry has made great achievements in strategic transformation, and practice has proven that the policy of military-civilian integration is completely correct. Only by developing civilian product production can military product research and production create better conditions.

Li Peng said that for the difficulties faced by military enterprises during the period of rectification and reform, there must be adequate mental preparation. Most military enterprises are part of the machinery industry, and a significant portion of their civilian consumer products have shifted from being in high demand to being in low demand. There is a shortage of funds, energy, and raw materials, which has brought new difficulties to the development of military-civilian integration work. In the future, military enterprises must adjust their structures according to the national industrial policy and actively develop civilian products. First, they must rely on national planning guidance, and second, they must vigorously explore the market and continuously develop new products. The two must be organically combined. Military enterprises should take the path of corporatization, forming a collective force, which is beneficial for technological transformation and fully utilizing technological and equipment advantages. A single military enterprise with only one flagship product is not enough; it must develop and form multiple technological products to adapt to market changes.

When discussing the introduction and digestion of advanced foreign technologies, Li Peng said that the military-industrial force must be fully utilized, and all levels of planning and foreign trade departments must ensure this. Military-industrial development must be included in the national unified plan and scheme, and must resolutely avoid duplicate introductions and constructions.

Li Peng emphasized the need to strengthen the concept of national defense. He said that although the international situation is easing, the factors of war still exist. Today's peace is built on the foundation of our national defense strength. We must continue to develop advanced weapons, track advanced technologies worldwide, and maintain a deterrent force.

Leaders such as Song Jian, Zhou Jiaxuan, and Liu Huaqing were present during the report.

This conference was approved by the State Council and jointly convened by the State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, and the State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense in Beijing on October 7th. Relevant department heads from the State Council, various military-industrial departments, and various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions attended the conference.

    李鹏总理指出
    国防科技工业要坚持军民结合
    军工企业应按照产业政策调整结构
    新华社北京10月13日电（记者许志敏）我国国防科技工业要具备能军能民两套本领，坚定不移地朝军民结合的方向发展。这是国务院总理李鹏在听取今天下午结束的全国军民结合工作会议情况汇报时说的这番话。
    国防科工委主任丁衡高等有关部门负责同志汇报了10年来开展军民结合工作的成绩，分析了当前存在的主要问题，以及在治理整顿的形势下进一步推进军民结合工作的措施。
    李鹏认真听取了各方面的汇报后说，军工队伍是一支大的队伍，是老一辈无产阶级革命家开创的，现在已经形成了巨大的生产能力，集中了一批科技人才和技术骨干，是一支素质好、能吃苦耐劳的好队伍。李鹏指出，我国的国防科技工业在实现战略转变中取得了很大的成绩，实践证明军民结合这个方针是完全正确的。只有军工企业开拓和发展民品生产，才能为军品科研和生产创造更好的条件。
    李鹏说，对在治理整顿时期军工企业面临的困难，要有足够的思想准备。军工企业大都是机械工业，所生产的相当部分民用消费品由畅销转入滞销，资金、能源、原材料紧缺，给军民结合工作的发展带来了新的困难。今后军工企业只有按照国家的产业政策，积极地进行军工结构调整才有出路。一要依靠国家计划指导，二要大力开拓市场，不断开发新产品。要把两者有机地结合起来。军工企业要走集团化的道路，形成整体的力量，有利于技术改造和充分发挥技术、设备的优势。一个军工企业仅有一个拳头产品是不够的，要开发形成多种技术产品，适应市场变化的需要。
    在谈到引进和消化国外先进技术时，李鹏说，要充分发挥军工力量，各级计划部门和外贸部门要把好这个关。要把军工纳入国家统一计划、规划，坚决避免重复引进和重复建设。
    李鹏强调要增强国防观念。他说，虽然国际形势趋于缓和，但战争的因素依然存在。我们今天的安宁是建立在我国国防实力基础上的。我们要继续发展尖端武器，跟踪世界先进技术，保持一支威慑力量。
    宋健、邹家华、刘华清等领导同志听取汇报时在座。
    这次会议是经国务院批准，国家计委、国家科委、国防科工委于10月7日在京联合召开的。国务院有关部委、各军工部门以及各省、市、自治区有关负责同志参加了会议。
