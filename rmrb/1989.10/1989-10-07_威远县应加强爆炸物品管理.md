Edition: 6

Weiyuan County, under the jurisdiction of Neijiang City, has 5 large coal mines approved by the province and the city, 153 township and village coal mines approved by the county, and more than 300 coal mines operated by villages, production teams, or joint village-team units without approval. There are also many private small coal mines that operate intermittently without approval, as well as numerous private lime kilns and brick kilns. Currently, all these mines and kilns in the county consume over 840 tons of explosives and more than 1.6 million detonators annually, accounting for over 70% of the total explosives and detonators used in Neijiang City.

In Weiyuan County, many mines and kilns use explosives without proper certification, leading to the dispersion of explosives in society. Incidents of explosions causing deaths and injuries occur from time to time. More seriously, some explosives and detonators have fallen into the hands of criminals, who use them for revenge, assaults, and explosive robberies, posing a severe threat to the safety of people's lives and property. Investigations have revealed that even officially approved coal mines, cement plants, lime kilns, and brick kilns often store and handle detonators and explosives carelessly, lending or selling them indiscriminately.

Additionally, the Light Industry Company of the County Materials Bureau frequently stores dozens of tons of explosives, but the safety facilities are extremely outdated. The company manager has repeatedly reported this to higher authorities, but it has not attracted the necessary attention. The Urban-Rural Company of the Materials Bureau has also reported to higher authorities that some districts and towns lack explosive storage facilities, and each time explosives and detonators are transported back, they have to be placed in open areas.

    威远县应加强爆炸物品管理
    内江市所辖威远县境内有5家省、市大煤矿，经批准的乡办、村办煤矿153家，未经批准的村办、组办、村组联办的煤窑300多个，未经批准而时开时停的私人小煤窑就更多了，私人办的石灰窑、砖瓦窑数不胜数。目前，全县这些矿、窑每年耗用炸药840多吨，雷管160多万个，占内江全市所用雷管、炸药量的70％以上。
    在威远县，无证使用爆炸物品的矿、窑很多，以致一些爆炸物品流散在社会上，不时发生炸死炸伤人的事件。尤其严重的是，有的炸药、雷管落入犯罪分子之手，用于报复行凶、爆炸抢劫，严重威胁着人民生命、财产的安全。据调查，经正式批准的煤矿、水泥厂、石灰窑、砖瓦窑等单位，将雷管、炸药乱存乱放，随便转借转卖。
    另外，县物资局轻化公司经常储存着数十吨炸药，但安全设施十分陈旧。公司经理曾多次向上级报告，一直未引起重视。物资局城乡公司向上级反映：有些区、镇没有炸药库房，每次运回的炸药和雷管只好摆在露天场上。
