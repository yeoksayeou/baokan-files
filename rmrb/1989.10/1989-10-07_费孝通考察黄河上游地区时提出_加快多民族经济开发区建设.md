Fei Xiaotong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, recently proposed during his inspection of Gansu Province that the development and construction of the multi-ethnic regions in the upper reaches of the Yellow River must rely on cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups, comprehensively develop the ethnic economy, and earnestly implement the principle of common prosperity for all ethnic groups.

The multi-ethnic economic development zone in the upper reaches of the Yellow River is located along the banks of the Yellow River in the four provinces and autonomous regions of Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia, covering an area of approximately 210,000 square kilometers. This area is rich in resources but has not been fully developed and utilized, and the economic lives of the various ethnic groups are relatively poor. Fei Xiaotong has visited this area many times in the past. Last year, he also submitted a proposal to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to develop the multi-ethnic economic zone in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. He suggested using the energy and resource advantages of this area to establish an energy and raw material industrial base in China, and at the same time, develop grain production and animal husbandry according to local conditions, so as to fundamentally change the imbalance in economic development between the eastern and western regions of China, and lay the foundation for improving the living conditions of the various ethnic groups in this region. This proposal has been approved and supported by the relevant departments of the central government and the four provinces and autonomous regions.

In September of this year, Fei Xiaotong spent nearly 20 days inspecting more than 10 counties and cities in the Hexi Corridor, Longnan Mountainous Area, central arid region, and Subei Grassland of Gansu Province. He pointed out that the recent proposal by the central leaders to concentrate efforts over the next 10 to 20 years to develop China's energy and raw material industries provides a favorable opportunity for the development of the multi-ethnic economic development zone in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, which has advantages in energy and raw materials. The relevant provinces and autonomous regions should seize this opportunity to accelerate the construction of the development zone and make contributions to the country.

    费孝通考察黄河上游地区时提出
    加快多民族经济开发区建设
    据新华社兰州10月6日电（记者张栋）全国人大常委会副委员长、民盟中央主席费孝通前不久到甘肃考察时提出，黄河上游多民族地区的开发建设必须依靠各族干部群众，全面发展民族经济，认真贯彻各民族共同繁荣的原则。
    黄河上游多民族经济开发区位于青海、甘肃、宁夏、内蒙古4省区的黄河两岸，面积约21万平方公里。这一带资源丰富，却未得到充分开发利用，各族群众经济生活比较贫困。费孝通过去曾多次到这里考察，去年还向中共中央提出了开发黄河上游多民族经济区的建议。他建议利用这里的能源和资源优势，建立我国的能源和原材料工业基地，同时因地制宜发展粮食生产和畜牧业，以便从根本上改变我国东西部经济发展不平衡的状况，为这一地区各族群众生活状况的改善奠定基础。这一建议得到了中央有关部门和4省区的赞同和支持。
    今年9月份，费孝通用近20天的时间对甘肃河西走廊、陇南山区、中部干旱地区和肃南草原的10多个县市进行了考察。他指出，中央领导同志最近提出的用一二十年的时间，集中力量发展中国的能源和原材料工业，给拥有能源和原材料优势的黄河上游多民族经济开发区提供了有利的发展时机，有关省区应抓住这个大好机会，加快开发区建设，为国家作出贡献。
