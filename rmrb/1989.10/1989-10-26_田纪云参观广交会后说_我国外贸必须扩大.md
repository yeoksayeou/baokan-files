Vice Premier Tian Jiyun said that China's foreign trade must develop and expand, and the Canton Fair must be held better and better. This was stated by Tian Jiyun this afternoon after he inspected the autumn session of the Canton Fair.

Tian Jiyun said, this session of the Canton Fair has attracted many guests, and the export turnover has achieved significant results. The management and order are much better than in previous sessions, leaving a good impression on the guests.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that since the implementation of the open policy, China's economy has been closely linked with the international economy in countless ways. Some production materials needed for China's economic development must be imported, and to import, foreign exchange is needed, which in turn requires exports. China's foreign trade can only expand, not shrink; this is a requirement of reform and opening up. The development of foreign trade, like any other undertaking, must give full play to the initiative of both the central and local governments. At present, in addition to the central government, local authorities should also actively raise funds, both to purchase agricultural and sideline products and to purchase export commodities. More exports and more foreign exchange earnings are needed, and all export commodities that should be purchased must be procured. The Canton Fair must be continued and improved.

　　田纪云参观广交会后说
　　我国外贸必须扩大
    据新华社广州10月25日电  （记者史美泗）我国的对外贸易必须发展，必须扩大，广交会要越办越好。这是国务院副总理田纪云今天下午参观了秋季广交会后说的。
    田纪云说，这届广交会来宾很多，出口成交额已取得很大成绩，管理、秩序大大好于往届，给来宾留下了一个好印象。
    田纪云指出，实行对外开放以来，我国的经济已与国际经济有着千丝万缕的联系。我国经济发展中一些生产资料需要进口，要进口就要外汇，就必须出口。我国的外贸只能扩大，不能萎缩，这是改革开放的需要。发展外贸与其他任何事业一样，都必须发挥中央和地方两个积极性。当前除中央外，各地也要积极筹集资金，一是搞好农副产品收购，一是搞好外贸出口商品收购。要多出口、多收汇，要把该收购的出口商品收购上来。广交会要坚持办下去，要越办越好。
