Capital Martial Law Troops Celebrate National Day with Citizens

The capital is in full bloom, and soldiers and civilians are singing and dancing together. The capital's martial law troops and the people of Beijing are celebrating National Day in various forms.

In recent days, the barracks of various martial law troops have been filled with laughter and joy. A 100-person stilts team from a certain regiment showcased their skills at a soldier-civilian celebration; a drum team from a unit recognized as an advanced cultural unit in the entire army performed on the streets of the capital; a dance team of over a thousand soldiers from a certain unit gave a splendid performance for the people of the capital. Soldier-civilian celebrations, park visits, movie nights, and other activities are being enthusiastically held in various barracks.

Activities praising the great achievements of the Communist Party of China and discussing the glorious 40-year journey of our great motherland are widely carried out among the soldiers and civilians of the capital. Martial law troops and Beijing youth jointly held a "Welcome National Day, Talk About Patriotic Feelings" seminar, reminiscing about the earth-shattering changes in socialist China over the past 40 years and exchanging books with each other.

To ensure that the people of the capital have a peaceful and joyful holiday, the martial law troops have worked hard. The reporter saw that at major intersections in the capital, there are sentinels on duty, diligently performing their duties. The martial law troops stationed near Zhongshan Park, in addition to completing their heavy duties, also spared a large amount of manpower to plant lawns, clean up garbage, and bury pipes, completing two projects ahead of schedule.

    首都戒严部队与市民欢度国庆
    据新华社北京9月30日电（记者陈辉）京城繁花似锦，军民同歌共舞。首都戒严部队同首都人民采用多种形式庆祝国庆。
    连日来，各戒严部队驻地一片欢声笑语。某团组织的百人高跷队，在军民联欢会上一展英姿；被评为全军基层文化先进单位的某部组织的腰鼓队，在首都街头大显身手；某部千余名官兵组成的舞蹈队，为首都人民做了精彩的演出。军民联欢会、游园会、电影晚会等活动在各部队驻地热烈举行。
    颂扬中国共产党的丰功伟绩、畅谈伟大祖国四十年光辉历程的活动，在首都军民中广泛展开。戒严部队官兵和首都青年联合举办了迎国庆共话爱国情座谈会，共叙40年来社会主义祖国翻天覆地的变化，并互赠了书籍。
    为了首都人民能过个安宁、愉快的佳节，戒严部队付出了辛勤的劳动。记者看到在京城主要街头路口都有忠于职守、认真执勤的哨兵。驻中山公园附近的戒严部队除完成繁重的执勤任务外，还抽出大量人力种草坪、清垃圾、埋管道，使两项工程提前完工。
