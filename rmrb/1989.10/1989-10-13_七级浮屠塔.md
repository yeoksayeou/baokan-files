In the city of Harbin, where classical Chinese architecture is rare, stands a pagoda that exudes an ancient charm, showcasing a unique allure. This pagoda is located in the eastern courtyard of the Jile Temple, which was inscribed by Zhang Jian, a jinshi (the highest degree in the imperial examination system) of the late Qing Dynasty and a renowned industrialist of modern times. The pagoda is part of the Jile Temple complex, standing seven stories high, and is known as the "Seven-Storied Pagoda." The term "浮屠" (futu) is a misinterpretation of the Sanskrit word "Buddha," but this misinterpretation has been widely used ever since. This pagoda was completed in 1924. Although it is a modern structure, its ancient style closely resembles that of traditional architecture.

The 30-meter-tall pagoda reaches up to the sky, connected by a hall with intricate carvings and paintings to the Dizang Hall. The first four levels of the pagoda house copper statues of Dizang Wang, Guanshiyin, Wenshu, and Puxian, while the upper three levels house statues of Yaoshi Fo, Amituo Fo, and the Buddha Sakyamuni. Each level of the pagoda is adorned with exquisite Buddhist murals, featuring beautiful and vibrant characters and scenes. However, over a decade ago, the statues were melted down for their copper, and the murals were destroyed.

Today, the pagoda has been restored and reopened to the public. Of course, the copper statues are gone, replaced by clay sculptures, and the murals have been repainted, restoring the pagoda to its original appearance. The exterior remains as majestic and mysterious as ever.

    七级浮屠塔
    陶伟宁
    在哈尔滨这座中国古典式建筑极为少见的城市中，矗立着一座古色古香的佛塔，显示了别具一格的魅力。
    这座佛塔坐落在清末状元、近代著名实业家张謇手书的哈尔滨极乐寺东院，属极乐寺的组成部分，塔高七层，人称“七级浮屠塔”。“浮屠”是梵文“佛陀”的音译，实际此译是前人的一种误译，可这一误译却一直被人们延用至今。这座佛塔是在1924年建成的，它虽属现代建筑，可它的仿古风姿却与古建筑相似不二。
    30米高的塔身尖耸入云，一座雕梁画栋的卷棚敞厅与塔相连接，直通地藏殿。地藏王、观世音、文殊、普贤四尊铜雕像分别在塔一至四层供奉，而上三层供奉的则是药师佛、阿弥陀佛、佛祖释迦牟尼。塔的每层都绘有佛家精彩壁画，人物造型与画面色调优美绚丽。然而，十多年前，佛像被熔为铜水，壁画也尽遭破坏。
    如今这座佛塔已修缮开放了，当然，铜佛不会再有了，换上了泥塑，壁画也是重新绘制的，基本恢复了原来的面貌，外观依旧是那样庄严神奇。
