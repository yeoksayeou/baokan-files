Li Peng Meets and Dines with Nixon

Li Peng Says the Only Principle That Works in International Relations Is the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence

Nixon Says Common Interests Between the U.S. and China Can Bind the Two Countries Together

	BEIJING, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met with former U.S. President Richard Nixon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this evening. The two sides had an in-depth discussion on the international situation and Sino-U.S. relations.

	Nixon happily recalled the development of U.S.-China relations. He said that there are still common interests between the U.S. and China, and these interests can bind the two countries together.

	Li Peng briefed the guest on China's domestic situation and development policies.

	He said that China will not change its policy of reform and opening up due to the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. However, there are completely different understandings of reform and opening up between the Chinese people and some people in the West. China believes that its reform is the self-improvement of the socialist system. We believe in Marxism because we agree with its stand, views, methods, and philosophical thoughts. Of course, Marxism must be combined with China's realities. But some people in the West think that China's reform is to introduce a market economy and gradually turn public ownership into private ownership. This is inaccurate and misunderstands China's economic policies. China does not practice a completely planned economy or a completely market economy. China will practice a combination of planned economy and market regulation.

	After the meeting, Premier Li Peng hosted a dinner for Mr. Nixon.

	At the banquet, Premier Li Peng, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended a warm welcome to Mr. Nixon's sixth visit to China.

	Li Peng said, 17 years ago, Mr. Nixon, together with the late Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, opened the door to Sino-U.S. relations under very difficult circumstances, ushering in a new situation in the relations between the two countries and bringing about favorable changes in the international political landscape. At that time, the two countries had been isolated from each other for more than 20 years, and their political views and ideologies were diametrically opposed. They had serious disagreements on almost all major international issues. Under such circumstances, it was indeed a manifestation of the foresight of the two countries' politicians to see and find common interests, turn confrontation into cooperation, and establish and develop mutually beneficial relations.

	He said that since Mr. Nixon's first visit to China in 1972, Sino-U.S. relations have made remarkable progress, and the international situation has also undergone profound changes. The old international political and economic order no longer meets the needs of the development of the situation. History has already presented us with the task of establishing a new international political and economic order. The history of post-war international relations has proven that bloc politics do not work, power politics do not work, interference in the internal affairs of other countries does not work, and imposing one's own values on others does not work. The only thing that can work is the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Only peaceful coexistence can bring stability to the world; only equal and mutually beneficial cooperation can help solve the development problems facing the world. China and the United States are both major countries and can make a significant contribution to promoting world peace and development. Maintaining a constructive and good relationship between China and the United States on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is in the interests of both China and the United States, as well as in the interests of the peoples of the world.

	Li Peng said that the development of Sino-U.S. relations over the past 17 years has been generally satisfactory. Although there have been twists and turns and problems, they have been overcome through the joint efforts of both sides. This shows that there are indeed common interests between China and the United States, which is the fundamental driving force for the development of relations between the two countries. At the same time, we have never denied that there are huge differences between China and the United States in terms of social systems and ideologies. However, these differences have not hindered the establishment and development of Sino-U.S. relations in the past, and they should not and will not become obstacles to maintaining and developing Sino-U.S. relations in the present and future. The key is that both sides should strictly adhere to the guiding principles for handling relations between the two countries as stipulated in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués. At present, Sino-U.S. relations are in a difficult situation, which is not something we have caused, nor is it something we would like to see. The key to solving the problem is in the hands of the U.S. side. China has an old saying, "Seek common ground while reserving differences." As long as both sides adhere to the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and each side reserves its own position on issues of disagreement while working together to develop common interests, the difficulties between China and the United States can be easily overcome. If the U.S. side takes any positive action, the Chinese side will welcome and respond to it.

	He said that at present, Sino-U.S. relations are at a critical moment. Far-sighted leaders and politicians should actively seek ways to overcome difficulties from the perspective of the long-term interests of the two countries. We would like to see the restoration and development of Sino-U.S. relations. But this does not depend solely on us.

	Li Peng stressed that the recent Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee established a new leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. This leadership collective is strong and united. China's political situation is stable.

	He said that the reform and opening up, which began 10 years ago, has achieved tremendous results. Practice has proven that this policy is in the interests of all the people of China, and we will continue to implement it unswervingly. At present, China's economy has encountered some difficulties, and we have adopted the policy of rectification and deepening of reform, which has shown initial results after more than a year of implementation. With the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, we will definitely overcome the temporary difficulties and make the national economy develop continuously, steadily, and harmoniously. We are full of confidence in this.

	He said that our starting point for developing the economy is self-reliance, but we have always attached great importance to developing international economic, technological, and trade exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, including introducing advanced technology, management experience, and a certain amount of capital from abroad. Sanctions against China will cause some difficulties for China's economy, but they will not stop our progress, and they will also cause harm to the countries that implement the sanctions.

	Li Peng said in conclusion that Mr. Nixon's visit this time, through extensive exchanges with China's leaders and people from all walks of life, has increased understanding of China's current situation, which is beneficial to the restoration and development of Sino-U.S. relations. I wish this visit a success.

	In his reply, Mr. Nixon thanked Premier Li Peng for his welcome. He said: We are meeting at a delicate moment in Sino-U.S. relations. We must acknowledge our deep differences, but we must also realistically recognize and pursue our common interests.

	He said that the importance of Sino-U.S. relations is clear. The basis of our relations is clear. The reasons for the current difficulties are obvious. We still have common concerns that make Sino-U.S. cooperation an indispensable part of ensuring the happiness of our peoples and promoting world peace and prosperity.

	He said that the challenges ahead are enormous, but the opportunities are also great. Because if we work together, we can create an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity for our peoples.

	He said that China has experienced an extraordinary decade of economic growth. In the ten years since Deng Xiaoping launched the reform in 1979, China's per capita income has doubled. China's status in international affairs will continue to rise rapidly.

	Foreign Minister Qian Qichen attended the meeting and the banquet.

　　李鹏会见并宴请尼克松
　　李鹏说国际关系唯一行得通的是和平共处五项原则
　　尼克松说美中存在的共同利益可把两国联系在一起
    新华社北京10月30日电  （记者杨子迪、朱云龙）国务院总理李鹏今天晚上在钓鱼台国宾馆会见了美国前总统尼克松先生。宾主就国际形势和中美关系等问题深入地进行了交谈。
    尼克松愉快地回顾了美中关系发展的历程。他说，目前美中之间依然存在着共同利益。这些利益可以把我们两个国家联系在一起。
    李鹏向客人介绍了中国的国内情况和发展政策。
    他说，中国不会因不久前在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱而改变改革开放政策。但是，对于改革开放，中国人和西方某些人有完全不同的理解。中国认为自己的改革是社会主义制度的自我完善。我们信仰马克思主义是因为我们赞同马克思主义的立场、观点、方法，赞同马克思主义的哲学思想。当然，马克思主义必须同中国的实际相结合。但西方某些人认为，中国的改革就是搞市场经济，把公有制逐渐变成私有制。这不准确，是误解了中国的经济政策。中国既不搞完全的计划经济，也不搞完全的市场经济。中国要搞计划经济与市场调节相结合。
    会见之后，李鹏总理设宴招待尼克松先生。
    李鹏总理在宴会上祝酒时，代表中国政府和人民对尼克松先生第六次访华表示热烈欢迎。
    李鹏说，17年前，尼克松先生和已故的毛泽东主席、周恩来总理一起，在非常困难的情况下打开了中美关系的大门，开辟了两国关系的新局面，使国际政治格局发生了有利于和平与进步的变化。当时，美中两国已经隔绝了20余年，两国的政治观点和意识形态都截然不同，双方几乎对所有重大国际问题的看法都有严重分歧。在这种情况下，能够看清和找到双方共同的利益，化对抗为合作，建立和发展互利的关系，这确实体现了两国政治家的远见卓识。
    他说，自尼克松先生1972年第一次访华以来，中美关系取得了显著的发展，国际形势也发生了深刻变化。旧有的国际政治、经济秩序已不再适应形势发展的需要。历史已向我们提出了建立新的国际政治、经济秩序的课题。战后国际关系的历史已经证明：集团政治行不通，强权政治行不通，干涉别国内政的做法行不通，将自己的价值观念强加于人也行不通。唯一能够行得通的是和平共处五项原则。只有和平共处，世界才能得到稳定；只有平等互利的合作，才有助于解决世界面临的发展问题。中美两国都是大国，可以一起为促进世界的和平与发展事业做出较大的贡献。中美两国在和平共处五项原则的基础上保持建设性的良好关系，既合乎中美两国的利益，也合乎世界人民的利益。
    李鹏说，中美关系过去17年的发展，总的看是令人满意的。虽然也出现过曲折和问题，但经过双方的共同努力都渡过了难关。这说明中美两国之间确实存在着共同利益，这是两国关系得以发展的根本推动力。同时，我们从来不否认，中美两国在社会制度和意识形态方面存在巨大的差别。但是，这种差别过去没有妨碍中美建立和发展关系，现在和将来也不应当成为保持和发展中美关系的障碍。问题的关键在于双方都应严格遵循中美三个联合公报规定的处理相互关系的指导原则。当前，中美关系处于困难的状态，这不是我们造成的，也不是我们所愿意看到的。解决困难的钥匙掌握在美国方面手里。中国有一句老话叫作求同存异。只要双方都遵守互相尊重、互不干涉内政的原则，在有分歧的问题上各自保留自己的立场，同时为发展双方的共同利益而一起努力，中美之间的困难就可以迎刃而解。如果美国方面采取任何积极行动，中国方面将会欢迎和响应。
    他说，目前，中美关系正处在一个关键时刻。具有远见的领导人和政治家都应从两国的长远利益出发，积极寻求克服困难的办法。我们愿意看到中美关系的恢复和发展。但这不只取决于我们方面。
    李鹏强调指出，不久前十三届四中全会确立了以江泽民总书记为核心的新的领导，这个领导集体是坚强的、团结的。中国的政局是稳定的。
    他说，10年前开始实行的改革开放，取得了巨大的成绩。实践证明，这一国策符合全中国人民的利益，我们将坚持不渝地贯彻执行下去。当前，我国经济出现了一些困难，我们为此采取了治理整顿和深化改革的方针，执行一年多来已初见成效。在全国人民的共同努力下，我们一定能够克服暂时困难，使国民经济持续、稳定、协调地发展。我们对此充满信心。
    他说，我们发展经济的立足点是自力更生，但我们历来十分重视在平等互利基础上开展国际经济、技术和贸易往来，包括引进国外先进的技术、管理经验和一定的资金。对中国进行制裁虽然会给中国的经济造成一些困难，但并不能阻挡我们前进，同时也会对实行制裁措施的国家本身造成损害。
    李鹏最后说，尼克松先生这次来访，通过同我国领导人和各界人士的广泛交谈，增进了对我国现实情况的了解，这对恢复和发展中美关系是有益的。我预祝这次访华取得成功。
    尼克松先生在致答辞时，对李鹏总理对他的欢迎表示感谢。他说：我们是在中美关系的微妙时刻进行会晤的。我们要承认我们之间的深刻分歧，同时现实地认清和追求我们共同的利益。
    他说，中美关系的重要性是清晰可见的。我们关系的基础是明确的。我们必须克服目前困难的原因是显而易见的。我们仍有共同关心的问题，它使得中美合作成为确保两国人民幸福、促进世界和平与繁荣事业的不可缺少的组成部分。
    他说，我们面前的挑战是巨大的，但机会也很大。因为我们如果在一起，就能为我们的人民创造一个前所未有的和平与繁荣的时代。
    他说，中国经历了非凡的十年经济增长时期。自1979年邓小平发起改革以来的十年中，中国的人均收入翻了一番。中国在国际事务中的地位将会继续迅速上升。
    外交部长钱其琛参加了会见并出席了宴会。
