Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 25th.

Since the Western stock markets experienced a comprehensive decline on October 13th and 16th, the New York stock market has been volatile and continues to show a downward trend.

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fallen by 216.26 points the previous week, rebounded by 119.88 points, closing at 2689.14 points by the weekend. Since the start of this week, this index has fallen by 26.23 points on the 23rd and 3.69 points on the 24th, closing at 2659.22 points on the 24th.

Analysts believe this is due to investors' concerns about profit losses leading to stock sell-offs.

　　纽约股市仍显降势
    新华社北京10月25日电　自本月13日和16日西方股市全面下跌以来，纽约股票市场行情波动不定，仍显降势。
    上周，纽约道·琼斯30种工业股票平均指数在前一周下跌216.26点后回升了119.88点，到周末收盘时为2689.14点。本周开市以来，这项指数在23日和24日分别下跌了26.23点和3.69点，24日收盘时降为2659.22点。
    分析家认为，这是投资者担心利润受损而抛售股票所致。
