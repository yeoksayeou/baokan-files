Gold and silver are crucial components of a country's foreign exchange reserves and are essential for international trade settlements. However, in recent years, the normal channels for the state to collect gold and silver have been obstructed, and the black market has flourished, leading to severe chaos in the gold and silver exchange market. The reasons for this are as follows:

Propaganda efforts have been insufficient. The State Council issued the "Regulations on the Management of Gold and Silver" on June 15, 1983, which has been in effect for six years. However, except for a few enterprises that produce gold and silver, the vast majority of urban and rural residents are unaware of these regulations. Many people even do not know that the People's Bank of China is the authority managing gold and silver. Most people still believe that with the implementation of reform and opening up, gold and silver can be freely bought and sold like other commodities. This is a significant ideological root cause of the black market. Take Linyi County in Shanxi Province, for example, which historically had the largest amount of gold and silver exchange in the country. At its peak, the county exchanged over 10,000 grams of gold, over 120 kilograms of silver, and over 13,000 silver dollars annually. However, since 1987, the county's banks have not handled a single gold exchange transaction, and the amount of silver exchanged is negligible.

Services are lagging behind. Currently, there are few gold and silver exchange personnel at the grassroots level of banks, and their quality is low. They often refuse to handle transactions brought to them because they cannot determine the purity and authenticity of the items.

Prices are unreasonable. The current price of gold is 48 yuan per gram, and the price of silver dollars is 20 yuan each, both of which are significantly lower than international market prices and the prices of gold and silver jewelry. Unscrupulous individuals buy these items at low prices and then resell them for a profit, causing the prices of gold and silver in the black market to continue to rise, leading to a large amount of gold and silver being circulated outside the official channels.

Prices are unstable. Currently, some people in society believe that with the continuous rise in market prices, it is more beneficial to store gold and silver than to save money. Therefore, buying gold and silver has become a trend, with those who have money buying it, and those who do not having money trying to borrow money to buy it.

Management is chaotic. The "Regulations on the Management of Gold and Silver of the People's Republic of China" clearly stipulate that the People's Bank of China is the state authority managing gold and silver. However, in reality, some specialized banks and grassroots units of supply and marketing cooperatives, public security, materials, and industrial and commercial administration departments are also engaged in gold and silver exchange business. In recent years, individual silversmiths from Henan, Shandong, and Anhui provinces have appeared in the Yuncheng area of Shanxi Province. These individuals have been engaged in gold and silver processing for a long time. When relevant departments investigated this matter, they strangely found that these individual silversmiths not only held business licenses issued by the local industrial and commercial administrative authorities but also had various introduction letters and certificates issued by the local government.

Enforcement is weak. Since 1987, more than 250 cases of private gold and silver trading and smuggling activities have been discovered in Linyi County. Although relevant departments have taken measures to crack down on these activities multiple times, the black market for gold and silver has not only not been eliminated but has become even more active.

　　金银收兑市场混乱探源
    金银是国家重要的外汇储备，是国际贸易的清算手段。然而，近几年来，国家正常的金银收兑渠道受阻，民间黑市猖獗，金银收兑市场出现了严重混乱。究其原因有以下几点：
    宣传不力。国务院1983年6月15日发布了金银管理条例，至今已有6年之久，但除个别生产金银的企业外，绝大多数城乡居民对此根本不了解，有的甚至连中国人民银行是金银管理机关也不知晓。大多数人还认为实行改革开放，金银也可以和其它商品一样自由买卖，这是形成民间黑市的一个重要思想根源。就拿山西省历史上民间金银收兑量最多的临猗县来说，最多一年收兑黄金1万余克，白银120多公斤，银元13000多枚。但1987年以来，该县银行从未办理过一笔黄金收兑业务，收兑白银也微乎其微。
    服务落后。目前基层银行金银收兑人员少，素质低，对送上门的生意因不能确定其成色和真假而拒之门外。
    价格不合理。现行黄金价格每克48元，银元每枚20元，明显低于国际市场价和金银首饰出售价。不法分子廉价收回，转手倒卖，牟取暴利，使得民间金银价格越涨越高，造成大量金银“体外循环”。
    物价不稳。当前社会上一些人认为，目前市场物价不断上涨，储存金银物品比参加储蓄合算，于是抢购金银一度成风，有钱的买，没有钱的也设法借钱买。
    管理混乱。《中华人民共和国金银管理条例》明文规定：中国人民银行是国家管理金银的机关，但事实上，目前一些专业银行以及供销、公安、物资、工商管理等部门的基层机构，也进行着收兑金银业务。近几年来，山西运城地区出现了来自河南、山东和安徽的个体银匠，他们长期以加工金银为业，当有关部门查及此事时，奇怪地发现这些个体银匠，不仅持有当地工商行政管理局签发的营业执照，而且还有当地政府出具的各种介绍信、证明信。
    打击不力。1987年以来，在临猗县共发现民间私自买卖金银物品及金银走私活动的就有250多起。尽管有关部门曾多次采取打击措施，但金银黑市非但没被取缔，而且愈来愈活跃。　（10月9日《中国消费者报》杨兆忠　张中平文）
