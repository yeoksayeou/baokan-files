Over 100 Overseas Chinese in Norway Protest Nobel Peace Prize Awarded to Dalai Lama

Today, representatives of Chinese residents in Norway submitted a letter signed by over 100 Chinese people to the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee, strongly protesting the committee's decision to award the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama.

The protest letter stated that the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee's decision "will only incite unrest and encourage the separation of China." It also said that the decision "will create division and hatred within the Chinese nation."

The letter emphasized: "Tibet has been an inseparable part of Chinese territory since ancient times. The Tibetan people and other ethnic minorities are all members of the Chinese nation, just as the Lapland region and other areas inhabited by the Sami people in northern Norway belong to Norway. We believe that the Nobel Peace Prize Committee would not want to award the peace prize to a Sami person who seeks to separate the aforementioned regions from Norway."

The letter praised the late Panchen Lama, noting that he had done much constructive work during his lifetime and "truly chose the path of non-violence and cooperation."

The over 100 Chinese people demanded that the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee carefully reconsider and immediately rescind the aforementioned erroneous decision.

　　百余名旅挪华人联名写信
　　抗议把诺贝尔和平奖给予达赖
    本报斯德哥尔摩10月20日电　记者顾耀铭报道：今天上午旅居挪威的华人代表将100多名华人联名签署的一封抗议信递交给挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会，强烈抗议该委员会将今年的诺贝尔和平奖给予达赖。
    抗议信指出，挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会作出这样错误的决定“只会煽动骚乱、鼓励分裂中国”，“在中华民族大家庭中制造分裂和仇恨”。
    信中严肃指出：“西藏自古以来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分。藏族和其它少数民族都是中华民族大家庭的成员，正如芬玛克郡和挪威北部其他拉普族人居住的地区属于挪威一样。我们相信诺贝尔和平奖委员会不会愿意将和平奖授予一个想把上述地区从挪威分裂出去的拉普人。”
    信中赞扬了已故的班禅喇嘛，认为他生前作了许多建设性的工作，“真正选择了非暴力和合作的道路”。
    这100多名华人要求挪威诺贝尔和平奖委员会慎重考虑，立即收回上述错误的决定。
