Xi'an Institute of Technology severely violated national policies during this year's recruitment process by unauthorizedly enrolling non-planned undergraduate classes. The State Education Commission recently issued a notice and conducted a serious investigation into the matter.

The notice pointed out that in July of this year, Xi'an Institute of Technology, without seeking approval, decided to establish non-planned, fee-charging undergraduate classes. The duration of study was set at two years, with teaching organized according to the specialized curriculum. The institute sent out recruitment brochures to several provinces and regions, stating: "Upon completion of the study period and passing all required courses, a graduation certificate issued by the institute will be awarded." It was confirmed that six departments and one basic department of the institute had established such classes this year. Students came from provinces and regions including Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Henan, Shanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Hubei. Humanities students were required to pay 1,000 yuan per academic year, while science students paid 1,100 yuan. To attract more students, the institute also offered a reward of 30 yuan for each student recommended by an individual or organization. It is understood that by the end of September, the institute had enrolled 421 students beyond the planned quota.

The State Education Commission recently decided:

1. The non-planned undergraduate classes enrolled by Xi'an Institute of Technology in the past two years must be immediately discontinued. The institute is responsible for all subsequent arrangements.
2. Until 1991, the institute's authority to issue graduation certificates and degree certificates will be suspended. During this period, any form of graduation certificate or degree certificate issued by the institute must be stamped by the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Higher Education to be valid.
3. It is suggested that the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics Industry impose disciplinary action on the individuals directly responsible for the unauthorized decision to enroll non-planned students.

It is understood that the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics Industry has decided to give the president of the affiliated Xi'an Institute of Technology an administrative warning.

　　违反政策擅招计划外大专班  西安工学院被通报批评
　　院长受到行政警告处分
    据新华社北京电  西安工业学院在今年招生过程中严重违反国家有关政策，擅自招收计划外大专班，日前国家教委就这个问题发出通报，并进行了严肃处理。
    教委的通报指出，今年七月，西安工业学院不经请示，擅自决定举办计划外收费大专班，规定学习时间为二年，按专科教学计划组织教学。这个学院在发给若干省区的计划外《招生简章》中规定：“学习期满，修完教学计划规定的全部课程，考试合格，发给学院委托培训毕业证书。”经核实，这个学院六个系一个基础部今年均举办了这种类型的班。学生来自陕西、江苏、河南、山西、甘肃、新疆、湖北等省区。文科学生每学年交学费一千元，理科交一千一百元。为多招学生，这个学院还规定，个人或单位每推荐一名学生，可得三十元的报酬。据了解，到九月底，学院已超计划录取了四百二十一名学生。
    国家教委最近决定：
    一、西安工业学院去年和今年招收的计划外大专班必须立即停办，学院应负责一切善后工作。二、一九九一年以前，停止西安工业学院单独发放毕业证书和学位证书的权力。在此期间，该院发放任何形式的毕业证书和学位证书必须经陕西省高教局验印后，方为有效。三、建议机械电子工业部对该院擅自决定计划外招生的直接责任者给予纪律处分。
    据了解，机械电子部已决定对所属西安工业学院院长给予行政警告处分。
