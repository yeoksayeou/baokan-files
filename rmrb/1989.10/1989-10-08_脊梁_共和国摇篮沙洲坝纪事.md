The cradle of the People's Republic of China, the embryonic form of the Chinese Soviet Republic, was born in this place 58 years ago. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Provisional Central Government of the Soviet Union all gathered here, making this tiny dot on the map a place of global attention.

However, perhaps no one noticed that this cradle of the republic, 30 years after the victory of the revolution, when a brigade was divided into two, the brigade that erected a stone tablet beside the "Red Well" reading "Never forget the well-diggers" ended up with 40,000 yuan in debt. Even more unbelievable was that the money to carve the party branch seal, a symbol of power, was borrowed from a private individual!

Ten years later, this party branch that borrowed money to carve the seal suddenly leaped from the depths to become one of the nation's advanced grassroots party organizations. The spirit of reform and opening up and the spirit of hard work forged a sharp blade here, bidding farewell to poverty. The people of the republic's cradle, who had once slumped, stood tall again.

This sacred but once impoverished place is called Sandzhou Dam, located outside Ruyin City, Jiangxi.

Looking Back with a Smile

After the failure of the fifth counter-encirclement campaign by the Red Army, soldiers who had hastily withdrawn from the smoky battlefield shed tears as they bid farewell to the capital of the Soviet Republic and headed west...

Bloodshed and turmoil, endless nights. The flag of the People's Republic finally rose in Beijing. When the great leader Mao Zedong, who had dug a well in Sandzhou Dam, declared in Beijing that "the Chinese people have stood up," the people of Sandzhou Dam, after cheering, quickly lay down exhausted.

Indeed, the people of Sandzhou Dam were too tired. After the Red Army left, the cradle of the republic shook day and night, and the people in the cradle never slept a peaceful night. Not only were they tired, but they had paid too much for today's victory.

In those days, to "expand the 100,000-strong iron army," Mao Zetang's wife, He Yi, mobilized 7,000 people from the 15,000-strong Sandzhou Township to head west. Later, in the village of Sandzhou, which had fewer than 100 households, 18 families were known for their loyalty, and the 52 widows who had lost their Red Army husbands used their youth to build sacred memorials.

The people of the cradle of the republic naturally deserved to rest and recuperate. However, for many years, time and poverty were still companions here.

Under the scorching sun, Yang Xiangzi, a descendant of a martyr, sprayed poisonous pesticides in the rice fields beside the Red Well. Suddenly, "click," a foreign reporter took a photo and published it abroad. The "exported" image shocked Zhongnanhai.

Thus, a batch of relief cotton cloth was allocated, and each person in Sandzhou Dam received two feet of blue cloth to cover their shame...

During the spring famine, Yang Zhanqing, a descendant of the Red Army, fainted while plowing the fields in front of Mao Zedong's former residence and fell into the water. As people carried him home, they encountered a group of foreign visitors. "Click!" Another photo brought in tens of thousands of pounds of relief grain.

However, to curry favor, the leaders of the commune revolutionary committee, under the slogan "Are you suffering? Think of the 250,000," resolutely held the red flag stained with the blood of martyrs and beat the drums that had once sent their sons to join the Red Army. They rushed to the county to report their achievements: Inside the Great Hall of the Chinese Soviet Republic, we have 100,000 jin of reserve grain in Sandzhou Dam. In fact, there was not a single grain of rice in the hall, only hungry rats chasing each other...

Anyone who has been to Sandzhou Dam shakes their head at the barren soil without a single blade of grass. In fact, the people of Sandzhou Dam also feel guilty and ashamed.

"We can't let Chairman Mao down anymore!"

Thus, the people of Sandzhou Dam mixed pig's blood and red dye with sweat and tears to build a "red wall," separating Mao Zedong's former residence, the Red Well, and the villagers' dilapidated houses, blocking the eyes and ears of foreigners and leaders.

From then on, the people of Sandzhou Dam shrank behind the high red wall, waiting for favors from above. In those days that were hard to recall, a series of life scenes remained in people's memories: In winter, a line of men sat on fire baskets under the sun, gnawing on sweet potatoes by the red wall. A family that moved into a new village built by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1958 suffered a fire. People advised the head of the household to lead his four tall and strong sons to rebuild the house with self-reliance. They advised for five years, but the head of the household waited for relief from above for five years, until his death, he did not move a single brick or tile. The orphan Yang Gengzi would grab a handful of government-issued cotton wadding every day to exchange for alcohol, drinking until his home was bare, and every night he would hug his pillow, thinking of his estranged wife. In the old temple where the "Economic Construction Conference of the Northern Eleven Counties of the Central Soviet Area" was once held, when the head of Sandzhou Township announced to the 1,071 households of the township that they had been evaluated as "impoverished households," the audience, after a few seconds of surprise, burst into thunderous applause...

Ah, impoverished Sandzhou Dam, the historical relics still shine with a sacred light on you, still attracting countless domestic and foreign tourists. The Red Well remains, but a glorious history has already settled in this "sacred well." The iron bell that hung on the three branches of the ancient camphor tree in the village, which once sounded the alarm, is silent, as if pondering the undeniable reality of decline. It is silent but has not closed its eyes. It has witnessed history and will witness the future. It waits in silence to ring again, to shake people's hearts and the countryside with its resonant voice!

The Bell Rings Again

The sound of the historical wheel awakened the people of Sandzhou Dam from their dream of lying on the merit book left by their ancestors with empty stomachs. The sense of crisis made a group of Communist Party members in the village suddenly wake up.

Yang Xuxing, the man who had to borrow money to carve the seal as soon as he took office, was a sturdy man with a square face and broad shoulders. Every black hair on his flat head seemed to inherit the tenacity of his grandfather, who was a soldier in the Red Army, and his father, who was a member of the Red Guard. In 1972, he completely ignored the regulation that Sandzhou Dam did not recruit soldiers after liberation and, after arguing with the commander of the recruitment team, entered the "great furnace." After returning home from the army, on January 1, 1979, just a few days after the historic Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, this 26-year-old descendant of a martyr was elected as the party branch secretary of Sandzhou Dam. When the seal, carved with borrowed money, was in his and his six branch committee members' hands, all under 30 years old, a unique reform plan was introduced: use part of the poverty alleviation funds to set up small enterprises and arrange the labor force of the poverty alleviation objects in the enterprises. However, his "reform" was met with a barrage of criticism. Villagers who valued immediate benefits and were used to an egalitarian lifestyle did not care about the effectiveness of the use of poverty alleviation funds and unanimously demanded that he distribute the poverty alleviation funds evenly to the entire village like scattering pepper.

"Damn it, I'll go make money on my own!" Yang Xuxing, in a fit of anger, went to the credit cooperative to borrow money and bought a "Harvest-27" truck to start a transportation business. In two months, the average monthly profit was over a thousand yuan. Soon, he exchanged it for a "Dongfeng" truck. As the truck drove out of the village, he deliberately honked the horn loudly. The eyes of the people of Sandzhou Dam finally showed something unusual. Yang Xuxing was proud, and his keen mind made him the first transportation specialist in Ruyin County.

However, the strange changes outside made him even more surprised. He could show off in the village with his "Dongfeng," but outside, he seemed so helpless. He went to Beijing and bought goods from a store, but the saleswoman couldn't even write the three characters "Sandzhou Dam." He told her that there was a lesson in the second-grade textbook about "Remembering the Well-Diggers" and the story of Chairman Mao digging a well in Sandzhou Dam. The salesgirl replied, "I only read 'Frog in the Well.'" So, Yang Xuxing hoped the girl would know about the red capital of Ruyin, but the girl said she only knew about the capital Beijing. As for his explanation that his place was a famous old revolutionary base, she shook her head and said she only knew about the famous Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.

Yang Xuxing felt a humiliation he had never experienced before. Whether it was his wounded pride or the identity of the party branch leader that made him suddenly wake up, Yang Xuxing got off the "Dongfeng" after driving it for a month. Looking back now, it's hard to say if the girl was deliberately provoking him. But the fact that the Red Well and the Red Capital had lost their place in the minds of contemporary people is certain! Just look, with the two words "Yan'an," people think of cave dwellings and yellow earth; with the two words "Ruyin," people think of mud houses and red soil. How similar! However, history chose these two poor places to be revolutionary holy lands, to be the cradle of the republic! But today, besides the revolutionary sites and poverty for people to visit, what else can be shown off?!

The proud party branch secretary of Sandzhou Dam was deeply shocked, and his sense of honor vanished in an instant. He suddenly realized that he was a son of Sandzhou Dam, and his personal fate was tightly bound to the Sandzhou Dam that raised him. Even if he became a millionaire and got rich, at most, he was just a businessman seeking profit. He realized that he had indeed become a "frog in the well." The sense of responsibility and mission of a Communist made him realize: he should break free from the constraints of the "well" and step into a broader world.

On a moonlit spring night, 74 Communist Party members gathered in the low, rammed-earth meeting room of the village committee. Yang Xuxing, with a heavy heart, both admonished himself and the comrades rubbing their sleepy eyes:

Look at the outside world, the train of the times has long left us behind, and we, the "darlings" of the revolutionary war years, have become the "abandoned children" of the commodity economy. In the past, heroes emerged from this place, but now have we all become nameless rats? In the past, our ancestors dared to risk their lives for the revolution, but do we, in this generation, not even dare to hold the "official hat" in our hands to seek wealth? My good brothers, if we don't wake up from our stupor, we will perish in our stupor!

A few words that pierced the heart made the party members present feel as if they had drunk a bowl of invigorating wine, and their slumped spines stood straight. The echoes of history resonated in their hearts. They wanted to stand up, and they would stand up, standing at the intersection of history and the future, using the spirit of the new era to ring the silent bell.

Burn, the Fire of Struggle

In the early 1930s, this land of blood saw five military "encirclements and suppressions." Now, the Sandzhou Dam party branch is organizing an extraordinary "encirclement and suppression"—leading the villagers to break out of the circle of poverty.

In early 1985, Yang Xuxing resolutely stopped the new "Dongfeng" that had been running day and night and reunited with the six village committee members. Yang Xuxing's keen instincts told him that the red soil beneath their feet, soaked with the blood of martyrs, would not only produce poverty but also wealth. It needed an Aladdin's magic lamp to open the door to the buried treasures.

After investigation and analysis, they quickly wrote a feasibility report for setting up a medium-sized building materials factory. They were very clear that setting up a factory would be more difficult than leading poverty alleviation relief materials and then distributing them, because according to the draft feasibility report, the budget amount was 400,000 yuan, which was an astronomical figure for the impoverished people of Sandzhou Dam.

A single penny can defeat a hero, let alone tens of thousands. Yang Xuxing had no choice but to seek bank loans. However, loans required guarantees, and he ran to the county and township enterprises, but no one was willing to take the risk for the people of Sandzhou Dam who relied on state relief.

"Not relying on gods or emperors, relying on ourselves." This song that roused countless pioneers also roused Yang Xuxing. He decided to risk it all and sent committee members Yang Jinqing and Yang Shuquan to the Shanhaiguan Pass to order brick-making equipment. A few days later, Shanhaiguan sent one telegram after another, urging the payment of 50,000 yuan to take delivery.

Yang Xuxing, holding five urgent telegrams, said to the village party branch members, "In the past, the Red Army promised the farmers here, and the farmers enthusiastically joined the army and fought; in the early days of liberation, the party and the government fulfilled their promises, and the farmers received land, houses, and oxen, and the farmers supported the party and the government. Today, what can we give the people? Decades have passed, and the people are still poor! We are all Communist Party members, and Communist Party members should have a sense of crisis! This term of the branch committee must throw the village's poor hat into the 'Java Sea.' Now, setting up a factory requires a loan, but no one is willing to guarantee it for us. What should we do? Living people can't be suffocated by urine. We must jump out of the 'dependence' swamp, not relying on gods or emperors, relying on ourselves to save ourselves, using the property of the party branch members to guarantee the bank!"

Yang Xuxing was the first to mortgage his "Dongfeng" truck, and the other members of the battle fortress also fearlessly mortgaged their most valuable property—their houses. The decisive action finally won the bank's trust, and the 50,000 yuan loan was quickly remitted to Shanhaiguan.

Just like the "expansion of the Red Army" in the past, everyone was mobilized—

The party members and cadres took the lead, stipulating that each person should raise at least 1,000 yuan. Yang Xuxing sold his "Dongfeng" truck and contributed 5,000 yuan himself. Village head Yang Jinqing, who had just returned from Shanhaiguan, turned his house upside down but still couldn't raise 100 yuan in cash. What to do? He thought and thought but couldn't find a way, so he opened the granary and picked 200 jin of rice to sell. However, the few dozen yuan from 200 jin of rice were of no use. When he was about to carry the rice out of the village again, Yang Xuxing, with tears in his eyes, stopped him. That was the food for a family of several people! For the food in their mouths, the people of Sandzhou Dam had been troubled for decades, and now they needed money again, but they couldn't cut flesh to fill a wound! However, Yang Jinqing did not accept Yang Xuxing's care. He thought that as a committee member, he could not be an exception, and he borrowed from relatives and friends, finally borrowing 12 tons of cement from a relative who was preparing to build a house to pour the foundation beams of the building materials factory.

The party members who were specialized households used their "wealth" to take on large projects such as offices, rain shelters, and coal sheds. The old village head of Sandzhou Dam, who had once named it by Mao Zedong, worked tirelessly, going from house to house, mobilizing old Red Army soldiers to raise funds. Yang Shiliang and more than 30 other old Red Army soldiers, seeing the enthusiasm of the young party members, were deeply moved and voluntarily deducted 50 yuan from their monthly salaries as investment. The widows of martyrs and the red relatives in the nursing home also took a "forward" action. They poured out all the government subsidies they had saved and prepaid the electricity bill, even paying it to the year 2000.

To open up more channels for raising funds, the party branch stipulated that each worker entering the factory should bring 300 yuan. Then, they borrowed 700,000 yuan from specialized households. The committee members led the villagers to use four small kilns to bake 12 million bricks urgently needed for the factory, saving nearly 800,000 yuan.

The people of Sandzhou Dam, in pursuit of a better tomorrow, once again accompanied the historical bell, singing a new song of reform.

The machines were finally safely returned to Sandzhou Dam.

However, there was no crane, and it was difficult to unload the huge mixers, roller mills, and extruders from the truck! However, difficulties did not scare the people of Sandzhou Dam. Although they lacked money, they had plenty of strength.

"Hey! Hey!" With strength to move mountains and spirit to cover the world! The people of Sandzhou Dam, with their iron shoulders, got to work. They stood under the blue sky and red soil, straightened their backs.

The factory building was built, and the first 54-meter-high industrial chimney in the village was erected. The enthusiasm of the people of Sandzhou Dam was ignited.

On January 4, 1986, the newly built building materials factory's rotary kiln was about to be fired. As if it were a festival, drums and gongs were beaten, and the string of high-flying firecrackers exploded enthusiastically. The entire village gathered in front of the kiln, extremely excited, watching the county magistrate cut the ribbon for the firing.

The kiln fire was lit, and the flames roared.

Yang Xuxing and the other committee members, who had eaten boiled water for three months and had not left the construction site of the building materials factory day or night, were all in high spirits. However, when people were intoxicated with the joy of victory, the kiln fire mercilessly went out. Like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, people's laughter turned into beads of cold sweat on their foreheads. Yang Xuxing's heart turned cold, standing in front of the kiln like a withered grass. His confidence and joy were swept away by disappointment.

The second time, with a pounding heart, the kiln was fired. The entire scene was as silent as the ebb tide, with various complex emotions intertwined, making people anxious.

It seemed that the goddess of fate did not want to easily bestow the fruit of success on this group of poor and hungry but stubborn people who hoped to change their fate. This time, the firing also failed. When the unformed bricks were unloaded, it was found that the top bricks of the kiln had been corroded by the steam that could not be discharged from the kiln, leaving thousands of holes. This time, 200,000 bricks were scrapped.

Men do not shed tears lightly, only when they reach the point of heartbreak. Those 200,000 bricks, when baked, were 16,000 yuan! The hard work of the past few months was enough to wash away poverty! The nearly 200,000 yuan of raised funds was even more the hope that the entire village of party members, the masses, and even the old Red Army and old red relatives had scraped together. Now the hope fire was extinguished, would the masses still believe us? Could the prestige of the party branch be restored?... Thinking of these things, the seven comrades in the committee hugged each other and cried in the kiln hole. Cry, cry your heart out. Perhaps only crying is the best release?

Yang Xuxing cried and suddenly wiped away the tears from his eyes, "tang tang tang" walked to the ancient camphor tree in front of Mao Zedong's former residence, where the iron bell was hanging, and madly "dong dong dong" rang the iron bell that sounded the alarm during the war years. Like signal flares rising in the dark night, the resonant bell sound gathered all the people of Sandzhou Dam. They trusted Yang Xuxing and trusted the party branch. When Yang Xuxing, with tears, told his fellow villagers that the second firing had also failed, the possible cause was that the kiln was too wet, and asked them what to do, the villagers shouted in unison: "Burn fire to dry it!" So, everyone quickly carried bundles of straw from their homes and stuffed them into the kiln hole to burn fire to dry the kiln.

What good people, the blood of the martyrs and the Red Army soldiers undoubtedly flowed in the people of Sandzhou Dam.

When 200,000 bricks were refilled and the third fire was lit, the flames that had experienced setbacks and hardships rushed forward, soared, expanded, and finally ignited the fire of hope, the fire of success!

From History to the Future

From the start of construction to the end of 1988, three years later, the Sandzhou Dam Village Building Materials Factory not only repaid all the borrowed debts but also paid 600,000 yuan in taxes last year. The factory's 166 workers had an average annual salary of 800 yuan. 800 yuan, for the people of Sandzhou Dam, was indeed a significant figure. It is known that until 1980, the annual per capita net income here was only 78 yuan, and before 1980, the 760 households and 3,600 people of Sandzhou Dam each received 50 yuan of relief grain (goods) per person per year, equivalent to their annual net income from their own production. 800 yuan was undoubtedly a significant leap, and it brought about a spiritual leap for the people of Sandzhou Dam.

In a few years, Sandzhou Dam Village, through self-reliance, set up a building materials factory, a steel rolling mill, a pesticide factory, a fruit and tea plantation, a quarry, a sand pit, a power station, an irrigation station... Among the 1,100 laborers in the village, 726 have become workers, of whom 70% were originally "double support" objects.

A few years of hard work began to yield bountiful results. Sandzhou Dam Village's industrial output value reached 1.8 million yuan last year. The village now has six cars, more than 30 tractors and small four-wheel vehicles, and the products of a private pearl embroidery processing factory have gone abroad. The 8,500 mu of barren mountains in the village have begun to turn green, and 500 mu of citrus fruits are heavy on the branches. After the implementation of the production responsibility system, the two reservoirs of Wugongdian and Zhangyi and the Dabuqiao Irrigation Station, built on the Shizhongkeng and Shizhongkeng, changed the bad natural conditions of "three days without rain, no water to wash your handkerchief," and the people of Sandzhou Dam finally bid farewell to the sweet potato pulp that would cause acid reflux as soon as it entered the stomach. In 1988, the per capita net income of the entire village reached 509 yuan, equivalent to ten times that of ten years ago.

The people of Sandzhou Dam, who had worn the hat of poverty for countless generations, finally threw it into the "Java Sea" in this generation. Led by the party branch, the people of the cradle of the republic spread their wings and began to fly towards prosperity.

The change in material conditions brought about a change in spiritual appearance. The people of Sandzhou Dam are also truly rich in spirit. They obtain more wealth information and scientific knowledge from numerous newspapers and magazines. They observe the world beyond Sandzhou Dam from the glow of the television screen. They fully realize the role of culture in transforming human quality, and the village committee allocates a considerable sum of money to the "Lenin Primary School" in the village every year. Now, this primary school has become the best-equipped school for rural education in the county. The enrollment rate of school-age children in the village has reached 98%.

The people of Sandzhou Dam have entered the kaleidoscope of life. Although they do not have the style of coastal people and do not have the scenery of special economic zones, the people of Sandzhou Dam, who live in the cradle of the republic, are indeed moving towards prosperity and chasing hope.

Walking past the Red Well, walking past the site of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic, walking past the bullet-shaped martyrs' memorial tower in Yeping, walking past the red brick road of the Red Army Square, with the prominent words "Advancing on the blood of the martyrs!" embedded in it.

Yang Xuxing, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, carried the trust of the entire village from the red capital of yesterday to the capital of today, and proudly attended the National Advanced Grassroots Party Organizations and Outstanding Party Affairs Workers Commendation Conference.

Of course, he was no longer like the people of Sandzhou Dam ten years ago, traveling thousands of miles to Beijing to ask the heroes of the republic for "promises." He wanted to tell people that the history of lying down to ask for "promises" had ended, and the chapter of standing up and striving for self-improvement had been reopened. The people of the cradle of the republic had not brought shame to the republic; they were still towering giants after straightening their backs!

    脊梁
    ——共和国摇篮沙洲坝纪事
    李春荣　罗荣　杨遵贤
    58年前，中华人民共和国的雏型——中华苏维埃共和国在这块地方诞生。中共中央局、中央军委、苏维埃临时中央政府云集于此，于是，这个地图上找不到的小不点一下子成为世界瞩目的地方。
    然而，也许谁也没有去注意，这个共和国的摇篮，在革命胜利了整整30年之后，在由一个大队分成两个大队时，那个在“红井”旁竖了一块“吃水不忘挖井人”的石碑大队，分得的财产竟是4000元债务；更加难以相信的是，刻那枚权力象征的党支部公章的钱，竟是从私人那里借来的！
    十年后的今天，这个借钱刻印把子的党支部，忽然从低谷一跃成为全国先进基层党组织。那改革开放的精灵与艰苦奋斗的精神聚合锻造的利刃，使这里与贫困告别，生活在共和国摇篮里的人曾经一度瘫软的脊梁重新挺直。
    这个神圣而又曾经贫困的地方，在江西瑞金城外，名叫沙洲坝。
    回眸难笑
    红军第五次反围剿失败之后，一队队从硝烟弥漫的战场仓促撤下的红军士兵拖着沉重的步履洒泪惜别苏维埃共和国首都，向西而去……
    腥风血雨，漫漫长夜。人民共和国的旗帜终于在北京升起来了。当在沙洲坝挖了一口红井的伟人毛泽东在北京宣告“中国人民从此站起来了”的时候，生活在共和国摇篮里的沙洲坝人在欢呼之后，却又很快疲乏地躺下了。
    是啊，沙洲坝人太困乏了。红军撤走后共和国摇篮日夜震荡，摇篮里的人从未睡过一个安稳觉。岂止太乏，为了今天的胜利，他们付出太多太多。
    当年为“扩大100万铁的红军”，毛泽覃的妻子贺怡在只有1.5万人的沙洲坝乡鼓动了7000人向西而去。之后，不足百户的沙洲坝村满门忠烈就有18家，那牺牲了红军郎的52名寡妇，更是用自己的青春铸就了一座座神圣的纪念碑。
    共和国摇篮里的人们，理所当然地该休养生息了。然而，多少年来。这里仍是光阴与贫困相伴。
    炎炎烈日，只穿一条破裤衩的烈士后代杨香仔在红井旁的稻田里喷洒剧毒农药，突然，“咔嚓”一声，一位前来参观的外国记者拍下了这张照片，并带出国外发表。“出口转内销”的“形象”震动了首都中南海。
    于是，一批救济棉布拨了下来，沙洲坝人人均分得两尺蓝布用以遮羞……
    春荒时节。红军后代杨占庆在毛主席旧居前犁田时，饿昏扑倒在水田里，众人把他抬回家的路上，恰遇一队外宾走过，“咔嚓！”，又是一张照片引来了数万斤救济粮。
    然而，为了邀功的公社革委会领导在“苦不苦，想想两万五”口号的激励下，毅然举着那面沾有烈士鲜血的红旗，敲着当年送郎当红军的锣鼓，跑到县上报捷：在中华苏维埃共和国大礼堂内，我们沙洲坝储有战备粮100万斤。其实，礼堂内粮食颗粒无存，有的只是饥鼠追逐……
    凡是到过沙洲坝的人，谁不为这毫无草木掩饰的贫瘠土壤摇头？其实，沙洲坝人又何尝不感到内疚与羞愧。
    “不能再给毛主席丢脸了！”
    于是，沙洲坝人用猪血、凡红，拌着汗水和泪水，垒起一堵“红墙”，把毛主席旧居，红井与村民居住的破屋断然隔开，以障外国人乃至首长们的耳目。
    从此，沙洲坝人困缩在高高的红墙内，等待上面的恩赐。不堪回首的日子里，留给人们记忆里一串串生活镜头：冬天，一溜儿男子汉胯下坐着火笼，嘴上啃着蕃薯，在融融太阳下靠着红墙晒肚皮。一户住进1958年由民政部门建的新村中的烈士后代家发生火灾，人们劝说户主率领他的四个牛高马大的儿子发扬自力更生的精神把房子修起来，劝了五年，那位户主等上级救济等了五年，直到死去也没有动一块砖一片瓦。烈士遗孤杨梗子，每天抓一团政府救济的棉絮去换酒喝，直喝得家徒四壁，每晚醉熏熏地抱着枕头想那离了婚的婆娘。在当年召开过“中央苏区北部十一县经济建设大会”的旧祠堂里，当沙洲坝乡乡长向全乡1071户乡民宣布他们已被评上“特困户”时，台下在数秒钟的愕然之后，竟然掌声雷动……
    啊，贫困的沙洲坝，历史的陈迹依然在你身上闪着神圣的光环，依然吸引着络绎不绝的中外游客。红井依旧，然而，一段辉煌的历史，已经在这眼“圣井”中沉淀了。村里那口挂在三枝连理古樟上的当年报警的铁钟缄默不语，仿佛在为不能否认的低落的现实而沉思。它沉默，却没有闭上眼睛，它目睹过历史，也将目睹未来，它于沉默中等待再一次敲响，等待再一次以它宏亮的声音震撼人心，震撼乡村！
    钟声再起
    历史的车轮声惊醒了沙洲坝人饿着肚子躺在父辈遗留下来的功劳簿上做的好梦，危机感更使村里一批共产党员幡然猛醒。
    杨旭星，这个一上任就得去借钱刻公章的人，是个方脸宽腰膀个子墩实的铮铮汉子，他的平头上每根黑发似乎都透出当红军的爷爷、当赤卫队员的父亲遗留下来的坚毅性格。1972年，他全然不顾沙洲坝解放后不征兵的规定，高中毕业就与接兵部队首长吵了一架后走进了“大熔炉”。退伍回乡后，在那个划时代的党的十一届三中全会刚刚开过几天后的1979年1月1日，这个26岁的烈士后代被推选为沙洲坝大队党支书。当那枚借钱刻的公章抓在他和他的6位平均年龄不足30岁的支委杨金庆、杨水泉、杨冬莲、杨荣庭、杨衍宣、杨荣覃手上的时候，一份别出心裁的改革方案就出台了：用部分扶贫款办小企业，在企业里安排扶贫对象的劳动力。可是他的“改革”引来一顿臭骂。讲究眼前实惠、过惯了平均主义生活的村民们不看扶贫资金使用效益如何，一致要求他将扶贫款均衡地向全村人撒胡椒面。
    “他妈的，老子自家发财去！”杨旭星一气之下跑去信用社贷款，买了台“丰收—27”跑起了运输。两个月下来，每月平均利润上千元。不久，又换回辆“东风”，汽车从村中驶出，他故意将喇叭揿得震天价响。沙洲坝人的眼神里终于出现了异样。杨旭星是骄傲的，他敏锐的头脑使他成了瑞金县第一个运输专业户。
    然而，外界奇异的变化，又令他惊异。他驾着“东风”在村里尽可耀武扬威，可是到了外面，却显得那么不灵。他去北京，到一家商店购货，售货员开发票时竟然写不出“沙洲坝”三字。他告诉她小学二年级课本中就有《吃水不忘挖井人》这一课，写有毛主席在沙洲坝挖井的故事。售货女郎回答说：“我只读过《坐井观天》。”于是，杨旭星希望女郎知道红色故都瑞金，女郎说她只知道首都北京。至于他解释自己那块地方是著名的老区，她更是大摇着头，说她只知道中国有个出了名的深圳特区。
    杨旭星感到一种从未有过的屈辱。不管他是自尊心受到挫伤或是党支部带头人的身份使他猛醒，反正杨旭星在开了一个月“东风”后就下了车。现在回过头来想想，很难说这女郎是故意气他。但红井和红都已在当代人心目中失去了位置却是肯定的！君不见，与延安这两个字眼共同进入人们脑里的，是土窑洞和黄土地；与瑞金这两个字眼一起进入人们脑里的，是土坯房和红壤土。何其相似乃尔！然而，历史偏偏选择了这两个贫穷的地方做了革命圣地，做了共和国摇篮！可是到了今天，摇篮与圣地除了革命的遗址和贫穷可供人参观之外，还能拿出什么去炫耀呢？！
    骄傲的沙洲坝党支部书记心灵受到巨大的震撼，他的荣耀感一刹那间荡然无存。他忽然明白，他是沙洲坝的儿子，他个人的命运是同生他养他的沙洲坝紧紧捆在一起的，仅仅自己成了万元户富了起来，顶多是个孜孜以利的商人而已。他发觉自己确实成了“坐井观天”的蛤蟆。共产党人的责任感、使命感使他意识到：应该跳出“井”的束缚，走向更为广阔的世界。
    一个月光如水的春夜，村里74名共产党员齐聚到了村委会那间低矮的“干打垒”会议室。杨旭星痛心疾首地既正告自己也正告揉着惺忪睡眼的同志们：
    看看外面的世界吧，时代的列车早已远离我们而去，我们这些革命战争年代的“宠儿”，已沦落成了商品经济的“弃婴”。当年我们这地方英雄辈出，难道现在我们都成了无名鼠辈？当年我们的父辈敢于拎着脑袋干革命，难道到了我们这一辈连“乌纱帽”也不敢捏在手里奔富路？！我的好兄弟，再不从麻木中醒来，就会在麻木中灭亡！
    一番针砭入骨的话，使与会的党员们犹如喝下碗壮身酒，瘫软的脊梁挺了起来。历史的回声回荡在他们的心中。他们想站起来，他们会站起来，站在历史与未来的交接点上，用新的时代精神撞响沉默已久的铁钟。
    烧吧，奋斗之火
    30年代初期，这一方血色的土地反了五次军事“围剿”，如今，沙洲坝党支部又要组织一次异乎寻常的反“围剿”——率领村民们冲出贫困的包围圈。
    1985年初，杨旭星毅然停下了日夜奔跑的新“东风”，与村支委的六个伙伴重新搅在一起。杨旭星精明的本能告诉他，他们脚下踏着的浸透先烈鲜血的红土地，并不只会产生贫穷，也能产生财富。它需要一个阿里巴巴神杖来敲开埋藏宝贝的大门。
    经过调查分析，他们很快就写出了办一个中型建材厂的可行性报告。他们十分清楚，办厂要比领扶贫救济物资然后吵吵闹闹分下去还要困难，因为根据拟定的可行性报告，预算金额达40万元，对贫穷的沙洲坝人来说，这简直是一个天文数字。
    一分钱也难倒英雄汉，何况数十万。杨旭星只有求助银行贷款。可是贷款要有人担保，他跑了县、乡一些企业，结果谁也不愿替靠吃国家救济的沙洲坝人担风险。
    “不靠神仙皇帝，全靠我们自己。”这首唤起无数先驱者的战歌同样唤起了杨旭星，他破釜沉舟派出了支委杨金庆、杨水泉北上山海关去订制砖设备。几天后，山海关接二连三拍回催款五万元提货的电报。
    杨旭星捏着五封火烧火燎的电报对村党支部成员说，当年红军在这里给农民许诺，农民踊跃参军参战；解放初期，党和政府兑现了许诺，农民分得了土地、房屋、耕牛，农民拥护党和政府。今天，我们还能给群众什么呢？几十年过去了，群众还是穷！我们都是共产党员，共产党员要有危机感呐！我们这一届支部一定要把村里的穷帽子扔到“爪哇国”。眼下办厂贷款没谁愿意替我们担保，怎么办？活人不能让尿给憋死。我们必须跳出“依赖”这个泥潭，不靠神仙皇帝、全靠自己救自己，用我们党支部成员的家产去银行担保吧！
    杨旭星率先将“东风”汽车抵押进去了，作为组成战斗堡垒的支部其他成员也义无反顾把自己仅有的最贵重的家产——房屋押了上去。破釜沉舟的决心终于换取了银行的信任，五万元贷款很快汇往山海关。
    就像当年的“扩红”一样，所有的人都动员起来了——
    党员干部带头，规定一人至少集资1000元。杨旭星卖掉“东风”车，一人拿出了5000元。刚从山海关风尘仆仆回来的村主任杨金庆翻箱倒柜，也未凑足百元现金。咋办？他左思右想不得法，便打开谷仓挑了200斤稻谷去粜。然而200斤稻谷换来的几十元钱又济什么事？当他再次挑谷出村时，杨旭星眼含热泪制止了他。那是一家数口人的口粮啊？为了口中的吃食，沙洲坝人曾被困扰了几十年，现在再要钱用，也不能挖肉补疮呀！然而杨金庆没有接受杨旭星的照顾，他认为自己这个支委不能例外，他寻亲访友，终于借得一家亲戚筹备建房用的12吨水泥，用来浇灌建材厂基础梁。
    专业户中的共产党员利用自己的“财势”将办公室、避雨棚、煤篷等大项目承包下来。当年由毛主席取过名的沙洲坝老乡长，不辞辛苦，走家串户，动员老红军集资。杨世梁等30多位老红军看到年轻党员们的干劲，深深感动了，自愿从每月的工资中扣出50元作投资。敬老院的烈士遗孀和红属们则来了一场“超前”行动，她们将积攒下来的政府补助款倾囊而出，预交电费，竟然交到2000年。
    为了广开集资财路，党支部规定进厂的每个工人带资300元。接着，向专业户借得7万元。支委们带领村民用4个小土窑烧制了办厂急需的120万块砖，又节约了近8万元。
    沙洲坝人为了追求美好的明天，再次伴着历史的钟声，唱出一曲改革的新歌。
    机器终于安然运回了沙洲坝。
    可是，没有吊车，庞大的搅拌机、对滚机、挤出机要从车上卸下来谈何容易！然而，困难吓不倒沙洲坝人。沙洲坝人虽然缺钱，力气却有的是。
    “吭唷！吭唷！”力拔山兮气盖世！沙洲坝人凭着一副铁肩膀干起来了。他们头顶青天，脚踩红土，挺起了脊梁。
    厂房建起来了，村里有史以来的54米高的第一个工业烟囱竖起来了。沙洲坝人的热情鼓起来了。
    1986年元月4日，新建的建材厂循环窑要点火了。仿佛节日一般，敲锣打鼓，那串高高挑起的鞭炮热情奔放地炸响了。全村人聚集于窑前，异常激动地看着县长为点火剪彩。
    窑火烧起来了，火光熊熊。
    吃了三个月开水泡饭、日夜不离建材厂建筑工地的杨旭星和其他支委们，一个个兴高采烈。然而，当人们沉醉在胜利的喜悦之中时，窑火却无情地熄灭了。宛如晴天里打下一个霹雳，人们的欢笑化成了额头上的颗颗冷汗。杨旭星心凉了半截，木立于窑前，像被霜打蔫的小草。他的自信和欢快被失望荡尽。
    第二次忐忑不安地点火时，全场静得像退了潮的海，种种复杂的心情交织一块，令人心焦。
    好像命运之神不愿轻易地把成功之果馈赠给这群贫困饥饿却又倔犟地希望改变命运的人们，这一次点火又失败了。卸出几乎不成型的砖坯一看，窑上砌的顶砖已被憋在窑里无法排除的水蒸汽蚀得千疮百孔。这回，20万砖坯报废了。
    男儿有泪不轻弹，只因未到伤心处。那20万砖坯，烧制出来就是1.6万元钱呵！那几个月来的辛勤汗水，集拢来足够冲刷贫困！那近20万元集资，更是全村党员、群众乃至老红军、老红属们勒紧肚皮抠出来的希望！现在希望之火熄灭了，群众还会相信我们吗？党支部的威信还能树起来吗？……想到这些，支委里的七个伙伴在窑孔里抱头痛哭。哭吧，哭个痛快。也许只有哭才是最好的宣泄呵？
    杨旭星哭了，又猛然擦去眼角的泪水，“腾腾腾”走到毛主席故居前吊着铁钟的古樟下，发狂似的“当当当”敲响了那口战争年代报警的铁钟。犹如暗夜中升起串串信号弹，雄浑的钟声召齐了沙洲坝人，他们信任杨旭星，信任党支部。当杨旭星流泪告诉父老乡亲们第二次点火又熄灭了，失败原因可能是窑太湿，问他们该怎么办时，村民们异口同声地大喊：“烧火烘干吧！”于是，大家又呼啦一下从家里挑来了一捆捆稻草，塞进窑孔，烧火烘窑。
    多好的群众啊，沙洲坝人身上，无疑流的是先烈们的血，红军战士的血。
    当重新填进20万块砖坯，点燃起第三把火时，那经历了挫折磨难的火光纵情地突奔，升腾，扩展，终于烧起了希望之火，成功之火！
    从历史走向未来
    沙洲坝村建材厂从开工到1988年底，3年下来，不仅所借债务全部还清，去年还交税6万元，全厂166名工人，人平均年工资800元。800元，对于沙洲坝人来说，则实在是一个了不起的大数字。须知直到1980年，这里的年人均纯收入还只有78元，而在1980年以前，沙洲坝760户，3600多人每人得到的救济粮（物）人均每年就有50元，相当于他们自己一年生产的纯收入。800元，无疑是个了不起的飞跃，它使沙洲坝人产生了一个精神上的飞跃。
    沙洲坝村几年工夫，自力更生办起了建材厂、轧钢厂、农药厂、果茶场、采石场、采沙场、农电站、电灌站……全村1100个劳动力中已有726个成了工人，其中，70％原是“双扶”对象。
    几年的艰苦创业，开始有了累累硕果，沙洲坝村去年工业产值达到一百八十万元。村里已有汽车六辆，拖拉机、小四轮三十多辆，一家个体珠绣加工厂生产的产品已走向海外。村里八千五百亩荒山已开始变绿，五百亩柑桔果压枝头，在生产承包责任制后修筑的蜈蚣坑、嶂义坑两座水库和大布桥电灌站，改变了“三天不下雨，无水洗手帕”的恶劣的自然条件，沙洲坝人彻底告别了一进入胃肠就泛酸水的蕃薯渣。1988年全村人均纯收入达到五百零九元，相当于十年前的十倍。
    沙洲坝人戴了无数辈的贫困帽子，在这辈人手中终于扔进了“爪哇国”。共和国摇篮里的人在党支部的率领下展开双翼，开始向着富裕奋飞。
    物质的变化带来了精神面貌的改观。沙洲坝人也是精神的真正富有者。他们从众多的报刊里获取更多的致富信息和科学知识。他们从电视机的荧光屏里洞察沙洲坝以外更为广阔的世界。他们充分认识到文化对改造人素质的作用，村委会每年拨给村里那所“列宁小学”的投资都是一笔可观的数目。现在，这所小学成了全县农村教学设备最好的学校。村里适龄儿童入学率达到百分之九十八。
    沙洲坝人进入了生活的万花筒。尽管他们没有沿海人的气派，也没有特区的风光。然而，生活在共和国摇篮里的沙洲坝人毕竟在走向富裕，在追赶希望。
    走过红井，走过中华苏维埃共和国临时中央政府遗址，走过叶坪那座子弹型烈士纪念塔，走过红军广场那镶嵌着“踏着先烈的血迹前进！”醒目大字的鹅卵石路面。
    杨旭星在建国四十周年大庆之时，带着全村人的嘱托，从昨日的红都走进今日的首都，光荣地出席了全国先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者表彰大会。
    当然，他不再像十年前的沙洲坝人那样，千里迢迢来到北京向共和国的元勋们索取“许诺”，他要告诉人们躺下索取“许诺”的历史宣告结束，站起来自强奋进的篇章重新掀开，共和国摇篮里的人没有给共和国抹黑，他们挺直脊梁后还是伟岸的巨人！
