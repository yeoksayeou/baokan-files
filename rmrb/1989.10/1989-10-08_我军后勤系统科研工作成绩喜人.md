The scientific research and teaching staff of the PLA's logistics system have worked diligently to serve the modernization of the military's logistics, achieving commendable results.

Over the past decade, they have published more than 120 monographs and translations on logistics theory, compiled or revised over 200 textbooks, and published more than 1,500 academic papers in military and civilian journals. Among these, more than 30 books and papers have won awards in national or military-wide competitions.

Currently, the PLA's logistics system has established a multi-level, multi-disciplinary research framework led by the National Defense University and the Logistics Academy, with more than ten military logistics professional and technical institutions as the backbone, and the logistics command, management, and support departments of the General Logistics Department and various major military units as the base. This integrated system of teaching and research has effectively adapted to the strategic shift in military construction guidance and the urgent need for logistics reform. It has enriched the PLA's logistics theoretical library and promoted the development of academic textbooks towards specialization and serialization. The abundant logistics research achievements of the PLA have provided theoretical guidance for the integrated operations training of the army, the long-distance navigation of the navy, the long-range operations training of the air force, and the logistics support of the troops in emergency situations, thus having a profound impact on the modernization and regularization of the PLA.

    我军后勤系统科研工作成绩喜人
    本报讯　我军后勤系统的科研教学人员刻苦攻关，为部队后勤现代化建设服务，取得了可喜的成绩。
    近10年来，共出版后勤理论专著译著120余部，新编改编教材200余本，在军内外刊物上发表学术论文1500余篇，其中30余本（篇）书籍和论文在全国或全军评比中获奖。
    目前，我军后勤系统已经形成了以国防大学、后勤学院为龙头，以全军十余所后勤专业技术院校为骨干，以总后机关和全军各大单位的后勤指挥、管理及保障部门为基点的上下结合、教研结合的多层次、多学科的研究体系。后勤科研工作的深入开展，较好地适应了军队建设指导思想的战略转变与后勤改革的迫切需要。丰富了我军的后勤理论文库，促进了院校教材向学科化、系列化发展。我军丰硕的后勤科研成果，对陆军合成军作战训练、海军航行远海大洋、空军远程作战训练以及部队在应急情况下的后勤保障，给予了理论指导，从而对我军的现代化、正规化建设产生了深远的影响。
