Two farmers from the suburbs of Yánchéng City in Jiangsu Province wrote to our newspaper, reporting rumors that the Household Contract Responsibility System might be abolished and hoping the editorial department would provide an answer. We appreciate the trust these two comrades have placed in us. At the same time, we solemnly inform our broad masses of farmers that the Party's policies in rural areas, including the Household Contract Responsibility System, which have proven effective and correct, will not change. Instead, they will be further developed and improved through deepening reforms.

In his speech on National Day, Jiang Zemin pointed out: "We must continue to deepen rural reforms, implement stable rural policies, improve various forms of the Household Contract Responsibility System, and establish and improve the service systems for pre-production, in-production, and post-production. At the same time, in regions with suitable conditions, we must, based on the principle of voluntary participation by farmers, steadily promote moderate-scale management." This clearly tells us that current rural policies will be stable. In most regions across the country, the current task is to adhere to and improve various forms of the Household Contract Responsibility System. In a few economically developed regions with higher mechanization levels and faster development of township enterprises, as well as in some suburbs of large and medium-sized cities, moderate-scale management can be implemented in a planned manner. However, implementing moderate-scale management requires two conditions: first, it must be feasible based on objective conditions; second, it must be voluntary for the farmers, and it cannot be forced. Currently, most regions in China do not meet these two conditions. Most regions still need to adhere to and improve the existing household-based contract system. Even in places where moderate-scale management is implemented, various forms of contract management should be adopted to organically combine the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers with the advantages of collective economy, and we must not return to the era of "eating from the same big pot."

The Household Contract Responsibility System needs to be further adhered to and improved because it not only suits the current level of productivity development in most rural areas of China; it is also a relatively good form of organizing farmers to produce grain, cotton, oil crops, and various types of livestock under current conditions. Moreover, it is a component of the socialist agricultural development path with Chinese characteristics, created by farmers based on the summary of both positive and negative experiences over many years. The practice of ten years of reform has indisputably proven that it can fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of farmers, promoting the rapid development of rural productivity. Over the past ten years, China's per capita grain possession has increased from 300 kilograms to over 400 kilograms; cotton production has increased from over 2 million tons to over 4 million tons; per capita possession of animal-based food has increased from 20 kilograms to 40 kilograms. None of this would have been possible without household-based contract management. Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. Since practice has proven that the Household Contract Responsibility System is successful and effective, why should we change it?

Of course, with the development of productivity and the changes in the objective situation in rural areas, this effective form of management must be continuously improved and elevated, or supplemented and modified according to actual needs, to better meet the wishes of farmers and the requirements of productivity, and to suit the reality of the primary stage of socialism. However, all these must be based on the voluntary participation of the masses. We will never repeat the foolish act of going against the will of the farmers and hindering the development of rural productivity. Some people say, "They are about to start the 'big commune' again," which is a rumor. If some places indeed want to do this, it must be immediately corrected.

The letter also makes us realize the importance of ideological and political work in rural areas. Currently, cadres at all levels in rural areas must seriously study Jiang Zemin's National Day speech and promptly conduct propaganda and education among farmers to dispel various concerns, so that the broad masses of farmers can actively engage in production and advance rural work along the path indicated by the Party Central Committee!

　　农村联产承包责任制坚持不变
　　本报评论员
    江苏盐城市郊区两位农民给本报来信，反映当地风传联产承包制要取消的事，希望编辑部予以答复。我们感谢这两位同志对我们的信任，同时我们负责地告诉广大农民同志，党在农村包括联产承包责任制在内的各项行之有效的正确政策是不会变的，相反，还要在深化改革中进一步发展和完善。
    江泽民同志在国庆讲话这一纲领性文件中指出：“要继续深化农村改革，执行稳定的农村政策，完善多种形式的联产承包责任制，建立和健全产前、产中、产后服务体系。同时，在有条件的地区，要根据农民自愿的原则，稳妥地推进适度规模经营。”这就清楚地告诉我们，农村的现行政策是要稳定的。在全国，就大部分地区来说，当前还是要坚持和完善多种形式的联产承包责任制。少数经济发达、机械化程度较高和乡村工业发展较快较好的地区，以及部分大中城市郊区，可以有计划地实行适度规模经营。但是，实行适度规模经营，一要根据客观条件，确实可能；二要根据农民群众自愿，不能强制。从目前情况看，我国农村大部分地区还不具备这两条。大部分地区还是要坚持和完善现行的以家庭联产承包为主要形式的承包制。即使搞了适度规模经营的地方，也要采取各种形式的承包经营，把广大农民的积极性和集体经济的优越性有机地结合起来，绝不能再吃“大锅饭”。
    农村联产承包责任制之所以需要进一步坚持和完善，因为它不仅符合目前我国大部分农村生产力发展的水平；是目前条件下组织农民进行粮食、棉花、油料等各类种植业和各类养殖业生产的较好形式；同时，也因为它是我们在总结多年正反两方面经验的基础上，由农民创造的有中国特色的社会主义农业发展道路的组成部分。10年改革的实践向我们无可辩驳地证明，它能充分调动亿万农民的生产积极性，推动农村社会生产力迅速发展。10年来，我国人均占有粮食由300公斤提高到400多公斤；棉花总产由200多万吨提高到400多万吨；人均占有的动物性食品由20公斤上升到40公斤。这一切，如果不是家庭联产承包经营，是不可能做到的。实践是检验真理的唯一标准。既然实践证明联产承包责任制是成功的、有效的，为什么要改变它呢？
    当然，随着生产力的发展，随着农村客观形势的变化，各类联产承包责任制这一有效的经营形式也要不断地完善和提高，或者根据实际需要进行补充和修改，使之更符合农民的愿望和生产力的要求，符合社会主义初级阶段的实际，但是这些都要出于群众的自愿。我们绝不会再做违背农民意愿、妨碍农村生产力发展的蠢事。有人说“马上要搞‘大呼隆’了”，这是谣传，如果个别地方确实想这样干，要立即纠正。
    来信也使我们看到农村思想政治工作的重要。在当前，农村各级党委和政府的同志，要认真学习江泽民同志的国庆讲话，并且及时向农民进行宣传教育，消除各种顾虑，使广大农民积极投入到生产中去，使农村的各项工作沿着党中央指引的道路胜利前进！
