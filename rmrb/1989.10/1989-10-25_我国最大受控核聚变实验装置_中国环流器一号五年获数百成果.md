Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 24th - (Correspondent Quan Nengsen) China's largest controlled nuclear fusion experimental device, the Chinese Tokamak-1, has been safely operating for five years. In the exploration of conditions for achieving controlled nuclear fusion, significant progress has been made, contributing greatly to humanity's search for the most ideal energy source.

Since the Chinese Tokamak-1 began its experimental operation, the Southwest Institute of Physics of the China Nuclear Industry has conducted sixteen major joint experiments on this device, achieving 349 experimental research results, with 52 of them winning awards. The experiments have obtained high parameters and indicators, such as a magnetic field strength of 34,000 gauss, plasma current of 220,000 amperes, electron temperature of 18 million degrees, plasma density of 70 trillion to 90 trillion particles per cubic centimeter, plasma duration of 1,600 milliseconds, and energy confinement time greater than 25 milliseconds. These parameters and indicators are at the forefront domestically and rank among the top 18 in the world for similar-scale devices. The duration of the plasma is particularly notable, being rare among similar-scale devices internationally. The Chinese Tokamak-1 device was designed, manufactured, and debugged independently by China. It was successfully launched and put into experimental operation in September 1984. In 1987, it won the National Science and Technology Progress First Prize. The achievements it has made in experimental research for domestic and international projects have been highly praised by international experts in the field. Among these, it has successfully undertaken two important research projects from the International Atomic Energy Agency, achieving satisfactory results.

Controlled nuclear fusion is a major scientific and technological challenge of our time. Its goal is to replicate the principle by which the sun and other stars release energy, causing light elements such as deuterium and tritium to undergo fusion reactions under super-high temperature and other specific conditions, thereby releasing enormous energy. The Chinese Tokamak-1 is an experimental device for this major research topic.

　　我国最大受控核聚变实验装置
　　中国环流器一号五年获数百成果
    据新华社成都十月二十四日电　（通讯员全能森）我国最大的受控核聚变实验装置——中国环流器一号安全运行实验五周年，在探索实现受控核聚变的条件方面，取得了可喜进展，为人类寻求最理想的能源作出了重大贡献。
    中国环流器一号投入运行实验以来，中国核工业西南物理研究院在这套装置上，先后进行了十六次大型联合实验，取得了三百四十九项实验研究成果，获奖成果达五十二项。实验中获得了较高的实验参数和指标，如磁场强度达三点四万高斯，等离子体电流达二百二十千安，电子温度达一千八百万度，等离子体密度达每立方厘米七十万亿个至九十万亿个，等离子体持续时间达一千六百毫秒，能量约束时间大于二十五毫秒，等等。这些参数和指标居国内最前列，进入国际上同规模装置的前十八名，其中等离子体持续时间之长，为国际上同规模装置所罕见。中国环流器一号装置是我国自行设计制造和安装调试的，一九八四年九月顺利启动，投入运行实验。一九八七年荣获国家科技进步一等奖。它在为国内外承担的实验研究中取得的成就，受到国际上同行专家的好评。其中承担国际原子能机构的两个重要研究项目，也取得满意的成果。
    受控核聚变是当今世界科学技术的一个重大课题。它的任务是根据太阳和其它恒星释放能量的原理，通过氘、氚等轻元素的原子核在超高温等特定条件下发生聚变反应，从而释放出巨大能量。中国环流器一号是这一重大研究课题的实验装置。
