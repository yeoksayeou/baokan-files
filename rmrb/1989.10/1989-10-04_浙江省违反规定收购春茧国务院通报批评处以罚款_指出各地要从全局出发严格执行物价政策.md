Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 26th.

The General Office of the State Council issued a circular on September 26th regarding the handling of Zhejiang Province's violation of state regulations on the procurement of spring silk cocoons.

The circular stated that to address the issue of silk cocoon procurement prices in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces this year and to prevent a "silk cocoon war," the State Council convened a coordination meeting in Beijing on May 5th with relevant officials from both provinces. On May 23rd, the General Office of the State Council issued a notice stipulating: "If Zhejiang Province implements a price rebate for farmers under the agricultural-industrial-commercial integrated management system, it must not announce the specific rebate amount to farmers during the silk cocoon procurement process, nor should it implement the rebate immediately after procurement. It must wait until the end of the year, after the entire silk cocoon procurement is completed, to report the specific rebate amount and quantity to the State Price Bureau and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation for review and approval before implementation. For important agricultural products such as silk cocoons, it is absolutely not allowed to act independently, let alone adopt a method of acting first and reporting later to violate state regulations."

However, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government disregarded the State Council's regulations and, on June 21st, issued a notice in the name of the Provincial Silk and Textile Management Leading Group to various silk cocoon-producing cities and counties, stating: "For the evaluation of silk cocoons, 20% of the silk cocoon price will be returned for those evaluated by instruments, and 15% for those evaluated by the naked eye. The rebate will be completed between June 21st and July 10th."

The circular from the General Office of the State Council pointed out that the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government's decision to advance the silk cocoon rebate without the approval of the State Price Bureau and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and without reporting to the State Council, violated the State Council's regulations on silk cocoon procurement rebates. This action had an adverse impact on the silk cocoon procurement in neighboring provinces. Such behavior, which disregards orders, fails to stop prohibited actions, acts independently, and does not consider the overall situation, seriously violates organizational discipline and is wrong. To uphold political discipline and maintain the state's price policy, the State Council decided to issue a circular criticizing the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government and impose a fine on it, which will be remitted to the central treasury. The responsible officials of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government should learn from this, conduct a thorough self-examination, correct their mistakes, and ensure the smooth operation of future silk cocoon procurement work.

The General Office of the State Council pointed out that the prices of silk cocoons and other important commodities are related to the overall national economy. All regions must consider the overall situation and strictly implement the state's price policy without taking independent actions. The procurement of summer and autumn silk cocoons this year should still be carried out according to the prices stipulated by the State Price Bureau and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and no arbitrary price increases or disguised price increases are allowed. The "silk cocoon war" must be resolutely stopped. If problems arise, the responsible parties and leaders must be held accountable.

    浙江省违反规定收购春茧国务院通报批评处以罚款
    指出各地要从全局出发严格执行物价政策
    新华社北京电　国务院办公厅9月26日就处理浙江省违反国家规定收购春茧问题发出通报。
    通报说，为解决浙江、江苏省今年蚕茧收购价格问题，防止“蚕茧大战”，国务院于5月5日召集两省的有关负责同志来京开了协调会议，5月23日国务院办公厅又发出通知，规定：“浙江省如果对茧农实行农工贸联营价外返利，在收购蚕茧时不得向农民宣布具体返利金额，也不得在蚕茧收购后即行返利，必须待年终蚕茧收购全部结束，经结算将具体返利金额和数量上报国家物价局和经贸部研究审定后再执行。对于蚕茧等重要农产品，绝不能各行其是，更不准采取先斩后奏的办法违反国家规定。”但是，浙江省人民政府无视国务院的规定，于6月21日，以省政府茧丝绸管理领导小组的名义，向各蚕茧产区市、县人民政府下发了《关于春蚕返利有关问题的通知》，规定：仪评的按茧款的20％，目评的按茧款的15％，在6月21日至7月10日完成返利。
    国务院办公厅的通报指出，浙江省人民政府决定蚕茧返利提前兑现，事先未经国家物价局、经贸部同意，也未报国务院批准，违反了国务院有关收购蚕茧返利的规定，给毗邻省的蚕茧收购造成了不利影响。这种有令不行、有禁不止、自行其是、不顾大局的做法，严重违反了组织纪律，是错误的。为严肃政纪，维护国家物价政策，国务院决定对浙江省人民政府予以通报批评，并在经济上处以罚款，上缴中央财政。浙江省人民政府负责人应从中吸取教训，作出深刻检查，改正错误，把今后的蚕茧收购工作抓好。
    国务院办公厅指出，蚕茧和其他重要商品价格，事关国民经济大局，各地都要从全局出发，严格执行国家的物价政策，不得擅自行动。今年夏、秋茧收购，仍按国家物价局和经贸部规定的价格执行，不得任意加价或变相加价。要坚决制止“蚕茧大战”，如出现问题，要严肃追究当事人和领导者的责任。
