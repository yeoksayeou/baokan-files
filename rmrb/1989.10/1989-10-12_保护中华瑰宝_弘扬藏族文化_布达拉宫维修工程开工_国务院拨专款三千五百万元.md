The Potala Palace in Lhasa, which has been neglected for many years, has developed multiple hazards and serious risks. To protect this treasure of Chinese national culture and to promote the great history and culture of the Tibetan people and the motherland, the State Council has allocated a special fund of 35 million yuan for the key restoration of the Potala Palace. On October 6, the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region issued a notice to this effect. According to Tibetan traditional calculations and divination, today, October 11, at 1:30 PM, is an auspicious time for the commencement of the work.

The Potala Palace, constructed from earth, wood, and stone, was initially built in the 7th century. The current scale of the palace dates back to its reconstruction in the 17th century. The main building is 13 stories high and 119 meters tall, making it the highest building in the world. It is a magnificent structure that combines the architectural styles of palaces, fortresses, temples, and both Tibetan and Han buildings. The Potala Palace holds an unparalleled historical, religious, and cultural status in Tibet. This restoration is the first comprehensive renovation of the Potala Palace in 340 years.

To ensure the successful completion of this grand classical building restoration project, a leading group for the restoration of the Potala Palace has been established, with a State Council leader as the honorary chairman and leaders from the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the State Administration of Cultural Heritage participating. Under this group, there is the Tibet Autonomous Region Restoration Project Coordination Leading Group and the Construction Office.

The construction workforce will be organized by the Tibet Autonomous Region, while the technical guidance and construction quality will be jointly managed by experts from the State Administration of Cultural Heritage and Tibetan ancient building technicians.

The principles of the restoration work are: meticulous design, fine construction, strong leadership, and absolute safety. At the same time, in accordance with the Cultural Relics Protection Law's stipulation of "not altering the original state of cultural relics," the restoration will focus on repairing and restoring the original structure and overall appearance of the Potala Palace.

The restoration of the Potala Palace is a project of global significance. During the construction period, the Potala Palace will remain open to visitors, pilgrims, and tourists.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Pabala Gelegdainqie, and over 200 officials, experts, and workers from the autonomous region attended the commencement ceremony.

    保护中华瑰宝　弘扬藏族文化
    布达拉宫维修工程开工
    国务院拨专款三千五百万元
    本报拉萨10月11日电　记者刘伟报道：坐落在拉萨的布达拉宫年久失修，已出现多处险情，隐患严重。为保护中华民族文化瑰宝，弘扬伟大祖国和藏族人民的历史文化，国务院拨出专款3500万元，对布达拉宫进行重点维修。10月6日，西藏自治区人民政府为此发出公告。经藏族传统历算和占卦，选择今天13点30分为开工良辰吉日。
    土、木、石结构的布达拉宫，初建于公元7世纪，现在的规模为17世纪重建。主建筑高13层、119米，为世界上海拔最高，集宫殿、城堡、寺院藏汉建筑风格于一体的宏伟建筑。布达拉宫在西藏有着至高无上的历史、宗教、文化地位。这次为布达拉宫340年来首次较全面的维修。
    为保证圆满完成这一宏大古典建筑的维修任务，成立了由国务院领导同志为名誉组长，西藏自治区人民政府、国家文物局等部门领导人员参加的维修布达拉宫领导小组，下设西藏自治区维修工程协调领导小组和施工办公室。
    维修工程的施工力量由西藏自治区组织；技术指导和施工质量由国家文物局专家与西藏古建技术人员共同负责。
    维修工作的原则是：精心设计，精细施工，加强领导，万无一失。同时按照文物保护法关于“不改变文物原状”的规定，整旧复原，保持布达拉宫的原有结构和整体风貌。
    维修布达拉宫的工程举世瞩目。施工期间，对前往布达拉宫朝佛、旅游、参观者继续开放。
    全国政协副主席帕巴拉·格列朗杰和自治区的党政官员、专家、职工等200多人参加了开工典礼。
