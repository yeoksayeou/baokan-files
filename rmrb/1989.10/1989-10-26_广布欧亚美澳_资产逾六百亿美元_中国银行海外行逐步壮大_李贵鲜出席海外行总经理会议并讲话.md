China Bank President Wang Deyue revealed at the opening of the overseas branch managers' meeting today: China Bank has established institutions in the major financial centers of 12 countries and regions, initially forming a comprehensive development layout across Europe, Asia, America, and Australia.

By the end of 1988, China Bank's overseas branches had reached 304, an increase of 53 compared to 1986; the number of employees exceeded 13,000, a growth of 24% compared to 1986. By the end of May this year, the total assets of overseas branches had reached $66.5 billion, with a deposit balance of $27.8 billion, both growing by 150% and 89% respectively compared to 1986. The loan balance reached $13.9 billion, more than doubling compared to 1986. They leveraged the overall advantages of China Bank, using various financing methods to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign exchange funds to the domestic market, strongly supporting national economic construction, and effectively achieving the goal of "standing overseas, serving modernization."

In June this year, China Bank's overseas branches, especially those in Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore, faced unprecedented severe withdrawal pressures. The headquarters and various overseas branches took timely and decisive measures to maintain the country's dignity and China Bank's international reputation.

Over the past two years, while developing traditional businesses, the overseas branches have actively explored new businesses, enhancing their competitiveness. There have been significant improvements in management, with a focus on market research and business planning, emphasizing the installation and utilization of computer facilities. Various economic performance indicators, including profit levels, have seen substantial improvements compared to two years ago.

State Councilor and Governor of the People's Bank of China, Li Guixian, attended today's overseas branch managers' meeting and delivered a speech. He discussed the current economic and financial situation, fully affirmed the work of the overseas branches, and, on behalf of the State Council, extended cordial greetings to the overseas branch staff.

    截至1988年底，中国银行海外分支机构已达304个，比1986年增加了53个；职工人数已超过1.3万人，比1986年增长24％。至今年5月底，海外行资产总值已达665亿美元，存款余额达278亿美元，分别比1986年增长150％和89％。放款余额达139亿美元，比1986年增长1倍多。他们发挥中国银行整体优势，通过各种融资方式，向国内提供外汇资金上百亿美元，有力地支持了国家经济建设，很好地实现了“立足海外，服务四化”的宗旨。
    今年6月，中国银行各海外行特别是港澳中银集团各行和新加坡等分行，经受了从未有过的严重挤提的考验。总行及各海外行及时果断地采取了一系列强有力的应变措施，维护了国家的尊严和中国银行的对外信誉。
    两年来，各海外行在发展传统业务的同时，积极开拓新业务，增强了竞争能力；经营管理有较大改进，重视市场调研和经营规划，注重电脑设施的装备和利用，利润水平等各项经济效益指标都较两年前有了很大提高。

    李贵鲜指出，今明两年，为了保证国民经济稳定发展和对外债务的如期偿还，必须在总体上对外汇资金做好综合平衡。李贵鲜强调，中国银行作为国家外汇外贸专业银行，对做好外汇资金的综合平衡负有重要责任。为此，各海外银行要千方百计壮大资金实力，多吸收存款，尽可能用较低的成本筹集较多的长期外汇资金，支持国家建设和对外经济进一步发展。
    李贵鲜特别要求，在港澳的中银集团和保险公司要继续充分利用一切有利条件，积极发展集团实力，广泛团结当地金融界、工商界人士，努力维护港澳地区的经济繁荣和香港在国际金融的中心地位。
