Photography's contribution to human modern civilization
—Written on the Occasion of the First China Photography Art Festival

Photography has nurtured and produced modern civilization, and in turn, has promoted the development of modern civilization. The significance of photography lies in its realization of the long-standing human dream of capturing and recording meaningful, fleeting moments in life, transforming them into historical treasures with aesthetic, documentary, or research value, preserving them permanently.

Photography, once a magical art that shocked the world, has been born for 150 years. At the first China Photography Art Festival held in our country, while celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we also commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of photography, which has special significance.

Over the past 40 years since the founding of the nation, China's socialist photography industry has followed the Party's literary and artistic guidelines. It has reflected the great achievements of socialist construction, the forward-marching footsteps of the People's Republic, and has made valuable contributions to the development of material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization.

In the 150 years since the birth of photography, it is only a brief moment in the long river of human history. Yet, in this short historical moment, photography has developed rapidly from its birth, growth, to gradual perfection and maturity, with remarkable achievements. Of course, the value and contributions of photography are not only reflected in the field of art but are embodied in the entire cultural system. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the continuous innovation of modern photography industry, and the increasingly perfect photography technology and equipment, photography has broken free from many technical constraints, allowing photographers to freely capture any fast-moving objects and freely capture various scenes in the universe from the micro to the macro. Moreover, photography is a visual, intuitive, and easy-to-understand global language for the masses. It can transcend time and space, overcome geographical, ethnic, and cultural limitations, and quickly and widely disseminate modern information. Today, photography has been divided into many categories. It can be said that in politics, economy, culture, education, science, military, as well as in art and news including film and television, photography is involved and has made contributions. Therefore, we must stand at the higher level and perspective of "culture" to examine the multi-faceted role and contributions of photography.

The significance of the birth of photography also lies in its introduction of science and technology into the field of art for the first time, making science and art intertwine, giving birth to a new and unique art form—photographic art. Of course, due to the strong scientific and technical nature of photography, there have been doubts, denials, and even ridicule about whether it can become an independent art form.

In fact, in the first few decades after the invention of photography in 1839, due to the poor performance of photosensitive materials and optical lenses, photography was subject to various technical constraints. Although some people used the compositional rules and modeling methods of painting, adopting techniques such as staging, cutting, and compositing, to create some "picturesque" photographs, it cannot be denied that they had a certain artistic quality, but this still could not be considered strict art. It was only in the early 1990s of the last century that, with the development of modern technology and the updating of people's concepts, photography truly entered the realm of "art" from "technology," becoming an independent new art form. Due to the characteristics of photography such as realism, instantaneity, and credibility, its social functions and roles are also multifaceted. People can examine and understand it from various angles such as sociology, cultural studies, anthropology, and aesthetics. In fact, it is a multi-dimensional structure, a unity of aesthetic cognition, aesthetic evaluation, and aesthetic expression, a unity of truth, goodness, and beauty.

Therefore, from an overall perspective, it truly contains and plays a multi-faceted social role in enjoying beauty, purifying the soul, enlightening, and inspiring the spirit. From this, we can see the unique contributions of China's photographic art to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

We are proud that in the history of world photography, the Chinese people have also written a glorious chapter. As early as more than 20 centuries before the invention of Daguerre's photography, in the mid-5th century BC, in the "Mo Jing" written by the Mohist school of the pre-Qin period in our country, there were already records of research on the optical principles of photography such as "pin-hole imaging." Later, scholars and practitioners such as Shen Kuo of the Northern Song Dynasty, Zhao Youqin of the Yuan Dynasty, Liu Song of the Ming Dynasty, Yu Yizheng, Fang Yizi, Zheng Fuguang, Zhou Bochi, and Sun Yunqiu of the Qing Dynasty also recorded research results related to optics, lenses, and camera obscura in their works. It was only due to historical and technological limitations that we fell behind the West. Nevertheless, the research achievements of our glorious ancestors have had a necessary influence and promoting effect on the invention and development of photography. Their historical contributions are indelible.

After photography was introduced into China in the 1840s, especially in the 1920s and 1930s of this century, our pioneers made beneficial contributions in promoting and developing our national photography industry, organizing various photography groups, initiating photography creation, reflecting the social life full of class and national contradictions at that time, researching and publishing various aesthetic ideas and photographic art theories, etc. During the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, our older generation of revolutionary photographers insisted on serving the people and the revolutionary war, holding a gun in one hand and a camera in the other, capturing many scenes of the heroic images of our military and civilians and the magnificent and tragic battlefields. These works with artistic and documentary value still have their inspiring and educational role today, adding precious visual materials to China's cultural treasury.

After the founding of New China, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, a large number of photographers and photography workers have inherited and carried forward the fine traditions, adhered to the socialist orientation, insisted on the spirit of realism, and shot a large number of excellent works reflecting the socialist style, praising the heroic deeds of the creators, showing the sublime spiritual realm and moral character of the people, and praising the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland. These works have enriched people's spiritual life and inspired people's national spirit. At the same time, in the new period, a situation of multiple artistic methods and styles coexisting with realism as the main melody has gradually formed. In the field of photographic theory construction, the previous weak situation has also been initially changed, and the exploration and research of establishing a photographic theory with Chinese characteristics have begun. In addition, a group of promising young and middle-aged photographers and photographic theorists have emerged; photographic education, especially higher art education, has initially laid a good foundation; photographic organizations and groups have been established one after another; photographic exhibitions and competitions are frequently held, and photographic books and periodicals are published in large quantities; international photographic exchange activities are frequently carried out, etc., all of which are incomparable to the previous period. In short, in the 40 years since the founding of the nation, significant achievements have been made. However, it is also undeniable that in the entire political and historical background of the past 40 years, the field of photographic art has also been affected by the "Left" trend or bourgeois liberalization, especially during the "Cultural Revolution," the "Gang of Four" controlled, utilized, and destroyed photography, making the photography industry go through a tortuous process. In the future, we must firmly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and adhere to the "two for" direction and the "hundred flowers" policy, which are the fundamental guarantees for the prosperity and development of our socialist photography industry.

China's photography industry is a part of the world's photography industry. The development of China's photography industry and its contributions are also contributions to the world's photography industry. For this, we feel extremely excited and proud. I believe that in the future, as a symbol of human modern civilization, photography will make greater contributions to promoting the development of human modern civilization.

    摄影对人类现代文明的奉献
    ——写在首届中国摄影艺术节
    袁毅平
    人类的现代文明孕育产生了摄影，摄影又反过来推进了现代文明的发展。摄影的重要贡献在于它实现了数千年来人们的幻想，把人类生活中某些有意义的稍纵即逝的瞬间事象固定并纪录下来，成为具有审美价值、文献价值或研究价值的历史财富，永久地留存下去。
    摄影，这个当年曾经震惊世界的幻术，已诞生150年了。在我国首次举办的中国摄影艺术节上，在热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年的同时，来纪念摄影诞生150周年，更有特殊的意义。
    建国40年来，我国的社会主义摄影事业，遵循党的文艺方针，在反映社会主义建设的巨大成就，反映人民共和国奋勇前进的时代脚印，在促进物质文明和社会主义精神文明建设中，作出了它可贵的奉献。
    摄影诞生后的150年，在人类历史的长河中只是一个短暂的瞬间，就在这短短的历史瞬间里，摄影从诞生、成长到逐步完善、成熟，其发展之迅速和成果之显著是相当惊人的。当然，摄影的价值和贡献，不只体现在艺术的领域，而是体现在整个文化系统之中。随着现代科学技术的迅猛发展，现代摄影工业的不断革新，以及摄影技术装备的日益完善，摄影已经摆脱了许多技术条件的限制，使摄影者可以随心所欲地捕捉任何快速的动体，可以自由地摄取宇宙间从微观至宏观的各种景物。而且，摄影又是一种形象、直观、通俗易懂的世界性的大众语言，它可以超越时空，不受地域、民族、文化等等的限制，广泛、迅速地传递现代信息。今天的摄影已经划分为许许多多的门类，可以说，在政治、经济、文化、教育、科学、军事以及包括电影、电视在内的艺术和新闻等领域里，几乎都有摄影的参与及其所作的奉献。因此，我们只有站在“文化”这个更高的层次和角度上来考察，才能对摄影的多重性的作用和贡献作出充分的估价。
    摄影诞生的意义，还在于它第一次将科学技术引进了艺术的领域，使科学与艺术发生了联姻，孕育了一门新颖独特的艺术——摄影艺术。当然，由于摄影具有很强的科学性和技术性，对于它是否能成为一门独立的艺术，是曾经受到不少人的怀疑、否定甚至嘲笑的。
    事实上，当1839年摄影术发明后的头几十年里，由于感光材料和光学镜头的性能甚差，照相要受着种种技术条件的限制，尽管一些人按照绘画的构图法则及其造型手段，采用摆布、剪贴、合成等等的技法，摄制出一些带有“画意”的照片，不能否认它带有一定的艺术性，但这还不能算作严格意义上的艺术。只是到了上世纪的90年代初，由于现代科技的发展和人们观念的更新，摄影才由“技”真正进入了“艺”，成为一门独立的新兴艺术。由于摄影艺术具有纪实性、瞬间性、可信性等特点，因此它的社会功能和作用也是多重性的，人们可以从社会学、文化学、人类学以及审美等等各个角度来考察、理解它。实际上，它是一个多维的结构，是审美认识、审美评价、审美表现的统一体，是真、善、美的统一体。
    因而从整体上看，它实实在在地蕴含并发挥着美感享受、净化心灵、启迪顿悟、激励心志等多方面的社会作用。由此，我们不难看出我国的摄影艺术在社会主义精神文明建设中的独特贡献。
    我们引以自豪的是，在世界摄影史中，中国人也写下了光辉的一页。远在达盖尔摄影术问世之前的20多个世纪，即公元前5世纪的中叶，在我国先秦墨家学派所著的《墨经》里，早有关于“针孔成象”等有关摄影光学原理的研究纪录。此后，如北宋的沈括，元代的赵友钦，明代的刘侗、于奕正，清代的方以智、郑复光、邹伯奇、孙云球等学者和实践家们，也都在他们的著作中记载着有关光学、透镜、暗箱等摄影方面的研究成果。只是由于历史和科技等等条件的局限，结果反而落在了西方的后面。尽管如此，我们光荣的祖先的这些研究成果，对摄影的发明和发展有着必然的影响和促进作用。他们的历史贡献是不可磨灭的。
    摄影术于19世纪40年代传入我国以后，尤其是在本世纪的20—30年代，我们的先驱者们就为普及和发展我们民族的摄影事业，在组建各种摄影团体，发动摄影创作，反映当时充满阶级矛盾和民族矛盾的社会生活，研究和发表各种美学思想和摄影艺术理论等等方面，作出了有益的贡献。到了抗日战争和解放战争期间，我们老一辈革命摄影家，坚持为人民服务，为革命战争服务，一手拿枪，一手拿相机，拍下了许多反映我国军民的革命英雄主义形象及雄伟悲壮的战斗场面的镜头。这些具有艺术和文献价值的作品，现在仍然有着它的鼓舞和教育作用，为我国的文化宝库增添了珍贵的形象史料。
    新中国成立以后，尤其是党的十一届三中全会以来的新时期里，广大摄影家和摄影工作者继承和发扬了优良的传统，坚持社会主义方向，坚持现实主义精神，拍摄了一大批反映社会主义风貌，歌颂创业者们英雄业绩，表现人民群众崇高思想境界和道德风尚，以及赞美祖国锦绣山河的优秀作品，丰富了人们的精神生活和激发着人们的民族精神。同时在新时期以来，逐步形成了以现实主义为主旋律的多种艺术方法和风格流派并存的多样化的格局。在摄影理论建设方面，也已初步改变了过去薄弱的状况，而且对建立具有中国特色的摄影理论开始进行了探索和研究。此外，一批有作为的中青年摄影家和摄影理论家崛起；摄影教育特别是高等艺术教育已初步打下了良好的基础；摄影组织和团体纷纷建立；摄影展览和比赛频频举办，摄影书刊大量出版；以及国际摄影交流活动频繁开展等等，都是以往时期所不能比拟的。总之，建国40年来，取得了十分可喜的成绩。但是也不必讳言，40年来在整个政治历史的大背景下，摄影艺术领域也受到过“左”的思潮或资产阶级自由化的影响，特别是“文革”期间“四人帮”一伙对摄影的控制、利用和破坏，使摄影事业经过一段曲折的历程。今后我们必须旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，坚持“二为”方向和“双百”方针，这是繁荣和发展我们社会主义摄影事业的根本保证。
    中国的摄影事业是世界摄影事业的一部分，中国摄影事业的发展及其作出的贡献，也是对世界摄影事业所作的贡献，为此我们感到无比兴奋和自豪。我相信，在今后的日子里，作为标志着人类现代文明的摄影，必将在推动人类现代文明的发展中，作出更大的奉献。
