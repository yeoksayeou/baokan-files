In April, Japan's cherry blossoms are in full bloom. The crew of "Cherry Blossom Dream," led by Mr. Huang Aoyuan, arrived in Japan. He said, "I deeply understand the struggles of overseas students in their studies and daily lives. I hope to capture the bittersweet experiences of their lives, their hard work and love for their motherland, and create a television art piece to present to the young people of our country. Let them truly understand that studying abroad is not an easy task, and I also hope they will love their own country and strive for improvement."

The characters in "Cherry Blossom Dream"—Chen Jingru, Lin Shan, Zhou Meihui, and Cui Mingyi—are familiar to the audience. Especially Chen Daoming, who played the role of the "Last Emperor," won the "Flying Apsaras Award" for Best Male Lead this year. Sa Renquan, Gao Baobao, and Xu Yang have also starred in multiple films and TV shows.

A 16-person crew for "Cherry Blossom Dream" arrived in a foreign land to film. The first challenge they faced was the language barrier. Director Shen Haofang, who studied in Japan and returned to China, was the only one in the crew who spoke Japanese. The rest were like "mute" people, with only one translator from the Japanese side to assist. To efficiently complete the filming, they created a new language—sign language. The lighting technician, Ge Shuwen, used this unique language to effectively collaborate with his Japanese counterparts, accurately setting up lights and ensuring precise lighting. They could even discuss personal lives and family matters. Some team members used English, Chinese, simple Japanese, and sign language, along with paper and pen, to communicate and solve many problems.

The crew's stay in Japan was only 30 days. According to the usual practice, it is very difficult to complete filming for three episodes of a TV series in such a short time. The crew was in a foreign land, unfamiliar with the environment, struggling with language barriers, and adapting to a new lifestyle. Work and life were as tense as the plot. They would wake up at three or four in the morning, immediately head to the filming location, and return to the hotel in the evening to review the day's footage and plan the next day's work, often until one or two in the morning. This routine lasted for more than twenty days. We stayed in Osaka, Japan, and didn't even have time to explore the city or visit tourist attractions. The crew's work ethic and efficiency were praised by their Japanese colleagues; the consul general in Osaka also commended our crew multiple times.

The original name of the TV series "Cherry Blossom Dream" is "Overseas Students." In Japan, students work part-time while studying. The crew filmed in the universities where the students studied and in the restaurants where they worked. In the Osaka Castle Park, filled with blooming cherry blossoms, the students held a cherry blossom viewing party. The students and the actors sang songs about missing their homeland, hometown, and mothers, with tears in their eyes, expressing deep emotions. During the cherry blossom season, it is customary in Japan for families to go to the park to view the flowers. With so many people, we explained the situation to them, saying that a Chinese film crew was in Japan to shoot a TV series. They willingly gave up the best spots to view the flowers. The young spectators were so orderly, quietly watching the actors' performances, allowing us to successfully complete the filming of this large-scale crowd scene.

Many famous Japanese actors participated in the filming. Yamada Shizuko played the role of a kind and hospitable Japanese grandmother, treating the three Chinese female students as her own daughters, taking care of them with meticulous attention. This friendly affection was not only reflected in the drama but also permeated the real-life interactions. A Japanese friend moved out of their home to let the film crew use it as the students' residence. Wherever we went to film, whether it was at the airport, hospital, school, or restaurant, we were always given the green light and received strong support. In the bustling Osaka Airport, where people from all directions were coming and going, they still made time for us to film the scene of Lin Shan and others arriving in Japan. This was the first time something like this happened in Japan, making us feel the warmth of Sino-Japanese friendship at every turn.

Huang Aoyuan is the planner of this TV series. The plot, scriptwriting, crew formation, and funding all involved his hard work. He took on three roles: scriptwriter, director, and actor. In the series, he plays the eldest son of a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman who falls in love with and marries a female student who tutors him in Chinese. His character and the TV series he directed both reflect his personality—bold yet delicate, dashing yet steady. These impressions will be conveyed to the television audience along with the broadcast of "Cherry Blossom Dream."

    电视剧《樱花梦》拍摄散记
    贡吉玖
    4月的日本，樱花盛开，由黄阿原先生带领的《樱花梦》剧组来到日本。他说：“我深深了解海外留学生的学习和生活。我希望把他们生活中的酸甜苦辣，把他们吃苦耐劳和热爱祖国的精神制作成一部电视艺术品，献给祖国的年青人，让他们真正了解留学是一件很不容易的事，更希望他们热爱自己的祖国，学习向上。”
    《樱花梦》里的人物——陈静如、林珊、周美惠、崔明义的扮演者，观众们并不陌生，特别是陈道明，他扮演的《末代皇帝》，获得今年“飞天奖”优秀男主角奖。萨仁高娃、高宝宝、徐杨在多部影视片中担任过主演。
    一个由16人组成的《樱花梦》剧组，来到异国他乡拍摄，第一个碰到的困难是语言关。导演沈好放是日本留学回国的，剧组就是他一人会日语，其余的人都成了“聋哑人”，日方只有一名翻译协助。为了高效率拍好这部戏，大家居然创造了一种新的语言——手语。灯光葛树文就用这种奇妙的语言与他的日本同行卓有成效地配合工作，布光、开灯准确无误，还能从工作谈到个人生活，家庭孩子。还有的同志用英语、汉语再加上简单的日语、手语并且借助于纸笔交谈，也解决不少困难。
    剧组在日本逗留时间只有30天，按惯例，要在这么短的时间里拍完三集电视剧，是很困难的。剧组又是在异国他乡，环境不熟，语言不通，生活不惯。工作和生活就和剧情那样绷得紧紧的。早上三、四点钟起床，随即赶往拍摄场地。晚上，回到宾馆，看完当天拍好的片子，还要研究第二天的工作，一直到深夜一、二点。这样一干就是二十多天，我们住在日本大阪，连市容、商店都没有逛过，更不用说去游览胜地。剧组的工作精神和效率受到了日本同行的好评；驻大阪的总领事也多次赞扬我们剧组。
    电视剧《樱花梦》原名《留学生》，在日本，留学生们边学习边打工。剧组就在留学生学习的大学里拍摄学习，打工的饭店里拍他们打工。在樱花烂漫的大阪城公园里，留学生举行赏樱会。留学生和剧组的演员们一起唱起怀念祖国、故乡、母亲的歌，大家眼里噙着泪花，感情十分真挚。樱花季节，日本风俗是扶老携幼，全家出动到公园去赏花。如此众多的群众，我们向他们说明了情况，是中国摄制组来日本拍电视剧，他们爽快地让出最好的赏花位置。围观的青年人，是那样有秩序，静静地在一旁观看演员们的表演。使我们顺利完成了这个宏大的群众场面的摄制。
    不少著名的日本演员参加了拍摄，山田师蜜子扮演的慈祥、好客的日本大娘，把从中国来的三个女学生，当做自己的女儿看待，照顾周到，体贴入微。这种友好情谊不仅在剧中反映出来，而且在剧外处处渗透着。一位日本友人全家住到别处，把自己的住房借给摄制组作留学生的住地。我们每到一处拍摄，不管是机场、医院，还是学校、饭店，一律开绿灯，大力支持。大阪机场大厅里各方旅客川流不息，仍腾出时间供我们拍摄林珊等到达日本的镜头，这在日本是破天荒的第一次，使我们时时处处体会到中日友谊的温暖。
    黄阿原是这部电视剧的策划人，剧情的构思、剧本的创作、剧组的成立、经费的筹措，都倾注了他的心血，他一戏兼三职，编剧、导演、演员。他在剧中扮演一位华侨巨商的长子，和为他补习汉语的女留学生相爱，结成伉俪。他扮演的角色以及执导的电视剧都能看到他的个性影子——豪爽中见细腻，倜傥中见稳实，这些印象随着《樱花梦》的播映，将递送给电视观众。（附图片）
