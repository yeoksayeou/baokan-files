This article provides you with nine strategies to politely avoid unnecessary idle chatter.

1. Avoid drawing attention to yourself and try to make others overlook your presence. This way, you will have fewer opportunities to be invited to engage in idle chatter.

2. Do not decorate your office like a reception room. Unless necessary, keep the number of chairs to a minimum. Additionally, avoid having elegant calendars, small decorations on your desk, and snacks, as these can attract people who want to chat.

3. Stand up to greet visitors. This is polite, and if you maintain a standing position, the visitor will not linger.

4. Minimize small talk and keep your responses concise to quickly send away visitors who have no important business to discuss.

5. Conclude the conversation quickly. When a discussion drags on, you can say, "Well, I think we've covered everything we needed to discuss."

6. Interrupt. If someone is rambling on, you can interrupt and politely say, "I'm sorry, I really don't understand what you're trying to say."

7. Set a time. If you encounter a colleague known for being talkative, you can respond, "Not now, come to my office at 3 PM, okay?" You can then easily end the conversation at 3:15 PM by mentioning you have a meeting.

8. Avoid staring out the window in thought, as this makes it easy for others to think you are not busy. Instead, make some obvious work gestures to show that you are very busy.

9. Be honest, especially with your supervisor, because they should be happy to know that you are busy working and do not have time for idle chatter.

　　怎样摆脱闲聊
    本文向你提供九条对策，可使你得体地摆脱无益的闲聊。
    一、避免惹人注意，尽量让别人忽略你的存在。这样你被邀请参加闲聊的机会就少一些。
    二、办公室不要布置得像接待室。除非必要，椅子要尽可能少。另外一些精致的挂历以及办公桌上的小摆设，还有零食，也容易招来闲聊者。
    三、站起来和客人打招呼。一来这是礼貌，二来你如果保持站立姿势，对方就不会逗留不走。
    四、少寒暄，回答尽量简明，以便很快将没有要事相谈的客人送走。
    五、尽快作结论。当交谈持续太久时，你不妨这样说：“嗯，我想我们该说的都说了。”
    六、插话。有人对你东拉西扯，你可以打断他的话头，并委婉地说：“抱歉，我实在听不懂，不知道你到底想说什么？”
    七、定时间。假如碰到一个罗嗦出名的同事约你谈话，你可以回答：“现在不行，下午三点到我的办公室来好不好？”你心里明白那时有个会，于是你轻而易举地在三点一刻就结束了谈话。
    八、不要盯着窗外思考问题，这样别人很难以为你正在工作，而不是出神。因此作出一些明显的做事动作，表示你正忙得很。
    九、说实话，特别是对上司说实话，因为他应该乐于知道你正忙于工作，没时间陪他闲聊天。
