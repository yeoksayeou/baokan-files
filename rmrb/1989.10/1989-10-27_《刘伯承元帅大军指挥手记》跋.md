The publication of "Field Marshal Liu Bocheng's Military Command Notes" on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China fills me with great joy. This book is a meticulously selected and annotated volume of Liu's extensive military writings, focusing on the art of command. A significant portion of these works have never been publicly released since the founding of the nation. As I close the book and reflect, I am transported back to the unforgettable years when we fought bravely under the command of Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng.

Field Marshal Liu Bocheng is one of the founders and a great pioneer of the People's Liberation Army of China. Throughout his long revolutionary struggle, he remained steadfast in his revolutionary beliefs, risking his life for the party and the people, and accumulating rich experience in real combat and command. At the same time, he was a lifelong learner, diligently studying Marxist theory and military classics from both China and abroad, integrating theoretical knowledge with the realities of the Chinese revolutionary war. In strategic operations and major battles, he demonstrated extraordinary military talent. Commander Zhu once praised him, saying, "His military theory is profound, and he has made many innovations. He possesses the qualities of benevolence, trustworthiness, wisdom, courage, and strictness, embodying the spirit of ancient great generals and is a rare military genius." Chairman Deng praised him for dedicating "all his energy to the nation, the people, and his party" (Deng Xiaoping Selected Works (1938-1965), page 30).

Over many years of military service, Deng Xiaoping and Liu Bocheng worked closely together for a total of 13 years, their relationship was extremely harmonious, and their work was highly coordinated. The phrase "Liu and Deng are inseparable" became a famous saying. (Twenty-Eight Years—From Division Commander to General Secretary, page 3). The book includes valuable joint command orders, directives, and summary reports signed by Liu and Deng during their battles. I worked in the units led by Liu and Deng for many years, personally experiencing and witnessing their superb command skills. Many of their profound insights on leading troops and fighting battles have become guidelines for our military commanders, memorable and inspiring.

This book begins with the "Letter of Salutation to Comrade Liu Bocheng" from the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and includes Chairman Deng's "In Memory of Bocheng" as the preface, which will help readers gain a comprehensive understanding of Field Marshal Liu Bocheng. The book also includes Tang Pingzhu's diary "Day and Night on the Battlefield of Sujilu" and Li Fangshi's "Nine Golden Months—The Friendship News on the Battlefield of Sujilu" as appendices, which will undoubtedly aid readers in understanding the history.

Field Marshal Liu Bocheng's command art and battle strategies are an important part of Mao Zedong's military thought. They hold significant political and historical value for us today in building a modernized and regularized People's Army. I hope that all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army will read this book, draw lessons from it, and truly pass on the precious legacy left by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, carrying on their work and moving forward forever!

　　《刘伯承元帅大军指挥手记》跋

    《刘伯承元帅大军指挥手记》在建国40周年之际出版了，我十分高兴。这是刘帅浩繁的军事著作中，偏重指挥艺术的一个精确选注本。其中大部分著作，是建国以来从未公开发表过的。掩卷细思，重温那段难忘的历史，仿佛又回到了我们在刘师长、邓政委指挥下英勇战斗的岁月之中。
    刘伯承元帅是中国人民解放军的缔造者和开国元勋之一。在长期的革命斗争中，他以坚定的革命信念为本，为了党和人民的事业，出生入死，浴血奋战，积累了丰富的实战经验和指挥经验。同时，他学而不倦，刻苦钻研马克思主义理论和古今中外军事典籍，把书本上的理论与中国革命战争的实际紧密结合，在指挥战略行动和重大战役中，表现出非凡的军事才能。朱总司令曾经夸誉他“在军事理论上造诣很深，创造很多。他具有仁、信、智、勇、严的军人品质，有古名将风，是不可多得的将才。”邓主席称赞他把“全部精力献给了国家、人民和自己的党”（《邓小平文选》（1938——1965年）第30页）。
    在多年的戎马生涯中，邓小平和刘伯承亲密合作，前后共事达13年，两人感情非常融洽，工作非常协调，“刘邓不可分”被传为佳话。（《二十八年间——从师政委到总书记》第3页）。卷中选编的刘邓首长指挥作战时共同签署的作战命令、指示以及总结报告，十分珍贵。我在刘邓首长领导的部队工作多年，亲身经历和耳闻目睹了刘邓首长高超的指挥艺术，他们许许多多带兵打仗的精辟论述，成为我军部队指挥员自觉行动的准则，脍炙人口，令人难忘。
    这本书以中国共产党第十一届中央委员会第七次全体会议《给刘伯承同志的致敬信》作卷首，中央军委邓主席的《悼伯承》作代序，可以帮助读者全面地了解刘伯承元帅。卷中还选用了唐平铸的日记《冀鲁豫战场的日日夜夜》，李方诗的《黄金般的九个月——〈战友报〉在冀鲁豫战场》作为附录，相信对读者了解历史是会有帮助的。
    刘伯承元帅的指挥艺术和作战谋略是毛泽东军事思想的重要组成部分，对于我们今天建设现代化、正规化的人民军队，同样具有重大的政治意义和深远的历史意义。希望人民解放军的广大官兵都读一读这本书，从中汲取教益，真正把老一辈无产阶级革命家留下来的宝贵财富，一代一代传下去，继往开来，永远前进！
