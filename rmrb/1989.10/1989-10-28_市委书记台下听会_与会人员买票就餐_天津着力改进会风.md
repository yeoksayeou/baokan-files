The municipal Party secretary attends meetings from the audience, and participants buy tickets for meals. Tianjin is committed to improving meeting culture.

BEIJING, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) — To genuinely improve leadership style and strengthen anti-corruption efforts, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee has proposed reducing formalism and bureaucratism in meetings, strictly controlling the attendance of leaders at such gatherings. For general work meetings, no platform will be set up, unrelated leaders will not attend, and those who must participate will sit in the audience. Whoever speaks will go on stage. Starting from the municipal Party committee and government, the city is determined to cut, reduce, merge, and shrink meetings. Leaders must take the lead in improving meeting culture.

The recent meeting of district and county organization department heads in Tianjin showed the city's resolve and action. The venue had only one podium, and whoever spoke went on stage. Unrelated leaders did not attend. Municipal Party Secretary Tan Shaowen and the participants sat together in the audience. Except for those from the suburbs who had to travel far, all participants from the city stayed at home. Everyone bought tickets for lunch at the canteen, and there was no movie screening. The fresh and frugal meeting culture has sparked a strong response among officials and the public across the city.

　　市委书记台下听会　与会人员买票就餐
　　天津着力改进会风
    本报天津10月26日电　记者梁小琴报道：为切实改进领导作风，加强廉政建设，天津市委提出：要减少会议中的形式主义和官僚主义，严格控制领导干部陪会。一般性工作会议，一律不设主席台，无关领导不陪会，必须参加的在台下就座，谁发言谁上台。从市委、市政府做起，下决心砍、减、并、缩会议，领导干部要带头改进会风。
    日前结束的天津市区县局组织部长会议，使人们看到了市委的决心和行动。会场只摆一个讲台，谁发言谁上台，无关的领导没有出席。市委书记谭绍文和与会同志一起，坐在听众席上。除郊县远道而来的同志住宿外，市内与会人员一律在家住，中午大家在餐厅买票就餐，更没有电影招待。清新俭朴的会风，在全市干部群众中引起强烈反映。
