This year, eight more national ministries and companies have established contact points in impoverished areas to carry out targeted poverty alleviation. They are: the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Aerospace, the Ministry of Metallurgy, the Ministry of Railways, the National Tourism Administration, the General Company of Nonferrous Metals, the General Company of Nuclear Industry, and the China State Construction Engineering Corporation.

According to the Office of the Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas under the State Council, as of now, 36 national ministries and companies have established poverty alleviation contact points in impoverished areas. Additionally, the Ministry of Communications, the China National Petroleum Corporation, and the China Insurance Corporation have expanded their scope of support this year, establishing new poverty alleviation contact points on top of continuing to support their original contact points.

These ministries and companies have established their poverty alleviation contact points in the remote, harsh, and difficult-to-work-in regions of the Great Southwest and the Great Northwest, which are the main battlefields for solving the problem of basic sustenance over the next two years. So far, all 18 contiguous impoverished areas in the country have basically established contact with national government agencies.

The work of national government agencies establishing contact points for poverty alleviation and helping impoverished areas become prosperous has been carried out for over three years, with remarkable results. The earliest units to implement targeted support for impoverished areas, including the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the State Education Commission, have sent economic development teams for 2-3 consecutive years. In the Dabie Mountains area linked by the State Science and Technology Commission, the Jinggang Mountains area linked by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Wuling Mountains area linked by the Ministry of Agriculture, most of the impoverished counties have solved the problem of basic sustenance.

    又一批部委公司定点扶贫
    全国18片贫困地区都有挂钩联系的国家机关单位
    本报讯　今年以来，又有8个国家部委、公司到贫困地区建立联系点，进行定点扶贫。他们是：轻工业部、航空航天部、冶金部、铁道部、国家旅游局、有色金属总公司、核工业总公司和中国建筑工程总公司。
    据国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组办公室介绍，到目前为止，共有36个国家部委、公司在贫困地区建立了扶贫联系点。另外，交通部、石化总公司和中国保险总公司在继续扶持原有联系点的基础上，今年又扩大范围，建立了新的扶贫联系点。
    这些部委、公司挂钩扶贫的联系点均建在路途遥远、条件艰苦、工作难度大的大西南、大西北，而这些地区正是今明两年解决温饱攻坚战的主战场。到目前为止，全国18个集中连片的贫困地区，基本上都有挂钩联系的国家机关单位。
    国家机关单位挂钩扶贫、帮助贫困地区致富的工作已经开展3年多，成效十分显著。最早实行定点扶持贫困地区的中国科协、国家民委、农业部、林业部、民政部、地矿部、化工部、国家教委等13个单位，连续2—3年派出经济开发工作团。在国家科委联系的大别山区、民政部联系的井冈山区、农业部联系的武陵山区，大多数贫困县已解决温饱问题。　（王万恒　姜立）
