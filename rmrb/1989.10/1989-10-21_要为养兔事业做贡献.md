On April 15th, the sixth edition of your newspaper published my letter titled "The Hardships of a 'Specialized Household'—Whom Should I Appeal To?" After that, I immediately received a great deal of attention and support from people in various sectors of society.

The leaders of the National Product and Material Exchange Office, including Director Cui Tie Liang, have repeatedly written to encourage me to continue developing my rabbit-raising business and to contribute to China's rabbit-raising industry. To utilize my skills and expertise, they have appointed me as a technical staff member for livestock breeding at the National Product and Material Exchange Office.

Comrade Liu Jianmin from a certain department in Tianjin has repeatedly written to me, offering to send my children to his hometown in Ren County, Hebei, to attend school.

Because of the warm care and concern shown by so many leaders and comrades, I will certainly not let down their high expectations. I am determined to do a good job in my rabbit-raising business.

专栏：

　　要为养兔事业做贡献
    4月15日，你报第六版刊登了我写的《“专业户”的苦处向谁诉》的来信后，我立刻得到了社会各界人士的极大关注和支持。
    全国产品材料调剂办公室崔铁良主任等领导同志多次来信鼓励我将养兔事业继续发展下去，为中国的养兔事业做出贡献。为了发挥我的技能专长，聘任我为全国产品材料调剂办公室养殖业技术员。
    天津市某部门刘建民同志多次来信，要我把孩子送到他的家乡河北任县去上学。
    因有这么多的领导和同志们的亲切关怀，我决不辜负他们对我的殷切期望，一定搞好我的养兔事业。
