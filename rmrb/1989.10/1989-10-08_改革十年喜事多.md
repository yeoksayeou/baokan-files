The People's Republic of China is celebrating its 40th anniversary, and I am entering my 60th year. Reflecting on the 40 years I have shared with the Republic, through storms and sunshine, I am overwhelmed with emotions and have so much to say.

In 1948, amidst the thunderous sounds of the People's Liberation War, I brought my wife and children and, risking our lives, escaped from the Nationalist-controlled area to the liberated zone. I joined the embrace of the Communist Party of China, beginning my revolutionary career. This was my first liberation.

"The sky in the liberated zone is clear." In this bright liberated zone, I—a 19-year-old passionate youth—under the warm care of many veteran cadres dressed in "earthy" big cotton coats, fully developed my intelligence and talents. At the provincial party school, I taught revolutionary songs like "Without the Communist Party, There Is No New China" and "Unity Is Strength"; in the parade celebrating the liberation of cities like Shenyang, Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai, there were my giant portraits of the leaders; on campuses and streets, there were my revolutionary slogans: "Cross the Yangtze River and liberate all of China," "Carry the revolution through to the end"…; in the music programs of provincial and municipal radio stations, there were often my performances on various instruments; I also taught language and history to veteran cadres of worker and peasant origin; in "street theater" and "two-person opera" performances, I acted on stage, directed, and played the accompaniment.

The Party's leaders at all levels showed me great care. As soon as I set foot in the liberated zone, I expressed my strong desire to join the Communist Youth League and the Party to the organization. Now, 42 years have passed, and I have long been a member of the Communist Party. I have even been a member for 31 years.

However, looking back at my 40-year revolutionary career, the first 30 years were filled with both countless joys and constant conflicts and suppressed emotions. Especially under the leadership of some narrow-minded superiors, there were always people creating trouble out of nothing, and unfounded accusations would rain down from the sky. During the "unprecedented" ten years, unfounded accusations came one after another. In those "leftist" years, the hardships and difficulties of fate are self-evident.

The "Gang of Four" was overthrown. The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee was convened. The Republic corrected its course, and I gained my second liberation. It can be said that the ten years of reform and opening up are the most comfortable, happiest, and most meaningful ten years in my 60-year journey of life and 42-year revolutionary career! In these ten years, many joyous events have come to me:

1. False and wrong cases were rectified;
2. My painting "High Mountains and Flowing Waters" (reflecting Comrade Deng Xiaoping's climb to the top of Changbai Mountain at the age of 80) won the first prize (gold medal) at the "World Environment Day" exhibition commemorating the United Nations;
3. I was awarded the honorary certificate of "Model Teacher of the People";
4. I was appointed as an "Art Advisor" by the Graduate School of Harbin Institute of Technology;
5. I was elected as a council member of the Chinese Contemporary Fine Brush Painting Society;
6. I won awards in the National Hard Pen Calligraphy Competition and the Changbai Mountain International Calligraphy Competition;
7. I was appointed as a professor of fine arts by Changchun Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics;
8. From 1983 to the present, Shanxi, Jilin, Hebei, and CCTV have reported and introduced my experiences of going deep into coal mines to teach and guide, and creating "High Mountains and Flowing Waters" seven times.

The saying goes, "When good things happen, one feels spirited." How could I not be overjoyed and surprised? My poor wife and children, who have suffered from being implicated, also have their wrinkled brows smoothed out. Many joyous events are the crystallization of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee!

As we welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Republic, I feel that I am becoming younger and more energetic. Looking to the future, the vibrant Republic is full of vitality and strength. Inspired, I composed a couplet to present to my great socialist motherland as a bouquet of red flowers:

Joy comes to the door, remember the good policies of the Third Plenary Session
Welcome the National Day, firmly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles
Horizontal inscription: Long live the motherland

    改革十年喜事多
    吉林省行政学院　胡忠元
    共和国成立40周年，我也迈入花甲之年。回顾我与共和国风雨同舟的40载，不禁心潮翻腾，万语千言。
    1948年，在人民解放战争的隆隆炮火声中，我携妻带子冒着生命危险，逃出了国民党统治区，奔赴解放区，投入中国共产党的怀抱，开始了革命生涯。这是我第一次获得解放。
    “解放区的天，是明朗的天”。在明朗的解放区，我——一个19岁的热血青年，在身着“土八路”吊兜大棉袄的众多老干部热心关怀下，聪明才智得到了充分发挥。在省委党校，我教唱《没有共产党就没有新中国》、《团结就是力量》等革命歌曲；在沈阳、北平、天津、南京、上海等城市庆祝解放的游行队伍里，都有我画的巨幅领袖像；在校园里、大街上，有我写的革命标语：“打过长江去，解放全中国”、“将革命进行到底”……；在省市广播电台音乐节目中，常常有我的多种乐器演奏；我还给工农出身的老干部教语文、历史课；在“活报剧”、“二人转”演出中，我既上台当演员，又担任导演、伴奏。
    党的各级领导对我倍加爱护。而我一踏上解放区的土地，就向组织提出了入团入党的强烈要求。如今42个春秋过去了，我早已是一名共产党员，连退团都31年了。
    然而，回首40年革命生涯，前30年我既有数不尽的欢乐，又常常在矛盾、压抑的心情下生活、工作着。特别是，在个别胸襟不够开阔的顶头上司领导下，总会有人无事生非，“莫须有”的罪名便从天而降。到了“史无前例”的十年，无中生有的罪名更是接踵而至。在那“左”的年代里，命运之坎坷多难，是不言自明的。
      “四人帮”打倒了。党的十一届三中全会召开了。共和国拨正了航向，我也获得了第二次解放。可以这样说，改革开放的十年，是我60载人生旅途和42年革命历程中，最舒畅、最幸福、最有意义的10年！这10载春秋，我有许多喜事临门：
    一，冤假错案平反了；二，《高山流水》（反映邓小平同志80高龄登上长白山顶峰的工笔中国画）获纪念联合国“世界环境日”《祖国环境美》展览一等奖（金牌）；三，吉林大学授予“人民教师的楷模”荣誉证书；四，被哈尔滨工业大学研究生院聘为“艺术顾问”；五，被选为中国当代工笔画学会理事；六，在全国硬笔书法大赛和长白山国际书法大赛中两次获奖；七，被长春光机学院聘为美术教授；八，从1983年至今，山西、吉林、河北和中央电视台先后七次报道、介绍了我深入煤矿讲学、辅导，创作《高山流水》经验体会的电视节目。
    俗语说，人逢喜事精神爽。我怎能不喜上眉梢，喜出望外。受我株连之苦的可怜的老伴和子女紧锁的愁眉也舒展开来了。多喜临门，是党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策的结晶！
    在迎接共和国成立40周年大庆之际，我感到自己越活越年青、越有奔头。展望未来，生气勃勃的共和国，充满生机和力量。兴之所至，凑成楹联一副，作为我——一名人民教师、中国美协会员献给伟大社会主义祖国一束鲜红的小花：
    喜临门应铭记三中全会好政策
    迎国庆须坚持四项原则不动摇
    横批——祖国万岁
