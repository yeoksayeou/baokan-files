He holds the authority to approve loans totaling 260 million yuan. His work involves dealing with the leaders of over 80 commercial enterprises who have long been eager for his assistance. The managers and directors of these enterprises, whom he is in contact with, control the distribution of tens of thousands of commodities essential for daily life.

He has provided strategic advice and secured loans to help these enterprises improve their efficiency and turn losses into profits, contributing significantly to their success.

However, what is truly admirable is that in his nine years of service, despite approving loans worth tens of billions of yuan, he has never accepted gifts, red envelopes, or taken advantage of these enterprises.

He is Wang Jianxing, a 30-year-old member of the Communist Party and an official at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Jinzhou, Liaoning Province.

Four Rules

Wang Jianxing has set four rules for himself: do not use enterprise property, do not accept enterprise gifts, do not take advantage of enterprises, and do not accept enterprise invitations.

Marriage is a significant event in one's life. When the loan officer gets married, it is seen as a golden opportunity for the enterprise managers. In early 1987, when people heard that Wang Jianxing was getting married, they rushed to inquire about the date and prepared to "show their appreciation." The general manager of a large department store in the city, an old acquaintance of Wang's family, hurriedly said, "My nephew's wedding is our family affair, I should take the lead. All the bedding and kitchen supplies in the new room will be provided by me at a price lower than the cost." The manager of a certain store and a wholesale enterprise approached Wang Jianxing and directly asked, "When is the wedding? You can choose between a car, a van, or a bus, as many as you want. If you don't speak up on that day, we will criticize you." A manager dealing with household appliances advised him to have a grand wedding and suggested he return the single-door refrigerator he had bought and instead receive a double-door brand-name refrigerator. However, Wang Jianxing's response to these "kind-hearted" people was simple: "I appreciate your intentions. Everything for the wedding has been arranged by my mother. What hasn't been prepared is what I don't need, so please don't trouble yourselves." No one could find out the specific wedding date. In April, Wang Jianxing took his bride to Beijing for a secret wedding trip. When everyone received the wedding candy, they realized the wedding had already taken place.

Fair and Just

On the door of Wang Jianxing's office, there are four large characters: "Fair and Just." These words are prominently displayed, serving as a reminder to himself and his colleagues, and also to alleviate the concerns of enterprises. Those who come to the Commercial Loan Department for business have the same experience: those who do not meet the loan conditions will not be approved, regardless of who they are; those who meet the loan conditions will be supported, even if funds are tight, to help the enterprise.

The manager of a certain store is an old colleague of Wang Jianxing's mother and has had a long relationship with him. In July 1988, the store collaborated with another enterprise to purchase televisions, requiring a loan of 2.4 million yuan. After investigation, Wang Jianxing found that the transaction had not secured the source of goods or the market, and the contract was not tight enough, so he immediately refused the loan. Later, the store repeatedly approached Wang Jianxing, but he did not agree. During the last visit, the manager said that the participating enterprise had already borrowed over 9 million yuan from another bank, and now they were just waiting for his money. He had just come to this store and couldn't even borrow money to pay salaries, which would be embarrassing. He also said that Wang Jianxing was unyielding. Despite Wang Jianxing's repeated explanations, the manager left in a huff. Unexpectedly, three months later, the manager came to apologize to Wang Jianxing, saying that the original transaction was indeed unreliable, and that not lending the money at that time had been a safeguard for him.

Wang Jianxing's fair and just approach has earned him both praise and criticism, with some even mocking him. However, he pays no heed. To eradicate favoritism in lending, Wang Jianxing also worked with his colleagues to establish a "six-openness" loan system, which was written on the loan allocation board. Over the years, Wang Jianxing has approved loans totaling tens of billions of yuan, with not a single case of favoritism or risky lending.

Starting with Myself

"Starting from the department I am responsible for, using my actions to shape the glorious image of the Party. Although an individual's ability is limited, if everyone does this, our Party's style of work will not be difficult to change." Wang Jianxing often shares this philosophy with his colleagues.

Wang Jianxing leads by example, treating others fairly and putting others before himself. His married brother and parents live in two small rooms, while he and his wife live in a half-room old apartment, yet he gave up his priority in housing allocation to give a two-bedroom apartment with a standard bathroom to someone else. A substantial contract bonus for turning losses into profits was within his reach, but he did not take a single cent, instead giving it to the loan officers. Within the department, he is recognized as an excellent department head and party member.

Wang Jianxing starts from the department he is responsible for, focusing on regulations and ideological work, and implements the "starting with myself" slogan in the actions of every member of the loan department. The loan department staff work independently in the field, requiring strong self-discipline. Out of the 20 staff members, 14 are under 30 years old. To correct the department's work style, he led the formulation of the "ten disciplines" for loan officers and the "ten prohibitions" for clean lending, and distributed them to each affiliated enterprise for supervision, cutting off the possibility of using loans for personal gain through regulations.

The clean department head has trained a strong team. Over the years, the Commercial Loan Department has basically achieved no invitations to dine, no red envelopes, and no gifts. According to incomplete statistics, the department has refused over a hundred invitations and hundreds of gifts, with no disciplinary violations. Wang Jianxing has been repeatedly recognized as an advanced individual and outstanding party member by the branch, city, and provincial bank. In 1987, the Commercial Loan Department was rated as an "advanced collective in loan work" by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China headquarters.

At the end of the interview, Wang Jianxing recited his favorite ancient text:

A thread, a grain, my reputation,
A cent, a mill, the people's fat.
Relax a bit, the people receive more than a bit;
Take a cent, I am not worth a cent.

Indeed! Only when the upright are numerous and the corrupt are few will the great hall of the People's Republic be more stable and glorious!

　　不让权力沾上污点
　　——记锦州市工商银行干部王建兴
　　王汉文
    他手握2亿6千万元贷款审批权。他的工作对象是长年渴求于他的80多家商业企业的掌权人。他所联系这些企业的经理、主任们，掌握着吃、喝、穿、用所需要的几万种商品的经营大权。
    他为这些企业提高效益、扭亏增盈而出谋划策、筹集贷款立下汗马功劳。
    然而令人叹服的是：参加工作九年来，审批贷款数十亿元，他没有接受过这些企业的礼品、红包，没占过企业便宜。
    他就是年仅30岁的共产党员、辽宁锦州市工商银行干部王建兴。
    约法四章
    不用企业财物，不收企业馈赠，不占企业便宜，不受企业吃请，这是王建兴给自己的约法四章。
    结婚是人生大事。信贷科长结婚，对企业经理们来说是天赐良机。1987年初，当人们听说王建兴要结婚时，纷纷来探问日期并准备“表示表示”。市内一家大型商场的总经理是小王家老熟人，闻讯后急忙赶来说：“大外甥结婚是咱的自家事，我得在头前忙活。新房里所有的床上用品和厨房用品我包了，全部低于进价供应。”某商店和一家批发企业负责人找到王建兴劈头就问：“哪天结婚？轿车、面包车、大客车随你挑，要多少辆都行。到那天不吱声我们可要挑你的眼啦。”一位经营家用电器的经理劝他结婚时好好热闹热闹，并叫他退掉买来的单门冰箱，再送他一台双门名牌货……然而，王建兴对这些“热心人”的回答也很简单：“你们的心意我领了。凡是结婚用的东西，我母亲都筹办了。没有预备的也是我不需要的，请不必再费心了。”具体婚期谁也没打听出来。4月份王建兴带着新娘到北京秘密旅行结婚。当大家接到喜糖的时候，才知道婚事早已办完了。
    秉公办事
    在王建兴的办公室大门上有“秉公办事”四个大字。字很醒目，既提醒自己和同事，又解除企业顾虑。到商业信贷科办事的人都有这样的体会：不符合贷款条件的谁来也不行；符合贷款条件的，即使资金再紧张也千方百计帮助筹措，支持企业。
    某商店经理是王建兴母亲的老同事，与小王也有多年联系。1988年7月，该店与某企业联合购买彩电，需贷款240万元。经过调查，王建兴发现这笔交易货源、市场均没落实，合同也不够严密，当即表示不能贷款。后来商店多次找王建兴也没应允。最后一次这位经理说，参与联合的企业已经从某银行贷到900多万元，现在就等他的钱了。他刚来这家商店，连点款都贷不出来就没面子了。他还说小王六亲不认。尽管王建兴再三解释，这位经理还是拂袖而去。没想到3个月后，这位经理找小王道歉来了。说原来那笔交易果真不托底，当时没给贷款是替他把了关。
    王建兴秉公办事有人夸也有人骂，有人则冷嘲热讽，但他并不理会。为了带动全科切实杜绝人情贷款，小王还和大家制订了贷款“六公开”制度，并书写在贷款投向投量板上。几年来，王建兴累计发放贷款数十亿元，没有一笔人情贷款和风险贷款。
    从我做起
    “从我所负责的部门做起，用自己的行动去塑造党的光辉形象。一个人的能力虽然有限，但如果人人都这样做，我们的党风就不难转变。”王建兴经常与同事讲这番道理。
    王建兴从自己做起，对外秉公办事，对内先人后己。他已婚的弟弟和父母挤住在二间房内，他和爱人借住着一室半的旧楼房，却在自己分房积分领先的情况下，把二室一厅、带标准卫生间的新房让给了别人；一笔数额可观的扭亏增盈合同兑现奖金本来唾手可得，他却分文不取，让给了信贷员……在科内他是人人公认的好科长、好党员。
    王建兴从自己所负责的部门做起，抓制度，做思想政治工作，把“从我做起”的口号落实到信贷科每一个成员的行动中。信贷科人员下基层基本是独立工作，需要有较强的自律能力。全科20人，有14名是30岁以下的青年。为了把全科风气带正，他主持制订了信贷员纪律“十条”和为贷清廉的“十不准”，并且印发给所属的每个企业监督，从制度上切断以贷谋私。
    廉洁的科长终于带出了过硬的队伍。几年来，商业信贷科基本上做到了请吃不到，红包不要，送礼不收。据不完全统计，全科拒请百余次，拒礼数百件，无违章违纪现象。王建兴多次被评为办事处、市行、省行先进个人、优秀党员。1987年，商业信贷科被中国工商银行总行评为“信贷工作先进集体”。
    采访结束时，王建兴念起了他最喜爱的一段古文：
    一丝一粒我之名节，
    一厘一毫民之脂膏。
    宽一分，民受赐不止一分；
    取一文，我为人不值一文。
    是啊！只有廉者甚众，贪者甚寡，人民共和国的大厦才会愈益稳固、辉煌！（附图片）
