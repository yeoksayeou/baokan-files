The CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have made investigating and handling cases of party and government leaders using their power to build private houses a key part of their anti-corruption efforts. This is currently being carried out throughout the province.

The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Guangdong Provincial Government have repeatedly emphasized the need to resolutely stop the practice of party members and cadres using their power for personal gain in housing construction and renovation. However, some party members and cadres in certain places and units in Guangdong, including some county-level and above party and government leaders, have ignored these directives and continued to use their power to build private houses. In March of this year, the Guangdong Provincial Committee decided to implement public supervision over the housing construction and renovation of party and government leaders, and to seriously investigate and handle cases of party and government cadres using their power for personal gain in housing construction and renovation. The "Opinions on Implementing Public Supervision over the Housing Construction and Renovation of Party and Government Leaders" were issued, stipulating that all township-level and above party and government leaders who have built private houses or renovated public housing since 1983 must register their information. Their housing construction and renovation situations must be made public to the same-level leading cadres and party members and cadres in their units, accepting supervision from within and outside the party. The situation of public supervision in various places shows that since 1983, there have been 9,280 county-level and above party and government cadres in the province who have built private houses, accounting for approximately 10% of the total number of party and government cadres at the same level.

According to investigations, there are indeed some cases of party and government cadres using their power for personal gain among those who have built private houses. The main issues are: first, occupying a large amount of land and having a large building area; second, some leaders using their power to purchase land and building materials at a lower price, damaging the interests of the state and collective; third, many cadres taking out loans to build private houses, occupying state funds; fourth, some leaders building private houses not to solve housing difficulties but to rent out or operate for profit; fifth, some leaders have unclear sources of funds for building private houses, with many doubts, and even issues of embezzlement and bribery.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government first strengthened leadership in handling the problems of party and government cadres building private houses. They then selected typical cases of using power to build houses and published them in newspapers to expose them to the public. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Provincial Construction Commission, Provincial Supervision Bureau, and Provincial Land Administration Bureau formulated the "Regulations on Handling the Problems of Party and Government Cadres Building Private Houses," which detailed the handling of issues related to land, funding sources, building materials sources, and construction labor sources for party and government cadres building private houses. This ensures that those who use their power to build houses do not continue to benefit economically or evade discipline and law. According to incomplete statistics, there have been 75 cases of party and government cadres using their power to build private houses in violation of discipline and law that have been investigated, with 21 cases already concluded.

Huazhou County People's Congress Standing Committee Director Li Dapu, who already had several houses for his family, used his power in 1987 to purchase two plots of land through the county real estate development company and built a private house in his wife's name with a building area of 1,042.76 square meters. He paid less for building materials, transportation fees, and land fees, totaling over 30,000 yuan, and was expelled from the party and removed from his position. The economic issues related to his construction of the private house are being handled by relevant departments according to law. Mei County Water Conservancy and Electric Power Bureau Deputy Director He Quanlan, in 1986, took advantage of his position as the deputy commander of the Meixian Flood Control and Drainage South Bank Project Construction Command to collude with a contractor. While constructing the dam and bridge, he had the contractor build a private house of over 400 square meters for him. In the end, he used the method of the government giving more project funds while he gave less for the house, illegally gaining over 60,000 yuan. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. The leaders who used their power to build houses, such as Doumen County Committee Secretary Mai Xiaozhou and Suixi County Committee Deputy Secretary Li Bing, are also being investigated.

    公开干部建房情况　选择典型案例披露
    广东着力查处以权谋房行为
    据新华社广州10月17日电　（记者雷仲予、欧阳鸿鹄）中共广东省委、省人民政府把查处党政领导干部以权谋建私房的违纪违法行为，作为反腐败的重要内容，正在全省深入进行。
    党中央、国务院和广东省曾三令五申，要坚决制止党员、干部在建房、住房中以权谋私的歪风，但广东省一些地方和单位少数党员、干部，包括有的县以上党政领导干部却置若罔闻，仍在以权谋私营建私房。今年3月，广东省委决定对全省党政领导干部建私房和住房装修情况实行公开监督，严肃查处党政干部在建房、住房中严重以权谋私的问题，颁布了《关于对党政领导干部建私房和住房装修情况实行公开监督的意见》，规定全省乡镇以上各级现职党政领导干部，凡1983年以来建了私房和对自己居住的公房进行过装修的，都要进行登记，同时将建私房和住房装修情况向同级几套领导班子和本人所在单位的党员、干部公开，接受党内外监督。各地实行公开监督的情况表明，1983年以来，全省各市、县科级以上党政干部建私房的共有9280人，约占同级党政干部总数的10％。
    据调查，这些营建私房的党政干部中确实存在一些以权谋私的问题。主要表现在：一是占地多，建筑面积大；二是一些领导干部利用职权压价或低价购买地皮和建筑材料，损害国家和集体的利益；三是不少干部贷款建私房，挤占国家资金；四是有些领导干部建私房已经不是为了解决住房困难，而是用于出租或经营牟利；五是有的领导干部建私房的资金来源不清，疑点大，甚至有贪污受贿问题。
    广东省委、省政府在处理党政干部营建私房中的问题时首先加强领导，然后选择以权谋房的典型事例在报纸上刊登，使其在群众中“曝光”。与此同时，广东省纪委、省建委、省监察厅和国土厅制定了《关于处理党政干部建私房问题的规定》，对党政干部建私房的用地、资金来源、建筑材料来源、施工劳力来源等方面的问题的处理，均作了详细的规定，不使以权谋房者在经济上继续得到好处或继续逍遥于纪律、法律之外。据不完全统计，全省已立案审查的以权谋私违纪违法建私房的案件共75宗，已结案21宗。
    化州县人大常委会主任李达权，一家大小本来已有几处住房，1987年利用职权，通过县房地产开发公司购买两块地皮，以其妻子的名义报建私房，建筑面积达1042.76平方米，少付建筑材料款、装运费和地皮费共计3万余元，受到开除党籍和撤销职务的处分。对其营建私房中的经济问题，另由有关部门依法处理。梅州市水利电力局副局长何全兰，1986年乘兼任梅州防洪治涝江南大堤工程建设指挥部副指挥之机，与包工头串通，在承建大堤闸桥的同时，为其承建400多平方米的私人楼房，最后以公家多给工程款而自己少给建房款的办法，白白占了6万余元的便宜，被判处有期徒刑14年。斗门县委书记麦小洲，遂溪县委副书记李炳等以权谋房的领导干部，也正在查处之中。
