	"Treasure and rationally use every inch of land, and effectively protect arable land" is one of China's fundamental policies. However, "treasuring every inch of land" has not yet been as widely recognized by society as the implementation of family planning. If in the population issue, we only learned the lesson after the population increased by several hundred million, then in the land issue, due to the reduction of arable land and insufficient reserve resources, what serious consequences will be produced in the future? It seems that a considerable number of people are still indifferent to this. This is the seriousness of the problem.

	The potential crisis of China's land resources is already quite severe. From 1949 to now, China's population has doubled. In the past 10 years, the national population has increased by 133 million, equivalent to the population of one Sichuan Province plus one Shanghai City; the average annual increase is more than 15 million, equivalent to the population of Australia. On the other hand, in the past 10 years, China's arable land has decreased by more than 55 million mu, equivalent to the arable land area of one Shanxi Province, and the average annual reduction is equivalent to the arable land area of one Shanghai City. Per capita arable land has decreased from 2.7 mu in 1949 to 1.3 mu in 1988. In 40 years, per capita arable land has been halved, and 1/3 of the provinces have less than 1 mu of per capita arable land. China's grain yield and total production have both increased by 3.5 times compared to the early days of liberation, but per capita grain consumption has only increased by 1.8 times. The report submitted by the National Conditions Analysis Research Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences believes: According to the subsistence level, the theoretical maximum carrying capacity of China's land resources potential natural productivity is about 1.5 to 1.6 billion people. Under the condition of strict population control, by 2030 (that is, in about 40 years), China's population will exceed the carrying capacity.

	The potential crisis of China's land resources has been aggravated by the irrational land use system, serious waste in land use, and the phenomenon of violating laws and regulations and replacing laws with power. According to incomplete statistics of 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, there were 387,000 cases of illegal land occupation in 1988, and the problem is still quite serious. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects: In coastal areas, due to the impact of overheated economic development, projects are blindly expanded, and illegal land occupation is prominent; some local governments and leading cadres exceed their authority to approve land, and many party and government cadres illegally occupy land to build private houses; the proportion of farmers illegally occupying land to build houses is high, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of illegal land occupation cases; destroying the public ownership of land, illegally buying and selling and transferring land, seeking illegal profits for units or individuals.

	The potential crisis of China's land resources is one of the main obstacles that have long plagued China's modernization construction. To alleviate and ultimately overcome this crisis, it is necessary to rectify, reform, and comprehensively manage it from now on, with long-term planning, overall arrangement, and comprehensive governance.

	At present, the awareness of many of our comrades is lagging behind, and they cannot see the potential crisis, and even blindly optimistic about "vast territory and abundant resources." For example, some people say: "Arable land is allocated to households, and farmers have the right to use the land freely." Others say: "The state builds factories to enrich the country, and farmers run enterprises to enrich the people. Occupying more arable land is not a big deal." Some local leaders have short-sighted behavior of pursuing the economic interests of their own regions and departments, believing that "the land problem will have a way when the car reaches the mountain, and there is no need to worry." Some responsible persons of land-using departments even think that "non-agricultural construction land has higher economic benefits than agricultural construction land" and "money can buy grain." Little do they know how precious these lands are, which have been developed and cultivated by the Chinese nation for thousands of years, and are fundamentally incomparable and immeasurable with temporary economic benefits.

	"People rely on food for their lives, and food relies on land." If we do not treasure every inch of land, in a few decades, we will face not a potential land crisis, but the real arrival of a land crisis. I sincerely hope that through this discussion, people from all walks of life can put forward insightful opinions and work together to improve China's land management.

　　增一倍与减一半
　　——正视潜在的土地危机
　　国家土地管理局局长　王先进
      “十分珍惜和合理利用每寸土地，切实保护耕地”是我国基本国策之一。然而，“珍惜每寸土地”至今还没有像实行计划生育那样引起社会的普遍重视。如果说在人口问题上，我们是等到多增加了几亿人后才接受了教训，那么在土地问题上，由于耕地减少和后备资源不足，将来会产生什么严重后果，相当一部人目前似乎还在漠然视之。这就是问题的严重性。
    我国土地资源潜在的危机已经相当严峻。1949年到现在，我国的人口翻了一番。近10年全国人口就增加了1.33亿，相当于增加一个四川省加上海市的人口；平均每年增加1500多万人，相当于澳大利亚全国的人口。另一方面，近10年我国耕地减少了5500多万亩，相当于减少了一个山西省的耕地面积，平均每年抹掉了相当于一个上海市的耕地面积。人均耕地已由1949年的2.7亩下降到1988年的1.3亩。40年中人均耕地减少了一半，有1／3的省人均耕地已不足1亩。我国粮食单产和总产都比解放初提高了3.5倍，人均消费粮食却只提高1.8倍。中国科学院国情分析研究小组提出的报告认为：按温饱水平计算，我国土地资源潜在自然生产力的理论最大承载人口能力约为15至16亿人。在严格控制人口的条件下，到2030年
  （也就是再过40年左右时间），我国人口就将突破承载极限。
    我国土地资源的这种潜在的危机，由于土地使用制度的不合理，在土地利用上存在着十分严重的浪费现象和有法不依、以权代法的现象，从而被人为地加剧。据对24个省、区、市的不完全统计，1988年共发生违法占地案件38.7万件，问题仍然相当严重。这主要表现在如下几方面：沿海地区由于受经济发展过热的影响，盲目铺摊子上项目，违法占地问题突出；部分地方政府和领导干部越权批地，不少党政干部违法占地建私房；农民违法占地建房比例高，占违法占地案件总数的90％以上；破坏土地公有制，非法买卖和转让土地，为单位或个人牟取暴利。
    我国土地资源的潜在危机，是长期困扰我国现代化建设的主要障碍因素之一。要缓解此事并最终克服这一危机，必须治理、整顿，深化改革；从现在抓起，长远规划，统筹安排，综合治理。
      当前，我们不少同志的认识还跟不上，看不到潜在的危机，甚至盲目乐观于“地大物博”，例如有人说：“耕地分到户了，农民对土地有随便使用的权利。”也有人说：
  “国家建工厂为富国，农民办企业为富民，多占点耕地不算啥。”一些地方的领导存在着片面追求本地区、本部门经济利益的短期行为，认为“土地问题车到山前必有路，不必杞人忧天”。有不少用地部门的负责人甚至认为“非农业建设用地比农业建设用地经济效益高”，“有钱就有粮”。殊不知，中华民族历经几千年开发耕作至今的这些土地是多么宝贵，是根本无法以一时的经济收益来比较和衡量的。
      “民以食为天，食以土为本”。如不珍惜每寸土地，那用不了几十年，我们面对的将不是潜在的土地危机，而将是土地危机的真正来临。我衷心希望通过这次讨论，各界有识之士能够提出真知灼见，共同搞好我国的土地管理工作。
