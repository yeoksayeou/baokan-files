Commander-in-Chief of the KPNLF, Son Sen, Reiterates the Stand of a Comprehensive Political Solution to the Cambodian Issue

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 14th: Commander-in-Chief of the KPNLF, Son Sen, once again guaranteed that after the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the KPNLF side will respect the results of free elections supervised by the United Nations and headed by the interim government of the four parties led by Prince Sihanouk.

Son Sen made these remarks on October 11th during a meeting with reporters from the Japan Broadcasting Corporation Television in a liberated area camp in Cambodia. The Democratic Kampuchea Radio broadcasted Son Sen's conversation with the Japanese reporters today. During the meeting, Son Sen expounded on the KPNLF's stance on a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue, reiterating that the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the formation of a four-party interim coalition government in Cambodia are the two key points to a comprehensive solution.

Son Sen said that the current objective of the KPNLF in fighting the Vietnamese invaders on the battlefield is not to seize power again, but to force Vietnam to agree to a just and comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue as soon as possible.

Son Sen emphasized that to defend and build the motherland, the KPNLF, whether now or in the future after liberation, will always adhere to the policy of national unity. The KPNLF reiterated that currently, Prince Sihanouk is the leader of the Cambodian resistance forces, and in the future, Prince Sihanouk will be the head of state of Cambodia.

Son Sen believes that in the future, Cambodia will become a peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned country.

    民柬国民军总司令宋成
    重申全面政治解决柬问题立场
    据新华社北京10月14日电  民柬国民军总司令宋成再次保证，在越南全部撤军后，民柬方面将尊重由联合国监督的、由以西哈努克亲王为首的4方临时政府主持的自由大选的结果。
    宋成是10月11日在柬埔寨某解放区营地会见日本广播协会电视台的记者时说这番话的。民主柬埔寨电台今天广播了宋成对日本记者的谈话。宋成在会见时，阐述了民柬方面对全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的立场，重申越南全部撤军和组成柬埔寨4方临时联合政府是全面解决的两个关键。
    宋成说，民柬方面目前继续在战场上打击越南侵略者的目的，不是为了民柬方面再次单独掌权，而是为了迫使越南答应尽快公正、全面地政治解决柬埔寨问题。
    宋成强调，为了保卫祖国、建设祖国，民柬方面，无论现在或将来获得解放之后，都始终贯彻民族大团结政策。民柬方面重申，现在西哈努克亲王是柬埔寨抵抗力量领袖，将来西哈努克亲王是柬国家元首。
    宋成认为，将来柬埔寨要成为一个和平、中立和不结盟的国家。
