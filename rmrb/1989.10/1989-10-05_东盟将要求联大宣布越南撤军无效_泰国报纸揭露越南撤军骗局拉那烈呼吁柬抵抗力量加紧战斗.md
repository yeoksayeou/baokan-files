ASEAN to Demand UNGA Declare Vietnamese Withdrawal Invalid

Thai Newspaper Exposes Vietnamese Withdrawal Hoax; Ranariddh Urges Cambodian Resistance to Intensify Fighting

UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) — ASEAN countries have drafted a resolution calling for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) to declare Vietnam's self-proclaimed complete withdrawal from Cambodia invalid.

In a draft resolution on the Cambodian issue prepared today, ASEAN countries pointed out that a withdrawal without UN supervision, control, and verification does not conform to the comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian issue. Therefore, it cannot bring lasting peace to Cambodia or allow the Cambodian people to truly exercise their right to self-determination. This draft resolution is currently being circulated among representatives attending the UNGA, seeking support.

Vietnam announced that it had withdrawn all its troops from Cambodia on September 26. However, ASEAN countries stated in the draft resolution that the so-called "complete withdrawal" was not subject to international supervision, and Vietnam itself has not ruled out the possibility of re-invading Cambodia.

BANGKOK, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Thai newspaper "Bangkok Post" today, a Vietnamese military unit is fighting alongside the Phnom Penh government's troops in northwestern Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey Province.

The newspaper quoted a well-informed source from the Thai military as saying that these Vietnamese troops, whose exact number is unknown, originally belonged to the Vietnamese 302nd Infantry Division. They later joined the Phnom Penh government's 286th Infantry Division to defend the district of Ta Lon.

BANGKOK, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) — Prince Norodom Ranariddh, commander-in-chief of the Khmer People's National Liberation Forces, called on the Cambodian resistance forces to intensify their fighting on October 3, to thwart Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime's attempt to create a "fait accompli" in Cambodia.

The Thai newspaper "Nation" today quoted Ranariddh as saying that this "fait accompli" aims to make people acknowledge Vietnam's "withdrawal" and the Phnom Penh regime's control over the situation.

    东盟将要求联大宣布越南撤军无效
    泰国报纸揭露越南撤军骗局拉那烈呼吁柬抵抗力量加紧战斗
    新华社联合国10月3日电（记者钱文荣）东盟国家已经起草了一项决议草案，要求联大宣布越南自己宣称的已从柬埔寨全部撤军是无效的。
    东盟国家在今天拟定的一份关于柬埔寨问题的决议草案中指出，没有联合国监督、控制和核查的撤军不符合全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的方案，因此不能给柬埔寨带来持久的和平，也不能使柬埔寨人民真正自由行使自决权。这份决议草案正在出席联大的代表中传阅，寻求支持。
    越南宣布它已于9月26日撤走了驻扎在柬埔寨的全部军队。然而，东盟国家在决议草案中说，所谓“全部撤军”没有受到国际监督，越南自己也宣称不排除重新入侵柬埔寨的可能。
    新华社曼谷10月4日电据泰国《曼谷邮报》今天报道，有一支越军在柬埔寨西北奥多棉吉省协同金边政府军作战。
    该报援引泰国军方一位情报灵通人士的话说，这些目前尚不知人数的越军原属越军302步兵师，后来加入金边政府军286步兵师一起防守三隆县。
    新华社曼谷10月4日电西哈努克民族军总司令诺罗敦·拉那烈王子3日呼吁柬埔寨抵抗力量加紧战斗，粉碎越南和金边政权妄图在柬埔寨制造“既成事实”的阴谋。
    泰国《民族报》今天援引拉那烈王子的话说，这一“既成事实”就是要人们承认越南“撤军”和金边政权已控制局势。
