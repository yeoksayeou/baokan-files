The "One Day of Martial Law" essay contest, initiated by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army and organized by the PLA Literature and Art Publishing House, has successfully concluded during the joyous days of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Over 170 articles, totaling 610,000 words, have been compiled into two volumes by the PLA Literature and Art Publishing House. These volumes record the unforgettable days and nights during the martial law period, providing valuable historical materials for this great struggle and offering vivid, tangible teaching materials for the billion military and civilian personnel. This is indeed a cause for celebration.

Vice Chairman Yang Shangkun pointed out that the PLA's entry into Beijing was unavoidable. The PLA entered the city to maintain social order, ensure the normal functioning of the Party and state organs, and protect the peaceful labor of the people. For a period, many people did not understand this. Through studying Chairman Deng Xiaoping's speeches and the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and through the PLA's actual performance of martial law duties and our propaganda work, misunderstandings have gradually been dispelled. The vast majority of comrades now have a correct understanding of the current struggle. However, the task of completely eliminating misunderstandings, estrangement, and hostile sentiments is far from over. To make the broad masses truly understand the facts, comprehend the Party and government's correct and necessary measures, and unite their thoughts with the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, a great deal of work still needs to be done. This large-scale essay contest aims to convey the true historical picture to the people through the personal experiences and observations of the PLA, armed police, and public security officers who participated in the martial law mission. This not only serves as a good memorial for our heroic martyrs, wounded soldiers, and all members of the martial law forces but also helps the general public, including foreigners, understand the facts and distinguish right from wrong. The practical significance and profound historical value of these essays are self-evident.

At the initial meeting for the essay contest, the leaders of the General Political Department clearly stated: "Every author must have a serious attitude and write truthfully, letting the facts speak for themselves. Only things that conform to historical truth have persuasive power and vitality." (See the "Preface" in *One Day of Martial Law*). This requirement can be considered the important guiding principle for the essays. For historical literature, "historical truth" has always been an important measure of its value. "True is gold and silver, false is dung." To reflect the true face of martial law as much as possible, the organizers of the essay contest have done a great deal of work. The authors of the essays are quite diverse, including generals and soldiers; frontline commanders and medical and logistical support personnel; newly enlisted soldiers and demobilized officers; local department officials, as well as ordinary workers and citizens. Since all the authors are eyewitnesses to the martial law struggle, the authenticity and authority of their writings are almost beyond doubt. This is a collection of eyewitness accounts, free from hearsay. For example, Senior Colonel and Regiment Political Commissar Ji Xinguo's "Negotiations Before the Clearing" truthfully records the process before and after the clearing, using facts to refute some rumors. Driver Lü Jiedong's "Escorting the 'Sniper Platoon' to the Square" vividly describes the situation where the people supported and assisted the troops in completing the martial law mission. Major General and Political Commissar of a certain army group, Wang Fuyi's "Iron Flow Advancing to Tiananmen Square" depicts the arduous advance process of the first echelon entering the square. "Incidents at the Sacred Hall," "Guardians of the Great Hall," "Medical Team to the Great Hall," "Two Bags of Instant Noodles," and others present the arduous life of the troops after entering the square to the readers. From the essays, one can have an overview of the entire martial law operation and understand the different experiences of various units during the advance; one can see the soldiers' endurance and the people's brave rescue efforts; there are both macro descriptions of the whole and specific portrayals of individuals. As a faithful record of martial law, it will forever be inscribed in the annals of the People's Liberation Army.

Martial law itself is a highly policy-oriented task. In a situation where good and bad people are mixed, and there are those who deliberately spread rumors and those who are unaware of the truth, it is very difficult but necessary to firmly execute the superior's orders, severely suppress counter-revolutionary rioters, and at the same time, properly handle policy matters and avoid wronging good people. The essays in "One Day of Martial Law" pay attention to the sense of proportion in the overall policy grasp, adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, and play a role in rectifying the situation and clarifying the facts in some specific incidents. For example, the overall evaluation of the general public and university students is quite appropriate, without malicious defamation, ambiguity, or distortion of facts. The article "Military Weapons! Military Weapons!!" recounts the struggle to rescue military vehicles on June 3, where two university students and one middle school student assisted the PLA soldiers in protecting and rescuing several firearms and ammunition, and obtained a written receipt from the public security and martial law forces' leaders. Later, when they were once arrested as rioters, this receipt played an important role in proving their innocence. This dramatic episode vividly proves that most students are rational and kind-hearted; they do not want to escalate the situation and do not advocate burning cars. Similarly, "Aunt Ma," "Impressions of Beijing People," "Girl, Where Are You?," "96,000 Steamed Buns," and "Everlasting Deep Affection" all truthfully depict the complex psychology of the general public and their selfless support for the soldiers. Facing this severe and complex class struggle, these records make the situation more authentic, profound, and comprehensive.

A plain and unadorned style is another prominent feature of the essays. Most of the articles in "One Day of Martial Law" are narrated from the first-person perspective, with a strong sense of colloquial language, consistent with the authenticity of the content. The language is not embellished or exaggerated; it is mostly a straightforward description of the event process, without irrelevant, cloudy discussions, making the reader feel intimate and down-to-earth, as if a close friend or family member is recounting their experiences. An old comrade who once participated in the editing work of the "Volunteer Army One Day" essay contest sighed after reading these manuscripts, "The cultural level of the current cadres and soldiers has greatly improved compared to the past!" Indeed, from the essays, we can truly feel that the new generation of soldiers not only have high political awareness but also have corresponding knowledge and cultural levels. When they plainly narrate their deepest fighting experiences, they naturally gain extraordinary charm.

Lastly, it is worth mentioning that "One Day of Martial Law" is the crystallization of a large-scale collective creation by the masses. During the essay writing period, which coincided with the summer, the officers and soldiers of the martial law forces wrote seriously under relatively difficult conditions. Many manuscripts were born in damp and hot tents and dusty warehouses. The comrades of the PLA Literature and Art Publishing House also made tremendous efforts for this. From the initiation, organization, to the compilation and publication of the book, it took only two and a half months, which can also be considered a small miracle. The main creators of this miracle are precisely the republic's guardians who fought to the death for the safety of the capital!

　　《戒严一日》征文评介
　　皇甫德仁
    由人民解放军总政治部文化部发起，解放军文艺出版社具体承办的“戒严一日”征文活动在建国40周年的喜庆日子里圆满结束。170余篇记录戒严中难忘的日日夜夜的文章，计61万字，已由解放军文艺出版社分上下册结集出版，为这场伟大的斗争留下了珍贵的史料，也为亿万军民提供了生动的形象化的教材，可喜可贺。
    杨尚昆副主席指出，我军这次进驻北京是迫不得已的，解放军是为了维护社会安宁，保证党和国家机关的正常工作秩序，保护人民的和平劳动而进驻的。一段时间，许多人对此不理解，通过学习邓小平主席的讲话和十三届四中全会精神，通过我军执行戒严任务的实际行动和我们的宣传工作，现在误解已逐步消除，绝大多数同志对当前这场斗争已经有了正确的理解和认识。但还远未达到完全消除误解、隔阂和对立情绪的程度。要使广大群众真正达到了解事情真相，理解党和政府所采取的这一正确、必要的措施，把思想统一到党的十三届四中全会精神上来，还要做大量的工作。这次大规模的征文活动，就是要通过参加执行戒严任务的解放军、武警和公安干警的亲身经历和所见所闻所感，把历史的本来面貌告诉人民。这不仅对我们光荣牺牲的烈士、英勇负伤的官兵和戒严部队的全体同志是个很好的纪念，同时有助于人民群众，包括国外人士了解事实真相，分清是非曲直。征文的现实意义和深远的历史意义都是不言而喻的。
    在征文发起之初的一次会议上，总政领导同志就明确指出：“我们的每一位作者都要有严肃的态度，实事求是地写，用事实说话。只有符合历史真实的东西才有说服力、生命力”。（见《戒严一日》＜代序言＞）可以说，这个要求是征文作品的重要指导方针。对于史传文学，“历史真实”向来就是人们衡量其价值的重要尺度。“真则金玉，假则粪土。”为了尽可能反映戒严的真实面貌，征文的组织者们做了大量的工作，征文的作者相当广泛，有将军，也有士兵；有第一线的指挥员，也有医护人员和后勤保障人员；有刚刚入伍的新战士，也有转业的官兵；有地方各部门的干部，也有普通的工人、市民……由于作者全是亲历了戒严斗争的见证人，因此它的真实性和权威性几乎是勿庸置疑的。这里是目击和经历的集大成，没有道听途说的市场。比如上校团政委季新国的《清场前的谈判》就真实记录了清场的前后经过，用事实驳斥了一些谣言。司机吕敬东的《送“神枪手四连”去广场》则把人民群众支援协助部队完成戒严任务的情况写得颇为动人。某集团军少将政委王福义的《铁流东进天安门》描绘了进入广场第一梯队的艰难开进过程，《圣殿轶事》、《守卫大会堂》、《医疗队开赴人民大会堂》、《两袋方便面》等等把部队进驻广场之后的艰苦生活展现在读者面前……从征文中，既能俯瞰戒严的全貌，又能了解开进中各个部队的不同遭遇；既能看到官兵们的忍辱负重，也能看到人民群众的冒死救援；既有宏观的整体描绘，也有个人的具体刻划。作为戒严的忠实记录，将永远载入人民解放军的史册。
    戒严本身就是一项政策性很强的任务，在好人坏人混杂，蓄意造谣惑众者和不明真相者掺杂的情况下，既坚决执行上级的命令，严厉镇压反革命暴徒，又很好地掌握政策分寸，尽可能不冤枉好人，确实是很难办但又要努力去做的。《戒严一日》的征文，在政策性的总体把握上比较注意分寸感，坚持实事求是的原则，在一些具体事件上，确实起到了正本清源，弄清事实真相的作用。比如对广大市民和大学生的总体评价就比较得当，没有肆意丑化，也没有含糊其辞，更没有歪曲事实。《西单路口军火！军火！！》一文是记叙6月3日抢救军火车辆的斗争的，两名大学生，一名中学生协助解放军战士保护抢救了若干枪枝弹药，并得到公安部门和戒严部队领导签写的字据。日后，他们一度被当成暴徒逮捕时，这字据便起了重要的证明作用。这个颇有戏剧性的情节生动地证明大部分学生还是理智的、善良的，他们并不愿扩大事态，不主张烧汽车。同样，《马嫂》、《北京人印象》、
  《姑娘，你在哪里？》、《九万六千个包子》、《永生难忘的深情》等等也都实事求是地描写了广大市民复杂的心态和对子弟兵的无私支援。面对这场严峻而复杂的阶级斗争，有了这些记录才更显得真切、深刻和全面。
    朴实无华的文风，是征文作品的又一个显著的特点。《戒严一日》中的文章大多从第一人称的角度叙述，口语的语感很强，和内容的真实相一致，文词上也是不粉饰不夸张，大量的是事件过程的如实的白描，而没有不着边际、云天雾罩的议论，使人读来倍感亲切质朴，像是自己的一位亲人、朋友在讲述自己的经历一般。一位当年曾经参加过“志愿军一日”征文的编辑工作的老同志在读了这些文稿之后感叹地说，现在的干部战士文化水平比过去大大地提高了！我们从征文中确实不难感受到新一代军人不仅有较高的政治觉悟，而且有与之相辅相成的知识文化水平。当他们把自己感受最深的斗争经历平白地讲述出来的时候，自然而然地会获得非凡的魅力。
    最后值得一提的是，《戒严一日》是一次大规模的群众性的集体创作的结晶。征文写作之时，正值盛夏，戒严部队的官兵们在比较艰难的条件下认真写作，许多文稿是在潮湿闷热的帐篷里，在尘土飞扬的库房中诞生的。解放军文艺出版社的同志们也为此付出了巨大的努力，征文从发起、组织到结集成书出版，前后总共才两个多月的时间，也可以说是一个不小的奇迹。而奇迹的主要创作者，正是那些为了首都的安危而浴血奋斗的共和国的卫士们！
