The tenth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress was held this afternoon, during which several members spoke on related bills under discussion.

Wan Li, the Chairman, attended the meeting, and Hab Zongxun, the Vice Chairman, presided over the meeting.

The meeting first heard a report from Song Ruwei, the Vice Chairman of the Law Committee, on several amendments to the draft of the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law, and the draft of the Urban Residents' Committee Organization Law.

Commissioner Yang Jike, in his speech titled "We Must Promote Ecological Agriculture to Complement Environmental Protection," said that environmental issues are a crisis facing humanity today. In China, preventing environmental pollution and maintaining ecological balance are fundamental national policies. However, some people still mistakenly believe that ecological damage only occurs in capitalist countries because their production is profit-driven and reckless. While we are a socialist country, our production is for the benefit of humanity, so we will not cause ecological damage. This view is very one-sided. Ecological balance is a natural phenomenon, and even in a socialist country, if natural laws are violated, we will still be punished. We must not repeat the mistakes made 20 years ago regarding population issues. After listing some figures on "three wastes" pollution in Anhui Province, he said that China's work on natural conservation and ecological agriculture is urgent and must be done. To accomplish this, in addition to adding a chapter on "ecological agriculture" to China's environmental protection law, we must also strengthen the propaganda and education on the economic issues of ecological agriculture, so that everyone knows that protecting nature and improving the ecological environment is everyone's responsibility, especially the leaders at all levels.

Commissioner Wang Houde said that the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Supervision have done a lot of work in the fight against corruption and the punishment of bribery, achieving initial results, which should be fully affirmed. However, we should not overestimate the situation; the problem is still serious, and the struggle is still arduous. Some deeply hidden cases have not been uncovered, and there is still great resistance in handling some major cases. The situation of rectifying companies, especially large companies, is not fully clear, and the legal responsibilities of relevant personnel for violations of the law still need to be pursued, etc. It is suggested to continue to grasp both aspects, resolutely act according to law, solve the problem of "fining instead of sentencing," and at the same time, the state should support the work of judicial, procuratorial, and supervisory organs in terms of financial and material resources.

Commissioner Li Chonghui, in his speech titled "On the Problems Existing in the Current Bidding in China and Legislative Suggestions," said that China's bidding work is a product of reform and a new phenomenon under the socialist planned commodity economy, and its significance should not be underestimated. However, the current problem is: there is no national unified leadership organization, bidding is not legislated, there are no rules to follow, bidding organizations are numerous and chaotic, and lack authority, etc. In order to strengthen macro-control, cooperate with the rectification and adjustment, and ensure that economic construction runs on the track of the rule of law, it is suggested: to put the bidding work of the whole country under the unified jurisdiction of the State Planning Commission, and to formulate bidding and tendering legal documents and preferential policies for winning bids as soon as possible.

Commissioner Liu Yandong said in her speech that for the sake of the country, the nation, and the future of socialism, the whole party and society should reach a consensus on cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, and with a passionate and demanding attitude, fully understand and correctly treat young people. We must clearly recognize that today's youth bear the historical mission of China's socialist modernization. Therefore, no matter what storms we encounter, we will not shake our party's flesh-and-blood connection with the youth, nor will we shake our party's trust in the younger generation. To this end, she suggested: to make cultivating "four-haves" successors a basic national policy, to give full play to the leading role of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the Young Pioneers, and to create a good social environment for the healthy growth of the younger generation.

Other speakers included Wu Dakun, Yang Lieyu, and Tao Dazong, who spoke on behalf of Qian Min. They expressed their opinions on China's foreign propaganda work, the strategic deployment of urban overall planning, etc.

In the previous group meetings, the commissioners also reviewed the report on the handling of the bills submitted by the representatives to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress by the six special committees of the National People's Congress, and believed that the special committees had handled the bills seriously and responsibly, and they were satisfied with this.

Vice Chairmen Peng Chong, Apuo Awang Jinmei, Yan Jizi, Rong Yiren, Ye Fei, Liao Hansheng, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, and Wang Hanbin attended the meeting.

State Councilor Song Jian was present at the meeting.

　　人大常委会第十次会议进行大会发言
　　一些委员就有关议案发表意见
    新华社北京10月30日电　七届全国人大常委会第十次会议今天下午进行大会发言，一些委员就本次会议审议的有关议案发表意见。
    万里委员长出席会议，习仲勋副委员长主持会议。
    会议首先听取了法律委员会副主任委员宋汝棼作的关于集会游行示威法草案修改稿和城市居民委员会组织法草案修改稿几点修改意见的汇报。
    杨纪珂委员在题为《必须提倡生态农业，使之与环境保护相辅相成》的发言中说，环境问题是当前人类面临的一个危机。从我国情况看，防止环境污染，维护生态平衡，是我们的一项基本国策。但有些同志至今错误地认为，环境生态破坏，只有在资本主义国家才发生，因为他们的生产唯利是图，不计后果。而我们是社会主义国家，生产是为人类谋福利的，因而不会造成环境生态破坏。这种认识是非常片面的。生态平衡是一种自然现象，即使是社会主义国家，如果违反了自然规律，同样会受到惩罚。我们对环境问题的认识，决不能像20多年前对人口问题那样，再犯错误了。他在列举了安徽省“三废”污染的一些数字后说，我国的自然保护和生态农业工作应是迫在眉睫，势在必行了。要做好这些工作，除了在我国的环保法中增加“生态农业”一章外，还必须加强对生态农业经济问题的宣传教育工作，使大家都知道保护自然、改善生态环境人人有责，尤其重要的是提高各级领导干部的认识。
    王厚德委员说，两高一部在反腐败和惩治贪污受贿斗争中做了大量工作，取得了初步成效，应该充分肯定。但对此不能估计过高，问题还很严重，斗争还很艰巨，有些隐藏很深的案件还没有挖出来，有些大案要案的处理阻力还很大。整顿公司特别是大公司的情况并未完全清楚，对有关人员违法的法律责任还有待追究等等。建议继续坚持两手抓，坚决依法办事，解决“以罚代刑”问题，同时，国家对审判、检察、监察机关的工作从财力、物力上给予支持。
    李崇淮委员在题为《关于我国当前招标存在的问题及立法的建议》的发言中说，我国的招标工作是改革的产物，是社会主义有计划商品经济条件下的一个新现象，意义不可低估。但现在的问题是：缺乏全国统一领导机构，招标未立法、无章可循，招标机构多且乱、缺乏权威性等。为了加强宏观控制，配合治理整顿，保证经济建设在法制轨道上运行，建议：把全国招标工作纳入国家计委统一管辖下，迅速制定招标投标法律文件及中标企业的优惠政策。
    刘延东委员在发言中说，为国家、民族和社会主义前途计，全党全社会要确立起培养无产阶级革命事业接班人这一共识，以热情爱护、严格要求的态度全面认识、正确对待青年。我们要清醒地认识到，今天的青年肩负着中国社会主义现代化的历史重任。因此，无论遇到任何风浪也动摇不了我们党与青年的血肉联系，动摇不了党对青年一代的信赖。为此，她建议：把培养“四有”接班人作为我们的一项基本国策，充分发挥共青团、青联、学联、少先队等青少年组织的主导作用，为青少年一代健康成长创造良好的社会环境。
    在会上发言的还有：吴大琨、杨烈宇，陶大镛委员代表钱敏委员作联合发言。他们就我国对外宣传工作、城市总体规划的战略部署等发表了意见。
    在前几天的分组会上，委员们还审议了全国人大六个专门委员会关于七届全国人大二次会议主席团交付审议的代表提出的议案审议结果的报告，认为各专门委员会对议案的处理是认真负责的，他们对此表示满意。
    副委员长彭冲、阿沛·阿旺晋美、严济慈、荣毅仁、叶飞、廖汉生、倪志福、陈慕华、费孝通、孙起孟、雷洁琼、王汉斌，出席了会议。
    国务委员宋健列席了会议。
