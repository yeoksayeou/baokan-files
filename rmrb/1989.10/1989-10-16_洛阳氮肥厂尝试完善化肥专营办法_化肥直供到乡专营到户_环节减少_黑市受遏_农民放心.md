Luoyang Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, with the close cooperation of local governments at various levels, has been implementing a method of direct fertilizer supply to townships and monopoly sales to households since the beginning of this year. This approach has addressed the issues of excessive circulation links and illegal resale in fertilizer distribution, making it a positive attempt to improve the fertilizer monopoly system.

Luoyang Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant is a medium-sized enterprise producing nearly 200,000 tons of ammonium carbonate annually. To reduce intermediate links, alleviate the burden on farmers, and boost their enthusiasm for grain production, the plant, with the approval of relevant provincial and municipal departments, began implementing the "direct supply to townships and monopoly sales to households" method for three counties and two districts nearby this year. The quantity of directly supplied fertilizer is allocated by the municipal direct supply leading group to counties and districts. Townships then commission local supply and marketing cooperatives to sign purchase and sales contracts with the fertilizer plant and issue certificates to households. The supplied fertilizer is allocated monthly in a ratio of "30% in the off-season and 70% in the peak season," with a deposit required to the fertilizer plant. The deposit is 2 yuan per bag in the off-season and 4 yuan in the peak season. Each township or local supply and marketing cooperative retrieves the fertilizer from the plant according to the monthly allocation. If the receiving party fails to retrieve the fertilizer within the specified time, the plant does not refund the deposit or supply additional fertilizer. If the plant fails to supply the fertilizer on time, it is penalized double the deposit amount, refunding 4 yuan per bag in the off-season and 8 yuan per bag in the peak season.

This method of direct fertilizer supply to townships and monopoly sales to households has the following advantages:

- It reduces intermediate links, eliminates black-market transactions, and stabilizes the fertilizer market. Previously, due to layer upon layer of price increases, the fertilizer price issue was prominent. Last September, the average selling price of ammonium carbonate per ton in the province was 120 yuan higher than the factory price, and the market order was chaotic, with incidents of intercepting and looting fertilizer occurring frequently. After implementing the direct supply method to townships, the supply and demand meet directly, stabilizing and slightly reducing fertilizer prices. Despite the increase of 37 yuan per ton in fertilizer cost this year, farmers are purchasing fertilizer at an average of 40 yuan less per ton compared to last year.

- It motivates fertilizer production enterprises, with monthly and seasonal supply of fertilizer benefiting the balanced production of the fertilizer plant. It is understood that after the plant signs contracts with townships or local supply and marketing cooperatives, farmers pay deposits in advance, totaling over 400 million yuan, which has eased the plant's financial difficulties. At the same time, if the plant fails to supply fertilizer on time, it is penalized double the deposit amount, forcing the plant to produce more fertilizer. After implementing direct supply and demand, intermediate links are reduced, and the loss rate decreases. This alone has earned Luoyang Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant over 6 million yuan from January to September. They have used this fund for technological upgrades, expanding production capacity. Meanwhile, according to the contract, the factory implements price differences between the off-season and peak season, supplying fertilizer to local supply and marketing cooperatives on time each month, ensuring balanced production.

- It relieves the burden on officials and reassures farmers, solving the "voucher fertilizer" problem. Officials from Luoyang Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant and Yiyang County told reporters that this year, no one came to leaders for vouchers, allowing the factory manager to focus on production. County, township, and supply and marketing cooperatives no longer worry about fertilizer "backdoor" deals.

    洛阳氮肥厂尝试完善化肥专营办法
    化肥直供到乡专营到户
    环节减少　黑市受遏　农民放心
    本报洛阳10月14日电　记者李杰报道：河南省洛阳氮肥厂在当地各级政府密切配合下，从今年初开始实行化肥直供到乡、专营到户的办法，解决了化肥经营中存在的流通环节过多和非法倒卖问题，堪称完善化肥专营的一种积极尝试。
    洛阳氮肥厂是个年产近20万吨碳酸铵的中型企业。为减少中间环节，减轻农民负担，调动农民种粮的积极性，经省、市有关部门同意，该厂今年初开始对邻近的3县2区实行化肥“直供到乡、专营到户”。直供化肥数量由市直供领导小组分配指标到县区，各乡委托基层供销社同化肥厂签订购销合同，发证到户。所供化肥按“淡三旺七”的比例逐月分配，并要向化肥厂交纳定金，淡季每袋2元，旺季4元。各乡或基层供销社根据每月分配数及时到厂提取化肥，如需方不能按合同规定的时间提货，厂方既不退定金，也不再补供化肥；如厂方不按时供肥，按定金数加倍处罚，淡季每袋退4元，旺季每袋退8元。
    这种化肥直供到乡、专营到户的专营办法有以下好处：
    ——减少了中间环节，取缔了黑市交易，稳定了化肥市场。过去由于层层加价，化肥价格问题十分突出。去年9月，全省碳酸铵每吨平均售价比出厂价高120元，而且市场秩序混乱，拦路哄抢化肥的现象时有发生。实行化肥直供到乡的办法后，产需直接见面，化肥价格稳中有降。尽管今年化肥每吨成本增加37元，但直供专营后农民买到的化肥比去年平均每吨还低40元。
    ——调动了化肥生产企业的积极性，按月按季供肥，有利于化肥厂均衡生产。据了解，化肥厂与乡或基层供销社签订合同后，农民提前交预付定金，仅此一项厂方就收定金400多万元，缓解了资金紧张的困难。同时，厂方如不能按时供肥，对厂方加倍惩罚，迫使厂方千方百计多产化肥。实行产需直接见面后，减少了中间环节，差率下降。仅此一项洛阳氮肥厂1—9月就多得60余万元。他们将此项资金用于技改，扩大了生产能力。同时，按合同规定，工厂执行淡旺季差价，按月把化肥及时供给基层供销社，保证了均衡生产。
    ——干部省心，农民放心，“条子肥”问题解决了。洛阳氮肥厂的同志和宜阳县的领导告诉记者，今年没人找领导批条子，厂长可以集中精力抓生产。县乡和供销社再也不为化肥走“后门”发愁了。
