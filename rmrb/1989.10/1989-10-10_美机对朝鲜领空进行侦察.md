U.S. aircraft conducts reconnaissance over North Korean airspace

According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency, a U.S. U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft flew over North Korean airspace on the morning of the 9th, traversing from the West Sea near the military demarcation line to the East Sea, conducting aerial reconnaissance over North Korea. Similar reconnaissance activities have occurred nine times this month alone.

The report states that while the United States is conducting the "RIMPAC 89" joint military exercises around Japan, it has continuously conducted aerial reconnaissance over North Korea, further exposing the hypocrisy of the United States' so-called "easing of tensions" and "creating a atmosphere of trust."

    美机对朝鲜领空进行侦察
    据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，美国U—2高空侦察机一架，九日上午从朝鲜西海上空沿军事分界线至朝鲜东海上空飞行，对朝鲜北方进行空中侦察。类似这样的侦察活动，仅十月份就达九次。
    报道说，美国在日本周围海上举行代号为“环太平洋八九”联合军事演习的同时，不断对朝鲜北方进行空中侦察，进一步暴露了美国所谓的“缓和紧张局势”、“创造信任气氛”的虚伪性。
