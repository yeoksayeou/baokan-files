Title: We Must Have a "Comprehensive Transportation" Mindset

To develop China's transportation system, we must adopt a comprehensive transportation mindset, which is essentially the issue of a comprehensive transportation system. This issue has not been fully resolved, especially between the railway and highway departments. There is still a lack of consensus on how to develop comprehensive transportation. The railway department emphasizes the primacy of railways. The highway department argues that while railways are the senior, highways and waterways should also develop. We are pursuing comprehensive transportation, which requires coordinated development. It is not about who is the senior or junior; each industry should have its own place. Given our country's situation, we should adhere to the principle of using waterways where appropriate, railways where appropriate, and highways where appropriate, allowing each mode of transportation to play to its strengths. Currently, all modes of transportation in our country are weak and need development. There is no question of restricting any one mode.

To further develop transportation, the state must provide supportive policies.

The State Planning Commission's previous proposal for an energy and transportation fund was good, but due to the state's financial constraints, the fund was used to supplement the fiscal budget. Now, there is strong opposition to this, with people asking why the energy and transportation sectors, which are so weak, should have their funds taken and not used for energy and transportation development.

Additionally, regarding land use tax, there are also significant objections. However, from the perspective of agriculture, this is a major source of funds for agricultural infrastructure. If everyone is exempted, there will be nothing left. To develop China's transportation system, these issues need further study.

We hope that relevant departments will assist the State Planning Commission in studying how to develop transportation and provide specific, operable suggestions.

### 要有“大交通”观念

　　要有“大交通”观念
　　国家计委工业一司副司长  李端绅
    发展我国的交通运输要树立大交通的观念，也就是综合运输体系问题。这个问题不是现在都解决了。特别是在铁路和公路这两个部门，对怎样发展综合交通，认识还不很一致。铁路部门强调以铁路为主。公路部门认为，老铁是老大，我们公路和水运也要发展。我们是搞综合交通运输，要协调发展，不是谁老大、老二的问题，每一种行业，都应该有一定的位置。根据我们国家的情况，还是要坚持宜水则水，宜铁则铁，宜路则路的方针，各种交通工具发挥自己的优势。我们现在的交通运输都很薄弱，都要发展，不存在限制谁的问题。
    要使交通运输得到进一步发展，国家必须给予优惠的政策支持。
    计委前几年搞能源交通基金的设想是好的，但是由于国家财政紧缺，把能源交通基金作为财政补充。现在大家对此反应强烈，说能源交通部门这么薄弱，为什么收了我们的钱，反而不用于搞能源交通。
    另外，在税收方面，大家对土地占用税，也是意见比较大。但是从农业口来看，这是农业基本建设资金的一个主要来源。你也免，我也免，免到最后就没有东西了。要发展我国交通运输，这些问题都需要进一步研究。
    希望有关部门帮助计委在具体研究交通运输如何发展上，提出一些具体的、可操作性的意见。
