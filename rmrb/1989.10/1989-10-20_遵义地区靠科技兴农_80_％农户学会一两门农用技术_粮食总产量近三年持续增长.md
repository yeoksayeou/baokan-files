The idea of promoting agricultural development through science and technology has taken root among the farmers in the remote and underdeveloped northern part of Guizhou Province. Recently, reporters from this newspaper learned from the Zunyi Regional Committee and Administrative Office that the region currently has 4,034 demonstration households for science and technology, with over 80% of the total households mastering one or two applicable agricultural technologies. More than 60% of the arable land is cultivated using scientific techniques.

Known as the "granary of northern Guizhou," the Zunyi region found that while the introduction of the market mechanism in rural areas had led to the development of commodity production and increased farmers' income, grain production had declined, thus constraining overall economic development. To address this, the Regional Committee and Administrative Office concluded that in developing the rural economy, it was necessary to accelerate grain production. To achieve this, in addition to policies and investments, the region had to rely on scientific and technological advancements to improve farmers' scientific farming skills. In the spring of 1986, based on in-depth investigations and the local conditions, the Zunyi Regional Committee and Administrative Office began promoting five applicable agricultural technologies across the region: hybrid seeds, two-stage rice seedling cultivation, semi-dryland cultivation for rusty and rotten fields, dryland strip rotation for three-crop system, and film mulching and seedling transplantation.

Over the years, in addition to providing substantial financial support to farmers, the region has mobilized and encouraged tens of thousands of agricultural scientists to go to the countryside to spread agricultural knowledge and provide technical guidance in the fields. Simultaneously, the region has organized tens of thousands of agricultural science and technology training sessions, training over 1.76 million farmers, and established a large number of farmer science and technology demonstration households. Today, the five applicable agricultural technologies have deeply taken root in the rural areas of the region.

In the past three years, despite a reduction of 440,000 mu of arable land and a net increase of 280,000 people in the agricultural population, coupled with severe disasters each year, the total grain production in the Zunyi region has still increased by an average of 4% annually.

    遵义地区靠科技兴农
    80％农户学会一两门农用技术
    粮食总产量近三年持续增长
    本报贵阳10月19日电　记者潘帝都、胡跃平报道：科技兴农的思想已在偏远落后的黔北山区广大农民中扎下了根。日前，记者从遵义地委、行署获悉，这个地区农村目前已有科技示范户4034户，掌握1至2项农业适用技术的农户占总农户的80％以上，60％以上的耕地采用科学技术耕作。
    素有“黔北粮仓”之称的遵义地区，当农村改革进入第二步时，地委、行署发现，农村引入市场机制后，商品生产虽然发展了，农民收入增加了，但粮食生产却下降了，制约了整个经济发展。为此，地委、行署认为，在发展农村商品经济中，必须加快粮食生产的发展。而要使两项生产都加快，除靠政策和投入外，只能依靠科学技术，提高农民科学种田水平。1986年春，遵义地委、行署在深入调查研究的基础上，根据本地实际，开始在全区农村推广了杂交良种、水稻两段育秧、冷烂锈田半旱式栽培、旱地分带轮作三熟制、地膜覆盖和育苗移栽等五项农业适用科学技术。
    几年来，这个地区除了在资金上给予农民大力扶持外，先后动员和鼓励了数以万计农科人员坚持下乡传播农科知识，深入田间地头技术指导，和农民一起推广运用5项农业适用科学技术。同时，全区还先后举办了上万期各种农业科技培训班，培训农民176万多人次，建立了一大批农民科技示范户。如今，5项农业适用科学技术已在全区农村深深扎下了根。
    近3年来，遵义地区尽管耕地面积减少44万亩，农业人口净增28万人，连年遭受严重灾害，但全区粮食总产年均仍以4％的速度增长。
