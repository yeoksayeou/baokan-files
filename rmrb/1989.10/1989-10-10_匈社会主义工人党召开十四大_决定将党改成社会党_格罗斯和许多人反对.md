The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held its 14th (Extraordinary) Congress here today.

This congress, convened ahead of schedule, was attended by 1,276 delegates representing 720,000 party members.

Since the party's national congress in May last year, Hungary's political situation has undergone significant changes. The country has transitioned to a "multi-party system," political factions within the party have emerged, and disagreements among party leaders have become public. Some political factions within the party criticize the party's current policies, accusing the leadership of "leading the country away from the socialist path"; while those advocating for "thorough reform" claim they will "eliminate conservatives" and announce that if their proposals are not accepted at the congress, they will leave the party.

According to the decision, this congress broke with tradition by not setting an agenda in advance. After a lengthy debate on the agenda, party chairman Nersh Reje addressed the congress. He believed that Hungary now "needs a new type of party," and the new party should "simultaneously inherit the traditions and values of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party." He advocated that the party should strive to establish a "democratic socialist order."

When party general secretary Gross Karoy supplemented his written report on the work of the central committee, he also expressed his support for "building democratic socialism" as the party's goal. He also advocated for a conciliatory attitude towards different opinions and factions within the party.

Party leader and member of the presidium, Pozhigai Yimulai, advocated for the establishment of a new party. He believed that this new party should be organized based on the values of the "European left" and the requirements of "democratic socialism," and the new party could be called the "Hungarian Socialist Party."

On the eve of the congress, the "Marxist Unified Program Group" within the Hungarian party published its program in the October 5 issue of the "People's Freedom Newspaper." The program accused "domestic and foreign reactionary forces hoping to transform into capitalism" of attacking the socialist system. The program criticized some party members for "restoring capitalism under the guise of 'democratic socialism'" and accused them of "dismantling the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party" and intending to "transform the Hungarian party into a Western-style Social Democratic Party." The program called on the congress delegates to "defend the communist nature of the party representing the interests of the working class, peasants, and all laborers."

The congress began discussions on the party's future goals and nature today. The congress is scheduled to last four days.

The ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party decided to transform itself into the Hungarian Socialist Party.

This decision was made at the 7th session of the party's 14th (Extraordinary) Congress. The congress passed a resolution titled "The Congress on the Position of the Hungarian Socialist Party," stating that the era marked by the name "Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party" has "ended."

The resolution stated that the Hungarian Socialist Party supports the establishment of a "multi-party parliamentary democracy based on a mixed economic ownership system, social market economy, and autonomous system."

According to this document, members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party must hold branch meetings for registration before October 31 this year. Those who sign to acknowledge the party constitution and charter of the Hungarian Socialist Party can become members of the new party.

Party chairman Nersh said today at the congress that the new party should break with the way of proletarian dictatorship and its ideology, break with the remnants of democratic centralism, and break with class policy.

Party presidium member Pozhigai Yimulai said at a press conference this afternoon that the new party will join the Socialist International.

However, this decision by the party congress also faced opposition from some delegates, including certain leaders.

Former politburo member and current chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the national assembly, Bayelai Jiannuo, representing the "Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Unity and Reform Movement," emphasized at the congress on the 7th that he would maintain his communist identity no matter what, and he could only join a party that provided him with this possibility.

The decision by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Congress to transform into the Hungarian Socialist Party on the 7th has sparked strong reactions within the party. The congress spokesperson, Baolabaosh, said at a press conference tonight: "After the decision to establish the Hungarian Socialist Party on Saturday, many people wrote letters, made phone calls, or sent telegrams to the congress, expressing angry protests."

Meanwhile, some leaders and factions within the party have also expressed different opinions on the transformation into a new party.

Party general secretary Gross said in an interview with reporters today that he "cannot accept this decision." He said he did not want to be a member of the Hungarian Socialist Party and did not want to establish a new party.

He believed that "the Hungarian political stage needs a left-wing movement with Marxist ideological values."

Former politburo member and chairman of the "Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Unity and Reform Group," Bayelai, said: "We remain in the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, and I hope most party members will do the same."

The "Kadala Yinuoshu Hui" within the Hungarian party publicly announced in a letter to the Hungarian News Agency that they would establish the Hungarian Communist Party. The chairman of the "Marxist Unified Program Group," Libansiji, said at the congress news center tonight to domestic and foreign reporters that he believed the new party established yesterday was "a major setback in the history of the Hungarian revolutionary movement and the workers' movement."

    匈社会主义工人党召开十四大
    决定将党改成社会党　格罗斯和许多人反对
    新华社布达佩斯10月6日电　（记者侯凤菁、邹国昌）匈牙利社会主义工人党第十四次（非常）代表大会今天在这里开幕。
    这次提前召开的党代会共有1276名代表参加，他们代表72万党员。
    自去年5月匈党全国代表会议以来，匈牙利政局发生了很大变化。国家向“多党制”过渡，党内政治派别纷起，党的领导人之间意见分歧公开化。党内有的政治派别批评党的现行政策，指责党的领导“使国家脱离了社会主义道路”；而主张“彻底改革”的派别则声称要“清除保守分子”并宣布自己的主张如不能在党代会上取胜便要退党。
    根据决定，这次党代会打破了常规，事先不确定议程。代表们在会上对议程进行了长时间的争论后，党的主席涅尔什·雷热向大会致开幕词。他认为，现在匈牙利“需要一个新型的党”，新的党应该“同时继承社会民主党和共产党的传统与价值”。他主张，党为建立“民主社会主义的秩序”而努力。
    匈党总书记格罗斯·卡罗伊就党中央工作的书面报告作补充发言时，也表示主张以“建设民主社会主义”作为党的目标。他还主张对党内不同的观点和派别采取调和的态度。
    党内主张“彻底改革”的代表人物、主席团委员波日高伊·伊姆雷在发言中主张建立新党。他认为，这个新党要根据“欧洲左派”的价值观和“民主社会主义”的要求进行组织建设，新党可称为“匈牙利社会党”。
    在党代会召开前夕，匈党内的“马克思主义统一纲领派”在5日出版的《人民自由报》上公布了自己的纲领。纲领指责“希望向资本主义转化的国内外反动势力向社会主义制度展开进攻”。纲领批评党内一些人“在‘民主社会主义’口号的掩盖下开始恢复资本主义”，还指责这些人“瓦解匈牙利社会主义工人党”，要把匈党“改变成为西方式的社会民主党”。纲领号召党代会的代表“捍卫党代表工人阶级、农民和所有劳动者利益的共产主义性质”。
    党代会今天已开始就党今后的目标和性质展开讨论。党代会预定举行四天。
    新华社布达佩斯10月7日电　（记者侯凤菁、邹国昌）执政的匈牙利社会主义工人党决定将该党改建成为匈牙利社会党。
    这一决定是在匈党第十四次（非常）代表大会7日会议上作出的。党代会通过的题为《代表大会关于匈牙利社会党的立场》的决议说，以匈牙利社会主义工人党的名称为标志的时代“已经结束”。
    决议说，匈牙利社会党支持建立“以混合的经济所有制、社会市场经济和自治体制为基础的多党议会民主”。
    根据这个文件的规定，匈牙利社会主义工人党的党员在今年10月31日前要召开支部大会进行登记，凡签名表示承认匈牙利社会党的党纲、党章者均可转为该党党员。
    匈党主席涅尔什今天在大会上讲话时说，新党应同无产阶级专政方式及其思想决裂、同民主集中制残余决裂，同阶级政策决裂。
    党中央主席团委员波日高伊·伊姆雷在7日下午的记者招待会上说，新党将参加社会国际。
    但匈党代表大会的这一决定也遭到一些代表、包括某些领导人的反对。
    匈党前政治局委员、现国会外交委员会主席拜赖茨·亚诺什代表“匈牙利社会主义工人党团结革新运动”在7日的大会上发言时强调，他无论如何也要维护自己共产党人的本质，他要参加的只能是能给他提供这种可能的党。
    新华社布达佩斯10月8日电　（记者邹国昌）匈牙利社会主义工人党代表大会7日通过将党改建成为匈牙利社会党的决议，在党内引起强烈反响。党代会发言人鲍劳巴什今晚在记者招待会说：“星期六决定成立匈牙利社会党后，有许多人给代表大会写信、打电话或打电报，表示愤怒的抗议。”
    与此同时，一些领导人和党内一些派别也对改建成新党发表了不同意见。
    匈党总书记格罗斯今天向记者发表谈话，表示对这一决定“无法接受”。他说，他不想成为匈牙利社会党的党员，也不想建立新党。
    他认为，“在匈牙利政治舞台上，需要一个具有马克思主义思想价值观的左派运动。”
    匈党前政治局委员、“匈牙利社会主义工人党团结革新派”主席拜赖茨说：“我们仍留在匈牙利社会主义工人党内，我希望大部分党员也这样做。”
    匈党内的“卡达尔·亚诺什协会”在给匈通社的信中公开宣布要组建匈牙利共产党。“马克思主义统一纲领派”的主席里班斯基今晚在大会新闻中心向国内外记者发表谈话，认为昨天成立的新党是“匈牙利革命运动和工人运动史上的一大倒退。”
