    Upholding Justice in Law Enforcement
    —A Chronicle of the Construction of a Clean Government in the Chaoyang District Industrial and Commercial Bureau of Beijing

    By Reporter Zhao Xinglin

    The comprehensive management of the Chaoyang District market in Beijing has achieved a significant turnaround. In the first half of this year, it participated in the evaluation competition of eight urban and suburban districts in the city and jumped from the last place in the previous year to the second place. This change is closely related to the district's industrial and commercial bureau's strict enforcement of laws and emphasis on building a clean government.

    As the saying goes, "To correct others, one must first correct oneself." The key to maintaining a good atmosphere is to regulate the team. The Chaoyang District Industrial and Commercial Bureau first publicized the procedures and standards for market management, individual management, and the fight against economic crimes within its jurisdiction. At the same time, it appointed 41 part-time inspectors within the bureau system and hired 30 supervisors from various sectors of society. To strengthen the construction of the staff team and eliminate corrupt elements, since last year, 5 heads of industrial and commercial offices have been removed from their posts, 4 officials who accepted bribes have been sentenced or dismissed from public office, and 8 staff members with minor economic problems have been transferred from their original positions.

    Because the Chaoyang District Industrial and Commercial Bureau has taken the construction of a clean government seriously, the old saying "punish the guilty but not those who give gifts" has become ineffective here. In March of last year, an individual merchant was caught selling 77 packs of Hilton cigarettes. This individual repeatedly asked relevant leaders to intervene. Some leaders found Yang Qingfeng of the Market Management Department and asked him to "be lenient." However, Yang Qingfeng remained unmoved and insisted on handling the matter according to regulations, confiscating the cigarettes sold by the individual and imposing a fine of 300 yuan.

    Ma Changli, the head of the Supervision Department of the bureau, told the reporter that their bureau has a Business Department that deals with more than 13,000 enterprises, and in recent years, they have not received a single letter or call of complaint from the enterprises. He casually opened the registry of refusing meals, bribes, and gifts, and the reporter saw that 313 instances had been recorded in the first half of this year, including 15,972 yuan in cash, as well as a considerable number of cigarettes, liquor, jade necklaces, watches, high-end cameras, electronic lighters, beverages, and fruits.

    The leading officials in the bureau set an example, and the grassroots comrades had a model to follow. In the office of the Jingsong Industrial and Commercial Office, a bright red handbag caught the eye. Lin Zhong, the head of the office, said that someone had sent it early in the morning, and they were looking for the person who sent the gift. He opened the zipper of the handbag, revealing two bottles of Xifeng liquor and a pack of Hilton cigarettes.

    The head of the office had a lot to say, "Some individual merchants, in order to gain illegal profits, often use their money to buy our power to make more money. Whether we can resist the temptation of money, this is a severe test for us industrial and commercial management personnel."

    The market on Xiushui East Street, known as "OK Street," attracts many foreign tourists every day with its colorful and trendy clothing. The co-managers of this market are seven retired military personnel selected by the street committee. These "old soldiers" with graying hair have set three rules for themselves: do not eat, buy, or take the goods from the stalls here. Some have even given up their long-standing habit of smoking.

    "Actions speak louder than words." The management of "OK Street" is in excellent order. In the past two years, the market management personnel have picked up more than 50,000 yuan in cash, as well as gold necklaces, gold watches, and clothing. Whenever the owners reclaim their lost money and items, "OK, OK" can be heard repeatedly.

    风正好执法
    ——北京朝阳区工商局廉政建设纪事
    本报记者　赵兴林
    北京市朝阳区综合治理集贸市场打了个翻身仗。今年上半年参加全市8个城近郊区评比竞赛，所得分数由去年的倒数第一跃为第二名。出现这一变化，与区工商局严格执法、注重抓廉政建设是分不开的。
    常言道，正人先正己，风正好执法。风气正，关键是理顺队伍。朝阳区工商局首先把本职范围内的市场管理、个体管理以及打击经济违法等项工作程序及要达到的标准，公布于众。同时，还在局系统内设41名兼职监察员，从社会各方聘请30名监督员。为了加强职工队伍建设，清除腐败分子，自去年至今，已有5名工商所负责人被撤职，4名收受贿赂的干部被依法判刑或被开除公职，8名犯有轻度经济问题的工作人员被调离原工作岗位。
    由于朝阳区工商局认真抓廉政建设，“打人不打送礼的”这一古训在这里失灵了。去年3月，有位个体商贩倒卖77条希尔顿香烟被查获，这位个体户先后多次请有关领导干部说情。有的领导干部找到市场科杨庆丰同志，让他“通融通融”。但杨庆丰不为所动，坚持按规定办事，将那位个体户倒卖的香烟如数作价收购，并罚款300元。
    朝阳区工商局监察科长马长立告诉记者，他们局有与13000多家企业打交道的企业科，近年来还未收到来自企业的一件举报信、举报电话。他随手打开拒吃请、受贿，拒收礼品的登记簿，记者看到，今年上半年已有313人次记录在册，其中拒收现金15972元，还有数量可观的香烟、名酒、玛瑙项链、手表、高级照相机、电子打火机以及饮料、水果等。
    局机关干部以身作则，基层的同志就有了榜样。在劲松工商所办公室，一个鲜红色手提包惹人注目。薄宗林所长说，这是有人一大早送来的，他们正在查找送礼者。他打开提包拉锁，内装两瓶西凤酒和一条希尔顿香烟。
    这位所长颇有感触地说，有些个体户，为了获得非法之财，往往用他们手中的钱，买我们手中的权，以赚取更多的钱。能否经得住金钱的诱惑，这对我们工商管理人员是一个严峻的考验。
    被称之为“OK”街的秀水东街集贸市场，五颜六色的新潮时装，每天都吸引来众多的外国游客。管理这个市场的协管员，却是由街道选聘的7名军队离退休干部。这几位鬓发染霜的“老八路”，对自己约法三章：不吃、不买、不拿这儿摊商的商品。有的还戒掉了多年抽香烟的嗜好。
    身教重于言教。“OK”街管理得井井有条。近两年，这个市场管理人员共拾现金5万多元，还有金项链、金表和衣物等。每当失主认领失而复得的钱、物时，“OK，OK”不绝于口。
