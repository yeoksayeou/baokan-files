	Du Yujie took office as the head of the Forestry Bureau in Zhouzhi County in early 1987. Soon after assuming his position, he took advantage of his authority to illegally fell and steal timber. Simultaneously, he engaged in large-scale, unlicensed purchases of timber illegally felled by others in the forestry area, transporting it out of the mountains and selling it for personal gain. He disregarded the state's mandatory timber felling quota, increasing the timber felling quota by over 360 cubic meters on his own in 1987 alone. Under his influence, illegal felling and stealing of timber became rampant in Zhouzhi County. In just seven months as the head of the Forestry Bureau, Du Yujie built a two-story house with a basement in the county seat, covering an area of over 230 square meters.

	After Du Yujie's illegal activities were exposed by local forestry officials and the public, the Zhouzhi County Party Committee and the county government, under the supervision of higher authorities, removed him from his position as the head of the Forestry Bureau. However, they appointed him as the head of the county's Archives Bureau. His illegal gains were not confiscated, and the timber he illegally felled was not turned in.

    偷砍盗伐木材  挪窝照当局长
    杜玉杰于1987年初任我省周至县林业局长。上任不久，他便利用职权，偷砍盗伐林木，同时还在林区大量无证收购不法分子砍伐的木料，盗运出山，转手倒卖，谋取私利。他不顾国家下达的指令性限额采伐计划，仅1987年就私自增大采伐木材指标360多立方米。在他的影响下，周至县一时间偷砍盗伐林木成风。杜玉杰任县林业局长仅7个月，便在县城另建了一栋带地下室的两层楼房，建筑面积达230多平方米。
    杜玉杰的违法乱纪活动，被当地林业干部群众揭露后，周至县委、县政府在上级领导部门的督促下，免去了杜玉杰林业局长职务，但又任命他为县档案局局长。他的非法所得没有没收，连他偷砍的木头也没有上交。
