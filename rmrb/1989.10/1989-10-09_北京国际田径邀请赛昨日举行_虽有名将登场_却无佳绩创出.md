The Beijing International Athletics Invitational was held yesterday. Although there were star athletes present, no outstanding records were set.

Beijing, October 8 (Xinhua) - Reporters Li Beida and Wu Hui reported: The overall level of this year's Beijing International Athletics Invitational was not as high as in previous years. Despite the presence of world-renowned athletes such as the Soviet Union's Lisoftskaya, China's Huang Zhi Hong, and East Germany's Mezensky, no thrilling records were created.

The competition was held this afternoon at the Xiannongtan Stadium, with athletes from 10 countries and regions participating. The women's shot put and discus throw were the highlights of this event. Lisoftskaya, who once set a world record of 22.63 meters, and the world cup champion Huang Zhi Hong both hoped to perform well in today's good weather, but their actions did not meet their expectations. In the end, Huang Zhi Hong took first place in the shot put with a distance of 19.90 meters, while Lisoftskaya only managed 19.31 meters. In the discus throw, Chinese athlete Yu Hourun took the lead with a distance of 64.46 meters, while Mezensky from East Germany threw 58.78 meters. In the men's 100 meters, a Soviet athlete won with a time of 10.73 seconds, while Zhang Hong from China came in second with 10.76 seconds. In the women's 100 meters, Ge Weidong from China took first place with a time of 12.04 seconds. China's high jump star Jin Ling easily won first place with a height of 1.88 meters. The best result in the men's high jump was 2.25 meters, achieved by the young Chinese athlete Xu Yang.

A representative from the Chinese Athletics Association, Lou Dapeng, told reporters that due to the recent participation of many Chinese athletes in various domestic and international competitions, their physical condition has not yet recovered, resulting in average performances. Tomorrow, they will resume training to prepare for the Asian Athletics Championships to be held in New Delhi, India, from November 4 to 19.

    北京国际田径邀请赛昨日举行
    虽有名将登场　却无佳绩创出
    本报北京10月8日讯　记者李北大、吴骅报道：今年北京国际田径邀请赛的整体水平不如往年，虽有苏联的利索夫斯卡娅、中国的黄志红和民主德国的麦兹恩斯基等世界名将登场献技，但并没有创造出令人振奋的佳绩。
    比赛是今天下午在先农坛体育场举行的，共有10个国家和地区的选手角逐。女子铅球和女子铁饼是这次赛事的热点，曾创造出22米63世界纪录的利索夫斯卡娅和世界杯田径赛冠军黄志红都很想在今天这样的好天气下有所表现，但动作不从心。最后，黄志红以19米90取得了铅球第一名，利索夫斯卡娅只投出19米31。铁饼比赛，中国名将于厚润名列榜首，成绩为64米46，民主德国的麦兹恩斯基为58米78。男子百米，苏联选手以10秒73夺魁，第二名是中国的张宏，成绩是10秒76。女子百米，中国队葛卫东以12秒04取得第一名。我国跳高女杰金玲以1米88轻取第一。男子跳高最好成绩为2米25，它的创造者是中国小将徐阳。
    中国田协负责人楼大鹏对记者说，由于前一段时间，我国田径好手连续参加各种国内外大赛，体力至今未得到恢复，因此成绩平平。明天，他们又将投入集训，迎接11月4日至19日在印度新德里举行的亚洲田径锦标赛。
