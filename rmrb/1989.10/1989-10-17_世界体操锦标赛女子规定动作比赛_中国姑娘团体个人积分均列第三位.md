	Women's Compulsory Exercises at the World Gymnastics Championships: Chinese Girls Rank Third in Both Team and Individual Scores

	Xinhua News Agency, Stuttgart, October 16th – Reporter Jiang Jian Guo reports: The Chinese women's gymnastics team finished third in the compulsory exercises of the women's team event today at 2:00 PM (9:00 PM Beijing time) with a total score of 195.896. The Soviet Union team topped the rankings with 198.058 points, while Romania came in second with 196.447 points. The United States team scored 193.895 points, placing fourth. The Democratic Republic of Germany and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea tied for fifth with 191.970 points each. The results of the compulsory exercises indicate that the Chinese women's team has the potential to finish in the top three and has a good chance of improving upon their sixth-place finish at the Seoul Olympics.

	The Chinese team excelled in the balance beam event. Yang Bo scored 9.95 points, tying with Svetlana Boginskaya of the Soviet Union, who was the Olympic champion in Seoul. They were the only two out of 190 athletes to achieve this score. Chen Cuiting scored 9.837 points, Li Yan 9.8 points, Wang Wenjing 9.762 points, and Fan Di 9.737 points on the balance beam. This demonstrates that the Chinese team's understanding and execution of the compulsory exercises during their pre-competition training were correct and on point. Their sequence of side handstand, small flip, split jump, followed by a shoulder roll and back handstand was executed flawlessly, better than any other country. The balance beam judge, Gackey from the United States, highly praised this sequence as "perfect."

	Yang Bo's individual score was 39.649 points, second only to Boginskaya and Daniela Silivas of Romania. She scored 9.825 points on the vault, 9.937 points on the uneven bars, 9.95 points on the balance beam, and 9.937 points on the floor exercise.

	Deputy head coach Qian Kui told our reporter that the Chinese team performed better than expected in the compulsory exercises, with no mistakes from the entire team. This shows that the Chinese team's pre-competition training was solid, and their on-site performance was very stable. He said that the Chinese women's team is better than Romania in some events and has made significant improvements since the Seoul Olympics.

	The Soviet and Romanian women's teams continue to maintain a strong momentum. Olesya Dudnik of the Soviet Union scored a perfect 10 on the floor exercise, while Silivas of Romania scored a perfect 10 on the vault. In the top 10 individual scores, there are 5 from the Soviet Union, 2 from Romania, 2 from China (Yang Bo and Fan Di), and 1 from the United States.

	The optional exercises portion of the team event will begin this afternoon. The men's optional exercises final will be held tomorrow evening.

	Head coach Yang Mingming said that the difficulty of the Chinese men's team's optional exercises has improved compared to Li Ning's generation. Deputy head coach Qian Kui said that the women's team's optional exercises have unique features.

    世界体操锦标赛女子规定动作比赛
    中国姑娘团体个人积分均列第三位
    本报斯图加特10月16日电  记者江建国报道：中国女子体操队在今天下午14时（北京时间21时）结束的女子团体赛规定动作比赛中，以总分195.896分的成绩名列第三。苏联队以198.058分的成绩名列榜首，罗马尼亚队总分196.447分，居第二位。美国队193.895分，居第四位。民主德国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国队以191.970分的相同成绩并列第五。规定动作的成绩表明，中国女队具有前三名的实力，很有希望改善汉城奥运会第6名的成绩。
    中国女队在平衡木一项中表现突出。杨波个人在这一项中获得9.95分，与苏联队的汉城奥运会冠军斯维特兰娜·博金斯卡娅并列，是190名运动员中获此殊荣的两人之一。陈翠婷的平衡木9.837分，李燕9.8分，王文静9.762分，樊迪9.737分。这说明，中国女队在赛前训练中对规定动作的理解完全正确，思路对头，其中的侧手翻小翻接分腿跳，再接后滚肩背倒立一组动作，从理解到完成，比任何国家都做得好。平衡木裁判长、美国的加克菲高度赞扬中国队这一组动作是“完美无缺”的。
    杨波个人成绩积分39.649分，仅次于博金斯卡娅和罗马尼亚名将达妮埃拉·西利瓦斯。她的跳马获9.825分，高低杠9.937分，平衡木9.95分，自由体操9.937分。
    中国队副总教练钱奎对本报记者说，女子规定动作中国队发挥得比预想的好，全队无一人失误。说明中国队赛前训练基础扎实，临场表现也相当稳定。他说，中国女队某些项目比罗马尼亚还好，在汉城奥运会的基础上已有相当的提高。
    苏联女队和罗马尼亚女队仍保持咄咄逼人的势头。苏联的奥列霞·杜德尼克获得自由体操满分，罗马尼亚的西利瓦斯获跳马满分。在个人积分最高的前10名中，有苏联队5人，罗马尼亚队2人，中国队2人（杨波和樊迪），美国队1人。
    团体赛自选动作部分将于今天下午渐次展开。男子自选动作决赛将于明晚进行。
    中国队总教练杨明明说，中国男队自选动作难度比李宁那一代人有提高。钱奎副总教练说，女队自选动作有独创之处。
