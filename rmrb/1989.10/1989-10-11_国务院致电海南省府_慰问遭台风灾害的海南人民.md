Hainan Provincial People's Government:

Due to the recent two typhoons, most of your province has suffered serious disasters, causing significant damage to industrial and agricultural production and the lives and property of the people. The State Council extends its heartfelt sympathies to you and, through you, to the broad masses in the disaster-stricken areas and to all levels of cadres, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, public security officers, armed police, and medical personnel who are fighting on the front lines of disaster relief. We hope that you will mobilize all available forces to do a good job in rescue and relief work, carry out production self-reliance, arrange for the living needs of the people in the disaster-stricken areas, and quickly restore production and rebuild homes. Reduce the losses caused by the typhoon to the minimum and achieve victory in the anti-disaster struggle.
