The Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region recently issued a notice, requiring efforts to promote the subscription and distribution of key party newspapers and magazines for the coming year, with a focus on "People's Daily," "Seeking Truth" magazine, and local party newspapers and magazines.

The notice points out that after experiencing the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, various levels of leadership and the broad masses of cadres and people have further emphasized the importance of ideological and political work, showing greater concern for political affairs and national issues, thereby enhancing their enthusiasm for subscribing to newspapers and magazines.

From Yinchuan, our reporter Huang Yiming reports: The Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region issued a notice on October 20, requiring all regions in the autonomous region to do a good job in the subscription and distribution of party newspapers and magazines. The notice clearly states that "People's Daily," "Seeking Truth" magazine, and local party newspapers and magazines are the key focus for the 1990 subscription and distribution work.

The notice points out that party committees at all levels and party branches in government agencies, enterprises, and institutions should have at least one newspaper and one magazine. Party branches in rural areas should have party newspapers.
