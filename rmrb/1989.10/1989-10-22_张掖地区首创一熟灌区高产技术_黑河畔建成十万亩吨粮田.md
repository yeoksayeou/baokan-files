People's Daily, Zhangye, October 21st - Reporter Zhang Shusheng reports: The Zhangye region of Gansu Province has successfully developed 100,000 mu (approximately 6,667 hectares) of high-yield grain fields along the Black River through scientific and technological contracting. This project was recently approved by experts. The experts highly evaluated this scientific and technological development project and noted that achieving 100,000 mu of high-yield grain fields in a single-crop irrigation area is a first in the country. The yield per unit area and cultivation techniques are leading the nation.

Since the 1970s, local farmers and scientific and technological personnel have conducted repeated experiments and research, exploring a new high-yield path through strip planting. The high-yield development research project for 100,000 mu of grain fields is based on this research achievement. The project is led by the Zhangye Regional Agricultural Science Institute, with contracts signed at various levels. The contract stipulates that from 1987 to 1989, 100,000 mu of high-yield grain fields should be built on the basis of an average yield of 799 kg per mu, and the cultivation technology for achieving a yield of one ton per mu should be proposed.

These grain fields are distributed along the Black River in Zhangye, Linze, and Gaotai counties (cities), and are contracted to 30,000 households. Through 12 experimental, demonstration, and promotion bases, models were created, experiences were summarized, and a radiating effect was achieved.

After three years of hard work, the actual contracted farmland amounted to 105,451 mu, with an average yield of 1,024.6 kg per mu, and a total increase of 45.26 million kg of grain.

　　张掖地区首创一熟灌区高产技术
　　黑河畔建成十万亩吨粮田
    本报张掖10月21日电　记者张述圣报道：甘肃省张掖地区在黑河沿岸通过科技承包，建成10万亩吨粮田并于日前通过鉴定。参加鉴定的专家高度评价这一科技开发项目，同时认为，在一熟灌区建成10万亩吨粮田尚属国内首创，其单产和栽培技术在全国居领先地位。
    从70年代开始，这里的农民和科技人员经过反复试验研究，探索出带状种植的高产新途径，10万亩吨粮田高额丰产技术开发研究课题，就是在这个研究成果基础上提出的。该课题由张掖地区农科所主持，逐级签订了承包合同。合同规定从1987年到1989年的3年内，在平均亩产799公斤的基础上，建成10万亩吨粮田，并提出亩产吨粮的栽培技术规程。
    这些粮田分布在张掖、临泽、高台三县（市）黑河沿岸，承包到3万个农户。通过12个试验、示范、推广三结合基点，作出样板、总结经验，起到了典型引路的辐射作用。
    经过3年的艰苦努力，实际承包农田105451亩，平均亩产达到1024.6公斤，累计增产粮食4526万公斤。
