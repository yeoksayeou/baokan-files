The Netherlands, a country renowned for its tulips, ancient windmills, and cows, has now become the "dirtiest" nation in Western Europe. Outside the port of Rotterdam lies a 5-kilometer-long underwater fault line, which the Dutch have blocked with a massive dike to keep out the waves. Along the Rhine River, toxic waste from densely packed industries and cities is continuously discharged into the sea through a large vent in the dike. Experts say that in another 20 years, this underwater fault line will be completely filled. Severe pollution has made the Netherlands a focal point of the environmental movement sweeping across Europe. This May, the Dutch government collapsed primarily due to public concerns over the environment, a first in Western Europe. This seems to indicate that issues such as East-West conflict and unemployment, which have long been of concern to Western Europeans, are giving way to environmental issues.

The Netherlands, dubbed the "sewer of Europe," is currently highly sensitive to environmental problems. Three of Europe's most polluted rivers—the Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt—all flow through this small country. The 14.7 million people living on this land are also a significant source of pollution. The Netherlands is the most densely populated country in Europe, with a population density 14 times that of the United States. In terms of per-unit area, the Netherlands has the most cars, burns the most solid fuels, and uses the most fertilizers in Europe. Consequently, pollution is most severe here.

Thus, environmental issues became the main point of contention in the Netherlands' September elections. According to public opinion polls, the majority of people in this country would rather sacrifice improvements in their living standards to achieve a cleaner environment. The National Federation of Christian Trade Unions in the Netherlands is willing to freeze wages for this purpose. The Christian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party, to counter the radical Green Party, are competing to propose a grand plan for pollution control. The overall goal is to cut off 70% of pollution sources over the next 20 years. The main issue debated during the election was how to raise the funds for this. According to the pollution control plan, this aspect of spending will balloon to $6.5 billion by 1994, and by the end of the century or the beginning of the next, it will exceed 3% of the national GDP, higher than the current defense budget.

Looking at Western Europe as a whole, severe industrial pollution has heightened people's environmental awareness, and the rise of the Green Party in recent years is a reflection of this trend. In the European Parliament elections this summer, the Green Party made a significant impact in various Western European countries. It secured 15% of the vote in Britain, much to the surprise of Prime Minister Thatcher. In France and Italy, it also made considerable progress. In West Germany, people have already started discussing whether there might be a left-wing coalition government of the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party next year. It seems that the environmental protection movement represented by the Green Party is becoming an important political phenomenon in Western Europe.

    从荷兰的环境问题看西欧绿党
    刘绪民
    荷兰，这个素以郁金香、古老风车和奶牛闻名于世的美丽的国度，如今已变成西欧国家中“最脏的国家”。鹿特丹海港的外边是一道5公里长的海底断层，荷兰人筑以大堤堵住了海浪。莱茵河畔密集的工业和城市沉积的有毒垃圾通过堤上的一个巨大通风洞源源不断地注入海底。据专家们讲，再有20年，这道海底断层就会被填满。严重的污染使荷兰成了席卷欧洲的环保运动的一个风口。今年5月，荷兰政府主要因人们对环境的担忧而垮台，这在西欧还是第一次。这似乎表明，西欧人所一向担心的东西方冲突和失业等问题正在让位给对环境问题的关心。
    被称为“欧洲污水坑”的荷兰，当前对环境问题极为敏感。欧洲大陆受工业污染严重的三条河流——莱茵河、默兹河和斯尔海德河都流经这个国土有限的国家。而生活在这块土地上的1470万人也是严重的污染源。荷兰是欧洲人口最稠密的国家，其人口稠密度为美国的14倍。若按单位面积计算，荷兰是欧洲汽车最多、燃烧固体燃料最多和使用化肥最多的国家。污染问题也就最为突出。
    这样，环境问题成了荷兰9月选举中争议的主要议题。据民意测验表明，这个国家绝大多数人宁愿牺牲生活水平的提高，而获得一个比较清洁的环境。荷兰基督教工会全国联合会为此而愿意冻结工资。基督教民主党和社会民主党为了对付激进的绿党，竞相提出一项治理污染的宏大规划。总目标是，在今后20年中，切断70％的污染源。竞选中争论的主要问题是如何筹集这笔费用。按治理规划，这方面的费用到1994年将膨胀到65亿美元，到本世纪末下世纪初，将超出国民总产值的3％，高于现在的国防预算。
    从整个西欧看，工业污染严重使得人们的环保意识不断提高，近几年绿党的崛起就是这股潮流的一种反映。在今年夏天的欧洲议会选举中，绿党在西欧各国大出风头。它在英国获得15％的选票，使撒切尔首相大为吃惊。在法国和意大利等国，它也取得很大进展。尤其是在西德，人们已经开始议论这样的问题：明年会不会出现一个左翼社会民主党和绿党的联合政府呢？看来，绿党所代表的环境保护潮流正在成为西欧的一个重要政治现象。
