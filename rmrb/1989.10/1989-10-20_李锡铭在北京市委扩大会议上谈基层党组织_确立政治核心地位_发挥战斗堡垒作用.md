At a recent meeting of the Sixth Plenum (expanded) of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Li Xixiang, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, said that the Party's leadership over the state and society ultimately needs to be realized through the combat fortress role of grassroots party organizations and the exemplary role of party members. Fully playing the political core role of grassroots party organizations is an important link in strengthening party building at present.

Li Xixiang said that in units implementing the director responsibility system, the party organization should put forward opinions and participate in decisions on the unit's long-term development plans, annual production work plans, major technological transformations and construction projects, wage and bonus distribution principles, and the arrangement of important work for a period. Administrative leaders in units should proactively submit their ideas or plans to the party committee for discussion before making decisions on major issues in the unit and seriously listen to the party committee's opinions.

He pointed out that party committees in higher education institutions under the leadership of the party committee and the president responsibility system, street party committees exercising the functions of district party committees, and party committees at the township level and below in rural areas have different functions and tasks from those of party organizations in enterprises and institutions. They do not participate in decisions on major issues in the unit but make decisions. The party organization keeps watch over political principles, political directions, and major policies and guidelines, rather than interfering in the daily work of administrative leaders.

When talking about the principle of the party managing cadres, Li Xixiang emphasized that the various levels of organizations of the ruling party must undertake the responsibility of educating, managing, and supervising cadres. In units implementing the director responsibility system, administrative leaders have the right to nominate, appoint, and use middle-level administrative cadres. However, before appointments, they must be jointly investigated by the party and government departments in charge of cadre work and discussed by the party committee and the administrative leadership collective.

Li Xixiang pointed out that when playing the political core role of enterprise party organizations, attention should be paid to handling the relationship between the political core position of enterprise party organizations and the central position of factory directors and managers.

    李锡铭在北京市委扩大会议上谈基层党组织
    确立政治核心地位  发挥战斗堡垒作用
    据新华社北京10月19日电　（记者徐光春、黄智敏）中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭在近日举行的北京市委六届七次全体（扩大）会议上说，党对国家和社会生活的领导最终要通过基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用来实现。充分发挥基层党组织的政治核心作用，是当前加强党的建设的一个重要环节。
    李锡铭说，实行行政首长负责制的企事业单位，党组织对本单位的长远发展规划、年度生产工作计划、重大技术改造和建设项目、工资奖金分配原则、一个时期重要工作的安排等，要提出意见，参与决定。企事业单位行政领导在对本单位的重大问题作出决定前，要主动把设想或方案提交党委讨论，认真听取党委意见。
    他指出，实行党委领导下的校长负责制的高等学校党委，行使区委派出机构职责的街道党委，以及农村乡以下党委，其职能和任务同企事业单位的党组织不同，对本单位的重大问题不是参与决定，而是作出决定。党组织在政治原则、政治方向和重大方针政策上把关，而不是去干预行政领导的日常工作。
    在谈到党管干部的原则时，李锡铭强调，执政党的各级组织都必须承担教育、管理、监督干部的责任。实行行政首长负责制的企事业单位，行政领导拥有对中层行政干部的提名权、任免权、使用权。但在任免前必须经党、政主管干部工作的部门共同考察，经党的委员会和行政领导集体讨论。
    李锡铭指出，在发挥企业党组织的政治核心作用的时候，要注意处理好企业党组织的政治核心地位与厂长、经理的中心地位的关系。
