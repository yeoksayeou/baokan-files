Police officers across the country will begin changing to the new 1989-style police uniforms after the National Day holiday, following approval by the State Council.

It is reported that the new uniforms will retain the olive green color, with slight modifications to the style. The summer uniform will see the most significant changes, shifting from the Zhongshan suit style to a small lapel style, paired with a white shirt and a chestnut-colored tie. The tie will feature the Chinese pinyin spelling of "police" and will be accompanied by a special tie clip. Male officers will continue to wear the current peaked cap, with the black decorative band replaced by a gold braided band. Female officers will start wearing a cap with a brim from next summer. The original red trouser stripes will be discontinued.

The new uniforms will replace the red armbands with a red shield emblem bordered by a gold pine branch on the lapel. Different symbols within the shield will distinguish various police units. All police officers, regardless of unit, will use the Great Wall emblem on their armbands.

    公安干警“十一”起改换新装
    经国务院批准，全国公安干警将从今年国庆节后陆续改着八九式人民警察服装。
    据介绍，新警服颜色仍为橄榄色，警服制式略有改动，变化较大的是夏服，由中山装式样改为小翻领式样，配有白色衬衣，系枣红色领带，领带表面织有警察二字的汉语拼音字样，并配有专用领带卡。男干警继续使用现行大沿帽，帽上原有黑色装饰带改为金黄色编织装饰带；女干警将从明年夏季开始陆续改戴有檐筒式帽；取消原有红裤线。
    新式警服将取消红领章，改用红盾牌衬以金黄色松枝的领花。红盾牌内绘有不同标志，用以区分不同警种。公安干警不分警种统一使用长城图案臂章。　（新华社）
