The grain in the hands of farmers can be stored in a "bank" like money and can also be exchanged for various grain and oil products at will. A reform in Huaxiong County, Hunan Province, has given the surplus grain in farmers' jars and pots the function of an equivalent exchange.

Last May, Dongshan Grain Station in Huaxiong County pioneered the establishment of a "grain bank" in Hunan, providing a "one-stop" service for farmers, including storage, management, free processing, and mutual exchange of grain.

The grain station's operation of the "grain bank" has helped farmers solve the difficulties of grain storage and processing, and has turned the "dead grain" in farmers' homes into "live grain" that can be circulated, thus storing more grain for the country. Since this year, Dongshan Grain Station has stored and processed 2 million kilograms of grain for farmers free of charge, of which 370,000 kilograms have been added as circulating grain for the country.

Providing socialized services for farmers has shown a promising prospect for the grain department to shift from single operation to comprehensive operation. According to the calculation of Huaxiong County Grain Bureau, through the deep processing of grain, a profit of 2 yuan can be obtained for every 100 kilograms of rice. The social benefits brought by the "grain bank" are even more significant. Huaxiong County has about 250 million kilograms of grain left in the hands of farmers every year. After these grains are stored in the "bank," even if only the rice yield is increased by one item, the county can increase at least 220,000 tons of rice, equivalent to the output of 30,000 mu of paddy fields.

Currently, the four "grain bank" pilot projects in Huaxiong County have been welcomed by farmers, and more and more farmers have obtained grain deposit books.

    华容县开拓社会服务渠道
    “粮食银行”利国利农为农
    民代管、代储、免费加工、兑换粮食，一举多得
    本报长沙10月11日电　农民手中的粮食，可以像钱一样存入“银行”，也可以随意兑换各种粮油制品。湖南省华容县的一项改革，赋予农家坛坛罐罐里的余粮以等价交换物的功用。
    华容县东山粮站去年5月在湖南率先建立“粮食银行”，开展为农民代管、代储、免费加工、互利兑换粮食的“一条龙”服务。
    粮站开办“粮食银行”，帮助农民解决了粮食储存、加工的困难，同时将农民家中的“死粮”变成了可供周转的“活粮”，为国家多储了粮食。今年以来，东山粮站已代农民免费储存、加工粮食200万公斤，其中给国家新增37万公斤周转粮。
    为农民提供社会化服务，展示了粮食部门从单一经营走向综合经营的可喜前景。据华容县粮食局测算，通过对粮食的深加工，每百公斤大米可获利两元。“粮食银行”带来的社会效益，则更加可观。华容县每年留在农民手中的粮食约2.5亿公斤。这些粮食存入“银行”后，仅以提高出米率一项计算，全县至少增加2.2万吨稻谷，相当于增加了3万亩水田的产量。
    目前，华容县的四个“粮食银行”试点受到农民的欢迎，越来越多的农民领取了粮食存折。　（杜若原　李华锋）
