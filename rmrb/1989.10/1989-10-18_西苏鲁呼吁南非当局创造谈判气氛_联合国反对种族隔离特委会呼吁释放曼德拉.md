Sisulu Calls on South African Authorities to Create Atmosphere for Negotiations
UN Committee Against Apartheid Calls for Release of Mandela

Xinhua News Agency Harare, October 16 – Walter Sisulu, the recently released former general secretary of the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa, reiterated the conditions for his organization to negotiate with the authorities and called on South African President F.W. de Klerk to make "clear efforts" to create a favorable atmosphere.

Sisulu was released on October 15. At a press conference held after returning to his hometown, he said that the South African authorities must release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners, lift the state of emergency, abolish laws restricting personal freedoms, and allow all exiles to return home.

He said that if these demands are not met, the ANC has no choice but to continue the struggle.

He said that his spirit of dedicating himself to the struggle against apartheid has not weakened but has been strengthened by his long imprisonment due to the development of the domestic situation and his confidence in the future of South Africa.

He emphasized that it is the responsibility of the ANC leadership to continue to pressure the South African authorities to abandon the apartheid policy.

This was the first press conference held since the ANC was banned in 1960. Other seven black movement leaders who were released with Sisulu also attended the press conference.

Xinhua News Agency United Nations, October 16 – The United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid today called on the South African authorities to "unconditionally release" black liberation movement leader Nelson Mandela.

The committee's statement pointed out that the unconditional release of Mandela and all other political prisoners is an "important prerequisite for creating a favorable atmosphere for meaningful negotiations in South Africa."

This is the third time in a week that the United Nations has issued a call for Mandela's release.

On October 11, UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and UN General Assembly President Salim Ahmed Salim also made similar calls, urging the South African authorities to abandon the apartheid system and create the necessary conditions for establishing a society without racial, color, or religious discrimination.

    西苏鲁呼吁南非当局创造谈判气氛
    联合国反对种族隔离特委会呼吁释放曼德拉
    新华社哈博罗内10月16日电　刚刚获释的南非非洲人国民大会前总书记西苏鲁重申他的组织同当局谈判的先决条件，呼吁南非总统德克勒克为创造良好的气氛，作出“明显的努力”。
    西苏鲁是15日获得释放的。他在回到自己的家乡后举行的记者招待会上说，南非当局必须释放纳尔逊·曼德拉和所有其他政治犯，取消紧急状态，废除限制人身自由的法律，允许所有流亡在外的人返回家园。
    他说，如果这些要求得不到满足，南非非洲人国民大会除了继续进行斗争之外别无选择。
    他说，因国内形势的发展和对南非前途充满信心，他献身反种族隔离斗争的精神并没有因长期监禁而减弱反而是增强了。
    他强调，继续给南非当局施加压力，迫使其放弃种族隔离政策是南非非洲人国民大会领导人的责任。
    这是自1960年南非非洲人国民大会被禁止以来举行的第一次记者招待会。同西苏鲁一起获释的其他7名黑人运动领袖也出席了记者招待会。
    新华社联合国10月16日电  联合国反对种族隔离特别委员会今天呼吁南非当局“无条件释放”黑人解放运动领导人纳尔逊·曼德拉。
    该委员会发表的一项声明指出，无条件释放曼德拉和其他全部政治犯是“为在南非举行有意义的谈判创造有利的气氛的重要前提”。
    这是联合国一星期之内第3次发出要求释放曼德拉的呼吁。
    10月11日，联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔和联大主席加尔巴也发出类似呼吁，敦促南非当局放弃种族隔离制度，为建立一个人人平等、没有种族、肤色和信仰歧视的社会创造必要条件。
