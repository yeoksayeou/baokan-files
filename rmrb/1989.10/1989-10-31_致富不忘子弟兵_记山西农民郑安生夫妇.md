The story of young farmers Zheng Ansheng and his wife, who established a "Family Volunteer Military Support Service Station" after becoming wealthy, is widely praised in Xiangling Town, Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province.

Since 1983, Zheng Ansheng and his wife, Lian Jianlan, started a family edible mushroom cultivation farm with just 30 yuan and a 3-square-meter small house. By 1984, their pure income exceeded 10,000 yuan. They were not satisfied with their initial success and established the "May 4th Youth Edible Mushroom Technology School" to spread their wealth-creation experience. Lian Jianlan wrote over 300,000 words of edible mushroom technology teaching materials, enrolling both on-site and correspondence students. They attracted 25,000 students from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide, with over 95% of them able to apply the technology in practice. The small courtyard of Zhongxing Village became a place to spread knowledge and teach skills to the youth. Zheng Ansheng and Lian Jianlan knew that their family's initial wealth was due to the good policies of the Party. Later, seeing that many military and revolutionary martyrs' families were facing difficulties, they established the "Family Volunteer Military Support Service Station," dedicating their love for the country and the soldiers to these families.

Zheng Ansheng and Lian Jianlan conducted a survey of all 21 military and revolutionary martyrs' families in the village, establishing the "Zhongxing Village Military and Revolutionary Martyrs' Families Archive." This included details such as the number of laborers in each family, sources of income, living conditions, health of elderly military and revolutionary martyrs, housing situations, and any special circumstances. Based on these records, they periodically provided care for each military and revolutionary martyrs' family. After young soldier Xing Hairong enlisted, his family faced difficulties. His father was chronically ill and unable to work, his younger brother had rickets and needed care, and his grandmother was elderly. The family relied solely on his mother. Lian Jianlan and Zheng Ansheng regularly visited their home, delivering a truckload of coal in winter and 100 yuan in spending money in autumn. Xing Hairong's mother was moved and said, "The Zheng couple have good hearts..."

The Zheng Ansheng and Lian Jianlan Family Volunteer Military Support Service Station invested 10,000 yuan to establish the "Promoting National Defense Construction Award Fund." Each year, they award local soldiers once, giving each enlisted soldier 50 yuan in preferential allowance and each demobilized soldier 50 yuan in production assistance. Soldiers who receive commendations from the regiment level and above are awarded between 50 and 200 yuan. Those who are recognized as advanced examples of caring for national defense construction at the provincial level and above are awarded 500 yuan.

The Zheng Ansheng and Lian Jianlan Family Volunteer Military Support Service Station always keeps the soldiers' well-being in mind, staying connected with their hearts. Among the 6,500-plus cadres and soldiers who studied at their edible mushroom technology school, they all received a 20% discount on tuition fees. This alone resulted in an annual loss of over 14,000 yuan. When a certain unit in Taiyuan, Shanxi, learned about their school, they sent soldier Yin Haisheng to attend the on-site classes. At the time, all the students' accommodations were full, so Zheng Ansheng and his wife laid out mats on the floor and gave the soldier their bed to sleep in, patiently teaching him each technique. Lian Jianlan also took mushroom spores to the unit, helping the soldiers cultivate 160 square meters of oyster mushrooms, not only improving the unit's living conditions but also earning over 1,000 yuan in income. The couple also sent 50 sets of edible mushroom technology teaching materials to the frontline troops in Laoshan, helping the border guards master this technology. Over three years, the Zheng Ansheng Family Volunteer Military Support Service Station received over 10,000 letters of thanks from soldiers.

Over the years, Zheng Ansheng and Lian Jianlan have invested over 70,000 yuan in national defense construction. It is understood that 70% of their income is used for expanding production, 20% for national defense construction and public welfare, and 10% for their own living expenses. To this day, their home does not have a single sofa, washing machine, or fancy residence.

　　致富不忘子弟兵
    ——记山西农民郑安生夫妇
    本报记者　王艾生
    青年农民郑安生夫妇致富后办“家庭义务拥军服务站”的事迹，在山西省襄汾县襄陵镇广为传颂。
    从1983年开始，郑安生和爱人连建兰利用仅有的30元资金和3平方米的小屋，办起一个家庭食用菌养殖场，到1984年纯收入就逾万元。他们不为眼前的成功满足，又办起一个“五四青年食用菌技术学校”，把自己的致富经验传播开去，连建兰编写出30余万字的食用菌技术教材，招收面授、函授学员，吸引了全国29个省、市、自治区的2.5万名学员，学完后能在实际中运用食用菌技术的占95％以上。中兴村这座小小的院落，成为向青年传播知识、传授技术的场所。郑安生、连建兰深知，他们的家庭能开始富起来，全凭党的好政策。后来，他们看到不少军属、烈属家庭生活困难，又办起“家庭义务拥军服务站”，把一个普通农民对祖国和人民子弟兵之爱，奉献给军烈属。
    郑安生和连建兰对全村21户军属、烈属进行调查，建立起“中兴村军烈属档案”。包括家有几个劳力，收入来源，生活状况，军烈属老人身体状况，住房情况以及有什么特殊情况等等，分门别类，予以记载。依据这些资料，他们分期对每一个军烈属家庭给予关心。青年邢海红入伍后，家庭生活困难，父亲常年患病，无劳动能力，弟弟患佝偻症需要人伺侯，奶奶年迈，家境仅靠母亲一人操持。连建兰和郑安生定期到他家访问，冬季送上一卡车煤炭，秋季又送上100元零用钱。邢海红的母亲感动地说：“安生两口，人心好……”
    郑安生、连建兰家庭义务拥军服务站出资1万元，又建起“促进国防建设奖励基金”，每年向本村籍战士颁奖一次，奖给每个入伍战士50元优待金，每个复员战士50元生产扶助金。战士在服役期间受团以上嘉奖，分别奖励50元至200元。凡被授予省以上关心国防建设的先进典型，奖励500元。
    郑安生、连建兰家庭义务拥军服务站，时刻把战士的冷暖挂心头，同战士心心相连。参加他们办的食用菌技术学校学习的干部战士共6500余人，他们一律按优惠20％收学费。仅这一项，他们每年少收入1.4万余元。驻山西太原某部得知他们办食用菌技术学校消息时，派战士尹海生来校参加面授，当时学员已住满，郑安生夫妇打地铺，腾出床让战士睡，并逐项耐心教授技术。连建兰还带上菌种到部队，帮助战士种植160平方米的平菇，不仅改善了连队生活，还获得千余元的收益。郑安生夫妇还寄给老山前线部队50套食用菌技术教材，帮助边防战士掌握这项技术。3年多的时间，郑安生家庭义务拥军服务站收到战士寄来的感谢信1万余封。
    郑安生、连建兰夫妇几年来用于国防建设的投资达7万多元。据了解，他们的收入，70％用于扩大再生产，20％用于国防建设和社会公益事业，10％用于自己生活消费。至今，他家没有一套沙发，没有一台洗衣机，也没有讲究的住宅。
