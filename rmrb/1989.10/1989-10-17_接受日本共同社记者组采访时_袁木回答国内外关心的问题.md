Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 16th.

On the afternoon of October 15th, Spokesperson for the State Council Yuan Mu received an interview from a group of reporters from Kyodo News Agency led by the Chief of the Beijing Bureau of Kyodo News Agency, Ito Masashi, at the Great Hall of the People. He answered some questions of concern both domestically and internationally.

The 5th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is likely to be held at the end of this month or the beginning of next month.

Q: It is said that the 5th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is about to be held. Can you provide further details?

A: As far as I know, the 5th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee is likely to be held at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. The main agenda of the meeting is to discuss economic issues and make important decisions on further rectification and stabilization of the national economy. Economic stability is the foundation for political and social stability. This meeting will certainly attract widespread attention from the people of the country and from friends abroad.

The economic situation is better than originally expected.

Q: China is currently facing some serious economic problems. Can you provide some prospects for the economic situation?

A: Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, China's economy has developed significantly. Over the past year or so, the implementation of rectification and deepening of reform has achieved initial results. From January to September this year, China's industrial production increased by 8.9% compared to the same period last year. In agriculture, the summer grain yield reached a historical high, and the early rice harvest was bountiful, with a combined increase of 351 million tons compared to last year. The rate of price increases has been gradually decreasing, and the trend of inflation has been initially controlled. The scale of fixed asset investment has been controlled, and the situation of currency withdrawal is relatively good. Overall, the national economy is developing steadily under rectification, and the situation is better than originally expected.

However, China's economy still faces significant challenges. These challenges are not just from the past one or two years but have accumulated over several years. Since the second half of 1984, China has experienced an economic overheating phenomenon to a certain extent, exceeding the national conditions and capabilities. The main problems are: (1) the scale of construction is too large, and the speed of development is too fast; (2) the economic structure is irrational, and some aspects are out of proportion; (3) economic efficiency is low, and there is serious waste in all aspects. Emphasizing micro-level activation is correct, but macro-control and management have been neglected; simplifying administration and delegating power is correct, but necessary concentration has been neglected, which has led to disorder in the economic order, especially in the circulation order. The Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, based on this situation, will take 3 years or more to further rectify and stabilize the national economy, focusing on continuing to control the total amount and reasonably adjust the structure. At the same time, deepen and improve various reform measures, adhere to the policy of opening up to the outside world. As long as the work is done well, China's economy can gradually move towards a path of sustained, stable, and coordinated development. I am optimistic about the prospects for China's economic development.

Social order has quickly returned to normal, and the political situation is stable.

Q: Recently, the People's Daily published an article emphasizing stability and unity. Does this mean that China currently has factors of instability and disunity? Or does it mean that the faction of Zhao Ziyang still has a significant influence?

A: In my opinion, after the suppression of the turmoil and the counter-revolutionary riot, it has only been a few months, and the social order has quickly returned to normal, people's hearts are stable, the political situation is stable, and the economy is developing steadily under rectification. This is not easy. This situation shows that the vast majority of the Chinese people trust and support the Party and the government. This is because they have personally experienced that since the founding of New China 40 years ago, adhering to the socialist path, especially in the past 10 years, focusing on modernization construction and reform and opening up, the country has gradually moved towards prosperity and strength, achieving what could not be achieved under the previous exploitative system. Therefore, everyone supports the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. The turmoil and riot aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party and subverting the socialist system are not popular. Now, emphasizing the consolidation and development of a stable and united political situation is to make everyone cherish this hard-won situation and cherish and defend the hard-won achievements of socialist construction. This does not mean that Comrade Zhao Ziyang or what you call the "Zhao Ziyang faction" still has much influence. Of course, Comrade Zhao Ziyang supported and indulged the spread of bourgeois liberalization during his tenure, and this ideological influence has not been completely eliminated. In addition, some of the instigators of the turmoil and riot will not give up easily, and some criminals have not been apprehended. These destabilizing factors still exist, but they should not be exaggerated. A fact that may support my view is that when the 4th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of our Party decided to remove Comrade Zhao Ziyang from his post, all the delegates present unanimously passed the decision. Moreover, party organizations at all levels, including grassroots organizations, and people from all walks of life have expressed their support for this decision through various channels.

It is impossible for the international community to isolate China.

Q: What is your comment on China's current relations with Western countries, mainly the United States, and the prospects for improvement?

A: Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, although there have been some problems between the two countries, overall, the development has been relatively smooth. The recent problems in the two countries' relations are mainly because some Western countries, mainly the United States, not only do not understand but also take a wrong position of grossly interfering in China's internal affairs by adopting measures such as so-called "economic sanctions" against China for the measures taken by China in suppressing the turmoil and the counter-revolutionary riot, which are purely for solving a country's internal affairs. The U.S. side has indicated that there are factors of being misled by wrong public opinion. Therefore, to improve the two countries' relations and overcome the current obstacles or troubles, the U.S. side should take the initiative. As long as the U.S. gives up interfering in China's internal affairs, our side has no problem with improving the two countries' relations.

China's modernization of the economy mainly relies on self-reliance, while also striving for foreign aid, including developing economic and trade relations and technological cooperation with Western developed countries. However, such things cannot be one-sided, but can only be carried out on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In my personal opinion, China's relations with Western countries, including the United States, and economic and trade exchanges with them will eventually develop. A most important fact is that the leadership position of the Communist Party of China is consolidated, and China's political situation is stable. The socialist China led by the Communist Party, with a population of 1.1 billion, stands in the East, and no one in the international community can deny this fact. It is impossible to isolate China.

As for the so-called "economic sanctions" against China, we have noticed that they have eased recently, but they have not been lifted and have not yet returned to normal. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated its attitude towards this: First, we are not afraid. China will not yield to any pressure of interfering in our internal affairs; Second, China will insist on fighting a reasonable, beneficial, and restrained battle. Of course, the so-called "sanctions" will bring some temporary difficulties to China, but they will also inspire the Chinese people to be self-reliant and strive for strength. Moreover, the "sanctions" will also cause harm to the "sanctioners."

I am optimistic about the prospects for the development of Sino-Japanese relations.

Q: What are your hopes for Sino-Japanese relations?

A: China and Japan are neighboring countries separated by a narrow strip of water. Both governments and peoples of the two countries hope that we can be friends forever, which is in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and the people of Asia and the world. Since the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, friendly cooperation between the two countries has developed significantly. Now, due to the reasons on the Japanese side, there are some unsatisfactory aspects, but we have also noticed that Japan's approach is somewhat different from that of some Western powers and has expressed a willingness to gradually change. I hope that, from a historical perspective, in the friendly relations between the two countries, some unpleasant situations are just an episode. As for hopes, politically, I hope that the two countries can maintain long-term friendly relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Economically, I hope that bilateral trade between the two countries will further expand, and China's trade deficit will further shrink; I hope that the agreement on financial cooperation between the two sides will continue to be implemented; I hope that there will be fewer obstacles and more openness in Japan's technology transfer. I am also optimistic about the prospects for the development of Sino-Japanese relations.

Firmly opposed to the "flexible diplomacy" pursued by the Taiwan authorities.

Q: What is your comment on the "flexible diplomacy" pursued by the Taiwan authorities?

A: The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and Taiwan is a sacred part of Chinese territory. Our principled position on this will not allow any change. We firmly oppose any speech and action that leads to Taiwan's secession from the motherland. Recently, the Chinese government has severed diplomatic relations with Grenada and Liberia, once again demonstrating our solemn position. The "flexible diplomacy" pursued by the Taiwan authorities, creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," will have no future and is firmly opposed by us. We will unswervingly follow the concept of "one country, two systems" to promote the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will follow the historical trend and make wise decisions that are conducive to national reunification.

The Chinese people will not forget the pain once healed.

Q: Recently, China has emphasized adhering to the four cardinal principles and strengthening ideological and political work. Does this mean a return to the "Cultural Revolution" period?

A: Our Party's basic line is "one center, two basic points," that is, with economic construction as the center, adhering to both the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up. In the previous period, due to the lack of adherence to the four cardinal principles, ideological and political work was weakened, which was the main domestic reason for the recent turmoil and riot. We have summed up the experience and lessons from this aspect, emphasizing the adherence to the four cardinal principles and strengthening ideological and political work, which is also to better and healthier promote the cause of modernization construction and reform and opening up. This is fundamentally different from the concept of returning to the "Cultural Revolution" period. The Chinese people have suffered enough from the "Cultural Revolution" and will not forget the pain once healed.

    接受日本共同社记者组采访时
    袁木回答国内外关心的问题
    新华社北京10月16日电（记者朱云龙）国务院发言人袁木10月15日下午在人民大会堂接受由共同社驻北京分社社长伊藤正率领的日本共同社记者组采访，回答了一些国内国外关心的问题。
    十三届五中全会可能本月底下月初召开
    问：听说中国共产党十三届五中全会即将召开，能否就此作进一步的透露？
    答：据我所知，十三届五中全会有可能在本月底或下月初召开，会议的主要议程是讨论经济问题，将就进一步治理整顿和实现国民经济的稳定发展作出重要决策。经济稳定是政治、社会稳定的基础。这次会议，肯定将为全国人民和国外朋友所普遍关注。
    经济情况比原来预想的好一些
    问：中国目前面临一些经济严重问题，能否对经济形势作点展望？
    答：中国共产党十一届三中全会以来，中国经济有了很大的发展。近一年多来，贯彻治理整顿、深化改革取得了初步成效。今年1至9月，我国工业生产比去年同期增长8.9％，农业方面夏粮产量创历史最高水平，早稻获得丰收，两者合计比去年增产351万吨。物价上涨幅度逐月回落，通货膨胀势头得到初步控制。固定资产投资规模有所控制，货币回笼情况比较好。总的来看，国民经济在治理整顿中平稳发展，情况比原来预想的要好一些。
    但是，目前我国经济还面临比较大的困难，这些困难不是这一两年才出现的，而是几年来积累下来的。从1984年下半年开始，我国就出现了在一定程度上超越国情国力的经济过热现象。主要的问题是：（1）建设规模过大，发展速度过快；（2）经济结构不合理，某些方面比例失调；（3）经济效益低，各方面铺张浪费严重。强调微观搞活是对的，但忽视了加强宏观控制和管理；简政放权是对的，但忽视了必要的集中，这就导致了经济秩序特别是流通秩序的混乱。党中央和国务院根据这种情况，用3年或者更长一些的时间，对国民经济进行进一步的治理整顿，重点是继续控制总量，合理调整结构，同时深化和完善各项改革措施，坚持实行对外开放。只要工作做得好，我国经济可望逐步走上持续、稳定、协调发展的轨道。我对中国经济的发展前景是乐观的。
    社会秩序迅速恢复正常政局稳定
    问：《人民日报》最近发表文章强调安定团结，这是否意味着中国现在还有不安定团结的因素？或者说赵紫阳一派还有较大的影响？
    答：我的看法是，中国在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱以后才短短几个月，社会秩序迅速恢复正常，人心稳定，政局稳定，经济也在治理整顿中平稳发展，这是很不容易的。这种情况足以说明，中国人民的绝大多数对党和政府是信任的和拥护的。这是因为，他们从亲身经历中体会到，新中国成立后的40年来，坚持社会主义道路，特别是这十年来集中力量进行现代化建设和改革开放，使国家逐步走向繁荣富强，取得了过去剥削制度下根本不能取得的成就，所以大家拥护共产党的领导，拥护社会主义制度。那种目的在于推翻共产党、颠覆社会主义制度的动乱和暴乱，是不得人心的。现在强调巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，就是要大家珍惜这种来之不易的局面，珍惜和保卫来之不易的社会主义建设成果。这决不意味着赵紫阳同志或者你们所谓的“赵紫阳一派”还有多么大的影响。当然，赵紫阳同志在任职期间支持、纵容资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，这种思想影响还没有完全消除。此外，有些动乱、暴乱分子还不会就此善罢甘休，有些罪犯尚未缉拿归案。这些不安定因素还是存在的，但也不应夸大它们。有一个事实可能很足以支持我所说的观点，这就是我们党召开的十三届四中全会决定撤销赵紫阳同志的职务时，到会同志全体一致通过。而且，各级党的组织直至基层组织，社会各个方面和各界人士，都通过各种渠道表示拥护这一决定。
    国际上想孤立中国是不可能的
    问：你对中国目前同西方国家主要是美国的关系，及其改善的前景有何评论？
    答：中美两国建交以来，两国关系中虽然也还存在一些这样那样的问题，但总的来说发展还是比较顺利的。最近两国关系中出现的问题，主要是因为对中国在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱过程中所采取的纯属解决一个国家内政问题的措施，西方一些国家主要是美国不仅不予理解，而且还采取了诸如对我国进行所谓“经济制裁”等粗暴干涉中国内政的错误立场。美国方面已表示这里头有受错误舆论导向的因素。因此，继续改善两国关系，克服目前存在的一些障碍或麻烦，美国方面应采取主动。只要美国放弃对中国内政的干涉，我们方面对改善两国关系不存在问题。
    中国的现代化经济建设主要依靠自力更生，同时也要争取外援，包括同西方发达国家发展经济贸易关系和技术合作。但是，这种事情不能一厢情愿，只能在双方平等互利的基础上进行。我个人认为，中国同西方国家包括同美国的关系，以及同它们之间的经济贸易往来，迟早总是要发展的。一个最重要的事实是，中国共产党的领导地位是巩固的，中国的政局是稳定的，共产党领导的拥有11亿人口的社会主义中国屹立在世界的东方，国际上谁也无法否定这个事实，想孤立中国是不可能的。
    至于说到对中国的所谓“经济制裁”，我们已注意到近来有所缓和，但远未取消，尚未恢复正常。对此，中国政府已多次表明过自己的态度：第一，我们不怕，中国决不会屈服于任何干涉我国内政的压力；第二，中国将坚持进行有理、有利、有节的斗争。当然，所谓“制裁”会对中国带来一些暂时困难，但也会激发中国人民自力更生、奋发图强，而且“制裁”对“制裁者”也会带来损害。
    对中日关系发展前景持乐观态度
    问：关于日中关系，你有什么希望？
    答：中日两国是一衣带水的邻邦。两国政府和人民都希望，我们两国能够世世代代友好下去，这符合两国人民的根本利益以及亚洲、世界人民的利益。我们两国恢复邦交后，两国友好合作关系有了较大的发展。现在也由于日本方面的原因而出现了一些不如人意的地方，但我们也注意到了日本的一些做法同西方有的大国还是有所不同，并表示了逐步改变的愿望。我希望，从历史的角度看问题，在两国的友好关系中，一些不愉快的情况只是一段插曲。说到希望，从政治上讲，希望两国在和平共处五项原则的基础上长期友好相处。从经济上讲，希望两国双边贸易进一步扩大，中国方面的贸易逆差进一步缩小；希望双方的资金合作协议继续得到执行；希望日本在技术转让方面少一些障碍，多一些开放。我对中日关系的发展前景也是乐观的。
    坚决反对台湾当局推行的“弹性外交”
    问：关于台湾当局的“弹性外交”有何评论？
    答：中华人民共和国是中国唯一的合法政府，台湾是中国神圣领土的一部分。我们的这个原则立场决不容许有任何改变，我们坚决反对任何导致台湾从祖国分裂出去的言论和行动。中国政府最近同格林纳达、利比里亚中止外交关系，再次表明了我们的这个庄严立场。台湾当局推行所谓的“弹性外交”，制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”，是不会有什么前途的，也是我们坚决反对的。我们将坚定不移地按照“一国两制”的构想，推进祖国和平统一大业。希望台湾当局顺乎历史的潮流，采取有利于祖国统一的明智决策。
    中国人民决不会好了伤疤忘了痛
    问：中国最近强调坚持四项基本原则，强调加强思想政治工作，这是否意味着又要回到“文化大革命”时期？
    答：我们党的基本路线是“一个中心，两个基本点”，就是以经济建设为中心，既坚持四项基本原则，又坚持改革开放。前个时期，由于坚持四项基本原则不得力，不一贯，思想政治工作遭到削弱，是不久前发生动乱、暴乱的主要国内原因。我们总结了这方面的经验教训，强调坚持四项基本原则和加强思想政治工作，也是为了把现代化建设和改革开放事业更好、更健康地向前推进，这同回到“文革”时期是根本不相干的两个概念。中国人民吃够了“文革”的苦头，决不会好了伤疤忘了痛。
