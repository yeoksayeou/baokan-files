Two prominent American evangelists, who claimed to spread the "gospel" of "God," were revealed to be fraudsters who deceived believers and embezzled funds. One of them is the president of the "Praise the Lord" Evangelistic Association, who recently stood trial in Charlotte, North Carolina. The other is the association's vice-president, who has already been imprisoned.

The president of the "Praise the Lord" television evangelistic association, Jimmy Bakker, was indicted on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, and is accused of misappropriating $3.7 million of the association's funds. If the federal district court jury confirms these charges, the 49-year-old Bakker could face 120 years in prison and a $5 million fine.

The prosecutor accused Bakker of using his preaching opportunities and the goodwill of his followers to amass wealth for his own extravagant lifestyle over the years. In its heyday, the association's annual income exceeded $100 million, and it broadcasted on 200 cable television stations. Recently, the association has been on the brink of bankruptcy, but Bakker concealed this fact from the public and continued to sell membership certificates at $1,000 each in large quantities. Since 1984, Bakker has used donations from his followers to purchase several Rolls-Royces and Mercedes-Benzes; he chartered private planes for trips with his wife; employed four servants at home, and even hired bodyguards for his young daughter.

Bakker's former personal secretary also confirmed that numerous properties, mink coats, and diamonds were purchased in Bakker's name to evade taxes. In 1987, Bakker was forced to resign due to a scandal involving an affair with a church secretary. The $260,000 he paid to this mistress reportedly came from the evangelistic association and other illicit sources.

The vice-president, Richard Dodge, was also indicted on similar charges and sentenced to eight years in prison and a $200,000 fine. Before his imprisonment, he admitted, "I have let God down."

    披着布道外衣的吸血鬼
    仓立德
    自称传播“上帝”福音的两位美国著名传教士，原来却是欺诈教徒、骗取钱财的吸血鬼。其中一人是“赞美上帝”布道会会长，最近在美国北卡罗来纳州夏洛特出庭受审，另一位是该会副会长，已锒铛入狱。
    以欺骗及阴谋罪受到起诉的“赞美上帝”电视布道会会长吉米·贝克被控犯有24项罪行，并私自占用370万美元的布道会款项。如果上述罪状由联邦地区法院陪审团确认，49岁的贝克可被判处120年徒刑和500万美元罚金。
    检察官在法庭上指控贝克数年来利用布道机会和教众的善良愿望聚敛钱财，供自己挥霍享受。在过去高峰年，这个布道会年收入达1亿多美元，并在200个闭路电视台布道。最近，该会已处于破产状态，但贝克向公众隐瞒实情，继续大量发售每份1000美元的“会员证”。自1984年以来，贝克用信徒的捐款为自己添置了数辆罗尔斯·罗伊斯、奔驰等名牌轿车；夫妇外出旅行要包租专机；家中雇了4位佣人，甚至幼女都有保镖。
    贝克前私人秘书还证实以贝克名义购买了大量住宅、貂皮大衣及钻石等物，以便逃税。贝克1987年曾因与一位教会女秘书的桃色丑闻而被迫辞职，他支付给这位情人的26万美元据说也来自布道会及其他不正当渠道。
    以相同罪名遭到起诉的副会长理查德·道奇已被判处8年徒刑及罚款20万美元。服刑前他自称“使上帝失望”。（本报华盛顿专电）
