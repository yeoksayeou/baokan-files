Known as the "cultural district," Xi'an's Beilin District has reformed its cultural market management system by implementing a "block-based, comprehensive management" approach. This has effectively promoted the healthy development of the cultural market and purified the cultural environment.

Beilin District is home to over 600 cultural and entertainment businesses of various levels and types. In the past, the "line-based" management system, where each business department operated independently without coordination, led to fragmented management. This allowed some vendors to sell low-level and obscene spiritual poisons without timely intervention.

In September 1985, Beilin District established the Cultural Market Management Committee, integrating various cultural business departments and propaganda, public security, industry and commerce, pricing, and urban management departments into a unified force. The committee formulated the "Provisional Regulations for Cultural Market Management," bringing management under a system of rules and regulations with penalties for violations. The district also established a team of full-time and part-time managers from various relevant departments and provided them with relevant business training and professional ethics education.

After implementing the "block-based, comprehensive management" approach, the chaotic management of the cultural market in the past has been rectified. Many previously unregulated and unhealthy performances, fortune-telling, and superstitions have been effectively stopped. Over the past four years, the district has cracked down on illegal operations, handling over 300 cases involving illegal vendors and seizing over 150,000 illegal publications and audio-visual products.

Comprehensive management has integrated cultural market management with the construction of civilized streets and civilized units. The Cultural Market Management Committee organizes cultural vendors by area to participate in competitions for contributing to the construction of civilized streets, fostering mutual supervision and mutual progress. The district has seen the emergence of 51 advanced collectives and 113 advanced individuals.

    以块为主　综合治理
    西安碑林区管好文化市场
    新华社西安10月5日电　（通讯员舟行）素有“文化区”之称的西安市碑林区，改革文化市场管理体制，实行“以块为主，综合治理”的管理办法，有效地促进了文化市场的健康发展，净化了文化生活环境。
    碑林区拥有各级各类文化娱乐经营单位600多家。过去由于实行“条条为主”的归口管理办法，业务部门各自为战，互不通气，管理分散，致使一些经营户兜售低级淫秽精神毒品的现象得不到及时遏止。
    1985年9月，碑林区成立区文化市场管理委员会，把各文化业务部门和宣传、公安、工商、物价、市容管理等部门结为一体，协同作战。区文管会制定了《文化市场管理试行规定》，把管理纳入有章可循、违章必究的轨道。全区还建立了一支由各有关方面人员参加的专、兼职管理队伍，并对管理人员进行有关业务培训，开展职业道德教育。
    实行“以块为主，综合治理”后，一改过去文化市场管理混乱的状况，许多无人管的、不健康的演出、算命卜卦等迷信活动得到有效制止。4年来，这个区狠抓打击处理非法经营活动，查处违法经营者300多人次，收缴各类违法出版物和音像制品15万件。
    综合治理使文化市场的管理与文明街道、文明单位的建设有机结合。文管会按地段将文化经营户组织起来，开展为建设文明街道作贡献竞赛，使之互相监督，互相促进。全区出现了51个先进集体和113名先进个人。
