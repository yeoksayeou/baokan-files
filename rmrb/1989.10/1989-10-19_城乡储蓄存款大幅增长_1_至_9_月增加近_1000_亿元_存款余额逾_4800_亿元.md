Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 18th.

Urban and rural residents' savings deposits in China have seen the largest growth rate in the 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic. From January to September this year, savings deposits increased by nearly 100 billion yuan. The balance of savings deposits has risen from 380.7 billion yuan at the end of last year to 480.6 billion yuan by September, an increase of 26%.

In the first half of the year, cash inflows and outflows resulted in a net withdrawal of 5.3 billion yuan, compared to a net injection of 8.8 billion yuan in the same period last year. The scale of credit has been controlled, and the loan structure has been initially adjusted.

Some economists believe that the shift from last year's large-scale bank runs to the current significant increase in savings, and from last year's large-scale currency issuance to this year's net withdrawal, indicates that China's economic rectification has been effective. This is a significant achievement in the implementation of austerity policies and the fight against inflation over the past year.

    城乡储蓄存款大幅增长
    1至9月增加近1000亿元
    存款余额逾4800亿元
    据新华社北京10月18日电（记者陈铭）中国城乡居民储蓄存款出现了建国40年来最大的增长幅度，今年1至9月增加近1000亿元；储蓄存款余额已从去年底的3807亿元上升到9月份的4806亿元，增长26％。
    上半年现金收支相抵净回笼53亿元，而去年同期为净投放88亿元。信贷规模得到控制，贷款结构初步得到调整。
    一些经济学家认为：从去年大规模的挤兑存款到目前储蓄的大幅度增长，从去年货币的大量投放到今年净回笼，这说明中国经济治理整顿已经奏效。这是实行紧缩方针、反通货膨胀一年来取得的显著成就。
