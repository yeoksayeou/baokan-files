	The year was 1986, and the street office in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, was still a "problem unit" with no funds in its accounts. In March 1987, under the worried gaze of the local residents, Cui Yurui and Zhao Huixing took over as the Party branch secretary and deputy director of the street office, respectively. After investigating, they identified the root causes of the long-standing issues in the street: severe housing shortages, with 502 households, 32 of which had three generations living together, and 146 households facing housing difficulties; a high number of unemployed residents, with 102 out of 691 people being unemployed; and significant difficulties in obtaining grain, with 97% of residents relying on the state's monthly ration of 26 pounds of grain. Determined to do something for the people, they decided to take action.

	By October of the previous year, just 20 months later, under the leadership of Cui Yurui and Zhao Huixing, the street office had accomplished five major tasks:

	1. Most of the 45 households with severe housing difficulties moved into new homes;
	2. The street's small factory was operated under a contract system, achieving remarkable economic benefits;
	3. The labor service company was established, arranging jobs for 62 unemployed individuals;
	4. The office raised funds to allocate an additional 8,000 pounds of grain and 1,000 pounds of cooking oil for the residents;
	5. The residents formed a mediation committee, which resolved 42 civil disputes. In 1988, the office was awarded the title of "Advanced Party Branch" by higher authorities.

　　干实事的街道办事处
    已是1986年，山西阳城县街道办事处仍是一个帐面无存款的“老大难”单位。1987年3月，党支部书记兼办事处主任崔毓瑞、副主任赵虎兴在街道市民的忧心忡忡中上任了。他们经过了解，理清了导致街道长期存在的问题：市民住房严重不足，全街道502户，三代同堂的32户，缺房和住房困难者146户；无业人口多，全街道691口人，无业人员达102人；市民吃粮困难大，97％的市民每月仅靠国家供应的26斤粮。为此，他们决心要为群众办实事。
    至去年10月，时仅20个月，在崔毓瑞、赵虎兴带领下，街道办事处办成了五件事情：
    一是45户住房特别困难户大部喜迁新居；二是街道小工厂实行承包经营，经济效益可观；三是劳动服务公司组建工作结束，安排无业人员62名；四是办事处自筹资金为市民调剂粮食8000余斤，食油1000余斤；五是市民们组成民调委员会，已调解民事纠纷42件，1988年上级授予办事处“先进党支部”光荣称号。
