Recently, the Pingluo County Land Management Bureau conducted an investigation and discovered that factories, mines, and farms are occupying large amounts of land but utilizing very little of it. For instance, the Dafeng Mine Farm was approved to occupy 486 mu (32.4 hectares) of land in 1986, but only 87 mu (5.8 hectares) has been used. The rest of the land remains idle, which is truly regrettable. Last year, the Dawukou Aluminum Alloy Factory expanded its plant area and illegally occupied 552 mu (33.5 hectares) of land, constructing a wall 1,112 meters long. Despite enclosing such a large area, the actual usable space is not significant. As a result, a considerable amount of arable land has been turned into wasteland.

　　占地多，利用少，应引起重视
　　宁夏银川市　罗耀杰　张顺喜
    最近，平罗县土地管理局调查发现，厂矿、农场占地多、利用少的现象很严重。例如大峰矿农场1986年经批准占地486亩，只使用87亩，其它土地至今闲着，实在可惜。去年，大武口铝合金厂扩建厂区，擅自占地552亩，圈筑围墙1112米，圈那么大的一个院子实际使用面积并不大，不少良田就这样人为地变成荒地。
