China's Representative Speaks at the UNGA in Support of the UN Conference on Environment and Development

NEW YORK, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Ding Yuanhong today at the 44th session of the United Nations General Assembly expressed support for the convening of the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, hoping that this conference would become a new milestone for the international community in its efforts to achieve continued development and improve the human environment.

Ding Yuanhong endorsed the proposal to hold the conference in a developing country, so that the international community would pay more attention to the environmental and development issues facing the vast majority of the world's population in developing countries. He also expressed China's support for Brazil's willingness to host the conference.

Ding Yuanhong also put forward five opinions on the objectives, scope, and content of the conference:

First, environmental issues and development issues should be considered as an organic whole, with economic development and environmental protection proceeding in a coordinated manner.

Second, an international economic environment conducive to the sustainable development of all countries should be established to fundamentally change the situation where developing countries are poor, underdeveloped, and unable to protect the environment.

Third, the main sources of environmental damage in the world today are industrialized developed countries, which bear the primary responsibility for addressing global environmental issues. They should take more concrete actions in terms of funding and technology transfer to help developing countries address their environmental protection challenges.

Fourth, environmental protection should not come at the expense of the development of developing countries, nor should it be used as a pretext to arbitrarily interfere with the development policies of developing countries or infringe upon their permanent sovereignty over natural resources.

Fifth, in the formulation of international regulations on environmental issues, there should be broad participation from all countries, especially developing countries, and full consideration of their special difficulties and needs.

　　我代表在联大发言
　　支持联合国召开环境与发展会议
    本报联合国10月23日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国代表丁原洪大使今天在第44届联合国大会上表示支持1992年召开联合国环境与发展会议，并希望这次会议成为国际社会争取继续发展、改善人类环境的一个新的里程碑。
    丁原洪赞成此会议在一个发展中国家举行，以便使国际社会更加重视占世界人口绝大多数的发展中国家所面临的环境和发展问题。他还表示中国支持巴西愿意担任会议东道国的建议。
    丁原洪还就会议的目标、范围和内容等提出五点意见：
    第一、环境问题和发展问题应作为一个有机联系的整体来考虑，经济发展与环境保护应同步协调进行；
    第二、要建立一个有利于各国持续发展的、公正的国际经济环境，才能从根本上改变发展中国家贫穷、不发达和无力保护环境的状况；
    第三、当今世界环境的损害主要源自工业化的发达国家，它们对治理全球环境负有主要责任，应在资金和技术转让方面采取更多的实际行动，帮助发展中国家解决面临的环境保护问题；
    第四、保护环境不能以牺牲发展中国家的发展为代价，更不能以保护环境为理由任意干涉发展中国家的发展政策和侵犯这些国家对其自然资源的永久主权；
    第五、在拟定有关环境问题的国际法规时，应由各国尤其是发展中国家广泛参加，充分顾及它们的特殊困难和需要。
