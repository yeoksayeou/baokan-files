Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, October 17th.

The United Arab Emirates team scored two goals in the final five minutes, defeating the Chinese football team 2-1 in a surprising turn of events.

The second round of the Asian qualifying matches for the World Cup continued today here, with China facing the UAE. After the start of the game, both teams had attacking opportunities. In the 63rd minute, China's number 8, Tang Yaodong, scored a goal from a long shot from the left side of the opponent's penalty area. With only five minutes left in the game, it seemed that China was on the verge of victory. However, the UAE team took advantage of two corner kicks and a personal breakaway, scoring two goals in quick succession to turn the game around.

Currently, all six participating teams have played two matches each. South Korea and the UAE have one win and one draw, each with 3 points; China has one win and one loss, Qatar has two draws, and both have 2 points; North Korea and Saudi Arabia have one draw and one loss, each with 1 point.
