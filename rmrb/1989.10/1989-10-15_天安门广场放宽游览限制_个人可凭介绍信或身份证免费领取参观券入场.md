Under the sun, in front of the flower beds, more and more visitors are coming to Tiananmen Square. Today, 8 photography services on the north side of the square have resumed operations and are busy.

Qiyu Xie, deputy director of the Tiananmen Management Office, said that starting from October 6, Tiananmen Square has eased tourist restrictions. Visitors and tourists are no longer required to be in groups of 10 or more. Groups of fewer than 10 people or individuals, who hold introduction letters from county, division, or bureau-level units, can go to the Meridian Gate in front of the Forbidden City's south gate to obtain free admission tickets. The visiting hours are from 8:30 AM to around 5:30 PM.

Foreigners, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, whether in groups or individually, can also obtain free admission tickets by presenting introduction letters from their receiving units or personal identification documents, press cards, or return visit permits.

The Mao Zedong Memorial Hall and the Great Hall of the People have also resumed operations.

Since October 6, the number of visitors to Tiananmen Square has reached over 10,000 per day, and over 20,000 on weekends.
