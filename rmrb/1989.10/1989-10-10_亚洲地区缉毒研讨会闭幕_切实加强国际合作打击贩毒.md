Representatives from 32 countries (regions) and relevant international organizations today in Beijing issued a joint appeal: in the spirit of safeguarding the common interests of the people in this region, the police and other law enforcement agencies in Asian countries (regions) should adopt a more proactive attitude and more effective measures in anti-drug cooperation, and promote this cooperation towards concrete and practical directions.

The five-day Asia-Pacific Anti-Drug Conference concluded today with the adoption of a summary and a statement. The conference chairman, Liu Wen, Director of the Chinese National Central Bureau of Interpol, said at today's press conference that due to the fact that drug crimes have become a major concern for the international community, this conference has received active responses from many countries. The number of countries and regions participating in the conference is rare in the history of similar conferences organized by Interpol.

In the more than 30 years since the founding of New China, China has been known as a drug-free country. In recent years, some overseas drug criminals have used China as a transit point for drug trafficking, which has been severely cracked down on. In 1987, the Chinese police busted 56 drug trafficking cases, seizing 137 kilograms of opium and 43 kilograms of heroin; in 1988, 268 drug trafficking cases were busted, seizing 239 kilograms of opium and 166 kilograms of heroin. So far this year, 187 drug trafficking cases have been busted, seizing 143 kilograms of opium and 141 kilograms of heroin. The representatives at this conference recognized that drug crimes have become an international scourge endangering human health and social stability. The concepts of drug-producing countries and transit countries have changed. The emergence of some drug abuse and trafficking cases in China's border areas is an example.

It is understood that at this conference, the Chinese delegation proposed a relatively detailed plan, which was appreciated by the attending representatives. The two documents, after absorbing the opinions of representatives from various countries, emphasized the urgency of strengthening international anti-drug cooperation. The contents include: actively promoting anti-drug legislation; strengthening the exchange of anti-drug intelligence; implementing bilateral or multilateral cooperation in handling drug trafficking cases with the approval of the governments under the laws of various countries (regions); mutual support among countries (regions) in anti-drug technology, equipment, funds, and moral support; establishing relatively stable cooperation mechanisms with relevant countries and regions based on the actual needs and possibilities of their own countries (regions).

It is noted that 80 years ago, in 1909, the first international anti-drug conference, which opened the way for international anti-drug efforts, was also held in China (Shanghai). Officials from the Interpol General Secretariat attending the conference believe that this conference has revitalized the spirit of the Shanghai Conference and will promote the development of anti-drug work in Asia and the world. Various countries' police forces believe that this conference once again demonstrated China's consistent stance on anti-drug efforts and its active spirit in promoting international anti-drug cooperation.

It is understood that at the conference in Vienna in December 1988 to discuss the "United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances," it was the Chinese delegation that first proposed to include Interpol as an international cooperation channel in the "New Convention." This is the first time that Interpol has been included in a global international convention.

### 亚洲地区缉毒研讨会闭幕  切实加强国际合作打击贩毒

    亚洲地区缉毒研讨会闭幕
    切实加强国际合作打击贩毒
    本报北京10月9日讯　记者张志业、王苏宁报道：来自32个国家（地区）和有关国际组织的代表，今天在北京一致发出呼吁：本着维护本地区人民共同利益的崇高愿望，亚洲各国（地区）警方和其他执法部门在缉毒合作上应采取更加积极的态度和更有效的措施，推动这种合作向具体、实用的方向发展。
    历时5天的亚洲地区缉毒研讨会，今天以产生纪要和倡议书而宣告胜利闭幕。会议主席、国际刑警组织中国国家中心局局长刘文在今天举行的新闻发布会上说，由于毒品犯罪已成为国际社会十分关注的课题，这次会议得到了许多国家的积极响应，参加会议的国家和地区之多，是国际刑警组织的同类会议少有的。
    新中国成立后的30多年时间里，中国曾以无毒国家称誉世界。近年来，一些境外毒品犯罪分子利用中国过境贩运毒品，已受到严厉打击。1987年，中国警方破获贩毒案56起，缴获鸦片137公斤、海洛因43公斤；1988年破获贩毒案268起，缴获鸦片239公斤，海洛因166公斤。今年以来，已破获贩毒案187起，缴获鸦片143公斤、海洛因141公斤。本次会议代表认识到，毒品犯罪已成为危害人类健康和社会安宁的国际性公害。毒品生产国、过境国的概念已发生变化。中国边境地区出现少数吸毒和贩毒现象，就是一个例证。
    据悉，在本次会议上，中国代表团提出了一个比较详细的方案，得到与会代表赞赏。吸收各国代表意见后的两个文件强调了加强缉毒国际合作的迫切性，其中内容包括：积极推进缉毒立法工作；加强缉毒情报交流；在各国（地区）法律的允许下，经政府批准，实施经办贩毒案件的双边或多边合作；各国（地区）在缉毒技术、装备、经费和道义上相互支援；从本国（地区）的实际需要和可能出发，同有关国家和地区建立比较稳定的合作制度。
    此间人士注意到，80年前，即1909年，作为开辟国际禁毒事业的第一次国际禁毒会议也是在中国（上海）举行的。与会的国际刑警总部的官员认为，这次会议再现了上海会议的精神，必将推动亚洲和世界禁毒工作的开展。各国警方认为，这次会议再次表明了中国政府始终不渝的缉毒立场和一贯致力于促进缉毒国际合作的积极精神。
    据悉，1988年12月在维也纳讨论《联合国禁止非法贩运麻醉药品和精神药物公约》的大会上，是中国代表团首先提出将国际刑警组织作为一种国际合作渠道写进《新公约》。这是国际刑警组织第一次被写进全球性国际公约。
