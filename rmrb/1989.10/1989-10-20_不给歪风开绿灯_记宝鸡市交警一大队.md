The First Traffic Police Brigade of Baoji City, which has been consecutively awarded the "Flying Red Flag" for urban traffic management in Shaanxi Province for two years, strictly manages its police force and has produced many exemplary cases of clean governance.

Last May, a "Blue Bird" sedan worth tens of thousands of yuan from a certain place in Henan Province collided with a motorcycle on Hongwen Road in Baoji City. Traffic police Xu Mengshi, upon checking the vehicle's documents, found that the car had no driving permit and immediately impounded the vehicle, requiring the owner to present the driving permit and other necessary documents. The owner of the "Blue Bird" came four times, each time without any documents, but busy with inviting the police to dine and offering gifts. Half a month later, a few people claiming to be from the Labor Service Company of the Sanmenxia Instrument and Meter Factory in Sanmenxia City approached the accident handling personnel, saying, "As long as you let our 'Blue Bird' go, we will not let you down," and immediately took out 40,000 yuan. Faced with the money, traffic police Xu Mengshi and Cao Zhujiang firmly stated: "Money cannot buy us off. Without legal documents, the car cannot leave." Those people embarrassingly said, "We didn't expect money to be useless here."

The Pingliang Transportation Company from Gansu Province has large transportation tasks in Baoji City every year. In the past, due to the unfamiliarity of out-of-town drivers with the city's traffic conditions, they often encountered problems such as vehicle impoundment and fines, which affected the completion of transportation tasks. Starting last year, the First Traffic Police Brigade of Baoji City, while strengthening the management of out-of-town vehicles entering the city, launched civilized law enforcement activities. The police of the First Brigade not only enthusiastically explained the traffic management rules to the drivers of the Pingliang Transportation Company who came to Baoji City for cargo transportation but also helped them solve problems, receiving praise from the drivers and cargo owners. To express their gratitude to the First Brigade police, in early April this year, the Pingliang Transportation Company sent 50 pieces of silk bedding. The brigade leader said: "Civilized law enforcement is what we police should insist on. We cannot accept this gift." They then found the brigade leader and repeatedly requested to accept the gift, but were politely declined.

In the construction of clean governance, this brigade clearly proposed: "Not even a pack of cigarettes or a meal can be accepted for free." The broad police force strictly followed this regulation. On a day in late March, traffic police Zhu Zhixiong handled a violation by an out-of-town truck and impounded the driver's license. The next day, the driver sent a pack of high-grade cigarettes through a driver familiar with Zhu Zhixiong. Zhu Zhixiong immediately criticized their wrongdoing and penalized the violator according to regulations.

Statistics show that since this year, the police of this brigade have refused to accept gifts and invitations nearly a hundred times, and received dozens of letters of commendation and banners.

    不给歪风开绿灯
    ——记宝鸡市交警一大队
    云献科
    连续两年被评为陕西省城市交通管理流动红旗优胜单位的宝鸡市交警一大队，从严治警，涌现出许多为警清廉的事迹。
    去年5月的一天，河南省某地一辆价值十几万元的“蓝鸟”牌小轿车，在宝鸡市宏文路与一辆摩托车相撞。交警徐梦石查验车证件时，发现该车无行驶证，即将车扣留，并责成车主出示行驶证等手续。“蓝鸟”的事主先后4次跑来，每次都不带任何证件，却忙着请客送礼。半月之后，又有几个自称是三门峡市量仪配件厂劳动服务公司的人，找到事故处理人员请求说：“只要能放行我们的‘蓝鸟’车，决不会亏待你们的”，当即拿出4万元人民币。在金钱面前，交警徐梦石和曹珠江明确表示：金钱打不通我们，若没有合法手续，车就开不走。”那几个人尴尬地说，想不到金钱在这里也不灵了。
    甘肃省平凉运输公司每年都在宝鸡市有大量运输任务，过去因外地司机对市区交通情况不熟而常常遇到扣车、罚款等麻烦，影响运输任务的完成。去年开始，宝鸡市交警一大队在加强对外地车辆进市区的管理中，开展了文明执勤活动。一中队的交警们不但热情地为平凉运输公司来宝鸡市区运货的司机讲解交通管理规则，而且还为他们排忧解难，受到司机和货主的赞扬。为了表示对一中队交警的酬谢，今年4月初，平凉运输公司派人送来了50条绸缎被面。中队领导说：文明执勤是我们交警应该坚持的，这礼品我们不能收。随后，他们又找到大队负责人，再三请求收下，还是被婉言谢绝。
    在廉政建设中，这个大队明确提出：一包烟一顿饭也不白吃。广大干警用实际行动执行这个规定。3月下旬的一天，交警朱志雄处理外地一辆大货车违章时，将其驾驶员执照扣留。第二天，这个驾驶员便托一位跟朱志雄熟悉的司机，送来一条高级香烟，朱志雄当场批评了他们的错误作法，对违章者按规定作了处罚。
    据统计，今年以来，这个大队干警共拒收礼品和吃请近百人次，收到数十件表扬信件和锦旗。
