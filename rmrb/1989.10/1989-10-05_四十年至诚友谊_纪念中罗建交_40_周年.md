October 5th marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Romania. On October 5th, 1949, the newly established People's Republic of China and Romania formally established diplomatic relations. Over the past 40 years, both China and Romania have undergone significant historical transformations, and the relationship between the two countries has seen tremendous development.

The friendship between China and Romania has deep historical roots. During World War II, the Communist Parties of both countries and their peoples supported each other. Outstanding sons of Romania traversed mountains and rivers to come to the battlefield of the Anti-Japanese War, fighting alongside the Chinese people against the invaders. Since the five-star red flag was raised over Tiananmen Square, the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Romania, with the establishment of diplomatic relations as a significant milestone, has seen a qualitative leap.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the relationship between China and Romania, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, has developed steadily and healthily in the fields of politics, economy, science and technology, and culture. The Chinese people will never forget that, whether in the difficult early years of the People's Republic of China or during the tumultuous international era, the Romanian Communist Party and people provided valuable support to the Chinese Communist Party and people. The friendly exchanges between the two peoples have never ceased; in times of need, we have extended our sincere hands to each other. The relationship established between the two parties and countries of China and Romania has withstood the test of numerous storms.

Over the past 40 years, leaders of the two parties and countries of China and Romania have frequently interacted. President Nicolae Ceaușescu and General Secretary have visited China six times, and Chinese party and government leaders have also visited Romania multiple times. The mutual visits and meetings of the leaders of the two countries, as well as the understandings reached, have laid a solid foundation for the comprehensive, sustained, and stable development of the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Romania. For many years, exchanges at various levels between the parties, governments, military, and people's organizations of the two countries have deepened mutual understanding.

The first cultural agreement, trade protocol, and scientific and technological cooperation agreement between China and Romania were signed in 1951, 1952, and 1953, respectively. In less than 40 years, economic exchanges between the two countries have grown nearly 190 times. The economic and trade relations between China and Romania, which include various forms such as accounting, barter, and production cooperation, have continuously developed, making important contributions to meeting the needs of the national economies and people's lives of the two countries, and promoting the economic and technological progress of the two countries. The long-term economic and technological cooperation agreement signed by the two countries until the year 2000 and the minutes of the 29th session of the China-Romania Science and Technology Cooperation Joint Committee have given new impetus to the future development of economic and technological relations between the two countries. The two countries have exchanged and learned from each other's experiences in various fields of socialist construction. The cooperation between China and Romania in the fields of culture and arts, education, and publishing has enriched the spiritual lives of the peoples of the two countries and cultivated the talents needed by the two countries. In international affairs, China and Romania have always supported each other and cooperated closely. Both countries pursue an independent foreign policy, adhere to the principles of respecting independence and sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs in international relations, and have made unremitting efforts to establish a new international political and economic order, strive for disarmament, and promote world peace.

The friendship and cooperation between the two parties and countries and the peoples of China and Romania, established in the long-term revolutionary struggle, are full of vitality. Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu said: "We highly value the long-standing, fruitful friendship and cooperation between China and Romania, which has been formed and developed over a long period of time, withstood the test of difficult international environments and historical vicissitudes, and has always shown its vitality." Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The long-term cooperative relationship between our two parties and countries is satisfactory to both sides. This cooperative relationship is not a general, superficial one, but is built on a good political foundation and deep emotional bonds. Therefore, this cooperation is sincere." The friendship between China and Romania, tested over 40 years, is like a towering pine tree, with deep roots and lush leaves, standing tall and unyielding through wind and frost.

    四十年至诚友谊
    ——纪念中罗建交40周年
    骆忆
    今年10月5日，是中罗建交40周年纪念日。1949年10月5日，新生的中华人民共和国与罗马尼亚正式建立外交关系。40年来，中罗两国都发生了具有历史意义的变革，中罗关系也有了巨大的发展。
    中罗友谊源远流长。早在二战期间，两国共产党和两国人民就相互声援，相互支持。罗马尼亚的优秀儿子跋山涉水，来到抗日战场，同中国人民一起抗击侵略者。自从天安门广场升起五星红旗，以中罗建交为重要里程碑的中罗友好合作关系有了质的飞跃。
    建交后，建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的中罗关系，在政治、经济、科技、文化等各个领域都获得了持续、健康的发展。中国人民不会忘记，无论在中华人民共和国刚刚成立的艰苦岁月，还是在国际风云迭起的年代，罗马尼亚共产党和人民给予了中国共产党和人民以宝贵的支持，两国人民的友好往来从未中断；在两国人民最需要的时刻，我们相互伸出了真诚的手。中罗两党两国建立的这种关系不止一次经受住了狂风暴雨的考验。
    40年来，中罗两党两国领导人频繁接触。齐奥塞斯库总统、总书记先后6次访问中国，中国党政领导人也多次访问罗马尼亚。两国领导人互访、会晤及所达成的谅解，为中罗友好合作关系全面、持久、稳定的发展奠定了坚实基础。多年来，中罗党政军及人民团体各层次的交往，不断加深了相互了解。
    中罗第一个文化协定、贸易议定书和科技合作协定分别于1951、1952和1953年签订。不到40年时间，中罗经济往来增长了近190倍。具有记帐、易货、生产合作等多种形式的中罗经贸关系不断发展，为满足两国国民经济和人民生活的需要，促进两国的经济和科技进步做出了重要贡献。两国近期签署的至2000年的经济科技长期合作协定和第29届中罗科技合作混委会会议议定书，对中罗经贸科技关系未来的发展又给予新的推动。两国在社会主义建设各个领域取得的经验，相互交流，彼此借鉴。中罗在文化艺术、教育、出版等方面进行的合作，丰富了两国人民的精神生活，培养了两国需要的人材。在国际事务中，中罗两国一向相互支持，密切合作。两国都奉行独立自主的外交政策，坚持尊重独立主权、平等互利、互不干涉内政的国际关系准则，为建立国际政治和经济新秩序，争取裁军与世界和平做出了不懈努力。
    在长期革命斗争中建立的中罗两党两国和两国人民之间的友谊与合作是富有生命力的。齐奥塞斯库同志说：“我们高度评价具有悠久、美好传统的、富有成果的中罗友好合作关系，它是在长期过程中形成发展起来的，经受了困难的国际环境和历史的考验，一直表现出它的生命力”。邓小平同志指出：“我们两党、两国多年合作关系，彼此都是满意的。这种合作关系不是一般泛泛的合作关系，而是建筑在良好的政治和深厚的思想感情基础上的合作。因此，这种合作是真诚的”。经过40年考验的中罗友谊如参天松柏，根深叶茂，历经风霜而愈益挺拔。
