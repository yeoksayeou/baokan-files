This Cannot Be a Reason for Disciplinary Action

In recent years, some individuals have started to "compare" when it comes to disciplinary issues. Listen to how some party members and cadres talk about issues like abusing power for personal gain: “If he can do it, why can’t I?” “There are so many people, what can they do to me?” “First, deal with them, then come for me!” Why does this strange phenomenon occur?

In the past few years, while some regions have loudly called for rectifying party style and discipline, often the thunder is loud but the rain is light. In dealing with disciplinary issues, there are those who indulge and tolerate, those who avoid the heavy issues and focus on the light ones, and those who protect each other. Party discipline has lost its due restraint, and those who violate discipline have become fearless, making the phenomenon of "comparison" not surprising.

I believe that when others violate discipline, one should take it as a warning, not as an opportunity to "compare" and follow suit. To eliminate the phenomenon of "comparison" in disciplinary issues, the most important thing is to strictly enforce party discipline and the law. For disciplinary actions and corrupt practices, one should investigate and deal with each case discovered; catch and punish each one found. Truly achieve: equality before the law. This way, it can deter the perpetrators, awaken those who follow, educate the masses, and make those who want to "compare" unable to do so and dare not do so.

    这岂能成为违纪理由
    近些年来，有些人竟在违纪问题上“攀比”起来。请听一些党员干部在对待以权谋私等违纪问题时的口气：“他能，我就不能？”“反正人多呢，能把我怎么样？”“先把他们管好了，再来管我！”为何会出现这种怪现象呢？
    前些年，有的地区整顿党风党纪虽然喊得不轻，但往往是雷声大雨点小。对违纪问题的处理，姑息迁就者有之，避重就轻、大题小做者有之，官官相安、官官相护者也有之，党的纪律失去了应有的约束力，违纪的人有恃无恐，出现“攀比”的现象也就不足为奇了。
    我认为，别人违纪了，自己要引以为戒，而不是“攀比”一番，跟着干。要消除违纪问题上的“攀比”现象，最重要的是严肃党纪、国法。对违纪行为、腐败现象，应当发现一个，查处一个；抓住一个，惩治一个。真正做到：法律面前人人平等。这样，就可以惩戒当事人，惊醒后来者，教育广大群众，就使得一些想“攀比”的人无法攀，不敢比。　江苏淮安市广播站　朱建强
