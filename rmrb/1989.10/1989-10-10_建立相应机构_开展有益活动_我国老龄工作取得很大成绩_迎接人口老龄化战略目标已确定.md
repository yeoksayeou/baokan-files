According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 9 (reporter Liu Siyang) Wang Zhaohua, chairman of the China National Committee on Aging, said at the second national conference on aging work that China has made significant achievements in aging work, which has played a good role in changing social customs, consolidating a stable and united situation, and implementing reform and opening up.

It is reported that since the establishment of the China National Committee on Aging in 1983, 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, 95% of prefectures and cities, and 70% of counties across the country have established aging committees. The central government and many local governments have also established various types of elderly organizations based on the characteristics of the elderly.

When discussing the issue of "having something to do in old age," Wang Zhaohua said that various levels of aging committees, in cooperation with relevant departments, actively organize the elderly to participate in social development. Practice has proven that in the process of reform and opening up and the construction of the two civilizations, the elderly are a valuable asset to society and an irreplaceable force.

It is reported that China currently has over 91 million elderly people aged 60 and above, accounting for approximately 8.5% of the total population. It is predicted that by the end of the century, China's elderly population will reach 130 million, accounting for more than 10% of the total population. According to the United Nations standards, China will enter an aging society.

Wang Zhaohua emphasized that in dealing with and solving problems related to aging work, one can only adapt to the development of the situation and take active measures in a timely manner. To this end, Wang Zhaohua urged aging workers at all levels to boost their spirits, take the initiative, and strive to achieve the following strategic goals through the joint efforts of all regions and relevant departments: initially establish a social old-age security system suitable for China's national conditions; establish an elderly service network centered on the community; formulate national laws or regulations to protect the rights of the elderly; establish a high-level aging research team and propose comprehensive strategies to address aging issues; establish and improve the aging work system; and strive to create conditions and environments suitable for an aging society.

    建立相应机构　开展有益活动
    我国老龄工作取得很大成绩
    迎接人口老龄化战略目标已确定
    据新华社北京10月9日电（记者刘思扬）中国老龄问题全国委员会主任王照华今天在第二次全国老龄工作会议上说，我国老龄工作取得很大成绩，对社会风气的转变，安定团结局面的巩固，改革开放的贯彻落实起到了很好的作用。
    据介绍，自1983年中国老龄问题全国委员会成立以来，全国已有28个省、自治区、直辖市，95％的地、市，70％的县建立了老龄委员会。中央和许多地方还根据老年人的特点，成立了各种类型的老年群众组织。
    谈到“老有所为”问题时，王照华说，各级老龄委员会配合有关部门，积极组织老年人参与社会发展。实践证明，在改革开放和两个文明建设中，老年人是社会的宝贵财富，是一支不可忽视的力量。
    据介绍，我国60岁以上的老年人现有9100多万，约占总人口的8.5％。预测本世纪末，我国老年人口将达1.3亿，占总人口的10％以上，按照联合国规定的标准，我国开始进入老龄化社会。
    王照华强调，在处理和解决与老龄工作有关的问题上，只能顺应形势的发展，及时采取积极的对策。为此，王照华要求各级老龄工作者振奋精神，积极进取，经过各地区、各有关部门的共同奋斗，力争实现这样的战略目标：初步建立符合我国国情的社会养老保障制度；建立以社区为中心的老年服务网络；制定国家维护老年人权益的法律或法规；建立一支具有较高水平的老龄科研队伍，提出对付老龄问题的综合对策；建立和完善老龄工作体系；努力创造一个适应人口老龄化社会的条件与环境。
