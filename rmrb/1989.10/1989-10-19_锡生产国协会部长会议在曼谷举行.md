A two-day meeting of the Council of Tin Producing Countries' Ministers began today in Bangkok. The purpose of this meeting is to reach an agreement on the continuation of the reasonable supply plan.

According to the reasonable supply plan, member countries of the Council of Tin Producing Countries should limit their annual tin exports within a quota. The first tin export quota of the Council was reached in Jakarta in 1986 due to the tin export crisis in 1985.

In his opening speech, Banhan Xibaacha, Minister of Industry of Thailand and Chairman of the Seventh Meeting of the Council of Tin Producing Countries, said that due to the instability of the world market and other factors, the reasonable supply plan should continue to be implemented.

Banhan also called on Brazil and China to join the Council of Tin Producing Countries in his post-meeting talk with reporters.

The Chinese representative, attending the meeting as an observer, expressed China's willingness to cooperate with the reasonable supply plan of the Council of Tin Producing Countries.

Vincent Fialho, Minister of Coal and Energy of Brazil, said that whether Brazil will join the Council of Tin Producing Countries needs at least two years of consideration. However, he assured that Brazil will cooperate with the Council of Tin Producing Countries in the reasonable supply plan.

The member countries participating in the Seventh Meeting of the Council of Tin Producing Countries' Ministers are: Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Thailand. Representatives from Brazil, China, and Myanmar attended the meeting as observers.

The Council of Tin Producing Countries' Ministers Meeting today agreed to continue implementing the reasonable supply plan. This fourth phase of the reasonable supply plan will be implemented until the end of December 1990.

The two-day Seventh Meeting of the Council of Tin Producing Countries' Ministers concluded this afternoon in Bangkok. According to the post-meeting news release, the total export quota and individual export quotas for member countries of the Council of Tin Producing Countries during the fourth phase of the reasonable supply plan will be decided at the next meeting of the Council of Tin Producing Countries' Executive Committee to be held in Kuala Lumpur in January 1990.

The member countries of the Council of Tin Producing Countries believe that the continuation of the reasonable supply plan in 1990 will help normalize tin production, which will aid in consolidating the world tin industry and stabilizing the supply and demand in the tin market.

The next meeting of the Council of Tin Producing Countries' Ministers will be held in Bolivia in September 1990.

    锡生产国协会部长会议在曼谷举行
    新华社曼谷10月16日电  为期两天的锡生产国协会部长会议今天在这里开始举行。这次会议的目的是为达成一项关于继续实行合理供给计划的协定。
    根据合理供给计划，锡生产国协会的成员国锡年出口量应在限额以内。协会的第1个锡出口限额是由于1985年锡出口危机而于1986年在雅加达达成的。
    泰国工业部长、锡生产国协会第七次会议主席班汉·西巴阿差在会议的开幕词中说，由于世界市场的不稳定及其他因素，合理供给计划应该继续实行。
    班汉在会后对记者的谈话中还呼吁巴西和中国参加锡生产国协会。
    作为观察员出席会议的中国代表表示，中国愿意与锡生产国协会合理供给计划进行合作。
    巴西煤炭和能源部长维森特·菲亚略说，巴西是否加入锡生产国协会，至少需要考虑两年。但是，他保证巴西将在合理供给计划方面与锡生产国协会合作。
    参加这次锡生产国协会部长会议第七次会议的各成员国是：澳大利亚、玻利维亚、印度尼西亚、马来西亚、尼日利亚和泰国。巴西、中国和缅甸的代表作为观察员参加会议。
    新华社曼谷10月17日电  锡生产国协会部长会议今天表示同意继续实行合理供给计划。这个第四期合理供给计划将实行到1990年12月底。
    为期两天的锡生产国协会部长会议第七次会议是于今天下午在曼谷结束的。据会后的新闻公报说，对锡生产国协会的成员国在第四期合理供给计划中的总出口限额和个别出口限额，将由在1990年1月于吉隆坡举行的下届锡生产国协会执行委员会会议决定。
    锡生产国协会的各成员国相信，合理供给计划在1990年期间的继续实行，会促使锡生产趋于正常，这将有助于巩固世界锡工业，并且稳定锡市场上的供求双方。
    下届锡生产国协会部长会议将于1990年9月在玻利维亚举行。
