Over the past few decades, North Korea's cultural and educational undertakings have undergone profound changes. During our recent visit to North Korea, we witnessed and experienced this transformation firsthand, leaving a deep impression. The pride of a school principal

The Moranbong Girls' Middle School in Pyongyang is an outstanding school. The school has 1,850 students and over 120 staff members. In addition to more than 60 classrooms, there are 26 well-equipped laboratories and workshops, a 600-seat auditorium, and a gymnasium.

Principal Kim Du-seong introduced to us that in the 1950s, North Korea began implementing compulsory primary education. By 1975, it had implemented 11 years of compulsory education, with the state covering all tuition and uniform fees for students during their middle school years. In North Korea, middle school teachers must graduate from a normal university. Compared to other professions of the same level, their compensation is also relatively generous. This principal, who has been awarded the title of Hero of Labor in North Korea, spoke excitedly about his profession, "After graduating from university, I worked in youth work for a few years and became a teacher at the age of 28. It has been 30 years now. Many of our graduates have received honors such as Hero of the Republic and People's Artist. Last year, the college entrance examination admission rate for the graduating class reached 70%. Parents are very happy to have their children attend our school. I love my profession and am proud of it!"

A Hall of Learning

The People's Study Hall, located on Nam Hill in the center of Pyongyang (see the cover photo), is known as an important base for the intellectualization of the entire society. It houses 30 million books, serves an average of 6,000 visitors per day, and has a total building area of 100,000 square meters. In addition to book lending counters and reading rooms for various disciplines, there are four "question and answer rooms" staffed by 250 scholars to answer questions.

The People's Study Hall serves both as a public library and as a venue for social education, reflecting the combination of general education and vocational education in North Korea's educational system. It has various multimedia classrooms and offers full-time and part-time courses. The staff member who led us on the tour introduced that the Cabinet has stipulated that every Tuesday afternoon, the ministers of various departments must come here to study, and some of the country's top leaders also often participate in the study sessions. The People's Study Hall has a "Attendance Department" specifically responsible for the attendance of leaders at the ministerial level and above. Regular lectures are also held here, and officials at the bureau and division levels must attend.

North Korea's vocational education and continuing education can form a social atmosphere, which is inseparable from the strong promotion and leadership of the Party and the government, as well as the leading role of leaders.

Rich and Diverse Cultural and Sports Activities

Pyongyang has four large stadiums with capacities of around 100,000 seats. During our visit, we had the opportunity to watch the reenactment of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 13th World Youth Festival, which had just ended, including the mass gymnastics and large-scale performances, at the "May Day" Stadium, which can accommodate 150,000 spectators.

On important holidays or major events, some cities in North Korea organize large-scale mass gymnastics. Mass gymnastics not only have profound political and ideological content but also demonstrate excellent athletic skills, high artistic quality, and organizational discipline. The government attaches great importance to organizing mass gymnastics as an activity to educate the people, boost spirits, and improve the physical fitness of the entire population.

Various cultural facilities occupy a significant position in the urban construction of Pyongyang. For example, the People's Cultural Palace with a building area of over 60,000 square meters; a gymnasium with 500 seats, a theater with 1,100 seats, and a youth palace with over 500 rooms; the "February 8" Cultural House, with a total building area of 80,000 square meters, two large theaters, and a focus on ideological and cultural education for soldiers; as well as the famous Mansudae Art Theater, Pyongyang Grand Theater, and Circus. These cultural facilities provide ample opportunities for learning, entertainment, and physical exercise for the more than 2 million people in Pyongyang. When we asked about the economic benefits of these facilities, the translator from the Rodong Sinmun, Old Choi, who accompanied us, said that the government considers social benefits and long-term benefits, aiming to enrich the lives of the people.

The Party and government of North Korea have always attached great importance to cultural and educational undertakings, which undoubtedly serve as a great driving force for social development.

    社会发展的巨大动力
    ——朝鲜文化、教育事业印象
    李春雷　谢隆灿
    几十年来，朝鲜文化教育事业发生了深刻的变化。我们在最近访朝期间耳闻目睹了这一巨变，印象深刻。一位中学校长的自豪　平壤牡丹峰女子中学是一所拔尖的学校。该校有一千八百五十名学生，一百二十多名教工。除六十多间教室外，还有二十六个设备齐全的各类实习、试验室，六百个座位的礼堂和体育馆。
    校长金斗成向我们介绍说，五十年代，朝鲜开始实行初等义务教育，到了一九七五年便实行十一年义务教育，学生上中小学期间的学费、校服费等全部由国家负担。在朝鲜，中学教师必须从师范大学毕业。同其它职业同类级别相比，待遇也较优厚。这位荣获朝鲜劳动英雄称号的校长谈到他的职业时，兴奋之情溢于言表，“我大学毕业后做了几年青年工作，二十八岁当教师，已整三十个年头了。我们学校的毕业生中，不少人获得了共和国劳动英雄、人民艺术家等荣誉称号。去年，毕业班高考录取率达百分之七十，孩子能上我们的学校，家长们都很高兴。我爱我的职业，为我的职业自豪！”学习知识的殿堂
　坐落于平壤市中心南山岗上的人民大学习堂（见题图），被称作全社会知识分子化的重要基地。这里藏书三千万册，平均日接待六千人次，总建筑面积达十万平方米。除各学科的图书借阅台、阅览室外，还设四个“问答室”，由二百五十名学者负责答疑。
    人民大学习堂既是公共图书馆，又兼作社会教育场所，这体现了朝鲜教育体系中普通教育和职业教育结合的特点。这里有各种电化教室，开设各类脱产、半脱产班。带领我们参观的工作人员介绍，政务院规定，每星期二下午，各部部长要来这里学习，国家一些主要领导人也常常参加学习。人民大学习堂设有“出勤部”，专门负责部长以上领导人的学习考勤。在这里还举办定期讲座，有关局处级干部也必须参加。朝鲜的职业教育和业余学习能形成一种社会风气，与党和政府的大力提倡、领导人的带头是分不开的。文体活动丰富多采　平壤有四个十万左右座位的大型体育场。访问期间，适逢第十三届世青联欢节结束不久，我们有幸在可容纳十五万观众的“五·一”体育场观看了重演的联欢节开幕、闭幕式上的文艺节目和大型团体操。
    朝鲜的一些城市逢重要节日或重大活动，都要组织大型团体操。团体操既有深刻的政治思想内容，又表现了良好的体育技术、高度的艺术性和组织纪律性。政府把组织团体操作为教育人民、振奋精神、提高全民体育素质的活动而予以十分重视。
      各种文化设施在平壤的城市建设中，占有相当重要的位置。如建筑面积六万多平方米的人民文化宫；带有五百个座位的体育馆、一千一百个座位的剧场、五百多个房间的少年宫；总建筑面积八万平方米、带有两个大型剧场、侧重于对军人进行思想、文化教育的“二·八”文化会馆，还有著名的万寿台艺术剧场、平壤大剧场、杂技院等。这些文化设施为二百多万平壤人民提供了充分的学习、娱乐和体育锻炼的场所。当我们问到这些设施的经济效益时，陪同我们的朝鲜《劳动新闻》的翻译老崔说，政府考虑的是社会效益和长远效益，是为了丰富人民的生活。
    朝鲜党和政府一贯重视文化教育事业，无疑这是推动社会发展的一种巨大动力。
