The Harm of Superstition

In a recent period, I investigated the situation regarding witch doctors and feudal superstitions in some counties and cities in Shashi and Jingzhou, Hubei Province, and also conducted surveys in more than 10 provinces and cities. I found that the prevalence of witch doctors and various superstitions is much more serious than people imagine.

Forms of Superstition Activities – From Hidden to Open

The witch doctors and superstition activities in Shashi and Jingzhou can be divided into three stages: from the 1960s to the early 1970s, superstitious activities were carried out in extremely covert forms. From the end of 1976 to 1980, superstitious activities became semi-public, specifically manifested in the continuous spread of rumors promoting superstitions, the appearance of fortune-tellers, the increasing number of people openly seeking "miracle water" and "holy water," the rise in the number of witch doctors, and the trend of raising funds to build temples. After 1984, various superstitious activities have become completely public. Fortune-tellers and palm readers openly set up stalls in urban and rural areas, including large cities, and even set up points at the gates of party and government agencies; illegally published superstition books and magazines are openly sold in bookstalls and street stalls in large and medium-sized cities; various superstition items are openly sold; various sects openly gather crowds to "hold meetings"; various feudal continuation of ancestral worship and other clan activities are openly restored; the use of superstition methods to hold funerals has become increasingly common. It is particularly worth noting that almost all of the above activities have the support and participation of some local leaders and party members.

Witch doctors and various superstition activities are not just isolated phenomena in certain regions or among certain individuals or certain levels of people. The investigation shows that witch doctors and various superstition activities are quite active in the vast rural and urban areas of the country. Those seeking help from witch doctors are no longer just low-educated farmers; people of various occupations are involved, and a few cadres and intellectuals also seek witch doctors to "treat" their relatives' illnesses.

Consequences of Superstition Activities – Corrupting and Harming People

Superstition activities endanger social order and disrupt production. In the "Yao Chi Holy Land" incident in Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, the croaking of frogs during mating was interpreted as seven immortals descending to earth to treat diseases, attracting two to three thousand people in three days. The male shamans took the opportunity to collect "invitation fees." In one month, more than 260 families had their houses stripped, more than 100 families suffered economic losses leading to family disputes, and more than 100 women were molested. During the Qingming Festival, Spring Festival, and the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, collective superstition activities in various places are even more prominent.

The open activities of various feudal sects in different places seriously disrupt social stability and unity. For example, in a certain county in Jiangsu Province, a farmer and his son created a so-called "Divine Gate Sect," developing more than 3,000 followers in nearby areas, claiming to be the Buddha and the Heavenly Emperor, and proclaiming that practicing the sect can lead to immortality and enlightenment, and entering the sect can cure diseases. They collected nearly 10 types of entrance fees and molested 14 women. In some places in our province, disputes over "auspicious burial sites" even led to large-scale fights. In Huanshan Village, Zhonghe Township, Dazhu County, Sichuan Province, a farmer whose zodiac sign is rabbit tortured his son, whose zodiac sign is tiger, to death. In Zhoushi Village, Tongzi County, Guizhou Province, a farmer, believing the fortune-teller's words that "only after your father dies will your family prosper," poisoned his stepfather.

Superstition ideas corrupt party members and cadres, weakening party and government leadership. In some places, various superstition activities also have the support, assistance, and participation of local party members and cadres. For example, the husbands of some female shamans are party members and cadres in the village, who either act as assistants to the female shamans or simply collaborate with them. In Maojie, Hanchang, Xiantao City, Hubei Province, several party members and cadres, believing the rumors of a female shaman, publicly convened a meeting, asking each household to contribute money to let the female shaman worship gods and perform rituals to develop followers. In Xiangyang County, Hunan Province, Xinyi County, Guangdong Province, and Tongcheng County, Hubei Province, some village party members and cadres act as clan leaders, leading the construction of ancestral halls; some clans openly declare that those who violate clan rules will be buried alive; some "Ancestral Hall Committees" openly do not follow the leadership of the village committee. In Chaoling County, Hunan Province, 11.4% of the party members and cadres participated in the construction of ancestral halls. Party members and cadres participating in and leading various superstition activities make superstition activities legal, having a corrupting effect.

Witch doctors, witchcraft, and superstition ideas harm lives. For example, in Zhanggou, Xiantao City, Hubei Province, a witch doctor took a mentally ill patient, Zhao, who had shown significant improvement in the hospital, back home and steamed him to death. In Yiyang, Hunan Province, a female shaman, Zhou Yumei, claimed that a 16-year-old girl, Xu, was a "frog spirit," and strangled the girl to death. In Shishou, Hubei Province, a female shaman, Zheng Ruanzhen, burned a female epilepsy patient to death.

Reasons for Superstition Activities – Management Mistakes

Why have witch doctors and various superstition activities become active again in the 1980s? I believe: superstition activities have undergone thousands of years of evolution and are deeply rooted in some people. Although superstition and religion have clear differences, they also penetrate each other. In the context of advocating religious freedom, the long-term existence of superstition ideas is inevitable. At the same time, for a considerable period, the lack of medical care and medicines in rural and remote areas of China is difficult to fundamentally change, leaving room for witch doctors to operate. Management mistakes are also an important reason. Currently, the administrative management and ideological education of superstition activities are overly lax, allowing various superstition activities to rapidly expand.

    神鬼之害
    前一时期，我曾调查了湖北沙市市和荆州地区的一些县、市有关巫医和封建迷信的情况，还曾到10多个省、市作过考察，发现巫医和各种迷信活动的猖獗程度比人们想象的要严重得多。
    迷信活动形式——由隐蔽转为公开
    沙市和荆州地区的巫医和迷信活动可以分为3个阶段：60年代至70年代初期，迷信活动都在极隐蔽的形式下活动。1976年年底至1980年，迷信活动转变为半公开，具体表现为宣扬迷信观念的谣言不断，算命先生开始出现，公开求“仙水”、“神水”等活动增多，巫医增多，刮起了集资修建庙宇风。1984年以后，各种迷信活动已完全公开化。算命的、看相的在城乡包括大城市公开扬帜摆摊，甚至在党政机关的大门口设点；非法出版的各类迷信书刊在大中城市一些书摊、地摊上公开出售；各类迷信用品公开销售；各种会道门公开聚众“做会”；各种封建性的续宗祭祖及其它宗族活动公开恢复；用迷信办法大办丧事的越来越普遍。需要特别指明的是，上述各种活动几乎都有当地一些领导人和党员的支持、参与。
    巫医及各种迷信活动已不是个别地区的个别现象，也不是个别人或个别层次人群中的个别现象。调查表明，全国广大农村城镇巫医和各种迷信活动相当活跃。求助巫医者已不只是低文化的农民，各种职业的人都有，少数干部和知识分子也有求巫医为他们的亲属“治病”的。
    迷信活动的后果——腐蚀人、残害人
    迷信活动危害社会治安，破坏生产。江苏射阳县境内的“瑶池圣地”事件，把青蛙求偶的鸣声解释为7个大仙降凡治病，三天之内聚集了两三千人，巫觋（男巫师）乘机收“请仙费”。一月之内，260多家扒房，100多家因经济损失致家庭不和，100多名妇女受到猥亵。清明、春节，农历初一、十五，各地各种集体迷信活动更为突出。
    各地的封建会道门公开活动，严重地破坏了社会的安定团结。如江苏某县农民父子创所谓“神门道”，在邻近地区发展道徒3000多人，自称佛祖、天皇神，宣称修道能成仙成佛，入道能治病，收取近10种入道费，猥亵奸污妇女14人。我省一些地方因争“风水宝地”，竟然发生大规模械斗。四川大竹县中和乡环山村一农民属兔，将属虎的儿子折磨死；贵州桐梓县周市村一农民听信算命先生“只有你父亲死了你家才能富起来”的话，毒死了他的继父。
    迷信观念腐蚀党员和干部，削弱党政领导。一些地方各种迷信活动也有当地党员、干部的支持、协助和参与。如有的女巫的丈夫是村里的党员干部，他们或充当女巫的助手，或干脆合伙行动。湖北仙桃市毛咀韩场几个党员干部听信女巫的谣言，居然公开召集会议，叫各家各户出钱，让女巫供神作法发展会众。湖南湘乡县、广东信宜县、湖北通城县某些乡村党员干部以宗族头目自居，领导修建祠堂；有的宗族公开声称对违犯族规者要处以活埋；有的“祠堂委员会”公开不服从村委会领导。湖南茶陵县参与修建祠堂的党员干部占总人数11.4％。党员干部参与、领导各种迷信活动，使迷信活动合法化，起了腐蚀作用。
    巫医巫术及迷信观念残害人命。如湖北仙桃市张沟一巫医把在医院治疗已有明显好转的精神病人赵某从医院接回家活活蒸死；湖南益阳女巫周玉梅说一位16岁的女孩徐某是“青蛙精”，将女孩活活勒死；湖北石首女巫郑阮珍将一女性癫痫病人烧死。
    迷信活动的原因——社会管理失误
    为什么巫医和各类迷信活动在80年代又重新活跃起来？我认为：迷信活动经过了数千年的演变，在一部分人中是根深蒂固的。迷信和宗教虽有明显区别但又互相渗透。在提倡宗教信仰自由的情况下，迷信观念的长期存在是不可避免的。同时，在相当长的一段时期内，我国农村和边远地区缺医少药状况难以根本改变，这给巫医活动留下了空隙。社会管理的失误也是一个重要原因。现在，对迷信活动在行政管理和思想教育上显得过分宽松，使得各类迷信活动迅速膨胀。
