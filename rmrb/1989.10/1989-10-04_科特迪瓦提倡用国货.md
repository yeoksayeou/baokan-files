Recently, the reporter observed that whether in Abidjan or in the supermarkets of Yamoussoukro, or in rural markets, products labeled "Made in Côte d'Ivoire" are gradually increasing. Sometimes, salespeople with megaphones tirelessly promote local products to customers, explaining how these new local products are both high-quality and affordable, even offering free samples for customers to try. Exhibitions and trade fairs featuring locally produced goods are held almost every year. Slogans such as "Buy Domestic Goods" and "Purchase Domestic, Export Domestic" frequently appear in newspapers. As more locally produced goods enter the market, their quality is continuously improving. This indicates that the consumption habits of the people of Côte d'Ivoire are undergoing profound changes.

Côte d'Ivoire is famous as the "Cocoa Kingdom," with its cocoa production ranking first in the world. However, in the past, the chocolate that Côte d'Ivoirians ate was mainly imported from Europe. These "imported goods" were not only expensive but also difficult to store due to the local humid and hot climate. Nowadays, there are more than 20 chocolate and confectionery factories in Abidjan, and their products have partially captured the Côte d'Ivoire market. Chocolate candies, chocolate sauce, chocolate powder, and chocolate pastries are all available.

Previously, Côte d'Ivoire imported 500,000 tons of dairy products annually, but now two-thirds of these dairy products are produced domestically. In recent years, a pharmaceutical factory has been built in Abidjan, and six commonly used medicines produced there have started to hit the market. This factory, in addition to having foreign capital, also has 150 local pharmacy owners as shareholders. Côte d'Ivoire is the main producer of airline meals in West Africa, supplying nearly 10,000 meals daily to 17 domestic and foreign airlines. Côte d'Ivoire's Nestlé coffee is well-known worldwide and is exported to many countries. The new investment law encourages both domestic private capital and foreign investment to establish factories in Côte d'Ivoire. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture have both set up agricultural product processing bureaus, responsible for continuously promoting the development of the agricultural product processing industry, providing technical guidance to enterprises, and supervising product quality.

Côte d'Ivoire's vigorous development of the agricultural product processing industry and promotion of domestic consumption have brought many benefits. Firstly, it has significantly reduced imports, saved foreign exchange, increased national income, expanded local accumulation, and created numerous job opportunities. Additionally, it has strongly promoted scientific research and opened the door to both domestic and foreign capital. It has been proven that this approach not only helps the country overcome economic difficulties but is also a strategy of great significance for long-term development.

### 科特迪瓦提倡用国货

    科特迪瓦提倡用国货
    本报记者　杨汝生
    记者最近观察到，不论是在阿比让，还是在亚穆苏克罗的超级市场里，或是在农村集市上，标着“科特迪瓦产”字样的食品和日用品渐渐增多。有时还可看见手执话筒的推销员不厌其烦地向顾客宣传那些当地出的新产品如何物美价廉，甚至送给顾客免费试用和品尝。以本国产品为主的展销会、贸易周几乎每年都要举办几次。“请消费国货”、“购买国货，出口国货”的标语口号更是屡见报端。由于本地生产的东西大量进入市场，质量得到不断改进。这表明科特迪瓦人的消费观念正在发生深刻的变化。
    科特迪瓦是有名的“可可王国”，其可可产量早就跃居世界首位，但科特迪瓦人过去吃的巧克力主要靠从欧洲进口。这种
  “舶来品”不仅价格昂贵，而且由于此地气候湿热，保存起来十分困难。而今，阿比让能生产巧克力糖果和食品的厂家就有20多个，它们的产品已经部分地占领了科特迪瓦的市场。巧克力糖、巧克力酱、巧克力粉、巧克力点心等，真是应有尽有。
    科特迪瓦过去每年要从外国进口50万吨奶制品，现在2／3的奶制品已由本国生产。近年还在阿比让建了制药厂，它生产的6种常用药已开始上市，这个厂除了有外国资本外，国内150家药店的老板也是它的股东。科特迪瓦还是西非地区航空食品的主要生产国，它每天为本国和外国的17家航空公司制造将近1万份冷、热食品。科生产的雀巢咖啡早已遐迩闻名，销往世界许多国家。科制定的新的投资法鼓励本国私人资本和外资在科办厂，科工业部和农业部都专门设立了农产品加工局，其职责是不断推进农产品加工业的发展，对企业进行技术指导，对产品质量实行监督。
    科特迪瓦大力发展农产品加工工业，提倡消费国货已经带来了许多好处。首先是大大减少了进口，节省了外汇，增加了国家的收入，扩大了地方上的积累并创造了大量的就业的机会。此外，它还有力地推动了科学研究，为本国和外国资本敞开了大门。事实证明，这样做不仅可以帮助国家渡过经济难关，而且也是具有重大意义的长期发展战略。
