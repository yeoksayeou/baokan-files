In the early 1960s, I worked as a journalist in Tanzania. For many years, I have always wanted to revisit East Africa, to travel along the Tanzam Railway, and to ride the train known as the "Iron Zebra" by Africans, racing through tropical forests and mountain gorges. Last July, I had the honor of visiting Tanzania and the opportunity to ride a section of the Tanzam Railway, fulfilling my long-held wish.

The train departed from the Dar es Salaam station, moving smoothly and swiftly forward. Along the way, it passed through dense coconut groves, primitive forests, red soil, and green mountains, with a magnificent and enchanting scenery. The stations, large and small, were all clean and bright, with passengers coming and going in an orderly manner. Freight transport was also busy, with warehouses filled with fertilizers, agricultural machinery to be sent to the interior, and copper materials from Zambia ready for export. When the train passed through residential areas, groups of children would run to see us, shouting in Swahili: "Wachina" (Chinese), "Rafiki" (friends).

This railway was started in October 1970 and completed in June 1975. During this period, there were usually about 16,000 Chinese workers and experts participating in the construction. If those who worked in shifts are included, then a total of 100,000 Chinese people participated in the construction. They, along with Tanzanian and Zambian workers, braved extremely harsh geographical and climatic conditions, cutting through mountains and valleys, building bridges and tunnels, and opening a path through the primitive forests and wilderness.

The leader of the Chinese expert team, Zhang Zhiying, worked here for more than eight years to build and manage this railway, dedicating the most precious years of his life to it. Now, he leads 150 Chinese experts, working with Tanzanian and Zambian friends to jointly manage the railway's operations.

Since 1983, when the Tanzanian and Zambian governments requested that China send experts to participate in the railway's management, the three parties established a management committee, and cooperation has been very harmonious. Chinese experts respect the sovereignty of Tanzania and Zambia and the opinions of the two general managers, while actively and responsibly proposing suggestions on management and personnel matters. The Tanzanian and Zambian general managers also respect the Chinese experts, often seeking their opinions before making decisions. The three parties have a normal office meeting system, preparing discussion outlines before meetings; decisions are made during meetings, and if a decision cannot be made immediately, it is discussed again at the next meeting. Through joint management, various tasks are carried out smoothly, and efficiency gradually improves. Everyone realizes that building this railway is a monumental task, but managing and operating it is even more challenging and important. Zhang Zhiying said: "Since we are involved in management, we must continuously accumulate and summarize experience. This is even more important under the situation of China's opening up to the outside world."

Under joint management, the railway's economic benefits have significantly improved over the past five years, and it has gradually become profitable. By just the first five months of 1988, it had earned a net profit of 12 billion Tanzanian shillings (equivalent to 480 million yuan), a situation that has been rare since the railway's completion. Tanzanian and Zambian friends happily pointed out: if there were enough locomotives, passenger and freight transport on the railway would double, and income would greatly increase.

Due to the profits, the railway authorities have begun to repay the loans from China for spare parts maintenance. Regarding the loans for the construction, Zhang Zhiying believes that the Tanzanian and Zambian sides are serious and responsible in repaying the loans and will repay them according to the agreement starting from 1991 over a period of 30 years.

From what I have seen of the Tanzanian and Zambian leaders, people from all walks of life, railway employees, and passengers, everyone unanimously affirms and praises the important role this railway plays in the economic development of Tanzania and Zambia and in the liberation cause of Southern Africa. They all call it the "Road to Independence," the "Road to Freedom." Whenever they mention it, they naturally praise and thank China. Tanzanian leader and Revolutionary Party Chairman Nyerere sincerely said to me: "Our two countries have such a good relationship, mainly thanks to the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people. China's great support is entirely out of selfless friendship. This is something that people should never forget."

　　“钢铁斑马”在“自由之路”上飞奔
　　高梁
    六十年代初，我作为记者曾在坦桑尼亚工作过。多少年来，我总想有一天能重访东非，沿着坦赞铁路，乘坐被非洲人称之为“钢铁斑马”的火车，在热带森林和高山峡谷间奔驰。去年七月，我有幸应邀访问了坦桑，并有机会乘坐一段坦赞铁路的火车，实现了我的宿愿。
    列车从达累斯萨拉姆车站出发，平稳而迅速地向前奔驰，沿途经过茂密的椰林、原始森林、红色土地和绿色山脉，景色十分壮观迷人。大小车站都很干净豁亮，乘客络绎不绝，上下车整齐有序。货运也很繁忙，库房里放着有待运到内地去的化肥、农业机械和准备出口的赞比亚的铜材。当列车经过居民点时，一群群孩子一边跑着来看我们，一边用斯瓦希里语喊着：“瓦秦纳”（中国人），“拉菲克”（朋友）。
    这条铁路是一九七零年十月破土动工的，一九七五年六月全部竣工。在这期间，参加筑路的中国工人和专家经常有一万六千人左右，如果把先后轮换的人计算在内，则共有十万中国人参加了筑路。他们在极其恶劣的地理和气候条件下，同坦、赞工人一起，劈山开岭，架桥凿洞，从原始森林和荒野中开出了一条路。
    跟我同行的中国专家组组长张志英同志为了建设和管理好这条铁路，在这里前后工作八年多，把一生中最宝贵的年华献给了这条铁路。现在，他正率领一百五十名中国专家，同坦、赞朋友们一起，共同管理着铁路的运营。
    自从一九八三年坦、赞政府要求中国派专家参与铁路管理以来，三方成立了管理委员会，合作得非常融洽。中国专家尊重坦、赞两国的主权和两国总经理的意见，同时积极负责地提出经营管理和人事方面的建议；坦、赞总经理也非常尊重中国专家，在做出决定前往往先征求中国专家的意见。三方有正常的办公会议制度，会前准备好讨论提纲；会上作出决定，一时决定不下的，下次再议。通过共同管理，各项工作开展顺利，效率逐渐提高。大家都认识到：建筑这条铁路是艰巨的，而经营管理好它更艰巨，更重要。张志英说：“我们既然参与管理，就要不断积累和总结经验。在我国对外开放的形势要求下，这一点就更为重要了。”
    在共同管理下，五年来铁路的经济效益显著提高，并且逐渐赢利。仅一九八八年一月至五月，已赢得纯利润十二亿坦桑先令（合人民币四千八百万元），这种情况是铁路建成以来少有的。坦赞朋友高兴地指出：如果有足够的机车，铁路的客运、货运都会增加一倍，收入也会大大增加。
    由于赢利，铁路当局已开始偿还我国关于零件维修的贷款。关于筑路用的贷款，张志英认为，坦、赞方面对偿还贷款的态度是认真负责的，它们将会按照协议从一九九一年开始分三十年偿还。
    从我接触到的坦、赞领导人、各界人士、铁路员工和旅客来看，大家都异口同声地肯定和称赞这条铁路对坦、赞两国的经济发展和对南部非洲的解放事业所起的重要作用，人们都把它称为“独立之路”、“自由之路”；每当提起它，他们都很自然地要赞扬和感激中国。坦桑尼亚领导人、革命党主席尼雷尔在接见我时发自内心地说：“我们两国关系这么好，主要感谢中国领导人和中国人民。中国的巨大支持完全出自无私的友谊。这是人们永远不应该遗忘的。”
