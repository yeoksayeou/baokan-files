During the enthusiastic celebration of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, the Chongqing Writers' Association held an awards ceremony for literary works created over the past 40 years. This is a very meaningful event.

We have deep feelings for Chongqing. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, we were transferred from Yan'an to work at the *Xinhua Daily* in Chongqing. We fought alongside the people of Chongqing, endured hardships together, struggled against reactionary forces, and together welcomed the victory of the War of Resistance. The scenes from that time are vivid in our memory and will never be forgotten. Therefore, we always pay special attention to literary and artistic works published in Chongqing or that depict the arduous struggles of the past and the diligent construction of the present. We are happy for your achievements in literature and art, and even more thrilled by the successes of the Chongqing people in socialist construction. Seeing the changes in Chongqing today, it feels like a different world. Only those who have personally experienced the hardships of old Chongqing can truly appreciate the hard-won nature of today's new Chongqing and new life, and thus love Chongqing even more, love the Party, and love the people of Chongqing.

I believe that the writers of Chongqing, or those who have worked in Chongqing and depicted the struggles and transformations of Chongqing and the people of the nation, have not let down the expectations of Chongqing and the people of the nation. You have created many excellent works, shaping numerous indomitable revolutionary heroes. They are the backbone of our nation, and their images and deeds will forever live in our hearts. You have also shaped many unsung but steadfast builders of the new society, as well as many reformers who are brave in innovation and rich in creative spirit, and so on. Only a great Party and a great people can nurture such outstanding figures. However, without the noble hearts and magical pens of writers to depict them, it would be impossible to leave so many brilliant images in literature. It is truly "not until it is arranged, does one realize its magnificence." Through your selection and awarding of these works, everyone can see more clearly. This also greatly boosts the confidence of literary and artistic workers.

For the literary creation of the past 40 years in this region, you are the first to conduct a comprehensive review and selection nationwide. I think this experience is worth promoting. This has a great advantage: it shows the continuity of literary creation. Through this award, we can summarize the path and experience of literary creation over the past 40 years, summarize our gains and losses, and use them as a reference for further development. This is very meaningful.

In recent years, there has been a tendency in the literary and artistic circles to deny history and cultural artistic heritage. They not only deny the achievements of literature and art after the founding of the nation for 17 years but also deny the literary creation after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, deny the revolutionary literature of the 1930s, and deny the progressive literature that began with the May Fourth Movement. This is a tendency of cultural nihilism. Any nation or individual that denies its own history will not have a bright future. Because without a deep cultural foundation, how can one leap to the heights from nothing? As far as I know, only two kinds of people do this: one is the "Left" like the early Soviet "RAPP" faction, who abandoned all national cultural heritage and dreamed of building "communist culture" on a barren land, which naturally became a laughing stock; the other is the "wholesale Westernization" theorists who have emerged in our country in recent years, who look down on their own national culture and art, thinking that everything foreign is good, and thus imitate, plagiarize, and mechanically transplant the dregs of foreign art, completely detached from the national artistic tradition, detached from the spirit of the times in today's China, detached from the preferences of the Chinese people, and even the language does not sound like that of the Chinese. They claim that their works are written for readers 500 years later. Such works have few readers left, and they have to lament the loss of "sensation." So, some people simply degenerate into writing vulgar erotic literature and go down the wrong path.

I visited the ancient city of Ciqikou, and the host asked me to write a few words. I wrote two sentences: "History cannot be severed, the fire still passes on even when the wood is exhausted." The second sentence is from Zhuangzi. I borrowed it to mean that although this ancient city has disappeared, the spirit of the people who fought to the death to defend their homeland at that time still exists today and can move millions of later generations. Many of our earlier literary works are also like this, and they will also live forever in the hearts of the people.

Since 1979, when Comrade Deng Xiaoping reaffirmed the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles, a trend opposing the Four Cardinal Principles and advocating bourgeois liberalization has emerged in the fields of ideology, theory, and literature and art. Later, it developed into an open trend. As everyone knows, the leaders in charge of the central work at that time not only did not stop this trend but also protected and indulged it, while suppressing and striking those who adhered to the Four Principles. As a result, those who advocated bourgeois liberalization became even more rampant and unrestrained, eventually joining forces with external elements to stage a farce aimed at overthrowing the People's Republic of China. For a time, domestic and foreign reactionary forces were extremely delighted. However, they were happy too soon. The Chinese people quickly and decisively suppressed the riot.

In this struggle to defend socialism and the People's Republic, our literature and art should play a significant positive role. Our literature and art are powerful weapons to defend socialism and oppose bourgeois liberalization. In the struggle between the two forces and the two ideologies, our literature and art can never be "neutral." "Neutrality" is actually a tolerance and surrender to evil forces.

Let us unite closely, under the leadership of the Party, always stand with the people, create more and better works, improve the cultural and moral quality of the people, inspire the spirit of hard struggle, and build a powerful socialist motherland, making greater contributions!

    继承优秀传统　才有美好将来
    林默涵
    在热烈庆祝建国四十周年的时候，重庆作家协会举办建国四十年来的文学创作评奖，这是很有意义的事情。
    我们对于重庆，是抱有深厚的感情的。我们在抗日战争时期从延安调到重庆《新华日报》工作，我们曾和重庆人民一起战斗过，一起经历过艰难困苦，一起同反动势力作过斗争，也一起迎接了抗日战争的胜利。当时的种种情景，历历在目，是永远不能忘记的。因此，我们也总是特别关心重庆出版的或描写重庆过去的艰苦斗争和今天的辛勤建设的文学艺术作品。我们为你们在文学艺术上的收获而高兴，更为重庆人民在社会主义建设中取得的成就而欢欣鼓舞。我们看到重庆今天的变化，真是恍如隔世。只有亲自看见、亲身体味过旧重庆的苦难生活的人，才会知道今天新的重庆和新的生活的来之不易，才会愈加热爱重庆，愈加热爱党、热爱重庆人民。
    我以为，重庆的作家们或在重庆工作过、表现过重庆和全国人民的斗争与变革的作家们，是没有辜负重庆和全国人民的期望的。你们创作了很多很好的作品，塑造了许多坚韧不拔的革命英雄人物，他们和她们是我们民族的脊梁，他们的形象和事迹，永远活在我们心中。你们也塑造了许多默默无闻、然而顶天立地的新社会的建设者，你们还塑造了不少勇于革新、富有创造精神的改革事业家，等等。只有伟大的党、伟大的人民，才能哺育出这些杰出的人物。但是，如果没有作家们的高尚心灵和生花妙笔来加以描绘，也不可能在文学上留下这么多的光辉形象。真是“不摆不清楚，一摆吃一惊”，经过你们把这些作品加以挑选、评奖，大家就看得更加清楚了。这也大大增加了文艺工作者的信心。
    对建国四十年来本地区的文学创作，来一次总检阅、总评选，在全国各地，你们这是第一次。我以为这个经验值得推广。这有一个很大的好处，就是表现了文学创作的连续性，可以通过这个评奖，来总结建国四十年来文学创作的道路和经验，总结我们的得失，作为进一步向前发展的借鉴，这是很有意义的。
    近几年来，文艺界有一种倾向，就是否定历史，否定文化艺术遗产。他们不但否定建国后17年的文艺成就，而且否定延安文艺座谈会以后的文艺创作，否定30年代的革命文艺，否定从“五四”开始的进步文艺。这是一种文化虚无主义的倾向。凡是否定自己历史的民族或个人也就不会有美好的将来。因为不从深厚的文化基础出发，又怎么能凭空跃上高峰呢？据我所知，只有两种人是这样干的：一种是来自“左”的方面的像苏联早期的“拉普”派那样的人，他们抛弃一切民族文化遗产，幻想在光秃的地面上建设“共产主义文化”，结果当然成为笑料；另一种就是近几年来我国出现的来自右的方面的“全盘西化”论者，他们看不起自己民族的文化艺术，以为一切都是外国的好，于是模仿、抄袭、生搬硬套外国的那些末流艺术，完全脱离本国的艺术传统，脱离今天中国的时代精神，脱离中国人民的爱好，甚至连语言都不像中国人的，他们自称他们的作品是为500年后的读者写的。这样的作品，已经没有多少人看了，他们不得不发出“失却轰动效应”的哀叹。于是，有些人就干脆堕落到去写下流的性文学，完全走上了末路。
    我去参观古钓鱼城，主人要我题字，我写了两句话：“历史割不断，薪尽火仍传。”第二句是庄子的话。我借用来，意思是这座古城虽然消失了，但当时人民决死守卫国土的精神，却至今不灭，还能感动千千万万的后人。我们的许多较早的文学作品，也是如此，它们也会长久地活在人民心中。
    自从1979年邓小平同志重申坚持四项基本原则以后，在思想、理论、文艺界就出现了一股反对四项基本原则、坚持搞资产阶级自由化的暗流，后来发展成明流。正如大家所知，当时主持中央工作的领导人不但不来制止这种倾向，反而加以保护、纵容，对于坚持四项原则的同志，则加以压制、打击。以至搞资产阶级自由化的人更加猖狂、更加肆无忌惮，终于内外结合，演出了一场企图颠覆中华人民共和国的大闹剧。一时国内外的反动势力，真是兴高采烈。可是，他们高兴得太早了。中国人民迅速果断地平息了暴乱。
    在这场保卫社会主义、保卫人民共和国的斗争中，我们的文学艺术应该发挥巨大的积极作用。我们的文艺，是保卫社会主义的有力武器，是反对资产阶级自由化的有力武器。在两种势力、两种思想的斗争中，我们的文艺是永远不可能“中立”的。“中立”实际上就是对于恶势力的纵容与投降。
    让我们紧密地团结起来，在党的领导下，永远同人民站在一起，创作出更多更好的作品，为提高人民的文化、道德素质，振奋人民的艰苦奋斗精神，建设强大的社会主义祖国，作出更大的贡献！
