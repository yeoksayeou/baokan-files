I have known Comrade Xu Xuehan for over 60 years, and his revolutionary career is quite extraordinary.

Comrade Xuehan joined the Chinese Communist Party at the age of 15. In 1926, he served as the head of the Organization Department of the Hangzhou Municipal Committee, and it was around this time that I also joined the Party. In early 1928, Comrade Xuehan was arrested in Ningbo and transferred to the Hangzhou Military Prison, where we studied Marxist works together. In the summer of 1933, Comrade Xuehan was released from prison after serving his sentence, and in the winter of the same year, Comrade Luo Gengmo was also released. Both of them were introduced by me to work at the China Economic Intelligence Agency. The funds for the China Economic Intelligence Agency were entirely supported by a few friends who contributed a portion of their meager earnings from their writings. To expand the propaganda front, in 1934, we also launched the monthly publication "China Rural," followed by the establishment of the New Knowledge Bookstore in 1935. During this period, Comrade Xuehan demonstrated his outstanding abilities in theoretical propaganda work.

From 1934 to the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Xuehan wrote articles on a wide range of topics, covering industry, agriculture, railways, customs, markets, currency, finance, and fiscal matters. The central themes of these articles were: first, exposing how imperialist economic aggression strangled China's national industries and exacerbated rural economic collapse; second, how British, American, and Japanese imperialists divided China's market and seized China's sovereignty over railways, customs, currency, finance, and fiscal matters; third, how warlordism and civil war caused market fragmentation and colluded with feudal forces to intensify the oppression and exploitation of the vast majority of peasants. This part of his works became increasingly insightful as his knowledge grew, especially the chapters "The Process of Colonization of Chinese Industry," "Will the British and Americans Jointly Manage Chinese Currency?", "After the Arrival of the American Economic Investigation Team in China," and "The Problem of Investment by the Great Powers in China," which have profound insights and are very valuable for understanding the economic situation at that time.

During this period, Comrade Xuehan actively participated in the anti-Japanese salvation movement and was an active member of the Communist Party within the National Salvation Association. He had close ties with Comrades Shen Junru and Zhou Tongfen and led the New Knowledge Bookstore, which became one of the activity venues for the National Salvation Association. In a short few years, under Comrade Xuehan's management, the New Knowledge Bookstore not only established a foothold but also rapidly developed its business, becoming an important force in the white areas for propagating Marxism and the Party's policies in the field of economics.

From the day it was established, the New Knowledge Bookstore operated under the strong leadership of the Party. Until the eve of the founding of New China, the New Knowledge Bookstore merged with the Life Bookstore and the Readers Publishing House in Hong Kong, founded by Comrades Zhou Tongfen and Li Gongpo, to form the Life, Readers, and New Knowledge Bookstore, providing a batch of outstanding cadres for the publishing industry of New China. As one of the main founders of the Life, Readers, and New Knowledge Bookstore, Comrade Xuehan made an indelible contribution to the development of China's modern publishing industry.

In 1943, Comrade Xuehan went to work in the base areas and served as the deputy director of the Huazhong Bank, playing an important role in various fields of practical economic work. In July 1945, he published the article "Currency in the Liberated Areas of Huazhong," summarizing the experience of issuing "anti-currency."

From spring 1946 to summer 1948, Comrade Xuehan was commissioned to establish a number of banks, money shops, and foreign trade institutions for the Party in Shanghai and Hong Kong, achieving good results and enriching his practical knowledge and experience in financial and trade work.

After the liberation of Shanghai, Comrade Xuehan participated in the takeover of domestic and foreign trade work. In 1952, Comrade Xuehan was transferred from Shanghai to Beijing to serve as the deputy minister of the Foreign Trade Department of the Central People's Government, mainly engaged in trade exchanges between China and Eastern European socialist countries.

A sudden calamity struck Comrade Xuehan in 1955 when the Pan (Pan Hannian) and Yang (Yang Fan) incident occurred. Comrade Xuehan, who had worked with Comrade Hannian, was implicated and sentenced to 12 years in prison and deprivation of political rights for 5 years by the Supreme Court. During the Cultural Revolution, Comrade Xuehan was sent to the "cow shed" for struggle sessions and was sent to the "May 7th Cadres School" for labor reform from 1969 onwards. Later, Comrade Hannian's case was overturned, and Comrade Xuehan was exonerated. In 1981, the Supreme People's Court overturned the original verdict, and Comrade Xuehan's Party membership was restored. At that time, I invited him to work at the Economic Research Center of the State Council as a permanent secretary, allowing him to display his talents once again.

In 1981, Comrade Xuehan published two articles on the population issue, carefully summarizing and comparing the research on population theory over the past 30 years, which was not mere empty talk but maintained his past writing style. In recent years, with the development of the situation, he has deeply considered and proposed outstanding views on commodity production, special economic zone construction, controlling fixed asset investment, and maintaining comprehensive balance. The article "A Choice in the Direction of Financial Use" published in 1983 proposed to reduce basic construction investment and allocate part of the financial resources to support wage and price reforms, which is an important insight. If adopted, our economic system reform would encounter fewer difficulties.

In recent years, Comrade Xuehan has also written some memoirs, with more than 10 included in this collection. Most of these articles are written to commemorate comrades who passed away earlier than us and faithfully record their revolutionary activities and lives in the 1930s and slightly later periods. Two of them are memoirs of the establishment of the New Knowledge Bookstore and participation in the takeover of domestic and foreign trade work after the liberation of Shanghai, containing a lot of first-hand historical materials that we can know.

Comrade Xuehan has suffered a lot and, after resuming work in 1978, has been working day and night. Since 1985, his health has declined, but in 1987, he was still able to write three articles on financial reform and population issues. Now that his collected works are about to be published, I am genuinely happy and hope that he will recover his health and make more and greater contributions to China's economic reform cause.

　　《徐雪寒文集》序
　　薛暮桥
    我和徐雪寒同志交往已60余年，他的革命生涯是颇不寻常的。
    雪寒同志15岁时就参加了中国共产党，1926年担任过杭州地委组织部长，我也是在这个时候参加党的。1928年初，雪寒同志在宁波被捕，移押杭州陆军监狱，和我同在狱中一起苦读马克思主义著作。雪寒同志在1933年夏刑满出狱，和这年冬天刑满出狱的骆耕漠同志，都经我介绍，先后到中国经济情报社工作。中国经济情报社的经费，完全依靠十几位朋友从他们十分微薄的稿酬收入中扣留一部分来维持。为扩大宣传阵地，1934年我们又创办了
  《中国农村》月刊，紧接着在1935年建立了新知书店。在这期间，雪寒同志显示出了他在宣传理论工作方面的出色才干。
    雪寒同志在1934年到抗日战争爆发前夕写的文章题材十分广泛，包括了从工业、农业、铁路、海关、市场到货币、金融、财政等各个方面。这些文章的中心思想是：一、揭露帝国主义的经济侵略如何扼杀中国的民族工业，加剧农村经济破产；二、英、美、日帝国主义如何瓜分中国的市场，攫夺中国铁路、海关、货币、金融、财政等的主权；三、军阀割据和内战如何造成市场的分割，并与封建势力相勾结，加剧对广大农民的压迫和剥削。这一部分著作随着作者学识的增长，愈到后来愈精采，特别是《殖民地化过程中的中国工业》、《英美共管中国货币吗？》、《美国经济考察团到华以后》和
  《列强对华投资问题》等篇章，确具真知灼见，对了解当时经济情况很有价值。
    雪寒同志在这时期积极参加抗日救亡运动，是救国会里共产党团的积极分子，与沈钧儒、邹韬奋等同志联系十分密切，他们领导的新知书店成为救国会活动场所之一。在短短几年时间里，新知书店在雪寒同志经营下，不仅站稳了脚跟，而且业务迅速发展，成了白区经济学界宣传马克思主义和党的政策的一支不可忽视的重要力量。
    新知书店从建立的一天起，就是在党的坚强领导下进行工作的。直到新中国诞生前夕，新知书店和邹韬奋、李公朴等同志创办的生活书店和读书出版社在香港合并，组成生活、读书、新知三联书店，为新中国的出版事业提供了一批优秀的干部。作为三联书店主要创始人之一的雪寒同志，他为中国现代出版事业建立了不可磨灭的功绩。
    1943年雪寒同志到根据地工作，曾任华中银行副行长，从此在实际经济工作的各条战线上发挥重要作用。1945年7月，他发表《华中解放区的货币》一文，总结了根据地发行“抗币”的经验。
    1946年春到1948年夏，雪寒同志奉命在上海、香港一带为党建立一批银行、钱庄、对外贸易机构等经济企业，取得了很好的成绩，同时，也更加丰富了他对金融贸易工作的实践和知识。
    上海解放后，雪寒同志随军接管对内对外贸易工作。1952年，雪寒同志从上海调到北京，担任中央人民政府对外贸易部副部长，主要从事我国和东欧社会主义国家之间的贸易往来。
    飞来横祸突然袭击雪寒同志，1955年发生潘
  （潘汉年）、杨（杨帆）事件。雪寒同志因与汉年同志有工作联系，遭到株连，被最高法院判处有期徒刑12年，剥夺公民权利5年。十年动乱期间，雪寒同志又被送进“牛棚”批斗，1969年后长期在“五·七”干校劳动改造。其后，汉年同志冤狱平反，雪寒同志也得以昭雪。1981年，最高人民法院撤消原判，雪寒同志随之恢复了党籍。这时，我请他到国务院经济研究中心担任常务干事，重新施展他的才华。
    1981年雪寒同志发表的两篇有关人口问题的论文，把30年来有关人口理论的研究作了极其认真细致的综合比较，决不是泛泛空论，仍然保持过去的写作作风。近几年来，随着形势的发展，对于商品生产、特区经济建设、控制固定资产投资和坚持综合平衡等问题，他都经过深思熟虑，提出卓越的见解。1983年发表的《财力使用方向的一项抉择》一文，提出压缩基本建设投资、腾出一部分财力来支持工资、物价的改革，这是一项重要的见解，如果得到采纳，我们的经济体制改革就会减少很多困难。
    雪寒同志近年来还写了一些回忆文章，收录在本文集的有10余篇。这些文章大部分是为了悼念比我们去世早的战友，而且忠实地记录了在30年代及稍后一些时期他们的革命活动和生活；两篇是回忆创建新知书店的战斗历程和上海解放后参加接管内外贸易工作的回忆，有不少是我们所能知道的第一手史料。
    雪寒同志因为饱经折磨，1978年恢复工作后又日夜操劳，1985年起健康情况减退，但1987年仍能写出金融改革和人口问题等3篇文章。现在他的文集即将出版，我由衷地感到高兴，同时希望他恢复健康，为我国的经济改革事业作出更多更大的贡献。
