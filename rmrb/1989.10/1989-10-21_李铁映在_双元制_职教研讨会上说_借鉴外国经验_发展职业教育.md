China–Federal Republic of Germany “Dual System” Vocational Education Seminar was held recently in Wuxi, Jiangsu. The meeting provided information indicating that China is learning from the Federal Republic of Germany’s “Dual System” vocational education experience, strengthening vocational education, and gradually making vocational education a key focus of overall educational development and reform. The goal is to explore and establish a new vocational education system that suits China's national conditions.

State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission Li Tieying delivered a written speech at the seminar. He emphasized the need to seriously focus on vocational education as a key project in the overall development and reform of education. He urged the study and learning of the Federal Republic of Germany’s experience in developing vocational education, and the summarization of China’s own experiences to find a path for developing vocational and technical education that suits China's national conditions.

The State Secretary of the Federal Republic of Germany's Ministry of Economics, Lang, also delivered a written address at the seminar.

The “Dual System” vocational and technical education is a successful model of vocational education in the Federal Republic of Germany. It involves close cooperation between enterprises and vocational schools, implementing a vocational education system that combines practice with theory. The core of this system is to prioritize enterprises in the cooperation between schools and enterprises, and to prioritize technical skills in theoretical and technical education. This approach conducts highly practical professional training to cultivate skilled technical workers and technicians with strong professional skills and a strong sense of professionalism. China and the Federal Republic of Germany have nearly 10 years of experience in exchanging and cooperating in the field of vocational education. Since the establishment of the Nanjing Construction Vocational Training Center in 1982, the two countries have cooperated on more than a dozen projects in Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places.

　　借鉴外国经验　发展职业教育
    据新华社南京10月20日电　（记者杨福田）中国—联邦德国“双元制”职业教育研讨会日前在江苏无锡召开。会议提供的情况表明，我国正借鉴联邦德国“双元制”职业教育经验，加强职业教育，逐步把职业教育作为整个教育发展和改革的一项重点，探索和建立一种符合我国国情的新的职业教育体系。
    国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映在研讨会上发表了书面讲话。他要求把职业教育作为整个教育发展和改革的一项重点工程认真抓好，认真研究和学习联邦德国发展职业教育的经验，并总结我国的经验，摸索一条符合我国国情的发展职业技术教育的路子。
    联邦德国经济合作部国务秘书朗格在研讨会上也发表了书面致词。
    “双元制”职业技术教育是联邦德国职业教育的成功模式，它是由企业和职业学校密切合作，实行实践与理论并举的职业教育制度。它的核心是在学校与企业合作中以企业为主，在理论与技能教育中以技能教育为主，进行实践性很强的专业培训，培养具有熟练的专业技能和强烈的职业意识的技术工人和技师。我国和联邦德国在职业教育领域的交流和合作已有近10年的历史。从1982年筹建南京建筑职业技术培训中心以来，双方已在南京、北京、上海、天津等地进行了十几个项目的合作。
