Premier Li Peng stated during a meeting with Prime Minister Tofilau that China and Britain had already reached an agreement on the Hong Kong issue. He emphasized that attempts to pressure China would be futile. Premier Li hosted a banquet to welcome the Samoan dignitaries.

	People's Daily, Beijing, October 26th - Reporter Gu Yuqing reports: This afternoon, Premier Li Peng, when discussing the Hong Kong issue, said that China and Britain had already reached an agreement on resolving the Hong Kong issue. However, some people now want to backtrack from the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue, playing three cards: the so-called "public opinion card," "confidence card," and "internationalization," attempting to pressure the Chinese government. This is futile. The Chinese government has always been principled and trustworthy, always faithfully fulfilling and adhering to agreements reached with other countries. The execution of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue will be no exception. The Chinese government, both now and in the future, will closely monitor the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.

	This was stated by Premier Li Peng during a meeting with the visiting Prime Minister of Western Samoa, Tofilau Eti Alesana, in the Great Hall of the People after a welcoming ceremony.

	Tofilau stated during the meeting that our two countries have a good relationship, with no issues between us. As fellow developing countries, we have similar situations and therefore need to frequently exchange experiences in construction and development.

	Premier Li Peng agreed with this and said that although China and Western Samoa are far apart, we are both in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese government hopes that this region can maintain peace and stability, allowing developing countries to better develop themselves. China will continue to strive for friendly cooperation with countries in this region.

	At the request of the guests, Premier Li Peng introduced the Cambodian issue and the stance of the Chinese government on it. He emphasized that the key to fully resolving the Cambodian issue is that Vietnam must, under strict and effective international supervision, truly withdraw all its troops from Cambodia and establish a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk during the transitional period. Only in this way can genuine national reconciliation be achieved, prevent civil war, and ensure peace in Cambodia.

	Prime Minister Tofilau said that Western Samoa's stance on the Cambodian issue is the same as China's. He believes that the Cambodian issue will ultimately be resolved fairly and reasonably.

	Prime Minister Tofilau also said that only the government and people of a country truly understand its internal affairs, and only they have the right to solve their own problems.

	Prime Minister Tofilau said that based on this, he is visiting China to renew the established friendship and further develop this friendship.

	Li Peng said that China's doors have always been open. Many state guests and people from various circles have visited, and we believe that in the near future, there will be even more visitors.

	The two sides also had an in-depth discussion on economic and various aspects of cooperation between the two countries.

	People's Daily, Beijing, October 26th - Reporter Gu Yuqing reports: This evening, Premier Li Peng hosted a banquet in the Western Hall of the Great Hall of the People to welcome Prime Minister Tofilau Eti Alesana of Western Samoa and his wife, as well as other Samoan dignitaries.

	Premier Li Peng, in his speech at the banquet, said that Western Samoa has a long cultural and historical heritage and was the first country in the South Pacific island nations to gain independence. In the 14 years since China and Western Samoa established diplomatic relations, through multiple visits by leaders of both countries, equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation, and increasing cultural and sports exchanges, the friendly cooperative relationship between the two countries has developed satisfactorily.

	Premier Li Peng continued, saying that in recent years, the countries of the South Pacific have increasingly focused on maintaining national independence, regional stability, strengthening regional cooperation, and developing the economy of the region. As a neighboring country of the South Pacific region, China firmly supports the reasonable demands of the South Pacific countries to establish a South Pacific nuclear-free zone, supports the South Pacific countries' struggle against foreign interference and for national self-determination, and appreciates the active proposals of the South Pacific countries to protect and reasonably develop fishery resources. We hope to further develop friendly relations with South Pacific countries that have diplomatic relations with China and are willing to establish and develop equal and mutually beneficial friendly cooperative relations with South Pacific countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We firmly oppose any attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and firmly oppose the Taiwan authorities' so-called "dual recognition" aimed at undermining national unity and creating "two Chinas."

	Prime Minister Tofilau, in his response, said that China, with its unpretentious attitude, has increased its presence and participation in the South Pacific region and is sincere to friends, offering assistance when needed. Western Samoa warmly welcomes China as our friend and partner.

	Regarding the interactions between countries, Premier Li Peng reiterated that China has always advocated that countries, regardless of size, wealth, or strength, should be treated equally, respect each other, and live in friendship. Internal affairs of each country should be resolved by its own people, and no country has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another country for any reason.

	Premier Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, and Secretary-General of the State Council, Luo Gan, attended the banquet as hosts.

　　李鹏总理同托菲劳总理会谈时指出
　　中英为解决香港问题早已达成协议
　　有人企图对中国施加压力是徒劳的
　　李总理设宴欢迎西萨摩亚贵宾
    本报北京10月26日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天下午，李鹏总理在谈到香港问题时说，中英两国为解决香港问题早已达成协议，但现在有人想从中英关于香港问题联合声明的立场向后退，打出三张牌：即所谓“民意牌”、“信心牌”、“国际化”，企图对中国政府施加压力，这是没有用的。中国政府从来是讲原则的，守信用的，从来忠实履行和恪守同别国达成的协议。对中英关于香港问题联合声明的执行也绝不例外。中国政府无论现在和将来，都密切关注着香港的稳定和繁荣。
    这是在举行欢迎仪式后，李鹏总理与应邀来访的西萨摩亚总理托菲劳·埃蒂·阿莱萨纳在人民大会堂进行会谈时，讲这番话的。
    托菲劳在会谈时说，我们两国关系很好，不存在任何问题。我们作为同是发展中国家，有相同的处境，因此，也需要经常交换建设和发展方面的经验。
    李鹏总理对此表示赞同，并表示，中国和西萨摩亚虽相隔遥远，但都同处亚太地区。中国政府希望该地区能保持和平与稳定，以便使发展中国家更好地发展自己。中国将一如既往致力于发展与该地区国家的友好合作关系。
    李鹏总理应客人的要求介绍了柬埔寨问题，以及中国政府对此所持的立场。他强调，全面解决柬埔寨问题，关键是越南必须在严格、有效的国际监督下，真正从柬埔寨全部撤军和在过渡时期建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。只有这样，才能实现真正的民族和解，防止发生内战，确保柬埔寨和平。
    托菲劳总理说，西萨摩亚在柬埔寨问题上和中国的立场是相同的。他认为，柬埔寨问题最终将会得到公正、合理的解决。
    托菲劳总理还说，对于一个国家的内部事务只有他们本国的政府和人民最了解，也只有他们最有权来解决自己的问题。
    托菲劳总理说，他正基于这一点，为了重温已经建立的友谊和进一步发展这种友谊来中国访问的。
    李鹏说，中国的大门从来是敞开的。现在已有许多国宾和各界人士来访，相信不久的将来，将会有更多的客人来访。
    宾主双方还就两国经济和各方面的合作关系进行了深入的探讨。
    本报北京10月26日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天晚上，李鹏总理在人民大会堂西大厅设宴欢迎西萨摩亚总理托菲劳·埃蒂·阿莱萨纳和夫人，以及其他西萨摩亚贵宾。
    李鹏总理在宴会上致词说，西萨摩亚具有悠久的文化和历史，也是在南太平洋岛国中最早赢得独立的国家。中国和西萨摩亚建交14年来，通过双方领导人多次互访，平等互利的经济合作，逐步增多的文化体育交流，使两国友好合作关系得到了令人满意的发展。
    李鹏总理接着说，近年来，南太平洋各国更加注重维护民族独立，保持地区稳定，加强区域合作，发展本地区的经济。中国作为南太平洋地区的邻国，坚决支持南太平洋各国关于建立南太平洋无核区的合理要求，支持南太各国反对外来干涉，实现民族自决的正义事业，赞赏南太各国为保护和合理开发渔业资源而提出的积极主张。我们希望同与中国有外交关系的南太平洋国家进一步发展友好关系，也愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上同尚未与中国建交的南太平洋国家建立和发展平等互利的友好合作关系。我们坚决反对任何制造“两个中国”、“一中一台”的图谋，坚决反对台湾当局推行的旨在破坏祖国统一和制造“两个中国”的所谓“双重承认”。
    托菲劳总理在答词中说，中国以不摆架子的态度增加了自己在南太地区的存在和参与，并且对朋友真诚，需要时能尽力相助。西萨摩亚非常欢迎中国作为我们的朋友和合作伙伴。
    对国与国之间的交往，李鹏总理重申，中国一贯主张，国家不分大小、贫富、强弱，都应一律平等，相互尊重，友好相处。各国的内部事务，应由各国人民自己解决，任何国家都无权以任何理由干涉别国内政。
