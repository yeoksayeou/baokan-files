People's Daily, Chengdu, October 17th - Reporter Lu Maocheng learned from the Sichuan Provincial Committee's meeting on work in Tibetan areas that the unity among various ethnic groups in Sichuan's Tibetan region has been further strengthened, and the economy is booming.

Sichuan's Tibetan region mainly refers to the Garze and Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures and the Muli Tibetan Autonomous County in Liangshan Prefecture, with a total population of 1.6 million, of which 1 million are Tibetans. This is second only to the Tibet Autonomous Region in terms of Tibetan population. The region covers 46% of Sichuan Province's area. Under the guidance of the Party's ethnic policies, ethnic cadres in the Tibetan region have been growing, with their proportion of the total number of cadres rising from 20% in 1980 to 42% today. Among them, 79% are at the prefecture-level leadership, and 70% are at the county-level leadership. The Tibetan region has implemented religious policies, opening 657 Tibetan Buddhist temples, basically meeting the needs of the masses for normal religious activities.

Political stability and unity have promoted the steady development of economic construction and various social undertakings. It is reported that the agricultural, industrial, and pastoral production in the Tibetan region have been developing steadily for 10 consecutive years. In 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the two prefectures and one county reached 1.217 billion yuan, an increase of 83.1% compared to 1978; the total grain output was 454,700 tons, an increase of 7.6%; the number of large livestock was 4.665 million, an increase of 31.9%; the per capita net income in rural areas was 526 yuan, an increase of fivefold. The basic livelihood problems of the majority of the people have been resolved. The Tibetan region's industry has developed from nothing to something, initially establishing more than 1,000 enterprises including machinery, metallurgy, electricity, mining, forestry, wool spinning, leather processing, papermaking, and dairy processing. Ethnic education, science and technology, culture, and health undertakings have also made significant progress. The development of the Tibetan region has attracted overseas Tibetans. The province has successively received more than 1,600 overseas Tibetan compatriots visiting their hometowns, with 180 people returning to settle in the country.
