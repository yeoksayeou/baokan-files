Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 15th.

The Vietnamese occupying forces in Cambodia announced at the end of September that they had "completely" withdrawn from Cambodia. However, in early October, they sent 450 soldiers and 100 tanks and armored vehicles back into Cambodia.

According to a broadcast by the Democratic Kampuchea Radio today, on October 7th and 8th, 100 tanks and armored vehicles, along with 200 trucks loaded with military supplies, entered Phnom Penh from the port of Kampong Som.

Prior to this, on October 4th, Vietnam transported 200 Vietnamese soldiers, disguised in Phnom Penh's fake military uniforms, to the province of Kampong Cham's Kambas Nay district. On October 5th, 250 disguised Vietnamese soldiers traveled in 8 vehicles along Route 3 to Phnom Penh. The next day, this convoy traveled along Route 6 to the northwestern province of Battambang's Pailin district.

This is the first time that the Democratic Kampuchea Radio has broadcast news of Vietnam increasing its troops in Cambodia since Vietnam announced the withdrawal of its "last batch of troops."

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, October 14th.

According to news from the border town of Aranyaprathet on the Thai-Cambodian border on the evening of the 14th, approximately 30,000 Cambodian refugees residing in the 8th refugee camp on the Thai-Cambodian border are moving to nearby hilly areas to avoid the artillery fire from the warring factions inside Cambodia.

    侵柬越军刚撤出又重返柬埔寨
    泰国边境柬难民营受到炮火威胁
    新华社北京10月15日电  侵柬越军当局9月底刚宣布“全部”从柬埔寨撤军，10月上旬就又向柬埔寨派遣450名士兵和100辆坦克、装甲车。
    据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，10月7日和8日，100辆坦克和装甲车，还有装满军用物资的200辆卡车从磅逊港开入金边市。
    在此之前，越南曾于10月4日把200名穿着金边伪军服装的越南士兵运到磅士卑省的贡比塞县。10月5日，经过伪装的250名越军乘坐8辆汽车沿3号公路开到金边。第二天，这个车队沿6号公路开到西北的马德望省诗梳风县。
    这是越南宣布撤出“最后一批军队”之后，民柬电台首次广播越南增兵柬埔寨。
    新华社曼谷10月14日电  据14日晚来自泰、柬边境城镇亚兰的消息说，大约3万多名居住在泰、柬边境8号难民营的柬埔寨难民为了躲避柬境内交战双方的炮火正在向附近丘陵地带转移。
