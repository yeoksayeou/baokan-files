    Persist in Implementing Open-Door Policy

    In December 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to shift the focus of work to the modernization of socialist construction, making the decision to revitalize the economy domestically and open up to the outside world. In 1982, China included the policy of opening up to the outside world as a long-term fundamental national policy in the Constitution.

    To promote opening up to the outside world and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign partners, China has not only successively formulated and promulgated more than a hundred laws and regulations, including the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures," but has also resolved issues arising from cooperation through government agreements and treaties. China has signed investment protection agreements with approximately 20 countries and has signed agreements with some countries to avoid double taxation and prevent tax evasion. In addition, China has taken a series of preferential measures for foreign partners.

    The forms and content of Sino-foreign economic cooperation have become increasingly diverse, including expanding import and export trade; introducing advanced foreign science and technology, learning advanced foreign management experience, and exchanging talents; absorbing and utilizing foreign capital, accepting foreign direct investment, and establishing joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, cooperating in production, development, research, and design; carrying out various forms of mutually beneficial cooperation with third-world countries, such as joint ventures, cooperative ventures, contract engineering, labor cooperation, and compensatory trade; and actively participating in international multilateral cooperation. Furthermore, direct investment overseas is being piloted.

    Although China's opening up to the outside world has not been long, it has already achieved remarkable results. So far, China's coastal areas have formed a multi-level open pattern including five special economic zones, 12 economic and technological development zones, 14 coastal open cities, and 283 open counties. As of early August 1989, the country had approved a total of 19,445 Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative ventures, wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and offshore oil cooperation development projects, of which more than 7,000 have been built and put into operation; absorbed more than $30 billion in foreign capital; introduced more than 20,000 advanced technologies and equipment, and renovated a number of key enterprises. More and more facts show that opening up to the outside world has promoted the development of China's industrial and agricultural production, strengthened the construction of key projects and weak links in the national economy, promoted the improvement of technological and management levels, supplemented and enriched the supply of the domestic market, increased national fiscal revenue, expanded the labor force, and added new vitality to China's national economy.

    Over the past decade, China's opening up to the outside world has achieved significant development in both breadth and depth in friendly cooperation with countries around the world. China's economic and technological cooperation with Western capitalist countries has further expanded to cover areas such as nuclear energy, electronics, telecommunications, aircraft, automobiles, coal mining, and hydroelectric power stations; economic and technological cooperation with third-world countries, whether in content or form, has become increasingly rich and diverse; political and economic relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have become increasingly close.

    After the Chinese government suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing in early June 1989, it reiterated that opening up to the outside world is a good policy for strengthening the country and enriching the people, and that it will be adhered to in the long term.

    On September 26, General Secretary Jiang Zemin discussed the state of the nation at a press conference with Chinese and foreign journalists.

    坚持实行对外开放
    1978年12月，中共十一届三中全会决定把工作重点转移到社会主义现代化建设上来，作出了对内搞活经济、对外实行开放的决策。1982年，中国把对外开放作为一项长期的基本国策载入了宪法。
    为促进对外开放和保护外国合作者的合法权益，中国不仅陆续制定、颁布了《中外合资经营企业法》等百余项法律和法规，而且还通过政府协定、协议妥善解决合作中出现的问题。中国同大约20个国家签订了保护投资协定，还同一些国家签订了对所得税避免双重征税和防止偷漏税的协定。此外，中国还采取了一系列对外国合作者的优惠措施。
    中外经济合作的方式和内容也日益广泛，包括扩大进出口贸易；引进外国先进科学技术，学习国外先进的管理经验，进行人才交流；吸收和利用外国资金，接受外国直接投资和建立中外合作企业、合资企业或外商独资企业，在生产、开发、研究和设计方面进行合作；开展同第三世界国家之间的合资经营、合作经营、承包工程、劳务合作及补偿贸易等多种形式的互利合作；积极参与国际间多边合作。此外，正在试行向海外直接投资等。
    中国对外开放虽然时间不长，但已取得显著成效。迄今，中国沿海已经形成包括5个经济特区、12个经济技术开发区、14个沿海开放城市和283个开放县的多层次的开放格局。据1989年8月初统计，全国已批准举办的中外合资、合作经营、外商独资经营企业及海洋石油合作开发项目共19445家，其中有7000多家已建成投产和运营；吸收外国资金300多亿美元；引进了两万多项先进技术和设备，改造了一批骨干企业。越来越多的事实表明，对外开放促进了中国工农业生产的发展，加强了国民经济重点项目和薄弱环节的建设，推动了技术水平和管理水平的提高，补充和丰富了国内市场的供应，增加了国家财政收入，扩大了劳动就业队伍，给中国的国民经济增添了新的活力。
    10年来的对外开放，使中国同世界各国的友好合作关系在广度和深度上获得重大发展。中国同西方资本主义国家的经济技术合作范围进一步扩大，发展到核能、电子、电讯、飞机、汽车、采煤、水电站等各个方面；同第三世界国家的经济技术合作，不论其内容还是形式，越来越丰富多样；同苏联和东欧等社会主义国家的政治与经济关系越来越密切。
    中国政府在1989年6月初平息北京的反革命暴乱之后重申，对外开放是一项强国富民的好政策，今后将长期坚持下去。（附图片）
