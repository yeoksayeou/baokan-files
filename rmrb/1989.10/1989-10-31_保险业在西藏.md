The insurance industry is rising in Tibet. Like other new developments on the roof of the world, it has attracted attention both domestically and internationally. More than 40 newspapers and magazines from Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and Hong Kong and Macau have reported on this matter.

Reflecting on the process of establishing the insurance industry in Tibet, I am deeply moved and have many thoughts.

The insurance industry in Tibet started late, and as of 1986, insurance business was virtually non-existent. During the planning stages of establishing the Tibet Insurance Company, relevant departments had made the following prediction about the future of insurance in Lhasa: the annual insurance premiums would amount to 150,000 yuan, while the company, with 25 employees, would require 200,000 yuan in operational costs, resulting in an annual loss of approximately 50,000 yuan. This conclusion was tantamount to canceling the birth certificate of the insurance industry in Tibet.

I was dispatched by the organization at the end of 1986 to oversee the establishment of the Tibet Insurance Company. We conducted a survey of the insurance environment in Tibet and discovered that, like the rest of the country, it had favorable conditions for the development of insurance. This is due to the implementation of reform and opening up over many years, which not only led to significant economic development but also changed people's minds. They aspire to modernization, are willing to accept new things, and hope that society will provide a good environment for economic development. Today, more than 400 state-owned and collective enterprises in Tibet are exhibiting unprecedented vitality, but there are also risks in their operations; yet, none of these enterprises have invested in property insurance. The numerous individual and private economies in urban and rural areas also need insurance for production, operations, and personal safety as they thrive. In 1986, the entire region reported 464 traffic accidents, resulting in 419 deaths and injuries and direct economic losses of 118,000 yuan, yet not a single person or vehicle received compensation from an insurance company. In the vast agricultural and pastoral areas, economic development is booming, but natural disasters severely hinder the path to prosperity for farmers and herders. Tibet's tourism prospects are excellent, with 30,000 foreign tourists visiting in 1987 alone. However, group travel insurance, like imported and exported goods, still needs to be underwritten by foreign companies. The Lhasa Hotel, a joint venture between Tibet, Hong Kong, and the United States, had delayed the project because there was no insurance company...

Insurance is indispensable for Tibet; economic construction and reform and opening up are urgently awaiting its support.

However, Tibetan society is different from the rest of the country, and the concept of insurance is difficult for people to accept here. Among the 2 million residents of the region, 98% are Buddhist. To this day, pilgrims still gather in front of the Potala Palace, and the crowds prostrating in and around the Jokhang Temple are endless day and night. From cities to rural and pastoral areas, from vast grasslands to deep forests, the sound of ancient temple bells can be heard everywhere. People sincerely pray to the gods for protection. On this land shrouded in religious beliefs, it is not easy for the insurance industry to take root and blossom. We adapt to local customs and, based on Tibet's actual situation, promote and popularize insurance.

In March 1987, we secured the strong support of the then-largest living Buddha, the Panchen Lama. He received me and had the entire assets of his newly established Gangjin Company insured with our company first. A Tibetan transportation specialist from Chamdo saw the news of the living Buddha participating in insurance and immediately traveled from thousands of miles away to Lhasa to insure his car and personal safety. In the past, when we promoted insurance in Lhasa, people were skeptical and even thought we were collecting taxes. After the Panchen Lama received us, within a month, more than 40 enterprises in Lhasa all insured with us.

Northern Tibet is a primitive Bon teaching area with more than 100,000 believers. It is impossible to approach the masses without the nod of the great living Buddha Yongjin Jiawa. We took the opportunity of the horse racing event in the Naqu region to specially visit Yongjin Jiawa. The great living Buddha, seeing our sincerity and familiarity with local customs, was very enthusiastic. He let us sit on a throne of equal height and shared yak meat and butter tea with us. We took this opportunity to explain to him the significant role of insurance in developing animal husbandry and prospering the pastoral economy. The great living Buddha tightly held my hand and said, "Developing the insurance industry on the northern Tibetan grasslands is a meritorious deed, and I fully support it." This opened up the situation for us in Northern Tibet.

Now, the family properties of several influential living Buddhas in Tibet have been insured with our company. One living Buddha humorously said, "In Tibet, farmers and herders regard me as a protective deity. You, the general manager, have insured me, so you are an even greater 'living Buddha.'"

To adapt to Tibet's economic and social conditions, we, with the support of the headquarters, promoted a set of more favorable measures and policies than those in the interior, such as lowering premium rates and increasing compensation amounts, thereby enhancing the attractiveness of insurance. In terms of service, we strictly adhere to the principle of "sincere service and honest integrity" to gain the trust of the people. The Transportation Bureau's Golmud Transportation Company had a car accident, and the company proactively paid 7,000 yuan in compensation. The policyholder was very grateful and told everyone about the thoughtful service of the insurance company, also promoting the benefits of insurance.

The practice of the Tibet Insurance Company over the past two years has proven that our initial optimistic predictions about this industry were correct. In 1987, the company operated for only half a year and earned 3.02 million yuan in insurance premiums. In 1988, the premium income increased by 50% compared to 1987, reaching 4.5 million yuan. This year's premium income is expected to increase by 50% compared to last year.

### 保险业在西藏

　　保险业在西藏
　　王以才
    保险业正在西藏崛起。它像出现在世界屋脊上的其他新事物一样，吸引着国内外的注意。欧美、东南亚、港澳地区的40多家报刊报道了这件事。
    回忆起在西藏创办保险业的历程，我内心颇不平静，感触良多。
    西藏保险业起步晚，直至1986年保险业务还是零。在酝酿成立西藏保险公司过程中，有关部门曾就拉萨市的保险前途作过这样的预测：每年可收得保险费15万元，而保险公司以25人开支计算需要费用20万元，收支相抵，每年将亏损5万元左右。这个结论无异取消了西藏保险业的出身证。
    我是1986年底由组织派去负责筹建西藏保险公司的。我们对西藏的保险环境作过调查，发现这里与内地一样具有发展保险的有利条件。这就是改革开放实施多年，不仅经济有了较大的发展，而且人的思想也在变。他们向往现代化，乐于接受新事物，希望社会为他们提供发展经济的良好环境。今天，西藏400多个国营、集体企业焕发出从未有过的活力，但经营中也有风险；而这么多企业还没有哪一家投了财产保险。城乡众多的个体经济、私营经济在蓬勃发展中也需要为之提供生产经营和人身方面的保险。1986年全区共发生交通事故464起，死伤419人，直接经济损失118万元，竟没有一人、一车得到保险公司的赔偿。在广大农牧区，经济发展蒸蒸日上，但自然灾害的袭击严重地阻碍着农牧民走向富裕道路。西藏旅游前景很好，仅1987年西藏就接待了3万名入境旅游者。但是，这里的旅游团体保险，与进出口商品一样还须由国外企业承保。西藏与香港、美国合资的拉萨饭店，曾经因为没有保险公司而外商迟迟不愿承接这项工程……保险，西藏不能没有它，这儿的经济建设、改革开放在急切地等待着它配套。
    然而，西藏社会与内地不同，“保险意识”在这里太难被人接受了。全区200万居民中，98％信仰佛教。时至今日，布达拉宫殿前仍然香客云集，大昭寺内外磕长头的人群昼夜不绝。从城市到农牧区，从莽莽草原到林深的山区，到处可听到嗡嗡的古刹钟声。人们虔诚地祈求神灵保佑一切。在这样的一块被宗教意识笼罩着的土地上，保险业要生根、开花，确非一件容易事。我们随乡入俗，从西藏的实际出发，宣传保险，推广保险。
    1987年3月，我们争取到了当时西藏最大活佛班禅大师的大力支持。他接见了我，并把他创办的刚坚公司的全部资产率先向我们公司投了保。昌都一个藏族运输专业户，从报上看到大活佛参加保险后，当即从千里之外赶到拉萨，办理了他的汽车和人身保险。过去，我们在拉萨市内动员投保，人们将信将疑，甚至以为我们是收税的。班禅大师接见我们以后，不到一个月时间，拉萨40多家企业全都投了保。
    藏北是原始的笨教教区，有10多万教徒，在那里开展工作，不得到大活佛永仲嘉瓦的点头是无法接近群众的。我们便借那曲地区赛马的机会，专门拜访了永仲嘉瓦。大活佛见我们诚心诚意，且熟知当地的风俗习惯，便十分热情，让我们坐在与他一般高的宝座上，同吃牦牛肉，喝酥油茶。我们乘此机会向他宣传保险对发展畜牧生产、繁荣牧区经济的重大意义。大活佛紧紧握住我的手说：“在藏北草原上开展保险事业，是一项功德无量的工作，我全力支持。”这一下，我们在藏北打开了局面。
    现在西藏几位有影响的大活佛家庭财产已在我们公司办了保险。有位活佛风趣地说：
  “在西藏，农牧民把我当成保护神，你这个总经理为我保了险，可见你是更大的‘活佛’。”
    为了适应西藏经济、社会的现状，我们在总公司支持下，推广了一套诸如降低保费率、增加赔付额等较内地更优惠的办法和措施，提高了保险的吸引力。在服务方面，我们严格遵守“忠诚服务，笃守信用”的原则，取信于民。交通厅格尔木运输公司一辆汽车肇事，公司主动派人支付了7000元赔款，保户非常感激，逢人就说保险公司服务周到，还为我们宣传保险的好处。
    西藏保险公司成立两年多来的实践，证明我们起初对这项事业所作的乐观预测是对的。1987年公司开展业务只有半年多时间，就收入保险费302万元，1988年保费收入比1987年增长50％，达到450万元。今年的保费收入预计仍比去年增长50％。
