Today is the Double Ninth Festival. The National "Old Age Contribution Elite Award" and "Filigree of Filial Piety Gold List Award" Conferment Ceremony and the Second National Conference on Aging were held this morning in the Great Hall of the People. The conference honored 1,902 advanced individuals from various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, central and state organs, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Armed Police who received the "Old Age Contribution Elite Award" and the "Filigree of Filial Piety Gold List Award." More than 3,000 people from various sectors of the capital attended the opening ceremony and celebrated the Double Ninth Festival with the central leaders.

Deng Yingchao and Nie Rongzhen each sent congratulatory messages to the conference. Song Ping, Song Renqiong, and others attended the meeting and presented certificates and medals to the award winners.

Before the meeting, Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi met with the attendees and took a group photo with them. Afterwards, Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech. He first extended sincere greetings to all the elderly comrades and colleagues across the country and to those working in the field of aging, and expressed warm regards to the award winners.

Jiang Zemin said, "Respecting and caring for the elderly is a fine tradition of the Chinese nation. Many of our elderly comrades have gone through the baptism of war, and many who worked in the white areas have also undergone life-and-death tests. The older generation has rich experience. I sincerely hope that the elderly comrades will enjoy a happy later life and, within their capabilities, continue to shine and make contributions. The fine revolutionary traditions of our Party must be passed on to the younger generation and carried forward. For young people, respecting the elderly is very important. Now, some young people, when the elderly recall their hardships and sweet memories, often say, 'What era is this!' To this, I want to say, no matter what era, even in the 21st century, the glorious revolutionary traditions must continue to shine!"

Wang Zhaohua, Chairman of the National Committee on Aging, presided over today's conferment ceremony. Song Renqiong and Song Ping spoke at the meeting.

Song Ping, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, extended warm congratulations to the conference and expressed high respect to all the elderly who contribute to society and to the filial children across the country. He said, "The elderly are a valuable asset to the Party and the state and are an important force for stability, unity, and the construction of the four modernizations. We must create conditions for them to participate in social development. At the same time, we must strengthen the education of young people, so that they become successors to socialism with communist ideals and a firm and correct political direction."

When talking about the current situation of population aging in China, Song Ping said, "At present, there are more than 91 million people aged 60 and above in China, and it is estimated that by the end of this century, there will be 130 million! Such a rapid development will inevitably bring about a huge change in the population structure, which will have a profound impact on China's politics, economy, and culture. This is a strategic issue related to the development of Chinese society. He urged all levels of leadership to fully recognize the importance and urgency of this issue. All levels of the Party Committee and the government should care for and support the work of aging and the development of the aging industry."

Attending today's conference were also: Wang Ping, Wang Shudao, Peng Chong, Wang Renzhong, Kang Keqing, Guo Linxiang, Liu Ningyi, Rong Gaotang, Mu Qing, Cui Naifu, He Jingzhi, and others.

    全国老有所为精英奖敬老好儿女金榜奖表彰大会在京召开
    江泽民乔石等领导同志会见到会代表
　　宋平代表党中央和国务院向大会祝贺
    本报北京10月8日讯　记者徐运平报道：今天是重阳节，全国“老有所为精英奖”、“敬老好儿女金榜奖”表彰大会暨第二次全国老龄工作会议上午在人民大会堂隆重召开。大会表彰了来自各省、自治区、直辖市、中央和国家机关、人民解放军和武警部队获得“老有所为精英奖”、“敬老好儿女金榜奖”的1902名先进人物。首都各界3000余人出席开幕式并与中央领导人共度重阳节。
    邓颖超、聂荣臻分别给大会发来了贺信。宋平、宋任穷等出席了会议并向“两奖”获得者颁发了证书和奖章。
    会前，江泽民、乔石会见了与会代表并与大家一起合影留念。之后，江泽民作了重要讲话。他首先向全国所有老前辈、老同志和做老龄工作的同志致以真挚的慰问！向“两奖”获得者表示亲切的慰问！
    江泽民说，尊老敬老是中华民族的优良传统。我们的老同志很多是经过战斗洗礼的，很多在白区工作过的同志也是经过生死考验的，老一辈有着丰富的经验。我衷心地希望老同志晚年愉快，同时在力所能及的范围内发光、做贡献。我党的优良革命传统要向年轻人传授，发扬光大。对年轻人来讲，尊老是非常重要的。现在有些年轻人当老年人对他们忆苦思甜时往往说：“现在都什么年代了！”对此，我要说，不管什么年代，就是到了21世纪，革命的光荣传统也要永放光芒！
    全国老龄委员会主任王照华主持今天的表彰大会，宋任穷、宋平先后在会上讲话。
    宋平代表党中央、国务院向大会表示热烈祝贺，并向全国老有所为的精英和敬老好儿女致以崇高的敬意。他说，老年人是党和国家的宝贵财富，是安定团结、建设四化的重要力量。我们要为他们参与社会发展创造条件。同时，要加强对青少年的教育，使他们成为有共产主义理想和坚定正确的政治方向的社会主义接班人。
    在谈到我国人口老龄化的现状时，宋平说，目前我国60岁以上的老年人已达9100多万，预测到本世纪末将达1.3亿！这么快的发展速度势必引起人口结构的巨大变化，给我国的政治、经济、文化带来深刻影响，这是一个关系到我国社会发展的战略问题。他要求各级领导干部要充分认识这个问题的重要性和紧迫性。各级党委和政府都要关心、支持老龄工作，发展老龄事业。
    出席今天大会的还有：王平、王首道、彭冲、王任重、康克清、郭林祥、刘宁一、荣高棠、穆青、崔乃夫、贺敬之等。
