The Lithuanian government of the Soviet Union decided on the 20th to take measures to restrict tourists from socialist countries from entering the country.

These measures include: residents of CMEA member countries can only visit Lithuania once a year upon invitation and must go through entry procedures; starting from the 23rd, the number of buses departing from Lithuania to Poland will be reduced from two to one; starting from the 1st of November, tourism without foreign exchange will be canceled.

The Lithuanian government explained the reasons for taking the above measures, stating that a large number of tourists from CMEA countries entering Lithuania have affected the supply of food and industrial goods for local residents, making the already abnormal economic and political situation even more complex.

　　苏立陶宛限制旅游者入境
    苏联立陶宛共和国政府二十日决定，对社会主义国家的旅游者采取措施限制其进入境内。
    这些措施包括：经互会成员国的居民每年只能应邀去立陶宛一次，并须办理入境手续；从十月二十三日起从立陶宛驶往波兰的客车由两次改为一次；从十一月一日起取消不付外汇的旅游。
    立陶宛政府在解释采取上述措施的原因时说，来自经互会国家的旅游者大量涌入立陶宛影响了本地居民的食品和工业品的供应，使本已不正常的经济和政治形势更加复杂。
