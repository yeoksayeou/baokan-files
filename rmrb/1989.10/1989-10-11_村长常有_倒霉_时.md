Recently, a village chief confided in me, "The season is approaching White Dew, and the wheat is about 80-90% ripe. Who would have thought that when I led my children and wife, carrying sickles, to our own fields, the 8 mu of wheat had already been stolen by someone. My wife saw this and burst into tears, sobbing, 'Being a village chief is like having eight generations of bad luck. We haven't made much money, but we've offended a lot of people.' Two days later, our mare lay still in the stall. We called a veterinarian from a neighboring village, who examined her for half a day but couldn't find anything wrong. At noon, the horse died. When I had someone open the mare's belly, we found a half-meter-long stick in her vagina."

Why does the village chief have "bad luck"? I visited over 20 households in the village who are well-informed about the situation and heard some straightforward opinions.

Villager A: Neighborhood disputes, grain collection, fights, and petty thefts all require the village chief to intervene, inevitably offending some people.

Villager B: When young people gamble or fight, the village chief steps in to manage, and they find ways to retaliate against the village chief.

Villager C: We haven't had a meeting in several years here. Now, even if we have meetings, we can't gather enough people. Higher authorities demand clean governance, but when policies reach the grassroots, no one supervises their implementation. Officials continue to take bribes without consequence. I heard that the village accountant hasn't settled accounts for several years. The masses want to report this but fear retaliation, so they can only take private revenge.

Villager D: We haven't seen any new party members or league members recruited in years, nor have we seen any party or league activities. Everyone is just chasing money, and their ideals have regressed. It's not just about stealing the village chief's wheat; they would dare to rob the county magistrate's wallet.

The village chief's "bad luck" is related to the villagers' state of mind. This indicates that relevant departments must strengthen ideological and political work in rural areas.

    村长常有“倒霉”时
    最近，一位村长向我诉说：“时令已近白露，小麦已黄八九成。谁知，当我领着孩子、老婆拿着镰刀走到自家地头时，8亩小麦已不知被谁割走。老婆见状，泪一把鼻涕一把地哭开了，‘当村长算倒了八辈子霉，钱没多挣，得罪下一大堆人’。过了两天，我家里的那匹母马卧槽不动，请来邻村的兽医检查了半天，也查不出害了啥病。中午，马死了，我请人打开马肚子，竟从母马阴道里发现一根半米长的木棍。”当村长为啥“倒霉”？我走访了这个村20多户知根晓底的人家，听到一些爽快之言。
    村民甲：邻里纠纷、催粮收款、打架斗殴、偷鸡摸狗都要村长出面管，难免得罪一些人。
    村民乙：年轻人赌博、打架的事，村长出面管管，他们就想方设法整治村长。
    村民丙：俺们这儿好几年没开过会，现在就是开会也召集不起人来。上面要求搞廉政建设，可政策一到下面，没人监督执行，当官的照吃不误。听说，村里会计好几年都不结账。群众想举报又怕遭打击，只好私下报复。
    村民丁：俺们这儿几年都没见发展过新党员、新团员，也不见党团组织有过什么活动。人们都在抓钱，思想也退步了。别说偷村长的小麦，就是掏县长的腰包也敢。
    村长的“倒霉”与村民的思想状况是相关联的。这说明有关部门一定要抓好乡村的思想政治工作。
