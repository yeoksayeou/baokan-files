Perhaps I am not as noble as the waters of Tianchi
Perhaps I am not as beautiful as the clear waters of West Lake
But I am the daughter of the Yangtze
With the steadfast character of the high mountains
With the passionate energy of cascading waterfalls
Born as a droplet in the snowy valley
Pure as a lily of the valley
Treading the rugged path
Enduring like a camel
Yet I have overcome the boulders
And the ravines
In front of the bamboo groves of the farmhouse
I play a lyrical prelude
Accompanied by pastoral songs
Flowing eastward, gently
In my melody
No one can find a note of sorrow
Even when the clouds obscure the moon
I have sighed at the darkness of the night
But from my playing
No one can hear the confused rhythm
Even under the scorching sun
I have felt restless
The journey is long
But my proud heart
Does not allow me to show it
I am the daughter of the Yangtze
With the depth and boldness of the Yangtze
Perhaps I am not as tranquil as a stream
Perhaps I am not as fortunate as a lake
But I am the daughter of the Yangtze
With the goddess's loving gaze
With the ocean's faithful wait
Silently moving through the gorges and rapids
Hurrying along the winding river
The water shimmers, reflecting the white pagoda
Temples and pavilions
The waves fade, submerging the castles
Mausoleums and sailboats
Under the sunlight, I sparkle and cheer
Reflected in my eyes are the city lights
The hot gaze of the city
A droplet of water
Is not the same as a piece of stone
I am the daughter of the Yangtze
With the perseverance and gentleness of the Yangtze

专栏：

　　长江的女儿
　　阿真
　　也许我不如天池水高贵
　　也许我不如西湖露晶美
　　可我是长江的女儿
　　自有高山坚毅的性格
　　自有飞瀑奔泻的激情
　　雪谷里出生的水珠
　　幽兰一般清纯
　　坎坷的路途上行走
　　骆驼一般艰辛
　　然而毕竟闯过乱石
　　沟壑
　　在农舍的竹林前
　　弹起抒情序曲
　　和着牧歌
　　悠悠东流
　　在我的乐章里
　　谁也找不到忧伤的
　　音符
　　尽管浮云蔽月时
　　我曾感叹夜的黑暗
　　从我的弹奏里
　　谁也听不见惶惑的韵律
　　尽管烈日当空
　　我曾焦躁
　　路的遥迢
　　可骄傲的心
　　不许我流露
　　我是长江的女儿
　　自有长江的深沉
　　和长江的豪放
　　也许我不如溪流恬适
　　也许我不如湖波幸运
　　可我是长江的女儿
　　自有神女含情的注目
　　自有大海忠诚的等候
　　峡谷险滩中默默前行
　　曲折河道上匆匆奔波
　　水光粼粼闪过白塔
　　寺庙楼阁
　　波影渺渺淹没城堡
　　皇陵帆舸
　　阳光下我闪烁我欢呼
　　辉映我的是灯火
　　城市炽热的瞳孔
　　一滴水珠
　　绝不同于一块石头
　　我是长江的女儿
　　自有长江的执著
　　和长江的温柔
