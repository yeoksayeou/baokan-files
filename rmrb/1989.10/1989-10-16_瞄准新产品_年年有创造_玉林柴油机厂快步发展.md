Yulin Diesel Engine Factory Rapidly Develops

	The Yulin Diesel Engine Factory in Guangxi has achieved remarkable growth from 1984 to 1988, with a five-year leap in production and tax revenue. The factory's output value and tax revenue have increased annually by 46% and 71% respectively. From January to August this year, the factory's output value reached 51 million yuan, and tax revenue amounted to 21.9 million yuan, which are 2.3 times and 15.7 times higher than the same period last year. The factory's per capita tax revenue and labor productivity have both exceeded the annual standards for national first-class enterprises.

	The rapid development of the Yulin Diesel Engine Factory is attributed to its relentless pursuit of technological advancement. In 1985, when the 6105 swirl-type diesel engine for cars was selling well in the market, the factory collaborated with the Shanghai Internal Combustion Engine Research Institute to convert the swirl-type to a direct-injection type. This new diesel engine, representing the technology of the 1980s, was recognized by the National Machinery Commission as an excellent energy-saving product and was popular both domestically and internationally. In 1987, the factory further advanced to develop the 6110 diesel engine, which is smaller in size, lighter in weight, and produces less pollution. This engine is expected to be mass-produced next year. Over the past five years, the factory's product range has expanded from over 10 types to 37 types.

    瞄准新产品 年年有创造
    玉林柴油机厂快步发展
    本报讯　记者刘衡报道：广西玉林柴油机厂从1984年到1988年，五年五大步：产值和税利分别以年均46％和71％的幅度递增。今年1到8月，产值完成5100万元，税利2190万元，分别是去年同期的2.3倍和15.7倍。人均创税利和全员劳动生产率已经双双超过国家一级企业的年度标准。
    玉林柴油机厂的快步发展得益于该厂不断追求技术进步。1985年，当6105涡流式车用柴油机在市场畅销无阻时，该厂就和上海内燃机研究所共同研究，把涡流式改为直喷式。这种80年代水平的新型柴油机，被国家机械委认定为优秀的节能产品，畅销国内外。1987年，该厂又赶超国际水平，研究体积小、重量轻、污染更小的6110柴油机，明年就可大批量地投入生产。5年来，该厂新产品已由10多种发展到37种。
