People's Daily, Tokyo, October 9th - Correspondent Yu Qing reports: To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Beijing and Tokyo becoming sister cities, and through the joint efforts of both cities, the largest economic and trade expo held by Beijing overseas opened today in the Tokyo Industrial Trade Center.

The couplets written by Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and Tokyo Governor Suzuki Toshiichi, "Cooperation is most valuable with sincere dedication, friendship requires a touch of chivalry," are well-matched and thought-provoking, adding to the atmosphere of the expo.

The expo covers an area of over 5,000 square meters and is divided into five sections: friendly exchanges between Beijing and Tokyo; an introduction to Beijing's foreign economic and trade situation; export product displays and sales, foreign trade negotiations, and import-export orders; an introduction to Beijing's traditional culture and tourism resources; and on-site performances and exchanges of calligraphy, seal cutting, and clay figurines.
