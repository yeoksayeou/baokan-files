The second round of the World Team Chess Championship saw intense competition among the 10 top teams. The African combined team, generally considered the weakest, defeated the third-place team from the Olympic Chess Tournament, the Netherlands. The China team drew 2-2 with the Americas champion, Cuba.

Today, the China team, consisting of Ye Jiangchuan, Xu Jun, Liang Jinrong, and Wang Zili, faced off against four grandmasters from the Cuba team. The match began at 3 PM and lasted over three hours. Wang Zili from the fourth board was the first to secure a victory, defeating his opponent, Villa.

On the first board, Ye Jiangchuan and Nogueras battled for over four hours, ultimately ending in a draw. Xu Jun's match against Rodriguez saw Xu taking the initiative and gaining an advantage early on, but he failed to maintain it and eventually made a losing move. On the third board, Liang Jinrong's match against Garcia was the most grueling, lasting the longest. Garcia took the initiative, and Liang was at a disadvantage throughout. However, Liang put up a fierce resistance. The match started at 3 PM and ended at 9 PM, with neither side able to secure a victory. The final score was a 2-2 draw between the China team and the Cuba team.

Today, the African combined team caused an upset by winning 1-3 against the Netherlands team. Despite the Netherlands team's best efforts, they lost one board and the remaining three boards fought to the last pawn but still could not turn the tide.

Additionally, the Soviet team defeated the U.S. team with a score of 2-2; the Yugoslavia team defeated the host Switzerland team with a score of 1-3; and the UK team drew with the Hungary team. Tomorrow, the China team will face the African combined team here.

　　国际象棋世界团体赛第二轮较量
　　中国队2∶2战平古巴队
    新华社卢塞恩10月29日电  （记者施光耀）参加第二届国际象棋世界团体锦标赛的10支劲旅今天在此展开了第2轮较量，被普遍认为实力较弱的非洲联队战胜了奥林匹克团体赛第3名荷兰队，中国队战平古巴队。
    今天，中国队由叶江川、徐俊、梁金荣和汪自力迎战美洲冠军古巴队的4位国际特级大师。比赛从下午3点钟开始，3个多小时以后，中国队4台的汪自力首奏凯歌，战胜对手维拉。
    1台上，叶江川与诺盖拉斯经过4个多小时的格斗，最后战成和局。徐俊与罗德里盖斯的一战，徐俊先行，并一度取得优势，但未能保持优势，直至最后失招。3台上，梁金荣对加尔西亚一仗打得最艰苦，耗时也最长。这盘棋加尔西亚先行，梁一直处于劣势，但抵抗得非常顽强。从下午3点战到晚上9点，双方不见胜负，最终以打成平手。中国队和古巴队2∶2的比分战平。
    今天，非洲联队爆出冷门，以1胜3和战胜荷兰队。尽管荷兰队尽了最大努力，除一台败北以外，其余3台都一直拚杀到最后一个兵，但仍然未能挽回败局。
    此外，苏联队以2胜2和胜美国队；南斯拉夫队1胜3和胜东道国瑞士队；英国队与匈牙利队打成平局。明天，中国队将在这里迎战非洲联队。
