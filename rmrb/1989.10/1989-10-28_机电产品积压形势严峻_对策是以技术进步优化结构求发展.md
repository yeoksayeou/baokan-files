Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 27th.

The current market is sluggish, and the machine-electrical product market is particularly prominent. By the end of August, the total inventory of machine-electrical products nationwide had reached 22.24 billion yuan, an increase of 61.4% compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that the demand for machine-electrical products in the market next year will further decline. Preliminary statistics show that currently, the orders for next year that machine-electrical enterprises have in hand only account for 20% of the annual plan, whereas in previous years, this figure would typically reach 60-70% by this time.

The ongoing National Conference on Science and Technology and Quality of the Machine-Electrical Industry has revealed the above situation. Vice Minister of the Machine-Electrical Industry Department, He Guangyuan, said in his speech that the machine-electrical industry is currently facing severe challenges and tests. It must rely on technological progress, improve product levels and quality, optimize product structure, and use these means to overcome difficulties and seek development. The conference will make specific arrangements for how machine-electrical enterprises can accelerate technological progress, improve product levels and quality.

He Guangyuan believes that the current difficulties and opportunities coexist in the machine-electrical industry. First, many industries in the machine-electrical sector provide equipment for key development sectors such as energy and transportation. According to the policy of "maintaining some and suppressing others," the product structure should continue to be adjusted to develop products that the market needs. Second, the export of machine-electrical products may still see significant growth. From January to August this year, according to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade statistics, the export of machine-electrical products has reached 4.78 billion US dollars, an increase of 40% compared to the same period last year. Third, the import substitution of machine-electrical products will significantly increase. In the future, efforts should be made to "lead with science and technology, focus on quality, optimize industrial and product structure," and focus on promoting technological progress in large and medium-sized enterprises, accelerating the commercialization of scientific and technological achievements.

　　机电产品积压形势严峻
　　对策是以技术进步优化结构求发展
    本报北京10月27日讯　记者皮树义报道：当前市场疲软，机电产品市场尤为突出。到8月底止，全国机电产品库存总额已达222.4亿元，比去年同期增长61.4％。预计明年机电产品市场需求还将下降。据初步统计，目前机电企业到手的明年订货合同仅占年计划的20％，而往年到这个时候一般都达到60—70％。
    正在举行的全国机电工业科技与质量工作会议透露了上述情况。机电部副部长何光远在讲话中说，机电工业正面临着严峻的挑战和考验，必须依靠科技进步，提高产品水平和质量，优化产品结构，以此来闯难关，求发展。会议将对机电企业如何加快技术进步、提高产品水平和质量做出具体部署。
    何光远认为，目前机电工业困难与机遇并存。一是机电工业的许多行业是为能源、交通等重点发展部门提供装备的，根据有保有压的方针，应继续调整产品结构，发展市场需要的产品。二是机电产品出口仍可能有较大增长。今年1至8月按经贸部统计，机电产品出口已达47.8亿美元，比去年同期增长40％。三是替代进口的机电产品将明显增加。今后应“以科技为先导、以质量为主线，优化产业和产品结构”，着重推进大中型企业的技术进步，加速科技成果商品化。
