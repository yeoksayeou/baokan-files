Recently, the county committee and the county government of Changning County announced the decisions on the handling of a batch of officials who had serious violations of regulations and discipline and issues of building houses for personal gain that were uncovered in the previous period:

The deputy director and deputy secretary of the county People's Congress Standing Committee, Qin Lǐcháng, expanded the land area for building his private house without authorization. He also used his power for personal gain, underpaid construction fees by 3533 yuan, and exchanged 14 tons of residential coal from the county coal company for green tiles, making a profit of 365.1 yuan. His errors were serious. Approved by the municipal committee, it was decided to give him the punishment of removing his position as deputy secretary of the county People's Congress Standing Committee and to recommend that he be removed from his position as deputy director of the county People's Congress Standing Committee through legal procedures. All underpaid fees must be paid in full, and illegal profits will be confiscated. He will also be fined for the excess land he occupied for building his house.

The director and secretary of the county Economic Commission, Lǐ Zézōu, seriously used his power for personal gain while building his private house and received a serious warning within the party. It was also recommended that he be administratively removed from his position as director of the county Economic Commission.

The deputy secretary of the county Central District Committee, Liú Shūqiáng, used his power for personal gain to build a house, amounting to 9981.44 yuan, which caused a bad influence among the people. He received the punishment of being placed on probation within the party for two years and must return all the fees in full, demolish the wall, and return the excess occupied area.

The former deputy secretary of the city's Chengguan Town Committee, Xǔ Qúnguāng, who engaged in deception, used his power for personal gain, and built a house against the regulations, received the punishment of being placed on probation within the party for one year. The private house he built will be acquired by the county real estate company as a commercial property. At the same time, he must also return the fees for personal gain amounting to more than 3000 yuan.

The county discipline inspection commission also filed cases for investigation against four officials, including the secretary of the county New District Committee, Yáng Jiāfǎ, and the director of the county Light Industry Bureau, Huáng Gōnglóng. The county people's procuratorate arrested four economic criminals, including Wang Rónghuá, the manager of the Changning County branch of the Bank of China, who sold pesticides for building private houses, and Guō Xiùxū, who embezzled public funds to build private houses. The county committee and the county government also made arrangements for the next phase of how to do a good job in the house-cleaning work.

The announcement of these handling decisions has caused a stir in the county. Some people reflected: This time, the house-cleaning work is not just "thundering," but it has also started "raining."

    常宁县以权谋私建房的干部被处理
    最近，我县县委和县政府公布了对前一段清查出来的一批有严重违章违纪、谋私建房问题的干部的处理决定：
    县人大常委会副主任、党组副书记秦礼常在营建私房中擅自扩大占地面积，还以权谋私，少付施工费等3533元，用县煤炭公司的居民生活煤14吨串换青瓦，牟利365.1元，错误严重。经市委批准，决定给予他撤销县人大常委会党组副书记职务的处分，并建议按法律程序罢免他县人大常委会副主任职务。各种少付的款项要如数交清，非法牟利予以没收，对他多占土地建房处以罚款。
    县经委主任、党组书记李泽洲在营建私房中，严重以权谋私，受到党内严重警告处分，并建议行政撤销他县经委主任职务。
    我县央田区委副书记刘书强，为建房以权谋私金额达9981.44元，在群众中造成恶劣影响，受到留党察看两年的处分，并须如数退赔各种款项，拆除围墙，退出超占面积。
    弄虚作假、以权谋私、顶风建房的我县城关镇原镇委副书记许群光受到留党察看一年的处分，所建私房将由县房产公司征收为商品房。同时，他还要退赔谋私款3000多元。
    县纪委还对我县新洲区委书记阳加法、县轻工业局局长黄宫龙等4名干部立案审查。县人民检察院拘捕了为建私房倒卖农药的中国银行常宁县支行行长王荣华和贪污公款营建私房的郭秀珪等4名经济犯罪分子。县委、县政府还就下一段如何搞好清房工作作了部署。
    这些处理决定的公布，在我县引起了震动。一些群众反映：这次清房工作不光是“打了雷”，而且开始“下雨了”。
