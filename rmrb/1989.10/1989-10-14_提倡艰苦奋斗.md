When we talk about "hard work and self-denial," it seems both familiar and unfamiliar. It is familiar because it is a cherished tradition of our Party and our country. It is unfamiliar because for some time, the phrase "hard work and self-denial" has not been heard much, and even when mentioned, some people consider it "inappropriate." Meanwhile, wasteful and extravagant practices are spreading in society, and a culture of indulgence is on the rise. This serious situation not only casts a shadow over our economic life but also corrupts the minds of some people.

Advocating for hard work and self-denial means promoting a valuable social ethos and a spirit of striving and progress. With this ethos and spirit, people will have the courage and confidence to face difficulties and navigate complex environments, thereby achieving success in their endeavors.

Advocating for hard work and self-denial is also a decision based on our country's actual situation. On one hand, our country is still not wealthy and has a weak foundation. On the other hand, building the country and improving the lives of the people require a large amount of financial and material resources. Especially now, our economy faces many difficulties, which requires all sectors to work hard and live frugally. The behavior of extravagant waste is only detrimental to our cause.

Advocating for hard work and self-denial helps Party members and cadres pass the tests of power, reform and opening up, and materialism, avoiding special privileges. This will help to combat the current corruption, promote clean governance, and enhance the political quality of Party members and cadres. It will also help to strengthen the relationship between the Party and the people.

Hard work and self-denial are not just empty words. Currently, all sectors must use limited funds in the most needed areas and completely change the bad habits of showing off, flaunting wealth, excessive eating and drinking, and wasteful spending. We must adhere to the principle of thrift and oppose waste. In the production process, we must improve quality, reduce consumption, and pursue efficiency. For personal life, we must live within our means and practice frugality. These all need to start from small things and from oneself.

### 提倡艰苦奋斗

    提倡艰苦奋斗
    提起“艰苦奋斗”，似乎觉得它既熟悉又陌生。说它熟悉，是因为这是我们党和国家的一个传家宝；说它陌生，是因为一段时间以来，“艰苦奋斗”这个词儿不大听到了，即使提及，也被有的人认为“不合时宜”。而社会上却是挥霍、浪费现象不断蔓延，奢糜之风日盛。这种严重的状况，不仅给经济生活罩上了一层阴影，而且腐蚀了一些人的心灵。
    提倡艰苦奋斗，就是提倡一种可贵的社会风尚，提倡一种拚搏进取的精神。有了这种风尚和精神，人们在困难面前，在复杂的环境中，就有了勇气和信心，就能取得事业的成功。
    提倡艰苦奋斗，又是从我们国家的实际情况出发决定的。一方面我国还不富裕，底子薄；一方面搞建设、改善群众生活需要大量财力、物力，尤其目前我国经济上还存在许多困难，这就要求各行各业只能艰苦创业，过紧日子。那种铺张浪费的败家子行为，只会贻误我们的事业。
    提倡艰苦奋斗，使党员、干部过好权力关、改革开放关、物质关，不搞特殊化，这就有助于克服目前存在的腐败现象，推动廉政建设；有助于密切干群关系，提高党员、干部的政治素质。
    艰苦奋斗不是一句空话。当前，对各条战线来说，要把有限的资金用在最需要的地方，把讲排场、比阔气、大吃大喝、铺张浪费的坏风气彻底改变过来。要贯彻节约的原则，反对浪费。在生产过程中，要提高质量，降低消耗，讲求效率。对个人生活来说，要量入为出，节俭度日。这些同样需要从点滴做起，从自身做起。
