Huoqiu County, Anhui, and Miluo City, Hunan, have reported several incidents of violent resistance to tax collection this year. These incidents highlight the seriousness of the problem and the need for effective measures to address it.

In Huoqiu County, Anhui, there have been eight instances of tax officials being assaulted while on duty. Unfortunately, some of the perpetrators have not received appropriate punishment.

On March 18, a female tax official, Yin Quan Yun, from the Shidian Tax Bureau, was assaulted while on duty in Shidian Old Street. She discovered that an individual merchant, Zhou Wenqiang, was transporting 12 tons of rice without paying the necessary taxes. When Yin attempted to collect the taxes, Zhou grabbed her by the collar and pushed her towards the vehicle. The local police fined Zhou 2,080 yuan, but he refused to pay.

On May 26, tax collection agent Lei Zhongguo was assaulted while checking vehicles on Shidian Street. He found that an individual merchant, Liang Xiuyuan, from Niuji Township, was illegally transporting grain. Liang immediately attacked Lei, who was hospitalized for half a month. The perpetrator was only required to write a letter of repentance and pay a fine of 100 yuan.

On July 17, tax collection officer Zhou Yinghua from the Chengjiao Tax Bureau was assaulted while collecting taxes from an individual merchant, Wang Zhen, in Caodun Street. Wang not only refused to pay taxes but also pushed Zhou to the ground.

In Miluo City, Hunan, similar incidents have occurred during a tax collection audit. Qu Yuan Sugar Factory's painter, Wu Fengquan, operated an individual painting business without registering with the tax authorities. On August 28, tax officials from the Qu Yuan Tax Bureau, including Ren Qinxue and Xie Zhuangliang, visited Wu's residence four times to deliver a self-inspection form, but it was ignored. After assessing his business income, Wu was found to owe 750 yuan in back taxes. Despite this minimal assessment, Wu refused to pay, and his two sons pushed Ren, causing injuries.

In another incident, a young fish vendor, He Zheng, from Qu Yuan Town, pushed his bicycle into tax official Chen Jianhui while being assessed for 50 yuan in back taxes. He kicked Chen and declared, "I won't pay a single cent in taxes." Additionally, tax official Zheng Weipu from the Taolin Tax Bureau was assaulted while collecting 15 yuan in taxes from an individual merchant, Wong Zhongping, from Fanjiayuan Township. Wong's wife scratched Zheng, causing injuries to his nose, face, mouth, armpit, and neck.

Tax officials are being assaulted and verbally abused while performing their duties, which is outrageous. We urge the government and relevant departments to take effective measures to stop this trend and maintain normal tax collection procedures and national interests.

　　暴力抗税不容忽视
    安徽霍丘县广播站李平　赵勇来信：今年以来，我县已发生殴打税务干部的事件8起，有些打人者未受到应有的惩处。
    3月18日，石店区税务所女税务干部殷全云在石店老街执行公务时，发现个体户周文权贩运12吨稻谷，当即拦车要周文权补交税款。周文权不但不交税款，反而跳下车，一把抓住殷全云的衣领，向车头猛推。事发后，区派出所处以周文权2080元罚款，但周分文不交。
    5月26日，税务代征员雷中国在石店街道检查过往车辆时，查出牛集乡个体户梁修元私自贩运粮食。梁修元下车后举手就打，雷中国被打伤，住院半个月，而打人者只受到写悔过书、罚款100元的处分。
    7月17日，城郊税务所税收员周英华向曹墩街道个体户汪珍征收税款时，汪珍拒不纳税，还将周英华打倒在地。
    湖南汨罗市霍东华、钟剑文来信：在今年开展的税收清查中，湖南汨罗市连续发生无理殴打税务干部的严重事件。
    屈原糖厂油漆工吴凤泉，1987年留职停薪（向厂部上交管理费）开办个体油漆经营业务，没有办理税务登记手续。今年8月28日，汨罗市税务局屈原镇税务所任勤学、谢庄良等3人先后4次上门送去自查表，被置之不理，后核定其1月营业额为1500元。按10个月计算，吴凤泉应补税750元。这本来是最低限的补税额，但吴凤泉仍不接受，吴的两个儿子还将任勤学推倒致伤。
    屈原镇青年鱼贩何政在税务干部陈建辉核定补交50元税款时，竟蛮横地推着自行车撞人，并狠踢陈建辉一脚，当众声称：“一分钱的税也不补。”桃林税务所干部郑维厚在收取范家园乡个体户翁中平的15元税款时，也被打得鼻青脸肿，嘴巴流血，腋部和颈部被翁的妻子抓伤。
    税务干部依法收税，竟累遭殴打谩骂，令人愤慨。吁请政府与有关部门采取有效措施，坚决制止这股歪风，以维护正常的税收秩序和国家利益。
