After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, China's situation is stable and is developing towards greater stability. People see that a new political situation of stability and unity has emerged; temporary economic difficulties are being overcome, and the momentum of national economic development continues to be good; the rectification and deepening of reform are proceeding steadily and effectively; the market is bustling, people's minds are stable, and social order, work order, and living order have returned to normal; the tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee are being earnestly and promptly implemented.

In recent years, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the importance of stability and unity, saying: "The key issue for China is stability. Without a stable environment, everything will be in vain, and the achievements we have made will be lost. Our country needs reform, and reform must have a stable political environment. Without this, nothing can be accomplished." Comrade Xiaoping's remarks highly summarize the most critical issue for China, reflecting the highest interests of the Chinese nation. Now, looking back at the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing during the spring and summer, and recalling Comrade Xiaoping's series of important speeches on stability and unity, we feel deeply moved. Our country has not been out of the ten years of turmoil for long, and it is still in a state of recovery; with such a vast territory and a large population, we cannot afford to be in chaos again. If we are in chaos, we will not have the energy to carry out reforms and construction, which will affect the realization of the great goal of the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China. Stability and unity are the overall situation. As long as our country is united, the people are united, and society is stable, even if we develop steadily for several decades, China will undergo fundamental changes.

At present, the people of all ethnic groups in the country are striving under the leadership of the Communist Party of China to achieve the modernization development goals proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress and the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. There is no doubt that to achieve these goals and complete these tasks, we still need a stable and united political environment. This is an important prerequisite. Therefore, all comrades in the Party, all the people of the country, especially those in charge of leadership work, must pay great attention to this issue and strive to eliminate all factors that are not conducive to stability, further consolidate and develop the hard-won political situation of stability and unity.

The bourgeois liberalization trend of thought is the source of the turmoil. In recent years, our country's political situation has experienced some turmoil because the Four Cardinal Principles were not consistently adhered to, and the bourgeois liberalization trend of thought was not resolutely opposed. This lesson must be learned. Bourgeois liberalization is to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. To ensure the long-term stability and prosperity of the Party and the country, we must use this opportunity to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing to seriously carry out the investigation and rectification work and must not go through the motions. Those who engaged in beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing must be resolutely investigated and brought to justice without leniency. Those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance and do not repent must be resolutely expelled from the Party to ensure the purity of the Party's organization. The more thorough this work is done, the more guaranteed the stability and unity will be. For comrades who have made general mistakes by being involved in the turmoil to varying degrees, the main approach is to criticize and educate them to help them recognize their mistakes and change their stance. We will not repeat the "leftist" practices of the Cultural Revolution. The Party's policy and principle of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "clearing up thoughts and uniting comrades" should be better implemented. We must further promote socialist democracy, actively promote political system reform, and strive to create a lively and vigorous political situation in which there is both concentration and democracy, both discipline and freedom, and both a unified will and individual comfort in the Party and in various aspects of social life.

Maintaining the relative stability and continuity of the current policies is an important link in consolidating and developing the political situation of stability and unity. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, our Party and government have repeatedly reiterated that the line, principles, and policies formulated by the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee are correct, and the "one center, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth National Congress are correct. From the development strategy to the principles and policies, there will be no change. The ten years of reform and opening up have achieved tremendous successes recognized by the world. The national economic strength and the living standards of the people have greatly improved during these ten years. Such a series of policies that are in line with the interests and wishes of the people and have been proven correct by practice, how can they change? Not only will they not change, but they will also be better implemented on the basis of summarizing experience, making the cause of reform and opening up more stable, faster, and better. China will not go back to the old path. The old path is unpopular and unworkable. We need to correct the mistakes of not consistently adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and not resolutely opposing bourgeois liberalization, so that the two hands can be more coordinated, and the cause of reform and opening up can develop more smoothly. Economic work remains the central task of the whole Party. We must ensure that the economy does not slide and must have a sustained, stable, and coordinated development. The rectification and deepening of reform we are currently carrying out is to create better conditions for further deepening the reform, so it is completely necessary. We must grasp it with confidence and strive to achieve results. On this basis, we must do a better job of deepening the reform. All reform and opening-up measures issued before the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, which have been discussed and decided by the Central Committee or the State Council, have been formulated into regulations and laws by the State Council, and have been formulated into laws by the National People's Congress, must continue to be implemented. Policies, especially those major policies that have emerged in recent years in the process of reform and opening up, have been proven by practice to be in line with the level of development of China's productive forces, and can promote the development of productive forces, should not be changed at will. Some specific policies, if there are problems in the implementation process and need to be adjusted, should be reported to the original decision-making body for approval after sufficient investigation and research, and then be adjusted and changed. New reform measures, if they are proven to be reasonable through scientific demonstration and effective and universally significant through experimentation, can be promoted and popularized. This is completely necessary for stabilizing people's minds, stabilizing the team, stabilizing the economy, and stabilizing the political situation.

At present, our work faces some new contradictions and new problems. Handling and solving these contradictions and problems well is also an important aspect of eliminating destabilizing factors. For example, we advocate considering the overall situation, with individual interests subordinated to the collective and long-term interests of the state, but at the same time, we must fully consider the immediate interests of the masses and care about the lives of the masses; we must resolutely solve the problems of unfair distribution that the masses are very dissatisfied with, but at the same time, we must not go back to the old way of "eating from the same big pot" and strive to reflect the principle of distribution according to work; we must resolutely eliminate those unhealthy spiritual garbage, but at the same time, we must promote the creation of more and better spiritual food, occupy the ideological and cultural front with socialist thoughts, and improve the cultural life of the people. In short, we must adhere to dialectics, prevent one-sidedness, and be good at handling various contradictions. If not handled well, the masses will be dissatisfied, and small matters can also lead to big incidents.

Through the bloody struggles of countless patriots and 40 years of hard work, China has finally transformed from a weak and poor country into an independent, strong, and initially prosperous and flourishing Eastern giant. The Chinese people, who have suffered many hardships, are more soberly aware than ever that only a stable and united China can be a China with strength and hope. China needs stability and unity, and China must be stable and united. The whole Party and the people of the whole country must be more closely united to maintain the political situation of stability and unity and to better promote the socialist modernization of the motherland!

    维护安定团结这个大局
    平息北京发生的反革命暴乱后，中国的局势是稳定的，而且正朝着更加稳定的方向发展。人们看到：新的安定团结的政治局面已经出现；暂时的经济困难正在被克服，国民经济的发展继续保持好势头；治理整顿和深化改革稳妥地、富有成效地推进；市场繁荣，人心稳定，社会秩序、工作秩序和生活秩序恢复如常；党的十三届四中全会提出的各项任务正在扎扎实实地抓紧落实。
    这些年来，邓小平同志曾多次语重心长地谈到安定团结问题，他说：“中国的问题，压倒一切的是需要稳定。没有稳定的环境，什么都吹了，已经取得的成果，也会失掉。我们国家要改革，要改革就一定要有稳定的政治环境，离开这一点，什么都搞不成。”小平同志的讲话，高度概括地指出了中国最关键问题之所在，反映了中华民族的最高利益。现在，回顾春夏之交发生在北京的动乱直至反革命暴乱，重温小平同志关于安定团结的一系列重要讲话，倍感亲切。我们的国家从十年动乱中摆脱出来时间不长，大病初愈；幅员又这么大，人口这么多，再也不能乱了。乱，就没有精力去搞改革，搞建设，就会影响到实现四化、振兴中华的远大目标。安定团结是大局。只要我们的国家是统一的，人民是团结的，社会是稳定的，即使平平稳稳地发展几十年，中国也会发生根本的变化。
    现在，全国各族人民正在中国共产党的领导下，为实现党的十三大提出的现代化发展目标和十三届四中全会提出的各项任务而努力奋斗。毫无疑问，要实现这些目标，完成这些任务，仍然需要一个安定团结的政治环境。这是个重要的前提条件。因此，全党同志、全国人民，特别是担负领导工作的同志要十分重视这个问题，务求清除一切不利于稳定的因素，进一步巩固和发展来之不易的安定团结的政治局面。
    资产阶级自由化思潮是动乱之源。这些年，我们国家的政局几次出现某种动荡，就是因为坚持四项基本原则不够一贯，对资产阶级自由化思潮未能旗帜鲜明地加以反对。这个教训一定要吸取。资产阶级自由化，就是反对中国共产党的领导，反对社会主义制度。为了保证党和国家长治久安，我们要利用这次制止动乱和平息北京发生的反革命暴乱的机会，认真抓好清查和清理工作，决不能走过场。对那些打、砸、抢、烧、杀的反革命暴徒要坚决清查出来，绳之以法，决不手软。对那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场而又不肯改悔的人，要坚决清除出党，以保证党的组织的纯洁性。这个工作做得越彻底，安定团结就越有保证。对于不同程度卷入动乱、犯有一般错误的同志，主要是通过批评、教育，促使其认识错误，转变立场。我们不会重复“文化大革命”中那种“左”的做法。我们党的“惩前毖后，治病救人”、“既要澄清思想，又要团结同志”的方针和政策要更好地实行。我们要进一步发扬社会主义民主，积极推进政治体制改革，努力在党内及社会生活各方面造成一种既有集中又有民主，既有纪律又有自由，既有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅那样一种生动活泼的政治局面。
    保持现行政策的相对稳定性和连续性，是巩固和发展安定团结政治局面的重要一环。平息北京发生的反革命暴乱后，我们的党和政府多次重申，党的十一届三中全会制定的路线、方针、政策是正确的，党的十三大概括的“一个中心、两个基本点”是正确的，从发展战略到方针政策都不会变。十年改革开放取得了举世公认的巨大成就。国民经济实力和人民生活水平在这十年中有了很大的增强和提高。这样一系列符合人民利益和愿望的、被实践证明是正确的政策怎么会变呢？不仅不会变，而且要在总结经验的基础上，把改革开放的事业搞得更稳、更快、更好。中国绝不会走老路。走老路是不得人心的，是走不通的，我们要纠正的是坚持四项基本原则不够一贯、反对资产阶级自由化不够坚决的失误，使两手配合得更加协调，使改革开放的事业能够更顺利地发展。经济工作仍然是全党的中心工作。要确保经济不滑坡，而且要有一个持续、稳定、协调的发展。我们现在所进行的治理整顿是为进一步深化改革创造更好的条件，因而是完全必要的。要理直气壮地抓，务求取得实效。在这个基础上，要把深化改革的工作搞得更好。党的十三届四中全会以前出台的各项改革开放措施，凡是经过中央或国务院讨论决定的，经国务院制定了条例、法规的，经过人大制定了法律的，都要继续贯彻执行。政策，特别是近年来在改革开放中应运而生的、业已被实践证明是符合我国生产力发展水平的，能够促进生产力发展的各项大的政策，不能随意改变。有些具体政策，在执行过程中确有问题，需要调整的，要在充分调查研究的基础上，报请原决策机关批准后，再予以调整和改变。新的改革措施，经过科学论证确实是合理的，并经过试验证明确实是有效和有普遍意义的，才能宣传和推广。这样做，对于稳定人心、稳定队伍、稳定经济、稳定政局是完全必要的。
    当前，我们的工作中面临着一些新的矛盾、新的问题。把这些矛盾和问题处理好、解决好，也是消除不安定因素的一个重要方面。比如我们提倡顾全大局，个人利益服从集体和国家的长远利益，但同时也要充分地考虑群众的切身利益，关心群众的生活；我们要切实解决群众意见很大的分配不公等问题，但同时也不能走吃“大锅饭”的老路，力求体现按劳分配的原则；我们要坚决扫除那些不健康的精神垃圾，但同时也要繁荣创作，提供更多更好的精神食粮，用社会主义思想占领思想文化阵地，使人民群众的文化生活切实得到改善。总之，要坚持辩证法，防止片面性，善于把各种矛盾处理好。如果处理不好，群众不满意，小事也可以酿出一些大的事端。
    经过无数志士仁人的浴血奋战和40年来的艰苦奋斗，中国终于从一个积弱积贫的国家变成独立、强大、初步繁荣昌盛的东方巨人。饱经忧患的中国人民比以往任何时候都更加清醒地看到，只有安定团结的中国，才可能是一个有力量、有希望的中国。中国需要安定团结，中国必须安定团结。全党和全国人民更加紧密地团结起来，为维护安定团结的政治局面，更好地推动祖国的社会主义现代化建设而共同努力！
