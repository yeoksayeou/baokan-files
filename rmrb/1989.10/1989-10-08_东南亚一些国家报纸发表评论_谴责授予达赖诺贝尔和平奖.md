Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 7th.

Newspapers in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines today pointed out that the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to award the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama is an interference in China's internal affairs.

The editorial in Singapore's *Lianhe Zaobao* said that this year's Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to the Dalai Lama, who is in exile, is "laughable" and "childish."

The editorial stated that the Nobel Peace Prize Committee's praise of the Dalai Lama is equivalent to openly supporting his movement to secede from China, and it also openly indicates that they believe Tibet does not belong to China.

Thailand's *Chung Hua Daily* published an editorial stating that the Nobel Committee's decision to award the Dalai Lama the Peace Prize "cannot escape the accusation of interfering in China's internal affairs and attempting to split China's territory," and it will undoubtedly face strong protests and condemnation from all Chinese people.

The Philippines' *Business News* published a commentary stating that the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to award the Dalai Lama the Peace Prize at this time is an attempt to encourage his fantasy of independence. From this point of view, the Nobel Committee arrogantly undermines China's unity and interferes in China's internal affairs.

    东南亚一些国家报纸发表评论
    谴责授予达赖诺贝尔和平奖
    据新华社北京10月7日电  新加坡、泰国和菲律宾报纸今天指出，挪威诺贝尔委员会决定授予达赖喇嘛1989年和平奖是对中国内政的干涉。
    新加坡《联合早报》社论说，今年的诺贝尔和平奖颁给流亡国外的达赖喇嘛，“令人啼笑皆非”，“真是如同儿戏”。
    这篇社论说，诺贝尔和平奖委员会如此表扬达赖喇嘛，就等于公然支持他脱离中国的运动，也就等于公开表明他们认为西藏并非属于中国。
    泰国《中华日报》发表社论指出，诺贝尔委员会授予达赖和平奖之举“难逃干涉中国内政，企图分裂中国领土的谴责”，必将受到所有中国人的强烈抗议和谴责。
    菲律宾报纸《商业新闻》发表评论说，挪威诺贝尔委员会在此时决定授予达赖喇嘛和平奖是企图鼓励他的独立幻想。从这点看，诺贝尔委员会蛮横地破坏了中国的统一，干涉了中国的内政。
