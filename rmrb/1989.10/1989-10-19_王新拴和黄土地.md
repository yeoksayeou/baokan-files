At the foot of Guan Tou Shan, in Xiaotun Village, Hejin Town, Lin County, Henan, Wang Xinshuan, a model farmer, is leading his family in harvesting wheat. The harvested wheat fields are flowing with water. The corn, which has been interplanted, has just sprouted, and the tender shoots and leaves are stretching out after absorbing water.

Just by looking at this scene, one can tell that he is a skilled farmer.

Wang Xinshuan has half an acre of contracted land on the east bank of the Taoyuan River, beneath which lies a thick layer of river sand. Some people are willing to buy this sand at a price of 14 to 15 yuan per cart. Wang Xinshuan's values are different from others. In his view, sand has a price, but land is priceless. Selling sand by destroying the land is disrespectful to both his ancestors and future generations. Many people have come to buy the sand, but no deals have been made.

If others can't buy it, can relatives? A relative of Wang Xinshuan came to him with this idea, but he also got a flat refusal. This year, his eldest son is building a house and also asked him to dig sand from that half acre of land.

Wang Xinshuan's face is stern, saying, "Destroying the land to dig sand is not allowed. If you need sand, I will sieve it for you from the riverbank."

Wang Xinshuan is heartbroken when people destroy the land; he also cherishes the land destroyed by nature. In the year the Taoyuan River flooded, a piece of land on the west bank, about 2.8 acres, was covered with stones up to 30-40 centimeters thick. The village wanted to lease out this land for 25 kilograms of corn per year, but several people who were mobilized refused. In 1983, Wang Xinshuan took on this land, cleared the pebbles. In 1985, he harvested 350 kilograms of wheat and over 300 kilograms of corn from this land. Others said, Wang Xinshuan made a fortune on this land.

We came to the edge of this land and saw that the peanut plants were as large as a seven-inch plate, with leaves green and lush, and the ground was clean with not a single weed. The corn at the edge of the field was half a person's height. The bean vines and pumpkin vines crawled up the slope in a large area. Wang Xinshuan, with his sincere love and sweat, filled this piece of yellow earth with vitality.

    王新拴和黄土地
    刘法修  徐可风
    在拐头山下，河南林县合涧镇小屯村爱地模范户王新拴正带领全家赶收小麦。收获后的麦田里，流水淙淙。套种的玉米刚出土，幼芽嫩叶吸水后正使劲伸展。
    一看这情形就知道他是种庄稼的好把式。
    王新拴有半亩多责任田分在桃园河东岸，下面压着厚厚一层河砂。有人愿意按每车十四五元的价格买这砂子。王新拴的价值观与众不同。在他看来，河砂有价土无价，毁地卖砂既对不起先人也对不起后代。买砂人来过不少，生意却一笔也没成交。
    别人买不成，亲戚用点可以吧？王新拴有个亲戚抱着这样的想法找他商量，结果也碰了一鼻子灰。今年他的大儿子盖房，也向他提出要到那半亩地下面挖砂。
    王新拴的面孔铁板硬，说：“毁地挖砂不行，用砂我到河滩给你筛。”
    人为毁地，王新拴心疼；大自然毁掉的地，他也珍惜。桃园河涨水那年，河西一块2.8亩大小的地，河水冲上去的石头有三四十厘米厚。村里以每年交25公斤玉米为条件，想把这块地包出去，动员了几个人都不干。1983年王新拴揽下了这块地，清理了鹅卵石。1985年他在这块地上收小麦350公斤，玉米300多公斤。别人说，王新拴在这块地发了财。
    我们来到这块地边，看见地上的花生秧有七寸菜盘那样大，叶子青翠欲滴，地上干净得没有一棵杂草，地头的玉米有半人高。地边的豆秧、南瓜秧爬上山坡一大片。王新拴用他赤诚的爱和汗水，使这块黄土地充满生机。
