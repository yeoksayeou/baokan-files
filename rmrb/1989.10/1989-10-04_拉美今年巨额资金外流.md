A report released by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean states that the outflow of capital from Latin America this year is expected to reach 35 billion U.S. dollars, marking the highest level of capital outflow since the debt crisis in 1982.

The report, titled "Economic Situation in Latin America in 1989," notes that if the momentum from the first half of this year continues, Latin America will experience a trade surplus for three consecutive years. However, due to the need to pay off substantial foreign debt interest, the trade surplus in the region will once again be offset this year.

The report highlights that the already limited foreign exchange reserves of Latin American countries have been depleted to the point where they cannot be further reduced. This has led to an increase in the number of countries that have defaulted on their due foreign debts in the first half of this year. Currently, only Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay are still making payments on their foreign debts.

    拉美今年巨额资金外流
    联合国拉美和加勒比经济委员会在此间发表的一份报告说，今年拉美地区外流资金将高达三百五十亿美元，为一九八二年拉美发生债务危机以来资金外流最高的年份。
    这份名为“一九八九年拉美经济形势”的报告指出，如果继续保持今年上半年的势头，拉美将连续三年扩大外贸顺差。但是，由于支付巨额外债利息，今年该地区的贸易盈余将再次被抵消。
    报告指出，拉美国家原本不多的外汇储备已减到不能再减少的地步，从而使今年上半年拖欠到期外债国家数目增加。目前，实际上只有哥伦比亚、智利、墨西哥和乌拉圭还在支付外债。
