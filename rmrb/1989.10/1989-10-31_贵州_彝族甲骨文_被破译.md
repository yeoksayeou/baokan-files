The "Yi Ethnic Group's Oracle Bones Script" in Guizhou has recently been deciphered by Wang Zhengxian of the Guizhou Institute of Nationalities and Wang Ziyao of the Yi Script Research Room at Guizhou Nationalities Institute.

51 symbols resembling pictographs but with more complex variations were discovered during two excavations in 1978 and 1979 at the Zhongshui Han Tomb Group in Weining County, which is home to the Yi, Hui, and Miao ethnic minorities. These symbols were carved on some pottery and pottery shards, dating back over 2,000 years. They are currently the oldest carved script on pottery unearthed in Guizhou, hence scholars have referred to them as the "Yi Ethnic Group's Oracle Bones Script."

Over the years, many experts and scholars have studied these carved symbols, but none have been able to fully decipher and interpret them.

Wang Zhengxian said that they began their research in 1981 and have finally unraveled the mystery of the "Yi Ethnic Group's Oracle Bones Script."

Through these carved symbols, they not only clarified the identities, status, character, and causes of death of the Yi ancestors buried in the tombs but also confirmed that as early as the middle of the Warring States period, the ancient Yi people were living in the border regions of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. They had entered a highly stratified slave society. Their pottery-making and brewing industries had reached a relatively high level. At the same time, the Yi script was widely used in funeral and sacrificial rituals.

Experts believe that the deciphering of the "Yi Ethnic Group's Oracle Bones Script" provides extremely valuable firsthand materials for studying the ancient Yi social structure, economic characteristics, the dating of the creation of the Yi script, the funeral and sacrificial rituals of the Yi ancestors, and various taboos. Additionally, since the Zhongshui area of Weining is within the jurisdiction of the ancient Kingdom of Yelang, its deciphering also provides important references for studying the social structure of the ancient Kingdom of Yelang.

　　贵州“彝族甲骨文”被破译
    新华社贵阳10月30日电　（记者石新荣）贵州“彝族甲骨文”最近被贵州民族研究所王正贤和贵州民族学院彝文研究室王子尧破译。
    51个类似象形文字却变化更为非富的刻划符号，是1978年和1979年两次在贵州威宁彝族回族苗族自治县中水汉墓群发掘中获得的。这些符号刻在一些陶器和陶片上，距今已有2000余年的历史，是目前贵州出土的年代最为久远的刻划陶文，因而被有关学者称为“彝族甲骨文”。
    数年来，研究这些刻划符号的专家学者不少，但谁都未能完全识读，并作出解释。
    王正贤说，他们从1981年开始研究至今，终于解开了“彝族甲骨文”的谜底。
    他们通过这些刻划符号，不仅弄清了墓中彝族先民们生前的身份、地位、人品和死因，还证实了早在战国中期，彝族古代先民就生活在云贵川三省的交界地区，并进入了等级森严的奴隶社会。其制陶、酿酒等手工业已具有较高水平。同时，彝文在丧葬祭祀上已得到普遍应用。
    有关专家认为，“彝族甲骨文”的破译，为研究古代彝族社会形态、经济特点、彝文创造时间的断代、彝族先民的丧葬祭祀及各种禁忌，提供了极为珍贵的第一手资料。同时，由于威宁中水地区属古夜郎国的统治范围，它的破译，也为古夜郎国的社会形态研究提供了重要的参考。
