According to a joint forecast by economists from the Nordic countries' industrial associations, the economic growth rate of the Nordic countries will remain significantly lower than the average growth rate of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over the next one or two years.

The report predicts that due to factors such as rising inflation rates, the economic growth rate of the Nordic countries has been lower than the OECD average since 1987.

This year, the economic growth rate in the Nordic region is expected to be 1.9%, while the OECD average growth rate is projected to be 3.5%. Next year, the economic growth rate in the Nordic countries is expected to drop to 1.3%, significantly lower than the OECD's 3% growth rate. This year, the average inflation rate in the Nordic countries is expected to reach 5.7%, and next year it is expected to be 5.1%, both higher than the OECD average inflation rate. This year, the average unemployment rate in the Nordic countries is expected to be 4.3%, and next year it is expected to be 4.4%.

Due to differences in economic policies, the economic development situations in the Nordic countries are quite different.

The governments of Finland and Sweden are moving towards reducing controls, while Denmark and Norway continue to implement policies of tightening domestic demand and improving the balance of payments. As a result, the former has seen a significant increase in domestic demand and industrial investment, leading to overheating of production, increased imports of goods and services, and a high inflation rate. The latter has seen an improvement in the balance of payments and increased export competitiveness. Iceland is currently facing a cyclical economic recession, with economic growth turning negative starting last year. This year, the negative growth is expected to reach 3.5%, and next year it is projected to be 2.5%.

    北欧国家经济增长缓慢
    据北欧国家工业协会经济学家联合预测，北欧国家的经济增长率在今后一二年内仍将明显低于经合组织国家的平均增长率。
    预测报告说，由于通货膨胀率升高等原因，北欧国家的经济增长率从1987年开始一直低于经合组织平均增长率。
    今年北欧地区经济增长率将为1.9％，而经合组织平均增长率预计为3.5％。明年北欧经济增长率将下降为1.3％，将大大低于经合组织3％的增长率。今年北欧的平均通货膨胀率将达5.7％，明年将达5.1％，都高出经合组织平均通货膨胀率。今年北欧平均失业率将达4.3％，明年将达4.4％。
    由于经济政策不同，北欧国家的经济发展情况也很不相同。
    芬兰和瑞典政府的政策趋向于减少控制，丹麦和挪威继续执行紧缩国内需求，改善国际收支的政策。其结果，前者国内需求明显地增加，工业投资也增加，生产发展过热，进口商品和劳务增长，通货膨胀率保持在较高水平，后者国际收支情况有所改善，出口竞争力增强。冰岛正面临周期性经济衰退，经济增长从去年开始出现负增长，今年负增长将达3.5％，明年预计负增长2.5％。
