The mountains are home to the Yao people, the mid-hills to the Hani, and the plains to the Dai. Like brothers, we gather in the great family of the nation.

This is a folk song of the Hani people, sung by the elders of my hometown as they carry their plows and oxen along the winding paths of the fields, resonating through the mountains and valleys.

My hometown is on the southern bank of the Red River in Yunnan, in the majestic and verdant Ailao Mountains. Here, the forests are dense, the flowers and grasses are fragrant, and cattle and sheep roam freely. The Hani, Yi, and Dai peoples have lived here for generations. The elders of my hometown, with their hard work and wisdom, have created the terraced fields of Ailao, which resemble countless silver ladders, following the contours of the mountains from the foot to the peak.

The Hani, Yi, and Dai peoples of my hometown have always lived in harmony, like one family. The tradition of "cow in-laws" and "horse in-laws" has been passed down through the generations.

The climate in the Ailao Mountains is mild, but the temperature difference between the mountains and the plains is significant. Agricultural activities in the plains begin earlier than in the mountains. The Hani and Yi people living on the mid-hills and the Dai people living in the plains help each other with labor, sharing resources and jointly developing production. The custom of "cow in-laws" arose from this practice.

Generally, "cow in-laws" involve the Dai people in the plains on one side and the Hani or Yi people on the mid-hills on the other. One side has a cow, and the other has a bull. After selecting suitable partners and negotiating on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, the bull and cow are paired, and this relationship is usually not changed, much like human betrothals. Thus, the two sides become in-laws. In the spring, when the plains are lush with grass, the cattle and horses are cared for by the Dai in-laws. At this time, it is the season for early rice planting, and the cattle and horses are used by the Dai in-laws. In the summer, when the Hani and Yi people on the mid-hills are planting mid-season rice, the cattle and horses are managed and used by them. In the winter, when the mountains are cold, the cattle and horses return to the plains to spend the winter. This arrangement benefits both production and livestock care. The calves and foals born are shared by both sides, and any profits from selling or slaughtering them are also shared. Through this common labor and interaction, a deep bond is formed. During the ten years of turmoil, this traditional custom was disrupted. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party's policy on nationalities has been restored, and the customs of "cow in-laws" and "horse in-laws" have been revived. In recent years, under the Party's policy of enriching the people, production in my hometown has developed, and this "in-law" relationship has further tightened the bonds between the various ethnic groups, from production to daily life.

### “牛亲家”“马亲家”

    “牛亲家”“马亲家”
    赵官禄（哈尼族）
    高山的瑶家，半山的哈尼，河坝的傣家，
    亲如兄弟哟，在祖国民族大家庭里汇合。
    这是家乡的父兄们扛着犁耙，吆着耕牛，行走在蜿蜒的田间路上引吭高歌，震响山野的一首古朴的哈尼族民歌。
    我的家乡在云南红河南岸巍峨苍郁、层峦叠嶂的哀牢山区。这里森林茂密，花草芬芳，牛羊遍地。哈尼族、彝族、傣族等各族人民世世代代居住在这个富饶美丽的地方。家乡的父兄们用勤劳智慧开凿的哀牢奇景——梯田，像万道银梯，依着山势，从山脚直挂山顶。
    家乡的哈尼族、彝族、傣族同胞，一向和睦相处，亲如一家，历史上搭“牛亲家”、“马亲家”的习俗，一直沿袭到今。
    哀牢山区气候温和，但山上山下气温相差较大，坝子里的农事季节比山上来得早。住在山腰上的哈尼族、彝族同胞，就和住在坝子里的傣族兄弟变工互助，互通有无，共同发展生产，“牛亲家”的习俗就是在这样的基础上形成的。
    一般说来，搭“牛亲家”是以坝子里的傣族为一方，以半山上的哈尼族或彝族为另一方；一方有母牛，另一方有公牛。物色好对象之后，经过平等互利的协商，自愿把公牛和母牛配成一对，这种关系确定下来后，一般不予改变，就像人们定亲那样，以此两方便成了亲家。春天，坝子里水草丰茂，牛马就由傣族亲家喂养，那时正好是早稻播种时节，牛马就归傣族亲家使用；夏天，正是半山腰上的哈尼族、彝族兄弟种中稻的时候，牛马就由他们管理和使用；冬天，山上气候冷了，牛马就回到坝子过冬。这样，既有利于生产，又有利于牲畜保养，生下的牛崽和马驹，归双方所有，将来买卖或宰杀，利益均沾。双方在这共同的劳动和交往中，建立起深厚的感情。在十年浩劫期间，这种传统的美俗遭到了破坏。党的十一届三中全会以来，党的民族政策回来了，“牛亲家”、“马亲家”又恢复起来。近几年来，在党的富民政策指导下，家乡的生产发展了，这种“亲家”关系，把各族人民的利益，从生产到生活更加紧密地联系在一起。
