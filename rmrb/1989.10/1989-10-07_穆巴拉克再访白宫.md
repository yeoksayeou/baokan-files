**International Outlook**

Egyptian President Mubarak shakes hands with President Bush for the second time at the White House on October 2. The political climate in the Middle East is no longer as tense as it was half a year ago when they first met.

This spring, Mubarak visited the U.S. without bringing any specific plans, instead he outlined the Arab stance on negotiations in principle. The U.S. invited the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and Israel to discuss, listening more than speaking, cautiously taking small steps. Bush only put forth four principles at the White House Rose Garden as a response, which were essentially ending the Israeli occupation; "land for peace"; realizing the political rights of the Palestinian people; and ensuring Israel's security. However, it was still unclear how to start solving the Middle East problem.

Half a year later, Mubarak visits the White House again, with a clear goal: the Middle East peace process should start with direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis. Egypt, in response to Shamir's election plan, proposed a 10-point "implementation plan," which is to have the "two sides sit down at the dialogue table first."

President Mubarak reminded the outside world to pay attention, "dialogue is not negotiation, the two are very different." Dialogue means not setting any preconditions, and then talk about it. He revealed that the issues he discussed with Bush were approved by PLO Chairman Arafat, and the list of Palestinian representatives he brought was also agreed upon by Arafat, and they "are not members of the PLO." The Egyptian president, based on the constructive stance of Egypt and the Palestinians, urged the U.S. to actively promote direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis, and the Bush administration should have no objections.

In fact, the U.S. government has repeatedly expressed agreement with the Egyptian plan, but each time it emphasized that the dialogue must lead to the final implementation of Israel's Shamir election plan. The underlying message is still against holding an international Middle East peace conference at this time. The common point between Egypt and the U.S. is to first open the channel for direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis.

The Middle East situation is thus becoming more active. On the Arab side, Egypt takes the lead, communicating and consulting with each other. Some express support, some observe quietly, and some still hold doubts, but as the direct party in the dispute, Chairman Arafat expressed in Tokyo that the results of the Mubarak and Bush meeting in Washington are "very positive."

The international community attaches great importance to Egypt's mediation role. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, in a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Arens, expressed support for Palestinian-Israeli talks and urged Arens to participate in direct dialogue with the PLO. At the same time, he recently wrote a letter to Chairman Arafat, saying that if the PLO does not participate in the negotiations, a solution to the Middle East problem will never be reached. Western European countries have long made their stance on promoting Middle East peace talks clear, generally valuing the mediation of Arab countries like Egypt.

After the Egypt-U.S. talks in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Baker made a thought-provoking statement. He said, "The Middle East peace process now depends on the results of the Israeli cabinet meeting. If the Likud and Labor parties cannot agree on the Egyptian plan, we will have to start over." According to the analysis, his words have two meanings. One meaning is that the Western media's claim that "the U.S. is putting pressure on Israel" and "urging Israel to agree to direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis" may be true. Bush had already expressed in February this year that the U.S. hopes that the parties involved in the Middle East will "take action first" and does not want to easily take the lead. The Egyptian plan is a "breakthrough opportunity," and the Washington Post has already revealed this meaning. But no one will overlook its other meaning, which is to understand that if the Israeli cabinet accepts direct dialogue, it will face the serious consequence of internal division, and it is better to drag it out for a while. This is clearly giving Israel a way out and also leaving room for itself.

The Israeli cabinet's Likud and Labor factions face a crucial choice on whether to accept direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis. Rabin, the Defense Minister valued by the U.S. and Egypt, is said to be a "more flexible opponent than Shamir and a stronger opponent than Peres." Rabin's visit to Cairo to discuss dialogue issues with Mubarak indicates that the Israeli cabinet is changing. There have already been reports that Shamir has proposed preconditions for easing his opposition to direct dialogue: first hold an Egyptian-Israeli summit; the Palestinian side fully accepts Shamir's plan. It seems that the Israeli cabinet still wants to make an issue out of minor matters, avoid the main topic of Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, or simply follow Baker's old path: drag it out.

### 穆巴拉克再访白宫

    穆巴拉克再访白宫
    本报记者　林皎明
    埃及总统穆巴拉克10月2日在白宫与布什总统第2次握手，中东政治气候已不似半年前他俩第1次会面时那样乍暖还寒。
    今春，穆巴拉克访美时“没有携带具体方案”，而是原则性地阐述了阿拉伯和谈立场。美国把埃、约、以3国领导人请到家里会谈，听的多，说的少，谨慎迈小步。布什在白宫玫瑰园仅仅拿出4点原则立场作为回报，不外乎是结束以色列占领；“土地换和平”；实现巴勒斯坦人民政治权利；保障以色列安全。然而，中东问题的解决从何处下手，却还是渺茫的。
    半年后，穆巴拉克再访白宫，会谈目标十分明确：中东和平进程眼下要从巴以直接对话开始。埃及针对沙米尔选举计划提出的10点“实施方案”，就是要求“巴以双方先在对话桌前坐下来”。
    穆巴拉克总统提醒外界注意，“对话不是谈判，两者有很大区别”。对话，就不要提什么先决条件，谈起来再说。他透露，他与布什所谈问题，得到巴解组织主席阿拉法特的“允诺”，所携的巴勒斯坦代表团人员名单“也取得阿拉法特同意”，而且他们“不是巴解组织成员”。埃及总统基于埃巴双方颇具建设性的立场要求美国积极推动巴以直接对话，布什政府似不该再有异议。
    事实上，美国政府多次对埃及方案表示趋同，只是每次表态都强调对话必须导致以色列沙米尔选举计划的最终实施。潜台词仍旧是反对目前召开中东和平国际会议。埃美立场的共同点在于，首先打通巴以直接对话渠道。
    中东目前时局由此出现活跃势头，阿拉伯一方，由埃及牵头，相互通气磋商。有的表示支持，有的潜心观察，有的仍然持怀疑态度，但作为争端直接的一方，阿拉法特主席在东京表示，穆巴拉克与布什华盛顿会谈结果“非常积极”。
    国际社会对埃及的中介作用相当重视。苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽会见以外长阿伦斯，表示苏支持以巴会谈，督促阿伦斯参与同巴解的直接对话。同时，他最近写信给阿拉法特主席，说如果巴解不参加谈判，就永远不会达成中东问题的解决方案。西欧国家力促中东和谈的立场早已明确，普遍看重由埃及这样的阿拉伯大国从中斡旋。
    埃美华盛顿会谈后，美国国务卿贝克有一番耐人寻味的表态。他说，“中东和平进程现在寄希望于以色列内阁会议的结果，如果利库德集团与工党对埃及方案僵持不下，我们不得不从头开始。”据分析，他的话有两层含意。一层意思是，西方新闻界所说的“美国在向以色列施加压力”，“敦促以色列同意巴以直接对话”。这可能是事实。布什在今年2月就表示过，美国希望中东当事人“首先采取行动”，不愿轻易站到前台来。埃及方案正好是“突破时机”，《华盛顿邮报》已点破这个意思。可谁也不会忽视它的另一层含意，即理解为如果以色列内阁接受直接对话就将承受内部分裂的严重后果，不如再拖一段时间。这分明是给以色列开一条后路，也为自己留下回旋余地。
    以色列内阁利库德、工党两派是否接受巴以直接对话，面临关键抉择。被美国和埃及看重的拉宾国防部长，据说是“比沙米尔灵活、比佩雷斯强硬”的对手。拉宾能到开罗与穆巴拉克谈对话问题，表明以内阁在起变化。已经有消息传出，沙米尔为松动反对直接对话的立场提出先决条件：先召开埃以首脑会谈；巴勒斯坦方面全盘接受沙米尔计划。看来，以色列内阁还要在枝节问题上作文章，绕开巴以对话的主题，或者索性走贝克的老路：拖。（本报开罗10月5日电）
