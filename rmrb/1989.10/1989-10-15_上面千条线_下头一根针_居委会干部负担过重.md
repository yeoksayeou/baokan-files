Residents' committees are grassroots self-governing organizations that play a crucial role in social management. They have been praised by international friends as a "jewel" with Chinese characteristics. Recently, I visited the heads of the Yuanzhong and Jinhua residents' committees in Shanghai's Huangpu District, Nanjing East Road Subdistrict. They not only discussed the achievements and role of residents' committees but also highlighted the issue of excessive workload for lane committee members.

The Yuanzhong and Jinhua residents' committees have a total of 263 residential buildings with 1,693 households and over 6,000 residents. The lane committee staffing, including the health station, consists of 20 people, with 4 full-time stipend holders and the rest being retired workers hired on a contract basis. Among them, there are 19 women and 1 man, with an average age of 57.

These individuals are responsible for handling the following numerous tasks:

1. **Overloaded Workload**: Lane committee work can be summarized into eight categories and over 60 items, including social order and comprehensive management, environmental sanitation, ideological and political work, civilized construction, civil affairs and welfare, supporting the military and caring for veterans, convenience and benefits for residents, and women's affairs. Taking environmental sanitation as an example, there are over 100 days a year designated for major sanitation campaigns. During these times, they assist every household in turning over bins and cleaning out mosquito and fly breeding grounds. They organize residents to exterminate rats and cockroaches. They also maintain the cleanliness of 136 buildings' balconies, courtyards, and public spaces. The entire area's drains are flushed or cleared of accumulated filth and sewage pipes are unclogged several times a year. To keep the area tidy and attractive, they paint 24 lanes and 79 civilized buildings white once a year. They also constantly remind residents not to raise chickens, ducks, and other poultry. Truly, from the heavens above to the drains below, from major to minor, everything needs to be managed.

2. **Various Indicators**: 1. Family planning with no second child. 2. No deaths from disputes. 3. No major criminal cases. 4. No fire alarms from fire prevention propaganda. 5. No minor pests from major sanitation efforts.

3. **Unmanageable Inspections and Meetings**.

4. **Endless Forms to Fill Out**.

5. **Seals to Stamp on Endless Documents**.

6. **Numerous Organizational Structures**.

The multitude of work, excessive inspections, meetings, forms, etc., have tied the hands and feet of lane committee members, affecting their ability to wholeheartedly serve the residents. They appeal for the restoration of the original purpose of lane committee work.

    上面千条线　下头一根针
    居委会干部负担过重
    居民委员会是群众自治组织，在社会管理中发挥着极为重要的基石作用，曾被国际友人视为具有中国特色的一颗“明珠”。最近，我访问了上海市黄浦区南京东路街道元中、金华居委会的负责同志。他们除了谈到居委会工作的成绩、作用外，还讲到里弄干部负担过重的问题。
    元中、金华两个居委会共有263居民幢1693户，6000多居民。里弄干部的配备包括卫生站在内共20人，其中正式在职津贴干部4人，其余都是聘用退休职工，19名女同志，1名男同志，平均年龄为57岁。
    这些同志要完成、应付以下众多事情：
    一、超负荷工作量。里弄工作可归纳为社会治安综合治理、环境卫生、思想政治工作、文明建设、民政福利、拥军优属，便民利民、妇女等8大类、60多项工作。仅举环境卫生一例，全年有100多天是大卫生季节，要帮助家家户户翻缸倒罐，清除蚊蝇孳生地。组织居民灭鼠、灭蟑螂。要为136幢房子的晒台、天井、公用场地整理堆物，保持环境整洁。全地区阴沟一年数次都要冲洗，或清除积污，疏通下水道。为了美观整洁，每年要为24条支弄，79幢文明楼刷白一次，还要时刻留意劝阻居民不喂养鸡鸭家禽等。真是上至天文宇宙，下管阴沟、垃圾，事无巨细，样样要管。
    二、各式各样的指标。1、计划生育无二胎。2、调解纠纷无死亡。3、治安防范无大案。4、宣传防火无火警。5、大搞卫生无小害。
    三、不胜应付的检查和会议。
    四、填不完的各种表格。
    五、盖不完的证明图章。
    六、名目繁多的组织机构。
    繁多的工作，过多的检查、会议、表格等，束缚了里弄干部的手脚，影响了他们一心一意为居民办实事的可能性。他们呼吁要恢复里弄工作的本来面目。
