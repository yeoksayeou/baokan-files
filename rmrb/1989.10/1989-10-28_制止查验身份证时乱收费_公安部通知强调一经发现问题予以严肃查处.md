Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 26th.

The Ministry of Public Security recently issued a notice requiring an immediate halt to arbitrary fines and fees during the inspection and verification of residents' ID cards.

The notice states that since the nationwide implementation of the resident ID card usage and inspection system on September 15, 1989, most regions have executed the policy well. However, there are some issues. In particular, some public security organs have arbitrarily fined and charged citizens who do not carry their resident ID cards, creating a negative impact. Some citizens have reported that they have already applied for their ID cards, but due to the slow work of the public security organs, they have not received their cards in time and were still fined during inspections.

The notice reiterates relevant regulations, requiring all levels of public security organs to grasp the policy and punishment limits, and to formulate corresponding punishment execution scopes and standards. It emphasizes the need to strictly stop arbitrary fines and fees during the inspection and verification of resident ID cards. In the current stage, for citizens who do not carry their resident ID cards, the focus should be on propaganda, criticism, and education. For those who have not yet received their cards, temporary measures should be taken to solve their identity verification problems. All regions should continue to accelerate the issuance of cards, shorten the production cycle, and deliver the cards to the citizens as soon as possible.

The notice points out that anyone who takes advantage of their position to deliberately infringe upon the lawful rights of the citizens must be seriously investigated and dealt with upon discovery, and necessary administrative disciplinary actions must be taken. If the circumstances are serious and constitute a crime, criminal responsibility should be pursued in accordance with the law.

　　制止查验身份证时乱收费
　　公安部通知强调一经发现问题予以严肃查处
    新华社北京10月26日电  公安部近日发出通知，要求立即制止在居民身份证查验、核查工作中乱罚款、乱收费的现象。
    通知说，自1989年9月15日全国开始实施居民身份证使用和查验制度以来，大多数地区的执行情况是好的，但是也存在一些问题。特别是少数公安机关在查验工作中对没有随身携带居民身份证的群众，随意进行罚款和收费，造成了不良影响。有的群众反映早已办理了申领手续，但由于公安机关工作跟不上，没能将证件及时发给他们，在查验时也被罚了款。
    通知重申了有关规定，要求各级公安机关注意掌握政策和处罚界限，并制定相应的处罚执行范围和标准，坚决制止在查验和核查居民身份证工作中乱罚款、乱收费。在现阶段，对未随身携带居民身份证的群众，应以宣传和批评、教育为主；对尚未领到证件的群众，应采取临时变通的办法解决其证明身份问题。各地应继续加快发证步伐，缩短制证周期，将证件尽快发到群众手里。
    通知指出，凡是利用工作之便故意侵害群众合法权益的，一经发现，必须严肃查处，给予必要的行政纪律处分；情节严重构成犯罪的，应依法追究刑事责任。
