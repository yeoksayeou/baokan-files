Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 30th.

The members of the 7th National People's Congress Standing Committee's 10th session have continued their group discussions on the reports from the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Supervision regarding the implementation of the two courts' announcements and the fight against corruption, bribery, and other corrupt practices.

One hand grasps reform and opening up, the other hand punishes corruption is very correct

Commissioner Yi Mei Hou said, after listening to the reports from the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Supervision, he deeply felt that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions on our need to "always adhere to one hand grasping reform and opening up, the other hand punishing corruption" and the Politburo's decision on doing a few things that the people care about in the near future are very correct and timely. The announcement by the two high courts has been warmly supported by the broad masses of the people, quickly forming a new high tide in the fight against corruption, bribery, and other corrupt practices. Since the announcement was issued more than two months ago, due to the close cooperation of the courts, public security, judicial, supervision, and other relevant departments at all levels, and the joint efforts of the broad masses of public security and judicial personnel, this struggle has already achieved good results, uncovering a large number of cases of embezzlement, bribery, and speculative crimes. He hopes that the Party Central Committee and the State Council will continue this fight against corruption, bribery, and speculative criminal activities to the end, so that our country's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization construction will achieve greater success.

The anti-corruption fight has a good start, but the task is still very arduous

Commissioner Li Rui Shan said, regarding the reports from the two high courts and one department, his view is that a lot of work has been done and achievements have been made. But this is only a good start, the task is still very arduous and long-term. To grasp anti-corruption and clean governance to the end, there can be no relaxation. In addition to specialized agencies that need to work hard, party, government, military, and enterprise and institution leaders, as well as relevant organizations, personnel, and discipline inspection departments, must all work together to achieve better results. Although this work cannot be carried out as a mass movement, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and listening to the opinions of the masses is still necessary. Some necessary institutions should also be established. The recent regulations are good, and more regulations should be made for some aspects to facilitate execution and public supervision.

Commissioner He Jin Heng said, after listening to the reports from the two high courts and one department, he felt that the anti-corruption fight has already made some impact and achieved some results, and the trend of public spending on banquets has been somewhat curbed, with good feedback from the masses. But this is just a good start, more arduous and complex work lies ahead. This is because: 1. What has been touched so far are only surface-level, obvious criminals, while more cunning and deeply hidden criminals have not been touched. 2. Under the drive of desire and money, new criminals will continue to emerge. 3. Completely transforming society is not something that can be achieved in the short term. Based on the above situation, I think that strengthening clean governance and fighting economic crimes is very favorable at the moment, and it is necessary to continue to firmly and persistently carry out this work, with the momentum becoming stronger and the work becoming more detailed. Through this work, we can improve the image of the Party and the government and change social customs. Now we need to continue to deepen it, to grasp it level by level, to the end, so that those who try to change tactics and continue to embezzle have no place to hide. We should fully mobilize the masses to expose a large number of criminals. Because the masses have sharp eyes and understand the situation and problems.

Commissioner Wu Jue Tian said, the reports from the two high courts and one department are indeed a breakthrough, but there is still a lot more to be done. Why can't gambling be banned in some places? It is said that if you are caught gambling, you just pay a fine and continue to gamble. Why are there still many major cases that are not being handled? I think if the whole country and the whole Party are mobilized, this fight against embezzlement and corruption can still be done well.

Commissioner Wang Yong Xing said, the evaluation of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts should not be too high. Currently, in some places, anti-corruption is still a blind spot. According to the masses' feedback, some cadres (referring to bureau and division chiefs) have built houses that several generations can live in. These problems are quite complex, and these people's methods are also quite sophisticated. I think we need to put in a lot of effort to tackle this.

Commissioner Li Jian Bai said, regarding the current struggle, we need to have a correct assessment. The anti-corruption fight has just begun, and the curtain has just been raised. The announcement is about to expire, and the formal struggle will only truly begin after the expiration. More arduous and in-depth struggles lie ahead. From the three reports, it can be seen that currently, some local leaders do not pay enough attention to this work, and there is resistance in the investigation and handling process. Although we have grasped some clues, to investigate thoroughly, we still need to continue our efforts. I hope that the two high courts and one department will continue to work hard and definitely grasp this work well.

Commissioner Zhang Shi Ming said, I basically agree with the reports from the two high courts and one department. According to these reports, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-embezzlement have achieved some results, but the scale and momentum of the struggle are still not big enough. We need to further expand the momentum and mobilize the masses to cooperate with the two high courts and one department to carry out the struggle. We also need to further grasp some typical cases to form a deterrent effect, and deal with serious dereliction of duty by bureaucrats. We need to further absorb representatives from people's congresses and political consultative conferences at all levels to participate in the fight against corruption and embezzlement. I also agree with the suggestion of other commissioners to establish anti-corruption supervision committees at people's congresses at all levels, and this committee should absorb people from all walks of life to participate.

Commissioner Fu Kui Qing said, now, from the central government to local governments, from within the military to outside the military, we have all formulated some measures or regulations against corruption and maintaining integrity. The masses' feedback on these is very good. But everyone also has a saying, let's wait and see, to see if it is just a passing fad. Therefore, we must grasp these anti-corruption issues to the end, to implementation, and to achieve results. Leaders must take the lead in hard work and accept inspections and supervision, thereby truly deepening the anti-corruption fight. We must block all loopholes that produce corruption.

Commissioner Cao Long Hao said, from the facts revealed in the two high courts' reports, the number and amount of embezzlement, bribery, and speculative crimes are unprecedented in our country's history. The reasons are multifaceted, for example, some are exploiting loopholes in economic system reforms, some are taking advantage of the dual-track system to engage in bribery, embezzlement, and speculative activities, while we did not pay enough attention to this when making decisions. I suggest that leaders at all levels seriously reflect on the mistakes in their work, block all loopholes that produce corruption, and eliminate the root causes. When dealing with corrupt elements, we should consider the actual situation of the chaotic economic order in the past few years, combining leniency with severity, and handling some problems cautiously, such as distinguishing between bribery due to forced production and operation and other reasons, and considering specific situations when handling them.

Commissioner Chen Sheng Heng said, currently, in the fight against corruption, there is a trend of seeking favors. Who are the people seeking favors? What are the networks and some units that are not strict in enforcing discipline that interfere with the case handling work? Who interferes? Who puts pressure on the supervision agencies? What are the networks? I think we should grasp typical cases and publicly expose them, especially for leading cadres who know the law but violate it, we should publicly expose them. The supervision agencies should not hesitate to expose anyone, regardless of who is involved.

In the fight against corruption, measures should be taken to protect and reward informants

Commissioner Wang Yao Lun said, the two high courts and one department have done a lot of work in the fight against embezzlement, bribery, and speculative activities, achieving good results and effects. However, the development of the work is still very uneven and should not be overestimated. In many regions, especially backward regions, since the announcement by the two high courts was issued, there has not been a single embezzlement, bribery, or speculative criminal who has surrendered. The situation is very complex, and deeply hidden economic criminals are often powerful and influential people. The masses whisper behind their backs, but no one dares to report for fear of retaliation. It seems that for informants, we should further adopt protective and rewarding measures to promote righteousness and suppress evil.

For agencies that use fines instead of criminal penalties, the leadership should be held accountable

Commissioner Li Chong Hui said, many departments only give administrative or economic penalties to lawbreakers and violators, especially for speculative activities. For agencies that violate the law and arbitrarily use fines instead of criminal penalties, the leadership should be held accountable. Issues related to legal amendments should be resolved as soon as possible. However, relying solely on investigations is not enough, and we should also work on the system. I suggest that in the future, the financial departments of administrative and enterprise institutions should be under vertical leadership, not under the direct leadership of the unit's leaders. Afterwards, the discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels should also be under vertical leadership from higher levels, so that they can play a restraining role on their own units. We should fight corruption while improving various financial systems

Commissioner Jiang Ping said, in the fight against embezzlement and bribery, it is becoming increasingly important to improve financial and other systems. In Liu Fu Zhi's report, many cases of embezzlement amounting to 100,000 yuan involve grassroots accountants and bookkeepers. Currently, there are still many loopholes in the financial system, and the methods of using off-budget funds and using funds after contracting give embezzlement criminals opportunities. We should fight corruption while rectifying order, establishing systems, and improving management to block loopholes.

### 人大常委分组审议两高一部报告  反腐败斗争见成效  应继续深入抓到底

　　人大常委分组审议两高一部报告
　　反腐败斗争见成效
　　应继续深入抓到底
    据新华社北京10月30日电  出席七届全国人大常委会第十次会议的委员连日来继续分组审议最高人民法院、最高人民检察院和监察部关于贯彻两院《通告》，开展反贪污、贿赂等腐败现象的斗争情况的报告。
    一手抓改革开放、一手抓惩治腐败非常正确
    蚁美厚委员说，听了最高人民法院、最高人民检察院和监察部的三个报告后，深深地体会到邓小平同志关于我们“要始终坚持一手抓改革开放、一手抓惩治腐败”的指示和党中央政治局作出的关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定是非常正确和非常及时的。两高通告的发布，得到了广大人民群众的热烈拥护，迅速形成了一个严惩腐败，反贪污、贿赂斗争的新高潮。“通告”发表两个多月以来，由于各级人民法院、公安、司法、监察等有关部门的紧密配合和广大公安干警、司法人员的共同努力，这场斗争已经取得了较好的效果，查出一大批贪污、受贿和投机倒把犯罪的案件。希望党中央和国务院能把这场反腐败、反贪污受贿、反投机倒把犯罪活动的斗争进行到底，使我国的改革、开放和社会主义现代化建设事业取得更大成就。
    反腐败开端良好任务还非常艰巨
    李瑞山委员说，对两高一部的报告，我的看法是做了大量工作，取得了成效。但这仅是一个良好的开端，任务还非常艰巨，是长期的。要把反腐败、廉政建设一抓到底，不能有任何放松。这项工作除了专门机关要大力抓外，党政军、企事业单位领导，有关的组织、人事、纪检等部门也要一齐来抓，效果才可能好些。这项工作虽然不能搞群众运动，但依靠群众、发动群众、听取群众意见还是必要的。还要建立一些必要的制度。最近的几个规定就很好，应针对一些方面再做些规定，以便于执行和群众监督。
    贺进恒委员说，听了两高一部的报告，感到反腐败斗争已造成了一定声势，取得了一些成绩，公费吃喝风已有所收敛，群众的反映很好，但这只是开了一个好头，更艰巨、更复杂的工作还在后头。这是因为：1、当前所触及的只是表面的、明显的犯罪分子，而更狡猾、隐藏得很深的犯罪分子则尚未触及。2、在利欲和金钱的驱使下，还会产生新的犯罪分子。3、彻底改造社会不是短期能实现的。基于上述情况，我认为，加强廉政建设，同经济犯罪作斗争，当前形势很有利，有必要继续坚定不移、持之以恒地抓下去，声势应该越来越大，工作应该越做越细。通过这一工作来改进党、政府的形象，转变社会风气。现在要继续深入下去，要逐级抓，抓到底，使那些企图改变花招、仍然贪污的分子无藏身之地。应当充分发动群众，大量揭发犯罪分子。因为群众的眼睛是亮的，对情况和问题也是了解的。
    伍觉天委员说，两高一部报告确实是一个突破，但是做得还很不够。还有在地方上，为什么赌博禁止不了？据说赌钱抓到了就罚款了事，赌还照样赌。为什么还有不少大案、要案得不到处理？我看如全国全党都发动起来，还是可以搞好这场反贪污、反腐败斗争的。
    王永幸委员说，对反腐败、反受贿的估价不能过高。当前有的地方，反腐败还是死角。根据群众反映，有的干部（指司局长）修理的房子几辈人也够住。这些问题相当复杂，这些人的手段也比较高明。我认为要花大力气去抓。
    李剑白委员说，对于目前的斗争要有个正确的估计，反腐败斗争还是刚刚开始，刚拉开序幕。通告即将到期，到期后正式斗争才算真正的开始。更加艰巨、更加深入的斗争还在后头。从三个报告中可以看出，目前有些地方的领导对这项工作不重视，查处工作有阻力，虽然我们掌握了一些线索，但要查得彻底，还要继续努力。希望两高一部继续努力，一定要抓好这项工作。
    章师明委员说，我基本同意两高一部报告。根据这些报告来看反贪、反贿、反腐还是有一定成绩的，但是斗争的规模和声势还不够大，要进一步扩大声势，发动群众配合两高一部展开斗争。还需要进一步抓一些典型事例形成一种威慑力，对严重失职的官僚主义者也要处理。要进一步吸收各级人大代表、政协委员参与反贪污、反腐败的斗争。我也同意别的委员提出在各级人大设立反贪污监督委员会的建议，这个委员会要吸收各界人士参加。
    傅奎清委员说，现在，我们从中央到地方，从军内到军外，都已制定了一些反对腐败、保持廉洁的措施或规定。群众对这些反映是很好的。但是大家也有一句话，要拭目以待，看究竟是不是一阵风。所以，我们反腐败，就要把这些问题抓到底，抓落实，抓出成效来。领导要带头艰苦奋斗，带头接受检查和监督，从而真正把反腐败斗争引向深入。要堵塞产生腐败的各种漏洞
    曹龙浩委员说，从两高报告所揭露的事实看，贪污、贿赂、投机倒把分子数量之多、金额之大，都是我国历史上空前的。原因是多方面的，例如，有的在钻经济体制改革的空子，有的人利用双轨制之机会搞行贿受贿、投机倒把，而我们在决策时对此注意不够。建议：各级领导要认真反思工作中的失误，堵塞产生腐败的各种漏洞，铲除根源。对腐败分子处理时，要考虑前几年存在的经济秩序混乱情况的实际，宽严结合，有的问题处理要慎重，如行贿要分清因生产经营被迫，还是其他原因，处理时要考虑具体情况。
    惩治腐败要排除干扰
    陈邃衡委员说，现在惩治腐败中有说情风，究竟是什么人在说情？关系网以及一些单位执纪不严干扰了办案工作，什么人干扰？什么人对监察机关施加压力？有哪些关系网？我认为应抓住典型，予以公开揭露，特别是领导干部，知法违法，更要公开揭露，监察部门应拉下情面，不管涉及到什么人都要依法处理。谁说情、干扰就揭露谁。
    在惩治腐败斗争中要采取保护奖励举报人措施
    王耀伦委员说，两高一部在反贪污、受贿、投机倒把的斗争中，做了大量工作，取得了较好的成绩和效果。但是，工作发展还很不平衡，不能估计过高。不少地区，特别是落后地区，在两高通告发布至今，尚无一个贪污、受贿、投机倒把犯罪分子投案自首，情况十分复杂，隐藏深的经济罪犯多是有权有势的人，群众背地议论纷纷，但谁都不敢举报，怕受打击报复。看来对于举报人员，应当进一步采取保护和奖励措施，以弘扬正气，打击邪气。
    对“以罚代刑”的机关要追究领导责任
    李崇淮委员说，不少部门对违法乱纪的人只作行政或经济处罚了事，对投机倒把，尤为突出。对违反法律擅自以罚代刑的机关，要追究领导责任。涉及到法律修改问题，应该及早解决。但是，光靠查处还不够，还应在制度上下功夫。建议今后对行政和企事业单位的财会部门实行垂直领导，不由本单位主管领导。此后各级纪委和监察部门也应由上级垂直领导，这样可对本单位起制约作用。应边肃贪边完善各项财务制度
    江平委员说，在反贪污贿赂斗争中，完善财务等各项制度变得日益重要。刘复之同志报告中列举贪污数10万元的许多是基层会计、记帐员。现在财会制度上还有不少漏洞，计划外资金的使用办法、承包后的资金使用都给贪污犯罪以可乘之机。我们应该边肃贪，边整顿秩序、建立制度、完善管理，堵塞漏洞。
