Letters and Calls

Recently, rumors have been circulating in our area that the responsibility system for production and contracting has gone wrong, deviating from the socialist direction. It is said that the central government is planning to abolish the policy of the responsibility system for production and contracting, and restore the "three-level ownership, team as the base." There are also rumors that "the central and provincial governments are planning the steps for implementation." Farmers believe that the "big communal pot" is about to return, and at this time, if they increase investment in agriculture and sideline production, they will suffer personal losses. Therefore, farmers' enthusiasm for purchasing and adding agricultural materials has begun to decline, and some even do not want to accumulate or apply organic fertilizer...

Will the central government really change the policy of the responsibility system for production and contracting in rural areas? We hope to get a clear answer as soon as possible.

　　我们盼望明确答复
    最近，我们这里到处风传联产承包责任制搞错了，违背了社会主义方向，中央已准备取消联产承包责任制的政策，恢复“三级所有，队为基础”，还传说“中央和省里正酝酿实施步骤”。农民们认为马上又要搞“大呼隆”了，这时候再对农副业增加投入，个人就要吃亏。于是，农民购买和添置农用物资的热情开始下降，甚至连有机肥也不想积、不想施了……
    中央真要改变农村联产承包责任制的政策吗？我们盼望尽快得到明确答复。
