Author: Ma Ping
Date: 1989-10-24
Edition: 6

The symposium on historical themed creation, aimed at discussing issues related to the creation of historical themed works, was recently held in Guangyuan and Mianyang, Sichuan. More than twenty literary writers, critics, and editors from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Guangxi, and Sichuan participated in the meeting. The experts attending the symposium engaged in serious discussions on how to adhere to historical truth, use the past to serve the present, and educate through history under the guidance of Marxist historical materialism in historical themed creation. They also explored how to better apply artistic principles to make historical themes more narrative-driven, life-like, and emotionally resonant. This symposium was jointly organized by Guangxi People's Publishing House, Guangyuan Daily, and Guangyuan Writers' Association, with the Mianyang Federation of Literary and Art Circles co-organizing the event.
