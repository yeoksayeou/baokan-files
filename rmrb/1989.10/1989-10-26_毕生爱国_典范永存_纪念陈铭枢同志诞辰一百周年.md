Comrade Chen Mingxun was a renowned patriotic democrat, anti-Japanese general, political activist, and one of the founders of the China National Democratic Construction Association. His life spanned many major transformations in modern Chinese history. Throughout decades of political turmoil, he continually sought progress, walking the path from patriotism to socialism. His contributions to the democratic revolution and socialism are worthy of eternal remembrance.

Comrade Chen Mingxun, whose courtesy name was Zhenru, was born in Hepu, Guangdong. From a young age, he was concerned with national affairs and vowed to save the country. At 17, he enrolled in the Guangdong Whampoa Military Academy. There, he received revolutionary ideas from Dr. Sun Yat-sen and joined the Tongmenghui. Three years later, he and Chiang Kuang-nan transferred to the Nanjing Military Academy, where he actively engaged in revolutionary activities and became the external liaison officer for the Tongmenghui. He traveled to Hong Kong alone to coordinate with relevant parties, seeking to participate in the Guangzhou Uprising, but failed due to unforeseen circumstances. However, he had a significant influence among his classmates. After the Xinhai Revolution broke out, he mobilized a group of classmates to join the defense of Wuhan. Later, he entered the Baoding Military Academy but was wanted for participating in the anti-Yuan Shikai struggle.

In 1915, Chen Mingxun plotted to assassinate the Guangdong military governor Long Jiguang in Guangzhou. The plot was discovered, and he was arrested. With the help of comrades, he escaped from prison and fled to Japan. In 1920, he became the commander of the 4th Regiment of the 1st Division of the Guangdong Army. Deng Yanda, who was the commander of the direct-attached engineering regiment, and Chen Mingxun shared similar ideals and became close friends. In the spring of 1922, they both participated in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's first Northern Expedition. That summer, Chen Jiongming rebelled, and Chen Mingxun rushed back to rescue him, but his troops were disbanded en route. He refused to surrender and resigned from his command, changing his name to Zhenru and heading to Nanjing.

In early 1923, persuaded by Deng Yanda, Chen Mingxun returned to the 1st Division of the Guangdong Army under Li Jishen, where he served as the commander of the 1st Brigade and gained Li Jishen's favor. In early 1924, he supported Dr. Sun Yat-sen's reorganization of the Kuomintang, implementing the three policies of "Alliance with the Soviet Union, Alliance with the Communist Party, and Aid to Workers and Peasants," and realizing the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In 1925, he led his troops in the first Eastern Expedition to suppress Chen Jiongming, earning a distinguished record and being promoted to commander of the 10th Division of the 4th Army. He then participated in the second Eastern Expedition and the Southern Expedition against Deng Benyin, fighting all the way to Hainan Island.

In the summer of 1926, the Northern Expedition began. Chen Mingxun's 4th Army, with the Communist Party member Ye Ting leading the vanguard, marched from Guangdong into Hunan and directly into Hubei, defeating Wu Peifu's main forces. In famous battles such as Tingzai Bridge, he fought alongside Ye Ting and General Zhang Faku, achieving numerous victories. The 4th Army was thus renowned as the "Iron Army." After capturing Wuhan, Chen Mingxun served as the Wuhan Garrison Commander and Director of the General Political Department Training Department. Later, the 10th Division was expanded into the 11th Army, with Chen Mingxun as its commander. This period of shared life and destiny with the Communists had a profound influence on his later ideological development.

When the Japanese imperialists invaded Northeast China on September 18, the Chinese nation faced a life-or-death crisis. Chen Mingxun, then serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai Defense Command, advocated for resistance against Japan alongside the 19th Route Army leaders stationed in Shanghai, including Cai Tingkai, Chiang Kuang-nan, and Dai Jie. They opposed the Kuomintang government's policy of non-resistance. In early 1932, when the Japanese army launched an invasion of Shanghai, the 19th Route Army bravely resisted, marking the beginning of the "January 28" Battle of Shanghai. This battle lasted over a month, with the 19th Route Army's valiant fight causing heavy casualties among the Japanese, forcing them to change commanders multiple times and severely dampening the invaders' morale. The people of Shanghai spontaneously organized, contributing money and effort to support the front lines. The unity of the military and the people, their shared hatred for the enemy, and their efforts to defend Shanghai made significant contributions. This battle boosted the morale of the entire nation, promoting a nationwide anti-Japanese upsurge and gaining praise from progressive forces worldwide.

Due to the Kuomintang government's insistence on the reactionary policy of "expelling the external enemy first, then stabilizing the internal situation," Chen Mingxun was forced to resign. The 19th Route Army was also sent to Fujian to "suppress the Communists," which caused widespread discontent among the officers and soldiers. In January 1933, with the support of Chen Mingxun and others, the 19th Route Army signed a ceasefire agreement with the Central Red Army and later concluded a military agreement to jointly resist Chiang Kai-shek and fight against Japan. This marked the beginning of their cooperation with the Communist Party.

In November 1933, Chen Mingxun, Tan Ping Shan, Mei Gongbin, and other comrades, along with the 19th Route Army leaders Cai Tingkai and Chiang Kuang-nan, joined forces with Li Jishen, Feng Yuxiang, Chen Youren, Li Zhangda, and the Third Party members Huang Qixiang and Zhang Boqiong, to launch the Fujian Incident. They established the People's Revolutionary Government of the Republic of China, electing Li Jishen as chairman, and issued a declaration calling for the overthrow of the Nanjing government. According to the agreement, the Communist Party sent Pan Hannian and Zhang Yunyi from Ruijin to Fuzhou. Zhang served as the military representative, and Pan as the political representative. Chen Mingxun was one of the core leaders of this incident, serving as a member of the People's Government and the chairman of both the Cultural Committee and the Economic Committee, playing a crucial role in the Fujian Incident. This incident formally marked the organizational separation from the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Although the incident failed, it signified the further intensification of contradictions within the Kuomintang regarding the issue of resisting Japan or suppressing the Communists. It also signified the further gathering of patriotic democratic forces within the Kuomintang and their development to openly oppose the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, which was progressive in nature.

After the Fujian Incident, Chen Mingxun took refuge in Hong Kong and organized the Social Democratic Party. In 1935, the Social Democratic Party was reorganized into the Chinese National Revolutionary Alliance, actively responding to the Communist Party's call for unity against aggression and the August 1st Declaration.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, Chen served as a member of the Military Affairs Commission, leader of the China National Foreign Affairs Association, and the Chinese branch of the World Anti-Aggression Alliance. He supported the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, advocated for unity and resistance against Japan, and firmly opposed the reactionary stance of passive resistance and active suppression of the Communists. He also supported and participated in the anti-Japanese democratic movement at the time. He continuously exposed the atrocities of the Japanese army to the international community, calling for support from various countries to aid China's resistance against Japan.

In February 1943, with the support of the South Bureau of the Communist Party, Chen Mingxun, along with Tan Ping Shan, Liu Yazi, Wang Kunlun, Yang Jie, Guo Chuntao, and Zhu Yunshan, initiated the formation of the Three Principles of the People's League (abbreviated as Minlian) in Chongqing. They used discussions on current affairs to connect and unite patriotic democrats within the Kuomintang, welcoming the final victory of the War of Resistance against Japan. In 1945, after the signing of the Double Ten Agreement, Minlian held its first plenary session in Chongqing, officially announcing its establishment, with Chen elected as a standing committee member. During the old Political Consultative Conference, Minlian did much beneficial work, playing an active role in uniting patriotic democratic forces within the Kuomintang to oppose the civil war and strive for peace.

In November 1947, Chen Mingxun, at the invitation of Li Jishen and He Xiangning, went to Hong Kong to participate in the establishment of the China National Democratic Construction Association. In January 1948, the Minzhugong was established in Hong Kong, with Song Qingling elected as honorary chairman, Li Jishen as chairman, and Chen as a member of the Central Executive Committee. Upon its establishment, the Minzhugong raised the banner of "uniting with the Communists and opposing Chiang Kai-shek," fighting against Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship. Chen Mingxun, dispatched by the Minzhugong, returned to Shanghai to conduct liaison work, incite uprisings, and make unremitting efforts to collaborate with the People's Liberation Army's southward advance, aiming to disintegrate the military and political forces of the Kuomintang.

In September 1949, Chen, as a representative of Minlian, attended the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In his speech, he said, "We are willing to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary tradition and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, work with all democratic parties to build a new China." Like other patriotic democrats from the Kuomintang, Chen Mingxun followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's three policies, cooperated with the Communist Party for a long time, and accepted the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist direction in the critical historical turning point, making the correct choice.

After the founding of New China, Chen Mingxun served as a member of the Central People's Government, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Commission, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Minzhugong. He actively participated in the socialist revolution and construction, cared about the great cause of national reunification, and made many constructive criticisms and beneficial suggestions regarding government work. Even when he was once wronged and in adversity, he candidly expressed his views on domestic and international affairs, embodying the spirit of frankness with the Communist Party.

Chen Mingxun's life was one of patriotism and continuous progress. He was fair and outspoken, diligent in learning, and had deep knowledge in philosophy, military affairs, politics, culture, and even Buddhism. He had a wide circle of friends, with acquaintances both domestically and internationally. He was long active in China's military and political circles, having a significant influence among Kuomintang military and political personnel.

Chen Mingxun devoted his life to the people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism and to the construction of New China. He deeply understood that "only socialism can save China" and yearned for the early reunification of the motherland. As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of Chen Mingxun's birth, we should learn from his unyielding patriotism and strive to revitalize China and achieve national reunification.

　　毕生爱国  典范永存
　　——纪念陈铭枢同志诞辰一百周年
    屈武　朱学范　侯镜如
    陈铭枢同志是我国著名的爱国民主人士、抗日将领、政治活动家、中国国民党革命委员会的创始人之一。他的一生经历了我国近代史上许多重大的变革，在几十年的政治风云中，不断探索，不断进步，走过了从爱国主义到社会主义的道路，他为民主革命和社会主义所作的贡献，是值得我们永远纪念的。
  陈铭枢同志字真如，广东合浦人。少年时代即关心国事，立志救国，17岁考入广东黄埔陆军小学。在校接受孙中山先生的革命思想，加入了同盟会。三年后与蒋光鼐同志一起转赴南京陆军中学，积极开展革命活动，成为该校同盟会对外联络负责人。他只身赴香港与有关方面联络，要求参加广州黄花岗起义，因故未达目的，但在同学中起了积极的影响。辛亥革命爆发后，他动员一批同学赴武昌参加了武昌保卫战。之后进入保定军校，因参加讨袁斗争，被通缉。
    1915年陈铭枢同志在广州策划暗杀广东督军龙济光，事泄被捕入狱，在同志的营救下越狱逃往日本。1920年他出任粤军第一师第四团团长，当时邓演达先生为该师直属工兵营长，两人志同道合，交谊很深，并于1922年春一道参加了孙中山先生领导的第一次北伐。同年夏，陈炯明叛变，陈铭枢同志闻讯回救，途中部队被瓦解。他不甘附逆，辞去团长职务，改名真如，前往南京。
    1923年初，经邓演达先生说服，陈铭枢同志重回粤军第一师李济深部担任第一旅旅长，受到李济深同志的器重。1924年初，他拥护孙中山先生改组国民党，实行“联俄、联共、扶助农工”三大政策，实现国共第一次合作的决策。1925年，他率部参加讨伐陈炯明的第一次东征，以战功卓著升任第四军第十师师长，接着参加了第二次东征和南征邓本殷的战斗，一直打到海南岛。
    1926年夏，北伐战争开始，陈铭枢同志所在的第四军以共产党人叶挺同志领导的独立团为前锋，由粤入湘，直下两湖，击败吴佩孚主力，特别是在汀泗桥等著名战役中，他与叶挺同志、张发奎将军并肩作战，屡建战功，第四军因而被誉为“铁军”。攻克武汉后，陈铭枢同志任武汉警备司令、总政治部训练部长，后第十师扩编为第十一军，任军长。陈铭枢同志这段与共产党人同生死、共命运的历史，对他以后的思想发展具有深远影响。
    “九·一八”日本帝国主义侵占我东北，中华民族面临生死存亡的危急关头，陈铭枢同志当时任京沪卫戍总司令，他同驻沪的十九路军蔡廷锴、蒋光鼐、戴戟等将领主张抗日，反对国民党政府的不抵抗政策。1932年初，日军对上海发动侵略，十九路军奋起抵抗，开始了震撼世界的“一·二八”淞沪抗战。这一战役，历时一个多月，十九路军的英勇作战，日军伤亡惨重，被迫数易指挥官，沉重地打击了侵略者的气焰。上海各界人民自动组织起来，“有钱出钱，有力出力”，支援前线，军民一心，同仇敌忾，为保卫大上海作出了重大贡献。这一战役鼓舞了全国人民的斗志，推动了全国规模的抗日高潮，获得了全世界进步力量舆论的赞扬。
    由于国民党政府坚持“攘外必先安内”的反动方针，陈铭枢同志被迫辞职，十九路军也被调赴福建地区“剿共”，这就引起了该军广大官兵的强烈不满。1933年1月，在陈铭枢等同志的支持下，十九路军同中央红军签订了停战协定，之后又缔结了联合反蒋抗日的军事协定，从此同共产党建立了合作关系。
    1933年11月，陈铭枢、谭平山、梅龚彬等同志与十九路军将领蔡廷锴、蒋光鼐一道，并联合李济深、冯玉祥、陈友仁、李章达以及第三党的黄琪翔、章伯钧等人发动福建事变，成立中华共和国人民革命政府，选举李济深同志为主席，发表宣言，号召“打倒以南京政府为中心的国民党”。根据协定共产党派潘汉年、张云逸同志从瑞金到福州。张为军事代表，潘为政治代表。陈铭枢同志是这次事变的领导核心成员之一，担任人民政府委员兼文化委员会主任和经济委员会主任，在福建事变中起到了重要作用，正式宣告在组织上脱离蒋介石集团。这次事变虽然失败了，但是它标志着国民党内部围绕着抗日还是反共这个问题，矛盾进一步激化，国民党内的爱国民主力量进一步集结，并发展到同国民党反动统治集团采取公开的对抗，这是有进步意义的。
    福建事变后，陈铭枢同志避居香港，组织了社会民主党。1935年，社会民主党改组为中华民族革命同盟，积极响应共产党发出的团结御侮主张和《八一宣言》的主张。
    抗日战争时期，陈担任军事委员会参议，中国国民外交协会和世界反侵略大会中国分会的领导人，他赞同国共合作，团结抗日，坚决反对消极抗日、积极反共的反动行径，并支持和参加当时的抗日民主运动。他还不断向国际上揭露日军侵略暴行，呼吁世界各国支援中国抗日。
    1943年2月，在中共南方局的支持下，陈铭枢同志与谭平山、柳亚子、王昆仑、杨杰、郭春涛、朱蕴山等在重庆发起组织三民主义同志联合会（简称民联），以座谈时事的形式，联系和团结国民党爱国民主人士，迎接抗日战争的最后胜利。1945年《双十协定》签订后，民联在重庆举行第一次全体会议，宣告正式成立，陈当选为常务理事。在旧政治协商会议期间，民联做了不少有益的工作，对团结国民党爱国民主力量反对内战，争取和平，发挥了积极作用。
    1947年11月，陈铭枢同志应李济深、何香凝同志邀请，赴港参加筹建中国国民党革命委员会。1948年1月1日民革在香港成立，宋庆龄当选名誉主席，李济深当选主席，陈当选为中央执行委员。民革一成立，即打出联共反蒋旗帜，同蒋介石的独裁统治进行斗争。陈铭枢同志受民革指派回到上海，进行联络工作，策动起义，为配合中国人民解放军南下，瓦解国民党军政方面的力量，做了不懈的努力。
    1949年9月，陈作为民联代表出席第一届中国人民政治协商会议。他在会上发言说，“我们愿意继承孙中山先生的革命传统，与各民主党派在中国共产党的领导下，从事新中国的建设。”陈铭枢同志与其他国民党爱国民主人士一样，遵循孙中山先生的三大政策为指导，与中共长期合作，并在合作中接受中国共产党的领导和坚持社会主义的方向，在历史转折的重大时刻，作出了正确的抉择。
    新中国成立后，陈铭枢同志历任中央人民政府委员、中南军政委员会副主席、全国人大常委、全国政协常委、民革中央常委。他积极参加社会主义革命和建设，关心祖国统一大业，并对政府工作提出了不少中肯的批评和有益的建议。即使在他一度受到委屈，身处逆境的时候，仍就国内外大事，坦率地陈述己见，体现了同共产党坦诚相见的精神。
    陈铭枢同志的一生是爱国的一生，不断进步的一生。他为人公正坦率，刻苦好学，举凡哲学、军事、政治、文化以至佛学等方面，都广为涉猎，有较深的造诣。他交游广阔，生前友好遍及海内外，他长期活跃在中国的军事、政治方面，在国民党军政人员中很有影响。
    陈铭枢同志为人民群众反帝反封建的斗争和新中国的建设事业，奉献了毕生的精力。他深切体会
  “只有社会主义才能救中国”，渴望祖国早日统一。我们纪念陈铭枢同志诞辰一百周年，应学习他坚强的爱国精神，为振兴中华、统一祖国而努力奋斗。
