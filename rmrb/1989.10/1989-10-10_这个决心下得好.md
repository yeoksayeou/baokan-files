Recently, there have been 7 counties (cities) in the Fuyang area of Anhui Province where incidents of producing and selling counterfeit and substandard drugs have occurred, involving thousands of people in illegal activities. Last year alone, 184 major cases were investigated, and 7.45 million counterfeit and substandard drug tablets and 1.12 million injections were seized.

Recently, the Fuyang Regional Committee and the Regional Government have decided to rectify the pharmaceutical market, implementing a system of administrative chief responsibility at all levels. The Regional Governor, Wang Wenbin, announced: "If the pharmaceutical market in the entire region is not rectified, I will take responsibility; if there are cases of producing and selling counterfeit and substandard drugs in any county, district, or township, the county magistrate, district chief, or township chief will be held accountable."

This decision is well made!

The disorder in the circulation of pharmaceuticals, the prevalence of counterfeit and substandard drugs in the market, and the threat to the safety and health of the people's medication, all require vigorous rectification and management. In the past, the disorder in pharmaceutical circulation in many places was mainly due to the lax management of the responsible departments, lack of accountability, and inadequate control over the issuance of "three certificates" (_Qualification Certificate_, _Permit_, _Business License_) to drug trading units, leading to multiple entities engaging in drug trading. Taking Fuyang as an example, in recent years, more than 1,800 collective and individual drug trading stores have emerged. In Fuyang City, there are more than 300 stores engaged in drug wholesale on two streets. Among them, some operate without a license, some lack the "three certificates," and others arbitrarily expand their business scope. In some places, the illegal activities in drug trading are not strictly investigated and punished. This is why some lawbreakers have found loopholes to exploit; some people, with impunity, engage in illegal activities, leading to frequent and increasingly malicious cases of producing and selling counterfeit and substandard drugs.

The chaos in the pharmaceutical market directly affects the health and safety of the people's lives and should be of concern to governments and relevant departments at all levels, who should take strict measures to rectify it. Administrative chiefs at all levels should take responsibility because, first, maintaining a good order in the pharmaceutical market and ensuring the safety and health of the people's medication is one of their duties; second, administrative chiefs taking responsibility is conducive to departmental coordination and comprehensive management, changing the situation of mutual buck-passing and evasion. With local administrative chiefs taking the lead, coordinating the public security, industry and commerce, taxation, health, and pharmaceutical departments of the government, each department can perform its duties while working together, which is beneficial for cracking down on various illegal and disciplinary activities.

Of course, having the resolve is just the beginning; the key is implementation. Now, Fuyang has taken action and it is hoped that they will persist and achieve results. This will serve as a reference for other places with similar problems.

    这个决心下得好
    江溪
    安徽阜阳地区，近年有7个县（市）发生过制售假劣药事件，上千人参与违法活动。仅去年查处的较大案件就有184起，收缴各种假药劣药片剂745万片、针剂112万支。
    最近，阜阳地委、行署下决心整顿医药市场，层层实行行政首长负责制。行署专员汪文斌宣布：“如果全地区医药市场整顿不好，由我负责；哪个县、哪个区、哪个乡出现制售假劣药案件，唯县长、区长、乡长是问。”
    这个决心下得好！
    医药流通秩序混乱，假劣药充斥市场，危及人民用药安全和健康，对此应当大力进行治理、整顿。过去不少地方医药流通中出现的无序现象，主要在于主管部门放松管理，无人负责，如对药品经营单位发放“三证”（《合格证》、《许可证》、《营业执照》）把关不严，以至多头插手经营药品。以阜阳为例，这几年就冒出1800多家集体、个体药品经销店，阜阳城内两条街上，有300多家搞药品批发。其中，有的是无照经营，有的“三证”不全，有的则擅自扩大经营范围。有一些地方，对药品经营的违法行为，查处不严，打击不力。正因为如此，一些不法之徒就有空子可钻；有的人有恃无恐，大搞非法活动，致使制售假劣药等案件屡禁不止，手段也更加恶劣。
    医药市场的混乱，直接影响到人民的健康和生命的安全，应该引起各级政府和主管部门的重视，严加整顿。各级行政首长都要负起责任来，因为其一，维护医药市场良好秩序，保障人民用药安全和健康是自己的职责之一；其二，行政首长负责有利于部门协调、综合治理，改变互相推诿、扯皮的状况。由地方行政首长牵头，协调公安、工商、税务、卫生、医药等政府有关部门，既各司其职，又通力合作，有利于打击各种违法违纪活动。
    当然，有决心只是前提，关键是落实。现在，阜阳已经行动起来，希望坚持下去，取得成效。这对于别的存在类似问题的地方，是一个借鉴。
