Wang Zhen, Vice President of China, met with Comorian guests this morning in the Great Hall of the People. He said, "China has always advocated that countries, regardless of their size, should be treated equally in international affairs and mutual exchanges."

The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros is an Indian Ocean island nation with an area of over 2,000 square kilometers and a population of 440,000. Wang Zhen, in his meeting with the first deputy speaker of the Federal Assembly, Abdulla Amhed Nassuf, and the third deputy speaker, Said Bakar, said that China is willing to maintain friendly relations with all countries and develop friendly relations with them on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said that the Chinese people still remember President Abdulla's visit to China last year. He believed that the visit of the two deputy speakers to participate in the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China would further promote friendly cooperation between the two countries.

Nassuf, the first deputy speaker, said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have been deeply ingrained in people's hearts. China not only advocates but also practices these five principles. He said that China has always treated Comoros "equally," and the warm reception they received during their participation in the National Day activities of the People's Republic of China clearly shows that there is a very friendly relationship between the two countries. He hoped that the exchanges between the two countries and the friendship between the two peoples would continue to develop.

Nassuf thanked Wang Zhen for meeting with them before their departure from China and conveyed his father, President Abdulla's, good wishes to Chairman Yang Shangkun and Vice President Wang Zhen. Wang Zhen said, "Chairman Yang Shangkun and I wish President Abdulla all the best."

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Re Jiequn, was present at the meeting.

    王震会见科摩罗客人
    新华社北京10月2日电（记者周慈朴）国家副主席王震今天上午在人民大会堂会见科摩罗客人时说：“中国历来主张国家不分大小，在国际事务和相互交往中要一律平等。”
    科摩罗联邦共和国是一个印度洋岛国，面积为2000多平方公里，人口仅44万。王震在会见来自这个国家的联邦议会第一副议长阿卜杜拉·阿迈德·纳索夫和第三副议长赛义德
  ·巴卡尔时说，中国愿意同世界各国友好相处，在和平共处五项原则的基础上同它们发展友好关系。他说，中国人民还记得科摩罗总统阿卜杜拉去年对中国的访问。他相信，这次两位副议长来访，参加中华人民共和国成立40周年的庆典，必将进一步增进中科两国的友好合作关系。
    纳索夫第一副议长说，和平共处五项原则已经深入人心。中国不仅倡导而且以自己的行动实践了这五项原则。他说，中国一直对科摩罗“平等相待”，他们这次在参加中华人民共和国国庆活动中所受到的热情接待就清楚地表明，科中两国存在着十分友好的关系。他希望两国的交往和两国人民之间的友谊继续发展下去。
    纳索夫感谢王震在他们离开中国之前会见他们，并转达了他的父亲、科摩罗总统对杨尚昆主席和王震副主席的良好问候。王震说：“杨尚昆主席和我本人祝愿阿卜杜拉总统万事如意。”
    会见时，全国人大常委会副委员长雷洁琼在座。
