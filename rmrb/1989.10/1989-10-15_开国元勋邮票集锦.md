The first set of Mao Zedong portrait stamps was issued in March 1944 in the Shandong liberation area. The design features Mao Zedong's front-facing portrait with a border of rice stalks on the left side. The set consists of three stamps: 5 fen blue, 1 jiao green, and 5 jiao brown. These were printed by the Shandong wartime postal service. Mao Zedong's portrait stamps were instantly beloved by the people. After liberation, many Mao Zedong portrait stamps were issued, all in color. The most distinctive is the one featuring Mao wearing an eight-cornered cap. This stamp was printed based on a photograph taken by American journalist Edgar Snow. It is said that Mao did not usually wear a cap, but Snow placed his own military cap on Mao's head, capturing this historically significant image.

On October 1, 1959, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued a commemorative stamp for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation, depicting the grand scene of the founding ceremony. On the evening of October 1, after watching fireworks at Tiananmen Square, Mao Zedong returned to Zhongnanhai's Hall of Purity and Tranquility. Postal worker and stamp collector Yang Shaoming presented this stamp to him, asking for his autograph. Mao Zedong agreed and asked, "Where should I sign?" "Please sign on the stamp," Shaoming replied. Mao Zedong smiled and said, "Won't that damage the stamp?" Shaoming said, "It doesn't matter, that's what makes it meaningful!" Mao Zedong then wrote "Mao Zedong" and added the date.

The first set of Zhu De portrait stamps was issued in August 1945 by the Shandong wartime postal service. The design features Marshal Zhu on the right side and the people's army holding up the revolutionary flag on the left. This was the first set of commemorative stamps issued by the people's postal service for the August 1st Army Day. After the founding of the nation, Zhu De's image appeared on stamps commemorating the Nanchang Uprising and the meeting at Jinggangshan. Stamp collector Luo Huasheng still treasures a stamp titled "Seizing Luding Bridge," which features Marshal Zhu's personal autograph.

The image of Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the Republic, beloved by all ethnic groups in the nation, appears so grand on the stamps: He is seen reading the grand blueprint for building a modernized nation at the National People's Congress. He is warmly shaking hands with the "Iron Man" of the petroleum front, Wang Jinxi. He is smiling benevolently among the peasant representatives.

The commemorative stamps featuring the image of the founding hero Liu Shaoqi deeply express the endless remembrance of the billion people for the Chairman of the Republic. Similarly, stamps featuring the images of Marshals Ye Jianying, Peng Dehuai, and He Long evoke people's nostalgia and remembrance.

    开国元勋邮票集锦
    首套毛泽东的肖像邮票，是1944年3月在山东解放区发行的。图案为毛泽东正面像，左侧为稻禾边框，全套三枚：5分蓝色、1角绿色、5角褐色。它由山东战时邮局印制。毛泽东像邮票一出现，就受到人民群众的喜爱。解放后，毛泽东肖像的邮票不少，都是彩色印刷。最有特色的是头戴八角帽的那枚邮票。它是根据美国记者斯诺所摄的照片印刷的。据说毛泽东平日不爱戴帽，当时斯诺把自己的军帽戴在他头上，才留下了这幅具有历史意义的作品。　　　1959年10月1日，邮电部发行了国庆10周年的纪念邮票，画面是开国盛典的伟大场面。“十·一”晚上，毛泽东在天安门看完焰火回到中南海勤政殿。工作人员、集邮爱好者杨绍明拿着这枚邮票请他签名留念。毛泽东边答应边问道：“签在哪里？”“请签在邮票上。”毛泽东笑着说：“那不把邮票弄坏了？”绍明说：“没关系，这才有意义哩！”毛泽东欣然写下“毛泽东”三个字，还注上了日期。
    朱德像的邮票发行也比较早。1945年8月，由山东战时邮政总局发行的，图案右边为朱总司令像，左边为人民军队高举革命大旗的邮票，是人民邮政发行的第一套纪念“八·一”建军节的邮票。建国以后，在纪念南昌起义、井冈山会师的邮票上，都有着朱老总的形象。集邮爱好者罗华生至今仍珍藏着一枚《强夺泸定桥》的邮票，那上面有着朱总司令的亲笔签名。
    深受全国各族人民爱戴的共和国第一任总理周恩来的形象，在邮票上显得是那么地高大：他在人大会议上宣读为全国人民描绘的建设四个现代化的宏伟蓝图。他亲切地和石油战线上的铁人王进喜握手，他在农民代表当中慈祥地微笑着。
    那有着开国元勋刘少奇形象的纪念邮票，深深地表达了亿万人民群众对共和国主席的无尽怀念。还有叶剑英、彭德怀、贺龙元帅形象的纪念邮票，都同样引起人们的追思怀念。
