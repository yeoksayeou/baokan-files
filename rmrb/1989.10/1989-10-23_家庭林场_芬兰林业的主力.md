Finland's abundant forest resources are well-known worldwide. We were curious to learn about their unique approach to forest management. Accompanied by Karl, a representative from the Forestry Association, we visited a family forest located approximately 160 kilometers northwest of Helsinki. Karl explained, "Finland has 350,000 family forests, which account for two-thirds of the country's forest area. Eighty percent of Finland's timber industry's raw materials come from these family forests."

The forest owner, Malmstrom, introduced himself, stating that his ancestors had moved here from Sweden many generations ago, and he is the seventeenth generation to manage this forest. The forest covers 230 hectares, with an additional 52 hectares of farmland and 122 hectares of undeveloped land. Moreover, the forest also raises over 400 pigs. Most of the work is done by the forest owner and his family, with additional labor hired during the logging and farming seasons.

The owner drove us into the forest for a tour. The forest is primarily composed of towering European red pines, umbrella-shaped spruces, and some birch and poplar trees. The owner explained that the forest's average annual harvest is 5.7 cubic meters per hectare, and the annual sales of logs can reach over 80,000 marks. When discussing forest management, he pointed to the trees and said, "Although these trees belong to me, I cannot harvest them arbitrarily. I must apply to the Forestry Association for approval."

Finland has established a comprehensive system from the central to the local level to guide the activities of family forests, ensuring scientific management and protection of forest resources. There are 19 regional forestry associations and 377 forestry cooperatives nationwide. Each forestry cooperative consists of about 900 family forests, with most of the operational funds coming from the forests themselves. The leaders are elected by the members. Karl is the representative of the forestry cooperative to which this farm belongs. He received his forestry education at a university and is very familiar with the local situation. He mentioned that the primary task of the forestry cooperative is to provide technical guidance for the forests, from seedling cultivation, forestry, logging, to pest control and fire prevention, improving management to achieve the greatest production benefits. The owner showed us a chart, which is the harvesting plan made by the forestry cooperative's technician, clearly indicating when, where, and how much to harvest. According to Finnish forestry law, the harvesting amount must be strictly controlled. The allowable harvesting amount calculated by the technicians is lower than the forest growth rate. To maintain a certain amount of reserve resources, the actual harvesting amount is lower than the allowable amount. Each family forest's annual harvesting plan, made by the technician, must be reviewed and approved by the regional forestry association. While making the harvesting plan, the technician also makes a replanting plan. The forest must accept the technician's supervision and guidance during harvesting and replanting. If the forest owner does not follow the plan, they will be subject to legal penalties. In fact, the vast majority of forests strictly follow the plan.

We visited the forest's 3-hectare seedling nursery, where the young pine seedlings were growing well. The owner introduced that these tree species are high-quality varieties provided free of charge by the state. The forestry cooperative guides them in artificial afforestation and direct seeding, continuously renewing the forest. This forest has planted nearly 500,000 trees in over 40 years.

Malmstrom mentioned that the forestry cooperative, to help them better utilize the forest's production benefits, also promotes agricultural management methods, implements periodic harvesting, and creates a better growth environment for the trees. Since adopting this scientific forestry method, the forest's timber growth has significantly increased. The forestry cooperative's technicians also guide the forest in pest control and establish various measures to prevent forest fires. During the winter off-season, the forestry cooperative, at the request of the forest owners, collaborates with nearby agricultural colleges to hold technical training classes. Additionally, they organize lectures, exhibitions, and experience-sharing sessions to continuously improve the forest owners' technical and management levels. The forestry cooperative also handles negotiations with timber companies on behalf of the forest owners, ensuring the interests of the forests.

The Finnish government provides economic assistance to family forests annually, with part of it given free of charge through the forestry cooperative and the other part provided as long-term low-interest loans to the forests, encouraging forest owners to increase investment in forestry. Malmstrom told us that he borrowed 650,000 marks from the state bank, which he repaid over 12 years with very low-interest rates. When the state levies forest product taxes on private forests, if the forest is well-managed and the timber production has significantly increased, taxes can be reduced or even waived, thereby motivating the forest owners.

Visiting Malmstrom's forest allowed us to see that while a suitable climate is a favorable condition for Finland's abundant forest resources, it is scientific management that is the main reason for the continuous increase in Finland's forest stock and growth.

### 家庭林场——芬兰林业的主力

　　家庭林场——芬兰林业的主力
　　本报记者　顾耀铭
    芬兰丰富的森林资源早已著称于世，我们很想知道它在森林经营方面的独到之处。在营林协会负责人卡尔的陪同下，我们参观了赫尔辛基西北部约160公里处的一个家庭林场。卡尔说：“芬兰共有35万个家庭林场，占全国森林面积的2／3。芬兰木材工业的原料80％来自家庭林场。”
    林场主马尔姆斯隆自我介绍，他的祖先早年从瑞典来到这里，他是这里的第十七代林场主。这个林场规模不小，230公顷的森林，还有52公顷的农田和122公顷待开发的荒山。此外，林场还养了400多头猪。大部分活计由林场主老两口和儿子承担，到伐树和农忙季节再雇佣一些劳力。
    主人驾车带我们进山参观。这里生长的大多是参天的欧洲赤松、伞状的云杉，还有一些桦树和杨树。主人介绍说，林场年平均采伐量是每公顷5.7立方米，每年出售的圆木可达8万多马克。当谈到林场管理时，他指着树林说：“这些树虽然是属于我的，但是我不能随意采伐，必须向营林协会申请得到批准。”
    芬兰从中央到地方建立了一整套机构，指导家庭林场的活动，以便科学地管理和保护森林资源。全国有19个地区林业会和377个营林协会组织。每个营林协会由900个左右的家庭林场组成，活动资金大部分来自各林场，领导成员由会员选举产生。卡尔就是这个农场所属营林协会的负责人。他在大学受过林业教育，对这里的情况了如指掌。他谈到，营林协会的主要任务是为林场提供从育苗、营林、伐木到治理虫害和防火等技术指导，改善经营管理，使林场能获得最大的生产效益。主人给我们看一张图表，这是营林协会的技术员为他制定的采伐计划，何时、何地、采伐量多少一目了然。根据芬兰森林法，要求林场严格掌握采伐量。技术员经过科学计算出来的允许采伐量都低于森林生长量。为了保持一定数量的后备资源，实际采伐量又低于允许采伐量。家庭林场每年的采伐计划由技术员制定后，必须经过地区林业会审核批准。在制定采伐计划的同时，技术员还制定再植计划。林场在采伐和再植树木时，要接受技术员的监督和指导。如果林场主不执行计划，要受到法律的处罚。事实上，绝大多数林场都能严格地执行计划。
    我们参观了林场3公顷苗圃地，绿嫩的松树苗长势很好。主人介绍，这些树种都是国家免费提供的优良品种。营林协会指导他们进行人工植苗造林和直播造林，使树林不断得到更新。这个林场在40多年内共种植了近50万棵树。
    马尔姆斯隆谈到，营林协会为了帮助他们更好地发挥林地的生产效益，还推广农业经营的方法，实行定期间伐，给树木创造更好的生长环境。林场自从采用这种科学的营林方法后，林木生长量明显增长。营林协会的技术员还指导林场防治松叶蜂，建立预防森林火灾的各种措施。在冬闲时，营林协会应林场主的要求同附近的农学院联合举办技术培训班，此外不定期地组织讲座、展览会、经验交流会等，使林场主的技术和管理水平不断提高。营林协会还负责替林场主出面同木材公司洽谈销售，使林场的利益得到保障。
    芬兰政府每年要给家庭林场提供经济资助，其中一部分是通过营林协会免费赠送，另一部分是向林场提供长期低息贷款，促使林场主增加林业投资。马尔姆斯隆告诉我们，他向国家银行共贷款65万马克，在12年内还清，利息很低。国家在向私人林场征收林产税时，如林场管理得好，产材量有明显的增长，可以减税，甚至免税，以此调动林场主的积极性。
    参观马尔姆斯隆的林场，使我们看到，适宜的气候固然是芬兰森林资源丰富的有利条件，然而，依靠科学的管理是芬兰森林蓄积量和生长量不断上升的主要原因。
