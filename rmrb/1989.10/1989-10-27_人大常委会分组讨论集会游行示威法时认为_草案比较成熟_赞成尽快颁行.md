The seventh session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress held a group discussion today. The members, while reviewing the draft of the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law, generally believed that the revised draft is quite mature and supported its further revision and prompt enactment.

Commissioner Zhang Shiming said that it is very necessary to formulate the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law. It is beneficial for our country to promote socialist democracy, maintain national stability and unity, help the government correct its shortcomings and mistakes, facilitate our country's diplomatic work, and handle internal contradictions among the people and mobilize the enthusiasm of the people. He believed that the revised draft, whether in terms of guiding ideology or specific provisions, is quite good and suits China's national conditions.

Commissioner Qu Tangliang said that the draft of the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law has been revised well, and she supports its review and passage at this meeting. This law not only embodies the Constitution's guarantee of citizens' rights to assemble, parade, and demonstrate in accordance with the law, which is good for promoting socialist democracy, but also stipulates that citizens must abide by the Constitution and laws, maintain social stability and public order, and not harm the interests of the state, society, or the legitimate freedoms and rights of other citizens. She believed that assemblies, parades, and demonstrations should be conducted peacefully, and no country allows the use of violence. At the same time, government officials should not participate in assemblies, parades, and demonstrations that oppose state laws and policies, which is the minimum standard that public servants should adhere to. The revised provisions on these points are very necessary for ensuring the smooth conduct of assemblies, parades, and demonstrations.

Commissioner Yao Guang said that the draft of the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law has good provisions for protecting citizens' rights. To protect citizens' rights, it is also necessary to restrict the illegal exercise of these rights. Restriction, to a certain extent, is also protection. Protection is conditional, not unconditional, and the two should not be opposed or separated. The construction of socialist democracy and legal system is a long-term process, and this law can be gradually improved in future practice. He suggested that this meeting review and pass this law.

Many commissioners believed during the discussion that after the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law is enacted and published, efforts should be made to strengthen the propaganda and education of this law. Commissioner Pan Ye said that after this law is passed, it should be widely publicized and educated throughout the country, especially in government agencies and schools. Why this law is formulated, its significance and content, should be known to all the people in the country, to improve the people's awareness of abiding by the law. Once the law is enacted and published, it must be strictly enforced. Only by ensuring that the law is followed and enforced strictly can the dignity of the law be maintained, and the political and social environment of stability and unity be maintained. After the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law is published, it is truly necessary to ensure that everyone works together to enforce it. Only in this way can this law truly play a role in protecting the democratic rights of the people.

Commissioner Hu Daiguang believed that the propaganda of the positive significance of this law should be mainly carried out from the following aspects: (1) This law implements the spirit of the Constitution, guarantees the citizens' rights stipulated in the Constitution, and is beneficial for the development of socialist democracy. (2) This law is beneficial for improving the work of the government, preventing bureaucratism, and promoting clean governance. (3) This law is beneficial for correctly handling internal contradictions among the people, channeling public opinions into the correct channels, and is also a special means to improve work and educate cadres and the masses. (4) This law is beneficial for our country's diplomatic work.

Commissioner Yuan Xuefen said that the draft of the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law has been improved after revision. Through assemblies, parades, and demonstrations, people's opinions and emotions can be expressed, which has a positive effect on promoting national spirit. The formulation of the Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration Law should stand the test of time, preventing the negative aspects of assemblies, parades, and demonstrations, and guaranteeing the positive aspects of the citizens' rights granted by the Constitution. Therefore, it is hoped that in the further revision, this dialectical view can be better reflected.

Many commissioners also proposed amendments to some specific provisions in the draft.

　　人大常委会分组讨论集会游行示威法时认为
　　草案比较成熟　赞成尽快颁行
    新华社北京10月26日电  七届全国人大常委会第十次会议今天举行分组讨论。委员们在审议集会游行示威法草案时普遍认为，修改后的草案比较成熟，赞成进一步修改后尽快颁布施行。
    章师明委员说，制定集会游行示威法很有必要，它有利于我国发扬社会主义民主，有利于维护我国的安定团结，有利于政府克服缺点纠正错误，有利于我国开展外交工作，有利于处理人民内部矛盾和调动人民群众的积极性。他认为，修改后的草案，无论是指导思想，还是具体条文，都比较好，符合我国国情。
    区棠亮委员说，集会游行示威法草案修改得较好，赞成本次会议审议通过。这个法既体现了宪法保障公民依法行使集会、游行、示威的权利，对发扬社会主义民主有好处；又规定了公民必须遵守宪法、法律，维护社会安定和公共秩序，不能损害国家、社会的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利。她认为，集会、游行、示威应当和平地举行，任何国家都不允许使用暴力。同时，国家机关工作人员不得参加反对国家法律、政策等的集会、游行、示威，这是公务人员起码应遵守的准则。修改后的这几条对保证集会、游行、示威的顺利进行很必要。
    姚广委员说，集会游行示威法草案对保障公民权利的各项规定很好。为了保障公民权利，也必须限制非法行使这种权利。限制，从一定意义上讲也是保障。保障，是有条件的，不是无条件的，二者又不能对立、割裂。社会主义民主与法制建设是一个长期过程，本法在今后实践中还可以逐步完善。建议本次会议审议通过这个法律。
    许多委员在讨论中认为，集会游行示威法通过公布后要加强对这个法律的宣传教育。潘焱委员说，本法通过后，要在全国范围尤其是机关和学校进行广泛的、大张旗鼓的宣传教育。为什么要制定此法，它有什么意义和内容，要使全国人民都知道它的重要性，提高人民遵守法律的自觉性。法律通过公布了，就一定要严格执行。只有有法必依，执法必严，才能维护法律的尊严，维护安定团结的政治局面和社会环境。集会游行示威法公布后要真正做到上下一心，共同执行。只有这样，才能使这个法真正起到保障人民民主权利的作用。
    胡代光委员认为，宣传本法的积极意义应主要从以下几方面进行：（1）本法贯彻了宪法精神，保障了宪法规定的公民权利，有利于发展社会主义民主。（2）本法有利于改进政府的工作，防止官僚主义，促进廉政建设。（3）本法有利于正确处理人民内部矛盾，把群众的意见纳入正确渠道，同时也是改进工作，教育干部和群众的一种特殊手段。（4）本法有利于我国开展外交工作。
    袁雪芬委员说，集会游行示威法草案经修改，有较大的改进。通过集会、游行、示威活动可以表达人们的意见和情绪，这对发扬民族精神具有积极作用。制定集会游行示威法要经得起时间考验，既要防止集会游行示威的消极方面，又要保障宪法赋予公民权利的积极方面。因此，希望在进一步的修改中更好地体现出这个辩证观点。
    许多委员还对草案中的一些具体条款提出了修改意见。
