The "Dacia" is a brand of small cars produced in Romania. Upon arriving in Romania, one of the most striking and deeply impressionable sights is the ubiquitous "Dacia" cars on the streets.

Whether it is a private car or a government vehicle, they are all "Dacia" brand. From the President of the Republic to the ordinary citizen, everyone drives a "Dacia." It almost seems that aside from the "Dacia," there are no other brands of cars in the country. Upon inquiry, it turns out to be true. Currently, 99% of the cars in the country are domestically produced "Dacia" brand cars; out of the 1.5 million private cars, almost all are "Dacia." In a humorous sense, if Romania were to be put on wheels, it would undoubtedly be the "Dacia." The "Dacia" has truly become a part of the Romanian people's lives.

However, in the contemporary trend of small cars, the "Dacia" is only considered an ordinary, mass-produced car. I once asked a colleague from the "Spark" newspaper, "Why not import some cars?" The response was, "'Dacia' is even exported to many countries!" It is understood that Romania exports tens of thousands of "Dacia" cars annually, not only to socialist countries but also to some developed Western countries. Why is the "Dacia" so beloved by the Romanian people? Later, after we learned about the overall development of Romania's transportation industry, we understood that the "Dacia" is not just a part of the Romanian people's lives but also a vivid embodiment of the Romanian people's spirit of self-reliance and frugal nation-building.

Romania's small car industry developed and grew through the introduction of technology. The production technology of the "Dacia" brand cars was initially introduced from the French Renault automobile factory. After digestion and absorption, it was eventually turned into their own technology.

Today's "Dacia" brand cars are completely Romanian products. The Romanians named it "Dacia," which has a profound meaning. The ancestors of the Romanian people were the Dacians, who established their own Dacian state in 70 BC and created a glorious ancient Romanian civilization. Today's "Dacia" represents the Romanian people's unyielding spirit of self-strengthening, symbolizing the Romanian people's noble pursuit of self-respect and self-love. To be precise, the entire Romanian automobile industry is built on the foundation of self-reliance.

Currently, all types of vehicles needed for production and life in Romania, such as buses, trucks, and off-road vehicles, are basically domestically produced. Therefore, facing the independent and powerful automobile industry in their own country, how could the Romanian people not be proud of owning their beloved "Dacia" cars!

In developing its own transportation industry, Romania has always adhered to the principle of frugal nation-building. The cars it produces are all fuel-efficient. For example, the "Dacia" small car is characterized by fuel efficiency and compactness, all of which are derived from the national condition of saving limited energy. The cars produced in Romania do not have air conditioning, not because they cannot be produced technologically or are not needed, but mainly because of considerations of frugality and thrift, not pursuing luxurious and extravagant consumption, and not engaging in comparisons beyond national strength. In addition to striving for precision and frugality in new products and new technologies, Romania has also tried to preserve some transportation tools that are considered outdated by general standards but are economical, practical, and convenient, such as trams and public buses with two large gas cylinders installed on the roof. These can be seen everywhere, even in the bustling city of Bucharest.

Furthermore, Romania's experience in building its own subway is even more convincing. The history of Romania's subway construction began in the 1970s of this century, when there were already 118 subway systems in the world. Should it be imported or built independently? The Romanian Communist Party Central Committee made a decisive decision: foreign technology can be referenced, but it must be done with our own strength! After investigating 15 subway systems abroad, many experts and engineering technicians independently designed a subway system suitable for the national conditions and, relying on their own strength, established the Bucharest subway system. From the completion of the first 8-kilometer subway line in 1975 to the completion of the fifth 10.4-kilometer subway line this August, a total of 60 kilometers of double-line, 38-station subway system has been built, completing the task proposed by the 13th Party Congress one year ahead of schedule.

When we visited the Bucharest subway, we found that from the subway's command system to the entire tunnel engineering, contemporary relatively advanced technology and equipment were used. However, in the design and manufacturing of the locomotives and carriages, the principle of thrift and practicality was evident throughout. The carriage capacity is larger than that of other countries, carrying more passengers; the interior equipment is exquisite but not luxurious; the station construction is magnificent but not extravagant, making one involuntarily associate it with the "Dacia" brand car. In them, there seems to be a common element, that is, the "Dacia" spirit that the Romanian people have endowed them with.

### “达契亚”精神

    “达契亚”精神
    本报记者  曾坤
    “达契亚”是罗马尼亚国产的一种小轿车牌号。来到罗马尼亚，令人触目、给人最深的印象之一，莫过于那满街奔跑的“达契亚”。
    不管是私人小车，还是公家的小车，全是“达契亚”牌，不论是共和国总统，还是普通老百姓，都乘坐的是“达契亚”。简直让人觉得，全国的小轿车除“达契亚”以外，似乎再无别的牌子的车。后来一打听，果然如此。现在全国拥有的小轿车中，99％是国产的“达契亚”；全国150万辆私人小车中，几乎是清一色的“达契亚”。风趣一点说，把罗马尼亚装上轮子的，非“达契亚”莫属。“达契亚”真正成了罗马尼亚人生活的一部分。
    可是，在当代小轿车的潮流中，“达契亚”不论其档次及现代化程度，都只能归入普通型大众化车的行列。我曾问陪同我们的《火花报》同志：
  “为什么不进口一些小轿车？”答曰：“‘达契亚’还向许多国家出口呢！”据了解，每年罗马尼亚出口的“达契亚”上万辆，不但向社会主义国家出口，还向西方一些发达国家出口。“达契亚”为何受到罗马尼亚人民如此青睐呢？后来，当我们了解了罗马尼亚整个运输工业发展概况后，我们才明白，“达契亚”不仅仅是罗马尼亚人生活的一部分，而且是罗马尼亚人民自力更生、勤俭建国精神的生动写照。
    罗马尼亚小轿车工业，是靠引进技术发展壮大起来的。“达契亚”牌小汽车的生产技术，最早是从法国雷诺汽车厂引进的。经过消化、吸收，最后完全变为自己的技术。
    今日的“达契亚”牌小汽车，已经是彻头彻尾的罗马尼亚产品。罗马尼亚人将它起名为“达契亚”，其寓意是深刻的。罗马尼亚人的远祖是达契亚人，他们在公元前70年建立了自己的达契亚国，并创造了辉煌的罗马尼亚古代文明。今天的“达契亚”代表了罗马尼亚民族自强不息的奋斗精神，象征着罗马尼亚民族自尊自爱的高尚追求。确切地说，罗马尼亚整个汽车工业都是建立在自力更生的基础上的。
    目前，罗马尼亚全国生产、生活所需的各种类型的车辆，如公共汽车、卡车、越野车等，基本上都是国产货。所以，面对本国独立、强大的汽车工业，罗马尼亚人怎能不为拥有心爱的“达契亚”车而骄傲呢！
    罗马尼亚在发展自己的运输工业时，始终坚持勤俭建国的方针，所生产的汽车都属节油型的。像“达契亚”小轿车，其特点就是省油、小巧，这些都是从节约有限的能源这一国情出发。罗马尼亚生产的汽车均无空调装置，绝不是在技术上生产不出来，也不是不需要，而主要是从勤俭节约考虑，不追求豪华奢侈的消费，更不作超出国力的攀比。罗马尼亚除了在新产品、新技术方面刻意求精、求俭外，还尽可能保存了一些现在一般人看来觉得过时，但却省钱、实用、方便的交通工具，如有轨电车、车顶棚安装有两个大煤气罐的公共汽车。这些即使在繁华的布加勒斯特市也随处可见。
    另外，罗马尼亚建设自己地铁的经历，更具说服力。罗马尼亚建设地铁的历史，始于本世纪70年代，当时世界上已有118个地铁系统。是引进，还是自建？罗共中央一锤定音：外国技术可借鉴，但要靠自己的力量来搞！许多专家、工程技术人员在考察了国外15个地铁系统的基础上，独立设计出符合本国国情的地铁系统，依靠自己的力量建立起布加勒斯特的地铁系统。从1975年第一道8公里地铁建成通车，到今年8月第五道10.4公里地铁建成，共建成60公里长、双线、38个车站的地铁系统，提前一年完成党的十三大提出的任务。
    我们参观布加勒斯特地铁时发现，从地铁的指挥系统到整个隧道工程，完全采用的是当代较先进的技术设备。然而在机车、车厢的设计制造上，却处处体现出节俭实用的原则。车厢容积比其它国家的要大，载客多；车厢内设备精致但不豪华；车站建设壮观但不奢侈，使人不由自主地联想到“达契亚”牌小汽车，在它们身上，似乎有一个共同的东西，那就是罗马尼亚人赋予它们的“达契亚”精神。
