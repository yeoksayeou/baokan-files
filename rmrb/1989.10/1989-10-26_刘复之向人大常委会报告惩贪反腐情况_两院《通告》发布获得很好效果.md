Liu Fuzi, the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said today that since the issuance of the joint notice by the two courts, it has been proven that our implementation of this temporary major policy fully reflects the Party and the state's resolve to severely punish corruption, bribery, and other corrupt practices, and the policy of leniency for those who confess. This has effectively deterred criminals, prompting a large number of criminals to confess and surrender, and has saved a large number of people who were on the path to committing crimes of embezzlement and bribery. It has also exposed a large number of hidden and cunning criminals. It has enhanced the legal awareness of cadres and the masses, boosted confidence in the fight against corruption, and increased the enthusiasm and initiative of cadres and the masses to combat crimes such as embezzlement and bribery.

Liu Fuzi said that from the perspective of the past two months of confessions and surrenders, good legal and social effects have already been achieved. According to statistics from the procuratorial system, from August 15 to October 20, a total of 18,030 criminals have surrendered to the procuratorial organs. Among them, there are 401 county-level and division-level cadres and 14 bureau-level cadres. Of the surrenders, 3,963 people confessed to crimes involving amounts of 100,000 yuan or more. Among these, 3,299 people confessed to amounts between 100,000 yuan and 500,000 yuan, 372 people confessed to amounts between 500,000 yuan and 1 million yuan, 236 people confessed to amounts between 1 million yuan and 5 million yuan, 12 people confessed to amounts between 5 million yuan and 10 million yuan, and 6 people confessed to amounts exceeding 10 million yuan. The total amount of money involved in the confessions is 182.05 million yuan, and the amount of recovered illicit money and goods is 101.97 million yuan. In addition, among the criminals who have been subjected to compulsory measures by the procuratorial organs and are currently under investigation for embezzlement and bribery, 2,828 people have confessed to their crimes. During this period, the number of tips received by the procuratorial organs from the masses about embezzlement and bribery cases has also increased significantly. The number of cases handled by the procuratorial organs nationwide in August and September was 1.5 times higher than in June and July.

He said that during this period, the procuratorial organs have handled several notable features in the confessions and surrenders of criminals: (1) A relatively high proportion of major and important cases. According to statistics, among the criminals who surrendered, 25% were involved in major and important cases. (2) There are many cases of joint crimes and multiple people from the same unit committing crimes and then surrendering. According to statistics from some provincial and municipal procuratorial offices, about 40% of the surrenders involved joint crimes or multiple people from the same unit committing crimes. In many cases, one person's surrender led to several others surrendering. (3) There are many criminals at the grassroots level who have control over financial matters. Among the surrenders, more than 60% were managers, accountants, or procurement personnel in enterprises and institutions. (4) Most of the surrenders also returned the illicit money and goods. Those who have not yet fully returned the illicit money and goods have expressed their intention to do so as soon as possible. (5) Under the influence of the policy, a group of criminals who have been subjected to compulsory measures by the procuratorial organs for embezzlement and bribery have confessed to their crimes. (6) Many relatives of the criminals have acted rationally and persuaded or led the criminals to surrender. (7) Some embezzlement and bribery criminals have been deterred by the masses' reports and the procuratorial organs' investigations into key units and have surrendered.

Liu Fuzi said that currently, procuratorial organs at all levels are expediting the verification and investigation of the confessions and surrenders of criminals. For those who have been investigated and confirmed to have genuinely confessed and surrendered, the procuratorial organs are handling them leniently in accordance with the law or are prosecuting them and recommending to the people's courts to impose lighter or mitigated penalties. According to incomplete statistics from the procuratorial offices of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Hubei, Guangdong, and Sichuan, as of October 12, 972 criminals with relatively minor offenses or relatively serious offenses but with meritorious service have been decided not to be prosecuted. For 159 serious offenders who surrendered, prosecutions have been initiated, and recommendations have been made to the people's courts to impose lighter penalties. However, for those who refuse to confess and surrender or try to cover up their crimes, the procuratorial organs will decisively initiate investigations once discovered.

　　刘复之向人大常委会报告惩贪反腐情况
　　两院《通告》发布获得很好效果
    新华社北京10月25日电　最高人民检察院检察长刘复之今天说，两院《通告》发布以来的事实证明，我们实行这个临时大政策，充分体现了党和国家严厉惩治贪污、受贿等腐败现象的决心和坦白从宽的政策，有力地震慑了犯罪分子，促使一大批犯罪分子走自首坦白、认罪服法的道路；挽救了一大批正在贪污、贿赂犯罪邪路上下滑的人；发现了一大批隐蔽、狡猾的犯罪分子；增强了干部、群众的法制观念，提高了反腐败的信心和同贪污、贿赂等犯罪做斗争的积极性。
    刘复之说，从这两个多月自首、坦白的情况看，已经获得了很好的法制效果和社会效果。据检察系统统计，从8月15日至10月20日，全国已有18030名犯罪分子到检察机关投案自首。其中有县处级干部401人，司局级干部14人。自首人员交代犯罪金额在万元以上的有3963人，其中，10000元以上不满50000元的有3299人，50000元以上不满10万元的有372人，10万元以上不满50万元的有236人，50万元以上不满100万元的有12人，100万元以上的有6人。自首人员交代犯罪金额18205万元，退出赃款赃物计人民币10197万元。另外，被检察机关采取强制措施、正在侦查中的贪污、受贿等犯罪分子中，有2828名坦白交代了罪行。在这期间，广大群众向检察机关举报的贪污、受贿等犯罪线索也大幅度上升。8、9两个月全国检察机关受理的举报案件，比6、7两个月增加1.5倍。
    他说，在这段时间里，检察机关受理的犯罪分子自首、坦白有几个突出特点：（1）大、要案比例较大。据统计，在投案自首的犯罪分子中，大、要案犯占25％。（2）共同犯罪和同一单位数人作案后自首的多。据部分省、直辖市检察院统计，自首人员中共同犯罪和两人以上同属于一个单位作案的约占40％。不少是同案犯中或同一单位里一人自首带动几人自首的。（3）基层掌管财物实权的犯罪分子多。在投案自首人员中，有60％以上是企事业单位的厂长、经理、财会、采购人员。（4）大多数投案自首的都同时退清了赃款赃物，暂时没有全部退清的，也都表示要尽快退清。（5）在政策感召下，一批已被检察机关采取强制措施的贪污、受贿等犯罪分子坦白交代罪行。（6）许多犯罪分子的亲属深明大义，劝说、动员或带领犯罪分子投案自首。（7）一些贪污、受贿罪犯慑于群众举报和检察机关进驻重点单位查处案件的声势而投案自首。
    刘复之说，目前，各级检察院正在对自首、坦白的犯罪分子加紧进行查证、核实工作。对于已经侦查证实，确属自首、坦白的，检察机关正在依法作出从宽处理，或提起公诉并向人民法院建议依法从轻、减轻处罚。据北京、天津、上海、辽宁、江苏、浙江、福建、山东、湖北、广东、四川等11省、直辖市检察院的不完全统计，至10月12日，已对972名罪行较轻或罪行较重但有立功表现的自首、坦白的犯罪分子，作出免予起诉的决定，对159名罪行严重的投案自首犯罪分子提起公诉，建议人民法院依法从宽处罚。但是，对那些拒不自首、坦白或避重就轻、企图蒙混过关的犯罪分子，一经发现，检察机关坚决立案侦查。
