Since 1986, environmental protection workers in Zhangye City, Gansu Province, have established a blue-eared pheasant breeding center on the outskirts of the city. They have successfully bred 46 blue-eared pheasants. Look, the blue-eared pheasants that have just molted this year are full of vitality under the careful care of the breeding staff.

    蓝马鸡人工驯养繁殖成功
