	Vice Chairman Rong Yiren Emphasizes in Tokyo:
	China's Economic Development Cannot Do Without Reform and Opening Up

	New China News Agency, Tokyo, October 27 (Reporter: Rong Yiren) — Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, Rong Yiren, today emphasized that "China's economic development cannot do without reform and opening up."

	Rong Yiren made these remarks at the "15th Japan and ASEAN Business Leaders Conference" held in Tokyo.

	He pointed out that in the 40 years since the founding of New China, great achievements have been made in economic construction. Especially in the 10 years of reform and opening up, China's gross national product has increased by 1.5 times, with an average annual growth rate of 9.6%.

	When discussing the relationship between self-reliance and foreign economic and technological cooperation, Rong Yiren pointed out that in the process of developing the economy, any country must rely on its own efforts and cannot entrust its fate to other countries. However, this does not mean giving up on opening up to the outside world.

	He said that while China insists on self-reliance as the basis for economic development, it implements the policy of reform and opening up. This not only allows for the absorption of foreign technology, capital, and management experience to promote the development of the domestic economy, but also, through the provision of labor, resources, and markets, can have a positive impact on the development of the world economy.

	The two-day "15th Japan and ASEAN Business Leaders Conference" concluded today.

　　荣毅仁副委员长在东京强调
　　中国经济发展离不开改革开放
    新华社东京10月27日电  （记者冮冶）全国人大常务委员会副委员长、中国国际信托投资公司董事长荣毅仁今天强调指出，“中国的经济发展离不开改革开放”。
    荣毅仁是在此间举行的“第15届日本与东南亚国家联盟经营者会议”上讲演时说这番话的。
    他指出，新中国成立40年来，经济建设取得了巨大成就。特别是改革开放的10年，中国国民生产总值增长了1倍半，平均每年递增9.6％。
    荣毅仁在谈到自力更生与对外经济技术合作的关系时指出，任何国家在发展经济过程中都要依靠自己的努力，不能把国运寄托在其他国家身上，但这并不意味着放弃对外开放。
    他说，中国在坚持把自力更生作为发展经济基点的同时，实行改革开放政策，不仅可以吸取外国的技术、资金和经营管理经验，促进本国经济的发展，而且还可以通过提供劳动力、资源和市场等对世界经济的发展产生积极作用。
    为期两天的“第15届日本与东南亚国家联盟经营者会议”今天闭幕。
