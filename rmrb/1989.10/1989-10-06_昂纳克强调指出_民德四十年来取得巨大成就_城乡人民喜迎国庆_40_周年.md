Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 4th.

On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held a reception. Over 400 anti-fascist veterans, revolutionary veterans, and early activists were invited to the party's central headquarters to celebrate the occasion with party and state leaders. General Secretary Honecker, in his toast, said that the GDR has made significant strides in its socialist construction over the past 40 years, achieving unprecedented successes.

Honecker stated that those who are hostile to socialism cannot tolerate the existence of the GDR on German soil. Even now, there are people who believe they can eliminate the GDR through a comprehensive attack. This is sheer delusion.

Honecker refuted the arguments of a "German Empire continuing from the 1937 borders," "changing the status quo in Europe," and "exercising protective responsibilities over all Germans." He emphasized that the GDR opposes any attempt to alter the results of World War II and the subsequent developments.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 4th.

October 7th marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. On the eve of the holiday, the capital city of Berlin is bathed in autumn sunshine, with a pleasant atmosphere. The green lawns are covered with a layer of golden fallen leaves, and every household's balcony is adorned with pots of fresh flowers. The city's parks are blooming with vibrant colors. The markets are well-stocked, with vegetables, meats, fruits, and various food items filling the shelves. Department stores offer a wide array of goods, catering to every need. The people are immersed in the festive atmosphere, eagerly awaiting the celebration.

Over the past 40 years, both Berlin and the GDR have undergone tremendous changes. At the end of World War II, the entire city of Berlin was reduced to ruins, with 60% of its buildings turned into rubble.

In 1971, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany proposed the goal of "building a developed socialist society" and established the principle of "unifying economic policy and social welfare policy" for socialist construction, finding a path suitable for the country's specific circumstances.

Starting from 1971, the GDR's economy has developed steadily at an average annual growth rate of about 4%. Currently, it has become a developed socialist country with a comprehensive modern industry and agriculture. The national income, which signifies the country's economic strength, has increased from 29 billion marks at the time of its founding to over 260 billion marks in 1987. The per capita industrial output value has placed the GDR among the world's top ten industrial powers.

    昂纳克强调指出
    民德四十年来取得巨大成就
    城乡人民喜迎国庆40周年
    本报柏林10月4日电  记者许宏治报道：在民主德国成立40周年前夕，德国统一社会党中央政治局举行招待会，400多名反法西斯老战士、革命老战士和早期积极分子应邀来到党中央大厦，与党和国家领导人欢聚一堂，共庆佳节。总书记昂纳克同志在祝酒词中说，民德40年来在社会主义建设道路上前进了一大步，取得了历史上从未有过的成就。
    昂纳克说，那些敌视社会主义的人不能容忍在德国土地上成立民主德国。直到现在，还有人认为可以通过全面进攻消灭民主德国。这完全是痴心妄想。
    昂纳克驳斥了“1937年边界的德意志帝国继续存在”、“改变欧洲现状”、“对所有德国人行使保护责任”等论调。他强调，民主德国反对一切修改第二次世界大战结果、战后发展结果的企图。
    新华社柏林10月4日电（记者那福才）10月7日是民主德国成立40周年。节日前夕的首都柏林秋高气爽，景色宜人。绿色的草坪上铺盖着一层金黄色的落叶，家家户户的阳台上摆满了一盆盆鲜花，街心花园里更是花团锦簇、色彩缤纷。市场供应充足，蔬菜、肉类、瓜果和各类食品摆满了货架，百货商场的商品琳琅满目、应有尽有。人们沉浸在迎接节日的喜庆气氛之中。
    40年来，首都柏林和民主德国都发生了巨大的变化。第2次世界大战结束时，整个柏林市几乎成了一片废墟，60％的建筑物被炸成瓦砾。
    德国统一社会党1971年提出了“建设发达社会主义社会”的奋斗目标，并确定了“经济政策和社会福利政策相统一”的社会主义建设总方针，找到了一条符合本国具体情况的社会主义建设道路。
    从1971年起，民主德国的经济以每年平均递增4％左右的速度稳定发展。目前，它已经发展成为拥有门类齐全的现代化工业和农业的发达的社会主义国家。标志着国家经济实力的生产性国民收入，由建国初期的290亿马克增加到1987年的2600多亿马克，人均工业产值已跻入世界十大工业强国之列。
