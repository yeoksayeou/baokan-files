The Harbin Steam Turbine Factory has been conducting an "All-Around Excellence Competition" among its youth since last year. The participating young workers have achieved full marks in quality indicators, and their technical levels have generally improved by one grade. Through this activity, the factory has gained insights: youth are the future of the enterprise. As long as the work is done seriously, the youth have great potential.

A Matter of Concern

We asked Liu Jie, the factory director, about his views on the youth of the 1980s.

He said, the mainstream of the youth is good, with great potential, full of prospects and hope. However, over the past decade, with the return of educated youth to the cities, the retirement of older workers, the employment of urban youth, and the allocation of students from various levels and types of schools... wave after wave of youth have entered the factory gates, bearing the marks of history. Now, the tremendous social changes and complex social environment have had a profound impact on them.

For example, there is a severe shortage of frontline workers. In the past, the factory had only a few thousand workers and could operate in three shifts; now, with over ten thousand workers, it is even difficult to arrange two shifts. The reason is that some young workers are not willing to operate machines, thinking that "only those without skills become workers"; many young workers have only a primary school education, cannot read blueprints, and their technical skills are not solid. They cannot operate precision equipment, so the retirement age of older workers has to be extended; 80% of the accidents in the entire factory are caused by young workers...

As the factory director, Liu Jie is naturally worried. He said, our factory is the "national team" providing steam turbines for one-third of the country's power plants. How can such a successor team bear the increasingly heavy responsibility of providing energy equipment for the Four Modernizations?

The factory has always been working on improving the young workers, with activities like reading and speaking, new wedding ceremonies, and factory-aided countryside all having distinctive features. The Party Committee attaches importance to it, the Youth League is active, and the Trade Union extends support in various aspects. However, in the new situation, how to truly do a good job in youth work and improve their political, cultural, and technical qualities is still a matter that needs to be explored. The "All-Around Excellence Competition" was launched in this context.

The Spark and the Firewood

The secretary of the factory's Youth League, Duan Qihai, once vividly told us: "The All-Around Excellence Competition" could be lively, with the Youth League setting the stage and the entire factory performing, and Director Liu igniting the spark.

The four members of the Youth League delved into the workshops, investigating what the youth were thinking and what the factory needed. When the Youth League presented a plan for the All-Around Excellence Competition to the director, he immediately wrote his opinions on the plan: "The Youth League's idea is good! It should be valued and invested in."

The director's support is no surprise, as the competition was met with enthusiastic responses.

There must be a spark, but without a response, it won't work. Many hands make light work. The competition involved departments such as labor and resources, vocational education, production, security, safety technology, supervision, quality, civilized management, and the office, covering six aspects: production, technology, quality, safety, discipline, and politics, with 12 evaluation indicators. Each aspect and each indicator involved various parties, and a large amount of work was done by party members and cadres.

The Purpose is to Improve Quality

The youth of the 1980s like to show their tenacity. One should be good at guiding the youth to strive to be people with ideals and awareness.

At the age of 26, Hou Wanfa won this competition and immediately signed up for the second round, while also submitting an application to join the party. He clearly has new pursuits; Qu Jianrong is the only mother who reached the standard, saying that she participated in the competition not for anything else, but just to prove herself; young worker Hou Xin was transferred to a department without work hours during the competition, but he still insisted on reaching the finish line despite having no hope in six of the standards...

This is the nature of youth: self-respect and competitiveness. If you don't let them show themselves, they will find other places to show themselves, they will go to the dining table, mahjong table, and be immersed in karaoke all day. In fact, youth are not without a sense of social responsibility; it all depends on whether you give them a chance and a stage to perform.

Director Liu believes that this competition is not just about making them create 6.362 million yuan of production value in one year. The main purpose is to educate and train the youth. The various competition activities of the 1950s that emphasized tradition, compared contributions, and made them masters have revived in the factory. The grassroots leaders are at ease with issues like discipline, work hours, and quality.

This year, another thousand or so young workers have joined the "All-Around Excellence Competition."

    “全优达标赛”启示录
    白衍吉　庄进修　范力
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂从去年以来，在青年中搞了一年“全优达标竞赛”，参赛青年质量指标达到了全优，技术水平普遍提高了一级。厂里通过开展这一活动，使人获得启示：青年是企业的未来，只要认真做好工作，青年是大有作为的。
    令人关注的问题
    我们问刘杰厂长怎么看80年代的青年。
    他说，他们主流好，潜力大，充满前途和希望。但是，十几年来，知青大返城，退休接班，社会青年就业，各级各类学校分配的学生……一批批青年带着历史的痕迹涌进了工厂大门。如今，巨大的社会变革，复杂的社会环境给予他们以深刻的影响。
    比如，一线工人严重缺乏。过去工厂只几千人，可以三班生产；现在人数过万，竟连安排两班也费劲，原因是一些青工不安心看机床，认为“没有本事才当工人”；许多青工只有小学文化水平，看不懂图纸，技术不过硬。精密设备操作不了，只得延长退休工人的“服役期”；全厂80％的事故出在青工身上……
    作为厂长，刘杰当然为此心忧。他说，我厂是为全国1／3的电站提供汽轮机的“国家队”，这样的后续部队，怎能担负起日趋繁重的为四化建设提供能源设备的重任呢！
    对此，厂里一直在抓提高青工的工作，像读书演讲、婚事新办、厂帮乡等活动都很有特点。党委重视，团委工作很积极，工会各方面也都伸手给予支持。但在新形势下，怎样真正做好青年工作，提高他们的政治、文化、技术素质，还是需要很好探索的一件事。“全优达标赛”就是在这种背景下开展起来的。
    播火者与众人拾柴
    厂团委书记段其海曾形象地对我们说：“全优达标赛”能活跃起来，是团委搭台，全厂唱戏，刘厂长给点了一把火。
    厂团委的4名同志一头扎到车间，调查青年在想什么，工厂需要什么。当团委把一份全优达标竞赛方案拿给厂长的时候，厂长当即在方案上写了自己的意见：“团委的想法很好！既要重视，又应投资。”
    厂长重视，怪不得竞赛一呼百应。
    有播火的，没有呼应的不行。众人拾柴火焰高。竞赛牵涉到劳资、职教、生产、保卫、安技、监察、质量、文明办、办公室等部门，分产量、技术、质量、安全、纪律、政治6方面内容，12项考核指标，每个内容，每项指标，都牵动着方方面面，大量的工作是党员、干部干的。
    目的在于提高素质
    80年代的青年喜欢顽强地表现自己。要善于引导青年努力做一个有理想、有觉悟的人。
    26岁的侯万发在这次竞赛中获胜，他又报名参加第二届竞赛，同时还递交了入党申请书，他分明还有新的追求；曲建荣是孩子妈妈中唯一一名达标的，她说自己参赛不为别的，就是为了争口气；青工侯昕在竞赛的中途调到一个没有工时指标的部门，可他仍在6项达标没有希望的情况下坚持跑到终点……这就是青年的“天性”：自尊、好胜。你不让他表现，他会到别处表现，会去找酒桌、麻将桌，整天陶醉在卡拉OK之中。其实，青年不乏社会责任感，就看你给不给他一个表演的机会和舞台。
    刘厂长认为，这个竞赛绝不仅仅是能使他们一年多创造的636.2万元的产值，主要目的是使青年受到教育和锻炼。50年代那种讲传统、比贡献、做主人的各种竞赛活动在工厂兴起来，基层领导在纪律、工时、质量这些操心的问题上放心了。
    今年全厂又有千余名青工加入到“全优达标竞赛”的队伍中。
