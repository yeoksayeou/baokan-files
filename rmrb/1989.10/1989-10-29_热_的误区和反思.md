The phenomenon of overheating in the economic sphere has been prevalent in China for a long time. Without going too far back, in recent years, we have seen the construction boom, the company boom, the import boom for high-end consumer goods, the suit boom, the boom in the production of color TVs and refrigerators, the boom in soft packaging… Now, some places are showing signs of a "mulberry garden boom."

Indeed, the "booms" of recent years are different from those of the 1950s and 1960s. Market regulation and price guidance have shown significant progress.

However, the "booms" of recent years still share some common misconceptions with those of the past. First, there is an eagerness for change, a desire for quick success, and a tendency to seek shortcuts, coupled with a lack of understanding and respect for objective economic laws and modern market principles. Second, there is a lack of independent judgment, with herd mentality turning into herd behavior, leading to a rush to join in. Additionally, the current market is not fully developed, and information services are underdeveloped. The so-called price signals often contain distortions and inaccuracies, making scientific decision-making even more difficult.

Years of experience have taught us that "booms" not only fail to solve economic development problems but also, by violating the laws of supply and demand balance, industrial balance, and rational resource allocation, only create new imbalances and new problems.

The production of a single commodity is not necessarily better the more it is produced. Overproduction not only yields no benefits but can even result in negative benefits.

Development speed is not necessarily better the faster it is. Exceeding the critical point of social tolerance results in haste making waste.

To ensure that China's economy develops steadily and sustainably, to reduce the amplitude of economic fluctuations, and to avoid wasting precious time on necessary adjustments and rectifications, we must be vigilant and avoid falling into the "boom" trap. What is most needed is to study and master the intrinsic laws of socialist commodity economy with planning, to seriously implement industrial policies, to emphasize scientific forecasting and information exchange, to strengthen planning and forecasting, and to avoid, or at least minimize, doing things that go against our intentions. Only in this way can good intentions be aligned with good results.

　　“热”的误区和反思
　　凌霄子
    经济领域中的过热现象，在我国由来已久。远的不说，近几年中，基建热、公司热、高档消费品进口热、西服热、彩电冰箱生产热、软包装热……，现在一些地方又来了“桑园热”的苗头。
    诚然，这几年的“热”，与五六十年代的“热”已经有所不同。市场调节，价格引导，表现了很大的进步。
    但是，这几年的“热”和以往的
  “热”仍然有着某些共同的误区。一是思变心切，急于求成，贪走捷径，对客观经济规律和现代市场法则认识不足，尊重不够；二是缺少独立判断，从众心理变为从众行为，一哄而起。加上目前市场发育不完善，咨讯不发达，所谓的价格信号往往带有一定的扭曲和水份，更增大了科学决策的难度。
    多年的教训告诉我们，“热”不仅不能解决经济发展问题，而且由于它违背了供求平衡、产业均衡以及资源合理配置等方面的规律，只会造成新的失衡和新的问题。
    单项商品的生产并非越多越好。生产过剩，不仅无效益，甚至带来负效益。
    发展速度也并非越快越好。超过社会承受力的临界点，结果是欲速而不达。
    为了使我国经济持续稳定发展，为了减少经济震荡的幅度，为了不再把宝贵的时间用于迫不得已的调整、整顿上面，我们必须注意，不要走进“热”的误区。最需要的是研究和掌握社会主义有计划的商品经济的内在规律，认真执行产业政策，重视科学预测和信息交流，加强计划性和预报性，少做以至不做“事与愿违”的蠢事，这样，良好动机才能与良好效果统一起来。
