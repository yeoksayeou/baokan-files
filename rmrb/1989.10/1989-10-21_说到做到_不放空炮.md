Why has the construction of clean government in Suizhou City been effective?
Why has the clearing of empty houses in Harbin City not been a mere formality?
Keeping Promises and Avoiding Empty Talk

Wei Zhaogang from the Propaganda Department of the Suizhou Municipal Committee writes: At the beginning of this year, our municipal committee and government proposed that in the first half of the year, we would first focus on four aspects of clean government construction. Several months have passed. How has it been done? First, to curb the trend of extravagant banquets. The municipal committee's standing committee members jointly wrote a letter in mid-January to various townships, suburban districts, and municipal departments, stipulating that when the municipal committee's standing committee members go to the grassroots level to work, the grassroots units should receive them simply, without tobacco and alcohol entertainment, and collect the meal fees according to the regulations. The municipal committee secretary, Yang Baosheng, has repeatedly emphasized that those who use public funds to feast extravagantly will be severely punished once discovered. At present, the trend of extravagant banquets has been basically curbed throughout the city.

In mid-February, the municipal committee decided to thoroughly clean up the private houses built by cadres and staff since 1987. In four months, 128 households who built private houses have paid a total of 149,600 yuan in additional taxes and price differences, and those who built private houses have started to return public housing.

The work of cleaning up and rectifying circulation companies and investigating and dealing with party members and cadres who violate discipline and the law has also achieved results. After focusing on cleaning up and rectifying 55 companies, their appearance has been renewed. Companies that belong to party and government agencies have been separated from the government and economy. From January to June, the city has investigated and dealt with 685 cases of party members violating discipline and the law, and 50 party members and 9 cadres have received party and administrative disciplinary sanctions.

Xu Zhixian from the Harbin Municipal Construction Commission writes: Recently, the municipal committee and government of Harbin decided that in the second half of this year, the city will focus on cleaning up disciplinary issues in the housing construction of party and government cadres. To do a good job in the clearing of empty houses, the city has established a leading group and quickly started work. At the same time, it mobilized the masses to report. According to statistics, the masses have reported 46 clues about the use of improper funds by leaders of party and government agencies, enterprises, and public institutions to purchase housing, with a reported amount of 6.309 million yuan. On September 9, the seven districts and two counties (cities) of the city took unified action, removed obstacles, conducted a comprehensive investigation, and sealed off 94 empty houses in one go, including 6 for bureau-level cadres, 5 for section-level cadres, and 74 for general cadres. The municipal committee leaders require that the city's clearing of empty houses work should not be a mere formality.

　　随州市廉政建设为何有成效？
　　哈尔滨市清房为何没走过场？
　　说到做到　不放空炮
    湖北随州市委宣传部　魏兆刚来信：今年初，我市市委、市政府提出，上半年首先抓好廉政建设4件事。几个月过去了，做得如何呢？先刹吃喝风。市委常委于1月中旬联名给各个乡镇、城郊区和市直各部门写信，规定市委常委下基层工作，基层单位接待一律从简，不准烟酒招待，按规定收取伙食费。市委书记杨宝生多次强调，用公款大吃大喝的，一经发现，严惩不贷。目前，全市基本上刹住了吃喝风。
    2月中旬，市委决定全面清理1987年以来干部职工营建私房。4个月时间，已有128户建私房者补交税费、差价款14.96万元，建了私房的已开始退公房。
    清理整顿流通公司和查处违纪违法党员干部这两项工作也收到成效。55家公司经重点清理整顿，面貌一新，属于党政机关办的公司，实行政企分开，经济脱钩。1至6月，全市共立案查处党员违纪违法案件685起，有50名党员、9名干部分别受到党纪政纪处分。
    哈尔滨市建委　徐志宪来信：最近，哈尔滨市委、市政府决定，今年下半年，全市重点清理党政干部在住房建房中的违纪问题。为了搞好清房工作，市里成立了领导小组，迅速开展工作。同时，发动群众举报。据统计，群众举报党政机关、企事业单位领导干部用不正当资金购买住房的线索有46件，举报金额达630.9万元。9月9日，全市七区两县（市）统一行动，排除阻力，全面清查，一举查封94套空闲住房，其中厅局级干部6套，处级干部5套，一般干部74套。市委领导同志要求全市清房工作不走过场。
