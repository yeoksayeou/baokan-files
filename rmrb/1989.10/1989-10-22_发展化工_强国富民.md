Since the founding of New China, the Party and the government have attached great importance to and cared for the development of the chemical industry. The earliest Dalian Chemical Industry Company (formerly Dalian Chemical Plant) was visited by 15 Party and state leaders, including Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Song Qingling, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, Lin Bochu, and Deng Yingchao. In some important stages of development, the Party Central Committee and the State Council put forward correct guidelines, policies, and directions for the development of the chemical industry, ensuring that the chemical industry developed in a healthy direction. Over the past 40 years, the state has invested more than 10 billion yuan in the chemical industry, laying an important material foundation for its development.

On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, Premier Li Peng inscribed for the chemical industry: "Develop the chemical industry to strengthen the nation and enrich the people"; Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Xiannian also wrote: "Develop the chemical industry to serve socialist modernization."

Starting from Ruins

The chemical industry of New China started from the ruins left by the old China.

Originally, China's chemical industry had a long history. Among the Four Great Inventions of ancient China, papermaking and gunpowder were both achieved through chemical methods. The artifacts unearthed from the Mawangdui Han tombs reflect the high level of dyeing and lacquer production and use in the Han Dynasty. Due to the long-term constraints of the feudal system and the aggression of imperialism, the development of China's chemical industry was very slow. Until the early 20th century, there were only a few small workshops such as the Tianjin Yongli Chemical Industry Company established by patriotic figures like Fan Xudong and the Shanghai Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory established by Wu Yunchu. These enterprises could only produce a few basic chemical products, as well as some low-grade paints, rubber products, low-grade sulfur dyes, cough syrups, and eye drops, with raw materials still relying on imports.

The establishment of New China opened up a broad path for the development of the chemical industry. In the early days of the founding of the nation, despite the fact that the country was in a state of desolation and everything needed to be rebuilt, a great deal of effort was still devoted to the restoration of the chemical industry. During the First Five-Year Plan, the main task of the chemical industry was: "Actively develop chemical fertilizers, correspondingly develop acid, alkali, and dye industries, and strengthen the coordination between the chemical industry and the coking, petroleum, and non-ferrous metal industries." The focus was on building new chemical industry bases, forming the initial shape of the three chemical industry complexes in Jilin, Lanzhou, and Taiyuan.

After 1955, the state clearly emphasized that the chemical industry was related to the development of agriculture, industry, transportation, logistics, national defense industry, and the improvement of people's lives, and everyone should pay attention to and support it.

At that time, Vice Premier Chen Yun conducted investigations and research on the development of nitrogen fertilizer industry and made detailed arrangements for issues such as construction scale, material supply, equipment centralized manufacturing, and complete sets of supplies. On this basis, a batch of enterprises that were then called "large chemical fertilizers" and are now called "medium chemical fertilizers" were built. The leaders of the chemical industry and a large number of scientific and technological workers, in order to implement the major decision of the Party Central Committee on industrial support for agriculture, created small nitrogen fertilizer production technology and fertilizer varieties suitable for China's national conditions, laying the foundation for the development of the small chemical fertilizer industry. China's chemical industry showed a new vitality.

The development of China's petroleum industry provided conditions for the development of petrochemicals. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou personally decided to introduce 13 sets of large-scale synthetic ammonia equipment using natural gas and light oil as raw materials and 2 sets of large-scale ethylene equipment, establishing the raw material route of coal, oil, and gas for the development of China's chemical industry.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, the "adjustment, reform, rectification, and improvement" policy made the chemical industry enter a historical stage centered on improving economic benefits. The chemical industry firmly adjusted the direction of investment and product structure, shut down a number of small chemical fertilizer and small chemical enterprises with high consumption and low efficiency, and focused on the development of compound fertilizers, basic chemical raw materials, fine chemicals, petrochemicals. The development of organic raw materials, rubber products, and new materials was appropriately accelerated, and the proportion of investment in scientific research and education was increased, making the layout, product structure, and economic benefits of the chemical industry all have new improvements. Since the implementation of the Seventh Five-Year Plan, based on the large-scale transformation of enterprises, the overall strengthening of enterprise management, and the significant improvement of product quality, a number of large-scale chemical mines, large-scale fertilizer equipment, and petrochemical equipment have been built and put into production, making the production technology level and the strength of the chemical industry significantly enhanced.

Remarkable Changes

After 40 years of construction and development, the chemical industry has formed a chemical industry system that combines large, medium, and small enterprises, with a relatively reasonable layout and a relatively complete range of categories.

Currently, there are more than 6,000 state-owned chemical enterprises above the county level in the chemical system, with more than 3.2 million employees, forming 23 industries including chemical mines, chemical fertilizers, chemical pesticides, basic inorganic chemical raw materials, basic organic chemical raw materials, chemical dyes, chemical coatings, information chemicals, and rubber products, and can produce more than 37,000 varieties and specifications of chemical products.

Over the past 40 years, China's chemical industry has advanced at an average annual growth rate of 18.2% (excluding petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, the same below). In 1949, China's total chemical output value was only 177 million yuan, and by 1988 it had reached 6.86 billion yuan, achieving a total profit and tax revenue of 1.847 billion yuan, equivalent to 2.2 times the investment in the same period. The output of major chemical products has also increased by tens, hundreds, and thousands of times.

For example, fertilizers, which had only 57,000 tons before the founding of the nation, reached 17.268 million tons in 1988; sulfuric acid increased from 400,000 tons to 11.11 million tons; soda ash increased from 88,000 tons to 2.619 million tons; caustic soda increased from 15,000 tons to 2.978 million tons; tires increased from 30,000 to nearly 30 million. Some chemical products' output has already ranked among the world's top. For example, the output of calcium carbide ranks first in the world; the output of synthetic ammonia and dyes ranks second in the world; the output of fertilizers, sulfuric acid, pesticides, and soda ash ranks third in the world; the output of phosphate ore and pyrite ore reached 1.821 million tons and 1.116 million tons, respectively, both ranking fourth in the world.

Over the past 40 years, the chemical system has introduced several hundred or even more than a thousand new products into production each year. Fertilizers, which originally had only one type of "fertilizer powder" (ammonium sulfate), now have dozens of varieties, and the varieties needed for agriculture are basically complete, with the proportion of high-concentration and compound fertilizers increasing. Photographic materials, which were entirely dependent on imports before the founding of the nation, now have more than 200 varieties. In 1988, the output of domestically produced color film represented by "Lekai," "Shenguang," and "Huaguang" reached more than 10 million rolls. The late-starting magnetic recording materials have also developed, with an annual output of more than 7 billion meters of magnetic tape.

The Contribution of Large Enterprises

By the end of 1987, the chemical system had 5 super-large enterprises, 145 large enterprises, and 489 medium-sized enterprises. These large backbone chemical enterprises not only provide the country with a large number of products and accumulation but also provide technology, experience, and talent for the development of the chemical industry. The Jilin Chemical Industry Company is the first chemical production base built in China, with 100,000 employees, more than 2 billion yuan in assets, 110 sets of equipment, and a total output value of 2.72 billion yuan in 1988, achieving a profit and tax revenue of 1.2 billion yuan. Its products are sold to dozens of countries and regions and can export complete sets of technology. The Dalian Chemical Industry Company is a large chemical enterprise mainly producing inorganic chemical raw materials and fertilizers and is currently the largest soda ash production plant in China. Since the founding of the nation, it has provided the country with a cumulative 16.35 million tons of soda ash, accounting for half of the total soda ash production in the same period in the country, and has paid a total of 2.98 billion yuan in taxes to the state, equivalent to 3.9 times the total investment of the state, and has trained more than 14,000 cadres and technical personnel for chemical departments, enterprises, and institutions at all levels across the country.

The chemical system also pays attention to the work of personnel, cultivating a team that can fight hard battles. The characteristics of the chemical industry are high temperature, high pressure, flammability, and explosiveness. Under such conditions of production, it is required that workers have a high level of political awareness, strict labor discipline, and a certain level of technology. Large enterprises in the chemical system generally advocate four kinds of spirit: the spirit of hard work and perseverance, not afraid of difficulties in pioneering; the spirit of meticulousness, persistence, and strict management; the spirit of not being content with the status quo and striving for the best; the spirit of dedication and contribution to one's post, achieving good results.

In particular, since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, chemical enterprises have carried out activities to create leak-free factories, clean and civilized factories, and "six-good" enterprises (referred to as "three-creations" activities) throughout the industry. The implementation of this activity has not only improved enterprise management but also improved the quality of people.

The national economy is developing rapidly, and the chemical industry has a wide range of services and strong coordination. According to the requirements of "developing the chemical industry to strengthen the nation and enrich the people," greater efforts need to be made, and the task is arduous and the road is long!

　　发展化工  强国富民
　　我国化学工业在旧中国遗留下的废墟上艰难起步，经过40年的建设和发展，如今成为国民经济重要支柱产业之一
　　曲华真
    新中国成立以来，党和政府十分重视和关心化学工业的发展。我国最早的大连化学工业公司（前身大连化学厂），就有周恩来、朱德、宋庆龄、邓小平、陈云、林伯渠、邓颖超等15位党和国家领导人前去视察。在一些重要的发展阶段，党中央、国务院提出了发展化工的正确方针、路线和政策，使化学工业沿着健康方向发展。40年来，国家对化工投资达1000多亿元，为化工发展奠定了重要的物质基础。
    建国40周年前夕，国务院总理李鹏为化学工业题词：“发展化工强国富民”；全国政协主席李先念也欣然命笔：“发展化工，为社会主义现代化服务。”
　　在废墟上艰难起步
    新中国的化学工业，是在旧中国遗留下来的废墟上艰难起步的。
    本来，我国的化工具有悠久的历史，古代四大发明中，造纸、火药就是运用了化学的方法。马王堆汉墓出土文物，反映了我国汉代制作和使用染料、生漆已有较高水平。由于长期封建制度的束缚，加上帝国主义的侵略，中国的化学工业发展十分缓慢。直到20世纪初，只有范旭东等爱国志士创办的天津永利化学工业公司和吴蕴初办的上海天源电化厂等少数手工作坊式的企业，而且仅能生产几个基础化工品种，以及一些低档油漆、橡胶制品、低级硫化染料、咳嗽糖浆、眼药水之类，原料还依赖进口。
    新中国的建立，为化学工业的发展开辟了广阔道路。建国之初，国家百废待兴，仍拿出很大精力恢复化学工业。在第一个五年计划期间，化学工业的主要任务是：“积极发展化学肥料，相应发展酸、碱、染料工业，加强化学工业与炼焦、石油、有色金属工业的配合。”重点建设新的化学工业基地，形成吉林、兰州、太原三个化工联合企业的雏形。
      1955年以后，国家明确强调，化学工业关系着农业、工业、交通、运输业、国防工业的发展和人民生活的提高，大家都要重视和支持。
      当时的副总理陈云对发展氮肥工业作了调查研究，并对建设规模、材料供应、设备定点制造和成套供应等重要问题进行了详细安排。在此基础上建设了一批当时称为“大化肥”，现在称为“中化肥”的化肥骨干企业。化工部门的领导者和一大批科技工作者，为了实现党中央关于工业支援农业的重大决策，创造了适合我国国情的小氮肥生产工艺和化肥品种，奠定了小化肥工业发展的基础。我国化学工业出现了一派新的生机。
      我国石油工业的发展为发展石油化工提供了条件。毛主席、周恩来亲自决策，先后引进了13套以天然气和轻油为原料的大型合成氨装置和2套大型乙烯装置，确立了发展我国化学工业煤油气并举的原料路线。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，“调整、改革、整顿、提高”的八字方针，使化学工业进入一个以提高经济效益为中心的历史阶段。化工部门坚决地调整投资方向和产品结构，关停了一批消耗高、效益差的小化肥、小化工企业，重点发展了复合肥料、基本化工原料、精细化工、石油化工，适当加快了有机原料、橡胶制品、新兴材料的发展，增加了对科研教育的投资比重，使化学工业的布局、产品结构、经济效益都有新的提高。“七五”计划实施以来，在对企业进行较大规模改造、全面加强企业管理、大力提高产品质量的基础上，相继建成和投产一批大型化学矿山、大型化肥装置和石油化工装置，使生产技术水平有新的提高，化学工业的实力大大增强。
　　令人瞩目的变化
    经过40年的建设和发展，化学工业已经形成了一个大中小企业相结合、布局大体合理、门类比较齐全的化学工业体系。
      目前，化工系统县以上国营化工企业6000多个，职工达320多万人，形成了包括化学矿山、化学肥料、化学农药、基本无机化工原料、基本有机化工原料、化学染料、化学涂料、信息用化学品、橡胶制品等23个行业，能生产化工产品品种和规格3.7万多个。
    40年，我国化学工业以平均18.2％（不含石油化工、医药，下同）速度向前迈进。1949年我国化工总产值仅为1.77亿元，到1988年已达到686亿元，实现利税总额达1847亿元，相当同期投资的2.2倍。主要化工产品产量也以成十、成百、成千倍的增长。
    如化肥，建国前只有0.57万吨，1988年达到1726.8万吨；硫酸从4万吨发展到1111万吨；纯碱从8.8万吨发展到261.9万吨；烧碱从1.5万吨发展到297.8万吨；轮胎从3万条发展到近3000万条。有一些化工产品的产量已名列世界的前茅。如电石产量居世界第一；合成氨、染料产量居世界第二；化肥、硫酸、农药、纯碱产量居世界第三；磷矿、硫铁矿产量分别达到1821万吨和1116万吨，均居世界第四。
    40年中，化工系统每年约有几百甚至上千个新产品投入生产。化肥，原来只有一个“肥田粉”（硫铵），现在增加有几十个品种，农业需用品种基本齐全，高浓度、复合肥料的比重不断增大。感光材料建国前全部依靠进口，现在品种达200多个。1988年以“乐凯”、“申光”、“华光”为代表的国产彩色胶卷产量已达1000万卷以上。起步较晚的磁性记录材料也发展起来，磁带年产量达70多亿米。
　　大型企业贡献巨大
    到1987年底，化工系统有特大型企业5个，大型企业145个，中型企业489个。这些大型骨干化工企业不仅为国家提供大量的产品和积累，而且还为化学工业发展提供了技术、经验和人才。吉林化学工业公司是我国建设起来的第一个化工生产基地，现有10万职工，20多亿元资产，110套装置，1988年完成产值27.2亿元，实现利税12亿元，产品销往几十个国家和地区，并能出口成套技术。大连化学工业公司是以生产无机化工原料和化肥为主的大型化工企业，也是我国目前最大的纯碱生产厂，建国以来累计为国家提供纯碱1635万吨，占全国纯碱同期总产量的一半，共向国家上交利税29.8亿元，相当于国家投资总额3.9倍，并为全国各级化工部门企业和事业单位输送了14000多名干部和技术人员。
    化工系统还注意抓紧人的工作，培养一支能打硬仗的队伍。化学工业的特点：高温、高压、易燃、易爆。在这样的条件生产，要求职工有较高的政治觉悟，严格的劳动纪律和一定的技术水平。化工系统的大企业普遍提倡四种精神：苦干实干、不怕困难的艰苦创业精神；一丝不苟、坚持不懈从严治厂的精神；不甘落后，争创一流的不断进取精神；立足本职，建功立业的积极奉献精神，取得了好的效果。
    特别是十一届三中全会以来，化工企业在全行业开展了创建无泄漏工厂、清洁文明工厂和“六好”企业的活动（简称“三创”活动）。这项活动的开展，既改善了企业管理，又提高了人的素质。
      国民经济在飞速发展，化学工业服务面广，配套性强，按照“发展化工，强国富民”的要求，需要作出更大的努力，任重而道远！
