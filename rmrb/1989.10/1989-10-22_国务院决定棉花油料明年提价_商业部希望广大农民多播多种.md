    The State Council has decided to raise the procurement prices for cotton and oilseeds next year. A responsible official from the Ministry of Commerce hopes that local authorities will promptly convey this information to farmers, encouraging them to plant more oilseeds and retain more cotton fields.

    According to the official, while summer oil production increased this year, procurement decreased. Autumn oil production is also on a downward trend. Cotton production faces challenges due to a reduction in planting area by over 7 million mu (approximately 467,000 hectares) and significant losses in some areas, making it difficult to complete procurement tasks. To boost farmers' enthusiasm for planting cotton and oilseed crops, the State Council has decided to raise the prices for cotton and oilseeds next year, aiming to increase the effective supply in society.

　　国务院决定棉花油料明年提价
　　商业部希望广大农民多播多种
    本报讯　记者刘霄报道：国务院决定明年提高棉花、油料的收购价格，商业部负责同志希望各地及时向农民传达这一信息，争取多种一些油菜籽，多留一些棉花田。
    据这位负责人介绍，今年夏油增产，但是收购减少，秋油又是减产趋势，棉花由于面积减少700多万亩，有的地方受灾较重，完成收购任务也有一定的难度。为了调动广大农民种植棉花和油料作物的积极性，国务院决定明年提高棉花和油料的价格，以增加社会有效供给。
