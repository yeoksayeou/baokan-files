Luan County in Hebei Province has been actively promoting clean governance by commending exemplary officials and openly addressing and rectifying misconduct. This approach has been effective in educating officials and gaining the trust of the public.

To advocate for clean governance, since June this year, the county's relevant departments have selected 15 exemplary officials from villages, enterprises, and government agencies who are known for their integrity and clean record. These officials have been widely publicized through radio, television, and meetings, sparking strong reactions in society.

Since late July, the county has also held county-wide radio meetings to publicly address and rectify the misconduct of party members and officials. Additionally, the county has conducted a comprehensive review and correction of issues such as financial management chaos and the misuse of public funds for banquets. Over the past few years, 4,790 people in the county have been granted professional titles, but there have been instances of individuals obtaining titles without the necessary qualifications, such as becoming a doctor without practicing medicine or a certified accountant without being an accountant. To address this, the county has established an investigation team to review these cases. So far, 70 people have been found to have falsified information and obtained titles fraudulently.

    滦县多办实事倡廉肃贪
    本报讯　河北省滦县县委、县政府在廉政建设中，大力表彰先进，敢于亮丑揭短，从正反两方面教育干部，取信于群众。
    为倡导为政清廉，从今年6月以来，县委有关部门经过调查，从农村、企业、机关挑选了15个清政廉洁的典型，在广播、电视、座谈会上广为宣传，在社会上引起强烈反响。
    7月下旬以来，该县还通过召开全县广播大会等形式，公开处理了违纪的党员干部。此外，针对普遍存在的财务管理混乱和用公款吃喝等问题，进行全面清理、纠正。近几年来，该县有4790多人评上了技术职称，但未当过医生评上了医师、未当过会计评上了会计师的大有人在。为此，该县成立了清查小组进行审查。现已查出70多人有弄虚作假、骗取职称等问题。（张景田）
