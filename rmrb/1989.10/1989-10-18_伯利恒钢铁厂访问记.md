Recently, the reporter traveled from New York to Bethlehem City in Pennsylvania to visit the second-largest steel plant in the United States, Bethlehem Steel. This plant has a history of over a hundred years, but its equipment has almost all been renovated and updated, giving the old plant new vitality. In the steelmaking workshop, the reporter saw that the molten iron from the blast furnace automatically flows into the oxygen converter, and in less than fifty minutes, it is turned into red-hot molten steel, which is then directly cast into steel ingots. The speed of the steel production process is astonishing!

The manager and engineers of Bethlehem Steel explained that the United States currently produces over 80 million tons of steel annually, which is still not enough, and the steel industry must continue to develop to meet the needs of economic growth. They disagree with the notion that the steel industry is a "sunset industry." Whether it is high-rise buildings, machinery, bridges, automobiles, ships, railways, trains, or even household appliances, all require steel. In terms of defense, various weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and ships all cannot do without steel. The developing plastics and other new materials have not yet been able to completely replace steel.

While maintaining a certain level of steel production, American steel enterprises are particularly focused on improving steel quality to escape the fate of being a "sunset industry." In recent years, Bethlehem Steel has emphasized scientific research to improve steel quality, achieving noticeable results. The plant began producing electro-galvanized thin steel plates in 1986, significantly enhancing corrosion resistance, which has been welcomed by the domestic automobile manufacturing and construction sectors. This year, it started large-scale production of zinc-nickel plated steel, which has even stronger corrosion resistance and has been adopted by automobile manufacturers in Japan and Western Europe.

The plant manager, Reading, said that steel enterprises must ensure profitability to survive and develop. Since the 1970s, the U.S. steel industry has been in a state of stagnation and decline for a relatively long period. However, in the past four years, U.S. steel production has increased by 4%, and several major steel plants have turned from losses to profits. Bethlehem Steel sold $4.33 billion worth of steel in 1986, incurring a loss of $1.53 billion, while in 1988, it sold $5.489 billion worth of steel, making a profit of $403 million.

The fundamental way for the plant to make a profit is to reduce costs and improve efficiency. In 1982, the plant had eight subsidiaries, 70,600 employees, and production equipment capable of producing 22 million tons of steel annually, with a utilization rate of 48%. After renovations, by 1988, the plant had only five subsidiaries, 3,200 employees, and production equipment capable of producing 16 million tons of steel annually, but the utilization rate reached 80%. In terms of personnel, the plant's production efficiency has increased by one-third in the past three years: in 1986, each person produced 360 tons of steel per year; in 1987, it was 410 tons; and in 1988, it was 495 tons.

Bethlehem Steel is planning how to meet the needs of the 21st century for steel. They believe that the key to maintaining a strong competitive edge for their steel products in the international market is to further improve quality and reduce costs. To this end, the plant will strengthen research and development, using new technologies to produce various new types of steel with higher strength, greater load-bearing capacity, better formability, and stronger corrosion resistance to compete with newly developed composite materials. As for further reducing costs, the solution is not easy. In 1988, the production cost per ton of steel in the United States was $438.19, which, although lower than Japan's $483.90, was much higher than the UK's $380.49, and also higher than the costs in France and West Germany.

    伯利恒钢铁厂访问记
    本报记者  刘开宸
    不久前，记者从纽约赴宾夕法尼亚州的伯利恒城，访问了美国第二大钢铁厂——伯利恒钢铁厂。这是个有一百多年历史的老厂，但是，设备差不多已全部被改造、更新，老厂呈现新的活力。在炼钢车间，记者看到，高炉炼出的铁水，自动流入氧气炼钢炉，不到五十分钟，就炼成火红的钢水，然后直接铸浇钢锭。钢铁生产过程之快速，令人惊奇！
  伯利恒钢铁厂的经理和工程师们解释说，美国现在每年产钢八千多万吨，还不够用，必须继续发展钢铁工业，才能适应经济发展的需要。他们从现实的经济生活出发，不同意钢铁工业是“夕阳工业”的说法。举凡高楼大厦、机械、桥梁、汽车、船舶、铁路、火车甚至家用电器等，都需要钢铁。在国防方面，各种武器、车辆、飞机、舰艇等都离不开钢铁。正在发展中的塑料等新型材料，并未能完全代替钢铁。
    美国钢铁企业在保持一定钢铁产量的同时，特别注意提高钢铁质量，以求摆脱“夕阳工业”的命运。近几年伯利恒钢铁厂为提高钢铁质量，抓紧科学研究，取得明显效果。该厂在一九八六年开始生产电镀薄钢板，防腐蚀性大为加强，受到本国汽车制造业和建筑部门的欢迎。今年，开始大规模生产镀锌镍钢板，防腐蚀性更强，已被日本和西欧国家汽车制造厂家采用。
    该厂经理雷丁格说，钢铁企业要生存发展，必须保证盈利。自七十年代以来，美国钢铁工业在较长时期内处于停滞和不景气状态。但是，近四年，美国钢铁生产增长百分之四，几大钢铁厂转亏为盈。伯利恒钢铁厂一九八六年售出钢材四十三点三亿美元，亏损一点五三亿美元，而一九八八年售出钢材五十四点八九亿美元，盈利四点零三亿美元。
    该厂盈利的根本途径是降低成本，提高效益。一九八二年这个厂有八个分厂，职工七万零六百人，拥有年产二千二百万吨钢的生产设备，利用率为百分之四十八。经过改造，到一九八八年，该厂仅有五个分厂，职工三千二百人，年产一千六百万吨钢的生产设备，但利用率达百分之八十。以人员计，该厂生产效率在近三年内提高三分之一：一九八六年，每人每年产钢三百六十吨；一九八七年为四百一十吨；一九八八年为四百九十五吨。
    伯利恒钢铁厂正在计划如何适应二十一世纪对钢铁的需要。他们认为，使自己的钢铁产品在国际市场上保持强大的竞争力，关键是进一步改进质量，降低成本。为此，该厂将加强科研，利用新技术生产强度更高、承受力更大、成形性更好、防腐蚀性更强的各种新型钢材，与新发展的复合材料抗争。至于进一步降低成本，解决不易。一九八八年，美国吨钢生产成本为四百三十八点一九美元，虽低于日本的四百八十三点九美元，但远高于英国的三百八十点四九美元，比法国和联邦德国的成本也高。
