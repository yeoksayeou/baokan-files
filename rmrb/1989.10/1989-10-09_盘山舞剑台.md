Pan Mountain, located within the jurisdiction of Ji County, Tianjin, is situated 90 kilometers to the east of Beijing, at the southern foot of the Yanshan Mountains. It is at the confluence of the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan triangle. Pan Mountain is composed of acid magma from the deep crust of the ancient earth, forming granite, which is different from the surrounding limestone mountains. It has unique peaks, clear rocks and water, lush forests, and beautiful scenery.

Pan Mountain has three famous sites: Sanpan, Wufeng, Bashi, and seventy-two temples. Among the five peaks, the Sword Dance Platform is particularly famous.

The Sword Dance Platform is located to the northwest of Wansong Temple. Wansong Temple is the largest temple in Pan Mountain. "Dragons encircle the mountains, and phoenix waters meander," "green mountains and green waters, with vines, moon, and pine wind." Originally named Li Jing An or Wei Gong An, it was named after the Tang Dynasty general Li Jing who once lived here. Li Jing's original name was Yao Shi. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, he served as the Minister of War and the Right Vice-Premier. He led troops to the border, defeating the invading Eastern Turks and Tujue, achieving outstanding military exploits, and was enfeoffed as the Duke of Wei. During his stay here, Li Jing once ascended the platform to dance with a sword.

The Sword Dance Platform is thirty zhang high, entirely made of granite, with a steep shape, stone steps for climbing, and a flat top. According to the "Jin Gu Kao," "In the 19th year of Zhenguan, the Emperor campaigned against Goguryeo, and the Duke, as an elder, accompanied him, appreciating the scenery. Looking west to the Yanshan Mountains and east to the Liaodong Sea, he drew his sword and danced." Li Jing, in his enthusiasm, sang a song called "Sword Dance Song": "Ascending the high hills to look around, holding the rainbow and breaking the flying rainbow. Alas, the three armies sing of victory and return." The clouds and rainbows are colorful, the sky wind howls, the sword shadow is in the air, the momentum is magnificent, and the enthusiasm soars, showing the heroic spirit of a great hero with great ambitions and overwhelming might.

The platform is famous for its name, and the name is famous for the platform. The patriotic hero is admired by people of all ages. In the Ming Dynasty, Qi Jiguang left a famous poem here: "The frost horn sounds, the grass and trees wither, the clouds rise, and the stone gate opens. The northern wind and border wine cannot get drunk, the setting sun and countless crows return. If only the carved halberd can eliminate the killing intent, it doesn't matter if the white hair is old on the border. Who can I name on the famous peak? The old Li General's Sword Dance Platform." Expressing admiration for Li Jing, he said that even if he is old and white-haired, he will defend the border and resist foreign invaders.

Today, the Sword Dance Platform has become a place that tourists yearn to visit and is also a good place for patriotic education.

    盘山舞剑台
    金振东
    天津蓟县境内的盘山，坐落在北京正东90公里的燕山南麓，处于京、津、唐三角交汇地带。盘山由远古地壳深处酸性岩浆形成的花岗岩构成，和周围石灰岩构成的群山大不一样。它峰峦秀异，水石清奇，林木繁茂，风景优美。
    盘山名胜有三盘、五峰、八石、七十二庵，十三座宝塔。五峰之一的舞剑台更为有名。
    舞剑台在万松寺西北面。万松寺是盘山最大的庙宇。“龙山环匝，凤水萦纡”，“青山绿水，萝月松风”。原名李靖庵或卫公庵，由于唐初名将李靖曾在此居住而得名。李靖本名药师。唐太宗时，历任兵部尚书、尚书右仆射等职。先后带兵出师边塞，击败进犯唐朝的东突厥、吐谷浑，战功卓著，封卫国公。李靖在此居住其间，曾登台舞剑。
    舞剑台高三十丈，通体为花岗岩，形势险峻，有石磴可以攀登，台顶平坦。据《今古考》载：“贞观十九年，上征高丽，公以元老扈从，流览形胜。西望燕山，东眺辽海，拔剑起舞。”李靖兴之所至，高吟一曲《舞剑歌》：“陟重冈兮望四围，挈霓闪兮断虹飞，嗟嗟三军唱凯归。”云霞绚采，天风号啸，剑影凌虚，气势雄迈，豪兴飞扬，表现出一代英豪满怀壮志、威风八面的英武气概。
    台以名显，名以台扬，爱国英雄，为历代游人所仰慕。明代戚继光，在此留下了千古绝唱：“霜角一声草木衰，云头对起石门开。朔风边酒不成醉，落日归鸦无数来。但使雕戈销杀气，何妨白发老边才。勒名峰上吾谁与？故李将军舞剑台。”抒发了对李靖的仰慕之情，表示即使年迈发白，也要卫戍边陲，抵御外侮。
    今天，舞剑台成了游人向往的游览胜地，也是进行爱国主义教育的好地方。
