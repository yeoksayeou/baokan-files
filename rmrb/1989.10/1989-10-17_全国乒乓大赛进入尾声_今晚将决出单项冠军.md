The National Table Tennis Championships Enter the Final Stage
The Singles Champions Will Be Decided Tonight

BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Due to the remote location of the venue and the recent attention-grabbing competitions, the National Table Tennis Championships, which feature many world-class players, have been relatively quiet. It is said that on two days, only one ticket was sold.

The finals of the five singles events will be held tonight.

In the men's singles, several upsets have occurred. This year's World Cup champion Ma Wen-ge was eliminated in his first match by the veteran soldier Wang Guo-hui, who is also a coach. Wang Guo-hui then lost to the talented player Xiao Zhan from Sichuan. The third-place finisher in the World Table Tennis Championships, Yu Shen-tan, was defeated by the relatively unknown Beijing youngster Xiong Ke. Xiong Ke advanced to the top eight by defeating the national team player Xie Chao-jie. Other players who made it to the top eight include Chen Zhi-bin, Wang Tao, Wei Qing-guang, Lin Zhi-gang, and less-known players Lü Lin from Zhejiang and Hua Bing from Liaoning. Interestingly, five out of the top eight players are "left-handed players." The skilled player Chen Long-can did not participate in the singles due to injury.

The women's singles top eight include all national team players. They are world champion Qiao Hong, Olympic champion Chen Jing, Liu Wei, Deng Yaping, Tao Hai-dong, Chen Zi-he, Hu Xiao-xin, and Fan Jian-xin.

    全国乒乓大赛进入尾声
    今晚将决出单项冠军
    本报北京十月十六日讯  记者刘小明报道：由于赛场较为偏僻，加上近期引人注目的竞赛较多，使在石景山体育馆举行的有众多世界名将参加的全国乒乓球锦标赛显得冷冷清清。据说有两天仅售出一张门票。
    五个单项的决赛将在十七日晚进行。
    这次男子单打比赛中爆出一些冷门。今年世界杯赛冠军马文革首战即被已兼教练的解放军队老将万国辉淘汰，而万国辉随后又败在四川好手肖战拍下。世乒赛单打第三名于沈潼输给了名不见经传的北京小将熊珂，熊珂打入前八名前还力克国手谢超杰。进入男单前八名的还有陈志斌、王涛、韦晴光、林志刚等名将以及浙江吕林、辽宁华兵等知名度不高的选手。有趣的是前八名中竟有五位“左手将”。名手陈龙灿因伤没有参加单打。
    女子单打进入前八名的是清一色的国手。包括世界冠军乔红、奥运会冠军陈静，还有刘伟、邓亚萍、陶海东、陈子荷、胡小新和樊建欣。
