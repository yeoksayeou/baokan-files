Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 9th.

More than 170 business and financial leaders from 15 countries and regions, along with their spouses and assistants, were invited to participate in the Sino-Foreign Economic Cooperation Seminar held in early October by the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC). This was the first high-level international conference held in Beijing since the June 4th incident. Many of the attendees were old friends of CITIC Chairman Rong Yiren.

Seeing is Believing

"A lot of people in Japan were afraid to come to China for tourism or business after the June 4th incident in Beijing. This time, I saw with my own eyes that Beijing is stable. My wife was also initially worried, but after visiting some places in Beijing, she felt as if nothing had happened. She said she would tell her friends: 'Feel free to go to China,'" a Japanese financier said at the beginning of his speech at the seminar on October 3.

Many foreign friends who attended the seminar shared similar sentiments. A Singaporean banker said: "This time, I saw with my own eyes the stability of China's situation, rather than relying on foreign media reports. I feel that some of their reports are not objective." The chairman of the British Jardine Matheson Group, Sir John K. Swire, said: "This gathering is a happy indication that business activities in China have returned to normal." Before the meeting, he and other attendees, including the chairman of the American Bechtel Corporation, former U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, the chairman of the Japan-China Economic Association, Yoshio Kawai, and his wife, and the chairman of the Dutch Philips Company, W. A. D. J. van der Heyden, visited Tiananmen Gate to participate in the National Day celebrations, where they were received by Chairman Deng Xiaoping.

Open and Honest Dialogue

Open and honest dialogue was a hallmark of this seminar. Whether in formal speeches or private conversations, foreign friends openly expressed their concerns about continuing investments and economic and technological exchanges with China:

"Will China's current policies continue? Will government agencies continue to support or hinder the operations of joint ventures?"

"Will China's investment environment continue to allow foreign companies to make profits? Will it still be meaningful to continue investing?"

"We want to lend money to China. Some people think this is the best time; others think waiting for a better time would be better. What do you think?"

"China is now emphasizing centralized power and strengthening the planned economy. We also recognize that market forces are like a bird in a cage in a socialist economy. Will this bird starve and suffocate? Will our investments encounter difficulties?"

Businesspeople and financiers are practical. Their questions are understandable.

Open and honest dialogue, mutual understanding, and mutual trust are the keys to successful cooperation.

During meetings with Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party, Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, and at the seminar at the Great Wall Hotel and the elegant evening event at the Prince Gong Mansion, Chinese officials frankly and amicably answered these questions, explaining our policies and attitudes.

Our Policy Cards

The Party and state leaders said:

"China's door is open to the world, and China will not close it on its own."

"China's cooperation with the outside world has always been mutually beneficial."

"Neither side can do a one-time deal. Now is the best time to invest."

"First, understanding; second, trust; third, long-term considerations; fourth, don't be afraid that foreigners will benefit more than we do. We often tell our officials this."

This is the bottom line of our policy. Chinese leaders were so frank in revealing our stance face-to-face, and many foreign friends smiled, expressing satisfaction.

What about the "caged bird"?

Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission Gan Ziyu provided a good explanation. He said that we are still pursuing the policy of combining planned economy with market regulation. We will not return to the old path of excessive concentration of power and rigid economic mechanisms. When supply and demand conflicts ease, market regulation can be more active; when supply and demand conflicts are tense, we need to emphasize concentration and macro-control, but only to an appropriate extent, which will not affect reform and opening up. Foreign friends also do not want to invest in businesses that are already too large and have limited prospects."

Thus, the market regulation bird will not suffocate in the cage of socialist planned economy.

The issue of foreign exchange balance had once puzzled some joint ventures. Tang Qiaoyao, Director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, told foreign friends that an initial foreign exchange adjustment market has taken shape in China. Last year, the national foreign exchange adjustment transaction volume reached 626 million yuan. Initially, it was only between state-owned and collective enterprises, but last year it expanded to foreign-invested enterprises. This has played a positive role in the foreign exchange balance of foreign-invested enterprises.

"Reform and opening up have been clearly written into our constitution, with the highest legal authority and the greatest stability." Deputy Director of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring Gao Shangquan said that this basic policy recognized by the constitution will not change and will be implemented even better.

True Friends

The British Jardine Matheson Group and the German Krupp Company have maintained relations with us since the founding of New China. Their representatives at the seminar expressed their goodwill to strengthen economic cooperation with China. The chairman of the American Friendship Group, Shen Jianbai, who participated in the founding meeting of CITIC 10 years ago, suggested as an old friend: "China has spent a lot of foreign exchange importing cars, but only a small amount of money developing its own automobile industry. In developing the automobile industry, it tends to focus on main components rather than the parts industry. However, the United States and Japan are very focused on developing automobile parts companies." He humorously said: "It seems that China needs more unsung heroes. I am sincerely discussing this issue."

As I write this, I can't help but recall the words of former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the reception for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China held by the Consul General of China in New York: "True friends should stand together especially in complex times." Yes, adversity reveals true friends. With true friends, the tide of Sino-foreign economic cooperation will continue to surge forward.

### 合作、理解、信任之桥——中外经济合作研讨会侧记

    合作、理解、信任之桥
    ——中外经济合作研讨会侧记
    本报记者　计泓赓
    来自世界15个国家和地区的知名企业界、金融界人士，连同他们的夫人、助手共170多人，应邀参加了10月初由中信公司举办的中外经济合作研讨会。这是“6·4”风波后在北京开的一次高层次的国际性会议。他们中间的许多人是中信董事长荣毅仁的老朋友了。
    百闻不如一见
    “北京6·4事件后，日本很多人怕来中国观光、做生意。这次我亲眼见到北京是安定的。我夫人原来也曾很不放心，这次她到北京一些地方看了看，感到好像没有发生过什么事情似的。她说回去后将对朋友们说：放心去中国吧。”日本一位金融家10月3日在研讨会大会发言时一开头就这样说。
    不少参加研讨会的外国朋友对此都有同感。新加坡一位银行家说：这次我亲眼看到了中国局势的稳定，而不是通过外国舆论界来了解。我感到他们有些报道不够客观。英国太古集团董事长施雅迪说：“这次聚会可喜地表明，现在中国商业活动已经正常了。”会议前夕，他和与会的美国环球联合公司董事长、美国前国务卿黑格，日中经济协会会长河合良一及夫人，荷兰菲利浦公司董事长戴克，还登上天安门城楼参加国庆晚会，邓小平主席会见了他们。
    坦诚相见，有啥说啥
    坦诚相见，有啥说啥，是这次研讨会的特点。无论是会上发言，还是私下交谈，外国朋友毫不隐讳地对继续来华投资和进行经济技术交流，提出了若干疑虑：
    “中国现行政策是否将继续下去？政府机构将继续帮助还是阻碍合资企业的经营？”
    “今后中国的投资环境，是否继续可以让外国公司赚到钱，继续投资是否还有意义？”
    “我们想借钱给中国，有人认为现在是最好时机；有人却认为，等一等时机将更好。你们认为如何？”
    “中国现在强调权力集中和加强计划经济。我们也认识到在社会主义经济中，市场力量是一只笼中鸟。这只鸟会被饿死和窒息吗？我们投资会遇到麻烦吗？”
    企业家和金融家是务实的。他们提出这些问题是可以理解的。
    坦诚相见，互相增进理解，才能互相信任。
    在江泽民总书记同他们的会见中，在李鹏总理和他们的会见中，在长城饭店的研讨会上，在典雅的恭王府的晚会交谈中，中方人士坦率而又友好地回答了这些问题，阐述了我们的政策和态度。
    我们政策的底牌
    党和国家领导人说：
    “中国的大门是向世界各国开放的，中国不会自己把大门关上。”
    “中国对外合作从来是互惠互利的。”
    “双方都不能做一锤子买卖，现在就是投资的最好时机。”
    “第一是理解，第二是信任，第三要有长期考虑，第四不要怕外国人得利比我们多。我们经常向干部这样说。”
    这就是我们政策的底牌。中国领导人如此坦率地面对面地交了底，不少外国朋友面露笑容，表示满意。
    那么，“笼中鸟”会不会饿死和窒息呢？
    国家计委副主任甘子玉作了很好的阐述。他说，我们仍是推行计划经济和市场调节相结合的方针。决不会回到过去权力集中过多、经济机制运行僵化的老路上去。当供需矛盾缓和时，市场调节可以活跃一些；当供需矛盾紧张时，就要强调集中和宏观调控，但也只是适当的集中和适当的加强，并不影响改革开放。外国朋友也并不乐意把资金投向规模已经过大、发展前途有限的事业。”
    可见，在社会主义计划经济的笼子里飞，市场调节这只鸟儿是不会窒息的。
    外汇平衡问题，一度曾使某些合资企业感到困惑。国家外汇管理局局长唐赓尧告诉外国朋友，一个初具规模的外汇调剂市场已在我国形成。去年全国外汇调剂成交额达62.6亿元。开初只是在国营、集体企业之间调剂，去年已扩大到外商投资企业。这对外商投资企业的外汇平衡，起到了积极作用。
    “改革开放已明确地写进了我国的宪法，具有最高的法律效力和最大的稳定性。”国家体改委副主任高尚全说，宪法所确认的这个基本国策不仅不会改变，而且还要搞得更好。
    真正的朋友
    与会的英国太古集团和联邦德国克虏伯公司，从新中国成立之初就一直与我们交往。他们的代表在研讨会上都表示了要与中国加强经济合作的良好愿望。10年前就参加过中信公司成立会的美国友升集团董事长沈坚白，以一个老朋友的身份建议：中国过去花了大量外汇进口汽车，而只花少量的钱发展自己的汽车工业。在发展汽车工业上，又倾向于搞主件，而不注意配件工业。可美国、日本都很着力发展汽车的零部件公司。他幽默地说：“看来中国需要更多的无名英雄，我是出于至诚来谈这个问题的。”
    写到这里，我不由得想起美国前国务卿基辛格在我驻纽约总领事举行的建国40周年招待会上讲的话：“真正的朋友尤其应该在复杂时期站在一起。”是的，疾风知劲草，患难识真交。有了真正的朋友，中外经济合作的潮流将永远奔腾向前。
