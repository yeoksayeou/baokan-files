Ascending the Weiyuan Tower

It is already the height of autumn. Accompanied by a friend, I ascended the Weiyuan Tower in the north of Quanzhou City (anciently known as the North Tower). Upon first ascending the tower, my friend almost caressed every stone wall, red railing, painted door, and carved window. Then he tightly embraced the round pillar, leaning his head against it for a long time. I deeply understood this profound emotion, this ardent embrace, and couldn't help but let out a long sigh. Oh, Weiyuan Tower, Weiyuan Tower, how many times have you been called out in my dreams...

I remember five years ago, it was also autumn. Due to a trip to Hubei for a report, I had the opportunity to ascend the Yellow Crane Tower in the south of Wuchang (anciently known as the South Tower). At that time, the Yellow Crane Tower had just been restored and was brand new, with flying eaves and tiered pavilions, ancient and magnificent. Ascending this tower, one could see the endless Yangtze River and the magnificent Yangtze River Bridge, feeling a sense of rich historical connotation and a new era transcending time and space.

Seeing the prosperity of Wuchang and the renewal of the Yellow Crane Tower in the south, I couldn't help but think of my hometown Quanzhou and the North Tower, Weiyuan. I couldn't help but call out repeatedly: When will the Weiyuan Tower see the light of day again (at that time, the Weiyuan Tower had long been destroyed)?

As far as I know, the South Tower in Wuchang and the North Tower in Quanzhou are almost equally ancient, both being famous landmarks from the Tang Dynasty. The South Tower has a record by Yu Xin, which was famous at the time; the North Tower has a record by Ouyang Zhan, which was also very famous. However, the South Tower has been sung and praised by famous poets and great writers throughout the ages, maintaining its fame for a long time. The North Tower, however, has undergone several cycles of prosperity and decline. By the end of the Yuan Dynasty, it was rebuilt and named Weiyuan, due to the prosperity of the ancient port of Chitong in Quanzhou and the bustling scene of the ten continents. At that time, it was the city's landmark, and many foreign navigators' travelogues recorded it. However, it gradually became obscure along with the decline of Quanzhou Port. Compared to the South Tower, the North Tower, although not as revered, also had significant importance in overseas communication. No wonder, after liberation, Quanzhou's Overseas Communication Museum was set up in the Weiyuan Tower. Unfortunately, during the "Cultural Revolution," a certain city revolutionary committee director, in a frenzy of madness, ordered its demolition to build a square. This is truly a heart-wrenching memory for the people of Quanzhou. Not only my friend and I, but almost all the people of Quanzhou are eager for the reconstruction of the Weiyuan Tower, truly calling out for it countless times!

Finally, the Weiyuan Tower was rebuilt and completed this February. This joy, this cherished feeling, is born out of longing and deep affection. No wonder my friend, upon first ascending the tower, showed such genuine emotions.

The new tower is even more magnificent and imposing than the old one, with double eaves, ornate pillars, painted beams, and carved rafters. The upturned ridges and winged pavilions, with fir beams, tiled roofs, white stone walls, and red brick floors, are both grand and elegant, rich in local architectural features. According to my friend, the reconstruction of this tower was not easy, with a total investment of 1.1 million yuan, of which 500,000 yuan was donated by overseas Chinese, and many other funds were donated by the citizens. Even primary schools initiated the "Add Bricks and Tiles for the Construction of the Weiyuan Tower" activity, with small donations of five cents and one jiao accumulating to over ten thousand yuan. This alone shows the people of Quanzhou's "love for the famous city" with their lively and jumping filial hearts, showing the affection of "thinking of you deeply, worrying for you." It is worth mentioning that, before the "Cultural Revolution," an old mayor and old overseas Chinese, despite his advanced age, did not hesitate to work hard and tirelessly for the restoration of famous city landmarks and cultural development, and for the reconstruction of the Weiyuan Tower. From the collection of funds to the large-scale construction, his efforts were evident. Compared to the "fool" during the "Cultural Revolution," the contrast is striking, and the criticism is profound!

Ascending the Weiyuan Tower on an autumn day to gaze into the distance. Standing on the highest point of the Weiyuan Tower, looking back at the famous city of Quanzhou, all the scenery is within sight. To the west, the national key cultural relic protection unit, the Kaiyuan Temple's Hall of a Hundred Pillars, seems to be right in front of you, with the Song Dynasty's twin stone pagodas towering above. Below, there is the Song Dynasty Ancient Ship Exhibition Hall, which was unearthed from the Houzhu Sea Port. To the east, you can see the earliest existing Esuhaibai Mosque in China and the holy tomb of Islam, seemingly within reach. To the north, there is the national key scenic spot, Qingyuan Mountain, where human and natural landscapes are both abundant, like the jade screen of the famous city of Quanzhou. To the south, you can see the ancient port of Chitong in Quanzhou Bay, with the vast East China Sea and numerous masts.

Mr. Chen Cunguang of Huaqiao University once wrote a poem for the Weiyuan Tower, which reads: "Looking north to the peaks of Quanzhou, looking south to the vast East China Sea, the ten continents once hosted guests from the Western Regions, and the thousand-year-old docks still remain. The scenery is still as it was in the Tang and Song dynasties, and the masts are still as they were in the Chitong era. The waves are strange, the clouds are red, and the dragons and snakes compete, with an ancient and new posture to behold." If a great poet were to come here, they would also sigh with "the scenery before my eyes is indescribable," creating another shared and updated story between the South and North Towers.

    登威远楼
    吴瑞骋
    已是秋高时节，偕友人登泉州城北的威远楼（古称北楼）。乍登楼，友人几乎遍抚石壁、朱栏、漆门、雕窗……而后又紧搂着圆柱，侧头偎依良久。我深知这种情感的深沉，这种拥抱的热切，不由得也长长叹息。噢，威远楼、威远楼，曾几回梦里呼唤你……
    记得五年前，也是秋日，因到湖北易地采访，得以登上武昌城南的黄鹤楼（古称南楼），那时黄鹤楼刚复修竣工，焕然一新，飞檐重阁，古朴奇伟，登斯楼，纵眼无穷长江和雄伟的长江大桥，有一种悠久历史内涵丰富感和跨越时空的崭新时代感。
    看武昌重镇的繁荣，南楼黄鹤的更新，不由得不想起故乡泉州和泉州的北楼威远，不由得不发出声声呼唤：威远楼何时重见天日（那时威远楼早已乌有）？
    据我所知，武昌南楼和泉州北楼几乎同样古老，都是唐代名胜。武昌南楼庾信作记，名重一时；泉州北楼欧阳詹作记，也曾大噪其名。然而南楼经历代名诗人、大文豪不断吟咏渲染，盛名经久不衰。而泉州北楼几经兴废，至元末重建而命名威远，因泉州古刺桐港的鼎盛、市井十洲人的盛况而威名远扬，那时，它是这座名城的城标，不少国外航海旅行家的游记有它的记载。然而，它还是随着泉州港的衰落而逐渐默默无闻。比较起来，北楼虽不如南楼令人景仰，却也有海外交通的重要意义所在。无怪乎解放后，泉州的海外交通馆就设在威远楼上。不幸的是，在“文革”那一场愚不可及的狂热中，有位愚不可及的市革委会主任为建广场竟下令把它拆除，这在泉州人的记忆中，实在是痛心疾首的。何止友人及我，几乎所有泉州人都盼望复建威远楼，当真是千呼万唤哩！
    终于，威远楼于今年2月重建落成了。这份欢喜，这份顾惜之情，是盼之切、爱之极而生的，难怪友人乍登楼便有这番真情的流露。
    新楼比旧楼还觉高大，还觉魁伟，重檐绮柱，画栋雕梁，翘脊翼亭，杉木为梁，瓦筒为屋，白石为墙，红砖铺地，壮丽伟岸中更增古朴典雅，富有地方建筑特色。据友人谈及，此楼重建不易，总投资达110万元，其中有50万元为海外侨胞所捐，还有不少款项是市民踊跃捐献的。单小学发起“为建威远楼添砖加瓦”活动，五分、一角地积少成多，涓涓汇聚竟也捐集万元以上。仅此足见泉州人“我爱名城”的那一颗颗鲜活跳跃的赤子之心，足见那一缕缕“为你相思切、为你心憔悴”的情愫。值得一提的是，“文革”前那位离休的老市长、老归侨，不顾古稀年迈，不辞劳苦艰辛，为名城古迹的复修、文化的开发，为威远楼的重建极力奔走。重建威远楼从资金汇集到大兴土木，无不渗透着他的大量心血。对照文革中那个“愚人”，反差何其鲜明，鞭笞何其深刻！
    秋日登高好望远。登上威远楼最高处驰目骋怀，回顾泉州名城，风物尽收眼底。西看则全国文物保护单位开元寺百柱大殿如在近睫，巍峨凌空的宋代双石塔下，还有后诸海港出土的宋代古船陈列馆；东眺我国现存最早的艾苏哈卜清真寺、伊斯兰教的灵山圣墓似可瞩目；北顾有国家重点风景名胜区清源山，其人文与自然景观并茂，有如泉州名城的翠翡屏风；南观泉州湾刺桐古港码头，烟波浩瀚的东海边，风樯林立。
    华侨大学陈存广先生曾诗题威远楼，诗云：“北顾泉山峰兀兀，南观东海水茫茫，十洲曾寓天方客，千载犹留舶库坊，风物宁称唐宋日，帆樯漫说刺桐章，波奇云红龙蛇竞，旷古新姿放眼望。”设若有大手笔诗人到此，也能兴“眼前有景题不得”的浩叹，岂不又创南北两楼的又一共通更新的趣事。
