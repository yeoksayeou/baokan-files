	The experts from the Marine Environment Forecasting Center of the State Oceanic Administration recently confirmed that the ice conditions in the Bohai and Yellow Seas last winter were at a level of 1.5, which is a clearly light ice year. It is predicted that the ice conditions in the Bohai and Yellow Seas this winter and next spring will be between 2.5 and 3.0 levels, similar to the average annual situation.

	The experts predict that the freezing range in the Liaodong Bay this winter will be between 75 and 85 nautical miles, with ice thickness ranging from 25 to 35 centimeters, and the maximum thickness reaching 50 centimeters; the freezing range in the Bohai Bay will be between 15 and 25 nautical miles, with ice thickness ranging from 15 to 25 centimeters, and the maximum thickness reaching 35 centimeters; the freezing range in the northern part of the Yellow Sea will be between 15 and 25 nautical miles, with ice thickness ranging from 20 to 30 centimeters, and the maximum thickness reaching 40 centimeters; the freezing range in the Laizhou Bay will be between 20 and 30 nautical miles, with ice thickness ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters, and the maximum thickness reaching 30 centimeters.

	Due to the current high activity period of solar activity, its impact on the global atmospheric circulation cannot be underestimated. The experts suggest that all forecasting units should closely cooperate and work together. The Marine Environment Forecasting Center of the State Oceanic Administration will timely supplement this trend forecast. After the onset of winter, they will also issue medium- and short-term forecasts for sea ice every ten days. Please pay attention to this information in a timely manner by all marine production departments.

　　海洋环境预报中心专家认为
　　渤黄海今冬明春冰情如常
    本报北京10月30日讯　国家海洋局海洋环境预报中心的专家最近确认：去年冬季渤、黄海冰情为1.5级，属明显轻冰年。预计今冬明春渤、黄海的冰情为2.5至3.0级，与常年平均情况相似。
    专家们预计，今年冬季辽东湾结冰范围为75至85海里，冰厚25至35厘米，最厚为50厘米；渤海湾结冰范围15至25海里，冰厚15至25厘米，最厚为35厘米；黄海北部结冰范围15至25海里，冰厚20至30厘米，最厚为40厘米；莱州湾结冰范围20至30海里，冰厚10至20厘米，最厚为30厘米。
    由于目前太阳活动正处于高峰活跃时期，它的活动对地球大气环流的影响不可低估，专家们提出：各预报单位要密切联系，通力合作。国家海洋局海洋环境预报中心将及时补充这一趋势预报。入冬以后，他们每旬还将发布海冰的中、短期预报。请海上各生产部门随时予以注意。
