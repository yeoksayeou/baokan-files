The documentary film "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought," which introduces China's three successful nuclear tests, was first publicly screened in Osaka on March 13, receiving a warm welcome from progressive individuals in Osaka.

The screening was organized by the Osaka Prefectural Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine).

Sakai Masakazu, a standing committee member of the Osaka Prefectural Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), expressed his excitement and praised the film, saying, "At a time when the United States and the Soviet Union are colluding to monopolize nuclear weapons and threaten the world's people with nuclear weapons, the success of China's nuclear tests has greatly encouraged us."

University lecturer Tetsuka Tadaomi said after watching the film, "The revolutionary Chinese people have mastered nuclear weapons, which is of great significance for defending world peace. This is a heavy blow to the United States and the Soviet Union's monopoly on nuclear weapons."

Tetsuka continued, "Mao Zedong Thought is not only the weapon of the Chinese people but also the weapon of the revolutionary people of the world."

Hosoki Miyeko, a housewife who had lived in China before liberation, enthusiastically said, "In just seventeen years since the liberation of the Chinese people, such great achievements have been made in science. This is because of the great leader Chairman Mao."

Hosoki said, "American nuclear weapons are tools of killing, but Chinese nuclear weapons are weapons for defending peace. I watched this movie and did not feel the horror of nuclear weapons. Instead, I saw the hope of completely eliminating nuclear weapons. Therefore, it is absolutely unacceptable for Japanese revisionists to follow the Soviet modern revisionist group and maliciously slander the revolutionary significance of China's nuclear weapons."

    中国的核武器是保卫世界和平的武器
    《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》纪录影片
    在大阪放映受到日本人民热烈欢迎
    新华社十四日讯　东京消息：东方通讯社报道，介绍中国三次核试验成功的中国彩色纪录影片《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》，十三日在大阪首次公开放映，受到大阪进步人士的热烈欢迎。
    这次放映是由日中友好协会（正统）大阪府总部主办的。
    日中友好协会（正统）大阪府总部常务理事坂井雅一怀着激动的心情称赞这部影片说：“正当美苏勾结垄断核武器，对世界人民进行核威胁的时候，中国核试验的成功使我们受到了极大的鼓舞。”
    大学讲师手塚唯听看了这部影片以后说：“革命的中国人民掌握了核武器，对于保卫世界和平有着极其重要的意义，这是对美苏垄断核武器的一个沉重打击。”
    手塚接着说：“毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民，也是世界革命人民的武器。”
    解放前曾经在中国生活过的家庭主妇细木美祢热情地说：“中国人民解放后仅仅十七年的时间，在科学方面就能取得如此巨大的成就，这是因为有伟大的领袖毛主席。”
    细木说：“美国的核武器是杀人的工具，可是中国的核武器是保卫和平的武器。我看了这部电影并不感到核武器的可怕，相反，我看到了彻底消灭核武器的希望。因此，日本修正主义分子追随苏联现代修正主义集团，竭力诬蔑中国核武器的革命意义，这是绝对不能允许的。”
