The war-monger Johnson will personally lead a delegation including Rusk, McNamara, and other military and political bigwigs to Guam on the 18th of this month to meet with the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, and the U.S. "ambassador" to Saigon, Lodge. He will also preside over a high-level meeting attended by senior U.S. military and political figures and the heads of the puppet regime in South Vietnam. This is Johnson's second trip outside the U.S. to personally plot the escalation of the Vietnam War since the Honolulu meeting in February last year. The White House spokesman stated that the Guam meeting will discuss the "most important military and diplomatic issues." U.S. newspapers have revealed that this meeting will decide on the "escalation" of the war in Vietnam and discuss further "strengthening military pressure" and other issues.

Johnson's personal trip to East Asia is one of the major steps taken by U.S. imperialism in recent times to intensify the Vietnam War.

Massive Troop Build-Up

Recently, U.S. imperialism has been frantically mobilizing troops and accelerating the deployment of forces to South Vietnam to further intensify the Vietnam War. According to official U.S. figures, from the end of last December to the present, the U.S. has sent 61,000 troops into South Vietnam, bringing the total number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam to a new high of 423,000. It is reported that Westmoreland will request at the Guam meeting to increase U.S. troops in Vietnam to 600,000. The U.S. has also increased troops in its military bases in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. In addition, the U.S. has requested some of its vassal states to increase their contributions of cannon fodder to the Vietnam War.

Increased Military Spending

To meet the needs of escalating the war, the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson has been continuously increasing military spending in Vietnam. Currently, the U.S. spends an average of $70 million per day on the Vietnam War. In January, Johnson wrote to Congress requesting an additional $12.2 billion to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam. This additional amount is more than double the original budget. This huge war expenditure has recently been approved by the U.S. House Appropriations Committee. The U.S. Senate emphasized that this money must ensure that U.S. troops in Vietnam have the necessary weapons for the war. Not long ago, Johnson also proposed a 1967-1968 fiscal year budget plan to expand the war and madly increase military spending. According to this plan, direct military spending in the next fiscal year, starting July 1, will reach $75.5 billion. Direct spending on the Vietnam War will be $21.9 billion, accounting for nearly one-third of direct military spending.

Active Deployment

While intensifying the "escalation" of the war, U.S. imperialism is actively conducting counter-revolutionary coordination. Over the past two months, Johnson has sent a large number of high-ranking officials to South Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Japan, and other places to actively promote its counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy and make active war preparations. Among these officials are President's Special Advisor Taylor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler, Secretary of the Air Force Brown, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Goldberg, and Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern and Pacific Affairs William Bundy. Recently, in Baguio, the Philippines, Goldberg, Bundy, and others presided over a secret meeting of envoys from 15 countries and regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.

Expanding Military Bases

To meet the needs of further expanding the war of aggression, U.S. imperialism is rapidly expanding its military bases in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. In particular, in Thailand, the U.S. has completed the Utapao Air Base in the city of Takhli, which can be used by B-52 strategic bombers. Recently, after some U.S. military leaders actively engaged in activities in Thailand, the Thanom selling-out clique agreed to allow U.S. B-52 strategic bombers to be stationed in Thailand. U.S. imperialism has dispatched a large number of warships to roam freely in the seas of Southeast Asia.

Currently, due to the treacherous activities of the Soviet revisionists, the counter-revolutionary arrogance of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam has reached an unprecedented level. However, this does not reflect its strength but rather its unprecedented weakness and desperate struggle for survival. No matter what crazy plans for escalating the war Johnson and other war-mongers make at the Guam meeting, and no matter how high they want to escalate the war, they will not intimidate the Vietnamese people and the people of various countries in Asia. The heroic Vietnamese people are giving the rampant enemy a heavy blow. The U.S. aggressors' feet are already deeply mired in the vast sea of people's war and will inevitably meet their doom.

### 捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡  美帝加紧准备进一步扩大侵越战争

    捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡
    美帝加紧准备进一步扩大侵越战争
    本报讯　据西方通讯社报道，战争贩子约翰逊将于本月十八日亲自率领腊斯克、麦克纳马拉等等大小军政头目飞往关岛，同侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰、美国驻西贡“大使”洛奇会晤，并准备亲自主持有美国军政大员和南越伪政权头目参加的高级会议。这是继去年二月檀香山会议后，约翰逊第二次离开美国亲自出马策划扩大侵越战争。美国白宫发言人声称，关岛会议将讨论“最重大的军事和外交问题”。美国报纸透露，这次会议将决定美国在越南继续战争“升级”，讨论进一步“加强军事压力”等问题。
    约翰逊亲自到远东来，这是美帝国主义一个时期以来加紧侵越战争的重大步骤之一。
    大量增兵
    最近，美帝国主义为了进一步强化侵越战争，拚命调兵遣将，加速向南越增兵。据美国官方宣布的数字，从去年十二月初到现在，美国已把六万一千名侵略军运进了南越，使侵入越南南方的美军人数达到四十二万三千人的新高峰。据透露，威斯特摩兰将在关岛会议上要求把侵越美军增至六十万。美国还向东南亚和太平洋地区的美军基地增派了驻军。此外，美国还向它的一些仆从国家提出增加侵越炮灰的要求。
      追加军费
    为了扩大战争的需要，美帝国主义头子约翰逊不断增加侵越军费。目前美国用于侵越战争的开支，达到平均每天七千万美元。约翰逊在今年一月间写信给国会，要求追拨一百二十二亿美元，用来扩大侵略越南的战争。追加的数字超过原来的预算一倍以上。这笔巨额战争费用，最近已由美国众议院拨款委员会通过。美国参议院强调，这笔钱要保证为侵越美军提供进行战争所需要的武器。不久前，约翰逊还提出了一个扩大战争和疯狂扩军的一九六七——一九六八年度预算计划。根据这个计划，在今年七月一日开始的下一财政年度内，直接军费开支将达七百五十五亿美元。直接用于侵越战争的开支为二百十九亿美元，占直接军费开支的近三分之一。
      积极部署
    美帝国主义在加紧战争“升级”的同时，加紧进行反革命串连。两个多月来，约翰逊派出了大批高级官员，到南越、泰国、菲律宾、日本等地活动，加紧推行它的反革命两手政策，并积极进行战争部署。这批人中有总统特别顾问泰勒、参谋长联席会议主席惠勒、空军部长布朗、驻联合国大使戈德堡、负责远东和太平洋事务助理国务卿威廉·邦迪等。最近，在菲律宾的碧瑶，戈德堡、邦迪等人主持了东南亚和太平洋地区十五个国家和地区使节的秘密会议。
      扩建基地
    为了适应进一步扩大侵略战争的需要，美帝国主义在东南亚和太平洋地区的军事基地正在加速扩建中。特别是在泰国，美国已在那里的梭桃邑基地建成了可供B—52型战略轰炸机使用的乌塔保机场。最近，美国的一些军事头子到泰国积极活动之后，他侬卖国集团已同意让美国B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国。美帝国主义派出的大批军舰在东南亚海面横冲直撞。
    目前由于苏修的叛卖活动，美帝国主义在越南的反革命气焰达到空前的嚣张程度。但是，这决不反映它的强大，而是反映了它空前的虚弱和垂死的挣扎。不管约翰逊等战争贩子在关岛会议上作出什么疯狂的扩大战争计划，也不管他们要把战争升到那一级，都吓不倒越南人民和亚洲各国人民。英雄的越南人民正在给猖獗的敌人迎头痛击，美国侵略者的泥足早已深陷在人民战争的汪洋大海中，绝不能逃脱灭顶之灾。
