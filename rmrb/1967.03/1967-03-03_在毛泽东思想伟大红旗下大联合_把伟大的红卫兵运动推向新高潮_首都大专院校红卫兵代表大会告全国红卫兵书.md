We are filled with immense excitement as we solemnly declare to all Red Guard comrades across the country: The Beijing Higher Education Institutions Red Guard Representatives' Congress has been born in the great storm of the "January Revolution"! The three command centers of the Beijing Red Guards have united!

Let us enthusiastically cheer for another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! Let us cheer for another great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Just as the storm of the proletarian revolutionary power seizure is sweeping the nation with the force of a mountain collapse and the power of thunder, just as this great revolutionary storm is swiftly demolishing the strongholds occupied by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, just as this great revolutionary storm is touching the souls of every individual more broadly and deeply, the proletarian revolutionaries of our capital, following the course charted by our great helmsman, have merged into a surging torrent. We are beginning to strike more fiercely against the strongholds occupied by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party! We are beginning to strike more fiercely against all old reactionary social forces and all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits! It will drown all the monsters and demons, cleanse all the filth, and sweep away all the pests!

From the day we were born, we Red Guards have solemnly declared to the world: We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. We love, believe in, worship, and are loyal to Chairman Mao without limits. Our glorious battle history has been forged along the path indicated by our great helmsman, Chairman Mao. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we fight. Therefore, we have grown and become strong in the great storms of class struggle. Now, following the instructions of our supreme commander, Chairman Mao, we are implementing the great unity of the revolution, and we will certainly achieve even more glorious victories!

Seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is the order given to us by our supreme commander, Chairman Mao. It is the great historical mission bestowed upon us by the times. It is the decisive battle that determines the victory or defeat of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards must, together with the proletarian revolutionaries across the country, bravely charge into battle!

The great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries is the course charted for us by our great helmsman. It is the inevitable requirement of social historical development. It is the urgent task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards must spare no effort to contribute to the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries.

To see if you are revolutionary or not, look at whether you can contribute to the great unity of the revolution.

Our great unity is not a chaotic mess!

Our great unity is not a principle-less peaceful coexistence!

The purpose of our great unity is to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party!

The principle foundation of our great unity is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Whether you welcome it or not, whether you implement it or not, this great unity is a comprehensive test of your worldview and mass perspective. If you are self-centered, you will fear and resist the great unity, and in the end, you will, consciously or unconsciously, help the enemy. If you are public-spirited, you will welcome the great unity with both hands and strive wholeheartedly for the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. If you believe that the masses are the true heroes, you will unite with more people and join more revolutionary forces to seize power together. If you think you are the greatest, you will exclude others and dominate a region.

In short, "selfishness" is the great enemy of the great unity. The enemy is at the gate, and it must be defeated! Defeat "selfishness"!

To implement true great unity, we must study "The Three Articles" as our guiding principles, grasp the transformation of our worldview, deeply examine our souls, break away from selfishness and establish public spirit, break away from the old and establish the new, and fight on two fronts—transforming the objective world and the subjective world; seize power on two battle lines—seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and seize power from the "selfishness" in our minds. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, "Go to the masses!" We must, with leadership, organization, and planning, go to the countryside in phases and batches, go to the factories, learn from the workers and peasants, unite with the workers and peasants, get ourselves covered in oil and mud, and forge ourselves into proletarian hard bones that cannot be crushed by heavy artillery and cannot be defeated by sugar-coated bullets!

Dear Red Guard comrades! Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. It is an unprecedented great revolution in human history. Let us unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, push the great Red Guard movement to a new height, and make new contributions to the new stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

Dear comrades, we sincerely hope for the early realization of the great unity of the Red Guards across the country on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, the unified organization of the Red Guards across the country will definitely be born; at that time, we will definitely more thoroughly eliminate the poison left by the counter-revolutionary revisionists in our country's youth work, and make our youth movement enter a completely new era; at that time, more revolutionary youth will definitely unite with us Red Guards, and together with us, make new contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country. The imperialists and modern revisionists' attempt to make our country undergo "peaceful evolution" will definitely be shattered. Whoever dares to take the capitalist road, we will rebel against them and seize their power! Whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought will be overthrown!

The future belongs to us! Victory belongs to us!

All Red Guards across the country, unite!

Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our most, most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao!

    在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下大联合  把伟大的红卫兵运动推向新高潮
    首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会告全国红卫兵书
    新华社二日讯　首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会告全国红卫兵书
    我们怀着万分激动的心情，庄严地向全国红卫兵战友们宣告：首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会，在伟大的“一月革命”的风暴中诞生了！首都红卫兵三个司令部的革命派联合起来了！
    让我们热烈地欢呼毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！欢呼以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    正当无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的风暴，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力席卷全国的时候，正当这大革命的风暴，在迅猛地摧毁被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所盘踞的那些顽固堡垒的时候，正当这大革命的风暴在更广泛、更深刻地触及每个人的灵魂的时候，我们首都的无产阶级革命派，按照我们伟大舵手指明的航向，汇成了一股汹涌澎湃的洪流，开始向着被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所盘踞的顽固堡垒更加猛烈地冲击了！开始向一切旧的反动的社会势力和一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯更加猛烈地冲击了！它将淹没一切牛鬼蛇神，涤荡一切污泥浊水，扫除一切害人虫！
    我们红卫兵从诞生那天起，就庄严地向全世界宣告：我们是毛主席的红卫兵，我们对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。我们光辉的战斗历程，是沿着我们伟大舵手毛主席指引的方向走过来的。毛主席指到哪里，我们斗争到哪里，所以我们在阶级斗争的大风大浪里成长壮大了。现在我们又按最高统帅毛主席的指示，实行革命的大联合，我们也就必将取得更加辉煌的胜利！
    向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，这是我们最高统帅毛主席向我们下达的命令，是时代赋予我们的伟大历史使命，是决定无产阶级文化大革命胜败的关键之战，红卫兵必须和全国无产阶级革命派一道英勇地冲锋陷阵！
    无产阶级革命派大联合，这是我们伟大舵手指给我们的航向，是社会历史发展的必然要求，是无产阶级文化大革命的当务之急。红卫兵必须全力以赴，为促成无产阶级革命派的大联合作出新的贡献。
    看你革命不革命，要看你能不能为革命的大联合出力。
    我们的大联合，绝不是乌七八糟的大杂烩！
    我们的大联合，绝不是无原则的和平共处！
    我们大联合的目的是为着夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权！
    我们大联合的原则基础是战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    欢迎不欢迎，实行不实行这样的大联合，是对我们每个人的世界观和群众观点的总检验。你是“私”字当头，就害怕大联合、抵制大联合，结果在客观上你就总会或多或少、自觉不自觉地帮敌人的忙；你是“公”字当头，就会举双手欢迎大联合，就会尽心竭力地为无产阶级革命派的大联合而奋斗。你相信群众是真正的英雄，你就会更广泛地团结群众，联合更多的革命派一起夺权；你要是“老子天下第一”，就会排斥别人，独霸一方。
    总之一句话，“私”字是大联合的大敌。大敌当前，必须打倒！打倒“私”字！
    要实行真正的大联合，就必须把“老三篇”当做座右铭来学，狠抓世界观的改造，狠触自己的灵魂，破私立公，破旧立新，在两个战场上搏斗——改造客观世界、改造主观世界；在两条火线上夺权——夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权、夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，就必须响应毛主席的伟大号召，“到群众里面去”！我们要有领导、有组织、有计划、分期分批地到农村去，到工厂去，向工农学习，与工农相结合，沾一身油污，滚一身泥巴，将自己锻炼成重炮摧不垮，糖弹打不倒的无产阶级硬骨头！
    亲爱的红卫兵战友们！我们的无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下的大革命，是人类历史上空前未有的大革命。让我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下联合起来，把伟大的红卫兵运动推向一个新高潮，使它为我国无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段立下新功劳。
    亲爱的战友们，我们真诚地希望尽快地实现全国红卫兵在毛泽东思想基础上的大联合。到那时，红卫兵全国统一性的组织一定会诞生；到那时，我们一定会更加彻底地扫除反革命修正主义分子过去在我国青年工作中的流毒，使我国青年运动跨进一个全新的时代；到那时，一定会有更多的革命青年和我们红卫兵团结在一起，和我们一道为我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设立下新的功绩。帝国主义、现代修正主义妄图使我国“和平演变”的幻想一定会破灭，谁敢走资本主义道路，我们就造谁的反、夺谁的权！谁敢反对毛泽东思想就打倒谁！
    未来属于我们！胜利属于我们！
    全国红卫兵联合起来！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会
