The revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai's suburban rural areas is surging forward with tremendous momentum. The tide of agricultural production is rolling ahead vigorously. The New China News Agency correspondent comments on the excellent situation of grasping revolution and promoting production in Shanghai's suburban rural areas.

More than three million revolutionary peasants in Shanghai's suburban rural areas are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, riding the momentum of the great "January Revolution," and striding forward with high spirits in the struggle to achieve a great alliance of revolutionary factions and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Currently, they are resolutely responding to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," and are firmly implementing the instructions in the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to all peasants, poor and lower-middle peasants, and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes across the country. With a magnificent attitude as masters of the state, they are striving with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm and tenacious will to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Looking at Shanghai's suburban rural areas, everywhere is a scene of vigorous vitality. Revolutionary slogans are everywhere, and red flags are flying high. Groups of peasants holding red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wearing red armbands are either holding meetings to expose and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road or holding rallies to launch a new high tide of spring plowing. In the fields of this famous high-yield agricultural area, the wheat seedlings are robust, and the rapeseed is lush green. The broad masses of commune members are busy with field management centered on fertilization, as well as land leveling, fertilizer accumulation, and fertilizer production and other preparations for spring plowing. A new high tide of revolution and production is surging forward, with an unprecedented scale, momentum, and speed.

The great alliance of revolutionary factions lays a solid foundation for spring plowing production.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." The revolutionary peasants in Shanghai's suburban rural areas, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, have established revolutionary organizations at the municipal, county, commune, and production brigade levels with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, forming a mighty cultural revolution army that is marching forward to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and are entrenched in the old Shanghai Municipal Committee, county committees, and commune party committees. They have seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers held by these harmful elements and firmly grasped the reins of power in their own hands.

Currently, the characteristics of the struggle by the revolutionary factions in Shanghai's suburban rural areas to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are: the revolutionary factions are achieving a broader great alliance. This is manifested in:

First, various revolutionary faction organizations have actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, especially studying the brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," gradually overcoming extremist democratism, liberalism, sectarianism, guildism, factionalism, and other erroneous ideological tendencies within the revolutionary factions, resolutely overthrowing the "self" in their own minds, and establishing the "public" spirit, providing a more solid ideological foundation for the development and consolidation of the great alliance of revolutionary factions.

Second, under the education and inspiration of Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, more and more cadres at the county, commune, and production brigade levels have come forward to "come out," and they are joining the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to rebel against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Many have already been absorbed into the revolutionary faction organizations. Some counties have implemented the "three-in-one combination" of leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, local military leaders, and revolutionary leading cadres to jointly seize power.

Third, the workers' movement and students' movement are further combined with the peasants' movement. Mao Zedong Thought is further arming the broad masses of peasants, whose class consciousness and ideological level have reached an unprecedented height, their fighting spirit is more ardent, their fighting strategies are more perfect, their organizations are more complete, and their discipline is more strict.

On the other hand, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are more isolated and weaker. Their previous "white terror" against revolutionary peasants and the reactionary tricks of spreading the counter-revolutionary economic wind have been thoroughly defeated by the revolutionary peasants. These villains, with their dying ambitions, still want to make a last stand, but in the face of the revolutionary torrent of the great alliance and unity of the rural revolutionary factions, and under the pursuit of the revolutionary peasants, their reactionary fortresses have collapsed, their momentum is gone, and their defeat is inevitable.

The development and strengthening of the great alliance of revolutionary factions in Shanghai's suburban areas mark that the cultural revolution of the proletariat in Shanghai's suburban areas has entered a new stage and reached a new level. This has laid a solid political and ideological foundation for the peasants in Shanghai's suburban areas to fire the first shot of spring plowing production this year.

Establishing a joint command organization for production provides good conditions for spring plowing.

The revolutionary peasants in Shanghai's suburban areas have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production" in the cultural revolution of the proletariat, acting as pioneers in revolution and models in production.

In the stormy class struggle, the county committees and commune party committees controlled by the old Shanghai Municipal Committee have been thoroughly overthrown by the revolutionary masses. Some production management organizations that had hindered the socialist enthusiasm of the peasant masses and were not adapted to the development of socialist productive forces have been reformed by the revolutionary masses, and some production management organizations are in a state of paralysis. However, the revolutionary peasants are bold and capable. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." The revolutionary peasants say well: Since we dare to seize power, we can also hold power well and use power well. Let those old masters of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road see our abilities!

The revolutionary peasants in Shanghai's suburban areas have learned to achieve a great alliance of revolutionary factions in the struggle, and they have also achieved a great alliance in production. Under the strong support and help of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, they have established a city-wide joint organization to command agricultural production. Once established, this organization has shown its strong vitality, playing a role in organizing and leading agricultural production in Shanghai's suburban areas, greatly promoting and advancing the development of agricultural production, and playing a powerful role in strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and consolidating local power.

Now, in most counties, communes, and production brigades in Shanghai's suburban areas, corresponding organizations composed of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have been established. The production command organizations at the county, commune, and brigade levels are connected with the city's organizations, thus basically combining the organizational and leadership work of agricultural production in Shanghai's suburban areas from top to bottom and from bottom to top, ensuring that the spring production and various tasks in the suburban areas are carried out smoothly.

Due to the implementation of the great alliance in production, the manpower, material resources, and financial resources needed for spring production at the municipal, county, commune, and production brigade levels have been relatively well coordinated and solved. The revolutionary factions of the supply and marketing, credit, handicraft, commercial, and transportation departments have also taken swift action from various fronts and aspects to support agricultural production, providing relatively good conditions for spring plowing.

We must achieve double victories in revolution and production.

"The cultural revolution of the proletariat is to make people's thoughts revolutionary, so that all work can be done better, faster, more, and more economically." The broad revolutionary peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai's suburban areas, while participating in the cultural revolution of the proletariat and transforming the objective world, pay great attention to actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and seriously transforming the subjective world. Now, the broad revolutionary peasants and revolutionary cadres are putting the sky-high enthusiasm released in the cultural revolution of the proletariat into production and work. As our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Never before have we seen the people so spirited, so full of fighting spirit, and so full of vigor."

Currently, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in Shanghai's suburban areas have taken swift action, jointly shouldering the two burdens of revolution and production, and actively grasping the current spring plowing production while continuing to do a good job in the cultural revolution. They say, the Central Committee has written a letter to us, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, revolution must be carried out, production must be done, and we must achieve double victories in revolution and production. Of course, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who insist on their reactionary stance still want to sabotage production and destroy the collective economy of the people's communes. However, the broad revolutionary peasants and revolutionary cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never allow the enemy's plots to succeed. They understand that doing a good job in this year's agricultural production is not only to fight a beautiful battle in agricultural production but more importantly to fight a beautiful battle politically. Whether this battle can be won or not is related to the victory of the cultural revolution of the proletariat and whether our people can make greater contributions to the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. This is a sharp political struggle, a serious class struggle. The broad revolutionary peasants and revolutionary cadres have more enthusiasm and stronger fighting spirit. The revolutionary peasants and revolutionary cadres of Guangming Production Brigade, Huamu Commune, Chuansha County have been full of fighting spirit and vigor since before and after the Spring Festival, actively engaging in production labor such as ditching and draining water in wheat fields and rapeseed fields, fertilizing, and accumulating fertilizer, and timely sowing spring crops to eliminate fallow land. The revolutionary peasants and revolutionary cadres of Zhao Xiang Commune, Qingpu County have jointly carried out current field management while accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, plowing and turning over seedling fields and fallow land, and carrying out the construction of medium and small-sized water conservancy projects and other spring plowing preparations. The work of fattening draft animals, repairing and adding farm tools, and drying seeds has also been implemented. Each production team has also carried out diversified operations with pig raising as the main focus. Such units as Guangming Brigade and Zhao Xiang Commune are currently emerging in large numbers in Shanghai's suburban areas. This fully shows that the overall situation of agricultural production in the suburban areas is excellent, the future is bright, and as long as we continue to work hard, the bumper harvest of agricultural production this year is in sight.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The army advances, and production increases by an inch." Currently, the peasant revolutionary movement in Shanghai is in full swing. It can be foreseen that with the deepening development of the cultural revolution of the proletariat, Shanghai's suburban rural areas will present an even more magnificent and grand new high tide of agricultural production. Let us loudly praise and enthusiastically sing its arrival.

Long live the great revolutionary peasant movement!

Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    革命农民运动汹涌澎湃  农业生产高潮滚滚向前
    新华社记者评述上海郊区农村抓革命促生产大好形势
    上海郊区农村三百多万革命农民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘伟大“一月革命”的东风，在实行革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，昂首阔步，高歌猛进。当前，他们正在坚决地响应伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚决贯彻中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信中的指示，以国家主人翁的豪迈姿态，用空前高昂的革命干劲和顽强毅力，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    喜看上海郊区农村，到处是一派朝气蓬勃的景象，革命标语如林，风展红旗如画。一批批手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》、臂戴革命造反红袖章的农民，或是集会揭发、批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，或是举行掀起春耕生产新高潮的誓师大会。在这个著名的农业高产区的田野里，麦苗茁壮，油菜碧绿，广大社员正在紧张地进行以追肥为中心的田间管理和平整土地、积肥、造肥等春耕生产准备工作。一个革命和生产的新高潮，正在蓬勃发展，其规模之大，来势之猛，速度之快，都是史无前例的。
    革命派大联合为春耕生产奠定可靠的基础
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”上海郊区农村的革命农民遵照毛主席这一伟大教导，以广大贫下中农为主体，建立了市、县、公社、生产大队各级革命组织，汇成一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，向盘踞在旧上海市委、县委、公社党委内的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了猛烈攻击。把这一小撮害人虫所把持的党、政、财、文大权夺回，把印把子牢牢地掌握在革命派手里。
    目前，上海郊区农村革命派大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的特点是：革命派更广泛地实现大联合。这表现在：
    一、各革命派组织在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，特别是学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作，逐步克服了革命派内部存在的极端民主化、自由主义、风头主义、宗派主义、行会主义、山头主义，以及其他错误思想倾向，坚决打倒自己头脑里的“私”字，树立“公”字，为革命派大联合的发展和巩固，提供了更坚实的思想基础。
    二、在毛主席的干部政策的教育和感召下，县、公社、生产大队各级的广大革命干部，已有越来越多的人站出来“亮相”，他们同广大贫下中农一起造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，有许多人已经被吸收到革命派组织中来。有些县已经实行了革命群众组织的负责人、当地驻军负责人和革命领导干部“三结合”联合夺权。
    三、工人运动、学生运动同农民运动进一步结合起来。毛泽东思想进一步武装广大农民，他们的阶级觉悟和思想水平空前提高，斗志更旺，斗争策略更加完善，组织更加健全，纪律更为严明。
    另一方面，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，更加孤立，更加虚弱了。他们在前一时期对革命农民实行“白色恐怖”，以及大刮反革命经济主义妖风等反动伎俩，都被革命农民彻底击败。这些坏家伙野心不死，仍想负隅顽抗，但是，在农村革命派大联合、大团结的革命洪流面前，在革命农民的乘胜追击下，他们的反动堡垒已经土崩瓦解，大势已去，败局已定了。
    上海郊区革命派大联合的发展和加强，标志着上海郊区农村无产阶级文化大革命进入到一个新阶段，达到了一个新水平。这就为上海郊区农民打响今年春耕生产第一炮，奠定了可靠的政治基础和思想基础。
    建立指挥生产联合机构为春耕提供好条件
    上海郊区的革命农民在无产阶级文化大革命中，一直遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的教导，在革命中当闯将，在生产中当模范。
    在急风暴雨般的阶级斗争中，旧上海市委所控制的那些烂掉了的某些县委、公社党委，已被革命群众彻底推翻。一些原来阻碍农民群众社会主义积极性、不适应社会主义生产力发展的生产管理机构，已被革命群众加以改造，个别生产管理机构，也处于瘫痪状态。但是，革命农民是有胆量、有能力的。他们按照毛主席的教导：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”革命农民说得好：我们既然敢夺权，我们就能掌好权、用好权。让那些党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的老爷们看看我们的能耐吧！
    上海郊区革命农民在斗争中学会了革命派大联合，他们在生产中也来了个大联合。他们在人民解放军驻沪部队的大力支持和帮助下，建立了全市性的指挥农业生产的联合机构。这个组织一建立，就显示了它的强大生命力，起着组织、领导上海郊区农业生产的作用，大大地推动、促进了农业生产的发展，并对加强工农联盟和巩固地方政权发挥了有力的作用。
    现在，上海郊区农村绝大多数的县、公社、生产大队都建立了由革命群众和革命干部组成的相应的机构。各县、社、队指挥生产的机构，同市里的机构相联系，这就基本上把上海郊区农业生产的组织、领导工作，从上到下，自下而上地结合起来，从而，保证了郊区春季生产和各项工作有条不紊地顺利进行。
    由于在生产上实行大联合，当前从市、县、公社到生产大队，春季生产所需的人力、物力、财力已经较好地调配解决。供销、信用、手工业、商业、交通运输等有关部门的革命派也已火速行动起来，从各条战线、各个方面来支援农业生产，为春耕生产提供了较好的条件。
    一定要夺取革命和生产的双胜利
    “无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”上海郊区农村的广大革命农民和革命干部，在参加无产阶级文化大革命，改造客观世界的同时，十分注意活学活用毛主席著作，认真改造主观世界。现在，广大革命农民和革命干部正在把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产和工作中去。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”
    目前，上海郊区广大贫下中农和各级革命干部，已迅速行动起来，共同挑起革命和生产两副担子，在继续搞好文化革命的基础上，积极抓好当前的春耕生产。他们说，党中央给我们写了信，我们坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，革命要搞，生产要干，一定夺取革命和生产的双胜利。当然，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子还是妄想破坏生产，搞垮人民公社的集体经济，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命农民和革命干部决不允许阶级敌人的阴谋得逞。他们懂得，搞好今年的农业生产，不仅仅是为了在农业生产上打一个漂亮仗，更重要的是为了在政治上打一个漂亮仗。能不能打胜这一仗，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，关系到我国人民能否对世界人民的革命斗争作出更大的贡献。这是一场尖锐的政治斗争，是一场严重的阶级斗争。广大革命农民和革命干部干劲更大，斗志更强。川沙县花木公社光明生产大队的广大革命农民和革命干部，早在春节前后就斗志昂扬，意气风发地投入了麦田、油菜的开沟排水，追肥、积肥等生产劳动，及时地种上了春播作物，消灭了白地。青浦县赵巷公社的革命农民和革命干部一起，在搞好当前田间管理的同时，开展了大积肥料，耕翻秧田、白田，以及兴修中小型水利等春季备耕工作。耕牛复膘，农具修添，种子清晒等工作也已落实。各生产队还开展了以养猪为主的多种经营。象光明大队、赵巷公社这样的单位，目前在上海郊区农村正在大量涌现。这充分说明，整个郊区农业生产的形势是大好的，前途是光明的，只要继续努力，今年农业生产的丰收是指日可期的。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“军队向前进，生产长一寸”。当前，上海的农民革命运动方兴未艾。可以预见，随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，上海郊区农村将会出现一个气势更加雄伟，规模更加壮阔的农业生产新高潮。让我们高声赞美、热情歌颂它的到来吧。
    伟大的革命农民运动胜利万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
