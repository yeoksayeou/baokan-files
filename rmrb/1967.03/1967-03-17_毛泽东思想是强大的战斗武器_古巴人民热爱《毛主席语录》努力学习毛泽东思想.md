Mao Zedong Thought is a Powerful Weapon of Struggle
The Cuban People Love the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Strive to Study Mao Zedong Thought

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 16th, Havana: Cuban friends love the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," praise it as the "most precious book," and express their determination to study it diligently.

Always Keep the Revolutionary Book by Your Side

A Cuban worker who has an infinite love for Chairman Mao always asks Chinese comrades whenever he meets them, "Has the Spanish version of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' arrived? When can I get this red treasure book?"

What if the Spanish version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is not available for the time being? This Cuban worker came up with a solution: every time he meets Chinese comrades, he asks them to take out the Chinese version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and translate a passage for him orally. He listens and memorizes it with great concentration, which has almost become an indispensable lesson whenever he meets Chinese comrades.

One day, a Chinese comrade gave him a Spanish version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The Cuban worker excitedly shook hands with the Chinese comrade. He said excitedly, "Great! Great! I finally got the treasure book I have been waiting for so long. I will always keep the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' in my pocket and study this treasure book at any time."

Determined to Study Mao Zedong Thought Well

A few Chinese comrades met an old Cuban farmer while traveling in a mountainous area in Cuba.

"Are you Chinese?" the old man asked.

A Chinese comrade raised the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his right hand and pointed to the golden Mao badge on his chest with his left hand, saying, "We are Chinese, from Beijing."

The old farmer said excitedly, "Great! You are comrades from China led by the great Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has made Chinese history advance five hundred years in one go!"

He went on to explain that China's Long March, China's revolution, China's construction, and China's nuclear tests have all achieved such rapid and great victories only under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

The old man excitedly told the Chinese comrades that he had already collected thirty-two single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works. He reads these works whenever he has time.

When the old man found out that the Chinese comrades were holding a Spanish version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he earnestly requested one. The old man said, "I am already sixty-three years old. I have participated in several revolutionary movements in Cuban history. I have read Chairman Mao's books. From my personal experience, I have come to feel that Chairman Mao is the leader of the people of the world."

When parting, the old man raised the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically said to the Chinese comrades, "Comrades, rest assured, I will study this book well!"

Practicing and Applying in Life and Work

A Cuban clerk saw a Spanish version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his friend, which was the treasure book he had longed for. He immediately borrowed it and read it through that night.

The next day, the Cuban clerk visited his familiar Chinese friend and requested a Spanish version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at any cost. After obtaining a "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he said, "I will study this treasure book well, not only reading and studying, but also applying it in life and work like Chinese comrades."

A Cuban female professor received a Spanish version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from her Chinese friend. She held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high and said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a spiritual atomic bomb. The Chinese Red Guards used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Chinese students in Moscow's Red Square used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to oppose the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist leaders. We will also definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon of struggle."

"The 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is a red treasure book. The more you read, the brighter your heart becomes, and the more strength you gain. The picture shows several Guinean workers studying the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.'"

    毛泽东思想是强大的战斗武器
    古巴人民热爱《毛主席语录》努力学习毛泽东思想
    据新华社十六日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴朋友热爱《毛主席语录》，称赞《毛主席语录》是“最宝贵的书”，并且表示要努力学习。
    永远把革命宝书带在身边
    一位无限热爱毛主席的古巴工人每次见到中国同志，都要满怀希望地问一句：“西班牙文版的《毛主席语录》来了吗？我什么时候才能得到这本红色宝书？”
    暂时得不到西班牙文版的《毛主席语录》怎么办呢？这位古巴工人想出了一个办法：他每次和中国同志见面时，都请中国同志拿起中文版的《毛主席语录》为他口头翻译一段，自己则聚精会神地倾听着和记忆着，这差不多成了他同中国同志会面时不可缺少的课程。
    有一天，中国同志把一本西班牙文版的《毛主席语录》送给他。这位古巴工人兴奋地同中国同志紧紧地握手。他激动地说：“太好了！太好了！我终于得到了我等待了许久的宝书。我要永远把《毛主席语录》放在口袋里，随时学习这本宝书。”
    一定好好学习毛泽东思想
    几位中国同志在古巴一个山区旅行的时候遇到了一位古巴老农民。
    “是中国人吗？”老人问道。
    一位中国同志右手举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，左手指着胸前金光闪闪的毛主席像章回答说：“我们是中国人，从北京来的。”
    老农民兴奋地说：“好极了，你们是伟大的毛主席领导下的中国同志。毛主席，是毛主席使中国历史一下子前进了五百年！”
    他接着解释说，中国的长征，中国的革命，中国的建设，中国的核试验，只有在毛主席领导下才取得了那么迅速和那么巨大的胜利。
    老人激动地告诉中国同志，他已经收集到了三十二种毛主席著作单行本。他一有空就阅读这些著作。
    当老人知道中国同志手上拿的是西班牙文版的《毛主席语录》时，便恳切地要求送给他一本。老人说：“我已经六十三岁了。我参加过古巴历史上的好几次革命运动。我读了毛主席的书。我从亲身的经历中体会到，毛主席是世界人民的领袖。”
    分别的时候，老人高举《毛主席语录》，热情地对中国同志说：“同志们，放心吧，我一定好好学习这本书！”
    在生活和工作中活学活用
    一位古巴职员从他的朋友那里看到一本西班牙文版的《毛主席语录》，这正是他向往了许久的宝书，他立刻向那位朋友借来在当天晚上阅读了一遍。
    第二天，这位古巴职员访问了他熟识的中国朋友，要求无论如何为他找一本西班牙文版的《毛主席语录》。当他得到了一本《毛主席语录》以后说：“我一定好好学习这本宝书，不仅阅读和学习，还要象中国同志那样在生活中和工作中活用。”
    一位古巴女教授从中国朋友那里得到一本西班牙文版的《毛主席语录》时，她把《毛主席语录》高高举起来说：“毛泽东思想是精神原子弹。中国红卫兵在中国无产阶级文化大革命中把毛泽东思想作为打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的武器，中国留学生在莫斯科红场把毛泽东思想作为反对苏联修正主义领导人的法西斯暴行的武器，我们也一定把毛泽东思想作为战斗的武器来使用。”
