When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution just began, I did not understand its great significance. I thought that I had some shortcomings and mistakes, which I had already explained during the socialist education movement, so there were no big problems. I did not expect that after the masses were mobilized, they posted many big-character posters saying that I was arbitrary, acted like an official, and was not a servant of the people. This was like a barrage of shells hitting my heart, making me very uncomfortable and afraid of making a self-criticism and losing face. At night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, so I took out "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to study. Chairman Mao said: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticisms and corrections. No matter who points out our mistakes, we should welcome them. If your criticism is correct, we will correct our mistakes. If your method is beneficial to the people, we will adopt it." Chairman Mao's words hit the mark, like a bright lamp illuminating my path forward. I thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants pointing out my mistakes were not to overthrow me, but to help me correct my shortcomings and mistakes. I have shortcomings and mistakes, and I should make a self-criticism to the masses. If I lie down and do nothing, it would be a mistake on top of a mistake.

After correcting my attitude towards the movement, I made a serious self-criticism. After the self-criticism, I worked with everyone to promote the revolution and production, rectifying and changing as we went. For example, in the past, I led production somewhat arbitrarily. Last year, too much fertilizer was applied to the cotton fields, causing the yield to decrease by eight jin per mu compared to the previous year. This year, I will discuss with the community members to apply fertilizer appropriately and ensure a bumper harvest. Some time ago, some community members saw that this year's wheat was not growing very well and lacked confidence in achieving a bumper summer harvest. I discussed solutions with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Old poor peasant Li Huize analyzed: "Although this year's wheat is not growing very well, we should also see the favorable conditions: since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the masses' consciousness has been raised, and their enthusiasm is greater; this year's wheat has more base fertilizer than last year. As long as we strengthen management, once the weather warms up, the wheat seedlings will quickly improve, and achieving a bumper harvest is still possible." Everyone agreed that this opinion was correct and proposed measures such as "managing late-planted crops early and managing coarse-planted crops finely" to further strengthen wheat field management. Currently, all 1,400 mu of wheat fields in the brigade have been fertilized twice, and drainage ditches have been dug throughout.

Originally, I was worried that after my self-criticism, everyone would seize my shortcomings and overturn me. In fact, this concern was unnecessary and showed a lack of trust in the masses. The facts have proven that revolutionary masses are reasonable. They saw that my self-criticism was relatively sincere and that I actively stood up to lead production, so their attitude towards me was very good. Now, when they hold meetings to discuss production, they all want me to participate in the discussion. I also work with everyone every day to fertilize, dig ditches, and engage in production. The broad revolutionary masses are very reasonable and good at grasping the central government's policies. Although I have many shortcomings and mistakes, everyone still, according to Chairman Mao's proposal of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," provided me with patient help. They said: "We are not trying to overturn you, but to eliminate your bad thoughts, so that you can better serve as a good cadre for the people and better serve the people." These words moved me greatly. Everyone's exposure and criticism of me were to help me, save me, and were out of genuine class love.

I personally experienced that no matter how serious the mistakes a cadre makes, as long as they can throw away all personal interests, make a serious self-criticism, correct their mistakes, and stand tall to do their work, they will still be welcomed by the broad poor and lower-middle peasants.

Now the busy spring farming season has arrived. Whether spring farming is good or not will directly affect the harvest for the entire year. We grassroots cadres must actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, firmly stand on the side of revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, promote the revolution, and promote production, and fire the first shot of spring farming.

    丢开私心闹革命　挺起腰杆抓生产
    江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队大队长　孙小观
    在无产阶级文化大革命刚刚开始的时候，我对这次运动的伟大意义很不理解。我觉得自己有些缺点、错误，在社会主义教育运动中已经交代了，问题不大了。没想到群众发动起来以后，大家给我贴了不少大字报，说我独断专行，做官当老爷，不是人民的勤务员。这好象一颗一颗的炮弹打到我心上，心里很不舒服，害怕做检查、丢面子。夜里翻来复去睡不着，我就把《毛主席语录》拿出来学习。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”毛主席的话句句说到我心上，好象一盏明灯照亮了我前进的道路。我想，贫下中农给我提意见，并不是为了把我整倒，而是帮助我把缺点、错误改掉。我有缺点、错误，应该向大家作交代检查。如果躺倒不干，就是错上加错了。
    在端正了对运动的态度以后，我就认真作了检查。检查后，又和大家一起抓革命，促生产，边整边改。例如，我过去领导生产有些地方瞎指挥，去年的棉花施肥太多，使每亩皮棉单产比前年减少八斤。今年，就要和社员群众商量，做到施肥适当，保证丰产。前些时候，有些社员看到今年麦子长势不太好，对争取夏熟丰收缺乏信心。我就和贫下中农商量解决的办法。老贫农李惠泽分析说：“今年麦子虽然长势不大好，可是我们还要看到有利条件：无产阶级文化大革命以来，群众觉悟高了，干劲更大了；今年麦子基肥比去年多，只要加强管理，天气一暖，麦苗就能很快好转，争取丰收还是可能的。”大家都认为这个意见很对，并且提出了“晚种的早管，粗种的细管”等措施，进一步加强麦田管理。目前，全大队一千四百多亩麦田已追肥二遍，全部开了排水沟。
    原来我还担心，我检查以后，大家是不是会抓住我的缺点不放，把我整倒。其实这种顾虑是多余的，是不相信群众的表现。事实证明，革命群众是通情达理的。大家看到我检查比较认真，又能积极站起来领导生产，对我态度很好。现在，他们开会研究生产，都要我一道参加讨论。我也每天和大家一起追肥、开沟搞生产。广大革命群众很讲道理，很会掌握中央的政策。虽然我有不少缺点和错误，大家还是根据毛主席提出的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，对我进行了耐心帮助。大家说：“我们不是要把你整倒，而是要整掉你的坏思想，叫你今后更好地当好人民的干部，更好地为人民服务。”这些话使我非常感动。大家揭发批判我，是为了帮助我，挽救我，是出于真正的阶级友爱。
    我亲身体会到，一个干部不管犯了多么严重的错误，只要能丢开一切私心杂念，认真检查，改正错误，挺起腰杆做好工作，还是会受到广大贫下中农欢迎的。
    现在春耕大忙季节已经到了。春耕生产好不好，直接影响到全年的收成。我们基层干部要积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决站在革命的贫下中农一边，抓革命、促生产，打响春耕第一炮。
