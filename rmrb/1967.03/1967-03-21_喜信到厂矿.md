The morning of March 20th, the Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Works was filled with excitement. Workers, who had just finished their Sunday rest, gathered in groups, enthusiastically cheering, "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have sent us a letter!" Some said, "Last night, I stayed by the radio, listening over and over again. Chairman Mao's words truly resonate in our hearts." Others said, "This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for us. We, the revolutionary masses, must shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

The work bell rang, and people, carrying Chairman Mao's letter, rushed to their respective posts, engaging in intense labor. Machine tools spun rapidly, cranes moved back and forth with a roar, and electric welding flashed with blinding light. Everyone was in a race, no one willing to fall behind.

Look, over there, production service worker Old Zhang was discussing production tasks with a few people. Suddenly, from behind, Little Ma shouted, "Old Zhang, there's another car waiting to be repaired, right?" Before Old Zhang could respond, a few young men rushed forward, speaking like rapid fire, "Our team has several cars to repair today, but there's one car that no one is working on. We'll rearrange the manpower, and three of us can go fix that car." Old Zhang heard this and smiled, quickly saying, "Good! I thought the tasks were heavy today, so I didn't arrange for this car. Can you handle it?" "No problem!" These young men replied while quickly preparing their tools. Soon, the waiting locomotive also started clanking.

Look, over there, Old Liu from the machine tool section stood by a large lathe, sometimes spinning the handwheel rapidly, sometimes concentrating on measuring. Sparks flew from under the cutting tool, and blue chips fell to the ground. He patted the newspaper in his chest pocket, looked at the pile of processed parts beside him, and felt more and more energetic. Seeing that his work was almost done, he rushed to the production service worker to grab more tasks. Just then, he bumped into Little Song and a few other young people there. The production service worker, hearing Old Liu's intention, spread his hands and laughed, "Today, everyone is grabbing tasks. Look, Little Song and his group came before you, and the tasks have already been taken." Little Song made a funny face at Old Liu, then seriously said, "Alright, Old Liu, give you some tasks, let's compete. Use our actions to write a reply to Chairman Mao."

The letter from the Party Central Committee greatly inspired the revolutionary workers. The entire Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Works presented a vibrant new scene.

	"Chairman Mao has sent us a letter!" In the past few days, people at the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory have been talking about the good news, thinking about how to respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call with actual actions.

	In the heavy-duty assembly section, today was particularly lively. On the blackboard by the west wall, large characters read, "Chairman Mao has sent us a letter!" Surrounding it were red and green determination letters. In the middle of the workshop, a newly assembled large special-purpose gantry milling machine was being test-cut. People gathered around the machine, holding their breath, eagerly waiting for the result of whether the machine could cut to the required specifications.

	Nine large milling cutters "swish, swish, swish" cut through the material. In a short while, a shiny large part was test-cut. The inspector took the part, carefully and meticulously inspecting it again and again. Finally, he raised his eyebrows and smiled, "According to the requirements, it is basically qualified." The crowd immediately cheered, jumped, and congratulated each other on the successful completion of the task.

	Just as everyone was overjoyed, the inspector suddenly added a "but." He said, "But, according to the user's requirements, the surface smoothness of this exposed part is still not up to standard."

	The crowd suddenly fell silent, and someone frowned. After a moment, Little Li pushed through the crowd, touching the surface and saying, "It's not that smooth? Look how smooth it is!" Next to him, Little Zhang chimed in, "Exactly, nine cutters cutting together, being able to mill such a smooth surface is already great!"

	Before Little Zhang finished speaking, the heavy-duty station liaison worker, Old Zhao, slowly said, "Having more cutters might affect the smoothness. But we should think about this: this surface is exposed, and our brother factory will use this part to assemble products for export. If the smoothness of this surface is not up to standard, it will affect our entire country's reputation. Can we allow this?" He took out the letter from the Party Central Committee to all revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across the country, and loudly said, "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee call on us to produce quickly, efficiently, and economically, ensuring product quality and striving for high-quality products. What should we do?"

	Little Li and Little Zhang were initially taken aback but immediately said in unison, "We must follow Chairman Mao's words and achieve high quality!" Other comrades also chimed in, "Please rest assured, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, we guarantee to do what we say!" "If it doesn't meet the specifications, it will not leave the factory!"

	Old Zhao, hearing everyone's words, happily said, "Good, that's the spirit. Comrades, we must be meticulous about quality. Although it is not easy to meet the user's requirements, as long as we remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory,' we can complete the task successfully."

	"Right, let's do it!" Everyone rubbed their hands, immediately starting a new battle!

	Beijing First Machine Tool Factory Red Rebellion Propaganda Team

	On the morning of a Sunday, as the clock hands pointed to six-thirty, workers from the electrical section of the machine repair workshop at Guanghua Timber Factory entered the workshop. Last night, they listened to the broadcast, and the Party Central Committee's letter touched their hearts. Everyone was eager to put all their strength into the revolution and production.

	During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary faction of the electrical section was always at the forefront. Now, they are determined to turn the Party Central Committee's call into actual actions, giving up their Sunday rest, and launching a comprehensive repair battle across the entire factory. A master worker left two children who needed looking after, rushing from the front gate to participate in the battle. Several young men who had just finished their night shift also did not rest, voluntarily requesting to join the battle.

	They divided into four teams, enthusiastically working together. Master Li was not feeling well, but the Party Central Committee's letter gave him energy. He quickly climbed up the power pole, working in the high air for several hours. The workers operating in high spaces were tense, and the loudspeaker from the neighboring factory was broadcasting the Party Central Committee's letter. When they heard, "Under these new conditions, we must redouble our efforts, strive to be the best, and become the most outstanding model of the laboring masses across the country in seizing the revolution and promoting production," their hearts were particularly moved, and they worked particularly happily. A few days ago, a line had a problem due to its fine line number and heavy load. To ensure the normal operation of the machines, they planned to replace it with a thicker line. Upon inspection, replacing one line could only temporarily solve the problem. To fundamentally solve the problem, three lines needed to be replaced. Replacing three lines was a large project, but the great sense of responsibility as the master of the country made them overcome the difficulties and complete the task ahead of schedule.

	Today, their work progress was particularly fast, and by around four in the afternoon, they supplied power to the entire factory. The machines in various workshops roared again, as if singing a song of praise for the hardworking electricians.

    喜信到厂矿
    三月二十日，清晨，北京内燃机务段一片欢腾。刚过了星期日的工人们三五成群，热烈地欢呼着：“毛主席、党中央给咱们来信啦！”有的说：“前天晚上，我守在收音机旁，听了一遍又一遍，毛主席的话真是句句说到咱们心坎里。”有的说：“这是毛主席对我们最大的关怀，我们无产阶级革命派就得肩挑革命、生产两副重担，将文化大革命进行到底！”
    上班铃响了，人们揣着毛主席的来信，奔赴各自的战斗岗位，投入了紧张的劳动。机床飞速地转动着，天车轰隆隆地来回移动，电焊闪发着灼眼的光芒，你追我赶，人人不甘落后。
    你看，这边生产服务员老张正在和几个人研究安排生产任务，忽然背后传来小马的喊声：“老张，还有一台车等着修吧？”没等老张回答，几个小伙子一拥而上，连珠炮似地说：“咱组今天要修的车有好几台，可是还有一台车没人干，我们重新安排一下人力，可以抽出三个人去干那台车。”老张一听笑了，连忙说：“好啊！本来我看今天任务够重的，所以就没安排这台车，你们干得了吗？”“没问题！”这几个小伙子一面回答，一面连忙去准备工具，不一会，那台待修的机车上也叮叮当当地响了起来。
    你看，那边机床组的老刘站在一台大车床旁边，一会儿飞速地转着手轮，一会儿又全神贯注地测量，车刀下冒出一缕缕青烟，蔚蓝色的切屑刷刷地往下掉。他摸摸揣在胸口的报纸，低头看看身边加工完的一堆机件，越干越欢，越干越来劲。眼看手下的活很快就要干完了，他就跑到生产服务员那里去抢任务。正好碰上了小宋那几个小青年也在那里。生产服务员一听老刘的来意，摊开了双手，嘿嘿地乐了：“今天啊，大家都来抢任务。你看，小宋他们比你先来一步，活已经抢走了。”小宋冲着老刘做个鬼脸，接着又严肃地说：“行了，老刘，分给你一些活，咱们竞赛吧，用实际行动来给毛主席写回信。”
    党中央的来信，极大地激发了革命职工的干劲。整个内燃机务段呈现着一片热气腾腾的新气象。

    “毛主席给咱们来信啦！”北京第一机床厂这两天来，人们谈的是喜信，心里想的是怎样用实际行动响应毛主席和党中央的号召。
    在重型装配工段，今天显得格外热火。西墙的黑板上，用斗大的字写着“毛主席给咱们来信啦！”四周贴满了红红绿绿的决心书。厂房中间，一台新装配好的大型专用龙门铣床正在试切。机床旁边围满了人，人们屏住声息，焦急地等待着机床能不能切削合格的结果。
    九把大铣刀“刷、刷、刷”地切削着，不一会儿，一个银光闪闪的大零件试切出来了。检验员拿过零件，认真、细致地检验了又检验，最后两道眉毛一扬，笑咧咧地说：“根据要求，基本合格。”人群立刻笑啊，蹦啊，互相祝贺任务胜利完成。
    正当大伙乐开了花的时候，检验员忽然来了个“但是”，只听他说：“但是，根据用户的要求，这个外露面光洁度还差点。”
    人群突然静了下来，有人皱眉了。片刻，小李子忽然钻过人群，用手抚摸着那个面说：“还说不光，看看这有多光！”旁边的小张也接上说：“可不是，九把刀一块切，能铣出这么光的活就够棒的啦！”
    小张的话音未落，重型分站联络员老赵慢条斯理地说：“刀多，可能对光洁度有影响。但是我们再想想，这个面是外露的，兄弟厂用这零件装成的产品出口，要是因为这个面光洁度不够，影响咱们整个国家的威信，这能容许吗？”说着，从怀里掏出党中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信，高声说：“毛主席、党中央号召我们应该多快好省地进行生产，保证产品的质量，力求产品的高质量，我们应该怎么办？”
    小李子和小张开始一愣，马上争着说：“坚决听毛主席的话，做到高质量！”别的同志也你一言，我一语抢着说：“请毛主席和党中央一百个放心，我们保证说到做到！”“不合规格，坚决不出厂！”
    老赵听了大家的话，高兴地说：“好，这才是好样儿的。同志们，我们对质量务必做到一丝不苟。虽然要达到用户的要求不太容易，但是，只要我们牢记毛主席的教导：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’我们就能胜利完成任务。”
    “对，咱们这就干！”人们一个个摩拳擦掌，马上开始了新的战斗！

    星期天的清晨，壁钟的指针刚指向六点半，光华木材厂机修车间电气工段的工人们就走进了车间。昨天晚上，他们听了广播，党中央的信，句句说到了他们心坎里，大伙恨不得把浑身的劲都使到抓革命、促生产上去。
    在文化大革命中，电气工段的革命派样样走在头里。现在，他们决心把党中央的号召变成实际行动，放弃星期天的休息时间，在全厂打一个检修歼灭战。一个老师傅撂下两个需要照看的小孩，大老远从前门赶来参加战斗。几个刚下夜班的小伙子，也不肯休息，主动地要求参加战斗。
    他们兵分四路，欢欢腾腾地大干起来。李师傅本来身体不太舒服，但党中央的信激起了他浑身劲头，他嗖嗖地爬上电线杆去，在高空一连干了好几个钟头。高空作业的同志紧张地操作着，邻厂的喇叭正在播送党中央的信，当他们听到“在这个新的条件下，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，成为现阶段全国劳动群众抓革命、促生产的最出色的模范”时，心情格外激动，干得格外欢快。前些日子，有根线路由于线号细，负荷大，出了点故障，为了不影响机器正常运转，他们准备换上一根线号粗的。上去一看，换一根只能暂时解决问题，要根本解决问题得换三根。换三根虽然工程大，但国家主人翁的伟大责任感使他们克服了困难，提前完成了任务。
    今天他们干活的进度特别快，下午四点多就向全厂供电了，各车间的机器又欢乐地轰鸣起来，好象在为辛勤的电工们唱赞歌。
