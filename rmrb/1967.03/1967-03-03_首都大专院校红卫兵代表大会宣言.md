The East is red, the sun rises. We stand under the radiant morning sun and solemnly declare to all of China and the world: the Capital Colleges and Universities Red Guards Representatives Conference (Red Guards Conference) has been born in the midst of the fierce class struggle!

This is the great unity of the First, Second, and Third Headquarters of the Capital Colleges and Universities Red Guards, along with other Red Guards organizations! This is a great victory for the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao! This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

The Red Guards, this new and vigorous force, have just emerged on the eastern horizon and have already received the warm care and great support of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao. The Red Guards have grown and flourished under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Red Guards are a necessary product of the new stage of socialist revolution in our country and a great innovation in the international communist movement of the 1960s!

From the day of their birth, the Red Guards, with their fearless revolutionary spirit of rebellion, have acted as a political shock force, active on the stage of proletarian revolution. From the day of their birth, the Red Guards, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have, with the strong support of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, swept away the ghosts and snakes, struck down the capitalist reactionary line, thoroughly smashed the "four olds" of the exploiting classes, and established the "four news" of the proletariat, making immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

Today, under the impetus of the great January Revolution in Shanghai and in the storm of revolution where the revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we, the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities, have united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and established our own new type of revolutionary organizational structure—the Capital Colleges and Universities Red Guards Representatives Conference.

Our supreme commander is our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao.

Our supreme headquarters is the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao.

Our guiding ideology is the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Our organizational principle is democratic centralism. We resolutely implement great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat and implement the Paris Commune-style comprehensive electoral system.

Our Red Guards are primarily revolutionary students from the families of the working people (workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and other laborers). Students from non-working-class families who have deep feelings for Chairman Mao, have a revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and have consistently shown good political and ideological performance can also participate.

We resolutely implement the class line of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao, distinguish between enemies and friends, firmly rely on the revolutionary leftists, win over the middle elements, unite the majority, and thoroughly isolate and strike down the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and the most reactionary rightists.

Our battle cry is: "The revolutionary masses of the proletariat are guiltless, rebellion is justified!"

Our representatives conference is the highest authority of the Capital Colleges and Universities Red Guards. During the intervals between conferences, a committee is established as a permanent working body. We must forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make our organization a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our representatives conference firmly stands on the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly smashes the capitalist reactionary line, and struggles to complete the great historical task of "one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms" under the guidance of the Sixteen Points!

Chairman Mao teaches us that the fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been a struggle for power from the very beginning. Our rebellion is to seize power, to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to firmly grasp it in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat forever.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We not only are good at destroying an old world, we also will be good at building a new world." For those units that have been long occupied by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must implement the Marxist principle of smashing the old state machine; there, we must thoroughly destroy the institutions of bourgeois dictatorship and establish new institutions of proletarian dictatorship, and we absolutely cannot engage in compromise, reconciliation, reform, or peaceful transition. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat must continuously strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat in the struggle and establish and consolidate the new revolutionary order, which is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." At present, the struggle between seizing power and counter-seizing power is the focal point of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, like all reactionaries, will not readily accept their failure. "They will not lay down their butcher's knives, and they will not become Buddhas." When the revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite to seize power from them, they will use every means to suppress the revolutionary masses under their temporary control. After the revolutionary masses of the proletariat seize their power, some reactionaries will inevitably collude with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, gather all the social dregs, organize counter-revolutionary forces, and openly engage in counter-seizing power; some reactionaries will also use the tactics of infiltrating and splitting to undermine the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, attempting to usurp the leadership of revolutionary organizations from within and destroy us; they will also create contradictions and sow discord among our revolutionary organizations, dreaming of realizing their evil plot of counter-seizing power. At the same time, in the decisive stage of the struggle between the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers and the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party, the ghosts and snakes in society will also come out in droves and perform on stage, in collusion with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to attack the proletariat. They spread rumors and deceive some ignorant masses, gathering counter-revolutionary organizations, pretending to be revolutionary rebels, and engaging in frenzied counter-revolutionary activities. "To create disorder, to fail, to create more disorder, to fail again, until they are annihilated—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "abandon illusions and prepare for struggle"!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To organize tens of millions of people, to mobilize a vast revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." The revolutionary masses of the proletariat must unite to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and must achieve great unity; without great unity, seizing power will only be an empty slogan. At this critical historical juncture where the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers are engaged in a decisive struggle with the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party, "the urgent task of uniting the masses, we should actively carry out!" The Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities have achieved great unity and solidarity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. To achieve even broader great unity, we advocate that revolutionary factions from various sectors first unite separately, and then achieve the great unity and solidarity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, with the working class as the leader and the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main body.

"Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party." In the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, in order to form a true great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and to achieve a thorough victory in the struggle to seize power, we must act according to the Party's policies and guidelines and must resolutely implement the "three-in-one combination" policy. We must analyze the power-holders by class, and must distinguish whether they are proletarian power-holders or bourgeois power-holders, whether they support and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or support and implement the bourgeois reactionary line. For revolutionary cadres who stand on Chairman Mao's side, we must regard them as the Party's precious assets, protect them, support them actively, and welcome them to fight shoulder to shoulder with us; we must humbly learn from their fighting experience and accept their correct leadership in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. For their shortcomings and mistakes, we must criticize and criticize them sincerely with deep class feelings, and help them correct them according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." We resolutely oppose the erroneous ideas and practices of criticizing, struggling against, and overthrowing power-holders indiscriminately. The ideas of excluding everything, opposing everything, and overthrowing everything are all contrary to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

While we Red Guards are seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must also smash factionalism, windism, small-groupism, and splitism, and smash anarchism! We must carry out a struggle for power in the depths of our souls! Seize the power of "self" and rebel against "self"! Smash "self"!

Without smashing "self," we cannot truly achieve the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Without smashing "self," we cannot truly seize power; even if we seize power, this power will still degenerate into bourgeois power.

Without smashing "self," we cannot become thorough revolutionaries.

To smash "self," we must seriously and diligently study Chairman Mao's works. At present, we must especially study and apply the "Three Articles" and the "Five New Articles" ("On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Against Liberalism," "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Reissuance of the Three Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention," "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," and "The Working Methods of the Party Committee") and other brilliant works.

To smash "self," we must carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls and engage in active ideological struggle.

To smash "self," we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and implement the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants, thoroughly reform our worldview in the three great revolutionary practices, and establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

We Red Guards are the reliable reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. We must carry forward the "Three-Eight Style," strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline; be ready to fight and win when called upon; be ready to join the army and fight at any time, and give a resounding blow to all enemies who dare to invade.

We Red Guards swear to be thorough revolutionaries of the proletariat. We will forever hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, forever preserve the revolutionary spirit of rebellion. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, whoever dares to promote revisionism in China, no matter how high their position, how long their term, or how great their reputation, we will resolutely rebel against them and rebel to the end! We will definitely keep New China forever red, and make the imperialists' and modern revisionists' dream of "peaceful evolution" completely collapse!

We Red Guards will forever be the vanguard fighters against imperialism and revisionism. We fully support the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations, stand firmly with them, and thoroughly bury imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and carry the world revolution through to the end!

We firmly believe that communism will definitely be victorious! All devils will be annihilated. Look at the future world, it will definitely be a world of red flags, it will definitely be a world illuminated by the great and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought!

Comrades of the Red Guards, let us be revolutionaries to the end, and not just fleeting figures on the stage of history. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, create new achievements and new labor for the revolution, and forever follow Chairman Mao in the great waves of class struggle! Forward! Forward! Forward!

Long live the Red Guards!

Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat!

Long live the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会宣言
    （一九六七年二月二十二日）
    新华社二日讯　首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会（红代会）宣言（一九六七年二月二十二日）
    东方红，太阳升。我们迎着万丈朝霞向全中国、全世界庄严宣告：首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会（红代会），在激烈的阶级斗争的暴风雨中光荣诞生了！
    这是首都大专院校红卫兵第一司令部、第二司令部革命造反联络站、第三司令部和其它红卫兵组织的大联合，大团结，大会师！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    红卫兵这一具有强大生命力的新生事物，刚刚从东方地平线上出现，就得到我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的亲切关怀和巨大支持。红卫兵是在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长壮大的。
    红卫兵是我国社会主义革命新阶段的必然产物，是二十世纪六十年代国际共产主义运动中的伟大创举！
    红卫兵从她诞生那天起，就以其大无畏的革命造反精神，作为一支政治突击力量，活跃于无产阶级革命的历史舞台。红卫兵从她诞生那天起，就以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在工农兵强有力的支持下，横扫牛鬼蛇神，痛击资产阶级反动路线，大破剥削阶级“四旧”，大立无产阶级“四新”，为我国无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。
    今天，在伟大的上海“一月革命”洪流的推动下，在无产阶级革命派联合起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的革命风暴中，我们首都大专院校红卫兵，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下胜利会师，成立了我们自己的新型的革命组织机构——首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会。
    我们的最高统帅是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。
    我们的最高司令部是以毛主席为首的党中央。
    我们的指导思想是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    我们的组织原则是民主集中制。我们坚决实行无产阶级专政下的大民主，实行巴黎公社式的全面选举制。
    我们红卫兵以劳动人民家庭（工、农、兵、革命干部和其他劳动者）出身的革命学生为主体。非劳动人民家庭出身的学生，对毛主席有深厚感情，有无产阶级的革命精神，一贯在政治思想上表现比较好的，也可以参加。
    我们坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党的阶级路线，分清敌我友，坚决依靠革命的左派，争取中间派，团结大多数，彻底孤立和打击一小撮反革命修正主义分子和最反动的资产阶级右派分子。
    我们的战斗口号是：“无产阶级革命派革命无罪，造反有理！”
    我们的代表大会是首都大专院校红卫兵的最高权力机构。在代表大会闭会期间，设立一个委员会，作为常设工作机构。我们一定要永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把我们的组织办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    我们的代表大会坚定不移地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，以十六条为纲，为胜利完成一斗二批三改的伟大历史任务而奋斗！
    毛主席教导我们，革命的根本问题是政权问题。“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”无产阶级文化大革命从一开始就是一场夺权斗争。我们造反，就是要夺权，就是在无产阶级专政条件下，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手里把权夺回来，永远牢牢地掌握在我们无产阶级革命派手中。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”对于那些被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派长期盘踞的烂掉了的单位，必须实行马克思主义的打碎旧的国家机器的原则；在那里彻底摧毁资产阶级专政的机构，重新建立无产阶级专政的机构，绝不能搞折衷、调和、改良和和平过渡。无产阶级革命派要在斗争中不断强化无产阶级专政，建立和巩固革命的新秩序，这是将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的根本保证。
    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”目前，夺权与反夺权的斗争是两个阶级两条道路斗争的焦点。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切反动派一样，他们决不甘心自己的失败，“不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛”。在无产阶级革命派联合起来向他们夺权的时候，他们总要利用暂时控制在他们手中的权力，千方百计地镇压革命群众。在无产阶级革命派夺了他们的权以后，有些反动家伙必然会勾结地、富、反、坏、右分子，搜罗一切社会渣滓，组织反革命队伍，公开进行反夺权；有些反动家伙还会用打进来、拉出去的办法，分化瓦解无产阶级革命派的大联合，妄图篡夺革命组织的领导权，从内部把我们搞垮；他们也还会在我们革命派组织之间，制造矛盾，挑拨离间，梦想实现他们反夺权的罪恶阴谋。同时，在无产阶级和广大劳动人民同资产阶级及其在党内代理人的决战阶段，社会上的牛鬼蛇神也会纷纷出笼，登台表演，配合党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派向无产阶级进攻。他们到处煽阴风、点邪火，造谣惑众，欺骗拉拢一些不明真相的群众，拼凑反革命组织，冒充革命造反派，疯狂地进行反革命活动。“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”我们必须遵照毛主席的教导，“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”！
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”无产阶级革命派要向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开夺权斗争，就必须大联合；没有大联合，夺权就只能是一句空话。在当前无产阶级和广大劳动人民同资产阶级及其在党内代理人进行决战的重大历史关头，“刻不容缓的民众大联合，我们应该积极进行！”我们首都大专院校红卫兵在毛泽东思想原则的基础上实行了大联合、大团结。为了实现更广泛的大联合，我们主张各界革命派先分别联合起来，然后实现以工人阶级为领导，以工农兵为主体的首都无产阶级革命派的大团结、大联合。
      “政策和策略是党的生命”。在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，为了形成真正的无产阶级革命派的大联合，为了获得夺权斗争的彻底胜利，我们必须按照党的方针政策办事，必须坚定不移地实行“三结合”的方针。对当权派要作阶级分析，一定要分清是无产阶级当权派，还是资产阶级当权派，是拥护和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，还是拥护和执行资产阶级反动路线。对于站在毛主席一边的革命领导干部，我们必须把他们当作党的宝贵财富，爱护他们，保护他们，积极地支持他们，热情地欢迎他们同我们并肩战斗；必须虚心地向他们学习斗争经验，接受他们符合毛泽东思想的正确领导。对于他们的缺点、错误，要怀着深厚的阶级感情进行诚恳的批评、批判，本着毛主席教导我们的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的原则帮助他们改正。我们坚决反对不分青红皂白，见了当权派就批、就斗、就打倒的错误思想和做法。那些排斥一切、反对一切、打倒一切的思想都是违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的。
    我们红卫兵在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的同时，必须打倒山头主义、风头主义、小团体主义、分裂主义，打倒无政府主义！必须在自己灵魂深处来一场夺权斗争！夺“私”字的权，造“私”字的反！打倒“私”字！
    不打倒“私”字，就不能真正实现无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    不打倒“私”字，就不能真正夺权；即使夺了权，这个权也还会蜕化为资产阶级政权。
    不打倒“私”字，我们就不能成为彻底的革命者。
    打倒“私”字，必须认真地、刻苦地学习毛主席著作。在当前特别要活学活用“老三篇”和“新五篇”（《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》《整顿党的作风》《党委会的工作方法》）等光辉著作。
    打倒“私”字，必须在自己灵魂深处闹革命，开展积极的思想斗争。
    打倒“私”字，必须遵循毛主席的教导，实行和工农相结合，在三大革命实践中，彻底改造自己的世界观，树立全心全意为工农兵服务的思想。
    我们红卫兵是解放军坚强可靠的后备军。我们要大兴三八作风，加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性；做到召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜；随时准备参军参战，迎头痛击一切敢于来犯的敌人。
    我们红卫兵誓作彻底的无产阶级革命派。我们要永远高举革命的批判的大旗，永葆革命造反的青春。谁敢反对毛主席，谁敢反对毛泽东思想，谁敢在中国搞修正主义，不管他地位多高，资格多老，声望多大，我们都要坚决造他的反，一反到底！我们一定要使新中国永远保持通红的颜色，让帝国主义和现代修正主义“和平演变”的幻想彻底破产！
    我们红卫兵永做反帝反修的先锋战士。我们全力支持被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争，坚定地和他们站在一起，彻底埋葬帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，将世界革命进行到底！
    我们坚信，共产主义一定胜利！一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。试看将来的环球，必定是赤旗的世界，必定是伟大的毛泽东思想光辉普照的世界！
    红卫兵战友们，我们要做革命到底的战士，决不做历史舞台上昙花一现的人物。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续发扬无产阶级革命精神，为革命建新功、立新劳，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，永远紧跟毛主席前进！前进！前进！
    红卫兵万岁！
    无产阶级革命精神万岁！
    无产阶级革命派大联合万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
        首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会
