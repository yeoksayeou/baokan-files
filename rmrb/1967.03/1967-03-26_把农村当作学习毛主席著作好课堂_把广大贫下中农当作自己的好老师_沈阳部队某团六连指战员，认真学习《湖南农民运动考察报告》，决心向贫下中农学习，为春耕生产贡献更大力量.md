Soldiers of the Sixth Company of a Certain Regiment in the Shenyang Military Region are earnestly studying "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and have resolved to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, contributing more to the spring plowing and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 25th: The soldiers of the Sixth Company, a "Four Good" company in a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army Shenyang Military Region, have been studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" while supporting the spring plowing and production in the rural people's communes. They enthusiastically praise the revolutionary spirit and noble qualities of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and have resolved to learn from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, further promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts, and contributing more to the spring plowing and production.

After arriving in the countryside, the soldiers of the Sixth Company regard the countryside as a good classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the poor and lower-middle peasants as their good teachers. While enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, they have earnestly studied "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Chairman Mao said: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you are denying the revolution. If you attack them, you are attacking the revolution. Their revolutionary direction has never been wrong." The soldiers, combining their own experiences in the countryside, have gained a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's wise statements. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Liujia Brigade, where the Sixth Company is stationed, have, as Chairman Mao praised, firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When some people with ulterior motives incited uninformed masses to direct the struggle against the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, the poor and lower-middle peasants stood up and stopped them. They conducted ideological struggles in the spirit of the Sixteen Points, using Mao Zedong Thought to launch political offensives, educating the deceived masses to stand up and expose the plots of a handful of people with ulterior motives. The soldiers of the Sixth Company also learned that the poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade have always been the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words in major political movements such as land reform and agricultural cooperativization, firmly standing in the forefront. The soldiers enthusiastically praised the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Comrade Yang Zhaoqing, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and the company commander, said: "We will learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants to be like them, always the vanguard of the revolution, always adhering to the revolutionary direction. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad revolutionary masses, and wage a resolute struggle against the capitalist restorationist current, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

In their interactions with the poor and lower-middle peasants, the soldiers of the Sixth Company deeply felt that the poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao and listen most to Chairman Mao's words. The soldiers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's words: "The main force of the long-term struggle in the countryside has always been the poor peasants. From the secret period to the open period, the poor peasants have been actively struggling. They listen most to the leadership of the Communist Party. They are mortal enemies of the local bullies and evil gentry, and they attack the camp of the local bullies and evil gentry without hesitation." The soldiers of the Seventh Platoon saw that the old poor peasant Sun Guoxing of the Second Production Team was earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works during the spring plowing and production, actively responding to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and taking the initiative to shoulder the heavy task of repairing the sweet potato kiln for the entire team. After repairing the sweet potato kiln, he guarded the more than ten thousand catties of sweet potato seeds for the entire team. To ensure that the sweet potato seeds were not damaged, he built a shed by the sweet potato kiln, living and sleeping there, day and night without leaving. Soldier Cao Wenlin visited this old poor peasant, and Sun Guoxing said to him: "Chairman Mao is my savior. I would rather die than give up Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao calls on me to grasp revolution and promote production, and I will definitely do it without hesitation." Returning to the platoon, Cao Wenlin reported to all his comrades: "From Grandpa Sun, I learned a lot. We should be like him, having the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao, listening most to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions." The other comrades in the Seventh Platoon also expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to actively support the broad masses of the left, and shoulder the heavy task of grasping revolution and promoting production with the commune members. The next day, they worked with greater enthusiasm and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, completed the task of digging manure excellently.

The soldiers of the Sixth Company have earnestly studied "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and humbly learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. They have adopted various methods to more enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the poor and lower-middle peasants, praising the main force army of grasping revolution and promoting production in the countryside, and publicizing their good deeds in the spring plowing and production; in production labor, the soldiers, like the poor and lower-middle peasants, were spirited and full of fighting spirit. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants praised them, saying: "You are indeed good soldiers educated by Chairman Mao and good sons and daughters of the people."

    把农村当作学习毛主席著作好课堂
    把广大贫下中农当作自己的好老师
    沈阳部队某团六连指战员，认真学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》，决心向贫下中农学习，为春耕生产贡献更大力量
    据新华社沈阳二十五日电　人民解放军沈阳部队某团四好连队六连的指战员，在支援农村人民公社春耕生产中，认真学习毛主席的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》，热情赞扬贫下中农的革命精神和高尚品质，决心向广大贫下中农学习，进一步促进思想革命化，为春耕生产贡献更大力量。
    六连指战员到农村以后，把农村当作活学活用毛主席著作的好课堂，把贫下中农当作自己的好老师。他们在热情宣传毛泽东思想的同时，认真学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》。毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。他们的革命大方向始终没有错。”指战员们结合自己在农村所接触到的情况，对毛主席的这些英明论断有了更深切的体会。六连所在的刘家大队的贫下中农在无产阶级文化大革命中，正如毛主席所赞扬的一样，紧紧掌握了革命斗争的大方向。在无产阶级文化大革命中，当一些别有用心的人挑动不明真相的群众，把斗争矛头指向贫下中农和革命干部的时候，贫下中农挺身而出，予以制止。他们按照十六条的精神，进行了说理斗争，用毛泽东思想展开政治攻势，教育受蒙蔽的群众纷纷站出来，揭发了一小撮别有用心的人的阴谋活动。六连指战员又了解到，这个大队的贫下中农在土地改革、农业合作化等重大政治运动中，都是最听毛主席的话，坚定地站在最前列。指战员们热情赞扬了贫下中农的这种革命精神。学习毛主席著作积极分子、连长杨兆兴表示：我们向贫下中农学习，就要象他们那样，永远做革命的先锋，永远坚持革命的大方向，在无产阶级文化大革命中，和贫下中农及广大革命派一起，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线这一边，同资产阶级反动路线进行坚决的斗争，打退资本主义复辟的逆流，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    六连指战员在和贫下中农接触中，深深感到贫下中农对毛主席有最深的阶级感情，最听毛主席的话。指战员们反复学习了毛主席说的：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。从秘密时期到公开时期，贫农都在那里积极奋斗。他们最听共产党的领导。他们和土豪劣绅是死对头，他们毫不迟疑地向土豪劣绅营垒进攻。”七班战士看见第二生产队老贫农孙国兴，在春耕生产中认真学习毛主席著作，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，主动挑起修理全队地瓜炕的重担。修好了地瓜炕，他又看管全队两万多斤地瓜种。为了使地瓜种不受一点损失，他在地瓜炕边搭个窝棚，在里边吃住，日夜不离开。战士曹文林访问了这位老贫农，孙国兴对他说：“毛主席是俺的再生父母。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。毛主席号召俺抓革命、促生产，俺就坚决做到，决不含糊。”回到班里，曹文林向全班同志介绍说：“从孙大爷身上我学到了不少东西。我们干革命就要象他那样，对毛主席有最深厚的阶级感情，最听毛主席的话，最按毛主席的指示办事。”七班其他同志也纷纷表示要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，坚决响应毛主席积极支持左派广大群众的号召，和社员们一道挑起抓革命、促生产的重担。第二天，他们以更大的劳动热情，和贫下中农一起刨粪，出色地完成了任务。
    六连指战员认真学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》，虚心向贫下中农学习，促进了思想革命化。他们采取各种方法，更加热情地向贫下中农宣传毛泽东思想，赞扬农村中贫下中农这支抓革命促生产的主力大军，宣扬他们在春耕生产中的好人好事；在生产劳动中，指战员们和贫下中农一样，精神焕发，斗志昂扬。广大贫下中农称赞他们说：“你们不愧是毛主席教育出来的好战士，人民的好子弟兵。”
