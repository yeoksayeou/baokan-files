The proletarian revolutionary faction of Guiyang Cotton Mill, the first in Guizhou Province to achieve great unity based on administrative departments, has, after seizing power, smashed the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, and fostered a spirit of daring to think and act. They have overcome one technical difficulty after another, achieving the highest quality of dyed cloth since the mill's establishment, with stable production increases and significant cost reductions.

Since February, the mill's dyed cloth first-grade rate has consistently reached over 90%, far exceeding the national standard. On average, the amount of dye used for every 10,000 meters of dyed cloth has been reduced by 10% compared to the past. Additionally, by using the method of caustic soda waste liquor desizing, the mill saves 400 kilograms of caustic soda per month. The mill, which previously did not produce deep red cloth, now produces it with vibrant and fiery colors.

Guiyang Cotton Mill is the largest cotton mill in Guizhou Province, established in 1960 and starting production in 1961. The mill has new facilities, good equipment, and relatively strong technical capabilities. However, due to the seizure of power by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the product quality has never met national standards, with the first-grade rate of dyed cloth never exceeding 45%. Workers had proposed many valuable suggestions, with some veteran workers proposing over 20 rational suggestions, but all were suppressed by the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" within the mill. Sometimes, they didn't even look at the suggestion letters, throwing them into the wastepaper basket.

On January 19, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the mill united to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. Based on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" principle, they conducted a class analysis of the leading cadres and technical personnel, inviting a group of revolutionary cadres and technical personnel to participate in the mill and workshop production leadership teams. They also, following Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely overthrew the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities," discarded all foreign dogmas and frameworks, and always followed the mass line, respecting the pioneering spirit of the masses. After seizing power, veteran worker Lu Zhongbao proactively discussed with members of the workshop production leadership small group and re-proposed the suggestion to improve the weft density of dyed cloth, which had been suppressed by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. The workshop leadership small group immediately supported this and dispatched technician Tang Zhaohua and several workers to study with him, improving some equipment, and finally solving the key problem that had not been resolved for over six years, making the weft density of dyed cloth exceed the national standard. Veteran worker Cao Jinbao and others also, on the day after seizing power, proactively proposed utilizing the waste liquor of 190# silk blue dye, which was immediately supported. This suggestion, when implemented, reduced the amount of dye used for every 10,000 meters of silk blue cloth by nearly 3% compared to the past. This experience has been promoted in the dyeing of other colored cloths, saving the nation over 240,000 yuan annually. Two young workers in the printing and dyeing workshop, to solve the long-standing problem of alum-drawn light blue cloth turning red, proactively restarted the steam box, which had been idle for over three years due to the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" claiming insufficient technical capabilities. Under the guidance of veteran workers, they successfully operated this machine, significantly improving the quality of alum-drawn light blue cloth.

By early March, after the proletarian revolutionary faction of the mill achieved great unity based on administrative departments, even better conditions were created for technological innovation. The revolutionary factions of the finishing, bleaching, and maintenance sections in the printing and dyeing workshop encouraged, supported, and assisted each other, launching large-scale cooperation. In a short period, they overcame ten major production bottlenecks, achieving a significant victory in improving the quality of dyed cloth.

    贵阳棉纺厂革命职工大破资产阶级“权威”
    革命放在首位  生产迅猛发展
    色布质量达到建厂以来最高水平，产量上升，成本降低
    新华社贵阳电　贵州省第一个按行政部门实现大联合的贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派，在取得夺权胜利之后，大破资产阶级反动技术“权威”，调动职工群众的积极性和创造性，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，连连攻克技术难关，使色布的质量创造了建厂以来的最高水平，产量稳定上升，成本显著降低。
    二月份以来，这个厂出厂色布的一等品率天天达到百分之九十以上，大大超过了国家规定的指标；平均每染一万米色布所用的染料，也比过去节约了百分之十；同时，因为采用了烧碱废液退浆的办法，每月可节约烧碱四百公斤。这个厂过去从来没有生产过的大红布，现在也染出来了，而且色泽瑰丽，鲜红似火。
    贵阳棉纺厂是贵州省最大的一个棉纺厂，一九六○年建厂，一九六一年开始投入生产。厂房新，设备好，技术力量也较强。可是，过去因为被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派篡夺了领导权，产品质量一直达不到国家标准，色布一等品率最高也没有超过百分之四十五。工人们也曾提了许多宝贵的建议，有的老工人先后提出过二十多次合理建议，但都遭到厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”的压制。他们有时甚至连建议书都不看，就把它丢进了字纸篓里。
    今年一月十九日，这个厂的无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。无产阶级革命派根据革命的“三结合”的方针，对领导干部和技术人员进行了阶级分析，吸收一批革命的领导干部和革命的技术人员参加了厂和车间的生产领导班子。他们还按照毛主席的教导，坚决打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”，甩掉一切洋教条、洋框框，处处走群众路线，尊重群众的首创精神。老师傅陆忠宝在夺权后主动和车间生产领导小组的成员研究，重新提出了过去被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派压制的改进色布纬密度的建议。车间领导小组立刻加以支持，并且派了技术员唐照华和几个工人与他一起研究，改进了一些设备，终于解决了六年多来一直没有解决的关键问题，使色布的纬密度超过了国家标准。老工人曹金宝等，也在夺权的第二天，主动提出了利用一九○号士林蓝布染料废液的建议，并立即得到支持。这一建议实现后，使每染一万米士林蓝布所用的染料，比过去减少了将近百分之三。这一经验已在染其它品种色布时加以推广，一年可为国家节约二十四万多元。印染车间的两个青年工人为了解决过去长期无法解决的矾拉明蓝布泛红问题，主动地启用了被资产阶级反动技术“权威”借口技术力量不够而停用了三年多的蒸气箱，并在老工人的指导下，成功地操纵了这台机器，使矾拉明蓝布的质量大大提高。
    三月初，这个厂的无产阶级革命派按行政部门实现大联合后，更为技术革新创造了良好条件。印染车间的整理、漂白、保全等工段的无产阶级革命派互相鼓励，互相支援，互相帮助，开展大协作，在较短时间内连连攻克了十大生产关键，在提高色布质量上打了一个漂亮仗。
