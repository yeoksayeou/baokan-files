The heroic military and civilian people of West Ninh Province in South Vietnam have unleashed the invincible power of people's war. Since early February this year, they have bravely fought and successfully repelled two major "sweeping operations" launched by US puppet forces and their mercenaries, achieving a magnificent victory of annihilating over 8,300 enemy troops.

According to a recent battle report from the Southern East Zone Command of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces, the 8,300 enemy troops annihilated by the military and civilian people of West Ninh Province were almost entirely US invaders. This included the complete annihilation of three US armored battalions, one infantry battalion, one artillery battalion, and thirteen infantry companies and five artillery companies, as well as severely damaging four US infantry battalions. At the same time, the liberation forces also destroyed 692 enemy vehicles of various types, including 387 M-41 tanks and M-113 armored personnel carriers, shot down 119 enemy aircraft of various types, and destroyed 64 cannons.

The report states that in order to salvage its failures on various battlefields in South Vietnam, the US aggressors launched a large-scale "sweeping operation" in the northern part of West Ninh Province on February 22, mobilizing 45,000 enemy troops (almost all of their forces in the Southern East Zone) and a large number of aircraft. They attempted to annihilate the main forces of the liberation army. The military and civilian people of West Ninh Province, upholding their glorious tradition of bravery and indomitability, continuously and bravely struck the enemy, inflicting a heavy and comprehensive defeat on the US invaders, forcing them to abandon the operation midway.

The report points out that the great victory in West Ninh demonstrates the firm resolve of the military and civilian people of West Ninh Province and the Southern East Zone to defeat the US aggressors. This unshakable willpower is unyielding to any material force and unshakable by any cunning tactics.

The report states that the magnificent victory of the military and civilian people of West Ninh Province has dealt a fatal blow to the US aggressors' second "dry season counteroffensive plan." The great victory in West Ninh shows that the more troops and weapons the US aggressors send to South Vietnam, the more severe their defeats will be. The US aggressors are trembling with fear and their morale is plummeting in the face of the people's war waged by the liberation forces.

The report states that during the anti-"sweeping operation" battles, the military and civilian people of West Ninh Province destroyed 387 tanks and armored personnel carriers, accounting for 48% of the enemy's total vehicles used in the operation. This victory has once again proven the failure of the US's main tactic—the "armored vehicle tactic," further demoralizing the enemy.

The report points out that although the US aggressors suffered a crushing defeat, they will continue to struggle desperately. The report calls on all military and civilian people of West Ninh Province and the Southern East Zone to remain highly vigilant, ready to thwart any "sweeping operations" by the enemy at any time, and to launch fierce attacks on the enemy to achieve more magnificent victories.

    发挥人民战争的无比威力　粉碎美帝两次大规模“扫荡”
    西宁军民二月以来歼敌八千多
    新华社河内二十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：英雄的越南南方西宁省军民，发挥人民战争的无敌威力，从今年二月初以来，勇敢战斗，先后粉碎了美伪军和帮凶军对西宁省发动的两次大规模“扫荡”，取得了歼敌八千三百多名的辉煌战果。
    据越南南方解放通讯社援引越南南方解放武装力量南部东区指挥部最近发表的一项战绩公报说，据不完全统计，被西宁省军民歼灭的八千三百名敌人，几乎全部是美国侵略军，其中包括全歼美军三个装甲营，一个步兵营、一个炮兵营和十三个步兵连、五个炮兵连，重创美军四个步兵营。与此同时，解放武装力量还击毁敌人各种军车六百九十二辆，其中有M—41型坦克和M—113型装甲车三百八十七辆，击落各种类型敌机一百一十九架，击毁大炮六十四门。
    公报说，美国强盗为了挽救它在越南南方各个战场上的失败，今年二月二十二日出动四万五千名敌人（几乎动用了它在南部东区的全部兵力）和大批飞机，对西宁省北部发动了大规模“扫荡”，妄图消灭解放军的主力部队。西宁省军民发扬英勇不屈的光荣传统，连续地、英勇地打击敌人，使美国侵略者遭到了极其惨重的全面的失败，从而被迫中途放弃了这次“扫荡”。
    公报指出，西宁大捷显示了西宁省军民和南部东区军民决心战胜美国强盗的坚强意志。南越军民的这一坚如磐石的意志，是任何物质力量也屈服不了、任何阴险手段也动摇不了的。
    公报说，西宁省军民的辉煌胜利，给美国强盗的第二个“旱季战略反攻计划”以致命的打击。西宁大捷表明，美国强盗向越南南方增派的军队、增运的武器越多，它遭到的失败也就越惨重。美国侵略军在解放武装力量进行的人民战争面前，胆战心惊，士气低落。
    公报说，在反“扫荡”战斗中，西宁省军民击毁坦克和装甲车三百八十七辆，占敌人在“扫荡”中使用的军车总数的百分之四十八。这一胜利使美国的主要战术——“装甲车战术”再一次遭到破产，使敌人的士气更加低落。
    公报指出，美国强盗虽然遭到了惨败，但是它还会进行疯狂地挣扎。公报号召西宁省和南部东区全体军民保持高度警惕，随时准备挫败敌人进行的一切“扫荡”，同时猛烈进攻敌人，以夺取更多的巨大胜利。（附图片）
