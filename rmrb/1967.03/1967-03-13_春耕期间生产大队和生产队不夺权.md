Since the issuance of the Party Central Committee's directive on the Cultural Revolution in rural areas, the vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres across the country have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhered to the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao, and launched a massive struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the reactionary elements among the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. They have achieved great victories. The situation of the Cultural Revolution in rural areas is excellent!

Under such a favorable situation, the poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres in various places are actively implementing Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are uniting the broad masses of the people, mobilizing all forces, and with the support of local garrison troops and relevant departments, are launching a magnificent spring plowing and production campaign.

To do a good job in this year's spring plowing and production is a matter of the utmost importance that concerns the harvest of the entire year's agricultural production, concerns "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," concerns the smooth progress of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and concerns the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a serious political struggle.

To concentrate forces and win the battle of spring plowing and production, the Party Central Committee directs: During the peak spring plowing season, production brigades and production teams should not engage in power struggles.

This directive is another major measure to implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." It represents the demands and interests of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the people of the entire country. It will promote the spring plowing and production in rural areas to a new high. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres at all levels must seriously study this directive and resolutely implement it.

Production brigades and production teams that have already seized power and have been approved by revolutionary masses and higher authorities should shoulder the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. They should be pioneers in revolution and models in promoting production, leading the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, overcome all difficulties, and successfully complete the spring plowing and production tasks.

In production brigades and production teams where leadership is weak or scattered, poor and lower-middle peasant activists and revolutionary cadres should step forward and form temporary leadership teams. They should use Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize all positive factors and focus on spring plowing and production.

During the peak spring plowing season, production brigades and production teams should not engage in power struggles. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres should maintain a higher level of vigilance, prevent all class enemies from engaging in sabotage and restoration activities, and resolutely defend the achievements of the Four Cleanups. In places where the Four Cleanups have already been conducted, it is not allowed for those who have taken the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements to overturn their cases. If they dare to do so, they should be immediately punished.

The Party Central Committee believes that the majority of rural cadres (including those in leading positions) are good or relatively good. For cadres who have made mistakes, they should be criticized and educated according to Chairman Mao's principle of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient." As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on their mistakes and are not reformed despite repeated education, they should be allowed to reform and be encouraged to redeem themselves.

"Grasp revolution, promote production" is Chairman Mao's consistent strategic thinking. Only by focusing on the Cultural Revolution, firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought, and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking can we ensure that spring plowing and production are done well.

Comrades, poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural areas, let us actively respond to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, unite as one, strive together, and contribute all our strength to do a good job in spring plowing and production, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year!

    春耕期间生产大队和生产队不夺权
    党中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示发布以来，全国农村广大贫下中农和革命干部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造坚持反动立场的地富反坏右分子的反，取得了很大的胜利。农村文化大革命的形势一片大好！
    在这样的大好形势下，各地农村的贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，积极贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，团结广大群众，动员一切力量，在当地驻军和有关部门的支援下，正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的春耕生产高潮。
    搞好今年的春耕生产，这是关系到全年农业生产的收成，关系到“备战、备荒、为人民”，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，关系到巩固无产阶级政权的头等大事。这是一场严重的政治斗争。
    为了集中力量打好春耕生产这一仗，夺取春耕生产的胜利，党中央指示：在春耕大忙期间，生产大队和生产队不要进行夺权斗争。
    这一指示，是贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的又一重大措施。它代表了广大贫下中农和全国人民的要求和利益，它将推动农村春耕生产走向新的高潮。广大贫下中农和各级革命干部，必须认真学习这个指示，坚决贯彻执行。
    已经夺权并经革命群众和上级同意的生产大队和生产队的领导班子，应该切实地挑起革命和生产的两副重担，当抓革命的闯将，做促生产的模范，带领广大贫下中农和革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，克服一切困难，胜利地完成春耕生产的战斗任务。
    领导软弱或涣散的生产大队和生产队，贫下中农积极分子和革命干部应该挺身而出，组成临时的领导班子，用毛泽东思想调动一切积极因素，抓好春耕生产。
    在春耕大忙期间，生产大队和生产队不进行夺权斗争，广大贫下中农和革命群众，要保持更高的警惕性，严防一切阶级敌人进行破坏活动和复辟活动，要坚决保卫四清运动成果。在已经进行过四清的地方，决不允许那些走资本主义道路的下台干部和地富反坏右分子翻案。如果他们胆敢这样做，就立即予以制裁。
    党中央认为，农村干部（包括正职）大多数是好的和比较好的，对于犯有错误的干部，应该本着毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，对他们进行批评教育，帮助他们改正错误。只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。
    “抓革命，促生产”是毛主席一贯的战略思想。只有抓好文化大革命，大立毛泽东思想，促进人的思想革命化，才能保证把春耕生产搞好。
    贫下中农和农村革命干部同志们，让我们积极响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，团结一致，共同奋斗，为搞好春耕生产，夺取今年农业大丰收贡献一切力量！
