Chairman Mao has proposed that in places and units where power needs to be seized, the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is best called the Revolutionary Committee.

Chairman Mao has timely pointed out the direction for us.

Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers and staff, and revolutionary cadres of Shandong Institute of Technology have achieved the "three-in-one combination" and successfully seized the power from the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road within the Institute Party Committee on February 22. They formed the new temporary power organ of the entire institute—the Shandong Institute of Technology Revolutionary Committee.

In the period before the seizure of power, there were two incorrect thoughts on the issue of cadres: Some comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, during the struggle, formed a fighting friendship with some revolutionary cadres, but due to the slandering and incitement by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they deliberately smeared some revolutionary cadres, and some of our comrades were also influenced, fearing that they would be labeled as "conservatives" if they combined with revolutionary cadres. Others were influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line, did not use class standpoint to analyze cadres comprehensively, but used metaphysical views to look at cadres, doubting everything and negating everything.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at identifying cadres. We must not only look at a cadre's one-time deed, but also at the cadre's entire history and work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Based on this principle, we criticized the above two wrong thoughts. At the same time, we went to the masses to investigate and study, and made an initial analysis of the cadres in our institute, which can be roughly divided into four types:

The first type: From the beginning of the movement, they resisted the bourgeois reactionary line and later firmly carried out the proletarian revolutionary line. These cadres are the precious wealth of the Party and the people, and they are the force we must firmly rely on.

The second type: They made some mistakes in the movement or before the movement, and have made some self-criticisms, but they are hesitant and dare not openly support the leftists. After the help and education of the proletarian revolutionary faction, their attitude became clearer in the later period. These cadres should be actively won over and combined with.

The third type: They are cadres who made relatively serious mistakes. We should further explain the policy to them, help them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and dare to stand out. If they sincerely correct their mistakes, some of them can also participate in the "three-in-one combination" leadership.

The fourth type: They are the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and must be firmly overthrown.

We focused on working with the first two types of cadres, especially encouraging the second type of cadres to bravely carry out self-revolution. For cadres who insisted on the proletarian revolutionary line and dared to rebel, we actively supported them, and through broadcasts, big-character posters, and other forms, cheered for their "coming out," established their prestige among the masses, and let them work boldly and freely.

In many meetings to struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, some cadres who made mistakes came out and rebelled against this handful of people. After testing, we combined with some leading cadres who firmly returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Through these works, the Party's policies were reflected, and many cadres who made mistakes received a great education. However, there were also a few cadres who, on the surface, leaned towards the proletarian revolutionary faction but secretly supported and fostered the conservatives. For these two-faced characters, we conducted serious criticism, let them continue to check themselves, and observe their future behavior. In this way, we united all forces that could be united and prevented bad elements from infiltrating.

Through a series of works, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership team was established, bringing a great situation to Shandong Institute of Technology.

First, the power was truly firmly grasped in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Because the revolutionary cadres were politically more mature, had stronger organizational abilities, and richer fighting experience, they combined with the revolutionary mass organizations, not only grasped the power well but also smashed the counter-revolutionary plot of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Second, it truly united the majority of cadres and masses. After the "three-in-one combination" seizure of power, the proletarian revolutionary faction quickly grew stronger. The majority of masses and cadres who were previously deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line began to awaken and fight back, returning to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. On this basis, the Revolutionary Committee convened three consecutive cadre meetings, explained the policies to them, and many cadres came out and exposed the problems of the handful of power-holders within the Institute Party Committee and the old Provincial Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road.

Third, the revolutionary new order began to be established. Under the joint participation of revolutionary cadres, the various levels of the Revolutionary Committee's organizations are becoming more and more complete and perfect. The proletarian revolutionary faction truly seized the power, and the work of "fighting the revolution and promoting production" began to show a new situation.

Fourth, it created good conditions for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in an organized manner. Because the Revolutionary Committee was established and improved at all levels of the institute, it overcame the shortcomings of various revolutionary organizations fighting independently, lack of concentration of forces, and poor coordination, thus providing extremely favorable conditions for thoroughly overthrowing, smashing, and exposing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and eliminating the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Fifth, it launched a vigorous mass rectification movement with the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the center. The proletarian revolutionary faction "fought while rectifying," launching a struggle against the "self" in their minds.

Shandong Institute of Technology was reborn. From this fierce class struggle, we deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse guiding us, the proletarian revolutionary faction, to victory. In the great winds and waves of class struggle, it is Chairman Mao who timely dispelled the fog for us and pointed out the direction. It is Chairman Mao who gave us endless wisdom and strength. At the critical moment, Chairman Mao timely guided us to overcome the various tricks and conspiracies of the class enemies, bypassing the shoals and reefs on the forward route; at the critical moment of the seizure of power struggle, it is Chairman Mao who proposed the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" for us, which is the fundamental guarantee for our victory in the seizure of power struggle.

    革命的“三结合”是夺权斗争胜利的保证
    山东工学院革命委员会
    毛主席提出，在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。
    毛主席及时为我们指明了方向。
    山东工学院革命学生、革命教职工和革命领导干部，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下实现“三结合”，于二月二十二日胜利地夺取了院党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，组成了新的全院临时权力机构——山东工学院革命委员会。
    夺权前的一段时间里，在对待干部问题上曾出现两种不正确的思想：有一些无产阶级革命派同志，在战斗中和一些革命领导干部结成了战斗的友谊，但是由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派煽阴风，点邪火，故意给一些革命领导干部抹黑脸，我们有些同志也受到了影响，怕和革命干部结合后被戴上“保皇”帽子。另有一些人受资产阶级反动路线的影响，不用阶级观点对干部作全面的分析，而是用形而上学的观点看待干部，怀疑一切，否定一切。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”根据这个道理，我们批判了上述两种错误思想。同时我们到群众中去调查研究，对我院干部作了初步分析，大致可以分四个类型：
    第一类，运动一开始就对资产阶级反动路线有所抵制，以后更坚决地执行了无产阶级革命路线，这些干部是党和人民的宝贵财富，是我们必须坚决依靠的力量。
    第二类，在运动中或运动前犯有一定的错误，并有所检查，但“怕”字当头，不敢公开支持左派。经过无产阶级革命派的帮助教育，后期态度比较明朗，这种干部是应该积极争取结合的。
    第三类，是犯有比较严重错误的干部，对他们要进一步交代政策，帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，勇敢地站出来。如果他们真心检查错误，改正错误，有些人也可以参加“三结合”的班子。
    第四类，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，必须坚决打倒。
    我们着重对前两类干部进行工作，特别是鼓励第二类干部勇敢地自我革命。对坚持无产阶级革命路线的干部和勇于站出来造反的干部，我们积极支持，通过广播、大字报等形式，为他们的“亮相”喝彩，在群众中为他们树立威信，让他们大胆放手工作。
    在好多次斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大会上，有些犯错误的干部出来亮相，造这一小撮人的反，经过考验，我们和一些坚决回到毛主席的革命路线上来的领导干部实行了结合。从这些工作中，体现了党的方针政策，对许多犯错误的干部是一个很大的教育。但是也有少数干部，表面上倾向无产阶级革命派，而暗中支持、扶植保守派，对这种两面派人物，则要进行严肃批评，让他们继续检查，以观后效。这样做，既团结了一切可以团结的力量，又防止了鱼目混珠、让不好的人混进来。
    通过一系列的工作，革命的“三结合”的领导班子建立起来了，给山东工学院带来一派大好形势。
    第一，真正把一切权力牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。由于革命领导干部政治上比较成熟，组织能力比较强，斗争经验比较丰富，他们和革命群众组织结合在一起，不仅掌好权，而且粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反夺权阴谋。
    第二，真正地团结了大多数的干部和群众。“三结合”夺权后，无产阶级革命派队伍迅速壮大，大多数过去受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众和干部开始醒悟，起来杀回马枪，回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。在此基础上，革命委员会连续召开了三次干部会议，向他们交代政策，许多干部纷纷站出来亮相，并且揭发院党委和旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的问题。
    第三，革命新秩序开始建立起来。在革命领导干部的共同参预下，革命委员会的各级机构正在日趋健全、完善，无产阶级革命派真正地掌了权，“抓革命，促生产”，各项工作开始出现了新局面。
    第四，为有计划地更好地进行斗、批、改创造了良好的条件。由于全院上下都建立和健全了革命委员会，就克服了各个革命组织各自为战，力量不集中，配合不密切的缺陷，从而为彻底地把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒提供了极有利的条件。
    第五，掀起了以活学活用毛主席著作为中心的轰轰烈烈的群众性整风运动。无产阶级革命派“一边战斗，一边整风”，向头脑中的“私”字展开了夺权斗争。
    山东工学院新生了。从这场激烈的阶级斗争中，我们深深地体会到，毛泽东思想是指引我们无产阶级革命派胜利前进的灯塔，在阶级斗争大风大浪中，是毛主席及时地为我们拨开迷雾，指明方向，是毛主席给我们无穷的智慧和力量。在关键时刻，毛主席及时指引我们战胜阶级敌人种种阴谋诡计，绕过前进航道上的种种险滩暗礁；在夺权斗争的关键时刻，又是毛主席为我们提出了革命的“三结合”的方针，这是我们夺权斗争取得胜利的根本保证。
