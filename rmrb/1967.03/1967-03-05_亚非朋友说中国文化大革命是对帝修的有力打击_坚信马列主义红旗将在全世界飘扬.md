Many friends from Asian and African countries have enthusiastically praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A Syrian friend wrote: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shattered the dreams of imperialism and revisionism that China would change its color. For this reason, the imperialists of the United States and Britain, along with the traitorous revisionists of the Khrushchev clique, have gone mad, engaging in hysterical slander, attacks, and defamation against the Chinese Cultural Revolution. However, the Chinese Cultural Revolution has made the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America firmly believe that the red flag of Marxism-Leninism will fly high all over the world."

The article states: "The Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong-led China is a powerful revolutionary base in the world, a strong pillar for the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and a major supporter of the Arab people's anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist struggle. She will march from victory to victory—this is also the victory of our Arab people."

A Tunisian friend recently wrote that the Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong is not only necessary in China but also has great international significance.

Daniel Samak, a railway representative from Mali in Dakar, and others recently wrote to the Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Dakar: "The Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, is promoting the revolution in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

A Congolese (Léopoldville) journalist said: "Despite the slanders by imperialists and modern revisionists against China's Cultural Revolution, the Cultural Revolution has attracted the hearts of the Congolese people, especially the Congolese youth."

He said: "We firmly believe that this Cultural Revolution will greatly inspire our struggle."

Two teachers from Somalia issued a written statement to Xinhua News Agency correspondents on February 18: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the contemporary Lenin—Chairman Mao—is the loudest call to every revolutionary fighter to carry the revolution through to the end."

The statement said: "We believe that the great Cultural Revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought will definitely achieve victory."

The statement also said: "China stands at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism. There is no doubt that all progressive forces and those fighting for liberation around the world support China's Cultural Revolution."

The statement concluded: "The victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is the victory of the liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and other regions of the world, and at the same time, it is a powerful blow to imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism."

    坚信马列主义红旗将在全世界飘扬
    新华社讯　许多亚非国家朋友热烈赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    一位叙利亚朋友著文说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命，打破了帝国主义和修正主义希望中国改变颜色的美梦。为此，美、英帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒们发了疯，他们一起对中国文化大革命进行歇斯底里的诬蔑、攻击和造谣中伤。但是中国文化大革命使亚非拉人民坚信马克思列宁主义的红旗将在全世界飘扬。”
    文章说：“中国共产党和毛泽东领导的中国，是世界强大的革命基地，是亚非拉人民斗争的有力支柱，也是阿拉伯人民反帝、反犹太复国主义斗争的主要支持者，她将从胜利走向胜利——这也是我们阿拉伯人民的胜利。”
    一位突尼斯朋友前不久撰文说，由毛泽东同志领导的这场文化大革命，不但在中国是必要的，而且也具有伟大的国际意义。
    马里在达喀尔的铁路代表达尼埃尔·萨马克等最近写信给新华社驻达喀尔记者说：“在毛泽东思想指导下进行的文化大革命正促进着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命。”
    一位刚果（利）新闻工作者说：“尽管帝国主义者和现代修正主义者对中国的文化大革命进行了种种诽谤，但是中国的文化大革命吸引了我们刚果人民，特别是刚果青年的心。”
    他说：“我们深信，这场文化大革命将在很大程度上鼓舞我们的斗争。”
    索马里两位教员二月十八日向新华社记者发表的书面声明说：“由当代列宁——毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命是对每个革命战士将革命进行到底的最响亮的号召。”
    声明说：“我们相信以毛泽东思想为指导的伟大的文化大革命一定能取得胜利。”
    声明还说：“中国是站在反对帝国主义斗争的最前列的。毫无疑问，全世界所有进步的和争取解放的力量都支持中国的文化大革命。”
    声明最后说：“中国文化大革命的胜利，是亚洲、非洲和世界其他地区解放运动的胜利，同时是对帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的有力打击。”
