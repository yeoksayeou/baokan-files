The PLA Arrives at Our Village
(Shandong Liuqin Performance)

Characters: Two old men.

	(Lively music starts. Two old men act as if they are carrying manure and enter the stage.)

	Both: (Singing) The rooster crows, the east brightens,
	The soldiers and civilians carry manure out of the village,
	The PLA marches ahead,
	We old men also want to follow closely.

	Ah, follow closely!
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	Old Man A: (Speaking) Old brother!
	Old Man B: Yes!
	Old Man A: There are many people!
	Old Man B: Indeed!
	Old Man A: The one leading is
	Old Man B: The political commissar.
	Old Man A: The one pushing the cart is
	Old Man B: Commander Zhang.
	Old Man A: The short one is
	Old Man B: Li Yonghong.
	Old Man A: The tall one is
	Old Man B: The second platoon leader.
	Old Man A: Today, the PLA comrades are leading the way.
	Old Man B: They have always led the way!

	(Singing) That day the PLA came to
	Our village,
	Carrying shovels and baskets,
	Marching a hundred miles without rest,
	Carrying full baskets of manure to the southern hill.

	Holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands,
	Ah, singing as they walk.
	(Singing as they walk),
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	Old Man A: (Speaking) What are they singing, old brother?
	Old Man B: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory"!

	(Singing) The PLA, a good example,
	In their hearts is a red sun;
	Grasp the revolution, promote production,
	Every word and sentence is remembered.
	As long as Chairman Mao says a word,
	Ah, they dare to brave fire and water!
	(Dare to brave fire and water),
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	Old Man B: (Singing) Their thoughts are red and their spirits high,
	Helping others is in their hearts;
	They spent money to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" for us,
	And a portrait of Chairman Mao.
	They helped me study the "Three Articles,"
	Ah, I understand clearly.
	(Clearly),
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	Old Man A: (Speaking) Do you know the "Three Articles" by heart, old brother?
	Old Man B: Not only do I know them by heart, but I also know how to use them!
	Old Man A: You're not simple, old brother!
	Old Man B: I still have a long way to go!

	(Singing) We have no education and learn slowly,
	They never get tired,
	They lecture and read,
	Teaching over and over again.
	They have a saying:
	Ah, to make the whole earth red.
	(To make the whole earth red),
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	Old Man B: (Singing) The PLA comrades are disciplined,
	Each one can sing and compose;
	Wherever they go, they sing,
	They propagate the revolutionary line.
	They sing and make my heart bright and clear,
	Ah, the revolutionary principles are in my heart.
	(In my heart),
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	Old Man A: (Speaking) What are they singing, old brother?
	Old Man B: "Grasp the revolution, promote production," and this is called what... right, "Three-in-One Combination."
	Old Man A: These are all proposed by Chairman Mao.
	Old Man B: Proposed well!
	Both: Very well!

	(Singing) The "Three-in-One Combination" policy is truly brilliant,
	The revolution is guaranteed to win;
	Revolutionary cadres, the PLA, and us together,
	Our revolutionary leftists stand tall.
	The official seal is in our hands,
	Ah, the ghosts and snakes do not dare to move!
	(Do not dare to move),
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	Old Man B: (Singing) I want to learn from the PLA,
	Study the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" diligently;
	Carry two heavy burdens on one shoulder,
	Follow Chairman Mao in the revolution.
	Achieve a bumper harvest of cotton and grain this year,
	Ah, the PLA's great merit.
	(A great merit),
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	Old Man A: (Speaking) Oh! Old brother, the PLA comrades have walked far ahead!
	Old Man B: Let's go, catch up!
	Both: (Singing) The soldiers and civilians are united,
	Attack and win, fight and win,
	Forever follow Chairman Mao,
	The country will be red for ten thousand years.
	(For ten thousand years),
	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

	(Speaking) "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory."
	(Gradually faster)
	(Chase off stage.)
