    Stand tall and come forward. Cadres who have made various mistakes must first turn to the left, changing their previous stance of opposition to the masses, and aligning themselves with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. This turning to the left is a fundamental change in stance, the first step necessary to come forward. Once the stance is changed, aligning with the direction of the proletarian revolutionary masses, sharing the same thoughts and feelings, there will be a common love and hate, forming the basis for unity.

    To stand tall and come forward, one must also put down the burden on one's back. "Putting down the burden" means that we should rid ourselves of many spiritual burdens. Many things, if we are blind to them and lack self-awareness, can become our burdens, our obstacles. For example, having made mistakes can make one feel that one is forever a mistake-maker, leading to a state of listlessness and inaction; ...

    All cadres who have made mistakes should firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, raise their revolutionary consciousness, and resolutely break with the bourgeois reactionary line.

    Some comrades who have made mistakes still lack this self-awareness. They do not proactively put down their burdens but instead sigh and fret all day, unsure of what to do, saying, "I don't have the conditions to come forward, do I?" The condition is just one: do you want to continue the revolution? As long as you want to continue the revolution, as long as you do not cover up your illnesses and fear treatment, as long as you believe in the masses and in the Party, you have the conditions to come forward, and you will be welcomed by the masses.

    Water has a source, trees have roots. The original source of mistakes was the "self," and today, the root of countless worries and fears about not coming forward is still the "self." The "self" is the root of all evil. If we do not overcome the "self," we cannot liberate ourselves, completely rid ourselves of the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line, stand tall, and come forward.

    挺起腰杆站出来
    新青
    犯有这样那样错误的领导干部，要挺起腰杆站出来，首先要向左转，扭转以前和群众对立的地位，和无产阶级革命派站到一个方向上来。这个向左转，是一个立场的根本转变，是站出来所必须迈出的第一步。立场转变过来了，和无产阶级革命派方向一致了，思想感情一致了，就有了和革命派共同的爱和憎，就有了团结的基础。
    要挺起腰杆站出来，还必须放下背上的包袱。“所谓放下包袱，就是说，我们精神上的许多负担应该加以解除。有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。例如：犯过错误，可以使人觉得自己反正是犯了错误的，从此萎靡不振；……”一切犯了错误的干部，应该牢记毛主席的这一伟大教导，提高革命的自觉性，下定决心，同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂。
    有的犯错误的同志还缺乏这种自觉性，他们不主动地放下背上的包袱，却整天长吁短叹，惶惶然不知所措，说：“我不具备站出来的条件吧？”条件吗？就是一条：看你愿意不愿意继续革命？只要你愿意继续革命，只要你不讳疾忌医，只要你相信群众和相信党，你就具备了站出来的条件，你就会受到群众的欢迎。
    水有源，树有根。当初犯错误的根源就是“私”字，今天千思万虑，不敢站出来的根源仍是一个“私”字。“私”字是万恶之源，不打倒“私”字，就不可能自己解放自己，彻底摆脱资产阶级反动路线的束缚，挺起腰杆站出来。
