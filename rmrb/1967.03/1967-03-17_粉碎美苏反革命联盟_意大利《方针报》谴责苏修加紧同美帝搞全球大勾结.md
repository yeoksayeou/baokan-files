According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 16th, a message from Rome: The Italian newspaper "Linea Politica" published an article titled "On the U.S.-Soviet Alliance" in its first and second combined issues of this year. The article condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership for betraying the revolutionary people of the world and increasingly colluding with American imperialism on a global scale.

The article states: "The fundamental goal of the Soviet foreign policy is: to cooperate with the United States and betray the revolutionary forces of the entire world." The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership's policy of "peaceful competition" and "peaceful coexistence" is essentially a betrayal of the socialist revolution, reaching an agreement with American imperialism to jointly divide the world. The article also points out that the contradictions between the Soviet revisionist leadership and American imperialism have undergone a fundamental change. Now, these contradictions have become "contradictions between two bourgeois powers competing for prestige, military superiority, and engaging in economic competition."

The article further exposes the Soviet revisionist leadership's increasing collusion with American imperialism in various aspects. The article states that from Khrushchev's visit to the United States to the present, "imitating American experience to the greatest extent possible has become the most fashionable thing (in the Soviet Union)." "Cultural exchanges are becoming more frequent, and 'the American way of life' is infiltrating into Soviet society."

The article points out that to further collude with American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership is actively cooperating with the U.S. to suppress the Vietnamese people's resistance against aggression. The article states: "The Soviets have repeatedly said and want us to believe that 'if it were not for Vietnam, commercial and trade relations between the United States and the Soviet Union would increase, and there would be no friction in the relations between the two countries.'"

The article points out that the Soviet policy towards Europe is also entirely to adapt to the needs of the two countries' collusion. The article states that in European policy, the Soviets advocate "European security." "What is behind 'European security'? Firstly, it is an agreement with the United States (to) ease political and military tensions so that they can jointly deal with China on the Asian continent. This cooperation has already allowed the United States to transfer several divisions stationed in (West) Germany to Vietnam." "The Soviet Union pursues a policy of 'peaceful coexistence' with Western European countries, signing commercial trade agreements and exchanging scientific and technological experiences... Therefore, 'European security' is also the security of the Soviet big merchants and the capitalists of France, Italy, and other countries." "(The Soviet Union) wants to use this policy to extort the maximum from the European working class, making the working class content with their respective 'welfare,' leaving the task of fighting against the exploiters to the people of the 'underdeveloped' countries."

The article points out: "The Soviet European policy and the policy of the revisionist Communist parties, which take 'European security' and the 'peaceful path' as their theoretical basis, are direct support for American imperialism and are a genuine betrayal of the revolutionary forces in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

The article also exposes the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with American imperialism to support the reactionaries in various countries. The article uses India as an example, stating: "India has already become one of the outposts of American imperialism. The Indian bourgeoisie, represented by the Congress Party, is carrying out brutal exploitation of the people of this country, causing people to die of hunger. The only way for the Indian people to get rid of poverty is through revolution. For many years, the Soviet leadership has provided the Indian government with a large amount of economic aid, which has strengthened the government's power. Not only that, today, India plays a special role in opposing China in the U.S. strategy, especially in the military aspect. In the iron chain that the United States has set up around the People's Republic of China, India is a fairly important link. The Soviet Union not only shamefully supported India in its provocations against China under the pretext of the so-called 'border issue,' but also further provided military aid to India."

The article concludes by pointing out that the Soviet revisionist leadership's so-called "peaceful coexistence," "European security," and "aid" are all reactionary slogans. Behind these slogans, "there is a hidden consistency in the Soviet and American (attempts) to rule the world." The article calls on every revolutionary to stand up against the Soviet revisionist leadership's treacherous policy of colluding with American imperialism.

### 粉碎美苏反革命联盟  意大利《方针报》谴责苏修加紧同美帝搞全球大勾结

    粉碎美苏反革命联盟
    意大利《方针报》谴责苏修加紧同美帝搞全球大勾结
    据新华社十六日讯　罗马消息：意大利《方针报》在今年第一、二期合刊上发表一篇题为《论美苏联盟》的文章，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团背叛全世界革命人民，越来越加紧进行同美帝国主义的全球大勾结。
    文章说：“苏联对外政策的根本目标是：同美国合作，背叛全世界革命力量。”文章指出，苏修领导集团的“和平竞赛”、“和平共处”政策，实质上就是背叛社会主义革命，同美帝国主义达成协议，共同来瓜分世界。文章还指出，苏修领导集团和美帝国主义之间的矛盾已经起了根本的变化，现在这种矛盾已经变成“两个资产阶级列强争夺威信、军事优势、进行经济竞争的矛盾”。
    文章接着揭露了苏修领导集团在各方面加紧同美帝国主义进行勾结。文章说，从赫鲁晓夫访美发展到现在，“尽最大可能模仿美国的经验已经成了（苏联）最时髦的东西”。“文化交流越来越频繁，‘美国的生活方式’渗透到苏联的社会内部。”
    文章指出，苏修领导集团为了进一步同美帝国主义勾结，正在积极配合美帝来扑灭越南人民反抗侵略的战火。文章说：“苏联人不止一次地这样说，并要我们相信这一说法：‘如果不是越南，美国和苏联之间的商业和贸易将会增加，两国关系中就不会有任何摩擦的因素。’”
    文章指出，苏联对欧洲的政策，也完全是为了适应两国勾结的需要。文章说，苏联在欧洲政策方面鼓吹“欧洲安全”，“在‘欧洲安全’后面是什么东西呢？首先是同美国达成协议，（双方）解除政治和军事上的紧张，以便在亚洲大陆共同对付中国。这种合作已经使美国能够把几个驻在（西）德的师调到了越南。”“苏联奉行同西欧国家‘和平’相处的政策，签订商业贸易协定和交换科学技术经验的协定……，因此，‘欧洲安全’也就是苏联的巨商大贾同法国、意大利等国的资本家的安全。”“（苏联）想通过这个政策对欧洲的工人阶级进行最大的讹诈，要工人阶级安于他们各自的‘福利’，把反对剥削者的斗争任务留给‘不发达’国家的人民。”
    文章指出：“苏联的欧洲政策和修正主义共产党以‘欧洲安全’和‘和平道路’为理论根据的政策，是对美帝国主义的直接支持，并且是名副其实地背叛了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命力量。”
    文章还揭露苏修领导集团伙同美帝国主义支持各国反动派。文章举印度为例说：“印度今天已经成了美帝国主义的前哨之一。以国大党为代表的印度资产阶级对这个国家的人民群众进行残酷的剥削，使人民饥饿而死。印度人民摆脱贫困的唯一出路就是进行革命。多年来，苏联领导集团却给了印度政府大量的经济援助，这些援助加强了这个政府的政权。不仅如此，今天，印度在美国的战略中起着反对中国的特别作用，首先是在军事方面。在美国围绕中华人民共和国设置的一个铁链中，印度是相当重要的一环。苏联不仅在印度借口所谓‘边界问题’向中国进行的挑衅中可耻地支持了印度，而且还进一步向印度提供军事援助。”
    文章最后指出，苏联修正主义领导集团的所谓“和平共处”、“欧洲安全”和“援助”，都是一些反动的口号，在这些口号的背后，“隐藏着苏美（企图）统治世界的一致性”。文章号召每一个革命者起来反对苏联修正主义领导集团加紧勾结美帝国主义的叛卖政策。
