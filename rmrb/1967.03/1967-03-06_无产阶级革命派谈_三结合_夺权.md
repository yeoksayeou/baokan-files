After the "three-in-one" seizure of power, there are thousands and tens of thousands of things to do. However, the most fundamental task is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the revolutionaries.

What is the authority of the proletariat? The highest authority of the proletariat is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the highest authority of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionaries must go among the masses, humbly learn from them, and share their fate. Only in this way can they understand what the masses think and what their demands are. Only in this way can they follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line closely.

After the proletarian revolutionaries seize power, they must continually revolutionize their own minds, eliminate the "self" within, carry out rectification, and further promote the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat to carry the revolution through to the end.

Cadres coming forward mainly rely on themselves, on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and on transforming their thinking. Once their thinking is clear, things will be easier. At the same time, the proletarian revolutionaries must do meticulous ideological work with the cadres. They must address living thoughts and encourage and help them to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as soon as possible.

Are we going to be full of revolutionary vigor, be revolutionary forever, and never change? Or are we going to rest on our past achievements, be self-satisfied, and stop progressing? Every revolutionary must answer this question with their actual actions.

To constantly improve our art of struggle, we must not just rely on fierce attacks and be infatuated with spectacular scenes, neglecting meticulous political and ideological work. We must not neglect the study of the Party's policies and guidelines, and neglect our own ideological transformation.

The discipline of the bourgeoisie is to maintain bourgeois interests and is counter-revolutionary discipline. The discipline of the proletariat is based on the interests of the proletariat and the working people and is revolutionary discipline. We must resolutely smash the counter-revolutionary discipline of the bourgeoisie and consciously observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat.

    无产阶级革命派谈“三结合”夺权
    “三结合”夺权以后，有千件事、万件事要做，但是最根本的一件大事是活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装革命派的头脑。
    什么是无产阶级的权威？无产阶级最高的权威就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。以毛主席为代表的革命路线，是无产阶级文化大革命的最高权威。
    掌权后的无产阶级革命派必须到群众中去，恭恭敬敬地做群众的小学生，和群众同呼吸共命运，这样才能知道群众想些什么，群众的要求是什么。这样才能紧跟毛主席的革命路线。
    无产阶级革命派夺权以后，只有不断革自己头脑里“私”字的命，不断整风，进一步发扬无产阶级革命精神，才能将革命进行到底。
    干部站出来，主要靠自己，靠活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想。思想通了，就好办。同时，无产阶级革命派必须对干部做细致的思想工作。抓好活思想，鼓励和帮助他们早日站到毛主席的革命路线一边来。
    是革命干劲充沛，永远革命，永不变质，还是躺在过去的成绩上沾沾自喜，停步不前？每一个革命者必须以自己的实际行动做出严肃的回答。
    我们要不断提高斗争艺术，就不能光靠猛冲猛打，醉心于轰轰烈烈的大场面，而不愿作艰苦细致的政治思想工作；就不能忽视党的方针政策的学习，忽视自己的思想改造。
    资产阶级的纪律，是维护资产阶级利益的，是反革命的纪律。无产阶级的纪律，是以无产阶级和劳动人民的利益为出发点的，是革命的纪律。我们必须坚决粉碎资产阶级的反革命纪律，自觉遵守无产阶级的革命纪律。
