The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 18, protesting in the strongest terms the Ministry's alteration of the name of the People's Republic of China to "Zhina People's Republic" on the envelope of a document delivered to the Chinese Embassy on March 14. The note pointed out that this is a blatant insult and serious provocation by the Indonesian government against the People's Republic of China. The Embassy expressed great indignation over this. The note demanded that the Indonesian government immediately issue a public apology and ensure that such incidents do not occur again. Otherwise, the Indonesian government must bear all the consequences that arise from this.

The note also pointed out that on March 6 of this year, the Embassy had sent a note to the Indonesian government protesting in the strongest terms and making serious demands regarding similar provocations by the leadership of Indonesia's "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly" against the People's Republic of China. In response, you not only failed to issue a public apology but also, a few days later, publicly and maliciously insulted the great People's Republic of China. This is obviously a planned provocation against the Chinese people and another serious step in your deliberate attempt to sabotage relations between the two countries. Your underhanded tactics can only expose your anti-China ugliness and cannot harm the great image of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Your despicable anti-China and anti-Chinese actions will ultimately backfire!

    印尼政府竟公然篡改我国国名
    我大使馆提出最强烈抗议
    新华社二十二日讯　中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十八日照会印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚外交部十四日在送交中国大使馆一份文件的信封上，公然把中华人民共和国的国名，篡改为“支那人民共和国”，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会指出这是印度尼西亚政府明目张胆地对中华人民共和国的侮辱和严重的挑衅。对此，大使馆表示十分愤慨。照会要求印度尼西亚政府立即公开道歉，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。否则，印度尼西亚政府必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
    照会还指出，今年三月六日，大使馆曾就印度尼西亚“临时人民协商会议”领导层对中华人民共和国的类似挑衅，照会印尼政府，提出了最严重的抗议和严正的要求。对此，你们不仅没有公开道歉，反而在数日之后，由印度尼西亚政府公开出面恶毒地侮辱伟大的中华人民共和国，这显然是你们对中国人民有计划的挑衅，是蓄意破坏两国关系的又一严重步骤。你们这种鬼蜮伎俩只能赤裸裸地暴露你们反华的丑恶嘴脸，丝毫损伤不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的伟大形象。你们反华、排华的一切卑劣行径，到头来只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚！
