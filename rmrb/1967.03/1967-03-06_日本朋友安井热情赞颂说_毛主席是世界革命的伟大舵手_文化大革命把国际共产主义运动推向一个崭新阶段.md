Japanese friend Anzai Yoshiyuki, who recently returned from visiting China, spoke with great emotion, saying that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the great helmsman of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun that illuminates the entire world. This is the happiness of the Chinese people and also the happiness of the people of the world.

Anzai Yoshiyuki told a Chinese reporter that each time he visits China, his love for the great leader Chairman Mao deepens, and his reverence for Mao Zedong Thought grows stronger.

Anzai said, Chairman Mao is a great leader with extremely rich experience. Chairman Mao has comprehensively summarized the experiences of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, developing Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. Anzai said, all of Chairman Mao's works possess an incredibly powerful vitality. The revolutionary struggles of today's world prove the boundless vitality of Mao Zedong Thought. In today's world, to solve revolutionary problems, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought.

When talking about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, Anzai highly praised Chairman Mao's new and major contributions to enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism, as well as the immeasurable international significance of this great revolution.

He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, like the great October Socialist Revolution, has extremely great significance in the history of the international communist movement. This great revolution has made tremendous contributions to Marxism-Leninism in both theory and practice, and has pushed the international communist movement to a new stage. Anzai said, this further proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the whole world.

Anzai emphasized that in the world, only Chairman Mao could initiate and lead such a great revolution. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has always developed in the correct direction.

He said, in this great revolution, the creativity of the masses has been fully brought into play. Revolutionary workers, peasants, youth, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in China have achieved great successes in mastering and applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He said, in the history of the international communist movement, there has never been a time like now where such a broad revolutionary mass has mastered Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This is a major contribution to the international communist movement.

Anzai emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. It has shattered the imperialists' hopes of "peaceful evolution" placed on the younger generation in China.

    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命在国际共产主义运动的历史上，同伟大的十月社会主义革命一样具有极其伟大的意义，这场大革命无论在理论上或实践上都对马克思列宁主义做出了巨大的贡献，并且把国际共产主义运动推向一个崭新的阶段。安井说，这进一步证明，毛泽东思想是全世界人民进行革命斗争的指导思想。
