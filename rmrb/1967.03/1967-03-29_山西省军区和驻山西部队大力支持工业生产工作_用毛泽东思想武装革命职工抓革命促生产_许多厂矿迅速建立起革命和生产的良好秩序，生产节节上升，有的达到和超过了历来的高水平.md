The Shanxi Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi have strongly supported industrial production work. They have armed revolutionary workers with Mao Zedong Thought to promote revolution and production. Many factories and mines have quickly established a good order of revolution and production, with production steadily rising, and some reaching or exceeding their historical high levels.

The People's Liberation Army Shanxi Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left, have, since January when the Shanxi Provincial "three-in-one combination" took power, planned and stepped up efforts to assist the local authorities in supporting industrial production work. They have made remarkable achievements and created some experiences in assisting the revolutionary masses in factories and mines to promote revolution and production. After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories and Mines," they immediately summarized the work of the previous period, made further arrangements, and decided to assist the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in factories and mines to carry out Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great call, to achieve a double victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial production.

The leading organs of the Shanxi Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi, after the Shanxi proletarian revolutionary masses seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former provincial committee, jointly studied with the Shanxi Provincial provisional power organ and dispatched troops to assist in the work of railways, power plants, water supply, and other factories and mines. In early March, they made a comprehensive arrangement for supporting industrial production work. They implemented the principle of focusing on key points while considering the overall situation, dispatching troops to some key factories and mines related to the national economy and people's livelihood, such as coal, steel, national defense, transportation, telecommunications, and chemical fertilizers, to directly assist in the work. At the same time, military sub-districts and county armed departments dispatched personnel to assist local factories and mines in promoting revolution and production. To strengthen leadership, the Shanxi Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi have their main responsible comrades in charge. They also held short-term training classes to organize the officers and soldiers going to the factories to study documents and grasp policies.

All work is guided by Mao Zedong Thought

The officers and soldiers assisting in factories and mines all hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and all work is guided by Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as they enter the factories, they vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought and persistently arm the revolutionary workers with Mao Zedong Thought. They correctly handled the relationship between revolution and production, insisting on using revolution to lead production and using revolution to promote production. They firmly rely on the leftists, insist on the mass line, and mobilize the masses. Their goal is to assist factories and mines in achieving double victories in revolution and production and gradually turn the enterprises into big schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "It is necessary to learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to infuse Chairman Mao's thoughts into the workers and peasants, to change the spiritual outlook of the working people, and to transform spiritual strength into tremendous material force." The broad officers and soldiers of the Shanxi Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi, in accordance with Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, as soon as they step into the factories and mines, go deep into the workshops, mines, teams, dormitories, and canteens, actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and help the workers to learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle.

The former committee of the Taiyuan First Thermal Power Plant had, for a long time, used various means to oppose and resist Mao Zedong Thought, even forbidding workers from bringing Chairman Mao's books into the workshop. Whoever recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations during rest time was scolded as "violating labor discipline." After the PLA officers and soldiers entered the factory, they helped the revolutionary workers set up blackboards and quotation boards; they wrote more than six hundred and sixty quotations from Chairman Mao, pinpointing the problems in the factory's revolution and production, and the active thoughts of the workers and cadres, and posted them everywhere; they vigorously organized the workers to read Chairman Mao's books. The entire factory saw an unprecedented atmosphere of learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works. The officers and soldiers assisting in the Datong Coal Mine brought "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Party Central Committee documents on the Cultural Revolution into the mine and worked with the workers. During rest time, they studied together. The PLA officers and soldiers assisting in the Taiyuan Thirteenth Metallurgical Construction Company and the Taiyuan Railway Bureau all held short-term training classes to study Chairman Mao's works. The officers and soldiers of the troops and the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres participating in the training classes studied together, discussed while learning, and exposed their thoughts, learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice. The workers and cadres participating in the study all felt that the training class "was short in time but great in harvest."

Firmly rely on the revolutionary forces and insist on the mass line

After the broad officers and soldiers arrived at the factories and mines, they paid attention to investigation and research work. As soon as they discovered revolutionary leftist organizations, they stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary leftists in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, actively and enthusiastically supporting and helping them. The comrades from the troops supported the leftists first in their political and ideological work, helping them to learn and grasp Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies. Then, relying on them, they mobilized the masses, educating themselves and liberating themselves.

After a certain unit of the PLA arrived at the Shanxi Provincial Coal Management Bureau, they found that there were still phenomena of the masses fighting against the masses, while a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were sitting on the mountain watching the tigers fight. They organized members of the two relevant revolutionary mass organizations to study Party policies, using the perspective of class struggle and the method of class analysis to analyze problems and hold debates. Through the debate, the problem became clear, and it turned out that a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were instigating from behind, trying to protect themselves. After these two organizations of revolutionary masses saw through the tricks of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they united and jointly fought against the enemy. They mobilized all the revolutionary workers in the bureau, directing the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The problem of chaotic production command caused by the opposition of the two factions was also solved. In the revolutionary mass organizations of the Taiyuan First Thermal Power Plant, some people had some wrong understandings about the cadre issue. The troops entering the factory helped them study Chairman Mao's expositions on cadre policy and relevant editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine. They realized: "It is necessary to be able to distinguish cadres. Not only should one look at a cadre's one-time one-event, but also look at a cadre's entire history and entire work." They realized that they could not replace policies with personal feelings and could not indiscriminately exclude and overthrow everything. On the basis of raising their awareness, the revolutionary forces actively did the work of revolutionary cadres, and the revolutionary cadres also actively stood out to revolutionize, achieving the "three-in-one combination" of revolution in the entire factory. The comrades from the PLA also helped many units' revolutionary mass organizations to carry out rectification movements, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the workers. On the basis of rectification, many factories and mines' revolutionary forces achieved great unity by department and unit.

The officers and soldiers assisting in factories and mines also helped the revolutionary forces to dissolve reactionary organizations and did ideological and political work for the deceived masses, winning over and uniting the majority of the workers. The PLA assisting in the Datong Mining Bureau, in accordance with the characteristics of coal miners who suffered greatly in the old society, cooperated with the revolutionary forces of various mines to organize workers to recall bitterness and think sweetly through various meetings, vigorously carrying out class education. The workers recalled the bitterness of the old society and at the same time recalled the bitterness of being poisoned by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, making many deceived masses raise their class consciousness. The PLA and the revolutionary forces in the mine also helped them to learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works, finally making these people draw a clear line with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Some people who left their production posts returned, and those who were passive about production also became active.

Bringing political work experience into factories and mines

After the broad officers and soldiers arrived at the factories and mines, they also paid attention to spreading the experience of the PLA's political work to the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres. The officers of the troops assisting in the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, when talking with the comrades of the frontline command post for promoting revolution and production, found that some comrades saw the objective difficulties in completing the March production plan more seriously, so they studied with them a passage from Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Protracted War": "The commanders of war cannot exceed the limit allowed by objective conditions to seek victory in war, but they can and must actively seek victory in war within the limit of objective conditions. The stage for the activities of war commanders must be built on the basis of the allowance of objective conditions, but they can, relying on this stage, perform many colorful and magnificent dramas." Through the study, they raised their awareness and further mobilized the masses to analyze the unfavorable and favorable conditions for completing the plan and actively find ways to overcome difficulties.

The broad officers and soldiers regarded assisting in factories and mines to promote revolution and production as a classroom for learning from the working class and as a furnace for tempering themselves in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. After arriving at the factories and mines, they ate, lived, worked, studied, and struggled with the revolutionary workers, always demanding high standards of themselves.

The Shanxi Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi have already helped many factories and mines to advance the Cultural Revolution to a deeper stage, helping them to quickly establish a good revolutionary order. Many factories and mines have seen a surge in learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works. The spiritual outlook of the broad workers has changed significantly. Production is steadily rising. The current daily production level of the Datong Coal Mine is much higher than before the PLA entered the mine, has exceeded the state's daily production target, and has reached a historically rare high level. The February electricity generation of the Taiyuan First Thermal Power Plant was 39% higher than the same period last year, creating a new record since its operation. (Accompanying pictures)

    山西省军区和驻山西部队大力支持工业生产工作
    用毛泽东思想武装革命职工抓革命促生产
    许多厂矿迅速建立起革命和生产的良好秩序，生产节节上升，有的达到和超过了历来的高水平
    本报讯　人民解放军山西省军区和驻山西部队，遵照伟大统帅毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的指示，从一月份山西省实现革命的“三结合”联合夺权以后，就有计划有步骤地大力协助地方，支持工业生产工作。他们在支援厂矿企业无产阶级革命派抓革命促生产方面，做出了显著成绩，创造了一些经验。《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》发表以后，他们又立即总结前一段的工作，做了进一步的部署，决心协助厂矿企业革命职工和革命干部，贯彻执行毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，夺取无产阶级文化大革命和工业生产的双丰收。
    山西省军区和驻山西部队的领导机关，在山西省无产阶级革命派夺了前省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，就同山西省临时权力机构共同研究，派出部队，到铁路、发电、自来水等厂矿企业协助工作。三月上旬，又对支持工业生产的工作做了全面安排。他们实行了抓重点照顾面的原则，一方面根据毛主席关于抓主要矛盾和集中兵力打歼灭战的教导，向一些有关国计民生的煤炭、钢铁、国防、交通、电讯、化肥等重点厂矿企业派出部队，直接协助工作，一方面由军分区、县武装部派出人员协助地方厂矿企业抓革命，促生产。为了加强领导，山西省军区和驻山西部队都有主要负责同志挂帅。他们还分别举办了短期训练班，组织下厂的干部战士学习文件，掌握政策。
    一切工作以毛泽东思想为指针
    到厂矿企业协助工作的指战员都高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一切工作都以毛泽东思想为指针。他们一进厂，就大力宣传毛泽东思想，坚持不懈地用毛泽东思想武装革命职工的头脑。他们正确处理了革命和生产的关系，坚持以革命统帅生产，用革命带动生产。他们坚定地依靠左派，坚持走群众路线，放手发动群众。他们的努力目标是协助厂矿企业夺取革命、生产双胜利，逐步把企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    林彪同志指出：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”山西省军区和驻山西部队广大指战员，根据林彪同志这一指示，一踏进厂矿企业的大门，就深入车间、矿井、班组、宿舍、食堂，积极宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，帮助职工在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。
    太原第一热电厂前党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来千方百计地反对和抵制毛泽东思想，甚至不准工人把毛主席的书带进工房，谁要是在休息时间念一段毛主席语录，他们就斥为“违反劳动纪律”。解放军干部战士进厂以后，帮助革命职工办起了黑板报、语录牌；针对厂里革命和生产中的问题，针对工人和干部中的活思想，写了六百六十多条毛主席语录，到处张贴；大力组织职工读毛主席的书。全厂出现了前所未有的活学活用毛主席著作的浓厚空气。到大同煤矿协助工作的指战员，带着《毛主席语录》、党中央关于文化大革命的文件，下矿井和工人一起劳动，休息时间就一起学习。到太原十三冶金建设公司和到太原铁路分局的解放军，都办了学习毛主席著作的短期训练班。部队指战员和参加训练班的革命职工、革命干部一起学习，边学，边议，边亮思想，活学活用。参加学习的职工、干部都认为训练班“时间不长，收获不小”。
    坚决依靠革命派，坚持走群众路线
    广大指战员到达厂矿企业以后，就重视调查研究工作，一经发现革命左派组织，就遵照毛主席的指示，坚决站在革命左派一边，积极热情地支持、帮助他们。部队的同志支持左派，首先是从政治思想上支持他们，帮助他们学习、掌握毛泽东思想，掌握党的政策。然后，依靠他们，放手发动群众，自己教育自己，自己解放自己。
    解放军某部到山西省煤炭管理局以后，发现还有群众斗群众的现象，而党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却坐山观虎斗。他们就组织有关的两个革命群众组织的成员学习党的政策，用阶级斗争的观点、阶级分析的方法分析问题，开展辩论。经过辩论，问题清楚了，原来是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派背后在挑拨离间，企图保护自己过关。这两个组织的革命群众识破了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋后，就团结起来，共同对敌。他们发动全局革命职工，把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。原来由于两派对立而造成的生产指挥紊乱的问题也解决了。太原第一热电厂革命群众组织中，有的人在对待干部问题上曾有一些错误认识。进厂部队帮助他们学习了毛主席关于干部政策的论述和《红旗》杂志的有关社论。他们认识到：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”。他们认识到，不能拿感想代替政策，不能不分青红皂白，排斥一切，打倒一切。在认识提高的基础上，革命派积极做革命干部的工作，革命干部也积极站出来革命，全厂实现了革命的“三结合”。解放军同志还帮助许多单位的革命群众组织开展了整风运动，促进了职工的思想革命化。在整风的基础上，许多厂矿企业的革命派实现了按部门按单位的大联合。
    到厂矿企业协助工作的指战员，还帮助革命派瓦解反动组织，对受蒙蔽的群众做思想政治工作，争取和团结大多数职工群众。到大同矿务局的解放军，根据煤矿工人在旧社会苦大仇深的特点，协同各矿革命派，利用各种会议，组织职工忆苦思甜，大力开展阶级教育。职工们诉旧社会的苦，同时诉受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派毒害的苦，使许多受蒙蔽的群众提高了阶级觉悟。解放军和矿上的革命派还帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，终于使这些人同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线划清了界限，回到毛主席的革命路线一边。一些离开生产岗位的人回来了，生产消极的也积极起来了。
    把政治工作经验带进厂矿
    广大指战员到厂矿企业以后，还注意向革命职工和革命干部传播解放军做政治工作的经验。到太原铁路分局的部队干部，在和这个局的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部的同志谈话时，发现有些同志对完成三月份生产计划的客观困难看得重一些，就和他们一起学习毛主席在《论持久战》这篇光辉著作中的一段话：“指导战争的人们不能超越客观条件许可的限度期求战争的胜利，然而可以而且必须在客观条件的限度之内，能动地争取战争的胜利。战争指挥员活动的舞台，必须建筑在客观条件的许可之上，然而他们凭借这个舞台，却可以导演出很多有声有色、威武雄壮的戏剧来。”通过学习，使他们提高了认识，进一步去发动群众，分析完成计划的不利条件和有利条件，积极想办法克服困难。
    广大指战员把到厂矿企业帮助抓革命、促生产，当作向工人阶级学习的课堂，当作投身到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中锻炼自己的熔炉。他们到达厂矿以后，和革命职工同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗争，处处用高标准要求自己。
    山西省军区和驻山西部队已经帮助许多厂矿把文化大革命运动推进到更深入的阶段，帮助他们迅速建立起良好的革命秩序。许多厂矿出现了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。广大职工的精神面貌发生了显著变化。生产步步上升。大同煤矿现在的日产水平，比解放军进矿以前有很大提高，已经超过国家规定的日产指标，达到了历史上少有的高水平。太原第一热电厂二月份的发电量比去年同期提高百分之三十九，创造了投产以来的最高纪录。（附图片）
