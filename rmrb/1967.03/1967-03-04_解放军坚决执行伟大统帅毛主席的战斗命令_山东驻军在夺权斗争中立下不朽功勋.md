The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong resolutely executes the great commander Chairman Mao's battle orders. The Shandong garrison has made immortal contributions in the struggle for power.

	New China News Agency, Jinan, March 3rd—The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong responded to the great commander Chairman Mao's battle call, holding high the banner and taking a firm stand. They wholeheartedly support and aid the proletarian revolutionary factions in seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shandong Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee. They actively participate in the "three-in-one combination," and together with the proletarian revolutionary factions, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they have smashed the repeated counterattacks launched by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who colluded with the ghosts and snakes in society and reactionary organizations. They played a decisive role in the victory of the power struggle and have made new immortal contributions.

	At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide has entered a new stage of great unity among the proletarian revolutionary factions and the seizure of power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, our great commander Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses. The entire cadre and soldiers of the Shandong garrison enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, unanimously expressing that this is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest care, greatest trust, and greatest encouragement for us. Our army has always been infinitely loyal to the people, breathing the same breath, sharing the same fate, and having hearts connected. In this severe class struggle, we must resolutely execute the great commander Chairman Mao's battle orders, wholeheartedly and unhesitatingly support and aid the proletarian revolutionary factions to seize power. The military leadership dispatched a large number of cadres to form a powerful command structure to support the proletarian revolutionary factions in seizing power, and sent cadres to extensively contact and liaise with various revolutionary rebel organizations, conduct in-depth investigations and research, and strongly support the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions. The broad cadre and soldiers also seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions and made all preparations for battle.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." Just as the proletarian revolutionary army of the "three-in-one combination" launched a bottom-up power struggle, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party stirred up trouble, engaging in fake seizures of power and counter-seizures of power. They incited a handful of counter-revolutionaries to control organizations, attack revolutionary organizations. The handful of counter-revolutionaries who manipulated the so-called "Shandong Provincial Workers' Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters" carried out a series of attacks and sabotage against revolutionary mass organizations. They rushed into some government agencies, factories, and enterprises, smashing and looting, and rushed into the provincial public security bureau controlled by the proletarian revolutionary factions, destroying the archives room, beating and insulting public security personnel and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, attempting to seize this important tool of proletarian dictatorship. The vigilant cadre and soldiers immediately surrounded the scene of the counter-revolutionary incident and launched a political offensive. The deceived masses, upon realizing the truth, immediately stood up to accuse and expose, angrily rooting out a handful of counter-revolutionaries. The resolute suppression of this handful of counter-revolutionaries greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary factions, greatly dampened the enemy's spirits, smashed the class enemy's counter-seizure of power plot, and promoted the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions. After fierce struggles, the proletarian revolutionary army held a power seizure meeting. The certain unit of the Shandong garrison immediately dispatched troops to participate in the meeting and protect the venue, ensuring that the proletarian revolutionary factions smoothly seized back all the powers usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Committee and Provincial People's Committee.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles." "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost; they must be defended by struggle." When the proletarian revolutionary army, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seized all the powers of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shandong Provincial Committee and Provincial People's Committee with the mighty force of revolution, the class enemies launched multiple counterattacks. They mobilized their puppet organizations to collude with the ghosts and snakes in society, spread rumors, deceived the masses, and incited some people who did not understand the truth to attack military leadership agencies, directing the spearhead at the strong rear support of the proletarian revolutionary factions—the People's Liberation Army, attempting to seize the power back from the proletarian revolutionary factions. At this critical moment, the army immediately dispatched many propaganda vehicles, broadcasting on the streets and distributing leaflets, closely uniting with the broad revolutionary masses, launching a more powerful political offensive against the enemy, exposing the enemy's plots with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely suppressing a handful of counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, special troops were dispatched to protect the revolutionary committee, and two large-scale armed parades and demonstrations were held. The proletarian revolutionary factions were elated, and the class enemies were terrified! The broad revolutionary masses were moved to tears, shouting enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Liberation Army of China!"

	As early as the initial period of the army's establishment, Chairman Mao taught us: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group that executes revolutionary political tasks.... Apart from fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it must also undertake the major tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary political power, and even building the organization of the Communist Party." The broad cadre and soldiers of the Shandong garrison, following Chairman Mao's teachings, actively carried out propaganda and organizational work for the masses in supporting the proletarian revolutionary factions in the power struggle. The leadership established reception stations, receiving thousands of visiting masses every day. Many cadres and soldiers went deep into the masses, propagating the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the party's policies, assisting the proletarian revolutionary factions in uniting and educating the deceived masses, making them quickly awaken and approach the proletarian revolutionary factions, strengthening the revolutionary forces, and isolating and striking the handful of capitalist-roaders and counter-revolutionaries. Many people excitedly said: With the Liberation Army fighting side by side with us, we will definitely achieve complete victory in the power struggle.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The seizure of national victory is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li." After achieving the victory of seizing power, the cadre and soldiers of the Shandong garrison, while maintaining high vigilance to protect the achievements of the power struggle, also formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going to factories, enterprises, and rural areas, resolutely executing Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasping revolution and promoting production," helping the proletarian revolutionary factions build a new revolutionary order, vigorously grasping the revolution, and vigorously promoting production. They went deep into the workshops, fields, and worked and studied Chairman Mao's works with the broad revolutionary masses, had heart-to-heart talks, and propagated Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production." The cadre and soldiers are determined to continue fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionary factions and make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    解放军坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席的战斗命令
    山东驻军在夺权斗争中立下不朽功勋
    新华社济南三日电　人民解放军驻山东地区部队响应伟大统帅毛主席的战斗号召，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，全心全意地支持和援助无产阶级革命派向山东省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权。他们积极参加“三结合”，和无产阶级革命派一起，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派纠合社会上的牛鬼蛇神和反动组织疯狂进行的一次又一次的反扑，对夺权斗争的胜利起了决定性的作用，立下了新的不朽的功勋。
    正当全国无产阶级文化大革命进入无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的新阶段，我们伟大统帅毛主席发出了人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大号召。驻山东地区部队全体指战员热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，一致表示，这是毛主席对我们的最大关怀、最大爱护、最大信任和最大鼓舞。我军历来无限忠于人民，和革命人民同呼吸，共命运，心相连。在这场严峻的阶级大搏斗中，我们要坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席的战斗命令，满腔热忱、毫不含糊、全心全意地支持和援助无产阶级革命派起来夺权。部队领导机关抽调大批干部组成了支援无产阶级革命派夺权的强有力的指挥机构，并派出干部广泛地和各个革命造反组织进行接触和联系，深入地进行调查研究，大力地支持无产阶级革命派大联合。广大指战员还认真地学习了毛主席的指示，做好了一切战斗准备。
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”就在“三结合”的无产阶级革命大军展开自下而上的夺权斗争的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派兴风作浪，大搞假夺权、反夺权。他们唆使一小撮反革命分子所控制的组织，围攻革命组织。操纵所谓“山东省工人革命造反联合会总部”的一小撮反革命分子，对革命群众组织进行了一系列的袭击和破坏。他们冲进一些机关、工厂、企业乱砸乱抢，并冲进无产阶级革命派掌握的省公安厅，捣毁档案室，殴打、辱骂公安人员和解放军战士，妄图夺取这个无产阶级专政的重要工具。有着高度警惕的指战员们对此早有察觉，他们立即包围了反革命肇事的现场，展开了政治攻势。被蒙蔽的群众明了真相后，当场起来控诉揭发，愤怒地揪出了一小撮反革命分子。对这一小撮反革命分子的坚决镇压，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了敌人的威风，打垮了阶级敌人反夺权的阴谋，促进了无产阶级革命派的大联合。经过激烈的搏斗，无产阶级革命大军召开了夺权大会。驻山东地区部队某部又立即出动参加大会和保卫会场，保证无产阶级革命派顺利地夺回了前山东省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的一切大权。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”当无产阶级革命大军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以雷霆万钧的革命威力夺取了山东省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切大权后，阶级敌人又进行了多次反扑，他们发动御用组织，与社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结起来，大造谣言，欺骗群众，煽动一些不明真相的人冲击军事领导机关，把矛头指向无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾——人民解放军，妄图从无产阶级革命派手中把大权再夺回去。在这个关键时刻，部队立即出动许多宣传车，沿街广播，散发传单，紧紧和广大革命群众结合，对敌人展开了更加强大的政治攻势，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想揭露敌人的阴谋，坚决镇压一小撮反革命分子。同时，专门派出部队保卫革命委员会，并举行了两次声势浩大的武装游行示威。无产阶级革命派欢欣鼓舞，阶级敌人落魂丧胆！广大革命群众激动得热泪盈眶，尽情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”
    早在建军初期，毛主席就教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。……它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”驻山东地区部队广大指战员遵照毛主席的教导，在支持无产阶级革命派夺权斗争中，积极地开展宣传和组织群众的工作。领导机关设立了接待站，每天接待上千来访群众。许多干部战士，深入到群众中去，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和党的政策，协助无产阶级革命派团结教育受蒙蔽的群众，使他们迅速觉悟过来，向无产阶级革命派靠拢，壮大革命队伍，孤立和打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及反革命分子。许多人激动地说：有解放军和我们并肩战斗，我们一定能够取得夺权斗争的彻底胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”在取得夺权胜利以后，驻山东地区部队指战员在百倍警惕，保卫夺权斗争成果的同时，又组成了毛泽东思想宣传队，分赴工厂、企业和农村，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，帮助无产阶级革命派建设革命新秩序，狠抓革命，猛促生产。他们深入到车间、田间和广大革命群众一起劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，促膝谈心，宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针。指战员们决心与无产阶级革命派继续并肩战斗，为无产阶级文化大革命做出新的贡献！
