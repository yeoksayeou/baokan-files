The revolutionary faction of the supply and marketing cooperative system in Jilin Province has responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have smashed the obstacles set by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and actively transported production materials to the countryside, enthusiastically supporting the poor and lower-middle peasants in launching the first phase of spring agricultural production.

A handful of capitalist-roaders within the supply and marketing cooperative system in Jilin Province had previously deliberately laid down their work, spreading a counter-revolutionary wind of economism, attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and disrupt the supply of agricultural production materials. The revolutionary faction of the supply and marketing cooperative system did not hesitate to step forward, bravely shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production. Many county and city supply and marketing cooperative systems' revolutionary factions repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping revolution, promoting production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." They said: Doing a good job in supplying agricultural production materials for spring plowing is a glorious political task for the revolutionary faction of the supply and marketing cooperative system. We must, with the highest enthusiasm, the fastest speed, and the greatest effort, timely complete the supply of agricultural production materials and support spring plowing.

The revolutionary faction of the supply and marketing cooperative system in Jilin Province carefully analyzed the current year's local agricultural production situation and characteristics, and studied specific measures to do a good job in supplying agricultural production materials. Each level of the supply and marketing cooperative established and strengthened specialized teams to support agricultural spring plowing, and in advance, went deep into some production teams and poor and lower-middle peasants' homes to investigate and research the needs for production materials this spring. Based on production needs, they arranged for the supply of goods. They adhered to the spirit of letting tools wait for production, not letting production wait for tools, and actively organized the transportation of production materials. Statistics show that since the beginning of the year, more than 60,000 tons of solid fertilizers and ammonia water have been transported to supply and marketing cooperatives below the county level, more than double the amount of the same period last year; a large amount of pesticides, plastic film, and a batch of small agricultural tools such as hoes and picks have also been transported, and more than 2,000 draft animals have been allocated to production teams.

To enable the poor and lower-middle peasants to concentrate on preparing for spring plowing, many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have dispatched personnel to actively deliver production materials to the countryside, carrying out services to the production teams, which has been praised by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 11th: The broad revolutionary workers on the industrial front in Guangzhou have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have urgently addressed the needs of spring plowing, overcome various difficulties, and actively produced fertilizers, pesticides, seedling films, agricultural machinery, parts, and small and medium-sized agricultural tools to support the frontline of spring plowing.

The revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory recently came up with ideas and solutions together and, with the help of the railway department, overcame the shortage of fuel to timely produce fertilizers for delivery to rural areas. The revolutionary workers of the Anti-Revisionism Workshop of the Zhujiang Electrochemical Factory also worked with great enthusiasm and completed the production tasks of over-quota superphosphate and six-six-six pesticides in January and February.

The production efficiency of the South China Grain Machinery Factory has been continuously improved despite the reduction in personnel due to the trial production of new products and support for mountainous areas. Revolutionary workers, inspired by Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," completed the production tasks of rice milling machines and parts in January and February and actively produced rice milling machine parts according to the needs of rural communes.

The revolutionary faction of the Guangdong Province Machine-Drawn Agricultural Tool Factory, which produces matching tools for tractors, had already, before the arrival of spring plowing, fully invested in the production of agricultural support products with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." In the first two months of this year, they produced 378 sets of Dongfanghong six-plow shares and more than 9,000 various parts. In late February, 100 sets of water paddy four-plow shares produced by this factory were delayed due to the late supply of some raw materials, and it seemed that the production task could not be completed on time due to the installation delay. At this critical moment, the revolutionary faction workers stepped forward. They strengthened production scheduling, organized manpower, launched a two-night sprint, and dispatched personnel to support assembly, painting, and other processes, finally completing the production task on time.

    吉林省供销社系统革命派勇挑革命生产两副重担
    调运生产资料下乡　热情支援春耕生产
    广州市工业战线职工加紧生产春耕急需产品
    新华社长春十五日电　吉林省供销社系统的无产阶级革命派，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派设下的障碍，积极调运生产资料下乡，热情支援贫下中农打响春耕生产第一炮。
    吉林省供销社系统党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派前些时候故意躺倒不干，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏农业生产资料供应工作。供销社系统的无产阶级革命派毫不迟疑地挺身而出，勇敢地挑起革命、生产两副重担。许多县、市供销社系统的无产阶级革命派反复学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》。他们说：做好春耕农业生产资料供应工作，是供销社系统无产阶级革命派的一项光荣的政治任务。我们一定要以最高的热情，最快的速度，最大的干劲，及时做好农业生产资料供应工作，支援春耕生产。
    吉林省供销社系统的无产阶级革命派细致地分析了今年当地农业生产形势和特点，研究了搞好农业生产资料供应工作的具体措施。各级供销社都建立和充实了支援农业春耕生产的专门班子，并提前深入到一部分生产队和贫下中农家里，对今春生产资料需要情况做了调查研究，根据生产需要安排货源。他们本着宁让工具等生产，不让生产等工具的精神，积极组织生产资料调运工作。据统计，自年初以来，已调往县以下供销社的固体化肥和氨水共六万多吨，比去年同时期增加一倍多；还调运了大量农药、塑料薄膜和一批铁锹、镐头等小农具，并为生产队调剂耕畜二千多头。
    为了使贫下中农集中精力搞好备耕，许多基层供销社都抽调人力，积极送生产资料下乡，开展服务到队活动，受到贫下中农的赞扬。
    据新华社广州十一日电　广州市工业战线广大革命职工，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，急春耕之急，千方百计克服困难，积极生产化肥、农药、育秧薄膜、农业机械、配件和中小农具等产品，支援春耕第一线。
    广州氮肥厂的革命职工最近共同出主意，想办法，并且在铁路部门的帮助下，克服了燃料不足的困难，及时生产出化肥运往农村。珠江电化厂反修车间的革命职工，也鼓足干劲，在一、二月份里超额完成了过磷酸钙、六六六农药的生产任务。
    华南粮食机械厂由于试制新产品和支援山区，人员减少了，但生产效率却不断提高，革命职工在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的鼓舞下，完成了一、二月份生产碾米机和配件的任务，还根据农村公社的需要，积极生产碾米机配件。
    为拖拉机生产配套农具的广东省机引农具厂的无产阶级革命派，早在春耕到来前，就以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，全力投入支援农业产品的生产。今年头两个月，他们已生产了东方红六铧犁等机引农具三百七十八台，各种配件九千多件。二月下旬，这个厂生产的一百台水田四铧犁，由于一些原材料供应较迟，眼看将因安装赶不上而完不成生产任务。就在这个时候，革命派的职工挺身而出。他们加强生产调度，组织人力，突击了两个晚上，还抽调人员支援装配、油漆等工序，终于按时完成了生产任务。
