	Indonesian writers strongly condemn the Soviet revisionists' plot to hold a fake "Third Congress" of Asian and African writers in Beirut this month, continuing their shameful conspiracy to sabotage the unity of Asian and African writers.

	The statement says that, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, we must completely and thoroughly expose the dirty tricks of the modern revisionists who are behind this fake "Third Congress."

	The statement points out that the Soviet revisionists are playing the role of lackeys of U.S. imperialism, sabotaging and splitting the Asian and African people's movements, and helping the imperialists achieve what they could not achieve on their own.

	The statement says that the plots and tricks of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists are doomed to failure, just as their attempts to block the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong from spreading to every corner of the world have failed miserably, and just as their attempts to suppress the unyielding revolutionary fighters of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world have failed shamefully.

	The statement says that Indonesian progressive writers fully support the statement issued by the Chinese Writers' Association. This statement powerfully exposes the plot of the Soviet revisionists to hold a fake "Third Congress" in Beirut and strongly condemns the treacherous and despicable behavior of the Soviet revisionists, who are traitors to the struggle of the Asian and African peoples.

	The statement enthusiastically praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The statement says that this cultural revolution, which is underway in China, has a global impact and is unprecedented in human history. It has dealt a heavy blow to the ghosts and monsters within China and will accelerate the demise of imperialism and modern revisionism worldwide. Therefore, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries—including the fascist regime of Suharto and Nasution—are afraid and worried about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They are trying their best to suppress the revolutionary waves that are surging around the world, but their efforts are bound to fail.

	The statement says that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has great significance for the struggle of the Asian and African peoples, especially for the struggle of Asian and African writers. It is under the strong inspiration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China that we welcome the preparations made by the Standing Committee and the Executive Secretariat of the Asian and African Writers' Conference for the Third Congress of Asian and African Writers to be held in China this year.

	The statement emphasizes that uniting Asian, African, and revolutionary writers worldwide to fight against the treacherous behavior of the Soviet revisionists and giving a heavy blow to this number-one lackey of U.S. imperialism is the task of the revolutionary people of the world and the task of Asian and African writers. As the great leader of the world revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong, has said: "Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have a world to win. Proletarians of all countries, unite!"

	The statement concludes by expressing that Indonesian progressive writers firmly believe that no matter how hard the Soviet revisionists try, they cannot stop the tide of the people's struggle. The Asian and African writers, full of fighting spirit and armed with the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong, are determined to overcome all difficulties and will surely achieve the final victory.

    印尼作家强烈谴责苏修策划召开亚非作家伪“三大”的阴谋
    亚非作家以毛泽东思想为武器
    坚决同苏修叛卖行为进行斗争
    新华社十七日讯　印度尼西亚进步作家代表里莎戈达最近发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义作家积极准备本月在贝鲁特举行伪亚非作家第三次大会，继续进行破坏亚非作家团结的可耻的阴谋活动。
    声明说，我们在中国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，必须完全和彻底地揭露制造这个伪“三大”的罪魁祸首现代修正主义者的这一肮脏阴谋。
    声明指出，苏联修正主义者扮演了美帝国主义仆从的角色，破坏和分裂亚非人民运动，使帝国主义者取得自己所不能取得的东西。
    声明说，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的阴谋诡计必将遭到失败，正象他们妄图阻挠光辉的毛泽东思想在全世界各个角落传播所遭到的失败一样可悲，正象他们镇压亚非拉美和全世界不屈不挠的革命战士所遭到的失败一样可耻。
    声明说，印度尼西亚进步作家完全支持中国作家协会发表的声明。这个声明有力地揭露了苏联修正主义者将在贝鲁特举行伪“三大”的阴谋，强烈谴责了亚非人民斗争的叛徒苏联修正主义者的背信弃义的卑鄙行径。
    声明热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。声明说，中国正在进行的这场文化大革命有着世界性的影响，是人类历史上空前未有的，它沉重地打击了中国国内的牛鬼蛇神，并将在世界上加速帝国主义和现代修正主义的灭亡。所以帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派——包括苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权——对中国无产阶级文化大革命感到害怕和忧虑。他们正在竭尽全力企图把目前在世界各地沸腾的革命巨浪压下去，但是，他们的努力肯定是白费的，必将遭到失败。中国革命和其他人民革命的发展，是世界上任何力量也阻挡不了的。
    声明说，中国无产阶级文化大革命对于亚非人民的斗争，特别是对于亚非作家的斗争，有着重大的意义。正是在中国无产阶级文化大革命的强烈鼓舞下，我们欢迎亚非作家常设局和执行书记处为今年在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会铺平道路所做的准备工作。
    声明强调说，团结亚非和全世界的革命作家同苏修的叛卖行为进行斗争，给美帝国主义的这个头号帮凶以沉重的打击，这是全世界革命人民的任务，是亚非作家的任务。正如世界革命的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所说：“全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。”
    声明最后表示，印度尼西亚进步作家完全相信，不管苏修花怎样大的力气，都不能阻挡人民斗争的洪流。斗志昂扬的亚非作家用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，下定决心克服一切困难，他们一定能够取得最后胜利。
