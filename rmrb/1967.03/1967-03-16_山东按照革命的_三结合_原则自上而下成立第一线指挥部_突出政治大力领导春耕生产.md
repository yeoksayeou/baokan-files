Shandong Province has established frontline command departments from the provincial, regional, and county levels down to the grassroots, which have played a powerful role in promoting revolution and production.

After achieving victory in the struggle for power, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, focused on revolution and production. It convened a meeting of provincial, regional, and county-level cadres with the central theme of promoting revolution and production. The meeting formally established the frontline command departments for production. Subsequently, special districts and counties universally established frontline command departments for production. These departments, at various levels, are composed of representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, military leaders, and revolutionary leading cadres, in accordance with the revolutionary "three-in-one" principle.

The establishment of frontline command departments for production at various levels in Shandong Province has two distinct features. One feature is that whether the areas have seized power or not, frontline command departments for production have been established. This ensures that the channels of communication between higher and lower levels remain unobstructed in areas where power has not yet been seized, thwarting the enemy's attempts to sabotage production and ensuring that production is well managed. At the same time, it creates conditions for establishing revolutionary "three-in-one" provisional power organs for future struggles to seize power. Another feature is that the representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the local areas have played a prominent role. They not only organize the massive manpower and material resources of the army to support spring production but, more importantly, they emphasize politics, focus on ideological work, and promote the ideological transformation of the people, setting a good example for leading cadres at various levels to manage production.

After the establishment of frontline command departments for production at various levels in Shandong Province, they immediately launched a series of activities centered around spring production. They prioritize the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought in all work, widely propagating Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Members of Rural People's Communes and Cadres at Various Levels." This has greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres: the attendance rate of community members has significantly increased; cadres have put down their mental burdens, stood up straight, and boldly led spring production. The frontline command departments for production at various levels, in consultation with the masses, have implemented production plans layer by layer. For example, in Yantai and Heze, the vast majority of production brigades have implemented production plans. In Huiimin, Liaocheng, Dezhou, and Heze, a total of 6,300 district, county, and commune-level cadre officials have been dispatched to the countryside. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently also dispatched more than 500 revolutionary cadres from the provincial-level organs to form "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams," which will go to various places to further mobilize the masses and organize the spring production upsurge together with the masses.

### 山东按照革命的“三结合”原则自上而下成立第一线指挥部  突出政治大力领导春耕生产

    山东按照革命的“三结合”原则自上而下成立第一线指挥部
    突出政治大力领导春耕生产
    本报讯　山东省从省、地、县自上而下建立起生产第一线指挥部，对抓革命，促生产起了有力的推动作用。
    山东省革命委员会在取得夺权斗争胜利后，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，抓革命，促生产，召开了以抓革命，促生产为中心内容的省、地、县三级干部会，正式成立了生产第一线指挥部。会后，专区、县两级普遍建立起生产第一线指挥部。各级生产第一线指挥部，按照革命的“三结合”原则，由革命群众组织代表、部队负责人和革命领导干部组成。
    山东省成立各级生产第一线指挥部，有两个明显的特点。一个特点是：不论夺权和没有夺权的地区，都把生产第一线指挥部建立起来。这样，在需要夺权而尚未夺权的地区，就可以保证上下联系的渠道畅通无阻，粉碎阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，把生产很好地抓起来。同时，还可以为今后夺权斗争建立革命的“三结合”临时权力机构创造条件。另一个特点是：驻当地的人民解放军代表起了突出的作用。他们不仅组织部队的巨大人力、物力支援春耕生产，更重要的是，他们突出政治，大抓活思想，大抓人的思想革命化，为各级干部领导生产树立了良好的榜样。
    山东省各级生产第一线指挥部建立后，立即围绕春耕生产展开了一系列的活动。他们把宣传毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，广泛地宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，大大激发了广大贫下中农和干部的革命热情和生产积极性：社员出勤率显著上升；干部放下思想包袱，挺起腰杆，大胆领导春耕生产。各级生产第一线指挥部，同群众商量，层层落实生产计划。如烟台、菏泽等地区，绝大部分生产大队落实了生产计划。惠民、聊城、德州、菏泽等四个地区，就抽调了专、县、社级机关干部六千三百多人下乡。省革命委员会最近也从省级机关抽调五百多名革命干部，组成“毛泽东思想宣传队”，分赴各地，进一步发动群众，同群众在一起组织春耕生产高潮。
