In accordance with the correct policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao, the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee was officially established.

Revolutionary organization representatives held a grand meeting, with more than 4,000 representatives repeatedly shouting, "Long live the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!" They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 22nd: The Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Organization Representatives Conference was grandly held in Taiyuan from March 12th to 18th. The conference comprehensively analyzed the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanxi Province, proposed future tasks, and in accordance with the correct policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao, officially established the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ—the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

This conference was held under the auspices of the increasingly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanxi Province. The basic characteristics of this situation are: the great alliance and unity of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" centered on the proletarian revolutionary masses have been formed; the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road has achieved decisive victories; the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" has achieved tremendous successes; the new revolutionary order is being rapidly established; the rule of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in Shanxi is on the verge of being thoroughly smashed. This is a victory celebration and a rally to enhance unity, as well as a rally to welcome new tasks. The holding of this conference once again demonstrates the tremendous might of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

On the 18th, the representatives attending the conference unanimously passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. The telegram stated: "All the victories of the Shanxi Cultural Revolution are great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." "Most beloved Chairman Mao: We are determined to read your books, listen to your words, act according to your instructions, and follow you to revolutionize for life!" When the telegram was passed, the venue resonated with thunderous, unending applause. All the representatives, filled with boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Chairman Mao, repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!"

More than 4,000 representatives attended this conference. They came from revolutionary organizations and various levels of leadership organs in all prefectures, cities, and counties across the province, as well as from the Shanxi Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the PLA units stationed in Shanxi. Members of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China and the responsible persons of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters also attended the conference.

The Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, which was announced at this conference, was democratically elected by the representatives. It is composed of responsible persons from revolutionary mass organizations that truly represent the broad masses of Shanxi, representatives of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres. It is both a temporary power organ of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and also the unified command organ of the proletarian revolutionary mass organizations in Shanxi Province. This conference elected 245 committee members, of whom 118 are responsible persons from various revolutionary mass organizations, accounting for 48.1% of the total number of committee members. The committee also elected 27 standing committee members. Liu Geping, the head of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China, was elected as the chairman of this committee, and Zhang Riquing, the deputy head of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China, Liu Guan Yi, the member and secretary-general of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China, and the nationally renowned labor model Chen Yonggui, were elected as vice chairmen.

During the conference, Liu Geping, Zhang Riquing, Liu Guan Yi, and Yuan Zhen, representing the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, made reports to the conference.

In his report "The Situation and Future Tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanxi Province," Liu Geping, the head of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China, said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanxi Province is currently in a very good situation and is getting better and better. The great alliance and unity of the revolutionary masses centered on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" are further developing, and the rule of counter-revolutionary revisionism has collapsed. The cultural revolution and industrial and agricultural production in the entire province are rapidly advancing. The surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Army, following the direction indicated by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, is launching a comprehensive offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with the momentum of overturning mountains and rivers and the force of thunder and lightning. Liu Geping's report pointed out: The arduous and glorious task currently facing us proletarian revolutionaries is mainly to consolidate and develop the great alliance and unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses centered on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, resolutely suppress the sabotage and counterattacks of the class enemies, and safeguard and develop the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; to implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," quickly establish and improve two sets of revolutionary and productive cadres, and while pushing the revolution forward, launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production, and complete the various production tasks for this year. In addition, we must carry out the rectification movement and build a highly proletarianized and highly combatant Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Army.

In his report "On the Draft Organizational Regulations of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee," Liu Guan Yi, the member and secretary-general of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China, said: Under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the combination of responsible persons from revolutionary mass organizations, representatives of the local garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres is a great development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao, and is the best revolutionary form today under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is more conducive to closely connecting with the masses and fully embodying the will of the people. More importantly, it makes the dictatorship of the proletariat more solid. Liu Guan Yi's report gave a detailed explanation of the origin of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, its nature and organizational form, as well as its basic tasks and characteristics.

Yuan Zhen, a member of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China, made a report titled "Firmly Grasp Revolution, Promote Production, and Strive for Victory in Both Revolution and Production." Yuan Zhen said, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries in Shanxi have truly and resolutely implemented the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," firmly grasped the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, achieving brilliant results in both revolution and production. Since February, the situation of industrial and agricultural production has been getting better and better. The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural Areas Across the Country" has greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses in rural areas, and they are now firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting spring production. However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are still desperately opposing and sabotaging the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by Chairman Mao. We must immediately mobilize and resolutely counterattack them, and thoroughly defeat them.

Zhang Riquing, the deputy head of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China, made a report to the conference titled "Universal and In-Depth Rectification Movement to Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End." He explained the great significance of the rectification movement and made an initial summary of the rectification of the revolutionary factions in Shanxi Province in the previous period. He said, due to the deepening development of the struggle to seize power by the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses, some revolutionary organizations and revolutionary rebel fighters have shown some unhealthy tendencies after the victory of seizing power. This erroneous tendency, in the final analysis, is a matter of "self." This is a great enemy of the revolution and a great enemy of the people. With the great enemy at hand, it must be overthrown. All revolutionary organizations and fighters must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, raise the awareness of rectification, improve the methods of rectification, adhere to high standards and high quality in rectification, and through the rectification movement, make each revolutionary organization a highly proletarianized and highly combatant cultural revolution army.

The representatives fully discussed the reports made by Liu Geping and others to the conference. Thirty representatives, representing revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, PLA soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary organizations in various prefectures, counties, and cities, spoke at the conference. The representatives fully supported the reports made by Liu Geping and others and adopted the corresponding resolutions. The representatives believe that to complete the arduous tasks ahead, we must work even harder to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words more seriously, and act more strictly according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They are determined to further hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, under the leadership of the Shanxi Core Group of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

On March 19th, 300,000 revolutionary masses in Taiyuan held a grand rally to warmly celebrate the official establishment of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee. (Photo attached)

    遵照伟大领袖毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的正确方针
    山西省革命委员会正式建立
    革命组织代表隆重举行会议，四千多名代表不断高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    新华社太原二十二日电　山西省革命组织代表会议于三月十二日至十八日在太原隆重举行。会议全面分析了山西省当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势，提出了今后的任务，并遵照伟大领袖毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的正确方针，正式建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——山西省革命委员会。
    这次会议是在山西省无产阶级文化大革命越来越好的形势下召开的。这个形势的基本特点是：以革命的“三结合”为核心的无产阶级革命派的大联合已经形成；向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争已经取得了决定性的胜利；“抓革命，促生产”取得了巨大的成绩；革命的新秩序正在加速建立；党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在山西的统治已濒于彻底摧毁。这是一次庆祝胜利、增强团结的祝捷大会，也是一次迎接新任务的誓师大会。这次大会的召开，又一次体现了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。
    十八日，出席会议的代表，万分激动地通过了给最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。致敬电中写道：“山西文化大革命的一切胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”“最最敬爱的毛主席：我们决心一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，跟着您干一辈子革命！”当通过电文时，会场上响起了暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声，全体代表满怀对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜的激情，不断地振臂高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    出席这次会议的代表共四千多人。他们来自全省各个专区、市、县的革命组织以及各级领导机关，来自中国人民解放军山西省军区和中国人民解放军驻山西部队。中共山西核心小组的成员和山西革命造反总指挥部的负责人也都出席了会议。
    在这次会议上宣告建立的山西省革命委员会，是经过代表们民主选举产生的，是由真正代表山西广大群众的革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的代表和革命领导干部组成的。它既是以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，也是山西省无产阶级革命群众组织的统一指挥机关。这次大会共选出委员会委员二百四十五名，其中各革命群众组织的负责人一百一十八人，占委员总数的百分之四十八点一。委员会内又选出常委二十七名。中共山西核心小组组长刘格平当选为这个委员会的主任委员，中共山西核心小组副组长张日清、组员兼秘书长刘贯一，全国著名劳动模范陈永贵等当选为副主任委员。
    会议进行中，刘格平、张日清、刘贯一和袁振等四位同志，代表中共山西核心小组和山西革命造反总指挥部，分别向大会作了报告。
    中共山西核心小组组长刘格平在“山西省无产阶级文化大革命运动的形势和今后任务”的报告中说：目前山西省的无产阶级文化大革命是一派大好形势，而且越来越好。以革命的“三结合”为核心的革命派大联合、大团结正在进一步发展，反革命修正主义的统治已经土崩瓦解。全省文化大革命和工农业生产正飞速向前发展。浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，正沿着伟大舵手毛主席指引的方向，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起了全面总攻击。刘格平的报告指出：当前摆在我们无产阶级革命派面前的艰巨而又光荣的任务主要是：巩固和发展以革命的“三结合”为核心的无产阶级革命派大联合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利；加强无产阶级专政，坚决镇压阶级敌人的破坏和反扑，保卫和发展无产阶级文化大革命的成果；贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，迅速建立和健全革命、生产两套班子，在把革命向前推进的同时，掀起工农业生产的新高潮，胜利完成今年的各项生产任务。此外，要开展整风运动，建立起一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的无产阶级文化革命大军。
    中共山西核心小组组员兼秘书长刘贯一在“关于山西省革命委员会暂行组织条例草案”的报告中说：在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的代表和革命领导干部实行“三结合”，是毛主席对于马克思列宁主义的又一伟大的发展，是今天无产阶级专政的条件下，进行革命的一种最好的革命形式。它更便于密切联系群众，最充分地体现人民群众的意志。更为重要的是，它使无产阶级专政更加巩固。刘贯一的报告就山西省革命委员会的产生、它的性质及其组织形式，以及它的基本任务和特点等，作了详细的阐述。
    中共山西核心小组组员袁振在会上作了“狠抓革命，猛促生产，坚决争取革命、生产双胜利”的报告。袁振说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，山西的无产阶级革命派真正坚决执行了“抓革命，促生产”的方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产，已取得了革命、生产双胜利的辉煌战果。二月份以来工农业生产情况都是越来越好。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，大大鼓舞了农村广大群众的革命干劲，他们正在狠抓革命，大促春耕生产。可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子，还在拚命反对和破坏毛主席亲自提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，我们必须立即动员起来，坚决予以反击，把他们彻底打垮。
    中共山西核心小组副组长张日清给大会作了“普遍深入地开展整风运动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的报告。他阐明了整风的伟大意义，并对山西省前一段革命派的整风作了初步小结。他说，由于无产阶级革命派大联合夺权斗争的深入发展，一些革命组织和革命造反派战士在夺权胜利后出现了一些不健康倾向。这种错误倾向归根到底，是一个“私”字。这是革命的大敌，是人民的大敌。大敌当前，一定要把它打倒。各革命组织和战士一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，提高对整风的认识，改进整风的方法，坚持整风的高标准、高质量，通过整风运动，使各个革命组织都能成为一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的文化革命大军。
    代表们对刘格平等同志向大会作的报告，进行了充分的讨论。有三十名代表分别代表革命的工人、革命的农民、解放军指战员、革命的学生、革命的知识分子、革命的干部及各专区、县、市的革命组织，在大会上发了言。代表们完全拥护刘格平等同志所作的报告，并通过了相应的决议。代表们认为，为完成今后的艰巨任务，必须更努力地读毛主席的书，更认真地听毛主席的话，更严格地照毛主席的指示办事。他们决心进一步高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在中共山西核心小组和山西省革命委员会的领导下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。（附图片）
