Title: The "Peace Talks" Smoke Screen Cannot Conceal the War-Mongering Face

The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Goldberg, concluded his activities in Asia on March 6, where he had been peddling his "peace talks" scheme. Over the course of more than ten days, from February 23, Goldberg flew from east to west, visiting Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, Saigon, and Manila. This is part of the U.S.'s counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy of expanding the war in Vietnam and promoting "peace talks."

Since mid-February, the U.S. has taken steps to intensify the war in Vietnam. In South Vietnam, the U.S. launched an unprecedented "dry season offensive." In North Vietnam, the U.S. not only intensified its bombing but also openly escalated the war by shelling Vietnamese territory from land and sea, and laying mines in Vietnamese rivers. It is at this juncture that the U.S. has been widely promoting its "peace talks" deception. Goldberg, acting on the orders of U.S. President Johnson, embarked on his Asian tour to engage in these deceptive activities.

What did Goldberg bring to Asia to peddle? In a speech delivered before his departure from the U.S., he revealed some of the contents. According to the U.S. News Agency, the main points were: negotiating the Vietnam issue "without preconditions"; the involvement of so-called "international organizations—the United Nations or other organizations"—in the Vietnam issue; the Geneva Agreement as a "peaceful settlement basis that can be accepted"; reopening the "Geneva Conference," with "President Johnson prepared to participate"; and the United Nations "fully playing its role as a peace builder," among others. Clearly, this plan, which is labeled with the United Nations and the Geneva Agreement, aims to coordinate with the U.S.'s war escalation, to deceive the Vietnamese people into stopping their fight, laying down their arms, and surrendering.

After arriving in Japan, Goldberg repeated the same old tune, shamelessly declaring that "the door to peace is open and will remain open." At the same time, he openly threatened the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, forbidding it from continuing to support the just struggle of the people in South Vietnam. Goldberg boasted that the U.S. "must be prepared for a long-term struggle." This fully exposed the vicious face of the Johnson administration.

According to Western news agencies, during his visit to Asia, Goldberg had contact with representatives of the Soviet revisionist group, asking them to help promote the "peace talks" deception. At the same time, U.N. Secretary-General U Thant also flew to Rangoon for frequent diplomatic activities.

Another task of Goldberg's visit to Asia was to strengthen U.S. and its lackeys' activities against China. It is reported that Goldberg and Sato, and Chiang Kai-shek exchanged views on the "Chinese situation" respectively.

Just as Goldberg was visiting Asia, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued solemn statements on February 28 and March 1, respectively. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stated clearly that the "peace" talk of U.S. imperialism "is nothing but a trick; its actual actions are to strengthen and expand the war, and its plot is to stay in South Vietnam and permanently split Vietnam." These two important statements are undoubtedly a powerful response to the U.S.'s recent war "escalation" and Goldberg's activities in promoting the "peace talks" deception.

### “和谈”烟幕掩不住好战面目  戈德堡到亚洲推销“和谈”阴谋，妄图诱骗越南人民放下武器

    “和谈”烟幕掩不住好战面目
    戈德堡到亚洲推销“和谈”阴谋，妄图诱骗越南人民放下武器
    本报讯　美国驻联合国大使戈德堡已在六日结束了在亚洲推销“和谈”阴谋的活动。从二月二十三日以来的十多天中，戈德堡飞东飞西，先后到了东京、汉城、台北、西贡和马尼拉。这是美国玩弄扩大侵越战争和“和谈”阴谋反革命两手的一个组成部分。
    美国从二月中旬以来，在越南采取了加紧扩大战争的步骤。在越南南方，美国发动了规模空前的所谓“旱季攻势”。在越南北方，美国不仅加紧进行狂轰滥炸，并且公然采取了新的战争升级行动，从陆地和海上用大炮轰击越南领土，并向越南内河布设水雷。正是在这个时候，美国推销“和谈”骗局的活动也在广泛进行。戈德堡也就奉美帝头子约翰逊之命出访亚洲，大搞阴谋活动。
    戈德堡带些什么货色到亚洲来兜售呢？他在离美前夕发表的一篇讲演中，透露了一些内容。据美国新闻处报道，主要是：越南问题“不带先决条件地进行谈判”；由所谓“国际机构——联合国或其它机构”插手越南问题；日内瓦协议是“和平解决的可以接受的基础”；重开“日内瓦会议”，“约翰逊总统准备参加”；联合国“充分发挥它作为和平缔造者的作用”等等。显然，这个贴上联合国和日内瓦协议标签的计划的目的，说穿了，就是配合美国扩大战争的行动，诱骗越南人民停止战斗，放下武器，屈膝投降。
    戈德堡到日本后，重弹上述老调，无耻地宣称“和平大门敞开着，并将继续敞开”。同时，他又公然威胁越南民主共和国，不准它继续支援越南南方人民的正义斗争。戈德堡叫嚣说，美国“必须准备进行长期斗争”。这就完全暴露了约翰逊政府的凶恶嘴脸。
    据西方通讯社透露，戈德堡在访问亚洲期间，曾和苏修集团方面代表进行接触，要求苏修协助推销“和谈”骗局。在这同时，联合国秘书长吴丹也专程飞往仰光，进行频繁的外交活动。
    戈德堡访问亚洲的另一个任务，就是加强美国及其仆从反对中国的活动。据报道，戈德堡和佐藤、蒋介石曾分别交换了对“中国局势的看法”。
    就在戈德堡访问亚洲途中，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国外交部，分别在二月二十八日和三月一日发表了严正声明。越南南方民族解放阵线声明明确指出，美帝国主义的“和平”论调“只不过是一个骗局，它的实际行动是加强和扩大战争，它的阴谋是死赖在越南南方，长期分割越南”。这两个重要声明，无疑是对美国最近的战争“升级”和戈德堡推销“和谈”骗局活动的有力回击。
