On the evening of February 25, when we were in the midst of intense struggle, we suddenly heard the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast a short comment from the *Red Flag* magazine titled "Recommend Two Good Articles," an editorial note from the *People's Daily*, and news about our battle team's big-character poster "Where is Our Lu Xun Brigade Heading?" Everyone's blood boiled with excitement and joy, and from the bottom of our hearts, we shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! This is Your greatest support, greatest concern, and greatest encouragement for us, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai! All members of our battle team felt both extremely excited and deeply ashamed at the same time. We felt that we had not studied Chairman Mao's works enough, that our minds were still filled with various non-proletarian thoughts, and that there were still many errors and shortcomings in our work, far from meeting the Party's requirements for us. If we say that we have achieved some results in the past struggles, if we say that our big-character poster is good, it is all thanks to Chairman Mao's teachings. This is entirely due to the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Our battle team consists of twelve young fighters with no experience in struggle. When the movement began, we listened to Chairman Mao's teachings and felt that the Party branch had been implementing a line of "technical first" and "rewarding with fame and fortune" for many years, that the main leaders of the Party branch were capitalists in power, and that the problem was very serious. We must rebel, and there is no other way! However, at that time, the resistance was very strong, and the forces of the bourgeois reactionary line and conservatism were very powerful, while we young people lacked experience in struggle. What should we do? At this time, we thought of our great teacher, Chairman Mao. Everyone felt that sailing the vast sea requires a helmsman. As long as we firmly follow the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will do as Chairman Mao says, fearing neither heaven nor earth, neither ghosts nor gods. We will fight while learning, and we will definitely achieve the final victory! Therefore, from the moment our battle team was established, we set a rule to study Chairman Mao's works during the Cultural Revolution. Over the past half year, in the intense struggle against a handful of capitalists in power within the Party and various conservative forces, we have basically adhered to this most important rule. We followed Comrade Lin Biao's teachings, based on the situation of the movement in our unit and the problems within our team, selected relevant chapters or quotations from Chairman Mao's works, and combined them with editorials from the *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine, as well as other supplementary materials. We discussed them section by section, sentence by sentence. We combined our study sessions with work discussions, researching the movement, and comparing our actions with Chairman Mao's teachings and central newspaper editorials. We combined our study sessions with democratic life, holding them every two days (sometimes every day), learning while conducting criticism and self-criticism, and engaging in ideological debates. Because our study sessions were combined with democratic life and work research, and because everyone dared to speak their minds and express their views without fear or favor, our study sessions almost always involved heated debates. We often argued until our faces were red and our ears were hot, and sometimes we even shed tears. But because everyone laid their thoughts bare, we were able to reach a consensus quickly according to Chairman Mao's teachings and advance step by step in the great winds and waves of struggle.

Looking back at the process of writing the big-character poster "Where is Our Lu Xun Brigade Heading?", it was the same. The issues mentioned in this poster were all our reflections from studying Chairman Mao's works during the "January Revolution."

For example, issues like the "pure military viewpoint" and "material first" were quite evident in the Lu Xun Brigade in January. At that time, during our study, we discussed this issue. There were two different opinions in the team. Some comrades believed that the tendency within the brigade to focus solely on fighting, concentrating all efforts on overthrowing XXXX and exposing XXXX, while neglecting the study of Chairman Mao's works and ideological revolution, was extremely wrong. Other comrades, however, believed that the reason the movement system had produced revisionism was because there were a few capitalists in power. Now, as long as these people are overthrown, the Cultural Revolution in the movement system will achieve victory. Thus, a heated debate ensued. Later, everyone further studied relevant works by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: "The Red Army's fighting is not just for the sake of fighting, but to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and help the masses build a revolutionary government. Without these goals, fighting loses its meaning, and the Red Army loses its purpose." He also said: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country in the ideological realm will take a considerable amount of time to resolve.... If one does not fully recognize this situation, or does not recognize it at all, one will make a great mistake and neglect the necessary ideological struggle." Chairman Mao's teachings hit the mark, solving our problems. Linking this to the fact that the existence of a pure military viewpoint within the brigade, neglecting ideological revolution, had already led to the emergence of sectarianism, extremism, individualism, and ultra-democracy, as well as the bad consequences of "material first" and severe detachment from the masses in work, all members of the team deeply felt that emphasizing ideological revolution and political education, while having a pure military viewpoint and purely overthrowing officials for the sake of fighting, was completely wrong. It could only make this great proletarian Cultural Revolution a mere formality. The result would be that while the organizational structure of revisionism was overthrown, in thought, their influence would remain. Revolutionary revisionists, once overthrown, would be replaced by others, and even we ourselves might execute the bourgeois reactionary line.

At the end of January, when the movement system was in the midst of a power seizure struggle, various wrong thoughts within the entire brigade became even more evident. At this time, we repeatedly studied a passage from Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction": "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within society in the Party. If there are no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve them within the Party, the Party's life will stop." Linking this to the situation in the Lu Xun Brigade, we felt that many problems were reflections of the struggle between the two classes and two lines within our ranks, and that the problems were quite serious, urgently needing rectification. However, on the issue of how to carry out rectification, there were different opinions. Some comrades believed that since we were busy fighting, rectification should be postponed until after the "Three-Dry Meeting" campaign was over. Others believed that rectification should be done first behind closed doors, solving the problems internally before exposing some of them externally. The majority of comrades disagreed with this view, believing that rectification in the Lu Xun Brigade was urgently needed, but the fighting could not stop. We must fight while rectifying. As for the method of rectification, it should be open, fully exposing problems without hiding anything. Facing the two different opinions, another heated debate ensued. During the discussion, everyone further studied relevant works by Chairman Mao. "We must rectify, and we will continue to rectify, to constantly remove the wrong things within us, so that we can better shoulder this task and better work together with all reform-minded gentlemen outside the Party." "The Communist Party is not afraid of criticism because we are Marxists. Truth is on our side, and the basic masses of workers and peasants are on our side."—Chairman Mao's teachings quickly unified the consciousness of all members of the team. Everyone felt that we revolutionary masses not only dare to rebel against a handful of capitalists in power within the Party but also dare to rebel against the "self" in our minds. We must not fear exposing our "family shame" or touching our souls. We must fight while rectifying, immediately carrying out open rectification during the "Three-Dry Meeting," fully exposing all problems, allowing everyone to criticize and supervise, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to smash the bourgeois headquarters in our minds. If we do not do this, our great alliance and seizure of power will fail, and our revolutionary cause will not be able to continue to advance.

In this way, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the comrades in our battle team, through various ideological struggles and linking them with practical struggles, gradually raised their consciousness, saw clearly the problems within our team and the brigade, and collectively wrote the big-character poster "Where is Our Lu Xun Brigade Heading?" Our most red, most red red sun, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "We must not become complacent and self-satisfied as soon as we see some achievements. We should curb complacency and constantly criticize our shortcomings, just as we wash our faces and sweep the floor every day to keep clean and remove dust." Our Dongfanghong Battle Team has achieved some results in the past struggles, and this is entirely due to Chairman Mao's teachings. We still have many mistakes and shortcomings, and now Chairman Mao has once again pointed out the direction for us to advance. We must be humble and cautious, and do as we say, advancing bravely in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao. We will study Chairman Mao's books for life and make revolution for life with Chairman Mao! We will fight for the proletariat and for our great socialist motherland!

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, ten thousand years to our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao!

    跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命
    鲁迅兵团东方红战斗队
    二月二十五日晚上，当我们正在紧张战斗的时刻，突然听到了中央人民广播电台广播《红旗》杂志短评《推荐两篇好文章》、《人民日报》编者按和我们战斗队的大字报《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》的消息，大家热血沸腾，感到无比的激动和喜悦，从心底里发出高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！这是您老人家对我们上海无产阶级革命派的最大的支持，最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞！我们战斗队的全体同志，在无比兴奋的同时，又感到很惭愧，我们觉得过去学习毛主席著作还很不够，自己头脑里还有各种非无产阶级思想，在工作中也还存在不少错误、缺点，距离党对我们的要求还很远。要说我们在过去的斗争中有一点成绩，要说我们的大字报好，那也全是毛主席教导的结果，这完全归功于伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    我们战斗队十二个战士都是没有斗争经验的小青年。运动开始，我们听了毛主席的教导，感到运动系党总支历年来贯彻着一条技术挂帅，大搞名利刺激的修正主义路线，党总支的主要领导是走资本主义道路的当权派，问题非常严重，一定要造反，非造反不可！但是，当时阻力很大，资产阶级反动路线的势力和保守势力都很强，而我们这些青年人又缺乏斗争经验，怎么办呢？这时，我们就想起了伟大的导师毛主席，大家感到大海航行靠舵手，只要坚决用毛泽东思想作指导，毛主席怎么讲，我们就怎么去闯，天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕，一边斗争，一边学习，一定能够取得最后胜利！因此，我们战斗队从成立那时起，就订下了一条坚持在文化大革命中学习毛主席著作的制度。近半年来，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和各种保守势力的紧张斗争中，我们基本上都坚持执行了这条最重要的制度。我们按照林彪同志的教导，根据当时单位里运动的情况，自己队伍里的问题，选择毛主席著作中有关的章节或语录，再结合《人民日报》《红旗》杂志的社论，及其他辅助材料，逐段逐节、逐字逐句的讨论。我们通过学习会结合谈工作，研究运动，对照毛主席的教导和中央报刊社论，议论每一步的行动计划。我们通过学习会结合过民主生活，每二天一次（有时一天一次），一面学习，一面进行批评和自我批评，展开思想交锋。由于我们的学习是结合民主生活和研究工作一起进行的，并且大家都不顾情面大胆亮思想、摆观点，所以我们的学习会差不多每次都要展开激烈的争论，也经常辩得面红耳赤，有时甚至掉眼泪。但由于大家把思想都全部摊了出来，所以最后都能按照毛主席的教导，提高了认识，较快地取得统一，在斗争的大风大浪中一步一步向前迈进。
    回顾我们写《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》这张大字报的情况，也是这样。这张大字报中所提到的一些问题，都是我们在“一月革命”的风暴中，大家学习毛主席著作的一些体会。
    如单纯军事观点、“材料挂帅”等问题，一月份在鲁迅兵团就暴露得比较明显了。当时我们在学习中谈起了这个问题，队里有两种不同看法。有的同志认为：兵团内这种单纯为打仗而打仗，集中一切精力单纯搞打倒×××，揪出×××，而忽视毛主席著作学习，忽视思想革命的倾向是极端错误的。而有的同志却认为：过去运动系之所以会出修正主义，就是因为有几个走资本主义道路的当权派，现在只要把这些人打倒就行了，运动系的文化大革命也就能取得胜利了。于是大家就展开了激烈的争论，后来大家进一步找毛主席的有关著作对照学习。毛主席说：“红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的，离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。”又说：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。……如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”毛主席的这些教导说到了我们的心里，使我们的问题迎刃而解。再联系由于兵团内存在单纯军事观点，忽视了思想革命，已经出现了小团体主义，风头主义，个人主义，极端民主化等错误思想，以及在工作上搞“材料挂帅”，严重脱离群众的不良后果，全队战士一致深深地感到：不突出思想革命和政治教育，单纯的军事观点，单纯的罢官，为打仗而打仗的倾向是完全错误的。它只能使这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命走过场。其结果，必然是组织上罢了修正主义的官，而在思想上却没有罢他们的官，修正主义的土壤还是存在。反革命修正主义分子一个被打倒了，第二个又会爬上来，甚至可能自己就会执行资产阶级反动路线。
    一月底，运动系正在搞夺权斗争的时候，全团里的各种错误思想暴露得更明显了，这时，我们反复学习了毛主席在《矛盾论》中说的一段话：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”联系鲁迅兵团的情况，我们感到许多问题都是两个阶级、两条路线的斗争在我们队伍里的反映，并且问题还比较严重，急需进行整风。但在如何进行整风的问题上，大家又有不同的看法。有些同志认为：现在忙于打仗，整风最好等到打完“三干会议”这个战役后再把仗停下来专门搞。另外，要整的话应该先关门整，把问题解决了，再把一些可以摊出去的问题摊出去。多数同志不同意这个意见，认为：现在鲁迅兵团的问题已经暴露，整风急需开展，但仗也不能停下来，一定要边打仗边整风。至于整风方法，则应该开门整，并且要全部敞开，不能遮遮掩掩。面对着两种不同的意见，又展开了激烈的争论，大家在讨论中进一步学习毛主席的有关著作。“我们所以要整风，现在要整风，将来还要整风，要不断地把我们身上的错误东西整掉，就是为了使我们能够更好地担负起这项任务，更好地同党外的一切立志改革的志士仁人共同工作。”“共产党是不怕批评的，因为我们是马克思主义者，真理是在我们方面，工农基本群众是在我们方面。”——毛主席的这些教导，使我们全队战士很快统一了认识，大家感到：我们无产阶级革命派不仅要敢于造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，而且还要敢于造自己头脑里“私”字的反，绝不能怕“家丑”外扬，绝不能怕触痛灵魂，必须边打仗边整风。在搞“三干会议”的同时，立即进行开门整风，把问题全部摊出来，让大家批评监督，用毛泽东思想作武器，把脑子里的资产阶级司令部打个粉碎。不这样做，我们的大联合夺权就要失败，我们的革命事业也就不能继续前进。
    就这样，在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下，我们战斗队的同志联系斗争实践，经过各种各样的思想斗争，逐步提高了认识，看清了自己队里和兵团里的问题，集体执笔写出了《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》的大字报。我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席教导我们：“我们决不能一见成绩就自满自足起来。我们应该抑制自满，时时批评自己的缺点，好象我们为了清洁，为了去掉灰尘，天天要洗脸，天天要扫地一样。”我们东方红战斗队，过去在战斗中取得了一点成绩，这完全是毛主席教导的结果。我们还有许多错误和缺点，现在毛主席又一次给我们指明了前进的方向，我们一定要戒骄戒躁，说到做到，按照毛主席指明的方向奋勇前进。读一辈子毛主席的书，跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命！为无产阶级争气，为伟大的社会主义祖国争气！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
