The representative of the South West Africa People's Organization in Cairo, Moses Kajiurungua and Weyi, issued a statement on March 29, expressing strong support for the formal establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in China. They condemned the crimes of the Soviet revisionists in splitting the anti-imperialist movement of the Afro-Asian peoples and announced that they would have no relations with the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization based in Cairo.

The statement said regarding the formal establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in China: "This is indeed a revolutionary action, fully implementing the resolution of the Winnieba Conference on the Fifth Conference. All true revolutionaries in the Afro-Asian countries welcome this action by the China Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee."

The statement said: "The people of South West Africa sincerely accept the invitation of the Chinese people to go to Beijing to make joint efforts for the success of the Fifth Conference, and look forward to that day. At that time, they will send their representatives to Beijing to fight side by side with their Afro-Asian brothers to build a new, revolutionary, fighting, and united Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Movement that truly reflects the wishes of the Afro-Asian peoples. We call on all Afro-Asian revolutionaries to go to Beijing—the bastion of the world's anti-imperialist struggle—to meet the greatest teacher of all oppressed peoples in the world, Chairman Mao Zedong."

The statement strongly condemned the crimes of the Soviet revisionists in splitting the anti-imperialist movement of the Afro-Asian peoples. The statement said that the Soviet modern revisionists held an illegal "Eighth Afro-Asian Solidarity Council" meeting in Nicosia and a fake "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" in Beirut, exposing themselves as the biggest splitters of the contemporary era.

The statement pointed out: "The Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization based in Cairo, under the manipulation and control of the Soviet modern revisionists, has become a counter-revolutionary, anti-people, and anti-China institution. It obstructs some revolutionary organizations from joining, but welcomes some counter-revolutionary revisionist lackeys who crawl out from the historical garbage heap to join their ranks. It has become an outright propaganda machine for the Soviet revisionists in the Afro-Asian countries. It has participated in the 'international organizations' manipulated by the Kremlin and headquartered in Eastern Europe. It has become a specialized tool for the modern revisionists to manipulate, engage in political intrigue, sabotage, and secret activities, and to split the Afro-Asian liberation movement and the Afro-Asian solidarity movement." The statement further pointed out: "The Permanent Secretariat based in Cairo has degenerated into a tool for intimidation and fascist dictatorship."

The statement solemnly declared: "Given the policy adopted by the Permanent Secretariat, it is only natural that the true representatives of the people of South West Africa, the South West Africa People's Organization, will have no relations with it."

    西南非洲民族联盟代表支持在北京举行亚非团结大会
    决心为革命的亚非团结运动而战斗
    宣布不同苏修操纵的亚非团结组织书记处发生关系
    新华社开罗二十九日电　西南非洲民族联盟驻开罗代表莫塞斯·卡吉翁瓜和维伊二十九日在这里发表声明，热烈支持第五届亚非人民团结大会中国筹备委员会的正式成立，谴责苏修分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的罪行，同时宣布不同设在开罗的亚非人民团结组织常设书记处发生任何关系。
    声明在谈到第五届亚非人民团结大会中国筹备委员会的正式成立时说：“这的确是革命行动，充分执行温尼巴会议关于第五届大会的决议的行动。亚非国家一切真正的革命者都欢迎中国亚非团结委员会的这一行动。”
    声明说：“西南非洲人民热诚地接受中国人民关于到北京去为第五届大会的成功共同作出努力的邀请，并盼望着这一天的到来。到那时候，他们将派出自己的代表到北京去，同亚非兄弟们并肩斗争，来创建崭新的、革命战斗和团结一致的、真正反映亚非人民愿望的亚非人民团结运动。我们呼吁一切亚非革命者都到北京——世界反帝斗争的堡垒——去见见全世界一切被压迫人民的最伟大的导师毛泽东主席。”
    声明强烈谴责苏修分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的罪行。声明说，苏联现代修正主义者在尼科西亚非法召开的“第八届亚非团结理事会”会议和在贝鲁特举行的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，暴露了他们是当代最大的分裂者的真面目。
    声明指出：“设在开罗的亚非人民团结组织常设书记处，在苏联现代修正主义者的操纵和支配下，已经成为反革命、反人民和反华的机构。它阻挠一些革命组织参加进去，但是却欢迎一些从历史垃圾堆里钻出来的反革命修正主义走狗加入他们的行列。它不折不扣地变成了苏修在亚非国家的宣传机器。它参加了克里姆林宫操纵的、总部设在东欧的‘国际组织’。它已变成现代修正主义者进行操纵、搞政治阴谋，搞破坏和秘密活动以及分裂亚非解放运动和亚非团结运动的专门工具。”声明接着指出：“设在开罗的常设书记处已经堕落成为进行恫吓和法西斯独裁的工具。”
    声明郑重宣称：“由于常设书记处采取了这样的行动方针，西南非洲人民的真正代表西南非洲民族联盟不同它发生任何关系，是理所当然的。”
