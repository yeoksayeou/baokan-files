The sky is hazy with a few stars, the window paper is pale with the rooster crowing. Old peasant Song Shan quickly gets up and, upon opening the door, casually picks up a manure basket. He doesn’t bother to look at the scenery in the fields; his mind is filled with thoughts of team leader Xiao Zhao Qi. He wonders how Xiao Zhao Qi is doing. Last night’s meeting was tough on him! The atmosphere in the meeting was serious and the room was crowded. Everyone spoke up, breaking all formalities to voice their opinions: some said he was careless in his work, others said he had a quick temper, some said he didn’t investigate enough, and others said he was subjective in his views. One voice after another, some loud, some soft. Zhao Qi wrote down every point in his notebook and said, “I welcome everyone’s feedback.” Oh, Zhao Qi is generally good, but he has a hot temper and gets anxious easily. I’m just afraid this young team leader, a son of a poor peasant, can’t take such heavy criticism. Thinking and thinking, I wonder, what should I do now? Quickly, let me seek advice from Chairman Mao.

(White): Chairman Mao says, “We must be good at identifying cadres. We should not only look at a cadre’s actions at a particular time, but also at the cadre’s entire history and all his work. This is the main method for identifying cadres.” Chairman Mao’s words shine like gold, each sentence resonating in the heart of the old peasant. Right! I will definitely follow Chairman Mao’s words and help Zhao Qi solve his ideological problems. Raising his head, he sees someone in the field leveling the ground. The young man has thrown his cotton-padded jacket and hat to the side, wielding his shovel with vigor, sweat dripping from his forehead. Old Song Shan walks over and stops, rubbing his eyes to get a better look. The more he looks, the more his heart opens up. Hey! The young man is indeed team leader Xiao Zhao Qi!

Old Song Shan walks up and loudly says, “Xiao Zhao Qi, I never expected it to be you. When did you come to the fields?”

Xiao Zhao Qi replies, “Before the rooster crowed and the sky was still dark.”

Old Song Shan says, “Didn’t you sleep well last night?”

Xiao Zhao Qi says, “Chairman Mao sent us a message, every word touched my heart. ‘Grasp revolution, promote production,’ Chairman Mao’s words I must remember. I tossed and turned all night, thinking about how we must win this spring plowing battle. I thought about our team’s spring plowing, the field without manure is in the west of the village. There’s a small ditch blocking the path, the manure cart can’t get through. Thinking of this, I came to the fields to fill in the ditch so the manure cart can pass.”

Old Song Shan hears this and sighs in relief, his face breaking into a smile, his heart sweet and content. “Last night, everyone had a lot to say. I was afraid you might give up.” Xiao Zhao Qi quickly says, “I can’t do that. I understand the good intentions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. For the revolution, everyone points out my flaws; for the revolution, everyone treats my illness; for the revolution, I’ve had a political bath to wash away the dust and gain strength. I can’t, ignore the bigger picture and hold a grudge; I can’t, have wild thoughts and suspicions. I must, revolutionize my soul; I must, break down selfishness and establish public spirit; I must, be a pioneer in revolution and production; I must, stand tall and carry the red flag!”

Old Song Shan hears this and is overjoyed, repeatedly shouting, “Good Xiao Zhao Qi! You are a good son of the poor peasants. We must stand tall and carry the red flag. We must remember Chairman Mao’s words, go wherever Chairman Mao points!”

    挺起腰杆扛红旗 
    （鼓词）
    晓任天空朦胧星儿稀，窗纸发白公鸡啼，老贫农松山急忙把身起，开门顺手背了个粪箕。田野里风光他没心瞧，心里直念着队长小赵奇。也不知赵奇怎么样，昨晚上开会够他受的！会场上气氛严肃人又挤，大伙儿破开情面把那意见提：有的说他办事不仔细，有的说他遇事爱发脾气，有的说他深入实际调查少，有的说他看问题主观主义……你一言来他一语，一声高来一声低。赵奇他条条都记在小本里，嘴上还说：“欢迎大伙多多提。”唉，要说赵奇样样都不错，就是脾气毛躁爱着急。怕只怕，这个年青队长贫农子弟，这样重的批评经不起。想又想，嗳，如今我该怎么办？快快请教毛主席。（白）：毛主席说：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”毛主席的话字字金光闪，句句说到老贫农心坎儿里。对！我一定听毛主席的话，帮助赵奇解决思想问题。猛抬头，看地里，有个小伙子在平地。只见他，棉袄帽子一旁甩，抡起铁锹干得急，头上腾腾冒热气，脸上汗水往下滴。老松山走到跟前停住步，揉了揉眼睛看仔细，越看心里越舒展，嘿！小伙子正是队长小赵奇！老松山上前高声道：“赵奇呀，我——我没想到会是你，你什么时候就下了地？”赵奇说：“天还没亮鸡没啼。”老松山说：“昨夜你没有睡好觉吧？”赵奇说：“毛主席给咱来了信，句句说到了我的心坎里，‘抓革命，促生产’，毛主席的话儿我要牢记。我翻来复去睡不着觉，想着咱春耕这一仗要打得漂漂亮亮的！我想到咱队闹春耕，没运粪的那块地就在村西，那里一条小沟把路断，运粪大车过不去。想到此我起身来地里，填平沟好叫粪车能过去。”老松山一听轻轻松了口气，脸上含笑心中甜蜜蜜：“昨晚上大伙提的意见可不少，我怕你躺倒不愿起。”赵奇忙说：“我不能那样做呀，我领会贫下中农的好心意。为革命，大伙给我指缺点，为革命，大伙给我把病医；为革命，给我洗了个政治澡为革命，去掉灰尘增力气。我不能，不顾大局生怨气，我不能，胡思乱想瞎猜疑。我一定，灵魂深处闹革命，我一定，大破私字把公字立，我一定，革命生产当闯将，我一定，挺起腰杆扛红旗！”老松山听了心欢喜，连连叫道：“好赵奇！你是咱贫农的好子弟，咱们要挺起腰杆扛红旗。毛主席的话咱们牢牢记，毛主席指向那里咱们就到那里！”
