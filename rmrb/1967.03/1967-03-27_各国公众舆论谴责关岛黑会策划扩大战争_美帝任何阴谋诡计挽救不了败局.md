	International public opinion has been denouncing and criticizing the U.S. imperialists' new conspiracy to further escalate the war in Vietnam, as plotted at the Guam conference. It has been pointed out that the Guam conference cannot save the U.S. imperialists from their inevitable defeat.

	According to a compilation of reports from Xinhua News Agency: Various countries' public opinion has been exposing and criticizing the U.S. imperialists' plot to further escalate the war in Vietnam at the Guam conference, and pointing out that the Guam conference cannot save the U.S. imperialists from their inevitable defeat.

	The editorial board of Albania's "People's Voice" newspaper published an article on the 22nd stating: The fact that Johnson has convened the Honolulu, Manila, and Guam conferences in just one year clearly shows that the main target of U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy is Asia. U.S. imperialism is doing this not only to save its military and political failures but also because the main and well-known goal of its counter-revolutionary global strategy is to raise the banner of Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and revolution, which is the great People's Republic of China. U.S. imperialism sees that China has become an insurmountable obstacle to its evil plans. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, socialist China is advancing with the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing the conspiracies of imperialism and revisionism, and fundamentally shaking the old world.

	The article states that the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war in Vietnam and oppose China has received active and comprehensive support from its close ally, the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	The article concludes by pointing out that Johnson is now plotting new military conspiracies at the Guam conference. However, no tricks can save the U.S. imperialists from the mire. Johnson's new plans to further escalate the aggression against Vietnam and his conspiracies against the People's Republic of China and the peoples of other Asian countries, plotted at the Guam conference, will meet the same fate as his conspiracies plotted at the Honolulu and Manila conferences—ultimate failure and complete bankruptcy.

	The "Spark" newspaper of Romania published a commentary on the 21st pointing out that the recent Guam conference held by U.S. imperialism aims to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam. The commentary states that the Guam conference is another exposure of the hypocrisy of the so-called "peace wishes" propagated by U.S. imperialism. The commentary states that regardless of what measures are taken at the Guam war conference—a link in the chain of aggression—it cannot stop the victory of the just cause of the Vietnamese people, and it will further lead to the bankruptcy of the U.S. policy that seriously endangers peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

	On the 22nd, the famous Burmese writer Du Amah published an article in the "People's News" stating that U.S. President Johnson's plot to further escalate the war in Vietnam at the Guam conference will inevitably meet with increasing failure. She emphasized in conclusion: The U.S. must accept the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam; otherwise, it will meet the deserved fate of an aggressor.

	On the 20th, the "Sun" newspaper of Cambodia published a commentary stating: The conference convened by Johnson in Guam is a "conference to expand the aggression against Vietnam and extend this war to other countries in Southeast Asia." The commentary states: "The convening of this conference shows that the imperialists are struggling." The commentary emphasizes that: "This is not the first time such a conference has been held, and it has already been the tenth time, but there is still no hope. It can be said that the imperialists are heading into a dead end in the Vietnam War."

	On the 20th, the Algerian News Agency commented: "Currently, it is obvious that the military conference in Guam is a prelude to the U.S.'s large-scale military actions in Vietnam." The commentary emphasizes that: "After the failure of the U.S. imperialists' strategy of war and 'peace' in Vietnam, they are now preparing for new military adventures, attempting to save themselves from the fate of complete failure in Asia."

    各国公众舆论谴责关岛黑会策划扩大战争
    美帝任何阴谋诡计挽救不了败局
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国公众舆论纷纷揭露和抨击美帝国主义在关岛会议上策划进一步扩大侵越战争的新阴谋，并指出关岛会议挽救不了美帝国主义的必然失败。
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十二日发表编辑部文章说：约翰逊在一年之内连续召开檀香山、马尼拉和关岛会议这一事实清楚地表明，美帝国主义的反革命全球战略的主要矛头是亚洲。美帝国主义这样做不仅是为了挽救它在军事上、政治上的失败，而且还因为它的反革命全球战略主要的、众所周知的目标，是高举马克思列宁主义旗帜、高举社会主义和革命旗帜的伟大的人民中国。美帝国主义看到，中国已经成为它推行罪恶计划的不可逾越的障碍。社会主义的中国在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，正以无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进军粉碎帝国主义和修正主义的阴谋，并从根本上震撼了旧世界。
    文章说，美帝国主义者扩大侵越战争和反对中国的阴谋，得到它的亲密伙伴苏联修正主义领导人的积极和全面的支持。
    文章最后指出，现在约翰逊又在关岛会议上策划了新的军事阴谋诡计。但是，任何花招都不能把美帝国主义者从泥潭中拯救出来。约翰逊在关岛会议上策划的进一步扩大侵略越南的新计划以及反对中华人民共和国和亚洲其它国家人民的阴谋，也象他在檀香山、马尼拉会议上策划的阴谋一样，必将遭到最后失败和彻底破产。
    罗马尼亚《火花报》二十一日发表评论指出，美帝国主义最近举行关岛会议的目的是加紧侵略越南的战争。评论说，关岛会议是美帝国主义所宣扬的所谓“和平愿望”的虚伪性的又一次暴露。评论说，不管关岛战争会议——侵略行动链条上的一环——通过什么样的措施，但是，它阻挠不了越南人民正义事业的胜利，它将使严重危害东南亚和全世界和平的美国的政策进一步破产。
    缅甸著名作家杜阿玛二十二日在《人民报》上发表文章指出，美国总统约翰逊在关岛会议上策划进一步扩大侵越战争，必将遭到越来越惨的失败。她最后强调说：美国必须接受越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，否则，它必将遭到侵略者的应得下场。
    柬埔寨《太阳报》二十日发表评论指出：约翰逊召集刽子手们在关岛举行的会议是“扩大侵略越南战争并且把这场战争扩大到东南亚其他国家的会议”。评论说：“这次会议的召开表明，帝国主义者正在进行挣扎。”评论强调指出：“关岛会议不是这种会议的第一次了，甚至已经是第十次了，然而这仍然是没有什么希望的。可以说，帝国主义者在越南战争中正在走入死胡同。”
    阿尔及利亚新闻社二十日评论说：“目前，很显然，关岛的军事会议是美国在越南大规模加强军事行动的前奏。”评论强调指出：“美帝国主义由于在越南采用的战争与‘和平’的两手策略遭到失败后走投无路，所以在准备进行新的军事冒险，妄图挽救自己在亚洲遭到彻底失败的命运。”
