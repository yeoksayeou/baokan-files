Morale of U.S. Troops in Vietnam Plummets, Anti-War Sentiment Grows

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 10 — According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, as the U.S. aggressors suffer defeats on the battlefield in South Vietnam, the morale of U.S. troops in Vietnam is crumbling, and soldiers' anti-war sentiments are growing.

In January, a large number of soldiers and some officers from the U.S. 9th Infantry Division, who were sent to South Vietnam to massacre the Vietnamese people, refused to disembark when they arrived at the port of Da Nang. The U.S. military authorities in Vietnam used brutal methods to suppress the soldiers and officers who participated in the anti-war struggle, killing two leaders of the anti-war movement on January 31 and February 2.

It is also reported that the U.S. aggressors have established a prison in the An Hoa area of Tuy Hoa Province to specifically detain U.S. soldiers who oppose the war in South Vietnam. It is estimated that, so far, 800 U.S. soldiers have been imprisoned there.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 10 — Some American soldiers wrote letters to the organ of the Progressive Labor Party of the United States, the monthly "Challenge," expressing strong opposition to the U.S. war in Vietnam and expressing great indignation at the aggressive crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam.

A letter published in the latest issue of "Challenge" by American soldier Dick Wharton says: "I have talked to a few American soldiers who have returned from Vietnam, and they all confirmed many of the atrocities I have read about and heard about in the reports." He said that these atrocities made him feel "angry and hateful."

The soldier said that now he has "seen the light" about what is happening in Vietnam and in the United States. He said: "I and my comrades in the unit are truly cannon fodder."

He expressed that he now "strongly opposes the imperialist war of the United States, opposes its suppression of the freedom fighters in Vietnam, opposes its massacre of women and children, and opposes its savage bombing of peaceful civilians."

In the same issue of "Challenge," another letter from a soldier who enlisted nineteen months ago, Paul Gait, says: "I can no longer believe that the actions of my country's (the United States) government are justified, and I cannot approve of the inhuman, unjust acts happening around me." He expressed strong indignation at the crimes of U.S. imperialism in massacring the Vietnamese people.

Under the heavy blows of the military and people of South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressor forces have suffered repeated defeats and their morale is low. This is the pitiful state of a U.S. soldier.

    侵越美军士气低落，反战情绪日益增长
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，随着美国侵略者在南越战场上的惨败，侵越美军军心涣散，官兵的厌战、反战情绪日益增长。
    今年一月被派往南越屠杀越南人民的美国第九步兵师的大批士兵和一些军官，在被运到头顿港口时，展开反战斗争，坚决拒绝登陆。侵越美军当局对参加反战斗争的官兵采取野蛮的手段进行镇压，在一月三十一日和二月二日，先后打死了两名领导反战斗争的军官。
    另据报道，美国侵略者在土龙木省安和地区建立了一座监狱，专门监禁在越南南方战场上反战的美军官兵。据统计，到目前为止，已有八百名美军官兵被关押在那里。
    新华社伦敦电　一些美国士兵写信给美国进步劳工党的机关报《挑战》月报，表示强烈反对美国侵越战争，并且对美帝国主义在越南犯下的侵略罪行表示极大的愤慨。
    刊登在《挑战》月报最新一期的美国士兵迪克·惠顿的信说：“我同从越南回来的几个美国兵谈过话，他们都证实了我在报上读到和听到的许多（美军）暴行。”他说，这种暴行使他感到“愤怒和憎恨”。
    这个士兵说，现在他对在越南以及在美国国内发生的事情“恍然大悟了”。他说：“我和部队里我的伙伴们都是名副其实的炮灰。”
    他表示，他现在“非常强烈地反对美国的帝国主义战争，反对它镇压越南的自由战士，反对它残杀妇孺，反对它残暴地狂轰滥炸和平居民。”
    在同一期《挑战》月报上发表的另一封信中，一个在十九个月以前入伍的士兵保罗·盖特说：“我再也不能认为我国（美国）政府的行动是有道理的了，我也不能赞同在我周围所发生的那些非人的不义行为。”他对美帝国主义残杀越南人民的罪行表示强烈的愤怒。
