On March 6, the officers and soldiers of the Third Artillery Battery of a certain unit, with a fighting posture, carrying Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party Central Committee's directives, along with their beloved works of Chairman Mao, faced the rising sun in the east and arrived at the frontline of spring ploughing production—the Tangshan City Brigade in Fengcheng, Liaoning Province, Tangshan City Production Team. They immediately joined the production battle. Upon arrival, they discovered that in the fertilizer and manure collection sites and along the riverbanks where dikes and dams were being built, the participants were mostly elderly and weak semi-laborers and female members; most of the manure being transported to the fields was carried by people, with very few using carts.

"Where are the main labor forces of the team?"
"Where are the vehicles and draft animals?"
"Why is the spring ploughing preparation work so cold and desolate?"

They conducted door-to-door investigations.

It turned out that this team had undertaken a task of transporting 12,500 cubic meters of sand last year, which would take a year to complete. All the main labor forces and vehicles of the entire team were sent to transport sand.

Why not earlier or later, but specifically during this critical spring ploughing season?

The leaders of the Third Battery studied a large amount of investigation materials and, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, held a meeting of the branch committee for discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that this was a plot by some malicious individuals who, under the guise of increasing the income of the team members, aimed to disrupt spring ploughing production and the Cultural Revolution.

Thus, a new struggle began!

Chairman Mao said: "It should be admitted that some of the masses often pay more attention to immediate, partial, and personal interests, and do not understand or do not fully understand long-term, national, and collective interests.... Therefore, it is necessary to conduct lively and practical political education among the masses." The officers and soldiers of the Third Battery, following Chairman Mao's instructions, first strengthened the ideological work in the Sixth Production Team.

After work, Platoon Leader Liu Chengguo and the soldiers hurried to the Sixth Production Team in the dark. The team office was bustling with people, and everyone was discussing something. Liu, the platoon leader, discussed with the squad leader Xin Yixuan and decided to seize the opportunity to let Mao Zedong Thought directly meet the masses, letting the masses educate themselves. Squad Leader Xin Yixuan first repeatedly read Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's letters to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels at the community meeting.

Chairman Mao's call was like dew nourishing the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Old poor peasant Yu Dejiang pondered repeatedly. Chairman Mao's call aroused a sense of responsibility in this old poor peasant who had suffered much in the old society, and it also aroused a sense of responsibility in all the poor and lower-middle peasants present.

At this moment, the new soldier Fan Dexi walked among the crowd and recited a passage from Chairman Mao: "At present, during the spring ploughing season, I hope that all leaders, cadres, and masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production and achieve greater results than last year." Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority and the greatest power; one sentence is worth ten thousand. Old poor peasant Yu Dejiang could no longer hold back and stood up excitedly, saying:

"Right now, the spring ploughing work is as urgent as a fire on the roof. We abandon it and go to transport sand. We have taken the wrong path! What we do and say is not in line with what Chairman Mao says." Yu Dejiang's words expressed the feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasant team members, and people began to discuss enthusiastically.

Seizing the opportunity, the platoon leader and soldiers had heart-to-heart talks with each poor and lower-middle peasant.

Team Leader Zheng Yuqi, enlightened by Platoon Leader Liu Chengguo, thought about Chairman Mao's teachings and his own political complacency, and shed tears of shame. He angrily exposed the wolfish ambitions of some malicious elements. When Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's letters were just issued, a handful of bad elements threatened him, saying: "Comrade Zheng, you are the leader of the team. The livelihood of all team members is in your hands. Transporting sand is a highly profitable way to make money! What spring ploughing preparation? If the sideline business is well done, even if not a single grain of rice is harvested, the labor value will not be reduced by a single penny..." Before he could finish, old poor peasant Gao Yunshen was so angry that he said: "These bad elements are truly 'tigers wearing Buddhist beads, pretending to be good people.' What concern for the livelihood of team members? Purely using the pretext of transporting sand to delay the preparation time and disrupt spring ploughing production. Each class speaks its own language; a dog's mouth cannot spit out jade. We farmers, for the revolution, farming is our duty. We don't covet those few work points, nor do we covet the money from transporting sand. What we want is to 'grasp revolution and promote production,' to follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

At the same time, the members of the Third Production Team, under the guidance of the Third Battery's soldiers, also recognized the seriousness of this struggle. Poor peasant team member Hu De said with deep feeling: "If we don't keep class struggle in mind, production will not go well! It's still our comrades in the army who said it well! 'To use revolution to lead production,' if we don't put revolution first, the more sand we transport and the more money we make, the farther we will be from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the end, we will still have to live a life of being beasts of burden. This is something we cannot do."

Mao Zedong Thought grasped the masses, the masses became aware, the malicious elements were isolated, and their plots were foiled. The spring ploughing preparation work in the entire team immediately began in a grand and vigorous manner.

    抓阶级斗争　促春耕生产
    解放军某部炮三连发动群众粉碎了敌人破坏春耕的阴谋
    三月六日，某部炮三连干部、战士以战斗的姿态，带着毛主席、党中央的指示，带着他们心爱的毛主席著作，迎着东方的朝阳，来到了春耕生产的第一线——辽宁凤城汤山城公社汤山城大队，立即投入了生产战斗。他们一开始就发现：在积肥运粪的现场，在修堤筑坝的河边，参加劳动的大都是年大体弱的半劳力和妇女社员；往地里送粪，多数是用人担，很少用车。
      “队里的主要劳力哪里去了？”“车辆牲畜哪里去了？”“为什么春耕备耕工作这么冷冷清清？”
    他们就挨门挨户地进行了访问调查。
    原来这个大队去年包揽了一万二千五百立方米的运砂副业任务，今年一年内才能完成。全大队的主要劳动力和车辆都去运砂子了。
    为什么早不拉，晚不拉，偏偏在这“只争朝夕”的春耕时节来拉呢？
    三连的领导同志根据大量的调查材料，对照了毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，召开支委会进行研究，大家一致认为：这是一些别有用心的人，迎合一些落后群众的自私心理，企图以增加社员收入为名，行破坏春耕生产，破坏文化大革命之实。
    于是，一场新的斗争开始了！
    毛主席说：“应该承认：有些群众往往容易注意当前的、局部的、个人的利益，而不了解或者不很了解长远的、全国性的、集体的利益。……因此，需要在群众中间经常进行生动的、切实的政治教育”。三连干部、战士遵照毛主席这一教导，首先加强了第六生产队的思想工作。
    收工后，排长刘程国和战士们摸黑赶到第六生产队。队部里人群熙熙攘攘，大家正在议论着什么。刘排长同班长信义轩商量了一下，决定因势利导，让毛泽东思想直接同群众见面，让群众自己教育自己。班长信义轩首先在社员会上反复宣读了毛主席和党中央给贫下中农和各级干部的信。
    毛主席的号召象雨露一样滋润着贫下中农的心。
    老贫农于德江反复思量着。毛主席的号召引起了这个饱尝旧社会辛酸的老贫农的责任感，也引起了全体到会的贫下中农的责任感。
    这当儿，新战士范德华走到群众之中，背诵了毛主席这样一段话：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，一句顶一万句。老贫农于德江听到这里，再也憋不住了，霍地站起来，激动地说：
      “眼下，春耕活计象火上房一样的急，咱们扔下不干，去拉砂子，我们的道走错了！我们做的、干的和毛主席他老人家说的不是一码事。”于德江的话，道出了贫下中农社员的心里话，人们七嘴八舌的议论开了。
    趁热打铁，把思想工作做到每个人的心坎上。排长和战士们，同贫下中农一个一个地亲切交谈。
    生产队长郑玉奎在排长刘程国的启发下，想想毛主席他老人家的教导，想想自己政治上的麻痹，流下了惭愧的眼泪。他愤怒地起来揭露一些别有用心的坏分子的狼子野心。当毛主席和党中央的信刚发下来的时候，一小撮坏家伙就要挟他说：“郑队长，你是一队之长，全队社员的生活攥在你手心里，拉砂子可是一本万利的来钱路啊！什么备耕不备耕的，搞好了副业，就是一粒粮食不收，劳日值也少不了一个钱……。”还没等他说完，老贫农高云臣气得不得了，他说：“这些坏家伙真是‘老虎挂念珠，假装善人’，什么关心社员生活，纯粹是想用拉砂子为名，拖延备耕时间，破坏春耕生产。什么阶级说什么话，狗嘴里吐不出象牙来，咱庄稼人，为革命种田是咱的本分。咱不希罕那几个工分，更不希罕去运砂子搞几个臭钱，咱要的是‘抓革命，促生产’，要的是毛主席的革命路线。”
    在这同时，第三生产队的社员在三连指战员的开导下，也认清了这场斗争的严重性，贫农社员驭手胡德深有体会地说：“不把阶级斗争装在心里，生产就搞不好哇！还是咱队伍上的同志说得好哇！‘要用革命统帅生产’，不把革命放在头前，这砂子拉得越多，钱挣得越多，离毛主席他老人家的革命路线就越远了，到头来咱们还得过当牛做马的生活，这事可干不得。”
    毛泽东思想掌握了群众，群众觉悟了，别有用心的坏家伙孤立了，阴谋破产了。全大队的备耕工作立即轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
