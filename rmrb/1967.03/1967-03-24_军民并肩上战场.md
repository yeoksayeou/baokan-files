A thunderous spring call awakens the nation,
Seven hundred million hearts beat as one,
The drums of spring stir the earth,
Soldiers and civilians march together to the battlefield.

(Spoken) Chairman Mao says: "At present, it is the spring planting season. I hope that all leaders, cadres, and the masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production season and achieve even greater results than last year."

The story takes place by the Luan River in the eastern part of Hebei. There is a small village called Xiangyang Village. On this day, the village is bustling with excitement and joy. From the eastern part of the village, a few young men come over, led by Liu Haijiang. They are holding a stack of newspapers with bright red headlines. They go from house to house, spreading the news. Liu Haijiang walks into a house and shouts, "Grandma!"

"Coming!" the old woman replies.

"Grandma, Chairman Mao has sent us a letter! Come out and listen!"

The old woman, hearing that Chairman Mao has sent a letter, comes out happily. She quickly approaches and carefully examines the newspaper, asking, "Haijiang, what does it say?"

"Yes, Grandma!" Haijiang replies.

"Read it to me so I can understand it clearly!"

Haijiang eagerly says, "Sure, sure, I'll explain it all to you from the beginning."

(Spoken) The letter says: "Dear poor and lower-middle peasants! Chairman Mao calls on you, the Party Central Committee calls on you, hoping that you will earnestly grasp the revolution, promote production, mobilize all forces, and immediately work hard to ensure a good spring planting season."

The old woman, after hearing the letter, is so moved that tears well up in her eyes: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in my heart. You are connected with us poor and lower-middle peasants. You always think of us. What you wrote in the letter is exactly what I have in my heart. 'Grasp the revolution, promote production.' Even I, an old woman, want to be a hero!"

The old woman speaks with increasing enthusiasm. Haijiang continues, "Grandma!"

"Yes!"

"There's another piece of good news."

(Interspersed speech) "What good news?"

"The PLA is coming to support our spring planting. They brought four volumes of precious books to help us arm our minds."

The old woman says, "No matter how much help, the most important thing is to help with our minds."

Haijiang agrees, "Yes, yes, the PLA sets an example in everything. They also brought a repair team with electricians, carpenters, and blacksmiths. They will repair water wheels, install gates, weld buckets, and fix carrying poles..."

The old woman says, "What you said is truly good."

Haijiang says, "Of course, good things come one after another!

(Spoken) "There's also a five-good soldier from the army who has come."

(Interspersed speech) "Who is it?"

"Who? It's your son, Li Xiaogang."

The old woman shakes her head, "Go away, go away, you're talking nonsense. My Xiaogang sent a letter a few days ago, how could he be here today? The army is a hundred miles away from our village, he would have to grow wings to come here!"

As the old woman finishes speaking, the sound of drums and gongs fills the air from all directions.

"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!" The cheers are like a roaring sea.

Haijiang, hearing the cheers, speaks excitedly, "Grandma, listen, that's the sound of the spring planting drums. We're about to go to the battlefield. Today, we're digging a water canal in the eastern part of the village, and the villagers will compete with the PLA."

Saying this, he turns and walks out quickly. The old woman says, "Wait, wait, I want to make some bean soup for the soldiers."

The PLA marches a hundred miles without stopping, continuing the tradition of fighting without rest. The medical team is busy treating illnesses, the ironwork team's hammers ring out, the carpenters' saws cut through wood, and the electricians check the power boxes. Xiangyang Village is bustling with activity, and the labor songs echo through the mountains.

At this moment, the old woman carries a large bucket of water, coming to deliver bean soup to the soldiers. Just as she steps out of the village, she sees the construction site: red flags dancing, songs ringing out, the PLA leading the way, the villagers following closely, pushing, carrying, shouldering, and lifting. Despite the cold, they sweat profusely. Everyone is like the legendary Yu Gong, determined to overcome all difficulties and achieve victory.

Suddenly, the rest signal sounds on the construction site. The old woman puts down her bucket and looks around, "Oh, over there—the PLA is reading 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' to the villagers. Over there—the PLA is discussing thoughts with the cadres. Over there—the PLA is teaching how to sing quotations. Over there—the PLA's performance is truly strong."

The old woman is captivated by the scene. Haijiang comes to her side.

"Grandma!"

"Yes!"

"Have you seen your Xiaogang?"

"Hmm, there are so many soldiers, how can I recognize which one is Xiaogang? They all wear red stars, red badges, green uniforms, and have strong, red faces. They all look the same to me."

(Spoken) Yes, that's true. Haijiang says, "Grandma, look over there, the one telling stories is Xiaogang."

The old woman says, "Yes, it's Xiaogang. I haven't seen my child in two years. He has grown so much. He is tall and strong, recites Chairman Mao's quotations fluently, and works harder than before. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's nurturing. If he were at home, I couldn't have taught him like this."

The old woman is overjoyed. Suddenly, Xiaogang calls out, "Mother!"

"Yes! Xiaogang, you... you didn't mention this in your letter a few days ago, how did you come to our village today?"

Xiaogang says, "Chairman Mao sent the letter yesterday, and our unit set out with our backpacks. To achieve a double victory in revolution and production, and to win the first battle of spring planting, we set out last night. By dawn, we happened to arrive at our village. Because the task of fighting the water canal is urgent, we didn't have time to go home to see you."

Xiaogang's selfless dedication is praised by everyone. At this moment, the drums on the construction site beat louder and louder, one beat stronger than the next. This is the scene: soldiers and civilians fighting together in revolution, united and strong as steel. Xiangyang Village is a sea of red, and the songs of victory echo everywhere!

### 军民并肩上战场

    军民并肩上战场
    王佩琈一声春雷震天响，七亿神州红旗扬，催春战鼓撼大地，军民并肩上战场。
  （白）毛主席说：“目前正
  当春耕时节，希望一切
  解放区的领导同志、工
  作人员、人民群众，不
  失时机地掌握生产环
  节，取得比去年更大的
  成绩。”说的是冀东滦河旁，有个小村叫向阳庄，这一天村里好热闹，一片欢腾喜洋洋。村东头过来几个小伙子，为首的名叫刘海江。他们手里拿着一叠报纸，报上的红字闪金光。走东家，串西家，挨门挨户宣传忙。只见海江走到一家大门
  里，扯着嗓子喊大娘：“大娘！”“哎！”“毛主席给咱来信啦，您快出来听端详！”老大娘一听是毛主席来了
  信，高高兴兴走出了房。赶紧上前仔细看，手摸着报纸问短长：“海江啊！”“哎！”“快给大娘念一念，叫俺心里早亮堂！”海江忙说“好好好，俺从头到尾给您讲。”
  （白）信上说：贫下中农
  同志们！“毛主席号召
  你们，党中央号召你们，
  希望你们认真地抓革
  命，促生产，动员一切力
  量，立即为做好春耕生
  产而积极工作。”老大娘听完这封信，激动得热泪润眼眶：
  “毛主席啊毛主席，您是俺心中的红太阳。您和俺贫下中农心连心，您处处为咱们来着想。您信上写的这桩事儿，句句说在俺心坎上。‘抓革命，促生产’。俺老婆子也要当闯将！”大娘越说劲越大，海江接着开了腔：“大娘！”“哎！”“还有一个好消息。”
  （夹白）“啥好消息？”“解放军支援春耕到咱庄。他们带着四卷宝书，帮咱把思想来武装。”大娘说：“千帮忙，万帮忙，最重要的是帮思想。”海江连说：“对对对，解放军处处给咱做榜样。他们还带着个修理组，有电工木工和铁匠，修水车，安闸箱，焊水桶，修抬筐……”大娘说：“你讲的这些可真
  好。”海江说：“那当然，好事一
  桩接一桩！
  （白）“部队上有个五好战
  士也来啦。”
  （夹白）“是谁呀？”“谁？是您的儿子李小
  刚。”大娘听罢直摇头：“去去去，这话说的可不
  在行。俺小刚前两天才来了信，今儿个咋能到咱庄？部队离咱村百十里，要来除非生了翅膀！”老大娘话音刚落地，锣鼓喧天响四方。
  “毛主席万岁！万万岁！”欢呼声就象倒海又翻江。海江一听欢呼声，眉飞色舞把话讲：“大娘，你听，这就是春耕战鼓声声响，马上就要上战场。今天村东修水渠，社员们要跟解放军赛一
  场。”说罢转身大步往外走，大娘说：“慢慢慢，俺老婆
  子也要给解放军去烧豆
  汤。”解放军行军百里不歇脚，连续作战的传统大发扬。医疗队，查病忙，铁工组，锤声响，木工大锯唰唰唰，电工检修变电箱。向阳庄上热腾腾，劳动战歌震山岗。这时大娘挑着大水桶，来给战士送豆汤。刚刚走出村庄外，就看到，工地上：红旗舞，歌声扬，解放军，打头阵，社员们，紧跟上，推的推，抬的抬，挑的挑，扛的扛，天寒地冻全不怕，浑身上下汗直淌。个个都象活愚公，
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，
  排除万难，去争取胜
  利”的语录号子震天
  响。忽听工地上响起休息号，老大娘放下水桶四处望：“哟，这一边——解放军正给社员读‘毛
  选’，噢，那一边——解放军正跟干部谈思想，啊，这角上——解放军正在教唱语录歌，哎，那角上——解放军节目演的真叫强。”老大娘看得着了迷，海江来到她身旁。“大娘！”“哎！”“看见您们小刚了吗？”“嗨！解放军，这么多，俺知道哪个是小刚？都是戴的红五星，都是缀的红领章，都是穿的绿军服，个个都是红脸膛，都有股子虎实劲儿，咋看着都是一个样。”
  （白）对，这话一点也不
  假。海江说：“大娘你往那角角
  上瞧，说快板的那个是小刚。”大娘说：“嗯，是小刚，两
  年没见俺孩子面，现在大大变了样。个子高了一脑袋，身架结实粗又壮，毛主席语录背的熟，劳动也比过去强。这都是毛主席他老人家培
  养的好，要在家俺可教不成这个
  样。”老大娘乐得合不上嘴，忽听小刚喊了声娘。“娘！”“哎！小刚你……你前几天
  来信没提这码事儿，咋今儿个就到咱们庄？”小刚说：“毛主席昨天发的
  信，俺部队背起背包离了营
  房。为夺取革命生产双胜利，为打好春耕第一仗，昨天晚上就出发，天一亮，可巧来到咱们
  庄。只因为大战水渠任务紧，没顾上回家去看娘。”小刚为公忘私风格好，大家听了直鼓掌。这时候，工地战鼓声声
  紧，一阵更比一阵强。这正是：军民并肩闹革命，团结战斗坚如钢。向阳庄上一片红，生产凯歌四处扬！（附图片）
