The Johnson administration faces immense, fatal, and insurmountable difficulties in the Vietnam War. Whether it repeatedly escalates the war or resorts to endless "war to pressure peace" schemes, it cannot escape these difficulties. The arrogance of the U.S. aggressors is only temporary, and it does not indicate their strength but rather their extreme weakness. As Chairman Mao taught us: "The strength of U.S. imperialism is only superficial and temporary. The various irreconcilable contradictions within and outside the country are like a volcano, threatening U.S. imperialism every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano."

	Injuries Increasing, Morale Low

The U.S. aggressors are in a desperate situation on the battlefield in South Vietnam. The number of U.S. troops in Vietnam has increased from 23,000 in 1964 to 423,000 today. The military expenditure for the Vietnam War has increased from $5.8 billion two years ago to over $20 billion now. The consumption of ammunition has reached 1.7 million artillery shells and 1 billion rifle and pistol bullets per month. However, in the face of the people's war, the heavily armed U.S. aggressors are still passive and taking blows everywhere, suffering heavy losses, and at a loss for what to do.

This year, the large-scale "sweeps," "searches," and "pursuits" launched by the U.S. aggressors in the liberated areas of Xining Province, the "Iron Triangle," and the Mekong Delta have all ended in failure. The facts show that no matter how many more troops Johnson sends, no matter how many more B-52 bombers and helicopters he adds, or no matter how many more cannons he brings in, he cannot reverse the declining trend of the U.S. military in South Vietnam.

The defeat of the U.S. aggressors is most evident in the increasing number of casualties. In 1964, the number of U.S. casualties in South Vietnam was only 2,140. Last year, it increased dramatically to 100,800. According to the significantly reduced figures released by the U.S. Department of Defense on March 16 this year, the number of U.S. casualties this year has increased by 33% compared to the same period last year. It is expected that the number of casualties will increase significantly in the second half of the year. In a situation where U.S. manpower is already severely insufficient, this is a fatal blow to Johnson's Vietnam War policy.

Those U.S. soldiers who do not know why they are fighting and for whom they are fighting in a foreign land are becoming increasingly demoralized. Over the past two years, many U.S. soldiers sent to South Vietnam as cannon fodder have developed from war-weariness and anti-war sentiments to refusing to fight. According to incomplete statistics, since the large-scale U.S. invasion of South Vietnam in March 1965, there have been more than 50 significant incidents of soldiers refusing to fight.

	Military Expenditure Soaring, Financial Crisis Looming

The Vietnam War has brought about very serious consequences for the U.S. economy and finances. During the Kennedy administration, the large-scale military buildup of the U.S. ruling class had already pushed the U.S. military expenditure to the limit. The Johnson administration's escalation of the Vietnam War has pushed the U.S. military expenditure to $73 billion, far exceeding the military expenditure during the Korean War and reaching the highest level during World War II. Under such a heavy burden, with a deficit of over $100 billion each year, the Johnson administration has decided to increase income tax by 6%. The head of U.S. imperialism has also declared that this additional tax will not be canceled as long as the war continues. Due to the threefold increase in the price hike last year, the purchasing power of the American people has been greatly weakened. Now, with the decision to increase taxes again, it will inevitably lead to further market contraction and accelerate the arrival of the "overproduction" crisis.

Moreover, due to the Vietnam War, the U.S. loses $9 billion in foreign exchange each year in South Vietnam, which has become the biggest loophole in Johnson's efforts to stop the outflow of dollars and balance international payments. Obviously, as long as the Vietnam War continues, this loophole cannot be plugged. Currently, the U.S. Treasury has only $13 billion in gold reserves, while foreigners hold over $30 billion in U.S. dollars and dollar-denominated bonds that can be redeemed for gold at any time. In such an unfavorable situation, continuing to allow this loophole to exist is tantamount to a suicide policy on the dollar issue, further eroding the U.S.'s financial hegemony in the capitalist world.

Another headache for the Johnson administration is the enormous transportation volume, long transportation lines, and severe shortage of transportation equipment caused by the long-distance expedition. According to U.S. media reports, last year alone, the monthly volume of military supplies shipped to South Vietnam by sea increased from over 300,000 tons to over 700,000 tons, with 510 ships used and 30 flights of giant transport planes per day to transport military personnel and cargo. However, it is still impossible to change the severe shortage of equipment and insufficient supply of military weapons and materials on the battlefield in South Vietnam. As the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam continues to increase and the scale of the war continues to expand, the enormous difficulties in logistics and transportation are not difficult to imagine.

	Growing Anti-War Sentiment Among the American People

The Vietnam War launched by U.S. imperialism has inevitably intensified class contradictions within the U.S. This unjust war of aggression is fundamentally contrary to the interests of the American people. The broad masses of the American people are becoming increasingly aware, and the tide of their opposition to the Vietnam War is rising.

In recent years, the struggle of the American people against Johnson's aggression in Vietnam has developed. The two nationwide anti-Vietnam War demonstrations on March 25 and August 6 last year were the best examples. In New York alone, tens of thousands of people participated in the protest rallies demanding an end to this criminal war. At the same time, the struggle against the Vietnam War is increasingly merging with the struggle against conscription, class oppression, and racial discrimination by the U.S. government. This further shakes the rear base and stronghold of U.S. imperialism's external aggression and makes it even more difficult for them to recruit cannon fodder.

The Vietnam War has also intensified contradictions within the U.S. ruling class. The so-called "hawks" fiercely attack Johnson's administration for being indecisive and not daring to use more aggressive war escalation tactics to solve the problem. The so-called "doves" criticize Johnson's administration for not being more skillful in using counter-revolutionary tactics to get the U.S. out of the passive situation of being beaten all over the world. This argument reflects the serious difficulties and failures of the U.S. in the Vietnam War.

	Isolated and Helpless on the International Stage

U.S. imperialism is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the people's war in Vietnam, suffering more and more defeats, disrupting its plan for global domination, and exposing its paper tiger image of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside to the people of the world.

As the self-proclaimed international police, U.S. imperialism has been able to bully the world mainly by relying on its 300,000-strong military force. However, with the shift of U.S. strategic focus to the East, over 700,000 of its troops have been bogged down in Vietnam and the Pacific region, unable to move. The U.S. troops stationed in other parts of the world are already scattered. This has greatly weakened the U.S.'s control over Western Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. The military alliances painstakingly assembled by U.S. imperialism, such as NATO, CENTO, and SEATO, have become paralyzed, disintegrated, or exist in name only. France and West Germany, among other Western European countries, are taking further actions to break free from U.S. control. Especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the national liberation movements are thriving, and new revolutionary storms are ready to erupt at any time. This makes it even more difficult for the Johnson administration to cope. U.S. imperialism has never been as isolated, as lacking in support, and as beset with difficulties as it is today.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are forces that are close to death and have no future." The difficulties of the U.S. aggressors are escalating with the escalation of the Vietnam War and expanding with the expansion of the Vietnam War. They cannot overcome the difficulties they encounter in this Vietnam War but will only be dragged down by this Vietnam War. The Johnson administration's repeated use of the "war to pressure peace" trick has proven that U.S. imperialism fears a prolonged war the most. As long as the Vietnamese people keep the tens of thousands of U.S. aggressors bogged down and fight on resolutely, they will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory.

### 美帝在侵越战争中的困难是不可克服的

    美帝在侵越战争中的困难是不可克服的
    约翰逊政府在侵越战争中面临的困难是巨大的、致命的、不可克服的。它一再采取战争“升级”行动也好，玩弄层出不穷的“以战压和”阴谋也好，都不能摆脱这种困难。美国侵略者嚣张一时，但丝毫也不表明它的强大，而是恰恰相反，表明了它的极端虚弱。正象毛主席教导我们的：美帝国主义的“强大，只是表面的和暂时的。国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
        伤亡剧增　士气低落
    美帝国主义侵略者在南越战场上已经处于走投无路的困境中。美国侵略军人数从一九六四年的两万三千人增加到最近的四十二万三千人。美国用于越南作战的军费从两年前的一年五十八亿美元增加到现在的二百多亿美元，弹药的消耗达到每月一百七十万发炮弹，一亿发步枪和手枪子弹的天文数字。但是，在南越战场上，在人民战争的威力面前，武装到牙齿的美国侵略军仍然是处处被动，处处挨打，伤亡惨重，一筹莫展。
    今年以来，美国侵略军对西宁省解放区、“铁三角”、湄公河三角洲等地区发动的大规模“扫荡”、“搜查和追捕”，无不一一扑空，遭到惨败。事实表明，约翰逊政府不论增派多少侵略军，不论增加多少架B—52轰炸机和直升飞机，也不论增加多少门大炮，都无法挽救美军在南越的颓势。
    美国侵略军的惨败，最明显地反映在伤亡数字的激增上。一九六四年南越战场上的美军伤亡人数还只有二千一百四十人，去年急剧增加到十万零八千人。据美国国防部今年三月十六日发表的大大缩小了的数字承认，今年美军伤亡人数又比去年头三个月增加了百分之三十三。下半年预料伤亡还要大幅度增加。在美国兵员已感严重不足的今天，这种情况是对约翰逊政府侵越战争政策的一个最致命的打击。
    那些不知道到万里外的异国去为何而战和为谁而战的美军士兵，士气越来越低落。两年多来，被送到南越战场充当炮灰的不少美国士兵已从厌战、反战而发展到拒战。据不完全统计，从一九六五年三月美国侵略军大举入侵南越以来，已经发生了五十多起较大的拒战行动。
        军费扶摇直上　财政漏洞百出
    侵越战争给美国的财政和经济带来十分严重的后果。在肯尼迪政府时，美国统治集团的大规模扩军备战，本来就已使美国的军费负担紧张到了极点。约翰逊政府扩大侵越战争的结果，美国军费再度扶摇直上，竟达到了七百三十亿美元，大大超过侵朝战争军费而达到第二次世界大战最高峰时期美国军费的水平。在这样一笔沉重的负担下，眼看着每年都要出现一百多亿美元的巨大赤字，约翰逊政府终于不得不决定增加所得税百分之六。这个美帝国主义的头子还扬言，战争一日不停，这笔附加税就不取消。由于去年物价上涨速度三倍于前年，美国人民购买力已经大大削弱。现在又决定再度增税，这就必然要引起市场进一步萎缩，加速生产“过剩”危机的到来。
    不仅如此，由于侵越战争使美国每年要在南越流失九亿美元的巨额外汇，这已成为约翰逊政府千方百计堵塞美元外流、平衡国际收支的一个最大漏洞。显然，侵越战争只要一日不停止，这个漏洞就一日不能堵塞。目前美国国库只剩下一百三十亿美元的黄金储备，而外国人手中持有的可以随时向美国兑取黄金的美钞和美元债券已超过三百亿美元。在这样一个不利局势下，让这个漏洞继续存在下去，这就无异是在美元问题上实行自杀政策，从而使美国进一步丧失它在资本主义世界的金融霸主地位。
    使约翰逊政府大伤脑筋的还有劳师远征所造成的运输量巨大、运输线过长、运输工具严重缺乏的种种困难。据美国报刊透露，去年单是从海路运往南越的军需品每月就从三十多万吨激增到七十多万吨，动用船只达五百一十艘，运送军事人员和货物的巨型运输机一天就达三十架次。但是仍然无法改变南越战场上装备极端缺乏，军火物资供应不足的严重现象。随着侵越美军的继续不断增加，战争规模不断扩大，后勤运输的巨大困难更是不难想象的了。
        美国人民反对侵越斗争高涨
    美帝国主义发动的侵越战争，不能不加剧美国国内的阶级矛盾。这场非正义的侵略战争，同美国人民的利益是根本相违背的。美国广大人民正在进一步觉醒起来，他们反对侵越战争的浪潮越来越高涨。
    近年来，美国人民抗议约翰逊政府侵略越南的斗争有新的发展。去年三月二十五日和八月六日两次席卷美国全国的反对侵越战争大示威，就是最好的说明。仅纽约一地参加抗议集会、要求停止这场罪恶战争的就有好几万人。同时，反对侵越战争的斗争正在日益同拒绝服兵役、反对美国政府进行阶级压迫和种族迫害的斗争结合起来。这就进一步震撼着美帝国主义对外侵略的大后方和总基地，并使它搜罗炮灰的工作，更加变得困难起来。
    侵越战争也使美国统治集团内部的矛盾日益加剧。所谓“鹰派”，竭力攻击约翰逊政府瞻前顾后，不敢用更厉害的战争“升级”手段解决问题。所谓“鸽派”，则抨击约翰逊政府未能更巧妙地运用反革命两手策略，使美国摆脱在全世界被动挨打的局面。这种争吵反映了美国在侵越战争中的严重困难和失败。
    国际上失道寡助困难重重
    美帝国主义在越南人民战争的泥坑中越陷越深，越败越惨，使它称霸全球的计划被打乱，在全世界人民面前更加暴露出自己外强中干的纸老虎丑态。
    以国际宪兵自居的美帝国主义在全世界之所以能够横行霸道，主要是凭借着它那一支三百多万人的庞大军队。但是随着美国战略重点的东移，它的七十万以上的军队被牵制在越南和太平洋地区，动弹不得。美国驻扎国外其他地方的部队已分得很散。这就使美国对西欧、中东和拉丁美洲的控制力量大大削弱。美帝国主义苦心拼凑的军事集团，北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织和东南亚条约组织，已陷于瘫痪、解体或名存实亡。法国和西德等西欧大陆国家，已在进一步采取行动来摆脱美国的控制。特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展，随时都会爆发新的革命风暴。这就使约翰逊政府更加难以应付。美帝国主义在国际上从来没有象今天这样孤立，这样失道寡助，这样困难重重。
    毛主席教导我们：“反动势力的困难是不可能克服的，因为他们是接近于死亡的没有前途的势力。”美国侵略者的困难正在随着侵越战争的“升级”而升级，随着侵越战争的扩大而扩大。它不可能克服在这场侵越战争中所遇到的困难，而只会被这场侵越战争所拖垮。约翰逊政府一再玩弄“以战压和”的花招，有力地证明了美帝国主义最怕战争长期拖下去。越南人民只要把美国几十万侵略军拖住，坚决打下去，打到底，就一定能够置美国侵略者于死地，取得最后胜利。
