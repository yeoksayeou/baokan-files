In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many cadres, due to their bourgeois worldviews not being transformed or not being thoroughly transformed, were timid and selfish, consciously or unconsciously executing the bourgeois reactionary line, committing errors of varying degrees. For cadres who have made mistakes, we have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policies on cadres, firmly opposed erroneous practices that go against Mao Zedong Thought, and striven to unite and win over the majority of cadres.

Be Bold and Resolutely Unite with Revolutionary Leading Cadres

Revolutionary leading cadres are the Party's precious assets and the backbone of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Whether or not to resolutely rely on revolutionary leading cadres is the key to whether the proletarian revolutionary faction can achieve victory in seizing power from the handful of capitalists within the Party. On this issue, our school has witnessed a sharp struggle between two lines of thought: one is to doubt and reject everything; the other is to fully trust and resolutely rely on revolutionary cadres. The issue of Mu Guoxing, a former member of the Party Committee and deputy head of the Propaganda Department, vividly reflects this struggle between the two lines of thought.

From the outset of the movement, Comrade Mu Guoxing led revolutionary teachers and students in exposing the problems of the institute's Party Committee and was labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by the handful of capitalists within the Party. After the "Sixteen Points" were issued, revolutionary teachers and students bravely fought back against the handful of capitalists within the Party, and he stood firmly on the side of the revolutionaries, fighting alongside revolutionary teachers and students and actively doing ideological work among deceived cadres and the masses. We believe that although Comrade Mu Guoxing had some shortcomings and mistakes in the past, he has always stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in critical moments of class struggle and is a force that we red rebels resolutely rely on. The "August 8th Corps," acting on the orders of the handful of capitalists within the Party, harbored deep hatred for revolutionary cadres who dared to fight alongside the Red Rebel Corps. They labeled Comrade Mu Guoxing as a "political thief" and "inciter of factional struggles," using the pretext of "exposing the backers of the rebel faction" to attack and struggle against him multiple times, attempting to strike at revolutionary cadres, dismantle the Red Rebel Corps, and protect the handful of capitalists within the Party. A small number of comrades within the Red Rebel Corps, influenced by this reactionary tide, were afraid of being labeled "conservatives" and dared not rely on Comrade Mu Guoxing. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, we realized that not daring to trust, support, or rely on cadres who have passed the test of class struggle is a manifestation of being "left in form but right in essence." The revolutionary nature of the proletarian revolutionary faction is not only shown in daring to firmly struggle against the handful of capitalists within the Party but also in daring to unite with revolutionary cadres who adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Based on this understanding, when the "conservatives" attacked Comrade Mu Guoxing, we took resolute protective measures.

Chairman Mao said: "Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." In our joint struggles, we established a deep revolutionary friendship with Comrade Mu Guoxing. At the critical moment of seizing power from the handful of capitalists within the Party, he helped us formulate battle plans. After seizing power, he helped us determine measures for holding power, becoming a leading force in seizing and holding power. He played a significant role in our correct implementation of Party policies and in uniting a broad range of cadres, especially mid-level and above cadres.

Distinguish Between Two Types of Contradictions

Some cadres in our institute have committed serious errors. A deputy head of the Organization Department of the original Party Committee, in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line, labeling a large number of revolutionary teachers and students as "counter-revolutionaries." Should such cadres be abandoned or saved? Chairman Mao said: "For those party members and cadres who have made mistakes but can still be educated, and who differ from those who are beyond redemption, no matter what their origin, they should all be educated, not abandoned by us." "We must not only look at a cadre's one-time or one-event performance but also at the cadre's entire history and entire work." Through studying Chairman Mao's works and conducting investigations, we made a comprehensive analysis of this deputy head's problems, concluding that although his errors were serious, from his overall performance, he was not anti-Party or anti-socialist. His contradictions with the Party and the people were still internal contradictions among the people. Therefore, we must unswervingly implement the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." Thus, we distinguished the exposure and criticism of his errors from the fierce struggle against the handful of capitalists within the Party.

Chairman Mao said: "Past mistakes must be exposed, without any mercy." We held multiple large and small meetings to expose and criticize this deputy head's errors, helping him analyze the causes, environment, and methods of correcting his errors, encouraging him to come forward and expose problems, and giving him the opportunity to redeem himself through meritorious service. Thus, with the help of revolutionary masses, he exposed a large number of crimes committed by the handful of capitalists within the Party, educating both the masses and himself.

To help him build confidence and determination to correct his errors, we had dozens of individual talks with him. We discussed the situation, pointed out the direction, sounded the alarm, and encouraged him for every small progress, helping him withstand attacks from conservative forces. Through a series of efforts, he gradually recognized his past errors, made a fairly profound self-criticism, and was saved by us. Whenever he talks about this, he excitedly says: "I was able to return to Chairman Mao's side completely thanks to the red guards using Mao Zedong Thought to rescue me." This had a significant impact on those cadres who had committed serious errors, strengthening their determination and courage to correct their errors.

Use Mao Zedong Thought to Mobilize Cadres' Initiative for Self-Revolution

Chairman Mao taught us: "Dialectical materialism holds that external causes are the conditions of change, and internal causes are the basis of change, with external causes functioning through internal causes." Some cadres made errors of varying degrees in their past work, especially in executing the bourgeois reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If the masses are not mobilized to criticize them, their errors cannot be corrected, and they cannot meet the conditions for uniting with the masses. Criticizing cadres' errors is to help them stand up, which is an important prerequisite for uniting with cadres. However, if cadres who have made errors lack the strong desire and determination to transform themselves, such criticism is ineffective. Therefore, while criticizing, we must strive to mobilize their initiative for self-revolution.

In the process of educating cadres who have made errors, we paid special attention to arming them with Mao Zedong Thought and inspiring their self-awareness of revolution. A deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Biology Department, from the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, protected the handful of capitalists within the Party, compiled black materials, and attacked the revolutionary faction. Later, he formed an alliance with several other cadres to transfer black materials, attempting to "settle accounts in the autumn." When the masses struggled against him, his attitude was obstinate, and a stalemate occurred. At this time, some in our faction believed that "without a fierce struggle, there will be no results," but the majority disagreed, believing that "for ideological and political problems, we must not adopt a rash attitude." The Red Rebels criticized the former incorrect view and, targeting his fear of the masses, had over a hundred individual talks with him, studying together the parts of "The Little Red Book" on "Communist Party Members" and "Criticism and Self-Criticism," helping him draw strength from Chairman Mao's works to transform himself. When he fell ill, those he had labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" still visited him. These actions deeply moved him, and he made a firm decision to correct his errors, exposing the transfer of black materials and making a fairly good self-criticism.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we adopted various forms of education for cadres who had made errors. For example, we held three-level cadre study meetings, meetings to expose the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, and soul-searching meetings. Especially in September of last year, we held a three-level meeting for institute, department, and section cadres, targeting the fear of mass movements among many cadres at the time, organizing cadres to study Chairman Mao's works, explain policies, reveal thoughts, and expose problems. To inspire cadres to self-revolution, in terms of policy, we proposed five "no past blame": for those who had sealed doors and spoken absolutely in the past, as long as they sincerely confess and expose, there will be no past blame; for those who had formed alliances, as long as they honestly confess now and stop activities, there will be no past blame; for those who had destroyed black materials, but now admit errors, there will be no past blame; for those who had avoided the movement in the past, but now return and admit errors, actively participate in the movement, there will be no past blame; for those who had slandered and spread rumors behind the scenes, opposed revolutionary masses, but now voluntarily confess and mend their ways, there will be no past blame. This played a positive role in encouraging cadres to drop their burdens, dispel doubts, and stand up for revolution at that time.

Practice has once again proven that we must arm cadres with Mao Zedong Thought and combine criticism and struggle with educating cadres to self-revolution. This way, cadres who have made errors will be convinced, and more cadres will stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Let Cadres Experience the Storms of Mass Struggles

Chairman Mao taught us: "Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of mass struggles, and this world is the great world of mass struggles."

One of the reasons cadres make errors is that they have long been detached from the masses, fear the masses, and fear mass movements. To make them recognize and correct their errors, we must, while conducting ideological criticism, let them experience the storms of mass struggles. When we criticized the errors of the work team, the responsible comrades had no understanding of their errors and were particularly afraid of the masses. Based on this situation, we first let him go to the masses to listen to opinions. Initially, he went to meet with students with a fearful heart, but after visiting seven departments (out of the institute's eight departments) and holding discussions with several classes of students, listening to the masses' criticisms, his fear disappeared. At this point, he deeply realized: "The masses are the true heroes, while we are often naive and laughable." With the help of the masses, he had a fairly profound understanding of his errors, determined to correct his errors, and return to the side of Chairman Mao's line, quickly gaining the masses' forgiveness.

As the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line deepened and the bourgeois reactionary line was thoroughly defeated, a large number of cadres began to come forward. We took a group of cadres who had transformed relatively well to the factories and rural areas to experience the storms of mass struggles. Before going down, the deputy head of the Chemistry Department, Xu Guolin, had a shallow understanding of his errors. Later, as the Red Guards went down to connect with the revolution, they were attacked and detained by conservative forces. In the struggle, he saw the Red Guards firmly studying "The Little Red Book" in extremely difficult conditions and their great revolutionary spirit, which deeply educated him, changing his thoughts and feelings.

"Go to the masses, stay with the masses." This is Chairman Mao's great teaching. We red rebels must let cadres who have made line errors go to the masses and experience the storms of mass struggles to be tested and educated. This way, cadres who have made errors will gradually replace "self" with "public," replace "fear" with "dare," and replace "believing in oneself" with "believing in the masses," firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Grasp the Active Thoughts Within the Revolutionary Faction and Carry Out Ideological Struggles

Chairman Mao said: "We advocate active ideological struggles because they are weapons to achieve unity within the Party and revolutionary organizations for the sake of battle." We red rebels timely grasp the active thoughts within the faction regarding cadre issues and actively carry out ideological struggles, which have played a significant role in correctly implementing Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and uniting the majority of cadres.

After the mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line deepened, some held on to cadres who had made general line errors. We discovered this problem and realized that this approach of excessively pursuing individual responsibility was against Chairman Mao's teaching of "clearing up thoughts and uniting comrades" and was not beneficial to the current struggle.

After research, we conducted propaganda and education within the faction and organized the study of Chairman Mao's relevant works and relevant editorials and articles from the "Red Flag" magazine, criticizing the aforementioned erroneous thoughts and actions. Within the faction, we emphasized that the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line must focus on politics, grasping major principles and not minor issues. For cadres who had made general errors but had already corrected them, we should quickly "liberate" them. For those whose corrections were not yet obvious, we should give them time to correct their errors; in the process of correcting errors, we should allow for small fluctuations and even small reversals.

Later, as the movement continued to develop and the faction expanded, some comrades within the faction developed arrogance, self-satisfaction, individualism, and sectarian tendencies, and anarchist thoughts began to emerge within the faction. Aiming at these problems, we organized the fighters within the faction to study "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas within the Party" and, centering on cadre issues, carried out a full-faction debate. This was a major propaganda and study of Chairman Mao's policies on cadres. Through the debate, we initially criticized the thoughts of doubting everything, rejecting everything, and overthrowing everything, fiercely fought against "self," and Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's policies on cadres penetrated deeper into people's hearts, laying a good ideological foundation for us to further unite the majority of cadres. We are fully confident that through the movement, we will ultimately unite more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses, ensuring our invincibility.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party." Only by resolutely following the Party's policies advocated by Chairman Mao and correctly handling cadres can we establish a revolutionary "three-in-one combination," form the core of the power seizure struggle, smoothly achieve victory in the power seizure struggle, and truly seize power.

    坚决执行毛主席的干部政策　争取和团结大多数干部
    哈尔滨工农兵大学　毛泽东思想红卫兵红色造反团
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，有不少干部，由于资产阶级世界观没有改造或者没有改造好，“怕”字当头，“私”字作怪，自觉或不自觉地执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了不同程度的错误。对犯错误的干部，我们坚决执行了毛主席的干部政策，同违背毛泽东思想的错误做法进行坚决斗争，争取和团结大多数干部。
    “敢”字当头，坚决同革命领导干部结合
    革命的领导干部是党的宝贵财富，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的骨干。敢不敢坚决依靠革命的领导干部，是无产阶级革命派能否取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权胜利的关键。在这个问题上，我们学校存在着两种思想的尖锐斗争：一种是怀疑一切，排斥一切；一种是充分信任，坚决依靠。在对待原党委委员、宣传部副部长穆国兴同志的问题上，集中反映了这两种思想的斗争。
    运动一开始，穆国兴同志就领导革命师生揭发院党委的问题，被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打成了“反革命”。“十六条”公布之后，革命师生冲破白色恐怖，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派英勇反击时，他坚决站在革命派一边，和革命师生共同战斗，并积极向受蒙蔽的干部和群众做思想工作。我们认为，穆国兴同志过去虽然有一些缺点和错误，但在阶级斗争的关键时刻，始终站在毛主席革命路线一边，是我们红色造反者坚决依靠的力量。受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派指使的八八团，却对敢于和红色造反团一起战斗的革命干部，恨之入骨。他们给穆国兴同志扣上了“政治扒手”“挑动群众斗群众”等罪名，以揪造反团的“后台”为名，对他进行多次围攻和斗争，妄图打击革命干部，整垮红色造反团，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。红色造反团内一小部分同志，在这种反动思潮的影响下，怕当“保”字派，也不敢依靠穆国兴同志。我们经过学习毛主席著作，认识到对经过阶级斗争考验的无产阶级当权派不敢信任，不敢支持，不敢依靠，就是形“左”实右的一种表现。无产阶级革命派的革命性，不仅表现在敢于和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行坚决的斗争，而且也表现在敢于同坚持毛主席革命路线的革命干部相结合。基于这种认识，当“保”字派对穆国兴同志进行围攻时，我们采取了坚决保护的措施。
    毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”在共同的战斗中，我们和穆国兴同志建立了深厚的革命友谊。在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，他和我们一起制订作战计划。夺权之后，他又和我们一起确定掌权措施，成为夺权和掌权的领导力量。他对我们正确执行党的政策，争取团结广大干部，尤其是争取和团结中层以上的干部，起了很大作用。
    要区分两类不同性质的矛盾
    我院有一部分干部的错误性质很严重。原党委组织部一位副部长在文化革命运动初期，忠实地执行了资产阶级反动路线，把大批革命师生打成“反革命”。对这样的干部是抛弃，还是挽救呢？毛主席说：“对于那些犯了错误但是还可以教育的、同那些不可救药的分子有区别的党员和干部，不论其出身如何，都应当加以教育，而不是抛弃他们。”“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”。通过学习毛主席著作和调查研究，我们对这位副部长的问题作了比较全面的分析，认为他的错误是严重的，但从一贯表现来看，还不是反党反社会主义的，他同党和人民的矛盾还是属于人民内部矛盾，因此决不能采取对待敌人的办法，一脚踢开，把他赶到敌人方面去，必须毫不动摇地实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策。因此，我们把揭发批判他的错误与狠斗走资本主义道路的当权派区别开来。
    毛主席说：“对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面”。我们召开了多次大小会议，揭发批判这位副部长的错误，帮助他分析犯错误的原因、环境和改正错误的办法，让他站出来揭发问题，给予立功补过的机会。于是，他在革命群众的帮助下，先后揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大量的罪行，教育了群众，也教育了他自己。
    为了帮助他树立改正错误的信心和决心，我们先后与他进行个别谈话有几十次。给他讲形势，指方向，敲警钟，对他的每一点微小的进步，及时给予鼓励，帮助他顶住来自保守势力方面的攻击。通过一系列的工作，他逐渐地认识了过去的错误，作了比较深刻的检查，被我们挽救过来了。每当他谈起这件事，就激动地说：“我能够重新回到毛主席身边来，完全是红卫兵小将用毛泽东思想抢救的结果。”这对那些犯严重错误的干部震动很大，增强了他们改正错误的决心和前进的勇气。
    用毛泽东思想调动干部自我革命积极性
    毛主席教导我们：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”有些干部在过去的工作中，犯有不同程度的错误，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中，犯了执行资产阶级反动路线的错误，如果不发动群众对他们进行批判，他们的错误就不能得到纠正，也就不能取得与群众相结合的条件。批判干部的错误是为了使他们站立起来，这是团结干部的一个重要前提。但是，如果犯错误的干部没有改造自己的强烈愿望和决心，这种批判也是不起作用的。因此，必须在批判的同时，努力调动他们自我革命的积极性。
    我们在对犯错误干部进行教育的过程中，特别注意用毛泽东思想武装他们，启发他们自觉革命。生物系党总支一位副书记，自文化大革命开始就保党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，整理黑材料，打击革命派。后来他又与几个干部订立攻守同盟，转移黑材料，妄图“秋后算帐”。当群众对他进行斗争的时候，态度很顽固，一度出现了僵持的局面。这时，我们团内有的人认为“不狠斗不出货”，但多数人不同意这种看法，认为“对待思想上的毛病和政治上的毛病，决不能采用鲁莽的态度”。红色造反者批判了前一种不正确意见，针对他害怕群众的思想，同他进行了一百多次个别谈话，和他一起学习《毛主席语录》中“共产党员”和“批评与自我批评”等部分，使他从毛主席著作中吸取改造自己的力量。他有了病，被他打成“反革命”的同志还去看望他。这些都使他深受感动，下定了改正错误的决心，揭发了转移黑材料等问题，也做了比较好的检查。
    我们遵照毛主席的教导，对犯错误的干部采取了多种教育形式。如开三级干部学习会议，开控诉资产阶级反动路线罪恶会，开触灵魂会。特别是去年九月召开的院、处、科三级干部会，针对当时许多干部怕群众运动的思想，组织干部学习毛主席著作，交代政策，亮思想，揭发问题。为了启发干部自觉革命，在政策方面我们提出了五个“过往不咎”：过去把门封死了，话说绝了，只要认真交代、揭发，过往不咎；已经订立攻守同盟的，只要现在老实交代，停止活动，过往不咎；销毁黑材料的，但现在承认错误，过往不咎；过去逃避运动，但现在回来，承认错误，积极参加运动，过往不咎；背后捣乱，造谣生事，刮阴风，放暗箭，反对革命群众，但只要现在主动交代，痛改前非，过往不咎。这在当时对发动干部丢掉包袱，解除顾虑，站出来革命，起了积极作用。
    实践再一次证明，必须用毛泽东思想武装干部，把批判斗争与教育干部自觉革命结合起来。这样做的结果，使犯错误的干部心悦诚服，使更多的干部站到毛主席的革命路线一边来。
    让干部到群众斗争的风雨中去经受锻炼
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”
    干部犯错误的原因之一，就是他们长期脱离群众，害怕群众，害怕群众运动的暴风雨。要使他们认识错误和改正错误，必须在进行思想批判的同时，让他们到群众斗争中去。当我们批判工作队的错误时，工作队的负责同志，对错误没有认识，对群众特别害怕。根据这种情况，我们首先让他到群众中去听取意见。开始他带着恐惧的心理去接触同学，但当他走访了七个系（全院八个系），与几个班级的同学开了座谈会，听取了群众的批评以后，他的恐惧心理打消了。这时他才深刻地认识到：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。在群众的帮助下，他对自己犯的错误有了比较深刻的认识，决心改正错误，回到毛主席路线一边来，很快取得了群众的谅解。
    随着对资产阶级反动路线的深入批判和资产阶级反动路线的全面破产，广大干部开始亮相。我们将一部分转变较好的干部带到工厂、农村群众斗争的大风雨中去。我院化学系副主任徐国林在下去以前，对自己的错误认识不深刻。后来随着红卫兵小将下去进行革命串连，遭到保守势力的围攻、拘留。在斗争中他看到红卫兵小将在极端困难的情况下坚持学习毛主席语录，看到他们的大无畏的革命精神，使他受到很大教育，思想感情发生了变化。
    “到群众里面去，和群众在一起”。这是毛主席的伟大教导，我们红色造反者一定要让犯了路线错误的干部到群众中去，到群众斗争的暴风雨中去接受考验，接受教育。这样，就会使犯错误的干部逐渐把“私”字换成“公”字，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“相信自己”换成“相信群众”，才能坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边。
    抓住革命队伍内部的活思想开展思想斗争
    毛主席说：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。”我们红色造反者及时抓住团内对待干部问题的活思想，积极开展思想斗争，对正确贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，争取团结干部大多数起了很大作用。
    在群众性的批判资产阶级反动路线深入开展以后，有的对一般犯路线错误的干部揪住不放。我们发现了这个问题，认识到这种过分追究个人责任的做法，是违背毛主席关于“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的教导的，是对当前的斗争不利的。
    经过研究，我们在团内进行宣传教育，并组织学习毛主席有关的著作和《红旗》杂志有关社论、文章，批判了上述种种错误思想和作法。在团内强调了批判资产阶级反动路线必须突出政治，要抓大是大非问题，不搞小是小非问题。对于犯一般错误而已经有了改正的干部，要尽快“解放”出来。对于那些改正还不明显的人，要给以改正错误的时间；在改正错误的过程中，要允许有小的动摇甚至小的反复。
    后来，随着运动的不断发展，队伍不断扩大，团内一部分同志产生了骄傲自满情绪和个人主义、风头主义等错误倾向，无政府主义思潮开始在团内反映出来。针对这些问题，我们又组织团内战士学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，并围绕干部问题，开展了一次全团大辩论。这是一次对毛主席干部政策的大宣传、大学习。通过辩论，初步批判了怀疑一切、排斥一切、打倒一切的思想，狠斗了“私”字，毛泽东思想、毛主席的干部政策更加深入人心，为我们进一步争取团结大多数干部打下了良好的思想基础。我们完全有信心，经过运动，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众，使自己立于不败之地。
    毛主席教导我们：“政策和策略是党的生命”。只有坚决按着毛主席一贯提倡的党的政策，正确地对待干部，才能建立革命的“三结合”，形成夺权斗争的领导核心，顺利地取得夺权斗争的胜利，真正把权掌起来。
