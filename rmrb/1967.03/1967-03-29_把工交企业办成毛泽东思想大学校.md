The Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province and the Provincial Military Region held a conference on the industrial and transportation front to promote revolution and production.

The conference called on all revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across the province to further boost their enthusiasm, strive to excel, and complete and overfulfill the national production and construction plans. Currently, special emphasis should be placed on coal, timber production, and transportation; product quality must be ensured, and high-quality products should be striven for.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 28 - From March 20 to 25, the Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province and the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region jointly held the first large-scale conference on the industrial and transportation front to promote revolution and production since the victory of the seizure of power in Heilongjiang Province.

This conference was held after the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in Factories and Mines Across the Country," when the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of revolutionary workers was extremely high, and both the revolution and production were booming. Representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army and militia from various industrial and transportation fronts across the province attended the conference. They seriously studied and discussed the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in Factories and Mines Across the Country" and unanimously agreed that this is a new call to arms issued by the great leader Chairman Mao to us, and a signal to advance and seize victory in both revolution and production. The representatives expressed their determination to implement the latest instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest effort, the fastest speed, and the most serious attitude, and to quickly launch a new upsurge of "promoting revolution and production" on the industrial and transportation front.

At the conference, Comrade Pan Fusheng, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province, delivered a report. Comrade Zhang Wanchun, Deputy Commander of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, and Comrade Guo Qiang, the Third Political Commissar, spoke. Representatives from the Harbin Boiler Factory, Beiman Steel Plant, and Harbin Railway Bureau introduced their experiences in promoting revolution and production.

The conference pointed out: Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the proletarian cultural revolution in Heilongjiang Province has entered a new stage. The proletarian revolutionary forces have united, welcomed the new dawn of Northeast China, implemented the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and launched a magnificent struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road across the province. The Party, government, financial, and cultural powers usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road on the industrial and transportation front have been and are being seized. This excellent revolutionary situation has strongly promoted the development of industrial production. The total industrial output value of the province in January and February this year has increased compared to the same period last year, and the production level is rising month by month. Among the 50 main industrial products, 27 have increased in February compared to January. Among them, the production increase of machine-drawn farm tools, industrial pumps, plastic products, synthetic fibers, bicycles, paper, soap, and other products is relatively large. Many products supporting agriculture have seen more significant increases. Product quality and labor productivity have improved, varieties have increased, and costs have been reduced. A large number of facts have proven that once the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought seizes power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the immeasurable socialist enthusiasm and boundless wisdom hidden among the masses will erupt like a volcano, creating miracles that shake the heavens and earth.

The conference called on the revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across Heilongjiang Province to further boost their enthusiasm, strive to excel, and complete and overfulfill the national production and construction plans. Currently, special emphasis should be placed on coal, timber production, and transportation; product quality must be ensured, and high-quality products should be striven for. All industrial and transportation enterprises should regard supporting agriculture as an important political task. Extensively launch a production and savings movement centered on saving coal, wood, and electricity, vigorously reduce the consumption of raw materials, cherish state resources, and tap production potential from all aspects. Strictly implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "save and make revolution," and oppose extravagance, showiness, and wastefulness.

The conference emphasized: The current situation of the proletarian cultural revolution on the industrial and transportation front in Heilongjiang Province is good. To achieve a thorough victory in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the proletarian revolutionary forces must implement large-scale unity by unit and system, and implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." All revolutionary mass organizations must seriously carry out the rectification movement, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, correct various erroneous tendencies, and unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. They should follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and cadre policy to correctly handle cadres. For cadres who have made mistakes, the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the patient" should be adopted, giving cadres who have made mistakes the opportunity to reflect on and correct their mistakes, and encouraging them to make amends. Revolutionary leading cadres should be absorbed into the temporary power organs of the "three-in-one combination," and revolutionary leading cadres should play a core and backbone role in this organ. However, under no circumstances should the "three-in-one combination" be used to advocate conciliationism, eclecticism, or to merge into one, or even to bring the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road into the temporary power organs of the "three-in-one combination."

The conference also made arrangements for strengthening leadership and establishing command organs on the production front.

The conference pointed out that to achieve victory in both revolution and production, the key to the key, the fundamental to the fundamental, is to arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. We should, according to the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, adapt to the new situation of the proletarian cultural revolution and bring the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We should study to a new level, apply to a new level, create a new situation, and launch a new upsurge. Currently, we should, in conjunction with the practical struggle of the two classes, two roads, and two lines, study and apply well the "Old Three Articles" and the brilliant works "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Opposing Liberalism," and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," to carry out a revolution in the depths of the soul, eliminate private interests and establish public interests, seize the power of the "self" in the mind, and establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people. Truly imprint Mao Zedong Thought in the mind, dissolve it in the blood, and implement it in action, turning industrial and transportation enterprises into schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives at the conference unanimously pointed out: The great People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and an important guarantee for promoting revolution and production. All revolutionary mass organizations should enthusiastically support the participation of the representatives of the People's Liberation Army in the temporary power organs of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The People's Liberation Army, with great efforts, assists the local areas and supports industrial production work, which will undoubtedly have a great promoting effect on the promotion of revolution and production on the industrial and transportation front. The revolutionary workers and cadres on the industrial and transportation front should closely cooperate with the comrades of the People's Liberation Army and complete and overfulfill various production and construction tasks even more excellently.

The conference concluded with the shout of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" and thunderous applause, and passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

    黑龙江省革命委员会和省军区召开工交战线抓革命、促生产工作会议
    把工交企业办成毛泽东思想大学校
    号召全省厂矿企业革命职工和革命干部进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，完成和超额完成国家生产和建设计划。当前，特别要狠抓煤炭、木材生产和交通运输工作；要保证产品质量，力争产品高质量
    新华社哈尔滨二十八日电　黑龙江省革命委员会和黑龙江省军区，在三月二十日到二十五日，联合召开了黑龙江省夺权胜利后第一次规模盛大的工业交通战线抓革命、促生产工作会议。
    这次会议是在《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》公布以后，广大革命职工的革命热情极为高涨，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾的新形势下召开的。会上，来自全省各地工业交通战线的革命群众组织代表、革命干部代表、人民解放军和民兵代表，认真地学习和讨论了《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，一致认为这是伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出的新的动员令，是夺取革命、生产双胜利的进军号。代表们表示，一定要以最高的热情，最大的干劲，最快的速度，最认真的精神，把毛主席和党中央的最新指示，贯彻到实际工作中去，在工交战线上迅速掀起一个“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。
    会上，黑龙江省革命委员会主任委员潘复生同志作了报告，黑龙江省军区副司令员张万春同志和第三政治委员郭强同志讲了话。哈尔滨锅炉厂、北满钢厂、哈尔滨铁路局等单位的无产阶级革命派代表，介绍了他们抓革命、促生产的经验。
    会议指出：黑龙江省无产阶级文化大革命，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，已经发展到了一个新的阶段。无产阶级革命派联合起来，迎着东北的新曙光，实行革命的“三结合”，在全省展开了波澜壮阔的向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争。工交战线上被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所窃踞的党、政、财、文大权，已经和正在被夺取过来。这一大好的革命形势，强有力地推动了工业生产的发展。今年一、二月份全省工业总产值比去年同期都有增长，而且生产水平逐月上升。在五十种主要工业产品中，二月份产量比一月份增加的有二十七种。其中，机引农具、工业泵、塑料制品、人造纤维、自行车、纸张、肥皂等，增产幅度都比较大。许多支援农业的产品增产更为突出。产品质量和劳动生产率都有所提高，品种有所增加，成本有所降低。大量的事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，一旦从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权，掌了权，蕴藏在群众中无可估量的社会主义积极性和无穷智慧，就会象火山爆发那样迸发出来，创造出惊天动地的奇迹。
    会议号召黑龙江省厂矿企业广大革命职工、革命干部进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，完成和超额完成国家生产计划和国家建设计划。当前，特别要狠抓煤炭、木材生产和交通运输工作；要保证产品质量，力争产品高质量。一切工业交通企业，都要把支援农业作为一项重要的政治任务。广泛开展以节约煤、木、电为中心的增产节约运动，大力降低原材料的消耗，爱护国家资材，从各方面挖掘生产潜力。要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，反对讲排场、摆阔气、铺张浪费。　　　　　　　　　　　
    会议着重指出：当前，黑龙江省工业交通战线无产阶级文化大革命的形势很好，为了取得向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的彻底胜利，无产阶级革命派必须实行按单位、按系统的大联合，实行革命的“三结合”。各个革命群众组织必须认真开展整风运动，活学活用毛主席著作，纠正各种错误思想倾向，在毛泽东思想基础上统一起来。要按照毛主席的革命路线，按照毛主席的干部政策，正确地对待干部。对犯错误的干部，必须采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，给犯错误的干部以检讨错误、改正错误的机会，鼓励他们将功补过。对于革命的领导干部要吸收他们参加“三结合”的临时权力机构，革命的领导干部应该在这个机构中起核心作用和骨干作用。但是，绝不准借口“三结合”搞折衷主义，调和主义，合二而一，甚至把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派拉进“三结合”的临时权力机构中来。
    会议对加强领导、建立生产第一线的指挥机构问题也做了安排。
    会议指出，要夺取革命、生产双胜利，关键的关键，根本的根本，是用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。我们要按照林彪同志的指示，适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段。要学出新水平，用出新水平，要出现新的局面，掀起新的高潮。当前要结合两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争实践，学好用好“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作，在灵魂深处闹革命，灭资兴无，破私立公，夺头脑里“私”字的权，树立一心为革命，一心为人民的思想，真正把毛泽东思想印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，把工交企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    与会代表一致指出：伟大的人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，是搞好抓革命、促生产的重要保证。一切革命的群众组织都要热烈拥护解放军的代表参加革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。人民解放军大力协助地方，支持工业生产工作，必将对工交战线的抓革命、促生产起巨大推动作用。工交战线广大革命职工和革命干部，要同人民解放军的同志密切合作，更加出色地完成和超额完成各项生产建设任务。
    会议最后在“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声和暴风雨般的掌声中，通过了给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
