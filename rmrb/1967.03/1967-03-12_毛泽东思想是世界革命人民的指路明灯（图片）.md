Mao Zedong Thought Is the Beacon for the World's Revolutionary People (Photo)

Mao Zedong Thought is universally applicable

It is applicable to all revolutionary people around the world.

Robert F. Williams (third from the left): Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for the struggle of the world's revolutionary people. Chairman Mao's theories are universally applicable and are suitable for all revolutionary people around the world. All revolutionary people around the world must study Mao Zedong Thought, learn it from a revolutionary standpoint, and apply it to the people's revolutionary struggle to achieve victory. I will study Chairman Mao's works diligently and do everything I can to spread Mao Zedong Thought among the American people.

China is a great base for world revolution. Anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese people is an enemy of the people of the world. To defend the base of world revolution, we must fight against the enemies of the world's revolutionary people. We revolutionaries living in China must, on the one hand, care about the struggles of the Chinese people, and on the other hand, never forget the oppressed and exploited people of our own country. We should study Chairman Mao's works diligently.

Mrs. Robert F. Williams (second from the left): I deeply feel that I must study Chairman Mao's works diligently to revolutionize my thinking and better serve the American people and the people of the world.

I particularly love studying Chairman Mao's "Three Articles," which I have studied many times and am still studying. The more I study, the more I love it. When I am not strong enough, studying Chairman Mao's works makes me strong again.

We often study Chairman Mao's works together as a family, arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and contributing to the liberation of American blacks and the world revolution.

I have confidence in the victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution because Chairman Mao has unlimited trust in the masses, and I have unlimited trust in Chairman Mao.

Remember Chairman Mao's Teachings

Struggle for National Liberation

Amus M. Sumane, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee (left):

Chairman Mao Zedong's works are universal truths and the strongest weapons for all oppressed nations and peoples. Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out that only through self-reliance can the oppressed and enslaved nations and peoples of the world achieve true liberation. I believe that, relying on the broad masses of Mozambique, mobilizing the people to support the national liberation war, we can carry the liberation war to the end until Mozambique is completely freed from imperialism.

We must definitely follow the Chinese path. We must definitely bring back Mao Zedong Thought and the support of 700 million Chinese people. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

Yulius Zonzi, National Propaganda Secretary of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee (right): Because of Chairman Mao's leadership, there is today's new China and new society. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, such a miraculous achievement would not have been possible. All this inspires us to fight even more bravely for our liberation.

Mao Zedong Thought Is the Most Powerful Weapon to Defeat the Enemy

For the Liberation of the People of South West Africa, I Will Study Mao Zedong Thought Diligently

Albert Tizi, South West Africa National Union: Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for all revolutionary forces and the most powerful weapon for all revolutionary forces to defeat the enemy. Imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys are heading towards the grave. I am determined to study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, to make my own contribution to the complete burial of imperialism and its lackeys, and to fulfill the mission entrusted to us by the people of South West Africa.

Revolution Must Follow the Path Indicated by Mao Zedong

Mao Zedong Thought Dispelled the Confusion in My Mind

Ron Tong, Indonesia: Revolutionary people around the world and the oppressed people who are rising up to resist oppression cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the truth and the most powerful weapon of struggle. No matter how hard the U.S. imperialists, modern revisionists, and their lackeys try, they cannot extinguish Mao Zedong Thought.

In the past, my understanding of imperialism, modern revisionism, and their lackeys was very vague. I was worried about the future of my country and people. I gradually became disheartened and lost on the revolutionary path. After studying Mao Zedong Thought, I felt my mind became clearer and more awake, and my spirit became more vigorous. I now understand the true nature of imperialism, modern revisionism, and their lackeys. Now I realize that my previous despair and confusion were reflections of bourgeois ideology in my mind.

All revolutionary people around the world, especially the Indonesian people who are fighting against the fascist rule of Suharto-Nasution, declare to the world: Revolution must follow the path indicated by Mao Zedong. To deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought means the failure of the revolution, means betraying the revolution.

With the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought

The Chinese People Have Created Miracles

Patience Esme Werapha Madoro, Zimbabwe: Imperialism and modern revisionism want to strangle the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," have achieved successes beyond the expectations of imperialism and modern revisionism. This is because the Chinese people have Chairman Mao's leadership and because the Chinese people follow the correct path of self-reliance. As Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes." I believe the Chinese people will continue to advance bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的指路明灯（图片）
    毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的
    是适用于全世界一切革命人民的
    美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉（左三）：毛泽东思想是世界革命人民斗争的指导方针，毛主席的理论是放之四海而皆准的，是适用于全世界一切革命人民的。全世界革命人民都要学习毛泽东思想，要用革命的观点来学习，并且运用到人民革命斗争中去，使革命人民的斗争得到胜利。我要好好学习毛主席著作，并且尽一切力量向美国人民传播毛泽东思想。
    中国是世界革命的一个伟大根据地。凡是反对毛泽东思想、反对中国人民的，都是全世界人民的敌人。我们为了维护世界革命的基地，必须同世界革命人民的敌人展开斗争。我们住在中国的革命者，一方面要关心中国国内人民的斗争，一方面千万不要忘记被压迫被剥削的本国人民。我们应该好好学习毛主席著作。
    罗伯特·威廉夫人（左二）：我深深感到，一定要好好学习毛主席著作，使自己思想革命化，更好地为美国人民和世界人民服务。
    我特别爱学毛主席的“老三篇”，学了好多遍，现在还在学，越学越爱学。当我不够坚强的时候，学了毛主席著作就坚强起来了。
    我们经常全家一起学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，为美国黑人的解放和世界革命作出贡献。
    我对中国文化大革命的胜利有信心，因为毛主席无限信任群众，而我则无限信任毛主席。
    图为罗伯特·威廉一家在学习毛主席著作。
    牢牢记住毛主席的教导
    为民族解放而奋斗
    莫三鼻给革命委员会中央委员会副主席阿穆斯·毛里西乌·苏马尼（图左）：
    毛泽东主席的著作是普遍的真理，是一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的最强大的武器。毛泽东主席指出，只有依靠自力更生，世界上被压迫、受奴役的民族才能获得真正的解放。我相信，依靠莫三鼻给的广大群众，动员人民起来支持民族解放战争，我们就能够把解放战争进行到底，直到莫三鼻给完全摆脱帝国主义。
    我们一定要走中国的道路。我们一定把毛泽东思想和七亿中国人民的支持带回去。我们要牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    莫三鼻给革命委员会全国宣传书记尤利乌斯·宗齐（图右）：由于毛主席领导，才有了今天这样的新中国、新社会，如果没有中国共产党和毛主席领导，就不可能出现这样惊人的奇迹。这一切鼓舞了我们，更要为我们的解放而英勇斗争。
    毛泽东思想是打败敌人的最有力的武器
    为了西南非人民的解放，我要好好学习毛泽东思想
    西南非民族联盟　艾伯特·齐祖：毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马列主义。毛泽东思想是一切革命力量的指南，是一切革命力量打败敌人的最有力的武器。以美国为首的帝国主义和它们的走狗正在走向坟墓。我决心努力学习毛泽东思想，为彻底埋葬帝国主义和它们的走狗作出自己应有的贡献，完成西南非人民所赋予我们的使命。
    革命必须走毛泽东指出的道路
    毛泽东思想驱散了我心里的迷雾
    印尼　罗恩唐：全世界革命人民和正在起来反抗压迫的被压迫人民，都不能离开毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是真理，是最有力的斗争武器。美帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗，不管用任何力量都扼杀不了毛泽东思想。
    过去，我对帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗认识很模糊。对祖国和人民的前途感到忧虑。自己在革命道路上也逐渐失望和徬徨起来。当我学习了毛泽东思想以后，我感到我的思想更加开朗和清醒，精神也振作起来了。我对帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗的面目有了认识，看清了它们的本质。现在我认识到，我原来那种失望、徬徨是头脑里资产阶级思想的反映。
    全世界的革命人民，特别是正在进行反苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯统治斗争的印尼人民，向全世界宣告：革命必须走毛泽东指出的道路。离开毛泽东思想的道路将意味着革命的失败，意味着背叛革命。
    有了毛泽东思想的指导
    中国人民创造了奇迹
    津巴布韦　佩兴斯·埃斯梅·韦拉皮·玛卓罗：帝国主义、现代修正主义想卡中国人民的脖子。但是，中国人民遵照毛主席的教导，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”终于取得了帝国主义、现代修正主义意料不到的成就。这是因为中国人民有毛主席的领导，因为中国人民走自力更生的正确道路。这正如毛主席说的：“群众是真正的英雄”。我相信中国人民将继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗奋勇前进！
