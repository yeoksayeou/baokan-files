Soldiers on the Frontline of Spring Plowing

	"Blacksmiths" Trained in One Night

The comrades from the tank repair shop of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army responded to Chairman Mao's and the Central Military Commission's call to seize the opportunity to support agricultural production with manpower and technology. They immediately organized a repair team and rushed to the frontline of spring plowing. One afternoon, they heard that the fifth production brigade had eight plowshares that were severely damaged and needed many hooks and rings to be repaired. The shop had no blacksmiths, so who could make these things? Just as everyone was at a loss, the Five Good Soldiers, Wang Yixiu and driver Wu Zhenjiao, volunteered to take on this glorious and arduous task.

After dinner, they prepared their tools and lit the fire. The two temporary "blacksmiths" began their work. One held the tongs, the other swung the hammer. At first, they were very unskilled and uncoordinated. After much effort, the first product they made was neither round nor flat, truly a bit of a mess. However, they did not give up. Chairman Mao's great teachings, "Resolutely decide to overcome difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and strive for victory," inspired Xiao Wang and Xiao Wu to overcome all difficulties. Listen! The clanging of the hammer grew more coordinated with each strike. Look! Their movements became more skilled with each swing. The products also improved with each one made.

The night deepened, their hands were blistered, and their eyes were red from fatigue, but their spirits were as strong as the fire in the furnace. What could be more urgent than Chairman Mao's battle cry! What could be more pressing than the needs of the people!

The next morning, thirty-six sets of large and small parts were all made. When they delivered these parts to the fifth production brigade, the villagers who were busy preparing for spring plowing immediately gathered around. Seeing these urgently needed parts for repairing the plows, everyone was moved and praised them. Li Qingcai, a 63-year-old poor peasant, said excitedly, "Chairman Mao's heart is connected with ours. The People's Liberation Army is our confidant. Even though I am old, I will follow Chairman Mao's words and not be vague. In this year's spring plowing production, I will also strive to be a shock worker."

	Urgent Needs of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

The comrades from a certain unit's repair shop urgently attended to the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants and thought about what the poor and lower-middle peasants were thinking. They learned that many production brigades in their garrison area had damaged farming tools with no one to repair them, and the spring plowing season was very tight. They specially selected Chen Dongfa and two other comrades to form a mobile repair team, carrying their repair tools to the twelve production brigades in Dongjiao Commune and over a hundred production brigades to repair farming tools and electric machinery. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's call to "be frugal and make a revolution," saving as much as possible for the poor and lower-middle peasants. For things they did not understand, they went to the nearby automobile parts factory to learn from revolutionary old workers, saving a large amount of production funds for the villagers. One electric motor, after they repaired it, saved over forty yuan and more than half a month of time.

While on their repair rounds, they also actively propagated Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production" and the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, working together with the villagers in the fields. The poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously reflected, "The People's Liberation Army responds to Chairman Mao's call most resolutely and actively, thinking and doing what is in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

	"White-Seeking Doctors"

Livestock is half the wealth of a production brigade. During the process of helping with production, the horse management section of a certain unit made treating animal diseases their main task.

One day, several old poor peasants drove a horse with "middle colic" to the temporary medical clinic. Only Doctor Yang Han was at home, and he was suffering from a severe cold. But he did not hesitate to take off his shirt, roll up his sleeves, and get to work.

The horse had been sick for a long time, and its life was in danger. To ensure the horse was cured, Doctor Yang braved the sub-zero temperatures, worked through his illness to give the horse injections, pour medicine, remove the blockage, and drain the mucus, working for nearly ten hours. Finally, he cured the horse. The several old poor peasants happily led the horse back to the production brigade.

The comrades from the horse management section treated the production brigade's horses as their own with such selfless spirit. In ten days, they cured eighteen sick horses for seven communes. They were praised by the poor and lower-middle peasant villagers as "White-Seeking Doctors."

    子弟兵在春耕第一线
    一夜学成的“锻工”
    解放军某部坦克修理所的同志响应毛主席和中央军委关于不失时机地以人力和技术支援农业生产的伟大号召，马上组织了修理组奔赴春耕生产第一线。一天下午，他们听说第五生产队的八副犁杖严重损坏，需要许多钩子、环子才能修好。所里又没有锻工，这些东西谁会制作呢？正当大家束手无策的时候，五好战士向以六和驭手吴振桥自告奋勇，要求承担这一光荣而又艰巨的任务。
    吃过晚饭，备好工具升起火，两个临时“锻工”开始工作了。一个掌钳，一个抡锤。开始他们很不熟练，很不协调。费了好大的劲，做出的第一件产品圆不圆，扁不扁，真是有点四不象。但是，他们没有气馁。毛主席的伟大教导“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”鼓舞着小向和小吴去排除万难。听！叮叮当、叮叮当的打锤声，一会比一会协调。看！他们两个人的动作一会比一会熟练。产品也一个比一个好。
    夜更深了，两个人的手磨破了，眼熬红了，他俩的精力却象炉火一样旺盛。还有什么比毛主席的战斗号召更刻不容缓！还有什么比人民的需要更迫切！
    第二天清早，三十六套大小零件全部赶制出来了。当他们把这些零件赶送到第五生产队的时候，正在忙着准备春耕的社员立即围了过来，看着这些救急的修理犁杖的零件，人人感动，个个称赞。六十三岁的贫农老大爷李庆材激动地说：“毛主席和咱心连心，解放军是咱的知心人。别看我上了年纪，听毛主席的话，我可不含糊，在今年的春耕生产中，我也要争当一名突击手。”

    急贫下中农所急
    某部修械所的全体同志，急贫下中农所急，想贫下中农所想。他们了解到驻地许多生产队，农具损坏，无人修理，春耕季节又很紧迫，就专门抽调了陈栋法等三同志组成一个流动修理组，背着修理工具，到东郊公社的十二个生产大队，一百多个生产队去修理农具及电动机械。他们牢记毛主席“要节约闹革命”的号召，能节约的尽量为贫下中农节约，不懂的地方，就到附近的汽车配件厂向革命老工人请教，为社员节约了大量的生产资金。一台电动机经他们修理，就节省四十多元钱和半个多月的时间。
    在巡回修理的同时，还积极向广大贫下中农宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召和党中央的指示精神，和社员一同参加田间劳动。贫下中农纷纷反映：“解放军响应毛主席的号召最坚决、最积极，想的、干的都是俺贫下中农心窝里的事！”
                                            （催耕  宋春）
    “白求恩式的大夫”
    牲畜是生产队的半个家当，某部军马科在助民生产过程中，把治疗畜病当作自己的主要任务。
    一天，几个老贫农，驾着一匹得了“中结症”的马来到了临时医疗所。所里只有医生杨汗在家，而且还患了重感冒。但他毫不犹豫地脱掉上衣，卷起袖子，动起手来。
    马已经病得很久了，生命危在旦夕。为了保证把马治好，杨医生冒着零下十多度的严寒，带病坚持给马打针，灌药掏结，抽痰，整整忙了十几个小时。最后，终于把马病治好了。几个老贫农高高兴兴地牵着马回了生产队。
    军马科的同志就是用这样大公无私的精神，把生产队的马当成自己的马治。十几天中给七个公社治好了十八匹病马。他们被贫下中农社员称为“白求恩式的大夫”。
