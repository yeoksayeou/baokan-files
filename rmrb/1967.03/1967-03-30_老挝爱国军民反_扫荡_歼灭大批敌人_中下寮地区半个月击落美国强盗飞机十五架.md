Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: The local forces and guerrilla units of the Phongsaly Province in Laos annihilated 111 enemy troops in February during their anti-"sweeping" operations and seized 65 various weapons.

The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, mobilizing bandits, conducted continuous "sweeping" operations in many areas of Phongsaly Province, especially in the Ongdet region. These operations were thwarted by the vigilant local military and civilians, who bravely fought back and achieved victory.

The broadcast also reported that on March 3, the guerrilla units of the Xieng Khouang Province bravely intercepted the enemy forces conducting "sweeping" operations in the southern region of the Tadton District, killing and injuring many enemy troops and seizing 33 weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: The patriotic military and civilians of the Vientiane Province in Laos continued to fiercely counterattack the enemy's "sweeping" operations in February, engaging in 20 battles. They annihilated 154 enemy troops, shot down one American plane, damaged two, sank and damaged three enemy motorboats each, and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.

The report stated that the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, in order to implement their "dry season counterattack" plot, continued to dispatch large numbers of troops and bandits to launch "sweeping" operations and harassment activities in various liberated areas of the Vientiane Province in February. The military and civilians of the Vientiane Province saw through the enemy's plot, bravely intercepted the enemy, and foiled the enemy's attacks, defending the liberated areas.

The broadcast also reported that on March 2, the guerrilla units of the villages of Muan Ban and Muan Pa in the Xam Neua Province annihilated an entire bandit company during an anti-"sweeping" battle.

A liaison officer of the Lao Patriotic Front Party in the Xam Neua Province shot down an American plane with a rifle on March 7.

Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, March 28 - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: The patriotic military and civilians of the middle and lower regions of Laos shot down 15 American aggressor planes and damaged many more from January 28 to February 11 over a period of 15 days.

The radio station said that in order to salvage its disastrous situation in South Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists, during the aforementioned period, not only intensified the deployment of their ground troops to occupy the middle and lower regions of Laos but also, in collusion with their lackeys, dispatched more than 1,200 sorties of planes to bomb the ninth and twelfth national highways and the areas along the Benif River in the middle and lower regions of Laos. The local patriotic military and civilians, filled with deep hatred for the American aggressors, bravely fought back in the air battles and achieved brilliant results. (Accompanying picture)
