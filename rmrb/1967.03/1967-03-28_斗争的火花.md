The struggle of the American people against the Johnson administration's war of aggression in Vietnam is developing more widely and deeply.

A group of peace activists in Boston began a 450-mile, 45-day march from Boston to Washington on the 25th, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam. The march is scheduled to arrive in Washington on May 8, where they will hold a rally against the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam in front of the Pentagon.

On the 24th, hundreds of demonstrators held a protest outside Cornell University in New York State, opposing Secretary of State Rusk's visit to the school to promote the U.S. government's policy of aggression against Vietnam. During Rusk's speech, students in the audience frequently booed and disrupted, forcing him to pause multiple times.

Approximately 500 American doctors and other individuals held a protest in front of the White House on the 22nd, opposing the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam. They held signs condemning the use of napalm by the U.S. aggressor forces to massacre Vietnamese civilians.

Nearly 7,000 elementary and secondary school teachers and university professors from 37 states in the U.S. publicly issued a lengthy statement on the 12th, strongly condemning the Johnson administration's policy and crimes of aggression against Vietnam.

More than 1,000 people in New York City held a protest on the 11th, opposing the Johnson administration's recent new crimes of further escalating the war in Vietnam.

In early March, 450 faculty members of Michigan State University jointly issued a statement demanding that the Johnson administration immediately and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. One hundred fifty faculty members of the University of Texas also demanded in an open letter to Johnson that he immediately stop such bombing.

On the evening of the 8th, when U.S. Vice President Humphrey attended a literary conference in New York and was about to deliver a speech, a writer suddenly stood up and publicly condemned the war crimes of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam, then left the venue in protest. Nearly 100 people in the audience left with him.
