The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on March 19th condemning the Guam conference convened by Johnson to plan the escalation of the war in Vietnam. The statement sternly warns the American imperialists and their lackeys that any attempt to escalate the war will not save them from their inevitable defeat in South Vietnam.

The statement points out that the Guam conference is a meeting of American war criminals and their lackeys to discuss further intensification and expansion of their war plans in Vietnam.

The statement notes that since the beginning of this year, Johnson, after suffering unprecedented failures in his aggression against South Vietnam and his war of destruction against North Vietnam, has on one hand continued to boast about his "peaceful intentions," while on the other hand, he has relentlessly intensified and plotted to further escalate the war in Vietnam, in a vain attempt to realize his stubborn and treacherous plans of aggression.

After listing the crimes of the American aggressors in their relentless war escalation, the statement emphasizes that it is clear that all of Johnson's talk about "peace" is nothing but lies. In fact, they are intensively preparing for an extremely dangerous military adventure against the Vietnamese people. Their Guam conference is aimed at implementing their treacherous plans.

The statement says that the war plans hatched by the American imperialists in Honolulu and Manila have already suffered and are suffering humiliating defeats. Similarly, their current plots in Guam will surely meet with even more disastrous and humiliating failures.

The statement concludes by saying that no matter how barbaric the war actions of American imperialism may be, they cannot shake the iron will of the people of South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with their northern compatriots, to give the American aggressors the punishment they deserve for all their war escalations, and to carry the sacred war of resistance against America and saving the nation to a complete victory.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th, the Vietnamese newspaper "People's Army" published a commentary on March 20th condemning the Guam conference convened by American imperialists to plan the escalation of the war in Vietnam. The commentary points out that the more the United States attempts to increase military pressure on the Vietnamese people, the more it will suffer heavy defeats.

The commentary points out that Johnson's convening of the Guam conference to plan the escalation of the war in Vietnam blatantly exposes the extremely stubborn nature of American imperialism's aggression, while also proving that it is in a serious predicament in the Vietnam War.

The commentary points out that the American aggressors convened the Guam conference to plot military pressure on the Vietnamese people to the utmost, in an attempt to "end the war in the shortest possible time." However, the development of the Vietnam War has proven that the more the United States exerts "maximum pressure," the more it will face the strongest counterattacks from the Vietnamese people.

The commentary says that the development of the war is not determined by the subjective intentions of American imperialism. On the battlefield in Vietnam, the United States is strategically passive and tactically ineffective. The American aggressors and their lackeys have thrown in more than a million troops, yet they still cannot change the situation. Then, what problems can be solved by adding a few more troops and weapons?

The commentary says that Chairman Ho Chi Minh has already expounded on our nation's iron will: "The war may last five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild our country even more magnificently and splendidly!"

The commentary concludes by pointing out that the more frantically American imperialism expands the war, the more resolutely the Vietnamese people will advance, striking it down on the battlefield and resolutely smashing its aggressive ambitions.

    南越民族解放阵线发表声明严厉谴责关岛会议
    美帝任何战争“升级”都挽救不了败局
    越南《人民军队报》说越南人民决心给侵略者最有力的回击
    新华社河内十九日电　越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会发言人，十九日就约翰逊举行策划扩大侵越战争的关岛会议发表声明，严正警告美帝国主义者及其走狗：任何战争“升级”的阴谋和行动，都不能挽救它们在越南南方的惨败。
    声明指出，关岛会议是美国战争罪犯及其走狗讨论进一步加紧和扩大侵越战争计划的会议。
    声明指出，今年年初以来，约翰逊在越南南方的侵略战争和对越南北方的破坏战争中，遭到前所未有的失败后，一方面继续侈谈他的“和平诚意”，而另一方面则不断加紧并阴谋进一步加强侵越战争，妄图实现他的顽固的、阴险的侵略计划。
    声明在列举美国侵略者不断进行战争“升级”的罪行之后强调指出，很明显，约翰逊集团有关“和平”的一切论调都只不过是谎言。事实上，他们正在加紧准备对越南人民进行一场极端危险的军事冒险。他们举行的关岛会议，就是为了推行他们的阴险计划。
    声明说，美帝国主义在檀香山和马尼拉策划的战争计划已经和正在遭到可耻的失败。同样，他们目前在关岛策划的阴谋也定将遭到更加惨重和更加可耻的失败。
    声明最后说，美帝国主义任何野蛮的战争行动，都不能动摇越南南方人民的钢铁般的决心。越南南方人民决心同他们的北方同胞并肩战斗，给美国侵略者的一切战争“升级”行动以应有的惩罚，把抗美救国的神圣战争进行到彻底胜利。
    据新华社河内二十日电　越南《人民军队报》二十日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义召开策划扩大侵越战争的关岛会议，并且指出，美国越是妄图对越南人民加强军事“压力”，就越要遭到惨重的失败。
    评论指出，约翰逊召开策划扩大侵越战争的关岛会议，赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义极其顽固的侵略本性，同时也证明了它在侵越战争中陷入了严重的困境。
    评论指出，美国侵略者召开关岛会议，策划从军事上对越南人民“施加最大压力”，妄图“在最短的期间内结束战争”。但是，越南战争的发展过程证明，美国越是施加“最大的压力”，就越遭到越南人民最有力的回击。
    评论说，战争的发展不是由美帝国主义的主观意图所决定的。在越南战场上，美国的战略被动，战术不灵，美国侵略者和它的走狗投入了一百多万军队，仍然改变不了局面，那末再增加一些军队和武器，又能解决什么问题呢？
    评论说，胡志明主席早已阐明了我们民族钢铁般的意志：“战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。在胜利的日子到来的时候，我国人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！”
    评论最后指出，美帝国主义越疯狂地扩大战争，越南人民就越奋勇前进，狠狠地打，在战场上打败它，坚决粉碎它的侵略野心。
