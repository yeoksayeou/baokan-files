The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired the masses with unparalleled enthusiasm. Guizhou Province has launched a spring afforestation campaign. According to incomplete statistics, the entire province has already afforested 600,000 mu, of which 520,000 mu was completed after the seizure of power; the timber production volume is four times that of the two months before the seizure of power.

		From our correspondent: The Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province is vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously promoting production, launching a high tide of spring afforestation and timber felling and transportation. As of March 6, according to incomplete statistics, the entire province has already afforested 600,000 mu. Of this, 520,000 mu was completed by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in less than two months after the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions and the "three-in-one combination" seizure of power, which is six and a half times the total afforestation of the three months before the seizure of power. The timber production volume is approximately four times that of the two months before the seizure of power.

		Timber plays a very important role in the national economy, and its production quality directly affects national construction and people's lives. The Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province attaches great importance to forestry production. In the "Letter to the People of the Entire Province" and the "Order to Mobilize the Spring Plowing High Tide of Grasping the Revolution and Promoting Production," it emphasizes the importance of spring afforestation and timber felling and transportation, and has dispatched production inspection teams to various prefectures and counties to supervise forestry production.

		Under the call and leadership of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province, the Guiyang region first launched a spring afforestation campaign. The Guiyang municipal organs and local troops have successively mobilized more than 50,000 people, carrying Chairman Mao's portrait and holding up Chairman Mao's quotations, marching towards the barren mountains with high spirits. The mountains are covered with red flags, and the songs never stop. In one go, they planted more than 710,000 trees. The revolutionary masses in various prefectures and counties also took action upon hearing the news and launched the spring afforestation movement.

		The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the invincible Mao Zedong Thought widely known to the masses and mastered by them, promoting the ideological revolution of the people and inspiring great production enthusiasm. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses of Jinbao District, Zhenyuan County, are fighting on a mountain 1,500 meters above sea level. They proudly say: Yu Gong can move mountains, and we must be able to change the appearance of the barren mountains. The mountains are high, but our spirits are higher; the land is hard, but our bones are harder; the wind is strong, but our resolve is stronger. We must turn the barren mountains into a green sea of forests to serve socialist construction and people's lives. They can say it, and they can do it. In ten days, they afforested more than 4,700 mu, completing 50% of the annual afforestation task.

		The revolutionary workers who produce timber are not inferior. They vigorously promote timber production and strive to complete and overfulfill the state plan. The revolutionary workers of the Linye County Forestry Bureau have gone deep into the felling front line, and by the end of February, they have completed 70% of the annual production task.

		The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has tested, tempered, and improved the broad cadre of revolutionaries. They have cast aside all private thoughts and bravely joined the "three-in-one combination" production leadership cadre. The cadres at all levels of Xinglong Commune, Tianzhu County, have overcome their fears of making mistakes, making self-criticisms, giving blind orders, and improper work arrangements, and together with the representatives of revolutionary mass organizations and militia representatives, have firmly grasped the spring afforestation link, mobilized the masses, and launched a six-day offensive, completing the annual afforestation task.

    文化大革命焕发出广大群众的冲天干劲
    贵州省掀起春季造林高潮
    据不完全统计，全省已造林六十万亩，其中有五十二万亩是夺权以后完成的；木材生产量为夺权前两个月的四倍。
    本报讯　贵州省革命委员会狠抓革命，猛促生产，掀起了春季造林和采伐集运木材的高潮。截至三月六日止，据不完全统计，全省已造林六十万亩，其中五十二万亩是无产阶级革命派大联合，“三结合”夺权以后，在不到两个月里完成的，为夺权前三个月造林总数的六倍半，木材生产量为夺权前大约两个月的四倍。
    木材在国民经济生活中占很重要的地位，生产的好坏，直接影响着国家建设和人民生活。贵州省革命委员会很重视林业生产，在《告全省人民书》和《抓革命，促生产，掀起春耕大高潮的动员令》中，都强调了抓紧春季造林和木材的采伐集运，并且派出生产检查组到各专县督促林业生产。
    在贵州省革命委员会的号召与领导之下，贵阳地区首先掀起了春季造林热潮。贵阳市机关和当地驻军先后出动五万多人次，抬着毛主席画像，高举毛主席语录牌，斗志昂扬地向荒山进军。满山遍野，红旗招展，歌声不断，一举之下，植树七十一万多株。各专县的广大革命群众也闻讯而动，纷纷开展了春季造林运动。
    无产阶级文化大革命使战无不胜的毛泽东思想最广泛地同广大群众见了面，并为群众所掌握，促进了人们的思想革命化，焕发出极大的生产积极性。镇远县金堡区的广大贫下中农及革命群众战斗在拔海一千五百米的高山上，他们豪迈地说：愚公能移山，我们一定能改变荒山面貌。山高没有我们志气高，地硬没有我们骨头硬，风大没有我们决心大。我们一定要把荒山变成绿油油的林海，使它为社会主义建设和人民生活服务。他们说得出，做得到，十天造林四千七百多亩，完成全年造林任务的百分之五十。
    生产木材的革命职工也不示弱，狠抓木材生产，争取完成和超额完成国家计划，沿河县林业局的革命职工，深入采伐第一线，到二月底已完成全年生产任务的百分之七十。
    无产阶级文化大革命考验、锻炼、提高了广大的革命干部，他们丢掉各种私心杂念，勇敢地参加到“三结合”的生产领导班子里来。天柱县兴隆公社的各级干部，克服了怕犯错误，怕作检讨，怕说瞎指挥，怕工作安排不当等顾虑，和革命群众组织代表、民兵代表一起，紧紧抓住春季造林这一环，发动广大群众，突击六天，完成了全年造林任务。
