Mauritanian driver Moktar, who works with the Chinese agricultural survey team, jumped up excitedly in his house on the evening of February 18 while listening to the radio. His family, surprised, asked him, "What's wrong with you?" He immediately excitedly told his family, "I heard some very, very good news. China and Mauritania have issued a joint press communiqué. The communiqué says that the two countries have signed three agreements. This way we will receive more selfless aid from great China, and we will receive more Chinese brothers to help us build our country!" Finally, he praised, "Chairman Mao is truly great. He not only leads the Chinese people in revolution and construction, but he also cares for the people of Mauritania!"

    毛主席关心毛里塔尼亚人民
    同中国农业考察组一起工作的毛里塔尼亚司机莫克塔，二月十八日晚在收听毛里塔尼亚电台广播时，忽然高兴地在屋子里跳了起来。家里人惊奇地问他：“你怎么啦？”他立即激动地对家里人说：“我听到了一个非常非常好的消息，中国和毛里塔尼亚发表了联合新闻公报，公报说两国签订了三项协定。这样我们将要得到伟大中国的更多的无私援助，我们将要接待更多的来帮助我们建设的中国兄弟！”最后他赞扬说：“毛主席真伟大，他不仅领导中国人民进行革命和建设，而且还关心毛里塔尼亚人民！”
