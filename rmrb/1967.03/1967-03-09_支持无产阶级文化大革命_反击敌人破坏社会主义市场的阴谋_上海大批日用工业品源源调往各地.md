Shanghai's Large Quantities of Daily Industrial Goods Continuously Shipped to Various Places

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, SHANGHAI, March 7 -- Daily industrial goods produced in Shanghai are being continuously shipped to various places across the country. This is a practical action taken by the revolutionary faction of the commercial department to resolutely implement the great directive of Chairman Mao, "Grasp revolution, promote production," support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various places, support revolutionary comrades in smashing the new counterattack of the capitalist roaders, and consolidate the socialist economic front.

	The situation for the distribution of daily industrial goods is excellent, as evidenced by the sharp increase in the quantity of goods shipped out. In January, the commercial department in Shanghai shipped out 22,000 tons of cotton cloth, knitted fabrics, daily necessities, and cultural supplies. The shipment volume in February exceeded that of January by 23%.

	The commercial department in Shanghai is responsible for the glorious task of supporting the daily industrial goods market in cities and countryside across the country. This year, the distribution of goods has particular political significance. The revolutionary faction of the commercial department recognizes that, in the midst of the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially when a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party stir up the counter-revolutionary economic wind, plotting to undermine the socialist market, it is crucial to follow the national plan and strive to do a good job in the distribution of goods. This is a great support for the revolutionary faction in various places to repel the counter-revolutionary economic wind and uphold Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is not just a matter of supplying goods; it is a serious class struggle.

	The revolutionary faction of the commercial department in Shanghai, who emerged from the great "January Revolution" storm, united with the broad masses of revolutionaries and revolutionary cadres in the struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. They have firmly held their positions and insisted on doing a good job in the procurement and supply of daily industrial goods. After seizing power, their fighting spirit is even more ardent, and their sense of responsibility is even stronger. Some procurement and supply stations held "Grasp revolution, promote production" mobilization meetings, where revolutionary faction members took oaths to grasp revolution and promote production, determined to do an even better job in the distribution of daily industrial goods.

	Among the daily industrial goods shipped to various places this year, there are many iron water bottles, enamel basins, enamel cups, and ballpoint pens that have Chairman Mao's quotations printed or engraved on them. These are products made by Shanghai's revolutionary faction workers and revolutionary staff with their class feelings of boundless love, loyalty, belief, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao during the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary faction of the commercial department also regards the distribution of these goods as a major political task to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao and need to hang Mao Zedong Thought plaques on their bicycles. The revolutionary faction of the commercial department in Shanghai specially organized the production of these items, shipping tens of thousands to various places this year.

	The revolutionary faction of the commercial department in Shanghai applies Chairman Mao's great and brilliant strategic principle of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one" to the distribution of daily industrial goods. They timely ship the most necessary industrial goods to the most urgent places. In February, the key commodities such as cotton cloth, socks, soap, washing powder, and synthetic detergent shipped out all increased compared to January. During the shipment process, the revolutionary faction and revolutionary staff of the commercial department in Shanghai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, coordinated with revolutionary comrades on the transportation front to overcome the various obstacles set by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they fully utilized various means of transportation to load and ship as quickly as possible. Each procurement and supply station, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "advocating consideration for the overall situation," established joint transportation groups, arranged the distribution of goods according to their urgency, and ensured the priority shipment of key commodities.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The revolutionary faction of the commercial department in Shanghai responded enthusiastically to the great leader's call with their actual actions of actively shipping out cultural supplies, supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various places. In February, the shipment of mimeograph machines, printing machines, and advertising colors, which are tools and supplies needed by revolutionary organizations for printing and propaganda, increased significantly compared to January. After the Party Central Committee issued the call for middle and primary school students to return to school and make revolution, they promptly shipped out a batch of educational supplies for students. The broad revolutionary masses launched the "four bigs" (speaking out freely, airing views fully, writing big-character posters, and holding great debates), increasing the demand for paper. The revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses of the relevant procurement and supply stations actively cooperated with factories, adopting measures such as increasing train speed and adjusting varieties, to produce more big-character poster paper with the same amount of raw materials and working hours. They also implemented Chairman Mao's directive of "saving for revolution" and paid attention to saving expenses for revolutionary organizations. This year, a simple and convenient mimeograph machine produced by Shanghai factories is small in size, light in weight, and convenient to use and carry, while its price is less than half of the original ordinary mimeograph machine. More than half of the mimeograph machines planned to be supplied to various places in the first quarter are of this new type.

	Under the impetus of the great "January Revolution" storm, the industrial front in Shanghai has presented an unprecedented prosperous scene. With the steady increase in industrial production, the commercial department in Shanghai procured 9% more daily industrial goods in the first two months of this year than in the same period last year, providing a solid material foundation for the distribution of goods. However, the counter-revolutionary economic wind stirred up by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in Shanghai in the previous period had a wide-ranging impact. A prominent issue at present is that the transportation capacity is not yet adequate, which has brought some difficulties to the distribution of goods. Chairman Mao said: "Our difficulties are surmountable because we are a new and rising force with a bright future." The great leader Chairman Mao's teachings have greatly inspired and urged the revolutionary faction of the commercial department in Shanghai. They are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and confidence in victory, expressing their determination to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, bravely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, further strengthen cooperation with the revolutionary factions of the industrial and transportation departments, and ship out more and better daily industrial goods at an even faster speed to support the urban and rural markets.

    支持无产阶级文化大革命　反击敌人破坏社会主义市场的阴谋
    上海大批日用工业品源源调往各地
    新华社上海七日电　上海生产的日用工业品正在源源运往全国各地。这是商业部门的无产阶级革命派坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，支持各地无产阶级文化大革命，支持各地革命战友粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑，巩固社会主义经济阵地的一个实际行动。
    日用工业品调拨形势大好，集中反映在外调商品的数量直线上升。一月份，上海商业部门调出棉布、针棉织品、日用百货、文化用品等二万二千多吨；二月份的调运数量，超过一月份百分之二十三。
    上海商业部门担负着支援全国城乡市场日用工业品的光荣任务。今年调拨商品有着特别重大的政治意义。上海商业部门的无产阶级革命派认识到，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，特别是在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派煽起反革命经济主义黑风，阴谋冲垮社会主义市场的情况下，按照国家计划，努力作好商品调运工作，就是对各地无产阶级革命派击退反革命经济主义黑风、维护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的巨大支持。这不是一般的商品供应，而是一场严肃的阶级斗争。从伟大的“一月革命”风暴中“杀”出来的上海商业部门无产阶级革命派，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，团结广大革命群众和革命干部，坚守工作岗位，坚持作好日用工业品的采购供应工作。夺权以后，他们斗志更加昂扬，政治责任感更加强烈。有些采购供应站召开了“抓革命，促生产”的誓师大会，无产阶级革命派战士立下誓言，决心狠抓革命，猛促生产，把日用工业品的调拨工作做得好上加好。
    今年上海运往各地的日用工业品中，铁壳水瓶、搪瓷面盆、搪瓷口杯、圆珠笔等，都有不少是印着或刻着毛主席语录的。这是上海无产阶级革命派工人和革命职工在文化大革命运动中，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的阶级感情生产出来的。商业部门的无产阶级革命派，同样把调运这些商品看作是宣传毛泽东思想的一项重大政治任务。广大革命群众热爱毛主席，需要在自行车上挂上毛主席语录牌，上海商业部门的无产阶级革命派专门组织生产，今年来已调往各地几十万个。
    上海商业部门的无产阶级革命派，把毛主席“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”这一伟大英明的战略原则，具体运用到日用工业品的调拨工作上。他们把城乡人民生活最必需的工业品，及时运到最急需的地方去。二月份外调的棉布、袜子、肥皂、香皂、合成洗衣粉等重点商品，都比一月份增长。在调运过程中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海商业部门无产阶级革命派和革命职工，同交通运输战线上的革命战友协同作战，克服党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派设置的重重障碍，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，充分利用各种运输工具，尽可能快装快运。各个采购供应站遵循毛主席“要提倡顾全大局”的教导，成立了联合运输小组，分别轻重缓急，统一安排商品调拨，保证了重点商品的优先发运。
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”上海商业部门的无产阶级革命派以积极调运文化用品的实际行动，热烈响应伟大领袖的号召，支持各地文化大革命。二月份运出的速印机、油印机、广告色等革命组织需要的印制宣传品的工具和用品，比一月份显著增长。党中央发出中小学学生回校复课闹革命的号召以后，他们及时调出一批学生用的文教用品。广大革命群众展开大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，纸张用量增加。有关采购供应站的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，主动同工厂配合，采取加快车速、调整品种等措施，以同样数量的原料、工时，生产出了更多的大字报用纸。他们还贯彻执行毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的指示，注意为革命组织节约费用。今年上海工厂生产的一种简便油印机，体积小，分量轻，使用携带都很方便，而售价不到原来的普通油印机的一半。第一季度计划供应各地的油印机中，这种新型油印机占半数以上。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴的大好形势推动下，上海工业战线出现了一派前所未有的兴旺景象。随着工业生产的稳步上升，上海商业部门在今年头两个月中采购的日用工业品，比去年同期增长百分之九，为商品调运提供了雄厚的物质基础。但是，前一时期上海市党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派刮起的反革命经济主义黑风，流毒很广。当前比较突出的一个问题是运输能力还不相适应，给商品调运工作带来了一定的困难。毛主席说：“我们的困难是能够克服的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力。”伟大领袖毛主席的教导，极大地鼓舞和鞭策了上海商业部门的无产阶级革命派。他们满怀革命豪情和胜利信心，表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，勇敢地把革命、生产两副重担挑起来，进一步加强同工业、交通运输部门无产阶级革命派的协作，以更快的速度，调运更多更好的日用工业品，支援城乡市场。
