	Protesting the French "Citizens' Vote" Fraud and Supporting the Struggle for Independence of the People of the Somali Coast
	The People of Somalia Hold a Massive Demonstration
	Protesters Carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Chanting "Long Live China" and "Down with Johnson"

	Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, March 18th

	On the morning of the 18th, people from all walks of life in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, held a massive demonstration to protest the French plot to hold a so-called "citizens' vote" on the 19th in the Somali Coast (French Somaliland) and to resolutely support the struggle of the people of the Somali Coast for independence.

	The angry protesters carried photos of Mahamoud Harbi, the chairman of the Somali Coast Liberation Front who was assassinated by French imperialism in 1960, and placards with slogans such as "French imperialism, get out of Paris" and "The Somali Coast must be liberated." They marched directly towards the French and American embassies in Somalia. The demonstrators shouted slogans denouncing French President de Gaulle and "Down with Johnson!" and "Down with colonialism!"

	Arab and Pakistani residents in Somalia also participated in the demonstration, supporting the struggle of the people of the Somali Coast. They distributed a letter of protest to the public addressed to the French Embassy in Somalia, stating: "Do not interfere with French Somaliland. We are prepared for a persistent resistance movement."

	At the head of the procession, someone held up a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The people of Somalia chanted "Long Live China!" and "Down with American and French imperialism!"

	When the procession reached the gates of the French and American embassies, their anger reached its peak. They stopped and repeatedly shouted slogans denouncing French President de Gaulle and "Down with Johnson!"

	After nearly three hours of demonstration, people gathered in the Parliament Square. The acting Speaker of the National Assembly, Ahmed Komani Rubble, said:

	"De Gaulle's promise last September to allow the people of the Somali Coast to decide their own fate is hypocritical. We are very clear about the meaning of the 'citizens' vote.' This is a fake citizens' vote. The people of the Somali Coast can only win independence with their lives." He called on: "You must be prepared to sacrifice your lives for your compatriots in the Somali Coast."

	National Assembly member Said Farah Abdi spoke on behalf of the Assembly in a radio broadcast on the morning of the 18th, saying that the people of the Somali Coast are invincible. The days of colonialism and imperialism are numbered.

	Today, the entire city of Mogadishu was involved in the movement supporting the people of the Somali Coast, protesting the so-called "citizens' vote" planned by France in the Somali Coast.

	On the 16th, Somali Minister of Information Yusuf Adam Bukka revealed the French plot to hold a "citizens' vote" in the Somali Coast at a press conference held here. He listed various methods by which France manipulated the "citizens' vote." He said that women in the Somali Coast were deprived of the right to vote, and the "citizens' vote" on March 19th was held in the Somali Coast precisely during the dry season, when many nomadic Somalis moved in large numbers to find water and fresh grass, thus depriving a large number of voters of their voting rights; some political parties in the Somali Coast were also deprived of the right to engage in normal democratic activities, their leaders were imprisoned, and their members were massively exiled.

	The Somali Writers' Association issued a statement on the 16th saying: "The people of the Somali Coast are determined to drive out the French colonialists and bury the last French soldier." The statement said: "France should realize that it cannot stay in the Somali Coast."

    抗议法国举行“公民投票”骗局　支持索马里海岸人民争取独立斗争
    索马里人民举行声势浩大的示威
    游行群众手持《毛主席语录》，高呼“中国万岁”“打倒约翰逊”等口号
    新华社摩加迪沙十八日电　索马里首都摩加迪沙各阶层人民十八日上午举行声势浩大的示威，抗议法国策划十九日在索马里海岸（法属索马里）举行所谓“公民投票”；坚决支持索马里海岸人民争取独立的斗争。
    愤怒的游行群众高举着一九六○年被法帝国主义暗杀的索马里海岸解放阵线主席马哈茂德·哈比的照片和写着“法帝国主义，滚回巴黎”和“索马里海岸一定要解放”等字样的标语牌，径直向法国和美国驻索马里的大使馆行进。示威者在街上高呼谴责法国总统戴高乐和
  “打倒约翰逊！”“打倒殖民主义！”等口号。
    在索马里的阿拉伯和巴基斯坦人也参加了示威游行，支持索马里海岸人民的斗争。他们向公众散发的致法国驻索马里大使馆的抗议信写道：“不准你们干涉法属索马里，我们准备进行坚持不懈的抵抗运动。”
    在游行队伍的前列，有人手里高举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。索马里人民高呼“中国万岁！”“打倒美、法帝国主义！”
    当游行队伍来到法国和美国大使馆门前时，他们的愤怒情绪达到了最高潮。他们停下来不断地高呼谴责法国总统戴高乐和“打倒约翰逊！”等口号。
    在历时将近三小时的示威游行结束后，人们聚集在议会广场。国民议会代理议长艾哈迈德·克马尼·鲁卜勒发表讲话说：
  “戴高乐去年九月答应索马里海岸人民可以自由决定自己命运的诺言是虚伪的。我们很清楚‘公民投票’的含意。这是假公民投票。索马里海岸人民只有用他们的生命才能赢得独立。”他号召：“你们必须准备为你们的索马里海岸同胞献出生命。”
    国民议会议员赛义德·法拉赫·阿卜迪十八日上午代表议会发表广播讲话说，索马里海岸的人民是不可战胜的。殖民主义和帝国主义的日子不长了。
    今天，全摩加迪沙市都卷入了支持索马里海岸人民的运动，抗议法国在索马里海岸策划的所谓“公民投票”。
    索马里新闻部长优素福·阿丹·布卡十六日在这里举行的记者招待会上揭露法国在索马里海岸策划“公民投票”的阴谋时，列举了法国操纵“公民投票”的种种手法。他说，索马里海岸的妇女被剥夺了投票权，三月十九日的“公民投票”选择在索马里海岸正是旱季的时候举行，这时许多从事游牧的索马里人为了寻找水源和鲜草而大量移动，这样，大部分选民就被剥夺了选举权；索马里海岸的一些政党也被剥夺了从事正常民主活动的权利，它们的领导人被监禁，它们的成员被大规模地流放。
    索马里作家协会十六日发表声明说：“索马里海岸人民决心把法国殖民主义者赶走，把最后一个法国兵埋葬。”声明说：“法国应当认识到，它要赖在索马里海岸是办不到的。”
