The revolutionary faction of the Pingdu County supply and marketing cooperative system in Shandong Province, after hearing the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes" on the radio, was filled with joy and excitement. They unanimously agreed that this letter is the greatest trust and concern shown by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee towards the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels. Revolutionary workers immediately reproduced and distributed the letter, and studied it sentence by sentence in conjunction with their own work. Everyone expressed their determination to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," and organize manpower and material resources to actively support spring ploughing production.

The revolutionary faction of the county supply and marketing cooperative, during the Spring Festival, broke through various obstacles set by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and held two meetings with the heads of the grassroots cooperative and production brigade production teams. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great directive on "grasp revolution, promote production," analyzed the excellent situation and new characteristics of the rural market and agricultural production, and studied specific measures to improve market supply and support agricultural production. From the county cooperative to the grassroots cooperative, specialized teams were established and strengthened to support spring ploughing production. They also conducted investigations and research in advance in some production brigades on the needs for production materials this spring. Based on production needs, they conducted a comprehensive inventory and sorting, ensuring the availability of supplies. Currently, they are focusing on the timely transportation of major production materials such as fertilizers, ammonia water, pesticides, coal, and inner and outer tires for carts. They have also procured spring ploughing production materials urgently needed, such as deep plows, ammonia water seeders, hoes, shovels, and bamboo. At the same time, they arranged for local industrial departments to produce 120 types and 200,000 pieces of small farm tools such as shovels, large hoes, carrying baskets, and shoulder poles.

To facilitate the masses, the county cooperative, while carrying out the Cultural Revolution within the unit, dispatched more than 30 cadres to timely deliver goods to the countryside.

So far, the supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the county have supplied production brigades with 1,300 tons of chemical fertilizer, more than 400 water wheels and water conservancy tools, and more than 40,000 various small farm tools. At the same time, they organized technical personnel to go deep into the production brigades to help repair agricultural tools, ensuring that there is no delay in farming.

    把春耕需用物资及时供应农村
    本报讯　山东平度县供销社系统革命派，从广播里听了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》以后，人人欢欣鼓舞，一致认为，这是毛主席和党中央对贫下中农和各级干部的最大信任，最大关怀。革命职工把这封信立即翻印分发各处，并结合自己的工作情况逐条逐句学习。大家一致表示，坚决执行毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，组织人力、物力积极支援春耕生产。
    县社的革命派，在春节前后，冲破了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的种种阻力，召开了两次基层社队生产班子负责人会议，反复学习了毛主席关于
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，分析了农村市场和农业生产的大好形势和新特点，研究了搞好市场供应和支援农业生产的具体措施。从县社到基层社都建立和充实了支援春耕生产的专门班子，并提前深入到一部分生产队，对今春生产资料需要情况作了调查研究。根据生产需要，普遍进行了查仓排队，抓好货源落实。在当前突出抓紧化肥、氨水、农药、煤炭、推车内外胎等主要生产资料的调运，还购进了春耕生产急需的深耕犁、氨水耧、耘锄、铁锨、毛竹等生产物资。同时又安排当地工业部门，生产铁锨、大镢、抬筐、偏篓等小农具一百二十余种，二十余万件。
    为了方便群众，县社在搞好本单位文化大革命的同时，抽出三十多名干部，及时送货下乡。
    到目前为止，全县供销社已供应到生产队化肥一千三百多吨，水车及水利工具四百多件，各种小农具四万余件。同时还组织技术人员深入生产队，帮助检修农具，保证不误农时。
