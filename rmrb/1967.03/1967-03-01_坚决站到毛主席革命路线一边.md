I am a key leader of the Cultural Revolution movement at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. For a period of time, I implemented and executed the bourgeois reactionary line and participated in the criminal activities of a small clique within the former Municipal Committee to suppress the revolutionary student movement, committing serious errors.

On December 2, 1966, under the impetus of the citywide mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, I exposed the political conspiracy and various crimes of deceiving the Central Committee and Chairman Mao by a small clique within the former Municipal Committee to encircle and suppress revolutionary students. My actions immediately received the warm welcome and support of the revolutionary masses. However, those bourgeois gentlemen were terrified. They colluded with the pro-imperialist forces to put pressure on me, organize attacks, and label me as a "big traitor," threatening to "settle accounts" with me. In fact, their actions were not new. As early as November of last year, when I supported a comrade who dared to expose problems at a party meeting, a spy from the former Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department immediately jumped out to ridicule and attack me, saying, "You hand over your notebook and what you know to them, and they will definitely let you join them." Later, a small clique from the former Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department personally came to talk to me individually, saying things like "pay attention to collective leadership," "uphold principles," "expose problems by distinguishing between internal and external lines," and so on. These scoundrels even resorted to despicable means to sabotage my relationship with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

The fire of revolution is indomitable. The pressure from this small clique of bourgeois gentlemen only strengthened my resolve to fight against them. Later, I stood with the revolutionary comrades of the proletariat, learned from their thorough revolutionary spirit, humbly accepted their exposure, criticism, and help, and fought together with them against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. Recently, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat at our academy formally accepted me into the revolutionary rebel organization.

More than half a year of struggle has made me deeply realize that:

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has posed a very serious and sharp question for every cadre: to follow Chairman Mao or to slide down the bourgeois reactionary line? This is a fundamental question of whether one is revolutionary or counter-revolutionary. Everyone must make their own choice in this great revolutionary storm without the slightest hesitation. At first, I still wanted to protect the former Municipal Committee, fearing that I too would be associated with the reactionary line. Once, at a meeting to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat pointed out bluntly: "You are not protecting a person, but a bourgeois reactionary line. This relates to whether you follow Chairman Mao or someone else." This made me realize the gravity of the situation. Many cadres have consciously or unconsciously executed the bourgeois reactionary line and done things against Chairman Mao. If they still want to continue the revolution, they must immediately correct their mistakes, firmly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and work with the broad revolutionary masses in the Cultural Revolution to make their own contributions and redeem their past mistakes. Otherwise, they will cut themselves off from the party and the people.

Cadres who truly want to rebel must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls. After the broad revolutionary masses in the city rose up to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, I began to notice that there were problems with a small clique within the former Municipal Committee. But I did not have the courage to stand out and expose them. This was because the "self" in my mind was at work. What should I do? I brought these questions to my repeated study of the "Three Articles" and related documents. Through study and ideological struggle, my mind was liberated, and I made up my mind to abandon all selfish thoughts and firmly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Cadres who want to rebel with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat must put down their airs, be willing to be students of the masses, truly go among the masses, and humbly listen to the masses' criticisms and help. In the past, we were high and mighty, acting like officials and lords. In the Cultural Revolution, we executed the bourgeois reactionary line, placing ourselves in opposition to the masses and suppressing the revolutionary masses. Therefore, the revolutionary masses have every right to doubt and criticize us. Now, to win the understanding and trust of the masses, we must humbly listen to the masses' criticisms and thoroughly change our past erroneous positions. I deeply feel that the issue is not whether the revolutionary masses allow the cadres in power to rebel, but whether the cadres in power truly rebel and truly lay bare everything to the masses. As long as we truly do this, the masses will welcome, support, and trust us. The broad revolutionary masses criticize us to make us thoroughly break with the bourgeois reactionary line, uproot the revisionist roots in our minds, and deeply plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the revolutionary masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, showing their greatest concern and love for us cadres politically. We should not have any negative feelings about this; instead, we should use the revolutionary masses' criticism of us as an opportunity to strengthen our ideological revolutionization, firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and do our work better.

    坚决站到毛主席革命路线一边
    上海社会科学院党委第二书记、革命造反兵团战士　陆文才
    我是上海社会科学院文化革命运动的主要负责人，在一段时间内，贯彻执行了资产阶级反动路线，并参与了旧市委内一小撮人镇压革命学生运动的罪恶活动，犯了严重错误。
    去年十二月二日，在全市群众性批判资产阶级反动路线高潮的推动下，我揭发了旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派策划、部署围剿革命学生的政治阴谋和欺骗中央欺骗毛主席的种种罪行。我的行动，立即得到了无产阶级革命派的热烈欢迎和支持。但是那一小撮资产阶级老爷们却怕得要死，他们和保皇势力勾结在一起，对我施加压力，组织围攻，骂我是“大叛徒”，扬言要同我“算帐”。其实，他们这些做法并不新奇，早在去年十一月，当我在一次党的会议上，支持了敢于起来揭发问题的同志时，旧市委宣传部的坐探当场就跳出来讽刺打击我，说什么“你把笔记本和所知道的情况都交给他们，他们一定会吸收你参加。”此后旧市委宣传部一小撮人亲自出马找我个别谈话，说什么“要注意集体领导”，“要坚持原则”，“揭问题要分清内外界线”，等等。这些家伙还不惜用卑鄙的手段来破坏我和无产阶级革命派的关系。
    革命的烈火是扑不灭的。这一小撮资产阶级老爷们的压力，更加坚定了我与他们斗争的信心和决心，以后，我就和无产阶级革命派的同志们站在一起，学习他们彻底革命的精神，虚心接受他们对我的揭发、批判和帮助，同他们一起向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争。最近，我院的无产阶级革命派正式吸收我参加了革命造反派组织。
    半年多的斗争实践，使我深深地体会到：
    无产阶级文化大革命给我们每一个领导干部提出了一个十分严肃十分尖锐的问题：是跟着毛主席走，还是顺着资产阶级反动路线滑下去？这是革命不革命以至反革命的大是大非问题。每一个人都必须在这场革命的大风暴中作出自己的选择，决不允许半点犹豫。开始，我还想保旧市委，生怕自己也与反动路线挂上钩。有次在揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的大会上，无产阶级革命派一针见血地指出：“你保的不是那一个人，而是一条资产阶级反动路线，这关系到你跟毛主席走，还是跟谁走的问题。”这才使我大吃一惊，醒悟过来。许多领导干部过去自觉或不自觉地执行了资产阶级反动路线，做了对不起毛主席的事，如果还想继续革命的话，就应当立即改正错误，坚决回到毛主席的革命路线上来，和广大革命群众在一起，在文化大革命中做出自己的贡献，将功补过。否则，将自绝于党和人民。
    领导干部要真正起来造反，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命。在全市广大革命群众奋起批判资产阶级反动路线之后，我开始察觉到旧市委内的一小撮人有问题。但却没有勇气站出来揭发。这是头脑中的“私”字在作怪。怎么办呢？我带着这些问题，反复学习了“老三篇”和有关文件。经过学习和思想斗争，我思想解放了，下定决心抛弃一切私心杂念，坚决回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    领导干部要和无产阶级革命派一起革命，一定要放下架子，甘当群众的小学生，真正深入到群众中去，虚心听取群众的批评和帮助。过去，我们高高在上，做官当老爷，在文化大革命中又执行了资产阶级反动路线，把自己摆在同群众对立的立场上去了，镇压了革命群众。因此，革命群众完全有权利怀疑我们、批评我们。现在，我们要取得群众的谅解和信任，就要虚心听取群众的批评，彻底改变过去的错误立场。我深深感到，问题不在于革命群众是否允许当权派起来革命，而在于当权派是否真正起来革命，真正把底全部交给了群众。只要真正这样做了，群众就会欢迎你、支持你和信任你。广大革命群众批判我们，是为了使我们彻底地与资产阶级反动路线决裂，挖掉我们头脑中的修正主义根子，深深扎下毛泽东思想的根子。这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，对我们领导干部从政治上最大的关心和爱护。我们不但不能对此有任何消极情绪，相反应该借革命群众批判自己的东风，加强思想革命化，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把自己所担负的工作做得更好。
