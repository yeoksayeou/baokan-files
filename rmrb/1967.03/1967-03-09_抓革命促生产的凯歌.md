The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the soul. It must promote the ideological revolutionization of the people, fully mobilize the immense socialist enthusiasm latent among the masses, and do all work better, faster, more, and more economically.

After the revolutionary rebels of the Second Machine Tool Factory in Beijing took power, they managed and transformed the enterprise with the attitude of masters. They broke away from the bureaucratic old practices that had previously constrained the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, established a new revolutionary order, and fully unleashed the wisdom and creativity of the masses. The achievements of this workshop are not only a victory song of production leaps but also a victory song of ideological revolutionization.

People are the key factor. Machines are created and used by people. The same machines and equipment, due to different mentalities of people, will have vastly different production outcomes. Once people's thoughts are revolutionized, all work will develop rapidly and make great strides.

We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production," carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and welcome a new high tide in the socialist construction of our country!

Our workshop's proletarian revolutionary rebels suffered the most persecution and suppression under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. However, oppression breeds resistance. The reactionary attacks tempered us. In the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, we grew stronger with each battle, quickly transforming from a minority into a majority, becoming a strong revolutionary contingent in the entire factory. By the end of November last year, we took the lead in the entire factory, seizing the leadership of the cultural revolution in the workshop and establishing a cultural revolution preparatory group; on January 11 of this year, the workshop established a production management committee (including revolutionary cadres). From then on, we firmly grasped the fate of the workshop in the hands of the revolutionaries. We truly became the masters, and the workshop changed.

In the struggle for the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary rebels to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, some bureaucrats looked down on us, thinking that without them, we would be at a loss. There were also some political mediocrities who doubted our ability to shoulder the burdens of revolution and production. Let them see the thriving scene of our workshop after seizing power! Let them see our series of achievements in "grasping the revolution and promoting production"! Let them see the ability of our revolutionary rebels to build a new world!

In early January, when the bourgeois reactionary line was making a fierce comeback and the wind of economism was rampant throughout the factory, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory incited workers to demand better welfare and encouraged apprentices to go out and link up, seriously threatening production. At this critical moment, we revolutionary rebels stood up, turned the tide, resisted the evil winds, grasped the revolution, and promoted production. Not only did we not suffer production losses, but we also completed the January production plan three days ahead of schedule, creating a new record of "opening the year with a red start."

In the past, our workshop's production in January was the lowest. The past "routine" was to be relaxed at the beginning of the year and tight at the end. But this year is different. The production in January was two and a half times higher than the same period last year and equal to the highest production in December last year. This is a miracle that our workshop has never had before. In February, although there were only 28 days and we encountered the difficulty of missing parts, we revolutionary rebels still completed the task ahead of schedule. Our workshop used to take a month to assemble a precision machine tool, but now the fastest assembly takes only 12 days. More importantly, the workers' spiritual outlook has changed, and everyone is proud and spirited, full of fighting spirit. The entire workshop is full of enthusiasm and joy.

All of this is a resounding slap in the face of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a good wake-up call for those political mediocrities who doubt our construction capabilities.

Our victories fully demonstrate the immense power of the policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" proposed by Chairman Mao. Our victories are the result of a series of revolutionary measures taken in the process of seizing power, high举ing the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolution is to liberate productive forces. After seizing power, we broke away from the old practices that had previously constrained the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, truly transforming and managing the enterprise with the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. In the past, our workshop had more than 20 full-time cadres, with many idle hands. Some people were used to sitting in the office, listening to reports, and demanding figures. They only saw things, not people; they only focused on production, not on ideology. They rarely participated in production labor and knew little about the production situation. When workers encountered problems, they had to call for help or go upstairs to find someone. Some problems often went unsolved for a long time because of the cadres' pushing and pulling, making the workers very angry. Now, the members of our production management committee resolutely do not take leave, set up their desks in the teams, lead production in production, and discuss and solve problems with the masses. In this way, we can often hear the workers' opinions, address their urgent needs, and solve problems promptly. We are both managers of production and ordinary laborers; we care for the workers, and the workers care for us, and the relationship between people has undergone a new change.

In the past, cumbersome management systems made some easily solvable problems complicated, resulting in wasted manpower, delayed time, and affected production. In the past, workers could not directly contact cross-workshop tasks. Sometimes, for a single screw, they had to go through the section chief, workshop director, and production department head to get a stamp and a note before going to the processing workshop to solve it. Workers who wanted to innovate technology had to seek parts and materials, which was very troublesome. Workers said, "For a small matter, even thick legs would be worn thin!" Now, we have destroyed the past bureaucratic cumbersome systems, broken down the boundaries between teams and workshops, and production liaison personnel can directly solve the needs of production. What used to take days to solve now takes only a few minutes. The past long-standing "passing the buck" has been swept away. Everyone says that now things are done very smoothly. The old cumbersome management system was a shackle that constrained the masses' enthusiasm and initiative. Once the shackle is broken, the masses' wisdom and creativity burst forth like a volcano. This is an important reason for the improvement of our labor efficiency.

While breaking away from the old rules and regulations, we revolutionary rebels fully demonstrated the responsible spirit of the masters and the communist style, consciously observing labor discipline, and establishing a new revolutionary order.

We thoroughly buried the bourgeois "tutelage" style of leadership, changing the past situation of everything being arranged by the leadership and always being passive in production. Now the situation is: everyone manages, everyone comes up with ideas, and everyone takes the initiative. "Spring breeze and willows, ten thousand conditions, six billion people all become sages." There are many talents among the masses, and many "Zhuge Liang." When encountering difficulties, the workshop service personnel and team liaison personnel brief everyone, and solutions come. In the past, we often considered how to complete the work hours quota in production but did not pay much attention to the assembly of parts and components, nor did we care much about how to complete the overall product plan as soon as possible. Now, we pay attention to both individual work hours quotas and the overall effort to produce more products. Where there are difficulties, we go there; where there is a key point, we solve it there. At the critical moment of completing the production task, many of us slept and ate in the workshop, fighting day and night. In January, the grinding machine worktable was delayed for eight days, and many parts and components were not available. Under these circumstances, the assembly team initiated the completion of the task three days ahead of schedule. The entire workshop's revolutionary rebel workers joined forces, fully supported, provided people and parts, and ensured the realization of this initiative.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the source of our strength and the guarantee of our victory. We study Chairman Mao's quotations before and after work. Some comrades also find relevant quotations for production and ideological problems and paste them next to the machines to encourage and urge themselves. The assembly team had the heaviest task at the end of the month. The production liaison personnel organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations such as "carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)" and "make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This greatly inspired revolutionary enthusiasm.

In the past, under the oppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, we revolutionary rebels were suppressed, wanted to rise up, and our hearts were united. Now that we have taken power, our status has changed, from a minority to a majority, from powerless to powerful. In this new situation, non-proletarian thoughts are prone to emerge, posing new challenges to us. To consolidate and develop our victories, we need to study Chairman Mao's works more seriously than ever, master Mao Zedong Thought, wage ideological struggles, and eliminate selfish thoughts. We not only need to rebel against the capitalist-roaders within the party but also against the bourgeois thoughts in our own minds. Only in this way can our ranks be more united, maintain vigorous fighting spirit and thorough revolutionary spirit, and better unite the masses to grasp the revolution, promote production, and shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

Recently, under the unified leadership of the revolutionary rebel headquarters of the entire factory, we are carrying out rectification, seriously studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Opposing Liberalism," and the "Three Old Articles," summarizing the work of the previous stage, carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Through rectification, we help the responsible comrades of the revolutionary rebels correct their shortcomings, improve their work, better establish proletarian authority, and make them dare to and be good at working. At the same time, we overcome the non-proletarian thoughts of ultra-democracy and anarchism within the revolutionary rebel ranks, strengthen the proletarian revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, and further establish a new revolutionary order.

Chairman Mao said, "We not only are good at destroying an old world, but we also will be good at building a new world." Chairman Mao's teachings are a great inspiration and encouragement to us revolutionary rebels. We know that the victory of seizing power is only the first step of a long march, and the struggles ahead are still arduous, with many difficulties. However, we have made up our minds to thoroughly destroy the old world and build a new one. The final victory will definitely belong to the proletarian revolutionary rebels.

    抓革命促生产的凯歌
    北京第二机床厂革命造反车间  创新
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。它必然要促进人的思想革命化，把蕴藏在群众中间的无比巨大的社会主义积极性充分调动起来，把各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。
    北京第二机床厂革命造反车间革命派掌权以后，以主人翁的姿态来管理企业，改造企业，破除了过去那些束缚工人生产积极性、创造性的官僚主义的陈规陋习，建立起崭新的革命秩序，群众的智慧和创造力充分发挥出来，生产蒸蒸日上。这个车间所取得的成就，不仅是一曲生产跃进的凯歌，而且是一曲思想革命化的凯歌。
    人的因素第一。机器是人所创造的，为人所使用的。同样是那些机器，同样是那些设备，由于人的精神面貌不同，生产的面貌也就大不相同。人的思想革命化了，各项工作的发展就会日新月异，突飞猛进。
    我们要坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，迎接我国社会主义建设的新高潮！　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编　者
    我们车间的无产阶级革命派，在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下，受迫害和压制最大。但是，有压迫就有反抗。反动的围攻，锻炼了我们。在同资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，我们越战越强，很快地由少数变成多数，成为全厂的一支坚强的革命派队伍。去年十一月底，我们在全厂一马当先，夺取了车间文化大革命的领导权，建立了文化革命筹备小组；今年一月十一日，车间建立了生产管理委员会（吸收革命干部参加）。从此，我们把车间的命运牢牢掌握在革命派手中。我们真正当家做主了，车间变样了。
    在无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，有些官老爷瞧不起我们，以为离开他们就寸步难行，等着看我们的笑话。还有些政治庸人怀疑我们不能挑起革命和生产的重担。那就让他们看看我们车间夺权以后蓬勃兴旺的景象吧！看看我们“抓革命，促生产”的一系列成绩吧！看看我们革命派建设新世界的本领吧！
    今年一月上旬，正是资产阶级反动路线进行猖狂反扑，经济主义妖风在全厂泛滥的时候，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派挑动工人闹福利待遇，煽动学徒工外出串连，生产遭到严重的威胁。在这个关键时刻，我们革命派挺身而出，挽狂澜，顶妖风，抓革命，促生产，不仅没有使生产遭到损失，而且提前三天完成了一月份的生产计划，创造了年初“开门红”的新纪录。
    过去，我们车间一月份的产量是最低的。过去的生产“常规”是年初松，年末紧。而今年就大不相同了。一月份的产量，与去年同期的产量相比增加了两倍半，与去年十二月份的最高产量相等。这是我们车间历年来所没有过的奇迹。二月份，虽然只有二十八天，而且还遇到缺件的困难，但是我们革命派仍然提前完成了任务。我们车间过去装配一台精密机床，需要一个月，现在最快的十二天就装完了。更重要的是，工人的精神面貌改变了，个个扬眉吐气，精神振奋，斗志昂扬。整个车间到处热气腾腾，欢欣鼓舞。
    所有这些，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是一记响亮的耳光，对那些怀疑我们建设能力的政治庸人是一副很好的清醒剂。
    我们取得的胜利，充分显示了毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”方针的巨大威力。我们的胜利，是在夺权过程中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，采取了一系列革命措施的结果。
    革命就是要解放生产力。在夺权以后，我们打破了过去束缚工人生产积极性、创造性的陈规旧习，真正以无产阶级的革命精神来改造企业和管理企业。过去，我们车间脱产干部有二十几人，人浮于事，有些人习惯于坐办公室，听汇报，要数字。他们只见物，不见人；只抓生产，不抓思想。他们不深入群众，很少参加生产劳动，对生产情况心中无数，工人遇到问题，得打电话“请”，或者上楼去找。有些问题常常因为干部之间推拖扯皮，长期得不到解决，工人很气愤。现在，我们生产管理委员会的成员坚决不脱产，把办公桌设在班组，在生产中领导生产，有问题同群众一块商量解决。这样，我们就能经常听到工人的意见，急工人之所急，及时解决问题。我们既是生产的管理者，又是普通劳动者；我们关心工人，工人体贴我们，人与人之间的关系出现了新的变化。
    过去，烦琐的管理制度，使一些容易解决的问题，煞费周折，结果是浪费人力，耽误时间，影响生产。过去跨车间的活，工人不能直接联系。有时为了一个螺丝钉，要经过段长、车间主任、生产科长盖章领条，才能到加工车间解决。工人想搞技术革新，找个零件，用点料，东求西求，十分费事。工人们说：“为了一点小事，粗腿都要跑细了！”现在，我们摧毁了过去官僚主义的烦琐制度，打破了组与组、车间与车间的界限，生产需要什么件，生产联络员可以直接联系解决，过去几天办不到的事，现在几分钟就解决了。过去长期存在的“扯皮”之风，一扫而光。大家都说，现在办事痛快极了。旧的烦琐的管理制度，是束缚群众积极性和首创精神的枷锁。枷锁一被打破，群众的智慧和创造力就象火山一样迸发出来了。这是我们劳动效率提高的一个重要原因。
    在破除旧的规章制度的同时，我们革命派充分发扬了主人翁的负责精神和共产主义风格，自觉遵守劳动纪律，建立起革命的新秩序。
    我们彻底埋葬了资产阶级“训政”式的领导方法，改变了过去在生产上一切听领导安排、老打被动仗的局面。现在的情况是：生产上的问题，大家都管，大家都出主意，大家都主动。“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”群众中人材多得很，“诸葛亮”多得很。碰到困难，车间勤务员、小组联络员向大家一交底，办法就来了。
    过去我们在生产上常常考虑如何完成工时定额，而不大考虑零件、部件的成套，不大关心如何尽快地完成整个产品计划。现在，我们既注意个人的工时定额，又一个心眼为着整体，为着多出产品而努力。那里有困难，就往那里去；那里是关键，就到那里解决。在完成生产任务的紧要关头，我们许多人睡在车间，吃在车间，夜以继日地战斗。一月份，磨床工作台迟供应了八天，许多零件部件没有到齐，总装组在这种情况下，倡议提前三天完成任务。全车间的革命派工人同心协力，全力支持，要人给人，要件给件，结果保证了这一倡议的实现。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是我们力量的源泉、胜利的保证。我们在班前班后都要学毛主席语录，有的同志还针对生产上和思想上的问题，找出有关语录，贴在机器旁边，鼓励自己，鞭策自己。总装组月底任务最重，生产联络员就组织大家学习毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”和“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等语录，大大激发了革命干劲。
    过去在资产阶级反动路线的压迫下，我们革命派受打击，想翻身，心特别齐。现在掌权了，我们的地位发生了变化，由少数变成了多数，由无权变成了有权。在这种新的情况下，非无产阶级思想就容易冒出来，使我们面临着新的考验。为了巩固胜利，发展胜利，我们比过去更需要认真活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，开展思想斗争，破除私心杂念。我们不但要造党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，而且要造自己头脑中资产阶级思想的反。只有这样，我们的队伍才能更加团结，保持旺盛的战斗力和彻底的革命精神，才能更好地团结群众抓革命，促生产，挑起革命和生产两副重担。
    最近，我们在全厂革命造反总部的统一领导下，正在开展整风，认真学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、“老三篇”等光辉著作，总结前一阶段的工作，开展批评和自我批评。通过整风，帮助革命派的负责人改正缺点，改进工作，更好地树立无产阶级的权威，使他们更敢于和善于做工作。同时，克服革命派队伍内部出现的极端民主化、无政府主义等非无产阶级思想，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，进一步建立革命的新秩序。
    毛主席说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”毛主席的教导，是对我们革命派的巨大鼓舞和鞭策。我们知道，夺权的胜利，只是万里长征的第一步，今后的斗争还很艰巨，困难还很多。但是，我们彻底破坏旧世界、建设新世界的决心是下定了，最后胜利一定属于无产阶级革命派。
