The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the soul. It must promote the ideological revolutionization of the people, fully mobilize the immense socialist enthusiasm latent among the masses, and do all work better, faster, more, and more economically.

After the revolutionary rebels of the Second Machine Tool Factory in Beijing took power, they managed and transformed the enterprise with the attitude of masters. They broke away from the bureaucratic old practices that had previously constrained the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, established a new revolutionary order, and fully unleashed the wisdom and creativity of the masses. The achievements of this workshop are not only a victory song of production leaps but also a victory song of ideological revolutionization.

People are the key factor. Machines are created and used by people. The same machines and equipment, due to different mentalities of people, will have vastly different production outcomes. Once people's thoughts are revolutionized, all work will develop rapidly and make great strides.

We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production," carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and welcome a new high tide in the socialist construction of our country!

Our workshop's proletarian revolutionary rebels suffered the most persecution and suppression under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. However, oppression breeds resistance. The reactionary attacks tempered us. In the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, we grew stronger with each battle, quickly transforming from a minority into a majority, becoming a strong revolutionary contingent in the entire factory. By the end of November last year, we took the lead in the entire factory, seizing the leadership of the cultural revolution in the workshop and establishing a cultural revolution preparatory group; on January 11 of this year, the workshop established a production management committee (including revolutionary cadres). From then on, we firmly grasped the fate of the workshop in the hands of the revolutionaries. We truly became the masters, and the workshop changed.

In the struggle for the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary rebels to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, some bureaucrats looked down on us, thinking that without them, we would be at a loss. There were also some political mediocrities who doubted our ability to shoulder the burdens of revolution and production. Let them see the thriving scene of our workshop after seizing power! Let them see our series of achievements in "grasping the revolution and promoting production"! Let them see the ability of our revolutionary rebels to build a new world!

In early January, when the bourgeois reactionary line was making a fierce comeback and the wind of economism was rampant throughout the factory, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory incited workers to demand better welfare and encouraged apprentices to go out and link up, seriously threatening production. At this critical moment, we revolutionary rebels stood up, turned the tide, resisted the evil winds, grasped the revolution, and promoted production. Not only did we not suffer production losses, but we also completed the January production plan three days ahead of schedule, creating a new record of "opening the year with a red start."

In the past, our workshop's production in January was the lowest. The past "routine" was to be relaxed at the beginning of the year and tight at the end. But this year is different. The production in January was two and a half times higher than the same period last year and equal to the highest production in December last year. This is a miracle that our workshop has never had before. In February, although there were only 28 days and we encountered the difficulty of missing parts, we revolutionary rebels still completed the task ahead of schedule. Our workshop used to take a month to assemble a precision machine tool, but now the fastest assembly takes only 12 days. More importantly, the workers' spiritual outlook has changed, and everyone is proud and spirited, full of fighting spirit. The entire workshop is full of enthusiasm and joy.

All of this is a resounding slap in the face of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a good wake-up call for those political mediocrities who doubt our construction capabilities.

Our victories fully demonstrate the immense power of the policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" proposed by Chairman Mao. Our victories are the result of a series of revolutionary measures taken in the process of seizing power, highä¸¾ing the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolution is to liberate productive forces. After seizing power, we broke away from the old practices that had previously constrained the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, truly transforming and managing the enterprise with the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. In the past, our workshop had more than 20 full-time cadres, with many idle hands. Some people were used to sitting in the office, listening to reports, and demanding figures. They only saw things, not people; they only focused on production, not on ideology. They rarely participated in production labor and knew little about the production situation. When workers encountered problems, they had to call for help or go upstairs to find someone. Some problems often went unsolved for a long time because of the cadres' pushing and pulling, making the workers very angry. Now, the members of our production management committee resolutely do not take leave, set up their desks in the teams, lead production in production, and discuss and solve problems with the masses. In this way, we can often hear the workers' opinions, address their urgent needs, and solve problems promptly. We are both managers of production and ordinary laborers; we care for the workers, and the workers care for us, and the relationship between people has undergone a new change.

In the past, cumbersome management systems made some easily solvable problems complicated, resulting in wasted manpower, delayed time, and affected production. In the past, workers could not directly contact cross-workshop tasks. Sometimes, for a single screw, they had to go through the section chief, workshop director, and production department head to get a stamp and a note before going to the processing workshop to solve it. Workers who wanted to innovate technology had to seek parts and materials, which was very troublesome. Workers said, "For a small matter, even thick legs would be worn thin!" Now, we have destroyed the past bureaucratic cumbersome systems, broken down the boundaries between teams and workshops, and production liaison personnel can directly solve the needs of production. What used to take days to solve now takes only a few minutes. The past long-standing "passing the buck" has been swept away. Everyone says that now things are done very smoothly. The old cumbersome management system was a shackle that constrained the masses' enthusiasm and initiative. Once the shackle is broken, the masses' wisdom and creativity burst forth like a volcano. This is an important reason for the improvement of our labor efficiency.

While breaking away from the old rules and regulations, we revolutionary rebels fully demonstrated the responsible spirit of the masters and the communist style, consciously observing labor discipline, and establishing a new revolutionary order.

We thoroughly buried the bourgeois "tutelage" style of leadership, changing the past situation of everything being arranged by the leadership and always being passive in production. Now the situation is: everyone manages, everyone comes up with ideas, and everyone takes the initiative. "Spring breeze and willows, ten thousand conditions, six billion people all become sages." There are many talents among the masses, and many "Zhuge Liang." When encountering difficulties, the workshop service personnel and team liaison personnel brief everyone, and solutions come. In the past, we often considered how to complete the work hours quota in production but did not pay much attention to the assembly of parts and components, nor did we care much about how to complete the overall product plan as soon as possible. Now, we pay attention to both individual work hours quotas and the overall effort to produce more products. Where there are difficulties, we go there; where there is a key point, we solve it there. At the critical moment of completing the production task, many of us slept and ate in the workshop, fighting day and night. In January, the grinding machine worktable was delayed for eight days, and many parts and components were not available. Under these circumstances, the assembly team initiated the completion of the task three days ahead of schedule. The entire workshop's revolutionary rebel workers joined forces, fully supported, provided people and parts, and ensured the realization of this initiative.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the source of our strength and the guarantee of our victory. We study Chairman Mao's quotations before and after work. Some comrades also find relevant quotations for production and ideological problems and paste them next to the machines to encourage and urge themselves. The assembly team had the heaviest task at the end of the month. The production liaison personnel organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations such as "carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)" and "make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This greatly inspired revolutionary enthusiasm.

In the past, under the oppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, we revolutionary rebels were suppressed, wanted to rise up, and our hearts were united. Now that we have taken power, our status has changed, from a minority to a majority, from powerless to powerful. In this new situation, non-proletarian thoughts are prone to emerge, posing new challenges to us. To consolidate and develop our victories, we need to study Chairman Mao's works more seriously than ever, master Mao Zedong Thought, wage ideological struggles, and eliminate selfish thoughts. We not only need to rebel against the capitalist-roaders within the party but also against the bourgeois thoughts in our own minds. Only in this way can our ranks be more united, maintain vigorous fighting spirit and thorough revolutionary spirit, and better unite the masses to grasp the revolution, promote production, and shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

Recently, under the unified leadership of the revolutionary rebel headquarters of the entire factory, we are carrying out rectification, seriously studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Opposing Liberalism," and the "Three Old Articles," summarizing the work of the previous stage, carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Through rectification, we help the responsible comrades of the revolutionary rebels correct their shortcomings, improve their work, better establish proletarian authority, and make them dare to and be good at working. At the same time, we overcome the non-proletarian thoughts of ultra-democracy and anarchism within the revolutionary rebel ranks, strengthen the proletarian revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, and further establish a new revolutionary order.

Chairman Mao said, "We not only are good at destroying an old world, but we also will be good at building a new world." Chairman Mao's teachings are a great inspiration and encouragement to us revolutionary rebels. We know that the victory of seizing power is only the first step of a long march, and the struggles ahead are still arduous, with many difficulties. However, we have made up our minds to thoroughly destroy the old world and build a new one. The final victory will definitely belong to the proletarian revolutionary rebels.
