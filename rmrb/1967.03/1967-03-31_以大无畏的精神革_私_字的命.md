The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally, is a great revolution to overthrow the "private" character and establish the "public" character, to transform people's souls. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, the struggle between "public" and "private" within the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat becomes increasingly prominent and sharp. Whether or not one can correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism is the key to overthrowing the "private" character and establishing the "public" character, and to consciously carry out the revolution.

If a person always puts the "private" character first, is anxious about gains and losses, he will not be able to correctly treat himself, correctly recognize his own shortcomings and mistakes, nor will he be able to correctly treat others' criticisms and suggestions.

Those who lack self-criticism will find their path increasingly narrow, inevitably buried by their own mistakes, abandoned by the masses, and become transient figures on the stage of history.

Those who can seriously carry out self-criticism, bravely admit their own mistakes and shortcomings, will correct their mistakes in the great storms of class struggle, gradually grow, gain the support, trust, and endorsement of the masses, and forever be promoters of the revolution, forever preserving revolutionary youthfulness.

To carry out serious self-criticism is to attack the "private" character in one's mind at any time, to launch a fierce assault on one's own shortcomings and mistakes. Do not fear exposing one's thoughts, do not fear touching one's soul, do not fear losing "dignity." Liberate oneself from the "I," liberate oneself from the limitations of parochialism and factionalism. Making mistakes due to lack of experience can be forgiven, but insisting on mistakes due to lack of self-criticism is the most dangerous. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Any political party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable. We demand fewer mistakes. Having made mistakes, we demand correction. The quicker and more thorough the correction, the better."

To carry out serious self-criticism is to view oneself and one's unit dialectically, seeing one's strengths while also seeing one's weaknesses, humbly learning from others. View the criticism of comrades as the greatest concern from class brothers, view discovering and correcting mistakes as being responsible to the people. Be good at listening to different opinions, even if the opinions come from those who have made mistakes, do not reject them outright. Truly do as Chairman Mao said: "No matter who points out our mistakes, we should welcome it. If you are correct, we will correct it. If your method benefits the people, we will adopt it."

To carry out serious self-criticism is the fine style of proletarian revolutionaries, something that revisionists can never do. Continuously treat oneself as the object of revolution. Revolution also means overthrowing one's non-proletarian thoughts, seizing power also means seizing the power of the "private" character in one's mind. Thorough materialists are fearless. Proletarian revolutionaries not only fearlessly struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the reactionary bourgeois line, but also uncompromisingly struggle against the selfish thoughts and mistakes in one's own mind. "Dare to sacrifice oneself, dare to pull the emperor off his horse," in this great revolution to transform souls, we must also have this fearless spirit.

    以大无畏的精神革“私”字的命
    北京农机学院东方红公社　五洲风雷战斗队
    无产阶级文化大革命从根本上来说就是一场破私立公、改造人们灵魂的大革命。随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，无产阶级革命派内部“公”和“私”的斗争越来越突出，越来越尖锐。能不能正确地开展批评与自我批评，这是破私立公，自觉革命的关键。
    一个人如果总是“私”字当头，患得患失，他就不可能正确地对待自己，不可能正确地认识自己的缺点和错误，也不可能正确地对待别人的批评和建议。
    凡是缺乏自我批评的人，他们路子会越走越窄，终究不可避免地要被自己的错误所埋葬，为群众所抛弃，成为历史舞台上匆匆来去的过客。
    凡是能够认真进行自我批评，勇于承认自己的错误和缺点的人，他们就会在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不断修正错误，逐步成长起来，得到群众的支持、拥护和信任，永做革命的促进派，永葆革命青春。
    进行认真的自我批评，就是要随时向自己头脑中的“私”字发起攻击，对自己的缺点和错误猛冲猛打。不怕暴露思想，不怕触及灵魂，不怕失掉“尊严”。从“我”字中解放出来，从本位主义、山头主义的局限性中解放出来。由于缺乏经验而犯错误是可以原谅的，如果由于缺乏自我批评的精神而坚持错误，则是最危险的。我们应该牢记毛主席的教导：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”
    进行认真的自我批评，就是要一分为二地看待自己和本单位，在看到自己的优点时也要看到自己的短处，虚心向他人学习。把同志的批评，看作是阶级兄弟对自己最大的关怀，把发现和改正错误，看作是对人民负责。要善于听取不同的意见，即使是犯过错误的人提出的意见，也不要一概否定，真正做到“不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”
    进行认真的自我批评，是无产阶级革命者优良的作风，这是修正主义者根本办不到的。要不断地把自己当做革命的对象。革命，也得革自己非无产阶级思想的命，夺权，也得夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的，无产阶级革命派不但要毫不畏惧地和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗争，和资产阶级反动路线斗争，同时也要毫不妥协地和自己头脑里的私心杂念作斗争，和自己的错误缺点作斗争。“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”，我们在进行这场改造灵魂的大革命的时候，也必须有这种大无畏的精神。
