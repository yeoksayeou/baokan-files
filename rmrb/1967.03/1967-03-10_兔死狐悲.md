Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has openly sided with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our party, sympathizing with them, and giving them support. Recently, Soviet head of state Kosygin personally came out to express "sympathy" for the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements in our country. The editorial article "On the Events in China" published by the Soviet Union's *Pravda* on November 27 last year, maliciously slandered the great proletarian cultural revolution in China as using young students to "attack party cadres and outstanding representatives of the working class"; it said that "party and state cadres, scientists, literary and artistic figures are called 'black gang members,'" and have been "attacked." This is truly a case of "the fox mourns the rabbit's death, and fellow creatures feel pity."

Dear editors of *Pravda*, you are right. We are indeed attacking, and not only attacking but also overthrowing. However, what we are attacking and overthrowing are not party cadres and outstanding representatives of the working class, nor are they party and state cadres, scientists, literary and artistic figures. What we are attacking and overthrowing is the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. As stipulated in the Sixteen Points, which were personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, "The focus of this movement is to rectify those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road." "Concentrate forces to strike at a handful of extremely reactionary rightist elements of the bourgeoisie and counter-revolutionary revisionists, fully expose and criticize their anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes, and isolate them to the greatest extent possible." For these harmful elements, our policy is to resolutely strike them down! Resolutely overthrow them!

Strange news has always existed, but now there is even more. China is conducting a great proletarian cultural revolution on its own territory, attacking a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and counter-revolutionary revisionists. This is a natural and just cause, so why does it provoke such hysteria from the old gentlemen in the Kremlin?

Why is this?

China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been advancing with great momentum for more than ten months, sweeping all obstacles aside. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party have been scattered and defeated. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat have united to seize their power, achieving one victory after another in our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The people of China and revolutionary people around the world cannot help but applaud. This great revolutionary storm has given a powerful shock to the old world, and the walls of the Kremlin have been shaken. In a word, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution strikes at the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China, and it hurts the Soviet revisionists. They come out to curse and shout, but it is only "a few wails, a few sobs." China is conducting a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to oppose revisionism, prevent revisionism, and uproot the roots of revisionism. This has shattered the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's dream of a capitalist restoration in China. The fox mourns the rabbit's death; this is nothing surprising.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, with their counter-revolutionary instincts, sense that their doom is approaching. They fear the truth, fear the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism, and fear the influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution spreading to the Soviet Union, awakening the Soviet people to rise up against them. Thus, on the one hand, they strictly block the true situation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the other hand, they rely on spreading rumors and slanders to make a living, mobilizing all their propaganda machines to attack China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launching a new wave of anti-China hysteria. They think they have succeeded. Little do they know that the voice of truth cannot be suppressed. Whether you fear or curse, the revolutionary tide is unstoppable, and your "throne" will eventually be overturned. History will prove this.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." He also says: "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, defaming us as utterly worthless, that is even better. It not only means that we have drawn a clear line with the enemy but also proves that our work has achieved great results."

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique is so vigorously opposing us, which precisely shows that we are right and doing well! We must even more resolutely carry this out and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    兔死狐悲
    自从我国无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，苏修统治集团就公然站在我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派一边，为他们鸣冤叫屈，给他们撑腰打气。最近，苏修头目柯西金亲自出马，对我国的反革命修正主义分子表示“同情”。苏联《真理报》去年十一月二十七日发表的《评中国的事件》的编辑部文章，大肆诽谤中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命是利用青年学生“打击党的干部和工人阶级的优秀代表”；说什么“党和国家工作人员、科学、文学和艺术活动家被称为‘黑帮分子’”，遭到了“打击”。这真是“兔死狐悲，物伤其类”。
    可爱的《真理报》先生们，你们讲对了，我们就是要打击，不仅要打击，还要打倒。不过我们要打击、打倒的不是党的干部和工人阶级的优秀代表，也不是党和国家的工作人员、科学、文学和艺术活动家。我们要打击、打倒的是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。正如由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条中所规定的那样：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”“集中力量打击一小撮极端反动的资产阶级右派分子、反革命修正主义分子，充分地揭露和批判他们的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，把他们最大限度地孤立起来。”对于这些害人虫，我们的方针就是要坚决打击！坚决打倒！
      “奇闻”历来有，如今特别多。中国在自己的领土上进行伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，打击一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和反革命修正主义分子，这是天经地义的事情，为什么会引起克里姆林宫老爷们的歇斯底里大发作呢？
    这是为什么呢？
    中国搞无产阶级文化大革命，十个多月来势如破竹，所向披靡。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，被打得七零八落。无产阶级革命派联合起来夺了他们的权，使我国无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个的胜利。我国人民和世界革命人民，无不为之拍手称快。这场伟大的革命风暴，给整个旧世界以猛烈的冲击，克里姆林宫的城墙也被震动得摇摇晃晃。一句话，中国无产阶级文化大革命，打在中国的反革命修正主义分子的身上，痛在苏修的心上。他们跳出来骂街，只不过是“几声凄厉，几声抽泣”而已。中国搞无产阶级文化大革命，是为了反修防修，挖修正主义的根子。这就使苏修统治集团幻想中国出现资本主义复辟的梦想破灭了。兔死狐悲，这是不足为奇的。
    苏修统治集团凭着反革命的嗅觉预感到，他们的末日就要来临了。他们害怕真理，害怕伟大的马克思列宁主义的光辉，害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响传入苏联，会唤醒苏联人民起来造他们的反。于是，他们一方面严密封锁中国无产阶级文化大革命的真实情况，另一方面专靠造谣污蔑过日子，开动一切宣传机器，攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命，掀起反华新高潮。他们自以为得计。殊不知真理的声音是封锁不住的。你们怕也好，骂也好，革命的潮流是阻挡不了的，你们的“宝座”迟早是要被打翻的，历史的发展必将证实这一点。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”又说：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    苏修统治集团这样起劲地反对我们，恰恰说明我们做得对，做得好！我们更要坚决这样做，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
