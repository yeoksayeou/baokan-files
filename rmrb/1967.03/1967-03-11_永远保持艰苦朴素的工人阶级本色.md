"To economize and make revolution."—This is the call made by our great leader Chairman Mao.

This call has been enthusiastically responded to by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Shanghai Instrument Wire Factory has modelly carried out the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. As they themselves say, "We make revolution, spending no money, not leaving our posts, and not needing offices." Their flag is small and old, but it is precisely this flag that embodies the thrifty and modest character of the working class, becoming a glorious banner.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Shanghai Instrument Wire Factory puts the collective first, always considering the interests of the state. They use as little as possible of various supplies, understanding that every piece of paper and every piece of cloth is hard-won and is the property of the people, and should be cherished with an owner's attitude. This is the noble quality of the working class.

The proletarian revolutionary faction must be thrifty and modest before taking power and must remain thrifty and modest after taking power. Especially after taking power, when their status changes, they face new tests. On the eve of our party taking national power in 1949, Chairman Mao sounded the alarm for the entire party. He pointed out: "Because of victory, arrogance, the attitude of considering oneself a hero, the attitude of stopping progress and not seeking advancement, the attitude of indulging in pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow within the party.... The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and comrades must continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle." Over the past seventeen years, some people in the party have forgotten Chairman Mao's warning, discarded the fine tradition of hard struggle of our party, become officials and lords, detached from the masses, enjoyed privileges, did not achieve new merits, and relied on old ones. A handful of people have degenerated into a clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road. This is truly shocking!

Now, the proletarian revolutionary faction has risen up to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. The proletarian revolutionary faction that has won the seizure of power should heed this historical lesson, continue to carry forward and maintain the fine tradition of thrift and modesty, and stand up to all tests.

Economize and make revolution. All revolutionary mass organizations should mobilize those who have left their posts to return to their original production positions. This is not only to promote socialist economic construction but more importantly to keep the thoughts of the proletarian revolutionary faction forever red, not to be infiltrated by the old ideas, old styles, and old habits of the bourgeoisie. Extravagance and officialdom are the styles of the exploiting class, which the Cultural Revolution aims to eliminate. We proletarian revolutionaries must be vigilant and not be infected with these bad styles.

In this regard, the revolutionary faction of the Shanghai Instrument Wire Factory has set an example for us. After seizing power, they still maintain the unarrogant and unhurried character of the working class, do not seek pomp and extravagance, insist on participating in production, and insist on maintaining close ties with the masses. They have changed the old face of the factory under the rule of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, according to the worldview of the proletariat, established a new type of relationship between leaders and the masses, promoted the ideological transformation of people, and thus greatly developed the productive forces. This is worthy of serious study by all revolutionary comrades.

    永远保持艰苦朴素的工人阶级本色

    “要节约闹革命。”——这是我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的号召。
    这个号召，得到了全国各地无产阶级革命派的热烈响应。上海仪表游丝厂的无产阶级革命派，模范地执行了伟大领袖毛主席的指示。正如他们自己所说，“我们干革命，一不花钱，二不脱产，三不要办公室。”他们的队旗，又小又旧，可是正是这面旗帜表现了工人阶级艰苦朴素的本色，成了一面光荣的旗帜。
    上海仪表游丝厂的无产阶级革命派，他们“公”字当头，处处为国家打算，各种用品能不用的就不用，能少用的就少用。他们懂得，一张纸，一块布，都是来之不易的，都是人民的财产，要以主人翁的态度爱惜它。这是工人阶级的崇高品质。
    无产阶级革命派在掌权以前，要艰苦朴素；在掌权以后，仍然要艰苦朴素。特别是在掌权以后，地位改变了，这就面临着新的考验。在一九四九年我们党取得全国政权的前夕，毛主席就向全党敲起了警钟。他指出：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”十七年来，党内有一些人忘掉了毛主席的警告，抛掉了我们党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，做官当老爷，脱离群众，养尊处优，不立新功，单吃老本，有一小撮人堕落成为走资本主义道路的当权派。这是多么使人触目惊心的事啊！
    现在，无产阶级革命派起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权了。取得夺权胜利的无产阶级革命派，应该记取这个历史的教训，继续发扬和保持艰苦朴素的优良作风，经得起一切考验。
    节约闹革命，各个革命群众组织要动员脱产人员回到原生产岗位上去，这不仅是为了促进社会主义经济建设，更重要的是使无产阶级革命派的思想永远保持鲜红的颜色，不为资产阶级的旧意识、旧作风、旧习惯所侵蚀。阔气和官气，都是剥削阶级的作风，是文化大革命所要破除的，我们无产阶级革命派，一定要警惕自己，不要沾染这种坏作风。
    在这方面，上海仪表游丝厂的革命派为我们树立了一个榜样。他们在夺权以后，依然保持不骄不躁、艰苦朴素的工人阶级本色，不讲排场，不讲阔气，坚持参加生产，坚持密切联系群众。他们按照无产阶级的世界观，改变了工厂在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派统治时的旧面貌，建立了领导与群众的新型关系，促进了人的思想革命化，从而使生产力大大发展。这是值得一切革命同志认真学习的。
