Chairman Mao said: "The world belongs to you, it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you."

In the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world, the revolutionary youth of China, nurtured by the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, launched the Red Guard movement, hailed as a great innovation in the international communist movement. This new and vigorous force, just emerging from the eastern horizon, immediately received the warm care and enthusiastic encouragement of our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said to the Red Guard youth: "I firmly support you!" Since then, the Red Guards have continued to grow and become a vast army of cultural revolutionaries.

Revolutionary actions that shook the world

The Red Guards, as soon as they appeared, won the enthusiastic praise of revolutionary people around the world with their fearless revolutionary spirit and earth-shaking revolutionary actions. The year the Red Guards took to the revolutionary stage, 1966, was called the "Year of the Red Guards" by the world's revolutionary people. The birth of this "most advanced type of revolutionary youth organization in human history" and their revolutionary actions became one of the world's major events. Revolutionaries around the world expressed active support and firm support for the Red Guards, enthusiastically hailing China's young revolutionary vanguards as excellent! Some progressive newspapers in other countries published editorials and articles titled "Long Live the Red Guards" to celebrate the birth of the Red Guards; published special issues on the Red Guards, introducing their revolutionary deeds. Italian and French revolutionary youth published newspapers or magazines named "Red Guards" to spread revolutionary truths and promote revolutionary rebellion. Young students in many countries held discussions and put up wall newspapers, expressing their desire to learn from the "new generation nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought." How many poets wrote poems praising "Mao Zedong's Little Red Soldiers," and how many artists composed songs to sing the praises of China's "young red rebels." Revolutionary people in various countries all regarded the Red Guards as their "closest comrades-in-arms." Lao writer Souvan Phouma, fighting on the front lines of the anti-American patriotic struggle, wrote a poem titled "To the Red Guard Warriors" with deep emotion, and personally transcribed the poem in Lao script on a red silk banner, asking Chinese friends to deliver it to the Chinese Red Guards. A Polish worker handed a bouquet of flowers, which he considered the "most beautiful in the world," to a Chinese comrade, and said excitedly: "Please present it to the great leader of the working class, Mao Zedong, to the revolutionary youth of China— the Red Guards—who emerged in the cultural revolution under Mao Zedong's leadership, and to the great cultural revolution." When five Chinese students studying in Hungary were unreasonably ordered to return to China by the Hungarian government, a Hungarian university student hid several copies of Chairman Mao's selected works in his chest, evading police surveillance, and went to see them off. He said on behalf of the revolutionary youth of Hungary to the Chinese students: "Please convey our respect to the Chinese people and the Red Guards, and tell them: We will always stand with you!" A friend from "French" Somalia, Dahane, expressed to the Chinese Red Guards: "We fully support your daring, bold, revolutionary, and rebellious proletarian revolutionary spirit."

A revolutionary vanguard, a grave digger of imperialism and revisionism

From different regions and different battlefields and workplaces around the world, many revolutionaries often write letters to the "vanguard of world revolution"—the Chinese Red Guards to express their congratulations. Like the "Albanian people who soar into the clouds," the Vietnamese soldiers fighting bravely on the anti-American front, the youth of Lenin's hometown who are determined to fight modern revisionism to the end, and the descendants of the Paris Commune who are awakening anew, all sent their combat greetings to the Chinese Red Guards. A friend from Southwest Africa, Kanju, pointed out, "All revolutionary people around the world express their respect to the young and brave Red Guards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is because "the Chinese Red Guards are an unprecedented revolutionary vanguard in the world." Many revolutionaries in other countries also pointed out that the Red Guards are the proud proletarian tradition of the Paris Commune, the Red Guards of October, and the Chinese Red Army, and the grave diggers of imperialism and revisionism. Famous Japanese figure Miyazaki Seiken praised the Red Guards as "the purest, smartest, most awakened, bravest, and most revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought." A friend from Burma praised the Red Guards as "the reddest, most revolutionary, and most proletarian revolutionary successors in history." Revolutionaries from various countries deeply admired the Chinese Red Guards for their "firm stance, clear banner, clear distinction between friends and enemies, clear right and wrong, great courage, sufficient confidence, strong momentum, and swift action"; they admired their "strong hatred towards the enemy and deep affection for the people." A Polish friend expressed his belief: "With the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, the world's revolutionary people have nothing to fear." A Panamanian poet in a poem titled "To the Radiant Flag of the Peoples of Various Countries, Comrade Mao Zedong" wrote:

The Red Guards are the most magnificent title
of the defenders of the sacred cause of the proletariat.
Who does not know,
The Red Guards raise the red flag,
Fighting across the Yellow River and the Yangtze River,
Following the great teacher Mao Zedong
On the victorious path he pointed out!

The defenders of great Mao Zedong Thought

Under the firm support and close cooperation of the powerful army of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Chinese Red Guards are "creating history," "creating miracles," and "creating great revolutionary merits"; the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards "will forever be recorded in the annals of class struggle led by the proletariat." This is the evaluation of the world's revolutionary people on the heroic revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. The Italian magazine "Marxist-Leninist Youth" pointed out: "The struggle of the Red Guards is China's people's greatest contribution to human development." Albanian Labor Party Politburo member and Secretariat member Kaba praised the Red Guards for "fighting firmly, bravely, and tenaciously for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for smashing the rightists and revisionists, for smashing the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the traitorous Soviet leadership, for defending the Marxist-Leninist line of Chairman Mao, and for making this line victorious." The French "Humanité" newspaper pointed out: "Under the leadership of the contemporary Lenin—Mao Zedong, the young Red Guards of China are cleansing the past mud and filth, eliminating all the poisons of feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism, and paving the way for China's great leap forward. Their experiences and victories will all contribute to the international communist movement of Marxism-Leninism." The National Executive Committee of the Belgian Communist Youth Movement in a resolution said: "The Red Guards, who are loyal to the revolutionary traditions of the older generation and take the glorious People's Liberation Army as their example, have become a new tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat."

Revolutionary people around the world enthusiastically praised the Chinese Red Guards as "a million-strong army that fearlessly charges into the old world under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao," as "loyal executors of the great destruction of the old four elements of the exploiting class and the great establishment of the new four elements of the proletariat," as "destroyers of the old world and creators of the new world." A Yemeni poet who had visited China was deeply moved by the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards the day before they took to the streets in Beijing to sweep away the "four olds." That day, he could not help but write a poem praising the Red Guards:

"Chinese young warriors,
Students of Mao Zedong!
You are defending the red tomorrow,
Defending the glorious cause of the Party,
Defending the great East of Mao Zedong's China, the world of workers, peasants, and soldiers!"

The leader of the Sri Lankan Communist Party, Samugathasan, highly praised, "The Red Guards accomplished in a few days and weeks what could not be done in several decades," and they were like a torrent, "cleansing everything that opposed the revolution."

All revolutionaries around the world admire the Chinese Red Guards for their "limitless loyalty to and love for Chairman Mao, loyalty to Marxism-Leninism." Albanian Labor Party Politburo member and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Balluku pointed out: "The Red Guard warriors have well and accurately executed Chairman Mao's instructions and are firmly advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary path, defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao." Many revolutionaries in other countries pointed out that the Red Guards "enthusiastically study Mao Zedong Thought, implement Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Mao Zedong Thought," and they are "worthy defenders of great Mao Zedong Thought" and "the vanguard of propagating Mao Zedong Thought." Nepalese friend Govinda pointed out that the Red Guards are "the outstanding generation of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people because they read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." A Sri Lankan friend, when talking about his visit to China, said: "We heard the Red Guards reciting Chairman Mao's quotations everywhere, singing songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Guards showed their boundless love and revolutionary enthusiasm for Chairman Mao, infecting everyone." Many young people in Tanzania, while watching the film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolutionary Army," saw the Chinese Red Guards loudly reciting Chairman Mao's quotations on the screen, and they also enthusiastically recited along. A young person from a West African country expressed his desire to be like the Chinese Red Guards, carrying and studying the revolutionary treasure—the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at all times, and was determined to fight for the liberation of his country.

The hope of revolutionary people around the world

In the fiery trial of this cultural revolution, the Chinese Red Guards have become "the powerful reserve force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and "the Great Wall of ten thousand li defending red China." Revolutionary people around the world "feel the joy of victory and have strong confidence in China's future." The Australian "Vanguard" newspaper pointed out that the Red Guards are "breaking down private interests and establishing public interests," "transforming themselves into perfect people." Japanese progressive friends praised the Red Guards for "determining to temper themselves in the fiery trial of the cultural revolution into reliable successors of the revolutionary cause who are not afraid of hardship or death, who are wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution, and who serve the people wholeheartedly." A Burmese youth firmly believed that with the daring and revolutionary Red Guard youth, "the proletarian regime of China will forever be an iron-clad mountain." A Tanzanian friend said: "The Red Guards have declared to the world that the East must remain red!" Two revolutionaries from Southwest Africa expressed their belief: "Chinese youth listen to Chairman Mao's teachings and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, taking the People's Liberation Army as their example, China will never change color." Some revolutionaries in other countries also pointed out: "The Chinese Red Guards will definitely pass on the revolutionary baton from generation to generation, forever holding high the flag of the world proletarian revolution."

Revolutionary people around the world regard the Chinese Red Guards as "the hope of the world's revolutionary people." They say that the Chinese Red Guards are "the reddest and most revolutionary vanguard of the world revolution," and "vanguard warriors of proletarian internationalism." Uruguayan cultural figure E. S. Porta said: "The Red Guards are not only the vanguard of the Chinese revolution but also the vanguard of the world revolution." An American friend pointed out that the Red Guards "have the Chinese revolution and the entire world revolution in their hearts. The standard they use to distinguish right from wrong in their hearts is Mao Zedong Thought, the interests of the proletariat, the interests of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution." A representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) pointed out, "The Red Guards are carrying out a mission with internationalism," and they are "firm fighters against international imperialism and resolute supporters of the struggle of the oppressed people." The Singapore "Frontline" newspaper pointed out that the Red Guards "have become the sworn enemies and destroyers of capitalism and revisionism," "how can imperialism and big and small ghosts and snakes not be in a state of panic, weeping and wailing, gnashing their teeth, and despairing?"

The revolutionary rebellious spirit inspires young people in various countries

The Chinese Red Guards have set an unprecedented brilliant example for the world's revolutionary youth. Many revolutionaries said, "The revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards greatly inspired the revolutionary youth around the world," and it "will forever inspire the youth fighting around the world to advance." Many revolutionary youth in various countries expressed their desire to "learn from the Red Guards with respect" and to "follow the Red Guards forward." A young person from an African country expressed his desire to be like the Red Guards, forever a revolutionary rebel, and to follow Mao Zedong Thought forever to make revolution. A friend from an Asian country said: "The Red Guards have shown the youth the path of truth." A friend from another Asian country said: "We will follow the path of the Red Guards and spread the daring, bold, and revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards." A Japanese middle school student said: "The Chinese Red Guards are of the same age as us, but they are fearless and are doing great things. We admire them and should learn from them." Some revolutionary youth under the rule of the modern revisionist clique in the Soviet Union decided to carry forward the spirit of the Chinese Red Guards and "raise Lenin's revolutionary torch." Now, some progressive youth in various continents have named their organizations "Red Guards." Brazilian friend Martines said well: "Compared to the billions of new-type heroes who will appear in the world armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the stars in the sky will seem too few. These new-type heroes will shine like stars forever in the red universe of the proletariat."

Under the inspiration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, under the inspiration of the revolutionary rebellious spirit of the Chinese Red Guards and tens of millions of other revolutionary masses, a batch of daring, bold, and revolutionary young revolutionary vanguards will definitely emerge in the fiery trial of the world revolution, and a red world will definitely be born in the great storm of the world revolution!

They listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, bravely making revolution. They are right! They are doing well!

    万岁！中国的革命闯将红卫兵
    ——外国朋友欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命
    毛主席说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”
    在震撼全世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨中，由战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育成长的中国革命青少年，发起了被誉为国际共产主义运动伟大创举的红卫兵运动。这一具有强大生命力的新生事物刚刚从东方地平线上出现，就得到了我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和热情鼓励。毛主席对红卫兵小将们说：“我坚决支持你们！”从此，红卫兵不断发展壮大，成为一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。
      革命行动震撼全世界
    红卫兵一出现，就以他们大无畏的革命精神和惊天动地的革命行动博得全世界革命人民热烈的赞扬。红卫兵走上革命舞台的一九六六年，被世界革命人民称为“红卫兵年”。这个“人类有史以来的最新型的革命青少年组织”的诞生和他们的革命行动，成为世界上的头等大事之一。世界上一切革命者都对红卫兵表示积极拥护，坚决支持，他们最热烈地欢呼中国的青年革命闯将好得很！有些国家的进步报刊以《红卫兵万岁》为题发表社论和文章，欢庆红卫兵的诞生；出版《红卫兵》专辑，介绍他们的革命事迹。意大利和法国革命青年以《红卫兵》为刊名，出版报纸或杂志，传播革命真理，发扬革命造反精神。许多国家的青年学生纷纷开座谈会，出墙报，表示要向“在毛泽东思想哺育下的一代新人”学习。多少作家写诗赞扬“毛泽东的红小兵”，多少艺术家谱曲歌颂中国“年轻的红色造反者”。各国革命人民都把红卫兵看成是他们的“最亲密的战友”。战斗在反美爱国斗争前线的老挝作家苏万吞满怀激情地写了一首《献给红卫兵战士》的诗，并亲笔将诗用老挝文抄写在一面红绸锦旗上，请中国朋友转送给中国红卫兵。波兰一位普通劳动者把一束他认为是“世界上最美丽的鲜花”，交给一位中国同志，并且激动地说：“请代我把它献给工人阶级的伟大领袖毛泽东，献给那些在毛泽东领导下在文化革命中出现的中国革命青年——红卫兵，献给伟大的文化大革命”。当我国五名留匈学生被匈牙利政府无理勒令回国的时候，一位匈牙利大学生把几本毛主席著作单行本贴心放在怀里，躲过了警察的监视，前往送行。他代表匈牙利革命青年向中国留学生深情地说：“请你们向中国人民和红卫兵转达我们的敬意，告诉他们：我们永远同你们站在一起！”“法属”索马里朋友达汉向中国红卫兵表示：“我们无保留地支持你们敢闯，敢干，敢革命和敢造反的无产阶级革命精神。”
    革命的突击队，帝修的掘墓人
    从世界不同的地区、不同的战斗岗位和工作岗位，都经常有许多革命者写信向“世界革命者的急先锋”——中国红卫兵致贺。象“耸入云霄的高山”的阿尔巴尼亚人民，英勇地斗争在反美前线的越南战士，决心同现代修正主义斗争到底的列宁故乡的青年们，处于新的觉醒中的巴黎公社社员的子孙们，纷纷向中国红卫兵致以战斗的敬礼。西南非洲朋友坎朱指出，“全世界的所有革命人民都向无产阶级文化大革命的年轻的英勇的红卫兵表示敬意”。这是因为，“中国红卫兵是世界上史无前例的革命突击队”。许多国家革命者还指出，红卫兵是红色的巴黎公社社员、十月革命赤卫队和中国红军的无产阶级光荣传统的继承人，是帝国主义和修正主义的掘墓人。日本著名人士宫崎世民赞扬红卫兵是“用毛泽东思想武装起来的，最纯洁、最聪明、最觉悟、最勇敢、最革命的青少年”。缅甸的一位朋友颂扬红卫兵是“有史以来最红、最革命、最无产阶级化的革命接班人”。各国革命者无限敬佩中国红卫兵“立场坚定、旗帜鲜明”，“分清敌我、明辨是非”，“魄力大、勇气足、信心强、气势壮、行动迅速”；敬佩他们“对敌人怀有强烈的仇恨，对人民怀有深厚的感情”。波兰一位朋友表示坚信：世界革命人民“有了毛主席的英明领导，有了红卫兵的革命精神，就无所畏惧”。巴拿马一位诗人在一篇《献给各国人民的光辉旗帜毛泽东同志》的诗中说：
    红卫兵是无产阶级神圣事业保卫者的
    最壮丽的称号。
    谁不知道，
    红卫兵高举红旗，
    转战黄河、长江，
    沿着伟大的导师毛泽东
    指出的胜利道路前进！
    伟大的毛泽东思想的捍卫者
    在中国无产阶级文化大革命的强大的工农兵主力军的坚决支持和密切配合下，中国红卫兵正在“创造历史”，“创造奇迹”，“创造伟大的革命功勋”；红卫兵的革命行动“将永远载入无产阶级领导的阶级斗争史册”。这是世界革命人民对红卫兵的英雄的革命行动的评价。意大利《马克思列宁主义青年》杂志指出：“红卫兵的斗争是中国人民对人类发展的一个最伟大的贡献”。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记卡博称赞红卫兵“为无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，为粉碎右派分子、修正主义分子，为粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义者和以叛徒苏联现领导为中心的现代修正主义者等国内外敌人，为捍卫毛主席的马克思列宁主义路线，为使这条路线取得胜利，而坚定地、勇敢地、顽强地进行着斗争。”法国《新人道报》指出：“中国红卫兵小将们在当代列宁——毛泽东领导下，正在荡涤过去的污泥浊水，消除封建主义、资产阶级和帝国主义的一切遗毒，为中国的巨大跃进开辟了道路。他们的经验和胜利，都将为马克思列宁主义的国际共产主义运动作出贡献。”比利时共产主义青年运动全国执行局在一项决议中说：“忠于老一辈的革命传统和以光荣的人民解放军为榜样的红卫兵，已经成为无产阶级专政的新工具。”
    各国革命人民热烈赞扬中国红卫兵是“在毛主席英明领导下的、无所畏惧地向旧世界冲锋陷阵的百万雄师”，是“大破剥削阶级四旧，大立无产阶级四新的忠实执行者”，是“旧世界的破坏者，新世界的创造者”。一位曾经访问过中国的也门诗人，在北京红卫兵上街横扫“四旧”的头一天，被革命小将们的革命精神深深地感动。当天，他便情不自禁地写了一首歌颂红卫兵的诗：
    “中国的小将们，
    毛泽东的学生们！
    你们捍卫着红色的明天，
    捍卫着光荣的党的事业，
    捍卫着毛泽东中国的伟大东方的工农兵世界！”
    锡兰共产党领导人桑穆加塔桑盛赞，“红卫兵们在几天和几个星期内就实现了在几十年内没有能够做到的事情”，他们象洪流一样，“荡涤着一切同革命相对抗的东西”。
    全世界的革命者最钦佩中国红卫兵“无限忠于和热爱毛主席，忠于马克思列宁主义”。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长巴卢库指出：“红卫兵战士们很好地、准确地执行了毛主席的指示，坚定地沿着毛主席的革命道路前进，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。”许多国家的革命者指出，红卫兵“热情地学习毛泽东思想、贯彻毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想、保卫毛泽东思想”，他们“不愧是伟大的毛泽东思想的捍卫者”，是“宣传毛泽东思想的先锋队”。尼泊尔朋友戈文达指出，红卫兵“是中国人民和世界革命人民的优秀一代，因为他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”。锡兰一位朋友在谈到他访问中国的见闻时说：“我们到处听到红卫兵朗读毛主席语录，唱赞扬伟大领袖毛主席的歌和宣传毛泽东思想。红卫兵表现出对毛主席的无比热爱和革命热情，使人们都受到极大的感染。”坦桑尼亚的许多青年在观看《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》的影片时，见到银幕上出现中国的红卫兵在天安门广场上高声朗读毛主席语录，他们也热情地随着齐声朗读起来。西非一个国家的青年表示要象中国红卫兵一样，随身携带和随时学习革命宝书——《毛主席语录》，并决心为争取祖国的解放而战斗。
    全世界革命人民的希望
    在这场文化大革命烈火的千锤百炼中，中国红卫兵成为“中国人民解放军的强大后备军”，成为“保卫红色中国的万里长城”。全世界的革命者都“为此而感到胜利的喜悦和对中国的未来具有坚强的信心”。澳大利亚《先锋报》指出，红卫兵“正在‘破私立公’”，“把自己改造成为完美的人”。日本的进步朋友称赞，红卫兵“决心在文化大革命的烈火中，把自己锻炼成不怕苦、不怕死，一心一意为革命，全心全意为人民服务”的革命事业的最可靠的接班人。缅甸的一位青年坚信，有了敢闯、敢革命的红卫兵小将，“中国的无产阶级政权将永远成为铁打的江山”。坦桑尼亚的一位朋友说：“红卫兵已向全世界宣告，东方必须保持红色！”西南非洲两位革命者表示坚信：“中国青年听毛主席的教导，按照毛主席的指示办事，以人民解放军为榜样，中国永远不会改变颜色。”有的国家革命者还指出：“中国的红卫兵肯定能把革命接力棒一代一代地传下去，永远高举无产阶级世界革命的旗帜”。
    全世界的革命者把中国红卫兵看作是“世界革命人民的希望”。他们说，中国红卫兵是“推动世界革命的最红的、最革命的生力军”，是“无产阶级国际主义的先锋战士”。乌拉圭文化界人士埃·萨·波尔塔说：“红卫兵不仅是中国革命的闯将，也是世界革命的闯将。”美国一位朋友指出，红卫兵“心中装着中国革命和整个世界革命。他们心中分辨是非的标准，就是毛泽东思想，就是无产阶级的利益，中国革命和世界革命的利益。”阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会的代表指出，“红卫兵正在执行一项具有国际主义的使命”，他们“是反对国际帝国主义的坚强战士，是被压迫人民斗争的坚决支持者”。新加坡《阵线报》指出，红卫兵“已成为资本主义、修正主义不共戴天的死敌和消灭者”，“这怎不叫帝国主义和大小牛鬼蛇神惊惶万状，痛哭流涕，咬牙切齿，悲观失望呢？”
    革命造反精神鼓舞各国青年
    中国红卫兵为世界革命青年“树立了史无前例的光辉榜样”。许多国家的革命者说，“红卫兵的革命精神大大鼓舞了全世界的革命青年”，并且“将永远鼓舞世界上战斗着的青年前进”。许多国家的革命青年表示，
  “要以尊敬的心情学习红卫兵”，并“跟着红卫兵前进”。非洲一个国家的青年表示，“象红卫兵一样永远当革命造反者，决心遵循毛泽东思想永远闹革命。”亚洲一个国家的朋友说：“红卫兵给青年指出了真理的道路。”亚洲另一个国家的朋友说：“我们要走红卫兵的道路，传播红卫兵的敢想、敢干、敢革命的精神。”日本的一位中学生说：“中国红卫兵同我们的年龄相仿，但是他们天不怕，地不怕，正在干着伟大的事业。我们羡慕他们，应当向他们学习。”在现代修正主义集团统治下的苏联的一些革命青年，决心发扬中国红卫兵精神，“举起列宁的革命的火炬”。现在，世界各大洲有些进步青年已以“红卫兵”来命名他们的团体。巴西朋友马尔丁斯说得好：“比起世界上将要出现的亿万个用毛泽东思想武装起来的新型英雄，天空中的星星也会显得为数太少了。这些新型的英雄人物，将象星星一样永远在无产阶级的红色宇宙中闪烁光辉”。
    在中国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，在中国红卫兵和亿万其他革命群众的革命造反精神的鼓舞下，一批敢想、敢说、敢干、敢造反的青年革命闯将定将在世界革命的烈火中涌现出来，一个红色的世界定将在世界革命的大风暴中诞生！
