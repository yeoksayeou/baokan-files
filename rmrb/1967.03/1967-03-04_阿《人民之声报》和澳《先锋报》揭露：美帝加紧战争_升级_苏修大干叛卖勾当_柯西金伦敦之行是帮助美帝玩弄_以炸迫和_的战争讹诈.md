Albanian "People's Voice" and Australian "Vanguard" Expose: U.S. Imperialism Intensifies War "Escalation," Soviet Revisionists Engage in Betrayal and Collusion

Kosygin's London Trip Aids U.S. Imperialism in Playing "Bombing to Force Peace" War Blackmail

	According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tirana dated March 3, the Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on March 3, severely condemning U.S. imperialism's collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership in escalating the war in Vietnam and playing the "peace talks" trick.

	The article said that the recent U.S. aggression and provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are part of the Johnson administration's premeditated aggression plan, aimed at forcing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to surrender and accept "peace under U.S. rule," and abandon support for the anti-U.S. struggle of the people of South Vietnam.

	The article said that the U.S. aggressors' new barbaric crimes, on the one hand, exposed the savagery and madness of the U.S. imperialists, and on the other hand, also exposed the weakness of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam.

	The article pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' plot to deceive and force the Vietnamese people to surrender continues to receive the Soviet revisionist leadership's every possible support and encouragement. The Soviet revisionist rulers, in order to carry out their policy of Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world, are willing to sacrifice the freedom and independence of the Vietnamese people.

	The article revealed that while the U.S. bandits were bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet revisionists were having friendly talks with representatives of the Johnson administration, playing a new trick of "non-proliferation of nuclear weapons." An American exhibition was opened in Moscow, extolling the "welfare" of the American monopoly exploitation system and the war criminals who provide money and guns for the war in Vietnam. The U.S. President recently publicly praised the Soviet revisionist leadership for its "willingness to peacefully resolve the Vietnam problem." All this shows that the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are further collaborating according to a coordinated plan.

	The article said that the U.S. imperialists' escalation of aggression in Vietnam thoroughly exposed their "peace talks" sincerity and thoroughly exposed the imperialist-revisionist trick. The heroic Vietnamese people remain steadfast in the face of U.S. imperialist blackmail and have not been deceived by Johnson's "peace talks" trick.

	The article concluded that the Albanian people are convinced that the U.S. imperialists' despicable "war escalation" will not conquer heroic Vietnam, and the final victory will definitely belong to the Vietnamese people.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Melbourne dated March 2, the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ "Vanguard" published an article on the front page on March 2, emphasizing that the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership encourage U.S. imperialism to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam.

	The article pointed out that in the war of aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. has fallen into a desperate situation. However, the U.S. imperialists fully know that the Soviet revisionists are exerting the greatest pressure to force the Vietnamese people to surrender.

	The article exposed the collusion between Soviet revisionism and U.S. imperialism "on every international issue," especially the Soviet revisionists' help to the U.S. in playing the "bombing to force peace" war blackmail. The article condemned Kosygin's recent trip to London, saying it was "a lowly kowtow to the U.S. bandits." The article asked, "What is this asking for? Is it for the U.S. imperialists to withdraw from Vietnam? Not at all. It is: 'Dear U.S. imperialist aggressors, please, please, please stop bombing, so we can help you achieve the negotiations you so desperately want and need.'"

	The article emphasized that the heroic Vietnamese people's determination to win the anti-U.S. struggle for national liberation and China's resolute support for them make the U.S.-Soviet "peace talks" trick unworkable. No matter how much pressure the Soviet revisionist leaders exert, the Vietnamese people's war has its own logic, and the Vietnamese people will continue to fight.

    阿《人民之声报》和澳《先锋报》揭露：
    美帝加紧战争“升级”苏修大干叛卖勾当
    柯西金伦敦之行是帮助美帝玩弄“以炸迫和”的战争讹诈
    据新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》一日发表编辑部文章，严厉谴责美帝国主义在侵越战争中勾结苏修领导集团，加紧进行“战争升级”和玩弄“和谈”骗局。
    文章说，美国最近对越南民主共和国的侵略和挑衅行动，是约翰逊政府根据预谋的侵略计划进行的，其目的在于强迫越南民主共和国屈服，接受“美国统治下的和平”、放弃对越南南方人民反美斗争的支持。
    文章说，美国侵略者新的野蛮罪行，一方面暴露了美帝国主义者的野蛮和疯狂，另一方面也暴露了美国侵略者在越南的虚弱处境。
    文章指出，美帝国主义者企图欺骗和迫使越南人民屈服的阴谋活动，继续得到苏修领导集团千方百计的支持和鼓励。苏修统治集团为了推行苏美合作主宰世界的霸权政策，不惜牺牲越南人民的自由和独立。
    文章揭露说，正当美国强盗对越南民主共和国进行狂轰滥炸的时候，苏联修正主义者同约翰逊政府的代表进行亲切会谈，玩弄“不扩散核武器”的新阴谋。一个美国展览会在莫斯科开幕，宣扬美国垄断剥削制度的“福利”，宣扬在侵越战争中出钱出枪的战争罪犯。美国总统最近公开赞扬苏修统治集团“愿意和平解决越南问题”。所有这一切都表明，帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派，在根据已经协调好的计划，进一步互相勾结。
    文章说，美帝国主义在越南扩大侵略的行动彻底地揭穿了它的“和谈诚意”，彻底地揭穿了帝修的骗局。英雄的越南人民在美帝国主义的讹诈面前坚定不移，没有为约翰逊的“和谈”阴谋所欺骗。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民确信，美帝国主义者的卑鄙“战争升级”征服不了英雄的越南，最后的胜利一定属于越南人民。
    新华社墨尔本二日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》二日在头版刊载的一篇文章中强调，苏联修正主义领导集团的叛卖行径鼓励美帝国主义者加紧进行侵略越南的战争。
    文章指出，在侵略越南的战争中，美国已陷入绝境。但是，美帝国主义者完全知道，苏联修正主义者正在施行最大的压力来迫使越南人民投降。
    文章揭露苏联修正主义同美帝国主义“在每一个国际问题上合作”，特别是苏修帮助美国玩弄“以炸迫和”的战争讹诈。文章谴责柯西金不久前的伦敦之行说，这是“低声下气向美国强盗屈膝下跪。这是要求什么呢？是要美帝国主义者滚出越南么？根本不是。而是：‘亲爱的美帝国主义侵略者，请，请，请您们停止轰炸，那样我们就可以替您们促成您们那么迫切地希望和需要的谈判。’”
    文章着重指出，英雄越南人民的抗美救国斗争必胜的决心和中国对他们的坚决支持，使美苏“和谈”阴谋无法得逞。不管苏修领导人如何施加压力，而越南人民战争有自己的逻辑，越南人民将继续打下去。
