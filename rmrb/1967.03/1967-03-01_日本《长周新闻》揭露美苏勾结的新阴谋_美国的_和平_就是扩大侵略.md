Japanese *Chūō Shimbun* reporters recently held a discussion titled "The 'Peace' Fraud of the U.S. and the Soviet Union," pointing out that the new "peace" fraud jointly plotted by U.S. imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist ruling clique on the Vietnam issue is aimed at covering up their grand conspiracy to expand the war of aggression.

The reporters attending the discussion said that U.S. imperialism, while playing the "peace" fraud, is expanding military aggression, which is its old trick. Recently, it has been indiscriminately bombing North Vietnam and conducting large-scale operations in South Vietnam. At the same time, it is using Soviet modern revisionism to hasten the plotting of "peace" conspiracies.

The reporters emphasized in the discussion that the "peace" for Vietnam advocated by the revisionists centered on the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is a deception of the people. As long as the U.S. aggressor troops do not completely withdraw from South Vietnam, "this 'peace' can only subject the Vietnamese people to even more cruel oppression, rule, exploitation, and plunder." The so-called "peace" for Vietnam is, in essence, using the cessation of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam as a price to place South Vietnam completely under the rule of U.S. imperialism. This is American-style "peace," a grand conspiracy to sell out the Vietnamese people.

    日本《长周新闻》揭露美苏勾结的新阴谋
    美国的“和平”就是扩大侵略
    新华社东京二十七日电　日本《长周新闻》记者最近以“美苏的‘和平’骗局”为题举行座谈会指出，美帝国主义伙同苏联现代修正主义统治集团在越南问题上共同策划的新的“和平”骗局，是为了掩盖他们扩大侵略战争的大阴谋。
    出席座谈会的记者们说，美帝国主义一面玩弄“和平”骗局，一面扩大军事侵略，这是它一贯的伎俩。它最近对越南北方滥施轰炸，对越南南方进行大规模作战，同时，又利用苏联现代修正主义，加紧策划“和谈”阴谋。
    记者们在座谈会上强调指出，以苏修统治集团为中心的修正主义者所叫嚷的“给越南以和平”，这是对人民的欺骗。美国侵略军队不从越南南方全部撤退出去，“这种‘和平’只能使越南人民遭受到更加残酷的压迫、统治、剥削和掠夺。”所谓的“给越南以和平”，说穿了，就是以美国停止轰炸越南北方为代价，把越南南方完全置于美帝国主义的统治之下。这是美国式的“和平”，是出卖越南人民的大阴谋。
