The Somali government issued a statement on the 21st pointing out that the "referendum" staged by French colonialists on the 19th in the Somali Coast is invalid. The French government must bear responsibility for the consequences of this fraudulent "referendum" that deceives world public opinion.

The statement said that the French colonial authorities used various means to manipulate this "referendum." Since De Gaulle's visit to the Somali Coast last year, a large number of local lawful citizens have been expelled, leaders advocating independence have been arrested, supporters of independence have been persecuted, and freedom of speech has been restricted.

The statement pointed out that the people of the Somali Coast oppose French colonialism and will continue to struggle for independence. The statement said that Somalia firmly supports the nationalists of the Somali Coast. The Somali people advocate the elimination of all forms of colonialism.

After studying the developments in the Somali Coast, the Somali Council of Ministers decided to change the three-day Eid al-Adha (from March 21st to 23rd) into a national day of mourning to commemorate the nationalists of the Somali Coast killed by French colonialism.

Somalia's President Osman canceled his originally scheduled traditional Eid al-Adha reception on the 22nd.

Somalia's acting speaker of the National Assembly, Ahmed Gumani Ruble, published an article calling on people around the world to support the struggle of the Somali Coast people for independence.

The article said that the struggle of the Somali Coast people for freedom and independence is necessary because freedom comes at the cost of blood, and the road to independence is not smooth.

On the 22nd, Somalia's Minister of Information, Yusuf Adam Bukka, issued a statement condemning France's recent "referendum" stunt in the Somali Coast (French Somaliland) and refuting the words of De Gaulle quoted in the French government's statement: "France has not gained material benefits from staying in French Somaliland." Bukka said, "If the French government says it has not gained any benefits from the Somali Coast, then why does it bother to manipulate the recent referendum in its favor? Why doesn't it withdraw?"

According to reports, the people of the Somali Coast, known for their brave struggles, strongly resisted the "referendum" staged by the French government. Starting from the day of the vote (the 19th), the majority of residents in the Somali Coast, despite threats from colonial military and police, engaged in various forms of resistance such as strikes, boycotts, and demonstrations. On the 19th and 20th, French colonialists deployed large numbers of military and police to suppress the protests, killing and injuring many participants and arresting some nationalist leaders.

Faced with the tide of the Somali Coast people's struggle for national independence and against colonial oppression, the French colonial authorities were in a state of panic. The 6,000 colonial troops stationed in the Somali Coast launched a sudden attack, arresting thousands of Africans.

    索政府谴责法国在索马里海岸炮制的“公民投票”
    索马里人民决心消灭一切殖民主义
    索马里海岸人民不顾殖民军警威胁抵制“公民投票”
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：索马里政府二十一日发表声明指出，法国殖民主义者十九日在索马里海岸炮制的“公民投票”是无效的。法国政府必须对这次欺骗世界舆论的假“公民投票”的后果负责。
    声明说，法国殖民当局玩弄种种手法，操纵这次“公民投票”。自从戴高乐去年访问索马里海岸以来，就有大批当地的合法公民被驱逐出境，主张独立的领袖被逮捕，支持独立的人受到迫害，言论自由受到限制。
    声明指出，索马里海岸人民反对法国殖民主义，他们将继续为争取独立而斗争。声明说，索马里坚决支持索马里海岸的民族主义者。索马里人民主张消灭形形色色的殖民主义。
    索马里部长会议在研究了索马里海岸的事态的发展以后，决定把为时三天的古尔邦节（从三月二十一日到二十三日）改为全国哀悼日，悼念被法国殖民主义杀害的索马里海岸的民族主义者。
    索马里共和国总统欧斯曼取消了他原定在二十二日举行的传统的古尔邦节招待会。
    索马里国民议会代理议长艾哈迈德·古马尼·鲁卜勒发表文章，呼吁全世界人民支持索马里海岸人民争取独立的斗争。
    文章说，索马里海岸人民为了争取自由和独立而进行的斗争是必要的，因为要获得自由是要付出血的代价的，走向独立的道路不是一帆风顺的。
    索马里新闻部长优素福·阿丹·布卡二十二日发表声明，谴责法国最近在索马里海岸（法属索马里）导演的“公民投票”骗局，并且驳斥法国政府声明中引用的戴高乐的话：“法国并没有从留在法属索马里得到物质上的好处”。布卡说，既然法国政府说它没有从索马里海岸得到任何利益，那么，“它为什么要去费心操纵最近的公民投票，使之对自己有利？它为什么不撤走呢？”
    据报道，具有英勇斗争传统的索马里海岸人民，强烈地抵制了法国政府导演的“公民投票”。从投票的当天（十九日）开始，索马里海岸的多数居民不顾殖民军警的威胁，进行了罢市、罢课和示威游行等各种反抗斗争。十九、二十日两天，法国殖民主义者出动了大批军警进行镇压，打死打伤不少参加游行的人，并逮捕了一些民族主义者领袖。
    面对索马里海岸人民争取民族独立、反对殖民压迫的怒涛，法国殖民当局惊慌失措。法国驻索马里海岸的六千名殖民部队又发动突然袭击，逮捕了数千名非洲人。
