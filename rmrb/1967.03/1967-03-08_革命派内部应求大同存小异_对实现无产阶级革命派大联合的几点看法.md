The proletarian revolutionaries are implementing the "three-in-one combination," seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This is a sharp and complex class struggle. Revolutionaries must unite to achieve victory in the struggle for power. However, in the process of uniting, many complex internal contradictions arise, and whether revolutionaries can quickly unite depends on how these internal contradictions are handled.

We, the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, have studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" with the problems that have arisen in the current struggle. We have gained immense benefits and have thus relatively successfully achieved the great unity of the revolutionaries in our school.

We deeply feel that to unite, we must correctly distinguish between two types of contradictions and correctly handle contradictions within the revolutionary ranks. Our unity is not a mixture of various political forces; we must prevent class enemies from infiltrating the revolutionary ranks. Our unity is also not a policy of isolationism, advocating "the purer the better." We must "arouse the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants" and "unite hearts and minds" and cannot exclude anyone who can be united. Only in this way can we achieve true unity and seize power from the bottom up.

Some comrades do not hate and fight the power-holders taking the capitalist road deeply enough, but instead focus on the shortcomings of revolutionary comrades, wasting a lot of energy on internal disputes. This is a very dangerous tendency. Chairman Mao said: "Our army has always had two principles: first, be ruthless towards the enemy, crush them, annihilate them; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, with subordinates." These comrades have forgotten Chairman Mao's teachings and lost the big picture. Doing so only makes friends suffer and enemies rejoice. If not corrected, such revolutionaries may turn into their own opposites.

Why does such a tendency exist? Because these comrades underestimate the enemy's strength and do not see the necessity of uniting the revolutionaries in the face of the great enemy. They say: "The power-holders taking the capitalist road have basically been fought down and have become 'dead tigers.' Currently, the contradictions within revolutionary organizations are prominent." This statement is incorrect! The class enemies have not been completely overthrown. At the decisive moment of seizing power, these reactionaries will definitely make desperate struggles. They will stir up trouble, create chaos, and disrupt our lines. Many of the disagreements and obstacles in the great unity are created by them. We must seriously deal with them and never take them lightly or be complacent!

In his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao pointed out: "Before us are two types of social contradictions: those between the enemy and us and those among the people. These are two completely different types of contradictions." In the struggle, we must first clarify who are our friends and who are our enemies and never confuse the two. Some comrades, when emphasizing class struggle, treat many existing contradictions among the people as contradictions between the enemy and us. Conversely, when talking about unity or solidarity, they ignore the fact that many contradictions among the people are also manifestations of the struggle between two classes and two lines, as if contradictions among the people and class struggle have nothing to do with each other, denying the universal existence of class struggle. Both extremes are wrong.

Chairman Mao said: "Draw two lines of demarcation. First, is it revolutionary or counter-revolutionary? Is it Yan'an or Xi'an?" Some people, when dealing with cadres, do not distinguish between proletarian power-holders and those taking the capitalist road; between those implementing the proletarian revolutionary line and those implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. They believe that as long as they are power-holders, they cannot be trusted, and as long as they have made mistakes, they should all be overthrown. This is wrong. Cadres who uphold the revolutionary line are a precious asset of the Party and the people. They will play a huge role in the struggle for power. When revolutionary cadres stand up with the masses to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, revolutionary mass organizations should support them and unite with them in the fight.

Regarding grassroots cadres, we should conduct concrete analysis. Recently, some people, under the banner of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, have not directed their attacks at the formulators and diehard implementers of the reactionary line, but at the majority of grassroots cadres who have been deceived and made some mistakes in their specific work. They have put forward incorrect slogans such as "shelling the grassroots" and "carrying out the two-line struggle at the grassroots level." Chairman Mao teaches us:

"For cadres who have made mistakes, generally speaking, we should adopt the method of persuasion to help them correct their mistakes. Only for those who have made serious mistakes and do not accept guidance should we adopt the method of struggle. Here, patience is necessary; lightly putting the 'opportunist' hat on people and lightly adopting the method of 'carrying out struggle' is wrong." But these comrades like to "settle old scores" and, among comrades, practice the method of "you persecuted me, today I have risen, and I will persecute you," which is wrong. We firmly oppose this!

Within revolutionary organizations and between revolutionary organizations, we advocate active ideological struggle and seek unity through struggle. If there are principled disagreements between various revolutionary organizations and individuals, we must fully use the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big arguments, according to Chairman Mao's teachings: "Clarify right and wrong, do not reconcile or cover up." We must believe that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought will definitely unify the thoughts and actions of the broad revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao said: "All issues of an ideological nature, all issues of disputes among the people, can only be resolved by democratic methods, only by methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved by coercive and subjugating methods." Some people have not acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings. They do not want to do painstaking and detailed ideological work. They cannot stand different opinions, and when they encounter different opinions, they throw "big hats" everywhere. This is not conducive to solving problems.

As for some non-principled disagreements within the revolutionary ranks, we advocate that revolutionary comrades, on the premise of unity in the big direction, should set aside minor differences, seek common ground while reserving differences, and not argue endlessly over trivial issues, so as not to weaken our fighting strength. Some say this is "reconciliation." We say it is "reconciliation" of revolutionaries on the premise of unity in the big direction. What's wrong with that? Some say this is "smoothing things over." Yes! Such "mud" should be "smeared." After smearing, it can eliminate cracks and build our ranks into an extremely strong copper wall and iron wall. What's wrong with that?

We say this does not exclude necessary struggle. For contradictions among the people, struggle is the only way to resolve them. However, this struggle is different from the struggle to resolve contradictions between the enemy and us. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Different types of contradictions can only be resolved by different types of methods." "The two types of contradictions between the enemy and us and among the people have different natures, and the methods of resolution are also different. Simply put, the former is a matter of distinguishing between the enemy and us, and the latter is a matter of distinguishing between right and wrong." We cannot use the methods of struggle against the enemy to handle contradictions among the people. At the same time, in carrying out ideological struggle within the revolutionary ranks, we cannot only see others' faults and not our own; we can only criticize others and touch others' souls but cannot touch the "I" in our own souls. This is not conducive to the great unity of the revolutionaries.

For those who have been deceived and made mistakes, we should also treat them correctly. Currently, more and more people who have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line are awakening, surrendering to the truth, and determined to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is a very favorable condition for the revolutionaries to achieve great unity, a manifestation of the revolutionary ranks growing and developing, and the revolutionary cause flourishing. Revolutionaries should enthusiastically help those who return to the ranks to recognize and correct their mistakes, adopting the policy of "unity-criticism-unity" and "learning from past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." We should allow people to reform, not exclude or discriminate against them, but unite and encourage them.

Of course, those who have been deceived and made mistakes should also have a thorough revolutionary spirit, be brave enough to admit their mistakes, surrender to the truth, and mercilessly criticize their own mistakes, expose the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, and use practical actions to show that they have truly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Revolution knows no order. As long as mistakes are corrected and the correct position is returned to, they are still good comrades.

Currently, an important feature of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is that the revolutionaries unite, implement the "three-in-one combination," seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and at the same time carry out a profound ideological revolution. We must seize power from both the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the "self" in our own minds. Only by seizing the power of the "self" can we more effectively and reliably seize the power of the power-holders taking the capitalist road.

    革命派内部应求大同存小异
    ——对实现无产阶级革命派大联合的几点看法
    北京大学文化革命委员会
    无产阶级革命派正在实行“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，这是一场尖锐复杂的阶级大搏斗。革命派必须大联合，才能取得夺权斗争的胜利。但是，在联合过程中又面临着许多复杂的内部矛盾，革命派能否迅速联合，取决于对这些内部矛盾的处理。
    我们北京大学的广大革命师生带着当前斗争中出现的许多问题，学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，得到了无穷的教益，从而比较圆满地实现了我校革命派的大联合。
    我们深刻地体会到，要联合，就需要正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，就需要正确处理革命队伍内部的矛盾。我们的联合，不是各派政治力量的混合，要防止阶级敌人混进革命队伍；我们的联合，也不是“队伍愈纯愈好”的孤家寡人政策，我们要“唤起工农千百万，同心干”，不能把任何一个可以联合的人拒于门外。这样，我们才能实现真正的大联合，实现自下而上的夺权。
    有些同志对走资本主义道路的当权派，恨得不深，斗得不狠，偏偏揪住革命同志的缺点不放，把大量精力消耗在内部纠纷上。这是十分危险的倾向。毛主席说：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”这些同志忘记了毛主席的教导，迷失了大方向。那样做，只能使亲者痛、仇者快。如不改正，这样的革命者就有可能走向自己的反面。
    为什么会出现这样的倾向呢？因为这些同志低估了敌人的力量，看不到大敌当前，革命派联合起来的必要。他们说：“走资本主义道路当权派基本上斗垮了，都成“死老虎”了，当前，革命组织内部的矛盾就突出了。”这种说法不对！阶级敌人并没有完全被斗倒。在夺权的决战时刻，这些反动的家伙，必定要作疯狂的垂死挣扎，他们煽阴风，点邪火，拉出去，打进来，搅乱我们的阵线，大联合中的许多分歧和障碍，就是他们制造的。我们必须认真对付，切切不可等闲视之，掉以轻心！
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部光辉著作中指出：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”在斗争中，我们必须首先弄清，谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人，决不能随便混淆两者的界限。有些同志一强调阶级斗争，就把大量存在的人民内部矛盾当成敌我矛盾。反过来，一谈到联合或团结，他们又忽视了许多人民内部矛盾也是两个阶级、两种思想斗争的表现，好象人民内部矛盾和阶级斗争毫无关系，否认了阶级斗争的普遍存在。这两个极端，都是错误的。
    毛主席说：“划清两种界限。首先，是革命还是反革命？是延安还是西安？”有些人对待干部，不区分是无产阶级当权派，还是走资本主义道路的当权派；是执行无产阶级革命路线，还是执行资产阶级反动路线，认为只要是当权派，就一概不能信任，只要是犯了错误，就一概打倒，这是不对的。坚持革命路线的领导干部，是党和人民群众的宝贵财富。他们在夺权的斗争中，将起着巨大的作用。当革命的领导干部起来同群众一道，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的时候，革命的群众团体应当支持他们，团结他们一道战斗。
    对待基层干部更应当具体分析。最近，有些人在批判资产阶级反动路线的口号下，不是把矛头指向反动路线的制定者和顽固执行者，而是指向多数是受了蒙蔽而在具体工作中作过某些错事的基层干部，提出“炮轰基层”、“开展基层两条路线斗争”等错误口号。毛主席教导我们：
  “对于犯错误的干部，一般地应采取说服的方法，帮助他们改正错误。只有对犯了严重错误而又不接受指导的人们，才应当采取斗争的方法。在这里，耐心是必要的；轻易地给人们戴上“机会主义”的大帽子，轻易地采用“开展斗争”的方法，是不对的。”而这些同志却喜欢“翻老帐”，在同志之间，实行那种“你整过我，今天我翻身了，就要整你”的做法，是不对的，我们坚决反对！
    在革命组织内部和革命组织之间，我们主张积极的思想斗争，在斗争中求团结。各革命组织和个人之间，如果存在原则分歧，必须充分运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，按照毛主席教导我们的“把是非弄明白，不要调和敷衍。”应当坚信，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是一定能够统一广大革命群众的思想和行动的。毛主席说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”有些人没有按照毛主席的教导去做，他们不愿做艰苦细致的思想工作，他们听不得不同意见，遇有不同意见，就“大帽子”满天飞。这是不利于解决问题的。
    至于革命队伍内部产生的一些非原则分歧，我们主张革命同志在大方向一致的前提下，应当抛开小是小非，求大同，存小异，不要在枝节问题上争论不休，以免削弱自己的战斗力。有人说这是“调和”，我们说是“调”革命派在大方向一致前提下的“和”，有什么不好呢？有人说这是
  “抹稀泥”。是的！这样的“泥”就是要“抹”，抹了后，可以消除裂缝，把我们的队伍筑成无比坚强的铜墙铁壁，这又有什么不好呢？
    我们这样说，并不排斥必要的斗争。对于人民内部矛盾，也只有通过斗争才能得到解决。但是，这种斗争，不同于解决敌我矛盾的斗争。正如毛主席指出的：“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。简单地说起来，前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。”我们不能用对敌斗争的方法来处理人民内部矛盾。同时，在革命派内部开展思想斗争，不能只看见别人黑，看不到自己黑；只能批评别人，触及别人的灵魂，不能触及自己灵魂中的“我”字，这是不利于革命派大联合的。
    对于那些受蒙蔽、犯过错误的同志，也应当正确对待。目前，受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的人，越来越多地觉悟过来，向真理投降，决心站到毛主席的革命路线一边。这是革命派实现大联合非常有利的条件，是革命队伍壮大发展、革命事业日益兴旺的表现。革命派对归队的同志，应当满腔热忱地帮助他们认识错误、改正错误，要采取“团结——批评——团结”、“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针。要允许人家改过，不是排斥歧视，而是团结鼓励。
    当然，受了蒙蔽、犯过错误的同志，也要有彻底革命的精神，勇于承认错误，向真理投降，毫不留情地批判自己的错误，揭发资产阶级反动路线的罪行，用实际行动表明自己是真正站到了毛主席的革命路线一边。革命不分先后。只要改正了错误，回到正确立场上来，那还是好同志。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要特点就是革命派联合起来，实行“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，同时进行深刻的思想革命。既夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，又夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，只有夺“私”字的权，才能更有效、更可靠地夺走资本主义道路当权派的权。
