The U.S. aggressors are shouting loudly about increasing their troops in South Vietnam to five hundred thousand. However, despite their continuous reinforcement of troops in South Vietnam, they face an insurmountable difficulty: low morale. Many American soldiers sent to the South Vietnamese battlefield as cannon fodder are increasingly feeling that this is a hopeless and unjust war. Their war weariness and anti-war sentiments are very strong and have developed into open refusal to fight. According to incomplete statistics, since the large-scale U.S. invasion of South Vietnam in March 1965, there have been more than fifty instances of resistance to war, with thousands of American soldiers throwing down their weapons and refusing to fight. This is rare in the history of U.S. aggression.

The following are some examples of refusal to fight among U.S. troops in South Vietnam.

Last May, the First Infantry Platoon under the Third Brigade of U.S. forces stationed in Lai Thu refused to go to the "sweeping" operation in the Ninh Thuan Province of South Vietnam, resulting in more than thirty American soldiers being imprisoned. Another infantry platoon under the same brigade also refused to go to Ninh Thuan for combat, killing seven American officers who tried to persuade them to obey orders.

A squad of U.S. invading forces stationed in Vung Tau once opposed the higher-ups' order to reinforce the "sweeping" operation of the Phu Loi forces, and one American soldier even set himself on fire to express his opposition to the war.

In the middle of last year, after the South Vietnamese people's armed forces attacked the U.S. Phu Loi airbase, two American soldiers guarding the base handed over their guns to the commander and requested to be sent back to the United States.

A platoon under the First Infantry Division once had all its infantry soldiers refuse to carry out an attack order. As a result, one American officer was dismissed, and three infantrymen were executed.

Many American soldiers, although they did not directly and openly refuse to fight, also expressed their dislike and opposition to this aggressive war in various ways. According to the Vietnam Democratic Republic's publication "Vietnam Newsletter": When the South Vietnamese guerrillas distributed propaganda leaflets to the U.S. military base, many American soldiers who picked up the leaflets often wrote "OK" or "Agree" on them. Some American soldiers even wrote on the leaflets: "Thank you for helping us see the truth. We will do anything to get out of this war," and then left it on the battlefield.

    从厌战、反战到拒战
    美国侵略者正在大喊大叫，要把侵越美军增加到五十万。但是尽管他们源源增兵南越，他们却碰到一个不可克服的困难：士气不振。许多被送到南越战场充当炮灰的美国士兵越来越感到这是一场没有出路的不义之战。他们厌战、反战的情绪十分强烈，并且发展到公开的拒战。据不完全统计，从一九六五年三月美国侵略军大规模侵入南越以来，已经发生了五十多起抗拒战争的行动，有数千美国士兵扔下武器拒绝作战。这在美国侵略史上是少有的。
    下面是一些在侵越美军中发生的拒战事例。
    去年五月，美国驻在莱溪的第三旅属下的第一步兵小队，因为拒绝去南越西宁省“扫荡”，有三十多名美军因此被判入狱。同属一旅的一步兵小队，也因拒绝去西宁作战，曾杀死了七名企图说服他们服从命令的美国官兵。
    驻在永泰的美国侵略军一分队曾经反对上级要他们去增援“扫荡”福翎部队的命令，其中有一美国士兵还引火自焚，以表示反对这场战争。
    去年年中，在南越人民武装袭击了美国富利机场后，有两名驻守机场的美国士兵把枪交还司令官，要求将他们送回美国去。
    美军第一步兵师属下一个队曾发生全体步兵抗拒执行一次出击的命令的事件。结果，这队美国侵略军的一名军官被撤职，三名步兵被枪毙。
    许多美国士兵虽然没有直接公开的拒战，但他们也用各种方式表现他们对这场侵略战争的厌恶和反对。据越南民主共和国出版的《越南信使》报道：当南越游击队向美军驻地散发宣传传单时，很多美国士兵拾到传单，就往往写上“OK”或“同意”的字样。有的美国士兵还在传单上写着：“多谢你们帮助我们看到真理。我们将去做任何事情，以便使我们摆脱这场战争”，然后把它留在战场上。
