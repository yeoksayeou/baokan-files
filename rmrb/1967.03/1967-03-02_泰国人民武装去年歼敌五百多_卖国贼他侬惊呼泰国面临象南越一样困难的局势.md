According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, a broadcast from the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on the 21st of last month, titled "Expand Armed Struggle, Use People's War to Annihilate American Aggressors and the Thanom-Baibo Clique," celebrated the rapid development and growth of the armed struggle of the Thai people.

The article stated that in 1966, the Thai people's armed forces engaged in over 150 battles with American imperialism and the Thanom-Baibo clique, killing and wounding more than 520 enemies. Among them were nearly 40 American aggressors and military officers of the Thanom-Baibo clique at the rank of colonel or below.

The article pointed out that the U.S.-Thai reactionary clique is now surrounded by the Thai people. Currently, people in 19 provinces in the northeastern and southern regions have taken up arms to fight against the enemy.

The article pointed out that through long-term struggle, the Thai people have come to understand that to fight against the armed reactionary ruling class, the people must have their own armed forces to defeat the enemy; otherwise, they will be slaughtered at will. "Therefore, the people's struggle can only seize power through armed struggle."

The article called on the Thai people to unite more closely, further organize armed forces, expand armed struggle, and use people's war to annihilate American imperialist aggressors and the Thanom-Baobo traitor clique.

According to a report from our newspaper, from January 23 to February 5 this year, in a span of half a month, the people's armed forces in northeastern Thailand launched nearly 20 attacks on the Thanom clique's government troops and occupied villages to conduct anti-American and patriotic propaganda among the people.

The development and growth of the Thai people's armed struggle have made American imperialism and the Thai reactionaries extremely frightened. The Thai puppet prime minister Thanom recently lamented: "The Thai people's armed anti-American patriotic struggle has 'spread throughout the regions,' and the difficulties faced by the Thanom-Baibo clique in dealing with the people's armed forces are similar to the situation in South Vietnam." He admitted: "Even with a powerful security force, it is very difficult to completely suppress the communists (referring to the patriotic armed forces)."

In order to prevent Thailand from becoming a second South Vietnam, American imperialism not only provides money and weapons to assist the Thanom clique but also personally intervenes to suppress the Thai people's patriotic struggle.

The United States allocated $43 million in so-called "aid" to the Thai puppet government in the 1966 fiscal year, of which 85% was used to suppress the Thai people's armed struggle.

American invasion troops also directly participated in the war to suppress the Thai patriotic armed forces. American helicopters frequently transported Thai puppet soldiers to "encircle and suppress" the patriotic armed forces. The American news agency admitted that there is a special forces unit of several hundred people stationed in Thailand, "helping to carry out anti-rebellion tasks" (referring to suppressing the Thai patriotic armed forces). In the Thai puppet army, Americans have sent many "advisors," "down to the battalion level in infantry and to the company level in artillery." "American troops are expected to further penetrate deeper into the northeastern region."

    泰国人民武装去年歼敌五百多
    卖国贼他侬惊呼泰国面临象南越一样困难的局势
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台二十一日以《扩大武装斗争，用人民战争消灭美国侵略者、他侬—巴博集团》为题广播一篇文章，欢呼泰国人民武装斗争正以燎原之势迅速发展壮大。
    文章说，据统计，在一九六六年一年里，泰国人民武装同美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团进行了一百五十多次战斗，打死打伤敌人五百二十多名。其中包括美国侵略者和他侬—巴博集团校级以下军官近四十人。
    文章指出，美、泰反动集团已处在泰国人民的包围之中，目前拿起武器来同敌人进行斗争的已经有东北部和南部的十九个府。
    文章指出，泰国人民在长期斗争的经验中认识到，同武装到牙齿的反动统治阶级进行斗争，如果人民没有自己的武装力量，就无法战胜敌人，而只有任人宰割，“因此人民的斗争，只能以武装斗争去夺取政权。”
    文章号召泰国人民更加紧密地团结起来，进一步组织武装队伍，扩大武装斗争，用人民战争去消灭美帝国主义侵略者和他侬—巴博卖国集团。
    本报讯　今年一月二十三日到二月五日半个月中，泰国东北部人民武装对他侬集团政府军发动了近二十次进攻，并占领村庄向人民进行抗美爱国宣传。
    泰国人民武装斗争的发展和壮大，使美帝国主义和泰国反动派十分惊恐。泰国傀儡总理他侬最近曾连续哀叹：泰国人民武装抗美爱国斗争已“布满各部域”，他侬—巴博集团在对付人民武装方面的“困难也好比南越情况一样”。他承认：“即使有强大的治安部队，也很难把共产党（指爱国武装）完全镇压下去”。
    为了防止泰国成为第二个南越，美帝国主义不仅出钱出枪帮助他侬集团，而且亲自插手镇压泰国人民爱国斗争。
    美国在一九六六财政年度拨给泰国傀儡政府的所谓“援助”达到四千三百万美元。其中百分之八十五是用来镇压泰国爱国武装斗争的。
    美国侵略军还直接参与了镇压泰国爱国武装的战争。美国的直升飞机经常运送泰国傀儡军去“围剿”爱国武装。美国通讯社承认，美国有一支数百人的“特种部队”驻在泰国，“帮助执行反叛乱任务”（指镇压泰国爱国武装）。在泰国傀儡军里美国派了许多“顾问”，“在步兵中派到团一级，在炮兵里派到营一级”。“美国部队预料将在更加深入东北部的地方”。
