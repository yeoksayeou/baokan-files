Seven African nationalist organizations issued a joint statement here on the 17th, strongly condemning the illegal convening of the so-called Eighth Session of the Asian-African Solidarity Council by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. They also condemned the collusion between the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The seven organizations are the Bechuanaland People's Party, the Basutoland Congress Party, the Azanian Pan-Africanist Congress, the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, the Swaziland Progressive Party, the South West Africa People's Organization, and a nationalist organization from Angola.

In a statement read by Bobbi Marks on behalf of the seven organizations at a gathering of Asian and African people to commemorate "Zimbabwe Day," it was pointed out that the Azanian Pan-Africanist Congress, the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, and the Zimbabwe African National Union were prevented from participating in the Nikosia meeting controlled by the Soviet revisionists. This was not accidental. The Soviet revisionists even stooped to the level of illegally and barbarically expelling member organizations from Japan, Ceylon, Malaya, Senegal, Rwanda, the South West Africa People's Organization, and many other Asian and African people's solidarity organizations.

The statement further said: "In fact, this did not come as a surprise to the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa, because the Soviet revisionists usually act in collusion with U.S. imperialism, playing the role of an international fire brigade to extinguish the revolutionary flames in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and even the world."

The statement emphasized: "The Asian-African conference to be held in Beijing this year will restore the legal status of the Zimbabwe African National Union in the Asian-African movement."

The Azanian (South Africa) Pan-Africanist Congress's organ, "Africanist News and Views," published in Cairo, issued an article in its March issue condemning the recent illegal convening of the split "Eighth Session of the Asian-African Solidarity Council" by the Soviet modern revisionists in Nikosia. It also expressed support for the resolution passed at the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Winneba to hold the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year.

The publication pointed out: "The event of convening this council in Nikosia undoubtedly proves that the Soviet modern revisionists are the biggest splitters and the number one accomplices of imperialism. The Soviet revisionists have formulated a strategy and tactics aimed at turning the Asian-African solidarity organizations into an international and intercontinental peace council, which would be beneficial for them to suppress the revolutionary spirit of the oppressed peoples and extinguish the revolutionary flames."

The publication also pointed out that at the illegal Nikosia meeting, the uncompromising and unyielding revolutionary leaders of independent nationalist organizations did not succumb to the threats of great-power chauvinism and withdrew from the meeting, immediately dealing a heavy blow to the modern revisionists. They achieved victory in their relentless struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and its accomplices, the modern revisionists.

The publication said: "We Azanians have every reason to take decisive action against the modern revisionists because they have caused great harm to the political struggle of our people."

The publication emphasized: "All revolutionaries and people with a sense of justice around the world should condemn the Nikosia meeting. At the same time, they should insist on the decision of the Winneba Conference, that is, the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference should be held in Beijing."

The executive committee of the Burma Asian-African Solidarity Committee held a meeting here on the 17th and passed a resolution supporting and welcoming the holding of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year.

The resolution reaffirmed that the Burma Asian-African Solidarity Committee supports the resolution of the 1965 Winneba Conference to hold the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing in 1967.

The Burma Asian-African Solidarity Committee announced that the resolutions passed at the illegal Eighth Session of the Asian-African Solidarity Council held in Nikosia under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists are invalid.

    七个非洲民族主义组织发表联合声明
    谴责苏修同美帝勾结镇压亚非拉革命斗争
    缅甸亚非团结委员会支持今年在北京召开第五届亚非团结大会
    新华社开罗十七日电  七个非洲民族主义组织十七日在这里发表联合声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团强行非法召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议，并谴责美苏勾结镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争。
    这七个组织是贝专纳人民党、巴苏陀兰大会党、阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会、莫三鼻给革命委员会、斯威士兰进步党、西南非洲民族联盟和安哥拉的一个民族主义组织。
    由波比·马克代表七个组织在亚非人士纪念“津巴布韦日”集会上宣读的联合声明指出，阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会、莫三鼻给革命委员会，以及津巴布韦非洲民族联盟被阻挠参加苏修控制的这次尼科西亚会议，这决不是偶然的。苏修甚至堕落到非法和野蛮地开除来自日本、锡兰、马来亚、塞内加尔、卢旺达、西南非洲民族联盟和其他许多亚非人民团结组织的成员组织。
    声明接着说：“事实上，这并没有使亚非的革命人民感到奇怪，因为苏修通常总是同美帝联合行动，充当国际消防队来扑灭亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲甚至全世界的革命烈火。”
    声明强调指出：“今年在北京正当地召开的亚非会议将恢复津巴布韦非洲民族联盟在亚非运动中的合法地位。”
    新华社开罗电　在这里出版的阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会机关刊物《非洲主义者新闻和观点》三月号发表文章，谴责苏联现代修正主义者前不久在尼科西亚非法召开分裂的“第八届亚非团结理事会”，并表示支持温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会通过的关于今年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议。
    这家刊物指出：“在尼科西亚召开这个理事会的事件，无可置疑地证明：苏联现代修正主义者是最大的分裂主义者，是为帝国主义效劳的头号帮凶。苏修制定了一种战略和策略，妄图把亚非人民团结组织变成一个国际性的、洲际性的和平理事会，以利于他们压制被压迫人民的革命精神和扑灭革命的烈火。”
    这家刊物还指出，在非法的尼科西亚会议上，不妥协的、不投降的革命者所领导的、独立的民族主义组织，没有屈服于大国沙文主义的威胁，退出了会场，当场给予现代修正主义者以重大的打击。他们在反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其帮凶现代修正主义者的无情斗争中，取得了胜利。
    刊物说：“我们阿扎尼亚人有理由对现代修正主义者采取坚决的行动，因为它给我国人民的政治斗争造成了很大的损害。”
    这家刊物强调指出：“全世界一切革命者和有正义感的人们应当谴责尼科西亚会议，他们同时应当坚持温尼巴大会的决定，即第五届亚非人民团结大会在北京举行。”
    新华社仰光十八日电缅甸亚非团结委员会执行委员会十七日在这里举行的会议上通过决议，支持和欢迎今年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    决议重申，缅甸亚非团结委员会拥护一九六五年温尼巴大会关于一九六七年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议。
    缅甸亚非团结委员会宣布，在苏联修正主义者操纵下，在尼科西亚举行的非法的第八届亚非团结理事会会议上作出的决议是无效的。
