	Indonesian right-wing forces have announced the stripping of Sukarno of all his powers. The U.S. imperialist's faithful lackey, Suharto, has been appointed as "acting president."

	New York, March 13 — From Jakarta: The puppet of the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique, the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, passed a resolution on the 12th, announcing the "revocation of the mandate given to President Sukarno by the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, and the revocation of all state administrative powers granted to him by the 1945 Constitution." This resolution also "appointed" Suharto as "acting president." That same day, a ceremony was held for Suharto to "take the oath of office."

	This resolution is a further action taken by the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique after they coerced Sukarno to "transfer" his last remaining "presidential powers" to Suharto on February 22 this year. This is to legalize their illegal actions of completely stripping Sukarno of his powers.

	The resolution also announced a "ban on Sukarno's political activities until the general election." It further stated that legal issues involving Sukarno would be handled by Suharto. This decision by the Indonesian right-wing military clique once again exposed their fascist nature.

### 印尼右派宣布剥夺苏加诺一切权力  美帝忠实走狗苏哈托充任“代理总统”

    印尼右派宣布剥夺苏加诺一切权力
    美帝忠实走狗苏哈托充任“代理总统”
    新华社十三日讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义在印度尼西亚的走狗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团的御用工具——临时人民协商会议，十二日通过决定，宣布“撤销临时人民协商会议授予苏加诺总统的委任状，撤销一九四五年宪法所规定（授予他）的一切国家行政权力”。这项决定还“任命”苏哈托为“代理总统”。当天，举行了苏哈托“宣誓就职”仪式。
    这个决定是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团继今年二月二十二日逼迫苏加诺把他最后一点装潢门面的“总统职权”“移交”给苏哈托以后，而进一步采取的行动，以便把印尼右派军人集团彻底剥夺苏加诺的权力的非法行动“合法化”。
    这项决定并宣布“禁止苏加诺总统进行政治活动，直到普选时为止。”决定还宣布把涉及苏加诺的“法律问题”交由苏哈托执行。印尼右派军人集团的这一决定再一次暴露了它的法西斯主义的狰狞面目。
