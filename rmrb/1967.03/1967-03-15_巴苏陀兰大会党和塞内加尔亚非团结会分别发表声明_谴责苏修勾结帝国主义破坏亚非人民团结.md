	Botswana Democratic Party and Senegal African Unity Association Issue Statements
	Condemn Soviet Revisionists' Collusion with Imperialism to Sabotage Asian-African Unity
	Support the Fifth Asian-African Solidarity Conference to Be Held in Beijing

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in London, on March 7, the representative of the Botswana Democratic Party in London, Morapo, issued a statement strongly condemning the recent illegal "Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council" meeting held in Nicosia, Cyprus, under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionist leadership. The statement said that the so-called resolutions passed at this meeting are illegal and divisive.

	The statement said: "The Botswana Democratic Party solemnly declares that it supports and unconditionally adheres to the resolution unanimously adopted at the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Accra, Ghana, to hold the Fifth Conference in Beijing in 1967."

	The statement pointed out that the subversive activities at the Nicosia meeting were carried out at the instigation of some counter-revolutionary saboteurs within the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization at the behest of U.S. imperialism. The statement said, "This is exactly what Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: 'In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will always make a last struggle against the revolutionary forces.'"

	The statement said that the Nicosia split meeting brazenly passed a batch of illegal and divisive so-called resolutions. It pointed out that the plot to change the venue of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference from Beijing to Algeria was hastily pushed through in a rush, with some people clamoring for it in advance for this purpose. It said: "This is obviously unacceptable and therefore illegal."

	The statement emphasized, "Any attempt to cancel the resolution unanimously adopted at the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference will only backfire on the revisionist splitters themselves."

	According to a report from the New China News Agency, on February 16, the Senegal African Unity Committee issued a statement in Dakar, the capital of Senegal.

	The statement pointed out, "This illegal action taken under the instigation of the revisionists can only harm the unity of our organization, thereby undermining the struggle of the Asian-African peoples and serving imperialism."

	The statement emphasized, "Our committee therefore declares: The conspiracy in Nicosia once again proves that revisionism and imperialism have formed an alliance to sabotage our anti-imperialist united front."

	The statement said, "Our committee reaffirms its position: fully supporting the Accra Conference's resolution on holding the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing in 1967." It said that the resolution of the Fourth Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference in Accra is a "legally adopted resolution," and the so-called Eighth Asian-African Solidarity Council meeting held recently in Nicosia "has no right to amend the resolution unanimously adopted by the conference."

	The statement concluded, "Our committee calls on all anti-imperialist member organizations of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization to resolutely adhere to this resolution and reject the divisive activities of the revisionists who act as the imperialists' allies."

    巴苏陀兰大会党和塞内加尔亚非团结会分别发表声明
    谴责苏修勾结帝国主义破坏亚非人民团结
    支持在北京召开第五届亚非团结大会
    据新华社伦敦电　巴苏陀兰大会党驻伦敦代表莫拉波七日在这里发表声明，强烈谴责最近在苏联修正主义领导集团操纵下在塞浦路斯尼科西亚非法召开的“第八届亚非团结理事会”所通过的非法和分裂的所谓决定。
    声明说：“巴苏陀兰大会党庄严宣告，它拥护和无条件地遵守在加纳温尼巴举行的第四届亚非人民团结大会一致通过的关于一九六七年在北京举行第五届大会的决议”。
    声明指出，尼科西亚会议上的颠覆活动是美帝国主义在亚非人民团结组织内的一些反革命别动队唆使下进行的。声明说，这正是毛泽东主席所指出的：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。
    声明说，尼科西亚分裂会议悍然通过了一批非法和分裂的所谓决定。它指出，要把第五届亚非人民团结大会的会址从北京改到阿尔及利亚的阴谋，是在事先为这一目的而拉拢一些人吵吵嚷嚷地叫好的情况下匆匆强行通过的。它说：“这显然是不能容许的，因此也是非法的”。
    声明强调指出，“任何要取消第四届亚非人民团结大会一致通过的决议的破坏行动，只会使修正主义分裂主义者自己倒霉。”
    据新华社讯　达喀尔消息：塞内加尔亚非团结委员会二月十六日在塞内加尔首都达喀尔发表声明。
    声明指出，“在修正主义者唆使下采取的这种非法的行动，只能损害我们的组织的团结，从而破坏亚非人民的斗争并为帝国主义效劳。”
    声明强调说，“我们的委员会因此声明：尼科西亚（会议）的阴谋再一次证明修正主义和帝国主义结成联盟以破坏我们的反帝斗争统一战线。”
    声明说，“我们的委员会重申自己的立场：完全支持温尼巴（大会）关于一九六七年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议。”它说，温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会的决议是“合法作出的决议”，最近在尼科西亚召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议“无权篡改大会一致通过的决议”。
    声明最后说，“我们的委员会呼吁亚非人民团结组织的所有反帝成员组织坚决遵守这一决议，并拒绝参与充当帝国主义者的同盟军的修正主义者的分裂活动。”
