The news of Comrade Guo Jiaming's glorious sacrifice for the revolution reached the Sericulture Section of Xiangshan Horticultural Farm in Zhenjiang City, and the revolutionary masses of the section were all deeply saddened. They reminisced about the heroic deeds of the martyr in his lifetime, and with tears in their eyes, they told people about the vivid stories of Guo Jiaming's daily life, which shone with the brilliance of communist thought.

We Have Chairman Mao to Support Us!

It was one evening in July of last year, nearly eleven o'clock at night. Guo Jiaming, who had been unjustly detained by the Zhenjiang City Committee work team and labeled as an "anti-party element" and a "monster," was bent over his desk, engrossed in reading the works of Chairman Mao.

Ever since Guo Jiaming was detained, the work team had not allowed him to read books or newspapers. After Guo Jiaming repeatedly requested them, they finally brought him his own four-volume "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Guo Jiaming happily told others, "How can I part with Mao Zedong Thought! Without Mao Zedong Thought, I have nothing! Now that Chairman Mao's books are by my side, I am not afraid of anything!"

Guo Jiaming was deeply engrossed in reading the brilliant works of the great leader Chairman Mao, "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and thinking about the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the section. He deepened his understanding of this sharp and complex class struggle from Chairman Mao's teachings and drew boundless strength from it.

In October of last year, his elder brother Guo Jiacheng and younger sister Jiarong came to visit him. His brother said to him, "You must stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, insist on what is right, and correct what is wrong." His sister chose a plaque with the words "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice" and gave it to him, encouraging him to persist in the struggle. Guo Jiaming pinned the plaque neatly on his chest, held his head high, stood tall, and his eyes shone with a firm and victorious belief.

In those days when the sky was temporarily dark, Guo Jiaming carefully read through the four volumes of Chairman Mao's works, arming himself with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Sometimes, he would open the book and gaze at the photo of his beloved leader Mao, forgetting the various torments he had endured, and could not help but smile with confidence. He wrote in his indictment, "You capitalist masters, do not rejoice too early! Do not think that by labeling me as a 'counter-revolutionary' and an 'anti-party element,' I will not dare to rebel against you. No! With Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee supporting us, victory is ours!"

A Red Heart Cannot Be Contained

Guo Jiaming had been "detained" by the work team for nearly three months. However, detention could only restrict his movements but could not contain his selfless red heart.

One day, Guo Jiaming was sitting in the small room where he was detained, studying Chairman Mao's works, when he suddenly heard someone outside shouting, "The silkworm house is on fire!" "The wires are live! Quick, turn off the power!"

Guo Jiaming looked out the window and saw flames and smoke coming from the opposite silkworm house. It was around four o'clock in the afternoon, and the male comrades were all working in the fields. Only a few female students from the agricultural school were taking care of the silkworm house. The silkworm house was full of flammable materials like reed curtains and bamboo; in row after row of silkworm trays, the autumn silkworms were climbing up to spin their cocoons. If the fire started, state property would suffer serious losses.

The selfless warrior Guo Jiaming could not bear to see the people's property being damaged! He forgot that he was a "detained" person and immediately rushed out of the small room where he was detained, grabbed a bamboo pole, and rushed to the east side of the silkworm house. He forcefully cut the power fuse in the corner of the house, and then followed everyone into the silkworm house to put out the fire. Because the power was cut off, the rescue was timely, and finally, no disaster occurred.

Who would have thought that this incident was later maliciously labeled by the work team, which was implementing the capitalist reactionary line, as "Guo Jiaming trying to escape" and "trying to commit suicide," and he was struggled against in a meeting. Guo Jiaming just smiled coldly at them.

"How can sparrows understand the aspirations of a swan!" Those capitalist masters, how could they understand the revolutionary spirit of a proletarian revolutionary warrior who is dedicated to the public good!

Who Should Take That Field?

Only those who are selfless can have a broad vision and think of the whole.

One afternoon in February last year, the team leader Guo Jiaming went to the section to discuss the allocation of fields. At that time, the Sericulture Section, in order to facilitate production management, divided the newly reclaimed reed marsh wasteland into two parts, east and west. The field on the west side of the river had poor soil, low terrain, and was overgrown with weeds, requiring more effort to manage.

Who should take that field? Guo Jiaming did not hesitate and voluntarily took the western field, and also expressed to the section that he would definitely manage this field well.

Back in the team, many comrades complained that he was a "fool." In the evening, Guo Jiaming studied Chairman Mao's works "On the Chongqing Negotiations" with everyone, discussing the issue. He said, "At that time, I also had inner struggles. However, Chairman Mao taught us: 'We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do.' We should let go of convenience and take on heavy burdens. If we can achieve good results under unfavorable conditions, that is true glory. First, think of your own small collective, how can we build our country and our farm well in that way?!" These words made the comrades who had complaints feel their hearts lighten. Then, everyone studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and unanimously expressed: "We must 'resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory'!"

Selflessness leads to fearlessness. In the hot summer, Guo Jiaming, bare-chested, fought alongside everyone against the newly reclaimed wasteland, tenaciously struggling against the drought, tanning his body black. Now, the barren land has been transformed into fertile fields, and Guo Jiaming's communist spirit is deeply imprinted in everyone's heart.

Revolution in the Depths of the Soul

Last May, Guo Jiaming was transferred from the first team to the agricultural school run by the section to assist in the work. The comrades from the first team were reluctant to part with him, and the students of the agricultural school also welcomed him warmly. Many students affectionately called him "Teacher Guo," and some even called him "Director" or "Principal." Although Guo Jiaming did not want the students to address him in this way, he still felt a kind of indescribable joy in his heart.

He immediately realized that this was a manifestation of individualism, and he could not let it pass! In the evening, he studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind and conducted a profound self-examination of his thoughts. He wrote in his diary: "Many heroes and advanced individuals, whenever they achieve success, always undergo one criticism and self-examination; when they are promoted by the leadership, they first think of the heavier revolutionary responsibility, and work even harder. But my thoughts are completely different, this is a bourgeois view of fame and profit, a manifestation of selfish thoughts in my mind, which should be seriously overcome. I realize that only by overcoming individualism and vanity can I continue to advance. Chairman Mao said: 'There are many things, if we fall into blindness and lack self-awareness, they can become our burden, our burden.' I must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, put down my burden, and move forward lightly."

Guo Jiaming often seized the fleeting selfish thoughts in his mind, carried out a revolution in the depths of his soul, constantly broke away from selfishness and established public-mindedness, and promoted his own ideological transformation.

Taking Responsibility to the People

Last May, a few young people from the first team planned to compile the family history of a young worker into a play, using cultural and entertainment forms to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and refute the shameless rumors of anti-party and anti-socialist elements like Deng Tuo. Guo Jiaming, who had been transferred to work at the agricultural school, heard the news and immediately crossed the hill to the first team, expressing strong support. He said, "This play must be performed well, it can educate the masses and educate ourselves." He also specifically helped them revise the script, highlighting the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses. Little did he know that this matter was unreasonably obstructed by the bourgeois masters of the section. A few young people hesitated. Guo Jiaming encouraged them, saying, "We are propagating the great Mao Zedong Thought and should persist!" He also said firmly, "We propagate Mao Zedong Thought and do not need those bad guys' approval!" That night, they began rehearsing again, full of joy, and Guo Jiaming was also among them, singing and laughing.

The bourgeois masters of the section regarded Guo Jiaming as a thorn in their side and often named him in big and small meetings, and used the "rightist" hat to suppress him. Well-meaning comrades advised Guo Jiaming not to "offend" others in the future to avoid retaliation. Guo Jiaming seriously replied, "Chairman Mao taught us: 'Our responsibility is to the people.' Whoever has shortcomings and mistakes should be pointed out without mercy, and there should be no selfish thoughts. Someone uses the 'rightist' hat to pressure me, but I am not afraid. As long as I am responsible to the Party and the people, it does not matter if I suffer a temporary injustice."

    无私的战士心最红
    ——无产阶级革命战士郭嘉宏的故事
    郭嘉宏同志为革命光荣牺牲的消息传到镇江市象山园艺场蚕桑工区，工区的革命群众无不感到悲痛。他们缅怀烈士生前的英雄事迹，含着热泪向人们讲述了郭嘉宏同志平时那些闪烁着共产主义思想光辉的生动故事。
    有毛主席给我们撑腰！
    那是去年七月的一天晚上，将近半夜十一点了，被镇江市委工作组打成“反党分子”、“牛鬼蛇神”的郭嘉宏，正俯首灯下，苦读毛主席著作。
    自从郭嘉宏被无理拘禁以来，工作组一直不让他读书看报。经过郭嘉宏一再强烈要求，才拿来了他自己的四卷《毛泽东选集》。郭嘉宏高兴地对别人说：“我怎么能够离开毛泽东思想！没有毛泽东思想，就没有我的一切！现在有毛主席的书在我身边，我什么也不怕！”
    郭嘉宏全神贯注地阅读着伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》，思考着工区文化大革命运动的情况。他从毛主席的教导中，更加深了对这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的理解，也汲取了无穷无尽的力量。
    去年十月间，他的哥哥郭嘉承和妹妹嘉荣先后来探望他。哥哥对他说：“你要坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，对的要坚持，错的要改正。”妹妹挑选了一个嵌有“下定决心，不怕牺牲”八个金字的毛主席语录牌送给他，鼓舞他坚持斗争。郭嘉宏把语录牌端正地别在胸前，高昂着头，挺起了胸，眼睛里闪射出坚定的充满着胜利信念的光芒。
    在那暂时乌云蔽天的日子里，郭嘉宏把四卷毛主席著作认真地通读了一遍，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己。有时，他翻开宝书注视着敬爱的领袖毛主席的相片，忘掉了受到的种种折磨，不禁满怀信心地笑了起来。他在控诉书里写道：“资产阶级老爷们，你们不要高兴得太早了！你们不要以为给我扣上‘反革命’‘反党分子’的帽子，我就不敢造你们的反。不！有毛主席和党中央给我们撑腰，胜利是属于我们的！”
    一颗红心关不住
    郭嘉宏已经被工作组“拘禁”将近三个月了。但是，拘禁只能限制他的行动，却关不住他那一颗无私的红心。
    有一天，郭嘉宏正坐在“拘禁”他的小屋里学习毛主席著作，忽听室外有人叫喊：“蚕室失火啦！”“电线走电了！快点关电源！”
    郭嘉宏抬头往窗外一看，只见对面蚕室里闪着火光，冒着烟。这时，正是下午四点钟光景，男同志都在田里劳动，只有耕读学校的几个女同学在照料蚕室。蚕室里都是芦帘、竹子等易燃物；在一排排蚕匾里，秋蚕正在上山吐丝。要是火着起来，国家财产要受到严重损失。
    无私的战士郭嘉宏，怎么能看着人民的财产受损失而不顾？！他忘记了自己是被“拘禁”的人，立即冲出拘禁他的那间小房间，随手抄起一根竹竿，直奔蚕室的东头。他用力挑断装在屋角上的电源保险丝，随后紧跟大家跑进蚕室去救火。由于电源已断，抢救及时，终于没有成灾。
    谁知这件事，后来竟被执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组诬为“郭嘉宏想逃跑”、“想自杀”，并且开会斗争他。郭嘉宏只是冷冷地朝他们笑了一笑。
    “燕雀安知鸿鹄之志！”那些资产阶级老爷们，怎么能够理解无产阶级革命战士一心为公的革命胸怀呢！
    应该要那块田？
    无私的人，才能胸怀全局，想到整体。
    去年二月里的一天下午，一队队长郭嘉宏上工区研究分田的事情。当时蚕桑工区为了便于生产管理，把新开垦的芦圩荒田分成东西两片。河西的一块，土质差，地势低，杂草丛生，管理起来要花力气。
    应该要那块田呢？郭嘉宏二话没说，主动要了西边的田，并且向工区表示一定要把这块田管好。
    回到队里，不少同志埋怨他是“傻瓜”。晚上，郭嘉宏和大家一起带着问题学习毛主席著作《关于重庆谈判》。他说：“当时，我心里也有斗争。但是，毛主席教导我们：‘我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。’我们应该见方便就让，见重担就挑。如果能在不利条件下做出好的成绩，那才是光荣。一事当先，先替自己的小集体着想，那样还能把我们的国家、我们的农场建设好？！”这番话，使原来有埋怨情绪的同志，心胸豁然开朗起来。接着，大家又学习了《愚公移山》，并且一致表示：一定要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”！
    无私才能无畏。在大热天里，郭嘉宏赤着膊，同大家一起向新开垦的荒田开战，同旱魔顽强搏斗，晒得身上乌黑发亮。如今，生荒地已经变成熟田，郭嘉宏的共产主义精神也深深印在大家心里。
    灵魂深处闹革命
    去年五月，郭嘉宏从一队调到工区办的耕读中学协助工作。一队的同志恋恋不舍，耕读中学的学生也热情欢迎他。很多同学亲切地喊他“郭老师”，还有的喊他“主任”“校长”的。郭嘉宏虽然不要同学这样称呼他，可是内心却有一种说不出的高兴。
    他马上意识到，这是个人主义在抬头，决不能让它轻易放过！晚上，他带着问题学习了毛主席著作，对照自己的思想作了深刻的检查。他在日记上写道：“许多英雄、先进人物，每当取得成绩时，总是受一次表扬进行一次检查；当得到领导提拔时，首先想到的是革命的担子更重，更加要兢兢业业。而我想的完全两样，这是一种资产阶级的名利观点，是私心杂念在头脑里泛滥，应该严肃地把它斗垮。我认识到只有斗垮个人主义，克服骄傲情绪，才能永远前进。毛主席说：‘有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。’我一定牢记住毛主席的教导，放下包袱，轻装前进。”
    郭嘉宏就是这样经常抓住头脑里一闪而过的私心杂念，在灵魂深处闹革命，不断破私立公，促进自己的思想革命化。
    向人民负责
    去年五月，一队的几个青年，准备把一个工人出身的青年的家史编成话剧，用文娱形式来宣传毛泽东思想，回击反党反社会主义分子邓拓之流的无耻谰言。已经调到耕读学校工作的郭嘉宏听到消息后，马上翻过山坡，跑到一队，表示大力支持。他说：“这个戏一定要演好，这既能教育群众，也能教育我们自己。”他还具体帮助他们修改剧本，突出革命群众的革命造反精神。那知道，这件事却遭到工区的资产阶级老爷的无理阻挠。几个青年有点犹豫了。郭嘉宏鼓励他们说：“我们是为了宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，应该坚持下去！”他还斩钉截铁地说：“我们宣传毛泽东思想，决不要那些坏家伙批准！”当晚，他们又兴高采烈地开始排练，郭嘉宏也在他们中间欢乐地唱着，笑着。
    工区的资产阶级老爷把郭嘉宏视为眼中钉，经常在大会小会上点郭嘉宏的名，并且用“小右派”的帽子来压制他。好心的同志劝郭嘉宏，以后再不要“得罪”别人，免得受到打击报复。郭嘉宏严肃地回答说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们的责任，是向人民负责。’谁有缺点和错误，都应该毫不留情地向他指出，不能有任何私心杂念。有人用‘右派’帽子来压我，我也不怕。只要我是对党对人民负责任，暂时受点委屈也不要紧。”　　　　（新华社南京二十五日电）
