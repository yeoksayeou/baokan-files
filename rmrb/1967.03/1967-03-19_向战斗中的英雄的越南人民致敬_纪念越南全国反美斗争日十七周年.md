Today marks the seventeenth anniversary of Vietnam's National Day of Resistance against the United States. On this glorious occasion, the Chinese people warmly celebrate the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and extend our highest revolutionary salute to the heroic Vietnamese people in their battle!

Seventeen years ago today, students and citizens of Saigon held a massive anti-U.S. demonstration, protesting against the provocations of U.S. imperialism and driving away the U.S. destroyer that had intruded into Saigon's waters. This was the first historic victory for the Vietnamese people in their resistance against U.S. imperialism's aggression and intervention.

Over the past seventeen years, U.S. imperialism's intervention and aggression against Vietnam have intensified and expanded step by step. Initially, U.S. imperialism supported the French colonialists and the South Vietnamese reactionaries in massacring the South Vietnamese people from behind the scenes. Later, it replaced the French colonialists and openly took the lead. It started by providing money and weapons, directing the puppet regime in South Vietnam to fight, and eventually sent hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to launch a large-scale war of aggression. After suffering defeats in South Vietnam, it extended the war to North Vietnam. The seventeen-year history of Vietnam has proven that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and of all oppressed nations in the world. Any oppressed nation seeking complete independence and liberation must be prepared at all times to counter U.S. imperialism's intervention and aggression, and to fight to the death against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. This is a law of contemporary international class struggle.

The heroic Vietnamese people are a people who dare to struggle and dare to win. They have waged a long, arduous, and heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism and achieved tremendous victories. Currently, the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people have liberated four-fifths of the land and one thousand people in South Vietnam, and firmly hold the initiative in the war, placing the more than 400,000 U.S. aggressor troops in a passive and desperate situation. This favorable situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield is entirely the result of the South Vietnamese people following the correct line of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. As long as there is a firm revolutionary line, daring to fight, daring to charge, daring to sacrifice, and daring to overcome any difficulty, and persisting in armed struggle, the people's revolutionary armed forces, even if they start small, will eventually grow and defeat the ferocious enemy in battle. The brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation greatly inspire the revolutionary people of the world and provide a shining example and valuable experience for all oppressed peoples and nations.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives. They will never become Buddhas until their doom." Although U.S. imperialism has suffered heavy defeats in Vietnam, it is unwilling to accept defeat and will continue to struggle desperately.

Recently, the Johnson administration, in active collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership, has been busy with the "peace talks" hoax while frantically escalating the war of aggression in Vietnam. In South Vietnam, the United States is sending in large numbers of troops and launching an unprecedented "dry season offensive" against the liberated areas. In North Vietnam, U.S. bandit planes are savagely bombing the Thuyen Chau Steel Plant, the Vinh industrial area, and Hanoi and Haiphong. U.S. aggressor troops are shelling the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from south of the demilitarized zone, continuously escalating the war. U.S. President Johnson personally led the military and political leaders of Washington to Guam on the 18th to hold a high-level meeting with the commanders of U.S. troops in Vietnam and the heads of the puppet government in South Vietnam to deploy new plans for military adventurism. The facts show that U.S. imperialism is stubbornly pursuing the policy of expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam.

However, the Vietnamese people's will to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation is as unshakable as the towering Truong Son Mountains. Whether it is imperialism or revisionism, it cannot shake it; whether the enemy plays the "peace talks" trick or uses war, it cannot shake it. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on February 28, calling on the South Vietnamese military and people to "strengthen unity, advance bravely, defeat the second 'dry season strategic counteroffensive' plan of the U.S. expeditionary forces and their puppet army, and all plans of aggression, and achieve greater and more brilliant victories." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on March 1, saying: "The Vietnamese people will further strengthen unity, fight resolutely, defend the North, liberate the South, and ultimately reunify the country, and make contributions to the defense of peace in Asia and the world." The 31 million Vietnamese people are determined to fight to the end. Any military adventurism by the Johnson administration will inevitably suffer even heavier blows and more disastrous defeats.

The Chinese government and people have long solemnly declared: We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and pledge to be the backbone of the Vietnamese people. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is currently underway with great fervor, will make this socialist state of proletarian dictatorship even stronger and more consolidated. The Chinese people will, with even greater enthusiasm and effort, fulfill our internationalist duty. No matter what storms and waves may come, the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will always stand firmly with our Vietnamese brothers, resolutely support the Vietnamese people, and thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism!

    向战斗中的英雄的越南人民致敬
    ——纪念越南全国反美斗争日十七周年
    今天是越南全国反美斗争日十七周年。在这一光辉的节日，中国人民热烈地祝贺兄弟的越南人民在抗美救国战争中所取得的辉煌胜利，并向战斗中的英雄的越南人民致以崇高的革命的敬礼！
    十七年前的今天，西贡市的学生和市民举行声势浩大的反美游行示威，抗议美帝国主义的挑衅活动，把闯入西贡海面的美国驱逐舰赶了出去。这是越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的第一个具有历史意义的胜利。
    十七年来，美帝国主义对越南的干涉和侵略，一步步地加紧，一步步地扩大。起初，美帝国主义在背后帮助法国殖民者和南越反动派屠杀南越人民。以后它就取法国殖民者而代之，自己公开出面干。它从出钱、出枪，指挥南越的傀儡打仗，一直到直接派遣几十万美国军队发动一场大规模的侵略战争。它在越南南方打了败仗，又把战火烧到越南北方。十七年的越南历史证明，美帝国主义是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界一切被压迫民族的死敌。世界上任何一个被压迫民族，要争取彻底的独立和解放，就必须随时准备对付美帝国主义的干涉和侵略，并且准备同美帝国主义及其走狗决一死战。这是当代国际阶级斗争的一条规律。
    英雄的越南人民是敢于斗争、敢于胜利的人民。他们同美帝国主义进行了长期的艰苦卓绝的斗争，取得了极其伟大的胜利。现在，越南南方人民的武装力量已经解放了南越五分之四的土地和一千万人民，并且紧紧地掌握着战争的主动权，把四十多万美国侵略军完全置于被动挨打的狼狈境地。南越战场上的这个大好形势，完全是南越人民遵循正确的抗美救国的路线打出来的。只要有坚定的革命路线，敢打，敢冲，敢拚，敢于战胜任何困难，把武装斗争坚持下去，人民的革命武装力量即便开始是弱小的，终究会在战斗中成长壮大，最后打败凶恶的敌人。越南人民抗美救国战争的光辉胜利，大大地鼓舞了全世界的革命人民，给一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族提供了光辉的榜样和宝贵的经验。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”美帝国主义在越南尽管已经遭到惨重的失败，但它是决不甘心的，它还要进行疯狂的挣扎。
    最近，约翰逊政府在苏联修正主义领导集团的积极配合下，一面大搞“和谈”骗局，一面疯狂地加紧扩大侵越战争。在越南南方，美国正大量增兵，向解放区发动空前规模的“旱季攻势”。在越南北方，美国强盗飞机野蛮轰炸太原钢铁厂、越池工业区和河内、海防，美国侵略军从非军事区以南炮轰越南民主共和国的领土，不断地进行战争“升级”。美国总统约翰逊已于十八日亲自率领华盛顿的大小军政头目飞往关岛，同侵越美军司令和南越伪政权头目举行高级会议，部署新的战争冒险计划。事实表明，美帝国主义正在越南顽固地推行扩大侵略战争的方针。
    但是，越南人民抗美救国的斗争意志，象巍峨的长山一样，是不可动摇的。帝国主义也好，修正主义也好，决不能动摇它；敌人玩弄“和谈”一手也好，使用战争一手也好，都不能动摇它。越南南方民族解放阵线二月二十八日发表声明，号召南越军民“加强团结，勇往直前，打败美国远征军及其傀儡军队的第二次‘旱季战略反攻’计划和一切侵略计划，夺取更大更辉煌的胜利。”越南民主共和国外交部三月一日发表声明说：“越南人民将进一步加强团结，坚决战斗，保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。”越南三千一百万人民决心打下去、打到底。约翰逊政府任何军事冒险，都必将受到更加沉重的打击，遭到更加惨重的失败。
    中国政府和人民早就庄严宣告：我们下定决心，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，誓作越南人民的后盾。目前正在轰轰烈烈进行的无产阶级文化大革命，将使中国这个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家更加强大，更加巩固。中国人民将以更高的热情和更大的努力，履行我们的国际主义义务。不管出现什么样的惊涛骇浪，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，永远坚定地同兄弟的越南人民站在一起，坚决支援越南人民，彻底打败美帝国主义！
