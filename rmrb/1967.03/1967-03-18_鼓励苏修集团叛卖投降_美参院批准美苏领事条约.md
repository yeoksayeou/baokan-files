The U.S. Senate approves the U.S.-Soviet Consular Treaty

	WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) — As U.S. imperialism is frantically expanding the war in Vietnam, the U.S. Senate approved on March 16 the consular treaty signed by the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union in 1964. This treaty is the product of intensified collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and is a step taken by U.S. imperialism to further encourage the Soviet revisionist leadership to betray and surrender. According to the treaty, if the Soviet government arrests an American in the Soviet Union, it must notify the U.S. side within three days and must allow the U.S. side to contact the arrested American criminal within four days. According to the treaty, after it comes into effect, the governments of the U.S. and the Soviet Union can negotiate to open consulates in some cities of each other.

	After the U.S. Senate approved this treaty, U.S. President Johnson specially issued a statement praising the consular treaty for protecting Americans "traveling" in the Soviet Union. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk also believed that "this is a step with very little cost but very beneficial to national interests."

	U.S. officials and newspapers all applauded the U.S. Senate's approval of this treaty, believing it to be a step toward "improving" U.S.-Soviet relations. The Associated Press clearly stated that the U.S. Senate's action to approve this treaty "during the Vietnam War" has "significance beyond the content of the treaty."

	The U.S.-Soviet consular treaty is one link in the chain of their intensified global collusion. While the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are conspiring to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, they are also expanding U.S.-Soviet trade, signing deceptive "peaceful use of outer space" treaties, and actively promoting the big fraud of "preventing nuclear proliferation." Some of these have already been finalized, while others are making significant progress. Johnson recently admitted that all of these, as well as the U.S.-Soviet consular treaty, are "very desirable actions in line with U.S. national interests."

### 鼓励苏修集团叛卖投降  美参院批准美苏领事条约

    鼓励苏修集团叛卖投降
    美参院批准美苏领事条约
    新华社十七日讯　华盛顿消息：当美帝国主义正在疯狂地扩大侵越战争的时候，美国参议院十六日批准了美苏两国政府在一九六四年签订的领事条约。这个条约是美苏加紧勾结的产物，是美帝国主义进一步鼓励苏联修正主义领导集团叛卖投降的一个步骤。根据条约的规定，苏联政府如果逮捕了在苏联犯罪的美国人，必须在三天以内通知美国方面，并且必须在四天以内让美国方面同被逮捕的美国罪犯进行接触。据条约规定，在条约生效后，美苏两国政府可以经过谈判互相在对方的一些城市开设领事馆。
    美国总统约翰逊在美国参议院批准这个条约后，特别发表声明，赞扬领事条约将保护在苏联“旅行”的美国人。美国国务卿腊斯克也认为“这是一个所花代价很小而却非常有利于国家利益的步骤”。
    美国官方和报刊都为美国参议院批准这个条约拍手叫好，认为这是“改善”美苏关系的一个步骤。合众国际社明白地说，美国参议院“在越南战争进行当中”批准这个条约的行动，“具有超乎条约内容的重要性”。
    美苏领事条约是双方加紧全球大勾结中的一环。美帝和苏修在共谋扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争烈火的同时，在扩大美苏贸易、签订欺骗性的“和平利用外层空间条约”、积极推行“防止核扩散”的大骗局等方面，有的已经拍板成交，有的正在取得显著的进展。约翰逊不久前承认，所有这些以及美苏签订的领事条约都是“符合美国国家利益的非常可取的行动”。
