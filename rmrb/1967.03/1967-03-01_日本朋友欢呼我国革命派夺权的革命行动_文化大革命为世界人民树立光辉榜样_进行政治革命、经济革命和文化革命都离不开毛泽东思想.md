The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is steadily advancing and achieving great victories, greatly inspiring the revolutionary people of Japan. They enthusiastically hail the revolutionary actions of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power from the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, saying, "It's great!"

Japanese friends emphasize that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has set a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of the world in smashing the old world and creating a new world.

The vice-chairman of the Fukoka Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Kashiwagi Masakazu, warmly praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, saying it provides a model for the revolutionary people of the world. He says it offers a criterion for distinguishing true from false Marxism-Leninism.

He said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has given boundless courage, strength, and confidence to the people of the world who are striving for national liberation and defending world peace."

Kashiwagi said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is displaying tremendous power, has dealt the heaviest blows to U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, accelerating the downfall of imperialism and the liberation of the people of the world."

The president of Kyushu Friendship Trade Company, Fujisawa Kazuyoshi, praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as an unprecedented undertaking and a pioneering achievement in the international communist movement.

He said, "The Japanese people want a revolution, and they must learn from the experience of the Chinese revolution. To prevent the emergence of revisionism, they must also learn from the experience of the Chinese revolution." Fujisawa, quoting Chairman Mao's famous dictum that "the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history," said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a concentrated expression of this famous dictum." He enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao as a great leader who truly trusts the masses and lets the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves.

Fujisawa said, "Today, whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is not a Marxist-Leninist." He stressed that whether one is conducting a political revolution, an economic revolution, or a cultural revolution, one cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought.

A high school teacher from Shimoniwa City told a Chinese reporter, "Chairman Mao has enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism on the question of how to maintain and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat after the proletariat seizes power. Chairman Mao is a great thinker and a great revolutionary."

A union cadre named Kono from Shimoniwa City said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has had a tremendous impact on the people of Japan. The great achievements of this cultural revolution are the common wealth of the people of the world. It is not only related to the fate of China but also to the fate of the revolution in Japan and the world."

A social activist from Fukoka Prefecture said, "The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the greatest encouragement and support for the Japanese people who are struggling. He expressed his determination to struggle for the liberation of the Japanese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

A young farmer from Yamaguchi Prefecture said, "Inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the Red Guards' long marches, a group of young men and women in the village where I live recently organized a Long March Team. They are planning to march 50 kilometers in their residential area, contact society, visit the poor and distressed, and promote Chinese publications to spread Mao Zedong Thought."

A high school teacher who recently returned from a visit to China enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao for cultivating a new generation of Chinese youth into completely new people, thereby ensuring that China will forever follow the socialist road to victory. The teacher told a Chinese reporter that after returning to his country, he introduced the actual situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China at various meetings and school classrooms, and was warmly welcomed by the masses and students.
