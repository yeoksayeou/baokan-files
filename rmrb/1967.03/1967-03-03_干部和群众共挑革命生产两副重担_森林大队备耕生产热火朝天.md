Cadres and the Masses Shoulder Two Heavy Burdens of Revolution and Production
Forest Brigade's Spring Ploughing Production is in Full Swing

People's Daily reports: The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Forest Brigade in Fuyuan People's Commune, Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, have followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, correctly treated the cadres of the brigade and production teams, and shouldered the two heavy burdens of revolution and production with revolutionary cadres. They have made the current spring ploughing production a roaring success.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Forest Brigade have realized: The majority of the cadres of the brigade and production teams support the Party and Chairman Mao and are determined to follow the socialist road. Those who are a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party must be resolutely overthrown, while those who follow the socialist road must be resolutely supported. For cadres who have made mistakes, they should be educated and united with them according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient."

The poor and lower-middle peasants used the method of class analysis to comprehensively analyze the brigade cadres and treated them differently. For relatively good cadres, they were invited to participate in the brigade's leadership work, trusted, supported, and worked with them. In this way, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were further isolated and struck down, the majority of revolutionary cadres were united, and spring ploughing production was well done.

The brigade leader, Yu Jun, has high revolutionary enthusiasm. He said to the poor and lower-middle peasants: "Let's work together to seize the revolution and do a good job in spring ploughing, determined to achieve a bumper harvest this year." Under his leadership, more than 120 team members worked very hard when repairing water conservancy facilities. The team leader of the third production team, Wang Zhenquan, has some shortcomings and mistakes. The poor and lower-middle peasants helped him correct his mistakes and let him continue to serve as the team leader. He expressed: He will definitely do a good job and work with everyone to seize the revolution and promote spring ploughing.

    干部和群众共挑革命生产两副重担
    森林大队备耕生产热火朝天
    本报讯　黑龙江省巴彦县富源公社森林大队的贫下中农，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，正确地对待大队和生产队的干部，和革命干部一道挑起革命和生产两副重担，把当前备耕生产搞得热火朝天。
    森林大队的贫下中农认识到：大队和生产队的干部，大多数是拥护党，拥护毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路的。对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，必须坚决打倒，而对于走社会主义道路的干部，就要坚决支持。对于犯有错误的干部，要按照毛主席
  “惩前毖后、治病救人”的教导，教育他们，团结他们。
    贫下中农用阶级分析的方法，对大队干部进行了全面分析，加以区别对待。对比较好的干部，吸收他们参加大队领导工作，相信他们，支持他们，和他们一道工作。这样就更加有力地孤立和打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，团结了绝大多数革命干部，搞好了备耕生产。
    大队长于俊的革命积极性非常高，他向贫下中农说：“咱们共同努力，抓好革命，搞好备耕，决心夺取今年农业大丰收。”在他带领下，一百二十多名社员兴修水利时，干得十分起劲。第三生产队队长王振全，有一些缺点和错误，贫下中农帮助他改正错误，让他继续担任队长。他表示：一定积极做好工作，和大家一起大抓革命，大促备耕。
