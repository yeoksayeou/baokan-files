	Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Condemns US Use of Thai Bases for Bombing
	Vietnamese People Resolutely Fight Back Against US-Thai Aggression

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 14th, it was reported by local newspapers on the 14th that the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 13th. The statement pointed out that on March 9th, the US aggressors and the Thai reactionary regime openly announced that US aircraft were using Thai bases to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Their plot is to prepare public opinion so as to use the Thai bases more extensively, serving the US plan to further strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina.

	The statement said, the Vietnamese people who are resolutely fighting for the independence, freedom, and peace of their motherland, and the entire people of Indochina, will certainly take necessary self-defense measures to counter the war actions of US imperialism and its Thai lackeys. The Thai people will certainly not forgive US imperialism and the Thanom-Prapas regime for expanding the war. Under the banner of the Patriotic Front of Thailand, the Thai people who resolutely fight against the US aggressors and their reactionary lackey regime will certainly achieve glorious victories. The US aggressors and their Thai lackeys must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences caused by their aggressive actions.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, March 12th, Bangkok news: According to Thai newspapers, just as US imperialism further expands the war of aggression against Vietnam, on the 9th, US imperialism and the Thanom-Prapas regime of Thailand openly admitted that US Air Force planes were using Thai bases to bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	According to Agence France-Presse, the commander of the US Air Force in Thailand admitted on the 9th that two years ago, the US had been using air bases in Thailand to carry out the criminal activities of bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. A large number of the planes bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam took off from Thai bases.

	According to reports, the US has already established about sixty bases for sea, land, air forces, rocket launch sites, and radar stations in Thailand. In January of this year, the Thanom-Prapas regime also decided to send 2,295 mercenary troops to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for the US war of aggression in Vietnam.

	The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station recently emphasized that the Thai people cannot sit idly by as US imperialism and the Thanom-Prapas regime push the Thai people into the abyss of death. The Thai people will continue to fight resolutely with the people of the world against US imperialism and its lackeys.

    据新华社河内十四日电　据此间报纸十四日报道，越南民主共和国外交部发言人十三日发表声明指出，美国侵略者和泰国反动当局三月九日公然宣布美国飞机使用泰国基地袭击越南民主共和国，它们的阴谋在于作好舆论准备，以便更多地利用泰国基地，为美国进一步加强和扩大侵略越南和印度支那的战争的计划服务。
    声明说，正在为自己祖国的独立、自由、和平而坚决战斗的越南人民和整个印度支那人民，一定要采取应有的自卫措施抗击美帝国主义及其泰国走狗的战争行动。泰国人民也决不会饶恕美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团扩大战争的行动。在泰国爱国阵线的旗帜下，坚决抗击美帝国主义侵略者及其反动走狗政权的泰国人民，一定取得辉煌的胜利。美国侵略者及其泰国走狗必须对由它们的侵略行动所造成的一切严重后果承担全部责任。
    据新华社十二日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，正当美帝国主义进一步扩大侵越战争的时候，美帝国主义和泰国他侬—巴博集团九日公开承认美国空军飞机使用泰国基地轰炸越南民主共和国。
    据法新社报道，美国驻泰国空军部队司令九日供认，两年以前美国就利用在泰国的空军基地进行轰炸越南民主共和国的罪恶活动。美国轰炸越南民主共和国的飞机，大量是由泰国基地起飞的。
    据报道，目前美国已经在泰国设立了海、陆、空军基地、火箭发射基地和雷达站约六十处。今年一月，他侬—巴博集团并决定派遣两千二百九十五名帮凶军去南越充当美国侵越战争的炮灰。
      “泰国人民之声”电台最近强调指出，泰国人民决不能坐视美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团把泰国人民推向死亡的深渊，泰国人民将和全世界人民一起，继续同美帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争。
