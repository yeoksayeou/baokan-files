I have been a cadre for eight years. During these eight years, I have made many mistakes. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I was afraid, did not trust the masses, and always feared that someone would take the opportunity to attack me. At that time, although I expressed my attitude at meetings: "I am willing to seriously examine my mistakes and hope that everyone will dare to expose them, and I will not retaliate." But when the masses actually put up big-character posters about me, my thoughts went astray, and I developed a sense of resistance. The first thing I thought of was not "if there is, correct it; if there isn't, add to it," but rather I suspected who was out to get me. At night, I lay in bed and couldn't sleep, so I got up in the middle of the night to write a big-character poster. After writing it, I hesitated a bit, wondering if it was right to put it up. Just as I was undecided, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Because we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and exposure. No matter who points out our mistakes, we should welcome them. As long as you are right, we will correct them." My thoughts were in fierce struggle, thinking: usually we say we are servants of the people, serving the people, why can't we bear it when the masses put up big-character posters? Isn't this fearing the masses, fearing the revolution? The more I thought about it, the more I felt something was wrong, feeling that I had not acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Thinking of this, I decided not to put up the big-character poster.

However, my thoughts were not completely clear, and I always felt that being a cadre was a disadvantage, wanting to drop the responsibility and not do it anymore. But then I thought, I can't do that. This Cultural Revolution is personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and it is a severe test for every cadre, testing whether we truly stand on the side of the revolutionary people. If I drop the responsibility and don't do it, that would be a mistake upon a mistake, letting down Chairman Mao and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. So I decided to continue, not letting the masses' criticisms affect collective production.

The "self" often played tricks in my mind, making me feel that I couldn't keep up with the situation. So I turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao taught us: "The situation is constantly changing, to make our thoughts adapt to the new situation, we must learn." Therefore, every night I insisted on studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and important articles from the "People's Daily" and "Red Flag" magazine. Comparing with Chairman Mao's teachings, I seriously reflected on what I had done that was not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, not in line with the party's policies, and not in the interests of the people since I became a cadre. I found thirty-two problems with myself and actively went to the revolutionary committee director of the brigade, requesting to make a self-criticism to the masses. During the self-criticism, the masses criticized me sharply, not sparing any feelings. At first, I didn't understand what it meant to touch the soul, but through the masses' help, I understood: it means to bring out the "self" in your mind, analyze and criticize it, making you convinced.

The poor and lower-middle peasants sincerely told me: "We criticize you completely to cure the illness and save the person, not to knock you down, but to point out the direction for you, to do the work better!" The poor and lower-middle peasants' sincere hearts deeply educated me and moved me, making me truly feel the warmth of class love, feeling that revolutionary masses are reasonable. I expressed my determination to the poor and lower-middle peasants, saying that I am willing to work actively under their supervision, without any conditions, forever following Chairman Mao, and resolutely revolutionizing to the end!

My ideological problems were basically solved, but the resistance from my family was still great. At that time, the masses put up many big-character posters about me, and my mother was angry, saying: "Being a cadre brings so many troubles, so many criticisms, what do they want to do to my son?" My wife also complained: "You work all day, and in the end, you get a lot of faults." The family pulled me back, not wanting me to be a cadre. I patiently did work with them, guiding them to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, telling them: "Now we poor and lower-middle peasants have stood up, become the masters of the state, if we poor and lower-middle peasants don't manage collective affairs, who will? If we poor and lower-middle peasants don't do it, who will?" This way, their thoughts also became clear.

At the same time, I also did work with other cadres, talking with them, sharing my experiences, and encouraging everyone to revolutionize together.

I also actively sought out the masses who had criticized me the most, opening my heart to them, thanking them for their help, and hoping that they would point out any shortcomings and mistakes I had in the future, at any time.

Not long ago, our brigade held elections for the brigade management committee. I was again elected as the brigade leader. The first thing the newly appointed cadres did was to study together the quotations from Chairman Mao: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the party, these are two fundamental principles. If you doubt these two principles, then you can't do anything." "Our Communist Party and the Communist Party-led Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the interests of the people." The cadres expressed their determination, saying: "In the Cultural Revolution, we have been educated, and we must take action, achieving new successes in spring plowing and production."

Now, the spring plowing season has begun. The key to a year's work is in the spring. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and launch the first shot of spring plowing production! Since last winter, our village has sent out more than 250 carts of fertilizer, all wheat fields have been pressed, and nearly 300 mu of bare land has also been pressed. We have also smashed more than 200 mu of land with clods. Now, we are fertilizing, cleaning fertilizer, and covering wheat to preserve moisture. We will definitely implement Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," be self-reliant, and make greater contributions to the country.

    我是怎样站起来革命的
    大兴县河津营大队队长  李书臣
    我当干部已经八年了。这八年当中，犯了不少错误。无产阶级文化大革命开始时，我“怕”字当头，不相信群众，总怕有人借机整我。当时尽管我在会上表示态度：“愿意认真检查自己的错误，希望大家大胆揭发，决不打击报复。”可是群众真起来给我贴大字报了，我的思想就出了岔，产生了抵触情绪。首先想到的不是“有则改之，无则加勉”，而是怀疑谁和我过不去，晚上躺在床上怎么也睡不着，就半夜起来写大字报。写好后又有点犹豫，这么做对不对呢？贴出去好不好呢？正在拿不定主意的时候，我想起了毛主席的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”我思想上展开了激烈的斗争，心想：平时老说当人民的勤务员，为人民服务，为什么群众刚一贴出大字报就受不了呢？这不是怕群众，怕革命吗？越想越不对劲，觉得自己没有按照毛主席的指示办事。想到这里，我决定不把大字报贴出去了。
    可是，我的思想并没有完全搞通，总觉得当干部吃亏，想撂挑子不干了。可是又一想，不能这样做。这次文化大革命是毛主席亲自发动和领导的，对每个干部都是一场严峻的考验，考验我们是不是真正站在革命人民方面。我如果撂挑子不干，那就错上加错，对不起毛主席他老人家，对不起广大的贫下中农。于是我下决心干下去，决不因群众提了意见而影响集体生产。
    头脑中“私”字经常作怪，我感到自己跟不上形势，于是就向毛主席著作请教。毛主席教导我们：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”因此，我每天晚上坚持学习《毛主席语录》和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志重要文章。对照着毛主席的教导，我认真地回想从当干部以来做了哪些不符合毛泽东思想、不符合党的政策、不符合人民利益的事。我给自己找出了三十二个问题，并主动地找到大队文革主任，要求向群众作检查。在检查过程中，群众对我揭发、批判得很尖锐，一点不讲情面。开始我不理解什么叫触及灵魂，通过群众帮助，我明白了：就是把你思想里头的“私”字给端出来，分析批判，说得你心服口服。
    贫下中农诚恳地对我说：“我们批评你，完全是为了治病救人，决不是要把你整倒，是为了给你指出方向，把工作搞得更好！”贫下中农的一片诚心深深地教育了我，感动了我，我真正感到阶级友爱的温暖，感到革命群众是通情达理的。我向贫下中农表示了决心，我愿在贫下中农的监督下积极工作，不讲任何条件，永远跟着毛主席，坚决革命到底！
    我的思想问题基本解决了，可是，家庭的阻力还很大。当时，群众给我贴了许多大字报，我母亲生气了，她说：“当干部招来这么多事，提了那么多意见，到底要把我儿子怎么样？”我媳妇也埋怨说：“你一天到晚干工作，到头来还弄一身毛病。”家里拖我的后腿，想不叫我当干部了。我就耐心地给她们做工作，引导她们忆苦思甜，告诉她们：“现在我们贫下中农翻了身，成了国家的主人，集体的事我们贫下中农不管，谁管？我们贫下中农不干，谁干？”这样，她们的思想也就通了。
    同时，我也给其他干部做了工作，找他们谈心，说了自己的体会，鼓励大家共同干革命。
    我还主动地找了向我提意见较多的群众，向他们交心，感谢他们的帮助，并希望他们以后发现我有什么缺点和错误，随时随地给指出来。
    不久前，我们大队改选了大队管委会。我又被选为大队长。新上任的干部第一件事就是共同学习毛主席语录：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”干部们表示决心说：“在文化大革命中受了教育，得拿出行动来，在春耕生产中立新功。”
    眼下，春耕大忙开始了。一年之计在于春，我们坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，打响春耕生产第一炮！去冬以来，我村送出肥料二百五十多车，麦地都已压完，白地也压了近三百亩，还砸了二百多亩地的坷垃。现在，我们正在积肥、清肥，搂麦保墒。我们一定贯彻毛主席提出的“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，自力更生，为国家做出更大的贡献。
