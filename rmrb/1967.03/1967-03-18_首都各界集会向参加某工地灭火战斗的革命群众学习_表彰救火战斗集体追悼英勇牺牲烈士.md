	Capital's Various Circles Hold Meeting to Learn from Revolutionary Masses Who Participated in Firefighting at a Construction Site, Commend Firefighting Collective, and Mourn Martyrs Who Sacrificed Their Lives

	Mao Zedong Thought Nurtures the Most Courageous People

	A New Ode to "Public Spirit" in the Cultural Revolution

	Xinhua News Agency, March 17th—Over 2,000 workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres from the capital held a grand meeting on March 9th to commend the revolutionary masses who spontaneously formed a strong fighting collective during a fire at a construction site. These individuals bravely fought, fearing no sacrifice, and quickly extinguished the blaze, preventing significant loss of state property. The meeting also honored the proletarian revolutionary fighters who, in the face of danger, remained steadfast and selfless, sacrificing their lives to save state property. Among them was Guo Jiaming, a martyr who fought bravely.

	The meeting was presided over by the Revolutionary Committee of the Capital's Universities and Colleges. Representatives from the "June 15th" Red Rebel Corps in Zhenjiang, where Guo Jiaming had been active, and the martyr's family members also attended the meeting.

	The political commissar of the People's Liberation Army unit responsible for the construction site introduced many heroic deeds of the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought during the firefighting efforts.

	At 5:10 PM on January 19th, a fire broke out at a construction site in Beijing due to a lighting fixture igniting a grass curtain on a temporary shelter. In an instant, the site became a sea of flames, threatening the entire construction area and the surrounding buildings. At this critical moment, soldiers on the site immediately rushed into the fire, bravely fighting to extinguish it. Revolutionary masses from nearby roads, offices, and residential areas also rushed to the scene from all directions. Some were passing by on urgent business, others were busy at work in their offices, and some had already bought train tickets and were heading to the station. However, they all treated the fire as a command and firefighting as a battle mission, rushing into the flames without hesitation to fight the fire bravely. Within a few minutes, over 10,000 people had gathered at the fire scene. They came from more than ten provinces and regions, including Jilin, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi. Although they came from all corners of the country, they all showed their loyalty in the face of the fire. The fire scene became a vivid classroom of Mao Zedong Thought. The spirit of selflessly dedicating oneself to the people guided everyone in launching a magnificent firefighting battle.

	Platoon Leader Yuan Zhiqui of the People's Liberation Army rushed to the edge of a collapsing platform. The wooden beams above his head were on fire, and if they broke, the platform above with more than ten comrades fighting selflessly to save state property would collapse. However, the platform was hanging in mid-air, and water could not be sprayed, nor could soil be thrown. The situation was extremely dangerous. At this moment, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit, it will vanquish all enemies and never be subdued by them," and resolutely took off his muddy cotton jacket to beat out the flames, using his hands to smother the burning wooden beams, extinguishing the fire. Worker Zheng Zhigang from the Jingxi Mining Area climbed onto the scaffolding several times to fight the fire but fell down each time. He thought of how revolutionary workers must use their lives to protect socialist construction and stood up firmly, climbing up again. He saw a soldier fainted in the fire zone and immediately rushed forward to carry him out. Zheng Zhigang then rushed back into the fire scene and fainted himself. The soldier who had just been rescued and regained consciousness rushed forward again to carry Zheng Zhigang out. Student Tang Chaogun from "New Peking University" was hit twice by falling wooden beams, causing him to see stars. He repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's words, "The more difficult the situation, the more we must go," and firmly rescued item after item from the fire. Financial Department staff member's wife Xie Xuelian saw that the fire hose had been cut, and she immediately covered it with her hands and body, allowing water to pour into her sleeves and soak her entire body. She endured the biting cold and persisted until the final victory. A pile of smoldering grass curtains caught fire again due to the wind, and a group of 13-14-year-old Red Guards, wearing soaked cotton jackets, jumped into the fire and rolled on the ground until they extinguished the flames.

	Among the heroic firefighting collective, Guo Jiaming, a proletarian revolutionary fighter from the Sericulture Section of Xiangshan Horticultural Farm in Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, stood out. He bravely rushed onto the roof of the temporary shelter, lifting off every five or six hundred-pound tarp to cut off the fire's path. Later, he sacrificed his life when the shelter collapsed due to the fire. This 24-year-old knowledge youth, who responded to the Party's call to go to the countryside to support agriculture, was a vanguard of the proletarian cultural revolution. He had been labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by those executing the bourgeois reactionary line and was detained for four months. This time, as a representative of twelve revolutionary organizations in Zhenjiang City, he was entrusted by the revolutionary masses of Zhenjiang City to come to Beijing to report the situation to relevant central departments. Passing by the fire scene, he bravely joined the firefighting battle, ultimately sacrificing his blood and life. The Zhenjiang Municipal Party Committee issued a notice on February 2nd, solemnly rehabilitating Guo Jiaming, and based on his performance and wishes before his martyrdom, posthumously recognizing him as a formal member of the Communist Party.

	Over 10,000 revolutionary masses, after 35 minutes of intense battle, finally extinguished the fire, saving the construction site.

	The fire was extinguished. Nearby hospitals sent ambulances and medical personnel to provide first aid to the injured. However, many of those injured in the firefighting left without waiting for their wounds to be dressed. Construction site personnel repeatedly asked them to leave their names and addresses, but they only pointed to their "Red Guards" or "Revolutionary Rebel Corps" armbands or simply said, "I am a son of the people." Those with more severe injuries who were hospitalized received the Party's and the people's warm care. Now they have all recovered and returned to their work and production posts.

	The revolutionary masses attending the meeting unanimously agreed that this firefighting battle was another ode to "public spirit" in the proletarian cultural revolution, showcasing the new spiritual realm reached by the broad revolutionary masses in the proletarian cultural revolution. It once again proved that the Chinese people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought are the most selfless, bravest, and most revolutionary. Everyone repeatedly expressed their determination to learn from the heroic firefighters.

    首都各界集会向参加某工地灭火战斗的革命群众学习
    表彰救火战斗集体追悼英勇牺牲烈士
    毛泽东思想哺育的人民最勇敢
    文化大革命中“公”字的新赞歌
    新华社十七日讯　首都的工农兵、红卫兵和革命干部两千多人，三月九日隆重举行集会，表彰在某建筑工地失火时自动结成坚强的战斗集体，勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，迅速扑灭大火，使国家财产免受重大损失的革命群众；同时追悼在救火中临危不惧，一心为公，为抢救国家财产壮烈牺牲的无产阶级革命派战士郭嘉宏烈士。
    大会由首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会主持。郭嘉宏烈士生前的战友镇江“六·一五”红色造反队的代表和烈士的家属也参加了大会。
    负责某建筑工地施工任务的中国人民解放军某部的政治委员，在会上介绍了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众在救火中许多可歌可泣的事迹。
    一月十九日下午五时十分，北京某建筑工地因照明电灯烤着了防寒棚的草帘，引起火灾。霎时工地成了一片火海，整个工地和两旁林立的建筑物面临着危险。在这紧急关头，在现场施工的解放军战士立刻冲进火海，奋勇扑救。临近工地的马路上和附近机关、居民区里的革命群众，也立即从四面八方迎着火光跑来。他们当中，有的是因急事路过当地的，有的正在机关里忙于工作，有的已经买好了火车票，正在赶往车站。但是他们都把火光当作命令，把救火当作战斗任务，毫不犹豫地冲进火海，同大火英勇搏斗。十几分钟之内，火场附近已集合了一万多人。这些人来自吉林、江苏、陕西等十几个省、区。他们虽然来自五湖四海，但都在火海面前献出了自己的一片丹心。火场变成了无比生动的毛泽东思想的大课堂。为人民赴汤蹈火的思想，指挥着人们展开了一场气壮山河的灭火战斗。
    解放军某部班长袁治启冲到快被烧塌的平台下面。他头顶上的木杆在燃烧，木杆一断，平台上十几个忘我抢救国家财产的战友就会摔下来。可是平台悬在半空，水浇不到，土扬不上去，情况十分危急。这时，他想到毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”，毅然脱下沾满泥水的棉衣抢打火苗，用双手捂到燃烧着的木杆上，扑灭烈火。京西矿区工人郑志强，几次爬到脚手架上去救火，都摔了下来。他想到我们革命工人一定要用生命来保卫社会主义建设时，就坚强地站起来，又向上爬去。他发现有个解放军战士昏倒在火区，又立刻抢上前去把他背走。郑志强再冲到火场，自己也昏倒了。那个被救出来刚刚苏醒的战士，又冲上去把郑志强背出来。“新北大”学生唐朝群两次被烧落的木头砸在头上，砸得他眼冒金星。他反复朗诵毛主席“越是困难的地方越是要去”等语录，坚定地把一件件器材从火堆里抢救出来。财政部职工家属谢学莲，看见消防车的水龙带划破了，立刻用手捂住，用身体堵住，水灌进她的袖筒，溅湿了她全身，她忍着刺骨的寒冷，一直坚持到最后胜利。一堆带着余烬的草帘被风一吹又燃烧起来，一群十三四岁的红卫兵，穿着被淋湿的棉袄跳进去，在火堆上打滚，直到把火滚灭。
    在英雄的救火集体中，来自江苏省镇江市象山园艺场蚕桑工区的无产阶级革命派战士郭嘉宏，是其中最突出的代表。他冒着熊熊烈火和滚滚浓烟，冲上防寒棚顶，掀掉每块五六百斤重的篷布截断火路，后来他因棚架烧断倒塌而光荣牺牲。这个响应党的号召下乡支援农业的二十四岁的知识青年，是无产阶级文化大革命中的闯将。他曾被执行资产阶级反动路线的人打成“反革命”，被拘禁达四个月之久。这次他作为镇江市十二个革命组织的代表，受镇江市革命群众的委托来京向中央有关部门反映情况，路过失火现场，就英勇投入灭火战斗，直至献出鲜血和生命。中共镇江市委已于二月二日发出通告，郑重为郭嘉宏平反，同时，根据郭嘉宏烈士生前的表现和要求，追认他为中共正式党员。
    一万多名革命群众，经过三十五分钟的激战，终于扑灭了大火，保住了建设工地。
    火灾扑灭了。附近医院开来了救护车，派来了医务人员，对负伤群众进行救护工作。但是，许多因救火负伤的人，不等包扎伤口就悄悄走了。工地的有关人员一再请他们留下姓名、住址，他们只是指一指臂上的“红卫兵”、“革命造反团”等袖章，或者简单说一句：“我是人民的儿子”。因伤势较重住院治疗的同志，得到了党和人民的亲切关怀。现在他们都已经伤愈出院，返回工作和生产岗位。
    参加集会的革命群众一致认为，这场灭火战斗，是无产阶级文化大革命中又一首“公”字的赞歌，显示了广大革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中所达到的崭新的精神境界。它再一次证明，毛泽东思想哺育下的中国人民，最无私，最勇敢，最革命。大家一再表示要向救火的英雄们学习。
