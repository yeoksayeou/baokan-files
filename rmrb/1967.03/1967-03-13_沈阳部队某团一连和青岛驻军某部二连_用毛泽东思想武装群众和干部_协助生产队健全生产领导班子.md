People's Liberation Army certain regiment's First Company, in supporting spring farming production, uses Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses, educate cadres, and actively assist local production teams in establishing production leadership teams, effectively promoting current spring farming production.

The company's cadres and soldiers enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production," resolutely executing the Central Military Commission's instructions on the army supporting spring farming production. Recently, they went to the nearby Dongxin Brigade to support spring farming production. The soldiers discovered that some production teams' leadership teams were not fully established, and leading production was difficult. They worked alongside the community members while studying the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" and the editorial from the fourth issue of the "Red Flag" magazine with the poor and lower-middle peasants and some cadres who had been criticized during the movement. The soldiers also conducted political and ideological work among the masses and cadres through home visits, individual conversations, and class education, encouraging them to remember bitterness and think sweetly. Through study, the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres all raised their awareness and decided to follow Chairman Mao's words and act accordingly. Cadres expressed their determination to stand up bravely, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production; community members expressed their active support for the cadres' actions, correcting their shortcomings and errors, and leading everyone to do a good job in production. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the fifth team conducted a specific analysis of Team Leader Gao Guangying, who had made mistakes during the Four Cleanups and the Cultural Revolution: Gao Guangying, 46 years old, from a poor peasant family, had been a pig herder for the landlord since childhood and had been exploited and oppressed for over a decade. After liberation, under the party's cultivation and education, he honorably joined the Communist Party of China. The masses elected him as a cadre, and for over a decade, he diligently followed the party and listened to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, he made some mistakes during the movement. After education, his ideological awareness improved, and he could seriously examine himself and express his determination to correct his mistakes with practical actions. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw that he could recognize his shortcomings and errors and correct them resolutely, so they forgave him and expressed their firm support for his work, which deeply moved him. Gao Guangying expressed his determination not to disappoint the trust and expectations of the poor and lower-middle peasants, to stand tall and work for the revolution, to seize power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and to strive for double victories in revolution and production.

The company's comrades also addressed the active thoughts of some cadres who were afraid of lacking experience and not being able to do a good job. They organized everyone to study the party's letter and Chairman Mao's relevant works, raising their awareness of being masters of the house, making everyone realize that seizing power for the poor and lower-middle peasants is glorious, and that fear is a manifestation of "selfishness" and is wrong. Team Leader Su Guochang of the first team, an old poor peasant, said with full confidence after studying: "Being a cadre is to worry for the poor and lower-middle peasants and to seize power for them. As long as we resolutely follow the party, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, I am not afraid of criticism from the masses. I will definitely lead everyone to do a good job in production."

According to Xinhua News Agency, the soldiers of the Second Company of a certain regiment in Qingdao went to the nearby Lijiazhuang Brigade to support spring farming. They found that some cadres did not dare to lead production boldly. They believed that to help Lijiazhuang Brigade implement the party's instructions, the key was to help the cadres stand up and strengthen the leadership of spring farming production. Therefore, while helping with spring farming production, they vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's cadre policy to the brigade cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. They first organized cadres and community members to repeatedly study the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" and the editorial from the fourth issue of the "Red Flag" magazine. Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's care deeply moved the cadres. Many cadres said with tears, "Chairman Mao cares for us like this, and the Central Committee believes in us. We must actively come out to seize the revolution and promote production." Brigade Leader Wang Weigong and Deputy Secretary Li Keyu, who were originally afraid of not being trusted by the masses, raised their awareness through study and expressed their determination to stand up bravely, work with the revolutionary masses, and forever follow Chairman Mao to do the revolution, determined to make amends in spring farming production.

To make Chairman Mao's cadre policy known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts, the soldiers of the Second Company also propagated Chairman Mao's teachings door to door. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants saw that the cadres who had made mistakes listened to Chairman Mao's words and actively seized the revolution and promoted production, and they enthusiastically supported them. With the help of the Second Company, this brigade quickly established the production leadership team, held a spring farming production rally, and the entire brigade's spring farming production presented a prosperous scene.

    沈阳部队某团一连和青岛驻军某部二连
    用毛泽东思想武装群众和干部
    协助生产队健全生产领导班子
    据新华社沈阳十二日电　人民解放军沈阳部队某团一连，在支援春耕生产中，用毛泽东思想武装群众，教育干部，积极协助驻地生产队健全领导生产的班子，有力地推动了当前春耕生产。
    一连的干部、战士积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚决执行中央军委关于军队支援春耕生产的指示，最近到驻地附近的东新大队支援春耕生产。指战员发现有些生产队领导生产的班子不够健全，领导生产有困难，就一边同社员一起劳动，一边同贫下中农和在运动中受过批评的一些干部共同学习《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》和《红旗》杂志第四期社论。指战员们还通过家庭访问、个别谈心和开展忆苦思甜阶级教育等方式，对群众和干部广泛进行了政治思想工作。经过学习，贫下中农、干部都提高了认识，都决心听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的话去做。干部表示勇敢地站起来，担起革命、生产两副担子；社员表示积极支持干部们行动起来，改正缺点和错误，领导大家搞好生产。五队贫下中农社员，对在四清、文化大革命中犯过错误的队长高广英作了具体分析：高广英四十六岁，贫农出身，从小就给地主放猪，给地主扛了十几年活，受尽了剥削压迫。解放后在党的培养教育下，光荣地加入了中国共产党，群众选他当干部，十几年来兢兢业业，一直跟党走，听毛主席的话，热心为贫下中农服务。但是，在运动中犯了一些错误，经过教育，思想认识较好，能认真检查，并表示要用实际行动改正错误。贫下中农社员看到他能认识自己的缺点和错误，又坚决改正，就谅解了他，表示坚决支持他的工作，使他很受感动。高广英表示决不辜负贫下中农社员的信任和期望，挺起腰杆干革命，为贫下中农掌权，担起革命和生产的两副重担，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。
    一连的同志还针对一些害怕缺乏经验做不好工作的干部的活思想，组织大家学习党中央的信和毛主席的有关著作，提高他们当家做主的思想，使大家认识到为贫下中农掌权是光荣的，怕，是“私”字当头，是错误的。一队队长老贫农苏国昌，经过学习，充满信心地说：“当干部是为贫下中农操心，为贫下中农掌权。只要坚决跟党走，听毛主席的话，依靠贫下中农，我就不怕群众批评。我一定要领导大家搞好生产。”
    据新华社济南十二日电　青岛驻军某部二连指战员，到驻地附近李家下庄大队支援春耕，发现有些干部不敢大胆地领导生产，他们认为，要帮助李家下庄大队贯彻党中央的指示，关键就在于帮助干部站出来，加强对春耕生产的领导。因此，决定在帮助春耕生产的同时向大队干部和贫下中农大力宣传毛主席的干部政策。他们首先组织干部、社员反复学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》和《红旗》杂志第四期社论。毛主席和党中央的关怀，使干部们深受感动。不少干部都含着热泪说：“毛主席这样关怀我们，党中央这样相信我们，我们一定要积极地出来抓革命、促生产。”大队长王维功和支部副书记李克玉本来怕群众不信任，通过学习提高了认识，表示要勇敢地站出来，和革命群众一起，永远跟着毛主席干革命，决心在春耕生产中将功补过。
    为了让毛主席的干部政策家喻户晓，深入人心，二连指战员还挨家挨户宣传毛主席的教导。广大贫下中农看到犯过错误的干部听毛主席的话，积极起来抓革命促生产，都热情地支持他们。在二连同志的帮助下，这个大队迅速健全了领导生产的班子，召开了春耕生产誓师大会，全大队春耕生产出现了一派欣欣向荣的景象。
