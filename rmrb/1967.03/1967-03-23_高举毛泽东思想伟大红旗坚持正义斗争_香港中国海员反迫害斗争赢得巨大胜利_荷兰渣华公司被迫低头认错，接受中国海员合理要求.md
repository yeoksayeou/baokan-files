Hong Kong Chinese sailors, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have waged a three-month struggle against the Dutch-owned China Navigation Company (CNCo) in Hong Kong, forcing the company to apologize and accept the sailors' reasonable demands on March 21.

The CNCo held an apology ceremony at the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Council Workers' Club in the afternoon of March 21. The company's managing director, De Han, admitted that the Dutch captain of the "Malacca Strait" ship, Van Hooi, had committed a "serious error" by shooting and injuring four Hong Kong Chinese sailors in Australia. He acknowledged that the company's attempt to suppress the sailors' protest by calling in a large number of Hong Kong British police on January 30 was wrong. He also accepted the demand that the culprit captain would never be rehired and promised that similar incidents would not happen again on CNCo ships. De Han handed over an apology letter signed by the culprit captain to the representative of the Hong Kong Seamen's Union.

The incident began on December 6 last year when the "Malacca Strait" was docked in Brisbane, Australia. The captain, Van Hooi, deliberately orchestrated the persecution of Hong Kong Chinese sailors by dismissing Liu Shugen without reason and forcing him to leave the ship immediately. When the sailors on board protested, Van Hooi called in the police to forcibly remove Liu Shugen. He then gathered five armed Dutch senior crew members and aimed their guns at the Hong Kong Chinese sailors who were protesting on the bridge. The sailors, holding hands, continued to advance, and Van Hooi immediately opened fire, injuring Li Zhihua, Wen Qinqi, Ye Song, and Huang Wangyou, who were at the front. This brutal act of fascism immediately sparked a strike and protest by all the sailors on the ship, who demanded punishment for the culprit, compensation, and guarantees that similar incidents would not happen again. By the end of December last year, the sailors returned to Hong Kong and continued their struggle, sending representatives to the CNCo to protest multiple times. The CNCo turned right into wrong, attempted to evade responsibility, and let the culprit captain go, refusing the sailors' reasonable demands. They also threatened the sailors by withholding wages and refusing to rehire them, and even called in a large number of Hong Kong British police to suppress the sailors who came to protest at the company.

In the struggle against the persecution of Hong Kong Chinese sailors by the CNCo and the culprit captain, the Hong Kong Chinese sailors established an Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee, uniting and fighting together. They formed study groups for Chairman Mao's works and, over the past three months, combined their struggle with the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Following Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," they fought with high spirits and determination. They loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations and sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, engaging in face-to-face, point-by-point struggles with the CNCo's representatives, shattering the company's plots and tricks, and finally forcing it to apologize and accept the sailors' reasonable demands.

The just struggle of the Hong Kong Chinese sailors has won the support of workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Macau, as well as sailors from the mainland. The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the Macau Federation of Trade Unions, and the All-China Seamen's Union have issued statements and messages of support. Workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Macau, as well as people from all walks of life, have held meetings or written letters to support their struggle. On March 3, a delegation from Macau, which has been at the forefront of the struggle against Portuguese imperialist persecution, visited Hong Kong. They encouraged and learned from each other, unanimously expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make it the guiding principle for all their actions. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao!" Through their struggle, the Hong Kong Chinese sailors have come to love our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought even more. They deeply feel the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "As long as we seriously study Chairman Mao's works and apply them in our struggle, we can be invincible. We are determined to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗坚持正义斗争
    香港中国海员反迫害斗争赢得巨大胜利
    荷兰渣华公司被迫低头认错，接受中国海员合理要求
    新华社香港二十二日电　香港中国海员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同荷兰在香港开设的渣华邮船公司，进行了三个多月的反迫害斗争，迫使荷兰渣华公司在二十一日当面向香港中国海员道歉认错，并签具了认错书。
    渣华公司二十一日下午二时在港九工会联合会工人俱乐部举行了道歉认错仪式。渣华公司常务董事德汉承认这个公司的“马六甲海峡号”轮船的荷籍船长范霍伊曾在澳大利亚开枪打伤四名香港中国海员是“极端错误的”，是一种敌视香港中国海员的行为；对一月三十日召来大批香港英国警察企图镇压前来抗议的海员一事承认错误；接受永不录用凶手船长的要求；保证今后在渣华公司属下的船不再发生类似事件等。他还向香港海员工会代表递交了凶手船长签具的道歉认错书。
    事情的经过是这样：去年十二月六日，“马六甲海峡号”轮停泊在澳大利亚布里斯班时，船长范霍伊曾蓄意制造迫害香港中国海员事件，将船上香港中国海员刘树根无理开除，并强迫他立即离船。船上海员表示坚决反对，范霍伊曾就召来警察将刘树根强行拉走，并纠集了五名手持手枪的荷籍高级船员，对准前来吊桥抗议的香港中国海员。海员们手挽手继续向前，范霍伊曾随即开枪打伤了站在最前列的李志华、文亲祺、叶宋、黄旺友四人，制造了严重的血案。范霍伊曾的法西斯暴行，立刻激起了全船海员的停工抗议，并向渣华公司提出惩凶、赔偿、保证今后不发生同样事件等要求。去年十二月底，海员们回到香港后，继续坚持斗争，先后多次派出代表到渣华公司提出抗议。渣华公司颠倒是非，妄图抵赖，并放走凶手船长，拒绝香港中国海员的合理要求，还用停发工资、永不录用等手段恐吓船员，甚至召来大批港英警察，企图镇压到公司抗议的海员代表。
    在反对荷兰渣华公司及凶手船长迫害香港中国海员的斗争中，香港中国海员成立了反迫害斗争委员会，团结在一起，斗争在一起。他们成立了毛主席著作学习小组，三个多月以来，一面斗争，一面活学活用毛主席著作。他们遵循毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在斗争中，他们意气风发，斗志昂扬，高声朗诵毛主席语录，高唱毛主席语录歌，同荷兰渣华公司的代表展开了面对面针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了这个公司的阴谋诡计，终于迫使它低头认错，接受了海员的合理要求。
    香港中国海员进行的正义斗争，得到了港澳各业工人和祖国海员的支持。香港工会联合会、澳门工会联合总会、中国海员工会全国委员会先后发表声明和支持电；港澳各业工人和各界同胞纷纷集会或写信支持他们的斗争。三月三日，在反对澳葡帝国主义迫害斗争中站在最前列的澳门工人组成的慰问团来港，互相鼓励，互相学习，一致坚决表示今后港澳工人要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想作为一切行动的指导方针。他们一再高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”香港中国海员经过斗争，更加热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想，他们深深地体会到毛泽东思想的无比强大的威力。他们说：“只要我们认真地学习毛主席著作，在斗争中活学活用，我们就能所向披靡，战无不胜。我们决心永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。”
