The reactionary bourgeois line of "suppressing a large number and protecting a few" is one of its components. Many facts illustrate this. Tsinghua University is a typical example controlled by the person who proposed the reactionary bourgeois line. The investigation by our magazine's reporter on the situation of the work team at Tsinghua University regarding cadre issues best illustrates this problem.

Those who proposed the reactionary bourgeois line, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, went to great lengths to shield a small number of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, aiming to suppress the vigorous proletarian cultural revolution mass movement. They dispatched a large number of work teams, directing the work teams to suppress the revolutionary masses on one hand, labeling revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries"; on the other hand, they suppressed a large number of good and relatively good cadres, labeling them as "black gangs." All of this is in opposition to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, aiming to lead the proletarian cultural revolution astray and onto the bourgeois track.

The mass criticism of the reactionary bourgeois line has achieved great victories. Now, it is particularly necessary to focus on criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line on cadre issues, criticizing the component of the reactionary bourgeois line of "suppressing a large number and protecting a few."

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary bourgeois line are diametrically opposed on cadre issues. The struggle between the two lines on cadre issues has been long-standing.

During the proletarian cultural revolution, those who proposed the reactionary bourgeois line implemented a line that was "left" in form but right in essence during the socialist education movement, implementing "suppressing a large number and protecting a few." Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of "Some Questions on the Current Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside" (the Twenty-Three Articles), which was a criticism of them. The Twenty-Three Articles pointed out that most cadres are good and relatively good; efforts should be made to gradually unite more than ninety-five percent of the cadres; a policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" should be implemented for cadres who make mistakes; the focus should be on suppressing a small number of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" also embodies this spirit, which Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of.

However, those who proposed the reactionary bourgeois line always did the opposite. They stubbornly adhered to the reactionary bourgeois position, and during the proletarian cultural revolution, they even more brazenly implemented the reactionary bourgeois line, suppressing the broad masses and the broad cadres, protecting a small number of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

A small number of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, big and small, fear the revolutionary masses the most, fear the revolutionary cadres the most, and especially fear the combination of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. Those who proposed the reactionary bourgeois line, on one hand, incited the masses to fight against cadres, and on the other hand, incited cadres to suppress the masses, attempting to achieve two birds with one stone, suppressing both the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary cadres. They attempted to make cadres unable to stand up for revolution, making the relationship between cadres and the masses seriously opposed. Therefore, in the process of achieving revolutionary "three-in-one combination," it is necessary to thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line on cadre issues.

Now, a small number of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are again attempting to pin the crime of "overthrowing all cadres" on the revolutionary youngsters, on the proletarian revolutionary factions, and on the proletarian headquarters. They pretend to care about cadres, seducing some people who do not understand the truth, inciting cadres against the revolutionary youngsters, inciting cadres against the proletarian headquarters. They maliciously attempt to sabotage the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," exclude genuine revolutionary cadres, and sabotage the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary factions. They themselves also dress up, using every means to attempt to sneak into the "three-in-one combination" leadership team, achieving capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. This is a great conspiracy that must be thoroughly exposed. The broad masses and the broad cadres must be vigilant and not be deceived.

Many cadres who were persecuted and suppressed by the reactionary bourgeois line are good and relatively good. These comrades should bravely stand up, firmly support the revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, concentrate on exposing and suppressing a small number of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and wholeheartedly join this fiery struggle. Only in this way can they unite with the revolutionary masses, contribute their strength in the struggle for power, and at the same time, transform themselves in the struggle. Do not be fooled by the book "Self-Cultivation" again. "Self-Cultivation" is a fraud, detached from the class struggle of reality, detached from revolution, detached from political struggle, not mentioning the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power, not mentioning the issue of proletarian dictatorship, advocating idealist cultivation theory, indirectly advocating bourgeois individualism, advocating servility, opposing Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Following this book to "cultivate" oneself can only result in becoming more "cultivated," more cultivated into revisionism. This book must be thoroughly criticized, and its pernicious influence must be eliminated. The criticism of this book is also an important part of the criticism of the reactionary bourgeois line.

    在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线必须批判
    《红旗》杂志评论员
     “打击一大片，保护一小撮”，是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分。许多事实，说明了这一点。清华大学是提出资产阶级反动路线的某某人亲自掌握的一个典型。本刊调查员，关于清华大学工作组对待干部问题的情况调查，最能说明这个问题。
    提出资产阶级反动路线的几个人，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，煞费苦心地包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，要把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动打下去。他们派出大量的工作组，指使工作组，一方面打击广大革命群众，把革命群众打成“反革命”；一方面打击广大干部，把大批好的和比较好的干部打成“黑帮”。这一切，都是同以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线对抗的，都是为了把无产阶级文化大革命引入歧途，纳入资产阶级的轨道。
    对资产阶级反动路线的群众性的批判，已经取得了很大的胜利。现在，特别有必要着重批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线在干部问题上，完全是针锋相对的。在干部问题上，两条路线的斗争是由来已久的。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，提出资产阶级反动路线的几个人，在社会主义教育运动中，就实行了一条形“左”而实右的路线，就实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。毛主席亲自主持制定的《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》（即二十三条），就是批判他们的。二十三条指出，大多数干部是好的和比较好的；要逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的干部；对犯错误的干部要实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策；重点是打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。毛主席亲自主持制定的《中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，也贯串着这个精神。
    可是，资产阶级反动路线的提出者，总是反其道而行之，他们顽固地坚持反动的资产阶级立场，在无产阶级文化大革命中，更加变本加厉地推行资产阶级反动路线，打击广大群众，打击广大干部，保护一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的大大小小的当权派，最害怕革命群众，最害怕革命干部，特别最害怕革命干部同革命群众相结合。提出资产阶级反动路线的几个人，一方面挑动群众斗干部，一方面挑动干部整群众，企图一箭双鵰，既整了革命群众，又整了革命干部。他们企图使干部不能站出来革命，使干部和群众的关系严重对立。因此，在实现革命的“三结合”的过程中，必须彻底批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线。
    现在，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派又企图把对干部“打倒一切”的罪名，强加在革命小将头上，强加在无产阶级革命派头上，强加在无产阶级司令部头上。他们装出关心干部的样子，拉拢一些不明真相的人，挑拨干部同革命小将的关系，挑拨干部同无产阶级司令部的关系。他们妄图破坏革命的“三结合”，排斥真正的革命干部，破坏无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。他们自己也梳装打扮起来，千方百计地妄图钻进“三结合”的领导班子，实现资本主义反革命复辟。这是一个大阴谋，必须彻底揭穿。广大的群众和广大的干部，都必须提高警惕，不要上当。
    受资产阶级反动路线迫害和打击的干部，许多是好的和比较好的。这些同志要勇敢地站出来，坚决支持革命群众，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，集中揭露和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，全身心地投入这个火热的斗争中去。这样，才能同革命群众打成一片，在夺权斗争中贡献自己的一份力量，同时，又在斗争中改造自己。千万不要再上《修养》那本书的当。《修养》这本书，是欺人之谈，脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题，宣扬唯心主义的修养论，转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，提倡奴隶主义，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。按照这本书去“修养”，只能是越养越“修”，越修养越成为修正主义。对这本书必须彻底批判，肃清它的恶劣影响。对这本书的批判，也是批判资产阶级反动路线的重要内容。
