Recently, the Indian reactionaries have repeatedly interfered in China's internal affairs, using Tibetan rebels to engage in rampant anti-China activities. On March 10, Tibetan rebels who had fled to India, with the support of the Indian government, caused trouble outside the Chinese Embassy in India. Prior to this, the traitor Dalai Lama, who is being sheltered by the Indian government, issued a so-called "statement," launching vicious attacks and slanders against the Chinese government and people, and openly inciting Tibetan people in China to rebel. This is a deliberate provocation by the Indian government against the Chinese people. On March 20, the Chinese government sent a note to the Indian government, expressing the strongest protest against such shameless provocations and interference. The Chinese people fully support the solemn position stated in the note from our government.

India has formal diplomatic relations with China. However, the Indian government harbors rebels from Tibet and uses them as tools to carry out subversive activities against China. You have repeatedly harbored and encouraged these rebels to engage in treasonous activities on Indian soil. We must ask the Indian government, do you still have the most basic principles of international relations in your eyes? Are you still prepared to fulfill your diplomatic obligations as a sovereign state?

The Indian reactionaries hate the revolution and rebirth of Tibet with a vengeance. Eight years ago, they instigated a rebellion by the upper echelons of the Tibetan reactionary clique. After this criminal rebellion was suppressed, the Indian reactionaries remained undeterred, using the Dalai Lama's traitorous clique and fleeing rebels to carry out subversive activities in Tibet. Now, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, with the support of all ethnic groups in the motherland, the Tibetan people have built a thriving socialist new Tibet. The Indian reactionaries feel even more hatred. This is determined by their reactionary class's nature of aggression.

The Indian government's use of Tibetan rebels to engage in anti-China activities is part of the anti-China wave instigated by the U.S. imperialist and Soviet revisionist leadership. The whole world knows that the Indian reactionaries live off the handouts from the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionist leaders. The Indian government, in order to please U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, has been carrying out rampant anti-China activities. It has continuously invaded our territory and airspace, creating tension on the Sino-Indian border and repeatedly provoking border incidents; it has arrested a large number of innocent Chinese residents in India, locking them up in concentration camps and prisons across the country; it has encouraged and supported the Kuomintang elements in India to engage in anti-China activities, plotting the "two Chinas" scheme; it has formed an anti-China alliance in Southeast Asia. This new anti-China farce in New Delhi shows that the Indian government is again trying to beg for new handouts from U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The anti-China farce in New Delhi reflects the increasing difficulties faced by the Indian reactionaries. The Indian government sells itself out to U.S. imperialism abroad and brutally exploits and savagely suppresses the Indian people at home. The reactionary rule in India has brought immense disasters to the Indian people, with famines year after year, corpses lying everywhere, and people living in misery. The dissatisfaction and resistance of the Indian people are growing day by day. The great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China makes the Indian reactionaries fear for their lives. It is under these circumstances that the Indian government attempts to use the anti-China farce to divert the Indian people's dissatisfaction with the reactionary rule in India and to resist the influence of the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

However, the Indian reactionaries are in vain. How can a few anti-China howls solve the deep crisis of the Indian reactionary rule? On the contrary, the more frantically the Indian government engages in anti-China activities, the more it will arouse the Indian people's dissatisfaction and opposition to the Indian reactionary rule. The Indian people want to be friends with the Chinese people. The Indian people will one day firmly grasp the fate of India in their own hands. Chairman Mao said, "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,' is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are just such a bunch of fools." The Indian reactionaries playing the role of anti-China clowns will only end up in such a predicament!

    印度反动派的反华丑剧
    本报评论员
    最近，印度反动派又连续地干涉我国内政，利用中国西藏的叛匪进行猖狂的反华活动。三月十日，西藏逃亡叛匪在印度政府的支持下，到我国驻印度大使馆门前进行捣乱。在这之前，受印度政府豢养的叛徒达赖，公然发表所谓“声明”，对我国政府和人民进行恶毒的攻击和污蔑，公开煽动我国藏族人民进行叛乱活动。这是印度政府对中国人民的蓄意挑衅。中国政府三月二十日照会印度政府，对于这种无耻的挑衅和干涉行为，提出最强烈的抗议。中国人民完全支持我国政府照会中所表明的这一严正的立场。
    印度同中国是有正式外交关系的。但是，印度政府竟然窝藏我国西藏地方的叛匪，并且利用他们作为对中国进行颠覆活动的工具。你们一而再，再而三地包庇和纵容这伙叛匪在印度土地上进行叛国活动。我们要质问印度政府，你们的眼里还有最起码的国际关系的准则吗？你们是不是还准备作为一个主权国家承担你们的外交义务呢？
    印度反动派对中国西藏的革命和新生，是恨之入骨的。八年前，它曾策动西藏上层反动集团的叛乱。而在这个罪恶的叛乱被平定之后，印度反动派仍不死心，千方百计地利用达赖叛国集团分子和逃亡的叛匪，对我国西藏地方进行颠覆活动。现在，我国藏族人民在伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，在祖国各族人民的支援下，已经建设起了欣欣向荣的社会主义的新西藏。印度反动派就百倍地感到仇恨。这是他们的反动阶级的侵略本性所决定了的。
    印度政府利用我国西藏叛匪反华，是美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团掀起的反华浪潮的一部分。全世界都知道，印度反动派是靠着美帝和苏修领导集团的施舍过日子的。印度政府为了讨好美帝国主义和苏修领导集团，一直在进行猖狂的反华活动。它连续不断地入侵我国领土、领空，在中印边境制造紧张局势，一再挑起边境事件；它逮捕大批无辜旅印华侨，把他们关进集中营和各地监狱；它纵容和支持蒋帮分子在印度进行反华活动，搞“两个中国”的阴谋；拼凑东南亚反华联盟。这一次新德里演出的反华丑剧表明，印度政府又打算向美帝国主义和苏修领导集团乞讨新的施舍了。
    新德里的反华丑剧，反映了印度反动派的日子越来越不好混。印度政府对外卖身投靠美帝国主义，对内残酷剥削和野蛮镇压印度人民。印度的反动统治，给印度人民造成了巨大的灾难，连年饥荒，饿殍遍野，民不聊生。印度人民的不满日益增长，反抗日益加剧。而中国的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响，更使印度反动派害怕得要死。正是在这种情况下，印度政府妄图利用反华丑剧来转移印度国内人民对印度反动统治的不满，抵制中国文化大革命的影响。
    但是，印度反动派是枉费心机的。几声反华的嚎叫，怎么能够解决印度反动统治的深刻危机呢？正相反，印度政府越是疯狂地反华，就越要引起印度人民对印度反动统治的不满和反对。印度人民是要同中国人民友好的。印度人民总有一天要把印度的命运牢牢地掌握在自己的手里。毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”印度反动派扮演反华的小丑，也只能落得这样的下场！
