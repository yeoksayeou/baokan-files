The frontline command for revolution and production in Huairou County, Beijing, has vigorously organized the entire county to study and implement Chairman Mao's great instruction on "grasping revolution and promoting production," as well as the Party Central Committee's letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes across the country. They have swiftly established three-level command structures at the commune, production brigade, and production team levels to strengthen leadership on the spring plowing production frontline. The entire county's spring plowing production has rapidly taken on a new look.

Today, after the *People's Daily* published the news and editorial about the establishment of the frontline command for revolution and production in this county, more than 20 revolutionary mass organizations in the county jointly held a mobilization meeting in the evening, expressing their determination to respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call and push the county's spring plowing production to new heights. The county command immediately dispatched over 100 cadres and technical personnel to various communes and brigades to support spring plowing production.

After the establishment of the frontline command for revolution and production in this county, it immediately used the authority of the proletariat to hold a county-wide radio conference, calling on the broad revolutionary masses and cadres to take action, resolutely implement Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, grasp revolution, promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production. Subsequently, it organized revolutionary cadres from county-level organs and local PLA troops to form a team of over 200 people to support spring plowing production, rushing to various communes and brigades to widely propagate Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions. In just over ten days, three-level command structures for revolution and production have been established in most communes, production brigades, and production teams across the county. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have swiftly joined the spring plowing production wave. The attendance rate and work efficiency in various communes and brigades have significantly improved, production progress has accelerated, and the quality of work has also improved. Currently, the entire county is rushing to plant early-maturing crops, and some areas that started early have nearly completed the task. In mountainous and low-lying areas, 80% of the fertilizer has been delivered to the fields; fertilizer for dry land is also being delivered quickly. Since last winter, the suburban areas of Beijing have had less rain and snow. To ensure timely sowing, the entire county is actively carrying out drought resistance and moisture conservation activities. Over 90 water conservancy projects are under construction, and existing water conservancy facilities are being repaired to improve irrigation efficiency and expand the irrigation area. The broad masses of farmers and revolutionary cadres are full of enthusiasm and confidence, determined to achieve a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

The frontline command structures for revolution and production at all levels have seriously studied the experience of the People's Liberation Army, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide spring plowing production. At the three-level cadre meetings, militia mobilization meetings, and community meetings held at the county and commune levels, they extensively studied the *Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country*, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles," and actively studied relevant editorials in *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*. The great instructions and calls from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have spread to every commune and brigade, every household, and reached the hearts of every individual. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary cadres has been ignited, and many have expressed: Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee care so much about us and believe in us; we must not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's expectations and work together with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to do a good job in spring plowing production. Many cadres have straightened their backs, actively led, and expressed their determination to create new achievements and establish new merits in spring plowing production. Some cadres who have made mistakes have also expressed their willingness to sincerely examine themselves and make up for their mistakes in spring plowing production. The PLA and revolutionary cadres dispatched to various communes, production brigades, and production teams to assist in work have all studied Chairman Mao's works and labored with the community members. They have climbed mountains and crossed rivers, endured hardships, and delivered Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions to the people's homes and fields, ensuring that everyone hears the voice of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Some farmers living in deep mountains were moved to tears when they heard the PLA and revolutionary cadres read the *Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country*. They said, "Chairman Mao cares so much about us poor and lower-middle peasants; he has spoken to our hearts. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, grasp revolution, promote production, and fight a good battle in spring plowing production." To better grasp revolution and promote production, many communes and brigades have further established and improved the system of studying Chairman Mao's works. They work during the day and engage in revolution at night, reasonably arranging time for revolution and production.
