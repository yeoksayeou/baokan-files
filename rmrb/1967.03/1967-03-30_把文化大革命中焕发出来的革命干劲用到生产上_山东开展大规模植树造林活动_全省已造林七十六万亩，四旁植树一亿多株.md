The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural Shandong have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." While ensuring a good spring plowing, they have launched a large-scale spring afforestation campaign, achieving remarkable results. Incomplete statistics show that the province has already afforested 760,000 mu (approximately 126,667 acres) and planted over 100 million trees along roadsides and fields.

In many places, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have channeled the revolutionary enthusiasm ignited during the Cultural Revolution into production, playing a leading role on the forestry front. The Li Zixiang Production Brigade of Jiangyu Commune in Linqu County was previously controlled by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, who did not close off mountains for afforestation and allowed private individuals to graze sheep, damaging water conservation and hindering agricultural development. During this Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of poor and lower-middle peasants united with revolutionary cadres to establish a forestry production team, actively closing off mountains for afforestation. They braved the cold and snow, starting to afforest on the second day of the lunar New Year. After completing the task, they promptly prepared land and cultivated seedlings over 20 mu (approximately 3.33 acres).

In some places and units that have undergone the "Four Cleanups" campaign, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have severely cracked down on the criminal activities of downed cadres who took the capitalist road and rightists who persisted in their reactionary stance, destroying trees. They have strengthened afforestation and forest protection. In the Heguo Commune of Tai'erzhuang District, Zaozhuang City, each production brigade has democratically formulated forest protection agreements and forestry production plans, and has already afforested 1,500 mu (approximately 250 acres).

The "three-in-one combination" command organs for grasping revolution and promoting production on the front lines in various places have, while ensuring good spring plowing, strengthened leadership over forestry production. Revolutionary workers in state-owned forest farms, silkworm farms, and orchards have, on the one hand, ensured good forestry production in their own units, and on the other hand, actively and voluntarily gone to nearby communes and production brigades to help with afforestation.

    把文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产上
    山东开展大规模植树造林活动
    全省已造林七十六万亩，四旁植树一亿多株
    据新华社济南二十七日电　山东农村广大贫下中农和革命干部热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在搞好春耕生产的同时开展大规模的春季植树造林活动，取得了很大成绩。据不完全统计，全省已造林七十六万亩，四旁植树一亿余株。
    许多地方的广大贫下中农和革命干部，把在文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲，用到生产上，在林业战线上发挥了主力军的作用。临朐县蒋峪公社李子行大队，过去被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所把持，不封山，不造林，留着秃山让私人放羊，破坏了水土保持，妨碍了农业生产的发展。在这次文化大革命中，贫下中农革命派团结革命群众和革命干部，建立了林业生产班子，积极封山育林。他们冒着严寒风雪，农历正月初二就上山造林。完成任务后，又不失时机地整地育苗二十多亩。
    一些经过“四清”运动的地方和单位的广大贫下中农和革命干部，狠狠打击了走资本主义道路的下台干部和坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子破坏林木的罪恶活动，加强了造林和护林工作。枣庄市台儿区贺窑公社各社队都民主制订了护林公约和林业生产规划，现在已新造林一千五百亩。
    各地“三结合”抓革命促生产第一线指挥机构，在搞好春耕生产的同时，加强了对林业生产的领导。国营林场、蚕场和果场的革命职工，一方面搞好本单位的林业生产，同时还积极主动地深入附近社队帮助植树造林。
