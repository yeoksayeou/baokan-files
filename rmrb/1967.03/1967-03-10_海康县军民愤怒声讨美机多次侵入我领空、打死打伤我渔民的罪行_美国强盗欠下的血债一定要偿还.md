The Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. Anyone who dares to impose war on us will be decisively, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilated.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 9th - Recently, revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers in Haikang County, Guangdong Province, held meetings and parades to angrily denounce the heinous crimes of American imperialist bandit aircraft repeatedly violating our airspace over the western part of Hainan Island on February 20th and 21st and indiscriminately strafing our fishing boats in international waters, killing and injuring our fishermen.

On the afternoon of February 24th, over 7,000 revolutionary masses, militiamen, and People's Liberation Army soldiers from Haikang County held a rally to denounce the American imperialists' heinous crimes. The military and civilian attendees were filled with righteous indignation, raising their fists and shouting, "Down with American imperialism!" "The American bandits owe the Chinese people a debt of blood, which must be repaid!"

At the meeting, revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic. This is a Marxist law. When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature is unchangeable. Imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher's knives, nor can they become Buddhas, until their destruction."

Following this, a representative of the Haikang County proletarian revolutionary faction spoke at the meeting. He said in great anger that the recent repeated violations of our airspace by American imperialist bandit aircraft and their indiscriminate bombing and strafing of our fishing boats are not isolated incidents. They are part of the evil conspiracy of collusion between the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionists and all reactionaries to jointly oppose China. They are inseparable from their escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam. He pointed out that the Chinese people, armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless of heaven, earth, ghosts, or gods. They can see through all the enemy's tricks. We proletarian revolutionaries, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and shatter the American imperialists' dream of occupying China. We firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation until final victory.

Yang Laishun, a victim from the Ushishi Commune Fishery Brigade, angrily denounced the crimes of the American bandit aircraft strafing our fishing boats. He said, "The American bandit aircraft can destroy our fishing boats and kill our class brothers, but they can never destroy the determination of our fishermen, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose American imperialism. We will definitely avenge our class brothers and will not rest until we annihilate American imperialism."

A representative of the revolutionary peasants said at the meeting, "The American bandit aircraft violating our airspace and killing our fishermen in international waters is a grave war provocation against us, which has aroused our utmost indignation. We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's call to seize the revolution and promote production. We will do a good job in spring plowing and production, resolutely achieve double victories in revolution and production, produce more grain to support national defense construction and the revolutionary cause of the people of the world, and make our ironclad socialist state even more solid. Let the American aggressors and all reactionaries tremble before us!"

The representative of the stationed People's Liberation Army solemnly warned American imperialism: The Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. Anyone who dares to impose war on us will be decisively, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilated. He said, "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is the greatest war preparedness. We, the People's Liberation Army, are the strong pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the revolutionary leftist masses. We will actively support and assist the proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power from the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road within the Party. In defending the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we will make new contributions. We will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, maintain high vigilance at all times, and firmly implement the instructions of the Central Military Commission to seize the revolution, promote war preparedness, promote work, and promote production. We will firmly guard our battle positions and be ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade."

Recently, the Ushishi Commune, where the fishermen killed and injured by the American bandit aircraft belong, also held a rally and parade to denounce the crimes of American imperialism.

    海康县军民愤怒声讨美机多次侵入我领空、打死打伤我渔民的罪行
    美国强盗欠下的血债一定要偿还
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，谁要胆敢把战争强加在我们身上，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把他们消灭掉。
    新华社广州九日电　广东省海康县革命群众和人民解放军指战员最近举行集会、游行，愤怒声讨美帝国主义强盗飞机在二月二十日和二十一日多次侵入我海南岛西部领空，并在公海上向我渔船疯狂扫射打死打伤我渔民的滔天罪行。
    二月二十四日下午，海康县无产阶级革命派、民兵和驻地人民解放军指战员七千多人，举行了声讨美帝滔天罪行大会。到会的军民义愤填膺，振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国强盗欠下中国人民的血债，一定要偿还！”
    会上，革命群众和人民解放军指战员高声朗读毛主席语录：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”
    接着，海康县无产阶级革命派代表在会上发言。他无比愤怒地说，美帝国主义的强盗飞机最近连续侵犯我国领空，疯狂轰炸扫射我国渔船，这决不是偶然的事件，这是它和苏联现代修正主义及一切反动派勾结一起联合反华的罪恶阴谋的组成部分；是同它加紧扩大侵略越南的战争分不开的。他指出，用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，是天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕的，是能够识透敌人的种种阴谋诡计的。我们无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一定把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，砸碎美帝国主义妄图侵占中国的美梦。我们最坚决地支持越南人民抗美救国斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    乌石公社渔业大队受害者杨来顺在大会上愤怒地控诉了美国强盗飞机扫射我渔船的罪行。他说，美国强盗飞机能炸烂我们的渔船，炸死我们的阶级兄弟，但永远也炸不掉我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的渔民反对美帝国主义的决心。我们一定要为阶级兄弟报仇，不消灭美帝国主义决不罢休。
    革命农民代表在会上说，美国强盗飞机侵犯我国领空，并在公海上杀害我渔民，这是对我们最严重的战争挑衅，激起了我们无比的愤怒。我们一定要坚决响应毛主席和党中央抓革命、促生产的伟大号召，把春耕生产搞好，誓夺革命、生产双胜利，多打粮食支援国防建设和世界人民的革命事业，使我们铁打的社会主义江山更加巩固。让美国侵略者和一切反动派在我们面前发抖吧！
    驻地人民解放军代表在会上严正警告美帝国主义：用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，谁要胆敢把战争强加在我们身上，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把他们消灭掉。他说，无产阶级文化大革命就是最大的战备。我们人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。我们坚决响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持革命左派广大群众的伟大号召，积极支持援助无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的斗争，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命中，做出新的贡献。我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，时刻保持高度警惕，坚决贯彻中共中央军委抓革命、促战备、促工作、促生产的指示，坚守战斗岗位，随时准备消灭胆敢来犯的一切敌人。
    被美国强盗飞机炸死炸伤的渔民所属的乌石公社，最近也举行了声讨美帝罪行大会和游行。
