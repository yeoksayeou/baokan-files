The criticism of the masses is the greatest care for cadres
Yuetan Brigade cadres correctly handle the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants and actively lead spring production

“To grasp revolution and promote production” is the policy put forward by our great leader Chairman Mao. Whether it can be resolutely carried out is a severe test for every cadre. The majority of cadres in Yuetan Brigade, Yuetan Commune, Yanshi County, Henan Province, have passed the test and tempered themselves during the Cultural Revolution, promoting their own ideological revolutionization and thus driving the development of agricultural production.

Welcoming the masses' criticism,
Helping others to correctly handle the masses' criticism

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside, some cadres in Yuetan Brigade seriously studied the “Three Articles” and the “Sixteen Points” personally formulated by Chairman Mao, realizing that leading cadres must be bold and execute Chairman Mao’s great directive of “grasp revolution and promote production.” On one hand, they must correctly handle the masses' criticism of themselves; on the other hand, they must actively lead the current spring production.

On the basis of raising ideological awareness, the Party branch secretary of the brigade, Liu Yingxiang (a delegate to the National People's Congress and a first-class labor model in Henan Province), took the lead in going to the forefront of production. While boldly leading spring production, he made full use of production gaps to visit various production teams and listen to the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants. Liu Yingxiang said: “Whether one is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary depends on whether one can firmly stand on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants and correctly handle the masses' criticism.”

The fourteenth production team had a cadre who misused public funds without consulting the masses. The masses had raised this issue to the Party branch, but Liu Yingxiang did not handle it in time. The masses criticized Liu Yingxiang, saying: “If you do not handle this issue, you are supporting cadres in wasting money.” Liu Yingxiang thought this criticism was correct, so he used production gaps to make a self-criticism to the masses. Most of the masses were satisfied. The head of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association in the fourteenth production team, Liu Zazhi, was very moved and said: “I have no personal grudge against you; I am not trying to push you down, but rather hoping that you will pay more attention to educating cadres in the future.” This made Liu Yingxiang deeply realize that as long as one sincerely makes a self-criticism, the masses will forgive them. Therefore, whenever the masses raised correct opinions, Liu Yingxiang actively corrected them. For example, when the masses criticized the Party branch for not caring enough about the poor and lower-middle peasants, Liu Yingxiang and other cadres visited various teams to investigate and help the poor, discovering that some poor and lower-middle peasants lacked coal for heating, and quickly solved the problem.

During labor, Liu Yingxiang found that many cadres in the production teams still did not understand the Cultural Revolution and could not humbly accept the masses' criticism, having various burdens in their minds and thus unable to fully play their role in leading production. Liu Yingxiang and some brigade cadres actively helped them study Chairman Mao’s works and solve ideological problems. The head of the third production team, Liu Tai'an, did not handle the year-end distribution well last year. The masses criticized him, but he thought it was personal revenge, and his production enthusiasm was somewhat dampened. Liu Yingxiang pointed out his wrong attitude and inspired him to study the “Three Articles.” Chairman Mao taught: “Communists must be ready at all times to defend the truth because any truth is in the interests of the people; Communists must be ready at all times to correct errors because any error runs counter to the interests of the people.” This sentence hit Liu Tai'an’s sore spot. He thought, as a Communist, he must resolutely follow Chairman Mao’s words and correct mistakes. He did not handle the year-end distribution properly, which was wrong in itself, so why could he not accept the masses' criticism? After realizing his mistake, he sincerely made a self-criticism to the masses and immediately changed his attitude towards leading production. In the past, when the brigade asked him to allocate labor to basic construction projects, he did not care, but now he proactively sent people pushing carts to participate. Finding that the progress of wheat irrigation was relatively slow, he led by example, encouraging the members to work harder.

Removing personal interests, not yielding to wrong opinions

In the Cultural Revolution, how to show one's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line? The cadres of this brigade believed that correctly handling the masses' criticism of oneself and sincerely correcting mistakes is one aspect. A more important aspect is actively leading spring production.

Since the Cultural Revolution, the masses have raised many opinions about Liu Yingxiang, holding many meetings (all during production gaps). After each meeting, Liu Yingxiang always suggested that the person presiding over the meeting, while the masses had not dispersed, seize the opportunity to arrange the current production tasks. Finally, he kept the production team cadres and, based on the masses' opinions, discussed with everyone the measures to complete the tasks. The next day, he led the masses to complete the current production tasks as usual.

Why did Liu Yingxiang dare to actively lead production when receiving criticism? As he himself said: “No matter how many criticisms the masses raise against me, I am not afraid; if there are mistakes, I will correct them! If because of receiving the masses' criticism, one does not dare to lead production, this would violate Chairman Mao’s policy of ‘grasp revolution and promote production.’”

Liu Yingxiang’s correct attitude towards handling the masses' criticism moved many cadres, and they said: “As long as the masses trust us, we will not give up the responsibility of leading production for a single day!”

During the Cultural Revolution, it was inevitable that the masses had different views on certain issues. At that time, someone proposed organizing labor based on different views to carry out production. This would inevitably disrupt the production order and be detrimental to production. At that time, the masses were raising opinions to the cadres, and not accepting this opinion would the masses misunderstand, thinking that the cadres were not humble? The brigade cadres believed that a revolutionary must dare to take responsibility for collective production, and anything detrimental to collective production should be opposed, and one must not be afraid and yield to wrong opinions. Later, through their explanations and persuasion, the comrade who raised this opinion quickly gave up his opinion. This incident once again educated the cadres: as long as one dares to take responsibility for collective production, the masses will eventually clarify the right and wrong.

Actively applying Chairman Mao’s works to solve production problems

In the past, the cadres of this brigade did not seriously study and apply Chairman Mao’s works in leading production, and there were many opinions from the masses. The brigade cadres accepted the masses' criticism and seriously corrected it. For example, when formulating the production plan this year, they first studied Chairman Mao’s works. Chairman Mao taught: “We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If one doubts these two principles, then nothing can be done.” They realized that formulating the production plan must also follow the mass line, believe in the masses, and rely on the masses. The plan for planting trees along the riverbank was carried out under this ideological guidance. According to the collective research of the brigade cadres, this year’s plan for planting trees along the riverbank, due to the cold weather, the attendance rate could not be too high, planning to plant 40,000 trees. However, when this plan was discussed with the masses, the masses realized that planting trees along the riverbank could protect the riverbank land, prevent water, sand, and silt, and increase sideline income, and everyone’s enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. According to the actual situation, the plan for planting trees was changed to 60,000 trees. To complete this plan, everyone was not afraid of the cold and went to the riverbank to plant trees. As a result, the plan was overfulfilled, reaching more than 61,000 trees.

Wheat is the main grain of this brigade. Managing the wheat fields well is a very important task. Some members saw that the wheat was planted well this year and developed a complacent and relaxed attitude towards managing the wheat fields. The cadres and the masses studied Chairman Mao’s works together: “We must learn to look at problems comprehensively, not only seeing the positive side but also the negative side.” Chairman Mao’s words prompted everyone to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the wheat: this year’s wheat was indeed planted well, but this year the weather was dry, cold early, and the temperature was low, which was not conducive to wheat growth. To make everyone better understand this problem, the cadres pulled out some poorly growing wheat seedlings for everyone to see. These seedlings, due to the influence of bad weather, showed problems such as shallow roots and few rootlets. At this time, some people felt discouraged: “Previously, we always thought that this year’s wheat could yield 700-800 jin per mu, but looking at this situation, if it can reach last year’s yield, it would be good (last year’s yield was more than 600 jin per mu).” Aiming at this thought, the cadres and the masses studied Chairman Mao’s works together. Chairman Mao said: “Our comrades must see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage.” Thus, everyone became spirited again, with the confidence to strive for a wheat bumper harvest, actively watering and fertilizing the wheat. Now the wheat is growing well.

A spring production high tide has been set off

The cadres of this brigade resolutely carry out Chairman Mao’s great call to “grasp revolution and promote production,” obtaining the support and endorsement of the revolutionary faction and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. The revolutionary faction and the cadres worked together to organize a relatively complete production leadership team, ensuring that the production of the entire brigade proceeds normally.

The enthusiasm aroused by the Cultural Revolution has been poured into production, already achieving good results: the entire brigade’s 1,020 mu of wheat has been watered three times and fertilized twice, and the seedlings are growing vigorously; part of the autumn fields has been deeply plowed, laying the foundation for increasing autumn grain production.

### 群众的批评是对干部最大的爱护  岳滩大队干部正确对待贫下中农意见积极领导春耕生产

    群众的批评是对干部最大的爱护
    岳滩大队干部正确对待贫下中农意见积极领导春耕生产
    “抓革命，促生产”是我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的方针，能否坚决地贯彻执行，对每个干部都是一场严峻的考验。河南偃师县岳滩公社岳滩大队的绝大多数干部在文化大革命中经受了考验和锻炼，促进了自己的思想革命化，因而推动了农业生产的发展。
    欢迎群众对自己的批评，
    帮助别人正确对待群众的批评
    农村无产阶级文化大革命刚开始，岳滩大队的一些干部就认真地学习了“老三篇”和毛主席亲自制订的“十六条”，认识到领导干部必须“敢”字当头，执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示。一方面，要正确对待群众对自己的批评，另一方面，要积极领导好当前的春耕生产。
    在提高思想觉悟的基础上，大队党支部书记刘应祥（全国人民代表大会代表、河南省特等劳动模范）首先挺身而出，在深入生产第一线，大胆领导春耕生产的同时，充分利用生产空隙，到各生产队听取贫下中农的意见。刘应祥说：“是真革命还是假革命，就看能不能坚定地站在贫下中农一边，正确对待群众的批评。”
    十四生产队有个干部乱用公款，事前没有和群众商量，群众曾经向党支部提出这个问题，但是刘应祥没有及时处理。群众批评刘应祥说：“你不处理这个问题，就是支持干部乱花钱。”刘应祥认为这个意见提得对，就利用生产空隙，向群众作了检查，多数群众表示满意。十四生产队贫协组长刘扎子很感动地说：“我不是对你有啥成见，不是要把你推倒，而是希望你今后更加注意教育干部。”这使刘应祥深深体会到，有了错误，只要认真检查，群众是会谅解的。因此凡是群众提出的正确意见，刘应祥就积极地加以改正。比如：群众批评党支部对贫下中农关心不够，刘应祥就和其他干部深入各队访贫问苦，发现有的贫下中农缺煤烧，便很快加以解决。
    在劳动中，刘应祥发现有不少生产队的干部对文化大革命还很不理解，对群众的批评，不能虚心接受，思想上存在这样那样的包袱，因而不能充分发挥领导生产的作用。刘应祥和一些大队干部就积极帮助他们学习毛主席著作，解决思想问题。第三生产队队长刘太安，去年处理年终分配时，没有很好掌握政策。群众对他提出批评，他认为是私人报复，生产情绪有些低落。刘应祥指出他的态度不对，并启发他学习“老三篇”。毛主席教导说：“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合于人民利益的；共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。”这句话，正说到刘太安的痛处。他想，自己是个共产党员，要坚决听毛主席的话，有错就改。自己没有把年终分配处理妥当，本来就不对，为什么听不得群众批评？他认识到自己的错误后，诚恳地向群众作了检查，并且马上改变了领导生产的态度。过去，大队要他派工投入基本建设工程，他不管，现在他主动派人推着车子去参加。发现小麦浇水进度比较缓慢，他就以身作则带着社员加油干。
    去掉私心，不迁就错误意见
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，怎样表明自己无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线？这个大队的干部认为，正确对待群众对自己的批评，认真检查错误，这是一个方面。更重要的一个方面，是积极地把春耕生产领导起来。
    文化大革命以来，群众对刘应祥提了许多意见，开了许多次会（都在生产空闲时间进行），每次大会结束，刘应祥总是建议主持大会的同志，趁着群众没有散，抓紧布置当前的生产任务。末了，他又把生产队干部留下，根据群众的意见，和大家研究完成任务的各项措施。第二天，他照往常一样积极地带领群众去完成当前的生产任务。
    刘应祥在受到批评时为什么还敢于积极领导生产呢？正如他自己所说：“不管群众对我提出多少批评，我都不怕，有错误就改正嘛！如果因为受到群众批评，就不敢去领导生产，这就违背了毛主席提出的‘抓革命，促生产’的方针。”
    刘应祥这样正确对待群众批评的态度，感动了许多干部，他们说：“只要群众信任，我们干一天，就一天不能放弃领导生产的责任！”
    在文化大革命中，群众对某些问题的看法不一致，是难免的，当时却有人提出要按照不同的观点来组织劳动力，进行生产。这样做，必然要打乱生产秩序，对生产不利。当时，群众正在给干部提意见，不接受这个意见会不会引起群众的误解，以为干部不虚心？大队干部认为，一个革命者，要敢于对集体生产负责，凡是不利于集体生产的事，就应该反对，决不能“怕”字当头，迁就错误的意见。后来，经过他们的解释说服，提出这个意见的同志很快放弃了自己的意见。这件事又一次教育了干部：只要敢于对集体生产负责，群众终究会把是非弄清楚的。
    活学活用毛主席著作，解决生产问题
    过去，这个大队的干部在领导生产中，没有认真活学活用毛主席著作，群众意见较多。大队干部接受群众批评，并认真改正。例如：今年制订生产计划时，他们首先学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”他们认识到，制订生产计划，也必须贯彻群众路线，相信群众，依靠群众。河滩植树造林计划就是在这种思想指导下进行的。根据大队干部集体研究，今年河滩植树造林，因天气寒冷，出勤率不可能太高，计划植树造林四万棵。可是这个计划交给群众讨论时，群众认识到河滩植树造林，既能保护河滩造地，又能防水、防沙、防淤地和增加副业收入，大家的积极性空前高涨，根据实际情况，把植树造林计划改为六万棵。为了完成这个计划，大家不怕天寒地冻，都到河滩植树造林。结果，超计划完成，达到六万一千多棵。
    小麦，是这个大队的主产粮食。把麦田管理好是一件非常重要的事情。有些社员看见今年小麦种的很好，产生了麻痹自满思想，放松了麦田管理。干部就和群众一起学习毛主席著作，“我们必须学会全面地看问题，不但要看到事物的正面，也要看到它的反面。”毛主席的这段话，促使大家对小麦进行全面分析：今年小麦确实种的很好，但是今年天气干，冷得早，气温低，对小麦生长不利。为了让大家更好地认识这个问题，干部拔了一些生长不好的麦苗给大家看。这些麦苗由于天气不好的影响，出现扎根浅，根须少等毛病。这时，有些人感到泄气：“以前总以为今年小麦能打七八百斤，看这个样子，能达到去年的产量就不错（去年亩产六百多斤）。”针对这种思想，干部又和群众一起学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”于是大家都振作起精神，抱着争取小麦丰收的信心，积极给小麦浇水、施肥。现在小麦长势很好。
    掀起了春耕生产高潮
    这个大队的干部坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，得到革命派和广大贫下中农的支持和拥护。革命派和干部同心协力，组织了一个比较健全的生产领导班子，使全大队的生产得到正常进行。
    人们从文化大革命激发起来的干劲，贯注到生产中去，已经获得很好的成绩：全大队一千零二十亩小麦，已浇了三次水，追了两次肥，麦苗长得茁壮；深翻了一部分秋地，为秋粮增产打下了基础。
