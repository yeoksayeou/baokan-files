In the current struggle situation, what kind of organizational form should the revolutionary masses of the proletariat adopt to organize the revolutionary forces? The Guizhou Cotton Mill has created a good form of great alliance, organizing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from the bottom up by departments into a unified revolutionary organization, which has played a very good role in promoting both revolution and production.

The experience of the Guizhou Cotton Mill is excellent and worthy of serious study and research by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in various places.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything for the victory of the front line, organizational tasks must be subordinate to political tasks."

In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat resolutely broke through the barriers set up by the bourgeois reactionary line, broke through the boundaries between units, departments, and levels, and revolutionary students and teachers carried out nationwide tours, while workers and peasants also toured within the city and within production teams during their spare time, igniting the blazing fires of the Cultural Revolution everywhere. Revolutionary forces of the proletariat formed and grew stronger in the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and made immortal contributions to the upsurge of the Cultural Revolution.

Currently, the movement has developed to the stage of decisive battle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The organizational form of the revolutionary forces of the proletariat must adapt to the requirements of the new combat tasks. Within a single unit, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have common goals of struggle, common tasks of criticism, struggle, and reform, and common tasks of "grasp revolution, promote production." However, if they are not organized into a unified whole with coordinated steps, but belong to many independent systems of combat organizations, this is not conducive to the completion of common tasks, and it is also easy to foster sectarianism and cliquism, which is not conducive to the ideological revolution of the members of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Therefore, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in a single unit should unite in a unified revolutionary organization, which is very necessary and beneficial for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to seize and hold power.

In the process of implementing the great alliance, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Guizhou Cotton Mill have done serious political and ideological work. They proposed and implemented the principle of "revolution does not distinguish between early and late, and organization does not distinguish between large and small," uniting all revolutionary masses and revolutionary mass organizations. This is a very important experience.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Guizhou Cotton Mill said well: Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the great alliance. Revolutionary comrades of the proletariat in various places should, like the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Guizhou Cotton Mill, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, carry out "open rectification," thoroughly criticize and repudiate the "private" character, and correct sectarianism, cliquism, factionalism, and anarchism and other non-proletarian ideological tendencies. On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, they should unite and win a decisive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

    无产阶级革命派大联合的好形式
    在当前的斗争形势下，无产阶级革命派应该采用什么样的组织形式来组织革命队伍呢？贵阳棉纺厂创造了大联合的好形式，自下而上地按部门把无产阶级革命派组织在统一的革命组织中，对革命和生产都起了很好的促进作用。
    贵阳棉纺厂的经验好得很，值得各地无产阶级革命派认真学习和研究。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切为了前线的胜利，组织任务须服从于政治任务。”
    在文化革命初期，无产阶级革命派坚决打破资产阶级反动路线设置的层层障碍，打破单位之间、部门之间、系级之间的界限，革命师生实行了全国大串连，工农群众也在生产之余在本市、在社队之间进行串连，到处点燃了文化大革命的熊熊烈火，一支支无产阶级革命派队伍在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作坚决斗争中形成壮大起来了，为掀起文化革命的高潮，立下了不朽的功勋。
    目前，运动发展到向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的决战阶段，无产阶级革命派队伍的组织形式必须适应新的战斗任务的要求。在一个单位中，无产阶级革命派有着共同的斗争目标，有着共同的斗、批、改的任务，有着共同的“抓革命，促生产”的任务；但是，如果他们在组织上不是形成一个步调整齐一致的整体，而是分属于许多自成系统的战斗组织，这就不利于共同任务的完成，而且还容易助长小团体主义、宗派主义，不利于无产阶级革命派成员的思想革命化。因此，一个单位的无产阶级革命派，联合在一个统一的革命组织中，对于无产阶级革命派夺权和掌权，是十分必要的，十分有利的。
    贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派，在实行大联合的过程中，认真地做了政治思想工作。他们提出并且实行“革命不分先后，组织不分大小”的原则，把一切革命群众、革命群众组织联合起来。这是很重要的经验。
    贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派说得好：毛泽东思想是大联合的灵魂。各地无产阶级革命战士，都要象贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，实行“开门整风”，大破“私”字，纠正宗派主义、小团体主义、山头主义和无政府主义等非无产阶级思想倾向，在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
