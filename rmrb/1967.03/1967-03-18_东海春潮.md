It was deep into the night, and only the waves were still making a rhythmic sound.

Platoon leader Li Jun was tossing and turning, unable to sleep. Tonight, Old Li had gone to convey Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's message to the members of the Donggang Production Brigade. The news spread quickly, and all the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Donggang Brigade came, except for the head of the second production team, Zhou Erhu. Someone reported, "Comrade Zhou is sick!"

After returning to the barracks, Old Li kept thinking about this. He lay in bed, pondering: I see Old Zhou every few days, so how come I didn't know he was sick? Is it because I don't care enough about the masses? Then he thought, the problem might not be that simple. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Old Zhou stood tall and straight, even posting big-character posters against himself. But ever since a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road blew a cold wind of "every cadre must be criticized," Old Zhou's spirits had sagged.

"Can't let him really fall ill! I'll go see him tomorrow!" Li Jun thought to himself.

The next day happened to be a joint military-civilian defense day. The company responded to Chairman Mao's great call to support spring plowing in the Donggang Brigade. Along the way, they beat drums and sang loudly. The peasants working in the fields saw the soldiers and greeted them as if they were seeing family.

Li Jun had come specifically to find Comrade Zhou. Seeing that Old Zhou was not in the fields, he exchanged a few words with the third squad leader and rushed straight to Old Zhou's house.

Li Jun reached the courtyard of Comrade Zhou's house and suddenly heard a sound of "patter patter." He looked far away: Hey! Wasn't that Old Zhou? He was repairing agricultural tools for the team!

"Old Zhou! I really thought you were sick!" Platoon Leader Li called out happily to Old Zhou.

Old Zhou continued with his work, looking a bit unnatural as he said, "I intended to rest a bit, but these tasks really can't be delayed!"

Li Jun secretly praised him: Not bad! He's a good material. Though he has some knots in his thoughts, he still has the collective in his heart! I must really mobilize his enthusiasm!

He acted as if nothing was wrong, taking out a letter from his pocket and saying, "These days, the company has been encouraging everyone to write red family letters, and I've written one too. It's to my brother. Let me read it to you and see if it's okay?"

Before Old Zhou could respond, Platoon Leader Li started reading the letter. As soon as he finished, Old Zhou asked, "Old Li, to whom did you write this letter?"

"To my brother."

"Where is your brother?"

"In our hometown, he's the team leader. The other day, I received a letter from my sister saying he has some burdens on his mind, so I wrote a letter to encourage him."

"That's why it sounded like you were writing to me! Old Li, just say what you have to say!" The impatient Old Zhou couldn't hold back any longer.

Li Jun said, "Then why do you hide things from me?"

"Alright, I'll tell you straight," Old Zhou opened his heart: "Old Li, go help me reflect, change this team leader of mine!"

"Change shifts?"

"You know, I, Zhou Erhu, am just a rough man. If you ask me to carry soil or dig the ground, I can manage; but if you ask me to be a cadre, I have little education, poor abilities, and recently my stomach problems have been acting up..."

Li Jun saw that Old Zhou had stopped talking, so he continued, "Today, I didn't come to talk about this. Come on, let's do things according to the old rules, and let's study a section of the 'Three Articles' together!"

He opened the shining red book of quotations and led Old Zhou in reciting a passage: "A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as he has this spirit, he is a person of noble character, of pure moral character, of lofty sentiments, of disinterestedness, and of great dedication to the people."

Then Li Jun said, "Last year, the leadership kept me as a cadre. At first, I had no experience in work, and whenever I encountered specific difficulties, I had problems in my thoughts. At that time, the political instructor read this passage to me, and the more I thought about it, the more I felt Chairman Mao's words were right. After that, I started studying the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' every day. The more I studied, the more I remembered, and slowly, the five golden characters 'Serve the People' were engraved in my heart, never to be forgotten. I am from a mountain village, with little education and poor abilities, but with these five characters in my heart, I am not afraid of any difficulties!"

The spring sun warmed their bodies. Platoon Leader Li's heartfelt words warmed Old Zhou's heart even more.

Li Jun saw that Old Zhou's mood had changed significantly, so he continued, "What are you thinking about? Do you know that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have sent us a letter?"

"Chairman Mao wrote us a letter?!" Old Zhou opened his eyes wide in surprise and joy.

"Indeed! He cares for us so much! Look!" Platoon Leader Li handed Old Zhou a newspaper with the title "Message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" and said, "Chairman Mao encourages you to go to the front line of spring plowing!"

"Really?" Old Zhou snatched the newspaper and read it several times. He was so excited that he opened his "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gazing deeply at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the cover. He couldn't hold back his excitement and softly called out, "Chairman Mao..."

Old Li helped Old Zhou for a day, and as they were about to finish work, he said to Old Zhou, "Let's go to the seaside for a walk!"

They walked silently, listening to the sound of the spring tide of the East China Sea surging towards the shore. After walking a distance on the seawall, they sat down. Suddenly, Old Li picked up a seashell brought by the waves and asked, "Old Zhou, what do you call this here?"

"Seashell." Old Zhou replied.

"Is it delicious?"

"When I was young, we couldn't afford to cook, so we picked these to eat!" Old Zhou, as he spoke, suddenly remembered his childhood of picking seashells in hardship: how his parents had drowned themselves in the sea under the pressure of the landlord's rent and debts; how his seven-year-old little sister had been swept away by the waves while picking seashells; how he had begged for six whole years with his sister, using a begging stick... Thinking of this, Old Zhou turned his head and secretly wiped away the tears that had welled up in his eyes.

Li Jun saw that Old Zhou was so sad, and his heart ached. After Old Zhou's mood had calmed down a bit, he said, "Old Zhou, why did we suffer in the past? It's because the power was not in our hands! Today, we, the people, have taken the throne. We must firmly grasp the power in the hands of the proletariat, so we won't suffer again! If we stop the revolution and lie down without doing the revolution, how can we face Chairman Mao?"

Old Zhou listened intently to Li Jun's words, and his face became more and more bright...

The spring tide of the East China Sea was surging, and the rolling waves rushed towards the shore. Old Zhou gazed at the boundless East China Sea, his heart surging like the waves. He excitedly said to Li Jun, "Old Li, I will revolutionize to the end!"

    东海春潮
    上海戏剧学院一红卫兵
    夜深了，只有海浪还在发着一阵阵的拍击声。
    一排长李军翻来复去睡不着觉。
    今天晚上，老李给东港大队社员传达毛主席和党中央给贫下中农和各级干部的信去了。消息一传开，东港大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部全都来了，唯独第二生产队队长周二虎缺席。有人反映：“周队长病了！”
    老李回营房以后，一直惦念着这事儿，躺在床上左思右想：我跟老周三天两天见面，他病了我怎么一点儿不知道呢？是不是自己对群众不够关心呀？再一想，问题可不那么简单。在无产阶级文化大革命刚开始时，老周的腰板挺得硬硬的，还给自己贴了大字报。可是，自从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派刮出了一股“干部人人要整”的阴风之后，老周的情绪就有点低落了。
   “可不能让他真的病’了呀！明儿看看他去！”李军这样想。
    第二天，正好是个军民联防日。连队响应毛主席的伟大号召，去东港大队支援春耕生产。一路上，敲锣打鼓，歌声嘹亮。正在田头劳动的社员们见了解放军同志，就象见了亲人似的，老远就打起招呼来了。
    李军是存心来找周队长的，见老周不在田里，向三班长交代了几句，便直往老周家里跑。
    李军走到周队长家场头上，忽然听到一阵“劈劈啪啪”的声音。他远远一瞧：嘿！那不正是老周吗？他正在为队里整修着农具呢！
   “老周！我还真以为你病了呢！”李排长冲着老周高兴地喊了起来。
    老周做着手里的活计，显得有些不自然地说：“本来想休息一下，可是这些活实在误不下啊！”
    李军暗暗赞许：不错！是块好料子。虽说思想有疙瘩，可他心里还搁着集体呢！一定得好好把他的积极性给调动起来！
    他装作没事的样子，从口袋里掏出一封信来说：“这几天，连队发动大伙写红色家书，我也写了一封，是写给我哥哥的。我把它念给你听听，看这样写行不？”
    没等老周吱声，李排长就把家书念开了。信一念完，老周就问：“老李，你这信是写给谁的？”
    “写给我哥的。”
    “你哥在哪？”
    “在咱家乡当队长。前天，接到我妹妹来信，说他近来有些思想包袱，要我写封信去开导开导他。”
    “那我怎么听着好象是写给我似的！老李，有啥话就干脆说吧！”急性子的老周有点憋不住了。
    李军说：“那你为啥有话瞒着我不说呢？”
    “好，我就把话跟你直说了吧！”老周把心里话掏了出来：“老李，你去帮我反映反映，把我这个队长换了吧！”
    “换班？”
    “你也知道，我二虎生来是个大老粗，你要叫我挑担土坌块地，倒还能来两下子；你要叫我当干部，我文化低，能力差，加上近来胃病又在发作……”
    李军见老周住了口，就接着说：“今天我来不是找你谈这个事的。来，还按老章程办事，咱俩再来共同学一段‘老三篇’吧！”
    打开红光闪闪的语录本，李排长领着老周念起了这么一段语录：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”
    接着李军又说：“去年，领导上把我留作干部，刚上来我工作没经验，一碰到具体困难，思想问题就来了。当时，指导员给我念了这段语录，我越想越觉得毛主席的话说得对，以后我就天天学起《毛主席语录》来。学得多了，记得也牢了，慢慢地，‘为人民服务’这五个金光闪闪的大字就象刻在心头上似的，一刻也不会忘记了。我是山窝窝里出来的，文化低，能力差，可是心中有了这五个字，再大的困难也不怕啦！”
    春天的太阳晒得人浑身暖洋洋的。李排长这一席贴心话可说得老周的心更暖。
    李军看到老周的情绪有了明显的变化，便接着说：“你在想啥呀？毛主席、党中央给我们来了信你还不知道吧？”
    “毛主席给我们写信？！”老周又惊又喜地睁大了眼睛。
    “可不！他老人家才关心我们哩！瞧！”李排长把一张印有《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》的报纸递给老周说：“毛主席他老人家鼓励你走上春耕生产第一线呢！”
    “真的？”老周抢过报纸，一口气念了几遍以后，激动地打开了《毛主席语录》，深情地看着封面上的毛主席像，他抑制不住内心的激动，抬起头来轻轻地喊了一声：“毛主席呵！……” 
    老李帮着老周拾掇了一天，快到收工时，对老周说：“我们到海边去走走吧！”
    他们默不作声地走着，静听着东海涨潮的浪涛声，在海埂上走了一段之后，便就地坐了下来。忽然，老李拣到一只被海浪卷上来的海蚬子，于是就问：
    “老周，你们这儿叫它什么？”
    “海蚬子。”老周回答。
    “好吃嘛？”
    “小时候，家里烧不起饭，尽拾它去吃呵！”老周说着说着，一下想起了自己拣海蚬子的苦难的童年：父母怎样在地主的催租逼债下投海自尽，七岁的小妹妹怎样在拣蚬子时被海浪卷走；自己怎样跟着姐姐拄着讨饭棍讨了整整六年饭……想到这里，老周掉过头去，偷偷地把噙在眼里的泪水擦去。
    李军看到老周那么难过，心里也酸痛酸痛的。等到老周的情绪稍微平静之后，他才说：“老周，咱们穷人以前为什么受苦？那是因为政权不在我们手里！今天，我们人民坐了江山，只有把政权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级手里，才不会再受二遍苦啊！我们要是停下革命的步伐，躺下来不干革命，怎么对得起毛主席他老人家啊！”
    老周聚精会神地听着李军的话，脸色越来越开朗起来……。
    东海涨潮了，滚滚的春潮涌向海岸。老周凝望着无边无际的东海，心情象波涛一样起伏不停。他激动地对李军说：“老李，我要革命到底！”
