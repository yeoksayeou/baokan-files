Over two thousand protesters gathered today outside the U.S. Embassy in London, chanting slogans to protest against the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam. People also formed an eight-mile-long protest line between the U.S. Embassy, the "embassy" of the puppet regime in South Vietnam, and the British Foreign Office. The demonstration lasted for three and a half hours.

Authorities dispatched police to stand guard in front of the U.S. Embassy. However, the protesters were undeterred, shouting, “Yankee murderers, get out!” “We want the National Liberation Front (of South Vietnam), not the Yankees!” “Johnson, how many young people did you kill this Friday?”

    抗议美帝侵略越南
    伦敦两千多人举行示威
    据新华社伦敦二十五日电　两千多名示威者今天在这里的美国大使馆外面高呼口号，抗议美国侵略越南的战争。人们还在美国大使馆、南越傀儡政权“大使馆”以及英国外交部之间排成了八英里长的抗议队伍。示威持续了三个半小时。
    当局调来了警察，在美国大使馆前戒备。但是示威者毫不畏惧，高呼：“美国佬杀人犯滚出去！”“要（越南南方）民族解放阵线，不要美国佬！”“约翰逊，你星期五杀了多少青年？”
