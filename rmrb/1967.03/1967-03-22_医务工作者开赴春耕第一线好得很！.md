Medical workers heading to the frontlines of spring plowing is excellent!

The war drums beat, and the banners wave. As the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors' support for agriculture armies rush to the frontlines of spring agricultural production, medical workers in Beijing, Jinan, and other places have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have rushed to the countryside to join the poor and lower-middle peasants in seizing revolution and promoting production. Their revolutionary actions are excellent! This is the correct direction for medical workers nationwide to "grasp revolution, promote production"!

Chairman Mao said: "Our fundamental problem is one of serving the people and how to serve the people." Medical teams supporting the countryside are acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Following Chairman Mao's instruction to shift the focus of medical work to the countryside, at this critical moment of spring agricultural production in the countryside, they have broken out of the "urban health department" circle and thrown themselves into the fiery struggle of the countryside. They have overcome various material difficulties to ensure the health of the broad masses of farmers and to support the victory of spring agricultural production and the cultural revolution in the countryside, achieving excellent results.

Support, support, and support with Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support. They support the countryside, not only as medical teams but also as propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought. While serving the countryside, they study Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants, strive to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, cultivate class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants, break personal desires and establish public spirit, strengthen ideological revolutionization, and provide favorable conditions for further advancing the cultural revolution in their units.

Revolutionary medical workers, let us actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, properly arrange the cultural revolution and work in our units, and dispatch personnel to the frontlines of spring agricultural production as much as possible, to contribute our strength to achieving a bumper harvest this year!

    医务工作者开赴春耕第一线好得很！
    战鼓催，旌旗奋。随着工交、财贸等各行各业支农大军纷纷开赴春耕生产第一线，首都、济南等地广大医务人员响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，奔赴农村，与贫下中农一起抓革命，促生产，他们的革命行动好得很！这是全国医务工作者“抓革命，促生产”的正确方向！
    毛主席说：“我们的问题基本上是一个为群众的问题和一个如何为群众的问题。”下乡支援农村的医疗队正在遵照毛主席的教导去做。他们根据毛主席把卫生工作重点放到农村去的指示，在农村春耕生产的关键时刻，跳出了“城市卫生部”的圈子，投身到农村火热的斗争中去。他们克服了各种物质条件上的困难，为保证广大农民的身体健康，为支援春耕生产和农村文化大革命的胜利进行，作出了很好的成绩。
    千支援，万支援，用毛泽东思想支援农村是最大的支援。他们下乡支援农村，既是医务工作队，又是毛泽东思想宣传队。他们在为农村服务的同时，和贫下中农一起，活学活用毛主席著作，努力向贫下中农学习，培养贫下中农的阶级感情，破私立公，加强思想革命化，为进一步搞好本单位的文化大革命提供了有利条件。
    革命的医务工作者，让我们积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，妥善安排本单位的文化革命和工作，尽可能抽调人员，到春耕生产第一线去，为夺取今年农业大丰收贡献自己的力量！
