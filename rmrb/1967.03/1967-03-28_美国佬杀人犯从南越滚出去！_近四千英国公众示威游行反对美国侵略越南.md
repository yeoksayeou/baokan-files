	Yanks, Murderers, Get Out of South Vietnam!
	Nearly 4,000 British Public Protest March Against U.S. Aggression in Vietnam

	Nearly 4,000 protesters from all over Britain, holding placards, began a two-day Easter march in London on March 26 to protest against the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam and the British Labour government's support for the U.S. policy of aggression in Vietnam.

	At noon on March 26, the protesters set off from Northolt on the western outskirts of London. As they passed the U.S. Third Air Force Headquarters located near Ruslip Road in Northolt, they erupted in a chorus of protests against the U.S. war in Vietnam. The protesters shouted, "Yankee warmongers, get out, get out, get out!" "Yanks, murderers, get out, get out, get out!" "Victory to the (South Vietnamese) National Liberation Front!" The U.S. Air Force Headquarters was heavily guarded by British police.

	Some young workers and students participating in the Easter march carried with them the "Little Red Book"—Quotations from Chairman Mao. They told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that they were proud to follow the words of Chairman Mao Zedong.

	The placards they carried depicted a picture of a U.S. paper tiger being tightly bound by the ropes of the Vietnamese people's war. The protesters held up many placards with slogans such as: "Stop U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam!" "Arrest the murderer Johnson!" "Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people!" "Wilson, stop supporting the U.S. murderers!" "Support the struggle of the Vietnamese people!" "No shameful negotiations, the U.S. must get out of (South) Vietnam immediately!" "Long live the (South Vietnamese) National Liberation Front!" "Yankees, get out of Africa, Asia, and Latin America!"

	The protesters also carried the flags of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	In the afternoon, a group of "singers for Vietnamese freedom" performed songs in London's Sohar Park. These singers condemned the U.S. government for sending more and more troops into Vietnam. They said, "The Americans have no right to stay in Vietnam."

	In addition to the march from Northolt, about 1,000 Easter marchers left Aldermaston on March 25 to come to London.

    美国佬杀人犯从南越滚出去！
    近四千英国公众示威游行反对美国侵略越南
    新华社伦敦二十六日电　来自英国全国各地的将近四千名示威者，手里举着标语牌，二十六日在伦敦开始举行为时两天的复活节进军，抗议美国侵略越南的战争和英国工党政府支持美国的侵越政策。
    二十六日中午，示威者从伦敦西郊的诺索尔特出发。当他们通过设在诺索尔特附近的鲁斯里普路的美国第三空军司令部时，爆发出一片抗议美国侵越战争的怒吼声。示威者高呼：“美国战争贩子滚出去，滚出去，滚出去！”、“美国佬杀人犯滚出去，滚出去，滚出去！”、“胜利属于（越南南方）民族解放阵线！”。美国空军司令部由英国警察严密守卫着。
    参加这次复活节进军的一些青年工人和学生随身带着“小红书”——《毛主席语录》，他们告诉新华社记者说，他们以听毛泽东主席的话而感到自豪。
    他们所拿的标语牌上画着一幅戳穿美国纸老虎的画，这只美国纸老虎被越南人民战争的绳索紧紧地捆绑着。
    示威者举着许多标语牌，上面写着：“制止美帝国主义对越南的侵略！”、“通缉杀人凶手约翰逊！”、“越南是越南人民的！”、“威尔逊停止支持美国杀人凶手！”、“支持越南人民的斗争！”、“不进行可耻的谈判，美国立即（从南越）滚出去！”、“（越南南方）民族解放阵线万岁！”、“美国从非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲的一切地方滚出去！”
    示威者还拿着越南南方民族解放阵线和越南民主共和国的旗帜。
    下午，一批“争取越南自由的民歌手”在伦敦索萨尔公园演唱歌曲。这些民歌手谴责美国政府把越来越多的军队投入越南。他们说：“美国人没有权利赖在越南。”
    除了诺索尔特的进军以外，还有约一千名复活节进军者二十五日离开阿尔德马斯顿前来伦敦。
