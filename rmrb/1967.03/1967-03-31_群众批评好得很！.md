The criticism from the masses is excellent!

Recently, many cadres who have made mistakes, under the call of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and with the help of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, have bravely come forward, determined to sever ties with the bourgeois reactionary line, discard the old and seek the new, and repent. The broad revolutionary masses warmly welcome their progress.

However, there are still some cadres who are still stuck in their personal little circles, grudgingly holding onto the masses' exposure and criticism. They seem to have many grievances.

They are always calculating: what kind of cadre am I? Was the criticism of me right or wrong? They are always murmuring: I do have mistakes, and burning them off is fine, but the fire is too fierce!

They are always calculating: if I am criticized, my authority will be lost, my face will be lost, and who will listen to me if I am still a cadre in the future?

Therefore, although they do not dare to openly criticize the proletarian cultural revolution mass movement, they are always grumbling in their stomachs. This sentiment comes from the bourgeois kingdom deep in their souls. This is not a righteous spirit, but an evil spirit. At this crucial moment when the proletarian cultural revolution enters the struggle for the "three-in-one combination" to seize power, all cadres who truly want to revolutionize should awaken, and drive out this evil spirit.

We say that this proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution to eliminate the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, touching the souls of people. If you have made mistakes, the masses criticize you to help you improve, not to criticize you down. Without criticism, it is impossible to save cadres. A leading cadre said: "The masses fight me seven or eight times, and I am awakened. I dare to make myself a living target and dare to perform a major surgery on my mind." This is well said! Every cadre who has made mistakes should face their own mistakes, bravely accept the masses' criticism, and not always calculate whether the criticism is right or wrong. One should realize that it is this movement that saves you from the pit of mistakes, preventing you from sinking deeper. Therefore, you should not feel wronged, but rather feel fortunate.

The fire is too fierce? What's wrong with being fierce! The blazing fire of the proletarian cultural revolution will only burn away the bourgeoisie's filth deep in your soul. Fire refines gold. If you are a revolutionary, in the furnace of the revolutionary mass movement, you will only become stronger. Your current dejected appearance is a complete exposure of bourgeois individualism, which shows that the masses' criticism of you is not too fierce, but not fierce enough. It also shows that your bourgeois thoughts need to be criticized, fought against, and touched deeply in your soul to make you wake up.

Are you still calculating your personal "face" and "authority"? Then we ask: why did you wrongly treat the masses in the past, and now you feel that your face is lost when the masses criticize you? Why did you wrongly suppress the masses in the past, and now you cannot bear it when the masses criticize and fight against your mistakes? Calculating personal "face" and "authority" can only show that you still want to be an official, lord over the people, and not sincerely accept the masses' supervision. As for the future, if you are revolutionary and your words are beneficial to the people, then you do not need to worry about no one listening to you. Conversely, naturally, no one will listen to you. The key lies entirely with you.

The grievances of some cadres, after all, stem from the "I" mentality and resistance to the revolutionary mass movement. These comrades should understand that the revolutionary mass movement is naturally reasonable. Although some masses may have this or that shortcoming, the mainstream of the mass movement is always in line with the development of society. Therefore, we should see the mainstream of the mass movement and fully recognize the great significance of this revolution for the fate of our party and country, and the future of the world revolution from a political and ideological perspective. A foreign revolutionary comrade said well: now in the world, there is only the lesson of socialist countries turning into revisionism, but there is no experience of socialist countries not producing revisionism; China's cultural revolution is creating such experience. If we think from the perspective of the party's long-term and millennial plans, from ensuring that the party and the country do not change color, accelerating socialist construction, and promoting world revolution, then our minds will be suddenly enlightened. We should feel extremely happy and proud for the future of the revolutionary cause.

We must warn those cadres who still have grievances: you have put yourself in a position opposed to the masses and the cultural revolution in the past, making various mistakes. Can you still make mistakes on top of mistakes? We must shout loudly: this is dangerous! Wake up quickly!

    群众批评好得很！
    解红
    最近，许多犯错误的干部，在毛主席革命路线的感召下，在无产阶级革命派的帮助下，正在勇敢地站出来，决心同资产阶级反动路线一刀两断，弃旧图新，翻然悔改。广大革命群众热烈欢迎他们的这种进步。
    但是，也还有那么一些干部，现在还是成天纠缠在个人的小圈子里，对于群众的揭发批判，耿耿于怀。他们好象有不少委屈。
    他们老是在那里盘算：自己是几类干部呀，究竟对我批判对了还是批判错了呀？他们老是在那里嘀嘀咕咕，自己有错误，烧一烧固然可以，可是，火太猛了呀。
    他们老是在那里计较：批了，威信扫地了呀，面子丢尽了呀，以后还当干部，说话有人听吗？
    因此，对于无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，他们现在虽然不敢公开指指点点，却总是在肚皮里叽叽咕咕。这种情绪，是从那些人灵魂深处的资产阶级王国里冒出来的。这不是一股正气，而是一股邪气。在无产阶级文化大革命进入革命的“三结合”夺权斗争的关键时刻，一切真正愿意革命的干部，都应该觉悟起来，排除这股邪气。
    我们说，这次无产阶级文化大革命是灭资兴无、触及人们灵魂的大革命。你犯了错误，群众对你进行批判，是为了把你批好，而不是为了把你批倒。不批，谈不上挽救干部。有一个领导干部就说：“群众七斗八斗，把我斗醒了，我要敢于把自己当活靶，敢于对自己的头脑动大手术。”这话说得好！每一个犯错误的干部，都应该正视自己的错误，勇于接受群众的批判，而不应该成天盘算是批对了啊，还是批错了。应当认识到，正是这次运动，把你从错误的泥坑里挽救出来，使你不致越陷越深。因此，不但不应该感到委屈，相反，还应该感到庆幸。
    火力太猛了吗？猛一些有何不好！无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，烧掉的只会是你灵魂深处资产阶级思想的污泥渣滓。烈火炼真金。你如果是一个革命者，在革命群众运动的熔炉中，只会越炼越坚强。你现在那副垂头丧气的样子，完全是资产阶级个人主义的暴露，这正说明群众对你批判的火力不是太猛了，而是还不够。这也正说明，还需要对你的资产阶级思想好好地批一批，斗一斗，狠狠地触一触你的灵魂，才能使你醒悟过来。
    你现在还在计较什么个人“面子”、“威信”吗？那我们要问一问：为什么只准你过去错误地对待群众，而群众对你进行批评，你就觉得面子下不去了呢？为什么只准你过去整群众，而群众对你的错误进行批判斗争，你就受不住了呢？斤斤计较个人的“面子”、“威信”，只能说明，你现在还是想做官当老爷，高踞于群众之上，而不是决心当一个人民的勤务员，老老实实地接受群众的监督。至于今后，你如果是革命的，说的话对人民有利，那就不必担心没人听你的。反之，自然不会有人再来听你的。其关键，完全在你自己。
    某些干部的委屈情绪，归根到底，还是从“我”字出发，对革命的群众运动有抵触。这些同志应该懂得，革命的群众运动，它天然是合理的。尽管有些群众会有这样那样的缺点，但是群众运动的主流总是适合社会的发展的。因此，我们应该看到群众运动的主流，应该从政治上、思想上充分认识当前这场革命对我们党和国家的命运、对世界革命的前途所产生的伟大意义。有一位国外的革命战友说得好：现在世界上只有社会主义国家变成修正主义的教训，而没有社会主义国家不出修正主义的经验；中国的文化大革命就在创造这样的经验。如果我们从党的千年大计、万年大计着想，从保证党和国家不变颜色，加速社会主义建设，促进世界革命着想，那么，我们的心胸就会豁然开朗。我们应当为革命事业的前途感到无比幸福，无比自豪。
    我们要告诫那些至今还有委屈情绪的干部：你们过去把自己置于同群众对立的地位，置于同文化大革命对立的地位，犯了这样那样的错误，现在还能够错上加错吗？我们要大喝一声：这是危险的！赶快猛醒吧！
