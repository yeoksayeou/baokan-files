The U.S. government is accelerating the "escalation" of the Vietnam War and President Johnson is about to personally go to Guam to hold a meeting to plan further expansion of the war. At this time, the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on March 13 approved an additional $122 billion in military spending for Vietnam and a series of other war-related appropriations.

This indicates that the U.S. imperialists, unwilling to accept defeat in South Vietnam, are preparing to place even bigger bets on the South Vietnamese battlefield and engage in even more reckless war adventures.

As the Vietnam War "gradually escalates," U.S. military spending is becoming increasingly enormous. The $103 billion allocated for the Vietnam War in the 1966-1967 budget is far from sufficient. In this situation, Johnson proposed at the beginning of this year, when Congress reconvened, to add $122.76 million in additional appropriations for Vietnam, of which $91 billion will be used for the 1966-1967 fiscal year ending June 30.

Other war-related appropriations approved by the Appropriations Committee on the same day include $35 billion to purchase 721 additional aircraft, 863 helicopters, and parts; $12 billion to purchase bombs, missiles, and ammunition. The Associated Press acknowledged: "The rate at which these equipments are being consumed in the Vietnam War is higher than the rate predicted a year ago for possible losses during the war process."

In addition, the committee also approved an additional $54.93 million for "massive military construction plans" in Asia and the Pacific region. This amount is mainly used for the construction of military facilities in South Vietnam and Thailand, which serve as U.S. bases for the invasion of Vietnam.

### 赌注越大　输得越惨  美帝又增加侵越战费一百二十二亿美元

    赌注越大　输得越惨
    美帝又增加侵越战费一百二十二亿美元
    新华社十四日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国政府加速侵越战争“升级”、约翰逊即将亲自去关岛召开会议策划进一步扩大战争的时候，美国众议院拨款委员会十三日通过增拨一百二十二亿美元的侵越军费及一系列其他的战争拨款。
    这表明，不甘心在南越失败的美帝国主义，正准备在南越战场投下更大的赌注，进行更疯狂的战争冒险。
    随着侵越战争的“逐步升级”，美国的战费开支也日益浩大，一九六六——一九六七年度预算中的一百零三亿美元的侵越战费远远不敷应用。在这种情况下，约翰逊在今年初国会复会时，提出了追加侵越拨款一百二十二亿七千六百万美元的要求，其中九十一亿美元将用于到六月三十日为止的一九六六——一九六七财政年度。
    拨款委员会在同一天通过的其他战争拨款中，包括用三十五亿美元增购七百二十一架飞机、八百六十三架直升飞机及零件；十二亿美元增购炸弹、导弹、弹药。合众国际社在报道中承认：“这些装备在越南战争中消耗的比率大于一年前预计在战争进程中可能损耗的比率”。
    此外，委员会还通过增拨五亿四千九百三十万美元，用于在亚洲及太平洋地区的“浩大的军事建设计划”；这笔款项，主要是用于在南越及作为美国侵越基地的泰国修建军事设施。
