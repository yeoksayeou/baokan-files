Chinese workers at the construction site of the national theater in Somalia, which is being built with Chinese aid, all wear radiant Chairman Mao badges on their chests. Under the great leader's guidance of wholeheartedly serving the people of the world, they work closely with their Somali comrades, learning from each other and helping each other. The Somali workers deeply feel that these Chinese technicians sent by Chairman Mao are better than any foreign experts they have ever encountered. Especially after watching the film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" and reading Chairman Mao's works, they admire and love the beloved leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, even more. They eagerly ask their Chinese friends for Chairman Mao badges.

A Somali worker, pointing to the Chairman Mao badge on his chest, told a reporter: "I know Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people, and I love him. It is he who sent such good experts and workers. They work with us on the construction site every day, endure the sun, and sweat together. I have never seen such good foreign experts."

Two Somali apprentices who often read Chairman Mao's works said: "Every time we read Chairman Mao's works, it feels as if Chairman Mao is standing right before us. Once, when we were reading an article about Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze River, we felt as if we were among the thousands of people swimming and joyfully swimming by Chairman Mao's side." These two apprentices also hung a colorful portrait of Chairman Mao at the entrance of their dormitory to express their love for Chairman Mao.

    毛主席就在我们面前
    在中国援助索马里建设的国家剧场工地上工作的中国工人，每个人的胸前都佩戴着光芒四射的毛主席像章。在伟大领袖的全心全意地为世界人民服务的教导下，他们与索马里的工人弟兄们紧密合作，互相学习，互相帮助。索马里工人们深深感到这些由毛主席派来的中国技术人员，比他们从前遇到的任何外国专家都好。特别是在他们看了《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》的电影，读了毛主席著作之后，对中国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席更加敬仰，更加热爱。他们纷纷向中国朋友索取毛主席像章。
    一位索马里工人指着自己胸前的毛主席像章对记者说：“我知道毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖，我热爱他。是他派来了这么好的专家和工人，他们每天在工地上和我们一起干活，一起烤太阳，流汗水。我从来没有见过这样好的外国专家。”两位经常读毛主席著作的索马里徒工说：“每当我们读毛主席著作时，好象毛主席就站在我们的面前。有一次，我们在读记述毛主席畅游长江的文章时，我们也好象置身于数千名参加游泳的人们的中间，欢乐地游泳在毛主席的身边”。这两位徒工还在他们的宿舍门前张贴了一幅毛主席的彩色像，表达他们对毛主席的敬爱。
