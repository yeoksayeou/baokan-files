The heroic armed forces of liberation in Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, from February 26 to March 11, launched fierce attacks on the American long-range artillery positions, enemy strongholds, and airfields north of Route 9, achieving a brilliant victory by annihilating 2,730 enemy soldiers. Almost all of the annihilated enemy soldiers were American invaders.

During these 14 days, the liberation armed forces completely wiped out and severely damaged eight American companies; destroyed 20 tanks and armored vehicles and seven 175mm cannons, shot down and destroyed 13 helicopters, and burned down one fuel depot.

On the nights of February 26 and 28, the liberation armed forces launched fierce artillery attacks on the American artillery positions in the Yu Linh area north of Yutang. The shells accurately hit the enemy's positions, fortifications, and barracks, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. On February 28, the American bandits, who were confused and disoriented, air-dropped reinforcements. However, these invaders were immediately intercepted and fiercely attacked by the liberation armed forces. In the battle, a platoon of the liberation army fought against an American company for seven hours, annihilating a large number of enemy soldiers and destroying two helicopters. That night, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce assault on the American invaders, annihilating over 100 enemy soldiers and destroying three 175mm cannons.

From March 1 to 4, the liberation armed forces launched fierce artillery attacks on the enemy artillery positions and the 182 and 137 highlands in the Kun Tian area, annihilating hundreds of enemy soldiers. At the same time, the liberation armed forces intercepted the American invaders in the Ji Shan and Bai Shan areas southwest of Yu Linh and attacked the Da Gan airfield northwest of Xiang Hua, killing and wounding 670 enemy soldiers, destroying and shooting down eight helicopters, destroying five tanks, and burning down one fuel depot.

On March 4, the liberation armed forces attacked and intercepted the American invaders on the road from Dong He west by 10 kilometers and from Nam Dong to Gan Lu, annihilating 200 enemy soldiers and destroying six armored vehicles.

On March 6, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce assault on the enemy artillery positions on Hill 241, annihilating 485 enemy soldiers and rendering the artillery position completely paralyzed. That same night, the liberation armed forces launched another fierce artillery attack on the enemy artillery positions in the Yu Linh area, destroying four 175mm cannons and annihilating 200 American soldiers.

After suffering continuous heavy blows, the American invaders hastily dispatched a puppet paratrooper regiment to rescue them. However, as soon as this regiment entered the Yu Linh area, it was struck by the liberation armed forces and suffered heavy losses, forcing it to retreat to the Dong He area.

During this period, the liberation armed forces also smashed the enemy's "sweeping" operations in some areas north of Route 9 in an attempt to salvage their defeat.

    南越战场捷报频传
    广治省军民奋战两周歼灭美军两千多
    据新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：英雄的越南南方广治省解放武装力量，在二月二十六日到三月十一日期间，连续对第九号公路北面的美军远程大炮阵地、美军据点和机场发动猛烈袭击，取得了消灭敌人二千七百三十名的辉煌战绩。在被歼的敌人中几乎全部是美国侵略军。
    在这十四天中，解放武装力量全歼和重创美军八个连；击毁坦克和装甲车二十辆和一七五毫米口径大炮七门，击落和击毁直升飞机十三架，烧毁汽油库一座。
    在二月二十六日和二十八日夜间，解放武装力量以猛烈的炮火，连续轰击犹灵北部育庙地区的美军炮兵阵地。炮弹准确地击中了敌人的阵地、工事和营房，使敌人遭到严重损失。二十八日，被打得懵头转向的美国强盗空投了援军，但是这些侵略者立即遭到解放武装力量的猛烈截击，在战斗中，解放军的一个班同美军一个连进行了持续七个小时的激战，消灭大批敌人，击毁直升飞机两架。这天夜里，解放武装力量又猛攻美国侵略军，消灭敌人一百多名，击毁一七五毫米口径的大炮三门。
    三月一日到四日，解放武装力量又以猛烈炮火轰击昆天地区的敌军炮兵阵地和一八二、一三七等高地的敌人，消灭敌人成百名。与此同时，解放武装力量还截击了犹灵西南的吉山和拜山地区的美国侵略军，并袭击了香化西北的达根机场，共打死打伤敌人六百七十名，击毁和击落直升飞机八架，击毁坦克五辆，烧毁汽油库一座。
    三月四日，解放武装力量分别在东河西北十公里和从南东到甘露的路上，袭击和截击美国侵略军，消灭敌人二百名，击毁装甲车六辆。
    三月六日，解放武装力量又猛攻二四一高地的敌军炮兵阵地，消灭敌人四百八十五名，使这个炮兵阵地立即陷于瘫痪。当天深夜，解放武装力量再一次连续猛烈炮击犹灵地区敌人的炮兵阵地，击毁敌人一七五毫米口径大炮四门，消灭美军二百名。
    美国侵略强盗在遭到连续不断的沉重打击之后，慌忙出动伪军一个伞兵战团前来救援。但是，这个战团刚刚踏入犹灵地区，就遭到解放武装力量的致命打击，损失惨重，被迫撤回东河地区。
    在这期间，解放武装力量还粉碎了敌人为挽救败局而对第九号公路北面一些地区发动的“扫荡”。（附图片）
