Firmly Defend Chairman Mao's Revolutionary "Three-in-One Combination" Policy
— Red Rebels and Military Cadres in Heilongjiang Province Discuss Learning from the Editorial in the Fifth Issue of *Red Flag* Magazine

Learn from the Representatives of the Revolutionary Masses

Ji Bingwen of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military District said: The editorial in the fifth issue of *Red Flag* magazine points out: "The broad revolutionary masses are the foundation for the revolutionary cadres to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They are the foundation for the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' provisional power organs." From this, we once again feel Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's boundless trust, boundless care, and boundless concern for the revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes," "The people have boundless creativity." The revolutionary masses nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are especially so. Their representatives are outstanding successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. They love our great leader Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao the most. Precisely because of this, their actions best reflect the revolutionary direction and best embody the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In participating in the work of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary "Three-in-One Combination" Revolutionary Committee, we have learned many precious lessons from the representatives of the revolutionary masses. Those young revolutionaries and red rebels, uniting with the broad revolutionary masses, have made immortal contributions in the struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. After establishing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs, they do not become arrogant or complacent in the face of victory. While working, they also conduct rectification, continually overcoming shortcomings, correcting mistakes, further strengthening their revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline. This makes the provisional power organs full of vitality and brimming with vigor. They handle issues and deal with the masses with the most principled attitude, the least conservative thinking, daring to submit to the truth, and kicking away all the old rules and frameworks that hinder our progress. They maintain close ties with the broad revolutionary mass organizations, consult with the masses on every matter, greatly reducing bureaucratism, clericalism, and pedantic philosophy in the offices. They work tirelessly, taking their responsibilities seriously. They are indeed the foundation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs.

The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" shines with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. We wholeheartedly support and endorse the participation of those who truly represent the broad revolutionary masses in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs. We deeply feel that without valuing their role, it would be impossible to establish, as Chairman Mao pointed out, a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative provisional power organ of the proletariat. Those who exclude them and treat them as mere decorations are actually sabotaging the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, and we will not allow it. We are determined to fight for the implementation and defense of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy and to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the end.

The Mighty Power of Chairman Mao's Policy on Cadres

Zhan Jicheng of Harbin Normal University said: The editorial in the fifth issue of *Red Flag* magazine points out: "The role of revolutionary cadres in the 'three-in-one combination' provisional power organs must be fully estimated. They should and can play a core and backbone role in this organ." Practice has proven that with the participation of revolutionary leading cadres in the "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs, the proletarian revolutionary faction can truly seize power, and the provisional power organs can truly establish proletarian authority, leading the broad revolutionary masses to new victories. The participation of revolutionary leading cadres in the "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs fully embodies the mighty power of Chairman Mao's policy on cadres.

In working together with the revolutionary leading cadres in the provincial revolutionary committee, we increasingly feel that revolutionary leading cadres are our good teachers and friends. They are politically more mature and have richer fighting experience. They have the ability to manage the state and business for the proletariat. The red rebels, the People's Liberation Army, and they, together, can make the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat surge to new heights and achieve new victories.

These revolutionary leading cadres, with boundless affection for the Party and Chairman Mao, work diligently and conscientiously, taking on hardships and responsibilities. For the people's interests, they dare to uphold the truth and also dare to correct mistakes. For the major affairs of the Party and the state, they work day and night, sparing no effort. They are increasingly playing a core and backbone role.

We are moved by the revolutionary leading cadres' boundless enthusiasm and their spirit of studying Chairman Mao's works. Some cadres in their fifties, despite poor health, often disregard the day's work fatigue and insist on studying Chairman Mao's works late into the night. They say: To always stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, for the early arrival of communism, one must study until old age. These revolutionary leading cadres are indeed precious assets of the Party and the people.

At this critical moment of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, Chairman Mao once again points out the direction of our victory and asks us to seriously implement the policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly oppose the view of generally rejecting and overthrowing cadres; firmly oppose using the pretext of "three-in-one combination" to engage in centrism and conciliation, merging into one. We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly implement and defend the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." In the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organs, we will unite well with the comrades from the PLA and the revolutionary leading cadres, be good students, and humbly learn from them, mastering their good thoughts, good styles, and good experiences. We will strive to arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and fulfill the great mission bestowed upon us, the proletarian revolutionary rebels.

The PLA is the Pillar of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

Hou Runchang of Harbin Institute of Technology said: The editorial in the fifth issue of *Red Flag* magazine points out: "The attitude towards the People's Liberation Army is the attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it is also an important sign to distinguish whether one is a genuine revolutionary leftist." The People's Liberation Army is the people's army created by Chairman Mao. In the past, under Chairman Mao's leadership, the People's Liberation Army, together with the people of the whole country, overthrew the dark rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and won the world of the proletariat. Now, in the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary faction's great alliance to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the People's Liberation Army once again stands firmly on the side of the broad leftist masses, defending and executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strongly supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction to seize and hold power, which has greatly encouraged us.

Those class enemies who are unwilling to admit defeat hate our victory deeply. They have launched one attack after another against the revolutionary masses, but they have not succeeded. Under the powerful counterattack of the People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionary rebels united as one, the class enemies' plots have been foiled time and time again. I remember on January 23, when the Red Rebel Corps was attacked by the so-called "Honor Restoration Army" at the Friendship Palace, we rushed to the scene to support them upon hearing the news. When we arrived, the PLA had already surrounded the so-called "Honor Restoration Army" tightly. At that time, we were truly overjoyed and spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" At that time, the provincial military district chief also personally led us to launch a political offensive against the so-called "Honor Restoration Army," dissolving this reactionary organization and striking at their reactionary leaders.

In the struggle to seize power, the People's Liberation Army also sent people to participate in the provincial revolutionary committee, fighting side by side with us, heart to heart, shoulder to shoulder. They helped us study Chairman Mao's works, helped us use Chairman Mao's class struggle viewpoint to analyze and solve problems. Their clear proletarian stance and deep proletarian feelings have deeply educated and influenced us.

In the days of fighting side by side with the comrades from the PLA, we increasingly feel the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The People's Liberation Army is not only a powerful backing for us to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party but also the steel pillar for implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. Without the People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao, there would be no proletarian dictatorship, and there would be no victory for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Whoever opposes the People's Liberation Army participating in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," whoever directs the spearhead of struggle at the People's Liberation Army, we will fight to the end with them.

We will forever unite with the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary cadres, fight with them, and win with them! We will forever advance bravely along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    坚决捍卫毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”方针
    ——黑龙江省红色造反者和部队干部谈学习《红旗》杂志第五期社论体会
    向革命群众的代表学习
    黑龙江省军区纪炳文说：《红旗》杂志第五期社论指出：“广大革命群众，是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的基础，是革命的‘三结合’临时权力机构的基础。”从这里，我们再一次感到毛主席和党中央对革命群众的无限信任，无限爱护，无限关怀。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力”。在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的革命群众，尤其是这样。他们的代表人物，是无产阶级革命事业的优秀接班人。他们最热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席，最听毛主席的话。正因为这样，他们的行动最能体现革命的大方向，最能体现战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    在参加黑龙江省革命的“三结合”的革命委员会工作当中，我们向革命群众的代表学到了许多宝贵的东西。那些革命小将和红色造反者，团结广大革命群众，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。在建立革命的“三结合”临时权力机构以后，他们在胜利面前不骄傲，不自满，一边工作，一边整风，不断克服缺点，纠正错误，进一步加强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，使临时权力机构充满了新生的朝气，洋溢着一片蓬勃的景象。他们处理问题，对待群众，最能坚持原则，最少有保守思想，勇于服从真理，把那些阻碍我们前进的旧条条旧框框一脚踢开。他们和广大革命群众组织保持密切联系，遇事和群众商量，大大减少了机关中的官僚主义、文牍主义和烦琐哲学。他们废寝忘食，对工作积极负责。他们不愧是革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的基础。
    革命的“三结合”，闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。我们对真正代表广大革命群众的革命群众组织负责人参加革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，一千个支持，一万个拥护。我们深刻地体会到，不重视他们的作用，就不可能象毛主席所指出的那样，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。谁排斥他们，把他们当作陪衬，那实际上就是破坏革命的“三结合”的方针，我们绝不答应。我们决心为实行和保卫革命的“三结合”方针，为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线斗争到底。
        毛主席的干部政策威力无比
    哈尔滨师范学院战继红说：《红旗》杂志第五期社论指出：“革命干部参加‘三结合’的临时权力机构的作用，必须充分估计。他们应该而且可能在这个机构中起核心作用和骨干作用。”实践证明，有革命领导干部参加“三结合”的临时权力机构，就能使无产阶级革命派真正掌好权，就能使临时权力机构真正树立起无产阶级权威，领导广大革命群众夺取新的胜利。革命领导干部参加“三结合”临时权力机构，充分体现了毛主席的干部政策的巨大威力。
    我们在和省革命委员会里的革命领导干部一道工作中，越来越深刻地感到，革命领导干部是我们的良师益友。他们在政治上比较成熟，斗争经验比较丰富，他们有为无产阶级国家掌权和管理业务的能力。红色造反者、人民解放军和他们结合在一起，就能使无产阶级文化大革命掀起一个又一个的新高潮，取得一个又一个的新胜利。
    这些革命领导干部，怀着对党和毛主席的无限深情，工作兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，任劳任怨。他们为了人民的利益，勇于坚持真理，也勇于修正错误。他们为了党和国家的大事，夜以继日，废寝忘食，绞尽脑汁地工作。他们在越来越明显地起着核心作用和骨干作用。
    我们为革命领导干部的冲天干劲而感动，为他们那种刻苦学习毛主席著作的精神而感动。有些年过半百的革命领导干部，尽管身体不好，但是经常不顾一天工作的劳累，深夜里还坚持学习毛主席著作。他们说：为了永远坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，为了共产主义的早日到来，要活到老，学到老，用到老。这些革命的领导干部，确实是党和人民的宝贵财富。
    目前，在这无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，毛主席又一次给我们指出了胜利前进的方向，要求我们认真实行革命的“三结合”的方针。我们决心按照毛主席的教导，坚决反对对干部一概排斥、一概打倒的观点；坚决反对借口“三结合”搞折中主义，调和主义，合二而一。我们决心按照毛主席的教导，坚决实行和保卫革命的“三结合”。在革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构里，我们要和解放军同志团结好，和革命领导干部团结好，当好小学生，虚心向他们学习，把他们的好思想，好作风，好经验学到手。我们要努力用毛泽东思想武装头脑，圆满地完成历史赋予我们无产阶级革命造反者的伟大使命。
      解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石
    哈尔滨工程学院侯润棠说：《红旗》杂志第五期社论指出：“对于人民解放军的态度，就是对于无产阶级专政的态度，也是区别是不是真正的革命左派的一个重要标志。”人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队。过去，在毛主席领导下，人民解放军和全国人民一道推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的黑暗统治，打下了无产阶级的天下。现在，在无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，人民解放军又坚定不移地站在左派广大群众一边，保卫和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大力支持无产阶级革命派夺权和掌权，使我们受到了极大鼓舞。
    那些不甘心失败的阶级敌人，对我们的胜利恨之入骨。他们向革命群众发起了一次又一次的围攻和反扑，但是，他们根本不能得逞。在人民解放军和无产阶级革命造反派团结一致的有力还击下，阶级敌人的阴谋活动一次又一次地都被打垮了。记得一月二十三日那天，红色造反团在友谊宫遭到反动组织所谓“荣复军”袭击的危急时刻，我们闻讯后立即赶到现场支援，到那里一看，解放军早已把所谓“荣复军”包围得水泄不通了。当时我们心里真有说不出的高兴，情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”当时，省军区首长还亲自带领我们向所谓“荣复军”发起了政治攻势，瓦解了这个反动组织，打击了他们的反动头目。
    在夺权斗争中，人民解放军又派人参加了省革命委员会，与我们心连心、肩并肩地战斗在一起。他们帮助我们学习毛主席著作，帮助我们用毛主席的阶级斗争的观点分析问题，解决问题。他们那种鲜明的无产阶级立场，深厚的无产阶级感情，深深地教育和感染了我们。
    在我们和解放军同志并肩战斗的日子里，越来越深刻地体会到毛主席教导的“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的伟大意义。人民解放军不仅是我们斗倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的强大后盾，而且是实行革命的“三结合”，巩固无产阶级政权的钢铁柱石。没有毛主席缔造的人民解放军，就没有无产阶级专政，也就没有无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。谁要反对人民解放军参加革命的“三结合”，谁要把斗争矛头指向人民解放军，我们就坚决和他拚到底。
    我们永远和人民解放军、革命干部团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！我们永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进！
