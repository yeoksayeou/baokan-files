After Kosygin's visit to London, the coordination between the Soviets and Americans on the Vietnam issue has intensified. This has become the focus of many Western newspapers' reports and commentaries. From the excerpts of these reports and commentaries, one can see to what extent the Soviet revisionist leadership's treacherous acts have reached a level of utter shamelessness.

The collusion between the Soviets and Americans on the Vietnam issue is part of their global dealings. The central aim of this global deal is to carry out joint counter-revolutionary actions to confront the revolutionary storms sweeping the world, particularly to confront China.

However, as Chairman Mao has long pointed out, "the general trend of history has been determined and cannot be changed." The attempts by American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership to reverse the wheel of history are doomed to failure. The more evil deeds they commit, the more thoroughly their counter-revolutionary faces are exposed, and the sooner their doom will come.

Johnson Eager for Moscow's Help

"As time goes by, the stakes for the President in his gamble have become increasingly difficult to sustain.

"Nevertheless, Johnson still clings to his belief: Moscow will come to his rescue. But he hopes this rescue will not come too late."

February 28, *Le Figaro*

"The (American) government officials have received some indications about Moscow's attitude, which give them ample reason to be pleased. They say that the Soviet Union is now inclined to seek a solution based on the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Agreements. It is believed here that this indicates the Soviet Union's genuine desire for peace in Vietnam."

Agence France-Presse, Washington, February 25

"It can be said with considerable certainty that what Kosygin did in London was only the beginning. This new approach will not end here. Therefore, it can be safely assumed that Soviet and American representatives are somewhere in a secret room or elsewhere, jointly exploring new initiatives for peace in Vietnam."

February 27, *New York Herald Tribune*

The More the Soviet Revisionists Beg, the More the American Imperialists Act Arrogantly

"In fact, the United States even refuses to seek the kind of deal it sought a year ago during the bombing halt. At that time, Washington seemed prepared to extend the bombing halt until the peace talks began. This year, ... due to the Soviet Union's own willingness to act as a mediator, the Johnson administration's demands have increased. ...

"Moscow is now speaking on the peace issue and is actively seeking ways to end the war..."

February 20, *The New York Times*

"There are many indications here (Washington) that the ground war in Vietnam will further escalate.

"Here it is believed that Moscow is aware, and in fact some officials say, the increase in ground pressure is related to Kosygin's interest in talks."

March 1, *The Times*

Washington and Moscow Understand Each Other

"Here it is believed that despite Kosygin's failure in his peace mission in London, Moscow's response to Johnson's firm attitude is not displeasure but understanding.

"After the failure of the Russian efforts to arrange a ceasefire, there are some indications that the Russians plan to increase pressure on Hanoi."

United States Information Service, Washington, February 20

"In the many developments in the international situation in recent days, the most surprising phenomenon is that the superpowers (note: referring to the U.S. and the Soviet Union) do not consider the gradual escalation in South Vietnam and instead redouble their efforts to strengthen their ties and consolidate their common front."

February 28, *L'Humanité*

The Target is Aimed at China

"This London meeting also discussed the China issue at length, which may have strengthened Wilson's conclusion. He firmly refused to reveal anything about Kosygin's views on China and its intentions.

"But diplomats believe that Beijing's threat (note: referring to China's firm anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist stance) greatly influences Moscow's current and long-term policies."

United Press International, London, February 15

"As for Russia, increasing friendship with the West would ... allow it to concentrate its military and other forces more on an angry China..."

February 16, *The New York Times*

### 苏美在越南问题上干些什么勾当？  从西方报刊看苏修领导集团充当美帝帮凶的叛卖行为

专栏：外论摘要

    苏美在越南问题上干些什么勾当？
    从西方报刊看苏修领导集团充当美帝帮凶的叛卖行为
    柯西金访问伦敦以后，苏美在越南问题上勾结的步调更为加紧。这已经成为许多西方报刊报道和评论的中心。从这里摘录的一部分报道和评论中，可以看出苏修领导集团的叛卖行为已经到了何等丧心病狂的程度。
    苏美在越南问题上的勾结，是它们所进行的全球交易的一部分。这个全球交易的中心目的，就是进行反革命的联合行动，来对付全世界的革命风暴，特别是对付中国。
    但是，正如毛主席早就指出的，“历史的总趋向已经确定，不能改变了。”美帝国主义和苏修领导集团妄想扭转历史的车轮，是绝对办不到的。它们坏事干得越多，反革命面目暴露得越彻底，它们的灭亡也就一定来得越快。　——编者
        约翰逊急于要莫斯科帮忙
    “随着岁月的推移，（约翰逊）总统参加的赌博越来越难于赌下去了。……
    “但是，约翰逊还是死抱住他的信条：莫斯科将援救他。但是，希望这种援救不要太迟。”
                      二月二十八日法国《费加罗报》
    “（美国）政府人士得到了一些关于莫斯科态度的迹象，这些迹象使他们有充分理由感到高兴。他们说，苏联现在倾向于谋求在一九五四年和一九六二年日内瓦协议基础上取得解决。这里认为，这表明苏联要越南实现和平的愿望是真切的。”
                        法新社华盛顿二月二十五日电
    “可以十分肯定的说，柯西金在伦敦所作的事情不过是个开端而已。这种新的作法总是不会就此终结的。因此，可以十拿九稳地认为，苏联和美国的代表们正在某个密室或其他地方，共同探索导致越南和平的新倡议。”
                  二月二十七日《纽约先驱论坛报》
     苏修愈是乞求，美帝愈是嚣张
    “实际上，美国甚至拒绝谋求它在一年以前的停炸期间所谋求的那种交易。当时，华盛顿似乎准备延长停炸到举行和平会议期间。今年，……由于苏联自己表示愿意充当调停人，约翰逊政府的要价提高了。……
    “莫斯科现在在和平问题上说话了，并积极地想
  方设法来结束战争……”
                          二月二十日《纽约时报》
    “这里（华盛顿）有许多迹象表明，越南的地
  面战争将进一步加剧。……
      “这里认为，莫斯科是了解的，事实上这里有些官员说，增加地面压力同柯西金对和谈感兴趣一事有关。”
                        三月一日英国《泰晤士报》
    华盛顿莫斯科彼此心照不宣
    “这里认为，尽管柯西金在伦敦的和平使命失败，但是莫斯科对约翰逊的坚定态度所作出的反应并不是不高兴而是谅解。
    “在俄国人帮助安排停火的活动失败后，莫斯科没有发出谩骂，而是有一些迹象表明，俄国人打算增加对河内的压力。”
                    美国新闻处华盛顿二月二十日电
    “在最近几天国际局势的许多发展中，最令人吃惊的现象，是超级大国（译者注：指美苏）不考虑南越逐步升级的螺旋式上升，而加倍努力加紧它们之间的联系和巩固他们的共同阵线。”
                      二月二十八日法国《战斗报》
         矛头针对着中国
    “这次伦敦会谈还就中国问题进行了长时间的讨论，这可能加强威尔逊得出的结论。他坚决拒绝透露柯西金对中国以及它的意图的任何一点东西。
    “但是外交人士认为北京的威胁（译者注：指中国反帝反修的坚定立场）大大影响着莫斯科当前和长期的政策。”
                      合众国际社伦敦二月十五日电
    “至于俄国，同西方增加亲善就……使得它可以把军事力量和其他力量更加集中地来对付一个愤怒的中国……”
