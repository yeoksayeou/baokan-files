The "Poet" Who Sold His Soul

Recently, amidst the anti-China chorus orchestrated by the masters of the Kremlin, a few particularly jarring cries have emerged. These are the howls of the Soviet revisionist scoundrel poet Yevtushenko, who has taken the stage to perform.

Yevtushenko published two extremely reactionary poems in the seventh issue of the Soviet revisionist *Literary Gazette* this year, titled "The March of the Red Guards" and "Listen, the Music of the Cultural Revolution." With the filthiest and most vile thoughts and language, he maliciously curses and slanders our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attacking our country's Red Guards.

Let us endure and listen to Yevtushenko's howls:

		"Shouts,
		This is our music,
		People, listen!
		Trifles,
		Shouted like Munich."

Yevtushenko attempts to slander our unprecedented, magnificent Cultural Revolution as a storm in a teacup, as if the Chinese people have nothing better to do than to shout about trivial matters.

It seems this revisionist scoundrel is deliberately feigning ignorance. Is the Cultural Revolution in China a trivial matter? If so, why are all the ghosts and monsters in the world, including Yevtushenko himself, so enraged? Within our party, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, a handful of revisionist counter-revolutionaries in the style of Khrushchev, they have been preparing public opinion for capitalist restoration and engaging in extensive anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought conspiracies. The revolutionary people of China, of course, cannot take this lightly. In the Soviet Union, in the great homeland of Lenin, was it not due to the Khrushchev revisionist clique seizing power and implementing capitalist restoration? Yevtushenko knows very well that this is a major event, not a trivial matter. The historical tragedy that occurred in the Soviet Union is a very serious lesson. The Soviet people and revolutionary people all over the world will not believe Yevtushenko's lies.

This Soviet revisionist scoundrel poet actually slanders our country's Red Guards as "surrounding conscience, surrounding righteousness!"

Shut up! You Soviet revisionist traitors, what right do you have to talk about "conscience" and "righteousness"? It is you who have colluded with the world's number one enemy, American imperialism, betraying the interests of the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world. It is you who have helped American imperialism, this great robber, strangle the independence of the Congolese people, extinguish the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people, and betray the revolution of the Dominican people. It is you, this band of shameful traitors, who have joined American imperialism in fiercely opposing socialist China. In a word, your so-called "conscience" is colluding with American imperialism, acting as a tiger's accomplice, and betraying the world revolution! Your so-called "righteousness" is declaring that American imperialist aggression is justified, and that the resistance of oppressed peoples is a crime! You, this band of shameless traitors, have long since sold your "conscience" and soul cheaply to American imperialism.

Yevtushenko attacks our country's Red Guards domestically, saying to the counter-revolutionary revisionists: "Capitalist spies, speak, what do you want to do?" Dear Yevtushenko, this time you are right. You have given your fellow counter-revolutionary revisionists a fitting name: "capitalist spies." Exactly, we must expose a handful of "capitalist spies" during the Cultural Revolution and overthrow them. The Chinese people roar at the "capitalist spies" at home, and the big and small "capitalist spies" of the Soviet revisionists cannot stand it. Yevtushenko jumps out, furiously saying:

		"Hmph! Hmph! To dare call our fellow 'capitalist spies,' this is too much, too much!"

		"Birds of a feather flock together, and people of a kindred spirit congregate." What is Yevtushenko made of? Once his true colors are exposed, it becomes clear. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Yevtushenko became a famous figure in the Soviet revisionist literary world due to his rampant anti-Stalin activities. This clown who sold his soul claims that when Stalin died, "I wept like others," but before the tears dried, he followed Khrushchev in attacking Stalin. He even used the French bourgeois reactionary newspaper *France-Soir* to publish his *Autobiography*. In his *Autobiography*, he confessed to the imperialists, "I am ashamed of Stalin," and called the capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union after the 20th Congress of the CPSU the "spring of de-Stalinization." He even viciously attacked the great October Revolution led by Lenin. This shameless writer's naked treachery aroused the indignation of the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union. They appropriately called Yevtushenko the "thought leader of intellectual hooligans," the "singer of dirty deeds," and the "decadent bourgeois." It is precisely this scoundrel who was favored by the Soviet revisionist leadership and was nominated as a candidate for the "Lenin Literary Prize" and was again promoted to the position of director of the Moscow Writers' Union.

		Not only that, because he boldly sold his soul, he also won the favor of his American masters. At the end of 1966, Yevtushenko, as a Soviet "cultural envoy," visited the United States and bluntly said the thoughts of the Soviet revisionist leadership to the American imperialists: "You must understand the great role our two countries play. We should drive away the black cats that cause trouble between us. We should catch all the black cats that cause trouble between us and hang them on poles." Thus, Yevtushenko was "enthusiastically welcomed" by the war-monger McNamara. McNamara personally attended Yevtushenko's poetry recital and applauded the vicious slanders against China in Yevtushenko's "satirical poems," giving enthusiastic praise and cheers. The reporter of the Japanese *Mainichi Shimbun* reported Yevtushenko's anti-China and pro-American activities, writing: "The 'defeated youth' poet of the Soviet Union and the 'Vietnam War boss' of the United States have a poetic common feeling, as if there is a warm current under the ice." Enough, enough, what more needs to be said? The Soviet revisionist leadership sent this clown to the American masters to shake his tail and fiercely attack China, isn't this exposing their traitorous faces?

		Understanding Yevtushenko's shameful history, it is not difficult to understand why he is so afraid of and so hateful towards our country's Cultural Revolution. Yevtushenko and his ilk are genuine capitalist spies, genuine imperialist spies. The revolutionary people of the world, including the Soviet people, must shout at the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and their scoundrel poet Yevtushenko: "Capitalist spies, speak, what do you want to do?"

### 出卖灵魂的“诗人”

专栏：红卫兵谈天下大事

    出卖灵魂的“诗人”
    最近，在克里姆林宫老爷们亲自导演下愈演愈烈的反华大合唱中，又夹杂了几声特别刺耳的怪叫。原来是出卖灵魂的苏修下流“诗人”叶甫图申科，登台表演了一番。
    叶甫图申科在苏修《文学报》今年第七期上刊登了题为《红卫兵进行曲》和《听吧，“文化大革命的音乐”》的反动透顶的黑诗。他以最肮脏、最丑恶的思想和语言，恶毒咒骂、诬蔑我国的无产阶级文化大革命，攻击我国的红卫兵革命小将。
    让我们耐着性子听一听叶甫图申科的几声怪叫吧：
          “叫喊声，
        这是我们的音乐，
        人们，听吧！
        不关紧要的小事，
        喊成象慕尼黑一样。”
    叶甫图申科企图把史无前例的我国这场轰轰烈烈的文化大革命诬蔑为小题大作，好象是中国人民没事干了，竟为了一点点小事在那里“大喊大叫”。
    看来，这个修正主义的下流文人是在故意装糊涂。中国的文化大革命是“小事”吗？既然是这样，世界上的牛鬼蛇神，包括你叶甫图申科在内，为什么如此暴跳如雷呢？我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，一小撮赫鲁晓夫式的反革命修正主义分子，他们大搞资本主义复辟的舆论准备，进行大量反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的阴谋活动，中国的革命人民，当然不能等闲视之。在苏联，在伟大列宁的故乡，难道不是由于赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了政权、实行了资本主义复辟吗？叶甫图申科心里明白得很，这是大事，绝不是小事。苏联发生的这个历史的悲剧，是一个极其严重的教训。苏联和全世界革命人民是绝不会听信叶甫图申科的这一套谰言的。
    这个苏修下流“诗人”居然诬蔑我国的红卫兵“包围良心、包围正直！”
    住口！你们，苏修叛徒们，还有什么资格谈论“良心”和“正直”？！正是你们，同世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义勾结在一起，出卖苏联人民和世界革命人民的利益。正是你们，帮助美帝国主义这个大强盗去扼杀刚果（利）人民的独立，去扑灭越南人民的抗美救国斗争，去出卖多米尼加人民的革命。正是你们这伙可耻的叛徒，联合美帝国主义疯狂反对社会主义的中国。……一句话，你们的所谓“良心”，就是勾结美帝、为虎作伥、出卖世界革命！你们的所谓“正直”，就是宣布美帝国主义侵略有理，被压迫人民反抗有罪！你们这一伙无耻的叛徒，早就把自己的“良心”和灵魂统统廉价地出卖给美帝国主义了。
     叶甫图申科攻击我国红卫兵在国内向着反革命修正主义分子说：“资本主义的奸细，说吧，你们想干什么？”可爱的叶甫图申科先生，这下算你说对了。你给你的同类反革命修正主义分子，起了一个名副其实的好名字，叫做“资本主义的奸细”。正是这样，我们就是要在文化大革命中，把一小撮“资本主义的奸细”揪出来，打翻在地。中国人民向国内的“资本主义的奸细”怒斥一声，而苏修的大大小小“资本主义的奸细”就受不了。叶甫图申科跳将出来，气势汹汹地说：
  “哼！哼！竟然敢把我们的同类称为‘资本主义的奸细’，太不象话了，太不象话了！”
    “物以类聚，人以群分”。叶甫图申科是什么货色？揭开他的老底，就清楚了。叶甫图申科是在苏共二十大之后，由于猖狂反斯大林
  “功勋显著”，而成为苏修黑色文坛的一个名角儿的。这个出卖灵魂的小丑，自称当斯大林逝世时，“我象其他人一样哭泣”，可是泪痕未干，便紧紧跟在赫鲁晓夫屁股后面攻击起斯大林来了。他竟然利用法国资产阶级反动报刊《快报》发表《自传》。在《自传》中，他向帝国主义者表白，“我为斯大林感到可耻”，并把苏共二十大以后苏联的资本主义复辟称之为“非斯大林化的春天”。他甚至对伟大列宁所领导的俄国十月革命进行无耻的攻击。这个无耻文人的赤裸裸的叛徒行径，激起了苏联革命人民的愤慨。他们把叶甫图申科恰当地称为“知识分子流氓的思想领袖”、
  “肮脏事件的歌手”和“颓废的资产阶级分子”。正是这样一个下流文人，受到苏修领导集团的青睐，竟被提名为“列宁文学奖金”的候选人，并再度被捧上莫斯科作协理事的交椅。
    不仅如此，由于他大胆出卖自己的灵魂，他还讨得了美国主子的欢心。一九六六年年底，叶甫图申科以苏联“文化使节”身份访问美国时，露骨地说出了苏修领导集团的心里话。他对美帝国主义者说：“你们必须了解我们两国所起的巨大作用。我们应当赶走在我们之间捣乱的黑猫。我们应当抓住在我们之间捣乱的所有黑猫，把它们吊死在杆子上。”就这样，叶甫图申科受到战争贩子麦克纳马拉的“热烈欢迎”。麦克纳马拉亲临叶甫图申科的朗诵会，并且对叶甫图申科“讽刺诗”中对中国的恶毒诬蔑，不断鼓掌，热烈地报以赞扬和喝采。日本《每日新闻》的记者在报道叶甫图申科的反华媚美活动时写道：“苏联的‘战败青年’诗人同美国的越南战争大掌柜之间富有诗意的共同感情，好象是在冰下通着暖流”。够了，够了，还需要再加什么评论呢？苏修领导集团派了这名丑角到美国主子面前去摇头摆尾，大肆反华，不是把自己的叛徒嘴脸暴露无遗了吗？
    了解了叶甫图申科的丑史，人们也就不难明白为什么他对我国文化大革命那样害怕，那样的刻骨仇恨了。叶甫图申科之流就是地地道道的资本主义的奸细、地地道道的帝国主义的奸细。全世界革命人民，包括苏联人民在内，就是要向苏修叛徒集团和它的下流“诗人”叶甫图申科之流大喝一声：“资本主义的奸细，说吧，你们想干什么？”
