Vietnamese friends recently wrote an article titled "The Greatest Revolutionary Movement in Human History," enthusiastically praising China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The article says: "An unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping across China. As the Vietnamese people fighting on the frontline against American aggression, we rejoice wholeheartedly and warmly congratulate our Chinese comrades on the magnificent achievements they have made in this great revolutionary movement."

The article says: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is the greatest and most thorough proletarian revolutionary movement in human history."

"The greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time, Chairman Mao, has scientifically summarized the historical experience of the revolutions in the Soviet Union and China. He has analyzed the profound social roots of the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. He has clearly pointed out that in a socialist society, class struggle still exists, and there is the possibility of the restoration of capitalism and the transformation of the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China aims to fundamentally and thoroughly resolve the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road. This is a great and arduous struggle. It is not only related to the destiny and future of China but also to the success of our country's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and to the continued advancement of the proletarian cause worldwide. Therefore, whether one is willing to recognize the true purpose and significance of this great revolution in China and whether one supports or opposes this revolution has become the criterion to distinguish a true revolutionary from a false one."

The article says: "Now, imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership, along with various reactionaries worldwide, are hysterically slandering and attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, slandering and attacking the Red Guards. They even maliciously attack the great leader of contemporary China and the world revolutionary movement, Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought."

"Regarding the shameless slanders and attacks by imperialism and modern revisionism, our people and the revolutionary people of the world are not surprised. This is because imperialism and modern revisionism have formed a sacred alliance. They are not only the sworn enemies of the Chinese people but also the sworn enemies of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world."

"The imperialists and modern revisionists shamelessly slander and attack China's Cultural Revolution, saying it is terrible. We, on the other hand, fully support and enthusiastically praise China's Cultural Revolution, saying it is wonderful. We say China's Cultural Revolution is wonderful because it has thoroughly uprooted the social basis for the emergence of revisionism, prevented the restoration of capitalism in China, and further consolidated China's proletarian dictatorship and socialist system. Its victory will enable China to smoothly transition to a communist society and greatly accelerate the progress of our people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, as well as the revolutionary cause of the proletariat in various countries worldwide. This is the great historical merit of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world."

The article denounces the vicious attacks and insults by imperialism and modern revisionism against the Chinese Red Guards, pointing out that the Red Guards are the outstanding youths of the revolutionary masses of Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers. They were born and grew up in the storm of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have a strict organization, correct leadership, clear direction of struggle, firm will, and determination. From the moment of their birth, they have high held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taken Mao Zedong Thought as their guide to action, and taken the "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by Chairman Mao as their battle program. They are bravely and tenaciously fighting against the capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party and various ghosts and monsters. They have dug out all the time bombs planted by imperialism and modern revisionism in China without leaving a single one. They are an irresistible revolutionary torrent, sweeping away all the reactionary remnants left over from the old society, and cleansing the filth and garbage accumulated over thousands of years. The old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes have been swept away, replaced by the new ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the proletariat. Revolutionary people all over the world rejoice wholeheartedly and warmly congratulate their great victory.

The article says: "Imperialism and modern revisionism extremely hate and defame Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, which does not surprise us. Since the Soviet leadership completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism and became shameless revisionists, it is Chairman Mao who has high held the banner of opposing imperialism and modern revisionism, defending Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian revolutionary cause. In leading the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world in the fierce struggle against imperialism and revisionism, Chairman Mao has become the greatest revolutionary flag-bearer. Chairman Mao is the greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time, the great Lenin of the era when capitalism is heading towards complete doom and socialism is winning worldwide. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for the proletarian revolutionary cause of our time. This is a fact acknowledged by revolutionary people all over the world."

"The Vietnamese people, who have suffered immensely from imperialist oppression and exploitation, have deeply realized through extremely cruel struggles the great guiding role of Mao Zedong Thought, especially Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war, in our people's struggle against French colonialism and our current struggle against American aggression and for national salvation."

The article says: "At a time when Marxism-Leninism is facing mutilation due to the betrayal by the Soviet leadership, when the international communist movement is facing disintegration due to the betrayal by the Soviet leadership, when the proletarian revolutionary cause is facing serious damage due to the betrayal by the Soviet leadership, when the national liberation struggles of various countries are facing bloody suppression by imperialism due to the betrayal by the Soviet leadership, and when our struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is facing betrayal due to the betrayal by the Soviet leadership, humanity is fortunate to have Mao Zedong. It is the great Mao Zedong who has defended Marxism-Leninism, preventing its spirit from being mutilated; it is the great Mao Zedong who has saved the international communist movement, preventing its disintegration; it is the great Mao Zedong who has shouldered the burden of the proletarian revolutionary cause, preventing its damage; it is the great Mao Zedong who has rescued the national liberation cause of various countries from the bloodbath; it is the great Mao Zedong who has smashed various 'peace talks' tricks, preventing our struggle against American aggression and for national salvation from being betrayed."

The article concludes: "As the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world in the 1960s, Chairman Mao is truly worthy of the title. We, the Vietnamese people, and the revolutionary people of the world, feel incredibly fortunate and blessed to have a great Lenin—Mao Zedong—in our era. We sincerely wish our era's greatest teacher, greatest leader, greatest commander, and greatest helmsman, Chairman Mao, eternal life and good health, leading us to realize humanity's most sublime ideal—a communist society where there is no exploitation of man by man and no oppression of man by man."

    越南朋友热情赞颂毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命事业的指路明灯
    毛泽东主席是世界人民最伟大的革命旗手
    中国文化大革命是最伟大的最彻底的革命
    新华社河内二十一日电　越南朋友阮裴最近写了一篇题为《人类史上最伟大的革命运动》的文章，极为热情地赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    文章说：“一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命正在中国轰轰烈烈地展开着，作为在反美斗争最前线的越南人民，我们以无限喜悦的心情，热烈祝贺兄弟的中国人民在这一伟大的革命运动中所取得的辉煌成就。”
    文章说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是人类有史以来从未有过的最伟大、最彻底的无产阶级革命运动。”
    “当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席，科学地总结了苏联和中国革命的历史经验；分析了苏联和其它社会主义国家产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的深远社会根源，明确指出在社会主义社会里依然存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着资本主义复辟和无产阶级专政转化为资产阶级专政的可能性。
      “中国无产阶级文化大革命就是要在根本上彻底解决无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间的矛盾。这是一场伟大和艰巨的斗争，它不仅关系到中国的命运和前途，而且还关系到我国抗美救国事业是否能够获得胜利，关系到全世界无产阶级事业是否能够继续向前发展。因此，愿不愿意正视中国这场伟大革命的真正目的和意义以及对这场革命是坚决支持还是反对，就成为区别一个人是真革命还是假革命的标尺。”
    文章说：“现在，以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义以及世界上形形色色的反动派，正在歇斯底里地诬蔑和攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，诬蔑和攻击红卫兵，它们甚至恶毒地攻击当代中国和世界革命运动的伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想。
      “对于帝国主义和现代修正主义这种无耻的诬蔑和攻击，我国人民和世界革命人民是并不感到奇怪的，因为帝国主义和现代修正主义已结成神圣同盟，它们不但是中国人民的死敌，而且也是越南人民和世界革命人民的死敌。
      “帝国主义和现代修正主义无耻地诬蔑和攻击中国的文化大革命，说中国文化大革命糟得很，我们偏偏要全力支持和热烈赞扬中国文化大革命，说中国文化大革命好得很。我们说中国文化大革命好得很，是因为它彻底铲除了产生修正主义的社会基础，防止了资本主义在中国的复辟，并进一步巩固了中国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度。它的胜利，将使中国顺利地过渡到共产主义社会，同时大大加速我国人民抗美救国事业和世界各国无产阶级革命事业的历史进程，这是中国人民和世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的伟大历史功勋。”
    文章痛斥帝国主义和现代修正主义对中国红卫兵的恶毒攻击和谩骂，指出红卫兵都是中国工农兵革命群众的优秀子弟，他们是在中国文化大革命暴风雨中诞生和成长的，他们有严密的组织，有正确的领导，有明确的斗争方向，有坚强的意志和决心。他们从诞生之日起，就高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛泽东思想为行动指南，以毛主席亲自领导制订的“十六条”为战斗纲领，坚决同混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派和形形色色的牛鬼蛇神进行英勇顽强的斗争，把帝国主义和现代修正主义在中国埋下的所有定时炸弹，一个不留地全部挖掉。他们是一股不可抗拒的革命洪流，冲垮了旧社会遗留下来的一切反动残余势力，荡涤了几千年堆积起来的污泥浊水和垃圾秽物。剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，被他们一扫而光，代之以无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。全世界的革命人民，都以无限喜悦的心情热烈祝贺他们的伟大胜利。
    文章说：“帝国主义和现代修正主义极端仇视和诋毁毛主席和毛泽东思想，这并不使我们感到愕然，因为自从苏共领导集团彻底背叛了马克思列宁主义而沦为无耻的修正主义者之后，正是毛主席高高举起反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的革命旗帜，捍卫了马克思列宁主义和无产阶级革命事业。在领导中国人民和世界革命人民进行反帝、反修的激烈斗争中，毛主席成为最伟大的革命旗手，毛主席是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家，是资本主义走向彻底灭亡、社会主义在全世界赢得胜利时代的伟大的列宁。毛泽东思想是当代无产阶级革命事业的指路明灯。这是全世界革命人民一致公认的事实。
    “饱受帝国主义压迫和剥削的越南人民，从无比残酷的斗争中，深刻地认识到毛泽东思想、特别是毛主席关于人民战争的伟大思想对我国人民的抗法斗争和目前正在进行的抗美救国斗争的伟大指导作用。”
    文章说：“在马克思列宁主义因苏共领导集团的叛变而面临着被阉割的时候，在国际共产主义运动因苏共领导集团的叛变而面临着被瓦解的时候，在无产阶级革命事业因苏共领导集团的叛变而遭到严重破坏的时候，在各国民族解放斗争因苏共领导集团的叛变而遭受帝国主义的血腥镇压的时候，在我国抗美救国事业因苏共领导集团的叛变而面临着被出卖的时候，人类幸而有个毛泽东。是伟大的毛泽东捍卫了马克思列宁主义使其精神不被阉割；是伟大的毛泽东挽救了国际共产主义运动使其不被瓦解；是伟大的毛泽东肩负起无产阶级革命事业的重担使其不被破坏；是伟大的毛泽东把各国民族解放事业从血泊中挽救出来；是伟大的毛泽东粉碎了形形色色的‘和谈’阴谋诡计，使我国的抗美救国事业不被出卖。”
    文章最后说：“作为二十世纪六十年代全世界无产阶级和革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手，毛主席是当之无愧的。我们越南人民和全世界革命人民，都因我们时代有个伟大的列宁——毛泽东而感到无比庆幸和莫大幸福。我们衷心敬祝我们时代最伟大的导师、最伟大的领袖、最伟大的统帅、最伟大的舵手毛主席万寿无疆，领导我们实现人类最崇高的理想——没有人剥削人、没有人压迫人的共产主义社会。”
