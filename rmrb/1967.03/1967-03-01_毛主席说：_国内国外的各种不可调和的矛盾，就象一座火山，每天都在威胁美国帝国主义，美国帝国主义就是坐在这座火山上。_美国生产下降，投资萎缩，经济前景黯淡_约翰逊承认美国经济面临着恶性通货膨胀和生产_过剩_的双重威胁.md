Chairman Mao says: "Domestic and international contradictions that cannot be reconciled are like a volcano, threatening U.S. imperialism every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano."

The U.S. is experiencing a decline in production, a contraction in investment, and a bleak economic outlook. Johnson admits that the U.S. economy is facing the dual threats of severe inflation and overproduction.

Our correspondent reports: U.S. industrial production has recently seen a significant drop. According to the Federal Reserve Board's announcement on February 16, the U.S. industrial production index fell from 158.9 (based on the average industrial production from 1957-1959 as 100) to 157.9 in January, a drop of one point, the steepest decline since the auto workers' strike in October 1964. The sectors experiencing the most significant declines are automobiles, steel, and durable consumer goods. More importantly, orders for automobiles and durable consumer goods simultaneously dropped by 5.1%. This indicates that inventory in these sectors is already excessive, and serious overproduction has occurred.

The reason for this situation is that the automobile, construction, and steel industries, which are crucial pillars of the U.S. economy, are all facing sales difficulties. The auto industry has repeatedly announced production cuts to adapt to market conditions, resulting in a total production decrease of 8% compared to 1965. Currently, sales are not improving but are becoming even more bleak. Reports indicate that the two major U.S. auto companies, Chrysler and Ford, have decided to reduce production. It is estimated that U.S. auto production in the first quarter of this year will decrease by 20% compared to the same period last year.

The construction sector is not much better off. Construction business hit its lowest point since the end of World War II in October last year. Although there has been a slight improvement in the construction sector, the outlook remains very bleak.

Under the influence of production cuts in the auto and construction industries, the steel industry has also had to contract. In the second half of last year, U.S. steel inventories actually increased significantly. This year's steel production will obviously be lower than last year's level.

Over the past few months, the decline in new orders for durable consumer goods, the decline in machine tool orders, and the stagnation or decline in retail trade all indicate that industrial production will further shrink.

The contraction of investment by U.S. monopolistic capital also signals a bleak economic outlook for this year. Due to the blind expansion of factory equipment over the past few years, the phenomenon of severe overproduction has re-emerged in U.S. enterprises. This has forced monopolistic capital to significantly reduce capital expenditures. In 1966, the total capital expenditure of U.S. business owners in each quarter was over $2 billion. However, in the first half of 1967, the capital expenditure in each quarter is estimated to be less than $1 billion. It is said that this will continue to decrease in the second half of the year.

Capitalist "prosperity" has always relied on the "investment boom" of monopolistic capital. The disappearance of this "boom" indicates that the economy is approaching a crisis.

The enormous expenditure of the Vietnam War has caused a huge budget deficit and severe inflation in the U.S. Even based on official figures, the price increase of consumer goods last year was three times the average price increase of the previous five years. This has significantly weakened the purchasing power of the people, accelerating the arrival of the market crisis.

Not only that, the large outflow of dollars to South Vietnam has further worsened the U.S.'s international balance of payments. In 1966, the U.S.'s international balance of payments deficit again reached $142.4 million, surpassing the 1965 level. Its gold reserves have recently dropped to the lowest point in 28 years: $1.319 billion. This has made the Johnson administration worried about the possibility of a dollar crisis.

Johnson acknowledged in his annual economic report submitted to the U.S. Congress on January 26 that due to the serious impact of the Vietnam War on U.S. finances and the economy, in the new year, the U.S. economy will face the dual threats of severe inflation and overproduction. He said that the U.S. economy currently has a series of "serious" problems, "whether it is the threat of inflation or the threat of recession, ... they have never been distant."

    毛主席说：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
    美国生产下降，投资萎缩，经济前景黯淡
    约翰逊承认美国经济面临着恶性通货膨胀和生产“过剩”的双重威胁
    本报讯　美国工业生产最近出现了大幅度下跌。据美国联邦储备局二月十六日宣布，一月份美国工业生产指数从一五八点九（以一九五七——一九五九年的工业生产平均数为一百）跌到了一五七点九，下跌了整整一点，是一九六四年十月汽车工人大罢工以来跌得最猛的一个月。生产下跌最厉害的部门是汽车、钢铁、家庭用具等耐用消费商品。更重要的是汽车、家庭用具等耐用消费商品的订货竟同时下跌了百分之五点一。这表明，这些部门的存货已经过多，已出现了严重“过剩”。
    所以会出现这种情况是因为作为美国经济重要支柱的汽车、建筑和钢铁三个部门，销售都出现困难。汽车工业去年为适应市场情况就曾一再宣布削减生产，使汽车总产量比一九六五年下降了百分之八。目前销路不但没有好转，反而更趋黯淡。据报道，美国两家大汽车公司“克莱斯勒汽车公司”和“福特汽车公司”已决定减产。估计今年第一季美国汽车产量比一年前将减少百分之二十。
    建筑部门的情况，也不比汽车业好多少。建筑业的业务在去年十月降到了第二次世界大战结束以来的最低水平。目前建筑业虽稍有起色，但是前景仍然十分黯淡。
    在汽车业和建筑业这两个最大的钢材主顾相继减产的影响下，钢铁工业也不得不相应地进行收缩。去年下半年，美国钢铁存货实际上已经大量增加。今年钢铁产量显然将低于去年的水平。
    几个月来，美国耐用消费品工业新订货的下降，机床工业订货的下降，零售贸易额的停滞或下降，也都表明工业生产将进一步萎缩。
    美国垄断资本投资的萎缩，同样预示了今年经济前景的黯淡。由于几年来的盲目扩大厂房设备，目前生产能力严重“过剩”现象又在美国企业界普遍出现。这使垄断资本不能不大大减少资本支出。一九六六年美国企业主每季度的资本支出总数都在二十亿美元以上。但是，一九六七年上半年每季度的资本支出，估计还不到十亿美元。下半年据说还将继续减少。
    资本主义的“繁荣”从来就是依靠垄断资本的
  “投资热潮”的。这种“热潮”的消失表明，经济正在临近一次危机。
    侵越战争的庞大开支，已在美国国内造成了巨大的预算赤字和严重的通货膨胀恶果。即使根据官方数字，去年美国消费品价格上涨幅度竟等于前五年物价平均上涨幅度的三倍。这就大大削弱了人民的购买力，加快市场危机的到来。
    不但这样，大量美元的流往南越，还使美国国际收支状况更加恶化。一九六六年美国的国际收支逆差又高达十四亿二千四百万美元，再次超过了一九六五年。它的黄金储备最近更跌到二十八年来的最低点：一百三十一亿零九百万美元。这就使约翰逊政府不能不为爆发美元危机捏一把汗。
    约翰逊在一月二十六日提交给美国国会的年度经济报告中承认，由于侵越战争对美国财政经济产生的严重影响，在新的一年中，美国经济将受到恶性通货膨胀和生产过剩的双重威胁。他说，美国经济目前存在着一系列“严重的”问题，“无论是通货膨胀的威胁，还是衰退的威胁，……从来都不是遥远的。”
