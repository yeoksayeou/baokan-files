Our Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union sternly refutes the Soviet revisionist authorities' slander and defamation of our embassy

The Soviet revisionists' worsening of relations and their frantic anti-China actions will not end well.

The activities of our embassy in the Soviet Union and its staff are all above board, and they have made many contributions to developing the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The Soviet revisionists' anti-China actions will not pass among the Soviet people.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, MOSCOW, March 21 — Deputy Director of the Far Eastern Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Malosin, summoned China's Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, An Zhi Yuan, on the afternoon of the 18th, and read out a "statement" from the Soviet Foreign Ministry, which viciously attacked our embassy's normal diplomatic activities, falsely accusing the embassy of engaging in so-called "anti-Soviet activities," and unreasonably declaring that First Secretary Miu Qun and Third Secretary Sun Lin are "unwelcome persons." This is another new step taken by the Soviet authorities to deliberately worsen relations between China and the Soviet Union and to restrict and sabotage our embassy's normal activities.

	An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires, immediately rejected and strongly protested the Soviet Foreign Ministry's "statement."

	An Zhi Yuan sternly pointed out: "The Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement is a complete distortion of facts and slander, which is completely untenable. I am indignant and strongly protest against this Soviet action that damages Sino-Soviet relations."

	An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires, also gave a powerful refutation to the Soviet government's slander and defamation of our embassy's normal activities.

	An Zhi Yuan said: "The behavior of the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union and its staff is above board. They have made many contributions to developing the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples in the past and present. All our activities are in accordance with international customs and international legal norms and are beyond reproach. We have always abided by the laws of the host country and there is no question of interfering in Soviet internal affairs. All our activities are in line with our diplomatic status. Your accusations of us being anti-Soviet and hostile to the Soviet Union are pure fabrications."

	An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires, cited facts to expose the Soviet government's bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe on January 25, and the instigation of hooligans to storm our embassy in the Soviet Union on February 3, beating up Chinese diplomatic representatives and staff members. An Zhi Yuan then pointed out: "After the October Revolution, imperialist elements once beat up diplomatic personnel of the Soviet state, and the Indonesian fascist right-wing military clique also once took such action against Chinese diplomatic personnel. Now you are doing the same. Don't you feel ashamed?"

	An Zhi Yuan pointed out that, at the request of foreign students in the Soviet Union, the Chinese embassy invited them to watch a movie and, at their request, had conversations with them, introducing the situation in China. This was a completely legal and normal diplomatic activity. As for the Chinese embassy inviting compatriots in the Soviet Union to watch a movie and talk about the situation in their homeland, this is an internal matter of China and is a completely normal activity of the consular department of the Chinese embassy. However, it must be pointed out that the reception for Chinese New Year held by the embassy on February 4 was sabotaged by the Soviet government. You actually obstructed compatriots from coming to attend the reception and even forcibly tied up and took away compatriots who came to the embassy to attend the reception at the gate of our embassy.

	When talking about the Soviet Foreign Ministry's attack on the issue of Chinese embassy personnel not going to the Soviet Foreign Ministry at the appointed time for meetings, An Zhi Yuan said: "What right do you have to summon me at any time you want, and I must go? Everyone has their own arrangements and activities. The time for a meeting should be agreed upon by both sides. On the contrary, in this regard, it is the Soviet Foreign Ministry that should be blamed. You not only frequently postpone the meeting times proposed by the Chinese embassy, but sometimes you simply do not grant meetings. I have personally gone to your Foreign Ministry hall twice to request urgent meetings and have been unreasonably rejected by you."

	An Zhi Yuan emphasized: "All the facts prove that the activities of the Chinese embassy are above board. Your slander of the embassy can only show that you intend to further worsen relations between the two countries and further restrict and sabotage the normal activities of the embassy."

	An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires, also said: "Our embassy's First Secretary Miu Qun and Third Secretary Sun Lin are both diplomatic personnel educated under the thought of Mao Zedong, and their behavior is completely in accordance with international legal norms. They have done a lot of beneficial work for the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Now you are expelling them on trumped-up charges. This does not show your strength but your weakness. We are convinced that the Chinese and Soviet peoples will forever be friendly, and this friendship cannot be destroyed by anyone. Your anti-China actions will not pass among the Soviet people and will not end well."

    我驻苏临时代办严正驳斥苏修当局对我使馆的诽谤诬蔑
    苏修恶化两国关系疯狂反华决没有好下场
    我驻苏使馆和工作人员的一切活动都是光明磊落的，他们为发展中苏人民的友谊作出很多贡献；苏修的反华行动在苏联人民中是通不过的。
    新华社莫斯科二十一日电　苏联外交部远东司副司长马洛辛十八日下午约见中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远时，宣读了苏联外交部一份“声明”，恶毒攻击我国大使馆的正常的外交活动，大肆诬蔑大使馆从事所谓“反苏活动”，并且无理宣布大使馆一等秘书缪群和三等秘书孙林为所谓“不受欢迎的人”。这是苏联当局蓄意进一步恶化中苏两国关系、限制和破坏我国大使馆正常活动的又一个新的步骤。安致远临时代办当即对苏联外交部的“声明”表示坚决的拒绝和强烈的抗议。
    安致远严正指出：“苏联外交部的声明颠倒黑白，造谣诬蔑，是完全站不住脚的，我对此表示愤慨，强烈抗议苏方这个破坏中苏两国关系的行动。”
    安致远临时代办并对苏联政府针对我国大使馆的正常活动所作的诬蔑诽谤给予了有力的驳斥。
    安致远说：“中国驻苏联大使馆和大使馆的工作人员的行为都是光明磊落的，他们对发展中苏两国人民的友谊过去和现在都作了很多贡献。我们的一切活动都是符合国际惯例的，符合国际法准则的，是无可非议的。我们一贯遵守驻在国的法令，根本谈不上什么干涉苏联内政的问题。我们的一切活动都是同我们的外交地位相符合的。你们诬蔑我们反苏、敌视苏联，这纯属捏造。”
    安致远临时代办列举事实，揭露苏联政府在一月二十五日出动军警血腥镇压中国留欧学生，又在二月三日指使暴徒闯进我国驻苏联大使馆，毒打中国外交代表和工作人员的法西斯暴行。安致远接着指出：“十月革命后，帝国主义分子曾经殴打过苏维埃国家的外交人员，印尼法西斯右派军人集团也曾对中国的外交人员采取过这种行动。现在你们竟然也这样做，难道你们不感到耻辱吗？”
    安致远指出，根据外国留苏学生的要求，中国大使馆邀请他们来看电影，并且根据他们的请求，同他们交谈，介绍中国的情况，这完全是合法的正常外交活动。至于中国大使馆请在苏联的本国侨民来看电影，谈祖国的情况，那更是中国的内部事务，完全是中国大使馆领事部门的正常活动。但是，必须指出，二月四日大使馆举行的华侨春节招待会，却遭到了苏联政府的破坏。你们居然阻拦华侨前来参加招待会，甚至在我国大使馆门前把前来使馆参加招待会的华侨强行绑走。
    安致远在谈到苏联外交部在“声明”中攻击我国大使馆人员没有在苏联外交部所指定的约见时间去苏联外交部的问题时说：“你们有什么理由约我什么时候到外交部，我就必须什么时候到呢？每个人都有自己的安排，都有自己的活动。约见时间应该是双方同意的。相反，在这一方面应当受到指责的不是我们，而是苏联外交部。你们不但经常推迟中国大使馆提出的约见时间，而且有时就根本不予会见。我就曾两次亲自到你们外交部大厅要求过紧急约见，而遭到你们的无理拒绝。”
    安致远强调说：“所有的事实证明，中国大使馆的活动是正大光明的。你们对大使馆的诬蔑只能表明你们企图还要进一步恶化两国关系，进一步限制、破坏大使馆的正常活动”。
    安致远临时代办还说：“我国大使馆一等秘书缪群和三等秘书孙林，都是在毛泽东思想教育下的外交人员，他们的行为是完全符合国际法准则的，他们为中苏两国人民的友谊做了很多有益的工作。现在你们以莫须有的借口驱逐他们，这并不能表明你们的强大，而是表明你们的虚弱。我们深信，中苏两国人民是要永远友好下去的，这种友谊是任何人破坏不了的。你们的反华行动在苏联人民当中是通不过的，是不会有好下场的。”
