South Vietnamese Liberation Army's Striking Victory: Heavy Bombardment of Da Nang U.S. Airbase

Over a thousand U.S. troops annihilated, 94 U.S. planes destroyed

Binh Dinh Liberation Army annihilates an entire enemy battalion in 25 minutes; 85 enemy vehicles destroyed in ambush on Highway 1

According to a supplementary report from the South Vietnamese Liberation Communications Agency, on the night of February 27, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces launched a heavy bombardment on the Da Nang U.S. airbase. The battle resulted in the annihilation of over a thousand U.S. invaders and the destruction of 94 enemy planes and over 200 military vehicles.

The bombardment accurately struck the airbase's radio communication center, radar station, runway, and various buildings including U.S. barracks and clubs, turning the entire base into a sea of fire. The radio communication and radar equipment within the base were completely destroyed, forcing the base to shut down. As of March 6, jet planes were still unable to take off or land.

According to a report from the South Vietnamese Liberation Communications Agency, on March 21, the Liberation Armed Forces in Binh Dinh Province fought a brilliant annihilation battle, completely wiping out an enemy battalion and seizing all their weapons and military supplies.

The report stated that after the U.S.-puppet forces' "sweep" operation in Phu Loc Commune, Phu Cat District, Binh Dinh Province on March 20 failed, they sent another battalion to continue the "sweep" on March 21. That morning, as soon as the enemy troops began their march, the local Liberation Armed Forces, who were well-prepared, launched a fierce ambush. After just 25 minutes of intense battle, the entire enemy battalion was annihilated.

The report said that since the beginning of this year, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces have already annihilated nine enemy main force battalions.

According to news from Saigon, on the night of March 24, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces fought a brilliant ambush battle on Highway 1, achieving a great victory by destroying and damaging 85 U.S.-puppet military vehicles.

According to Western news agencies, the battle took place on the section of Highway 1 from Da Nang to Qui Nhon. The Liberation Armed Forces first used landmines to destroy three U.S. military vehicles, killing and wounding a batch of U.S. invaders. They then successfully ambushed a puppet military convoy. Preliminary reports indicated that 82 enemy vehicles were destroyed and severely damaged, and many puppet drivers were killed and wounded. The battalion escorting the convoy also suffered casualties. According to reports, this convoy was ambushed while returning to Da Nang after transporting puppet troops to Quang Ngai.

Another report stated that on March 24, in the battles in Quang Tri Province, the Liberation Armed Forces used fierce ground artillery fire to shoot down seven U.S. Marine Corps helicopters.
