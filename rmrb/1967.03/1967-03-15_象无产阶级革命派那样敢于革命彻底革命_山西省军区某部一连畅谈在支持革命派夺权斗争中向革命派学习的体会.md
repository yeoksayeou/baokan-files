The soldiers of the 1st Company of a certain unit under the Shanxi Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, who have fully supported the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanxi Province in seizing power, recently held a symposium to discuss their experiences in supporting and assisting the proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great directive that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left.

At the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanxi Province united and implemented the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the soldiers of the 1st Company, under the leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, stood up and firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction. In the fight alongside the proletarian revolutionary faction, the soldiers of the 1st Company personally felt the brave and tenacious fighting spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and saw with their own eyes the tremendous power of the proletarian revolutionary faction's great unity. The soldiers said: "The battlefield of supporting and assisting the proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power is the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The true proletarian revolutionary faction is a new force nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. They embody the revolutionary direction and are our models to learn from!"

	Learning the Spirit of Daring to Revolutionize and Thoroughly Revolutionize from the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction

At the symposium, the soldiers of the 1st Company enthusiastically praised the revolutionary firmness and thoroughness shown by the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanxi Province in the struggle to seize power, and unanimously expressed their determination to forever learn from the spirit of daring to revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize from the proletarian revolutionary faction. Platoon Leader Tan Cong'an, who had fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary faction while guarding the Shanxi Provincial Communications Bureau, said that in mid-January, the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanxi Province united to seize the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial People's Committee, Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee, and Municipal People's Committee. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the Taiyuan Municipal Communications Bureau, in order to save their doomed fate, used their controlled organizations to incite deceived masses and hastily staged a fake seizure of power farce, attempting to use this important communications organ as their black underground intelligence station for desperate resistance. The proletarian revolutionary faction in the Communications Bureau, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, promptly exposed the enemy's tricks, firmly saying: "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but the revolutionary power cannot be lost!" They immediately bravely stood up and fought resolutely against the class enemy. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road incited a part of the deceived masses to attack the proletarian revolutionary faction and fabricated black materials to label the revolutionary mass organizations as "counter-revolutionary groups," threatening to "settle accounts later." In this situation, the proletarian revolutionary faction remained unshakable, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," greatly enhancing their fighting will and fighting more resolutely against the class enemy.

Staff Officer Zhang Youxiang of the Shanxi Provincial Military Region Command, who supported the proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power together with the soldiers of the 1st Company, said that the proletarian revolutionary faction's brave and tenacious fighting will and daring to revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize in the fierce class struggle are very worthy of our learning. He said that on January 13, the "Preservation" faction, controlled by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, staged a fake seizure of power in the Taiyuan Municipal Communications Bureau and immediately directed their struggle against the proletarian revolutionary faction, implementing white terror. They relied on the power they had seized to demote some firm revolutionary leftists from their positions as team and squad leaders under the pretext of merging departments, and threatened the revolutionary masses by withholding their wages. However, the proletarian revolutionary faction, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, remained unshakable to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to seize back the revolutionary power. After a period of arduous struggle, with the great assistance of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanxi Province and the troops, they finally smashed the counterattack of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and firmly seized the power of the Communications Bureau, achieving a great victory in the struggle to seize power.

	Learning the High Policy and Discipline Consciousness from the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction

The soldiers of the 1st Company unanimously agreed that the broad proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanxi Province, in the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, not only dared to struggle and dared to win, but also knew how to struggle and how to win. They acted according to the directives of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and firmly implemented the Sixteen Points. This high policy and discipline consciousness is also a good example for us to learn from. The soldiers said that when the power of the proletarian revolutionary faction was still at a disadvantage and the struggle was extremely arduous, they took Chairman Mao's teaching that "policy and strategy are the life of the Party" as their motto. On one hand, they thoroughly criticized selfishness and established public-mindedness, correctly treated revolutionary leading cadres, and insisted on uniting with all genuine proletarian revolutionary factions under the invincible red flag of Mao Zedong Thought to achieve the broadest and closest great unity. On the other hand, they held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, awakening the deceived masses, and quickly bringing them back to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Platoon Leader Sha Baosheng said: In January, when the revolutionary storm to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road swept across the province, we were on a mission in the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee. At that time, the proletarian revolutionary faction in this unit had only seven or eight people. In the struggle, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," as well as relevant editorials from "Red Flag" magazine and "People's Daily." They realized that to achieve victory in the struggle to seize power, the key was to thoroughly criticize selfishness and achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Thus, they carried out a thorough revolution in their souls, thoroughly criticized individualism, removed the word "fear," and put "dare" first, following Chairman Mao's teachings to actively connect with other revolutionary organizations to make a revolution together. Through a series of painstaking and meticulous work, they expanded the revolutionary organization and implemented the great unity with the revolutionary organizations in Taiyuan City, seizing the various powers held by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee. After seizing power, they actively helped the deceived masses, quickly awakening them. The conservative forces quickly collapsed, the revolutionary forces further expanded, and the number of people increased from more than twenty at the time of seizing power to more than one hundred and fifty.

Model Soldier Hao Jingfu said: "What is even more worthy of our learning is that the proletarian revolutionary faction, in the sharp and complex class struggle, can maintain a clear mind, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directives and the Party's policies, thus ensuring the victory of the struggle."

	The Most Important Thing is to Learn the Deep Class Feelings of the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction

What force makes the proletarian revolutionary faction fearless and so brave and tenacious? What force makes the proletarian revolutionary faction smart and brave in the struggle, good at struggling, and good at winning? The soldiers of the 1st Company, who fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary faction, deeply felt that it was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, because the proletarian revolutionary faction was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loved Mao Zedong Thought; because they insisted on reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's directives in the fierce class struggle. The most important and fundamental thing to learn from the proletarian revolutionary faction is to learn their proletarian revolutionary feelings of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Model Soldier Wang Quanyou said: The more the broad revolutionary masses in Shanxi Province struggled, the more they were thirsty to study Chairman Mao's works and drew endless strength from them. At the most arduous time of the struggle, the proletarian revolutionary faction in the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee often worked day and night, forgetting to sleep and eat, but they never forgot to study Chairman Mao's works. They said with full confidence: "Food can be left un eaten, sleep can be left unhad, but Chairman Mao's works cannot be left unstudied."

Li Fengming, a model soldier in studying Chairman Mao's works and a platoon leader, said: "Comparison makes one enlightened. In the past, I only thought that my study of Chairman Mao's works was good and had been praised; compared with the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, I felt the gap was huge." He said that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the Shanxi Provincial People's Bank, which they guarded, were faithful followers of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. When the revolutionary masses wrote big-character posters to expose the crimes of these people, they used fascist methods to suppress and threaten the revolutionary masses, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames. At the most arduous time of the struggle, the revolutionary masses studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "Our comrades, in times of difficulty, should see achievements, see light, and enhance our courage." Their fighting spirit soared, and they fought braver and stronger, smashing the counterattacks of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road one after another. They said: "With Chairman Mao by our side, we fear nothing, can overcome any difficulty, and can defeat any enemy."

At the symposium, the soldiers expressed their determination to be like the proletarian revolutionary faction, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, and wholeheartedly becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

	Only by Fighting Together with the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Can We Truly Learn Their Revolutionary Spirit

How can we truly learn the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction? The soldiers of this company said at the symposium that Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can we truly learn." Only by firmly following Chairman Mao's teachings, throwing ourselves into the fiery revolutionary struggle, resolutely, wholeheartedly, and unambiguously supporting and assisting the proletarian revolutionary faction's united seizure of power, breathing together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, sharing their fate, thinking what the proletarian revolutionary faction thinks, worrying about what the proletarian revolutionary faction worries about, and taking the proletarian revolutionary faction's mission as our own, can we truly learn from the proletarian revolutionary faction and truly learn their revolutionary spirit.

Soldier Meng Deming said: In the fight together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, the proletarian revolutionary faction's spirit of treating Mao Zedong Thought as their first life, fearing no hardship, fearing no fatigue, bravely and tenaciously, and unyieldingly, educated me every moment. In a mission to support the proletarian revolutionary faction, we rushed forward at full speed. My legs, suffering from arthritis, started to hurt after running a distance. Under the inspiration of the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction, I recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." I persisted and ran to the destination. After completing the mission and returning, my legs were swollen and painful, but I thought of the political and ideological gains from fighting with the revolutionary masses, and I was full of joy, forgetting the pain in my joints.

The soldiers said that in the struggle to seize power, we always fought together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, won together, and saw with our own eyes the high enthusiasm and great momentum of the proletarian revolutionary faction in studying Chairman Mao's works. They used Chairman Mao's class analysis perspective to observe the situation, analyze the situation, and make correct judgments to guide their revolutionary actions. Inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction, we immediately took practical actions to learn from them. Although we had fewer people and heavier tasks, we insisted on taking out time to go to the masses to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, exposing the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. As a result, the forces of the proletarian revolutionary faction became stronger and stronger, the deceived masses quickly awakened, and returned to the correct line represented by Chairman Mao, greatly isolating and striking the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In the days of fighting together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, we more deeply felt the great power of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and our determination and self-awareness to learn from the proletarian revolutionary faction became greater.

    象无产阶级革命派那样敢于革命彻底革命
    山西省军区某部一连畅谈在支持革命派夺权斗争中向革命派学习的体会
    新华社太原十四日电  全力支持山西省无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争伟大胜利的人民解放军山西省军区某部一连，最近举行座谈会，畅谈他们坚决执行毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的伟大指示，在支持和援助无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，向无产阶级革命派学习的体会。
    在山西省无产阶级革命派大联合，实行革命的“三结合”，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开夺权斗争的关键时刻，一连指战员在山西省军区的领导下，挺身而出，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，坚决支持了无产阶级革命派。在同无产阶级革命派一起战斗中，一连指战员亲身感受到无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想指引下勇敢顽强的斗争精神，亲眼看到了无产阶级革命派大联合的巨大威力。指战员们说：“支持和援助无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的战场，是活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂。真正的无产阶级革命派，是毛泽东思想哺育起来的新生力量，他们体现了革命的大方向，是我们学习的榜样！”
      学习无产阶级革命派敢于革
  命、彻底革命的精神
    在座谈会上，一连指战员热烈赞扬山西省无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争中表现出来的革命坚定性和彻底性，一致表示要永远学习无产阶级革命派敢于革命、彻底革命的精神。在守卫山西省电信局时和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗过的班长谭从安说，一月中旬，山西省无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺了省委、省人委、太原市委、市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的党、政、财、文大权后，太原市电信局党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了挽救自己覆灭的命运，利用他们操纵的组织，挑拨受蒙蔽的群众，急急忙忙地演出了一幕假夺权丑剧，妄图把这个重要的电信机关当作他们负隅顽抗的黑色地下情报站。用毛泽东思想武装起来的电信局的无产阶级革命派，及时识破了敌人的阴谋诡计，他们牢记毛主席关于革命的根本问题是政权问题的教导，坚定地说：“头可断，血可流，革命大权不可丢！”立即勇敢地站出来，和阶级敌人展开了坚决的斗争。党内走资本主义道路的当权派操纵一部分受蒙蔽的群众，对无产阶级革命派进行围攻，并无中生有地整理黑材料，把革命群众组织打成“反革命集团”，扬言要“秋后算帐”。在这种情况下，无产阶级革命派毫不动摇，反复学习了毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，大大增强了斗争意志，更加坚决地和阶级敌人展开针锋相对的斗争。
    和一连指战员一起支援无产阶级革命派夺权的山西省军区司令部参谋张有祥说，无产阶级革命派在激烈的阶级斗争中所表现的英勇顽强的战斗意志，和敢于革命、彻底革命的无产阶级革命胆略，非常值得我们学习。他说，一月十三日，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵的保字号组织，在太原市电信局进行假夺权之后，立刻把斗争矛头指向无产阶级革命派，实行白色恐怖。他们依仗窃夺的大权，借合并科室为名，撤了一些坚定的革命左派的班、组长职务，并且用克扣工资的手段来威胁革命群众。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为了夺回革命大权，毫不动摇。经过一段艰苦的斗争，在山西省无产阶级革命派和部队的大力援助下，他们终于粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反扑，把电信局的大权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手中，取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利。
      学习无产阶级革命派按毛主
  席指示办事的高度政策纪律观念
    一连指战员一致认为，山西广大无产阶级革命派在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，不仅敢于斗争，敢于胜利，而且善于斗争，善于胜利，按照毛主席和党中央的指示办事，坚决贯彻执行十六条。这种高度的政策纪律观念，也是我们学习的好榜样。指战员们说，当无产阶级革命派的力量还处于劣势，斗争极其艰苦的时候，他们把毛主席的“政策和策略是党的生命”的教导当作座右铭，一面大破私字，大立公字，正确对待革命的领导干部，坚持和一切真正的无产阶级革命派在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下团结起来，实现最广泛、最紧密的大联合；一面高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛泽东思想为武器，揭露、批判山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，唤醒受蒙蔽的群众，使他们迅速回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    班长沙宝生说：一月份，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的革命风暴席卷全省时，我们在太原市委执行任务，这个单位的无产阶级革命派开始只有七、八个人，他们在斗争中反复学习毛主席的《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，以及《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》等有关社论，认识到要取得夺权斗争的胜利，关键在于大破私心，实现无产阶级革命派的大联合。于是，他们就在灵魂深处大闹革命，大挖个人主义，去掉“怕”字，“敢”字当头，按照毛主席的教导，主动串连其他革命组织一起闹革命。经过一系列艰苦细致的工作，壮大了革命组织，并和太原市的革命组织实行了大联合，夺了太原市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所把持的种种大权。夺权后，他们就积极地帮助受蒙蔽的群众，使这些群众很快觉悟过来，保守派迅速土崩瓦解，革命队伍进一步壮大，由夺权时的二十多人发展到了一百五十多人。
    五好战士郝景福说：“更值得我们学习的是，无产阶级革命派在尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中，能够保持清醒的头脑，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，坚决地执行毛主席的指示和党的方针政策，因而保证了斗争的胜利。”
      最最重要的是学习无产阶级
  革命派无限忠于毛主席，无限热
  爱毛泽东思想的深厚的阶级感情
    是什么力量使无产阶级革命派天不怕，地不怕，这样勇敢顽强？又是什么力量使无产阶级革命派在斗争中智勇双全，善于斗争，善于胜利？和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗的一连指战员深深体会到：是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是因为无产阶级革命派无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想；是因为他们在激烈的阶级斗争中，坚持读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。向无产阶级革命派学习，最重要的、最根本的，是学习他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命感情。
    五好战士王全有说：山西省广大革命群众越是在斗争最艰苦的时候，越是如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，从毛主席著作中吸取了无穷无尽的力量。斗争最艰苦的时候，太原市委的无产阶级革命派，经常废寝忘食，通宵达旦地连续战斗。他们睡不上觉，吃不上饭，但时时刻刻都没有忘记学习毛主席著作。他们信心百倍地说：“饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，毛主席著作不能不学。”
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、排长李凤鸣说：“不比不知道，一比开了窍。过去，只认为自己学习毛主席著作还可以，受过表扬；和无产阶级革命派的同志一比，就觉得差距很大。”他说，他们守卫的山西省人民银行，有一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的忠实走卒。当革命群众写大字报揭露这伙人的罪恶时，他们便施展法西斯手段，压制、威胁革命群众，妄想扑灭革命烈火。在斗争艰苦的时候，革命群众就学习毛主席语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”斗志倍增，愈战愈勇，越战越强，粉碎了走资本主义道路当权派的一次又一次反扑。他们说：“毛主席和我们在一起，我们什么也不怕，什么困难都能克服，什么敌人都能战胜。”
    座谈会上，指战员们纷纷表示，一定要象无产阶级革命派那样，无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，一心一意做毛主席的好战士。
      只有和无产阶级革命派战斗
  在一起，才能把他们的革命精神
  真正学到手
    怎样才能把无产阶级革命派的革命精神学到手？这个连的指战员在座谈中说，毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”只有坚决遵循毛主席的教导，投入到火热的革命斗争中去，坚决地，全心全意地，毫不含糊地支持和援助无产阶级革命派的联合夺权斗争，和无产阶级革命派同呼吸、共命运，想无产阶级革命派之想，急无产阶级革命派之急，以无产阶级革命派之任为己任，才能很好地向无产阶级革命派学习，真正把他们的革命精神学到手。
    战士孟德明说：和无产阶级革命派共同战斗中，无产阶级革命派把毛泽东思想当作第一生命，不怕苦、不怕累，英勇顽强，不屈不挠的革命精神，每时每刻教育着我。在一次执行支持无产阶级革命派的紧急任务时，我们全班急速跑步前进，我两腿因患关节炎，跑了一段路就痛起来，在无产阶级革命派革命精神的鼓舞下，我边跑边念毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”坚持跑到目的地，完成任务回来后，双腿发肿，疼痛得厉害，但我想到和革命群众一起战斗，政治思想上得来很大收获时，满心高兴，关节的疼痛也全忘了。
    指战员们说，在夺权斗争中，我们始终和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，亲眼看到无产阶级革命派学习毛主席著作的热情很高，劲头很大。他们运用毛主席的阶级分析观点观察形势，分析情况，作出正确的判断，指导自己的革命行动。在无产阶级革命派这种革命精神的鼓舞下，我们立即以实际行动来向他们学习。尽管我们人员少，任务重，但我们坚持抽出时间，到群众中去宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策，揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。结果，无产阶级革命派的队伍越战越强，受蒙蔽的群众很快觉醒，回到以毛主席为代表的正确路线上来，极大地孤立和打击了一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在和无产阶级革命派共同战斗的日子里，我们更加体会到伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力，向无产阶级革命派学习的决心更大，自觉性更高了。
