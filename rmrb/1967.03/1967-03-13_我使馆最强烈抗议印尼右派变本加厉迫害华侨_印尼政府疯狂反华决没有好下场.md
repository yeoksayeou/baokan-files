Our Embassy Strongly Protests Indonesian Rightists' Intensified Persecution of Overseas Chinese
Indonesian Government's Mad Anti-China Policy Will Meet a Bad End

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, news from Jakarta: On the 10th, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, strongly protesting the unprecedented scale of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities stirred up by the rightist authorities in East Java since the issuance of four anti-China and anti-Chinese "decrees" by the commander of the Eighth Military Region, Sumitro, in December 1966.

	The note specifically pointed out that on January 15 of this year, the Chinese Embassy had already sent a note to the Indonesian government regarding this serious incident, expressing the strongest protest and making serious demands. However, the Indonesian government has not only failed to respond to this, has not stopped the aforementioned anti-Chinese criminal activities, but has instead intensified the implementation of the four reactionary decrees, ordering Chinese merchants to cease operations. The reactionary authorities in Malang, Kediri, and other places have even incited a group of bureaucrats, military personnel, and thugs to lead armed police and soldiers to openly seize Chinese-owned shops, intimidate, beat people at will, and illegally arrest innocent overseas Chinese. At the same time, the local authorities in East Java have used various threats and intimidation tactics to extort and blackmail, forcing overseas Chinese to pay so-called "special obligation donations" within a deadline. The local authorities in East Java have also openly banned overseas Chinese from using the Chinese language and script, confiscated letters between overseas Chinese and their homeland, and attempted to sever the connection between overseas Chinese and their homeland.

	The note said that under the brutal persecution of the reactionary authorities in East Java, in just two months, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese have been driven to desperation, their livelihoods destroyed, some families separated, and some families ruined. Overseas Chinese such as Shi Changlun and He Zixiu were among those who were driven to death. The embassy expressed deep indignation at the inhuman and shocking anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities committed by the Indonesian government and strongly protested to the Indonesian government.

	The note said that the Indonesian government has repeatedly wantonly trampled on the basic principles of international relations, arbitrarily violated treaties and agreements between the two governments regarding the issue of overseas Chinese, and ignored the repeated serious protests of the Chinese government, acting arbitrarily and issuing various decrees. It has carried out inhuman persecution against overseas Chinese who have lived in Indonesia for generations, have traditional friendships with the local people, and have made beneficial contributions to Indonesia's social and economic life, and has plundered their property like bandits, causing a great disaster for the vast number of innocent overseas Chinese.

	The note said that the era when the Chinese people and overseas Chinese could be manipulated and slaughtered at will has long passed. The Chinese people and overseas Chinese of the Mao Zedong era are absolutely not to be insulted. Overseas Chinese armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are fearless of violence and dare to fight. Your evil deeds are extremely unpopular. They not only face the resolute resistance of overseas Chinese but also receive the just condemnation of the Indonesian people and the people of the world. The new and old debts you owe to the Chinese people and overseas Chinese will eventually have to be repaid, and the accounts will have to be settled thoroughly. The friendship between the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese can withstand the test of time, but your fate can only be "lifting a stone to drop on your own feet," "starting with the intention to harm others and ending with harming yourself." You will absolutely not escape the punishment of history.

	The note finally urgently demanded that the Indonesian government: immediately revoke the four anti-Chinese decrees in East Java, stop all persecution of overseas Chinese; release the detained overseas Chinese; compensate for all the losses of overseas Chinese.

    我使馆最强烈抗议印尼右派变本加厉迫害华侨
    印尼政府疯狂反华决没有好下场
    据新华社十二日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十日照会印尼外交部，就印尼第八军区司令苏米特洛一九六六年十二月发布四项反华、排华的“决定书”以来，东爪哇右派当局掀起的一个空前规模的反华、排华浪潮，向印尼政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会特别指出，今年一月十五日，中国大使馆曾就这一严重事件照会印尼政府，提出了最强烈的抗议和严正的要求。但是，印尼政府至今不仅未作任何答复，未停止上述排华的罪恶活动，反而变本加厉地推行四项反动法令，勒令华商停止营业。玛琅、谏义里等地的反动当局，甚至唆使一伙官僚、军人和恶棍，率领武装军警，明目张胆地强占华商店面，百般恫吓，任意打人，并非法逮捕无辜华侨。与此同时，东爪哇地方当局还采用各种威胁恐吓手段，大肆敲诈勒索，逼迫华侨在限期内缴纳所谓“特别义务捐”。东爪哇地方当局，还公然禁止华侨使用中国语言和文字，没收华侨与祖国来往的信件，妄图隔绝华侨与祖国的联系。
    照会说，在东爪哇反动当局的残酷迫害下，短短两个月内，数以万计的华侨被逼得走投无路，生计断绝，有的妻离子散，家破人亡。华侨石昌仑、何子修等七人，就是活活被逼死的。大使馆对印尼政府惨无人道、骇人听闻的反华、排华暴行，表示难以抑制的愤慨，并向印尼政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说，印尼政府一再恣意践踏起码的国际关系准则，蛮横地破坏两国政府间有关侨民问题的条约和协定，并无视中国政府多次的严正抗议，一意孤行，滥发各种法令，对世世代代居住在印尼、同当地人民有着传统友谊并对印尼社会经济生活起了有益作用的华侨，实行种种惨无人道的迫害，盗匪般地掠夺他们的财产，使广大无辜华侨遭受到一场大灾难。
    照会说，中国人民和华侨，任人摆布、任人宰割的时代早已一去不复返了。毛泽东时代的中国人民和华侨，是绝对不容侮辱的。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的华侨，是不畏强暴、敢于斗争的中华儿女。你们的罪恶行径，是极其不得人心的。它不仅遭到华侨的坚决反抗，而且也受到了印尼人民和世界人民的正义谴责。你们对中国人民和华侨所欠下的新债旧债，终究是要偿还的，是非彻底算清不可的。印尼人民和华侨的友谊是经得起时间考验的，而你们的下场，只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，“以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终”，你们绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚。
    照会最后紧急地要求印尼政府：必须立即撤销东爪哇的四项排华法令，停止对华侨的一切迫害；释放被逮捕的华侨；赔偿华侨的一切损失。
