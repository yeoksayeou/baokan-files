U.S. warships and aircraft have continuously invaded our territorial waters and airspace. We issue a severe warning. Our people are extremely indignant at the U.S. imperialist military provocations. The great Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. We have made all preparations. If you dare to persist and continue to cause trouble, you will surely be severely punished.

	Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: At 14:30 to 22:24 on March 20th, one U.S. warship invaded our territorial waters off the eastern region of Huangqi Peninsula, Fujian Province. From 06:26 to 10:00 on March 21st, one U.S. warship invaded our territorial waters off the eastern region of Zhenhai to Dongshan Island, Fujian Province. On the same day, from 14:43 to 16:23, three batches of three U.S. military aircraft invaded the airspace above the western region of Changhua, Hainan Island, Guangdong Province. Regarding the military provocations by U.S. warships and military aircraft, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, on behalf of the Ministry, issued the 429th severe warning.

	Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: Our reporter reports: One U.S. imperialist warship invaded our territorial waters off the eastern region of Huangqi Peninsula, Fujian Province, yesterday and today. Three batches of three U.S. military aircraft invaded the airspace above the western region of Changhua, Hainan Island, today. This is a new and serious military provocation by the Johnson administration against the Chinese people at a time when it is escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam and intensifying military adventurism in Southeast Asia, which has aroused the extreme indignation of the people of the entire country. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, on behalf of the Ministry, issued the 429th severe warning.

	The U.S. warship that invaded our territorial waters is the flagship of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, the "Providence" cruiser. It is known that the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet is an important force serving the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war. It has directly participated in the war of aggression against Vietnam, massacring the Vietnamese people. In 1950, while participating in the war of aggression against Korea, this fleet also entered the Taiwan Strait, occupying our Taiwan Province, and has been continuously provoking us militarily for more than a decade. It has also been continuously shelling and bombing our fishing boats in the Gulf of Tonkin, owing a blood debt to the Chinese people.

	In the war of aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists have suffered repeated military failures, and their "peace talks" deception has been exposed one after another. The Johnson administration is in a state of desperation and is making a last-ditch struggle. In the past two days, Johnson and his group of military and political leaders have been holding a war conference on Guam, intensifying their plans to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and military adventurism in Southeast Asia. Recently, U.S. aggressors have also been active in making Taiwan and Hong Kong their bases for expanding the war of aggression. The Johnson administration sent U.S. Pacific Command Commander Sharp, Seventh Fleet Commander Hayler, and U.N. Representative Goldberg to Taiwan for secret "talks" with the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek and the military and political leaders of the Chiang bandits. U.S. warships frequently enter and exit Hong Kong, carrying out a series of war activities. Under these circumstances, the U.S. imperialist "Providence" cruiser and military aircraft have invaded our territorial waters and airspace to carry out military provocations. This is certainly not an accidental event.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "U.S. imperialism creates tension everywhere in the world to achieve its purpose of aggression and enslavement of the peoples of various countries. U.S. imperialism thinks that tension is always to its advantage, but the fact is that the tensions created by the United States have turned against its wishes. They have served to mobilize the peoples of the world to rise up against the U.S. aggressors." The banditry of U.S. imperialist warships and aircraft invading our territorial waters and airspace has aroused the strong indignation of our people. We sternly warn the U.S. government: It must immediately stop the military provocations. The great Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. We have made all preparations. If you dare to persist and continue to provoke and cause trouble, you will surely be severely punished.

    美国强盗军舰、飞机连续侵入我领海领空我提出严重警告
    我国人民对美帝军事挑衅表示极大愤怒
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大中国人民是不好惹的，我们已经作好一切准备，你们胆敢一意孤行，继续捣乱必将受到严厉惩罚。
    新华社二十一日讯　三月二十日十四时三十分至二十二时二十四分，美国军舰一艘，侵入我福建省黄岐半岛以东地区领海。三月二十一日六时二十六分至十时，美国军舰一艘侵入我福建省镇海至东山岛以东地区领海。同日十四时四十三分至十六时二十三分，美国军用飞机三批三架，侵入我广东省海南岛昌化以西地区领海上空。对于美国军舰和军用飞机的这种军事挑衅，我外交部发言人奉命提出第四百二十九次严重警告。
    新华社二十一日讯　本社记者报道：美帝国主义军舰一艘，昨天和今天连续侵入我福建省黄岐半岛以东、镇海至东山岛以东地区领海，军用飞机三批三架今天侵入我海南岛昌化以西地区领海上空。这是约翰逊政府在大搞侵略越南战争“升级”，在东南亚加紧策划军事冒险活动的时候，对中国人民进行的新的严重的军事挑衅，激起我全国人民的极大愤怒。我外交部发言人奉命提出第四百二十九次严重警告。
    侵入我领海的这艘美国强盗军舰是第七舰队旗舰“普罗维顿斯号”巡洋舰。人们知道，美国海军第七舰队，是为美帝国主义推行侵略和战争政策服务的一支重要力量。它直接参加了侵略越南的战争，屠杀越南人民。一九五○年，这支舰队在参加侵略朝鲜战争的同时，进驻台湾海峡，霸占了我国领土台湾省，十多年来不断向我进行军事挑衅。它还在北部湾不断炮击、轰炸我国渔船，对中国人民欠下了累累血债。
    美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中，军事行动不断遭到失败，“和谈”骗局又接二连三地破产，约翰逊政府狗急跳墙，正在作垂死挣扎。这两天，约翰逊带领的一帮军政头目，正在关岛召开杀气腾腾的战争会议，加紧策划扩大侵略越南的战争和在东南亚的军事冒险。最近，美国侵略者还在加紧活动，把台湾、香港作为它扩大侵略战争的活动基地。约翰逊政府派出美军驻太平洋地区总司令夏普、第七舰队司令海兰、驻联合国大使戈德堡等到台湾，同匪首蒋介石和蒋匪帮军政头目秘密“会谈”。美国侵略舰只频繁进出香港，进行一系列的战争活动。美帝国主义“普罗维顿斯号”巡洋舰和军用飞机在这种情况下，侵入我国领海领空进行军事挑衅，这绝不是一个偶然事件。
    毛主席教导我们：“美帝国主义在全世界到处制造紧张局势，以期达到它侵略和奴役各国人民的目的。美帝国主义自以为紧张局势总是对它自己有利，但是事实是，美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”美帝国主义军舰、飞机侵入我领海领空的强盗行径，激起了我国人民的强烈愤怒。我们严正警告美国政府：必须立即停止军事挑衅。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大中国人民是不好惹的，我们已经作好一切准备，你们胆敢一意孤行，继续挑衅捣乱必将受到严厉惩罚。
