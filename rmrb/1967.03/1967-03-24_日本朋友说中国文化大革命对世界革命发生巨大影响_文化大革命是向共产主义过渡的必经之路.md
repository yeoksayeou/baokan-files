Japanese renowned progressive writer Jiangma Xiu and his wife Toyoda Shizuko, who recently returned from a visit to China, expressed their boundless love for Chairman Mao in a conversation with Chinese journalists, highly praising the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

Jiangma said, Mao Zedong is the greatest leader of our time, and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in our time.

Jiangma said, Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively developed the theory of proletarian revolution. Chairman Mao's works embody the unshakable principles of the proletarian revolution and are full of boundless vitality. Chairman Mao's works have made Marxism-Leninism shine with new brilliance.

Jiangma Xiu highly evaluated the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, saying, Chairman Mao has summed up the experience of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement, launching a cultural revolution aimed at preventing the emergence of revisionism. This cultural revolution is a necessary step for socialist countries where the proletariat has seized power to transition to communism. This great revolution will have a huge impact on the world revolution. Both Jiangma and Toyoda emphasized that only Chairman Mao can lead such an unprecedented cultural revolution. Jiangma and Toyoda also enthusiastically praised the new changes in the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Jiangma said, they saw everywhere in China the revolutionary fervor of the Chinese people studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, deeply feeling that Mao Zedong Thought has been grasped by the broad masses of the people.

Toyoda Shizuko said, she saw in China that the Chinese people are striving to "break with the self and establish the public" according to Mao Zedong Thought, making themselves into new people of communism. She said, this is unprecedented in the world, and it ensures that China will never change color.

Jiangma and Toyoda enthusiastically praised the revolutionary young workers, students, and Red Guards they saw in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Jiangma Xiu said, from their ardent revolutionary spirit of dedicating themselves to the revolution, they are indeed the new generation nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought and the most reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.
