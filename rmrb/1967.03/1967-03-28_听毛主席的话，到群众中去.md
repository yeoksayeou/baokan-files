These days, in the Liujia Brigade of Dawei People's Commune in Jin County, Liaoning Province, the propaganda team of the Sixth Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, led by Captain Yang Zhaoxing, discovered that the brigade's Party branch secretary, Chen Xingde, spoke very little during meetings and did not work boldly. Upon inquiry, Chen Xingde told him, "Old Yang, to be honest, I'm afraid that if I speak, no one will listen, and if I do something, no one will help!" Chen Xingde is a representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Liaoning Province. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the commune members have raised some criticisms of him and posted some big-character posters, but they still believe in him and hope he will boldly come forward to seize the revolution and promote production. After Yang Zhaoxing arrived, he enthusiastically helped him study Chairman Mao's works, and Chen Xingde also expressed his determination to come forward and actively seize the revolution and promote production. However, why does Chen Xingde still have reservations? What is the opinion of the poor and lower-middle peasants towards him? Yang Zhaoxing went among the poor and lower-middle peasants and learned that Chen Xingde's mental reservations were due to listening to some people's reflections, fearing that the masses would not believe in him.

One evening, Yang Zhaoxing came to Chen Xingde's home, sat on the kang (a traditional heated bed), and had an intimate talk. Yang Zhaoxing said, "Old Chen, in our company, I remember once during a democratic meeting, the soldiers gave me a lot of criticisms. At first, I was also worried that I would not be able to speak effectively in the future. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works and going among the people, I humbly made a self-criticism to everyone, and the problem was solved." Chen Xingde listened and eagerly asked, "Which works did you study?" Yang Zhaoxing opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read, "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles." "Because we serve the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not be afraid of others pointing them out and criticizing us." Chen Xingde listened to Chairman Mao's teachings and suddenly felt his face flush. He then said to Yang Zhaoxing, "In the past, I really forgot Chairman Mao's teachings, made mistakes, not only did I not make a self-criticism to the people, but I also worried that the people would not believe in me. I was wrong."

Chen Xingde went from door to door to the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, seeking their opinions, and visited eleven households in three days. These eleven households of poor and lower-middle peasants had either begged for food or herded sheep with Chen Xingde, or had fought against landlords and divided land with him. Chen Xingde came to the home of old poor peasant Sun Guojing. Old Grandpa Sun said, "Xingde, we poor and lower-middle peasants criticize you, not to criticize you down, but to criticize you to have a sturdier backbone, to do better for us poor brothers." These words made Chen Xingde's heart warm and his eyes fill with tears. He thought: The old poor peasants treat me like their own son, but I have not treated them as my own parents. He saw Yang Zhaoxing excitedly and said, "Old Yang, going among the people makes my heart so clear!"

Another evening, Yang Zhaoxing came to Chen Xingde's home. These two, who were both orphans begging for food in the old society, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, reminisced about the bitterness of the old society and talked about the sweetness of today. Yang Zhaoxing said, "Old Chen, we are both people saved by Chairman Mao, so we must do the work entrusted to us by Chairman Mao well!" Chen Xingde said, "I did not do the work well in the past, and I am sorry to the Party and to Chairman Mao. Old Yang, help me find out where the root of the problem is." Yang Zhaoxing mentioned a matter of digging a well to him.

In the spring of the previous year, the brigade planned to dig a well that could irrigate five hundred mu of dry land. The representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants held a meeting and, according to the spirit of thrift in running the commune, formulated a plan that was fast, economical, and good. When the well was dug to more than ten meters deep, Chen Xingde listened to the erroneous opinions of a few people and decided on his own to change the original plan. As a result, the well, which was started in the spring, was not completed until the autumn, wasting more than five hundred man-days and one hundred and fifty cubic meters of stone. Yang Zhaoxing said, "This is a serious lesson! Old Chen, let's see how Chairman Mao teaches us!" Saying this, he took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read, "Our Party has been doing mass work every day for more than twenty years, and for nearly ten years, we have been talking about the mass line. We have always advocated that the revolution depends on the masses, everyone should participate, and we oppose relying on a few people to issue orders. However, in the work of some comrades, the mass line is still not implemented, and they still rely on a few people to do the work coldly and quietly." Chairman Mao's teachings made Chen Xingde's heart suddenly clear, and he felt that Chairman Mao's words opened his mind. He said, "Old Yang, Chairman Mao is criticizing me. It's not that no one listens to me when I speak, but that I don't listen to the people. It's not that no one helps me when I do something, but that I don't help the people do things well. The mistake lies in not acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions." Yang Zhaoxing said, "Whether to believe in the masses, whether to follow the mass line, this is a major issue of whether to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Chen Xingde said with full confidence, "Old Yang, I must make up for this lesson!"

The inspection of spring plowing preparations began. One day, Chen Xingde found that the livestock of the production team were not fattening, and poor livestock condition would delay spring plowing. Yang Zhaoxing and he studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We should go among the people, learn from the people, summarize their experiences, and turn them into better, more systematic theories and methods, and then tell the people (propagate) and call on the people to implement them, solve the people's problems, and liberate and bring happiness to the people." Chairman Mao's teachings were like timely rain, and the words made Chen Xingde's heart bright and his eyes clear. He immediately went to the eighth production team to invite old farmers and livestock keepers to hold a meeting in the livestock pen. Everyone spoke one after another, and quickly found the reasons for the poor livestock condition. Then, everyone made plans to address these problems. Chen Xingde listened and was deeply moved. He silently recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often naive and laughable. Not understanding this, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." After taking measures, the poor livestock condition in the entire brigade was quickly reversed. The commune members said, "Chen Xingde has become smarter, his words are more reasonable, and his ideas are more numerous." Chen Xingde said, "Only the people's brains are the smartest, their words are the most reasonable, and their ideas are the most effective. Not following the mass line is terrible, following the mass line is wonderful. I will listen to Chairman Mao's words and the words of the poor and lower-middle peasants for a lifetime, and forever be a student of Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants."

### 听毛主席的话，到群众中去

    听毛主席的话，到群众中去
    这几天，在辽宁省金县大魏公社刘家大队宣传毛泽东思想的解放军某团六连连长杨兆兴，发现大队党支部书记陈兴德开会时很少讲话，工作也不大胆。一了解，陈兴德对他说：“老杨，说心里话，我是怕说话没人听，做事没人帮呀！”陈兴德是辽宁省贫下中农代表，无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，社员们对他提过一些意见，贴过一些大字报，但还是相信他，希望他能大胆地站出来，抓革命、促生产。杨兆兴到这里以后，热情地帮助他学习毛主席著作，他也表示决心要站出来，积极抓革命、促生产。可是，陈兴德为什么还有顾虑呢？贫下中农对他的看法又是怎样呢？杨兆兴深入贫下中农，了解到陈兴德的思想顾虑，是他听了一些人的反映，怕群众不相信自己。
    晚上，杨兆兴来到陈兴德家里，坐在炕头，促膝谈心。杨兆兴说：“老陈，我在连队里，记得一次民主大会战士们给我提了不少意见，开始我也耽心今后说话不灵了，后来学习了毛主席著作，又走到群众中去，虚心向大家作了检讨，问题就解决了。”陈兴德听了，忙问：“是学的哪些著作？”杨兆兴翻开《毛主席语录》念着：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”陈兴德听了毛主席的教导，顿时脸上觉得有点发烧，便对杨兆兴说：“以往我确实忘记了毛主席这些教导，犯了错误，不仅不向群众作检讨，还耽心群众不相信自己，是我错了。”
    陈兴德挨门逐户来到贫下中农家里，征求意见，三天之内走了十一家。这十一家贫下中农，有的和陈兴德在一起讨过饭，放过羊，有的和陈兴德曾在一起斗地主、分田地。陈兴德来到老贫农孙国景家，孙老大爷说：“兴德，俺贫下中农批评你，不是要把你批评倒，而是要把你批评得腰杆子更硬实，为俺穷哥们更好地办事。”这番话说得陈兴德心里热乎乎的，热泪满眶，好久说不出话来。他想：老贫农待我象亲生儿子，我却没把他们当作亲生父母。他见了杨兆兴激动地说：“老杨，走到群众中去，心里敞亮多啦！”
    又一个晚上，杨兆兴来到了陈兴德家里。这两个在旧社会都是家破人亡逃荒讨饭的孤儿，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，共忆旧社会苦，同谈今日甜。杨兆兴说：“老陈，咱们都是毛主席解救出来的人，可一定要把毛主席交给我们的工作做好啊！”陈兴德说：“我以往没把工作做好，对不起党，对不起毛主席，老杨，你帮我找找根子在哪儿？”杨兆兴向他提出了一桩打井的事。
    头年春上，大队计划打一眼能灌溉五百亩旱地的大井，贫协代表开了会，按照勤俭办社的精神，订了个又快又省又好的方案。井打到一丈多深，陈兴德听了个别人的错误意见，一个人便决定改变原来的方案。结果，井从春上打到秋后还未完工，浪费了五百多个工，一百五十立方石头。杨兆兴说：“这是个严重的教训呀！老陈，看看毛主席是怎样教导咱们的吧！”说着，便拿出《毛主席语录》读起来：“我党二十几年来，天天做群众工作，近十几年来，天天讲群众路线。我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。但是在有些同志的工作中间，群众路线仍然不能贯彻，他们还是只靠少数人冷冷清清地做工作。”毛主席的教导，使陈兴德心里豁然明亮，他感到毛主席的话句句打开了自己的心窍。他说：“老杨，毛主席批评的就是我。不是我说话没人听，是我没听群众的话，不是我做事没人帮，是我没帮群众办好事。千错万错就错在没按毛主席的指示办事。”杨兆兴说：“相不相信群众，走不走群众路线，这是执行不执行毛主席的革命路线的大节问题。”陈兴德充满信心地说：“老杨，我一定要补上这一课！”
    检查备耕工作开始了。一天，陈兴德发现生产队的牲口不上膘，膘情不好就会耽误春耕。杨兆兴便和他学习毛主席的教导：“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来，成为更好的有条理的道理和办法，然后再告诉群众（宣传），并号召群众实行起来，解决群众的问题，使群众得到解放和幸福。”毛主席的教导象及时雨，句句话说得陈兴德心明眼亮。他马上到第八生产队请老农、饲养员在牲口圈开了会。大伙你一言我一语，很快就找到了膘情不好的原因。接着，大家又针对这些问题订出了措施。陈兴德听了心里十分感动，默默地背诵着毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”采取措施后，全大队牲口膘情不好的情况很快扭转过来了。社员们说：“陈兴德脑子聪明了，说话中听了，主意也多了。”陈兴德说：“只有群众的脑子最聪明，说话最中听，主意最管用。不走群众路线不得了，走了群众路线了不得。我要听一辈子毛主席的话，听一辈子贫下中农的话，永远做毛主席和贫下中农的小学生。”
