In the wake of the Johnson administration's convening of the Guam conference and its issuance of new directives to escalate the war in Vietnam, U. Thant, who has long been a faithful servant of U.S. policy in Vietnam, engaged in backroom dealings with the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists. On March 28, he unveiled a memorandum he had sent to relevant parties on March 14, concocting a new grand deception and conspiracy to supposedly resolve the Vietnam War.

U. Thant proposed his "three-step plan" to resolve the Vietnam War a week before the Guam conference and released it a week after the conference, at a time when the U.S. was madly escalating the war. This shows that his new trick is entirely aimed at adapting to the U.S. imperialists' policy of intensifying the "war to force surrender," using the smoke screen of "peace talks" to cover up the U.S.'s mad war escalation.

A Pure U.S. Product

The content of U. Thant's three-point proposal is as follows:

"Implement a complete ceasefire; hold preliminary talks; reconvene the Geneva Conference." U. Thant, in his capacity as the UN Secretary-General, under the banner of "seeking peace," poses as a "mediator." In reality, he is acting as a faithful henchman of U.S. imperialist policy in Vietnam.

U. Thant's three-point proposal is a pure U.S. product. The U.S. imperialists have been clamoring that if they are to stop bombing North Vietnam, the other side must also take "reciprocal actions," that is, implement so-called "gradual de-escalation" of the war. U. Thant, following the logic of the U.S. bandits, without distinguishing between the aggressor and the victim, vigorously advocates for "implementing a complete ceasefire." The "gradual de-escalation" in the mouth of the U.S. imperialists is merely a euphemism for the Vietnamese people to "gradually lay down their arms" and "gradually surrender." U. Thant, however, demands that the Vietnamese people surrender immediately and completely, reaching the pinnacle of treachery in his role as a tiger's accomplice. As for U. Thant's talk of "holding preliminary talks" and "convening the Geneva Conference," these are merely old tricks in the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" conspiracy, nothing new. Under the condition that the U.S. imperialists are occupying South Vietnam, any "talks" or "conferences" can only be a big deception serving the U.S. aggressors. Everyone knows that the Vietnam issue is unrelated to the United Nations, and the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue. U. Thant, in his capacity as the UN Secretary-General, advocates for convening the Geneva Conference to help the U.S. imperialists shift the blame for their complete violation of the Geneva Accords, which only shows that the U.S. aggressors and their accomplices and lackeys are racking their brains to help the U.S. imperialists get out of their predicament in Vietnam.

A Product of U.S.-Soviet Collusion

U. Thant's three-point proposal is entirely a product of U.S.-Soviet collusion, aimed at pressuring the Vietnamese people to "surrender" and "force surrender."

During the period when U. Thant was concocting his "three-point proposal," he had frequent contacts and talks with U.S. and Soviet representatives at the United Nations. Meanwhile, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin, during his visit to Britain, also vigorously advocated for the U.S. to stop bombing North Vietnam and to resolve the Vietnam issue on the basis of the Geneva Accords. It is reported that the Soviet government also discussed U. Thant's plan with British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Harold Harrison. Harrison told the Soviet government that British Foreign Secretary George Brown was prepared to "cooperate" with the Soviet Foreign Minister to make it "a reality."

Washington's Praise

As soon as U. Thant's memorandum was sent to relevant parties on March 14, it immediately received enthusiastic welcome from U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and servants.

After giving a brief affirmative response to U. Thant's memorandum on March 15, the U.S. government followed up with a detailed response on March 18, praising U. Thant's proposal as "containing constructive and positive elements for achieving a peaceful resolution to the Vietnam conflict." The U.S. stated that it was "ready to immediately participate in such discussions with a constructive attitude" and was "also ready to take subsequent steps in any form suggested by the Secretary-General."

U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk both made public statements on March 28, supporting and welcoming U. Thant's proposal.

Johnson even publicly stated that he "found it difficult to agree" with the Vietnamese people's repeated assertion that the Vietnam issue is unrelated to the United Nations and declared that the U.S. welcomes the United Nations' (efforts to resolve the Vietnam issue).

Rusk, at a press conference, praised U. Thant's current proposal, saying that compared to his "three-point plan" from last year, which served the U.S.'s "peace talks" deception, there was "a major difference," that is, "this plan indeed emphasizes mutual cessation of military actions as an important first step." U. Thant's plan from last year emphasized that the U.S. should stop bombing North Vietnam and gradually reduce military actions. This further exposed that U. Thant's new trick is entirely in line with the intentions of U.S. imperialism.

While lavishly praising U. Thant's memorandum, Rusk also blatantly issued a war threat to the Vietnamese people. He brazenly threatened that the U.S. would "fulfill its obligations" in "South Vietnam," and "fulfill its responsibilities." This means that the U.S. will continue its aggression in Vietnam, and U. Thant's proposal is precisely a major conspiracy to pressure the Vietnamese people to surrender in line with U.S. policy in Vietnam.

Cannot Save the U.S. Imperialists

At present, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, is madly escalating the war according to the directives of the Guam conference, and on the other hand, is colluding with its lackeys and servants to intensify the "peace talks" deception. This is entirely a sign of its desperate, dying struggle. In the face of the heroic Vietnamese people who are determined to fight to the end, the more it intensifies this counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy, the closer it comes to complete failure. This is an objective law that Soviet revisionists and UN Secretary-General U. Thant and the like cannot change no matter how much they help.

### 配合美帝侵越政策　诱迫越南人民投降  吴丹玩新花招搞旧阴谋  抛出一个所谓“三个步骤”方案马上得到约翰逊喝采

    配合美帝侵越政策　诱迫越南人民投降
    吴丹玩新花招搞旧阴谋
    抛出一个所谓“三个步骤”方案马上得到约翰逊喝采
    新华社三十日讯　纽约消息：在约翰逊政府召开关岛黑会，作出了扩大侵越战争的新部署之后，一直为美国侵越政策奔走效劳的联合国秘书长吴丹，经过同美帝和苏修的幕后活动，二十八日抛出了他在三月十四日写给有关方面的一项备忘录，处心积虑地制造了一个所谓解决越南战争问题的新的大骗局、大阴谋。
    吴丹在关岛黑会前一周向有关各方提出他的解决越南战争问题的“三个步骤”方案，而在关岛黑会过后一周，美国正在疯狂进行战争“升级”的时候予以公布，这说明了他玩弄的这番新花招完全是为了适应美帝国主义加紧推行“以战迫降”政策的需要，以“和谈”烟幕为美国正在疯狂战争“升级”的行径打掩护。
    地地道道美国货
    吴丹的三点建议的内容是：
  “实行全面停下来的休战；举行初步会谈；重开日内瓦会议。”吴丹以联合国秘书长的身份，打着
  “争取和平”的旗号，摆出一副“和事佬”的姿态，实际上所干的，完全是充当美帝国主义侵越政策的忠实走卒的勾当。
    吴丹的三点建议是地地道道的美国货。美帝国主义叫嚷，如果要它停止对越南北方的狂轰滥炸，就必须对方也采取“对等行动”，即实行所谓战争的“逐步降级”，而吴丹按照美国的强盗逻辑，不分侵略者和被侵略者，大肆鼓吹要“实行全面停下来的休战”。美帝国主义嘴里的“逐步降级”，不过是要越南人民“逐步放下武器”、“逐步投降”的同义语，而吴丹则要求越南人民立即全面投降，其为虎作伥，用心之歹毒，可算达到登峰造极的程度了。至于吴丹所说的什么“举行初步会谈”，“召开日内瓦会议”，则都是美帝国主义者“和谈”阴谋中的破烂货，不是什么新鲜玩艺。在美帝国主义霸占越南南方的情况下，什么“会谈”、“会议”都只能是为美国侵略者效劳的大骗局。谁都知道，越南问题同联合国无关，联合国无权干预越南问题。吴丹以联合国秘书长的身份，鼓吹召开日内瓦会议来为美帝国主义推卸它彻底撕毁日内瓦协议的罪责，只能说明美国侵略者及其帮凶、帮闲之流，为使美帝国主义摆脱侵越困境，心劳日拙。
      美苏合谋的产物
    吴丹的三点建议，完全是美、苏合谋，对越南人民推行的“压降”、“迫降”政策的产物，是同它们的这种政策密切配合并为这一政策服务的。
    吴丹在炮制他的这个“三点建议”期间，在联合国同美、苏代表进行了频繁的接触和会谈。与此同时，苏联部长会议主席柯西金在访问英国时，也大力鼓吹美国对越南北方实行“停炸”和在日内瓦协议的基础上来解决越南问题。据报道，苏联政府还同英国驻苏大使哈里逊讨论了吴丹的方案，哈里逊告诉苏联政府，英国外交大臣布朗准备和苏联外交部长进行“合作”使之“可能成为现实”。
    华盛顿连声称赞
    吴丹的备忘录三月十四日向有关各方一发出，就立即得到美帝国主义及其走狗、仆从的热烈欢迎。
    美国政府在十五日对吴丹的备忘录作了简短的肯定答复之后，接着又在十八日作出详尽的答复，称赞吴丹的建议“包含对实现越南冲突的和平解决的建设性和积极的因素”，“美国准备马上抱着建设性的态度参加这种讨论”，并且“还准备按照秘书长所建议的任何形式采取后继的步骤”。
    美国总统约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克二十八日也发表公开谈话，支持和欢迎吴丹的建议。
    约翰逊甚至公然扬言，他“很难同意”越南人民所一再声明的越南问题同联合国无关的立场，并且声称美国欢迎联合国（为解决越南问题而作）的努力。
    腊斯克在记者招待会上称赞吴丹现在的建议同他去年提出的为美国“和谈”骗局效劳的“三点方案”相比，有“一个重大的不同点”，就是“这个方案的确强调双方相互停止军事行动作为重要的第一步”，吴丹去年的方案强调，美国停止对越南北方的轰炸，相互把军事行动“逐步降级”等。这就更加暴露了吴丹的新花招是完全适应美帝国主义的意旨的。
    腊斯克在大肆赞扬吴丹备忘录的同时，又露骨地向越南人民发出战争讹诈。他悍然威胁说，美国将在“南越履行我们的义务”，“履行我们的职责”。这就等于说，美国要对越南侵略到底，而吴丹的建议正是配合美国的侵越政策，诱压越南人民投降的一个大阴谋。
    救不了美帝的命
    目前，美帝国主义一面按照关岛黑会的部署，疯狂扩大战争，一面伙同它的帮凶走卒，加紧推行“和谈”骗局，这完全是它穷途末路、垂死挣扎的表现。在决心抗战到底的英雄的越南人民面前，它越是加紧推行这套反革命两手策略，就越接近彻底的失败，这是苏联修正主义者和联合国秘书长吴丹之流怎样帮忙也改变不了的客观规律。
