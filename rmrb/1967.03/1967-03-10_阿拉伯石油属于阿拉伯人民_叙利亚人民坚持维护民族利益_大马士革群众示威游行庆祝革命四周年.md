Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Zain, said at a press conference held on March 4 that the victory of the Syrian people in their struggle against the "Iraq Petroleum Company" is not the final victory. The Syrian people will continue to fight in all fields to achieve all their rights.

In order to resist the economic plunder of imperialism and safeguard national interests, the Syrian people have recently waged a struggle against the "Iraq Petroleum Company," controlled by Western monopoly capital, and forced this foreign oil company to accept the Syrian government's reasonable demand to increase the transit tax on foreign oil.

Zain said at the press conference that the Arab people are the masters of Arab oil. The Arab people will continue to fight to take back their wealth from the imperialist monopolists and manage it themselves.

He said that in the past, some people thought that the oil monopoly companies were untouchable because they could use money to overthrow a government. However, the struggle of the Syrian people against the oil companies has shown that once the people have the resolve and are prepared to make sacrifices, they will achieve victory. Whoever persists in the struggle will achieve victory. He said that the struggle of the Arab people against colonialism and imperialism has the support of the people of the whole world.

According to the New China News Agency, Damascus, March 8, the President of the Arab Syrian Republic, Nureddin al-Atassi, in his speech on the fourth anniversary of the Syrian Revolution on March 8, condemned the savage crimes of U.S. imperialism in destroying villages and slaughtering peaceful residents in South Vietnam.

Al-Atassi said that U.S. imperialism has been surrounded by the Vietnamese people and will be thoroughly driven out of South Vietnam.

Al-Atassi also expressed support for the liberation struggle of the Palestinian people and criticized the U.S. and British imperialists for supplying weapons to their agents in Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

He stressed that no matter how powerful imperialism is in terms of material and technology, the people of all countries are invincible.

On the morning of March 8, Damascus held mass demonstrations and military parades to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Syrian Revolution.

    大马士革群众示威游行庆祝革命四周年
    新华社大马士革五日电　叙利亚总理扎因在四日举行的记者招待会上说，叙利亚人民同“伊拉克石油公司”进行斗争取得的胜利，并不是最后的胜利。叙利亚人民还将在各个领域内继续进行斗争，以实现一切权利。
    叙利亚人民为了反对帝国主义的经济掠夺，维护民族利益，最近，同西方垄断资本控制的“伊拉克石油公司”展开了斗争，迫使这家外国石油公司接受叙利亚政府提出的关于提高外国石油过境税的合理要求。
    扎因总理在记者招待会上说，阿拉伯人民是阿拉伯石油的主人。阿拉伯人民要继续进行斗争，把自己的财富从帝国主义垄断资本家手中夺回来自己管理。
    他说，过去，在某些人看来，石油垄断公司是不能碰的。因为他们可以拿钱去推翻一个政府。然而，叙利亚人民同石油公司的斗争表明，人民一旦有了决心，准备付出牺牲，就会取得胜利。谁能够坚持斗争，谁就能取得胜利。他说，阿拉伯人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义的斗争，得到全世界人民的支持。
    据新华社大马士革八日电　阿拉伯叙利亚共和国国家元首努尔丁·阿塔西在三月八日叙利亚革命四周年发表讲话，谴责美帝国主义在南越破坏村庄和屠杀和平居民的野蛮罪行。
    阿塔西说，美帝国主义已经被越南人民所包围，它将被彻底赶出南越。
    阿塔西还表示支持巴勒斯坦人民的解放斗争，并且指责美、英帝国主义者给他们在约旦和沙特阿拉伯的代理人输送武器。
    他强调说，不管帝国主义在物质和技术方面拥有多大的力量，各国人民是不可征服的。
    大马士革八日上午举行了群众示威游行和军事检阅，庆祝三月八日叙利亚革命四周年。
