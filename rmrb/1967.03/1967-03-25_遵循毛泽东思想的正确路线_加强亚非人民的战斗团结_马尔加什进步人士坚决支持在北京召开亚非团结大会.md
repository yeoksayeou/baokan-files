Tananarive, March 25 (New China News Agency) A progressive figure in Madagascar recently wrote a letter to Chinese friends, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao, saying: "Guiding us is the brightest red sun in our hearts, the beloved great leader Mao Zedong's thought." The letter also strongly condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership clique's collusion with U.S. imperialism to sabotage the unity of Asian and African peoples in their struggle against imperialism, and expresses firm support for the fifth Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing this year.

The letter says: "The Soviet revisionists and their lackeys are now openly colluding with U.S. imperialism here; even worse, these fellows are frantically attacking the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. Dear comrades and friends, we can no longer tolerate this. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful.' Therefore, at this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the People's Republic of China is bearing abundant fruits and exerting influence throughout the world, we enthusiastically acclaim the resolution to hold the fifth Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Conference in Beijing this year. I am happy to tell you that we firmly support the holding of this conference in Beijing."

This progressive figure continues in the letter: "I am convinced and very happy to tell you that this conference will make the distinction between good and bad clear, thereby strengthening the unity of the revolutionary forces against the Soviet revisionists, and thoroughly smashing the enemy with all means of struggle."

He further states: "We are not easily provoked. We want peace, but as long as the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs do not give up their unreasonable demands and plots to expand aggression, we must resolutely decide, together with the great Chinese people, to continue the struggle, because we are armed with the thought of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao, who is now the focus of the world's attention."

The letter reveals: "In Madagascar (formerly known as Malagasy), due to the presence of two Soviet journalists here, a small group of despicable, bought-out elements openly, like the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists, shamelessly dare to attack the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought in their newspapers with unbridled rumors."

This progressive figure enthusiastically says: "The time is ripe, and the opportunity must not be missed. The situation is excellent. Due to the rapid development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the fifth Asian-African Peoples' Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing will be a conference that follows the correct line of Mao Zedong Thought and decides the fate of the world revolution. Chairman Mao, with his class analysis of 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends?', first points out to us the basis for our success."

He emphasizes: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. 'The sun rises in the east, Chairman Mao is the greatest leader, the beacon lighting our path forward.'"

    遵循毛泽东思想的正确路线
    加强亚非人民的战斗团结
    马尔加什进步人士坚决支持在北京召开亚非团结大会
    新华社讯　塔那那利佛消息：马尔加什一位进步人士最近写信给中国朋友，热情颂扬毛主席说：“指引我们的是我们心中最红的太阳、敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东的思想。”信中还强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，大搞分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动的勾当，并且表示最坚决支持今年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    信中说：“苏修及其仆从现在在我们这里明目张胆地同美帝狼狈为奸；更恶劣的是，这些家伙拚命地对中华人民共和国的内部事务横加抨击。亲爱的同志们和朋友们，现在再也不能容忍了。毛主席教导我们说：‘凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。’因此，正当无产阶级文化大革命在中华人民共和国全国结出丰硕的果实，并在全世界产生影响的时刻，我们满怀最大的热情欢呼关于今年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议。我高兴地告诉你们，我们最坚决地支持在北京召开这次会议。”
    这位进步人士在信中接着说：“我确信并且要非常高兴地对你们说，这次会议将使得良莠分明，从而加强反对苏联修正主义者的革命派的团结，用所有的斗争手段彻底摧毁敌人。”
    他还说：“我们并不是轻易发怒的。我们是要和平的，但是，只要美帝国主义者及其走狗不放弃他们那种蛮横无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，我们就只有下定决心，同伟大的中国人民一起，继续战斗下去，因为我们是用现在全世界所瞩望的、当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的思想武装起来的。”
    这封来信揭露说：“在马达加斯加（按：马尔加什过去的名称），由于目前有两名苏联记者在这里，一小撮卑鄙的、被收买的家伙，公然同苏联修正主义者和美帝国主义者一样，无耻地胆敢在他们的报纸上，用肆无忌惮的谣言抨击毛泽东思想的伟大影响。”
    这位进步人士热情地说：“机不可失，时不再来。现在形势大好。由于中国的无产阶级文化大革命的迅猛发展，将在北京举行的第五届亚非人民团结大会，将是遵循毛泽东思想的正确路线、决定世界革命命运的一次会议。毛主席以他的‘谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？’的阶级分析，首先向我们指出了我们取得成功的基础。”
    他强调说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。”“日从东方出，毛主席是最伟大的领袖，是照亮我们前进道路的指路明灯。”
