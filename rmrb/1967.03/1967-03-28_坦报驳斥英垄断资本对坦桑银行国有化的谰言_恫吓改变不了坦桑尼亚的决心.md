Tanzanian Newspaper Refutes British Monopoly Capital's Slander on Nationalization of Banks
Threats Cannot Change Tanzania's Resolve

New China News Agency, Dar es Salaam. The Tanzanian newspaper *Uhuru* published an editorial on the 16th, refuting the slander of British monopoly capital against Tanzania's recent bank nationalization measures.

As previously reported, the Tanzanian government, in order to implement a policy of self-reliance, nationalized all foreign banks operating in Tanzania starting from February 6. This legitimate measure has been met with unreasonable opposition from British monopoly capital. According to reports, the chairman of the British bank Grindlays said at the beginning of this week that Tanzania's bank nationalization could leave it owing "millions" of pounds in debt, and further claimed that this action was "economically valueless."

In its editorial, *Uhuru* pointed out: "It is hard to believe that these banks, which are accustomed to speculation, express concern for the losses of their enterprises, but show sympathy for Tanzania's losses. They do not wail for the hundreds of millions of pounds they expected, but express regret for Tanzania's plight!"

The editorial further emphasized that as a developing country, we are in a position of strength. No threats from anywhere in the world can change this indisputable fact.

    坦报驳斥英垄断资本对坦桑银行国有化的谰言
    恫吓改变不了坦桑尼亚的决心
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》十六日发表社论，驳斥英国银行垄断资本对坦桑尼亚政府最近采取的银行国有化措施所发表的谰言。
    前已报道，坦桑尼亚政府为了实行自力更生政策，从二月六日起把设在坦桑尼亚的外国银行全部收归国有。这一正当措施遭到了英国垄断资本的无理反对。据报道，英国格林德莱银行的董事长在本星期初说什么坦桑尼亚实行银行国有化，可能使自己欠上“数百万”英镑之多的债，还胡说什么这个行动是“没有经济价值的”。
    《民族主义者报》在社论中指出：难以令人置信的是，投机成性的“这些银行不为它们的企业的损失难受，却表示为坦桑尼亚的损失难受。它们不为它们指望的成百万的金钱哀嚎，却表示为坦桑尼亚的困境感到遗憾！”
    社论还强调指出，我们作为一个发展中的国家，处在优势地位。世界上任何恫吓都不能改变这种无可争辩的情况。
