Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. The great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat is waging a struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and has achieved one victory after another.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces on the verge of extinction invariably struggle desperately against the revolutionary forces." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road (including those who were removed from their posts during the Four Clean-Ups Movement and insisted on taking the capitalist road) are desperately trying to reverse their failure by colluding with the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who persist in their reactionary stance. They are stirring up a black wind to overturn the Four Clean-Ups Movement in the countryside, factories, mines, and enterprises, and are attempting to overturn the great achievements of the Four Clean-Ups Movement. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses must smash this counter-revolutionary tide and resolutely defend the great achievements of the Four Clean-Ups Movement, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The Party Central Committee points out: "The Four Clean-Ups Movement has achieved great successes." This is a high evaluation of the Four Clean-Ups Movement and a resolute rebuff to the class enemies who are attempting to stage a counterattack and settle old scores.

The Four Clean-Ups Movement in socialist education in cities and countryside is proposed by our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and is a great socialist revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads.

The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Questions in the Current Rural Work" (the Ten Points) and the "Several Questions on the Current Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside" (the Twenty-Three Points) are both personally directed by Chairman Mao and are powerful ideological weapons for the Chinese people to carry out the socialist revolution. They are great Marxist-Leninist documents. In a short period in 1964, a "left" in form but right in essence line appeared within the Party. Chairman Mao personally led the struggle against this erroneous line. The Twenty-Three Points are the product of this struggle. Their emergence declared the bankruptcy of the "left" in form but right in essence line. The Twenty-Three Points formulated the correct guidelines and policies for the Four Clean-Ups Movement, ensuring that the movement advanced victoriously on the correct track.

Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the Four Clean-Ups Movement in many rural areas, factories, mines, and enterprises mobilized the broad masses, exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, removed them from their posts, and dealt a heavy blow to the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who persist in their reactionary stance. The socialist initiative of the masses has been greatly enhanced, and production has continued to increase. The socialist economy has been further consolidated and developed. Most importantly, the Four Clean-Ups Movement has launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promoting the thought revolution of the people. All these achievements cannot be erased by anyone. True proletarian revolutionaries all say, the Four Clean-Ups Movement is very good! The argument that "the Four Clean-Ups Movement has gone awry" is completely a malicious attack by the class enemies.

The class enemies shout, "Sending work teams for the Four Clean-Ups is wrong," and they incite some masses who do not understand the truth to drag back some ordinary work team members to struggle against them, forcing the work team members to reverse their cases. This is absolutely not allowed.

Sending work teams for the Four Clean-Ups, in accordance with the regulations of the Ten Points and the Twenty-Three Points, is correct. The issue is not the form of the work teams, but whether the work teams implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, whether they believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses, and whether they direct the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The vast majority of the Four Clean-Ups work team members, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, have lived, worked, and fought together with the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, establishing deep class feelings, and have made contributions to the Four Clean-Ups Movement. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society are plotting to create chaos by struggling against the Four Clean-Ups work team members, shifting the direction of the struggle. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses must smash the enemy's plots and tricks and must not be deceived.

Some people shout, "Overthrow all those in power."

Overthrowing all those in power is completely wrong. One must distinguish between proletarian power-holders and those who are taking the capitalist road. One must recognize that those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are only a handful. The so-called "overthrow all those in power" is deliberately confusing the distinction between proletarian power-holders and those who are taking the capitalist road, deliberately confusing the distinction between revolution and counter-revolution, with the purpose of overthrowing the proletarian power-holders, overthrowing the good and relatively good cadres who have grown up during the Four Clean-Ups Movement, destroying the great achievements of the Four Clean-Ups Movement, destroying the dictatorship of the proletariat, and destroying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This fallacy of "overthrowing all those in power" must be refuted.

The cadres at various levels in the rural people's communes, factories, mines, and enterprises are mostly good and relatively good. Especially in places where the Four Clean-Ups Movement has been successfully carried out, most of the cadres have firm stands, are active in their work, and take the lead in participating in labor. A handful of bad elements want to overthrow them, which is to counterattack the Four Clean-Ups Movement, strike at the masses, and plot to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. All revolutionary comrades should cherish and support the good and relatively good cadres who have grown up during the Four Clean-Ups Movement. For their various shortcomings and mistakes in their work, we should follow Chairman Mao's consistent teachings and adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity," criticize them, and help them correct their mistakes.

The focus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is the direction of the movement. In this intense and complex class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses must keep a clear head, not be deceived by the class enemies, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. We must not allow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society to stir up trouble, overturn the cases of the Four Clean-Ups. They must behave themselves and are not allowed to make trouble. If they dare to counterattack the Four Clean-Ups Movement and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must be immediately punished and the dictatorship of the proletariat must be firmly implemented.

The working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres must unite to smash any new counterattacks by the class enemies, respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," resolutely defend the great achievements of the Four Clean-Ups Movement, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    保卫四清运动的伟大成果
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    目前，无产阶级文化大革命，进入了一个新阶段。无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派（包括四清运动中下台的那些坚持走资本主义道路的），为了挽救自己的失败，勾结坚持反动立场的地富反坏右分子，疯狂地进行反扑。他们在农村、厂矿企业、事业单位，刮起一股翻四清案的黑风，妄图推翻四清运动的伟大成果。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，必须粉碎这股反革命逆流，坚决保卫四清运动的伟大成果，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    党中央指出：“四清运动有伟大的成绩。”这是对四清运动的崇高评价，也是对阶级敌人妄图反攻倒算的迎头痛击。
    城乡社会主义教育的四清运动，是我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席提出的，是在无产阶级专政的条件下，无产阶级同资产阶级的阶级斗争、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，是一场伟大的社会主义革命。
    《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》（即十条）和《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》（即二十三条），都是毛主席亲自主持制定的，是我国人民进行社会主义革命的强大思想武器，是伟大的马克思列宁主义文件。在一九六四年的一个短暂时间里，党内出现了形“左”实右的路线，毛主席亲自领导同这条错误路线进行了坚决的斗争。二十三条就是同这条错误路线斗争的产物。它的产生，宣布了形“左”实右路线的破产。二十三条制定了四清运动的正确方针和政策，保证了四清运动在正确的轨道上胜利前进。
    在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，许多农村、厂矿企业、事业单位的四清运动，发动了广大群众，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，撤了他们的职，狠狠地打击了坚持反动立场的地富反坏右分子。群众的社会主义积极性大大提高，生产不断增长。社会主义经济得到进一步巩固和发展。特别重要的是，经过四清运动，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，促进了人的思想革命化。所有这些，是任何人也抹杀不了的。真正的无产阶级革命派都说，四清运动好得很！那种“四清运动搞糟了”的论调，完全是阶级敌人的恶意攻击。
    阶级敌人叫嚷，“派四清工作队是错误的”，他们煽动一些不明真相的群众，把一般四清工作队员揪回去斗争，逼着工作队员给他们翻案。这是绝对不能允许的。
    四清运动，根据十条和二十三条的规定，派出工作队是正确的。问题不在于工作队的形式，而在于工作队是否执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是否相信群众、依靠群众、放手发动群众，是否把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。四清工作队员，绝大多数都是根据毛主席的教导和工人、贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，共同战斗，建立了深厚的阶级感情，对四清运动作出了贡献。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上那些牛鬼蛇神，阴谋策划乱斗四清工作队员，转移斗争的大方向。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，必须粉碎敌人的这种阴谋诡计，千万不要上当。
    还有些人叫嚷“打倒一切当权派”。
    打倒一切当权派是完全错误的。应该分清是无产阶级当权派还是走资本主义道路的当权派。应该认识党内走资本主义道路的当权派，只是一小撮。所谓“打倒一切当权派”，就是故意混淆无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路当权派的界限，故意混淆革命和反革命的界限，其目的就是要打倒无产阶级当权派，打倒在四清运动中成长起来的好的和比较好的干部，破坏四清运动的伟大成果，破坏无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。对于这种“打倒一切当权派”的谬论，必须痛加驳斥。
    农村人民公社、厂矿企业、事业单位的各级干部，大多数是好的和比较好的。特别是四清运动搞得好的地方，大多数干部立场坚定，工作积极，带头参加劳动。一小撮坏人要打倒他们，就是要对四清运动反攻倒算，打击群众，阴谋实行反革命复辟。一切革命的同志，对四清运动中成长起来的好的和比较好的干部，应当爱护，应该支持。对于他们工作中这样那样的缺点和错误，我们应该遵照毛主席的一贯教导，采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针，批评他们，帮助他们改正。
    无产阶级文化大革命的重点，是打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这是运动的大方向。在这场无产阶级和资产阶级的激烈而又复杂的阶级斗争中，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，必须保持清醒的头脑，不要上阶级敌人的当，牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向。决不允许党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪，翻四清的案。只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如果他们胆敢对四清运动进行反攻倒算，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，必须立即制裁，坚决实行无产阶级专政。
    工人阶级、贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，要联合起来，粉碎阶级敌人任何形式的新反扑，响应毛主席的伟大号召，“抓革命，促生产”，坚决保卫四清运动的伟大成果，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
