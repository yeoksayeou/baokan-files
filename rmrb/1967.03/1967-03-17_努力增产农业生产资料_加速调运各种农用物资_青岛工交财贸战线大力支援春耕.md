Workers in the industrial, transportation, financial, and commercial sectors of Qingdao are vigorously supporting spring plowing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 16th: The proletarian revolutionary factions in Qingdao's industrial, transportation, financial, and commercial sectors are working with a sense of urgency to increase production and accelerate the transportation of agricultural supplies, vigorously supporting spring plowing.

The proletarian revolutionary factions in Qingdao, who have seized all power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, deeply understand that ensuring a good harvest this year and achieving a good agricultural yield are crucial to the victory and consolidation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Many factories and enterprises have invested a large amount of manpower and resources since the beginning of the year to increase the production of agricultural materials and support spring plowing.

The revolutionary workers in the heavy industry system have significantly increased the production of major agricultural machinery such as gasoline engines, machine-drawn agricultural tools, and threshing machines in January and February compared to the same period last year. The value of agricultural machinery has increased by more than 50% compared to January and February last year. After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary factions at the Qingdao Agricultural Machinery Factory focused on revolution and production, completing the production task of machine-drawn disc harrows ahead of schedule and in excess of the quota in February. The revolutionary workers at the Internal Combustion Engine Factory paid great attention to the production of gasoline engines used for spring irrigation in rural areas. They completed the production task of gasoline engines for January and February in excess of the quota and delivered them immediately to the front lines of agricultural production.

The revolutionary workers at the Qingdao Power Supply Bureau, with high revolutionary enthusiasm and boundless energy, organized combat teams carrying red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations and electrical tools, rushed to the rural suburbs. During the day, they helped production teams and community members repair power lines and equipment; at night, they went to the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, pull electrical wires, and repair lights, receiving a warm welcome from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The revolutionary workers on the transportation and logistics front have displayed a brave fighting spirit, racing against time to transport agricultural supplies to the countryside. The revolutionary workers at the Qingdao Railway Bureau ensure that agricultural supplies are transported as soon as they are available and never accumulate. When the volume of goods passing through increases, they prioritize the transportation of agricultural supplies. The proletarian revolutionary factions at the Qingdao Automobile Transport Company have used every means to speed up the transportation of agricultural production materials. In just February, they transported 35,000 tons of fertilizers, seeds, agricultural tools, coal, and other agricultural supplies. The revolutionary workers at the Maritime Bureau, in supporting spring plowing, studied the "Three Articles" and established a public-spirited mindset. During the rush to transport agricultural supplies, they strived to tap into potential and increased the load capacity of ships. In February, they transported 47,000 tons of fertilizers, diesel, steel, and other supplies supporting spring plowing.

The proletarian revolutionary factions on the financial and commercial front, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, swept away the rules and regulations left by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and in accordance with Chairman Mao's directive of "developing the economy and ensuring supply," actively organized the supply of spring plowing and spring sowing materials. The revolutionary workers at the Qingdao Production Materials Wholesale Station, to ensure that materials supporting spring plowing are delivered on time and to the right places, conducted in-depth investigations and research in rural areas. In just January and February, they transported over 2,000 tons of agricultural tools and machinery needed for spring plowing and spring sowing, an increase of 1.7 times compared to the same period last year.

    努力增产农业生产资料　加速调运各种农用物资
    青岛工交财贸战线大力支援春耕
    据新华社济南十六日电　青岛市工业、交通、财贸战线上的无产阶级革命派，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，努力增产和加速调运农用物资，雷厉风行地支援春耕生产。
    从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺取了一切大权的青岛市无产阶级革命派，深深懂得搞好今年的春耕生产，夺取今年的农业好收成，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行和巩固无产阶级专政的大事。许多工厂企业今年以来投入了大批人力、物力，增产农业生产资料，支援春耕生产。
    重工业系统的革命职工今年一、二月份生产的汽油机、机引农具、脱粒机械等主要农业机具的产量，比去年同期都有较大幅度的增长，农业机械的产值比去年一、二月份增长百分之五十以上。青岛农业机械厂的无产阶级革命派在夺权以后，大抓革命，狠促生产，二月份提前超额完成了机引圆盘耙的生产任务。内燃机厂的革命职工，十分重视农村春灌用的汽油机的生产，他们超额完成了一、二月份汽油机的生产任务，并且随生产随交货，立即运送到农业生产第一线。
    青岛供电局革命职工，以高度的革命热情和冲天的干劲，组织了战斗队，带着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和电工工具，奔赴郊区农村，白天帮助生产队和社员检修供电线路和设备；夜晚到贫下中农家里，宣传毛泽东思想，并为贫下中农拉电线、修理电灯，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
    交通运输战线革命职工，发扬了勇敢战斗的作风，争分夺秒，赶运农业生产资料下乡。青岛铁路分局革命派工人对农用物资做到随有随运，决不积压。当货物通过数量增多时，他们就优先运输农用物资。青岛汽车运输公司的无产阶级革命派千方百计加快运输农业生产资料。仅仅二月份一个月，他们就运出了化肥、种子、农具、煤炭等农需物资三万五千多吨。海运局革命派工人们，在支援春耕生产中，大学“老三篇”，树立一心为公的思想，在抢运农用物资时努力挖掘潜力，增加了船舶的载重量，二月份共运输支援春耕生产的化肥、柴油、钢材等物资四万七千多吨。
    财贸战线的无产阶级革命派在春耕生产中，以毛泽东思想为武器，横扫党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所遗留下的清规戒律，遵照毛主席指示的“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，积极组织春耕、春种物资的供应工作。青岛生产资料批发站革命职工，为了使支援春耕的物资下放及时，供应对路，深入农村调查研究，仅一、二月份就调往农村春耕、春种所需要的农具、机械等二千多吨，比去年同期增加了一点七倍。
