The responsible official of the European and Soviet Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today delivered a verbal statement to the Soviet Embassy in China, strongly protesting the Soviet side's disregard for Chinese laws and persecution of Chinese workers employed at the Soviet Embassy in China. The statement said that the Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in China, Nadashev, and the Second Secretary and head of the Consular Section, Yedanov, not only bear direct responsibility for the persecution of Chinese workers but have also engaged in activities inconsistent with their diplomatic status. Therefore, the Chinese government declares Nadashev and Yedanov as persona non grata and orders them to leave Chinese territory immediately.

The statement said that Chinese workers employed at the Soviet Embassy in China and other Soviet institutions in China went on strike to protest the new anti-China crimes committed by the Soviet government since the bloody incident on Red Square on January 25. This is a sacred right granted to all Chinese citizens by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The strike by Chinese workers is completely just and revolutionary, and it is only right! After the strike period ended, the Chinese workers returned to the embassy to resume work, which is also natural. However, the Soviet side maliciously slandered them as "intruders" who "wreaked havoc" in the embassy premises, refused to allow them to return to work, and unilaterally decided to "dismiss" them. This is an extreme disregard for Chinese laws and a gross insult to the Chinese working class. The Soviet side's political persecution of Chinese workers is absolutely unacceptable.

The statement pointed out that all Chinese workers employed at the Soviet Embassy in China and other Soviet institutions in China, in protest against the Soviet side's political persecution of Chinese workers, collectively submitted their resignations to the Soviet Embassy and other Soviet institutions in China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China fully supports the Chinese workers' just actions and strongly protests the Soviet side's disregard for Chinese laws and persecution of Chinese workers.

The statement pointed out that the Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in China, Nadashev, and the Second Secretary and head of the Consular Section, Yedanov, bear direct responsibility for the persecution of Chinese workers in this incident. They have also engaged in activities inconsistent with their diplomatic status, with Nadashev even publicly assaulting Chinese citizens on Chinese territory. Therefore, the Chinese government declares Nadashev and Yedanov as persona non grata and orders them to leave Chinese territory immediately.

    我外交部苏欧司负责人受权向苏使馆发表口头声明
    最强烈抗议苏方无视中国法律迫害我职工
    宣布那达申和叶达诺夫为不受欢迎的人，并限令他们立即离开中国国境
    新华社十一日讯　中华人民共和国外交部苏欧司负责人今天受权向苏联驻中国大使馆发表口头声明，强烈抗议苏联方面无视中国法律，对在苏联驻中国大使馆工作的中国职工进行政治迫害。声明说，苏联驻中国大使馆二等秘书那达申和二等秘书、领事部负责人叶达诺夫，不仅在迫害中国职工的事件中负有直接责任，而且他们还从事与其外交官身份不相称的活动。为此，中国政府宣布那达申、叶达诺夫为不受欢迎的人，并限令他们二人立即离开中国国境。
    声明说，在苏联驻中国大使馆和苏联其他驻中国机构工作的中国职工，为了抗议苏联政府自一月二十五日制造红场流血事件以来连续犯下的反华新罪行，举行罢工。这是中华人民共和国宪法赋予所有中国公民的神圣权利。中国职工的罢工完全是正义的、革命的行动，好得很！在苏联驻中国大使馆工作的中国职工在罢工期满以后，到大使馆去复工，也是理所当然的。但是，苏联方面却恶毒地诬蔑他们是“闯入大使馆领域”去“胡作非为的暴徒”，悍然拒绝他们复工，并且片面决定“解雇”他们。这是对中国法律的极端蔑视，对中国工人阶级的粗暴侮辱，苏联方面对中国职工的政治迫害，是绝对不能容许的。
    声明指出，在苏联驻中国大使馆和苏联其他驻中国机构工作的全体中国职工，为了抗议苏联方面对中国职工的政治迫害，向苏联大使馆和苏联其他驻中国机构提出集体辞职。中华人民共和国外交部完全支持中国职工这一正当行动，并且对苏联方面无视中国法律，迫害中国职工，提出最强烈的抗议。
    声明指出，苏联驻中国大使馆二等秘书那达申和二等秘书、领事部负责人叶达诺夫在这次迫害中国职工的事件中负有直接的责任，并且对中国职工进行谩骂、诽谤、欺骗、威胁和侮辱。他们还从事与其外交官身份不相称的活动，那达申还公然在中国领土上殴打中国公民。为此，中国政府宣布那达申和叶达诺夫为不受欢迎的人，并限令他们立即离开中国国境。
