The revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Military Region Engineering Machinery Repair Factory have, during the Cultural Revolution, consistently adhered to the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have not neglected production for the sake of revolution, and have produced for the sake of revolution. Following the completion of last year's production plan, the factory has once again exceeded the production value plan for January and February of this year, with improved product quality. Several crucial engineering machinery and components urgently needed by construction units have been completed on schedule according to the plan.

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the factory faced a problem: many engineering machines awaiting repair were piled up in the workshop. If they could not be repaired in time, it would affect the spring construction of the troops. Some people thought that engaging in the Cultural Revolution would affect production, making it difficult to complete the production plan on time. The revolutionary workers of the factory, with this question in mind, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production" and the various policies stipulated by the Party Central Committee. They held three mass discussions to reach a consensus. Everyone unanimously expressed: Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions must be firmly implemented and followed. We must do a good job of revolution, promote production, and ensure that neither revolution nor production is neglected. We must resolutely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

During the movement, the revolutionary workers firmly grasped the direction of struggle, steadfastly defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They not only actively participated in the exposure, criticism, and struggle within the factory but also actively participated in the class struggle in society, exposing and resisting the counter-revolutionary economic wind. Through the struggles within and outside the factory, a large number of conscious, talented, and politically aware revolutionary pioneers emerged. Young female worker and active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Zhang Xiu Lan, worked modelly during the day and bravely exposed problems within the factory at night. Sometimes, she would go to the streets and alleys at midnight to propagate Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. She said, "Without Chairman Mao, how could there be the status of the working class? For the revolution, no matter how hard and tired it is, it should be done!"

The Cultural Revolution has promoted the ideological transformation of the people, greatly enhancing the sense of responsibility of revolutionary workers in production. Over the past few months, the revolutionary workers have, in accordance with the "Ten Provisions on Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" (Draft) issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, strictly adhered to their production posts and observed labor discipline. Once, a mass organization wanted to hold a collective activity, and the person in charge of the organization suggested that everyone go off duty half an hour early. Everyone firmly disagreed, saying, "Eight-hour production is stipulated by the Party Central Committee, and we absolutely cannot stop production to make revolution!" A young fitter in the second workshop was elected as the leader of a revolutionary organization. An old worker who worked with him in the same group said to this young worker, "You can rest assured to lead everyone in making revolution. I will take care of the work on the bench." He did as he said, creating a new method for processing screw caps, increasing work efficiency by four to five times. The workers in the first workshop also organized a production promotion team, going wherever there were urgent tasks, specializing in tackling the "hard bones" of the workshop. On the afternoon of February 23, several comrades in the third workshop worked continuously until late at night to complete the emergency task of trial-producing five sets of high-pressure valves, and delivered the goods the next morning. Before the Spring Festival, the factory had more than a hundred people planning to visit their families, but after seeing the State Council's notice that the Spring Festival would not be a holiday, they all voluntarily gave up their leave applications. Everyone said, "Grasping revolution and promoting production is a national affair, and personal interests should always be subordinate to the interests of the state."

The revolutionary workers of the Engineering Machinery Repair Factory believe that revolutionary cadres should play their due role in grasping revolution and promoting production, ensuring that the production team does not collapse, production command does not interrupt, and production order does not become chaotic. They combined the actual situation of the factory, seriously studied the editorials of the third, fourth, and fifth issues of the *Red Flag* magazine, and believed that most of the cadres in the factory were good or relatively good. To generally reject and overthrow them would be detrimental to both revolution and production. They conducted painstaking and meticulous ideological work on the leading cadres who made general mistakes through individual talks and small meetings, educating them to expose problems, touch the soul, take responsibility, lead production well, and make amends for their mistakes. Since the beginning of the movement, the production team of this factory has always been intact. In addition, various revolutionary mass organizations, in order to assist the production team in leading production, also sent production supervision representatives to regularly participate in the weekly production meetings, understand the production situation, propose suggestions for improving production management, and in production, commend good people and good deeds, inspiring everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm. During the Cultural Revolution, the various revolutionary mass organizations of this factory both grasped revolution and managed production. They closely cooperated with the factory's various levels of leadership production teams. When the production team issued production tasks, they immediately called on everyone to complete the plan quickly, efficiently, and economically; when they found that the workshop had a lax labor discipline, they immediately did ideological work with the workshop cadres. Once, they heard that a workshop cadre did not dare to work boldly for fear of not being obeyed by the masses, and immediately seized the lunch break to hold a meeting, using Chairman Mao's cadre policy to educate everyone. The workers thought it through and said: The words of cadres that conform to Mao Zedong Thought must be listened to. To overthrow everything and reject everything is not the attitude of revolutionary factions. The correct attitude should be to help revolutionary cadres get rid of wrong things and stand with the revolutionary masses, make revolution together, and promote production together.

At the beginning of the movement, this factory had more than 20 revolutionary mass organizations, which later merged into 9 during the struggle, with the largest having 200 people and the smallest only 3. They adhered to the principle that organizations are not divided by size and revolution is not divided by precedence. When handling major factory-wide affairs, they always insisted on joint consultation, thus achieving many major tasks together; holding criticism meetings together; holding meetings to grasp revolution and promote production together; organizing Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams together; responding to the State Council's initiative to not take leave during the Spring Festival together; and resisting the economic wind together, with very few instances of sabotaging each other. Although they had some differing views and sometimes had disagreements, whenever they encountered disputes that could not be resolved, some comrades acted out of emotion, they would study Chairman Mao's quotations: "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." Everyone would then calm down. They truly achieved unity in grasping the revolutionary direction and cooperation in promoting production. The workers of the repair team belonged to several different revolutionary organizations. Although they had differing opinions at the debate meeting, they immediately worked together to promote production upon returning to the workshop, completing the maintenance of eight machines three days ahead of schedule for February's plan. Because the direction of all mass organizations was consistent, they became more united in the struggle. After the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill's administrative unit-based great alliance was publicized, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "Everything for the victory of the front line, organizational tasks must be subordinate to political tasks," immediately dissolved their own organizations, and established a great alliance preparatory committee to lead the entire factory in the great alliance based on administrative units from the bottom up, making the situation of grasping revolution and promoting production better and better.

    在文化大革命中坚持抓革命促生产
    沈阳部队工程机械修配厂广大革命职工坚守生产岗位，遵守劳动纪律，多快好省地完成了生产计划
    据新华社沈阳十八日电　中国人民解放军沈阳部队工程机械修配厂的广大革命职工，在文化大革命中，一直坚持“抓革命，促生产”的方针，革命不忘生产，生产为了革命，全厂继去年完成生产计划后，今年一、二月份又超额完成产值计划，产品质量也有提高，一些为施工部队所急需的重要工程机械和配件，都如期按计划完成。
    这个厂在文化大革命开始的时候，面临着一个问题：许多待修的工程机械堆在厂房，如果不能及时抢修出来，就要影响部队春季施工。有的人认为搞文化大革命要影响生产，按时完成生产计划有困难。广大革命职工带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的指示和党中央规定的各项政策，连续进行了三次群众性的讨论，统一了认识。大家一致表示：毛主席、党中央的指示，一定要坚决执行，坚决照办，搞好革命，促进生产，保证革命、生产两不误，坚决地挑起了革命、生产两副重担。
    广大革命职工在运动中，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，坚定地保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们不仅积极参加厂内的揭发、批判和斗争，同时还积极参加了社会上的阶级斗争，识破并且顶住了反革命经济主义的妖风。通过厂内厂外的斗争，涌现出大批有觉悟，有才干，关心国家大事的革命闯将。青年女工、学习毛主席著作积极分子张秀兰，白天模范地搞生产，晚上勇敢地揭发厂内存在的问题，有时深夜里还到大街小巷，宣传毛主席的革命路线。她说：“没有毛主席，那有咱工人阶级的地位，为革命再苦再累也应该！”
    文化大革命促进了人的思想革命化，大大增强了革命工人的生产责任感。几个月来，广大革命职工按照《中共中央关于抓革命、促生产的十条规定（草案）》，严守生产岗位，遵守劳动纪律。有一次，有个群众组织要搞集体活动，这个组织的负责人建议大家提前三十分钟下班，大家坚决不同意，他们说：“八小时生产是党中央规定下来的，咱们绝不可以停产闹革命！”二车间一个青年钳工被选为革命组织的负责人，和他同组干活的一位老工人就对这个青年工人说：“你放心领导大家闹革命，案子上的活我包了。”他说到做到，创造了一种加工螺丝帽的新方法，提高工效四至五倍。一车间的工人还组织了促生产突击队，那里有紧急任务到那里去，专啃车间的“硬骨头”。二月二十三日下午，三车间为了完成试制五套高压阀的应急任务，几个同志一直干到深夜，第二天早晨就交了货。春节前，这个厂有一百多人准备探亲，看到国务院发出春节不放假的通知，都自觉地放弃了请假申请。大家都说：“抓革命、促生产是国家大事，个人利益应该永远服从于国家的利益。”
    工程机械修配厂的广大革命职工认为，应该让革命领导干部在抓革命、促生产中发挥应有的作用，保证生产班子不瘫痪，生产指挥不中断，生产秩序不紊乱。他们结合本厂实际情况，认真学习了《红旗》杂志三期、四期和五期的社论，认为厂里大多数干部是好的和比较好的，一概排斥，一概打倒，对革命、生产都不利。他们对犯有一般错误的领导干部通过个别谈话和开小会等形式，进行了艰苦细致的思想工作，教育他们揭问题，触灵魂，负起责任来，领导好生产，将功补过。这个厂自运动开始以来，生产班子始终是健全的。此外，各个革命群众组织为了协助生产班子领导好生产，还选派了监督生产的代表，定期参加每周的生产会议，了解生产情况，提出改进生产管理的意见，在生产中表扬好人好事，鼓舞大家的革命干劲。在文化大革命期间，这个厂的各个革命群众组织，既抓革命，又管生产，他们与厂的各级领导生产班子密切配合，当生产班子下达生产任务时，他们立即号召大家多、快、好、省地完成计划；当发现车间出现劳动纪律松弛的现象时，他们就和车间干部同时做群众的思想工作。有一次，他们听说有个车间干部不敢大胆工作，怕群众不服，马上抓紧午休时间开会，用毛主席的干部政策教育大家。工人们想通了，都说：干部讲的话，符合毛泽东思想的，一定要听。打倒一切，排斥一切，不是革命派的态度。正确的态度，应该是帮助革命干部丢掉错误的东西和革命群众站在一起，一起闹革命，一起促生产。
    运动初期，这个厂有二十多个革命群众组织，后来在斗争中逐渐合并，仍然有九个，人数多的二百人，少的才三个人。他们本着组织不分大小，革命不分先后的原则，在处理全厂性的大事时，始终坚持大家共同协商，因此作到了许多大事一起办；批判大会一起办；抓革命、促生产大会一起办；组织毛泽东思想宣传队一起办；响应国务院春节不放假通知的倡议一起办；反对经济主义的妖风一起办，极少发生互相拆台的现象。他们之间虽然有些观点不一致，互相间有时也有一些意见，但是每当遇到双方争执不下，有的同志意气用事的时候，就学习毛主席语录：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”大家也就心平气和了。他们在运动中真正做到了抓革命大方向一致，抓生产同心协力。包修组的工人分属几个不同的革命组织，在辩论会上虽然有意见分歧，但是回到车间马上同心协力搞生产，二月份计划维修五台机械，结果提前三天完成了八台。由于各群众组织大方向始终一致，在斗争中越来越团结。当贵阳棉纺厂按行政单位搞大联合的经验公布以后，他们遵照毛主席“一切为了前线的胜利，组织任务须服从于政治任务”的教导，立即解散了各自的组织，成立了大联合筹备委员会，领导全厂进行以行政单位为基础的自下而上的大联合，使抓革命、促生产的形势越来越好。
