	Capital
	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 18th, medical personnel from the capital's medical units have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and to shift the focus of health work to rural areas. They have joined rural medical teams and gone to the frontlines of agriculture to support spring plowing and serve the health of poor and lower-middle peasants. The first batch of rural medical teams, consisting of 570 people, has recently set off for Henan, Hubei, Guangxi, and other places. Currently, another 650 revolutionary medical personnel have formed the second batch of rural medical teams and are gradually setting out.

	Before departing, the medical teams held a "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production, Support the Frontlines of Spring Plowing" oath-taking rally, studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as the "Three Articles." The revolutionary medical team members were full of spirit and wrote determination letters filled with revolutionary passion. They carried Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's boundless concern for the poor and lower-middle peasants, with high political enthusiasm, rushing to the frontlines of rural areas to serve spring plowing.

	These medical teams all regard propagating Mao Zedong Thought as their glorious political task. Before departing, the medical team members all expressed that after arriving at the frontlines of agriculture, they would not only do a good job of preventing and treating diseases but also be good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. They would firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the great significance of "grasping revolution, promoting production," propagate the Party's policies, and inspire the masses' revolutionary and productive enthusiasm. Many medical team members also expressed their determination to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, reform their subjective world, establish a proletarian worldview, and wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, protect the labor force, and ensure that the labor production army completes the spring plowing production tasks on time.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 18th, currently, nearly 2,000 rural medical team members in the capital, with medicine boxes on their backs, are actively engaged in medical and preventive work on the frontlines of agricultural production in the Beijing suburbs, serving the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and serving spring plowing. Some medical team members who returned to their units to participate in the Cultural Revolution are now also actively preparing to return to the countryside and rush to the frontlines of spring plowing.

	The medical team members active in the rural areas of Beijing have been tempered in the fiery Cultural Revolution, raised their consciousness, and further understood the great significance of grasping revolution, promoting production, and shifting the focus of health work to rural areas. Many revolutionary medical team members have expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's teachings, exhibit a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, insist on not leaving their rural medical posts, wholeheartedly serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, guarantee the health of the broad masses of farmers, and contribute to spring plowing.

	Shandong
	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Jinan on the 17th, medical personnel from Shandong Province and Jinan City have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Recently, they organized more than 50 health work teams to go to rural areas, working with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to grasp revolution and promote production, and carry out mass health movements centered on preventing and treating diseases.

	Currently, it is the peak of spring plowing and also a time when spring infectious diseases are prone to spread. Rural areas urgently need to strengthen health and hygiene work to ensure the victory of the Cultural Revolution and spring plowing. Chairman Mao said in "On Coalition Government": "Peasants—these are the main objects of the cultural movement in the present stage in China. What is meant by the elimination of illiteracy, what is meant by universal education, what is meant by mass art and literature, what is meant by national hygiene, all become empty words if separated from the 360 million peasants." Based on the current situation, medical personnel from Shandong Province and Jinan City reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the shortest time, they mobilized more than 1,000 medical personnel to form more than 50 rural health work teams, going to the production frontlines in more than 30 counties in seven regions including Heze, Jining, and Liaocheng, carrying out mass health movements centered on preventing and treating diseases.

	Shanxi
	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Taiyuan on the 18th, revolutionary mass organizations in the health sector of Shanxi Province have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," recently sending personnel to the frontlines of industrial and agricultural production to carry out spring health and epidemic prevention work.

	After seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party in the Shanxi Provincial Health Department, the proletarian revolutionary faction in the health sector established the Disease Prevention Office and mobilized 450 medical and health personnel to form rural health work teams. They went to Jinzhong, Jincheng, Xinzhou, and other regions to carry out epidemic prevention and health work. The revolutionary rebel headquarters in more than 30 counties, including Jinzhong, Jincheng, and Xinxian, also established disease prevention leadership groups or combat teams, mobilizing 950 medical personnel to form more than 100 disease prevention combat groups to carry out disease prevention and treatment work in various places.

	The Shanxi Provincial Military Region and the Jinzhong Military Sub-district held special meetings and sent medical personnel to assist local health departments in carrying out spring health and epidemic prevention work.

	Medical personnel participating in spring health and epidemic prevention work seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works in their work, taking the "Three Articles" as their motto, striving to reform their worldview. They eat, live, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants, carrying forward the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of saving the wounded and rescuing the sick, actively contributing to industrial and agricultural production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Guiyang
	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Guiyang on the 18th, the proletarian revolutionary factions in the provincial and municipal medical departments of the Guiyang region have firmly responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Since February, they have organized more than 400 medical personnel to go to remote mountain villages, deeply into the frontlines of spring plowing, to prevent and treat diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants, receiving praise from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

	After receiving the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to all poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural areas nationwide, revolutionary medical personnel have expressed their determination to the Party, submitted applications, and actively requested to join the rural mobile medical teams to support spring plowing production, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, serve revolutionary peasants, and contribute to this year's agricultural harvest.

	Medical personnel who went down to the countryside took Zhang Thiede and Norman Bethune as examples, living, eating, and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants after arriving in the countryside, and wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants while studying Chairman Mao's works together. They propagated Mao Zedong Thought wherever they went. While treating diseases for community members, they propagated knowledge about preventing and treating spring infectious diseases; they also launched a patriotic hygiene movement centered on preventing spring infectious diseases with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many medical teams also listed training rural health workers as an important task for this round of mobile medical work. Zhejiang

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hangzhou on the 20th, several medical and health units and five medical and pharmaceutical colleges in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City recently mobilized more than 1,000 medical and health personnel and graduates to form more than 70 work teams. They rushed to the frontlines of spring plowing in various rural areas of the province to carry out disease prevention and treatment work, contributing their strength to ensuring the victory of the Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production. Before setting out, many medical and health personnel expressed that after going to the countryside, they would actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making the disease prevention and treatment work teams into big schools of Mao Zedong Thought.
