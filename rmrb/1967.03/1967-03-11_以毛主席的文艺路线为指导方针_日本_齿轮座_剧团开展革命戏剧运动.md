	Guided by Chairman Mao's literary line, the Japanese "Gear Playhouse" troupe in Yamaguchi Prefecture is resolutely fighting against Japanese revisionists and advancing the revolutionary drama movement, taking Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as their guiding principle.

	Not long ago, the directors, actors, and staff of the "Gear Playhouse" troupe, filled with boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao and boundless respect for Mao Zedong Thought, spoke to Chinese reporters about their experiences in practicing drama art while striving to learn from "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

	The friends of the "Gear Playhouse" troupe highly praise Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as the guiding book for the Japanese revolutionary drama movement. A young actor said: "When I was in college, I joined a drama group. The first literary theory book I read was Chairman Mao's brilliant work 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.' He excitedly said: Chairman Mao's brilliant work, 'every word and sentence is truth. It inspires us to engage in drama activities for the broad masses of workers and peasants in Japan. I think this speech is the guiding book for the Japanese revolutionary drama movement.'"

	"Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is also the compass for Japanese revolutionary literary workers. A young actor of the "Gear Playhouse" said: Chairman Mao pointed out in this speech the problem of for whom our literature and art serve. He said: Chairman Mao taught us that revolutionary literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve the people. I repeatedly read Chairman Mao's speech and use the standards proposed by Chairman Mao to examine my artistic practice. A director said: Based on my own experience, without Mao Zedong Thought, one would definitely take a path completely opposite to Chairman Mao's instructions. Therefore, we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary line.

	Since its establishment in 1952, this troupe has consistently adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line as its guiding principle, continuously fighting against the influence of bourgeois literary trends in an irreconcilable struggle. A responsible member of the troupe said: "Since the establishment of the 'Gear Playhouse' troupe fifteen years ago, it has been fifteen years of struggle between the revolutionary literary direction proposed by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois literary direction."

	Since the second half of last year, Japanese revisionists have escalated their sabotage of the activities of the "Gear Playhouse" troupe. After a serious struggle, the members of the "Gear Playhouse" troupe drove out a small group of revisionist saboteurs within the troupe, defending the glorious tradition of the "Gear Playhouse" troupe.

    以毛主席的文艺路线为指导方针
    日本“齿轮座”剧团开展革命戏剧运动
    新华社东京九日电  正在同日本修正主义分子坚决进行斗争的日本山口县“齿轮座”剧团把毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，作为开展日本革命戏剧运动的指针。
    不久前，“齿轮座”剧团的导演、演员和工作人员怀着对毛主席无限热爱和对毛泽东思想无限敬仰心情，向中国记者畅谈他们在戏剧艺术的实践中，努力学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的体会。
    “齿轮座”剧团的朋友们高度赞扬毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是日本革命戏剧运动的指导书。一位青年演员说：“我在大学念书时，就参加了戏剧小组，我最早阅读的文艺理论书，就是毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇光辉著作。他激动地说：毛主席的这篇光辉巨著，“一字一句都是真理，它鼓舞我们去从事为日本广大工农群众服务的戏剧活动。我认为这篇讲话是日本革命戏剧运动的指导书。”
    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》也是日本革命文艺工作者的方向盘。“齿轮座”的青年演员说：毛主席在这篇讲话中指出了我们的文艺为什么人服务的问题。”他说：“毛主席教导我们革命文艺应当为工农兵服务，为人民大众服务。我反复地阅读毛主席这篇讲话，并且用毛主席提出的标准来检查自己的艺术实践。”一位导演说：根据自己的体会，离开了毛泽东思想，就必定走上一条与毛主席的指示完全相反的道路。因此，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席的文艺路线。
    这个剧团从一九五二年成立的那一天起，就坚持以毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线为指导方针，不断地同资产阶级文艺思潮的影响展开了不调和的斗争。剧团的一位负责人员说：“齿轮座”剧团成立后的十五年，“是毛主席提出的革命的文艺方向和资产阶级文艺方向进行斗争的十五年。”
    从去年下半年以来，日本修正主义分子破坏“齿轮座”剧团的活动变本加厉。“齿轮座”剧团的团员经过一场严重的斗争，把剧团内的一小撮修正主义破坏分子赶出去，保卫了“齿轮座”剧团的光荣传统。
