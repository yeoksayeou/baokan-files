Recent victories have been reported from the battlefields of South Vietnam. Liberation armed forces have shown great prowess, driving the American aggressors into a state of disarray. In Quang Ngai Province, the liberation armed forces have annihilated over a thousand American soldiers in a series of battles. The U.S. air base in Da Nang has been repeatedly subjected to fierce artillery attacks, resulting in heavy losses. This is a powerful response from the people of South Vietnam to the U.S. imperialists' scheme of "forcing peace through war."

The U.S. imperialists, unable to achieve their goal of coercing peace, have resorted to escalating the war, hoping to force the Vietnamese people to submit. This is a futile attempt. The heroic Vietnamese people have long experienced the U.S. imperialists' war "escalation." The more the American aggressors expand the war, the more they fail miserably.

Chairman Mao said: "If they want to fight, we will annihilate them completely. That's how it is. They come to attack, and we annihilate them. The more we annihilate, the more comfortable we feel. Complete annihilation means complete comfort."

Like all reactionaries, the U.S. imperialists are stubborn and will not relent until they see the coffin. For this unyielding aggressor, there is only one way to deal with them: hit them hard and decisively. The Vietnamese people, continuing their efforts, will definitely be able to defeat the U.S. imperialists, this mad beast, completely and comfortably.

    彻底消灭，彻底舒服
    越南南方战场上最近捷报频传，各地的解放武装力量大显神威，把美国侵略者打得落花流水。西宁省的解放武装力量，连续几仗就消灭了一千多美军。岘港美国空军基地一再遭到猛烈炮轰，损失惨重。这是南越人民对美帝国主义“以战迫和”的阴谋的有力回答。
    美帝国主义诱和不成，就想迫和，大搞战争
  “升级”，妄想迫使越南人民屈服。这是异想天开。对于美帝国主义的战争“升级”，英雄的越南人民早就领教过了。美国侵略者越是扩大战争，就失败得越惨。
    毛主席说：“如果他们要打，就把他们彻底消灭。事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。”
    美帝国主义同一切反动派一样，是不见棺材不落泪的。对于美帝国主义这个顽固不化的侵略者，只有一个对付的办法：狠狠地打，坚决地打。越南人民再接再厉，照这样打下去，一定能把美帝国主义这只疯狂的野兽打得彻底失败，彻底舒服。
