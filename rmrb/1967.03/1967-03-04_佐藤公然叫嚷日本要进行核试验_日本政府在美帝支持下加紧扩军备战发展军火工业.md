	Japan's government head Sato recently shouted that Japan "has the right to conduct nuclear tests." He also expressed that Japan should "do its utmost" for the U.S. imperialists' "war for peace" plot in Vietnam.

	On the eve of the implementation of Japan's so-called "Third Plan for Strengthening Defense Forces," Sato's outburst once again exposed the Japanese reactionaries' mad ambition to follow the U.S. imperialists, collude with Soviet revisionists, accelerate military expansion, and oppose China and the revolutionary peoples of Asia.

	Japan's so-called "Third Plan for Strengthening Defense Forces" will be implemented in April this year. The Japanese "Defense Agency" admits that this new military expansion plan is "based on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system." It is an ambitious military plan for external aggression and expansion, and internal promotion of militarism.

	According to Japanese newspapers, sending troops abroad and directly participating in U.S. aggression is an important feature of this plan. In the coming years, the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" will establish a mobile force equipped with helicopters and other equipment. Once the U.S. needs it, this force can be quickly deployed. Additionally, Japan's new military expansion plan emphasizes equipping the "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear delivery systems, turning the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" into an aggressive force subordinate to the U.S. comprehensive strategy, capable of waging nuclear war.

	Under the strong support of the U.S., Japan has implemented two military expansion plans in the past few years. Currently, the total number of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" is 270,000, with a total tonnage of ships at 140,000 tons, 1,500 aircraft, and 800 tanks. The military bases and facilities of the "Self-Defense Forces" number over 1,430.

	The equipment needed for Japan's new military expansion plan will be manufactured domestically, thus this plan will further accelerate the militarization of Japan's industry. Japanese monopolistic conglomerates are currently in fierce competition, vying for military orders. At a recent so-called "National Defense Committee" meeting, 30 representatives of Japanese monopolistic conglomerates demanded that the "National Defense Plan" be revised annually to meet the needs of the military industry.

	Japan's military industry has rapidly expanded with the U.S. continuously escalating its aggression in Vietnam and Japan implementing its first and second military expansion plans. Currently, Japanese monopolistic conglomerates have established a complete military industrial system, including important sectors such as weapons, vehicles, aircraft, communications, electronics, ships, and missiles. There are over 1,200 large factories engaged in military production, and over 25,000 small and medium-sized factories providing processing for these large factories.

	The Sato government's acceleration of military expansion and following the U.S. imperialists' aggression will not end well. In the face of the powerful development of the Chinese people and the rapid rise of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, it can only meet a more miserable fate than Tojo Hideki.

### 佐藤公然叫嚷日本要进行核试验  日本政府在美帝支持下加紧扩军备战发展军火工业

    佐藤公然叫嚷日本要进行核试验
    日本政府在美帝支持下加紧扩军备战发展军火工业
    本报讯　日本政府头目佐藤最近叫嚷，日本“有权进行核试验”。他并且表示，日本要为美国在越南的“以战迫和”阴谋“尽它最大的努力”。
    在日本所谓“第三个充实防御力量计划”即将付诸实施的前夕，佐藤的叫嚣，又一次暴露了日本反动派追随美帝、勾结苏修、加紧扩军备战、反对中国和亚洲革命人民的疯狂野心。
    日本所谓“第三个充实防御力量计划”将在今年四月份开始实施。日本“防卫厅”承认，这个新的扩军备战计划是“以日美安全条约体制为基础”的。它是一个野心勃勃的对外进行侵略扩张、对内推进军国主义化的军事计划。
    据日本报纸透露，向外国派遣军队，直接参与美国的侵略活动，是这个计划的重要特点。在未来几年中，日本“自卫队”将建立一支由直升飞机等装备构成的机动部队。一旦美国需要，这支部队便可以迅速出动。另外，日本新的扩军计划着重要以核运载系统去装备“自卫队”三军，使日本“自卫队”成为一支附属于美国全面战略的、能够进行核战争的侵略部队。
    在美国大力扶植下，过去几年中，日本已先后实施了两个扩军备战计划。目前日本“自卫队”三军总人数已达二十七万人，军舰总吨位十四万吨，飞机一千五百架，坦克八百辆。“自卫队”的军事基地和军事设施达一千四百三十多个。
    日本新的扩军计划所需装备，将由本国制造，因此，这个计划将进一步加速日本工业的军事化。日本各垄断财团目前正在激烈争吵，抢夺军事订货。最近举行的一次所谓“国防委员会”会议上，三十名日本垄断财团代表要求今后每年修改一次“国防计划”，以满足军火工业的需求。
    日本军火工业是随着美国不断扩大侵略越南战争和日本实施第一、二个扩军计划而迅速扩大起来的。目前日本垄断财团，已经建立起了包括武器、车辆、飞机、通讯、电子、舰船、导弹等重要部门的完整的军事工业体系，从事军火生产的大工厂有一千二百多家，为这些工厂加工的中小工厂有两万五千多家。
    佐藤政府加紧扩军备战，追随美帝侵略，是决不会有好结果的。在中国人民力量强大发展和亚洲人民革命斗争迅速高涨的形势下，它只能遭到比东条英机更惨的下场。
