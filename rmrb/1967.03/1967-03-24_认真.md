    Seriousness
    Soldier Zhou Lide

    Chairman Mao said: “In the world, one fears only the words ‘seriousness.’ The Communist Party values ‘seriousness’ the most.”

    The spirit of “seriousness” is needed to transform both the objective world and the subjective world.

    The character “self” is a filthy thing formed by thousands of years of exploitative systems, deeply rooted. To seize the power of “self” in one's mind, one must seriously carry out a self-revolution.

    First, one must be serious about exposing. This means to take out all the dirty goods of the bourgeoisie and display them, without leaving a single bit. One must dare to expose old problems and new problems; one must dare to expose in front of a few people and in front of many; one must dare to expose what others know on the surface and what is hidden deep in the soul that others cannot see; one must not fear ugliness, not fear touching the soul, not fear losing dignity, and not fear losing prestige.

    Second, one must be serious about fighting. This means using Mao Zedong Thought as the most powerful ideological weapon to cleanse the “mud and dirt” deep in the soul, to engage in close combat and “bayonet fighting” with the selfish thoughts deep in the soul. Toward the character “self,” one can only take the initiative to attack, not passively defend; one must be strict, not lenient; one must confront directly, not coexist peacefully.

    Third, one must be serious about changing. This means to resolutely break down the character “self” and establish the character “public,” to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, and to liberate oneself from the character “self.” The character “self” is a stubborn enemy. To eliminate it, one must exert all efforts, be meticulous; one must always, everywhere, and in everything insist on the character “public” taking the lead; one must be prepared for a “protracted war” strategically, but for each specific battle and skirmish, one must fight a “quick decisive battle” and “annihilation battle.”

    Only in this way can one seize the power of the character “self” in one's mind and have the character “public” control the soul. Only in this way can one truly master Mao Zedong Thought, carry out ideological revolutionization, and become a communist warrior of our great era.

    毛主席说：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”
    “认真”精神，改造客观世界需要，改造主观世界也需要。
    “私”字，是几千年的剥削制度形成的脏东西，根深蒂固。要在自己的头脑里夺“私”字的权，必须“认真”地进行自我革命。
    一是要“认真”亮。这就是把资产阶级的肮脏货全部拿出来示众，一星半点也不留。老问题敢亮，新问题也敢亮；人少时敢亮，人多时也敢亮；别人知道的表面现象敢亮，灵魂深处别人瞧不见的也敢亮；不怕丑，不怕触及灵魂，不怕丢掉尊严，不怕失去威信。
    二是要“认真”斗。这就是以毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，来荡涤灵魂深处的“污泥浊水”，同灵魂深处的私心杂念“打近战”，“拚刺刀”。对“私”字，只能主动进攻，不能消极防御；只能“严”字当头，不能“宽宏大量”；只能针锋相对，不能“和平共处”。
    三是要“认真”改。这就是要坚决地大破“私”字，大立“公”字，发扬彻底革命精神，把自己从“私”字中间解放出来。“私”字是个顽敌。要破除它，必须全力以赴，一丝不苟；要时时、处处、事事坚持“公”字挂帅；要在战略上准备打“持久战”，但对每一个具体战役、战斗必须打“速决战”、“歼灭战”。
    只有这样，才能把自己头脑里“私”字的权夺过来，由“公”字掌握我们的灵魂大权。只有这样，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手，搞好思想革命化，成为我们伟大时代的共产主义战士。
