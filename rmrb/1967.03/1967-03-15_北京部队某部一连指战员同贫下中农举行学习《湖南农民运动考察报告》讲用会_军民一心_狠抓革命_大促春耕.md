Soldiers and Poor Peasants Jointly Study "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan"
Army and People United, Seize the Revolution, Promote Spring Plowing

Xinhua News Agency, March 14th – The soldiers of a company from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, while supporting rural spring plowing production, have been studying Chairman Mao's works together with local poor peasants. In their studies, they exchange ideas and learn from each other. Recently, they jointly held a study session on "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Poor peasants and soldiers shared their insights and experiences, expressing their determination not to let Chairman Mao down, to seize the revolution, and to promote spring plowing production, aiming for a double victory in revolution and production.

Chairman Mao always thinks of the poor peasants; we must be the main force in seizing the revolution and promoting production

At the beginning of the study session, soldier Jia Yin'an read "A Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." After hearing it, the team leader of the production brigade and poor peasant, Qian Baofu, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao is always with us in heart. Forty years ago, in this brilliant work, 'Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan,' with the most ardent class feelings and the most vivid language, Chairman Mao sang praises for the revolutionary mass movement, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and striking a heavy blow to the arrogance of the landlord class. Now, Chairman Mao is leading the people in a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, uprooting the roots of capitalist restoration. In the cultural revolution, Chairman Mao trusts the revolutionary masses the most, receiving the Red Guards eight times. As soon as spring arrives, he writes a letter to us poor peasants and rural cadres, which is like a timely rain. Chairman Mao always thinks of the poor peasants, does everything for the poor peasants, and is with us poor peasants in heart. We will respond to Chairman Mao's instructions with a thousand affirmations and ten thousand actions. We poor peasants must be the main force in seizing the revolution and promoting production. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will go; wherever there are difficulties, we will go, to be the vanguard of the revolution and models of production."

As soon as Qian Baofu finished speaking, another poor peasant, Qian Baoxiang, said: "I will forever be a member of the revolutionary vanguard. In the past, I did not want to manage the team's affairs, thinking that by not interfering too much, I could avoid offending people. Later, I studied 'Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan.' Chairman Mao said: 'Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you strike them, you strike the revolution.' Forty years ago, Chairman Mao regarded us poor peasants as so important. We must fight for Chairman Mao's honor! In the old society, my family's ancestors worked as long-term laborers for the landlords for three generations. My grandfather was driven to death by the landlords, and my father was killed by the Japanese invaders. Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, how could I have my today! But in the past, I did not care about collective affairs. This is not the thought of a poor peasant! In the old society, we poor peasants were like cattle and horses, but in the new society, we poor peasants are the masters. If we do not speak up, who will? If we do not manage, who will? We poor peasants must hold the reins firmly and must not let Chairman Mao down."

From then on, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings. Whoever harms collective interests and disrupts production, I would not agree with them. In labor, I would not fall behind. When going up the mountain to cut vines, I would cut vines; when it was time to take out the manure, I would take out the manure. Wherever there were difficulties, I would go. When my hands ached and my waist hurt, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, and I found endless strength. Recently, Chairman Mao wrote a letter to us poor peasants and rural cadres, saying that we poor peasants are the main force in seizing the revolution and promoting production in the countryside. We must have the spirit of poor peasants, stand tall, and take up the heavy responsibility of seizing the revolution and promoting production, forever following Chairman Mao to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Chairman Mao trusts the poor peasants so much; we must take up the responsibility and do a good job

Qian Baoxiang's words stirred up a warm round of applause from the soldiers and poor peasants. Li Rongchun, a 54-year-old chairman of the poor peasants' association, spoke next amid the applause. He said: "This year, as soon as spring arrived, everyone elected me as the chairman of the poor peasants' association. At that time, I thought that I had no education and no experience, so I could not do it well and it was better not to do it. The party secretary saw through my thoughts and helped me study 'Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan.' Chairman Mao's words, every word and every sentence, are like a blazing sun, illuminating my heart. Chairman Mao said: 'Without the poor peasant class (in the words of the gentry, without the "ruffians"), it is impossible to create the current revolutionary situation in the countryside, impossible to overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentry, and complete the democratic revolution. The poor peasants, because they are the most revolutionary, have taken the leadership of the peasant associations.' In the past, the poor peasants in Hunan fought against the local tyrants and divided the land, becoming the vanguard of the revolution; now, Chairman Mao regards us poor peasants as the main force in seizing the revolution and promoting production. Chairman Mao trusts the poor peasants so much, but I see a heavy burden and want to pass it on to others, picking the light ones to carry. This is not like a poor peasant. Having no education and no experience are small matters; having no thought of serving the people is a big problem. In the old society, those who held power in our village were either from the east or west courtyard, or from the north or south shop. At that time, they held meetings, and we could not even look. Today, everyone elected me as the chairman of the poor peasants' association. This is to let me represent the poor peasants to be the masters. How can I not do it? I am determined not to let Chairman Mao down and will definitely do a good job for the poor peasants. In the current spring plowing production, I always take on the heavy tasks; in my work, I often seek everyone's opinions and study Chairman Mao's works with everyone. The community members say I am a good leader. I think: I have only done a little bit of what the poor peasants should do."

The poor peasants' boundless love for Chairman Mao moved every soldier.

Learning from Chairman Mao's works enthusiastically, Wang Xianggui, a soldier who has been awarded the Second Class Merit Citation, spoke, expressing his determination to learn humbly from the poor peasants. He said: "This time, living, working, and studying with the poor peasants in the countryside, the noble qualities of the poor peasants have deeply educated me. I will forever learn humbly from the poor peasants."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The main force that has been fighting hard in the countryside is the poor peasants. From the secret period to the open period, the poor peasants have been actively fighting. They listen to the Communist Party's leadership the most. They are mortal enemies with the local tyrants and evil gentry, and they attack the camp of the local tyrants and evil gentry without hesitation." This time, we came to the countryside and saw with our own eyes that the broad poor peasants, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "seize the revolution and promote production," have turned the revolutionary enthusiasm released in the proletarian cultural revolution into spring plowing production. Some production teams completed the spring plowing preparations in less than two months that took several months last year, and some production teams expanded the cultivated land area. The poor peasants' deep class feelings of loving Chairman Mao and listening to Chairman Mao's words have given me a vivid class education. I deeply feel that the poor peasants have the brightest eyes and the reddest hearts. They love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Every word and every action of theirs are examples for me to learn from. I must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, learn humbly from the poor peasants, and forever be a student of the masses.

Medical orderly Liu Guohua also shared his thoughts. He expressed his determination to forever be a promoter of the revolutionary mass movement. He said, Chairman Mao calls on the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses. I did not understand this instruction deeply in the past. Before coming to the countryside this time, I studied "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary comrades must know: the national revolution needs a great change in the countryside. The Xinhai Revolution did not have this change, so it failed. Now there is this change, which is an important factor in the completion of the revolution. All revolutionary comrades must support this change, otherwise they will stand on the side of counter-revolution." In the current proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside, the revolutionary army with the poor peasants as the backbone, in order to prevent the restoration of capitalism, uproot the roots of revisionism, consolidate and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat in the countryside, launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the party in the countryside who are taking the capitalist road. This is a revolution of great historical significance. The broad poor peasants, while seizing the revolution, also promote spring plowing production. In production, they are full of enthusiasm, and many things are done faster and better than before. We are the children of the people and should stand firmly with the people, and together with them, take up the heavy responsibility of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

As soon as I arrived in the countryside, I propagated to the poor peasants the great significance of Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," studied Chairman Mao's works with the poor peasants, participated in labor and production with them, and treated the poor peasants. Once, I heard the political instructor say that the Zongjiawa Production Brigade had an outbreak of influenza. At that time, I did not even have time to eat or drink, I put on my medicine bag and rushed to Zongjiawa. In the village, I went from door to door to treat the poor peasants and propagate Chairman Mao's instructions of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." I treated one family after another, propagating while treating, until it was dark. The next day, I put on my medicine bag again and went to Zongjiawa to continue treating the patients and propagating to the masses. Many poor peasants were deeply moved. Poor peasant Chen Grandma said: "I will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness. Although I am old, I will also bear a part of the responsibility of seizing the revolution and promoting production." Chairman Mao's thoughts guide me to do a little for the poor peasants. In the future, I will forever be a promoter of the revolutionary mass movement.

At the end of the study session, the poor peasants and soldiers unanimously expressed that in the future, they would better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, change their thoughts, follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," forever march forward, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The People's Liberation Army, which fights side by side with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, never forgets the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings at every moment, most resolutely supports the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and promotes the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. The picture shows the members of the revolutionary committee of Xijiao Production Brigade, Xigu District, Shimenkou People's Commune, Pingding County, Shanxi Province, studying Chairman Mao's works with the local garrison soldiers.

    北京部队某部一连指战员同贫下中农举行学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》讲用会
    军民一心　狠抓革命　大促春耕
    新华社十四日讯　人民解放军北京部队某部一连指战员在支援农村春耕生产中，同当地贫下中农一起，结合当前春耕生产和自己的思想，活学活用毛主席著作。在学习中，他们相互交流，共同提高。最近，他们联合举行了一次学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》的讲用会。贫下中农和指战员们在会上谈心得、讲体会，表示决不辜负毛主席的教导，狠抓革命，猛促春耕生产，夺取革命、生产的双胜利。
    毛主席处处想到贫下中农，我们一定当好抓革命促生产的主力军
    讲用会一开始，解放军战士贾印安宣读了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》。生产大队团支部书记、贫农社员钱宝富听了后，激动地说：毛主席永远和我们心连心。他说：四十年前，毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》这篇光辉著作里，以最炽烈的阶级感情，最生动的语言，满腔热情地歌颂了革命的群众运动，大长了革命群众的志气，大灭了地主阶级的威风。现在毛主席又领导全国人民发动了轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，狠挖资本主义复辟的根子。在文化大革命中，毛主席最相信革命群众，八次接见红卫兵小将。刚一入春，他又给咱们贫下中农和农村干部写了信，这真是一场及时雨。毛主席处处想到贫下中农，事事为着贫下中农，和咱们贫下中农心连心。毛主席的指示，咱们一千个响应，一万个照办，我们贫下中农一定要当好抓革命、促生产的主力军，毛主席指到哪里，咱们就干到哪里；哪里有困难，我们就到哪里去，当革命的闯将，做生产的模范。
    钱宝富话音刚落，贫农社员钱宝祥接着说：我要永远当革命的主力队员。以往，我不愿多管队里的事，认为少管点闲事，免得得罪人。后来我学习了《湖南农民运动考察报告》，毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”四十年前毛主席就把咱贫下中农看得这样重要，咱得为毛主席争口气！旧社会，我家祖辈三代给地主当长工，爷爷被地主逼死了，父亲被日本侵略军杀害了，不是毛主席和共产党，哪会有我的今天！可是，我以往对集体的事情不关心，这哪是贫农的思想呀！旧社会咱贫下中农做牛做马，新社会咱贫下中农当家作主，队里的事咱不说，谁说？咱不管，谁管？咱贫下中农得掌好印把子，决不能辜负毛主席的期望。
    从这以后，我按毛主席说的办，谁损害集体利益、破坏生产，我就不答应他们。劳动中，咱也不落后，上山割荆条子活重，我就割荆条；出圈肥累，我就出圈肥。哪里有困难，我就到哪里。手疼、腰酸时，我一想起毛主席的教导，就添了无穷的力量。最近，毛主席又给咱贫下中农和农村干部来了信，说咱贫下中农是农村抓革命、促生产的主力军，咱就得有股贫下中农的骨气，要挺起腰杆，把抓革命、促生产的重担挑起来，永远跟着毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席这样相信贫下中农，我们一定挑起重担，作好工作
    钱宝祥的话，激起了战士和贫下中农的热烈掌声。五十四岁的贫协主任李荣春在掌声中接着发言，他说：今年一开春，大伙选我当贫协主任，当时我想，咱没文化、没经验，干不好，不如不干。党支部书记看透了我的心思，就帮助我学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》。毛主席的话，字字句句象一轮火红的太阳，照透了我的心。毛主席说：“没有贫农阶级（照绅士的话说，没有“痞子”），决不能造成现时乡村的革命状态，决不能打倒土豪劣绅，完成民主革命。贫农，因为最革命，所以他们取得了农会的领导权。”当年湖南贫下中农打土豪，分田地，成为革命的先锋；现在毛主席又把咱贫下中农当作抓革命、促生产的主力军。毛主席这样相信贫下中农，可是我见了重担子就想推给人家，自己拣轻的挑，这就不象贫下中农的样子。没文化，没经验，都是小事，头脑里没有为人民服务的思想才是大毛病。在旧社会，咱们村里拿大权的，不是东西院，就是南北店。那时，人家开会，咱看一眼都不行。今天大伙选我当贫协主任，这是要我代表贫下中农当家，我还能不干吗？我决心不辜负毛主席的期望，一定为贫下中农当好家。在当前的春耕生产中，我处处拣重活干；在工作中我经常征求大家的意见，还和大家一起学习毛主席著作。社员们说我是个好带头人。我心想：我只办了咱贫下中农一点份内的事。
    毛主席号召人民解放军积极支持左派广大群众，我们子弟兵一定和群众一道夺取革命、生产双丰收
    贫下中农无限热爱毛主席的心情，激动着每一个解放军战士。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、荣立二等功的王祥贵发言，表示要虚心向贫下中农学习。他说：这次在农村和贫下中农生活在一起，劳动在一起，学习在一起，贫下中农的高贵品质使我受到了深刻的教育。我要永远虚心地向贫下中农学习。
    毛主席教导我们：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。从秘密时期到公开时期，贫农都在那里积极奋斗。他们最听共产党的领导。他们和土豪劣绅是死对头，他们毫不迟疑地向土豪劣绅营垒进攻。”这次我们来到农村，亲眼看到广大贫下中农，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲，落实到春耕生产中来。有的生产队不到两个月完成了去年几个月的春耕准备工作，有的生产队扩大了耕地面积。贫下中农无限热爱毛主席，一心一意听毛主席的话的深厚阶级感情，给我上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。我深深地感到：贫下中农的眼最亮，心最红，他们最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，每句话，每个行动，都是我学习的榜样。我一定要牢记毛主席的教导，虚心向贫下中农学习，永远当群众的小学生。
    卫生员刘国华也谈了自己的感想。他表示要永远做革命群众运动的促进派。他说，毛主席号召人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众，我对这一指示过去理解不深。这次到农村前，我学习了《湖南农民运动考察报告》，毛主席说：“一切革命同志须知：国民革命需要一个大的农村变动。辛亥革命没有这个变动，所以失败了。现在有了这个变动，乃是革命完成的重要因素。一切革命同志都要拥护这个变动，否则他就站到反革命立场上去了。”在当前农村的无产阶级文化大革命中，以贫下中农为骨干的革命大军，为了防止资本主义复辟，铲除修正主义根子，巩固和保卫农村中的无产阶级专政，向农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。这是一场具有伟大历史意义的革命。广大贫下中农在大抓革命的同时，还猛促春耕生产。他们在生产中干劲冲天，许多事情比以往做得又快又好。我们是人民的子弟兵，应该紧紧地和人民群众站在一起，和他们一道挑起抓革命、促生产的重担。
    我一到农村，就向贫下中农宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大意义，和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起参加劳动生产，给贫下中农看病。有一次，听指导员说，宗家洼生产大队发生流行性感冒，当时我饭也没顾上吃，水也没顾上喝，背上药包一气跑到了宗家洼。在村里我挨门逐户给贫下中农看病，向他们宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示。我看了一家又一家，边看病边宣传，直到天黑。第二天，我又背上药包来到宗家洼继续为病人治疗和向群众宣传。许多贫下中农深受感动。贫农社员陈大娘说：“毛主席的恩情，我永远忘不了。我虽然年纪大了，也要分担一份抓革命、促生产的重担。”毛泽东思想指导着我为贫下中农做了一点事，今后，我要永远做革命群众运动的促进派。
    讲用会结束的时候，贫下中农和指战员们一致表示：今后要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，改造思想，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，永远前进，夺取革命、生产双丰收。（附图片）
    紧紧地和无产阶级革命派战斗在一起的人民解放军，时时刻刻不忘伟大统帅毛主席的教导，最坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，在斗争中推动活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动向前发展。图为山西平定县石门口公社西郊生产大队革命委员会委员和当地驻军战士一起学习毛主席著作。　新华社稿
