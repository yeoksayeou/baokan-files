In the "backyard" of U.S. imperialism, Latin America, the broad masses of laboring people are increasingly awakening and rising up to wage a courageous struggle against the American monopolies that ruthlessly exploit them and the reactionary ruling cliques in their own countries.

This year, the waves of mass struggles against exploitation and oppression have swept across many countries in Latin America.

In January, public transport workers in El Salvador launched the first-ever strike in the country's history, demanding wage increases to offset the losses caused by inflation.

In February, 150,000 employees in Uruguay's banking, petroleum, telecommunications, fishing, railway, and postal sectors went on a 72-hour strike to protest price increases and demand that the government pass a budget that includes wage increases. Additionally, 15,000 medical staff in Uruguay's public hospitals and technical personnel at Carrasco Airport in Montevideo also went on strike to demand wage increases.

Since late January, bank employees in Colombia have been on strike, demanding wage increases. Despite government repression, the strike quickly spread to banks across the country. In some places, bank employees went on hunger strikes.

In Argentina's Tucumán Province, due to the reactionary government's measures of closing sugar mills and mass layoffs of striking workers, sugar industry workers held demonstrations in February to protest the dictatorship's shooting of striking workers.

On March 1st, over a million workers from various industries in Argentina began a 24-hour general strike to protest the pro-American dictatorship of Onganía, which implements policies that sell out national interests and harm workers' rights. This strike is a new counterattack by the Argentine working class against Onganía's reactionary policies. On December 14th last year, workers from various industries in Argentina had already held a 24-hour nationwide general strike.

In Chile, agricultural workers at the "Good Hope" farm in Curanilahue have been on strike for a month, refusing to let scabs enter the farm despite police gunfire. In Talca Province, 300 peasants occupied a farm, and their rebellious actions were supported by nearby peasants.

In Paraguay, American monopolies control the slaughtering and refrigeration of Paraguay's main export, beef, and also control Paraguay's oil reserves. They maintain feudal institutions in the countryside, even including serfdom. Seventy percent of peasants have no land. Now, workers, peasants, and people's parties in Paraguay have formed an alliance and organized guerrilla forces to fight against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

    美帝国主义“后院”处处是火山
    拉丁美洲人民反压迫反剥削斗争浪潮汹涌
    本报综合报道　在美帝国主义的“后院”拉丁美洲，广大劳动人民正在日益觉醒，纷纷起来同残酷剥削他们的美国垄断资本和本国反动统治当局进行英勇的斗争。
    今年以来，反对剥削和压迫的群众斗争的浪潮遍及了拉丁美洲的许多国家。
    中美洲萨尔瓦多的公共汽车工人，在一月份发动了这个国家历史上第一次交通工人大罢工，要求提高工资，以弥补通货膨胀给他们带来的损失。
    乌拉圭的银行、石油、电话、渔业、铁路、邮政等部门的职员十五万人，在二月份举行了七十二小时的罢工，抗议物价上涨，要求政府通过包括提高工资待遇规定的预算。乌拉圭公立医院一万五千名医务工作人员以及蒙得维的亚卡拉斯科机场的技术人员为要求增加工资也举行了罢工。
    哥伦比亚银行职工从一月下旬开始罢工，要求增加工资。尽管政府进行迫害，罢工斗争还是迅速扩大到全国各地银行业。有的地方，银行职工进行了绝食斗争。
    在阿根廷的图库曼省，由于反动政府采取封闭糖厂和大批解雇罢工工人等镇压措施，糖业工人在二月间举行示威游行，抗议独裁政权枪杀罢工工人的暴行。
    阿根廷上百万各行业工人本月一日开始举行二十四小时的总罢工，抗议翁加尼亚亲美独裁政权所执行的出卖民族利益和损害工人权益的反动政策。
    这次罢工是阿根廷工人阶级对翁加尼亚政权的反动政策发起的一次新反击。去年十二月十四日，阿根廷各行业工人曾经举行过二十四小时全国总罢工。
    在智利的库拉尼拉乌“好望”农庄的农业工人举行的罢工已经坚持了一个月，他们不顾警察开枪镇压，坚决拒绝让工贼进入庄园破坏罢工。在塔尔卡省，三百名农民占领了一个庄园。他们的造反行动得到附近农民的支持。
    在巴拉圭，美国垄断了巴拉圭主要出口品牛肉的屠宰和冷藏，并且控制了巴拉圭的石油矿藏。它还在农村里保存着封建制度，甚至还有农奴制度。百分之七十的农民没有土地。现在，巴拉圭的工人、农民和人民党派结成了联盟，并且组成了游击队，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行着斗争。
