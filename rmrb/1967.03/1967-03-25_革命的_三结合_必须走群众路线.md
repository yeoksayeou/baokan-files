Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" for seizing power have illuminated the path of the struggle to seize power, greatly inspiring the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. In places and units where power needs to be seized, everyone is enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, actively engaging in the struggle to establish revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organs of the proletariat. However, how to implement the "three-in-one combination"? Should we continue to mobilize the masses, or should a few people take it over? This is a key issue in whether the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can truly be realized.

In the struggle to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," how to correctly identify revolutionary cadres is a very important issue. The fundamental guarantee for correctly identifying cadres is to follow the mass line, trust the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses, implementing the principle of combining leadership with the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us:

"To examine cadres, if it is done only by a few people in the leading organ of the organization department in isolation, it will certainly not be done well. If it is done through the administrative heads of a certain organ or a certain school, mobilizing many people and many students in that organ or school, sometimes even all the people and all the students, while the leading cadres of the higher-level organization department correctly guide this examination, implementing the principle of combining leadership with the masses, the purpose of examining cadres will definitely be fully achieved." The broad revolutionary masses know best about the cadres in their own units and departments. Especially through the struggle to expose and criticize over the past few months of the Cultural Revolution, who are the walking capitalists in power that must be overthrown, who are the cadres that can continue to work, and who are the cadres that can participate in the temporary power organs, the masses have a clear account. The masses' eyes are bright, and their attitude is the most just. They grasp Chairman Mao's cadre policy and will definitely be able to identify the most suitable cadre candidates. Therefore, the process of the "three-in-one combination" should be a process of implementing the principle of combining leadership with the masses, mobilizing the masses, and implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy to further examine and identify cadres.

The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can only be born out of the masses' struggle. Especially for those cadres who have made mistakes, letting them go to the masses to "show their face," further accepting the masses' criticism and help, touching their souls, raising their awareness, and correcting their mistakes, can make them stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line more quickly; it can also make some cadres better gain the trust and support of the masses and participate in the temporary power organs. Therefore, the process of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is also a process of mobilizing the masses, starting from the desire for unity, criticizing or struggling against some cadres who have made mistakes, and achieving new unity on a new basis.

How to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is not only a matter of method but also a major issue involving the struggle between two lines. One is the proletarian revolutionary line, which is to continue to mobilize the masses, trust the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and through a series of mass struggles, produce truly revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organs of the proletariat. Following this line, the mass movement will continue to advance vigorously, pushing the Cultural Revolution to a new high. On the other hand, if a few people close the door to decide the list of the "three-in-one combination," take it over, treat the masses as a puppet, and treat themselves as Zhuge Liang, making the mass movement cold and desolate, this is a manifestation of the bourgeois reactionary line. Such a temporary power organ established will inevitably be a hollow shell high above the masses and will not be able to lead the broad revolutionary masses to complete the task of seizing power victoriously. Doing so may also lead to combining for the sake of combining, emphasizing unity without struggle. In some cases, it may even be exploited by others to engage in centrism, conciliationism, and the merging of two into one, bringing those who insist on errors, do not draw a clear line with the handful of walking capitalists in power within the Party, and do not draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line into the "three-in-one combination." It may even allow the handful of walking capitalists in power within the Party to infiltrate the leadership core. Such a "three-in-one combination" would become a tool for counter-revolutionary restoration and anti-seizure of power. The proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres must be highly vigilant against this.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous." The revolutionary masses have the power to overthrow the handful of walking capitalists in power within the Party, and they are also fully capable of playing a decisive role in establishing a new leadership team. The proletarian revolutionary masses have always been staunch defenders and executors of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the struggle to seize power through the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we must continue to uphold Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without any deviation, implement the principle of combining leadership with the masses, fully mobilize the masses, arm the masses with Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and quickly and gradually unite all cadres and masses that can be united to achieve new victories in seizing power through the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"!

### 革命的“三结合”必须走群众路线

    革命的“三结合”必须走群众路线
    《解放日报》三月十七日社论
    毛主席关于革命的“三结合”联合夺权的最新指示，照亮了夺权斗争的道路，极大地鼓舞了无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众。在需要夺权的地方和单位，大家正热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，积极投入建立革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构的斗争。可是，如何实行“三结合”？是继续发动群众，还是由少数人包办代替，这是革命的“三结合”能不能真正实现的一个关键。
    在实现革命的“三结合”的斗争中，如何正确鉴定革命的领导干部的人选，是一个极其重要的问题；而走群众路线，相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，实行领导和群众相结合的原则，就是正确鉴定干部人选的根本保证。毛主席教导我们：
  “审查干部，如果仅仅由组织部这个领导机关的少数人孤立地去做，必不可能做好；如果通过某一机关或某一学校的行政负责人，推动该机关该学校的许多人员、许多学生，有时甚至是全体人员、全体学生都参加审查，而上级组织部的领导人员则正确地指导这种审查，实行领导和群众相结合的原则，审查干部的目的就一定能完满地达到。”广大革命群众对本单位、本部门的干部最了解，特别是，通过文化大革命几个月来的揭发批判斗争，哪些是必须打倒的走资本主义道路当权派，哪些是可以继续工作的干部，哪些是可以参加临时权力机构的干部，群众肚子里都有一笔账。群众的眼睛是雪亮的，群众的态度是最公正的。他们掌握了毛主席的干部政策，一定能识别出最适合的干部人选。因此，“三结合”的过程，应该是实行领导和群众相结合的原则，放手发动群众，贯彻毛主席的干部政策，进一步审查识别干部的过程。
    革命的“三结合”只能在群众斗争中产生。特别是，对于那些犯了错误的干部，让他们到群众中去“亮相”，进一步接受群众的批评帮助，触及灵魂，提高认识，改正错误，就可以更快地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来；也就能够使某些干部更好地取得群众的信任和支持，参加临时权力机构。因此，革命的“三结合”的过程，又是放手发动群众，从团结的愿望出发，向某些犯错误的领导干部进行批评或斗争，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结的过程。
    怎样实行革命的“三结合”，不仅是一个方法问题，而且是涉及到两条路线斗争的大问题。一条是无产阶级的革命路线，这就是继续放手发动群众，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，通过一系列的群众斗争，产生出真正革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。遵循这条路线，群众运动就会继续轰轰烈烈地前进，把文化大革命推向新的高潮。反之，少数人闭门圈定“三结合”的名单，包办代替，把群众当成阿斗，把自己当成诸葛亮，把群众运动弄得冷冷清清，这就是资产阶级反动路线的表现。这样建立的临时权力机构必将是高高在上、脱离群众的空架子，决不可能率领广大革命群众胜利地完成夺权的战斗任务。这样做，还很可能为结合而结合，只讲团结，不讲斗争，在有些情况下，还会被人乘机搞折中主义、调和主义、合二而一，把那些坚持错误、不同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限、不同资产阶级反动路线划清界限的人拉到“三结合”中来。甚至会使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派混进领导核心，这样的“三结合”就成了反革命复辟、反夺权的工具。无产阶级革命派和革命群众对此必须引起高度的警惕。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。革命群众有力量打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们也完全有力量在建立新的领导班子中起决定性作用，无产阶级革命派从来就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的坚决捍卫者和执行者，在革命的“三结合”联合夺权的斗争中，我们一定要继续坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不折不扣地执行毛主席最新指示，实行领导和群众相结合的原则，充分发动群众，用毛主席的干部政策武装群众，迅速地逐渐地把一切可以团结的干部和群众团结起来，夺取革命的“三结合”联合夺权的新胜利！
