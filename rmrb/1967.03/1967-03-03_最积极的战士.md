The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has nurtured millions of Red Guards, who will forever uphold and maintain the revolutionary tradition. All revolutionaries, patriots, progressive youth, and students around the world warmly welcome and support this Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards. As a Burmese youth, I warmly welcome and support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong.

As a soldier fighting under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, participating in the Cultural Revolution is something that cannot be compared to anything else. We will not be deceived by rumors but will resolutely support your lofty revolution. The Red Guards are the most active fighters in this revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has armed 700 million Chinese people with Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, all kinds of reactionaries have been exposed, and the reactionary dreams of revisionism have been crushed.

This revolution has also armed the forces of national liberation and national democratic revolution. With the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, we will certainly defeat imperialism and reactionaries.

China's Cultural Revolution is courageously shouldering the revolutionary tasks of the world today. Now, internationally, U.S. imperialism is rampantly carrying out aggression while boasting about "peace." U.S. imperialism is even worse than Nazi Hitler. The first socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union, has already deviated from socialism and is on the capitalist road. The Soviet revisionist leadership is actively colluding with U.S. imperialism to sabotage China's Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao has made profound analyses of China's society and the international situation. China's Cultural Revolution is to defend the achievements of the socialist revolution, prevent China from returning to the capitalist road like the Soviet Union, and further strengthen and unite the anti-imperialist revolutionary forces of all countries in the world.

Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Cultural Revolution!

    最积极的战士
    缅甸　貌觉图
    中国无产阶级文化大革命培育了数以百万计的红卫兵，他们将永远维护和保持革命传统。全世界所有的革命者、爱国者、进步青年和学生，衷心欢迎和支持这场文化大革命和红卫兵。作为一个缅甸青年，我衷心欢迎和支持由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    作为一个在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下的战士参加文化大革命，这是什么也无法和它相比的。我们决不会受谰言的欺骗，而要坚决支持你们崇高的革命。红卫兵是这场革命中的最积极的战士。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命用毛泽东思想武装了七亿中国人民。在毛泽东思想的照耀下，形形色色的反动派原形毕露了，同时也扑灭了修正主义的反动梦想。
    这场革命也武装了民族解放力量和民族民主革命力量。有了毛泽东思想这个强大武器，一定能击败帝国主义和反动派。
    中国的文化大革命英勇地肩负了今天世界的革命任务。现在，在国际范围内，美帝国主义正在猖狂地进行侵略，同时又在侈谈“和平”。美帝国主义比纳粹希特勒更坏。世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联已经从社会主义走上了资本主义道路。苏联修正主义领导集团积极同美帝国主义勾结，来破坏中国文化大革命。毛主席对中国社会和国际局势作了精辟的分析。中国的文化大革命是为了保卫社会主义革命的成果，防止中国象苏联那样回到资本主义的道路上去，进一步加强和团结了世界各国的反帝革命力量。
    毛泽东思想必胜！文化大革命必胜！
