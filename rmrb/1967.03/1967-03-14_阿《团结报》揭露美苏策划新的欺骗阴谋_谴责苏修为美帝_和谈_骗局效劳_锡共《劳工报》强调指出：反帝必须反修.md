Albanian "Unity" Newspaper Exposes New Deception Plot by the US and Soviet Union
Condemns Soviet Revisionists Serving the US "Peace Talks" Hoax
Ceylon Communist Party's "Worker" Newspaper Emphasizes: To Oppose Imperialism, One Must Oppose Revisionism

	BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) — The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on March 12 pointing out that the recent statements by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as the intensified attacks by the armed forces of South Vietnam and the counterattacks by the people of the North, are a clear response to the deception plot by the US aggressors in collaboration with the Soviet revisionist clique.

	The commentary pointed out that the US imperialists and the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist leadership, using their notorious two-pronged policy of escalating the war and so-called "peace talks," attempted to force the Vietnamese people to accept their joint plan of domination, but suffered a humiliating failure. This failure has caused great panic in Washington and Moscow. The imperialist and modern revisionist leaders are now plotting new deception schemes against the Vietnamese people. The US imperialists are sparing no effort to mobilize reactionaries from various countries to serve the US in escalating the aggression and applying pressure on the Vietnamese people through various channels.

	The commentary said that the Soviet revisionist leaders, while shedding crocodile tears for the Vietnamese people, continue to apply pressure on them through various channels, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to accept US rule. They are working hard to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, who share a close and sincere brotherly friendship. This friendship is one of the main factors in the Vietnamese people's complete and thorough victory. The commentary pointed out that, contrary to the crazy schemes of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist leaders, the friendship and trust between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples are growing stronger every day.

	According to Xinhua, the Sinhala-language newspaper "Worker" of the Ceylon Communist Party published an article on March 10 exposing the betrayal of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	The article said that the Soviet revisionists are increasingly openly acting as agents of imperialism. Podgorny's visit to the Vatican and Kosygin's visit to Britain aimed to promote the "peace talks" hoax on the Vietnam issue. Both of them have been striving to serve the US's "peace talks" plot in Vietnam. The article emphasized that the only way to resolve the Vietnam issue is for US troops to withdraw from Vietnam first.

	The article exposed the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of the Indonesian revolution to support the fascist ruling clique in Indonesia. The article said: "The modern revisionists are trying to win the favor of reactionaries and imperialists from various countries." "The Soviet leadership has reached an agreement with the Indonesian ruling clique on the supply of weapons."

	The article said: "The modern revisionists led by the Soviet Union are conducting various distortions of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China. Because of the Cultural Revolution, all their hopes of seeing a capitalist restoration in China, similar to what happened in the Soviet Union, have been dashed." The article also said: "The Soviet revisionists have been partners with the US in its plot to encircle China with military bases."

	The article concluded by pointing out that imperialists and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The Soviet revisionists' anti-China attempts are doomed to failure. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible. Their revolutionary friends are all over the world. The Soviet revisionists' further collusion with US and British imperialism and other reactionaries has alerted the true revolutionaries of the world. They understand that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism.

    阿《团结报》揭露美苏策划新的欺骗阴谋
    谴责苏修为美帝“和谈”骗局效劳
    锡共《劳工报》强调指出：反帝必须反修
    新华社地拉那十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十二日发表评论指出，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南民主共和国外交部最近分别发表的声明、越南南方解放武装力量加紧出击以及北方军民的反击，对于美国侵略者在苏联修正主义集团配合下策划的欺骗阴谋，是一个最清楚的回答。
    评论指出，美帝国主义者和苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团用声名狼藉的两手政策——战争升级和所谓的“和谈”，妄图强迫越南人民接受他们统治的共同计划，遭到可耻失败，这一失败在华盛顿和莫斯科引起了巨大的惊慌。帝国主义和现代修正主义头子们正在对越南人民策划新的欺骗阴谋。美帝国主义者为此千方百计地动员各国反动派为美国在侵略升级和通过各种渠道对越南人民施加压力方面效劳。
    评论说，苏联修正主义头目们一边对越南人民流出鳄鱼的眼泪，一边继续通过各种渠道对越南人民施加压力，妄图迫使越南人民接受美国的统治。他们正煞费心机地挑拨中越两国人民亲密的、真诚的兄弟般的友谊，这种友谊是越南人民取得完全和彻底胜利的主要因素之一。评论指出，同苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义头目们的疯狂企图相反，中越两国人民的友谊和信任正在日益加强。
    据新华社科伦坡十二日电　锡兰共产党的僧伽罗文报纸《劳工报》十日发表文章，揭露苏修领导集团叛卖越南人民和全世界革命人民。
    文章说，苏修越来越公开地充当帝国主义的代理人。波德戈尔内访问梵蒂冈和柯西金访问英国的目的，是要在越南问题上推销“和谈”骗局。他们两人都竭力为美国在越南玩弄的“和谈”阴谋效劳。文章强调指出，解决越南问题的唯一办法是：美军必须首先撤出越南。
    文章揭露苏修领导集团出卖印度尼西亚革命，以支持印度尼西亚的法西斯统治集团。文章说：“现代修正主义者竭力想赢得各国反动派和帝国主义的好感”，“苏联领导已经同印度尼西亚统治集团就供应武器问题达成了协议”。
    文章说：“以苏联为首的现代修正主义者对目前在中国开展的无产阶级文化大革命进行各种歪曲宣传。因为由于文化大革命，他们想在中国看到象苏联所发生的那种资本主义复辟的一切希望，全都破灭了。”文章还说：“苏联修正主义者在美国策划用军事基地包围中国方面充当了它的伙伴。”
    文章最后指出，帝国主义者和一切反动派都是纸老虎。苏修的一切反华企图，都是注定要失败的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不可战胜的。他们的革命朋友遍天下。苏修同美英帝国主义和其他反动派的进一步勾结，擦亮了全世界真正的革命者的眼睛。他们懂得，要反对帝国主义，必须反对现代修正主义。
