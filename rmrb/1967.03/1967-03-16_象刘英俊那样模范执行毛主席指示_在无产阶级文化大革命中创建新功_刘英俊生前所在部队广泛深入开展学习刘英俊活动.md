		Learn from Liu Yingjun to Model the Execution of Chairman Mao's Instructions
		Create New Achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
		The Unit Where Liu Yingjun Served Before Widely and Deeply Carries Out the Learning of Liu Yingjun

		According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 15th: At the critical moment when our great leader Chairman Mao calls on the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad leftist masses and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the unit where Liu Yingjun served before has widely and deeply carried out activities to learn from Liu Yingjun. The broad cadres and soldiers are determined to learn from Liu Yingjun, to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the stormy waves of class struggle, to model the execution of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to create new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

		March 15th is the first anniversary of Liu Yingjun's heroic sacrifice for protecting the lives of the people. The broad cadres and soldiers of this unit, in order to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to better support the united power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and to support spring farming production, have generally combined the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reviewed Liu Yingjun's deeds before his death and excerpts from his diary, as well as editorials and articles about Liu Yingjun in newspapers and magazines, and held meetings to share experiences and summarize the gains and experiences of learning from Liu Yingjun over the past year. The unit's leading organs have also specially organized activists who study Chairman Mao's works to give reports in the companies, sharing their experiences of learning from Liu Yingjun as an example, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Each company also uses broadcasting, blackboard newspapers, and slide shows and other propaganda tools to repeatedly publicize Liu Yingjun's deeds, giving the broad cadres and soldiers another profound education. Everyone said: Liu Yingjun has a thousand good points, ten thousand good points, and modeling the execution of Chairman Mao's instructions is the first good point. We learn from Liu Yingjun and must model the execution of Chairman Mao's instructions like him.

		In the activities of learning from Liu Yingjun, the cadres and soldiers follow Chairman Mao's teachings, actively support the united power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses in the local factories and enterprises. They go deep into the workshops, workers' dormitories, and canteens, enthusiastically publicize Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, publicize the Party's policies, guide workers to study Chairman Mao's works, and help workers use Mao Zedong Thought to correctly handle issues in the power seizure struggle. The cadres and soldiers of a certain company's Third Machine Company, based on the actual situation of a certain factory, organized the red rebels of this factory to study Chairman Mao's statements on cadre policy, making everyone realize that cadres who execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are the Party's and the people's precious assets, and only by uniting revolutionary cadres can we seize power well and hold power well. Liu Yingjun once said before his death: "The more people who master Mao Zedong Thought, the more revolutionary strength we have." A certain company's Flame-thrower Company found that a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in a certain factory were spreading the poison of revolutionary economism among the workers, so they immediately organized the workers to study Chairman Mao's statements on opposing economism, making some deceived masses raise their awareness, expose the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and actively participate in the power seizure struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

		During this period, some units also went to the countryside to support spring farming production in the rural people's communes. The cadres and soldiers of the company where Liu Yingjun served before, as soon as they arrived in the countryside, participated in the preparation for farming production with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's works together, and publicized Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and All Levels of Cadres in the Rural People's Communes Across the Country," which was welcomed by the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised: The PLA brought us Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and we must definitely grasp the revolution and promote production. A certain company's Command Company, which has consecutively won the title of "Four Good Company" for five years, also held discussions with the poor and lower-middle peasants on how to learn from Liu Yingjun during the support for spring farming, and the military and civilians unanimously expressed their determination to learn from Liu Yingjun to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp the revolution, promote production, and fight the first battle of spring farming production with the spirit of "seizing the day."

		In supporting the united power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses and supporting spring farming production, the broad cadres and soldiers always take Liu Yingjun as an example, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and break down the "self" in their minds. A certain company's Seventh Company, before going to a certain factory to support the proletarian revolutionary masses in seizing power, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party," and fight against various selfish thoughts, making the cadres and soldiers raise their awareness and strengthen their confidence. After entering the factory, they did everything according to Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly supporting the broad leftist masses, and achieving victory in the power seizure struggle. The soldiers said: Only by breaking down the "self" like Liu Yingjun and modeling the execution of Chairman Mao's instructions can we complete the glorious tasks given to us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The soldiers on the spring farming frontline said: Only by letting the "public" take root in our minds like Liu Yingjun can we be revolutionary pioneers and production models, and make new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

		Today, the broad cadres and soldiers of this unit held a grand meeting to commemorate the first anniversary of Liu Yingjun's sacrifice. They summarized the achievements and experiences of carrying out the learning of Liu Yingjun over the past year. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to forever learn from Liu Yingjun, to strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, to loyally implement Mao Zedong Thought, to enthusiastically publicize Mao Zedong Thought, to bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, and to forever maintain the most red flag of the People's Liberation Army.

    象刘英俊那样模范执行毛主席指示
    在无产阶级文化大革命中创建新功
    刘英俊生前所在部队广泛深入开展学习刘英俊活动
    据新华社哈尔滨十五日电　正当我们最高统帅毛主席号召人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的关键时刻，刘英俊生前所在部队，广泛深入地开展了学习刘英俊同志的活动。广大指战员决心象刘英俊那样，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里活学活用毛主席著作，模范地执行毛主席的最新指示，在无产阶级文化大革命中创建新功。
    三月十五日，是刘英俊同志为保卫人民生命安全光荣牺牲一周年。这个部队的广大指战员为了坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，更好地支持无产阶级革命派的联合夺权斗争和支援春耕生产，普遍结合当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势，重温了刘英俊的生前事迹和日记摘抄，以及报刊上有关刘英俊的社论和文章，并召开讲用会、座谈会，总结交流一年来学习刘英俊的收获和经验。部队领导机关还专门组织学习毛主席著作积极分子，到连队巡回报告在无产阶级文化大革命中，以刘英俊为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，执行毛主席最新指示的体会。各个连队也利用广播、黑板报、幻灯等宣传工具，反复宣传刘英俊的事迹，使广大指战员又一次受到了深刻的教育。大家说：刘英俊有一千个好，一万个好，模范执行毛主席的指示是第一个好。我们学习刘英俊，就要象他那样模范地执行毛主席的指示。
    在学习刘英俊的活动中，指战员们遵循毛主席的教导，积极支持了驻地工厂、企业无产阶级革命派的联合夺权斗争。他们深入车间、职工宿舍和食堂，热情宣传毛主席的革命路线，宣传党的方针政策，辅导工人学习毛主席著作，帮助工人用毛泽东思想来正确处理夺权斗争中的问题。某部三机连的干部战士根据某工厂的实际情况，组织这个厂的红色造反者学习毛主席关于干部政策的论述，使大家认识到，执行毛主席革命路线的领导干部，是党和人民的宝贵财富，只有团结革命领导干部，才能夺好权，掌好权。刘英俊生前说过：“多一个人掌握毛泽东思想，就多一份革命的力量。”某部喷火连发现某工厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在工人中散布反革命经济主义的毒素，就立即组织工人学习毛主席关于反对经济主义的论述，使一些受蒙蔽的群众提高了认识，揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，积极投入了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争。
    这期间，有些部队还开赴农村，支援农村人民公社的春耕生产。刘英俊生前所在连队的指战员，一到农村就和贫下中农一起参加备耕生产，一起学习毛主席著作，向贫下中农宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，受到了广大贫下中农的欢迎。贫下中农赞扬说：解放军给咱们带来了毛主席的最新指示，我们一定要大抓革命，猛促生产。连续五年获得四好连队称号的某部指挥连，在支援春耕中，还同贫下中农一起座谈怎样向刘英俊学习，军民一致表示要象刘英俊那样活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，以“只争朝夕”的精神打好春耕生产第一仗。
    广大指战员在支持无产阶级革命派联合夺权的斗争和支援春耕生产中，处处以刘英俊为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，大破自己头脑里的“私”字。某部七连在去某工厂支援无产阶级革命派夺权前，组织大家学习毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，同各种私心杂念作斗争，使指战员们提高了认识，增强了信心。进厂以后，他们又事事按照毛主席的教导办事，坚决支持左派广大群众，取得了夺权斗争的胜利。战士们说：只有象刘英俊那样革“私”字的命，做毛主席指示的模范执行者，才能完成党中央和毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。在春耕第一线的战士们说：只有象刘英俊那样，让“公”字在头脑里扎根，革命才能当闯将，生产才能当模范，在无产阶级文化大革命中作出新的贡献。
    今天这支部队广大指战员隆重集会，纪念刘英俊同志牺牲一周年，他们总结了一年来开展向刘英俊同志学习活动的成绩和经验。大家一致表示，要永远象刘英俊那样，努力学习毛泽东思想，忠实贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，永远保持人民解放军最鲜红的旗帜。
