The most resounding song is "The East Is Red," and the greatest leader is Mao Zedong. A three-meter-high giant statue of Chairman Mao stands majestically in the main hall of the art and craft factory on Zhonghua Road in the center of Guiyang City. The news of the birth of the giant statue of Chairman Mao spread like a spring breeze, immediately reaching every corner of the city, becoming a great joy for the entire city. In recent days, revolutionary masses from all over the city, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have been streaming here, gathering in front of Chairman Mao's statue, gazing up happily, and spontaneously shouting: Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, forever and ever!

This golden statue of Chairman Mao is created by the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Guiyang Art and Craft Factory, with their profound class feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They resolutely fought against the capitalist-roaders within the party, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally created it.

Under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the Guiyang Art and Craft Factory had, for more than eight years, been producing mostly artifacts of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, and rarely made plaster statues of Chairman Mao that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers yearned for. In the first half of 1965, these capitalist-roaders, under the pretext of "technical" difficulties, ordered the factory to stop making plaster statues of Chairman Mao. The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rose high! The proletarian revolutionary faction in the factory rose up in rebellion, seized power from them, and quickly resumed the production of plaster statues of Chairman Mao. They decided to create a three-meter-high giant statue of Chairman Mao.

To create a giant statue, there were many difficulties: no model, no experience, plus poor equipment, and insufficient manpower and resources.

At the beginning of the trial production, a bureaucrat from the provincial authority came out to obstruct. He put on an air of superiority, saying, "This way won't work. Don't be greedy. Only Shanghai and Shenyang can replicate statues." A few capitalist-roaders within the party in the factory parroted, "We lack manpower and resources. Let's not do this recklessly." These bourgeois bosses faithfully carried out the reactionary revisionist literary line of the Zhou Yang clique, making every effort to obstruct the praise of our great leader Chairman Mao and the propaganda of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. However, it is easy to shake the mountains, but it is difficult to shake the red hearts of the proletarian revolutionary faction who have boundless love for Chairman Mao! The revolutionary workers did not listen to them. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings in "Quelling the Mountains": "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, we shall strive for victory." They were determined to create the giant statue of Chairman Mao in this small factory with poor equipment.

However, the struggle did not end there. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, in order to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and sabotage the creation of Chairman Mao's statue, incited workers in the factory to go out and make connections. The proletarian revolutionary faction in the factory saw through the enemy's tricks at a glance. They resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call, seized the revolution, and promoted production. The enemy's tricks failed.

To create the giant statue more quickly, many revolutionary workers in the factory volunteered to complete this glorious task. During the trial production, revolutionary workers worked day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep. They said, "This is a glorious and happy task. We would rather not eat or sleep, but we must create the giant statue." They finally overcame the difficulties in materials, equipment, and technology, and successfully produced six giant statues of Chairman Mao that met all the specifications.

Not long ago, revolutionary workers in the factory put one of the giant statues of Chairman Mao on a cart, beating drums and gongs, to report the good news to the Guizhou Provincial Military Region and presented the statue to the Provincial Military Region.

The birth of the three-meter-high giant statue of Chairman Mao is a testament to the revolutionary workers' boundless love, faith, loyalty, and adoration for our great leader Chairman Mao. They firmly declared: They will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought for life, firmly grasp the power to create statues of Chairman Mao, create statues of Chairman Mao for life, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought for life.

    毛主席大型全身塑像诞生记
    最响亮的歌是东方红，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。
    一座三米高的毛主席大型全身塑像，巍然屹立在贵阳市中心中华路一家工艺美术厂门市部的正厅里。毛主席大型塑像诞生的消息，象春风一样，立即传遍了全城，成为全城的一件大喜事。连日来，广大革命群众满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，川流不息地来到这里，围在毛主席像前，无限幸福地仰望着，情不自禁地欢呼：我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    这座金色的毛主席大型塑像，是贵阳市工艺美术厂的无产阶级革命派，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，坚决同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行斗争，克服重重困难后制作出来的。
    贵阳市工艺美术厂在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的把持下，八年多以来，生产的多是一些帝王将相、才子佳人之类的工艺品，很少制作出广大工农兵群众所渴望的毛主席石膏像。一九六五年上半年，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，借口所谓“技术”过不了关，竟然下令这个厂停止制作毛主席石膏像。无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火燃烧起来了！厂里的无产阶级革命派揭竿而起，造了他们的反，夺了他们的权，很快恢复了毛主席石膏塑像的制作，并且决定制作三米高的毛主席大型全身塑像。
    要制作大型塑像，困难不少，一没有模型，二没有经验，加上设备简陋，人力物力都不足。
    刚开始试制，省里主管部门一个家伙又出来横加阻挠。他摆起一副老爷架势，说什么“这样搞不行，不要贪大。复制塑像只有上海、沈阳才行。”厂里一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派也鹦鹉学舌地说：“我们人力物力都缺乏，还是不要乱搞。”这些资产阶级老爷们忠实地执行周扬一伙反革命修正主义的文艺路线，对歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席、宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，百般刁难，恨之入骨。但是，撼山易，撼无产阶级革命派对毛主席无限热爱的红心难！革命派职工不听那一套，他们学习了毛主席在《愚公移山》这篇著作中的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一定要在这个设备简陋的小厂里，把毛主席大型塑像制作出来。
    然而斗争并没有结束。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了抵制毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，破坏毛主席塑像的制作，竟又煽动厂里工人出外串连。厂里的无产阶级革命派一眼看穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，他们最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产。敌人的阴谋诡计失败了。
    为了把大型塑像更快地制作出来，这个厂的许多革命职工，都自告奋勇地去完成这一光荣的任务。在试作过程中，革命派职工夜以继日，废寝忘食地工作。他们说，这是一项光荣而幸福的工作，我们宁可不吃饭，不睡觉，也要把大型塑像制作出来。他们终于克服了材料、设备和技术上的一些困难，成功地制出六座完全合乎规格的毛主席大型塑像。
    前不久，厂里革命职工把一座毛主席大型塑像装在车子上推着，敲锣打鼓地到贵州省军区报喜，并将塑像赠送给省军区。
    三米高的毛主席大型塑像的诞生，就凭的是革命职工对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜的红心。他们坚定地表示：要一辈子高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把制作毛主席像的大权牢牢地掌握在手，制作一辈子毛主席像，宣传一辈子毛泽东思想。　新华社记者
