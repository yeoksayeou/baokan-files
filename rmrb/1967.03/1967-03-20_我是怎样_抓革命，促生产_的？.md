In the stormy struggle of the masses, I underwent a test

The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great revolution that touches people's souls and is a major issue concerning the eternal color of our country. At the end of last year, the "Draft Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Rural Areas" was issued. The commune held a meeting to deploy the rural cultural revolution, which I found very sudden and did not understand at first. Moreover, in my mind, it was "fear" that came first. I was afraid of the masses, afraid of the Red Guards. I was afraid the masses would seize my weaknesses, afraid it would disrupt the production plan, afraid I would fail to complete the production tasks, afraid of being criticized, afraid of losing my authority, and afraid that later on, no one would listen to me. In short, it was "self" that came first, and I could not put down my arrogance. At the meeting held by the commune on December 27 and 28, we studied the "Sixteen Points" and the "Ten Points." The third point of the "Sixteen Points" especially emphasizes "daring" to lead the masses, pointing out that daring or not daring to lead the masses will determine the fate of this proletarian cultural revolution. I thought, "The 'Sixteen Points' were personally presided over by Chairman Mao, so following them cannot be wrong." In the brigade, am I a cadre of the proletariat or a cadre of the bourgeoisie? The revolutionary masses are clear about this. I was afraid of the masses and the Red Guards, which meant I was afraid of the revolution. Therefore, I decided to return to the brigade, mobilize the masses, and let the fire burn myself, burning away my shortcomings and mistakes. That very night, I convened a meeting of the community members to deploy the cultural revolution and propagate the "Ten Points" and the "Sixteen Points." At the meeting, I said: "I have been a cadre for more than ten years and must have many shortcomings and mistakes. I ask everyone to boldly point out my shortcomings and post big-character posters about me. Criticizing me is for the sake of doing a better job in the future."

On January 1, 1967, the revolutionary faction of the brigade announced the convening of a criticism meeting. I heard that I was to be criticized and felt a bit afraid again. At this time, I opened the precious book written by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: "We Communists should face the wind and rain and see the world; this wind and rain is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great arena of the masses' struggle." Chairman Mao also said: "You should put politics in command, go among the masses, and work with the masses to make the proletarian cultural revolution even better." Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions pointed out the direction for me. I thought: A Communist should roll in the waves of class struggle thousands of times and undergo great tests and examinations in the great arena of the masses' struggle, treating oneself as both the object and the force of the revolution, in order to touch one's soul, cut off the "self," and ensure that one's thoughts do not slip into the wrong path, forever advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. After studying and struggling with my thoughts, I felt much clearer and decided to stand out, handing myself over to the masses for criticism and examination. There was no venue for the meeting, so I actively discussed with the masses to use the clubhouse as the venue and helped with the arrangements. Before the meeting, I actively convened the masses to participate in the meeting. When asked who was to be criticized, I said: "It is me."

One thought problem was solved, and a new one arose. At the meeting, the masses did not spare any feelings and seriously exposed and criticized my shortcomings and mistakes. Some opinions were raised very sharply. I thought: "I have been a cadre for more than ten years, working hard day and night, and now I have to endure such criticism!" I felt very wronged. Just at this moment, I remembered Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism if we have shortcomings. No matter who points out our shortcomings, as long as you are right, we will correct them. If your method is good for the people, we will follow it." Chairman Mao's instructions pushed me to launch a struggle in my thoughts and made me realize: The masses could raise so many opinions about me, which showed that there were problems in my work. Thinking further, the revolutionary masses' opinions indeed hit the mark. Thinking of this, my thoughts opened up. Since there were shortcomings and mistakes in my work, correcting them for the benefit of the people was not better? Thus, the feeling of being wronged was resolved.

To fully implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp the revolution and promote production"

Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao calls on us: "Grasp the revolution and promote production." We must not only verbally support it one hundred percent but also turn it into action one hundred percent. Our brigade was a backward brigade before 1965, mainly because the leading cadres were not united. Later, some cadres were changed, and we focused on studying Chairman Mao's works, which greatly changed the spirit of the masses, and we achieved increased production for two consecutive years. We wanted to make a big effort in 1967 to ensure the double victory of revolution and production. However, I was afraid that everyone would not support it. At this time, I remembered Chairman Mao's instructions: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, I discussed with the brigade leader and convened a meeting of militia cadres, poor peasants' association representatives, and revolutionary faction representatives to study how our brigade could grasp the revolution and promote production. Everyone said: "Grasp the revolution and promote production is Chairman Mao's great instruction, we must firmly carry it out and definitely make the 1967 production even better." After everyone's joint research, we formulated four major annihilation battle measures to ensure increased production: building flood prevention dikes, accumulating fertilizer, transforming low-yield fields, and repairing channels. As the party branch secretary, although the revolutionary masses criticized me, they were not going to overthrow me. The tasks assigned by the Party must be completed. The preparation tasks were urgent and had to be done by seizing every minute. If I did not lead the production well, missed the season, and reduced the yield, I would not be able to face Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, I decided to lead the masses to make revolution at night and work on production during the day. I used the opportunity of the criticism meeting before it dispersed to arrange the next day's production. When I did this for the first time, someone stood up and shouted: "We will not listen to you!" But the militia commander, militia platoon leader, and others stood up to support me, saying: "We can expose and criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the party branch secretary, but he is still the branch secretary now, and his arrangement for production is correct, we should listen to him." As a result, the majority of the masses agreed with their opinion. The day after the criticism meeting, all 250-plus laborers in the brigade went to work, and the mass movement to "grasp the revolution and promote production" was carried out vigorously.

At the end of the lunar year, I personally led the masses to block a flood culvert, which was washed away by the water. Just at this time, the revolutionary faction announced another meeting to criticize me. I thought this time the masses would not let me off. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "All our working cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" I thought to myself, the culvert being washed away showed that I made the mistake of underestimating the situation. Facing the mistake, being afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind was not listening to Chairman Mao's words and not believing in the masses. Therefore, at the meeting, I first made a self-criticism, and the result was that the masses encouraged me, saying: "Your self-criticism is good, we do not blame you, this time we failed, do not be discouraged, let's do it again tomorrow." I used the end of this meeting to arrange production. The next day, the militia commander led more than 30 core militia members to block the culvert in the cold wind, and I, along with the brigade leader and the poor peasants' association chairman, also worked with the militia. After working hard for two days, we finally completed the task.

On the first day of the lunar New Year, the revolutionary faction announced the third meeting to criticize me. At that time, I thought of Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp the revolution and promote production" and decided to thoroughly revolutionize myself and arrange production at the meeting. During the day, I and the brigade leader hurried to the fields to check the water conservancy projects and fertilizer accumulation, preparing to speak at the meeting that night. At this meeting, I seriously examined my mistakes and shortcomings and finally arranged the production work. Many revolutionary faction members said to me: "Your recent performance is good, your attitude is sincere, and your work is good, we will not criticize you anymore." I repeatedly said: "No, I have many shortcomings and mistakes, I hope everyone will continue to help me dig them out."

In this way, from January 1, 1967, the revolutionary faction of the brigade organized three criticism meetings against me. With the attitude of daring to revolutionize myself and daring to grasp production, I fought hard against selfishness and grasped production, using the three criticism meetings to arrange production, guiding the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses in the cultural revolution to spring plowing and production, resulting in the initial victory of revolution and production, correcting my mistakes, and gaining the trust of the masses. The revolutionary masses have a correct judgment of cadres. They said well: "If you do it right, we will support you, if you do it wrong, we will criticize and oppose you, we are not just blindly opposing."

Believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and work together to promote production

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will unite to do it.... Once the masses are united, everything will be easy."

Our brigade has been engaged in intensive pre-production since the end of last year, with an attendance rate of over 95%. I, along with the brigade leader, militia commander, and poor peasants' association chairman, participated in cultural revolution activities at night and worked with the masses during the day, never absent. We cadres took the lead in grasping the revolution and promoting production with our actions, and the masses' work enthusiasm was greater, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, fighting continuously, and all completing or overfulfilling the labor quota. By the end of February, the pre-production tasks of the entire brigade were basically completed.

Firmly following Chairman Mao's instructions is correct

Why was I able to stand out and grasp production after being criticized by the masses? In a word, it is to always remember Chairman Mao's instructions, always and in everything think of Chairman Mao's instructions, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions word for word; when praised, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and when criticized, also act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The facts have proven that acting according to Chairman Mao's words is correct. I am not good at studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and often encounter problems, the "self" will jump out. In the future, I will study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, further implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasp the revolution and promote production" and "save money to make revolution," fight together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and militia groups, be vigilant against the sabotage activities of a handful of malicious elements and ghosts and snakes, and resolutely and thoroughly overthrow the handful of cadres within the Party who take the capitalist road, seizing the double victory of revolution and production.

    我是怎样“抓革命，促生产”的？
    闽侯县祥谦公社山前大队党支部书记、民兵营教导员　郭富淦
    在群众斗争的  大风雨中经受考验
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，是关系到我们国家永不变色的大问题。去年年底，《中共中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的指示（草案）》发下来了，公社开会布置农村文化大革命，我感到很突然，一时很不理解，而且，在头脑里是“怕”字当头，怕群众，怕红卫兵。怕群众抓住我的辫子不放，怕打乱生产计划，怕完不成生产任务，怕受批评，降低了威信，以后说话没人听。总之，是“私”字当头，臭架子放不下。在十二月二十七日、二十八日公社召开的会议上，我们学习了“十六条”和“十条”。“十六条”的第三条特别强调“敢”字当头，放手发动群众，指出敢不敢放手发动群众，将决定这场无产阶级文化大革命的命运。我想，“十六条”是毛主席亲自主持制定的，照着办没有错。在大队里我是当权派，是无产阶级当权派，还是资产阶级当权派，革命群众是清楚的。我怕群众，怕红卫兵，就是怕革命。所以，我决心回到大队去，发动群众，引火烧身，烧掉自己的缺点、错误。回去的当天晚上，就召开社员大会，布置文化大革命，宣传“十条”和“十六条”。我在大会上说：“我当了十几年的干部，肯定有很多缺点错误，要求大家大胆向我提意见，贴我的大字报。大家批判我，也是为了把今后工作做得更好。”
    今年一月一日，大队革命派宣布召开批判大会，我听说要批判我，心里又有点怕。这时，我打开毛主席写的宝书，毛主席说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”毛主席还说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”毛主席亲切的教导，给我指出了方向。我想：一个共产党员，应当在阶级斗争风浪里翻滚千百次，应当在群众斗争这个大世面中大考验、大审查几个回合，既把自己当作革命的对象，又把自己当作革命的一份力量，才能触及自己的灵魂，向“私”字开刀，思想才能不向邪路滑，永远沿着毛主席指引的道路前进。经过学习和思想斗争，心里亮堂多了，决心站出来，把自己交给群众批判、审查。开大会没有会场，我就主动地和群众商量，把俱乐部做会场，并帮助布置好。在开会之前，我主动召集群众参加大会，群众问我批判谁，我说：“就是批判我。”
    一个思想问题解决了，新的思想问题又来了。在大会上，群众不讲情面，对我的缺点、错误，进行严肃地揭发、批判，有的意见提得很尖锐。我听了就想：
  “当干部十几年，起早摸黑，辛辛苦苦，还要挨这样的批评！”心里感到很委屈。就在这时我又想起毛主席亲切的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”毛主席的这一教导，推动我展开一场思想斗争，并使我认识到：群众会对我提出那么多意见，这说明我在工作中有问题。再一想，革命群众提的意见，有不少确实打中了自己的灵魂。想到这里，思想开了窍。工作既然有缺点、错误，为了人民群众的利益改正缺点、错误，不是更好吗？这样，委屈情绪就解决了。
      要百分之百地执行毛主席“抓革命，
  促生产”的指示
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席号召我们：“抓革命，促生产”。我们不但在口头上要百分之百地拥护，而且要百分之百地把它变成行动。我们大队一九六五年以前是个后进队，主要原因是领导干部不团结；后来干部有些变动，大抓学习毛主席著作，群众的精神面貌有了很大转变，连续两年增产。我们想在一九六七年大干一番，保证革命、生产双胜利。但是自己又怕大家不支持。这时候，我想起毛主席的教导：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”按照毛主席这个指示，我和大队长商量了一下，召开了民兵干部、贫协代表、革命派代表会议，研究我们大队怎样抓革命，促生产。大家说：“抓革命，促生产，是毛主席的伟大指示，我们一定要坚决贯彻执行，一定要把一九六七年的生产搞得更好。经过大家共同研究，订出了保证增产的四大歼灭战的措施：修建防洪堤，大积肥料，改造低产田，改修渠道。我是党支部书记，虽然革命群众批判我，但并不是要把我打倒。党交给的任务一定要完成。备耕任务很急，必须争分夺秒地去干。我如果领导不好生产，耽误了季节，减了产，就对不住毛主席，对不住贫下中农。因此，我决心领导群众晚上闹革命，白天搞生产。我利用群众批判我的大会未散之前，布置第二天的生产。当我第一次这样做时，曾有人站出来喊：“我们不听你的！”而民兵队长、民兵排长等站起来支持我，他们说：“对党支部书记的缺点错误，可以揭发批判，但他现在还是支部书记，他布置生产是对的，我们应当听。”结果多数群众同意他们的意见。批判会的第二天，全大队二百五十多个劳力全部出工，“抓革命，促生产”的群众运动开展得轰轰烈烈。
    旧历年底，我亲自带领群众搞的堵洪涵洞，被大水冲垮了。正好这时革命派又宣布召开大会批判我，我想这一回群众不会饶我了。这时我学习了毛主席这段教导：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”我心里想，涵洞被冲垮，正是说明我犯了估计不足的错误。在错误面前，前怕狼，后怕虎，就是不听毛主席的话，就是不相信群众。所以，我在大会上首先作了检讨，结果群众反而鼓励我，说：“你检讨得还好，我们不怪你了，这次失败了，不要灰心，明天再干。”我又利用这次大会的结尾布置了生产。第二天，民兵队长带了三十多个基干民兵，冒着冷风刺骨的天气，去堵涵洞，我和大队长、贫协主任等也同民兵一起干，苦干两天，终于完成了任务。
    旧历正月初一，革命派又第三次宣布召开批判我的大会。当时我一想毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，决心好好革自己的命，同时在大会上再次安排生产。白天我和大队长抓紧时间到田间看水利工程和积肥的情况，准备晚上在大会上讲安排意见。在这次大会上，我认真检查了自己的错误和缺点，最后布置了生产工作。许多革命派群众对我说：“你这一段表现不错，态度老实，工作干得很好，不再批判你了。”我再三说：“不行，我的缺点、错误很多，希望大家再继续帮助我挖挖根子。”
    就这样，从今年元月一日开始，大队革命派组织共开了三次批判我的大会，我抱着既大胆革自己的命，又大胆抓生产的态度，狠斗私心，狠抓生产，并利用三次批判会的时机，布置生产，把群众在文化大革命中激发起来的革命干劲，引导到春耕生产上去，结果取得了革命、生产的初步胜利，自己也改正了错误，取得了群众信任。革命群众对干部是有正确判断的。他们说得好：“你干对了我们就支持，干错了我们就批评反对，我们并不是瞎反一气的。”
    相信群众，依靠群众，齐心协力促生产
    毛主席教导我们：“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。……群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。”
    我们大队从去年底就投入了紧张的备耕生产，出工率达百分之九十五以上。我和大队长、民兵队长、贫协主任，晚上参加文化革命活动，白天和群众一起劳动，从不缺勤。我们干部以实际行动带头抓革命，促生产，群众的劳动劲头更大，不怕苦，不怕累，连续作战，都完成或超额完成了劳动定额。到二月底为止，全大队的备耕任务就基本完成了。
    坚决照毛主席的指示办事就对了
    我为什么在群众批评以后，能够挺身而出抓生产呢？千条万条，根本一条就是念念不忘毛主席的教导，时时、事事想到毛主席的指示，一字一句地照毛主席指示办事，毛主席叫我怎么干，我就怎么干；受到表扬的时候照毛主席的指示去做，受到批判的时候，也照毛主席的指示去做。事实证明，凡事都照毛主席的话办就对了。我活学活用毛主席著作还不够，往往遇到问题，“私”字还会跳出来。今后我要更刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，进一步贯彻毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”、“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，同贫下中农、民兵群众战斗在一起，警惕一小撮别有用心的坏家伙和牛鬼蛇神的阴谋破坏活动，坚决地、彻底地打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，夺取革命和生产双胜利。
