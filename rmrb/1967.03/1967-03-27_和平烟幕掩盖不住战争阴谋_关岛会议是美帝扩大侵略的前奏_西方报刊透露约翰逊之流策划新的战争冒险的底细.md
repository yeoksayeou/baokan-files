Johnson personally chaired a meeting on Guam to escalate the war and plot to push the Vietnam War to a new stage. After the meeting ended, some bourgeois newspapers in the United States and other Western countries revealed that this meeting would be a prelude to further escalation of the Vietnam War.

The March 27 issue of the U.S. magazine *Newsweek* reported: "The main task of the Guam meeting was to discuss in detail the U.S. strategy. Despite the Pentagon's denial, reliable sources say that General Westmoreland, the commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, hopes to obtain more troops. In addition to the current plan of 475,000 troops for 1967, perhaps another 100,000 will be added." The magazine pointed out that Johnson's "will to advance military efforts is clear," and he believes that "military pressure must be strengthened."

French bourgeois newspapers also reported: "The first result of the Guam meeting is to further strengthen military actions in Vietnam" (*Le Monde*). This meeting is "a prelude to greatly strengthening war actions" (*Combat*). *Le Figaro* revealed that after the Guam meeting, "the war will enter a new stage. Westmoreland, in order to exert the additional pressure that Johnson hopes he will exert on the enemy, has clearly stated that he needs new reinforcements. Johnson has promised to meet his demands."

To downplay the explosive nature of this meeting and cover up the U.S. escalation of the war, the U.S. government and its propaganda machine tried to portray this meeting as a routine one, as if the issue of war escalation was not discussed. However, this deception is transparent. Johnson's advisor, Lipmann, wrote in the March 22 issue of the *New York Herald Tribune*: "Johnson himself probably knows that he has been making warlike speeches all along, and therefore he must do something to maintain the balance and preserve his reputation as a peace-loving person. Therefore, the public image of the Guam meeting has changed. Newspapers were instructed to tell the public that the meeting would discuss pacification and peace issues." Lipmann admitted, "For those who remember past history, this new image of peace is not convincing." This "peace" rhetoric is "ominous, because... according to this method that has become common since 1965, peace postures are always a prelude to war escalation."

The U.S. imperialism, which is walking further and further down the dangerous road of escalating the Vietnam War, obviously wants to plot new, more reckless war adventures to save itself from impending doom. However, some Western newspapers, when foreseeing the prospect of expanding the war of aggression, could not help but reveal a strong sense of pessimism. For example, an Associated Press report said, "In the face of a difficult year ahead," Johnson will have to "examine achievements and failures," and at that time, he will find "too many unfavorable factors to make him feel happy."

The *Financial Times* of London reported on March 22: When Johnson and his senior advisors returned to Washington yesterday, their minds were filled with "great difficulties." On the same day, the *Daily Telegraph* of London, in reporting the end of the Guam meeting, used the headline: "Johnson's Problems in Vietnam Are 'Painful,' No Answers Found in Guam."

### 和平烟幕掩盖不住战争阴谋  关岛会议是美帝扩大侵略的前奏  西方报刊透露约翰逊之流策划新的战争冒险的底细

    和平烟幕掩盖不住战争阴谋
    关岛会议是美帝扩大侵略的前奏
    西方报刊透露约翰逊之流策划新的战争冒险的底细
    新华社二十三日讯　约翰逊亲自主持召开的大搞战争“升级”、阴谋把侵越战争推向新阶段的关岛黑会收场后，美国和其他西方国家的一些资产阶级报刊纷纷透露，这次会议将是侵越战争进一步升级的“前奏”。
    提前出版的二十七日一期的美国《新闻周刊》报道说：“关岛（会议）的主要任务是详细地讨论美国的战略”，“尽管五角大楼矢口否认，但是据可靠消息说，（侵越美军司令）威斯特摩兰将军希望得到更多的部队，除了目前计划的一九六七年的四十七万五千人以外，也许再增加十万人”。杂志指出，约翰逊“要推进军事努力的意志是明显的”，他相信，必须“加强军事压力”。
    法国的资产阶级报纸也报道说：“关岛会议的第一个结果是进一步加强在越南的军事行动”（《民族报》），这次会议“是大大加强战争行动的前奏”（《战斗报》）。《费加罗报》透露，在关岛会议之后，“战争将进入一个新阶段，威斯特摩兰为了对敌人施加约翰逊指望他施加的额外压力，已经清楚地表示他需要得到新的增援。约翰逊已保证满足他的要求。”
    为了冲淡这次会议的火药味、掩护美国扩大战争，美国官方和它的宣传机器力图把这次会议说成是一次“例行”性质的会议，似乎没有怎么讨论战争“升级”的问题。但是，这种掩耳盗铃的手法是骗不了人的。美国统治集团的谋士李普曼在二十二日的《纽约先驱论坛报》上写道：约翰逊本人“大概也知道，他一直在发表好战的演说，因而他必须做一些事情来保持平衡，并维持他作为一个渴望和平的人的名声。因此关岛会议的公开形象改变了。报纸接到通知，要它们告诉公众，会议将讨论绥靖和和平问题”。李普曼承认，“对那些记得过去的历史的人来说，这种新的和平的形象是不能令人信服的”。这种“和平”言词是“不祥的，因为……根据这种一九六五年以来司空见惯的手法，关于和平的姿态总是战争升级的前奏”。
    在侵越战争逐步升级的危险道路上越走越远的美帝国主义，显然要想通过策划新的、更疯狂的战争冒险来挽救它的灭顶之灾；但是，一些西方报刊在展望扩大侵略战争的前景时都不禁流露出浓厚的悲观情绪。例如，美联社的一则报道就说，“在今后面临困难的一年的前景下”，约翰逊将要“检查成绩和失败的情况”，届时，他会发觉“不利的因素太多了，使他无法感到高兴”。
    伦敦《金融时报》二十二日报道说：当约翰逊和他的高级顾问们昨天返回华盛顿时，他们满脑子装的是“巨大的困难”。同一天，伦敦的《每日电讯报》在报道关岛会议结束的消息时，用的标题是：《约翰逊在越南的问题是“令人痛苦的”，在关岛未求得答案》。
