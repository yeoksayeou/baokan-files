I, on behalf of the Chinese people, strongly protest to the Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The World Federation of Democratic Youth has degenerated into a tool of Soviet revisionists to oppose China.

The New China News Agency reported on the 6th that Jia Xueqian, Vice Secretary-General of the All-China Youth Federation and representative of China to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, today issued a statement strongly protesting the Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Mékine, for his mad attacks and slanders against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chinese youth organizations in a press conference held on February 21.

Jia Xueqian pointed out that after Mékine's mad anti-China activities, the official mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionists, Tass, immediately relayed this news. This is another extremely serious anti-China incident fabricated by the Soviet revisionist leadership in manipulating the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The facts once again prove that the World Federation of Democratic Youth has completely degenerated into a tool for promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The statement said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "To be attacked by the enemy is not a bad thing but a good thing." The more you attack our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the more it proves that we are right and doing well. Jia Xueqian sternly warned Mékine: opposing China will have no good outcome. Mékine must immediately retract his anti-China clamor, publicly apologize to Chinese youth and youth around the world. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this will be the sole responsibility of Mékine.

    我代表向世界青联主席提出强烈抗议
    世界青联已堕落成为苏修反华工具
    新华社六日讯　中华全国青年联合会副秘书长、中国驻世界民主青年联盟代表贾学谦今天发表谈话，强烈抗议世界民主青年联盟主席梅基尼在二月二十一日举行的记者招待会上疯狂攻击和污蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命和中国青年组织。
    贾学谦指出，在梅基尼进行疯狂反华活动后，苏修官方喉舌——塔斯社立即转发了这个消息，这是苏修领导集团操纵世界民主青年联盟制造的又一次极为严重的反华事件。事实再一次证明，世界民主青年联盟已完全堕落成为推行苏修领导集团反革命修正主义路线的工具。
    谈话中说，毛主席教导我们说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”，你们越是攻击我国的无产阶级文化大革命，越是证明我们干得对，干得好。贾学谦严正警告梅基尼：反华是没有好下场的。梅基尼必须立即收回他的反华叫嚣，公开向中国青年和全世界青年低头认罪。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，将由梅基尼本人负完全责任。
