The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission official spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters and strongly condemned the Indonesian government for sabotaging our fourth repatriation mission. This official pointed out that our repatriation ships, due to the Indonesian government's obstruction and harassment, have not yet set sail. The Indonesian government must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission official strongly condemned the Indonesian reactionary government for consistently sabotaging and obstructing our repatriation work. During our repatriation of the persecuted overseas Chinese, the Indonesian government intensified its anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, further cruelly persecuting the overseas Chinese.

The official said that the Indonesian reactionaries had continuously disrupted our three previous repatriation missions to Medan, but all attempts failed miserably. When our repatriation ships were preparing for the fourth trip to Medan, they unreasonably restricted the number of our ship's crew members who could obtain visas, deliberately harassing us. Although we have made multiple protests, the Indonesian side has yet to remove these unreasonable restrictions, affecting our repatriation ship's inability to sail.

The official pointed out that the Chinese government's dispatch of ships to Medan, Indonesia, to repatriate willing overseas Chinese victims is the result of long-term struggles between the Chinese and Indonesian governments. The Indonesian government, in a position of weakness, had to agree to the Chinese government's reasonable request. Each batch of victims repatriated by the Chinese government has exposed the Indonesian government's brutal persecution of overseas Chinese. The Indonesian government, which is crazily conducting anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, has been strongly condemned by international public opinion, making it infamous and embarrassed. Therefore, the Indonesian government is extremely unwilling to let China smoothly carry out repatriation work and is trying every means to obstruct it.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission official, when discussing the tricks used by the Indonesian government in its previous obstructions of our repatriation work, pointed out that the Indonesian government had tried to obstruct Chinese consular officials from going to Medan to handle repatriation matters, attempting to unilaterally arrange our repatriation work. At the same time, the Indonesian government and the Medan reactionary authorities had unreasonably arrested and tortured 41 of our overseas Chinese youth, organized mobs to crazily attack the concentration camp in Medan where the refugees were held, and attacked and destroyed the Chinese Consulate in Medan. These tricks they used in the past are exactly the exposure of their ugly faces. Now, the Indonesian government is unreasonably restricting the number of our repatriation ship's crew members who can land, attempting to obstruct and sabotage our repatriation work by restricting the necessary personnel to land and arrange the repatriation work. The official emphasized that our repatriation ship has not been able to sail due to the Indonesian government's obstruction, and the Indonesian government must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this.

The official emphasized that the Chinese government has repeatedly protested to the Indonesian government, demanding that it respect international norms, abide by relevant treaties and agreements between the two countries, and immediately stop persecuting overseas Chinese. However, the Indonesian government not only did not stop its persecution of overseas Chinese but also used the opportunity of our repatriation to expel overseas Chinese even more intensely. The official said that last September, when China began repatriation, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry notified us that there were 4,500 victims driven from the Aceh region to the Medan concentration camp. Our repatriation ships have made three trips to Medan and have repatriated 3,158 people. Logically, the fourth trip should basically complete the repatriation of the remaining victims. However, now the number of victims driven to the Medan refugee camp has increased to more than 7,000. The Indonesian government's disregard for international trust and intensified persecution of overseas Chinese is outrageous and absolutely unacceptable.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission official then discussed the current anti-Chinese activities and the crazy persecution of overseas Chinese by the Indonesian government, as well as the broad overseas Chinese's forced self-defense struggle. He said that after the Indonesian reactionaries launched a counter-revolutionary military coup in October 1965, they massacred large numbers of Indonesian people on the one hand and burned, killed, and looted overseas Chinese on the other, committing all kinds of atrocities and cruel persecutions. Currently, the Indonesian government is using new tricks to conduct anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. On the one hand, it incites right-wing thugs to openly and on a large scale attack overseas Chinese in various places, and on the other hand, it publishes or restores some anti-Chinese decrees, legalizing the anti-Chinese violence that occurs in various places in Indonesia.

The official pointed out that currently, many regions in Indonesia are implementing the infamous Presidential Decree No. 10, which prohibits overseas Chinese from living in counties and below, and are conducting large-scale forced relocations of overseas Chinese. At the same time, from Sumatra to Kalimantan, many regions are conducting large-scale expulsions of overseas Chinese. For example, in the Aceh region of North Sumatra, a large number of overseas Chinese have been expelled. In West Kalimantan, the Indonesian government is openly colluding with "Malaysia" to expel and persecute overseas Chinese on a large scale. When the Indonesian government forces the relocation and expulsion of overseas Chinese, it seizes all the personal living necessities that overseas Chinese have obtained with their blood and sweat. The Indonesian reactionaries even boasted that overseas Chinese are not allowed to take any belongings back to their country and must "swim back" in the sea. In the East Java region, the reactionary authorities have also promulgated four anti-China and anti-Chinese decrees, prohibiting overseas Chinese from engaging in any business, forcing overseas Chinese to pay high head taxes, and now many overseas Chinese have been driven to death by the reactionary authorities.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission official emphasized that where there is oppression, there is resistance. The broad overseas Chinese in Indonesia remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, defend the dignity of the motherland, uphold national dignity, defend the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese, and have waged a resolute struggle against the cruel persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries. For example, in the face of the rampant reactionary atmosphere in West Java's Bandung and especially in various places in East Java, the broad overseas Chinese have waged unyielding and heroic struggles against the reactionary authorities' various brutal and unreasonable persecutions. They are right, and they have done well! We express our warm concern and high respect for them.

The official pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government's crazy persecution of overseas Chinese exposed the reactionaries' brutal and weak nature. The overseas Chinese's self-defense struggle greatly boosted the people's morale and greatly dampened the reactionaries' arrogance, thus winning the sympathy and support of the Indonesian people. Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people have once again become friends who share weal and woe in the struggle.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission official emphasized that the Indonesian reactionary ruling clique is a loyal dog of American imperialism and also receives open support from the Soviet revisionists. The Indonesian government's crazy anti-China and anti-Chinese activities are entirely to cater to the needs of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism's joint anti-China actions. At the same time, after seizing power, the Indonesian reactionaries, due to the increasingly sharp class contradictions at home, in order to shift the target of domestic struggles, are trying to stir up a tide of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities and attempt to sever the connection between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people.

The Indonesian government's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities not only severely trampled on the legitimate rights of the broad overseas Chinese but also greatly harmed the interests of the Indonesian people, causing serious economic difficulties in Indonesia. Currently, various places in Indonesia are filled with public resentment, and the broad Indonesian people are standing more closely with the hardworking overseas Chinese. As Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese idiom used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are also such a bunch of fools." History will determine that the Indonesian reactionaries' anti-China and anti-Chinese activities will inevitably backfire!

    华侨事务委员会负责人向新华社记者发表谈话
    强烈谴责印尼政府破坏我接侨工作
    印尼政府为了迎合美帝苏修联合反华需要，不顾国际信义，变本加厉地迫害华侨，刁难和阻挠我第四次接侨船只启航，是绝对不能容忍的。印尼政府对由此产生的一切后果，必须承担全部责任。
    新华社二十九日讯　华侨事务委员会负责人今天向本社记者发表谈话，强烈谴责印度尼西亚政府阻挠我国政府第四次派船接运自愿回国的受害华侨。这位负责人指出，我国政府的接侨船只，由于印尼政府的刁难和阻挠，至今尚未启航。印尼政府对由此产生的一切后果，必须承担全部责任。
    侨委负责人强烈谴责印尼反动政府一贯地破坏和阻挠我国的接侨工作，并且在我国接运受害华侨回国期间加紧反华排华，更加残酷地迫害华侨。
    负责人说，印尼反动派对我国三次派船到棉兰接侨，都曾连续进行捣乱，但都遭到了可耻的失败。在我国接侨船准备第四次前往棉兰的时候，它们又无理限制我船上接侨工作组人员取得签证的人数，对我蓄意进行刁难。虽然经过我多次交涉，但印尼方面至今尚未取消它们的无理限制，影响到我接侨船至今未能开航。
    负责人指出，中国政府派船前往印尼棉兰接运自愿回国的受害华侨，是中国政府同印尼政府进行了长期斗争的结果。印尼政府是在理屈词穷的情况下，才不得不同意中国政府的这一合理要求的。中国政府每次接回的受害华侨，都以大量事实揭露了印尼政府迫害华侨的种种残暴罪行。疯狂地进行反华排华的印尼政府遭到了国际舆论的强烈谴责，弄得声名狼藉，狼狈不堪。因此，印尼政府极不甘心让中国顺利进行接侨工作，它处处想方设法进行阻挠。
    侨委负责人在谈到印尼政府前几次阻挠我国接侨工作所施展的伎俩时指出，印尼政府曾经极力阻挠中国领事官员前往棉兰处理接侨事务，妄图由它单方面安排我国的接侨工作。同时，印尼政府和棉兰反动当局还曾无理逮捕拷打我四十一名华侨青少年，组织暴徒疯狂袭击棉兰集中营的难侨，袭击破坏中国驻棉兰领事馆等，它们过去使用的这些伎俩，正是它丑恶面目的暴露。现在，印尼政府又无理限制我国接侨船工作组的登岸人数，妄图通过限制必要的工作人员登岸安排接侨工作，来阻挠和破坏我国接侨工作的进行。负责人强调指出，我国接侨船因为印尼政府的这种阻挠而迟迟不能开航，由此而产生的一切后果，印尼政府必须承担全部责任。
    负责人强调说，我国政府一再照会印尼政府，要求它尊重国际关系准则，遵守两国的有关条约和协定，立即停止迫害华侨。但是，印尼政府非但不收敛它迫害华侨的暴行，反而利用我国接侨的机会，变本加厉地驱逐华侨。负责人说，去年九月我国开始接侨时，印尼外交部通知我方，从亚齐地区被驱逐到棉兰集中的受害华侨，共有四千五百人。我国接侨船三次到棉兰，已接回了三千一百五十八人，按理第四航次就可以基本接完其余的受害华侨。可是，现在被驱逐到棉兰难侨集中营里的受害华侨竟又增加到七千多人。印尼政府这样不顾国际信义，变本加厉地迫害华侨，是令人愤慨的，是绝对不能容忍的。
    侨委负责人接着谈到印尼政府目前的排华活动和疯狂迫害华侨的情况，以及广大华侨被迫进行的自卫反抗斗争。他说，印尼反动派于一九六五年十月发动反革命军事政变以后，一方面大批屠杀印尼人民，同时对华侨烧杀抢掠，无恶不作，进行残酷的迫害。目前，印尼政府又采取了新的花招进行反华排华，它一面唆使右派暴徒在各地公开地大规模地袭击华侨，一面公布或恢复一些排华法令，使印尼各地发生的排华暴行合法化。
    负责人指出，目前，印尼的许多地区，都在执行臭名远扬的禁止华侨在县以下地区居住的总统第十号排华法令，对华侨进行大规模的逼迁。同时，从苏门答腊到加里曼丹，有不少地区还在大规模地驱逐华侨。如北苏门答腊亚齐地区，已驱逐了大批华侨。在西加里曼丹，印尼政府竟公开同“马来西亚”勾结，大规模地驱逐、迫害华侨。印尼政府在逼迁和驱逐华侨时，对于华侨用血汗换来的私人生活资料，尽行掠夺。印尼反动派甚至扬言，不准华侨携带任何物品回国，要让华侨在大海中“游泳回去”。在东爪哇地区，反动当局还公布了四项反华排华法令，禁止华侨从事任何经营，强迫华侨缴纳高额人头税，现在已有华侨多人被反动当局活活逼死。
    侨委负责人强调说，那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。印尼广大华侨牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，维护祖国尊严，坚持民族气节，维护华侨的正当权益，同印尼反动派的残酷迫害进行了坚决的斗争。例如，在反动气焰嚣张的西爪哇万隆，特别是在东爪哇各地，广大华侨对于反动当局各种横蛮无理的迫害，都在进行坚强不屈的英勇斗争。他们做得对，做得好！我们对他们表示亲切的关怀和崇高的敬意。
    负责人指出，印尼反动政府疯狂迫害华侨，暴露了印尼反动派残暴虚弱的本质。华侨的自卫斗争，大长了人民的志气，大灭了反动派的威风，因此得到了印尼人民的同情和支持。华侨和印尼人民又一次在斗争中结成了共患难的朋友。
    华侨事务委员会负责人强调说，印尼反动统治集团是美帝国主义豢养的忠实走狗，而且得到苏联修正主义的公开支持。印尼政府疯狂反华排华，完全是为了迎合美帝国主义和苏联修正主义联合反华的需要。同时，印尼反动派在篡夺政权后，由于国内阶级矛盾日益尖锐，为了转移国内斗争的目标，它竭力掀起一股反华排华的逆流，并企图借此割断华侨与印尼人民的联系。
    印尼政府的反华排华，不但严重地摧残了广大华侨的正当权益，同时也极大地损害了印尼人民的利益，造成了印尼经济的严重困难。目前印尼各地民怨沸腾，广大印尼人民正和劳苦华侨更加紧密地站在一起。这正如毛主席所说的：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”历史将注定，印尼反动派的反华排华，必将自食其恶果！
