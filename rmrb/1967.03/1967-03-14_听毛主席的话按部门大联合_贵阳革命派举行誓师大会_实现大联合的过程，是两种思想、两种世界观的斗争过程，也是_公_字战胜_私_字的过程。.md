Follow Chairman Mao’s Instructions to Unite by Department
Guangxi Revolutionary Masses Hold a Swearing-in Rally

The process of achieving great unity is a struggle between two ideologies and two worldviews, and it is also a process of “public” overcoming “private.”

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, March 13 — Nearly 10,000 revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Guiyang held a swearing-in rally in the plaza of the Telecommunications Building in the afternoon of March 12, vowing to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly study the experience of great unity by system, by unit, and by administrative department in Qingdao City and Guiyang Cotton Mill, implement great unity, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The news of “Great Unity by Administrative Department in Guiyang Cotton Mill” published in People’s Daily on March 1 and the editorial “A Good Form of Great Unity of the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat” have sparked a strong response in Guiyang. In recent days, many units’ revolutionary masses of the proletariat have rushed to Guiyang Cotton Mill to learn and gain experience. They learn from the experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill, combine it with the actual situation of their own units, and actively achieve revolutionary great unity. Many units have realized great unity from the bottom up by administrative department after discussion and preparation, and have established revolutionary “three-in-one” temporary power organs — Revolutionary Committees. This swearing-in rally will further promote the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the city by unit and by industry, to meet the needs of the current revolutionary struggle, and to complete the battle tasks at hand.

At the meeting, revolutionary warriors of the proletariat, holding red copies of “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” read aloud in unison: “The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history.” “National unity and people’s unity, unity among all nationalities in the country — these are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause.” “We are not only good at destroying an old world, we are also good at building a new world.”

The meeting began with shouts of “Long live Chairman Mao!” “Chairman Mao will live ten thousand years!” and the songs “The East Is Red” and “Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman.”

At the meeting, the “Decision on Promoting and Learning from the Experience of Great Unity of the Proletarian Revolutionary Masses in Guiyang Cotton Mill” by the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and the “Decision on Great Unity by Unit and by Department in the New Situation by the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat in Guizhou” by the General Headquarters of the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat in Guizhou Province were read out.

The decision of the General Headquarters of the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat in Guizhou Province states: The “headquarters” and “command centers” of revolutionary mass organizations across industries and sectors in the Guiyang area should be immediately disbanded, and their leadership over subordinate organizations and branch offices in prefectures, cities, and counties should be canceled. After the original headquarters are disbanded, a small preparatory group can be set up to supervise this work. All organizations that have been established by system should carry out great unity from the bottom up and rectify and purify the ranks.

The decision calls for the extensive promotion of the experience of Qingdao City and Guiyang Cotton Mill, the dissolution of cross-industry and cross-sector headquarters (including subordinate cross-unit and cross-department brigades and teams). In units where the revolutionary masses truly hold power, according to the experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill, the original combat teams should be dissolved, and great unity should be implemented from the bottom up by workshop, workshop, and office, establishing a unified revolutionary mass organization; implementing the revolutionary “three-in-one” combination, establishing a temporary power organ — the Revolutionary Committee.

The decision points out: Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of great unity. In the process of carrying out great unity from the bottom up by department and establishing Revolutionary Committees, it is necessary to take Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, highlight proletarian politics, do a good job in political and ideological work, and carry out rectification. While uniting, rectifying, and fighting, the experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill proves that it is necessary to unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, break down the “private” character, correct various erroneous tendencies, and patiently do ideological education work for the members, especially the ideological work for the headquarters cadres. This is one of the keys to achieving great unity of the revolutionary masses.

Representatives of the Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Cotton Mill and the “March 1” Combat Team of Mao Zedong Thought in Guiyang Cotton Mill spoke at the meeting. He said: The proletarian revolutionary masses of our Guiyang Cotton Mill have broken through various obstacles, removed various obstacles, broken down the “private” character, established the “public” character, broken down the original organizational boundaries, and implemented great unity from the bottom up by administrative department. Reviewing the few months of struggle, we deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses. The process of achieving great unity is also a process of struggle between two ideologies and two worldviews, a process of “public” overcoming “private.” In the struggle, as long as we follow Chairman Mao’s instructions and walk the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we will definitely be victorious.

Representatives of the Red Worker Combat Team of Mao Zedong Thought in Guizhou Province, the Guiyang Combat Team of Mao Zedong Thought, and the Cultural and Scientific Research Combat Team of Mao Zedong Thought in Guizhou Province and Guiyang City expressed at the meeting: The “Decision on Promoting and Learning from the Experience of Great Unity of the Proletarian Revolutionary Masses in Guiyang Cotton Mill” by the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and the “Decision on Great Unity by Unit and by Department in the New Situation by the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat in Guizhou” by the General Headquarters of the Revolutionary Masses of the Proletariat in Guizhou Province reflect our aspirations and urgent demands. We will definitely implement them conscientiously. Chairman Mao teaches us: “So many things, always urgent; the earth turns, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment.” We say do it and do it, we must quickly implement the revolutionary great unity from the bottom up by department, seize the revolution, promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

After the proletarian revolutionary masses of Guiyang Cotton Mill achieved great unity by administrative department, they launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, and the spiritual face of the workers was completely renewed, with new people and new things emerging in layers. This is the original workers of the front spinning class B, who participated in various revolutionary organizations and did not participate in revolutionary organizations, studying Chairman Mao’s works together.

    听毛主席的话按部门大联合  
    贵阳革命派举行誓师大会
    实现大联合的过程，是两种思想、两种世界观的斗争过程，也是“公”字战胜“私”字的过程。
    新华社贵阳十三日电　贵阳地区无产阶级革命派近一万人于十二日下午在电信综合大楼广场举行按单位按部门大联合誓师大会，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真学习青岛市和贵阳棉纺厂分系统、按单位、按行政部门大联合的经验，实行大联合，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    《人民日报》三月一日发表的《贵阳棉纺厂按行政部门搞联合》的消息和《无产阶级革命派大联合的好形式》的社论，在贵阳地区引起了热烈的反应。连日来，许多单位的无产阶级革命派竞相到贵阳棉纺厂学经取宝。他们学习贵阳棉纺厂的经验，结合本单位的实际情况，积极实现革命的大联合。不少单位经过酝酿讨论，已经实现了自下而上地按行政部门的大联合，并且建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——革命委员会。这次誓师大会，将进一步促进全市无产阶级革命派的按单位、按行业大联合，以适应当前的革命斗争形势的需要，胜利地完成面临的战斗任务。
    会上，无产阶级革命派战士们，手捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”
    大会在“毛主席万岁”、“毛主席万寿无疆”的欢呼声和《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中开始。
    会上，宣读了贵州省革命委员会《关于推广、学习贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派大联合的经验的决定》和贵州省无产阶级革命派总指挥部《关于贵州无产阶级革命派在新形势下按单位按部门实行大联合的决定》。
    贵州省无产阶级革命派总指挥部的决定中说：贵阳地区跨行、跨业的革命群众组织的“总部”、“司令部”应立即撤销，并取消对所属组织及在专、州、县的分设机构的领导权。原有总部撤销之后，可留少量人员成立一个促进按单位、按行业实行大联合的筹备小组，负责督促这项工作。凡已分系统成立的组织，应自下而上地进行大联合，整顿、纯洁队伍。
    决定要求大力推广青岛市和贵阳棉纺厂的经验，解散跨行跨业的总部（包括下属的跨单位、跨部门的纵队和大队）。在革命派真正掌权的单位，按贵阳棉纺厂的经验，解散原有战斗队，自下而上地按班组、车间、科室实行大联合，建立统一的革命群众组织；实行革命的“三结合”，建立临时的权力机构——革命委员会。
    决定指出：毛泽东思想是大联合的灵魂。在进行自下而上地按部门的大联合和建立革命委员会中，必须以毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，认真做好政治思想工作，认真进行整风，边联合，边整风，边战斗。贵阳棉纺厂的经验证明，必须在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来，大破“私”字，纠正各种错误思想倾向，要耐心地向队员做好思想教育工作，特别是做好总部干部的思想工作，这是实现革命派大联合关键之一。
    贵阳棉纺厂革命委员会、毛泽东思想贵阳棉纺厂“三·一”战斗团的代表在会上发言。他说：我们贵阳棉纺厂的无产阶级革命派，冲破各种阻力，扫除各种障碍，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，打破原有的组织界线，实行了自下而上的按行政部门的大联合。回顾几个月的斗争，我们深深地体会到，毛泽东思想是我们无产阶级革命派大联合的灵魂。实现大联合的过程，也就是两种思想、两种世界观的斗争过程，是“公”字战胜“私”字的过程。在斗争中，只要我们听毛主席的话，按毛主席所指引的路走，就一定会胜利。
    毛泽东思想贵州省红色工人战斗团、毛泽东思想贵阳战斗团、贵州省省、市毛泽东思想文化科研战斗团等组织的代表，在会上表示：贵州省革命委员会《关于推广、学习贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派大联合的经验的决定》和贵州省无产阶级革命派总指挥部《关于贵州无产阶级革命派在新形势下按单位按部门实行大联合的决定》，反映了我们的愿望和迫切要求，我们一定认真贯彻执行。毛主席教导我们：“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”我们说干就干，一定要把自下而上地按部门的革命大联合最迅速地搞起来，抓革命，促生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！（附图片）
    贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派按行政部门实现了大联合以后，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，职工精神面貌焕然一新，新人新事层出不穷。这是前纺乙班原来参加各革命组织和没有参加革命组织的职工在一起学习毛主席著作。
