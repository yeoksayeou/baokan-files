Comrade Xhehu recently gave important instructions on the further revolutionization of the People's Army at a meeting of the basic Party organization of a tank unit of the Albanian People's Army. Comrade Xhehu stressed that the decisive factor in determining the outcome of war is not weapons, but people. To carry the revolution through to the end, it is decisive to further revolutionize people's thinking.

At the meeting to summarize work and elect new leaders, Comrade Xhehu praised the revolutionary fighting spirit shown by this organization in completing its tasks and highly evaluated the meeting's spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

Comrade Xhehu said, although we are surrounded by imperialist and revisionist countries, we stand firm like a rock. We are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with all imperialists and revisionists. Our contradictions with them are irreconcilable. Therefore, Communist Party members, Party organizations, and all military personnel must heighten their revolutionary vigilance against domestic and foreign enemies, strengthen war preparedness, and further revolutionize their thinking. In this way, no force can stop our continuous advance.

Comrade Xhehu stressed that the Party teaches us that to revolutionize our troops, we must proceed from two basic principles: the decisive factor in determining the outcome of war is not weapons, but people; in the troops, ideological work must be placed above technical work, and the work of educating people must be placed above technical work. To implement these two principles will temper our troops politically and ideologically. Comrade Xhehu said that to revolutionize the troops, the Party must adopt the mass line in its work in the troops.

Comrade Xhehu also gave instructions on the revolutionization of troop training and other issues.

    谢胡同志就人民军革命化问题作重要指示 
    加强思想革命化把革命进行到底
    新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》报道，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局委员谢胡同志最近在阿尔巴尼亚人民军坦克某部的劳动党基层组织的一次会议上，就人民军的进一步革命化问题作了重要指示。谢胡同志强调指出，决定战争命运的因素不是武器，而是人，使人的思想进一步革命化，是把革命进行到底的决定性条件。
    谢胡同志在这个基层组织的总结和改选的会议上，赞扬了这个组织在完成任务时表现的革命战斗精神，并高度评价这次会议充满着批评与自我批评的精神。
    谢胡同志说，我们虽然处于帝国主义和修正主义国家的包围中，但我们象磐石一样屹立着，我们同一切帝国主义者和修正主义者进行针锋相对的斗争。我们同他们的矛盾是不可调和的。因此，共产党员、党组织和全体军人应该提高对国内外敌人的革命警惕，加强战备，使思想进一步革命化。这样，就没有任何力量可以阻挡我们不断前进。
    谢胡同志强调说，劳动党教导我们，为了使我们的部队革命化，必须从两个基本原则出发：决定战争命运的因素不是武器，而是人；在部队中要把思想工作放在技术工作之上，把教育人的工作放在技术工作之上。贯彻这两个原则，将使我们的部队在政治上和思想上受到锻炼。谢胡同志说，为了使部队革命化，党在部队中应采取群众路线的工作方法。
    谢胡同志还对部队训练工作的革命化等问题作了指示。（附图片）
