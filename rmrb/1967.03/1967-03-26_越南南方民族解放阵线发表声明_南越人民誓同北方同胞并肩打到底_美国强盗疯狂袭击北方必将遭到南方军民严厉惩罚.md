The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement. The people of South Vietnam pledge to stand shoulder to shoulder with their northern compatriots to fight to the end. The savage attacks by American aggressors on the North will be met with severe punishment from the military and civilian population of the South.

	NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on March 15 strongly condemning the recent series of U.S. imperialist bombings of industrial areas in northern Vietnam, including Thai Nguyen, Vinh Yen, and Hong Gai, as well as the capital city of Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, which are part of the U.S. war "escalation" actions.

	The statement exposed the series of crimes committed by the American aggressors against North Vietnam and pointed out that the American aggressors' frenzied and continuous war actions once again exposed the warlike, stubborn, and extremely brutal nature of U.S. imperialism, further revealing the hypocrisy of the Johnson administration's so-called "peace intentions" and "unconditional negotiations."

	The statement pointed out that the more the U.S. imperialists escalate the war, the more the people of the entire country will deepen their hatred for them, and the more determined they will be to defeat the common enemy of the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people around the world, the American aggressors.

	The statement strongly condemned and denounced the recent extremely barbaric war crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and fully supported the position of the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 1.

	The statement said that the heroic struggle of the northern military and civilian population to defend the North fully embodies the fraternal feelings of the rear for the frontline. The people of the South pledge to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the North and fight to the end. No matter how much the U.S. imperialists strengthen and expand their aggressive war, no matter how long the war lasts, and no matter what sacrifices are made, the people of the South will resolutely and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and their traitorous clique.

	The statement said that the military and civilian population of South Vietnam fully understand their mission on the frontline and are ready at any time to give the American aggressors the punishment they deserve. If they attack the North once, we will resolutely make them pay five times, ten times the price in blood.

	The statement called on all liberation armed forces and people in the South to make every effort, carry forward the glorious victories of the 1966-1967 winter-spring period, advance with the momentum, fight hard, and accurately strike the American aggressors and their lackeys, eliminate more American and puppet troops and mercenaries, avenge the compatriots killed by them in both the North and the South, and make the American aggressors' already and ongoing failure in their second "dry season offensive" and their plot to "pacify" the Mekong Delta suffer even more severe defeats.

    越南南方民族解放阵线发表声明
    南越人民誓同北方同胞并肩打到底
    美国强盗疯狂袭击北方必将遭到南方军民严厉惩罚
    新华社河内二十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义最近接连轰炸越南北方太原、越池、鸿基等工业区和首都河内市、海防港口的战争“升级”行动。
    声明揭露美国强盗对越南北方犯下的一系列罪行后指出，美国强盗的疯狂的、一系列的战争行动，再次暴露了美帝国主义的好战、顽固和极其残暴的面目，进一步暴露了约翰逊政府的所谓“和平诚意”和“无条件谈判”等论调的虚伪性。
    声明指出，美帝国主义越进行战争“升级”，越南全国人民就越加深对他们的仇恨，更加决心战胜越南人民和全世界爱好和平人民的共同敌人美国侵略强盗。
    声明强烈谴责和控诉美帝国主义最近犯下的极其野蛮的战争罪行，完全支持越南民主共和国外交部三月一日发表的声明的立场。
    声明说，北方军民为保卫北方而进行的英勇战斗充分体现了大后方对前线的骨肉兄弟的情感。南方人民誓同北方人民并肩战斗，坚决打到底。不管美帝国主义把它的侵略战争加强和扩大到什么程度，无论战争延长到多久，要作出多大牺牲，南方人民也坚决彻底打败美国侵略者及其卖国走狗集团。
    声明说，越南南方军民充分认识到自己在前线所担负的任务，随时准备坚决给美国强盗以应得的惩罚。如果它袭击北方一次，我们就坚决要它以五倍、十倍的代价来偿还血债。
    声明号召南方全体解放武装力量和人民，作出最大的努力，发扬一九六六——一九六七年冬春初期的辉煌胜利，乘胜前进，狠狠地打，准准地打，给美国强盗及其走狗以连续的打击，消灭更多的美、伪军和帮凶军，为被他们杀害的南北两方同胞报仇，使美国强盗已经和正在遭到失败的第二次“旱季反攻”和“绥靖”湄公河三角洲的阴谋，遭到更加惨重的失败。
