	British workers love Chairman Mao and eagerly wish to study the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

	Workers from many cities in Britain, including London, Birmingham, Nottingham, Coventry, Lancashire, York, Cardiff, and Southall, have written to the "Friends of China" organization in Britain, expressing their desire to obtain the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." Many of them also requested a complete set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" or portraits of Chairman Mao.

	A London craftsman wrote in his letter: "The teachings of Mao Zedong not only illuminate the seven hundred million Chinese people with brilliant sunshine, but also illuminate the workers of all countries with brilliant sunshine." He exclaimed: "Long live our beloved Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao belongs to all workers, to all true progressives of different skin colors and nationalities!"

	A worker from Coventry praised Chairman Mao as "the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time" and wished Chairman Mao eternal life. He pointed out that under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, China has become a revolutionary base for all those who rebel against oppression in the world. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a "revolution that shakes the world," striking at imperialism and modern revisionism. "All true revolutionaries should support this Cultural Revolution." He quoted Chairman Mao's teachings in his letter: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary. Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people only in words but acts differently is a revolutionary in words only. Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people both in words and in deeds is a complete revolutionary." He then said: "All true friends of China must support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution both in words and in deeds!"

	He concluded his letter by wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!

    据新华社伦敦十日电  英国劳动人民热爱毛主席，渴望学习光辉的毛泽东思想，热情支持由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    伦敦、伯明翰、诺丁汉、考文垂、兰开夏、约克、加的夫和索萨尔等城市的许多工人，写给在英国的“中国之友”组织的信中，都希望得到《毛主席语录》，其中许多人还索取全套《毛泽东选集》或毛主席像片。
    伦敦的一个手工业工人在信中写道：“毛泽东的教导，不仅是照耀着七亿中国人民的灿烂的阳光，而且也是照耀着各国劳动人民的灿烂的阳光。”他欢呼：“敬爱的毛主席万寿无疆！毛主席属于一切劳动人民，属于不同肤色和不同国籍的一切真正的进步者！”
    考文垂的一个工人在信中称颂毛主席是“当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆。他指出，在毛主席的英明领导下，中国已经成为世界上一切反对压迫的造反者的革命根据地。他说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是一场“震撼世界的革命”，它打击了帝国主义和现代修正主义。“所有真正的革命者都应当支持这场文化大革命”。他在信中引用了毛主席的语录：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。什么人只是口头上站在革命人民方面而在行动上则另是一样，他就是一个口头革命派，如果不但在口头上而且在行动上也站在革命人民方面，他就是一个完全的革命派。”然后说：“中国的一切真正的朋友都必须不但在口头上而且在行动上也支持无产阶级文化大革命！”
    他在信中祝毛泽东同志万寿无疆！
