Many Burmese workers love and actively study the Quotations from Chairman Mao. They praise Chairman Mao as the great leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world and hail the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the world in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Once, some workers in a factory obtained a copy of the Quotations from Chairman Mao. They felt immense happiness and joy. Everyone wanted to be the first to study this precious book, so they decided to take turns reading it. Later, they obtained more copies of the Quotations from Chairman Mao, ensuring that everyone had one. They studied it every day and sometimes held discussions. They said, "Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated our minds, and Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for us to advance. The Quotations from Chairman Mao have raised our proletarian consciousness."

Some workers in another factory did not know English, so they tried every possible way to collect the Quotations from Chairman Mao that had been translated into Burmese, compiled them into booklets, and then studied and discussed them together. They said, Chairman Mao's brilliant works have raised our revolutionary consciousness. The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the world in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, and the reactionaries of various countries.

A shop assistant in Mandalay, the second-largest city in Burma, said that he could not describe his love for the Quotations from Chairman Mao. He said, Mao Zedong Thought has armed the minds of the revolutionary people of the whole world and strengthened the confidence of the oppressed people in their struggle for liberation. Chairman Mao is not only the great helmsman and commander of the Chinese people but also the great helmsman and commander of the oppressed classes and revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world.

    缅甸许多工人积极学习《毛主席语录》
    毛泽东思想是反帝反修的强大武器
    据新华社仰光电　缅甸许多工人热爱《毛主席语录》，积极学习《毛主席语录》。他们赞扬毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是世界革命人民同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争的强大思想武器。
    有一次，某工厂的一些工人得到了一本《毛主席语录》，他们感到无比幸福和喜悦。人人都想第一个学习这本宝书，最后他们采取了轮流阅读的办法。后来，他们又得到了更多的《毛主席语录》，做到人手一册，他们就天天学习，有时还进行讨论。他们说：“毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想照亮了我们的思想，毛主席给我们指出了前进的方向。《毛主席语录》提高了我们的无产阶级觉悟。”
    有个工厂的一些工人不会英文，他们就想尽种种办法收集已经译成缅甸文的毛主席语录，汇编成小册子，然后在一起学习和讨论。他们说，毛主席的光辉著作使我们提高了革命觉悟。光辉的毛泽东思想是全世界革命人民同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争的强大思想武器。
    缅甸第二大城市曼德勒的一位店员说，他无法描述他热爱《毛主席语录》的心情。他说，毛泽东思想武装了全世界革命人民的头脑，增强了被压迫人民进行解放斗争的信心。毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大统帅和伟大舵手，而且也是世界上被压迫阶级和革命人民的伟大统帅和伟大舵手，毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。
