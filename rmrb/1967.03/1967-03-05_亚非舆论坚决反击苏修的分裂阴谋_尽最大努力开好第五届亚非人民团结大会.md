	Asian and African news workers' organizations have strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists for orchestrating and manipulating the so-called "Eighth Session of the Asian and African Solidarity Council" held in Nicosia on February 15, which has led to a public split in the Asian and African solidarity movement.

	The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionists have been desperately trying to sabotage the resolution passed at the Fourth Asian and African People's Solidarity Conference held in Winnipeg, which decided to hold the Fifth Asian and African People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing in 1967. They have been attempting to bring as many organizations as possible under their influence. The revisionists' attempts to sabotage the Asian and African people's cause will never succeed. The Nicosia farce foreshadows that in the era when the Asian and African people's struggle against U.S.-led imperialism is thriving, the revisionists are doomed to inevitable doom.

	The statement said that because the South West Africa People's Organization firmly supported the Winnipeg conference resolution, the Soviet revisionists illegally took high-handed measures to "expel" it from the Asian and African People's Solidarity Organization. They stuffed the Asian and African People's Solidarity Organization with such revisionist followers as the Ceylonese and Japanese splitist organizations. Despite their efforts to show their strength, this illegal Nicosia meeting still left the revisionists greatly disappointed.

	The Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists' Association expressed in the statement its full support for the stance taken by many member countries of the Asian and African People's Solidarity Organization: the Nicosia meeting manipulated by the Soviet revisionists has no right to discuss the venue of the Fifth Conference, and any unreasonable change to the Winnipeg resolution is illegal and therefore null and void.

	The statement emphasized that the true interests of the people in the struggles of Asia and Africa will be fully reflected in the Fifth Asian and African People's Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing—the center of the world revolution, which is itself undergoing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.

	The statement finally expressed that the Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists' Association will make every effort to ensure the success of the Fifth Asian and African People's Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing, and will resolutely fight against all splitist, capitulationist, and betrayal activities led by Soviet revisionism, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism.

	According to a report from London by Xinhua News Agency, the Malaya People's Asian and African Solidarity Committee issued a statement on February 21st here, pointing out that "modern revisionists should bear the responsibility for the public split in the Asian and African People's Solidarity Organization."

	The statement condemned the so-called "Eighth Session of the Asian and African Solidarity Council" held recently in Nicosia under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists. The statement pointed out that this meeting ended in a complete exposure and failure of the modern revisionists led by the Soviet ruling clique and their lackeys.

	The statement called on "all truly anti-imperialist organizations to participate in the Fifth Asian and African People's Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing this year, to establish a broad anti-imperialist united front on a solid foundation."

	According to a report from Cairo by Xinhua News Agency, Sitole, representative of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee in Cairo, issued a statement on February 25th in Cairo, strongly condemning the Soviet modern revisionists' plot to split the Asian and African People's Solidarity Organization, and expressing full support for the Fifth Asian and African People's Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing this year.

	The statement pointed out: "The Soviet revisionists' recent activities in Nicosia to split the Asian and African People's Solidarity Organization once again prove that Soviet revisionism, in its attempt to suppress the struggles of the oppressed peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, is playing the role of the number one running dog of U.S.-led imperialism."

	The statement said: "The Soviet revisionists and their few lackeys illegally overturned the resolution of the Fourth Asian and African People's Solidarity Conference held in Winnipeg regarding the holding of the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year. However, the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee fully supports the resolution of the Winnipeg conference regarding the holding of the Fifth Conference in Beijing this year."

	The statement condemned the Soviet revisionists' absurd and illegal "expulsion" of the South West Africa People's Organization from the Asian and African People's Solidarity Organization, and pointed out that such a divisive tactic completely violates the principles of the Asian and African People's Solidarity Organization.

    亚非舆论坚决反击苏修的分裂阴谋
    尽最大努力开好第五届亚非人民团结大会
    新华社三日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处二日发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者二月十五日策划和操纵在尼科西亚召开所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议，从而造成亚非人民团结运动的公开分裂。
    声明指出，苏联修正主义者一直拚命企图破坏在温尼巴举行的第四届亚非人民团结大会通过的关于一九六七年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议，并纠集尽可能多的组织处于自己的影响之下。修正主义者破坏亚非人民事业的企图永远不能得逞。尼科西亚骗局预示，在亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争蓬勃高涨的时代，等待着修正主义者的是不可避免的灭亡。
    声明说，由于西南非洲民族联盟坚决拥护温尼巴大会的决议，苏修就非法地采取高压手段把它从亚非人民团结组织中“开除出去”。他们把锡兰和日本的分裂主义组织这样一些修正主义追随者塞进亚非人民团结组织中去，尽管他们想方设法来大大显示他们的力量，但是这次非法的尼科西亚会议仍然使修正主义者大失所望。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处在声明中表示，完全支持亚非人民团结组织许多会员国所采取的立场：苏修所操纵的尼科西亚会议根本没有权利讨论第五届大会的会议地点问题，任何无理改变温尼巴决议的行动都是非法的，因此，也是无效的。
    声明强调说，亚非两洲斗争中的人民的真正利益将充分反映于将在北京——世界革命的中心，它本身正在毛泽东主席的领导下进行着文化大革命——举行的第五届亚非人民团结大会上。
    声明最后表示，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处将尽自己最大的努力来使在北京举行的第五届亚非人民团结大会获得成功，并将坚决为反对以苏联修正主义为首的美帝国主义的帮凶的一切分裂主义、投降主义和背叛的活动而斗争。
    据新华社伦敦电　马来亚人民亚非团结委员会二月二十一日在这里向报界发表声明指出，“现代修正主义者应对造成亚非人民团结组织的公开分裂承担责任”。
    声明谴责在苏联修正主义者操纵之下最近在尼科西亚非法举行的所谓亚非人民团结组织“第八届理事会会议”。声明指出，这次会议已经“以苏联统治集团为首的现代修正主义者及其走卒的彻底暴露和失败”而告终。
    声明号召，“一切真正反帝的组织参加今年将在北京举行的第五届亚非人民团结组织大会，以便在坚实的基础上建立广泛的反帝统一战线”。
    据新华社开罗电　莫三鼻给革命委员会驻开罗代表西托尔二月二十五日在开罗发表声明，强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义者分裂亚非人民团结组织的阴谋，并表示完全支持今年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会。
    声明指出：“苏联修正主义者最近在尼科西亚分裂亚非人民团结组织的活动再一次证明：苏联修正主义在企图压制非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲被压迫人民的斗争方面，正在充当以美国为首的帝国主义的头号帮凶的角色。”
    声明说：“苏修和他们的几个走卒非法推翻了温尼巴第四届亚非人民团结大会关于今年在北京举行第五届大会的决议。但是，莫三鼻给革命委员会完全支持温尼巴决议所规定的今年在北京举行第五届大会。”
    声明谴责苏修荒谬地、非法地把西南非洲民族联盟“开除”出亚非人民团结组织，并且指出，这种制造分裂的手段完全违反了亚非人民团结组织的原则。
