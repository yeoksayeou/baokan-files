Li Shunda said: If one fears not being able to become a labor model and hesitates or dodges in the face of major issues, not daring to stand up and fight, then one does not deserve to be called a labor model.

The revolutionary factions and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Pingxian County praised: Li Shunda, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, leads the charge in revolution and sets the standard in production, setting a good example for us!

In the struggle for the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the nationally renowned labor model Li Shunda, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions of Pingxian County, stood firmly united and fought side by side. They overthrew the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Pingxian County Party Committee and seized back the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture into the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. He actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions, established a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ, pushing the revolution and production of the entire county to a new high tide. The proletarian revolutionary factions and poor and lower-middle peasants of Pingxian County enthusiastically praised Li Shunda, saying: Li Shunda, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, leads the charge in every battle; in establishing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leading group, Li Shunda set a very good example for us!

For a long time, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party resisted the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, using every means to try to pull down the red flag of Li Shunda. Li Shunda actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, taking the lead in establishing agricultural production cooperatives; the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists maliciously said this was "rash advancement" and arbitrarily and despotically disbanded the cooperatives. When Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee called for building the mountains as Li Shunda did, they spread rumors saying: "Li Shunda's experience is outdated and useless." They wanted to bring Li Shunda down. They also used the name of "labor model training" to shoot cold arrows and make personal attacks on Li Shunda. Li Shunda, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, was not afraid of the slander and attacks of the class enemies. He bravely stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Li Shunda insisted on the socialist road and resolutely resisted and fought against the revisionist policies implemented by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the former Shanxi Provincial Committee, former Jin Dongnan Sub-bureau, and former Pingxian County Committee. He carried out uncompromising struggles against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Li Shunda has actively responded to Chairman Mao's teaching: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." He stood at the forefront of the class struggle and waged resolute struggles against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. He said: "If one fears not being able to become a labor model and hesitates or dodges in the face of major issues, not daring to stand up and fight, then one does not deserve to be called a labor model." Last winter, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Pingxian County just began, some revolutionary youngsters within the County Committee aimed at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and posted the first revolutionary big-character poster. The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists organized royalist forces everywhere to attack the revolutionary factions, implementing white terror. At this critical moment, Li Shunda stood out and said to the revolutionary youngsters: "You wrote correctly, you posted well! Your big-character poster expressed the feelings of us poor and lower-middle peasants, I firmly support you!" Li Shunda took out a red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said: "In our struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.'" Li Shunda's firm support for the revolutionary youngsters gave them great encouragement. Later, the conservative forces attempted to use Li Shunda's prestige among the masses to pull him over to their side in every possible way. Li Shunda firmly rejected them. He said: "I don't want to be an official, I only want to follow Chairman Mao and make revolution."

In the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions of Pingxian County to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, Li Shunda, together with the proletarian revolutionary factions, actively and seriously implemented Chairman Mao's policy of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," making the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" of Pingxian County a model for the counties in Shanxi. In late January, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Pingxian County seized power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the County Committee. Li Shunda went to the County People's Armed Forces Department and, together with the PLA, discussed the problems existing in the struggle to seize power and studied ways to solve these problems. The former deputy county magistrate of Pingxian, Long Qingyun, was an old cadre from the anti-Japanese war period, loyal to the Party, and had always been suppressed and attacked by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. When the royalist forces and some uninformed masses attacked Long Qingyun, Li Shunda stood out and said: "Long Qingyun is a good comrade! He has always fought against those bad guys within the County Committee and the arrows should not be directed at Comrade Long Qingyun." Li Shunda explained the situation to the masses, and Long Qingyun also actively stood out to "come out" and stood with the proletarian revolutionary factions.

After the proletarian revolutionary factions of Pingxian County seized power, they established the Pingxian County Revolutionary Rebel Command, and Li Shunda was elected as the chairman. He, together with the revolutionary masses, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and often kept in touch with the County People's Armed Forces Department. He, together with the revolutionary factions, conducted a comprehensive class analysis of the cadres at the level of bureau and section chiefs and above in Pingxian County and explained to the masses that the majority of the cadres were good or relatively good. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, due to the enthusiastic help of Li Shunda and the proletarian revolutionary factions, some leading cadres who had many reservations in the past also stood out to "come out."

Li Shunda often gave warm care to the responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations. He actively encouraged the revolutionary youngsters to boldly take on leadership work, encouraging them to do and to dare. For the shortcomings that appeared in their work, Li Shunda enthusiastically helped them.

Li Shunda firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and took Chairman Mao's instructions as the guiding principle for all work. Since the beginning of the rural Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Xigou Brigade, under Li Shunda's leadership, has always insisted on making revolution at night and engaging in production during the day. Last winter and this spring, Li Shunda almost got up early and went to bed late every day, taking the lead in all hard work. Under his influence, the vast majority of the brigade members of Xigou Brigade insisted on attending work every day. In just one winter, they built a three-meter-high, one-meter-wide, and one hundred and twenty-zhang-long big stone dam, turning fifty mu of wasteland into flat and tidy Da Zhai fields.

To push the production of the entire Pingxian County to a new high tide, at Li Shunda's initiative, the county held a "grasp revolution, promote production" mobilization meeting. Li Shunda, Wu Houli, Wang Changfu, and several other labor models issued a call to the entire county to "grasp revolution and promote production." To fire the first shot of spring production, Li Shunda, together with the County People's Armed Forces Department, vigorously grasped the construction of the leading groups of production brigades and teams. Currently, eighty-six percent of the production brigades and teams in the entire county have established their leading groups.

Comrade Li Shunda, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led the charge in everything, so the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary youngsters all praised: Our old model Li Shunda, leads the charge in revolution and sets the standard in production; he is both a revolutionary vanguard and a labor model!

		Li Shunda and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigou Brigade are writing big-character posters, expressing their most resolute response to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, determined to grasp revolution, promote production, and fire the first shot of spring production.

    李顺达——革命的闯将，生产的模范
    李顺达说：如果害怕自己当不上劳动模范，在大是大非面前躲躲闪闪，不敢起来斗争，那就不配当一个劳动模范。
    平顺县革命派和广大贫下中农赞扬说：李顺达在文化大革命中，革命打冲锋，生产当标兵，为我们树立了好榜样！
    在无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，全国著名劳动模范李顺达，和平顺县的无产阶级革命派紧紧地团结在一起，战斗在一起，造了平顺县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，把平顺县的党、政、财、文大权夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。他积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，同无产阶级革命派一起，建立起革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，把全县的革命和生产推向了一个新高潮。平顺县的无产阶级革命派和贫下中农，热情洋溢地赞扬李顺达说：李顺达在文化大革命中，处处冲锋陷阵；在建立革命的“三结合”的领导班子中，李顺达为我们树立了很好的榜样！
    长期以来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对抗毛主席和党中央的指示，千方百计地想把李顺达这面红旗拔掉。李顺达积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，带头成立农业生产合作社；一小撮反革命修正主义分子就别有用心地说，这是“冒进”，并独断专横地把合作社砍掉。毛主席、党中央号召，要象李顺达那样勤俭办社建设山区，他们就造谣说：“李顺达的经验老了，不中用了。”他们一心想把李顺达整垮。他们还以“劳模集训”为名，放冷枪、射暗箭，恶毒地对李顺达进行人身攻击。用毛泽东思想武装起来的李顺达同志，不怕阶级敌人的造谣中伤，勇敢地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。李顺达同志坚持社会主义道路，对原山西省委、原晋东南地委和原平顺县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的修正主义政策，进行了坚决的抵制和反抗，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，进行了不调和的斗争。
    文化大革命以来，李顺达积极响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，站在阶级斗争的最前列，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了坚决的斗争。他说：“如果害怕自己当不上劳动模范，在大是大非面前躲躲闪闪，不敢起来斗争，那就不配当一个劳动模范。”去年冬天，平顺县的文化大革命刚开始时，县委内的一些革命小将对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开火，贴出了第一张革命的大字报。一小撮反革命修正主义分子就到处组织保皇势力，对革命派进行围攻，实行白色恐怖，就在这个关键时刻，李顺达站出来对革命小将说：“你们写得对，你们贴得好！你们的大字报写出了我们贫下中农的心里话，我坚决支持你们！”李顺达拿出红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》说：“我们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争，必须牢记毛主席的这个教导：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’”李顺达对革命小将的坚决支持，给了他们巨大的鼓舞。后来，保守势力企图利用李顺达在群众中的威信，千方百计地拉拢李顺达。李顺达断然拒绝。他说：“我不想当什么官，我只想紧跟毛主席闹革命。”
    在平顺县无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，李顺达和无产阶级革命派一起积极地、认真地贯彻执行毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，使平顺县的革命的“三结合”成为山西各县的模范。一月下旬，平顺县的无产阶级革命派夺了平顺县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，李顺达就到县人民武装部，和解放军共同商量，提出了夺权斗争中存在的问题，并研究了解决这些问题的办法。原平顺县副县长龙庆云是抗日时期的老干部，对党忠心耿耿，一直受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的排斥和打击。当保皇势力和一些不明真相的群众对龙庆云进行围攻时，李顺达站出来说：“龙庆云是个好同志！他一贯和县委内那些坏家伙进行斗争，不应该把矛头指向龙庆云同志。”李顺达向群众讲明了情况，龙庆云也积极站出来“亮相”，和无产阶级革命派站在一起。
    平顺县无产阶级革命派夺权后，成立了平顺县革命造反指挥部，李顺达被推选为主任委员。他和革命群众在一起，活学活用毛主席著作，并经常和县人民武装部联系。他和革命派一起对平顺县科局长以上的干部全面地进行了阶级分析，向群众说明大多数干部是好的和比较好的。在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，由于李顺达和无产阶级革命派的热情帮助，一些过去有不少顾虑的领导干部都站出来“亮相”了。
    李顺达对革命群众组织的负责人也经常给予亲切的关怀。他积极鼓励革命小将们大胆地担负起领导工作，鼓励他们去干，去闯。对他们在工作中出现的一些缺点，李顺达满怀热情地进行帮助。
    李顺达牢牢记住毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把毛主席的指示当做一切工作的指针。自从农村文化大革命一开始，西沟大队在李顺达的领导下，一直坚持晚上闹革命，白天搞生产。去冬今春，李顺达差不多天天早起、晚睡，吃苦的事样样走在前头。在他的带动下，西沟大队的绝大部分社员天天坚持出勤。短短的一冬，他们修起了一条三米高，一米宽，长达一百二十丈的大石坝，把五十亩杂草乱石的山地，修成了平平整整的大寨田。
    为了把平顺全县的生产推向新高潮，在李顺达的倡议下，全县召开了“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会。李顺达、武侯梨、王长富等几个劳动模范，向全县发出了“狠抓革命，猛促生产”的倡议书。为了打响春耕生产第一炮，李顺达还和县人民武装部一起，狠抓各生产大队和生产队领导班子的建设。目前全县百分之八十六的生产大队和生产队领导班子已经健全起来。
    李顺达同志在文化大革命中样样走在前头，所以广大贫下中农和革命小将都赞扬说：咱们的老模范李顺达，革命打冲锋，生产当标兵；既是革命闯将，又是劳动模范！　　　　　　　　　　（新华社太原二十九日电）（附图片）
