Early in January, a delegation of Chinese students was invited to Paris to attend the conference of the Union of Black African Students in France. Both inside and outside the conference hall, they were always surrounded by friends from African countries and other nations. People asked them for Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's badges. After receiving a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," a student from Dahomey shouted, "This is the splendor of world revolution!" Many who did not get a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" left their addresses, requesting that copies be sent to them later. An African student wrote on the address slip, "Please bring the great thought of Mao Zedong to me."

    世界革命的光辉
    一月上旬，中国学生代表团应邀到巴黎参加黑非洲留法学生联合会的代表大会。他们在会内会外总是被非洲国家和其他国家的朋友们包围着；人们向他们索取毛主席著作和毛主席像章。一位达荷美学生拿到一本《毛主席语录》后喊道：“这是世界革命的光辉！”许多没有得到《毛主席语录》的人留下地址要求以后给他们寄去。一个非洲学生在留下的地址上还写道：“请把伟大的毛泽东思想带给我。”
