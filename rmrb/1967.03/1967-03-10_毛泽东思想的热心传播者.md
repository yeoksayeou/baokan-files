On the desks of Chinese journalists, there are a few cards, each seven inches long and four inches wide, featuring quotations from Chairman Mao. These are gifts from a Somalian friend who is enthusiastic about spreading Mao Zedong Thought.

This friend began studying Chairman Mao's works three months ago. He speaks Italian. At the beginning of his studies, since he couldn't find an Italian version of Chairman Mao's works, he had others read the English version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to him. One day, after obtaining a mimeographed Italian version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," his enthusiasm for study surged even higher.

Recently, to let more people understand the great Mao Zedong Thought, he carefully printed dozens of cards with Chairman Mao's quotations in both Italian and English and gave them to his friends. He specially selected quotations from Chairman Mao that expose American imperialism and call on the people of the world to rise up against American imperialist oppression. For example: "Imperialism is most afraid of the awakening of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the awakening of the people of all countries in the world. We must unite and drive American imperialism back to its own home from Asia, Africa, and Latin America." And so on.

Once, a reporter visited this friend's home. On his walls hung a portrait of Chairman Mao. Under his influence, his young child who had just begun to speak also loves Chairman Mao very much. Whenever guests ask him, "Where is Chairman Mao?" the child raises his little hand, points to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, and affectionately shouts, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao..."

    毛泽东思想的热心传播者
    在中国记者的办公桌上，放着几张长七寸、宽四寸的毛主席语录卡片，这是一位热心传播毛泽东思想的索马里朋友的赠品。
    这位朋友是在三个月之前开始学习毛主席著作的，他会说意大利语。开始学习时，因为找不到一本意文版的毛主席著作，他就让别人把英文的《毛主席语录》译读给他听。有一天，他得到了一本油印的意文版《毛主席语录》后，学习热情更加高涨。
    最近，他为了让更多的人了解伟大的毛泽东思想，便精心印制了数十张意大利文和英文的毛主席语录卡片，送给朋友们。他特别选择了毛主席揭露美帝国主义和号召全世界人民起来反对美帝国主义压迫的论述。如：“帝国主义最怕的是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民觉悟，怕世界各国人民的觉悟。我们要团结起来把美帝国主义从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲赶回它的老家去。”等等。
    记者有一次访问了这位朋友的家，他家里的墙上端端正正地挂着毛主席像。在他的教育下，他的一个刚学话的小孩也非常热爱毛主席。每当客人问他：“毛主席在哪里？”孩子便扬起小手，指着墙上的毛主席像，亲切地喊道：“毛主席，毛主席……。”
