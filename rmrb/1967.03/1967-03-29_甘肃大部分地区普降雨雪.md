Most of Gansu Province experienced widespread rain and snowfall from March 27 to March 28 at 8 AM. This rainfall was particularly heavy in the central regions. Min County received 42 millimeters of rain; Linzhou, Dingxi, Weiyuan, Linxia, Hezheng, and other counties received between 27 to 32 millimeters of rain; Lanzhou City, as well as the typically dry counties of Huining, Jingtai, Jingyuan, and Yongdeng, received between 11 to 25 millimeters of rain; other regions received around 5 millimeters of rain. Some areas in the Hexi Corridor continued to receive snow after 8 AM on March 28.

This rain and snowfall is beneficial for the sowing of spring wheat and summer mixed grains, and also promotes the growth of winter wheat. Prior to this, from March 13 to March 27, most of the province experienced three rounds of widespread rain and snowfall. Many community members joyfully remarked: Such good soil moisture is rarely seen in many years.

    新华社兰州二十八日电 甘肃省大部分地区在二十七日到二十八日八时普降雨雪。这次雨雪，在中部地区较大。岷县降雨量达到四十二毫米；临洮、定西、渭源、临夏、和政等县降雨量分别在二十七到三十二毫米之间；兰州市以及易旱的会宁、景泰、靖远、永登等县降雨量分别在十一至二十五毫米之间；其他地区降雨量在五毫米左右；河西走廊有些地区在二十八日八时后还继续降雪。
    这次雨雪，有利于春小麦和夏杂粮的播种，也有利于冬小麦的返青生长。在这以前，从三月十三日到二十七日，全省大部分地区曾普降雨雪三次。许多社员高兴地说：今年这么好的墒情，是多年少见的。
