The Red Guards Revolutionary Committee of the Three Trees Vehicle Depot of the Harbin Railway Bureau, starting from the perspective of promoting both revolution and production, streamlined overlapping organizational structures, fostered a spirit of cooperation, and allocated two-thirds of non-production personnel to the production frontline. As a result, the entire depot has seen a new face in both revolution and production.

In February, this depot completed its monthly production tasks six days ahead of schedule. The time taken for passenger car inspections was reduced from the previous seven to eight days to five and a half days, setting a new record.

During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards at this depot broke through numerous obstacles to achieve a great alliance from the bottom up, seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and establishing the Red Guards Revolutionary Committee. Following their victory in the power struggle, the Red Guards pressed on, vigorously promoting revolution and production. They thoroughly eliminated the poisonous influence of the capitalist and revisionist management practices imposed by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, abolished unreasonable old regulations, and established a new order for revolutionary production. Guided by Chairman Mao's teachings on learning new things and building a new world, and adhering to the principle of serving production, the Red Guards bravely reformed the bloated and overlapping old structures. They embodied the spirit of socialist enterprise cooperation, overcoming the past phenomenon of rigid division of labor. For example, the warehouse inspection workshop inspected cars within the depot, while the service car workshop inspected cars during their runs. Previously, each worked independently, often leading to missed inspections. Now, warehouse inspection and service car inspection are integrated. Service car inspectors, upon returning, first report the conditions encountered during the run to the warehouse inspectors and then assist in car inspections. This not only resolves issues identified during the run but also eliminates potential problems in the depot, ensuring high-quality train operations.

After streamlining the organizational structure and implementing cooperation, the number of non-production personnel in this depot was reduced from the previous 121 to 41, significantly reinforcing the production frontline.

The promotion of cooperation also effectively drove technological innovation. Previously, a three-sided planer in the carpentry group produced low-quality products, and six people found it challenging to operate. The carpentry workers had long requested a solution, but the so-called technical authorities insisted on adhering to outdated frameworks, prohibiting workers from innovating and reforming. Now, the Red Guards from the machinery repair group proactively joined forces with the Red Guards from the carpentry group. Together, they studied and designed a plan, and after half a month of effort, they successfully transformed the three-sided planer into an automated three-sided planer. This not only improved product quality but also doubled work efficiency.

    三棵树车辆段坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”方针
    精简重叠机构　发扬协作精神
    三分之二非生产人员充实生产第一线，革命生产出现新面貌
    据新华社哈尔滨十九日电　哈尔滨铁路局三棵树车辆段红色造反者革命委员会，从有利于抓革命促生产出发，精简重叠的组织机构，发扬协作精神，把三分之二的非生产人员充实到生产第一线，全段革命生产出现了新面貌。
    二月份，这个车辆段提前六天完成了全月生产任务。客车检修占线时间由过去的七、八天减少到五天半，创造了最新纪录。
    这个段的红色造反者，在文化大革命中冲破了重重阻力，实现了自下而上的大联合，一举夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，成立了红色造反者革命委员会。这个段的红色造反者取得夺权斗争的胜利后，乘胜前进，狠抓革命，猛促生产，大力清除党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在车辆段推行资本主义、修正主义企业经营管理的流毒，破除不合理的旧规章制度，建立了革命生产新秩序。红色造反者们本着毛主席关于“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的教导，本着有利生产，为生产服务的精神，勇于改革臃肿重叠的旧机构，体现了社会主义企业分工协作的精神，克服了过去那种分工如分家的现象。譬如，库检车间是在车库内检修车，乘务车间是在列车运行途中检修车，过去各自为政，常常发生漏检事故。现在库检和乘务联合为一体，乘务检车员退乘回来，首先向库检检车员叙述列车运行途中的情况，然后还帮助库检检车人员检修车辆，这样既把列车运行中途发现的问题解决了，也把中途未能发现的故障在库里排除掉，保证了列车的高质量。
    精简机构层次和实行协作后，这个段的非生产人员由过去的一百二十一人减少到四十一人，这就大大充实了生产第一线。
    由于发扬了协作精神，也有力地促进了技术革新。过去木工组的一台三面刨车床出的产品质量不高，六个人作业都挺费劲。木工组的工人们早就要求解决这个问题，可是那些技术“权威”却一口咬定洋框框破不得，不准工人革新改造。现在机修小组的红色造反者主动找木工小组的红色造反者联合起来，大家在一块研究设计方案，一起搞革新。经过半个月的努力，他们终于把这台三面刨车床革新为自动化三面刨车床，不仅提高了产品质量，还提高了工效两倍多。
