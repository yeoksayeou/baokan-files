Military families from a certain unit stationed in Hainan Island, together with ethnic Li community members, are enthusiastically participating in spring plowing.

Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, March 7th: Military families from a certain unit stationed in Hainan Island have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have taken Mao's works and farming tools to rural areas near their bases, passionately spreading Mao Zedong Thought and actively supporting revolutionary farmers in spring plowing and sowing.

The military families of this unit have paid close attention to connecting with the poor and lower-middle peasants in their base areas. Following Chairman Mao's teachings to "unite and participate in production and political activities, and improve women's economic and political status," they have gone to rural areas near their bases, working alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, sharing their class struggles, and having bitter meals together. They have received profound class education. Currently, it is the peak season for spring plowing and production. Taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, they have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have arranged their household chores and rushed to the frontline of spring plowing and production to support the poor and lower-middle peasants in their spring plowing and production.

Upon arriving in the rural areas, these military families actively spread Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They regard the fields as the best platform for spreading Mao Zedong Thought. While working, they spread Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution and promote production" and study "A Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. They also have heart-to-heart talks with the poor and lower-middle peasants, exposing the evil plots of class enemies who disrupt production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When they arrived in Li ethnic villages, many of them did not understand the Li community members' language. However, Mao Zedong Thought became their common language. The military families and community members sang Mao Zedong Thought songs together, igniting the enthusiasm of the revolutionary peasants for labor.

In supporting spring plowing and production, the military families have carried forward the spirit of the People's Liberation Army, which endures hardships and hard work. They go where the work is hardest. They get up early and work late, carrying fertilizer and planting rice seedlings with the community members, seizing the opportunity and catching the season, working with great enthusiasm. The military families' revolutionary spirit has inspired the broad masses of community members and revolutionary cadres to actively engage in spring plowing and production. They said: The People's Liberation Army, educated by Chairman Mao, cares about us the most. The military families also have hearts connected with ours. We must grasp the revolution and promote production, fire the first shot of spring plowing, and report the best results to Chairman Mao.

    海南岛驻军某部军人家属同黎族社员一起大闹春耕
    新华社海口七日电　海南岛驻军某部机关的军人家属，热烈响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，带着毛主席著作和生产工具，深入驻地农村，热情地宣传毛泽东思想，大力支援革命农民搞好春耕春种。
    海南岛驻军某部机关的军人家属，很注意联系驻地的贫下中农。她们遵照毛主席“团结起来，参加生产和政治活动，改善妇女的经济地位和政治地位”的教导，到驻地农村中去，和贫下中农共同劳动，同诉阶级苦，同吃忆苦餐，受到了深刻的阶级教育。当前，正是春耕生产大忙季节，她们以解放军为榜样，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，又安排好家务，奔赴春耕生产第一线，支援贫下中农搞好春耕生产。
    这些军人家属一到农村就积极宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。她们把田头当作传播毛泽东思想的最好阵地。她们一边劳动，一边宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，和广大贫下中农、革命干部一起学习《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，并和贫下中农亲切谈心，揭露阶级敌人破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋。她们来到黎族村庄，有许多人不懂黎族社员的语言，但是，毛泽东思想成了她们和黎族社员的共同语言。军人家属们和社员在一起，高唱毛主席语录歌，激发了广大革命农民的劳动热情。
    军人家属在支援春耕生产中，发扬了人民解放军吃大苦，耐大劳的精神，哪里活最累，她们就往哪里去。她们起早贪黑和社员一起挑肥、插秧，抢时机，赶季节，干得热火朝天。军人家属这种冲天的革命干劲，鼓舞了广大社员和革命干部搞好春耕生产的积极性，他们说：毛主席教导出来的人民解放军最关心我们，军人家属也和我们心连着心，我们一定要抓好革命，促好生产，打响春耕第一炮，用最好的成绩向毛主席他老人家汇报。
