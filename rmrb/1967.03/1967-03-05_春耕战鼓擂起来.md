The Party Central Committee's call is spreading far and wide,
The poor and lower-middle peasants are overjoyed.
Seize the revolution, promote production,
The spring ploughing drums beat loudly.

The commune's fields are teeming with people,
Competitions for fertilizing and preparing for ploughing are underway,
Hoes rise and fall, shining like silver,
Fertilizer piles rival the mountains in height.

We are all heroes,
Mountains and rivers obey our arrangements;
Sweat soaks the earth, making it fragrant,
The vast land adds luster.

In spring, let's shed a few more drops of sweat,
In summer and autumn, a golden sea will spread;
With scythes, we reap the bounty of harvest,
Let the trains and ships carry the grain day and night.

    春耕战鼓擂起来
    福建永春岵山公社一社员
    党中央号召传四方，
    贫下中农喜心怀。
    抓革命，促生产，
    春耕战鼓擂起来。
    公社田野人如潮，
    积肥备耕搞竞赛，
    锄头起落银光闪，
    肥堆与山比高矮。
    咱们都是英雄汉，
    山山水水听安排；
    汗水浸得泥土香，
    万里江山添光彩。
    春天多流几滴汗，
    夏秋一片黄金海；
    挥镰割下丰收果，
    任凭车船日夜载。
