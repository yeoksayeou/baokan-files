The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity sent a telegram on the 19th to the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) and the people of South Africa, strongly condemning the fascist rule of the South African white racists. It firmly supports the South African people's just struggle against imperialism and colonialism led by the United States, against racial oppression, and for national liberation. It also firmly supports the South African people's struggle against the betrayal of the national liberation movement by Soviet modern revisionism.

The telegram said, "On the seventh anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre, we are deeply convinced that the blood of the South African freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives in the Sharpeville incident will not be in vain. The more the imperialists and the South African reactionaries massacre the South African people, the more they will provoke the people's resistance and hasten their own doom. As the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has said: 'They are digging their own graves.' This is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. All the oppression they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people."

The telegram pointed out that the South African authorities must immediately release all the patriots who have been arrested, stop the persecution and suppression of the South African people. The telegram said, we believe that as long as the South African people strengthen their unity and carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, they will certainly be able to smash the aggression of imperialism led by the United States and the sabotage by Soviet modern revisionism, overthrow the fascist rule in South Africa, and achieve the final victory of national liberation.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, the Afro-Asian Journalists Association issued a statement on the 20th to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the Sharpeville incident, firmly supporting the people of Azania in their struggle under the leadership of the Pan-Africanist Congress against the imperialist and colonialist policies of racial discrimination and for national liberation.

	The statement expressed that the Afro-Asian Journalists Association is convinced that the people of Azania, who have the correct anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist line and are closely united with the people of Asia and Africa, will certainly achieve the final victory in their struggle.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 21st, the March issue of the organ of the Azania (South Africa) Pan-Africanist Congress, "African News and Views," published an article on the seventh anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre, saying: "We will draw courage from the names and glorious deeds of the martyrs until we achieve liberation."

	The Sharpeville incident occurred on March 21, 1960. At that time, the South African colonial authorities brutally suppressed a large demonstration by South African Africans against the "pass laws," killing more than seventy people, injuring hundreds, and arresting about twenty thousand.

	The Pan-Africanist Congress representative office in Cairo issued a news bulletin on the 21st, saying that on the seventh anniversary of this great massacre, the Pan-Africanist Congress reaffirms its firm determination to strive for liberation and independence.

    阿扎尼亚民族解放斗争一定胜利
    中国亚非团结会等表示坚决支持阿扎尼亚人民斗争
    阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会重申争取解放的坚定决心
    新华社讯　中国亚非团结委员会十九日致电阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会并南非人民，强烈谴责南非白人种族主义者的法西斯统治，坚决支持南非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义，反对种族压迫和争取民族解放的正义斗争，坚决支持南非人民反对苏联现代修正主义对民族解放运动的背叛。
    电报说，在沙佩维尔大屠杀七周年的时候，我们深信，在沙佩维尔事件中牺牲的南非自由战士的鲜血不会白流。帝国主义和南非反动派越是疯狂屠杀南非人民，就会越激起南非人民的反抗，就会越接近灭亡。正如中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    电报指出，南非当局必须立即释放一切横遭逮捕的南非爱国者，停止对南非人民的迫害和镇压。电报说，我们相信，只要南非人民加强团结，发扬革命造反精神，就一定能够粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略和苏联现代修正主义的破坏，推翻南非法西斯统治，取得民族解放的最后胜利。
    据新华社讯　亚非新闻工作者协会二十日就纪念沙佩维尔事件七周年发表声明，坚决支持阿扎尼亚人民在泛非主义者大会的领导下，反对帝国主义和殖民主义的种族歧视政策和争取民族解放的正义斗争。
    声明表示，亚非新闻工作者协会深信，具有反帝反修的正确路线，并与亚非人民紧密团结在一起的阿扎尼亚人民，在斗争中一定能取得最后胜利。
    据新华社开罗二十一日电　阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会机关刊物《非洲新闻和观点》三月号，就阿扎尼亚沙佩维尔大屠杀事件七周年发表文章说：“我们将从烈士的名字和光荣的业绩中取得勇气，一直到获得解放为止。”
    沙佩维尔事件发生在一九六○年三月二十一日。当时，南非殖民统治当局在沙佩维尔残酷镇压了南非非洲人为反对“通行证法”而举行的大示威，枪杀了七十多名非洲人，打伤了好几百人，逮捕了约两万人。
    泛非主义者大会驻开罗代表团二十一日发表新闻公报说，泛非主义者大会在这一大屠杀事件七周年的时候，重申它为争取解放和独立而努力的坚定决心。
