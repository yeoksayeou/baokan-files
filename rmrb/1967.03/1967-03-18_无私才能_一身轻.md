Title: Selflessness Leads to a Light Heart

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To lead a great revolution, we need a great party and many excellent cadres."

Revolutionary cadres are the backbone of the revolutionary cause, the bridge between the party and the masses, and the servants of the people. It is an honor to be a cadre for the revolutionary cause.

Some comrades think that being a cadre is "hard work with no rewards," working tirelessly all year round, and still "getting criticized and scolded." It's better to be an "ordinary person," neither "working hard" nor "getting scolded." Their conclusion is: "No position, light heart."

This way of thinking is obviously wrong.

To work hard for the revolution and to toil for the people is the duty of a servant of the people. This "hard work" and "toil" are beneficial to the revolution and to the people. If working hard and toiling does not bring rewards, it is because we have problems in our thinking or our methods are wrong, and we have not done things well. It is not because of the "hard work." "Hard work" and "no rewards" are not necessarily connected.

One should adopt a correct attitude towards criticism from the masses. We have done some things that are not popular, and the masses criticize us harshly. This is precisely to help us correct our mistakes and overcome our shortcomings. Revolutionary cadres should welcome criticism, not fear it, and certainly not resent it. Being brave to accept criticism and listening to it can help us improve and work better. "Fear" is unreasonable; "resentment" is even more wrong.

"Correct what is wrong, and strive for what is right" is the correct attitude a Marxist should have towards criticism from the masses. For correct criticism, we should humbly accept it; for inappropriate or inaccurate criticism, we should also be alert. "Bowing one's head to be the ox of the people." Being the "ox" of the people means being able to endure both hard work and criticism. If one can only endure hard work but not criticism, and feels wronged after hearing some inappropriate criticism, that shows a lack of the spirit of "bowing one's head to be the ox of the people."

Chairman Mao said: "Many things, if we are blind to them and lack awareness, can become our burden and hindrance." If a person's mind is controlled by "self," they will be blind to many things. Some comrades have the thought of "no position, light heart" because they are blind to the issue of being a cadre. "Fear," "resentment," "getting criticized and scolded," "light heart," they think only of themselves. How can they have a correct understanding of being a cadre? Proletarian revolutionary fighters should have a public spirit, everything for the public, and take the world as their responsibility. Thoughts like "no position, light heart" are so incompatible with the title of a proletarian revolutionary fighter!

In fact, those who carry the burden of individualism cannot advance lightly. If a revolutionary cadre does not revolutionize his soul, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and transform his worldview, the burden of individualism will be heavy. Even if he is "without position" and an "ordinary person," he will still not be "light-hearted." Only by being selfless, having an open heart, and being free from individualism can one truly be "light-hearted"!

    无私才能“一身轻”
    辛午
    毛主席教导我们：“指导伟大的革命，要有伟大的党，要有许多最好的干部。”
    革命干部，是革命事业的骨干，是党和群众之间的纽带，是人民的勤务员。为革命事业当干部是光荣的。
    有些同志认为，当干部“吃力不讨好”，终年辛辛苦苦，还要“挨整受气”；不如当个“老百姓”，既不“吃力”，又不“受气”。他们的结论是：“无官一身轻”。
    这种想法显然是错误的。
    为革命而“吃力”，为人民而辛辛苦苦，这是人民勤务员的本份。这种“吃力”，这种辛苦，对革命有利，对人民有利。如果辛辛苦苦而“不讨好”，那是因为我们思想上有毛病，或者方法不对头，没有把事情办好，决不是由于“吃力”的缘故。“吃力”和“不讨好”之间，并没有必然的联系。
    对待群众的批评，应当采取正确的态度。我们做了一些“不讨好”的事情，群众狠狠地批评我们，正是为了帮助我们改正错误，克服缺点。革命的干部应该“闻过则喜”，不应该闻过则怕，更不应该闻过则怨。勇于“闻过”，听得进批评，就有可能改过，使自己进步，工作得更好。“怕”，是没有道理的；“怨”，就更加不对了。
    “有则改之，无则加勉”，是一个马克思主义者对待群众批评应该有的正确态度。对于正确的批评，我们虚心接受；不恰当的或者与事实有出入的批评，也可以引起我们警惕。“俯首甘为孺子牛”。做人民大众的“牛”，就要既能“任劳”，又能“任怨”。如果只能“任劳”，不能“任怨”，听了一些不恰当的批评就耿耿于怀，一肚子委屈，那说明他还缺乏“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神。
    毛主席说：“有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。”一个人的头脑，如果是由“私”字掌权的话，他就会对许多事情陷入盲目性。有些同志所以会产生“无官一身轻”的思想，就是因为他们对当干部的问题陷入了一种盲目性。“怕”呀，“怨”呀，“挨整受气”呀，“一身轻”呀，想的尽是自己。他怎么能够对当干部的问题有正确认识呢？无产阶级的革命战士应当一心为公，一切为公，以天下为己任。“无官一身轻”之类的思想，同无产阶级革命战士这个称号是多么不相称啊！
    其实，身上有个人主义包袱的人是不可能轻装前进的。一个革命的干部，如果不在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，破私立公，改造世界观，个人主义包袱很重，即使“无官”，当个“老百姓”，也还是“一身轻”不了的。只有无私，胸怀坦荡，没有个人主义，才能真正“一身轻”！
