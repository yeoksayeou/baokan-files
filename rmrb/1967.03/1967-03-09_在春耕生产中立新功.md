The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued a letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes across the country. This is the greatest encouragement and care from our dearest leader, Chairman Mao, a great call to action. It is our guiding light. I wholeheartedly respond to Chairman Mao's call and will unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, fight alongside them, promote revolution, and boost production to launch the first offensive in spring plowing.

After the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat began in the countryside, some community members posted big-character posters about me. At that time, I had some knots in my mind. I thought: I work just like the community members, toiling hard for the team and doing a lot of work, but in the end, I still get criticized by the masses and have big-character posters about me. To be honest, it was hard to bear, and I didn't take the initiative to work anymore. Later, I opened the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied it. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Since we are serving the people, we should not fear criticism and correction from others." "We must believe in the masses, and we must believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, we will not be able to accomplish anything." Comparing myself with Chairman Mao's teachings, I thought again and again and found that my original thoughts were wrong. As a cadre, when I have shortcomings and mistakes, the masses post a few big-character posters, and I develop a grudge, which is not the attitude of believing in the masses and the Party. The masses criticize me to help me, trust me, so how can I feel wronged and develop a negative attitude? Isn't this against Chairman Mao's teachings?

Once my thoughts were clear, I put down my burden and felt much lighter. I then actively discussed with the revolutionary organization in the team and convened a community meeting. At the meeting, I initially reviewed my past mistakes in my work and, based on the situation that green manure did not grow well, proposed suggestions for dredging river mud and accumulating fertilizer in the spring. The community members are reasonable, and they did not dwell on my past mistakes but actively supported my suggestions, immediately launching a hot spring fertilizer accumulation campaign. In the process of accumulating fertilizer, I set an example by jumping into the river barefoot to work. The community members, seeing this, also followed one by one, and no one was willing to fall behind. By February 22, more than ten thousand loads of river mud had been carried, enough to be the base fertilizer for sixty to seventy mu of cotton or corn.

Spring plowing is here. We rural cadres must wholeheartedly respond to Chairman Mao's great call and the great call of the Party Central Committee, unite with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and actively do a good job in spring plowing, contributing our own efforts to achieve a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year!

    在春耕生产中立新功
    上海宝山县罗店公社沈家宅生产队队长　沈思中
    中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信发表了，这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席向我们发出的伟大号召，是对广大贫下中农和农村干部的最大支持和最大关怀，是我们的指路明灯。我最热烈地响应毛主席的号召，一定同贫下中农团结在一起，战斗在一起，抓革命，促生产，打响春耕生产第一炮。
    在农村无产阶级文化大革命开始后，社员贴了我一些大字报。那时，我思想上有了疙瘩。我想：自己同社员一样劳动，辛辛苦苦为队里做了不少工作，结果还落得挨群众提意见，贴大字报。说实在的，真有点受不了，工作也不主动干了。后来，我打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》来学习。毛主席教导我们：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”对照毛主席的教导，我想了又想，发现自己原来的思想不对头。我当干部，有了缺点、错误，群众贴几张大字报，便产生了埋怨情绪，这就不是相信群众、相信党的态度。群众批评我，是爱护我，帮助我，信任我，我怎么反而感到委屈，产生消极情绪呢？这不是违背了毛主席的教导吗？
    思想一通，丢掉包袱，精神上感到轻松多了。我便主动同队里的革命组织商量召开了社员大会。在会上，我初步检查了自己过去工作中的错误，同时根据绿肥长得不好的情况，提出了挑河泥、大搞春季积肥的建议。社员群众是通情达理的，他们没有计较我过去的错误，积极支持了我的建议，立即掀起了热气腾腾的春季积肥高潮。在积肥中，我以身作则，带头赤脚跳下河去干。社员们看着也一个个跟上来，谁也不甘落后。到二月二十二日为止，已挑河泥一万余担，可作六、七十亩棉花或包米的基肥。
    春耕生产已经到来了，我们农村干部一定要最热烈地响应毛主席的伟大号召，响应党中央的伟大号召，同广大贫下中农一起，团结一切可以团结的力量，积极做好春耕工作，为夺取今年农业生产的丰收贡献自己的一份力量！
