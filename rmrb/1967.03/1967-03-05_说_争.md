Title: On "Struggle"

To excel in spring farming production, we must have a spirit of "seizing the day," especially emphasizing the character "struggle."

The year's plan depends on spring. Everyone should race against time to fire the first shot of spring farming production.

Struggle for a cart of fertilizer in spring, reap a thousand pounds of grain in autumn. Without struggle, there is no gain; without labor, there is no harvest. If you fall behind by one step, you will fall behind by many steps. If you don't struggle hard in the spring, the entire year's production will be passive.

Poor and lower-middle peasants should struggle to carry the banner, struggle to offer suggestions, and struggle to complete tasks, seizing grain from the earth and striving for victories in both revolution and production.

Revolutionary cadres should quickly struggle to stand out, struggle to go to the front lines, struggle to go among the poor and lower-middle peasants, and struggle to take on heavy responsibilities.

Cadres who have made mistakes should cast aside the character "fear," be brave in revolution, and struggle to move forward, making amends for past errors.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army supporting spring farming production should all struggle to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, each person struggling to go to the most difficult places, struggling to take the lead in everything, setting an example everywhere, and forever being heart-to-heart with the people.

Comrades in the revolution, let's take action quickly!

Struggle to be pioneers in seizing the revolution, and struggle to be models in promoting production.

    说“争”
    解放军某部　刘德厚
    搞好春耕生产要有个“只争朝夕”的革命精神，特别贵在一个“争”字上。
    一年之计在于春，人人要争分夺秒，打响春耕生产第一炮。
    春争一车粪，秋得千斤粮。不争不得，不劳不获。一步跟不上，步步跟不上。春季争得不狠，全年生产就要被动。
    贫下中农要争着把大旗扛，争着出主意，争着把活干，向大地夺粮，争取革命、生产双胜利。
    革命干部要赶快争着站出来，争着到第一线，争着到贫下中农里面去，争着挑重担子。
    犯过错误的干部，要去掉“怕”字，要勇于革命，争着往前跑，将功补过。
    支援春耕生产的人民解放军广大指战员，人人争着宣传好毛泽东思想，个个争着到最困难的地方去，事事争头阵，处处做榜样，永远和人民群众心连心。
    革命的同志们，快快行动起来吧！
    争当抓革命的闯将，争当促生产的模范。
