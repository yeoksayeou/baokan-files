Our Shanghai Cotton and Textile Procurement and Supply Station has over thirty section-level cadres. In December last year, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses at our station broke through numerous obstacles and ignited a blazing fire to expose and criticize the capitalist reactionary line. At that time, we wanted to stand with the revolutionary masses and thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line. However, there were still many "fears" in the minds of us eleven comrades. A common concern was that we were in power, subjects of investigation, and our positions were different from those of the masses, so we couldn't act rashly. Because we wanted to revolutionize but were also afraid, our unit's movement was boisterous among the masses, but we cadres were cold and quiet.

In early January this year, we heard about some cadres from other places who had come out to revolutionize, which inspired us greatly. After discussing, the eleven of us voluntarily joined together to study how to come out to revolutionize. To overcome various fears, we repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" and relevant editorials from the *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily*. We came to understand that the current struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the capitalist reactionary line is a major issue of right and wrong, affecting the future of our country and the fate of the people of the world. As cadres, we must prioritize the interests of the Party and the state, abandoning all personal selfishness. At the same time, we must learn from the revolutionary youth and revolutionary factions that dare to be bold and fearless, and vigorously criticize the capitalist reactionary line to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with all our strength.

After raising our class consciousness and unifying our thinking, we wrote several big-character posters exposing how the work team and the party committee at our station implemented the capitalist reactionary line. This action received enthusiastic support from the revolutionary masses, who said we did the right thing and did it well. They also pointed out to us that we should not be satisfied with just a few big-character posters and should not be so "refined and gentle, modest and frugal." With the enlightenment and help of the comrades in the proletarian revolutionary factions, we established a combat organization.

Over the past two months, we have mainly done the following:

First, we went among the masses and, together with the revolutionary factions in our respective departments, studied the steps of the movement and jointly exposed and criticized the capitalist reactionary line. For example, after the masses exposed the work team's shielding of a party committee member and deputy director of the party committee office who had long concealed his family background, the work team still stubbornly denied it. Through our internal and external coordination, we proved it with ironclad facts and further exposed the work team's falsifying his experience, reporting to higher authorities, and preparing to promote him. The masses were greatly shocked, believing that this was "fire in the backyard, explosion in the heart, cadres truly rebelling."

Our actions caused a small group of stubborn elements who insisted on the capitalist reactionary line to panic and resent us. The work team leader regarded us as "dangerous individuals." They also spread rumors among the masses, saying that the evaluation of us cadres should be "measured," and that we would still be criticized and struggled against in the future, and so on. Our response to these obstacles was firm. On one hand, we continued to boldly expose, and on the other hand, we proactively reported to the proletarian revolutionary factions within the station the materials on how we had implemented the capitalist reactionary line in the past. For example, during a exposure meeting, when a victim of the reactionary line pointed out one of our comrades, the masses were very angry. He then voluntarily went on stage to make a confession and explained that he had already made a written exposure beforehand. This way, he gained the understanding of the masses.

Second, we supported the proletarian revolutionary factions in their struggle for power. On February 8, the proletarian revolutionary factions at our station announced the takeover of all powers in the station. We believed that this action was timely and would be more beneficial to the development of the movement and the implementation of the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Therefore, we immediately expressed our firm support to all the employees of the station. Our revolutionary actions, however, were criticized by some people with ulterior motives. Some said we were "eager to take the stage and grab a straw"; others even threatened, "You cadres should be careful," and so on. Chairman Mao taught us: "A thorough materialist is fearless. We hope that all those who struggle with us will bravely take on responsibilities, overcome difficulties, fear no setbacks, fear no criticism or ridicule, and also dare to criticize and make suggestions to us communists. 'Dare to be beheaded, dare to pull the emperor off his horse,' when we struggle for socialism and communism, we must have this fearless spirit." This further strengthened our confidence in the struggle. The members of our group all expressed that we are not afraid of difficulties and dangers and are ready to face the test of stormy waves. The revolutionary factions organized to better handle the class struggle and production struggle within the station, often proactively consulted with us on issues and sought our opinions. We also frankly put forward our thoughts and the feedback from the masses to the revolutionary factions, which helped them study and improve. This way, we further understood and trusted each other, and established a solid combat friendship in our common struggle.

Third, we did some work to achieve revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Based on the situation in our station, we frankly discussed with the revolutionary factions our views on how to implement the "three-in-one" combination. We believe that the party committee secretary at our station is both an executor and a victim of the reactionary line; during the great storm of counter-revolutionary economism, he was able to basically adhere to principles and resist the evil wind. However, his attitude towards exposing and criticizing the capitalist reactionary line and dealing with revolutionary mass organizations was somewhat wavering. Then, we participated in the work of uniting and educating him through criticism meetings, symposiums, and individual talks. He was deeply moved and said, "This is the greatest concern for me politically from my comrades." Later, in the exposure and criticism meeting, he further clarified his position and firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He also proactively did work on a part of the cadres, removing some ideological obstacles for the station to fully implement the "three-in-one" combination.

Now, all eleven of us have been accepted as members of the revolutionary factions. Through two months of struggle practice, we have felt that:

First, cadres must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out a thorough revolution in their souls, break away from selfishness, and uphold selflessness. Only by being selfless can one be bold and have a clear stance, truly breaking with the capitalist reactionary line.

Second, the process of cadres coming out to revolutionize is also the process of gradually implementing the "three-in-one" combination. Cadres must have the spirit of putting down their arrogance and becoming humble students, actively seeking the support and help of revolutionary factions, and accepting education and self-reform in the common struggle. Only by doing so can one gain the understanding and trust of the masses.

    消除顾虑坚决同革命群众站在一起
    上海针棉织品采购供应站　十一个革命干部
    我们针棉织品采购供应站共有科级干部三十多人。去年十二月份，我站无产阶级革命派和革命群众冲破了重重阻力，在站内点燃了揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的熊熊烈火。当时，我们很想与革命群众站在一起，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。但是，我们十一个同志的头脑里还存在着不少“怕”的思想。一个共同的顾虑是，自己是当权派，是受审查的对象，所处的地位与群众不同，不能轻举妄动。正由于我们当时是想革命又害怕，因此我们单位的运动，群众搞得轰轰烈烈，而我们这些干部却是冷冷清清。
    今年一月初，我们听到了一些外地干部站出来革命的情况，给我们启发很大。经过串连，我们十一个人就自愿地结合起来，研究如何站出来革命。为了克服各种“怕”的思想，我们反复学习了“老三篇”和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》有关社论，认识到当前无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的斗争，是一个大是大非的问题，是关系到我们国家的前途，世界人民命运的头等大事。作为一个干部必须以党和国家的利益为重，抛弃个人的一切私心杂念。同时，一定要学习革命小将和革命派那种“敢”字当头的大无畏精神，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线贡献一切力量。
    阶级觉悟提高、思想认识统一以后，我们就写了一些揭发我站工作队和站党委执行资产阶级反动路线的大字报。这个行动，得到了革命群众的热情支持，他们说我们做得对，做得好；同时也向我们指出，不要仅仅满足于几张大字报，不要那么“文质彬彬，温良恭俭让”。在无产阶级革命派同志的启发和帮助下，我们成立了战斗组织。
    两个月来，我们主要做了以下几件工作：
    第一，到群众中去，同所在科室的革命派组织一起研究运动步骤，一起揭发批判资产阶级反动路线。例如群众揭发了工作队包庇我站党委委员、党委办公室副主任长期隐瞒家庭成份的问题以后，工作队还是百般抵赖。经过我们内外串连，用铁的事实作了证明，并进一步揭发了工作队代其虚报经历，向上级打报告，准备提拔他的错误行为。群众震动很大，认为这是“后院起火，心脏爆炸，干部真的起来造反了”。
    我们的行动，引起了一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的恐慌和仇视，工作队长把我们看作“危险人物”。他们还在群众中煽阴风，说什么对我们这些干部的评价要有“分寸”，说对我们这些人
  “将来还要批判斗争”等等。我们对这些阻力的回答是坚定的，一方面继续大胆揭发，另一方面也主动向站内无产阶级革命派组织交代我们过去执行资产阶级反动路线的材料。例如，在一次揭发大会上，当反动路线的受害者点到了我们一个同志的名，群众很气愤时，他就主动上台作了交代，并说明了事先已作书面揭发。这样就取得了群众的谅解。
    第二，支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。我站无产阶级革命派于二月八日宣布接管全站一切权力，我们认为这样一个行动是适时的，它更有利于运动的开展，更有利于贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针。因此，我们立即向全站职工表示我们坚决拥护和支持。我们的这种革命行动却受到了一些别有用心的人的指责，有的说我们是“迫不及待粉墨登场，想捞半根稻草”；有的甚至还威胁说：“你们这些当权派要当心点”，等等。毛主席教导我们：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的，我们希望一切同我们共同奋斗的人能够勇敢地负起责任，克服困难，不要怕挫折，不要怕有人议论讥笑，也不要怕向我们共产党人提批评建议。‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”这使我们进一步坚定了斗争的信心，小组同志都表示，我们不怕艰难险阻，要迎接惊涛骇浪的考验。革命派组织为了把站里的阶级斗争、生产斗争搞得更好，经常主动地与我们商量问题，征求意见。我们也毫无拘束地把我们的想法和来自群众对革命派组织的反映坦率地提出来，便于他们研究和改进。这样我们就相互取得了进一步的了解和信任，在共同的斗争中建立起牢固的战斗友谊。
    第三，为实现革命的“三结合”做了一些工作。根据我站情况，如何实行“三结合”？我们坦率地向革命派组织谈了我们的看法。我们认为，我站党委书记既是反动路线的执行者，又受到反动路线的排挤；在大刮反革命经济主义妖风时，他基本上能够坚持原则，顶住了这股妖风。但是他在揭发批判资产阶级反动路线和对待革命群众组织的问题上，态度有点摇摆。接着，我们参与了对他进行团结教育的工作，通过批判会、座谈会和个别谈心等方法对他进行了帮助。他深受感动地说：“这是同志们对我在政治上最大的关怀。”后来他在揭发批判大会上进一步表明了态度，坚定地站到毛主席的革命路线上来。他还主动地去做了一部分干部的工作，为全站全面实行“三结合”扫除了一些思想障碍。
    现在我们十一个同志都被吸收为革命派组织的成员。通过两个月的斗争实践，我们体会到：
    第一，干部起来革命，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在灵魂深处闹革命，大破私字，大立公字。只有无私，才能“敢”字当头，立场鲜明，真正做到与资产阶级反动路线决裂。
    第二，干部起来革命的过程，也是逐步实现“三结合”的过程。干部一定要有放下架子，甘当小学生的精神，积极争取革命派的支持和帮助，在共同战斗中接受教育，改造自己，也只有这样做了，才能得到群众的了解和信任。
