The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee has organized eleven Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which have recently set out to various parts of the province to spread Mao Zedong Thought. They are using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the spring plowing battle, vigorously promoting revolution, and vigorously promoting spring agricultural production.

The members of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams were selected from revolutionary organizations at the provincial level, totaling over 500 people. They have been dispatched to nine prefectures and the suburbs of the cities of Jinan and Zibo.

Before departing, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee convened a special meeting for them. At the meeting, Wang Xiaoyu, a responsible comrade of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Yang Guofu, a responsible comrade of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jinan, and Mu Lin, a standing committee member of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, all spoke. They unanimously pointed out that the propaganda teams should hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought, unite the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the spring plowing battle. They should vigorously promote Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." They should arm the masses and cadres with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They should rely on the masses and collective strength, and channel the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses, which has been unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, into agricultural production, laying a solid foundation for achieving a bumper harvest for the entire year. In their speeches, they also emphasized the need to humbly learn from the masses, attach importance to investigation and study, first be a student of the masses, and then be a teacher of the masses; to care for the masses and seriously arrange for the masses' lives; and in agricultural production, to focus on directional and key issues.

After the meeting, the members of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams concentrated on studying Chairman Mao's works and the relevant instructions from the Central Committee on "grasp revolution, promote production." They unanimously declared that they would definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works, vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought, and fight alongside the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to achieve victory in both revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 27th: The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team organized by the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee has gone deep into more than fifty factories, mines, enterprises, and suburban rural people's communes in the city. Together with the broad revolutionary factions, they have been studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public." Many grassroots units have quickly achieved great unity within the unit and department, creating a situation of victory in both revolution and production.

The Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team consists of nearly 700 people, including cadres from the People's Liberation Army's land and naval forces stationed in Qingdao, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres. This propaganda army, formed in a "three-in-one combination" manner, has been going deep into the grassroots since late February. They have been living, working, and fighting alongside the broad revolutionary factions in workshops, fishing boats, work sites, shops, and fields. They have actively promoted Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies in various meetings and through blackboards, big-character posters, and broadcasts, playing an important role in promoting the great unity of revolutionary factions and in grasping revolution and promoting production.

The Qingdao Weaving Carpet Factory originally had three revolutionary mass organizations that were opposed to each other due to differing viewpoints. After the propaganda team entered the factory, they found that the reason for the opposition was that some leaders had wrong thoughts such as sectarianism, factionalism, and small-groupism in their minds. The team members, together with the leaders of the three organizations, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and the brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Wrong Ideas." At the same time, they vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses of the entire factory, promoting the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill, explaining the great significance of overcoming factionalism and achieving great unity of revolutionary factions within the unit and department. This quickly led to the achievement of great unity within the unit and department in the factory. The revolutionary masses of the Qingdao First Textile Accessories Factory established eight combat organizations during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Before the great unity, these combat organizations operated separately and did not communicate with each other, which was detrimental to both the revolution and production. After the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered the factory, they vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations, studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," discussing how to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, and explaining the importance of rectification for better unity against the enemy. After studying and discussing, various revolutionary mass organizations opened their doors for rectification, welcoming other revolutionary mass organizations to help them rectify, and everyone expressed their determination to firmly follow Chairman Mao's words, achieve great unity of revolutionary factions, not say anything that is detrimental to unity, and not do anything that is detrimental to unity. In this way, the entire factory quickly achieved a new situation of great unity within the unit and department.

Wherever the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team went, a new high tide of mass study and application of Chairman Mao's works surged. Under the enthusiastic help and guidance of the propaganda team, the broad revolutionary factions armed themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, significantly enhancing their revolutionary consciousness and initiative. Chairman Mao said: "The struggle of the proletariat and revolutionary people to change the world includes the task of realizing the following: changing the objective world and also changing one's subjective world." Through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the revolutionary factions of Qingdao deeply felt that to complete the struggle of seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and to carry the revolution through to the end, one must dare to make a revolution in one's soul, breaking down the self and establishing the public. Currently, in more than fifty grassroots units where the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team has been, most revolutionary mass organizations, after rectification and study, are further uniting on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the grassroots units where the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team has been, the revolution is booming, and production is thriving. The spiritual face of the revolutionary masses has been renewed, and good people and good deeds are emerging in large numbers. The broad revolutionary masses have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," with sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm, vigorously promoting the revolution, and vigorously promoting production, continuously reporting the good news of overfulfilling the state plan. After achieving great unity, hundreds of fishing boats from the Qingdao Marine Fisheries Company rushed to the sea to catch fish. After achieving great unity within the unit and department, the Qingdao Weaving Carpet Factory increased the number of operating looms from the original 80% to 100% in seven days, increasing production by 5.4%, and the quality of the products has also improved compared to before.

    山东革命委员会组织宣传队分赴省内各地
    大力宣传毛泽东思想
    青岛市毛泽东思想宣传团深入基层
    新华社济南二十七日电　山东省革命委员会组织的十一个毛泽东思想宣传队，已在最近出发到全省各地宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指挥春耕战斗，狠抓革命，猛促春耕生产。
    毛泽东思想宣传队的人员，是从省级机关各革命组织中抽调的，共五百多人。他们分赴全省九个专区和济南、淄博两个市的郊区。
    宣传队出发前，省革命委员会把他们集中起来专门召开了一次会议。会上，省革命委员会负责人王效禹同志，人民解放军驻济南部队负责人杨国夫同志，省革命委员会常委穆林同志，都讲了话。他们一致指出，宣传队要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力宣传毛泽东思想，团结广大贫下中农和革命干部，用毛泽东思想指挥春耕战斗。要大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装群众，武装干部。要依靠群众，依靠集体力量，把广大革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的积极性，用到农业生产中去，为争取全年农业大丰收打下坚实的基础。他们在讲话中还要求大家一定要虚心向群众学习，重视调查研究，先做群众的学生，后做群众的先生；一定要关心群众，认真地安排群众生活；在农业生产上，一定要注意抓方向性的问题，抓关键性的问题。
    会后，参加毛泽东思想宣传队的人员集中学习了毛主席著作和中央关于抓革命、促生产的有关指示，他们一致表示：一定要活学活用毛主席著作，大力宣传毛泽东思想，同广大革命群众和革命干部一起战斗，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    据新华社济南二十七日电　青岛市革命委员会组织的毛泽东思想宣传团，深入全市五十多个厂矿企业和郊区农村人民公社，同广大的革命派一道，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，使许多基层单位的无产阶级革命派迅速实现了按单位、按部门的大联合，出现了革命、生产双胜利的大好局面。
    青岛市革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传团，由人民解放军驻青岛陆、海军部队的干部以及革命学生和革命干部近七百人组成。这支以“三结合”形式组成的毛泽东思想宣传大军，从二月下旬开始，深入基层，在车间、渔船、作业场地和商店里，在田野上，同广大革命派生活在一起，劳动在一起，战斗在一起。他们在各种会议上，并且利用黑板报、大字报、广播等形式，积极宣传毛泽东思想和党的方针政策，同革命群众一道在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，对于推动革命派的大联合以及抓革命、促生产，起了重要作用。
    青岛市织毯厂原来有三个革命群众组织，彼此之间由于观点不同，互相对立。宣传团进厂后，了解到这些组织所以对立，是因为一些负责人的头脑中存在着风头主义、宗派主义、小团体主义等错误思想。宣传团的成员带着这些问题，同三个组织的负责人一起反复学习毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作；同时向全厂革命群众大张旗鼓地宣传毛泽东思想，宣传贵阳棉纺厂的经验，说明克服小团体主义，实现无产阶级革命派按单位、按部门大联合的伟大意义，使这个厂的革命派较快地实现了按单位、按部门的大联合。青岛第一纺织配件厂的革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中成立了八个战斗组织。大联合前这些战斗组织分兵把口，互不通气，对革命和生产都很不利。毛泽东思想宣传团进厂后，大力宣传毛泽东思想，同各革命群众组织负责人一道学习“老三篇”，讨论怎样才算“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，并向他们说明整风是为了更好地团结对敌的道理。经过学习和讨论，各革命群众组织纷纷开门整风，互相贴大字报欢迎其他革命群众组织帮助自己整风，大家表示要坚决听毛主席的话，搞好革命派大联合，不利于团结的话不说，不利于团结的事不做。这样，全厂很快出现了按单位、按部门大联合的新局面。
    毛泽东思想宣传团所到之处，群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的运动就掀起了新的高潮。在宣传团的热情帮助和辅导下，广大无产阶级革命派用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑，革命的自觉性和积极性有了很大提高。毛主席说：“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界”。青岛市的无产阶级革命派通过活学活用毛主席著作，深深体会到，要胜利完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，将革命进行到底，必须敢于在自己的灵魂深处闹革命，破私立公。目前，毛泽东思想宣传团所到的五十多个基层单位的大部分革命群众组织，经过整风学习，都正在毛泽东思想的基础上进一步联合起来。
    毛泽东思想宣传团所到的这些基层单位，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产也搞得热气腾腾，革命群众的精神面貌焕然一新，好人好事大量涌现。广大革命群众坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以冲天的革命干劲狠抓革命，猛促生产，不断传出超额完成国家计划的喜讯。青岛市海洋渔业公司广大革命职工实现大联合后，数百艘渔船争先出海捕鱼。青岛市织毯厂按单位、按部门大联合后的七天里，开车台数从原来的百分之八十增加到百分之百，产量增加了百分之五点四，产品质量也比以前有了提高。
