	Chairman Mao's works have been warmly welcomed by the people of Norway.

	The manager of a bookstore in Oslo, Mrs. Ester Bergli, recently said: Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Norwegian people's love for Chairman Mao Zedong's works has been growing. She said, we have never sold so many copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (five-volume Norwegian edition) before; every day new customers come to buy the "Little Red Book" of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Orders for this little red book are pouring in from all over the country like snowflakes.

	Mrs. Bergli said: It is heartening to see that young people are particularly fond of reading Mao Zedong's works. We often have large groups of young people here, all wanting to buy "Quotations from Chairman Mao" or the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." She said, the young people have almost bought out our stock of single-volume editions such as "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" and "To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing."

    毛主席著作在挪威受到热烈欢迎
    新华社讯　奥斯陆消息：毛主席著作受到挪威人民的热烈欢迎。
    奥斯陆一家书店的经理爱丝特·贝格律夫人最近说：自从中国无产阶级文化大革命以来，挪威人民热爱毛泽东主席著作的感情不断增长。她说，我们过去从来没有出售过这么多的《毛泽东选集》（挪威文版五卷本）；每天都有新的顾客来购买被称为“小红书”的《毛主席语录》，购买这种小红书的订购单从全国各地象雪片一样飞来。
    贝格律夫人说：令人高兴的是，青年人非常喜欢读毛泽东的著作，我们这里经常挤着大群的青年人，他们要买《毛主席语录》或《毛泽东选集》。她说，青年们把我们库存的《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》等单行本都几乎买光了。
