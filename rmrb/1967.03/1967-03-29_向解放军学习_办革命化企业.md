Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have decided that the People's Liberation Army will actively assist local areas and support industrial production. This is the great leader Mao Zedong's warm concern for us revolutionary workers. This decision is exactly what we revolutionary leftists want. We welcome it a thousand times and support it ten thousand times!

Based on our personal experience, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's decision is very timely and wise! It is a strategic decision of great significance for carrying out the Cultural Revolution, promoting industrial production, and building socialist enterprises.

Following the great leader Mao Zedong's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses, the Shanxi Provincial Military Region has given us tremendous support. In late January, when a small clique of capitalist-roaders in our factory colluded with reactionary forces to launch a frenzied persecution against us, and we rose up to seize power from them, the Shanxi Provincial Military Region and the garrison troops gave us strong support. In early February, when the class enemies launched a fierce counterattack and production was seriously affected, the Shanxi Provincial Military Region again organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to help us consolidate our leadership and achieve victory in both revolution and production. In more than a month, they have made outstanding contributions to our factory's Cultural Revolution and production.

They helped us smash the class enemies' fierce counterattack, dismantle reactionary organizations, and educate and win over the misled masses.

They helped us deeply expose and criticize the capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, basically overthrowing, overthrowing, and exposing the class enemies.

They helped us achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses and launched a widespread and in-depth rectification movement.

They helped us implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy, establishing a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ.

They helped us reverse the production decline caused by the class enemies' sabotage, making the entire factory's production flourish. Some workshops and teams have already created the highest production records since the factory was established.

In short, the PLA comrades have helped us establish a good order for production and the Cultural Revolution, ensuring that the proletarian revolutionary masses firmly grasp the leadership.

In more than a month, we have achieved such great results quickly and well, fundamentally because the PLA comrades have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized politics, and helped us arm the broad masses of workers with Mao Zedong Thought. This has greatly advanced us in the ideological transformation of the enterprise. This was the greatest help the PLA comrades gave us in the previous stage. In the future, we will mainly learn from the PLA comrades in these aspects.

After the proletarian revolutionary masses seize power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they face the question of which path to take. Should we follow the old path and manage the enterprise as before, or should we advance along the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao?

We know that the Cultural Revolution is not just about "removing officials" or overthrowing a few revisionist counter-revolutionaries to declare the revolution a success. The fundamental task of this great revolutionary movement is to prevent and combat revisionism, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and thoroughly smash the foundation of revisionist counter-revolutionaries. For an enterprise, it is not just about exposing and overthrowing the capitalist-roaders within the Party; it is also about thoroughly uprooting the capitalist and revisionist enterprise management lines and establishing Chairman Mao's enterprise management line.

If the proletarian revolutionary masses do not thoroughly break with the capitalist and revisionist enterprise management lines after seizing power, but instead follow the old path, step by step, then the task of the Cultural Revolution cannot be thoroughly completed, and revisionist counter-revolutionaries will still emerge. Only by advancing along the new line that conforms to Mao Zedong Thought can we achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution, consolidate the achievements of the Cultural Revolution, and ensure that the enterprise will never change color.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." To build a good socialist enterprise, we must emphasize proletarian politics, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, implement the "four firsts," cultivate the "three-eight" style, and promote the ideological transformation of the people. In this regard, the People's Liberation Army is our best example to learn from.

Under the control of a small clique of capitalist-roaders in the former Party Committee, our factory did not emphasize proletarian politics or do ideological work for the people. Instead, it relied on material incentives. They not only did not organize workers to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works but also maliciously attacked the active learners of Chairman Mao's works, Comrade Xueyue. The revisionist enterprise management line poisoned the souls of the workers, making a factory with first-class modern equipment lag behind in production for a long time.

As soon as the PLA comrades arrived at our factory, they set a good example of emphasizing politics. They insisted on using revolution to lead production and using revolution to promote production. They seized every opportunity to organize workers to learn Chairman Mao's works, arm the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and educate the misled masses with Mao Zedong Thought. They helped us fight against the capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ringleaders of reactionary organizations. They organized some misled workers to recall bitterness and think of sweetness. They "used one key to open one lock," doing meticulous ideological work. Now, they are also helping us set up evening schools to learn Chairman Mao's works, helping us open reading rooms, and establish clubs to occupy various fields with Mao Zedong Thought.

After this period of work, the entire factory has launched a wave of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the spiritual face of the broad masses of workers has been completely renewed. The ideological awareness and policy level of the revolutionary masses have greatly improved. Most of the misled masses who participated in reactionary organizations have already transformed themselves organizationally, ideologically, and emotionally, standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The workers' style has also changed significantly. For example, our factory used to have a saying: "Meetings start at seven, arrive at eight, and reports start at nine." Now, under the PLA's decisive style, everyone can arrive on time for meetings and start on time. Some units and workers who were originally considered old and backward in our factory have also become active. Why? Because the PLA comrades mastered Mao Zedong Thought and knew how to do ideological work for the people. Under the guidance and help of the PLA comrades, we proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres also pay more attention to ideological and political work.

Chairman Mao often teaches us: Cadres should participate in production labor, and cadres should maintain broad, constant, and close contact with the masses. This is also the fundamental principle of managing a socialist enterprise. Not only should cadres be educated to have such awareness, but in organizational structure and regulations, this principle should be ensured to be implemented.

Under the control of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the situation in the Taiyuan Textile Factory was the opposite. For example, workers worked in three shifts, but the cadres at the factory and workshop levels all worked the day shift. These two levels of cadres did not follow the shifts for production management and ideological work, let alone participate in labor.

After the PLA comrades came to our factory, the cadres and soldiers followed the workers in three shifts for labor, study, and life. Recently, they have also helped us reform the organizational structure and management methods, abolishing the workshop level and implementing a one-line management method for each shift. This reform is the unanimous demand of the broad masses of workers, but some cadres only listed some specific business difficulties and did not support this reform. Later, it was the responsible comrades from the army who educated them: When discussing management system issues, we must also emphasize politics. How to benefit cadres participating in labor, how to benefit cadres maintaining close contact with the masses, how to benefit doing ideological and political work, how to benefit reducing non-production personnel, and how to benefit production, we should do it that way. We should not first consider our own convenience. In this way, everyone's understanding was unified. As for the so-called contradictions and difficulties in specific work, they can all be smoothly solved through strengthening ideological and political work and improving work methods.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team sent by the Shanxi Provincial Military Region has given us a lot of help politically and ideologically. Now, they are also discussing with us and have put forward the slogan of building the Taiyuan Textile Factory into a revolutionary enterprise and a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. We are fully confident that with the help of the PLA comrades, we will thoroughly reform the Taiyuan Textile Factory, sweep away all capitalist and revisionist things, and let Mao Zedong Thought firmly take root here and guide everything.

Chairman Mao calls on the whole country to learn from the PLA. This time, we have the opportunity to learn directly from the PLA. We must seize this great opportunity to learn well from the PLA comrades.

    向解放军学习　办革命化企业
    太原纺织厂红卫队
    毛主席、党中央决定，人民解放军大力协助地方，支持工业生产工作。这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们革命职工的亲切关怀。这个决定正合我们无产阶级革命派的心意，我们一千个欢迎，一万个拥护！
    根据我们的亲身体验，毛主席、党中央的这个决定，太适时了，太英明了！这是搞好无产阶级文化大革命，促进工业生产大发展，办好社会主义企业具有伟大战略意义的英明决策！
    遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的指示，山西省军区给了我们极大的支援。一月下旬，当我们厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结反动势力向我们进行疯狂迫害，我们奋起向他们夺权的时候，山西省军区和驻军部队给了我们强有力的支持。二月上旬，当阶级敌人猖狂反扑，生产遭受严重危害的时候，山西省军区又组织毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助我们巩固领导权，争取革命和生产双胜利。这一个多月的时间，他们对我们厂的文化革命和生产做出了出色的贡献。
    他们帮助我们粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，瓦解了反动组织，把受蒙蔽的群众教育和争取过来。
    他们帮助我们对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线进行了深刻的揭发和批判，把阶级敌人基本上斗倒斗垮斗臭了。
    他们帮助我们实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合，并且展开了广泛深入的整风运动。
    他们帮助我们贯彻执行了毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，建立了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。
    他们帮助我们扭转了因阶级敌人破坏而造成的生产下降的局势，使全厂生产蒸蒸日上，有的工段、班组已经创造了建厂以来的最高纪录。
    总之一句话，解放军同志已经帮助我们建立了生产和文化大革命的良好秩序，使无产阶级革命派稳固地掌握住领导权。
    一个多月来，我们所以能又快又好地取得这么大的成绩，从根本上讲，是因为解放军同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，帮助我们用毛泽东思想来武装广大职工的头脑，因而使我们在思想革命化和企业革命化方面大大前进了一步。这是前一阶段，解放军同志对我们的最大的帮助。今后，我们向解放军同志学习，主要也是学习这些方面。
    无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权以后，就面临着一个按什么路子往前走的问题。是踩着旧的脚印，按照旧的办企业的老路往前走呢，还是按照毛主席指引的革命道路前进呢？
    我们知道，无产阶级文化大革命决不是什么“罢官革命”，决不是打倒几个反革命修正主义分子就算革命成功。这场伟大革命运动的根本任务，是反修防修，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，彻底摧毁反革命修正主义的基础。从一个企业来讲，就不仅要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来斗倒斗垮斗臭，而且要彻底挖掉资本主义、修正主义的办企业的路线，确立毛主席的办企业的路线。
    无产阶级革命派夺权以后，如果不同资本主义、修正主义的办企业的路线彻底决裂，而是沿袭旧路，亦步亦趋，那末，无产阶级文化大革命的任务就不能彻底完成，反革命修正主义分子还会产生出来。只有按照新的符合毛泽东思想的办企业的路线前进，才能取得文化大革命的彻底胜利，才能巩固文化大革命的成果，保证企业永不变色。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”要办好社会主义企业，就要突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，实行“四个第一”，培养三八作风，促进人的思想革命化。在这一方面，人民解放军是我们最好的学习榜样。
    我们厂在前党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控制下，根本不突出无产阶级政治，不做人的思想工作，而是靠物质刺激办事。他们不仅不组织职工活学活用毛主席著作，反而对学习毛主席著作积极分子解悦同志进行了恶意的打击。修正主义的办企业的路线，毒害着职工的灵魂，使一个拥有第一流现代化设备的企业，生产长期处于落后状态。
    解放军同志一到我们厂，就为我们做出了突出政治的好榜样。他们坚持以革命统帅生产，以革命带动生产。他们抓紧一切时间，组织职工学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装革命派，用毛泽东思想教育受蒙蔽的群众。他们帮助我们斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和反动组织中的首恶分子。他们组织一些受蒙蔽的职工忆苦思甜。他们“一把钥匙开一把锁”，深入细致地做思想工作。现在，他们还正帮助我们筹办学习毛主席著作的业余学校，帮助我们开辟阅览室，建立俱乐部，用毛泽东思想占领各个领域。
    经过这一段的工作，全厂掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，广大职工的精神面貌焕然一新。革命派的思想觉悟和政策水平有很大提高。参加过反动组织的受蒙蔽的群众，大部分已经从组织上、思想上、感情上转变过来，站到毛主席的革命路线一边。职工的作风也有显著变化。举个小例子：过去我们厂流行着一句话：“七点开会，八点到，九点误不了听报告。”现在，在解放军雷厉风行的作风带动下，大家也能准时到会，准时开会了。一些原来在我们厂的干部看来，是老落后、不好教育的单位和工人，也积极起来了。为什么？就因为解放军同志掌握了毛泽东思想，会做人的工作。在解放军同志的带动和帮助下，我们无产阶级革命派和革命的领导干部，也更注意做思想政治工作了。
    毛主席经常教导我们：干部要参加生产劳动，干部要同群众保持广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这也是办社会主义企业的根本原则。不仅要教育干部有这样的自觉，而且在组织机构、规章制度方面要保证这个原则的贯彻执行。
    在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派控制下的太原纺织厂，情况恰恰相反。例如，工人是三班生产，而厂一级、车间一级的干部却都是上白班。这两级干部既不跟班从事生产管理和做思想政治工作，当然更谈不到跟班参加劳动。
    解放军同志到我们厂来以后，干部、战士分三班跟随工人同劳动，同学习，同生活。最近，他们又在帮助我们改革组织机构和管理方法，取消车间一级，实行按轮班一条龙的管理方法。这种改革，是广大工人的一致要求，可是有的干部尽是列举一些具体业务上的困难，不赞成这种改革。后来，还是部队的负责同志教育他们：讨论管理体制问题，也要突出政治。怎么样有利于干部参加劳动，有利于干部密切联系群众，有利于做思想政治工作，有利于减少脱产人员，有利于生产，就应当怎么办。而不应当首先考虑自己的工作怎么样方便。这样，大家才统一了认识。至于具体工作中的所谓矛盾和困难，通过加强思想政治工作和改进工作方法，都可以圆满解决。
    山西省军区派到我们工厂来的毛泽东思想宣传队，从政治上思想上给了我们许许多多的帮助。现在，他们又跟我们商量，提出了把太原纺织厂办成革命化企业，办成毛泽东思想大学校的响亮口号。我们完全有信心，在解放军同志帮助下，使太纺来个彻底改造，把资本主义、修正主义的东西统统扫地出门，让毛泽东思想在我们这里牢牢扎根，统帅一切。
    毛主席号召全国学习解放军，我们这次有了直接向解放军学习的机会。我们一定要抓住这个大好时机，向解放军同志好好学习。
