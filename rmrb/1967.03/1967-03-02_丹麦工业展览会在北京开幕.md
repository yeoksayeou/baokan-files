Thorsen praised the achievements of the People's Republic of China since its founding. He said that the Danish people have a deep impression of the achievements of the Chinese people.

Lu Xiuzhang also spoke at the opening ceremony. He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'All countries and peoples in the world that oppose imperialism are our friends.' The Chinese people have been, are, and will continue to be willing to engage in friendly cooperation with the peoples of all countries and develop economic and trade exchanges with each other."

Lu Xiuzhang said that our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved one great victory after another. With the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our country's industrial and agricultural production will definitely see a new, comprehensive leap forward. He pointed out that as long as both China and Denmark make efforts, the prospects for trade between the two countries are promising.

In his speech, the Danish Ambassador to China, Orlborg, expressed his belief that this exhibition will further promote the development of trade between Denmark and China and further enhance the friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

Tonight, Ambassador Orlborg will host a banquet to celebrate the opening of the Danish Industrial Exhibition. Yesterday evening, Lu Xiuzhang held a reception to celebrate the opening of the Danish Industrial Exhibition.
