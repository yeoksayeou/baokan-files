Revolution Creates New Horizons, Production Technology Makes Great Strides

Anshan Iron and Steel New Product - 25-Meter Long Rails Mark China's Rail Production Technology Entering the World's Advanced Ranks

People's Daily reports: During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Recently, they produced the first batch of 25-meter long rails for the country. This marks that China's rail production technology has entered the world's advanced ranks.

The batch production of 25-meter long rails is of great significance to China's railway construction. It not only extends the life of railways, saves a large amount of steel and investment, but also increases the speed of train operation and improves the railway transportation capacity.

Previously, China had never produced 25-meter long rails, lacking both equipment and technical data. However, the revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "breaking superstitions and liberating thoughts," bravely undertook this production task. The workers of the Dalian Crane Factory overcame numerous difficulties to manufacture four 35-ton four-magnetic disc electric cranes to support Anshan Iron and Steel in producing 25-meter long rails. The revolutionary workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill brought "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the site, studied diligently, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide production. The revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel overcame one difficulty after another and finally produced the first batch of 25-meter long rails for the motherland.

    革命创造新天地　生产技术大发展
    鞍钢新产品——二十五米长钢轨
    标志我国钢轨生产技术进入世界先进行列
    本报讯　鞍钢革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，最近为国家生产出我国第一批二十五米长钢轨。它标志着我国钢轨生产技术已经进入世界先进行列。
    二十五米长钢轨成批投入生产，对我国铁路建设有重要意义。它不但能延长铁路寿命，节约大量钢材和投资，还能提高火车运行速度，提高铁路运输能力。
    我国过去从未生产过二十五米长钢轨，既没有设备，又缺技术资料。但是，鞍钢革命职工遵循毛主席的“破除迷信，解放思想”的教导，勇敢地担起了这项生产任务。大连起重机器厂的职工，为了支援鞍钢生产二十五米长钢轨，克服了重重困难，赶制出四台三十五吨重四磁盘电磁起重机。鞍钢大型轧钢厂的革命职工，把《毛主席语录》带进现场，抓紧时间学习，用毛泽东思想指导生产。鞍钢广大革命职工攻破了一道道难关，终于为祖国生产出第一批二十五米长钢轨。
