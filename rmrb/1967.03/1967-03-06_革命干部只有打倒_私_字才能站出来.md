In the stage of great unity among the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the decisive battle to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, it is necessary to overcome various obstacles in the minds of cadres to achieve genuine "three-in-one combination."

Currently, cadres face a severe test: can they, in the sharp struggle between the two classes and the two lines, use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to consciously and continually reform their worldviews?

Many cadres who have made general mistakes hesitate and dare not stand up. One of their concerns is: "I have made mistakes; will the masses still trust me?" They dare not go to the masses, fearing rejection, fearing that others will call them opportunists. These concerns are manifestations of the bourgeois worldview in their minds. If they do not reform, they will not pass the test of socialism.

We must believe in the masses, believe that the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought can distinguish between enemies and ourselves, judge who are the power-holders taking the capitalist road and who are the proletarian power-holders. Believe that the masses can well grasp Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the patient." Even if the masses do not trust you for the time being, as long as you truly make up your mind, recognize your mistakes, correct your shortcomings, and prove with actual actions that you stand on Chairman Mao's side, the masses will definitely trust you and support you in the end.

Another concern is: fearing that after standing up and participating in the struggle, they might make more mistakes, leading to "errors compounded and crimes piled up," thus having the idea of "preferring to remain a third-category cadre rather than sliding into the fourth category." Those who hold this attitude are not determined to correct their mistakes. In essence, they are afraid of the revolution, protecting themselves, and it is the bourgeois worldview that is at work. We say, as long as you truly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, accept the help of the masses, correct your mistakes, and make amends in the torrent of the mass movement, that is the true appearance. You will not "pile up crimes," and the masses are reasonable and will welcome cadres to come forward.

In summary, the process of cadres standing up is the process of struggling against the "self." True revolutionary cadres must undergo the test of the mass movement; must study and apply the "Three Articles" actively, thoroughly reform the bourgeois worldview, and sweep the "self" out of their minds.

However, it must be pointed out that some cadres, because of their mistakes, not only do not repent but also come to the erroneous conclusion that "being a cadre is dangerous," and thus lie down and do nothing. This behavior of shirking responsibility is criminal and absolutely not allowed. It must also be pointed out that some erring cadres, because of certain shortcomings and mistakes of the revolutionary youngsters, feel wronged, complain, and even develop serious resistance. They refuse to reform their worldviews, refuse to accept the criticism of the masses, and even turn around to attack the revolutionary masses. If so, the nature of their contradictions with the party and the masses will gradually change from non-antagonistic contradictions to antagonistic contradictions, making themselves "incurable."

All revolutionary cadres must respond to Chairman Mao's call, make up their minds, eliminate concerns, and bravely go to the masses, be with the masses, promote the "three-in-one combination," hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for the great historical task of achieving great unity among the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party!

    革命干部只有打倒“私”字才能站出来

    在无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的决战阶段，要实现真正的“三结合”，必须克服目前干部思想里的种种障碍。
    当前，广大干部面临的一场严峻考验：能否在当前两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争中，用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，自觉地不断地改造自己的世界观。
    不少犯了一般错误的干部，因为顾虑重重，不敢站出来。其顾虑之一：我犯了错误，群众还会信任我吗？他们不敢到群众中去，怕吃“闭门羹”，怕别人说自己投机。这些顾虑正是他们头脑中的资产阶级世界观的表现，若不改造，则过不了社会主义这一关。
    我们应当相信群众，相信用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众能分清敌我，辨别谁是走资本主义道路的当权派，谁是无产阶级当权派。相信群众能够很好地掌握毛主席的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的政策。即使群众一时还不信任你，但只要你真正下定决心，认识错误，改正缺点，用实际行动证明你是站在毛主席这一边，则群众最后一定会信任你、支持你。
    顾虑之二：怕站出来、参加斗争以后，再犯错误，会“错上加错，罪上加罪”，因而有“宁保三类（干部），决不滑向四类”的想法。持这种态度的人不是决心改正错误的，说穿了，就是怕革命，保自己，还是资产阶级世界观在作怪。我们说，只要你真正站到毛主席革命路线一边，照毛主席的指示办事，只要你接受群众的帮助，改正错误，在群众运动的洪流中立功赎罪，那才是真正的亮相，决不会“罪上加罪”，群众是通情达理的，是会欢迎干部出来亮相的。
    总之，干部站出来的过程，就是自己同“私”字作斗争的过程。真正的革命干部，必须经受群众运动的考验；必须活学活用“老三篇”，彻底改造资产阶级世界观，把“私”字从自己的头脑里扫出去。
    但必须指出，有的干部，因犯了错误，非但不知悔改，反而得出“当干部危险”等谬论，因而躺倒不干。这种撂挑子的行为是犯罪的，是绝对不允许的。另外也必须指出，有的犯错误的干部，因为革命小将的某些缺点错误而产生委屈、抱怨，甚至产生严重的抵触情绪。“而拒绝改造自己的世界观，拒绝接受群众对自己的批评，甚至掉转头来打击革命群众。如果那样，他们同党和群众矛盾的性质，就会逐步地起变化，从非对抗性的矛盾转化为对抗性的矛盾，使自己‘达到不可救药的地步’。”
    一切革命干部，必须响应毛主席的号召，当机立断，消除顾虑，勇敢地到群众里面去，和群众在一起，促进“三结合”，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为实现无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的伟大历史任务而奋斗！
