The People's Liberation Army of China is the great army personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao, a highly proletarianized and combat-ready revolutionary force that has stood the test of time.

During the revolutionary wars, this great army, under the command of our great leader Chairman Mao, fought its way across the country, winning a great victory for the working people. After the founding of the nation, this great army has made immortal contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and has made great contributions to the world revolution!

In the great proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world, this great people's army responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad revolutionary leftist masses, making outstanding contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The People's Liberation Army is a pillar of proletarian dictatorship and a strong backing for the proletarian revolutionaries. With the support of the PLA, the proletarian revolutionaries can overcome all obstacles and achieve all victories. In the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, the PLA is a reliable guarantee for the revolutionaries to seize power well, hold power well, use power well, and establish a new revolutionary order.

"Learn from the PLA!" This is the great call issued by our great leader Chairman Mao to the people of the entire nation. The PLA listens to Chairman Mao's words the most, loves to read Chairman Mao's books the most, and carries out Chairman Mao's instructions the most resolutely. The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" brings the PLA's practice of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the revolutionary masses. It brings the spirit of the "three-eight style" and the experience of the "four firsts" to the revolutionary masses.

The proletarian revolutionaries must seriously learn from the PLA. They should, like the PLA, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and serve the people wholeheartedly; they should, like the PLA, carry forward the "three-eight style," strictly observe the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention, and strengthen revolutionary organization and discipline; they should, like the PLA, dare to struggle and dare to make revolution, be good at struggling and be good at making revolution; they should, like the PLA, be ruthless to the enemy and lenient to oneself, unite the majority of the masses and the majority of the cadres in the struggle, and isolate and strike at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. In short, we should, like the PLA, be forever loyal to the party, loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Learning from the PLA is of great significance in overcoming the bourgeois ideologies of sectarianism, factionalism, careerism, and anarchism within the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries.

The attitude towards the PLA is a matter of principle, direction, and stance, and is an important marker distinguishing revolutionaries from non-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries.

The proletarian revolutionaries are the ones who believe in the PLA the most, love the PLA the most, and support the PLA the most, while all class enemies have always feared and hated the PLA. They are terrified of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" with military cadres participating and will use every trick to create chaos, attempting to sabotage the "three-in-one combination" and sow discord between the proletarian revolutionaries and the PLA, plotting to direct the struggle's spearhead towards the PLA. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The proletarian revolutionaries must be vigilant, thoroughly expose the class enemies' tricks, resolutely implement the "three-in-one combination," resolutely stand with the PLA, jointly defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Learn from the PLA! Salute the PLA!

    革命派最拥护解放军
    学军
    中国人民解放军是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的，是一支久经考验的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命军队。
    在革命战争的年代里，这支伟大的军队，在我们伟大统帅毛主席指挥下，转战南北，打出了一个劳动人民的江山。在建国以后，这支伟大的军队又为社会主义革命和社会主义建设立下了不朽的功勋，为世界革命做出了伟大的贡献！
    在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命中，这支伟大的人民军队又响应毛主席提出的人民解放军要积极支持革命左派广大群众的伟大号召，为无产阶级文化大革命做出了杰出的贡献。
    人民解放军是无产阶级专政的强大柱石，是无产阶级革命派坚强的后盾。有了解放军的支持，无产阶级革命派就能无坚不摧，无攻不克。在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争中，人民解放军是革命派夺好权、掌好权、用好权和建立革命新秩序的可靠保证。
    向解放军学习！这是我们伟大的领袖毛主席向全国人民发出的伟大号召。解放军最听毛主席的话，最爱读毛主席的书，最坚决地照毛主席的指示办事。革命的“三结合”使解放军把活学活用毛主席著作带到革命群众中去。把三八作风、“四个第一”的经验带到革命群众中去。
    无产阶级革命派必须认真地向解放军学习。应当象解放军那样高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全心全意为人民服务；应当象解放军那样发扬三八作风，坚决执行三大纪律八项注意，加强革命的组织性、纪律性；应当象解放军那样，敢于斗争、敢于革命，善于斗争、善于革命；应当象解放军那样对敌狠，对己和，在斗争中团结大多数群众、团结大多数干部，孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。总之，我们应当象解放军那样，永远忠于党、忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    学习解放军，对于克服无产阶级革命派队伍中的宗派主义、小团体主义、风头主义、无政府主义等资产阶级思潮有着极为重大的意义。
    对待解放军的态度，是一个原则问题、方向问题、立场问题，是区分革命、不革命与反革命的重要标志。
    无产阶级革命派是最相信解放军、最热爱解放军、最拥护解放军的，而一切阶级敌人从来就害怕解放军、仇视解放军。他们对于有军队干部参加的革命的“三结合”，怕得要死，千方百计地耍阴谋，制造混乱，妄图破坏“三结合”，挑拨无产阶级革命派和解放军的关系，阴谋把斗争的矛头指向解放军。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”无产阶级革命派，一定要提高警惕，彻底揭穿阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，坚决实行“三结合”，坚决同解放军站在一起，共同捍卫毛泽东思想、捍卫毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！向解放军学习！向解放军致敬！
