The people of Mali deeply love Chairman Mao. They often say, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts."

Recently, many Malian friends have obtained copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and they are all greatly inspired and encouraged. A Malian journalist who received a French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" joyfully said, "This is the most precious gift I have received in 1967." A Malian friend who had visited China, upon receiving a French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," happily said, "If we compare the revolution to a tree, then 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is the source of life for this tree."

A workshop director at the Dougabougou Sugar Factory said, "When I read 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I feel full of strength. Every sentence in this book is the truth." A Malian technician named Dramana, after receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on a Saturday night, immediately started reading it. He told others, "In this book, you can find the true revolutionary theory." He said, people who master Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of imperialism. "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has greatly inspired the people in their struggle.

In Mali, one often hears people praising Chairman Mao's words and sees their love for Chairman Mao. Not long ago, when the Chinese government's economic survey delegation visited the village of Sansanding in the Segou region, a farmer representative, Yahia Hedara, spoke at a welcoming rally, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao. He said, "I ask you to convey the respect of the Malian farmers to Chairman Mao. We know he is a very wise leader who has always helped friendly countries get rid of underdevelopment." He also said, "China is always loyal to friendship; it says what it does. For example, China has helped Mali build tobacco factories, sugar factories, textile factories, and plant sugarcane and tea trees. All of this shows that China sincerely helps Mali consolidate its independence."

Recently, two Malian teachers, after receiving the Mao badges they had long desired, held a small ceremony with their friends to wear the badges. At the ceremony, they first sang the Chinese song "The East Is Red" to praise Chairman Mao with their friends, and then proudly wore the Mao badges, fully reflecting their boundless love for Chairman Mao.

One day, a Malian worker brought a color photograph of Chairman Mao home, and his entire family and neighbors crowded into his courtyard to admire the respected Chairman Mao's photograph. Those present all said, "Greetings to Chairman Mao! Salute to Chairman Mao!" The Malian people all hope to see Chairman Mao.

A tea plantation technician working at the Kniaba Tea Plantation received a portrait of Chairman Mao and was overjoyed. He framed the photograph and decorated it with red paper, saying, "I want the people of Kniaba to see Chairman Mao's portrait. They all want to see Chairman Mao."

Recently, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has been translated into many languages and published abroad, immediately becoming a major event celebrated around the world. Revolutionary people from the five continents have welcomed it with great enthusiasm, like rain after a long drought, and are studying it.

    《毛主席语录》给革命人民巨大鼓舞和力量
    新华社巴马科电　马里人民衷心热爱毛主席，他们经常说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”。
    最近，许多马里朋友得到了《毛主席语录》，他们都感到无比的欢欣鼓舞。马里一位记者得到法文版的《毛主席语录》时兴高采烈地说：这是我在一九六七年所得到的最珍贵的礼物。一位曾经访问过中国的马里朋友在得到法文版的《毛主席语录》时，非常高兴地说：“如果把革命比作一棵树的话，那么《毛主席语录》就是这棵树的活力的源泉。”
    杜加布古糖厂的一位车间主任说：“当我阅读《毛主席语录》的时候，我就充满了力量。这本书的每一段都是真理。”一个叫德拉马纳的马里技术人员在一个星期六深夜里得到《毛主席语录》，他马上就读起来。他对人说：在这本书里可以找到真正的革命理论。他说，人们掌握了毛泽东思想，就不怕帝国主义。《毛主席语录》给了斗争中的人民以极大的鼓舞。
    在马里，经常可以听到人们赞扬毛主席的话语，看到他们热爱毛主席的情景。中国政府经济考察代表团不久前访问塞古地区的桑桑丁村的时候，这个村的一位农民代表亚希阿·赫达拉在欢迎集会上发表讲话热烈赞扬毛主席。他说：“我请你们向毛主席转达马里农民对他的敬意，我们知道他是一位非常英明的领袖，他一直帮助友好国家摆脱不发达状态。”他还说：“中国是始终忠于友谊的，它是说得到做得到。比如中国帮助马里建设卷烟厂、糖厂、纺织厂，种植甘蔗和茶树。这一切都表明中国真心诚意地帮助马里巩固独立。”
    有两位马里教师，最近在得到他们渴望已久的毛主席像章后，同他们的朋友一起举行了一个佩戴毛主席像章的小型仪式。在仪式上，他们首先同朋友们一起高唱歌颂毛主席的中国歌曲《东方红》，接着自豪地佩戴上毛主席像章，充分地反映了他们对毛主席无限热爱的心情。
    一个马里工人有一天带了一张毛主席的彩色照片回家，他的全家和邻居们都挤在他家的院子里争看敬爱的毛主席的照片。在场的人们纷纷说：向毛主席问好！向毛主席致敬！马里人都希望见到毛主席。
    在克尼巴茶树种植园工作的一位种茶技术人员得到了一张毛主席像，他高兴得不得了，他为照片做了一个镜框，并且用红纸装饰起来，他说：我要让克尼巴人民都看到毛主席像，他们非常想见毛主席。
