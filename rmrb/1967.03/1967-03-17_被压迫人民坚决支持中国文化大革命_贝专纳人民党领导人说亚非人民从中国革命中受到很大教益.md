Oppressed Peoples Resolutely Support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

Bechuanaland People's Party Leader Says Asian and African Peoples Gain Great Enlightment from the Chinese Revolution

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Cairo, Bechuanaland People's Party General Secretary Marupe and other leaders of the party highly praised the great thought of Mao Zedong and enthusiastically hailed the great proletarian cultural revolution currently being victoriously carried out in China.

Marupe told Xinhua News Agency reporters here on his way back to his country after visiting China, "During our visit to China, we made practical observations of the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, had conversations with Red Guards and other people, and finally came to the conclusion: 'The great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao is an unprecedented great event of world significance in the history of world revolution. It will certainly strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, consolidate China's socialist system. It is the best method to prevent capitalist restoration and the emergence of revisionism in China. Chairman Mao initiated this cultural revolution, making a great contribution to the anti-imperialist struggle of the oppressed peoples and the victory of world revolution.'"

Marupe said, "Imperialism pinned its hopes on the Chinese youth generation returning to capitalism in the same way as the Soviet youth generation did. But their beautiful dream has been shattered by the great proletarian cultural revolution. Therefore, they are very afraid of this revolution and maliciously curse this revolution."

Marupe continued, "As Chairman Mao said, 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' We oppressed peoples resolutely support the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, believing that this revolution is the hope for the victory of the revolutionary cause of the world's peoples. It tells us Asian and African peoples that even after we gain independence, we should still be vigilant against imperialism returning through ideological infiltration. We Asian and African peoples have gained great enlightenment from this revolution in China."

Marupe emphasized, "Whoever wants revolution should learn and apply the great thought of Mao Zedong. The thought of Mao Zedong is the best weapon to fight against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism of the Soviet Union. This has been proven in the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression."

    被压迫人民坚决支持中国文化大革命 
    贝专纳人民党领导人说亚非人民从中国革命中受到很大教益
    据新华社开罗电　贝专纳人民党总书记马鲁平和这个党的其他领导人高度赞扬伟大的毛泽东思想，热烈欢呼目前正在中国胜利进行的无产阶级文化大革命。
    马鲁平在访问中国后回国途中对这里的新华社记者说，我们在中国访问期间，对中国无产阶级文化大革命作了实际观察，同红卫兵和其他方面的人进行了交谈，最后得出的结论是：“由毛主席亲自领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，是世界革命史上从未有过的具有世界意义的伟大事件。它定将加强中国无产阶级专政，巩固中国的社会主义制度。它是防止资本主义复辟和在中国出现修正主义的最好的方法。毛主席发动这场文化革命，为被压迫人民的反帝斗争和世界革命的胜利作出了巨大贡献。”
    马鲁平说：“帝国主义把重返中国的希望，寄托在中国青年一代会象苏联青年那样和平演变上面。但是他们的美梦被无产阶级文化大革命粉碎了。因此，他们十分害怕这场革命，恶毒地诅咒这场革命。”
    马鲁平接着说：“正如毛主席所说的：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’我们被压迫人民坚决支持中国的无产阶级文化革命，认为这场革命是世界人民革命事业胜利的希望。它告诉我们亚非人民，即使在我们获得独立之后，仍然应该警惕帝国主义通过意识形态的渗透卷土重来。我们亚非人民从中国的这一场革命中受到很大的教益。”
    马鲁平强调说：“谁要想革命，谁就应该学习和运用伟大的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是同以美国为首的帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义进行斗争的最好的武器。这一点在越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争中已经得到了证明。”
