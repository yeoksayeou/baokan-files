The Liberation Army of South Vietnam's Gia Định Province launched a fierce attack on a U.S. military base in the early hours of February 26 in Phú Mỹ village, Tây Phú commune, Củ Chi district, achieving a brilliant victory.

The report said that during this intense assault, the Liberation Army's artillery fire left the U.S. and puppet forces unable to lift their heads, rendering them paralyzed and incapable of resistance from the start. After just twelve minutes of combat, the Liberation Army completely annihilated two U.S. Army companies and one puppet company, killing over 400 enemy troops, destroying 17 tanks and 2 large bulldozers, and seizing all weapons and military supplies, including three 105mm cannons.

Another report from the same news agency said that the local forces in Lâm Đồng Province intercepted U.S. invaders and South Korean mercenaries in the Trưng Nghĩa area on January 21-23 and February 1-4, killing and wounding nearly 100 U.S. invaders and South Korean mercenaries, and destroying and shooting down two helicopters.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on March 4, the Liberation Army in various parts of South Vietnam has recently been widely active, reporting numerous victories.

In Quảng Nam Province, the Liberation Army continued to fight bravely in January, killing nearly 2,500 enemy troops, most of whom were U.S. invaders. The Liberation Army also shot down 14 enemy aircraft of various types, destroyed 46 military vehicles, and helped the people demolish 19 "strategic hamlets."

The Liberation Army in Quảng Ngãi Province bravely counterattacked the large-scale "sweeping" operations launched by U.S. bandits in the northern region of Quảng Ngãi Province. On February 28, in the Cát Động area north of Quảng Ngãi City, they completely annihilated a company of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division.

In the Đê Giá District of Tây Ninh Province, the guerrilla forces and local troops defeated the "sweeping" operations launched by six battalions of U.S. and puppet forces in Hòa Khánh and Thượng Hậu Thành communes from February 16 to 18, foiling the enemy's "pacification" plot, and killing 235 enemy troops, including 70 U.S. invaders. The guerrilla forces in Hòa Khánh, Hạ Đức Lập, and Hòa Hiệp communes also launched consecutive attacks on the enemy's military bases in Bảo Tiến, Thứ Ba, and Đê Giá District from February 15 to 17, killing over 50 U.S. and puppet troops and shooting down one helicopter. Previously, the guerrilla forces and local troops in Đê Giá District had, over more than 20 days from January 13 to February 4, continuously thwarted the enemy's multiple "sweeping" operations, killing 134 enemy troops, shooting down six helicopters, and damaging four others.
