In the fierce battlefire, the heroic soldier Nguyen Van Liet lives forever. In just over a year of combat, he personally eliminated more than a hundred enemy soldiers, shedding his last drop of blood for the cause of national liberation.

In South Vietnam, people everywhere sing the praises of the heroic deeds of the liberation army soldier Nguyen Van Liet, extolling his courage in the sacred war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, his fearless fighting spirit, his unyielding resolve, and his revolutionary dedication to the cause of liberating the people of South Vietnam.

Nguyen Van Liet was born in 1948 in a tenant farmer's family in the ancient district of Gia Dinh province in South Vietnam. In May 1965, he joined the liberation army.

In his diary, Nguyen Van Liet wrote: "As long as I live, I will carry the revolution to the end, and if necessary, I will not hesitate to sacrifice my life." He faithfully fulfilled his oath and was tempered into a heroic soldier in the flames of struggle.

In battle, Nguyen Van Liet was brave and resourceful, unyielding to the end. In August 1965, during a battle in the ancient forest, Nguyen Van Liet used a submachine gun to destroy an enemy company command post and at the same time, he destroyed an enemy armored vehicle, creating the conditions for victory in the battle. In a raid on New Dong, Nguyen Van Liet and his comrades together annihilated eighty-five enemy soldiers.

Last February, Nguyen Van Liet led a reconnaissance team on a mission and was attacked by the enemy. Two of his comrades were scattered, leaving only Nguyen Van Liet, who also had an injured arm. However, he was fearless and used two hand grenades to destroy an enemy machine gun position, returning to his base victorious.

Last May 27, at night, Nguyen Van Liet and six comrades were returning to their base after completing a mission when they encountered the enemy. Nguyen Van Liet's legs were blown off by enemy shells, and he lost contact with his comrades. However, he exerted all his strength, endured the intense pain, and gripped the two remaining hand grenades in his hands, crawling through the thorny grass. Due to his severe injuries and excessive bleeding, when he crawled to a nearby empty house's underground shelter, he was already exhausted and fainted.

The next morning, two American soldiers and eight South Korean mercenaries came to search the area. At this time, the village's Aunt Seven and her daughter-in-law had just returned from outside. The enemy discovered them and immediately chased after them. Nguyen Van Liet, after dawn, crawled out of the underground shelter and happened to see that Aunt Seven had enemies following her. He immediately shouted, "Aunt, sister-in-law, quickly hide, the enemy is coming, let me deal with them!" At this moment, Aunt Seven realized that there was a soldier with both legs injured not far away. Aunt Seven hurriedly said to Nguyen Van Liet, "Child, the enemy is coming, your legs are injured, how can you deal with these bandits? Quickly hide." Nguyen Van Liet looked at the approaching enemy and firmly told Aunt Seven, "No, I still have two hands, I can deal with these dogs. Aunt, you quickly leave!" Aunt Seven had not gone far when the enemy had already arrived at the courtyard in front of the house. Nguyen Van Liet, using the door as cover, suppressed his heart's rage and decided to wait for Aunt Seven to leave before taking action to annihilate the enemy. Just at this moment, the enemy discovered blood on the ground and immediately gathered to inspect. Nguyen Van Liet saw that this was the perfect opportunity to strike, and he immediately used all his strength to support his body, throwing two hand grenades in quick succession at the enemy. Two deafening explosions followed, and the two American soldiers and eight South Korean mercenaries fell to the ground, all eliminated.

At this moment, the outstanding son of the people of South Vietnam, Nguyen Van Liet, shed his last drop of blood for the cause of liberating his own country and died a glorious death.

Nguyen Van Liet, a young heroic soldier, in just over a year of combat life, personally eliminated more than a hundred enemy soldiers, making a due contribution to the cause of liberating the South.

The people of South Vietnam, to commemorate Nguyen Van Liet's immortal achievements, posthumously awarded him the glorious title of "Brave Enemy Killer" and the First-Class Liberation Medal, and posthumously recognized him as a member of the Vietnam People's Revolutionary Party.

The shining example of Nguyen Van Liet is inspiring the people of South Vietnam to press forward bravely and strive for even greater victories!

    在战斗烈火中永生的英雄战士阮文历
    短短一年多的战斗中，他亲手消灭了一百多名敌人，为祖国的解放事业流尽了最后一滴鲜血。
    在越南南方，人们到处传颂着解放军战士阮文历的英雄事迹，赞扬他在神圣的抗美救国战争中，奋勇杀敌，宁死不屈，为越南南方人民解放事业英勇献身的革命精神。
    阮文历一九四八年出生在越南南方嘉定省古芝县的一个雇农家庭里。一九六五年五月，参加了解放军。
    阮文历在日记中写道：“活着就要将革命进行到底，必要时就不惜付出自己的生命。”他忠实地履行了自己的誓言，在斗争烈火中锻炼成为英雄的战士。
    在战斗中，阮文历勇敢机智，宁死不屈。一九六五年八月，在古眉森林进行的一次战斗中，阮文历用一支冲锋枪，消灭了敌人某连指挥所，同时击毁敌人装甲车一辆，为战斗的胜利创造了条件。在新东协的一次袭击战中，阮文历又和战友们一起，一举消灭敌人八十五名。
    去年二月，阮文历率领侦察小组去执行任务时，遭到了敌人的袭击。两个战友给打散了，只剩下阮文历一个人，而且手臂受了伤，但他仍然无所畏惧，用两颗手榴弹消灭了敌人的一个机枪火力点，胜利地返回了驻地。
    去年五月二十七日深夜，阮文历和六位战友在完成任务返回驻地途中，同敌人遭遇。阮文历的双脚被敌人的炮弹打断，同战友们失去了联系，但他竭尽全力，忍受着剧痛，握紧手中仅存的两颗手榴弹，在荆棘丛生的草地上爬行。由于他伤势严重，流血过多，当他爬到附近的一间空房子的地洞里时，已经精疲力尽，昏迷过去了。
    第二天早晨，两个美国佬和八个南朝鲜帮凶军前来搜索。这时，村上的七妈和她的儿媳妇刚好从外面回来。敌人发现她们之后，立即紧追上来。阮文历在天亮之后，从地洞里爬出来时，恰好发现七妈后面有敌人跟踪，他立刻喊道：“大妈、大嫂快躲开，敌人来了，让我来对付！”这时，七妈才发现在不远的地方伏着一个被打断双脚的战士。七妈连忙朝着阮文历说：“孩子，敌人来啦，你的双脚受伤，怎能对付这群强盗呢？赶快躲一躲。”阮文历望了望越来越近的敌人，斩钉截铁地对七妈说：“不，我还有双手，可以收拾这些狗东西。大妈，你们赶快走吧！”七妈走不远，敌人已经来到屋前的坪地上。阮文历借着门板的掩护，抑制着胸中的万丈怒火，决定等七妈走远后动手消灭这批敌人。就在这个时候，敌人发现地上有血迹，马上围拢起来观看。阮文历看到这正是杀敌的好时机，他立即用尽全力支撑着身体，接连向敌人扔出两颗手榴弹，只听见惊天动地的两声巨响，两个美国佬和八个南朝鲜帮凶军应声倒地，全部报销了。
    这时，越南南方人民的优秀儿子阮文历，为了自己祖国的解放事业，流尽了最后一滴血，光荣地牺牲了。
    阮文历，一个年轻的英雄战士，在短暂的一年多的战斗生活中，亲手消灭了一百多名敌人，为南方的解放事业作出了应有的贡献。
    越南南方人民为了表彰阮文历的不朽功绩，追授他“歼美勇士”的光荣称号和一级解放战功勋章，并追认他为越南人民革命党党员。
    阮文历的光辉榜样正鼓舞着越南南方人民勇往直前，去争取更加辉煌的胜利！
