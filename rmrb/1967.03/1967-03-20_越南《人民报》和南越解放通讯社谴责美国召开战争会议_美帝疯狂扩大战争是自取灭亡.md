Vietnam's People's Daily and the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency condemn the U.S. war conference
The U.S. imperialists' frenzied expansion of the war is suicidal

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 18th

	Vietnam's People's Daily published an editorial on the 18th, condemning the U.S. imperialists' Guam conference aimed at escalating the war of aggression in Vietnam. The editorial warns the U.S. aggressors that the path they have chosen is one of self-destruction.

	The article points out: "The U.S. ruling class is trying every means to conceal the purpose and nature of its Guam conference. However, Western newspapers have already revealed that this is a war conference discussing the escalation of the U.S. aggression against South and North Vietnam."

	The article states that the main reason for Johnson's convening of this conference is that they have suffered defeats on the battlefield. Johnson's hasty convening of this conference and his decision to replace people like Lodge prove this.

	The article continues: "On one hand, they escalate the war, and on the other, they talk about 'peace.' This is a trick that the Johnson group has always used. While preparing to convene the Guam conference, they spread rumors that they are actively continuing to 'seek peace,' but their colonialist stance has not changed at all."

	The article concludes: "The Johnson group is frantically escalating and expanding the war of aggression. We warn them that this is a path of self-destruction. We are fully prepared to counter any of their new 'escalation' measures. The military and people of South and North Vietnam are determined to fight to the end and will definitely achieve complete victory."

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 19th

	The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency recently published a commentary condemning the Johnson group's upcoming Guam conference, which aims to plot further escalation of the war of aggression in Vietnam.

	The commentary warns that the U.S. aggressors' arbitrary strengthening and expansion of the war of aggression will inevitably be met with the deserved punishment from the military and people of South Vietnam.

	The commentary states that the convening of the Guam conference proves the shameful failure of the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam and proves the extremely serious passive situation and the predicament of the aggressors.

	The commentary points out that the purpose of the Johnson group's convening of the Guam conference is to plot new schemes to escalate the war of aggression, attempting to drink poison to quench thirst and continue to struggle desperately in the dead end of the Vietnam war. At the same time, it will play more new tricks to deceive public opinion and put lipstick on the corrupt Saigon puppet group.

	The commentary concludes: "However, no matter how many times the U.S. imperialists convene the Guam conference, or any other conference in the future, they only have one way out, that is, to stop the aggression, to permanently and unconditionally stop the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to get out of South Vietnam."

    越南《人民报》和南越解放通讯社谴责美国召开战争会议
    美帝疯狂扩大战争是自取灭亡
    新华社河内十八日电　越南《人民报》十八日发表评论员文章，谴责美帝国主义召开策划加紧扩大侵越战争的关岛会议，并警告美国侵略者：它们选择的道路是自取灭亡的道路。
    文章指出：“美国统治集团千方百计企图掩盖其关岛会议的目的和性质。但是西方报纸已经透露，这是一次讨论加紧扩大美国侵略越南南方和北方战争的战争会议。”
    文章在指出约翰逊召开这次会议的原因时说，主要的原因在于他们在战场上吃了败仗。约翰逊在匆忙召开这次会议的同时，决定撤换洛奇等人就证明了这一点。
    文章接着说：“一面扩大战争，一面高谈‘和平’，这是约翰逊集团一贯的伎俩。在准备召开关岛会议的同时，他们散布谣言说，他们在积极地继续‘寻求和平’，但是他们的殖民主义立场丝毫没有改变”。
    文章最后说，约翰逊集团疯狂地加紧和扩大侵略战争。我们警告他们，这是一条自取灭亡的道路。“我们已经作好一切准备来对抗他们的任何新的‘逐步升级’措施。越南南方和北方的军民决心战斗到底，并且一定会取得完全胜利。”
    新华社河内十九日电　越南南方解放通讯社最近发表评论，谴责美国约翰逊集团即将在关岛召开会议，策划进一步扩大侵越战争的阴谋。
    评论警告说，美国侵略强盗随意加强和扩大侵略战争，必将遭到越南南方军民给予的应得惩罚。
    评论说，关岛会议的召开，证明了美国侵越战争的可耻失败，证明了侵略者的极其严重的被动和进退维谷的困境。
    评论指出，约翰逊集团召开关岛会议的目的是策划扩大侵略战争新阴谋，妄图饮鸩止渴，在侵越战争的死胡同中继续进行垂死挣扎。同时，它将玩弄更多的新的骗局来欺骗舆论，为腐败透顶的西贡傀儡集团涂脂抹粉。
    评论最后说，但是，不管美帝国主义这一次召开关岛会议，或者今后还将召开其他什么会议，它也只有一条出路，那就是停止侵略，永远地和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸，滚出越南南方。
