The American flag that had been flying over the headquarters of the U.S. European Command was lowered in a humiliating manner today. The U.S. military headquarters, which had been stationed on French soil for over a decade, was finally forced to withdraw in accordance with the French government's decision. A few days ago, General Lyman Lemnitzer, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and Commander-in-Chief of U.S. European Command, delivered a "farewell speech" at a luncheon held by the American Club in Paris. He lamented, "This is a very sad affair," and expressed his deep regret.

Last spring, the French government announced that France would withdraw from the military structures of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) starting July 1966 and ordered all military personnel, facilities, and equipment of NATO and the United States to be withdrawn from France by April of this year. This action dealt a heavy blow to U.S. hegemony in Western Europe. Consequently, the United States employed every possible trick and exerted immense pressure in an attempt to force France to retract its decision, but all efforts were in vain. Now, the various military institutions of the United States and the NATO, which were originally concentrated in France, are scattering like birds and beasts: apart from the U.S. European Command moving to West Germany, the Central European Command of NATO will close tomorrow and relocate to the Netherlands; while the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) of NATO will move to Belgium next week. The NATO, controlled by the United States, is crumbling and disintegrating.

    降下星条旗　一桩伤心事
    驻欧美军司令部灰溜溜地滚出法国
    新华社巴黎十四日电　悬挂在驻欧美军司令部旗杆上的美国星条旗，今天灰溜溜地降了下来，在法国领土曾驻了十多年的美军司令部，终于不得不按照法国政府的决定撤离法国。北大西洋集团军队总司令兼驻欧洲美军司令兰尼兹尔前几天在巴黎美国人俱乐部的午宴上发表“告别演说”时连连哀叹说，这是“一件十分伤心的事”，实在“非常遗憾”。
    去年春天，法国政府宣布：法国从一九六六年七月起退出北大西洋集团的军事机构，并且勒令这个集团和美国的军事人员、军事机构和设施在今年四月以前统统撤出法国。这一行动使美国在西欧的霸权遭到沉重的打击。因此，美国曾耍尽了一切阴谋诡计，施行了强大的压力，企图诱迫法国收回成命，但是结果完全失败。现在，美国以及美国所控制的北大西洋集团原来集中设在法国的一些军事机构，已经作鸟兽散：除驻欧美军司令部撤往西德外，北大西洋集团中欧司令部将在明天关闭，搬到荷兰去；而这个集团的总司令部——所谓欧洲盟军最高司令部，则在下星期搬到比利时去。美国控制的北大西洋集团正在七零八落，分崩离析。
