Chinese diplomatic personnel and staff at the Chinese Embassy in Albania participated in voluntary labor to build the Logjcën-Fieri railway with Albanian youth on February 23 and 24. They were warmly welcomed by the command center of the construction site and the youth volunteers.

During the labor, the Chinese comrades ate, lived, and worked together with the youth volunteers. Before leaving the construction site, the command center presented a portrait of Comrade Enver Hoxha to the Chinese comrades. The Chinese comrades also presented portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao badges to the Albanian youth.

At the farewell, the youth volunteers repeatedly shook hands and embraced the Chinese comrades, clapping and shouting slogans such as "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" and "Long live the friendship between the peoples of Albania and China!"
