A high-precision new instrument—the five-digit digital voltmeter—has recently come off the production line at the Beijing Municipal Radio Research Institute Experimental Factory and has been warmly welcomed by users.

The five-digit digital voltmeter is a new type of precision instrument that has emerged internationally in recent years. It has broad and important applications in industrial automation and national defense construction. In 1964, revolutionary workers and technical personnel at the Beijing Radio Research Institute and this factory began researching and developing this new product. However, at that time, the revisionist clique within the old Beijing Municipal Committee and a small handful of capitalists within the factory who held power viewed this research task as a means to gain political capital and pursue personal gain. Initially, they pretended to be concerned about the development of this product. Later, when the product was initially successfully trial-produced, these individuals, seeing that their goals had been achieved, no longer cared about how the product would be put into production. Many problems were left unresolved, resulting in the product being unable to come off the production line to support national construction for a long time.

On January 23 of this year, the revolutionary workers of this factory resolutely seized power from the small handful of capitalists within the party who held power. They took on the responsibility for both revolution and production. After seizing power, the revolutionary workers immediately held a special discussion on production issues. They resolutely broke away from the old system and old frameworks that were not conducive to production and established a new revolutionary order that adapted to production development. In this way, the production enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers was fully unleashed, and within a short period of time, the first batch of five-digit digital voltmeters came off the production line.

When the five-digit digital voltmeters came off the production line, the revolutionary workers, with a high sense of responsibility to the party, the state, and the people, repeatedly inspected and carefully "diagnosed" them. They did not overlook even the smallest errors until they fully met the standards.

    五位数字电压表出厂了
    北京市无线电研究所实验工厂革命派职工夺权后，广大革命职工的积极性得到充分发挥，使这种高精度新仪器很快投入生产，供应用户。
    本报讯　一种高精度的新仪器——五位数字电压表，最近在北京市无线电研究所实验工厂正式出厂，受到用户热烈欢迎。
    五位数字电压表，是近几年国际上出现的新型精密仪器，在工业生产自动化和国防建设上都有广泛的重要的用途。一九六四年，北京无线电研究所和这个工厂的革命工人、科技人员，开始钻研试制这种新产品。但是，当时旧北京市委内的修正主义集团和厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，却把这项研究任务视为捞取政治资本和追求名利的阶梯。最初，他们表面上对这种产品的研究也装出关心的样子。后来，产品初步试制成功，那些家伙眼看目的已经达到，就对产品如何投入生产不再过问，许多问题不予解决，以致产品长期未能出厂支援国家建设。
    今年一月二十三日，这个工厂的革命派职工坚决地从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权，把革命、生产的担子一起挑了起来。革命派职工在夺权之后，马上就对生产问题进行了专门讨论。他们坚决打破过去一套不利于生产的旧制度，旧框框，建立了适应生产发展的革命的新秩序。这样，广大革命职工的生产积极性得到了充分发挥，在很短的时间里，就使第一批五位数字电压表出厂了。
    五位数字电压表出厂的时候，革命派职工本着对党对国家对人民高度负责的精神，反复检验，仔细“诊断”，对于最微小的误差也不放过，直到完全合乎标准。
