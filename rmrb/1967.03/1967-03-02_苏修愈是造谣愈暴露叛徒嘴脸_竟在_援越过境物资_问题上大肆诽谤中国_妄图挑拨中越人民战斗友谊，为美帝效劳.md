The Soviet revisionists are fabricating more lies and exposing more of their traitorous faces. They are slandering China in the issue of "transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam," attempting to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and serve the U.S. imperialists.

	NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Our correspondent reports: Just as imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries are further colluding, more brazenly applying military and political pressure on the Vietnamese people, and plotting to force the Vietnamese people to surrender to the U.S. aggressors, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique recently fabricated absurd anti-Chinese rumors on the issue of transporting Soviet aid to Vietnam via China. They maliciously slander the great Chinese people, attempt to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, and cover up their traitorous faces.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership instructed their embassy in Ethiopia to publish an anti-Chinese article in the February 21 issue of "Soviet Daily News." The Soviet News Agency wrote the article titled "Beijing Betrays the Interests of the Vietnamese People." In this malicious anti-Chinese article, they fabricated lies through a so-called Soviet "expert" who recently returned from Vietnam, claiming that "the latest Soviet weapons transported via Chinese railways often disappear en route," and that "the latest Soviet military equipment, such as supersonic fighter jets, are replaced by old and outdated aircraft used by the Chinese People's Liberation Army during transport." They even slander that Chinese Red Guards "dismantled some Soviet equipment and 'forgot' to reinstall some important parts," making these equipment unusable upon arrival in Vietnam. They also accuse China of removing factory labels from Soviet military equipment, making these equipment bear Chinese characters instead of Soviet labels, and propagandizing that "the modern weapons provided to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are from China, not the Soviet Union." The Soviet News Agency then launched a tirade, attacking China for supposedly "directly betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people," and so on.

	According to a report by the United Press International, the Soviet representative in Washington provided the above malicious anti-Chinese article to American journalists on the 22nd. The United Press International used this article to stir up trouble, claiming that China is "stabbing the Vietnamese people in the back."

	On the same day, Soviet Deputy Defense Minister Grechko, in his speech at the Soviet Armed Forces Day celebration in Moscow, also maliciously slandered China for "abusing its geographical position" and "attempting to obstruct" the Soviet Union's "supply of goods to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

	It must be pointed out that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique publicly and on a large scale slandered and maligned China on the issue of "transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam" for the first time. Since last spring, they have fabricated many bizarre lies for the purpose of anti-China propaganda, secretly leaking them to Western bourgeois newspapers, which then widely disseminated them. They first slandered China for "obstructing" the transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam, then fabricated lies that China demanded the Soviet Union to pay transit fees in U.S. dollars, and later slandered China for "intercepting" Soviet aid missiles to "develop its own nuclear program," and so on. The Chinese Foreign Ministry and newspapers have repeatedly and resolutely exposed and refuted these shameless lies of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, making them increasingly embarrassed and miserable. The Soviet revisionist leadership is furious and hates the Chinese people who are high-spiritedly carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This time, they simply discarded all pretenses, came from behind the scenes to the forefront, and instructed their officials and overseas representative agencies to once again use the issue of "transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam" to launch a large-scale anti-China campaign. This is merely to defame the great People's Republic of China, sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, and cover up their vile plots of colluding with the U.S. imperialists to push the policy of "war to force peace" and "bombing to force peace" on the Vietnamese people.

	The 700 million Chinese people have always firmly sympathized with and supported the revolutionary struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people, and have mercilessly exposed the shameful deeds of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique in acting as the number one running dog of the U.S. imperialists and betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people have repeatedly solemnly declared that they will make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support the Vietnamese people to fight the sacred war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end. No matter how many absurd myths the Soviet revisionist leadership clique fabricates to slander China, they cannot damage the unshakable principles of the Chinese people, nor can they destroy the great friendship and combat unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. On the contrary, the more they fabricate lies, the more they expose their ugly traitorous faces and suffer shameful failures.

### 苏修愈是造谣愈暴露叛徒嘴脸  竟在“援越过境物资”问题上大肆诽谤中国  妄图挑拨中越人民战斗友谊，为美帝效劳

    苏修愈是造谣愈暴露叛徒嘴脸
    竟在“援越过境物资”问题上大肆诽谤中国
    妄图挑拨中越人民战斗友谊，为美帝效劳
    新华社一日讯　本社记者报道：正当帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进一步加紧勾结，空前露骨地向越南人民施加军事和政治压力，阴谋迫使越南人民向美国侵略者屈服的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团最近又在中国运输苏联援越物资问题上，大肆散布荒诞无稽的反华谰言，妄图诽谤伟大的中国人民，挑拨中越两国人民的战斗友谊，掩盖自己的叛徒嘴脸。
    苏修领导集团指使他们驻埃塞俄比亚大使馆，在二月二十一日发行的《苏联每日新闻》上，刊登苏联新闻社一篇挖空心思编写的反华材料。苏联新闻社在这篇题为《北京背叛越南人民的利益》的恶毒的反华材料中，通过一个所谓不久前从越南回国的苏联“专家”的“谈话”，胡说什么“最近经中国铁路运输的苏联最新式武器在途中经常就不见了”，“苏联最新式的军事装备——例如超音速战斗机——在运送过程中被中国当局用中华人民共和国军队采用的老式和陈旧的飞机所更换”。它甚至诽谤中国红卫兵把一些苏联装备“拆开了，而‘忘记’把一些重要的零件重新安装回去”，从而使这些装备运抵越南后“无法投入战斗”。它还诬蔑中国把苏联军事装备上的工厂商标“弄掉”，使这些装备上“出现了中国字，而不是苏联商标”，借以宣传“向越南民主共和国提供现代武器的不是苏联，而是中国”。苏联新闻社接着就此大放厥词，攻击中国所谓“直接背叛越南人民的利益”，等等。
    据美国合众国际社报道，苏联驻华盛顿的代表在二十二日把苏联新闻社的上述恶毒反华的材料，提供给了美国记者。合众国际社利用这篇材料大做文章，挑拨说中国正在给越南人民“从背后戳上一刀”。
    同一天，苏联国防部第一副部长格列奇科在莫斯科举行的苏联建军节庆祝大会上发表反华讲话，也大肆诬蔑中国“滥用地理位置”，“力图阻挠”苏联向越南民主共和国“提供货物”。
    必须指出，苏修统治集团这样公开地、大规模地在所谓“援越过境物资”问题上诽谤诬蔑中国，这还是第一次。自从去年春天以来，他们为了反华的需要，就曾别有用心地编造了许多离奇古怪的谎言，偷偷摸摸地透露给西方资产阶级报刊，并且由西方报刊出面广泛加以传播。他们始而诬蔑中国“阻挠”苏联援越物资过境，继而造谣中国要苏联用美元“支付”过境费用，随后又诽谤中国“拦截”苏联援越导弹，“用来发展自己的核计划”，等等。对于苏修叛徒集团这些无耻的谣言，我国外交部和报刊曾一再加以坚决的揭露和驳斥，这使他们狼狈不堪，日子越来越不好过。苏修领导集团对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、正在轰轰烈烈地开展无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民，咬牙切齿，恨得要命。这次，他们干脆抛掉一切伪装，从后台走到前台，指使他们的官员和驻外代表机构，再次利用“援越过境物资”问题大肆反华。这无非是为了诋毁伟大的中华人民共和国，挑拨中越两国人民的伟大团结和战斗友谊，掩盖他们同美帝密切勾结、对越南人民加紧推行“以战迫和”、“停炸诱和”的卑劣阴谋。
    七亿中国人民一向最坚决地同情和支持英雄的越南人民的革命斗争，最无情地揭露苏修领导集团充当美帝头号帮凶、出卖越南人民利益的可耻勾当。中国人民已经多次严正宣布，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，支援越南人民把神圣的抗美救国斗争进行到底。苏修领导集团不管编造多少诽谤中国的荒唐神话，丝毫不能损害中国人民的坚定不移的原则立场，也破坏不了中越两国人民的伟大的战斗友谊。相反，他们越是造谣，就越暴露出自己的丑恶的叛徒面目，就越遭到可耻的失败。
