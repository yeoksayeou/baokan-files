The Congolese (L) Western Front guerrillas are expanding their revolutionary base. They are purging puppet troops, winning the support of the masses, establishing grassroots organizations, and practicing self-reliance.

	BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) — The Belgian Communist Party's organ, the weekly "Voice of the People," recently published an article stating that the patriotic armed forces led by Muller in the western region of Congo (L) are expanding their base in the Kivu region.

	The Kivu region is about 300 miles east of the Congolese (L) capital. The armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys was ignited in January 1964. After the revolutionary flag was raised, the armed struggle quickly spread to the eastern and northern parts of Congo (L).

	The article in "Voice of the People" states that in the Kivu region, "the areas controlled by the revolutionary forces are expanding. This region is no longer limited to the triangle of Kikwit, Idiofa, and Gungu (the birthplace of Muller's uprising). Now, the patrols of various staffs under Muller's leadership have reached the banks of the Kasai River, operated near the port of Franqui, and penetrated deep into the interior of Kwango Province."

	The article points out that the guerrillas have received strong support from the broad revolutionary masses in these regions. The article states: "Countless Congolese people in these regions and neighboring regions have supplied food and provided intelligence to the guerrillas." The article states that revolutionary secret organizations have established their political, social, and propaganda committees even in the smallest villages. The article states that through the help of the revolutionary masses, the patriotic armed forces know the activities of the puppet troops.

	The article points out that the patriotic armed forces also pay attention to self-sufficiency in production. The article states that in order to avoid the revolutionary masses bearing the entire burden of food for the guerrillas, the patriotic armed forces "are trying to solve their own food supply problems—engaging in agriculture and various cooperative enterprises." They have established fishing cooperatives and built new villages in the forests.

	The article points out that in the eastern and northern regions of Congo (L), the patriotic armed forces are also very active. The article states, "In the east, along the entire shore of Lake Tanganyika, the puppet troops have been purged. The puppet troops were finally forced to leave Baraka. Revolutionary troops have advanced to the vicinity of Kabambare, Kasongo, Mwenga, and Lulinga. Revolutionary troops have occupied Kikongo." The article states that the patriotic armed forces have also recaptured Kazima. A unit of the Congolese (L) patriotic armed forces.

    刚果（利）西线游击队扩大革命根据地
    肃清傀儡军队　争取群众支持　建立基层组织　实行自力更生
    新华社二十八日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊最近发表的一篇文章说，由缪勒尔领导的爱国武装在刚果（利）西部克韦卢地区的根据地正在扩大。
    克韦卢地区在刚果（利）首都以东约三百英里。这个地区人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争烈火是在一九六四年一月点燃起来的。义旗举起以后，武装斗争迅速蔓延到刚果（利）东部和北部。
    《人民之声》周刊的文章说，在克韦卢地区，
  “革命部队控制的地区正在扩大。这一地区已经远远不限于基克韦特—伊迪奥法—贡古三角地带（那是缪勒尔起义的发源地）了。现在，缪勒尔领导下的各参谋部的巡逻队一直巡逻到开赛河畔，在弗朗基港的附近活动，并且深入到宽果省内地。”
    文章指出，游击队受到当地广大革命群众的有力支持。文章说：“这些地区以及邻近地区的无数刚果人给游击队供应粮食和提供情报。”“革命秘密组织在甚至是最小的乡村里建立了它的政治、社会和宣传委员会。”文章说，爱国武装通过革命群众的帮助，知道傀儡军队的活动情况。
    文章指出，爱国武装也注意生产自给。文章说，为了免让革命群众承担游击队的全部粮食负担，爱国武装“正设法自己解决自己的供应粮食的任务——正从事农业和各种合作事业。”他们已经成立了渔业合作社，在森林中修起了新村。
    文章指出，在刚果（利）东部和北部地区，爱国武装也很活跃。文章说，“在东部，沿着整个坦噶尼喀湖岸，已经把傀儡军肃清了。傀儡军最后被迫离开巴拉卡。革命军队进驻到卡班巴雷、卡松戈、姆温加、卢林加的附近。革命军队占领了基孔戈。”文章说，爱国武装还收复了卡齐马。刚果（利）爱国武装的一支部队。
