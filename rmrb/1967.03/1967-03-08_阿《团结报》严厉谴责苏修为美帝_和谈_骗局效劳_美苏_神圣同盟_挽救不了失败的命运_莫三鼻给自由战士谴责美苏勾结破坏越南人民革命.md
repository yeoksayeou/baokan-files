The Albanian "Unity" Newspaper severely condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership for actively serving the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception and betraying the Vietnamese people. The commentary points out that the Soviet revisionists do so because they urgently want to end the Vietnam War to facilitate their dealings with the U.S. imperialists more quickly and smoothly.

The commentary points out that recently, the U.S. imperialists have intensified their "peace talks" deception and "escalation of war," attempting to force the Vietnamese people to accept "peace talks," lay down their arms, and surrender to the U.S. invaders. The Soviet revisionists, who betray the Vietnamese people and the socialist cause, spare no effort to serve this shameful plot of the U.S. imperialists. The commentary says that the attempts of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists will never be realized. The heroic Vietnamese people have shown their revolutionary resolve. They will never lay down their arms as long as there is a single U.S. invader on Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people will fight.

The commentary says that the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys have repeatedly declared that the Vietnam War does not hinder their further "cooperation" and rapprochement with the U.S. imperialists.

The commentary points out that the alliance between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism does not indicate their strength but rather their weakness. The revolutionary peoples of all countries now recognize the dangerous nature of this counter-revolutionary alliance. This alliance absolutely cannot save the doomed fate of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The indestructible revolutionary forces of all countries will, like the lava of a volcano, reduce the "holy alliance" of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to ashes.

The New China News Agency, Khartoum, March 3rd: The Chairman of the Mozambique African National Union, Seyf Aziz Miras, said in an interview with the New China News Agency correspondent on the 2nd: "The Mozambique African National Union strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' collusion with the Soviet ruling clique to force the heroic Vietnamese people to surrender in their bandit tricks."

He said: The current plot of blackmail against the Vietnamese people by U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and British imperialism is deceitful. This is just Johnson's latest bandit trick to desperately extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle, and like all the tricks he has played before, it is doomed to fail. The U.S. imperialists and their allies and accomplices, facing the invincible resolve of the Vietnamese people, have seen their own inevitable failure. They are desperate, clutching at every straw, playing every trick, and not missing any opportunity to deceive, but their failure is inevitable. Like all dying imperialists and reactionaries of various countries, they will fail, fail continuously, until they perish.

He said: "The Mozambique African National Union supports the principles of the Vietnamese people as pointed out by Chairman Ho Chi Minh in his famous 'Call to Arms.' We know that the heroic Vietnamese revolutionary people will not be intimidated by the banditry of U.S. imperialism, nor will they be deceived by the 'bombing for peace' plot of the three countries (U.S., Soviet, Britain)." Miras finally said: "The Mozambique African National Union and the Mozambican people firmly oppose the current plot of the U.S. and Soviet to sabotage and destroy the great revolution of the Vietnamese people. We firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people, whose revolution is the revolution of all oppressed and struggling peoples in the world."

    莫三鼻给自由战士谴责美苏勾结破坏越南人民革命
    新华社地拉那五日电  阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》五日发表评论，严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团积极为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局效劳，出卖越南人民。评论指出，苏联修正主义者这样作，是由于他们迫切希望结束越南战争，以便他们更快、更顺利地同美帝国主义者进行交易。
    评论指出，最近美帝国主义者加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局和“战争升级”，妄图迫使越南人民接受“和谈”，放下武器，向美国侵略者投降。叛卖越南人民和社会主义事业的苏联修正主义者，千方百计为美帝国主义的这一无耻阴谋效劳。评论说，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的这种企图是永远也实现不了的。英雄的越南人民表现了革命的决心。他们决不会放下武器，只要在越南国土上还有一个美国侵略者，越南人民就要进行斗争。
    评论说，苏联修正主义者及其仆从多次公开声明，越南战争并不妨碍他们和美帝国主义进行进一步的“合作”和靠拢。
    评论指出，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义结成反革命同盟，这并不表明它们强大，而是表明了它们的虚弱。全世界各国革命人民现在已经认识到这个反革命同盟的危险性。这个同盟绝对挽救不了美帝国主义和苏联修正主义注定要失败的命运。各国人民不可摧毁的革命力量将象火山的岩浆一样，把美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的“神圣同盟”烧成灰烬。
    新华社喀土穆三日电  莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟主席塞伊夫·阿齐兹·米拉斯，二日在这里向新华社记者发表谈话说：“莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟强烈谴责美帝国主义勾结苏联统治集团迫使英勇的越南人民投降的强盗诡计。”
    他说：美帝国主义、苏修统治集团和英帝国主义“目前对越南人民进行讹诈的阴谋是骗不了人的。这不过是约翰逊拚命为扑灭越南人民解放斗争烈火而玩弄的最新强盗诡计，这个强盗诡计，象以往玩弄过的所有诡计一样，也是注定要失败的。美帝国主义及其盟友和同谋者，面对越南人民不可战胜的决心，已经看到他们自己面临不可避免的失败。他们感到绝望了，正在抓住每一根稻草，玩弄每一种诡计，不放过每一个可以进行欺骗的机会，但是他们的失败是必不可免的。象一切垂死的帝国主义和各国反动派一样，他们必将失败，不断失败，直到他们最后灭亡。”
    他说：“莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟支持正如胡志明主席在他的著名的‘号召书’中所指出的越南人民的原则。我们知道，英勇的越南革命人民绝不会被美帝国主义的强盗行径所吓倒，也绝不会受它们三国（美、苏、英）的‘以炸迫和’的阴谋所欺骗。”米拉斯最后说：“莫三鼻给非洲民族联盟和莫三鼻给人民，坚决反对目前美苏破坏和摧毁越南人民的大革命的阴谋。我们坚决支持英勇的越南人民，他们的革命就是全世界一切被压迫的和正在斗争的人民的革命。”
