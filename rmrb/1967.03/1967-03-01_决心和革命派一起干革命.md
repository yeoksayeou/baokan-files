On February 13, I was accepted into the revolutionary faction organization. When I excitedly received the red armband with both hands, the serious lessons of the past few months all rushed to my mind.

I admire the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction in my factory, who fear neither heaven nor earth and dare to fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who are in power. However, due to my lack of understanding of this unprecedented Cultural Revolution and my doubts about whether the revolutionary masses could lead this movement well, I adopted a wait-and-see attitude. At the same time, I was also concerned that I, as a factory-level leader, although responsible for production and technology, had made various mistakes in thought and action during the previous stage of the movement. The revolutionary masses would definitely not let me off. What would the revolutionary faction do with me? This became a major concern of mine every day.

As the movement deepened, in some large and small criticism meetings I participated in, some comrades pointed out my name on certain issues; the errors that everyone criticized, I had also committed. This intensified my inner struggle. Although I subjectively wanted to do a good job, due to the heavy burden of my thoughts, I actually found it difficult to concentrate my energy on work.

To change the passive situation at work and gain the support of the revolutionary faction organization to improve production, I approached a few leaders of the revolutionary organizations with a tentative attitude to discuss how to actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." The leaders of the "Invincible Combat Team" in my factory listened to my suggestions and expressed their support, and earnestly instructed me: "You must ensure that production is well-managed." The next day, the "Invincible Combat Team" issued a call to all revolutionary workers in the factory to learn from the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai and respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." This made me deeply feel that the proletarian revolutionary faction truly understands and implements Chairman Mao's instructions. They lead the revolutionary workers to shoulder the double burden of revolution and production; for people like me who are in power, they also provide timely encouragement and help, rather than treating all those in power with cold hostility as I had imagined. From then on, I dispelled some of my concerns and dared to approach them.

On January 20, the general command of my factory, formed by the united revolutionary organizations including the "Invincible Combat Team," clearly stated in an order after seizing power that I should be responsible for production administration, allowing only for improvement, not deterioration. They requested that revolutionary workers not come to me for trivial matters so that I could better focus on production; the production issues I had raised to them a few days earlier were also addressed in the order. This deeply moved me. However, due to the "selfish" thoughts in my mind, I did not understand the requirement of the order to only improve and not deteriorate from a revolutionary perspective, but rather worried that if production was not good, combined with the errors I had made in the previous stage of the movement, would they come to struggle against me? Therefore, I had a heavy burden on my mind.

By January 29, I reviewed the completion of the plan and found that it was very difficult to complete. However, the proletarian revolutionary faction that had seized power and other revolutionary workers, with a hundredfold confidence and a fighting posture, vigorously promoted production in the final three days of the production struggle, proposing a battle cry full of revolutionary enthusiasm: with actual actions, respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and give him old man some face! The workshop was bustling with activity, and the workers broke through one difficulty after another, finally fully exceeding the January production plan and winning a great victory in grasping revolution and promoting production. The entire factory's revolutionary workers cheered enthusiastically, and I also put down a heavy mental burden.

At this time, the editorial "On the Struggle for Power by the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction" in the third issue of the *Red Flag* magazine was published. I eagerly and repeatedly studied it, pondering over it. I sincerely welcomed its publication, and I truly heard the voice of our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao! I repeatedly asked myself: Do you want to be a person who commits errors but insists on not correcting them and is incorrigible? The answer is definitely not, absolutely not. I then asked myself: Since it is not the case and I do not want it to be, why have I been standing on the opposite side of the broad revolutionary masses, waiting to be struggled against? With this question in mind, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine. At this time, the leaders of the revolutionary faction headquarters repeatedly enlightened and helped me to solve this problem from the fundamental standpoint and perspective. After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings and with the enthusiastic help of my comrades, I finally woke up: My standpoint was wrong! I have not completely stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! At this time, I recalled the firm revolutionary stance of the revolutionary faction in the recent several criticism and struggle meetings, and their different handling of those who had committed serious errors but held different attitudes. I deeply felt that they had the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao, understood Chairman Mao's teachings the best, and could correctly implement Chairman Mao's instructions and the party's policies. Therefore, I realized that they would definitely handle my issue correctly. At the same time, I also understood that since I had made mistakes, it was entirely appropriate for the revolutionary masses to criticize me, and I should stand on the side of the revolutionary masses and criticize my mistakes together with them.

The burden was gone, and my mind was at ease. At this time, the revolutionary faction also enlightened and helped me to stand up and make a revolution. I am determined to stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in this great class struggle, and together with the revolutionary masses, fight to the death against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who are in power, and launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line; at the same time, I will diligently study Chairman Mao's works, seize the power of the "selfish" thoughts in my mind, thoroughly transform my worldview, and become a strong proletarian revolutionary, dedicating everything to the party and the people.

    决心和革命派一起干革命
    原青岛国棉九厂副厂长　李春霆
    二月十三日，我被接受加入了革命派组织。当我激动地用双手接过红袖章的时候，几个月来的事情，一个个严重的教训，一齐涌向心头。
    我厂的无产阶级革命派，天不怕，地不怕，敢于同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争的革命精神，我是很佩服的。但由于我对这场史无前例的文化大革命很不理解，对革命群众是否能搞好这场运动有疑问，便采取了观望态度。同时，我还顾虑自己是一个厂级的当权派，虽然负责生产技术工作，但是在前段运动中，思想上和行动上都犯有不同程度的错误，革命群众一定不会放过我。究竟革命派要怎样对待我呢？成了我每天都在思考的大事。
    随着运动的深入发展，在我参加的一些大、小批判会上，有的同志在某些问题上点了我的名；大家批判的某些错误我也犯过。这样，就加剧了我的思想斗争。尽管我主观上也想搞好工作，但由于自己的思想负担很重，实际上很难把精力集中用到工作中去。
    为了改变工作上的被动局面，取得革命派组织的支持，把生产搞好，我以试探的心情找了几个革命组织的负责人，交谈了如何积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。我厂“全无敌战斗兵团”的负责人，听了我的建议，表示支持，还恳切地嘱咐我：“一定要把生产抓好。”第二天，“全无敌战斗兵团”就向全厂革命职工发出了学习上海无产阶级革命派，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的倡议书。这使我深深感到，无产阶级革命派是真正领会和贯彻毛主席指示的，他们领导革命职工挑起了革命和生产两副重担；对我这样的当权派，也及时给予鼓励和帮助，而不是象我想象的那样，横眉冷对一切当权派。从此我解除了一些顾虑，敢于和他们接触了。
    一月二十日，我厂由“全无敌战斗兵团”等革命组织大联合组成的总司令部，在夺权后的通令中，明确指出要我负责生产行政工作，只准搞好，不准搞坏。要求革命职工不要为一般问题来找我，以便我更好地抓好生产；前几天我向他们提出来的生产中的问题，通令中也提出了解决的办法。这些使我很受感动。但是，由于头脑里“私”字作怪，我对通令中只准搞好不准搞坏的要求，不是从革命的利益出发去理解，而是忧虑一旦搞不好，再加上我前段运动中所犯的错误，是不是会来斗争我，因此思想上有负担。
    到了一月二十九日，我检查了一下完成计划的情况，认为要完成计划是非常困难的。但是，掌了大权的无产阶级革命派和其他革命职工，在最后三天的生产斗争中，以百倍的信心和战斗的姿态狠促生产，提出了充满革命豪情的战斗口号：以实际行动响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，给他老人家争气！车间里热气腾腾，职工们攻破了一个又一个的难关，终于全面超额完成了一月份的生产计划，夺得了一个抓革命、促生产的大胜利。全厂革命职工热情地欢呼，我也从思想上放下了一个大包袱。
    就在这个时候，《红旗》杂志第三期社论《论无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争》发表了。我如饥似渴地反复学习它，琢磨它。我由衷地欢呼它的发表，我真切地听到了最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的声音！我反复地问自己：你是不是、愿意不愿意成为一个犯了错误而又坚持不改和累教不改的人呢？回答当然不是，根本不愿意。我又问自己：既然不是，又不愿意，那为什么一直站在与广大革命群众相对立的方面，去等着挨斗呢？我带着这个问题，反复学习毛主席的有关指示和《红旗》杂志的社论。这时，革命派总司令部的负责人，多次启发和帮助我，要我从根本立场、观点上去解决这个问题。经过反复学习毛主席的教导，和同志们的热情帮助，我终于猛醒过来：我的立场错了！我还没有完全站在毛主席的革命路线一边！这时我又回想到在最近几次批判斗争大会上，革命派所表现的坚定的革命立场，和对待那些犯有严重错误但持有不同态度的人所采取的不同的处理，深深感到他们对毛主席的感情最深，最懂得毛主席的教导，最能正确地贯彻执行毛主席的指示和党的方针政策。因此我认识到，应当相信他们一定会正确对待我的问题。同时也明白了，自己既然犯了错误，革命群众起来批判也完全应该，自己要站在革命群众一边，和他们一起批判自己的错误才对。
    包袱丢掉了，心情舒畅了。这时，革命派又启发、帮助我站出来闹革命。我决心要在这场阶级大搏斗中，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，和革命群众一起，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作殊死的斗争，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火；同时，我要勤奋地学习毛主席著作，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，彻底改造自己的世界观，做一个坚强的无产阶级革命派，为党和人民贡献我的一切。
