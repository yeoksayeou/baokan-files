The "three-in-one" Revolutionary and Production Command Headquarters of Huai'an County, Hebei Province, has firmly responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have personally gone to the front lines of spring ploughing to lead production, receiving a warm welcome from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The entire county is buzzing with activity, presenting a great and prosperous scene.

The Revolutionary and Production Command Headquarters of Huai'an County was established in mid-February by representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, local garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres. After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural Areas Across the Country," they immediately convened a county-wide rally to promote revolution and production. They called on the entire county to hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to grasp revolution with a sense of urgency, to promote production vigorously, and to strive for a double harvest in both revolution and production.

The comrades of the headquarters organized more than 230 military officers and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses to go deep into the grassroots. They helped communes to hold three-level cadre meetings and assisted production brigades and teams to hold community meetings and to establish production leadership teams. The comrades of the headquarters and the troops lived, ate, and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studying Chairman Mao's works together. They organized commune and brigade cadres to study the editorial from the fourth issue of 1967 of the "Red Flag" magazine. Some cadres who had made minor mistakes were previously hesitant and burdened, but now they have liberated their minds, put down their burdens, and have come forward to lead production, determined to make amends in the spring ploughing and production.

Under the leadership of the Revolutionary and Production Command Headquarters and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Huai'an County are full of vigor and enthusiasm, with attendance rates generally increasing. The county has four types of fields (garden fields, terrace fields, paddy fields, and step fields) with a total of 130,000 mu, and this year plans to build another 130,000 mu. So far, 114,000 mu have been completed. In Li Xintun Commune, Huangjiazhuang Production Brigade, there are six elderly poor peasants over 70 years old. After studying the letter from the Central Committee, they were moved and said, "Chairman Mao cares so much about us, we must strive to be old but strong, and be like the old fool of the mountains." They voluntarily participated in the river improvement project. In Dukuobao Commune, Xipingshan Production Brigade, after studying the letter from the Central Committee, the poor and lower-middle peasants, despite the fact that people, livestock, and vehicles were busy with water conservancy projects, decided not to delay agricultural work. Twelve poor and lower-middle peasant community members pulled the plow to level the land, completing 275 mu in three days.

    怀安县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部组织人员深入基层
    到春耕第一线领导生产
    广大贫下中农热烈欢迎，全县热气腾腾，一片大好形势
    本报讯　河北省怀安县“三结合”抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，亲临春耕生产第一线领导生产，受到广大贫下中农热烈欢迎。全县春耕生产热气腾腾，出现一片大好形势。
    怀安县抓革命促生产第一线指挥部是由革命群众组织负责人、人民解放军当地驻军代表、革命领导干部在二月中旬组成的。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表以后，他们立即召开了全县抓革命，促生产誓师大会，号召全县人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，狠抓革命，猛促生产，誓夺革命、生产双丰收。
    指挥部的同志们，组织驻军干部战士、革命干部和革命群众共二百三十多人，深入基层，帮助公社开好三级干部会，到生产大队和生产队帮助开好社员大会和健全生产领导班子。指挥部和部队的同志们和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，一起学习毛主席著作。他们组织社队干部学习《红旗》杂志一九六七年第四期社论。一些犯过一般性错误的社队干部，原来“怕”字当头，现在解放了思想，放下了包袱，纷纷站出来领导生产，决心在春耕生产中将功补过。渡口堡公社景家山大队的妇女主任王金花，原来撂了挑子，不出勤，学习了党的政策以后，心明眼亮，当晚就挨门串户地发动了三十六名妇女，第二天一早便下地劳动。
    怀安县的春耕生产，在抓革命促生产第一线指挥部的领导下，在人民解放军的大力支援下，广大贫下中农意气风发，出勤率普遍提高。全县四田（园田、台田、坑田、梯田）建设原有十三万亩，今年计划再建设十三万亩，现已完成十一万四千多亩。李信屯公社黄家庄大队有六个七十多岁的老贫农，学了党中央的信以后，激动地说：“毛主席他老人家这样关心咱，咱们一定要做到人老心壮，当个老愚公。”他们主动地参加了改修河道工程。渡口堡公社西坪山大队的贫下中农学习了党中央的信以后，在人、畜、车辆忙于水利建设的情况下，为了不误农时，由十二个贫下中农社员拉耙耱地，三天就耱了二百七十五亩。
