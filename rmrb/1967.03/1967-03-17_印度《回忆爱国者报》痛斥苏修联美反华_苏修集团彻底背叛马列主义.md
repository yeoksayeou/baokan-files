    The Indian weekly "Recollect the Patriot" published in Punjab issued a commentary on March 20, saying: "The Soviet leaders insist on their anti-Marxist, anti-Leninist 'peace,' 'peaceful coexistence,' and anti-China policies, and collude with imperialists, thereby betraying Marxism-Leninism."

    The commentary, which condemns Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin's recent trip to London, points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership pursues an anti-Marxist-Leninist policy of capitulation to imperialism, helping U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Vietnam.

    The commentary says that after Kosygin, together with the British government, helped the United States to promote the "bomb to coerce" and "bomb to deceive" schemes, "the U.S. imperialists intensified their air, sea, and ground wars in Vietnam."

    The commentary strongly condemns Kosygin for taking the opportunity of his visit to Britain to shamelessly slander the great socialist China.

    The commentary points out that the Soviet revisionist clique has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, abandoned the path of communism, and taken the road of revisionism and capitalism, increasingly colluding with U.S. imperialism.

    The commentary points out that because the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is of great significance in preventing capitalist restoration, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been ceaselessly slandering and abusing China. The commentary says that recently, Soviet publications have even surpassed bourgeois newspapers in opposing and slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is a thoroughgoing act of serving imperialist interests.

    The commentary warns the Soviet revisionist leadership not to deceive the Soviet people any longer.

    The commentary says: "The Soviet people, who have inherited the great revolutionary tradition, will rise up to eliminate the Soviet revisionists, just as they eliminated the tsar and the tsarist regime."

    The commentary also condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership for blatantly praising the Indian reactionaries who cruelly oppress the Indian people and for providing them with various forms of assistance.

    The commentary says that the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of Marxism-Leninism has reached its extreme.

    印度《回忆爱国者报》痛斥苏修联美反华
    苏修集团彻底背叛马列主义
    新华社十四日讯　新德里消息：印度旁遮普周刊《回忆爱国者报》二十日发表社论说：“苏联领导人坚持他们的反马克思主义、反列宁主义的‘和平’、‘和平共处’和敌视中国的政策，并同帝国主义者加紧勾结，从而背叛了马克思列宁主义。”
    这篇谴责苏联修正主义的头目之一柯西金最近的伦敦之行的社论指出，苏修领导集团奉行反马克思列宁主义的投降帝国主义的政策，帮助了美帝国主义在越南的侵略战争。
    社论说，就在柯西金同英国政府一起帮助美国推销“以炸迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋以后，“美帝国主义者就加强了他们在越南进行的空中、海上和地面战争”。
    社论强烈谴责柯西金利用访问英国的机会放肆地污蔑伟大的社会主义中国。
    社论指出，苏修集团背叛了马克思列宁主义，放弃了共产主义的道路，走上了修正主义、资本主义道路，同美帝国主义日益加紧勾结。
    社论指出，由于中国无产阶级文化大革命对防止资本主义复辟有着重大的意义，因此，苏联修正主义领导集团无休止地诽谤和谩骂中国。社论说，最近苏联报刊在反对和诽谤中国文化大革命方面甚至超过了资产阶级报纸，这是彻头彻尾的为帝国主义利益效劳的行径。
    社论警告苏联修正主义领导集团不要再愚弄苏联人民。
    社论说：“继承了伟大的革命传统的苏联人民将起来消灭苏联修正主义者，就象当年他们消灭沙皇和沙皇政权一样。”
    社论还谴责了苏修领导集团大肆吹捧残酷压榨印度人民的印度反动派，并且给他们各种援助。
    社论说，苏修集团对马克思列宁主义的背叛已经达到极点了。
