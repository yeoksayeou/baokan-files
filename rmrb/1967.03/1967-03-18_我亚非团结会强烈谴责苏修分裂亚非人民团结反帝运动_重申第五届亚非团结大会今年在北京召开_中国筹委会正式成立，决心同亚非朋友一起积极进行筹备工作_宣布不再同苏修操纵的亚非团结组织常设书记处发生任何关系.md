The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Association strongly condemns the Soviet revisionists for manipulating the illegal Eighth Afro-Asian Solidarity Council meeting held in Nicosia, which openly split the Afro-Asian people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement. The statement reaffirms that the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference will be held in Beijing this year and announces the formal establishment of the Chinese Preparatory Committee. The statement also declares that it will no longer have any relations with the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization's Secretariat in Cairo, which is controlled by the Soviet revisionists.

New China News Agency, March 17th: The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee issued a statement today, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionists for manipulating the illegal Eighth Afro-Asian Solidarity Council meeting held in Nicosia, which openly split the Afro-Asian people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement. The statement reaffirms that the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference will be held in Beijing this year and announces the formal establishment of the Chinese Preparatory Committee. The statement also declares that it will no longer have any relations with the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization's Secretariat in Cairo, which is controlled by the Soviet revisionists.

The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Soviet revisionists manipulated the illegal Eighth Afro-Asian Solidarity Council meeting held in Nicosia, ignoring the strong opposition from many member organizations and the revolutionary people of Afro-Asia, and arbitrarily overturned the resolution of the 1965 Winnipeg Conference to hold the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing in 1967. They arrogantly decided to hold a fake Fifth Conference in Algiers. Thus, the Soviet revisionists have openly split the Afro-Asian people's solidarity anti-imperialist movement, tearing off all their masks and exposing their counter-revolutionary faces in broad daylight.

The Soviet revisionists have infiltrated the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement, consistently pursuing a counter-revolutionary line of fake anti-imperialism, true surrender, fake support, true betrayal, fake unity, and true division. They have done countless evil deeds. In this meeting, they have reached the stage of desperate struggles and resorting to any means. They used this illegal meeting to stage a counter-revolutionary, anti-people, and anti-China farce; they made this meeting take on a hypocritical posture of "supporting Vietnam" to cover up their dual purpose of promoting the "peace talks" conspiracy for the U.S. imperialists and splitting the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement; they also organized traitors and collaborators, pulling in a group of people while excluding and attacking the revolutionary faction; they even called in the police to intimidate the revolutionary representatives at the meeting, implementing fascist dictatorship. This is absolutely intolerable to the people of Afro-Asia.

To achieve their split plot, the Soviet revisionists wildly slandered and attacked China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong during the conference. However, "a tiny insect cannot shake a great tree." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is shaking the world, is inspiring the oppressed nations and peoples to rebel, overthrowing imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly shining in people's hearts, illuminating the path of struggle for the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all revolutionary peoples, guiding the people of the world towards complete liberation. Even at this split and anti-China meeting manipulated by the Soviet revisionists, representatives from the South West Africa People's Organization, Botswana People's Party, Swaziland Progressive Party, and Basutoland Congress Party, inspired by the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, sternly denounced the Soviet revisionists' split crimes and resolutely withdrew from the meeting. They held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and expressed the common aspiration of the people of Afro-Asia: "We want to go to Beijing to attend the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference. We long to see Chairman Mao!"

The Chinese people pay revolutionary greetings to the fearless and brave African freedom fighters!

The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee reaffirms the statement made on February 3rd: The Chinese people will not disappoint the aspirations of the people of Afro-Asia and will definitely hold the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference in Beijing in 1967. We solemnly declare: The Chinese Preparatory Committee for the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference has been formally established; it will work together with friends from all countries who uphold the line of solidarity and anti-imperialist revolution to prepare for the Fifth Conference. The Chinese people warmly welcome friends from various countries of Afro-Asia to come to Beijing, the world's anti-imperialist fortress, to work together to make the Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference a revolutionary, combative, united, and victorious conference.

It must be pointed out that the current Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization Secretariat in Cairo is under the control of the Soviet revisionists, and the correct proposals of the secretaries from various countries who uphold the line of solidarity and anti-imperialist revolution have long been brutally suppressed. The Secretariat has actually become a tool for the Soviet revisionists to carry out their counter-revolutionary line. Therefore, we declare that we will no longer have any relations with it.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed the October Revolution and consistently sabotaged the national liberation movements of the people of Afro-Asia, acting as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. They are now splitting away from the Afro-Asian people's solidarity movement to further serve U.S. imperialism and betray the cause of Afro-Asian people's solidarity and anti-imperialism. Removing this Soviet revisionist cancer will make the cause of Afro-Asian people's solidarity and anti-imperialism even healthier and more vigorous. "Thousands of sails pass by the wrecked ship, and a thousand trees bloom in front of the withered tree." A new and truly reflective Afro-Asian people's solidarity and anti-imperialist movement that reflects the revolutionary aspirations of the people of Afro-Asia will definitely emerge. Let the new tsars of the Kremlin, who are terrified of the Afro-Asian people's solidarity and anti-imperialist cause, howl and tremble!

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "People of the world, unite! Defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! People of the world, be brave, dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and press on. Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed." Currently, Asia and Africa are full of inspiring battle scenes; the revolutionary peoples of the two continents are rising up, regrouping their forces, and advancing rapidly towards the path of independence and liberation. They will, with the force of a surging tide and the power of thunder, launch a powerful assault on imperialism and old and new colonialism, modern revisionism, and all ghosts and monsters led by the United States, and will ultimately bury them all. A radiant new Asia and new Africa will appear on the horizon. The Fifth Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference to be held in Beijing is the rallying call for the people of Afro-Asia to achieve new victories. All those in Afro-Asia who want independence and liberation, unite! Form a true and broadest anti-U.S. united front, and strive for our great common goal!

    我亚非团结会强烈谴责苏修分裂亚非人民团结反帝运动
    重申第五届亚非团结大会今年在北京召开
    中国筹委会正式成立，决心同亚非朋友一起积极进行筹备工作
    宣布不再同苏修操纵的亚非团结组织常设书记处发生任何关系
    新华社十七日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者操纵在尼科西亚举行的非法的第八届亚非团结理事会会议，公开分裂亚非人民团结反帝s运动的罪行。声明重申今年将在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会，并宣布中国筹备委员会已正式成立。声明还宣布今后不再同苏修操纵的开罗亚非人民团结组织常设书记处发生任何关系。
    声明的全文如下：
    苏联修正主义者操纵在尼科西亚举行的非法的第八届亚非团结理事会会议，不顾理事会许多成员组织和亚非革命人民的强烈反对，悍然推翻了一九六五年温尼巴大会关于一九六七年在北京举行第五届亚非人民团结大会的决议，并专横地决定在阿尔及尔召开伪五届大会。这样，苏联修正主义者就公开分裂了亚非人民团结反帝运动，撕下了一切假面具，把它的反革命面目赤裸裸地暴露在光天化日之下。
    苏联修正主义者钻进亚非人民团结运动，一贯推行假反帝、真投降、假支持、真出卖、假团结、真分裂的反革命路线，干尽了坏事。在这次会议上，更达到垂死挣扎、不择手段的地步。他们利用这次非法会议，导演了一幕反革命、反人民、反华的丑剧；他们使这个会议作出“支持越南”的伪君子姿态，掩盖其为美帝推销“和谈”阴谋和分裂亚非人民团结运动的双重目的；他们还在组织上招降纳叛，拉拢一批人，同时排斥和打击革命派；甚至把警察叫进会场，恫吓与会的革命代表，实行法西斯专政。这是亚非人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    苏联修正主义者为了篡改五届大会会址，实现其分裂阴谋，在会议期间疯狂诬蔑和攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命和伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。但是，“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命，正在鼓舞着被压迫民族和被压迫人民起来造反，打倒帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派。光焰无际的毛泽东思想日益深入人心，它照亮了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和一切革命人民的斗争道路，指导着世界人民走向彻底的解放。就在这次苏修一手操纵的分裂的反华会议上，西南非洲民族联盟、贝专纳人民党、斯威士兰进步党、巴苏陀兰大会党等组织的代表，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，义正词严地痛斥了苏修的分裂罪行，毅然退出会议。他们高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，说出了亚非人民的共同愿望：“我们要到北京去参加第五届亚非人民团结大会，我们渴望见到毛主席！”
    中国人民向不畏强暴、敢于斗争的非洲自由战士致以革命的敬礼！
    中国亚非团结委员会重申今年二月三日的声明：中国人民决不辜负亚非人民的愿望，决心于一九六七年在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结大会。我们郑重宣布：第五届亚非人民团结大会中国筹备委员会已正式成立；它将和一切维护团结反帝革命路线的各国朋友一道，进行第五届大会的筹备工作。中国人民热烈欢迎亚非各国朋友到世界反帝的堡垒北京来，共同努力，把第五届亚非人民团结大会开成一个革命的、战斗的、团结的、胜利的大会。
    必须指出：目前设在开罗的亚非人民团结组织常设书记处已处于苏联修正主义者的操纵之下，维护团结反帝革命路线和主持正义的各国书记的正确主张长期遭到蛮横压制，书记处实际上已经沦为苏修执行其反革命路线的御用工具。因此，我们声明今后不再同它发生任何关系。
    苏联修正主义领导集团背叛了十月革命，一贯破坏亚非人民的民族解放运动，充当美帝国主义的头号帮凶。它现在从亚非人民团结运动中分裂出去，正是为了进一步为美帝国主义效劳，出卖亚非人民的团结反帝事业。把苏修这个毒瘤挖掉，亚非人民的团结反帝事业必将更加健康、更加蓬勃地向前发展。“沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春”。一个崭新的、真正反映亚非人民革命愿望的团结反帝运动必将出现。让对亚非人民团结反帝事业怕得要死的克里姆林宫的新沙皇们去嚎叫，去发抖吧！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”目前，亚洲和非洲到处是一片鼓舞人心的战斗景象；两大洲的革命人民正在奋起，重新结集力量，朝着独立和解放的道路迅跑。他们必将以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，向着以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义、现代修正主义和一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈冲击，并将最后把它们统统葬入坟墓。一个光芒四射的新亚洲、新非洲必将出现在地平线上。将在北京举行的第五届亚非人民团结大会正是亚非人民夺取新的胜利的进军号。亚非一切要独立、要解放的人们，团结起来，结成真实的最广泛的反美统一战线，为实现我们伟大的共同目标而奋斗！
