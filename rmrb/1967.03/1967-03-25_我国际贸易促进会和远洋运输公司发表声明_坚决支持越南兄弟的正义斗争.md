	China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and China Ocean Shipping Company today issued a statement strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' new escalation of the war in Vietnam and their new "peace talks" deception. They resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

	The statement points out that the U.S. imperialists, in defiance of international law, have bombed many foreign ships engaged in trade with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, causing serious losses of life and property to the Vietnamese people and many other nations, and disrupting normal international commercial shipping. The statement says that the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and China Ocean Shipping Company, representing all members of China's trade and shipping industries, strongly protest and vehemently condemn this new heinous crime of the U.S. imperialists.

	The statement says that recently, with the active collusion of the Soviet revisionist leadership, the U.S. imperialists have been intensively promoting a "peace talks" charade; at the same time, U.S. military and political leaders such as Johnson have convened the Guam war conference, escalating the war, in an attempt to further intensify the aggression against Vietnam. In the face of the heroic Vietnamese people who dare to struggle and dare to win, the U.S. and Soviet revisionists' collusion to escalate the aggression against Vietnam will only hasten their own doom. The statement says that the Chinese people, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, will forever stand together with the fraternal Vietnamese people, fight together, and win together.

    我国际贸易促进会和远洋运输公司发表声明
    坚决支持越南兄弟的正义斗争
    据新华社二十三日讯  中国国际贸易促进委员会和中国远洋运输公司今天发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南进行新的战争“升级”和玩弄新的“和谈”阴谋，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。
    声明指出，美帝国主义无视国际公法，轰炸了同越南民主共和国进行贸易往来的许多外国船只，造成越南人民和其他许多国家人民生命和财产的严重损失，破坏了国际正常商业航运。声明说，中国国际贸易促进委员会和中国远洋运输公司代表中国贸易界和航运界全体人员，对美帝国主义这一新的滔天罪行，表示最强烈的抗议和最愤怒的谴责。
    声明说，最近，美帝国主义在苏联修正主义领导集团的积极配合下，大搞“和谈”骗局；同时约翰逊等美国军政头目还召开关岛战争会议，大搞战争“升级”，妄图加紧扩大侵越战争。在敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄的越南人民面前，美帝和苏修勾结在一起加紧扩大侵略越南的战争，只会加速自己的灭亡。声明说，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，将永远同兄弟的越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
