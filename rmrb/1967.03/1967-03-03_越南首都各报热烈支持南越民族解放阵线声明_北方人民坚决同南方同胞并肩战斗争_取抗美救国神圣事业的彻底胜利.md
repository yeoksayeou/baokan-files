Newspapers in the Vietnamese capital have strongly supported the declaration issued by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 28, expressing the determination of the people in North Vietnam to stand shoulder to shoulder with their southern brethren in the fight against American aggression and to achieve a complete victory in the sacred cause of resistance against the Americans and national salvation.

The New China News Agency reported from Hanoi on March 1 that various newspapers in Hanoi published editorials on March 1, strongly supporting the declaration issued by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 28. They expressed the determination of the people in North Vietnam to stand shoulder to shoulder with their 14 million southern brethren in the fight against American aggression and to achieve a complete victory in the sacred cause of resistance against the Americans and national salvation.

The editorial in the *People's Daily* pointed out that, just like the declaration issued on March 22, 1965, the declaration issued by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 28 is a powerful indictment of the aggressive crimes committed by the American bandits. It is a stirring call to arms for the military and people of South Vietnam, urging them to advance and annihilate the enemy, liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country.

The editorial said: In the two years between the issuance of these two declarations by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, American imperialism has launched an aggressive war against Vietnam and has gradually intensified and expanded this war, turning it into the largest-scale war of aggression in the world today. Facts have proven that American imperialism is the most dangerous destroyer of Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and is the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people.

The editorial pointed out that the Johnson clique has been constantly shouting about its "peace intentions," but this so-called "intention" has been exposed by its own "escalation" actions. It is precisely Johnson who regards his war "escalation" measures as the "best way to bring peace." And his "peace" is the "peace" under the muzzle of the aggressors.

The editorial emphasized that the people of South Vietnam must unite closely, grasp their weapons, and advance to annihilate the enemy.

The editorial warned: The United States must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other war actions, and withdraw all U.S. troops and their mercenary forces from South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam should, according to the program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the sole genuine representative of the people of South Vietnam, solve their internal affairs themselves. The determination of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is an ironclad determination. If the aggressors and their lackeys defy the sacred will of the Vietnamese people and continue to escalate the war, they will surely receive the punishment they deserve.

The editorial in the *Hanoi Capital Daily* said that the declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is a powerful indictment against the American aggressors and a stirring call to arms for the 14 million people of South Vietnam to advance bravely and demand blood debt from the aggressors.

The editorial said: The just declaration of the 14 million people of South Vietnam has received the enthusiastic response and complete support of the 17 million people of North Vietnam. The people of Hanoi resolutely respond to the call of their southern brethren, resolutely smash all new military adventures of American imperialism, and at the same time promote socialist construction, making contributions to the task of the great rear area in fully supporting their southern brethren.

The editorial in the *New Era Daily* said that no matter how many troops, planes, and warships the American bandits send, the Vietnamese people's determination to resist the Americans and save the nation remains unshakable, and the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people remains firm.

The editorial said: As long as there are American aggressor troops on Vietnamese soil, the people of the South will not lay down their weapons. The people of the North will resolutely make any sacrifice and face any difficulty to fight for the liberation of the South.

The editorial in the *Vanguard Daily* said: Vietnamese youth fully support the declaration of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The four million members and youth participating in the "Three Preparations" movement in the North are determined to fight side by side with the three million youth participating in the "Five Leads" movement in the South and the heroic military and people of the South in the sacred war of resistance against American aggression.

    越南首都各报热烈支持南越民族解放阵线声明
    北方人民坚决同南方同胞并肩战斗争  取抗美救国神圣事业的彻底胜利
    新华社河内一日电　河内各报一日纷纷发表社论，热烈支持越南南方民族解放阵线二月二十八日的声明，表示越南北方人民坚决同一千四百万南方骨肉同胞并肩战斗，打败美国侵略者，争取抗美救国的神圣事业的彻底胜利。
    《人民报》的社论指出，同一九六五年三月二十二日的声明一样，越南南方民族解放阵线二月二十八日的声明，是对美国强盗的侵略罪行的有力控诉，是向越南南方军民发出的雄壮的号召书，号召他们冲向前去消灭敌人，解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国。
    社论说：在越南南方民族解放阵线发表这两项声明之间的两年中，美帝国主义对越南发动了侵略战争，并逐步加强和扩大这场战争，使它变成当前世界上规模最大的侵略战争。事实证明，美帝国主义是越南的主权、独立和领土完整的最危险的破坏者，是越南民族的不共戴天的敌人。
    社论指出，约翰逊集团不断叫嚷“和平诚意”，但是这种所谓“诚意”，恰恰被它自己的战争“升级”行动所揭穿。正是约翰逊把自己的战争“升级”措施看成是“带来和平的最好途径”。而他的“和平”，是侵略者枪口下的“和平”。
    社论强调说，越南南方人民必须紧密团结、握紧武器，冲向前去消灭敌人。
    社论警告说：美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，必须把美国军队及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，让越南南方人民根据南方人民的唯一真正代表——越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领，自己解决自己的内部事务。越南南方民族解放阵线的这个决心，是钢铁般的决心。侵略者及其走狗违背越南民族的神圣愿望，继续进行战争“升级”，它们必将遭到应得的惩罚。
    《首都河内报》的社论说，越南南方民族解放阵线的声明是审判美国侵略者的有力的控诉书，是鞭策一千四百万南方同胞奋勇前进，向侵略者讨还血债的气壮山河的战斗号角。
    社论说，一千四百万越南南方人民的这一正义的声明，得到一千七百万越南北方人民的热烈响应和彻底支持。河内人民坚决响应骨肉南方的号召，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的一切新的军事冒险行动，同时促进社会主义建设，为完成全心全意支援南方同胞的大后方的战斗任务作出贡献。
    《新时代报》的社论说，不管美国强盗出动多少军队，派遣多少飞机军舰，越南人民抗美救国的决心仍然是不可动摇的，越南人民的斗志仍然是坚定的。
    社论说：当越南的国土上还有美国侵略军的时候，南方人民决不会放下武器。北方人民将坚决不惜任何牺牲，不怕任何困难，为解放南方而奋斗。
    《前锋报》的社论说：越南青年完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的声明。北方四百万参加“三准备”运动的团员和青年决心在抗击美国侵略者的神圣抗战中，同南方三百万参加“五带头”运动的青年和英雄的南方军民并肩作战。
