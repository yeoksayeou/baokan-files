In the midst of a bustling spring production campaign, the rural communes in Yunnan Province's Yuxian County have begun widespread rice and tobacco seedling cultivation.

Yuxian County is a famous tobacco-producing area and a major rice-producing region in Yunnan. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres here have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, significantly raising their ideological awareness. They have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," making this year's spring production better than last year's. After reading "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Letter to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Rural People's Communes Across the Country," the brigade leader of Yanhe Brigade in Yanhe Commune immediately implemented it among all the cadres and commune members in the brigade. He organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, summarized the experience of increasing production over the years, discussed this year's sowing and seedling-raising work, and personally led the commune members in plowing the seedling fields, applying fertilizer, and selecting seeds. The revolutionary youths and brigade leader of the third production brigade in Chengguan Commune's Zhenjing Brigade together studied Chairman Mao's essay "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" This helped the brigade leader overcome conservative thoughts of not daring to actively promote new varieties and scientific methods. This production brigade now, with the agreement of the commune members, uses high-yield varieties for all rice, and all seeds are treated with chemical agents. The sowing and seedling-raising work for rice and tobacco in other people's communes in Yuxian County this year started earlier than last year, the seedling fields are more meticulously prepared, more fertilizer is applied, and 90% of the rice uses high-yield varieties; they also break old habits and use scientific methods for soaking and selecting seeds.

    广大贫下中农和干部贯彻抓革命促生产方针
    玉溪县春耕生产热气腾腾
    新华社昆明十二日电  在热气腾腾的春耕生产高潮中，云南省玉溪县农村人民公社普遍开始种育稻秧和烟草秧苗。
    玉溪县是著名的烟草产地和云南的稻谷主要产区。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这里的广大贫下中农、革命干部活学活用毛主席著作，思想觉悟大大提高。他们坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把今年的春耕生产搞得比去年好。研和公社研和大队队长读了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》后，立即在全队的干部、社员中贯彻执行。他组织大家学习毛主席著作，总结了历年增产的经验，讨论了今年的撒种、育苗工作，并亲自带领社员们翻整秧田、施肥、选种。城关公社澙井大队第三生产队革命派青年和生产队长一起学习了毛主席的《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》这篇著作，帮助队长克服了不敢积极推广新品种和科学方法的保守思想。这个生产队现在经社员商量同意，稻谷全部采用良种，种子都用化学药剂处理。玉溪县其他人民公社今年稻谷、烟叶的撒种、育苗工作都动手得比去年早，秧田比去年整理得细致，肥料比去年施得多；稻谷百分之九十采用了高产的品种；还打破陈规陋习，采用科学方法浸种、选种。
