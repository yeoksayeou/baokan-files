One day, a Tanzanian driver gave a portrait of Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform and full of vigor, to a Chinese expert. Below the portrait, in neat Swahili script, it was written: "Chairman Mao is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts." He said that he had not known how to paint before, but out of his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, he began to learn. He said that he had already painted several portraits of Chairman Mao and given them to his friends to hang in their homes, so they could see the great leader Chairman Mao every day.

A young lathe operator from Zanzibar pasted a color portrait of Chairman Mao he had cut out near his machine. He told his friends: "I want to see Chairman Mao's portrait every day. Whenever I see Chairman Mao, I feel full of energy, and I feel that my work is very meaningful."

    让人们天天看到毛主席
    一天，一位坦桑尼亚司机把一幅画着穿着草绿色军装、神采奕奕的毛主席画像送给中国专家。画像下面用斯瓦希利文端端正正地写着：“毛主席是我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手。毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。”他说，他以前并不懂得绘画，但出于对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，才开始学画。他说，他已经画了一些毛主席像送给他的朋友贴在他们家里，让他们可以天天见着伟大领袖毛主席。
    一位桑给巴尔青年镟工把他剪下来的毛主席彩色画像贴在他的机器附近的墙上。他对他的朋友们说：“我要天天看毛主席像。我一看见毛主席，就感到自己浑身是劲，感到我的工作很有意义。”
