The broad masses of women in Albania are actively participating in the revolutionization movement, continuously raising their socialist consciousness, and achieving outstanding results in labor, work, and study.

Women in cities such as Tirana and Vlorë have put forward many valuable suggestions during the revolutionization movement, actively supporting agriculture, and working together with the people of the whole country to produce grain on a large scale. Thirty-two women from the handicraft cooperative in Elbasan enthusiastically responded to the call of the Albanian Party of Labor, proposing to work for two to three years in the newly established mountain agricultural cooperative. This initiative was warmly supported by women in areas such as Korçë and Shkodër. In Shkodër alone, 1,500 women responded to this initiative.

Before liberation, the broad masses of women in Albania were at the lowest level of society, suffering from oppression and exploitation. After liberation, the social status of women underwent a tremendous change. Under the correct leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor, they actively participated in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. A large number of women actively participate in the country's political life and hold important positions in party and government organs. Among the total number of representatives in the People's Assembly, women representatives account for more than sixteen percent.

The broad masses of women have achieved outstanding results in labor, work, and study. Female members of the agricultural cooperative in Gjirokastër worked an average of 300 labor days each last year, far exceeding the quota. The "Eight Sisters Production Team" in the "Hammer and Sickle" knitting factory in Korçë implemented a collective labor quota system, carried out activities to improve quality and comparative learning and mutual aid, and achieved outstanding results in production, becoming a model for the whole country to learn from.

    开展比学赶帮活动　热烈支援农业生产
    阿妇女在革命化运动中作出优异成绩
    据新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大妇女积极参加革命化运动，不断提高社会主义觉悟，在劳动、工作和学习等方面都作出了优异的成绩。
    地拉那和发罗拉等城市的妇女在革命化运动中提出了许多宝贵的建议，积极支援农业，和全国人民一起大搞粮食生产。爱尔巴桑区手工业合作社的三十二名妇女热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的号召，提出到新成立的山区农业社劳动二——三年，这个倡议得到科尔察、斯库台等区妇女的积极响应，仅斯库台区响应这一倡议的妇女就达一千五百名。
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚广大妇女处于社会的最低层，备受压迫和剥削。解放后，妇女的社会地位发生了巨大的变化，她们在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。大批妇女积极参加国家的政治生活，在党政机关中担负着重要职务。在人民议会代表总数中，妇女代表占百分之十六以上。
    广大妇女在劳动、工作和学习等方面都作出了优异的成绩。吉诺卡斯特区的农业社女社员去年每人平均做了三百个劳动日，大大超过定额。科尔察区“锤子和镰刀”针织厂的“八姊妹生产队”，实行集体劳动定额制，开展提高质量和比学赶帮的活动，在生产等方面取得了优异成绩，成为全国学习的一面旗帜。
