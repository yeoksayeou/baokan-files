The poor and lower-middle peasants of Taoyuan Commune in Shanxi Province's Wenxi County are responding to the latest call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee by vigorously promoting revolution and production. They are making spring plowing a roaring success.

The revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members are braving the spring chill and heading to the fields early in the morning. At present, all 4,600-plus mu of watered wheat fields in the entire commune have been irrigated, promoting early greening of the wheat; 6,800 mu of dryland wheat fields have been rolled and fertilized to conserve moisture. Most of the cotton and autumn fields have been leveled, and the prepared base fertilizer is being transported to the fields. Most of the cotton seeds needed for spring sowing have been selected and dried. The revolutionary faction, noting the lack of rain and snow and the onset of drought, has assigned part of the labor force to form a water conservancy construction team to drill wells and repair canals, striving to expand the area of watered fields.

The revolutionary faction of poor and lower-middle peasants in Taoyuan Commune has exposed and criticized the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Wenxi County Committee and Taoyuan Commune Party Committee. They have achieved great unity and formed the Taoyuan Commune Revolutionary Peasants' Rebel Corps, seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the commune party committee and establishing a revolutionary production temporary committee.

The revolutionary faction of poor and lower-middle peasants is actively implementing Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," releasing the boundless socialist enthusiasm hidden within the broad revolutionary masses like a volcano. The revolutionary faction of the third production brigade in Taoyuan Village formed a shock team that, in just two days, completed a project to divert water across a 30-meter-wide river channel, turning more than 60 mu of dryland into watered fields.

The production leadership team composed of the revolutionary faction of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Taoyuan Commune has implemented the mass line work method, making spring plowing both spectacular and solid.

In the spring plowing production campaign, the revolutionary faction of poor and lower-middle peasants in Taoyuan Commune, following Chairman Mao's consistent instructions to "be good at identifying cadres," "be good at using cadres," and "be good at protecting cadres," has conducted specific analyses of the cadres at the commune, brigade, and production team levels, treating them differently. For those who have made mistakes but are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements and who insist on not changing or are incorrigible, they are encouraged to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, proactively check themselves, and take the lead in spring plowing, standing tall and daring to lead production. Currently, many grassroots leading cadres in Taoyuan Commune are actively and proactively fighting alongside the broad revolutionary masses on the front lines of spring plowing production.

    桃园公社贫下中农坚决照毛主席的指示办事
    团结社队干部把春耕搞得热火朝天
    据新华社太原七日电  山西闻喜县桃园公社贫下中农响应毛主席、党中央提出的最新号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把备耕工作和春耕生产搞得热火朝天。
    贫下中农革命派和广大社员，冒着春寒，一早就奔向田间。现在，全公社四千六百多亩水地小麦普遍进行了浇灌，促进了小麦早返青；六千八百亩旱地小麦，都进行了耙耱滚压保墒，追了肥。棉田、秋田大部分作了平整，已经准备好的底肥正陆续向田间运送。春播所需的棉籽，绝大部分经过挑选和翻晒。革命派根据雨雪缺少，旱象露头的情况，抽出一部分劳力，组成一支水利建设队伍，打井、修渠，千方百计扩大水地面积。
    桃园公社的贫下中农革命派揭发批判了旧闻喜县委和桃园公社党委内的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，实行了大联合，组成了桃园公社革命农民造反兵团，夺了公社党委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，成立了革命生产临时委员会。
    贫下中农革命派积极贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，使蕴藏在广大革命群众中的不可估量的社会主义积极性，象火山一样爆发出来。桃村大队第三生产队的革命派，组成了突击队，两天之内，完成了一项把水引过三十米宽的河槽的工程，使六十多亩旱地变成了水地。
    桃园公社由贫下中农革命派和革命干部组成的生产领导班子，贯彻执行了群众路线工作方法，使春耕生产既搞得轰轰烈烈，又搞得扎扎实实。
    桃园公社的贫下中农革命派在春耕生产热潮中，根据毛主席一贯指示的要“善于识别干部”、“善于使用干部”、“善于爱护干部”的教导，对公社、大队和生产队的干部进行了具体分析，区别对待。对那些犯有错误，但不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，鼓励他们虚心听取群众意见，主动检查，走上春耕第一线，挺起腰杆大胆领导生产。目前，桃园公社不少基层领导干部，都主动积极地和广大革命群众奋战在春耕生产的第一线上。
