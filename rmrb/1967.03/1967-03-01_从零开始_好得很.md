“Starting from Zero Is Great”

“Where is the Lu Xun Corps Going?” and “Cheering for the Big Character Poster of the ‘East Is Red’ Little Generals” are two excellent articles that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The experiences of the “East Is Red” Combat Team’s little generals are worth learning from in many ways, and one of the most valuable points is their humble spirit in the face of victory.

In our revolutionary ranks, some comrades are not as self-aware as the little generals of the “East Is Red” Combat Team. They become arrogant in the face of initial victories, thinking they have contributed to the revolution and self-proclaiming themselves as steadfast revolutionary leftists. They do not engage in self-revolution and cannot accept criticism from others. They engage in seeking fame, forming cliques, and small-groupism, among other things. All of this affects the great alliance of revolutionaries. The main reason these comrades act this way is that they have lost the humble spirit of a revolutionary, allowing the “self” to take over.

Look at the little generals of the “East Is Red” Combat Team! In the face of glorious achievements and abundant victories, they are not satisfied. They firmly proclaim the slogan, “Achievements only indicate the past; everything starts from zero.”

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason for us to be arrogant and self-satisfied. Being humble makes one progress, while arrogance makes one fall behind. We must always remember this truth.” The little generals of “East Is Red” have truly remembered this truth and put it into practice. They are indeed Chairman Mao’s little red soldiers.

We are determined to learn from the little generals of the “East Is Red” Combat Team, learning from them how to actively study and apply Chairman Mao’s works in battle. We should see ourselves both as a force for revolution and as an object of revolution, thoroughly eliminating selfish thoughts from our minds. We will be revolutionary fighters who are never self-satisfied.

    “从零开始”好得很
    《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》和《为“东方红”小将的一张大字报叫好》，是两篇闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的好文章。东方红战斗队小将们的经验，值得我们学习的地方很多，其中很可贵的一条，是他们在胜利面前始终不骄傲的谦虚精神。
    在我们革命派队伍里，有些同志不象“东方红”小将们那样自觉。他们在初步胜利面前就骄傲起来，自以为对革命有功，自封为坚定的革命左派，不进行自我革命，也听不得别人的批评。他们闹风头主义、山头主义、小团体主义，等等。这都影响了革命派的大联合。这些同志所以如此，重要的原因就是丢掉了革命者的谦虚精神，让“私”字占了上风。
    看看东方红战斗队的小将们吧！他们在辉煌的成绩、丰硕的战果面前，毫不满足，他们坚定地喊出了“成绩只能说明过去，一切从零开始”的口号。
    毛主席教导我们：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”“东方红”小将们真正记住了这个真理，并且实践了这个真理。他们不愧是毛主席的红小兵。
    我们决心向“东方红”小将们学习，学习他们在战斗中活学活用毛主席著作，既把自己当作革命的力量，又把自己当作革命的对象，狠革自己头脑里私心杂念的命，做一个永不自满的革命派战士。
