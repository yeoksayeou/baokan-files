According to Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, March 27th, two Somali workers wrote a letter to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent on the 27th, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's bloody suppression of Chinese students and their assault on Chinese diplomatic personnel.

The letter states: "The Soviet leadership's new provocations against the 700 million Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong are aimed at preventing the awakening of the Soviet people, who will one day rise up to seize power from a handful of revisionists." The letter also says: "The Soviet revisionist leadership is doing everything it can to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought." "But the facts contradict their wishes. Mao Zedong Thought has spread throughout the world, becoming the strongest weapon for revolutionary people to fight and overcome all obstacles and difficulties."

The two Somali workers included a quotation from Chairman Mao in their letter: "The people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the world must dare to struggle, must not fear sacrifices and must advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All the monsters of the world will be routed." They went on to point out: The modern Soviet revisionists will ultimately put the noose prepared by all the revolutionary people of the world around their own necks, burying themselves in the graves they have dug.

    索马里工人谴责苏修领导集团法西斯暴行
    苏修终将埋葬在自掘的坟墓里
    据新华社摩加迪沙二十七日电　索马里两位工人二十七日写信给新华社记者，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团血腥镇压中国留学生和殴打中国外交人员的法西斯暴行。
    这封信说：“苏联领导集团对在毛泽东主席领导下的七亿中国人民采取的这些新的挑衅行动，目的是要阻止苏联人民的觉醒，而苏联人民总有一天会起来夺一小撮修正主义者的权的。”信中还说：“苏联修正主义领导集团千方百计地企图阻挠毛泽东思想的传播。”“但事实与他们的主观愿望相反，毛泽东思想传遍了全世界，它成了革命人民进行斗争、克服各种阻力和困难的最强大的武器。”
    这两位索马里工人在信中写上了毛主席的一段语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”他们接着指出：苏联现代修正主义者终将把全世界一切革命人民准备好的绞索套在自己的脖子上，埋葬在他们自己挖掘的坟墓里。
