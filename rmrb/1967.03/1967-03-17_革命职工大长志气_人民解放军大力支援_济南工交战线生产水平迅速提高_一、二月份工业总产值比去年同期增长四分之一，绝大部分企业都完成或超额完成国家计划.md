Inspired by the victory of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in seizing power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong Province and Jinan City, the broad masses of revolutionary workers on Jinan's industrial and transportation frontlines have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "save money to make revolution." They have bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. With the strong support of the PLA units stationed in Jinan, they have achieved victories in both revolution and production. In January and February, the city's total industrial output increased by 25.9% compared to the same period last year. The vast majority of enterprises and products have completed or overfulfilled the state plan, with product quality remaining stable and improving.

In late January, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Jinan City carried out a great alliance and revolutionary "three-in-one combination," seizing the party, government, financial, and cultural powers that had been held by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee. This great victory greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, greatly inspiring the revolutionary spirit and production enthusiasm of the revolutionary workers. The Jinan Needle Factory, which had been disrupted by class enemies in the previous period and only completed 56% of its production plan in January, saw a rapid improvement in production levels after the revolutionary masses of the proletariat won the power struggle in February. The daily output of nails increased from 6.8 tons to 9.8 tons, and a new record of 14 tons per day was created since the factory's establishment. After seizing power, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat at the Jinan Wind-driven Machinery Factory quickly established a new revolutionary order and overfulfilled the February production plan by 22.7%.

Under the great call of Chairman Mao, to strongly support agricultural production and launch the first shot of spring production, many factory workers have taken up a combat posture and quickly launched a production surge. Products such as phosphate fertilizer and water pumps have been completed in quality and quantity according to the plan. The revolutionary workers and cadres of the Jinan Second Transportation Company have specially arranged forces to transport materials needed for agriculture, simplified the consignment procedures, expanded rural service points, and visited communes and production brigades to ensure the timely completion of the transportation tasks for fertilizers, pesticides, cement, and coal.

In the struggle for the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" to seize power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the broad masses of revolutionary workers have insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Opposing Liberalism," and "Carrying the Revolution Through to the End." They have carried out rectification while fighting, broken down selfishness, and established selflessness. After seizing power through a great alliance, the revolutionary workers of the Seventh Woodworking Cooperative in the city seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, conducted criticism and self-criticism against various non-proletarian thoughts within the revolutionary organization, promoted ideological revolutionization, and thus ensured victories in both revolution and production.

    革命职工大长志气  人民解放军大力支援
    济南工交战线生产水平迅速提高
    一、二月份工业总产值比去年同期增长四分之一，绝大部分企业都完成或超额完成国家计划
    据新华社济南电　在山东省和济南市无产阶级革命派实行革命的“三结合”联合夺权胜利的鼓舞下，济南市工业交通战线广大革命职工，坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，在中国人民解放军驻济南部队的大力支持下，取得革命和生产的双胜利。一月和二月份，全市工业总产值比去年同期增长了百分之二十五点九，绝大多数企业和产品都完成或超额完成了国家计划，产品质量稳定提高。
    一月下旬，济南市无产阶级革命派实行大联合和革命的“三结合”，夺取了市委、市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所把持的党、政、财、文大权。这个伟大的胜利，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，极大地鼓舞了革命职工的斗志和生产积极性。济南针钉厂，在前一段时间由于阶级敌人的捣乱，一月份生产计划仅完成百分之五十六。二月份，无产阶级革命派取得了夺权斗争胜利之后，便狠抓革命，猛促生产，生产水平迅速提高，元钉日产量由过去的六点八吨提高到九点八吨，并且创造了日产十四吨的建厂以来的新纪录。济南风动机械厂无产阶级革命派夺权后，迅速建立了革命的新秩序，超额百分之二十二点七完成了二月份的生产计划。
    在毛主席的伟大号召下，为了大力支援农业生产，打响春耕生产第一炮，许多工厂企业的革命职工都以战斗的姿态，迅速掀起了增产热潮，磷肥、水泵等产品都按质、按量完成了计划。济南市第二运输公司的革命职工和革命干部，为运输农业需要的物资专门安排了力量，并且简化托运手续，扩大农村服务点，深入社、队走访，保证及时地完成了化肥、农药、水泥、煤炭等物资的运输任务。
    在无产阶级革命派实行革命的“三结合”联合夺权的斗争中，广大革命职工坚持活学活用毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》、《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作，边战斗，边整风，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。市第七木器社的革命职工大联合夺权之后，认真学习毛主席著作，针对革命组织内部存在的各种非无产阶级思想，开展了批评和自我批评，促进了思想革命化，从而保证了革命、生产双胜利。
