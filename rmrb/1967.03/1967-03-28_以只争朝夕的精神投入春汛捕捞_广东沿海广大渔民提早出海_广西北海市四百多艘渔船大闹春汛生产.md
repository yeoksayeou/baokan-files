The spring fishing season in the South China Sea is in full swing. Fishermen along the coast of Guangdong are sailing out to sea with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," engaging in intense spring fishing activities.

Since last winter, while actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fishermen have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have diligently prepared for the spring fishing season. Many fishery communes have equipped themselves with new motorized boats. The fishery supply and marketing departments have also timely supplied various fishing production materials such as rubber threads, wood, and hemp to the fishing ports.

To ensure a bumper harvest during the spring fishing season, coastal fishermen organized fishing fleets to cross the harbor shortly after the Spring Festival, heading to fishing grounds with good fishing conditions to wait for the nets to be lowered. Revolutionary cadres from various fishing ports have also stepped forward, carrying Chairman Mao's works with them to the front lines of production. Some fishing grounds have established revolutionary "three-in-one" command organizations on the front lines.

The Zhujiang Estuary fishing ground, which enters the spring fishing season earlier, has seen an increase in net catches compared to last year, and the number of fishing boats lowering their nets has also increased. Fishing boats fly red flags, and the fishing grounds are bustling with a harvest scene.

During the peak fishing season, revolutionary workers in the fishery supply and marketing departments have been busy purchasing and transporting fish. In the first and second decades of March alone, more than 3.3 million pounds of fish were transported to Guangzhou for supply.

The fishermen and revolutionary cadres of various fishery communes in Beihai City, Guangxi, are making a big fuss about spring fishing production, with more than 400 fishing boats sailing out to sea.

The spring fishing season is one of the two peak fishing seasons in the Beibu Gulf fishing ground each year. After studying the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Various Levels of Cadres in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" in earnest, the broad masses of fishermen, fishery commune members, and revolutionary cadres are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Some revolutionary cadres from production brigades in various communes have rushed to the front lines to participate in and lead production aboard fishing boats. Members of the shallow-sea operation team in Dijiao Commune have caught more than 8,000 pounds of fresh large shrimp in three days, firing the first shot for Beihai City's spring fishing production.

    新华社广州二十六日电　南海春汛进入旺产季节。广东沿海广大渔民，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，提早扬帆出海，投入紧张的春汛捕捞。
    从去年冬季开始，广大渔民在积极投身无产阶级文化大革命的同时，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，认真做好春汛准备工作，许多渔业公社还新装了机帆船。水产供销部门也及时向各渔港供应了大量胶丝、木材、黄麻等渔业生产资料。
    为了争取春汛生产丰收，沿海渔民在春节过后就提前组织船队过港，到春汛渔情好的渔场等待下网。各渔港大批革命干部，也挺身而出，带着毛主席著作随船出海，到生产第一线去。有的渔场已成立了革命的“三结合”的第一线生产指挥机构。
    春汛较早的珠江口渔场，网产量比去年高，渔船下网也普遍比去年多。捕鱼船队红旗招展，渔场上一片丰收景象。
    在旺汛期间，水产供销部门革命职工加紧收购调运。仅三月上、中旬调往广州市供应的鱼货就有三百三十多万斤。
    新华社南宁二十六日电　广西北海市各渔业公社广大社员和革命干部，大闹春汛生产，四百多艘渔船已扬帆出海。
    春汛，是北部湾渔场一年中两个捕鱼旺季之一。广大渔工、渔业公社社员和革命干部在认真学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》以后，激动地表示：一定要按毛主席的教导去做，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”有些公社的大队革命干部，纷纷随渔船出海，到第一线参加生产，领导生产。地角公社浅海作业组的社员们，三天内捕获鲜大虾八千多斤，为北海市的春汛生产打响了第一炮。
