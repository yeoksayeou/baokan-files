The West Ninh battlefield in South Vietnam has sent a heartening report of victory: the heroic Liberation Armed Forces have annihilated approximately 3,300 American invaders, South Korean, and Australian mercenaries in the past 17 days. This glorious victory comes on the heels of the Liberation Armed Forces' successful repulsion of a major American-led "sweeping" operation in West Ninh in the first half of February, signaling the imminent collapse of the U.S. aggressors' so-called "second dry-season counteroffensive plan."

Since early February, within just over a month, the American aggressors have launched two major "sweeping" operations against the liberated areas of West Ninh. In the first "sweeping" operation, the U.S. forces deployed over 8,000 troops, resulting in the annihilation of more than 1,000 of their own, ending in a humiliating defeat. Subsequently, starting from February 22nd, the American aggressors launched what they claimed to be the largest "sweeping" operation in the Vietnam War, involving approximately 45,000 U.S. and mercenary troops. However, upon setting foot on this heroic land, the aggressors were met with a fierce counterattack from the military and civilians of West Ninh. In just the first seven days (from February 22nd to 28th), the Liberation Armed Forces had already killed and wounded 1,048 American soldiers, destroyed 64 tanks and amphibious armored vehicles, shot down 36 aircraft, and demolished 12 artillery pieces. By March 10th, after 17 days of battle, the Liberation Armed Forces had collectively annihilated and severely damaged one motorized infantry battalion, eight infantry and artillery companies of the American invaders, destroyed 344 various military vehicles, shot down 49 aircraft, and demolished 55 artillery pieces. This is a great victory for the Liberation Armed Forces since the start of the dry season, another triumphant song in the people's war of Vietnam.

The brave military and civilians of West Ninh demonstrated the immense power of people's war in this anti-"sweeping" battle, fighting exceptionally well. They employed the strategies and tactics of people's war, leveraging their strengths to exploit the enemy's weaknesses, rendering the enemy's numerous aircraft, tanks, and artillery ineffective. The enemy could not strike the Liberation Armed Forces, while the Liberation Armed Forces not only struck the enemy but did so with precision and ferocity. Tens of thousands of American aggressors were constantly in a passive and defensive position.

On March 10th, the Liberation Armed Forces launched a surprise attack on two companies of American troops near Bau Grotto and a brigade of American troops stationed in the Tam Ban area, routing the enemy. That day, the artillery of the Liberation Armed Forces rained down on the enemy's camp. As the cannon fire subsided, the Liberation Armed Forces bravely charged into the enemy's positions, inflicting heavy casualties. In the Tam Ban area alone, the Liberation Armed Forces killed and wounded over 500 American soldiers, destroyed 170 enemy tanks, armored vehicles, and other military vehicles, and demolished 11 artillery pieces of various calibers. The guerrilla forces, in close coordination with the Liberation Army, also fought the enemy to a standstill. The American aggressors, fearing the guerrilla forces' landmines, often moved in single file, carefully watching the ground. At this moment, the guerrilla forces would emerge from nowhere to attack them.

The liberated area of West Ninh is only about 90 kilometers from Saigon. For a long time, it has been like a sharp sword hanging over the enemy's head, making the American puppet regime in Saigon anxious day and night. To "swallow" this small liberated area, the American aggressors have spared no effort in launching multiple "sweeping" operations. However, each of the enemy's "sweeping" operations has ended in failure, and the larger the scale of the "sweeping," the more disastrous the failure. The recent glorious victory of the West Ninh military and civilians in annihilating over 3,000 American and mercenary troops has once again proven that American imperialism is merely a paper tiger, strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

Chairman Mao said, "What is the real iron wall? It is the people, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries." The military and civilians of West Ninh, united under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and all the people of South Vietnam, are the iron wall that American imperialism can never overcome.

### 南越人民战争的又一曲凯歌  西宁军民十七天歼侵略军三千多  粉碎美帝在侵越战争中规模最大的一次“扫荡”

    南越人民战争的又一曲凯歌
    西宁军民十七天歼侵略军三千多
    粉碎美帝在侵越战争中规模最大的一次“扫荡”
    据新华社十八日讯  本社记者报道：越南南方西宁省战场传来了振奋人心的捷报：英雄的解放武装力量在最近十七天中，共歼灭美国侵略军、南朝鲜和澳大利亚帮凶军约三千三百名。这个辉煌胜利，是西宁省解放武装力量刚刚在二月上半月粉碎了美国强盗发动的一次大规模“扫荡”之后取得的，它预示着美国侵略者的所谓“第二个旱季反攻计划”正在走向全面破产。
    从二月初以来，在短短的一个多月中，美国侵略者就向西宁省解放区发动了两次大规模“扫荡”。第一次“扫荡”，美军出动八千多人，结果被歼灭一千多人，“扫荡”遭到了可耻的失败。接着，从二月二十二日开始，美国强盗又发动了号称“越南战争中最大”的“扫荡”，参加“扫荡”的有美国侵略军和帮凶军共约四万五千人。但是，侵略者一踏上这块英雄的土地，就遭到了西宁省军民的迎头痛击。单在头七天（二月二十二日到二十八日）中，解放武装力量就打死打伤美军一千零四十八名，击毁坦克和两栖装甲车六十四辆，击落飞机三十六架，摧毁大炮十二门。截至三月十日，仅仅经过十七天战斗，解放武装力量总共歼灭和重创美国侵略军一个摩托化营、八个步兵连和炮兵连，击毁各种军车三百四十四辆，击落飞机四十九架，击毁大炮五十五门。这是解放武装力量旱季开始以来的一次伟大胜利，是越南人民战争中又一曲凯歌。
    英勇的西宁省军民在这次反“扫荡”战斗中，发挥人民战争的强大威力，打得非常出色。他们运用人民战争的战略战术，以己之长，攻敌之短，使敌人的大批飞机、坦克、大炮发挥不了作用。敌人要打解放武装力量打不着，而解放武装力量要打敌人，不仅打得着而且打得狠。几万名美国强盗无时不处于被动挨打的困境。
    三月十日，解放武装力量对保果附近的两连美军和驻扎在同班地区的一旅美军发起突然袭击，把敌人打得落花流水。这一天，解放武装力量的炮弹雨点般落在敌人的营地上。炮声刚过，解放武装力量勇猛插进敌人阵地，杀得敌人死伤累累。单在同班地区，解放武装力量就打死打伤五百多名美军，击毁敌人的坦克、装甲车和其他军车一百七十多辆，摧毁各种口径大炮十一门。游击队同解放军密切配合，也打得敌人寸步难行。美国强盗为了怕踏上游击队埋设的地雷，常常是“一个人跟一个人的脚印行进，一边走一边仔细看着地面”。而这时，游击队就神出鬼没地对他们进行袭击。
    西宁省解放区离西贡只有九十多公里。长期以来，它象一把利剑一样悬在敌人的头上，使呆在西贡的美伪统治集团日夜惶惶不安。为了“吞掉”这块面积不大的解放区，美国侵略者费尽九牛二虎之力对这里进行多次“扫荡”。但是，敌人的每一次“扫荡”都以失败而告终，而且“扫荡”的规模愈大，失败得就愈惨。英雄的西宁省军民最近取得歼灭美军和帮凶军三千多名的辉煌胜利，再一次雄辩地证明美帝国主义只不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。
    毛主席说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”团结在越南南方民族解放阵线旗帜下的西宁省军民和全体南越军民，就是美帝国主义永远无法战胜的铜墙铁壁。（附图片）
