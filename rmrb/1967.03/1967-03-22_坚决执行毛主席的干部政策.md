Editor's Note from *Red Flag* Magazine: The experience of the Red Guards in Yilan County, Heilongjiang Province, in implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres has universal significance and is worth learning from by revolutionary cadres across the country.

The experience of the Red Guards in Yilan County, Heilongjiang Province, tells us that implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres is a process of struggling against the bourgeois reactionary line and a process of struggling against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Those who advocate the bourgeois reactionary line want to shield a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. On the one hand, they label revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries." On the other hand, they adopt the approach of "overthrowing everything" towards cadres who dare to revolt and expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. To correctly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, we must thoroughly expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, thereby liberating a large number of cadres who have been persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line.

We must resolutely support revolutionary leading cadres to take the lead in making revolution. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, on the other hand, maliciously incite uninformed masses to struggle against the revolutionary leading cadres who first stand up. We must resolutely smash their conspiracy, which is of great significance in mobilizing a large number of cadres to make revolution.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party also instruct their accomplices to disguise themselves as "revolutionaries," infiltrate the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" power organs, and thus achieve the goal of sabotaging the revolution. We must be vigilant against their conspiracy.

In the struggle for power, the Red Guards in Yilan County resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and gradually achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." On March 7, we seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Yilan County Party Committee and announced the establishment of the Yilan County Revolutionary Committee.

To win over and unite the majority of cadres and to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we studied Chairman Mao's works in the struggle and engaged in a head-to-head struggle with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

I

At the beginning of the movement, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Yilan County Party Committee pushed a bourgeois reactionary line, instructing some people to establish "Fire Sea" Combat Team and "Revolutionary Rebel United Headquarters" and other puppet organizations in the county party committee and county people's committee organs to counter the revolutionary organization, the Red Guards Headquarters. To suppress the revolution, they wielded the "four sticks": those who are "naughty and mischievous" are not allowed to make a revolution; those with bad family backgrounds are not allowed to make a revolution; those who have made mistakes in the past are not allowed to make a revolution; and those in power are not allowed to make a revolution.

Mao Zedong Thought is invincible, and the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of cadres cannot be beaten down by "sticks." Deputy County Magistrate Liu Bingheng first stood up. He publicly supported the Red Guards and exposed the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee. Under the influence of Liu Bingheng's revolutionary actions, many revolutionary cadres were preparing to stand up and make a revolution. At this time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee panicked. They instructed the so-called "conservative" organizations to struggle against Liu Bingheng, attempting to force him to surrender and plug this loophole. At the same time, they, after careful planning, issued many orders to the deputy section-level and above cadres in the county organs, forbidding them to make a revolution. They indiscriminately excluded all 190-plus deputy section-level and above middle-level cadres in the county, making them all stand aside. They attempted to use this method to isolate the revolutionary faction and sabotage the Cultural Revolution.

We used Mao Zedong Thought to see through the enemy's conspiracy. We believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the majority of cadres are good or relatively good. The practice of regarding all those in power as bad and all to be overthrown is a product of the bourgeois reactionary line.

They made all deputy section-level and above cadres stand aside, so we countered by propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to these cadres. On February 14, we convened a meeting of all deputy section-level and above middle-level cadres in the county. At the meeting, we organized them to study relevant documents, announced that the orders forbidding them to make a revolution were invalid, and required revolutionary cadres to boldly stand up and appear before the masses. At the same time, we called on cadres who had made mistakes to put down their burdens, expose the enemy's crimes, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After a series of efforts, these cadres were basically mobilized.

To win over and unite the majority of cadres and to the greatest extent isolate the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we, on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, engaged in a face-to-face struggle with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee. Through the struggle, the broad masses of deceived cadres awakened and exposed and denounced the crimes of the capitalist-roaders. The class consciousness of the broad revolutionary cadres was further heightened. They, with practical actions loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smashed the enemy's conspiracy to sabotage the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

II

Under the suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, many revolutionary leading cadres still did not dare to stand up when it was time to establish a model of daring to struggle and daring to make a revolution. This was important in smashing the conspiracy of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and encouraging the broad masses of leading cadres to stand up and make a revolution.

On January 25 of this year, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee, together with some conservatives and rightists, staged a fake seizure of power. At this time, the question before us was whether we could find a person who truly supports the revolutionary faction from among the existing leading cadres to take the lead and fight with us to smash the class enemy's fake seizure of power. We analyzed several leading cadres and chose Comrade Liu Bingheng. He had been excluded and attacked by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee in the past; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he dared to approach and support the revolutionary faction. Thus, after several discussions with him, we proved that Comrade Liu Bingheng was a good cadre. He also expressed his resolute support for our revolutionary actions. He said, "I will not let down Chairman Mao's teachings and the help of my comrades!"

On January 29, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee, seeing that the power of the revolutionary faction was growing stronger and their days of collapse were approaching, incited uninformed peasant masses to enter the city, attempting to drive away comrades who came from Harbin to support our revolution and destroy our Red Guards Headquarters. At this critical moment of class struggle, Comrade Liu Bingheng stepped forward and, at a mass meeting, resolutely supported the Red Guards and exposed the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee against the Party and socialism. Comrade Liu Bingheng's revolutionary action disrupted the enemy's deployment and encouraged cadres who were about to stand up and make a revolution. The class enemy hated Comrade Liu Bingheng to the core, and on the very day he stood up, they instructed people to struggle against him, attempting to force him to abandon his support for the revolutionary faction. However, Comrade Liu Bingheng did not yield. He said, "The Red Guards Headquarters is the revolutionary faction, and I resolutely support them!" The class enemy still wanted Comrade Liu Bingheng to write a "self-criticism," but he firmly stated, "I have not made any mistakes. I believe my actions are revolutionary actions!" The class enemy, enraged, restricted his lawful personal freedom. Comrade Liu Bingheng still did not yield. He wrote the following oath in his copy of the *Quotations from Chairman Mao*: "On January 29, 1967, to defend Chairman Mao, I vow to defend Mao Zedong Thought with my life, to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire, my heart unshaken, my face unchanging, to act proactively and directly, let the class enemy's hard and soft tactics go to hell!"

The third issue of *Red Flag* published an editorial. Comrade Liu Bingheng heard the voice of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and his body was filled with boundless strength. At this time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee incited a batch of uninformed peasants to hold a meeting to struggle against him. Comrade Liu Bingheng used this opportunity to expose the enemy's conspiracy to the deceived peasant brothers. The enemy said he was "poisoning," and forced him to stop speaking three times. The peasants at the meeting saw this situation, understood the truth, and stood up to ask, "Why don't you let him speak? You have ghosts!" As a result, the class enemy lifted the stone to smash their own feet, and their conspiracy failed.

The revolutionary faction actively supported and encouraged Comrade Liu Bingheng's revolutionary struggle. When the enemy was about to further persecute Comrade Liu Bingheng, we rescued him and ensured his safety. We forged a fighting friendship with him in the life-and-death struggle.

Comrade Liu Bingheng's revolutionary action played a leading role among the broad masses of cadres in Yilan County. After Comrade Liu Bingheng stood up, he used his personal experience and insights to talk with many cadres who had made mistakes but were willing to make a revolution, encouraging them to stand up and make a revolution. Many leading cadres also visited Comrade Liu Bingheng's home to connect. This caused one revolutionary cadre after another to stand up and make a revolution.

III

We firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing the past and curing the future, treating the illness and saving the person" towards cadres who have made serious mistakes.

What kind of cadre is Comrade Na Xingya, a member of the county party committee and county magistrate? Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not only look at a cadre's one-time or one-event performance, but also at the cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." We followed Chairman Mao's teachings and made a comprehensive and historical analysis of Comrade Na Xingya's problems. Comrade Na Xingya, although he also implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was not good at emphasizing politics in his daily work, lacked fighting spirit, and made serious mistakes in his work style in Boli County. However, looking at his entire history, he is basically good. Since 1962, he has been in Yilan County for three years, during which he spent three years in San Dao Gang Commune Yongxing Production Brigade, completely changing the face of this famous backward brigade in the county. As for the mistakes he made in Boli County, they were five years ago and have been dealt with by the organization. Looking at this cadre comprehensively and historically, his mistakes, although serious, do not make him an anti-Party and anti-socialist element. In late December last year, we supported him in a debate with the conservative faction. Based on this analysis, we boldly approached him, understood him, and helped him.

During our contact, he said to us, "I have been a leading cadre longer than Comrade Liu Bingheng, and I have made more mistakes. To stand up and make a revolution with the revolutionary faction, can the revolutionary faction trust me?" We expressed to him, "We Red Guards, according to Chairman Mao's policy of 'punishing the past and curing the future, treating the illness and saving the person,' welcome cadres who have made mistakes as long as they sincerely inspect and thoroughly correct their mistakes." After several discussions, Comrade Na Xingya was greatly encouraged.

When Comrade Liu Bingheng was struggled against and beaten by the rightists and conservatives, Comrade Na Xingya published a letter he wrote to Chairman Mao, expressing his support for Comrade Liu Bingheng's revolutionary actions and exposing the anti-Party crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee. The head of "Fire Sea" gnashed his teeth and said, "Na Xingya is rotten, new and old accounts will be settled, and he will be severely beaten!" They labeled Comrade Na Xingya as a "capitalist-roader" and struggled against him, and detained him; we rescued him. This action made Comrade Na Xingya further align with the revolutionary faction.

The publication of the fourth issue of *Red Flag* editorial "We Must Correctly Treat Cadres" greatly encouraged Comrade Na Xingya. When he read, "Our purpose in exposing mistakes and criticizing shortcomings is, like a doctor treating a disease, completely to save people, not to kill people," he was moved to tears and said, "At every critical moment of the revolution, Chairman Mao always points out the direction for us cadres, and for us cadres who have made mistakes, he cares for us and tells us what to do and what not to do. Chairman Mao, I will not let you down, I will resolutely stand on your proletarian revolutionary line and fight against the counter-revolutionary revisionists to the end. I will regard myself as a revolutionary force and also as a revolutionary object, and in the struggle, I will reform myself."

After Comrade Na Xingya stood up, in addition to writing a large number of materials exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee, the revolutionary faction also let him work in the production team and played a very good role. He said, "The reason I can stand up is completely due to the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the help of revolutionary comrades. I will firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary faction and follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end!"

IV

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current survival and benefit future development, often adopt the strategy of 'attacking to defend.' 'They are always studying strategies to deal with us, 'spying out the direction,' seeking to succeed. Sometimes they will 'play dead and lie down,' waiting for the opportunity to 'counterattack.' They have long experience in class struggle, and they will engage in various forms of struggle—legal struggle and illegal struggle. We revolutionary party members must understand their tricks, must study their strategies, so as to defeat them." In the struggle to win over and unite the majority of cadres, we repeatedly studied and understood Chairman Mao's teachings.

It is wrong and against Mao Zedong Thought to suspect and exclude everything without distinguishing between right and wrong regarding cadres; similarly, it is also wrong and against Mao Zedong Thought to affirm everything and unite everything without class analysis, pursuing "unity in duality." For those cadres who stand up and reveal themselves, we must make concrete analyses to see if they are truly revolutionary or fake revolutionaries.

There is a vice minister in the county party committee who was particularly "active" in several cadre meetings. Is he really going to stand up and make a revolution? We made a comprehensive analysis of him. He had participated in various conspiracies planned by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county party committee. However, in his speeches, he not only did not expose these conspiracies but even deceived us by saying, "I am a vice minister, neither a member of the county party committee nor a favorite of the capitalist-roaders. I know nothing, and they won't tell me anything." He returned to his department and gave advice to the conservative organizations. These facts prove that he is a two-faced person. Based on the masses' exposure, we criticized him.

In short, in implementing Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and winning over and uniting the majority of cadres, we must resolutely struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line and resolutely struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Only in this way can we truly unite the majority of cadres and better achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    坚决执行毛主席的干部政策
    黑龙江省依兰县红色造反者
    《红旗》杂志编者按：黑龙江省依兰县红色造反者贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策的经验，具有普遍意义，值得各地的无产阶级革命派学习。
    黑龙江依兰县红色造反者的经验告诉我们：贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，是同资产阶级反动路线斗争的过程，是同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的过程。
    提出资产阶级反动路线的人，要包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一方面把革命群众打成“反革命”，一方面对要起来革命、起来揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的干部采取“打倒一切”的做法。我们要正确贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，就必须彻底揭露和批判资产阶级反动路线，使大批受资产阶级反动路线迫害的干部解放出来。
    我们要坚决支持革命的领导干部，起来带头闹革命，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，则恶毒地挑动不明真相的群众斗争首先站出来的革命领导干部。我们必须坚决粉碎他们的这种阴谋，这对于发动广大干部起来革命具有十分重要的意义。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，还指使他们的同伙，伪装“革命”，混进革命“三结合”的权力机构，以此达到破坏革命的目的。对于他们的这种阴谋，我们必须提高警惕。
    我们依兰县红色造反者在夺权斗争中，坚决贯彻毛主席的干部政策，逐步实现了革命的“三结合”。三月七日，我们夺取了依兰县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，宣告依兰县革命委员会的成立。
    为了争取和团结大多数干部，为了实现革命的“三结合”，我们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    一
    依兰县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在运动一开始，就推行一条资产阶级反动路线，指使一些人在县委、县人委机关中建立“火海”战斗团、“革命派造反联合总部”等御用组织，同革命派组织红卫兵总部相对抗。为了压制革命，他们挥舞着“四条棒子”：“调皮捣蛋”的不准革命；家庭出身不好的不准革命；过去犯过错误的不准革命；当权派不准革命。
    毛泽东思想是威力无穷的，广大干部的革命精神也是用“棒子”打不倒的。副县长刘秉恒同志首先站出来了。他公开支持红色造反者，并揭露了县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。在刘秉恒同志的革命行动影响下，许多革命干部纷纷准备站出来革命。这时，县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派着慌了，他们指使那些保字号的组织斗争刘秉恒同志，企图迫使他屈服，堵住这个缺口。同时，他们经过周密策划，对县机关副科级以上的干部，下了许多不准革命的禁令，把全县一百九十余名副科级以上的中层干部，不分青红皂白，一律排斥，让他们一律靠边站。妄图用这个办法来孤立革命派，破坏文化大革命。
    我们用毛泽东思想识破了敌人的阴谋。我们认为，在毛主席和党中央的领导下，大多数的干部都是好的和比较好的。那种认为凡是当权派都是坏的，都要打倒的做法，是资产阶级反动路线的产物。
    他们让副科级以上干部一律靠边站，我们就来个针锋相对，向这些干部宣传毛泽东思想和党的方针政策。我们在二月十四日召开了全县副科级以上中层干部会议。会上组织他们学习有关的文件，宣布那些不准他们革命的禁令是无效的，要求革命的干部大胆地站出来，在群众中亮相，同时，号召犯了错误的干部放下包袱，揭发敌人的罪行，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。经过一系列工作，这些干部基本上发动起来了。
    为了争取和团结大多数干部，最大限度地孤立党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在充分发动群众的基础上，我们对县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行面对面的斗争。通过斗争，广大受蒙蔽的干部觉悟了，纷纷揭发和控诉走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。广大革命干部的阶级觉悟进一步提高了。他们以忠于毛泽东思想的实际行动，彻底粉碎了敌人企图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋诡计。
    二  
    在资产阶级反动路线的压制下，许多革命领导干部还不敢站出来的时候，树立一个敢于斗争、敢于革命的样板，对于粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋，鼓舞广大领导干部站出来革命，有着重要的作用。
    今年一月二十五日，县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，纠集了一些保守派和右派搞了假夺权。这时，摆在我们面前的问题是，能不能从现有的领导干部中，找到一个真正支持革命派的人带头，同我们一起战斗，粉碎阶级敌人的假夺权。我们对几个领导干部都进行了分析，选择了刘秉恒同志。他过去是受县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派排斥打击的；在无产阶级文化大革命中，他敢于接近革命派，支持革命派。于是，我们经过多次同他交谈，证明刘秉恒同志是一个好干部。他也表示坚决支持我们的革命行动。他说：“我决不辜负毛主席的教导和同志们的帮助！”
    一月二十九日，县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，眼看革命派力量越来越强大，他们的垮台的日子即将来临，竟然挑动不明真相的农民群众进城，企图赶走从哈尔滨来支持我们革命的同志，捣毁我们的红卫兵总部。在这阶级斗争的紧要关头，刘秉恒同志挺身而出，在大会上坚决支持红色造反者，并且揭露了县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义的滔天罪行。刘秉恒同志这个革命行动，打乱了阶级敌人的部署，鼓舞了正要站出来革命的干部。阶级敌人对刘秉恒同志恨之入骨，在他站出来的当天，就指使人把他找去斗，企图迫使他放弃支持革命派的观点。但是，刘秉恒同志毫不屈服。他说：“红卫兵总部是革命派，我坚决支持他们！”阶级敌人还要刘秉恒同志写“检讨”，他坚定地表示：“我没有错，我认为我的行动是革命的行动！”阶级敌人老羞成怒，限制他的正当的人身自由。刘秉恒同志仍然没有屈服。他在《毛主席语录》上写下了这样的誓言：“一九六七年一月二十九日，为了捍卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，上刀山，下火海，我心不惊，面不改色，主动去做，直接去干，阶级敌人的硬招、软招，叫它见鬼去吧！”
    《红旗》第三期社论发表了。刘秉恒同志听到了毛主席和党中央的声音，全身增添了无穷的力量。这时，县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，又煽动一批不明真相的农民开大会斗争他。刘秉恒同志就利用这个机会，向受蒙骗的农民兄弟揭穿敌人的阴谋。敌人说他“放毒”，三次强迫他停止发言。到会的农民见到这种情形，明白了事实真相，纷纷站起来质问：“你们为什么不让人家讲话？你们有鬼！”结果，阶级敌人搬起石头砸了自己的脚，他们的阴谋破产了。
    革命派积极支持和鼓励刘秉恒同志的革命斗争。当敌人要进一步迫害刘秉恒同志时，我们把他救出来，保证了他的安全。我们同他在生死与共的战斗中，结下了战斗的友谊。
    刘秉恒同志的革命行动，对依兰县的广大干部起了带头作用。刘秉恒同志站出来之后，用自己的亲身经历和体会，找了许多犯了错误而愿意革命的干部谈话，鼓励他们起来革命。许多领导干部也纷纷到刘秉恒同志家里串连。这就使得一个又一个的革命干部站出来革命。
    三
    我们对犯有严重错误的干部，坚定不移地执行毛主席的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针。
    县委常委、县长那兴亚同志到底是什么样的干部呢？毛主席教导我们：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”我们遵照毛主席的教导，对那兴亚同志的问题作了全面的历史的分析。那兴亚同志在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，虽然也执行过资产阶级反动路线，平时突出政治不够好，斗争性不强，在勃利县也犯过思想作风方面的严重错误。但是，从他的全部历史看，基本上是好的。他从一九六二年来依兰县后，其中有三年时间在三道冈公社永兴大队蹲点，把这个全县有名的落后队彻底改变了面貌。至于他在勃利县所犯的错误，是五年前的事，已做了组织的处理。全面地历史地来看这个干部，他的错误虽然严重，但不是反党反社会主义分子。在去年十二月下旬，我们同保守派组织在一次辩论中，他支持了我们。基于这种分析，我们即大胆地接近他，了解他，帮助他。
    在接触中，他对我们说：“我做领导工作的时间比刘秉恒同志长，错误比他多，要站出来，和革命派一起革命，革命派能不能信任？”我们向他表示：“我们红色造反者按照毛主席讲的‘惩前毖后、治病救人’的政策，对犯错误的干部，只要认真检查，彻底改正，就热情欢迎。”经过几次谈话，那兴亚受到很大鼓舞。
    在刘秉恒同志遭到右派和保守派的斗争和毒打时，那兴亚同志公布了他写给毛主席的信，表示支持刘秉恒同志的革命行动，揭露了县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反党罪行。“火海”的头子看到这封信，咬牙切齿地说：“那兴亚坏透了，新账老账要一齐算，狠狠地打！”他们给那兴亚同志扣上了
  “走资本主义道路当权派”的帽子，进行斗争，并押了起来；我们把他救了出来。这一行动，使那兴亚同志进一步和革命派靠拢了。
    《红旗》第四期社论《必须正确地对待干部》的发表，给那兴亚同志极大的鼓舞。当他读到“我们揭发错误、批判缺点的目的，好象医生治病一样，完全是为了救人，而不是为了把人整死”时，感动得淌下了眼泪，他说：“每到革命的关键时刻，毛主席总是对我们干部指出方向，对于我们犯错误的干部关怀备至，告诉我们应该怎么做，不应该怎么做。毛主席，我决不辜负你老人家的期望，坚决站在你的无产阶级革命路线方面来，与反革命修正主义分子斗争到底。把自己当做一份革命力量，也当作革命对象，在斗争中改造自己。”
    那兴亚同志站出来以后，除写了大量揭发县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的材料外，革命派让他在生产班子中抓工作，也发挥了很好的作用。他说：“我所以能站出来，这完全是毛泽东思想的教导，是革命派同志们帮助的结果。我要坚定不移地站到革命派一边，跟毛主席革命到底！”
    四
    毛主席教导我们说：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处于不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”“他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。”我们在争取和团结大多数干部的斗争中，认真反复地学习和领会毛主席这个教导。
    对干部不分青红皂白，怀疑一切，排斥一切，打倒一切，是错误的，违反毛泽东思想的；同样，不加阶级分析，肯定一切，联合一切，搞“合二而一”，也是错误的，违反毛泽东思想的。对于那些站出来亮相的干部，我们要做具体分析，看一看他是真革命还是假革命。
    县委有一个副部长，在几次干部会议上发言特别“积极”。他是不是真的要站出来革命呢？我们对他做了全面分析。他曾经参与了县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所策划的种种阴谋。可是他在发言中，对这些阴谋不但不揭发，甚至还欺骗我们说：“我是一个副部长，既不是县委委员，又不是走资本主义道路当权派的红人，我什么事情也不知道，他们有什么事也不会和我讲。”他回到部里，还给保守派组织出谋划策。这些事实，证明他是一个两面派。我们根据群众的揭发，对他进行了批判。
    总之，在贯彻毛主席的干部政策，争取和团结大多数干部的工作中，必须同资产阶级反动路线坚决斗争，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派坚决斗争，才能真正团结干部的大多数，才能更好地实现革命的“三结合”，把无产阶级文化大革命运动进行到底。
