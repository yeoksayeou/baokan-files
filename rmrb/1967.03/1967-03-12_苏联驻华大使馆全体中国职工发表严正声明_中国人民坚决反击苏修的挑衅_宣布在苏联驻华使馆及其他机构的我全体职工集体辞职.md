All Chinese staff at the Soviet Embassy in China issue a solemn declaration
Chinese people resolutely counter Soviet revisionists' provocation
Announce collective resignation of all Chinese staff at the Soviet Embassy in China and other institutions

New China News Agency, March 11th: On March 6th, all Chinese staff working at the Soviet Embassy in China issued a declaration strongly protesting the Soviet Embassy in China's disregard for Chinese laws and the legitimate rights of the Chinese working class, as well as their unjust dismissals and persecution of Chinese staff. The declaration pointed out that the actions of the Soviet Embassy in China are a serious provocation against the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, and they will bear full responsibility for the consequences. The declaration announced that starting from March 6th, all Chinese staff working at the Soviet Embassy in China and other Soviet institutions in China will take unified action and collectively resign.

The declaration stated that on January 25th, the Soviet revisionist leadership sent military police to brutally suppress Chinese students in Europe who were paying their respects at Lenin's Mausoleum. Upon hearing the news, all Chinese staff working at the Soviet Embassy in China and other Soviet institutions in China were filled with indignation and on the 27th announced a collective strike to express their protest. Subsequently, the Soviet revisionist leadership intentionally escalated the situation, leading to further incidents such as Soviet diplomats at the Soviet Embassy in Iraq assaulting Chinese students in Iraq, and organized Soviet thugs breaking into the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, smashing newsstands, and assaulting Chinese diplomatic representatives and embassy staff. We are filled with profound outrage and have twice announced strikes to express our strong protest. After each strike, we have repeatedly returned to the Soviet Embassy in China to resume work and negotiate, but have been rudely rejected by the Soviet side. To this day, the Soviet Embassy in China shows no sign of repentance.

The declaration pointed out that where there is oppression, there is resistance; where there is provocation, there is counterattack. Our staff's strike to protest the Soviet revisionists' barbaric acts and to support our fellow class members who have been harmed is a completely just and revolutionary action, and it is a sacred and inviolable political right granted to us by our country's constitution, which no one has the right to interfere with. The declaration said that after the strike, we promptly returned to the Soviet Embassy in China to resume work, which is a matter of course. However, the Soviet Embassy blatantly disregarded Chinese laws and the legitimate rights of the Chinese working class, rudely rejecting our request to resume work. They acted like bourgeois masters, threatening us, "You have the right not to work, and we have the right to dismiss you," and on February 2nd, they formally notified our diplomatic personnel service bureau of their decision to dismiss all Chinese staff. The Soviet side's unilateral decision is a political retaliation against our strike to protest the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist leadership, and it is illegal. To ask, is it only allowed for the Soviet revisionist leadership to beat people unjustly, but not allowed for us to strike in protest? We firmly oppose this bourgeois robber logic and oppose treating us with the methods capitalists use to treat the working class. It is particularly worth noting that since the founding of New China, no foreign embassy in China has unilaterally dismissed Chinese staff, yet the Soviet Embassy has set a precedent in Chinese territory of disregarding Chinese laws and insulting the Chinese working class. This is a serious provocation against the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, and the Soviet Embassy in China will bear full responsibility for the consequences.

The declaration said that to prevent us from resuming work, the Soviet Embassy has used all sorts of tricks and thug tactics. First, they refused to meet with staff who came to resume work, then they repeatedly delayed negotiations. During the negotiations on February 3rd, Second Secretary Nadashin even personally attacked our staff representative, Guo Junsheng. On the 4th, an agreement was reached to continue negotiations on the 6th, and Second Secretary Nadashin had promised, "Soviet diplomats keep their word; if we do not negotiate on Monday (the 6th) at 3 PM, you can cut off my head!" However, when we showed up as agreed, the Soviet side not only used the excuse of "not receiving visitors for three days" to go back on their word and refuse to meet with us, but also organized more than ten burly men, some of whom were armed with wooden sticks, to threaten and provoke us at the embassy entrance. One of them even punched Guo Junsheng. It was only because we took a very restrained attitude that the situation did not escalate. Recently, due to being at a loss for words and unable to come up with any valid reasons, the relevant personnel of the Soviet Embassy have adopted a rogue attitude of refusing to answer questions from staff who came to resume work. It is particularly worth noting that the Soviet side, disregarding the facts, has slandered Chinese staff who came to the embassy with entry permits issued by the Soviet Embassy as "thugs who broke into the embassy premises to cause trouble," fully exposing their reactionary stance of hostility towards the Chinese people.

The declaration emphasized that up to now, we have patiently negotiated with the Soviet Embassy in China for more than a month to resume work. However, the Soviet Embassy in China, disregarding our just demands, stubbornly insists on its erroneous position and resolutely implements the "collective dismissal" of Chinese staff. This is a violation of our country's laws, a blatant mockery, insult, and persecution of Chinese staff. They have once again committed an unforgivable crime against the Chinese people. We strongly protest against the above actions. We solemnly declare that starting from March 6th, all Chinese staff working at the Soviet Embassy in China and other Soviet institutions in China will take unified action and collectively resign.

The declaration said that the great Soviet people are the most intimate brothers of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. The Soviet revisionist leadership is further intensifying its reactionary foreign policy of aligning with the United States against China, crazily persecuting and dismissing Chinese staff, which is the greatest insult and betrayal of the Soviet people. The Soviet people will not forgive them, the Chinese people will not forgive them, and the revolutionary people of the world will not forgive them.

The declaration concluded by saying that our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, taught us: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are also such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote broader and more intense revolutions among the people." The foolish acts of the Soviet revisionist leadership will further expose their traitorous faces of revisionism, promoting the broader and faster awakening of the revolutionary people of the world. Soviet revisionism is doomed to fail, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are bound to triumph.

    苏联驻华大使馆全体中国职工发表严正声明
    中国人民坚决反击苏修的挑衅
    宣布在苏联驻华使馆及其他机构的我全体职工集体辞职
    新华社十一日讯　在苏联驻中国大使馆工作的全体中国职工六日发表声明，强烈抗议苏联驻中国大使馆无视中国法律和中国工人阶级的正当权利，无理解雇和迫害中国职工。声明指出，苏联驻中国大使馆的行为，是对中国工人阶级和中国人民的严重挑衅，它要对其后果负全部责任。声明宣布，从三月六日起，在苏联驻中国大使馆及苏联其他驻中国机构工作的全体中国职工一致行动，集体辞职。
    声明说，一月二十五日，苏联修正主义领导集团出动军警，血腥镇压我拜谒列宁墓的中国留欧学生。消息传来，在苏联驻中国大使馆和苏联其他驻中国机构工作的全体中国职工，义愤填膺，在二十七日宣布集体罢工，表示抗议。随后，苏联修正主义领导集团蓄意扩大事端，又连续发生苏联驻伊拉克使馆外交官员殴打我留伊学生，及苏联有组织的暴徒闯入中国驻苏联大使馆，砸毁新闻橱窗，殴打我国外交代表和使馆工作人员的血腥事件。我们以万分愤慨的心情，连续两次宣布罢工，表示强烈的抗议。每次罢工期满后，我们均曾多次去苏联驻中国大使馆进行复工并交涉，但均遭苏方蛮横拒绝。至今苏联驻中国大使馆仍毫无悔改之意。
    声明指出，有压迫就有反抗，有挑衅就有反击。我们职工罢工抗议苏修的野蛮暴行，声援自己受害的阶级弟兄，这完全是正义的、革命的行动，也是我国宪法赋予我们的神圣不可侵犯的政治权利，不容任何人干涉。声明说，罢工期满后，我们及时到苏联驻中国大使馆复工是理所当然的事。但是苏联大使馆竟然无视中国法律和中国工人阶级的正当权利，悍然拒绝我们复工。他们摆出一副资产阶级老爷的架势，恶狠狠地对我们说，“你们有权不工作，我们就有权解雇”，并且于二月二日正式向我外交人员服务局发出解雇全体中国职工的通知。苏方这一片面决定，完全是对我们罢工抗议苏联修正主义领导集团法西斯暴行的政治报复，是非法的。试问，只许苏修领导集团无理打人，难道就不许我们罢工抗议吗？我们坚决反对这种资产阶级的强盗逻辑，反对用资本家对待工人阶级的办法来对待我们。特别应该指出，自新中国建立以来，还没有一个外国驻中国使馆单方面集体解雇过中国职工，而苏联使馆竟然在中国国土上开创这样无视中国法律和侮辱中国工人阶级的先例。这是对中国工人阶级和中国人民的严重挑衅，苏联驻中国大使馆要对其后果负全部责任的。
    声明说，苏联使馆为了拒绝我们复工，耍尽了阴谋和流氓手段，先是拒不接见去复工的职工，继而一再拖延谈判时间。二月三日谈判时，二等秘书那达申甚至对我职工代表郭俊生同志进行了人身攻击。四日达成六日继续谈判的协议，苏方二等秘书那达申曾提出保证说：“苏联外交官说话是算数的，星期一（六日）下午三时如果不谈，你们可割下我的脑袋！”但在我们如期赴约时，苏方不仅以“三天不会客”为借口，自食其言，拒绝会见，而且由叶达诺夫亲自组织了十多个彪形大汉，其中有的手持木棍等凶器，挤在使馆门口对我们进行威胁和挑衅，其中一人还打了郭俊生同志一拳。只是由于我们采取了十分克制的态度，才没有使事态扩大。最近，苏联使馆的有关人员，由于理屈词穷，说不出半点正当理由，又对我去复工的职工采取了拒不答复问题的无赖态度。特别应当指出的是，苏联方面竟然不顾事实，把拿着苏联使馆签发的出入证到大使馆去谈判复工的中国职工，诬蔑为“闯入大使馆领域”去“胡作非为的暴徒”，这就彻底暴露了他们与中国人民为敌的反动立场。
    声明强调说，到目前为止，我们已经同苏联驻中国大使馆耐心地进行了为时一个多月的复工谈判。但是苏联驻中国大使馆不顾我们的正义要求，顽固地坚持他们的错误立场，坚决实行对中国职工的“集体解雇”。这是对我国法律的破坏，是明目张胆地对中国职工的戏弄、侮辱和迫害。他们又一次对中国人民犯下了不可饶恕的罪行。对以上种种，我们特向苏联驻中国大使馆提出强烈的抗议。我们并郑重宣布，从三月六日起，我全体在苏联驻中国大使馆及苏联其他驻中国机构工作的中国职工一致行动，集体辞职。
    声明说，伟大的苏联人民是我们中国工人阶级和中国人民最亲密的兄弟。苏联修正主义领导集团进一步加紧推行联美反华的反动的对外政策，疯狂地迫害和解雇中国职工，这是对苏联人民的最大侮辱和背叛。苏联人民不会饶恕他们，中国人民不会饶恕他们，全世界的革命人民也不会饶恕他们的。
    声明最后说，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”苏联修正主义领导集团所作的这些蠢事，将更加暴露他们的修正主义叛徒嘴脸，将促进世界革命人民更广泛、更迅速的觉醒。苏联修正主义必败，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想必胜。
