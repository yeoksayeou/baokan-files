Edition: 1

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress was held on March 22, 1967, in the presence of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao. The congress was convened at a time when our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution had achieved brilliant victories, and when the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of revolutionary workers was soaring high after the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country."

The congress was tasked with the glorious mission of mobilizing revolutionary workers in all factories and mines in the city to fully display their sense of responsibility as masters of the state. They were to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and the great call of the Party Central Committee, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to fully utilize the positive factors mobilized by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They were to redouble their efforts and strive for the best, launching a new high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production."

The congress expressed the common wish of all revolutionary workers in the city's factories and mines: to extend our most sincere wishes to our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao for a long life!

The representatives present solemnly pledged: to always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The congress announced: before the convening of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress would be the highest authority of the revolutionary workers' organizations in the city. During the recess of the congress, a standing committee would be established to handle daily work.

The congress expressed its highest respect to the revolutionary workers who had steadfastly adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and had made immortal contributions during the Cultural Revolution. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all revolutionary workers in the city, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, had launched a fierce struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, and against the ghosts and monsters in society. They had criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, curbed the evil wind of counter-revolutionary economism, and firmly supported Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For the sake of defending Chairman Mao, defending the great thought of Mao Zedong, and defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary workers dared to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire. It was precisely because they had displayed this great revolutionary spirit and actively engaged in the struggle that, in a few months, all fronts of industry, transportation, urban construction, and commerce and trade in the city had undergone earth-shaking changes, presenting a prosperous revolutionary scene.

The congress pointed out: the class struggle in factories and mines is still very intense. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated factories and mines, are using various means to sow discord, create trouble, sabotage production, and carry out a counterattack and reversal. They are trying to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must not be complacent or relax our vigilance.

To implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," to complete the various combat tasks proposed in the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country," and to strive for victory in both revolution and production, the congress passed the following resolution:

Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is the greatest revolution of the 1960s. This revolution aims to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to prevent the restoration of capitalism. This revolution determines the fate of the proletarian dictatorship state and the fate of the revolutionary cause of the proletariat and oppressed nations worldwide. This revolution has opened a new era in the history of the international communist movement.

We, the working class, are the leading force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, we must unite all revolutionary forces to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is our duty.

Now, the question before the working class and the people of the whole country is whether to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end or to abandon it halfway. In the face of this question, the working class has only one choice, one answer, and one resolution: to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

We should become models in resolutely implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and in criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories, while the bourgeois reactionary line has suffered a miserable defeat. However, we must be soberly aware that the bourgeois reactionary line has its social base and class forces that maintain and implement this line. These are mainly the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and those whose worldview has not been fundamentally transformed. Therefore, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating its poisonous influence is a long-term and arduous task, a serious political struggle. At present, there is a small handful of people who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, carrying out a counterattack and reversal. This small handful of people maliciously distort the revolutionary policy of the "three-in-one combination," whitewashing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, crying injustice, and attempting a counter-revolutionary restoration; they confuse right and wrong, strike at the revolutionary masses, and attempt to overturn the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the working class, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, must resolutely repel the counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, continue to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line until it is completely criticized and overturned, and fight it until it is completely defeated! No matter what storms and rapids we encounter on the road ahead, we, the working class, will always follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, firmly support the correct leadership of Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and firmly support the correct leadership of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Whoever opposes our great leader Chairman Mao, opposes the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and opposes the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we, the working class, will resolutely rebel against them and rebel to the end!

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee hope that we will "become models in resolutely implementing the decisions of the Party Central Committee on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." We, the working class, will definitely do so. We will definitely resolutely, comprehensively, and without any compromise implement all the decisions and instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, display the spirit of daring to think, speak, act, make revolution, and rebel, and launch a fierce struggle against the old world. At the same time, we will continuously improve our struggle tactics and fully embody the high revolutionary spirit and high scientific spirit in the decisions and instructions of the Party Central Committee.

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee hope that we will "become models in struggling against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." We, the working class, will definitely do so. We will definitely overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will definitely seize back the Party power, state power, economic power, and cultural power that have been usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and gradually establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian temporary power organ in the struggle. For a long time, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the city's factories and mines have implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee. This counter-revolutionary revisionist line has stubbornly resisted the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, fiercely opposed and slandered the great thought of Mao Zedong, fiercely opposed political command, fiercely opposed the socialist production and management policies in factories and mines, and brought in the capitalist and revisionist trash into our factories and mines, causing extremely bad effects. We must thoroughly eliminate these influences. We must completely overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee and ensure that it never rises again!

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee hope that we will "become models in implementing great unity, in opposing factionalism, anarchism, extremism, economism, and selfishness." We, the working class, will definitely do so. We must remember Marx's words: the proletariat must not only liberate itself but also liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself. We must use the proletarian worldview to look at the great unity of the revolution. The great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries is an urgent need for the current revolutionary struggle. Only by achieving the great unity of the revolution can we successfully seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, isolate the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road and all ghosts and monsters, mobilize the broad masses of people to implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Therefore, every revolutionary worker must always think about the great unity of the revolution and contribute their strength to it. We must not say anything that is not conducive to the great unity of the revolution; we must not do anything that is not conducive to the great unity of the revolution. We must use the great thought of Mao Zedong as the soul of the great unity of the revolution. We must use the great thought of Mao Zedong as a guide, implement open rectification, and overcome the erroneous tendencies of factionalism, anarchism, extremism, economism, and selfishness in our minds and ranks. We must build the ranks of the working class into a highly revolutionary and combat-ready force. At present, city-wide, cross-unit, cross-department, and cross-system workers' organizations are not conducive to the great struggle of "grasp revolution, promote production" and should be implemented according to units, departments, and systems. The establishment of workers' organizations must be conducive to "grasp revolution, promote production," conducive to the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, and conducive to the revolutionary transformation of the thoughts of all members.

We, the working class, must clearly recognize that throughout the entire historical period of transition from capitalism to communism, there will always be a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and a struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for power. We must consciously participate in the cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie and push this revolution to complete and thorough victory. We must always advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, block the road to the restoration of capitalism, and ensure that our socialist state remains unshakable for generations to come.

Launch a New High Tide of Production

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to revolutionize people's thoughts, thereby making all work done better, faster, and more efficiently.

We, the working class, are the leading force in socialist construction. We must become the most outstanding models of "grasp revolution, promote production" for the laboring masses in the current stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must be down-to-earth and work hard in production and construction, quickly launching a new high tide of production. To this end, we must pay attention to and seriously do the following:

1. Redouble our efforts and strive for the best, completing and overfulfilling the national production and construction plans. We must display the high sense of responsibility of the masters of the state, ensure product quality, and strive for high-quality products. We must fight against some bad practices that disregard quality and waste state resources. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and the departments of industry, transportation, and commerce and trade must actively support agriculture.

2. Establish and strengthen the command posts on the production front lines. In all factories and mines in the city that need to seize power, we must mobilize the masses to seize power and establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ to lead the work of revolution and production. This temporary power organ must have a strong production command system to firmly grasp production. In units where the temporary power organ has not been established and the leading cadre is weak or dispersed, revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and armed cadres must step forward to form a command post on the production front line, especially to establish a unified command system at the factory level, to unify the deployment of manpower, materials, and funds, and to ensure the smooth progress of production. All levels of leading cadres must use the thought of Mao Zedong as the banner, mobilize all positive factors, and firmly grasp production. After the leading cadre is established, revolutionary workers must actively support it, obey the leadership, and follow the commands, without hindering the work of the production cadre.

3. Strengthen proletarian labor discipline. All revolutionary workers in the city must implement the regulations of the Party Central Committee, adhere to the eight-hour workday, and modelly observe labor discipline. In their spare time, they must actively carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and during production and work time, they must concentrate on doing a good job in production and work. They must not use production and work time for linking up, writing big-character posters, and debates. No worker should, under the pretext of different participating organizations, different viewpoints, or differing opinions, engage in slacking off, sabotaging production cooperation, sabotaging revolutionary discipline, and reasonable labor systems in production and work. Those who insist on such errors and cause damage in production and work should be given necessary punishments. No one is allowed to leave their production and work posts at will during production time. Those who have been away from their production and work posts for a long time should quickly return to their original units to participate in production and work, otherwise, they should be subject to disciplinary action.

4. Be thrifty and make revolution. All revolutionary workers in the city must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and make revolution" and resolutely implement the policy of "thrift in running enterprises." All factories and mines must do everything possible to save manpower, materials, and funds. They must seriously study the experience of streamlining administration. In workers' organizations, generally, no full-time personnel should be set up. Administrative expenses and all non-production expenditures should be reduced as much as possible.

All revolutionary workers in the city must continue to wage an uncompromising struggle against counter-revolutionary economism and resolutely defend socialist economy. The living allowances and wages of workers must be handled according to the current state regulations, and no one is allowed to change them privately. The unreasonable parts will be reformed according to state policies after the movement.

5. Carry out technological innovation and technological revolution. All revolutionary workers in the city must have great aspirations, set high goals, break superstitions, liberate their minds, display pioneering spirit in production, carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and catch up with or surpass the world's advanced technological level.

Scientific and technological personnel must go out of their offices, go deep into production practice, combine with workers, engage in product design, strengthen scientific experiments, and scale the heights of scientific and technological achievements.

6. Reform the management system. The counter-revolutionary revisionist management system and the huge bureaucratic organizations established by the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee in many factories and mines in Beijing must be thoroughly reformed. We must mobilize the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and re-establish a socialist management system and management organization. We must firmly abolish regulations and systems that shackle the development of productive forces and firmly implement reasonable regulations and systems.

7. Learn from the People's Liberation Army and closely cooperate with it. The Party Central Committee has decided that the People's Liberation Army will greatly assist the local areas, support industrial production, and support the revolutionary leftists. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and support for us and an important guarantee for us to achieve victory in both revolution and production. We must sincerely learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from their high举毛泽东思想伟大红旗,突出无产阶级政治,狠抓思想革命化的宝贵经验; learn from their high-spirited service to the people; learn from their spirit of overcoming all difficulties and fearing no sacrifice; and learn from their fine tradition of hard work and plain living. Whoever dares to point the spearhead at the glorious People's Liberation Army of China, we will not agree!

8. Strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. All revolutionary workers in various factories and mines in the city must be vigilant and, in accordance with the "Several Regulations on Strengthening Public Security Work During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, strengthen security work. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the factories must not make trouble. Those who sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and sabotage production must be punished according to law.

Promote the Movement of Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works to a New Stage

To use the thought of Mao Zedong as the banner, to achieve the revolutionary transformation of people's thoughts, is the fundamental guarantee for carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in production, and the fundamental guarantee for running enterprises and all undertakings well. We must use the thought of Mao Zedong to command production and command all work. Since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all revolutionary workers in the city have greatly strengthened their study and application of Chairman Mao's works and achieved remarkable results. However, we must not be the least bit complacent. The idea that the working class can spontaneously grasp the thought of Mao Zedong and thus lower the requirements for study is completely wrong. Comrade Lin Biao said: "The thought of Mao Zedong reflects the objective laws of class struggle at home and abroad and reflects the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people. The thought of Mao Zedong is not spontaneously produced by the working people but is the brilliant inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao on the basis of great revolutionary practice. It is the summation of new experiences in the international communist movement, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage."

"Therefore, we must, through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, infuse Chairman Mao's thought into the workers and peasants, to change the spiritual face of the working people, and to turn spiritual strength into a great material force." We must, with a thousand times the enthusiasm, actively carry out the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the workers and raise it to a new stage. We must achieve new levels of study. All revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in factories and mines in the city must take the "Three Articles" as their motto, bring problems to study the brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Opposing Liberalism," and "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" repeatedly, break down the "self" and establish the "public," and do a good job in the revolutionary transformation of thoughts. The "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country" is Chairman Mao's latest and highest instruction. Every revolutionary worker and revolutionary cadre must implement the spirit of this document in their actual actions. Through the Cultural Revolution, we must turn factories and mines into great schools of the thought of Mao Zedong. We must let the great red flag of the thought of Mao Zedong fly over every factory, every mine, and every enterprise in Beijing, and over every inch of land in Beijing.

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress believes that, under the guidance of the thought of Mao Zedong, all revolutionary workers in the city will definitely be able to complete their glorious mission and definitely be able to achieve victory in both revolution and production!

    北京市革命职工代表会议决议
    永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，同贫下中农一道，联合一切革命力量，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，掀起“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。
    新华社二十三日讯　北京市革命职工代表会议三月二十二日通过决议，全文如下：
    一九六七年三月二十二日，北京市革命职工代表会议在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的身边胜利召开了。
    这个会议是在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得辉煌胜利的时刻召开的，是在《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》公布以后，广大革命职工的革命热情极为高涨的时刻召开的。
    这个会议的光荣任务是：动员全市厂矿企业革命职工发扬国家主人翁的伟大责任感，坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，响应党中央的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，并且充分利用无产阶级文化大革命所调动起来的积极因素，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，掀起“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮。
    会议表达全市厂矿企业革命职工的共同愿望：最衷心地祝福我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！
    到会的代表庄严地宣誓：永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    会议宣布：在全市革命职工代表大会成立以前，北京市革命职工代表会议是全市革命职工组织的最高权力机构。在会议闭幕期间设立一个常设委员会，负责处理日常工作。
    会议向坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，在文化大革命中立下了不朽功勋的革命职工表示崇高的敬意。在无产阶级文化大革命中，全市广大革命职工，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，大造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造了社会上牛鬼蛇神的反，批判了资产阶级反动路线，煞住了反革命经济主义的妖风。革命职工最听毛主席的话，最忠实于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。为了保卫毛主席，为了保卫伟大的毛泽东思想，为了保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，革命职工刀山敢上，火海敢闯。正是由于发扬了这种大无畏的革命精神，积极进行了斗争，几个月之间，全市的工业、交通、城建和财贸等各条战线发生了翻天覆地的变化，出现了一派欣欣向荣的大好革命形势。
    会议指出：厂矿企业中的阶级斗争仍然十分激烈。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和混进厂矿企业的地富反坏右分子，以各种方式挑拨离间，制造纠纷，破坏生产，实行反攻倒算，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。严重的阶级斗争摆在我们面前，我们务必不能麻痹大意，不能松懈自己的斗志。
    为了贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，为了完成《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》中所提出的各项战斗任务，为了争取革命和生产的双胜利，特作如下的决议：把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是二十世纪六十年代的最伟大的革命。这个革命，就是要向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，就是要巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。这个革命，决定着无产阶级专政国家的命运，决定着全世界无产阶级和被压迫民族革命事业的命运。这个革命，在国际共产主义运动的历史上开辟了一个新纪元。
    我们工人阶级是无产阶级文化大革命的领导力量。同贫下中农一道，联合一切革命力量，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，是我们义不容辞的责任。
    现在，摆在工人阶级和全国人民面前的问题，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底还是使它半途而废。在这个问题面前，我们工人阶级只有一个选择，只有一个答案，只有一个决心，就是要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    我们应该成为坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，批判资产阶级反动路线的模范。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线已经取得伟大的胜利，资产阶级反动路线已经惨败。但是，我们要清醒地认识到，资产阶级反动路线在我国有它的社会基础，有维护和执行这条路线的阶级力量。这主要的就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地富反坏右分子以及世界观没有改造好的人。因此，批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒和影响，就是一个长期的艰巨的任务，是一场严重的政治斗争。当前，有那么一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，实行反攻倒算。这一小撮人恶毒地歪曲革命的“三结合”的方针，为党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派涂脂抹粉，鸣冤叫屈，妄图实行反革命复辟；这一小撮人颠倒是非，混淆黑白，打击无产阶级革命派，妄图推翻无产阶级文化大革命已经取得的伟大成果。我们工人阶级要同贫下中农、革命的干部和革命的知识分子一道，坚决打退资产阶级反动路线的反扑，继续批判资产阶级反动路线，直到把资产阶级反动路线批倒、批臭，斗倒、斗臭！不管前进的道路上遇到怎样的惊涛骇浪和急流险滩，我们工人阶级永远跟着毛主席闹革命，坚决拥护毛主席的最亲密战友林彪副主席的正确领导，坚决拥护中央文化革命小组的正确领导。谁反对我们的伟大领袖毛主席、反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想、反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，我们工人阶级就坚决造谁的反，而且要一反到底！
    毛主席和党中央希望我们“成为坚决执行党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定的模范”。我们工人阶级一定照办。我们一定要坚决地全面地不折不扣地执行毛主席和党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的各项决定和指示，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的精神，大造旧世界的反。同时，我们也要不断地提高斗争艺术，把党中央的决定和指示中的高度的革命精神和高度的科学精神完整地体现出来。
    毛主席和党中央希望我们“成为同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争的模范”。我们工人阶级一定照办。我们一定要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，完成一斗、二批、三改的任务。我们一定要把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所篡夺的党权、政权、财权、文权统统夺过来，并在斗争中逐步建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。长期以来，全市厂矿企业中党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派执行的是旧北京市委、市人委的反革命修正主义路线。这条反革命修正主义路线，顽固地对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，疯狂地反对和诋毁伟大的毛泽东思想，疯狂地反对政治挂帅，疯狂地反对厂矿企业中社会主义的生产和经营的方针，把资本主义和修正主义的那套破烂货搬到我们的厂矿企业中来，造成了极为恶劣的影响。我们要彻底肃清这种影响。我们要把旧北京市委、市人委的反革命修正主义路线彻底打倒，让它永世不得翻身！
    毛主席和党中央希望我们“成为实行革命大联合的模范，成为反对小团体主义、反对无政府主义、反对风头主义、反对经济主义、反对自私自利的模范”。我们工人阶级一定照办。我们要记住马克思的话：无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。我们要用无产阶级的世界观来看待革命的大联合。无产阶级革命派的大联合，是当前革命斗争的迫切需要。只有实现革命的大联合，才能胜利地从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权，才能孤立走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神，才能动员广大的力量贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。因此，每一个革命职工都要时时刻刻想到革命的大联合，要为革命的大联合贡献自己的力量。凡是不利于革命的大联合的话不说；不利于革命的大联合的事不做。我们要用伟大的毛泽东思想作为革命的大联合的灵魂。要用伟大的毛泽东思想作指导，实行开门整风，克服我们自己头脑中和队伍中存在着的小团体主义、无政府主义、风头主义、经济主义和自私自利等错误倾向。我们要把工人阶级的队伍建设成一支非常革命化、非常战斗化的队伍。目前，全市性跨单位、跨部门、跨系统的职工组织已不利于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大斗争，应该实行按单位、按部门、按系统的革命大联合。革命职工组织的建立，必须有利于“抓革命，促生产”，有利于本单位的斗、批、改，有利于各组织成员思想的革命化。
    我们工人阶级一定要清楚地认识到：在从资本主义过渡到共产主义的整个历史时期，始终存在着无产阶级同资产阶级之间的斗争，存在着社会主义道路同资本主义道路之间的斗争，存在着资产阶级同无产阶级之间的夺权斗争。我们一定要自觉地参加批判资产阶级的文化大革命，一定要把这个革命推进到完全彻底的胜利。我们要永远按照毛主席所指引的方向前进，彻底地挖掉修正主义的根子，堵塞资本主义复辟的道路，使我们的社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
        掀起生产的新高潮
    无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大推动力。无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。
    我们工人阶级是社会主义建设的领导力量。我们要在无产阶级文化大革命的新条件下，成为现阶段全国劳动群众“抓革命，促生产”的最出色的模范。我们要在生产建设中脚踏实地，大干特干，迅速掀起一个生产的新高潮。为此，要注意并认真做好以下几点：
      （一）更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，完成和超额完成国家生产计划和国家建设计划。要发扬国家主人翁的高度责任感，保证产品质量，力争产品高质量。要同一些不顾质量、浪费国家资财的不良现象作斗争。农业是国民经济的基础，工业、交通和财贸等部门要积极支援农业。
      （二）建立和健全生产第一线指挥部。全市厂矿企业中凡属需要夺权的单位，要发动群众进行夺权，要建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的
  “三结合”的临时权力机构，领导革命和生产的工作。这个临时权力机构要有一个强有力的生产指挥系统，把生产切切实实抓起来。在临时权力机构尚未建立而领导班子软弱或涣散了的单位，革命职工和革命干部以及武装干部，要挺身而出，组成生产第一线指挥部，特别要建立厂部一级的统一的指挥系统，统一调度人力、物力、财力，保证生产的顺利进行。各级领导班子要用毛泽东思想挂帅，调动一切积极因素，把生产切实抓起来。在领导班子建立以后，革命职工要积极给以支持，服从领导，听从指挥，不要妨碍生产班子的工作。
    （三）巩固无产阶级的劳动纪律。全市革命职工要执行党中央的规定，坚持八小时工作制，模范地遵守劳动纪律。在业余时间要积极开展无产阶级文化大革命，在生产和工作时间要集中精力搞好生产和工作。不应占用生产和工作时间进行串连、写大字报和辩论。任何职工，不应该借口参加的组织不同、观点不同或意见分歧，而在生产和工作上消极怠工，破坏生产协作，破坏革命纪律和合理的劳动制度。如果坚持这种错误而在生产和工作上造成损害者，应给以必要的处分。不许在生产时间内，擅自离开生产和工作岗位，要同迟到、早退、缩短工时（包括商店的营业时间）和无故旷工等不良现象作斗争。擅自离开生产和工作岗位长期在外的职工，应迅速返回原单位参加生产和工作，否则，应受到纪律处分。
      （四）节约闹革命。全市革命职工要坚决响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，坚决执行“勤俭办企业”的方针。各厂矿企业要千方百计节约人力、物力、财力。要认真研究精兵简政的经验。在工人组织中，一般不要设立脱产人员。要尽量减少行政费用和一切非生产性开支。
    全市革命职工必须继续同反革命经济主义进行不调和的斗争，坚决保卫社会主义经济。职工的生活福利、工资待遇，一律按现行国家规定办，不得私自改变。其中不合理部分，在运动后期根据国家政策进行改革。
      （五）开展技术革新和技术革命。全市革命职工要树雄心，立大志，破除迷信，解放思想，在生产中发扬首创精神，开展技术革新和技术革命，赶上或超过世界先进技术水平。
    科学技术人员要走出办公室，深入到生产实践中去，和工人相结合，进行产品设计，加强科学试验，攀登科学技术的高峰。
      （六）改革管理体制。旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，在北京市许多厂矿企业建立的修正主义管理体制和庞大的官僚主义机构，我们一定要彻底改革。要发动群众，集中群众智慧，重新建立社会主义的管理体制和管理机构。对于束缚生产力发展的规章制度要坚决破除，对合理的规章制度要坚决执行。
      （七）向人民解放军学习，同人民解放军密切合作。党中央决定，人民解放军大力协助地方，支持工业生产工作，支持革命左派，这是毛主席对我们最大的关怀和最大的支持，是我们争取革命和生产双胜利的一个重要保证。我们要诚恳地向人民解放军学习，学习他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓思想革命化的宝贵经验；学习他们全心全意为人民服务的高尚品质；学习他们排除万难、不怕牺牲的革命精神和艰苦朴素的优良传统。谁胆敢把矛头指向光荣的中国人民解放军，我们坚决不答应！
      （八）加强无产阶级专政。全市各厂矿企业的革命职工，必须提高警惕，按照中共中央、国务院《关于在无产阶级文化大革命中加强公安工作的若干规定》，加强安全保卫工作。混进工厂的地、富、反、坏、右分子，绝对不许乱说乱动。凡破坏无产阶级文化大革命和破坏生产者，必须依法惩处。
    把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动
          提高到新的阶段
    用毛泽东思想挂帅，实现人的思想革命化，是搞好无产阶级文化大革命的根本保证，是搞好生产的根本保证，是办好企业和一切事业的根本保证。要用毛泽东思想去统帅生产和统帅一切工作。无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，全市革命职工活学活用毛主席著作大大加强了，取得了显著的成效。但是，我们不可有丝毫的自满。认为工人阶级可以自发地掌握毛泽东思想，因而降低学习的要求，这种看法是十分错误的。林彪同志说：“毛泽东思想，反映了国内国际阶级斗争的客观规律，反映了无产阶级、劳动人民的根本利益。毛泽东思想并不是劳动人民自发地产生的，而是毛主席在伟大的革命实践基础上天才地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义的思想，是综合了国际共产主义运动的新经验，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。”
  “因此，必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”我们要以千百倍的热情，在职工中积极开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，并且要把它提高到新的阶段。应该学出新的水平。全市厂矿企业的革命职工和革命干部要把“老三篇”当作座右铭，要带着问题反复学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》和《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》等光辉著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，搞好思想革命化。《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》是毛主席的最新最高指示，每个革命职工和革命干部一定要把这一文件的精神落实到实际行动中去。经过文化大革命，我们要把厂矿企业变成毛泽东思想的大学校。我们要让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍北京的每一个工厂，每一个矿山，每一个企业，插遍北京的每一寸土地。
    北京市革命职工代表会议相信，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，全市的革命职工一定能够完成自己的光荣任务，一定能够夺取革命和生产的双胜利！
