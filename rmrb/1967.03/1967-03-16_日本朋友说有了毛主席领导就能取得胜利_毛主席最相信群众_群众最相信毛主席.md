The great leader Chairman Mao personally leads the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, opening a new epoch in world history! "Mao Zedong Thought belongs to the revolutionary people of the whole world. Mao Zedong Thought will definitely guide the Japanese people to final victory!" Japanese friends from the trade sector, Hao Yuan Ding Si and Mu Cun Yi San, recently shared their impressions of visiting China with a reporter from our news agency, expressing their admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and their reverence for Mao Zedong Thought.

Mu Cun Yi San said in his conversation, "We have come to China, which is undergoing a great historical transformation, and we are greatly inspired and educated. We see that 700 million Chinese people are striving to master the great Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, and the masses believe in Chairman Mao the most; the masses have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, and Mao Zedong Thought has grasped the masses. This is a miracle of the world."

Hao Yuan Ding Si said, "China can have 700 million people participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution because it has the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a solid proletarian dictatorship, and the People's Liberation Army founded by Chairman Mao. Ultimately, it is because of the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's leadership is victory."

Hao Yuan Ding Si and Mu Cun Yi San spoke about the vibrant revolutionary scene in China, saying, "The Cultural Revolution has brought about a new leap-forward situation in China. We believe that China will achieve a historic leap. China's great changes will have a significant impact on the world revolution and will definitely have a tremendous impact on the Japanese revolution."

Hao Yuan Ding Si and Mu Cun Yi San spoke about the struggle of the Japanese people, saying, "Chairman Mao said, 'Except for the pro-American monopolistic capitalists and militaristic warlords in Japan, the broad masses of the people are our true friends.' This is an absolutely correct statement. From what we see in Japan, Chairman Mao's judgment is great and correct. The broad masses of the Japanese people resolutely oppose American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, demanding independence and freedom. Mao Zedong Thought will definitely guide the Japanese people to final victory."

Hao Yuan Ding Si and Mu Cun Yi San said, "Mao Zedong Thought belongs to the revolutionary people of the whole world. The Japanese people love Chairman Mao's works and eagerly read them. Chairman Mao's works are our guide to action. Mu Cun Yi San said, "History has proven and will continue to prove that Mao Zedong Thought is a great truth. Mao Zedong Thought will shine even more brilliantly in human history."

    日本朋友说有了毛主席领导就能取得胜利  
    毛主席最相信群众　群众最相信毛主席
    新华社十三日讯　“伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，为世界历史开辟了新纪元！”“毛泽东思想是属于全世界革命人民的，毛泽东思想一定会指导日本人民取得最后的胜利！”日本贸易界朋友萩原定司、木村一三最近在北京向本社记者畅谈访华观感时，就用这样热情的语言，表达了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的爱戴和对毛泽东思想的敬仰。
    木村一三在谈话中说，我们来到正经历着伟大历史变革的中国，受到极大鼓舞和教育。我们看到七亿中国人民正在努力掌握伟大的毛泽东思想。毛主席最相信群众，群众最相信毛主席；群众掌握了毛泽东思想，毛泽东思想掌握了群众。这是世界的奇迹。
    萩原定司说，中国能够有七亿人民参加无产阶级文化大革命，是因为有伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有巩固的无产阶级专政，有毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军。归根结底，是因为有伟大领袖毛主席的领导，毛主席的领导就是胜利。
    萩原定司和木村一三谈到中国朝气蓬勃的革命景象时说，文化大革命使中国出现了新的跃进形势，我们相信，中国将出现一个历史的飞跃。中国的巨变要给世界革命带来很大影响，也一定会对日本革命产生巨大影响。
    萩原定司和木村一三在谈到日本人民的斗争时说，毛主席说，“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”这是千真万确的道理。我们从日本的实际看，毛主席的论断是伟大的、正确的。广大日本人民坚决反对美帝国主义和日本反动派，要求独立、自由。毛泽东思想一定会指导日本人民取得最后的胜利。
    萩原定司和木村一三说，毛泽东思想是属于全世界革命人民的。日本人民热爱毛主席著作，争相阅读毛主席著作。毛主席著作是我们行动的指南。木村一三说，历史已经证明并将继续证明毛泽东思想是伟大的真理，毛泽东思想必将在人类历史上发出更加灿烂的光辉。
