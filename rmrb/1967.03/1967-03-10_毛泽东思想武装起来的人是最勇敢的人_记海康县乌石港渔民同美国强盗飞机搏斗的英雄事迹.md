The sun rises in the east, and the sky is ablaze with red. The red flags flutter, and the land shines brightly. The glorious Mao Zedong Thought nurtures the growth of heroes.

In one of the world's most famous fishing grounds, the North Bay, the blue sea is dotted with flying fish leaping with the waves, and countless seabirds follow closely behind the ships, presenting a beautiful scene. Fleets of fishing boats flying the flag of the People's Republic of China are engaged in production labor. It is here that the imperialist bandit planes and warships of the United States brazenly disrupt the peaceful labor of our fishermen, carrying out wanton bombing and strafing of our fishing boats, committing heinous crimes.

Heroes Despise the Paper Tiger

On November 30, 1966, at 14:45, the wicked American air pirates suddenly swooped down on the high seas of the North Bay, attacking our fishing boats in the operational area. Bombs and shells rained down on our fishing boat No. 7.

In this critical moment, Communist Party member and fisherman Wang Caijie stood tall and firm, gripping the steering wheel tightly, glaring at the air pirates, cursing in his heart: "Shameful! Your bombs can only scare the cowards of revisionism, but they will never scare the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought!" He resolutely and calmly shouted to the fishermen: "Follow Chairman Mao's words, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. We are not afraid of them! We must overcome them!"

Following this, the entire crew of the fishing boat shouted in unison, their voices echoing across the sea and sky:

"Determine to struggle, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

This voice full of confidence in victory showed the heroic character of the Chinese people in despising all reactionaries and their unyielding will to overcome all enemies.

Suddenly, the machine gun of the American pirate plane hit the bridge of the fishing boat, breaking the fishing flag behind Wang Caijie and causing the deck to smoke. However, he still stood firmly on the bridge, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, using rapid and accurate bell sounds to command the fishing boat, navigating through the dense rain of bullets, continuing to sail forward.

The American air pirates, facing our heroic fishermen, were at a loss, like headless flies, dragging their lifeless bodies back to their lair.

Fishermen with experience in fighting the enemy knew that the cunning and ruthless enemy would not give up easily; they would still come to disrupt and sabotage.

On December 1, at 17:00, when our fishing boats No. 9 and No. 10 were returning from the high seas of the North Bay, two American military planes came to harass and attack again.

At this moment, Communist Party member and fisherman Zhang Yacun stood tall on the bridge of fishing boat No. 10, cleverly and bravely tracking the direction of the enemy planes, continuously issuing bell sounds to command the fishing boat, repeatedly evading the bombing and strafing of the enemy planes.

"Serve the people wholeheartedly," Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings echoed in the ears of Communist Party member and fisherman Zhang Minglu. Seeing Zhang Yacun steering on the deck in danger, he quickly went over to replace Zhang Yacun at the helm, urging him to go below deck to avoid the bullets. Zhang Yacun tightly gripped the steering wheel, refusing to let go, saying: "You go below deck to avoid the bullets. As long as I resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, the bombs of the American devils will have to obey my commands."

Zhang Yacun and Zhang Minglu argued, so they both steered the boat together. The mechanic, fisherman Ye Qingzhi, remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Strategically, we must despise the enemy; tactically, we must take the enemy seriously," and focused his energy on accurately controlling the speed regulator. The few of them worked together, bravely and cleverly, fighting against the enemy planes, repeatedly avoiding the enemy's firepower, causing the bombs dropped by the enemy to fall into the sea beside the boat.

The American pirates used all their tricks but could not hit the fishing boat, only emitting a buzzing wail. The fishermen saw this and remembered the brilliant verses of Chairman Mao: "In this small globe, a few flies bump into the wall. Buzzing, a few shrill cries, a few sobs." The fishermen thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, saw the true form of American imperialism's paper tiger, and from the bottom of their hearts established an unshakable belief in victory.

Suddenly, a loud bang, the mast of fishing boat No. 10 was blown off halfway. Following this, an American-made rocket penetrated the bottom of three compartments of the fishing boat, seawater rushed into the compartment, and smoke billowed up on the boat.

At this critical moment, the entire crew of the fishing boat erupted with a voice that shook the heavens:

"Determine to struggle, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

The boat continued to roar with the sound of the engine, cutting through the waves, advancing bravely!

In the compartment, there hung a portrait of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Zhang Yacun, disregarding the smoke and fire, the suffocation, and the burns on his hands, rushed into the compartment, determined to take out the portrait of Chairman Mao!

Head can be cut off, blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned. This is the oath and resolve of every fisherman fighting on the sea.

"Comrades, the time to test us has come. As long as we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the enemy's bombs cannot defeat us, and the fire cannot burn us. We must definitely extinguish the fire and take out the portrait of Chairman Mao!"

The young apprentice mechanic, Mai Ya'er, Guo Qixiang, and Ye Qingzhi also rushed into the smoke-filled compartment, working together with Zhang Yacun to extinguish the fire in the compartment. When Zhang Yacun rushed out of the compartment, the red and shining portrait of Chairman Mao in his hands was like a radiant sun, illuminating the surging North Bay and lighting up the entire world.

Fighting Against the Waves to Save Comrades

The wind howled, and the waves surged. The vicious American air pirates continued to bomb and strafe our fishing fleet. A fishing boat from the Qingshui Fishery Port of Haikang County was hit by a bomb from an American pirate plane, resulting in the deaths of three fishermen, with the remaining nine fighting against the enemy planes and the waves.

The fishermen on the fishing boat No. 13 of Haikang County discovered that their brother ship was in distress and immediately reported to the captain Zhang Zhenyun. Zhang Zhenyun alertly steadied the steering wheel and shouted, "Turn the boat to rescue people!" and led everyone to recite Chairman Mao's teachings: "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other."

The great Mao Zedong Thought gave everyone the boundless strength to overcome difficulties and rescue their class brothers.

At this moment, the sea was blowing a level-six wind, and the waves were like small mountains, crashing against the side of the boat and hitting the bow.

The surging waves could not stop the brave and fearless heroes, and the terrifying waves could not deter the heroic hearts of those who save others at the risk of their own lives. The great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "We die for the people, and it is a worthy death," echoed in the ears of the fishermen fighting against the enemy planes and the surging waves.

Mai Xiangwei thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and felt his blood boiling, his body full of strength. He immediately requested of the captain Zhang Zhenyun:

"Captain, let me go. Let me go alone in the boat!"

"No, more people should go!" Everyone volunteered to go to sea to rescue their class brothers.

"One person going makes a smaller target. The enemy planes are still strafing, and it's dangerous for everyone to go." At this moment, Mai Xiangwei's only thought was: "Reduce unnecessary sacrifices as much as possible."

With the captain's approval, Mai Xiangwei, with a heart full of love for his class brothers, alone rowed the small boat, facing the wind and waves, set off.

The small boat was sometimes rolled into the trough of the waves, sometimes pushed onto the crest of the waves...

Just as the nine class brothers were about to sink, Mai Xiangwei finally maneuvered the small boat close to the sinking fishing boat. Eight class brothers were saved. At the same moment, the fishing boat No. 13 also rescued another fisherman brother. The blood bond of class brothers warmed the hearts of the fishermen, and when they looked up at the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao on the boat, they could not contain their excitement, shouting in unison:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!!!"

Now, the fishermen of Haikang County resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and in the struggle to grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production and fight against the enemy, striving for greater victories.

    毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最勇敢的人
    ——记海康县乌石港渔民同美国强盗飞机搏斗的英雄事迹
    旭日东升，霞光万丈，红旗漫卷，大地闪光。光辉的毛泽东思想，哺育着英雄的成长。
    在世界著名渔场之一的北部湾，碧蓝的海面上成群的飞鱼在随波飞跃，无数的海鸟紧紧随着船尾飞翔，呈现着一派美丽的景色。一队队悬挂着中华人民共和国国旗的捕鱼船队，进行生产劳动。就在这里，美帝国主义的强盗飞机、军舰肆意破坏我渔民的和平劳动，猖狂地轰炸扫射我渔船，犯下了滔天罪行。
    英雄藐视纸老虎
    一九六六年十一月三十日十四时四十五分，万恶的美国空中强盗，在北部湾公海上，突然窜入我渔船作业区上空，向我国渔船发动了疯狂的袭击。炮弹、炸弹不断地向我机帆七号渔船打来。
    在危急时刻，共产党员、渔民王才杰昂首挺胸，紧把船舵，怒视着空中飞贼，心里骂道：“可耻！你纸老虎的炸弹只能吓破修正主义者的胆，但永远吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民！”
    他坚定、沉着地向渔民们喊着：“听毛主席的话，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。我们不怕它！我们要压倒它！”
    接着，全船渔民一起喊着响彻海空的声音：
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    这充满胜利信心的声音，显示了中国人民藐视一切反动派的英雄性格，显示了他们压倒一切敌人的坚强信念。
    突然，美国强盗飞机的机关炮击中了渔船的驾驶台，打断了插在王才杰身后的捕鱼旗号，船板被打得直冒烟火。但是，他仍然坚定地屹立在驾驶台上，双手紧紧地握着船舵，用急促而又准确的钟声，指挥渔船，穿过密集的弹雨，继续航行。
    美国空中强盗在我英雄渔民的面前，无可奈何，象一只只无头苍蝇，拖着僵尸般的机体溜回它的老巢。
    有着对敌斗争经验的渔民们知道，凶残狡猾的敌人，决不会就此甘心，它们还是要来破坏捣乱的。
    十二月一日十七时，当我机帆九号、十号渔船在北部湾公海返航的时候，美国军用飞机两架又追来骚扰袭击。
    这时候，巍然站在机帆十号渔船驾驶台上的共产党员、渔民张亚村，机智勇敢，怒目跟踪着敌机的方向，不断发出航行快慢的钟声，指挥着渔船，一次又一次地摆脱敌机的轰炸扫射。
    “毫不利己专门利人”，毛主席的亲切教导，回旋在共产党员、渔民张明禄的耳畔，他看到张亚村在船面掌舵有危险，便急忙过去接替张亚村掌舵，要他下舱避弹。张亚村紧紧抓住船舵不放说：“你下去避弹。只要我坚决听毛主席的话，美国鬼子的炸弹就得听我摆布。”
    张亚村、张明禄两人争执不下，就一起掌着舵。轮机长、渔民叶庆志牢记着毛主席在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人的教导，也集中精力，准确地控制调速器。他们几个人同心协力，勇敢机智，同敌机展开斗争，一次又一次地避开敌机火力，使敌机投下的炸弹落在船边的大海里。
    美国飞贼使尽了诡计也炸不着渔船，只是发出嗡嗡惨叫。渔民们看到这种情况，想起了毛主席的光辉诗篇中“小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣”的诗句。渔民们想想毛主席的教导，看看美帝国主义纸老虎的原形毕露，从心底里树立了坚强的必胜信念。
    烈火熊熊心更红
    突然，“噼啪”一声，十号渔船粗大的桅杆被敌机炸断了半截。接着，一枚美制火箭弹头穿透了渔船的三个舱底，海水涌进船舱，船上腾起了浓烟。
    在这紧急时刻，全船渔民迸发出响彻云霄的声音：
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    船，仍然响着隆隆的马达声，迎风劈浪，勇往直前！
    在船舱里挂着一张我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的画像。张亚村不顾烟熏火燎，不顾窒息难忍，不顾手上的烧伤，向船舱里冲去，决心把毛主席像取出来！
    头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。这是战斗在海上的每个渔民的誓言和决心。
      “同志们，考验我们的时候到了。只要有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，敌人的炸弹是炸不倒我们的，烈火也是烧不倒我们的。我们一定要把大火扑灭，把毛主席像取出来！”
    少年实习轮机员麦亚二和郭其香、叶庆志也冲进烟火弥漫的船舱，同张亚村一起，奋力扑灭了船舱里的烈火。当张亚村从船舱里冲出来时，他手中捧着的红光闪闪的毛主席像，就象一轮光芒万丈的旭日，照耀着波涛汹涌的北部湾，照亮着整个世界。
    战胜骇浪救亲人
    海风呼啸，波涛汹涌。穷凶极恶的美国空中强盗，还在连续疯狂地轰炸、扫射我捕鱼船队。海康县企水渔港的一艘渔船被美国强盗飞机的炸弹击中了，三个渔民牺牲，其余九个人正在与敌机和海浪搏斗。
    风帆十三号渔船上的渔民麦祥伟发现兄弟船遇难，马上报告船长张振云。张振云机警地把稳船舵高喊：“转船救人！”并带领大家一起背诵毛主席的教导：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    伟大的毛泽东思想，给了大家战胜困难，抢救阶级兄弟的无穷力量。
    这时候，海上正刮着六级大风，海浪象一座座小山，冲击着船边，顶着船头。
    惊涛挡不住英勇无畏的勇士，骇浪吓不退舍己救人的雄心。伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所”，回响在同敌机、同惊涛骇浪搏斗的渔民的耳边。
    麦祥伟想起毛主席的这些教导就热血沸腾，浑身是劲。他立刻向船长张振云请求：
    “船长，派我去吧。由我一个人摇船去！”
    “不，应该多几个人去！”大家都争着下海抢救阶级兄弟。
    “一个人去目标小。敌机还在扫射，大家都去有危险。”这时候，麦祥伟唯一的念头是：“尽量减少不必要的牺牲。”
    在船长同意下，麦祥伟怀着一颗抢救阶级兄弟的红心，独自摇着小船，顶着风浪出发了。
    小船时而被卷进浪谷，时而被推上波峰……。
    就在九个阶级兄弟快要沉没的危险时刻，麦祥伟终于把小船靠近将要沉没的渔船。有八个阶级兄弟得救了。同一个时刻，风帆十三号渔船也救起了另一个渔民兄弟。阶级兄弟的血肉情谊，象一股暖流温暖着渔民的心，当他们仰望着挂在船上的伟大领袖毛主席像时，都抑制不住内心的激动，同声高呼：
    “毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！”
    现在，海康县渔民们，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在狠抓革命、猛促生产和对敌斗争中，争取更大的胜利。
