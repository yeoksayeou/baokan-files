The Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" has strongly condemned the support and instigation provided by U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership to the Indonesian reactionaries, who are serving the counter-revolutionary global strategy of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary states that currently, U.S. imperialism is directing its counter-revolutionary global strategy towards Asia, striving to forge new anti-communist alliances and tightening the "noose" around China. The military dictatorship and bloodthirsty regime in Jakarta play a crucial role in this aggressive plan.

The commentary reveals that while U.S. imperialism is actively supporting the Indonesian reactionaries, the Khrushchev revisionists are further expanding their cooperation and friendship with the Jakarta reactionary clique, providing them with greater support. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, based on the policy of Soviet-American cooperation and the hegemony of the two superpowers, is making every effort to provide the Indonesian right-wing military clique with economic, political, and military aid. This aims to consolidate the fascist rule of this reactionary group, further enabling it to oppose the People's Republic of China and all peoples who do not submit to the will of imperialism and revisionism. The cooperation between the Khrushchev revisionists and the Indonesian fascist regime clearly shows that they are friends and accomplices of the executioners who massacred Indonesian communists and patriots.

New China News Agency, March 30: Jakarta reports that the right-wing military regime of Indonesia, a lackey of U.S. imperialism, is actively planning to form a "regional cooperation" organization among Southeast Asian countries to serve its American masters' scheme of forming an anti-China encirclement.

According to a report by the Antara News Agency on March 28, Indonesian right-wing military regime Foreign Minister Malik stated on March 26 that Indonesia is "currently exploring the possibility of regional cooperation in economic, cultural, and technological fields in Southeast Asia." When asked about the nature of this organization, Malik disclosed its military nature, saying: "The implications of defensive arrangements are very broad and extensive, so cooperation in economic, cultural, and technological fields can also be said to include defense."

The Associated Press also reported from Jakarta on March 26, quoting an Indonesian Foreign Ministry official, that "Indonesia hopes to establish a regional organization larger than the current Southeast Asian alliance composed of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand."

The vice-chairman of the "Cooperative Parliament" controlled by the Indonesian right-wing, Hussein Kattasasmitta, stated on March 29 that he supports Malik's initiative to form a regional cooperation organization. "He further confirmed that cooperation in economic, technological, and cultural fields, in a broad sense, can also include defense cooperation."

Previously, some Indonesian right-wing military and political figures had openly advocated for the formation of a "Southeast Asian Joint Defense Organization" to counter the so-called "threat from China." Indonesian Sumatran Military Region Commander Mokojinta, during a recent visit to "Malaysia," publicly proposed the establishment of a military alliance between Indonesia, "Malaysia," and other Southeast Asian countries.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》指出
    美帝苏修大力豢养印尼反动派
    印尼右派政权积极拼凑军事联盟为美帝反华阴谋效劳
    据新华社地拉那三十日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十九日发表评论，强烈谴责美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团支持和唆使印度尼西亚反动派，为美帝国主义的反革命全球战略效劳。
    评论说，目前，美帝国主义把它的反革命全球战略的矛头指向亚洲，竭力在亚洲拼凑新的反共同盟，拉紧“火力网”包围中国。雅加达的军事独裁和嗜血成性的政权，在这一侵略计划中担负着重要的角色。
    评论揭露说，在美帝国主义积极扶植印尼反动派的同时，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也在更加扩大同雅加达反动集团的合作与友好，给它以更大的支持。勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团基于苏美合作和两大国的霸权政策，正在千方百计地给印尼右派将领集团以经济、政治和军事上的援助，以便巩固这个反动集团的法西斯统治，从而使它进一步反对中华人民共和国和一切不愿屈从于帝国主义和修正主义者意旨的人民。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者与印尼法西斯政权的合作最清楚地表明，他们是屠杀印尼共产党人和爱国志士的刽子手的朋友和同伙。
    新华社三十日讯　雅加达消息：美帝国主义的走狗印度尼西亚右派军人政权，正积极策划组成东南亚国家“地区性合作”组织，为它的美国主子的拼凑反华包围圈的阴谋计划效劳。
    据安塔拉通讯社二十八日报道，印尼右派军人政权的外交部长马利克二十六日说，印尼“现在正在探索在东南亚实现经济、文化和技术上的地区性合作的可能性”。在回答关于这个组织的性质的问题时，马利克透露了这个组织的军事性质，他说：“防御安排的含义包括的范围和方面很广，因此在经济、文化和技术方面的合作也可以说包括防御。”
    美联社在二十六日也从雅加达引用印尼外交部人士的谈话报道，“印尼希望成立一个比现在由菲律宾、马来西亚和泰国组成的东南亚联盟更大的区域性组织”。
    印尼右派控制的“合作国会”的政府、对外关系、国防和安全委员会副主席侯赛因·卡塔萨斯米塔在二十九日发表谈话，表示支持马利克的关于组成地区性合作组织的倡议，“他还进一步证实在经济、技术和文化方面的合作在广义上说也可以包括防御合作的”。
    在此以前，印尼的一些右派军人和政客就曾经露骨地叫嚷要拼凑“东南亚共同防御组织”来对付所谓“来自中国的威胁”。印尼苏门答腊军区司令莫科京塔在不久前访问“马来西亚”时，就公开提出印尼、“马来西亚”同其他的东南亚国家建立军事联盟。
