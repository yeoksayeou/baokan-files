	Iron hammers rise and fall with the roar of thunder,
	Opening mountains and splitting rocks with great skill,
	Building canals and dams to change nature,
	Stream after stream of clear water flows...
	Thousands of soldiers and horses bustle with spring plowing,
	Labor songs echo off the cliffs,
	"Seize the day" and learn from Dazhai,
	Realize the gardenification of agriculture.
	Chairman Mao's teachings are always in mind,
	Revolution and production are both grasped,
	Turn barren mountains into fertile fields,
	See the mountain village beautiful as a painting.

	Team Leader Old Ma, Team Leader Old Ma—
	With a thick waist and strong arms,
	Revolutionary, daring to fight and charge ahead,
	Who doesn't praise his work!
	Yesterday at the party meeting, he made a self-criticism,
	He corrects mistakes with great determination;
	Today, he is still leading the charge,
	His enthusiasm for spring plowing is fiery.
	Listen! Old Ma's voice echoes off the cliffs:
	"Following Chairman Mao to make revolution—
	One must endure 'knocking'!"
	Look! How strong Old Ma is:
	His iron arms dance, the silver hoe falls,
	Plowing the clouds and sowing the rain...
	Team Leader, Old Ma,
	A red sun hangs in your heart,
	Grasp the revolution and promote production,
	Both fronts bloom with red flowers!

    山村新貌
    （外一首）
    刘赞兵　王代陈铁锤起落风雷吼，开山劈石本领大，修渠垒堰改自然，条条清泉水哗哗……千军万马闹春耕，劳动号子震山崖， “只争朝夕”学大寨，实现农业园田化。毛主席教导记心上，革命生产一手抓，定叫荒山变良田，喜看山村美如画。队长老马队长老马——腰粗膀大，干革命敢打敢冲，干活儿谁个不夸！昨天支部会上作检查，他有错误就改决心大；今儿个照样跨马上阵，闹春耕的干劲火辣辣。听！老马的声音震山崖：“跟着毛主席干革命嘛——就要经得住‘敲打’！”看！老马的劲儿有多大：铁臂飞舞银锄落，耕云播雨把种撒……队长啊！老马，一轮红日心头挂，狠抓革命促生产，两条战线开红花！
