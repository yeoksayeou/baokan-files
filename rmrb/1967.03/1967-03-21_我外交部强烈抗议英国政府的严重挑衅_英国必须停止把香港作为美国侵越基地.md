	China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protests Britain's serious provocation
	Britain must stop using Hong Kong as a base for U.S. aggression in Vietnam

	Xinhua News Agency, March 20th - Today, the responsible official of the European Affairs Department of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Hopkinson, and handed over a note from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British Chargé d'Affaires in China. The note strongly protests the British government's continued indulgence of U.S. aggression forces using Hong Kong as a base for U.S. aggression in the Vietnam War.

	The note first pointed out that since this year, U.S. warships directly participating in the aggression against Vietnam have entered Hong Kong more than seventy or eighty times with the British government's indulgence. Among them are the aircraft carriers "Rosevelt," "Bennington," and "Ticonderoga," the amphibious assault ship "Lewin Island," the cruiser "Long Beach," and the flagship of the Seventh Fleet, "Providence." On March 14th, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" also entered Hong Kong. These U.S. warships have conducted a series of war preparations in Hong Kong.

	The note further pointed out that the U.S. is currently frantically expanding its aggression in Vietnam. The U.S. aggressors have brutally massacred the Vietnamese people and even sunk Chinese fishing boats, owing a heavy blood debt to the Chinese people. The British government shamelessly indulges U.S. warships entering and leaving Hong Kong to conduct various war preparations, which is a serious provocation to the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of Southeast Asia. The Chinese government strongly protests this to the British government.

	The note also pointed out that the Chinese government, in notes on September 1, 1965, and February 1, 1966, had strongly protested to the British government for providing Hong Kong to the U.S. as a base for aggression in Vietnam. However, the British government not only did not stop the U.S. from using Hong Kong for various war preparations but also became more brazen in acting as an accomplice to the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. It should be pointed out that the more the U.S. expands its aggression, the more it will fail miserably. The British government, ignoring the repeated protests of the Chinese government, insists on following the U.S. policy of aggression, which will ultimately only seriously harm its own interests. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has long said: "Chamberlain started with the intention of harming others and ended with harming himself. This will be the development law of all reactionary policies."

	The note finally pointed out that the Chinese government must warn the British government: You must stop providing Hong Kong to the U.S. as a base for aggression in Vietnam; otherwise, you will have to bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

### 我外交部强烈抗议英国政府的严重挑衅  英国必须停止把香港作为美国侵越基地

    我外交部强烈抗议英国政府的严重挑衅
    英国必须停止把香港作为美国侵越基地
    新华社二十日讯　我国外交部西欧司负责人今天召见英国驻华代办霍普森，递交我国外交部给英国驻华代办处的一项照会，就英国政府继续纵容美国侵略军利用香港作为美国侵略越南战争的活动基地一事，向英国政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会首先指出，今年以来，直接参加侵略越南战争的美国舰只在英国政府纵容下开到香港已有七、八十艘次。其中，包括航空母舰“罗斯福号”、“本宁吞号”、“奇地霍克号”，两栖攻击舰“琉璜岛号”，巡洋舰“长滩号”和第七舰队旗舰“普罗维登斯号”。三月十四日，美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”又开进香港。这些美国舰只在香港进行了一系列的战备活动。
    照会接着指出，目前美国正在疯狂扩大侵略越南战争。美国侵略者血腥残杀了越南人民，并且炸沉过中国的渔船，对中国人民欠下了累累血债。英国政府竟然肆无忌惮地纵容美国侵略舰只进出香港进行各种战备活动，这是对中国人民、越南人民和东南亚人民的严重挑衅。对此，中国政府向英国政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会还指出，中国政府在一九六五年九月一日和一九六六年二月一日两次照会中，曾就英国政府把香港提供给美国作为侵略越南战争的活动基地一事，向英国政府提出强烈抗议。但是，英国政府非但没有停止让美国利用香港进行各种战备活动，反而变本加厉地充当美国侵略越南战争的帮凶。应当指出，美国越是扩大侵略战争，它的失败也就会越惨。英国政府这样不顾中国政府的一再抗议，硬要死心塌地追随美国的侵略战争政策，到头来是只会严重损害自己的利益的。中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席早就说过：“张伯伦以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终。这将是一切反动政策的发展规律。”
    照会最后指出，中国政府不能不正告英国政府：你们必须停止继续把香港提供给美国作为侵略越南战争的活动基地，否则必将承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
