First, one must have the correct attitude. After studying "Where is Our Lu Xun Corps Going?", we have gained much enlightenment. One important point is that only by establishing the correct attitude towards rectification can we successfully carry out the rectification movement.

Among our comrades, there are many incorrect views regarding rectification. Some are dominated by the fear of rectification causing the leftist forces to collapse and conservative forces to rise, thus they dare not expose their shortcomings and errors, but instead try to cover them up. Others are burdened by the idea that the "general direction is always correct," constantly remembering past achievements, unwilling to engage in self-criticism, and unable to accept criticism from others. All these issues stem from the "self" and will hinder the healthy development of the rectification movement.

The comrades of the Lu Xun Corps have set a good example for us. During rectification, they do not hide their problems but openly engage in self-criticism, exposing their ideological issues, and sincerely welcome criticism from the masses. They do not become complacent with their achievements but use Mao Zedong Thought as a microscope to deeply examine and criticize various non-proletarian thoughts within their ranks, thus maintaining a vigorous revolutionary spirit. They have done so well!

Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force for revolution, and at the same time, we must continually regard ourselves as the object of revolution. Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, this revolution will not succeed."

We must act according to Comrade Lin Biao's words, learn from the experiences of the Shanghai comrades, and during rectification, thoroughly revolutionize ourselves, break away from "self," and establish "public spirit," making the Jinggangshan Corps even stronger and more robust, forever advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    首先要有正确的态度
    学习了《我们鲁迅兵团向何处去？》，受到很多启发。重要的一条，是只有树立起正确的整风态度，才能搞好整风运动。
    在我们的同志中间，存在着不少对整风的不正确看法。有的是“怕”字当头，怕整风把左派队伍整垮，保守势力趁机抬头，因此不敢把缺点错误亮出来，而是企图把它包起来。有的是背上了“大方向始终正确”的包袱，念念不忘过去的成绩，不肯作自我批评，也听不得别人的批评。凡此种种，都是“私”字在作怪，都会妨碍整风运动的健康开展。
    鲁迅兵团的战友们给我们做出了好榜样。他们在整风中，不是遮遮掩掩，而是公开地进行自我批评，把自己的思想问题亮出来，并且真诚地欢迎群众的批评。他们在成绩面前不自满，而是用毛泽东思想作显微镜，深刻地检查批判自己队伍里的各种非无产阶级思想，使他们保持了旺盛的革命朝气。他们做得多么好啊！
    林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”
    我们一定要按照林彪同志所说的去做，学习上海战友们的经验，在整风中大革自己的命，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，使井冈山兵团更加坚强壮大，永远沿着毛主席的革命路线前进！
