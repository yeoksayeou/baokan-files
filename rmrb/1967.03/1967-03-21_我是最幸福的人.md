Early in the morning, the doors of the foreign language bookstore in Hanoi had not yet opened, but a long line of people waiting to buy the precious book had already formed. Some workers who had just finished their night shift did not go home but instead went to the bookstore to buy books. In a store on Quan Su Street, nearly a thousand copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" were sold in just two hours.

A worker who had just traveled several hundred kilometers by train from his hometown to Hanoi heard that the foreign language bookstore was selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." He hurried to the bookstore and bought six copies. He joyfully told the people around him: "Now, I am the happiest person. When I return to my hometown, I will give these most precious gifts to my relatives and friends so that they can read them, arm their minds, promote production, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors."

    我是最幸福的人
    一清早，河内的外文书店的门还没有开，门口已经长长地排起了等买宝书的人。一些刚做完夜班的工人，不回家就相约到书店买书。在钱场街一个门市部里，仅仅两个钟头内就出售了近千册《毛主席语录》。
    一个刚从老街乘几百公里火车来到河内的工人，一下车听说外文书店出售《毛主席语录》，便急急忙忙赶到书店去买了六本《毛主席语录》。他高兴地向周围的人说：现在，我是最幸福的人了。回到老街后，我要把这些最珍贵的礼物送给亲友，好让他们读了以后，武装头脑，促进生产，彻底战胜美国侵略强盗。
