Title: "Striking Down a Large Group, Protecting a Few" is a Component of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line

Edition: 1

The original leadership of Tsinghua University consisted of eleven cadres (one Party Secretary and University President, five Deputy Secretaries, and five Deputy Presidents), 145 cadres at the level of Deputy Department Head, Deputy Party Branch Secretary, Deputy Section Chief, and Deputy Department Head, and over 400 cadres at the level of Party Branch Deputy Secretary and Deputy Group Leader. In total, there were over 500 cadres.

Since June 9, 1966, when the work team entered the university and announced the "seizure of power," assuming the duties of the Party Committee, all original cadres at the school, department, and research group levels were "sidelined." Political instructors and Party Branch Secretaries (even Branch Committee members) in student classes were no exception.

The work team's handling of cadres after entering the university can be roughly divided into three stages:

The first stage: From June 9, when the work team entered the university, to June 23. The work team removed all cadres from their posts, sidelined them all, and sent them "upstairs." Then, they conducted a thorough examination of everyone. They implemented the policy of "striking down a large group, protecting a few."

The second stage: From June 24 to July 15. The work team conducted a so-called "anti-Qiao" campaign. At the same time, the "anti-Qiao" campaign and cadre examinations were conducted simultaneously, using cadres to attack revolutionary leftists, allowing cadres to "redeem themselves."

The third stage: From July 16 to early August, when the work team withdrew. The work team conducted a so-called "criticism" and "struggle" against the "black gang." Cadres continued to be examined and "sent downstairs," with some cadres being "hung up."

The specific methods of the work team were as follows:

(1) Not conducting class analysis of cadres, generally rejecting and overthrowing them

After the work team entered the university, on the morning of June 11, Deputy Team Leader Yang XX convened a full cadre meeting, announcing that the work team had come to Tsinghua to "seize power" and demanding that the attending cadres "honestly confess."

They also spread among the students: "Jiang XX is bad, so from the Party Committee and Youth League Committee to the department Party Branch and sub-branch, all are bad, and there are no good cadres at all," "Tsinghua is a den of thieves," "the entire Party organization of Tsinghua is a large royalist party." They even said: "Tsinghua Party is a black party," "Tsinghua cadres are a solid block," "Tsinghua cadres can't be reformed in eight years."

The work team did not allow cadres to read big-character posters, participate in the movement, or any meetings, completely isolating them from the masses and making them read "Cultivation" all day. The work team demanded that cadres read the book "Cultivation" more, write self-examinations to "come downstairs," saying, "Your past mistakes were because you didn't read this book enough."

The department Party Branch Secretaries and Branch Secretaries were all taken over or appointed by the work team, with many of them being the "leftists" in the work team's eyes.

On July 12, the Mechanical Department's temporary Party Branch was established. At the meeting, the work team first announced and approved the promotion of He XX, Hu XX, and Zhang XX (He and Hu were promoted two months early), then appointed He XX as Deputy Secretary, and Zhang XX, Hu XX, and Zhang XX as Branch Committee members. The announcement was so sudden that even Zhang XX herself was surprised, leading to a joke among the students.

In the Automatic Control Department, the work team hurriedly promoted Liu XX early and appointed her as the Deputy Secretary of the temporary Party Branch, causing much discontent among the students.

(2) Confusing two types of contradictions, "striking down a large group, protecting a few"

For general cadres, they were treated as enemies. In the Mathematics and Physics Department, 55 cadres at the level of Party Branch Committee member and above, and research group leaders, were labeled as "black gang" and "black line" by the work team, accounting for 71% of the total number of cadres. All 12 members of the department Party Branch Committee were labeled as "black gang."

Soon after the work team entered the university, a student posted a big-character poster titled "Ten Orders for Cadres." The work team said this poster "showed long proletarian spirit and extinguished the prestige of the bourgeois royalists" and broadcasted it throughout the university, announcing it in each department and reaching all cadres. The main contents were:

(1) Must thoroughly confess the "black organization";
(2) Must confess the fake uprising and the mastermind behind it;
(3) Before June 14, hand over the "black list" to the work team;
(4) Without the work team's permission, stay in the dormitory, be ready to be summoned, and wait for interrogation;
(5) Absolutely obey the work team's orders;
(6) Do not touch a hair of the work team members.

This way, all cadres were locked in their rooms, writing self-examinations, thought reports, activity reports, and confession materials all day. Going out of the school gate required permission, even student instructors and class leaders were not exempt.

On the other hand, the work team protected a few who truly followed the capitalist road. Jiang XX had not returned to school at the Ministry of Higher Education. Wang XX said to the "Group of Seventeen" in the Chemical Engineering Department on July 23 (the group of seventeen students in the class of 902 who opposed Qiao Dafu): "Jiang XX's nature is not yet determined." Liu XX (Deputy Secretary of the School Party Committee) and Hu XX (Deputy Secretary of the School Party Committee) attended the three-level cadre meeting at the Beijing Hotel from May 25 to June 28. He XX (Deputy Secretary of the School Party Committee) was recuperating in Xishan until July 18 before returning to school. Liu and Hu were only struggled once after returning to school. Ai XX (Deputy Secretary of the School Party Committee) was protected in every way, and only after the masses were indignant did the work team hurriedly struggle against him.

(3) Conducting thorough examinations and "coming downstairs" among grassroots cadres

All cadres were sidelined. The masses described it as: "Parading in the streets in a long line, struggling in a large group, labor reform in a large team." This way, those who followed the capitalist road to power did not feel isolated.

In the grassroots cadres, thorough examinations and "coming downstairs" were conducted. On June 18, someone gave Liu XX instructions: Regarding the issue of Party member cadres "coming downstairs," let each class discuss whether to criticize all Party member cadres and let them write self-examinations. Thus, Ye XX and others reported to the Municipal Committee on June 20, clearly stipulating: For grassroots cadres (instructors, branch secretaries, branch committee members), "generally adopt the method of self-examination and criticism and assistance from the masses." Some class leaders in the Mechanical Department had to write self-examinations four or five times before barely passing, and even some Youth League branch committee members and activists were identified as "coming downstairs" targets by the work team.

The work team's policy towards grassroots cadres, in their words, was:

"Peeling layer by layer" (peeling from the bottom up, first exposing the grassroots, then the Party Committee);
"Sweeping the outskirts first, then attacking the black line";
"Small demons expose big demons" (from bottom to top);
"Following the vine to find the melon, internal investigation and external investigation."

The work team spread among the masses: "Tsinghua's cadres are all 'ox' type" (meaning monsters and demons), the cadres below and above Tsinghua have formed a "deadly alliance," and even said "the ones below are worse than the ones above."

When examining and "coming downstairs," there were several standards:

Examining mistakes and confessing crimes
Raising the level of consciousness and exposing the black heart
The so-called "raising the level of consciousness" was to raise it to "consciously executing Jiang XX's counter-revolutionary revisionist line," "consciously opposing Mao Zedong Thought," "consciously opposing the Party and the Party Central Committee."

Under the guidance of the bourgeois reactionary line, the deputy team leader Yang XX personally arranged for the examination and "coming downstairs" of grassroots cadres: "Pay attention to combining intimidation and psychological warfare, combining intimidation in large meetings and psychological warfare in small meetings." He said: Cadres cannot be "tolerated," and the maximum effort should be made to "not miss a single bad person."

The scope of the examination and "coming downstairs" was almost all Party members. The work team proposed: "Party members who originally blindly executed the instructions of the former Municipal Committee should be examined"; "Party members who originally blindly executed the instructions of the School Party Committee should be examined." For example, in the Mechanical Department, there were 202 Party members, 59 were not allowed to "come downstairs," 115 were examined and "came downstairs," and 28 were "hung up" (according to the numbers announced by the work team on July 12).

This way, the masses said: In Tsinghua, "Party members are not as good as Youth League members, and Youth League members are not as good as the masses."

In the Mathematics and Physics Department, something strange happened: Soon after the work team entered the university, they asked an "old professor" outside the Party, Du XX (an old bourgeois intellectual), to convene the Mathematics and Physics Department's Branch Committee meeting. At that time, Du said at the meeting: The work team told you to honestly confess. The work team also sent a Party member to be Du's secretary to take notes.

(4) Using cadres to attack revolutionary masses

From June 24 to July 15, the work team conducted the so-called "anti-Qiao" struggle, and at this time, they used cadres to direct the spearhead at the revolutionary masses.

The work team used the cadres' eagerness to "come downstairs" and "be liberated" to incite them to "anti-Qiao," saying this was a "great opportunity" for cadres to "touch their souls" and "redeem themselves." Zhang XX was the class teacher of Qiao Dafu, and because of the need for "anti-Qiao," the work team let him "come downstairs" early.

Some cadres examined multiple times, but the work team said it was not enough. However, if they were active in "anti-Qiao," they could quickly "come downstairs." For example, in the Department of Engineering Physics, there was a "thug" who "protected Jiang" in the past, but because of his active "anti-Qiao," he quickly "came downstairs." To "anti-Qiao," Wang XX wanted cadres to "show support for the work team with actual actions," to restore Party and Youth League organizations during the debate with Qiao Dafu, to let Party members express their stance, and "come downstairs." If they did not "anti-Qiao," they would let the cadres "hang" for a long time and could not "come downstairs."

On July 10, Wang XX said: Only criticizing a few typical cases, thereby educating the majority, this is not contradictory, and at the same time, in the struggle, some Party members and cadres were also liberated.

After the work team withdrew, during the period when the "Three Temporaries" (the Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee, the "Red Guards" Temporary Headquarters, and the Temporary Presidium, all led by He XX and Liu XX) took power in Tsinghua, they continued to implement the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue.

(1) Under the pretext of opposing the work team's "rightist deviation" on cadres, they continued to spread the propaganda of "overthrowing everything"

They proposed: "The revisionism of Tsinghua University is a black tree, the trunk is the School Party Committee, and the branches are all the cadres below." Therefore, they should be "completely overthrown," otherwise, they "cannot be uprooted." They posted a couplet at the door of the cafeteria where teachers and cadres eat:

Helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, all are inert gases
A group of bastards
Eating, drinking, playing, sleeping, not caring about national affairs

(2) Organizing so-called "black gang labor reform teams," sweeping the "labor reform wind"

They divided the cadres into three categories:

Black gang members - School-level cadres, Branch Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries;
Black line figures - Branch Committee members, Branch Secretaries;
Black gang henchmen - Branch office staff, activists.

Then they formed three labor reform teams:

First labor reform team (August 2 - early November): Participants were school-level cadres, Branch Secretaries, and department heads;
Second labor reform team (August 2 - early November): Participants were Deputy Branch Secretaries and Sub-Branch Secretaries;
Third labor reform team (late August - late October): Participants were Branch Secretaries and Committee members.

Some political teachers and political instructors were also labor reformed.

In the thirteen units of the school, the proportion of Branch Committee members and above who were labor reformed was 100% in nine units, and over 80% in other units.

In the fourteen units of the Party Committee departments and school offices, the proportion of those who were labor reformed was 100% in nine units.

Out of over 500 cadres in the entire school, 70% were labor reformed, and those who were not labor reformed were mostly old or sick; some grassroots cadres were not labor reformed due to resistance from the masses.

(3) Physical punishment of cadres

On the evening of August 25, some former "Red Guards" of Tsinghua, in the lecture hall, whipped the "labor reform team" cadres with leather whips. Those who were beaten were mostly Deputy Department Heads, Branch Secretaries, and Deputy Secretaries. They were called out in the middle of the night, beaten while walking. Some people's faces were beaten swollen, and after being beaten, they were gathered and locked in the "Biological Museum" for about two weeks before being released.

    “打击一大片，保护一小撮”是资产阶级反动路线的一个组成部分
    （一九六六年六、七两月清华大学工作组在干部问题上执行资产阶级反动路线的情况调查）
    《红旗》杂志编辑部调查员
    清华大学原有校领导干部十一人（党委书记兼校长一人，党委副书记五人，副校长五人），原有党委副部长、党总支副书记、行政副处长、系副主任以上中层干部一百四十五人。原有教职工党支部副书记、教研组副主任以上的基层干部四百余人。共计干部五百多人。
    自从一九六六年六月九日工作组进校宣布“夺权”，代行党委职权后，原有校、系、教研组的党政干部，全部“靠边站”。在学生班上的政治辅导员、党支部书记（乃至支部委员），也不例外。
        工作组进校后，对待干部的作法，大体
    可分三个阶段：
    第一个阶段——从六月九日工作组进校到六月二十三日。工作组对所有干部，全部“撤职罢官”，统统靠边，并赶“上楼”。然后，大搞人人过关检查。实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。
    第二个阶段——从六月二十四日到七月十五日。工作组大搞所谓“反蒯”。同时，“反蒯”与干部检查“下楼”交叉进行，利用干部整群众，煽动干部围攻革命左派，“将功赎罪”。
    第三个阶段——从七月十六日到八月初，工作组撤出为止。工作组大搞所谓对黑帮的“批判”、“斗争”。干部继续检查“下楼”，把一部分干部“挂起来”。
    工作组的具体作法是：
    （一）对干部不作阶级分析，一概排斥、一概打倒
    工作组进校后，六月十一日上午，由副组长杨××召集全校干部大会，宣布工作组来清华“夺权”，并要到会干部“老实交代”。
    他们还在同学中散播：“蒋××坏了，那么从党委、团委到系总支、分团委、党支部也都坏了，各级干部没有一个好的”，“清华是黑窝”，“整个清华的党组织是一个庞大的保皇党”。甚至说：“清华党是黑党”，“清华干部是铁板一块”，“清华干部八年也改造不过来”。
    工作组不准干部看大字报，不准参加运动和任何会议，让他们完全与群众隔绝，成天在屋子里读《修养》。工作组向干部提出，要多读《修养》一书，对照着写“下楼”检查，说“你们过去之所以犯错误，就是因为读这本书读得太少了”。
    系总支书记、支部书记全由工作组兼任或指派，指派的多是他们心目中的“左派”。
    七月十二日，机械系临时党总支成立，大会上先由工作组宣布并通过贺××、胡××、张××转正（贺、胡二人转正提前两个月），然后任命贺××为副书记，张××、胡××、张××为总支委员。宣布时连张××本人也很“突然”，群众问她，她不承认，以致传为笑话。
    在自控系，工作组急急忙忙让刘×提前转正，并指派她任系临时党总支副书记，群众意见纷纷。
    （二）混淆两类不同性质矛盾，“打击一大片，保护
        一小撮”
    对一般干部作敌我矛盾处理。数力系党支委以上、教研组主任以上干部五十五人，被工作组打成“黑帮”、“黑线”的三十九人，占干部总数的百分之七十一。该系党总支委员十二人，百分之一百被打成“黑帮”。
    工作组刚进校，有同学贴出对干部的《十条通令》大字报，工作组说这张大字报“长无产阶级志气，灭资产阶级保皇派威风”，并在全校广播，分别在各系宣布、传达到全体干部。其主要内容是：
    （1）必须彻底交代“黑组织”；
    （2）必须交代假起义，交代幕后策划人；
    （3）六月十四日以前向工作组交出“黑名单”；
    （4）没有工作组的许可，都留在宿舍里，随叫随到，等待审问；
    （5）绝对服从工作组的命令；
    （6）不准动工作组同志一根毫毛。
    这样一来，所有干部都被关在屋子里，成天写检查，写思想汇报、活动汇报，交代材料。出校门要请假，连学生辅导员、级主任也不例外。
    另一方面，工作组对于一小撮真正走资本主义道路的当权派，却极力保护。蒋××在高教部一直未回校。王××七月二十三日对工化系“十七人小组”（蒯大富同志所在的化902班内反蒯的十七名学生组成）讲：“蒋××性质还未定”。刘×（校党委第一副书记），胡×（校党委副书记）五月二十五日至六月二十八日在北京饭店开市的三级干部会议，何××（校党委副书记）则在香山休养，直到七月十八日才返校。刘、胡二人回校后，只斗了一次。对在校的艾××（校党委副书记）多方保护，由于群情激愤，工作组才草草斗了一下。
    （三）在基层干部中大搞人人检查“下楼”
    凡是干部一律靠边站。群众形容：“游街一大串，斗争会一大片，劳改一大队。”这样，走资本主义道路当权派并不感到孤立。
    在基层干部中大搞人人检查“下楼”。某某人在六月十八日给刘×指示：关于党员干部“下楼”的问题，让各班同学讨论一下是不是对所有党员干部都要批评，让他们作检讨。于是，叶×等在六月二十日给市委的报告中明确规定：对基层干部（辅导员、支部书记、支部委员）“一般的采取自我检查，群众批评帮助的办法。”机械系有的级主任检查多达四、五次，才勉强过了关，甚至有的团支委、积极分子，也被工作组确定为“下楼”对象。
    工作组对待基层干部的方针，用他们的话说：
      “层层剥皮”（层层往上剥，先揭基层，后揭党委）；
      “先扫外围，后打黑线”；
      “小鬼揭大鬼”（由下到上）；
      “顺藤摸瓜，内查外调”。
    工作组在群众中散播：“清华的干部都是‘牛’字号的”（意即牛鬼蛇神），清华下面和上面的干部结成“死党”，甚至说“下面比上面更坏”。
    干部检查“下楼”时，有几条标准：
    检查错误　交代罪行
    自觉上纲　挖出黑心
    所谓“上纲”就是要上升到“自觉地执行蒋××的反革命修正主义路线”、“自觉反毛泽东思想”、“自觉反党反对党中央”。
    对基层干部检查“下楼”会，在资产阶级反动路线指使下，工作组副组长杨××亲自作了布置：“要注意煞威风与攻心战相结合，大会煞威风和小会攻心短兵相接相结合。”他说：对干部不能“宽容”，要“尽最大的力量，不漏掉一个坏人”。
    检查“下楼”的范围，实际上几乎是全部党员。工作组提出：“党员凡是原来盲目执行前市委指示的，要检查”；
  “党员凡原来盲目执行校党委的指示的，要检查。”例如机械系共二百零二个党员，确定不准“下楼”的五十九人；经过检查“下楼”的一百一十五人；挂起来的二十八人（据七月十二日工作组宣布的数字）。
    这样一来，群众说：清华是“党员不如团员，团员不如群众”。
    在数力系竟发生这样一件怪事：工作组进校不久，要数力系一个党外“老教授”杜××（旧的资产阶级知识分子）来召开数力系的总支委员会。当时杜在会上说：工作组叫你们老实交代。工作组还派了一个党员作杜的秘书，去作记录。
    （四）利用干部整革命群众
    六月二十四日——七月十五日，工作组进行所谓“反蒯”斗争，这时他们又利用干部把矛头对准革命群众。
    工作组利用干部急于要“下楼”、“解放”的心情，鼓动干部“反蒯”，说这是干部“触及灵魂”、“将功赎罪”的“大好机会”。曾××是蒯大富的班主任，因“反蒯”需要，工作组就让他提前“下楼”了。
    有的干部检查多次，工作组都说不行，但“反蒯有功”，就能迅速“下楼”。例如工程物理系，过去有个“保蒋”的“打手”，因“反蒯”积极，很快“下了楼”。为了“反蒯”，王××要干部“以实际行动表示支持工作组”，要在与蒯大富“辩论”时，恢复党团组织，要党员表态，“下楼”。如不“反蒯”，就让干部长期“挂着”，无法“下楼”。
    七月十日，王××说：只批判少数典型，从而教育了大多数，这样并不矛盾，同时在斗争中提高了，也就解放了一些党员、干部。
      工作组撤走之后，在工作组一手扶植起
  来的清华“三临”（文革临时筹委会、“红卫
  兵”临时总部、临时主席团，都是由贺××、
  刘×主持的）掌权期间，继续在干部问题上
  执行资产阶级反动路线。
    （一）以反工作组对干部“右倾”为名，继续散布
          “打倒一切”的舆论
    他们提出：“清华大学修正主义是一棵黑树，树干是校党委，树枝是下面所有的干部”，因此，应该“全部打倒”，否则“不能除根”。他们在教师、干部吃饭的食堂门口贴了一幅对联：
                氦氖氩氪氙惰性十足
    一群混蛋
                吃喝玩聊睡不问国事
    （二）组织所谓“黑帮劳改队”，大刮“劳改风”
    他们把干部分为三类：
    黑帮分子——校一级干部、总支书记、副书记；
    黑线人物——总支委员、支部书记；
    黑帮爪牙——总支办事员、积极分子。
    然后组成三个劳改队：
    第一劳改队（八月二日——十一月初）：参加人为校一级干部、总支书记、系主任；
    第二劳改队（八月二日——十一月初）：参加人为总支副书记、分团委书记；
    第三劳改队（八月底——十月底）：参加人为支部书记、委员。
    有些政治教师、政治辅导员，也被劳改。
    学校十三个单位中，总支委员以上被劳改的，有九个单位是百分之一百，其他单位都占百分之八十以上。
    党委各部、学校各处负责人，被劳改的，在十四个单位中，有九个单位是百分之一百。
    全校五百多名干部中，被劳改的占百分之七十，没有劳改的大多是年老，有病；有的基层干部，是群众抵制不让劳改的。
    （三）对干部体罚
    八月二十五日晚上，前清华“红卫兵”的一些人，在阶梯教室用皮鞭抽打“劳改队”的干部，被打的多是党委副部长、总支书记、副书记，半夜叫去，边走边打。有的人脸被打肿，打了以后，又把他们集中关在“生物馆”里面，有两个星期左右才放出来。
