Revolutionary youngsters across the country and the broad ranks of proletarian revolutionaries enthusiastically hail the successful birth of the Red Guards Representative Congress of Capital Universities and Colleges amidst the revolutionary storm.

Red Guards and the broad ranks of proletarian revolutionaries in Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Nanjing, Xi'an, Chengdu, Shenyang, and other places, upon hearing the good news, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Organize tens of thousands and millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary force.' The Red Guards of Capital Universities and Colleges have set a good example for us in this regard." Red Guards in Baoding and Yinchuan said, "The revolutionary great alliance of the Capital Universities and Colleges is a new milestone in the history of the Red Guards movement. Whether or not to achieve the revolutionary great alliance, and whether or not to contribute to the revolutionary great alliance, is an important test of true revolutionaries." Some Red Guards in Hangzhou City's schools and colleges expressed their determination to achieve the revolutionary great alliance of Red Guards and the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the principle of 'seeking common ground while reserving differences on minor issues.' They aim to form an invincible revolutionary force that is unstoppable and unconquerable, to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to ensure that all ghosts and monsters are forever unable to rise again, and to guarantee that our country will never change color, making imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries in the world tremble before us!

Red Guards and proletarian revolutionaries in Lanzhou, Hohhot, Changchun, and Changsha said, "The Capital Universities and Colleges Revolutionary Congress has pointed out the correct direction for the revolutionary great alliance. We will definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide to achieve the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries, forming an ironclad fighting force to thoroughly smash the enemy's schemes to sabotage the revolutionary great alliance, and seize new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers expressed: "In the future, we will definitely cherish and support them more closely, help them enthusiastically, and swear to be their strong backbone, fighting and winning together with the broad ranks of Red Guards."

Red Guards in cities like Fuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Lhasa expressed that to achieve a genuine revolutionary great alliance, we must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, treating the 'Three Articles' as our guiding principles, focusing on transforming our worldview, and carrying out a revolution in our souls, breaking away from selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and breaking away from old ideas to establish new ones, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to deeply take root in our minds.

In recent days, Red Guard organizations in universities and colleges in Kunming, Hefei, Nanchang, and Nanning have been conducting open rectification. Many Red Guards have deeply felt that various non-proletarian thoughts are obstacles to achieving the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries. We must firmly grasp the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, as stated in the letter from the Capital Universities and Colleges Revolutionary Congress to all Red Guards, "fighting on two fronts—transforming the objective world and the subjective world; seizing power on two battle lines—seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and seizing power from the 'self' in our minds," eliminating sectarianism, factionalism, small-groupism, and anarchism, strengthening revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline, and forever following Chairman Mao amidst the great winds and waves of class struggle!

    各地革命小将决心向首都大专院校红卫兵学习
    实行大联合　做出新贡献
    据新华社五日讯　全国各地红卫兵小将和广大无产阶级革命派，热烈欢呼首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会在革命的暴风雨中胜利诞生。
    天津、广州、武汉、南京、西安、成都、沈阳等地的红卫兵小将和广大无产阶级革命派听到喜讯，激动地说，毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”首都大专院校红卫兵小将在这方面为我们做出了好榜样。保定、银川等地的红卫兵小将们说，首都大专院校红卫兵实行革命大联合，这是红卫兵运动发展史上的一个新的里程碑。愿不愿意实现革命大联合，是不是为革命大联合出力，是考验真革命假革命的一个重要标志。杭州市大中学校一些红卫兵表示，决心在毛泽东思想基础上，本着“大方向求同，枝节问题存异”的原则，实现红卫兵的革命大联合，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，组成一支浩浩荡荡，战无不胜、攻无不克的革命大军，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，把一切牛鬼蛇神打得永世不得翻身，保证我们的国家永不变色，让帝国主义、现代修正主义和世界上一切反动派在我们的面前发抖！兰州、呼和浩特、长春、长沙等地的红卫兵小将和无产阶级革命派说，首都大专院校红代会给我们指出了革命大联合的正确方向，我们一定以毛泽东思想为指针，实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，结成钢铁般的战斗队伍，彻底粉碎阶级敌人破坏革命大联合的阴谋，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    各地广大工农兵表示：今后一定要更亲切地关怀他们，热情地帮助他们，誓作他们的坚强后盾，和广大红卫兵小将战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    福州、郑州、拉萨等城市学校的红卫兵表示，要实行真正的革命大联合，就必须在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”当做座右铭来学，狠抓世界观的改造，在灵魂深处闹革命，破私立公，破旧立新，让毛泽东思想在自己头脑中深深扎根。
    最近以来，昆明、合肥、南昌、南宁等地大专院校的红卫兵组织，正在开门整风。许多红卫兵深有体会地说，各种非无产阶级思想，是当前实行无产阶级革命派大联合的障碍。我们一定紧紧掌握毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，象首都大专院校红代会告全国红卫兵书中所说的那样，“在两个战场上搏斗——改造客观世界、改造主观世界；在两条火线上夺权——夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权、夺自己头脑中‘私’字的权”，打掉风头主义、山头主义、小团体主义和无政府主义，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，在阶级斗争大风大浪中永远跟着毛主席前进！
