People's Liberation Army propaganda team of a certain artillery regiment of the Shenyang Military Region recently sent cadres to the nearby production brigade to help down-to-county youth study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promoting their ideological revolutionization and mobilizing their enthusiasm for spring ploughing.

There are many down-to-county youth in the vicinity of this artillery regiment's garrison. The regiment's Party committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "At present, it is the spring ploughing season. I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and people of the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production and achieve greater successes than last year." "Youth are the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force.... I hope that Party organizations in various places, together with the Communist Youth League organizations, will study how to specially mobilize the strength of young people, not treat them generally, and not negate their characteristics." They believed that they should follow Chairman Mao's instructions, use Mao Zedong Thought to educate down-to-county youth, promote ideological revolutionization, and make them fully play their role in spring ploughing. Therefore, the regiment's Party committee immediately selected cadres to form a propaganda team and went to the nearby brigade to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the down-to-county youth.

The propaganda team's comrades ate, studied, and worked with the youth. With deep class feelings, they organized everyone to recall the bitterness of the old society, enhancing the youth's love for the new countryside. Many down-to-county youth said, "If we avoid hardship and enjoy the fruits of our parents' labor, we might degenerate into parasites and change the color of our country." They expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in class struggle and production practice, thoroughly transform their worldview, and strive for the construction of a socialist new countryside.

The propaganda team's comrades also organized the down-to-county youth to study "Rectify the Party's Erroneous Thinking," "Oppose Liberalism," and "The General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Reissuance of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," helping them carry out rectification activities and strengthening their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. After studying, the down-to-county youth's spiritual outlook was completely renewed, achieving the goal of being in the mountains but having the nation in mind. They consciously implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the Party Central Committee's instructions, working together to prepare for spring ploughing. In labor, some fearlessly dug manure, with dirt splashing all over their faces without hesitation, and swung their hoes until their hands were covered with blisters without complaining. Some quickly loaded and unloaded manure to the fields, increasing work efficiency several times; some carefully selected good seeds. Female youth Wang Guanju, after studying, not only actively participated in seed selection but also took the initiative to work with male youth, doing heavy and dirty work. Female youth Jiang Xiuying, who performed exceptionally well in spring ploughing preparation, said: "We down-to-county youth grasp the revolution and do well in spring ploughing, which is a powerful blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and lets Chairman Mao's revolutionary line shine forever."

The youth of this production brigade worked day and night for spring ploughing. In the evenings, some self-studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles"; some held study group meetings to discuss and share their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; some sang songs of Mao's quotations with enthusiasm. The brigade cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants saw this situation and joyfully said: "The PLA armed the youth with Mao Zedong Thought, and their revolutionary enthusiasm is full. With this reserve force, we will achieve a double harvest in revolution and production."

    沈阳部队某炮兵团宣传组深入驻地附近生产大队 
    用伟大毛泽东思想武装下乡知识青年
    发挥青年们在春耕生产中的突击作用
    新华社沈阳十七日电　人民解放军沈阳部队某炮兵团最近派出干部到驻地附近生产大队，帮助下乡知识青年活学活用毛主席著作，促进了他们的思想革命化，调动了他们在春耕生产中的积极性。
    这个炮兵团驻地附近的下乡知识青年较多。团党委认真学习了毛主席的教导：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。……希望各地的党组织，协同青年团组织，注意研究如何特别发挥青年人的力量，不要将他们一般看待，抹杀了他们的特点。”他们认为，应该遵循毛主席的教导，用毛泽东思想教育下乡知识青年，促进思想革命化，使他们在春耕生产中充分发挥作用。于是，团党委立即抽调干部组成宣传组，到驻地附近大队向下乡知识青年宣传毛泽东思想。
    部队宣传组的同志和青年们吃在一起，学习在一起，劳动在一起。他们以深厚的阶级感情组织大家回忆万恶的旧社会的苦，增强青年对新农村的热爱。许多知识青年说，我们如果逃避艰苦，坐享父辈的劳动成果，就有可能堕落成为寄生虫，使我们国家改变颜色。他们表示要在阶级斗争和生产实践中，活学活用毛主席著作，狠狠改造世界观，为建设社会主义新农村而奋斗。
    部队宣传组的同志，还组织下乡知识青年学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，《反对自由主义》，《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》等光辉著作，帮助他们开展整风活动，加强了他们的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性。下乡知识青年经过学习，精神面貌焕然一新，做到了身在山村，胸怀全国。他们自觉地贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针和党中央的信，齐心合力投入备耕。在劳动中，有的不怕脏，不怕累地抢着掏粪，脏冰碴溅得满身满脸都不在乎，抡镐的双手打起了一个个血泡也不叫苦。有的赶大车往地里运肥，快装快卸，工效成倍增加；有的眼明手快地精选良种。女青年王冠菊经过学习，不但积极参加选种，还主动和男青年一道，拣重活脏活干。在备耕工作中表现得特别积极的女青年姜秀英说：“我们下乡知识青年抓好革命，搞好春耕，就是给党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派最有力的打击，就是让毛主席的革命路线永放光芒。”
    这个生产大队的知识青年，白天热火朝天闹春耕，一到晚上，有的自学“老三篇”；有的开学习小组会，畅谈交流活学活用毛主席著作体会；有的在纵情高唱毛主席语录歌。生产大队干部和贫下中农社员看见这种情况，喜笑颜开地说：“解放军用毛泽东思想武装了青年，他们的革命干劲就足了，有了这支生力军，就会获得革命生产双丰收。”
