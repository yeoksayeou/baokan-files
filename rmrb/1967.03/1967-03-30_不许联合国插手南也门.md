The flames of the South Yemen people's anti-imperialist struggle are burning brighter and brighter, scorching the British imperialists, leaving them in a state of panic and disarray.

However, British imperialism is still making its last-ditch efforts. South Yemen is an important base for British imperialism to maintain its colonial interests in the Middle East, East Africa, and the so-called "East of Suez" region. To hold onto this base, British imperialism has employed a mix of soft and hard tactics against the fighting people of South Yemen, from bloody massacres to political deception with the promise of "independence." None of these tactics have succeeded. Now, they are simply refusing to leave, disguising British troops as so-called "UN peacekeeping forces" to continue occupying South Yemen.

The United Nations is a tool manipulated by American imperialism. The "UN peacekeeping forces" are an international police force colluding with the Soviet Union to specifically suppress anti-imperialist struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Although British imperialism is wary of American imperialism, it still has to seek help from American imperialism, exposing its weakness and internal panic, while also reflecting the strength of the South Yemen people.

Chairman Mao said, "The jackals of imperialism should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily dispose of the fate of mankind and carve up Asian and African countries at will has passed and will not return." The people of South Yemen and the peoples of Asia and Africa will not allow the crimes committed by the United Nations in the Congo (Leopoldville) to be repeated in South Yemen. If the American and British imperialists and their accomplices, the Soviet revisionists, insist on going their own way, they will surely face severe historical punishment.

### 不许联合国插手南也门

    不许联合国插手南也门
    南也门人民反帝斗争的熊熊烈火越烧越旺，把英帝国主义烧得焦头烂额，手忙脚乱。
    但是，英帝国主义还在作最后的挣扎。南也门是英帝国主义维护它在中东、东非和所谓苏伊士以东地区殖民利益的一个重要侵略基地。为了保住这个基地，英帝国主义对斗争中的南也门人民，使用了软硬兼施的伎俩，从血腥屠杀到恩赐“独立”的政治欺骗。这一切都未能得逞。现在，它干脆想赖着不走，把英国军队改头换面，打着所谓“联合国维持和平部队”的旗号继续占领南也门。
    联合国是美帝国主义一手操纵的工具。“联合国维持和平部队”是美苏勾结专门扑灭亚非拉地区反帝斗争的国际宪兵队。英帝国主义虽然对美帝国主义是怀有戒心的，但是仍然不得不向美帝国主义求救，这就暴露了它力量的虚弱和内心的恐慌，同时也反映了南也门人民力量的强大。
    毛主席说，“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”南也门人民和亚非人民决不容许联合国在刚果（利）的罪行在南也门重演。美英帝国主义和它们的同谋苏修集团硬要一意孤行，必定要受到历史的严厉的惩罚。
