A thunderous spring storm has risen from the ground. During the severe winter season of "cold currents rolling in the high sky," the proletarian revolutionaries in Guizhou have risen up to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, taking the reins of power into their own hands. In the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionary people have displayed extraordinary wisdom and talent, using the power they have seized to do an excellent job in all areas of work. The industrial, transportation, financial, and commercial sectors in the mountainous city of Guiyang have begun to show a great and good situation, and everywhere one can see a vibrant and thriving new scene.

Great unity and great cooperation, thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary economism

Just as the Cultural Revolution in Guizhou Province entered the critical stage of the power seizure struggle, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party stirred up a counter-revolutionary economism, seriously disrupting the normal supply of the Guiyang market. The proletarian revolutionaries of Guiyang deeply understand that doing a good job in market supply and ensuring the needs of the people is a major task in consolidating the power they have seized. The revolutionary forces in the financial and commercial systems of the Guiyang region immediately took effective measures to solve the problem of market supply. The Guiyang Financial and Commercial Combat Corps, the "Burning Flame" Combat Team of the Provincial Commercial Bureau, and twenty other revolutionary mass organizations, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "organizing tens of millions of people, mobilizing a vast revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolutionaries," implemented great unity, jointly issuing an "Emergency Notice" to resolutely overthrow counter-revolutionary revisionist economism. They mobilized all revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary workers on the financial and commercial front to implement great cooperation, jointly blocking the black wind of economism blowing towards the commercial front, defending the position, and striving to do a good job in the collection, transportation, and supply of goods. As a result, the work of market supply was done very well. For example, at one time, the supply of pork in the city was insufficient. The proletarian revolutionaries of the financial and commercial system, under the unified leadership of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Command of the Proletariat, closely cooperated with various revolutionary mass organizations in the city, mobilizing more than ten thousand people to various prefectures and counties to help with the purchase and transportation of live pigs. The "September 5th" Combat Team of the Provincial Commercial School sent more than thirty Red Guards to endure hardships and sufferings, going deep into twenty-seven remote counties such as Sishan, Bijie, and Kaili to help local revolutionaries with the purchase and transportation of live pigs. The revolutionary forces on the financial and commercial front in Kaili County, upon hearing that Guiyang needed pork, actively supported it. Originally, they only needed to transport 1,200 live pigs, but they transported 2,000. Many poor and lower-middle peasants, upon hearing the news that the proletarian revolutionaries in the Guiyang region had seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, were very happy and actively sold their live pigs, supporting the proletarian revolutionaries in the Guiyang region with practical actions.

While strengthening market supply, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Command of the Proletariat also issued orders to resolutely strike down speculators. This measure was also coordinated from top to bottom, relying on the masses to carry out. On the one hand, there was the Red Guards' strong propaganda, creating public opinion; on the other hand, there were specific measures from the public security department. Several aspects launched a powerful offensive against the ghosts and snakes that disrupted the market and the speculators, leaving them no place to hide or stand, thus ensuring a better market supply.

Under the mighty power of the great unity and great cooperation of the proletarian revolutionaries, the counter-revolutionary economism was quickly smashed. Now, the face of the mountainous city has changed, the market supply is improving day by day, and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been further consolidated.

Correctly handling cadres, uniting the majority of the masses

After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionaries in the Guiyang region, in order to better grasp power and better seize the revolution and promote production, pay great attention to uniting the majority of cadres and the masses, fighting and working together with them, and engaging in production together.

After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Guiyang Railway Bureau paid great attention to the issue of how to distinguish and handle cadres. They believed that in handling cadre issues, one should not fall for the class enemy's trick of saying that "all those in power are no good" and not trusting or overthrowing cadres indiscriminately. They selected two mid-level cadres who had stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and passed the test into the production management committee to direct production. For cadres who had made serious mistakes but were willing to reform, they followed the principle of "punishing past mistakes and curing the present, treating the illness and saving the patient" and, under the supervision of the proletarian revolutionaries, allowed them to participate in the production command system, giving them the opportunity to correct their mistakes and make amends. Because of the initial realization of the "three-in-one combination," it played a promotional role in "seizing the revolution and promoting production." During the Spring Festival this year, the number of passengers traveling to and from the Guiyang region was very large, and it seemed impossible to complete such a large transportation task under the conditions at that time. However, because the proletarian revolutionaries organized a team composed of workers, technicians, cadres, and Red Guards, on the one hand, they went to various railway lines and sections to support the local proletarian revolutionaries in their struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and at the same time, they focused on the three key tasks of organizing passengers, inspecting the safety of locomotives and lines, and loading and unloading freight cars; on the other hand, they went deep into factories and mines, vigorously publicizing the State Council's notice that the Spring Festival would not be a holiday, and called on workers to stick to their production posts to reduce the volume of passenger transportation. In this way, not only was the normal order of production restored in half a month, but the loading rate of freight cars was also increased by 25% compared to the half month before the power seizure, the unloading rate increased by 3%, and passenger trains were basically on time.

Many factories and enterprises, while correctly handling cadre issues, also used Mao Zedong Thought to unite the majority of the masses, making the revolution and production both hot and lively. The Qianjiang Machinery and Electrical Installation Company had some workers who were deceived into joining the "patrol teams" of the "preservationist" factions. Because they had said some wrong things and done some wrong things, they opposed revolutionary workers and felt that they could not hold their heads up, and their thoughts were heavy; some even dared not come to work. Facing these situations, the revolutionary workers of the company, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "not only should we unite with those who agree with us, but we should also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us, and we should also be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice," educated the deceived workers, making them put down their burdens and move forward lightly. Several young workers in the second workshop who had participated in the "patrol teams" realized their past mistakes, turned back, and thoroughly criticized the capitalist roaders within the Party. The revolutionary workers immediately expressed: the revolution does not distinguish between early and late, and warmly welcomed them back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary workers often studied Chairman Mao's works with them, had heart-to-heart talks, and actively sought their opinions on production issues. In order to better strengthen the unity of the workers, after seizing power, the revolutionary workers changed the way of activities that were organized by combat organizations in the past to be organized by production organizations, with revolutionary cadres as the backbone, and worked and studied together with the workers who had been deceived into joining the "patrol teams" in the past. When there were differences in views, they unified through debate. In this way, they not only clarified their thoughts but also united their comrades. Some workers who had participated in the "patrol teams" said emotionally: in the past, they were deceived by the class enemy, and in the future, they would definitely join the revolutionary forces to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Now, the production of this company is booming. The company had many difficulties in completing the production plan for February, but because the revolutionary workers united the majority of the masses, everyone put forward ideas and found ways, and finally completed the full-month production plan three days ahead of schedule, firing the first shot after seizing power.

Breaking old frameworks, creating new order

"We not only are good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." The proletarian revolutionaries on the industrial, transportation, and commercial fronts in the Guiyang region followed Chairman Mao's teaching, after seizing power, fiercely fought against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, thoroughly smashed the old rules and regulations and management systems they left behind, and launched a fierce attack on all the foreign frameworks and old routines that shackle productivity; at the same time, they strove to establish a revolutionary new order.

After seizing power, the revolutionary workers of the forging and pressing workshop of the Guizhou Red Star Tractor Factory broke away from the "three-level-one-chief" system that a handful of capitalist-roaders had long ruled the enterprise, establishing a management organization that adapts to the new revolutionary order. This new type of self-management organization from the bottom up can represent the will of the masses and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, greatly promoting the work of breaking the old and establishing the new in production management.

In the past, a set of old management systems tightly shackled the hands and feet of the workers. The workers exposed that a production task assigned to the workers had to go through ten bends; a rationalization suggestion proposed by the workers also had to be approved layer by layer, step by step, and there was no news for ten days or half a month. Now, the revolutionary workers have broken the old system and established a new system. Many rationalization suggestions have been quickly put into use, and the production situation has changed. In the past, the workers of this workshop had proposed many times to combine the two processes of punching the arm hole and expanding the hole in the production of cross picks into one process on the air hammer. However, this suggestion, after being approved layer by layer, disappeared without a trace. After the revolutionary workers took power, they immediately adopted the new operating method, resulting in a nearly twofold increase in work efficiency, a significant reduction in labor intensity, and a saving of manpower.

After the establishment of the new management organization, according to the requirements and suggestions of the broad masses, the "three things before the shift" system was established, that is, every day before work, the following three things must be done: studying Chairman Mao's quotations, not dispersing even if there is thunder; arranging production tasks, everyone is responsible; explaining safety precautions, caring for each other. After insisting on implementing this system, the sense of responsibility of the workers was further strengthened, the enthusiasm of everyone was aroused, and the production tasks were completed excellently. This workshop not only completed the production plan for January ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it, but also completed the production plan for February four days ahead of schedule.

Emphasizing politics, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought

The proletarian revolutionaries in the Guiyang region believe: seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party requires studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and holding power requires studying and applying Chairman Mao's works diligently. After seizing power, they all put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, establishing a "thunder-proof" learning system, and launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many units of the revolutionary forces successively held oath-taking meetings, experience-sharing meetings, and reporting meetings for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, seizing the power of the capitalist-roaders and seizing the "selfish" power in their own minds, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and solving problems in work and production.

The car class of the Guiyang Power Supply Bureau originally had twenty-nine drivers. After the revolutionary forces of the bureau seized power, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party not only threatened the revolutionary forces with slacking off but also incited the members of the "patrol teams" among the drivers to leave their production posts without authorization, leaving only nine drivers in the class.

What to do if there is no one? The revolutionary forces of this class repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," using "firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" to inspire everyone's fighting spirit, one person doing the work of two, ensuring the car needs of the entire bureau. The old worker Zhang Huayun, who was sick, also resolutely returned to the class to participate in production. Comrades advised him to rest, but he replied: "We must ensure the car needs for production. We revolutionary workers are determined to fight for this spirit and to fight for this great breath for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Many units of the revolutionary forces also used Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," and "Opposing Liberalism" as weapons to carry out mass "frontline" rectification. The proletarian revolutionary forces of the Guiyang Railway Bureau conducted rectification learning after each victory. After they seized the administrative power of the bureau from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they immediately studied Chairman Mao's "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," conducted a small rectification, and timely overcame the complacency and self-satisfaction of a few comrades. After they achieved victory in seizing power throughout the bureau, they immediately studied "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and "Opposing Liberalism" and conducted a large rectification, stopping the tendencies of liberalism, windism, and factionalism within the proletarian revolutionary forces. The result of using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to continuously conduct rectification is that the proletarian revolutionary forces are united, have strong fighting power, are invincible, and are irresistible. The power they have seized is held more firmly and better.

At this time of spring returning to the earth, the old strongholds of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the Guiyang region are collapsing, and the proletarian revolutionary forces are advancing with high spirits. A brand-new, red, and shining city of Guiyang, where Mao Zedong Thought shines everywhere, will surely stand firmly on the Guizhou Plateau! (with pictures)

The proletarian revolutionary activists of Guizhou and the PLA activists of studying Chairman Mao's works exchange learning experiences together, determined to unite the broad revolutionary masses, quickly establish a revolutionary new order under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    抓革命促生产，进一步巩固夺权斗争的胜利
    贵阳地区一片新气象
    新华社贵阳十二日电　平地一声春雷起。在“高天滚滚寒流急”的严冬季节，贵州无产阶级革命派起来夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，自己当家作主了。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中，焕发出非凡的聪明和才智，运用已夺得的大权，把各项工作做得非常出色。山城贵阳的工业、交通、财贸等战线，已开始呈现出一派大好形势，到处可以看到一片生机勃勃、欣欣向荣的新景象。
    大联合、大协作，彻底粉碎反革命经济主义
    正当贵州省文化大革命进入夺权斗争的紧要阶段，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派刮起了反革命经济主义的妖风，严重地破坏了贵阳市场的正常供应。贵阳市的无产阶级革命派深深懂得，做好市场供应工作，保证人民生活需要，是一件巩固已经夺得的大权的大事。贵阳地区财贸系统的革命派立即采取有效措施，来解决市场供应问题。贵阳财贸战斗兵团、省商业厅“燎原”战斗队等二十个革命群众组织，根据毛主席“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要”的教导，实行大联合，共同发出了关于坚决打倒反革命修正主义的经济主义的《紧急通告》，发动财贸战线上的各个革命群众组织和革命职工实行大协作，一齐起来挡住刮向商业阵地的经济主义黑风，坚守阵地，努力做好商品的收购、调运、供应等工作。结果市场供应工作做得很出色。例如，有一段时间，市内猪肉供应不足，财贸系统的无产阶级革命派，在贵州省无产阶级革命派总指挥部的统一领导下，紧密与市内各革命群众组织联合起来，抽调了一万多人到各专区、县，帮助收购和调运生猪。省商业学校“九·五”战斗队出动了三十多名红卫兵小将，风餐露宿，忍饥挨冻，深入到思南、毕节、凯里等二十七个边远县区，帮助当地革命派收购和调运生猪。凯里县的财贸战线上的革命派，听说贵阳市需要猪肉，便大力支持，原来只要他们调生猪一千二百头，结果调运了两千头。许多贫下中农得知贵阳地区无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺了权的消息，心里十分高兴，积极出卖生猪，用实际行动来支持贵阳地区的无产阶级革命派。
    在加强市场供应的同时，贵州省无产阶级革命派总指挥部还发出通令，坚决打击投机倒把分子。这一措施，也是上下配合，依靠群众进行的。一方面有红卫兵的大力宣传，造成舆论；一方面有公安部门的具体措施。几个方面一齐向破坏市场的牛鬼蛇神和投机倒把分子发起强大攻势，使他们毫无藏身立足之地，使市场供应得到了更好的保证。
    在无产阶级革命派大联合、大协作的威力下，反革命经济主义的黑风迅速被打垮了，现在，山城面貌焕然一新，市场供应一天天改善，从而更加巩固了无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利。
    正确对待干部，团结大多数群众
    贵阳地区的无产阶级革命派在夺权以后，为了更好地掌好权，更好地抓革命，促生产，都十分重视团结大多数干部和群众，和他们一起斗争，一起工作，一起搞生产。
    贵阳铁路分局无产阶级革命派夺权以后，就十分重视怎样区别对待干部的问题。他们认为，在对待干部问题上，不要上阶级敌人的当，说什么“凡是当权派都不是好东西”，对干部一概不信任，一概打倒。他们把两个经得起考验、始终站在毛主席革命路线一边的中层干部，选进了生产管理委员会，让他们指挥生产。对于犯有严重错误但愿意悔改的干部，本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的原则，在无产阶级革命派监督之下，吸收他们参加生产指挥系统，给他们改正错误立功补过的机会。由于初步实现了“三结合”，对“抓革命，促生产”起了促进作用。今年春节期间，贵阳地区乘客往返的数量很大，要完成这样大的运输任务，在当时条件下似乎是不可能的。但由于无产阶级革命派组织了一支由工人、技术员、干部和红卫兵组成的队伍，一面分赴铁路线站、段，支持当地无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，同时狠抓旅客组织、机车和线路的安全检查、货车的装卸三个关键性工作；一面深入厂矿地区，大力宣传国务院春节不放假的通知，号召职工们坚持生产岗位，以减轻乘客的运输量。这样，不仅在半个月内就恢复了生产的正常秩序，而且货车装车率还比夺权前的半个月提高百分之二十五，卸车率增加百分之三，客车基本正点。
    许多工厂企业在正确处理干部问题的同时，还用毛泽东思想团结大多数群众，使革命和生产都搞得热气腾腾。黔江机电安装公司有一些受蒙蔽参加了保字号的“纠察队”的工人，因为自己曾说过一些错话，办过一些错事，反对过革命派工人，感到抬不起头来，思想包袱很重；有的甚至不敢来上班。针对这些情况，公司的革命派工人，根据毛主席“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”的教导，对受蒙蔽的工人进行教育，使他们放下包袱，轻装前进。第二车间有几个参加过“纠察队”的青年工人，认识到过去的错误，回戈反击，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。革命派工人们当即表示：革命不分先后，热烈欢迎他们回到毛主席革命路线上来。革命派的工人们经常和他们一起学习毛主席著作，一起谈心，生产上的问题也主动去征求他们的意见。为了更好地加强工人的团结，革命派工人在夺权以后，把过去以战斗组织为单位的活动方式，改变为以生产组织为单位，以革命派队员为骨干，和过去受蒙蔽参加“纠察队”的工人一起生产，一起学习，观点有了分歧，就通过辩论来统一。这样，既弄清了思想，又团结了同志。一些参加过“纠察队”的工人感动地说：过去上了阶级敌人的当，今后一定与革命派一道，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    现在，这个公司的生产蒸蒸日上。全公司要完成二月份的生产计划本来存在着许多困难，但由于革命派工人团结了大多数群众，大家共同出主意，想办法，终于提前三天超额完成了全月生产计划，打响了夺权后的第一炮。
     打破旧框框，创造新秩序
    “我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”贵阳地区工业、交通、商业战线上无产阶级革命派遵循毛主席的这一教导，在夺权以后，狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大破他们留下来的旧的规章制度和管理体制，向一切束缚生产力的洋框框、旧套套进行猛烈的进攻；同时努力建立革命的新秩序。
    贵州红星拖拉机厂锻压车间的革命派工人，在夺权以后，破除了过去一小撮走资本主义道路当权派长期统治企业的“三级一长”制，建立了一套适应革命新秩序的管理机构。这种新型的、自下而上的群众自己管理自己的组织形式，能够代表群众的意志，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，大大推动了生产管理中破旧立新的工作。
    过去，这个车间一套旧的管理制度紧紧地束缚着工人群众的手脚。工人们揭发说，一项生产任务下达到工人，竟然要拐十道弯；工人们提出一个合理化建议，也是层层上批，步步下达，十天半月都无音讯。现在革命派工人起来打破了旧制度，建立了新制度，许多合理化建议迅速得到运用，生产面貌一新。过去这个车间的工人曾多次提出建议，要求把十字镐生产过程中打臂孔和扩孔放在空气锤上一次锻成，两道工序合成一道。可是，这个建议经过层层上批，一去无回，没有下落。革命派工人掌权以后，立即采用了新的操作方法，结果工效提高将近两倍，还大大减轻了劳动强度，节约了人力。
    新的管理机构建立以后，根据广大群众的要求和建议，建立了“班前三件事”制度，即每天上班前做到：学习毛主席语录，雷打不散；安排生产任务，人人有责；交代安全注意事项，互相关心。坚持执行这一制度后，进一步加强了工人们的责任感，激发了大家的劳动热情，出色地完成了生产任务。这个车间不仅提前超额完成了元月份的生产计划，而且又提前四天完成了二月份生产计划。
    突出政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    贵阳地区无产阶级革命派认为：夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权要活学活用毛主席著作，掌权更要刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作。他们在夺权后，都把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，建立了“雷打不散”的学习制度，掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。许多单位的革命派先后举行了活学活用毛主席著作的誓师大会、讲用会、报告会，既夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，又夺自己头脑里“私”字的权，用毛泽东思想来武装头脑，解决工作和生产中的问题。
    贵阳供电局汽车班，原来共有二十九名驾驶员。局里革命派夺权以后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不但以怠工来威吓革命派，还煽动驾驶员中的“纠察队”成员擅自离开生产岗位，使全班只剩下九个驾驶员。
    没有人怎么办？这个班的革命派反复学习了“老三篇”，以“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”来鼓舞大家的斗志，一人顶两人干，保证了全局用车的需要。正患着病的老工人常华云，也毅然决然地回班参加生产。同志们劝他休息，他回答说：“我们一定要保证满足生产用车的需要。我们革命派工人就是要争这口气，就是要给无产阶级文化大革命争这口大气。”
    许多单位的革命派还以毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《整顿党的作风》、《反对自由主义》等光辉著作为武器，开展了群众性的“火线”整风。贵阳铁路分局无产阶级革命派，每打一次胜仗就进行一次整风学习，当他们从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺取了分局的行政大权以后，立即学习了毛主席的《将革命进行到底》，进行小整风，及时克服了少数同志的麻痹松劲和骄傲自满思想。他们在全局范围内获得夺权胜利以后，又立即学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》等文章，进行了一次大整风，制止了无产阶级革命派内部的自由主义、风头主义、小团体主义等苗头。用毛泽东思想作指导不断进行整风的结果，无产阶级革命派内部团结一致，战斗力强，所向披靡，锐不可当。所夺得的权越掌越牢，越掌越好。
    在这春回大地的时候，贵阳地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的旧营垒在土崩瓦解，无产阶级革命派正高歌猛进。一个崭新的、红彤彤的、处处闪耀着毛泽东思想光芒的山城贵阳，定将岿然屹立在贵州高原上。（附图片）
