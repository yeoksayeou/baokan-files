Representatives of the Azanian (South Africa) Pan-Africanist Congress hail Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time
Praise the victory of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power through the "three-in-one combination"

CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- N. S. S. J. (Ningrod Sejak), a representative of the Azanian (South Africa) Pan-Africanist Congress, hailed Chairman Mao, the most beloved great leader of the Chinese people, as "the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the beacon of the international proletariat in the era of the rapid demise of imperialism." He said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is an unprecedented great movement in the history of the world communist movement.

In a letter to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, Sejak warmly congratulated the Chinese proletarian revolutionary faction on their great achievements in the Cultural Revolution. He wrote: "Since the beginning of this year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has reached a new height of revolutionary development. The Cultural Revolution has achieved the successes that all genuine revolutionaries hope to achieve and has been met with enthusiastic acclaim."

After enthusiastically praising the great victory of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power through the "three-in-one combination," Sejak pointed out: "The news of this victory has filled the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world with joy, while imperialism, old and new colonialism, modern revisionism, and their lackeys are disheartened." He said that implementing the "three-in-one combination" to seize power can better exercise all power and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

He said: "We hail Chairman Mao Zedong as the beacon of the international proletariat. He is the most resolute Marxist revolutionary of our time, daring to launch the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and develop Marxism-Leninism."

In his letter, he finally emphasized: "Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest Marxism-Leninism of our time. The revolutionary peoples of the world are uniting around the great beacon of the international proletarian revolution—Mao Zedong Thought—to thoroughly and finally overthrow our common enemy—imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and their running dogs."
