The West Line Political Committee of the Congolese (Kinshasa) Patriotic Armed Forces, which is bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, has pointed out that the current urgent task is to mobilize and organize the broad masses of the people, form a broad revolutionary united front, strengthen armed struggle, and establish a genuinely revolutionary party. This is a very important development in the revolutionary struggle of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people.

Chairman Mao said, "To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party." "To lead a revolution to victory, a party must rely on the correctness of its political line and the consolidation of its organization." The West Line Political Committee of the Congolese (Kinshasa) Patriotic Armed Forces has raised precisely this key issue that will determine the success or failure of the Congolese (Kinshasa) revolution.

The experience of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America proves that a revolutionary party must have a correct political line to lead the revolution to victory. It must correctly handle armed struggle and the united front, these two weapons. Conversely, whether or not one can correctly handle the issues of armed struggle and the united front is closely related to the success or failure of the revolutionary party.

A correct political line can only be produced and developed in the course of struggle. It is precisely by summing up the experiences and lessons of three years of struggle that the West Line Political Committee of the Congolese (Kinshasa) Patriotic Armed Forces has put forward this correct revolutionary line. We are deeply convinced that by adhering to this correct revolutionary line, the Congolese (Kinshasa) Patriotic Armed Forces will certainly be able to lead the revolutionary struggle to final victory.

    胜利的保证
    正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行英勇斗争的刚果（利）爱国武装西线政治委员会，指出了当前的紧急任务是：动员和组织广大人民群众，组成广泛的革命统一战线，加强武装斗争，和建立一个真正革命的政党。这是刚果（利）人民的革命斗争一个极其重要的发展。
    毛主席说，“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。”“一个政党要引导革命到胜利，必须依靠自己政治路线的正确和组织上的巩固。”刚果（利）爱国武装西线政治委员会提出的正是这样一个决定刚果（利）革命成败的关键问题。
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民革命斗争的经验证明，一个革命的政党要把革命引导到胜利，必须有正确的政治路线，必须正确地掌握武装斗争和统一战线这两个武器。反过来，能否正确处理武装斗争问题和统一战线问题，密切关系到革命政党的胜利或失败。
    正确的政治路线，只有在斗争中才能产生和发展起来。刚果（利）爱国武装西线政治委员会正是总结了三年的斗争经验和教训，才提出了这样一条正确的革命路线的。我们深信，坚持这条正确的革命路线，刚果（利）爱国武装就一定能够引导革命斗争到最后胜利。
