After Beijing City and its affiliated counties (districts) universally established first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production, the cultural revolution in the suburbs of Beijing was further promoted, and a new high tide in spring production was quickly launched.

The first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production were born in the midst of intense class struggle. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolded in the suburbs of Beijing, how to deal with "seizing the revolution and promoting production" has been one of the focal points of the struggle between two lines, two paths, and two ideologies. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres firmly carried out the great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists played all kinds of tricks to sabotage this great policy. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres waged a resolute struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, bravely shouldering the double burden of revolution and production.

After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Beijing were filled with boundless strength and great encouragement. They firmly responded to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee with practical actions. The revolutionary masses' organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and local garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing City and its affiliated counties (districts) established revolutionary "three-in-one combination" first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production with the spirit of "seizing the day." Subsequently, various communes and production brigades also universally established temporary leading bodies of the "three-in-one combination" to take charge of production work.

The first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production at various levels fully utilized proletarian authority, swiftly and decisively improved the production channels between the upper and lower levels and the left and right, eliminated the phenomenon of no one being responsible for production in some units, concentrated manpower and material resources, and rationally allocated and used them with a focus on key areas. They further mobilized the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

Currently, under the unified leadership of the command posts, the broad masses of commune members in the suburbs of Beijing are fighting with sky-high morale in water conservancy projects, fertilizer accumulation and transportation, and the rush to plant early-maturing crops. More than 3,800 county and commune cadres have gone to the front lines of spring production, seizing the revolution and promoting production, and fighting shoulder to shoulder with the masses. The supporting army of various industries such as agricultural machinery, electricity, finance and trade, and supply and marketing cooperatives are delivering agricultural urgently needed materials to the villages and fields according to the plan.

Through the establishment of revolutionary "three-in-one combination" first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production, various counties (districts) and communes in the suburbs have a large number of cadres who have stepped forward to participate in the leading bodies at various levels. Cadres participating in the work of the command posts at various levels excitedly said: The revolutionary masses trust and support us. We must accept this test, get rid of various selfish thoughts, and firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to create new merits for the people.

The rapid establishment of command posts at various levels has also further promoted the great alliance of various revolutionary mass organizations and rapidly expanded the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary faction.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee never propagated Mao Zedong Thought and never emphasized proletarian politics. After the establishment of the first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production, they resolutely eliminated the poison of revisionism, took the People's Liberation Army as an example, emphasized proletarian politics in all aspects, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, including spring production. Currently, a wave of propagating Mao Zedong Thought and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is surging in the suburbs of Beijing.

To propagate the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," the first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production mobilized a large number of forces to carry out a grand propaganda campaign. To enable the peasant masses living in the deep mountains to directly hear the voices of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary cadres climbed mountains and waded through waters, enduring hardships, and went from house to house to conduct propaganda. Many commune members cheered and spread the news after hearing the reading of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country": "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have sent us a letter!" "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have spoken our hearts!" The broad masses of grassroots cadres also excitedly expressed that they must listen to Chairman Mao's words, stand tall, and create new merits for the people in spring production. While organizing spring production, the first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production at various levels helped various communes and brigades to establish and improve the system of studying Chairman Mao's works and organizations. Many production brigades have already established a system of regularly studying Chairman Mao's works. Many commune members and cadres, regardless of how busy they are with work and how heavy their tasks are, insist on studying Chairman Mao's works and solving all problems in spring production according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Because the first-line command posts to seize the revolution and promote production at various levels emphasized proletarian politics and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, the production in the suburbs of Beijing showed a new situation in a very short time after the establishment of the command posts.

    北京各县区第一线指挥部用毛泽东思想统帅一切
    充分运用无产阶级权威
    掀起了春耕生产新高潮
    新华社二十七日讯　北京市和所属各县（区）普遍建立抓革命促生产第一线指挥部以后，有力地推动了京郊农村文化大革命进一步开展，迅速掀起了春耕生产的新高潮。
    抓革命促生产第一线指挥部是在激烈的阶级斗争中诞生的。无产阶级文化大革命运动在京郊农村展开以后，如何对待“抓革命，促生产”，一直是两条道路、两条路线、两种思想交锋的焦点之一。广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针；党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子则耍尽阴谋诡计，极力破坏这个伟大方针。广大贫下中农和革命干部向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子进行了针锋相对的斗争，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担。
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》公布以后，给京郊广大贫下中农、革命干部带来无穷的力量和极大的鼓舞，他们坚决以实际行动来响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召。北京市和所属各县（区）的革命群众组织、革命领导干部和人民解放军当地驻军，以“只争朝夕”的精神，迅速地建立起革命的“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部。接着，各社、队也普遍地建立了“三结合”的临时领导班子，负责生产工作。
    各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥部充分运用无产阶级权威，雷厉风行地进一步沟通了上下左右的生产渠道，消除了一些单位生产无人负责的现象，集中人力、物力，合理调配，重点使用；进一步调动了广大社员的生产积极性。
    目前，京郊广大社员在指挥部统一领导下，以冲天的干劲投入了兴修水利、积肥送肥和抢播早熟作物的战斗。三千八百多名县、社干部走上春耕生产第一线，抓革命，促生产，和群众并肩战斗。农机、电力、财贸、供销等各行各业的支农大军，按计划把农业急需物资送到村里、地头。
    通过建立革命的“三结合”的抓革命促生产第一线指挥部，京郊各县（区）、社有大批干部站了出来，参加了各级领导班子。参加各级指挥部工作的干部激动地说：革命群众信任、支持我们，我们一定要接受这场考验，去掉各种私心杂念，坚决站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，为人民立新功。
    各级指挥部的迅速建立，也进一步促进了各革命群众组织的大联合，迅速壮大了无产阶级革命派的队伍。
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团从来不宣传毛泽东思想，从来不突出无产阶级政治。抓革命促生产第一线指挥部成立后，坚决肃清修正主义的流毒，以人民解放军为榜样，处处、事事突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，统帅春耕生产。目前，在京郊已掀起了一个宣传毛泽东思想，活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。
    为了宣传《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，抓革命促生产第一线指挥部调动大批力量，开展了一个声势浩大的宣传活动。为了使居住在深山中的农民群众直接听到毛主席、党中央的声音，人民解放军、革命干部爬山涉水，不辞劳苦，一家一家去进行宣传。许多社员听到宣读《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》后，立刻欢呼起来，奔走相告：“毛主席、党中央给我们来信了！”“毛主席、党中央说出了我们心里话！”广大基层干部也兴奋地表示，一定要听毛主席的话，挺起腰杆，在春耕生产中，为人民建立新的功劳。各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥部在组织春耕生产的同时，帮助各社、队建立和健全了毛主席著作学习制度和组织。不少大队已经建立起经常学习毛主席著作的制度。许多社员、干部不管时间多紧，工作多忙，活茬多重，都坚持学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席指示解决春耕生产中的一切问题。毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”由于各级抓革命促生产第一线指挥部突出了无产阶级政治，以毛泽东思想统帅一切，因此，在指挥部建立后很短时间内，京郊生产就出现了新气象。
