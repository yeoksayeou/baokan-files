Our Red Guard youth are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are daring in thought, daring in speech, daring in action, daring in doing, and daring in revolution. Their revolutionary spirit and actions have shaken the world. Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries are trembling with fear in the face of the Red Guards; the revolutionary people of the world highly praise the actions of the Red Guards, enthusiastically cheering, "Excellent!"

All foreign friends who come to China have personally seen the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards and have had personal contact and conversations with them, leaving a deep impression. Many have expressed their desire to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards.

During their visit to China, the Japanese Student Friendship Delegation came into contact with many revolutionary youth. The Chinese youth's boundless love and faith in the great leader Chairman Mao deeply moved them. They said, "We want to learn from Chinese youth to love Chairman Mao in this way." Several adult representatives expressed, "Not only do I want to love Chairman Mao like Chinese youth, but I also want to educate my children to love Chairman Mao."

Our Red Guards are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life. Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries have placed their hopes of restoring capitalism in China on the third generation, which is completely miscalculated.

The Australian Travel Group, which participated in the celebrations of our 17th National Day, had extensive contact with Chinese Red Guards. Wherever they went, they received warm receptions from the Red Guards and had cordial conversations with them. The Australian friends praised China's new red generation, saying, "Chinese youth are ambitious; they all have revolutionary ideals. Your country will always be revolutionary." One member sighed to the Chinese comrades, "If I were one year old now, I would wish to be born in China." They all said, "China's youth will not become revisionists."

The Chinese Red Guards have revolted against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries are terrified and hate it to the core, so they have mobilized all kinds of propaganda machines to slander and defame our Red Guards. However, these malicious slanders cannot deceive anyone.

A traveler from Ceylon, after completing his trip in China, said, "In Canada, I saw many reports about China's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards, most of which were distorted, making people angry. China's Red Guards are idealistic, disciplined, and orderly." A Pakistani friend said, "Outside, they slander the Red Guards as 'hooligans,' but the facts are completely the opposite; they are the finest new generation." Another French friend said, "There are many rumors about China's Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards abroad, but I only believe my own eyes."

The British delegation visiting China had heard many distorted propaganda about China's Cultural Revolution before coming to China. They came to China with a fearful mindset. But countless facts convinced them. One retired accountant said, "British newspapers are ridiculous, saying your Red Guards beat and scold people, and behave rudely, but the facts are not like that at all." An Italian traveler refuted the distorted reports of Western journalists, saying, "They spread rumors, portraying Chinese Red Guards as terrorists. In fact, they are the real terrorists; they want to scare people with lies."

Despite the enemy's slander and defamation, the Red Guards, who have grown in the struggle, will unite with the revolutionary people of the world, fight together, and win together!

    红卫兵是中国最优秀的新的一代
    许多外国朋友深为革命小将的革命精神所感动
    本报讯　我们的红卫兵小将，是无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋，是敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干、敢革命的勇士。他们的革命造反精神和行动震撼全世界。帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派在红卫兵面前吓得胆战心惊；全世界革命人民对红卫兵的革命行动，则给予极高的评价，热情欢呼：“好得很！”
    凡到中国来的外国朋友，亲眼看到了红卫兵的革命精神，亲身与红卫兵接触交谈，更是留下深刻的印象。许多人都表示要学习红卫兵的革命造反精神。
    日本学生友好参观团在中国参观时，接触了许多革命小将。中国青年对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和信仰使他们深受感动。他们说：“我们要学习中国青年这样地热爱毛主席。”其中几位成年的代表表示：“不仅我自己要象中国青年这样热爱毛主席，还要教育我的孩子热爱毛主席。”
    我们的红卫兵是毛主席的红小兵，他们决心跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。帝国主义、修正主义和反动派把在中国复辟资本主义的希望寄托在中国的第三代身上，这完全是打错了算盘。
    来参加我国十七周年国庆庆祝活动的澳大利亚旅行团广泛地接触了中国红卫兵，无论在哪里，都受到了红卫兵的热情接待，他们与红卫兵进行了亲切的交谈。澳大利亚朋友赞扬中国红色的新的一代说：“中国青年是有志气的，他们都有革命的理想。你们的国家也将永远是革命的。”一位团员感慨地对中国同志说：“如果我现在是一岁的话，我愿生在中国。”他们都说：“中国的青年一代是不会变成修正主义的。”
    中国红卫兵造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派怕得要死，恨得要命，便开动各种宣传机器，对我们的红卫兵大肆造谣污蔑。但是这些恶毒的诽谤是骗不了人的。
    一位来自锡兰的旅行者在结束了在中国的旅行之后说：“我在加拿大看到很多关于中国文化大革命和红卫兵的报道，大都是歪曲的，叫人气愤。中国的红卫兵是有理想，守纪律，有秩序的。”一位巴基斯坦朋友说：“外面污蔑红卫兵是
  ‘暴徒’，事实却完全相反，他们是最优秀的新的一代。”另一个法国朋友说：“外面对中国的文化大革命和红卫兵造了许多谣言，但是，我只相信我自己的眼睛。”
    英国访华旅行团在来中国前听到了许多对中国文化大革命的歪曲宣传，他们带着恐惧的心理来到中国。但无数的事实说服了他们。其中一位退休的会计师说：“英国报纸十分可笑，讲你们红卫兵打人骂人，举止粗暴，而事实上完全不是这样。”一位意大利旅行者驳斥西方记者的歪曲报道说：“他们大造谣言，把中国红卫兵说成是恐怖分子。其实他们自己才真正是恐怖分子，他们想用鬼话来吓唬人。”
    任凭敌人的造谣污蔑，在斗争中成长起来的红卫兵，将与世界革命人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
