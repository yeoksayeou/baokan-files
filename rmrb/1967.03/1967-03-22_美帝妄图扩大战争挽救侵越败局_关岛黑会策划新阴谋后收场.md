The U.S. Empire Attempts to Expand the War to Save Its Defeat in Vietnam
Guam Black Meeting Concludes After Planning New Conspiracies

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, news from Guam: U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, who presided over a meeting in Guam to plan further escalation of the military adventure in Vietnam, concluded the two-day meeting on the 20th and 21st. Many pieces of information leaked from the meeting indicate that this was a full-fledged war meeting.

The first day of the meeting was attended by the puppet leaders of South Vietnam, Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu. The communiqué issued after the meeting shows that in the face of imminent disaster on the South Vietnamese battlefield, the master and servant agreed to continue their desperate struggle. The communiqué said that both sides "are determined to defend the freedom of South Vietnam while continuing to seriously seek a dignified peace." Those familiar with American imperialist jargon know that the "freedom" and "peace" it speaks of mean that the American aggressors will continue to occupy South Vietnam and enslave the South Vietnamese people.

According to reports, Nguyen Cao Ky, in the tone of his American masters, raved about expanding the bombing of North Vietnam and even advocated spreading the war to the entire Indochina. Johnson, before leaving for home on the 21st, spoke to reporters and tried to downplay the warlike nature of the meeting. However, he actually admitted that what Nguyen Cao Ky said was what he wanted to say. He said: "The issues that Nguyen Cao Ky discussed in his speech yesterday are also what we are concerned about," and on these issues, "there is no disagreement."

To bolster the morale of the U.S. troops and Saigon puppets in Vietnam, so that they can continue to fight for the new military adventures of the United States, Johnson and others at the meeting and outside the meeting boasted about the so-called "progress" of the U.S. policy in Vietnam in political, military, and economic terms.

At the meeting on the 21st, Johnson discussed the Vietnam war strategy with senior U.S. military and political leaders. The U.S. government kept the content of the meeting secret. However, a reporter from the Associated Press, Hansley, who is close to the U.S. government, sent a commentary from Guam after the meeting, revealing that the atmosphere of the meeting was "hardline" and "all participants agreed that further pressure should be applied to the communists to force them to seek negotiations." Agence France-Presse quoted a "qualified American" in Guam as saying: "important decisions have been made at the meeting," this meeting "will definitely lead to an escalation of the Vietnam War," and the meeting "has actually given the 'green light' to accelerate war activities."

Agence France-Presse also revealed that the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, has been given a "blank check" and can obtain all the reinforcements he needs. This news was later confirmed by U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara and Nguyen Cao Ky. McNamara revealed to reporters that Johnson had told Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu: "His policy will be to continue to meet the 'military needs' of the field commanders." Nguyen Cao Ky also said at a press conference before leaving Guam that if necessary, Johnson was willing to increase the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam.

The U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to escalate the war cannot hide their desperate and weak nature. After hearing Westmoreland's report on the military situation, Johnson admitted to reporters in a low voice: "I think we (in Vietnam) have a difficult, serious, protracted, and troublesome problem, for which we have not yet found an answer." Westmoreland also had to admit in public that the struggle the United States faces in South Vietnam will be long and arduous.

Johnson has already left Guam for home in the evening of the 21st. This war criminal has presided over such a war escalation meeting three times in a little over a year. Every time he holds such a meeting, the Vietnam War escalates significantly, and the United States' feet sink deeper into the mud. This time is no exception.

### 美帝妄图扩大战争挽救侵越败局  关岛黑会策划新阴谋后收场

    美帝妄图扩大战争挽救侵越败局
    关岛黑会策划新阴谋后收场
    据新华社二十一日讯　关岛消息：美国总统约翰逊在关岛主持召开的策划进一步扩大侵越军事冒险的会议，在二十、二十一日举行了两天之后，已经在今天收场。从会上会下透露出来的许多消息表明：这是一次十足的战争会议。
    第一天的会议有南越傀儡头目阮高其、阮文绍参加。会后发表的公报表明，主奴双方在南越战场面临灭顶之灾的情况下，要继续进行拚死的挣扎。公报说什么双方“一致决心保卫南越的自由，同时继续认真地谋求体面的和平”。熟悉美帝国主义黑话的人都知道，它口里所说的“自由”、“和平”就意味着美国侵略强盗要继续霸占南越、奴役南越人民。
    据报道，阮高其按照他的美国主子的腔调，在会上疯狂地鼓吹扩大轰炸越南北方，并且叫嚷把战火扩大到整个印度支那。而约翰逊在二十一日动身回国前向记者发表谈话时，虽然力图冲淡会议的战争性质，但是实际上承认，阮高其讲的就是他要说的。他说：阮高其“在昨天的发言中所谈的这些问题，也正是我们所关心的”，在这些问题上，双方“没有分歧”。
    为了给侵越美军及西贡走狗壮胆，以便于继续驱使他们为美国的新的军事冒险卖命，约翰逊等在会上会下大肆吹嘘美国侵越政策在政治上、军事上、经济上取得的所谓“进展”。
    在二十一日的会议上，约翰逊同美国高级军政头目一起讨论了侵越战略问题。美国官方对会议内容守口如瓶。但是，接近美国官方的合众国际社记者汉斯莱在会后从关岛发出的一条述评新闻中透露，会议的气氛是“强硬的”，“参加会议的人都同意，应该对共产党人进一步施加压力，以迫使他们谋求谈判”。法新社援引在关岛的“有资格的美国人士”的话说：会上“已经作出了重要的决定”，这次会议“肯定会导致越南战争升级”，会议“对加速进行战争活动的措施实际上开了‘绿灯’”。
    法新社还透露，侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰已经取得了一张“空白支票”，可以获得他所需要的一切增援。这则消息先后得到了美国国防部长麦克纳马拉和阮高其的证实。麦克纳马拉向记者透露，约翰逊曾向阮高其、阮文绍表示：他的政策将是继续满足战地指挥官的“军事需要”。阮高其在离开关岛前举行的记者招待会上也说，如果有必要，约翰逊愿意增加在南越的美军。
    美帝国主义蓄意扩大战争的阴谋掩盖不了它焦头烂额的虚弱本质。在听取威斯特摩兰报告军事形势之后，约翰逊对记者语调低沉地承认：“我想，我们（在越南）有一个困难的、严重的、旷日持久的、令人烦恼的问题，对此，我们还没有找到答案”。威斯特摩兰在公开谈话时也不能不承认，美国在南越面临的“斗争将是长期的、艰苦的”。
    约翰逊已经在二十一日晚离关岛回国。这是这个战争瘟神在一年多一点的时间里第三次远渡重洋亲自主持这种扩大战争的会议。他每召开这样一次会议，侵越战争就要大大升一级，而美国的泥足也就陷得越深。这一次也逃脱不了这个规律。
