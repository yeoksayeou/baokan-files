Chairman Mao proposed that in places and units where it is necessary to seize power, the revolutionary policy of "three-in-one combination" must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. This power organ is best named the Revolutionary Committee. This is the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ in Shanxi Province—the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee—holding a collective study session of Chairman Mao's works.

Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Guiyang Cotton Mill have implemented departmental unification, and both revolution and production have taken on a new look. Members of the revolutionary factions of the front spinning section B have formed a united combat team and are now full of confidence in achieving victory in both revolution and production.

Famous labor models nationwide, Chen Yonggui (front left second), Li Shunda (center), and Jie Yue (front right second), have responded resolutely to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" They have actively participated in the cultural revolution. The picture shows them with their proletarian revolutionary comrades.

Proletarian revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution and promote production," have steadfastly held their production posts, smashed economism, and made outstanding contributions to the struggle for power. This is a proletarian revolutionary worker from the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory at his production post.

Revolutionary cadres have come forward to make revolution together with the revolutionary masses. Lu Zhongyi (right third), deputy director of Shanghai Quxin Shipyard and a member of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, has gone deep among the masses, worked together with revolutionary workers, and has been welcomed by the masses.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of Shanghai Tractor Manufacturing Plant have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call, grasped revolution, and promoted production with a fighting posture, racing against time to produce tractors and support spring farming. This is a batch of small tractors being test-driven, ready to be shipped out.

Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shandong Province have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call, supporting spring farming with practical actions. They have worked with the community members with high political enthusiasm to deeply plow the land.

Revolutionary peasants of Shuanghe People's Commune, Bingli County, Heilongjiang Province, have overcome the severe cold with revolutionary enthusiasm and seized the opportunity to fertilize the fields. This brigade has done a good job of preparing for the spring plowing during the cultural revolution, with more and better fertilizer than last year.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗  夺取革命、生产双胜利
    毛主席提出，在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。这是山西省“三结合”的临时权力机构——山西省革命委员会的常委在集体学习毛主席著作。
    贵阳棉纺厂的无产阶级革命派在伟大的毛泽东思想的指导下，实行了按部门的大联合，革命和生产都出现了新面貌。前纺乙班各革命派组织的成员组成联合战斗队后，正满怀信心地夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    全国著名的劳动模范陈永贵（前左二）、李顺达（中）、解悦（前右二），坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”的号召，积极投入文化大革命的洪流中。图为他们和无产阶级革命派战友在一起的情形。
    无产阶级革命派工人遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，坚守生产岗位，粉碎经济主义，为夺权斗争做出了出色的贡献。这是哈尔滨林业机械厂的无产阶级革命派工人在生产岗位上。
    革命的领导干部站出来，和革命群众一起闹革命。上海求新造船厂副厂长陆忠义（右三），是厂革命委员会的委页。他深入群众，和革命职工一起研究，一起劳动，受到了群众的欢迎。
    上海拖拉机制造厂的无产阶级革命派，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，大抓革命，狠促生产，以战斗的姿态，争分夺秒生产拖拉机，支援春耕生产。这是一批小型拖拉机正在试车，准备出厂。
    驻山东省人民解放军指战员，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，以实际行动支持春耕生产。他们以高度的政治热情和社员一起深翻土地。

    黑龙江省勃利县双河人民公社兴安大队的革命农民，以冲天的革命干劲战胜严寒，抓紧时机往田里送粪。这个大队在文化大革命高潮中，备耕工作搞的又快又好，粪肥的数量比去年多，质量也比去年好。
