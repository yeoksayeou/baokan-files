Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the new upsurge of "grasp revolution, promote production," we come to report our joy to you: The Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representatives' Conference has been convened! The poor and lower-middle peasants of Beijing have united! This is another great victory of your brilliant thoughts! This is another great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you!

At this moment when we poor and lower-middle peasants are uniting, uniting, and uniting, we are filled with revolutionary fervor and bursting with joy, shouting a thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Forty years ago, you highly praised the rise of the peasant movement and wrote the great document "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Now, you personally lead and enthusiastically support the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside, giving us the most correct policies and guidelines, and pointing out the direction for our advance.

The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" and the Party Central Committee's regulations and directives on the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside, personally presided over by you, illuminate the path of the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside, ensuring that the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside advances victoriously along the correct track!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Under your wise leadership, we poor and lower-middle peasants have thoroughly criticized the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticized the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, suppressed the counter-revolutionary economic wind, defended the socialist collective economy, smashed the plot of the class enemies to reverse the "Four Clean-ups" cases, defended the achievements of the great "Four Clean-ups" movement, and repulsed the counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside has broken through numerous obstacles and achieved one victory after another, presenting a great and good situation.

Just as the good news is coming in and the songs of victory are ringing out, we have seen the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in the Countryside Across the Country." It is like a timely rain, with every sentence hitting the mark and every matter expressing our intentions. We pledge to you: We will definitely carry it out! We will definitely implement it!

You have taught us: "You should pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We will definitely hold high the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts, carry forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion of the proletariat, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, thoroughly criticize the Four Olds and establish the Four News, and definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao, "grasp revolution, promote production" is your great policy. We will definitely follow it! We will definitely channel the boundless enthusiasm stirred up by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into spring plowing and production, and do a good job in agricultural production. The busy spring plowing season has arrived, and time waits for no one. We poor and lower-middle peasants must act with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," fully play the role of the main force, unite the broad masses, form a mighty revolutionary army, fight a good battle in spring plowing and production, and achieve a bumper harvest in agricultural production!

Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao, we will definitely implement your cadre policy and oppose the fallacy of "overthrowing all those in power." We will enthusiastically support the proletarian cadres in power, resolutely overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and criticize and educate those cadres who have made mistakes according to the principle of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," helping them correct their mistakes. We will definitely smash the plot of the class enemies to shift the direction of the struggle, attack revolutionary cadres, and sabotage "grasp revolution, promote production." We will definitely smash the plot of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to distort your cadre policy and launch a counterattack.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At this busy time of spring plowing, you have sent the People's Liberation Army—the sons and daughters of the people—to support us. This is your greatest concern and support for us. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely learn well from the People's Liberation Army, fight shoulder to shoulder with the army, and achieve new victories in revolution and production.

We poor and lower-middle peasants will strengthen proletarian dictatorship, do a good job in militia construction, firmly grasp the gun, resolutely suppress the sabotage activities of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend spring plowing and production.

Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao, "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" is your great call, and we will definitely respond to it. We will learn from the people of Dazhai and follow the Dazhai path. With a heart loyal to you and a pair of hardworking hands, we will definitely make the red flowers of Dazhai bloom everywhere in the countryside of Beijing's suburbs.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your works are revolutionary treasures, every sentence is truth, and every word is pure gold. We pledge to you: We will read your books word by word, listen to your words sentence by sentence, and follow your instructions item by item. We will not be overwhelmed by heavy tasks, pressed by tight schedules, or discouraged by low culture. We will have achievements but not be puffed up. In our souls, we will fiercely struggle against the "self," sweep the "self" out the door, and firmly establish the "public," letting the "public" settle down and take root, and do a good job in ideological revolutionization.

Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants are unyielding and indomitable. We have only one heart, which is to be forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever follow you forward in the great winds and waves! Sugar-coated bullets cannot knock us down, sweet words cannot deceive us, and tricks cannot topple us. Please rest assured, we will definitely plant the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts on every inch of land in the people's communes of Beijing's countryside, and definitely build the countryside of Beijing's suburbs into a socialist new countryside that forever shines with your thoughts!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand words cannot express our love for you, and ten thousand songs cannot sing out our respect for you. Let us wish you a thousand times and ten thousand times, our most red, most red red sun, long live forever! Long live forever!

    在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，在“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮中，我们向您老人家报喜来了：北京市贫下中农代表会议召开了！北京市贫下中农联合起来了！这是您的光辉思想的又一伟大胜利！这是以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    在我们贫下中农大联合、大团结、大会师的时刻里，我们满怀革命激情，带着胜利的喜悦，千万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！四十年前，您老人家高度赞扬了农民运动的兴起，写下了《湖南农民运动考察报告》这一伟大文献；如今，您老人家又直接领导和热情支持农村无产阶级文化大革命，给我们制定了最正确的方针政策，为我们指明了前进的方向。
      您亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》和党中央关于农村无产阶级文化大革命的规定和指示，照亮了农村无产阶级文化大革命的道路，保证了农村无产阶级文化大革命沿着正确的轨道胜利前进！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在您的英明领导下，我们贫下中农大造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造了地、富、反、坏、右分子的反，煞住了反革命经济主义黑风，保卫了社会主义集体经济，粉碎了阶级敌人翻“四清”案的阴谋，保卫了伟大“四清”运动的成果，打退了资产阶级反动路线的反扑。农村无产阶级文化大革命冲破重重阻力，取得了一个又一个的胜利，呈现出一片大好形势。
    就在这捷报频传，凯歌阵阵的形势下，我们看到了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，真好象一场及时雨，句句话说到了我们的心坎上，件件事表达了我们的心意。我们向您保证：坚决贯彻！坚决执行！
    您教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们一定要高举您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争的矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，要大破四旧，大立四新，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    最最敬爱的毛主席，“抓革命，促生产”是您提出来的伟大方针。我们坚决照办！我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命所激发起来的冲天干劲，用到春耕生产中去，搞好农业生产。当前春耕大忙季节已经到来，时令不饶人，分秒赛黄金。我们贫下中农要用“只争朝夕”的革命精神行动起来，充分发挥主力军的作用，团结广大群众，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，打好春耕生产这一仗，夺取农业生产的大丰收！
      最最敬爱的毛主席，我们坚决执行您的干部政策，反对“打倒一切当权派”的谬论。我们要热情支持无产阶级当权派，坚决打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对犯有错误的干部要本着“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针进行批评教育，帮助他们改正错误。我们坚决粉碎阶级敌人转移斗争的大方向，打击革命干部，破坏“抓革命，促生产”的阴谋，坚决粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派歪曲您的干部政策，进行反攻倒算的阴谋。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在春耕大忙的紧张时刻，您派出了人民子弟兵——中国人民解放军来支援我们。这是您老人家对我们的最大关怀和最大支持。我们贫下中农一定要好好向解放军学习，和解放军并肩战斗，夺取革命和生产的新胜利。
      我们贫下中农要大力加强无产阶级专政，搞好民兵建设，握紧枪杆子，坚决镇压地、富、反、坏、右分子的破坏活动，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫春耕生产。
    最最敬爱的毛主席，“农业学大寨”是您提出的伟大号召，我们最坚决地响应。学大寨人，走大寨路。我们有一颗忠于您的红心和一双勤劳的手，就一定能让大寨红花在北京郊区的农村遍地开放。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的著作是革命的宝书，句句是真理，字字是真金。我们向您宣誓：您的书我们字字读，您的话我们句句听，您的指示我们件件照办。做到任务重压不倒，时间紧挤不倒，文化低难不倒，有成绩夸不倒。在灵魂深处，狠斗“私”字，把“私”字扫地出门，大立“公”字，让“公”字安家落户，搞好思想革命化。
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们贫下中农是压不倒、打不烂的硬汉子。我们只有一个心眼，就是永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远跟着您在大风大浪里奋勇前进！糖衣炮弹打不倒，甜言蜜语骗不了，阴谋诡计搞不垮。请您老人家放心，我们一定要把您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，插遍北京农村人民公社的每寸土地，一定要把北京郊区的农村建设成永远闪耀着您的思想光辉的社会主义新农村！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！千句话说不完我们对您的热爱，万支歌唱不尽我们对您的崇敬，让我们千遍万遍地祝愿您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                                      北京市贫下中农代表会议
                                         一九六七年三月十九日
