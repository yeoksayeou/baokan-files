The news published here today is not merely an introduction to new products. It is a welcome signal. It tells us that with the victorious advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, not only will there be a new leap in people's spiritual outlook, but there will also be a leap in the development of production technology.

The Cultural Revolution has promoted the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. The enthusiasm of revolutionary workers and technicians has greatly increased. They have broken through various shackles that hinder the development of productive forces, thus creating the most favorable conditions for the development of new technologies.

The great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" put forward by Chairman Mao is being turned into a tremendous material force through the practice of the broad masses of revolutionary workers and technicians. Under the impetus of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a situation of great development in production and technology is bound to come!

    可喜的信号
    今天这里发表的，不是简单的介绍新产品的消息。这是一个可喜的信号。它告诉我们：随着无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进展，不但人的精神面貌会有一个新的飞跃，而且在生产技术的发展上，也将出现一个飞跃。
    文化大革命，促进了人的思想革命化，革命工人和技术人员的积极性大大提高，他们破除了各种束缚生产力发展的旧框框，这就为发展新技术创造了最优越的条件。
    毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，正在经过广大革命工人和技术人员的实践，变为巨大的物质力量。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，一个生产大发展、技术大发展的局面，是必然要到来的！
