Mobilize the Masses, Rely on the Masses

	Broadly mobilizing the masses and closely relying on the masses is the fundamental guarantee for the armed forces of many peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to achieve continuous victories in their struggles against imperialism and its lackeys.

	Chairman Mao said, "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on the masses."

	Recently, the guerrilla forces of Thailand, Zimbabwe, and Colombia, while bravely striking at the enemy, have vigorously carried out mass work, conducted political propaganda among the people, and aroused the people to struggle. This fully demonstrates that Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war are being grasped by more and more revolutionary people.

	The masses are the deepest source of the mighty force of revolutionary war, an iron wall that no force can break. All counter-revolutionary armies are against the people and oppress the people. They cannot mobilize the people and can only meet with the people's opposition. On the contrary, the people's armed forces are fighting for the interests of the people and enjoy the support and backing of the masses. Therefore, they can organize the people's forces to overthrow imperialism and the reactionaries.

	By propagating among the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses, the people's war can be better waged. When millions upon millions of revolutionary masses rise up to wage war, the day when imperialism and its lackeys are thoroughly buried will not be far off.

    动员群众　依靠群众
    广泛地发动群众，紧紧地依靠群众，这是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的许多人民武装力量在反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，不断取得胜利的根本保证。
    毛主席说，“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    最近，泰国、津巴布韦、哥伦比亚等国家的人民游击队，在英勇地打击敌人的同时，大力展开群众工作，向人民群众进行政治宣传，唤起人民进行斗争。这充分表明毛主席的人民战争思想正在为越来越多的革命人民所掌握。
    群众是革命战争伟力最深厚的根源，是任何力量也打不垮的铜墙铁壁。一切反革命的军队，是反对人民，压迫人民的。它们不能动员人民，只能遭到人民的反对。相反，人民武装力量是为人民利益而战斗的，得到人民群众的支持和拥护的，所以能够组织起人民的力量把帝国主义和反动派打倒。
    宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，就能更好地进行人民战争。当千千万万革命群众起来进行战争的时候，帝国主义及其走狗被彻底埋葬的日子就不远了。
