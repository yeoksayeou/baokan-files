On the morning of February 24, it was drizzling, and the waves were rolling on the Minjiang River as ships passed through. Around 8 a.m., a passenger ship heading to Fuzhou stopped in the middle of the river near Chang'an Ferry because there was no dock. At this time, 23 Red Guards and revolutionary masses from Chang'an were rowing a small wooden boat towards the ship. As the small boat approached the ship, water from the ship's discharge pipe sprayed into the small boat, causing the people on board to shift their positions suddenly. The small boat lost balance and capsized, throwing everyone into the river.

At this critical moment, the crowd on the shore, about 300 meters away, shouted in alarm, "The boat has capsized! The Red Guards have fallen into the water!" Hearing the shouts outside the window, Zhou Chengying, a logistics assistant from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the ship, saw that the Red Guards were struggling in the waves, their lives in grave danger. Zhou Chengying thought: The Red Guards are personally nurtured by Chairman Mao and are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution, the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. I must protect them like Wang Yuchang protected his comrades-in-arms, even if it means facing knives and fire, I must save them.

Although Zhou Chengying was not a strong swimmer, the images of heroes like Luo Shengjiao, Cai Yongxiang, and Wang Yuchang, who risked their lives to save their class brothers, flashed through his mind. He was filled with boundless wisdom and strength. In his urgency, he opened the ship's window, braved the cold, and dove into the river to rescue the Red Guards and revolutionary masses. Inspired by Zhou Chengying's heroic act, two other passengers also jumped into the water. The ship quickly threw out life-saving equipment, and all the passengers and crew on board joined the rescue effort.

Zhou Chengying, upon entering the water, found that eight or nine of the fallen people were holding onto a life buoy. Due to the weight, they were sinking. Zhou Chengying swiftly swam over, steadied the life buoy, and with all his might, pushed it towards the ship. With the help of the crew, he saved them. Before he could catch his breath, he saw a child struggling to climb onto the ship, but the cold had sapped his strength, and he fell back into the water. Zhou Chengying, despite his fatigue, quickly dove in and pushed the child onto the ship. He then rescued an elderly woman with his last ounce of strength. Zhou Chengying fought in the icy water, saving a total of eleven lives. His skin was blue from the cold, and he could barely stand, but he saw a child about ten meters away struggling in the waves, on the verge of being swallowed by the waves. Zhou Chengying, with determination, saved the child.

Under the joint efforts of Zhou Chengying and the crew, the fallen Red Guards and revolutionary masses were saved. The crowd on the ship and shore were moved to tears, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years! Long live the People's Liberation Army! Learn from the People's Liberation Army! Salute the People's Liberation Army!" At this time, Zhou Chengying was frozen, his teeth chattering, but he did not mind, covering the rescued child with his own coat.

Zhou Chengying's heroic deed of risking his life to save others quickly spread throughout the Minjiang River area. On March 3, the rescued Red Guards and revolutionary masses, with drums and gongs, went to the military camp to present Zhou Chengying with a portrait of Chairman Mao, a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and a banner. They were deeply moved and vowed to learn from the People's Liberation Army to study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

    周承英英勇抢救红卫兵
    二月二十四日清晨，天下着毛毛细雨，闽江口来往客船在波涛翻滚的江面上破浪前进。
    八时许，一艘开往福州的客船经过长安渡口，因无轮船停靠的码头，停在江中，等待乘客。这时，在长安赶渡的二十三个红卫兵和革命群众，划着小木船向轮船靠拢。当小船接近轮船时，因轮船排水管吐出的水喷进小船，船上的人骤然移动位置，小船失去平衡，船翻了，上面的人全部落入江中。
    这时，站在相离三百多米的岸上送行的群众，焦急地大声呼叫：“小船翻了！红卫兵落水了！”在这千钧一发之际，坐在轮船上的解放军某部后勤助理员周承英同志，听到了窗外的呼喊。他转头一看，只见落水的红卫兵正在波浪起伏的江面上忽浮忽沉，生命安全受到严重威胁。周承英想：红卫兵是毛主席亲手培育起来的，是文化大革命的急先锋，是解放军的后备军，我要象王裕昌爱护战士那样，爱护毛主席的红卫兵和革命群众，那怕是上刀山下火海也要把他们救上来。周承英水性虽然不强，但是，在他脑海里闪现着罗盛教、蔡永祥、王裕昌等英雄舍身抢救阶级兄弟的光辉形象，浑身有使不尽的智慧和力量。他急中生智，拉开轮船窗门，冒着严寒，侧身跃入江中，抢救红卫兵和革命群众。在周承英英勇行为的影响下，另外两个旅客也跳到江中。轮船上迅速抛出了救生器材，顿时，船上的旅客和工作人员全部投入了抢救遇险红卫兵和革命群众的战斗。
    周承英跳入水中，发现八、九个落水的人几乎同时抓住一个救生圈。由于人多，超过了救生圈的乘浮力，人还是往下坠。周承英猛力一游，赶上去，急忙稳住救生圈，然后，使出全身力气推着救生圈向轮船游去，在船上人员的帮助下，把他们救上了船。周承英还没来得及喘一口气，就发现一个落水的小孩正抓住船身，吃力地往船上爬，由于天气寒冷，全身冻得没有力气，刚爬出水面，又很快掉入江中。周承英不顾疲劳急忙钻入水中，把这个小孩顶上了船。紧接着，他又使出全身力气，抢救了一位老大娘。周承英在刺骨的江水中战斗，一连抢救了十一个人的生命，皮肤已冻得发青，显然有些支持不住了。可是他又发现前面十多米远的浪头中，有一个十来岁的小孩在挣扎着，随时有被浪头吞没的危险。周承英看在眼里，急在心里，想起毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”决心把小孩救上来。于是，他又投入了紧张的战斗，终于把这个小孩救了上来。
    在周承英和轮船上的人们奋力抢救下，落水的红卫兵和革命群众脱险了！船上、岸上的群众热泪盈眶，激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”“向解放军学习！”“向解放军致敬！”这时，周承英已经冻得全身发紫，牙齿直打寒颤，但他却不顾这些，把自己的棉衣盖在被救上来的小孩身上。
    周承英冒着生命危险救人的事迹迅速在闽江口一带传开了。三月三日被救的红卫兵和革命群众敲锣打鼓到部队驻地，给周承英送来毛主席画像、《毛泽东选集》和一面锦旗。他们激动万分地表示：一定要象解放军那样活学活用毛主席著作，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。新华社通讯员
