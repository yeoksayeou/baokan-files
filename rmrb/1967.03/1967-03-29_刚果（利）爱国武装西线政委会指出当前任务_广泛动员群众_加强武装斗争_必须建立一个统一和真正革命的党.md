The Political Committee of the Western Front of the Congolese Patriotic Armed Forces recently published an article in its journal "Guerrilla Fighter," calling on the Congolese patriotic armed forces to mobilize and organize the broad masses of the people, form a broad revolutionary united front, and strengthen the armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys as the current urgent task.

The article summarizes the experiences and lessons of the Congolese patriotic armed forces in their three years of struggle. The article points out that the first experience and lesson to be drawn from the past struggles is that "the people must be fully mobilized and organized." The article says: "Only by mobilizing and organizing the people can we change the balance of power between the enemy and us. We must regard the mobilization and organization of the people's power as the fundamental guarantee of our victory. Therefore, the issue of mobilizing and organizing the masses is of extremely great strategic significance for the victory of our country's revolution."

The article says: The revolutionary struggle experiences of the people of other countries have proven that, no matter how weak a country is, when its people are politically and ideologically tempered, mobilized, and organized, and have the correct leadership, despite numerous difficulties, the people of this country can fight and resist any powerful enemy and defeat it.

The article says that to complete the arduous task of mobilizing and organizing the masses well, it is necessary to formulate the correct fighting program and political slogans for achieving national democratic revolution. To formulate such a program and slogans, it is necessary to go to the masses, live and struggle with them, understand their problems, difficulties, and demands, and conduct a serious investigation of their lives. Only such a program and slogans can "reflect the objective reality of our country and the deep wishes of our people." "Only then can we mobilize and organize all the people of our country, unite them, and participate in the revolution as one."

The article goes on to point out that now the Congo (L) needs to establish a unified and united, truly revolutionary party. This party must reach a consensus on the issue of using armed struggle as the main form of struggle to liberate the Congolese people. This party must be able to combine revolutionary theory with practice, be selfless, have strict discipline, and be based on the masses, truly reflect the deep wishes of the people, loyally express the people's demands, and defend the people's interests.

The article emphasizes that the cadre issue should be regarded as one of the important factors in the development and victory of the revolution. The victory of the revolution depends on the actual work of mobilizing and organizing the people by cadres at home. The article says: "Therefore, we must urgently focus on this issue to cultivate cadres who can completely and resolutely carry out the revolutionary cause."

When discussing the importance of political struggle in the cities, the article says: "Because we must make the broad masses of the people participate in the revolution, it is very important to give important positions to the mobilization and organization of the masses in the cities."

The article emphasizes that it is necessary to have political struggles in cities and enemy-occupied areas to complement the armed struggle in the countryside.

When discussing the attitude towards foreign aid, the article says: "We must understand that the revolution and liberation of a country is ultimately the cause of the people of that country, not the people of another country. Revolution cannot be imported or exported. To liberate our country, we must mainly rely on our people. Only our people can guarantee our liberation and persist in the revolution to the end."

The article emphasizes that: "A revolution and an armed struggle, if not led and practiced by a conscious, correct, and wise leadership composed of people who are completely loyal to the revolution and the people's cause, cannot lead the revolution and armed struggle to victory."

The article exposes and condemns the atrocities of the imperialist and Mobutu puppet regime's pseudo-army and mercenaries in brutally slaughtering and persecuting innocent Congolese civilians, and calls on the Congolese patriotic people and democratic forces nationwide to unite, achieve revolutionary unity, and strengthen the armed struggle.

The article points out that although the Congolese revolution is currently fluctuating, the Congolese people, taking the heroic Vietnamese people as an example, have proven that the seemingly powerful imperialists and their lackeys can be defeated.

The article concludes by saying that the Congolese people will forever be loyal to the words of their national hero Lumumba before his death: "Our people will sooner or later get rid of all our internal and external enemies, stand up as one person to denounce the despicable colonialism, and restore our dignity in the pure sunshine."

    刚果（利）爱国武装西线政委会指出当前任务
    广泛动员群众　加强武装斗争
    必须建立一个统一和真正革命的党
    新华社二十八日讯　刚果（利）爱国武装西线政治委员会在它出版的刊物《游击战士》最近一期上发表一篇文章，号召刚果（利）爱国武装动员和组织广大人民群众，组成广泛的革命统一战线，加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争，作为当前的紧急任务。
    文章着重总结了刚果（利）爱国武装力量三年斗争的经验和教训。文章指出，从过去的斗争中首先要汲取的经验和教训是必须“充分地发动和组织人民”。文章说：“只有把人民发动和组织起来，才能改变敌我力量的对比。我们必须把发动和组织人民的力量看作是我们取得胜利的根本保证。因此，发动和组织群众的问题，对于我国革命的胜利来说，具有极其重大的战略意义。”
    文章说：其他国家人民的革命斗争经验证明，一个国家，不管它多么弱小，当它的人民在政治上和思想上得到锻炼并且动员和组织起来的时候，并具有正确的领导的时候，尽管有重重困难，这个国家的人民都能够同任何强大的敌人进行斗争与对抗，并且战胜它。
    文章说，为了很好地完成动员和组织群众的艰巨任务，必须制订实现民族民主革命的正确的战斗纲领和政治口号。为了制定这样的纲领和口号，必须首先到群众中去，同群众一起生活，一起斗争，来了解他们的问题，他们的困难和要求，对他们的生活作认真的调查。这样制定的纲领和口号，才能“反映我国的客观实际和我国人民的深切愿望。”“才能把我国全体人民动员起来，组织起来，团结一致地参加革命。”
    文章接着指出，现在刚果（利）需要建立一个统一和团结一致的和真正革命的党。这个党要在关于通过以武装斗争作为主要斗争形式来解放刚果人民这个问题上取得一致的政治观点。这个政党必须是能够把革命理论和实践相结合，不谋私利，纪律严明，并且建立在群众的基础之上，真正体现人民的深切愿望，忠诚表达人民要求和捍卫人民的利益。
    文章强调指出，应当把干部问题看作是革命发展和胜利的重要因素之一。革命的胜利，要靠干部在国内进行动员和组织人民的实际工作。文章说：“所以我们必须紧急地集中考虑这个问题，以培养能够完全坚决地进行革命事业的干部。”
    文章在谈到城市中的政治斗争的重要性时说：“因为我们必须使广大人民群众参加革命，所以给予动员和组织城市中的群众以重要地位，这是很重要的。”
    文章强调说，必须要有城市和敌占区的政治斗争来配合农村的武装斗争。
    文章在谈到对外援的态度时说：“我们必须了解，一个国家的革命和解放，总归只是这个国家的人民的、而不是外国人民的事业。革命是不能输入的，也是不能输出的。为了解放我们的国家，我们必须主要地依靠我国的人民。只有我国人民，才是使我们得以取得我国的解放并把革命坚持到底的保证。”
    文章强调说：“一次革命和一次武装斗争，如果不是由对于革命和人民事业完全赤胆忠心的人组成的一个自觉的、正确的和英明的领导机构来指挥和实践，就不可能把这场革命和武装斗争引向胜利。”
    文章揭露和谴责了帝国主义和蒙博托傀儡政权的伪军和雇佣军残酷屠杀和迫害刚果（利）无辜居民的暴行，并且号召刚果（利）全国爱国人民和民主力量团结起来，实现革命团结，加强武装斗争。
    文章指出，尽管刚果（利）的革命斗争目前有起伏，但是以英勇的越南人民为榜样的刚果（利）人民已经证明，貌似强大的帝国主义者及其走狗是可以打败的。
    文章最后说，刚果（利）人民将永远忠于他们的民族英雄卢蒙巴在他逝世前几天留下的遗言：“我国人民迟早终将摆脱自己的所有内外敌人，将象一个人一样站起来申斥卑鄙无耻的殖民主义，并将在纯洁的阳光下恢复自己的尊严。”
