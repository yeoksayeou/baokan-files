A recent dispatch from a reporter of the Japanese newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun* from South Vietnam reveals the predicament of the U.S. invading forces from February 22 to February 26 as they advanced into the C Liberation Zone. The report states that the C Liberation Zone is located in the western part of Saigon, in the province of Xining, near the Cambodian border, and has long been considered by the U.S. military as an "inviolate sanctuary" that is difficult to attack.

A high-ranking U.S. military intelligence officer said that to prevent the South Vietnamese Liberation Army from "escaping," they conducted "highly secretive" operations before the attack. The U.S. military speculated that this area was the main stronghold of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and aimed to "annihilate" the Liberation Army's combat units in one swoop. "However, the Liberation Army is very mobile. By the time the U.S. forces arrived, they had already moved far away, and from the scene, it was clear that the Liberation Army did not retreat in a hurry but withdrew in an orderly manner, leaving the U.S. forces empty-handed." Where did the South Vietnamese Liberation Army go? The Japanese reporter who accompanied the U.S. forces wrote: "This is a problem that greatly troubles the U.S. forces." A frontline U.S. military officer lamented, "The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has been fighting here for twenty years. We find it very difficult to deal with them."

The report states that in order to find the elusive South Vietnamese Liberation Army, "the U.S. 11th Armored Vehicle Company searched deep into the jungle, about ten kilometers from the Cambodian border. However, this armored vehicle unit and the U.S. infantry that followed the attack were hit by a minefield and suffered losses." The report says that the U.S. invading forces, fearing mines, "move in the jungle by following one person's footsteps, carefully watching the ground as they go." A U.S. non-commissioned officer said helplessly, "We are always waiting, waiting, and suddenly one day we realize we have been surrounded by the Liberation Army at the core. This is the Vietnam War."

The "attack" launched by the U.S. invading forces on this "inviolate sanctuary" of the C Liberation Zone ended in failure. This Japanese reporter concluded in the report that the U.S. forces may launch another "attack" here in the future, but for the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, "isn't the entire territory of Vietnam their 'inviolate sanctuary'!" Every piece of land in South Vietnam is a grave for the invaders.

In the province of Quang Tri, South Vietnam, U.S. Marine Corps units conducting a "sweep" are seen dragging bodies and retreating in disarray.

    南越战场到处都是侵略者的坟墓
    ——日本记者笔下的美军狼狈相
    日本《每日新闻》记者最近自南越发出一篇战地报道，透露二月二十二日到二十六日进犯C解放区的美国侵略军的狼狈情况。报道说，C解放区位于西贡西北的西宁省，接近柬埔寨边境，一向被美军称为难以进攻的“圣域”。
    美军担任情报的高级军官说，为了不使南越解放军“逃走”，进攻前“作了高度的保密工作”。美军猜测这里是南越解放军的主力所在，企图一举“歼灭”解放军的作战部队。“但是民军（指南越解放军）很是机动，等美军到达时早已离远了，而且从现场来看，民军决不是慌忙撤退，而是秩序井然地转移，使美军扑了一个空。”南越解放军哪里去了呢？这个随同美军作战的日本记者写道：“这是美军十分困恼的难题。”前线的一个美军将官哀叹地承认，南越解放军在这块“圣域”打了二十年，“我们很难对付。”
    报道说，为了寻找看不到的南越解放军，“美军第十一装甲车连，一直搜索到距柬埔寨边境约十公里的丛林深处。但是这支装甲车队和跟随进攻的美军步兵却陷入地雷阵而受到损失。”报道说，美国侵略军由于害怕踏中地雷，“在丛林中是一个人跟着一个人的脚印行进的，一边走一边仔细看着地面。”一个美国士官无可奈何地说：“我们老是等待着，等待着，突然有一天我们才会发现已被民军包围在核心，这就是越南战争。”
    美国侵略军对C解放区这块无法战胜的“圣域”发动的“进攻”，以失败而告终了。这个日本记者在报道中最后说，美军今后还可能对这里发动“进攻”，但是对于南越解放军来说，“越南全部领土不就是他们的‘圣域’吗！”越南南方的每一块土地都是侵略者的坟墓。
