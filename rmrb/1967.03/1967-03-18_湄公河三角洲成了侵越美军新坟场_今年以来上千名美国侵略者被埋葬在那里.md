The Mekong Delta has become a new graveyard for U.S. invaders in Vietnam. More than a thousand American aggressors have been buried there since the beginning of this year.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi on the 17th, our correspondent reports: Since the beginning of this year, the liberation forces active in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. invaders who have infiltrated this heroic land, turning the Mekong Delta into a new graveyard for the U.S. aggressors.

Last winter and this spring, while the U.S. imperialists were playing the "peace talks" trick, they intensified their aggression against South Vietnam. Not only did they frequently "sweep" through the central coastal, western highlands, and areas near Saigon, but they also sent large numbers of U.S. aggressors to continuously invade the Mekong Delta region, attempting to occupy the rich liberated areas here. However, just like other battlefields in South Vietnam, the "sweeps" by the U.S. aggressors were met with fierce resistance from the local military and civilians, resulting in heavy losses. In January, a large-scale "sweep" by 4,000 U.S. Marines, directly commanded by the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, in the Thuan Phuoc District of the Ben Tre Province, ended in failure under the heavy blows of the local military and civilians. In this month, the military and civilians of the South Central region, which belongs to the Mekong Delta, annihilated more than 650 U.S. aggressors and over 100 puppet troops. The U.S. 9th Infantry Division had just arrived in the My Tho area near the city of My Tho, in the districts of Phu Dien and Long An, when the local military and civilians immediately established an encirclement to annihilate the Americans, continuously intercepting and attacking the enemy. In the more than ten days from January 22nd to February 10th, the local military and civilians annihilated nearly 150 U.S. aggressors. The military and civilians of Di An Town in the Tien Giang Province, after the U.S. aggressors established a base there, quickly established an encirclement to annihilate the Americans, and in more than a month up to February 15th, they had already annihilated more than 600 U.S. aggressors.

For a long time, the U.S. aggressors have been plotting to "pacify" this region and control this fertile and rich land, attempting to make this region their secure rear base to provide large amounts of manpower and resources for their aggression. After the U.S. aggressors massively increased their troops in South Vietnam in 1965, their plan was for the U.S. military to deal with the people's armed forces in other regions, while concentrating the main forces of the puppet army to "pacify" the Mekong Delta. However, even after the U.S.-puppet clique deployed four main puppet army divisions and many puppet commando camps with tens of thousands of troops, they still could not reverse their predicament and resist the powerful strikes of the people's armed forces. Some of the puppet army's elite units have been decimated and are in disarray. According to incomplete statistics, last year alone, the military and civilians of the Delta region had rendered 65,000 puppet troops combat ineffective. The number of puppet troops deserting is increasing, with more than 17,000 puppet troops deserting in the first half of last year in the South Central region. The stronghold of the U.S.-puppet clique—Saigon—is increasingly under the tight encirclement of the people's armed forces.

It is under this predicament that the U.S. aggressors have had to take direct action, replacing the collapsing puppet army. According to U.S. media reports, in addition to the U.S. troops already sent to the Mekong Delta, the U.S. authorities plan to directly deploy one to two divisions of U.S. troops to this region within this year. It can be foreseen that the battles in the Mekong Delta will become even more intense in the future. However, the military and civilians of the Delta region, with their glorious tradition of struggle and strong resolve, will further unleash the power of the people's war, closely coordinate with other battlefields, and deal even heavier blows to the U.S. aggressors, advancing from victory to new victories.

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary forces on the verge of extinction will inevitably make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The U.S. imperialists' invasion of the Mekong Delta is a manifestation of their desperate struggles, and the result can only be a dead end.

### 湄公河三角洲成了侵越美军新坟场  今年以来上千名美国侵略者被埋葬在那里

    湄公河三角洲成了侵越美军新坟场
    今年以来上千名美国侵略者被埋葬在那里
    据新华社河内十七日电　本社记者报道：今年年初以来，活跃在越南南方湄公河三角洲的解放武装力量，狠狠地打击了窜入这块英雄土地的美国侵略者，使湄公河三角洲成了埋葬美国侵略军的新坟场。
    去冬今春，美帝国主义在玩弄“和谈”骗局的同时，加紧扩大对越南南方的侵略战争。它不仅在越南南方中部沿海、西部高原和西贡附近地区进行频繁的“扫荡”，而且出动大量美国侵略军不断进犯湄公河三角洲地区，妄图侵占这里富饶的解放区。但是，同南越其他战场一样，美国侵略军的“扫荡”遭到英勇的当地军民迎头痛击，损失惨重。今年一月份，由侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰直接指挥的四千名美国海军陆战队向槟椥省盛富县进行的大规模“扫荡”，在当地军民的沉重打击下，以失败而告终。在这个月里，属于湄公河三角洲的南部中区军民，共歼灭美国侵略军六百五十多名和帮凶军一百多名。美国第九步兵师刚刚进驻美萩市附近的周城县平德、隆兴地区，当地军民就立即在基地周围建立了歼美包围圈，连续截击、袭击敌人。从一月二十二日到二月十日的十多天中，当地军民消灭了美国侵略者近一百五十名。堤岸省迪建镇的军民，当美国侵略军在这里设立据点后，也迅速建立了歼美包围圈，在到二月十五日的一个多月中，已经歼灭美国侵略军六百多名。
    长期以来，美国侵略者就蓄谋“绥靖”这个地区，控制这片肥沃富庶的土地，妄图使这个地区成为它的稳固的后方，以便为它的侵略战争提供大量的人力和物力。一九六五年美国侵略者大规模增兵南越以后，它的如意算盘是：由美军来应付其它地区的人民武装力量，而集中伪军的主力来“绥靖”湄公河三角洲。但是美伪集团在这里投入四个伪军主力师和许多伪军别动营共十几万兵力，仍然无法扭转困窘的处境，抵挡不住人民武装力量的强大打击。伪军的一些精锐部队已被打得落花流水，溃不成军。据不完全统计，去年一年，三角洲军民已经使六万五千名伪军丧失战斗力。伪军逃亡人数不断增加，仅南部中区在去年上半年就有一万七千多名伪军开小差。美伪集团统治的老巢——西贡，日益处于人民武装的紧密包围之中。
    正是在这种窘境下，美国侵略者不得不赤膊上阵，以取代土崩瓦解的伪军。据美国报刊透露，除已派到湄公河三角洲的美军外，美国当局计划今年内把一至两个师的美军直接投入这一地区。可以预见，今后湄公河三角洲的战斗将会更加激烈。但是，有着光荣斗争传统和坚强决心的三角洲地区军民，必将进一步发挥人民战争的威力，同其他战场密切配合，给予美国侵略军更加沉重的打击，从胜利走向新的胜利。
    毛主席说：“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝国主义对湄公河三角洲的进犯，正是它进行垂死挣扎的表现，其结果只能是死路一条。
