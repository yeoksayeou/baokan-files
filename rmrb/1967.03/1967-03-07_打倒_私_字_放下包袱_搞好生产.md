I am a cadre of a production brigade. In the past, I had some shortcomings and mistakes in my work. During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the commune members posted some big-character posters about me. When I first saw the big-character posters, my heart "boomed" with an indescribable feeling. My parents heard about it and scolded me, saying that being a cadre is not worth it. I also thought: they posted big-character posters about me, let them post, I won't do it anymore! The more I thought about it, the more depressed I felt. I couldn't sleep at night, smoked a pipe, and then refilled it. My mind was as muddled as the smoke coming out of my mouth.

Unable to sleep, I read Chairman Mao's quotations. I opened the book and read one quotation after another. Chairman Mao said: "Everyone makes mistakes, and we should strive to make fewer. If mistakes are made, they should be corrected quickly and thoroughly." Chairman Mao also said: "We should believe in the masses, and we should believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, we will not be able to accomplish anything." I carefully thought about Chairman Mao's teachings, and my face felt hot. "Being a cadre is not worth it" — what kind of talk is this? Why say it's not worth it? What makes it worth it? The more I thought about it, the more I felt something was wrong. Isn't this just circling around the "self"? Isn't this bourgeois thinking?

A famous labor model once said: "Revolution is voluntary, and we cannot have a hired mentality. Revolution is not a business, not doing it for him, doing it for whom? For the higher-ups? The higher-ups are doing it for whom? We are not just communists in one village, we are communists in China, working for the Chinese people and the people of the world, not for that person. At any time, we cannot be petty."

I felt as if these words were spoken directly to me. Why, after seeing the big-character posters, did I feel agitated and want to lie down and not do it? Isn't this just showing that I don't believe in the masses, don't believe in the Party, and that my consciousness is not high enough?

At this time, some people with ill intentions whispered to me: "Son, give them a hard time, vent your anger, see if they dare to criticize you so harshly!" "They say you are fake, so just don't do it, let them be real!" Hearing these words, I became even more vigilant: if I lie down and don't do it out of spite, isn't this exactly falling into the trap of the class enemies? Those class enemies hiding in the dark corners want us to lie down and not do it, causing production to be paralyzed, so as to achieve their despicable goal of sabotaging production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We are cadres who have grown up under the guidance of Chairman Mao. We must do it! And we must do it better than before! We must not let the class enemies' plots succeed.

Now, the task of spring plowing is in front of us, and Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have issued a call. We must respond to this great call, immediately straighten our backs, go to the masses, and bravely shoulder the burden of spring plowing.

    打倒“私”字　放下包袱　搞好生产
    我是一个生产队干部。过去，我在工作中有过一些缺点和错误。在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，社员们给我贴了一些大字报。当我开始看到大字报的时候，心里“轰”的一下子，有一股说不出来的味道。父母听说以后，就把我埋怨了一顿，说当干部划不着。我自己也想：他们给我贴大字报，贴吧，反正我不干啦！我越想越苦闷，晚上觉也睡不着，吸了一锅烟，又装上一锅，脑子里象嘴里吐出来的烟雾一样，混混沌沌。
    睡不着，我就看毛主席语录。打开语录本，看了一条又一条。毛主席说：“任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”毛主席又说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”我仔细想想毛主席的教导，不觉脸上热辣辣的。“当干部划不着”这是什么话？为什么说“划不着”呢？怎样才算划得着呢？我越想越觉得不对劲，这不是在“私”字上打圈子吗？这不是资产阶级思想吗？
    有一位著名的劳动模范曾经说过一段话：“干革命是自觉的，不能有雇佣观点。革命不是做买卖，不给他干啦，给谁干呢？给上级领导干吗？上级领导又是给谁干呢？我们不是一个村里的共产党员，是中国共产党员，是为中国人民和世界人民干的，不是给那个人干的，任何时候也不能赌气。”我好象觉得这些话是专门说给我听的。为什么看到大字报以后，就心里激动，想躺下不干呢，这不正是说明我不相信群众，不相信党吗？说明我的觉悟不够高吗？
    正当我闹情绪的时候，有些不怀好意的人就风言风语地对我说：“娃子啊，狠整他们几家伙，出出气，看他们以后还扣咱那么紧！”“他们说你假积极，干脆不干算啦，让他们真积极去！”听了这些话，我更加警惕了：我赌气躺倒不干，不是正中了阶级敌人的诡计么？那些躲在暗角里的阶级敌人，正想叫我们躺倒不干，使生产陷于瘫痪，好达到他们破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的卑鄙目的。
    我们是在毛主席教导下成长起来的干部，我们一定要干！而且要比过去干得更好！决不能让阶级敌人的阴谋得逞。
    现在，春耕生产的任务已经摆在我们面前，毛主席和党中央也已经发出了号召。我们一定要响应这个伟大号召，立即挺起腰杆来，走到群众中去，勇敢地挑起春耕生产的担子。
