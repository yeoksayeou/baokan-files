People's Liberation Army soldiers from the Guangzhou Military Region Artillery Unit, while supporting rural people's communes in spring plowing, enthusiastically passed on the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army emphasizing politics and political work experience to rural grassroots cadres. This helped the cadres consciously emphasize proletarian politics and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to direct spring plowing.

In some production brigades where this unit is stationed, part of the leadership consists of young people. They have high revolutionary enthusiasm and plenty of initiative, and their determination to do a good job in spring plowing is great. However, they lack experience, especially in political work. Therefore, the soldiers, based on the specific situations of these cadres, organized them to study Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," as well as Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics and relevant editorials and articles from the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and Liberation Army Daily. This helped them understand that whether or not to emphasize politics is not a small matter but a big issue concerning whether the brigade walks the socialist path or the capitalist path. Emphasizing politics means to focus on class struggle and arm oneself and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers shared their personal experiences to enlighten them, helping them deepen their understanding of the great significance of emphasizing politics.

The brigade leader of the production brigade where the Third Company is stationed, He Yue Luo, initially had a poor understanding of emphasizing politics. He thought that since it was the busy spring plowing season, he should focus on production and neglect people's ideological work, not emphasizing politics. As a result, production was not well managed. Sergeant Zhang Guo Dong then shared with him his experience as a platoon leader, using vivid examples from his own life to explain to the brigade leader that neglecting politics leads to failure in all aspects, while emphasizing politics leads to success in all aspects. He also explained that the more work there is, the heavier the tasks, and the tighter the time, the more politics should be emphasized. After hearing this, He Yue Luo was greatly educated and broke free from the narrow view of focusing solely on production. He organized the commune members to study Chairman Mao's works, raising their consciousness, and making the brigade's revolution and production both vigorous.

The brigade leader of the production brigade where the Ninth Company is stationed, Gao Zhi You, initially did not know how to start emphasizing politics. Command Sergeant Li Zhao Xing enthusiastically helped him to focus on class struggle, using the perspective of class and class struggle to observe, analyze, and handle problems. At that time, some bad elements incited the masses to divide the public accumulation fund of the production brigade. Gao Zhi You, based on the experience passed on by the Liberation Army, first studied Chairman Mao's discussions on class and class struggle. After studying, he saw clearly that this was a counter-revolutionary economic wind blowing into the production brigade. Later, he uncovered the bad element causing the trouble. He then used this incident as a living example, convened a commune meeting, denounced the crimes of the class enemy, and foiled the enemy's plot. After this class struggle, the brigade's cadres and commune members had higher revolutionary enthusiasm and greater initiative. They worked together to quickly launch a spring plowing production campaign.

While passing on the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army emphasizing politics and political thought work experience to rural grassroots cadres, the soldiers adopted the method of both speaking and demonstrating. They were enthusiastic in helping but did not take over the work. They said, "Passing on experience should be passed to the heart, not just the hand." The responsible person of the leadership team for revolution and production in the production brigade where the Sixth Company is stationed, He Shi Yuan, lacked experience in ideological work and did not know how to start emphasizing politics. The political instructor of the Sixth Company, Lyu Bao An, on the one hand, let him work independently, and on the other hand, served as his advisor in actual work. Initially, He Shi Yuan only paid attention to general calls to action in his work and did not pay attention to grasping the active thoughts of the commune members. Lyu Bao An then studied with him Chairman Mao's teaching: "Grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles. If this task is not completed, the party's political tasks cannot be accomplished." He also introduced to him the experience of army cadres and himself in grasping ideological education and active thoughts. With Lyu Bao An's help, He Shi Yuan paid attention to understanding the thought patterns of young people, elderly people, and returned educated youth in his work. During the spring plowing season, he moved the study of Chairman Mao's works and the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works to the fields. He organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings during labor rest time, vigorously publicizing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to all poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes. This made the revolution and production of this production brigade both in a great situation.

    广州部队炮兵某部指战员热情传授经验
    帮助农村干部突出无产阶级政治
    自觉用毛泽东思想指挥春耕生产
    据新华社广州二十七日电　人民解放军驻广州部队炮兵某部指战员，在支援农村人民公社春耕生产中，满腔热情地向农村基层干部言传身教人民解放军突出政治的光荣传统和政治工作的经验，使农村基层干部自觉地突出无产阶级政治，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来指挥春耕生产。
    这支部队所在的一些生产队的领导班子中，有一部分是青年人，他们革命热情高，干劲足，搞好春耕生产的决心很大，但是经验不足，特别缺乏政治工作的经验。于是，指战员们分别根据他们的具体情况，组织他们学习毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，学习林彪副主席关于突出政治的指示以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》等报刊上的有关社论和文章，使他们认识到：搞不搞突出政治，绝不是一件小事情，而是关系到生产队走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大问题。突出政治，就是大抓阶级斗争，用毛泽东思想武装自己和群众的头脑。指战员们现身说法，用自己的切身体会来启发他们，使他们进一步加深对突出政治伟大意义的认识。三连所在地生产队队长何跃罗，开始对突出政治认识不足，认为现在正是春耕大忙季节，就忙着抓生产，忽略了做人的思想工作，不突出政治，结果生产也没有抓好。排长张国栋就向他讲述自己在当班长时以军事冲击政治的教训，他用自己亲身经历过的生动事例，向生产队长说明冲击了政治就一冲百空，突出了政治就一通百通，以及在工作越多，任务越重，时间越紧的情况下越要突出政治的道理。何跃罗听了以后受到很大教育，他从单纯生产观点的圈子里跳了出来，注意组织社员群众学习毛主席著作，提高了社员群众的觉悟，使队里的革命和生产都搞得轰轰烈烈。九连所在的生产队的队长高志友，开始不知道突出政治应该从那里着手。指挥排长李造兴就热情帮助他要抓阶级斗争，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点来观察问题，分析问题，处理问题。当时，有坏分子挑动群众要分掉生产队的公积金，高志友就根据解放军传授的经验，首先学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述。经过学习，他心里豁然开朗，看清这是反革命经济主义黑风刮到了生产队。后来又查清了这个兴风作浪的坏分子，于是他抓住这件事作为活教材，召开社员大会，声讨阶级敌人的罪行，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。经过这场阶级斗争，这个生产队的干部和社员革命热情更高，干劲更大，同心协力，很快掀起春耕生产高潮。
    在向农村基层干部传授人民解放军突出政治的光荣传统和政治思想工作的经验时，指战员们采取了言传身教的办法，既满腔热情帮助，但又不包办代替。他们说：“传经不能传在手上，要传到心里。”六连所在的生产队抓革命促生产领导班子的负责人何世远，由于缺乏做政治思想工作的经验，对突出政治不知从何下手，六连指导员吕保安就一面放手让他工作，一面在实际工作中当他的参谋。起初何世远在工作中只注意一般号召，不注意掌握社员的活思想，吕保安就和他一起学习毛主席的教导：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”并向他介绍部队干部和自己掌握思想教育和抓活思想的经验。在吕保安的帮助下，何世远在工作中注意了解青年人、老年人、回乡知识青年等各类人员的思想规律，在春耕生产中，他根据农忙季节的特点，把学习毛主席著作和活学活用毛主席著作讲用会都搬到了田头，针对社员的活思想，利用劳动休息的时间，及时组织大家学习毛主席的有关教导，大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，使这个生产队的革命和生产都出现一派大好形势。
