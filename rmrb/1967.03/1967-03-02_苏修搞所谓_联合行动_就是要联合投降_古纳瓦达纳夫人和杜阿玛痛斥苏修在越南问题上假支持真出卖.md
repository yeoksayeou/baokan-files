The Soviet revisionists' so-called "joint action" is a plot for joint surrender. Mrs. Thiga Gunawadana and Du Amah denounce the Soviet revisionists' false support and true betrayal on the Vietnam issue.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Colombo news: The vice-chairman of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association and Sri Lankan female writer Thiga Gunawadana recently delivered a speech pointing out that the Soviet modern revisionist leadership's propaganda of the so-called "China obstructing the joint action to support Vietnam" is absurd. She said, "Joint action must be principled and anti-imperialist, not kneeling and betraying."

	Mrs. Gunawadana delivered this speech on March 23 at a discussion meeting on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China held in Colombo. She pointed out that the Soviet revisionists' "joint action" on the Vietnam issue is a conspiracy, aiming to achieve joint surrender. The revisionists are eagerly seeking ways to compromise with U.S. imperialism and are in agreement with the U.S. imperialists who are peddling the "peace talks" fraud.

	She said, since the revisionists have abandoned the dictatorship of the proletariat, advocated class cooperation, and abandoned the struggle against imperialism, how can they support the struggle of the Vietnamese people?

	She cited facts to point out that the Soviet modern revisionist leadership peddles fake Marxist theories and, together with U.S. imperialism, suppresses the anti-imperialist struggles of the people in some countries.

	According to Yangon news, Burmese female writer Du Amah recently published a series of articles in the "People's Daily" exposing the Soviet revisionists' anti-China and anti-people crimes in various aspects. In her article published on the 25th, she pointed out that the Soviet revisionists' so-called "joint action to support Vietnam" is hypocritical. Its true purpose is to force the Vietnamese people to accept "peace talks." It is not surprising that the Chinese people reject such "joint action."

	She pointed out that the Soviet revisionists have recently taken a series of anti-China actions, spreading many rumors to slander China, yet talking about "friendship with China," which is also hypocritical.

	Du Amah published an article in the "People's Daily" on the 27th pointing out: "The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation is an obstacle to the cooperation between the Soviet revisionist leadership and U.S. imperialism. The longer the Vietnam War lasts, the more the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leaders is exposed. Therefore, these revisionist leaders are eager to end this war through surrender negotiations."

	She said, "The Vietnamese revolution is a part of the world revolution. We should condemn the United States for intensifying war blackmail and expose and condemn those who want to negotiate with the United States and betray the Vietnamese revolution."

    苏修搞所谓“联合行动”就是要联合投降
    古纳瓦达纳夫人和杜阿玛痛斥苏修在越南问题上假支持真出卖
    据新华社讯　科伦坡消息：锡中友好协会副主席、锡兰女作家特加·古纳瓦达纳夫人最近发表讲话，指出苏联现代修正主义领导集团散布的所谓“中国妨碍支援越南的联合行动”的说法是荒谬的。她说，“联合行动必须是有原则的而且是反帝的，不能是屈膝背叛。”
    古纳瓦达纳夫人二十三日在科伦坡举行的一次关于中国无产阶级文化大革命的讨论会上发表了这次讲话。她指出，苏修在越南问题上搞的“联合行动”是一个阴谋，是打算搞联合投降。修正主义者竭力寻找同美帝国主义妥协的“解决办法”，同兜售
  “和谈”骗局的美帝国主义者采取一致行动。
    她说，修正主义者既然放弃了无产阶级专政，鼓吹阶级合作，放弃了反对帝国主义的斗争，他们怎么会支持越南人民的斗争呢？
    她列举事实指出，苏联现代修正主义领导集团兜售冒牌的马克思主义理论，同美帝国主义一道压制一些国家的人民的反帝斗争。
    据仰光消息，缅甸女作家杜阿玛最近接连在《人民报》上发表文章，揭露苏修在各方面的反华、反人民的罪行。她在二十五日发表的文章指出，苏修的所谓“支援越南的联合行动”是虚伪的。它的真正目的是迫使越南人民接受“和谈”。中国人民拒绝这种“联合行动”是不足为奇的。
    她指出，苏修最近采取了一系列的反华行动，散布了许多谣言来诬蔑中国，却大谈什么“对中国友好”，这也是虚伪的。
    杜阿玛二十七日在《人民报》上发表文章指出：“越南人民的抗美救国战争是苏修领导集团同美帝国主义谋求合作的一个障碍。越南战争多打一天，苏修领导人的叛徒面目就越加暴露。因此，这些修正主义领导人竭力要通过投降谈判来结束这场战争。”
    她说：“越南革命是世界革命的一部分。我们应当谴责美国加紧进行战争讹诈，揭露和谴责那些要同美国谈判、出卖越南革命的人。”
