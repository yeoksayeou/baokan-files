Japanese and American newspapers have revealed the inside story of the Soviet-American deal on the Vietnam issue, exposing the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionists.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on March 25, the Soviet revisionist leadership is hastening to serve the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression in Vietnam, attempting to sacrifice the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people in exchange for a deal with U.S. imperialism. This treacherous act is increasingly exposed to the world. Some bourgeois newspapers in Japan, the United States, and other Western countries have widely reported that, although the Soviet revisionist leadership's evil plot has not yet succeeded, it is not giving up. "A truly important negotiation on the Vietnam issue is underway between Washington and Moscow."

On March 23, the Japanese newspaper *Asahi Shimbun* published a front-page headline article by its correspondent in Washington, revealing the "inside story" of the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to push the "bombing halt and talks" plot in February. The article stated: "From last Christmas's ceasefire until this January, the Vietnam War intensified further... From this time on, a series of (planning for talks) activities began in Moscow."

The report said that during this period, some countries and individuals, such as U.N. Secretary-General U Thant and the Pope, also ran errands for this U.S. plot, attempting to use the Lunar New Year ceasefire to start "peace talks." However, "the most astonishing activities were carried out by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union officially condemned the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, but behind the scenes, it actively worked to use the 'halt of bombing North Vietnam' as a condition to start talks. Kosygin's visit to London was to complete this work."

The March 23 issue of the American newspaper *New York Herald Tribune* also published a similar "backstage news." The news said that during his visit to the UK, Kosygin vigorously advocated "bombing halt talks," even publicly stating that "the Soviet Union is not without influence on Hanoi," shamelessly volunteering to serve the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" deception. British Prime Minister "Wilson told all this to Johnson," and Washington immediately "made extensive efforts" to concoct a set of "peace talks" proposals, attempting to achieve the U.S. goal of luring Vietnam to surrender through Kosygin.

Due to the failure of this U.S.-Soviet conspiracy, Johnson recently personally went to Guam to hold a war conference, planning to further expand the war of adventure in Vietnam and exert greater war "pressure" on the Vietnamese people. However, U.S. imperialism has not abandoned its established policy of continuing to use the Soviet revisionists to coerce the Vietnamese people into surrender. The March 22 issue of the American newspaper *Christian Science Monitor* reported: Johnson is now making equal efforts to "try to win the Vietnam War" and to intensify collusion with the Soviet revisionists.

The March 27 issue of *U.S. News & World Report*, which was published early, also said that U.S. political figures believe that "Johnson is so eager to resolve the Vietnam War before next year's election" that he is now willing to make every effort to urge the Soviet revisionist leadership to "use any means they may have to end this war."

The British magazine *The Economist* commented in an article on March 11 on the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national liberation struggle, pointing out that the two countries are making a "package deal": to "maintain the status quo" in Europe and Asia. In Asia, this means that the Soviet Union will agree to "end the Vietnam War on terms acceptable to the United States." The article said that the Soviet revisionist leadership is eager to convene a meeting of its followers, one of whose purposes is to exert pressure on the Vietnamese people to "end this Vietnam War."

    日美等国报刊透露苏美在越南问题上大做交易的内幕
    苏修叛徒嘴脸暴露无遗
    据新华社二十五日讯 苏联修正主义领导集团加紧为美帝国主义侵越政策效劳，企图牺牲越南人民的根本利益同美帝国主义作交易的叛卖行径，日益暴露于光天化日之下。日本、美国和其他西方国家的一些资产阶级报刊广泛透露，尽管苏修领导集团的这种罪恶企图迄今未能得逞，但是它并不死心，一场关于越南问题的“真正重要的谈判，正在华盛顿和莫斯科之间进行”。
    日本《朝日新闻》二十三日晚刊以头版头条地位，刊载这家报纸驻华盛顿记者的一篇报道，透露了美苏合谋在今年二月间推行“停炸诱和”阴谋的“内幕”。这篇报道写道：“从去年圣诞节停战后直到今年一月，越南战争进一步激化……从这个时候开始，在莫斯科开始一连串（策划和谈）的活动”。
    报道说，在这个时期，还有一些国家和个人，如联合国秘书长吴丹及罗马教皇等人，也在为美国的这一阴谋奔走效劳，企图利用春节停火导致“和谈”的开始，但是，“在这当中，展开了惊人的活动的是苏联。苏联在正式场合也谴责美国轰炸北越，但在背后，为了把‘停炸北越’作为开始和谈的条件，进行了积极的活动。柯西金访问伦敦，就是为了最后地完成这项工作。”
    二十三日的美国《纽约先驱论坛报》也刊登了一条类似的“幕后消息”。消息说，柯西金在访英时大肆鼓吹“停炸谈判”，他甚至公然表示“苏联对河内不是没有影响的”，恬不知耻地主动争取为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局效劳。英国首相“威尔逊把这一切都告诉了约翰逊”，而华盛顿立即“作了广泛的努力”，拼凑一整套“和谈”建议，企图通过柯西金来达到美国诱降的目的。
    由于美帝苏修的这一阴谋没有得逞，约翰逊最近亲自跑到关岛召开战争会议，策划进一步扩大在越南的战争冒险，对越南人民施加更大的战争“压力”。但是，美帝国主义并没有因此而放弃它继续利用苏修来诱迫越南人民投降的既定方针。三月二十二日的美国《基督教科学箴言报》报道说：约翰逊现在正在为“试图赢得越南战争”和加紧同苏修的勾结，“作出同等的努力”。
    提前出版的三月二十七日一期的《美国新闻与世界报道》也说，美国政界人士认为，“约翰逊是如此地急于在明年大选前解决越南战争”，他现在愿意作出一切努力来促使苏修领导集团“运用他们可能有的任何手段来结束这场战争”。
    英国《经济学家》周刊在三月十一日的一篇文章中评论美苏共谋扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火时指出，美苏两国正在作一笔“一揽子”的交易：在欧洲和亚洲都“维持原状”。在亚洲，这就意味着苏联将同意“按照美国可以接受的条件结束越南战争”。文章说，苏修领导集团亟谋纠集它的追随者开会，其目的之一是为了对越南人民施加压力，以迫使“结束这场越南战争”。
