Indonesian student in the Soviet Union, Suarso, strongly condemns the Soviet revisionists' collusion with the U.S. imperialists and the Indonesian reactionaries

New China News Agency, March 10th - Recently expelled from the Soviet Union by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique and arrived in Beijing, Indonesian Communist Party member, member of the National Committee of the Indonesian People's Youth League, and Indonesian student in the Soviet Union, Suarso, recently issued a statement strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's treacherous betrayal of proletarian internationalism, colluding with the fascist Indonesian reactionary government that is even more brutal than Hitler, to brutally suppress the Indonesian revolutionary people and communists; strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with the U.S. imperialists, the common enemy of the people of the world, to extinguish the flames of resistance against U.S. aggression by the Vietnamese people.

The statement points out that facts have educated us that the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet leadership are indeed not our friends. They are the loyal running dogs of U.S. imperialism and the accomplices of reactionary regimes in various countries.

The statement says that the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leadership towards the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people, and the revolution, that is, the betrayal of proletarian internationalism, is a component of their great betrayal of the world revolution. Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, that is, since Khrushchev's revision of Marxism-Leninism, the policy of splitting the international communist movement, betraying the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world, and surrendering to U.S. imperialism, the Soviet leadership has already placed itself outside the international communist movement. They have made themselves enemies of the people of the world and Marxist-Leninists.

The statement says that one of the leaders of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Brezhnev, on the one hand, hypocritically expresses "support" for Indonesian communists who are being cruelly persecuted by the military dictatorship of the Suharto-Nasution right-wing generals, while on the other hand, colludes with the right-wing generals' regime and expels Indonesian communists from the Soviet Union. Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin provides various forms of assistance to the Indonesian armed forces; the Soviet trade unions and the completely yellow unions serving the Suharto-Nasution right-wing generals' regime have established close relations and cooperation; Soviet journalists and the reactionary Indonesian Journalists Association have established close relations and cooperation. These facts are undeniable by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The statement points out that in opposing the most barbaric acts of terror, the Kosygin government has never stood on the side of the Indonesian people, but instead encourages fascist figures like Nasution, giving him the titles of "patriotic," "pure," and "anti-imperialist"; warmly welcomes Adam Malik to visit the Soviet Union; reduces the burden of the Suharto-Nasution right-wing generals' military dictatorship by reaching an agreement to postpone the repayment of debts; puts pressure on revolutionary Indonesian student movements in the Soviet Union to cancel their programs opposing the Suharto-Nasution right-wing generals' regime; gives great freedom to the activities of reactionary Indonesian student movements in the Soviet Union, and expels me, an Indonesian Communist Party member, from the Soviet Union. Even threatening to deport my family to a country designated by the Soviet authorities. These facts completely expose the shameful traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The statement says that at present, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is intensifying its collusion with U.S. imperialists, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression. To deceive the people of the world, they loudly proclaim some kind of "joint action" to "support" the struggle in Vietnam. However, their so-called "joint action" is essentially a smokescreen to cover up their true collusion with U.S. imperialism to betray the struggle of the Vietnamese people. Recently, the Brezhnev and Kosygin revisionist clique have further intensified their joint actions with U.S. imperialism to serve the "peace talks" conspiracy of their American masters.

The statement says that since the Indonesian reactionary regime launched anti-communist and anti-people terror activities, until the Soviet authorities announced my expulsion, I have been subjected to various pressures from the Soviet leadership in Moscow. However, not even the slightest bit of my red-hearted loyalty to the revolution has been shaken.

The statement says that the arrogant and rude behavior of the Soviet leadership has once again made Indonesian Communist Party members, especially myself, more deeply realize the correctness of the judgments repeatedly made clear by the Chinese Communist Party and the Albanian Party of Labor, that is, the struggle against imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism cannot be separated from the struggle against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership.

In his statement, Suarso warmly praises China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao Zedong, which the Chinese people are currently carrying out, has added a brilliant page to human history that is unprecedented. The great significance and achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only enable the Chinese people to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent revisionists from seizing power, and prevent the restoration of capitalism in China; at the same time, it also promotes the revolutionary movement of the people of the five continents, making China the strongest and invincible bastion in the struggle against imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership.

The statement says that the support given to me by Chinese comrades is the true embodiment of proletarian internationalism in practical actions. I once again express my heartfelt thanks to the great Chinese people, especially to the Chinese Communist Party that holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The statement concludes by saying that no matter what form the Soviet revisionist leadership colludes with the Indonesian reactionary regime, we are firmly convinced that, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely be able to complete the arduous task of defeating the military dictatorship of the right-wing generals Suharto-Nasution, opposing imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism, and achieving the victory of the people's democratic revolution in our country.

    赤胆忠心为革命　横眉怒目斥叛徒  
    印尼留苏学生苏罗梭强烈谴责苏修勾结美帝和印尼反动派
    新华社十日讯　不久前被苏修统治集团无理驱逐出境来到北京的印度尼西亚共产党党员、印度尼西亚人民青年团全国委员会委员、印度尼西亚留苏学生苏阿尔·苏罗梭，最近发表声明，强烈谴责苏共修正主义领导集团卑鄙地背叛无产阶级国际主义，同比希特勒法西斯还要残暴的反共反人民的印度尼西亚反动政权勾结起来，血腥镇压印度尼西亚革命人民和共产党人；强烈谴责苏修领导集团同全世界人民共同的敌人美帝国主义勾结起来，扑灭越南人民反对美国侵略的大规模的反抗烈火。
    声明指出，事实教育了我们，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者，的确不是我们的朋友。他们是美帝国主义忠实的走狗和各国反动政权的帮凶。
    声明说，苏共修正主义领导集团对印度尼西亚共产党、印度尼西亚人民和革命的背叛，即对无产阶级国际主义的背叛，是他们对世界革命伟大事业的大背叛的组成部分。自从苏共二十大以来，即从赫鲁晓夫对马克思列宁主义进行修正，推行分裂国际共产主义运动的政策，背叛全世界人民反帝斗争，并向美帝国主义投降以来，苏共领导集团就已经把自己置于国际共产主义运动之外。他们已使自己成为全世界人民和马克思列宁主义者的敌人。
    声明说，苏共修正主义领导集团头目之一的勃列日涅夫，一方面假惺惺地对遭到苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领军事独裁政权的残酷迫害的印度尼西亚共产党人表示“支援”，而另一方面，却勾结右派将领政权，并把印度尼西亚共产党人从苏联驱逐出去。现在，以勃列日涅夫和柯西金为首的苏共修正主义领导集团，向印度尼西亚武装部队提供了各种形式的援助；苏联工会和完全是为苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派将领政权效劳的黄色工会建立了密切关系和合作；苏联新闻工作者和反动的印度尼西亚新闻工作者协会建立了密切关系和合作。这些事实是苏修领导集团掩盖不了的。
    声明指出，在反对最野蛮的恐怖活动中，柯西金政府的态度从来没有站在印度尼西亚人民一边，而是鼓励纳苏蒂安这样的法西斯人物，并给予他“爱国的”、“纯洁的”、“反帝的”称号；友好地欢迎阿达姆·马利克到苏联访问；以达成延期还清债务的协定来减轻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领军事独裁政权的负担；向留苏的革命的印度尼西亚学生运动施加压力，要他们取消有关反对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派将领政权的纲领；给予留苏的反动的印度尼西亚学生运动的活动极大的自由，而把印度尼西亚共产党员的我，从苏联驱逐出境。甚至威胁要把我一家遣送到苏联当局所指定的某一国家。这些事实，完全暴露了苏修领导集团可耻的叛徒嘴脸。
    声明说，目前，苏修统治集团正在加紧同美帝国主义者勾结，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火。为了欺骗世界人民，他们大吵大嚷要搞什么“联合行动”来“支援”越南的斗争。但是他们叫嚣的“联合行动”，实质上只是一种烟幕弹，以此来掩盖他们真正同美帝国主义搞联合行动以便出卖越南人民的斗争。最近，勃列日涅夫和柯西金修正主义集团更加紧同美帝国主义搞联合行动，以便为美国主子推行“和谈”阴谋效劳。
    声明说，自从印度尼西亚反动政权掀起反共反人民的恐怖活动，直到苏联当局宣布驱逐我出境，我在莫斯科遭到来自苏共领导集团方面的各种压力，但是丝毫也动摇不了我对革命的赤胆忠心。
    声明说，苏共领导集团表现的猖狂无礼，再次使印度尼西亚共产党党员、特别是我自己更深刻地认识到，中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所屡次明确指出的论断的正确性，即反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的斗争是不能同反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争分开。
    苏阿尔·苏罗梭在声明中热情赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，中国人民正在进行的在毛泽东主席亲自领导下的无产阶级文化大革命，为人类历史增添了史无前例的光辉的一页。无产阶级文化大革命的重大意义和战果，不仅使中国人民能够巩固无产阶级专政，防止修正主义者掌权和资本主义在中国复辟；同时也促进了五大洲人民运动的革命化，使中国成为反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争的最坚强和不可战胜的堡垒。
    声明说，中国同志给我的支援，是无产阶级国际主义在实际行动中的真正的体现。我再一次向伟大的中国人民，特别向高举马克思列宁主义旗帜和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的中国共产党表示衷心的感谢。
    声明最后说，不论苏共修正主义领导集团用什么形式同印度尼西亚反动政权进行勾结，我们深信，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来，我们一定能够完成打败陆军右派将领苏哈托—纳苏蒂安的军事独裁，反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，以及使人民民主革命在我国取得胜利的斗争的艰巨任务。
