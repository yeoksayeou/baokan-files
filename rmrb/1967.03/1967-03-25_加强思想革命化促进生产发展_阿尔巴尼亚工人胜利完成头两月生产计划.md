The heroic Albanian working class enthusiastically responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha, striving to achieve further revolutionization, which promoted production and enabled them to successfully complete the production plans for the first two months of this year.

According to materials published by the Planning Department of the Albanian Ministry of Industry and Mines, workers in the fuel industry, who are at the forefront of the mining industry, overfulfilled the oil production plan by 2.2 percent and the coal production plan by 1.4 percent.

Various machine factories, which are directly responsible for supporting spring agricultural production in rural areas, completed and overfulfilled the production plans for various agricultural tools. They also achieved good results in the production of tractor and automobile parts.

Although the weather was poor in the first two months of this year, causing great difficulties for the loggers, they still overfulfilled the plan by 5.5 percent. Workers in the building materials industry also produced more bricks and fiberboards.

Workers in the light industry sector also achieved significant production results. Departments producing cotton fabrics, woolen products, and other items all overfulfilled the production plans for the first two months.
