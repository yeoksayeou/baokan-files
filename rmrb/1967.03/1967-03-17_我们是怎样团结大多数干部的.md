In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our factory's revolutionary faction has always united with revolutionary cadres who dared to stand up and rebel, fighting shoulder to shoulder with them. At the same time, for cadres who made mistakes, we implemented the policy of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," helping and educating them to recognize and correct their mistakes, guiding them back to the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In this way, our factory's revolutionary faction has united the majority of cadres and the majority of the masses, forming a vast army of cultural revolutionaries, achieving great unity, and isolating to the greatest extent the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After seizing power, the revolutionary rebel committee has been vigorously promoting the revolution and production, completing the production tasks ahead of schedule every month, with production significantly increasing compared to the same period last year, and product quality steadily improving, presenting a very good revolutionary situation.

A Severe Test

Last June, our factory's revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, displayed the revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse," launching a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the factory and higher-level leadership organs.

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary parties and comrades will be tested by them and decide whether to abandon or adopt. Stand at the forefront leading them? Or stand behind them criticizing them? Or stand against them opposing them? Every Chinese person has the freedom to choose among these three, but the situation will force you to choose quickly."

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a group of cadres stood up to rebel, leading the way in writing big-character posters, and together with the revolutionary masses, resolutely fought against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This proletarian revolutionary rebel army, composed of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, showed its powerful combat effectiveness from the start, with its spearhead unstoppable, defeating the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

However, there were also some cadres who, in the face of the surging revolutionary mass movement, were frightened and at a loss. Later, they followed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, shouting slogans like "the movement is abnormal," "rightists are attacking the Party," "counter-revolutionary rebellion," and so on, sliding down the reactionary road of the bourgeoisie.

From this, it can be seen that in this sharp and complex class struggle, every cadre faces a severe test.

Uniting Cadres Who Dare to Stand Up

For cadres who dared to stand up, we have consistently adopted a policy of unity, regarding them as an important revolutionary force.

The class enemy fears most the unity of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. When the handful of power-holders within our factory who are taking the capitalist road felt their doom approaching, they distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, plotted conspiracies, shot dark arrows, and used their usurped power to suppress the revolutionary faction in every way possible. Under the support and command of the handful of power-holders within the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road, they fiercely suppressed the revolutionary mass movement, labeling over a hundred revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," "rightists," "traitors," "black gangs," "black lines," and so on. Those revolutionary cadres who supported the masses and led the rebellion were the main targets of their attacks, suffering various political persecutions, and even being forcibly sent back to their hometowns. We revolutionary faction firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the enemy attacks revolutionary cadres, the more we must unite with them; the more the enemy sends revolutionary cadres back to their hometowns, the more we must invite them back. The class enemy, failing in one scheme, devised another, further plotting conspiracies, shooting dark arrows, spreading malicious rumors, and igniting evil fires, saying things like "your organization is impure," "your organization has power-holders," "you are conservative," and so on. However, we have the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which allows us to promptly expose all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks. Chairman Mao said: "Without the enthusiasm of the leading cadres and the enthusiasm of the broad masses combined, it will become the busywork of a few people. But if there is only the enthusiasm of the broad masses without a powerful leading cadre to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be sustained nor be directed correctly and elevated to a higher level." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we withstood the evil winds blown by the class enemy and smashed their conspiracies.

In the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we formed a revolutionary fighting friendship with the revolutionary cadres. We firmly supported them, trusted them, united with them, and fought together with them, seizing power together. These revolutionary cadres also had various shortcomings and mistakes, such as some having too many old frameworks, some lacking revolutionary rebel spirit, and some having various selfish thoughts. We revolutionary faction also criticized and helped them with great enthusiasm and without reservation. The facts have proven that the unity of our revolutionary faction with revolutionary cadres has greatly enhanced the revolutionary strength and ensured the victory of the struggle.

For Cadres Who Made Mistakes, We Look and Help

During the movement, our revolutionary faction firmly grasped the direction of the struggle. The main target of the struggle was always the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, while for those cadres who made mistakes during the movement, we implemented the policy of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient."

Chairman Mao taught us: "We should not only look at a cadre's temporary actions but also at the cadre's entire history and work, which is the main method of identifying cadres." "Anyone who makes mistakes, as long as they do not hide their illnesses and avoid treatment, do not persist in their mistakes to the point of being beyond redemption, but are sincere and truly willing to be treated and corrected, we should welcome them, cure their illnesses, and turn them into good comrades." For cadres who made mistakes, we used the "two-part" perspective to analyze specific issues concretely. Some cadres executed the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and should be criticized. However, many of them were not aware, being both executors and victims of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie; they had aspects of suppressing revolutionary masses and revolution, as well as being deceived and poisoned. We should see both their performance in the Cultural Revolution and their consistent performance in history. Therefore, we adhered to the principle of "neither vague nor harmful to comrades," aiming to achieve both clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades. We strictly criticized their mistakes, touching their souls, helping them raise their consciousness, and completely drawing a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, completely breaking with the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie.

At the same time, we also provided conditions and opportunities for them to correct their mistakes, letting them work and testing them in the struggle. We focused on the "help" aspect, paying attention to their political and ideological work, encouraging them to put down their burdens, remove their worries, bravely examine their mistakes, correct their mistakes, and return to the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, making amends for their past mistakes. This is Chairman Mao's teaching of "look and help." Our approach has deeply moved those cadres who made mistakes, helping them establish the confidence to "rise after falling." Therefore, they actively approached the revolutionary faction organization, examined their mistakes, listened to the criticism of the revolutionary masses, and dared to launch a counterattack against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Correctly handling cadres and strictly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy is a crucial issue for achieving the "three-in-one combination" at present. Starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, we can unite the majority of cadres and the majority of the masses, forming a vast army of cultural revolutionaries, and isolating and striking the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to the greatest extent, achieving the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"The Three Articles" are the iron broom for sweeping away selfish thoughts. We must take up Chairman Mao's iron broom and thoroughly sweep away the "self" in our souls.

Selflessness is the foundation of fearlessness. With "public" at the forefront, one can dare to lead. Only with a public heart can one dare to reveal selfish thoughts, dare to fiercely fight against the "self," and dare to touch the soul.

Against the "self," we must fight a protracted war strategically, making a firm decision to fight it for a lifetime; tactically, we must fight an annihilation battle, using the spirit of "seizing the day" to achieve quick results.

Using a dirty mop to sweep the floor makes the floor dirtier; using selfish thoughts to fight against "self" makes selfish thoughts heavier.

"Change" requires "revealing." "Revealing" not only reveals general problems but especially reveals the deepest and most hidden problems in the soul. After revealing, one must resolutely change.

Fighting against the "self" in one's mind requires continuous battles, fierce attacks, giving the "self" no chance to breathe, and absolutely not "working once and resting forever," nor "combining work and rest."

A proletarian revolutionary must be selfless, everything for the public, and dedicate their life to the public. This public is the public of the people, the public of the proletariat, the public of socialism and communism.

Let "public" be above everything, heavier than everything, higher than everything, greater than everything, and overwhelm everything. Let "public" command every second of life.

    我们是怎样团结大多数干部的
    青岛木器一厂革命造反委员会
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我厂革命派始终团结了敢于站出来造反的革命干部，同他们并肩战斗，同时对犯错误的干部，实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，帮助和教育他们认识错误、改正错误，使他们回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。这样，我厂的革命派就把大多数干部和大多数群众很好地团结起来，形成一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，实现了大联合，最大限度地孤立了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。夺权以后，革命造反委员会狠抓革命，狠促生产，月月超额完成了生产任务，生产比去年同期大幅度增长，产品质量稳定提高，呈现出一片大好的革命形势。
            严峻的考验
    去年六月，我厂革命派和广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命精神，向厂内和上级领导机关中的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起了猛烈攻击。
    毛主席说：“一切革命的党派、革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？每个中国人对于这三项都有选择的自由，不过时局将强迫你迅速地选择罢了。”
    无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动刚开始，就有一批干部起来造反，带头写大字报，同革命群众一道，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了坚决的斗争。这种由革命干部和革命群众相结合的无产阶级革命造反大军，一开始就显示了它的强大的战斗力，矛头所向，锐不可挡，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，打了个人仰马翻。
    但是，也有一些干部，他们是世界观没有改造好的糊涂人，他们在轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动面前，吓得目瞪口呆，不知所措。而后，又跟在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的屁股后面摇旗呐喊，说什么“运动不正常”啦，“右派向党进攻”啦，“反革命暴乱”啦，等等，沿着资产阶级的反动路线滑下去。
    由此可见，在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争面前，每一个干部都面临着严峻的考验。
        团结敢于站出来的革命干部
    对敢于站出来的革命干部，我们自始至终采取了团结的方针，把他们看成是一支重要的革命力量。
    阶级敌人最害怕革命群众和革命干部相结合。我们厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派感到末日到来，大难临头的时候，他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，耍阴谋，放暗箭，利用所窃取的职权，不择手段地向革命派进行反扑。在青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的支持和指挥下，他们疯狂地镇压革命群众运动，一百多名革命群众被打成或者说成是“反革命”、“右派”、“叛徒”、“黑帮”、“黑线”，等等。那些支持群众并带头造反的革命干部，则是他们打击的重点，受到他们种种政治迫害，甚至被强行押送回乡。我们革命派牢记毛主席的教导：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”敌人越是打击革命干部，我们愈是要团结他们；敌人把革命干部押送回乡，我们却偏偏要把他们请回来。阶级敌人一计未成，又生一计，进一步耍阴谋，放暗箭，煽阴风，点邪火，他们胡说什么“你们的组织不纯”，“你们组织里面有当权派”，“你们保皇”，等等。但是，我们有伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就能够及时识破敌人的一切阴谋诡计。毛主席说：“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无广大群众的积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙。但如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”我们遵照毛主席的教导，顶住了阶级敌人刮起的阴风，粉碎了敌人的阴谋。
    在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，我们和革命干部结成了革命的战斗友谊，我们坚决的支持他们，信任他们，团结他们，同他们一起战斗，一起夺权。这些革命干部也有这样那样的缺点、错误，如有的旧框框较多，有的革命造反精神不够强，有的存在种种私心杂念，我们革命派也满怀热情、毫不留情地进行批评帮助。事实证明，我们革命派同革命干部相结合，大大增强了革命力量，保证了斗争的胜利。
      对犯错误的干  部要一看二帮
    在运动中我们革命派紧紧掌握了斗争的大方向。斗争的主要矛头始终对准了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而对那些在运动中犯了错误的干部，则实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针。
    毛主席教导我们：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”“任何犯错误的人，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而是老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。”对犯错误的干部，我们运用“一分为二”观点，对具体问题进行具体分析。有些干部执行资产阶级反动路线，是应当进行批判的。但是，其中有很多人是不自觉的，他们既是资产阶级反动路线的执行者，又是资产阶级反动路线的受害者；他们既有压制革命群众、压制革命的一面，又有受蒙蔽受毒害的一面；我们既要看到他们在文化大革命中的表现，又要看到他们历史上的一贯表现。所以，我们本着“既不含糊敷衍，又不损害同志”，“借以达到既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的。”对他们的错误，思想批判从严，触及他们的灵魂，促使他们提高觉悟，彻底同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限，彻底同资产阶级反动路线决裂。
    同时，我们还注意为他们提供改正错误的条件和机会，让他们去工作，在斗争中考验他们，而且着重在“帮”字上下功夫，注意做他们的政治思想工作，鼓励他们放下包袱，解除顾虑，勇敢地检查错误，改正错误，回到以毛主席为代表的革命路线上来，将功补过。这就是毛主席教导的“一看二帮”。我们的这种做法，使那些犯错误的干部深受感动，使他们树立了“跌倒了爬起来”的信心。因此，他们能够主动地向革命派组织靠拢，检查自己的错误，听取革命群众的批评，并且敢于向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大杀“回马枪”。
    正确地对待干部，不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策，这是当前实现“三结合”的一个重要的问题。从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或斗争，达到团结大多数干部，团结大多数群众，才能组成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，才能最大限度地孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，取得无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    “老三篇”是扫除私心杂念的铁扫帚。我们要拿起毛主席给我们的这把铁扫帚，在灵魂深处大造“私”字的反。
                     ×　×　×
    无私才能无畏。公字当头，才能“敢”字领先。只有一心为公，才敢于亮出私心，敢于狠斗“我”字，敢于触及灵魂。
                     ×　×　×
    对“私”字这个敌人，在战略上要打持久战，下定决心，跟它斗一辈子；在战术上要打歼灭战，要用“只争朝夕”的精神，速战速决。
                 ×　×　×
    用脏拖把拖地板，越拖地板越脏；用私心斗“私”字，越斗私心越重。
                   ×　×　×
    “改”的前提是“亮”。“亮”，不但要亮一般问题，尤其要亮灵魂深处最怕见人的问题。亮出来以后，就要坚决地改。
                   ×××
    与头脑里的“私”字作斗争，要连续作战，猛打猛冲，把“私”字斗得没有一点喘息的机会，决不能“一劳永逸”，更不能“劳逸结合”。
                 ×　×　×
    一个无产阶级革命者，要一心为公，一切为公，一生为公。这个公，就是人民的公，无产阶级的公，社会主义、共产主义的公。
                 ×　×　×
    要让“公”字先于一切，重于一切，高于一切，大于一切，压倒一切。让“公”字统帅生命的每一秒钟。
