The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Zhai Li Brigade in Tong County, Beijing suburbs, have followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production." Through tenacious struggle, they have smashed the fierce counterattack launched by a small clique of cadres who had been removed from power during the "Four Clean-ups" movement and by landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. They have defended the great achievements of the "Four Clean-ups" movement. Through class struggle, they have promoted production struggle and launched a vigorous spring plowing and production campaign.

In October 1964, the "Four Clean-ups" work team arrived at Zhai Li Brigade. The work team, in accordance with the series of policies formulated by Chairman Mao for the Party's "Four Clean-ups" movement in the countryside, organized the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. They took class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, organized a revolutionary class force, overthrew a small clique of cadres within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, exposed the remaining rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries, established a strong leadership core with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone, and established the absolute supremacy of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants truly grasped the power of revolution and production. They were full of vigor and enthusiasm, built a large number of water conservancy projects, increased a large number of production materials, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1965, increasing grain production by more than 800,000 jin. Zhai Li presented a prosperous scene.

However, the small clique of cadres who had been overthrown and were taking the capitalist road, along with the landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, were not willing to admit defeat. They were always waiting for an opportunity to stage a comeback. They colluded with a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the former Beijing Municipal Committee, stirred up trouble, and fiercely launched a counterattack.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, they incited the deceived and misled masses, gathered some social dregs, and came out shouting: "Overturn! Overturn! Power! Power! Overturn the case, and that's power!" They seized the brigade's official seal, paraded revolutionary cadres, and brutally persecuted revolutionary cadres and masses. They played vicious counter-revolutionary economic tricks, using disputes over land boundaries between production teams to propose redistributing land within the brigade, repeatedly inciting mass against mass. Suddenly, a counter-revolutionary tide swept through Zhai Li Street.

Facing the fierce counterattack of the class enemies, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Zhai Li showed their revolutionary spirit and fearless heroism. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It looks as if the reactionaries are formidable, but in reality they are not so powerful." Chairman Mao's teachings gave them endless courage, wisdom, and strength. They united as one, launching a fierce attack on the class enemies. They said: Do you want to overturn the cases of counter-revolutionaries and rich peasants? Never! Do you want to remove their hats? We firmly oppose it! We will still control their labor. Do you want to label us as "counter-revolutionaries"? Impossible!

With the strong support of the "Jinggangshan" classmates from Beijing Normal University, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Zhai Li Brigade used broadcasts, leaflets, big-character posters, connections, and meetings to launch a massive propaganda campaign. They thoroughly exposed the counter-revolutionary plots of the class enemies, revealing their true colors. At a general meeting of all members, they struggled against the ringleaders of the counterattack, legally punished the chief culprits, and with the help of poor and lower-middle peasants from other villages, captured the fleeing criminals. For those who were temporarily deceived and misled, they conducted patient and detailed political and ideological education, using every opportunity to propagate the Party's policies, organizing them to study Chairman Mao's works and relevant documents. The deceived masses quickly awakened, standing with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to fight against the enemies, quickly smashing their plots for a comeback and counter-revolutionary tide.

The victory of the struggle further heightened the class consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants all expressed: We must strive for Chairman Mao, strive for the poor and lower-middle peasants, grasp the revolution, and promote production. If we do well in production, it will be a powerful response to the enemies. During the most intense days of class struggle, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants worked in the fields during the day to promote production and fought against the enemies at night to grasp the revolution. In the early morning, they were the first to get up and go to the fields; when they returned from work, they were the last to come back. All kinds of work were also well arranged, with good results in fertilizer collection, dike and dam repair, and sideline production. To strive for an all-around leap in agricultural production this year, under the leadership of Party branch secretary Deng Qingtian and brigade leader Deng Wantian, who had passed the test of struggle, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses launched a spring plowing and production high tide. Now, the production plans of all production teams have been generally implemented, wheat and large fields have been rolled once; all manure has been removed and transported to the fields; all kinds of tools have been repaired and completed. To welcome the spring irrigation, electricians are busy repairing wires and irrigation equipment. The fields of Zhai Li Brigade are filled with moving scenes everywhere.

Through the intense class struggle, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres deeply felt: Only by grasping the key of class struggle, vigorously promoting the revolution, and fully mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of the members, can production be done better and better. The members excitedly said: "After the 'Four Clean-ups' movement, we achieved two consecutive bumper harvests; after the Cultural Revolution, our spirit is higher, and this year, production will definitely make a greater leap."

    翟里大队贫下中农和革命干部坚决保卫四清运动成果
    不许阶级敌人反攻倒算
    经过斗争考验的广大贫下中农和革命干部团结一致掀起春耕生产热潮
    本报讯　北京郊区通县宋庄公社翟里大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，经过顽强的战斗，粉碎了在“四清”运动中下台的一小撮走资本主义道路的干部和地富反坏分子的猖狂反扑，保卫了“四清”运动的伟大成果。通过阶级斗争，推动了生产斗争，掀起了轰轰烈烈的备耕和春季生产的热潮。
    一九六四年十月，“四清”工作队来到了翟里大队。工作队按照毛主席亲自制订的党在农村进行“四清”运动的一系列方针政策，组织广大群众活学活用毛主席著作，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，依靠贫下中农，组织起革命的阶级队伍，斗倒了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，揪出了漏网的富农分子和反革命分子，建立了以贫下中农为骨干的坚强领导核心，确立了贫下中农的绝对优势，广大贫下中农真正掌握了革命和生产的大权。他们意气风发，干劲十足，兴修了大量的农田水利工程，增加了大量的生产资料，一九六五年获得空前丰收，增产粮食八十多万斤。翟里出现了一派兴旺景象。
    但是，被打倒的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地富反坏分子，他们是不甘心失败的，他们每时每刻都在伺机进行复辟。他们和旧北京市委内的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，互相勾结，狼狈为奸，兴风作浪，疯狂地进行反攻倒算。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，他们煽动被欺骗、被蒙蔽的群众，网罗一些社会渣滓，跳出来大喊大叫：“翻翻翻！权权权！翻了案，就是权！”他们抢夺大队的公章，游斗大队革命干部，残酷打击迫害革命干部和革命群众。他们大肆玩弄反革命经济主义阴谋，利用生产队之间的地边争端，提出要在大队范围内重新平分土地，数次挑起群众斗群众。顿时，一股反革命的逆流，袭击着翟里街。
    面对着阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，翟里的贫下中农和革命干部，充分显示了革命的硬骨头精神和大无畏的英雄气概。他们反复学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”毛主席的教导，给了他们无穷的勇气、智慧和力量。大家团结一致，向阶级敌人猛烈开火。他们说：你要给反革命分子、富农分子翻案吗？妄想！你要给他们摘帽子吗？我们坚决不答应！照样管制他们劳动。要把我们打成“反革命”吗？办不到！
    翟里大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部，在北京师大“井冈山”同学的大力帮助下，利用广播、传单、大字报、串连、开会等形式，展开了声势浩大的宣传工作，充分地揭露阶级敌人的反革命阴谋，使敌人原形毕露。在全体社员大会上，斗争了反攻倒算的头目，依法制裁了首恶分子，在外村贫下中农的协助下，抓住畏罪潜逃的行凶犯。对一时受欺骗、受蒙蔽的一些社员，进行耐心细致的政治思想教育工作，利用一切机会向他们宣传党的政策，组织他们学习毛主席著作和有关文件。受骗的群众迅速觉醒过来，和广大贫下中农、革命干部站在一边，向敌人展开斗争，迅速粉碎了他们的阴谋复辟活动，粉碎了反革命逆流。
    斗争的胜利，进一步提高了广大贫下中农和革命干部的阶级觉悟和生产热情。广大贫下中农纷纷表示：一定为毛主席争气，为贫下中农争气，抓好革命，搞好生产。我们把生产搞好了，就是对敌人的有力回击。在那阶级斗争最激烈的日子里，广大贫下中农白天坚持下地干活，促生产；晚上同敌人斗争，抓革命。清晨，他们最早起床，最先下地；收工时，他们又回来得最晚。各项活路也都安排得很周到，积肥、修堤筑坝和副业生产都搞得很好。为争取今年农业生产的全面跃进，在经过斗争考验的党支部书记邓顷田、大队长邓万田领导下，广大贫下中农和革命群众掀起了春耕生产高潮。现在各生产队的生产计划已普遍落实，小麦和大田已普轧一遍；圈肥已全部起出运到地里；各种农具已修补齐全。为迎接春灌，电工们正忙着检修电线和提灌设备。翟里大队的田野上到处洋溢着动人的景色。
    通过激烈的阶级斗争，广大贫下中农和革命干部深深体会到：只有抓住阶级斗争这条纲，大抓革命，充分调动社员的革命积极性和革命干劲，才能把生产搞得好上加好。社员们兴奋地说：“经过
  ‘四清’运动，我们获得了连续两年的大丰收；经过文化大革命，我们的干劲更高了，今年，生产一定会有更大的跃进。”
