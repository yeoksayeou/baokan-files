A batch of medical personnel from Yunnan and Guangzhou have gone to rural areas to prevent and treat diseases, supporting the spring plowing frontline with practical actions.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, KUNMING, March 11 — A batch of revolutionary medical personnel in Yunnan Province have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." Recently, they carried Mao's works, backpacks, and various medicines and medical equipment to the spring production frontline to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously carry out spring disease prevention and treatment work.

	The medical personnel who went to rural areas for mobile medical services are all revolutionary young pioneers who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They first went to the border minority areas of the five prefectures (autonomous prefectures) of Wenshan, Zhaotong, Lincang, Dehong, and Honghe, where the seasons arrive earlier. Before going down to the countryside, they carefully studied Chairman Mao's "Three Articles," "The Direction of the Youth Movement," "Care for the Masses' Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods," and other brilliant works, as well as relevant documents from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes across the country. They expressed their determination to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on medical and health work facing rural areas, go deep into the fields and homes of poor and lower-middle peasants of minority nationalities, treat and prevent diseases for the masses, learn from the masses, live, eat, and work with the masses, and reform their own thinking.

	After entering the rural areas, these medical personnel, together with revolutionary medical personnel from the prefectures and counties, trained part-time rural health workers, studied Mao's works and the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes across the country with the masses, propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and were warmly welcomed and praised by the commune members.

	According to NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, GUANGZHOU, March 11 — A medical team of 1,300 revolutionary medical workers from the Guangzhou region will go to various rural areas in the province in batches to support spring plowing. The first batch of more than 200 people set out on March 9.

	Revolutionary medical workers from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, as well as graduates from medical colleges and universities, regard going to the countryside to prevent and treat diseases and support spring production as a practical action to carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production." When they heard the higher authorities decide to organize medical teams to go to the countryside, they wrote determination letters and enthusiastically signed up to participate. The medical team from the Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital specially concentrated on studying Mao's works and relevant documents for two days. The medical teams from Sun Yat-sen Medical College and its affiliated hospitals also held reports on the prevention and treatment of diseases, preparing politically, ideologically, and professionally.

    到农村参加巡回医疗的医务人员，都是在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命青年闯将。他们首先到季节较早的文山、昭通、临沧、德宏、红河等五个专区（自治州）的边疆少数民族地区去。下乡前，他们认真学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和《青年运动的方向》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等光辉著作，以及中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信等有关文件。他们表示要坚决执行毛主席提出的医疗卫生要面向农村的指示，深入到田间地头和少数民族的贫下中农家里去，为群众治病防病，并且向群众学习，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，改造自己的思想。
    这些医务人员深入农村后，还与专区、县的革命医务人员一起培训农村不脱产的卫生员，和群众共同学习毛主席著作以及中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信，宣传毛泽东思想，受到社员的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    据新华社广州十一日电　广州地区一千三百名革命医务工作者组成的卫生医疗队，将陆续分批到省内各地农村支援春耕，第一批二百多人已于九日出发。
    广东省、广州市的革命医务工作者，和大、中专医学院校应届毕业生，都把下乡防病治病，支援春耕生产，当作是贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召的实际行动。当他们听到上级决定组织医疗队到农村时，纷纷写决心书，热烈报名参加。广州红十字会医院的下乡医疗队，专门集中学习了两天毛主席著作和有关文件，中山医学院及其附属各医院等单位的下乡医疗队，还分别举行了有关防治疾病的报告会，从政治思想到医疗专业都作了必要的准备。
