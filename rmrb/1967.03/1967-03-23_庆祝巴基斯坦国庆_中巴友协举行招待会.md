The China-Pakistan Friendship Association held a reception to celebrate Pakistan's national day this afternoon. Chinese and Pakistani friends attending the reception warmly wished for the continuous development of friendship between the two peoples.

In his speech, the president of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association, Saifuddin, praised the friendly cooperation between China and Pakistan, which has been continuously developing on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said that U.S. imperialism and various reactionary forces do not like the Sino-Pakistani friendship, and they are trying to sabotage the friendly cooperation between the two countries. This proves that our development of Sino-Pakistani friendship is correct and in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries. The friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan is unbreakable by any force and will continue to be consolidated and developed.

Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan Muhammad Khan and other Pakistani friends in Beijing were invited to attend the reception. The ambassador, in his speech, spoke highly of the long-standing friendly relations between the two peoples and praised the sincere support given by the Chinese people to Pakistan in its struggle to safeguard national independence. He also praised the Chinese people's support for the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. The ambassador said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, following the principle of self-reliance, have achieved great successes in industry, agriculture, and other fields, which is a great encouragement to the Pakistani people.

Those attending the reception included representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, as well as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Hanrong, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission Zhou Yiping, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Economic Commission Yang Lin, and Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Zhang Wenjin.
