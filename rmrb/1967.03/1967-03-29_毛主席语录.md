	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	The Chinese Red Army is a armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not merely about fighting; in addition to fighting to destroy the enemy's military power, it must also undertake major tasks such as propagating among the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses establish revolutionary governments and even Communist Party organizations.

	From "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thinking"

    毛主席语录
    中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。
