At a critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary factions are uniting and waging a decisive battle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the fourth issue of "Red Flag" magazine published the editorial "We Must Correctly Handle the Issue of Cadres." This is a highly important article that shines with the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and it has significant practical implications for guiding the current struggle for power. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party. All levels of leadership must pay full attention to this and never be careless." Whether or not we faithfully implement Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and correctly handle the issue of cadres is a major question of whether the proletarian revolutionary factions correctly implement the revolutionary policy of "three-in-one combination" during their united struggle for power. It is also a key issue for the proletarian revolutionary factions to hold power correctly after seizing it. Therefore, it is an urgent political task for all proletarian revolutionary factions and proletarian revolutionary fighters to resolutely and unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's policies on cadres.

Strictly Distinguish Between Two Types of Contradictions

The revolutionary cadres of the former Organizational Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to expose the problems of leading cadres, to root out the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and to thoroughly smash their counter-revolutionary plots to seize power. This is a victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. However, in the fierce counterattack against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, especially after seizing power, some comrades developed an illusion, believing that "all those in power should step aside." They said, "If we don't completely overthrow them, there won't be many left." Some even said, "First, let them all step aside, then we'll 'clean' them up one by one." Others, while verbally acknowledging that most leading cadres are good, found no good cadres when it came to specific units. Consequently, they adopted an attitude of outright rejection towards the former leading cadres at the level of section chief and above.

Is this understanding and attitude towards leading cadres in line with Mao Zedong Thought? Are all the leading cadres of the former Provincial Party Committee bad? With these questions in mind, we carefully studied Chairman Mao's teachings on distinguishing between enemies and ourselves, and conducted a detailed class analysis of the leading cadres, clarifying whether they are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought elements, or whether they have made general mistakes or serious mistakes; whether they persist in their mistakes and refuse to correct them, or whether they are willing to correct them, and so on. The analysis showed that the handful of capitalist roaders are only a small number, and the majority of leading cadres are good or relatively good. Some cadres have made serious mistakes, but as long as they do not persist in their mistakes and refuse to correct them, and as long as they have not reached the "incurable" stage, we should allow them to correct their mistakes, encourage them to redeem themselves, and absolutely not treat them as enemies. We must resolutely struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders, and resolutely support and fully trust the proletarian cadres in power, unite with them, and fight together. The attitude of doubting, denying, rejecting, and overthrowing all those in power without specific class analysis is anti-Marxism-Leninism, anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and a reflection of anarchist tendencies. This practice of confusing the two types of contradictions will inevitably lead to the suppression of good and relatively good cadres, thereby helping the enemy, isolating ourselves, and causing the proletarian revolutionary factions to lose the support of the majority of the masses. This is extremely dangerous.

However, after the enemy and ourselves have been distinguished, some comrades still adopted an attitude of not fully trusting those cadres who have made general mistakes or serious mistakes. Chairman Mao teaches us, "These comrades' way of looking at problems is wrong. They do not look at the essential and main aspects of the problem, but emphasize the non-essential and non-main aspects." Through repeated study of this passage from Chairman Mao, many Red Guards realized: looking only at the part, not the whole, focusing on the mistakes, and even clinging to non-essential issues, this cannot lead to a realistic evaluation of cadres. Absolute affirmation and absolute negation are both metaphysical.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The work of a person, whether it is three parts achievements and seven parts mistakes, or seven parts achievements and three parts mistakes, must have a fundamental assessment." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we used the method of "analyzing a sparrow" to analyze each leading cadre who made general mistakes or serious mistakes, looking at both their mistakes and their achievements; looking at both the present and the past; looking at both their temporary actions and their consistent performance; looking at both the nature of their mistakes and their performance in correcting them during the movement; looking at both the subjective and objective causes of their mistakes; clarifying whether mistakes and shortcomings are the main aspect, or whether correctness and achievements are the main aspect. There was a section chief whom we once thought had rightist conservatism as his main aspect. After a comprehensive analysis, we felt that this comrade had been working hard and diligently for many years, and during the Cultural Revolution, he actively rose up to oppose the capitalist roaders, enthusiastically supporting the revolutionary factions. This is his main aspect, while conservative thoughts are only a secondary aspect. In this way, through a historical, comprehensive, and essential analysis of each leading cadre, rather than looking at them in isolation, statically, and one-sidedly with a metaphysical viewpoint, we have a basic assessment of each leading cadre.

Resolutely Implement the Policy of "Punishing the Past to Educate the Future and Healing the Sick to Save the People"

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Communist Party members should not adopt an attitude of exclusion towards those who have made mistakes in their work, except for those who are beyond redemption, but should adopt an attitude of persuasion, making them change for the better and start anew." For leading cadres who have made various mistakes, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "punishing the past to educate the future and healing the sick to save the people," doing everything possible to give them the opportunity to reflect on and correct their mistakes, helping them to carry out two revolutions: overthrowing the "self" in their minds and overthrowing the capitalist roaders. To promote their correction of mistakes, we adopted three methods: (1) Organizing them to study Chairman Mao's works. We organized them to study relevant works of Chairman Mao over a period of one week, educating them to use Mao Zedong Thought to deeply touch their souls, break down the "self," and establish the "public," making many leading cadres realize the seriousness and harm of their problems. (2) Mobilizing the masses to do political and ideological work on them, removing their worries, and encouraging them to rebel. We found that some leading cadres had a three-part sequence: at the beginning of the movement, they waited to be struggled against; after being struggled against, they waited to be sent to the countryside for labor; after the publication of the fourth issue of "Red Flag," they waited for the revolutionary factions to invite them to work. In response to this situation, we promptly educated them to correctly handle their own problems, to thoroughly draw a clear line between themselves and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, to draw a clear line between themselves and the bourgeois reactionary line, to resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to stand on the side of the broad revolutionary masses, and to resolutely support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If they refuse the criticism of the masses and adopt a passive or even confrontational attitude, this will only lead to the "incurable" stage. (3) Organizing those leading cadres who have made mistakes but are willing to correct them to make public self-criticisms to the revolutionary masses. At the same time, we proposed four criteria for examining whether they have truly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line: (1) Whether they can actively apply Chairman Mao's works in revolutionary practice, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public"; (2) Whether they dare to fight against the capitalist roaders with actual actions; (3) Whether they support the revolutionary factions with actual actions; (4) Whether they dare to stand up and publicly criticize and admit their mistakes. In this way, many leading cadres felt the direction was clear, actively and voluntarily expressing their attitudes. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Past mistakes must be exposed without mercy, and past bad things must be analyzed and criticized with a scientific attitude, so that future work can be more careful and better." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we followed the policy of "unity-criticism-unity," and in meetings, we exposed and criticized their mistakes face to face without mercy. Many leading cadres sincerely accepted the criticism of the revolutionary masses, further raising their awareness of their mistakes. They generally reflected that this was the trust and care of the revolutionary masses, and they expressed their determination to correct their mistakes and pass the test of socialism. We also invited some of them to participate in the temporary power organs of the "three-in-one combination," giving them appropriate work, fully utilizing their strengths, and fighting shoulder to shoulder with them.

Currently, all the fighters of our Red Guards are repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's statements on cadre policies and the editorials of the third and fourth issues of "Red Flag" magazine. We are determined to study, propagate, implement, and defend Chairman Mao's policies on cadres during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to strengthen the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, and to complete the glorious task of seizing power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

### 不折不扣地按照毛主席的干部政策办事

    不折不扣地按照毛主席的干部政策办事
    黑龙江省委机关红色造反团红炮兵分团
    在无产阶级革命派实行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开夺权斗争的决战时刻，《红旗》杂志第四期发表了《必须正确地对待干部》的社论。这是一篇闪烁着光焰无际的毛泽东思想光辉的极其重要的文章，对指导当前的夺权斗争具有重大的现实意义。毛主席教导我们说：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”是否忠实执行毛主席的干部政策，正确对待干部，是关系到无产阶级革命派在联合夺权中是否正确执行了革命的“三结合”方针的重大问题，也是无产阶级革命派夺权后能否掌好权的关键。因此，坚定不移地、不折不扣地按毛主席的干部政策办事，是摆在一切无产阶级革命派组织和无产阶级革命派战士面前的一个迫切的政治任务。
      严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾
    原黑龙江省委组织部的革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛泽东思想为武器，揭发了领导干部的问题，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底粉碎了他们的反夺权阴谋。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。但是，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的猛烈反击中，特别是在夺权之后，有些同志产生了一种错觉，认为当权派“都得靠边站”。他们说：“不全打倒，也剩不下几个。”也有的说：“先都靠边站，然后一个一个地‘刷’。”还有的口头上承认领导干部大多数是好的，但一落实到具体单位就找不出好干部。因而，对原来处长以上的领导干部抱着一概排斥的态度。
    对领导干部的这种认识和态度是符合毛泽东思想的吗？原省委组织部的领导干部都是坏的吗？我们带着这些问题认真学习了毛主席关于要分清敌我的教导，并对领导干部逐个进行了细致的阶级分析，弄清他们究竟是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的分子，还是只犯了一般的错误或严重的错误；对错误是坚持不改和累教不改，还是愿意改正，等等。分析的结果证明，走资本主义道路的当权派只是一小撮，大多数领导干部是好的或比较好的。一些干部犯了严重的错误，但只要他们对错误不是坚持不改和累教不改，只要没有“达到不可救药的地步”，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪，绝不能把他们当作敌我矛盾来处理。对一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派一定要进行坚决的斗争，而对无产阶级的当权派一定要坚决支持，充分信任，同他们联合起来，共同战斗。那种对当权派不做具体的阶级分析，采取一概怀疑，一概否定，一概排斥，一概打倒的态度是反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的，这是一种无政府主义思潮的反映。这种混淆两类不同性质矛盾的做法，必然导致打击好的和比较好的干部，其结果只能帮助敌人，孤立了自己，使无产阶级革命派丧失大多数群众的拥护，这是极为危险的。
    但是，在敌我问题分清之后，有些同志对犯有一般错误或犯有严重错误的干部，仍然采取了不大信任的态度。毛主席教导我们：“这些同志看问题的方法不对。他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。”通过反复学习毛主席这段语录，许多红色造反者感到：只看局部，不看全体，抓住错误的一面，甚至揪住一些非本质问题不放，这就不能对干部做出实事求是的评价。绝对肯定和绝对否定都是形而上学。
    毛主席教导说：“一个人的工作，究竟是三分成绩七分错误，还是七分成绩三分错误，必须有个根本的估计。”按照毛主席的教导，我们运用一分为二的观点，通过解剖麻雀的方法，对犯有一般错误和犯有严重错误的领导干部逐个进行分析，既看他们的错误，又看他们的成绩；既看现在，又看过去；既看他们的一时一事，又看他们的一贯表现；既看他们所犯错误的性质，又看他们在运动中悔改的表现；既看他们犯错误的主观原因，又看他们犯错误的客观原因；弄清错误和缺点是主流，还是正确和成绩是主流。有一名处长，我们曾经一度认为右倾保守是他的主流，经过全面分析，感到这个同志多年来工作踏实肯干，在文化大革命中他又积极起来造走资本主义道路当权派的反，热情支持革命派，这是他的主流，而保守思想只是他的支流。这样，通过对每个领导干部进行历史的、全面的、本质的分析，而不是孤立地、静止地、片面地用形而上学的观点来看待他们，对每个领导干部就有了基本的估计。
  坚决实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于在工作中犯过错误的人们，除了不可救药者外，不是采取排斥态度，而是采取规劝态度，使之翻然改进，弃旧图新。”对犯这样那样错误的领导干部，我们按照毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”的教导，想尽一切办法给他们以检讨错误、改正错误的机会，帮助他们进行两个革命：革自己头脑中“私”字的命；革走资本主义道路当权派的命。为了促进他们改正错误，我们采取了三种方法：（1）组织他们学习毛主席著作。先后用一周的时间组织他们学习毛主席的有关著作，教育他们用毛泽东思想狠触灵魂，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，使许多领导干部认识到自己问题的严重性和危害性。（2）发动群众向他们做政治思想工作，解除他们的顾虑，鼓励他们起来造反。我们曾发现有些领导干部有这样的三部曲：运动初等着挨斗；斗后等着下乡劳动；《红旗》第四期社论发表后等着革命派请他们出来工作。针对这种情况，我们及时教育他们要正确对待自己的问题，彻底同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界线，同资产阶级反动路线划清界线，坚决站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来，站到广大革命群众一边来，坚决支持无产阶级文化大革命。如果拒绝群众的批评，采取消极以至对抗的态度，那只会导致“达到不可救药的地步”。（3）组织那些犯错误而愿意改正的领导干部向革命群众做公开检查。同时提出四条作为考察他们是否真正站到毛主席革命路线一边的标准：（1）是否能够在革命斗争的实践中活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公；（2）是否敢于用实际行动向走资本主义道路的当权派进行针锋相对的斗争；（3）是否用实际行动支持革命派；（4）是否敢于挺身而出，公开检查承认自己的错误。这样，许多领导干部感到方向明确，积极主动要求表明自己的态度。毛主席教导我们：“对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，要以科学的态度来分析批判过去的坏东西，以便使后来的工作慎重些，做得好些。”根据毛主席的教导，我们本着团结——批评——团结的方针，在会上对他们的错误毫不留情地进行面对面的揭发和批判。许多领导干部虚心诚恳地接受革命群众的批评，进一步提高了对自己错误的认识。他们普遍反映这是革命群众对他们的信任和爱护，纷纷表示要痛下决心改正错误，过好社会主义关。我们还吸收了其中的一部分人参加了“三结合”的临时权力机构，给他们适当的工作，充分发挥他们的作用，和他们一道并肩战斗。
    目前，我们红色造反者的全体战斗员，正在反复地学习毛主席有关干部政策的论述，以及《红旗》杂志第三、四期社论。我们决心在无产阶级文化大革命中努力地学习毛主席的干部政策，热情地宣传毛主席的干部政策，忠实地执行毛主席的干部政策，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的干部政策，为巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合，为胜利完成向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的光荣任务而奋斗。
