The proletarian revolutionary faction of Guizhou Machinery and Electrical Equipment Company, in their struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, strictly followed the cadre policy formulated by Chairman Mao, implementing the principle of combining revolutionary cadres, revolutionary general cadres, and representatives of mass organizations. This formed a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative leadership team with proletarian authority, bringing about a new situation in the company's revolution and production. This fully demonstrated the immense power and boundless vitality of the "three-in-one combination."

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the machinery and electrical equipment company, with the participation of two revolutionary leading cadres, went through a series of struggles to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They formally established the company's temporary power organ—the Revolutionary Production Committee. The committee consists of seven members, including three workers, two deputy managers, and two general cadres. By truly following the teachings of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" principle, the enthusiasm of revolutionary cadres and the masses soared to unprecedented heights, the relationship between leaders and the masses further improved, and the working level of the leadership core significantly increased.

The revolutionary leading cadres selected for the Revolutionary Production Committee were the first to stand out and had always fought side by side with the revolutionary faction. Although they had various shortcomings and errors, after conducting serious self-criticism, the masses forgave them, believed in them, and this greatly educated and motivated them. Their work became more active, proactive, and in-depth, further utilizing their political maturity, strong organizational capabilities, and rich experience in struggle. Soon after seizing power, cadres who made general mistakes and workers deceived by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party had varying degrees of psychological burdens. The revolutionary cadres selected for the Revolutionary Production Committee quickly discovered this issue and believed that resolving it well was a crucial prerequisite for the proletarian revolutionary faction to win over and unite with the majority and wield power properly. They actively and proactively conducted political and ideological work, helping cadres who made general mistakes and deceived workers to draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line and return to the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The Revolutionary Production Committee also held separate symposiums, organizing those who were deceived to study Chairman Mao's works, publicizing Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and timely resolving their ideological issues. One day, it was heard that eight people who went to Beijing to "file a complaint" were returning to the company. Some comrades were prepared to "deal with" them. After discovering this problem, the revolutionary cadres immediately explained the Party's policy, pointing out that the majority of those who went to Beijing to "file a complaint" were deceived. They received education in Beijing, and as long as we further do a good job in ideological work, they can be turned around. Several comrades understood the Party's policy, changed their previous approach, and separately had heart-to-heart talks with those deceived comrades, significantly improving their understanding. Some even immediately exposed the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the company.

Among the members of the Revolutionary Production Committee, the majority are workers and general cadres. They took on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production with an owner's attitude, changing the past phenomenon of leaders giving orders and subordinates executing them. A lively and dynamic scene emerged where everyone researched and worked together. When the Revolutionary Production Committee studied and handled issues, workers, general cadres, and revolutionary leading cadres inspired each other, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, making the issues resolved more timely and reasonably. The repair shop under the company has three machine tools that were allocated last summer. Due to the neglect of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the company, they had not been installed and used for seven or eight months. This time, as soon as the Revolutionary Production Committee was established, everyone proposed to install and use them immediately. The member responsible for production work is the original deputy manager of the company. He fully supported this and actively resolved a series of problems in the installation process. The warehouse under the company needs repair, originally planned to spend 60,000 yuan. Due to the presence of workers and general cadres who understood the situation in the Revolutionary Production Committee, and the revolutionary leading cadres working more deeply than before, after collective research, the expenditure was reduced to just over 30,000 yuan. Many pieces of equipment supporting agriculture had never been operated or processed before. The main reason was that the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the company did not pay attention and found it troublesome, and they did not adopt the opinions raised by the workers. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Production Committee, everyone had a holistic view, facing the new high tide of agricultural production in the province, and strengthened the operation and processing of equipment supporting agriculture. In the past, small electric motors needed in rural areas were not even considered, but now they are being mass-produced and supplied. The valves needed by the fertilizer plant should not be supplied by them according to the material supply channel, but the Revolutionary Production Committee took the initiative to undertake the processing of valves. Through practice, revolutionary workers increasingly deeply felt that the "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Production Committee is an authoritative proletarian power organ that can well implement the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production."

In the process of implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," the machinery and electrical equipment company did not have a smooth sailing. Regarding the issue of whether to combine with revolutionary leading cadres, there was a series of debates and struggles. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, leading cadres underwent one test after another. Who are the proletarian power-holders? Who are the power-holders taking the capitalist road? The revolutionary masses know best. However, at the critical moment of seizing power, especially after establishing the Revolutionary Production Committee, some people in the company put forward various fallacies, saying things like "all leading cadres should step aside," "combining with past power-holders is to protect the emperor," and so on. How to correctly treat revolutionary cadres? The proletarian revolutionary faction in the company, with these questions in mind, further studied Chairman Mao's cadre policy and the five conditions for successors of the revolutionary cause. Chairman Mao taught us, "One must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should one look at a cadre's actions at a particular time, but one should also look at the cadre's entire history and all their work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." Chairman Mao's teachings greatly educated everyone, making them realize that the idea of "seeing a power-holder and beating them, seeing a leading cadre and dragging them away," "opposing everything, excluding everything, and overthrowing everything" is extremely wrong. They used the class analysis perspective to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the company's leading cadres one by one. One deputy manager, although he had shortcomings and errors in the past, supported revolutionary comrades in writing big-character posters to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the former provincial and municipal committees during the Cultural Revolution; during the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, he went deep into the grassroots to fan the revolutionary wind and ignite the revolutionary fire; and finally, he participated in the struggle to seize power with everyone. Everyone said that such a revolutionary leading cadre should be supported, should be supported, and should be united with. Combining with them would strengthen the fighting force of the revolutionary ranks and would not turn the revolutionary ranks into a conservative organization. The proletarian revolutionary faction unified their understanding and propagated to the masses. They saw both the errors and achievements of cadres who made general mistakes, both their actions during the Cultural Revolution and their long-term consistent performance, giving them a comprehensive evaluation and assigning them appropriate work. After resolving these issues, the "three-in-one combination" principle took root among the masses, and the power of the "three-in-one combination" became increasingly great.

    革命领导干部一般干部和群众组织代表三结合
    贵州机电设备公司建立革命的有权威的领导班子
    工人和干部同心协力抓革命促生产到处热气腾腾
    本报讯　贵州省机电设备公司的无产阶级革命派，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权斗争中，不折不扣地遵照毛主席制定的干部政策，实行革命领导干部、革命的一般干部和革命群众组织代表相结合的原则，形成了一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的领导班子，使全公司的革命和生产出现了一片新气象，充分显示了“三结合”的巨大威力和无限生命力。
    机电公司的无产阶级革命派，在公司两个革命领导干部的参加下，经过一系列的斗争，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺了权，并正式建立了公司临时权力机构——革命生产委员会。委员会由七个勤务员组成，其中有三个工人，两个副经理，两个一般干部。由于真正按照毛主席和党中央的教导实行了革命的“三结合”的原则，革命干部和群众的积极性空前高涨，干群关系进一步改善，领导核心的工作水平大大提高。
    选入革命生产委员会的革命领导干部，都是亮相最早而且一直和革命派并肩战斗的。尽管他们有这样那样的缺点、错误，但是他们进行了认真的检讨后，群众谅解他们，相信他们，使他们受到很大的教育和鞭策，工作比过去更积极、主动、深入，进一步发挥了他们政治上比较成熟，组织能力比较强，斗争经验比较丰富的特长。夺权后不久，犯有一般错误的干部和受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派蒙蔽的职工，存在着程度不同的思想包袱。选入革命生产委员会的革命干部，很快发现这个问题，并认为这个问题解决得好，是无产阶级革命派争取和团结大多数，掌好大权的重要前提。于是他们积极主动地做政治思想工作，帮助犯一般错误的干部和受蒙蔽的职工，同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来。革命生产委员会还分别召开座谈会，组织受蒙蔽的人学习毛主席著作，宣传毛主席的干部政策，及时地解决了他们的思想问题。一天，听说八个上北京“告状”的人要回公司，有的同志准备“整”他们一下。革命干部发现这个问题以后，就马上交代党的政策，指出上北京“告状”的人绝大多数是受蒙蔽的，他们到北京受了教育，只要我们进一步做好思想工作，是可以使他们转变的。几个同志懂得了党的政策，改变了原来的作法，分别找那几个受蒙蔽的同志谈心，使他们的认识有了很大的提高，有的人甚至当即揭发了公司内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。
    在革命生产委员会的成员中，多数是工人和一般干部，他们以主人翁的姿态挑起革命和生产两副重担，改变了过去那种领导动口，下面动手的现象，出现了大家研究一起动手的生动活泼的局面。革命生产委员会在研究、处理问题时，工人、一般干部和革命的领导干部，互相启发，取长补短，使问题解决得更加及时、合理。公司所属维修厂，有三台机床，是去年夏天调拨来的。由于公司内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不重视，七、八个月来一直没有安装使用。这次，革命生产委员会一成立，大家便提出要立即安装使用。负责生产工作的勤务员是原公司的副经理，他全力支持，并积极地解决了安装中的一系列问题。公司所属仓库需要检修，原计划花六万元，由于革命生产委员会中有比较了解情况的工人和一般干部，加上革命领导干部工作比过去深入了，经过集体研究，把用费削减到三万多元就够了。许多支援农业的设备，过去都没有经营和加工过。主要原因是公司那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不重视，嫌麻烦，职工提出意见也不采纳。革命生产委员会成立以后，大家胸怀全局，面对全省出现的农业生产新高潮，加强了支援农业的设备的经营和加工。农村需要小型电动机，过去压根儿没有放在心上，现在大力加工供应了。化肥厂急需的管道阀门，按物资供应渠道，根本不该由他们供应，可是革命生产委员会却主动地挑起了加工阀门的重担。通过实践，革命职工们越来越深刻地体会到，“三结合”的革命生产委员会，是权威的无产阶级权力机构，是能够很好地贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召的组织形式。
    机电设备公司在实行革命的“三结合”的过程中，不是一帆风顺的。对于要不要和革命领导干部结合的问题，是经历了一系列的辩论、斗争的。在这场史无前例的文化大革命中，领导干部经受了一场又一场斗争的考验。谁是无产阶级当权派？谁是走资本主义道路当权派？革命群众最了解。但是，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，特别是在夺权以后成立革命生产委员会的时候，公司里一部分人发出了种种怪论，说什么“凡是领导干部都要靠边站”，“和过去的当权派结合就是保皇”等等。到底怎样正确对待革命干部？公司里的无产阶级革命派带着这些问题，进一步学习毛主席的干部政策和革命事业接班人的五项条件。毛主席教导我们说，“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”毛主席的教导使大家受到很大的教育，认识到“见当权派就打，见领导干部就揪”，“反对一切、排斥一切、打倒一切”的思想，是极端错误的。他们用阶级分析的观点，对公司的领导干部逐一进行了全面的分析。有一个副经理，过去虽然有缺点错误，但是在文化大革命运动中，他支持革命同志写大字报批判前省、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；在批判资产阶级反动路线时，还深入基层煽革命之风，点革命之火；最后又和大家一起参加夺权斗争。大家说，象这样的革命领导干部，我们应该拥护，应该支持，应该联合，和他们结合在一起，就会增强革命队伍的战斗力，决不会使革命队伍变成保守派组织。无产阶级革命派内部统一了认识，就向群众进行宣传。他们对犯有一般错误的干部，既看到他们的错误，也看到他们的成绩，既看到他们在文化大革命中的行动，也看到他们长期一贯的表现，给以全面的评价，给他们适当的工作。在解决这些问题后，“三结合”的原则就在群众中扎下根来，“三结合”的威力也就越来越大。
