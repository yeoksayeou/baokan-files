The poor and lower-middle peasants revolutionary faction of Hongguang Brigade in Banqiao Commune, Baoshan County, Yunnan Province, support revolutionary cadres to take on heavy responsibilities and lead spring plowing production with confidence.

Since the Cultural Revolution began, the poor and lower-middle peasants revolutionary faction of Hongguang Brigade have given cadres many suggestions. At the same time, they follow Chairman Mao's teachings, conduct class analysis of cadres, and treat them differently. They say, revolutionary cadres are the party and the people's wealth, and are an important force in carrying out all work. We must support them, help them, and do a good job. Even for cadres who have made mistakes, we must follow Chairman Mao's consistent teachings of "punishing past mistakes and curing the sickness to save the patient," patiently helping them correct their mistakes and encouraging them to move forward. As long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements who insist on not changing and are incorrigible, they should be allowed to make amends for their mistakes. Only in this way can we unite all forces that can be united and thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

The brigade party branch secretary, Zhao Guozhu, was elected after the "Four Clean-ups." At first, he did not understand the Cultural Revolution and, after being posted with a few big-character posters, he could not accept it. The poor and lower-middle peasants revolutionary faction patiently enlightened and helped him, studying Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points" with him. Zhao Guozhu studied Chairman Mao's words: "We Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." He deeply felt that to make fewer or no mistakes, one must experience the storm of the masses' struggle, see the world of the masses' struggle, and accept the masses' supervision. After that, he actively checked his shortcomings and mistakes on one hand, and stood with the revolutionary masses on the other, engaging in uncompromising struggle with the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support the revolutionary actions of revolutionary cadres and actively help and urge them to lead spring plowing production. This year, all six production teams in the brigade decided to promote effective rice varieties, but only planned and did not implement. The poor and lower-middle peasants urged Zhao Guozhu to check and implement, promoting each team to select and replace good seeds. In the past two years, each production team has planted many mulberry trees, but the mulberry gardens are not continuous and are not easy to manage. Revolutionary cadres, with the active support of the poor and lower-middle peasants, took measures to transplant more than ten thousand mulberry seedlings, making the mulberry gardens of each team continuous.

The poor and lower-middle peasants' practice of uniting and supporting revolutionary grassroots cadres has been attacked and slandered by a few people with ulterior motives, saying it is "compromise" and "conciliation." The poor and lower-middle peasants revolutionary faction saw through the enemy's tricks and said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." They still firmly support revolutionary cadres.

### 红光大队贫下中农正确对待干部  支持革命干部挺起腰杆领导春耕

    红光大队贫下中农正确对待干部
    支持革命干部挺起腰杆领导春耕
    新华社昆明二十六日电　云南省保山县板桥公社红光大队的贫下中农革命派，支持革命干部挺起腰杆挑重担，领导好春耕生产。
    文化大革命开展以来，红光大队贫下中农革命派给干部提了许多意见。同时，他们遵照毛主席的教导，对干部作阶级分析，区别对待。他们说，革命的干部是党和人民的财富，是搞好各项工作的重要力量。对革命的干部，我们要拥护他们，支持他们，帮助他们把工作做好。就是对犯过错误的干部，我们也要遵照毛主席一贯教导的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，耐心地帮助他们改正错误，鼓励他们前进。只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，都要允许他们将功补过。只有这样，才能团结一切可以团结的力量，彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。大队党支部书记赵国珠是“四清”后才当选的。开始，他对文化大革命很不理解，被贴了几张大字报，就想不通。贫下中农革命派耐心地启发、帮助他，和他一起学习毛主席著作和“十六条”等文件。赵国珠学习了毛主席语录：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”他深深感到要使自己少犯和不犯错误，就得经群众斗争的风雨，见群众斗争的世面，接受群众的监督。这以后，他一面主动检查自己的缺点和错误，一面和革命群众站在一起，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子进行不调和斗争。
    贫下中农坚决支持革命干部的革命行动，并主动帮助和督促他们领导好春耕生产。今年全大队六个生产队都决定推广行之有效的水稻优良品种，但只订了计划，没有落实。贫下中农便督促赵国珠检查落实，推动各队都选换了良种。近两年来，各生产队都种植了许多桑树，但桑园没有成片，不好管理。革命干部在贫下中农积极支持下采取措施，移植了一万多株桑苗，使各队桑园连成一片。
    贫下中农团结、支持革命的基层干部的做法，曾受到少数别有用心的人的攻击，污蔑说这是“妥协”，“调和”。贫下中农革命派识破了敌人的阴谋诡计，他们说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”仍然坚定地支持革命干部。
