	On Cadres, Specific Analysis Is Required
	Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, *Beijing Dongfanghong* Newspaper Commentator

	How to use class analysis to correctly view cadres at all levels and fully utilize the role of revolutionary cadres in the struggle for power is an important issue that we revolutionaries need to seriously consider and resolve.

	Some people say: "None of the cadres in our institute are good; they all have problems." These people view things too simplistically. Chairman Mao says: "Many of our comrades lack analytical minds. They do not want to conduct repeated, in-depth analysis and research on complex matters but prefer to draw absolute affirmative or negative conclusions. ... In the future, we should improve this situation." We should see that the capitalist-roaders in power within the party are only a small handful, and the majority of cadres are good or relatively good. Among them, some have made various mistakes, but they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements; they are still willing to revolutionize and support the party and Chairman Mao. For these cadres, we must unswervingly adopt the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "unity-criticism-unity." Even those who have made serious mistakes, as long as they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements and are not stubborn and incorrigible, we should allow them to reform and encourage them to redeem themselves. Not understanding this, and indiscriminately and without distinction viewing all cadres as the same, believing that anyone with a "leadership" title cannot be trusted and should all be set aside, is completely wrong. This idea and practice of not distinguishing between right and wrong, rejecting everything, opposing everything, and overthrowing everything is contrary to Mao Zedong Thought.

	"All the cadres in our institute are spineless; none have truly stood up yet." Some people talk like this. Indeed, many cadres, although they are willing to revolutionize, have made big and small mistakes, and thus carry heavy burdens, putting themselves in a passive position of being criticized and waiting for the organization and the masses to review them, waiting to be "liberated," and not daring to take the initiative to revolutionize. For these cadres, on the one hand, we must deeply expose and seriously criticize the mistakes they have made, and through criticism or struggle, help them quickly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; on the other hand, we must actively and patiently work on them, remove their mental obstacles, and encourage them to bravely stand up, oppose the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, redeem their past mistakes, discard the old and seek the new, and contribute to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, rather than passively waiting for them to stand up on their own. This is the correct attitude we revolutionaries should hold.

	"We must not forget to draw these two lines when looking at problems: the line between revolution and counter-revolution, and the line between achievements and shortcomings. ... Of course, to draw the lines correctly, we must conduct careful research and analysis. We should adopt an attitude of analysis and research towards every person and every matter." When conducting specific analysis of the cadres at all levels in our institute, we should act according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

	After nine months of a massive revolutionary mass movement, we have basically distinguished between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, and counter-revolutionary cadres. At the decisive moment of the united seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary cadres and cadres who have made mistakes should clearly express their stance and stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	The proletarian revolutionaries must act according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy. However, we must also be vigilant against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party who attempt to take advantage of the chaos, reverse the verdict, negate the direction of the revolutionaries, and engage in class revenge. For those who have consistently been anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, we must thoroughly overthrow them and implement proletarian dictatorship!

	The role of revolutionary cadres in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs must be fully estimated. Only in this way can the revolutionaries truly seize power and hold it well.

    对干部要作具体分析
    北京邮电学院  《北邮东方红》报评论员
    如何用阶级分析的方法，正确地看待各级干部，充分发挥革命干部在夺权斗争中的作用，这是需要我们革命派认真思考和解决的重要问题。
    有些人认为：“咱们学院的干部没有一个好的，都有问题。”这些人把事情看得过于简单了。毛主席说：“我们许多同志缺乏分析的头脑，对于复杂事物，不愿作反复深入的分析研究，而爱作绝对肯定或绝对否定的简单结论。……今后应该改善这种状况。”应当看到，党内走资本主义道路的当权派，只是一小撮，大多数干部是好的和比较好的。其中有些人犯了这样那样的错误，但还不是反党反社会主义分子，他们还是愿意革命的，是拥护党、拥护毛主席的。对于这些干部，我们应当毫不动摇地采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”和“团结——批评——团结”的方针。就是犯了很严重错误的干部，只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，也要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。不了解这一点，笼统地、不加区别地把所有的干部都看成一个样，认为凡是“长”字号的就一概不能信，统统都要靠边站，这是完全错误的。这种不分青红皂白，排斥一切、反对一切、打倒一切的想法和作法，是违背毛泽东思想的。
    “咱们学院的干部都窝囊，到现在还没有一个真正站出来的。”有些人这样议论着。确实，有许多干部，尽管他们是愿意革命的，但是由于犯有大大小小的错误，就背上了沉重的包袱，把自己放在被动挨整的地位，等待组织和群众的审查，等待“解放”，而不敢主动起来革命。对于这些干部，我们一方面要深入揭发、严肃批判他们所犯的错误，通过批评或斗争，使他们更快地站到毛主席的革命路线一边来；另一方面，要主动地耐心地对他们做工作，解除他们的思想顾虑，鼓励他们勇敢地站出来，造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，将功补过，弃旧图新，为无产阶级文化大革命贡献力量，而不应消极地等待他们自己站出来。这是我们革命派应持的正确态度。
    “我们看问题一定不要忘记划清这两种界限：革命和反革命的界限，成绩和缺点的界限。……自然，要把界限划好，必须经过细致的研究和分析。我们对于每一个人和每一件事，都应该采取分析研究的态度。”在对我院各级干部进行具体分析的时候，我们应当切实按照毛主席的这一教导办事。
    经过九个月来声势浩大的革命群众运动，已经基本上把革命的、不革命的和反革命的干部区分开来了。在无产阶级革命派联合夺权的决战时刻，革命干部和犯有错误的干部，应当鲜明地表示自己的态度，站到毛主席的革命路线一边。
    无产阶级革命派必须按照毛主席的干部政策办事。但是，也必须警惕一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派企图混水摸鱼，趁机翻案，否定革命派的大方向，进行阶级报复的阴谋勾当。对于一贯反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，我们就是要彻底打倒，对他们实行无产阶级专政！
    革命干部参加“三结合”临时权力机构的作用，必须充分估计。只有这样，革命派才能真正把权夺过来，把权掌好。
