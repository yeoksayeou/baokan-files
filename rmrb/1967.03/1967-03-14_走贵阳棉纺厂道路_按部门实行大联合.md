Many industrial and mining enterprises in Guiyang have already unified from the bottom up by administrative departments. They believe that this unification fully meets the needs of the current revolutionary struggle, is more conducive to the thought revolution of the revolutionary masses, and is more conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, March 13th: Many industrial and mining enterprises in the Guiyang region have seriously studied the experience of the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Guiyang Cotton Mill. They have unified from the bottom up by administrative departments. They follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "organizational tasks must be subordinate to political tasks." They are determined to follow the path of the Guiyang Cotton Mill in the current struggle, to unify the proletarian revolutionary masses from the bottom up by departments into a unified revolutionary organization, and to win the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

The revolutionary workers of the Guiyang Steel Plant have seriously studied the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill and the editorial of the People's Daily, "A Good Form of Great Unification of the Proletarian Revolutionary Masses." The revolutionary masses of the Mechanical Power Department's Machine Shop sent more than 20 representatives to the Guiyang Cotton Mill to "learn from them," and combined with actual conditions to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works, unifying their thoughts. They said, using Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of the great unification, unifying from the bottom up by administrative departments, this fully meets the needs of the current revolutionary struggle, is more conducive to the thought revolution of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and is more conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Now, units such as the Rolling Mill and the Mechanical Power Department's Machine Shop have already unified by administrative departments.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Second Railway Engineering Bureau's Factory 102 of the Ministry of Railways in Guiyang have learned from the experience of the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Guiyang Cotton Mill. On March 3rd, the largest revolutionary mass organization in this factory—the Defenders of Mao Zedong Thought Railway Rebel Corps 102 Main Force Team—posted a big-character poster announcing the dissolution of this organization. They also suggested unifying from the bottom up by workshops, teams, and sections, and then establishing a unified revolutionary mass organization for the entire factory. Revolutionary workers responded enthusiastically, gradually withdrew from cross-industry and cross-sector teams and squads, and unified by workshops, teams, and sections. On March 10th, they established a unified revolutionary organization for the entire factory—the Mao Zedong Thought 102 Factory "January 23" Corps.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Guizhou Red Star Tractor Factory, while studying the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill's unification by administrative departments and the editorial of the People's Daily, combined their own actual situation and conducted a rectification campaign. The factory's Learning and Working Combat Team dared to charge and fight during the cultural revolution, earning the praise of the masses. However, when the factory began to unify by workshops, they had difficulties understanding, feeling that they were at a disadvantage and that their previous efforts were in vain, and were unwilling to disband their original organization. During the rectification, they criticized the emerging tendencies of sectarianism and small-groupism, achieving unification by workshops. In the process of great unification, the proletarian revolutionary masses of this factory, like those of the Guiyang Cotton Mill, paid great attention to uniting the broad masses of workers, enthusiastically helping those who had been deceived to join the "protection" organizations to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary fighters of the Forging and Pressing Workshop took the initiative to study Chairman Mao's quotations with the deceived workers before work; they found various opportunities to talk with them; they listened patiently to their opinions when arranging production tasks; and they promptly praised them when they achieved results. Under the patient help of the revolutionary fighters, many deceived workers awakened and stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Now, the workshops of this factory have achieved great unification by administrative departments, and production has significantly increased.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory seized power on January 19th but were counter-seized by the "protection" organizations because the revolutionary masses had not achieved great unification and the "three-in-one combination," and had not united the broad masses of workers. Later, they seized power again. They learned from the experience of the great unification of the Guiyang Cotton Mill and have already unified by administrative departments. To unite the majority of the masses and cadres, the proletarian revolutionary masses of this factory, on the one hand, through talking with the deceived, exposed the crimes of the "protection" organizations that manufactured the counter-seizure, helping the deceived class brothers to quickly awaken and return to the revolutionary line; on the other hand, while thoroughly criticizing the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, they organized cadres who had made mistakes to study the "Three Old Articles" and the editorial of the Red Flag magazine, as well as the "Letter to the People of the Entire Province" of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, striving to unite the majority of cadres to stand up and make revolution. Currently, the factory is forming a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership core through a Paris Commune-style election, and is quickly establishing a revolutionary committee for the entire factory.

To accelerate the achievement of great unification from the bottom up by administrative departments in the Guiyang region, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee is vigorously promoting the good experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill through report meetings, organized visits, and other means. The headquarters of the Mao Zedong Thought Guizhou Red Worker Combat Team and the Mao Zedong Thought Guiyang Combat Team, with workers as the main body, have been successively dissolved. After the headquarters were dissolved, except for a few people temporarily left to work in the preparatory group established to promote unification by unit and industry, the rest all returned to their original units and unified with the revolutionary masses of their units, industries, and systems to "grasp revolution, promote production," and complete the fighting tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units.

    走贵阳棉纺厂道路　按部门实行大联合
    贵阳许多工矿企业的革命派已经自下而上地按行政部门联合起来。他们认为，这种联合完全适应当前革命斗争形势的需要，更有利于革命派的思想革命化，更有利于贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针
    新华社贵阳十三日电　贵阳地区许多工矿企业的无产阶级革命派，认真学习贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派的经验，自下而上地按行政部门实行大联合。他们按照毛主席“组织任务须服从于政治任务”的教导，决心在当前的斗争形势下，走贵阳棉纺厂的道路，自下而上地按部门把无产阶级革命派组织在统一的革命组织中，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    贵阳钢铁厂革命职工认真学习了贵阳棉纺厂的经验和《人民日报》社论《无产阶级革命派大联合的好形式》。机械动力室金工工段的革命派还派出二十多名代表到贵阳棉纺厂去“取经”，并结合实际反复学习了毛主席著作，统一思想。他们说，用毛泽东思想作为大联合的灵魂，自下而上地按行政部门联合起来，这完全适应当前革命斗争形势的需要，更有利于无产阶级革命派的思想革命化，更有利于贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。现在，轧钢车间和机械动力室金工工段等单位，已经按行政部门联合起来了。
    在贵阳的铁道部第二铁路工程局一零二厂无产阶级革命派，学习了贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派的经验。三月三日，这个厂最大的革命群众组织——捍卫毛泽东思想铁路造反兵团一零二主力团贴出大字报宣布撤销这一组织，并且建议自下而上地按车间、班组、股室搞大联合，然后成立全厂统一的革命群众组织。革命职工纷纷响应，陆续退出了跨行跨业的团、队，按车间、班组和股室实行大联合，并于三月十日成立了全厂统一的革命组织——毛泽东思想一零二厂“一·二三”兵团。
    贵州红星拖拉机厂的无产阶级革命派，在学习贵阳棉纺厂按行政部门搞大联合的经验和《人民日报》社论时，结合自己的实际情况，进行了整风。这个厂的学工战斗队，在文化大革命中敢冲敢闯，受到群众的赞扬。但是，厂里开始按车间搞大联合的时候，他们思想不通，感到“吃亏”，是“前功尽弃”，不愿拆散原来组织。整风中，他们批判了开始露头的风头主义、小团体主义等错误思想倾向，实现了按车间的大联合。在进行大联合中，这个厂的无产阶级革命派也象贵阳棉纺厂一样，很重视团结广大职工，热情帮助受蒙蔽参加了“保”字号组织的阶级弟兄回到毛主席的革命路线上来。锻压车间的革命派战士，在上班前主动地和受蒙蔽的工人一起学习毛主席语录；找各种机会和他们谈心；安排生产任务时，耐心地听取他们的意见；他们做出了成绩，及时给予表扬。在革命派战士的耐心帮助下，许多受蒙蔽的工人觉悟过来，纷纷站到毛主席的革命路线一边来。现在这个厂的各个车间已经实现了按行政部门的大联合，生产显著上升。
    贵州柴油机厂的无产阶级革命派一月十九日夺权以后，曾被“保”字号组织反夺权，原因是革命派没有搞好大联合和“三结合”，没有团结好广大职工。后来，他们又夺回了大权。他们学习了贵阳棉纺厂的革命大联合的经验，已经按行政部门联合起来。为了团结大多数群众和干部，这个厂的无产阶级革命派一方面通过同受蒙蔽的人谈心；并揭发制造反夺权的保字号组织的罪恶，帮助受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄迅速觉醒，回到革命路线上来；另方面，无产阶级革命派在彻底批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的同时，组织犯过错误的干部学习“老三篇”和《红旗》杂志社论，以及贵州省革命委员会《告全省人民书》等，争取团结大多数干部挺起腰杆闹革命。目前，这个厂正在通过巴黎公社式的选举，组成革命的“三结合”的领导核心，尽快地成立全厂的革命委员会。
    为了加速实现贵阳地区自下而上地按行政部门的大联合，贵州省革命委员会正在通过报告会、组织参观访问等方式，大力推广贵阳棉纺厂的好经验。以工人为主体的毛泽东思想贵州省红色工人战斗团、毛泽东思想贵阳战斗团等总部，已经陆续撤销。总部撤销后，除暂留在为促进按单位、按行业实行大联合而建立的筹备组工作的少数人员外，其余一律回原单位，同本单位、本行业、本系统的革命派联合起来，“抓革命，促生产”，完成本单位斗、批、改的战斗任务。
