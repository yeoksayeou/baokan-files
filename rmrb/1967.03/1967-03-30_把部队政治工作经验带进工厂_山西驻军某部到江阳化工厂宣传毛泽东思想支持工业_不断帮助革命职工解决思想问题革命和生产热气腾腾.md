The soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanxi have brought the effective political work experience of the army into the Jiangyang Chemical Factory in Taiyuan City. This has enabled the revolutionary workers of the factory to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously use Mao Zedong Thought to solve real-life ideological problems, and present a lively scene of both revolution and production.

After the revolutionary rebels of the Jiangyang Chemical Factory, through arduous struggles, seized the leadership from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, some workers became complacent, thinking that seizing power meant "everything is settled." Others opposed revolution and production, believing that focusing on revolution would affect production. The soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, who came to the factory to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and support industrial production, followed Chairman Mao's teachings. As soon as they entered the factory, they ate and worked with the revolutionary workers, conducted investigations, understood the situation, grasped the ideological trends, and promptly helped solve the problems.

When they discovered the aforementioned ideological issues among some members of the revolutionary mass organizations, they used Chairman Mao's directive on "grasping revolution and promoting production" to analyze and compare, believing that if these views were not quickly resolved, Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production" could not be thoroughly implemented. Therefore, they studied Chairman Mao's directive on "grasping revolution and promoting production" and relevant editorials from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily" with the revolutionary workers. After the study, the revolutionary workers expressed: We must stand in the workshop with the country in our hearts and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasping revolution and promoting production." We must both carry out the Cultural Revolution and production well, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

After seizing power, the factory, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, established two leadership teams for revolution and production. Initially, the coordination between the two teams was not good, and there were some conflicts in the arrangement of time and manpower. The army cadres who came to the factory organized everyone to study "The Working Method of the Party Committee," discussing and researching how to solve the problems existing in the leadership of revolution and production. They immediately decided to insist on an eight-hour production time, placing the movement in the spare time after work; reducing the number of full-time personnel in each workshop from four to five to one or two, generally participating in production; and establishing a unified command organization in the workshop to promptly solve various problems arising in revolution and production.

After both revolution and production presented a lively scene, the soldiers, together with the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the factory, focused on the weak links. The second workshop had low production and poor quality. The soldiers went to this workshop and worked with the workers, had heart-to-heart talks, and found that some comrades in the proletarian revolutionary faction could not correctly treat the deceived masses; some who had made mistakes also felt they could not hold their heads up, and their production enthusiasm was not high. Based on the army's political work experience, they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and the article "How We Won and United the Majority of the Masses" written by the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Beijing Stamp Factory, helping the proletarian revolutionary faction correctly treat the deceived masses. The young revolutionaries, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "not only uniting with those who agree with us but also being good at uniting with those who disagree with us, and even those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice," said: The masses were deceived by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we cannot discriminate against them, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, and unite with them to fight together. At the same time, the soldiers also educated the deceived masses to raise their class consciousness, distinguish right from wrong, and firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. On the basis of jointly raising awareness, the soldiers organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. ... All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." The revolutionary masses of the entire workshop united and worked together to solve production problems, improving production efficiency.

The factory had many revolutionary mass organizations, which were no longer suitable for the current new combat tasks. When the experience of Guiyang Cotton Mill in uniting according to administrative departments came, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the factory and many revolutionary mass organizations all agreed. However, when studying how to unite, disagreements arose. A member of a revolutionary organization said: "Our organization was established earlier, and after the union, we should take the lead." Another revolutionary organization member believed that their merits were great, and after the union, their organization should take the lead. At this time, the soldiers organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles" and the brilliant works "On Correcting Errors in the Party," making everyone realize that personal ambition, sectarianism, liberalism, and localism are stumbling blocks on the path of the proletarian cultural revolution. If these things are not overcome, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line cannot be implemented, and revolutionary victory cannot be achieved. They broke private interests and firmly fought against the "self" in their minds, uniting according to administrative units.

With the deepening of political and ideological work, the broad revolutionary workers quickly turned the revolutionary enthusiasm released by the proletarian cultural revolution into production. The lathe worker Jiang Zhengxiu in the seventh workshop, with the help of revolutionary workers throughout the workshop, successfully developed a new type of turbine processing tool. Previously, one tool could only process one type of turbine, but now one tool can process various turbines. Processing each turbine saves more than 100 yuan and takes more than a month less time than before. The worker Liu Wu in the third group, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "thrift for revolution," determined to reform the operating method. He found discarded iron pipes and successfully developed an automatic dust remover in his spare time, saving 12 kilograms of alcohol and 5-6 kilograms of cotton yarn per day. The revolutionary workers in the machine repair team also demonstrated the spirit of not fearing fatigue and continuous fighting. When the third machine malfunctioned, they repaired it overnight, ensuring that the machine started on time the next day.

Currently, the revolutionary workers and cadres of the factory are further rallying their spirits, striving to excel, making the revolution fiery and production excellent. In February, they completed the production plan ahead of schedule, and since entering March, the production plan has also been completed excellently.

    把部队政治工作经验带进工厂
    山西驻军某部到江阳化工厂宣传毛泽东思想支持工业
    不断帮助革命职工解决思想问题革命和生产热气腾腾
    据新华社太原二十九日电　人民解放军驻山西某部指战员，把部队行之有效的政治工作经验带到太原市江阳化工厂，使这个工厂的革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断用毛泽东思想解决现实思想问题，革命和生产都呈现一派热气腾腾的景象。
    江阳化工厂无产阶级革命派，经过艰苦斗争，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回领导权以后，有的产生松懈情绪，认为夺了权就“万事大吉”了；也有的把革命和生产对立起来，认为抓革命就要影响生产。到这个工厂宣传毛泽东思想，支持工业生产工作的解放军某部指战员，按照毛主席的教导，一进厂就同革命职工同吃、同劳动，调查研究，摸清情况，抓住思想苗头，及时帮助解决问题。当他们发现革命群众组织中一些成员的上述活思想以后，就用毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示分析对照，认为这些看法如果不尽快地解决，毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针就不能彻底贯彻。于是，他们就同革命职工一起，反复学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》有关社论。经过学习，革命职工表示：我们一定要站在车间，胸怀祖国，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，既要搞好文化大革命，也要搞好生产，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    这个厂夺权后，在革命造反总指挥部领导下，建立了领导革命、生产的两个班子。起初，两个班子协调得不够好，在时间、人力安排上有些矛盾。到厂的解放军干部就组织大家学习《党委会的工作方法》，边讨论边研究如何解决领导革命和生产中存在的问题。当即决定一定要坚持八小时生产时间，把运动放到下班后的业余时间；各车间脱产人员由四至五人，减少到一至二人，一般情况下都参加生产；并在车间成立统一的指挥机构，及时解决革命和生产中发生的各种问题。
    当革命和生产都出现热气腾腾局面以后，指战员们又会同工厂革命造反总指挥部抓薄弱环节。二车间产量低，质量也差。指战员们来到这个车间和工人们一起劳动，一起谈心，发现无产阶级革命派中有的同志不能正确对待受蒙蔽的群众；犯了错误的一些人也感到自己抬不起头来，生产积极性不高。根据部队政治工作经验，他们组织大家学习毛主席的著作以及北京邮票厂革命造反总部写的文章《我们是怎样争取和团结群众大多数的》，帮助无产阶级革命派正确对待受蒙蔽的群众。革命小将学习毛主席“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”的教导以后说：群众受蒙蔽，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派搞的鬼，我们不能歧视他们，要听毛主席的话，和他们团结在一起，共同战斗。同时，指战员们还教育受蒙蔽的群众提高阶级觉悟，明辨是非，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边。在共同提高觉悟的基础上，指战员们又组织大家学习毛主席语录：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”全车间的革命群众，团结一起，同心同德地解决生产中的问题，提高了生产效率。
    这个厂革命群众组织多，已不适应当前新的战斗任务的要求。当贵阳棉纺厂按行政部门搞联合的经验传来后，工厂的革命造反总指挥部和许多革命群众组织都说好。但是在研究怎样联合时，却产生了分歧。有个革命组织的成员说：“我们组织成立较早，联合后我们应该担任指挥。”另一个革命组织的成员却认为他们功劳大，联合后应当由他们组织的成员担任领导。这时，指战员们又组织大家学习毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，使大家认识到，风头主义、小团体主义、自由主义、本位主义是无产阶级文化大革命前进道路上的绊脚石，如果这些东西不打倒，就不能贯彻毛主席的革命路线，就不能取得革命胜利。他们破私立公，坚决同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，按行政单位的大联合搞起来了。
    随着政治思想工作的步步深入，广大革命职工迅速把无产阶级文化大革命焕发出来的革命干劲，用到生产上。七车间铣工姜正修，发扬首创精神，在全车间革命职工协助下，试制成功一种加工涡轮的新刀头。过去一个刀头只能加工一种涡轮，现在一个刀头可以加工各种涡轮。加工每个涡轮比过去少花一百余元，时间比过去快一个多月。三组工人刘武遵循毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，下定决心，改革操作方法。他找来了废铁管，利用业余时间试制成功一台自动清尘器，每天可节约酒精十二公斤，棉纱五、六公斤。机修组的革命工人也发扬了不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，三号机发生故障，他们连夜抢修，保证第二天准时开了车。
    目前，这个厂的革命职工、革命干部正进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，把革命搞得热火朝天，生产也搞得很好。二月份提前完成了生产计划，进入三月份以来，生产计划完成得也很出色。
