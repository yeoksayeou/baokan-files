Nearly 2,000 cadres and soldiers from the leadership organs of the Shenyang Military Region have formed propaganda teams to go deep into industrial and mining enterprises to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary workers said: "The PLA has brought us Chairman Mao's voice, bringing us boundless strength." Their revolutionary enthusiasm has soared, and their production drive has intensified. Production has risen in all factories.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 22 — The leadership organs of the Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently dispatched nearly 2,000 cadres and soldiers to form large-scale Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They went to more than 160 large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises in Shenyang City to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and the great strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by Chairman Mao. After the propaganda teams entered the factories, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the revolutionary workers soared, and their production drive intensified. They unanimously said: "The PLA has brought us Chairman Mao's voice, bringing us boundless strength." Currently, Shenyang, the largest industrial city in Northeast China, has seen a great situation where the army, students, and people all study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, unite to make revolution, and jointly promote production.

These propaganda teams composed of outstanding cadres and soldiers entered the factories in late February. Upon entering the factories, they ate, worked, and studied with the revolutionary workers, using Mao Zedong Thought to connect with the masses, unite the masses, and arm the masses. This helped the broad revolutionary workers see clearly the mainstream and obstacles in the current complex class struggle. They said: "The PLA came to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making our eyes clearer and our hearts brighter. Problems that were not understood are now understood, and issues that were not clear are now clear." Many factory workers used Mao Zedong Thought to see through the schemes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who, under the guise of "first grasp revolution, then promote production," attempted to disrupt production and ultimately disrupt the revolution. They armed themselves with Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. They voluntarily ensured eight hours of production labor and focused on production on the production line. Revolutionary mass organizations, to ensure the normal progress of production, reduced the number of people leaving the factory, and supervised the observance of labor discipline and production systems. Currently, production has generally increased in all factories, and some factories have significantly improved product quality. In the third workshop of the First Machine Tool Factory, the number of machine tool beds baked in the kiln each day increased from less than one kiln to more than two kilns. Now, in many factories in Shenyang, news of dual victories in revolution and production can be heard at any time. Some factories that have not yet received the propaganda teams are also excited and eagerly await the arrival of the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They said well: "Whoever listens to Chairman Mao's words, we are close to them; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight them!"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Before every action, we must explain to party members and the masses the policies we have formulated according to the situation. Otherwise, party members and the masses will act blindly without our policy leadership and execute wrong policies." The cadres and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams deeply understand that the people's army has the responsibility to deliver the party's policies and guidelines to the masses in their entirety and help the masses correctly understand them in the struggle. Only in this way can the power of the party's policies be demonstrated. Therefore, while helping the workers study Chairman Mao's works, each propaganda team, through various forms of propaganda, directly delivered the party's relevant policies and guidelines during the Cultural Revolution to the worker masses.

The broad revolutionary workers, because they have a deeper understanding of the party's policies and guidelines, therefore, have an even firmer belief in Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and are more conscious in their actions to execute and firmly implement it. Some factory mass organizations, when examining the policy towards cadres, realized that due to insufficient study of Chairman Mao's cadre policy in the past, they always felt that cadres were not to be trusted; after studying the policy, they deeply felt that not acting according to Chairman Mao's policy would result in confusion between enemies and ourselves. They said: "If we cannot distinguish between enemies and ourselves in making the revolution, how can we grasp the correct direction?" Now, Chairman Mao's cadre policy is increasingly deeply rooted in the minds of the worker masses, uniting all cadres that can be united. This has strengthened the leadership team for production and ensured the implementation of the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

In the propaganda, the cadres and soldiers put helping revolutionary workers study Chairman Mao's works first. They brought the habit of "reading every day" (reading Chairman Mao's books) into the factories, passed on the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works to the worker masses, and guided the workers to study Chairman Mao's relevant works based on their real thoughts.

The factory is a classroom for class struggle and a classroom for production struggle. During the days of interacting with the revolutionary worker masses, the cadres and soldiers participating in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams received education and training. The living class struggle in the factories made them further strengthen their sense of responsibility to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and national defense; they further reformed their thoughts and feelings in extensive contact with the worker masses, becoming more closely united with the workers; they explored some experiences in how the army should support the broad leftist masses through propaganda and investigation. Everyone is determined to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "you must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." They will firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary masses, firmly support the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses to seize power jointly, and strive for dual victories in revolution and production. They will strive to make the entire country a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    军民同心闹革命协力促生产
    沈阳部队领导机关近两千名指战员组成宣传队，深入工矿企业宣传毛泽东思想。革命职工说：“解放军带来了毛主席的声音，带来了无穷的力量。”他们的革命热情更高了，生产干劲更足了。各厂的生产普遍上升。
    据新华社沈阳二十二日电　中国人民解放军沈阳部队领导机关，最近派出近两千名指战员组成大批毛泽东思想宣传队，到沈阳市一百六十多个大中型工矿、企业，向广大革命职工宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大战略方针。宣传队进厂以后，革命职工的革命热情更高了，生产干劲更足了。他们众口同声：“解放军带来了毛主席的声音，带来了无穷的力量。”现在，我国东北最大的工业城市沈阳，出现了一派军民同学同用毛泽东思想，同心闹革命，协力促生产的大好形势。
    这些由优秀指战员组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，是二月下旬陆续进入工厂的。他们一进工厂就和革命工人同吃、同劳动、同学习，用毛泽东思想联系群众，团结群众，武装群众，使广大革命职工在当前错综复杂的阶级斗争中，认清了运动发展的主流和阻力。他们说：“解放军来宣传毛泽东思想，使我们眼更明，心更亮。想不通的问题想通了，看不准的问题看准了。”许多工厂的革命工人，用毛泽东思想识破了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，打着所谓“先抓革命，后促生产”的旗号，妄图以破坏生产进而达到破坏革命的罪恶目的。他们用毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针武装了自己，狠抓革命，猛促生产。他们自觉地保证八小时的生产劳动，在生产岗位上，全力抓好生产。无产阶级革命派组织，为了保证生产的正常进行，减少脱产外出人员，督促遵守劳动纪律和生产制度。目前，各厂的生产普遍上升，有的工厂产品质量显著提高。第一机床厂第三车间，每天上窑烘烤的机床床身，由原来的装不满一窑提高到两窑装不下了。现在，在沈阳市的许多工厂里，随时都可听到革命、生产双胜利的消息。一些没有去宣传队的工厂，工人们见此情景也莫不欢欣鼓舞，殷切期待解放军的毛泽东思想宣传队，早日到他们厂里去。他们讲得好：“谁听毛主席的话，我们就跟谁亲，谁反对毛主席，我们就跟谁拚！”
    毛主席教导我们：“在每一行动之前，必须向党员和群众讲明我们按情况规定的政策。否则，党员和群众就会脱离我们政策的领导而盲目行动，执行错误的政策。”毛泽东思想宣传队的指战员们，深深地懂得，人民的军队有责任把党的方针政策，原原本本地交给群众，并在斗争中帮助群众去正确理解。这样，才能显示党的政策的威力。因此，各个宣传队在帮助工人群众学好毛主席著作的同时，通过各种宣传形式，把文化大革命中党的有关方针政策，直接交给了工人群众。
    广大革命工人，由于较深刻地理解了党的方针政策，因此，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加坚信不移，在行动上更加自觉地执行，坚决地贯彻。一些工厂的群众组织，在检查对待干部的政策时，就觉察到由于过去对毛主席的干部政策学习不够，总觉得干部人人不可信；学了政策后，深感不按毛主席的政策办事，就会敌我不分。他们说：“干革命连敌我都不分，这怎能把握大方向呢？”现在，毛主席的干部政策，在工人群众中日益深入人心，团结了一切可以团结的干部。加强了领导生产的班子，保证了“抓革命，促生产”这一方针的贯彻执行。
    在宣传中，指战员们把帮助革命工人学好毛主席著作摆在首位。他们把“天天读”（读毛主席的书）的风气带进了工厂，把学习毛主席著作的经验传给工人群众，并根据工人现实思想问题，辅导工人学好毛主席有关著作。
    工厂是阶级斗争的大课堂，生产斗争的大课堂。参加毛泽东思想宣传队的指战员在同革命工人群众相处的日子里，受到了教育，得到了锻炼。工厂的活生生的阶级斗争，使他们更加增强了保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫国防的责任感；他们在和工人群众广泛接触中，进一步改造了自己的思想感情，和工人结合更加紧密；他们通过宣传和调查，对军队如何支持左派广大群众，也摸索到一些经验。大家决心遵照毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，坚决支持无产阶级革命派的联合夺权的斗争，夺取革命和生产的双胜利，为把全国办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗。
