The 23 revolutionary organizations participating in the seizure of power at Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9 formed a revolutionary rebel committee after seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. This committee unified the leadership of the revolution and production in the entire factory. Subsequently, they implemented "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy" from a revolutionary standpoint, reducing a large number of non-production personnel. Now, apart from retaining necessary leaders of the revolutionary organizations, the majority of workers and service personnel who had previously been fully engaged in revolutionary activities have returned to their production posts, effectively promoting the revolution and advancing production.

When the revolutionary rebel committee first proposed "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy," some leaders of individual organizations had some resistance. Some believed that only by being fully engaged in revolutionary activities could one truly appear revolutionary; others even thought that not allowing them to be fully engaged in revolutionary activities was a sign of the revolutionary organization's lack of trust in them. With these active thoughts and new problems in mind, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions. Through study, they found the root cause of their reluctance to return to production posts for revolutionary activities and their desire to be detached from production and stand above it: it was the "self" at work. They said, "Unless we overcome the 'self,' the revolution cannot be victorious, and 'streamlining and reducing bureaucracy' cannot be achieved." Many comrades studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "In any place, one must cherish manpower and resources, and never waste them for the sake of immediate gains." They further linked this to the situation before and after the seizure of power, where many people left their production posts for revolutionary activities, causing losses to production. They quickly dispelled their resistance and happily returned to their work posts. A leader of a newly established revolutionary organization said, "I heard that there are still more than 70 people in the factory who have left production for revolutionary activities. I am truly anxious. I am a boiler worker, and the workshop needs me more. I will definitely return to my production post, both to do a good job in the revolution and to manage production well."

Before the seizure of power, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory, under the pretext of supporting revolutionary organizations, agreed to all requests for full engagement and resources, squandering state resources and promoting counter-revolutionary economism, attempting to disrupt production and suppress the revolution. At that time, out of the more than 40 organizations in the factory, 140 people had left their production posts, seriously affecting production. Now, through "streamlining and reducing bureaucracy," the factory, apart from the five-member production committee, has only 36 temporary power-holding personnel from the revolutionary factions who are fully engaged in revolutionary activities. These comrades, although selected as fully engaged revolutionary leaders, still often work and labor with the workers, rarely leaving their production posts, and are highly praised by the masses.

While mobilizing fully engaged personnel to return to their production posts, the revolutionary rebel committee also seriously implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "save and make revolution," striving to reduce non-production expenditures. Before and after the seizure of power, the 23 revolutionary organizations in the factory had 23 offices, occupying more than 40 rooms and using more than 20 telephones. Each revolutionary organization also had a "small warehouse" storing a large number of cultural revolution supplies. After the revolutionary factions took power, through consultations among leftist organizations, they adjusted the offices. The telephones originally used for production were all returned to the production departments. They did not flaunt their wealth or seek grandeur, striving to reduce material consumption, save and make revolution, and ensure the needs of the production frontline. Now, the revolutionary factions in the entire factory are well united, the fighting strength of the leftist organizations has greatly increased, and both the revolution and production present a lively new situation.

    青岛国棉九厂革命组织认真实行“精兵简政”
    动员脱产人员返回生产岗位
    压缩非生产性开支，节约物资，保证生产第一线需要
    新华社济南六日电　青岛国棉九厂参加夺权的二十三个革命组织，在夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，组成了一个革命造反委员会，统一指挥全厂的革命和生产。随后，他们从革命利益出发，认真实行了“精兵简政”，减少了大量非生产人员。现在，除留下必要的革命组织的负责人以外，原革命组织中的大批脱产闹革命的工人和服务人员，都纷纷返回生产岗位，有力地推动了革命，促进了生产。
    革命造反委员会刚刚提出“精兵简政”的时候，个别组织的负责人还有一定的抵触情绪。有的认为，只有脱产出来搞革命，才象个搞革命的样子；有的甚至认为，“不叫我脱产出来搞革命，是革命组织对我不信任。”大家带着这些活思想、新问题，反复学习毛主席的指示。通过学习，他们找到了不愿回到生产岗位闹革命、只愿脱离生产高高在上的根本原因，是个“私”字在作怪。他们说，不把“私”字斗倒，革命就不能胜利，“精兵简政”也就办不到。很多同志学习了毛主席的教导：“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。”他们进一步联系到夺权前后很多人离开生产岗位闹革命，给生产造成损失的情况，迅速消除了抵触情绪，愉快地返回了工作岗位。有一个新成立的革命组织的负责人说：“听说现在厂里还有七十多人脱离生产闹革命，我心里真急。我是锅炉工人，车间更需要我。我一定返回生产岗位，既要干好革命，也要把生产抓好。”
    夺权以前，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打着“支持革命组织”的幌子，对于要求脱产、要什么物资设备等，总是满口答应，慷国家之慨，推行反革命经济主义，妄图达到破坏生产、压制革命的目的。那时候，全厂四十多个组织，就有一百四十多人脱离了生产岗位，严重地影响了生产的进行。现在，通过“精兵简政”，这个厂除了由五人组成的生产委员会之外，全厂革命派临时权力机构脱产人员只有三十六人。这些同志，虽然被选为脱产闹革命的负责人，仍然经常和工人劳动在一起，工作在一起，很少离开生产岗位，群众都很称赞。
    革命造反委员会在动员脱产人员返回生产岗位的同时，还认真贯彻执行了毛主席提出的“要节约闹革命”的教导，尽量压缩非生产性开支。夺权前后，全厂二十三个革命组织有二十三个办公室，占用四十多间房屋，二十多部电话。每个革命组织还有一个“小仓库”，存有大量的文化革命用品。革命派掌权以后，通过左派组织的协商，调整了办公室。原来生产用的电话，都退还生产部门。他们不摆阔气，不讲排场，尽量减少物资消耗，节约闹革命，保证生产第一线需要。现在，全厂革命派团结得很好，左派组织的战斗力大大增强，革命和生产都呈现出热气腾腾的新气象。
