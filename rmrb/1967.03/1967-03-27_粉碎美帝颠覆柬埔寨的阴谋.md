Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk on the 22nd exposed and condemned the U.S. imperialists' plot to assassinate him and instigate a coup in Cambodia, solemnly declaring that Cambodia will not retreat and will resist to the end. The Chinese people resolutely support Prince Sihanouk's firm stance and express great indignation at the U.S. imperialists' despicable plot.

The U.S. imperialists have always regarded Cambodia, which adheres to a policy of peace and neutrality, as a thorn in their side, using every means to pressure Cambodia and attempting to force it to change its foreign policy. Since this year, while the U.S. imperialists have been waging a war of coercion against the Vietnamese people, they have colluded with and directed their puppets in South Vietnam and Thailand to carry out more frequent and larger-scale armed provocations and invasions of Cambodia, seriously violating Cambodia's sovereignty and threatening its security.

However, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian people have bravely resisted the aggressive activities of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys. Seeing that military threats cannot subdue Cambodia, the U.S. imperialists have resorted to plotting to strengthen their subversive and destructive activities against Cambodia. The U.S. imperialists will stop at nothing in their efforts to control and invade other countries. Against this most vicious enemy, the people of all countries must remain highly vigilant and engage in a struggle of equals.

Chairman Mao said, "In the face of a beast, one must not show the slightest cowardice. We must learn from Wu Song on Jingyang Ridge. In Wu Song's view, the tiger on Jingyang Ridge, whether provoked or not, will always want to eat people. Either the tiger is killed, or one is eaten by the tiger; one of the two must happen."

Prince Sihanouk is not afraid of the various threats from the U.S. imperialists. He resolutely exposes the U.S. imperialists' subversive plots and declares that Cambodia is determined to fight the U.S. imperialists to the end. This greatly boosts the morale of the Cambodian people and strikes a blow to the arrogance of the U.S. imperialists. This is a timely and severe warning to the U.S. imperialists.

The Chinese people have always firmly supported Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia in their pursuit of a policy of peace and neutrality, and firmly support the Cambodian people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism and for the defense of national independence. In the Cambodian people's struggle against the U.S. imperialists' armed provocations and subversive plots, the 700 million Chinese people will always stand firmly on the side of the Cambodian people. We are confident that under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian people will definitely unite as one and thoroughly smash all the U.S. imperialists' evil plots.

    粉碎美帝颠覆柬埔寨的阴谋
    本报评论员
    柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十二日揭露并且谴责了美帝国主义企图对他进行谋害、在柬埔寨策动政变的颠覆阴谋，严正宣告柬埔寨决不退却，要抵抗到底。中国人民坚决支持西哈努克亲王的这种严正立场，并对于美帝国主义的卑鄙阴谋表示极大的愤慨。
    美帝国主义一向把坚持和平中立政策的柬埔寨，看作眼中钉，千方百计地对柬埔寨施加压力，妄图迫使柬埔寨改变对外政策。今年以来，美帝国主义在对越南人民大搞“以战迫和”的战争讹诈的同时，伙同和指使它的南越和泰国的走狗，更加频繁、更大规模地对柬埔寨进行武装挑衅和入侵，严重地侵犯柬埔寨的主权，威胁柬埔寨的安全。
    但是，柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王领导下，英勇地抗击了美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略活动。美帝国主义看到公开的军事威胁不能使柬埔寨屈服，就阴谋加强对柬埔寨的颠覆和破坏活动。美帝国主义为了控制和侵略别的国家，是什么样卑鄙龌龊的手段都使得出来的。对于这个最凶恶的敌人，各国人民必须保持高度的警惕，同它进行针锋相对的斗争。
    毛主席说，“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。我们要学景阳冈上的武松。在武松看来，景阳冈上的老虎，刺激它也是那样，不刺激它也是那样，总之是要吃人的。或者把老虎打死，或者被老虎吃掉，二者必居其一。”
    西哈努克亲王不怕美帝国主义的种种威胁，坚决揭露美帝国主义的颠覆阴谋，并且宣布柬埔寨决心同美帝国主义斗争到底，这就大大地长了柬埔寨民族的志气，灭了美帝国主义的威风。这对美帝国主义是一个及时的、严厉的警告。
    中国人民一贯坚决支持西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府奉行的和平中立政策，坚决支持柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义、维护民族独立的正义斗争。在柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义的武装挑衅和颠覆阴谋的斗争中，七亿中国人民将始终不渝地站在柬埔寨人民这一边。我们深信，在西哈努克亲王的领导下，柬埔寨人民一定能够团结一致，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的一切恶毒阴谋。
