Prince Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, held a press conference on March 22, exposing and denouncing the U.S. imperialist plot to assassinate him, stage a coup in Cambodia, change Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality, and turn Cambodia into an American colony.

Prince Sihanouk strongly denounced this despicable plot by U.S. imperialism. He solemnly declared: "Sihanouk is ready for battle. Sihanouk will stand with the people, the youth, and the religious community to resist to the end. He will not retreat, and he will not change his policy." He called on all patriotic Cambodians to fight as resolutely as the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Prince Sihanouk pointed out that a friend of his had traveled from Tokyo to Saigon with an American named George McCormack. McCormack had revealed to his friend the entire plot of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

McCormack said: "Sihanouk's days are numbered. We have decided to eliminate him by the end of the year." He added, "Anyone who does not stand with us is against us." He also mentioned that the CIA had spent two years plotting to overthrow Sukarno, with "very satisfactory results."

According to McCormack, U.S. imperialism is using similar tactics in Cambodia, employing Cambodians to carry out sabotage and subversive activities. The CIA might plant two high-ranking military officers with large bank accounts in Switzerland within the Cambodian armed forces, who are preparing and organizing a coup. Additionally, three members of the Cambodian government, closely collaborating with the Saigon puppet regime, might also be working for the CIA. Furthermore, there might be a major traitor in the palace, keeping an eye on Sihanouk's every move.

After exposing this plot by U.S. imperialism, Prince Sihanouk asked: "Will Cambodia become an American colony, suffering under American imperialism, which is even more despicable than French colonialism?" He firmly stated: "We will never be slaves to anyone again."

The newspaper *Newspaper of the New Era* published an editorial on March 23, stating that the Cambodian people are highly vigilant about the situation mentioned by the Head of State in his press conference on March 22. The editorial pointed out that the Cambodian people are tenaciously fighting against the agents of U.S. imperialism and have accumulated rich experience in the struggle against the plots and tricks of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Those who think the Cambodian people will submit to their manipulations will surely meet with misfortune!

    西哈努克亲王谴责美帝企图把柬埔寨变为殖民地
    柬埔寨坚决粉碎美帝颠覆阴谋
    新华社金边二十三日电　据柬埔寨《新电讯报》二十三日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十二日举行记者招待会，揭露并谴责美帝国主义阴谋杀害他本人，在柬埔寨发动政变，改变柬埔寨的和平中立政策，把柬埔寨变成美国的殖民地。
    西哈努克亲王强烈谴责美帝国主义的这个卑鄙的阴谋。他严正地宣告：“西哈努克愿意应战。西哈努克将同人民、青年和宗教界站在一起，抵抗到底。他决不退却，决不改变政策。”他号召柬埔寨所有爱国者象越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线那样坚决地进行斗争。
    西哈努克亲王指出，他的一位朋友曾经同一个叫作乔治·麦科尔姆的美国人从东京旅行到西贡。麦科尔姆有一次把美国特务机构中央情报局的阴谋原原本本地告诉了他的这位朋友。
    麦科尔姆说：“西哈努克的寿命不会长了。我们已经决定在年底之前干掉他。”“谁不同我们站在一起，就是反对我们。”他还说，中央情报局为了搞掉苏加诺花了两年的时间，“结果是十分可观的”。
    据麦科尔姆透露：美帝国主义在柬埔寨采用同样的手法，用柬埔寨人来进行破坏和颠覆活动。中央情报局可能会在柬埔寨武装部队里安插两个在瑞士银行里有大笔存款的高级军官，他们在准备和组织政变。还可能有同西贡傀儡政权密切勾结的三名柬埔寨政府成员也在为中央情报局效劳。此外，在王宫里还可能有一个大叛徒注视着西哈努克的一举一动。
    西哈努克亲王在揭露了美帝国主义的这个阴谋计划以后问道：“难道柬埔寨会变成美国的殖民地，蒙受比法国殖民主义更可恶的美国殖民主义的奴役么？”他斩钉截铁地说：“我们决不再受任何人的奴役。”
    《新电讯报》二十三日发表社论指出：柬埔寨全国人民以高度的警惕性注意国家元首在二十二日举行的记者招待会上谈到的形势。社论指出，柬埔寨人民顽强地同美帝国主义的代理人作斗争，并且在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋诡计的斗争中积累了丰富的经验。这些家伙如果认为柬埔寨人民会听从他们的摆布，肯定是要倒霉的！
