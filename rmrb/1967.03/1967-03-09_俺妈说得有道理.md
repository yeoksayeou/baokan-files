    Mother Is Right (Shandong Fast Book)
    Wáng Pèiqiú Liú Jīnbǎo

    Boom! The thunder of January's revolution roars, the red flags flutter across the land, the drums of revolution shake the earth, and the spring plowing is in full swing. Amidst this great situation, a soldier returns home. He is a model soldier named Zhang Xiaohua. The train rides like the wind, and in an instant, he is home from Beijing!

    (Narrator) Wow, that was fast! As soon as Xiaohua reached the door, he heard voices in the courtyard, some loud, some soft, some high, some low. He peeked through the crack in the door: "Ah! They're not talking; they're arguing. The ones arguing are my father and mother!"

    (Narrator) "My father is the brigade leader, and my mother is a member of the poor peasants' association. Why are they arguing now?"

    He saw the old man, furious, banging his tobacco pipe. His words were like cannon fire, boom, boom, non-stop. The old woman sat on a stool, mending her shoes. Her words were like a machine gun, rat-tat-tat, rapid-fire. The cannon met the machine gun, neither side's firepower was weak. Xiaohua thought to himself outside the door: "It seems the situation is quite complicated! Although my parents are both very stubborn, they rarely lose their tempers. Today, I wonder what it's about? Their tempers are so high? I should go in and see, no, it's not right to go in now. They are both in a rage, and if I barge in, I'll definitely mess things up. Right, I'll wait outside for a while, do some reconnaissance and investigation."

    (Narrator) Chairman Mao said, "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." Xiaohua listened clearly outside the door, remembering every word. The old man said: "Since I became the brigade leader, I have been working hard for everyone, setting an example and leading the way. Our village's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I, old man, actively participate. But now, everyone has put up big-character posters, saying my commandism is too serious, saying my subjectivism lacks investigation, saying my parochialism has a short-sighted view, saying my liberalism lacks discipline. Only shortcomings, no strengths, what use is this brigade leader of mine?"

    The old man spoke more furiously, and the old woman quickly interrupted: "Look at you, always ready to show your attitude!"

    "Hmph! I am not a small gong, for anyone to strike!" The old woman said: "Being a cadre means having cultivation, having problems means you should make a self-criticism!"

    "You, you, you, you don't analyze, you don't investigate, you seize the opportunity to blabber nonsense. This... this... I don't want to be the brigade leader anymore!"

    The old woman stood up and patted her chest: "This is not what we poor and lower-middle peasants say! Right now, spring plowing and production are at a critical juncture. You want to hide in the back and be a tail. Seize the revolution, promote production, the heavy burden is in front of us. You drop the burden and don't want to carry it, what do you want to do? Just for this reason, I have to write a big-character poster to expose you!"

    As soon as the old woman finished speaking, she was about to go out, and Zhang Xiaohua came in. The two elders were taken aback: "Huh!" "Ah!" They didn't know what to say for a moment! Xiaohua smiled and walked forward, greeting his father first and then his mother: "Both of you sit down and cool off, let's talk slowly." (Narrator) He is quite flexible! The old woman saw the reinforcements and, taking advantage of the situation, added fuel to the fire: "Child, you came at the right time, quickly help your father clean up his head."

    As soon as the old woman said this, the old man wanted to lose his temper again. Thinking that the child had just come in, he had to endure the anger. Xiaohua had a plan in mind and spoke confidently: "I understand the situation of both of you. I have already investigated outside the door. Mother is right, Father's opinion is off the mark. We are the main force of the revolution, revolution and production depend on us. We should manage national affairs, and we should be in charge of brigade affairs. You want to drop the heavy burden and let the class enemies laugh at us!"

    After speaking, Xiaohua opened his quotation book and loudly read Chairman Mao's words:

    (Narrator) "Because we are servants of the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not be afraid of others criticizing and pointing them out." "The class enemies' hearts do not die, they want to restore power and seize the seal. We must be vigilant, not allowing them to spread chaos and stir up trouble. The poor and lower-middle peasants are our close brothers, giving advice is trusting us. It is to help us dig out the 'self,' to serve the people wholeheartedly; it is to help us remember the class struggle firmly, to withstand the wind and waves; it is to help us carry the thousand-jin burden, to seize the revolution and promote production together! The river is deep, the sea is deep, but class love is deeper. How can we give up a little criticism and throw away the seal!"

    The old man heard these words, and his heart unknotted: "Hey! It's all my fault, my backbone is soft, I didn't listen to Chairman Mao's words carefully. You helped me unload the heavy burden of my mind, and my old man's heart is blooming with joy." The old woman said: "You are just stubborn, the car doesn't fall into the ditch, the gate doesn't close." The old man said: "Yes, yes, yes, you hit the drum right today. From now on, I will remember Chairman Mao's words. I can withstand criticism and blows, and I am not afraid of the heavy burden on my shoulders."

    At this moment, the whole family faced Chairman Mao's portrait and unanimously swore: "We will do what Chairman Mao says, we will do what Chairman Mao tells us to do, we will follow where Chairman Mao leads, we will strike where Chairman Mao points! With Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, the revolutionary spirit is greater than the sky! Seize the revolution, promote production, both will bloom with victory!"

    俺妈说得有道理（山东快书）
    王佩琈　刘金宝轰??，“一月革命”春雷
  响，哗啦啦，红旗飘扬满天下，咚咚咚，革命战鼓震大地，哒哒哒，大闹春耕跨战马。在一片大好形势下，有个战士去探家；他是一位五好战士，名字叫做张小华。坐上火车快如风，呜的一声，就从北京到了
  家！
  （白）嘿，真快！小华刚到家门口，就听到院里有人在说话，一声高来一声低，一声尖来一声哑。他顺着门缝往里瞧：“啊！那不是说话是吵架，吵架的正是俺爹和俺妈！”（白）“俺爹是生产大队长，
  俺妈是贫协委员，这阵
  子怎么吵起来啦？”只见老汉气冲冲，烟袋锅子直敲打；说话就象放大炮，轰?轰?不停下。老大娘坐在板凳上，手里还把鞋底纳；说话就象机关枪，突突突突打连发。这大炮遇上机关枪，谁的火力也不差。小华门外心暗想：
  “看来情况还挺复杂！他二老虽然性格都很犟，还很少把那脾气发。今天不知为哪端，两人的火气这么大？俺得进门去看看，不，这时候进去不对茬。他二老正在火头上，俺贸然插话准抓瞎。对，干脆在外头等一会儿，打个埋伏作调查。”
  （白）毛主席说：“没有调
  查就没有发言权”嘛！小华门外听得清，一句一句全记下。老汉说：“俺自打当上大队
  长，起早摸黑为大家，以身作则带头干，群众关系也不差。咱村的无产阶级文化大革
  命，俺老汉积极来参加。可如今，大伙贴出大字报，说俺命令主义太严重，说俺主观主义欠调查，说俺本位主义眼光短，说俺自由主义纪律差。只有短处没长处，我这个队长还当个啥？”老汉越说火越大，大娘急忙把话插：
  “看你这个炮筒子，动不动就把态度耍！”
  “哼！俺又不是小铜锣，谁想敲打就敲打！”大娘说：“当干部就要有修
  养，有问题你就该作检查！”
  “你你你，你不作分析不
  调查，你趁热打铁瞎哇啦。这……这……俺这个队长不想当啦！”大娘站起身来拍拍胸：
  “这哪象咱贫下中农说的
  话！这阵儿春耕生产正当紧，你却想缩在后头当尾巴。抓革命，促生产，重担子摆在咱眼下，你放下担子不想挑，你不挑重担想干啥？就凭你这一条呀，俺也得写张大字报把你来
  揭发！”老大娘说罢就要往外走，迎面进来张小华。二老人一见傻了眼：
  “嗯！”“啊！”一时不知该说啥啦！张小华笑迷迷地走上前，先叫爹来后叫妈：
  “二老先坐下消消火，有啥咱们慢慢拉。”（白）他还挺灵活哩！大娘一看援兵到，趁着火头把油加：
  “孩子你来得正凑巧，快帮你爹打扫打扫脑袋
  瓜。”大娘这一说不要紧，老汉又想把脾气发。一想到孩子刚进门，只好硬着头皮把气压。小华心里有分寸，胸有成竹地把言发：“爹妈的情况俺了解，俺早在门外作过调查。俺妈说得有道理，爹的意见可不对茬。咱们是革命的主力军，革命、生产靠咱抓。国家大事咱要管，队里大事咱当家。你想放下重担子，让阶级敌人看笑话！”说罢小华翻开语录本，高声朗读毛主席的话：
  （白）“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”“阶级敌人心不死，妄想复辟夺印把。咱们千万得警惕，不许他乱说乱动把那阴风
  刮。贫下中农是咱亲兄弟，提意见可是信任咱。为的是，帮咱把那私字挖，全心全意为人民当好家；为的是，帮咱把那阶级斗
  争牢牢记，经得住风吹和浪打；为的是，帮咱挑起千斤担，革命、生产一起抓！河深海深不如阶级友爱
  深，咱哪能挨了点批评就把大
  印撒！”老汉听了这番话，心里解开了大疙瘩：“嗨！都怪俺的腰杆软，都怪俺没好好听毛主席的
  话。你帮俺卸下了思想上的大
  包袱，俺老汉心里喜开花。”大娘说：“你这个人就是嘴
  头硬，车不掉沟不拉闸。”老汉说：“对对对，你今天
  敲鼓打对了点儿，从今后俺要牢记毛主席的
  话。经得住批评和敲打，不怕那重担肩上压。”此时刻，全家向着毛主席
  像，异口同声把誓发：“毛主席说啥咱听啥，毛主席叫咋咱就咋，毛主席开路咱们走，毛主席指哪咱打哪！”毛泽东思想一挂帅，革命干劲比天大！抓革命，促生产，双双开放胜利花。
