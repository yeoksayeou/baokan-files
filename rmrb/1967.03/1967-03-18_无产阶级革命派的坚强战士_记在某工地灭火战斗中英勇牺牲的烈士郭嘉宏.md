The proletarian revolutionary forces are the bravest and strongest. When dark clouds loom over the city and white terror reigns, they stand firm, willing to sacrifice their heads and shed their blood, but never abandon Mao Zedong Thought. When state property is threatened, they dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, disregarding personal safety, bravely rushing to rescue, until they give their blood and lives.

Here, we introduce such a steadfast warrior of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

**Daring to Confront Fire and Knives, He is Selfless and Fearless**

On January 19th at 5:10 PM, a fire suddenly broke out at a construction site in Beijing. The 60-meter-long, 13-14-meter-wide construction site was instantly engulfed in thick smoke and roaring flames, turning into a sea of fire.

In the great era of Mao Zedong, serving the people is the highest duty. Fire is the order to battle. Seeing the fire, passersby changed their direction and rushed to the scene; nearby office workers dropped their work and rushed to the scene; out-of-town revolutionary students who had already bought their tickets to leave Beijing dropped their bags and rushed to the scene. People from all directions gathered, joining the People's Liberation Army, forming a powerful fighting force, charging into the fire, climbing onto the sheds, jumping into the pits, and fearlessly battling the flames.

The 11-meter-high insulation shed had a dense network of bamboo and wooden scaffolding underneath, covered with thick layers of straw mats, reed mats, and tarps. The concrete surface of the pit, freshly poured, was also covered with straw. Adding to this were the oil supplies for construction machinery and high-voltage power lines, all of which were flammable materials. As the northwest wind picked up, 5-6-meter-high flames leaped and roared, spreading to new work areas, making the situation extremely urgent.

A deputy squad leader from a certain unit, Deng Liangwen, charged into the fire like a soldier on the battlefield. He jumped onto the burning insulation shed and started to peel off the third tarp next to the burning second tarp to cut off the fire's path. Each tarp, 14 meters long and 6 meters wide, weighed 500-600 kilograms and was laid across scaffolding spaced about 2 meters apart. Below was a sea of fire and rows of steel reinforcement bars standing like daggers. Peeling off the tarp was a heart-pounding battle. Deng Liangwen used all his strength to lift one end of the connection between the second and third tarps, but the other end was tightly bound with wire. The flames, driven by the wind, blocked the path to the scaffolding end, making it impossible to walk. The fire was about to spread along the connection between the second and third tarps. At this critical moment, a young man rushed from the south side of the shed. He had already discarded his padded jacket, wearing only a blue shirt, with smoke, soot, and mud covering his entire body. He shouted, "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory," as he helped pull open the other end of the connection between the second and third tarps, swiftly rolling up the tarp. The wind blew, and the flames roared, burning the scaffolding supports with crackling sounds, approaching the young man's side. The firelight illuminated his youthful face. He loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations, using his hands to lift the heavy tarp, rolling it up urgently, not retreating an inch from the surrounding fire.

Suddenly, the scaffolding tilted in the flames. "It's no use, the scaffolding is collapsing, retreat quickly!" someone in the crowd shouted. But the battlefield still echoed with the resolute voice: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory."

The third tarp was finally peeled off and rolled up, cutting off the fire source. But with a loud bang, the scaffolding burned through, and the hero's tall figure flashed in the firelight, falling from an 11-meter height. A steel reinforcement bar pierced his heart. The hero's blood flowed onto the beloved land of the capital.

Soldier Su Jinman took a quick step forward and pulled him, but the hero's sturdy body stood up and fell down again. He stretched his hands forward, his eyes fixed on the fire scene, as if saying, "Don't mind me, go put out the fire!"

Soldier Lü Jiazheng covered his wound with his hand, carried him to the car, and sent him to the hospital.

The time was 5:40 PM. Dusk was gradually falling, and the cold wind was biting. The fire was finally extinguished, state property was saved, but a brave soldier who participated in the firefighting had bid us farewell forever!

This martyr died for the people's interests and died a worthy death. His death is heavier than Mount Tai.

But who was this good son of the people?

Soldiers found a red copy of Chairman Mao's quotations, a notebook, a letter from home, and a complaint letter from the martyr's blood-stained pockets and padded jacket.

From these belongings, people learned that this martyr who sacrificed his life for the people's interests was Guo Jiamao, 24 years old, the production team leader of the sericulture team in Xiangshan Horticultural Farm, Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province. From these belongings, people learned that he was not only a hero in rescuing state property but also a steadfast warrior in the Cultural Revolution. He was also a victim of the capitalist reactionary line. His death was the deepest exposure, the strongest accusation, and the most powerful lash against the capitalist reactionary line!

It was a small group of leaders in the Zhenjiang Municipal Committee who insisted on the capitalist reactionary line, labeling this good warrior, who was loyal to the Party and willing to brave fire and water for the people's interests, as a "counter-revolutionary," "monster," and "active counter-revolutionary." They illegally detained him for four months, restricting his personal freedom and depriving him of his political rights, even refusing to exonerate him until his last moments.

This is intolerable!

Listen, you small group of leaders in the Zhenjiang Municipal Committee who insist on the capitalist reactionary line, where is such a "counter-revolutionary" who, at a critical moment when state property is severely threatened, steps forward bravely to rescue? Where is such a "monster" who, in the face of raging flames, remains calm and recites Chairman Mao's quotations as he charges forward? Where is such an "active counter-revolutionary" who, knowing the fire burns people, still jumps into the fire sea, sacrificing his life for the interests of the state and the people?

**Born in Hardship, Grown Under the Red Flag**

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces! Let us together review Guo Jiamao's short life journey. It will help us see how the capitalist reactionary line distorts right and wrong and confuses black and white. How a revolutionary youth was labeled a "counter-revolutionary."

Guo Jiamao was born into a poor urban family in Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province. His father was long-term unemployed, and his mother worked as a servant. The hardships of his parents and his own bitter childhood had long planted a deep hatred for class enemies in his heart.

In 1949, his hometown was liberated, and Guo Jiamao entered primary school. He determined to study hard and become a good student of Chairman Mao. In school, he studied diligently, enthusiastically participated in social work, and actively joined various labor activities inside and outside the school. During high school, he began to seriously study Chairman Mao's works. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated his heart and became the driving force for his political advancement. After reading "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he once said, "A foreigner took the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. I am a youth of New China; what can I not give to our great socialist construction cause?"

In 1964, Guo Jiamao graduated from high school. At that time, the Party called on intellectual youth to go to the countryside to build new socialist villages. The deeds of many intellectual youth dedicating themselves to agricultural construction kept flashing in his mind. Initially, he thought, "After graduating from high school, finding a job in the city would solve the living problem immediately and also reduce the burden on my aging parents." But he also thought, "When considering problems, should I start from the national interest or from the small circle of the family?" He pondered this question and reread "The Orientation of the Youth Movement." Chairman Mao said, "How can we judge whether a youth is revolutionary or not? What standard should we use? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually combines with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Chairman Mao's teachings made his confused mind clear. He finally became the first in his class to volunteer to go to the agricultural frontline where the country needed him.

That September, Guo Jiamao and more than 160 high school graduates, with full hearts of revolution, arrived at the foot of Xiangshan by the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang. They were determined to turn the reed-covered wasteland into a sericulture base with canals like a net and dense mulberry trees. On the third day of their arrival, Guo Jiamao wrote in his diary, "Now I am the farm's, the farm is mine, but ultimately I am the farm's. In the future, I will strengthen my self-improvement and love my farm even more, considering it my home."

Guo Jiamao was elected as the team leader of the first brigade. He had to lead in labor, grasp ideological work, and care for the masses' lives. This was no light burden! When encountering difficulties, he once thought, "Forget it! Let someone else do it, maybe they are stronger than me." At this moment, Chairman Mao's words educated him. Chairman Mao said, "Let others enjoy, pick the heavy burdens, suffer first, and enjoy last. Such comrades are good comrades." Under these teachings, he made up his mind, "I will stick it out, do it, not disappoint the Party's cultivation, and not be a coward."

He not only said this but also did it.

In the severe winter, the north wind was biting, and the river water was frozen. However, the construction work of the sericulture brigade was in a tense stage. To ensure construction and production in the same year, they had to quickly build dikes to prevent floods and complete the water conservancy project. Guo Jiamao led the way every day, taking off his shoes, rolling up his pants, and jumping into the icy reed marsh water. Difficulties like "stepping onto the reed marsh is like climbing a mountain of knives" were all thrown to the back of his mind. Guo Jiamao and his comrades crawled through the marshes, rolled in the mud pits, and the sharp reed tips pierced his feet, and heavy burdens injured his waist. However, the plan to build and produce in the same year proceeded smoothly. In the first spring, Guo Jiamao and his comrades grafted 1.6 million excellent varieties of mulberry saplings on nearly a thousand acres of reed marsh. When the green saplings grew vigorously, Guo Jiamao watched with joy and was even more motivated to work hard. Whenever tasks were distributed within the brigade, he always volunteered to take on heavy burdens, leaving the convenient tasks to others and keeping the difficulties for himself.

Experienced old workers often said: sowing in summer is like taking fire from the fire. Indeed, the summer sun in the south scorched the entire earth. If the mulberry seeds were sown in the field and not watered diligently, they would not germinate. Every morning, before the sun rose, Guo Jiamao and everyone else came to the field to turn the soil, make ridges, and carry water, working up a sweat. As the sun rose higher, the weather became scorching, but Guo Jiamao still carried heavy burdens, running swiftly in the fields. His dark back glistened under the fierce sun. It was hard to see any traces of a young intellectual on him.

During the silkworm rearing period, Guo Jiamao worked even more intensely. To ensure the silkworms ate well and grew fast, he devoted countless efforts and sweat. Once, during the silkworm rearing period, continuous heavy rain hit, and the silkworm house was about to run out of mulberry leaves, leaving the silkworms to starve. The workers in the silkworm house were anxious. At this moment, Guo Jiamao, with a few classmates, drenched in rain, carried heavy baskets of mulberry leaves to the silkworm house, ensuring the silkworms had food. After ensuring the silkworms had food, he immediately started boiling ginger tea, handing it to the classmates soaked in the rain, encouraging everyone to drink the ginger tea and rest quickly. He himself quietly washed and dried everyone's dirty clothes.

In the autumn of 1965, a typhoon hit Zhenjiang City. The surging waves of the Yangtze River and the torrential rain threatened the fruits of everyone's blood and sweat—the new dike. Guo Jiamao was then sick in bed with a fever. But knowing the situation, he resolutely dragged his sick body to the riverbank. On the dike, he braved the wind and rain, fighting with his comrades for 36 hours, forcing the tide to retreat and saving the dike.

"Many things are urgent; the earth turns, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment." Under Guo Jiamao and all the workers' selfless labor, the sericulture brigade underwent a dramatic transformation in one year. The state's investment was recovered, and production flourished. Guo Jiamao was also selected as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and an advanced agricultural producer in Zhenjiang City. On March 12, 1965, he wrote in his diary, "Today is another unforgettable day in my life. I can participate in the meeting as an advanced agricultural producer. How can I not be happy? ... This honor can only serve as a spur for me. In the future, I will definitely listen to the Party's words better, rely on the masses more, raise my class consciousness, and work and labor better for the Party and the people ..."

Of course, in Guo Jiamao's life journey, not every step was straight. He also had various shortcomings and mistakes, but his revolutionary direction was always correct.

However, such a youth who grew up under the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought was falsely labeled a "counter-revolutionary" during the Cultural Revolution. His excellent performances in the brigade were all denounced as "waving the red flag to oppose the red flag," "deceiving the masses, gaining trust, and laying the foundation for the 'June 15th' black meeting."

So, what did Guo Jiamao do wrong during the Cultural Revolution? What kind of meeting was "June 15th"?

**Revolution at the Forefront, Rebel to the End**

On June 15, 1966, the revolutionary workers of the sericulture brigade and the revolutionary teachers and students of the Farming and Reading School, under the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively participated in the Cultural Revolution. Inspired by the revolutionary big-character poster of Nie Yuanzi and others at Peking University, they launched an attack on the small group of capitalist-roaders within the sericulture brigade, posting big-character posters, listing facts, and exposing the main leaders' crimes of opposing the study of Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revisionist line, and resisting the Cultural Revolution. Due to this person's evil attitude, the masses, indignant, spontaneously gathered to struggle against him. At that time, everyone was excited, and the order was a bit chaotic. Thus, Guo Jiamao stepped forward, presided over the meeting, arranged some people to protect the power station that could not stop working, strengthened the security of the silkworm house, allowed everyone to speak in an orderly manner on the stage, stopped the chaotic situation, and made the meeting proceed normally. Then, he reported the situation in the brigade to the Municipal Committee and the Public Security Bureau over the phone. Was there anything wrong with what Guo Jiamao did?

That night, the work team from the Zhenjiang Municipal Committee arrived at the sericulture brigade. The next day, they incited the ignorant suburban farmers to attack and beat the revolutionary workers of the sericulture brigade, creating a bloody massacre. On June 17th, they, under the pretext of "protection," detained Guo Jiamao and others. They slandered the revolutionary actions of the masses on "June 15th" as a "counter-revolutionary restoration rebellion meeting" and slandered Guo Jiamao as the "leader of the black meeting." Thus, the revolutionary flames that had just ignited in the sericulture brigade were suppressed.

For more than four months, these people who insisted on executing the capitalist reactionary line did everything they could to slander, distort, defame, threaten, and deceive Guo Jiamao. They told Guo Jiamao, "You are 23 years old, young but not young. If you insist on your opinion, I will charge you with resisting the leadership of the work team. ..." "You won't die so easily. If you die, this account will be settled with your brother and sister. ..." To achieve the goal of suppressing the revolutionary masses, they even dared to change Guo Jiamao's family background and spread rumors everywhere: "Guo Jiamao's brother is also a monster," "Guo Jiamao attempted to escape and commit suicide." They used every means to prevent Guo Jiamao from reading newspapers, listening to the radio, communicating with the outside world, reading revolutionary books like "The Song of Ouyang Hai," and even forbade him from laughing. They were extremely afraid of Mao Zedong Thought and dared to block Guo Jiamao from studying Chairman Mao's works in every way. But the crow's wings cannot cover the sun's glory! With the help of comrades, Guo Jiamao finally read the four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" during the more than four months of detention, further mastering the ideological weapon of struggle. Guo Jiamao wrote in his complaint letter, "I once had the thought of death, but Chairman Mao taught me that death should be worthy. ..." "Respected leader Mao Zedong, you saved me, making me endure their torture time and time again. ..." "It is Chairman Mao who told me, resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." "It is Chairman Mao who taught me, 'Rebellion is justified.' "You capitalist lords, don't be too happy. Don't think that by labeling me with 'counter-revolutionary,' 'anti-Party element' hats, I won't dare to 'speak and act recklessly,' won't dare to rebel against you. No! With Chairman Mao and the Central Committee backing us up... victory belongs to us!"

On October 18, 1966, Guo Jiamao finally arrived in Beijing and reunited with his comrades, receiving the care and support of central leaders. On November 3rd, this was the happiest day of Guo Jiamao's life. He and his comrades were warmly received by the most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square. His diary recorded his then surging emotions:

"When I saw Chairman Mao standing on Tiananmen, waving to us with a radiant face, I didn't know what to say. I shouted from the bottom of my heart, 'Long live Chairman Mao!' I shouted and jumped, unwilling to leave for a long time. Chairman Mao seemed to say: Young man, go ahead! Bravely charge ahead!

"Respected Chairman Mao! It is you who gave me happiness, it is you who gave me freedom, it is you who gave me truth! I deeply feel that only under your leadership can I have freedom, can I bravely fight, and can I achieve one victory after another!

"Chairman Mao, I will follow you forever!"

Guo Jiamao felt that he had suddenly grown much taller in one day, and his body was suddenly filled with boundless strength. If, when Guo Jiamao fled from Zhenjiang alone to Beijing, he had strongly wanted to clear his name, then now he was no longer just thinking about himself, nor just for the sericulture brigade. He was concerned about the entire Cultural Revolution in Zhenjiang City, the entire state's affairs. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought made him see clearly and have a broad mind. He was determined to return to Zhenjiang and unite the proletarian revolutionary forces in Zhenjiang.

On January 5th of this year, Guo Jiamao came to the capital for the second time. This time, he came as a representative of 12 revolutionary mass organizations in Zhenjiang City, entrusted by the revolutionary masses of Zhenjiang City. Guo Jiamao's two trips to Beijing reflected the changes in the revolutionary situation in Zhenjiang. After experiencing a tortuous, winding, and dark journey, dawn was in sight. Those who once arbitrarily labeled revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" were now under the scrutiny of all and surrounded by revolutionary masses.

"One should pursue the remaining courage to defeat the fleeing enemy and should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." Guo Jiamao and his comrades were determined to carry out this magnificent Cultural Revolution to the end. On January 19th, he and his comrades went to the Institute of Political Science and Law for revolutionary linkage, seeking the support of revolutionary students. On the way, when he saw a construction site on fire, his proletarian revolutionary heart, which cherished state property, also burned. He firmly walked his last step in life on the fire scene, sacrificing himself for the cause of socialist construction.

The Yangtze River flows endlessly, and the mulberry forest is lush. One Guo Jiamao has sacrificed himself, but thousands of proletarian revolutionaries are advancing bravely. The place where Guo Jiamao lived, worked, and fought—Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province—is seeing a great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary forces, fighting to seize power from the small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party, advancing wave upon wave.

    无产阶级革命派的坚强战士
    ——记在某工地灭火战斗中英勇牺牲的烈士郭嘉宏
    无产阶级革命派，最勇敢，最坚强。
    当黑云压城，白色恐怖笼罩的时候，他岿然屹立，做到头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢；当国家财产遭受损失的时候，他刀山敢上，火海敢闯，不顾个人安危，英勇进行抢救，直到献出鲜血和生命。
    这里要向大家介绍的，就是这样一个无产阶级革命派的坚强战士。
             闯火海刀山　他无私无畏
    今年一月十九日下午五时十分，北京某建筑工地突然不慎失火。六十米长、十三四米宽的施工现场，霎时浓烟滚滚，烈火熊熊，变成一片火海。
    在伟大的毛泽东时代，为人民服务是最高职责。火光就是战斗命令，看见火光，过路行人改变了前进的方向，奔向火场；附近机关企业的职工，撂开工作，冲出办公室，奔向火场；已经买好车票就要离开北京的外地革命师生，扔下手里的大包小件，奔向火场。人们从四面八方汇集拢来，协同施工的人民解放军，组成一支强大的战斗队伍，冲向火海，爬上工棚，跳下基坑，奋不顾身地同烈火展开激烈的搏斗。
    十一米高的保暖棚，底下是密密麻麻的竹木脚手架，顶上覆盖着厚实的草垫子、芦苇席和篷布，基坑底下刚刚浇灌不久的混凝土路面上也铺满了稻草，加上施工机械用的油料，高压输电线路等等，这一切都是易燃物品。随着西北风起处，五六米高的火舌，翻腾着，咆哮着，不断向新的工区蔓延，形势万分危急。
    某部副排长邓良文象在战场上冲锋那样，一进火场就跳到烈火熊熊的保暖棚上，动手去揭开正在燃烧的二号篷布旁边的三号篷布，以便切断火路。十四米长、六米宽的篷布，每块五六百斤重，横盖在左右间隔约两米的棚架上，下面就是一片火海和一排排尖刀一样直立着的墙基钢筋。揭开篷布是一场惊心动魄的战斗。邓良文用尽全身力量刚把二、三号篷布连接处的一端掀开，但另一端还被铅丝紧紧捆在一起。烈火随风卷来，到棚架那端的去路已被火焰封住，不能行走，眼看火舌就要沿着二、三号篷布连接处烧过来。在这紧要关头，暖棚南边冲上来一个小伙子，他上身的棉袄早已甩掉，只穿一件蓝色单衣，烟硝泥水沾满他的全身。他一边高喊：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一边动手去拉开邓良文无法拉开的连接二、三号篷布的另一端，敏捷地抢卷篷布。风起火扬，支撑暖棚的架子噼噼啪啪地燃烧起来，火焰呼啦呼啦地迫近小伙子的身边，火光映红了他那青春焕发的脸颊。他嘴里高声诵读毛主席语录，手里掀起平时两三个人还掀不动的沉重的篷布，边拽边卷，争分夺秒，对于身旁的大火，寸步也不退让。
    忽然，棚架在烈火中倾斜了。“不行了，架子要塌了，赶快后撤！”救火的群众中有人高声叫喊。但火场上仍然响彻着宏亮的声音：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    三号篷布终于被揭开，卷了起来，火源被切断了。但是随着一声巨响，暖棚架子烧断了，英雄高大的身躯在火光中闪动了一下，从十一米的高处摔了下去。一支墙基钢筋，刺中了他的心脏。英雄的鲜血，汩汩地流在他无限热爱的首都的土地上。
    战士苏金满一个箭步跑过去拉了他一把，英雄健壮的身躯挺立起来又躺下去。他两手伸向前方，眼睛凝视火场，仿佛在说：“不要管我，快去救火！”
    战士吕家章用手捂着他的伤口，抬着他上汽车，护送他到医院。
    时间已是五点四十分。暮色逐渐苍茫，寒风更加凛冽。大火终于被扑灭了，国家财产保住了，然而一名参加救火的英勇战士却和我们永别了！
    这位烈士，为人民利益而死，死得其所。他的死，是比泰山还要重的。
    但是，这个人民的好儿子，究竟是谁呢？
    战士们从英雄血染的衣兜和棉袄里，翻出来一本红彤彤的毛主席语录、一个记事本、一封家信、一份控告书。
    从这些遗物中，人们才知道这个为人民利益献出自己生命的烈士叫郭嘉宏，今年二十四岁，是江苏省镇江市象山园艺场蚕桑工区的生产队长。从这些遗物中，人们才知道他不仅是一个抢救国家财产的英雄，而且是无产阶级文化大革命中一名坚强的战士。他也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。他的死，对于资产阶级反动路线是最深刻的揭露，是最强烈的控诉，是最有力的鞭挞！
    正是镇江市委内一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的负责人，把这样一个对党赤胆忠心，为人民利益赴汤蹈火的好战士，打成了“反党分子”、“牛鬼蛇神”、“现行反革命”，并且把他非法关押达四个月之久，限制他的人身自由，剥夺他的政治权利，直到他牺牲前夕还拒不给他平反。
    是可忍，孰不可忍！
    镇江市委内一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的负责人听着，哪里有这样的“反党分子”，当国家财产遭受损失的严重时刻，他挺身而出，奋勇抢救？哪里有这样的“牛鬼蛇神”，在熊熊烈火面前，他面不改色心不跳，高声诵读毛主席语录向前冲？哪里有这样的“现行反革命”，明知火烧人，偏去蹈火海，为了国家和人民的利益，不惜牺牲自己的生命？
            生在苦水洼　长在红旗下
    无产阶级革命派的战友们！让我们共同来看看郭嘉宏短促的生命途程，它将帮助我们认清这条资产阶级反动路线是怎样颠倒是非，混淆黑白。一个革命青年是怎样被打成“反革命”的。
    郭嘉宏出生在江苏省镇江市一个城市贫民的家庭里。父亲长期失业，母亲外出当佣工。父母的苦难遭遇，自己的辛酸童年，早就在他心里种下了对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨。
    一九四九年，家乡解放，郭嘉宏进了小学。他下定决心，一定要好好读书，做毛主席的好学生。在学校里，他勤奋学习，热心做社会工作，积极参加校内外各项劳动。读高中时，他开始认真地学习毛主席著作。毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了他的心，成为他政治上前进的动力。他在学习了《纪念白求恩》以后，就曾说过：“一个外国人把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业。我是一个新中国的青年，还有什么不能献给我们伟大的社会主义建设事业呢？”
    一九六四年，郭嘉宏高中毕业。当时，党向知识青年发出上山下乡建设社会主义新农村的号召，许多知识青年献身农业建设的事迹，一件件在他的脑海里翻腾。开始时他想：“高中毕业后，在城里找个工作，生活问题立刻解决了，又可以减轻年迈的双亲的负担。”但是他又想：“考虑问题，究竟是从国家利益出发，还是从家庭小圈子出发？”他带着这个问题重新学习了《青年运动的方向》。毛主席说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”毛主席的这些教导，使他纷乱的脑际豁然开朗。他终于在班上第一个报名到祖国需要的农业战线上去。
    这年九月，郭嘉宏等一百六十多名高中毕业生，抱着满腔的革命热情，来到了象山脚下长江滩边的镇江象山园艺场蚕桑工区。他们决心要把这芦花纷飞的荒滩，建设成沟渠如网，桑树成荫的蚕桑基地。来场第三天，郭嘉宏就在日记中写道：“现在我是场的，场也是我的，但是归根结底我是场的，今后还要加强自我改造，更加热爱自己的场，以场为家。”
    郭嘉宏被选为第一中队的生产队长。劳动要带头，思想工作要抓好，群众生活要关心，这个担子不轻啊！当遇到困难的时候他曾经想过：“算了吧！让别人干说不定比自己强得多。”这时，又是毛主席的话教育了他。毛主席说：“享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”在这些话的启示下，他下定决心“顶下去，干下来，不辜负党的培养，不做可耻的懦夫。”
    他不但这样说了，而且这样做了。
    严冬，北风凛冽，河水凝冰。然而蚕桑工区的建场工作却进入紧张阶段。为了当年建场当年投入生产，必须迅速筑堤防洪，修好水利工程。郭嘉宏每天带头脱掉鞋子，高卷裤脚，跳进刺骨的苇滩冰水中去。什么“上了芦柴滩，好比上刀山”等困难，统统被他抛到九霄云外。郭嘉宏和战友们一起在沼泽里爬过，在泥坑里滚过，利刃般的苇尖刺破过他的脚，沉重的担子压伤过他的腰，然而蚕桑工区当年建场投入生产的计划进展得很顺利。第一年春天，郭嘉宏和他的战友们就在近千亩芦苇滩上，嫁接了一百六十万株优良品种的桑苗。当绿油油的桑苗茁壮生长的时候，郭嘉宏看在眼里，喜在心上，更加激励自己努力工作。每当场内分配任务，他总是勇于挑重担，把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己。
    有经验的老职工常说：夏季播种是火中取种。是的，南方夏天的骄阳，把整个大地烤得滚烫。桑籽撒在田里，如果不勤浇水，就休想它会发芽。每天清晨，太阳还未升起，郭嘉宏就和大家一起来到田里，翻土、作畦、挑水，忙得一身是汗。太阳渐渐升高了，天气灼热了，郭嘉宏照样挑起重担子，健步如飞，奔跑在田间。他那黑黝黝的脊背在烈日下闪闪发光。从他身上已经很难看到小知识分子的书生气。
    养蚕时期，郭嘉宏工作得更紧张了。为了让蚕儿吃得饱，长得快，他不知花了多少心血，洒了多少汗水。有一次养蚕期间遇上连续大雨，眼看蚕室桑叶吃光了，蚕儿就要挨饿。养蚕室的工作人员焦急万分。就在这时，郭嘉宏带着几个同学，浑身被雨水浸透，背着沉甸甸的桑篓，走向蚕室，保证了蚕儿不断“粮”。蚕儿有了吃的，他又接着动手煮姜茶，送到挨雨淋的同学手里，动员大家喝完姜茶赶紧休息。他自己却悄悄地把大家的脏衣服洗净烤干。
    一九六五年秋季，台风袭击镇江市。汹涌澎湃的江水，倾盆的大雨，威胁着大家血汗劳动的结晶——新大堤。郭嘉宏当时正因病卧床，发着烧。但他知道这些情况后，就毅然决然拖着病体奔向江边，在江堤上，他顶着狂风暴雨，和战友们共同坚持战斗了三十六个小时，迫使潮水低头，保住江堤。
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”蚕桑工区在郭嘉宏和全体职工的忘我劳动下，一年之间旧貌变新颜。国家的投资收回来了，生产搞得蓬蓬勃勃。郭嘉宏也被选为镇江市的学习毛主席著作积极分子和农业先进生产者。一九六五年三月十二日这天，他在日记中这样写道：“今天是我一生中又一个难忘的日子，我能以一个农业先进生产者的身份参加大会，怎么能不叫我高兴呢！……这种荣誉只能作为对我的鞭策。今后我一定要更好地听党的话，更好地依靠群众，提高阶级觉悟，更好地为党和人民劳动和工作。……”
    当然，在郭嘉宏的生命途程中，并不是每一步都是笔直的。他也有这样或那样的缺点和错误，但是他的革命大方向始终是正确的。
    可是，这样一个在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露下成长起来的青年，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中竟然被诬为“现行反革命”。他在工区的种种优良表现，一律被斥为“打着红旗反红旗”，“是为了欺骗群众，骗取信任，为‘六·一五’黑会打基础。”
    那末，郭嘉宏究竟在文化大革命运动中做错了什么事？“六·一五”是个什么性质的会呢？
               革命当先锋　造反反到底
    一九六六年六月十五日，蚕桑工区的革命职工和耕读学校的革命师生，在党中央和毛主席的伟大号召下，积极投入无产阶级文化大革命中。他们在北京大学聂元梓等同志的革命大字报的精神鼓舞下，向蚕桑工区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动进攻，贴了大字报，列举事实，揭露了主要领导人反对学习毛主席著作，推行修正主义路线，抗拒文化大革命等罪行。由于这个家伙态度恶劣，群众激于义愤，自发地围在一起斗争了他。当时大家情绪激昂，秩序有些混乱。于是，郭嘉宏挺身而出，主持会议，安排一些人去保护工作不能停顿的电灌站，加强了蚕室的保卫工作，让大家有秩序地上台发言，制止了混乱现象，使大会正常进行。接着，他又把场里发生的情况用电话告知市委和公安局。这一切，郭嘉宏哪一件做得不对呢？
    当夜，镇江市委工作组来到了蚕桑工区。第二天，他们就挑动不明真相的郊区农民围攻和殴打蚕桑工区的革命职工，制造流血惨案。六月十七日，他们以“保护”为名，把郭嘉宏等关押起来。他们诬蔑“六·一五”的群众革命行动是“暴动性反革命复辟会”，诬蔑郭嘉宏是“黑会的主将”。这样，蚕桑工区刚刚燃烧起来的革命火焰被镇压了下去。　
    四个多月中，这些坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的人，对郭嘉宏极尽诬蔑、歪曲、诽谤、恐吓、欺骗之能事。他们对郭嘉宏说：“你二十三岁，既年轻，又不年轻。如果你坚持自己的意见，我要给你加上抗拒工作组领导的罪名。……”“你要死也没有那么容易。你死了，这笔账就记在你哥哥妹妹身上。……”为了达到镇压革命群众的目的，他们竟敢篡改郭嘉宏的家庭成份，并且四出造谣：“郭嘉宏的哥哥也是牛鬼蛇神”，“郭嘉宏企图逃跑自杀”。他们千方百计不让郭嘉宏看报纸，不让听广播，不让和外边通信，不让看《欧阳海之歌》等革命书籍，甚至连笑也不准笑。他们极端害怕毛泽东思想，竟敢千方百计阻拦郭嘉宏学习毛主席著作。但是，乌鸦的翅膀怎能遮住太阳的光辉！在同志的帮助下，郭嘉宏终于在四个多月的关押生活中，把四卷宝书——《毛泽东选集》通读一遍，进一步掌握了斗争的思想武器。郭嘉宏在控告书中写道：“我曾经有过死的念头，是毛主席教导我，死要死得其所。……”“敬爱的领袖毛主席他老人家救了我，使我一次又一次地经受了他们对我的折磨。……”“是毛主席告诉我，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“是毛主席教导我：‘造反有理’”。“资产阶级老爷们，你们不要高兴得太早了，你们不要以为给我扣上‘反革命’、‘反党分子’的帽子，我就不敢
  ‘乱说乱动’，就不敢造你们的反。不！有毛主席党中央给我们撑腰……胜利是属于我们的！”
    一九六六年十月十八日，郭嘉宏终于来到北京，和他的战友汇合在一起，受到中央负责同志的关怀和支持。十一月三日，这是郭嘉宏毕生最幸福的日子，他和他的战友在天安门前受到最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切接见。他的日记记下了他当时热血沸腾的心情：
      “当我看到毛主席满面红光站在天安门上向我们招手时，我不知说什么好，我从心底发出了‘毛主席万岁’的欢呼声，我喊呀，跳呀，久久不愿离开。毛主席仿佛在说：小伙子干吧！勇敢地闯吧！
      “敬爱的毛主席！是您给了我幸福，是您给了我自由，是您给了我真理！我深深地感到只有在您的领导下，我才能有自由，才能勇敢战斗，才能取得一个又一个的胜利！
      “毛主席呀，我永远跟着您！”
    郭嘉宏觉得自己一天之间突然高大了许多，浑身陡然增添了无穷的力量。如果说，当郭嘉宏只身逃离镇江北上来京的时候，他曾经强烈地想要为自己平反，那末现在他考虑的再不是单纯为他个人，甚至也不仅仅是为了蚕桑工区，他关心的是整个镇江市的无产阶级文化大革命运动，整个国家大事。毛泽东思想的光辉照得他眼明心亮，胸怀广阔。他决心返回镇江，把镇江的无产阶级革命派联合起来。
    今年一月五日，郭嘉宏第二次来到首都。这回他是作为镇江市十二个革命群众团体的代表，受镇江市革命群众的委托来的。郭嘉宏两次来京，反映了镇江革命形势的变化。在经历了一段崎岖、曲折、黑暗的历程之后，曙光就在面前。那些昔日随便把革命群众打成“反革命”的人，如今已处在众目睽睽之下，陷入革命群众的包围之中。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”郭嘉宏和他们的战友决心要把这场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。一月十九日这天，他和战友们一起到政法学院进行革命串连，争取革命同学的支援。路上当他看到某工地失火时，他那无产阶级革命者爱护国家财产的赤忱的心也跟着燃烧起来。他在火场上坚定地走完了他生命途程中的最后一步，为社会主义建设事业光荣牺牲。
    江水滔滔，桑林青青，一个郭嘉宏牺牲了，千万个无产阶级革命者在奋勇前进。郭嘉宏生前生活、劳动、战斗过的地方——江苏镇江市，无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争，正在波澜壮阔，滚滚向前。
