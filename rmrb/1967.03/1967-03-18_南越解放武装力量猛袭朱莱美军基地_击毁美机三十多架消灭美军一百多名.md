HANOI, March 17 (Xinhua) - According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the liberation forces of Quang Nam Province launched a fierce attack on the Chu Lai U.S. Air Force base and a command post on a small island near An Xuyen on the night of March 5. Preliminary reports indicate that the liberation forces destroyed 32 U.S. jet aircraft and killed 165 U.S. invaders.

During this attack, the liberation forces' artillery accurately hit the center of the Chu Lai heavy jet aircraft base, causing a series of massive explosions that engulfed the entire base in thick smoke and flames. The entire An Xuyen area was also illuminated by the blaze.

This is the fifth attack by the liberation forces of Quang Nam Province on the Chu Lai U.S. military base since October 1965. In the previous four attacks, they destroyed 120 U.S. aircraft, damaged 22, and killed 754 U.S. invaders.
