	Class Analysis Must Be Applied to Cadres
		Qi Lihe Commune, Jingjiapu Brigade, Yi County, Liaoning Province, farmer Dai Shulin

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of first importance in the revolution." It is entirely wrong to adopt an attitude of indiscriminate rejection and overthrow towards cadres without conducting a class analysis. This approach prevents us from examining the entire history and work of cadres, and it fails to distinguish between those who are in power representing the proletariat and those who are in power representing the capitalist road. It views all those in power as deserving of overthrow and all cadres who make mistakes as needing to be removed. In reality, the vast majority of cadres are good or relatively good, while only a small handful are taking the capitalist road. The situation in our brigade is the same; most cadres are good or relatively good. They follow Chairman Mao and steadfastly walk the socialist path. Although they have some shortcomings and mistakes in their daily work, after receiving criticism from the masses, they still stand tall, examine themselves, and lead the way in mobilizing the masses to carry out the revolution and promote spring plowing. Chairman Mao's teachings and the facts have given me a great education, making me realize that in the complex class struggle, we must keep our eyes sharp and distinguish between friends and enemies. If we do not conduct a class analysis of cadres and instead reject and overthrow all of them, we will go against Chairman Mao's teachings and cause harm to the revolutionary cause.

	After distinguishing the type of cadres in power, we must also adopt different methods to deal with them. Chairman Mao says: "The two types of contradictions—those between enemies and us and those within the people—are different in nature and thus require different methods of resolution. Simply put, the former is a matter of distinguishing between enemies and us, while the latter is a matter of distinguishing right from wrong." A small handful of cadres within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are our enemies, and we must not be lenient with them. The Cultural Revolution is precisely about exposing, criticizing, and overthrowing them, eliminating their influence, and ensuring that our country will never change color. As for proletarian cadres, even if some of them have made mistakes, even serious ones, as long as they do not hide their faults and are willing to be cured, they remain our class brothers and are part of the people's internal contradictions. For such cadres, we must follow Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient." We should help them recognize their mistakes, root out the "disease," and ensure they follow Chairman Mao closely in the future, never straying from the correct path again. Once they recognize and correct their mistakes, we must believe in them, support them, rely on them, and allow them to thoroughly reform themselves in the new struggle, so that together we can carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion!

    对待干部要作阶级分析
    辽宁义县七里河公社景家堡大队社员  戴书林
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”对干部不作阶级分析，采取一概排斥、一概打倒的态度是十分错误的。它使我们不看干部的全部历史和全部工作，也不分清谁是无产阶级当权派，谁是走资本主义道路的当权派，认为凡是当权派都要打倒，凡是犯错误的干部都得下台。实际上，干部里面绝大部分都是好的和比较好的，走资本主义道路的只是一小撮。我们队的干部情况也是这样，多数是好的和比较好的，他们跟着毛主席，坚持走社会主义道路。虽然他们平时有些缺点和错误，但是，他们受到群众批评以后，照样挺起腰杆，边检查自己，边带头领着社员抓革命，促春耕。毛主席的教导和事实给了我很大的教育，使我认识到，在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，千万得擦亮眼睛，分清敌我。如果对干部不作阶级分析，排斥一切，打倒一切，这就违背了毛主席的教导，会给革命事业带来损失。
    分清干部是啥样的当权派以后，还得用不同的方法来对待。毛主席说：“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。简单地说起来，前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和我们是敌我矛盾，对他们不能讲客气，搞文化大革命就是要把他们揪出来斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，肃清他们的影响，使我国永远不变颜色。对无产阶级当权派，尽管有些人犯了这样或那样的错误，甚至是严重的错误，只要他们不讳疾忌医，仍然是我们的阶级兄弟，是属于人民内部矛盾。对这样的干部，咱们就得照毛主席说的“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，帮助他们认识自己的错误，把“病”根挖出来，使他们今后紧紧跟着毛主席，再不往错道上走。只要他们认识了错误，改正了错误，我们就要相信他们，支持他们，依靠他们，让他们在新的斗争中彻底改造自己，共同把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
