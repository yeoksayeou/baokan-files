Currently, a form of guildism is prevalent. There are organizations for drivers, ticket sellers, cooks, and graduates of universities in 1965, and so on. These organizations, from the moment they were established, did not prioritize the class interests of the entire proletariat but emphasized the specific demands of certain professions. They often do not politically criticize the bourgeois reactionary line but instead complain about the social status of their profession and make various economic demands regarding wages and benefits. This is not a united organization of the proletarian revolutionaries but a guildist group formed for the narrow, selfish economic interests of a few.

Organizations that use the banner of a certain year's graduates may indignantly say that they have nothing to do with guildism. We say, their nature is similar. Regardless of which year's university graduates, they are not uniformly part of a single class. Students from the same year have different class standpoints and political views, which means there are class contradictions, and there are left, middle, and right factions. Organizations that erase these class boundaries are not proletarian revolutionary groups but are inevitably controlled by bourgeois forces. What is the difference between them and the bourgeois alumni associations?

Guildism breaks down the working class into many small groups and gathers people with different political views together. Clearly, it is not conducive to revolutionary unity but is beneficial for the enemy's strategy of divide and conquer; it is not conducive to unity but is beneficial for those with ulterior motives to create chaos. At present, it seriously hinders the proletariat's struggle for power. The proletariat must achieve its great unity by thoroughly defeating guildism. All guildist organizations should be disbanded.

Guildism is a tool used by the bourgeoisie to split the ranks of the working class. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party stirred up a counter-revolutionary economic wind, and guildist organizations emerged in response. They form one organization to get a batch of funds, using an organizational name to obtain a sum of money. Guildism, by pulling together a group of people and excluding another group; by highlighting one profession and excluding another; by excluding revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals. This precisely meets the requirements of the bourgeoisie and is a reactionary trend.

In the history of the international workers' movement, guildist (or gangsterist) organizations have all been yellow unions of this kind. Guildism emphasizes the special interests of a certain profession or the special demands for a certain issue, and when the bourgeoisie uses some material interests to satisfy their immediate needs, they follow the bourgeoisie. As long as they can get a share, they disregard the overall interests of the proletariat. Lenin said: "...to place the guild interests of the workers above class interests is to sacrifice the interests of the entire working class, the interests of the dictatorship of the proletariat, for the temporary, partial interests of the workers."

Chairman Mao said: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." Obviously, in class society, there is only class unity, not classless unity; it is either the unity of the proletariat or the unity of the bourgeoisie. Guildism is a manifestation of opportunism. Wherever guildism thrives, it is necessarily a place where counter-revolutionary economism is rampant.

We have noticed that guildists are raising the banner of "rebellion" while running around for narrow private interests. The revolutionary faction armed with Mao Zedong Thought can completely see through the essence of guildism, expose it, and defeat it. Let us rise up and attack it, and smash guildism!

    搞臭行会主义
    《文汇报》三月十一日社论
    目前，流行一种行会主义。什么司机、售票员的组织呀，什么炊事员的组织呀，什么一九六五年大专学校毕业生的组织呀，等等。这些组织，从它一建立的时候起，就不是从整个无产阶级的阶级利益出发，而是强调某一个工种具体的特殊要求。他们往往不是从政治上搞臭资产阶级反动路线，而是诉述本工种社会地位如何如何，从工资福利等方面提出种种经济主义要求。这决不是无产阶级革命派的联合组织，而是为了一部分人的狭隘的自私的经济利益而搞起来的行会主义团体。
    以某某年级毕业生为旗号的组织可能会愤愤不平地说，他们与行会主义扯不上。我们说，性质相似。无论哪一届的大专毕业生，决不是整齐划一地从属于一个阶级的。同一届学生各有各的阶级立场和政治观点，这就存在阶级对立，就有左中右。那些抹杀这个阶级界线的组织，决非无产阶级革命派，而势必是资产阶级势力所控制的团体。它与资产阶级的同学会又有何差异呢？
    行会主义，它把工人阶级分解为许多小团体，而把不同政治观点的各色人等纠集在一起。显然，它不利于革命的联合，而有利于敌人的各个击破；它不利于统一，而有利于别有用心的人制造混乱。在当前，它严重地障碍无产阶级的夺权斗争。无产阶级要实现自己的大联合，就一定要把行会主义打个落花流水。一切行会主义团体，都应解散。
    行会主义是资产阶级分裂工人阶级队伍的一种工具。在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派刮起一股反革命经济主义的妖风，行会主义的团体应运而生。他们一个团体拿一批经费，用一个组织名义领一笔款项。行会主义，拉拢一批人，排斥一批人；突出这一工种这一部分工人，排斥另一工种另一部分工人；排斥革命干部和革命知识分子。这恰恰合乎资产阶级的要求，这是一种反动的思潮。
    在国际工人运动史上，行会主义（即帮会主义）的组织，无一不是黄色工会这类组织。行会主义，强调某一工种的特殊利益，或对某一个问题的特殊要求，而一当资产阶级用某种物质利益去满足他们眼前的需求时，他们便跟着资产阶级跑去。只要能分得一杯羹，便把无产阶级的整体利益置之不顾。列宁说：“……把工人的行会利益看得高于阶级利益，无异是为了工人眼前的暂时的局部的利益，而牺牲全体工人阶级的利益，牺牲工人阶级专政的利益。”行会主义从来就是资产阶级收买某些工贼，控制和破坏工人运动的一种手段。
    毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”显然，在阶级社会中，只有阶级的联合，没有超阶级的联合；不是无产阶级的联合，便是资产阶级的联合。行会主义，是机会主义思潮的表现。凡行会主义滋长的地方，它必然是反革命经济主义泛滥的地方。
    我们注意到，行会主义者正在打起“造反”的旗号，干着为狭隘私利奔走呼号的勾当。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命派，完全能够识破行会主义的实质，戳穿它，战胜它。让我们群起而攻之，搞臭行会主义！（新华社上海十四日电）
