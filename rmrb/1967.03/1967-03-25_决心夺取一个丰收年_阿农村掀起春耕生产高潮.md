Agricultural laborers across Albania, inspired by the call for further revolutionization by the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, are launching a vigorous spring plowing production campaign centered around grain production.

Many young people, women, and elderly individuals in Albania have written letters to their beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, expressing their determination to ensure a successful start to the spring plowing production. They have revised their production plans for this year, vowing to achieve another bountiful harvest on the foundation of last year's great success. This year, Albania's total agricultural output is expected to increase by 16% compared to last year, with grain production projected to rise by 10% and potato production by 57%.

To meet these targets, members of agricultural cooperatives, state farm workers, military farm soldiers, and state tractor station workers have decided, as the Party has taught, to transform themselves into revolutionaries and engage in a struggle against nature to increase grain and cotton yields. Since last winter, they have turned idle time into productive work. By the beginning of this spring, they have reclaimed over 19,700 hectares of land, exceeding the 1966-1967 annual reclamation plan by 13%.

To ensure a bountiful harvest and prevent summer droughts, Albania will expand irrigated land by approximately 10,000 hectares this year. In addition to the state constructing several large-scale water conservancy projects, many agricultural cooperatives are also self-reliant, having completed or actively building hundreds of small reservoirs, water storage ponds, and irrigation canals.

Currently, while leveling the land, agricultural laborers are also selecting seeds and conducting spring sowing. In coastal areas like Saranda and Lushnje, potato planting tasks have been completed or exceeded. On the fertile and beautiful Myzeqe Plain, some agricultural cooperatives have broken old habits by sowing early corn to extend the growing season and increase yield. In the colder southeastern Malakasari Plain, sugar beet sowing is proceeding rapidly. In the northern Shkodra mountains, people are cultivating tobacco and fruit tree seedlings.

Mountain farmers who have recently joined the cooperative movement are full of enthusiasm. Under the guidance of the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, they are filled with confidence in the socialist collective economy. With a spirit of self-reliance and overcoming all difficulties, they are welcoming the first spring production peak after collectivization.

Under the slogan "Agriculture is a national cause," relevant departments in the central government, workers from industrial and mining enterprises, People's Army units, and school youth are all actively supporting the current spring plowing production.

Relevant central departments have sent batches of political cadres and technical personnel to the countryside to lead the spring plowing and implement the Party's and Comrade Enver Hoxha's instructions on further revolutionization, fighting to build a new socialist countryside. Various agricultural machinery, pesticides, and small tools produced by units under the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture have been shipped to various locations. The first batch of nitrogen fertilizer produced by the Fieri Fertilizer Plant has reached the land of agricultural cooperatives. Workers, students, and urban residents are also using holidays and spare time to help cooperative members repair agricultural machinery and tools, build water conservancy projects, and participate in fieldwork. Additionally, many young people are rushing to rural areas to support the agricultural production frontline. Commercial, medical, and cultural workers are also going to the countryside to serve and perform for the spring plowing production.

### 决心夺取一个丰收年  阿农村掀起春耕生产高潮

    决心夺取一个丰收年
    阿农村掀起春耕生产高潮
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志提出的进一步革命化的号召的鼓舞下，正在掀起一个以粮食生产为中心的、热火朝天的春耕生产高潮。
    阿尔巴尼亚许多青年、妇女和老人纷纷写信给他们敬爱的领袖霍查同志，表示要保证打响春耕生产的第一炮。他们重新修订了今年度的生产计划，决心在去年大丰收的基础上，誓夺又一个丰收年。今年，阿尔巴尼亚的农业总产量预计将比去年增长百分之十六，粮食总产量将比去年增产百分之十，土豆产量将比去年增长百分之五十七。
    为了达到这些指标，广大农业合作社社员、国营农场工人、军垦农场战士和国营拖拉机站工人提出首先要象党所教导的那样，把自己变成革命者，同大自然展开争粮夺棉的斗争。早从去冬以来，他们就把冬闲变成了冬忙。到今年开春以前，他们共开荒一万九千七百多公顷，已经超额百分之十三完成了一九六六——一九六七年度全年开荒计划。
    为了争取农业丰收，防止夏季干旱，阿尔巴尼亚今年将扩大水浇地一万公顷左右。除了国家将建成一些大型水利工程以外，许多农业合作社还自力更生，已经建成或正在积极兴修几百个小型水库、蓄水池和引水渠。
    目前，广大农业劳动者在平整土地的同时，一面加紧选种，一面进行春播。阿尔巴尼亚沿海萨兰达、卢什涅等区，土豆栽培任务已经完成和超额完成。在富饶美丽的米泽克平原上，有些农业合作社为了延长玉米的生长期，提高产量，打破了往年的老习惯，提前播种了早玉米。在气候较寒冷的东南部马利克平原上、甜菜的播种工作也正在紧张地进行。在北方斯库台山区、人们正在为烟草和果树培苗育秧。
    刚刚走上合作化道路的山区农民，生产热情十分高涨。他们在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会决议的光辉照耀下，怀着对社会主义集体经济的无限信心，以自力更生、排除万难的精神，迎接着合作化后的第一个春季生产高潮。
    在“农业是全民的事业”的口号下，中央各有关部门、工矿企业的职工、人民军部队和学校青年也正在大力支援当前的春耕生产。
    中央有关部门派遣了大批政治干部和技术人员下乡，一面领导春耕，一面贯彻劳动党和霍查同志关于进一步革命化的指示，为建设社会主义的新农村而斗争。工矿部和农业部所属各单位生产的各种农业机械、农药和小型农具也已陆续运往各地。费里氮肥厂生产的第一批氮肥送到了农业合作社的土地上。广大职工、学生和城市居民还利用假日和业余时间帮助农业合作社社员修理农业机械和农具，兴修水利和参加田间劳动。此外，许多地区的青年奔赴农村，支援农业生产第一线。商业、医务和文艺工作者也纷纷下乡，为春耕生产服务和演出。（附图片）
