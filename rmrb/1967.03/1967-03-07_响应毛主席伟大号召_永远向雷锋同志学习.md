	Responding to Chairman Mao's Great Call to Learn from Comrade Lei Feng Forever

	Today, March 5th, marks the fourth anniversary of the issuance of the call by our most beloved Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng." At this critical juncture of the mass struggle for power by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, revisiting Chairman Mao's great call has even greater significance.

	There are many aspects of Comrade Lei Feng that are worthy of our learning, but the most fundamental one is to learn from his ardent class sentiments, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to thoroughly break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to cleanse the filth from the depths of our souls, to bravely rebel against and overthrow the "self," and to become a new person of communism who is dedicated to the public good.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the souls of people, a revolution to break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness, a revolution to seize power from the capitalist roaders in authority and to seize the power of the "self" from people's minds. Our great leader Chairman Mao has called on the People's Liberation Army to actively support the broad masses of the left. How can we truly support the revolutionary factions of the proletariat? It is to stand firmly on the correct side, to distinguish between friends and enemies, and to be "warm as spring to comrades, hot as summer to work, sweep away selfishness like autumn winds, and be as cruel as winter to enemies." Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." Only by seizing the power of the "self" from our minds and establishing a worldview of the proletariat that is dedicated to the public good, to the revolution, and to the people, can we truly support the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in their struggle for power. I deeply feel that with a public-minded heart, one's stance will be firm; with selfishness, one will waver; with a public-minded heart, one can distinguish right from wrong; with selfishness, one will confuse friends and enemies; with a public-minded heart, one will dare to take the lead; with selfishness, one will be afraid. In a word, only by learning from Comrade Lei Feng to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the class struggle, by taking Chairman Mao's works as our "compass," can we clear away the fog, see through everything, and firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. With fiery passion and high morale, we can most resolutely and forcefully support the revolutionary factions of the proletariat. In the struggle for power by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat against the handful of capitalist roaders in authority within the Party, we can establish new merits for the people.

	After the revolutionary factions of the proletariat seize power, they must also wield and use power well. We revolutionary fighters must support the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in wielding and using power well. The most important thing is to continuously study Chairman Mao's works and strengthen our ideological revolutionization, so that the "public" can fully seize power in our minds. In this way, we can remember Chairman Mao's teachings, stand firmly with all the people of China and all the revolutionary people of the world, think what the people think, and be concerned about what the people are concerned about, and "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, defending the iron-clad mountains and rivers of the proletariat.

	Learning from Mao Zedong Thought is a requirement of the times and a need of the revolution. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can grasp the grand direction of the struggle and stand unshakably. In this severe class struggle, I am determined, like Comrade Lei Feng, to never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to take the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" as my guiding principles, to seize the power of the "self" and rebel against the "self," and to build a new world of Mao Zedong Thought in my mind.

### 响应毛主席伟大号召  永远向雷锋同志学习

    响应毛主席伟大号召  永远向雷锋同志学习廖初江
    今年三月五日，是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席“向雷锋同志学习”题词发表四周年。在当前无产阶级革命派大联合进行夺权斗争的关键时刻，重温毛主席这一伟大号召，具有更加重大的意义。
    雷锋同志值得我们学习的地方很多，千条万条，最根本的一条，就是要学习他怀着最强烈的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，彻底破私立公，荡涤灵魂深处的污泥浊水，勇于造“私”字的反，革“私”字的命，做一个一心为公的共产主义新人。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，是一场破私立公的大革命，是一场夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，也夺人们头脑里“私”字的权的大革命。伟大领袖毛主席号召人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。怎样才能做到真正支持无产阶级革命派呢？就是要象雷锋同志那样站稳立场，分清敌我，做到“对待同志要象春天般的温暖，对待工作要象夏天一样的火热，对待个人主义要象秋风扫落叶一样，对待敌人要象严冬一样残酷无情”。毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”只有夺头脑里“私”字的权，树立一心为公，一心为革命，一心为人民的无产阶级世界观，才能真正地支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。我深深地体会到，一心为公，就会立场坚定，有了私心，就会左右摇摆；一心为公，就能分清是非，有了私心，就会敌我不分；一心为公，就会敢字当头，有了私心，就会怕字当头。一句话，只有象雷锋同志那样，在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席著作当作“方向盘”，才能拨开迷雾，洞察一切，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，以火一般的热情，高昂的斗志，最坚决最有力地支持无产阶级革命派，才能在无产阶级革命派大联合向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中，为人民建立新的功勋。
    无产阶级革命派夺权后，还要掌好权用好权。我们革命战士要支持无产阶级革命派掌好权用好权，最重要的就是要不断学习毛主席著作，加强思想革命化，让“公”字在我们头脑里百分之百的掌权。这样，我们就能牢记毛主席的教导，和全中国人民、全世界革命人民紧紧地站在一起，想人民所想，急人民所急，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，保卫无产阶级的铁打江山。
    学习毛泽东思想，这是时代的要求，是革命的需要。有了毛泽东思想，我们就能掌握斗争的大方向，就能永远立于不败之地。在这个严峻的阶级斗争中，我决心象雷锋同志那样，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》作为座右铭，夺“私”字的权，造“私”字的反，在头脑里打出一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想新世界。
