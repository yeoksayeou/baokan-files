A female student named Halima from a normal school in Somalia began studying Chairman Mao's works three months ago. Due to her diligence and hard work, although the time was short, she has already finished reading the fourth volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

One day, she wore a shining Mao Zedong badge on her chest and, together with her companions, spoke to a reporter about her experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. At the beginning, Halima fluently recited several quotations from Chairman Mao about how imperialism is a paper tiger. Then, she said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader in the world. No one else in the world can analyze the essence of imperialist reactionaries as thoroughly as Chairman Mao. Three months of studying Chairman Mao's works have made me understand many truths. For this reason, in the past three months, I have spent all my spare time studying Chairman Mao's works."

    读了宝书心开窍
    索马里一个师范学校的女学生哈里玛，是在三个月前开始学习毛主席著作的。由于她勤奋努力，时间虽然不长，却已读完了《毛泽东选集》第四卷和《毛主席语录》。
    有一天，她胸前佩戴着金灿灿的毛主席像章和她的同伴一起向记者畅谈了读毛主席著作的体会。一开始，哈里玛就非常流畅地背诵了毛主席关于帝国主义是纸老虎的几段语录。接着，她说：“毛主席是世界上最伟大的领袖，世界上还没有任何别的人能够把帝国主义反动派的本质分析得这样透彻。三个月的毛主席著作的学习，使我明白了许多道理。正因为如此，三个月来，我把全部业余时间都用在毛主席著作的学习上面了。”
