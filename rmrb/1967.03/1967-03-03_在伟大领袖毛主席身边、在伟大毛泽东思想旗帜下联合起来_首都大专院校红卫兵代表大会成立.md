The Great Leader Chairman Mao's side, under the banner of the great thought of Mao Zedong, unite!
The Capital Higher Education Institutions Red Guards Representative Conference is established

More than ten thousand Red Guards representatives solemnly gathered to pass the conference declaration, a letter of respect to Chairman Mao, and a letter to the Red Guards nationwide, vowing to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, warmly congratulated the Red Guards on their great unity, great solidarity, and great rally. Comrades Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and Jiang Qing also spoke at the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, February 2, reported: The Capital Higher Education Institutions Red Guards Representative Conference (Red Guards Conference) was established on February 22. On this day, more than ten thousand Red Guards representatives solemnly gathered in the magnificent Great Hall of the People, declaring: Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, in the heart of the great motherland—the birthplace of the Red Guards movement, the revolutionary factions of the three Red Guards headquarters in the capital have united, the Red Guards of the capital's higher education institutions have united, and under the banner of the great thought of Mao Zedong, they have triumphantly rallied! This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and it is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, representing the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, attended the conference to warmly congratulate the Red Guards of the capital's higher education institutions on their great unity, great solidarity, and great rally. Comrade Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the conference, "Your great unity is based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. I believe that your great unity will be increasingly consolidated, and you will unite, fight, and win together. I believe that your unity will influence the revolutionary youngsters in middle schools, and they will also unite like you under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. We believe that your great unity will promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Beijing, and they will successfully carry out the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary factions." Comrade Zhou Enlai emphasized, "Chairman Mao personally discovered the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country and approved its publication nationwide and worldwide. This is the first shot of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has entered a new stage of power struggle. The Shanghai working class took the lead and issued an emergency notice, opposing economism. It was again the great leader Chairman Mao who discovered it and decided to publish it. This is the second shot. At this critical moment, the proletarian revolutionary factions must resolutely respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, unite, and strive for new and greater victories!"

Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and an advisor to the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Xiao Jinguang, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Comrade Jiang Qing, the first deputy head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, as well as members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group such as Wang Li, Guan Feng, and Chen Boda, also attended the conference to congratulate. Comrades Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and Jiang Qing also spoke at the conference.

The Great Hall of the People was filled with vigorous revolutionary spirit and a fighting atmosphere. A large color portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hung in the center of the stage. The giant banners in the venue read: "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!" "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!" Before the conference, the Red Guards representatives sang the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations in unison and read Chairman Mao's quotations together.

The conference began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red," followed by more than ten thousand Red Guards warriors studying Chairman Mao's teachings together: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise the issue and recognize the issue in this way now, we will make a great mistake." "The world belongs to you, and it also belongs to us, but in the end, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in the prime of your lives, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Hope is placed on you.... The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you." "You should pay attention to national affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!"

The Red Guards are a necessary product of the new stage of socialist revolution in our country and a great creation of the international communist movement in the 1960s. This new thing with strong vitality, which has just appeared on the eastern horizon, has received the warm care and great support of our great leader Chairman Mao since its birth. From the day of its birth, the Red Guards, with their fearless revolutionary spirit, have risen to fight and become the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The heroic Red Guards, with the powerful proletarian revolutionary army, peasants, and workers as the main force and under their firm support and close cooperation, have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly smash the "four olds" of the exploiting class and establish the "four news" of the proletariat, severely strike the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and resolutely oppose the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, making immortal contributions to the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in our country. Under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Red Guards, as the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army, have continued to grow and become a vast cultural revolutionary army. Now, the representatives of the Red Guards of the capital's higher education institutions, with their hearts filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have gathered in the Great Hall of the People to celebrate their great unity, great solidarity, and great rally.

The conference passed the "Declaration of the Capital Higher Education Institutions Red Guards Representative Conference (Red Guards Conference)," solemnly proclaiming:

Our supreme commander is our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.
Our supreme headquarters is the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao.
Our guiding ideology is the great and invincible thought of Mao Zedong.
Our organizational principle is democratic centralism.
Our Red Guards consist mainly of revolutionary students from the families of the working people (workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and other laborers). Students from non-working-class families who have deep feelings for Chairman Mao, have the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and have consistently shown good political and ideological performance can also participate.
We will resolutely implement the class line of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, distinguish between enemies and friends, firmly rely on the revolutionary left, win over the middle forces, unite the majority, and thoroughly isolate and strike the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and the most reactionary rightists of the bourgeoisie.
Our conference is the highest authority of the Red Guards of the capital's higher education institutions. During the intermission of the conference, a committee will be established as a standing working body. We must forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make our organization a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.
Our conference will firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly smash the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, take the "Sixteen Articles" as the guideline, and strive to complete the great historical task of "one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms"!

The representatives of the original First Headquarters, Second Headquarters Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station, and Third Headquarters of the Capital Higher Education Institutions Red Guards, as well as the representatives of the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, spoke at the conference. They expressed their boundless excitement and respectfully wished the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! They enthusiastically hailed the battle rally of the Red Guards of the capital's higher education institutions under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They pointed out: The convening of the Capital Higher Education Institutions Red Guards Representative Conference is a brilliant starting point, but this is only the first step of a long march. To shoulder heavier responsibilities and face more arduous tasks, we must be humble and modest, resolutely and unconditionally follow Chairman Mao's instructions, learn from the People's Liberation Army, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp the transformation of world outlook, and strive to improve revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, to build a truly proletarian revolutionary and fighting Red Guards force, and to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

The representatives of the workers, peasants, and the People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison also spoke at the conference, warmly congratulating the convening of the Capital Higher Education Institutions Red Guards Representative Conference and congratulating the Red Guards for their contribution to the great unity of the revolutionary factions in the capital. They expressed their determination to be the strong backing of the Red Guards, fight side by side with the Red Guards, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution that shakes the world to the end. Comrade Liu Shaowen, the third political commissar of the Beijing Garrison, speaking on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison, emphasized: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the instructions of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, firmly stand with the proletarian revolutionary factions, concentrate our efforts to strike the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and resolutely implement proletarian dictatorship on those who sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, sabotage production, and sabotage the struggle for united power by the proletariat!

The conference, in the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" passed the letter of respect to Chairman Mao (see page two). More than ten thousand Red Guards representatives present also solemnly swore an oath of honor as Red Guards. The oath said: "We vow to be forever loyal to the proletariat! Forever loyal to Chairman Mao! Forever loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! We will dedicate all our energy and our entire lives to the most magnificent cause of humanity—communism! To the people, we will be infinitely loyal! To the enemies, we will have deep hatred! Live to fight for the party's cause! Die to sacrifice for the people's interests! 'For the sake of great ambitions, dare to make the sun and moon change the sky.' We absolutely guarantee to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, even if it means going through fire and water, we will use our blood and lives to defend Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao, we are infinitely loyal to you—resolutely following you, we will carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!"

The conference also passed the "Letter to the Red Guards Nationwide" (see page two).

The representative of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters attended the conference to warmly congratulate. He said: Beijing is the place where the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, resides, and it is the center of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The people of the whole country are watching the capital. The Red Guards of the capital unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which will be a great impetus for the proletarian revolutionary factions nationwide to unite, and the proletarian revolutionary factions nationwide will be greatly encouraged.

The conference also received many congratulatory letters and telegrams from the proletarian revolutionary factions in the capital and various places nationwide.

The conference read the congratulatory letter from the "White-Red Army—Yan'an" Rebel Group composed of foreign friends in Beijing. The Red Guards representatives responded with extremely enthusiastic applause to the congratulations from the international comrades.

Those attending the conference also included Beijing municipal leaders Wu De, Liu Jianxun, Fu Chongbi, Gao Yangwen, Ding Guoyi, and Li Qingquan.

The conference ended triumphantly with the majestic song "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman."

    在伟大领袖毛主席身边、在伟大毛泽东思想旗帜下联合起来
    首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会成立
    一万多名红卫兵代表隆重集会，通过红代会宣言、给毛主席致敬信和告全国红卫兵书，保证永远忠于毛主席，永远站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    周恩来同志代表毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志、党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组热烈祝贺红卫兵大联合、大团结、大会师。陈伯达、康生、江青同志在大会上讲了话。
    新华社二日讯　首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会（红代会），二月二十二日宣告成立。这一天，在雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂，一万多名红卫兵代表隆重集会，庄严宣告：在伟大领袖毛主席身边，在伟大祖国的心脏——红卫兵运动的发源地，首都红卫兵三个司令部的革命派联合起来了，首都大专院校的红卫兵团结起来了，在伟大毛泽东思想旗帜下胜利会师了！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的又一新胜利。
    中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志，代表伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组，到会热烈祝贺首都大专院校红卫兵实现大联合、大团结、大会师。周恩来同志在大会上讲话说，你们这次大联合是在马列主义、毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来、团结起来的。我相信你们的这个大联合是会日益巩固的，是会团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起的。我相信你们的联合会影响中学的革命小将们，他们也会和你们一样，在毛泽东思想指引下，实行象你们这样的大联合。我们相信，你们的大联合会推动北京市无产阶级革命派的大联合，胜利地进行无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。周恩来同志强调指出：毛主席亲自发现全国第一张马列主义的大字报并且批准把它公布于全国和全世界，这是无产阶级文化大革命的第一声号炮。无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的新阶段，上海工人阶级带头起来，发出紧急通告，反对经济主义。又是伟大领袖毛主席发现，并且决定登报，这是第二声号炮。在这个关键时刻，无产阶级革命派要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，联合起来，团结起来，去争取新的更大的胜利！
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组组长陈伯达同志，中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组顾问康生同志，中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理谢富治同志，中央文革小组第一副组长江青同志，以及中央文革小组成员王力、关锋、戚本禹同志等，也到会祝贺。陈伯达、康生、江青同志还在大会上先后讲了话。
    人民大会堂里，充满了蓬勃的革命朝气和昂扬的战斗气氛。伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅彩色画像，悬挂在主席台中央。会场上的巨幅标语有：“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”会前，红卫兵代表们齐声高唱毛主席语录歌，集体朗读毛主席语录。
    大会在《东方红》的雄壮乐曲声中开始，接着一万多名红卫兵战士一起学习毛主席的教导：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。……世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    红卫兵是我国社会主义革命新阶段的必然产物，是二十世纪六十年代国际共产主义运动中的伟大创举。红卫兵这一具有强大生命力的新生事物，刚刚从东方地平线上出现，就得到了我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和巨大支持。红卫兵从诞生那天起，就以其大无畏的革命精神奋起战斗，成为无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋。英雄的红卫兵，在无产阶级文化大革命的强大的工农兵主力军的坚决支持和密切配合下，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大破剥削阶级的“四旧”，大立无产阶级的“四新”，痛击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，坚决反对资产阶级反动路线，为我国无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。在伟大毛泽东思想哺育下，作为人民解放军后备力量的红卫兵不断成长壮大，已经发展成为浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。现在，首都大专院校红卫兵的代表们，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的激动心情，聚集在人民大会堂，共庆他们的大联合、大团结、大会师。
    大会通过的《首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会（红代会）宣言》庄严地宣告：
    我们的最高统帅是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。
    我们的最高司令部是以毛主席为首的党中央。
    我们的指导思想是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    我们的组织原则是民主集中制。
    我们红卫兵以劳动人民家庭（工、农、兵、革命干部和其他劳动者）出身的革命学生为主体。非劳动人民家庭出身的学生，对毛主席有深厚感情，有无产阶级的革命精神，一贯在政治思想上表现比较好的，也可以参加。
    我们坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党的阶级路线，分清敌我友，坚决依靠革命的左派，争取中间派，团结大多数，彻底孤立和打击一小撮反革命修正主义分子和最反动的资产阶级右派分子。
    我们的代表大会是首都大专院校红卫兵的最高权力机构，在代表大会闭会期间，设立一个委员会，作为常设工作机构。我们一定要永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把我们的组织办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    我们的代表大会坚定不移地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，以十六条为纲，为胜利完成一斗二批三改的伟大历史任务而奋斗！
    原首都大专院校红卫兵第一司令部、第二司令部革命造反联络站和第三司令部的代表以及北京大学革命师生的代表，分别在大会上发了言。他们怀着无比激动的心情，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！他们热烈欢呼首都大专院校红卫兵在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下的战斗会师。他们指出：首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会的召开，是一个光辉的起点，但这只是万里长征的第一步。为了担起更重的担子，迎接更艰巨的任务，必须戒骄戒躁，坚决地不折不扣地照毛主席的指示办事，向解放军学习，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓世界观的改造，大力提高革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，为建立一支真正无产阶级革命化、战斗化的红卫兵队伍，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底而战斗！
    首都工人、农民的代表和人民解放军北京卫戍区的代表也先后在会上发言，热烈祝贺首都大专院校红卫兵代表大会的召开，祝贺红卫兵为首都革命派大联合作出了贡献。他们表示，坚决做红卫兵的坚强后盾，同红卫兵并肩战斗，共同把这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。人民解放军北京卫戍区第三政委刘绍文代表北京卫戍区全体指战员发言时，强调说：我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行最高统帅毛主席的指示，坚定不移地同无产阶级革命派站在一起，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，谁要破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏生产，破坏无产阶级联合夺权的斗争，就坚决对他们实行无产阶级专政！
    大会在“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声中，通过了给毛主席的致敬信（见第二版）。到会的一万多名红卫兵代表，还以红卫兵的荣誉庄严宣誓。誓词中说：“我们保证永远忠于无产阶级！永远忠于毛主席！永远忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！我们要把全部精力和整个生命献给人类最壮丽的事业——共产主义！对人民，我们要无限忠诚！对敌人，我们要刻骨仇恨！生，为党的事业而战斗！死，为人民的利益而献身！‘为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。’我们绝对保证站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，那怕是上刀山、下火海，我们也要用鲜血和生命誓死保卫毛主席！毛主席，我们无限忠于您——坚决跟着您老人家，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    大会还通过了《告全国红卫兵书》（见第二版）。
    山西革命造反总指挥部代表到会热烈祝贺。他说：北京是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席居住的地方，是无产阶级文化大革命的中心，全国人民都注视着首都。首都红卫兵在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下实行大联合，这对于全国各地的无产阶级革命派实行大联合，将是一个巨大的推动，全国各地的无产阶级革命派都将感到欢欣鼓舞。
    大会还收到了首都和全国各地无产阶级革命派发来的许多贺信、贺电。
