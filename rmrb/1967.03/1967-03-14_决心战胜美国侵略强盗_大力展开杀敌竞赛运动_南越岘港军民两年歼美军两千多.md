The military and civilians of the city of Da Nang in the southern part of Vietnam have, over the past two years, bravely fought in the stronghold of the American aggressors, continuously striking the enemy and achieving the glorious result of annihilating and demoralizing 3,125 enemy personnel, including 2,639 American aggressors.

During this period, the military and civilians of Da Nang city also destroyed and shot down 240 various types of American aircraft, destroyed 190 tanks, armored vehicles, and other military vehicles, blew up 14 cannons, 5 missile launchers, and 3 military trains, and burned 60 million liters of gasoline.

Over the past two years, the military and civilians of Da Nang city have vigorously launched the "Find the Americans to Annihilate, Find the Puppet Soldiers to Fight" kill-the-enemy competition. A total of 255 people have been awarded the titles of combat model, American-killing hero, aircraft-shooting hero, vehicle-shooting hero, and decisive victory hero for their outstanding achievements in battle. Many liberation armed forces units that have distinguished themselves in annihilating the enemy have also been awarded the glorious title of bravely annihilating the Americans.

Recently, representatives attending the Da Nang city combat model and American-killing hero conference sent a telegram to the military and civilians of Hanoi and Haiphong in northern Vietnam, reporting the above-mentioned glorious achievements. The telegram also expressed that the fraternal bond between the military and civilians of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Da Nang has been transformed into concrete actions: Da Nang calls, Haiphong responds; Hanoi calls, Da Nang advances bravely, giving the American aggressors the punishment they deserve.

The telegram said: "We will compete with you to achieve greater victories in 1967 and resolutely defeat the American aggressors, liberate the south, defend the north, and ultimately reunify the country, so that the people of Hanoi, Haiphong, and Da Nang can reunite."

    决心战胜美国侵略强盗　大力展开杀敌竞赛运动
    南越岘港军民两年歼美军两千多
    新华社河内十三日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广南省岘港市军民，两年来英勇奋战，不断在美国侵略强盗的巢穴里痛击敌人，取得了消灭和瓦解敌人三千一百二十五名的辉煌战果，其中消灭和瓦解美国侵略军二千六百三十九名。
    在这期间，岘港市军民还炸毁和击落各种类型美国飞机二百四十架，击毁坦克、装甲车和其它军车一百九十辆，炸毁大炮十四门、导弹发射台五座和军用列车三列，烧毁汽油六千万公升。
    在过去两年里，岘港市军民大力开展“找美国佬歼，找伪军打”的杀敌竞赛运动，有二百五十五人由于在战斗中立下了优异的战功，分别被授予战斗模范、歼美勇士、打飞机勇士、打军车勇士、决胜勇士等光荣称号。杀敌有功的许多解放武装力量单位也荣获了英勇歼美的光荣称号。
    最近出席岘港市战斗模范、歼美勇士大会的代表们，在打给越南北方河内和海防两个城市的军民的电报中报告了上述辉煌战绩。电报还表示，河内、海防和岘港军民的骨肉团结情谊，已经化为实际行动：岘港呼唤，海防响应；河内呼唤，岘港奋勇向前，给美国侵略强盗以应得的惩罚。
    电报说：“我们同你们展开竞赛，决心在一九六七年夺取更大的胜利，并且决心彻底战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国，使河内、海防和岘港人民能够欢聚一堂。”
