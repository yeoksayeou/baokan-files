Not long ago, on the stormy waves of the East China Sea, a fishing boat caught fire by accident. The flames were the signal. The soldiers and civilians on the island, along with the Red Guards, rushed towards the fire from all directions and fearlessly joined the battle to extinguish it. After a fierce struggle, the fire was put out. The entire island's military and civilian population then busied themselves saving the frostbitten comrades, filling the air with the warmth of a revolutionary family. In this battle, the island's military and civilian population, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, composed another heroic anthem.

A red sun rose from the east, casting its golden rays over the tumultuous East China Sea. This red sun is our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao; these dazzling golden rays are the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, the military and civilian population of an island in the frontline of the East China Sea have recently composed another heroic anthem!

On the night of December 27 last year, this frontline island, like any other night, was filled with people eagerly studying the works of Chairman Mao. Around nine o'clock in the evening, the fishermen boarded their boats, ready to set sail. At that time, a strong wind of seven to eight levels was blowing, and the weather was extremely cold. The diesel fuel had frozen, making it difficult to start the engine. The engineer of the New Display No. 4 fishing boat used fire to thaw the oil pipe, accidentally causing a fire that ignited the accumulated oil at the bottom of the engine room. Although the fishermen tried their best to extinguish the fire, the flames grew more intense, illuminating the surrounding area like daylight. The flames were the signal; the flames were the command. The sentry soldier Wang Jinquan, upon seeing the fire, immediately reported it to the island's garrison. The entire island buzzed with activity. Soldiers, civilians, and Red Guards quickly rushed towards the fire from all directions.

A tense and fierce battle began. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army fearlessly took the lead, boarding the fishing boat to fight the flames. Instantly, on the shore, at sea, and on the boat, military and civilian personnel formed four iron transport lines, continuously carrying sand from the shore into the engine room.

The comrades fighting on the boat were fearless of the thick smoke and fierce flames; the comrades fighting in the sea paid no heed to the wind and waves, the bone-chilling cold; the comrades fighting on the shore were tireless, racing against time to pass buckets of sand.

The battle raged on. Suddenly, the oil pipe exploded, and diesel fuel flowed out, making the fire even more intense. With the northwest wind, the flames danced in the air, and the 4,000-plus pounds of diesel fuel on the boat was in imminent danger of igniting. The safety of the seven nearby fishing boats was seriously threatened.

In this critical moment, the soldiers rushed to the most dangerous spots and charged into the most crucial areas. The Communist Party member and Five Good Soldier Dai Weiliang, fighting at the engine room hatch, had his eyebrows singed and his hair sizzling from the heat. Enduring the pain, he accurately poured bucket after bucket of sand into the engine room. Due to prolonged exposure to the intense heat and thick smoke, his strength gradually waned, and he suddenly blacked out, falling into the sea. The deputy squad leader Zhang Xuecai quickly grabbed him. Dai Weiliang regained consciousness and, with his last ounce of strength, charged back into the flames. He fell and got back up, always fighting at the most dangerous and critical spot, the engine room hatch.

The raging flames spread in all directions. The exhaust pipe was red-hot, and parts of the machinery were damaged. The 2,000-plus pounds of diesel fuel in the tank made a popping sound. Experienced fishermen realized this was a very dangerous sign. They quickly pushed the soldiers back and urgently shouted, "Get out of here quickly! The fuel tank is about to explode!"

If the fuel tank exploded, the lives of over 300 people around the fishing boat and the village just a few dozen meters away would be in grave danger. At this critical moment, the only way to save the situation was to extinguish the fire before the fuel tank exploded. Deputy Platoon Leader Wu Shuixiang firmly and calmly made a resolute vow: "Communist Party members and Young Pioneers should charge into the fray, hold their positions, carry sand, and definitely extinguish the fire!" The deputy platoon leader spoke for everyone's heart. Instantly, the soldiers, civilians, militiamen, and Red Guards on the boat, at sea, and on the shore, spontaneously shouted in unison, "Determine to struggle, be unafraid of sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." This voice, wave after wave, was the source of strength and the signal of victory. At this life-or-death moment, people armed with Mao Zedong Thought did not falter or retreat. Everyone bravely moved forward, standing firmly in the most dangerous places, fighting stronger and stronger. The Communist Party member and Five Good Soldier Tang Yungen stood in seawater up to his neck, freezing almost to the point of fainting. Hearing that the fuel tank was about to explode, with a fearless revolutionary spirit, he bravely grabbed the side of the boat and climbed aboard. His limbs were frozen and uncooperative, and he suddenly fell back into the sea, swallowing several mouthfuls of seawater, choking and dizzying him. He steadied himself, stood up firmly, picked up a basin, and continued the fight. When he collapsed again, his hands still held the basin, as if offering a red heart to the people.

People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the entire island's military and civilian population displayed boundless wisdom and strength. They carried over ten tons of sand into the ship's hold, extinguishing the fire. A serious accident that threatened the lives and property of the island's people was averted. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. This is the result of the entire island's military and civilian population studying and applying the "Three Articles."

The fire was extinguished, and the entire island's military and civilian population busied themselves saving the frostbitten comrades.

The deep class feelings and combat camaraderie fostered among military personnel and civilians, cadres, and soldiers in the study and application of the "Three Articles" gave the frostbitten comrades immense encouragement and strength. The soldiers, emerging from the icy sea, were immediately surrounded by civilians, militiamen, and Red Guards. They carried and supported each other, some taking off their warm cotton jackets to wrap around the soldiers, others tightly wrapping blankets around them. Civilians supported soldiers, soldiers supported civilians, and lightly injured supported the seriously injured.

The East China Sea is deep, but the bond between the island's military and civilian population is deeper. The civilians took some of the soldiers home, offering them hot water and tea, some cooking egg soup, others buying wine. They gave the soldiers their best quilts. Some lively children took off their cotton clothes, insisting on giving them to the soldiers. The civilians visiting the frostbitten soldiers surrounded them in layers, their hearts beating with the soldiers, their eyes watching over them. By the side of soldier Tang Yungen, an old woman extended her warm hands, stroking his frozen limbs, tears of joy streaming down her face as she took off her warm cotton jacket and wrapped it tightly around Tang Yungen's chest, covering him with a quilt. A surge of class warmth filled the soldiers' hearts. Tang Yungen was moved to tears.

The people love the soldiers, and the soldiers love the people even more. As soon as the fire was extinguished, the soldiers first thought of the island's people. They cooked hot soup, not bothering to change their muddy clothes, and carried the soup throughout the island's fishing village, delivering bowl after bowl of steaming hot soup to the hands of the poor and lower-middle-class peasants.

In times of difficulty, revolutionary soldiers first think of others. Cadres and soldiers care for, love, and help each other, filling the air with the warmth of a revolutionary family.

It was deep into the night, but many comrades were still awake. Cadres visited soldiers, and soldiers visited cadres. Some gave their quilts and coats to the seriously injured, others spoon-fed hot soup to their comrades, some competed to wash their comrades' clothes, others competed to stand guard. The Communist Party member and squad leader Xie Liangxun, after returning from the fire, had just changed out of his wet clothes. Thinking of the enemy and the need for his comrades to rest, he stood guard with his rifle from midnight until dawn, protecting the people of the motherland.

    “公”字当头的人们
     ——记东海前线某岛军民英勇抢救失火渔船的事迹
    不久以前，在波涛汹涌的东海上，一艘渔船不慎失火。火光就是命令。驻海岛部队指战员、社员、红卫兵，立即从四面八方冲向火光，奋不顾身地投入了灭火的战斗。经过一场激战，大火扑灭了。全岛军民又为救护冻伤的阶级兄弟而奔忙，处处充满了革命大家庭的温暖。在这场战斗中，用毛泽东思想哺育的海岛军民，又谱写出了一支英雄集体的凯歌。
    一轮红日从东方升起，发出万道金光，照耀着波涛汹涌的东海。这红太阳就是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席；这灿烂夺目的金光，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的照耀下，不久前，东海前线一个渔岛的军民，又谱写出了一支英雄集体的凯歌！
    去年十二月二十七日夜晚，这个前沿小岛也和往常一样，人们正在如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。晚上九时许，渔民们纷纷登上渔船，准备出海。这时正刮着七八级大风，气候严寒。柴油冻结了，马达很难发动，新展四号渔船的轮机员，用火烤输油管，不慎失火，引起机舱底部积油燃烧。渔民们虽奋力抢救，但火势却越来越猛，火光将附近照得如同白昼。火光就是信号，火光就是命令。正在执勤的战士王金泉，发现火光，立即向驻岛部队作了报告。整个海岛沸腾起来了。解放军战士、社员、红卫兵，迅速从四面八方向火光冲去。
    一场紧张而激烈的战斗开始了。解放军战士奋不顾身，带头登上渔船，与烈火搏斗。顿时，岸上、海上、船上，军民一起结成了四条钢铁运输线，将岸上的泥沙源源地不断运进机舱。
    战斗在渔船上的同志们，不怕浓烟烈火；战斗在大海里的同志们，不管风吹浪打，寒冷彻骨；战斗在岸上的同志们，不怕疲劳，争分夺秒地传土箕装泥沙。
    战斗在紧张地进行着。突然，油管爆炸了，柴油不断外流，火势更大更猛。随着阵阵西北风，火焰在空中翻腾，船上四千多斤柴油随时都有被引燃的危险，附近七条渔船的安全受到了严重威胁。
    战士们在这紧急关头，哪里最危险，就往哪里冲，哪里最关键，就往哪里闯。战斗在机舱口的共产党员、五好战士戴维良，眉毛烤糊了，头发也烤得吱吱的响，他忍受着疼痛，把一盆盆、一筐筐泥沙，准确地倒向机舱。由于长时间受烈火烤，浓烟熏，他的体力渐渐支持不住，忽然眼前一黑，身不由己地向大海倒去。在旁边的副班长张雪才，急忙一把把他抓住。戴维良刚苏醒过来，就用尽全身力气，再次冲向烈火。跌倒了，又爬起来，始终坚持战斗在最危险最紧要的机舱口。
    熊熊的烈火在向四处蔓延。排气管被烧得通红，机器上的部分机件也烧坏了，油箱里的两千多斤柴油，发出突突突的响声。有经验的渔民意识到这是一个非常危险的信号。他们连忙把战士向后一推，急促地大声喊道：“快点走开！油箱就要爆炸了！”
    如果油箱爆炸，渔船周围的三百多人的生命和几十米外的一片村庄，就会遭受毁灭性的危险。在这千钧一发的时刻，唯一的办法就是要把大火扑灭在油箱爆炸之前。副连长吴水祥坚定、沉着地发出了赤胆忠心的誓言：“共产党员、共青团员要冲锋陷阵，坚守岗位，快运沙子，一定要扑灭大火！”副连长说出了大家的心里话。顿时，船上、海上、岸上的战士、社员、民兵和红卫兵，不约而同地高声朗读毛主席语录“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这声音，一浪高过一浪。这声音，就是力量的源泉，胜利的信号。在这生死关头，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人们，没有一个畏缩，没有一个后退。个个勇敢向前，坚定地站在最危险的地方，越战越强。共产党员、五好战士唐云根，站在齐脖深的海水里，冻得快要昏倒了，他听到油箱要爆炸，怀着大无畏的革命精神，挺身而出，一把抓住船帮，往船上爬。四肢冻得不听使唤了，忽然从船上掉到海里，接连灌了几口海水，呛得迷迷糊糊。他定定神，坚强地站起来，拿起脸盆，又继续战斗。当他再一次昏倒的时候，双手还捧着脸盆，就象捧着一颗红心献给人民。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人就是最大的战斗力。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，全岛军民发挥了无穷的智慧和力量，他们前后共把十多吨泥沙运进船舱，扑灭了大火。一场威胁到岛上人民生命财产安全的严重事故避免了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这是全岛军民活学活用“老三篇”的成果。
    大火扑灭了，全岛军民又为救护冻伤的阶级兄弟而忙碌着。
    军民之间、干部和战士之间在活学活用“老三篇”中培育起来的深厚的阶级感情和血肉相连的战斗友谊，给冻伤了的同志以巨大的鼓舞和力量。战士们从冰冷彻骨的海里走上来，社员、民兵和红卫兵就一拥而上，他们象战争年代抢救伤员一样，背的背，扶的扶，有的脱下带着体温的棉袄给战士披上，有的把棉被紧紧裹在战士身上。社员扶着战士，战士扶着社员，轻伤员扶着重伤员。
    东海深，哪有海岛军民情谊深。社员们把一部分战士接到家里，端热水倒热茶，有的给战士烧了鸡蛋汤，有的买来了烧酒。他们把最好的被子给战士盖上。一些天真活泼的孩子们，也脱下了棉衣，一定要给解放军叔叔穿。看望冻伤战士的社员围了一层又一层，多少颗心和人民战士紧紧相连，多少双眼睛在注视着他们。在战士唐云根身边，一个老大娘伸出温暖的手，抚摸着他冻僵的四肢，激动得一面流着热泪，一面脱下热烘烘的棉袄，紧紧裹在唐云根胸前，又把被子严严实实地给他盖上。一股阶级的暖流，温暖着战士的心。唐云根被感动得热泪盈眶。
    人民爱战士，战士更爱人民。火一扑灭，战士们首先想到的是岛上的人民。他们烧好辣汤，顾不得换下满身泥浆的衣服，就抬着辣汤跑遍岛上的整个渔村，把一碗碗热气腾腾的辣汤，送到贫下中农社员手中。
    在困难的时候，革命战士首先想到的是别人。干部战士互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，充满着革命大家庭的温暖。
    夜深了，许多同志还没有睡。干部看望战士，战士也看望干部。有的把自己的被子、大衣给重伤员盖上，有的一匙一匙的给同志们喂辣汤，有的在争着给同志们洗衣服，有的在争着站岗。共产党员、班长谢良勋，救火回来，刚换下一身湿漉漉的衣服，他想到敌人，他想到同志们更需要休息，就毫无倦意地端起冲锋枪走向哨位，为祖国人民从深夜十二点一直站岗到天明。
