The CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee member Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Kang Sheng held a banquet this evening to warmly welcome the General Secretary of the New Zealand Communist Party, Comrade V.J. Wilcox.

At the banquet filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, Comrades Zhou Enlai and Wilcox toasted. They proposed toasts: to the fighting friendship between the Communist Party of China and the New Zealand Communist Party, to the victory of Marxism-Leninism throughout the world, to the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and to the health of the great leader Chairman Mao.

Attending the banquet were Comrade Liu Ningyi, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, Comrade Zhao Yimin, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee, and Comrade Wang Li, member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and other comrades.

New Zealand Communist Party comrades in Beijing also attended the banquet.

After the banquet, Comrade Wilcox attended a cultural evening held in his honor, watching the modern revolutionary Beijing opera "The Red Lantern."

New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Comrade Wilcox, accompanied by CPC Central Committee Secretariat member Comrade Liu Ningyi, visited the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics this morning and was warmly welcomed by thousands of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the entire institute, including the Red Flag Combat Team.

At the grand welcoming rally held for the entire institute's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, Comrade Wilcox spoke. He said, Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He not only inherited Marxism-Leninism but also creatively developed Marxism-Leninism in the era of the final demise of imperialism. The New Zealand Communist Party recognizes that great Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism tested by practice. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guarantee for the victory of the Chinese revolution but also the guarantee for the victory of the world revolution.

Comrade Wilcox warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, you are conducting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which will ensure the victory of socialism, prevent revisionism, and prevent the restoration of capitalism. You are building a powerful socialist country, and in doing so, you are actually helping us in our struggle against imperialism in New Zealand.

Comrade Wilcox said, the New Zealand Communist Party and the Communist Party of China are fighting side by side in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership. China is building socialism and is a strong bastion against imperialism. The New Zealand Communist Party is also fighting against imperialism and striving for socialism. We are united with all progressive humanity around the world, shoulder to shoulder, marching towards a glorious future.

Comrade Wilcox's speech was met with thunderous applause from the entire audience. The audience repeatedly shouted: "Long live the fighting friendship between the Communist Party of China and the New Zealand Communist Party!" "Workers of the world, unite!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

At the welcoming rally, the warriors of the Red Flag Combat Team of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, amid cheers, presented Comrade Wilcox with Chairman Mao badges and Red Flag Combat Team armbands. The rally ended with everyone singing "The Internationale" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

Comrade Wilcox also had a cordial discussion with the warriors of the Red Flag Combat Team. Comrade Wilcox listened to the Red Flag warriors of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics introduce the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the institute and also read big-character posters.
