The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new and stern test for every cadre.

For the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink.

For cadres who have made mistakes, we follow Chairman Mao's instructions and adhere to the policy of "unity—criticism—unity."

Since the beginning of the movement, the revolutionary youngsters have leveled sharp and severe criticism at cadres who have made mistakes. Sometimes, they have "attacked" these cadres so fiercely that they "couldn't get off the stage." They are frank and straightforward, saying whatever they think without hesitation or concealment. Whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, they dare to criticize and rebel against. This revolutionary spirit is so precious and lovable!

However, some comrades who have been criticized still feel wronged. They think that the revolutionary youngsters have treated them "too ruthlessly"!

Is it really "too ruthless"? The revolutionary youngsters are indeed ruthless towards anything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. They rise up together to attack it. Some cadres, due to long-term detachment from the masses and reality, have become bureaucrats, and various non-proletarian thoughts have grown in their minds. In this movement, the revolutionary youngsters have fired at the various non-proletarian thoughts on them without mercy, shouted loudly, and slapped hard, helping them to deeply reflect. This is completely necessary and correct. If they were to be "gentle and affectionate," they would not be able to touch their hearts, and they would not be able to make them feel shocked.

The revolutionary youngsters criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the cadres so ruthlessly, precisely because they care for the cadres. They do this to help the cadres correct their mistakes, overcome their shortcomings, and closely follow Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary tide, not to knock the cadres down with one blow. The youngsters say: "We are not trying to knock you down, but to make you serve the people better." This sentence is full of revolutionary affection and is said so well!

"Ruthless but affectionate." In class society, affection has class characteristics. The proletariat has its own love and hate. The revolutionary youngsters care for revolutionary cadres, but are "ruthless" towards the various non-proletarian thoughts on them. It is precisely because of this care that they demand so strictly, and this "ruthlessness" is an expression of their affection for the revolutionary cadres.

    道是无情却有情 
    北京师范大学井冈山公社挺进兵
    无产阶级文化大革命，对于每一个干部都是一场新的严峻的考验。
    对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们必须把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    对犯有错误的干部，我们则是按照毛主席的教导，坚持“团结——批评——团结”的方针。
    运动以来，革命小将们对犯有错误的干部，提出了尖锐、严厉的批评，有时甚至“整”得这些干部“下不了台”。他们坦白、直率，有什么说什么，毫不吞吞吐吐，遮遮盖盖。凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，他们都敢批评，敢造反。这种革命精神，是何等的可贵可爱！
    但是，有些挨过批评的同志至今还感到委屈，他们认为，革命小将这样对待自己“太无情了”！
    真是“太无情了”么？革命小将对于一切不符合毛泽东思想的东西，深恶痛绝，群起而攻之，确确实实是无情的。有一些干部，由于长期以来脱离群众，脱离实际，做官当老爷，头脑中滋长了各种非无产阶级思想。在这次运动中，革命小将向他们身上的各种非无产阶级思想无情地“开火”，大喝一声，击一猛掌，帮助他们狠触灵魂，这是完全应该的，这是完全正确的。如果“温情脉脉”，就不能触痛他们，就不能使他们大吃一惊。
    革命小将们这样无情地批评干部身上的缺点错误，正是从爱护干部出发的。他们这样做，目的是为了帮助干部改正错误，克服缺点，紧紧跟上毛泽东思想，紧紧跟上革命潮流，决不是要把干部一棍子打死。小将们说：“我们不是为了把你们整下台，而是为了使你们更好地为人民服务。”这句话，充满着革命的深情，说得何等好啊！
    “道是无情却有情”。在阶级社会里，情是有阶级性的。无产阶级有自己的爱和憎。革命小将对革命干部是爱护的，对革命干部身上的各种非无产阶级思想则是“无情”的。正是出于爱护，他们才要求得那么严格，这种“无情”，正是对革命干部“有情”的表现。
