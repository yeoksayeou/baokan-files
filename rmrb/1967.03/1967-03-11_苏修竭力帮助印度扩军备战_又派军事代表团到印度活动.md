The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, is assisting the Indian reactionaries in military expansion and war preparation. Recently, it dispatched a military delegation led by the First Deputy Minister of the Soviet Defense Ministry and Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army and Navy, Zakharov, to India for activities.

According to reports from the Indian News Agency and Indian newspapers, Zakharov arrived in New Delhi on February 28 and held talks with Indian Defense Minister Singh and the chiefs of staff of the Indian armed forces. In the talks held on March 1 between Zakharov and the chiefs of staff of the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, they "specifically studied the quality of weapons delivered to India by the Soviet Union in recent years. The meeting also discussed various suggestions for modifications proposed by the Indian armed forces." On the day before Zakharov's departure from India to return to the Soviet Union, he held a final round of talks with the heads of the Indian Army and Air Force on March 7, "explaining his impressions of the various defensive (military) facilities he had visited during his stay in this country," providing advice and strategies for the Indian reactionaries' military expansion and war preparation.
