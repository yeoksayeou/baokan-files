The exploitation of Bolivia by American monopoly capital is a prime example of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Latin America.

In 1956, the South American Gold Corporation obtained the right to mine gold in 25,000 hectares of Bolivian land for a period of 25 years. Starting from 1959, this company plundered $500 million worth of gold in just five years, while the Bolivian government received only $1.5 million in compensation.

To seize villages for gold mining, the South American Gold Corporation dumped piles of waste, rocks, and mine tailings into small rivers, causing them to change course. Residents, fearing inundation, were forced to abandon their villages.

Workers employed by the South American Gold Corporation in Bolivia were not allowed to join unions, and if they did, they would be fired by the company. Their wages were extremely low. Many workers contracted lung diseases, had no money for treatment, and spread the diseases to their families and neighbors.

Recently, the American Gulf Oil Company seized 1.5 million hectares of oil concession land in Bolivia. This region holds 197 million barrels of oil, which is tens of times more than the reserves controlled by Bolivia's state-owned oil enterprises. The American Gulf Oil Company also seized a large amount of natural gas.

Recently, the Bolivian military dictatorship leased the world's largest zinc mine, Bolivia's "Matilde" mine, to the American Phillips Brothers Company. The "Matilde" mine contains large amounts of iron, lead, and other strategically important metals such as cadmium.

    美国吸血鬼在玻利维亚
    美国垄断资本对玻利维亚的掠夺，是美帝国主义侵略拉丁美洲的一个例子。
    美国垄断资本南美砂金公司在一九五六年取得在玻利维亚的二万五千公顷土地上开采金矿二十五年的权利。从一九五九年起，这家公司在五年之中掠夺了价达五亿美元的黄金，而玻利维亚政府只得到一百五十万美元偿金。
    南美砂金公司为了霸占村庄开采金矿，把成堆的废料、石块、矿渣倾倒在小河里，使小河改道，居民为了不被淹没，就只好撤离村庄。
    南美砂金公司雇用的玻利维亚工人不能参加工会，否则就会被公司开除。他们的待遇极为菲薄。不少工人患了肺病，没有钱治疗，把病传染给了他们的家属和邻居。
    不久以前，美国海湾石油公司在玻利维亚霸占了一百五十万公顷的石油租让地，这片地区的石油蕴藏量达一亿九千七百万桶，比玻利维亚国营石油企业掌握的蕴藏量多十几倍。美国海湾石油公司还霸占了大量的天然气。
    最近，玻利维亚军事独裁政府又把世界上最大的锌矿之一、玻利维亚的“马蒂尔德”矿租让给美国菲利普斯兄弟公司。“马蒂尔德”矿蕴藏着大量铁、铅和重要战略物资镉等贵重金属。
