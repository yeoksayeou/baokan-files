The people and military of South Vietnam are growing stronger in battle. The situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield is excellent. Military and civilians in various regions have won numerous victories this year, repeatedly foiling U.S. military "sweeping operations," and annihilating more than ten thousand enemy troops.

Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: Our correspondent reports that since the beginning of this year, victory reports have been frequently transmitted from various battlefields in South Vietnam. The brave and skilled people and military of South Vietnam have fully unleashed the power of people's war, continuously foiling the multiple large-scale "sweeping operations" launched by American aggressors, and bringing the victories won since last November's dry season to new heights. This has severely struck the U.S. imperialists' plot, in collusion with the Soviet modern revisionists, to "force peace through war."

To escape the quagmire in South Vietnam and attempt to use the expansion of the war to force the South Vietnamese people to surrender and create a "negotiation" situation, the U.S. imperialists have, since the beginning of this year, while continuously increasing their troops, launched a series of "sweeping operations" in West Ninh Province, the central region, the outskirts of Saigon, and the Mekong Delta liberation areas. They aim to annihilate the people's armed forces and occupy the liberation areas. However, these "sweeping operations" by the American aggressors have, as usual, ended in shameful failure in the face of the heroic people and the brave and tenacious liberation armed forces of South Vietnam.

West Ninh Province, which has long been a thorn in the side of the American aggressors as a shield to the west of Saigon, has been the target of multiple "sweeping operations" by the American bandits since the end of last year. However, they were beaten back with heavy losses, suffering approximately four thousand casualties in November and December. After the failure of the "sweeping operation" launched by the U.S.-puppet forces in West Ninh Province in January, the American bandits launched another large-scale "sweeping operation" in February, but this time they suffered an even more humiliating defeat. In the first half of February alone, more than a thousand American troops were annihilated by the liberation armed forces; by the end of February, fourteen entire companies of American invaders had been wiped out in West Ninh Province.

In the strategically important central region provinces of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Kon Tum, and Gia Lai, the liberation armed forces have also achieved brilliant results in the anti-"sweeping operation" battles. In January, the people and military of Quang Ngai Province successfully foiled eight "sweeping operations" launched by U.S.-puppet forces and South Korean mercenary troops against the counties of Phu My, Son Ha, Thuy Y, and Duc Thanh, annihilating more than two thousand enemy troops, including approximately seven hundred and fifty American invaders and nearly two hundred and fifty South Korean mercenaries. From February 17th to 19th, the liberation armed forces in this province again fought in Son Ha and Phu My, killing and wounding nearly a thousand enemy troops and completely annihilating or severely maiming five puppet army battalions. The liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province have fought many brilliant battles, annihilating nearly two thousand five hundred enemy troops in January, the vast majority of whom were American invaders. In the anti-"sweeping operation" battles, the liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh Province alone annihilated five hundred and fifty American invaders from January 27th to February 7th and shot down or damaged sixty-seven enemy helicopters.

The large-scale "sweeping operations" launched by the American aggressors with great effort in the outskirts of Saigon have also ended in shameful failure. In particular, in the western outskirts of Saigon in Tu Duong Province, the American bandits have been beaten back in disarray. From January 2nd to 29th, thirty thousand U.S.-puppet forces launched a large-scale "sweeping operation" against the liberation areas in Tu Duong Province, deploying more than four hundred tanks, eighty warships, a large number of aircraft, and using artillery for cover. They arrogantly boasted of "erasing Bien Hoa County from the map." However, the well-prepared people and military of Tu Duong Province fought back, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, annihilating more than three thousand one hundred enemy troops, almost all of whom were American troops. American invaders in the New An-Di An region, Gia Dinh, and Bien Hoa provinces near Saigon also suffered heavy losses from continuous attacks in January and February.

For a long time, the American aggressors have coveted the Mekong Delta region, known as the "granary of South Vietnam," to relieve the threat to Saigon and "cut off" the food supply of the liberation armed forces. To prepare for the "entry" of a large number of American troops into the delta region, the U.S.-puppet forces have intensified their "sweeping operations" in this region since the beginning of this year. However, in the delta's Kien Giang Province alone, the liberation armed forces annihilated one thousand four hundred U.S.-puppet troops in anti-"sweeping operation" battles from January 4th to 16th. On February 18th, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy stronghold in Kien Giang City, annihilating one main puppet battalion and three companies. In the Mekong Delta's My Tho and Kien Hoa provinces, the liberation armed forces alone annihilated two puppet battalions in one day on January 19th.

While successfully conducting anti-"sweeping operations," the liberation armed forces have also continuously launched fierce attacks on the bases of the American aggressors, striking the enemy in disarray, making them sleepless and anxious. On January 6th, the liberation armed forces in Gia Lai Province launched a surprise attack on the U.S. Air Force base in Pleiku, achieving a brilliant victory, annihilating two hundred and eighty American troops and destroying sixty-two helicopters. On the early morning of February 4th, the liberation armed forces in Bien Hoa Province launched a fierce attack on the Long Binh U.S. logistics base, twenty kilometers northeast of Saigon, turning the entire base into a sea of fire, destroying forty ammunition depots, and annihilating one hundred and seven American invaders. On the morning of February 13th, the liberation armed forces also, for the first time, set up mortars in Saigon City to shell the invading U.S. military headquarters. The shells exploded near the headquarters, nearly killing the invading U.S. commander, Westmoreland, who was in the office. In February, eight U.S. military airfields in various regions of South Vietnam were attacked by the liberation armed forces, causing heavy losses to the American invaders and their lackeys.

The situation in South Vietnam this year is excellent. The people and military of South Vietnam are growing stronger in battle, and the initiative on the battlefield is firmly in the hands of the people and military of South Vietnam. Currently, the American aggressors are frantically increasing their troops in South Vietnam and crazily expanding the war, but this does not indicate their strength; on the contrary, this is a manifestation of their weakness. Chairman Mao said: "U.S. imperialism is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. We must have a clear mind, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not fearing the threats of imperialism." In direct confrontation with U.S. imperialism, the heroic people and military of South Vietnam annihilated nearly eleven thousand American invaders in 1966. This year, they have achieved new victories in annihilating a large number of American troops. It can be fully believed that the people and military of South Vietnam will, in the future, overcome numerous difficulties, inflict even heavier blows on the American bandits, and carry out the struggle for national liberation and against U.S. aggression to complete victory!

    发挥人民战争强大威力　狠狠打击美帝“以战迫和”阴谋
    南越军民越战越强　南越战场形势大好
    各地军民今年来连打胜仗一再粉碎美军“扫荡”，歼敌一万多
    新华社十二日讯  本社记者报道：今年年初以来，越南南方各战场上捷报频传，英勇善战的越南南方军民，发挥人民战争的强大威力，接连地粉碎了美国侵略强盗发动的多次大规模“扫荡”，把从去年十一月旱季开始赢得的胜利引到了新的高峰，狠狠地打击了美帝国主义勾结苏联现代修正主义集团策划“以战迫和”的大阴谋。
    美帝国主义为了摆脱在南越深陷泥潭的困境，并妄图以扩大战争来迫使南越人民屈服，压出一个“和谈”局面来，从今年年初开始，在不断增兵的同时，向西宁省、中部地区、西贡周围和湄公河三角洲等解放区发动了一系列“扫荡”，企图消灭人民武装力量和侵占解放区。但是，美国侵略者的这些“扫荡”，象往常一样，在英雄的越南南方人民和英勇顽强的解放武装力量面前，都以可耻的失败而告终。
    作为西贡西北屏障的西宁省解放区，长期以来成了美国侵略者的眼中钉。还在去年年末，美国强盗就向这里发动了多次“扫荡”，但被当地军民打得头破血流，在十一、十二两个月中损兵折将约达四千人。今年一月间美伪军向西宁省发动的“扫荡”遭到失败后，二月间美国强盗又发动了大规模“扫荡”，但这一次失败得更惨。单在二月上半月美军就被解放武装力量消灭一千多名；到二月底，美国侵略军在西宁省被歼达十四个整连之多。
    在具有战略意义的中部地区的广南、广义、平定、昆嵩、嘉莱等省，解放武装力量在反“扫荡”的战斗中，也取得了辉煌战果。广义省军民在一月份的战斗中，胜利地粉碎了美伪军和南朝鲜帮凶军对平山、山晶、思义、德善等县发动的八次“扫荡”，共消灭敌人两千多名，其中包括美国侵略军约七百五十名和南朝鲜帮凶军近二百五十名。这个省的解放武装力量在二月十七日到十九日期间，又在山晶、平山等地打死打伤敌人近千名，全歼和严重杀伤伪军五个营。广南省解放武装力量打了许多漂亮仗，在一月份共消灭敌人近两千五百名，其中绝大部分是美国侵略军。平定省解放武装力量在反“扫荡”战斗中，单从一月二十七日到二月七日就消灭美国侵略军五百五十人，并且击落击伤敌人直升飞机六十七架。
    美国侵略者费尽九牛二虎之力在西贡周围地区发动的大规模“扫荡”，也都遭到了可耻的失败。特别是在西贡西北的土龙木省，美国强盗更是被打得焦头烂额。从一月二日到二十九日，三万名美伪军向土龙木省解放区发动了大规模“扫荡”，敌人出动四百多辆坦克、八十艘战船、大批飞机，并用大炮进行掩护，狂妄地叫嚷“把边蓄县从地图上抹去”。但是严阵以待的土龙木省军民，打得敌人死伤累累，共歼敌三千一百多人，其中几乎全部是美军。美国侵略军在西贡附近的新安—堤岸地区、嘉定、边和等省一、二月份也不断受到袭击，死伤惨重。
    长期以来，美国侵略者就渴望夺取号称南越谷仓的湄公河三角洲地区，以解除对西贡的威胁，并“断绝”解放武装力量的粮食来源。为了给大批美军“进驻”三角洲地区作准备，今年年初以来，美伪军加紧了对这个地区的“扫荡”。但是，单在三角洲的槟椥省，解放武装力量从一月四日到十六日在反“扫荡”战斗中，就打死打伤美伪军一千四百人。二月十八日，解放武装力量又向槟椥市敌军据点发起猛攻，一举消灭伪军一个主力营和三个排。在湄公河三角洲的美萩省和茶荣省，解放武装力量仅在一月十九日一天，就吃掉了两个营的伪军。
    在胜利进行反“扫荡”的同时，解放武装力量还不断猛烈袭击美国侵略强盗的基地，打得敌人狼狈不堪，寝食不安，惶惶不可终日。一月六日，嘉莱省解放武装力量奇袭波来古美国空军基地，取得辉煌胜利，一举消灭美军二百八十人，炸毁直升飞机六十二架。边和省解放武装力量二月四日凌晨猛烈袭击西贡东北二十公里的龙平美军后勤基地，使整个基地变成一片火海，炸毁弹药库四十座，消灭美国侵略军一百零七名。解放武装力量二月十三日上午还第一次在西贡市内架设迫击炮，轰击侵越美军司令部。炮弹在司令部附近爆炸，正在办公室内的侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰险些丧命。在二月份，南越各地先后有八个美军机场遭到了解放武装力量的袭击，美国侵略军及其走狗损失严重。
    今年年初以来的战局表明，越南南方的形势大好。南越军民越战越强，战场的主动权牢牢操在越南南方军民手中。当前美国侵略者正在大肆增兵南越，疯狂扩大战争，但这丝毫不表明它的强大，恰恰相反，这正是它虚弱的表现。毛主席说：“美国帝国主义是外强中干的。我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”在同美帝国主义直接较量中，英雄的越南南方军民在一九六六年已经消灭了近十一万名美国侵略军，今年以来又取得了歼灭大量美军的新胜利。完全可以相信，越南南方军民今后必将克服重重困难，给美国强盗以更加沉重的打击，把抗美救国斗争进行到彻底胜利！（附图片）
