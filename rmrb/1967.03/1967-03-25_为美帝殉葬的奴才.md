The American imperialists have just concluded their Guam conference to plot further escalation of the war in Vietnam, and the Thai reactionary government has decided to allow U.S. B-52 strategic bombers to be stationed in Thailand to launch bombing raids on Vietnam from Thai territory. This once again proves that the Thanom group is a loyal lackey and servant of American imperialism, a traitor who sells out the interests of the Thai people.

The Thai reactionary government has long sold out Thailand to American imperialism, turning it into a military base for U.S. aggression against Indochina and Southeast Asia. It has also eagerly served as a henchman in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam. The Thanom group's policies of bringing misfortune to the country and its people have already stirred up strong resistance from the Thai people. Now, by tying itself even more tightly to the American imperialist war chariot and further serving the U.S. in its escalation of the war in Vietnam, the Thanom sellout clique is only hastening its own doom. Its retrograde and reactionary actions will inevitably fan the flames of the people's armed struggle that have already sprung up in various parts of Thailand, thus hastening its own downfall.

Chairman Mao has pointed out, "Those who are determined to be led by the nose by American imperialism will in the end only become sacrificial offerings for American imperialism." This is the inevitable fate of the Thai reactionary government.

    为美帝殉葬的奴才
    美帝国主义策划进一步扩大侵越战争的关岛会议刚刚结束，泰国反动政府就决定让美国的B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国，从泰国出发去轰炸越南。这就再次证明了他侬集团是美帝国主义的忠顺走卒和奴才，是出卖泰国人民利益的卖国贼。
    泰国反动政府早就把泰国出卖给美帝国主义，作为美国侵略印度支那和东南亚的军事基地，并且十分积极地充当美国侵略越南的帮凶。他侬集团祸国殃民的政策，已经激起了泰国人民的强烈反抗。现在，它把自己更紧地缚在美帝国主义的战车上，进一步为美帝国主义扩大侵越战争效劳。他侬卖国集团的倒行逆施，必然要使已经在泰国各处点燃起来的人民武装斗争的烈火更加炽烈地燃烧起来，从而加速自己末日的到来。
    毛主席指出，“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”这就是泰国反动政府的必然下场。
