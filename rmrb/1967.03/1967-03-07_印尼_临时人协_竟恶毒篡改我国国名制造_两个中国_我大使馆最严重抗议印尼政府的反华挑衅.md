	The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on March 6 sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing strong indignation over the malicious insults and serious provocations against the People's Republic of China by the Indonesian "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly," and the arrogant alteration of the name of the great People's Republic of China. The embassy also lodged the strongest protest with the Indonesian government.

	The note said: "Recently, the Indonesian 'Provisional People's Consultative Assembly' has continuously and maliciously insulted and seriously provoked the People's Republic of China. On February 28, 1967, the leadership of the Indonesian 'Provisional People's Consultative Assembly' invited the Chinese Ambassador to attend the opening and closing ceremonies of its 'special meeting.' The invitation letter maliciously changed the name of the People's Republic of China to 'Republic of China.' The embassy immediately took a firm stand, refusing to accept the invitation, and through the messenger lodged a serious protest. The leadership then sent another invitation on March 3, this time inviting the chargé d'affaires of the embassy, again changing the name of the People's Republic of China to 'Republic of China.' The embassy has once again strongly condemned this and returned the invitation letter. The embassy expresses strong indignation over the leadership of the 'Provisional People's Consultative Assembly' deliberately insulting the Chinese people and repeatedly provoking them, and lodges the strongest protest with the Indonesian government."

	The note pointed out: "It is well known that the so-called 'Republic of China' is nothing more than a name discarded by the Chinese people and nurtured by American imperialism for a small group of KMT bandits. Now, the leadership of your so-called 'highest state power organ' is brazenly using this dirty name to defame the great People's Republic of China. This is not accidental. Since last May, you have been colluding with the KMT, engaging in shameful activities. Your ambassadors to Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan have been frequently colluding with the KMT 'ambassadors,' establishing contacts. Your foreign minister admitted last December that your ambassador to Japan had visited Taiwan to carry out some secret mission. Your radio stations refer to the KMT as the 'Taiwan government' and to the enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek, as the 'Taiwan state leader.' This fully exposes your willingness to be a lackey of American imperialism, slavishly serving your master to create 'two Chinas.'"

	The note further pointed out: "'China' is a term used by imperialists and colonialists during their rule over Indonesia to insult the Chinese people. Despite our repeated protests, you shamelessly use this term of the imperialists and colonialists to maliciously alter the name of the great People's Republic of China. Let me tell you: the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong will not tolerate insults. Your despicable actions will not only be opposed by the Indonesian people but will also be condemned by the people of the world."

	The note said: "In recent times, the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, while madly engaging in anti-China and expelling-China activities, have been loudly calling for the formation of some 'Southeast Asian Collective Defense Organization' to deal with the so-called 'threat from China,' 'to contain the aggression of Chinese imperialism,' and so on. Now, the leadership of the 'Provisional People's Consultative Assembly' headed by Nasution, on the eve of its 'special meeting,' has insulted and provoked China in an intolerable manner. This is not an isolated incident. In order to further sell out to American imperialism and receive rewards, you have been frantically inciting anti-China and expelling-China hysteria, using all kinds of despicable and shameless tricks to disrupt bilateral relations. Now, you arrogantly alter the name of the great People's Republic of China, which is utterly absurd and extremely stupid. As the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao said: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, till their doom—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people's cause; they are doomed to fail. This is a law of Marxism.' We warn the Indonesian government: all your anti-China plots are doomed to fail. You will 'lift a rock only to drop it on your own feet' and ultimately suffer the consequences."

	The Chinese Embassy in the note solemnly demands that the Indonesian government immediately apologize publicly for this incident and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. Otherwise, the Indonesian government will be fully responsible for all consequences arising from this.

    印尼“临时人协”竟恶毒篡改我国国名制造“两个中国”
    我大使馆最严重抗议印尼政府的反华挑衅
    新华社六日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆六日照会印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚“临时人民协商会议”对中华人民共和国连续进行恶毒的侮辱和严重的挑衅，狂妄地篡改伟大的中华人民共和国国名的卑劣行径，表示极大的愤慨，并且向印度尼西亚政府提出最严重的抗议。
    照会说：“最近，印度尼西亚‘临时人民协商会议’对中华人民共和国连续不断地进行了恶毒的侮辱和十分严重的挑衅。一九六七年二月二十八日，印度尼西亚‘临时人民协商会议’领导层，在邀请中国大使出席其‘特别会议’开幕式和闭幕式的请柬上，竟别有用心地把中华人民共和国写成‘中华民国’。大使馆当即严正表态，拒绝接受其请柬，并通过来人提出了严重抗议。而该领导层复于三月三日送来改为邀请大使馆临时代办的同样请柬上，又把中华人民共和国写成‘支那人民共和国’。大使馆已再次予以痛斥后将其请柬退回。对于‘临时人民协商会议’领导层这种蓄意侮辱中国人民和一再恶毒挑衅的行径，大使馆表示极大的愤慨，并向印度尼西亚政府提出最严重的抗议。”照会指出：“众所周知，所谓‘中华民国’，不过是早就为中国人民所唾弃、为美帝国主义所豢养的一小撮蒋介石匪帮的称号。现在你们的所谓‘最高国家权力机构’的领导层，竟公然使用这一肮脏的称号，来污辱伟大的中华人民共和国。这决不是偶然的。去年五月以来，你们就同蒋帮勾勾搭搭，进行见不得人的活动。你们驻泰国、菲律宾和日本的大使，不断同蒋帮‘大使’加紧勾结，建立联系。你们的外交部长去年十二月也承认，你们驻日本的大使曾访问台湾，执行某种不可告人的使命。你们的广播电台把蒋帮称为‘台湾政府’，把中国人民的公敌蒋介石称为‘台湾国家元首’。这就彻底暴露了你们甘当美帝国主义走卒，奴颜婢膝地为你们的主子制造‘两个中国’的阴谋效劳的丑恶嘴脸。”
    照会接着指出：“‘支那’一词，是帝国主义者和殖民主义者统治印度尼西亚时期用以侮辱中国人民的名称。你们不顾我们的多次抗议，竟不惜使用帝国主义者和殖民主义者的这种惯技，肆意篡改伟大的中华人民共和国的国名。老实告诉你们：用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，是不容侮辱的。你们这种卑劣的行径，不仅要遭到印度尼西亚人民的反对，而且也将受到世界人民的谴责。”
    照会说：“最近时期以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力，在疯狂进行反华排华的同时，又大肆叫嚷要拼凑什么‘东南亚共同防御组织’来对付所谓‘来自中国的威胁’，‘遏制中国帝国主义的侵略’等等。现在以纳苏蒂安为首的‘临时人民协商会议’领导层，又在其‘特别会议’开幕前夕，对中国进行不能容忍的污辱和挑衅，这决不是孤立的事件。你们为了进一步卖身投靠美帝国主义，领取犒赏，大肆煽动反华排华的歇斯底里，使尽了各种卑鄙无耻的花招，以破坏两国关系。现在竟狂妄地篡改伟大的中华人民共和国的国名，这真是荒谬之极，愚蠢透顶。正如中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席所说的：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。’我们正告印度尼西亚政府：你们的一切反华阴谋是注定要破产的。你们必将‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，终究要自食其恶果。”
    中国大使馆在照会中严正要求印度尼西亚政府就此事件立即公开道歉，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。否则由此而产生的一切后果，都由印度尼西亚政府完全负责。
