The joyous news of the successful convening of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress (Workers' Congress) has greatly inspired the broad revolutionary workers in all factories, mines, and enterprises across the city. They enthusiastically hail the great unity and alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the capital's factories, mines, and enterprises under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They declare that they will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call to the revolutionary workers and cadres in factories and mines across the country, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They will fully unleash the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity stirred up during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, redouble their efforts, strive to be in the forefront, and launch a new high tide of seizing revolution and promoting production.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Postage Stamp Factory, who have already completed their first-quarter production tasks eight days ahead of schedule, said that the successful convening of the Workers' Congress is the greatest trust and concern shown by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the working class. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and march forward courageously. We must resolutely overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois line, resolutely repel the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration tide, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing revolution and promoting production" to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

During the preparatory period of the Workers' Congress, the red rebels and revolutionary workers of the No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory decided to present excellent results to Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Workers' Congress. By March 23rd, the Second Processing Workshop and the Freight Car Workshop had completed their March production tasks seven days ahead of schedule. The successful convening of the Workers' Congress has further inspired the enthusiasm of the red rebels and revolutionary workers, who are determined to achieve even greater results to bring glory to Chairman Mao and to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In their spare time, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Jianhua Foundry held a meeting to convey the spirit of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress and seriously studied and discussed the important instructions given by Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Boda at the meeting. The red rebels in this factory have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize revolution and promote production," united all revolutionary workers in the factory, and fought resolutely against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They have also made production rise steadily and completed the state plan in excess every month. Under the inspiration of the joyous news of the successful convening of the Workers' Congress, the revolutionary workers throughout the factory have expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, creating new achievements in production.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory also expressed that they must strive to study Chairman Mao's works, focus on the "use" aspect, seriously reform their thoughts, and sweep away the "self" from their minds. They will be models for promoting the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and implement the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy. They will establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ with proletarian authority to lead revolutionary and production work, and successfully complete the great tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company, upon hearing their representatives convey the important instructions given by Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Boda at the Workers' Congress, were all filled with joy and excitement. Some were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes. Everyone raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They said, "The heavens are vast, the earth is vast, but nothing is greater than the Party's kindness. Father and mother are dear, but nothing is dearer than Chairman Mao. We must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road at the same time, and resolutely seize power from the 'self' in our minds, forever being proletarian revolutionary warriors.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Branch of the China Light Industry Import and Export Corporation said, "We must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: 'We must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the crazed revenge plots of the imperialists and their running dogs.' The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society are not reconciled to their failures. They have not given up and are always waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. We, the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, never halting midway."

The standing committee established during the closing of the Workers' Congress has already begun its work. The committee members from various factories, mines, and enterprises unanimously agreed that the successful convening of the Workers' Congress has greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary factions and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie! They declared that they must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, unite the broad revolutionary workers and cadres in all factories, mines, and enterprises across the city, and better achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions by system, department, and unit. On the industrial, transportation, urban construction, and financial and commercial fronts, they will complete the glorious tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform. At the same time, they must unite more closely with the poor and lower-middle peasants, with all laboring people, and with all revolutionary intellectuals, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and strive forward courageously to build a red Beijing.
