Shanghai Sixth Machine Tool Factory's proletarian revolutionary faction took power after seizing control from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. They united the masses, correctly dealt with cadres, and completed the first quarter's state production plan ahead of schedule on March 22.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the counter-revolutionary economic wind was driven back, and conservative organizations like the "Red Guards" were disbanded. However, some workers who had been influenced by the economic wind, as well as those who had once joined conservative organizations, still had ideological burdens and low production enthusiasm due to their lack of awareness. The revolutionary faction workers felt that these comrades' ideological burdens needed to be addressed for the benefit of both the revolution and production. They held several meetings to deeply expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who had spread the economic wind, helping everyone see their evil intentions of shifting the direction of the struggle, inciting workers to leave their production posts, and sabotaging production and the Cultural Revolution. For the masses who had been deceived into joining conservative organizations, they held multiple meetings and heart-to-heart talks, explaining policies in detail, and enthusiastically helping them raise their consciousness and stand on the side of Mao Zedong's revolutionary line. During these activities, the revolutionary faction workers studied Mao Zedong's works and relevant editorials with them, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Through these efforts, the deceived workers raised their consciousness, voluntarily started to eliminate the "private" thoughts in their minds, removed their concerns, and their production enthusiasm soared. The lathe group, which had the task of processing five tool grinders, originally scheduled for completion in March, finished everything ahead of schedule in February. The lathe group, which had previously participated in the "Red Guards," exposed the activities of some bad elements after raising their consciousness and actively improved production with the rest of the group. Previously, this group struggled to bore two speed boxes a day, but now they can bore five or six.

Many cadres in the factory had made mistakes to varying degrees in the struggle between the two lines. After the revolutionary faction took power, they studied Mao Zedong's cadre policy and the principle of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," and propagated this to the masses, discussing it with them, and conducting class analyses of the cadres, treating them differently. They decided to assist nine middle-level and above cadres who had made fewer mistakes and were willing to correct them in managing production, letting them work while checking their mistakes. The revolutionary faction workers also organized cadres to study Mao Zedong's works and relevant editorials, helping them carry out self-revolution to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, change their style of work, and strengthen their relationship with the masses; on the other hand, they required the masses to actively support the cadres, giving them the authority to take responsibility. In this way, the cadres' enthusiasm was aroused. A deputy factory director, who used to stay in the office looking at reports and listening to briefings, now often goes to the workshop, participates in labor, discusses with the masses, and solves several important production problems.

Now, the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in this factory, inspired by the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country," have even higher revolutionary enthusiasm. They are writing pledge letters, resolutely declaring that under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, they will unite more closely, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong's works, launch a new production high tide, make the revolution and production even better, and complete the second quarter and the entire year's plan even more excellently.

    革命派掌权后团结广大群众正确对待干部
    上海第六机床厂提前完成第一季度计划
    全厂革命职工决心乘胜前进把革命和生产搞得好上加好
    新华社上海二十八日电　上海第六机床厂无产阶级革命派掌权后，团结群众，正确对待干部，使全厂第一季度的国家生产计划，提前在三月二十二日超额完成。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，反革命经济主义妖风被打退了，“赤卫队”等保守派组织瓦解了。但是，有些受了经济主义妖风影响的职工，以及一度参加保守派组织的职工，由于认识还没有提高，思想上有包袱，生产情绪不高。厂里的革命派职工感到这些同志的思想包袱不放下来，既不利于革命，也不利于生产。他们连续召开几次大会，对刮经济主义妖风的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行进行深入的揭发和批判，让大家看清他们刮这股妖风的罪恶目的，是要转移斗争的大方向，唆使工人离开生产岗位，破坏生产，破坏文化大革命。对于受蒙蔽而参加保守派组织的群众，多次同他们开会和谈心，详细交代政策，热情地帮助他们提高觉悟，站到毛主席的革命路线一边。在进行这些工作的时候，革命派职工同他们一起学习毛主席著作和有关社论，让他们用毛泽东思想武装头脑。经过这一些工作，受蒙蔽的职工觉悟了，自觉地向头脑里的“私”字开刀，消除了顾虑，生产热情跟着高涨起来。钳床一组有加工五台工具磨床的任务，原来安排在三月份完成，结果在二月份就全部提前完成。车床一组参加过“赤卫队”的工人觉悟后，起来揭发一些坏人的幕前幕后活动，并同全组工人一起积极搞好生产。过去这个组一天镗两只变速箱还吃紧，现在一天可以镗五、六只。
    厂里不少干部在两条路线斗争中，不同程度地犯过一些错误。革命派职工掌权以后学习了毛主席的干部政策和“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，就向群众宣传，同群众讨论，对干部进行阶级分析，区别对待。他们决定先协助九个错误较少又愿意改正的中层以上干部抓好生产，让他们一边工作，一边检查错误。革命派职工还组织干部学习毛主席著作和有关社论，帮助他们进行破私立公的自我革命，改变作风，密切和群众的关系；另一方面，要求群众积极支持干部，使干部有职有权，敢于负责。这样，干部的积极性调动起来了。有一位副厂长过去习惯于坐在办公室看报表，听汇报；现在经常下车间，参加劳动，和群众商量，解决了好几个生产上的重要问题。
    现在，这个厂的革命职工和革命干部在《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》的鼓舞下，革命热情更加高涨。他们纷纷写决心书，坚决表示要在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，更加紧密地团结起来，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，掀起生产新高潮，把革命和生产搞得好上加好，把第二季度和全年的计划完成得更加出色。
