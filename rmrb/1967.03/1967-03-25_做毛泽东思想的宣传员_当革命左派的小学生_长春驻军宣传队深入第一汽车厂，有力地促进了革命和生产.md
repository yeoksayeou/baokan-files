The People's Liberation Army garrison in Changchun has responded to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee by organizing a propaganda team composed of soldiers and officers to enter the First Automobile Works in Changchun. They have vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution and promote production" and actively supported the production work of the automobile factory. Under the inspiration of the great Mao Zedong Thought, all the revolutionary workers in the factory are full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm, and both revolution and production are in full swing. By March 20th, the daily production of automobiles had doubled compared to the previous ten days.

The Party Committee of the Changchun garrison of the People's Liberation Army has seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest directives and deeply felt that the great leader Mao Chairman has entrusted the important task of assisting local industries in production to the People's Liberation Army, which is the greatest trust. They must resolutely carry out this task. Therefore, they immediately organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. On the day this propaganda team composed of soldiers and officers entered the First Automobile Works in Changchun, they turned the welcoming meeting into a meeting to convey Chairman Mao's great directives and to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary workers were deeply moved upon hearing Chairman Mao's voice and shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Many representatives of revolutionary organizations expressed at the meeting their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call with practical actions and to achieve a double victory in revolution and production.

After entering the factory, this Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team dispersed to various sub-factories, workshops, and production teams, eating, studying, and working together with the workers. They further carried out in-depth and detailed political and ideological work. In various sub-factories and workshops, they used radio stations, blackboards, big-character posters, and other forms to seize every possible opportunity to propagate to the workers. They adopted the attitude of being willing to be small students to learn from the revolutionary leftists and also organized advanced workers to hold discussions, learning from their advanced thoughts and deeds in grasping revolution and promoting production, and then propagated them within the factory.

In the foundry, which is crucial to the entire factory's production, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team selected a group of activists who study Chairman Mao's works to train Mao Zedong Thought propagandists for this sub-factory. The revolutionary workers in the off-road, stamping, and chassis sub-factories, after deeply studying Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution and promote production," saw their production rise steadily. The off-road sub-factory has completed or exceeded the production plan every day since mid-March. Some workers in the forging die workshop completed the entire month's die processing task in just a few days.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army also addressed some ideological issues among the revolutionary workers, guiding them to use Mao Zedong Thought as a criterion. Under the premise of unity in the revolutionary direction, they sought common ground while reserving differences, promoting the revolutionary great alliance within the factory by units and departments. This simplified many revolutionary organizational structures and reduced the number of non-production personnel. The foundry and engine sub-factories, which have already achieved revolutionary great alliances by units and departments, have seen their production increase by more than 50% in the past ten days compared to the previous ten days.

This Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team also organized special personnel to guide the factory's leading cadres in studying Chairman Mao's latest directives and the editorials of the "Red Flag" magazine, and conducted detailed ideological work. Some leading cadres who had made mistakes expressed their determination to draw a clear line with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, to draw a clear line with the capitalist reactionary line, to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to humbly accept the supervision of the masses, and to make amends with practical actions of grasping revolution and promoting production.

Currently, the factory has established, according to the workers' requirements, various levels of "three-in-one" production command departments composed of representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, local garrison representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres, to grasp revolution and promote production. The publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country" has further inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative of all revolutionary workers in the factory. They expressed their determination to listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's directives, and become the most outstanding models of grasping revolution and promoting production. They will turn the First Automobile Works in Changchun into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought and produce more and better automobiles to support the socialist construction of the motherland and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

    做毛泽东思想的宣传员
    当革命左派的小学生
    长春驻军宣传队深入第一汽车厂，有力地促进了革命和生产
    新华社长春二十三日电　人民解放军长春驻军某部响应毛主席、党中央的伟大号召，由指战员组成一支毛泽东思想宣传队，深入长春第一汽车制造厂，大力宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，积极支持汽车厂的生产工作。全厂广大革命职工在伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞下，斗志昂扬，干劲倍增，革命和生产呈现一派热气腾腾的景象。到本月二十日，汽车日产量就比上旬的日产量猛增了一倍。
    人民解放军长春驻军某部党委认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，深深地感到，伟大领袖毛主席把协助地方支持工业生产的重大任务交给解放军，是对解放军的最大信任，一定要坚决执行。于是马上着手组织毛泽东思想宣传队。一支由指战员组成的宣传队在进入长春第一汽车制造厂的当天，就把欢迎大会变成了传达毛主席的伟大指示和宣传毛泽东思想的大会。广大革命职工听到毛主席的声音，心情万分激动，同声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”许多革命组织的代表在会上表示，决心以实际行动响应毛主席的伟大号召，夺取革命、生产双丰收。
    这支毛泽东思想宣传队进厂后就分散到各分厂、车间以及生产班组，和工人们吃在一起，学习在一起，劳动在一起，进一步开展深入细致的政治思想工作。他们在各个分厂、车间，利用广播站、黑板报、大字报等多种形式，抓紧一切可以利用的机会，向职工们进行宣传。他们以甘当小学生的态度，向革命左派学习，并且召集先进工人座谈，学习他们抓革命、促生产的先进思想和事迹，然后在厂内宣传。
    在全厂生产最关键的铸造分厂，毛泽东思想宣传队还选拔出一批学习毛主席著作积极分子，为这个分厂培训毛泽东思想宣传员。越野、冲压、底盘等分厂革命职工，深入学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示以后，生产节节上升。越野分厂从三月中旬以来，天天完成或超额完成生产计划。锻模车间有些工人，只用十几天时间就完成了全月的模具加工任务。
    解放军同志还针对革命职工中存在的一些思想认识问题，启发大家以毛泽东思想为指针，在革命大方向一致的前提下，求大同，存小异，促进了全厂按单位、按部门的革命大联合，从而精简了许多革命组织机构，压缩了脱产人员。已经实现按单位、按部门革命大联合的铸造、发动机两个分厂，近十天来，生产比上旬猛增百分之五十以上。
    这支毛泽东思想宣传队还派专人组织厂里领导干部学习毛主席的最新指示和《红旗》杂志社论，并且进行了细致的思想工作。一些犯过错误的领导干部表示，坚决同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，坚决同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来，虚心接受群众监督，用抓革命、促生产的实际行动，将功补过。
    目前，这个厂根据职工要求，组成了由革命群众组织的负责人、人民解放军当地驻军的代表、革命领导干部参加的各级“三结合”生产指挥部，抓革命，促生产。《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》的发表，更加激发了全厂广大革命职工的革命干劲和生产积极性。他们表示，一定要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做抓革命、促生产的最出色的模范，把长春第一汽车制造厂办成毛泽东思想大学校，生产出更多更好的汽车，支援祖国社会主义建设，支援世界人民的革命斗争。
