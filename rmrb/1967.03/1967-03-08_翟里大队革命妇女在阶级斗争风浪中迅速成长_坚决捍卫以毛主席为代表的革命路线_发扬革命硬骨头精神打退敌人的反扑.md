The revolutionary women of Zhai Li Brigade, Songzhuang People's Commune, Tongxian County, Beijing, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. At this crucial moment of class struggle, they have stood up firmly to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

In the first half of 1966, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the old Beijing Municipal Committee, together with a small clique of capitalists in power in Zhai Li Brigade and some landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, colluded with each other, joining forces to launch a fierce counterattack against the poor and lower-middle peasants. They attempted to sabotage the great achievements of the Four Clean-ups movement. At that time, the revolutionary women of Zhai Li Brigade stood firmly on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Together with revolutionary cadres, they united the broad masses of laboring people and repulsed the "reversal of verdicts" wind stirred up by the class enemies.

Class enemies never give up easily. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao began to rise in Zhai Li Brigade, the small clique of capitalists in power who had been overthrown during the Four Clean-ups and some landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements regrouped. They manipulated the brigade's Cultural Revolution Committee, organized the reactionary "Red Flag Combat Team," and put forward the counter-revolutionary economic slogan of "redividing land within the brigade." They incited the masses to fight against each other, shifting the direction of the struggle. At this critical moment, the revolutionary women firmly followed Chairman Mao's words: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" They opened their eyes wide and saw through the class enemies' tricks. The brigade's Cultural Revolution Committee did not guide the members to study Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points." Instead, they spent all day on the trick of "redividing land." They also maliciously "studied" the big-character posters written by revolutionary cadres to carry out political frame-ups. After uncovering this counter-revolutionary plot, Wang Baolan, a woman from the Sixth Team, immediately withdrew from the team's Cultural Revolution Committee and resumed revolutionary connections. She joined the "Red Rebel Corps," and together with other revolutionary women, on one hand, fought firmly against the Cultural Revolution Committee; on the other hand, they patiently persuaded and educated the deceived masses, helping them return to Chairman Mao's correct line, and directing the struggle against the small clique of capitalists in power within the Party and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements.

The storm of the January Revolution in Shanghai swept across the entire country, and the proletariat and the bourgeoisie engaged in a sharp and intense struggle. The small clique of capitalists in power who had been overthrown during the Four Clean-ups in Zhai Li Brigade and some landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements fought desperately, struggling to the death, and attempted to seize power from the revolutionary masses. They poisoned and beat the revolutionary cadres of the brigade, implementing white terror. On February 8, the class enemies struck at the strong revolutionary cadre Deng Wantiand. At this moment when Deng Wantiand's life was in danger, the revolutionary women of Zhai Li, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, united closely, displayed the proletarian spirit of hard bones, and engaged in a face-to-face fierce struggle with the class enemies. They protected the revolutionary cadres Deng Wantiand and others, repelling the class enemies' counterattack once again.

Now, it is the busy spring planting season. The women of Zhai Li Brigade actively respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, grasp revolution, promote production, and production enthusiasm has reached an unprecedented height. They are not afraid of the cold and not afraid of hard work, fighting on the front line of spring planting production.

    翟里大队革命妇女在阶级斗争风浪中迅速成长
    坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的革命路线
    发扬革命硬骨头精神打退敌人的反扑
    本报讯　北京通县宋庄人民公社翟里大队的革命妇女，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在阶级斗争的紧要关头，挺身而出，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    一九六六年上半年，旧北京市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子和翟里大队的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及地、富、反、坏分子，互相勾结，狼狈为奸，向贫下中农进行猖狂的反扑，妄图破坏四清运动伟大成果。那时候，翟里大队的革命妇女，就坚定地站在贫下中农立场上，跟革命干部一起，团结广大劳动群众，打退了阶级敌人掀起的“翻案风”。
    阶级敌人总是不甘心灭亡的。当毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命在翟里大队开始兴起时，这个大队在四清中被打倒的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一些地、富、反、坏分子，重新勾结起来，实行反革命的“小联合”。他们操纵大队文革委员会，组织反动的“红旗战斗队”，提出“要在大队范围内重新平分土地”的反革命经济主义口号，挑动群众斗群众，转移斗争的大方向。正在这个紧要时刻，革命的妇女坚决听毛主席的话：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”她们擦亮眼睛，看出了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。大队
  “文革”不引导社员学习毛主席著作和《十六条》，成天地搞什么“重新平分土地”的鬼花样；还别有用心地“研究”革命干部写的大字报，以便进行政治陷害。六队妇女王宝兰同志识破这个反革命阴谋之后，就立即退出小队“文革”，重新进行革命串连，加入了“红色造反团”，同其他革命妇女一起，一方面跟“文革”作坚决斗争；一方面对受蒙蔽的社员群众进行耐心的说服教育工作，帮助他们回到毛主席的正确路线上来，把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地、富、反、坏分子。
    上海“一月革命”的风暴席卷全中国，无产阶级和资产阶级进行了尖锐激烈的大搏斗。翟里大队在四清中被打倒的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地、富、反、坏分子，拚死反抗，垂死挣扎，向无产阶级革命派进行夺权。他们毒打大队革命干部，实行白色恐怖。二月八日，阶级敌人对坚强的革命干部邓万田同志下了毒手。正在邓万田同志有生命危险的时候，翟里的革命妇女，跟贫下中农紧紧地团结起来，发扬无产阶级硬骨头精神，跟阶级敌人作了一场面对面的激烈斗争，保护了革命干部邓万田等同志，打退了阶级敌人的又一次反扑。
    现在，正是春耕大忙季节。翟里大队妇女积极响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，生产积极性空前提高。她们不怕冷，不怕累，战斗在春耕生产第一线上。
