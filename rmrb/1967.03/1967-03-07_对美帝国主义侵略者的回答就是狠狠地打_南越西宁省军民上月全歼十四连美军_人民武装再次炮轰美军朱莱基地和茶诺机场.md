The response to the U.S. imperialist aggressors is to hit them hard. The military and civilians of West Ninh Province in South Vietnam completely annihilated fourteen companies of American troops last month. The people's armed forces once again bombarded the U.S. military base at Chu Lai and the Tan Son Nhut airfield.

	NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the military and civilians of West Ninh Province in South Vietnam continued to fight bravely in February, repeatedly defeating the "sweeping" operations of the American bandits and achieving the glorious victory of annihilating fourteen companies of American invading troops and one company of South Korean mercenaries.

	During this period, the liberation armed forces engaged in many fierce battles with the enemy. On February 28 alone, they annihilated two enemy companies.

	On this day, after annihilating two companies of American troops, the liberation armed forces pursued the enemy at night in the Chau Ong Hung area on the West Ninh to Oil Tin transportation line, launching a fierce attack on the U.S. 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, destroying 22 M-41 tanks and M-113 armored personnel carriers.

	That night, the West Ninh Province guerrilla forces also cleverly infiltrated the U.S. stronghold in the Bac Bau area, using grenades to kill 45 enemy soldiers.

	According to another report, in January of this year, the guerrilla forces in various parts of West Ninh Province closely cooperated with the main forces of the liberation army, frequently launching attacks in various places, and annihilating a large number of enemy troops. According to statistics, the guerrilla forces in the three counties of Dong Ban, Duong Minh Chu, and Chau Thanh alone conducted more than 70 battles, annihilating 382 enemy soldiers, including 157 American and Philippine mercenaries, destroying or damaging 19 enemy armored vehicles and 2 other military vehicles, and shooting down 4 enemy aircraft.

	SAIGON, March 6 (Xinhua) According to reports, the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam launched another artillery attack on the U.S. airbase at Chu Lai this morning. Preliminary reports from Western news agencies indicate that the shells hit the aircraft maintenance area and some U.S. barracks, destroying and damaging some aircraft, and killing and wounding some American aggressors who were sleeping soundly.

	This is the latest attack by the liberation armed forces following their eight consecutive victories in attacking U.S. airfields in February.

	HANOI, March 6 (Xinhua) According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the liberation armed forces of Kien Giang Province in South Vietnam launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military airfield at Tan Son Nhut on the night of February 6.

	According to preliminary reports, the shells of the liberation armed forces accurately hit the target, causing a warehouse on the airfield to catch fire and burn until the next afternoon. Many U.S. aircraft parked on the airfield were also destroyed and damaged.

	This is the fourth fierce attack by the liberation armed forces of Kien Giang Province on this U.S. military airfield since February 19, 1966.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the recent issue of the "People's Army" newspaper of Vietnam published a commentary, warmly praising the glorious achievements of the military and civilians of South Vietnam on the battlefield in February.

	The commentary said: In the past month, the liberation armed forces bravely intercepted the U.S. invading troops, making the American bandits' large-scale "sweeping" operations in the provinces of Kontum, Pleiku, Binh Dinh, West Ninh, and Bien Hoa suffer heavy defeats. The liberation armed forces' proactive attacks on the enemy have achieved great victories, foiling the American bandits' attempt to regain some initiative on the battlefield and making significant contributions to the annihilation of the enemy's troops.

	The commentary pointed out that it is obvious that in the past month, the liberation armed forces have continued to maintain and exert their strategic initiative on the battlefield.

    对美帝国主义侵略者的回答就是狠狠地打
    南越西宁省军民上月全歼十四连美军
    人民武装再次炮轰美军朱莱基地和茶诺机场
    新华社河内六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西宁省军民在二月份继续英勇奋战，接连挫败美国强盗的“扫荡”，取得了全歼美国侵略军十四个连和南朝鲜帮凶军一个连的辉煌战果。
    在这期间，解放武装力量同敌军进行了多次激烈的战斗，其中仅在二月二十八日一天，就全歼敌军两个连。
    这一天，解放武装力量在全歼美军两个连后，夜间又乘胜追击敌军，在西宁到油汀交通线上的帅翁雄地区，猛攻美国第十一装甲团，击毁M—41型坦克和M—113型装甲车二十二辆。
    当天晚上，西宁省游击队还巧妙地潜入北保地区的美军据点，用手榴弹消灭敌人四十五名。
    另据报道，今年一月份，西宁省各地游击队紧密配合解放军主力部队作战，在各地频频出击，消灭敌人大批有生力量。据统计，仅盏盆、杨明珠和周城三个县的游击队，就连续进行了七十多次战斗，共消灭敌人三百八十二名，其中包括美军和菲律宾帮凶军一百五十七名，击毁、击伤敌人装甲车十九辆和其他军车二辆，击落敌机四架。
    新华社六日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量六日清晨再次炮击朱莱美国空军基地。据西方通讯社初步消息透露，炮弹击中了机场保养工作地区和一些美军营房，一些飞机被击毁击伤，正在酣睡的一些美国侵略强盗被打死打伤。
    这是解放武装力量继二月份连续八次胜利袭击美军机场之后，向美国在南越的重要基地发动的又一次新的进攻。
    新华社河内六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方芹苴省解放武装力量，二月六日夜间猛烈袭击茶诺美军机场。
    据初步消息，解放武装力量的炮弹准确地命中目标，机场上的仓库中弹起火，一直燃烧到第二天下午。停放在机场上的美国飞机也被击毁和击伤多架。
    这是自去年二月十九日以来，芹苴省解放武装力量对这个美军机场进行的第四次猛烈袭击。
    据新华社河内电　越南《人民军队报》最近发表评论，热烈欢呼越南南方军民二月份在战场上取得的辉煌战功。
    评论说：在过去一个月里，解放武装力量英勇截击美国侵略军，使美国强盗对昆嵩、波来古、平定、西宁和边和等省进行的大规模“扫荡”，都遭到了惨败。解放武装力量主动出击敌人所取得的巨大胜利，粉碎了美国强盗妄图夺回战场上的一部分主动权的阴谋，同时为消灭敌人的有生力量作出了重大贡献。
    评论指出，很明显，在过去一个月里，解放武装力量继续保持和发挥了战场上的战略主动权。
